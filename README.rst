This repository will hold all data that is used
by the Mabhath website which can be found here:
`http://ejtaal.net/mabhath <http://ejtaal.net/mabhath>`_.

This repository **may be deleted and re-created** as
deleting/committing large amounts of binary files
would needlessly consume space on github's servers,
while only the most up to date version of the images
are required for the website to function.
