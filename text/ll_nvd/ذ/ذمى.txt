means Somewhat thereof was, or became, prepared<br>\
for me; or feasible, or practicable, to me: (M:)<br>\

thee; i. e. مَاارْتَفَعَ لَكَ. (S.)<br>\

اذماهُ He left him ill, or sick, (أَوْقَذَهُ, T, or<br>\
وَقَذَهُ, K, [which latter may mean thus, or he beat<br>\
him, or struck him, violently, or so that he became<br>\
at the point of death, &amp;c.,]) and left him at his<br>\
last gasp. (T, K.) And اذمى رَمِيَّتَهُ He failed<br>\
of hitting the animal at which he shot, or cast, in<br>\
a vital part, and therefore hastened to kill it:<br>\

slaughtered animal: see 1]: (T, M, K:) and<br>\
remains of the soul, or vital principle, (S, M, K,<br>\
and Meyd in explanation of a prov. cited in<br>\
what follows,) in a slaughtered animal: (S:) or<br>\
strength of heart: (M, K:) or the state between<br>\
slaughter and the exit of the soul; but there is no<br>\
ذَمَآء in the case of a human being: or strong<br>\
tenaciousness of life after slaughter. (Meyd in<br>\
explaining the prov. above referred to.) It is<br>\
said, الضَّبُّ أَطْوَلُ شَىْءٍ ذَمَآءً [The lizard called<br>\
ضبّ is the longest thing in retaining the remains<br>\
of life, &amp;c.]. (T, S.) Hence the prov., أَطْوَلُ<br>\
ذَمَآءً مِنَ الضَّبِّ [Longer in retaining the remains<br>\
of life, &amp;c., than the ضبّ]. (Meyd, TA.) ―<br>\
