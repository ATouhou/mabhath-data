ذَوَّلْتُ ذَالًا I wrote a ذ; (Az, Sgh, K;) or<br>\
ذَالًا حَسَنَةٌ [a beautiful ذ]. (B, TA.) [See also 2<br>\
in art. ذيل.]<br>\
ذَالٌ A certain letter of the alphabet, (Lth,<br>\
ISd, K,) [ذ,] pronounced with the voice, [not<br>\
with the breath only,] and always a radical, not<br>\
a substitute for another letter, nor augmentative;<br>\
(ISd, TA;) its place of utterance is at the roots<br>\
of the teeth, near the place of utterance of ت [or<br>\
ث]; and it may be masc. and fem.; (B, TA;)<br>\
[but generally it is fem.; and therefore] the dim.<br>\
is ↓ ذُوَيْلَةٌ: (K:) the pl. is أَذْوَالٌ and ذَالَاتٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The comb of a cock. (Kh, TA.)<br>\
ذَوِيلٌ, explained by IDrd as signifying What<br>\
is dry, of plants &amp;c., and so in the K, is said by<br>\
ISd to be correctly دَوِيلٌ [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
ذُوَيْلَةٌ: see ذَالٌ, above.<br>\
