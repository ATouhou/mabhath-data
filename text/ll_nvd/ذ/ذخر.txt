ذَخَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
ذَخَرَ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. ↓ ذُخْرٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) or this is a simple subst., and the inf. n. is<br>\
ذَخْرٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ اِدَّخَرَهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) of the<br>\
measure اِفْتَعَلَ, (S, Msb,) originally اِذْتَخَرَهُ, the<br>\
ت being changed into د, and the ذ being incorporated into it; and some of the Arabs say ↓ اِذَّخَرَهُ,<br>\
which is allowable; but the former is more common; (Zj;) He hoarded it, treasured it, or laid<br>\
it up for the future; reposited it, or stored it, in<br>\
secret; (A;) or he prepared it, or provided it;<br>\
(Msb;) for a time of need: (A, Msb:) or he<br>\
chose it, or selected it, and (so in some copies of the<br>\
K and in the TA, but in other copies of the K “ or ”)<br>\
took it for himself, or prepared it. (K.) Some<br>\
have made a distinction between ذخر and دخر,<br>\
saying that the former relates to the world to<br>\
come, and the latter to the present world; but<br>\
this is a manifest mistake. (MF and others.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
ذَخَرَ لِنَفْسِهِ حَدِيثًا حَسَنًا (A) (tropical:)  He reserved, or<br>\
preserved, for himself [a good story, or the like].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ذَخَرَ مِنْ عَدْوِهِ (tropical:)  [He (a horse) reserved<br>\
somewhat of his run, i. e., power of running, or<br>\
was sparing of it, for the time of need]. (M in<br>\
art. صون.) [See also مُدَّخِرٌ, below.] ―<br>\
-b4-  فُلَانٌ مَا<br>\
نُصْحًا ↓ يَدَّخِرُ (tropical:)  [Such a one does not treasure in<br>\
his heart good advice]. (A, TA.)<br>\

اِدَّخَرَ and<br>\
اِذَّخَرَ: see 1, in three places.<br>\
ذُخْرٌ: see 1: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see the next paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
ذَخِيرَةٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ ذَخْرٌ (A, Msb, * K)<br>\
A thing hoarded, treasured, or laid up; reposited,<br>\
or stored, in secret; (A;) or prepared, or provided;<br>\
(Msb;) for a time of need: (A, Msb:) or taken<br>\
for one&#39;s self, or prepared: (K:) pl. of the<br>\
former, ذَخَائِرُ; (S, A, Msb;) and of the latter, أَذْخَارٌ.<br>\
(Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say, عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ ↓ جَعَلَ مَا لَهُ ذُخْرًا<br>\
and ذَخِيرَةً (tropical:)  [He made his wealth to be a store in<br>\
the hands of God, by applying it to pious uses].<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And أَعْمَالُ المُؤمِنِ ذَخَائِرُ (tropical:)  [The works of<br>\
the believer are things laid up for the time of<br>\
need, i. e. the day of resurrection]. (A.)<br>\
ذَاخِرٌ (assumed tropical:)  Fat; as an epithet. (AA, K.)<br>\
إِذْخِرٌ [A kind of sweet rush; juncus odoratus;<br>\
or schœnanthum;] a certain plant, (S, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
or herb, (K,) well known, (Msb,) in form resembling the كَوْلَان [or papyrus-plant], (Mgh,)<br>\
sweet-smelling, (K,) or of pungent odour; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) which, when it dries, becomes white; (Msb;)<br>\
used for roofing houses, over the wood, and for<br>\
graves: (TA:) it has a root hidden in the ground,<br>\
slender, pungent in odour; and is like the straight<br>\
stalks of the كَوْلَان [or papyrus-plant], save that<br>\
it is wider, and smaller in the كُعُوب [which<br>\
means either the joints or the internodal portions];<br>\
and it has a fruit resembling the brooms of reeds,<br>\
but more slender, and smaller: it is ground, and<br>\
is an ingredient in perfumes: it grows in rugged<br>\
and in smooth grounds; but seldom does more<br>\
than one grow on the same spot: when it dries, it<br>\
becomes white: (AHn:) &#39;Iyád asserts that its ء is<br>\
a radical letter; but this is a mistake: (MF:) the<br>\
n. un. is إِذْخِرَةٌ; (S;) which is applied to a single<br>\
plant, (AHn,) or to a single fascicle thereof.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
مِذْخَرٌ (tropical:)  The [part of the intestines called] عَفَج:<br>\
(TA:) [its pl.] مَذَاخِرُ is also explained as signifying the intestines; and bellies; (S, K;) and<br>\
veins: (K:) or the lower part of the belly: (As,<br>\
K:) or the parts of the inside of a beast in which<br>\
he stores his fodder and water. (A.) You say<br>\
فُلَانٌ مَلَأَ مَذَاخِرَهُ (tropical:)  Such a one filled the lower parts<br>\
of his belly. (As.) And مَلَأَتِ الدَّابَّةُ مَذَاخِرَهَا<br>\
(tropical:)  The beast satiated itself. (TA.) And تَمَلَّأَتْ<br>\
مَذَاخِرُهُ (tropical:)  He became satiated. (A.) And مَلَأَ<br>\
لَنَا فِى مَذَاخِرِهِ عَدَاوَةً (tropical:)  [He filled his heart with<br>\
enmity towards us]. (A.)<br>\
مُدَّخِرٌ, or مُذَّخِرٌ, (accord. to different copies of<br>\
the K,) (assumed tropical:)  A horse that reserves his run; expl. by<br>\
المُبْقِى لِحُضْرِهِ: (AO, K, TA:) [Freytag&#39;s reading<br>\
of مُذَخَّرٌ for مُدَّخِرٌ or مُذَّخِرٌ, and his proposed<br>\
emendation, of المَنْقِىُّ for المُبْقِى, both taken from<br>\
the TK, but neither found by me in any copy of<br>\
the K, are evidently wrong: see ذَخَرَ مِنْ عَدْوِهِ,<br>\
above:] such is the مِسْوَاط, a horse “ that will<br>\
not give what he has without the whip: the fem.<br>\
is with ة. (TA.)<br>\
' } );
