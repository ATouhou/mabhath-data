ذَهَبَ, (S, A, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
ذَهَبَ, (A, K,) inf. n.<br>\
ذَهَابٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ذِهَابٌ (TA) and ذُهُوبٌ<br>\
(S, A, K) and مَذْهَبٌ, (A, K,) He (a man, S,<br>\
[and a beast,]) went [in any manner, or any pace];<br>\
went, or passed, along; marched; journeyed;<br>\
proceeded: went, or passed, away; departed:<br>\
syn. مَشَى, (A,) or سَارَ, (K,) or مَرّ: (S, A, K:)<br>\
and said of a mark or trace or the like [as<br>\
meaning it went away]. (Msb.) [And hence,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  It wasted away; became consumed, destroyed,<br>\
exhausted, spent, or expended.] ―<br>\
-b2-  ذَهَبَ إِلَيْهِ He<br>\
went, repaired, betook himself, or had recourse,<br>\
to him, or it. (TA.) And they say also, ذَهَبَ الشَّأْمَ<br>\
[He went to Syria]; making the verb trans.<br>\
without a particle; for although الشأم is here a<br>\
special adv. n., they liken it to a vague locality.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ذَهَبَ عَنْهُ He, or it, went from, quitted,<br>\
relinquished, or left, him, or it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
ذَهَبَ فِىالأَرْضِ, (A, Msb,) inf. n. ذَهَابٌ and<br>\
ذُهُوبٌ and مَذْهَبٌ, He went away [into the<br>\
country, or in the land]: (Msb:) [but it often<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  he went into the open country, or out of<br>\
doors, to satisfy a want of nature: or simply]<br>\
(tropical:)  he voided his excrement, or ordure. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
ذَهَبَ بِهِ He went, or went away, with him, or it:<br>\
(A:) and he made him, or it, to go, go away,<br>\
pass away, or depart; (A, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ اذهبهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) and بِهِ ↓ اذهب, (K,) but<br>\
this is rare; (Zj, TA;) and ↓ ذهّبهُ, inf. n. تَذْهِيبٌ:<br>\
(MF:) [all may likewise be rendered he removed,<br>\
dispelled, put away, or banished, it; properly and<br>\
tropically: and (assumed tropical:)  he made it to cease; made away<br>\
with it, did away with it, made an end of it;<br>\
wasted, consumed, destroyed, exhausted, spent, or<br>\
expended, it; and these meanings may perhaps<br>\
be intended by أَزَالَهُ, whereby the first is explained<br>\
in the A and K, as are also the second and third<br>\
in the K:] or, accord. to some, when ذَهَبَ is<br>\
trans. by means of بِ, accompaniment is necessarily signified; but not otherwise; so that if you<br>\
say ذَهَبَ بِهِ, the meaning is, he went away with<br>\
him, or it; i. e., accompanying him, or it; [he<br>\
took away, or carried off or away, him, or it;]<br>\
but if you say ↓ اذهبهُ or ↓ ذهّبهُ, the meaning is,<br>\
he made him, or it, to go, go away, pass away,<br>\
or depart, alone, without accompanying him, or<br>\
it: this, however, is not agreeable with the phrase<br>\
in the Kur [ii. 16], ذَهَبَ اللّٰهُ بِنُورِهِمْ [though this<br>\
may be well rendered God taketh away their<br>\
light]. (MF, TA.) [Hence,] one says, أَيْنَ<br>\
يُذْهَبُ بِكَ, which may mean (assumed tropical:)  Where, or whither,<br>\
wilt thou be taken away, and what will be done<br>\
with thee and made to come to pass with thee, if<br>\
this be thine intellect? or, accord. to Mtr, it is a<br>\
saying of the people of Baghdád, addressed to<br>\
him whom they charge with foolish judgment or<br>\
opinion, as meaning أَيْنَ يُذْهَبُ بِعَقْلِكَ (assumed tropical:)  [Where,<br>\
or whither, is thine intellect taken away?]. (Har<br>\
p. 574.) [In like manner one says, ذَهَبَ عَقْلُهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  His reason, or intellect, quitted him, or forsook<br>\
him; he became bereft of his reason, or intellect.<br>\
And ذَهَبَ فُؤَادُهُ (assumed tropical:)  His heart forsook him, or<br>\
failed him, by reason of fear or the like.] And<br>\
ذَهَبَ لَحْمُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [His flesh wasted away]. (K in<br>\
art. بحر, &amp;c.) And ذَهَبَ الرَّجُلُ فِى القَوْمِ (tropical:)  The<br>\
man became lost [or he disappeared] among the<br>\
people, or party. (A.) And ذَهَبَ المَآءَ فِى اللَّبَنِ<br>\
(tropical:)  The water became lost [or it disappeared] in the<br>\
milk. (A.) ―<br>\
-b6-  ذَهَبَ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  It escaped his memory;<br>\
he forgot it. (A, TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  It was, or became,<br>\
dubious, confused, or vague, to him. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
ذَهَبَ مَذْهَبًا حَسَنًا (S, A, TA) (tropical:)  He pursued a good<br>\
way, course, mode, or manner, of acting or conduct<br>\
or the like. (TA.) And ذَهَبَ فِى الدِّينِ مَذْهَبًا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He formed, or held, an opinion, or a persuasion,<br>\
or a belief, respecting religion: or, accord. to<br>\
Es-Sarakustee, he introduced an innovation in<br>\
religion. (Msb.) And ذَهَبَ مَذْهَبَ فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
pursued the way, course, mode, or manner, of<br>\
acting &amp;c. of such a one. (Msb.) And ذَهَبَ لِذَهْبِهِ<br>\
and لِمَذْهَبِهِ (tropical:)  He pursued his way, course,<br>\
mode, or manner, of acting &amp;c. (JK, TA.) And<br>\
ذَهَبَ إِلَى مَذْهَبٍ (tropical:)  He betook himself to [or took<br>\
to or held] a belief, a creed, a persuasion, a<br>\
doctrine, an opinion, a tenet, or a body of tenets<br>\
or articles of belief. (K, TA.) And فُلَانٌ يَذْهَبُ<br>\
إِلَى قَوْلِ أَبِى حَنِيفَةَ (tropical:)  Such a one takes to, or<br>\
holds, [the saying, or] the belief, creed, persuasion,<br>\
doctrine, &amp;c., of Aboo-Haneefeh. (A.) [And<br>\
ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَنَّ الأَمْرَ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He held, or was of<br>\
opinion, that the thing, or affair, or case, was<br>\
so. And ذَهَبَ بِلَفْظٍ إِلَىلَفْظٍ آخَرَ (assumed tropical:)  He regarded<br>\
a word, or an expression, in his manner of using<br>\
it, as equivalent to another word, or expression;<br>\
as, for instance, when one makes a fem. noun<br>\
masc. because it is syn. with a noun that is masc.,<br>\
or makes a verb trans. by means of a certain perticle because it is syn. with a verb that is trans. by<br>\
means of that same particle: and also (assumed tropical:)  he regarded a word, or an expression, as etymologically<br>\
relating, or traceable, to another word, or expression. And ذَهَبَ بِهِ إِلَى مَعْنَى كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
regarded it, or used it, (i. e. a word, or an expression,) as relating to such a meaning, or as<br>\
meaning such a thing.] ―<br>\
-b8-  ذَهَبَ فِى طَلَبِ الشَّىْءِ<br>\
كُلَّ مَذْهَبٍ (assumed tropical:)  [He tried every way, or did his<br>\
utmost, in seeking the thing]. (K in art. موت.)<br>\

-A2-<br>\
ذَهِبَ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
ذَهَبَ, (K,) inf. n. ذَهَبٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and ذِهِبَ, with two kesrehs, (IAar, K,) of the<br>\
dial. of Temeem, held by AM to be a variation<br>\
generally allowable in the case of a verb of which<br>\
the medial radical letter is a faucial and with<br>\
kesr; (TA;) He (a man) saw gold in the mine,<br>\
(S,) or came suddenly, in the mine, upon much<br>\
gold, and his reason departed in consequence<br>\
thereof, (K,) and his eyes became dazzled, so as<br>\
not to close, or move, the lids, or became confused,<br>\
so as not to see, (S, K,) by reason of the greatness<br>\
thereof in his eye: (S:) it is derived from ذَهَبٌ:<br>\
and the epithet applied to a man in this case is<br>\
↓ ذَهِبٌ. (TA.)<br>\

Q. Q. 2<br>\
تَمَذْهَبَ, from مَذْهَبٌ, is used by<br>\
late writers as meaning (assumed tropical:)  He followed, or adopted,<br>\
a certain religious persuasion or the like.]<br>\
ذَهْبٌ: see مَذْهَبٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and see also the last<br>\
sentence of the paragraph here following.<br>\
ذَهَبٌ [Gold;] a certain thing well known;<br>\
(S, Msb, &amp;c.;) accord. to several of the leading<br>\
lexicologists, (TA,) i. q. تِبْرٌ; (A, L, K, &amp;c.;)<br>\
but it seems to have a more general meaning; for<br>\
تِبْرٌ is specially applied to such [gold] as is in the<br>\
mine, or such as is uncoined and unwrought:<br>\
(TA:) [it is a coll. gen. n.; and therefore] it is<br>\
masc. and fem.: (S, * Msb, K, * TA:) or it is fem.<br>\
in the dial. of El-Hijáz: or, accord. to Az, it<br>\
is masc., and not to be made fem. unless regarded<br>\
as pl. of ↓ ذَهَبَةٌ, (Msb, TA,) [or rather as a coll.<br>\
gen. n., for] ذَهَبَةٌ is the n. un., (K,) signifying<br>\
a piece of ذَهَب [or gold]: (S, A, L, TA:) or,<br>\
accord. to El-Kurtubee, it is fem., and sometimes<br>\
masc., but more commonly fem.: ↓ ذُهَيْبَةٌ is the<br>\
dim. of ذَهَبٌ, the ة being added because the<br>\
latter word is fem., like as it is in قُوَيْسَةٌ and<br>\
شُمَيْسَةٌ; or it is the dim. of ذَهَبَةٌ, and signifies a little piece of ذَهَب [or gold]: (TA:) the pl. of ذَهَبٌ is<br>\
أَذْهَابٌ [a pl. of pauc.] (S, A, Msb, K) and ذُهُوبٌ<br>\
(S, K) and ذُهْبَانٌ (Nh, Msb, K) and ذِهْبَانٌ. (Nh,<br>\
