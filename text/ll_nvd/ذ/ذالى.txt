ذَلَىالرُّطَبَ, like سَعَى, (K,) [i. e.,] aor.<br>\
ذَاَلَ,<br>\
inf. n. ذَلْىٌ, (TA,) He gathered the fresh ripe<br>\
dates: (K:) so in the copies of the K; in which<br>\
is added, فَانْذَلَى مَعَهُ: but what we find in the<br>\
Tekmileh is this: ظلّ يذلى الرطب اى يجنيه<br>\
فينذلى معه: and يذلى is written as [the aor. of]<br>\
a quadriliteral [i. e. as the aor. of اذلى, for it is<br>\
without a sheddeh]: (TA:) [here, however,<br>\
فينذلى is evidently, in my opinion, a mistranscription for فَيَتَدَلَّى; and the right reading and<br>\
rendering I therefore hold to be as follows:<br>\
الرُّطَبَ ↓ ظَلَّ يُذْلِى, or perhaps يَذْلَى, means He<br>\
continued gathering the fresh ripe dates, they<br>\
hanging down with him: for the gatherer laying<br>\
hold upon the raceme, it hangs down with his<br>\
weight. In the TK, this passage in the TA has<br>\
been misunderstood and misrepresented, as though<br>\
it meant that أَذْلَى مَعَهُ signifies “ he gathered<br>\
with him. ”]<br>\

أَذْاَلَ see the preceding paragraph.<br>\

تذلّى i. q. تذلّل [He became lowly, humble,<br>\
or submissive; or he lowered, humbled, or submitted, himself]: (T, K:) the latter verb is the<br>\
original: the former being like تظنّى, originally<br>\
تظنّن. (T.) [See also the next paragraph.]<br>\
12<br>\
اِذْلَوْلَى, (T, S, M, K,) inf. n. اِذْلِيلَآءٌ, (S,)<br>\
He went away hiding himself; stole away<br>\
secretly. (T, S, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He hastened, made<br>\
haste, sped, or went quickly; (TA;) [like ادلولى;]<br>\
and (TA) he did so in fear lest a thing should<br>\
escape him. (T, TA.) And اذلولى فَذَهَبَ He<br>\
went back, or away, running quickly. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
He was, or became, easy, tractable, submissive,<br>\
or manageable. (M, K.) [See also 5.] ―<br>\
-b4-  He<br>\
(a man) was, or became, broken-hearted. (T, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  It (the ذَكَر) stood in a lax state. (T, K.)<br>\
ذَلَوْلًى, [in copies of the K ذَلَولَى,] applied<br>\
to a man, i. q. مُذْلَوْلٍ [part. n. of 12, q. v.]:<br>\
(K, TA: [in some copies of the K مَذْلُولٌ:]) of<br>\
the measure فَعَوْعَلٌ; or, as some say, فَعَلْعَلٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رِشَآءٌ مُذْلَوْلٍ [A well-rope] unsteady; or moving<br>\
about, or to and fro, or from side to side. (T.)<br>\
