ذَرَأَ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
ذَرَاَ, (S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. ذَرْءٌ, (S, M, Msb,) He (God) created, syn.<br>\
خَلَقَ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) الخَلْقَ [the creation;<br>\
i. e. the things that are created]. (T, S, M, Msb.)<br>\
وَلَقَدْ ذَرَأْنَا لِجَهَنَّمَ كَثِيرًا مِنَ الْجِنِّ وَ الْإِنْسِ, in the<br>\
Kur [vii. 178], means [And verily] we have<br>\
created [for Hell many of the jinn, or genii, and<br>\
of mankind]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He multiplied, or made<br>\
numerous. (K.) يَذْرَؤُكُمْ فِيهِ, in the Kur [xlii. 9],<br>\
means He multiplieth you thereby; i. e., by<br>\
making of you, and of the cattle, pairs, males and<br>\
females: so says Zj; and Fr says the like; and<br>\
this is a correct explanation. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also,<br>\
(S, M, K,) and so ذَرَا, (TA,) He sowed land:<br>\
(S, M, K, TA:) but the latter verb is said to be<br>\
the more chaste. (MF.)<br>\
-A2-  ذَرَأَ فُوهُ His teeth fell<br>\
out from his mouth; (K, TA;) as also ذَرَا and<br>\
ذَرَى, without ء: (TA:) but the most chaste is<br>\
said to be without ء: ذَرَأَ, with ء, is said to be of<br>\
weak authority, or a mispronunciation. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
ذَرِئَ, (M, K,) or ذَرِئَ شَعَرَهُ, (S,) aor.<br>\
ذَرَاَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. ذَرَأٌ; (S, * M, O;) and ذَرَأَ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
ذَرَاَ;<br>\
(K;) and ذَرُؤَ, aor.<br>\
ذَرُاَ; (Ktr, TA;) His hair<br>\
became white, or hoary, in the fore part of his<br>\
head: (S:) or he had whiteness intermixed with<br>\
blackness in the hair of his head: (M:) or his<br>\
hair became white, or hoary: (K:) or he began<br>\
to become white, or hoary, (M, K,) in the fore<br>\
part of his head, (K,) or in the upper part of<br>\
each side of the head. (A, TA.) The epithet is<br>\
↓ أَذْرَأُ; fem. ذَرْآءٌ. (S, M, K. [In some copies of<br>\
the K, ذَرْأَى is erroneously put for ذَرْآءُ.])<br>\
4<br>\
اذرأهُ He angered him; provoked him to<br>\
anger. (T, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اذرأهُ بِصَاحِبِهِ He incited<br>\
him against his companion. (AZ, T.) And اذرأهُ<br>\
بِالشَّىْءِ He incited him, or urged him, to do, or<br>\
attempt, the thing. (M, K.) And اذرأهُ إِلَىكَذَا<br>\
He constrained him, or compelled him, to have<br>\
recourse to, or to do, such a thing. (K, * TA.)<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd mentions أَذْرَى, without ء; but &#39;Alee<br>\
Ibn-Hamzeh asserts that this is incorrect. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  اذرأ الدَّمْعَ He, or it, made tears to flow.<br>\
(K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And اذرأه He frightened him.<br>\
(M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  أَذْرَأَتْ She (a camel) excerned (أَنْزَلَتْ)<br>\
the milk (M, K, TA) from [app. a mistake for<br>\
into] her udder: a dial. var. of أَدْرَأَتْ [q. v.].<br>\
(TA.) The epithet applied to the she-camel so<br>\
doing is ↓ مُذْرِئٌ. (M, K.)<br>\
ذَرْءٌ The act of creating; inf. n. of ذَرَأَ. (S, M,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And used in the sense of the pass.<br>\
part. n. of that verb; and alike as sing. and pl.<br>\
because originally an inf. n.] ذَرْءُ النَّارِ, (S, K,<br>\
TA,) [for ذَرْءٌ لِلنَّارِ,] related as occurring in a trad.<br>\
(S, TA) of &#39;Omar, (TA,) means Created [i. e.<br>\
destined] for the fire [of Hell]: (S, K, TA:)<br>\
but as some relate it, the phrase is ذَرْوُ النَّارِ,<br>\
meaning [either “ the children of the fire,” agreeably with what next follows, or] “ to be scattered<br>\
in the fire. ” (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The number of<br>\
[ones] offspring: one says, أَنْمَىاللّٰهُ ذَرْأَكَ May<br>\
God increase [the number of] thine offspring;<br>\
as also ذَرْوَكَ. (T.)<br>\
-A2-  Somewhat; (M, K;) as<br>\
in the saying, بَلَغَنِى ذَرْءٌ مِنْ خَبَرٍ [Somewhat of<br>\
news, or information, reached me, or came to my<br>\
knowledge]: (K, TA:) or ذَرْءٌ مِنْ خَيْرٍ [somewhat of good]: (so in some copies of the K and<br>\
M:) thus ذرء is written by IAth: in some copies<br>\
of the K, ذُرْءٌ, with damm: (TA:) or ذَرْءٌ here<br>\
means a little; and ذَرْوٌ is a dial. var. thereof.<br>\
(M in art. ذرو.) Also A little of what is said.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  A thing intervening as a separation or<br>\
an obstacle: so in the saying, مَا بَيْنَنَا وَ بَيْنَهُ ذَرْءٌ<br>\
[There is not anything intervening &amp;c. between<br>\
us and him, or it]. (K, * TA.)<br>\
ذَرَأٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
ذُرْأَةٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ ذَرَأٌ, (S,) the latter an<br>\
inf. n. (M, [see 1,]) the former a simple subst.,<br>\
(S,) Whiteness, or hoariness, in the fore part of<br>\
the head: (S:) or whiteness intermixed with<br>\
blackness in the hair of the head: (M:) or whiteness, or hoariness, of the hair: (K:) or the<br>\
beginning of whiteness or hoariness (M, K) in the<br>\
fore part of the head, (K,) or in the upper part<br>\
of each side of the head. (A, TA.)<br>\
ذَرْآنِىٌّ and ذَرَآنِىٌّ Intensely white salt: (S, M,<br>\
K:) derived from ذُرْأَةٌ: one should not say<br>\
أَنْذَرَانِىٌّ; (S, K;) for this is a vulgarism: some<br>\
pronounce it with the unpointed د. (TA.)<br>\
ذَرِىْءٌ Sown seed. (S, M, K.)<br>\
ذُرِّيَّةٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, K) and ذِرِّيَّةٌ (M, K) and<br>\
ذَرِّيَّةٌ, (K,) [or ذَرِيَّةٌ, without a sheddeh to the ر,<br>\
accord. to the Msb in art. ذر,] always pronounced<br>\
by the Arabs without ء: (S:) accord. to some,<br>\
(TA,) from الذَّرْءُ; (M, TA;) so says Th; (M;)<br>\
the measure of the first being فُعُّولَةٌ or فُعِّيلَةٌ; [so<br>\
that it is originally ذُرُّوءَةٌ or ذُرِّيْئَةٌ;] (TA;) but the ء<br>\
is suppressed because of frequency of usage: (M:)<br>\
accord. to others, from الذَّرُّ, signifying “ the act of<br>\
scattering; ” because God scattered the ذرّيّة upon the<br>\
earth; and the measure is فُعْلِيَّةٌ or فُعُّولَةٌ, [if the<br>\
latter,] the word being originally ذُرُّورَةٌ, the last<br>\
ر being changed into ى, in a manner similar to<br>\
the case of تَقَضَّتِ العُقَابِ [in which تَقَضَّضَت<br>\
becomes تَقَضَّيَت and then تَقَضَّت; so that ذُرُّورَةٌ<br>\
becomes ذُرُّويَةٌ and then ذُرِّيَّةٌ]: (TA:) Children,<br>\
or offspring, (T, S, Mgh, K,) of a man, and used<br>\
as a sing. also, (Mgh,) or of men and of jinn, or<br>\
genii: (S, K:) pl. [ذُرِّيَّاتٌ (see art. ذر) and sometimes] ذَرَارِىُّ. (S.) Hence, هَبْ لِى مِنْ لَدُنْكَ<br>\
ذُرِّيَّةً طَيِّبَةً [in the Kur iii. 33, meaning Give me,<br>\
from Thee, a good offspring]. (Mgh.) And in a<br>\
trad. of Ibn-&#39;Omar, فَجَعَلَنِى فِى الذُّرِّيَّةِ means<br>\
And he put me among the little ones, or young<br>\
ones. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also applied to signify<br>\
Progenitors: as in the saying, in the Kur<br>\
[xxxvi. 41], حَمَلْنَا ذُرِّيَّتَهُمْ فِى الْفُلْكِ المَشْحُونِ<br>\
[We carried their progenitors in the laden ark].<br>\
(T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And it is used also to signify Women;<br>\
[because they are the sources of offspring;] (T,<br>\
Mgh, TA;) like as سَمَآءٌ is used to signify “ rain: ”<br>\
(TA:) as in the saying of &#39;Omar, حُجُّوا بِالذُّرِّيَّةِ<br>\
[Perform ye the pilgrimage with the women].<br>\
(T, Mgh, TA. [See his saying in full, voce<br>\
رِبْقٌ.])<br>\
الذَّارِئُ an epithet applied to God, The Creator.<br>\
(T.)<br>\
أَذْرَأُ; fem. ذَرْآءُ: see 1, last sentence. Applied to<br>\
a ram, Having whiteness in the head; (M, K;)<br>\
and so the fem. applied to a ewe: (M:) or having<br>\
the ears variegated, or speckled, with black and<br>\
white, and the rest black: (K:) or it has this<br>\
latter meaning when applied to a horse, and to a<br>\
kid; and so the fem. applied to a female kid,<br>\
(S, O,) or to a she-goat: (M:) and is not applied<br>\
to the sheep-kind. (S, O.)<br>\
مُذْرِئٌ: see 4, last sentence.<br>\
