ذَرُ3َ, (M, TA,) inf. n. ذَرٌّ, (K, TA,) He put the<br>\

-b2-  Also, (A,) inf. n. as above, (K,) He<br>\

(tropical:)  God spread his servants, or mankind, upon the<br>\
earth. (M, * A.) Whence the word ذُرِّيَّةٌ. (M,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And ذَرَّتِ الأَرْضُ النَّبْتَ The ground put<br>\
forth the plant, or plants. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  ذَرَّ, (T, S, M,<br>\
K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\

inf. n. ذُرُورٌ, (M,) It (a herb, or leguminous<br>\
plant,) came up, or forth, (IAar, AZ, T, S, K,)<br>\
from the ground: (AZ, S:) or it (a herb, or<br>\
leguminous plant, and a horn,) began to come<br>\
forth; put forth the smallest portion of itself.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\

ذُرُورٌ, (S, M,) (tropical:)  The sun rose; (S, M, K;) and<br>\

ذَارَّتْ, (aor. تُذَارُّ, S,) inf. n. مُذَارَّةٌ and ذِرَارٌ,<br>\
She (a camel) became evil in her disposition.<br>\
(Fr, S, K.) Hence the saying of Hoteiäh, satirizing Ez-Zibrikán, and praising the family of<br>\
Shemmás Ibn-Láy,<br>\
وَكُنْتَ كَذَاتِ البَوِّ ذَارَتْ بِأَنْفِهَا<br>\

near her that she may incline to it and yield her<br>\
milk,] that has inclined to the young one of<br>\
another; [and on that account desires its distance<br>\
from her, and severs herself from it:] in the S<br>\
we find, for البَوِّ, البَعْلِ; and for بُعْدَهُ, غَيْرَهُ; but<br>\
the former are the correct readings: ذَارَتْ is a<br>\
contraction of ذَارَّتْ: or, accord. to some, it is for<br>\
ذَآءَرَتْ: see art. ذأر. (IB and TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says<br>\
also, فِى فُلَانٍ ذِرَارٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  In such a one is<br>\
aversion, arising from anger, like that of a she-camel: (AZ, S:) or anger and aversion (Th, M,<br>\
K, TA) and disapprobation. (Th, TA)<br>\

and when powdered, it is a perfume, inclining to<br>\
yellowness and whiteness: (Sgh, Msb:) or, as<br>\
some say, it is a mixed kind of perfume: (TA:)<br>\
