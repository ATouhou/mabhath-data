ذَاقَهُ, (K,) first pers. ذُقْتُهُ, aor. أَذُوقْهُ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. ذَوْقٌ and ذَوَاقٌ and مَذَاقٌ (S, Msb, K)<br>\
and مَذَاقَةٌ, (S, K,) He tasted it; i. e., perceived<br>\
its taste, by means of the moisture of the tongue:<br>\
(Msb:) or he tried, or knew, its taste: (K:)<br>\
it is originally said of that of which little is taken:<br>\
when much is taken, the term أَكْلٌ is used [and<br>\
one says أَكَلَهُ]: and ↓ تذاوقهُ signifies the same<br>\
as ذَاقَهُ. (TA.) You say, ذُقْتُ الشَّىْءَ [I tasted<br>\
the thing], (S,) or الطَّعَامَ [the food]. (Msb.)<br>\
And يَوْمٌ مَا ذُقْتُهُ طَعَامًا, meaning مَا ذُقْتُ فِيهِ [i. e.<br>\
A day in which I tasted not food]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
By amplification, الذَّوْقُ is used to signify (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
perceiving, beside tastes, all other objects of the<br>\
senses, and states or conditions: (Bd in iii. 177:)<br>\
it is not restricted to the sense of the mouth [or<br>\
tongue] in the language of the Kur-án nor in the<br>\
[genuine or classical] language of the [Pagan]<br>\
Arabs. (TA.) Hence, in the Kur iii. 177,<br>\
ذُوقُوا عَذَابَ الحَرِيقِ (assumed tropical:)  [Taste ye the punishment of<br>\
burning]: (Bd, TA:) for, although, in the common conventional acceptation, the verb relates to<br>\
what is little in quantity, it is regarded as suitable<br>\
to be used in relation to what is much. (TA.)<br>\
One says also, فُلَانٌ ذَاقَ كَذَا وَأَنَا أَكَلْتُهُ [lit.<br>\
Such a one tasted such a thing, and I ate it;]<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  such a one knew, or tried or tested,<br>\
such a thing, and I knew it, or tried it or tested<br>\
it, more. (TA.) ذُقْتُ الشَّىْءَ means (assumed tropical:)  I tried, or<br>\
tested, the thing. (Msb.) And hence one says,<br>\
ذاق فُلَانٌ البَأْسَ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one experienced harm,<br>\
&amp;c.; i. e., knew it by its befalling him. (Msb.)<br>\
And ذُقْتُ مَا عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  I knew, or tried or<br>\
tested, what [qualities &amp;c.] such a one possessed;<br>\
(S, TA;) and so ذُقْتُ فُلَانًا. (TA.) And ذَاقَ<br>\
الرَّجُلُ عُسَيْلَةَ المَرْأَةِ وَ ذَاقَتْ عُسَيْلَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  The man<br>\
[tasted or] experienced the sweetness of the carnal<br>\
enjoyment of the woman, and she in like manner.<br>\
(Msb.) And ذاق طَعْمَ الإِيمَانِ (assumed tropical:)  He tasted, or<br>\
experienced, the savour of faith with his heart,<br>\
like as the mouth tastes, or experiences, the<br>\
savour of food and drink. (TA from a trad.)<br>\
And ذُقْتُ كَذِبَهُ وَخَبَرْتُ حَالَهُ (tropical:)  [I experienced<br>\
his lying, and knew his condition]. (TA.) And<br>\
ذَاقَتْهَا يَدِى, and ذَاقَتْ فُلَانَةَ, (tropical:)  My hand felt her,<br>\
and felt such a female. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ذاق القَوْسَ,<br>\
(S, K,) inf. n. ذَوْقٌ; (TA;) [and ↓ ذَوَّقَهَا; (so in<br>\
Freytag&#39;s Lex. from the Deewán el-Hudhaleeyeen;)] (tropical:)  He pulled the string of the bow<br>\
(S, K, TA) for the purpose of trial, (K, TA,)<br>\
that he might see what was its strength. (S, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  ↓ الذَّوْقُ is also employed to signify (assumed tropical:)  [Taste,<br>\
as meaning intellectual discernment and relish;<br>\
i. e.] the faculty that is adapted to the acquisition of matters of knowledge, considered as being,<br>\
in its perfection of perception, like sensation,<br>\
regarded as a natural property; and particularly<br>\
that [faculty] which concerns the niceties of language; because it [i. e. nice language] is, to the<br>\
soul of man, like delicious intellectual food.<br>\
(Kull. [When used as a subst in this sense, its<br>\
pl. is أَذْوَاقٌ.]) One says, هُوَحَسَنُ الذَّوْقِ لِلشِّعْرِ,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  He has a good [taste or] natural<br>\
faculty for poetry. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Also (assumed tropical:)  Voluptuousness; sensuality: see ذَوَّاقٌ.]<br>\
2<br>\
ذوّقهُ [He gave him something to taste]: it<br>\
is like لَمَّجَهُ. (M and TA in art. لمظ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also 1, in the latter half of the paragraph.<br>\

I made him to taste the food; i. e., to perceive<br>\
its taste by means of the moisture of the tongue:<br>\
(Msb:) or I made him to try, or know, the<br>\
taste [of the food]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] أَذَاقَهُ اللّٰهُ<br>\
وَبَالَ أَمْرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [God made him to taste, or experience, the evil result of his affair]. (S.) It is<br>\
said in the Kur [xvi. 113], فَأَذَاقَهَااللّٰهُ لِبَاسَ الجُوْعِ<br>\
وَالخَوْفِ (assumed tropical:)  [So God made her to taste, or experience, the utmost degree of hunger and of fear]:<br>\
the verb is here used with لِبَاس because meant to<br>\
convey the meaning of experiencing: or the sentence is elliptical, and means, made them to taste,<br>\
or experience, hunger and fear, and clad them<br>\
with the clothing thereof. (TA.) And in the same<br>\
[xlii. 47], إِذَا أَذَقْنَا الإِنْسَانُ مِنَّا رَحْمَةً (assumed tropical:)  [When<br>\
we make man to taste, or experience, mercy from<br>\
us]; where, afterwards, الإِصَابَةٌ is opposed to<br>\

-b3-<br>\
أَذَاقَ زَيْدٌ بَعْدَكَ كَرَمًا means (tropical:)  Zeyd became generous<br>\
[after thee, i. e. after thou knewest him, or sawest<br>\

الفَرَسُ بَعْدَكَ عَدْوًا (tropical:)  The horse became a good runner<br>\

(Aboo-Hamzeh, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تذوّقهُ He tasted it (ذَاقَهُ, S, K) by degrees,<br>\
(S,) or repeatedly. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] دَعْنِى أَتَذَوَّقُ<br>\
طَعْمَ فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  [Let me try, or test, the character<br>\
of such a one]. (TA.) And تَذَوَّقْتُ طَعْمَ فِرَاقِهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [I tasted, or experienced, the savour of his<br>\
separation]. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَذَاْوَقَ see 1, first sentence. [The primary signification of تَذَاوُقٌ seems to be The tasting a thing<br>\
one with another. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] تذاوقوا الرِّمَاحَ<br>\
i. q. تَنَاوَلُوهَا (tropical:)  [They took the spears, one from<br>\
another, app. to test their qualities: see ذَاقَ القَوْسَ,<br>\

أَيْدِى التِجَارِ فَزَادُوا مَتْنَهُ لِينَا<br>\
(tropical:)  [Or like the quivering of a well-straightened<br>\
spear (lit. a spear of Rudeyneh, a woman famous<br>\
for the straightening of spear-shafts, accord. to<br>\
the explanation commonly received,) which the<br>\
hands of the dealers have taken, one from another,<br>\
to test its quality, so that they have made the<br>\
middle of it to increase in suppleness]. (TA.)<br>\

اِسْتَذَاقَ فُلَانًا خُبْرَهُ فَلَمْ يَحْمَدْ مَخْبَرَتَهُ (tropical:)  [app.<br>\

the knowledge of his internal state, and did not<br>\
approve his internal state: see the pass, part. n.<br>\

syllabical signs.) ―<br>\
-b2-  استذاق الأَمْرُ لِفُلَانٍ (tropical:)  The<br>\
affair was, or became, easy, or feasible, to such a<br>\
one. (JK, TA.) You say, لَا يَسْتَذِيقُ لِىَ الشِّعْرُ<br>\
إِلَّ فِى فُلَانِ (tropical:)  [Poetry, or versification, will not<br>\
be easy, or feasible, to me, except in relation to<br>\
such a one]. (TA.)<br>\
ذَوْقٌ an inf. n. used as a simple subst.; pl.<br>\
أَذْوَاقٌ: see 1, in the latter part of the paragraph.<br>\
ذَوَاقٌ an inf. n.: and also a subst. signifying A<br>\

يَمْدَحُهُ, i. e. [He used not to praise] what was<br>\
tasted [by him nor to dispraise it]. (JM.) And<br>\
one says, مَا ذُقْتُ ذَوَاقًا, meaning I tasted not<br>\
anything. (S, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence it is said in a trad.,<br>\
كَانُوا إِذَا خَرَجُوا مِنْ عِنْدِهِ لَا يَتَفَرَّقُونَ إِلَّا عَنْ ذَوَاقٍ,<br>\
i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [They used, when they went forth from<br>\
