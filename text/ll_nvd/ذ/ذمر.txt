for they say حَامِىالذِّمَارِ, [see below,] like as<br>\
they say حَامِى الحَقِيقَةِ; and those things are<br>\
termed ذمار because anger (تَذَمُّرٌ) on their account<br>\

they are termed حقيقة because it is the duty of<br>\
him to whom they pertain to defend them. (S.)<br>\

مُذَمِّرٌ A man who inserts his hand into the vulva<br>\
of a she-camel, to discover if her fœtus be a male<br>\
or a female: (S, M, K:) because he feels its مُذَمَّر,<br>\
and thus knows it: he feels its jaw-bones: if they<br>\
be thick, it is a male; and if thin, a female. (M.)<br>\
El-Kumeyt says,<br>\
وَقَالَ المُذَمِّرُ لِلنَّاتِجِينَ<br>\
مَتَى ذُمِّرَتْ قَبْلِىَ الأَرْجُلُ<br>\
[And he whose business it was to feel the fœtus,<br>\
for the purpose of discovering if it were male or<br>\
female, said to those assisting the she-camels in<br>\
bringing forth, When, before my time, were the<br>\
legs felt to discover the sex of the fœtus?]: (S,<br>\
