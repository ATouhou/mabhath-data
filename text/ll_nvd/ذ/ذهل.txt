ذَهَلَ عَنْهُ, (JK, S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
ذَهَلَ, (S, K,)<br>\
inf. n. ذَهْلٌ, (JK, S,) or ذُهُولٌ, (Msb,) or both;<br>\
(K;) and ذَهِلَ, (S, Msb,) aor.<br>\
ذَهَلَ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
ذُهُولٌ; (S;) He forgot it, or neglected it; (S;)<br>\
he was, or became, unmindful of it; (S, Msb:) or<br>\
he neglected it intentionally; (JK, T, M, K, *<br>\
TA; عَلَى عَهْدٍ in the K being a mistake for<br>\
على عَمْدٍ, as in the [JK and T and] M; TA;) or<br>\
in consequence of his being diverted by something:<br>\
(T, K:) or he forgot it, or dismissed it from his<br>\
mind, intentionally, and became diverted from it:<br>\
(Z, Msb:) ذُهُولٌ is the neglecting a thing, dismissing it from the mind: (Ham p. 31:) or the<br>\
quitting a thing, with confusion, or perplexity, or<br>\
alienation of mind, such as arises from fear &amp;c.:<br>\
(Ksh and Bd in xxii. 2:) or the being diverted<br>\
from one&#39;s constant companion, or familiar, so<br>\
as to forget him; and being content to relinquish<br>\
him: (K;) or diversion that occasions grief and<br>\
forgetfulness. (Er-Rághib, TA.) Hence, in the<br>\
Kur [xxii. 2], يَوْمَ تَرَوْنَهَا تَذْهَلُ كُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ عَمَّا<br>\
أَرْضَعَتٌ [On the when thou shalt see it, every<br>\
woman giving suck shall forget, or neglect, &amp;c.,<br>\
what she has suckled]. (TA.)<br>\

(TA,) It (a thing, JK, S, TA,) or he, (a man,<br>\
Msb,) caused me to forget it, or neglect it; (S;)<br>\
or to be unmindful of it; (S, Msb;) or to neglect<br>\
it intentionally: (JK:) [like أَذَهَنَنِى عنه:] and<br>\
sometimes one says ↓ ذَهَلَنِى; (Msb, TA;) [like<br>\
ذَهَنَنى;] but this is rare; or, rather, unknown.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
ذَهْلٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
جَآءَ بَعْدَ ذُهْلٍ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ, (S, K, *) and ↓ ذَهْلٍ,<br>\
(S, K,) He came after a short portion, or a<br>\
period, (سَاعَة, K, or هَدْء, S,) of the night: (S,<br>\
K:) so called because sleep causes men to forget<br>\
(يُذْهِلُ النَّاسَ) therein: (Ham p. 4:) or a large<br>\
portion; such as the third, or the half: so says<br>\
IDrd; but he doubts its correctness; and ISd<br>\
holds it to be preferably with د. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  ذُهْلٌ<br>\
also signifies The tree [or plant] بَشَام [q. v.].<br>\
(JK, Sgh, K.)<br>\

-b2-  And] A man who<br>\
cares not for ornament and the anointing of<br>\
himself. (JK.)<br>\
