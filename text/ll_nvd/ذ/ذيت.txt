ذَيْتِ وَذَيْتِ and ذَيْتُ وَذَيتُ, (K,) the last of which<br>\
is unknown, except as mentioned by IKtt, (TA,)<br>\
and ذَيَّةَ وَذَيَّةَ (M, K) and ذَيَّآءَ وَذَيَّآءَ, (K,) i. q.<br>\
كَيْتَ وَكَيْتَ: (AO, S, M, Msb, * K:) so in the<br>\
saying, كَانَ مِنَ الأَمْرِ ذَيْتَ وَذَيْتَ [&amp;c., Some of<br>\
the circumstances of the case were thus and thus,<br>\
or so and so, or such and such things]. (AO, S,<br>\
M.) It is plainly implied in the K [and the S]<br>\
that the ت in ذيت is a radical letter, the last<br>\
radical letter of the word: but AHei says that the<br>\
ت in ذيت and كيت is substituted for ى; that<br>\
they are originally ذَيَّةَ and كَيَّةَ; and that the ة<br>\
is elided, and the ى which is the last radical<br>\
letter is changed into ت: [in like manner also<br>\
says ISd in the M, voce ذَا:] and most of the<br>\
leading authorities on inflection assert the same:<br>\
therefore, [though most persons would look for<br>\
them among words of which the last radical letter<br>\
is ت,] they are incorrectly placed in the K [and<br>\
in the S]. (MF.) Or ذَيْتَ is formed from ذَيْوٌ,<br>\
by eliding the و and doubling the ى and then<br>\
substituting for the teshdeed ت; and if you elide<br>\
the ت and replace it by ه, you must restore the<br>\
teshdeed, and say, كَانَ ذَيَّهْ وَذَيَّهْ. (S at the end<br>\
of art. ذو.)<br>\
