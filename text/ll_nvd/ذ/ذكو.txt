(K;) The fire blazed, or flamed; burned up; or<br>\
burned brightly or fiercely: (S:) or blazed, or<br>\
flamed, vehemently, or intensely: (K:) or blazed,<br>\
flamed, or burned up, completely; agreeably with<br>\
the primary signification of the root, which is<br>\
“ completeness. ” (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ذَكَا المِسْكُ The<br>\
mush gave forth odour, or fragrance; (MA;)<br>\
[or a strong, or pungent, odour; for] the primary<br>\
signification of ذَكًا in relation to odour is the<br>\
being strong, [or pungent,] in sweetness or in<br>\
fetidness. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ذَكِىَ, aor. يَذْكَى; (S, Msb,<br>\

يَذْكُو; (Msb;) and ذَكُوَ, (MA, K,) aor. يَذْكُو;<br>\
(K;) all three mentioned by ISd; (TA;) inf. n.<br>\
ذَكَآء; (S, MA, K, * TA; [in my copy of the Msb,<br>\
the inf. n. of the first is said to be ذَكًى; but this<br>\
is app. a mistranscription; or the author perhaps<br>\
held ذَكًى, more properly written ذَكًا, to be the<br>\
inf. n.; for he says that ذَكِىَ is of the class of<br>\
تَعِبَ, of which the inf. n. is تَعَبٌ, and afterwards<br>\
mentions ذَكَآءُ as though he held this to be a<br>\
simple subst.;]) said of a man, (S, Msb,) He<br>\
was, or became, sharp, or acute, in mind, (S,<br>\
TA,) with quickness of perception, and of intelligence, understanding, sagacity, skill, or knowledge: (TA:) or quick of understanding, (Msb,<br>\
K,) or intelligence, sagacity, skill, or knowledge:<br>\
(K:) or quick of perception, and sharp, or acute,<br>\
in understanding: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or quick in<br>\
drawing conclusions. (TA. [See ذَكَآءُ, below.])<br>\
[Also, app., said of a camel, and the like, meaning<br>\
He was, or became, sharp in spirit. See ذَكِىٌّ.]<br>\
-A2-  [ذَكَا seems to have been also used by some as<br>\
meaning He (a beast) was, or became, legalty<br>\
slaughtered; and consequently, legally clean: or<br>\
to have been supposed to have this signification.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] أَيُّمَا أَرْضٍ جَفَّتْ فَقَدْ ذَكَتْ means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Whatever ground has become dry, it has become<br>\
clean, or pure: but [Mtr, after mentioning this,<br>\
adds,] I have not found it in the lexicons. (Mgh.<br>\

2<br>\
ذكّى النَّارَ, (T, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَذْكِيَةٌ, (S,<br>\
TA,) He made the fire to blaze or flame, to burn<br>\
up, or to burn brightly or fiercely; (T, S, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ اذكاها: (S, K:) or he supplied the fire<br>\
fully with fuel: (Msb, TA:) and السِّرَاجَ ↓ اذكى<br>\
He lighted the lamp. (Har p. 53.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [ذكّى العَقْلَ,<br>\
and ذكّى alone, said of a medicine &amp;c., It sharpened the intellect.]<br>\
-A2-  ذكّى, (Mgh, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
as above, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) He slaughtered<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K) an animal, (Mgh,) or a camel<br>\
and the like, (Msb,) in the manner [prescribed by<br>\
the law,] termed ذَبْحٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) i. e., (Mgh,<br>\
K,) in the manner termed ذَكَاةٌ [q. v. infrà].<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K.) The proper signification of<br>\
التَّذْكِيَةُ is The causing the natural heat to pass<br>\
forth: but it is peculiarly applied in the law to<br>\
signify the destroying of life in a particular<br>\
manner, exclusive of any other manner. (Er-Rághib, TA.) إِلَّا مَا ذَكَّيْتُمْ, in the Kur [v. 4],<br>\
means Except that whereof ye shall attain to the<br>\
ذَكَاة [or slaughter in the manner prescribed by<br>\
the law] (Bd, Msb, TA) said of a man, (S,)<br>\
He became old, or advanced in age, (S, K,) and<br>\
big-bodied, or corpulent: (K:) [or he attained to<br>\
full growth or age: said of a man, and of a horse<br>\
and the like:] see ذَكَآءٌ, last sentence. [See also<br>\
مُذَكٍّ, below.])<br>\

أَذْكَوَ see 2, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] أَذْكَيْتُ<br>\
الحَرْبَ (assumed tropical:)  I kindled war. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَذْكَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
العُيُونَ I sent against him the scouts. (S.)<br>\

إِسْتَذْكَوَ see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,]<br>\
استذكى الفَحْلُ عَلَى الأُنْثَى (assumed tropical:)  The stallion pressed vehemently upon the female. (TA.)<br>\
ذَكًا an inf. n. of 1; The blazing, or flaming,<br>\
&amp;c., of fire. (S, K, &amp;c. [See 1, first sentence.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also ذُكْوَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  And see ذَكَاةٌ.<br>\
ذَكٍ a possessive epithet: (ISd, TA:) you say<br>\
نَارٌ ذَكِيَةٌ, (K, TA,) without teshdeed, (TA, [in<br>\
the CK ذَكِيَّةٌ,]) A fire blazing, or flaming, &amp;c.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
ذَكَاةٌ: see ذُكْوَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  [Also] a subst. (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA) syn. with تَذْكِيَةٌ (Mgh, Msb, K, TA)<br>\
as signifying ذَبْحٌ [i. e. The slaughter of an animal<br>\
for food in the manner prescribed by the law];<br>\
(Mgh, K, TA;) as also ↓ ذَكًا, (K, TA, [in the<br>\
CK ذَكاء,) which is likewise said to be a simple<br>\
subst.: (TA: [in the TK, ذَكًا and ذَكَاةٌ are both<br>\
said to be inf. ns., of which the verb is ذَكَا,<br>\
signifying ذَبَحَ; but this I do not find in any<br>\
lexicon of authority:]) it is satisfactorily performed by the severing of the windpipe and gullet,<br>\
as is related on the authority of Ahmad [Ibn-<br>\
Hambal], or, as is also related on his authority,<br>\
by severing them an also the وَدَجَانِ, [or two<br>\
external jugular veins], less than which is not<br>\
lawful; or, accord to A boo-Haneefeh, the severing<br>\
of the windpipe and gullet and one of the ودجان;<br>\
or, accord. to Málik, the severing of the أَوَدَاج [or<br>\
external jugular veins] though it be without the<br>\
severing of the windpipe. (Msb.) The saying<br>\
ذَكَاةُ الجَنِينِ ذَكَاةُ أُمِّهِ is for ذَكَاةُ الجَنِينِ هِىَ<br>\
ذَكَاةُ أُمِّهِ [The legal slaughter of the fœtus, or young<br>\
in the belly, it is the legal slaughter of its mother]:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) or it is an instance of the transposition of the inchoative and enunciative, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) its implied meaning being ذَكَاةُ أُمِّ الجَنِينِ<br>\
ذَكَاةٌ لَهُ [The legal slaughter of the mother of the<br>\
fœtus, or young in the belly, is a legal slaughter<br>\
of it also; so that the latter, like the former, may<br>\
be lawfully eaten]; (Msb;) i. e., when she is<br>\
legally slaughtered, it is legally slaughtered:<br>\
(TA:) the use of the accus. case (Mgh, TA) in<br>\
the like thereof, (Mgh,) [or] in the phrase ذكاة<br>\
امّه, [i. e., the saying ذَكَاةَ أُمِّهِ,] is a mistake.<br>\
(Mgh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the saying of Mohammad<br>\
Ibn-El-Hanafeeyeh, ذَكَاةُ الأَرْضِ يُبْسُهُا (assumed tropical:)  [The<br>\
cleanness, or purity, of the ground is its becoming<br>\
dry]; i. e., when it becomes dry from the moisture<br>\
of uncleanness, it becomes clean, like as a beast<br>\
becomes clean by means of legal slaughter. (Mgh.<br>\
[See also 1, last sentence.])<br>\
ذُكْوَةٌ, (T, TA, &amp;c.,) with damm, not ذَكْوَةٌ as<br>\
the text of the K indicates it to be (TA) [and as<br>\
it is written in the copies thereof], and ذُكْيَةٌ,<br>\
(S, TA,) also with damm, (TA,) [in the copies of<br>\
the K ذَكْيَة,] What is thrown upon the fire,<br>\
(T, S, K, *) of firewood, or of camel&#39;s or similar<br>\
dung, (T,) to make it blaze, or flame, or burn<br>\
up, or burn brightly or fiercely. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
the former, A blazing, or flaming, coal of fire;<br>\
and so ↓ ذَكًا, (K, TA,) with the short ا, on the<br>\
authority of IDrd; [in the CK ذَكَاء;] or, as in<br>\
the M, ↓ ذَكَاةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
ذَكْوَانٌ A kind of trees: n. un. with ة: (IAar,<br>\
TA:) the pl. of the latter is ذَكَاوِينُ, and signifies small [trees of the kind called] سَرْح [q. v.].<br>\
(M, K, TA. [In the CK, السَّرْج is erroneously<br>\
put for السَّرْح.])<br>\
ذَكَآءُ Sharpness, or acuteness, of mind, (S,<br>\
Msb, TA,) with quickness of perception, and of<br>\
intelligence, understanding, sagacity, skill, or<br>\
knowledge: (TA:) or completeness of intelligence, with quickness of apprehension: (Msb:)<br>\
or quickness of intelligence, understanding, sagacity, skill, or knowledge: (K:) or quickness of<br>\
perception, and sharpness, or acuteness, of understanding: thus applied, it is like the phrase<br>\
فُلَانٌ شُعْلَةُ نَارٍ: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or quickness<br>\
in drawing conclusions. (TA. [See ذِهْنٌ: and<br>\
see also 1.]) [It app. signifies also Sharpness of<br>\
spirit; as a quality of a camel and the like.<br>\
See ذَكِىٌّ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Age: (S, K:) or full, or<br>\
complete, age: so says Mbr in the “ Kámil: ”<br>\
(TA:) contr. of فَتَآءٌ: (Ham p. 217:) accord. to<br>\
Az, its primary signification, universally, is a<br>\
state of completeness: and الذَّكَآءُ فِى السِّنّ means<br>\
completeness of age: accord. to Kh, it means the<br>\
age of completeness of strength, [app. in a horse,<br>\
or any solid-hoofed animal, for he says that it is]<br>\
when a year has passed after the قُرُوح [or<br>\
finishing of teething]: (TA:) or ذَكَآءُ السِّنِّ<br>\
means the utmost term of youthfulness; from the<br>\
primary signification of the root, which is “ a<br>\
state of completeness. ” (Mgh.) Hence the saying<br>\
of El-Hajjáj, فُرِرْتُ عَنْ ذَكَآءٍ [I have been examined as to age; app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  my abilities<br>\
have been tested and proved]: and بَلَغَتِ الدَّابَّةُ<br>\
الذَّكَآءَ The beast attained to [fulness of] age<br>\
(S, TA.) [Hence, also,] one says, فَتَآ فُلَانٍ<br>\
كَذَكَآءِ فُلَانٍ and فُلَانٍ ↓ كَتَذْكِيَةِ [The youthfulness of such a one is like the fulness of age of<br>\
such a one], i. e., the prudence, or discretion, of<br>\
such a one notwithstanding his deficiency of age<br>\
is like the prudence, or discretion, of such a one<br>\
with his fulness of age. (Ham p. 217.)<br>\
ذُكَآءُ, imperfectly decl., The sun: (S, K:)<br>\
determinate, and not admitting the article ال:<br>\
you say, هٰذِهِ ذُكَآءُ طَالِعَةٌ [This is the sun rising]:<br>\
(S:) derived from ذَكَتِ النَّارُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
(S,) اِبْنُ ذُكَآءَ The dawn, or daybreak: (S, K:)<br>\
because it is from the light of the sun. (S.)<br>\
Homeyd says, [or, accord. to some, Besheer<br>\
Ibn-En-Nikth, as in one of my copies of the S,<br>\
in art. كفر,]<br>\
فَوَرَدَتْ قَبْلَ انْبِلَاجِ الفَجْرِ<br>\
وَابْنُ ذُكَآءَ كَامِنٌ فِى الكَفْرِ<br>\
[And she, or they, came to the water before the<br>\
bright shining of the daybreak, while the dawn<br>\
lay kid in the darkness of night]. (S.)<br>\
ذَكِىٌّ, applied to musk, and so ذَكِيَّةٌ, (K, TA,)<br>\
for مِسْكٌ, as is said by IAmb, is both masc. and<br>\
fem., and so is عَنْبَرٌ, (TA,) and ↓ ذَاكٍ, Diffusing<br>\
odour: (K:) or having a strong [or pungent]<br>\
odour. (TA. [See 1, second sentence.]) You<br>\
say also رَائِحَةٌ ذَكِيَّةٌ A sharp [or pungent, or a<br>\
strong,] odour [whether sweet or fetid]; syn. حَادَّةٌ.<br>\
(K in art. حد.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to a man, Having<br>\
the attribute, or quality, termed ذَكَآء, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) as meaning sharpness, or acuteness, (S, Msb,)<br>\
or quickness, (K,) of mind, (S, Msb,) or of intel-ligence, &amp;c.: (K, TA, &amp;c.:) pl. أَذْكِيَآءُ. (Msb,<br>\
TA.) It is also, sometimes, applied to a camel<br>\
[or the like, as meaning Sharp in spirit: see<br>\
فُؤَادٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. ذَبِيحٌ [meaning<br>\
Slaughtered in the manner prescribed by the<br>\
law, termed ذَبْحٌ and ذَكَاةٌ]: (K:) it is of the<br>\
measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) and [therefore] you say شَاةٌ ذَكِىٌّ, meaning [a sheep, or goat, slaughtered in the manner<br>\
above mentioned; and also,] to whose ذَكَاة [or<br>\
slaughter in that manner] one has attained<br>\
[while life yet remained therein: see 2]: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) ذَكِيَّةٌ [as its fem.] is extr. [like ذَبِيحَةٌ].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, جِلْدٌ ذَكِىٌّ (tropical:)  A skin stripped<br>\
from an animal that has been slaughtered in the<br>\
manner mentioned above. (Mgh.)<br>\
ذَاكٍ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مُذْكٍ; and the fem., مُذْكِيَةٌ: see the following<br>\
paragraph, in three places.<br>\
مُذَكٍّ, applied to a man, (TA,) Old, or advanced<br>\
in age, and big-bodied, or corpulent: (K, TA:)<br>\
[or full-grown, or of full age: see ذَكَآءٌ:] or an<br>\
old man, but only such as is much experienced<br>\
and disciplined: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and accord.<br>\
to ISd, anything [i. e. any animal] old, or advanced in age: by some especially applied to a<br>\
solid-hoofed animal; and said to mean one that<br>\
has passed the قُرُوح [or finishing of teething] by<br>\
a year: (TA:) or مَذَاكٍ, (S, K, TA,) which is<br>\
its pl., (S, TA,) [(like as مُذَكِّيَاتٌ is pl. of the<br>\
fem.,) and also pl. of its syn. ↓ مُذْكٍ,] signifies,<br>\
applied to horses, (S, K, TA,) of generous race,<br>\
advanced in age, (TA,) that have passed a year,<br>\
or two years, after their قُرُوح: (S, K, TA:) the<br>\
sing. is like مُخْلِفٌ applied to a camel: (S, TA:)<br>\
or مُذَكٍّ signifies a horse of full age and of complete strength; as also ↓ مُذْكٍ: (Ham p. 217:)<br>\
or a horse whose run becomes spent (يَذْهِبُ), and<br>\
[then, but not before he has exhausted his power,]<br>\
stops. (TA.) It is said in a prov., جَرْىُ<br>\
المُذَكِّيَاتُ غِلَابٌ [The running of the horses that<br>\
have attained to their full age and strength is a<br>\
contending for superiority]: (Meyd, and so in<br>\
some copies of the S:) it may mean that the<br>\
horse in this case contends for superiority with<br>\
him that runs with him; or that his second run<br>\
is always more than his first, and his third than<br>\
his second: (Meyd:) or, as some relate it, غِلَآءٌ;<br>\
(Meyd, and so in other copies of the S in this<br>\
art., and in the S and K in art غلو;) meaning<br>\
that the running of such horses is several bowshots: (Meyd, and S and K in art. غلو:) it is<br>\
applied to him who is described as entering into<br>\
contests for excellence with his compeers. (Meyd.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ↓ سَحَابَةٌ مُذْكِيَةٌ, (K,) or, as in the<br>\
Tekmileh, مُذَكِّيَةٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  A cloud that has<br>\
rained time after time. (K, TA.)<br>\
