↓ ذَفْرَآءٌ A certain herb, or leguminous plant, (K,)<br>\

of أَذْفَرُ:] a certain herb, of foul odour, which<br>\
camels &amp;c. scarcely ever eat: (Yaakoob, S:) or a<br>\
certain tree, also called عِطْرُ لأَمَةِ: or, accord. to<br>\
AHn, a species of [the trees called] حَمْض: or, as<br>\
he says in another place, a certain green herb,<br>\
which rises a span high, with round leaves, and<br>\
with branches, having no flower; the odour of<br>\
which is like that of a slight wind from the anus:<br>\
it makes the breath of camels to stink; and they<br>\
desire it eagerly: it is bitter; and grows in rugged<br>\
places: and Abu-n-Nejm describes it as in meadows. (TA.) [Ruta sylvestris. (Golius, from<br>\
Er-Rázee.)]<br>\
ذَفرَةٌ A single emission of pungent, or strong,<br>\
odour. (Msb.)<br>\
ذُفْرَةٌ: see ذَفَرٌ.<br>\
ذَفَرَةٌ: see ذَفَرٌ.<br>\

alif [written ى] is the characteristic of the fem.<br>\
gender, (S,) and sometimes, (S, K,) more rarely,<br>\
(Sb,) ذِفْرًى, with tenween, (S, K,) when indeterminate, (S,) the alif in this case being considered<br>\
as making the word quasi-coordinate to دِرْهَمٌ<br>\
(S, K,) The place that sweats, in the back of a<br>\
camel&#39;s neck, behind the ear: (Lth, S:) or, in a<br>\
man, (M,) and in any animal, the part extending<br>\
from the مَقَدّ [or part between the two ears,<br>\
erroneously written in the CK مُقَدَّم,] to the half<br>\
of the قَذَال [or entire back of the head]: or the<br>\
prominent bone behind the ear: (M, K:) or a<br>\
bone in the upper part of a man&#39;s neck, on the<br>\
right and left of the small hollow which is in the<br>\
middle: (Sh:) or the ذِفْرَيَانِ [which is the dual]<br>\
are the two protuberances on the right and left of<br>\
the small hollow in the middle of the back of the<br>\
neck: (M:) it is from ذَفَرُ العَرَقِ [“ the pungency of<br>\
the odour of sweat ”], because it is the first part<br>\
that sweats in a camel: (S:) pl. ذِفْرَيَاتٌ and<br>\
ذَفَارَى, (S, K,) and some say ذَفَارٍ. (S.)<br>\
ذِفَرٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
ذِفْرَى A camel large in the part called ة:<br>\
fem. with ة: (AZ, S, K:) or a great camel:<br>\
(AA:) or (so in the TA; but in the K, “and ”)<br>\
hard, or firm, and strong: as also ↓ ذِفَرٌّ: (K:)<br>\
but the former (ذِفِرٌّ) is of higher authority: also<br>\
applied to a camel; fem. with ة: and in like<br>\
manner to an ass: (TA:) or (so in the TA; but<br>\
in the K, “and ”) great in make: (K:) also a<br>\
young man tall, perfect [in make], and hardy,<br>\
strong, or sturdy: (S, K:) and ذِفِرَّةٌ an excellent<br>\
she-camel, (K,) long-necked: (TA:) and, accord.<br>\
to the K, a bulky, or thick, ass: but this is at<br>\
variance with what is found in other lexicons.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
أَذْفَرُ and ذَفْرَآءُ: see ذَفِرٌ, in eight places.<br>\
رَوْضَةٌ مَذْفُورَةٌ A meadow abounding with ذَفْرَآء.<br>\
