ذَلَّ, aor. يَذِلُّ, (M, Msb, K,) inf. n. ذُلٌّ and<br>\
ذِلَّةٌ and مَذَلَّةٌ, (S, * M, MA, K,) or these three<br>\
are simple substs., and the inf. n. is ذَلٌّ, (Msb,)<br>\
and ذَلَالَةٌ (M, K) and ذُلَالَةٌ, (K,) [contr. of عَزَّ;<br>\
(see ذُلٌّ below;) i. e.] He, or it, was or became,<br>\
low, base, vile, abject, mean, paltry, contemptible,<br>\
despicable, ignominious, inglorious, abased, humble,<br>\
and weak; (MA, Msb, K;) syn. هَانَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\

(M, Msb,) aor. as above, (M, K,) inf. n. ذِلٌّ,<br>\
(M, Msb, K,) said of a man, (M,) and of a beast,<br>\
such as a horse and the like, (دَابَّة, M, Msb,) He,<br>\
or it, was, or became, easy, tractable, submissive,<br>\
or manageable; (M, Msb, K;) and اِذْلَوْلَى [which<br>\
belongs to art. ذلى] signifies the same as ذَلَّ in<br>\
this sense. (ISd, TA.) And لَهُ ↓ تذلّل He<br>\
became lowly, humble, or submissive, [or he<br>\
lowered, humbled, or submitted, himself,] to him;<br>\
(S, TA;) as also تَذَلَّى, originally تَذَلَّلَ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] ذَلَّ is also said of a road [as meaning (assumed tropical:)  It was, or became, beaten, or trodden, so as<br>\
to be rendered even, or easy to be travelled, or to<br>\
walk or ride upon: see ذَلِيلٌ]. (A in art. تب.)<br>\

watering-trough or tank, (TA,) or of the upper<br>\
part thereof, (M,) (assumed tropical:)  It was, or became, broken<br>\
much, or in several places, in its edge, and much<br>\
demolished. (M, TA.)<br>\

ذلّل, (M, Msb,) inf. n. تَذْلِيلٌ, (Msb,) He<br>\
made, or rendered, (M, Msb,) a man, (M,) and<br>\
a beast, such as a horse and the like, (M, Msb,)<br>\
easy, tractable, submissive, or manageable: (M,<br>\
Msb:) [said of the former, it may be rendered<br>\
he brought under, or into, subjection; or he<br>\
subdued: and said of the latter, he broke, or<br>\
trained: and said of any animal, he tamed. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, (assumed tropical:)  He beat, or trod, a road, so as to render<br>\
it even, or easy to be travelled, or to walk or ride<br>\
upon: see ذَلِيلٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And ذلّل لَهُ أَمْرًا (assumed tropical:)  He made<br>\
an affair easy to him; syn. رَوَّضَهُ and سَوَّسَهُ.<br>\
(TA in art. سوس.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And ذِلِّلَ الكَرْمُ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
bunches of the grape-vine were made to hang<br>\
down [so that they might be easily plucked]:<br>\
(M, K:) or were evenly disposed [for the same<br>\
purpose]; syn. سُوِّيَتْ: (K:) or, accord. to AHn,<br>\
التَّذْلِيلُ signifies the disposing evenly the bunches<br>\
of the grape-vine, and making them to hang down.<br>\
(M.) وَذُلِّلَتْ قُطُوفُهَا, in the Kur [lxxvi. 14], means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The bunches being evenly disposed, and made to<br>\
hang down, (S, JM,) exposed to be plucked:<br>\
(JM:) or being well disposed, and made near:<br>\
(IAmb, TA:) or being within the reach of the<br>\
seeker, or desirer: (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, TA:) or being<br>\
easy to reach by those who will pluck them, in<br>\
whatever manner they may desire to do so: (Bd:)<br>\
accord. to Mujáhid, it means that if one stand,<br>\
the bunch will rise to him; and if one sit, it will<br>\
hang down to him. (TA.) [In like manner,]<br>\
التَّذْلِيلُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The putting the raceme of<br>\
the palm-tree upon the branch [near it] in order<br>\
that it [the branch] may support it: (AHn, M:)<br>\
or تَذْلِيلُ العُذُوقِ, as practised in the present<br>\
world, is (assumed tropical:)  the trimmer&#39;s making straight, and<br>\
fecundating before the usual time, the racemes of<br>\
the palm-tree, when they come forth from their<br>\
spathes that covered them, these having slit open<br>\
and disclosed them, by which means one makes<br>\
them to hang out from among the branches and<br>\
prickles, so that the fruit is easily plucked when<br>\
it ripens. (T. [See also مُذَلَّلٌ.]) [Hence it is<br>\
said in the K that ذُلِّلَ النَّخْلُ signifies وُضِعَ<br>\
عِذْقُهَا عَلَى الجَرِيدَةِ لِتَحْمِلَهُ: the explanation<br>\
should be وُضِعَتْ عُذُوقُهَا عَلَى الجَرِيدِ لِتَحْمِلَهَا, i. e.<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The palm-trees had their racemes put upon the<br>\
branches in order that these might support them.]<br>\

(God, Msb) lowered, abased, or humbled, him;<br>\
or rendered him low, base, vile, abject, mean,<br>\

K, TA;) as also ↓ ذللّٰهُ and ↓ استذلّهُ: (K, TA:)<br>\
all these signify the same. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 10<br>\
-A2-  اذلّ [as an intrans. verb] He (a man, S, M)<br>\
became one whose companions were low, base, vile,<br>\
&amp;c. (S, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He became in a state, or<br>\
condition, that was low, base, vile, &amp;c. (S in art.<br>\
قهر.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَذَلَّ3َ see 1.<br>\
10<br>\
استذلّهُ He saw him to be ذَلِيل [i. e. low,<br>\
base, vile, &amp;c.]: (M, K:) or he found him to be<br>\
so; (TA;) as also ↓ اذّلهُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 4. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
استذلّ البَعِيرَ الصَّعْبَ He plucked off the ticks<br>\
from the refractory camel in order that he might<br>\
experience pleasure [or relief], and so become at<br>\
ease, or tranquil, (M, K,) with him. (K.)<br>\
[<br>\
اذْلَوْلَى, a verb of which one of the significations<br>\
is mentioned in this art. in the K, belongs to<br>\
art. ذلى.]<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَذَلْذَلَ [app. from ذُلْذُلٌ] It was, or<br>\
became, in a state of commotion, or agitation, and<br>\
lax, slack, or pendulous. (K.)<br>\
ذُلٌّ and ↓ ذِلَّةٌ and ↓ مَذَلَّةٌ [all mentioned in the<br>\
M and MA and K as inf. ns.] contr. of عِزٌّ; (S,<br>\
M;) [i. e.] Lowness, baseness, vileness, abjectness,<br>\
meanness, paltriness, contemptibleness, despicableness, ignominiousness, ingloriousness, abasement,<br>\
humiliation, and weakness. (Msb, K. *) وَ لَمْ يَكُنْ<br>\
لَهُ وَلِىٌّ مِنَ الذُّلِّ, in the Kur [xvii. last verse],<br>\
means Nor hath taken to himself any aider to<br>\
assist Him and league with Him by reason of any<br>\
lowness of condition in Him, as is the custom of<br>\
the Arabs to do: (K, TA: [in the CK, يُخالِفُهُ is<br>\
erroneously put for يُحَالِفُهُ:]) for they used to<br>\
league, one with another, seeking thereby to<br>\
become strong and inaccessible. (TA.) See also<br>\
ذَلِيلٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  And see the paragraph here following,<br>\
in five places.<br>\
ذِلٌّ Easiness, tractableness, submissiveness, or<br>\
manageableness; (S, M, K, and Ham p. 50;<br>\
[mentioned in the M and Msb and K as an<br>\
inf. n.;]) as also ↓ ذُلٌّ. (M, K, and Ham ubi<br>\
suprà.) Hence the saying, بَعْضُ الذِّلِّ أَبْقَى لِلْأَهْلِ<br>\
وَالمَالِ [Somewhat of submissiveness is most<br>\
preservative of the family and the property]:<br>\
(S:) or أَبْقَى لِلْأَهْلِ وَالمَالِ ↓ الذُّلُّ, occurring in a<br>\
trad. of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr; meaning that abjectness<br>\
betiding a man when he bears patiently an injury<br>\
that has befallen him is most preservative of him<br>\
and of his family and his property. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also Gentleness; and mercy; and so ↓ ذُلٌّ: thus in<br>\
the phrase, ↓ وَاخْفِضْ لَهُمَا جَنَاحَ الذُّلِّ or الذِّلِّ,<br>\
(M, K,) in the Kur [xvii. 25, lit. And make soft<br>\
to them (thy two parents) the side of gentleness;<br>\
meaning treat them with gentleness]: the former<br>\
is the common reading: (TA:) or the latter<br>\
means easiness, tractableness, or submissiveness:<br>\
(K:) [and so the former, as has been stated above:]<br>\
Er-Rághib says that ↓ الذُّلُّ is a consequence of<br>\
subjection; and الذِّلُّ is what is after refractoriness:<br>\
so that the phrase means, [accord. to the former<br>\
reading,] be gentle like him who is subjected to<br>\
them; and accord. to the latter reading, be gentle<br>\
and tractable, or submissive, to them. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also The beaten track, (K,) or part that is trodden<br>\
and made even, (M,) of a road. (M, K.) Its pl.<br>\
أَذْلَال occurs in the saying, أَجْرِ الأُمُورَعَلَى أَذْلَالِهَا<br>\
Let events, or affairs, take their course in the<br>\
ways, or manners, that are fit, or proper, for<br>\
them, and easy. (T.) El-Khansà says,<br>\
لِتَجْرِ المَنِيَّةِ بَعْدَ الفَتَى الْمُغَادَرِ بِالْمَحْوِ أَذْلَالَهَا<br>\
[Let fate take its ways after the youth left behind<br>\
in El-Mahw]; (S, M;) meaning I mourn not<br>\
for any thing after him: cited by AA: (S in the<br>\
present art. and in art. محو:) المحو is here the<br>\
name of a place. (S in the latter art.) And one<br>\
says, أُمُورُ اللّٰهِ جَارِيَةُ عَلَى أَذْلَالِهَا, (S, M, K,) and<br>\
جَارِيَةٌ أَذْلَالَهَا, (M, K,) The decrees of God take<br>\
their [appointed] courses: (S, M, K:) here, also,<br>\
اذلال is pl. of ذِلٌّ. (M, K.) And ↓ دَعْهُ عَلَى أَذْلَالِهِ<br>\
Leave thou him, or it, in his, or its, [present]<br>\
state, or condition: (S, M, K:) in this case it<br>\
has no sing. (M, K.) [And so in the saying,]<br>\
↓ جَآءَ عَلَى أَذْلَالِهِ It came in its [proper] manner.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also another usage of أَذْلَال, as a<br>\
pl. having no sing. assigned to it, voce ذُلْذُلٌ,<br>\
last sentence.<br>\

-b2-  In the following verse,<br>\
لِيَهْنِئْ تُرَاثِى لِامْرِئٍ غَيْرِ ذِلَّةٍ<br>\
صَنَابِرُ أُحْدَانٌ لِهُنَّ حَفِيفُ<br>\
[May my heritage give joy to a man not low, or<br>\
base; slender arrows, singular of their kind,<br>\
that have a whizzing sound], the meaning is,<br>\
غَيْرِ ذَلِيلٍ, or غَيْرِ ذِى ذِلَّةٍ; and صنابر is put in the<br>\
nom. case as a substitute for تراث. (M.)<br>\
ذَلُولٌ Easy, tractable, submissive, or manageable;<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K;) applied to a beast, such as a<br>\
horse and the like, (دَابَّة), (S, M, Msb,) and to a<br>\
man [&amp;c.]; (M;) and so ↓ ذَلُولِىٌّ, applied to a<br>\
man: (TA, as from the M: [but not found by me<br>\
in the latter; and I believe that the right reading<br>\
is ذَلَوْلًى, belonging to art. ذلى, q. v.:]) the<br>\
former alike masc. and fem.: (M, TA:) pl. ذُلُلٌ<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K) and أَذِلَّةٌ. (K.) A poet applies<br>\
the epithet ذُلُل to spear-heads, as meaning Made<br>\
easy [to pierce with] by being sharpened, and<br>\
made thin and slender. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next<br>\
paragraph, in two places.<br>\
ذَلِيلٌ Low, base, vile, abject, mean, paltry,<br>\

Msb, K) and ذِلَالٌ. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also Gentle;<br>\
and merciful. Hence,] أَذِلَّةٍ عَلَى المُؤْمِنِينَ أَعِزَّةٍ<br>\
عَلَى الكَافِرينَ, in the Kur [v. 59], means Gentle,<br>\
(Zj, T,) and merciful, (T,) to the believers, rough<br>\
in behaviour, (Zj, T,) and hard, or severe, (T,) to<br>\
the unbelievers. (Zj, T.) ―<br>\

M:) and [in like manner] ↓ مُذَلَّلٌ, so applied,<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  short, applied to a spear. (T.) ―<br>\
-b5-  You say also<br>\
ذَلِيلٌ ↓ ذُلٌّ, [meaning Exceeding lowness or baseness &amp;c.; or lowering, or abasing, lowness or baseness &amp;c.; i. e.,] using the latter word as an<br>\
intensive epithet; or as signifying مُذِلٌّ. (M, K.)<br>\
ذَلُولِىٌّ Good and easy in respect of natural<br>\
disposition: pl. ذَلُولِيُّونَ. (Ibn-&#39; Abbád, K. [In<br>\
the CK, الخَلْقِ is erroneously put for الخُلُقِ.])<br>\
See also ذَلُولٌ.<br>\

and ↓ ذِلْذِلَةٌ, also; and they are also called ذَنَاذِنُ,<br>\
pl. of ذِنْذِنٌ; (T;) and دَنَادِنُ: (K in art. دن:)<br>\

rather] this last is pl. of all the foregoing words;<br>\
(M;) and ↓ ذَلَذِلُ and ↓ ذَلَذِلَةٌ [in some copies<br>\
of the K, erroneously, ذَلْذَل, or ذَلْذُل, and ذَلْذَلَة,]<br>\
signify the same; (K;) [or rather] the former of<br>\
these two is a contraction of the pl. ذَلَاذِلُ (S, M)<br>\
[and the latter of them is the same contracted pl.<br>\
with the addition of ة]. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ذَلَاذِلُ النَّاسِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Those who are the last of the people; (K;) or<br>\
the last of a few of the people; so in the Moheet;<br>\

-b2-  Also, [applied to palmtrees (نَخْل),] (assumed tropical:)  Having the fruit thereof bent<br>\
[down] in order that it may be [easily] gathered:<br>\
[see also its verb (2):] so in the following verse<br>\

وَسَاقٍ كَأُنْبُوبِ السَّقِىِّ المُذَلَّلِ<br>\
meaning And a waist slender like the camel&#39;s<br>\
nose-rein of [twisted] leather, thin; and a shank<br>\
resembling, in the clearness of its colour, the<br>\

(بَرْدِىّ) growing among irrigated palm-trees<br>\
having their racemes bent down (ذُلِّلَتْ) by reason<br>\
of the abundance of their fruit; so that their<br>\
branches overshade these papyrus-plants: or,<br>\
accord. to some, and a shank resembling the stalk<br>\
of the irrigated papyrus that is bent down (مُذَلَّل)<br>\
by saturation: (EM pp. 28 and 29:) As says that<br>\
it means, [agreeably with the former explanation,]<br>\
سَاقٍ كَأُنْبُوبِ بَرْدِىٍّ بَيْنَ هٰذَا النَّخْلِ المُذَّلَلِ: AO<br>\
says that سَقِىّ means watered [naturally,] without<br>\
occasioning one&#39;s taking any trouble to water:<br>\
IAar explained المُذَلَّل as meaning having the<br>\
way of the water thereto made easy: and some<br>\
say that by السَّقِىّ is meant the tender, white,<br>\
stalk of the بَرْدِىّ. (T.)<br>\
