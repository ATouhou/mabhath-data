ذ<br>\
The ninth letter of the alphabet; called ذَالٌ:<br>\
it is one of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة [or vocal,<br>\
i. e. pronounced with the voice, and not with the<br>\
breath only]: and of the letters termed لِثَوِيَّة [or<br>\
gingival], which are ث and ذ and ظ; wherefore<br>\
it is substituted for ث in تَلَعْذَمَ for تَلَعْثَمَ; and it<br>\
is said to be substituted for the unpointed د in<br>\
فَشَرِّذْ بِهِمْ, [as some read] in the Kur [viii. 59,<br>\
for فَشَرِّدْ بهم]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [As a numeral, it denotes<br>\
Seven hundred.]<br>\
