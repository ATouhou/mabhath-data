signifies (assumed tropical:)  he hastened, made haste, or sped; syn.<br>\
أَسْرَعَ: (M:) [and, accord. to Et-Tebreezee, this<br>\

primary meaning is الإِسْرَاعُ. (Ham p. 207.) And<br>\

suspended in the air: (S, M:) and ↓ تَذَبْذُبٌ the<br>\
being in a state of motion or commotion: (S, L:)<br>\
[or the latter has both these meanings; for] you<br>\
say, الشَّىْءُ ↓ تَذَبْذَبَ the thing dangled, or moved<br>\
to and fro, (M, A, L,) in the air; (A;) and<br>\
was in a state of commotion or agitation. (M, L.)<br>\

تَذَبْذَبَ, inf. n. تَذَبْذُبٌ: see the next<br>\
preceding paragraph, in four places.<br>\
ذَبٌّ Repelling: fem. with ة: hence ذَبَّاتُ<br>\
السَّبِيبِ, a phrase used by Dhu-r-Rummeh, meaning repelling with their tails: or this may be<br>\
from the signification next following. (Ham<br>\
p. 510.)<br>\
-A2-  Much in motion. (Ham ubi suprà.)<br>\
ذَبٌّ, (M, L,) or ↓ ذَابٌّ, (K,) [the former correct,<br>\
and perhaps the latter also,] applied to a camel,<br>\
That does not, or will not, remain still, or motionless, in a place. (M, L, K.) A poet says,<br>\
فَكَأَنَّنَا فِيهِمْ جِمَالٌ ذَبَّةٌ<br>\
[And it was as though we were, among them,<br>\
camels that would not remain still in a place]:<br>\
which shows that ذَبٌّ is not an inf. n. used as an<br>\
epithet; for, were it so, he had said جِمَالٌ ذَبٌّ.<br>\
(M, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الذَّبُّ (tropical:)  The wild bull; [a species of<br>\
bovine antelope;] also called ذَبُّ الرِّيَادِ; (T, S,<br>\
M, K;) so called because he goes to and fro, not<br>\
remaining in one place; (M;) or because he<br>\
pastures going to and fro; (T, S, * M;) or because<br>\
his females pasture with him, going to and fro:<br>\
(T:) and called also ↓ الأَذَبُّ, (T, K,) by poetic<br>\
license, for الذَّبُّ; (T;) and ↓ الذُّنْبُبُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
ذَبُّ الرِّيَادِ is also applied to (tropical:)  A man who goes and<br>\
comes. (Kr, M, TA.) And (tropical:)  A man who is in<br>\
the habit of visiting women. (AA, T, K.)<br>\
ذُبَابٌ [The common fly;] the black thing that<br>\
is in houses, that falls into the vessel and into<br>\
food; (M;) well known: (S, K:) so called,<br>\
accord. to Ed-Demeeree, because of its fluttering<br>\
about, or because it returns as often as it is driven<br>\
away: (TA:) and likewise applied to the bee;<br>\
(M, K;) which is also called ذُبَابُ الغَيْثِ [the fly<br>\
of the rain], (IAth, TA,) or ذُبَابُ غَيْثٍ [the fly<br>\
of rain]; because the rain is the means of producing herbage, and by herbage it is fed; (Mgh;)<br>\
or because it accompanies rain, and lives upon<br>\
that which the rain causes to grow: (IAth, TA:)<br>\
[accord. to some, it is a coll. gen. n.; and] the n.<br>\
un. is ↓ ذُبَابَةٌ: (S, Msb, K:) one should not say<br>\
ذِبَّانَةٌ [as the vulgar do in the present day]: (S:)<br>\
or one should not say ↓ ذُبَابَةٌ, though El-Ahmar<br>\
and Ks are related to have used this word [as<br>\
meaning a kind of fly]; for ذُبَابٌ is a sing. [properly speaking], and is used as such in the Kur<br>\
xxii. 72: (M:) the pl. (of pauc., S, Msb) is<br>\
أَذِبَّهٌ and (of mult., S, Msb) ذِبَّانٌ (S, M, Msb, K)<br>\
and ذُبٌّ, (M, K,) the last mentioned by Sb,<br>\
accord. to the dial. of Temeem. (M.) One says,<br>\
إِنَّهُ لَأَوْهَى مِنَ الذُّبَابِ [Verily he is more frail<br>\
than the fly]. (A.) And هُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَىَّ مِنْ طَنِينِ<br>\
الذُّبَابِ [He is more contemptible to me than the<br>\
buzzing of the fly]. (A.) مَنْجَى الذُّبَابِ [The<br>\
refuge of the fly] is a prov., applied to him who<br>\
is protected by his ignobleness. (Har p. 332:<br>\
there written مَنْجَا; and in two places, منجأ.)<br>\
And أَبُو الذُّبَابِ [The father of the fly] is an<br>\
appellation used as meaning (assumed tropical:)  He who has stinking breath; and some say أَبُو الذِّبَّانِ [the father<br>\
of the flies]: (M, TA:) and is especially applied<br>\
to &#39;Abd-El-Melik Ibn-Marwán: (M, A, TA:)<br>\
whence the saying, أَبْخَرُ مِنْ أَبِى الذُّبَابِ (A, TA)<br>\
and أَبِى الذِّبَّانِ (TA) [More stinking in breath<br>\
than Abu-dh-Dhubáb and Abu-dh-Dhibbán]. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] (tropical:)  Evil, or mischief; (A, K;) and annoyance, or harm; as in the saying, أَصَابَنِى ذُبَابٌ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Evil, &amp;c., befell me]; (A;) and أَصَابَ فُلَانًا مِنْ<br>\
فُلَانٍ ذُبَابٌ لَاذِعٌ (assumed tropical:)  Evil, or mischief, [lit. a hurting<br>\
fly] fell upon such a one from such a one: (T:)<br>\
or (tropical:)  continual evil, as in the saying, أَصَابَكَ ذُبَابٌ<br>\
مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ (tropical:)  [Continual evil hath befallen thee<br>\
from this thing, or event]; and شَرُّهَا ذُبَابٌ (tropical:)  [Her,<br>\
or its, or their, evil is a continual evil]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  Ill luck. (T, K.) Fr relates that the Prophet<br>\
saw a man with long hair; and said ذُبَابٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  This is ill luck: and hence, ↓ رَجُلٌ ذُبَابِىٌّ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [An unlucky man]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  Plague, or pestilence. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  Diabolical possession; or madness, or insanity. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  (assumed tropical:)  Ignorance: so in<br>\
the phrase رَجُلٌ مَحْشِىٌّ الذُّبَابِ (assumed tropical:)  [A man stuffed<br>\
with ignorance]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b7-  (tropical:)  The إِنْسَان [as meaning the pupil, or apple,] of the eye: (AZ, T, S,<br>\

ذُبَابِ العَيْنِ (tropical:)  [He is dearer to me than the apple<br>\
of the eye]: (A:) [ISd says,] I think it to be so<br>\
termed as being likened to the ذُبَاب [properly so<br>\
called; i.e. the fly]. (M.) And الذُّبَابُ also<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  A black speck, or spot, in the interior<br>\
of the حَدَقَة [or dark part] of the eye of the<br>\
horse. (M, K.) The pl. is as above. (M.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
ذُبَابُ السَّيْفِ (T, S, M, A, Msb, K) and ↓ ذُبَابَةٌ<br>\
السَّيْفِ (TA) (tropical:)  The حَدّ, (M, K,) or طَرَف, (S,<br>\
Msb,) [each app. here meaning the point, or<br>\
extremity, though the former also means the<br>\
edge,] of the sword, (S, M, Msb, K,) which is the<br>\
part wherewith one strikes: (S, Msb:) or its<br>\
extremity with which one is pierced, or transpierced; and the حَدّ [here meaning edge] with<br>\
which one strikes is called its غِرَار: (En-Nadr, T:)<br>\
or its tapering, or pointed, extremity; expl. by<br>\
طَرَفُهُ المُتَطَرِّفُ: (M, K:) or the point (حَدّ) of its<br>\
extremity (M, A) which is between its شَفْرَتَانِ:<br>\
(M:) the parts of its two edges that are on either<br>\
side of it are its ظُبَتَانِ: the ridge in the middle<br>\
of it, on the inner and outer sides, is called the عَيْر;<br>\
and each has what are termed غِرَارَانِ, which are the<br>\
part between the عَيْر and each one of the ظُبَتَانِ<br>\
on the outer side of the sword and the corresponding portion of the inner side, each of the غِرَارَانِ<br>\
being on the inner side of the sword and its outer<br>\
side. (AZ, T, TA.) [The swords of the Arabs,<br>\
in the older times, were generally straight, twoedged, and tapering to a point; and so are many<br>\
of them in the present day; a little wider towards<br>\
the point than towards the hilt.] Hence the<br>\
saying, ثَمَرَةُ السَّوْطِ يَتْبَعُهَا ذُبَابُ السَّيْفِ (tropical:)  [The knot,<br>\
or tail, at the end of the whip is followed by<br>\
the point of the sword; i. e., whipping (if it<br>\
effect not the desired correction) is followed by<br>\
slaughter]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b9-  [Hence,] ذُبَابٌ signifies likewise (assumed tropical:)  The حَدّ [or point, or extremity, or edge,]<br>\
of anything. (A &#39;Obeyd, T.) ―<br>\
-b10-  (tropical:)  The pointed,<br>\
