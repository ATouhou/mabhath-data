ذَأَنَهُ, [aor.<br>\
ذَاَ^َ,] inf. n. ذَأْنٌ, [app. from ذُؤْنُونٌ,<br>\
q. v.,] He held his state, or condition, to be contemptible and weak. (TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
ذَأْنَنَتِ الأَرْضُ The land produced the<br>\
kind of plant called ذُؤْنُون. (IAar, M.)<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
خَرَجُوا يَتَدَأْنَنُونَ (S, so in both of my<br>\
copies, and K and TK, but [erroneously] written<br>\
in the TT as from the M يتذأْنون, and in some<br>\
copies of the K يَتَذَآئَنُونَ, or يَتَذَآءَنُونَ, [the verb<br>\
being evidently a denominative from ذُؤْنُونٌ like<br>\
تَجَلْبَبَ from جِلْبَابٌ,]) They went forth (S, M,<br>\
K) to take, (S,) or to seek and take, (M,) or to<br>\
gather, (K,) the kind of plant called ذُؤْنُون<br>\
(S, M, K.)<br>\
ذُؤْنُونٌ [A kind, or species, of fungus; perhaps<br>\
a species of phallus;] a certain plant, (T, S, K,)<br>\
of the same kind as the عُرْجُون and the طُرْثُوثِ,<br>\
which grows in the winter, and, when the day<br>\
becomes hot, rots, and goes away; (IAar, T;)<br>\
said by Abu-l-&#39;Omeythil to be, in form, like the<br>\
هِلْيَوْن [or asparagus]: (T:) pl. ذَآنِينُ: (T, S:)<br>\
and some pronounce the sing. ذُونُونٌ, without ء;<br>\
and make the pl. ذَوَانِينُ: (T, TA:) a certain<br>\
plant that grows at the roots of the أَرْطَى and<br>\
رِمْث and أَلَآء; the ground cleaving, and disclosing<br>\
it, it comes forth like the سَوَاعِد [app. here<br>\
meaning the upper arms, above the elbows,] of<br>\
men; has no leaves; is black (أَسْحَمُ), and dustcoloured; is pointed [and roundish] in its extremity, like the glans of the penis in form; has<br>\
envelopes (أَكْمَامُ) like those of the [bean called]<br>\
بَاقِلَّى; and has a yellow fruit at its upper part:<br>\
some say that it is a plant that grows like the<br>\
[fungi called] عَرَاجِين, of the plants termed فُطْر:<br>\
AHn says that what are termed ذَآنِين are things<br>\
of the [fungi called] فُقُوع, that come forth from<br>\
beneath the ground like thick عُمُد [or poles];<br>\
nothing eats them, except that camels feed upon<br>\
them in the year of drought, and goats eat them<br>\
and fatten upon them; they have a root-stock<br>\
(أَرُومَة); and are used as medicines; and none<br>\
but the hungry will eat them, because of their<br>\
bitterness: he also says in one place, they grow<br>\
at the roots of trees, most like to the asparagus<br>\
(هِلْيَوْن), except that they are larger and thicker;<br>\
and have no leaves; but they have a بُرْعُومَة [app.<br>\
here meaning a head, such as is termed a pileus,<br>\
or cap], which assumes a roseate colour, and then<br>\
changes to yellow: the ذؤنون is all [full of]<br>\
water [or juice]; and is white, except what<br>\
appears thereof, of that بُرْعُومَة; and nothing eats<br>\
it, except when men are afflicted with drought<br>\
and have nothing [else] to eat: the n. un. is with<br>\
ة: (M:) ISh says that it is of a tawny colour,<br>\
smooth and round, having leaves that stick to it,<br>\
tall like the طُرْثُوث, not eaten save by sheep or<br>\
goats, [and grows] in plain, or soft, tracts: IB<br>\
says that it is the wild هِلْيَوْن. (TA.) One says<br>\
of a people who were characterized by courage<br>\
and excellence, and who have perished, their state<br>\
having changed, ذَآنِينُ لَا رِمْثَ لَهَا وَ طَرَاثِيثُ لَا أَرْطَى<br>\
[Dhu-noonehs having no rimthehs, and turthoothehs having no artáhs]: meaning that they have<br>\
been extirpated, and that none of them remains:<br>\
(TA:) or ذآنين لا رمث لها is a prov. applied<br>\
to him who is ruined, and has nothing remaining,<br>\
after having had a family and dignity and wealth.<br>\
(TA voce طُرْثُوثٌ.)<br>\
