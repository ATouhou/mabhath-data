(Kr,) [The cantharis, or Spanish fly;] a kind of<br>\
insect of a red colour, (S, A, K,) spotted, or<br>\
speckled, with black, which flies, (S, K,) and is<br>\
of a poisonous nature; (S, K;) a kind of insect<br>\
larger than the common fly, variegated with red<br>\
and black and yellow, having a pair of wings<br>\
with which it flies, and of a deadly poisonous<br>\
nature: when they desire to allay the heat of its<br>\
poison, they mix it with lentils, and so mixed it<br>\
becomes a remedy for him who has been bitten<br>\
by a mad dog: (IO:) Ibn-Ed-Dahhán the Lexicologist says that the ذرّوح is a kind of fly variegated with yellow and white; and what is called<br>\
فَرْخَةُ الدَّيْلَمِ: by certain of the acute physicians<br>\
it is described as حَيَوَانٌ دُودِىٌّ, app. meaning<br>\
a worm-like animal, of the size of the finger, and<br>\
of a conical shape, the head of which is at the<br>\
thickest part of it: and IDrst says that it is a<br>\
flying insect, resembling the زُنْبُور [or hornet],<br>\
and of a deadly poisonous nature. (TA.) It is<br>\
observed in the S, with reference to ذُرُّوحٌ, that,<br>\
in the opinion of Sb, لَيْسَ فِى الكَلَامِ فُعَّوْلٌ بِوَاحِدَةٌ;<br>\
meaning, there is not in the language a subst.<br>\
(as distinguished from an epithet) of the measure<br>\
فُعَّوْلٌ; (marg. note in a copy of the S;) or his<br>\
meaning is, [there is not a word of this measure]<br>\
with damm alone; (MF;) or with a single<br>\
dammeh, that is, to the ف; but with dammeh to<br>\
the ف and to the ع: (IB:) and it is added in<br>\
the S, that he (Sb) used to say سَبُّوحٌ and قَدُّوسٌ:<br>\
Sb, however, also mentions the forms سُبُّوحٌ and<br>\
قُدُّوسٌ. (MF.) The pl. is ذَرَايِحُ: (S, K:) in<br>\
the L, ذُرَّاحٌ is also said to be a pl.: and Kr<br>\
mentions ذَرَارِحُ; but AHát says that this last is<br>\
only used in poetry. (TA.) Sb says that the<br>\
sing. of ذَرَارِيحُ is ذُرَحْرَحٌ, (or, in other words, that<br>\
one of the [insects called] ذراريح is [called]<br>\
ذرحرح,) which is of the measure فُعَلْعَلٌ, and of<br>\
which the dim. is ↓ ذُرَيْرِحٌ, formed by throwing<br>\
out the first ذُريْرِحٌ; [not ح, as it would be by<br>\
rule, making it of the measure ذُرَيْحِرٌ, and its<br>\
curtailed original فُعَيْلِعٌ;] for there is not in the<br>\
language a word of the measure فعلع, except<br>\
فعلع, (S,) which is the proper name of a man.<br>\
(MF.) AHát cites a verse in which حَدْرَدٌ occurs<br>\
as pl. of ذَرَانِحُ; but the correct reading is ذرنوح.<br>\
