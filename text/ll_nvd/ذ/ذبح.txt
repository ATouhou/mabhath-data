ذُبَحَ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
ذَبَحَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
ذَبْحٌ (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ذُبَاحٌ, (K,) He cut, or<br>\
divided, lengthwise; clave; split; slit; rent, or<br>\
rent open; ripped, or ripped open. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
[Accord. to Fei,] this is the primary signification.<br>\
(Msb.) [But see what follows.] You say, ذَبَحَ<br>\
فَأْرَةَ المِسْكَ (assumed tropical:)  He (a perfumer, A) ripped open the<br>\
follicle, or vesicle, of mush, (A, TA,) and took<br>\
forth the mush that was in it. (TA.) [In the A<br>\
and TA this is said to be tropical; the authors<br>\
evidently holding it to be from ذَبَحَ in the sense<br>\
here next following.] ―<br>\
-b2-  He slaughtered [for<br>\
food, or sacrificed,] (L, TA) and animal, (Msb,)<br>\
or a sheep or goat, (S, TA,) or an ox or a cow,<br>\
and a sheep or goat, and the like, (Mgh,) [in the<br>\
manner prescribed by the law, i. e.,] by cutting<br>\
the وَدَجَانِ [or two external jugular veins], (Mgh,)<br>\
or by cutting the throat, from beneath, at the<br>\
part next the head: (L, TA:) accord. to the K,<br>\
i. q. نَحَرَ: but correctly, الذَّبْحُ is in the throat; and<br>\
النَّحْرُ is in the pit above the breast, between the<br>\
collar-bones, where camels are stabbed: the latter<br>\
word is used in relation to camels and bulls and<br>\
cows; and the former, in relation to other animals:<br>\
or, not improbably, both may have originally<br>\
signified the causing the soul to depart by wounding<br>\
the throat, or the pit above the breast, which is<br>\
the stabbing-place in the camel; and may then<br>\
have been applied in peculiar [and different]<br>\
senses by the lawyers. (MF. [See also ذَكَاةٌ, in<br>\
art. ذكو.]) Also (assumed tropical:)  He slaughtered, or slew, in<br>\
any manner. (L.) [You say, ذَبَحَ عَنْهُ He<br>\
slaughtered, or sacrificed, for him, by way of expiation.] And ذَبَحَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا (assumed tropical:)  [They slaughtered,<br>\
or slew, one another]. (S, K.) And أَخَذَهُمْ بَنُو<br>\
فُلَانٍ بِالذُّبَاحِ (assumed tropical:)  The sons of such a one slaughtered,<br>\
or slew, them. (TA.) And ↓ ذبّح (inf. n. تَذْبِيحٌ,<br>\
KL) signifies the same as ذَبَحَ, except that it<br>\
applies [only] to many objects; whereas the latter<br>\
applies to few and to many: thus it is said in the<br>\
Kur [ii. 46, and in like manner in xiv. 6],<br>\
يُذَبِّحُونَ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [They slaughtering, or slaying,<br>\
your sons], accord. to the reading commonly<br>\
obtaining. (Aboo-Is-hák, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence, (tropical:)  He<br>\
killed; because الذَّبْحُ [in its proper sense, when<br>\
the object is an animal,] is one of the quickest<br>\
modes of killing. (TA.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
(Mgh, TA,) cautioning against accepting the<br>\
office of a Kádee, (Mgh,) مَنْ جُعِلَ قَاضِيًا بَيْنَ<br>\
النَّاسِ فَكَأَنَّمَا ذُبِحَ بِغَيْرِ سِكِّينٍ (tropical:)  [Whoso is made a<br>\
Kádee among the people, he is as though he were<br>\
slaughtered without a knife]: (Mgh, TA: *) expl.<br>\
by some as meaning, (tropical:)  he is as though he were<br>\
killed [&amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence, also, because<br>\
الذَّبْحُ renders the flesh of an animal allowable, or<br>\
lawful, as food,] (tropical:)  It rendered allowable, or lawful: as salt and the sun and the fishes called<br>\
نِينَان (pl. of نُونٌ) do wine, by changing its<br>\
quality, as is said in a trad. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also (tropical:)  He<br>\
broached, or pierced, a دَنّ [or wine-jar, making<br>\
a hole in the mouth, or removing the clay that<br>\
closed the mouth], so as to draw forth the contents. (S, A, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And (tropical:)  He, or it,<br>\
choked. (K, TA.) You say, ذَبَحَتْهُ العَبْرَةُ (tropical:)  Weeping choked him. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And, said of thirst,<br>\
(tropical:)  It affected him severely, or distressed him.<br>\
(A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  ذَبَحَتِ اللِّحْيَةُ فُلَانًا (tropical:)  The beard<br>\
flowed down beneath the chin of such a one so<br>\
that the anterior portion of the part beneath his<br>\
lower jaw was apparent: in which case, the man<br>\
is said to be بِلِحْيَتِهِ ↓ مَذْبُوحٌ. (K, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
ذَبَّحَ see 1.<br>\
-A2-  تَذْبِيحٌ is [said to be] syn. with<br>\
تَذْبِيحٌ, (K, TA,) in prayer: accord. to Hr, ذبّح<br>\
رَأْسَهُ signifies He lowered his head, in inclining<br>\
his body in prayer; like دبّح: and accord. to<br>\
Lth, ذبّح signifies he lowered his head, in<br>\
inclining his body in prayer, so that it became<br>\
lower than his back: but Az says that this is a<br>\
mistake, and that the correct word is دبّح, with<br>\
the unpointed د. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تذابحوا (assumed tropical:)  They slaughtered, or slew, one<br>\
another. (S, MA, K.) One says, التَّمَادُحُ التَّذَابُحُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Mutual praising is mutual slaughtering].<br>\
(S, A.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِذَّبَحَ He took, or prepared, for himself a<br>\
slaughtered [or sacrificed] animal. (S, K.)<br>\
ذِبْحٌ An animal prepared for slaughter [or<br>\
sacrifice; i. e. an intended victim]: (T, A, Msb,<br>\
TA:) [see also ذَبِيحٌ, which occurs in this sense<br>\
in a trad. as applied to a human being:] or an<br>\
animal that is slaughtered [or sacrificed]; (S,<br>\
Mgh, K, TA;) and so ↓ ذَبِيحَةٌ; (Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
or this signifies a slaughtered [or sacrificed] sheep<br>\
or goat; (TA;) and is [nominally] fem. of ذَبِيحٌ,<br>\
but the ة is affixed only because the quality of a<br>\
subst. is predominant in it: (S:) or the ذَبِيحٌ is added<br>\
to denote that the word is applied to a sheep, or<br>\
goat, [to be slaughtered or sacrificed,] not yet<br>\
slaughtered [or sacrificed]; and when the act has<br>\
been executed upon it, it is [said to be] ذَبِيحٌ:<br>\
(M, voce رَمِيَّةٌ:) ذِبْحٌ is applied to an animal that<br>\
is slaughtered either as a sacrifice on the occasion<br>\
of the pilgrimage or otherwise; and is like طِحْنٌ<br>\
in the sense of مَطْحُونٌ, and عِطْفٌ in the sense of<br>\
مَعْطُوفٌ, &amp;c.: (TA:) the pl. of ↓ ذَبِيحَةٌ is ذَبَائِحُ.<br>\
(Mgh, Msb.) It is said in the Kur [xxxvii. 107],<br>\
وَفَدَيْنَاهُ بِدِبْحٍ عَظِيمٍ [And we ransomed him with<br>\
a great victim]. (S, A.) الجِنِّ ↓ ذَبَائِحُ means<br>\
Animals sacrificed to the Jinn, or Genii: for it<br>\
was customary for a man, when he bought a<br>\
house, or drew forth [for the first time] the water<br>\
of a spring, and the like, to sacrifice an animal<br>\
to the Jinn with the view of avoiding ill luck,<br>\
(A, TA,) lest some disagreeable accident should<br>\
happen to him from the Jinn thereof: (A:) and<br>\
the doing this is forbidden. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also ذُبَحَةٌ.<br>\
ذُبَحٌ A certain plant which ostriches eat: (S:)<br>\
this word and ↓ ذِبَحٌ signify the plant called الجَزَرُ<br>\
البَّرىُّ, (K, TA,) which is of a red colour: and,<br>\
accord. to the K, another plant: but correctly a<br>\
red plant (نَبْتٌ أَحْمَرُ, not نبت آخَرُ,) having a<br>\
stem, or root, (أَصْلٌ) from which is peeled off a<br>\
black peel, whereupon there is taken forth a<br>\
white substance, resembling a white خزرة [or<br>\
bead, but perhaps this is a mistranscription for<br>\
جَزَرَة, i. e. a carrot], which is sweet and good, and<br>\
is eaten: [each word is a coll. gen. n.;] and the<br>\
n. un. is ذُبَحَةٌ and ذِبَحَةٌ: so says AHn, on the<br>\
authority of Fr: and he says also, on the authority<br>\
of AA, that the ذُبَحَة is a tree that grows upon a<br>\
stem, and in a manner resembling the كراث [app.<br>\
كَرَاث, not كُرَّاث], and then has a yellow flower;<br>\
its root is like a جزرة [i. e. جَزَرَة, or carrot], and it<br>\
is sweet, and of a red colour: (TA:) or the ذُبَح<br>\
is a plant having a stem, or root, (أَصْلٌ,) which<br>\
is peeled, and there comes forth what resembles<br>\
the جِزر [i. e. جِزَر or جَزَر, meaning carrot]; and a<br>\
black skin is peeled from it; and it is sweet, and<br>\
is eaten; and has a red flower. (Ham p. 777.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, and ↓ ذِبَحٌ, (K,) the former the more<br>\
common, (Th, TA,) A species of the كَمْأَةٌ [or<br>\
truffle], (K,) of a white colour. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See<br>\
also ذُبَاحٌ.<br>\
ذِبَحٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
ذُبْحَةٌ: see ذُبَحَةٌ.<br>\
ذِبْحَةٌ A mode, or manner, of ذَبْح [i. e. slaughter,<br>\
such as is described in the first paragraph of this<br>\
art.]. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  See also what here next follows.<br>\
ذُبَحَةٌ (AZ, S, A, K) and ↓ ذُبْحَهٌ, (As, A, K,)<br>\
but this latter, which is used by the vulgar, was<br>\
unknown to AZ, (S,) and ↓ ذُبَاحٌ (A, K) and<br>\
↓ ذِبَحَةٌ and ↓ ذِبْحَةٌ and ↓ ذِبَاحٌ (K) and ↓ ذِبْحٌ,<br>\
(TA,) A disease, (T, A,) or pain, (AZ, S, K,) in<br>\
the حَلْق [or fauces], (AZ, T, S, A, K,) which<br>\
sometimes kills: (T:) or blood which chokes and<br>\
kills: (K:) or an ulcer that comes forth in the<br>\
حَلْق [or fauces] of a man, like the ذِئْبَة that<br>\
attacks the ass: (ISh, TA:) or an ulcer that<br>\
appears in that part, obstructing it, and stopping<br>\
the breath, and killing. (TA.) One says, أَخَذَتْهُ<br>\
الذُّبَحَةُ [The ذبحة attacked him]. (S.) And<br>\
↓ الطَّمَعُ ذُبَاحٌ (tropical:)  Covetousness is [like] a disease in<br>\
the fauces: or a poisonous plant. (A.) And<br>\
كَانَ ذٰلِكَ مِثْلَ الذُّبَحَةِ عَلَى النَّحْرِ [That was like<br>\
the disease called ذبحة in the uppermost part of<br>\
the breast]: a prov., applied to the case of a man<br>\
whom one imagines to be a sincere friend, and<br>\
who proves to be an evident enemy: (TA:) or<br>\
كَانَ مِثْلَ الذُّبَحَةِ الخ He was like the ذبحة &amp;c.,<br>\
a disease in the حَلْق, which does not quit the<br>\
patient externally, and hurts him internally: said<br>\
by him to whom you complain of one whom you<br>\
imagined to be a sincere friend, and whose affection was outward, when his deceit has become<br>\
manifest. (Meyd.)<br>\
-A2-  دُبَحَةٌ is also the n. un. of<br>\
ذُبَحٌ [q. v.]. (Fr, AHn.)<br>\
ذِبَحَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
It is also the n. un. of ذِبَحٌ [q. v. voce ذَُبَحٌ].<br>\
(Fr, AHn.)<br>\
ذُبَاحٌ A certain poisonous plant, (A, K, TA,)<br>\
that kills the eater of it; as also ↓ ذُبَحٌ. (TA.)<br>\
One says, الطَّمَعُ . ذُبَاحٌ: see ذُبَحَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] مَوْتٌ ذُبَاحٌ (assumed tropical:)  A quick, or sudden,<br>\
death. (L.)<br>\
-A2-  See also ذُبَّاحٌ.<br>\
ذِبَاحٌ: see ذُبَحَةٌ.<br>\
ذَبِيحٌ and ↓ مَذْبُوحٌ signify the same [i. e. Cut,<br>\
or divided, lengthwise; &amp;c.: see 1]. (S, Msb, K,<br>\
TA.) You say مِسْكٌ ذَبِيحٌ [for ذَبِيحٌ فَأْرَتُهُ],<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Musk of which the follicle, or vesicle,<br>\
is] ripped open. (A. [It is there said to be<br>\
tropical: but see 1.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Both are [also] applied<br>\
to an animal, (Msb,) or a sheep or goat, (TA,)<br>\
[or an animal of the ox-kind, and a sheep or goat,<br>\
and the like, (see 1,)] as meaning Slaughtered, in<br>\
the manner described in the first paragraph of<br>\
this art.: (TA:) the fem. of ذَبِيحٌ is with ة: (S,<br>\
TA: [see ذَبِيحَةٌ below:]) but ذَبِيحٌ is used as a<br>\
fem. epithet without the addition of ة: you say<br>\
شَاةٌ ذَبِيحٌ as well as كَبْشٌ ذَبِيحٌ, because ذَبِيحٌ is<br>\
an instance of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of<br>\
the measure مَفْعُولٌ; though you say شاة ذَبِيحَةٌ<br>\
also; and in like manner نَاقَةٌ: the pl. [of ذَبِيحٌ] is<br>\
ذَبْحَى and ذَبَاحَى and [that of ذَبِيحَةٌ is] ذَبَائِحُ.<br>\
(TA.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb says, describing wine,<br>\
يُقَالُ لَهَا دَمُ الوَدَجِ الذَّبِيحُ<br>\
meaning المَذْبُوحُ عَنْهُ, i. e. [One would call it the<br>\
blood of the external jugular vein,] for which it<br>\
had been slit [to let it flow]. (AAF, TA.) And<br>\
again he says,<br>\
وَسِرْبٍ تَطَلَّى بِالعَبِيرِ كَأَنَّهُ<br>\
دِمَآءُ ظِبَآءُ بِالنُّحُورِ ذَبِيحُ<br>\
[app. meaning And many a bevy of women rubbed<br>\
over with perfume compounded with saffron, as<br>\
though it were the blood of gazelles, the gazelles<br>\
whereof had been slaughtered in the upper parts<br>\
of the breasts]: he applies ذبيح as an epithet to<br>\
دمآء, meaning ذَبِيحٌ ظِبَاؤُهُ; and he applies it as an<br>\
epithet to a pl. n. because it is of the measure<br>\
فَعِيلٌ [in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ], for<br>\
such an epithet is applicable to masc. and fem.<br>\
and sing. and pl. nouns. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ذَبِيحٌ also<br>\
signifies An animal that is fit, or proper, to be<br>\
slaughtered as a sacrifice: (ISk, S, K:) [or that<br>\
is destined, or prepared, for sacrifice; i. e., an<br>\
intended victim; like ذِبْحٌ; as appears from the<br>\
fact that] الذَّبِيحُ is (assumed tropical:)  a surname of Ismá&#39;eel, or<br>\
Ishmael; (K, * TA;) for, accord. to some [or<br>\
rather the generality] of the Muslims, he was the<br>\
son whom Abraham designed to sacrifice, though<br>\
others say it was Isaac: (TA:) and أَنَا ابْنُ<br>\
الذَّبِيحَيْنِ occurs in a trad. [as said by Mohammad,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  I am the son of the two intended<br>\
victims; namely, Ismá&#39;eel and &#39;Abd-Allah]; for<br>\
&#39;Abd-El-Muttalib incurred the obligation to sacrifice his son &#39;Abd-Allah, the father of the Prophet,<br>\
by reason of a vow, and ransomed him with a<br>\
hundred camels. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (tropical:)  A slain<br>\
man. (A.)<br>\
ذَبِيحَةٌ, and its pl. ذَبَائِحُ: see ذِبْحٌ, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
[<br>\
ذَبَّاحٌ One whose occupation, or habit, is that<br>\
of slaughtering sheep or the like. ―<br>\
-b2-  And, in the<br>\
present day, (assumed tropical:)  An executioner.]<br>\
ذُبَّاحٌ (T, S, K) and sometimes ↓ ذُبَاحٌ, without<br>\
teshdeed, (T, K,) the former the more common,<br>\
(T, K,) but disallowed by AHeyth, who holds it<br>\
to be one of the words of the measure فُعَالٌ<br>\
denoting diseases, (TA,) (tropical:)  Cracks in the inner<br>\
[i. e. lower] sides of the toes, (S, K, TA,) next the<br>\
fore part of the foot: (TA:) or a cut across the<br>\
inner sides of the toes: (Ibn-Buzurj, T:) or a<br>\
crack in the inner side, or sole, of the foot:<br>\
(IAar, TA voce نَكْبَةٌ:) pl. ذَبَابِيحُ. (TA.) Hence<br>\
the saying, مَا دُونَهُ شَوْكَةٌ وَلَا ذُبَّاحٌ (tropical:)  [There is not<br>\
in the way of its attainment a thorn nor are<br>\
there any cracks in the inner sides of the toes, &amp;c.:<br>\
see also نَكْبَةٌ]. (S, TA.)<br>\
ذَابِحٌ [act. part. n. of 1]. سَعْدُ الذَّابِحِ, (S, K,)<br>\
or سَعْدٌ الذَّابِحُ, (so in one copy of the S,) (assumed tropical:)  Two<br>\
bright stars, between which is the space of a cubit<br>\
(ذِرَاع), over against one of which (فِىنَحْرِ وَاحِدٍ<br>\
مِنْهُمَا) is a small star that, by reason of its nearness, is as though it [app. meaning the bright<br>\
star, or the pair of bright stars,] were about to<br>\
slaughter it; (S, K;) whence the appellation of<br>\
الذَّابِح: (S:) the two stars [alpha and beta] which are<br>\
in one of the horns of Capricornus; so called<br>\
because of the small adjacent star, which is said<br>\
to be the sheep or goat (شاة) of الذابح, which he<br>\
is about to slaughter: (Kzw:) it is one of the<br>\
Mansions of the Moon; (S, Kzw;) [namely,<br>\
the Twenty-second Mansion: see also art. سعد:<br>\
some give this appellation to the Twenty-third<br>\
Mansion: and some, to the Twenty-fifth; but<br>\
the two stars above mentioned are clearly the<br>\
Twenty-second, with the place of which they<br>\
agree accord. to those who make النَّوءُ to signify<br>\
“ the auroral rising ” and those who make it to<br>\
signify “ the auroral setting: ” see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in<br>\
art. نزل.] The Arabs [used to] say, إِذَا طَلَعَ<br>\
الذَّابِحُ انْجَحَرَ النَّابِحُ (assumed tropical:)  [When الذابح rises aurorally, the barker enters, or betakes itself to, its<br>\
hole: the period of its auroral rising, in Central<br>\
Arabia, about the commencement of the era of<br>\
the Flight, being the 16th of January, O. S.].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\

made. (L, K.) ―<br>\

part immediately beneath the lower jaw and the<br>\
part [of the throat] in which an animal is<br>\
slaughtered. (K.)<br>\
ذَابِحَةٌ, of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولَةٌ, [with ة affixed because the<br>\
quality of a subst. is predominant in it,] Any<br>\
animal which it is allowable to slaughter, of<br>\
camels, and bulls or cows, and sheep or goats, &amp;c.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَذْبَحٌ The place of [the slaughter termed]<br>\
الذَّبْح: (K:) i. e. the place, or spot of ground,<br>\
where الذبح is performed: and the part of the<br>\

مَذَابِح are the مَحَارِيب (S, A, K) of the Christians; (A;) so called because of the oblations<br>\
(قَرَابِين) there offered; (S, TA;) the مَقَاصِير<br>\
(K, TA) in churches, pl. of مَقْصُورَةٌ; said to be<br>\

(A,) or chambers, (K,) of the books of the Christians. (A, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  A trench (S, A, K) in the<br>\
earth, measuring a span or the like [in width],<br>\
(S, K,) such as is made by a torrent: (S, A:)<br>\
the channel of a torrent in the lower part of the<br>\
face of a mountain, or in a plain depressed tract,<br>\
in width equal to the space measured by the<br>\
extension of the thumb and first finger or little<br>\
finger; and sometimes it is a natural trench in a<br>\
plain tract of land, like a river, in which flows<br>\
the water of that land: it is in all descriptions<br>\
of land; in valleys &amp;c., and in depressed tracts:<br>\
(L:) and a kind of river; as though it clave<br>\
[the earth] or were cleft: (TA:) pl. مَذَابِحُ.<br>\
