load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'ذوذُو meaning صَاحِب [i. e. A possessor, an<br>\
owner, a lord, or a master, but often better rendered having, possessing, possessed of, or endowed<br>\
with], (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, but omitted in<br>\
the CK,) used as a prefixed noun, (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
&amp;c.,) is originally ذَوًا, like عَصًا, the ا being<br>\
changed from و; (S;) or it is originally ذَوَّى;<br>\
and if one used it as a proper name, he would<br>\
say, هٰذَا ذَوَّىقَدْ جَآءَ [This is Dhawà, he has<br>\
come]; (M;) [not ذَوًا, as in copies of the S; i. e.,]<br>\
its third radical letter is ى, not, as J says,<br>\
و; this ى being afterwards suppressed; (IB;)<br>\
[so that the word becomes ذَوٌ, and then, by reason<br>\
of its being prefixed to another noun, ذُو, like as<br>\
أَبَوٌ, the original form of أَبٌ, becomes أَبُو:] it is<br>\
declined [like أَبُو] with و and | and ىِ; (Msb;)<br>\
[i. e.,] the nom. case is ذُو, accus. ذَا, and gen.<br>\
ذِى: (Mgh:) the fem. is ذَاتُ; (T, S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K; in a copy of the M, ذاة, and the CK,<br>\
ذَاةٌ [as though it were not a prefixed noun];) and<br>\
in the case of a pause, some say ذَاتْ, and others<br>\
say ذَاهْ: (Lth, T: the latter usage, only, is mentioned in the S:) dual. masc., ذَوَا, (S, * M,)<br>\
[accus and gen. ذَوَىْ;] fem. ذَوَاتَا, (T, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) for which ذَاتَا is allowable in poetry,<br>\
but ذَوَاتَا is better, (T,) [accus, and gen. ذَوَاتَىْ:]<br>\
pl., masc., ذَوُو, (T, *, S, * M, Msb, K, but omitted<br>\
in the CK,) [accus, and gen. ذَوِى;] fem. ذَوَاتُ,<br>\
(T, S, * M, Mgh, Msb, K,) accus. and gen. ذَوَاتِ;<br>\
(S;) and أُولُو and أُولَات are like ذَوُو and ذَوَات<br>\
[in signification]. (T. [See art. الو.]) In this<br>\
sense it is not used otherwise than as a prefixed<br>\
noun: when used to characterize an indeterminate<br>\
noun, prefixed to an indeterminate noun; and<br>\
when used to characterize a determinate noun,<br>\
prefixed to [a noun rendered determinate by] the<br>\
article ال. (S.) [Thus you say رَجُلٌ ذُو مَالٍ A<br>\
man a possessor of wealth; and الرَّجُلُ ذُو المَالِ<br>\
The man the possessor of wealth.] In the phrase<br>\
غَيْرَ ذَاتِ الشَوْكَةِ [Not those possessed of weapons,<br>\
&amp;c.], in the Kur [viii. 7], the fem. form is used<br>\
as meaning the طَائِفَة [or party]. (T.) صَارَ ذَا ذَنْبٍ<br>\
[He became one having a sin, or crime, &amp;c.,<br>\
attributable to him, i. e. he had a sin, &amp;c., attributable to him,] means تَحَمَّلَ ذَنْبًا [he became<br>\
chargeable with a sin, &amp;c.]. (Msb in art. ذنب.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to the S, it is not prefixed to a pronoun (مُضْمَر); nor to a proper name, such as زَيْد<br>\
and عَمْرو and the like: but there are several<br>\
instances of its being prefixed, in its pl. form, to<br>\
a pronoun; among which is the saying of a poet,<br>\
إِنَّمَا يَصْطَنِعُ المَعْرُوفُ فِى النَّاسِ ذَوُوهُ<br>\
[Only they who are possessors thereof do that<br>\
which is good among men]: (TA:) [this usage,<br>\
however, is perhaps only allowable by poetic<br>\
license: see another ex. (also here cited in the<br>\
TA) in the Ham p. 442, and the remarks there<br>\
appended to it:] and it is also prefixed to proper<br>\
names, as is shown by the phrase, (TA,) هٰذَا ذُو<br>\
زَيْدٍ (M, K, TA,) mentioned, as heard from the<br>\
Arabs, by Ahmad Ibn-Ibráheem, the preceptor of<br>\
Th, meaning This is Zeyd, (M, TA,) i. e., this is<br>\
the owner of the name Zeyd; (M, K, TA;) and<br>\
[perhaps] by the name ذُو الخَلَصَةِ, for الخلصة is<br>\
[said by some to be] the name of a certain idol,<br>\
and ذو is a metonymical appellation of its بَيْت;<br>\
and by the proper names ذُو رُعَيْنٍ and ذُو يَزَنَ and<br>\
[accord. to some] ذُو جَدْنٍ [and the like, of which<br>\
several are mentioned in the S, as well as in the<br>\
M &amp;c.]. (IB, TA.) [But see a later portion<br>\
of this paragraph, where, prefixed to a proper<br>\
name, it is said to be redundant.] ―<br>\
-b3-  ذَوُو الأَرْحَام,<br>\
[or, as in the Kur viii. last verse, and xxxiii. 6,<br>\
أُولُو الأَرْحَامِ, pls. of ذُو الرَّحِمِ,] in the classical<br>\
language, means [The possessors of relationship;<br>\
i. e.] any relations: and in law, any relations that<br>\
have no portion [of the inheritances termed فَرَائِض]<br>\
and are not [such heirs as are designated by the<br>\
appellation] عَصَبَة [q. v.: they are so called because they are relations by the women&#39;s side: see<br>\
رَحِمٌ]. (KT, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  If you form a pl. from<br>\
ذُومَالٍ, you say, هٰؤُلَآءِ ذَوُونَ [These are possessors<br>\
of wealth]; because in this case the pl. is not a<br>\
prefixed noun. (S.) Accord. to Lth, الذَّوُونَ<br>\
signifies The former, or first, [of persons,] and<br>\
the more, or most, distinguished. (T, TA. *)<br>\
Also, (S, M,) and الأَذْوَآءُ, [which is another pl.<br>\
of ذُو,] (S,) The kings (S, M) of El-Yemen, of<br>\
the tribe of Kudá&#39;ah, (S,) whose surnames commenced with ذُو, (M,) [i. e.] who were named [or<br>\
rather surnamed] (S) ذُو يَزَنَ (S, M) and ذُو جَدَنٍ<br>\
and ذُو نُوَاسٍ (S) and the like. (S, M.) قُرَشِىٌّ<br>\
لَيْسَ مِنْ ذِى وَلَا ذُو, occurring in a trad., means<br>\
A Kurashee in respect of lineage, not of the<br>\
أَذْوَآء [above mentioned]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [ذُو and ذَات<br>\
and ذَا and ذِى are also used as prefixed nouns<br>\
in various expressions here following, in several<br>\
thereof as meaning Something in possession, or the<br>\
like; not a possessor: or, in these instances, as is<br>\
said in explanation of the first of the following<br>\
phrases, and also of the phrase ذَاتُ اليَدِ (mentioned below) in Har p. 93, that which is contained<br>\
is made to be as though it were the possessor<br>\
(صَاحِب) of that which contains.] ―<br>\
-b6-  مَوَّتَ ذَابَطْنِهَا<br>\
[He killed what was in her belly]. (Har ubi<br>\
suprá.) And وَضَعَتِ المَرْأَةُ ذَا بَطْنِهَا, (T,) or ذَاتَ<br>\
بَطْنِهَا, (TA,) The woman brought forth [her<br>\
child]. (T, TA.) And نَثَرَتْ ذَا بَطْنِهَا She brought<br>\
forth many children. (T in art. نثر; and Mgh<br>\
there and in the present art., in the latter of which<br>\
it is added that the usual phrase is نَثَرَتْ بَطْنَهَا.)<br>\
And أَلْقَتِ الدَّجَاجَةُ ذَا بَطْنِهَا The hen laid her egg,<br>\
or eggs: or muted. (Mgh.) And أَلْقَى الرَّجُلُ ذَا<br>\
بَطْنِهِ The man ejected his excrement, or ordure.<br>\
(T.) And الذِّئْبُ مَغْبُوطٌ بِذِى بَطْنِهِ The wolf is<br>\
envied [for what is in his belly, or] for his distention of the belly [with food]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [In<br>\
like manner,] ذَاتُ اليَدِ means (tropical:)  Wealth; as though<br>\
it were the possessor of that which contains it:<br>\
(Har ubi suprá:) [or what is in the possession of<br>\
the hand:] or what one possesses, of wealth;<br>\
because gained by the hand and disposed of by<br>\
the hand. (Har p. 66.) You say, قَلَّتْ ذَاتُ يَدِهِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  What his hand possessed became little in quantity; (Lth, T;) or the possessions accompanying<br>\
his hand; (Mgh;) app. meaning his riches.<br>\
(Lth, T.) ―<br>\
-b8-  ذَاتُ الرِّئَةِ and ذَاتُ الجَنْبِ are Two<br>\
well-known diseases. (TA. [See arts. رأى and<br>\
جنب.]) ―<br>\
-b9-  عَلِيمٌ بِذَاتِ الصُّدُورِ, in the Kur iii. 115,<br>\
means [Acquainted, or well acquainted,] with<br>\
what is in the minds: (Ksh, Bd, Jel: [and the<br>\
like is indicated in the Mgh:]) or with the true,<br>\
or real, nature of the notions that are concealed<br>\
in the minds: (IAmb, T:) or with the hidden<br>\
things of the minds: or with the minds themselves.<br>\
(Msb. [If the last meaning be correct, the phrase<br>\
should be mentioned with others later in this<br>\
paragraph.]) [And similar to this is the saying,]<br>\
عَرَفَهُ مِنْ ذَاتِ نَفْسِهِ He knew it from what he<br>\
conceived in his mind [without his being informed<br>\
thereof; i. e. he knew it of himself]. (Lth, T.)<br>\
And جَآءَ مِنْ ذِىنَفْسِهِ and مِنْ ذَاتِ نَفْسِهِ (M,<br>\
K) He came [from a motive in his own mind;<br>\
of himself;] of his own accord; or willingly;<br>\
syn. طَيِّعًا: (M, TA:) in the copies of the K,<br>\
طَبْعًا; but the former is the right explanation.<br>\
(TA.) And مَا كَلَّمْتُ فُلَانًا ذَاتَ شَفَةٍ and ذَاتَ فَمٍ<br>\
I spoke not to such a one a word. (AZ, T.) ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
ذَاتَ اليَمِينِ and ذَاتَ الشِّمَالِ [are adverbial expressions, and] mean In the direction of the right<br>\
hand and of the left: properly in the direction<br>\
that has the name of the right hand [and that has<br>\
the name of the left hand]. (Bd in xviii. 16.)<br>\
And أَتَيْنَا ذَا يَمِينٍ means We came on the right<br>\
hand. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  ذَاتَ مَرَّةٍ and ذَا صَبَاحٍ [also, and<br>\
the like,] are adverbial expressions, which may<br>\
not be used otherwise than as such: (S:) you say,<br>\
لَقِيتُهُ ذَاتَ مَرَّةٍ [I met him once, or once upon a<br>\
time], (S,) and ذَاتَ المِرَارِ many times, (M and K<br>\
in art. مر,) or sometimes, (S in that art.,) and<br>\
ذَاتَ يَوْمٍ (Fr, T, S) i. e. مَرَّةً فِى يَوْمٍ [once upon a<br>\
day, or one day], therefore you use the fem. form,<br>\
(T,) and ذَاتَ لَيْلَةٍ [one night], (Fr, T, S,) and<br>\
ذَاتَ غَدَاةٍ [one morning, or one morning between<br>\
daybreak and sunrise], and ذَاتَ العِشَآءِ [once in<br>\
the evening at nightfall], (S,) meaning, accord.<br>\
to Th, in the hour, or time, in which is nightfall,<br>\
(T,) and ذَاتَ الزُّمَيْنِ (Fr, T, S) [some time ago,<br>\
or] three [or more, to ten,] seasons ago, (مُذْ ثَلَاثَةُ<br>\
أَزْمَانٍ, T, [by ازمان being app. meant periods of<br>\
two, or three, or six, months,]) and ذَاتَ العُوَيْمِ<br>\
(Fr, T, S) [some years ago, or] three years ago<br>\
(T,) or three years ago or more, to ten; (Az<br>\
on the authority of AZ, TA in art. عوم;) and<br>\
ذَا صَبَاحٍ [one morning], and ذَا مَسَآءٍ [one evening],<br>\
(T, S,) and ذَا صَبُوحٍ [lit, at a time of drinking<br>\
the morning-draught], and ذَا غَبُوقٍ [lit. at a time<br>\
of drinking the evening-draught]; in these four<br>\
instances without ة: and this mode of expression<br>\
has been heard only in the cases of the times here<br>\
mentioned: they did not say ذَاتَ شَهْرٍ nor ذَاتَ سَنَةٍ:<br>\
(S:) or one may also well say ذَاتَ صَبَاحٍ, like<br>\
ذَاتَ يَوْمٍ; for ذا and ذات both mean the time:<br>\
and accord. to IAar, one says, أَتَيْتُهُ ذَاتَ الصَّبُوحِ<br>\
and ذَاتَ الغَبُوقِ, as meaning I came to him in the<br>\
morning, or in the morning between daybreak and<br>\
sunrise, and in the evening, or in the evening<br>\
between sunset and nightfall. (T.) ―<br>\
-b12-  You say<br>\
also, لَقِيتُهُ ذَاتَ يَدَيْنِ, (TA,) or لَقِيتُهُ أَوَّلَ ذِى<br>\
يَدَيْنِ (M) and ذَاتِ يَدَيْنِ, (AZ, M, Msb, [whence<br>\
it seems to be not improbable that the phrase in<br>\
the TA is imperfectly transcribed,]) meaning I<br>\
met him the first thing, (M,) or first of everything.<br>\
(AZ, Msb, TA.) And أَفْعَلُهُ أَوَّلَ ذِى يَدَيْنِ and<br>\
ذَاتِ يَدَيْنِ [I will do it the first thing, or first of<br>\
everything]. (M.) And أَمَّا أَوَّلَ ذَاتِ يَدَيْنِ فَإِنَّنِى<br>\
أَحْمَدُ اللّٰهَ, (AZ, M, Msb,) i. e. [Whatever be the<br>\
case, the first thing, or] first of everything, I<br>\
praise God. (AZ, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b13-  [Respecting the<br>\
phrase ذَاتُ البَيْنِ, which has two contr. meanings,<br>\
see art. بين. It is inadequately explained in this<br>\
art. in the T and M and K, as follows.] وَأَصْلِحُوا<br>\
ذَاتَ بَيْنِكُمْ, (T, M, K, *) in the Kur [viii. 1],<br>\
accord. to Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà, means [And do<br>\
ye rightly dispose, or arrange, or order,] the<br>\
case that is between you: (T:) or, accord. to<br>\
Zj, (M,) that wherein consists your union;<br>\
(حَقِيقَةَ وَصْلِكُمْ, M, K;) i. e. be ye of one accord,<br>\
or in unison, respecting that which God and his<br>\
Apostle have commanded: (M:) or ذَاتُ البَيْنِ<br>\
means the state of circumstances whereby the<br>\
Muslims become of one accord, or in unison:<br>\
(K:) this is the meaning in the saying, اَللّٰهُمَّ<br>\
أَصْلِحْ ذَاتَ البَيْنِ [O God, do Thou rightly dispose &amp;c.]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b14-  ذَاتٌ is sometimes used as a<br>\
noun independent in its meaning, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
so as to denote material [or real] things; (Msb;)<br>\
and is described by the epithets مُتَمَيِّزَةٌ [or “ distinct ”] (Mgh, Msb) and قَدِيمَةٌ [as meaning<br>\
“ that has existed from eternity ”] (Mgh) and<br>\
مُحْدَثَةٌ [as meaning “ that has been brought into<br>\
existence ”]. (Mgh, Msb.) Thus used, (Msb,)<br>\
it signifies The essence of a thing, meaning that<br>\
by being which a thing is what it is, or that in<br>\
being which a thing consists; or the ultimate and<br>\
radical constituent of a thing: and the essence as<br>\
meaning the peculiar nature of a thing: syn.<br>\
حَقِيقَةٌ, (T, IB, Msb, TA,) and مَاهِيَّةٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
and خَاصَّةٌ: (T, IB, TA:) it is also used as<br>\
meaning a thing&#39;s self: (Mgh, * Msb:) [a man&#39;s<br>\
self, or person: (see شَخْصٌ:)] and a thing; a<br>\
being; anything, whatever it be; every شَىْء being<br>\
a ذَات, and every ذات being a شىء: (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed,<br>\
Mgh, Msb:) and particularly a substance, or thing<br>\
that subsists by itself: [hence اِسْمُ ذَاتٍ meaning<br>\
a real substantive; also termed اِسْمُ عَيْنٍ: opposed<br>\
to اِسْمُ مَعْنًى, i. e. an ideal substantive:] and<br>\
[hence] it signifies also a word that is independent<br>\
in its meaning; [i. e. ذَاتٌ (alone), though oftener<br>\
used in the sense assigned above to اِسْمُ ذَاتٍ,<br>\
signifies also, absolutely, a substantive;] opposed<br>\
to صِفَةٌ as signifying a word that is not independent in its meaning. (Kull p. 187.) Its application to God, in the sense of حَقِيقَةٌ and خَاصَّةٌ,<br>\
is forbidden by most persons: (TA:) [for]<br>\
ذَاتُ اللّٰهِ [as meaning The essence of God], used<br>\
by the scholastic theologians, is said to be an<br>\
ignorant expression, because the names of God<br>\
do not admit the fem. affix ة; so that one does<br>\
not apply to Him the epithet عَلَّامَةٌ, though He<br>\
is the all-surpassing in knowledge. (Msb.) The<br>\
phrase فِى ذَاتِ اللّٰهِ is like فِى جَنْبِ اللّٰهِ [In, or<br>\
in respect of, that which is the right, or due, of<br>\
God; or in, or in respect of, obedience to God, or<br>\
the means of obtaining nearness to God, or the<br>\
way of God]: and like لِوَجْهِ اللّٰهِ [for the sake of<br>\
God; or to obtain the countenance, or favour,<br>\
or approbation, or recompense, of God]: (Msb:)<br>\
or it means in obedience to God; and in the way<br>\
of God or his religion: (TA:) [or it may be<br>\
rendered for the sake of God Himself; and so<br>\
لِوَجْهِ اللّٰهِ: it is said to have been used by the<br>\
Arabs [of the classical age], as well as by Aboo-Temmám, [who was a Muwelled;] (Mgh, Msb, *)<br>\
but some deny that it occurs in the old language.<br>\
(Msb. [See, however, an ex. from a trad. voce<br>\
أُخَيْشِنُ.]) [It is said that] the phrase مَجَلَّتُهُمْ ذَاتُ<br>\
الإِلٰهِ, used by En-Nábighah, (Msb,) i. e. EdhDhubyánee, (TA in art. جل,) means Their book<br>\
is the service of God Himself: (Msb:) [but<br>\
it seems more reasonable to render this phrase<br>\
agreeably with the primary signification of ذات<br>\
as meaning their book is that of God, in a sense<br>\
like that in which a house of worship is said to be<br>\
a house of God; for,] as some relate it, the phrase<br>\
used by En-Nábighah is مَحَلَّتُهُمْ ذَاتُ الإِلٰهِ, with<br>\
حاء, [i. e. their abode is in a peculiar manner that<br>\
of God,] meaning, their abode is one of pilgrimage<br>\
and of sacred sites. (S and TA in art. جل.) ―<br>\
-b15-<br>\
ذُو is sometimes redundant [in respect of meaning,<br>\
though governing as a prefixed n.]; and so is its<br>\
pl. (T, * TA.) Az says, (TA,) I have heard more<br>\
than one of the Arabs say, كُنَّا بِمَوْضِعِ كَذَا مَعَ<br>\
ذِى عَمْرٍو, i. e. We were in such a place with<br>\
Amr: (T, TA:) and كَانَ مَعَنَا ذُو عَمْرٍو, i. e.<br>\
&#39;Amr was with us: and أَتَيْنَا ذَا يَمَنٍ, meaning<br>\
أَتَيْنَا اليَمَنَ [We came to El-Yemen]. (T.) [See<br>\
an ex. similar to this last, and evidently belonging<br>\
to the present art., in the latter half of art. ذا.<br>\
And see لَا ذَا جَرَمَ and لَا أَنْ ذَا جَرَمَ and لَا عَنْ ذَا<br>\
جَرَمَ and لَا ذَا جَرَ (in which ذا is in like manner<br>\
redundant, as are also أَنْ and عَنْ, the latter of<br>\
which is a dial. var. of the former of them,) in<br>\
art. جرم: perhaps belonging to the present art.,<br>\
like أَتَيْنَا ذَايَمَنٍ; or perhaps to art. ذا. See also<br>\
what is said respecting ذُو prefixed to a proper<br>\
name in an early portion of this paragraph.] ―<br>\
-b16-<br>\
It is also used in the sense of اَلَّذِى, (T, S, M, K,)<br>\
in the dial. of Teiyi, (T, S, TA,) for the purpose<br>\
of qualifying a determinate noun (S, M, K) by<br>\
means of a proposition which it connects with<br>\
that noun: (M, K:) and when thus used, it<br>\
[generally] retains the same form when it denotes<br>\
a dual and a pl. (S, M, K) and a fem., (S,)<br>\
and exhibits no sign of case: (M, K:) you say,<br>\
أَنَا ذُو عَرَفْتُ [I who knew], and ذُو سَمِعْتُ [who<br>\
heard]; and هٰذِهِ المَرْأَةُ ذُو قَالَتْ كَذَا [This is the<br>\
woman who said such a thing: (S:) and أَتَانِى ذُو<br>\
قَالَ ذٰلِكَ [He who said that came to me]; and<br>\
أَتَانِى ذُو قَالَا ذٰلِكَ [They two who said that came<br>\
to me]; and أَتَانِ ذُو قَالُوا ذٰلِكَ [They who said<br>\
that came to me]. (M.) But Fr says, I heard<br>\
an Arab of the desert say, بِالفَضْلِ ذُو فَضَّلَكُمْ اللّٰهُ بِهِ<br>\
وَالكَرَامَةِ ذَاتُ أَكْرَمَكُمُ اللّٰهُ بِهَا [By the excellence<br>\
wherewith God hath made you to excel, and the<br>\
honour wherewith God hath honoured you]; thus<br>\
they use ذَاتُ in the place of اَلَّتِى, and they make<br>\
it to be with refa in every case: and they confuse<br>\
[numbers and genders] in speaking of a dual<br>\
number and a pl. number [and a fem.]; they<br>\
sometimes say, [for ex.,] in the case of the dual,<br>\
هٰذَانِ ذُو تَعْرِفُ and هَاتَانِ ذُو تَعْرِفُ [These two<br>\
whom, or which, thou knowest]; and a poet says,<br>\
[namely, Sinán Ibn-El-Fahl, of the tribe of Teiyi,<br>\
(Ham p. 292,)]<br>\
فَإِنَّ المَآءَ أَبِى وَجَدِّى<br>\
وَبِئْرِى ذُو حَفَرْتُ وَذُو طَوَيْتُ<br>\
[For verily the water is the water of my father<br>\
and my grandfather, and my well which I dug<br>\
and which I cased; making ذو to relate to a fem.<br>\
noun]: and some, he adds, use the dual and pl.<br>\
and fem. forms; thus they say, هٰذَانَ ذَوَا قَالَا ذَاكَ<br>\
[These two who said that], and هٰؤُلَآءِ ذَوُوا قَالُوا<br>\
[These who said], and هٰذِهِ ذَاتُ قَالَتْ [This<br>\
female who said]; and he cites the saying of<br>\
a poet,<br>\
جَمَعْتُهَا مِنْ أَيْنُقٍ سَوَابِقْ<br>\
ذَوَاتُ يَنْهَضْنَ بِغَيْرِ سَائِقْ<br>\
[I collected them from outstripping she-camels,<br>\
that rise and hasten in their pace without a<br>\
driver]; and the prov., أَتَى عَلَيْهِ ذُو أَتَى عَلَى<br>\
النَّاسِ, meaning الَّذِى أَتَى [i. e. What has come<br>\
upon men in general has come, or came, upon<br>\
him]. (T.) Accord. to the usage most in repute,<br>\
ذُو in this sense is indecl., and has no variation of<br>\
gender or number; but some decline it, like ذو<br>\
in the sense of صَاحِب, except that they make<br>\
ذَات and ذَوَات indecl., with damm for the termination, saying ذَاتُ and ذَوَاتُ in every case, if<br>\
they adopt the chaste mode; otherwise, in the<br>\
accus. and gen. cases, saying ذَاتِ, and in like<br>\
manner ذَوَاتِ (I&#39; Ak pp. 40 and 41.) ―<br>\
-b17-  They<br>\
said also, لَاأَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ بِذِى تَسْلَمُ (M, K) and<br>\
