and ↓ ذمّمهُ, (MA,) inf. n. تَذْمِيمٌ, (KL,) signifies<br>\
the same: (MA, KL:) [or this has an intensive<br>\

the saying, اِفْعَلْ كَذَا وخَلَاكَ ذَمٌّ, (T, S, K,) i. e.<br>\
خَلَا مِنْكَ ذَمٌّ, meaning [Do thou such a thing,<br>\
and] thou wilt not be blamed; (ISk, S, K;) or<br>\
thou wilt have an excuse; [lit.] blame will full<br>\
from thee: (S in art. خلو:) one should not say<br>\
خَلَاكَ ذَنْبٌ. (ISk, S in the present art.) ذُمَّ, also,<br>\
signifies He was satirized, particularly in verse.<br>\
(IAar, T.) And He was made to suffer loss or<br>\
diminution [app. in respect of his reputation].<br>\
(IAar, T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ذَمَّ المَكَانُ (tropical:)  The place was, or<br>\
became, affected with drought, or barrenness,<br>\
and its good things [or produce] became scanty.<br>\
(TA.) [But perhaps ذَمَّ is here a mistranscription for ذُمَّ; for] you say of a land, ذَمَّ مَرْعَاهَا<br>\
[He dispraised, or discommended, its pasture,<br>\
when its pasture is scanty]. (S and M and K in<br>\
art. بذأ.)<br>\

It flowed [with ذَمِيم, i. e. mucus]; (K;) like<br>\

though she made the people to blame her. (TA.)<br>\
And أَذَمَّتْ رِكَابُهُمْ (tropical:)  Their camels upon which<br>\
they were riding became jaded, and lagged behind,<br>\
(S, M, K, TA,) not keeping up with the main<br>\
body of camels; (S, TA;) [as though they made<br>\
their riders to blame them; or] as though [the<br>\
idea of] their strength in journeying were derived<br>\
from ذَمَّةٌ meaning “ a well having little water. ”<br>\
(TA.) And اذمّ بِهَ بَعِيرُهُ (tropical:)  [His camel became<br>\
jaded, and lagged behind with him]. (S, TA.)<br>\
And أَذَمَّتْ بِالرَّكْبِ, said of a she-ass, (tropical:)  She kept<br>\
back the company of riders upon camels by her<br>\
weakness and her ceasing to go on. (TA from<br>\

-A2-  اذمّهُ He found him, or it, to be such<br>\
as is blamed, dispraised, &amp;c.; (S, M, K, TA;)<br>\

تذمّم He shunned, or avoided, (T, * Mgh,)<br>\
or he preserved, or guarded, himself from, (MA,)<br>\
blame, dispraise, &amp;c.: (T, * MA, Mgh:) this is<br>\
the proper meaning; and hence, (Mgh,) he felt<br>\
disdain, or scorn, and shame. (S, MA, Mgh, K,<br>\
KL.) One says, لَوْ لَمْ أَتْرُكِ الكَذِبَ تَأَثُّمًا لَتَرَكْتُهُ<br>\
تَذَمُّمَا [If I did not refrain from lying for the<br>\

or refrained, from it to avoid blame, or through<br>\
disdain, or scorn, or shame; disdained, or scorned,<br>\
it; or was ashamed of it]. (K in art. حشم.)<br>\
And Aboo-&#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;Alà mentions his having<br>\
heard an Arab of the desert use the expression لا<br>\
يذمّون [app. ↓ لَا يُذِمُّونَ, for the ا in the measure<br>\
أَفْعَلَ sometimes has a privative property,] meaning They do not shun, or avoid, blame;<br>\
(لَا يَتَذَمَّمُونَ;) and are not affected with shame.<br>\
(TA.) It is said in a trad., مِنْ خِلَالِ المَكَارِمِ<br>\
التَّذَمُّمُ لِلصَّاحِبِ, meaning [Of the properties of<br>\
generous, or honourable, practices, is] the being<br>\
regardful of everything that is entitled to reverence, respect, honour, or defence, in the character<br>\
and appertenances of the companion, or friend,<br>\
and dispelling from oneself the blame that he would<br>\
incur from men if he were not regardful thereof.<br>\
(TA.) And one says, لِلْجَارِ عِنْدَكَ تَذَمُّمٌ and<br>\
↓ مُسْتَذَمٌّ [To the neighbour, with thee, is shown<br>\
regard of everything that is entitled to reverence,<br>\
respect, honour, or defence, in his character and<br>\
appertenances: مُسْتَذَمٌّ being app. an inf. n. of<br>\
↓ استذمّ, and this being syn. with تذمّم]. (TA.)<br>\

10<br>\
استذمّ [He required blame, &amp;c.; as though<br>\
he called for it; or] he was blamed, or dispraised,<br>\
&amp;c. (KL.) See also 4, second sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
see 5, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b3-  [استذمّ بِذِمَامِهِ is used by<br>\
post-classical writers, and is perhaps a classical<br>\
phrase, meaning He begged, or implored, his protection. See an instance in “ Abulfedæ Annales,”<br>\
vol. iii. p. 170.]<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
ذَمْذَمَ He made his gift small, or<br>\

(T, S, M, Mgh, K,) in which the latter word is<br>\
an epithet, (Mgh,) and ↓ ذِمَّةٌ also, with kesr, (so<br>\
in one of my copies of the S,) and ↓ ذَمِيمٌ, and<br>\
ذَمِيمَةٌ; (M, K;) A well containing little water;<br>\
(T, S, M, Mgh, K;) because discommended: (M,<br>\
Mgh:) and, (M, K,) as some say, (M,) containing much water: thus having two contr. significations: (M, K:) pl. ذِمَامٌ (T, S, M, K) and ↓ ذَمٌّ,<br>\
(T, TA,) [or rather the latter is a coll. gen. n., of<br>\
which ذَمَّةٌ is the n. un.] A poet says, (S,)<br>\
namely, Dhu-r-Rummeh, describing camels whose<br>\
eyes were sunk in their sockets by reason of<br>\
fatigue, (T,)<br>\
عَلَى حِمْيَرِيَّاتٍ كَأَنَّ عُيُونَهَا<br>\
ذِمَامُ الرَّكَايَا أَنْكَزَتْهَا المَوَاتِحُ<br>\

(T, S.)<br>\
ذِمَّةٌ A compact, a covenant, a contract, a<br>\
league, a treaty, an engagement, a bond, or an<br>\
obligation; (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) because<br>\
the breaking thereof necessitates blame: (Mgh:)<br>\
and a right, or due, (حَقٌّ,) for the neglect of<br>\
which one is to be blamed: (Bd in ix. 8:) [an<br>\
inviolable right or due:] and ↓ ذِمَامٌ and ↓ مَذِمَّةٌ<br>\
and ↓ مَذَمَّةٌ signify in like manner a compact, a<br>\
covenant, &amp;c. as above, for the neglect, or nonobservance, of which a man is to be blamed:<br>\
(Msb:) or these three words [in the CK the<br>\
first and last only] signify a right, or due; syn.<br>\
حَقٌّ: (M, K:) or so the first of them: (T, * S:)<br>\
and each of them, (M, K,) or the first of them,<br>\
i. e. ذِمَامٌ, (T, S, Mgh,) i. q. حُرْمَةٌ [which includes<br>\
all the significations of ذِمَّةٌ likewise, those above<br>\
and those which follow, but appears here to be<br>\
used as meaning especially a thing that should be<br>\
sacred, or inviolable; or which one is under an<br>\
obligation to reverence, respect, or honour, and<br>\
defend; everything that is entitled to reverence,<br>\
respect, honour, or defence. in the character and<br>\
appertenances of a person]; (S, M, Mgh, K;) every<br>\
حُرْمَة for the neglect, or non-observance, of which<br>\
one is to be blamed: (T:) ↓ ذَمَامَةٌ, also, and<br>\
↓ ذِمَامَةٌ, are syn. with حَقٌّ and حُرْمَةٌ: (TA:)<br>\
and ذِمَّةٌ signifies also i. q. أَمَانٌ [as meaning<br>\
security, or safety; security of life and property;<br>\
protection, or safeguard; a promise, or an assurance, of security, safety, protection, or safeguard;<br>\

TA;) and so ↓ ذِمَامٌ: (MA, KL: [explained in<br>\
both by the Pers. زِنْهَارْ; and in the latter by<br>\
حُرْمَةٌ and حَقٌّ also:]) and responsibility [for the<br>\
fulfilment of an obligation, for the payment of a<br>\
sum of money, for the restitution of a thing, or<br>\
for the safety, or safe-keeping, of a thing or<br>\
person]; suretiship; (M, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ ذَمَامَةٌ and ↓ ذِمَامَةٌ; (M, K; [in the former of<br>\
which, these two words are said to be syn. with<br>\
ذِمَّةٌ, app. meaning, in all the senses mentioned<br>\
above;]) and ↓ ذِمٌّ: (M, K: [said in the M to<br>\
be syn. with ذِمَّةٌ in the first only of the senses<br>\
mentioned above in this paragraph: in the CK,<br>\
والذِّمُّ is erroneously put for وَ الذِّمِّ:]) the pl. of<br>\
ذِمَّةٌ is ذِمَمٌ (T, Msb) and ذِمَامٌ: (T:) and the pl.<br>\
of ↓ ذِمَامٌ as [a sing.] syn. with [ذِمَّةٌ and] مَذَمَّةٌ<br>\
and مَذِمَّةٌ is أَذِمَّةٌ. (M, K.) Hence, i. e. from<br>\
ذِمَّةٌ in the first of the senses explained above,<br>\
أَهلُ الذِّمَّةِ, (S, Mgh, TA.) and الذِّمِّةُ, (T, M, *<br>\
Mgh, K, TA,) with the prefixed noun اهل suppressed, (TA,) The people with whom a compact,<br>\
or covenant, &amp;c., has been made; (T, S, M, K,<br>\
TA;) [and particularly] those, of the believers<br>\
in a plurality of Gods, [by which are here meant<br>\
the Christians, Jews, and Sabians, but no others,]<br>\
who pay the [tax called] جِزْيَة; (T, TA;) [i. e.<br>\
the free non-Muslim subjects of a Muslim government, who pay a poll-tax for which the Muslims<br>\
are responsible for their security and freedom<br>\
and toleration: see أَهْلٌ:] the appellation ↓ ذِمِّىٌّ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) a rel. n. from الذِّمَّةُ, (Msb;) is<br>\
applied to a person of this class; (Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
because he is rendered secure, or free from fear,<br>\
for his property and his blood, by means of the<br>\
جِزْيَة. (Mgh.) جَعَلَ عُمَرُ أَهْلَ السَّوَادِ ذِمَّةً means<br>\
&#39;Omar treated [lit. made] the people of the Sawád<br>\
as those who are termed أَهْلُ الذِّمَّةِ. (Mgh.) And<br>\
أَقْبِلْنَا بِذِمَّةٍ [or أَقْلِبْنَا?], in the prayer of the traveller,<br>\
means Restore us to our family in safety. (TA.) It<br>\
is related in a trad. of &#39;Alee, that he said, ذِمَّتِى بِمَا<br>\
أَقُولُ رَهِينَةٌ وَ أَنَا بِهِ زَعِيمٌ, meaning My responsibility is pledged for [the truth of] what I say,<br>\
and I am answerable for it; (Mgh, TA; *) i. e.<br>\
this my saying is true, and I am responsible for<br>\
it. (Mgh.) And it is said in another trad., فَقَدْ<br>\
بَرِئَتْ مِنْهُ الذِّمَّة [Then the responsibility of God<br>\
is clear, or quit, of him]; i. e. there is given to<br>\
every one, by God, a covenant whereby He<br>\
binds Himself to preserve and protect him; and<br>\
when he throws himself into destruction, or does<br>\
that which is unlawful for him to do, or acts at<br>\
variance with that which he is commanded to do,<br>\
the covenant of God fails to aid him. (TA.)<br>\
فِى ذِمَّتِى كَذَا means فى ضَمَانِى [virtually I am<br>\
responsible for such a thing; i. e. for paying it,<br>\
or restoring it, &amp;c.; but lit. in my responsibility<br>\
is such a thing; or on my responsibility rests, or<br>\
lies, or be, such a thing; for فى may be here<br>\
used, as it is in many other instances, in the<br>\
sense of عَلَى]: (Msb:) [or,] in the saying<br>\
ثَبَتَ فِى ذِمَّتِى كَذَا, [which means Such a thing<br>\
became, or has become, binding, obligatory, or<br>\
incumbent, on me,] the term ذِمَّة is applied to<br>\
designate [the moral sense considered as] the seat<br>\
[of the sense] of obligation to fulfil what is [properly] termed ذِمَّة [i. e. a compact, or covenant,<br>\
or the like]. (Mgh.) الرَّضَاعِ ↓ مَا يُذْهِبُ عَنِّى مَذِمَّةَ<br>\
(T, S, Mgh, *) or الرَّضَاعِ ↓ مَذَمَّةَ, (T, Mgh,) meaning [What will put away from me the obligation<br>\
of] the right, or due, of the woman who has<br>\
suckled for the sucking? is a question occurring<br>\
in a trad., (T, S, Mgh, *) as put by a man to the<br>\
Prophet: (T:) and the answer was, “A slave,<br>\
male or female: ” (T, S, Mgh:) En-Nakha&#39;ee<br>\
says, (S,) they liked, on the occasion of the weaning of a child, to give the woman who had<br>\
suckled it something beside the hire: (S, Mgh:)<br>\
↓ مَذَمَّةٌ in this case is a dial. var. of ↓ مَذِمَّةٌ:<br>\
(Mgh:) or, as IAth says, the former is from<br>\
الذَّمُّ; and the latter, from الذِّمَّهُ. (TA.) You<br>\
say also, الرَّضَاعِ بِشَّىْءٍ تُعْطِيهِ ↓ أَذْهِبْ عَنْكَ مَذَمَّ<br>\
الظِّئْرَ and الرَّضَاعِ ↓ مَذِمَّ, meaning [Put away from<br>\
thee the obligation of] the right, or due, that is<br>\
incumbent on thee to render her for the sucking<br>\
of thy child [by something that thou shalt give to<br>\
her who has suckled]. (T.) And أَذْهِبْ عَنْكَ<br>\
بِشَىْءٍ ↓ مَذِمَّتَهُمْ and ↓ مَذَمَّتَهُمْ, (T, and so accord. to<br>\
different copies of the S and K, in which عنك is<br>\
omitted,) مَذَمَّة being a dial. var., (T,) i. e. [Put<br>\
away from thee the obligation of their right, or<br>\
due, by something; meaning] feed them with<br>\
something, (T,) or give to them something, (S, K,)<br>\
for they have a right, or due. (T, S, K.) And<br>\
↓ قَضَى مَذِمَّتَهُ and ↓ مَذَمَّتَهُ [He paid his right,<br>\
or due;] meaning he did good to him, or conferred upon him a benefit or benefits, in order<br>\
that he might not be blamed. (M, K.) And رَجُلٌ<br>\

A man who has a right, or due,] meaning كَلٌّ<br>\
عَلَى النَّاسِ (tropical:)  [a man who is a burden upon people,<br>\
to be maintained, or supported, by them]. (M, K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
