6<br>\
تَذَاْيَلَ see 1, last sentence but one.<br>\
ذَيْلٌ The latter, or kinder, or the last, or kindmost, part of anything. (M, K.) Accord. to<br>\
MF, this is the proper signification, and the<br>\
other significations here following are tropical.<br>\
(TA.) [But in my opinion, the word in each of<br>\
the next two senses, or at least in the former of<br>\
them; if not strictly proper, is what is termed<br>\
حَقِيقَةٌ عُرْفِيَّةٌ, i. e. a word so much used in a<br>\
tropical sense as to be, in that sense, conventionally regarded as proper.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [A skirt, or lower<br>\
extremity, of a garment, reaching nearly, or<br>\
quite, to the ground, or that is dragged upon<br>\
the ground, when made to hang down:] the<br>\
extremity, of a garment, that is next the ground,<br>\
and so if not touching it [as well as if touching<br>\
it]; an inf. n. used in this sense: (Msb:) or the<br>\
part of a waist-wrapper (إِزَار), and of a garment<br>\
[of any kind], that is dragged [upon the ground],<br>\
(M, K,) when it is made to hang down: (M:)<br>\
or the part, of an إِزَار, and of a [garment of the<br>\
kind called] رِدَآء, that is made to hang down, and<br>\
touches the ground: and the part, of any kind of<br>\
garment worn by a woman, that the wearer drags<br>\
upon the ground behind her: (Lth, T:) or the<br>\
parts, all round, of a woman&#39;s garment, that fall<br>\
upon the ground: and the portion that is made<br>\
to hang down, of a woman&#39;s shift and of her<br>\
قِنَاع [or head-covering]: you do not [properly]<br>\
say of a man that he has a ذَيْل [but only when<br>\
you liken the lower part of his garment to the<br>\
similar part of a woman&#39;s garment]: a man&#39;s<br>\
having a long garment, such as a shirt and a<br>\
جُبَّة, [or his dragging the skirt thereof,] is termed<br>\
إِرْفَالٌ: (Khálid Ibn-Jembeh, T:) the pl. of ذَيْلٌ<br>\
(in this sense, T, Msb, as relating to a shirt [&amp;c.],<br>\
S, and in all its senses, T, M) is أَذْيَالٌ (T, S, M,<br>\
Msb, K) and أَذْيُلٌ (El-Hejeree, M, K) [both pls.<br>\
of pauc.] and ذُيُولٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) which is a<br>\
pl. of mult. (M.) Hence طُولُ الذَّيْلِ is a metonymical expression meaning (tropical:)  Richness, or<br>\
competency; because long أَذْيَال generally pertain<br>\
to the rich and the prodigal and the proud and<br>\
self-conceited: (Er-Rázee, Har p. 493:) and you<br>\
say, طَالَ ذَيْلُ فُلَانٍ, meaning (tropical:)  The state, or condition, of such a one became good, and his wealth<br>\
became abundant: and هُوَ طَوِيلُ الذَّيْلِ, meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  He is rich. (Har p. 319.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Of a horse (T,<br>\
K) &amp;c., (K,) [i. e.] of a horse and a camel and<br>\
the like, (M,) The tail: (T, M, K:) or the tail<br>\
when long: (TA:) or the part, of the tail, that is<br>\
made to hang down. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [(assumed tropical:)  Of a cloud,<br>\
The skirt; or lower, pendent, part: used in this<br>\
sense in the K voce هَيْدَبٌ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  ذَيْلُ الرِّيحِ (assumed tropical:)  What<br>\
is dragged along, (T, S, O,) or drawn together,<br>\
(M,) by the wind, upon the ground, (T, S, O, M,)<br>\
of dust (T, M, O) and rubbish: (T, O:) or what<br>\
the wind leaves upon the sand, (M, K,) in the<br>\
form of a rope, (M,) resembling the track of a<br>\
ذَيْل [or skirt] dragged along: (M, K:) or, as<br>\
some say, أَذْيَالُالرِّيحِ means (assumed tropical:)  the after-parts of<br>\
the wind, with which it sweeps what is light to it.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b6-  ذَيْلُ جَبَلٍ (assumed tropical:)  The foot, bottom, base, or<br>\
lowest part, of a mountain. (A and TA voce<br>\
جَرٌّ.) ―<br>\
-b7-  أَذْيَالُ النَّاسِ (assumed tropical:)  The hindmost of the people.<br>\
(K.) You say, جَآءَ أَذْيَالٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ (assumed tropical:)  Some few<br>\
of the hindmost of the people came. (S, Sgh.) ―<br>\

with an elegant and a proud and self-conceited<br>\
gait. (TA.) Applied to a horse, That carries<br>\

raising his fore legs together and putting them<br>\
down together, and kneading with his hind legs,<br>\
or in prancing, as though he dragged along the<br>\
ذَيْل [or pendent portion] of his tail. (M.)<br>\
ذَائِلٌ, applied to a horse, Having a ذَيْل, (T,<br>\
K,) i. e. tail: (T:) and ↓ ذَيَّالٌ having a long ذَيْل:<br>\
(T, K:) or the former word has the latter signification; (IKt, T, M;) it means having a long tail:<br>\
(S:) and ↓ the latter word, tall, and having a long<br>\
ذَيْل, (M, K,) and that carries himself in an<br>\
elegant and a proud and self-conceited manner, in<br>\
his step; (K;) and is applied in the same sense to a<br>\
wild bull: (M:) or the former word signifies short,<br>\
and having a long tail; and its fem. is with ة: (T:)<br>\
or when a horse is of this description, they say<br>\
الذَّنَبِ ↓ ذَيَّالُ, mentioning the ذَنَب. (T, S.) ―<br>\

Also, applied to a دِرْع, (S, M, K,) [i. e. a coat of<br>\
mail, as is shown in the S and TA,] Long (S, M,<br>\
K) in the ذَيْل [or shirt]; (S;) and so ذَائِلَةٌ and<br>\
↓ مُذَالَةٌ. (M, K. [In the CK, the last word is<br>\
erroneously written مَذَالَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And حَلْقَةٌ ذَائِلَةٌ<br>\
and ↓ مُذَالَةٌ A ring [app. of a coat of mail] that<br>\
is slender (M, K *) and elongated. (M.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
ذَائِلٌ ↓ ذَيْلٌ [an expression like ذُلٌّ ذَلِيلٌ, the<br>\
former word an inf. n.,] means [Exceeding] lowness, baseness, vileness, meanness, contemptibleness,<br>\

also means (assumed tropical:)  A female slave: (T, S, M:) because<br>\
she is held in low, or mean, estimation, while she<br>\

[More proud and self-conceited than a female<br>\
slave]. (S, K.)<br>\
