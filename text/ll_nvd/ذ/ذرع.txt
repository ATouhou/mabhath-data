the arm, or fore leg: (S, TA:) [or rather, when<br>\
said of a man, the fore arm; and of a beast, the<br>\
arm; though the whole arm of a man is generally<br>\
stretched forth with his fore arm, and the whole<br>\
fore leg of a beast with his arm: and ↓ تَذْرِيعٌ<br>\
and ↓ إِذْرَاعٌ and ↓ تَذَرُّعٌ signify the same, as will<br>\
be shown by explanations of their verbs.] You<br>\

signifies, simply, he strangled, or throttled, him;<br>\
(S, L;) but more properly, he put his neck between<br>\
his fore arm and neck and upper arm, and so<br>\
strangled, or throttled, him; and لَهُ ↓ ذرّع, also,<br>\

K,) inf. n. as above, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád,) (tropical:)  He made<br>\
intercession with him. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.) [Said<br>\
in the TA to be tropical; I suppose because the<br>\

الأَمِيرِ (tropical:)  I made intercession for such a one with<br>\

-b2-  (tropical:)  He exceeded the due bounds, or<br>\

it has originated from the stretching forth of the<br>\
fore arm; for he who talks much sometimes does<br>\
that; and ISd says the like. (TA.) ―<br>\

مِنْ تَحْتِ الجُبَّةِ and ↓ اِذَّرَعَهُمَا, He put forth,<br>\

being of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ; (Mgh, K;) like<br>\
اِذَّكَرَ, (TA,) or اِدَّكَرَ, (Mgh,) from الذِّكْرُ: (Mgh,<br>\
TA:) the former accord. to one relation, the<br>\
latter accord. to another, occurring in a trad.<br>\
(Mgh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اذرع also signifies He seized with<br>\
the fore arm. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  مَا أَذْرَعَهَا [How long, or<br>\
large, is she in the fore arm!] is [from الذِّرَاعُ,<br>\

-b2-  and see<br>\
also 4. ―<br>\
-b3-  تَذَرُّعٌ also signifies The measuring a<br>\
thing with the fore arm. (S, K.) [See also 1.] A<br>\
poet says, (S,) namely Keys Ibn-El-Khateem<br>\
El-Ansáree, (TA,)<br>\
تَرَى قِصَدَ المُرَّانِ تُلْقَى كَأَنَّهَا<br>\
تَذَرُّعُ خِرْصَانٍ بِأَيْدِىالشَّوَاطِبِ<br>\
[Thou seest the fragments of the hard and pliant<br>\
spears thrown as though they were what is seen<br>\
in the measuring, with the fore arm, of rods of<br>\
palm-sticks in the hands of the females who pare<br>\
them]: (S, TA:) or, accord. to As, تَذَرَّعَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
الجَرِيدَ signifies Such a one put the palm-sticks<br>\
upon his fore arm, and pared them: and خِرْصَانٌ<br>\
means, originally, rods of palm-sticks: and<br>\
شَوَاطِبُ is pl. of شَاطِبَةٌ; meaning a woman who<br>\
peels the عَسِيب, and then throws it to the مُنَقِّيَة,<br>\
who removes all that is upon it with her knife<br>\
until she has left it slender, when she throws it<br>\
back to the شاطبة. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, The splitting<br>\
(تَشَقُّق [which is intrans., but I think it is a<br>\
mistake for تَشْقِيق, which is trans.,]) of a thing<br>\
into several oblong pieces of the measure of the<br>\
cubit in length. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  تَذَرَّعَتِ المَرْأَةُ<br>\
The woman split palm-leaves to make of them a<br>\
mat. (IDrd, K.) Thus some explain the saying<br>\
of Ibn-El-Khateem, quoted above. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
تَذَرَّعَتِ الإِبِلُ الكَرَعَ The camels came to drink of<br>\
the rain-water and waded in it with their arms.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
-A2-  تذرّع بِذَرِيعَةٍ (tropical:)  He obtained, or sought to<br>\
obtain, access, or intimacy; or he ingratiated<br>\
himself, or sought to ingratiate himself; by a<br>\
means of doing so. (S, K, TA.) You say, also,<br>\
تذرّع إِلَيْهِ (tropical:)  He obtained, or sought to obtain,<br>\
access to him; &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِذَّرَعَ or إِدَّرَعَ: see 4.<br>\
10<br>\
استذرع بِهِ He concealed, or protected, himself by it, (namely a thing, TA,) and made it a<br>\
ذَرِيعَة [q. v.] for him. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
ذَرْعٌ, in its primary acceptation, has the signification explained in the first sentence of this<br>\
article. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, it is used in the<br>\
sense of] (tropical:)  Power, or ability; as also ↓ ذِرَاعٌ; (TA;)<br>\
or a man&#39;s reach, or extent of power or ability.<br>\
(Msb.) And hence the phrases, ضَاقَ بِالأَمْرِ ذَرْعُهُ,<br>\
and ↓ ذِرَاعُهُ, (K,) and ضَاقَ بِالأَمْرِ ذَرْعًا, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) in which the last word is in the accus. case<br>\
as an explicative, for the original form of the<br>\
phrase is that first mentioned, (TA,) and sometimes they said ↓ ذِرَاعًا, (S, TA,) (tropical:)  He was unable<br>\
to do, or accomplish, the thing, or affair; as<br>\
though meaning, he stretched forth his arm to it<br>\
and it did not reach it; (S, TA; *) or these phrases<br>\
are thus used because he who is short in the fore<br>\
arm will not reach that which he who is long<br>\
therein reaches, nor will the power of the former<br>\
equal that of the latter; therefore they are proverbially applied to him whose power falls short<br>\
of the attainment, or accomplishment, of an affair:<br>\
(TA:) or he lacked strength, or power, or ability,<br>\
to do, or accomplish, the thing, or affair, and<br>\
found not any way of escape from what was<br>\
disagreeable therein: (K:) or he was unable to<br>\
bear, or endure, or undertake, the thing, or affair.<br>\
(Msb.) You say also, مَا لِى بِهِ ذَرْعٌ, and ↓ ذِرَاعٌ,<br>\
(tropical:)  I have not power, or ability, to do it. (TA.)<br>\
And كَسَرَ ذٰلِكَ مِنْ ذَرْعِى (tropical:)  That disabled, hindered, prevented, or withheld, me from doing that<br>\
which I desired. (TA.) And اِقْصِدْ بِذَرْعِكَ<br>\
(tropical:)  Deal thou gently with thyself; moderate thyself<br>\
restrain thyself; i. q. اِرْبَعْ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ; (S, TA;)<br>\
and let not thy soul, or mind, carry thee beyond<br>\
thy measure or extent [of power or ability].<br>\
(TA.) And أَبْطَرْتُ فُلَانًا ذَرْعهُ (tropical:)  I imposed upon<br>\
such a one more than he was able to do: (S, TA:)<br>\
but ذَرْعٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  the body: and [accord. to<br>\
IAar] أَبَطَرَنِى ذَرْعِى means (tropical:)  He wasted my body,<br>\
and cut off my means of subsistence. (TA.)<br>\
[See also art. بطر.] You likewise say, رَجُلٌ<br>\
↓ رَحْبُ الذِّرَاعِ [and الذَّرْعِ] (tropical:)  A man having ample<br>\
strength, and power, and might in war or fight,<br>\
courage, valour, or prowess. (TA. [See also<br>\
رَحْبٌ.]) And ضَعِيفُ الذَّرْعِ (tropical:)  Impotent. (KL.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, فُلَانٌ خَالِى الذَّرْعِ (tropical:)  Such a one<br>\
has his heart devoid of anxieties, or solicitudes,<br>\
and griefs; because the heart is sometimes one of<br>\
the seats of power: or it may mean, agreeably<br>\
with the original signification of ذَرْعٌ, such a one<br>\
is free from the causes of occupation which require the stretching forth of the fore arm and<br>\
extending of the hand. (Har p. 131.) And<br>\
رَجُلٌ وَاسِعٌ الذَّرْعِ, and ↓ الذِّرَاعِ, (tropical:)  A man large, or<br>\
liberal, in disposition. (K.) And كَبُرَ فِى ذَرْعِى<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Its occurrence, or befalling, was of great moment, momentous, grievous, or distressing, to<br>\
me. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  ذَرْعٌ also signifies The measure of<br>\
anything: and نَخْلَةٌ ذَرْعُ رَجَلٍ, A palm-tree of the<br>\
measure of the stature of a man. (TA.)<br>\
ذَرَعٌ A coveting; desiring eagerly; or lusting.<br>\
(S, K.) [Perhaps an inf. n. of which the verb is<br>\
ذَرِعَ.]<br>\
-A2-  See also ذَرِيعَةٌ.<br>\
ذَرِعٌ: see ذَرِيعٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  That journeys by night and by day. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  Longtongued with evil speech. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  (assumed tropical:)  Good in<br>\
social, or familiar, intercourse. (K, TA.)<br>\
ذُرْعَةٌ: see ذَرِيعَةٌ.<br>\
ذَرَاعٌ (S, K) and ↓ ذِرَاعٌ (ISd, K) (assumed tropical:)  A woman<br>\
(S) light, or active, with the hands in spinning:<br>\
(S, K:) or one who spins much; who has ability<br>\
to do so. (TA.)<br>\
ذِرَاعٌ, of a man, (Msb,) [The part] from the<br>\
elbow to the extremities of the fingers; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) the fore arm; syn. سَاعِدٌ [q. v.; thus<br>\
corresponding to the سَاق of the leg]: (Lth, K:)<br>\
and (tropical:)  [the space] from the extremity of the elbow<br>\
to the extremity of the middle finger: (M, Mgh, *<br>\
K: [in the last of which, the space is plainly<br>\
shown to be meant, like as the part is shown in<br>\
the Msb to be meant in the explanation cited<br>\
above from that work and the Mgh: see also<br>\
جَرِيبٌ:]) in both these senses, sometimes masc.,<br>\
(K,) accord. to Kh: (TA:) J says, (TA,) as<br>\
relating to the arm, it is masc. and fem.; but Sb<br>\
says that it is fem.: (S, TA:) [Mtr says,] it is<br>\
fem.: (Mgh:) [Fei says,] the measure so called<br>\
is in most instances fem.: accord. to ISk, it is<br>\
fem.; but some of the Arabs make it masc.: Fr<br>\
says that it is fem.; but that some of [the tribe<br>\
named] &#39;Okl make it masc.: As did not know an<br>\
instance of its being masc.: and Zj says that such<br>\
an instance is extr.; not choice: (Msb:) the<br>\
measure thus called, [i. e. the cubit,] (Msb,) the<br>\
ذِرَاعٌ مُكَسَّرَة [or cubit which is divided into fractions], (Mgh,) is six قَبَضَات [or fists] (Mgh,<br>\
Msb) of middling measure; (Msb;) and this is<br>\
called ذِرَاعُ العَمَامَّةِ [the cubit of the common people,<br>\
or the common cubit], because it wants one قَبْضَة<br>\
[or fist] of what is called ذِرَاعُ المَلِكِ [the cubit of<br>\
the king], namely one of the Kisràs, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
not the last of them, whose ذراع was seven قَبَضَات:<br>\
(Mgh:) [see also مِيلٌ: it is also an astronomical<br>\
measure; and as such, it seems, from several<br>\
instances in which it is mentioned by Kzw and<br>\
other writers, to be, probably, by rule, two<br>\
degrees; nearly the half, or quarter, of the length<br>\
assigned in different instances to the measure termed<br>\
رُمْحٌ; but, like the latter, not precise nor uniform<br>\
in every instance:] the dim. is ↓ ذُرِيَّعَةٌ, with ة<br>\
because it is fem.; (TA;) or ↓ ذُرَيْعٌ [or ↓ ذُرَيِّعٌ,<br>\
without ة, accord. to those who make it masc.]:<br>\
(L voce حَرْبٌ:) the pl. is أَذْرُعٌ and ذُرْعَانٌ; (O,<br>\
Msb, K;) or, accord. to Sb, the former only;<br>\
(S, Msb;) and Sb adds, they have given it this<br>\
form of pl. because it is fem.; meaning, that<br>\
فِعَالٌ and فُعَالٌ and فَعِيلٌ, when fem., have the pl.<br>\
of the measure أَفْعُلٌ. (TA.) In the phrase<br>\
الثَّوْبُ سَبْعٌ فِى ثَمَانِيَةٍ [The garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth, is seven cubits by eight spans], they say<br>\
سبع because أَذْرُع is fem., and ثمانية because أَشْبَار<br>\
is masc.; (S; [and the like is said in the Mgh;])<br>\
and because the length is measured by the ذراع,<br>\
and the breadth by the شِبْر. (S in art. ثمن.)<br>\
ذِرَاعٌ is also used as an epithet, applied to a masc.<br>\
n.: thus they say, هٰذَا ثَوْبٌ ذِرَاعٌ [This is a garment, or piece of cloth, a cubit in length]. (Kh.)<br>\
You say also, هُوَ مِنِّى عَلَى حَبْلِ الذِّرَاعِ It is<br>\
prepared, or made ready, on my part: (S:) and<br>\
هُوَ لَكَ عَلَى حَبْلِ الذِّرَاعِ I will pay it to thee in<br>\
ready money: or it is prepared, or made ready,<br>\
for thee: the حبل being a certain vein in the<br>\
ذراع. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence several tropical significations:] see ذَرْعٌ, in six places: and see also ذَرَاعٌ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Hence also, (Z, TA,) (tropical:)  The instrument with<br>\
which one measures the length of the ذراع [or<br>\
cubit], (S, Z, O, Mgh, K,) made of a piece of<br>\
wood, (Mgh,) or whether it be iron or a rod of<br>\
wood. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence also,] (assumed tropical:)  A sleeve: as in<br>\
the phrase ثَوْبٌ مُوَشَّى الذِّرَاعِ (assumed tropical:)  [a garment, or<br>\
piece of cloth, variegated, or figured, in the<br>\
sleeve]: pl. ↓ مَذَارِعُ, a pl. not agreeing with its<br>\
sing., like مَلَامِحُ and مَحَاسِنُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Of the<br>\
fore legs of bulls or cows, and of sheep or goats,<br>\
[The arm; i. e.] the part above the كُرَاع: and of<br>\
the fore legs of camels and horses and mules and<br>\
asses, [likewise the arm; i. e.] the part above<br>\
the وَظِيف: (K:) [also the arm-bone of any of the<br>\
animals here mentioned:] accord. to Lth, (TA,)<br>\
of any animal, [but this is by synecdoche, (assumed tropical:)  the<br>\
fore leg;] i. q. يَدٌ; (Msb, TA;) applying to the<br>\
whole of whatever is called thus: (TA:) [thus,<br>\
again, corresponding to سَاقٌ; this latter term, in<br>\
like manner, having a proper and a synecdochical<br>\
acceptation. Hence the prov.] لَا تُطْعِمِ العَبْدَ<br>\
الكُرَاعَ فَيَطْمَعَ فِى الذِّرَاعِ [Feed not thou the slave<br>\
with the shank, lest he covet the arm]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
[Hence,] الذِّرَاعُ, also called ذِرَاعُ الأَسَد (assumed tropical:)  Two<br>\
bright stars, which are one of the Mansions of the<br>\
Moon: (S:) [there are two asterisms thus called;<br>\
together, الذِّرَعَانِ: one of them is] الذِّرَاعُ المَبْسُوطَةُ,<br>\
[also called ذِرَاعُ الأَسَدِ المَبْسُوطَةُ,] the two bright<br>\
stars [<br>\
α and<br>\
β] in the heads of Gemini: (Kzw in<br>\
his description of Gemini:) [the other is called<br>\
الذِّرَاعُ المَقْبُوضَةُ, and] ذِرَاعُ الأَسَدِ المَقْبُوضَةُ, the<br>\
two bright stars [<br>\
α and<br>\
β] of Canis Minor:<br>\
(Kzw in his description of Canis Minor:) [hence<br>\
it appears that the ancient Arabs, or many of<br>\
them, extended the figure of Leo (as they did<br>\
also that of Scorpio) far beyond the limits which<br>\
we assign to it: the former ذراع accord. to those<br>\
who make النَّوْءُ to signify “ the auroral rising,”<br>\
but the latter accord. to those who make it to<br>\
signify “ the auroral setting,” is the Seventh<br>\
Mansion of the Moon: the following descriptions<br>\
in Kzw&#39;s account of the Mansions of the Moon,<br>\
and in the O and K and TA, are obscure and<br>\
inaccurate:] الذِّرَاعُ is one of the Mansions of the<br>\
Moon, (O, Kzw, K,) and is called ذراع الاسد<br>\
المقبوضة, (O, Kzw,) or ذراع الاسد المبسوطة:<br>\
(K:) the lion has a ذراع which is مبسوطة and a<br>\
ذراع which is مقبوضة, (O, Kzw, K,) and this is<br>\
the one next to Syria, (O, K,) or on the left,<br>\
(Kzw,) and in it the moon has a mansion; the<br>\
مبسوطة being next to El-Yemen, (O, K,) or on<br>\
the right; (Kzw;) [but this description of their<br>\
relative positions should be reversed, as is shown<br>\
by what precedes and by what follows;] each<br>\
being two stars, between which is the measure of<br>\
a سَوْط [or whip]; (O;) and the latter is higher<br>\
in the sky, and more extended, than the other,<br>\
(O, K,) wherefore it is called مبسوطة; (O;) and<br>\
sometimes the moon deviates, and so has a mansion<br>\
in it: (O, K:) [it is said in the TA that الذراع is<br>\
also a name of one of the asterisms (نُجُوم) of<br>\
الجَوْزَآء; but this is the same that is called the<br>\
مبسوطة:] it rises [at dawn] on the fourth of تَمُّوز<br>\
[or July O. S.], and sets [at dawn] on the fourth<br>\
of كَانُون الآخِر [or January, O. S.]: (O, Kzw:<br>\
[and so in the K, except that in this last, it is<br>\
erroneously said to set in كَانُون الأَوَّل:]) so says<br>\
IKt: but Ibráheem El-Harbee says that it rises on<br>\
the seventh of تمّوز, and sets on the sixth of كانون<br>\
الآخر. (O, TA.) [See مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل;<br>\
and see also نَوْءٌ, and نَكْبَآءُ.] The rhyming prosaist<br>\
of the Arabs says, إِذَا طَلَعَتِ الذِّرَاعْ حَسَرَتِ الشَّمْسُ<br>\
القِنَاعْ وَاسْتَعْلَتْ فِى الأُفُقِ الشُّعَاعْ وَ تَرَقْرَقَ السَّرَابُ فِى<br>\
كُلِّ قَاعْ [When the Dhiráa rises at dawn, the<br>\
sun puts off the veil, and the rays ascend in the<br>\
horizon, and the mirage flickers, or glistens, in<br>\
every plain]. (TA.) And the Arabs assert that<br>\
when there is no rain [at any other season] in the<br>\
year, the ذراع does not break its promise, though<br>\
it be but a بَغْشَة [or weak shower of rain]: (Kzw,<br>\
TA:) [or] its نَوْء is approved, and seldom does it<br>\
break its promise. (Kzw.) ―<br>\
