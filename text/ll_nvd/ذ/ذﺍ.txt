load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'ذاذَا is said by Aboo-&#39;Alee to be originally ذَىْ;<br>\
the ى, though quiescent, being changed into ا:<br>\
(M:) or it is originally ذَيَى or ذَوَى; the final<br>\
radical letter being elided: some say that the<br>\
original medial radical letter is ى because it has<br>\
been heard to be pronounced with imáleh [and so<br>\
it is now pronounced in Egypt]; but others say<br>\
that it is و, and this is the more agreeable with<br>\
analogy. (Msb.) It is a noun of indication,<br>\
[properly meaning This, but sometimes, when<br>\
repeated, better rendered that,] relating to an<br>\
object of the masc. gender, (S, M, K,) such as is<br>\
near: (I&#39;Ak p. 36:) or it relates to what is<br>\
distant [accord. to some, and therefore should<br>\
always be rendered that]; and هٰذَا, [which see in<br>\
what follows,] to what is near: (K in art. هَا:<br>\
[but the former is generally held to relate to what<br>\
is near, like the latter:]) or it is a noun denoting<br>\
anything indicated that is seen by the speaker<br>\
and the person addressed: the noun in it is ذَ, or<br>\
ذ alone: and it is a noun of which the signification<br>\
is vague and unknown until it is explained by<br>\
what follows it, as when you say ذَا الرَّجُلُ [This<br>\
man], and ذَا الفَرَسَ [This horse]: and the nom.<br>\
and accus. and gen. are all alike: (T:) the<br>\
fem. is ذِى (T, S, M, K, but omitted in the CK)<br>\
and ذِهْ, (S, M, K, but omitted in the CK,) the<br>\
latter used in the case of a pause, (S,) with a<br>\
quiescent ه, which is a substitute for the ى, not a<br>\
sign of the fem. gender, (S, M,) as it is in طَلْحَهْ<br>\
and حَمْزَهْ, in which it is changed into ة when<br>\
followed by a conjunctive alif, for in this case the<br>\
ه in ذِه remains unchanged [but is meksoorah, as<br>\
it is also in other cases of connexion with a<br>\
following word]; and one says also ذهِى; (M;)<br>\
and تَا and تِهْ: (S and K &amp;c. in art. تا:) for the<br>\
dual you say ذَانِ and تَانِ; (M;) ذَانِ is the dual<br>\
form of ذَا (T, S) [and تَانِ is that of تَا used in the<br>\
place of ذِى]; i. e., you indicate the masc. dual<br>\
by ذَانِ in the nom. case, and ذَيْنِ in the accus.<br>\
and gen.; and the fem. dual you indicate by تَانِ<br>\
in the nom. case, and تَيْنِ in the accus. and gen.:<br>\
(I&#39;Ak p. 36:) the pl. is أُلَآءِ [or أُلَآءِ] (T, S, and<br>\
I&#39;Ak ib.) in the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz,<br>\
(I&#39;Ak,) and أُولَى [or أُلَى] (T, I&#39;Ak) in the dial.<br>\
of Temeem; each both masc. and fem. (I&#39;Ak ib.<br>\
[See art. الى.]) You say, ذَا أَخُوكَ [This is thy<br>\
brother]: and ذِىأُخْتُكَ [This is thy sister]: (T:)<br>\
and لَاآتِيكَ فِى ذِى السَّنَةِ [I will not come to thee<br>\
in this year]; like as you say فى هٰذِهِ السَّنَةِ and<br>\
فى هٰذِى السَّنَةِ; not فى ذَا السَّنَةِ, because ذا is<br>\
always masc. (As, T.) And you say, ذَانِ أَخَوَاكَ<br>\
[These two are thy two brothers]: and تَانِ أُخْتَاكَ<br>\
[These two are thy two sisters]. (T.) And<br>\
أُولَآءِ إِخْوَتُكَ [These are thy brothers]: and أُولَآءِ<br>\
أَخَوَاتُكَ [These are thy sisters]: thus making no<br>\
difference between the masc. and the fem. in the<br>\
pl. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The هَا that is used to give notice, to<br>\
a person addressed, of something about to be said<br>\
to him, is prefixed to ذَا [and to ذِى &amp;c.], (T, S,<br>\
M, K,) and is a particle without any meaning but<br>\
inception: (T:) thus you say هٰذَا, (T, S, M,) and<br>\
some say هٰذَاا, adding another ا; (Ks, T;) fem.<br>\
هٰذِى, (T, S, M,) and [more commonly] هٰذِهْ in<br>\
the case of a pause, (M,) and هٰذِهِ in other cases,<br>\
(T, S,) and هَاتَا, and some say هٰذَاتِ, but this is<br>\
unusual and disapproved: (T:) dual هٰذَانِ for the<br>\
masc., and هَاتَانِ for the fem.; (T;) said by IJ<br>\
to be not properly duals, but nouns formed to<br>\
denote duals; (M;) and many of the Arabs say<br>\
هٰذَانِّ; (T;) some, also, make هٰذَانِ indecl., like<br>\
the sing. ذَا, reading [in the Kur xx. 66] إِنَّ هٰذَانِ<br>\
لَسَاحِرَانِ [Verily these two are enchanters], and it<br>\
has been said that this is of the dial. of Belhárith<br>\
[or Benu-l-Hárith] Ibn-Kaab; but others make it<br>\
decl., reading إِنَّ هٰذَايْنِ لَسَاحِرَانِ: (S, TA: [see,<br>\
however, what has been said respecting this<br>\
phrase voce إِنَّ:]) the pl. is هٰؤُلَا in the dial. of<br>\
Temeem, with a quiescent ا; and هٰؤُلَآءِ in the<br>\
dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, with medd and<br>\
hemz and khafd; and هٰؤُلَآءٍ in the dial. of Benoo-<br>\
&#39;Okeyl, with medd and hemz and tenween.<br>\
(AZ, T.) The Arabs also say, لَا هَا اللّٰهِ ذَا, introducing the name of God between هَا and ذَا;<br>\
meaning No, by God; this is [my oath, or] that<br>\
by which I swear. (T.) In the following verse,<br>\
of Jemeel,<br>\
وَأَتَى صَوَاحِبُهَا فَقُلْنَ هٰذَا الَّذِى<br>\
مَنَحَ المَوَدَّةَ غَيْرَنَا وَجَفَانَا<br>\
[it is said that] هَذَا is for أَذَا, (M,) i. e., ه is here<br>\
substituted for the interrogative hemzeh (S * and<br>\
K in art. ها) [so that the meaning is, And her<br>\
female companions came, and said, Is this he who<br>\
gave love to other than us, and treated us unkindly?]: or, as some assert, هَذَا is here used for<br>\
هٰذَا, the ا being suppressed for the sake of the<br>\
measure. (El-Bedr El-Karáfee, TA in art. ها.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  One says also ذَاكَ, (T, S, M, K,) affixing to ذَا<br>\
the ك of allocution, [q. v., meaning That,] relating<br>\
to an object that is distant, (T, *, S, and I&#39;Ak<br>\
p. 36,) or, accord. to general opinion, to that which<br>\
occupies a middle place between the near and the<br>\
distant, (I&#39;Ak pp. 36 and 37,) and this ك has no<br>\
place in desinential syntax; (S, and I&#39;Ak p. 36;)<br>\
it does not occupy the place of a gen. nor of an<br>\
accus., but is only affixed to ذا to denote the<br>\
distance of ذا from the person addressed: (T:)<br>\
for the fem. you say تِيكَ (T, S) and تَاكَ; (S and<br>\
K in art. تا, q. v.;) but not ذِيكَ, for this is wrong,<br>\
(T, S,) and is used only by the vulgar: (T:) for<br>\
the dual you say ذَانِكَ (T, S) and ذَيْنِكَ, as in the<br>\
phrases جَآءَنِى ذَانِكَ الرَّجُلَانِ [Those two men<br>\
came to me] and رَأَيْتُ ذَيْنُكَ الرَّجُلَيْنِ, [I saw those<br>\
two men]; (S;) and some say ذَانِّكَ, with teshdeed,<br>\
(T, S,) [accord. to J] for the purpose of corroboration, and to add to the letters of the noun, (S,)<br>\
but [accord. to others] this is dual of ذٰلِكَ, [which<br>\
see in what follows,] the second ن being a<br>\
substitute for the ل; (T on the authority of Zj<br>\
and others;) and some say تَانِّكَ also, with tesh-deed, (T, S,) as well as تَانِكَ: (T in this art., and<br>\
S and K in art. تا, but there omitted in some<br>\
copies of the S:) the pl. is [أُولَاكَ and] أُولٰئِكَ.<br>\
(T, S.) هَا is also prefixed to ذَاكَ; so that you say,<br>\
هٰذَاكَ زَيْدٌ [That is Zeyd]: (S, TA:) and in like<br>\
manner, for the fem., you say هَاتِيكَ and هَاتَاكَ:<br>\
(S and K in art. تا:) but it is not prefixed [to the<br>\
dual nor] to أُولٰئِكَ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  You also add ل in<br>\
ذَاكَ, (T, S, M, K,) as a corroborative; (TA;)<br>\
so that you say ذٰلِكَ, [meaning That,] (T, S, M,<br>\
K,) relating to an object that is distant, by common consent; (I&#39;Ak pp. 36 and 37;) or hemzeh,<br>\
saying ذَائِكَ, (K,) but some say that this is a<br>\
mispronunciation: (TA in art. ذوى:) for the fem.<br>\
you say تِلْكَ and تَالِكَ: the dual of ذٰلِكَ is ذَانِّكَ,<br>\
mentioned above; and that of the fem. is ثَانِّكَ:<br>\
(T: [and in the K in art. تا, تَالِكَ is also mentioned as a dual, as well as a sing.:]) and the pl.<br>\
is أُولَالِكَ. (S and M and K voce أُولَى or أُلَى or<br>\
أُلَا. [See art. الى.]) هَا is not prefixed to ذٰلِكَ<br>\
(S) nor to تِلْكَ [nor to أُولَالِكَ] because, as IB<br>\
says, the ل denotes the remoteness of that which<br>\
is indicated and the ها denotes its nearness, so that<br>\
the two are incompatible. (TA in art. تا.) ―<br>\
-b5-  In<br>\
the saying in the Kur [ii. 256, the Verse of the<br>\
Throne], مَنْ ذَا الَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ, (T,<br>\
TA,) accord. to Th and Mbr, (TA,) هٰذَا is syn.<br>\
with ذا [so that the meaning is, Who is this<br>\
that shall intercede with Him but by his permission?]: (T, TA:) or it may be here redundant<br>\
[so that the meaning is, Who is he that &amp;c.?].<br>\
(Kull.) ―<br>\
-b6-  It is sometimes syn. with اَلَّذِى. (T,<br>\
S, M.) So in the saying, مَا ذَا رَأَيْتَ [What is it<br>\
that thou sawest?]; to which one may answer,<br>\
مَتَاعٌ حَسَنٌ [A goodly commodity]. (Sb, S.) And<br>\
so in the Kur [ii. 216], وَ يَسْأَلُونَكَ مَا مَا ذَا يُنْفِقُونَ<br>\
[And they ask thee what amount of their property<br>\
is it that they shall expend in alms]; (T, M, TA;)<br>\
accord. to those who make the reply to be in the<br>\
nom. case; for this shows that ما is [virtually] in<br>\
the nom. case as an inchoative, and ذا is its<br>\
enunciative, and ينفقون is the complement of ذا;<br>\
and that ما and ذا are not to be regarded as one<br>\
word: [or] this is the preferable way of explanation<br>\
in the opinion of Sb, though he allowed the other<br>\
way, [that of regarding ما and ذا as one word,<br>\
together constituting an inchoative, and ينفقون<br>\
as its enunciative, (see Ham p. 521,)] with [the<br>\
reply in] the nom. case: (M:) and هٰذَا, also, is<br>\
used in the same sense: (TA:) so too ذا in<br>\
مَا ذَا هُوَ and مَنْ ذَا هُوَ may be considered as syn.<br>\
with الذى; but it is preferable to regard it as<br>\
redundant. (Kull.) ―<br>\
-b7-  It is [said to be] redundant<br>\
also in other instances: for ex., in the trad. of<br>\
Jereer, as related by Aboo-&#39;Amr Ez-Záhid, who<br>\
says that it is so in this instance: يَطْلُعُ عَلَيْكُمْ<br>\
رَجُلٌ مِنْ ذِى يَمَنٍ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ مَسْحَةٌ مِنْ ذِى مُلْكٍ<br>\
[There will come to you a man from El-Yemen,<br>\
having upon his face an indication of dominion].<br>\
(TA. [But this evidently belongs to art. ذُو; in<br>\
which see a similar ex. (أَتَيْنَا ذَا يَمَنٍ). See also<br>\
other exs. there.]) ―<br>\
-b8-  [كَذَا lit. means Like this:<br>\
and hence, thus: as also هٰكَذَا. ―<br>\
-b9-  It is also often<br>\
used as one word, and, as such, is made the complement of a prefixed noun; as in سَنَةَ كَذَا and<br>\
فِى سَنَةِ كَذَا In such a year. See also art. كَذَا:<br>\
and see the letter ك.] ―<br>\
-b10-  هٰذَا is sometimes used to<br>\
express contempt, and mean estimation; as in the<br>\
saying of &#39;Áïsheh respecting &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Amr Ibn-&#39;Abbás, يَا عَجَبًا لِابْنِ عَمْرٍو هٰذَا [O<br>\
wonder (meaning how I wonder) at Ibn-&#39;Amr,<br>\
this fellow!]. (Kitáb el-Miftáh, cited in De<br>\
Sacy&#39;s “ Gram. Ar.,” 2nd ed., i. 442.) [يَا هٰذَا<br>\
often occurs as addressed to one who is held in<br>\
mean estimation: it is like the Greek<br>\
ὦ οὗτο�, and<br>\
virtually like the vulgar Arabic expression يَا أَنْتَ,<br>\
and the Latin heus tu; agreeably with which it<br>\
may be rendered O thou; meaning O thou fellow;<br>\
an appellation denoting mean estimation being<br>\
understood: in the contrary case, one says يَا فَتَى.<br>\
See also, in what follows, a usage of ذَاكَ and ذٰلِكَ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b11-  هٰذَا in a letter and the like is introduced when<br>\
the writer breaks off, turning to a new subject;<br>\
and means “ This is all that I had to say on the<br>\
subject to which, it relates: ” what follows it is<br>\
commenced with the conjunction وَ.] ―<br>\
-b12-  One says,<br>\
لَيْسَ بِذَاكَ [and لَيْسَ بِذٰلِكَ], meaning It is not<br>\
approved: for, [like as a person held in mean<br>\
estimation is indicated by هٰذَا, which denotes a<br>\
thing that is near, so,] on account of its high<br>\
degree of estimation, a thing that is approved is<br>\
indicated by that whereby one indicates a thing<br>\
that is remote. (Kull voce ليس.) [See also what<br>\
next follows.] ―<br>\
-b13-  ذٰلِكَ الكِتَابُ in the Kur ii. 1 is<br>\
said by Zj to mean هٰذَا الكِتَابُ [This book]: but<br>\
others say that ذلك is here used because the book<br>\
is remote [from others] in respect of highness and<br>\
greatness of rank. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b14-  كَذٰلِكَ [lit. Like<br>\
that, often means so, or in like manner: and ―<br>\
-b15- ]<br>\
Let that suffice [thee or] you. (TA in art. ذعر,<br>\
from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b16-  The dim. of ذَا is ذَيَّا: (T, S, M:)<br>\
you form no dim. of the fem. ذِى, using in its<br>\
stead that of تَا, (S,) which is تَيَّا: (T:) the dim.<br>\
of the dual [ذَانِ] is ذَيَّانِ: (S:) and that of [the<br>\
pl.] أُولَآءِ [and أُولَى] is أُولَيَّآءِ [and أُولَيَّا]: (T:) ―<br>\
-b17-<br>\
that of هٰذَا is ذَيَّا, like that of ذَا; [and you may<br>\
say هٰذَيَّا also; for] that of هٰؤُلَآءِ is هٰؤُلَيَّآءِ: (T:) ―<br>\
-b18-<br>\
that of ذَاكَ is ذَيَّاكَ: (S, K: *) and that of تَاكَ is<br>\
تَيَّاكَ: (K in art. تا:) ―<br>\
-b19-  that of ذٰلِكَ is ذَيَّالِكَ:<br>\
(S, K: *) and that of تِلْكَ is تَيَّالِكَ. (S.) A rájiz<br>\
says,<br>\
أَوْ تَحْلِفِى بِرَبِّكَ العَلِىِّ<br>\
إِنِّى أَبُو ذَيَّالِكِ الصَّبِىِّ<br>\
[Or thou shalt swear by thy Lord, the High,<br>\
that I am the father of that little child]: (S,<br>\
TA:) he was an Arab who came from a journey,<br>\
and found that his wife had given birth to a boy<br>\
whom he disacknowledged. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  ذَا is also<br>\
the accus. case of ذُو, q. v.<br>\
