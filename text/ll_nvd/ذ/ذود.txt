ذَادَ, (M, A,) first pers. ذُدْتُ, (T, S,) aor.<br>\
يَذُودُ, (T, A,) inf. n. ذَوْدٌ, (T,) or ذِيَادٌ, (S,) or<br>\
both, (M, A, K,) He drove: (S, M, K:) he<br>\
drove away: (T, S, M, A, K:) and he repelled.<br>\
(M, K.) You say, ذَدْتُ الإِبِلَ I drove the camels:<br>\
(S:) and I drove them away: (T, S:) and [so<br>\
↓ ذَوَّدْتُهَا, for] تَذْوِيدٌ signifies the same as ذِيَادٌ.<br>\
(S.) And ذاد الإِبَلِ عَنِ المَآءِ, (A, Msb,) aor.<br>\
يَذُودُ, inf. n. ذَوْدٌ and ذِيَادٌ, He (the pastor)<br>\
[drove away, or repelled, or] kept back, or debarred, the camels from the water; or prevented<br>\
them from coming to it. (Msb.) And ذادهُ عَنْ<br>\
كَذَا, (A,) and ذُدْتُهُ, (S,) He, and I, drove him<br>\
away from such a thing. (S, A. [And the like is<br>\
said in the M.]) And ذاد عَنِ الحَرَمِ He repelled<br>\
from, or defended, the sacred territory. (L.)<br>\
And الثَّوْرُ يَذُودُ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ بِمِذْوَدِهِ, i. e. (tropical:)  [The bull<br>\
repels from, or defends, himself] with his horn:<br>\
and الفَارِسُ بِمِذْوَدِهِ, i. e. (tropical:)  [the horseman] with<br>\
his spear, or short spear. (A.) And ذاد عَنْ<br>\
عِرْضِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He defended his honour. (L.) And ذاد<br>\
عَنِّى الهَمَّ (tropical:)  [He dispelled from me anxiety.] (A.)<br>\
2<br>\
ذَوَّدَ see above.<br>\

اذادهُ He aided, or assisted, him to drive, or<br>\
drive away, (T, S, M, A,) his camels. (T, S, A.)<br>\
[In the K, أَذَدْتُهُ is said to signify أَعَنْتُهُ عَلَى ذِيَادِ<br>\
أَهْلِهِ: but اهله is app. a mistake for إِبِلِهِ: or عَنْ<br>\
is omitted before اهله; and if so, the meaning is<br>\
I aided, or assisted, him to defend his family;<br>\
but in this latter case, we should read ذِيَادٍ, which<br>\
would be less chaste than الذِّيَادِ.]<br>\
ذَوْدٌ A number of camels, from three to ten:<br>\
(Lth, AZ, As, T, S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K:) this is<br>\
the meaning that is of best repute: (TA:) [in this<br>\
explanation in the T from AZ, and in the K, the<br>\
nouns of number are mase.; and so in the next<br>\
here following: in the rest, fem.:] or from three<br>\
to ten: and a little more: (IAar, M:) or from<br>\
three to nine: (M, L:) or from three to fifteen:<br>\
or from three to twenty; (M, L, K;) and a little<br>\
more: (L:) or from three to thirty: (M, L, K:)<br>\
or from two to nine: (M, Mgh, L, K:) [said to<br>\
be] applied only to females: (Lth, A&#39;Obeyd, T,<br>\
M, Mgh, Msb, K:) so in the Bári&#39;: (Msb:)<br>\
and it is of the fem. gender; (T, S, M, Msb, K;)<br>\
i. e., the word is fem.: (MF:) but its dim. is<br>\
[↓ ذُوَيْدٌ,] without ة; contr. to analogy: (M:)<br>\
the word ذَوْدٌ is a pl., (M, K,) meaning a quasipl. n., (MF,) having no sing. (S, M, K) of the<br>\
same root: (S:) or a sing.; (K;) and its pl. is<br>\
أَذْوَادٌ: (T, S, M, A, Msb, K:) or a sing. and pl.:<br>\
(M, K:) the Arabs said ثَلَاثُ أَذْوَادٍ and ثَلَاثُ ذَوْدٍ<br>\
and so with all the inferior ns. of number, making<br>\
ذَوْد a substitute for أَذْوَاد: and they also said<br>\
ثَلَاثُ ذَوْدٍ meaning thereby three she-camels.<br>\
(M, L.) It is said in a trad., لَيْسَ فِيمَا دُونَ خَمْسِ<br>\
ذَوْدٍ مِنَ الإِبِلِ صَدَقَةٌ, (T, L,) or لَيْسَ فِىأَقَلَّ مِنْ<br>\
خَمْسٍ ذَوْدٍ صَدَقَةٌ, (T, Msb,) meaning [There is not<br>\
in the case of less than five] camels [any poorrate]: for the poor-rate is incumbent on him who<br>\
possesses five camels whether they be males or<br>\
females. (L.) And in another trad. it is said,<br>\
فِى خَمْسِ ذَوْدٍ شَاةٌ [In the case of five camels, a<br>\
sheep or goat shall be given]. (Mgh.) And it is<br>\
said in a prov., الذَّوْدُ إِلَى الذَّوْدِ إِبِلٌ [A few she-camels with a few she-camels are a herd of<br>\
camels]; (T, S, M, A;) meaning that a little with<br>\
a little is much; الى being here used in the sense<br>\
of مَعَ: (S, A:) or الى is here used in its proper<br>\
sense; a word signifying “ joined ” or the like<br>\
being understood; (TA;) i. e. a few joined to a<br>\
few becomes much: (M:) [or,] accord. to the K<br>\
[and the T], this prov. shows that ذود is here<br>\
used in the place of اِثْنَتَانِ [i. e. two she-camels];<br>\
for two added to two are a pl.; but this requires<br>\
consideration. (MF.)<br>\
ذُوَيْدٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
ذَوَّادٌ: see the next following paragraph.<br>\
ذَائِدٌ Driving: driving away: and repelling:<br>\
pl. ذُوَّدٌ and ذُوَّادٌ and ذَادَةٌ. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, and<br>\
↓ ذَوَّادٌ, [but the latter has an intensive meaning,]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A man who is a defender, or protector, of that<br>\
which, or those whom, it is necessary to defend,<br>\
or protect: (S, K:) who is wont to repel attacks<br>\
upon his honour. (S, * TA.)<br>\
مَذَادٌ A place where beasts pasture at pleasure,<br>\
where they eat and drink what they please, amid<br>\
abundance of herbage. (IAar, K.)<br>\
مِذْوَدٌ [An instrument for driving, driving<br>\
away, or repelling. ―<br>\
-b2- ] (tropical:)  A spear, or short spear,<br>\
with which one repels from, or defends, himself.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  The horn of a bull, (T, A, K,) with<br>\
which he repels from, or defends, himself. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  (tropical:)  The tongue: (S, M, A, K:) because with it<br>\
a man defends his honour. (M.) Hassán Ibn-Thábit says,<br>\
لِسَانِى وَسَيْفِى صَارِمَانِ كِلَاهُمَا<br>\
وَيَبْلُغُ مَا لَا يَبْلُغُ السَّيْفُ مِذْوَدِى<br>\
(tropical:)  [My tongue and my sword are sharp, both of<br>\
them; and my tongue reacheth what my sword<br>\
will not reach]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (tropical:)  [A man who<br>\
defends well, or vigorously; as also ↓ مِذْوَادٌ:]<br>\
you say رِجَالٌ مَذَاوِدٌ and مَذَاوِيدُ. (A.) ―<br>\
-b6-  The<br>\
manger (مِعْلَف, T, K, TA, in some copies of the<br>\
K معتلف, TA) of a horse or similar beast.<br>\

day.])<br>\
