[or يُؤْدِبُ], (AZ, S,) inf. n. إِيدَابٌ [originally<br>\
إِئْدَابٌ]. (AZ, S, K.) You say, أَدَبَ القَوْمَ, (S,)<br>\
or أَدَبَ عَلَى القَوْمِ, aor. as above, (T,) He invited<br>\
the people to his repast. (T, S.) And أَدَبَهُمْ عَلَى<br>\
الأَمرِ He collected them together for the affair.<br>\
(A.) And جِيرَانَكَ لِتُشَاوِرَهُمْ ↓ أُودِبُ [I will collect<br>\
thy neighbours in order that thou mayest consult<br>\
with them]. (A.) The primary signification of<br>\
أَدْبٌ is The act of inviting. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
أَدَبٌ, aor.<br>\
اَدِبَ; (Msb, K;) or أَدِبَ, aor.<br>\
اَدَبَ; (so in a<br>\
copy of the M;) inf. n. أَدْبٌ, (M, Mgh, Msb,) or<br>\
أَدَبٌ; (K;) He made a repast, or banquet, (M,<br>\
Msb, K,) and invited people to it; (Msb;) as<br>\
also ↓ آدَبَ, (M,) aor. and inf. n. as above:<br>\
(TA:) or he collected and invited people to his<br>\
repast. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also, as will be seen<br>\
below, voce أَدَبٌ] أَدَبَهُ, aor.<br>\
اَدِبَ, inf. n. أَدْبٌ, He<br>\
taught him the discipline of the mind, and the<br>\
acquisition of good qualities and attributes of<br>\
the mind or soul; (Msb;) and ↓ أدّبهُ, [inf. n.<br>\
تَأْدِيبٌ, signifies the same;] he taught him what<br>\
is termed أَدَب [or good discipline of the mind<br>\
and manners, &amp;c.; i. e. he disciplined him, or<br>\
educated him, well; rendered him well-bred, wellmannered, polite; instructed him in polite accomplishments; &amp;c.]: (S, M, A, Mgh, K:) or<br>\
the latter verb, inf. n. تَأْدِيبُ, signifies he taught<br>\
him well, or much, the discipline of the mind,<br>\
and the acquisition of good qualities and attributes<br>\
of the mind or soul: and hence, this latter also<br>\
signifies he disciplined him, chastised him, corrected him, or punished him, for his evil conduct;<br>\
because discipline, or chastisement, is a means<br>\
of inviting a person to what is properly termed<br>\
الأَدَبُ. (Msb.)<br>\

evil, (T, Mgh,) signifies Discipline of the mind;<br>\
and good qualities and attributes of the mind or<br>\
soul: (Msb:) or every praiseworthy discipline<br>\
by which a man is trained in any excellence: (AZ,<br>\
Mgh, Msb:) [good discipline of the mind and<br>\
manners; good education; good breeding; good<br>\
manners; politeness; polite accomplishments:]<br>\
i. q. ظَرْفٌ [as meaning excellence, or elegance, of<br>\
mind, manners, address, and speech]: and a good<br>\

honourable actions: (El-Jawáleekee:) or the<br>\
practice of what is praiseworthy both in words<br>\

things which are approved, or deemed good: or<br>\
the honouring of those who are above one, and<br>\
being gentle, courteous, or civil, to those who are<br>\
below one: (Towsheeh:) or a faculty which preserves him in whom it exists from what would<br>\
disgrace him: (MF:) it is of two kinds, أَدَبُ<br>\
النَّفْسِ [which embraces all the significations explained above], and أَدَبُ الدَّرْسِ [which signifies<br>\
the discipline to be observed in the prosecution of<br>\
study, by the disciple with respect to the preceptor,<br>\
and by the preceptor with respect to the disciple:<br>\
see ‘Haji Khalfæ Lexicon,’ Vol. I. p. 212]:<br>\
(S, Btl, Mgh:) [also deportment, or a mode of<br>\
conduct or behaviour, absolutely; for one speaks<br>\
of good أَدَب and bad أَدَب:] the pl. is آدَابٌ<br>\
[which is often employed, and so is the sing. also,<br>\
as signifying the rules of discipline to be observed<br>\
in the exercise of a function, such as that of a<br>\
judge, and of a governor; and in the exercise of<br>\
an art, such as that of the disputer, and the orator,<br>\
and the poet, and the scribe; &amp;c.]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
عِلْمُ الأَدَبِ signifies [The science of philology; or]<br>\
the science by which one guards against error in<br>\
the language of the Arabs, with respect to words<br>\
and with respect to writing; (‘Haji Khalfæ<br>\
Lexicon,’ Vol. I. p. 215;) [and so, simply,<br>\
الأَدَبُ: which is also used to signify polite literature: but in this sense, and like wise] as applied to<br>\
the sciences relating to the Arabic language, [or<br>\
the philological sciences, which are also termed<br>\

أَدِيبٌ Characterized by what is termed أَدَب<br>\
[or good discipline of the mind and manners, &amp;c.;<br>\
i. e. well-disciplined, well-educated, well-bred, or<br>\
well-mannered; polite; instructed in polite accomplishments, or an elegant scholar; &amp;c.]: (T,<br>\
S, M, Mgh, K:) pl. أُدَبَآءٍ. (M, K.) ―<br>\

مَؤَدَّبٌ.<br>\
آدَبُ [originally أَأْدَبُ, More, or most, characterized by what is termed أَدَب; i. e. better, or<br>\
best, disciplined, educated, bred, or mannered;<br>\

مَأْدَبَةٌ: see what next follows, in two places.<br>\
مَأْدُبَةٌ A repast, or banquet, to which guests are<br>\
invited; (A &#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) or<br>\
made on account of a wedding: (M, K:) as also<br>\
↓ مَأْدُبَةٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) or, accord. to A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\

is called مَأْدُبَةُ اللّٰهِ فِى الأَرْضِ, or ↓ مَأْدَبَة; and<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd says that, if we read مأدُبة, the meaning<br>\
is, God&#39;s repast which He has made in the earth,<br>\
and to which He has invited mankind; but if we<br>\
read مأدَبة, this word is of the measure مَفْعَلَةٌ from<br>\
الأَدَبُ, [and the meaning is, a means which God<br>\
has prepared in the earth for men&#39;s learning good<br>\
discipline of the mind, &amp;c.; it being a noun<br>\
similar to مَثْرَاةٌ and مَكْثَرَةٌ &amp;c.:] El-Ahmar, however, makes both words synonymous. (T, M, *<br>\
TA.)<br>\
