أخَذَ, (S, A, L, &amp;c.,) in the first pers. of<br>\
which, أَخَذْتُ, [and the like,] the ذ is generally<br>\
changed into ت, and incorporated into the [augmentative] ت, [but in pronunciation only, for<br>\
one writes أَخَذتُّ and the like,] aor.<br>\
اَخُذَ, imperative<br>\
خُذْ, originally اؤْخُذْ, (S, L,) which latter form<br>\
sometimes occurs, [but with و in the place of ؤْ<br>\
when the ا is pronounced with damm,] (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. أَخْذٌ (S, L, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and تَأْخَاذٌ, (S,<br>\
L, K,) the latter having an intensive signification;<br>\

خُذْ بِالخِطَامَ Take thou, or take thou with thy<br>\
hand, or take thou hold of, the nose-rein of the<br>\
camel: (S, L, Msb:) the ب in the latter phrase<br>\
being redundant. (Msb.) [And أَخَذَ بِيَدِهِ, lit.<br>\

thou what I say, and dismiss from thee doubt<br>\

got, or acquired, it; syn. حَازَ; (Z, Er-Rághib, B;)<br>\

لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةِ وَ لَا نَوْمٌ (assumed tropical:)  Neither drowsiness nor<br>\
sleep shall seize [or overcome] Him. (B.) [And<br>\
you say, أَخَذَتْهُ رِعْدَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A tremour seized, took,<br>\

أَخَذَ بِالحَلْقِ [It (food, &amp;c.) choked]. (IAar in<br>\

-b10-  See also 2, in three places. ―<br>\
-b11-  He<br>\
gained the mastery over a person, and killed, or<br>\
slew, him; (Zj, L;) as also ↓ آخَذَ: (L:) or simply,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  he killed, or slew. (B.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[xl. 5], وَهَمَّتْ كُّلُ أُمَّةٍ بِرَسُولِهِمْ لِيَأْخُذُوهُ, meaning<br>\
[And every nation hath purposed against their<br>\

them for their sins. (Jel.) ―<br>\
-b13-  (tropical:)  He punished, or<br>\
chastised; (L, Msb, B, K, MF;) as also ↓ آخَذَ:<br>\
(L, Msb, MF:) as in the phrases, أَخَذَهُ بِذَنْبِهِ<br>\
(Msb, K *) and بِهِ ↓ آخَذَهُ, inf. n. of the latter<br>\
مُؤَاخَذَةٌ, (S, L, Msb, K,) (tropical:)  he punished, or chastised, him for his sin, or offence: (Msb:) and<br>\
أُخِذَ بِذَنْبِهِ means (assumed tropical:)  he was restrained and requited and punished for his sin, or offence: (L:)<br>\
or, accord. to some, أَخَذَ signifies he extirpated,<br>\
or exterminated; and ↓ آخذ he punished, or chastised, without extirpating, or exterminating.<br>\
(MF.) [For ↓ آخذ,] some say وَاخَذَ, (S, L,)<br>\
which is not allowable, (K,) accord. to some; but<br>\
accord. to others, it is a chaste form; (MF;) of<br>\
the dial. of El-Yemen, and used by certain of the<br>\
seven readers [of the Kur-án] in the instance of<br>\
لَا يُوَاخِذُكُمُ اللّٰهُ [ii. 225 and v. 91]; and the<br>\

is وَاخِذْ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b14-  (tropical:)  He made a violent assault<br>\
upon a person, and wounded him much. (K, TA.)<br>\
[You say also, أَخَذَهُ بِلِسَانِهِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He assailed him with his tongue; vituperated him;<br>\
spoke against him.] ―<br>\

former the more common, the latter occurring<br>\
in art. حوط in the K,) (assumed tropical:)  He took the course prescribed by prudence, discretion, precaution, or<br>\
good judgment; he used precaution: and, like<br>\

And أَخَذَ حِذْرَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He took care; became cautious,<br>\
or vigilant. (Bd in iv. 73 and 103.) [And أَخَذَ<br>\
بِمَا قَالَ فُلَانٌ (assumed tropical:)  He took to, or adopted and followed, or adhered to, what such a one said: see Har<br>\
p. 367; where it is said that اخذ when thus used<br>\
is made trans. by means of ب because it implies<br>\
the meaning of تَشَبَّثَ.] ―<br>\
-b16-  He took to, set about,<br>\
began, or commenced; as in the saying, أَخَذَ يَفْعَلُ<br>\
كَذَا He took to, set about, began, or commenced,<br>\
doing such a thing; in which case, accord. to Sb,<br>\
اخذ is one of those verbs which do not admit of<br>\
one&#39;s putting the act. part. n. in the place of the<br>\
verb which is its enunciative: [i. e., one may not<br>\
say فَاعِلًا in the place of يفعل in the phrase above:]<br>\
and as in أَخَذَ فِى كَذَا He began, commenced, or<br>\
entered upon, such a thing. (L.) ―<br>\
-b17-  [It is used<br>\
in a variety of other phrases, in which the primary<br>\
meaning is more or less apparent; and several of<br>\
these will be found explained with other words<br>\
occurring therein. The following instances may<br>\
be here added.] ―<br>\
-b18-  طَرِيقٌ يَأْخُذُ فِى رَمْلَةٍ [A road<br>\

respect by reason of his greatness therein]. (TA<br>\

milk. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He (a camel, L, K, or a sheep or<br>\

أَخَّذَتْهُ, (S, L, K, *) inf. n. تَأْخِيذٌ, (S, L,)<br>\
She captivated, or fascinated, him, (namely, her<br>\
husband,) and restrained him, by a kind of enchantment, or charm, and especially so as to withhold him from carnal conversation with other<br>\
women; (S, * L, K, * TA;) as also ↓ أَخَذَتْهُ; and<br>\
↓ آخَذَتْهُ [of which the inf. n. is app. إِيخَاذٌ]. (L,<br>\
TA.) A woman says, أُؤَخِّذُ جَمَلِى I captivate,<br>\
or fascinate, my husband, by a kind of enchantment, or charm, and withhold him from other<br>\
women. (L, from a trad.) And one says, of a<br>\
man, يُؤَخِّذُ عَنِ امْرَأَتِهِ He withholds others [by a<br>\
kind of enchantment, or charm,] from carnal<br>\
conversation with his wife. (Msb.) The sister of<br>\
Subh El-&#39;Ádee said, in bewailing him, when he<br>\
had been killed by a man pushed towards him<br>\
upon a couch-frame, or raised couch, ↓ أَخَذتُّ<br>\
عَنْكَ الرَّاكِبَ وَالسَّاعِىَ وَالمَاشِىَ والقَاعِدَ وَالقَائِمَ وَلَمْ<br>\
آخُذْ عَنْكَ النَّائِمَ [I withheld from thee by enchantment the rider and the runner and the walker and<br>\
the sitter and the stander, and did not so withhold<br>\
from thee the prostrate]. (L.) And one says of<br>\
a beautiful garment, القُلُوبَ مَأْخَذَهُ ↓ أَخَذَ [It<br>\
captivated hearts in a manner peculiar to it]:<br>\
(K in art. حصر: [in the CK, incorrectly, اَخَذَت<br>\
and القُلُوبُ:]) and اخذ بِقَلْبِهِ [He, or it, captivated his heart; or] he [or it] pleased him, or<br>\

4<br>\
آخذ, inf. n., app., إِيخَاذٌ: see 2.<br>\
8<br>\
ائتخذ [written with the disjunctive alif<br>\
اِيتَخَذَ] occurs in its original form; and is changed<br>\
into اتَّخَذَ [with the disjunctive alif اِتَّخَذَ]; this<br>\
being of the measure افتعل from أَخْذُ, the [radical]<br>\
ء being softened, and changed into ت, and incorporated [into the augmentative ت]: hence, when<br>\
it had come to be much used in the form of افتعل<br>\
[thus changed], they imagined the [former] ت to<br>\
be a radical letter [unchanged], and formed from<br>\
it a verb of the measure فَعِلَ, aor. يَفْعَلُ; saying,<br>\
تَخِذَ, aor. يَتْخَذُ, (S, L, Msb, *) inf. n. تَخَذٌ and<br>\
تَخْذٌ: (Msb:) and ↓ اسْتَخَذَ [written with the disjunctive alif اِسْتَخَذَ], of which exs. will be found<br>\
below, is also used for اتّخذ; one of the two ت s<br>\
being changed into س, like as س is changed into<br>\
ت in سِتٌّ [for سِدْسٌ]: or استخذ may be of the<br>\
measure استفعل from تَخِذَ; one of the two ت s<br>\
being suppressed; after the manner of those who<br>\
say ظَلْتُ for ظَلِلْتُ: (S, L:) and IAth says<br>\
that اتّخذ, in like manner, is of the measure افتعل<br>\
from تَخِذَ; not from أَخَذَ: (L and K in art.<br>\
تخذ:) but IAth is not one who should contradict<br>\
J, whose opinion on this point is corroborated<br>\
by the fact that they say اتَّزَرَ from إِزَارٌ, and اتَّمَنَ<br>\
from أَمْنٌ, and اتَّهَلَ from أَهْلٌ; and there are<br>\
other instances of the same kind: or, accord. to<br>\
some, اتّخذ is from وَخَذَ, a dial. var. of أَخَذَ,<br>\
and is originally اِوْتَخَذَ. (MF.) [The various<br>\
significations of اتّخذ and تَخِذَ and استخذ will<br>\
be here given under one head.] ―<br>\
-b2-  You say,<br>\
إِئْتَخَذُوا فِى القِتَالِ, (S, L, K, *) and فى الحَرْبِ,<br>\
(Msb,) with two hemzehs, (S, L, K,) or, correctly,<br>\
إِيتَخَذُوا, with one hemzeh, [or اِيتَخَذُوا,] as two<br>\
hemzehs cannot occur together in one word,<br>\
(marginal note in a copy of the S,) [but in a<br>\
case of wasl, the first hemzeh being suppressed,<br>\
the second remains unchanged,] They took, or<br>\
seized, (أَخَذُوا,) one another (S, L, Msb, K) in<br>\
fight, (S, L,) and in war; (Msb;) and so<br>\
اِتَّخَذُوا. (Msb.) And اِيتَخَذَ القَوْمُ The people,<br>\
of company of men, wrestled together, each taking<br>\
hold in some manner upon him who wrestled with<br>\
him, to throw him down. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [اتّخذ,<br>\
as also ↓ استخذ, and] تَخِذَ, aor.<br>\
اَخَذَ, (K in art.<br>\
تخذ,) inf. n. تَخَذَ and تَخْذٌ, (TA in art. تخذ,)<br>\
likewise signifies i. q. أَخَذَ, (K in art. تخذ, and<br>\
B and TA in the present art.,) as meaning He<br>\
took a thing to, or for, himself; took possession<br>\
of it; got, or acquired, it; syn. حَازَ and حَصَّلَ.<br>\
(B, TA.) Some read, [in the Kur, xviii. 76,]<br>\
لَتَخِذْتَ عَلَيْهِ أَجْراً [Thou mightest assuredly have<br>\
taken for thyself a recompense for it]: (S, L, K<br>\
in art. تخذ, and TA in the present art.:) this<br>\
is the reading of Mujáhid, (Fr, TA,) and is<br>\
authorized by I&#39;Ab, and is that of Aboo-&#39;Amr<br>\
Ibn-El-&#39;Alà and AZ, and so it is written in the<br>\
model-copy of the Kur, and so the readers [in<br>\
general] read: (AM, L, TA:) so read Ibn-Ketheer<br>\
and the Basrees; he and Yaakoob and Hafs<br>\
pronouncing the ذ; the others incorporating it<br>\
[into the ت]: (Bd:) some read لااتَّخَذتَّ; (L<br>\
and K in art. تخذ;) but these read at variance<br>\
with the scripture. (AM, L, TA.) أَرْضاً ↓ استخذ<br>\
is a phrase mentioned by Mbr as used by some<br>\
of the Arabs, (S, L,) and signifies i. q. اِتَّخَذَهَا<br>\
[He took for himself a piece of land]. (S, L, K.)<br>\
And اتّخذ وَلَدَّا [in the Kur, ii. 110, &amp;c.,] signifies<br>\
He got a son, or offspring. (Bd &amp;c. See also<br>\
below.) And تَخِذَ, aor.<br>\
اَخَذَ, inf. n. تَخَذٌ and تَخْذٌ,<br>\
also signifies He gained, acquired, or earned,<br>\
wealth, (L, and Msb in arts. اخذ and تخذ,) or<br>\
a thing. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عَلَيْهِمْ يَدًا ↓ استخذ and عِنْدَهُمْ<br>\
signify alike, i. q. اتّخذ [He did to them a<br>\
benefit, or favour; as though he earned one<br>\
for himself in prospect, making it to be incumbent on them as a debt to him]: (ISh:) and<br>\
اِتَّخَذْتُ عِنْدَهُ مَعْروفًا means [in like manner,<br>\
as also عنده معروفا ↓ أَخَذْتُ, and يَدَّا, (and اِتَّخَذَ<br>\
فِيهِ حُسْناً has a similar meaning; see Kur xviii.<br>\
85;)] I did to him a benefit, or favour; syn.<br>\
أَسْدَيْتُهُ إِلَيْهِ. (Msb in art. سدي.) ―<br>\
-b5-  اتّخذ also<br>\
signifies He made a thing; syn. عَمِلَ; like تَخِذَ,<br>\
[aor.<br>\
اَخَذَ,] inf. n. تَخَذٌ and تَخْذٌ: (L:) he made, or<br>\
manufactured, a bow, a water-skin, &amp;c., مِنْ كَذَا<br>\
of such a thing: he made, or prepared, a dish<br>\
of food, a medicine, &amp;c.: either absolutely or<br>\
for himself. (The Lexicons passim.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also<br>\
He made, or constituted, or appointed; syn.<br>\
جَعَلَ; doubly trans.; (B, Msb;) and so تَخِذَ.<br>\
(Msb in art. تخذ.) You say, اتّخذهُ صَدِيقًا He<br>\
made him [or took him as] a friend; (Msb in<br>\
the present art.;) and so تَخِذَهُ. (Idem in art.<br>\
تخذ.) And اتّخذهُ هُزُؤًا [in the Kur ii. 63 and<br>\
231, &amp;c.,] means He made him, or it, a subject<br>\
of derision. (Bd, Jel.) And اتّخذهُ وَلَدًا [in<br>\
the same, xii. 21 and xxviii. 8,] He made him,<br>\
or took or adopted him as, a son. (Bd. See<br>\
also above.)<br>\
10<br>\
اسْتَخَذَ, written with the disjunctive alif<br>\
اِسْتَخَذَ: see 8, in four places. [Other meanings<br>\
may be inferred from explanations of مُسْتَأْخِذٌ,<br>\
q. v. infrà.]<br>\
أَخْذٌ inf. n. of أَخَذَ, q. v. ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A way, or manner, of life; as also ↓ إِخْذٌ. (S, L, K.) You say,<br>\
ذَهَبَ بَنُو فُلَانٍ وَمَنْ أَخَذَ أَخْذَهُمْ, (S, L, K, *) and<br>\
↓ إِخْذَهُمْ, (L, K,) the former of the dial. of<br>\
Temeem, and the latter of the dial. of El-Hijáz,<br>\
(TA,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  The sons of such a one went<br>\
away, or passed away, and those who took to their<br>\
way of life, (S, L, K,) and adopted their manners,<br>\
or dispositions: (K:) and مَنْ أَخَذَ أَخْذُهُمْ and<br>\
↓ إِخْذُهُمْ, and مَنْ أَخَذَ أَخْذُهُمْ [in the CK<br>\
اَخْذُهُمْ] and ↓ إِخْذُهُمْ, signify [virtually] the<br>\
same: (K:) or مَنْ أَخَذَهُ أَخْذُهُمْ and ↓ إِخْذُهُمْ<br>\
signify [properly] مَنْ أَخَذَهُ أَخْذُهُمْ وَسِيرَتُهُمْ [those<br>\
