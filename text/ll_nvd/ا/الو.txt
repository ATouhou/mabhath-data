أَلَا, (S, M, Mgh, K,) aor. يَأْلُو, (S, Mgh,)<br>\
inf. n. أَلْوٌ (T, M, Mgh, K) and أُلُوُّ (K, TA [in<br>\
a copy of the M أَلُوٌّ]) and أُلِىٌّ; (K, TA; [in<br>\
a copy of the M أَلِىٌّ, and in a copy of the Mgh<br>\
written with fet-h and damm to the أ;]) and<br>\
↓ أَلَّى, (S, M, K,) aor. يُؤَلّى, inf. n. تَأْلِيَةٌ; (S;)<br>\
and ↓ ائتلى [written with the disjunctive alif<br>\
اِيتَلَى]; (S, M, K;) [and ↓ تَأَلّى, as appears from<br>\
an ex. in a verse cited in art. نشب, q. v.;] He<br>\
fell short; or he fell short of doing what was<br>\
requisite, or what he ought to have done; or he<br>\
flagged, or was remiss; syn. قَصَّرَ: (S, M, K;<br>\
and Fr, IAar, T, Mgh, in explanation of the first<br>\
of these verbs:) and he was slow, or tardy:<br>\
(M, K; and AA, T, S, in explanation of the<br>\
second verb:) or he flagged, or was remiss, or<br>\
languid, and weak. (A Heyth and T in explanation of all of the above-mentioned verbs except the<br>\
last.) You say, أَلَا فِى الأَمْرِ, (Mgh,) and ↓ ائتلى<br>\
فِيهِ, (S,) He fell short, &amp;c., (قَصَّرَ,) in the affair.<br>\
(S, Mgh.) In the saying, لَم يَأْلُ أَنْ يَعْدِلَ فِى ذلِكَ,<br>\
i. e. He did not fall short, &amp;c., (لَمْ يُقَصَّرْ,) in<br>\
acting equitably and equally in that, فِى is<br>\
suppressed before ان: but in the phrase, لَمْ يَأْلُو<br>\
مِنَ العَدْلِ, as some relate it, [the meaning intended<br>\
seems to be, They did not hold back, or the like,<br>\
from acting equitably; for here] the verb is<br>\
made to imply the meaning of another verb: and<br>\
such is the case in the saying, لَا آلُوكَ نُصْحًا,<br>\
meaning I will not refuse to thee, nor partially<br>\
or wholly deprive thee of, sincere, honest, or<br>\
faithful, advice: (Mgh:) or this last signifies<br>\
I will not flag, or be remiss, nor fall short,<br>\
to thee in giving sincere, honest, or faithful,<br>\
advice. (T, S. *) It is said in the Kur [iii. 114],<br>\
لَا يَإْلُونَكُمْ خَبَالًا, meaning They will not fall short,<br>\
or flag, or be remiss, in corrupting you. (IAar,<br>\
T.) And the same meaning is assigned to the<br>\
verb in the saying أُولُو الْفَضْلِ مِنْكُمْ, ↓ وَلَا يَأْتَلِ, in<br>\
the Kur [xxiv. 22], by A&#39;Obeyd: but the preferable rendering in this case is that of A Heyth,<br>\
which will be found below: see 4. (T.) Ks<br>\
mentions the phrase, أَقْبَلَ بِضَرْبَةٍ لَا يَأْلُ [He came<br>\
with a blow, not falling short, &amp;c.], for لا يَأْلُو;<br>\
like لَا أَدْرِ [for لا أَدْرِى]. (S, M: [but in the<br>\
copies of the former in my hands, for بِضَرْبَةٍ, I<br>\
find يَضْرِبُهُ.]) ↓ أَلَّى [with teshdeed] is also said<br>\
of a dog, and of a hawk, meaning He fell short<br>\
of attaining the game that he pursued. (TA.)<br>\
And of a cake of bread, meaning It was slow<br>\
in becoming thoroughly baked. (IAar, IB.) [See<br>\
also the phrase لَا دَريْتَ وَلَا ائْتَليْتَ in a later<br>\
part of this paragraph.] ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also, مَا أَلَوْتُ<br>\
الشَّيْءَ, (K,) or مَا أَلَوْتُ أَنْ أَفْعَلَهُ, (M,) inf. n أَلوٌ<br>\
(M, K) and أُلُوٌّ, (K, TA, [in a copy of the M<br>\
أُلْوٌ,]) meaning I did not leave, quit, cease from,<br>\
omit, or neglect, (M, K,) the thing, (K,) or doing<br>\
it. (M.) And فُلَانٌ لَا يَأْلُو خَيْرًا Such a one does<br>\
not leave, quit, or cease from, doing good. (M.)<br>\
And مَا أَلَوْتُ جَهْدًا I did not leave, omit, or<br>\
neglect, labour, exertion, effort, or endeavour:<br>\
and the vulgar say, مَا آلُوكَ جَهْدًا; but this is<br>\
wrong: so says As. (T. [See, however, similar<br>\
phrases mentioned above.])<br>\
-A2-  أَلَا, aor. as above,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. أَلْوٌ, (IAar, T, TA,) also signifies<br>\
He strove, or laboured; he exerted himself, or<br>\
his power or ability; (IAar, T, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ تَأَلَّى: (T, TA:) the contr. of a signification<br>\
before mentioned; i. e. “he flagged;,” or “was<br>\
remiss, or languid, and weak.” (TA.) You<br>\
say, أَتَانِى فِى حَاجَةٍ فَأَلَوْتُ فِيهَا He came to me<br>\
respecting a want, and I strove, or laboured, &amp;c.,<br>\
to accomplish it. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And أَلَاهُ, aor. as above,<br>\
(T, S,) inf. n. أَلْوٌ, (IAar, T, S,) He was, or<br>\
became, able to do it: (IAar, T, S:) and ↓ ألّى,<br>\
inf. n. تَأْلِيَةٌ, also signifies he was, or became,<br>\
able; (TA;) and so ↓ ائتلى. (ISk, S, TA.)<br>\
You say, هُوَ يَأْلُو هذَا الأَمْرَ He is able to perform,<br>\
or accomplish, this affair. (T.) And مَا أَلَوْتُهُ I<br>\
was not able to do it. (T, M, K.) And أَتَانِى<br>\
فُلَانٌ فِى حَاجَةٍ فَمَا أَلَوْتُ رَدَّهُ Such a one came<br>\
to me respecting a want, and I was not able to<br>\
rebuff him. (T.) It is said in a trad., مَنْ صَامَ<br>\
↓ الدَّهْرَ فَلَا صَامَ وَلَا أَلَّى [He who fasts ever, or<br>\
always, may he neither fast] nor be able to fast:<br>\
as though it were an imprecation: or it may<br>\
be enunciative: another reading is وَلَا آلَ, explained as meaning وَلَا رَجَعَ: [See art. اول:]<br>\
but El-Khattábee says that it is correctly أَلَّى<br>\
and أَلَا. (TA.) And the Arabs used to say,<br>\
(S, M,) [and] accord. to a trad. it will be said to<br>\
the hypocrite [in his grave], on his being asked<br>\
respecting Mohammad and what he brought,<br>\
and answering “I know not,” (T in art. تلو,)<br>\
↓ لَا دَرَيْتَ وَلَا ائتَلَيْتَ, (T, S, M, K,) meaning,<br>\
accord. to As, (T,) or ISk, (S,) Mayest thou<br>\
not know, nor be able to know: (T, S: *) or,<br>\
accord. to Fr, nor fall short, or flag, in seeking<br>\
to know; that the case may be the more miserable<br>\
to thee: (T:) or وَلَا أَلَيْتَ, as an imitative sequent<br>\
[for ولا أَلَوْتَ, to which the same explanations<br>\
are applicable]: (MK:) or لَا دَرَيْتَ وَلَا تَلَيْتَ,<br>\
the latter verb being assimilated to the former,<br>\
(ISk, T in art. تلو, S,) said to mean وَلَا تَلَوْتَ,<br>\
i. e. nor mayest thou read nor study: (T in art.<br>\
تلو:) or لَا دَرَيْتَ وَلَا أَتْليْتَ, i. e. [mayest thou<br>\
not know,] nor mayest thou have camels followed<br>\
by young ones. (Yoo, ISk, T, S, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
(IAar, T,) inf. n. أَلْوٌ, (IAar, T, K,) He gave him<br>\
a thing: (IAar, T, K: *) [doubly trans.:] the<br>\
contr. of a signification before mentioned, (also<br>\
given by IAar, T and TA,) which is that of<br>\
“refusing” [a person anything: see, above,<br>\
لَا آلُوكَ نُصْحًا]. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
اَلَّوَ see 1, in four places.<br>\
4<br>\
آلى, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) aor. يُؤْلِى, inf. n. إِيلَآءٌ,<br>\
(T, S, Mgh,) [and in poetry إِلَآءٌ, (see a reading<br>\
of a verse cited voce أَلِيّةٌ,)] He swore; (T, S, M,<br>\
Mgh, K;) as also ↓ تألّى, and ↓ ائتلى. (T, S, M,<br>\
K.) You say, آلَيْتُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ and آلَيْتُهُ [I swore<br>\
to do the thing]. (M.) [And آلَيْتُ لَا أَفْعَلُ كَذَا<br>\
I swore that I would not do such a thing; and,<br>\
emphatically, I swear that I will not do such<br>\
a thing. And آلَى يَمِينًا He swore an oath.] It<br>\
is said in the Kur [xxiv. 22], أُولُو ↓ وَلَا يَأْتَلِ<br>\
الْفَضْلِ مِنْكُمْ, meaning, accord. to A Heyth and<br>\
Fr, And let not those of you who possess superabundance swear [that they will not give to<br>\
relations &amp;c.]; for Aboo-Bekr [is particularly<br>\
alluded to thereby, because he] had sworn that he<br>\
would not expend upon Mistah and his relations<br>\
who had made mention of [the scandal respecting]<br>\
&#39;Áïsheh: and some of the people of El-Medeeneh<br>\
read ↓ وَلَا يَتَأَلَّ, but this disagrees with the written<br>\
text: A&#39;Obeyd explains it differently: see 1:<br>\
but the preferable meaning is that here given.<br>\
(T.) And it is said in a trad., آلَي مِنْ نِسَائِهِ شَهْرًا<br>\
He swore that he would not go in to his wives<br>\
for a month: the verb being here made trans.<br>\
by means of من because it implies the meaning<br>\
of اِمْتِنَاع, which is thus trans. (TA.) [See also<br>\
an ex. of the verb thus used in the Kur ii. 226.]<br>\
عَلَى اللّٰهِ ↓ التَّأَلِّى is said to mean One&#39;s saying,<br>\
By God, such a one will assuredly enter the fire<br>\
[of Hell], and God will assuredly make to have<br>\
a good issue the work of such a one: but see<br>\
the act. part. n. below. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  آلَتْ, inf. n.<br>\
as above, She (a woman) took for herself, or<br>\
made, or prepared, a مِئْلَاة, q. v. (TA.)<br>\

تَاَلَّوَ see 1, in two places:<br>\

places.<br>\

-A2-  and see 4, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
أَلْوٌ, or إِلْوٌ: see إِلًى in art. الى.<br>\
أُلُو, (so in some copies of the S, and so in<br>\
the K in the last division of that work, and in<br>\
the CK in art. ال, [and thus it is always pronounced,] but in some copies of the K in art. ال<br>\
it is written أُلُونَ, [as though to show the original<br>\
form of its termination,]) or أُولُو, (so in the M,<br>\
and in some copies of the S, [and thus it is<br>\
generally written,]) i. q. ذَوُو [Possessors of;<br>\
possessed of; possessing; having]; a pl. which<br>\
has no sing. (S, M, K) of its own proper letters,<br>\
(S, K,) its sing. being ذُو: (S:) or, as some<br>\
say, a quasi-pl. n., of which the sing. is ذُو: (K:)<br>\
the fem. is أُلَاتُ, (so in some copies of the S and<br>\
K, [and thus it is always pronounced,]) or<br>\
أُولَاتُ, (so in other copies of the S and K, [and<br>\
thus it is generally written,]) of which the sing.<br>\
is ذَاتُ: (S, K:) it is as though its sing. were<br>\
أُلٌ, (M, K, [in the CK الٌ,]) the [final] و [in<br>\
the masc.] being the sign of the pl., (M,) for<br>\
it has و [for its termination] in the nom. case,<br>\
and ى in the accus. and gen. (M, K.) It is<br>\
never used but as a prefixed noun. (M, K.)<br>\
The following are exs. of the nom. case: نَحْنُ أُولُو<br>\
قُوَّةٍ وَأُولُو بَأْسٍ شَدِيدٍ [We are possessors of strength,<br>\
and possessors of vehement courage], in the Kur<br>\
[xxvii. 23]; and أُولُو الْأَرْحَامِ بَعْضُهُمْ أَوْلَى بِبَعْضٍ<br>\
[The possessors of relationships, these have the<br>\
best title to inheritance, one with respect to<br>\
another], in the same [viii. last verse and xxxiii.<br>\
6]; (TA;) and جَآءَ نِى أُولُو الأَلْبَابِ [The persons<br>\
of understandings came to me]; and أُولَاتُ الأَحْمَالِ<br>\
[Those who are with child; occurring in the<br>\
Kur lxv. 4]: (S:) and the following are exs.<br>\
of the accus. and gen. cases: وَذَرْنِى وَالْمُكَذَّبِينَ<br>\
أُولِى النَّعْمَةِ [And leave thou me, or let me alone,<br>\
with the beliers, or discrediters, (i. e., commit<br>\
their case to me,) the possessors of ease and plenty],<br>\
in the Kur [lxxiii. 11]; and لَتَنُوءُ بِالْعُصْبَةِ أُولِى<br>\
القُوَّةِ [Would weigh down the company of men<br>\
possessing strength], in the same [xxviii. 76].<br>\
(TA.) وَأُولِى الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ, in the Kur [iv. 62],<br>\
[And those, of you, who are possessors of command], (M, K, *) accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, (M,)<br>\
means the companions of the Prophet, and the<br>\
men of knowledge their followers, (M, K,) and<br>\
the possessors of command, who are their followers,<br>\
when also possessors of knowledge and religion:<br>\
(K:) or, as some say, [simply] the possessors<br>\
of command; for when these are possessors of<br>\
knowledge and religion, and take, or adopt and<br>\
maintain, and follow, what the men of knowledge<br>\
say, to obey them is of divine obligation: and<br>\
in general those who are termed أُولُو الأَمْرِ, of the<br>\
Muslims, are those who superintend the affairs of<br>\
such with respect to religion, and everything conducing to the right disposal of their affairs. (M.)<br>\
إِلَى, accord. to Sb, is originally with و in the<br>\
place of the [ى, i. e. the final] alif; and so is عَلَى; for<br>\
the alifs [in these two particles] are not susceptible<br>\
of imáleh; [i. e., they may not be pronounced<br>\
ilè and &#39;alè;] and if either be used as the proper<br>\
name of a man, the dual [of the former] is إِلَوَانِ<br>\
and [that of the latter] عَلَوَانِ; but when a pronoun is affixed to it, the alif is changed into yé,<br>\
so that you say إِلَيْكَ and عَلَيْكَ; though some of<br>\
the Arabs leave it as it was, saying إِلَاكَ and عَلَاكَ.<br>\
(S.) It is a prep., or particle governing a noun<br>\
in the gen. case, (S, Mughnee, K,) and denotes<br>\
the end, as opposed to [مِنْ, which denotes] the<br>\
beginning, of an extent, or of the space between<br>\
two points or limits; (S, M;) or the end of an<br>\
extent (T, Mughnee, K) of place; [signifying To,<br>\
or as far as;] as in the phrase [in the Kur xvii. 1],<br>\
مِنَ المَسْجِدِ الحَرَامِ إِلَى المَسْجِدِ الأَقْصَى [From<br>\
the Sacred Mosque to, or as far as, the Furthest<br>\
Mosque; meaning from the mosque of Mekkeh<br>\
to that of Jerusalem]; (Mughnee, K;) or in the<br>\
saying, خَرَجْتُ مِنَ الكُوفَةِ إِلَى مَكَّةَ [I went forth<br>\
from El-Koofeh to Mekkeh], which may mean<br>\
that you entered it, [namely, the latter place,] or<br>\
that you reached it without entering it, for the<br>\
end includes the beginning of the limit and the<br>\
furthest part thereof, but does not extend beyond<br>\
it. (S.) [In some respects it agrees with حَتَّى,<br>\
q. v. And sometimes it signifies Towards; as in<br>\
نَظَرَ إِلَىَّ He looked towards me; and مَالَ إِلَيْهِ<br>\
He, or it, inclined towards him, or it. ―<br>\
-b2-  It also<br>\
denotes the end of a space of time; [signifying To,<br>\
till, or until;] as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 183],<br>\
ثُمَّ أَتِمُّوا الصِّيَامَ إِلَى اللَّيْلِ [Then complets ye the<br>\
fasting to, or till, or until, the night]. (Mughnee,<br>\
K.) [Hence, إِلَى أَنْ (followed by a mansoob<br>\
aor.) Till, or until: and إِلَى مَتَى Till, or until,<br>\
what time, or when? i. e. how long? and also to,<br>\
till, or until, the time when. See also the last<br>\
sentence in this paragraph.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [In like manner<br>\
it is used in the phrases إِلَى غَيْرِ ذلِكَ, and إِلَى آخِرِهِ,<br>\
meaning, (And so on,) to other things, and to the<br>\
end thereof; equivalent to et cœtera.] ―<br>\
-b4-  Sometimes, (S,) it occurs in the sense of مَعَ, (T, S, M,<br>\
Mughnee, K,) when a thing is joined to another<br>\
thing; (Mughnee, K;) as in the phrase [in the<br>\
Kur iii. 45 and lxi. 14], مَنْ أَنْصَارِى إِلَى اللّٰهِ [Who<br>\
will be my aiders with, or in addition to, God?],<br>\
(S, Mughnee, K,) accord. to the Koofees and<br>\
some of the Basrees; (Mughnee;) i. e. who will<br>\
be joined to God in aiding me? (M, TA;) and<br>\
as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 2], وَلَا تَأْكُلُوا<br>\
أَمْوَالَهُمْ إِلَى أَمْوَالِكُمْ [And devour not ye their possessions with, or in addition to, your possessions];<br>\
(T, S;) and [in the same, ii. 13,] وَإِذَا خَلَوْا إِلَى<br>\
شَيَا طِينِهِمْ [And when they are alone with their<br>\
devils]; (S;) and in the saying, الذَّوْدُ إِلَى الذَّوْدِ إِبِلٌ<br>\
[A few she-camels with, or added to, a few she-camels are a herd of camels], (S, Mughnee, K,) a<br>\
prov., meaning (assumed tropical:)  a little with a little makes much;<br>\
(S and A in art. ذود, q. v.;) though one may not<br>\
say, إِلَى زَيْدٍ مَالٌ meaning مَعَ زَيْدٍ مَالٌ: (Mughnee:) so too in the saying, فُلَانٌ حَلِيمٌ إِلَى أَدَبٍ وَفِقْهٍ<br>\
[Such a one is clement, or forbearing, with good<br>\
education, or polite accomplishments, and intelligence, or knowledge of the law]; (M, TA;) and<br>\
so, accord. to Kh, in the phrase, أَحْمَدُ اللّٰهَ إِلَيْكَ<br>\
[I praise God with thee: but see another rendering of this phrase below]. (ISh.) In the<br>\
saying in the Kur [v. 8], فَاغْسِلُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ<br>\
إِلَى المَرَافِقِ, it is disputed whether [the meaning<br>\
be Then wash ye your faces, and your arms with<br>\
the elbows, or, and your arms as far as the<br>\
elbows; i. e., whether] the elbows be meant to be<br>\
included among the parts to be washed, or excluded therefrom. (T.) A context sometimes<br>\
shows that what follows it is included in what<br>\
precedes it; as in قَرَأْتُ القُرْآنَ مِنْ أَوَّلِهِ إِلَى آخِرِهِ<br>\
[I read, or recited, the Kurán, from the beginning<br>\
thereof to the end thereof]: or that it is excluded;<br>\
as in ثُمَّ أَتِمُّوا الصِّيَامَ إِلَى اللَّيْلِ [explained above]:<br>\
when this is not the case, some say that it is<br>\
included if it be of the same kind [as that which<br>\
precedes]; some, that it is included absolutely;<br>\
and some, that it is excluded absolutely; and this<br>\
is the right assertion; for with the context it is in<br>\
most instances excluded. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b5-  It is<br>\
also used to show the grammatical agency of the<br>\
noun governed by it, after a verb of wonder; or<br>\
after a noun of excess importing love or hatred;<br>\
[as in مَا أَحَبَّهُ إِلَىَّ How lovely, or pleasing, is he<br>\
to me! (TA in art. حب,) and مَا أَبْغَضَهُ إِلَىَّ How<br>\
hateful, or odious, is he to me! (S in art. بغض;)<br>\
and] as in the saying [in the Kur xii. 33], رَبِّ<br>\
السِّجْنُ أَحَبُّ إِلَىَّ [O my Lord, the prison is more<br>\
pleasing to me]. (Mughnee, K.) [This usage is<br>\
similar to that explained in the next sentence.] ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
It is syn. with عِنْدَ; (S, M, Mughnee, Msb, K;)<br>\
as in the phrase, هُوَ أَشْهَى إِلَىَّ مِنْ كَذَا [It is<br>\
more desirable, or pleasant, in my estimation than<br>\
such a thing]; (Msb;) and in the saying of the<br>\
poet,<br>\
أَمْ لَا سَبِيلَ إِلَى الشَّبَابِ وَذِكْرُهُ<br>\
أَشْهَى إِلَىَّ مِنَ الرَّحِيقِ السَّلْسَلِ<br>\
[Is there no way  of return to youth, seeing that<br>\
the remembrance thereof is more pleasant to me,<br>\
or in my estimation, than mellow wine?] (Mughnee, K:) and accord. to this usage of إِلَى in the<br>\
sense of عِنْدَ may be explained the saying, أَنْتِ<br>\
طَالِقٌ إِلَى سَنَةٍ, meaning Thou art divorced at the<br>\
commencement of a year. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b7-  It is also<br>\
syn. with لِ; as in the phrase, وَالأَمْرُ إِلَيْكَ [And<br>\
command, or to command, belongeth unto Thee,<br>\
meaning God, as in the Kur xiii. 30, and xxx. 3],<br>\
(Mughnee, K,) in a trad. respecting supplication:<br>\
(TA:) or, as some say, it is here used in the<br>\
manner first explained above, meaning, is ultimately referrible to Thee: and they say, أَحْمَدُ<br>\
اللّٰهَ إِلَيْكَ, meaning, I tell the praise of God unto<br>\
thee: (Mughnee:) [but see another rendering of<br>\
this last phrase above:] you say also, ذَاكَ إِلَيْكَ<br>\
That is committed to thee, or to thy arbitration.<br>\
(Har p. 329.) ―<br>\
-b8-  It also occurs as syn. with عَلَى;<br>\
as in the saying in the Kur [xvii. 4], وَقَضَيْنَا إِلَى<br>\
بَنِى إِسْرَائِيلَ [And we decreed against the children<br>\
of Israel]: (Msb:) or this means and we revealed<br>\
to the children of Israel (Bd, Jel) decisively.<br>\
(Bd.) ―<br>\
-b9-  It is also syn. with فِى; (M, Mughnee,<br>\
K;) as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 89 and vi.12],<br>\
لَيَجْمَعَنَّكُمْ إِلَى يَوْمِ القِيَامَةِ [He will assuredly collect you together on the day of resurrection]:<br>\
(K:) thus it may be used in this instance accord.<br>\
to Ibn-Málik: (Mughnee:) and it is said to be<br>\
so used in the saying [of En-Nábighah, (M,<br>\
TA,)]<br>\
فَلَا تَتْرُكَنِّى بِالوَعِيدِ كَأَنَّنِى<br>\
إِلَي النَّاسِ مَطْلِىٌّ بِهِ القَارُ أَجْرَبُ<br>\
[Then do not thou leave me with threatening, as<br>\
though I were, among men, smeared with tar,<br>\
being like a mangy camel]; (M, Mughnee;) or,<br>\
accord. to some, there is an ellipsis and inversion<br>\
in this verse; الى being here in dependence<br>\
upon a word suppressed, and the meaning being,<br>\
smeared with pitch, [like a camel,] yet being<br>\
united to men: or, accord. to Ibn-&#39;Osfoor, مطلىّ<br>\
is here considered as made to import the meaning<br>\
of rendered hateful, or odious; for he says that if<br>\
الى were correctly used in the sense of فى, it<br>\
it would be allowable to say, زَيْدٌإِلَى الكُوفَةِ:<br>\
(Mughnee:) [or the meaning may be, as though<br>\
I were, compared to men, a mangy camel, smeared<br>\
with pitch: for] I&#39;Ab said, after mentioning<br>\
&#39;Alee, عِلْمِى إِلَى عِلْمِهِ كَالقَرَارَةِ فِى المُثُعَنْجَرِ, meaning My knowledge compared to his knowledge is<br>\
like the قرارة [or small pool of water left by a<br>\
torrent] placed by the side of the middle of the<br>\
sea [or the main deep]. (K in art. ثعجر.) It is<br>\
also [said to be] used in the sense of فى in the<br>\
saying in the Kur [1xxix. 18], هَلْ لَكَ إِلَى أَنْ تَزَكَّى<br>\
[Wilt thou purify thyself from infidelity?] because it imports the meaning of invitation. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b10-  It is also used [in a manner contr. to its<br>\
primitive application, i. e.,] to denote beginning,<br>\
[or origination,] being syn. with مِنْ; as in the<br>\
saying [of a poet],<br>\
تَقُولُ وَقَدْ عَالَيْتُ بِالكُورِ فَوْقَهَا<br>\
أَيُسْقَي فَلَا يَرْوَى إِلَىَّ ابْنُ أَحْمَرَا<br>\
[She says, (namely my camel,) when I have<br>\
raised the saddle upon her, Will Ibn-Ahmar be<br>\
supplied with drink and not satisfy his thirst<br>\
from me? i. e., will he never be satisfied with<br>\
drawing forth my sweat?]. (Mughnee, K.) ―<br>\
-b11-  It<br>\
is also used as a corroborative, and is thus [syntactically] redundant; as in the saying in the Kur<br>\
[xiv. 40], فَاجْعَلْ أَفْئِدَةً مِنَ النَّاسِ تَهْوَى إِلَيْهِمْ, with<br>\
fet-h to the و [in تهوى], (Mughnee, K,) accord.<br>\
to one reading, (Mughnee,) meaning تَهْوَاهُمْ [i. e.<br>\
And make Thou hearts of men to love them]:<br>\
(K:) so says Fr: but some explain it by saying<br>\
that تهوى imports the meaning of تَمِيلُ; or that<br>\
it is originally تَهْوِى, with kesr, the kesreh being<br>\
changed to a fet-hah, and the yé to an alif, as<br>\
when one says رَضَا for رَضِىَ, and نَاصَاةٌ for نَاصِيَةٌ:<br>\
so says Ibn-Málik; but this requires consideration; for it is a condition in such cases that the<br>\
ى in the original form must be movent. (Mughnee.) [See art. هوى.] ―<br>\
-b12-  اَللّٰهُمَّ إِلَيْكَ, occurring<br>\
in a trad., [is elliptical, and] means O God, I complain unto Thee: or take Thou me unto Thee.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b13-  And أَنَا مِنْكَ وَإِلَيْكَ means I am of thee,<br>\
and related to thee. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b14-  You say also,<br>\
اِذْهَبْ إِلَيْكَ, meaning Betake, or apply, thyself<br>\
to, or occupy thyself with, thine own affairs. (T,<br>\
K. *) And similar to this is the phrase used by<br>\
El-Aashà, فَاذْهَبِى مَا إِلَيْكِ. (TA.) And إِلَيْكُمْ<br>\
[alone is used in a similar manner, elliptically, or<br>\
as an imperative verbal noun, and] means Betake,<br>\
or apply, yourselves to, or occupy yourselves with,<br>\
your own affairs, (اِذْهَبُوا إِلَيْكُمْ,) and retire ye,<br>\
or withdraw ye, to a distance, or far away, from<br>\
us. (ISk.) And إِلَيْكَ عَنِّى means Hold, or refrain, thou from me: (T, K:) or remove, withdraw, or retire, thou to a distance from me: اليك<br>\
used in this sense is an imperative verbal noun.<br>\
(Har p. 508.) Sb says, (M,) or Akh, (Har ubi<br>\
suprà,) I heard an Arab of the desert, on its being<br>\
said to him إِلَيْكَ, reply, إِلَىَّ; as though it were<br>\
said to him Remove, withdraw, or retire, thou to<br>\
a distance, and he replied, I will remove, &amp;c.<br>\
(M.) Aboo-Fir&#39; own says, satirizing a Nabathæan<br>\
woman of whom he asked for water to drink,<br>\
إِذَا طَلَبْتَ المَآءِ قَالَتْ لَيْكَا<br>\
[When thou shalt demand water, she will say,<br>\
Retire thou to a distance]; meaning, [by ليكا,<br>\
i. e. لَيْكَ with an adjunct alif for the sake of<br>\
the rhyme,] إِلَيْكَ, in the sense last explained<br>\
above. (M.) ―<br>\
-b15-  One also says, إِلَيْكَ كَذَا, meaning, Take thou such a thing. (T, K.) ―<br>\
-b16-  When<br>\
إِلَى is immediately followed by the interrogative<br>\
مَا, both together are written إِلَامَ [meaning, To<br>\
what? whither? and till, or until, what time,<br>\
or when? i. e. how long?]; and in like manner<br>\
one writes عَلَامَ for عَلَى مَا, (S * and K voce ما,)<br>\
and حَتَّامَ for حَتَّى. (S voce حَتَّى.)<br>\
أَلْوَةٌ and أُلْوَةٌ and إِلْوَةٌ: see أَلِيَّةٌ.<br>\
أَلىُّ One who swears much; who utters many<br>\
oaths: (IAar, T, K:) mentioned in the K in<br>\
art. الى; but the present is its proper art. (TA.)<br>\
أَلِيَّةٌ [A falling short; or a falling short of<br>\
what is requisite, or what one ought to do; or<br>\
a flagging, or remissness; and slowness, or tardiness:] a subst. from أَلَا as signifying قَصَّرَ and<br>\
أَلِيَّةً. (M.) Hence the prov., (M,) إِلَّا حَضِيَّةً فَلَا<br>\
أَلِيَّةً, i. e. If I be not in favour, and high estimation, I will not cease seeking, and labouring,<br>\
and wearying myself, to become so: (M, K: *)<br>\
or if thou fail of good fortune in that which<br>\
thou seekest, fall not short, or flag not, or be<br>\
not remiss, in showing love, or affection, to men;<br>\
may-be thou wilt attain somewhat of that which<br>\
thou wishest: originally relating to a woman<br>\
who becomes displeasing to her husband: (S in<br>\
art. حظو:) it is one of the proverbs of women:<br>\
one says, if I be not in favour, and high estimation, with my husband, I will not fall short, or<br>\
flag, or be remiss, in that which may render me<br>\
so, by betaking myself to that which he loveth:<br>\
(T and TA in art. حظو:) Meyd says that the<br>\
two nouns are in the accus. case because the<br>\
implied meaning is إِلَّا أَكُنْ حَظِيَّةً فَلَا أَكُنْ أَلِيَّةً;<br>\
the latter noun being [accord. to him] for ↓ آلِيَةٌ,<br>\
for which it may be put for the sake of conformity<br>\
[with the former]; and the former having the<br>\
signification of the pass. part. n. of أَحْظَى, or<br>\
that of the part. n. of حَظِىَ [or حَظِيَتْ]. (Har<br>\
p. 78.)<br>\
-A2-  An oath; (T, S, M, Mgh, K;) as also<br>\
↓ أَلِيَّا (M, K) and ↓ أَلْوَةٌ (T, S, M, K) and ↓ أُلْوَةً<br>\
and ↓ إِلِيوَةٌ: (S, M, K: [in the CK, والاُلُوَّةُ مُثَلَّثَةً<br>\
is erroneously put for والِأَلْوَةُ مثلّثةً:]) it is [originally أَلِيوَةٌ,] of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ: (S:) pl. أَلَايَا.<br>\
(S, Mgh.) A poet says, (namely, Kutheiyir, TA,)<br>\
قَلِيلُا الأَلَايَا حَافِظٌ لِيَمِينِهِ<br>\
وَإِنْ سَبَقَتْ مِنْهُ الأَلِيَّةُ بَرَّتِ<br>\
[A person of few oaths, who keeps his oath from<br>\
being uttered on ordinary or mean occasions;<br>\
but if the oath has proceeded from him at any<br>\
former time, or hastily, it proves true]: (S, TA:)<br>\
or, as IKh relates it, قَلِيلُ الإِلَآءِ; meaning, he<br>\
says, قَلِيلُ الإيلَآءِ; the ى being suppressed:<br>\
see 4. (TA.)<br>\
أَلِيَّا: see the latter part of the paragraph next<br>\
preceding.<br>\
آلٍ Falling short; or falling short of what<br>\
is requisite, or what one ought to do; or flagging,<br>\
or remiss: [and slow, or tardy: &amp;c.: see 1:]<br>\
fem. with ة: and pl. of this latter أَوَالٍ. (S, TA.)<br>\
See أَلِيَّةٌ, used, accord. to Meyd, for آلِيَة. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Niggardly, penurious, or avaricious; impotent<br>\
to fulfil duties or obligations, or to pay debts.<br>\
(Har p. 78.)<br>\
مِئْلَاةٌ The piece of rag which a woman holds<br>\
in wailing, (S, TA,) and with which she makes<br>\
signs: (TA:) [it is generally dyed blue, the<br>\
colour of mourning; and the woman sometimes<br>\
holds it over her shoulders, and sometimes twirls<br>\
it with both hands over her head, or before her<br>\
face:] pl. مَآلٍ: (S, TA:) which also signifies<br>\
rags used for the menses. (TA in art. غبر.)<br>\
مُتَأَلّ [part. n. of 5]. It is said in a trad.,<br>\
وَيْلٌ لِلْمُتَأَلِّينَ مِنْ أُمَّتِى, explained as meaning<br>\
Woe to those of my people who pronounce sentence against God, saying, Such a one is in<br>\
Paradise, and such a one is in the fire [of Hell]:<br>\
but see the verb. (TA.)<br>\
