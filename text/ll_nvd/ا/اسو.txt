أَسَا الجُرْحَ, (aor. يَأْسُو S,) inf. n. أَسْوٌ and<br>\
أَسًا, [but in the S, the latter seems to be mentioned as a simple subst.,] He dressed the wound;<br>\
treated it curatively, or surgically. (S, M, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] هٰذَ أَمْرٌ لَا يُؤْسَى كَلْمُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [This is<br>\
an affair of which the evil (lit. the wound) will<br>\
not be remedied]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] أَسَا بَيْنَهُمْ,<br>\
(first pers. أَسَوْتُ, S, Msb, inf. n. أَسْوٌ, S, M,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
made peace, effected a reconciliation, or adjusted<br>\
a difference, between them; (S, M, Msb, K;)<br>\
as also بينهم ↓ أسّى. (El-Muärrij, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  أَسِيَ<br>\
aor. يَأْسَي, inf. n. أَسًا or أَسًي, He grieved, or<br>\
mourned, (S, M, Msb, K,) عَلَيْهِ [for him, or it],<br>\
(M, K,) and عَلَى مُصِيبَةٍ [for an affliction], and<br>\
لِفُلَانٍ [for such a one]. (S.) [This belongs to<br>\
the present art. and to art. اسى; but is distinguished in the M and K by being mentioned only<br>\
in the latter art.; though the inf. n. is mentioned<br>\
in the K in both arts.] Hence the saying, الإِسَآءُ<br>\
يَدْفَعُ الأَسَا [Medicine dispels grief, or mourning]<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
أسّى بَيْنَهُمْ: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  أسّاهُ, (S, M, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَأْسِيَةٌ, (S, K,) i. q. عَزَّاهُ [He exhorted him, or enjoined him, to be patient; to take patience; or to<br>\
take example by, or console himself by the example<br>\
of, him who had suffered the like affliction]; (S,<br>\
M, K, TA;) saying to him, Wherefore dost thou<br>\
grieve, or mourn, when such a one is thine example<br>\
(إِسْوَتُكَ) ? i. e. what has befallen thee befell him,<br>\
and he was patient; therefore take thou example<br>\
by him and so be consoled (تَأَسِّ بِهِ). (TA.) You<br>\
say, أسّاهُ بِمُصِيبَةٍ i. e. عَزَّاهُ [He exhorted him, or<br>\
enjoined him, to be patient, &amp;c., by mentioning<br>\
an affliction that had befallen another; unless<br>\
بمصيتة be a mistranscription for لِمُصِيبَةٍ on<br>\
account of an affliction]; as also ↓ آساهُ, with<br>\
medd. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
آسِيْتُهُ بِمَالِى, (S, Mgh,) inf. n. مُؤَاسَاةٌ, (S,<br>\
M, K,) I made him my object of imitation<br>\
(إِسْوَتِى), [meaning I made myself like him,] in<br>\
respect of my property: (S:) or I made him an<br>\
object of imitation [with, or in respect of, my<br>\
property], I imitating his example, and he imitating my example: (Mgh:) and وَاسَيْتُهُ is a dial.<br>\
var., but of weak authority: (S, Mgh:) and<br>\
آسَانِى [alone] he made me an object of imitation<br>\
to him by giving me of his property [and thus<br>\
reducing himself to my condition in some degree<br>\
while in the same degree raising me to his]; (Ham<br>\
p. 696;) and أُوَاسِيهِ [thus without a second ء] I<br>\
make him the object of my own imitation and so<br>\
share with him my property: (Id p. 198:) or<br>\
آساهُ بِمَالِهِ signifies he gave him of his property,<br>\
and made him an object of imitation in respect of<br>\
it: or only, of food sufficient for his want; not<br>\
of what is superabundant: (M, K:) whence the<br>\
saying, رَحِمَ اللّٰهُ رَجُلًا أَعْطَى مِنْ فَضْلٍ وَوَاسَى مِنْ<br>\
كَفَافٍ [May God have mercy on a man who has<br>\
given of superabundance, and imparted of food<br>\
only sufficient for his want so as to make himself<br>\
equal with him to whom he imparts of such food]:<br>\
(TA:) [and آساهُ signifies he shared with him:<br>\
and he was, or became, equal with him: for]<br>\
المُوَاسَاةُ occurs often in trads., signifying the<br>\
sharing with another, or making another to share<br>\
with one, in the means of subsistence [&amp;c.]; and<br>\
is originally [المُؤَاسَاةُ,] with ء: also, the being, or<br>\
becoming, equal with another: (TA:) and you<br>\
say, آسَيْتُهُ بِنَفْسِي, meaning I made him equal with<br>\
myself; in the dial. of El-Yemen وَاسَيْتُهُ. (Msb.)<br>\
آسِ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ فِى وَجْهِكَ, in a letter of &#39;Omar,<br>\
means Make thou the people to share [alike], one<br>\
with another, in thy consideration and regard:<br>\
or, as some say, make thou them equal [in respect<br>\
thereof]. (Mgh.) The saying مَا يُؤَاسِي فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا<br>\
is explained in three different ways: accord. to<br>\
El-Mufaddal Ibn-Mohammad, it means Such a<br>\
one does not make such a one to share with him:<br>\
accord. to El-Muärraj, does not good to such a<br>\
one; from the saying of the Arabs, آسِ فُلَانًا بِخَيْرٍ<br>\
Do thou good to such a one: or, as some say,<br>\
does not give such a one any compensation for his<br>\
love, or affection, nor for his relationship; from<br>\
الأَوْسُ, meaning العَوْضُ; being originally يُؤَاوِسُهُ,<br>\
then يُؤَاسِوُهُ, and then يُؤَاسِيهِ: or it may be from<br>\
أَسَوْتُ الجُرْحَ. (IDrd, TA.) [See also an ex. voce<br>\
أَثَرَةٌ].<br>\
4<br>\
آساهُ: see 2.<br>\
5<br>\
تأسّى: see 8. ―<br>\
-b2-  I. q. تَعَزَّى [He took patience; or constrained himself to be patient; or<br>\
he took example by, or became consoled by the<br>\
example of, another who had suffered in like<br>\
manner and had been patient]. (S, M, K.) You<br>\
say, تأسّى بِهِ, i. e. تَعَزَّى بِهِ [He took patience, or<br>\
constrained himself to be patient, by reflecting<br>\
upon him, or it; or he took example by him, or<br>\
became consoled by his example, meaning the<br>\
example of a person who had suffered in like<br>\
manner and had been patient]. (S.) [See 2.]<br>\
6<br>\
تَآسَوْا signifies آسَى بَعْضُهُمْ بعْضًا [They imitated one another with their property, one giving<br>\
of his property to another, so that they thus<br>\
equalised themselves; they imitated one another<br>\
and so shared together their property; they<br>\
shared, one with another, in the means of subsistence, &amp;c.; they were, or became, equal, one with<br>\
another: see 3]. (S, K.) A poet says,<br>\
وَإِنَّ الأُولَى بِالطَّفِّ مِنْ آل هَاشِمٍ<br>\
تَآسَوْا فَسَنُّوا لِلْكِرَامِ التَّآسِيَا<br>\
(S,) in which تآسوا is from المُؤَاسَاةُ; not from<br>\
التَّأَسِّي, as it is stated to be by Mbr, who says<br>\
that تآسوا means تَوَاسَوْاا and تَعَزَّوْا. (IB, TA.)<br>\

أُلَى, q. v.]<br>\

ائتسى بِهِ [written with the disjunctive alif<br>\
اِيتَسَى] He imitated him; followed his example;<br>\
did as he did, following his example, or taking<br>\
him as an example, an exemplar, a pattern, or<br>\
an object of imitation; he took example by him;<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, TA;) as also بِهِ ↓ تأسّى: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) he made him an object of imitation (إِسْوَة)<br>\
[to himself]. (M, K.) One says لَا تَأْتَسِ بِمَنْ,<br>\
لَيْسَ لَكَ بِإِسْوَةٍ Do not thou imitate him who is not<br>\
for thee a [fit] object of imitation. (S, M. *)<br>\
Q. Q. 1<br>\
أَسْوَيْتُهُ بِهِ [I made him to imitate him,<br>\
to follow his example, or to take example by him;]<br>\
I made him an example, an exemplar, a pattern,<br>\
or an object of imitation, to him: (M, K:) from<br>\
IAar: and if from الإِسْوَةُ, as he asserts it be, the<br>\
measure of this verb is فَعْلَيْتُ, like دَرْبَيْتُ and<br>\
جَعْبَيْتُ. (M.)<br>\
أَسًا or أَسًى Curative, or surgical, treatment.<br>\
(S.) [See the verb أَسَا.]<br>\

أُسْوَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
إِسْوَةٌ and ↓ أُسْوَةٌ (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and<br>\
↓, أَسْوَةٌ, mentioned by Er-Rághib in one of his<br>\
works, (MF,) An example; an exemplar; a<br>\
pattern; an object of imitation; a person by<br>\
whom one takes example; syn. قُدْوَةٌ or قِدْوَةٌ; (S,<br>\
M, Msb, K;) each a subst. from اِيتَسَى بِهِ; (Mgh;)<br>\
i. e. مَا يُؤْتَسَى بِهِ: (TA:) explained by Er-Rághib<br>\
as meaning the condition in which is a man in<br>\
respect of another&#39;s imitating [him], whether<br>\
good or bad, pleasing or hurtful: (TA:) also<br>\
a thing [or person] by which one who is<br>\
in grief, or mourning, takes example, (S, K,)<br>\
for the being consoled (لِلتَّعَزِّى) thereby: (S:)<br>\
pl. إِسًى and أُسًى; (S, K;) the former of the<br>\
first sing., and the latter of the second. (TA.)<br>\
The first of these meanings is intended in the<br>\
saying, لِى فِي فُلَانٍ إِسْوَةٌ and أُسْوَةٌ [I have in<br>\
such a one an example, &amp;c.]. (S.) The saying,<br>\
مَا سَوِى التُّرَابِ مِنَ الأَرْضِ إِسْوَةُ التُّرَابِ is tropical,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  There is nothing but the dust of the<br>\
earth, or ground, that follows the dust. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\

K;) as also أَسْيَانُ and ↓ أَسٍ, (M in art. اسى,) or<br>\
↓ آسٍ (K in art. اسى [to which alone the first<br>\
of these three belongs, but the second and third<br>\
may be regarded as belonging either to that art.<br>\
or to the present,]) or ↓ أَسِىٌّ (Msb.) [See art.<br>\
اسى] It is [sometimes] followed by أَتْوَانُ [as<br>\
an imitative sequent corroborating its meaning].<br>\
(M.)<br>\
إِسَآءٌ and ↓ أَسُوٌّ A medicine, or remedy; (S, M,<br>\
K;) the latter, (S,) or each, (TA,) particularly<br>\
a vulnerary: (S, TA:) pl. [of each, as is indicated<br>\
