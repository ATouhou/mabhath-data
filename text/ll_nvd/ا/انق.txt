nicety, or refinement; he was dainty, nice, exquisite, refined, or scrupulously nice and exact; or<br>\

chose what was excellent, or best, to be done in it,<br>\
and did it admirably: (TA:) or he did it (namely,<br>\
his work, Msb) firmly, solidly, soundly, or thoroughly, (Msb, K,) and skilfully. (K: [but in<br>\
this last sense, &#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh allows only the<br>\
latter of these two verbs. TA in art. نوق.]) You<br>\
say also, تأنّق فُلَانٌ فِى الَّرَّوْضَةِ Such a one found<br>\
himself in the meadow, or garden, (وَقَعَ فِيهَا,)<br>\
pleased, or rejoiced, therewith: (S:) or he found<br>\
it pleasant or delightful, delighted in it, or took<br>\
pleasure or delight in it, and enjoyed its beauties:<br>\

it. (TA.) And تأنّق المَكَانَ He was pleased, or<br>\
rejoiced, with the place, and attached to it, not<br>\

in reading them, or reciting them, and enjoy their<br>\
beauties. (TA.)<br>\
أَنَقٌ inf. n. of 1 [q. v.] (Lth, JK, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence, A pleasing, or rejoicing, state, or condition.] You say, هُوَ فِى أَنَقٍ مِنْ عَيْشِهِ وَخِصْبٍ<br>\
[He is in a pleasing, or rejoicing, state, or condition, in respect of his life, and in a state of<br>\
plenty]. (JK.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Goodliness, or beauty, and<br>\
pleasingness, of aspect, or outward appearance:<br>\

مَا لَهُ فِى الشَّىْءِ أَنِقَةٌ He has no pleasure, or<br>\

أَنُوقٌ A certain bird; (S;) i. e. the رَخَمَة [or<br>\
female of the vultur percnopterus]; (IAar, S;)<br>\
called by Kumeyt ذَاتُ اسْمَيْنِ [possessor of two<br>\
names] because having these two appellations:<br>\
(S:) or the eagle: and also the former bird:<br>\
(K:) ISk cites &#39;Omárah as saying that it is in<br>\
his opinion the eagle; but that people say it is the<br>\
رخمة; and he adds, [alluding to a prov., which<br>\
see below,] that the eggs of the رخمة are found in<br>\
ruins, and in plain country: (TA:) or the male<br>\
of the رَخَم: (JK, TA:) or a certain black bird,<br>\
having what resembles the عُرْف [or comb of the<br>\
cock], (AA, K,) that deposits its eggs in remote<br>\
places: (AA:) or a certain black bird, (AA, K,)<br>\
like a great hen, (AA,) bald in the fore part of<br>\
the head, (AA, K,) having a yellow bill, (K,) or<br>\
having a long bill: (AA:) she guards her eggs,<br>\
and defends her young one, and keeps with her<br>\
offspring, and submits not herself to any but her<br>\
mate, and migrates among the first of the migrating<br>\
birds, and returns among the first of the returning<br>\
birds, and will not fly while moulting, and will<br>\
not be deceived by her small feathers but waits<br>\
until they become quills and then flies, and will<br>\
not remain constantly in the nests, and will not<br>\
alight upon the quiver (K) knowing it to contain<br>\
arrows: (TA:) the word is sing. and pl.: (TA:)<br>\
or its pl. is أُنُقٌ. (JK.) Hence the prov., (JK,<br>\
S,) أَعَزُّ مِنْ بَيْضِ الأَنُوقِ [More rare than the eggs<br>\
of the anook]: (JK, S, K:) because this bird<br>\
guards its eggs, so that they are hardly ever, or<br>\
never, found; for its nests are on the tops of<br>\
mountains, and in difficult and distant places; (S,<br>\
K;) notwithstanding which, it is said to be stupid:<br>\
(S:) ISd says that the female bird called رخمة<br>\
may be meant thereby; or the male, because the<br>\
eggs of the male exist not; or the eggs of the<br>\
latter may be meant because he often guards<br>\
them, like as does the male ostrich. (TA.)<br>\
أَنِيقٌ Goodly, or beautiful; (S, K;) pleasing,<br>\
or rejoicing; (JK, S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ أَنَقٌ:<br>\
(JK, TA:) and loved. (TA.) You say, رَوْضَةٌ أَنِيقٌ<br>\
A meadow, or garden, that is loved: and رَوْضَةٌ<br>\
أَنِيقَةٌ a meadow, or garden, that is pleasing, or<br>\
rejoicing. (TA.)<br>\
لَهُ إِنَاقَةٌ and أَنَاقَةٌ (K, and so in some copies of<br>\
the S,) He has goodliness, or beauty, and pleasingness: but in the L, [and in some copies of the S,]<br>\
لَهُ إِنَاقَةٌ وَلَبَاقةٌ; and what precedes it indicates that<br>\
the meaning is he has a faculty of doing well or<br>\
excellently [and of nice or refined skilfulness].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
آنَقُ [originally أأْنَقُ] More, or most, pleasing<br>\
or rejoicing. (TA.)<br>\
مُتَأَنِّقٌ [part. n. of 5; Seeking, pursuing, or<br>\
desiring, the most pleasing of things; affecting<br>\
nicety, or refinement; dainty, nice, exquisite,<br>\
refined, &amp;c.; in respect of food, apparel, speech,<br>\
&amp;c.:] one who is in a pleasing condition (فِى أَنَقٍ)<br>\
in respect of his life, and in a state of plenty.<br>\
(JK.) It is said in a prov., لَيْسَ المُتَعَلِّقُ كَالمُتَأَنِّقِ,<br>\
(JK, TA,) i. e. He who is content with what is<br>\
little, (S, K, in art. علق,) or what is barely sufficient, of sustenance, (TA in the present art.,) is<br>\
not like him who seeks, pursues, or desires, the<br>\
most pleasing of things, or who is dainty, &amp;c.,<br>\
(مَنْ يَتَأَنَّقُ,) and eats what he pleases, (S, K, in<br>\
art. علق,) or him who is not content save with the<br>\
most pleasing of things. (TA in the present art.)<br>\
