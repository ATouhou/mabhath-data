(Msb:) i. q. أُسْرُبُّ; (S, K;) i. e. رَصَاصٌ قَلْعِىٌّ;<br>\
so says Kt; and Az says, I think it is an arabicized word: (TA:) or white اسربّ: or black<br>\
اسربّ: or pure اسربّ: (K:) or i. q. قَزْدِيرٌ [which<br>\
is applied in the present day to tin, and pewter]:<br>\
(Kr:) El-Kásim Ibn-Maan says, I heard an<br>\
Arab of the desert say, هٰذَا رَصَاصٌ آنُكٌ, i. e. [this<br>\
is] pure [lead]: (TA:) it is of the measure أَفْعُلٌ,<br>\
[originally أَأْنُكٌ,] (S, K,) which is one of the<br>\
forms of pls., (S,) like أَفْلُسٌ; (Msb;) and there<br>\
is no other word of this measure, (Az, S, K,)<br>\
among sing. nouns, (Az, S,) except أَشُدٌّ [originally أَشْدُدٌ], (S, Sgh, K,) and آجُرٌ in the dial.<br>\
of those who pronounce it without teshdeed:<br>\
(Sgh:) it is disputed, however, whether أَشُدٌّ be<br>\
a sing. or a pl.: (Az, TA:) [and as to آجُرٌ, see<br>\
what follows:] or, accord. to some, (Msb,) آنُكٌ<br>\
is of the measure فَاعُلٌ, (Kr, Msb,) and is the only<br>\
word of that measure in Arabic: (Kr:) or it is<br>\
a foreign word; and so are آجُرٌ and [the proper<br>\
names] آمُلُ and كَابُلُ. (Msb.) It is said, in a<br>\
trad., that he who listens to a singing female<br>\
slave, آنُك shall be poured into his ears (S, TA)<br>\
on the day of resurrection. (TA.)<br>\
