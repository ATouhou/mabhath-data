آنَ, [aor. يَئِينُ,] inf. n. أَيْنٌ, [in a copy of the<br>\
Msb, أَيِنَ, aor. يَاءَنُ, inf. n. أَيَنٌ, but as this is at<br>\
variance with all other authorities known to me,<br>\
I regard it as a mistranscription,] He was, or<br>\
became, fatigued, or tired: (T, M:) so says IAar:<br>\
(T:) and As says the like: (TA, from a marginal<br>\
note in a copy of the S:) [see also what I have<br>\
cited from the Mughnee voce إِنَّ, last sentence:]<br>\
in proof of this, IAar cites the following ex., from<br>\
a poet:<br>\
إِنَّا وَرَبِّ القُلُصِ الضَّوَامِرِ<br>\
[We were, or have become, fatigued, by the Lord<br>\
of the lean and lank-bellied youthful she-camels]:<br>\
but Lth says that there is no verb derived from<br>\
أَيْنٌ, in this sense, except in poetry: (T:) Aboo-Mohammad says that the only instance is that<br>\
cited above: (TA:) [it is not disputed that] أَيْنٌ<br>\
signifies fatigue, or the being fatigued or tired:<br>\
(S, K:) AZ says that it has no verb formed from<br>\
it; but on this point he has been contradicted:<br>\
(S:) A &#39;Obeyd also says that it has no verb.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
-A2-  آنَ, aor. يَئِينُ, inf. n. أَيْنٌ, (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K, &amp;c., [but see what follows,]) also signifies Its<br>\
time came; (أَتَى وَقْتُهُ;) as also أَنَى: (Bd lvii. 15:)<br>\
it was, or became, present: it came, or attained,<br>\
to its time; to its full, or final, time, or state; to<br>\
maturity: it was, or became, or drew, near: syn.<br>\
أَنَى: (M:) and أَدْرَكَ; like أَنَى: (Ham p. 455:)<br>\
and حَانَ: (S, M, Msb, K:) and قَرُبَ. (Mughnee<br>\
voce إِنَّ.) You say, آنَ لَكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا, aor.<br>\
and inf. n. as above, (AZ, S,) i. e. حَانَ [The time<br>\
has come, or has drawn near, for thee to do, or<br>\
that thou shouldst do, such a thing]; like أَنَى:<br>\
and it is formed from it by transposition: (S:)<br>\
[i. e.] أَنَى is formed by transposition from آنَ:<br>\
(Msb:) or آنَ is a dial. var. of أَنَى; not formed<br>\
from it by transposition, [nor is the reverse the<br>\
case,] because of the existence of the inf. n. [of<br>\
each]: (M:) or آنَ is formed by transposition<br>\
from أَنَى, because the latter has an inf. n. and the<br>\
former has not: so says As: for أَيْنٌ does not<br>\
belong to this; its meaning being only إِعْيَآءٌ and<br>\
تَعَبٌ: or, accord. to AZ, آنَ has an inf. n., namely<br>\
أَيْنٌ; and if the case be so, the two [verbs] are<br>\
equal; neither being the original of the other:<br>\
(IJ in the Khasáïs:) Suh, in the R, asserts that<br>\
آنَ is formed by transposition from أَنَى: (TA:)<br>\
the assertion of El-Bekree, that آنَ is originally<br>\
with و [for its medial radical letter], and that it is<br>\
of the class of وَلِىَ, aor. يَلِى, requires consideration, and involves what is contrary to rule. (MF.)<br>\
You say also, آنَ أَيْنُكَ, (S, M, K,) and إِينُكَ, (M,<br>\
K,) and آنُكَ, (S, K,) i. e. حَانَ حِينُكَ [Thy time,<br>\
or season, came, or hath come: or drew near, or<br>\
hath drawn near]. (S, M, K.)<br>\
آنٌ: see أَيْنٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  الْآنَ is a noun denoting the<br>\
present time; (S, M, Msb, K;) [signifying At<br>\
the present time; now; for] it is an adverbial<br>\
noun; (S, Msb, K;) one which, in a place where<br>\
it is fitting to be used as such, may not be used<br>\
otherwise; occurring in a determinate sense; (S,<br>\
K;) the ال being inseparable from it; (IJ, M,<br>\
Msb;) not prefixed to it for the purpose of rendering it determinate, because it has not that<br>\
which participates in its meaning: (S, Msb, K:)<br>\
as Ibn-Es-Sarráj says, there is not one آن and<br>\
another آن: (Msb:) [accord. to ISd, who quotes<br>\
a long disquisition by IJ on this word,] the ال<br>\
which is expressed in this case is redundant,<br>\
because the noun is determinate without it, but it<br>\
is rendered so by another ال, which is understood,<br>\
as in the case of أَمْسِ: so says IJ, following<br>\
Aboo-&#39;Alee; and his is the correct opinion: (M:)<br>\
Fr says that it is a particle, compounded with ال,<br>\
which is inseparable from it; and that it is<br>\
originally أَوَانَ [or الْأَوَانَ]: or that it may have<br>\
originated from the phrase آنَ لَكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ [explained above], and is therefore mansoob, like<br>\
قِيلَ and قَالَ when used as nouns: but Zj disallows<br>\
its originating from آنَ; and says that the right<br>\
opinion is that of Kh, that الْآنَ is indecl. with<br>\
fet-h for its termination, and that the ال is prefixed because the meaning is هٰذَا الوَقْت; and<br>\
this is the opinion of Sb. (T.) You say, أَنَا الْآنَ<br>\
أَفْعَلُ كَذَا [I, at the present time, or now, do,<br>\
or will do, thus, or such a thing]. (M.) And<br>\
كُنْتُ الْآنَ عِنْدَهُ, meaning I was, in this time, of<br>\
which part is present and some portions have<br>\
passed, with him, or in his presence. (IJ, M.)<br>\
And when you mean the kind of expression<br>\
which is used in this saying, you say, اَلْآنُ حَدُّ<br>\
الزَّمَانَيْنِ [The term “ now ” is the limit of the two<br>\
times; namely the past and the future]; thus<br>\
pronounced, marfooa: so says IJ: but in the<br>\
Book of Sb we read, الآنَ حَدُّ الزَّمَانَيْنِ, with<br>\
nasb: and in like manner, in the same, الآنَ آنُكَ<br>\
[Now is thy time]; the former with nasb and the<br>\
latter with refa. (M.) You say also, هٰذَا أَوَانُ<br>\
الْآنَ [This is the present time]: and مَا جِئْتُ إِلَّا<br>\
أَوَانَ الْآنَ, meaning I came not save at the present<br>\
time, or now: with the last word mansoob in both<br>\
instances. (ISh, T.) [And إِلَى الْآنَ and حَتَّى الْآنَ<br>\
To the present time and until the present time;<br>\
i. e. hitherto. And مِنَ الْآنَ From the present<br>\
time; henceforward.] Sometimes the hemzeh<br>\
[after the ل] is suppressed, and its vowel is transferred to the ل; so that you say الَانَ. (Bd ii. 66.)<br>\
And sometimes also the ل is pronounced with<br>\
fet-h and both the hemzehs are suppressed; so<br>\
that you say لَانَ. (S, K.) And sometimes تَ<br>\
is prefixed to it, like as it is to حِينَ; so that you<br>\
say تَلَانَ, like as you say تَحِينَ. (El-Umawee,<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd. [See art. تلن.])<br>\
أَيْنٌ Fatigue. (S, K, &amp;c.) [Whether it be a<br>\
simple subst., or an inf. n., and, if the latter,<br>\
whether it be an inf. n. of آنَ only in the former<br>\
of the two senses assigned to that verb above, or<br>\
in both these senses, is doubted: see 1, throughout.]<br>\
-A2-  A time; a season; syn. حِينٌ; (S, M,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ إِينٌ (M, K) and ↓ آنٌ. (S, K.)<br>\
[See 1, last sentence.]<br>\
أَيْنَ is an adverbial noun, (Msb,) an interrogative respecting a place: (S, M, Msb, K:) [signifying Where? in what place?]: Zj says that it<br>\
is an interrogative particle, like كَيْفَ: (T:) [ISd<br>\
says,] it is a noun, because you say, مِنْ أَيْنَ<br>\
[meaning From what place? whence?]: (M:)<br>\
[and you say also, إِلَى أَيْنَ To what place?<br>\
whither?]: it is always mansoob, unless you<br>\
prefix the article to it, saying الأَيْنُ [which means<br>\
The place where]: (Lth, T:) it is fem.; but may<br>\
be made masc. (Lh, M.) You say, أَيْنَ زَيْدٌ<br>\
Where, or in what place, is Zeyd? (S, Msb.)<br>\
And أَيْنَ بَيْتُكَ [Where is thy house, or tent?].<br>\
(M.) And أَيْنَ يُذْهَبُ بِكَ, which may mean<br>\
Where, or whither, wilt thou be taken away, and<br>\
what will be done with thee and made to come to<br>\
pass with thee, if this be thine intellect? or,<br>\
accord. to Mtr, it is a saying of the people of<br>\
Baghdád, addressed to him whom they charge<br>\
with foolish judgment or opinion, as meaning<br>\
أَيْنَ يُذْهَبُ بِعَقْلِكَ [Where, or whither, is thine<br>\
intellect taken away?]. (Har p. 574.) [And<br>\
أَيْنَ هٰذَا مِنْ ذَاكَ and عَنْ ذَاكَ and وَ ذَاكَ What<br>\
place does this hold in relation to that, or in comparison with that? what is this in relation to<br>\
that, or in comparison with that? what has this<br>\
to do with that? what has this in common with<br>\
that?] ―<br>\
-b2-  It also denotes a condition: when you<br>\
say, أَيْنَ تَجْلِسْ أَجْلِسْ [Where thou sittest, I will<br>\
sit], the sitting must be in one place: and مَا is<br>\
added to it; so that you say, أَيْنَمَا تَقُمْ أَقُمْ [Wherever thou standest, I will stand]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It<br>\
also occurs used as a proper name of a particular<br>\
place: thus the poet Homeyd Ibn-Thowr speaks<br>\
of his companions as being بِأَيْنَ وَ أَيْنَمَا [app.<br>\
meaning In certain places: where and wherever<br>\
those places were, there were my companions]: in<br>\
which case it is divested of the meaning of an<br>\
interrogative, and is imperfectly decl. because<br>\
determinate and of the fem. gender. (M, L. [In<br>\
one copy of the former, بِأَنَّى وَ أَيْنَمَا, which may<br>\
mean the same; and voce أَىٌّ, q. v., بِأَىَّ وَ أَيْنَمَا.])<br>\
إِينٌ: see أَيْنٌ.<br>\
أَيَّانَ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) of the measure فَعَّال, or<br>\
it may be of the measure فَعْلَان, (Msb,) also pronounced ↓ إِيَّانَ, (T, S, M, K,) the latter of the<br>\
dial. of Suleym, mentioned by Fr, (T, S,) and by<br>\
Zj, (M,) is an interrogative respecting a time, (T,<br>\
S, Msb,) but only respecting a time not come:<br>\
(T:) signifying When? (S, M, Msb;) at what<br>\
time? (Msb, K:) it is fem.; but may be made<br>\
masc.: (Lh, M:) and it may be pronounced with<br>\
imáleh, though not belonging to a class of words<br>\
regularly subject to imáleh. (TA.) It is said in<br>\
the Kur [xvi. 22 and xxvii. 67], accord. to different readings, أَيَّانَ يُبْعَثُونَ or ↓ إِيَّانِ [When they<br>\
shall be raised to life]; (T, S, M;) i. e. when<br>\
shall be the resurrection. (Aboo-Is-hák, T.) But<br>\
you may not say, أَيَّانَ فَعَلْتَ ذَاكَ as meaning<br>\
When didst thou that? (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  IJ says that,<br>\
were it syn. with مَتَى, it would be conditional;<br>\
whereas it was not mentioned by his colleagues<br>\
among the adverbs used conditionally, as مَتَى and<br>\
أَيْنَ &amp;c.: but sometimes it has a conditional<br>\
meaning, though that meaning be not explicit.<br>\
(M.) A poet says,<br>\
أَيَّانَ نُؤْمِنْكَ تَأْمَنْ غَيْرَنَا وَ إِذَا<br>\
لَمْ تُدْرِكِ الأَمْنَ مِنَّا لَمْ تَزَلْ حَذِرَا<br>\
[When we grant thee security, thou wilt be secure<br>\
from others than us; and when thou obtainest<br>\
not security from us, thou wilt not cease to be in<br>\
a state of fear]. (I &#39;Ak p. 300.)<br>\
إِيَّانَ: see أَيَّانَ, in two places.<br>\
آئِنٌ part. n. of آنَ in both its senses.<br>\
