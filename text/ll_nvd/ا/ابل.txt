&#39;Abbád, K.) ―<br>\
-b4- نَاقَةٌ أبِلَةٌ A she-camel blessed,<br>\

of offspring. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.) In one place in<br>\

أُبُلٌ [mentioned in two places in the latter part<br>\
of the first paragraph,] The خِلْفَة of herbage,<br>\
(K,) i. e., of dry herbage; [app. meaning what<br>\
grows in the season called الصَّيْف, or summer,<br>\
among herbage that has dried up;] growing after<br>\
a year; upon which camels, or the like, fatten.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
إِبِلٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) said by Sb to be<br>\
the only subst. of this form except حِبِرٌ, and to<br>\
have none like it among epithets except بِلِزٌ; for<br>\
though other instances are mentioned, they are<br>\
not of established authority; (Msb;) but IJ<br>\
mentions, with these, حِبِكٌ and إِطِلٌ [which may<br>\
be of established authority]; (TA;) [and to these<br>\
may be added إِبِطٌ and إِبِدٌ, and perhaps نِكِحٌ and<br>\
خِطِبٌ; respecting which see إِبِدٌ;] and for إِبِلٌ<br>\
one says also ↓ إِبلٌ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) sometimes,<br>\
by way of contraction; (S, Msb;) or this may be<br>\
a dial. var. of the former; (Kr, MF;) [Camels:<br>\
and a herd of camels: or] at the least, applied to<br>\
a صِرْمَة; i. e. a number [of camels] more than a<br>\
ذَوْد [which is at least nine,] up to thirty; after<br>\
which is the هَجْمَة, i. e. forty and upwards; and<br>\
then, هُنَيْدَةُ, which is a hundred of إِبِل: (T:) or,<br>\
accord. to Ibn-&#39;Abbád, a hundred of إِبِل: (TA:)<br>\
it is a quasi-pl. n.; (Az, S, ISd, Z, O, Msb, &amp;c.;)<br>\
a word having no proper sing.; (S, M, O, Msb;)<br>\
and is of the fem. gender, because the quasi-pl. n.<br>\
that has no proper sing. is necessarily fem. (S, O,<br>\
Msb) when not applied to human beings, (S, O,)<br>\
or when applied to irrational beings, (Msb,) and<br>\
has ة added in the dim.; (S, Msb;) the dim. of<br>\
إِبِلٌ being ↓ أُبَيْلَةٌ: (S, Msb, K:) it is said in the<br>\
K that it is a sing. applied to a pl. number, and<br>\
is not a pl., nor a quasi-pl. n.; but in this assertion together with the saying that the dim. is as<br>\
above is a kind of contradiction; for if it be a<br>\
sing., and not a quasi-pl. n., what is the reason<br>\
of its being fem.? (TA:) the pl. is آبَالٌ (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K) and أَبِيلٌ [like عَبِيدٌ pl. of عَبْدٌ, q. v.];<br>\
(Msb, TA;) the pl. meaning herds [of camels];<br>\
and in like manner أَغْنَامٌ and أَبْقَارٌ mean flocks<br>\
of sheep or goats and herds of bulls or cows:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) and the dual, إِبلَانِ, means two<br>\
herds [of camels], (Sb, T, S, M, Msb,) each with<br>\
its pastor; (T;) like as غَنَمَانِ means two flocks<br>\
of sheep or goats: (S:) or, accord. to Ibn-&#39;Abbád,<br>\
the dual means two hundreds of إِبِل. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
الإِبِلُ الصُّغْرَى [The smaller camels] is an appellation applied to sheep; because they eat more than<br>\
goats. (IAar in TA art. ضبط.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is said in the<br>\
Kur [lxxxviii. 17], أَفَلَا يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَى الْإِبِلِ كَيْفَ<br>\
خُلِقَتْ, meaning, accord. to &#39;Aboo-Amr Ibn-El-<br>\
&#39;Alà, (T, TA,) (tropical:)  [Will they not then consider]<br>\
the clouds that bear the water for rain, [how they<br>\
are created?] (T, K, TA:) but accord. to him<br>\
who reads الإِبْلِ, the meaning is, the camels. (T,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
أُبْلَةٌ A blight, blast, taint, or the like: (T, K:)<br>\
thus written by IAth, agreeably with the authority<br>\
of Aboo-Moosà; (TA;) occurring in a trad., in<br>\
which it is said that one should not sell dates<br>\
until he is secure from الاُبْلَةٌ; (T, TA;) but<br>\
accord. to a commentary on the Nh, it is correctly<br>\
written ↓ أَبَلَةٌ [q. v.] (TA.)<br>\
إِبْلَةٌ Enmity; hostility. (Kr, M, K.)<br>\
أَبَلَةٌ Unwholesomeness and heaviness of food;<br>\
(S, M, K;) originally وَبَلَةٌ, like as أَحَدٌ is originally وَحَدٌ; (S;) as also ↓ أَبَلٌ. (K.) It is said<br>\
in a trad. that this departs from every property<br>\
for which the poor-rate has been paid. (S, M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also أُبْلَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  An evil quality of herbage or<br>\
pasture. (AHn, TA in art. نشر.) ―<br>\
-b4-  A cause<br>\
of harm or injury; evil; mischief. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
A consequence of an action, or a claim which<br>\
one seeks to obtain for an injury; and a cause<br>\
of blame or dispraise: having these meanings in<br>\
the saying, إِنْ فَعَلْتَ ذَاكَ فَقَدْ خَرَجْتَ مِنْ أَبَلَتِهِ<br>\
[If thou do that, thou wilt escape from its consequence, &amp;c.]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b6-  A fault, vice, or the like.<br>\
(Aboo-Málik, T.) So in the saying, مَا عَلَيْكَ فِى<br>\
هٰذَا الأَمْرِ أَبَلَةٌ [There is not to be charged against<br>\
thee, in this affair, any fault, &amp;c.]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b7-  A<br>\
crime; a sin; an unlawful action. (K.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
Rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite. (IB.)<br>\

means of the نَاقُوس; (A Heyth, M, * K;) the<br>\
beater of the ناقوس: (IDrd:) as also ↓ أَيْبَلِىٌّ,<br>\
(M and K, but according to the M as meaning<br>\
“ a monk,”) which is either a foreign word, or<br>\
changed by the relative ى, or of the same class<br>\
as إِنْقَحْلٌ [in which the first letter as well as th<br>\
second is augmentative], for Sb says that there is<br>\
not in the language an instance of the measure<br>\
فَيْعَلٌ; (M;) and ↓ أَيْبُلِىٌّ, and هَيْبَلِىٌّ, and ↓ أَبُلِىٌّ<br>\
and ↓ أَيْبَلٌ, (K,) which last is disallowed by Sb<br>\
for the reason stated above; (TA;) and ↓ أَيْبُلٌ<br>\
like أَيْنُقٌ; and ↓ أَيْبِلِىٌّ; (K;) the last with fet-h<br>\
to the hemzeh, and kesr to the ب, and with the<br>\
[first] ى quiescent; or أَيْبَلِىٌّ [app. a mistranscription for أَيْبِلِىٌّ] is used by poetic licence for ↓ أَبِيلِىٌّ,<br>\
like أَيْنُقٌ for أَنْوُقٌ: (TA:) pl. آبَالٌ (M, K) and<br>\
أُبْلٌ, or أُبُلٌ, [accord. to different copies of the<br>\
K,] with damm [which indicates that the former<br>\
is meant, though it is irregular]. (K.) By<br>\
أَبِيلٌ الأَبِيلِينَ is meant &#39;Eesà [or Jesus], (S, K,)<br>\
the Messiah. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In the Syriac language it<br>\
signifies Mourning, or sorrowing. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
A staff, or stick. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also إِبَالَةٌ.<br>\
أُبَالَة: see the next paragraph.<br>\

فِعَّالَةٌ, with ة, but only in one without ة, as in<br>\
the cases of دِينَارٌ and قِيرَاطٌ; (TA;) and وَبِيلَةٌ<br>\

(TA.) Hence the prov., (S, TA,) صِغْثٌ عَلَى<br>\
إِبَالَةٍ and ↓ إِبَّالَةٍ, (S, K, &amp;c.,) but the former is the<br>\
more common, and ↓ إِيبَالَةٍ, which is allowed by<br>\

it signifies a bird separating itself from the row<br>\
