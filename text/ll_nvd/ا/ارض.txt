الأَرْضُ [The earth;] that whereon are mankind:<br>\
(TA:) [and earth, as opposed to heaven: and the<br>\
ground, as meaning the surface of the earth, on<br>\
which we tread and sit and lie; and the floor:<br>\
without ال signifying a land, or country: and<br>\
a piece of land or ground: and land, or soil, or<br>\
ground, considered in relation to its quality:] it is<br>\
fem.: (S, A, Msb, K:) and is a coll. gen. n.; (S,<br>\
A, K;) of which the n. un. should be أَرْضَةٌ, but<br>\
this they did not say: (S:) or a pl. having no<br>\
sing.; (A, K;) for أَرْضَةٌ has not been heard:<br>\
(K:) its pl. is أَرَضَاتٌ, (S, K,) in [some of] the<br>\
copies of the K أَرْضَاتٌ, (TA,) for they sometimes<br>\
form the pl. of a word which has not the fem. ة<br>\
with ا and ت, as in the instance of عُرُسَاتٌ; (S;)<br>\
and أَرَضُونَ, [which is more common,] (AZ, AHn,<br>\
S, Mgh, Msb, K,) with fet-h to the ر, (AZ, AHn,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) and with و and ن, though a fem.<br>\
has not its pl. formed [regularly] with و and ن<br>\
unless it is of the defective kind, like ثُبَةٌ and ظُبَةٌ,<br>\
but they have made the و and ن [in this instance]<br>\
a substitute for the ا and ت which they have<br>\
elided [from أَرَضَاتٌ], and have left the fet-hah of<br>\
the ر as it was; (S;) but they also said أَرْضُونَ,<br>\
(AZ, AHn, S,) sometimes, making the ر quiescent;<br>\
(S;) and أُرُوضٌ (AZ, AHn, Msb, K) is sometimes<br>\
used as a pl., as in the saying مَا أَكْثَرَ أُرُوضَ بَنِى<br>\
فُلَانٍ [How many are the lands of the sons of<br>\
such a one!]; (TA;) and another [and very<br>\
common] pl. is [أَرَاضٍ, with the article written]<br>\
الأَرَاضِى, contr. to rule, (S, Msb, K,) as though<br>\
they had formed a pl. from آرُضٌ; (S;) thus<br>\
written in all the copies of the S; [accord. to SM;<br>\
but in one copy of the S, I find كَأَنَّهُمْ جَمَعُوا ااراضًا;<br>\
and in another, ارضًا;] and in one copy [is added],<br>\
“ thus it is found in his [J&#39;s] handwriting; ” but<br>\
IB says that correctly he should have said أَرْضَى,<br>\
like أَرْطَى; for as to آرُضٌ, its regular pl. would<br>\
be أَوَارِضُ; and [SM says] I have found it<br>\
observed in a marginal note to the S that the pl.<br>\
of آرُضٌ would be أَآرِضُ, like as أَكَالِبُ is pl. of<br>\
أَكْلُبٌ; and wherefore did he not say that الاراضى<br>\
is a pl. of an unused sing., like لَيَالٍ and أَهَالٍ, so<br>\
that it is as though it were pl. of أَرْضَاةٌ, like as<br>\
لَيَالٍ is pl. of لَيْلَاةٌ? yet if any one should propose<br>\
the plea that it may be formed by transposition<br>\
from أَآرِضُ, he would not say what is improbable;<br>\
its measure being in this case أَعَالِفُ; the word<br>\
being أَرَاضِئُ, and the ء being changed into ى:<br>\
(TA:) accord. to Abu-l-Khattáb, (S,) آرَاضٌ is<br>\
also a pl. of أَرْضٌ, (S, K,) like as آهَالٌ is a pl. of<br>\
أَهْلٌ; (S;) but IB says that, in the opinion of<br>\
the critics, the truth with respect to what is<br>\
related on the authority of Abu-l-Khattáb is, that<br>\
from أَرْضٌ and أَهْلٌ are formed أَرَاضٍ and أَهَالٍ, as<br>\
though they were pls. of أَرْضَاةٌ and أَهْلَاةٌ; like as<br>\
they said لَيْلَةٌ and لَيَال, as though this were pl. of<br>\
لَيْلَاةٌ. (TA.) It is said in proverbs, أَجْمَعُ مِنَ<br>\
الأَرْضِ [More comprehensive than the earth]:<br>\
(TA:) and آمَنُ مِنَ الأَرْضِ [More trustworthy<br>\
than the earth, in which treasures are securely<br>\
buried]: and أَشَدُّ مِنَ الأَرْضِ [Harder than the<br>\
earth, or ground]: (A, TA:) and أَذَلُّ مِنَ الأَرْضِ<br>\
[More vile, or more submissive, than the earth, or<br>\
ground]. (TA.) And you say, مَنْ أَطَاعَنِى كُنْتُ<br>\
لَهُ أَرْضَا (tropical:)  [Whoso obeyeth me, I will be to him as<br>\
ground whereon one treads]; denoting submissiveness. (A, TA.) And فُلَانٌ إِنٌ ضُرِبَ فَأَرْضٌ (tropical:)  [Such<br>\
one, if he be beaten, is like ground]; i. e. he cares<br>\
not for beating. (A, TA.) One says also, لَا أَرْضَ<br>\
لَكَ [Mayest thou have no land, or country! or<br>\
thou hast no land, or country]; like as one says,<br>\
لَا أُمَّ لَكَ. (S, K,) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] هُوَ ابْنُ أَرْضٍ<br>\
He is a stranger, (A, K, TA,) of whom neither<br>\
father nor mother is known. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اِبْنُ الأَرْضِ<br>\
[with the art. ال prefixed to the latter word] is A<br>\
certain plant, (AHn, K,) which comes forth upon<br>\
the summits of the [hills called] آكَام, having a<br>\
stem (أَصْل), but not growing tall, (AHn,) which<br>\
resembles hair, and is eaten, (AHn, K,) and<br>\
quickly dries up; (AHn;) a species of بَقْل, as<br>\
also بِنْتُ الأَرْضِ: (S in art. بنى:) and بَنَاتُ الأَرْضِ<br>\
plants: (M in art. بسر:) and the places which are<br>\
concealed from the pastor. (S in that art.) Also<br>\
The pool that is left by a torrent: (T in art. بنى:)<br>\
and بَنَاتُ الأَرْضِ pools in which are remains of<br>\
water: (IAar in TA art. بسر:) and rivulets. (T<br>\
in art. بنى.) ―<br>\
-b4-  أَرْضٌ is also used to signify (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
carpet; or anything that is spread: and in this<br>\
sense, in poetry, it is sometimes made masc.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  Anything that is low. (S, K.)<br>\
And (tropical:)  The lower, or lowest, part of the legs of a<br>\
horse or the like: (S, K:) or the legs of a camel<br>\
or of a horse or the like: and the part that is<br>\
next to the ground thereof. (TA.) You say<br>\
بَعِيرٌ شَدِيدُ الأَرْضِ (tropical:)  A camel strong in the legs.<br>\
(TA.) And فَرَسٌ بَعِيدٌ مَا بَيْمَ أَرْضِهِ وَسَمَائِهِ (tropical:)  A<br>\
horse that is large and tall. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also,<br>\

below, (lit. after,) them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And of a<br>\
sandal, (assumed tropical:)  [The lower surface of the sole;] the<br>\
part that touches the ground. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  A febrile<br>\
shivering; a tremor: (S, K:) or vertigo: or it<br>\
signifies also vertigo arising from a relaxed state,<br>\
and occasioning a defluxion from the nose and eyes.<br>\
(TA.) I&#39;Ab is related to have said, on the occasion of an earthquake, أَزُلْزِلَتِ الأَرْضُ أَمْ بِى أَرْضٌ,<br>\
(S,) i. e. [Hath the earth been made to quake, or<br>\
is there in me] a tremor? or a vertigo? (TA.)<br>\
[أَهْلُ الأَرْضِ signifies A certain class of the jinn,<br>\
or genii; by whom human beings are believed to<br>\
be possessed, and affected by an involuntary tremor; whence it seems that this appellation may<br>\
perhaps be from أَرْضٌ as signifying “ a tremor. ”<br>\
See مَأْرُوضٌ: and see خَبَلٌ, as explained in the S.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also Rheum; syn. زُكَامٌ: (S, K:) in this<br>\

in the days of the [season called] رَبِيع: (TA:)<br>\
there are two kinds: one kind is small, like the<br>\
large of the ذَرّ [or grubs of ants]; and this is the<br>\
bane of wood in particular: (AHn, TA:) or this<br>\
kind is the bane of wood and of other things, and<br>\
is a white worm with a black head, not having<br>\
wings, and it penetrates into the earth, and builds<br>\
for itself a habitation of clay, or soil; and this<br>\
is said to be that which ate the staff of Solomon<br>\
[as is related in the Kur xxxiv. 13, where it is<br>\
called دَابَّةُ الأَرْضِ, as is said in the A]: (TA:) the<br>\
other kind [is the termite, or white ant; termes<br>\
fatale of Linn.; called by Forskål (in his Descr.<br>\
Animalium &amp;c., p. 96,) termes arda, destructor;<br>\
and this] is like a large common ant, having wings;<br>\
it is the bane of everything that is of wood, and<br>\
of plants; except that it does not attack what is<br>\
moist, or succulent; and it has legs: (AHn, TA:)<br>\
the pl. is ↓ أَرَضٌ (AHn, Msb, TA) and أَرَضَاتٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) or, as some [more properly] say, أَرَضٌ is<br>\
a quasi-pl. [or coll. gen.] n. (AHn, TA.) It<br>\

a substitute for the ع. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَرِيضٌ is also<br>\
an imitative sequent to عَرِيضٌ; (S, K;) as in<br>\
the phrase أَرِيضٌ شَىْءٌ عَرِيضٌ [A very wide thing]:<br>\
(S:) or it signifies fat, as an epithet: (K:) some<br>\
use it in this sense without عرِيض, applied to a kid.<br>\
(S.) And you say, اِمْرَأَةٌ عَرِيضَةٌ أَرِيضَةٌ [A very wide,<br>\
or wide and fat, woman; or, as seems to be indicated in the TA in art. عرَض, prolific and perfect];<br>\
