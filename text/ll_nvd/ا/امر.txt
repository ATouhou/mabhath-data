أَمَرَهُ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
اَمُرَ, (M, &amp;c.,) inf. n.<br>\
أَمْرٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and إِمَارٌ, (M, L, K,)<br>\
which latter, however, is disapproved by MF,<br>\
(TA,) and إِيمَارٌ is syn. therewith, (K,) but this<br>\
also is disapproved by MF, and deemed by him<br>\
strange, [being by rule the inf. n. of ↓ آمَرَهُ, respecting which see what follows,] (TA,) and آمِرَةٌ,<br>\
(M, K,) which is one of the inf. ns. [or quasiinf. ns.] of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ, like عَافِيَةٌ and عَاقِبَةٌ,<br>\
(M,) He commanded him; ordered him; bade<br>\
him; enjoined him; the inf. n. signifying the<br>\
contr. of نَهْىٌ; (T, M, K;) as also ↓ آمرهُ, (Kr,<br>\
M, K,) mentioned by A&#39;Obeyd also as a dial.<br>\
var. of أمَرَهُ: (Msb:) but A&#39;Obeyd says that<br>\
آمَرْتُهُ and أَمرْتُهُ are syn. [in a sense different from<br>\
that explained above, i. e.] as meaning كَثَّرْتُهُ.<br>\
(TA.) You say, أَمَرَهُ بِهِ, (S, M, K,) and أَمَرَهُ إِيَّاهُ,<br>\
suppressing the prep., (M,) He commanded,<br>\
ordered, bade, or enjoined, him to do it. (M, K.)<br>\
And أمَرْتُكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ, and لِتَفْعَلَ, and بِأنْ تَفْعَلَ,<br>\
I commanded, ordered, bade, or enjoined, thee to<br>\
do [such a thing]. (M.) [And أَمَرَهُ بِكَذَا as<br>\
meaning He commanded him, or ordered him, to<br>\
make use of such a thing; or the like: whence,<br>\
in a trad.,] أُمِرْتُ بِالسِّوَاكِ [I have been commanded<br>\
to make use of the tooth-stick]. (El-Jámi&#39; es-<br>\
Sagheer.) [And He enjoined him such a thing;<br>\
as, for instance, patience.] The imperative of<br>\
أَمَرَ is مُرْ; originally اؤْمُرْ; which also occurs<br>\
[with وَ in the place of ؤ when the ا is pronounced<br>\
with damm]: (M:) but [generally] when it is<br>\
not preceded by a conjunction, (Msb,) i. e., by<br>\
وَ or فَ, (T,) you suppress the ء, [i. e. the radical<br>\
ء, and with it the conjunctive ا preceding it,]<br>\
contr. to rule, and say, مُرْهُ بِكَذَا [Command, or<br>\
order, or bid, or enjoin, thou him to do such a<br>\
thing]; like as you say, كُلْ and خُذْ: when,<br>\
however, it is preceded by a conjunction, the<br>\
practice commonly obtaining is, to restore the وَأْمُرْ بِكَذَا,<br>\
agreeably with analogy, and thus to say, أَمُرْ بِكَذَا.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [You say also, أَمَرَ بِهِ فَقُتِلَ He gave<br>\
an order respecting him, and accordingly he was<br>\
slain. And أَمَرَ لَهُ بِكَذَا He ordered that such a<br>\
thing should be done, or given, to him.] ―<br>\
-b3-  In the<br>\
Kur [xvii. 17], أَمَرْنَا مُتْرَفِيهَا فَفَسَقُوا فِيهَا, so accord.<br>\
to most of the readers, (T, &amp;c.,) means We commanded [its luxurious inhabitants] to obey, but<br>\
they transgressed therein, or departed from the<br>\
right way, or disobeyed: (Fr, T, S, &amp;c.:) so says<br>\
Aboo-Is-hák; adding that, although one says,<br>\
أَمَرتُ زَيْدًا فَضَرَبَ عَمْرًا, meaning I commanded<br>\
Zeyd to beat &#39;Amr, and he beat him, yet one also<br>\
says, أَمَرْتُكَ فَعَصَيْتَنِى [I commanded thee, but thou<br>\
disobeyedst me]: or, accord. to some, the meaning<br>\
is, We multiplied its luxurious inhabitants; (T;)<br>\
and this is agreeable with another reading, namely,<br>\
↓ آمَرْنَا; (TA;) and a reading of El-Hasan, namely,<br>\
أَمِرْنَا, like عَلِمْنَا, may be a dial. var., of the same<br>\
signification: (M:) see 4, in two places: or it<br>\
may be from الإِمَارَةُ; (S, TA;) [in which case it<br>\
seems that we should read ↓ أَمَّرْنَا; or, perhaps,<br>\
أَمَرْنَا: see 2:] Abu-l-&#39;Áliyeh reads ↓ أَمَّرْنَا, and<br>\
this is agreeable with the explanation of I&#39;Ab,<br>\
who says that the meaning is, We made its chiefs<br>\
to have authority, power, or dominion. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  أَمَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
اَمُرَ, also signifies He commanded,<br>\
ordered, bade, or enjoined, him to do that which<br>\
it behooved him to do. (A.) [He counselled, or<br>\
advised, him.] One says, مُرْنِى, meaning Counsel<br>\
thou me; advise thou me. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  أَمَرَ بِاقْتِنَاصٍ, said<br>\
of a wild animal, means He rendered the beholder<br>\
desirous of capturing him. (M.)<br>\

أَمُرَ, aor.<br>\
اَمُرَ; (S, M, IKtt, K;) and أَمِرَ, aor.<br>\
اَمَرَ; (M,<br>\
K, and several other authorities; but by some<br>\
this is disallowed; TA;) inf. n. أَمْرٌ (K) and إِمْرَةٌ<br>\
(S) and إِمَارَةٌ; (As, T, S;) or the second is a<br>\
simple subst.; (K;) or perhaps it is meant in the<br>\
S that this and the third are quasi-inf. ns.; (MF;)<br>\
He had, or held, command; he presided as a<br>\
commander, governor, lord, prince, or king; (M,<br>\
Msb, K;) he became an أَمِير; (As, T, S;) عَلَى<br>\
القَوْمِ over the people. (M, * Msb, K.) [See also 5.]<br>\
أَمَرَ فُلَانٌ وَأُمِرَ عَلَيْهِ, or عليه ↓ وأُمِّرَ, (as in different<br>\
copies of the S,) [Such a one has held command<br>\
and been commanded,] is said of one who has<br>\
been a commander, or governor, after having been<br>\
a subject of a commander, or governor; meaning<br>\
such a one is a person of experience; or one who<br>\
has been tried, or proved and strengthened, by<br>\
experience. (S.)<br>\
-A3-  أَمَرَهُ as syn. with آمَرَهُ: see 4.<br>\
-A4-  أَمِرَ, (S, M, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
اَمَرَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
أَمَرٌ and أَمْرَة; (M, K, TA; the latter written<br>\
in the CK اَمْرَة;) and أمُرَ, aor.<br>\
اَمَرَ; (IKtt;) (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
(a thing, M, Msb, or a man&#39;s property, or camels<br>\
or the like, Abu-l-Hasan and S, and a people, T,<br>\
S) multiplied; or became many, or much, or<br>\
abundant; (T, S, M, Msb, K;) and became complete. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And the former, (assumed tropical:)  His beasts<br>\

↓ آمر; for you say,] بَنُو فُلَانٍ ↓ آمر, inf. n. إِيمَارٌ,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The property, or camels or the like, of the sons<br>\
of such a one multiplied; or became many, or<br>\

اَمَرَ,<br>\
inf. n. أَمَرٌ, (Akh, S,) (assumed tropical:)  The affair, or case, (i. e.,<br>\
a man&#39;s affair, or case, Akh, S,) became severe,<br>\
distressful, grievous, or afflictive. (Akh, S, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
أمّرهُ, inf. n. تَأْمِيرٌ, He made him, or appointed him, commander, governor, lord, prince,<br>\
or king. (S, * Mgh, Msb.) [And it seems to be<br>\
indicated in the S that ↓ أَمَرَهُ, without teshdeed,<br>\
signifies the same.] See 1, in three places. You<br>\
say also, أُمِّرَعَلَيْنَا (A, TA) He was made, or<br>\
appointed, commander, &amp;c., over us. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also He appointed him judge, or umpire. (Mgh.)<br>\

(S, K,) He consulted him respecting his affair,<br>\

inf. n. اسْتِئْمَارٌ; (S, K;) and ↓ ائتمرهُ, (T,) inf. n.<br>\

another trad., آمَرَتْ نَفْسَهَا, meaning She consulted herself, or her mind; as also ↓ استأمرت<br>\

aor.<br>\
اَمُرَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. أَمْرٌ; (Msb;) both signifying the same accord. to AO, (S,) or A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
(TA,) but the latter is of weak authority, (K,) or<br>\
is not allowable; (M;) and, accord. to El-Hasan&#39;s<br>\
reading of xvii. 17 of the Kur, (see 1,) ↓ أَمِرَهُ<br>\

abundant, his progeny, and his beasts: (M, K:)<br>\
and آمر مَالَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He (God) multiplied, &amp;c., his<br>\
property, or camels or the like. (S.)<br>\

تأمّر He became made, or appointed, commander, governor, lord, prince, or king; (Msb;)<br>\
he received authority, power, or dominion; عَلَيْهِمْ<br>\

6<br>\
تَاَاْمَرَ see 8, in three places.<br>\
8<br>\
ائتمر [written with the disjunctive alif اِيتَمَرَ]<br>\
He obeyed, or conformed to, a command; (S, *<br>\
M, Mgh, K; *) he heard and obeyed. (Msb.)<br>\
You say, ائتمر بِخَيْرٍ, meaning He was as though<br>\
his mind commanded him to do good and he<br>\
obeyed the command. (M.) And [you use it<br>\
transitively, saying,] ائتمر الأَمْرَ He obeyed, or<br>\
conformed to, the command. (S.) And لَا يَأْتَمِرُ<br>\
رُشْدًا He will not do right of his own accord.<br>\
(A.) Imra el-Keys says, (S,) or En-Nemir Ibn-Towlab, (T,)<br>\
وَيَعْدُو عَلَى المَرْءِ مَا يَأْتَمِرْ<br>\
[And that which man obeys wrongs him, or injures<br>\
him]; meaning, that which his own soul commands him to do, and which he judges to be<br>\
right, but in which often is found his destruction:<br>\
(S:) or, accord. to Kt, that evil which man purposes to do: (T:) or that which man does without<br>\
consideration, and without looking to its result.<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, T.) [See what follows.] ―<br>\
-b2-  He undertook a thing without consulting; (Kt, T;) as<br>\
though his soul, or mind, ordered him to do it<br>\
and he obeyed it: (TA:) he followed his own<br>\
opinion only. (Mgh.) One says, أَمَرْتُهُ فأْتَمَرَ وَأَبَى<br>\
أَنْ يَأْتَمِرَ, (A, Mgh,) meaning I commanded him,<br>\
but he followed his own opinion only, and refused<br>\
to obey. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He formed an opinion, and<br>\
consulted his own mind, and determined upon it.<br>\
(Sh, T.) And ائتمر رَأْيَهُ He consulted his own<br>\
mind, or judgment, respecting what was right for<br>\
him to do. (Sh, T.) ―<br>\

the measure تَفَاعُلٌ; (S;) and ↓ تأمّروا, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
تَأَمُّرٌ; (K;) They consulted together: (S, * A,<br>\
Msb, K: *) or ائتمروا and ↓ تآمروا signify they<br>\
commanded, ordered, bade, or enjoined, one another; like as one says, اقتتلوا and تقاتلوا, and<br>\
اختصموا and تخاصموا: (T:) or ائتمروا عَلَى الأَمْرِ<br>\
and عَلَيْهِ ↓ تآمروا, they determined, or settled,<br>\
their opinions respecting the affair, or case:<br>\
(M:) and ائتمروا بِهِ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(K,) signifies they purposed it, (S, Msb, K, *)<br>\
namely, a thing, (Msb, K,) and consulted one<br>\
another respecting it. (S.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[lxv. 6], وَأْتَمِرُوا بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ And command ye,<br>\
or enjoin ye, one another to do good: [such is<br>\
app. the meaning,] but God best knoweth: (T:)<br>\
or, accord. to Kt, purpose ye among yourselves to<br>\
do good. (TA.) And in the same [xxviii. 19],<br>\
إِنَّ الْمَلَأَ يَأْتَمِرُونَ بِكَ لِيَقْتُلوُكَ, meaning Verily the<br>\
chiefs command one another respecting thee, to<br>\
slay thee: (Zj, T:) or consult together against<br>\
thee, to slay thee: (AO, T:) or purpose against<br>\
thee, to slay thee: (Kt, T:) but the last but<br>\
one of these explanations is better than the last.<br>\
(T.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also 3. ―<br>\
-b6-  Accord. to El-Bushtee,<br>\
ائتمرهُ also signifies He gave him permission: but<br>\
this has not been heard from an Arab. (Az, TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَاْمَرَ see 3, in two places.<br>\
أَمْرٌ A command; an order; a bidding; an<br>\
injunction; a decree; an ordinance; a prescript:<br>\
(S, * Msb, * TA, &amp;c.:) pl. أَوَامِرُ: (S, Msb, &amp;c.:)<br>\
so accord. to common usage; and some writers<br>\
of authority justify and explain it by saying that<br>\
أَمْرٌ is [originally] مَأْمُوُرٌ بِهِ; that it is then changed<br>\
to the measure فَاعِلٌ; [i. e., to آمِرٌ;] like أَمْرٌ عَارِفٌ,<br>\
which is originally مَعْرُوفٌ; and عِيشَةٌ راضِيَةٌ, originally مَرْضِيَّةٌ; &amp;c.; [and then, to أَمْرٌ;] and that<br>\
فَاعِلٌ becomes in the pl. فَوَاعِلُ; so that أَوَامَرُ is<br>\
the pl. of مَإْمُورٌ: others say that it has this form<br>\
of pl. to distinguish it from أَمْرٌ in the sense of<br>\
حَالٌ [&amp;c.], in which sense it has for its pl. أُمُورٌ.<br>\
(Msb, TA.) [But I think that أَوَامِرُ may be<br>\
properly and originally pl. of آمِرَةٌ, for آيَةٌ آمِرَةٌ, or<br>\
the like. MF says that, accord. to the T and M,<br>\
the pl. of أَمْرٌ in the sense explained in the beginning of this paragraph is أُمُورٌ: but he seems to<br>\
have founded his assertion upon corrupted copies<br>\
of those works; for in the M, I find nothing on<br>\
this point; and in the T, not, as he says, الأَمْرُضِدُّ<br>\
النَّهْىَ وَاحِدُ الأُمُور, but قَالَ اللَّيْثُ الأَمْرُ مَعْرُوفٌ<br>\
نَقِيضُ النَّهْىِ وَاحِدُ الأُمُورِ, evidently meaning<br>\
that أَمْرٌ signifies the contr. of نَهْىٌ, and is also, in<br>\
another sense, the sing. of أُمُورٌ.] [Hence,] أُولُو<br>\
الأَمْرِ Those who hold command or rule, and the<br>\
learned men. (M, K. [See Kur iv. 62.]) And<br>\
أَمْرُاللّٰهِ The threatened punishment of God: so<br>\
in the Kur x. 25, and xi. 42, and xvi.1; in which<br>\
last place occur the words, أَتَي أَمْرُ اللّٰهِ فَلَا تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُ,<br>\
meaning The threatened punishment ordained of<br>\
God hath, as it were, come: so near is it, that it<br>\
is as though it had already come: therefore desire<br>\
not ye to hasten it. (Zj, M, TA.) And The purpose of God. (Bd and Jel in lxv. 3; &amp;c.) And<br>\
الأَمْرُ قَرِيبٌ The resurrection, or the time thereof,<br>\
is near. (Mgh, from a trad.) And مَا فَعَلْتُهُ عَنْ<br>\
أَمْرِى, in the Kur xviii. 81, I did it not of my<br>\
own judgment: (Bd:) or, of my own choice.<br>\
(Jel.) [Hence also الأَمْرُ, in grammar, signifies<br>\
The imperative form of a verb.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A thing;<br>\
an affair; a business; a matter; a concern: a<br>\
state, of a person or thing, or of persons or things<br>\
or affairs or circumstances; a condition; a case:<br>\
an accident; an event: an action: syn. شَأْنٌ:<br>\
(M, F, TA:) and حَالٌ, (Msb, TA,) and حَالَةٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) and حَادِثَةٌ: (K:) and فِعْلٌ: (MF, TA:)<br>\
and a thing that is said; a saying: (TA voce<br>\
أُولُو, at the end of art. ال:) pl. أُمُورٌ; (S, M, K,<br>\
&amp;c.;) its only pl. in the senses here explained.<br>\
(TA.) You say, أَمْرُ فُلَانٍ مُسْتَقِيمٌ [The affair,<br>\
or the like, of such a one is in a right state]: and<br>\
امُورُهُ مُسْتَقِيمَةٌ [His affairs are in a right state].<br>\
(S, A.) And شَتَّتَ أَمْرَهُ He dissipated, disorganized, disordered, unsettled, or broke up, his state<br>\
of things, or affairs. (As, TA in art. شعب.)<br>\
[امر seems to be here used, as in many other<br>\
instances, rather in the sense of the pl. than in that<br>\
of the sing.] ―<br>\
-b3-  أَمْرٌ كُلِّىٌّ [A universal, or general,<br>\
prescript, rule, or canon]. (Msb voce قَاعِدَةٌ, KT<br>\
voce قَانُونٌ, &amp;c.)<br>\
إِمْرٌ a subst. from أَمِرَالِأَمْرُ in the sense of اِشْتَدَّ;<br>\
(S;) or a subst. from أَمِرَ as signifying كَثُرَ and<br>\
تَمَّ; (M;) (assumed tropical:)  [A severe, a distressful, a grievous,<br>\
or an afflictive, thing: or] a terrible, and foul,<br>\
or very foul, thing: or a wonderful thing. (TA,)<br>\
Hence, [used as an epithet, like أَمِرٌ, q. v.,] in the<br>\
Kur [xviii. 70], لَقَدْ جِئْتَ شَيْئًا إِمْرًا (assumed tropical:)  Verily thou<br>\
hast done a severe, a distressful, a grievous, or<br>\
an afflictive, thing: (S:) or a terrible, and foul,<br>\
or very foul, thing: (TA:) or a wonderful<br>\
thing: (S:) or an abominable, a foul, or an<br>\
evil, and a wonderful, thing: (Ks, M, K: *) or<br>\
a terrible and an abominable thing; signifying<br>\
more than نَكْرًا, [which occurs after, in verse 73,]<br>\
inasmuch as the [presumed] drowning of the persons in the ship was more abominable than the<br>\
slaying of one person: (Zj, T:) or a crafty,<br>\
and an abominable, or a foul, or an evil, and a<br>\
wonderful, thing; and derived from أَمِرَ القَوْمُ as<br>\
meaning كَثُرُوا. (Ks.)<br>\
أَمَرٌ a coll. gen. n. of which أَمَرَةٌ (q. v.) is the<br>\
n. un.<br>\
-A2-  See also تَأْمُورٌ.<br>\
أَمِرٌ: see إِمَّرٌ.<br>\
-A2-  (assumed tropical:)  Multiplied; or become many,<br>\
or much, or abundant. (M, K.) [See أَمِرَ.] You<br>\
say زَرْعٌ أَمِرٌ (assumed tropical:)  Abundant seed-produce. (Lh, M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A man whose beasts have multiplied, or<br>\
become many or abundant. (M.) (assumed tropical:)  A man blessed,<br>\
or prospered, (Ibn-Buzurj, M, K, *) in his property: (M:) fem. with ة. (Ibn-Buzurj.) And<br>\
with ة, (assumed tropical:)  A woman blessed to her husband [by her<br>\
being prolific]: from the signification of كَثْرَةٌ.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
-A3-  (assumed tropical:)  Severe; distressful; afflictive. (TA.)<br>\
[See also إِمْرٌ.]<br>\
أَمْرَةٌ A single command, order, bidding, or injunction: as in the saying, لَكَ عَلَىَّ أَمْرَةٌ مُطَاعَةٌ<br>\
Thou hast authority to give me one command,<br>\
order, bidding, or injunction, which shall be<br>\
obeyed by me. (S, M, * A, Msb, K.) You should<br>\
not say, [in this sense,] إِمْرَةٌ, with kesr. (T, S.)<br>\
-A2-  See also إِمْرَةٌ.<br>\
إِمْرَةٌ a subst. from أَمَرَ [q. v.]; Possession of<br>\
command; the office, and authority, of a commander, governor, lord, prince, or king; (M, *<br>\
Msb, K;) as also ↓ إِمَارَةٌ (Mgh, Msb, K) and<br>\
↓ أَمَارَةٌ; (L, K;) but this last is by some disallowed, and is said in the Fs and its Expositions<br>\
to be unknown. (MF.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
لَعَلَّكَ سآءَ تْكَ إِمْرَةُ ابْنِ عَمِّكَ Perhaps thy paternal<br>\
uncle&#39;s son&#39;s possession of command hath displeased thee. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence, (assumed tropical:)  Increase,<br>\
or abundance, or the like; as also other forms<br>\
mentioned in what follows.] You say, فِى وَجْهِ<br>\
مَالِكَ تَعْرِفُ إِمْرَتَهُ (assumed tropical:) In the face of thy property,<br>\
[meaning such as consists in camels or the like,<br>\
and also money,] thou knowest its increase and<br>\
abundance, and its expense: (S:) or ↓ إِمَّرَتَهُ, and<br>\
↓ إِمّرَتَهُ, which latter is a dial. var. of weak<br>\
authority, and ↓ أَمَّرَتَهُ, i. e., its increase and abundance: (M:) or ↓ إِمَّرَتَهُ as meaning its prosperous<br>\
state; as also ↓ أَمَارَتَهُ, and ↓ أَمْرَتَهُ: (Ibn-Buzurj:)<br>\
accord. to AHeyth, who reads ↓ تُعْرَفُ إِمَّرَتُهُ, the<br>\
meaning is, its decrease; but the correct meaning<br>\
is, its increase, as Fr explains it. (T, TA.) It is<br>\
said respecting anything of which one knows what<br>\
is good in it at first sight: (Lh, M:) and means,<br>\
on a thing&#39;s presenting itself, thou knowest its<br>\
