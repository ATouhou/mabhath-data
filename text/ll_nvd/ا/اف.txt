أَفَّ, aor. يَؤُفٌّ (IDrd, M, Mgh, K,) and يَئِفُّ,<br>\
(IDrd, M, K,) the latter agreeable with analogy,<br>\
(TA,) [but the former, though irregular, is the<br>\
more common,] inf. n. أَفٌّ; (M, Mgh;) and<br>\
↓ أفّف, inf. n. تأْفِيفٌ; (S, Mgh, K;) and ↓ تأفّف;<br>\
(M, K;) He said أُفِّ [q. v.], (IDrd, S, M, Mgh,<br>\
K,) by reason of anxiety, or disquietude of mind,<br>\
or by reason of vexation, distress of mind, or<br>\
disgust: (IDrd, M, K:) held by Sb to be of the<br>\
same class as سَبَّحَ and هَلَّلَ meaning “ he said<br>\
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ ” and “ he said لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ. ” (M.) You<br>\
say also, ↓ أَفَّفَهُ, and بِهِ ↓ أَفَّفَ, and بِهِ ↓ تَأَفَّفَ,<br>\
meaning He said to him أُفِّ. (M.) And جَعَلَ<br>\
مِنْ رِيحٍ وَجَدَهَا ↓ فُلَانٌ يَتَأَفَّفُ Such a one began to<br>\
say أُفِّ أُفِّ by reason of a smell which he perceived.<br>\
(T.) And عَلَيْهِ ↓ إِنَّهُ يَتَأَفَّفُ Verily he is angry<br>\
with him, or enraged against him. (TA.)<br>\

أُفٌّ Dirt, or filth; as also ↓ أُفَّةٌ: (S:) you say,<br>\
أُفَّا لَهُ, and ↓ أُفَّةً, Dirt, or filth, to him; in which<br>\
the tenween is for the purpose of rendering them<br>\
indeterminate; (S;) and أُفَّ لَهُ وَ تُفٌّ; (T;) and<br>\
وَتُفَّةً ↓ أُفَّةً; and أُفَّا وَتُفَّا; (T, S;) the latter of<br>\
which is an imitative sequent: (S:) or أُفٌّ signifies the dirt of the ear; and تُفٌّ, the dirt of the<br>\
nails; (As, T, M, K; but in the last, of the nail;)<br>\
the phrases mentioned above being used on the<br>\
occasion of deeming a thing dirty or filthy, and<br>\
afterwards on the occasion of experiencing annoyance or disgust at anything; (As, T, M,* TA;)<br>\
and ↓ أَفَفٌ, also, has the former of these two<br>\
meanings: (TA:) or أُفٌّ signifies the dirt around<br>\
the nail; (M;) or the dirt of the nail; (K;) and<br>\
تُفٌّ, the dirt in the nail: (M:) or the former, a<br>\
paring of the nail: and a piece of stick, or a<br>\
reed, which one takes up from the ground: (K:)<br>\
in these various senses they are explained as used<br>\
in the saying, أُفَّا لَهُ وَتُفَّا: (TA:) or the former<br>\
signifies stink: (Zj, TA:) or paucity; (T, M,<br>\
K) as also ↓ أَفَفٌ; (M;) or from ↓ أَفَفٌ signifying a thing little in quantity; (T; and the<br>\
same meaning is assigned to this word in the K;)<br>\
and تُفٌّ is an imitative sequent, (T, M, K,) of<br>\
the same meaning. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أُفّ, also, is a word<br>\
expressive of vexation, distress of mind, or disgust;<br>\
(M, Mgh;) or of dislike, displeasure, or hatred;<br>\
(K;) and has six forms; (T, S;) mentioned by<br>\
Akh; (S;) or ten; (M;) or forty; (K;) or<br>\
more; (TA;) as follow: أُفِّ and أُفَّ and أُفُّ and<br>\
أُفٍّ and أُفَّا and أُفٌّ (T, S, M, K) and أُفِّ and أُفَ<br>\
and أُفُ and أُفٍ and أُفًا and أُفٌ (K) and أُفْ (M,<br>\
K) and أُفّْ and ↓ أُفَّى, pronounced with imáleh,<br>\
(M, K,) i. e. with pure imáleh, and ↓ أُفَّى with<br>\
intermediate imáleh, and ↓ أُفَّى without imáleh,<br>\
the alif [written ى] in these three denoting the<br>\
fem. gender, and ↓ أُفِّى, with kesr to the ف, (K,)<br>\
i. e., as a prefixed noun with its complement, [the<br>\
latter being the pronoun of the first pers.,] (TA,)<br>\
and ↓ أُفُّوْهْ, (K,) with damm to the أ and ف,<br>\
which latter is with teshdeed, and with the و and<br>\
ه quiescent, (TA,) and ↓ أُفَّةْ [in a copy of the M<br>\
↓ أُفَّةً] and ↓ أُفِهْ and ↓ أُفُّهْ (K) and ↓ إِفْ and ↓ إِفّْ<br>\
and ↓ إِفِ and ↓ إِفٍ and ↓ إِفًا and ↓ إِفٌ and ↓ إِفٍّ<br>\
and ↓ إِفًّ and ↓ إِفٌّ and ↓ إِفُّ, with damm to the<br>\
ف, which is with teshdeed, [in a copy of the M<br>\
↓ إِفَّ,] and ↓ إِفَّا, like إِنَّا, and ↓ إِفَّى, pronounced<br>\
with imáleh, and ↓ إِفِّى, with kesr, (K,) i. e.,<br>\
prefixed to the pronoun of the first person,<br>\
(IAmb,) and ↓ أَفْ and ↓ أَفِّ (K) and ↓ أَفٍّ or<br>\
↓ أَفٍ and ↓ آفِ, or ↓ آفِّ, and ↓ آفٍ, or ↓ آفٍّ,<br>\
(accord. to different copies of the K,) [all these<br>\
forms, making the number (forty) mentioned by<br>\
the author of the K, I have drawn from a comparison of three copies of that work, and I believe<br>\
them to be correct: some other forms are mentioned by SM as perhaps indicated in the K; but<br>\
I see no good reason for this: he then adds,] and<br>\
↓ أَفَهْ and ↓ أَفُوهْ and ↓ أَفَّهْ, the last mentioned by<br>\
IB on the authority of IKtt. (TA.) أُفِّ, [with<br>\
its variants,] in its primary sense, denotes one&#39;s<br>\
blowing at a thing that falls upon him, such as<br>\
dust or ashes; or at the place, to remove therefrom what is annoying; therefore people say, at<br>\
anything that they deem troublesome, or displeasing, or hateful, أُفِّ لَهُ [as though meaning<br>\
A puff, or blast of breath, to it]: (Kt, T:) or<br>\
[rather] it is a word imitative of a sound; [like<br>\
ugh in English, both in sound and meaning; and<br>\
in meaning like our interjections foh and faugh;]<br>\
(Bd on the ex. in the Kur which will be found<br>\
below, and TA;) denoting vexation, or distress<br>\
of mind, or disgust; (Bd ubi suprà) or denoting<br>\
contempt: (TA:) or it is a verbal noun, meaning<br>\
I am vexed, or distressed in mind, or disgusted:<br>\
(Bd ubi suprà:) or it is an imperative verbal<br>\
noun [denoting disgust or abhorrence, like out,<br>\
and away]: (IJ, M:) or he who says أُفَّا لَكَ uses<br>\
it in the manner of an imprecation, like as one<br>\
says وَيْلًا لِلْكَافِرِينَ; and he who says أُفٌّ لَكَ puts<br>\
it in the nom. case because of the ل, like as one<br>\
says وَيْلٌ لِلْكَافِرِينَ; and he who says أُفٍّ لَكَ puts<br>\
it in the gen. case likening it to words imitative<br>\
of sounds. (IAmb.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[xvii. 24], وَلَا تَقُلْ لَهُمَا أُفِّ, (T, S, TA,) or أُفٍّ,<br>\
(TA, [in which other readings also are mentioned,]) [And say not thou to them (i. e. to thy<br>\
father and mother) Ugh, &amp;c.,] meaning, do not<br>\
thou deem anything of their affairs burdensome,<br>\
nor be contracted in bosom thereby, nor be rough,<br>\
or harsh, or coarse, to them: (Kt, T:) or do not<br>\
thou say to them anything expressive of the least<br>\
disgust, when they have become old, but take<br>\
upon thyself their service; أُفِّ signifying stink.<br>\
