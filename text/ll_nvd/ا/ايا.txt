load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'اياأَيَا a vocative particle, (S, M, K,) used in calling<br>\
him who is near and him who is distant: [in the<br>\
former case, like O: in the latter, like ho there,<br>\
or soho, or holla:] you say, أَيَا زَيْدُ أَقْبِلْ [O Zeyd,<br>\
advance: or ho there, or soho, or holla, &amp;c.]:<br>\
(S:) or J is in error in saying this: it is used in<br>\
calling to him who is distant: (Mughnee, K:)<br>\
so say Ibn-El-Hájib, in the Káfiyeh, and ElFakhr El-Járabardee; and the latter adds, or<br>\
to him who is in a predicament like that of him<br>\
who is distant, being sleeping or inadvertent; the<br>\
person who calls thereby being eager for the<br>\
person called to advance to him: (TA:) or not<br>\
used in calling to him who is near: (K:) and ه<br>\
is substituted for its hemzeh; (M, K;) so that<br>\
one says, هَيَا. (M.) AZ says, I have heard them<br>\
say, أَيَا إِيَاهُ أَقْبِلْ. (T in بَابُ الأَلِفَاتِ.) [Accord.<br>\
to the TA, (art. ا,) one says also آيَا.]<br>\
إِيَا الشَّمْسِ, and النَّبَاتِ; and إِيَاة, and أَيَاة, and<br>\
أَيَّا: see art. اى.<br>\
إِيَّا (S, M, K, &amp;c.) and أَيَّا, (M, K,) the latter<br>\
form used by some, as related on the authority<br>\
of Ktr; (M;) accord. to some, (M,) a noun of<br>\
vague signification, (S, M, K,) used metonymically for a noun in the accus. case, (M,) with<br>\
which are connected all the affixed pronouns that<br>\
denote the accus. case: you say إِيَّانا [Thee] and<br>\
إِيَّاهُ [him] and إِيَّاىَ [me] (S, K) and إِيَّانَا [us,<br>\
&amp;c.]: (S:) and the hemzeh is changed into و, so<br>\
that you say وِيَّاكَ (S, M, K *) and وَيَّاكَ; (Ktr,<br>\
IJ, M, K; *) and sometimes into و, so that you<br>\
say وِيَّاكَ [and app. وَيَّاكَ also; both of which<br>\
are used by some of the Arabs in the present day,<br>\
very commonly in Egypt, for وَإِيَّاكَ as meaning<br>\
مَعَكَ; like as one says وَزَيْدًا, meaning مَعَ زَيْدٍ]:<br>\
(K:) the ك and ه and ى [&amp;c.] are put to show<br>\
the object meant, in order that the person addressed may be known from the absent [&amp;c.]; and<br>\
have no place in the analysis of a sentence, like<br>\
the ك in ذٰلِكَ and أَرَأَيْتَكَ: (S, M: in the former<br>\
of which is added, and like the ا and ن in أَنْتَ:)<br>\
and this is identical with the opinion of Akh:<br>\
(M, TA:) thus ايّا is the noun, and what follows it<br>\
is to denote allocution, [&amp;c.,] and the two become<br>\
as one thing; for nouns of vague signification<br>\
are not prefixed to other nouns to govern them<br>\
in the gen. case, nor are any of the pronouns, being<br>\
themselves determinate. (S.) Ibn-Keysán says,<br>\
(S, M,) some of the grammarians say that إِيَّاكَ,<br>\
altogether, is a noun; and he adds, but some say<br>\
(M) that the ك and ه &amp;c. are the nouns, and that<br>\
ايّا is a support thereto, because they cannot stand<br>\
by themselves, (S, M,) like the ك &amp;c. which<br>\
occupy the latter place in يَضْرِبُكَ &amp;c.; so when<br>\
the ك &amp;c. are put first, [as in إِيَّاكَ ضَرَبْتُ Thee I<br>\
beat, or struck,] they are supported by ايا, and<br>\
the whole becomes as one thing: (S:) and you<br>\
may also say, ضَرَبْتُ إِيَّاىَ [I beat, or struck,<br>\
me]; because it is not allowable to say, ضَرَبْتُنِى:<br>\
(S as corrected by IB:) but you may not say,<br>\
ضَرَبْتُ إِيَّاكَ [I beat, or struck, thee]; because<br>\
you only require ايّاك when you cannot use the<br>\
ك [alone]; though you may say, ضَرَبْتُكَ إِيّاكَ [I<br>\
beat, or struck, thee, thee]; because the ك is made<br>\
to be syntactically dependent upon the verb, so<br>\
when you repeat it you require ايّا. (S.) In the<br>\
saying of the poet, (S,) Dhu-l-Isba&#39; El-&#39;Adwánee,<br>\
(TA,)<br>\
كَأَنَّايَوْمَ قُرَّى إِنَّمَا نَقْتُلُ إِيَّانَا<br>\
[As though we, on the day of Kurrà, only killed<br>\
ourselves], he has separated it from the verb only<br>\
because the Arabs do not make the action of the<br>\
agent to fall upon the agent itself by the adjunction of the pronoun: they do not say, قَتَلْتُنِى,<br>\
but only قَتَلْتُ نَفْسِى: so the poet has used<br>\
ايّانا in the same manner as أَنْفُسَنَا. (S, TA.)<br>\
Some of the grammarians say that إِيَّا is prefixed<br>\
to what follows it, governing it in the gen. case;<br>\
and adduce as an evidence thereof a saying which<br>\
see below, commencing with إِذَا بَلَغَ الرَّجُلُ. (S.)<br>\
Zj says that it is an explicit noun, [not a pronoun,]<br>\
which is prefixed to all the pronouns, governing<br>\
them in the gen. case; but only to pronouns;<br>\
so that if one said, إِيَّا زَيْدٍ حَدَّثْتُ, it would be<br>\
bad. (M.) Kh holds that it is a pronoun prefixed to the ك [&amp;c.], governing it in the gen.<br>\
case; (M, K;) and the like is related to have<br>\
been the opinion of El-Mázinee: and Sb relates<br>\
of Kh that he said, if any one were to say إِيَّاكَ<br>\
نَفْسَكَ [Thee, thyself], I would not severely<br>\
blame him, for this ك is [virtually] governed in<br>\
the gen. case. (M.) But accord. to Akh, it is<br>\
a simple, or uncompounded, pronoun, the ending<br>\
of which becomes altered, as the endings of pronouns are wont to become, because of the varying<br>\
of the numbers of the persons using them; (M,<br>\
K; [in both of which the last of the word thus<br>\
rendered is المضمرين; accord. to a copy of the<br>\
M, المضمرين, i. e. المُضْمِرينَ; in a copy of the<br>\
K, without any syll. signs; and in the CK,<br>\
المُضْمَرَيْنِ; of which readings, I have followed<br>\
that found in the M; supposing the meaning to<br>\
be, that ايّا has different endings according as it<br>\
is used by one speaking to another, or by one<br>\
speaking of another, or by one speaking of himself, or to, or of, two or more, and the like;])<br>\
and the ك of ايَّاك is like the ك of ذٰلِكَ, inasmuch<br>\
as it is an indication of allocution only, divested<br>\
of the idea of its being a sign of the pronoun.<br>\
(M.) Of all these varying opinions, IJ says that<br>\
he has found none to be correct when investigated,<br>\
except that of Akh; with whose opinion, that<br>\
stated in the begining of this art. is identical<br>\
[except as to the affix, which is there said to be<br>\
a pronoun, not merely a particle of allocution].<br>\
(M, TA.) Zj, being asked to explain the meaning<br>\
of the phrase إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ, [in the Kur i. 4,] answered, حَقِيتَتَكَ نَعْبُدُ [Thine essence we worship];<br>\
and said that it is derived from آيَةٌ, meaning “a<br>\
sign by which a thing is known:” but IJ does<br>\
not approve of this. (M.) [Respecting the phrase,<br>\
فَإِذَا هُوَ إِيَّاهَا, in which ايّاها is used in the place<br>\
of a noun in the nom. case, and which is therefore disallowed by Sb, see إِذَا.] ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also<br>\
used for the purpose of cautioning, or putting one<br>\
on his guard. (T, S.) You say, إِيَّاكَ وَالأَسَدَ<br>\
[Beware thou of, or avoid thou, or remove thyself<br>\
far from, the lion]: it is a substitute for a verb;<br>\
as thou you said, بَاعِدْ: and you say also, هِيَّاكَ;<br>\
like as you say أَرَاقَ and هَرَاقَ: (S:) [or ايّاك in<br>\
this case is governed by a verb understood: for]<br>\
Ibn-Keysán says, when you say, إِيَّاكَ وَزَيْدًا<br>\
[Beware thou of, or avoid thou, or remove thyself<br>\
far from, Zeyd], you caution him whom you<br>\
address against Zeyd, and the verb governing the<br>\
accus. case is not apparent: the meaning is,<br>\
أُحَذِّرُكَ زَيْدًا [I caution thee against Zeyd]; as<br>\
though you said, أُحَذِّرُكَ إِيَّاكَ وَزَيْدًا [I caution<br>\
thee, thee with Zeyd]; or as though you said,<br>\
بَاعِدْ نَفْسَكَ عَنْ زَيْدٍ وَبَاعِد زَيْدًا عَنْكَ [Remove thyself far from Zeyd, and remove Zeyd far from<br>\
thee]; so that the verb governs the word signifying the person cautioned and that signifying him<br>\
against whom that person is cautioned: (TA:) [and<br>\
Az says,] when you say, إِيَّاكَ وَرُكُوبَ الفَاحِشَةِ, the<br>\
verb is suppressed: it is as though you said,<br>\
أُحَذِّرُكَ رُكُوبَ الفَاحِشَةِ [I caution thee against<br>\
the committing of that which exceeds the bounds<br>\
of rectitude]. (T.) Kh is related to have heard<br>\
an Arab of the desert say, (T, * M, the latter on the<br>\
authority of Sb.,) إِذَابَلَغَ الرَّجُلُ السِّتِّينَ فَإيَّاهُ وَإِيَّا<br>\
الشَّوابّ [When the man attains to sixty years,<br>\
I caution him against, or let him avoid, the<br>\
young women]; (T, S, M;) prefixing ايّا to<br>\
الشوابّ, and putting the latter in the gen. case:<br>\
(S:) but accord. to Akh, it is not allowable to<br>\
say [thus, or] إِيَّاكَ وَإِيَّا زَيْدٍ. (M.) Sometimes<br>\
the و is suppressed, as in the saying of the poet,<br>\
فَإِيَّاكَ إِيَّاكَ المِرَآءَ فَإِنَّهُ<br>\
إِلَى الشَّرِّ دَعَّآءٌ وَلِلشَّرِّ جَالِبُ<br>\
[Then avoid thou, avoid thou obstinate disputation, for it is wont to invite to evil, and an<br>\
attracter of evil]; meaning, إِيَّاكَ وَالمِرَآءَ: i. e.,<br>\
إِيَّاكَ وَأَنْ تُمَارِيَ. (TA.) You say [properly], إِيَّاكَ وَأَنْ<br>\
تَفْعَلَ كَذَا [Beware thou of, or avoid thou, doing<br>\
such a thing]: but [in strict propriety] you should<br>\
not say, إِيَّاكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا, without و. (S.) See<br>\
also art. اي.<br>\
أَيَايَا (Lth, T, S, M, K) and أَيَايَهْ, (M,) or يَايَا,<br>\
(K,) and يَايَهْ, (M, K,) A cry by which camels<br>\
are chidden. (Lth, T, S, M, K.) [See 2 in art.<br>\
اي.]<br>\
