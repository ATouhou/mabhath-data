أَمِهَ, aor.<br>\
اَمَهَ, inf. n. أَمَهٌ, He forgot. (S, K.)<br>\
Hence the reading of I&#39;Ab, [in the Kur xii. 45,]<br>\
وَادَّكَرَ بَعْدَ أَمَهٍ [And he remembered, or became<br>\
reminded, after forgetting]. (S.) AHeyth is said<br>\
to have read بَعْدَ أَمْهٍ; and accord. to AO, أَمْهٌ<br>\
signifies نِسْيَانٌ [like أَمَهٌ]; but this is not correct.<br>\
(Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He confessed, or acknowledged:<br>\
(S, K:) occurring in this sense in a trad. of<br>\
Ez-Zuhree; but not well known. (S.) The reading of I&#39;Ab, mentioned above, بَعْدَ أَمَهٍ, is<br>\
explained by A&#39;Obeyd as meaning after confessing, or acknowledging. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تأمّه أُمَّا He adopted a mother; (M, K;)<br>\
as also تَأَمَّمَهَا. (M in art. ام.)<br>\
أُمَّهَةٌ i. q. أُمٌّ [A mother of a human being and<br>\
of any animal]: (M, K:) the former is [said<br>\
by some to be] the original of the latter: (S:)<br>\
Aboo-Bekr says that the ه in the former is a<br>\
radical letter: (TA:) or the former applies to a<br>\
rational creature; and the latter, to [a rational<br>\
and] an irrational: (K:) or, accord. to Az, the<br>\
pl. of the former applies to the rational; and<br>\
that of the latter, to the irrational: (TA:) the<br>\
former sing. sometimes applies to an irrational<br>\
creature: (IJ, TA:) [for some further remarks<br>\
on both of these words and their pls., see the<br>\
latter of them:] the pl. [of the former] is أُمَّهَاتٌ<br>\
and [that of the latter is] أُمَّاتٌ: (T, S:) Az says<br>\
that the امو is added in the former for the purpose<br>\
of distinguishing between the daughters of Adam<br>\
[to whom it is generally applied] and other animate<br>\
beings. (TA.)<br>\
أَمَتْ<br>\
1<br>\
آمَتْ, (S, * M, K, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
آمَتْ,]) second pers. أَمَوْتِ; (S;) and أَمِيَتْ, (M,<br>\
K,) like سَمِعَتْ; (K;) and أَمُوَتْ, (Lh, M, K,)<br>\
like كَرُمَتٌ; (K;) inf. n. أُمُوَّةٌ; (S, M, K;)<br>\
She (a woman) became a slave; (S, * M, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ تَأَمَّتْ. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  أَمَتِ السِّنَّوْرُ, aor. تَأْمُو,<br>\
inf. n. أُمَآءٌ, The cat [mewed, or] uttered a cry;<br>\
(S, K;) like مَآءَ تْ, aor. تَمُوْءُ, inf. n. مُوَآءٌ. (S.)<br>\
2<br>\
أَمَّاهَا, (M, K,) inf. n. تَأْمِيَةٌ, (K,) He made<br>\
her a slave. (M, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَأَمَّتُ: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  تأمّى أَمَةً He took for himself a female slave; (S, M, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ اِسْتَأْمَاهَا. (S, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
هُوَيَأْتَمِى بِهِ He follows his (another person&#39;s)<br>\
example; imitates him; i. q. يَأْتَمُّ بِهِ (TA in<br>\
the present art.) And ائتمى بِالشَّىْءِ [written with<br>\
the disjunctive alif اِيتَمَى] is used for ائتَمَّ بِهِ<br>\
[He made the thing to be a rule of life or conduct],<br>\
by substitution [of ى for م], (M and K in<br>\
art. ام,) the doubling [of the م] being disapproved. (M in that art.)<br>\

إِسْتَاْ^َََ see 5.<br>\
أَمَةٌ, originally اموة, (Msb,) [but whether أَمَوَةٌ<br>\
or أَمْوَةٌ is disputed, as will be seen in what follows,]<br>\
A female slave; (M, K;) a woman whose condition is that of slavery; (T;) contr. of حُرَّةٌ:<br>\
(S:) [in relation to God, best rendered a handmaid:] dual أَمَتَانِ: (Msb:) pl. آمٍ, (Lth, T, S,<br>\
M, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) like قِاضٍ, (Msb,) a pl. of pauc.<br>\
[respecting which see what follows after the other<br>\
pls.], (Lth, T,) and إِمَآءٌ [the most common form]<br>\
(T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and إِمْوَانٌ (T, S, M,<br>\
Msb, K) and أُمْوَانٌ (K, and so in some copies<br>\
of the M) and أَمْوَانٌ (K, and so in some copies<br>\
of the M) [the last, or last but one, accord. to<br>\
different copies of the M, on the authority of<br>\
Lh,] and أَمَوَاتٌ, (M, Msb, K,) for which one<br>\
may say أَمَاتٌ. (Ibn-Keysán, TA.) Accord. to<br>\
Sb (M) and Mbr (TA) it is originally أَمَوَةٌ, (S,<br>\
M, K,) because it has for a pl. آمٍ, (S, M,) which<br>\
is [originally أَأْمُوٌ,] of the measure أَفْعُلٌ, (Lth,<br>\
T, S,) like آكُمٌ, pl. of أَكَمَةٌ, (Sb, M,) and like<br>\
أَيْنُقٌ, [pl. of نَاقةٌ, which is originally نَوَقةٌ,] for a<br>\
sing. of the measure فَعْلَةٌ has not a pl. of this<br>\
form; (S;) and Mbr says that there is no noun<br>\
of two letters but a letter has been dropped from<br>\
it, which it indicates by its pl. or dual, or by<br>\
a verb if it is derived therefrom: (TA:) or it is<br>\
originally فَعْلَةٌ: (AHeyth, T, K:) AHeyth says<br>\
that they suppressed its final radical letter, and,<br>\
forming a pl. from it after the manner of نَخْلَةٌ<br>\
and نَخْلٌ, instead of saying أَمٌ, which they disliked as being of only two letters, they transposed<br>\
the suppressed و, changing it into ا, and placing<br>\
it between the ا and م. (T: [in which this<br>\
opinion, though it does not account for the termination of the pl. آمٍ, is said to be preferable.])<br>\
One says, جَآءَ تْنِىً أَمَةُ اللّٰهِ [The handmaid of God<br>\
came to me]: and in the dual, جَآءَ تْنِى أمَتَا اللّٰهِ:<br>\
and in the pl., جَآءَ نِى إِمَآءُ اللّٰهِ and إِمْوَانُ اللّٰهِ and<br>\
أَمَوَاتُ اللّٰهِ; and one may also say, أَمَاتُ اللّٰه.<br>\
(Ibn-Keysán, TA.) [ISd says,] وَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ مِنْ كُلِّ<br>\
أَمَةٍ بحَجَرٍ is mentioned by IAar as said in imprecating evil on a man; but I think it is من كلّ<br>\
أَمْتِ [May God cast a stone at him from every<br>\
elevated place, or the like]. (M.)<br>\
أَمَوِىُّ Of, or relating or belonging to, a female<br>\
slave. (S.)<br>\
أُمَيَّةٌ dim. of أَمَةٌ; (S, Msb;) originally أُمَيْوَةٌ.<br>\
