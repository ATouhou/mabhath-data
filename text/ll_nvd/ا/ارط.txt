اَرڤطَ [The unaugmented verb from this root seems<br>\
to be unknown, if it were ever in use, for it is<br>\
not mentioned, though the pass. part. n., مَأْرُوطٌ,<br>\
is mentioned as having three significations, which<br>\
see below.]<br>\

آرَطَتِ الأَرْضُ, (AHeyth, K,) of the measure<br>\
أَفْعَلَت, [originally] with two alifs, (TA,) [aor.<br>\
يُؤْرِطُ, inf. n. إِيرَاطٌ,] The land produced the kind of<br>\
trees called أَرْطًى [or أَرْطَى]; (AHeyth, K;) as<br>\
also أَرْطَت, inf. n. إِرْطَآءٌ; or this is a corruption,<br>\
attributable to J: so says the author of the K,<br>\
following AHeyth: but it is no corruption, for<br>\
it is mentioned by the authors on verbs and by<br>\
ISd and others; (MF, TA;) for instance, by<br>\
AHn, in his book on plants, and by IF, in<br>\
the Mj: (TA:) [and J mentions it in its proper<br>\
place, in art. رطى, as well as in the present art.:]<br>\
↓ أَرَّطَت, with the ر musheddedeh, has also been<br>\
found in the handwriting of certain of the men<br>\
of letters; but this is a corruption. (K.)<br>\
أَرِطٌ A colour like that of the أَرْطًي [or أَرْطَي].<br>\
(Sgh, K.)<br>\
أَرْطًي, (Mbr, S, K,) of the measure فَعْلًى,<br>\
because you say أَدِيمٌ مَأْرُوطٌ, [explained below,]<br>\
(Mbr, S,) the alif (Mbr, S, K) ending it (Mbr)<br>\
[written ى] being a letter of quasi-coordination,<br>\
(S, K,) not to denote the fem. gender, (Mbr, S,)<br>\
its n. un. being أَرْطَاةٌ, (Mbr, S, K,) wherefore<br>\
it is with tenween when indeterminate, but not<br>\
when determinate: (S, K:) or it is of the<br>\
measure أَفْعَلٌ, (Mbr, * S,) the last letter being<br>\
radical, (Mbr,) because you say أَدِيمٌ مَرْطِيُّ,<br>\
(Mbr, S,) and in this case it should be mentioned<br>\
among words with an infirm letter [for the last<br>\
radical], and is with tenween both when determinate and when indeterminate; (S;) [but this<br>\
is a mistake, for when it is determinate, it can<br>\
be with tenween only if used as a proper name;<br>\
therefore,] IB observes, that if you make its<br>\
last letter radical, its measure is أَفْعَل, and a word<br>\
of this measure, if a subst., is imperfectly decl.<br>\
when determinate, but perfectly decl. when indeterminate: (TA:) [the author of the K copies<br>\
the error of the S, saying, “or its alif is radical,”<br>\
(meaning its last letter,) “ and in this case it is<br>\
always with tenween; ” and he adds, “or,” (for<br>\
which he should have said “ and,”) its measure<br>\
is أَفْعَل: to all which it is necessary to add,<br>\
that some of the grammarians hold it to be also<br>\
of the measure فَعْلَى, ending with a fem. alif,<br>\
and therefore assign to it no n. un.:] A kind of<br>\
tree, (S, K,) of those growing in sands, (S, TA,)<br>\
resembling the kind called عِضَاه, growing as a<br>\
branch [in the TA عَصَبًا, for which I read غُضْنًا,]<br>\
from a single stem, to the height of the stature<br>\
of a man, the leaves whereof are what are termed<br>\
هَدَب [q. v., and are included among those termed<br>\
خُوص], (AHn, TA,) and its flower is like that<br>\
of the خِلَاف [or salix ægyptia], (AHn, K,) save<br>\
in being smaller, the colour being one; and the<br>\
odour thereof is pleasant: it grows in sands, and<br>\
therefore the poets make frequent mention of the<br>\
wild bulls&#39; and cows&#39; taking refuge among this<br>\
and other trees of the sands, burrowing at their<br>\
roots to hide themselves there, and to protect<br>\
themselves from the heat and cold and rain, but<br>\
not among the trees in hard ground, for burrowing<br>\
in the sand is easy: (AHn, TA:) its fruit is<br>\
like the عُنَّاب [or jujube], bitter, and is eaten by<br>\
camels in its fresh moist state, and its roots are<br>\
red, (AHn, K,) intensely red: (AHn, TA:)<br>\
AHn adds, a man of the Benoo-Asad informed<br>\
me, that the leaves (هَدَب) of the ارطي are red<br>\
like the red pomegranate: its fruit also is red:<br>\
(TA:) the dual is أَرْطَيَانِ: (AHn, TA:) and the<br>\
pl. أَرْطَيَاتٌ and أَرَاطَيِ and أَرَاطٍ, (AHn, K,) in<br>\
the accus. case أرَاطِي. (TA.)<br>\
أَرْطَوِىٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
أَرْطَاوِىُّ: see what next follows.<br>\
مَأْرُوطٌ A hide tanned with أَرْطًي; (S, K;) i. e.<br>\
with the leaves thereof; (S in art. رطي;) as also<br>\
↓ مُؤَرْطًي; (TA;) and so مَرْطِيٌّ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A<br>\
camel having a complaint from eating أَرْطًي:<br>\
(L, K: *) and a camel that eats أَرْطًي, (AZ, S, K,)<br>\
and keeps to it; (K;) as also ↓ أَرْطَوِىُّ (AZ, S, K)<br>\
and ↓ أَرْطَاوِىٌّ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, Sgh, L, K.)<br>\
مُؤَرْطًي: see what next precedes.<br>\
