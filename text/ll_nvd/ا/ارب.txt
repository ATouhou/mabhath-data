اَرَبَ, inf. n. أَرَبٌ,] S, M,<br>\

assigns the former inf. n. to it when it signifies<br>\

He devoted, or addicted, himself, or clave, or kept,<br>\
to the thing: (T, K:) and he was, or became,<br>\
niggardly, avaricious, or tenacious, of the thing.<br>\

-b5-  And أَرِبَ فِى الأَمْرِ, and فِيهِ ↓ تأرّب,<br>\
He exerted, or employed, his power and ability<br>\
in the affair, and understood it: (ISh, T:) or<br>\
تأرّب signifies he exerted his strength, force, or<br>\
energy; or strained himself; (As, S, M;) فِي الشَّىْءِ<br>\

-b3-  أَرِبَ الدَّهْرُ<br>\
Fortune was, or became, hard, or adverse: (T, S,<br>\

which it pressed hard. (M, TA.) And أَرِبَ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
He was, or became, hard upon him in his demand.<br>\
(TA, from a trad.)<br>\
-A3-  أَرَبَهُ, [from إِرَبٌ,] He struck<br>\
upon a member, or limb, belonging to him. (K, *<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَرِبَ, (T, S, K, TA,) His member, or<br>\
limb, (generally meaning the arm, or hand, M,)<br>\
was cut off: (M, K:) or dropped off: (T:) and<br>\
his members, or limbs, (generally relating to [the<br>\
members, or fingers, of] the arm, or hand, TA,)<br>\
dropped off, one after another, (S, K, TA,) in<br>\
consequence of his being affected by the disease<br>\
termed جُذَام: (TA:) and it (said of a member,<br>\
or limb,) dropped off. (TA.) The phrase, أَرِبْتَ<br>\
عَنْ ذِى يَدَيْكَ, (T, TA,) or مِنْ ذى يديك, (S,<br>\
TA, [and said in the latter to be likewise found<br>\
in the T, but I have consulted two copies of the<br>\
T and found only عن,]) or فِى ذى يديك, (IAar,<br>\
as related by Sh,) or مِنْ يَدَيْكَ, (K,) but MF<br>\
says that من in this phrase is a mistranscription,<br>\
(TA,) means, May the members [or fingers] of<br>\
thy hands, or arms, drop off: (S, K, TA:) or it<br>\
means, may what is in thy hands depart from<br>\
thee, so that thou shalt be in want: occurring in<br>\
a trad. (IAar, T, TA.) And أَرِبَ مَا لَهُ, said by<br>\
Mohammad on the occasion of a man&#39;s coming to<br>\
him and asking him to acquaint him with some<br>\
work that should introduce him into Paradise,<br>\
means, accord. to Kt, May his members, or limbs,<br>\
drop off, or be cut off: what aileth him? (TA:)<br>\
or, accord. to IAar, may he become in want: what<br>\
aileth him? (T, TA:) but IAth says that this<br>\
has been related in three different ways: first,<br>\
أَرِبَ, signifying an imprecation, [as rendered<br>\
above,] and used as expressive of wonder: secondly, مَّا لَهُ ↓ أَرَبٌ; i. e. حَاجَةٌ لَهُ; مَا being<br>\
[syntactically] redundant, denoting littleness; the<br>\
meaning being, he has some little want: or, as<br>\
some say, a want hath brought him: what aileth<br>\
him? thirdly, ↓ أَرِبٌ; i. e. هُوَ أَرِبٌ; meaning he<br>\
is intelligent, or sagacious, or skilful, [as is said in<br>\
the T,] and perfect: what aileth him? or what<br>\
is his affair? the inchoative being suppressed.<br>\
(TA.) مَا لَهُ أَرِبَتْ يَدُهُ, (M, K, *) another form of<br>\
imprecation, (M,) means What aileth him? may<br>\
his arm, or hand, be cut off: or, may he become<br>\
poor, and want what is in the hands of others.<br>\
(M, K. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, perhaps,] أَرِبَتْ مَعِدَتُهُ His<br>\
stomach became vitiated, disordered, or in an<br>\
unsound state. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  أَرِبَ also signifies He<br>\

of the word إِرْبٌ]. (T.)<br>\
2<br>\

rendered, cunning, or intelligent, excellent in judgment, sagacious, and knowing in affairs; (see<br>\
