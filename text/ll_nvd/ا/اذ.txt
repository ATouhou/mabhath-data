load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'اذإِذْ a word denoting past time: (Lth, T, S, M,<br>\
L, Mughnee, K:) it is a noun, (S, L, Mughnee,<br>\
K,) indecl., with its last letter quiescent; and<br>\
properly is prefixed to a proposition; (S, L, K;)<br>\
as in جِئْتُكَ إِذْ قَامَ زَيدٌ [I came to thee when Zeyd<br>\
stood], and إِذْ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ and إِذْ زَيْدٌ يقُومُ [When<br>\
Zeyd was standing]. (S, L.) The proposition to<br>\
which it is prefixed is either nominal, as in [the<br>\
words of the Kur viii. 26,] وَاذْكُرُوا إِذْ أَنْتُمْ قَلِيلٌ<br>\
[And remember ye when ye were few]; or verbal,<br>\
having the verb in the pret. as to the letter and<br>\
as to the meaning, as in [the Kur ii. 28, &amp;c.,]<br>\
وَإِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ [And when thy Lord said<br>\
unto the angels]; or verbal with the verb in the<br>\
pret. as to the meaning but not as to the letter, as<br>\
in [the Kur ii. 121,] وَ إِذْ يَرْفَعُ إِبْرٰهِيمُ القَوَاعِدَ<br>\
[And when Abraham was rearing the foundations]; all three of which kinds are comprised in<br>\
the Kur where it is said, [ix. 40,] إِلَّا تَنْصُرُوهُ فَقَدْ<br>\
نَصَرَهُ اللّٰهُ إِذْ أَخْرَجَهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا ثَانِىَ اثْنَيْنِ إِذْ هُمَا<br>\
فِى الغَارِ إِذْ يَقُولُ لِصَاحِبِهِ لَا تَحزَنْ إِنَّ اللّٰهَ مَعَنَا<br>\
[If ye will not aid him, verily God aided him,<br>\
when those who disbelieved expelled him, being the<br>\
second of two, when they two were in the cave,<br>\
when he was saying to his companion, Grieve not<br>\
thou, for God is with us]. (Mughnee.) But<br>\
sometimes one half of the proposition is suppressed,<br>\
as in إِذْ ذَاكَ, [also written إِذَّاكَ,] meaning إِذْ ذَاكَ<br>\
كَذٰلِكَ [When that was so], or إِذْ ذَاكَ كَائِنٌ<br>\
[When that was, i. e. then, at that time]. (Mughnee.) And sometimes the whole of the proposition<br>\
is suppressed, (M, Mughnee,) as being known,<br>\
(Mughnee,) and tenween is substituted for it; the<br>\
ذ receiving kesreh because of the occurrence of<br>\
two quiescent letters together, (M, Mughnee,)<br>\
namely the ذ and the tenween, (M,) and thus one<br>\
says, يَوْمَئِذٍ; the kesreh of the ذ not being, as<br>\
Akh holds it to be, the kesreh of declension,<br>\
although اذ here occupies the place of a noun<br>\
governed in the gen. case by another prefixed to<br>\
it, (M, Mughnee,) for it still requires a proposition<br>\
to be understood after it, (Mughnee,) and is held<br>\
to be indecl. (M, Mughnee) by general consent,<br>\
like كَمْ and مَنْ, (M,) as being composed of two<br>\
letters. (Mughnee.) [J says,] when إِذْ is not<br>\
prefixed to a proposition, it has tenween: (S:)<br>\
and hence Aboo-Dhu-eyb says, (S, M,)<br>\
نَهَيْتُكَ عَنْ طِلَابِكَ أُمَّ عَمْرٍو<br>\
بِعَافِيَةٍ وَأَنْتَ إِذٍ صَحِيحُ<br>\
[I forbade thy suing Umm-&#39;Amr in health, thou<br>\
being then sound]; (S, M, L, Mughnee, TA; [but<br>\
in two copies of the S, for بِعَافِيَةٍ, I find بِعَاقِبَةٍ;<br>\
and in the L it is without any point;]) in which<br>\
[J says] the poet means حِينَئِذٍ, like as one says<br>\
يَوْمَئذٍ and لَيْلَتَئِذٍ: (S:) and Fr says that some of<br>\
the Arabs say, كَانَ كَذَا و كَذَا وَهُوَ إِذٍ صَبِىٌّ,<br>\
meaning هُوَ إِذْ ذَاكَ صَبِىٌّ [Such and such things<br>\
were, he being then a boy]. (T.) إِذِى also occurs<br>\
for اذ [app. إِذٍ, but whether this or إِذْ is not clear<br>\
in the MS. from which I take this]. (M.) When<br>\
إِذٍ is adjoined to nouns signifying times, the Arabs<br>\
join it therewith in writing, in certain instances:<br>\
namely حِينَئِذٍ [At that time, or then], and يَوْمَئِذٍ<br>\
[In, or on, or at, that day], and لَيْلَتَئِذٍ [In, or<br>\
on, or at, that night], and غَدَاتَئِذٍ [In, or on,<br>\
that morning], and عَشِيَّتَئِذٍ [In, or on, that evening], and سَاعَتَئِذٍ [In that hour: or at that time;<br>\
then], and عَامَئِذٍ [In that year], [and وَقْتَئِذٍ At<br>\
that time; then]; but they did not say الآنَئِذٍ,<br>\
because الآنَ denotes the nearest present time,<br>\
except in the dial. of Hudheyl, in which it has<br>\
been found to occur. (T.) When it is followed by<br>\
a verb, or by a noun not having the article ال prefixed to it, or [rather] by any movent letter, the<br>\
ذ of إِذْ is quieseent; but when it is followed by a<br>\
noun with ال, [or by any ا,] the ذ is mejroorah,<br>\
as in the saying,<br>\
إِذِ القَوْمُ كَانُوا نَازِلِينَ بِكَاظِمَهْ<br>\
[When the people, or company of men, were<br>\
alighting, or taking up their abode, at Kádhimeh].<br>\
(T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In general, (Mughnee, K,) it is an adverbial noun denoting past time, (M, Mughnee,<br>\
K,) when it is a noun denoting such time,<br>\
(Mughnee, K,) as in وَ إِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ [explained above], (M,) and in فَقَدْ نَصَرَهُ اللّٰهُ إِذْ<br>\
أَخْرَجَهُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا [also explained above, and in<br>\
other instances already mentioned]: (Mughnee,<br>\
K:) in the former of which instances, AO says<br>\
that it is redundant; (M, Mughnee;) but Aboo-Is-hák says that this is a bold assertion of his;<br>\
(M;) [and IHsh says,] this assertion is of no<br>\
account, and so is that of him who says that it<br>\
here denotes certainty, like قَدْ: (Mughnee:) [J<br>\
holds the opinion of AO on this point; for he<br>\
says,] إِذْ is sometimes redundant, like إِذَا, as in<br>\
the saying in the Kur [ii. 48], وَإِذْ وَاعَدْنَا مُوسَى,<br>\
meaning وَوَاعَدْنَا مُوسَى [And We appointed a<br>\
time with Moses; but instances of this kind are<br>\
most probably elliptical: see the next sentence].<br>\
(S.) As a noun denoting past time, it is [said to<br>\
be] also an objective complement of a verb, as in<br>\
[the Kur vii. 84,] وَاذْكُرُوا إِذْ كُنْتُمْ قَلِيلاً [And<br>\
remember ye when ye were few]: (Mughnee, K:)<br>\
and generally in the commencements of narratives<br>\
in the Kur, it may be an objective complement of<br>\
أُذْكُرْ understood, as in وَ إِذْ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلْمَلَائِكَةِ<br>\
[before cited], and the like. (Mughnee: but see<br>\
the third of the sentences here following.) As<br>\
such, it is [said to be] also a substitute for the<br>\
objective complement of a verb, as in [the Kur<br>\
xix. 16,] وَ اذْكُرْ فِى الْكِتَابِ مَرْيَمَ إِذِ انْتَبَذَتْ [And<br>\
mention thou, or remember thou, in the Scripture,<br>\
Mary, the time when she withdrew aside], where<br>\
اذ is a substitute of implication for مريم. (Mughnee, K: but see the second of the sentences here<br>\
following.) As such, it also has prefixed to it a<br>\
noun of time, of such a kind that it is without<br>\
need thereof, as in يَوْمَئِذٍ, or not of such a kind<br>\
that it is without need thereof, as in [the Kur iii. 6,]<br>\
بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا [After the time when Thou hast<br>\
directed us aright]. (Mughnee, K.) And it is<br>\
generally asserted, that it never occurs otherwise<br>\
than as an adverbial noun, or as having a noun<br>\
prefixed to it; that in the like of وَاذْكُرُوا إِذْ كُنْتُمْ<br>\
قَلِيلاً, it is an adverbial noun relating to an objective complement suppressed, i. e. وَ اذْكُرُوا نِعْمَةَ اللّٰهِ<br>\
عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنْتُمْ قَلِيلاً [And remember ye the grace<br>\
of God towards you when ye were few]; and in<br>\
the like of إِذِ انْتَبَذَتْ, that it is an adverbial noun<br>\
relating to a suppressed prefixed noun to [that<br>\
which becomes by the suppression] the objective<br>\
complement of a verb, i. e. [in this instance]<br>\
وَ اذْكُرْ قِصَّةَ مَرْيَمَ [And mention thou, or remember thou, the case of Mary]: and this assertion<br>\
is strengthened by the express mention of the<br>\
[proper] objective complement in [the Kur iii. 98,]<br>\
وَ اذْكُروا نِعْمَةَ اللّٰهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ كُنْتُمْ أَعْدَآءً [And remember ye the grace of God towards you when ye<br>\
were enemies]. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (Mughnee,<br>\
K,) accord. to some, (T, Mughnee,) it is used (T,<br>\
Mughnee, K) as a noun (Mughnee, K) to indicate future time, (T, Mughnee, K,) and إِذَا is<br>\
said to denote past time, (T,) [i. e.] each of these<br>\
occurs in the place of the other; (TA;) the former<br>\
being used to indicate future time in the Kur<br>\
[xxxiv. 50], where it is said, وَلَوْ تَرَى إِذْ فَزِعُوا<br>\
[And couldst thou see the time when they shall be<br>\
terrified], meaning the day of resurrection; this<br>\
usage being allowable, says Fr, only because the<br>\
proposition is like one expressing a positive fact,<br>\
since there is no doubt of the coming of that day;<br>\
(T;) and in [the Kur xcix. 4,] يَوْمَئِذٍ تُحَدِّثُ أَخْبَارَهَا<br>\
[On that day, she (the earth) shall tell her tidings];<br>\
(Mughnee, K;) this being generally regarded as<br>\
similar to the expression of a future event which<br>\
must necessarily happen as though it had already<br>\
happened; but it may be urged in favour of those<br>\
who hold a different opinion that it is said in the<br>\
Kur [xl. 72 and 73], فَسَوْفَ يَعْلَمُونَ إِذِ الأَغلَالُ فِى<br>\
أَعْنَاقِهِمْ [They shall hereafter know, when the<br>\
collars shall be on their necks]; for يعلمون is a<br>\
future as to the letter and the meaning because of<br>\
its having سوف conjoined with it, and it governs<br>\
اذ, which is therefore in the place of إِذَا. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It also indicates a cause, as in [the Kur<br>\
xliii. 38,] لَنْ يَنْفَعَكُمُ الْيَوْمَ إِذْ ظَلَمْتُمْ [It will not<br>\
profit you this day, since, or because, ye have<br>\
acted wrongfully], (Mughnee, K,) i. e. because<br>\
of your having acted wrongfully in the sublunary<br>\
state of existence; (Bd, Mughnee;) but it is disputed whether it be in this instance a particle in<br>\
the place of the causative ل, or an adverbial<br>\
noun: (Mughnee:) Aboo-&#39;Alee seems to hold<br>\
that اذ ظلمتم [as meaning when ye have acted<br>\
wrongfully] is a substitute for, or a kind of repetition of, اليوم; an event happening in the present<br>\
world being spoken of as though it happened in<br>\
the world to come because the latter immediately<br>\
follows the former. (IJ, M, L, Mughnee.) You<br>\
say also, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ إِذْ جِئْتَ [Praise be to God<br>\
because, or that, thou camest, or hast come]. (S<br>\
in art. جيأ.) ―<br>\
-b5-  It is also used to denote one&#39;s<br>\
experiencing the occurrence of a thing when he<br>\
is in a particular state; (S, L;) or to denote a<br>\
thing&#39;s happening suddenly, or unexpectedly; (S,<br>\
Mughnee, K;) like إِذَا; (S;) and in this case is<br>\
only followed by a verb expressing an event as a<br>\
positive fact, (S, L,) and occurs after بَيْنَا and بَيْنَمَا;<br>\
(Mughnee, K;) as [in exs. voce بَيْنَ; and] in<br>\
بَيْنَمَا أَنَا كَذَا إِذْ جَآءَ زَيْدٌ [While I was thus, or in<br>\
this state, lo, or behold, or there, or then, at that<br>\
time, (accord. to different authorities, as will be<br>\
seen below,) Zeyd came]; (S, L;) and as in the<br>\
saying of a poet,<br>\
اِسْتَقْدِرِ اللّٰهَ خَيْراً وَارْضَيَنَّ بِهِ<br>\
فَبَيْنَمَاالْعُسْرُ إِذ دَارَتْ مَيَاسِيرُ<br>\
[Beg thou God to appoint for thee good, and do<br>\
thou be content therewith; for while there has<br>\
been difficulty, lo, easy circumstances have come<br>\
about]: (Mughnee, K: *) but it is disputed whether it be [in this case] an adverbial noun of<br>\
place, (Mughnee, K,) as Zj and AHei hold;<br>\
(TA;) or of time, (Mughnee, K,) as Mbr holds;<br>\
(TA;) or a particle denoting the sudden, or<br>\
unexpected, occurrence of a thing, (Mughnee, K,)<br>\
as IB and Ibn-Málik hold; (TA;) or a corroborative, i. e. [grammatically] redundant, particle,<br>\
(Mughnee, K,) an opinion which Ibn-Ya&#39;eesh<br>\
holds, and to which Er-Radee inclines. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
It is also a conditional particle, but only used as<br>\
such coupled with ما, (S, L, Mughnee, *) and<br>\
causes two aorists to assume the mejzoom form,<br>\
(Mughnee,) as when you say, إِذْمَا تَأْتِنِى آتِكَ<br>\
[When, or whenever, thou shalt come to me, I<br>\
will come to thee], like as you say, إِنْ تأْتِنِى وَقْتًا<br>\
آتِكَ [If thou come to me at some, or any, time, I<br>\
will come to thee]; and you say also إِذْمَا أَتَيْتَ<br>\
[like as you say, إِنْ أَتَيْتَ, using the pret. in the<br>\
sense of the future]: (S, L:) it is a particle<br>\
accord. to Sb, used in the manner of the conditional إِنْ; but it is an adverbial noun accord. to<br>\
Mbr and Ibn-Es-Sarráj and El-Fárisee. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [What I have translated from the S, L,<br>\
K, and TA, in this art., is mostly from فصل الهمزة<br>\
of باب الذال : the rest, from باب الالف اللينّة.]<br>\
