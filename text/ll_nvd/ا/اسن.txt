اَسَنَ, (S, M, &amp;c.,) inf. n. أَسَنٌ;<br>\
(S, M, Msb;) said of water, i. q. أَجَنَ and أَجِنَ;<br>\
(S, K;) [i. e.] It became altered for the worse<br>\
(M, Mgh, Msb) in odour, (M,) [or in taste and<br>\
colour, from some such cause as long standing,<br>\
(see أَجَنَ,)] but was drinkable; (M;) or so as not<br>\
to be drunk, (Msb, TA,) thus differing from أَجَنَ<br>\
and أَجِنَ. (TA.) [See also أَصِلَ.]<br>\
أَسِنٌ: see what follows.<br>\
آسِنٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ أَسِنٌ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) applied to water, (S, Mgh, &amp;c.,) i. q. آجِنٌ<br>\
[and أَجِنٌ]; (S, K;) [i. e.] Altered for the worse<br>\
(Mgh, Msb) in odour, (Mgh,) [or in taste and<br>\
colour, from some such cause as long standing<br>\
but drinkable; (see above, and see آجِنٌ;)] or<br>\
so as not to be drunk, (Msb, TA,) thus differing<br>\
from آجِنٌ and أَجِنٌ: (TA:) pl. [of the former]<br>\
آسَانٌ [like as أَطْهَارٌ is pl. of طَاهِرٌ, or perhaps it<br>\
may have for its sing. أَسْنٌ, like أَجْنٌ]. (M, TA.)<br>\
مَنْ مَآءٍ غَيْرِ آسِنٍ, in the Kur [xlvii. 16], is explained by Fr as meaning Of water not altered<br>\
for the worse; not آجِن. (TA.)<br>\
