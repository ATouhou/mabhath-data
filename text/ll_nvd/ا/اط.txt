أَطَّ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
اَطِ3َ, (K,) inf. n. أَطِيطٌ (S, K)<br>\
and أَطٌّ, (TA,) It produced, made, gave, emitted,<br>\
or uttered, a sound, noise, voice, or cry; (S, K;)<br>\
[and particularly, it creaked; and it moaned;]<br>\
said of a camel&#39;s saddle, (S, * K, [in the CK,<br>\
الرَّجُلُ is put by mistake for الرَّحْلُ ]) [and particularly of a new camel&#39;s saddle,] and the like,<br>\
(K,) such as a [plaited or woven girth called]<br>\
نِسْع and of everything of which the sound<br>\
resembles that of a new camel&#39;s saddle, (TA,) and<br>\
of a palm-trunk, and of a tree of the kind called<br>\
سِدْر, (S TA,) or of the kind called سَرْح, (TA,)<br>\
and of a cane or reed on the occasion of its being<br>\
straightened, [in which instance it is said to be<br>\
tropical, but if so it is tropical in several other<br>\
instances,] and of a bow, (TA,) and of the belly<br>\
by reason of emptiness, (S,* TA,) and, in a trad.<br>\
of Aboo-Dharr, (tropical:)  of heaven, or the sky, notwithstanding there being [really] no أَطِيط in this<br>\
instance, for it is meant to denote [the presence<br>\
of] multitude, and confirmation of the majesty of<br>\
God. (TA.) [It is also said of other things, as<br>\
will be shown by phrases here following, and by<br>\
explanations of أَطِيطٌ below.] You also say, أَطَّتِ<br>\
الإِبِلُ, (K,) aor. as above, inf. n. أَطِيطٌ, (TA,)<br>\
The camels moaned by reason of fatigue, or<br>\
uttering their yearning cry to their young, (K,<br>\
TA,) and sometimes by reason of fulness of their<br>\
udders with milk. (TA.) And لَا آتِيكَ مَا أَطَّتِ الإِبِلُ<br>\
I will not come to thee as long as camels utter cries<br>\
[or moan] by reason of the heaviness of their loads.<br>\
(S.) And لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ مَا أَطَّتِ الإِبِلُ, meaning<br>\
I will not do that ever. (TA.) And مَا لَنَا بَعِيرٌ يَئِطُّ<br>\
We have not a camel that moans, or cries; meaning we have not any camel; for the camel cannot<br>\
but do so. (TA, from a trad.) [See also أَطِيطٌ,<br>\
below.] And أَطَّتْ لَهُ رَحِمِى (tropical:)  [My feeling of<br>\
relationship, or sympathy of blood,] became<br>\
affected with tenderness, or compassion, and became moved, [or rather pleaded,] for him [or in<br>\
his favour]: (K, TA:) and hence ↓التَّأَطُّطُ [inf. n.<br>\
of the verb in the syn. phrase تَأَطَّطَتْ لَهُ رَحِمِى].<br>\
(Sgh, TA.) And أَطَّتْ بِكَ الرَّحِمُ [The feeling of<br>\
relationship, or sympathy of blood, pleaded, or<br>\
hath pleaded, in thee;] i. e., inclined thee to<br>\
favour. (Ham p. 765.) [See another ex. voce<br>\
حَاسَّةٌ.]<br>\

تَاَطَّ3َ see 1, near the end.<br>\
أَطٌّ: see أَطِيطٌ, below.<br>\
نُسُوعٌ أُطَّطٌ [pl. of آطٌّ, part. n. of 1,] Creaking<br>\
[plaited, or woven, thongs]. (K.)<br>\
أَطِيطٌ [as explained in what here follows seems<br>\
to be properly an inf. n., though, like all inf. ns.,<br>\
it may be used as a subst.:] The sounding, or the<br>\
like, or the sound, or the like, [and particularly<br>\
the creaking, or creaking sound, and the moaning,<br>\
or moaning sound,] of a camel&#39;s saddle (S, K,<br>\
TA) when new; (TA;) and so ↓أَطٌّ of the litters<br>\
and saddles of camels when the riders are heavy<br>\
thereon; and the former, also, of a door; said, in<br>\
a trad., of the gate of paradise, by reason of its<br>\
being crowded; (TA;) and of a plaited or woven<br>\
thong when stretching; (Ez-Zejjájee, TA;) and<br>\
of the back [when strained]; (K;) and of the<br>\
bowels, (TA,) and of the belly, or inside, by<br>\
reason of hunger, (K,) or by reason of vehement<br>\
hunger; (TA;) and of camels, (S, K,) by reason<br>\
of their burdens, (K,) or by reason of the heaviness of their burdens; (S;) and the prolonging<br>\
of the cries of camels: (TA:) but &#39;Alee Ibn-<br>\
Hamzeh says that the cry of camels is termed<br>\
رُغَآءٌ, and that أَطِيطٌ signifies the sounding, or<br>\
sound, of their bellies, or insides, by reason of<br>\
repletion from drinking. (IB, TA.) أَهْلٌ صَهِيلٍ<br>\
ؤَأَطِيطٍ, occurring in a trad., means (assumed tropical:)  Possessors<br>\
of horses and of camels. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:) Hunger, (K, TA,) itself, as well as the sound of the<br>\
bowels or belly by reason thereof: from EzZejjájee. (TA.)<br>\
أَطَّاطٌ Sounding much; noisy; (K, TA;) having<br>\
a sound: applied [to any of the things mentioned<br>\
above in the explanations of أَطَّ and أَطِيطٌ; and]<br>\
to a hide; and to a camel repleted with drink;<br>\
and to a road: fem. with ة: which, applied to a<br>\
woman, signifies one whose فَرْج has a sound<br>\
إِذَا جُومِعَتْ. (TA.)<br>\
