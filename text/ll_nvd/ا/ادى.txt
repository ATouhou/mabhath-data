أدّاهُ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) inf. n. تأٌدِيَةٌ (T, S, K)<br>\
and أَدَآءٌ, (T,) or the latter is a simple subst.,<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K,) [and so, accord. to the Msb,<br>\
is the former also, but this is a mistake,] He<br>\
made it, or caused it, to reach, arrive, or come<br>\
[to the appointed person or place &amp;c.]; he brought,<br>\
conveyed, or delivered, it; syn. أَوْصَلَهُ; (M, Msb,<br>\
K;) namely, a thing; (M;) as, for instance,<br>\
الأَمَانَةَ إِلَى أهْلِهَا [the thing committed to his<br>\
trust and care, to its owner]: (Msb:) he delivered it, gave it up, or surrendered it: (T:)<br>\
he payed it, or discharged it; (S, K;) namely,<br>\
his debt, (S,) a bloodwit, a responsibility, and<br>\
the like; (Msb in art. غرم;) [and hence,] أَدَّى مَا<br>\
عَلَيْهِ [he acquitted himself of that which was<br>\
incumbent on him; or payed, or discharged,<br>\
what he owed]: (T:) he performed, fulfilled,<br>\
or accomplished, it; namely, [for instance,]<br>\
الحَجَّ [the pilgrimage]; (Msb in art. قضى;)<br>\
and in like manner, المَنَاسِكَ [the religious rites<br>\
and ceremonies of the pilgrimage]. (Jel in ii.<br>\
196, and Msb ubi suprà.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[xliv. 17], أَنْ أَدُّوا إلَىَّ عِبَادَ اللّٰهِ, meaning Deliver<br>\
ye to me [the servants of God,] the children of<br>\
Israel: or, as some say, the meaning is, أَدُّوا إِلَىَّ<br>\
مَا أَمَرَكُمُ اللّٰهُ بِهِ يَا عِبَادَاللّٰهِ [perform ye to me<br>\
that which God hath commanded you to do, O<br>\
servants of God]: or it may mean listen ye,<br>\
or give ye ear, to me; as though the speaker said,<br>\
أَدُّوا إِلَىَّ سَمْعَكُمْ; the verb being used in this sense<br>\
by the Arabs. (T.) And one says, لَهُ ↓ تأَدَّيْتُ,<br>\
مِنْ حَقِّهِ, (K, TA,) and إلَيْهِ, in the place of لَهُ,<br>\
meaning أَدَّيْتُهُ; (TA;) i. e. I payed him his<br>\
due, or right. (K, TA.) And a man says,<br>\
↓ مَا أَدْرِى كَيْفَ أَتَأَدَّى [I know not how to pay].<br>\
(TA.) One says also, أدّى عَنْهُ [meaning He<br>\
payed, or made satisfaction, for him]: and أدّى<br>\
عَنْهُ الخَرَاجَ [He payed for him, or in his stead,<br>\
the land-tax]. (Mgh in art. جزأ.) [Hence,]<br>\
El-Akhnas says,<br>\
فَأَدَّيْتُ عَنِّى مَا اسْتَعَرتُ مِنَ الصِّبَا<br>\
وَ لِلْمَالِ عِنْدِىِ اليَوْمَ رَاعٍ وَ كَاسِبُ<br>\
i. e. But I have put away from me [what I had<br>\
borrowed, or assumed, of the folishness of youth,<br>\
and amorous dalliance,] and now I am [or<br>\
there is at my abode] a keeper and collector to<br>\
the camels, or cattle, or property. (Ham p. 346.)<br>\

-b2-  [أَدَّى إِلى كَذَا is a phrase often used as<br>\
meaning It brought, conducted, led, or conduced,<br>\
to such a thing or state; as, for instance, crime<br>\
to punishment or to ignominy.]<br>\

تأدّى إِلَيْهِ الخَبَرُ The information, or news,<br>\
reached him. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 2, in two places.<br>\
10<br>\
استأداهُ مَالًا He desired, or sought, to obtain<br>\
from him property, or sued, or prosecuted, him<br>\
for it, or demanded it of him, (S, K,) and<br>\
extracted it, (S,) or took it, or received it, (K,)<br>\
from him. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also art. ادو.<br>\
أَدَآءٌ a subst. from 2 [signifying The act of<br>\
making, or causing, to reach, arrive, or come<br>\
to the appointed person or place &amp;c.; of bringing,<br>\
conveying, or delivering; of giving up, or surrendering; payment, or discharge, of a debt &amp;c.;<br>\
the act of acquitting oneself of that which is<br>\
incumbent on him; performance, fulfilment, or<br>\
accomplishment]. (S, M, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
هُوَ حَسَنُ الأَدَآءِ He has a good manner of pronouncing, or uttering, the letters. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَدَآءٌ<br>\
as a term of the law signifies The performance<br>\
of an act of religious service [such as prayer &amp;c.]<br>\
at the appointed time: opposed to قَضَآءٌ, performance at a time other than that which is<br>\
appointed. (Msb and TA in art. قضى.)<br>\
أَدِىٌّ : see art. ادو.<br>\
آدَى [a noun denoting the comparative and<br>\
superlative degrees, irregularly formed from the<br>\
verb أَدّى; like as the noun آدَى mentioned in<br>\
art. ادو is irregularly formed from the verb آدَى].<br>\
You say, هُوَ آدَى لِلأَمَانةِ [He is more, or better,<br>\
disposed to deliver, give up, or surrender, the<br>\
thing committed to his trust and care] (T, S,<br>\
M, K) مِنْكَ [than thou], (S,) or مِنْ غَيْرِهِ [than<br>\
another than he]. (M, * K.) [Az says,] the<br>\
vulgar say, أَدَّى لِلْأَمَانَةِ; but this is incorrect,<br>\
and not allowable; and I have not known any<br>\
one of the grammarians allow آدَى, because أَفْعَل<br>\
denoting wonder [and the comparative and superlative degrees] is not formed but from the triliteral [verb], and one does not say, أَدَى in the<br>\
sense of أَدَّى: the proper phrase is أَحْسَنُ أَدَآءً.<br>\
