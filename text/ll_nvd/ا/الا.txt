load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'الاأَلَا [in its primitive acceptation, being composed<br>\
of the interrogative hemzeh and the negative لا,]<br>\
denotes an interrogation respecting a negative,<br>\
as in the saying [of the poet],<br>\
أَلَا اصْطِبَارَ لِسَلْمَى أَمْ لَهَا جَلَدٌ<br>\
إِذَا أُلَاقِى الَّذِى لَاقَاهُ أَمْثَالِى<br>\
[Is there not any patience belonging to Selmà,<br>\
or has she hardiness, when I experience what<br>\
persons like me have experienced?]: (Mughnee,<br>\
K:) and when used in this manner, it is put<br>\
before a nominal proposition only, and governs<br>\
like the negative لا [when used without the<br>\
interrogative hemzeh]. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It also<br>\
denotes a wish; as in the saying [of the poet],<br>\
أَلَا عُمْرَ وَلَّى مُسْتَطَاعٌ رُجُوعُهُ<br>\
فَيَرْأَبَ مَا أَثْأَتْ يَدُ الغَفَلَاتِ<br>\
[May there not be a life which has declined<br>\
whereof the returning is possible, so that it may<br>\
repair what the hand of negligences hath marred?];<br>\
for which reason يرأب is mansoob, because it is<br>\
the complement of a wish, coupled with فَ: and<br>\
used in this manner, also, it is put before a<br>\
nominal proposition only, [ولّى in the verse<br>\
above being a qualificative, like an epithet,] and<br>\
it governs like the negative لا [without the interrogative hemzeh], and has no enunciative<br>\
either expressed or understood. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
It also denotes reproof, or reproach, (T, Mughnee,<br>\
K,) and disapproval; as in the saying [of the<br>\
poet],<br>\
أَلَا ارْعِوَآءَ لِمَنْ وَلَتْ شَبِيْبَتُهُ<br>\
وَاذَنَتْ بِمَشِيبٍ بَعْدَهُ هَرَمُ<br>\
[Is there no self-restraint to him whose youth<br>\
hath declined, and announced hoariness, after<br>\
which is to follow decrepitude?]: (Mughnee,<br>\
K:) and used in this manner, also, it is put<br>\
before a nominal proposition only, and governs<br>\
as in the cases mentioned above, (Mughnee,) or<br>\
before a verb [also], which is always marfooa;<br>\
as in the phrase أَلَا تَنَدَّمَ عَلَى فِعَالِكَ [Dost not<br>\
thou repent of thine actions?] and أَلَا تَسْتَحْيِى<br>\
مِنْ جِيرَانِكَ [Art not thou ashamed for thyself,<br>\
or of thyself, with respect to thy neighbours?]<br>\
and أَلَا تَخَافُ رَبَّكَ [Dost not thou fear thy Lord?].<br>\
(T.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It also denotes عَرْضٌ, (T,) or العَرْضُ,<br>\
and التَّحْضِيضُ, both of which signify the asking,<br>\
or requiring, a thing; (Mughnee, K; *) but the<br>\
former means the doing so with gentleness;<br>\
(Mughnee, K;) and the latter, the doing so<br>\
with urgency: (Mughnee:) and when used in<br>\
this manner, [also,] it is said to be composed of<br>\
لا with the interrogative hemzeh; (TA;) and<br>\
is put before a verbal proposition only; (Mughnee;) as in the saying [in the Kur xxiv. 22],<br>\
أَلَا تُحِبُّونَ أَنْ يَغْفِرَ اللّٰهُ لَكُمْ [Do not ye, or wherefore do not ye, (see أَمَا,) like that God should<br>\
forgive you?] (Mughnee, K,) and [in the same,<br>\
ix. 13,] أَلَاتُقَاتِلُونَ قًوْمًا نَكَثُوا أَيْمَانَهُمْ [Will not<br>\
ye, or wherefore will not ye, fight a people who<br>\
have broken their oaths?]; (Mughnee;) or<br>\
before a mejzoom or marfooa aor., both of these<br>\
forms being mentioned on the authority of the<br>\
Arabs, as in أَلَا تَنْزِلْ تَأْكُلْ and أَلَا تَنْزِلُ تَأْكُلُ<br>\
[Wilt not thou, or wherefore wilt not thou, alight<br>\
and eat?]. (Ks, T.) ―<br>\
-b5-  It is also an inceptive<br>\
particle, (S, Mughnee, K,) of which those who<br>\
parse show the place but neglect the meaning,<br>\
(Mughnee,) used to give notice of something<br>\
about to be said, [like as Now, and why, (by<br>\
the former of which I think it is generally best<br>\
rendered when thus used,) are often employed<br>\
in our language, and like as<br>\
ἀλλὰ (which is<br>\
remarkable for its near agreement with it in<br>\
sound) is often used in Greek,] (S, Mughnee, K,)<br>\
and importing averment, because it is composed<br>\
of the interrogative hemzeh and the negative لا<br>\
which, when thus composed, have this import,<br>\
(Mughnee, K,) like أَلَمْ, and أَلَيْسَ, because the<br>\
interrogative particle resembles the particle of<br>\
negation, and the negation of a negation is an<br>\
affirmation, (Ham p. 589,) and like أَمَا before<br>\
an oath: (Z, Mughnee:) [it may therefore be<br>\
further rendered by our word surely;; for this<br>\
word (as Dr. Johnson says in his Dictionary)<br>\
&quot;is often used rather to intend and strengthen<br>\
the meaning of the sentence, than with any<br>\
distinct and explicable meaning:&quot;] or it signifies<br>\
حَقًّا [verily, or truly]: (M voce أَمَا:) it is put<br>\
before both the [kinds of] propositions, [the<br>\
nominal and the verbal;] (Mughnee;) as in<br>\
the saying [in the Kur ii. 12], أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ السُّفَهَآءُ<br>\
[meaning Now surely it is they who are the<br>\
lightwitted], (Mughnee, K,) and [in the same,<br>\
xi. 11,] أَلَا يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمْ لَيْسَ مَصْرُوفًا عَنْهُمْ [meaning<br>\
Now surely, on the day of its coming to them,<br>\
it shall not be averted from them], (Mughnee,)<br>\
in which يَوْمَ يَأْتِيهِمْ appears to be the object<br>\
of government of مَصْرُوفًا, which is the enunciative of لَيْسَ whence it has been argued that,<br>\
as the object of government of the enunciative<br>\
of ليس precedes that verb, the enunciative itself<br>\
may precede it: (I &#39;Ak pp. 74 and 75:) [J says,]<br>\
you say, أَلَا إِنَّ زَيْدًا خَارِجٌ [Now surely Zeyd is<br>\
going forth], like as you say, إِعْلَمْ أَنَّ زَيْدًا خَارِجٌ<br>\
[Know thou that Zeyd is going forth]: (S:)<br>\
Ks says, أَلَا is used to give notice of what is<br>\
about to be said, and is followed by a command<br>\
and a prohibition and an enunciation, as in أَلَا قُمْ<br>\
[Now stand thou], and أَلَا لَا تَقُمْ [Now stand<br>\
not thou], and أَلَا إِنَّ زَيْدًا قَدْ قَامَ [Now surely<br>\
Zeyd has stood, or has just now stood]. (T.)<br>\
When it is put before the particle [يَا] used to<br>\
give notice of what is about to be said, it is<br>\
merely an inceptive, as in the saying. [of the<br>\
poet],<br>\
أَلَا يَا اسْلَمِى يَا دَارَ مَىَّ عَلَى البِلَى<br>\
[Now be thou free from evil, O abode of Meiyà,<br>\
during wear and tear]. (AAF, M.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Lth says,<br>\
sometimes أَلَا is immediately followed by another<br>\
لا; and he cites the following ex.:<br>\
فَقَامَ يَذُودُ النَّاسَ عَنَّا بِسَيْفِهِ<br>\
يَقُولُ أَلَا لَا مِنْ سَبِيلٍ إِلَى هِنْدِ<br>\
[Then he began to drive away the people from us,<br>\
saying, Now is there no way to Hind?]: and<br>\
one says to a man, &quot;Did such and such things<br>\
happen?&quot; and he answers, أَلَا لَا [Why no]:<br>\
he holds الا to be used to give notice of what<br>\
is about to be said, and لا to be a negative. (T.)<br>\
أُلَا and الأُلَا, and أُلَآءِ &amp;c.: see art. الى.<br>\
أَلَّا is a particle denoting تَحْضِيض; (Msb in<br>\
art. حض, Mughnee, K;) i. e., when followed by<br>\
a future, exciting to an action, and seeking or<br>\
desiring or demanding the performance of it;<br>\
and when followed by a preterite, reproof for not<br>\
doing a thing; (Msb ubi suprà;) syn. with هَلَّا;<br>\
(T, TA;) and peculiar to enunciative verbal propositions, (Mughnee, K,) like the other particles<br>\
used for the same purpose. (Mughnee.) You<br>\
say, [أَلَّا تَفْعَلُ كَذَا Wherefore wilt not thou do<br>\
such a thing? and] أَلَّا . فَعَلْتَ كَذَا [Wherefore<br>\
didst not thou such a thing?] (T, TA,) meaning,<br>\
(TA,) or as though meaning, (T,) لِمَ لَمْ تَفْعَلْ كَذَا.<br>\
(T, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  It also means أَنْ لَا; the ن being<br>\
incorporated into the ل, which is written with<br>\
teshdeed: (T, TA:) in which case, it is not to be<br>\
confounded with the foregoing particle. (Mughnee.) You say, أَمَرْتُهُ أَلَّا يَفْعَلَ ذَاكَ [I commanded<br>\
him that he should not do that]; and you may<br>\
say, أَمَرْتُهُ أَنْ لَا يَفْعَلَ ذَاكَ: it occurs in the old<br>\
copies of the Kur written in the former manner<br>\
in some places, and in the latter manner in other<br>\
places. (T, TA.) In the saying in the Kur<br>\
[xxvii. 31], أَلَّا تَعْلُوا عَلَىَّ, [which may mean That<br>\
ye exalt not yourselves against me, or exalt ye not<br>\
yourselves against me,] it may be a compound of<br>\
أَنْ governing a mansoob aor. and the negative لَا,<br>\
or of the explicative أَنْ and the prohibitive لا.<br>\
(Mughnee.) [It often has لِ prefixed to it, forming<br>\
the compound لِئَلَّا, which signifies That, or in<br>\
order that,... not; and may frequently be<br>\
rendered by lest; as in the Kur ii. 145, لِئَلَّا يَكُونَ<br>\
لِلنَّاسِ عَلَيْكُمْ حُجَّةٌ That, or in order that, there<br>\
may not be, or lest there should be, to men,<br>\
against you, any allegation.]<br>\
إِلَّا, [regarded as a simple word,] not to be<br>\
confounded with the compound of the conditional<br>\
إِنْ and the negative لَا, (Mughnee at the end of<br>\
the article on this word,) is used in four manners.<br>\
(The same in the beginning of the art.) First,<br>\
(Mughnee,) it is used (as a particle, S, Msb,) to<br>\
denote exception; [meaning Except, save, or<br>\
saving; and sometimes but; and sometimes but<br>\
not; as will be seen below;] (T, S, Msb, Mughnee, K; [in which last it is mentioned in art. ال,<br>\
and again, as in the S, in the last division of<br>\
the work;]) and to denote exception, it is used<br>\
in five manners; after an affirmation, and a<br>\
negation, and a portion of a sentence devoid of<br>\
the mention of that from which the exception is<br>\
made, and when the thing excepted precedes that<br>\
from which the exception is made, and when these<br>\
two are disunited in kind, in which last case it<br>\
has the meaning of لٰكِنَّ [but when the sentence<br>\
is negative, and but not when the sentence is<br>\
affirmative]. (S, TA.) You say, قَامَ القَوْمُ إِلَّا زَيْدًا<br>\
[The people, or company of men, stood, except<br>\
Zeyd]; i. e., Zeyd was not included in the predicament of the people, or company of men:<br>\
(Msb:) and it is said in the Kur [ii. 250], (T,)<br>\
فَشَرِبُوا مِنْهُ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا مِنْهُمْ [And they drank of it,<br>\
except a few of them]: (T, Mughnee, K:) here<br>\
قليلا is governed in the accus. case by الّا, (Mughnee, K,) accord. to the most correct opinion:<br>\
(Mughnee:) accord. to Th, it is so because there<br>\
is no negation in the beginning of the sentence.<br>\
(T.) And it is also said in the Kur [iv. 69], (T,)<br>\
مَا فَعَلُوهُ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ مِنْهُمْ [They had not done it, or<br>\
they would not do it, except a few of them]: (T,<br>\
Mughnee, K:) here قليل is in the nom. case as<br>\
being a partial substitute, (Mughnee, K,) accord.<br>\
to the Basrees, (Mughnee,) i. e., as being a<br>\
[partial] substitute for the [pronoun] و [in فعلوه],<br>\
for it may here be so without perversion of the<br>\
meaning, whereas it cannot be so without such<br>\
perversion when the sentence is affirmative:<br>\
(TA:) accord. to the Koofees, الّا is a conjunction,<br>\
like the conjunctive لَا: (Mughnee:) accord. to<br>\
Th, قليل is here in the nom. case because the<br>\
sentence commences with a negative: (T:) or in<br>\
a sentence [like this,] which is not affirmative, in<br>\
which the thing excepted is united in kind to that<br>\
from which the exception is made, accord. to the<br>\
opinion which is generally preferred and which<br>\
commonly obtains, the noun signifying the thing<br>\
excepted is a substitute for the noun signifying<br>\
that from which the exception is made; but it is<br>\
allowable to put it in the accus. case according to<br>\
the general rule respecting exception; so that one<br>\
says, مَا قَامَ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا زَيْدٌ and إِلَّا زَيْدًا [There stood<br>\
not any one, except Zeyd]: and the same is the<br>\
case in a prohibitive sentence; as in لَا يَقُمْ أَحَدٌ<br>\
إِلَّا زَيْدٌ and إِلَّا زَيْدًا [Let not any one stand, except<br>\
Zeyd]; and in an interrogative sentence; as in<br>\
هَلْ قَامَ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا زَيْدٌ and إِلَّا زَيْدًا [Did any one stand,<br>\
except Zeyd?]; when, in such sentences, the thing<br>\
excepted is united in kind to that from which the<br>\
exception is made. (I &#39;Ak p. 162.) You say also,<br>\
مَا جَآءَنِى إِلَّا زَيْدٌ [There came not to me any, save<br>\
Zeyd], without mentioning that from which the<br>\
exception is made; (TA;) and مَا ضَرَبْتُ إِلَّا زَيْدًا<br>\
[I beat not any, save Zeyd]; and مَا مَرَرْتُ إِلَّا بِزَيْدٍ<br>\
[I passed not by any, save by Zeyd]; (I&#39; Ak<br>\
p. 164;) the case of the noun signifying the thing<br>\
excepted being the same as if الّا were not mentioned: (I&#39; Ak ubi suprà, and TA:*) but you<br>\
may not say, affirmatively, ضَرَبْتُ إِلَّا زَيْدًا, or the<br>\
like. (I &#39;Ak ubi suprà.) When the thing excepted<br>\
precedes that from which the exception is made,<br>\
if the sentence is affirmative, the noun signifying<br>\
the former must be in the accus. case; as in<br>\
قَامَ إِلَّا زَيْدًا القَوْمُ [Except Zeyd, the people, or<br>\
company of men, stood]: and so, accord. to the<br>\
usage generally preferred, when the sentence is<br>\
not affirmative; as in مَاقَامَ إِلَّا زَيْدًا القَوْمُ [Except<br>\
Zeyd, the people, or company of men, stood not];<br>\
but recorded instances allow one&#39;s saying also,<br>\
مَا قَامَ إِلَّا زَيْدٌ القَوْمُ. (I &#39;Ak p. 163.) When the<br>\
thing excepted is disunited in kind from that from<br>\
which the exception is made, if the sentence is<br>\
affirmative, the noun signifying the former must<br>\
likewise be in the accus. case; as in قَامَ القَوْمُ إِلَّا<br>\
حِمَارًا [The people, or company of men, stood, but<br>\
not an ass], and ضَرَبْتُ القَوْمَ إِلَّا حِمَارًا [I beat the<br>\
people, but not an ass], &amp;c.: (I&#39; Ak p. 162:) and<br>\
so, accord. to the generality of the Arabs, when<br>\
the sentence is negative; as in مَا قَامَ القَوْمُ إِلَّا حِمَارًا<br>\
[The people stood not, but an ass]; (I&#39; Ak p. 163;)<br>\
and مَا رَأَيْتُ القَوْمَ إِلَّا حِمَارًا [I saw not the people,<br>\
but an ass]; الّا being here syn. with لٰكِنَّ; as<br>\
also in the Kur [xlii. 22], where it is said,<br>\
لَا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَةَ فِى القُرْبَى [I ask<br>\
not of you a recompense for it, but affection in<br>\
respect of relationship]; (Msb;) and in the same<br>\
xx. 1 and 2, مَا أَنْزَلْنَا عَلَيْكَ القُرْآنَ لِتَشْقَى إِلَّا تَذْكِرَةً<br>\
[We have not sent down unto thee the Kur-án<br>\
that thou shouldest suffer fatigue, but as an<br>\
admonition]; (Bd, Jel;) or it is here syn. with<br>\
بَلْ [which in this case means the same as لكنّ]:<br>\
(S:) so, too, when the sentence resembles a<br>\
negative, being prohibitive or interrogative; (I&#39; Ak<br>\
p. 163, explained in p. 162;) [thus, لَا تَضْرِبِ القَوْمَ<br>\
إِلَّا حِمَارًا means Beat not thou the people, but an<br>\
ass; and] فَلَولَا كَانَتْ قَرْيَةٌ آمَنَتْ فَنَفَعَهَا إِيمَانُهَا إِلَّا<br>\
قَوْمَ يُونُسَ [in the Kur x. 98] means And wherefore did not any inhabitants of a town believe,<br>\
before the punishment befell them, and their<br>\
belief profit them, but the people of Jonas? for<br>\
these were different from the former. (T.) When<br>\
إِلَّا is repeated for the purpose of corroboration, it<br>\
has no effect upon what follows it, except that of<br>\
corroborating the first exception; as in مَا مَرَرْتُ<br>\
بِأَحَدٍ إَلَّا زَيْدٍ إِلَّا أَخِيكَ [I passed not by any one,<br>\
except Zeyd, except thy brother], in which اخيك<br>\
is a substitute for زيد, for it is as though you said,<br>\
مَا مَرَرْتُ بِأَحَدٍ إِلَّا زَيْدٍ أَخِيكَ; and as in قَامَ القَوْمُ<br>\
إِلَّا زَيْدًا وَ إِلَّا عَمْرًا [The people stood, except Zeyd,<br>\
and except&#39; Amr], originally إِلَّا زَيْدًا وَ عَمْرًا. When<br>\
the repetition is not for that purpose, if the sentence is devoid of the mention of that from which<br>\
the exception is made, you make the governing<br>\
word [which is the verb] to affect one, whichever<br>\
you please, of the nouns signifying the things<br>\
excepted, and put the others in the accus. case,<br>\
so that you say, مَا قَامَ إِلَّا زَيْدٌ إِلَّا عَمْرًا إِلَّا بَكْرًا<br>\
[There stood not any, save Zeyd, save&#39; Amr, save<br>\
Bekr]; but if the sentence is not devoid of the<br>\
mention of that from which the exception is made,<br>\
different rules are observed accord. as the things<br>\
excepted are mentioned before that from which<br>\
the exception is made or after it: in the former<br>\
case, all must be put in the accus., whether the<br>\
sentence be affirmative or not affirmative; as in<br>\
قَامَ إِلَّا زَيْدًا إِلَّا عَمْرًا إِلَّا بَكْرًا القَوْمُ [Except Zeyd,<br>\
except&#39; Amr, except Bekr, the people stood], and<br>\
مَاقَامَ إِلَّا زَيْدًا إِلَّا عَمْرًا إِلَّا بَكْرًا القَوْمُ [Except Zeyd,<br>\
except&#39; Amr, except Bekr, the people stood not]:<br>\
in the latter case, when the sentence is affirmative,<br>\
all must likewise be put in the accus., so that you<br>\
say, قَامَ القَوْمُ إِلَّا زَيْدًا إِلَّا عَمْرًا إِلَّا بَكْرًا [The people<br>\
stood, except Zeyd, except&#39; Amr, except Bekr];<br>\
but when the sentence is not affirmative, the same<br>\
rule is observed with respect to one of them as<br>\
when the exception is not repeated, accord. to the<br>\
usage generally preferred, or it may be put in the<br>\
accus., which is rarely done, and the rest must be<br>\
put in the accus., so that you say, مَا قَامَ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا<br>\
زَيْدٌ إِلَّا عَمْرًا إِلَّا بَكْرًا [There stood not any one,<br>\
except Zeyd, except&#39; Amr, except Bekr, accord.<br>\
to the more approved usage], زيد being a substitute for احد, or you may make the other<br>\
nouns which remain to be substitutes. (I&#39; Ak<br>\
pp. 164 — 166.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Secondly, (Mughnee,) it is<br>\
used as a qualificative, (S, Msb, Mughnee, K,)<br>\
in the manner of غَيْرُ, (Mughnee, K,) [i. e.]<br>\
in the place of غَيْرُ, (S,) [i. e.] as syn. with غَيْرُ,<br>\
(T, Msb,) and سِوَى; (T;) [both meaning the<br>\
same, i. e. Other than; or not, as used before a<br>\
subst. or an adjective;] but its primary application<br>\
is to denote exception, and its use as a qualificative<br>\
is adventitious; whereas the primary application<br>\
of غَيْرُ is as a qualificative, and its use to denote<br>\
exception is adventitious. (S.) It [generally]<br>\
follows an indeterminate, unrestricted pl.; (Msb;)<br>\
or an indeterminate pl., or the like thereof, is<br>\
qualified by it and by that which follows it;<br>\
(Mughnee, K;) the noun which follows it being<br>\
put in the same case as that which precedes it.<br>\
(S.) The following is an ex. of the indeterminate<br>\
pl.: (Mughnee, K:) لَوْ كَانَ فِيهِمَا آلِهَةٌ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ<br>\
لَفَسَدَتَا [If there had been in them (namely the<br>\
heavens and the earth) deities other than God, or<br>\
not God, assuredly they would have become in a<br>\
state of disorder, or ruin; occurring in the Kur<br>\
xxi. 22]; (Fr, T, S, Msb, Mughnee, K;) الّا here<br>\
meaning سَوِى, (Fr, T,) or غَيْرُ, (Msb, TA,) and<br>\
الّا اللّه being a qualificative of آلهة. (TA.) And<br>\
the following is an ex. of the like of an indeterminate pl.:<br>\
أُنِيخَتْ فَأَلْقَتْ بَلْدَةً فَوْقِ بَلْدَةٍ<br>\
قَلِيلٍ بِهَا الأَصْوَاتُ إِلَّا بُغَامُهَا<br>\
[She (the camel) was made to lie down, and threw<br>\
her breast upon a tract of ground in which were<br>\
few sounds other than her broken yearning cry<br>\
for her young one]; for the determination of<br>\
الاصوات [by the article ال] is generical: (Mughnee, K:) this verse is by Dhu-r-Rummeh. (S in<br>\
art. بلد.) The following is an ex. of the like of a<br>\
pl..: (Mughnee:) it is by Lebeed: (T:)<br>\
لَوْ كَانَ غَيْرِى سُلَيْمَى اليَوْمَ غَيَّرَهُ<br>\
وَقْعُ الحَوَادِثِ إِلَّا الصَّارِمُ الذَّكَرُ<br>\
[If it had been other than I, (O) Suleymà, today, the befalling of misfortunes would have<br>\
altered him; other than the sharp sword diversified<br>\
with wavy marks or streaks or grain, or of which<br>\
the edge is of steel and the middle of the broad<br>\
side of soft iron]. (T, Mughnee. [But in the<br>\
latter, in the place of اليَوْمَ, I find الدَّهْرَ, i. e.<br>\
ever.]) What Sb says necessarily implies its not<br>\
being a condition that the word qualified must be<br>\
a pl. or the like thereof; for he gives as an ex.,<br>\
لَوْ كَانَ مَعَنَا رَجُلٌ إِلَّ [If there had been<br>\
with us a man other than Zeyd, we should have<br>\
been overcome]. (Mughnee.) Another ex. of the<br>\
same usage of إِلَّا is the following: جَآءَنِى القَوْمُ إِلَّا<br>\
زَيْدٌ [The people came to me, others than Zeyd, or<br>\
not Zeyd]. (S.) [And مَ أَنْتُمْ إِلَّا بَشَرٌ مِثْلُنَا Ye<br>\
are no other than human beings like us. (Kur<br>\
xxxvi. 14.)] And the saying [in the Kur xliv. 56],<br>\
لَا يَذُقُونَ فِيهَا الْمَوْتَ إِلَّا المَوْتَةَ الْأُولَى [They shall<br>\
not taste therein death, other than the first death];<br>\
الّا here meaning سِوَى: (T:) or, accord. to some,<br>\
it here means بَعْدَ [after]. (Jel.) And the saying<br>\
of &#39;Amr Ibn-Maadee-kerib,<br>\
وَ كُلُّ أَخٍ مُفَارِقُهُ أَخُوهُ<br>\
لَعَمْرُ أَبِيكَ إِلَا الفَرْقَدَانِ<br>\
[And every brother, his brother forsakes him, or<br>\
separates himself from him, by the life of thy<br>\
father, other than the Farhadán; which is the<br>\
name of the two stars b and r of Ursa Minor];<br>\
as though he said غَيْرُ الفَرْقَدَيْنِ: (S:) but Ibn-El-Hájib regards this instance as a deviation from<br>\
a general rule; for he makes it a condition of the<br>\
use of الّا as a qualificative that it must be impossible to use it for the purpose of denoting exception: (Mughnee:) Fr says that this verse has the<br>\
meaning of a negation, and therefore الّا here<br>\
governs the nom. case; as though the poet said,<br>\
There is not any one but his brother forsakes him,<br>\
except the Farkadán. (T.) When it is used as a<br>\
qualificative, it differs from غَيْرُ inasmuch as that<br>\
the noun qualified by it may not be suppressed;<br>\
so that one may not say, جَآءَنِى إِلَّا زَيْدٌ [meaning<br>\
There came to me not Zeyd]; whereas one says,<br>\
جَآئَنِى غَيْرُ زَيْدٍ: and, accord. to some, in this also;<br>\
that it may not be used as such unless it may be used<br>\
to denote exception; so that one may say, عِنْدِى<br>\
دِرْهَمٌ إِلَّا دَانِقٌ [I have a dirhem, not a dánik],<br>\
because one may say إِلَّا دَانِقًا [except a dánik];<br>\
but not إِلَّا جَيِّدٌ [not a good one], because one<br>\
may not say إِلَّا جَيِّدًا [except a good one]; but<br>\
it may be said that this is at variance with what<br>\
they assert respecting the phrase لَوْ كَانَ فِيهِمَا آلِهَةٌ,<br>\
and with the ex. given by Sb, and with the saying<br>\
of Ibn-El-Hájib mentioned above. (Mughnee.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Thirdly, (Mughnee,) sometimes, (S, Msb,) it<br>\
is used as a conjunction, (Mughnee, K,) in the<br>\
manner of وَ (S, Mughnee, K,) consociating both<br>\
literally and as to the meaning, as mentioned by<br>\
Akh and Fr and AO, (Mughnee,) [i. e.] as syn.<br>\
with وَ [And]. (Msb.) Thus in the saying,<br>\
لِئَلاَّ يَكُونَ لِلنَّاسِ عَلَيْكُمْ حُجَةٌ إِلَّا الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا<br>\
[That there may not be to men, against you, any<br>\
allegation, and (meaning nor) to those who have<br>\
acted wrongfully]; (Msb, Mughnee, K;) occurring<br>\
in the Kur [ii. 145]; (Msb;) so accord. to Akh<br>\
and Fr and AO; (Mughnee;) i. e., and those<br>\
who have acted wrongfully also, to them there<br>\
shall not be, against you, any allegation: (Msb:)<br>\
Fr explains it as meaning that the wrongdoer has<br>\
no allegation of which account should be taken;<br>\
and this is correct, and is the opinion held by Zj.<br>\
(T.) Thus, too, in the saying [in the Kur xxvii.<br>\
10 and 11], لَا يَخَافُ لَدَىَّ الْمُرْسَلُونَ إِلَّا مَنْ ظَلَمَ<br>\
ثُمَّ بَدَلَ حُسْنًا بَعْدَ سُوءٍ [The apostles shall not fear<br>\
in my presence, and neither shall he who hath<br>\
acted wrongfully, then hath done good instead,<br>\
after evil; as some explain it; but others say<br>\
that وَلَا مَنْ ظَلَمَ here denotes exception]. (Mughnee, in<br>\
which it is explained as meaning ; and<br>\
K.) And thus in the saying of the poet, [namely,<br>\
El-Mukhabbal Es-Saadee, (S in art. خلد,)]<br>\
وَأَرَى لَهَا دَارًا بِأَغْدِرَة السْ??<br>\
سِيدَانِ لَمْ يَدْرُسْ لَهَا رَسْمُ<br>\
إِلَّا رَمَادًا هَامِدًا دَفَعَتْ<br>\
عَنْهُ الرِّيَاحَ خَوَالِدٌ سُحْمٌ<br>\
[And I see a dwelling formerly belonging to her,<br>\
at the pools of Es-Seedán, (a hill so called,) the<br>\
remains of which have not become effaced, and<br>\
ashes wasted and compacted together, from which<br>\
three black pieces of stone whereon the cooking-pot<br>\
was wont to be placed turned back the winds]:<br>\
he means, أَرَى لَهَا دَارًا وَ رَمَادًا. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Fourthly,<br>\
(Mughnee,) it is redundant, as in the following<br>\
verse, (S in art. فك, Mughnee, K,) of Dhu-rRummeh, (S ubi suprà, Mughnee,) accord. to As<br>\
and IJ: (Mughnee:)<br>\
حَرَاجِيجُ مَا تَنْفَكُّ إِلَّا مُنَاخَةٌ<br>\
عَلَى الخَسْفِ أَوْ نَرْمِى بِهَا بَلَدًا قَفْرَا<br>\
[She-camels long-bodied, or lean, (but other meanings are assigned to the word which I thus<br>\
render,) that cease not to be made to lie down<br>\
in a state of hunger, or with which we direct<br>\
our course to a desert region]; (S ubi suprà,<br>\
Mughnee; [but in one copy of the former, in<br>\
the place of نَرْمِى, I find يَرْمِى; and in my copy<br>\
of the latter, تَرْمِى;]) meaning, ما تنفكّ مناخةً:<br>\
(S ubi suprà:) but it is said that this is a mistake<br>\
of the poet: (Mughnee:) so says Aboo-&#39;Amr<br>\
Ibn-El-&#39;Alà; for, he says, الّا is not to be introduced after تَنْفَكُّ and تَزَالُ: (TA:) and some<br>\
say that the right reading is إِلًّا, with tenween,<br>\
[perhaps a mistranscription, for آلًا,] meaning<br>\
شَخْصًا [in a pl. sense]: and some, that تنفكّ<br>\
is a complete [or an attributive] verb, and مناخة<br>\
is a denotative of state; [consequently, that إِلَّا<br>\
is a compound of إِنْ and لَا, as in some other<br>\
instances hereafter to be mentioned;] the meaning<br>\
being, that are not disengaged, or not free, from<br>\
fatigue [unless when made to lie down]. (Mughnee.) The following is also given as an ex. of<br>\
the same kind:<br>\
أَرَى الدَّهْرَ إِلَّا مَنْجَنُونًا بِأَهْلِهِ<br>\
[I see fortune, or time, to be like a water-wheel,<br>\
with its people]: but the reading which is remembered to have been heard is وَمَا الدَّهْرُ: and if<br>\
the former be correct, it may be explained on<br>\
the supposition that ارى is the complement of<br>\
an oath meant to be understood, and that لا is<br>\
suppressed, as in [the saying in the Kur xii. 85,]<br>\
تَاللّٰهِ تَفْتَأُ تَذْكُرُ يُوسُفَ; [so that the meaning is,<br>\
I see not fortune, or time, to be aught save a<br>\
water-wheel, with its people;] the form of the<br>\
exceptive sentence which is devoid of the mention<br>\
of that from which the exception is made indicating such an explanation. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
[Fifthly,] it occurs as syn. with لضَا [as a particle<br>\
denoting exception, equivalent to our But;<br>\
meaning both except and (after an oath or the like)<br>\
only, or nothing more than]; as in the saying<br>\
in the Kur [xxxviii. 13], إِنْ كُلٌّ إِلَّا كَذَّبَ الرُّسُلَ<br>\
[There was not any one but such as accused the<br>\
apostles of lying], in which &#39;Abd-Allah reads,<br>\
in its place, لَمَّا; and for كُلٌّ he reads كُلُّهُمْ;<br>\
and as in the saying, أَسْأَلُكَ بِاللّٰهِ إِلَّا أَعْطَيْتَنِى [I<br>\
ask, or beg, or beseech, thee by God but that<br>\
thou give me; i. e., I do not ask of thee anything save thy giving me; the preterite here,<br>\
as in many instances in which it is preceded by<br>\
لَمَّا (q. v.), not being a preterite in meaning];<br>\
for which one says also لَمَّا اعطيتنى. (T.)<br>\
-A2-  It<br>\
is also a particle [or rather a compound of two<br>\
words] denoting the complement of a condition;<br>\
originally إِنْ لَا, which form a compound that<br>\
does not admit of [the pronunciation termed]<br>\
imáleh, because إِنْ and لَا are particles. (T.)<br>\
[It signifies, lit., If not.] It is followed by a<br>\
fut., which it renders mejzoom; [and in this<br>\
case it may be rendered as above, or by unless;]<br>\
as in the saying in the Kur [viii. 74], إِلَا تَفْعَلُوهُ<br>\
تَكُنْ فِتْنَةٌ فِى الأَرْضِ [If ye do it not, or unless ye<br>\
do it, there will be a weakness of faith and an<br>\
appearing of unbelief in the earth]. (T.) [In<br>\
like manner,] in a saying such as the following, [in<br>\
the Kur ix. 40,] إِلَّا تَنْصُرُوهُ فَقَدْ نَصَرَهُ اللّٰهُ [If ye<br>\
do not, or will not, aid him, certainly God aided<br>\
him], it is only a compound of two words, the<br>\
conditional إِنْ and the negative لَا, and is distinct<br>\
from إِلَّا of which the usages have been mentioned<br>\
before, though Ibn-Málik has included it therewith. (Mughnee.) [Often in post-classical works,<br>\
and perhaps in classical also, but seldom except<br>\
when it is preceded by a condition with its complement, the verb or verbal proposition which<br>\
should immediately follow it is suppressed; as<br>\
in the like of the saying, إِنْ فَعَلْتَ كَذَا عَفَوْتُ<br>\
عَنْكَ وَ إِلَّا قَتَلْتُكَ If thou do such a thing, I forgive<br>\
thee, or cancel thine offence; but if thou wilt not<br>\
do it (i. e., إِلَّا تَفْعَلْهُ,) I kill thee: sometimes<br>\
also it ends a sentence, by an aposiopesis; the<br>\
whole of what should follow it being suppressed:<br>\
and sometimes the complement of the condition<br>\
which precedes, as well as the verb or verbal<br>\
proposition which should immediately follow it,<br>\
is suppressed; so that you say, إِنْ فَعَلْتُ كَذَا<br>\
وَ إِلَّا قَتَلْتُكَ If thou do such a thing, excellent<br>\
will it be, or the like, فَنِعِمَّا هُوَ, or the like,<br>\
being understood,) but if not, I kill thee.<br>\
Hence,] it sometimes has the meaning of إِمَّا,<br>\
[signifying Or, denoting an alternative, corresponding to a preceding إِمَّا, which signifies<br>\
“either,”] as in the saying, إِمَّا أَنْ تُكَلِّمَنِى وَ إِلَّا<br>\
فَاسْكُتْ [Either do thou speak to me or else<br>\
(meaning وَ إِلَّا تُكَلِّمَنِى or if thou wilt not speak<br>\
to me) be silent], i. e., وَ إِمَّا أَنْ تَسْكُتَ. (S.) [It<br>\
is also followed by أَنْ, as in إِلَّا أَنْ يَشَآءَ اللّٰهُ Unless<br>\
God should please; in the Kur vi. 111, &amp;c.<br>\
And by و as a denotative of state, as in لَا تَمُوتُنَّ<br>\
إِلَّا وَ أَنْتُمْ مُسْلِمُونَ Do not ye die unless ye be<br>\
Muslims; in the Kur ii. 126 and iii. 97. And<br>\
sometimes it is preceded by اَللّهُمَّ; for the effect<br>\
of which, in this case, see art. اله.]<br>\
