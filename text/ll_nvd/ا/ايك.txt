أَيِكَ الأَرَاكُ, aor.<br>\
اَيَكَ, The [trees called] اراك<br>\
became what is termed أَيْكَة [n. un. of أَيْكٌ, q. v.];<br>\
as also ↓ استأيك. (K.) The former occurs in<br>\
poetry contracted into أَيْكَ. (ISd, Sgh.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَاْيَكَ see 1.<br>\
أَيْكٌ Numerous, luxuriant or tangled or dense,<br>\
trees: (S, K:) or a place where water collects<br>\
and sinks into the ground (غَيْضَةٌ) producing<br>\
[trees of the kinds called] سِدْر and أَرَاك (Lth, K)<br>\
and similar soft trees: (Lth:) or a collection of<br>\
any trees; even, of palm-trees: (K:) or, as some<br>\
say, a place where [trees of the kind called] أَثْل<br>\
grow, and where is a collection of them: or,<br>\
accord. to AHn, an abundant collection of أَرَاك<br>\
in one place: (TA:) or trees; said to be of the<br>\
[kind called] أَرَاك: (Msb:) n. un. with ة: (S,<br>\
Msb, K, &amp;c.:) IAar says, [you say,] أَيْكَةٌ<br>\
أَثْلٍ and رَهْطٌ, and قَصِيمَةٌ. (Sh.)<br>\
أَصْحَابُ الْأَيْكَةِ occurs in the Kur in four chapters:<br>\
[xv. 78 and xxvi. 176 and xxxviii. 12 and 1.13:]<br>\
(Sgh:) he who reads thus means, by the latter<br>\
word, الغَيْضَة [explained above, and also signifying the thicket, or collection of tangled trees,<br>\
&amp;c.]; (S, K;) or the tangled, or luxuriant, or<br>\
abundant and dense, trees: (TA:) another reading is لَيْكَةَ; accord. to which, this is the name<br>\
of the town [in which the people here mentioned<br>\
dwelt]: (S, K:) or, as some say, the two words<br>\
are [applied to the same place,] like بَكَّةُ and مَكَّةُ:<br>\
(S:) but Zj says that another reading is allowable, and very good; i. e. أَصْحَابُ لَيْكَةِ, as being<br>\
originally الأيْكَةِ; for the Arabs say, اَلَحْمَرُ قَدْ<br>\
جَآءَنِى and لَحْمَرُ جَآإَنِى for الأَحْمَرُ; so that لَيْكَة<br>\
is like لَحْمَر. (TA.)<br>\
أَيْكٌ أَيِكٌ, (K, TA,) like كَتِفْ, (TA, [agreeably<br>\
with the verb, but in the CK اٰيِكٌ,]) is a phrase<br>\
in which the latter word signifies مُثْمِرٌ [Putting<br>\
forth fruit; &amp;c.]: (K, TA:) or, as some say,<br>\
it is an intensive epithet [signifying very abundant<br>\
or luxuriant or tangled &amp;c.]. (M, TA.)<br>\
