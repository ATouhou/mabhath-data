is the n. un. of the former, [which is a coll. gen.<br>\
n.,] (Msb,) i. q. بَطٌّ [The goose, or geese; and the<br>\
duck, or ducks; but اوزّ is generally applied to the<br>\
former of these birds; and بطّ, to the latter;<br>\
agreeably with a statement in the Jm, that بَطٌّ is<br>\
applied by the Arabs to the small, and إِوَزٌّ to the<br>\
large]; (S, K;) as also وَزٌّ, of which the n. un. is<br>\
وَزَّةٌ: (Msb:) إِوَزٌّ is of the measure فِعَلٌّ: (Msb:)<br>\
[but see what follows:] the pl. is إِوَزُّونَ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) a form which is sometimes used, (S, Msb,)<br>\
and which is anomalous. (Msb.) [See also<br>\
كُرْكِىٌّ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] إِوَزٌّ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  Short<br>\
and thick: (K:) fleshy without being tall: (Lth,<br>\
TA:) fem. with ة. (TA.) El-&#39;Okberee asserts<br>\
that the أ is augmentative, because it is followed<br>\
by three radical letters: (MF, TA:) but ISd says<br>\
that it is of the measure فِعَلٌّ, and may not be of<br>\
the measure إِفْعَلٌ, [i. e., originally إِوْزَزٌ,] because<br>\
this does not occur as the measure of an epithet.<br>\
(TA.) [It seems, however, that اوزّ is in this case<br>\
a subst. used tropically as an epithet, after the<br>\
manner of many nicknames.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, applied to<br>\
a man, and to a horse, and to a camel, Firm in<br>\
make: (AHei in the Expos. of the Tes-heel, and<br>\
TA:) or, applied to a horse, compact and strong<br>\
in make. (TA.)<br>\
إِوَزَّي A manner of walking in which is a moving<br>\
up and down: or leaning on one side; (K;) [the<br>\
latter omitted in the CK;] at one time on the<br>\
right and at another on the left [like a goose or<br>\
duck]: (TA:) and the walk of a sprightly horse.<br>\
(TA.) Az says that it may be of the measure<br>\
إِفْعَلَى, [i. e., originally إِوْزَزَّى,] or فِعَلَّى; but<br>\
Abu-l-Hasan holds the latter to be the more correct, because it is the measure of many words<br>\
relating to walking; as جِيَضَّى, and دِفَقَّى. (TA.)<br>\
أَضٌ مَأْوَزَةٌ A land abounding with the birds<br>\
called إِوَزّ. (Sgh, K.)<br>\
