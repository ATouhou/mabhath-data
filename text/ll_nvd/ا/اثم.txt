أَثِمَ, (Lth, S, M, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
اَثَمَ, (Lth, M, Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. إِثْمٌ, (S, K,) or أَثَمٌ, the former being a<br>\
simple subst., (Msb,) and مَأْثَمٌ, (S, K,) He fell<br>\
into what is termed إِثْمٌ [i. e. a sin, or crime, &amp;c.];<br>\
(Lth, T, S, M, Msb, * K *;) [he sinned; committed<br>\
a sin, or crime;] he did what was unlawful:<br>\
(M, * K:) and ↓ تَأْثِيمٌ signifies the same as إِثْمٌ:<br>\
(K:) it may be either an inf. n. of ↓ أَثَمَ, which<br>\
[says ISd] I have not heard, or, as Sb holds it to<br>\
be, a simple subst. like تَنْبِيتٌ: (M:) and is said<br>\
to be used in the sense of إِثْم in the Kur lii. 23<br>\
[and lvi. 24]. (TA.) [It should be added also,<br>\
that ↓ تأْثَامٌ, like تَكْذَابٌ, is syn. with تأْثِيمٌ and<br>\
إِثْمٌ; and, like تأثيم, may be an inf. n. of ↓ أَثَّمَ, or<br>\
a simple subst.: see an ex. voce بَرُوقٌ.] In the<br>\
dial. of some of the Arabs, the first letter of the<br>\
aor. is with kesr, as in تِعْلَمُ and نِعْلَمُ; and as the<br>\
hemzeh in إِثْمٌ is with kesr, the radical hemzeh [in<br>\
the aor.] is changed into ى; so that they say<br>\
إِيثَمُ and تِيثَمُ [for آثَمُ and تَأْثَمُ.] (TA.) In the saying,<br>\
لَوْ قُلْتَ مَا فِى قَوْمَهَا لَمْ تِيثَمِ<br>\
يَفْضُلَهَا فِى حَسَبٍ وَمِيسَمِ<br>\
the meaning is, [Shouldst thou say, thou wouldst<br>\
not sin, or do wrong, in so saying,] There is not,<br>\
among her people, any one who excels her [in<br>\
grounds of pretension to respect, and in impress, or<br>\
character, of beauty]. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  أَثَمَهُ اللّٰهُ فِى كَذَا,<br>\
aor.<br>\
اَثُمَ (S, K) and<br>\
اَثِمَ, (S,) or<br>\
اَثَمَ, (K,) but there<br>\
is no other authority than the K for this last, nor<br>\
is there any reason for it, as the medial radical<br>\
letter is not faucial, nor is the final, and in the<br>\
Iktitáf el-Azáhir the aor. is said to be<br>\
اَثِمَ and<br>\
اَثُمَ,<br>\
(MF, TA,) [God reckoned him to have sinned,<br>\
or committed a crime or the like, in such a thing;<br>\
or] God reckoned such a thing against him as an<br>\
إِثْم: (S, K:) or أَثَمَهُ, aor.<br>\
اَثِمَ (Fr, T, M, Msb)<br>\
and<br>\
اَثُمَ, (Msb,) inf. n. أَثْمٌ (Fr, T, Msb) and أَثَامٌ<br>\
(Fr, T, TA) and إِثَامٌ, (Fr, TA,) He (God) requited him, (Fr, T,) or punished him, (M,) for<br>\
what is termed إِثْمٌ [i. e. sin, or crime, &amp;c.]: (Fr,<br>\
T, M:) [see also أَثَامٌ below:] or he (a man)<br>\
pronounced him to be آثم [i. e. a sinner, or the<br>\
like]: (Msb:) [or] ↓ آثَمَهُ, aor. يَؤْثِمُهُ, has this last<br>\
signification, said of God; and also signifies<br>\
He found him to be so. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also,<br>\
أَثَمَتِ النَّاقَةُ المَشْىَ, aor.<br>\
اَثِمَ, inf. n. أَثْمٌ, The she-camel was slow. (M.)<br>\
2<br>\
أثّمهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَأْثِيمٌ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
He said to him أَثِمْتَ [Thou hast fallen into a sin,<br>\
or crime, &amp;c.; hast sinned, &amp;c.]. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, first and second sentences.<br>\
4<br>\
آثمهُ He made him, or caused him, to fall<br>\
into what is termed إِثْمٌ [i. e. a sin, or crime, &amp;c.],<br>\
(Zj, S, M, K,) or what is termed ذَنْبٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also 1, last sentence but one.<br>\
5<br>\
تأثّم He abstained from what is termed إِثْمٌ<br>\
[i. e. sin, or crime, &amp;c.]; (T, S, M, Msb, K;)<br>\
like تَحَرَّجَ meaning “ he preserved himself from<br>\
what is termed حَرَجٌ: ” (Msb:) or he did a work,<br>\
or deed, whereby he escaped from what is termed<br>\
إِثْمٌ: (TA:) and he repented of what is so termed,<br>\
(M, K,) and begged forgiveness of it; as though<br>\
he removed the إِثْم itself by repentance and by<br>\
begging forgiveness; or sought to do so by those<br>\
two means. (M.) You say also, تأثّم مِنْ كَذَا<br>\
He abstained from such a thing as a sin, or<br>\
crime; syn. تَحَّنَثَ, q. v. (S, K, in art. حنث.)<br>\
إِثْمٌ [accord. to some, an inf. n.; see أَثِمَ: accord.<br>\
to others, only a simple subst., signifying] A sin,<br>\
a crime, a fault, an offence, or an act of disobedience, syn. ذَنْبٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) for which<br>\
one deserves punishment; differing from ذَنْبٌ<br>\
inasmuch as this signifies both what is intentional<br>\
and what is unintentional: (Kull:) or [so accord.<br>\
to the M, but in the K “ and,”] an unlawful deed:<br>\
(M, K:) or a deed which retards from recompense:<br>\
or, accord. to Fr, what is exclusive of the [punishment termed] حَدّ: accord. to Er-Rághib, it is a<br>\
term of more general import than عُدَوانٌ: (TA:)<br>\
↓ مَأْثَمٌ [which is originally an inf. n. of أَثِمَ] is<br>\
syn. with إِثْمٌ; (T, * Mgh;) and so, too, is ↓ أَثَامٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) or ↓ إِثَامٌ, signifying a deed retarding<br>\
recompense: (TA:) the pl. of إِثْمٌ is آثَامٌ: (M:)<br>\
and the pl. of ↓ مَأْثَمٌ is مَآثِمُ. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Sometimes<br>\
it is prefixed to a noun or pronoun denoting its<br>\
object: ―<br>\
-b3-  and sometimes it means (assumed tropical:)  The punishment of a sin &amp;c.: see explanations of a passage<br>\
in the Kur v. 32, voce بَآءَ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  Wine: (Aboo-Bekr El-Iyádee, T, S, M, K:) sometimes used in<br>\
this sense; (S;) but tropically; not properly:<br>\
(IAmb:) I think, [says ISd,] because the drinking<br>\
thereof is what is thus termed. (M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [And for<br>\
a like reason,] (assumed tropical:)  Contention for stakes, or wagers,<br>\
in a game of hazard; syn. قِمَارٌ; (M, K;) which<br>\
is a man&#39;s destruction of his property. (M.) It<br>\
is said in the Kur [ii. 216, respecting wine and<br>\
the game called المَيْسِر], قُلْ فِهِيمَا إِثْمٌ كَبِيرٌ وَ مَنَافِعُ<br>\
لِلنَّاسِ [Say thou, In them both are great sin and<br>\
means of profit to men]: and Th says, when they<br>\
contended in a game of this kind, and won, they<br>\
gave food and alms, and these were means of<br>\
profit. (M.)<br>\
أَثَامٌ: see إِثْمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The requital, or recompense, of إِثّم [i. e. sin, or crime, &amp;c.]: (T, S, M,<br>\
Msb:) so says Zj, (T, M,) and in like manner<br>\
say Kh and Sb: (T:) or punishment (Yoo, Lth,<br>\
T, M, K) thereof: (Lth, T, M:) and ↓ إِثَامٌ and<br>\
↓ مَأْثَمٌ signify the same; (M, K;) the latter like<br>\
مَقْعَدٌ. (TA. [In the CK this is written مَأثِم.])<br>\
So in the Kur [xxv. 68], يَلْقَ أَثَامَا [He shall find<br>\
a requital, or recompense, or a punishment, of sin]:<br>\
(T, S, M:) in my opinion, [says ISd,] the correct<br>\
meaning is, he shall find the punishment of آثَام<br>\
[or sins]: but some say, the meaning is that which<br>\
here follows. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A valley in Hell. (M, K.)<br>\
إِثَامٌ: see إِثْمٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and أَثَامٌ.<br>\
أَثُومَّ: see آثِمٌ; and أَثِيمٌ.<br>\
أَثِيمٌ: see آثِمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A great, or habitual, liar;<br>\
or one who lies much; and so ↓ أَثُومٌ. (K.) So<br>\
in the Kur ii. 277: or it there signifies Burdened<br>\
with إثْم [or sin, &amp;c.]. (TA.) In the Kur xliv. 44,<br>\
it means, accord. to Fr, The unrighteous, or<br>\
sinning; like ↓ آثِمٌ: (T:) or the unbeliever:<br>\
(TA:) or, accord. to Zj, in this instance, (M,) by<br>\
the اثيم is meant Aboo-Jahl. (M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
The commission of إِثْم [sin, or crime, &amp;c.,] much,<br>\
or frequently; and so ↓ أَثِيمَةٌ. (M, K.)<br>\
أَثِيمَةٌ: see أَثِيمٌ.<br>\
أَثَامٌ: see آثِمٌ.<br>\
آثِمٌ Falling into what is termed إِثمٌ [i. e. a sin,<br>\
or crime, &amp;c.]; (S, Msb, * K; *) [sinning; committing a sin, or crime;] doing what is unlawful:<br>\
(K:) and in like manner, (S, Msb, K,) but having<br>\
an intensive signification, (Msb,) ↓ أَثِيمٌ, and<br>\
↓ أَثُومٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) and ↓ أَثَّامٌ: (M, Msb, K:<br>\
[in the CK, erroneously, without teshdeed:]) the<br>\
pl. of the first of these three is أُثَمَآءُ; that of the<br>\
second, أُثُمٌ; and that of the third, أَثَّامُونَ. (M.)<br>\
See also أَثِيمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  آثِمَةٌ, (S,) and آثِمَاتٌ, (S, M, K,<br>\
[in the CK, erroneously, اَثِماتٌ.]) A she-camel,<br>\
(S,) and she-camels, slow, or tardy; (S, M, K;)<br>\
weary, fatigued, or jaded. (K. [In the CK, we<br>\
find مُعِيْباتٌ erroneously put for مُعْيِيَاتٌ.]) Some<br>\
pronounce it with ت. (Sgh.) [In like manner,]<br>\
↓ مُؤَاثِمٌ signifies That is slack, or slow, in pace, or<br>\
going; اَلَّذِى يَكْذِبُ فِى السَّيْرِ. (Sgh, K. [In Golius&#39;s Lex., as from the K, اَلَّذِى يُكَذِّبُ السَّيْرَ.<br>\
Both are correct, signifying the same.])<br>\
تَأْثَامٌ: see 1.<br>\
تَأْثِيمٌ: see 1.<br>\
مَأْثَمٌ: see إِثْمٌ, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see أَثَامٌ.<br>\
مَأْثُومٌ [Reckoned to have sinned, or the like;]<br>\
having a thing reckoned against him as an إِثْم:<br>\
(S:) or requited for what is termed إِثْمٌ. (Fr, T.)<br>\
مُوَاثِمٌ: see آثِمٌ.<br>\
