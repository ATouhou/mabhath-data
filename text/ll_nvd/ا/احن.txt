(Msb, K,) inf. n. أَحَنٌ, (Msb,) or أَحْنٌ, and إِحْنَةٌ,<br>\
(TA,) or this last is a simple subst.; (Msb;) and<br>\
أَحَنَ عَلَيْهِ, aor.<br>\
اَحَنَ, inf. n. أَحْنٌ; (Kr, TA;) He<br>\
retained enmity against him in his bosom, watching<br>\
for an opportunity to indulge it, or exercise it;<br>\
or hid enmity against him in his bosom; or bore<br>\
rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite, against<br>\
him: (S, Msb, K: *) and he was affected with<br>\
anger (K, TA) against him, such as came upon<br>\
him suddenly from the retention or hiding of<br>\
enmity in the bosom, or from rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite. (TA.)<br>\

آحَنَهُ, (TA,) inf. n. مُؤَاحَنَةٌ, (S, K,) He<br>\
treated him, or regarded him, with enmity, or<br>\
hostility. (S, * K, * TA.)<br>\
إِحْنَةٌ Retention of enmity in the bosom, with<br>\
watchfulness for an opportunity to indulge it,<br>\
or exercise it; or concealment of enmity in the<br>\
bosom; or rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) and anger (K, TA) coming upon<br>\
one suddenly therefrom: (TA:) pl. إِحَنٌ. (S,<br>\
Msb, K.) It is said in the S that one should<br>\
not say حِنَةٌ; and this is disallowed by As and<br>\
Fr and Ibn-El-Faraj: in the T it is said that it is<br>\
not of the language of the Arabs; and As is<br>\
related to have disapproved of Et-Tirimmáh for<br>\
using its pl. in poetry: but it is said in a trad.,<br>\
مَا بَيْنِى وبَيْنَ العَرَبِ حِنَةٌ [There is not between<br>\
me and the Arabs retention of enmity in the<br>\
bosom, &amp;c.]; and it occurs in another trad., in<br>\
a similar phrase; and the pl., in a third trad.;<br>\
therefore we say that it is a dial. var. of rare<br>\
occurrence. (TA.)<br>\
