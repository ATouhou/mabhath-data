tanned, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) so that it is unsubstantial, not firm, or strong, or tough: (Mgh:)<br>\

it is termed أَدِيم: therefore أَفِيقٌ is of the measure<br>\
فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (Msb:)<br>\

think that Th has mentioned ↓ أَفِقٌ as syn. with<br>\
أَفِيقٌ, and explained it as signifying the skin, or<br>\
hide, that is not tanned; but I am not sure of it:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. is أَفَقٌ, (Lh, JK, S, Msb, K,) like<br>\
as أَدَمٌ is pl. of أَدِيمٌ, (S,) or this is a quasi-pl. n.,<br>\
(M, K,) and أُفُقٌ (JK, K) is allowable, (JK,) or,<br>\
accord. to Lh, it is not allowable, (TA,) and [pl.<br>\
of pauc.] آفِقَةٌ, (As, S, K,) like as آدمَةٌ and أَرْغِفَةٌ<br>\
are pls. of أَدِيمٌ and رَغِيفٌ. (As, S.) ↓ أَفِيقَةٌ signifies also A سِقَآء [or skin for water or milk &amp;c.]<br>\

TA, [in the CK اَفِقٌ, and in like manner in a<br>\
copy of the JK,]) from أَفِقَ, (S, K,) or, as IB<br>\
says, accord. to Kz, from أَفَقَ, aor.<br>\
اَفِقَ, and so<br>\
accord. to Kr, and shown to be of the measure<br>\
فَاعِلٌ by several verses in which it occurs, (TA,)<br>\

in chasteness of speech, or eloquence, and in the<br>\
