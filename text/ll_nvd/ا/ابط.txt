أَبَطَهُ i. q. هَبَطَهُ, q. v.: (IAar, Az, Sgh, K:)<br>\
said of God. (K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تأبّطهُ He put it (a thing, S Mgh, Msb)<br>\
beneath his إِبْط [or arm-pit]; (S, Msb, K;) or in<br>\
his إِبْط. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (K,) تَأَبَّطَ شَرَّا, the<br>\
surname of Thábit the son of Jábir (S, K) ElFahmee: (S:) because they assert that the sword<br>\
never quitted him: (S:) or because he put beneath his arm—pit a quiver of arrows, and took a<br>\
bow, or put beneath his arm—pit a knife, and came<br>\
to an assembly of Arabs, and smote some of them.<br>\
(K.) It is invariable: but if you desire to express<br>\
the dual or pl., you say, ذَوَا تَأَبَّطَ شَرًّا and ذَوُو تَأَبَّطَ<br>\
شَرٍّا, or you say كِلَاهُمَا and كُلُّهُمْ. (S.) It does<br>\
not admit of the formation of a dim., nor is it<br>\
abridged: (S, K:) but some of the Arabs used<br>\
to say تَأَبَّطُ [so written with refa], using a single<br>\
word, accord. to Sb, as is said in the L. (TA.)<br>\
Its rel. n. is ↓ تَأَبَّطِىٌّ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also]<br>\
تأبّط فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا (assumed tropical:)  Such a one placed such a one<br>\
under his protection. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  تأبّط also signifies<br>\
He put his رِدَآء, (S,) or garment, (Mgh, K,)<br>\
under his right arm, and then threw [a portion<br>\
of] it over his left shoulder, (S, Mgh, K,) in<br>\
prayer, or in إِحْرَام; (Mgh;) as also اِضْطَبَعَ.<br>\
(S.) [See also تَوَشَّحَ.]<br>\
إِبْطٌ [The armpit;] the inner side of the shoulderjoint: (ISd, K:) or the part beneath the جَنَاح<br>\
[which signifies the arm, upper arm, armpit, and<br>\
wing, &amp;c.]: (S, Msb:) also written ↓ إِبِطٌ; (Msb,<br>\
K;) which is said to be a dial. var. by some of<br>\
the moderns; but this is strange, on account of<br>\
what is said respecting إِبِلٌ; (Msb;) for Sb says<br>\
that there are only two substs. of the measure فِعِلٌ,<br>\
which are إِبِلٌ and حِبِرٌ; and one epithet, namely<br>\
بِلِزٌ: other instances have been mentioned, but<br>\
their transmission from Sb is not established:<br>\
(Msb. in art. ابل:) it is also said that there is no<br>\
other word like إِبِلٌ; but this means, in its original form, and does not deny that there are words<br>\
like it by the insertion of a second vowel like the<br>\
first, such as this and many other words: (TA:)<br>\
[see also إِبِدٌ:] it is fem.; (Mgh;) or masc. and<br>\
fem.; (S, Msb;) sometimes the latter; (Lh, K;)<br>\
but the making it mase. is more approved: (TA:)<br>\
Fr cites, from certain of the Arabs, the phrase,<br>\
(S,) فَرَفَعَ السَّوْطَ حَتَّى بَرَقَتْ إِبْطُهُ [And he raised<br>\
the whip so that his armpit shone]: (S, Msb:)<br>\
the pl. is آبَاطٌ. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ضَرَبَ<br>\
آبَاطَ الأُمُورِ وَمَغَابِنَهَا (tropical:)  [He hit the secret and occult<br>\
particulars of the affairs]. (A, TA [followed by<br>\
the words وَ اشْتَقَّ ضَمَائِرَهَا وَبَوَاطِنَهَا, a pleonastic<br>\
addition, merely explaining what goes before.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And ضَرَبَ آبَاطَ المَفَازَةِ (tropical:)  [He traversed the<br>\
recesses of the desert]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And إِبْطُ جَبَلٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The foot, or bottom, or lowest part, (سَفَحْ,) of a<br>\
mountain. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And إِبْطُ رَمْلٍ (assumed tropical:)  The place<br>\
where the main body of sand ends: (S:) or what<br>\
is thin, of sand: (K:) or the lowest part of an<br>\
oblong tract of sand collected together and elevated,<br>\
where the main body thereof ends, and it becomes<br>\
thin. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And إِبعطُ الشِّمَالِ (assumed tropical:)  Evil fortune;<br>\
ill luck. (TA.)<br>\
إِبِطٌ: see إِبْطٌ.<br>\
إِبْطِيٌّ [Of, or relating to, the armpit]. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
الإِبْطِىُّ The axillary vein. (Golius, on the<br>\
authority of Meyd.)<br>\
السَّيْفُ إِبَاطٌ لِى The sword is beneath my أِبْط [or<br>\
armpit]: and السَّيْفُ عِطَا فِى وَ إِبَاطِى I put, or<br>\
place, the sword upon my side, and beneath my<br>\
إِبْط. (TA.) And جَعَلْتُهُ I put it (namely<br>\
the sword, TA) next my إِبْط (K, TA.) The<br>\
Hudhalee, (S, TA,) El-Mutanakhkhil, describing<br>\
water to which he came to drink, (TA,) says,<br>\
(S, TA,) accord. to the Deewán, but some ascribe<br>\
the words to Taäbbata—Sharrà, (TA,)<br>\
شَرِبْتُ بِجَّمِهِ وَصَدَرْتُ عَنْهُ<br>\
وَ أَبْيَضُ صَارِمٌ ذَكَرٌ إِبَاطِى<br>\
meaning [I drank of the main body thereof, and<br>\
returned from it, and a sharp steel—edged sword<br>\
was] beneath my إِبْط: (S, TA:) or, accord. to one<br>\
relation, the poet said, بِأَبْيَضَ صَارِمٍ ذَكَرٍ: and accord.<br>\
to another, وَ عَضْبٌ صَارِمٌ: Skr says that the last<br>\
word of the verse is a contraction of آبَاطِى: and<br>\
Ibn-Es-Seeráfee, that it is originally ↓ إِبَاطِىٌّ; and<br>\
if so, it is an epithet. (TA.)<br>\
إِبَاطِىٌّ: see what next precedes.<br>\
تَأَبَّطِىٌّ: see 5.<br>\
