load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'اماأَمَا, used to denote an interrogation, is a compound of the interrogative hemzeh and the negative مَا: (M:) it is a mere interrogative [respecting a negative, like أَلَا]; as in the saying, أَمَا<br>\
تَسْتَحْيِى مِنَ اللّٰهِ [Art not thou ashamed for thyself, or of thyself, with respect to God?]. (Lth, T.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [IHsh says, after explaining two other usages<br>\
of أَمَا which we have yet to mention,] El-Málakee<br>\
adds a third meaning of أَمَا, saying that it is a particle denoting عَرْضٌ [or the asking, or requiring, a<br>\
thing in a gentle manner], like [أَلَا (q. v.) and]<br>\
لَوْلَا; and is connected peculiarly with a verb;<br>\
as in أَمَا تَقُومُ [Wherefore wilt not thou do stand?],<br>\
and أَمَا تَفْعَلُ [Wherefore wilt not thou do such<br>\
a thing?]; which may be explained by saying<br>\
that the hemzeh is used as an interrogative to<br>\
make one confess, or acknowledge, a thing, as<br>\
it is in أَلَمْ and أَلَا, and that مَا is a negative.<br>\
(Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is also an inceptive word, used<br>\
in the manner of أَلَا: (M:) followed by أَلَا, it<br>\
is syn. with أَلَا: (S:) [meaning Now: or now<br>\
surely: or] both of these meaning verily, or truly;<br>\
i. c. حَقًّا: and for this reason Sb allows one&#39;s<br>\
saying, أَمَا إنَّه مُنْطَلقٌ and أَمَا أَنَّهُ مُنْطَلقٌ [Verily,<br>\
or truly, he is going away]; with kesr after the<br>\
manner of أَلَا إِنَّهُ, and with fet-h after the manner<br>\
of حَقًّا أَنَّهُ: and هَمَا وَاللّٰهِ لَقَدْ كَانَ كَذَا is mentioned as meaning أَمَا وَ اللّٰهِ [&amp;c., i. e. Verily, or<br>\
truly, by God, such a thing did indeed happen];<br>\
the ه being a substitute for the hemzeh: (M:)<br>\
so too حَمَى واللّٰه [or حَمَا واللّٰه]: (Sgh and K<br>\
in art. حمى:) it denotes the truth of the words<br>\
which follow it; as when you say, أَمَا إِنَّ زَيْدًا عَاقِلٌ,<br>\
meaning Truly, or properly speaking, not tropically, Zeyd is intelligent; and أَمَّا و اللّٰه قَد ضَرَبَ<br>\
زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا [Truly, &amp;c., by God, Zeyd beat, or<br>\
struck, Amr]: (S in art. امو:) [in other words,]<br>\
it corroborates an oath and a sentence; as in<br>\
أَمَا وَ اللّٰه لَئِنْ سْهَرْتُ لَكَ لَيْلَةً لَأَ دَعَنَّكَ نَادِمًا [Verily,<br>\
or now surely, by God, if I remain awake for<br>\
thee a night, then will I indeed leave thee repenting]; and أَمَا لَو عَلِمْتُ مَكَانَكَ لَأَزْعَجْتُكَ مِنْهُ [Verily,<br>\
or now surely, if I had known thy place of being,<br>\
then had I unsettled thee, or removed thee, from<br>\
it]; and أَمَا إِنَّهُ لَرَجُلٌ كَرِيمٌ [Verily, or now<br>\
surely, he is (emphatically) a generous man]:<br>\
(T:) or it is an inceptive particle, used in the<br>\
manner of أَلَا; [meaning now: or now surely:]<br>\
(Mughnee:) or a particle used to give notice of<br>\
what is about to be said: only put before a proposition [as in exs. mentioned above]: (TA:)<br>\
and often occurring before an oath [as in exs.<br>\
mentioned above]: and sometimes its hemzeh<br>\
is changed into ه or ع, before the oath; each<br>\
with the ا remaining; [written هَمَا or عَمَا;] and<br>\
with the ا elided; [written هَمَ or عَمَ;] or with<br>\
the ا elided, but without the substitution; [written<br>\
أَمَ;] and when انَّ occurs after أَمَا, it is with<br>\
kesr, as it is after أَلَا: and it also means حَقًّا<br>\
[verily, or truly]: or أَحقًّا [verily? or truly?]:<br>\
accord. to different opinions: and in this case,<br>\
انَّ after it is with fet-h, as it is after حَقَّا: accord.<br>\
to Ibn-Kharoof, this is a particle: but some say<br>\
that it is a noun in the sense of حَقًّا: and others,<br>\
that it consists of two words, namely, the interrogative hemzeh and مَا as a noun in the sense of<br>\
شَىْءٌ; i. e. أَذالِكَ الشَّىْءُ حَقٌّ [is that thing ture?];<br>\
so that the meaning is أَحَقًّا: [if so, أَمَا أَنَّه مُنْطَلقٌ<br>\
means Verily, or truly, is he going away?] and<br>\
this, which is what Sb says, is the correct opinion:<br>\
مَا is virtually in the accus. case, as an adverbial<br>\
noun, like as حَقًّا is literally: and أَنَّ with its<br>\
complement is an inchoative, of which the adverbial noun is the enunciative: but Mbr says that<br>\
حَقًّا is the inf. n. of يَحِقُّ, which is suppressed,<br>\
and that أنَّ with its complement is an agent.<br>\
(Mughnee.)<br>\
أَمَّا is a conditional and partitive and corroborative particle; and is sometimes written أَيْمَا, by<br>\
the change of the first م into ى. (Mughnee, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  It is used as a conditional particle in the<br>\
words of the Kur [ii.24], فأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فَيَعْلَمُونَ<br>\
أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَيَقُولُونَ مَا<br>\
ذَا أَرَادَ اللّٰهُ بِهذَا مَثَلاً [For as for those who have<br>\
believed, they know that it is the truth from their<br>\
Lord; but as for those who have disbelieved, they<br>\
say, What is it that God meaneth by this as a<br>\
parable?]. (Mughnee,* K,* TA.) That it denotes<br>\
a condition is shown by the necessary occurrence<br>\
of ف after it; for if this ف were a conjunction, it<br>\
would not be prefixed to the enunciative; and if<br>\
it were redundant, it might be dispensed with;<br>\
but it may not be dispensed with except in a case<br>\
of necessity in poetry or in a case of an ellipsis.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  In most cases, (Mughnee, K,) it is used as a<br>\
partitive, (S, Mughnee, K,) implying the meaning<br>\
of a condition; (S; [in which it is mentioned with<br>\
أَمَا;]) and thus it is used in the passage of the<br>\
Kur cited above; (Mughnee;) and in the following exs. [in the Kur xviii. 78 and 79 and 81],<br>\
أَمَّا السَّفِينَةُ فَكَانَتْ لِمَسَاكِينَ يَعْمَلُونَ فِى البَحْرِ and<br>\
وَأَمَا الْغُلَامُ فَكَانَ أَبَوَاهُ مُؤْمِنِينَ and وأَمَّا الْجِدَارُ فَكَانَ<br>\
لِغلَامَينِ يَتَيمَيْنِ [As for the ship, it belonged to<br>\
poor men who worked on the sea . . . and as for<br>\
the boy, his two parents were believers . . . and<br>\
as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys].<br>\
(Mughnee, * K, * TA.) [It is a partitive also in<br>\
the phrase أَمَّابَعْدُ, which see in art. بعد.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
Few have mentioned its use as a corroborative:<br>\
(Mughnee:) it is thus used in the phrase أَمَّا زَيْدٌ<br>\
فَذَاهِبٌ [Whatever be the case, or happen what<br>\
will or what may, or at all events, Zeyd is going<br>\
away], when you mean that Zeyd is inevitably<br>\
going away, and determined, or decided, upon<br>\
doing so: (Z cited in the Mughnee, and K:)<br>\
therefore Sb explains it as meaning, in this case,<br>\
مَهْمَا يَكُنْ مِنْ شَىْءٍ [whatever be the case, &amp;c., as<br>\
above, or, in some instances, happen what would<br>\
or what might]; thereby showing it to be a<br>\
corroborative, and to have a conditional meaning:<br>\
(Z cited in the Mughnee: [and the same explanation of it is given, with a similar ex., in the S, in<br>\
art. امو:]) the فَ, in this case, is transferred from<br>\
its proper place before the inchoative, and put<br>\
before the enunciative. (I &#39;AK p. 306.) Ks says<br>\
that أَمَّا is used in commanding and forbidding<br>\
and announcing: you say, أَمَّا اللّٰهَ فَاعْبُدْ [Whatever be the case, or happen what will, &amp;c., God<br>\
worship thou]: and أَمَّا الخَمْرَ فَلَا تَشْرَبْهَا [i. e.<br>\
أَمَّا الخَمْرَ فَلَا تَشْرَبْهَا (as is shown in the<br>\
case of a similar ex. in the Mughnee, though you<br>\
may say أَمَّا الخَمْرُ فَلَا تَشْرَبْهَا, without an ellipsis,<br>\
like as you say أمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ as well as<br>\
أَمَّا ثَمُودَ, in the Kur xli. 16, accord. to different<br>\
readers,) Whatever be the case, &amp;c., wine (drink<br>\
not), drink not thou it]: and أَمَّا زَيْدٌ فَخَرَجَ<br>\
[Whatever be the case, &amp;c., with respect to other<br>\
things, Zeyd has gone forth; or whatever be the<br>\
case with respect to others, as for Zeyd, he has<br>\
gone forth]: whereas إِمَّا [which see in the next<br>\
paragraph] is used in expressing a condition and in<br>\
expressing doubt and in giving option and in<br>\
taking option. (T.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [IHsh says that in his<br>\
opinion,] in the phrase أَمَّا العَبِيدَ فَذُو عَبِيدٍ, thus<br>\
heard, with العبيد in the accus. case, the meaning<br>\
is, مَهَما ذَكَرْتَ [&amp;c., i. e. Whenever thou mentionest the slaves, he is a possessor of slaves: but<br>\
I would rather say that the meaning is, أَمَّا ذِكْرُكَ<br>\
العَبِيدَ, &amp;c., i. e. as for thy mentioning the slaves,<br>\
&amp;c.]: and so in similar phrases which have been<br>\
heard. (Mughnee.)<br>\
-A2-  Distinct from the foregoing is أَمَّا in the saying in the Kur [xxvii. 86],<br>\
أَمَّا ذاكُنْتُمْ تَعمَلُونَ [Or rather, what is it that<br>\
ye were doing?]: for here it is a compound of the<br>\
unconnected أَمْ and the interrogative مَا (Mughnee.)<br>\
-A3-  So too in the saying of the poet,<br>\
أَبَا خُرَاشَةَ أَمَّا أَنْتَ ذَا نَسفَرٍ<br>\
فَإنَّ قُوْمِىَ لَمْ تَأكُلْهُمُ الضَّبُعُ<br>\
[O Aboo-Khurásheh, because thou wast possessor<br>\
of a number of men dost thou boast? Verily, my<br>\
people, the year of dearth, or of sterility, hath not<br>\
consumed them]: for here it is a compound of the<br>\
أَنْ termed مَصُدَرِيَّة [which combines with a verb<br>\
following it to form an equivalent to an inf. n.]<br>\
and the redundant مَا: أَمَّا أَنْتَ is for لِأَنْ كُنْتَ;<br>\
the preposition and the verb are suppressed for<br>\
the sake of abridgment, so that the pronoun [تَ<br>\
in كُنْتَ] becomes separate; and مَا is substituted<br>\
for the verb [thus deprived of its affixed pronoun], and the ن [of ان] is incorporated into the<br>\
م [of ما]. (Mughnee.) [See another reading of<br>\
this verse voce إِمَّا; and there also, immediately<br>\
after, another ex. (accord. to the Mughnee) of<br>\
أَمَّا used in the manner explained above. See also<br>\
أَنْ as a conditional particle, like إِنْ.]<br>\
-A4-  Also<br>\
i. q. إِمَّا, q. v. (Mughnee, K.)<br>\
إِمَّا is sometimes written أَمَّا, and sometimes its<br>\
first م is changed into ى, [forming أَيْمَا or إِيْمَا or<br>\
both, as will be shown below,] (Mughnee, [in<br>\
my copy of which it is written أَيْمَا, and so in<br>\
some copies of the K,] and K, [in some copies of<br>\
which it is written إيمَا,]) and it is held by Sb to<br>\
be a compound of إِنْ and مَا, (Mughnee,) or as<br>\
denoting the complement of a condition it is a<br>\
compound of إِنْ and مَا. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It denotes<br>\
doubt; (Ks, T, Mughnee, K;) as in مَا أَدْرِى مَنْ<br>\
قَامَ إِمَّا زَيْدٌوإِمَّا عَمْرٌو [I know not who stood:<br>\
either Zeyd or &#39;Amr]: (Ks, T:) and جَآءَنِى إِمَّا<br>\
زَيْدٌ وَإِمَّا عَمْرٌو [There came to me either Zeyd or<br>\
&#39;Amr], said when one knows not which of them<br>\
came. (Mughnee, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It also denotes vagueness of meaning; as in [the Kur ix. 107,] إِمَّا<br>\
يُعَذِّبُهُم وأمَّا يَتُوبُ عَلَيْهِمْ [Either He will punish<br>\
them or He will turn unto them with forgiveness].<br>\
(Mughnee, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It also denotes giving option;<br>\
as in [the Kur xviii. 85,] إِمَّا أَن تُعَذِّبَ وإِمَّا أَنْ<br>\
تَتَّخِذَ فِيِهِمْ حُسْناً [Either do thou punish, or do<br>\
thou what is good to them]. (Mughnee, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
It also denotes the making a thing allowable;<br>\
as in تَعَلَّمْ إِمَّا فِقْهًا وإِمَّا نَحْوًا [Learn thou either<br>\
low or syntax; (an ex. given in the T, on the<br>\
authority of Ks, as an instance of the usage of<br>\
إِمَّا to denote giving option;)] but its use with<br>\
this intent is disputed by some, (Mughnee, K,)<br>\
while they assert it of أَوْ. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b6-  It is<br>\
also used as a partitive; as in [the Kur lxxvi. 3,]<br>\
إمَّا شَاكِراً و إمَّا كَفُورًا [Either, or whether, being<br>\
thankful or being unthankful]; (Mughnee, K;)<br>\
the two epithets being here in the accus. case as<br>\
denotatives of state: or, accord. to the Koofees,<br>\
إمَّا may be here [a compound of] the conditional إِنْ<br>\
and the redundant مَا; كَانَ, accord. to Ibn-EshShejeree, being understood after it: (Mughnee:)<br>\
and Fr says that the meaning is, إِنْ شَكَرَ وَإِنْ كَفَرَ<br>\
[if he be thankful and if he be unthankful]. (T.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  It also denotes taking option; as in the saying,<br>\
لِى دَارٌ بِالكُوفَةِ فَأنَا خَارِجٌ إلَيْهَا فَإمَّا أَنْ أَسْكُنَهَا وإِمَّا أَنْ<br>\
أَبِيعَهَا [I have a house in El-Koofeh, and I am<br>\
going forth to it, and either I will inhabit it or I<br>\
will sell it: but this is similar to the usage first<br>\
mentioned above]. (Ks, T.) ―<br>\
-b8-  It is a conjunction,<br>\
(S in art. امو, and Mughnee,) accord. to most<br>\
authorities, i. e., the second إِمَّا in the like of the<br>\
saying, جَاءَنِى إمَّا زَيْدٌ وإِمَّا عَمْرٌو [mentioned<br>\
above]; (Mughnee;) used in the manner of أَوْ<br>\
in all its cases except this one, that in the use of<br>\
او you begin with assurance, and then doubt<br>\
comes upon you; whereas you begin with إِمَّا in<br>\
doubt, and must repeat it; as in the saying last<br>\
mentioned: (S: [and the like is said in the<br>\
Mughnee, after the explanations of the meanings:]) but some assert that it is like the first إِمَّا,<br>\
not a conjunction; because it is generally preceded by the conjunction و: and some assert that<br>\
إِمَّا conjoins the noun with the noun, and the و<br>\
conjoins إِمَّا with إِمَّا; but the conjoining of a<br>\
particle with a particle is strange. (Mughnee.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b9-  Sometimes the و is suppressed; as in the<br>\
following verse, (Mughnee,) of El-Ahwas; (S;)<br>\
يَا لَيْتَمَا أُمُّنِا شَالَتْ نَعَامَتُهَا<br>\
أَيْمَا إِلَى جَنَّةٍ أَيْمَا إِلَى نَارِ<br>\
[O, would that our mother took her departure,<br>\
either to Paradise or Hell-fire!]; (S,* Mughnee,<br>\
K;) cited by Ks, with ايما for إِمَّا: (T:) and<br>\
sometimes it is with kesr [i. e. إِيمَا]: (S:) IB<br>\
says that it is correctly إِمَّا, with kesr; asserting<br>\
the original to be إِمَّا, with kesr, only. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
And sometimes the former مَا is dispensed with;<br>\
as in the following verse, (Mughnee,) which<br>\
shows also that مَا is sometimes suppressed;<br>\
سَقَتْهُ ارَّوَاعِدُ مِنْ صَيِّفٍ<br>\
وَإِنْ مِنْ خَرِيفٍ فَلَنْ يَعْدَمَا<br>\
[The thundering clouds of summer-rain watered him, or of autumn-rain; so he will not<br>\
want sufficient drink]: i. e. إِمَّا مِنْ صَيِّفٍ وَإِمَّا مِنْ<br>\
خَرِيفٍ. (Mughnee, K.) Mbr and As say that<br>\
إِنْ is here conditional, and that the ف is its complement: but this assertion is of no weight; for<br>\
the object is the description of a mountain-goat as<br>\
having sufficient drink in every case: AO says<br>\
that إِنْ in this verse is redundant. (Mughnee.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b11-  Sometimes, also, one does not require to mention the second إِمَّا, by mentioning what supplies<br>\
its place; as in the saying, إِمَّا أَنْ تَتَكَلَّمَ بِخَيْرٍ<br>\
وَإِلَّا فاسْكُتْ [Either do thou speak what is good or<br>\
else be silent]. (Mughnee.) [See art. الا, near<br>\
its end.]<br>\
-A2-  Distinct from the foregoing is إِمَّا in<br>\
the saying in the Kur [xix. 26], فَإِمَّأِتَريِنَّ مِنَ<br>\
الْبَشَرِ أَحَدًاِ [And if thou see, of mankind, any<br>\
one]: for this is [a compound of] the conditional<br>\
إِن and the redundant مَا. (S * in art. امو, and<br>\
Mughnee.) [In like manner,] you say, in expressing a condition, إِمَّا تَشْتِمَنَّ زْيدًا فَإِنَّهُ يَحْلُمُ عَنْكَ<br>\
[If thou revile Zeyd, he will treat thee with forbearance]. (Ks, T.) And إِمَّا تَأْتِنِي أُكِْرِمْكَ [If<br>\
thou come to me, I will treat thee with honour].<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In the following saying, إِمَّا أَنْتَ مُنْطَلِقًا<br>\
انْطَلَقْتُ [If thou be going away, I go away], the<br>\
مَا is not that which restrains the particle to which<br>\
it is subjoined from governing, but is a substitute<br>\
for a verb; (K and TA in art. مَا;) as though the<br>\
speaker said, إِذَا صِرْتَ مُنْطَلِقًا [or rather إِنْ صِرْتَ].<br>\
(TA in that art.) And hence the saying of the<br>\
poet, [of which a reading different from that here<br>\
following has been given voce أَمَّا,]<br>\
أَبَا خُرَاشَةَ إِمَّا أَنْتَ ذَا نَسفَرٍ<br>\
فَإنَّ قَوْمِىَ لَمْ تَإْكُلْهُمُ الضَّبُغُ<br>\
[O Aboo-Khurásheh, if thou be possessor of a<br>\
number of men, verily, my people, the year of<br>\
dearth, or of sterility, hath not consumed them];<br>\
as though he said, إِنْ كُنْتُ ذَا نَفَرٍ. (TA in that<br>\
art.) [But IHsh states the case differently; saying,] An instance of أَمَّا أَنْتَ مُنطَلِقًا انْطَلَقْتُ not used to restrain from<br>\
governing, but as a substitute for a verb, occurs in<br>\
the saying, أَمَّا أَنْتَ مُنطَلِقًا اِنْطَلَقْتُ [Because thou<br>\
wast going away, I went away]; originally,<br>\
اِنْطَلَقْتُ لِأَنْ كُنْتَ مُنطَلِقاً: [for an explanation<br>\
of which, see what is said of أَمَّا أَنْتَ in a reading<br>\
of the verse commencing with أَبَا خُرَاشَة voce أَمَّا:]<br>\
but accord. to El-Fárisee and IJ, the government<br>\
belongs to مَا; not to كَانَ [or كُنْتَ]. (Mughnee in art. مَا.) ―<br>\
-b3-  So too in the saying, اِفْعَلْ هذَا<br>\
إِمَّالَا, meaning إِنْ كُنْتَ لَاتَفْعَلُ غَيْرَهُ [i. e. Do<br>\
thou this if thou wilt not do another thing; or do<br>\
thou this at least]; (Mughnee and K, each in<br>\
art. مَا;) indicating a person&#39;s refusal to do [fully]<br>\
that which he is ordered to do: (TA in that art.:)<br>\
or إِمَّالَا فَافْعَلْ كَذَا, meaning if thou wilt not do<br>\
that, then do thou this; the three particles [إِنْ<br>\
and مَا and لَا] being made as one word: so says<br>\
Lth: (T:) [J says,] إِمَّالَا فَافْعَلْ كَذَا is pronounced with imáleh, [i. e. “ immá-lè,”] and is<br>\
originally إِن لَا with مَا as a connective; and the<br>\
meaning is, if that thing will not be, then do thou<br>\
thus: (S in art. لَا:) [but] AHát [disallows this<br>\
pronunciation, and] says, sometimes the vulgar,<br>\
in the place of اِفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ إِمَّالَا, say, اِفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ بَارِى<br>\
[Do thou that at least]; but this is Persian, and is<br>\
rejected as wrong: and they say also, أُمَّالَىْ, with<br>\
damm to the ا [and with imáleh in the case of the<br>\
final vowel, and thus it is vulgarly pronounced in<br>\
the present day]; but this too is wrong; for it is<br>\
correctly إِمَّالَا, [with kesr, and] not pronounced<br>\
with imáleh, for particles [in general] are not<br>\
thus pronounced: (T:) and the vulgar also convert the hemzeh into ه with damm [saying هُمَّالَىْ].<br>\
(TA in art. مَا.) [Fei says,] لَا is a substitute for<br>\
the verb in the saying, إِمَّالَا فَافْعَلْ هٰذَا, the meaning being If thou do not that, then [at least] do<br>\
thou this: the origin thereof is this; that certain<br>\
things are incumbent on a man to do, and he is<br>\
required to do them, but refuses; and then one is<br>\
content with his doing some, or a part, of them,<br>\
and says to him thus: i. e., if thou wilt not do<br>\
all, then do thou this: then the verb is suppressed,<br>\
on account of the frequency of the usage of the<br>\
phrase, and مَا is added to give force to the<br>\
meaning: and some say that it is for this reason<br>\
that لَا is here pronounced with imáleh; because<br>\
it serves for the verb; like as بَلَى is, and the<br>\
vocative يَا: but it is said that it is correctly pronounced without imáleh; because particles [in<br>\
general] are not pronounced therewith; as Az<br>\
says. (Msb in art. لَا.) [El-Hareeree says that]<br>\
إِمَّالَا is properly [a compound of] three particles,<br>\
which are إِنْ and مَا and لَا, made as one word,<br>\
and the ا at the end thereof is like the ا of حُبَارَى<br>\
[in which it is written ى, agreeably with rule];<br>\
wherefore it is pronounced with imáleh, like as is<br>\
the ا of this latter word. (Durrat el-Ghowwás, in<br>\
De Sacy&#39;s Anthol. Gr. Ar. p. 57 of the Arabic<br>\
text.) In the Lubáb it is said that لَا is used as a<br>\
negative of the future, as in لا تَفْعَلْ; and the<br>\
verb [in إِمَّالَا] is suppressed; so it [لا] serves as a<br>\
substitute in the saying, اِفْعَلْ هٰذَا إِمَّالَا; therefore<br>\
they pronounce its ا with imáleh: and IAth says<br>\
that the Arabs sometimes pronounced لَا with a<br>\
slight imáleh; and the vulgar make the imáleh<br>\
thereof full, so that its ا becomes ى; but this is<br>\
wrong. (TA.) You say also, خُذْ هٰذَا إِمَّالَا,<br>\
meaning Take thou this if thou take not that.<br>\
(T.) It is related that the Prophet saw a runaway<br>\
camel, and said, “To whom belongeth this camel? ”<br>\
when, lo, some young men of the Ansár said,<br>\
“ We have drawn water upon him during twenty<br>\
years, and yet he has in him fat; so we desired<br>\
to slaughter him; but he escaped from us. ” He<br>\
said, “Will ye sell him? ” They answered, “No:<br>\
but he is thine. ” And he said, إِمَّالَا فأَحْسِنُوا إِلَيْهِ<br>\
حَتَّى يأْتِيَهُ أَجَلُهُ, meaning If ye will not sell him,<br>\
act well to him until his term of life come to<br>\
him. (T.)<br>\
