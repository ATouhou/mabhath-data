أَكَلَهُ, [aor.<br>\
اَكُلَ,] inf. n. أَكْلٌ and مَأْكَلٌ, [He<br>\
ate it,] (S, K,) namely, food. (S.) Er-Rummánee says that أَكْلٌ properly signifies The<br>\
swallowing food after chewing it; so that the<br>\
swallowing of pebbles is not properly thus termed:<br>\
(Msb:) or, accord. to Ibn-El-Kemál, the conveying, or transmitting, to the belly what may be<br>\
chewed, whether [the thing be] chewed or not; so<br>\
that it does not apply to milk, nor to سَوِيق: and<br>\
as to the saying of the poet,<br>\
مِنَ الآكِلِينَ المَآءَ ظُلْمًا فَمَا أَرَى<br>\
يَنَالُونَ خَيْرًا بَعْدَ أَكْلِهِمُ المَآءَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Of the eaters of what they purchase with the<br>\
price of water, wrongfully, I do not see any attain<br>\
good after their eating of what they have purchased with the price of the water,] he means<br>\
a people who used to sell water and purchase<br>\
with the price thereof what they would eat:<br>\
(TA:) [for you say, أَكَلَ كَذَا as meaning (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
ate the price of such a thing: see another ex. voce<br>\
إِكَافٌ; and another voce ثَدْىٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  The saying,<br>\
in the Kur [v. 70], لَأَكَلُوا مِنْ فَوْقِهِمْ وَمِنْ تَحْتِ<br>\
أَرْجُلِهِمْ [They should eat things above them and<br>\
things beneath their feet] means, their means of<br>\
subsistence should be made ample; (Bd, TA;)<br>\
by the pouring of the blessings of the heaven and<br>\
the earth upon them; or by the abundance of the<br>\
fruit of the trees, and the produce of the grains<br>\
sown; or by their being blessed with gardens<br>\
of ripe fruits, so that they should gather them<br>\
from the upper part of each tree, and pick up<br>\
what should have fallen upon the ground. (Bd.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  اِنْقَطَعَ أَكْلُهُ [lit. His eating became cut off,<br>\
or stopped,] means (tropical:)  he died; [see also أُكُلٌ;]<br>\

and يَأْكُلُ لُحُومَ النَّاسِ [He eats men, and eats<br>\
the flesh of men,] means (tropical:)  he defames men; or<br>\
does so in their absence: (TA:) and the action<br>\
thus signified may be [with words, or by making<br>\
signs] with the side of the mouth, and with the<br>\
eye, and with the head. (TA in art. همز.) It is<br>\
said in the Kur [xlix. 12], أَيُحِبُّ أَحَدُكُمْ أَنْ<br>\
يَأْكلَ لَحْمَ أَخِيهِ مَيْتًا [lit. Would any one of you<br>\
like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead?];<br>\
defamation, or defamation of the absent, being<br>\
meant thereby. (S, * Ibn-&#39; Arafeh, Bd, Jel.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
أَكَلَ غَنَمِى وَ شَرِبَهَا (tropical:)  [He ate the flesh of my sheep,<br>\
and drank the milk of them, means, like أَكَلَ<br>\
مَالِى, he ate, fed upon, devoured, or consumed,<br>\
my wealth, or property: see 2]. (TA.) ―<br>\

unto me a town which shall devour the other<br>\
towns]; (K, TA;) said to be Yethrib [afterwards<br>\
called El-Medeeneh]; (TA;) i. e., the people<br>\
of which shall conquer the [other] towns and<br>\
make spoil of their possessions: or it denotes the<br>\
superior excellence of that town; and is like the<br>\
saying, هٰذَا حَدِيثٌ يَأْكُلُ الأَحَادِيثَ [This is a<br>\

(K:) so the last is written accord. to the correct<br>\
copies of the K: accord. to Esh-Shiháb, in the<br>\
Shifá el-Ghaleel, it would seem to be أُكْلَةٌ; but<br>\
this is at variance with the authority of the leading<br>\
lexicologists: the same word, أَكِلَةٌ, is also explained in the K as signifying a disease in a limb,<br>\
or member, in consequence of which one part is<br>\
[as it were] eaten by another; [a meaning which<br>\
I believe to be correct, (see أُكَالٌ,) although SM<br>\
says,] but this is identical with the itch, or an<br>\
itching: and ↓ أَكَلَانٌ is a vulgar term for the<br>\
same; and so is ↓ آكِلَةٌ, with medd, given as<br>\
correct by Eth-Tha&#39;álibee, in [his book entitled]<br>\
the Mudáf and Mensoob, but disallowed by ElKhafájee. (TA.) One says, إِنِّى لَأَجِدُ فِى جَسَدِى<br>\
إِكْلَةً (tropical:)  [Verily I experience in my body an itching.] (S.)<br>\
أَكِلَةٌ: see إِكْلَةٌ.<br>\

أُكَالٌ (tropical:)  A corrosion, or cankering, or decaying,<br>\
of a limb, or member, [and of a sore,] from the<br>\
mutual eating away of its several parts; as also<br>\
↓ إِكَالٌ. (K, TA.) [See also أَكِلَةٌ, voce إِكْلَةٌ,<br>\
where a similar meaning is assigned to the former<br>\
of these two words; and the same seems to be<br>\
indicated in the Msb.] ―<br>\

-b3-  بَهَا أُكَالٌ, said of a she-camel, (tropical:)  She has an itching and annoyance in her<br>\

Msb, K) to be eaten, (S, Mgh, K,) [i. e.] to be<br>\
slaughtered, (Msb,) and which is fattened, (S,<br>\
Mgh,) and the taking of which by the collector of<br>\
the poor-rate is disapproved; (S;) not left to<br>\
pasture by itself, being of the best of the beasts:<br>\
(Msb:) and ↓ أَكِيلَةٌ occurs in the same sense,<br>\
applied to a sheep, or goat, fattened to be eaten.<br>\
(Mgh.) Hence the prov., مَرْعًى وَلَا أَكُولَةً [lit.<br>\
Pasturage, and no اكولة]; meaning (assumed tropical:)  wealth<br>\
collected together, and none expended. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also Barren; applied to a sheep or goat [app.<br>\
because such is generally eaten]. (K.)<br>\
أُكُولَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
أَكِيلَةٌ and ↓ أَكِيلٌ and ↓ أُكُولَةٌ, with two<br>\
dammehs, (K,) so in the copies of the K, but<br>\
perhaps a mistake for ↓ أُكْلَةٌ, (TA,) a word of a<br>\
bad dial., (K, * TA,) and ↓ مَأْكُولٌ and ↓ مُؤَاكِلٌ,<br>\
(K, TA, [in some copies of the former of which,<br>\
instead of وَهِىَ قَبِيحَةٌ وَ المَأْكُولِ وَ المَؤَاكِلِ, meaning, as is said in the TA, وَهِىَ لُغَةٌ قَبِيحَةٌ &amp;c., we<br>\
