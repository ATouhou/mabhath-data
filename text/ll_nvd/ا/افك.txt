the thing]; (S;) or عَنْ وَجْهِهِ [from his, or its,<br>\
mode, or manner, of being, &amp;c.]: (Msb:) so in<br>\
the Kur xlvi. 21, أَجِئْتَنَا لِتَأْفِكَنَا عَنْ آلِهَتِنَا Hast<br>\
thou come to us to turn us away, or back, from<br>\

uttered a falsehood; said what was untrue;<br>\

was untrue. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  أُفِكَ He was weak [as<br>\
though perverted] in his intellect and judgment<br>\
