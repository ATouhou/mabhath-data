أَيَّا آيَةً, [inf. n., by rule, as below,] He put,<br>\
or set, a sign, token, or mark, by which a person<br>\
or thing might be known. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  أَيَّا بِلإِبِلِ,<br>\
(inf. n. تَأْييَةٌ, Lth, T,) He chid the camels, saying<br>\
to them أَيَايَا, (Lth, T, M, and K in art. أَيَا,) or<br>\
أَيَايَهْ, (M,) or يَايَا, (K,) or يَايَهْ. (M, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تأيّا, as a trans. verb: see 6.<br>\
-A2-  He paused,<br>\
stopped, stayed, remained, or tarried, (T, S,<br>\
M, K, *) بِا لمَكَانِ in the place; (M, K; * [in the<br>\
latter explained by تَلَبَّثَ عَلَيْهِ; but this seems to<br>\
be a mistake, arising from the omission of part<br>\
of a passage in the M, (one of the chief sources of<br>\
the K,) running thus; تَأَيَّا بِا لمَكَانِ تَلَبَّثَ وَتَمَكَّثَ<br>\
وَتَأَيَّا عَلَيْهِ انْصَرَفَ فِى تُؤَدَةٍ;]) and confined, restricted, limited, restrained, or withheld, himself.<br>\
(T.) In the sense of its inf. n., [by rule تَأَىّ,<br>\
originally تَأَيُّىٌ,] they said ↓ تَأَيَّةٌ, or تَإِيَّةٌ or تَئِيَّةٌ;<br>\
[thus differently written in different places in<br>\
copies of the T and S;] as in the ex. لَيْسَ مَنْزِلُكُمْ<br>\
بِدَارِ تَأَيَّةٍ or تَإِيَّةٍ, (IAar, T,) or لَيْسَ مَنْزِلُكُمْ هٰذَا<br>\
بِمَنْزِلِ تَأَيَّةٍ or تَإِيَّةٍ, (S,) i. e. Your abode, or this<br>\
your abode, is not an abode of tarriance and<br>\
confinement. (IAar, T, S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He expected, or<br>\
waited for, a thing: (Lth, T:) and he acted with<br>\
moderation, gently, deliberately, or leisurely;<br>\
without haste; or with gravity, staidness, sedateness, or calmness; (Lth, T, K;) فِى الأَمْرِ in the<br>\
affair; inf. n. تَأىٍ. (Lth, T.) تَأَيَّيْتُ عَلَيْهِ, in<br>\
a verse of Lebeed, means I acted with moderation, &amp;c., as above, and paused, stopped, stayed,<br>\
remained, or tarried, upon him, i. e., upon my<br>\
horse: (T:) or I remained firm upon him:<br>\
(TA, as on the authority of Az:) but it is explained by Lth as meaning I turned away, or<br>\
back, deliberately, or leisurely, upon him. (T:<br>\
and the like is said in the M.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَآيَيْتُهُ, (T, S, M, * K,) and ↓ تَأَيَّيْتُهُ, (S, K,)<br>\
I directed my course, or aim, to, or towards,<br>\
(T, S, M, * K,) his آيَة, (S, M,) i. e., (M,) his<br>\
شَخْص [or body, or corporeal form or figure or<br>\
substance, seen from a distance; or person]. (T,<br>\
M, K.) The following is an ex., as some relate<br>\
it, of the former verb; and as others relate it, of<br>\
the latter:<br>\
اَلْحُصْنُ أَوْلَى لَوْ تَآيُيْتِهِ<br>\
مِنْ حَثْيِكِ التُّرْبَ عَلَى الرَّاكِبِ<br>\
[Modest behaviour were more proper, if thou<br>\
directedst thy course towards his person, than<br>\
thy throwing dust upon the rider]: (S, TA: [in<br>\
two copies of the former of which, for أَوْلَى, I<br>\
find أَدْنَى:]) said by a woman to her daughter,<br>\
on the latter&#39;s relating, in a couplet, that a rider,<br>\
passing along, had seen her, and she had thrown<br>\
dust in his face, purposely. (IB.)<br>\
أَىْ a vocative particle, (S, M, Mughnee, K,)<br>\
addressed to the near, (S, K,) not to the distant:<br>\
(S:) or to the near, or the distant, or the intermediate; accord. to different authorities. (Mughnee.) You say, أَىْ زَيْدُ أَقْبِلْ [O Zeyd, advance:<br>\
or, if it may be used in addressing one who is<br>\
distant, ho there, soho, or holla: and if used in<br>\
addressing one who is between near and distant,<br>\
ho, or what ho]: (S:) and أَىْ رَبِّ [O my Lord];<br>\
occurring in a trad.: and sometimes it is pronounced ↓ آىْ. (Mughnee.)<br>\
-A2-  Also an explicative<br>\
particle. (S, M, Mughnee, K.) You say, أَىْ كَذَا<br>\
in the sense of يُرِيدُ كَذَا [He means such a thing,<br>\
or يَعْنِى كَذَا, which has the same signification;<br>\
or أُرِيدُ, or أَعْنِى, I mean; or the like; for all of<br>\
which, we may say, meaning; or that is]; (S;)<br>\
as in عِنْدِى عَسْجِدٌ أَىْ ذَهَبٌ [I have عَسْجَد, that<br>\
is, (I have) ذَهَبَ, or gold]. (Mughnee.) What<br>\
follows it is an adjunct explicative of what precedes it, or a substitute. (Mughnee.) AA says<br>\
that he asked Mbr respecting what follows it, and<br>\
he answered that it may be a substitute for what<br>\
precedes, and may be a word independent of<br>\
what precedes it, and may be a noun in the accus.<br>\
case: and that he asked Th, and he answered<br>\
that it may be an explicative, or a word independent of what precedes it, or a noun governed<br>\
in the accus. case by a verb suppressed: you say,<br>\
جَآءَنِى أَخُوكَ أَىْ زَيْدٌ [Thy brother came to me;<br>\
that is, Zeyd]; and you may say, أَىْ زَيْدًا [I<br>\
mean Zeyd]: and رَأَيْتُ أَخَاكَ أَىْ زَيْدًا [I saw thy<br>\
brother; I mean, or that is, Zeyd]; and you<br>\
may say, أَىْ زَيْدٌ [that is, Zeyd]: and مَرَرْتُ<br>\
بِأَخِيكَ أَىْ زَيْدٍ [I passed by thy brother; that is,<br>\
by Zeyd]; and you may say, أَىْ زَيدًا [I mean,<br>\
Zeyd]; and أَىْ زَيْدٌ [that is, Zeyd]. (T, TA.)<br>\
When it occurs after تَقُولُ, in a case like the following, [i. e., when a verb following it explains a<br>\
verb preceding it,] one says, تَقُولُ اِسْتَكْتَمْتُهُ الحَدِيثَ<br>\
أَىْ سَأَلْتُهُ كِتْمَانَهُ [Thou sayest, استكتمته الحديث,<br>\
meaning سألته كتمانه I asked of him the concealment of it, namely, the discourse, or story;<br>\
and so when تَقُولُ is understood, as is often, or<br>\
generally, the case in lexicons]; with damm to<br>\
the ت: but if you put إِذَا in the place of أَىْ, you<br>\
say, إِذَا سَأَلْتَهُ, with fet-h, because أَذا is an adverbial<br>\
noun relating to تَقُولُ. (Mughnee.)<br>\
-A3-  See also<br>\
أَىٌّ, near the beginning of the paragraph, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
إِىْ is a particle denoting a reply, meaning نَعَمْ<br>\
[Yes, or yea]; importing acknowledgment of the<br>\
truth of an enunciation; and the making a thing<br>\
known, to him who asks information; and a promise, to him who seeks or demands; therefore it<br>\
occurs after such sayings as “Zeyd stood” and<br>\
“Did Zeyd stand.?” and “Beat thou Zeyd,” and<br>\
the like; as does نَعَمْ: Ibn-El-Hájib asserts that<br>\
it occurs only after an interrogation; as in the<br>\
saying [in the Kur x. 54], وَيَسْتَنْبِؤُنَكَ أَحَقٌّ هُوَ قُلٌ<br>\
إِ ىْ وَرَبِىّ [And they will ask thee to inform them,<br>\
saying, Is it true? Say, Yea, by my Lord!]:<br>\
but accord. to all, it does not occur otherwise than<br>\
before an oath: and when one says, إِ ىْ وَاللّٰهِ<br>\
[Yea, by God!], and then drops the و the ى<br>\
may be quiescent, and with fet-h, and elided; [so<br>\
that you say, إِ ىْ اللّٰهِ, and إِ ىَ اللّٰهِ, and إِ اللّٰهِ;] in<br>\
the first of which cases, two quiescent letters<br>\
occur together, irregularly. (Mughnee.) Lth says,<br>\
إِ ىْ is an oath, as in إ ِىْ وَرَبِّى meaning, says<br>\
Zj, نَعَمْ وَرَبِّى: IAar is also related to have said<br>\
the like; and this is the correct explanation. (T.)<br>\
[J says,] It is a word preceding an oath, meaning<br>\
بَلَى [q. v.]; as in إِ ىْ وَرَبِّى and إِ ىْ وَاللّٰه. (S.)<br>\
[ISd and F say,] It is syn. with نَعَمْ, and is conjoined with an oath: and one says also هِىْ.<br>\
(M, K.)<br>\
أَىٌّ is a noun, used in five different manners.<br>\
(Mughnee.) One of its meanings is that of an<br>\
interrogative, (T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) relating to<br>\
intellectual beings and to non-intellectual things;<br>\
[meaning Who? which? and what?] (S, M, K;)<br>\
and as such, it is a decl. noun: (S:) it is said in<br>\
the K to be a particle; (MF;) and so in the M;<br>\
(TA;) but this is wrong: (MF:) and it is added<br>\
in the K that it is indecl.; (MF;) and it is said<br>\
to be so in the M, accord. to Sb, in an instance<br>\
to be explained below; (TA;) but this is only<br>\
when it is a conjunct noun [like الَّذِى], or denotes<br>\
the object of a vocative: (MF:) or, accord. to<br>\
some, it is decl. as a conjunct noun also. (Mughnee.) You say, أَيُّهُمْ أَخُوكَ [Who, or which, of<br>\
them, is thy brother?]. (S.) Another ex. is the<br>\
saying [in the Kur vii. 184, and last verse of<br>\
lxxvii.], فَبِأَىِّ حَدِيثٍ بَعْدَهُ يُؤْمِنُونَ [And in what<br>\
announcement, after it, will they believe?]. (Mughnee.) Sometimes it is without teshdeed; as in the<br>\
saying (of El-Farezdak, M),<br>\
↓ تَنَظَّرْتُ نَصْرًا وَالسِّمَاكَيْنِ أَيْهُمَا<br>\
عَلَىَّ مِنَ الغَيْثِ اسْتَهَلَّتْ مَوَاطِرُهْ<br>\
[I looked for rain, or aid from the clouds, and<br>\
the two Simáks (stars so called). Of which of<br>\
them two did the rains pour vehemently upon me<br>\
from the clouds?]: (M, Mughnee, K: * [in the<br>\
last of which, only the former hemistich is given,<br>\
with نَسْرًا (meaning the star or asterism so called)<br>\
instead of نَصْرًا:]) so by poetic licence: (M:)<br>\
IJ says that for this reason the poet has elided<br>\
the second ى, but should have restored the first<br>\
ى to و, because it is originally و. (TA. [But<br>\
this assertion, respecting the first ى, I regard as<br>\
improbable.]) ↓ أَيْمَ, also, is a contraction of<br>\
أَىُّ مَا, meaning أَىُّ شَىْءٍ: so in the saying, أَيْمَ<br>\
هُوَ يَا فُلَانُ [What thing is it, O such a one?]:<br>\
and أَيْمَ تَقُولُ [What thing sayest thou?]. (TA<br>\
in art. ايم.) In like manner, also, ↓ أَيْشَ is used<br>\
as a contraction of أَىُّ شَىْءٍ. (Ks, TA in art.<br>\
جرم.) A poet speaks of his companions as being<br>\
بِأَىَ وَأَيْنَمَا; making أَىّ the name of the quarter<br>\
(جِهَة); so that, being determinate and of the<br>\
feminine gender, it is imperfectly declinable. (M.<br>\
[See أَينٌ; under which head two other readings<br>\
are given; and where it is said that the verse in<br>\
which this occurs is by Homeyd Ibn-Thowr.])<br>\
أَىّ is never without a noun or pronoun to which<br>\
it is prefixed, except in a vocative expression and<br>\
when it is made to conform with a word to which<br>\
it refers, as in cases to be exemplified hereafter.<br>\
(Mughnee.) Being so prefixed, it is determinate;<br>\
but sometimes, [as in the latter of the cases just<br>\
mentioned,] it is not so prefixed, yet has the<br>\
meaning of a prefixed noun. (S.) When used as<br>\
an interrogative, it is not governed, as to the<br>\
letter, though it is as to the meaning, by the verb<br>\
that precedes it, but by what follows it; as in the<br>\
saying in the Kur [xviii. 11], لِنَعْلَمَ أَىُّ الحِزْبَيْنِ<br>\
أَحْصَى [That we might know which of the two<br>\
parties was able to compute]; and in the same<br>\
[xxvi. last verse], وَسَيَعْلَمُ الَّذَينَ ظَلَمُوا أَىَ مُنْقَلَبٍ<br>\
يَنْقَلِبُونَ [And they who have acted wrongly shall<br>\
know with what a translating they shall be translated]: (Fr, * Th, Mbr, T, S: *) when it is governed by the verb before it, it has not the interrogative meaning, as will be shown hereafter.<br>\
(Fr, T.) In the saying of the poet,<br>\
تَصِيحُ بِنَا حَنِيفَةُ إذْ رَأَتْنَا<br>\
وَأَىَّ الأَرْضِ تَذْهَبُ لِلصِّيَاحِ<br>\
[Haneefeh (the tribe so named) shout to us when<br>\
they see us. And to what place of the earth, or<br>\
land, will they go for the shouting?], أَىّ is in the<br>\
accus. case because the prep. إِلَى is suppressed<br>\
before it. (S.) When they separate it [from what<br>\
follows it, not prefixing it to another noun], the<br>\
Arabs say أَىٌ, and in the dual أَيَّانِ, and in the<br>\
pl. أَيُّونَ; and they make it fem., saying أَيَّةٌ, and<br>\
[in the dual] أَيَّتَانِ, and [in the pl.] أَيَّاتٌ: but<br>\
when they prefix it to a noun, properly so called,<br>\
not a pronoun, they make it sing. and masc.,<br>\
saying أَىُ الرَّجُلَيْنِ [Who, or which, of the two<br>\
men?], and أَىُ المَرْأَتَيْنِ [Who, or which, of the<br>\
two women?], and أَىُّ الّرِجَالِ [Who, or which, of<br>\
the men?], and أَىُّ النِّسَآءِ [Who, or which, of the<br>\
women?]: and when they prefix it to a fem.<br>\
pronoun, they make it masc. [as when they prefix<br>\
it to a masc. pronoun] and fem., saying أَيُّهُمَا and<br>\
أَيَّتُهُمَا [Who, or which, of them two?], meaning<br>\
women; (Fr, T;) [the latter of which seems to<br>\
be the more common; for ISd says,] sometimes<br>\
they said أَيُّهُنَّ [Who, or which, of them? referring<br>\
to women], meaning أَيَّتُهُنَّ. (M.) It is said in<br>\
the Kur [xxxi. last verse], وَمَا تَدْرِى نَفْسٌ بِأَىِّ أَرضٍ<br>\
تَمُوتُ [And a person knoweth not in what land<br>\
he will die]: (S:) but some read بِأَيَّةِ أَرْضٍ; and<br>\
Sb compares this fem. form to كُلَّتُهُنَّ. (Bd.)<br>\
When it is used as an interrogative relating to an<br>\
indeterminate noun in a preceding phrase, أَىّ is<br>\
made to conform with that indeterminate noun in<br>\
case-ending and in gender and in number; and<br>\
this is done [alike, accord. to some,] in the case<br>\
of its connexion with a following word and in the<br>\
case of a pause; so that, [in the case of a pause,]<br>\
to him who says, جَآءَنِى رَجُلٌ [A man came to<br>\
me], you say, [accord. to the authorities alluded to<br>\
above,] أَىٌّ [Who?]; and to him who says, رَأَيْتُ<br>\
رَجُلًا [I saw a man], أَيَّا [Whom?]; and to him<br>\
who says, مَرَرْتُ بِرَجلٍ [I passed by a man], أَىٍّ<br>\
[Whom?]: and in like manner, [accord. to all<br>\
authorities,] in the case of its connexion with a<br>\
following word; as أَىُّ يَا فَتَى [Who, O young<br>\
man?], and أَيَّا يَا فَتَى [Whom, O young man?],<br>\
and أَىٍ يَا فَتَى [Whom, O young man?]: and in<br>\
the case of the fem. you say, أَيَّةٌ and أَيَّةً and أَيَّةٍ<br>\
[in the nom. and accus. and gen. respectively];<br>\
and in the dual, أَيَّانِ and أَيَّتَانِ in the nom. case<br>\
[masc. and fem. respectively], and أَيَّيْنِ and أَيَّتَيْنِ<br>\
in the accus. and gen. cases [masc. and fem.<br>\
respectively]; and in the pl., [with the like distinction of genders,] أَيُّونَ and أَيَّاتٌ in the nom.<br>\
case, and أَيِّينَ and أَيَّاتٍ in the accus. and gen.<br>\
cases. (I&#39; Ak p. 319.) [Exs. in cases of pause,<br>\
agreeing with the foregoing rules, are given in<br>\
the T; and exs. in cases of connexion with following words, agreeing with the foregoing, are<br>\
given in the Mughnee: but J gives rules differing<br>\
from the foregoing in some respects; and IB<br>\
gives rules differing in some points both from<br>\
the foregoing and from those of J.] It is said in<br>\
the S, أَىّ is made to conform with indeterminate<br>\
nouns significant of intellectual beings and of nonintellectual things, and is used as an interrogative;<br>\
and when it is thus used in reference to an indeterminate noun, you make it to have a caseending like that of the noun respecting which<br>\
it demands positive information; so that when<br>\
it is said to you, مَرَّبِى رَجُلٌ [A man passed by<br>\
me], you say, أَىٌّ يَا فَتَى [Who, O young man?],<br>\
thus giving it a case-ending [like that of رَجُلٌ]<br>\
when it is in connexion with a following word;<br>\
and you indicate the case-ending [by the pronunciation termed الرَّوْمُ, saying أَىُّ, with a somewhat obscure utterance of the final vowel,] in<br>\
pausing; and if one says, رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا [I saw a<br>\
man], you say, أَيَّا يَافَتَى [Whom, O young<br>\
man?], giving it a case-ending [like that of رَجُلًا],<br>\
with tenween, when it is [thus] in connexion with<br>\
a following word; and you pause upon the ا,<br>\
saying أَيَّا; and when one says, مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ [I<br>\
passed by a man], you say, أَىٍّ يَافَتَى [Whom,<br>\
O young man? in a case of connexion with a<br>\
following word; and أَىِّ in a case of pausing]:<br>\
you conform with what the other has said, in<br>\
the nom. and accus. and gen. cases, in the case<br>\
of connexion with a following word and in that<br>\
of pausing: but IB says that this is correct only<br>\
in the case of connexion with a following word;<br>\
for in the case of a pause, you say only أَىّْ, in<br>\
the nom. and gen., with sukoon; and you imitate<br>\
in both of these cases only when you use the<br>\
dual form or the pl.: it is added in the S, you<br>\
say in the cases of the dual and pl. and fem.<br>\
like as we have said respecting مَنْ: when one<br>\
says, جَآءَنِى رِجَالٌ [Men came to me], you say,<br>\
أَيُّونْ [Who?], with the ن quiescent; and أَيِينْ<br>\
in the accus. and gen.: but IB says, the correct<br>\
mode is to say, أَيُّونَ and أَيِّنَ, with fet-h to the<br>\
ن in both; [meaning that this is the only allowable mode in the case of connexion with a following word, and app. that it is the preferable<br>\
mode in the case of a pause;] the quiescent ن<br>\
being allowable only in the case of a pause, and<br>\
with respect to مَنْ, for you say مَنُونْ and مَنِينْ<br>\
with the quiescent ن only: it is then added in<br>\
the S, you say, also, أَيَّهْ [Who? and whom?] in<br>\
using the fem. [in a case of pause]; but in a<br>\
case of connexion with a following word, [when<br>\
referring to a noun in the accus.,] you say, أَيَّةً<br>\
يَا هٰذَا [Whom, O thou? in the sing.], and أَيَّاتٍ<br>\
[in the pl.; and in like manner, أَيَّةٌ in the nom.<br>\
sing., and أَيَّةٍ in the gen. sing.; and أَيَّاتٌ in the<br>\
nom. pl., and أَيَّاتٍ in the gen. pl.]: but when the<br>\
interrogation refers to a determinate noun, أَىّ is<br>\
in the nom. case (with refa) only. (TA.) [See also<br>\
أَيَّانَ, below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [In other cases, now to be mentioned, it is used alike as sing., dual, and pl.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
It also denotes a condition; (T, S, M, Mughnee;)<br>\
in which case, also, it is a decl. noun, applied<br>\
to an intellectual being and to a non-intellectual<br>\
thing. (S.) So in the saying, أَيُّهُمْ يُكْرِمْنِى أُكْرِمْهُ<br>\
[Whichever of them treats me with honour, I<br>\
will treat him with honour]. (S.) So, too, in<br>\
the saying [in the Kur xvii. 110], أَيًّا مَا تَدْعُوا فَلَهُ<br>\
الأَسْمَآءُ الحُسْنَى [Whichever ye call Him, He<br>\
hath the best names]. (T, * Mughnee.) And in<br>\
the saying [in the same, xxviii. 28], أَيَّمَا الْأَجَلَيْنِ<br>\
قَضَيْتُ فَلَا عُدْوَانَ عَلَىَّ [Whichever of the two<br>\
terms I fulfil, there shall be no wrongdoing to<br>\
me]. (Mughnee.) One says also, صَحِبَهُ اللّٰهُ أَيَّا<br>\
مَا تَوَجَّهَ, meaning أَيْنَمَاتَوَجَّهَ [May God accompany him wherever he goeth]. (AZ, T.) And<br>\
Zuheyr uses the expression أَيَّةً سَلَكُوا for أَيَّةَ وِجْهَةٍ<br>\
سَلَكُوا [Whatever tract they travelled, or travel].<br>\
(T.) The saying, أَيِّى وَأَيُّكَ كَانَ شَرَّا فَأَخْزَاهُ اللّٰهُ<br>\
[Whichever of me and thee be evil, may God<br>\
abase him !] was explained by Kh to Sb as meaning أَيُّنَا كَانَ شَرًّا [whichever of us two be evil];<br>\
and as being like the saying, أَخْزَى اللّٰهُ الكَاذِبَ<br>\
مِنِىّ وَمِنْكَ, meaning مِنَّا. (M. [And in a similar<br>\
manner, the former clause of that saying, occurring in a verse, with مَا after أَيِّى, is said in the<br>\
T to have been explained by Kh to Sb.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  It<br>\
is also a conjunct noun; (Mughnee;) [i. e.] it is<br>\
sometimes used in the manner of الَّذِى, and therefore requires a complement; as in the saying,<br>\
أَيُّهُمْ فِى الدَّارِ أَخُوكَ [He, of them, who is in the<br>\
house is thy brother]: (S:) [i. e.] it is syn. with<br>\
الَّذِى. (M, Mughnee.) So in the saying [in the<br>\
Kur xix. 70], ثُمَّ لَنَنْزِعَنَّ مِنْ كُلِّ شِيعَةٍ أَيُّهُمْ أَشَدُّ<br>\
عَلَى الرَّحْمٰنِ عُتِيَّا [Then we will assuredly draw<br>\
forth, from every sect, him, of them, who is<br>\
most exorbitantly rebellious against the Compassionate]: so says Sb: but the Koofees and a<br>\
number of the Basrees disagree with him, holding<br>\
that the conjunct noun أَىّ is always decl., like<br>\
the conditional and the interrogative: Zj says,<br>\
“It has not appeared to me that Sb has erred<br>\
except in two instances, whereof this is one;<br>\
for he has conceded that it is decl. when separate,<br>\
and how can he say that it is indecl. when it is a<br>\
prefixed noun?” and El-Jarmee says, “I have<br>\
gone forth from El-Basrah, and have not heard,<br>\
from my leaving the Khandak to Mekkeh, any<br>\
one say, لَأَضْرِبَنَّ أَيُّهُمْ قَائِمٌ [as meaning I will<br>\
assuredly beat him, of them, who is standing],<br>\
with damm:” these assert, that it is, in the verse<br>\
above, an interrogative, and that it is an inchoative, and اشد is an enunciative: but they differ<br>\
as to the objective complement of the verb: Kh<br>\
says that this is suppressed, and that the implied<br>\
meaning is, we will assuredly draw forth those<br>\
of whom it will be said, Which of them is most<br>\
&amp;c.? and Yoo says that it is the proposition<br>\
[ايهّم &amp;c.], and that the verb is suspended from<br>\
governing, as in the instance in the Kur xviii. 11,<br>\
cited above: and Ks and Akh say that it is<br>\
كلّ شيعة, that من is redundant, and that the interrogative proposition is independent of what precedes it; this being grounded on their saying that<br>\
the redundance of مِنْ is allowable in an affirmative proposition: but these [following] facts refute<br>\
their sayings; viz. that the suspension of government is peculiar to verbs significant of operations<br>\
of the mind; and that it is not allowable to say,<br>\
لَأَضْرِبَنَّ الفَاسِقُ, with refa, as meaning by implication “I will assuredly beat him of whom it is<br>\
said, He is the transgressor;” and that the redundance of مِنْ in an affirmative proposition is<br>\
not correct. (Mughnee. [Some further remarks<br>\
on the same subject, in that work, mentioning<br>\
other opinions as erroneous, I omit. Another<br>\
reading of the passage in the Kur cited above<br>\
(xix. 70) will be found in what here follows.])<br>\
[ISd states that] they said, لَأَضْربَنَّ أَيُّهُمْ أَفْضَلُ<br>\
[I will assuredly beat him, of them, who is most<br>\
excellent], and أَىٌّ أَفْضَلُ [him who is most excel-lent]; اىّ being indecl., accord. to Sb, and therefore the verb does not govern it [save as to the<br>\
meaning]. (M.) And [that] you say, اِضْرِبْ أَيُّهُمْ<br>\
أَفْضَلُ [Beat thou him, of them, who is most excellent], and أَيَّهُمْ أَفْضَلُ [meaning the same, or<br>\
whichever of them, &amp;c.]; suppressing the relative<br>\
هُوَ after ايّهم. (M in a later part of the same<br>\
art.) Fr says that when أَىّ is governed by the<br>\
verb before it, it has not the interrogative meaning; and you may say, لَأَضْرِبَنَّ أَيَّهُمْ يَقُولُ ذٰلِكَ<br>\
[I will assuredly beat him, of them, or whichever of them, says that]: and he says that he who<br>\
reads أَيَّهُمْ, in the accus. case, in the passage of<br>\
the Kur cited above (xix. 70) makes it to be<br>\
governed by لَنَنْرِعَنَّ. (T.) Ks says, you say,<br>\
لَأَضْرِبَنَّ أَيَّهُمْ فِى الدَّارِ [I will assuredly beat him,<br>\
of them, or whichever of them, is in the house];<br>\
but you may not say, ضَرَبْتُ أَيَّهُمْ فِى الدَّارِ: thus<br>\
he distinguishes between the actual occurrence<br>\
and that which is expected. (S.) Akh says,<br>\
also, that it may be indeterminate and qualified<br>\
by an epithet; as when one says, مَرَرْتُ بِأَىٍّ<br>\
مُعْجِبٍ لَكَ, like as one says, بِمَنْ مُعْجِبٍ لَكَ [I<br>\
passed by one pleasing to thee]: but this has not<br>\
been heard [from the Arabs]. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b5-  It<br>\
also denotes perfection, or consummateness: and<br>\
in this case it is an epithet applying to an indeterminate noun; as in زَيْدٌ رَجُلٌ أَىُّ رَجُلٍ (tropical:) [Zeyd<br>\
is a man; what a man!], meaning that he is<br>\
complete, or consummate, in the qualities of men:<br>\
and it is a denotative of state relating to a determinate noun; as in مَرَرْتُ بِعَبْدِ اللّٰهِ أَىَّ رَجُلٍ (tropical:) [I<br>\
passed by &#39;Abd-Allah; what a man was he!]:<br>\
(Mughnee:) and used in this sense, it is tropical.<br>\
(Har p. 534.) [J says,] it is sometimes an epithet<br>\
applying to an indeterminate noun: you say,<br>\
مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ أَىِّ رَجُلٍ and أَيِّمَارَجُلٍ (assumed tropical:) [I passed by<br>\
a man; what a man!]; and مَرَرْتُ بِامْرَأَةٍ أَيَّةِ امْرَأَةٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:) [I passed by a woman; what a woman!], and<br>\
بِامْرَأَتَيْنِ أَيَّتِمَا امْرَأَتَيْنِ [by two women; what two<br>\
women!]; and هٰذِهِ امْرَأَةٌ أَيَّةُ امْرَأَةٍ (assumed tropical:) [This is<br>\
a woman; what a woman!]: and أَيَّتُمَا امْرَأَ أَيَّةُ امْرَأَةٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:) [What two women!]; ما being redundant: and<br>\
in the case of a determinate noun, you say, هٰذَا<br>\
زَيْدٌ أَيَّمَا رَجُلٍ (assumed tropical:) [This is Zeyd; what a man is<br>\
he!]; putting it in the accus. case as a denotative<br>\
of state; and هٰذِهِ أَمَةُ اللّٰهِ أَيَّتَمَا جَارِيّةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [This is<br>\
the handmaid of God; what a girl, or young<br>\
woman, is she!]: you say, also, [in using an indeterminate noun,] أَىُّ امْرَأَةٍ جَآءَتْكَ and جَآءَكَ,<br>\
and أَيَّةُ امْرَأَةٍ جَآءَتْكَ (assumed tropical:)  [What a woman came to<br>\
thee!]; and مَرَرْتُ بِجَارِيَةٍ أَىِّ جَارِيَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [I passed<br>\
by a girl, or young woman; what a girl, or<br>\
young woman!]; and جِئْتُكَ بِمُلَآءَةٍ أَىِّ مُلَآءَةٍ and<br>\
أَيَّةِ مُلَآءِةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [I brought thee a body-wrapper; what<br>\
a body-wrapper!]: all are allowable. (S.) [In<br>\
all these it evidently denotes admiration, or<br>\
wonder, at some good or extraordinary quality<br>\
in the person or thing to which it relates; notwithstanding that J says afterwards,] and sometimes it is used to denote wonder; as in the saying<br>\
of Jemeel,<br>\
بُثَيْنَ الْزَمِى لَا إَنَّ لَا إِنْ لَزِمْتِهِ<br>\
عَلَى كَثْرَةِ الوَاشِينَ أَىُّ مَعُونِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [O Butheyneh, (بُثَيْنَ being a curtailed form<br>\
of بُثَيْنَة, a woman&#39;s name,) adhere thou to “No:”<br>\
verily “No,” if thou adhere to it, notwithstanding the numbers of the slanderers, what a help<br>\
will it be!]: (S:) i. e., an excellent help will<br>\
be thy saying “No” in repelling, or rebutting,<br>\
the slanderers, though they be many. (TA in<br>\
art. عون.) Fr gives as exs. of its use to denote<br>\
wonder the sayings, أَىُّ رَجُلٍ زَيْدٌ [What a man<br>\
is Zeyd!], and أَىُّ جَارِيَهٍ زَيْنَبُ [What a girl, or<br>\
young woman, is Zeyneb!]. (T.) It denotes<br>\
wonder at the sufficiency, and great degree of<br>\
competence, of the person [or thing] to whom [or<br>\
to which] it relates. (M.) El-Kattál El-Kilábee<br>\
says,<br>\
وَلَمَّا رَأَيْتُ أَنَّنِى قَدْ قَتَلْتُهُ<br>\
نَدِمْتُ عَلَيْهِ أَىَّ سَاعَةِ مَنْدَمِ<br>\
[And when I saw that I had slain him, I repented<br>\
of it; in what an hour, or time, of repentance!]:<br>\
i. e., when I slew him, I repented of it, in a time<br>\
when repentance did not profit: اىّ being here in<br>\
the accus. case as an adv. n.; for, as it denotes<br>\
the part of a whole, its predicament is made to be<br>\
the same as that of the affixed noun, of whatever<br>\
kind this may be. (Ham p. 95.) ―<br>\
-b6-  It also has<br>\
ك prefixed to it; and thus it becomes changed<br>\
in signification so as to denote numerousness,<br>\
being syn. with the enunciative كَمْ [How many!];<br>\
(S, K;) or syn. with رُبَّ [as meaning many]:<br>\
(Sb, M:) [and sometimes it is syn. with the<br>\
interrogative كَمْ, meaning how many? or how<br>\
much? as will be shown below:] thus it is written<br>\
كَأَىٍّ, (M,) or كَأَيِّنْ, (S, M, K,) its tenween<br>\
being written ن; (S, K;) and كَآءٍ, (M,) or<br>\
[more commonly] كَائِنْ, (S, M, K, [in some<br>\
copies of the S and K كَايِنْ,]) like كَاعِنْ, (S,)<br>\
said by IJ, on the authority of Aboo-&#39;Alee, to be<br>\
formed from كَأَيِّنْ, by putting the double ى<br>\
before the ء, after the manner of the transposition<br>\
in قِسِىٌّ and a number of other words, so that it becomes كَيَّأٍ [or كَيَّئِنْ], then suppressing the second<br>\
ى, as is done in مَيِّتٌ and هَيِّنٌ and لَيِّنٌ, so that<br>\
it becomes كَىْءٍ [or كَىْءِنْ], and then changing<br>\
the [remaining] ى into ا, as in [طَيْئِىٌّ, which<br>\
becomes] طَادِىٌّ, and in [حِيرِىٌّ, which becomes]<br>\
حَارِىٌّ, so that it becomes كَآءٍ [or كَائِنْ]; (M;)<br>\
and it has other dial. vars.; namely كَيْئِنٌ [one<br>\
of the intermediate forms between كَأَيِّنْ and<br>\
كَائِنْ mentioned above]; (K; [in one copy of<br>\
the K written كَيَيِّنْ, and so accord. to the TK;])<br>\
and كَأْىٍ, (M, K,) of the measure of رَمْىٍ, and<br>\
most probably formed by transposition from كَىْءٍ,<br>\
mentioned above; (M;) and كَأ, of the measure<br>\
of عَمٍ, (M, TA,) incorrectly written in the copies<br>\
of the K كَاءٍ, i. e. like كَاعٍ, (TA,) formed by the<br>\
suppression of ى in كَىْءٍ; a change not greater<br>\
than that from أَيْمُنُ اللّٰهِ to مُ اللّٰهِ and مِ اللّٰهِ. (M.)<br>\
You say, كَأَيِّنْ رَجُلًا لَقِيتُ [How many a man<br>\
have I met! or many a man &amp;c.], (S, K, *)<br>\
putting the noun following كأيّن in the accus.<br>\
case as a specificative; (S;) and كَأَيِّنْ مِنْ رَجُلٍ<br>\
لَقِيتُ; (S, K; *) and the introduction of مِنْ after<br>\
كَأيّن is more common, and better. (S. [And Sb,<br>\
as cited in the M, says the like.]) You say also,<br>\
كَأَيِّنْ قَدْ أَتَانِى رَجُلًا [How many a man has come<br>\
to me! or many a man &amp;c.]. (Sb, M.) And بِكَأَيِّنْ<br>\
تَبِيعُ هٰذَا الثَّوْبَ, i. e. بِكَمْ تبيع [For how much<br>\
wilt thou sell this garment, or piece of cloth?].<br>\
(S.) Kh says that if any one of the Arabs made<br>\
it to govern the gen. case, perhaps he did so by<br>\
making مِنْ to be implied, as is allowable with<br>\
كَمْ: (M:) [so that you may say, بِكَأَيِّنْ دِرْهَمٍ<br>\
اشْتَرَيْتَ هٰذَا For how many a dirhem didst thou<br>\
buy this? for] it is allowable to make the noun<br>\
that follows كَمْ to be governed in the gen. case<br>\
by منْ implied, when كم immediately follows a<br>\
preposition; as in بِكضمْ دِرْهَمٍ اشْتَرَيْتَ هٰذَا; but<br>\
when it is not thus preceded by a preposition, the<br>\
noun after it must be in the accus. case. (I &#39;Ak<br>\
p. 317.) It always holds the first place in a<br>\
proposition, like كَمْ. (Idem, next p.) ―<br>\
-b7-  It is<br>\
also a connective of the vocative يَا with the noun<br>\
signifying the person or persons or thing called,<br>\
when this noun has the article ال prefixed to it;<br>\
(S, M, Mughnee, K;) and with a noun of indication, as ذَا; and with a conjunct noun having ال<br>\
prefixed to it, as الذِّى: (I &#39;Ak p. 268:) it is a<br>\
noun formed for serving as such a connective;<br>\
(M, K;) and has هَا affixed to it. (S, M, &amp;c.)<br>\
You say, يَا أَيُّهَا الرَّجُلُ [which seems to be best<br>\
rendered O thou man; more agreeably with the<br>\
original, O thou, the man; or, accord. to Akh,<br>\
O thou who art the man; lit., O he who is the<br>\
man; often written يَأَيُّهَا]; (T, S, M, Mughnee,<br>\
K;) and يَاأَيُّهَا الرَّجُلَانِ [O ye two men]; and<br>\
يَاأَيُّهَا الرِّجَالُ [O ye men]; (M;) and يَاأَيَّتُهَاالمَرْأَةُ<br>\
[O thou woman]; (S, M;) and يَا أَيَّتُهَا المَرْأَتَانِ<br>\
[O ye two women]; and أَيَّتُهَا النّسْوَةُ [O ye<br>\
women]; and يَاأَيُّهَا المَرْأَةُ, and المَرْأَتَانِ, and<br>\
النِّسْوَةُ; (M;) and يَاأَيُّهَا ذَا [O thou, this person<br>\
or thing]; and يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِى فَعَلَ كَذَا [O thou<br>\
who didst, or hast done, thus]. (I &#39;Ak p. 267.)<br>\
In the first of the exs. here given, أَىّ is a noun<br>\
of vague signification, (Zj, T, S,) denoting the<br>\
person called, (Zj, T,) of the sing. number, (Zj,<br>\
T, S,) rendered determinate by the vocative [يا],<br>\
(S,) indecl., with damm for its termination; (Zj,<br>\
T, S;) and هَا is a particle employed to rouse<br>\
attention, or to give notice, a substitute for the<br>\
noun to which أَىّ is in other cases prefixed; and<br>\
الرَّجُلُ is a qualificative to أَىّ, (Zj, T, S,) wherefore it is in the nom. case. (S.) Akh asserts, [as<br>\
we have indicated above,] that أَىّ is here the<br>\
conjunct noun, and that the first member of its<br>\
complement, namely the relative هُوَ, is suppressed;<br>\
the meaning being, يَا مَنْ هُوَ الرَّجُلُ: but this<br>\
assertion is refuted by the fact that there is no<br>\
relative pronoun that must be suppressed, nor any<br>\
conjunct noun that necessarily requires that its<br>\
complement should be a nominal proposition:<br>\
though he might reply to these two objections by<br>\
arguing that ما in the saying لَا سِيَّمَا زَيْدٌ is in like<br>\
manner [virtually] in the nom. case [as a conjunct<br>\
noun syn. with الَّذِى, and that the first member<br>\
of its complement, namely هُوَ, an inchoative of<br>\
which زَيْدٌ is the enunciative, is suppressed].<br>\
(Mughnee.) The putting of the qualificative of<br>\
أَىّ in the accus. case, as in the saying يَا أَيُّهَا الرَّجُلَ<br>\
أَقْبِلْ [O thou man, advance], is allowed (M, K)<br>\
by El-Mázinee; but it is not known [as heard<br>\
from the Arabs]. (M.) أَيُّهَا and أَيَّتُهَا are also<br>\
used for the purpose of particularizing; [in which<br>\
case they are not preceded by يا;] as when one<br>\
says, أَمَّا أَنَا فَأَفْعَلُ كَذَا أَيُّهَا الرَّجُلُ [As for me, I<br>\
will do thus, or such a thing, thou man], meaning<br>\
himself; and as in the saying of Kaab Ibn-Málik,<br>\
related in a trad., فَتَخَلَّفْنَا أَيَّتُهَا الثَّلَاثَهُ [And we<br>\
remained behind, or held back, ye three], meaning,<br>\
by the three, those particularized as remaining<br>\
behind [with him], or holding back. (TA.)<br>\
أَيَا: see art. ايا.<br>\
-A2-  أَيًا: see the next paragraph.<br>\
إِيَا الشَّمْسِ, [the former word, when alone and<br>\
indeterminate, perhaps (as when determinate)<br>\
without tenween, for it is-explained (with its dial.<br>\
vars.) in the S and K in باب الالف الليّنة, though<br>\
it is also explained in some copies of the S in<br>\
the present art.,] and الشمس ↓ أَيَاةُ, (T, S, M,<br>\
Mgh, K,) and الشمس ↓ أَيَاةُ, (S, M, K,) and ↓ أَيَآءُ<br>\
الشمس, (T, M, Mgh, K, and in a copy of the S,)<br>\
with fet-h and medd, (T, Mgh, K, and so in a<br>\
copy of the S,) The light of the sun, (S, M, Mgh,<br>\
K,) and its beauty: (M, K:) or its rays, and its<br>\
light: (T:) or, as some say, الشمس ↓ اياة signifies<br>\
the halo of the sun; that, with respect to the sun,<br>\
which is like the هَالَة with respect to the moon;<br>\
i. e. the دَارَة around the sun: (S:) the pl. [of<br>\
أَيَاةٌ] is ↓ أَيًا and إِيَآءٌ; [or rather the former is a<br>\
coll. gen. n.;] like أَكَمٌ and إِكَامٌ in relation to<br>\
أَكَمَةٌ. (M.) Tarafeh says, (T, S, Mgh,) describing the fore teeth (ثَغْر) of his beloved, (EM<br>\
p. 62,)<br>\
الشَّمْسِ إِلَّا لِثَاتِهِ ↓ سَقَتْهُ إِيَاةُ<br>\
[The light of the sun has shed its lustre upon<br>\
them, except their gums]. (T, S, Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
hence, by way of comparison, (M,) إِيَا النَّبَاتِ, and<br>\
↓ أَيَاؤُهُ, (M, K,) and ↓ إِيَاتُهُ, and ↓ أَيَاتُهُ, (K,)<br>\
(tropical:)  The beauty of herbage, (M, K,) and its blossoms, (M,) and brightness, (K, TA,) in its verdure and growth. (TA.)<br>\

إِيَّا: see art. ايا. [Az says,] I have not heard<br>\
any derivation of إِيَّا; but I think, without being<br>\
certain, that it is from تَآيَيْتُهُ as explained above;<br>\
as though it were a noun from that verb, of the<br>\
measure فِعْلَى, like ذِكْرَى from ذَكَرْتُ; so that<br>\
the meaning of إِيَّاكَ is I direct myself, or my<br>\
aim, to, or towards, thee, and thy person. (T.)<br>\
أَيِّىٌّ [a rel. n. of أَىٌّ]. When you ask a man<br>\
respecting his كُورَة [i. e. district, or city, or<br>\
town], you say, اَلْأَيِّىُّ [The person of what district, &amp;c., art thou?]; like as you say, in asking<br>\
him respecting his قَبِيلَة [or tribe], اَلْمَنِىُّ [from<br>\
مَنْ]: and you say also, أَيِّىٌّ أَنْتَ [A person of<br>\
what district, &amp;c., art thou?]; and مَنىٌّ<br>\
(T.) [See also مَنِىٌّ, in art. من.]<br>\
أَيَّانَ: see art. اين. Lth says that it is used in<br>\
the manner of مَتَى; [signifying When?]; and<br>\
that some say its ن is radical; others, that it is<br>\
augmentative: (T:) IJ says, it must be from أَىٌّ,<br>\
not from أَيْنَ, for two reasons: first, because أَيْنَ<br>\
denotes place; and أَيَّانَ, time: and secondly,<br>\
because nouns of the measure فَعَّال are few; and<br>\
those of the measure فَعْلَان, many: so that if you<br>\
name a man أَيَّان, it is imperfectly decl.: and he<br>\
adds, that أَىٌّ means a part of a whole; so that<br>\
it applies as properly to times as it does to other<br>\
things: (TA:) Fr says that it is originally أَىَّ أَوَانٍ<br>\
[at what time?]. (T.) One says, of a stupid, or<br>\
foolish, person, لَا يَعْرَفُ أَيَّانَ [He knows not<br>\
when]. (IB.)<br>\
آىْ: see أَىْ:<br>\

آيَةٌ A sign, token, or mark, by which a person<br>\
or thing is known; syn. عَلَامَةٌ (IAar, T, S, M,<br>\
Msb, K) and أَمَارَةٌ: (M, K:) it properly signifies<br>\
any apparent thing inseparable from a thing not<br>\
equally apparent, so that when one perceives the<br>\
former, he knows that he perceives the other,<br>\
which he cannot perceive by itself, when the two<br>\
things are of one predicament; and this is apparent in the object of sense and in that of the<br>\
intellect: (Er-Rághib, TA:) it is of the measure<br>\
فَعْلَةٌ, (M, K,) originally أَيَّةٌ; the [former] ى being<br>\
changed to ا because the letter before it is with<br>\
fet-h, though this is an extraordinary change:<br>\
(M:) this is related as on the authority of Sb:<br>\
(TA:) or it is of the measure فَعَلَةٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
accord. to Kh; (M;) originally أَوَيَةٌ; (S;) [for,<br>\
accord. to J and Fei,] Sb said that its medial<br>\
radical letter is و, and that the final is ى, because<br>\
words of this class are more common than those<br>\
of which the medial and final radical letters are<br>\
both ى; (S, Msb;) and the rel. n. is أَوَوِىُّ: (S:)<br>\
but IB says, Sb did not state that the medial<br>\
radical letter of آيَةٌ is و, as J states; but he said<br>\
that it is originally أَيَةٌ, and that the quiescent و<br>\
is changed into ا; and he relates of Kh, that he<br>\
allowed the rel. n. of آيَةٌ to be ↓ آئِىٌّ and ↓ آيِىٌّ and<br>\
آوِىٌّ; but as to أَوَوِىٌّ, he says, I know not any<br>\
one who has said it except J: (TA:) or it is<br>\
of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) originally آيَيَةٌ,<br>\
contracted by the suppression of its final radical<br>\
letter [with the preceding kesreh]: so accord. to<br>\
Fr: [but see what follows (after the pls.), where<br>\
this is said to be the opinion of Ks, and disallowed<br>\
by Fr:] (S, Msb:) the pl. is آيَاتٌ and ↓ آىٌ, (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K,) [or the latter is rather a coll. gen. n.,]<br>\
and pl. pl. آيَآءٌ: (M, K:) J says that one of its<br>\
pls. is آيَاىٌ; [and we find the same also in some<br>\
copies of the K;] but this is a mistake for آيَآءٌ,<br>\
which is pl. of آىٌ, not of آيَةٌ: (IB, TA:) and<br>\
this pl., being of the measure أَفْعَالٌ, has been<br>\
adduced as evidence that the medial radical letter<br>\
is ى, not و: (TA:) the dim. is ↓ إِيَيَّةٌ, [of the<br>\
measure فُعَيلَةٌ changed to فعَيْلَةٌ because of the<br>\
medial radical ى,] which, accord. to Fr, shows<br>\
the opinion of Ks, that آيَةٌ is of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ<br>\
rendered defective by the suppression of its final<br>\
radical letter, to be incorrect, because [Fr holds, in<br>\
opposition to some others, that] a noun of this measure has not its dim. formed on the measure فُعَيْلَةٌ<br>\
unless it is a proper name. (T.) They said,<br>\
اِفْعَلْهُ بِآيَةِ كَذَا [Do thou it at the sign of such a<br>\
thing]; like as you say, بِعَلَامَةِ كَذَا and بِأَمَارَةِ.<br>\
(M.) And [in this sense, as is indicated by the<br>\
context in the M,] it is one of the nouns that are<br>\
prefixed to verbs [as virtually governing the gen.<br>\
case], (M, K, *) because of the nearness of its<br>\
meaning to the meaning of time: (K:) as in the<br>\
saying [of a poet],<br>\
بِآيَةِ تُقْدِمُونَ الخَيْلَ شُعْثًا<br>\
[At the sign of your urging forward the horses,<br>\
unsmoothed in their coats, or not curried; which<br>\
means nearly the same as “at the time of your<br>\
urging” &amp;c.]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A sign as meaning an<br>\
indication, an evidence, or a proof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A<br>\
sign as meaning a miracle; [and a wonder; for]<br>\
آيَاتُ اللّٰهِ means the wonders of God. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
An example, or a warning; (Fr, T, M, Msb, K;)<br>\
as, for instance, the case of Joseph and his brethren, related in the Kur: (Fr, T:) pl. ↓ آىٌ (M,<br>\
K) and آيَاتٌ. (Fr, T.) ―<br>\
-b5-  A message, or communication sent from one person or party to another;<br>\
