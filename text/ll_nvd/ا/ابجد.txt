load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'ابجدأَبْجَدْ The first of a series of eight words comprising the letters of the Arabic alphabet [in the<br>\
order in which they were originally disposed,<br>\
agreeing with that of the Hebrew and Aramaic,<br>\
but with six additional letters: they are variously<br>\
written and pronounced; generally as follows:<br>\
أَبْجَدَ هَوَّزْ حُطِّى كَلَمَنْ سَعْفَصْ قَرَشَتْ ثَخَذْ ضَظَغْ:<br>\
but the Arabs of Western Africa write the latter<br>\
four thus: صعفض قرست ثخذ ظغش]: (K and<br>\
TA in art. بجد: [in both of which are related<br>\
several fables concerning the origin of these<br>\
words:]) accord. to the general opinion, the word<br>\
ابجد is of foreign origin, [like each of the words<br>\
following it,] and therefore its first letter [as well<br>\
as each of the others] is a radical. (TA.) [Hence,<br>\
الأَبْجَدُ signifies The alphabet. You say حُرُوفُ<br>\
الأَبْجَدِ The letters of the alphabet. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is probable (as De Sacy has observed in his Ar. Gram.,<br>\
2nd ed., i. 8,) that the Arabic alphabet originally<br>\
consisted of only twenty-two letters: for some of<br>\
the ancient Arabs called Saturday ابجد, Sunday<br>\
هوزّ, and so on to قرشت inclusive; calling Friday<br>\
عَرُوبَةُ. ―<br>\
-b3-  In the lexicon entitled “El-&#39;Eyn,” the<br>\
letters of the alphabet are arranged nearly according to their places of utterance; as follows:<br>\
ع, ح, ه, خ, غ, ق, ك, ج, ش, ض, ص, س, ز, ط,<br>\
د, ت, ظ, ذ, ث, ر, ل, ن, ف, ب, م, و, ا, ى:<br>\
and this order has been followed in the Tahdheeb<br>\
and Mohkam and some other lexicons.]<br>\
