أَنَّ, aor. يَئِنُّ, inf. n. أَنِينٌ and أُنَانٌ (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K) and تَأْنَانٌ (S, K) and أَنٌّ, (M, K,) He<br>\
moaned; or uttered a moan, or moaning, or prolonged voice of complaint; or said, Ah! syn.<br>\
تَأَوَّهَ; (M, K;) by reason of pain: (S, TA:) he<br>\
complained by reason of disease or pain: (TA:)<br>\
he uttered a cry or cries: (Msb:) said of a man.<br>\
(S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَنِّتِ القَوْسُ, aor. تَئِنُّ, inf. n. أَنِينٌ,<br>\
The bow made a gentle and prolonged sound.<br>\
(AHn, M.)<br>\
-A2-  لَا أَفْعَلُهُ مَا أَنَّ فِى السَّمَآءِ نَجْمٌ<br>\
means I will not do it as long as there is a star<br>\
in the heaven: (S, M, K:) أَنَّ being here a dial.<br>\
var. of عَنَّ. (S.) You say also, مَا أَنَّ فِي الفُرَاتِ<br>\
قَطْرَةٌ As long as there is a drop in the Euphrates.<br>\
(T, S.) And لَا أَفْعَلُهُ مَا أَنَّ فِى السَّمَآءٌ [I will<br>\
not do it as long as there is rain in the heaven].<br>\
(S.) [It is said in the M that Lh mentions the<br>\
last two sayings; but it is there indicated that he<br>\
read قَطْرَةً and سَمَآءً: and] ISk mentions the saying,<br>\
لَا أَفْعَلُهُ مَا أَنَّ فِى السَّمَآءِ نَجْمًا, (T, M,) and مَا عَنَّ<br>\
فِى السَّمَآءِ نَجْمٌ; (T;) [in the former of which,<br>\
أَنّ must be a particle (which see below); but it<br>\
seems that it should rather be إِنَّ, in this case, as<br>\
ISd thinks; for he says,] I know not for what<br>\
reason انّ is here with fet-h, unless a verb be<br>\
understood before it, as ثَبَتَ or وُجِدَ: [and he<br>\
adds,] Lh mentions مَا أَنَّ ذلِكَ الجَبَلَ مَكَانَهُ [as<br>\
long as that mountain is in its place]: and مَا أَنَّ<br>\
حِرَآءً مَكَانَهُ [as long as Mount Hirà is in its place]:<br>\
but he does not explain these sayings. (M.)<br>\
أَنٌ is a pronoun, denoting the speaker, [I, masc.<br>\
and fem.,] in the language of some of the Arabs:<br>\
they say, أَنْ فَعَلْتُ [I did], with the ن quiescent:<br>\
but most of them pronounce it [↓ أَنَ] with fet-h<br>\
when conjoined with a following word; (Mughnee, K;) saying, أَنَ فَعَلْتُ: (TA:) and [↓ أَنَا]<br>\
with ا in a case of pause: (Mughnee, K:) and<br>\
some pronounce it with ا also when it is conjoined<br>\
with a following word; saying, أَنَا فَعَلْتُ; [as we<br>\
generally find it written in books;] but this is of<br>\
a bad dialect: (TA:) [this last assertion, however,<br>\
requires consideration; for the dial. here said to<br>\
be bad is that of Temeem, accord. to what here<br>\
follows:] the Basrees hold that the pronoun consists of the ء and the ن, and that the [final] ا is<br>\
redundant, because it is suppressed in a case of<br>\
conjunction with a following word; but the<br>\
Koofees hold that the pronoun is composed of all<br>\
the three letters, because the ا is preserved in a<br>\
case of conjunction with a following word in the<br>\
dial. of Temeem. (Marginal note in a copy of<br>\
the Mughnee.) [Accord. to Az,] it is best to say<br>\
↓ أَنَا in a case of pause; and ↓ أَنَ in a case of<br>\
conjunction with a following word, as in أَنَ فَعَلْتُ<br>\
ذَاكَ [I did that]; but some of the Arabs say,<br>\
فَعَلْتُ ذَاكَ ↓ أَنَا; and some make the ن quiescent<br>\
in a case of this kind, though this is rare, saying,<br>\
أَنْ قُلْتُ ذَاكَ [I said that]; and Kudá&#39;ah prolong<br>\
the former ا, saying, قُلْتُهُ ↓ آنَ. (T.) [Accord. to<br>\
J,] ↓ أَنَا is a pronoun denoting the speaker alone,<br>\
and is made to end invariably with fet-h to distinguish it from the particle أَنْ which renders the<br>\
aor. mansoob; the final ا being for the purpose of<br>\
showing what is the vowel in a case of pause; but<br>\
when it occurs in the middle [or beginning] of a<br>\
sentence, it is dropped, except in a bad dialect.<br>\
(S.) [Accord. to ISd,] ↓ أَنَ is a noun denoting<br>\
the speaker; and in a case of pause, you add ا at<br>\
the end, [saying ↓ أَنَا,] to denote quiescence; (M;)<br>\
[or] it is better to do this, though it is not always<br>\
done: (TA:) but it is said, on the authority of<br>\
Ktr, that there are five dial. vars. of this word;<br>\
namely, فَعَلْتُ ↓ أَنَ, and ↓ أَنَا, and ↓ آنَ, and أَنٌ,<br>\
and ↓ أَنَهٌ, all mentioned by IJ; but there is some<br>\
weakness in this: IJ says that the ه in ↓ أَنَهٌ may<br>\
be a substitute for the ا in أَنَا, because the latter<br>\
is the more usual, and the former is rare;<br>\
or it may be added to show what is the vowel,<br>\
like the ه, and be like the ه in كِتَابِيَهْ and<br>\
حِسَابِيَهٌ. (M.) For the dual, as well as the pl.,<br>\
only نَحْنُ is used. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also a<br>\
pronoun denoting the person addressed, or spoken<br>\
to, by assuming the form ↓ أَنْتَ [Thou, masc.];<br>\
ت being added to it as the sign of the person<br>\
addressed, (S, M, Mughnee, K,) and أَنْ being<br>\
the pronoun, (M, Mughnee, K,) accord. to the<br>\
general opinion; (Mughnee, K;) the two becoming as one; not that one is prefixed to the<br>\
other as governing it in the gen. case: (S:) and<br>\
so ↓ أَنْتِ, (S, M, Mughnee, K,) addressed to the<br>\
female: (S, M:) and ↓ أَنْتُمَا, (M, Mughnee, K,)<br>\
addressed to two; not a regular dual, for were it<br>\
so it would be أَنْتَان; but like كُمَا in ضَرَبْتُكُمَا:<br>\
(M:) and ↓ أَنْتُمٌ and ↓ أَنْتُنَّ, (S, Mughnee, K,)<br>\
which are [respectively] the masc. and fem. pls.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  To each of these the ك of comparison is<br>\
sometimes prefixed; so that you say, ↓ أَنْتَ كَأَنَا<br>\
[Thou art like me, or as I], and ↓ أَنَا كَأَنْتَ [or<br>\
أَنَ كَأَنْتَ I am like thee, or as thou]; as is<br>\
related on the authority of the Arabs; for though<br>\
the ك of comparison is not prefixed to the [affixed]<br>\
pronoun, and you say, أَنْتَ كَزَيْدٍ but not أَنْتَ كِي,<br>\
yet the separate pronoun is regarded by them as<br>\
being in the same predicament as the noun; and<br>\
therefore the prefixing it to the latter kind of<br>\
pronoun is approved. (S.) It is said in the Book<br>\
of لَيْسَ, by IKh, that there is no such phrase, in<br>\
the language of the Arabs, as أَنْتَ كِى, nor as<br>\
أَنَا كَكَ, except in two forged verses; wherefore<br>\
Sb says that the Arabs, by saying أَنْتَ مِثْلِى and<br>\
أَنَا مثْلُكَ, have no need of saying أَنْتَ كِى and<br>\
أَنَا كَكَ: and the two verses are these:<br>\
وَلَوْلَا البَلَآءُ لَكَانُوا كَنَا  فَلَوْلَا الحَيَآإُ لَكُنَّا كَهُمٌ<br>\
[And but for the sense of shame, we had been like<br>\
them, or as they: and but for trial, or affliction,<br>\
they had been like us, or as we]: and<br>\
إِنْ تَكُنْ كِى فِإِنَّنِي كَكَ فِيهَا<br>\
إِنَّنَا فِى المَلَامِ مُصْطَحِبَانِ<br>\
[If thou art like me, or as I, verily I am like<br>\
thee, or as thou, in respect of her, or it, or them:<br>\
verily we, in respect of blame, are companions].<br>\
(TA.) Az mentions his having heard some of the<br>\
Benoo-Suleym say, كَمَا أَنْتَنِي, [the latter word<br>\
being a compound of the pronoun أَنْتَ, regularly<br>\
written separately, and the affixed pronoun نِى,]<br>\
meaning Wait thou for me in thy place. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also a particle: and as such, it is—First,<br>\
a particle of the kind called مَصْدَرِىٌّ, rendering<br>\
the aor. mansoob: (Mughnee, K:) i. e., (TA,)<br>\
it combines with a verb [in this case] in the future<br>\
[or aor.] tense, following it, to form an equivalent<br>\
to an inf. n., and renders it mansoob: (S, TA:)<br>\
you say, أُرِيدُ أَنْ تَقُومَ [I desire that thou stand,<br>\
or that thou wouldst stand, or that thou mayest<br>\
stand]; meaning أُرِيدُ قِيَامَكَ [I desire thy standing]. (S.) It occurs in two places: first, in that<br>\
of the inchoative, or in the beginning of a phrase,<br>\
so that it is in the place of a nom. case; as in the<br>\
saying [in the Kur ii. 180], وَأَنْ تَصُومُوا خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ<br>\
[And that ye fast is better for you]; (Mughnee,<br>\
K;) i. e. صِيَامُكُمْ [your fasting]. (TA.) And,<br>\
secondly, after a word denoting a meaning which<br>\
is not that of certainty: and thus it is the place<br>\
of a nom. case; as in the saying [in the Kur<br>\
lvii. 15], أَلَمْ يَأَنِ لِلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنٌ تَخْشَعَ قُلُوبُهُمْ<br>\
[Hath not the time that their hearts should become submissive, i. e. the time of their hearts&#39;<br>\
becoming submissive, yet come unto those who have<br>\
believed?]: and in the place of an accus. case; as<br>\
in the saying [in the Kur x. 38], وَمَا كَانَ هذَا<br>\
القْرْآنُ أَنْ يُفْتَرَء [And this Kur-án is not such<br>\
that it might be forged; i. e., افُتِرِآءٌ; so in Bd<br>\
and Jel; and so in a marginal note to a copy of<br>\
the Mughnee, where is added, meaning مُفْتَرًى<br>\
forged]: and in the place of a gen. case; as in<br>\
the saying [in the Kur lxiii. 10], مِنْ قَبْلِ أَنْ يَأْتِىَ<br>\
أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ [Before that death come unto any<br>\
one of you; i. e. before death&#39;s coming unto any<br>\
one of you]. (Mughnee, K.) Sometimes it makes<br>\
the aor. to be of the mejzoom form, (Mughnee,<br>\
K,) as some of the Koofees and AO have mentioned, and as Lh has stated on the authority of<br>\
certain of the Benoo-Sabbáh of Dabbeh; (Mughnee;) as in this verse:<br>\
إِذَا مَا غَدَوْنَا قَالَ وِلْدَانُ أَهْلِنَا<br>\
تَعَالوْغا إِلَى أَنْ يَأْتِنَا الصَّيْدُ نَحْطِبِ<br>\
[When we went away in the morning, the youths<br>\
of our family, or people, said, Come ye, until that<br>\
the chase come to us, (i. e. until the coming of the<br>\
chase to us,) let us collect firewood]. (Mughnee,<br>\
K.) And sometimes it is followed by an aor. of<br>\
the marfooa form; as in the saying [in the Kur<br>\
ii. 233], accord. to the reading of Ibn-Moheysin,<br>\
لِمَنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يُتِمُّ الرَّضَاعَةَ [For him who desireth<br>\
that he may complete the time of sucking; i. e. the<br>\
completing thereof]; (Mughnee, K;) but this is<br>\
anomalous, (I &#39;Ak p. 101, and TA,) or أَنْ is here<br>\
a contraction of أَنَّ [for أَنَّهُ]: (I &#39;Ak:) and in the<br>\
saying of the poet,<br>\
أَنْ تَقَرَآنِ عَلَي أَسْمَآءِ وَيْحَكُمَا<br>\
مِنِّى السَّلَامَ وَأَنْ لَا تُخْبِرَا أَحَدَا<br>\
[That ye two convey, or communicate, to Asmà,<br>\
(mercy on you! or woe to you!) from me, salutation, and that ye inform not any one]; but the<br>\
Koofees assert that أَنٌ is here [in the beginning<br>\
of the verse] a contraction of أَنَّ, and anomalously<br>\
conjoined with the verb; whereas the Basrees<br>\
correctly say that it is أَنٌ which renders the aor.<br>\
mansoob, but is deprived of government by its<br>\
being made to accord with its co-ordinate مَا,<br>\
termed مَصْدَرِيَّة; (Mughnee;) or, as IJ says, on<br>\
the authority of Aboo-&#39;Alee, أَنٌ is here used by<br>\
poetic licence for أَنَّكُمَا; and the opinion of the<br>\
Baghdádees [and Basrees], that it is likened to<br>\
مَا, and therefore without government, is improbable, because أَنْ is not conjoined with a verb in<br>\
the present tense, but only with the preterite and<br>\
the future. (M.) When it is suppressed, the aor.<br>\
may be either mansoob or marfooa; but the latter<br>\
is the better; as in the saying in the Kur<br>\
[xxxix. 64], أَفَغَيْرَ اللّٰهِ تَأْمُرُونِّى أَعْبُدُ [Other than<br>\
God do ye bid me worship?]. (S.) If it occurs<br>\
immediately before a preterite, it combines with<br>\
it to form an equivalent to an inf. n. relating to<br>\
past time; being in this case without government:<br>\
you say, أَعْجَيَنِيأَنْ قُمْتَ [It pleased me that<br>\
thou stoodest]; meaning thy standing that is past<br>\
pleased me: (S:) and thus it is used in the saying<br>\
[in the Kur xxviii. 82], لَوْلَا أَنٌ مَنَّ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْنَا<br>\
[Were it not for that God conferred favour upon<br>\
us; i. e., for God&#39;s having conferred favour upon<br>\
us]. (Mughnee.) It is also conjoined with an<br>\
imperative; as in the phrase mentioned by Sb,<br>\
كَتَبْتُ إِلَيهِ بِأَنة قُمٌ [I wrote to him, Stand; i. e.<br>\
I wrote to him the command to stand]; which<br>\
shows that AHei is wrong in asserting that whenever it is conjoined with an imperative it is an<br>\
explicative [in the sense of أَيٌ], and that in this<br>\
particular instance the ب may be redundant,<br>\
which it cannot here be, because, whether redundant or not, it is not put immediately before<br>\
anything but a noun or what may be rendered by<br>\
a noun. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Secondly, it is a con-<br>\
traction of أَنَّ; (Mughnee, K;) and occurs after<br>\
a verb denoting certainty, or one used in a manner<br>\
similar to that of such a verb: (Mughnee:) so in<br>\
the saying [in the Kur lxxiii. 20], عَلِمَ أَنٌ سَيَكُونُ<br>\
مِنْكُمٌ مَرْضَي [He knoweth that (the case will be<br>\
this:) there will be among you some diseased; the<br>\
affixed pronoun هُ, meaning اشَّأْنَ, being understood after أَنْ, which therefore stands for أَنَّهُ, i. e.<br>\
أَنَّ الشَّأْنَ]: (Mughnee, K: *) and in the phrase,<br>\
بَلَغَنِى أَنْ قَدْ كَانَ كَذَا وكَذَا [It has come to my<br>\
knowledge, or been related to me, or been told to<br>\
me, or it came to my knowledge, &amp;c., that (the<br>\
case is this:) such and such things have been]; a<br>\
phrase of this kind, in which أَنْ occurs with a<br>\
verb, not being approved without قَدْ, unless you<br>\
say, بَلَغَنِى أَنَّهُ كَانَ كَذَا وَكَذَا: (Lth, T:) [for]<br>\
when the contracted أَنْ has for its predicate a<br>\
verbal proposition, of which the verb is neither<br>\
imperfectly inflected, like لَيْسَ and عَسَى, nor<br>\
expressive of a prayer or an imprecation, it is<br>\
separated from the verb, according to the more<br>\
approved usage, by قَدْ, or the prefix سَ, or سَوْفَ,<br>\
or a negative, as لَا &amp;c., or لَوْ: (I &#39;Ak pp. 100<br>\
and 101:) but when its predicate is a nominal<br>\
proposition, it requires not a separation; so that<br>\
you say, CCC عَلِمْتُ أَنْ زِيْدٌ قَائِمٌ [I knew that (the<br>\
case was this:) Zeyd was standing]; (I &#39;Ak p. 100;)<br>\
and بَلَغَنِى أَنْ زَيدٌ خَارِجٌ [It has come to my<br>\
knowledge, or been related to me, or been told to<br>\
me, &amp;c., that (the case is this:) Zeyd is going, or<br>\
coming, out, or forth]; (TA;) except in the case<br>\
of a negation, as in the saying in the Kur [xi. 17],<br>\
وأَنْ لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا هُوَ [And that (the case is this:)<br>\
there is no deity but He]. (I &#39;Ak p. 100.) Thus<br>\
used, it is originally triliteral, and is also what is<br>\
termed مَصْدَرِيَّة; [عَلِمَ أَنْ, in the first of the exs.<br>\
above, for instance, meaning عَلِمَ أَنَّهُ, i. e. عَلِمَ أَنَّ<br>\
الشَّأْنَ, which is equivalent to عَلِمَ كَوْنَ الشَّأْنِ;]<br>\
and governs the subject in the accus. case, and<br>\
the predicate in the nom. case: and its subject<br>\
must be a pronoun, suppressed, [as in the exs.<br>\
given above, where it means الشَّأْنِ, and in a verse<br>\
cited before, commencing أَنْ تَقْرَآنِ, accord. to<br>\
A&#39;boo-&#39;Alee,] or expressed; the latter, accord. to<br>\
the more correct opinion, being allowable only by<br>\
poetic license: and its predicate must be a proposition, unless the subject is expressed, in which<br>\
case it may be either a single word or a proposition; both of which kinds occur in the following<br>\
saying [of a poet]:<br>\
بِأَنْكَ رَبِيعٌ وغَيْثٌ مَرِيعٌ<br>\
وَأَنْكَ هُنَاكَ تَكُونَ الثِّمَالَا<br>\
[he is speaking of persons coming as guests to<br>\
him whom he addresses, when their provisions<br>\
are exhausted, and the horizon is dust-coloured,<br>\
and the north wind is blowing, (as is shown by<br>\
the citation of the verse immediately preceding,<br>\
in the T,) and he says, They know that thou art<br>\
like rain that produces spring-herbage, and like<br>\
plenteous rain, and that thou, there, art the aider<br>\
and the manager of the affairs of people]. (Mughnee. [In the T, for رَبِيعٌ, I find الَّربِيعُ; and for<br>\
وَأَنْكَ, I there find وَقِدْمًا: but the reading in the<br>\
Mughnee is that which is the more known.])<br>\
[J says,] أَنْ is sometimes a contraction of أَنَّ<br>\
and does not govern [anything]: you say, بَلَغَنِى<br>\
أَنٌ زَيْدٌ خَارِجٌ [explained above]; and it is said<br>\
in the Kur [vii. 41], وَنُودُوا أَنْ تِلْكُمُ الجَنَّةُ [And<br>\
it shall be proclaimed to them that (the case is<br>\
this:) that is Paradise]: (S:) [here, however,<br>\
أَنة is regarded by some as an explicative, as will<br>\
be seen below:] but in saying this, J means<br>\
that it does not govern as to the letter; for<br>\
virtually it does govern; its subject being meant<br>\
to be understood; the virtual meaning being<br>\
أَنَّهُ تِلْكُمُ الجَنَّةُ. (IB.) [In another place, J says,]<br>\
You may make the contracted أَنْ to govern or<br>\
not, as you please. (S.) Aboo-Tálib the Grammarian mentions an assertion that the Arabs<br>\
make it to govern; as in the saying [of a poet,<br>\
describing a beautiful bosom],<br>\
كَأَنْ ثَذْيَيْهِ حُقَّانِ<br>\
[As though its two breasts were two small round<br>\
boxes]: but [the reading commonly known is<br>\
كَأَنْ ثَدْيَاهُ حُقَّانِ<br>\
(this latter reading is given in De Sacy&#39;s Anthol.<br>\
Gram. Ar. p. 104 of the Ar. text; and both are<br>\
given in the S;) كَأَنْ here meaning كَأَنَّهُ; and]<br>\
Fr says, We have not heard the Arabs use the<br>\
contracted form and make it to govern except<br>\
with a pronoun, in which case the desinential<br>\
syntax is not apparent. (T.) The author of the<br>\
K says in the B that you say, عَلِمْتُ أَنْ زيْدًا<br>\
لَمُنْطَلِقٌ [I knew that Zeyd was indeed going<br>\
away], with ل when it is made to govern; and<br>\
عَلِمْتُ أَنْ زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ [I knew that (the case was<br>\
this:) Zeyd was going away], without ل when it<br>\
is made to have no government. (TA. [But in the<br>\
latter ex. it governs the subject, which is understood, as in other exs. before given.]) [See an ex.<br>\
in a verse ending with the phrase وَكَأَنْ قَدِ cited<br>\
voce قَد, where كَأَنْ is for كَأَنَّهُ, meaning كَأَنَّ<br>\
الشّأنَ, and a verb is understood after قد. And<br>\
see also أَنَّ, below.]―<br>\
-b2- Thirdly, it is an explicative, (Mughnee, K,) meaning أَيْ (S, M, and<br>\
so in some copies of the K,) or [rather] used<br>\
in the manner of أَيْ; (Mughnee, and so in some<br>\
copies of the K;) [meaning قَائِلًا, or قَائِلِينَ;<br>\
or يَقُولُ, or يَقُولُونَ; or some other form of the<br>\
verb قَالَ; i. e. Saying ; &amp;c.;] as in the saying<br>\
[in the Kur xxiii. 27], فَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْهِ أَنِ اصْنَعِ الْقُلْكَ<br>\
[And we revealed, or spake by revelation, unto<br>\
him, saying, Make thou the ark]; (Mughnee,<br>\
K) and [in the Kur vii. 41,]وَنُودُوا أَنْ تِلْكُمُ<br>\
الْجَنَّةُ [And it shall be proclaimed to them, being<br>\
said, That is Paradise]; or in these two instances<br>\
it may be regarded as what is termed مَصْدَرِيَّة,<br>\
by supposing the preposition [بِ] understood<br>\
before it, so that in the former instance it is the<br>\
biliteral, because it is put before the imperative,<br>\
and in the second it is the contraction of أَنَّ<br>\
because it is put before a nominal proposition;<br>\
(Mughnee;) and [in the Kur xxxviii. 5,] وَانْطَلَقَ<br>\
الْمَلَأُ مِنْهُمْ أَنِ امْشُوا(S, M, Mughnee) i. e. [And<br>\
the chief persons of them] broke forth, or launched<br>\
forth, with their tongues, or in speech, [saying,]<br>\
Go ye on, or continue ye, in your course of action<br>\
&amp;c. (Mughnee.) For this usage of أَنْ certain<br>\
conditions are requisite : first, that it be preceded<br>\
by a proposition : secondly, that it be followed<br>\
by a proposition; so that you may not say, ذَكَرْتُ<br>\
عَسْجَدًا أَنْ ذَهَبًا, but you must say أَىٌ in this<br>\
case, or must omit the explicative : thirdly, that<br>\
the preceding proposition convey the meaning of<br>\
القَوْلُ, as in the exs. above; in the last of which,<br>\
انطلق has the meaning assigned to it above; not<br>\
that of walking or going away : fourthly, that there<br>\
be not in the preceding proposition the letters of<br>\
القَوْلُ; so that one may not say, قُلْتُ لَهُ أَنِ افْعَلْ;<br>\
or, if there be in it those letters, that the word<br>\
which they compose shall be interpreted by<br>\
another word; as in the saying, in the Kur<br>\
[v, 117], مَا قُلْتُ لَهُمْ إِلَّا مَا أَمَرْتَنِى بِهِ أَنِ اعْبُدُوا اللّٰهَ<br>\
which may mean, as Z says,  I have not commanded them [aught save that which Thou commandedst me, saying, Worship ye God]; (Mughnee;) in which instance Fr says that it is an<br>\
explicative : (T :) fifthly, that there be not a preposition immediately before it; for if you say,<br>\
كَتَبْتُ إِلَيْهِ بِأَنِ افْعَلْ كَذَا, it is what is termed<br>\
مَصْدَرِيَّة [as we have before shown]. (Mughnee.)<br>\
When it may be regarded as an explicative and<br>\
is followed by an aor. with لا as in أَشَرْتُ إِلَيْهِ أَنْ<br>\
لَا تَفْعَل كَذَا, it may be marfooa, [namely, the<br>\
aor.,] on the supposition that لا is a negative ;<br>\
or mejzoom, on the supposition that it is a prohibitive; and in both cases ان is an explicative ;<br>\
[so that the meaning is, I made a sign to him,<br>\
as though saying, Thou wilt not do such a thing,<br>\
in the former case ; or, in the latter, Do not thou<br>\
such a thing ;] or mansoob, on the supposition<br>\
that لا is a negative and that ان is what is termed<br>\
مَصْدَرِيَّة: but if لا is wanting, it may not be<br>\
mejzoom, but may be marfooa [if we use ان as<br>\
an explicative] or mansoob [if ان be what is<br>\
termed مَصْدَرِيَّة]. (Mughnee.)―<br>\
-b3-  Fourthly, it is<br>\
redundant, as a corroborative, (Mughnee, K,)<br>\
like whatever else is redundant : and thus it is<br>\
in four cases : one of these, which is the most<br>\
common, being when it occurs after لَمَّا denoting<br>\
time; [and this is mentioned in the M ; ] as in<br>\
the saying [in the Kur xxix. 32], وَلمَّا أَنْ جَآءَ تْ<br>\
رُسُلُنَا لُوطًا [And when our apostles came to Lot]:<br>\
(Mughnee:) [or,] accord. to J, (TA,) it is sometimes a connective to لَمَّا; as in the saying in the<br>\
Kur [xii. 96], فَلَمَّا أَنْ جَآءَ الْبَشِيرُ [And when that<br>\
(like as we say, &quot; now that,&quot;) the announcer of<br>\
good tidings came] : and sometimes it is redundant ; as in the saying in the Kur [viii. 34],<br>\
وَمَا لَهُمْ أَنْ لَا يُعَذِبَهُمُ اللّٰهُ [as though it might<br>\
be rendered But what reason have they, God<br>\
should not punish them?] : (S, TA:) but IB<br>\
says that the connective is redundant ; and [that<br>\
ان is not redundant in the latter instance, for]<br>\
if it were redundant in this verse of the Kur it<br>\
would not render the [aor.] verb mansoob. (TA.<br>\
[The author of the Mughnee, like IB, disallows<br>\
that ان is redundant in a case of this kind, which<br>\
Kh asserts it to be ; and says that فِى is under-<br>\
stood before it.]) The second case is when it<br>\
occurs between لَوٌ and a verb signifying swearing,<br>\
the latter being expressed; as in this verse:<br>\
فَأُقْسِمُ أَنْ لَوِ الْتَقَيْنَا وَأَنْتُمُ<br>\
لَكَانَ لَنَا يَوْمٌ مِنَ الشَّرِّ مُظْلِمُ<br>\
[And I swear, had we and you met, there had<br>\
been to us a dark day of evil]: and when that<br>\
verb is omitted; as in the following ex.:<br>\
أَمَا وَاللّٰهِ أَنْ لَوْ كُنْتَ حُرِّا<br>\
وَمَا بِالْحُِرِأَنْتَ وَلَا العَتِيقِ<br>\
[Verily, or now surely, by God, if thou wert<br>\
freeborn; but thou art not the freeborn nor the<br>\
emancipated]: so say Sb and others: Ibn-&#39;Os-<br>\
foor holds it to be a particle employed to connect<br>\
the complement of the oath with the oath; but<br>\
this is rendered improbable by the fact that it<br>\
is in most cases omitted, and such particles are<br>\
not. (Mughnee.) The third case, which is extr.,<br>\
is when it occurs between the ك [of comparison]<br>\
and the noun governed by it in the genitive case;<br>\
as in the saying,<br>\
وَيَوْمًا تُوَافِينَا بِوَجْهٍ مُقَسَّمٍ<br>\
كَأَنٌ ظَبْيَةٍ تَعْطُو إِلَى وَارِقِ السَّلَمْ<br>\
[And on a day thou comest to us with a beautiful face, like a doe-gazelle raising her head<br>\
towards the goodly green-leaved tree of the selem<br>\
kind], accord. to the reading of him who makes<br>\
طبيةْ to be governed in the genitive case [instead<br>\
of the accus. or the nom.; for if we read it in<br>\
the accus. or the nom., أَنْ is a contraction of أَنَّ;<br>\
in the former case, ظبية being its subject, and its<br>\
predicate being suppressed; and in the latter case,<br>\
the meaning being كَأَنَّهَا ظَبْيَةٌ, so that the subject<br>\
of ان is suppressed]. (Mughnee.) The fourth<br>\
case is when it occurs after إِذَا; as in the following ex.:<br>\
فَأُمْهلُهُ حَتَّى إذَا أَنْ كَأَنَّهُ<br>\
مُعَاطِى يَدٍ فِي لُجَّةِ المَآءِ غَامِرُ<br>\
[And I leave him alone until when he is as though<br>\
he were a giver of a hand to be laid hold upon,<br>\
in the fathomless deep of the water immerged].<br>\
(Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Fifthly,] among other meanings<br>\
which have been assigned to it, (Mughnee,) it<br>\
has a conditional meaning, like إِنٌ: (Mughnee,<br>\
K:) so the Koofees hold; and it seems to be<br>\
most probably correct, for several reasons: first,<br>\
because both these forms occur, accord. to different readings, in several instances, in one<br>\
passage of the Kur; as in [ii. 282,] أَنْ تَضِلٌّ<br>\
إِحْدَاهُمَا [If one of them twain (namely, women,)<br>\
err]; &amp;c.: secondly, because [the prefix] فَ<br>\
often occurs after it; as in a verse commencing<br>\
with أَبَا خُرَاشَةَ [as cited voce أَمَّا, accord. to some<br>\
who hold that أمَّا in that verse is a compound<br>\
of the conditional أَنْ and the redundant مَا; and<br>\
as in the Kur ii. 282, where the words quoted<br>\
above are immediately followed by فَتُذَكِّرَ إِحْدَاهُمَا<br>\
الْأُخْرَى]: thirdly, because it is conjoined with<br>\
إِنٌ [which forms a part of the compound إِكَّا]<br>\
in this ex.:<br>\
إِمَّا أَقَمْتَ وَأَمَّا أَنْتَ مُرْتَحِلًا<br>\
فَاللّٰهُ يَكْلَأُ مَا تَأْتِى وَمَا تَذَرُ<br>\
[If thou remain, and if thou be going away (أَمَّا<br>\
meaning أَنْ كُنْتَ, as syn. with إِنْ كُنْتَ), may<br>\
God guard thee (يَكْلَأُ being marfooa because of<br>\
the ف) as long as thou doest and as long as thou<br>\
leavest undone]: thus related, with kesr to the<br>\
former ان [in إِنَّا] and with fet-h to the latter<br>\
[in أَمَّا]. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Sixthly,] it is a negative, like إِنْ: (Mughnee, K:) so, as some say,<br>\
in [the Kur iii. 66,] أَنع يُؤْتَى أَحَدٌ مِثْلَ مَا أُوتِيتُمْ<br>\
[meaning accord. to them Not any one is given<br>\
the like of that scripture which ye have been<br>\
given]: but it is said [by others] that the meaning is, [taken with what precedes it,] And believe<br>\
not ye that (بِأَنْ) any one is given the like of<br>\
that scripture which ye have been given, except<br>\
it be given to him who followeth your religion;<br>\
and that the phrase “ say thou, Verily the direction is the direction of God,” is parenthetic.<br>\
(Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [Seventhly,] it is syn. with إِذْ,<br>\
(AZ, T, Mughnee, K, [in Freytag&#39;s Lex., from<br>\
the K, إِذْ قِيلَ, but قيل in the K relates to what<br>\
there follows,]) as some say, in [the Kur l. 2,]<br>\
بَلْ عَجِبُوا أَنٌ جَآءَهُمْ مُنْذِرٌمِنْهُمْ [Verily they wonder<br>\
because a warner from among themselves hath<br>\
come unto them]; (Mughnee, K;) and in other<br>\
instances; but correctly, in all these instances,<br>\
ان is what is termed مَصْدَرِيَّة, and لِ denoting<br>\
cause is understood before it. (Mughnee.) [See<br>\
also أَمَّا and إِمَّا.] ―<br>\
-b7-  [Eighthly,] it is syn. with<br>\
لِئَلّا, accord. to some, in [the Kur iv. last verse,]<br>\
يُبَيِّنُ اللّٰهُأَنْ تَضِلُّوا [God explaineth to you<br>\
(the ordinances of your religion, Jel), lest ye<br>\
should err, or in order that ye may not err];<br>\
(Mughnee, K;) and in the saying,<br>\
نَزَلْتُمْ مَنْزِلَ الأَضْيَافِ مِنَّا<br>\
فَعَجَّلْنَا القِرَى أَنْ تَشْتِمُونَا<br>\
[Ye became, or have become, in the condition of<br>\
our guests; so we hastened, or have hastened,<br>\
the entertainment, lest ye should revile us, or in<br>\
order that ye should not revile us]: (Mughnee:)<br>\
but correctly, in such a case [likewise], ان is<br>\
what is termed مَصْدَرِيَّة, and the original wording<br>\
is كَرَاهَةَ أَنْ تَضِلُّوا [from a motive of dislike that<br>\
ye should err], (Mughnee, K,) and مَخَافَةَ أَنْ<br>\
تَشْتِمُونَا [from a motive of fear that ye should<br>\
revile us]: so say the Basrees: some say, extravagantly, that ل is meant to be understood before<br>\
it, and الَّذِى after it. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b8-  [Ninthly,] it<br>\
occurs in the sense of الَّذِى; as in the saying,<br>\
زَيْدٌ أَعْقَلُ مِنٌ أَنْ يَكْذِب [Zeyd is more reasonable<br>\
than he who lies; which is equivalent to saying,<br>\
Zeyd is too reasonable to lie: but respecting its<br>\
usage in a phrase of this kind, and respecting the<br>\
form of the aor. after it in such a case, see مِنْ].<br>\
(Kull p. 78.) ―<br>\
-b9-  By a peculiarity of pronunciation<br>\
termed عَنْعَتَةٌ, the tribe of Temeem say عَنْ instead<br>\
of أَنٌ. (M.)<br>\
إِنٌ is used in various ways: first, as a conditional particle, (S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) denoting<br>\
the happening of the second of two events in consequence of the happening of the first, (S, Msb, *)<br>\
whether the second be immediate or deferred, and<br>\
whether the condition be affirmative or negative;<br>\
(Msb;) [and as such it is followed by a mejzoom<br>\
aor., or by a pret. having the signification of an<br>\
aor.;] as in the saying, [إِنْ تَفْعَلٌ أفْعَلٌ If thou<br>\
do such a thing, I will do it; and] إِنْ تَأْتِنِى آتِكَ<br>\
[If thou come to me, I will come to thee]; and<br>\
إِنٌ جِئْتَنِى أَكْرَمْتُكَ [If thou come to me, I will<br>\
treat thee with honour]; (S;) and إِنْ فَعَلْتَ فَعَلْتُ<br>\
[If thou do, I will do] for which the tribe of<br>\
Teiyi say, as IJ relates on the authority of Ktr,<br>\
هِنْ فَعَلْتَ فَعَلْتُ; (M;) and إِنْ دَخَلْت الدَّارَ أَوٌ [If<br>\
thou stand, I will stand]; and إِنْ دَخَلْتِ الدَّارَ أَوْ<br>\
لَمْ تَدْخُلِى الدَّارض فَأَنْتِ طَالقٌ [If thou enter the<br>\
house, or if thou enter not the house, thou shalt<br>\
be divorced]; (Msb;) and [in the Kur viii. 39,]<br>\
إِنْ يَنْتَهُوا يُغْفَرٌ لَهُمْ مَا قَد سَلَفَ [If they desist,<br>\
what hath already past shall be forgiven them];<br>\
and [in verse 19 of the same ch.,] وَإِنْ تَعُودُوا نَعُدْ<br>\
[But if ye return to attacking the Apostle, we<br>\
will return to assisting him]. (Mughnee, K.)<br>\
[On the difference between it and إِذا, see the<br>\
latter.] When either it or إِذَا is immediately<br>\
followed by a noun in the nom. case, the said<br>\
noun is governed in that case by a verb necessarily suppressed, of which it is the agent; as<br>\
in the saying, in the Kur [ix. 6], وَإِنْ أَحَدٌ مِنَ<br>\
الْمُشْرِكِينَ استَجَارَكَ; the complete phrase being وَإِنِ<br>\
اسْتَجَارَكَ أَحَدٌ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ اسْتَجَارَكَ [And if<br>\
any one of the believers in a plurality of gods<br>\
demand protection of thee, (if) he demand protection of thee]: so accord. to the generality of the<br>\
grammarians. (I &#39;Ak p. 123.) Sometimes it is<br>\
conjoined with the negative لَا, and the ignorant<br>\
may imagine it to be the exceptive إِلَّا; as in [the<br>\
saying in the Kur ix. 40,] إِلَّا تَنْصُرُوهُ فَقَد نَصَرَهُ اللّٰهُ<br>\
[If ye will not aid him, certainly God did<br>\
aid him]; and [in the next preceding verse,]<br>\
إِلَّا تَنْفِرُوا يُعَذِّبْكُمْ [If ye will not go forth to war,<br>\
He will punish you]. (Mughnee, K. *) It is<br>\
sometimes used to denote one&#39;s feigning himself<br>\
ignorant; as when you say to one who asks, “Is<br>\
thy child in the house? ” and thou hast knowledge<br>\
thereof, إِنْ كَانَ فِى الدَّارِ أَعْلَمْتُكَ بِهِ [If he be in<br>\
the house, I will inform thee thereof]. (Msb.)<br>\
And to denote one&#39;s putting the knowing in the<br>\
predicament of the ignorant, in order to incite to<br>\
the doing or continuing an action; as when you<br>\
say, إِنٌ كُنْتَ ابُنِى فَأَطِعْنِى [If thou be my son,<br>\
obey me]; as though you said, “Thou knowest<br>\
that thou art my son, and it is incumbent on the<br>\
son to obey the father, and thou art not obedient;<br>\
therefore do what thou art commanded to do. ”<br>\
(Msb.) And sometimes it is divested of the conditional meaning, and becomes syn. with لَو; as<br>\
in the saying, صَلِّ وَإِنٌ عَجَزْتَ عَنِ القِيَام [Pray<br>\
thou though thou be unable to stand;] i. e. pray<br>\
thou whether thou be able to stand or unable to<br>\
do so; and in the saying, أَكْرِمٌ زِيْدًا وَإِنْ قَعَدَ<br>\
i. e. [Treat thou Zeyd with honour] though he be<br>\
sitting; or, whether he sit or not. (Msb.) [إِمَّا<br>\
as a compound of the conditional إِنٌ and the<br>\
redundant مَا, see in an art. of which اما is the<br>\
heading.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Secondly,] it is a negative, (S,<br>\
Mughnee, K,) syn. with مَا; (S;) and is put<br>\
before a nominal proposition; (Mughnee, K;) as<br>\
in the saying [in the Kur lxvii. 20], إِنِ الْكَافِرُونَ<br>\
إِلَّا فِى غُرُورٍ [The unbelievers are not in aught<br>\
save in a deception]; (S, Mughnee, K;) and<br>\
before a verbal proposition; as in [the Kur ix. 108,]<br>\
إِنْ أَرَدْنَا إِلَّا الْحُسْنَى [We desired not, or meant<br>\
not, aught save that which is best]. (Mughnee,<br>\
K.) The assertion of some, that the negative إِنٌ<br>\
does not occur except where it is followed by إِلَّا,<br>\
as in the instances cited above, or by لَمَّا, with tesh-deed, which is syn. therewith, as, accord. to a<br>\
reading of some of the Seven [Readers], in the<br>\
saying [in the Kur lxxxvi. 4], إِنْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ لَمَّا<br>\
عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ, i. e., مَا كُلُّ نَفْسٍ إِلَّا عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ [There<br>\
is not any soul but over it is a guardian], is<br>\
refuted by the sayings in the Kur [x. 69 and<br>\
lxxii. 26], إِنْ عِندَكُمْ مِنْ سُلْطَانٍ بِهٰذَا [meaning,<br>\
accord. to the Jel., Ye have no proof of this that<br>\
ye say], and إِنْ أَدْرِيأَقَرِيبٌ مَا تُوعَدُونَ [I know<br>\
not whether that with which ye are threatened be<br>\
nigh]. (Mughnee, K. *) The conditional and the<br>\
negative both occur in the saying in the Kur<br>\
[xxxv. 39], وَلَئِنْ زَالَتَا إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِنْ بَعْدِهِ<br>\
[And I swear that, if they should quit their place,<br>\
not any one should withhold them after Him]:<br>\
the former is conditional; and the latter is negative, and is [part of] the complement of the oath<br>\
which is denoted by the ل prefixed to the former;<br>\
the complement of the condition being necessarily<br>\
suppressed. (Mughnee.) When it is put before<br>\
a nominal proposition, it has no government,<br>\
accord. to Sb and Fr; but Ks and Mbr allow its<br>\
governing in the manner of لَيْسَ; and Sa&#39;eed<br>\
Ibn-Jubeyr reads, [in the Kur vii. 193,] إِنِ الَّذِينَ<br>\
تَدْعُونَ مِنْ دُونِ اللّٰهِ عِبَادًا أَمْثَالَكُمٌ [Those whom ye<br>\
invoke beside God, or others than God, are not<br>\
men like you]: also, the people of El-&#39;Áliyeh<br>\
have been heard to say, إِنٌ أَحَدٌ خَيْرًامِنْ أَحدٍ إِلَّا<br>\
بِالعَافِيَةِ [Any one is not better than any other one,<br>\
except by means of health, or soundness]; and<br>\
إِنْ ذٰلِكَ نَافِعَكَ وَلَا ضَارَّكَ [That is not profitable to<br>\
thee nor injurious to thee]: as an ex. of its occurrence without government, which is mostly the<br>\
case, the saying of some, قَائمٌ ↓ إِنَّ may be<br>\
explained as originally إِنٌ أَنَا قَائِمٌ [I am not<br>\
standing]; the أ of أَنَا being elided for no reason<br>\
in itself, and the ن of إِنٌ being incorporated into<br>\
the ن of أَنَا, and the ا of this latter being elided<br>\
in its conjunction with the following word; but<br>\
إِنَّ قَائِمًا has also been heard. (Mughnee.) Sometimes it occurs [as a negative] in the complement<br>\
of an oath: you say, وَاللّٰهِ إِنٌ فَعَلْتُ, meaning<br>\
مَا فَعَلْتُ [By God, I did not]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Thirdly,]<br>\
it is a contraction of إِنَّ, and is put before a<br>\
nominal and before a verbal proposition. (Mughnee, K.) In the former case, it is made to govern<br>\
and is made to have no government: (S, * K:)<br>\
[i. e.] in this case, it is allowable to make it<br>\
govern; contr. to the opinion of the Koofees:<br>\
(Mughnee:) Lth says that he who uses the contracted form of إِنَّ uses the nom. case with it,<br>\
except that some of the people of El-Hijáz use the<br>\
accus. case with it: (T:) thus it is said, accord.<br>\
to one reading, [in the Kur xi. 113,] إِنْ كُلَّا لَمَا<br>\
لَيُوَفِّيَنَّهُمٌ رَبُّكَ أَعْمَالَهُمٌ [Verily all of them, thy<br>\
Lord will indeed fully render them the recompense of their works]: (T, Mughnee:) Fr says,<br>\
We have not heard the Arabs use the contracted<br>\
form and make it to govern, unless with a pronoun,<br>\
in which case the desinential syntax is not apparent; and he adds that in the instance cited above,<br>\
they make كُلّا to be governed in the accus. case<br>\
by ليوفّينّهم; as though the phrase were لَيُوَفِّيَنَّهُمْ<br>\
كُلَّا; and that كُلُّ would be proper; for you<br>\
say, إِنْ زَيْدٌ لَقَائِمٌ [Verily Zeyd is standing]:<br>\
(T:) the ex. given by Sb is, إِنْ عَمْرًا لَمُنطَلِقٌ<br>\
[Verily &#39;Amr is going away]. (Mughnee.) But<br>\
it is [most] frequently made to have no government; as in the saying [in the Kur xliii. 34<br>\
accord. to one reading], وَإِنْ كُلُّ ذٰلِكَ لَمَا مَتَاعُ<br>\
الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا [And verily all that is the furniture<br>\
of the present life]; and, accord. to the reading<br>\
of Hafs, [and of &#39;Ásim and Kh, in the Kur xx. 66,<br>\
respecting which see إِنَّ,] إِنْ هٰذَانِ لَسَاحِرَانِ<br>\
[Verily these two are enchanters]; &amp;c. (Mughnee.) When it is put before a verbal proposition,<br>\
it is necessarily made to have no government:<br>\
(Mughnee, K:) and in most cases the verb is a<br>\
preterite and of the kind called نَاسِخ [which<br>\
effects a change of the grammatical form or of the<br>\
meaning in a nominal proposition before which it<br>\
is placed]; as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 138],<br>\
وَإِنْ كَانَتٌ لَكَبِيرَةً [And verily it was a great<br>\
matter]; and [in the Kur xvii. 75,] وَإِنْ كَادُوا<br>\
لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ [And verily they were near to seducing<br>\
thee]; (Mughnee;) in which last ex. AZ says, it<br>\
means لَقَدْ, i. e. without doubt; and so in the<br>\
same ch. vv. 78 and 108: (T:) less frequently it<br>\
is an aor. of a verb of this kind; as in the saying<br>\
[in the Kur xxvi. 186], وَإِنْ نَظُنُّكَ لَمِنَ الْكَاذِبينَ<br>\
[And verily we think thee to be of the number of<br>\
the liars]: and both these kinds of expression<br>\
may be taken as exs. to be imitated: less frequently than this it is a preterite of a verb not<br>\
of the kind termed نَسخ; as in the saying [of a<br>\
poet],<br>\
شَلَّتٌ يَمِينُكَ إِنٌ قَتَلْتَ لَمُسْلِمًا<br>\
[May thy right arm, or hand, dry up, or become<br>\
unsound! verily thou hast slain a Muslim]; but<br>\
this may not be taken as an ex. to be imitated; contr.<br>\
to the opinion of Akh; for he allows the phrase,<br>\
إِنْ قِامَ لَأَنَا [Verily I stood], and إِنٌ قَعَدَ لأَنْتَ<br>\
[Verily thou sattest]: and less frequently than<br>\
this it is an aor. of a verb not of the kind termed<br>\
ناسخ; as in the saying, إِنْ يَزِينُكَ لَنَفْسُكَ وَإِنٌ<br>\
يَشِينُكَ لَهِيَهٌ [Verily thy soul is that which beautifies<br>\
thee, and it is that which deforms thee]; and this,<br>\
by common consent, may not be taken as an ex.<br>\
to be imitated. (Mughnee.) Wherever you find<br>\
إِنٌ with لَ after it, decide that it is originally إِنَّ;<br>\
(Mughnee, K;) as in the exs. above: but respecting<br>\
this ل there is a difference of opinion: see this<br>\
letter. (Mughnee.) J says, (TA,) إِنٌ is sometimes a contraction of إِنَّ, and this must have ل<br>\
put before its predicate, to compensate for what is<br>\
elided, of the doubled letter; as in the saying in<br>\
the Kur [lxxxvi. 4, accord. to him who reads لَمَا<br>\
instead of لَمَّا], إِنْ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ لَمَا عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ [Verily<br>\
every soul hath over it a guardian]; and in the<br>\
saying, إِنٌ زَيدٌ لَأَخُوكَ [Verily Zeyd is thy brother];<br>\
in order that it may not be confounded with إِنٌ<br>\
which is syn. with the negative مَا: (S, TA:) but<br>\
IB says, ل is here introduced to distinguish<br>\
between negation and affirmation, and this إِنْ has<br>\
neither subject nor predicate; so J&#39;s saying that<br>\
the ل is put before its predicate is without meaning: and this ل is sometimes introduced with the<br>\
objective complement of a verb; as in إِنْ ضَرَبْتُ<br>\
لَزَيْدًا [Verily I struck, or beat, Zeyd]; and with<br>\
the agent; as in إِنْ قَامَ لَزَيْدٌ [Verily Zeyd stood].<br>\
(TA.) When the contracted إِنْ governs, this ل<br>\
is not necessary; so you may say, إِنْ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ<br>\
[Verily Zeyd is standing]; because in this case<br>\
it cannot be confounded with the negative; for<br>\
the negative does not render the subject mansoob<br>\
and the predicate marfooa: and when it does not<br>\
govern, if the meaning is apparent, the ل is not<br>\
needed; as in<br>\
وَنَحْنُ أُبَاةُ الضَّيْمِ مِنْ آلِ مَالِكٍ<br>\
وَإِنْ مَالِكٌ كَانَتْ كِرَامَ المَعَادِنِ<br>\
[And we are persons who refuse to submit to<br>\
injury, of the family of Málik: and verily the<br>\
family of Málik are generous in respect of their<br>\
origins]; كَانَتْ being here for لَكَانَتٌ. (I &#39;Ak<br>\
p. 99.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Fourthly,] it is redundant, (S, Mughnee, K,) occurring with مَا; as in the saying,<br>\
مَا إِنْ يَقُومُ زَيْدٌ [Zeyd does not stand]; (S;) and<br>\
in the saying [of a poet],<br>\
كَا إِنْ أَتَيْتَ بِشْىءٍ أَنْتَ تَكْرَهُهُ<br>\
[Thou didst not a thing which thou dislikest].<br>\
(Mughnee, K: in the CK اَتْتُ.) It is mostly<br>\
thus used after the negative ما, when put before a<br>\
verbal proposition; as above; or before a nominal<br>\
proposition; as in the saying,<br>\
مَنَايَانَا وَدَوْلَةُ آخَرِينَا  وَمَا إِنْ طِبُّنَا جبُنٌ ولٰكِنٌ<br>\
[And our habit is not cowardice; but our destinies<br>\
and the good fortune of others caused our being<br>\
defeated]: and in this case it prevents the government of ما, as in this verse: but in the saying,<br>\
بَنِى غُدَانَةَ مَا إِنْ أَنْتُمُ ذَهَبًا<br>\
وَلَا صَرِيفًا وَلٰكِنٌ أَنْتُمُ الخَزَفُ<br>\
[Sons of Ghudáneh, ye are not indeed gold, nor<br>\
silver, or pure silver, but ye are pottery], accord.<br>\
to him who relates it thus, saying ذهبًا and صريفًا,<br>\
in the accus. case, it is explained as a negative,<br>\
corroborative of ما: (Mughnee:) and accord. to J,<br>\
(TA,) the negatives مَا and إِنٌ are sometimes<br>\
thus combined for corroboration; as in the saying<br>\
of the rájiz, (El-Aghlab El-&#39;Ijlee, TA,)<br>\
أَكْثَرَ مِنْهُ قِرَةً وَقَارَا  مَا إِنٌ رَأَيْنَا مَلِكَّا أَغَارَا<br>\
[We have not indeed seen a king who has made<br>\
a hostile incursion possessing more numerous<br>\
sheep, or goats, and camels, than he]; (S, TA;)<br>\
but IB says that ان is here redundant, not a<br>\
negative. (TA.) Sometimes it is redundant after<br>\
the conjunct noun مَا; as in the saying,<br>\
يُرَجِىّ المَرْإُ مَا إِنٌ لَا يَرَاهُ<br>\
وَتَعْرِضُ دُونَ أَدْنَاهُ الخُطُوبُ<br>\
[Man hopes for that which he will not see; for<br>\
calamities intervene as obstacles in the way to<br>\
what is nearest thereof]. (Mughnee.) And after<br>\
the مَا termed مَصْدَرِيَّة, (Mughnee,) [i. e.,] after<br>\
the adverbial مَا [which is of the kind termed<br>\
مصدريّة]; (TA;) as in the saying (of Maaloot<br>\
El-Kurey&#39;ee, cited by Sb, TA),<br>\
وَرَجِّ الفَتَى لِلْخَيْرِ مَا إِنْ رَأَيْتَهُ<br>\
عَلَي السِّنِّ خَيْرًا لَايَزَالُ يَزِيدُ<br>\
[And hope thou that the youth is destined for<br>\
good as long as thou hast seen him not ceasing<br>\
to increase in good with age]. (Mughnee.) And<br>\
after the inceptive أَلَا; as in the saying,<br>\
أَلَا إِنْ سَرَى لَيْلِى فبِتُّ كَئِيبَا<br>\
أُحَاذِرُ أَنْ تَنْأَى النَّوَى بِغَضُوبَا<br>\
[Now he journeyed on, or during, that my night,<br>\
and I passed the night in an evil state, broken<br>\
in spirit by grief, being fearful that the distance<br>\
to which he was going with Ghadoob (a woman<br>\
so named) would become far]. (Mughnee.) And<br>\
before the meddeh denoting disapproval: [for]<br>\
Sb heard a man, on its being said to him, “Wilt<br>\
thou go forth if the desert become plentiful<br>\
in herbage? ” reply, أَأَنَا إِنِيهٌ [What, I, indeed?]<br>\
disapproving that he should think otherwise than<br>\
that. (Mughnee. [See also art. انى.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Fifthly,] it is syn. with قَدْ: so it is said to be in the<br>\
saying [in the Kur lxxxvii. 9], إِنْ نَفَعَتِ الذِّكْرَى<br>\
[Admonition hath profited], (T, Mughnee, K,)<br>\
by IAar (T) and by Ktr: (Mughnee:) and Abu-l-&#39; Abbás relates that the Arabs say, إِنٌ نَفَعَتِ الذِّكْرَى<br>\
meaning قَدْ قَامَ زَيْدٌ [Zeyd has stood]; and he<br>\
adds, that Ks states his having heard them say so,<br>\
and having thought that it expressed a condition,<br>\
but that he asked them, and they answered that<br>\
they meant قَدْ قَامَ زَيْدٌ, and not مَا قَامَ زَيْدٌ. (T.)<br>\
[So too, accord. to the K, in all the exs. cited in<br>\
the next sentence as from the Mughnee; but this<br>\
is evidently a mistake, occasioned by an accidental<br>\
omission.] ―<br>\
-b6-  [Sixthly,] it is asserted also by the<br>\
Koofees, that it is syn. with إِذْ, in the following<br>\
exs.: in the Kur [v. 62], وَاتَّقُوا اللّٰهَ إِنٌ كُنْتُمْ<br>\
مُؤْمِنِينَ [And fear ye God, because ye are believers: and so, accord. to AZ, as is said in the<br>\
T, in a similar instance in the Kur ii. 278: and<br>\
in the same, iv. 62]: and [in the Kur xlviii. 27,]<br>\
لَتَدْ خُلُنَّ المَسْجِدَ الْحَرَامَ إِنْ شَآءَ آمِنِينَ [Ye<br>\
shall assuredly enter the sacred mosque, because<br>\
God hath willed, in security]: and in like instances,<br>\
when the verb therein expresses what is held sure<br>\
to happen or to have happened: and in the saying,<br>\
أَتَغْضَبُ إِنٌ أُدْنَا قُتَيْبَةَ حُزَّتَا<br>\
جِهَارًا وَلَمْ تَغْضَبْ لِقَتْلِ ابْنِ حَازِمِ<br>\
[Art thou angry because the ears of Kuteybeh<br>\
have been cut, openly, or publicly, and wast not<br>\
angry for the slaughter of Ibn-Házim?]: (Mughnee:) but in all these instances [it is sufficiently<br>\
obvious that] ان may be otherwise explained.<br>\
(Mughnee, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Seventhly,] it is sometimes<br>\
syn. with إِذَا; as in the Kur [ix. 23], لَا تَتَّخِذُوا<br>\
آبَآءَكُمْ وَإِخْوَانَكُمْ أَوْلِيَآءَ إِنِ اسْتَحَبُّوا الْكُفْرَعَلَى<br>\
الْإِيمَانِ [Take not ye your fathers and your<br>\
brethren as friends when they love unbelief above<br>\
belief]; and in the same [xxxiii. 49], وَامْرَأَةً مُؤْمِنَةً<br>\
إِنْ وَهَبَتْ نَفْسَهَا لِلنَّبِىّ [And a believing woman<br>\
when she giveth herself to the Prophet]: so says<br>\
AZ. (T.) ―<br>\
-b8-  [Eighthly,] it is used for إِمَّا,<br>\
(Mughnee and K, voce إِمَّا,) distinct from إِمَّا<br>\
which is a compound of the conditional إِنٌ and<br>\
the redundant مَا. (Mughnee ibid.) [See an ex.<br>\
in a verse cited voce إِمَّا in the present work,<br>\
commencing with the words سَقَتْهُ الرَّوَاعِدُ.]<br>\
أَنَ: see أَنْ, in four places.<br>\
أَنَّ is one of the particles which annul the<br>\
quality of the inchoative; and is originally إِنَّ;<br>\
therefore Sb has not mentioned it among those<br>\
particles [as distinct from إِنَّ, from which, however, it is distinguished in meaning]: (I &#39;Ak<br>\
p. 90:) it is a corroborative particle; (I &#39;Ak,<br>\
Mughnee;) a particle governing the subject in<br>\
the accus. case and the predicate in the nom. case,<br>\
(S, I &#39;Ak, Mughnee, K,) combining with what<br>\
follows it to form an equivalent to an inf. n., (S,)<br>\
[for,] accord. to the most correct opinion, it is<br>\
a conjunct particle, which, together with its two<br>\
objects of government, is explained by means of<br>\
an inf. n. (Mughnee.) If the predicate is derived,<br>\
the inf. n. by means of which it is explained is<br>\
of the same radical letters; so that the implied<br>\
meaning of بَلَغَنِي أَنَّكَ تَنْطَلِقُ [It has come to my<br>\
knowledge, or been related to me, or been told<br>\
to me, or it came to my knowledge, &amp;c., that thou<br>\
goest away], or أَنَّكَ مُنْطَلِقٌ [that thou art going<br>\
away], is بَلَغَنِي الاِنْطِلَاقُ [or rather انْطِلَاقُكَ thy<br>\
going away has come to my knowledge, &amp;c.];<br>\
and hence, the implied meaning of بَلَغَنِى أَنَّكَ فِي<br>\
الدَّارِ [It has come to my knowledge, &amp;c., that thou<br>\
art in the house] is بَلَغَنِى اسْتِقْرَارُكَ فِي الدَّارِ [thy<br>\
remaining in the house has come to my knowledge,<br>\
&amp;c.], because thea predicate is properly a word<br>\
suppressed from اِستَقَرَّ or مُسْتَقِرٌّ: and if the predicate is underived, the implied meaning is explained by the word كَوْنِ; so that the implied<br>\
meaning of بَلَغَنِى أَنَّ هٰذا زَيْدٌ [It has come to<br>\
my knowledge, &amp;c., that this is Zeyd] is بَلَغَنِى<br>\
كَوْنُهُ زَيْدًا [his being Zeyd has come to my knowledge, &amp;c.]; for the relation of every predicate<br>\
expressed by an underived word to its subject<br>\
may be denoted by a word signifying “ being; ”<br>\
so that you say, هٰذَا زَيْدٌ and, if you will, هٰذَا<br>\
كَائِنٌ زَيْدًا; both signifying the same. (Mughnee.) There are cases in which either أَنَّ or إِنَّ<br>\
may be used: [see the latter, in twelve places:]<br>\
other cases in which only the former may be<br>\
used: and others in which only the latter. (I &#39;Ak<br>\
p. 91.) The former only may be used when the<br>\
implied meaning is to be explained by an inf. n.<br>\
(I &#39;Ak, K.) Such is the case when it occurs in<br>\
the place of a noun governed by a verb in the<br>\
nom. case; as in يُعْجِبُنِى أَنَّكَ قَائِمٌ [It pleases<br>\
me that thou art standing], i. e. قِيَامُكَ [thy<br>\
standing pleases me]: or in the place of a noun<br>\
governed by a verb in the accus. case; as in<br>\
عَرَفْتُ أَتَّكَ قَائِمٌ [I knew that thou wast standing],<br>\
i. e. قِيَامَكَ [thy standing]: or in the place of a<br>\
noun governed in the gen. case by a particle;<br>\
as in عَجِبْتُ مِنْ أَنَّكَ قَائِمٌ [I wondered that thou<br>\
wast standing], i. e. مِنْ قِيَامكَ [at, or by reason<br>\
of, thy standing]: (I &#39;Ak p. 91:) [and sometimes<br>\
a preposition is understood; as in لَا شَكَّ أَنَّهُ كَذَا,<br>\
for لَا شَكَّ فِى أَنَّهُ كَذَا There is no doubt that<br>\
it is thus, i. e. لَا شّكَّ فِى كَوْنِهِ كَذَا There is no<br>\
doubt of its being thus:] and أَنَّ must be used<br>\
after لَوْ; as in لَوْ أَنَّكَ قَائِمٌ لَقُمْتُ [If that thou<br>\
wert standing, I had stood, or would have stood,<br>\
i. e. لَوْ ثَبَتَ قِيَامُكَ, or لَوْ قِيَامُكَ ثَابِتٌ, accord. to<br>\
different opinions, both meaning if thy standing<br>\
were a fact: see I &#39;Ak pp. 305 and 306]. (K.)<br>\
Sometimes its أ is changed into ع; so that you<br>\
say, عَلِمْتُ عَنَّكَ مُنْطَلِقٌ [meaning I knew that<br>\
thou wast going away]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  With ك prefixed to it, it is a particle of comparison, (S, * M,<br>\
TA,) [still] governing the subject in the accus.<br>\
case and the predicate in the nom. case: (TA:)<br>\
you say, كَأَنَّ زَيْدًا عَمْرٌو [It is as though Zeyd<br>\
were &#39;Amr], meaning that Zeyd is like &#39;Amr; as<br>\
though you said, إِنَّ زَيْدًا كَائِنٌ كَعَمْرٍو [verily,<br>\
Zeyd is like &#39;Amr]: [it is to be accounted for by<br>\
an ellipsis: or] the ك is taken away from the<br>\
middle of this proposition, and put at its commencement, and then the kesreh of إِنَّ necessarily<br>\
becomes changed to a fet-hah, because إِنَّ cannot<br>\
be preceded by a preposition, for it never occurs<br>\
but at the commencement [of a proposition]. (IJ,<br>\
M.) Sometimes, كَأَنَّ denotes denial; as in the<br>\
saying, كَأَنَّكَ أَمِيرُنَا فَتَأْمُرَنَا [As though thou wert<br>\
our commander so that thou shouldst command<br>\
us], meaning thou art not our commander [that<br>\
thou shouldst command us]. (TA.) It also denotes wishing; as in the saying, كَأْنَّكَ بِي قَدْ<br>\
قُلْتُ الشِّعْرَ فَأُجِيدَهُ, meaning Would that I had<br>\
poetized, or versified, so that I might do it well:<br>\
(TA:) [an elliptical form of speech, of which the<br>\
implied meaning seems to be, would that I were<br>\
as though thou sawest me that I had poetized,<br>\
&amp;c.; or the like: for] you say [also], كَأَنِّى بِكَ<br>\
meaning كَأَنِّى أَبْصُرُ بِكَ [It is as though I saw<br>\
thee]; i. e. I know from what I witness of thy<br>\
condition to-day how thy condition will be tomorrow; so that it is as though I saw thee in<br>\
that condition: (Har p. 126: [see also بِ; near<br>\
the end of the paragraph:]) [thus,] كَأَنَّ also denotes knowing; and also thinking; [the former as<br>\
in the saying immediately preceding, and] as when<br>\
you say, كَأَنَّ اللّٰهَ يَفْعَلُ مَا يَشَآءُ [I know, or rather<br>\
it appears, as though seen, that God does what<br>\
He wills]; and [the latter as when you say,]<br>\
كَأَنَّكَ خَارِجٌ [I think, or rather it seems, that<br>\
Thou art going forth]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [When it has<br>\
The affixed pronoun of the first person, sing. Or<br>\
Pl., you say, أَنِّى and أَنَّنِى, and أَنَّا and أَنَّنَا: and<br>\
When it has also the ك of comparison prefixed to<br>\
It,] you say, كَأَنِّى and كَأَنَّنِى, [and كَأَنَّا and<br>\
كَأَنَّنَا,] like as you say, لٰكِنِّى and لٰكِنَّنِى [&amp;c.].<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  As أَنَّ is a derivative from إِنَّ, it is correctly asserted by Z that أَنَّمَا imports restriction,<br>\
like ↓ إِنَّمَا; both of which occur in the saying<br>\
in the Kur [xxi. 108], يُوحَى إِلَىَّ أَنَّمَا ↓ قُلْ إِنَّمَا<br>\
إِلٰهُكُمْ إِلٰهً وَاحِدٌ [Say thou, It is only revealed to<br>\
me that your God is only one God]: the former<br>\
is for the restricting of the quality to the qualified;<br>\
and the latter, for the reverse: (Mughnee, K:)<br>\
i. e. the former is for the restricting of the revelation to the declaration of the unity; and the<br>\
latter, for the restricting of “ your God ” to unity:<br>\
(Marginal note in a copy of the Mughnee:) but<br>\
these words of the Kur do not imply that nothing<br>\
save the unity was revealed to the Prophet; for<br>\
the restriction is limited to the case of the discourse<br>\
with the believers in a plurality of gods; so that<br>\
the meaning is, there has not been revealed to<br>\
me [aught], respecting the godhead, except the<br>\
unity; not the attribution of any associate to God.<br>\
(Mughnee.) [أَنَّمَا, however, does not always import restriction; nor does always even ↓ إِنَّمَا: in<br>\
each of these, ما is what is termed كَافَّةٌ; i. e.,<br>\
it restricts the particle to which it is affixed from<br>\
exercising any government; and sometimes has<br>\
no effect upon the signification of that particle:<br>\
(see art. مَا; and see إِنَّمَا, below, voce إِنَّ:) thus,<br>\
for instance, in the Kur viii. 28, وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا<br>\
أَمْوَالُكُمْ فِتْنَةً means And know ye that<br>\
your possessions and your children are a trial;<br>\
not that they are only a trial. When it has the<br>\
ك of comparison prefixed to it, it is sometimes<br>\
contracted; as in the following ex.:] a poet says,<br>\
كَأَمَّا يَخْتَطِينَ عَشلَى قَتَادٍ<br>\
وَيَسْتَضْحِكْنَ عَنْ حَبِّ الغَمَامِ<br>\
[As though, by reason of their mincing gait, they<br>\
were walking upon tragacanthas; and they were<br>\
laughing so as to discover teeth like hailstones:<br>\
كَأَمَّا being for كَأَنَّمَا. (IAar.) ―<br>\
-b5-  أَنَّ is someTimes contracted into أَنْ; (S, Mughnee;) and in<br>\
This case, it governs in the manner already exPlained, voce أَنْ. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b6-  It is also syn.<br>\
with لَعَلَّ; (Sb, S, M, Mughnee, K;) as in the<br>\
saying, اِيتِ السُّوقَ أَنَّكَ تَشْتَرِى لَنَا شَيْئًا [Come thou<br>\
to the market; may-be thou wilt buy for us something; اِيتِ being originally اِئْتِ]; i. e. لَعَلَّكَ:<br>\
(Sb, M, Mughnee, K: *) and, accord. to some,<br>\
(M, Mughnee, K,) so in the Kur [vi. 109], where<br>\
it is said, وَمَا يُشْعِرُكُمْ أَنَّهَا إِذَا جَآءَتْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ<br>\
[And what maketh you to know? (meaning,<br>\
maketh you to know that they will believe when<br>\
it cometh? i. e. ye do not know that: Jel:) Maybe, when it cometh, they will not believe]: (S, M,<br>\
Mughnee, K:) thus accord. to this reading:<br>\
(Mughnee, K:) and Ubeí here reads لَعَلَّهَا. (S.)<br>\
أَنَّ and لَأَنَّ and لَوْ أَنَّ are all syn. with عَلَّ and<br>\
لَعَلَّ; and أَنِّى and أَنَّنِى, and لَأَنِّى and لأَنَّنِى, and<br>\
لُوْ أَنِّى and لَوْ أَنِّنِى, with عَلِّى and لَعَلِّى. (K voce<br>\
لَعَلَّ.) ―<br>\
-b7-  It is also syn. with أَجَلْ [Yes, or yea;<br>\
or it is as thou sayest]. (M, TA.) [See also إِنَّ<br>\
as exemplified by a verse commencing with وَيَقُلْنَ<br>\
and by a saying of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr.]<br>\
إِنَّ is one of the particles which annul the<br>\
quality of the inchoative, like أَنَّ, of which it is<br>\
the original: (I &#39;Ak p. 90:) it is a corroborative<br>\
particle, (I &#39;Ak, Mughnee,) corroborating the<br>\
predicate; (S, K;) governing the subject in the<br>\
accus. case and the predicate in the nom. case;<br>\
(S, I &#39;Ak, Mughnee, K;) [and may generally be<br>\
rendered by Verily, or certainly, or the like;<br>\
exactly agreeing with the Greek<br>\
ὃτι, as used in<br>\
Luke vii. 16 and in many other passages in the<br>\
New Testament; though it often seems to be<br>\
nothing more than a sign of inception, which can<br>\
hardly be rendered at all in English; unless in<br>\
pronunciation, by laying a stress upon the predicate, or upon the copula;] as in the saying,<br>\
إِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ [Verily, or certainly, Zeyd is standing; or simply, Zeyd is standing, if we lay a<br>\
stress upon standing, or upon is]. (I &#39;Ak p. 90.)<br>\
But sometimes it governs both the subject and<br>\
the predicate in the accus. case; as in the saying,<br>\
إِذَا اشْتَدَّ جُنْحُ اللَّيْلِ فَلْتَأْتِ وَلْتَكُنٌ<br>\
خُطَاكَ خِفَافًا إِنَّ حُرَّاسَنَا أُسْدَا<br>\
[When the darkness of night becomes, or shall<br>\
become, intense, then do thou come, and let thy<br>\
steps be light: verily our guardians are lions];<br>\
(Mughnee, K; [but in the latter, for اشْتَدَّ, we<br>\
find اسْوَدَّ, so that the meaning is, when the first<br>\
portion of the night becomes, or shall become, black,<br>\
&amp;c.;]) and as in a trad. in which it is said,<br>\
انَّ قَعْرَ جَهَنَّمَ سَبْعِينَ خَرِيفًا [Verily the bottom of<br>\
Hell is a distance of seventy years of journeying]:<br>\
(Mughnee, K:) the verse, however, is explained<br>\
by the supposition that it presents a denotative of<br>\
state [in the last word, which is equivalent to<br>\
شِجْعَانًا or the like], and that the predicate is suppressed, the meaning being, تَلْقَاهُمْ أُسْدًا [thou<br>\
wilt find them lions]; and the trad. by the supposition that قَعْرَ is an inf. n., and سَبْعِينَ is an<br>\
adverbial noun, so that the meaning is, the reaching the bottom of hell is [to be accomplished in<br>\
no less time than] in seventy years. (Mughnee.)<br>\
And sometimes the inchoative [of a proposition]<br>\
after it is in the nom. case, and its subject is what<br>\
is termed ضَمِيرُ شَأْنٍ, suppressed; as in the saying<br>\
of Mohammad, إِنَّ مِنْ أَشَدِّ النَّاسِ عَذَابًا يَوْمَ القِيٰمَةِ<br>\
المُصَوِّرُونَ [Verily, (the case is this:) of the men<br>\
most severely to be punished, on the day of resurrection, are the makers of images], originally إِنَّهُ,<br>\
i. e. إِنَّ الشَّأْنَ; (Mughnee, K; *) and as in the<br>\
saying in the Kur [xx. 66], إِنَّ هٰذَانِ لَسَاحِرَانِ,<br>\
[accord. to some,] as will be seen in what follows.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Of the two particles إِنَّ and ↓ أَنَّ, in<br>\
certain cases only the former may be used; and<br>\
in certain other cases either of them may be used.<br>\
(I&#39; Ak p. 91.) The former must be used when it<br>\
occurs inceptively, (Kh, T, I&#39; Ak p. 92, Mughnee,<br>\
K,) having nothing before it upon which it is syntactically dependent, (Kh, T,) with respect to the<br>\
wording or the meaning; (K;) as in إِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ<br>\
[Verily Zeyd is standing]. (I&#39; Ak, K.) It is used<br>\
after أَلَا, (I&#39; Ak, K,) the inceptive particle, (I&#39; Ak,)<br>\
or the particle which is employed to give notice [of<br>\
something about to be said]; (K;) as in أَلَا إِنَّ<br>\
زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ [Now surely Zeyd is standing]. (I&#39; Ak<br>\
K.) And when it occurs at the commencement<br>\
of the complement of a conjunct noun; (I&#39; Ak,<br>\
K; *) as in جَآءَ الَّذِى إِنَّهُ قَائِمٌ [He who is standing<br>\
came]; (I&#39; Ak;) and in the Kur [xxviii. 76],<br>\
وَآتَيْنَاهُ مِنَ الْكُنُورِ مَا إِنَّ مَفَاتِحَهُ لَتَنُوْءُ بِالْعُصْبَةِ أُولِى<br>\
القُوَّةِ [And we gave him, of treasures, that whereof<br>\
the keys would weigh down the company of men<br>\
possessed of strength]. (I&#39; Ak, * K, * TA.) And in<br>\
the complement of an oath, (I&#39; Ak, K,) when its<br>\
predicate has لَ, (I&#39; Ak,) or whether its subject<br>\
or its predicate has لَ or has it not; (K;) as in<br>\
وَاللّٰهِ إِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَائِمٌ [By Allah, verily Zeyd is<br>\
standing], (I&#39; Ak,) and إِنَّهُ قَائِمٌ: or, as some say,<br>\
when you do not employ the ل, the particle is<br>\
with fet-h; as in قَائِمٌ ↓ وَاللّٰهِ أَنَّكَ [I swear by<br>\
Allah that thou art standing]; mentioned by Ks<br>\
as thus heard by him from the Arabs: (TA:)<br>\
but respecting this case we shall have to speak<br>\
hereafter. (I&#39; Ak.) And when it occurs after the<br>\
word قَوْلٌ or a derivative thereof, in repeating the<br>\
saying to which that word relates; (Fr, T, I&#39; Ak, *<br>\
K; *) as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 156],<br>\
وَقَوْلِهِمْ إِنَّا قَتَلْنَا الْمَسِيحَ [And their saying, Verily<br>\
we have slain the Messiah]; (Fr, T;) and قُلْتُ<br>\
إِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ [I said, Verily Zeyd is standing];<br>\
(I&#39; Ak;) and [in the Kur v. 115,] قَالَ اللّٰهُ إِنّى<br>\
مُنّزِّلُهَا عَلَيْكُمْ [God said, Verily I will cause it to<br>\
descend unto you]; accord. to the dial. of him<br>\
who does not pronounce it with fet-h: (K:) but<br>\
when it occurs in explaining what is said, you use<br>\
↓ أَنَّ; as in the saying, قَدْ قُلْتُ لَكَ كَلَامًا حَسَنًا<br>\
أَنَّ أَبَاكَ شَرِيفٌ وَأَنَّكَ عَاقِلٌ [I have said to thee a<br>\
good saying; that thy father is noble and that<br>\
thou art intelligent]; (Fr, T;) or when the word<br>\
signifying “ saying ” is used as meaning “ thinking; ” as in أَتَقُولُ أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ [Dost thou say<br>\
that Zeyd is standing?], meaning أَتَظُنُّ [Dost<br>\
thou think?]. (I&#39; Ak.) Also, when it occurs in a<br>\
phrase denotative of state; (I&#39; Ak;) [i. e.,] after<br>\
the و denotative of state; (K;) as in زُرْتُهُ وَإِنِّى<br>\
ذُوأَمَلٍ [I visited him, I verily having hope, or<br>\
expectation]; (I&#39; Ak;) and in جَآءَ زِيْدٌ وَ إِنَّ يَدَهُ<br>\
عَلَى رَأْسِهِ [Zeyd came, he verily having his hand<br>\
upon his head]. (K.) And when it occurs in a<br>\
phrase which is the predicate of a proper (as<br>\
opposed to an ideal) substantive; (I&#39; Ak, K; *)<br>\
as in زَيْدٌ إِنَّهُ قَائِمٌ [Zeyd, verily he is standing],<br>\
(I&#39; Ak,) or ذَاهِبٌ [going away]; contr. to the<br>\
assertion of Fr. (K.) And when it occurs before<br>\
the ل which suspends the grammatical government of a verb of the mind, preceding it, with<br>\
respect to its objective complements; (I&#39; Ak, K; *)<br>\
as in عَلِمْتُ إِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَائِمٌ [I knew Zeyd verily<br>\
was standing]; (I&#39; Ak;) and in [the Kur lxiii. 1,]<br>\
وَاللّٰهُ يَعْلَمُ إِنَّكَ لَرَسُولُهُ [And God knoweth thou<br>\
verily art his apostle]: (K:) but if the ل is not<br>\
in its predicate, you say, ↓ أَنَّ; as in عَلِمْتُ أَنَّ<br>\
زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ [I knew that Zeyd was standing].<br>\
(I&#39; Ak.) And in the like of the saying in the Kur<br>\
[ii. 171], وَإِنَّ الَّذِينَ اخْتَلَفُوا فِى الْكِتَابِ لَفِى شَقَاقٍ<br>\
بَعِيدٍ [And verily they who differ among themselves<br>\
respecting the book are in an opposition remote<br>\
from the truth]; because of the ل [of inception]<br>\
which occurs after it, in لَفِى: (Ks, A &#39;Obeyd:)<br>\
the ل of inception which occurs before the predicate of إِنَّ should properly commence the sentence;<br>\
so that إِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَائِمٌ [Verily Zeyd is standing]<br>\
should properly be لَإِنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ; but as the ل<br>\
is a corroborative and إِنَّ is a corroborative, they<br>\
dislike putting two particles of the same meaning<br>\
together, and therefore they put the ل later, transferring it to the predicate: Mbr allows its being<br>\
put before the predicate of ↓ أَنَّ; and thus it<br>\
occurs in an unusual reading of the saying [in the<br>\
Kur xxv. 22], إِلَّا أَنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُونَ الطَّعَامَ [But they<br>\
ate food]; but this is explained by the supposition<br>\
that the ل is here redundant: (I&#39; Ak p. 95:) this<br>\
is the reading of Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Jubeyr: others read,<br>\
إِلَّا إِنَّهُمْ لَيَأْكُلُنَ الطَّعَامَ [but verily they ate food]:<br>\
and إِنَّ [as well as ↓ أَنَّ] is used after the exceptive<br>\
إِلَّا when it is not followed by the ل [of inception].<br>\
(TA.) Also, When it occurs after حَيْثُ; as in<br>\
اِجْلِسْ حَيْثُ إِنَّ زَيْدًا جَالِسٌ [Sit thou where Zeyd<br>\
is sitting]. (I&#39; Ak p. 92, and k) And after<br>\
حَتَّى; as in مَرِضَ زَيْدٌ حَتَّى إِنَّهُمْ لَا يَرْجُونَهُ [Zeyd<br>\
has fallen sick, so that verily they have no hope<br>\
for him: whereas after a particle governing the<br>\
gen. case, [i. e. a preposition,] you say, ↓ أَنَّ.<br>\
(IHsh in De Sacy&#39;s Anthol. Gr. Ar. P. 76.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Either of these two forms may be used after إِذَا<br>\
denoting a thing&#39;s happening suddenly, or unexpectedly; as in خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا إِنَّ زَيْدًاقَائِمٌ [I went<br>\
forth, and lo, verily Zeyd was standing], and<br>\
زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ ↓ فَإِذَا أَنَّ [and lo, or at that present<br>\
time, Zeyd&#39;s standing]; in which latter case, أَنَّ<br>\
with its complement is [properly] an inchoative,<br>\
and its enunciative is إِذَا; the implied meaning<br>\
being, and at that present time was the standing<br>\
of Zeyd: or it may be that the enunciative is<br>\
suppressed, and that the implied meaning is, [and<br>\
lo, or at that present time,] the standing of Zeyd<br>\
was an event come to pass. (I&#39; Ak p. 93.) Also,<br>\
when occurring in the complement of an oath, if<br>\
its enunciative is without ل: (I&#39; Ak:) [see exs.<br>\
given above:] or, as some say, only ↓ أَنَّ is used<br>\
in this case. (TA.) Also, when occurring after<br>\
فَ denoting the complement of a condition; as in<br>\
مَنْ يَأْتِنِى فَإِنَّهُ مُكْرَمٌ [He who cometh to me, verily<br>\
he shall be treated with honour], and مُكْرَمٌ ↓ أَنَّهُ;<br>\
in which latter case, أَنَّ with its complement is an<br>\
inchoative, and the enunciative is suppressed; the<br>\
implied meaning being, honourable treatment of<br>\
him shall be an event come to pass: or it may be<br>\
an enunciative to an inchoative suppressed; the<br>\
implied meaning being, his recompense shall be<br>\
honourable treatment. (I&#39; Ak p. 94.) Also, when<br>\
occurring after an inchoative having the meaning<br>\
of a saying, its enunciative being a saying, and<br>\
the sayer being one; as in خَيْرُ القَوْلِ إِنّى أَحْمَدُ<br>\
[The best saying is, Verily I praise God], and<br>\
أَحْمَدُ ↓ أَنِّى; in which latter case, أَنَّ with its<br>\
complement is an enunciative of خَيْرُ; the implied<br>\
meaning being, the best saying is the praising of<br>\
God [or my praising of God]. (I&#39; Ak ubi suprà.)<br>\
You also say, لَبَّيْكَ إِنَّ الحَمْدَلَكَ [At thy service !<br>\
Verily praise belongeth to Thee! O God]; commencing [with إِنَّ] a new proposition: and sometimes one says, ↓ أَنَّ; meaning بِأَنَّ الحَمْدَ لَكَ<br>\
[because praise belongeth to Thee]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
The cases in which إِن may not be used in the<br>\
place of أَنَّ have been mentioned above, voce أَنَّ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  [When it has the affixed pronoun of the first<br>\
person, sing. or pl.,] you say, إِنِّى and إِنَّنِى, (S,)<br>\
and إِنَّا and إِنَّنَا, (TA,) like as you say لٰكِنِّى and<br>\
لٰكِنِّنِى [&amp;c.]. (S.) إِنَّ as a contraction of إِنَّ أَنَا<br>\
has been mentioned above, as occurring in the<br>\
phrase إِنَّ قَائِمٌ, voce إِنْ, q. v. ―<br>\
-b6-  Accord. to the<br>\
grammarians, (T,) إِنَّمَا is a compound of إِنَّ and مَا,<br>\
(T, S,) which latter prevents the former&#39;s having<br>\
any government: (T:) it imports restriction;<br>\
like أَنَّمَا, which see above, voce أَنَّ, in three<br>\
places: (Mughnee, K:) [i. e.] it imports the<br>\
restriction of that which it precedes to that which<br>\
follows it; as in إِنَّمَا زَيْدٌ مُنْطَلِقٌ [Zeyd is only<br>\
going away], and إِنَّمَا يَنْطَلِقُ زَيْدٌ [Only Zeyd goes<br>\
away]: (Bd in ii. 10:) [in other words,] it is<br>\
used to particularize, or specify, or distinguish a<br>\
thing from other things: (S:) it affirms a thing<br>\
in relation to that which is mentioned after it, and<br>\
denies it in relation to other things; (T, S;) as<br>\
in the saying in the Kur [ix. 60], إِنَّمَا الصَّدَقَاتُ<br>\
لِلْفُقَرَآءِ [The contributions levied for pious uses<br>\
are only, or but, for the poor]: (S:) but El-<br>\
Ámidee and AHei say that it does not import<br>\
restriction, but only corroboration of an affirmation, because it is a compound of the corroborative<br>\
إِنَّ and the redundant مَا which restrains the<br>\
former from exercising government, and that it<br>\
has no application to denote negation implied in<br>\
restriction, as is shown by the trad., إِنَّمَا الِّرِبَا فِى<br>\
النَّسِيْئَةِ [which must mean, Verily usury is in the<br>\
delay of payment], for usury is in other things<br>\
beside that here mentioned, as رِبَا الفضْلِ [or profit<br>\
obtained by the superior value of a thing received<br>\
over that of a thing given], by common consent:<br>\
(Kull p. 76:) some say that it necessarily imports<br>\
restriction: J says what has been cited above from<br>\
the S: some say that it has an overt signification<br>\
in denoting restriction, and is susceptible of the<br>\
meaning of corroboration: some say the reverse<br>\
of this: El-Ámidee says that if it were [properly]<br>\
restrictive, its occurrence in another sense would<br>\
be at variance with the original import; but to<br>\
this it may be replied, that if it were [properly]<br>\
corroborative, its occurrence in another sense<br>\
would be at variance with the original import: it<br>\
[therefore] seems that it is susceptible of both<br>\
these meanings, bearing one or the other according as this or that suits the place. (Msb.) إِنَّمَا is<br>\
to be distinguished from إِنَّ with the conjunct<br>\
[noun] مَا, which does not restrain it from governing [though its government with this is not apparent, and which is written separately]; as in<br>\
إِنَّ مَا عِنْكَ حَسَنٌ meaning Verily what is with<br>\
thee is good, and in إِنَّ مَا فَعَلْتَ حَسَنٌ meaning<br>\
Verily thy deed is good. (I&#39; Ak pp. 97 and 98.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  إِنَّ is sometimes contracted into إِنٌ; (S, Mughnee, K;) and in this case, it is made to govern<br>\
and is made to have no government: (S:) it is<br>\
seldom made to govern in this case; often made<br>\
to have no government: the Koofees say that it<br>\
is not contracted; (Mughnee, K;) and that when<br>\
one says, إِنْ زَيْدٌ لَمُنْطَلِقٌ [the meaning is virtually<br>\
Verily Zeyd is going away, but] إِنٌ is a negative<br>\
and the ل is syn. with إِلّا; but this assertion is<br>\
refuted by the fact that some make it to govern<br>\
when contracted, as in exs. cited above, voce إِنْ,<br>\
q. v. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b8-  It is also syn. with نَعَمٌ<br>\
[Even so; yes; yea]; (Mughnee, K;) contr. to<br>\
the opinion of AO. (Mughnee.) [See also أَنَّ,<br>\
last sentence.] Those who affirm it to have this<br>\
meaning cite as an ex. the following verse (Mughnee, K *) of &#39;Obeyd-Allah Ibn-Keys-er-Rukeiyát:<br>\
(S, * TA:)<br>\
كَ وَقَدْ كَبِرْتَ فَقُلْتُ إِنَّهْ  وَيَقُلْنَ شَيْبٌ قَدْ عَلَا<br>\
[And they say, (namely, the women,) Hoariness<br>\
hath come upon thee, and thou hast become old:<br>\
and I say, Even so, or yes, or yea]: (Mughnee,<br>\
K:) but this has been rebutted by the saying,<br>\
We do not concede that the ه is here added to<br>\
denote the pause, but assert that it is a pronoun,<br>\
governed by إِنَّ in the accus. case, and the predicate is suppressed; the meaning being, إِنَّهُ<br>\
كَذٰلِكَ [Verily it, i. e. the case, is thus]. (Mughnee.) [J says,] The meaning is, إنَّهُ قَدْ كَانَ كَمَا<br>\
تَقُلْنَ [Verily it, i. e. the case, hath been as ye<br>\
say]: A &#39;Obeyd says, This is a curtailment of<br>\
the speech of the Arabs; the pronoun being<br>\
deemed sufficient because the meaning is known:<br>\
and as to the saying of Akh, that it signifies نَعَمْ,<br>\
he only means thereby that it may be so rendered,<br>\
not that it is originally applied to that signification: he says that the ه is here added to denote<br>\
the pause. (S.) There is, however, a good ex.<br>\
of إِنَّ in the sense of نَعَمْ in the saying of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, to him who said to him, “May God<br>\
curse a she camel which carried me to thee,”<br>\
إِنَّ وَرَاكِبَهَا, i. e. Even so, or yes, or yea; and<br>\
may God curse her rider: for the suppression of<br>\
both the subject and the predicate is not allowable.<br>\
(Mughnee.) And hence, accord. to Mbr, the<br>\
saying in the Kur [xx. 66], as thus read, إِنَّ<br>\
هٰذانِ لَسَاحِرَانِ [meaning, if so, Yes, these two are<br>\
enchanters]. (Mughnee.) [But this phrase has<br>\
given rise to much discussion, related in the<br>\
Mughnee and other works. The following is a<br>\
brief abstract of what has been said respecting<br>\
it by several of the leading authorities.] A booIs-hák says that the people of El-Medeeneh and<br>\
El-Koofeh read as above, except &#39;Ásim, who is<br>\
reported to have read, إِنٌ هٰذَانِ, without tesh-deed, and so is Kh; [so too is Hafs, as is said<br>\
above, voce إِنْ;] and that AA read إِنَّ هٰذيْنِ,<br>\
the former word with teshdeed, and the latter in<br>\
the accus. case: that the argument for إِنَّ هٰذَانِ,<br>\
with teshdeed and the nom. case, [or rather what<br>\
is identical in form with the nom. case,] is, that<br>\
it is of the dial. of Kináneh, in which the dual<br>\
is formed by the termination ان in the nom.<br>\
and accus. and gen. cases alike, as also in the<br>\
dial. of Benu-l-Hárith Ibn-Kaab: but that the<br>\
old grammarians say that ه is here suppressed;<br>\
the meaning being, إِنَّهُ هٰذَانِ: (T:) this last<br>\
assertion, however, is weak; for what is applied<br>\
to the purpose of corroboration should not be<br>\
suppressed, and the instances of its suppression<br>\
which have been heard are deviations from general<br>\
usage, except in the case of أَنَّ, with fet-h, contracted into أَنْ: (Mughnee:) Aboo-Is-hák then<br>\
adds, that some say, إِنَّ is here syn. with نَعَمْ:<br>\
this last opinion he holds to be the best; the<br>\
meaning being, نَعَمْ هٰذَانِ لَهُمَا سَاحِرَانِ [Yes,<br>\
these two, verily they are two enchanters: for<br>\
this is not a case in which the ل (which is the ل<br>\
of inception) can be regarded as transferred from<br>\
its proper place, at the commencement of the<br>\
sentence or proposition, as it is in some instances<br>\
mentioned in the former half of this paragraph:<br>\
but it is said in the Mughnee that this explanation<br>\
is invalidated by the fact that the combining of<br>\
the corroborative ل and the suppression of the<br>\
inchoative is like the combining of two things inconsistent, or incompatible; as is also the opinion<br>\
that the ل is redundant, because the redundant ل<br>\
prefixed to the enunciative is peculiar to poetry]:<br>\
next in point of goodness, in the opinion of A booIs-hák, is, that it is of the dial. of Kináneh and<br>\
Benu-l-Hárith Ibn-Kaab: the reading of AA he<br>\
does not allow, because it is at variance with the<br>\
written text: but he approves the reading of<br>\
&#39;Ásim and Kh. (T.)<br>\
-A2-  إِنَّ also occurs as a<br>\
verb: it is the third person pl. fem. of the pret.<br>\
from الأَيْنُ, syn. with التَّعَبُ; or from آنَ syn.<br>\
with قَرُبَ: or the third person sing. masc. of the<br>\
pret. passive from الأَنيِنُ, in the dial. of those<br>\
who, for رُدَّ and حُبَّ, say رِدَّ and حِبَّ, likening<br>\
these verbs to قِيلَ and بِيعَ: or the sing. masc.<br>\
of the imperative from the same: or the pl. fem.<br>\
of the imperative from الأَيْنُ; or from آنَ syn.<br>\

no verb derived from it: (T:) and you say,<br>\
رَجُلٌ أُنَنَةٌ قُنَنَةٌ, [in which the latter epithet is app.<br>\
an imitative sequent to the former,] meaning an<br>\
eloquent man. (TA.) The fem. of أَنَّانٌ is with<br>\

who moans, or says Ah, and is affected with<br>\

مَئِنَّةٌ, occurring in a trad., (S, Mgh, K, &amp;c.,<br>\
in the first and last in art. مأن, and in the second<br>\
in the present art.,) where it is said, إِنَّ طُولَ<br>\
الصَّلَاةِ وَقِصَرَ الخُطْبَةِ مَئِنَّةٌ مِنْ فِقْهِ الرَّجُلِ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
TA, &amp;c.,) is of the measure مَفعِلَةٌ وَقِصَرَ الخُطْبَةِ مَئِنَّةٌ مِنْ فِقْهِ الرَّجُلِ, [originally<br>\
مَأْنِنَةٌ,] from إِنَّ, (S, Z in the Fáïk, IAth, Mgh,<br>\
K,) the corroborative particle; (Z, IAth, Mgh;)<br>\
like مَعْسَاةٌ from عَسَى; (S, K;) but not regularly<br>\
derived from إِنَّ, because a word may not be<br>\
so derived from a particle; or it may be said<br>\
that this is so derived after the particle has been<br>\
made a noun; (Z, IAth;) or neither of these<br>\
modes of derivation is regular: (MF:) the meaning is, [Verily the longness of the prayer and<br>\
the shortness of the oration from the pulpit are<br>\
(together)] a proper ground for one&#39;s saying,<br>\
Verily the man is a person of knowledge or intelligence: (Z, * Mgh, K in art. مأن:) this is the<br>\
proper signification: accord. to AO, the meaning<br>\
is, a thing whereby one learns the knowledge, or<br>\
intelligence, of the man: (Mgh:) or it means<br>\
a thing suitable to, (S, Mgh,) and whereby one<br>\
knows, (S,) the knowledge, or intelligence, of the<br>\
man: (S, Mgh:) or a sign (As, S, K) of the<br>\
knowledge, or intelligence, of the man; and suitable thereto: (As, S:) or an evidence thereof:<br>\
(M:) or an indication, or a symptom, thereof;<br>\
everything that indicates a thing being said to<br>\
be مَئِنَّةٌ لَهُ: [so that مَئِنَّةٌ لِكَذَا may be well rendered a thing that occasions one&#39;s knowing, or<br>\
inferring, or suspecting, such a thing; and in<br>\
like manner, a person that occasions one&#39;s doing<br>\
so: or, more properly, a thing, &amp;c., in which<br>\
such a thing is usually known to take place, or<br>\
have place, or be, or exist, like مَظِنَّةٌ:] one of<br>\
the strangest of the things said of it is, that the ء<br>\
is a substitute for the ظ of مَظِنَّةٌ: (IAth:) this<br>\
seems to have been the opinion of Lh: (Az, L:)<br>\
accord. to AA, it is syn. with آيَةٌ [a sign, &amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.) As says (S, * K, TA, all in art. مأن) that<br>\
the word is thus, with teshdeed to the ن, in the<br>\
trad. and in a verse of poetry, as these are related;<br>\
(S, TA;) but correctly, in his opinion, it should<br>\
be مَئِينَةٌ of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ, (S, K, * TA,)<br>\
unless it be from إِنَّ, as first stated above: (S,<br>\
TA:) AZ used to say that it is مَئِتَّةٌ, with ت,<br>\
(S, K, * TA,) meaning a thing (lit. a place) meet,<br>\
fit, or proper, or worthy or deserving, and the like;<br>\
of the measure مَفْعِلَةٌ, [originally مَأْتِتَةٌ,] from أَتَّهُ<br>\
meaning “he overcame him with an argument<br>\
or the like:” (S, K, TA:) but some say that<br>\
it is of the measure فَعِلَّةٌ, from مَأَنَ meaning<br>\
اِحْتَمَلَ: see art. مأن. (K in that art.) You say<br>\
also, هُوَ مَئِنَّةٌ لِلْخَيْرِ, from إِنَّ, He is a person fit,<br>\
or proper, for one&#39;s saying of him, Verily he is<br>\
good; and in like manner, مَعْسَاةٌ, from عَسَى, as<br>\
meaning “a person fit, or proper, for one&#39;s saying of him, May-be he will do good.” (A, TA.)<br>\
And إِنَّهُ لَمَئِنَّةٌ أَنْ يَكُونَ كَذَا Verily it is meet,<br>\
fit, or proper, for one&#39;s saying of it, Verily it<br>\
is thus; or is worthy, or deserving, of one&#39;s saying &amp;c.: or verily it is a thing meet, fit, or<br>\

you say of two, and of more, and of a female:<br>\
but مَئِنَّةٌ may be of the measure فَعِلَّةٌ [from مأن],<br>\
i. e. a triliteral-radical word. (M.) ―<br>\
