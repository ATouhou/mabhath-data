أرّث, (M, A,) inf. n. تَأْرِيثٌ, (T, S, K,) He<br>\
kindled, or lighted, a fire; or made it to burn,<br>\
burn up, burn brightly or fiercely, blaze, or<br>\

اَرُثَ,<br>\
(T, K,) inf. n. أَرْثٌ; (K; in a copy of the A<br>\
إِرْثٌ;) but this [says SM] no leading lexicographer has mentioned, nor have I found any<br>\
example of it. (TA.) [See also وَرَّثَ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
تأريث also signifies (tropical:)  The exciting discord, dissension, disorder, strife, quarrelling, or animosity,<br>\
between a people. (S, K.) You say, أرَث بَيْنَ<br>\
القَوْمِ, (M, A,) and أرّث بَيْنَهُمُ الشَّرَّ وَالحَرْبَ, (T,<br>\
TA,) (tropical:)  He excited discord, dissension, disorder,<br>\
strife, quarrelling, or animosity, between, or<br>\
among, the people, or company of men; (T, M,<br>\
A;) kindled the fire of discord, dissension, &amp;c.,<br>\
[or evil, and war,] between them, or among them.<br>\
(T, * TA.)<br>\

تَأَرَّثَتِ النَّارُ The fire became kindled, or<br>\
lighted; or it burned, burned up, burned brightly<br>\
or fiercely, blazed, or flamed. (S, M, K.)<br>\
إِرْثٌ, originally وِرْثٌ, (T, S,) Inheritance; or a<br>\
person&#39;s obtaining possession of property left to<br>\
him by one who has died. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b2-  An inheritance, or a heritage; what is inherited. (S, A,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  An old condition, case, or state of things,<br>\
which the last has inherited from the first. (S, A,<br>\
K.) So in the phrase, هُوَ عَلَى إِرْثٍ مِنْ كَذَا [He<br>\
is conforming, in respect of such a thing, with an<br>\
old state of things, or an old usage, which he has<br>\
inherited from his ancestors]. (S.) And in the<br>\
following ex., from a trad., إِنَّكُمْ عَلَى إِرْثٍ مِنْ<br>\
إِرْثِ أَبِيكُمْ إِبْرَاهِيمَ [Verily ye are conforming with<br>\
an old state of things, or an old usage, which ye<br>\
have inherited from your father Abraham], the<br>\
meaning is, that his religion was their heritage.<br>\
(T, * TA.) [See also وِرْثٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  A remainder, or<br>\
what remains, (M, L, K,) of a thing, (K,) or of<br>\
the original of a thing: (M, L:) pl. إِرَاثٌ. (L.)<br>\

-b5-  And [hence, app.,] Ashes. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also<br>\
Origin, race, or stock. (S, M, A, K.) You say,<br>\
هُوَ فِى إِرْثِ صِدْقٍ He is of an excellent origin,<br>\
race, or stock. (S.) And إِنَّهُ لَفِى إِرْثِ مَجْدٍ<br>\
[Verily he is of a glorious origin, race, or stock];<br>\
as also إِرْفِ مَجْدٍ, by a change of letters. (Yaa-<br>\
koob, M.) Accord. to IAar, إِرْثٌ relates to حَسَب<br>\
[or grounds of pretension to respect or honour, on<br>\
account of one&#39;s ancestors&#39; or one&#39;s own deeds or<br>\
qualities, &amp;c.]; and وِرْثٌ, to property, or wealth.<br>\

but in the K “and”) tinder, and the like, prepared for fire; (M, L, K;) [as also ↓ إِرَاثَةٌ and<br>\
↓ أُرْثَةٌ; or these two words signify a means of<br>\
kindling or inflaming; as will be seen from what<br>\
follows:] or a lump of the dung of a horse or the like,<br>\
or a similar thing, with which one kindles a fire; as<br>\
also ↓ أُرْثَةٌ: (A:) or this last signifies dung of<br>\
camels or horses or the like, (S, K,) or wood, or a<br>\

by the ashes, (S, K,) or buried in them, (T,) for<br>\
the time when it may be wanted (T, S, K) for<br>\
fuel. (T.) It is said in a prov., mentioned in<br>\
the collection of Meyd, العَدَاوَةِ ↓ النَّمِيمَةُ<br>\
[Calumny, or slander, is a means of kindling, or<br>\
inflaming, enmity]. (TA: but in Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Prov., ii. 773, in the place of اراثة, we find<br>\
↓ أُرْثَة.)<br>\
