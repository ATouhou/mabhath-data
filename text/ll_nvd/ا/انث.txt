اَنڤثَ [أَنُثَ, aor.<br>\
اَنُثَ, inf. n. أَنَاثَةٌ and أُنُوثَةٌ, (see the<br>\
former of these two ns. below,) It was, or became,<br>\

And hence, أَنُثَتْ, said of land (أَرْض), (tropical:)  It was,<br>\

-b3-  Hence also,]<br>\
أَنُثَ, said of iron, (tropical:)  It was, or became, soft.<br>\
(Golius, from the larger of two editions of the<br>\
lexicon entitled مرقاة اللغة.) Accord. to IAar,<br>\
softness is the primary signification. (M.) [But<br>\
accord. to the A, the second and third of the<br>\
meanings given above are tropical: (see أَنِيثٌ:)<br>\
and the verb in the first of the senses here assigned<br>\
to it, if not proper, is certainly what is termed<br>\
حَقِيقَة عُرْفِيَّة, i. e., conventionally regarded as<br>\
proper.]<br>\
2<br>\
أنّثهُ, inf. n. تَأْنِيثٌ, He made it (namely, a<br>\
noun [&amp;c.], S and Msb) feminine; (S, M, L,<br>\
Msb;) he attached to it, or to that which was syntactically dependent upon it, the sign of the feminine gender. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, rendered him<br>\
effeminate. (KL.) [See the pass. part. n., below.]<br>\

effeminately] towards him; as also له ↓ تأنّث.<br>\
(K, TA.) And أنّث فِى أَمْرِهِ, inf. n. as above, (T,<br>\
A,) (tropical:)  He acted gently in his affair: (A:) or he<br>\
applied himself gently to his affair: (T:) and<br>\
some say, فى امره ↓ تأنّث, meaning he acted<br>\
effeminately in his affair. (T, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
آنَثَتْ, (S, M, A, K,) inf. n. إِينَاثٌ, (K,) She<br>\
(a woman) brought forth a female, (S, A, K,)<br>\
or females. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] (assumed tropical:)  It (land,<br>\
أَرْض,) was, or became, such as is termed مِئْنَاث.<br>\
(A.)<br>\
5<br>\

أُنْثَي Female; feminine; of the female, or<br>\
feminine, sex, or gender; contr. ?? ذَكَرٌ: (T, S,<br>\
M:) an epithet applied to anything of that sex or<br>\
gender: (T:) IAar asserts, that a woman is termed<br>\
انثي from the phrase بَلَدٌ أَنِيثٌ, q. v, because of<br>\
her softness; she being more soft than a man:<br>\
(M, L:) [but see the observation at the end of<br>\
the first paragraph of this art.:] the pl. is إِنَاثٌ;<br>\
(T, S, M, A, Msb, K;) and sometimes one says<br>\
أُنُثٌ, as though it were pl. of إِنَاثٌ; (S;) or it is<br>\
[truly] pl. of إِنَاثٌ, like as نُمُرٌ is of نِمَارٌ; (T;)<br>\
and أَنَاثَى, (T, A, Msb, K,) which last occurs in<br>\
poetry. (T.) You say, هٰذَا طَائِرٌ وَ أُنْثَاهُ [This is a<br>\
(male) bird and his female]: not أُنْثَاتُهُ. (ISk, T.)<br>\
In the Kur iv. 117, I&#39;Ab reads أُثُنًا [in the place<br>\
of أُنُثًا or إِنَاثًا]; and Fr says that it is pl. of<br>\
وَثَنٌ, the و in وُثُنٌ being changed into أ as in<br>\
أُقِّتَتٌ [for وُقِّتَتٌ]. (T, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اِمْرَأَةٌ أَنْثَى (tropical:)  [A feminine woman,] means a perfect woman; (T, A, K;)<br>\
a woman being thus termed in praise; like as a<br>\
man is termed رَجُلٌ ذَكَرٌ. (T, A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [The pl.]<br>\
إِنَاثٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  Inanimate things; (Lh, T,<br>\
M, K;) as trees and stones (T, K) and wood.<br>\
(T.) In the passage of the Kur mentioned above,<br>\
إِنَاثًا is said to have this meaning: (T, M:) [or it<br>\
there means females; for] Fr says that El-Lát and<br>\
El-&#39;Ozzà and the like were said by the Arabs to<br>\
be feminine divinities. (T, TA.) ―<br>\

[which is said by some to mean the scrotum; but<br>\
the former is generally, though app. not always,<br>\
meant by الانثيان]. (M, Mgh, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
The two ears: (As, T, S, M, A, Mgh, K:) because<br>\
they are of the fem. gender. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\

-b6-<br>\
And أُنْثَيَا الفَرَسِ (assumed tropical:)  The inner parts (الرَّبَلَتَانِ) of<br>\
the thighs of the horse. (M, L.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And الأُنْثَي<br>\

مَنْجَنِيق; because the latter word is [generally] of<br>\
the feminine gender. (M.)<br>\
