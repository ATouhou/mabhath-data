أَبَنَهُ, aor.<br>\
اَبُنَ and<br>\
اَبِنَ, inf. n. أَبْنٌ, He made him<br>\
an object of imputation, or suspected him: and<br>\
he found fault with him, or blamed him: (M:)<br>\
or he cast a foul, or an evil, imputation upon him.<br>\
(IAar, T.) You say, أَبَنَهُ بِشَىْءٍ, (S, K,) or بِشَّرٍ<br>\
(as in one copy of the S,) or بِخَيْرٍوَشَّرٍ, (Lh, M,)<br>\
aor. as above, (Lh, S, M, K,) and so the inf. n.,<br>\
(Lh, M,) He made him an object of imputation,<br>\
or suspected him, (Lh, S, M, K,) of a thing, (S,<br>\
K,) or of evil, (S, accord. to one copy,) or of good,<br>\
and evil: (Lh, M:) and ↓ أبّنهُ signifies the same.<br>\
(M.) And بِخَيْرٍ ↓ فُلَانٌ يُؤَبَّنُ, or بِشَّرٍ, Such a<br>\
one is made an object of imputation, or suspected,<br>\
of good, or of evil: (AA, * Lh, T [as in the TT;<br>\
but perhaps يُؤَبَّنُ is a mistranscription for يُؤْبَنُ;<br>\
for it is immediately added, فَهُوَ مَأْبُونٌ:]) when,<br>\
however, you say يؤبن [i. e. يُؤْبَنُ or ↓ يُؤَبَّنٌ]<br>\
alone, it relates to evil only. (AA, T. [But<br>\
see 2.]) And فُلَانٌ يَؤَبَنُ بِكَذَا, or ↓ يُؤَبَّنُ, Such a<br>\
one is evil spoken of by the imputation of such<br>\
a thing. (S, accord. to different copies.) And<br>\
it is said respecting the assembly of the Prophet,<br>\
فِيهِ الحُرَمُ, ↓ لَا تُؤَبَّنُ, (T, and so in a copy of the<br>\
S,) or لا تُؤْبَنُ, (so in some copies of the S,) i. e.<br>\
Women (T) shall not be mentioned in an evil<br>\
manner therein: (T, S:) or shall not have evil<br>\
imputations cast upon them, nor be found fault<br>\
with, nor shall that which is foul be said of them,<br>\
nor that which ought not, of things whereof one<br>\
should be ashamed. (IAar, T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, and<br>\
↓ أبّنهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَأْبِينٌ, (K,) He found fault<br>\
with him, or blamed him, to his face; (M, K;)<br>\
and he upbraided him, or reproached him. (M.)<br>\
2<br>\
أبّن الشَّىْءَ, (AZ, S,) inf. n. تَأْبِينٌ, (K,) He<br>\
watched, or observed, the thing; or he expected it,<br>\
or waited for it. (AZ, S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أبّن الأَثَرَ, (M,)<br>\
inf. n. as above, (As, T, S, K,) He followed the<br>\
traces, or footprints, or footsteps, (As, T, S, M,<br>\
K,) of a thing; (As, S, K;) as also ↓ تأبّن.<br>\
(K.) And hence the next signification. (As,<br>\
T.)<br>\
-A2-  أبّن الرَّجُلَ, (S, M,) inf. n. as above, (Sh,<br>\
T, S, K,) He praised the man, or spoke well<br>\
of him, (Sh, Th, T, S, M, K,) after his death,<br>\
(Th, S, M, K,) or in death and in life, (Sh, T,)<br>\
used in poetry to signify praise of the living;<br>\
(M;) and wept for him: (S:) he praised him;<br>\
and enumerated, or recounted, his good qualities<br>\
or actions: you say, لَمْ يَزَلَ يُقَرِّظُ أَحْيَاكُمْ وَيُؤَبِّنُ<br>\
مَوْتَاكُمْ [He ceased not to eulogize your living<br>\
and to praise your dead]: (Z, TA:) for he who<br>\
praises the dead traces his [good] deeds. (As,<br>\
T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, in six places.<br>\

تَاَبَّنَ see 2.<br>\
اِبْنٌ: see art. بني.<br>\
أُبْنَةٌ A knot in wood, or in a branch; (S, M,<br>\
K;) or in a staff, or stick; (T;) and in a bow,<br>\
(TA,) [i. e.] the place of the shooting forth of a<br>\
branch in a bow, (M,) which is a fault therein;<br>\
(TA;) and in a rope, or cord: (M in art. اثل:)<br>\
pl. أُبَنٌ. (T, S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (M,) (tropical:)  A fault,<br>\
defect, or blemish, (T, M, K, TA,) in one&#39;s<br>\
grounds of pretension to respect, (T, TA,) and in<br>\
speech, or language. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  Particularly<br>\
The enormity that is committed with one who is<br>\
termed مَأْبُون. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  Rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite: (K, TA:) and enmity:<br>\
pl. as above. (TA.) You say, بَيْنَهُمْ أُبَنٌ (tropical:)  (S,<br>\
TA) Between them are enmities. (S.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also<br>\
The [part called] غَلْصَمَة [meaning the epiglottis]<br>\
of a camel. (M, K.)<br>\
اِبْنَةٌ: see art. بنى<br>\
إِبَّانٌ The time of a thing; (T, S, M, K, and<br>\
Msb in art. اب;) the season of a thing; (Msb in<br>\
that art.;) the time of the preparing, or making<br>\
ready, of a thing; (Mgh in that art.;) as, for<br>\
instance, of fruit, (S, Mgh, Msb,) of the fresh ripe<br>\
dates, and of the gathering of fruits, and of heat<br>\
or cold: (T.:) or the first of a thing. (M, K.)<br>\
You say, أَخَذَ الشَّىْءَ بِإِبَّانِهِ He took the thing in<br>\
its time: or in, or with, the first thereof. (M.)<br>\
The ن is radical, so that it is of the measure فِعَّالٌ;<br>\
or, as some say, augmentative, so that it is of the<br>\
measure فِعْلَانٌ. (TA.) [See art. اب.]<br>\
مُؤَبَّنٌ occurs as meaning Dead, or dying; i. e.,<br>\
[properly,] wept for. (S.) [See 2.]<br>\
مُؤَبِّنٌ A praiser of the dead; because he traces<br>\
his [good] deeds. (As, T.)<br>\
مَأْبُونٌ Made an object of imputation, or suspected, of evil: thus when used alone: otherwise<br>\
you add بِخَيْرٍ [of good], and بِشَّرٍ [of evil]. (M,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, [A catamite;] one with whom<br>\
enormous wickedness is committed; (TA;) i. q.<br>\
مُخَنَّثٌ. (Idem, voce دُعْبُوثٌ.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also One who<br>\
is imprisoned; because suspected of a foul fault,<br>\
or crime. (T.)<br>\
ابنس, accord. to the Msb; or بنس, accord. to<br>\
the TA.<br>\
آبِنُوسٌ, with medd to the ا and kesr to the ب,<br>\
(TA,) or with damm to the ب, [i. e. آبُنُوسٌ, and<br>\
by some written آبَنُوسٌ,] or with the بquiescent,<br>\
[i. e. أَبْنُوسٌ,] and without و, [app. أَبْنُسٌ,] (Msb,)<br>\
[Ebony;] a thing well known, which is brought<br>\
from India: an arabicized word: (Msb [in<br>\
which is added the proper Arabic appellation;<br>\
but the word in my copy of that work is imperfectly written; app. جعفر; which, however, does<br>\
not seem to be the word intended:]) some say<br>\
that it is the same as سَاسَم: others, that it is<br>\
different therefrom: and respecting the measure<br>\
of the word, authors differ. (TA.)<br>\
