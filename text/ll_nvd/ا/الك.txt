أَلَكَ الِلّجَامَ, (ISd, K,) [aor.<br>\
اَلُكَ or<br>\
اَلِكَ,] inf. n.<br>\
أَلْكٌ, (ISd, TA,) He (a horse) chewed, or champed,<br>\
the bit; syn. عَلَكَهُ. (ISd, K.) One says, of a<br>\
horse, يألكُ اللُّجُمَ He chews, or champs, the bits:<br>\
but the verb commonly known is يَلُوكَ, or يَعْلُكُ.<br>\
(Lth.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, accord. to some, (see أَلُوكٌ,)]<br>\
أَلَكَ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ, (Msb, TA,) aor.<br>\
اَلِكَ, inf. n. أَلْكٌ<br>\
and أُلُوكٌ, (Msb,) He acted as a messenger (تَرَسَّلَ)<br>\
between the people. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And أَلَكَهُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
اَلِكَ, inf. n. أَلْكٌ, He conveyed, or communicated,<br>\
to him a message. (Kr.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And أَلَكَ He sent.<br>\
(IB in art. لوك.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَلِكْنِى is from أَلَكَ signifying “he sent;”<br>\
and is originally أَأْلِكْنِى; the [second] hemzeh<br>\
being transposed and placed after the ل, it<br>\
becomes أَلْئِكْنِى; then the hemzeh has its vowel<br>\
transferred to the ل and is thrown out; as is<br>\
done in the case of مَلَكٌ, which is originally مَأْلَكٌ,<br>\
then مَلْأَكٌ, and then مَلَكٌ: (IB in art. لوك:) it<br>\
means Be thou my messenger; and bear thou<br>\
my message; and is often used by the poets.<br>\
(S in art. لوك.) Accord. to IAmb, one says,<br>\
أَلِكْنِى إِلَى فُلَانٍ, meaning send thou me to such<br>\
a one: [but I do not know any instance in<br>\
which this meaning is applicable:] and the<br>\
original form is أَلْئِكْنِى; or, if from الأَلُوكُ, the<br>\
original form is أَأْلِكْنِى: and he also says that<br>\
it means be thou my messenger to such a one.<br>\
(TA.) One says also, أَلِكْنِى إِلَيْهَا بِرِسَالَةٍ, which<br>\
should properly mean Send thou me to her with<br>\
a message: but it is an inverted phrase; since<br>\
the meaning is, be thou my messenger to her<br>\
with this message [or rather with a message]:<br>\
and أَلِكْنِى إِلَيْهَا بِالسَّلَامِ i. e. convey thou, or communicate thou, to her my salutation; or be thou<br>\
my messenger to her [with salutation]: and sometimes this [prep.] ب is suppressed, so that one<br>\
says, أَلِكْنِى إِلَيْهَا السَّلَامَ: sometimes, also, the<br>\
person sent is he to whom the message is sent;<br>\
as in the saying, أَلِكْنِى إِلَيْكَ السَّلَامَ [virtually<br>\
meaning receive thou my salutation; but literally]<br>\
be thou my messenger to thyself with salutation.<br>\
(TA.) Lh mentions the phrase أَلَكْتُهُ إِلَيْهِ, with<br>\
respect to a message, aor. أُلِيكُهُ, inf. n. إِلَاكَهٌ;<br>\
in which case, the hemzeh [in the aor. and inf. n.]<br>\
is converted into a letter of prolongation. (TA<br>\
in art. لأك.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَاَلَّكَ see أَلُوكٌ.<br>\
10<br>\
استألك مَأْلُكَتَهُ He bore, or conveyed, his<br>\
message; (K;) as also استلأك. (TA.)<br>\
أَلُوكٌ A thing that is eaten [or rather chewed,<br>\
as will be seen below]: so in the phrases,<br>\
هذَا أَلُوكُ صِدْقٍ like عَلُوجُ صِدْقٍ and عَلُوكُ صِدْقٍ<br>\
[This is an excellent thing that is chewed], and<br>\
مَا تَلَوَّكْتُ بِأَلُوكٍ  [or بِأَلُوكٍ ↓ مَا تَأَلَّكْتُ (K in art.<br>\
علج)] like مَا تَعَلَّجْتُ بِعَلُوجٍ [app. meaning<br>\
I have not occupied myself in chewing with anything that is chewed]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,<br>\
accord. to some,] A message, or communication<br>\
sent from one person or party to another; (Lth,<br>\
S, M, K, &amp;c.; [in the CK, after الرِّسالَةُ, by<br>\
which الأَلُوكُ is explained in the K &amp;c., we find<br>\
قِبَلَ المَلِكِ مُشْتَقٌّ منهُ, in which the first two<br>\
words should be قِيلَ المَلَكُ, as in other copies of<br>\
the K and in the TA; and الاُلُوكُ is erroneously<br>\
put, in the CK, for الأَلُوكُ;]) said by Lth and<br>\
ISd to be so called because it is [as it were]<br>\
chewed in the mouth; (TA;) as also ↓ أَلُوكَهٌ<br>\
(ISd, Sgh, K) and ↓ مَأْلُكَةٌ (Lth, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.)<br>\
and ↓ مَأْلَكَةٌ (Msb, K) and ↓ مَأْلُكٌ: (S, M, Msb.<br>\
K, &amp;c.:) accord. to Kr, (TA,) this last is the<br>\
only word of the measure مَفْعُلٌ: (K, TA:) but<br>\
accord. to Sb and Akh, there is no word of this<br>\
measure: (TA:) [i. e. there is none originally<br>\
of this measure:] other instances have been mentioned; namely, مَكْرُمٌ and مَعُونٌ [originally<br>\
مَعْوُنٌ] and مَقْبُرٌ and مَهْلُكٌ and مَيْسُرٌ, which last<br>\
occurs in the Kur [ii. 280], accord. to one reading, in the words فَنَظِرَةٌ إِلَى مَيْسُرِهِ; but it is said<br>\
that each of these, and مَأْلُكٌ also, may be regarded<br>\
as originally with ة; or, accord. to AHei, each<br>\
is [virtually, though not in the language of<br>\
the grammarians,] a pl. of the same with ة;<br>\
(MF, TA;) and Akh says the same with respect<br>\
to مَكْرُمٌ and مَعُونٌ: (TA:) Seer says that each<br>\
is curtailed of ة by poetic licence; but this assertion will not apply to مَيْسُرٌ, as it occurs in the<br>\
Kur. (MF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَلُوكٌ also signifies A messenger. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K. [In the CK here follows, والمأْلُوْكُ والمَأْلُقُ: but the right reading is<br>\
وَالمَأْلُوكُ المَأْلُوقُ, as in other copies and in the<br>\
TA.])<br>\
أَلُوكَهٌ: see أَلُوكٌ.<br>\
مَأْلَكٌ is said to be the original form of مَلَكٌ<br>\
[An angel; so called because he conveys, or<br>\
communicates, the message from God; (K, * TA,<br>\
in art. لأك;)] derived from أَلُوكٌ; (Msb, K, TA;<br>\
[but in the CK is a mistake here, pointed out<br>\
above, voce أَلُوكٌ;]) so that the measure of مَلَكٌ<br>\
is مَعَلٌ: (Msb:) مَلَكٌ is both sing. and pl.: Ks<br>\
says that it is originally مَأْلَكٌ, from أَلُوكٌ signifying<br>\
“a message;” then, by transposition, مَلْأَكٌ, a<br>\
form also in use; and then, in consequence of<br>\
frequency of usage, the hemzeh is suppressed,<br>\
so that it becomes مَلَكٌ; but in forming the pl.,<br>\
they restore it to مَلْأَكٌ, saying مَلَائِكَةٌ, and مَلَائِكُ<br>\
also: (S in art. ملك:) or, accord. to some, it is<br>\
from لَأَكَ “he sent;” so that the measure of مَلَكٌ<br>\
is مَفَلٌ: and there are other opinions respecting<br>\
it: (Msb:) some say that its م is a radical: see<br>\
art. ملك. (TA in art. لأك.)<br>\
مَأْلُكٌ: see أَلُوكٌ.<br>\
مَأْلَكَةٌ: see أَلُوكٌ.<br>\
مَأْلَكَةٌ: see أَلُوكٌ.<br>\
