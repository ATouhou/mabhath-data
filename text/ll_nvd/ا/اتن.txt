(M.) The saying, كَانَ حِمَارَّا فَاسْتَأْتَنَ, said of a<br>\
man, [lit.] signifies [He was a he ass,] and he<br>\
became a she ass; meaning (assumed tropical:)  he was mighty, or<br>\
of high condition, [like the wild he-ass,] and he<br>\
became base, abject, or vile. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S,<br>\

أُتْنٌ and (quasi-pl. n., M) ↓ مَأْتُونَآءُ. (S, M, K.)<br>\

A large, round mass of rock, which, when it is in<br>\
shallow water, is called أَتَانُ الضَّحلِ; and a she<br>\
camel is likened thereto, in respect of her hardness: (S:) or أَتَانُ الضَّحلِ signifies a large mass<br>\
of rock projecting from the water. (T:) or a<br>\
mass of rock, (M, K, TA,) large and round, in<br>\

The [piece of wood called] قَاعِدَة [which is one<br>\
of four forming the support] of the فَوْدَج [more<br>\
commonly called هَوْدَج, q. v.]: pl. آتُنٌ, (K,<br>\
TA,) with medd. (TA: [but in the CK اُتُنٌ.])<br>\
إِتَانٌ: see أَتَانٌ, in two places.<br>\
أَتُونٌ (T, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and أَتُّونٌ, (K,) or,<br>\
accord. to J, (Msb,) it is thus, with teshdeed, but<br>\
pronounced without teshdeed by the vulgar, (S,<br>\
Msb,) A certain place in which fire is kindled,<br>\
(S, Mgh,) called in Persian كُلَخْن [or كُلْخَنْ],<br>\
pertaining to a bath: and metaphorically applied<br>\
to (tropical:)  that in which bricks are baked, and called in<br>\
Persian تُونَقْ and دَاشُوزَنْ [or simply تُونْ and<br>\
دَاشْ]: (Mgh:) accord. to Az, (Msb,) it is that<br>\
of the bath, and of the place in which gypsum is<br>\
made: (T, Msb:) or the trench, hollow, or pit,<br>\
of the جَيَّارَ [or lime-burner, (in the CK, erroneously, the خَبّاز,]) and of the preparer of<br>\
gypsum; (M, K, TA;) and the like: (K:) the<br>\
pl. [said in the TA to be of the latter, but it is<br>\
implied in the T and M and Mgh that it is of the<br>\
former,] is أَتَاتِينُ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, [in<br>\
the CK, erroneously, اَتانِيْنُ,]) by common consent of the Arabs, (Mgh,) with two تs, (T,)<br>\
accord. to Fr, who says that they sometimes<br>\
double a letter in the pl. when they do not double<br>\
it in the sing., (T,) and accord. to IJ, who says<br>\
that it seems as though they changed أَتُونٌ to<br>\
أَتُّونٌ; (M;) and [of أَتُونٌ, as is said in the TA<br>\
and implied in the M,] أُتُنٌ. (M, K.) [J says<br>\
that] it is said to be post-classical; (S;) [and ISd<br>\
says,] I do not think it to be Arabic. (M.)<br>\
