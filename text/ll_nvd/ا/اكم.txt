(O, K.) You say, أَكَّمَتِ المَرْأَةٌ The woman was<br>\
large in the كَفَل. (TK.)<br>\

استأكم It (a place) became what are termed<br>\
أَكَم, q. v. (K.)<br>\

أَكَمَةٌ A hill, or mound, syn. تَلٌّ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
[in an absolute sense, or] of what is termed قُفّ<br>\
[q. v.], (K,) or, as in the M, (TA,) of a single<br>\
collection of stones: or it is inferior to mountains:<br>\
or a place that is more elevated than what is<br>\
around it, and is rugged, not to the degree of<br>\
being stone: (K:) or an isolated mountain:<br>\
(K voce جَبَلٌ:) or an eminence like what is<br>\
termed رَابِيَة: a collection of stones in one place,<br>\
sometimes rugged and sometimes not rugged:<br>\
(Msb:) or i. q. قُفٌّ, except that the اكمة is<br>\
higher and greater: (ISh, TA:) or what is<br>\
higher than the قُفّ, compact and round, rising<br>\
into the sky, abounding with stones: (TA:) pl.<br>\
أَكَمَاتٌ (S, Msb) and ↓ أَكَمٌ, [or this is rather<br>\
a coll. gen. n. of which أَكَمَةٌ is the n. un.,] (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) and إِكَامٌ, (K, TA,) or this is pl. of<br>\
أَكَمٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) and أُكُمٌ, (K, TA,) or this<br>\
is pl. of إِكَامٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) and آكَامٌ [a pl.<br>\
of pauc.], (K,) or this is pl. of أُكُمٌ, (S, Msb,<br>\
TA,) and آكُمٌ [which is also a pl. of pauc.],<br>\
(IJ, K,) or this is a pl. of أَكَمٌ: (TA:) IHsh<br>\
says that أَكَمٌ is the only word like ثَمَرٌ in its<br>\
series of pls.; for its sing. [or n. un.] is أَكَمَةٌ,<br>\

and the pl. of this is إِكَامٌ, and the pl. of this<br>\
is أُكُمٌ, and the pl. of this is آكَامٌ, and the pl.<br>\
of this is أَكَامِيمُ [or أَوَاكِيمُ?]. (MF in art. ثمر.) It<br>\
is said in a prov., used in ridiculing any one who<br>\
has told of his committing some fault, not desiring<br>\
to reveal it, جُسْتُمُونِى وَوَرَآءَ الأَكَمَةِ مَا وَرَآءَهَا [in<br>\
which I think the first word to be a mistranscription, for جِئْتُمُونِى, and the literal meaning to be,<br>\
Ye have come to me; but behind the hill is what<br>\
is behind it]: related on the authority of Zeyd<br>\
Ibn-Kethweh. (TA.) And one says, لَا تَبُلْ عَلَى<br>\
أَكَمةٍ, meaning (tropical:)  Publish not what is secret of<br>\
thine affair. (TA.)<br>\

syn. عَجِيزَةٌ: (S:) or a portion of flesh on the<br>\
head of the وَرِك [or haunch]; one of two such<br>\
portions: (Zj in his “Khalk el-Insán,“ and K:)<br>\
or these are two protuberances of flesh on the<br>\
heads of the upper parts of the وَرِكَانِ [or<br>\
haunches]; on the right and left: (TA:) or<br>\
they are two portions of flesh conjoining the عَجُز<br>\
[or buttocks] and the مَتْنَانِ [or two portions of<br>\
flesh and sinew next the back-bone, on each<br>\
side]; (K, TA;) or, as in the Nh, conjoining<br>\
the عَجْب [or rump-bone] and the متنان: or<br>\
two portions of flesh at the root of the وَرِكَاِ:<br>\
(TA:) pl. مَآكِمُ. (S, K.) Lh mentions the<br>\
saying, إِنَّهُ لَعَظِيمُ المآكِمِ [Verily he is big in<br>\
the hinder parts]; as though they called every<br>\
portion thereof مأكم. (TA.) And one says in<br>\
reviling a person, يَا ابِنَ أَحْمَرِ المَأْكَمَةِ, meaning<br>\
O son of him who is red in the سَفِلَةِ. (TA.)<br>\
