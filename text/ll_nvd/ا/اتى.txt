Hudheyl, يَأْت, without ى; (S;) and أَتَيْتُهُ, (T, S,<br>\

as is done in خُذْ and كُلْ and مُرْ; (IJ, M;) inf.<br>\
n. إِتْيَانٌ, (T, S, * M, Mgh, Msb, K,) or this is a<br>\
simple subst., (Msb.) and إِتْيَانَةٌ, (M, K,) which<br>\
should not be used as an inf. n. of un., unless by<br>\
a bad poetic licence, (Lth, T,) and أَتْىٌ (T, S, M,<br>\

(S:) for which reason, we assign the generality of<br>\
the words mentioned in art. اتو to the present art.<br>\
also. (M.) [Accord. to the authorities here indicated for the signification of أَتَى, this verb and جَآءَ<br>\
are syn.: some attempt to distinguish them; but<br>\
contradict one another in so doing: the slight<br>\
distinctions that exist between them will be best<br>\
seen by a comparison of the exs. in this art. with<br>\
those in art. جيأ:] accord. to Er-Rághib, the proper<br>\
[or primary] signification of الإِتْيَانُ is The coming<br>\
with ease. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَتَاهَا, (Mgh, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\

an expression in the Kur xxvi. 165. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
أَتَى القَوْمَ [He came to the people: and hence,] he<br>\
asserted his relationship to the people, not being<br>\
of them. (Msb.) [See أَتِىُّ in art. اتو.] ―<br>\
-b4-  أَتَي بِهِ<br>\
[He came with, or brought, him, and it; or] he<br>\
made him (a man), and it (a thing, such, for instance, as property), to come. (Kull.) [See also<br>\
4: and see, in what follows, other significations<br>\
of أَتَى trans. by means of بِ. Hence, أَتَى بِوَلَدٍ<br>\
He begot a child, or children. And أَتَتْ بِهِ She<br>\
brought him forth; gave birth to him.] Accord.<br>\
to Aboo-Is-hák, the meaning of the words in the<br>\
Kur [ii. 143] أَيْنَمَا تَكُونُوا يَأْتِ بِكُمُ اللّٰهُ جَمِيعًا is,<br>\
Wherever ye be, God will bring you all back unto<br>\

-b5-  أَتَى الأَمْرَ [He<br>\
entered into, engaged in, or occupied himself with,<br>\

K;) and in like manner, الذَّنْبَ, [and بَالذَّنْبِ,]<br>\

Kur [ix. 54], وَلَا يَأْتُونَ الصَّلَاةَ إِلَّا وَهُمْ كُسَالَى,<br>\
meaning And they do not enter into, or engage in,<br>\
prayer, unless when they are heavy, or sluggish.<br>\
(TA.) And you say, أَتَى الفَاحِشَهَ, [and بِالفَاحِشَةِ,<br>\
(see Kur iv. 23 and lxv. 1,)] He entered into,<br>\
engaged in, or occupied himself with, [or he did,<br>\
or committed,] that which was excessively foul or<br>\
evil. (TA.) And أَتَى بِالجَيِّدِ مِنْ قَوْلٍ أَوْ فِعْلٍ<br>\
[He said, gave utterance to, uttered, or expressed,<br>\
or he brought to pass, did, or effected, what was<br>\
good, or excellent; he said, or did, well, or excel-lently]. (Msb in art. جود.) And أَتَى بِجَرْىِ بَعْدَ<br>\
جَرْىٍ[He (a horse) performed, or fetched, run<br>\
after run]. (S in art. تأم, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b6-  وَلَا يُفْلِحُ السَّاحِرُ<br>\
حَيْثُ أَتَى[in the Kur xx. 72] means حَيْثُ كَانَ<br>\
[And the enchanter shall not prosper where he is,<br>\
or wherever he may be]; (M, Bd, K;) and where<br>\
he cometh: (Bd:) or حَيْثُ أَتَى بِسِحْرِهِ[where he<br>\
cometh with his enchantment; or where he performeth his enchantment]: (Jel:) and it is said to<br>\
mean that where the enchanter is, he must be<br>\
slain: such is the doctrine of the lawyers. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  Z mentions that أَتَىoccurs in the sense of صَارَ<br>\
[He, or it, became; like as we sometimes say,<br>\
he, or it, came, or came to be]; like جَآءَin the<br>\
saying, جَآءَ البِنَآءُ مُحْكَمًا. (Kull.) [So you say,<br>\
البِنَآءُ مُحْكَمًاThe building became, or came to<br>\
be, firm, strong, or compact.] ―<br>\
-b8-  The saying, in<br>\
the Kur [xvi. 1], أَتَى أَمْرُ آللّٰهِ فَلَا تَسْتَعْجِلُوهُmeans<br>\
[The threatened punishment ordained of God hath<br>\
approached: therefore desire not ye to hasten it:]<br>\
its coming hath approached. (TA.) [And in like<br>\
manner,] أُتِىَ فُلَانٌ, like عُنِىَ, means Such a one<br>\
was approached by the enemy come in sight of<br>\
him. (K.) أُتِيتَ يَا فُلَانٌ[Thou art approached<br>\
&amp;c., O such a one,] is said when one is warned of<br>\
an enemy that has come in sight of him. (Sgh,<br>\
TA.) And أَتَى عَلَيْهِمُ العَدُوُّmeans The enemy came<br>\
to them, [or came down upon them, for, as MF<br>\
observes, أَتَىwhen trans. by means of عَلَىseems<br>\
to imply the meaning of نَزَلَ,] overcoming, or<br>\
overpowering, them. (Bd in xviii. 40.) ―<br>\
-b9-  Hence,<br>\
أَتَى عَلَيْهِ[and أَتَاهُ, as will be seen by what follows,] (assumed tropical:)  He destroyed him, or it. (Bd ubi suprà.)<br>\
And hence, from إِتْيَانُ العَدُوِّ, (Mgh,) أَتَى عَلَيْهِ<br>\
الدَّهْرُ(tropical:)  Time, or fortune, destroyed him. (M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K.) Destruction is meant in the Kur<br>\
[lix. 2], where it is said, فأَتاهُمُ اللّٰهُ مِنْ حيْثُ لَمْ<br>\
يَحْتَسِبُوا(assumed tropical:)  [But God brought destruction upon them<br>\
whence they did not reckon, or expect]. (EsSemeen, TA.) And it is said in the Kur [xvi. 28],<br>\
فَأَتَى اللّٰهُ بُنْيَانَهُمْ مِنَ القَوَاعِدِ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  But God<br>\
removed their building from the foundations, and<br>\
demolished it upon them, so that He destroyed<br>\
them. (TA.) أَتَى عَلَيْهِalso signifies (assumed tropical:)  He caused<br>\
it to come to an end; made an end of it; consumed it; [devoured it;] exhausted it; came to,<br>\
or reached, the end of it; namely, a thing; (Kull;)<br>\
as, for instance, what was in a bowl; (K in art.<br>\
جردم;) and what was in a vessel; (K in art.<br>\
جرجب;) like فَرَغَ مِنْهُ: (ISd cited in the TA in<br>\
art. نكش:) or i. q. مَرَّ بِهِ[which may be rendered<br>\
he went away with it; but this, as an explanation<br>\
of أَتَى عَلَيْهِ, has another meaning, which see in<br>\
what follows]. (Kull.) And one says, أُتِىَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
مِنْ مَأْمَنِهِ(assumed tropical:)  Destruction came to such a one from<br>\
the quarter whence he felt secure. (TA.) And<br>\
أُتِىَ عَلَي يَدِ فُلَانٍ(assumed tropical:)  Property belonging to such a<br>\
one perished. (T.) And يُؤْتَى دُونَهُ(assumed tropical:) He is taken<br>\
away, or carried off, and overcome. (TA.) A<br>\
poet says,<br>\
أَتَى دُونَ حُلْوِالعَيْشِ حَتَّى أَمَرَّهُ<br>\
نُكُوبٌ عَلَي آثَارِهِنَّ نُكُوبُ<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Misfortunes, in the footsteps of which<br>\
were misfortunes,] took away [what was sweet, of<br>\
life, and rendered it bitter]. (TA.) One says<br>\
also, مِنْ هٰهُنَا أُتِيَتْ, [so I find it written, but I<br>\
think that the last word should be أُتِيتَ, agreeably<br>\
with a preceding phrase from the T,] (assumed tropical:)  Hence the<br>\
trial, or affliction, came in upon thee. (Mgh.)<br>\
And أُتِىَ مِنْ جِهَةِ كَذَا, with the verb in the<br>\
passive form, (assumed tropical:)  He missed [his object in respect of<br>\
such a thing] by laying hold upon it when it<br>\
was not fit to be laid hold upon. (Msb.) And<br>\
أُتِىَ الرَّجُلُ, [also] like عُنِىَ, (assumed tropical:)  The man was<br>\
deceived, or deluded, and his faculty of sense<br>\
became altered to him, so that he imagined that to<br>\
be true which was not true. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  أَتَى عَلَيْهِ<br>\
is also syn. with مَرَّ بِهِ[meaning He, or it, (as,<br>\
for instance, a period of time,) passed by him, or<br>\
over him]. (Msb.) You say, أَتَ عَلَيْهِ حَوْلٌ[A<br>\
year passed over him; or he became a year old].<br>\

آتَاهُ, [inf. n. as below,] He requited, compensated, or recompensed, him. (M, K.) The<br>\
saying, in the Kur [xxi. 48], وَإِنْ كَانَ مِثْقَالَ<br>\
بِهَا ↓ حَبَّةٍ مِنْ خَرْدَلٍ أَتَيْنَا, some read thus, (M, *<br>\
TA,) meaning [Though it be the weight of a<br>\
grain of mustard,] we will bring it [forward for<br>\
requital]: others read بها↓ آتَيْنَا, meaning we will<br>\
give [a recompense] for it; in which case the<br>\
verb is of the measure أَفْعَلَ: or we will requite<br>\

or was of one mind or opinion with him, upon, or<br>\
respecting, the thing, or affair; I complied with<br>\

manner: (T:) the vulgar say, وَاتَيْتُهُ: (S:) this<br>\
is of the dial. of the people of El-Yemen, inf. n.<br>\
مُوَاتَاةٌ; and is the form commonly current: (Msb:)<br>\
but it should not be used, except in the dial. of<br>\
the people of El-Yemen. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, app.,<br>\
آتَىas meaning He aided; a signification mentioned by Golius, on the authority of Z and Ibn-Maaroof.]<br>\
4<br>\
آتَاهُ, (S, M, &amp;c.,) inf. n. إِيتَآءٌ, (TA,) i. q.<br>\

above, (T, S,) He gave him (T, S, M, Msb, K) a<br>\
thing, (M, K,) or property: (Msb:) and you<br>\

thou]. (T.) We read in the Kur. [v. 60, &amp;c.] وَيُؤْتُونَ<br>\
الزَّكَاةَ[And they give the portion of property<br>\
which is the due of the poor]. (TA.) And in<br>\

meaning And she hath been given somewhat of<br>\
everything. (M, TA.) [You say also, أُوتِىَ كَذَا<br>\

thing, S, M) was, or became, prepared, disposed,<br>\
arranged, or put into a good or right state, for<br>\
him; (T, * S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) and hence, it<br>\
(a thing) was, or became, feasible or practicable,<br>\
and easy, to him; (Mgh;) it (an affair) was, or<br>\
became, facilitated, or easy, to him; (Msb;) the<br>\

[Fortune became well, or rightly, disposed for<br>\
him, so that he became restored to wealth, or competence]: (T:) or تَأَتَّى لَهُ الخَيْرُ الخ[good fortune,<br>\
or prosperity, became prepared, &amp;c., for him,<br>\

هٰذَا مِمَّا يَتَأَتَّى لِىَ المَضْغُThis is of the things which<br>\
it is feasible or practicable, and easy, to me to<br>\
chew. (Mgh). ―<br>\
