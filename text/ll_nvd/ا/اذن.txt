أَذِنَ لَهْ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and إِلَيْهِ, (M, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
اَذَنَ, (T, Msb, K,) inf. n. أَذَنٌ, (T, S, Msb, K,)<br>\
He [gave ear or] listened to it, (T, S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
or him: (T, S, M, K: *) or it signifies, (K,) or<br>\
signifies also, (M,) he listened to it, or him,<br>\
pleased, or being pleased. (M, K.) It is said in<br>\
a trad., (T,) مَا أَذِنَ اللّٰهِ لِشَىْءٍ لِنَبِىٍّ يَتَغَنَّى<br>\
بالقُرآنِ (T, S) God hath not listened to anything<br>\
[in a manner] like his listening [to a prophet<br>\
chanting the Kur-án]. (T.) And in the Kur<br>\
[lxxxiv. 2 and 5], وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّها And shall listen<br>\
to its Lord, (M, Bd, Jel,) and obey; (Jel;) i. e.,<br>\
shall submit to the influence of his power as one<br>\
listens to the commander and submits to him.<br>\
(Bd.) And you say, أَذِنَ لِلَّهْوِ He listened and<br>\
inclined to sport, or play. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,<br>\
perhaps,] أَذِنَ لِرَائِحَةِ الطَّعَامِ (assumed tropical:)  He desired eagerly,<br>\
or longed for, the food, [perceiving its odour,]<br>\
(ISh, K,) and inclined to it. (ISh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence also, app.,] أَذِنَ لَهُ فِى الشَّىء, (S, M, K,)<br>\
or فِى أَمْرِ كَذَا, (T,) or فِى كَذَا, (Msb,) aor.<br>\
اَذَنَ,<br>\
(T, K,) inf. n. إِذْنٌ, (T, S, M, K,) or this is a<br>\
simple subst., (Msb,) and أَذِينٌ, (K,) [as though<br>\
originally signifying He gave ear to him in<br>\
respect of such a thing; and then] he permitted<br>\
him, allowed him, or gave him permission or<br>\
leave, to do the thing, or such a thing. (M,<br>\
Msb, K.) [See also إِذْنٌ, below.] You say,<br>\
أَذِنْتُ لِلْعَبْدِ فَي التِّجَارَةِ [I gave permission, or<br>\
leave, to the slave to traffic]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  أَذِنَ<br>\
لَهُ عَلَيْهِ He took, or got, permission, or leave,<br>\
for him from him. (M.) You say, اِيذَنْ لِى<br>\
عَلَى الأَمِيرِ (S, TA) Take thou, or get thou,<br>\
permission for me from the commander, or<br>\
governor, or prince. (TA.) El-A&#39;azz Ibn-&#39;AbdAllah says,<br>\
وَ إِنِّى إِذَا ضَنَّ الأَمِيرُ بإِذْنِهِ<br>\
عَلَي الإِذنِ مِنْ نَفْسِى إِذا شِئْتٌ قَادِرٌ<br>\
[And verily I, when the prince is niggardly of<br>\
his permission, am able to take permission of<br>\
myself when I will]. (TA.) And a poet says,<br>\
قُلْتُ لِبَوَّابٍ لَدَيْهِ دَارُهَا<br>\
تِئْذَنْ فَإِنِّى حَيْؤُهَا وَجَارُهَا<br>\
[I said to a door-keeper, near by whom was<br>\
her house, take thou, or get thou, permission for<br>\
me to enter, for I am her husband&#39;s father, and<br>\
her neighbour]: meaning, says Aboo-Jaafar,<br>\
لِتَأْذَنْ; for the suppression of the ل is allowable<br>\
in poetry, and the pronunciation with kesr to the<br>\
ت is accord. to the dial. of him who says أَنْتَ<br>\
تِعْلَمُ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b5-  أَذِنَ بِالشَّىءِ, (S, * M, Msb, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
اَذَنَ, (S, M, K,) inf. n. إِذْنٌ and أَذَنٌ and أَذَانٌ<br>\
and أَذَانَةٌ, (M, K,) He knew the thing; knew<br>\
of it; had knowledge of it; became informed, or<br>\
apprized, of it. (S, M, Msb, K.) It is said in<br>\
the Kur [ii. 279], فَأْذَنُوا بِحَرْبٍ مِنَ اللّٰهِ وَرَسُولِهِ<br>\
(S, M, K) Then be ye informed, or apprized,<br>\
of war [that shall come upon you] from God<br>\
and his apostle: (M, K:) or then be ye sure,<br>\
or assured, &amp;c. (T.) [See also إِذْنٌ, below.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
أَذَنَهُ, (T, S, M, K,) inf. n. أَذْنٌ, (T,) He hit,<br>\
or hurt, his ear; (T, S, M, K;) or struck his<br>\
ear; (so in some copies of the S;) and ↓ آذَنَهُ<br>\
signifies the same, (M, K,) inf. n. إِيذَانٌ. (TA.)<br>\
[See also 2.] ―<br>\
-b2-  أُذِنَ [as though originally signifying He had his ear hit or hurt;] he complained,<br>\
or had a complaint, of his ear; (K;) said of<br>\
a man. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
أذّنهُ, (S, M, K,) inf. n. تَأْذِينٌ, (K,) He<br>\
wrung, or twisted, (عَرَكَ,) his (a boy&#39;s, S) ear:<br>\
(S, K:) or he struck, (ضَرَبَ, TA,) or struck with<br>\
his finger, or fillipped, (نَقَرَ, M, TA,) his ear.<br>\
(M, TA.) [See also أَذَنَهُ.] They say, (in a prov.,<br>\
TA in art. جوز,) لِكُلِّ جَابِهٍ جَوْزَةٌ ثُمَّ يُؤْذَّنُ, (M,<br>\
TA,) i. e. For every one that comes to water is a<br>\
single watering for his family and his cattle;<br>\
then his ear is struck, to apprize him that he<br>\
has nothing more to receive from them: (TA<br>\
in the present art., and the like is said in the<br>\
same in art. جوز:) or, (assumed tropical:)  then he is repelled from<br>\
the water: (TA in art. جوز:) [for أذّنهُ signifies<br>\
also] ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  He repelled him, (IAar, T, M, K,)<br>\
namely, a man, (IAar, T, M,) from drinking,<br>\
(K,) and did not give him to drink. (M, K.)<br>\
You say also, أَذِّنُوا عَنِّى أُوَلَهَا, [in which the<br>\
pronoun appears, from the context, to relate to<br>\
camels,] (assumed tropical:)  Send ye away from me the first ones<br>\
of them. (En-Nadr, T.)<br>\
-A2-  أذّن النَّعْلَ, (inf. n.<br>\
as above, S,) He put to the sandal what is termed<br>\
أُذُنٌ, q. v. infrà: (S, M, K:) and in like manner<br>\
one says with respect to other things. (S, K.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
أذّن, (M, K,) inf. n. as above, (K,) also signifies He made known, or notified, a thing (بِشَىْءٍ)<br>\
much; (M, K; *) he proclaimed, or made proclamation; syn. نَادَى: (Jel in vii. 42, and<br>\
Bd and Jel in xii. 70 and xxii. 28:) Sb<br>\
says that some of the Arabs make أَذَّنَ and<br>\
↓ آذَنَ to be syn.: but some say that the former<br>\
signifies he called out publickly; and the latter,<br>\
i. q. أَعْلَمَ [he made to know, &amp;c.: see 4]. (M,<br>\
TA.) It is said in the Kur [xxii. 28], وَأَذِّنْ فِى<br>\
النَّاسِ بِالحَجِّ (M) And proclaim thou, among the<br>\
people, the pilgrimage. (Bd, Jel.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S,<br>\
K,) or أذّن بِالصَّلَاةِ, (Msb,) inf. n. as above, (M,<br>\
K,) or أَذَانٌ, (S,) or both, (TA,) or the latter<br>\
is [properly speaking] a simple subst. [used as<br>\
an inf. n.], as in the instances of وَدَّعَ وَدَاعَّا and<br>\
سَلَّمَ سَلَامًا and كَلَّمَ كَلَامًا &amp;c., (Msb,) He<br>\
called to prayer; (M, K;) he notified, or made<br>\
known, or proclaimed, [i. e., chanted, from the<br>\
مِئْذَنَة,] the time of prayer; (S, * Msb, * TA;)<br>\
and ↓ آذَنَ signifies the same, (K,) inf. n. إِيذَانٌ.<br>\
(TA.) IB says, the phrase أَذَّنَ العَصْرُ, with the<br>\
verb in the act. form, [a phrase commonly obtaining in the present day,] is wrong; the correct<br>\
expression being أُذِّنَ بِالعَصْرِ [The time of the<br>\
prayer of afternoon was proclaimed, i. e., chanted],<br>\
with the verb in the pass. form, and with the<br>\
preposition to connect it with its subject. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  You say also, أَذَّنَ بِإِرْسَالِ إِبِلِهِ He spoke of<br>\
sending away his camels. (En-Nadr, T.)<br>\
4<br>\
آذنهُ: see 1, last sentence but one. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,<br>\
app.,] inf. n. إِيذَانٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He prevented him, or forbade him; (K;) and repelled him. (TA.) [See<br>\
also 2.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  It (a thing, M) pleased, or<br>\
rejoiced, him, (M, K,) and he therefore listened<br>\
to it. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  آذَنْتُهُ, inf. n. إِيذَانٌ, (T, Msb,) in<br>\
the place of which the subst. أَذَانٌ is also used,<br>\
(T,) signifies أَعْلَمْتُهُ [I made him to know, or<br>\
have knowledge; informed, apprized, advertised,<br>\
or advised, him; gave him information, intelligence, notice, or advice: and I made it known,<br>\
notified it, or announced it]: (T, Msb:) and<br>\
↓ تَأَذَّنْتُ, also, signifies أَعْلَمْتُ [as meaning I made<br>\
to know, &amp;c.: and I made known, &amp;c.]. (Msb.)<br>\
You say, آذنهُ بِالأَمْرِ, (T, K, [in the CK, erroneously, اَذَنَهُ,]) or بِالشَّىْءِ, (S,) and آذنهُ الأَمْرَ, (M,<br>\
K,) inf. n. إِيذَانٌ, (T,) meaning أَعْلَمَهُ [He made<br>\
him to know, or have knowledge of, the thing;<br>\
informed, apprized, advertised, or advised, him of<br>\
it; gave him information, intelligence, notice, or<br>\
advice, of it; made it known, notified it, or<br>\
announced it, to him]; (T, S, M, K;) as also<br>\
الأَمْرَ ↓ تأذّنهُ. (M.) So, accord. to one reading,<br>\
in the Kur [ii. 279], فَآذِنُوا بِحَرْبٍ مِنَ اللّٰهِ Then<br>\
make ye known, or notify ye, or announce ye, war<br>\
from God. (M. [For the more common reading,<br>\
see 1, latter part.]) And so in the Kur [vii. 166],<br>\
رَبُّكَ ↓ وَ إِذْ تَأَذَّنَ And when thy Lord made known,<br>\
or notified, or announced: (Zj, S, M, K: *) or<br>\
the meaning here is, swore: (M, K: *) [for] you<br>\
say, لَيَفْعَدَنَ ↓ تَأَذَّنَ, meaning he swore that he<br>\
would assuredly do [such a thing]: (M:) Lth<br>\
says that لَأَ فْعَلَنَّ كَذَا وَ كَذَا ↓ تَأَذَّنْتُ signifies the<br>\
making the action obligatory. (T.) You say also,<br>\
الأَمِيرُ فِى النَّاسِ ↓ تَأَذَّنَ The commander, or governor, or prince, proclaimed (نَادَى) among the<br>\
people, with threatening (S, K) and prohibition;<br>\
i. e. تَقَدَّمَ and أَعْلَمَ. (S.) And you say of a<br>\
building that has cracked in its sides, آذَنَ بِالِانْهِدَامِ<br>\
وَالسُّقُوطِ (assumed tropical:)  [It gave notice of becoming a ruin<br>\
and of falling down]. (Msb in art. دعو.) [See<br>\
also a similar ex. in a verse cited voce أَلَا. And<br>\
hence,] آذَنَ العُشْبُ [in the CK (erroneously) اَذَنَ]<br>\
(tropical:)  The herbage began to dry up; part of it being<br>\
still succulent, and part already dried up. (M,<br>\
K, TA.) And آذَنَ الحُبُّ The grain put forth<br>\
its أَذَنَة, or leaves. (TA.) See also 2, latter half,<br>\
in two places.<br>\
-A3-  آذَنَ and ↓ تأذّن are [also] used<br>\
in one and the same sense [as meaning He knew;<br>\
had knowledge; or became informed, apprized,<br>\
advertised, or advised, of a thing]; like as one<br>\
says أَيْقَنَ and تَيَقَّنَ. (S, TA.) You say, ↓ تَأَذَّنْ,<br>\
meaning اِعْلَمْ [Know thou]; like as you say<br>\
تَعَلَّمْ, meaning اِعْلَمْ. (M.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَاَذَّنَ see 4, in eight places.<br>\
10<br>\
استأذنهُ He asked, or demanded, of him<br>\
permission, or leave, (M, Msb, K,) فِى كَذَا to<br>\
do such a thing. (Msb.) [You say, استأذن meaning He asked, or demanded, permission, or leave,<br>\
to enter, or to come into the presence of another;<br>\
and to go. And استأذن فِى الدُّخُولِ عليه, and,<br>\
elliptically, استأذن عليه, He asked, or demanded,<br>\
permission, or leave, to go in to him.]<br>\
أُذْنٌ: see أُذُنٌ.<br>\
إِذْنٌ [is held by some to be an inf. n., like<br>\
↓ أَذَيِنٌ: (see 1:) by others, to be] a simple subst.;<br>\
(Msb;) signifying Permission; leave; or concession of liberty, to do a thing: and sometimes<br>\
command: and likewise will; (Msb, TA;) as in<br>\
the phrase بِإِذْنِ اللّٰهِ by the will of God: (Msb:)<br>\
or, accord. to El-Harállee, the withdrawal, or<br>\
removal, of prevention or prohibition, and the<br>\
giving of power or ability, in respect of being<br>\
and creation: or, accord. to Ibn-El-Kemál, the<br>\
rescission of prohibition, and concession of freedom of action, to him who has been prohibited by<br>\
law: or, accord. to Er-Rághib, the notification<br>\
of the allowance or permission of a thing, and of<br>\
indulgence in respect of it; as in إِلَّا لِيُطَاعَ بِإِذْنِ<br>\
اللّٰهِ, [in the Kur iv. 67,] meaning [but that he<br>\
may be obeyed] by the will of God, and [also]<br>\
by his command: (TA:) or, as explained in the<br>\
Ksh, facilitation; an explanation founded upon<br>\
the opinion that the actions of men are by their<br>\
own effective power, but facilitated by God; and<br>\
in this sense, Esh-Shiháb regards it as a metaphor,<br>\
or a non-metaphorical trope: (MF:) and accommodation; syn. تَوْفِيقٌ; (Hr in explanation of a<br>\
clause of iii. 139 of the Kur [which see below];)<br>\
but Es-Semeen says that this requires consideration. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Knowledge; syn. عِلْمٌ;<br>\
(T, M, K;) and so ↓ أَذِينٌ; (M, K;) as in the<br>\
saying فَعَلَهُ بِإِذْنِى (T, * M, K) and ↓ بِأَذِينى (M,<br>\
K) [He did it with my knowledge]: or إِذْنٌ has a<br>\
more particular signification than عِلْمٌ, being<br>\
scarcely ever, or never, used save of that [knowledge] wherein is will, conjoined with command or<br>\
not conjoined therewith; for in the saying [in the<br>\
Kur iii. 139, referred to above,] وَمَا كَانَ لِنَفْسٍ<br>\
أَنْ تَمُوتَ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِ اللّٰهِ [And it is not for a soul to<br>\
die save with the knowledge of God], it is known<br>\
that there are will and command; and in the<br>\
saying [in the Kur ii. 96], وَمَا هُمْ بِضَّارِينَ بِهِ مِنْ<br>\
أَحَدٍ إِلَّا بإِذْنِ اللّٰهِ [But they do not injure thereby<br>\
any one save with the knowledge of God], there is<br>\
will in one respect, for there is no difference of<br>\
opinion as to the fact that God hath made to exist<br>\
in man a faculty wherein is the power of injuring<br>\
another: (Er-Rághib:) but Es-Semeen says that<br>\
this plea is adduced by Er-Rághib because of his<br>\
inclining to the persuasion of the Moatezileh.<br>\
(TA.) You say also, فَعَلْتُ كَذَا بِإِذْنِهِ meaning<br>\
I did thus by his command. (T.)<br>\
أَذَنٌ: see أَذَنَةٌ<br>\
أُذُنٌ and ↓ أُذْنٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) the latter a<br>\
contraction of the former, [which is the more<br>\
common,] (Msb,) [The ear;] one of the organs<br>\
of sense; (M, TA;) well known: (M:) of the<br>\
fem. gender: (S, M, Msb, K:) as also ↓ أَذِينٌ:<br>\
(K:) pl. آذَانٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) its only pl. form:<br>\
(M:) dim. ↓ أُذَيْنَةٌ; but when used as a proper<br>\
name of a man, أُذَيْنُ, though أُذَيْنَةُ has been<br>\
heard. (S.) You say, جَآءَ نَاشِرَّا أُذُنَيْهِ [He came<br>\
spreading, or, as we say, pricking up, his ears:<br>\
meaning] (tropical:)  he came in a state of covetousness, or<br>\
eagerness. (T, K, TA. [See also نَشَرَ.]) And<br>\
وَجَدْتُ فُلَانًا لَا بِسًا أُذُنَيْهِ (tropical:)  I found such a one<br>\
feigning himself inattentive, or heedless. (T, TA.)<br>\
And لَبِسْتُ أُذُنَىَّ لَهُ (tropical:)  I turned away from him,<br>\
avoided him, or shunned him: or I feigned myself<br>\
inattentive, or heedless, to him. (K, TA. [See<br>\
also لَبِسَ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  A man who listens to what is said<br>\
to him: (M, K, TA:) or a man who hears the<br>\
speech of every one: (S:) or who relies upon<br>\
what is said to him; as also وَابِصَةُ السَّمْعِ: (M in<br>\
art. وبص:) applied as an epithet to one and to a<br>\
pl. number, (S, M, K,) alike, (S, M,) and to two,<br>\
and to a woman; not being pluralized nor dualized<br>\
[nor having the fem. form given to it]: (IB:)<br>\
you say رَجُلٌ أٌذْنٌ (AZ, S, M) and أُذْنٌ, and<br>\
رِجَالٌ أُذُنٌ and أُذْنٌ [&amp;c.]: (AZ, M:) and sometimes it is applied to a man as a name of evil<br>\
import. (M.) It is said in the Kur [ix. 61],<br>\
وَيَقُولُونَ هُوَ أُذُنٌ قُلْ أُذُنُ خَيْرٍ لَكُمْ (T, M) And<br>\
they say, “He is one who hears and believes<br>\
everything that is said to him:” as though, by<br>\
reason of the excess of his listening, he were<br>\
altogether the organ of hearing; like as a spy is<br>\
termed عَيْنٌ; or أُذُن is here from أَذِنَ “he listened,” and is like أُنُفٌ and شُلُلٌ in its derivation:<br>\
(Bd:) for among the hypocrites was he who<br>\
found fault with the Prophet, saying, “If anything be told him from me, I swear to him, and<br>\
he receives it from me, because he is an أُذُن:” (M:)<br>\
therefore he is commanded to answer, Say, “A<br>\
hearer of good for you.” (T, M, Bd.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
sincere, or faithful, adviser of a people, who counsels to obedience: (Msb:) a man&#39;s intimate, and<br>\
special, or particular, friend. (TA.) ―<br>\

(K:) and (tropical:)  of a نَصْل [or arrow-head or the like;<br>\
i. e. either wing thereof]: and (tropical:)  of an arrow;<br>\
آذَانُ السَّهْمِ signifying the feathers of the arrow,<br>\
as AHn says, when they are attached thereon;<br>\
and ذُو ثَلَاثِ آذَانٍ [a thing having three such<br>\
feathers] meaning an arrow: all so called by<br>\
way of comparison: (M:) and (assumed tropical:)  of a sandal; (S,<br>\
M, K;) i. e. the part thereof that surrounds the<br>\
قِبَال [q. v.]: (M:) or أُذُنَا النَّعْلِ signifies the two<br>\
parts, [or loops,] of the sandal, to which are tied<br>\
the عَضُدَانِ of the شِرَاك, [or two branches of the<br>\
thong that is attached to another thong between<br>\
two of the toes, which two branches, however,<br>\
sometimes pass through the أُذُنَانِ, encompassing<br>\
the heel,] behind the narrow part (خَصْر) of the<br>\
sole. (AO in an anonymous MS in my possession.<br>\
See also خَصْرٌ.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (tropical:)  A handle, (M,) or [a loopshaped, or an ear-shaped, handle, such as is<br>\
termed] عُرْوَة, (T, K,) of anything; (M, K) as,<br>\
for instance, (M,) of a كُوز [or mug]; (T, M;) and of a<br>\
دَلْو [or bucket]: so called by way of comparison:<br>\
and in all cases fem.: (M:) pl. as above. (T.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  (assumed tropical:)  What becomes sharp, or pointed, and then<br>\
falls off, or out, of the plants called عَرْفَج and<br>\
ثُمَام when they put forth their خُوص [q. v.],<br>\
or when their خوص become perfect; because it<br>\
has the shape of an ear. (AHn, M.)<br>\
إِذَنْ, also written إِذًا: see art. اذا.<br>\
أَذَنَةٌ The leaves of trees, (En-Nadr, T,) or of<br>\
grain. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [The kind of leaf called خُوصَة<br>\
of the ثُمَام.] ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  The young ones of camels and<br>\
of sheep or goats; (En-Nadr, T, K;) as being<br>\
likened to the خُوصَة of the ثُمَام. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  A<br>\
piece of straw: pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] ↓ أَذَنٌ<br>\
[in the CK أُذُنٌ]. (IAar, T, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Appetite,<br>\
appetency, longing, yearning, or strong desire.<br>\
(En-Nadr, T.) You say, هٰذِهِ بَقْلَةٌ تَجِدُ بِهَا الإِبِلُ<br>\
أَذَنَةَ شَدِيدَةً This is a herb for which the camels<br>\
feel a strong appetite &amp;c. (En-Nadr, T.) And<br>\
هٰذَا طَعَامٌ لَا أَذَنَةَ لَهُ This is food for the odour of<br>\
which there is no appetite. (K, * TA.)<br>\
أَذَانٌ A making known; a notification; an<br>\
announcement. (T, S, Mgh.) [See 4.] So in<br>\
the Kur [ix. 3], وَ أَذَانٌ مِنَ اللّٰهِ وَرَسُولِهِ إِلَى النَّاسِ<br>\
[And a notification, or an announcement, from<br>\
God and his apostle to men, or the people]. (T,<br>\
Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, and ↓ أَذِينٌ, (T, S, M, K,) and<br>\
تَأْذِينٌ, [the last an inf. n. of 2, and the second<br>\
a quasi-inf. n. of the same, which see,] (M, K,)<br>\
The notification, or announcement, of prayer, and<br>\
of the time thereof; (T, S;) the call to prayer.<br>\
(M, K.) [The words of this call (which is<br>\
usually chanted from the مِئْذَنَة, or turret of the<br>\
mosque,) are اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرْ (four times) أَشْهَدُ أنْ لَا إِلٰهَ<br>\
إِلَّا اللّٰهْ (twice) أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَّسُولُ اللّٰهُ (twice)<br>\

اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرٌ (twice) لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  الأَذَانُ also<br>\
