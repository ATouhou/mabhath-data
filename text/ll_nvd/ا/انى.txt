أَنَى, (S, M, K,) aor. يَأْنِى, (S,) inf. n. إِنٌى<br>\
(S, M, K) and أَنْىٌ and أَنَآءٌ, (M, K,) or, accord.<br>\
to [some of the copies of] the M, أَنًى, (TA, [in<br>\
which this is said to be the right form,]) or أَنًا,<br>\
(as written in the CK,) said of a thing, Its time<br>\
came; or it was, or became, or drew, near;<br>\
syn. أَتَى وَقْتُهُ, and جَآءَ أَنَاهُ; (Bd lvii. 15 [in<br>\
explanation of a passage cited voce أَنْ];) or حَانَ:<br>\
(S, M, K:) or أَنَى, aor. يَأْنِى, inf. n. أَنْىٌ, signifies it was, or became, or drew, near; and it was,<br>\
or became, present. (Msb.) You say, أَنَى لَكَ<br>\
أَنْ تَفْعَلَ, aor. يَأْنِى; and آنَ, aor. يَئِينُ; and<br>\
نَالَ لك, aor. يَنِيلُ; and أَنَالَ; all meaning<br>\
حَانَ لَكَ [The time has come, or has drawn near,<br>\
for thee that thou shouldst do such a thing: or<br>\
the time of thy doing such a thing has come to<br>\
thee: or thy doing such a thing has drawn near]:<br>\
so says Zj; and Fr says the like: but the best<br>\
of these is أَنَى لَكَ. (T.) And أَنَى الرَّحِيلُ The<br>\
time of departure came, or drew near; syn. حَانَ<br>\
وَقْتُهُ. (TA, from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It came, or attained,<br>\
to its time; to its full, or final, time or state;<br>\
to maturity, or ripeness; it became mature, or<br>\
ripe; (T, S, M, IAmb, * Msb, * K;) or, accord.<br>\
to some, only when said of a plant; (M, K;) [or<br>\
it signifies also] it became thoroughly cooked.<br>\
(T, Msb. *) Hence, in the Kur [xxxiii. 53],<br>\
غَيْرَنَاظِرِينَ إِنَاهُ Not waiting, or watching, for<br>\
its becoming thoroughly cooked; or for its cooking becoming finished. (T, S, * M.) [See also إِنًى,<br>\
below.] You say also, أَنَى الحَمِيمُ, (inf. n. أَنْىٌ,<br>\
TA,) The hot water became heated to the utmost<br>\
degree. (S, K.) And أَنَى المَآءُ The water became<br>\
hot to the utmost degree. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  أَنَى, aor. أُنِىٌّ,<br>\
inf. n. أَنْىٌ, It (a thing) was, or became, behind,<br>\
or after, its time: (Lth, T:) or أَنَى, inf. n. أُنِىٌّ,<br>\

backward, or late; it, or he, delayed, or held<br>\
back; (M, K;) as also أَنِىَ, aor. يَأْنَى, inf. n.<br>\
إِنًى; and ↓ أَنَّى, inf. n. تَأْنِيَةٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5,<br>\
in two places.<br>\
2<br>\
اَنَّىَ see 4, in two places:<br>\
-A2-  and see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  You<br>\
say also, أَنَّيْتُ فِى الشَّىْءِ I fell short, or fell short<br>\
of what was requisite or what I ought to have<br>\
done, or flagged, or was remiss, in, or in respect<br>\
of, the thing. (TA. [The verb is there written<br>\
without any syll. signs; but the context seems<br>\
to indicate that it is as above.])<br>\
4<br>\
آنى and ↓ أنّى signify the same. (IAar, T,<br>\
M.) You say, آنَاهُ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) with<br>\
medd, (Msb,) aor. يُؤْنِيهِ, (S,) inf. n. إِينَآءٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
[in the CK, اَنَيْتُهُ اِنْيًا is erroneously put for آنَيْتُهُ<br>\
إِينَآءٌ,] He postponed it, put it off, deferred it, delayed it, retarded it; (T, S, M, Msb, K;) retrained<br>\
it, withheld it, impeded it; (S, TA;) whatever<br>\
the thing be. (T.) And الطَّعَامَ فِى النَّارِ ↓ أَنَّيْتُ I<br>\
kept the food long upon the fire. (TA.) And<br>\
لَا تُؤْنِ فُرْصَتَكَ Postpone not thou, or defer not,<br>\
thine opportunity, or the time when thou art able<br>\
to do a thing. (T.) And it is said in a trad.,<br>\
respecting the prayer of Friday, رَأَيْتُكَ آنَيْتَ وَآذَيْتَ<br>\
(M, * Mgh, * TA) I see thee to have delayed<br>\
coming, and to have done what is annoying to<br>\
others by stepping over the necks [of those already<br>\
in their places in the mosque]: (As, Mgh, * TA:)<br>\
a saying of &#39;Omar. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  آنَاهُ also signifies<br>\
He made him, or it, to be distant, remote, or far<br>\
off; removed far away, alienated, or estranged,<br>\
him, or it; like أَنْآهُ [from which it is formed by<br>\
transposition]. (TA.) [Hence,] يُؤْنِيكَ occurs in a<br>\
verse of Es-Sulameeyeh; (M, TA;) meaning<br>\
يُنْئِيكَ; the ء being put before the ن (M.)<br>\
5<br>\
تأنّى He acted deliberately, or leisurely,<br>\
not hastily; as also ↓ استأنى; and ↓ أَنِىَ, (M, K,)<br>\
aor. يَأْنَى, (K,) inf. n. أنْىٌ: (TA:) he acted with<br>\
moderation, gently, deliberately, or leisurely;<br>\
without haste; and with gravity, staidness, sedateness, or calmness; فِى الأَمْرِ in the affair;<br>\
as also ↓ استأنى: (Mgh:) or he acted gently;<br>\
(IAar, T, TA;) as also ↓ أَنِىَ, aor. and inf. n. as<br>\
above: (TA:) or he acted gently, and waited;<br>\
فِى الأَمْرِ in the affair: (S:) or he waited, or<br>\
was patient, or waited with patience, (T, Msb,)<br>\
and did not hasten, in an affair. (Msb.) التَّأَتِّى<br>\
and التَّأَنِّى are nearly syn.: you say, تأنّى لَهُ He<br>\
acted gently with him, [or to him,] and did not<br>\
hasten in his affair. (Mgh.) You say also,<br>\
بِهِ ↓ استأنى He waited patiently with him; or<br>\
waited, and had patience, with him; (S, TA;)<br>\
he did not hasten him; (Lth, T;) as also ↓ استأناهُ.<br>\
(&#39;Eyn, Har p. 67.) And بِهِ حَوْلًا ↓ اُسْتُؤْنِىَ [He<br>\
was waited patiently with for a year]. (S.) And<br>\
فِى أَمْرِكَ ↓ اِسْتَأْنِ Hasten not in thine affair.<br>\
(Lth, T.) And فِى الطَّعَامِ ↓ اِسْتَأْنَيْتُ I waited<br>\
for the food to become perfectly prepared or<br>\
cooked. (Har p. 67.) And تَأَنَّيْتُ الرَّجُلَ (and<br>\
عَلَيْهِ, M and K in art. نظر, [see اِنْتَظَرَهُ,]) I<br>\
waited for the man; as also بِهِ ↓ اِسْتَأْنَيْتُ: whence,<br>\
بِالْجِرَاحَاتِ ↓ يُسْتَأنَى One should wait for the issues,<br>\
or consequences, or results, of wounds. (Mgh.)<br>\
And تَأنَّيْتُكَ حَتَّى لَا أَنَاةَ بِى [I have waited<br>\
patiently for thee until there is no disposition<br>\
to wait patiently in me]. (S.)<br>\

أَنْىٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
إِنْىٌ (AO, T, S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ إِنًى, (Akh,<br>\
T, S, Msb,) the latter in [some of] the copies of<br>\
the K erroneously written أَنَآءٌ, (TA,) [and in<br>\
other copies of the same omitted,] and ↓ إِنْوٌ,<br>\
(Akh, Th, T, S, M, K,) with و substituted for ى,<br>\
(AAF, M,) and ↓ أَنْىٌ (K) and ↓ أَنًى, (M,<br>\
I Amb,) An hour, or a short portion, or a time,<br>\
or an indefinite time, (سَاعَةٌ,) of the night: (Zj,<br>\
T, S, M, K:) or a time or season (وَقْتٌ) of the<br>\
night: (M in art. انو:) or i. q. وَهْنٌ [the period<br>\
about midnight; or the time after an hour, or a<br>\
short period, of the night; or when the night is<br>\
departing]: (M, K:) or any سَاعَة [i. e. hour, or<br>\
short portion, or time,] (M, K) of the night:<br>\
(M:) [and any period of time; as will be seen<br>\
below:] or, accord. to some, (M,) ↓ إِنًى signifies<br>\
the whole day; (M, K;) as also ↓ أَنًى: (K:)<br>\
the pl. is آنَآءٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and أُنىٌّ and<br>\
إِنِىٌّ. (M, K.) You say, مَضَى إِنْىٌ مِنَ الَّيْلِ and<br>\
↓ إِنْوٌ [&amp;c.] A time, or season, [&amp;c.,] (وَقْتٌ,<br>\
[&amp;c.,]) of the night passed: (M in art. انو:)<br>\
dual إِنْيَانِ and إِنْوَانِ. (S.) And a poet says,<br>\
أَتَمَّتْ حَمْلَهَا فِى بَعْضِ شَهْرٍ<br>\
وَحَمْلُ الحَامَلَاتِ إنًى طَوِيلُ<br>\
[She completed her gestation in a portion of a<br>\
month; but the gestation of the pregnant in<br>\
general is a long period of time]. (IAar, T.)<br>\
Another uses the phrase ضَحَّاكُ الأُنِىْ, occurring<br>\
at the end of a verse, [for ضحّاك الأُنِىِّ,] meaning<br>\
Found to be laughing whenever one comes to him.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
أَنًى: see إِنْىٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  The utmost<br>\
point, reach, or degree, (M, K,) of a thing; (M;)<br>\
as also ↓ إِنًى: so in the phrase, بَلَغَ أَنَاهُ and إِنَاهُ<br>\
It (a thing, M) attained its utmost point, reach,<br>\
or degree: (M, K:) or this means, [or, accord.<br>\
to the CK, “and” it means,] its state of being<br>\
thoroughly cooked; its state of maturity; or its<br>\
full, or final, time or state. (K.) [See 1, where<br>\
an ex. from the Kur xxxiii. 53 is cited. Both<br>\
words are said to be inf. ns.]<br>\
-A2-  See also أَنَاةٌ.<br>\
إِنًى: see إِنِىٌ, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see أَنًى.<br>\
أَنَآءٌ [Postponement; a putting off; a deferring;<br>\
a delaying; a retarding: restraint; a withholding; an impeding:] a subst. from آنَاهُ, aor. يُؤْنِيهِ,<br>\
inf. n. إِينَآءٌ, meaning “he postponed it,” &amp;c.: (S,<br>\
Msb, * TA:) the context of the K erroneously<br>\
requires it to be understood as a subst. from أَنَى,<br>\
aor. يَأْنى. (TA.)<br>\
إِنَآءٌ A certain thing of which one makes use,<br>\
(M,) well known; (S, K;) namely, a vessel, or<br>\
receptacle, (Mgh, Msb,) for water [&amp;c.]: (Mgh:)<br>\
pl. آنِيَةٌ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) originally أَأْنِيَةٌ;<br>\
(M;) and أَوَانٍ; (T, S, M, Mgh, K;) the former<br>\
a pl. of pauc.; and the latter a pl. of mult., (Mgh,)<br>\
pl. of آنِيَةٌ. (T, S, M.)<br>\
أَنَاةٌ Moderation; gentleness; deliberateness; a<br>\
leisurely manner of proceeding, or of deportment,<br>\
&amp;c.; patience, as meaning contr. of hastiness:<br>\
and gravity; staidness; sedateness; calmness: a<br>\
subst. from تَأَنَّى; (S, Msb;) syn. تُؤَدَةٌ; (T;) and<br>\
رِفْقٌ; (Ham p. 317;) and حِلْمٌ and وَقَارٌ; (M, Mgh,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ أنًى. (M, K, TA. [In the CK,<br>\
كالاَنْىِ is erroneously put for كَالأَنَى.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
Hope: [in this sense, accord. to the TA, written<br>\
with kesr; but this is doubtless a mistake, probably occasioned by a mistranscription:] so in<br>\
the charge of &#39;Orweh to his sons; يَا بَنِىَّ إِذَا رَأَيْتُمْ<br>\
خَلَّةً رَائِعَةً مِنْ رَجُلٍ فَلَا تَقْطَعُوا أَنَاتَكُمْ مِتْهُ وَإِنْ<br>\
كَانَ عِنْدَ النَّاسِ رَجُلَ سَؤْءٍ [O my sons, when ye see<br>\
a quality exciting admiration and approval, in a<br>\
man, cut not ye off your hope of him, though he<br>\
be in the estimation of the people a bad man].<br>\
(M.)<br>\
-A2-  A woman in whom is a languor on the<br>\
occasion of rising, or standing up; (T, S, K;)<br>\
and a gentle, or grave, deportment: (S:) or in<br>\
whom is a languor impeding from rising, or<br>\
standing up: (As:) and وَهْنَانَةٌ signifies the like:<br>\
(T:) Sb says that it is originally وَنَاةٌ, like as أَحَدٌ<br>\
is originally وَحَدٌ; from الوَنَى: (S:) the people<br>\
of El-Koofeh say that it is only وَنَاةٌ: so says Lth:<br>\
and he says that أَنَاةٌ signifies, as applied to a<br>\
woman, blessed, prospered, or abounding in good,<br>\
as it is explained also by ADk, and forbearing,<br>\
gentle, grave, staid, sedate, or calm, and compliant,<br>\
or agreeing with another in mind or opinion: and<br>\
the pl. is أَنَواتٌ: or, as some say, it signifies a<br>\
grave, staid, sedate, or calm, woman, who does<br>\
not clamour, nor utter foul language. (T.)<br>\
أَنِىٌّ, as part. n. of 1, A thing of which the time<br>\
has come, or drawn near: and which has come,<br>\
or attained, to its time; to its full, or final, time<br>\
or state; to maturity, or ripeness: but accord.<br>\
to some, only applied to a plant. (M, K.) [Compare آنٍ.]<br>\
-A2-  Behind, or after, the time; backward, or late; delayed, or held back; (K, TA;<br>\
[but wanting in a MS. copy of the former in my<br>\
possession, and in the CK;]) as also ↓ آنٍ. (TA.)<br>\
إٍنِيهْ a word expressive of disapproval, and of<br>\
deeming a thing remote or improbable: Sb relates<br>\
that it was said to an Arab of the desert, who had<br>\
taken up his abode in a town, or place, “Wilt<br>\
thou go forth when the desert shall have become<br>\
plentiful in herbage?” and he said, أَأَنَا إِنِيهْ [What,<br>\
I, indeed?], meaning “Do ye say this to me when<br>\
I am know to do thus?” as though he disapproved of their questioning him: but there is<br>\
much diversity of opinion respecting this word:<br>\
(TA:) [accord. to some,] it is composed of the<br>\
redundant إِنْ and the meddeh denoting disapproval [followed by the ه of silence]. (Mughnee<br>\
voce إِنٌ.) [See what is said of the redundant انْ<br>\
in the present work.]<br>\
أَنَّى signifies Whence? syn. مِنْ أَيْنَ; (T, S,<br>\
M;) being an interrogative respecting the direction, or quarter, from which a thing is: (Msb:)<br>\
and whence [used to denote a condition]: (TA:)<br>\
and where? and where [used to denote a condition]; syn. أَيْنَ: (T, K: [in which latter the first<br>\
signification is not mentioned:]) and as one of<br>\
the adverbial nouns used to denote a condition,<br>\
whencesoever; from whatever direction or quarter:<br>\
(S:) and wherever; wheresoever: (Lth, T:) and<br>\
when? and when [used to den a condition];<br>\
syn. مَتَى: (T, K: [but in the latter of these, in<br>\
art. ان, in the place of مَتَى we find حَيْثُ, which<br>\
I regard as a mistake:]) and how? syn. كَيْفَ:<br>\
(Lth, T, S, M, K:) and however. (Lth, TA.) [I<br>\
mention all these significations together because<br>\
one of them is assigned by some authorities and<br>\
another by others to انّى in one and the same<br>\
instance.] You say, أَنَّى يَكُونُ هٰذَا Whence, from<br>\
what direction or quarter, from what way, will,<br>\
or should, be this? (Msb.) And أَنَّى لَكَ هٰذَا<br>\
Whence [came, or cometh,] to thee this? (S.) It<br>\
is said in the Kur [iii. 32], يَا مَرْيَمُ أَنَّى لَكِ هٰذَا<br>\
O Mary, whence [came] to thee this? (T.) And<br>\
in the same [xxxiv. 51], وَأَنَّى لَهُمُ التَّنَاوُشُ مِنْ<br>\
مَكَانٍ بَعِيدٍ, meaning [But] whence [shall the<br>\
attaining of belief be possible to them from a<br>\
distant place, i. e., (as explained in the S in art.<br>\
نوش,) in the world to come, when they have disbelieved in the present world? or but how &amp;c.?].<br>\
(T.) And in the same [1xxx. 25], accord. to one<br>\
reading, أَنَّى صَبَبْنَا المَآءَ صَبَّا, meaning Where have<br>\
we poured forth the water, pouring? but in this<br>\
is an allusion to the direction [whence the rain<br>\
comes]; and it may be rendered whence? &amp;c.; and<br>\
accord. to this reading, the pause upon طَعَامِهٌ<br>\
[immediately preceding] is complete. (IAmb,<br>\
T.) And you say, أَنَّى تَأْتِنِى آتِكَ, (S, K,) meaning<br>\
Whencesoever, or from whatever direction or<br>\
quarter, thou shalt come to me, I will come to<br>\
thee. (S.) In the saying of &#39;Alkameh,<br>\
وَمُطْعَمُ الغُنْمِ يُوْمَ الغُنْمِ مُطْعَمُهُ<br>\
أَنَّى تَوَجَّهَ وَالمَحْرُومُ مَحْرُومُ<br>\
the meaning is, [And he who is given spoil to<br>\
enjoy, (lit., who is fed therewith,) on the day of<br>\
spoil, is given it to enjoy] wherever he repairs, or<br>\
however he repairs, [and the prohibited is prohibited.] (Lth, T, TA.) The saying in the Kur<br>\
[iii. 159], قُلْتُمٌ أَنَّى هٰذَا means Ye say, When is<br>\
this? or How is this? (T,) or Whence is this?<br>\
(T, Bd, Jel.) And أَنَّى شئْتُمْ, in the same, [ii. 223,]<br>\
may mean Whence, or when, or how, ye will.<br>\
(TA.) You say also, أَنَّى لَكَ أَنْ تَفْتَحَ الحِصْنَ,<br>\
meaning How [is it, or will it be, possible for thee<br>\
to open, or conquer, the fortress]? (S.)<br>\
آنٍ Hot, or heated, to the utmost degree: applied<br>\
to hot water, (S, M, K,) in the Kur lv. 44: (S,<br>\
M:) fem. آنِيَةٌ; occurring in the Kur lxxxviii. 5.<br>\
M.)<br>\
-A2-  See also أَنِىٌّ.<br>\
-A3-  Also A man much characterized by moderation, gentleness, or deliberateness; by a leisurely manner of proceeding, or of<br>\
deportment, &amp;c.; by patience, as meaning contr.<br>\
of hastiness; by gravity, staidness, sedateness, or<br>\
calmness. (S, K. *)<br>\
أَتَيْتُهُ آنِيَةً بَعْدَ آنِيَةٍ is a phrase mentioned by<br>\
AAF, meaning I came to him time after time:<br>\
in which, [says ISd,] I am of opinion that آنية is<br>\
of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ from الإنَى: but the word<br>\
commonly known is آوِنَة [pl. of أَوَانٌ; or آيِنَة,<br>\
which is syn. with آوِنَة: see أَوَانٌ]. (M.)<br>\
