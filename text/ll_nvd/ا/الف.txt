أَلِفَهُ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
اَلَفَ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. إِلُفٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and أَلْفٌ (K) and<br>\
إِلَافٌ and وِلَافٌ, which is anomalous, and أَلَفَانٌ,<br>\
(M, TA,) He kept, or clave, to it; (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
T, M, Msb, * TA;) namely, a thing, (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
T, M, TA,) or a place; (S, Msb, TA;) as also<br>\
أَلَفَهُ, aor.<br>\
اَلِفَ; (TA;) and ↓ آلفهُ, (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S,<br>\
M, Msb,) aor. يُؤْلِفُ (S, TA,) inf. n. إِيلَافٌ; (S,<br>\
Msb, TA;) and ↓ آلفهُ, aor. يُؤَالِفُ, inf. n. مُؤَالَفَةٌ<br>\
and إِلَافٌ: (S, Msb, TA:) [he frequented it, or<br>\
resorted to it habitually; namely, a place:] he<br>\
became familiar with it; or accustomed, or habituated, to it; namely, a thing: (AZ, T:) he<br>\
became familiar, sociable, companionable, friendly,<br>\
or amicable, with him: (AZ, T, Msb:) he loved,<br>\
or affected, him; liked, approved, or took pleasure<br>\
in, him. (Msb.) You say, أَلِفَتِ الطَّيْرُ الحَرَمَ [The<br>\
birds kept to the sacred territory], and البُيُوتَ<br>\
[the houses]: and الظِّبَآءُ الرَّمْلِ ↓ آلَفَتِ The gazelles<br>\
kept to the sands. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  There are three manners of reading the passage in the Kur [evi. 1<br>\
and 2], CCC قُرَيْشٍ إِيلَافِهِمْ رِحْلَةَ الشِّتَآءِ وَ الصَّيْفِ ↓ لِإِيلَافِ;<br>\
the second and third being لِإِلَافِ and لِإِلْفِ; the<br>\
first and second of which have been adopted;<br>\
(Aboo-Is-hák, T, TA;) and the third also; this<br>\
being the reading of the Prophet [himself]: (TA:)<br>\
[accord. to all these readings, the passage may be<br>\
rendered, For the keeping of Kureysh, for their<br>\
keeping to the journey of the winter and of the<br>\
summer, or spring; the chapter going on to say,<br>\
for this reason &quot;let them worship the Lord of this<br>\
House,&quot; &amp;c. : or] the second and third readings<br>\
are from أَلِفَ, aor. يَأْلَفُ; [and accord. to these<br>\
readings, the passage may be rendered as above;]<br>\
but accord. to the first reading, the meaning is,<br>\
for the preparing and fitting out [&amp;c.; i. e.,<br>\
preparing and fitting out men and beasts in the<br>\
journey of the winter &amp;c.]: so says IAmb; and<br>\
Fr explains in the same manner the third reading:<br>\
but IAar says that, accord. to this reading, the<br>\
meaning is, the protecting [&amp;c.]: he says that<br>\
the persons who protected were four brothers,<br>\
Háshim and &#39;Abd-Shems and El-Muttalib and<br>\
Nowfal, the sons of &#39;Abd-Menáf: these gave protection to Kureysh in their procuring of corn:<br>\
(T:) Háshim obtained a grant of security from<br>\
the king of the Greeks, and Nowfal from Kisrà,<br>\
and &#39;Abd-Shems from the Nejáshee, and ElMuttalib from the kings of Himyer; and the<br>\
merchants of Kureysh used to go to and from the<br>\
great towns of these kings with the grants of<br>\
security of these brothers, and none opposed<br>\
them: Háshim used to give protection (يُؤْلِفُ [in<br>\
the copies of the K يُؤَلِّفُ]) [to those journeying]<br>\
to Syria, and &#39;Abd-Shems to Abyssinia, and ElMuttalib to El-Yemen, and Nowfal to Persia:<br>\
(T, K: *) or ↓ إِيلَاف in the Kur signifies a covenant,<br>\
or an obligation; and what resembles permission,<br>\
(إِجَازَة, as in some copies of the K and in the TA,)<br>\
or protection, (إِجَارَة, as in the CK,) with an<br>\
obligation involving responsibility for safety;<br>\
first obtained by Háshim, from the kings of<br>\
Syria; (K, * TA;) and the explanation is, that<br>\
Kureysh were dwelling in the sacred territory,<br>\
(K,) having neither seed-produce nor udders [to<br>\
yield them milk], (TA,) secure in the procuring<br>\
of their provisions from other parts, and in their<br>\
changes of place, in winter and summer, or spring;<br>\
the people around them having their property<br>\
seized; whereas, when any cause of mischief<br>\
occurred to them, they said, &quot;We are people of<br>\
the sacred territory,&quot; and then no one opposed<br>\
them: (K:) so in the O: (TA:) or the ل is to<br>\
denote wonder; and the meaning is, wonder ye<br>\
at the ايلاف of Kureysh [&amp;c.]: (K:) some say<br>\
that the meaning is connected with what follows;<br>\
i. e., let them worship the Lord of this House for<br>\
the ايلاف [&amp;c., agreeably with the first explanation which we have given]: others, that it is<br>\
connected with what precedes; as J says; (TA;)<br>\
the meaning being, I have destroyed the masters<br>\
of the elephant to make Kureysh remain at<br>\
Mekkeh, and for their uniting the journey of the<br>\
winter and of the summer, or spring; that when<br>\
they finished one, they should commence the<br>\
other; (T, S;) and this is like the saying,<br>\
ضَرَبْتُهُ لِكَذَا ضَرَبْتُهُ لِكَذَا لِكَذَا, with suppression of the [conjunctive] و: (S:) but Ibn-&#39;Arafeh disapproves<br>\
of this, for two reasons: first, because the phrase<br>\
&quot;In the name of God&quot; &amp;c. occurs between the<br>\
two chapters: [Bd, however, mentions that in<br>\
Ubeí&#39;s copy, the two compose one chapter:]<br>\
secondly, because ايلاف signifies the covenants,<br>\
or obligations, which they obtained when they<br>\
went forth on mercantile expeditions, and whereby<br>\
they became secure. (TA.) ↓ إِلَافٌ [in like manner]<br>\
signifies A writing of security, written by the<br>\
king for people, that they may be secure in his<br>\
territory: and is used by Musáwir Ibn-Hind in<br>\
the sense of اِيتِلَافٌ [as is also إِلْفٌ,] when he says,<br>\
in satirizing Benoo-Asad,<br>\
زَعَمْتُمْ أَنَّ إِخْوَتَكُمْ قُرَيْشٌ<br>\
لَهُمْ إِلْفٌ وَ لَيْسَ لَكُمْ إِلَافُ<br>\
meaning Ye asserted [that your brothers are<br>\
Kureysh; i. e.,] that ye are like Kureysh: but<br>\
how should ye be like them? for they have [an<br>\
alliance whereby they are protected in] the trade<br>\
of El-Yemen and Syria; and ye have not that<br>\
[alliance]. (Ham p. 636.) [Hence,] إِلَافُ اللّٰهِ<br>\
[a phrase used in the manner of an oath,] accord.<br>\
to some, signifies The safeguard, or protection, of<br>\
God: or, accord. to others, an honourable station<br>\
from God. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  أَلَفَهُ, aor.<br>\
اَلِفَ, He gave him<br>\
a thousand; (S, K) of articles of property, and<br>\
of camels. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
الّف بَيْنَهُمْ, inf. n. تَأْلِيفٌ, (T, Msb, K,) He<br>\
united them, or brought them together, (T, Msb,<br>\
TA,) after separation; (T, TA;) and made them<br>\
to love one another; (Msb;) he caused union, or<br>\
companionship, (أُلْفَة,) to take place between them.<br>\
(K.) And أَلَّفْتُ بَيْنَ الشَّيْئَيْنِ, inf. n. as above, [I<br>\
united, or put together, the two things.] (S.) And<br>\
ألّف الشَّىْءَ He united, or connected, (T,) or gathered or collected or brought together, (M,) the<br>\
several parts of the thing. (T, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
تَأْلِيفُ الكُتُبِ [The composition of books]. (T, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  تَأْلِيفٌ is The putting many things into such a<br>\
state that one name becomes applicable to them,<br>\
whether there be to some of the parts a relation to<br>\
others by precedence and sequence, or not: so that<br>\
it is a more general term than تَرْتِيبٌ: (KT:) or<br>\
the collecting together, or putting together, suitable<br>\
things; from الالفة [i. e. الأُلْفَةُ]; and is a more<br>\
particular term than تَرْكِيبٌ, which is the putting<br>\
together things, whether suitable or not, or placed<br>\
in order or not. (Kull p. 118.)<br>\
-A2-  أَلَّفُوا إِلَى كَذَا:<br>\
see 5.<br>\
-A3-  ألّف أَلِفًا He wrote an alif; (K;) like<br>\

with another to be protected during a journey for<br>\
the purpose of trade, or traffic: (see 1:) and<br>\
hence,] he (a man) traded, or trafficked. (M,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A3-  شَاَرَةٌ مُؤَالَفَةً He made a condition with<br>\
him for a thousand: (IAar, M:) like as one<br>\
says, شَارَطْتُهُ مُمَا آةً, meaning, for a hundred. (IAar,<br>\

كَذَا, (K,) inf. n. as above, (T,) He made him to<br>\

such a place. (T, S, * M, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  آلَفْتُ الشَّىْءَ I<br>\

-A3-<br>\
آلَفْتُ القَوْمَ, (T, * S, K, *) inf. n. as above, (S,) I<br>\
made the people, or company of men, to be a<br>\
thousand complete [by adding to them myself];<br>\
(T, S, K, TA;) they being before nine hundred<br>\
and ninety-nine. (T, TA.) And آلف العَدَدَ He<br>\
made the number to be a thousand; as also ↓ أَلَّفَهُ:<br>\
(M:) or الأَلْفَ ↓ ألّف he completed the thousand.<br>\
(K.) And in like manner, (S,) آلَفْتُ الدَّرَاهِمَ I<br>\
made the dirhems to be a thousand (S, K) complete. (S.) And لَهُمُ الأَعْمَارَ ↓ أَلَّفُو They said to<br>\

-A4-  آلَفُوا They became a thousand (T, S, M)<br>\

people, or party, became united, or came together,<br>\
(Msb, K,) [after separation, (see 2, of which<br>\

↓ ائْتِلَافٌ [and تَأَلُّفٌ also] is the being in a state of<br>\
union, alliance, agreement, congruity, or congregation: (Msb:) and the being familiar, sociable,<br>\

[meaning They became united, or put together;<br>\
(see 2;)] as also ↓ ائتلفا. (S.) And الشَّىْءُ ↓ ائتلف<br>\
signifies The several parts of the thing kept, or<br>\

a place, as is shown in the T by an explanation<br>\
of the words of IAar, كَانَ هَاشِمٌ يُؤْلِفُ إِلَى الشَّامِ,<br>\
in a passage in which the foregoing signification<br>\
is assigned to تألّفوا]; (M;) as also الى كذا ↓ أَلَّفُوا.<br>\

أَلْفٌ, meaning A certain number, (S, M, K,)<br>\
well known, (M,) i. e. a certain round number,<br>\
(Msb,) [namely a thousand,] is of the masc.<br>\
gender: (T, S, Msb, K:) you say ثَلَاثَةُ آلَافٍ<br>\
[Three thousand], not ثَلَاثَ آلَافٍ; (TA;) and<br>\
هٰذَا أَلْفٌ وَاحِدٌ [This is one thousand], not وَاحِدَةٌ;<br>\

accord. to ISK, it is allowable to say, هٰذِهِ أَلْفٌ as<br>\

آلَافٌ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) applied to a number<br>\
from three to ten, inclusively, (TA,) and أُلُوفٌ,<br>\

of them is masc. and fem., like as is لِسَانٌ. (M.)<br>\

applied to certain chief persons of the Arabs,<br>\
whom the Prophet was commanded to attract, or<br>\
allure, and to present with gifts, (T, K,) from the<br>\

(T, K,) and lest care for things which they deemed<br>\
sacred, or inviolable, together with the weakness<br>\
of their intentions, should induce them to combine<br>\
in hostility with the unbelievers against the Muslims; for which purpose, he gave them, on the<br>\
day of Honeyn, eighty [in the TA two hundred]<br>\
camels: (T:) they were certain men of eminence,<br>\
of the Arabs, to whom the Prophet used to give<br>\
gifts from the poor-rates; to some of them, to<br>\
prevent their acting injuriously; and to some,<br>\
from a desire of their becoming Muslims, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) and their followers also; (Msb;) and to<br>\
some, in order that they might remain stedfast as<br>\
Muslims, because of their having recently become<br>\
such; but when Aboo-Bekr became appointed to<br>\
the government, he forbade this practice. (Mgh,<br>\
