أَتْمٌ, (M, K,) in, or in relation to, a سِقَآء [or<br>\
skin for water or milk], (TA,) signifies The<br>\
having two punctures of a seam (خُزْرَتَانِ) rent so<br>\
as to become one. (M, K.) You say, أَتَمَتِ القِرْبَةٌ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
اَتِمَ, inf. n. أَتْمٌ, The water-skin had its two<br>\
punctures (خزرتاها [or rather two of its punctures,<br>\
agreeably with the explanation of the inf. n. in<br>\
the M and K, as given above,]) rent so that they<br>\
became one. (TK.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] The meeting<br>\
together of the مَسْلَكَانِ [or vagina and rectum]:<br>\
whence أَتُومٌ [q. v.] as an epithet applied to a<br>\
woman. (Ham p. 373.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [It seems to be indicated in the T, that one says, أَتِمَ النِسَآءُ, aor.<br>\
اَتَمَ,<br>\
and أَتَمَ, aor.<br>\
اَتِمَ; as meaning, or perhaps the former<br>\
only, The women assembled, or came together: for<br>\
I there find, immediately after مَأْتَمٌ as signifying<br>\
“a place in which women assemble,” “one says,<br>\
أَتِمَ, aor.<br>\
اَتَمَ, and أَتَمَ, aor.<br>\
اَتِمَ:” but it is then added<br>\
that, accord. to Khálid Ibn-Yezeed, مأتم is from<br>\
أَتِمَ, aor.<br>\
اَتَمَ.]<br>\
-A2-  I. q. فَتْقٌ [The act of rending,<br>\
rending asunder, ripping, or the like; or undoing<br>\
the sewing of a thing]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The act of<br>\
cutting. (Sgh, K.) You say, أَتَمَهُ He cut it.<br>\
(TK.)<br>\
-A3-  أَتَمَ, aor.<br>\
اَتِمَ, also signifies He brought<br>\
together, or united, two things. (T.) [See أَتُومٌ,<br>\
and مَأْتَمٌ.]<br>\
-A4-  أَتَمَ بِالمَكَانِ, (Sgh, Msb,) with two<br>\
forms of aor., [app.<br>\
اَتِمَ and<br>\
اَتُمَ,] (Msb,) inf. n. أَتْمٌ,<br>\
(Sgh, K,) or أُتُومٌ; (Msb;) and أَتِمَ, aor.<br>\
اَتَمَ;<br>\
(Msb;) He stayed, remained, dwelt, or abode, in<br>\
the place. (Sgh, Msb, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
اَتَّمَ see 4.<br>\
4<br>\
آتَمَهَا, inf. n. إِيتَآمٌ; and ↓ أَتَّمَهَا, inf. n. تَأْتِيمٌ;<br>\
He rendered her such as is termed أَتُوم, q. v.<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\
أَتُومٌ is primarily used in relation to the سِقآء<br>\
[or skin for water or milk; as meaning] Having<br>\
two punctures of a seam (خُرْزَتَانِ) rent so that<br>\
they become one. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (S,) or from<br>\
أَتَمَ as meaning “he brought together, or united,”<br>\
two things, (T,) A woman whose مَسْلَكَانِ [or<br>\
vagina and rectum] meet together in one, [by the<br>\
rupture of the part between them,] (T, M,) becoming conjoined, so that the فَرْج is enlarged<br>\
thereby, (TA,) on the occasion of devirgination;<br>\
(M;) i. q. مُفْضَاةٌ, (T, S, M,) as some say; (T;)<br>\
or مُفَاضَةٌ; (K; [said in the TA to be a mistake:<br>\
but مُفْضَاةٌ and مُفَاضَةٌ are said in the M, in art.<br>\
فيض, to have the same signification;]) a woman<br>\
whose مَسْلَكَانِ have become one: (Ham p. 271:)<br>\
or, as some say, small in the فَرْجَ [or vagina]:<br>\
(M:) or it has these two contr. significations.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
مَأْتَمٌ is a quasi-inf. n. of أَتَمَ in the last of the<br>\
senses explained above. (Msb.) [Thus it signifies<br>\
A staying, remaining, dwelling, or abiding, in<br>\
a place. But it more commonly signifies] The<br>\
assembling of women [and of men also] in a case<br>\
of rejoicing and of mourning. (Har p. 234.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
It is also a noun of time from the same. (Msb.)<br>\
[Thus it signifies A time of staying or remaining, &amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And it is also a noun of place from<br>\
the same. (Msb.) [And thus it signifies A place<br>\
of staying or remaining, &amp;c. But it more commonly signifies] A place of assembling of women<br>\
[and of men also] in a case of rejoicing and of<br>\
mourning: from أَتِمَ, aor.<br>\
اَتَمَ, accord. to Khálid<br>\
Ibn-Yezeed. (T.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And hence, tropically, (Msb,)<br>\
(tropical:)  Women assembling together (T, S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K) in a case of rejoicing and of mourning,<br>\
(T, M, Mgh, K,) or in a case of good and of evil:<br>\
(S, Msb:) or any assembly, (M, K,) of men and<br>\
of women, (M,) in a case of mourning or of rejoicing: (M, K:) or particularly of young women;<br>\
(M, K,) accord. to some; but it is not so: and<br>\
some assert that the word is derived from أَتْمٌ, in<br>\
the first of the senses explained in this art.; and<br>\
from أَتُومٌ, as an epithet applied to a woman;<br>\
because it signifies women coming together, and<br>\
meeting face to face, in a case of good and of evil:<br>\
(M:) the pl. is مَآتِمُ. (S, Mgh.) Abu-l-&#39;Atà<br>\
Es-Sindee says,<br>\
عَشِيَّةَ قَامَ النَّائِحَاتُ وَ شُقِّقَتْ<br>\
جُيُوبٌ بِأَيْدِى مَأْتَمٍ وَ خُدُودُ<br>\
[In the evening when arose the wailing women to<br>\
wail, and openings at the necks and bosoms of<br>\
garments were rent with the hands of assembled<br>\
mourning women, and cheeks also were lacerated]:<br>\
(S, M, Mgh:) i. e., بِأَيْدِى نِسَآءٍ. (S.) And<br>\
another says,<br>\
حَتَّى تَرَاهُنَّ لَدَيْهِ قُيَّمَا<br>\
كَمَا تَرَى حَوْلَ الأَمِيرِ المأْتَمَا<br>\
[So that thou seest them (referring to women)<br>\
standing in his presence, or at, or by, it, like as<br>\
thou seest the assembly of men around the prince,<br>\
or commander]: المأتم here necessarily denoting<br>\
men. (M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  IKt says, (Msb,) it is used by<br>\
the vulgar to denote An affliction, or evil accident; (S, Mgh, Msb;) [and Mtr adds,] and a<br>\
wailing: (Mgh:) they say, كُنَّا فِى مَإْتَمِ فَلَانٍ<br>\
[meaning We were present at the affliction of<br>\
such a one]: (S, Msb:) or كُنَّا فِى مَأْتَمِ بَنِي فُلَلنٍ<br>\
[meaning, We were present at the affliction, and<br>\
wailing, of the sons of such a one]: (Mgh:) but<br>\
the correct word in this case, (S, Mgh,) or the<br>\
better, (Msb,) is مَنَاحَة: (S, Mgh, Msb:) so says<br>\
IAmb. (Mgh.) But accord. to IB, nothing forbids that it may occur in the sense of A place<br>\
of wailing; and in the sense of mourning, and<br>\
wailing, and weeping; for therefore do women<br>\
assemble: and thus it may be in the saying of<br>\
Et-Teymee, respecting Mansoor Ibn-Ziyád,<br>\
وَ النَّاسُ مَأْتَمُهُمْ عَلَيْهِ وَاحِدٌ<br>\
فِى كلِّ دَارٍ رَنَّةٌ وَ زَفِيرُ<br>\
[The people&#39;s mourning, &amp;c., for him was one: in<br>\
every house was a moaning, and a sighting]: and<br>\
in the saying of another,<br>\
أَضْحَى بَنَاتُ السُّبِىِّ إِذْ قُتِلُوا<br>\
فِى مَأْتَمٍ وَالسِّبَاعُ فِى عُرُسِ<br>\
i. e. [The daughters of the captives, when they<br>\
were slain, became, in the early part of the day,]<br>\
in a state mourning; and the beasts of prey,<br>\
in a state of rejoicing. (TA.)<br>\
