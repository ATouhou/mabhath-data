أَلَهَ, (S, and so in some copies of the K,) with<br>\
fet-h, (S,) or أَلِهَ, (Mgh, Msb, and so in some<br>\
copies of the K,) like تَعِبَ, aor.<br>\
اَلَهَ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
إِلَاهَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and أُلُوهَةٌ and أُلُوهِيَّپٌ, (K,) He<br>\
served, worshipped, or adored; syn. عَبَدَ. (S,<br>\
Msb, K.) Hence the reading of I&#39;Ab, [in the<br>\
Kur vii. 124,] وَيَذَرَكَ وَإِلَاهَتَكَ [And leave thee,<br>\
and the service, or worship, or adoration, of thee;<br>\
instead of وَآلِهَتَكَ and thy gods, which is the common reading]; for he used to say that Pharaoh<br>\
was worshipped, and did not worship: (S:) so,<br>\
too, says, Th: and IB says that the opinion of<br>\
I&#39;Ab is strengthened by the sayings of Pharaoh<br>\
[mentioned in the Kur lxxix. 24 and xxviii. 38],<br>\
“I am your lord the most high,” and “I did not<br>\
know any god of yours beside me.” (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
أَلِهَ, aor.<br>\
اَلَهَ, (S, K,) inf. n. أَلَهٌ, (S,) He was, or<br>\
became, confounded, or perplexed, and unable to<br>\
see his right course; (S, K;) originally وَلِهَ. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  أَلِهَ عَلَي فُلَانٍ He was, or became, vehemently<br>\
impatient, or affected with vehement grief, or he<br>\
manifested vehement grief and agitation, on account of such a one; (S, K;) like وَلِهَ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
أَلِهَ إِلَيْهِ He betook himself to him by reason of<br>\
fright or fear, seeking protection; or sought, or<br>\
asked, aid, or succour, of him: he had recourse,<br>\
or betook himself, to him for refuge, protection,<br>\
or preservation. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  أَلِهَ بِالمَكَانِ He remained,<br>\
stayed, abode, or dwelt, in the place. (MF.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
أَلَهَهُ, (K,) like مَنَعَهُ, (TA,) [in the CK اَلِهَهُ,] He<br>\
protected him; granted him refuge; preserved,<br>\
saved, rescued, or liberated, him; aided, or succoured, him; or delivered him from evil: he<br>\
rendered him secure, or safe. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
تَأْلِيهٌ [inf. n. of أَلَّهَهُ He made him, or took<br>\
him as, a slave; he enslaved him;] i. q. تَعْبِيدٌ.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [The primary signification of أَلَّهَهُ seems<br>\
to be, He made him to serve, worship, or adore.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Accord. to Freytag, besides having the former<br>\
of the two meanings explained above, it signifies<br>\
He reckoned him among gods; held him to be a<br>\
god; made him a god: but he does not mention<br>\
his authority.]<br>\
5<br>\
تألّه He devoted himself to religious services<br>\
or exercises; applied himself to acts of devotion.<br>\
(JK, S, Msb, K.)<br>\
أُلْهَانِيَّةٌ: see إِلَاهَةٌ.<br>\
إِلهٌ, or إِلَاهٌ, [the former of which is the more<br>\
common mode of writing the word,] is of the<br>\
measure فعَالٌ (S, Msb, K) in the sense of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولٌ, (S, Msb,) like كِتَابٌ in the sense<br>\
of مَكْتُوبٌ, and بِسَاطٌ in the sense of مَبْسُوطً,<br>\
(Msb,) meaning ↓ مَأْلْوةٌ [An object of worship or<br>\
adoration; i. e. a god, a deity]; (S, Msb, K)<br>\
anything that is taken as an object of worship or<br>\
adoration, accord. to him who takes it as such:<br>\
(K:) with the article ال, properly, i. q. اللّٰهُ; [sec<br>\
this word below;] but applied by the believers in<br>\
a plurality of gods to what is worshipped by them<br>\
to the exclusion of اللّٰه: (Msb:) pl. آلِهَةٌ: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) which signifies idols: (JK, S, TA:) in<br>\
the K, this meaning is erroneously assigned to<br>\
إِلَاهَةٌ: (TA:) [not so in the CK; but there,<br>\
الالِهَةُ is put in a place where we should read<br>\
الإِلَاهَةُ, or إِلَاهَةُ without the article:] ↓ الإِلَاهَةُ [is<br>\
the fem. of الإِلَاهُ, and] signifies [the goddess: and<br>\
particularly] the serpent: [(a meaning erroneously<br>\
assigned in the CK to الآلِهَةُ; as also other meanings here following:) because it was a special<br>\
object of the worship of some of the ancient<br>\
Arabs:] (K:) or the great serpent: (Th:) and<br>\
the [new moon; or the moon when it is termed]<br>\
هِلَال: (Th, K:) and, (S, K,) as also ↓ إِلَاهَةُ,<br>\
without ال, the former perfectly decl., and the<br>\
latter imperfectly decl., (S,) and ↓ الأُلَاهَةُ, (IAar,<br>\
K,) and ↓ أُلَاهَةُ, (IAar, TA,) and ↓ الأَلَاهَةُ, (K,)<br>\
[and app. ↓ أَلَاهَةُ,] and ↓ الأَلِيهَةُ, (K,) the sun; (S,<br>\
K;) app. so called because of the honour and worship which they paid to it: (S:) or the hot sun. (Th,<br>\
TA.) [إِلهٌ is the same as the Hebrew<br>\
אֱלוֹהַּ and<br>\
The Chaldee<br>\
XXX; and is of uncertain derivaTion: accord. To some,] it is originally وِلَاهٌ, like<br>\
as إِشَاحٌ is originally وِشَاحٌ; meaning that mankind yearn towards him who is thus called,<br>\
[seeking protection or aid,] in their wants, and<br>\
humble themselves to him in their afflictions, like<br>\
as every infant yearns towards its mother. (TA.)<br>\

[<br>\
الإِلهِيَّةُ, or الإِلَاهِيَّةُ, Theology; the science of<br>\
the being and attributes of God, and of the<br>\
articles of religious belief; also termed عِلْمُ الإِلهِيَّاتِ<br>\
or الإِلَاهِيَّاتِ, and ↓ العِلْمُ الإِلهِىُّ or الإِلَاهِىُّ.]<br>\
اللّٰهُ, [written with the disjunctive alif اَللّٰهُ,<br>\
meaning God, i. e. the only true god,] accord. to<br>\
the most correct of the opinions respecting it,<br>\
which are twenty in number, (K,) or more than<br>\
thirty, (MF,) is a proper name, (Msb, K,) applied<br>\
to the Being who exists necessarily, by Himself,<br>\
comprising all the attributes of perfection; (TA;)<br>\
a proper name denoting the true god, comprising<br>\
all the excellent divine names; a unity comprising<br>\
all the essences of existing things; (Ibn-El-<br>\
&#39;Arabee, TA;) the ال being inseparable from it:<br>\
(Msb:) not derived: (Lth, Msb, K:) or it is<br>\
originally إِلهٌ, or إِلَاهٌ, (Sb, A Heyth, S, Msb, K,)<br>\
of the measure فِعَالٌ in the sense of the measure<br>\
مَفْعُولٌ, meaning مَأْلُوهٌ, (S, K, *) with [the article]<br>\
ال prefixed to it, (Sb, A Heyth, S, Msb,) so that<br>\
it becomes الإِلَاهُ, (Sb, A Heyth, Msb,) then the<br>\
vowel of the hemzeh is transferred to the ل [before<br>\
it], (Msb,) and the hemzeh is suppressed, (Sb,<br>\
A Heyth, S, Msb,) so that there remains اللّٰهُ, or<br>\
الِلَاهُ, after which the former ل is made quiescent,<br>\
and incorporated into the other: (Sb, A Heyth,<br>\
Msb:) the suppression of the hemzeh is for the<br>\
purpose of rendering the word easy of utterance,<br>\
on account of the frequency of its occurrence:<br>\
and the ال is not a substitute for the hemzeh; for<br>\
were it so, it would not occur therewith in الإِلَاهُ:<br>\
(S:) so says J; but IB says that this is not a<br>\
necessary inference, because الإِلَاهُ applies to God<br>\
(اللّٰهُ) and also to the idol that is worshipped;<br>\
whereas اللّٰهُ applies only to God; and therefore,<br>\
in using the vocative form of address, one may<br>\
say, يَا اَللّٰهُ [O God], with the article ال and with<br>\
the disjunctive hemzeh; but one may not say,<br>\
يَا الإِلَاهُ either with the disjunctive or with the<br>\
conjunctive hemzeh: (TA:) Sb allows that it<br>\
may be originally لَاهٌ: see art. ليه: (S:) some<br>\
say that it is from أَلِهَ, either because minds are<br>\
confounded, or perplexed, by the greatness, or<br>\
majesty, of God, or because He is the object of<br>\
recourse for protection, or aid, in every case: or<br>\
from أَلَهَهُ, meaning “he protected him,” &amp;c., as<br>\
explained above: see 1, last sentence. (TA.) The<br>\
ال is pronounced with the disjunctive hemzeh in<br>\
using the vocative form of address [يَا اَللّٰهُ] because<br>\
it is inseparably prefixed as an honourable distinction of this name; (S;) or because a pause<br>\
upon the vocative particle is intended in honour<br>\
of the name; (S in art. ليه;) and AAF says that<br>\
it is also thus pronounced in a form of swearing;<br>\
as in أَفَاَللّٰهِ لَتَفْعَلَنَّ [an elliptical phrase, as will be<br>\
shown below, meaning Then, by God, wilt thou<br>\
indeed do such a thing?]; though he denies its<br>\
being thus pronounced because it is inseparable;<br>\
regarding it as a substitute for the suppressed<br>\
hemzeh of الإِلَاهُ: (S in the present art.:) Sb<br>\
mentions this pronunciation in يَا اَللّٰهُ; and Th<br>\
mentions the pronunciation of يَا اللّٰهُ also, with the<br>\
conjunctive hemzeh: Ks, moreover, mentions, as<br>\
used by the Arabs, the phrase يَلَهْ اَغْفِرْلِى [O<br>\
God, forgive me], for يَا اللّٰهُ; but this is disapproved. (ISd, TA.) The word is pronounced in<br>\
the manner termed تَفْخِيم, [i. e., with the broad<br>\
sound of the lengthened fet-h, and with a full<br>\
sound of the letter ل,] for the purpose of showing<br>\
honour to it; but when it is preceded by a kesreh,<br>\
[as in بِاللّٰهِ By God, and بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ In the name of<br>\
God,] it is pronounced in the [contr.] manner<br>\
termed تَرْقِيق: AHát says that some of the vulgar<br>\
say, لَاوَاللّٰهْ [No, by God], suppressing the alif,<br>\
which should necessarily be uttered, as in الرَّحْمنُ,<br>\
which is in like manner written without alif; and<br>\
he adds that some person has composed a verse<br>\
in which the alif [in this word] is suppressed,<br>\
erroneously. (Msb.) You say, اَللّٰهَ اللّٰهَ فِى كَذَا,<br>\
[a verb being understood,] meaning Fear ye<br>\
God, fear ye God, with respect to such a thing.<br>\
(Marginal note in a copy of the Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer.<br>\
[See another ex. voce كَرَّةٌ.]) And اَللّٰهَ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ<br>\
and اَللّٰهِ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ [By God, I will assuredly do<br>\
such a thing]: in the former is understood a verb<br>\
significant of swearing; and in the latter, [or in<br>\
both, for a noun is often put in the accus. case<br>\
because of a particle understood,] a particle [such<br>\
as بِ or وَ] denoting an oath. (Bd in ii. 1.) And<br>\
لِلهِ مَا فَعَلْتُ, meaning وَاللّٰهِ مَا فَعَلْتُ [By God, I<br>\
did not, or have not done, such a thing]. (JK.)<br>\
And لِلّهِ دَرُّكَ (tropical:)  To God be attributed thy deed! (A<br>\
in art. در:) or the good that hath proceeded from<br>\
thee! or thy good deed! or thy gift! and what is<br>\
received from thee! [and thy flow of eloquence!<br>\
and the like]: a phrase expressive of admiration<br>\
of anything: (TA in art. در:) [when said to an<br>\
eloquent speaker or poet, it may be rendered<br>\
divinely art thou gifted!]. And لِلّهِ دَرُّهُ (tropical:)  To God be<br>\
attributed his deed! [&amp;c.]. (S and K in art. در.)<br>\
And لِلّهِ القَائِلُ [meaning To God be attributed<br>\
(the eloquence of) the sayer! or] how good, or<br>\
beautiful, is the saying of the sayer, or of him<br>\
who says [such and such words]! or it is like the<br>\
phrase لِلّهِ دَرُّهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  To God be attributed<br>\
his goodness! and his pure action! (Har p. 11.)<br>\
And لِلّهِ فُلَانٌ [To God be attributed (the excel-lence, or goodness, or deed, &amp;c., of) such a one!]<br>\
explained by Az as meaning wonder ye at such a<br>\
one: how perfect is he! (Har ibid.) [And لِلّهِ أَبُوكَ:<br>\
see art. ابو.] And لَاهِ أَنْتَ, meaning لِلّهِ أَنْتَ [lit.<br>\
To God be thou attributed! i. e. to God be attributed thine excellence! or thy goodness! or thy<br>\
deed! &amp;c.]. (JK.) [Similar to لِلّهِ, thus used, is<br>\
the Hebrew expression<br>\
לֵאלֹהּי� after an epithet<br>\
signifying “great” or the like.] إِنَّالِلّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ<br>\
رَاجِعُونَ, in the Kur [ii. 151], said on the occasion<br>\
of an affliction, means Verily to God we belong,<br>\
as property and servants, He doing with us what<br>\
He willeth, and verily unto Him we return in<br>\
the ultimate state of existence, and He will<br>\
recompense us. (Jel.) AZ mentions the phrase<br>\
الحَمْدُلَاهِ [meaning الحَمْدُلِلّهِ Praise be to God]:<br>\
but this is not allowable in the Kur-án: it is only<br>\
related as heard from the Arabs of the desert, and<br>\
those not knowing the usage of the Kur-án. (Az,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ↓ اَللّهُمَّ is an expression used in prayer;<br>\
as also لَاهُمَّ; (JK, Msb;) meaning يَا اَللّٰهُ [O<br>\
God]; the م being a substitute for [the suppressed<br>\
vocative particle] يا; (S in art. ليه, and Bd in<br>\
iii. 25;) but one says also, يَا اَللّهُمَّ, (JK, and S<br>\
ibid,) by poetic licence: (S ibid:) or the meaning,<br>\
accord. to some, is يَا اَللّٰهُ أُمَّنَا بِخَيْرٍ [O God, bring<br>\
us good]; (JK, and Bd ubi suprà;) and hence<br>\
the origin of the expression. (Bd.) You say also<br>\
اَللّهُمَّ إِلَّا [which may be rendered, inversely, Unless, indeed; or unless, possibly]: the former word<br>\
being thus used to denote that the exception is<br>\
something very rare. (Mtr in the commencement<br>\
of his Expos. of the Makámát of El-Hareeree,<br>\
and Har pp. 52 and 53.) And اَللّهُمَّ نَعَمْ [which<br>\
may be rendered, inversely, Yes, indeed; or yea,<br>\
verily]: the former word being used in this case<br>\
as corroborative of the answer to an interrogation,<br>\
negative and affirmative. (Har p. 563.)<br>\
