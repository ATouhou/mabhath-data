كَادَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا, (S, K, * &amp;c,) [originally<br>\
كَوِدَ,] first pers. كِدْتُ, accord. to the usage of<br>\
most of the Arabs, (IKtt,) aor. يَكَادُ, (S, K, &amp;c.,)<br>\
the form used by all the Arabs, (IKtt.) or يَكُودُ<br>\
[is also used, by some of those who make the<br>\
pret. to be originally كَوُدَ], (Lth,) inf. n. كَوْدٌ<br>\
(Lth, S, M, K, &amp;c) and كَادٌ (M, IKtt) and مَكَادَةٌ<br>\
(Lth, S, M, K, &amp;c.) and مَكَادٌ; (Lth, M, K;)<br>\
and كَادَ, originally كَوُدَ, deviating from constant rule, (MF,) first pers. كُدْتُ, (S, IKtt,<br>\
MF,) in the dial. of the Benoo-&#39;Adee, (MF,)<br>\
mentioned by Sb as heard from some of the<br>\
Arabs, (S,) aor. يَكَادُ, (IKtt,) deviating from constant rule, (MF,) [and يَكُودُ, mentioned above,<br>\
agreeably with rule;] as also كَادَ, (Msb, K, art.<br>\
كيد,) originally كَيِدَ, first pers. كِدْتُ, aor.<br>\
يَكَادُ, (Msb, art. كيد,) inf. n. كَيْدٌ; (L, art.<br>\
كيد;) and كِيدَ, (S, K, &amp;c.,) a form mentioned<br>\
by Abu-l-Khattáb to Sb, as used by some of the<br>\
Arabs, who in like manner said مَا زِيلَ يَفْعَلُ<br>\
كَذَا, for كَادَ and زَالَ; (S;) He was near to<br>\
doing so; he nearly, well nigh, or almost, did so;<br>\
he wanted but little of doing so; (Akh, S, M, K,<br>\
&amp;c.;) he purposed, or intended, doing so; (Lth,<br>\
M, IKtt;) but did it not, [or did it not immediately]. (Akh, S, K, &amp;c.) كَادَ is applied<br>\
to signify the being near to doing a thing<br>\
whether it be [afterwards] done or not done. (S.)<br>\
Without a negative, it enunciates the negation of<br>\
the action; and coupled with a negative, it enunciates the happening of the action. (S, K.) [This<br>\
will be explained in the course of the following<br>\
observations.] It is (as Es-Suyootee says in the<br>\
Itkán) an incomplete [i. e. a non-attributive]<br>\
verb, of which only the pret. and aor. are used.<br>\
It has a noun as the subject, in the nom. case;<br>\
and an aor., [generally] without أَنْ, as the predicate. (TA.) Sometimes they introduce أَنْ<br>\
after it, likening it to عَسَى; as, for ex., in the<br>\
saying of Ru-beh,<br>\
قَدْ كَادَ مِنْ طُولِ البِلَى أَنْ يَمْصَحَا<br>\
[It had nearly come to nought from length of<br>\
wear]. (S.) Used affirmatively, it is affirmative<br>\
of the being near [to doing a thing, &amp;c.]; and<br>\
used negatively, it is negative thereof. It is a<br>\
well-known opinion of many, that, used affirmatively, it is negative; and used negatively, it<br>\
is affirmative: so that كَادَ زَيْدٌ يَفْعَلُ means<br>\
[Zeyd was near to doing; but] he did not [or did<br>\
not immediately]; as is shown by the expression<br>\
[in the Kur xvii. 75, where إِنْ is a contraction<br>\
of إِنَّ,] وَإِنْ كَادُوا لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ [And verily they<br>\
were near to seducing thee]: and مَا كَادَ يَفْعَلُ<br>\
means [He was not near to doing; but] he did;<br>\
as is shown by the expression [in the Kur ii. 66,]<br>\
وَمَا كَادُوا يَفْعَلُونَ [And they were not near to<br>\
doing (it); but they afterwards did (it)]. I&#39;Ab<br>\
is related to have said, that wherever كَادَ and<br>\
أَكَادُ and يَكَادُ occur in the Kur-án, they denote<br>\
a thing&#39;s never happening. Some say, that<br>\
كَادَ [with a negative] denotes an action&#39;s happening with difficulty. Some, again, say, that<br>\
the pret. preceded by a negative is affirmative<br>\
[of the action &amp;c.]; as is shown by the expression<br>\
وَمَا كَادُوا يَفْعَلُونَ [quoted above]: and that the<br>\
aor. preceded by a negative is negative; as is<br>\
shown by the expression [in the Kur xxiv, 40,]<br>\
لَمْ يَكَدْ يَرَاهَا [He is not near to seeing it];<br>\
meaning that he sees not anything: [though this<br>\
phrase is said to bear a different meaning, which<br>\
see below]. But the correct opinion is the one<br>\
first mentioned; that, used affirmatively, it is<br>\
affirmative [of the being near to do a thing &amp;c.];<br>\
and used negatively, it is negative [thereof]:<br>\
so that كَادَ يَفْعَلُ signifies He was near to<br>\
doing; but did not [or did not immediately]:<br>\
and مَا كَادَ يَفْعَلُ He was not near to doing;<br>\
much less did he do [or do immediately]; the<br>\
denial of the action [or of the immediate performance of the action] being necessarily understood from the denial of the being near to do it.<br>\
As to the expression in the Kur, وَمَا كَادُوا يَفْعَلُونَ<br>\
[quoted above], it enunciates the state of the<br>\
people to whom it relates in the beginning of<br>\
their case; for they were far from sacrificing the<br>\
cow; and the affirmation of the action is understood only from the [preceding] expression<br>\
فَذَبَحُوهَا. And as to the expression [in the Kur<br>\
xvii. 76,] لَقَدْ كِدتَّ تَرْكَنُ إِلَيْهِمْ [Thou hadst<br>\
certainly been near to inclining to them], the<br>\
Prophet&#39;s not inclining to them little or much<br>\
is understood from لَوْلَا [preceding], which requires this inference. (TA.) [Often, however,<br>\
or (as some say) generally, with a negative<br>\
preceding or following it, it is affirmative of the<br>\
action&#39;s happening, but only after difficulty, or<br>\
delay.] Aboo-Bekr says, that مَا كَادَ فُلَانٌ يَقُومُ<br>\
means [Such a one hardly, or scarcely, or tardily,<br>\
rose; like لَمْ يَكَدْ يَقُومُ, and كَادَ لَا يَقُومُ; وَقَدْ قَامَ<br>\
being understood; or] he rose after being slow,<br>\
or tardy: (L:) and accord. to Az and others,<br>\
مَا كِدْتُ أَفْعَلُ means [I hardly, or scarcely, or<br>\
tardily, did; or] I did after being slow, or<br>\
tardy: but sometimes it means I was not near<br>\
to doing. (Msb, art. كيد.) It is said, that<br>\
كَادَ is sometimes a [mere redundant] connective<br>\
(صِلَة) of the members of a sentence; (Kutr,<br>\
Akh, AHát, K;) as in لَمْ يَكَدْ يَرَاهَا [quoted<br>\
above], meaning, He does not see it: (K:)<br>\
or this means he is not near to seeing it: or,<br>\
as some say, he sees it after his having been not<br>\
near to seeing it by reason of the intenseness of<br>\
the darkness: [or he hardly, or scarcely, or<br>\
tardily, sees it:] and Fr says, with reference to<br>\
the verse in which this phrase occurs, that it is<br>\
allowable to say لَمْ يَكَدْ يَقُومُ [meaning, He<br>\
hardly, or scarcely, or tardily, rose] when one<br>\
has risen after difficulty. (TA.) [Thus it<br>\
appears, that, مَا كَادَ يَفْعَلُ and لَمْ يَكَدْ يَفْعَلُ<br>\
sometimes signify He hardly, or scarcely, or<br>\
tardily, did: and sometimes, he was not near to<br>\
doing; he never did; he did not at all: so that<br>\
it may be rendered he hardly or scarcely, or<br>\
nowise or in nowise or never, did: or he could<br>\
hardly do, or he could not at all, or could not<br>\
nearly, or he could nowise or in nowise, do.] ―<br>\

As asserts his having heard certain of the Arabs<br>\
say, لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ وَلَا كَوْدًا [I will not do that,<br>\
nor will I be near to doing it]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  كَادَ also<br>\
signifies He desired; syn. أَرَادَ. (Akh, S, K.)<br>\
So in the verse<br>\
كَادَتْ وَكِدْتُ وَتِلْكَ خَيْرُ إِرَادَةٍ<br>\
لَوْ عَادَ مِنْ لَهْوِ الصَّبَابَةِ مَا مَضَى<br>\
[She desired, and I desired; and that were the<br>\
best of desire, if what hath passed, of the<br>\
diverting delight of tender love, returned]. (Akh,<br>\
S.) So, too, in the saying in the Kur [xx. 15,]<br>\
أَكَادُ أُخْفِيهَا I desire (S, K) to conceal it: or,<br>\
to manifest it: (Beyd:) for, like as it is<br>\
allowable to put أُرِيدُ in the place of أَكَادُ, as in<br>\
the saying in the Kur [xviii. 76,] جِدَارًا يُرِيدُ<br>\
أَنْ يَنْقَضَّ, so it is to use اكاد [in the place of<br>\
اريد]: Akh says, that the words of the verse<br>\
in question mean I will conceal it, أُخْفِيهَا: and<br>\
some say, that the meaning is I will manifest it:<br>\
(TA:) but most hold, that اكاد should here be<br>\
rendered in its original sense. (MF, TA.)<br>\
Some of the Arabs make كاد to denote certainty; like ظَنَّ, which primarily denotes doubt,<br>\
and secondarily certainty. (L, art. كيد.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
عَرَفَ مَا يُكَادُ مِنْهُ [is in like manner explained]<br>\
He hath become acquainted with that which is<br>\
desired of him. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  You say to him<br>\
who seeks of you a thing, when you do not desire<br>\
to give him it, لَا وَلَا مَكَادَةَ وَلَا مَهَمَّةَ, (Lth, S, *<br>\
L, K, *) and لَا كَوْدًا وَلَا هَمًّا, and لَا مَكَادًا وَلَا مَهَمًّا,<br>\
(Lth, L,) i. e. لَا أَكَادُ وَلَا أَهُمُّ [No, nor do I desire,<br>\
nor do I purpose, or intend]. (Lth, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  You<br>\
also say, in the same sense, لَا مَهَمَّةَ لِى وَلَا مَكَادَةَ<br>\
[I have no purpose or intention, nor any desire].<br>\
(S) ―<br>\
