كَوْكَبٌ i. q.نَجْمٌ, A star; an asterism; a<br>\

word; the و being a radical letter: it is also said to<br>\
be from وكب, or from كوب; though ك is not<br>\
one of the letters of augmentation; so that here it<br>\
must be augmentative contrary to rule. (TA.)<br>\
[But I rather think that it is an arabicized<br>\
word, from the Hebrew<br>\
כוֹכָב; and that ignorance<br>\
of its being so has caused the Arabs to dispute<br>\
respecting its formation.] ―<br>\
