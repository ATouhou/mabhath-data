كَلَأَهُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
كَلَاَ, inf. n. كَلْءٌ (K) and<br>\
كِلَآءَةٌ (S, K) and كِلَآءٌ (K) [but respecting this<br>\
last see a verse of Jemeel cited below], He (i. e.<br>\
God, S) guarded him, or kept him, or kept him<br>\
safely. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  إِذْهَبُوا فِى كِلَآءَةِ اللّٰهِ Go ye<br>\
in the safe keeping of God. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  In<br>\
the following verse of Jemeel,<br>\
فَكُونِى بِخَيْرٍ فِى كِلَآءِ وَغِبْطَةٍ<br>\
وَإِنْ كُنْتِ قَدْ أَزْمَعْتِ صَرْمِى وَبِغْضَتِى<br>\
[Then be thou in prosperity, in safe keeping (of<br>\
God), and in happy condition, even if thou have<br>\
firmly resolved to cut me and to detest me],<br>\
كِلَآءٌ may be an inf. n.; or it may be pl. of<br>\
كِلَأءَةٌ; or it may be put for كِلَآءَةٌ, the ة being<br>\
elided by a necessary poetical licence. (Abu-l-<br>\
Hasan.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The verb is also used without hemzeh, thus; كَلَاتُ, يَكْلُوكُمْ; and كَلَيْتُ, يَكْلَاكُمْ;<br>\
in the dial. of Kureysh; inf. n. كِلَايَةٌ: as the<br>\
pass. part. n. of both, مَكْلُوٌّ is more commonly<br>\
used than مَكْلِىٌّ, which is correctly used as the<br>\
pass. part. n. of كَلَيْتُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  كَلَأَ القَوْمَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He acted as a scout (رَبِيْئَة) for the party, or<br>\

[in the CK نَظَرَهُ,]) or ↓ أَكْلَأَهُ, (S,) He repeatedly<br>\

part. n. كَالِئٌ, (A,) The debt, or its payment,<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  كَلَأَ عُمْرُهُ (tropical:)  His life came to an end: (K:)<br>\
or was long, and was delayed. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  كَلَأَ<br>\
[unless this be a mistake for ↓ كلّأ] He postponed,<br>\
or delayed, a thing. (TA, art. نَسَأَ.)<br>\

كلّأ, inf. n. تَكْلِىْءٌ and تَكْلِئَةٌ, He brought<br>\
a ship near to the bank of the river, (K,) and<br>\
moored it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  كلّأ (assumed tropical:)  He retained, detained, or confined, a person: (K:) app. from<br>\
the verb as used with reference to a ship;<br>\
and therefore tropical. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  كلّأ, (K,) inf.<br>\
n. تَكْلِىْءٌ, (TA,) He came to a place, and stopped<br>\
there. (TA.) ―<br>\

-b2-  كلّأفِيهِ (tropical:)  He<br>\

إِكْلَآءٌ; (S;) He paid in advance (أَسْلَمَ, K,<br>\
and أَسْلَفَ, S, K) for corn or other food, &amp;c.<br>\
(S, K, TA.) [Here the original signification<br>\
of postponement or delay is involved: for he<br>\
who pays in advance for a thing grants a delay<br>\
in the delivery thereof.] IAar cites the following<br>\
verse:<br>\
فَمَنْ يُحْسِنْ إِلَيْهِمْ لَا يُكَلَِّئْ<br>\
إِلَى جَازٍ بِذَاكَ وَلَا كَرِيمِ<br>\
[So that he who does a good action to them does<br>\
not pay in advance to one who will recompence<br>\

(TA.) See 1 and 5.<br>\

5<br>\
تكلّأ; and ↓ كلّأ, inf. n. تَكْلِىْءٌ; He bought<br>\
on credit. [This is the explanation given in the<br>\
TK, and it appears to be correct. It is also<br>\
there said, that تَكَلَّأْتُهُ signifies أَخَذْتُهُ نَسْيْئَةً,<br>\
I took it, or bought it, on credit: and كَلَّأْتُ فِى<br>\
الطَّعَامِ, اخذته بالنّسيئةِ, I took, or bought, the<br>\
food on credit, but the latter I render differently. (See 2, above.) In the K we read الكَالِئُ<br>\
والكُلْأَةُ بِالضَّمِّ النَّسِيْئَةُ والعُرْبُونُ وتَكَلَّأْتُ وكَلَّأْتُ تَكْلِيْئًا<br>\
أخَذْتُهُ. IbrD thinks that the last word should<br>\
be أخَّرْتُ “ I postponed, or delayed ”: but I<br>\
rather think that it should be أَخَذْتُهَا, meaning<br>\
أَخَذْتُ نَسِيْئَةً I took, or bought, on credit. in the<br>\
TA we read, AO says, تَكَلَّأْتُ كُلْأَةً وكَلَّأْتُ<br>\
تَكْلِيْئًا إِسْتَنْسَأْتُ نَسِيْئَةَ أَىْ أَخَذْتُهُ وَالنَّسِيْئَةُ التَّأْخِيرُ<br>\
وَكَذٰلِكَ إِسْتَكْلَأْتُ كُلْأَةً: but the words اى<br>\
اخذته seem to have been added by SM; for<br>\
in the S we find, on the authority of AO,<br>\
تَكَلَّأْتُ أَىْ ا@سْسَنْسَأْتُ نَسِيْئَةً وَكَذٰلِكَ ا@سْتَكْلَأْتُ كُلْأَةً<br>\
بِالضَّمِّ وَهُوَ مِنَ التَّأْخِيرِ: whence it seems, that<br>\
تكلّأ, (or تكلّأ كُلْأَةً, and كُلْأَةً ↓ كلّأ, see above,)<br>\
and كُلأَةً ↓ الستكلأ, signify He asked for a delay<br>\
of the period of the payment of a debt.] See 8.<br>\
8<br>\
اكتلأ مِنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  He preserved, or guarded, himself from him or it; had a care of, or was<br>\
cautious of, him or it. (S, K. *) ―<br>\

-A2-  اكتلأ كُلْأَةً, and ↓ تكلّأها, He received a كُلْأَة<br>\
[i. e., an earnest, or money paid in advance].<br>\

صِلَّيَان نَصِىّ, حَلَمَة, شِيح, عَرْفَج, the various<br>\
kinds of عُرْوَة, and what are termed عُشْب, بَقْل,<br>\

كَلَّآءٌ and ↓ مُكَلَّأٌ A station of ships, (S, K,)<br>\
near the bank of a river, or near what is<br>\
called the جُدّ: (TA:) the former is masc.<br>\
and fem.; or, accord. to Sb, it is of the measure<br>\
فَعَّالٌ; and therefore masc., and perfectly declinable: (S:) so called because it keeps the vessels<br>\
safe (يَكْلَؤُهَا) from the wind: but accord. to Th,<br>\
it is of the measure فَعْلَآءُ; and therefore fem.,<br>\
[and imperfectly declinable; from كَلَّ;] so<br>\

مَشَى عَلَى الكَلَّآءِ أَلْقَيْنَاهُ فِى النَّهْرِ, (TA,) or قَذَفْنَاهُ<br>\
فِى النَّهْرِ, (K in art. عرض,) or فى المَآءِ, (TA<br>\
in that art.) (tropical:)  Him who indirectly calumniates<br>\
we will treat in a similar manner; (meaning,<br>\
we will inflict upon him a chastisement less than<br>\
that termed الحَدّ;) and him who walks upon<br>\
the bank of the river (i. e., who openly calumniates, and so, as it were, embarks on the river<br>\
of the حُدُود, [pl. of حَدٌّ,]) we will cast into that<br>\
river; meaning, we will inflict upon him the<br>\
chastisement termed الحَدّ. (TA; and K * in<br>\
art. عرض.)<br>\
كَالِئٌ (S, K) and ↓ كُلْأَةٌ (K) i. q. نَسِيْئَةٌ, [app.<br>\
bearing both of the two significations immediately<br>\
following, and clearly shown in the S &amp;c. to<br>\
bear the latter of them: A postponement, or<br>\
delay, in the time of the payment of a debt, &amp;c.<br>\
See also نُسْأَةٌ, and كَلَأَ. ―<br>\

to be paid at a future time for a similar debt.<br>\
(S, TA.) [See the Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer, and Mishkát el-Masábeeh, ii., 21.] What is forbidden<br>\
by this is, a man&#39;s buying a thing on credit for<br>\
a certain period, and, when the period of payment<br>\
is come, and he finds not that wherewith to pay<br>\
the debt, his saying, Sell it to me on credit for a<br>\
further period, for something additional: whereupon he [thus] sells it to him: (TK:) or, a<br>\
man&#39;s paying money for, wheat, or the like, to<br>\
be given at a certain period, and, when the<br>\
period comes, the debtor&#39;s saying, I have not<br>\
