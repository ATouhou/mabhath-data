among us;] meaning, it was left collected together before us. (TA, from a trad.) كَثَبَ القَوْمَ<br>\

كَثَبَ كِنَانَتَهُ He turned his quiver upside down,<br>\

the right reading is نَكَبَهَا. (TA.) ―<br>\

From [كَثَبٌ as signifying] “ nearness. ” (TA.)<br>\

كثّب, inf. n. تَكْثِيبٌ, It [a number of<br>\
things, or a quantity,] was, or became, few, or<br>\
little. The inf. n. is explained in the K by the<br>\

كَثَبُوكُمْ فَا@رْمُوهُمْ بِالنَّبْلِ When they draw near to<br>\

two verbs are syn. The phrase is a proverb.<br>\

mention the former reading in the K.)<br>\
كُثَابٌ Many, or much: (K:) a syn. of كُبَابٌ,<br>\
q. v.: you say نَعَمٌ كُثَابٌ, meaning Many camels,<br>\

(S, K) and كُثُبٌ and أَكْثِبَةٌ: (K:) [the last a<br>\

horseman falls [when he mounts]: (S:) or the<br>\
elevated part of the منسج: or the part from the<br>\
root of the neck to the part between the shoulders:<br>\
or the place where the shoulders unite, before the<br>\
saddle; [i. e. the withers]: pl. كَوَاثِبُ (TA)<br>\
and أَكْثَابٌ: (K:) but of the latter pl. ISd<br>\
