كَرَثَهُ, aor.<br>\
كَرُثَ (and<br>\
كَرِثَ, TA, as from the K,<br>\
inf. n. كَرْثٌ; TA) and ↓ اكرثهُ; It (grief, S,<br>\
and an affair, TA) pressed severely upon him;<br>\
oppressed him; afflicted him; distressed him;<br>\
vexed him: (S, K, TA:) [as also قَرَثَهُ]. As<br>\
rejects the first form, although Ru-beh uses the<br>\
expression. [You say,] كَرَثَنِى الأَمْرُ The thing<br>\
grieved and oppressed me: (As, in TA [but see<br>\
above:] or pained me. (AA, Skr. p. 20.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
كَرَثَهُ الأَمْرُ The affair moved him. (A)<br>\
4<br>\
أَكْرَثَ see 1.<br>\
7<br>\
انكرث It (a rope) broke. (K.)<br>\
8<br>\
اكترث He was oppressed, afflicted, distressed, or vexed. (Lth.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَا أَكْتَرِثُ لَهُ (in<br>\
some copies of the S, بِهِ, which is more common,<br>\
MF) I care not for him, or it: (S, K:) or<br>\
I am not moved by, and do not care for, mind,<br>\
heed, or regard, him, or it: (A:) or, as some say,<br>\
I turn not my face towards him, or it: like<br>\
أَلْتَفِتُ. (TA.) The affirmative phrase أَكْتَرِثُ لَهُ<br>\
is a deviation from ordinary usage. (Nh.)<br>\
كَرَاثٌ [coll. gen. n.] A certain kind of large<br>\
trees, (K,) growing on the mountains. (AHn.)<br>\
[F mentions his having seen them on the mountains of Et-Táïf.]<br>\
-A2-  And see كُرَّاثٌ.<br>\
كَرِيثٌ: see كَارِثٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  إِنَّهُ لَكَرِيثُ الأَمْرِ [Verily<br>\
he is in oppressive, afflicting, or distressing, circumstances; or timid, and retiring]: said when<br>\
one is timid, or cowardly, and draws back, or<br>\
desists [from an affair]. (K.) And فُلَانٌ<br>\
كَرِيثٌ عَنِ الأَمْرِ Such a one is a recoiler, or<br>\
shrinker, from the affair. (A in art. ربث.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
كَرِيثٌ is also syn. with ↓ مَكْرُوثٌ [Oppressed,<br>\
afflicted, distressed, or vexed: and app. attended<br>\
with difficulty: see رَبِيثٌ] (T in art. ربث:) or<br>\
كَرِيثٌ and ↓ مَكْرُوثٌ both signify pained. (AA,<br>\
Skr, p. 20.)<br>\
بُسْرٌ كَريثَآءُ, and كَرَاثَآءُ, [in the copies of the<br>\
K, both words are written without tenween;<br>\
if rightly introduced here they would be with<br>\
tenween,] (like قَرِيثَآءُ and قَرَاثَآءُ, TA,) Good, or<br>\
sweet, dates, (K.) full-grown, and ripening.<br>\
(TA.) The leading lexicologists [except the<br>\
author of the K] agree in mentioning كريثاء<br>\
[only] in art. كرث; like قريثاء in قرث: and<br>\
the author of the K mentions both again in<br>\
chapter ث. Ibn-Esh-Sheybánee says, قريثاء and<br>\
كريثاء signify a kind of date (تَمْر): and some<br>\
say, a kind of full-grown, ripening date (بُسْر),<br>\
of a black colour, the skin of which quickly falls<br>\
off: accord. to the Fs, a well-known kind of<br>\
full-grown, green date; and said to be the best,<br>\
or sweetest, kind of date in the full-grown, green<br>\
state (TA.)<br>\
كَرَّاثٌ: see كُرَّاثٌ.<br>\
كُرَّاثٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ كَرَّاثٌ (Kr, K) and<br>\
↓ كَرَاثٌ (Aboo-&#39;Alee El Kálee) [each a coll. gen.<br>\
n.,] A certain herb, or leguminous plant, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) well-known, of foul odour, (Msb, TA,) and<br>\
of disagreeable juice; (TA;) [the common leek;<br>\
or allium porrum of Linn; or leeks:] كُرَّاثَةٌ is a<br>\
more particular term; (Msb;) [i. e. it is the<br>\
n. un. of كَرَّاثٌ, signifying a single leek.]<br>\
أَمْرٌ كَارِثٌ, and ↓ كَرِيثٌ, An affair that presses<br>\
severely upon one; that oppresses, afflicts, distresses, or vexes. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  كَرَثَتْهُ الكَوَارِثُ Affairs<br>\
pressed heavily upon him; or oppressed him. (A.)<br>\
الكُرْبُ الكَوَارِثُ [Oppressive sorrows, or anxieties.]<br>\
(S.) (See Har. p. 245)<br>\
مَكْرُوثٌ: see كَرِيثٌ.<br>\
