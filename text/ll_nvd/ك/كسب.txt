كَسَبَ, aor.<br>\
كَسِبَ, inf. n. كَسْبٌ (S, K, Msb)<br>\
and كِسْبٌ (K), He collected (wealth &amp;c.]; (S,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ اكتسبهُ. (S.) This is the original<br>\
signification. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] He gained, acquired, or earned, wealth or the like; as also<br>\
↓ اكتسب. (Msb.) كَسَبْتُ شَيْئًا and ↓ اكْتَسَبْتُهُ are<br>\
syn., [signifying I gained a thing]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Hence [also], كَسَبَ and ↓ اكتسب (S, K, Msb)<br>\
and ↓ تكسّب (K) He sought, sought after, or<br>\
sought to gain, sustenance, or the like, (S, K,)<br>\
for his family: (Msb:) or كَسَبَ signifies he<br>\
got, or obtained, or gained, acquired, or earned,<br>\
[sustenance, &amp;c.]; and ↓ اكتسب, he applied<br>\
himself with art and diligence [to get, or obtain,<br>\
or gain, acquire, or earn, sustenance &amp;c.; he<br>\
laboured to earn, or gain, sustenance]: (Sb, K:)<br>\
[so] also ↓ تكسّب is explained by تَكَلَّفَ الكَسْبَ<br>\
he applied himself, as to a task, to gain, &amp;c. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  كَسَبَ is also said to signify, and originally,<br>\
both he sought, or sought after, [sustenance]; and<br>\
he laboured in seeking, or seeking after, sustenance. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  ↓ اكتسب has a more intensive signification than كَسَبَ; and hence, in<br>\
the last verse of the second chap. of the Kur<br>\
[لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا ا@كْتَسَبَتْ To it shall be<br>\
given what reward it hath earned, and upon it<br>\
shall be executed what punishment it hath drawn<br>\
upon itself], the latter is used with reference to<br>\
what is good; and the former, with reference to<br>\
what is evil. (IJ.) You say, كَسَبَ خَيْرًا (tropical:)  [He<br>\
gained, or earned, or did, good]: and ↓ اكتسب<br>\
شَرًّا (tropical:)  [He gained, or earned, or did, evil]. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  [This distinction, however, is not always<br>\
observed: for] كَسَبَ signifies, He did either a<br>\
good or an evil deed: [because he who does so<br>\
earns, or draws upon himself, reward or punishment.] (Jel in ii. 281; and iii. 24; &amp;c.) And<br>\
↓ اكتسب He committed an act of which he was<br>\
accusable. (Jel in xxxiii. 58.) كَسَبَ إِثْمًا and<br>\
↓ اكتسبهُ signify He [committed, or] burdened<br>\
himself with (تَحَمَّلَ), a sin, or crime. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  كَسَبَهُ مَالًا, (S, K,) and مالا ↓ اكسبهُ, (IAar,<br>\
IAth, K,) but the former is the more approved:<br>\
the latter is by Fr and some others rejected:<br>\
(TA:) He caused him to gain, acquire, or earn,<br>\
wealth: (IAth, Msb:) or he assisted him to<br>\
gain, acquire, or earn, wealth. (IAth.) كسبهُ<br>\
عِلْمًا He caused him to gain, or acquire, knowledge. (Msb.) [In like manner,] العَبْدَ ↓ اسْتَكْسَبْتُ<br>\
I caused the slave to gain, or make gain; the<br>\
verb having here the sense of the measure أَفْعَلْتُهُ;<br>\
like as اِسْتَخْرَجْتُهُ signifies أَخْرَجْتُهُ. (Msb.) [See<br>\
an ex. voce أَدِيمٌ.] ―<br>\
-b8-  نَهَى عَنْ كَسْبِ الإِمَاءِ [He<br>\
(Mohammad) forbade the making female slaves<br>\
to earn money, or the like, (by prostitution)].<br>\
(TA, from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b9-  مَا كَسَبَ in the Kur<br>\
cxi, 2, is said to signify His children. A man&#39;s<br>\
children are among the things termed his كَسْب.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  كَسَبَهُ عَجَبًا It occasioned, or caused,<br>\
him to wonder. (TA, voce أَعْجَبَ.)<br>\

كَسْبٌ inf. n. of 1. q. v. ―<br>\
-b2-  فُلَانٌ طَيِّبُ الكَسْبِ,<br>\
(S, K,) and ↓ المَكْسَبِ, and ↓ المَكْسِبِ, (K,) and<br>\
↓ المَكْسِبَةِ, and ↓ الكِسْبَةِ, (S, K,) and ↓ الكَسِيبَةِ,<br>\
(IM,) [Such a one makes good gain: كَسْبٌ &amp;c.<br>\
signifying gain, acquisition, or earning: and also<br>\
a deed, whether good or evil].<br>\
كُسْبٌ i. q. كُنجارق [or كَنْجَارَهُ], a Persian<br>\
word, called by some of the people of Es-Sawád<br>\
كُسْبَج [or كُسْبَه; i. e., The dregs of sesamegrain, or the like, from which the oil has been<br>\
expressed]; (TA;) dregs remaining after the<br>\
expression of oil: (S, K:) [as also كُزْبٌ:] from<br>\
the Persian كشب, (AM,) [or rather كُسْبَه, or<br>\
كُسْبَج]. See also تَخٌّ.<br>\

-b2-  A name of a<br>\

(ISd:) as also ↓ كَسْبَةُ: (K:) as ↓ كُسَيْبٌ is<br>\
a name of the dog; i. e., of the male: (K:)<br>\
names thus used as ominous of gain, [or of<br>\
capturing game]: (IM:) كَسَابِ, as a name of<br>\
a hunting bitch, means كَاسِبَةٌ. (TA, art. برح.)<br>\
كَسُوبٌ [so in the copies of the K in my<br>\
hands; but by the place in which it is mentioned<br>\
in the TA, it is implied that it is ↓ كَسُّوبٌ: see<br>\
also لَسُوبٌ] A thing; anything. مَا لَهُ كَسُوبٌ<br>\
He has not anything. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  رَجُلٌ كَسُوبٌ,<br>\
and ↓ كَسَّابٌ, A man who makes much gain.<br>\

الكَوَاسِبُ i. q. الجَوَارِحُ, (S, K,) here meaning<br>\
The members (either of a man or of a bird) by<br>\
means of which is gained, acquired, or earned,<br>\
sustenance, or the like. (MF.) [The explanation<br>\
in the TA, الجَوَارِحُ مِنَ الإِنْسَانِ وَالطَّيْرِ, seems,<br>\
at first sight, to signify preyers, whether men or<br>\
birds: but this meaning I do not think to be the<br>\
one intended.]<br>\
أَبُو كَاسِبٍ The wolf. (K.)<br>\
اِكْتِسَابِىٌّ [Acquired knowledge, such as is acquired by study: as also ↓ كَسْبِىٌّ:] opp. to<br>\

such as the creature has by [Divine] appointment.<br>\
