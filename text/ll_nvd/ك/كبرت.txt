كَبْرَتَ بَعِيرَهُ He smeared his camel over<br>\
with كِبْرِيت [or sulphur], (K,) mixed with<br>\
grease, and with خَضَخَاض, which is a kind of<br>\
نِفْط [or naphtha], black, and of a thin consistence;<br>\
not قَطِرَان; for this is the black, thick, expressed<br>\
juice of a certain tree. (TS.) This is done to<br>\
cure the scab, for the removal of which it is<br>\
very efficacious. (TA.)<br>\
كِبْرِيتٌ [Brimstone, or sulphur;] a thing well<br>\
known; (S, art. كبر;) one of the kinds of stone<br>\
with which fire is kindled, or it (red كبريت TA)<br>\
is a mineral whereof the mine is beyond EtTubbat, [or the country of Et-Tibbet, in Tartary,] in the Valley of the Ants, (K,) by which<br>\
Solomon passed, (TA,) [as related in the Kur,<br>\
xxvii. 18]: or [the product of] a spring, or<br>\
source, whereof the water, when it congeals,<br>\
becomes white, and yellow, and dusky-coloured,<br>\
كبريت: (Lth, in the T:) MF says, I have<br>\
seen it in several places; among these, in one<br>\
which is near El-Maláleeh, between Fás and<br>\
Miknáseh; by swimming in which, persons are<br>\
cured of the venereal disease, and other disorders:<br>\
also in Africa Proper, in the midst of Barkah,<br>\
in a place called البرج; and in other places:<br>\
(TA:) Aristotle says, that, among the different<br>\
kinds of كبريت are the red, of an excellent<br>\
colour; and the white, which resembles dust; and<br>\
the yellow: the source of the red is in the West:<br>\
it does not appear in its place: the yellow is found<br>\
near the ocean, a league (or leagues, as in the<br>\
TA,) from it: it is useful in cases of epilepsy,<br>\
and apoplexy, and megrim, and palpitation:<br>\
and it enters into the preparations of gold: the<br>\
white blackens white substances; and it is sometimes mixed and concealed in the sources of<br>\
running water, which sources have a fetid odour:<br>\
the person who plunges into these waters in times<br>\
when the air is temperate is cured by them of<br>\
wounds, and swellings, and scab, and wind in the<br>\
womb, and [the leprosy called] سَلَع, that arises<br>\
from black bile: Ibn-Seenà [Avicenna] also says,<br>\
that كبريت, untouched by fire, is one of the<br>\
remedies for the leprosy (بَرَص): that, mixed with<br>\
the gum of the turpentine-tree, it removes marks<br>\
on the nails: that, mixed with vinegar, it removes<br>\
the [leprous-like discolouration of the skin called]<br>\
بَهَق, and the ringworm, or tetter, (قُوَبَاء,) especially<br>\
with the gum of the turpentine-tree: that, with<br>\
natron and water, it is an embrocation for the<br>\
بَرَص [or, as in the TA, for the نِقْرِس, or gout):<br>\
and that fumigation therewith stops a rheum:<br>\
and others say, that, if yellow كبريت be powdered, and sprinkled upon a place affected with<br>\
سلعة, it has a good effect: that fumigation<br>\
therewith whitens the hair: that serpents and<br>\
fleas flee from the scent of it, especially if [mixed]<br>\
with an unguent, or with the hoof of an ass; and<br>\
that the fumigation therewith beneath a citrontree of the kind called أُتْرُجّ causes all the fruits of<br>\
it to fall. (El-Kazweenee.) Several authors<br>\
say, that the ت in كبريت is an augmentative<br>\
letter, and that the proper place of the word is<br>\
in art. كبر. IDrd thinks it to be not genuine<br>\
Arabic. (TA.) [Golius thinks it to be from<br>\
the Persian كُوكُرْدْ (or كُوكُرْدْ): or rather, he<br>\
adds, from the Hebrew<br>\
נּפְּרִיח Gen. xix. 24.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
أَعَزُّمِنَ الكِبْرِيتِ الأَحْمَرِ [More rare than red<br>\
brimstone, or sulphur]. A proverb. Some say,<br>\
that كبريت احمر [meaning as above] is a thing<br>\
that does not exist: others, that by it is meant<br>\
gold. (Meyd.) This phrase is similar to أَعَزُّ<br>\
مِنْ بَيْضِ الأَنُوقِ. (S, art. كبر.) ―<br>\
-b3-  كِبْرِيتٌ also<br>\
signifies gold: (K:) [see above:] or red gold:<br>\
or red [as an epithet applied to gold]: (TA:) or<br>\
pure, as an epithet applied to gold. (S, art.<br>\
كبر.) Ru-beh says,<br>\
هَلْ يَنْفَعَنِّى كَذِبٌ سِخْتِيتُ<br>\
أَوْ فِضَّةٌ أَوْ ذَهَبٌ كِبْرِيتُ<br>\
[Will vehement lying profit me, or silver, or<br>\
pure gold?] (S, art. كبر.) IAar says, Ru-beh<br>\
imagined that كبريت meant gold: upon which<br>\
MF observes, that the ancient Arabs erred with<br>\
respect to meanings, though not with respect to<br>\
words. The latter author, however, supposes<br>\
كبريت to be fig. used as signifying gold; for<br>\
they use the expression الكبريت الاحمر [as applied<br>\
to gold] because gold is [said to be] prepared<br>\
therefrom, and it is used in alchymical processes.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  كِبْرِيتٌ also signifies The red jacinth,<br>\
or ruby; syn. يَاقُوتٌ أَحْمَرُ. (K.)<br>\
