كَمْثَرَ, inf. n. كَمْثَرَةٌ, It became compact,<br>\
one part of it entering into another, or parts into<br>\
parts: (K: [but only the inf. n. is there<br>\
mentioned:]) an obsolete verb: (TA:) whence<br>\
the following word, (IDrd, K,) if it be Arabic.<br>\
(IDrd.)<br>\
كُمَّثْرًى (S, Msb, K,) a [coll.] gen. n., with<br>\
tenween, and, accord. to some, كُمَثْرًى, without<br>\
teshdeed, but others disallow this, (Msb,) A<br>\
certain kind of fruit; (T, S;) well known;<br>\
[namely, the pear;] called by [some of] the<br>\
vulgar إِجَّاصٌ: (T:) [it is called by this latter<br>\
name, and also إِنْجَاص and إِنْجَاس, in Syria;<br>\
but in Egypt and some other countries, كُمَّثْرَى:]<br>\
n. un. كُمَّثْرَاةٌ: (S, Msb, K:) pl. كُمَّثْرَيَاتٌ:<br>\
(K:) [here I find added in the TA, it is fem.,<br>\
imperfectly decl.; and in the K, “ and sometimes<br>\
it is masc. ”: but this is evidently wrong: it is<br>\
masc., and with tenween, as is shown by its<br>\
n. un.; but it is sometimes made fem., and then<br>\
it must be written كُمَّثْرَى, without tenween:<br>\
for it is added,] and one says, هٰذِهِ كُمَّثْرَى وَاحِدَةٌ<br>\
[this is one pear: in the copies of the K in my<br>\
possession erroneously written كُمَّثْرًى]: and<br>\
هٰذِهِ كُمَّثْرَى كَثِيرَةٌ [these are many pears]. (K.)<br>\
Its dim. has the following forms: كُمَيْمِثْرَةٌ, (K,)<br>\
which is the most agreeable with analogy, (ISd,<br>\
TA,) and كُمَيْمِثْرِيَةٌ, (K,) which is the form<br>\
adopted by those who make the pl. كمَّثْرَيَاتٌ,<br>\
(ISk, TA,) and كُمَيْثِرَةٌ, (K,) which is the best<br>\
form, (ISk, TA,) and كُمَيْمِثْرَاةٌ. (K.) Az<br>\
says, I have asked a number of Arabs of the<br>\
desert respecting the كمثرّى, but they knew it<br>\
not. (TA.)<br>\
