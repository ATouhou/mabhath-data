كسج, [app. كَسِجَ, aor.<br>\
كَسَجَ,] inf. n. كسج,<br>\
[app. كَسَجٌ,] He had no beard grown; [was<br>\
naturally beardless]. From this it would seem<br>\
that كوسج is an Arabic word. (IKoot, Msb.)<br>\
Q. Q. 1<br>\
كَوْسَجَ He was, or become, what is<br>\
termed كَوْسَجٌ; (K;) from which latter word<br>\
the verb is derived. (Shifa el-Ghaleel.)<br>\
Q. Q. 2<br>\
مَنْ طَانَتْ لِحْيَتُهُ تَكَوْسَجَ عَقْلُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [He<br>\
whose beard becometh long, his intellect becometh<br>\
small.] (TA.)<br>\
كَوْسَجٌ (Th, S, K, &amp;c.) and كُوسَجٌ, (Fr, K,)<br>\
thus pronounced by some of the Arabs agreeably<br>\
with its Persian original, (Fr,) but this latter<br>\
form is disapproved by Yaakoob and ISk and<br>\
IDrst, (TA,) and AHei says that صُوبَجٌ and<br>\
سُوسَنٌ are the only words of the measure فُوعَلٌ,<br>\
(MF,) and كُوسُجٌ, (Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee,)<br>\
a more strange form than that immediately preceding, (MF,) a word of well-known meaning,<br>\
(K,) A man having no hair upon the side of his<br>\
face [but only upon his chin]; (M;) i. q. أَثَطُّ;<br>\
(M, S;) whose cheeks are clear of hair; (Expositions of the Fs) [used in the present day to<br>\
signify having a scanty, or small, beard, and that<br>\
only on the chin:] an arabicized word, (S, &amp;c,)<br>\
originally كوسق, (Msb,) [or rather كُوسَهْ, which<br>\
is Persian]. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, Deficient in the teeth:<br>\
(As, K:) from the Persian كوزه, (Sb,) [or<br>\
rather كُوسَهْ]: [pl. كَوَسِجُ, occurring in the<br>\
TA in art. ثط.] A woman said to her husband<br>\
Thou art كوسج: to which he replied, if I be<br>\
كوسج, thou art divorced. And the matter being<br>\
referred to the Imám Aboo-Haneefeh, he said,<br>\
Let his teeth be numbered; and if they be<br>\
twenty-eight, he is كوسج, and his wife is<br>\
divorced from him; but if they be thirty-two, he<br>\
is not so, and she is not divorced. And they<br>\
were numbered, and found to be thirty-two<br>\
(MF.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, [The Xiphias, or sword-fish;]<br>\
a certain fish (of the sea, S) that has a snout like<br>\
a saw, (S, K,) and eats men; i. q. لَخْمٌ, (TA,)<br>\
and جَمَلُ المَآءِ, (Mgh in art. جمل,) or جَمَلُ البَحْرِ.<br>\
(TA in that art.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, A slow hackney, or<br>\
nag. (A, K.)<br>\
