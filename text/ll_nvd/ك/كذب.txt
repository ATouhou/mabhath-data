كَذَبَ, aor.<br>\
كَذِبَ, inf. n. كَذِبٌ (a strange form<br>\
of inf. n.; there being, accord. to Kz., only<br>\
fourteen instances of it; as لَعِبٌ, and ضَحِكٌ, &amp;c.;<br>\
though there are many substantives of this<br>\
measure; MF) and كِذْبٌ (S, K: accord. to<br>\
Ibn-Es-Seed and others, this latter is formed<br>\
from the former, by putting the second vowel of<br>\
the former in the place of the first: MF) and<br>\
كَذِبَةٌ (L) or كَذْبَةٌ (K) and كِذْبَهٌ (L, K) and<br>\
كِذَابٌ and كِذَّابٌ (K: but this last, which is<br>\
also assigned to كَذَبَ in the L, is, accord. to the<br>\
S, which refers, for proof, to the Kur, ch. lxxviii.<br>\
28, one of the inf. ns. of كذّب: and Ks says,<br>\
that the people of El-Yemen make the inf. n. of<br>\
فعّل of the measure فِعَّالٌ, while the other Arabs<br>\
make it تَفْعِيلٌ: TA) and, accord. to some,<br>\
كُذْبٌ and كَذْبٌ (TA: but the latter of these<br>\
two, though agreeable with analogy, is unheard:<br>\
TA): see also كَذِبٌ, below: [He lied; uttered<br>\
a falsehood; said what was untrue:] he gave an<br>\
untrue account, or relation, of a thing, whether<br>\
intentionally or unintentionally. (Msb) الكَذِبُ<br>\
is of five kinds. ―<br>\
-b2-  First, The relater&#39;s changing,<br>\
or altering, what he hears; and his relating; as<br>\
from others, what he does not know. This is the<br>\
kind that renders one criminal, and destroys manly<br>\
virtue. — Second, The saying what resembles a<br>\
lie, not meaning anything but the truth. Such<br>\
is meant in the trad., كَذَبَ إِبْرٰهِيمُ ثَلَاثَ كَذِبَاتٍ<br>\
Abraham said three sayings resembling lies;<br>\
he being veracious in the three. — Third, The<br>\
saying what is untrue by mistake, or unintentionally; making a mistake; erring. This signification is frequent. — Fourth, The finding one&#39;s<br>\
hopes false, or vain. — Fifth, The act of instigating,<br>\
or inciting. (IAmb.) [See illustrations of these<br>\
and other significations below; and see more voce<br>\
صَدَقَ.] [You say] يَكْذِبُكَ مِنْ أَيْنَ جَاءَ [He will<br>\
lie to thee even as to the place whence he comes.]<br>\
(L, art. مح, and in many other places, following<br>\
the similar phrase لَا يَصْدُقُكَ أَثَرَهُ, or أَثَرُهُ.)<br>\
Lebeed says,<br>\
اِكْذِبِ النَّفْسَ إِذَا حَدَّثْتَهَا<br>\
Lie to the soul (i. e., to thy soul,) when thou talkest<br>\
to it: i. e., say not to thy soul, Thou wilt not<br>\
succeed in thine enterprise; for thy doing so will<br>\
divert thee, or hinder thee, therefrom. A proverb. (Meyd, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b3-  كُذِبَ, pass., He was<br>\
told a lie; a falsehood; or an untruth. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
Aboo-Duwád says,<br>\
كَذَبَ العَيْرُ وَإِنْ كَانَ بَرَحْ<br>\
The wild ass hath lied, although he hath passed<br>\
from right to left: [the doing which is esteemed<br>\
unlucky:] or, [agreeably with explanations of<br>\
كَذَبَ given below,] hath become languid, and<br>\
within [the sportsman&#39;s] power, or reach, &amp;c.:<br>\
or keep to the wild ass, and hunt him, &amp;c. A<br>\
proverb, applied in the case of a thing that is<br>\
hoped for, though difficult of attainment. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  كَذَبَتْ and ↓ كذّبت (tropical:)  She (a camel), being<br>\
covered by the stallion, raised her tail, and then<br>\
returned without conceiving. (En-Nadr, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
كَذَبَ is said of other things than men [and<br>\
animals]: as of lightning, [meaning (assumed tropical:)  It gave a<br>\
false promise of rain]: of a dream, an opinion,<br>\
a hope, and a desire, [meaning, in each of these<br>\
cases, (assumed tropical:)  It proved false]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  So also<br>\
كَذَبَتِ العَيْنُ (assumed tropical:)  The sense [i. e., the sight] of the<br>\
eye deceived it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  كَذَبَ الرَّأْىُ [(assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
judgment lied]; i. e., he imagined the thing contrary to its real state. (TA.) [See also صَدَقَ<br>\
ظَنِّى] ―<br>\
-b9-  كَذَبَتْكَ عَيْنُكَ (tropical:)  Thine eye showed thee<br>\
what had no reality. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  كَذَبَ لَبَنُ النَّاقَةِ,<br>\
and ↓ كذّب, (the latter mentioned in the S,)<br>\
(tropical:)  The milk of the camel passed away, or failed.<br>\
(Lh.) ―<br>\
-b11-  كَذَبَ فِى سَيْرِهِ (tropical:)  [He (a camel) became<br>\
slack, or slow, in his pace: see 2]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-<br>\
كَذَبَ الحَرُّ (tropical:)  The heat abated. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b13-  See<br>\
also 2. كَذَبَ He found his hopes to be false,<br>\
or vain. (IAmb.) اُنْظُرْ كَيْفَ كَذَبُوا عَلَى<br>\
أَنْفُسِهِمْ, [Kur vi. 24, lit., See how they lied<br>\
against themselves,] is said to signify see how<br>\
their hope hath proved false, or vain. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b14-<br>\
ظَنُّوا أَنَّهُمْ قَدْ كُذِبُوا, [Kur xii. 110,] They (the<br>\
apostles) thought that they had been disappointed<br>\
of the fulfilment of the promise made to them.<br>\
So accord. to one reading. Accord. to another<br>\
reading, the verb is ↓ كُذِّبُوا: [in which case,<br>\
the meaning of the words appears to be, “ They<br>\
knew that they had been pronounced liars ” by<br>\
the people to whom they were sent]. (TA.)<br>\
There are also two other readings; ↓ كَذَّبُوا and<br>\
كَذَبُوا: accord. to the former, the verb refers to<br>\
the people to whom the apostles were sent; and<br>\
ظنّوا means “ they knew: ” accord. to the latter,<br>\
the words mean, “ They (the people above<br>\
mentioned) thought that they (the apostles) had<br>\
broken their promise. ” (Jel.) ―<br>\
-b15-  مَا كَذَبَ الفُؤَادُ<br>\
مَا رَأَى [The mind did not belie what he<br>\
saw.] (Kur liii. 11.) ―<br>\
-b16-  كَذَبَتْهُ نَفْسُهُ [His soul<br>\
lied to him:] his soul made him to desire things,<br>\
and to conceive hopes, that could scarcely come to<br>\
pass. (K.) Hence the soul is called الكَذُوبُ.<br>\
You say in the contr. case, صَذَقَتْهُ نفسه, and<br>\
الكَذُوبُ. (TA.) See كَذُوبٌ, and art. صدق. ―<br>\
-b17-<br>\
Hence, كَذَبَ عَلَيْهِ signifies It rendered him<br>\
active, or brisk; animated him; instigated him;<br>\
incited him; (K;) as also كَذَبَهُ. (Z.) ―<br>\
-b18-  Hence,<br>\
كَذَبَ and كَذَبَكَ and كَذَبَ عَلَيْكَ have sometimes the same signification, though not always<br>\
the same government, as عَلَيْكَ, or اِلْزَمْ; Keep to;<br>\
or take to. The noun following is put in the<br>\
nom. case accord. to the dial. of El-Yemen; and<br>\
in the acc. accord. to the dial. of Mudar; or,<br>\
as some say, is correctly put in the nom. only.<br>\
(TA.) You say, كَذَبَ عَلَيْكَ كَذَا وَكَذَا, meaning Keep to, or take to, such and such things. It<br>\
is an extr. phrase. (ISk.) You also say, كَذَبْتُ<br>\
عَلَيْكَ, meaning Keep thou to me: and كذبتُ<br>\
عَلَيْكُمْ Keep ye to me. IAar. cites the following<br>\
verse of Khidásh Ibn-Zuheyr, [in which he<br>\
tauntingly compares a people to ticks]:<br>\
كَذَبْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ أَوْ عِدُونِى وَعَلِّلُوا<br>\
بِىَ الأَرْضَ وَالأَقْوَامَ قِرْدَانَ مَوْظَبَا<br>\
[Keep ye to me: threaten me, and soothe by (the<br>\
mention of) me the land and the peoples, O ticks<br>\
of Mowdhab!]: meaning Keep ye to me, and to<br>\
satirizing me, when ye are on a journey, and<br>\
traverse the land mentioning me. (TA.) In<br>\
like manner, يَوْمُ الأَحَدِ والخَمِيسِ كَذَبَاكَ أَوْ يَوْمُ<br>\
الإِثْنَيْنِ والثَّلَاثَاءِ, in a trad. respecting the proper<br>\
days for being cupped, signifies Keep thou to<br>\
Sunday and Thursday, or Monday and Tuesday.<br>\
(IAth, Z.) The verb is thus used after the<br>\
manner of a proverb, and is invariable [as to<br>\
tense], being constantly in the pret. tense, connected [literally or virtually, when explained by<br>\
عَلَيْكَ followed by the prep. ب, or by إِلْزَمْ,] only<br>\
with the person addressed, and in the sense of<br>\
the imperative. كذباك here [lit.] signifies Let<br>\
them render thee active, or brisk, and animate<br>\
thee, instigate thee, or incite thee. (Z.). [A trad.<br>\
of &#39;Omar, quoted below, presents another instance to which this signification is said to<br>\
apply.] ―<br>\
-b19-  Or كَذَبَ denotes instigation, or incitement, of the person addressed, to keep to the<br>\
thing that is mentioned; as in the saying of the<br>\
Arabs, كَذَبَ عَلَيْكَ العَسَلُ, meaning Eat thou<br>\
honey: but the explanation of this is, (The relinquisher of) honey hath erred [to thee; i. e., in<br>\
his representation of its evil qualites &amp;c.; which<br>\
is equivalent to saying, Eat, or keep to, honey]:<br>\
العَسَلُ being put for تَارِكُ العَسَلِ. [See also 1 in<br>\
art. عسل.] In like manner, the saying of &#39;Omar,<br>\
كَذَبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الحَجُّ &amp;c., (see below,) signifies<br>\
Keep ye to the performance of the pilgrimage,<br>\
&amp;c.: [or (the relinquisher of) the pilgrimage hath<br>\
erred to thee in his representation of it: therefore<br>\
it means as above]. (IAmb.) Accord. to IAmb<br>\
the noun signifying the object of instigation<br>\
[which may also be called the cause thereof] cannot be rightly put in the acc. case: if so put, the<br>\
verb is without an agent. (TA.) [But see what<br>\
is said on this point in the remarks on the trad.<br>\
of &#39;Omar below.] ―<br>\
-b20-  Or the verb in a case of this<br>\
kind signifies أَمْكَنَ: thus, كَذَبَكَ الحَجُّ signifies<br>\
The performance of the pilgrimage is possible, or<br>\
practicable, to thee: therefore [it means] Perform thou the pilgrimage. (ISh.) ―<br>\
-b21-  Or أَمْكَنَ<br>\
is its original signification; and the meaning<br>\
intended is Keep to; as in the ex. كَذَبَ العَتِيقُ.<br>\
(Aal.) ―<br>\
-b22-  &#39;Antarah, addressing his wife &#39;Ableh,<br>\
says; or, accord. to some, the poet is Khuzaz<br>\
Ibn-Lowdhán;<br>\
كَذَبَ العَتِيقُ وَمَآءُ شَنٍّ بَارِدٌ<br>\
إِنْ كُنْتِ سَائِلَتِى غَبُوقًا فَا@ذْهَبِى<br>\
(TA.) i. e., Keep thou to the eating of dates, and<br>\
to the cool water of an old, worn-out, skin: if<br>\
thou ask me for an evening&#39;s drink of milk,<br>\
depart: for I have appropriated the milk to my<br>\
colt, which is profitable to me, and may preserve<br>\
me and thee: (L:) العتيق is in the nom. case<br>\
accord. to the dial. of El-Yemen: but in the acc.<br>\
accord. to that of Mudar. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b23-  Er-Radee<br>\
[reading العتيقَ] cites this verse as a proof that<br>\
كَذَبَ, originally a verb, has become a verbal<br>\
noun, signifying اِلْزَمْ. (TA.) But he is the only<br>\
one who asserts it to be a verbal noun. (MF.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b24-  Also, Mo&#39;akkir El-Bárikee says,<br>\
وَذُبْيَانِيَّةٍ أُوْصَتْ بَنِيهَا<br>\
بِأَنْ كَذَبَ القَرَاطِفُ وَالقُرُوفُ<br>\
And many a woman of Dhubyán charged her<br>\
sons by [saying], Keep to the red garments<br>\
(اكسية), and the bags (or receptacles) of leather<br>\
tanned with pomegranate-bark. She charged<br>\
them to take plenty of these two things as spoil<br>\
from the tribe of Nemir, if they should prevail over them. (Aboo-&#39;Obeyd El-Kásim Ibn-Selám.) ―<br>\
-b25-  كذب is also said to have the same<br>\
meaning in the words of the trad. كَذَبَ النَّسَّابُونَ<br>\
[Keep to those skilled in genealogy:] or Regard<br>\
is to be had to what is said by those skilled in<br>\
genealogy: another meaning to which is assigned<br>\
below. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b26-  It sometimes signifies It is<br>\
incumbent, or obligatory. So in the following:<br>\
(a trad. of &#39;Omar: TA:) كَذَبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الحَجُّ<br>\
كَذَبَ عَلَيْكُمُ العُمْرَةُ كَذَبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الجِهَادُ ثلَاثَةُ<br>\
أَسْفَارٍ كَذَبْنَ عَلَيْكُمْ [The performance of the pilgrimage is incumbent on you: the performance of<br>\
(the rites called) العمرة is incumbent on you:<br>\
warring (for the sake of religion) is incumbent<br>\
on you: three expeditions are incumbent on you]:<br>\
(S, * K:) or كذب, here, is from كَذَبَتْهُ نَفْسُهُ,<br>\
“ his soul made him to desire things, and to conceive hopes, that could scarcely come to pass; ”<br>\
and the meaning is let [the expectation of the<br>\
reward which will follow] the performance of the<br>\
pilgrimage render thee active, or brisk, and<br>\
animate thee, instigate thee, or incite thee, to the<br>\
act: [and so of the rest of the trad.: but here I<br>\
should observe, that, for لِيَكْذِبَكَ and لِيُنَشِّطَكَ and<br>\
يَبْعَثَكَ, in the CK, we should read لِيَكْذِبْكَ &amp;c.:]<br>\
(K:) ―<br>\
-b27-  or, as ISk says, كذب, here, seems to<br>\
denote instigation, or incitement, meaning عَلَيْكُمْ<br>\
بِهِ keep ye to it; and is an extr. word with<br>\
respect to analogy: (S:) ―<br>\
-b28-  accord. to Akh.,<br>\
الحجّ is governed in the nom. case by كذب;<br>\
but as to the meaning, it is in the acc.; because<br>\
the meaning is a command to perform the pilgrimage; as when you say, أَمْكَنَكَ الصَّيْدُ [“ the<br>\
game hath become within thy power, or reach ”],<br>\
meaning “ shoot it, ” or “ cast at it: ” (S:) he<br>\
who puts الحجّ in the acc. case, [agreeably with<br>\
one relation of the trad., TA,] makes عليك [or<br>\
عليكم] a verbal noun; and in كذب is [implied]<br>\
the pronoun which refers to الحجّ [and which is<br>\
the agent of the verb]; (K;) or the agent is<br>\
implied in كذب, and explained by what follows<br>\
it; (Sb;) [so that] the meaning is كَذَبَ الحَجُّ<br>\
عَلَيْكُمُ الحَجَّ: (Z:) or, [as shown above,] كذب<br>\
is a verbal n., meaning الْزَمْ, and الحجّ is in the<br>\
acc. case as governed by it: (Er-Radee:) though<br>\
its being in the acc. case, accord. to some, is<br>\
altogether unknown: (TA:) ―<br>\
-b29-  [or the meaning<br>\
is as stated before on the authority of ISh.:] ―<br>\
-b30-<br>\
or the trad. means كَذَبَ عَلَيْكَ الحَجُّ إِنْ ذُكِرَ<br>\
أَنَّهُ غَيْرُ كَافٍ هَادِمٍ لِمَا قَبْلَهُ مِنَ الذُّنُوبِ [(the relinguisher of) the pilgrimage hath erred to thee if<br>\
it have been spoken of (by him) as not sufficient,<br>\
(and as not) abolishing the sins, or offences,<br>\
(committed) before it: agreeably with the explanation by IAmb, given above]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b31-<br>\
كَذَبَ He said what was false unintentionally;<br>\
committed a mistake, or error. The verb is used<br>\
in this sense by the people of El-Hijáz, and the<br>\
rest of the Arabs have followed them in so using<br>\
it. (Towsheeh.)<br>\
-A2-  كَذَبَ is also said to signify<br>\
He spoke truth; so as to bear two contr. meanings: and thus, كَذَبَ النَّسَّابُونَ may signify<br>\
Those skilled in genealogy have spoken truth:<br>\
but another explanation of this saying is given<br>\
in this art. (MF, &amp;c.)<br>\
-A3-  كَذَبَتْ عَفَّاقَتُكَ [and<br>\
the like] Thou brokest wind. (S in art. عفق.)<br>\
2<br>\
كذّبه, inf. n. تَكْذِيبٌ, (and كِذَّابٌ, TA,<br>\
and تَكْذِبَةٌ [like تَجْرِبَةٌ &amp;c.], occurring in the TA,<br>\
voce لَهَبَةٌ, &amp;c.) He made, or pronounced, him a<br>\
liar; an utterer of falsehood; or a sayer of<br>\
what was untrue: (K:) he attributed, or ascribed, to him lying, untruth, mendacity, or the<br>\
speaking untruth: (Msb:) and (Msb) [accused<br>\
him of lying:] he gave him the lie; said to him,<br>\
“ Thou hast lied, ” &amp;c. (S, Msb.) See also 4.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  كذّب بِالأَمْرِ, inf. n. تَكْذِيبٌ and كِذَّابٌ (K:<br>\
the latter inf. n. of the dial. of El-Yemen: Ks,<br>\
Fr) and كِذَابٌ, (TA,) He rejected, disallowed,<br>\
denied, disacknowledged, disbelieved in, or discredited, the thing; syn. أَنْكَرَهُ; (K;) as also<br>\
كذّبهُ, and ↓ كَذَبَهُ. (Jel, liii. 11.) Ex. وَكَذَّبُوا<br>\
بِآيَاتِنَا كِذَّابًا [And they rejected our signs, with<br>\
rejection: Kur, lxxviii. 28]. (S.) And كَذَّبَ<br>\
الفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى, and ↓ كَذَبَ: see art. فأد, and<br>\
see 1. ―<br>\
-b3-  كذّب عَنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  He repelled from him, [or<br>\
defended him]; syn. رَدَّ عَنْهُ; namely, a man.<br>\
(K.) [See exs. voce عوّى, in art. عو.]<br>\
-A2-  حَمَلَ<br>\
فَمَا كَذّب, inf. n. تَكْذِيبٌ, (tropical:)  He charged, and was<br>\
not cowardly, (S, K,) and did not retreat. (TA.)<br>\
حَمَلَ ثُمَّ كذّب He charge, and then was<br>\
cowardly, or did not charge with earnestness, or<br>\
sincerity: (S:) ―<br>\
-b2-  or falsified the opinion formed<br>\
of him: or made a false charge. (A.) كذّب<br>\
عَنَ قِرْنِهِ He charged, and then retreated from<br>\
his adversary. (Sh.) كذّب القِتَالَ He was<br>\
cowardly in fight. التَّكْذِيبُ in fighting is the<br>\
contr. of الصِّدْقُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  كذّب السَّيْرَ [He<br>\
slackened his pace, or became slow, after giving<br>\
promise of being quick;] he did not proceed in his<br>\
journey with energy. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  مَا كَذَّبَ أَنْ فَعَلَ<br>\
كَذَا (so in the TA, and in a MS. copy of the K:<br>\
in the CK, and in two copies of the S, مَا كَذَبَ:)<br>\
(tropical:)  He did not delay to do so: (S, K:) he was not<br>\
cowardly and weak, and did not delay to do so.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  كذّب عَنْ أَمْرٍ قَدْ أَرَادَهُ (tropical:)  He abstained,<br>\
or desisted, or drew back by reason of fear, from<br>\
a thing that he had desired to do. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  كذّب<br>\
(and ↓ كَذَبَ, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He (a wild beast) took a<br>\
run, and then stopped to see what was behind<br>\
him, (K,) whether he were pursued or not.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
كَاذَبْتُهُ, inf. n. مُكَاذَبَةٌ and كِذَابٌ, I lied,<br>\
&amp;c., to him, and he to me. (K, * TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اكذبهُ He found him a liar; an utterer of<br>\
falsehood; or a sayer of what was untrue: (S,<br>\
K:) or he said to him, “ Thou hast lied ”: &amp;c.:<br>\
(TA:) or this verb bears the former of these two<br>\
significations, and ↓ كذّبه signifies the latter:<br>\
(S:) or اكذبه signifies he shewed him that he<br>\
had told a lie, &amp;c.: (Zj:) or اكذبه signifies<br>\
he announced that he had told, or related, a lie,<br>\
&amp;c.: and ↓ كذّبه, he announced his being a liar,<br>\
&amp;c.: (Ks, S:) or اكذبه and ↓ كذّبه are syn.:<br>\
but the former sometimes signifies he incited,<br>\
urged, or induced, him to lie, &amp;c. (a signification<br>\
assigned to it in the K): and sometimes, he made<br>\
manifest, or proved, his lying, &amp;c. (a signification<br>\
also assigned to it in the K): and he found him<br>\
a liar, &amp;c. (Th, S, * TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اكذب, inf. n.<br>\
إِكْذَابٌ, (tropical:)  He, being called to, or shouted to,<br>\
remained silent, feigning to be asleep. (AA, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تكدّب He affected lying: or he lied purposely (تَكَلَّفَ الكَذِبَ). (S, K.) He told a lie;<br>\
[like كَذَب.] (MA, KL.) [See also an instance<br>\
in which it is trans., meaning He spoke falsely,<br>\
voce تزعّم.] ―<br>\
-b2-  تكذّبهُ, (K,) and تكذّب عَلَيْهِ, (TA,)<br>\
He asserted that he was a liar. (K.) Aboo-Bekr Es-Siddeek says,<br>\
رَسُولٌ أَتَاهُمْ صَادِقًا فَتَكَذَّبُوا<br>\
عَلَيْهِ وَقَالُوا لَسْتَ فِينَا بِمَا كِثِ<br>\
[An apostle came to them, speaking truth; but<br>\
they brought a charge of lying against him,<br>\
or asserted him to be a liar, and said, Thou shalt<br>\
not stay among us]. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تكاذبوا They lied, &amp;c., one to another. (S.)<br>\
See also تَصَادَقَا.<br>\
كَذْبٌ and كَذِبٌ and كَذَبٌ and كُذْبٌ i. q.<br>\
كَدْبٌ &amp;c. (K, art. كدب.)<br>\
كَذِبٌ and ↓ أُكْذُوبَةٌ [pl. أَكَاذِيبُ] (S, K) and<br>\
↓ كُذْبَى and ↓ مَكْذُوبٌ (K: this last a pass.<br>\
part. n. used in the sense of an inf. n., as is said<br>\
to be done in only four other instances: MF)<br>\
and ↓ مَكْذُوبَةٌ (S, K: a fem. pass. part. n. which<br>\
is less used in this manner than a masc.: TA<br>\
[or perhaps an inf. n., as its contr. مَصْدُوقَةٌ is<br>\
said to be:]) and ↓ مَكْذَبَةٌ (K: a meemee inf. n.<br>\
agreeable with analogy: TA) and ↓ مُكْذُبَةٌ (CK:<br>\
omitted in a MS. copy, and in the TA) and<br>\
↓ كَاذِبَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ كُذْبَانٌ and ↓ كُذَّابٌ (K)<br>\
and ↓ تَكْذَابٌ (L, art. مسح,) are synonymous:<br>\
(S, K) [all of these are regarded by some as<br>\
inf. ns., signifying The act of lying; uttering a<br>\
falsehood; or saying what is untrue: by others,<br>\
all but the first seem to be regarded as simple<br>\
substantives, signifying a lie; a falsehood; an<br>\
untruth; a fiction; a fable: and the first, being<br>\
