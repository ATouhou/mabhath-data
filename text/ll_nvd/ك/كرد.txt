Efendee El-Kurdee:) or their ancestor was Kurd<br>\
the son of &#39;Amr the son of &#39;Ámir the son of<br>\
Saasa&#39;ah: (Abu-l-Yakdhán:) El-Mes&#39;oodee says,<br>\

Rabee&#39;ah the son of Nizár: others, that they are<br>\
of the descendants of Mudar the son of Nizár:<br>\
others, that they are descended from Kurd the<br>\
son of Ken&#39;án the son of Koosh the son of Hám:<br>\
and he adds, that they are apparently of the<br>\
offspring of Hám, like the Persians: that among<br>\
the known tribes of which they consist are the<br>\
سورانيّة, the كورانية, the عمادية, the حكارية, the<br>\
محمودية, the بختية, the بشوية, the جوبية, the<br>\
زرزائية, the مهرانية, the جاودانية, the رضائية, the<br>\

Ádharbeeján, and Irbil, and El-Mósil. (Mo-<br>\
