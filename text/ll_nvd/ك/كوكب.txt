He abstained from the thing through timidity:<br>\
(TA:) or he dreaded the thing, and abstained<br>\
from it through cowardice: (S, K, TA:) or<br>\
his eye reverted from the thing, and he desired it<br>\
not. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  كَاءَ عَنْهُ He retired from him<br>\
through fear. (TA.) [Accord. to the TA, it<br>\

اكاءه, inf. n. إِكَآءٌ and إِكَآءَةٌ, He came upon<br>\
him suddenly, when he (the latter) was about to<br>\
do a thing, and caused him to abstain from it<br>\
through fear or cowardice. (K, TA.) But<br>\

inf. n. كِتَابٌ and كِتَابَةٌ. (TA, art. أَكأ.) ―<br>\
