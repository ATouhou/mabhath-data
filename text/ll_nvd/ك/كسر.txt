is pl. of مَكْسُورٌ:] Abu-l-Hasan says, that Sb<br>\

عِنْدَ ا@مْرَأَةٍ مُغْزِيَةٍ, meaning, (tropical:)  Not one of them<br>\

جَمْعُ التَّكْسِيرِ (assumed tropical:)  [The broken plural;] the plural<br>\

changed; (K;) the change being either apparent,<br>\
as in رِجَالٌ, pl. of رَجُلٌ, or understood, as in فُلْكٌ,<br>\
which is both sing. and pl., for the dammeh in<br>\
the sing. in this case is like the dammeh of<br>\
قُفْلٌ, and that in the pl. is like that of أسْدٌ. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Akeel: see Dieterici&#39;s “ Alfijjah ” &amp;c.; pp.<br>\

تَكْسِيرٌ [or area], which [last] is the product<br>\
of the multiplication of the half of the قطر<br>\
by the half of the دور: and it is sometimes called مِسَاحَةٌ. You say, مَا تَكْسِيرُ دَائِرَةٍ<br>\
قُطْرُهَا سَبْعَةٌ وَدَوْرُهَا ا@ثْنَانِ وَعِشْرُونَ [What is the<br>\

answer is ثَمَانِيَةٌ وَثَلَاثُونَ وَنِصْفٌ [Eight-and-thirty<br>\

add that this is not perfectly exact.]<br>\
مَكْسِرٌ A place of breaking, (K, TA,) of anything. (TA.) You say, عُودٌ صُلْبُ المَكْسِرِ [Wood,<br>\

طَيِّبُ المَكْسِرِ [Wood, &amp;c., good in the place of<br>\

صُلْبُ المَكْسِرِ (A, L) (tropical:)  A man who bears up<br>\
against difficulty, distress, or adversity: because<br>\
one breaks a piece of wood, to try if it be hard<br>\

a one is easy, or compliant, when asked], which is<br>\
an expression of praise when it means [lit.] that<br>\
he is not one whose wood gives only a sound<br>\
when one endeavours to produce fire from it; and<br>\
of dispraise when it means [lit.] that be is one<br>\
whose wood is weak. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ طَيِّبُ<br>\
المَكْسِرِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is praised when tried, proved,<br>\
or tested: (S, TA:) and رَدِىْءُ المَكْسِرِ [dispraised<br>\

that] مَكْسِرٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The internal state; an<br>\

lowest part (أَصْلٌ K, TA) of anything; and<br>\

broken off. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence] it is said to be<br>\
metonymically used as meaning (tropical:)  Old property.<br>\
(TA voce فَرْعٌ.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also كَسْرٌ.<br>\
مَكْسُورٌ: see كَسِيرٌ. ―<br>\

(TA.)<br>\
فُلَانٌ مُكَاسِرِى, (S,) or جَارِى مُكَاسِرِى, (ISd,<br>\
K,) Such a one is my neighbour; (S;) the<br>\
كِسْر (q. v.) of his tent is next the كِسْر of my<br>\
tent. (S, ISd, K.)<br>\
مُنْكَسِرٌ has for its pl. مَكَاسِيرُ, which is extr.;<br>\
