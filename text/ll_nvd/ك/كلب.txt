كَلْبٌ a word of well-known signification,<br>\
[The dog:] (S:) or any wounding animal of<br>\
prey: (L, K, &amp;c.:) but whether birds [of prey]<br>\
are comprised in this term is a point that requires<br>\
consideration: (Esh-Shiháb El-Khafájee:) and<br>\
especially applied to the barking animal [or<br>\
dog]: (K:) or rather, this is its proper signification; and it admits no other: (MF:)<br>\

dogs: (K:) [both are quasi-pl. ns. in my opinion,<br>\
though the former is called a pl. in the S:]<br>\
accord. to some, the former, if masc., is a quasipl. n. ; and if fem., a pl.: (MF:) the latter is<br>\
like جَامِلٌ and بَاقِرٌ [which are both quasi-pl. ns.].<br>\
(L.) The pl. of كَلْبَةٌ [the fem.] is كِلَابٌ and<br>\
كَلَبَاتٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  فُلَانٌ بِوَادِى الكَلْبِ (tropical:)  [Such a<br>\
one is in the valley of the dog:] said of one whom<br>\
no one cares for, and who has no place of abode<br>\
or resort, but is like a dog, which one sees ever<br>\
going forth into the desert. ―<br>\
-b3-  كَفَّ عَنْهُ كِلَابَهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  He left reviling him, and injuring or annoying<br>\
him: [lit., restrained from him his dogs]. (A.)<br>\
See also كَلَبٌ. ―<br>\

the first word being in the nom. case as an<br>\
inchoative, (TA,) and الكِلَابَ, (S, K,) put in<br>\
the acc. case as governed by a verb understood,<br>\
(TA,) or الكِرَابُ and الكِرَابَ; (Kh, S, art. كرب,<br>\
K;) of which readings, that of الكلاب is the<br>\
one generally adopted; (TA;) or they are two<br>\
distinct proverbs, each having its proper meaning;<br>\
(Meyd;) the former signifying, [if we read<br>\
الكِلَابَ,] Send the dogs against the wild oxen:<br>\
i. e., leave a man and his art: (S, K:) [but<br>\
accord. to MF, this is the meaning if we read<br>\
كراب; but if we read كلاب, the signification<br>\
is, as explained above, “ Send the dogs &amp;c., ”<br>\
and the proverb is applied on the occasion of<br>\
instigating one set of people against another set,<br>\
without caring for what may happen to them:]<br>\
or it alludes to a man&#39;s having little care or<br>\
solicitude for the state, or case, or affair, of his<br>\
companion. (A &#39;Obeyd.) If we read الكلابُ,<br>\
the meaning is The dogs are upon, or against,<br>\
the wild oxen: and in like manner, if we read<br>\
الكرابُ, the meaning is “ The turning over of the<br>\
soil is the work of the oxen: ” if الكرابَ,<br>\
“ Leave the turning over of the soil to the oxen. ”<br>\
(MF, from expositions of the Fs.) ―<br>\

[app., from their longitudes, the same two stars<br>\
to which the above quotation from the TA<br>\

to two other stars.] ―<br>\
-b4-  كلب الرعى is [likewise]<br>\
a name given to The star which is on, or in, the<br>\
head of Hercules; [for الحاوى, an evident<br>\
mistake in my MS. of El-Kazweenee, I read<br>\
الجَاثِى;] that in the head of Ophiuchus (الحَوَّاءُ)<br>\
being called الراعى. (El-Kazweenee.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [الكَلْبَانِ,<br>\
accord. to Freytag, A name of the two stars<br>\
υ<br>\
and<br>\
� degrees which belong to Taurus: but accord. to<br>\

called because they set aurorally in the winter:<br>\

disorder] resembling madness, or diobolical possession: (S:) a disease that befalls a man from<br>\
the bite of a mad dog, occasioning what resembles<br>\
madness, or diabolical possession, so that whomsoever he bites, that person also becomes in like<br>\
manner affected, abstaining from drinking water<br>\
until he dies of thirst: the Arabs concur in the<br>\
assertion that its cure is a drop of the blood of<br>\
a king, mixed with water, and given to the<br>\
patient to drink. (TA.) Accord. to El-Mufaddal,<br>\
it originates from a disease which befalls the<br>\
standing corn &amp;c., and which is not removed<br>\
until the sun rises upon it: if cattle eat of it<br>\
before that, they die: wherefore Mohammad<br>\
forbade pasturing by night: but sometimes a<br>\
camel runs away, and eats of such pasture before<br>\
sunrise, and dies in consequence: then a dog<br>\
comes, and eats of its flesh, and becomes mad;<br>\
and if it bite a man, he also becomes mad, and<br>\
when he hears the barking of a dog, answers it<br>\
[by barking]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  دِمَاءُ المُلُوكِ أَشْفَى مِنَ<br>\
الكَلَبِ [The blood of kings has cured of canine<br>\
madness]: or, accord. to another reading, دِمَاءُ<br>\
المُلُوكِ شِفَاءُ الكَلَبِ [The blood of kings is the cure<br>\
for canine madness]. A proverb, explained by<br>\
what is quoted from Lh, voce كَلِبٌ. But<br>\
some reject this explanation, and assert the<br>\
meaning to be, that, when a man is enraged [by<br>\
desire of obtaining revenge], and takes his blood<br>\
revenge, the blood is the cure of his rage,<br>\
though not really drunk. (TA.) See also<br>\
كَلِبٌ and كَلِبَ. ―<br>\
-b4-  [Also كَلَبٌ A madness<br>\

with what resembles madness, or diabolical possession, so that when it wounds a man, he also<br>\
becomes in like manner affected (Lth. S) by the<br>\
disease called كُلَابٌ, barking like a dog, reading<br>\
his clothes upon himself. wounding others, and at<br>\
last dying of thirst, refusing to drink. (Lth.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  A man thus affected is termed كَلِبٌ and<br>\
↓ كَلِيبٌ: pl. of the former كَلِبُونَ, and of the<br>\
latter (or of the former accord. to the S) كَلْبَى.<br>\
(TA.) When a man thus affected bites another,<br>\
they come to a man of noble rank, and he drops<br>\
for them some blood from his finger, which they<br>\
give to drink to the patient, and he becomes<br>\
cured. (Lh.) See also كَلَبٌ and كَلِبَ. ―<br>\

حَدِيدَةٌ ذَاتُ كَلْبَتَيْنِ [An iron with two curved<br>\

-A3-  A thong, or a strand (طَاقَة)<br>\
of the fibres of the palm-tree (لِيف), with which<br>\
skins and the like are sewed: (K, TA:) [see<br>\
إِقْتَفَأَ:] or a thong, or [so in the O and in the<br>\
TA, art. قفأ; but here, in the latter, instead of<br>\
“ or, ” “ behind, ” which is evidently a mistake;]<br>\
a strand (طَاقَة) of the fibres of the palm-tree,<br>\
used in the same manner as the shoe-maker&#39;s awl<br>\
that has, at its head, a perforation ثَقْبٌ [so in<br>\
the O, in the TA حجر a strange mistranscription: what is meant is doubtless an eye,<br>\
like that of a needle, and it is by means of an<br>\
implement with an eye at the end that the<br>\
operation here described is commonly performed<br>\
in the present day:] the thong, or the thread,<br>\
or string, is inserted into the كلبة, which is<br>\
doubled: thus it enters the place [or hole] of<br>\
the sewing, and the sewer introduces his hand<br>\
into the إِدَاوَة [q.v., i. e., the vessel upon which<br>\
he is employed in working], and stretches the<br>\
thong of leather, or the thread, or string, (O, L,<br>\
TA,) in the كلبة. (L, TA.) [See كَلَبَ.]<br>\

who trains the فَهْد, and birds of prey, to take<br>\
game: see Kur v. 6: one who possesses dogs<br>\
trained to hunt, and hunts with them; (L;)<br>\
