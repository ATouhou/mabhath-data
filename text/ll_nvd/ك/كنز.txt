كَنَازٌ and ↓ كِنَازٌ: see كَنَزَ التَّمْرَ. [Accord. to<br>\
Az, they are inf. ns.; but some seem to regard<br>\
them as simple substs.] You say, هٰذَا زَمَنُ الكَنَازِ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K. *) and ↓ الكِنَازِ, (K,) This is the time of<br>\

abundant, كَثِيرَة, TA,) in flesh, (S, K,) and hard,<br>\
or firm: (K:) pl. كُنْزٌ and كِنَازٌ; the latter being<br>\
like the sing.; (K;) but the two vowels [namely<br>\
the two kesrehs] and the two alifs are regarded<br>\
as different; for the word is not, as some assert,<br>\
of the same class as جُنُبٌ, since it has a dual<br>\
form, namely كِنَازَانِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  كِتَابٌ مُكْتَنِزٌ<br>\
بِالفَوَائِدِ (tropical:)  [A book, or writing, stored with useful<br>\
things]. (A, TA.)<br>\
