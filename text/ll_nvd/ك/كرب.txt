-b3- . (TA.) This is one of the verbs<br>\
to which one does not give as its enunciative the<br>\
act. part. n. of the verb which is its proper<br>\
enunciative: [so that] you do not say, كَرَبَ<br>\
كَائِنًا: [in which كَرَبَ implies the pron. هُوَ,<br>\

shackle, or shackles, (S, K, TA,) upon the<br>\

أَزْجُرْ حِمَارَكَ لَا يَرْتَعْ بِرَوْضَتِنَا<br>\
إِذًا يُرَدَّ وَقَيْدُ العَيْرِ مَكْرُوبُ<br>\
[Check thine ass: let him not pasture at large<br>\

3<br>\
كاربه i. q. قاربه, He, or it, approached, or<br>\

[after the racemes of fruit had been cut off]; and<br>\

the roots of the branches of the palm-tree, as also<br>\

كَرْبٌ [an inf. n. of 1, q. v.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [You say]<br>\
هٰذَهِ إِبِلٌ مِائَةٌ أَوْ كَرْبُهَا (this is the right reading;<br>\
and some say that ↓ كُرْبُهَا is correct: TA: [the<br>\
latter is the reading in the CK:]) There are a<br>\
hundred camels, or about that number; or<br>\
nearly so. (K.) كرب is syn. with قُرْبٌ. (L.)<br>\

and so accord. to some copies of the K, [agreeably with present usage, see بَهْرٌ, last sentence:])<br>\
or the soul: (so [erroneously] accord. to some<br>\
copies of the K) or anxiety, solicitude, or disquietude of the mind: (Msb:) [or grief, or<br>\
anxiety, that presses heavily upon the heart:] or<br>\
both signify anxiety, grief, or intense grief:<br>\
(MA:) pl. of the former كُرُوبٌ, (K,) and of the<br>\
latter كُرَبٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
كُرْبٌ: see كَرْبٌ.<br>\
كَرَبٌ The rope that is tied to the bucket after<br>\
the مَنِين, which is the first [or main] rope, so<br>\
that it (the كرب) remains if the منين break: or<br>\
the rope that is tied to the middle of the cross-bars<br>\
of the bucket, (and is then doubled, and then<br>\
trebled, S,) so as to be that which is next the<br>\
water, in order that the great rope may not rot:<br>\
(S, K:) but in a marginal note in a copy of the<br>\
S, it is said that this latter explanation properly<br>\
applies to the دَرَك; not to the كرب: (IM:) pl.<br>\
أَكْرَابٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  كَرَبٌ [coll. gen. n.] The<br>\
lower parts, or ends, of palm-branches, (S, K,)<br>\
which are thick and broad, (K,) like shoulderblades: (S:) or the stumps of the branches, or<br>\
what remain upon the palm-tree, of the lower<br>\
parts, or ends, of the branches, after the lopping,<br>\
like steps: n. un. with ة. (TA.) Hence the<br>\
proverb,<br>\
مَتَى كَانَ حُكْمُ اللّٰهِ فِى كَرَبِ النَّخْلِ<br>\
[When was the wisdom of God in the stumps, or<br>\
lower ends, of palm-branches?] (S.) Said by<br>\
Jereer, in reply to Es-Salatán El-&#39;Abdee, who<br>\
had pronounced El-Ferezdak superior to Jereer<br>\
in point of lineage, and Jereer superior to ElFerezdak as a poet. IB denies it to be a proverb; but IM contends against him that it is,<br>\
[The meaning is, When was God&#39;s wisdom in<br>\
husbandmen, and possessors of palm-trees? for<br>\
the region of Es-Salatán&#39;s tribe abounded in<br>\
palm-trees. The words are applied to a man<br>\
who provokes another to a contest for excellence,<br>\
being unworthy of the contest. See Freytag,<br>\
Arab. Prov., ii. 628.]<br>\
كُرْبَةٌ: see كَرْبٌ.<br>\
كَرَبَةٌ sing. of كِرَابٌ, which latter signifies The<br>\
channels in which water flows (S) in a valley:<br>\
(K:) or the upper parts (صُدُور) of valleys.<br>\
(AA.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb says, describing bees,<br>\
جَوَارِسُهَا تَأْوِى الشُّعُوفَ دَوَائِبًا<br>\
وَتَنْصَبُّ أَلْهَابًا مَصِيفًا كِرَابُهَا<br>\
[The eaters, or feeders, among them, resort to the<br>\
upper parts of the mountains, busily engaged, and<br>\
pour down (into) ravines with crooked water-channels]. (S.) [جوارس, شعوف, and مصيف,<br>\
are explained as above in the TA: and الهاب is<br>\
said in the S and TA, art. لهب, to be here pl. of<br>\
لِهْبٌ. In a copy of the S, this last is erroneously<br>\
written إِلْهَابًا.]<br>\
-A2-  كَرَبَةٌ (in the TA, written<br>\
كَرَبٌ,) The piece of wood (زِرّ) in which is inserted<br>\
the head of a tent-pole. (K.)<br>\
كَرْبَانُ A vessel nearly full: (S:) fem. كَرْبَاءُ;<br>\
pl. كَرْبَى and كِرَابٌ. (TA.) Yaakoob asserts,<br>\
that the ك in this word is a substitute for the ق<br>\
in قَرْبَانُ; but ISd denies this. (TA.)<br>\
كرابُ إِنَاءٍ [app. كِرَاب or كُرَاب] What is less<br>\
than جُمَامُ إِنَاوِ; [i. e., what is nearly equal to the<br>\
full, or piled-up, contents, or measure, of a vessel].<br>\
(TA.) See قِرَابٌ.<br>\
الكِرَابُ عَلَى البَقَرِ [The turning over of the soil is<br>\
the work of the oxen]: a proverb. (S, K.)<br>\
See art. كِلب: [where other readings, namely<br>\
الكِرَابَ and الكِلَابَ and الكِلَابُ, are mentioned].<br>\
(K.)<br>\
كَرِيبٌ i. q. قَرَاحٌ [Land which has neither<br>\
water nor trees: or land that is cleared for<br>\
sowing and planting: pl., app., كِرَابٌ: see an<br>\
ex. near the end of the first paragraph of art.<br>\
ختم:] (K:) and جَادِسٌ [land that is not<br>\
cultivated nor ploughed], that has never been<br>\
sowed. (TA.) See also جَرِيبٌ.<br>\
-A2-  A wooden<br>\
implement of a baker, or maker of bread, with<br>\
which he forms the cakes of bread (يُرَغِّفُ). (K.)<br>\
[In the TA is added “ in the oven ”: but I doubt<br>\
the propriety of this addition.]<br>\
-A3-  A knot, or<br>\
joint, (كَعْبٌ), of a reed or cane. (K.)<br>\
-A4-<br>\
Accord. to IAar, i. q. شُوبَقٌ, which is the same<br>\
as فَيْلَكُونٌ. [شوبق is an arabicised word, from<br>\
the Persian شُوبَجْ, or چُوبَهْ, both of which<br>\
signify a rolling-pin, and this meaning is given<br>\
to شوبق and شوبك in the present day. It should<br>\
be remarked, however, that كَرْنِيب (with ن),<br>\
which is probably a corruption of كَرِيبٌ, is a<br>\
name often given in Egypt, in the present day,<br>\
to a baker&#39;s peel.] In the L, كريب is explained,<br>\
as on the authority of Kr, by سَوِيقٌ; but this is<br>\
probably a mistake for شوبق. (TA.) See مَكْرُوبٌ.<br>\
كَرَابَةٌ: see كُرَابَةٌ<br>\
كُرَابَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ كَرَابَةٌ (K), but the former<br>\
is the more approved word, (TA,) Dates that<br>\
are picked from among the roots of the branches<br>\
(S, K) after the racemes of fruit have been cut<br>\
off: (S:) the scattered dates that remain at the<br>\
roots of the branches: (AHn, TA voce خُلَالَةٌ,<br>\
which signifies the same:) pl. أَكْرِبَةٌ, in the<br>\
formation of which, the augmentative letter<br>\
(meaning the fem. ة, TA,) seems to have been<br>\
rejected [or disregarded]; for فُعَالَةٌ (this is the<br>\
right reading; TA; but in some copies of the K<br>\
we read فُعَالَى, and in others فُعَال;) does not<br>\
form a pl. on the measure أَفْعِلَةٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  AHn<br>\
says, that in this verse of Aboo-Dhu-eyb,<br>\
كَأَنَّمَا مَضْمَضَتْ مِن مَّاءِ أَكْرِبَةٍ<br>\
عَلَى سَيَابَةِ نَخلٍ دُونَهُ مَلَقُ<br>\
اكربة signifies Mountain-tops, from which the<br>\
water of the mountains flows down; and that its<br>\
pl. is كَرْبَةٌ: but ISd remarks, that this assertion<br>\
is not valid; because a sing. of such a measure<br>\
does not form a pl. on the measure أَفْعِلَةٌ. He<br>\
also says, in one place, that اكربة is [said to be]<br>\
pl. of كرابة, which signifies “ dates that fall<br>\
among the roots of the palm-branches; ” but<br>\
[that] this is a mistake: upon which ISd remarks, In like manner, [this] his saying is in<br>\
my opinion a mistake. (TA.)<br>\
كَرِيبَةٌ A misfortune; a calamity: (S:) or a<br>\
severe misfortune, or calamity: (K:) pl. كَرَائِبُ.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
الكَرُوبِيُّونَ (K) and الكَرُّوبِيُّونَ, or this latter is a<br>\
mistake, and الكَرُوبِيَّةُ, (TA,) [Hebr.<br>\
כְּרֻבִי�<br>\
Cherubim,] the chiefs, or princes, of the angels;<br>\
the archangels; (K;) of whom are Jebraeel and<br>\
Meekáeel and Isráfeel; who are also called<br>\
المُقَرَّبُونَ, accord. to Abu-l-&#39;Áliyeh: (TA:) the<br>\
nearest of the angels to the bearers of the throne:<br>\
so called from كرب as signifying “ nearness ” or<br>\
the “ being near: ” (L:) or from their firmness,<br>\
or compactness, of make; [see مُكْرَبٌ] because of<br>\
their strength, and their patience in worship: or<br>\
from كَرَبٌ, “ sorrow &amp;c., ” because of their fear<br>\
and awe of God. (MF.) Sh quotes the following of Umeiyeh:<br>\
كَرُوبِيَّةٌ مِنْهُمْ رُكُوعٌ وَسُجَّدٌ<br>\
[Archangels, among whom are (some) that bend<br>\
down the body, and (some) that prostrate<br>\
themselves]. (TA.)<br>\
مَا بِالدَّارِ كَرَّابٌ There is not any one in the<br>\
house. (S, K.)<br>\
كَارِبٌ [Becoming near; drawing near; approaching]: near; nigh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  &#39;Abd-Keys<br>\
Ibn-Khufáf El-Burjumee says,<br>\
أَبُنَىَّ إِنَّ أَبَاكَ كَارِبُ يَوْمِهِ<br>\
فَإِذَا دُعِيتَ إِلَى المَكَارِمِ فَا@عْجَلِ<br>\
[O my child, verily thy father is near to his day<br>\
(of death): therefore when thou shalt be called to<br>\
(the performance of ) generous actions, make<br>\
haste]. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  أَمْرٌ كَارِبُ An afflicting, distressing, or oppressive, affair. (TA.)<br>\
مُكْرَبٌ (assumed tropical:)  A joint full of sinews (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
hard hoof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A firm, or compact,<br>\
beast of carriage: (S:) a horse of strong and<br>\
firm make: (AA:) a firm, or compact, (or<br>\
strongly compacted, TA,) rope, building, joint, or<br>\
horse: (K:) a strong horse. (ISd.) ―<br>\
-b4-  مُكْرَبُ<br>\
المَفَاصِلِ, (A,) and المفاصل ↓ مَكْرُوبُ, (Lth,)<br>\
(tropical:)  An animal of firm joints. (Lth, A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  مُكْرَبُ<br>\
الخَلْقِ (assumed tropical:)  Of firm make. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  مُكْرَبَاتٌ<br>\
Camels that are brought to the doors of the tents,<br>\
or dwellings, in the season of severe cold, in order<br>\
that they may be warmed by the smoke: (K:)<br>\
[or] i. q. مُقْرَبَاتٌ: see مُقْرَبٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  دَلْوٌ مُكْرَبَةٌ<br>\
A bucket having a كَرَب attached to it. (S.)<br>\
مَكْرُوبٌ and ↓ كَرِيبٌ Afflicted, distressed, or<br>\
oppressed, by sorrow, grief, or anxiety. (K,<br>\
Msb.)<br>\
