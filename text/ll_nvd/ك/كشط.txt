took off, or stripped off, (S, Msb, K,) a thing<br>\
(Msb, K) from (عَنْ) a thing which it covered;<br>\
(K;) as, for instance, the housing, or covering,<br>\
(S, K,) from a horse, (K,) or from the back of<br>\

same. (Ham., p. 693.) It is said in the Kur,<br>\
[lxxxi. 11,] وَإِذَا السَّمَآءُ كُشِطَتْ And when the<br>\
heaven shall be removed from its place, like as a<br>\
roof is removed from its place; (Zj, K;) and in<br>\
like manner قُشِطَتٌ, (Zj, S, *) accord. to the<br>\
reading of &#39;Abd-Allah [Ibn-Mes&#39;ood]: (S:) or<br>\
shall be pulled off and folded together. (Fr.)<br>\

as above, (Msb,) and so the inf. n., (S, Msb,)<br>\
I skinned the camel: (S, Msb:) you should not<br>\
