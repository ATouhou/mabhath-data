(S, A, K) [and app. كُبُوشٌ] and كُبُوشَةٌ, like<br>\
صُقُورَةٌ from صَقْرٌ. (TA.) The female is not<br>\
called كَبْشَةٌ, but نَعْجَةٌ. (IJ. [See رَاجِلَةٌ.]) ―<br>\

[Hence,] (tropical:)  The chief, or lord, of a people, or<br>\
company of men; (S, K;) their leader: (K:)<br>\
or their strenuous defender, or protector, and the<br>\
one of them to whom others look. (TA.) You say,<br>\
هُوَ كَبْشُ الكَتِيبَةِ (A, TA) (tropical:)  He is the leader of<br>\
the army, or troop: (TA:) and هُمْ كِبَاشُ<br>\
الكَتَائِبِ (tropical:)  [They are the leaders of the armies,<br>\

(tropical:)  Heroes, or brave men. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  Aged<br>\
and learned persons. (TA in art. خرف.) ―<br>\

so in the present day: pl. كُبُوشٌ.] You say,<br>\
بَنَوْا سُورًا حَصِينًا وَوَثَّقُوهُ بِالكُبُوشِ (tropical:)  [They built a<br>\
strong town-wall, and made it firm with the<br>\

Whence the sayings,] بَنُو فُلَانٍ كَبْشَةُ رُذَلَآءَ (assumed tropical:)  [The<br>\
sons of such a one are a gang of vile persons]: and<br>\
كَبْشَةُ دُنَسَآءَ (assumed tropical:)  [a gang of dirty, or filthy,<br>\
persons]: thus they use this word to intimate<br>\
dispraise: but [SM adds,] I know not how this<br>\
is. (TA.) [Perhaps SM means that he doubts<br>\
whether the word thus used be classical or not:<br>\
for as to its signification, it is well known.]<br>\
كَبَّاشٌ An owner, [or a tender] of كِبَاش [or<br>\
rams]. (TA.)<br>\
