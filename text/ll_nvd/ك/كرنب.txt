كرنب, inf. n. كَرْنَبَةٌ, He fed a guest<br>\
with كَرْنِيب. (K.) Ex. كَرْنِبُوا لِضَيْفِكُمْ فَإِنَّهُ<br>\
لَتَْحَانُ Feed your guest with كرنيب, for he is<br>\
hungry. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, He ate [كرنيب, or]<br>\
dates with milk. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  AHei and others assert<br>\
the ن to be augmentative; but in the T, L, and<br>\
K it is implied that it is radical. (MF.)<br>\
كُرْنُبٌ, with damm; [so in the copies of the<br>\
K in my hands, and in the O, and so accord. to<br>\
the TA; but I think that the correct reading is<br>\
كُرُنْبٌ, as the word is written by Golius, in one<br>\
place, and by Freytag; although, in the K, by<br>\
the words “ with damm, ” in the case of a quadriliteral word, is generally meant “ with damm<br>\
to the first and third letters ”;] and كَرَنْبٌ;<br>\
(K;) but it is commonly pronounced with damm<br>\
[app. meaning to the first and second letters:<br>\
كُرُنْب being the name now commonly given to<br>\
the brassica oleracea, or cabbage; in Greek<br>\
kra/mbh]: (TA:) the [vegetable also called] سِلْقٌ<br>\
[properly beet; for which, possibly, cabbage<br>\
may have been mistaken]: (AHn, K:) or a<br>\
species thereof, (L, K,) sweeter and more tender<br>\
than the قُنَّبِيط; of which the wild kind is bitter;<br>\
and the quantity of two drachms of its roots,<br>\
dried and pulverized, mixed with wine (شَرَاب),<br>\
is a tried antidote against the bite of a viper.<br>\
(Ibn-El-Beytár, K.) It is said, by the botanists,<br>\
to be a Nabathean word, arabicized. (MF.)<br>\
كَرْنِيبٌ and كِرْنِيبٌ (K) and كرناب (so in the<br>\
TA) i. q. مَجِيعَ, (K,) which is the same as كُدَيْرَاءُ:<br>\
(IAar:) Dates with milk. (T.)<br>\
