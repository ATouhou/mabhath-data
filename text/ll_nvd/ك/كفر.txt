كَفَرَ الشَّىْءَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c,) aor.,<br>\
in the sense first explained below<br>\
كَفِرَ, (S, K,<br>\
&amp;c.;) [respecting which Fei observes,] ElFárábee, whom J follows, says that it is like<br>\
يَضْرِبُ, but in a trustworthy copy of the T it<br>\
is written<br>\
كَفُرَ, and this is the proper form, because<br>\
they say that كَفَرَ النِّعْمَةَ [of which the aor. is<br>\
كَفُرَ]<br>\
is borrowed from كَفَرَ الشَّىْءَ in the sense which is<br>\
first explained below; (Msb;) and MF says,<br>\
that the saying of J, following his maternal<br>\
uncle Aboo-Nasr El-Fárábee, that the aor. of<br>\
this verb is<br>\
كَفِرَ, is doubtless a mistake; but to<br>\
this, [says SM,] I reply, that it is correctly<br>\
كَفِرَ, as<br>\
J and F and other leading lexicologists have said;<br>\
though the aor. of the verb of كُفْرٌ as meaning<br>\
the contr. of إِيْمَانٌ is<br>\
كَفُرَ; (TA;) [or, if this latter<br>\
verb be taken from the former, the aor. of the<br>\
former may have been originally<br>\
كَفِرَ and<br>\
كَفُرَ, and<br>\
general usage may have afterwards applied the<br>\
aor.<br>\
كَفِرَ to one signification, while the aor.<br>\
كَفُرَ has<br>\
been applied by very few persons to that signification, but by all to the significations thence<br>\
derived;] inf. n. كَفْرٌ; (S, Msb;) and ↓ كفّرهُ,<br>\
(A, Mgh, K,) inf. n. تَكْفِيرٌ; (TA;) He veiled,<br>\
concealed, hid, or covered, the thing: (S, A, *<br>\
Mgh, * Msb, K: *) or he covered the thing so as to<br>\
destroy it: (Az, TA:) and كَفَرَ عَلَيْهِ, aor. [and<br>\
inf. n.] as above, he covered it; covered it over.<br>\
(K,) You say كَفَرَ البَذْرَ الْمَبْذُورَ CCC He covered<br>\
the sown seed with earth. (TA.) And كَفَرَ<br>\
السَّحَابُ السَّمَآءَ The clouds covered the sky. (A.)<br>\
Lebeed says,<br>\
فِى لَيْلَةٍ كَفَرَ النُّجُومَ غَمَامُهَا<br>\
In a night whereof the clouds that covered the<br>\
sky concealed the stars. (Msb.) You say also<br>\
كَفَرَهُ اللَّيْلُ, and كَفَرَ عَلَيْهِ, The night covered it<br>\
with its blackness. (TA.) And كَفَرَتِ الرِّيحُ<br>\
الرَّسْمَ The wind covered the trace or mark [with<br>\
dust.] (A.) And كَفَرَ فَوْقَ دِرْعِهِ He clad himself with a garment over his coat of mail. And<br>\
دِرْعَهُ بِثَوْبٍ ↓ كَفَّرَ He covered his coat of mail<br>\
with a garment. (TA.) And كَفَرَ مَتَاعَهُ He<br>\
put his goods in a receptacle. (TA.) And<br>\
كَفَرَ الْمَتَاعَ فِى الوِعَآءِ CCC He covered, or concealed,<br>\
the goods in the receptacle. (A.) And ↓ كَفَّرَ<br>\
نَفْسَهُ بِالسِّلَاحِ He covered himself with the arms.<br>\
(A.) And كَفَرَ الجَهْلُ عَلَى عِلْمِ فُلَانٍ Ignorance<br>\
covered over the knowledge of such a one. (TA.)<br>\
وَكَيْفَ تَكْفُرُونَ, [thus, with damm as the vowel<br>\
of the aor.,] in the Kur, iii. 96, has been explained as signifying And wherefore do ye cover<br>\
the familiarity and love in which ye were living?<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (Msb, TA,) كَفَرَ, (S,) and<br>\
كَفَرَ النِّعْمَةَ, and بِالنِّعْمَةِ; (Msb;) and كَفَرَ<br>\
نِعْمَةَ ا@للّٰهِ, and بِنِعْمَةِ ا@للّٰهِ; (K;) aor.<br>\
كَفُرَ, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. كُفْرَانٌ. (S, K,) which is the most common<br>\
form in this case, (El-Basáïr,) and كُفُورٌ, (S,<br>\
K,) and كُفْرٌ; (El-Basáïr;) He covered, or<br>\
concealed, (Msb,) and denied, or disacknowledged,<br>\
the favour or benefit [conferred upon him]; (S,<br>\
Msb;) he was ungrateful, or unthankful, or<br>\
behaved ungratefully or unthankfully; contr. of<br>\
شَكَرَ; (S;) and he denied, or disacknowledged,<br>\
and concealed, or covered, the favour or benefit of<br>\
God: (K:) God&#39;s favours or benefits are the<br>\
signs which show to those who have discrimination that their Creator is one, without partner,<br>\
and that He has sent apostles with miraculous<br>\
signs and revealed scriptures and manifest<br>\
proofs. (Az, TA.) وَلَا نَكْفُرُكَ, in the prayer<br>\
[termed القُنُوتُ], means وَلَا نَكْفُرُ نِعْمَتَكَ [And we<br>\
will not deny, or disacknowledge, thy favour; or<br>\
we will not be ungrateful, or unthankful, for it].<br>\
(Msb.) [The verb when used in this sense,<br>\
seems, from what has been said above, to be a<br>\
حَقِيقَة عُرْفِيَّة, or word so much used in a particular tropical sense as to be, in that sense,<br>\
conventionally regarded as proper.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
hence, كَفَرَ, inf. n. كُفْرَانٌ, is used to signify<br>\
[absolutely] He denied, or disacknowledged. (TA.)<br>\
[See the act. part. n., below: and see 3. See<br>\
also art. ف, p. 2322 a.] You say كَفَرَ بِالصَّانِعِ<br>\
He denied the Creator. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Hence also,<br>\
(TA.) كَفَرَ, (S, Msb,) aor.<br>\
كَفُرَ, (Msb, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
كُفُرٌ, (S, Msb, K,) which is the most common<br>\
form in this case, (El-Basáïr,) and كَفْرٌ (K)<br>\
and كُفْرَانٌ (Msb, K) and كُفُورٌ, (K,) He disbelieved; he became an unbeliever, or infidel;<br>\
contr. of آمَنَ, inf. n. إِيْمَانٌ. (S, K.) You say<br>\
كَفَرَ بِا@للّٰهِ (S, Msb) He disbelieved in God: (S:)<br>\
because he who does so conceals, or covers, the<br>\
truth, and the favours of the liberal Dispenser of<br>\
favours [who is God]. (MF.) [Also, as shown<br>\
above, He denied God.] It is related in a<br>\
trad. of &#39;Abd-El-Melik, that he wrote to El-<br>\
Hajjáj, مَنْ أَقَرَّ بِالكُفْرِ فَخَلِّ سَبِيلَهُ, meaning,<br>\
Whosoever confesses the unbelief of him who<br>\
opposes the Benoo-Marwán, and goes forth<br>\
against them, let him go his way. (TA.) See<br>\
also كُفْرٌ, below. ―<br>\
-b5-  [He blasphemed: a signification very common in the present day.] ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
Also, كَفَرَ بِكَذَا He declared himself to be clear,<br>\
or quit, of such a thing. (Msb.) In this sense<br>\
it is used in the Kur xiv. 27. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
And كَفَرَ also signifies He was remiss, or fell<br>\
short of his duty, with respect to the law, and<br>\
neglected the gratitude or thankfulness to God<br>\
which was incumbent on him. So in the Kur<br>\
xxx. 43; as is shown by its being opposed to<br>\
عَمِلَ صَالِحًا. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  كَفَرَ لَهُ, inf. n. كَفْرٌ:<br>\
see 2.<br>\
2<br>\
كفّرهُ, inf. n. تَكْفِيرٌ: see 1, first signification,<br>\
in three places.<br>\
-A2-  Hence, كَفَّرَ الذَّنْبَ It (war<br>\
in the cause of God [or the like]) covered, or<br>\
concealed, the crime or sin: (Mgh:) (or expiated it: or annulled it; for] تكفير with respect<br>\
to acts of disobedience is like إِحْبَاطٌ with respect<br>\
to reward. (S, K.) The saying in the Kur<br>\
[v. 70.] لَكَفَّرْنَا عَنْهُمْ سَيِّئَاتِهِمْ means, We would<br>\
cover, or conceal, their sins, so that they should<br>\
become as though they had not been: or it may<br>\
mean, We would do away with their sins; as is<br>\
indicated by another saying in the Kur [xi. 116,]<br>\
“ good actions do away with sins. ” (El-Basáïr.)<br>\
كَفَّرَ ا@للّٰهُ عَنْهُ الذَّنْبَ signifies God effaced his<br>\
sin. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And كَفَّرَ عَنْ يَمِينِهِ [He expiated his oath;] he performed, (Msb,) or gave,<br>\
(K,) what is termed كَفَّارَة [i. e. a fast, or alms,<br>\
for the expiation of his oath]: (Msb, K:)<br>\
تَكْفِيرٌ of an oath is the doing what is incumbent,<br>\
or obligatory, for the violation, or breaking,<br>\
thereof: (S:) كَفَّرَ يَمِينَهُ is a vulgar phrase.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
-A3-  كَفَّرَهُ as syn. with أَكْفَرَهُ: see 4.<br>\
-A4-<br>\
كَفَّرَ لَهُ, inf. n. تَكْفِيرٌ, (A, Mgh, TA,) He did<br>\
obeisance to him, lowering his head, or bowing,<br>\
and bending himself, and putting his hand upon<br>\
his breast: (Mgh:) or put his hand upon his<br>\
breast and bent himself down to him: (TA:)<br>\
or he made a sign of humbling himself to him;<br>\
did obeisance to him: (A:) namely, an عِلْج<br>\
[or unbeliever of the Persians or other foreigners]<br>\
(A, Mgh) or a ذِمِّىّ [or free non- Muslim subject<br>\
of a Muslim government, i. e., a Christian, a Jew,<br>\
or a Sabian] (Mgh) to the king; (A, Mgh;) or<br>\
a slave to his master, or to his دِهْقَان [or chief]:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ كَفَرَ, [aor.<br>\
كَفُرَ, accord. to the rule of<br>\
of the K,] (TK,) inf. n. كَفْرٌ, (K,) he (a Persian,<br>\
فَارِسِىٌّ, K, and so in the L and other lexicons,<br>\
but in the TS فَارِس, without ى, which is<br>\
probably a mistake of copyists, TA) paid honour<br>\
to his king, (K, TA,) by making a sing with his<br>\
head, near to prostration: (TA:) تَكْفِيرٌ is a<br>\
man&#39;s humbling himself to another, (S, K, TA,)<br>\
bending himself, and lowering his head, nearly in<br>\
the manner termed رُكُوعٌ; as one does when he<br>\
desires to pay honour to his friend; (TA;) or<br>\
as the عِلْج does to the دِهْقَان: (S:) and the<br>\
تكفير of the people of the scriptures [or Christians<br>\
and Jews, and Sabians] one&#39;s lowering his head<br>\
to his friend, like the تَسْلِيم with the Muslims:<br>\
or one&#39;s putting his hand, or his two hands, upon<br>\
his breast: (TA:) and تكفير in prayer is the<br>\
bending one&#39;s self much in the state of standing,<br>\
before the action termed رُكُوعٌ; the doing of<br>\
which was disapproved by Mohammad, accord.<br>\
to a trad. (TA.) It is said in a trad., إِذَا أَصْبَحَ<br>\
ا@بْنُ آدَمَ فَإِنَّ الأَعْضَآءَ تُكَفِّرُ كُلُّهَا لِلِّسَانِ When the<br>\
son of Adam rises in the morning, verily all the<br>\
members abase themselves to the tongue, (Mgh,<br>\
TA,) and confess obedience to it, and humbly<br>\
submit to its command. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تَكْفِيرٌ also<br>\
signifies The crowning a king with a crown,<br>\
[because] when he, or it, is seen, obeisance is<br>\
done to him (إِذَا رُئِىَ كُفِّرَ لَهُ). (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also<br>\
تَكْفِيرٌ below.<br>\
3<br>\
كَافَرَنِى حَقِّى He denied, or disacknowledged,<br>\
to me my right, or just claim. (A, Mgh, K.)<br>\
Hence the saying of &#39;Ámir, إِذَا أَقَرَّ عِنْدَ القَاضِى<br>\
بِشَىْءٍ ثُمَّ كَافَرَ [When he confesses a thing in the<br>\
presence of the Kádee, then denies, or disacknowledges: كَافَرَ being thus used in the sense of<br>\
كَفَرَ]. But as to the saying of Mohammad<br>\
[the lawyer], رجُلٌ لَهُ عَلَى آخَرَ دَيْنٌ فَكَافَرَهُ بِهِ سِنِينَ<br>\
[A man who owed to another a debt, and denied<br>\
to him, in the case of it, for years], he seems to<br>\
have made it imply the meaning of المُمَاطَلَة,<br>\
and therefore to have made it trans. in the same<br>\
manner as المماطلة is trans. (Mgh.)<br>\
4<br>\
اكفرهُ, (S, A, Mgh, K,) and ↓ كفّرهُ, (A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) [the latter of which is the more<br>\
common in the present day,] He called him a<br>\
كَافِر [i. e. a disbeliever, an unbeliever, or an<br>\
infidel]: (S, Mgh, K:) he attributed, or imputed<br>\
to him, charged him with, or accused him of,<br>\
disbelief, or infidelity: (S, A, Msb:) or he said<br>\
to him كَفَرْتَ [Thou hast become an unbeliever,<br>\
or infidel, or Thou hast blasphemed: in this last<br>\
sense, “ he said to him Thou hast blasphemed, ”<br>\
كفّرهُ, to which alone it is assigned in the Msb,<br>\
is very commonly used in the present day].<br>\
(Msb.) Hence the saying, لَا تُكْفِرْ أَحَدًا مِنْ أَهْلِ<br>\
قِبْلَتِكَ Do not thou attribute or impute disbelief<br>\
or infidelity to any one of the people of thy<br>\
kibleh; (S, TA;) i. e., do not thou call any such<br>\
a disbeliever, &amp;c.; or do not thou make him such<br>\
by thine assertion and thy saying. (TA.)<br>\
لَا تُكَفِّرُوا أَهْلَ قِبْلَتِكُمْ is not authorized by the<br>\
relation, though it be allowable as a dial. form.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also] أَكْفَرْتُهُ, inf. n. إِكْفَارٌ, I made<br>\
him a disbeliever, an unbeliever, or an infidel;<br>\
I compelled him to become a disbeliever, &amp;c.<br>\
(Msb.) And أَكْفَرَ فُلَانٌ صَاحِبَهُ Such a one<br>\
compelled his companion by evil treatment to<br>\
become disobedient after he had been obedient.<br>\
(Mgh.) And أَكْفَرَ الرَّجُلُ مُطِيعَهُ The man compelled him who had obeyed him to disobey him:<br>\
(T, TA:) or he made him to be under a necessity<br>\
to disobey him. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اكفر He (a man,<br>\
TA) kept, or confined himself, to the كَفْر, (K,)<br>\
i. e. قَرْيَة [town or village]; (TA;) as also ↓ اكتفر.<br>\
(IAar, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تكفّر بِالسِّلَاحِ He covered himself with the<br>\
arms. And تكفّر بِالثَّوْبِ He enveloped himself<br>\
entirely with the garment. (A.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِكْتَفَرَ see 4, last signification.<br>\
كَفْرٌ The darkness and blackness of night;<br>\
[because it conceals things;] as also, sometimes,<br>\
↓ كِفْرٌ. (S, K.) [See also كَافِرٌ.] See a verse<br>\
cited voce ذُكَآءُ.<br>\
-A2-  Earth, or dust; because<br>\
it conceals what is beneath it. (Lh.)<br>\
-A3-  [Hence<br>\
also] A grave, or sepulchre: (S, K:) pl. كُفُورٌ.<br>\
(S.) Whence the saying, أَللّهُمَّ ا@غْفِرْ لِأَهْلِ الكُفُورِ<br>\
[O God, pardon the people of the graves]. (S.)<br>\
-A4-  [And hence, perhaps,] A town, or village;<br>\
[generally the latter;] syn. قَرْيَةٌ: (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K:) a Syriac word, and mostly used by the<br>\
people of Syria [and of Egypt]: or, accord. to<br>\
El-Harbee, land that is far from men, by which<br>\
no one passes: (TA:) pl. كُفُورٌ: (S, Msb:)<br>\
in the present day, it is applied in Egypt to<br>\
any small قَرْيَة [or village] by the side of a great<br>\
قَرْيَة [or town]: they say القَرْيَةُ الفُلَانِيَّةُ وَكَفْرُهَا<br>\
[Such a town and its village]: and sometimes<br>\
one قَرْيَة has a number of كُفُور. (TA.) Hence<br>\
the saying of Mo&#39;áwiyeh, أَهْلُ الكُفُورِ هُمْ أَهْلُ القُبُورِ<br>\
[The people of the villages are the people of the<br>\
graves]; meaning, that they are as the dead;<br>\
they do not see the great towns and the performance of the congregational prayers of Friday:<br>\
(S, Mgh:) by الكفور he meant the villages<br>\
(القُرَى) remote from the great towns and from<br>\
the places where the people of science assemble,<br>\
so that ignorance prevails among their inhabitants, and they are most quickly affected by<br>\
innovations in religion and by natural desires<br>\
which cause to err. (Az, TA.) Hence also<br>\
the trad. (of Aboo-Hureyreh, TA), لَيُخْرِجَنَّكُمُ<br>\
ا@لرُّومُ مِنْهَا كَفْرًا كَفْرًا [The Greeks will assuredly<br>\
expel you from them, town by town, or village by<br>\
village]; (S, * TA;) i. e. from the فُرًى of Syria.<br>\
(S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  كَفْرٌ عَلَى كَفْرٍ also signifies One<br>\
upon another; or one part upon another. (TA.)<br>\
كُفْرٌ: see 1. [As a simple subst., Ingratitude,<br>\
&amp;c. ―<br>\
-b2-  And particularly Denial, or disacknowledgment, of favours or benefits, and especially<br>\
of those conferred by God: and disbelief, unbelief; infidelity.] It is of four kinds: كُفْرُ إِنْكَارٍ<br>\
the denial, or disacknowledgment, of God, with<br>\
the heart and the tongue, having no knowledge of<br>\
what is told one of the unity of God [&amp;c.]:<br>\
and كُفْرُ جُحُودٍ the acknowledgment with the<br>\
heart without confessing with the tongue: [or<br>\
the disacknowledgment of God with the tongue<br>\
while the heart acknowledges Him:] and كُفْرُ<br>\
المُعَانَدَةِ the knowledge of God with the heart,<br>\
and confession with the tongue, with refusal to<br>\
accept [the truth]: and كُفْرُ النِّفَاقِ the confession with the tongue with disbelief in the heart:<br>\
all of these are unpardonable: (L, TA:) the<br>\
greatest كُفْر is the denial, or disacknowledgment,<br>\
of the unity [of God], or of the prophetic office<br>\
[of Mohammad and others], or of the law of<br>\
God. (El-Basáïr.) [Also, Blasphemy. Its pl.,<br>\
as a simple subst. in all these senses, is said<br>\
to be كُفُورٌ.]. Akh says, that كُفُورًا [in the<br>\
accus. case] in the Kur xvii. 101, [to which may<br>\
be added v. 91 of the same ch., and xxv. 52,]<br>\
is pl. of كُفْرٌ, like as بُرُودٌ is pl. of بُرْدٌ. (S.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Tar, or pitch, syn. قِيرٌ; with which ships are<br>\
smeared; (K;) of which there are three sorts,<br>\
كُفْرٌ and قِيرٌ and زِفتٌ: كفر is melted, and<br>\
then ships are smeared with it: [whence, app.,<br>\
its name, from its being a covering:] زفت is<br>\
used for smearing skins for wine, &amp;c. (ISh.)<br>\
كِفْرٌ: see كَفْرٌ.<br>\
كَفَرٌ: see كَافُورٌ.<br>\
كَفْرَةٌ: see كَافِرٌ.<br>\
كُفَرَّى, and its variations: see كَافُورٌ.<br>\
كَفُورٌ: see كافر.<br>\
كَفَّارٌ: see كافر.<br>\
كَفَّارَةٌ a subst. from تَكْفِيرُ اليَمِينِ, (S,) or an<br>\
intensive epithet in which the quality of a subst.<br>\
predominates; signifying [An expiation for a<br>\
sin or crime or a violated oath;] an action, or a<br>\
quality, which has the effect of effacing a wrong<br>\
action or sin or crime; (TA;) that which covers,<br>\
or conceals, sins or crimes; such as the كفّارة of<br>\
oaths [violated], and that of [the kind of divorce<br>\
termed] ظِهَار, and of unintentional homicide;<br>\
(T, TA;) an expiation (مَا كُفِّرَ بِهِ), such as an<br>\
alms-giving, and a fasting, and the like: (K:)<br>\
pl. كَفَّارَاتٌ. (T, TA.)<br>\
كَافِرٌ A sower: (S, K:) or a tiller of the<br>\
ground: (Msb:) because he covers over the seed<br>\
with earth: (S, Msb: *) pl. كُفَّارٌ. (S, TA.)<br>\
The pl. is said by some to be thus used in the<br>\
Kur lvii. 19. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Dark clouds, or a dark<br>\
cloud; (K;) because it conceals what is beneath<br>\
it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Night: (K:) or intensely black<br>\
night; because it conceals everything by its<br>\
darkness. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The darkness; (K;) because<br>\
it covers what is beneath it; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ كَفْرَةٌ, accord. to the copies of the K; but in<br>\
the L, كَفْرٌ, q. v. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  The sea; (S, A, K;)<br>\
for the same reason. (TA.) Thaalabeh Ibn-<br>\
So&#39;eyr El-Mazinee says, (S, TA,) describing a<br>\
male and a female ostrich and their returning to<br>\
their eggs at sunset, (TA,)<br>\
فَتَذَكَّرَا ثَقَلًا رَثِيدًا بَعْدَمَا<br>\
أَلْقَتْ ذُكَآءُ يَمِينَهَا فِى كَافِرِ<br>\
[And they remembered goods placed side by side,<br>\
after the sun had cast its right side into a sea];<br>\
i. e., the sun had begun to set: or the poet may<br>\
mean [by كافر] night: (S, TA:) but Sgh says,<br>\
that the right reading is تَذَكَّرَتْ; the pronoun<br>\
referring to the female ostrich. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also,<br>\
A great river: (S, K:) used in this sense by<br>\
El-Mutalemmis: (S:) and a great valley. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  [A man] staying, or abiding, [in a place,]<br>\
and hiding himself. (TA.) [See an ex. voce<br>\
عَرْشٌ.] ―<br>\
-b8-  [A man] wearing arms; covered with<br>\
arms: (Az, K:) as also ↓ مُكَفِّرٌ (A, K) and ↓ مُتَكَفِّرٌ<br>\
(S, A) and ↓ مُكَفَّرٌ: (A:) or this last signifies<br>\
bound fast in iron; (K, TA;) as though covered<br>\
and concealed by it: (TA:) pl. of the first,<br>\
كُفَّارٌ. (K.) Hence the following, (K,) said by<br>\
Mohammad during the pilgrimage of valediction,<br>\
(TA,) لَا تَرْجِعُوا بِعْدِى كُفَّارًا يَضْرِبُ بَعْضُكُمْ رِقَابَ<br>\
بَعْضٍ (K) [Do not ye become again, after me,<br>\
i. e., after my death,] wearers of arms, preparing yourselves for fight, [one party of you<br>\
smiting the necks of others;] as though he meant<br>\
thereby to forbid war: (AM, TA:) or [do not<br>\
ye become unbelievers, after me, &amp;c.; i. e.,] do<br>\
not ye call people unbelievers, and so become<br>\
unbelievers [yourselves]. (AM, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  A<br>\
coat of mail; (Sgh, K;) because it conceals<br>\
what is beneath it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  One who has<br>\
covered his coat of mail with a garment worn<br>\
over it. (S.) ―<br>\
-b11-  كَافِرُ الدُّرُوعِ A garment that<br>\
is worn over the coat of mail. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  One<br>\
who denies, or disacknowledges, the favours or<br>\
benefits of God: (K:) [ungrateful; unthankful;<br>\
especially to God:] one who denies, or disacknowledges, the unity [of God], and the prophetic office [of Mohammad and others], and the<br>\
law of God, altogether, accord. to the common<br>\
conventional acceptation: a disbeliever; an unbeliever; an infidel; a miscreant; contr. of<br>\
مُؤْمِنٌ: (El- Basáïr:) because he conceals the<br>\
favours of God: (S:) or because his heart is<br>\
covered; as though it were of the measure<br>\
فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (IDrd,<br>\
TA:) or because كُفْر covers his heart altogether:<br>\
(Lth, TA:) i. e. having a covering to his heart:<br>\
or because, when God invites him to acknowledge<br>\
his unity, He invites him to accept his favours;<br>\
and when he refuses to do so, he covers the<br>\
favour of God, excluding it from him: (Az,<br>\
TA:) fem. with ة: (S, Msb, K:) pl. masc.<br>\
كَفَرَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the most common pl. of<br>\
كافر in the first of the senses explained above,<br>\
(El-Basáïr,) and كُفَّارٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the most<br>\
common pl. of the same in the last of those<br>\
senses, as contr. of مؤمن, (El-Basáïr,) and<br>\
كِفَارٌ (S, K) and كَافِرُونَ: (Msb:) and pl. fem.<br>\
كَوَافِرُ (S, Msb, K) and كَافِرَاتٌ: (Msb:) and<br>\
↓ رَجُلٌ كَفَّارٌ, and ↓ كَفُورٌ signify the same as كَافِرٌ:<br>\
(K:) or كَفُورٌ is an intensive epithet, meaning<br>\
very ungrateful, or unthankful, [&amp;c., especially<br>\
to God]: so in the Kur xxii. 65, and xliii. 14:<br>\
and كَفَّارٌ has a more intensive signification than<br>\
كَفُورٌ, [meaning habitually ungrateful, &amp;c.:] os<br>\
in the Kur ا 23: but sometimes it is used in<br>\
the sense of كَفُورٌ; as in the Kur xiv. 37: (ElBasáïr:) ↓ كَفُورٌ is fem. as well as masc.; (TA;)<br>\
and its pl. is كُفُرٌ, (K, * TA,) also both masc. and<br>\
fem.; and it has no unbroken pl. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, simply, Denying, or disacknowledging; a<br>\
denier, or disacknowledger: followed byبِ<br>\
before the thing denied: pl. كَافِرُونَ: (S, TA;)<br>\
so in the Kur ii. 38, (TA,) and xxviii. 48. (S,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Also, Blaspheming; a blasphemer.]<br>\
-A3-  See also كَافُورٌ.<br>\
كَافُورٌ The spathe, or envelope of the طَلْع [or<br>\
spadix], (As, S, K, TA,) or upper covering<br>\
thereof, (TA,) of a palm-tree; (As, S, K, TA;)<br>\
the كِمّ of a palm-tree: (Mgh, Msb:) as also<br>\
↓ كُفَرَّى, (S, Mgh, Msb,) with damm to the ك<br>\
and fet-h to the ف and teshdeed to the ر, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) or كُفُرَّى, [so in the copies of the K, and<br>\
so I have found it written in other works, so<br>\
that both forms appear to be correct,] and<br>\
كَفَرَّى and كِفِرَّى, (K, * TA,) and ↓ كَافِرٌ (AHn,<br>\
K) and ↓ كَفَرٌ: (K:) so called because it conceals<br>\
what is within it: (Mgh, Msb:) or, accord. to<br>\
AA and Fr, the طَلْع [by which they probably<br>\
mean the spathe, for, as is said in the Mgh,<br>\
it is applied by some to the كِمّ (or spathe)<br>\
before it bursts open]: (S:) [↓ كفرّى is sometimes<br>\
masc., though more properly and commonly<br>\
fem.:] IAar says, I heard Umm-Rabáh say.<br>\
هٰذِهِ كفرّى and هٰذَا كفّرى: (TA:) the pl. of<br>\
كَافُورٌ is كَوَافِيرُ; and the pl. of كَافِرٌ is كَوَافِرُ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  The زَمَع of the grape-vine;<br>\
(K, TA;) i. e., the leaves which cover what is<br>\
within them of the raceme; likened to the كافور<br>\
of the طلع; (TA;) the كِمّ [or calyx] of the<br>\
grapes, before the blossom comes forth; because<br>\
they cover the unopened raceme; accord. to IF,<br>\
as also ↓ كُفَرَّى: (Msb:) pl. كَوَافِيرُ and كَوَافِرُ,<br>\
accord. to the K; but it is well known that the<br>\
former is pl. of كافور, and the latter of كافر.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, accord. to some, (assumed tropical:)  The envelope<br>\
[or calyx] of any plant. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [Camphor;]<br>\
a kind of perfume, (S, K,) well known, from<br>\
certain trees [the laurus camphora of Linn.] in<br>\
the mountains of the sea of India and China,<br>\
which afford shadow to many people or creatures,<br>\
(K,) by reason of its greatness and its many<br>\
spreading branches, (TA,) which leopards or<br>\
panthers frequent, and the wood of which is<br>\
white and easily broken; the كافور is found<br>\
within it, and is of various kinds, in colour red,<br>\
and becoming white only by تَصْعِيد [or sublimation]. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  Accord. to the M, A mixture of<br>\
perfume, composed of the spathe (كافور) of the<br>\
spadix of the palm-tree. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  A certain<br>\
spring, or fountain, in paradise. (Fr. K.) So<br>\
in the Kur [lxxvi. 5,] إِنَّ ا@لْأَبْرَارَ يَشْرَبُونَ مِنْ<br>\
كَأْسٍ كَانَ مِزَاجُهَا كَافُورًا [Verily the pious shall<br>\
drink a cup of wine whereof the mixture is<br>\
Káfoor]. (Fr.) IDrd says, that it should be<br>\
imperfectly decl., because it is a fem. [proper]<br>\
name, determinate, of more than three letters;<br>\
but it is made perfectly decl. for the conformity<br>\
of the ends of the verses: Th says, that it is<br>\
made perfectly decl. because it is used by way of<br>\
comparison; and that if it were a [proper] name<br>\
of the spring, or fountain, it would be imperfectly decl.: Th means, says ISd, whereof the<br>\
mixture is like كافور [or camphor]: and Zj says,<br>\
that it may mean that the taste of perfume and<br>\
كافور is in it, or that it is mixed with كافور.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A5-  A certain plant, (Lth, K,) [which I<br>\
believe to he the same as the camphorata Monspeliensis, see my “ Thousand and One Nights, ”<br>\
ch. xxviii. note 6,] of sweet odour, (ISd, K,)<br>\
the flower of which is (Lth, K) white, (Lth,)<br>\
like the flower of the أُقْحُوَان [or camomile].<br>\
(Lth, K.)<br>\
-A6-  IDrd says, I do not think the<br>\
كافور is Arabic, because they sometimes say<br>\
قَفُورٌ and قَافُورٌ. (TA.)<br>\
أَكْفَرُ [More, or most, ungrateful or unthank-<br>\
ful, especially to God; or disbelieving or unbelieving]. (TA.)<br>\
تَكْفِيرٌ, as a subst., The crown of a king.<br>\
(ISd, K.)<br>\
مُكْفَّرٌ A bird covered with feathers. (A.) See<br>\
also كَافِرٌ: and see مَكْفُورٌ.<br>\
-A2-  One who, though<br>\
beneficent, is regarded, or treated, with ingratitude; (K;) a benefactor whose beneficence<br>\
is not gratefully acknowledged. (A.)<br>\
مُكَفِّرٌ: see كَافِرٌ.<br>\
رَمَادٌ مَكْفُورٌ Ashes upon which the wind has<br>\
swept the dust so that it has covered them. (S.)<br>\
See also مُكَفَّرٌ.<br>\
مُتَكَفِّرٌ: see كَافِرٌ.<br>\
