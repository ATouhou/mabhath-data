تكامأنا فى أَرْضِهِمْ [We, together, gathered<br>\
the truffles called كَمْء in their land]. (A.)<br>\
كَمْءٌ A well-known vegetable, (K,) [the<br>\
truffle,] which comes forth from the earth like<br>\
the فُطْر: or what is called شَحْمُ الأَرْضِ [the<br>\
fat of the earth]; and the Arabs also call it<br>\
جُدَرِىُّ الأَرْضِ [the small-pox of the earth]: it<br>\
is also said that the name of كَمْأَةٌ is given to<br>\
those [truffles] that incline to dust-colour and<br>\
black; and جبأة (q. v.) to those that incline to<br>\
red: كُحْل and تُوتِيَا are compounded with the<br>\
juice of this vegetable [to apply to the eye]:<br>\
Th also mentions كَمَاةٌ [as used for كَمْأَةٌ].<br>\
(TA.) The dual of كَمْءٌ is كَمْآنِ; (S;) the<br>\
pl. (of pauc., S) أَكْمُؤٌ; (S, K;) and [pl. of<br>\
mult.] كَمْأَةٌ: (K:) this last is not a pl. of كمء,<br>\
but a quasi-pl. n.: (Sb, K:) [or كَمْأَةٌ is rather a<br>\
coll. gen. n. of which the n. un. is without the<br>\
ة, contr. to analogy: (see جَبْءٌ:)] in speaking<br>\
of many, you say كَمْأَةٌ, contr. to analogy:<br>\
(S:) or كَمْأَةٌ is the sing., and كَمْءٌ pl.: or<br>\
[accord. to some,] كَمْأَةٌ is both sing. and pl.:<br>\
(K:) AHn mentions كَمْأَةٌ as sing., and كَمْأَتَانِ<br>\
as dual, and كَمْآتٌ as pl.: but the right opinion<br>\
is that of Sb. (TA.) [كَمْأَةٌ also signifies Any<br>\
kind of fungus, such as the mushroom, and<br>\
toadstool. See فُطْرٌ.]<br>\
كَمَّاءٌ One who sells, and who gathers for sale,<br>\
[the truffles called] كَمْء. (K.)<br>\
مَكْمَأَةٌ and مَكْمُؤَةٌ A place in which [the truffles<br>\
