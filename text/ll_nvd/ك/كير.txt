(Mgh, K:) or a blacksmith&#39;s skin (زِقّ), with<br>\
which he blows [his fire]: (Msb:) also, (Msb,)<br>\
composed of a thick skin (جِلْد, S, Msb, or زِقّ,<br>\
S), with حَافَات [or edges, forming a wide mouth,<br>\
which being opened and closed by means of two<br>\
pieces of wood to which the edges are sewed, the<br>\
skin becomes filled with air, which is then forced<br>\
out through a pipe at the end opposite the mouth:<br>\
such, at least, is the most common kind of<br>\
bellows used by the Arabs of the present day<br>\
with which I am acquainted]: but the thing<br>\
constructed of clay [in which the blacksmith<br>\
kindles his fire] is called كُورٌ: (S, Msb:) so<br>\
ISk says he heard AA say: (Msb:) [but see<br>\
كُورٌ: and see a verse cited in the last paragraph<br>\
of art. عور:] the pl. [of pauc.] is أَكْيَارٌ, and<br>\
[of mult.] كِيَرَةٌ (Msb, K) and كِيرَانٌ; (K;)<br>\
the last on the authority of Th; but doubtful;<br>\
for it is not known in the lexicons, and is<br>\
[properly] pl. of كُورٌ. (TA.)<br>\
