كُمْتَةٌ [A dark bay colour:] a red colour<br>\
mixed with blackness: (Kh, Sb:) or a red colour<br>\
mixed with قُنُوْء, (As, S, K,) which latter is<br>\
blackness that is not pure, or clear: (see كُمَيْتٌ:)<br>\
or a colour between black and red: (ISd:)<br>\
there are two kinds of كمتة; namely كُمْتَةُ<br>\
صُفْرَةٍ [yellow bay, or gilded bay,] and كُمْتَةُ حُمْرَةٍ<br>\
[red bay, or chestnut-bay]. (IAar.)<br>\
كُمَيْتٌ, masc. and fem., (S, K,) [A bay, or<br>\
dark bay, or brown, horse &amp;c.:] of a red colour<br>\
mixed with blackness: (Kh, Sb:) or of a red<br>\
colour mixed with قُنُوْء, (As, S, K,) which latter<br>\
is blackness that is not pure, or clear:<br>\
(TA [app. from As]:) [see كُمْتَةٌ, above:]<br>\
a camel is called أَحْمَرُ if of an unmixed red;<br>\
but if of a red colour mixed with قنوء, it is<br>\
called كميت: (As, S:) the difference between<br>\
كميت and أَشْقَرُ, as applied to horses, is in the<br>\
mane and the tail: if these are red, the animal<br>\
is called اشقر [i. e. sorrel]; and if they are black,<br>\
it is called كميت; (AO, S, TA;) and the وَرْد<br>\
is between these two: (AO, TA:) [all bay horses<br>\
have black manes, which distinguish them from the<br>\
sorrel, that have red or white manes: (Farrier&#39;s<br>\
Dict., quoted in Johnson&#39;s Dict., voce “ bay ”:)]<br>\
an epithet applied to the horse and the camel<br>\
and other animals: (ISd:) you say فَرَسٌ كميتٌ,<br>\
and مُهْرَةٌ كميتٌ, and بَعِيرٌ كميتٌ, and نَاقَةٌ<br>\
كميتٌ: (TA:) accord. to the Kh, as cited by<br>\
Sb, it is of the dim. form because it denotes a<br>\
colour between black and red, as though to<br>\
imply that it signifies what is near to each of<br>\
these two colours. (S.) In a marginal note<br>\
in the S, it is said to be a foreign word arabicized.<br>\
(TA.) [Perhaps from the Persian كُمِيCَهْ:<br>\
Freytag says, accord. to some from the Persian<br>\
كُميته.] See also أَكْمَتُ, and كُمْتَةٌ. The<br>\
Arabs say, that the كميت is the most powerful<br>\
of horses, and the strongest in the hoofs. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  تَمْرَةٌ كُمَيْتٌ (tropical:)  A date of the colour called<br>\
كُمَيْتٌ; [or, red tinged, or mixed, with black,<br>\
or of a blackish red colour]: it is one of the<br>\
kinds hardest, or toughest, in لِحَآء [i. e. pulp, or<br>\
flesh], and sweetest to chew. (AM.) ―<br>\
-b3-  تِينٌ<br>\
كُمَيْتٌ (tropical:)  A fig of that colour. (AHn.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
كُمَيْتٌ (tropical:)  a name of Wine; because there is in<br>\
it blackness and redness: (S:) or wine in which<br>\
is blackness and redness: (M, K:) used like a<br>\
proper name, [or rather as a subst.,] though<br>\
originally an epithet. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  كُمَيْتٌ is also<br>\
applied as an epithet to waste, or unowned, land.<br>\
(ISd.) ―<br>\
-b6-  كُمَيْتٌ A long, complete, month, or<br>\
year. (IAar.)<br>\

-b2-  خَيْلٌ كُمْتٌ, and ↓ كَمَاتِىٌّ, (K,) and<br>\
كَمَاتَى, of the same measure as عَذَارَى, (TA,)<br>\
Horses of the colour of that which is called كُمَيْتٌ,<br>\
(K,) كمت is a pl. formed from أَكْمَتُ; though<br>\
this sing. has not been used: (L:) and كماتى<br>\
is a pl. formed from كَمْتَاءُ [fem. of أَكْمَتُ]<br>\
regarded as a subst.; though this sing. also<br>\
has not been used. (TA.)<br>\
