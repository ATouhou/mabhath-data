كَرڤ3َ [كَرَّ, i. e.] كَرَّ بِنَفْسِهِ, as distinguished from<br>\
the trans. كَرَّ, [aor.<br>\
كَرُ3َ,] (S, Mgh,) inf. n. كرٌّ,<br>\
(S,) or كُرُورٌ, (Mgh,) [or both,] He returned.<br>\
(S, Mgh.) You say كَرَّ عَلَيْهِ, (A, K,) aor,<br>\
كَرُ3َ,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. كَرٌّ and كُرُورٌ and تَكْرَارٌ (A, K)<br>\
and كَرِيرٌ, (CK,) He turned to, or against, him,<br>\
or it: (A, K:) he returned to or against, it:<br>\
(TA:) the primary signification is the turning<br>\
to, or against, a thing, either in person, or in<br>\
act. (El-Basáïr.) And اِنْهَزَمَ ثُمَّ كَرَّ عَلَيْهِ [He<br>\
was put to flight: then he returned, or turned<br>\
back, against him]. (A.) And كَرَّ الفَارِسُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
كَرُ3َ, inf. n. كَرٌّ, The horseman [wheeled round,<br>\
or about, or] fled, to wheel round, or about, and<br>\
then returned to the fight: (Msb:) [or returned<br>\
to the fight after wheeling round, or about, or<br>\
retiring, or being put to flight; as is implied in<br>\
the phrase next preceding, from the A, and in<br>\
many other examples: and simply, he charged,<br>\
or assaulted: opposed to فَرَّ: see كَرَّةٌ, below.]<br>\
You say also الجَوَادُ يَصْلُحُ لِلْكَرِّ وَا@لْفَرِّ [The courser<br>\
is suitable, or fit, for returning to the fight, or<br>\
for charging, or assaulting, and fleeing]. (Msb.)<br>\
[And كَرَّ signifies He, or it, returned time after<br>\
time.] You say أَفْنَاهُ كَرُّ اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ The<br>\
returning of night and day time after time caused<br>\
him to come to an end. (Msb.) Also كَرَّ عَنْهُ<br>\
He returned from him, or it. (A, K.) And<br>\
عَنْ ذٰلِكَ ↓ تَكَرْكَرَ He returned from that. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  كَرَّ is also trans., as well as intrans.; (S,)<br>\
TA;) كَرَّهُ, (aor.<br>\
كَرُ3َ, TA,) inf. n. كَرٌّ, signifying<br>\
He made, or caused, him, or it, to return: (S,<br>\
Mgh, TA:) and [in like manner,] عَنْ ↓ كَرْكَرَهُ<br>\
كَذَا, inf. n. كَرْكَرَةٌ, he made him to return, or<br>\
revert, from such a thing. (TA.) You say<br>\
كَرَّ عَلَيْهِ رُمْحَهُ, and فَرَسَهُ, inf. n. كَرٌّ, [He turned<br>\
back his spear, and his horse, against him].<br>\
(A.)<br>\
-A3-  كَرَّ, aor.<br>\
كَرِ3َ, (S, K,) and [see. pers.<br>\
كَرِرْتَ,] aor.<br>\
كَرَ3َ, (K,) inf. n. كَرِيرٌ, (S, A, * K, *<br>\
TA,) He uttered a sound like that of one throttled,<br>\
or strangled: (S, K:) or like that of one harassed, or fatigued, or overburdened: (TA:)<br>\
or he rattled in his throat (حَشُرَجَ) in dying:<br>\
(AZ, S:) or he made a sound in his breast like<br>\
حَشْرَجَةٌ [or rattling in the throat in dying], (A,<br>\
TA) but not the same as this latter: and thus<br>\
do horses, in their breasts. (TA.) [See شَخَرَ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also, He (a sick man) gave up his spirit, at<br>\
death. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also كَرِيرٌ, below.<br>\
2<br>\
كرّرهُ, inf. n. تَكْرِيرٌ (S, Msb, K) and تَكْرَارٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) or the latter is a simple subst., (Msb,)<br>\
or, as AA said to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed Ed-Dareer, in<br>\
reply to a question respecting the difference<br>\
between the measures تَفْعَالٌ and تِفْعَالٌ, the<br>\
latter is a simple subst., and the former, with<br>\
fet-h, is an inf. n., (S, TA,) [but there are two<br>\
inf. ns. of the measure تِفْعَالٌ, both of unaugmented verbs, namely تِبْيَانٌ and تِلْقَآءٌ,] and تَكِرَّةٌ,<br>\
(Ibn-Buzurj, K,) [He repeated it, or reiterated<br>\
it, either once or more than once:] he repeated<br>\
it several times; reiterated it: (Msb:) or he<br>\
repeated it one time after another; (K;) which<br>\
may mean he tripled it, unless the “ other ” time<br>\
be not reckoned as a repetition; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ كَرْكَرَهُ; (K; [in the CK, كَرْكَرَةً is put by<br>\
mistake for كَرْكَرَهُ;]) either by act or by speech:<br>\
(MF:) it differs from أَعَادَهُ, which signifies<br>\
only “ he repeated it once; ” for none but the<br>\
vulgar say أَعَادَهُ مَرَّاتٍ; whereas كَرَّرَهُ may<br>\
signify [not only the same as أَعَادَهُ, as it does in<br>\
many instances, but also] he repeated it time<br>\
after time: (Aboo-Hilál El-&#39;Askeree:) some explain كَرَّرَهُ as signifying he mentioned it twice,<br>\
and he mentioned it one time after another:<br>\
(Sadr-ed-Deen Zádeh:) when it is used in the<br>\
former of these two senses, the term تَكْرَارٌ applies<br>\
to the second, and to the first [with respect to<br>\
the second]: (&#39;Ináyeh, in the early part of<br>\
chap. ii.; and TA:) but its explanation as<br>\
signifying the mentioning a thing one time after<br>\
another is a conventional rendering of the<br>\
rhetoricians: (MF:) Es-Suyootee says, that<br>\
تَكْرَارٌ signifies the renewing the first word or<br>\
phrase; and it denotes a sort of تَأْكِيد [or corroboration]: but it is said to be a condition of<br>\
تأكيد that the words or phrases [which are<br>\
repeated] be without interruption, and occur not<br>\
more than three times; and that تكرار differs<br>\
from it in both these particulars; so that the<br>\
phrase in the Kur, [chap. lv.,] فَبِأَىِّ آلَآءِ رَبِّكُمَا<br>\
تُكَذِّبَانِ is an instance of تكرار, not of تأكيد,<br>\
because it occurs [with interruptions and] more<br>\
than three times; and so another phrase in the<br>\
Kur, [chap. lxxvii.,] وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِلْمُكَذِّبِينَ. (TA.)<br>\
You say كَرَّر عَلَى سَمْعِهِ كَذَا [He repeated, or<br>\
reiterated, such a thing, or saying, to his ear, or<br>\
ears, or hearing]. (A.)<br>\
5<br>\
تكرّر [It became repeated, or reiterated:<br>\
and it recurred]. You say تكرّر عَلَيْهِ [It (a<br>\
saying) became repeated, or reiterated, to him].<br>\

R. Q. 1<br>\
كَرْكَرَهُ: see 1: and 2.<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَكَرْكَرَ: see 1.<br>\
كَرٌّ A rope [made in the form of a hoop] by<br>\
means of which one ascends a palm-tree; (S, K;)<br>\
accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, a name not applied to any<br>\
other rope; and so, says Az, I have heard from<br>\
the Arabs; it is made of the best of [the fibres<br>\
of the palm-tree called] لِيف: (TA:) or a thick<br>\
rope; (K;) accord. to AO, made of لِيف, and of<br>\
the outer covering (قِشْر) of the [portions of the<br>\
racemes of the palm-tree called] عَرَجِين and of<br>\
the [portion of the branch called] عَسِيب: (TA:)<br>\
or a rope, in general: (Th, K:) and the rope<br>\
[or sheet] of a sail: (S:) or the rope of a ship:<br>\
or the rope by which a ship is drawn: (TA:)<br>\
and a قَيْد [or pair of shackles, or hobbles,] made<br>\
of لِيف or of palm-leaves: (K:) pl. كُرُورٌ. (S,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  The thing that connects the [two pieces<br>\
of wood called] ظَلِفَتَانِ of the [kind of camel&#39;s<br>\
saddle called] رَحْل, (S, K,) and that enters [or<br>\
is inserted] into them: (S:) [See شَجْرٌ and<br>\
شَخْرٌ:] or the skin, or leather, into which the<br>\
ظَلِفَات of the رَحْل enter; occupying the same<br>\
place in the رَحْل as the بِدَادَانِ have in the قَتَب,<br>\
excepting that the بدادان do not appear before<br>\
the ظَلِفَة: (TA:) pl. أَكْرَارٌ. (S, TA.)<br>\
كُرٌّ A certain measure of capacity, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) of the people of El-&#39;Irák, (Mgh, K,)<br>\
for wheat; (S;) well known; (Msb;) consisting<br>\
of six ass-loads, (K,) that is, sixty times the<br>\
quantity called قَفِيز, (Az, Mgh, Msb, K,) accord.<br>\
to the people of El-&#39;Irák, (TA,) the قفيز being<br>\
eight مَكَاكِيك, [in the TA, six, but this is a<br>\
mistake,] and the مَكُّوك being a صَاع and a half,<br>\
which is three كِيلَجَات; so that the كُرّ, accord.<br>\
to this reckoning, is twelve times the quantity<br>\
called وَسْق, (Az, Mgh, Msb,) each وسق being<br>\
sixty times the quantity called صاع: (Az, Mgh:)<br>\
in the Kitáb Kudámeh, it is said that the<br>\
كُرّ called المُعَدَّلُ is sixty times the quantity<br>\
called قفيز, and the قفيز is ten أَعْشِرَآء: and the<br>\
كُرّ called القَنْقَلُ is twice the quantity of the<br>\
كُرّ مُعَدَّل, that is, by the قفيز of the معدّل, a<br>\
hundred and twenty times the quantity of the<br>\
قفيز; with this كرّ are measured unripe dates<br>\
and dried dates and also olives, in the districts of<br>\
El-Basrah; and the قفيز used for measuring<br>\
dates is twenty-five times the رِطْل of Baghdád;<br>\
so that the كُرُّ القَنْقَلِ is three thousand times as<br>\
much as the رطل: and the كُرّ called الهَاشِمِىُّ is<br>\
the third part of the معدّل, that is, twenty times<br>\
as much as the قفيز, by the measure of the<br>\
معدّل; with this كُرّ, rice is measured: and the<br>\
كُرّ called الهَارُونِىُّ is equal to them two [but what<br>\
these two are is not shown]: and the أَهْوَازِىّ is<br>\
equal to them two: and the مَخْتُوم is sixth<br>\
part of the قفيز: and the قفيز is the tenth part<br>\
of the جَرِيب: (Mgh:) or the كُرّ is forty times<br>\
as much as the quantity called إِرْدَبّ; (K;) by<br>\
the reckoning of the people of Egypt, as ISd<br>\
says: (TA:) the pl. is إِكرَار. (S, Msb.) [It<br>\
is app. connected with the Hebrew<br>\
כֹּר, whence<br>\
the Greek ko/ros (a measure containing, accord.<br>\
to Josephus, six Attic medimni,) occurring<br>\
in Luke xvi. 7.]<br>\
كَرَّةٌ A return. (Msb.) So in the Kur,<br>\
[ii. 162,] لَوْ أَنَّ لَنَا كَرَّةً [Would that there were<br>\
for us] a return to the world, or former state.<br>\
And so in xxvi. 102, and xxxix. 59. (Jel.)<br>\
And so in the saying of Mohammad, اللّٰهَ اللّٰهَ<br>\
وَا@لْكَرَّةَ عَلَى نَبِيِّكُمْ Fear ye God, [fear ye God,]<br>\
and return to your prophet. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,<br>\
The return to life;] the resurrection; the renewal<br>\
of mankind, or of the creation, after perishing.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also, A return to the fight,<br>\
after wheeling away, or retiring: and simply,]<br>\
a charge, or an assault, (Mgh, K,) in war;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ كُرَّى: (Sgh, K:) pl. كَرَّاتٌ.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence also,] A time; one time; [in<br>\
the sense of the French “ fois ”; generally<br>\
repeated, or used in the pl. form, so as to denote<br>\
a returning to an action, once, or more; i. e.,<br>\
repetition, or reiteration, thereof, agreeably with<br>\
the primary signification;] syn. مَرَّةٌ: (S, K:)<br>\
pl. as above. (S.) You say فَعَلَهُ كَرَّةً بَعْدَ كَرَّةٍ<br>\
[He did it time after time]. And فَعَلَهُ كَرَّاتٍ<br>\
[He did it several times]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence also,]<br>\
A turn to prevail against an opposing party;<br>\
victory. So in the Kur, [xvii. 6,] ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَا لَكُمُ<br>\
الكَرَّةَ عَلَيْهِمْ [Then we gave to you the turn to<br>\
prevail against them; the victory over them].<br>\
(Bd, Jel.)<br>\
كُرَّى: see كَرَّةٌ.<br>\
كَرِيرٌ, an inf. n.: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, A hoarseness<br>\
or roughness of the voice, occasioned by dust. (K.)<br>\
كَرَّارٌ: see مِكَرٌّ.<br>\
كِرْكِرَةٌ The callosity, or callous protuberance,<br>\
upon the breast of the camel, (رَحَى زَوْرِ البَعِيرِ,<br>\
S, K,) which, when the animal lies down, touches<br>\
[and rests] upon the ground, projecting from his<br>\
body, like a cake of bread; (TA;) it is one of<br>\
the five ثَفِنَات [of which there is one at each<br>\
knee and one at each stifle-joint]: (S, TA:) or<br>\
the breast of any animal of which the foot is of<br>\
the kind called خُفّ: (K:) pl. كَرَاكِرُ. (TA.)<br>\
حَزُّ الكَرَاكِرِ [lit. The incision of the كراكر] is<br>\
when a camel has a disease, so that he is not<br>\
even when he lies down upon his breast; in<br>\
consequence of which, a vein is gently drawn<br>\
forth from the كركرة, and then he [or it] is<br>\
cauterized. Hence the following, in a trad. of<br>\
Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr:<br>\
عَطَاؤُكُمُ لِلضَّارِبِينَ رِقَابَكُمْ<br>\
وَنُدْعَى إِذَا مَا كَانَ حَزُّ ا@لْكَرَاكِرِ<br>\
[Your bounty is for those who smite your necks,<br>\
and we are invited when there is a difficult undertaking to be accomplished, like the incision of<br>\
the كراكر:] meaning, ye invite us only when<br>\
ye are distressed, because of our skill in war;<br>\
and on occasions of bounty, and ampleness of the<br>\
means or circumstances of life, others. (IAth.)<br>\
مَكَرٌّ A place of war or fighting [where the combatants return time after time to the conflict,<br>\
wheeling away and then turning back]. (S)<br>\
مِكَرٌّ One who returns often [to the fight, after<br>\
wheeling away, or retiring, or being put to flight];<br>\
as also ↓ كَرَّارٌ. (K) ―<br>\
-b2-  فَرَسٌ مِكَرٌّ A horse that<br>\
is suitable, or fit, for returning to the fight, and<br>\
for charging, or assaulting. (S.) And فَرَسٌ<br>\
مِكَرٌّ مِفَرٌّ A horse well trained, willing, and active,<br>\
ready to return to the fight and to flee. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  نَاقَةٌ مِكَرَّةٌ A she-camel that is milked twice<br>\
every day. (A, Sgh, K.)<br>\
مُكَرَّرٌ [Repeated; reiterated]. ―<br>\
-b2-  المُكَرَّرُ The<br>\
letter ر: (K:) because of the faltering of the<br>\
tip of the tongue which is observable when one<br>\
pauses after uttering it, occasioned by the reiteration with which that is done; wherefore,<br>\
with respect to إِمَالَة, [as an obstacle thereto,]<br>\
it is reckoned as two letters. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [مُكَرَّرٌ,<br>\
in the present day, also signifies Refined, as an<br>\
epithet applied to sugar, &amp;c.]<br>\
