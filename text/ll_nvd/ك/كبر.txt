كَبُرَ, aor.<br>\
كَبُرَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. كُبْرٌ<br>\
(A, Msb, K) and كِبَرٌ and كَبَارَةٌ, (A, K,) He,<br>\
(TA,) or it, (Msb,) was, or became, great, [big,<br>\
or large in body, or corporeal substance: and<br>\
in years, or age; (when said of a human being,<br>\
often particularly signifying he attained to puberty;) and in estimation or rank or dignity;]<br>\
contr. of ضَغُرَ; (A, K;) syn. عَظُمَ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
and جَسُمَ. (K.) [In the K the pret. is twice<br>\
mentioned: where it is explained as signifying<br>\
the contr. of صَغُرَ, the above inf. ns. are mentioned, as in the A: where it is explained by<br>\
عَظُمَ and جَسُمَ in the K, no inf. n. is mentioned;<br>\
but in the TA it is there said that in the sense<br>\
of عَظُمَ it relates to an affair or case, and that<br>\
the inf. n. is كِبَرٌ and كَبَارَةٌ; and that in the<br>\
sense of جَسُمَ it relates to anything.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
كَبُرَ الأَمْرُ [The affair, or case, was, or became,<br>\
of great moment; it was, or became, momentous:<br>\
or it signifies as in the phrase next following].<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  كَبُرَ عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرُ The affair, or case, was,<br>\
or became, difficult, hard, severe, grievous, distressing, afflictive, troublesome, or burdensome, to<br>\
him or in its effect upon him; syn. شَقَّ. (A, *<br>\
TA.) In this sense the verb is used in the Kur,<br>\
x, 72, (TA,) and xlii, 11. (Bd, ii. 42.) And<br>\
so in the Kur again, xvii, 53, أَوْ خَلْقًا مِمَّا<br>\
يَكْبُرُ فِى صدُورِكُمْ, (TA,) meaning, أَوْخَلْقًا مِمَّا<br>\
يَكْبُرُ عِنْدَكُمْ عَنْ قُبُولِ الحَيَاةِ [Or a created thing<br>\
of those which are too difficult in your minds to<br>\
receive life], as being the thing most remote from<br>\
capability to receive life. (Bd.) [This signification is from the primary application of the verb.]<br>\
-A2-  كَبِرَ, aor.<br>\
كَبَرَ, inf. n. كِبَرٌ and مَكْبِرٌ, He (a<br>\
man, S, a human being, and a beast, TA, and a<br>\
child, Msb,) became full-grown, or old, or<br>\
advanced in age. (S, K.) Hence the prov.,<br>\
كَبِرَ عَمْرُو عَنِ الطَّوْقِ: see art. طوق.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [In<br>\
modern Arabic, and, I believe, sometimes, in<br>\
classic authors, it also signifies He became big;<br>\
(said of a boy, or child, in the TA in art. رع, &amp;c.;)<br>\
i. e. attained to full growth: and to adolescence:<br>\
and to puberty: see كَبِيرٌ.] This form of the<br>\
verb and that first mentioned are sometimes<br>\
erroneously used, each for the other, by persons<br>\
of distinction as well as by the vulgar. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  See كَبْرَةٌ, below.<br>\
-A3-  كَابَرْتُهُ فَكَبَرْتُهُ, aor. of<br>\
the latter,<br>\
كَبُرَ: see 3. ―<br>\
-b2-  كَبَرَهُ بِسَنَةٍ, aor.<br>\
كَبُرَ, He<br>\
exceeded me in age by a year. (K.) And<br>\
مَا كَبَرَنِى إِلَّا بِسَنَةٍ He did not exceed me in age<br>\
save by a year. (IAar.)<br>\
2<br>\
كبّر, inf. n. تكَبِيرٌ, He made a thing great.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He magnified, or honoured; syn. عَظَّمَ.<br>\
(S) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, inf. n. as above, and كِبَّارٌ, (Sgh,<br>\
K,) which latter is of the dial. of Belhárith Ibn-Kaab and many of the people of El-Yemen,<br>\
(Sgh,) He said اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَر. (K.) See أَكْبَرُ,<br>\
below.<br>\
3<br>\
كَابَرْتُهُ فَكَبَرْتُهُ, aor. of the latter<br>\
كَبُرَ, [I contended, or disputed, with him for superiority in<br>\
greatness, and I overcame him therein.] (A.)<br>\
You say كَابَرَ فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا Such a one disputed with<br>\
such a one for superiority in greatness, and said<br>\
I am greater than thou. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  كابرهُ, inf. n.<br>\
مُكَابَرَةٌ, He vied with him; or contended with him<br>\
for superiority; syn. غَالَبَهُ: and he contended<br>\
against him; or he contended against him, or<br>\
disputed with him, not knowing the truth or<br>\
falsity of what he or his adversary said; syn.<br>\
عَانَدَهُ: (Msb:) or he contended or disputed with<br>\
him, knowing that what he himself said was false,<br>\
and that what his adversary said was true.<br>\
(Kull, p. 342.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is said in a trad., لَاتُكَابِرُوا<br>\
الصَّلَاةَ, meaning, لَا تُغَالِبُوهَا [app., Contend not ye<br>\
against prayer.] (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  كُوبِرَ فَأَبَى [It was<br>\
contended with, and refused, or would not]: said<br>\
of what he would utter by a man who had an<br>\
impediment in his speech. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  كَابَرَهُ عَلَى<br>\
حَقِّهِ He denied, or disacknowledged, to him his<br>\
right, or due, and contended with him for it;<br>\
expl. by جَاحَدَهُ وَغَالَبَهُ. (A, TA. [See 1 in art.<br>\
جحد.]) ―<br>\
-b6-  كُوبِرَ عَلَى مَالِهِ He had his property<br>\
taken from him by force. (A, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اكبرهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِكْبَارٌ; (Msb;)<br>\
and ↓ استكبرهُ; (K;) He deemed it great [or<br>\
formidable; see an ex., voce فَظِعَ;] it was great<br>\
in his estimation; (IJ, K;) syn. إِسْتَعْظَمَهُ.<br>\
(S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اكبرت She brought forth a great<br>\
child, or young one. (IKtt.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَصْغَرَتِ النَّاقَةُ<br>\
وَأَكْبَرَتْ: see art. صغر.<br>\
5<br>\
تكبّر and ↓ استكبر (S, K) and ↓ تكابر (K)<br>\
He magnified himself; behaved proudly, haughtily,<br>\
or insolently; (K;) syn. تَعَظَّمَ: (S:) or تكبّر<br>\
signifies, as used in the Kur, vii. 143, he considered himself as of the most excellent of the<br>\
creation, and as having rights which others have<br>\
not: (Zj:) or this verb has two significations:<br>\
one of them, he did really good and great actions,<br>\
exceeding the good actions of others; and hence<br>\
المُتَكَبِّرُ [applied to God] in the Kur, lix. 23: the<br>\
other, he affected to do such actions, and boasted<br>\
of great qualities which he did not possess; as do<br>\
the generality of men; and hence, مُتَكَبِّر in the<br>\
Kur, xl. 37; and the verb itself in the Kur,<br>\
vii. 143: and ↓ استكبر is nearly syn. with تكبّر,<br>\
and likewise has two significations: one of them,<br>\
he endeavoured, and sought, to become great;<br>\
and to do so, when the manner and place and<br>\
time are such as are requisite, is praiseworthy:<br>\
the other, he boasted of qualities which he did<br>\
possess, and feigned such qualities; and to do so<br>\
is blameable; and in this sense the verb is used<br>\
in the Kur, ii. 32: (El-Basáïr:) and ↓ تكابر<br>\
signifies he feigned himself great in estimation or<br>\
rank or dignity, or in age. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
تكبّر عَلَى ا@للّٰهِ He magnified himself against God,<br>\
by refusing to accept the truth. (El-Basáïr.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[تكبّر عَنْ كَذَا He was disdainful of such a thing;<br>\
he disdained it; turned from it with disdain;<br>\
he held himself above it; like تَعَظَّمَ and تَعَاظَمَ<br>\
and تَجَالَّ and تَرَفَّعَ.]<br>\

-A2-  see also 5, in two places.<br>\
كُبْرٌ: see كِبْرٌ, in two senses:<br>\
-A2-  and<br>\
see كِبْرَةٌ in three places.<br>\
كِبْرٌ Greatness [in corporeal substance, and in<br>\
estimation or rank or dignity]. (IKoot, Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Nobility; eminence; highness; (K, * TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ كُبْرٌ: (K:) eminence, or highness, in, or<br>\
with respect to, nobility; (K;) as also ↓ كُبُرٌ,<br>\
with two dammehs. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  I. q. عَظَمَةٌ [which,<br>\
as an attribute of God, signifies greatness, or<br>\
majesty, or the like: (see مُنَكَبِّرٌ:) and as an<br>\
attribute of a man, pride]: (S, Msb, K:) a subst.<br>\
from التَّكَبُّرُ: (Msb:) as also ↓ كِبْرِيَآءُ; (S, Msb,<br>\
K;) a word, says Kr, of which there is not the<br>\
like [in measure], except سِيمِيَآءُ and جِرْبِيَآءُ; for,<br>\
he adds, as to كِيمِيَآءُ, I think it a foreign word:<br>\
(TA:) the latter [↓ كِبْرِيَاءُ] occurs as an attribute<br>\
of God, in the sense of عَظَمَةٌ, (A, Mgh, Jel,)<br>\
in the Kur, xlv. 36: (Jel:) and as an attribute of men, in the Kur, x. 79, where it is said to<br>\
signify proud behaviour towards others, (Bd,) or<br>\
dominion: (IAmb, Bd, Jel:) and both signify<br>\
pride, haughtiness, or insolence: (K:) or the<br>\
former, self-admiration, or self-conceit; and the<br>\
holding one&#39;s self greater than others: and the<br>\
↓ latter, disdain of submission; an attribute to<br>\
which none but God has a right. (El-Basáïr.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Unbelief: the association of any other being<br>\
with God. So in a trad., in which it is said,<br>\
that he who has in his heart the weight of a<br>\
grain of mustard-seed of كِبْر shall not enter<br>\
paradise. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also كَبِيرَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  The main,<br>\
or greater, or greatest, part of a thing; (Fr.<br>\
ISk, Az, S, Mgh, K;) as also ↓ كُبْرٌ, (Fr, Mgh,<br>\
Sgh, K,) like عُظْمٌ; (Fr;) thought by Ibn-ElYezeedee to be a dial. form; but Az says, that<br>\
the Arabs used the other form [كِبْرٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
So in the Kur, xxiv. 11, وَا@لَّذِى تَوَلَّى كِبْرَهُ (Fr,<br>\
S) And he who took upon himself, or undertook,<br>\
the main part thereof; namely, of the very<br>\
wicked lie against &#39;Áïsheh: (Jel:) thus accord.<br>\
to the “ Seven Readers ”: and ↓ كُبْرَهُ, which is<br>\
an extr. reading, (Msb,) the reading of Homeyd<br>\
Ibn-El-Aaraj, (Fr, Sgh,) and of Yaakoob.<br>\
(Sgh, Bd.) كُبْرُ سِيَاسَةِ النَّاسِ فِى المَالِ, [app.<br>\
signifies The main part of men&#39;s management is<br>\
with respect to property, or camels, &amp;c.]. (S.)<br>\
كَبَرٌ [The caper, or capparis of Linnæus;]<br>\
a certain plant having thorns; (TA;) an arabicized word, from the Persian [كَبَرْ]; (S;) called<br>\
in Arabic لَصَفٌ, (Mgh,) or أَصَفٌ: (S, K:) the<br>\
vulgar say ↓ كُبَّارٌ. (K.) A beverage is described<br>\
as made of كَبَر and barley: كثر is a mistranscription. (Mgh.)<br>\
كُبُرٌ: see كِبْرٌ.<br>\
كِبَرٌ inf. n. of 1: ―<br>\
-b2-  see also كَبْرَةٌ.<br>\
كُبُرٌّ: see كِبْرَةٌ.<br>\
كَبْرَةٌ, a subst. from كَبِرَ, (S,) Oldness; age;<br>\
old age; (S, Msb, K; *) as also ↓ كَبُرَةٌ and<br>\
↓ مَكْبَرَةٌ and ↓ مَكبُرَةٌ (K) and ↓ مَكْبِرٌ (S, K) and<br>\
↓ كِبَرٌ. (TA.) The last two, the latter of<br>\
which is the most common of all, are inf. ns. of<br>\
كَبِرَ.] You say عَلَتْهُ كَبُرَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) and<br>\
كَبُرَةٌ, and مُكْبَرَةٌ, and مَكْبُرَةٌ, (K,) and عَلَاهُ المَكْبِرُ,<br>\
(S,) or مَكْبِرٌ, (K,) and كِبَرٌ, (TA,) [Age overcame him;] he became old, or advanced in age.<br>\
(Msb.) عَلَتْهُ كَبْرَةٌ is also said, tropically, of a<br>\
sword, and of the iron head or blade of a weapon,<br>\
when it has become old: (TA:) or of an old<br>\
iron head or blade of a weapon when spoilt by<br>\
rust. (M, TA.) And كَبْرَةٌ is used by AHn<br>\
with respect to dates and the like. (L.) [See<br>\
also an ex. voce حَلْقَةٌ.]<br>\
كِبْرَةٌ: see كَبِيرَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  هُوَ كِبْرَتُهُمْ, (K,) and<br>\
↓ كُبُرَّتُهُمْ, (Az, K,) so in the handwriting of<br>\
AHeyth., (TA,) and ↓ إِكْبِرَّتُهُمْ, and ↓ أَكْبِرَّتُهُمْ,<br>\
and ↓ كُبْرُهُمْ, and ↓ كُبُرُّهُمْ, (K,) He is the<br>\
greatest of them (K, TA) in age, or in headship:<br>\
(TA:) or he is the nearest of them in kin to his<br>\
chief, or oldest, ancestor; (K, TA;) his intermediate ancestors being fewer in number: (TA:)<br>\
but some of these epithets are differently explained, as follows:] هٰذَا كِبْرَةُ أَبِيهِ this is the<br>\
greatest, or oldest, (أَكْبَرُ,) of the children of his<br>\
father; contr. of صِغْرَةُ أَبِيهِ: (A:) and هُوَ كِبْرَةُ<br>\
وَلَدِ أَبَوَيْهِ he is the greatest, or oldest, (اكبر,) of<br>\
the children of his parents: (Ks, Az:) or he is the<br>\
last of the children of his parents; (Sh, S;) and<br>\
the like is said of a female, (Sh, ISk, S,) and of a<br>\
pl. number: (ISk, S:) it is like عِجْزَةُ وَلَدِ أَبَوَيْهِ:<br>\
(Sh, A&#39;Obeyd, S:) or, accord. to Ks and Az,<br>\
this last phrase has this meaning; but Az says,<br>\
that كِبْرَة means otherwise, namely, أَكْبَرُ:<br>\
(TA:) and فُلَانٌ إِكْبِرَّةُ قَوْمِهِ such a one is the<br>\
greatest, or oldest, (أَكْبَرُ,) of his people; and<br>\
the like is said of a female, and of a pl. number:<br>\
(S:) and قَوْمِهِ ↓ هُوَ كُبْرُ, (S,) or قَوْمِهِ ↓ أَكْبَرُ, and<br>\
قَوْمِهِ ↓ أُكْبُرُّ, of the measure of أُفْعُلّ, and applied<br>\
to a woman as to a man, (TA,) he is the nearest<br>\
of his people in kin to his chief, or oldest, ancestor;<br>\
(S, TA;) in which sense, قَوْمِهِ ↓ كَانَ كُبْرَ is<br>\
said of El-&#39;Abbás, in a trad., because there<br>\
remained not, in his lifetime, any one of the<br>\
descendants of Háshim more nearly related to<br>\
him than he: (L:) and in another trad. it is<br>\
said, الَولآءُ للكُبْرِ (S, Mgh, Msb) the right to the<br>\
inheritance of the property left by an emancipated<br>\
slave belongs to the nearest in kin [to the<br>\
emancipater] (Mgh, Msb) of the sons of the<br>\
emancipater; (Mgh;) i. e., when a man [who<br>\
has emancipated a slave] dies, leaving a son and<br>\
a grandson, the right to the inheritance of the<br>\
property left by the emancipated slave belongs to<br>\
the son, not the grandson. (S.)<br>\

كِبْرِيتٌ: see art. كبرت.<br>\
كُبَارٌ: see كَبِيرٌ.<br>\
كَبِيرٌ Great [in body, or corporeal substance,<br>\
and in estimation or rank or dignity; contr. of<br>\
صَغِيرٌ, but see عَظِيمٌ]; (S, K;) as also كِبِيرٌ, as<br>\
asserted by En-Nawawee and others, (TA,) and<br>\
↓ كُبَارٌ (S, K) [in an intensive sense, like عُطَامٌ,]<br>\
and ↓ كَابِرٌ and ↓ كُبَّارٌ: (K:) or the last signifies<br>\
excessively great: (S, TA:) and كَابِرٌ is an epithat applied to a man, and signifying great in<br>\
dignity and nobility; (S, TA;) or great and<br>\
noble; (Msb;) or one overcoming in greatness;<br>\
(A;) or a lord, or chief; and the greatest, or<br>\
oldest, ancestor: (AA:) the fem. [of كَبِيرٌ] is<br>\
with ة: (K:) and the pl. is كِبَارٌ (S, K) and<br>\
كُبَرَآءُ, applied to men, (TA,) and مَكْبُورَآءُ, (S, * K,)<br>\
[or rather the last is a quasi-pl. n.,] like مَشْيُوخَآءُ;<br>\
[see شَيْخٌ;] (TA;) and [of كُبَّارٌ] كُبَّارُونَ. (K.)<br>\
[See also أَكْبَرُ, and مُتَكَبِّرٌ.] You say تَوَارَثُوا<br>\
↓ ا@لْمَجْدَ كَابِرًا عَنْ كَابِرٍ They inherited by degrees<br>\
dignity, or nobility, one great in dignity and<br>\
nobility from another great in dignity and<br>\
nobility: (S:) or one great and noble from<br>\
another great and noble: (Msb:) or عَنْ is here<br>\
used in the sense of بَعْدَ [after]: (TA voce طَبَقٌ:)<br>\
or one overcoming in greatness from another overcoming in greatness. (A.) [In the A and Msb,<br>\
instead of توارثوا, I find وَرِثُوا.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Great, or<br>\
advanced, in age; old: (A, Msb, TA:) and<br>\
also big; meaning full-grown; and adolescent:<br>\
(see كَبِرَ:) occurring in apposition to بَالِغٌ in art.<br>\
برك in the S; and often, like بَالِغٌ, when applied<br>\
to a human being, signifying one who has<br>\
attained to puberty; opposed to صَغِيرٌ:] fem.<br>\
with ة: and pl. كِبَارٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] A<br>\
teacher, and master: so in the Kur, xx. 74, and<br>\
xxvi. 48: (Ks:) and the most knowing, or learned,<br>\
of a people: so in the Kur, xii. 80. (Mujáhid.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Difficult, severe, grievous, distressing, afflictive,<br>\
troublesome, or burdensome: (TA:) fem. with ة;<br>\
occurring in this sense in the Kur, ii. 42. (Bd,<br>\
TA.) [The fem. is often used in the present<br>\
day as an epithet in which the quality of a<br>\
subst. predominates, meaning, An affair, or a<br>\
matter, that is difficult, severe, grievous, &amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
الكَبِيرُ as an epithet applied to God is syn. with<br>\
العَظِيمُ [signifying The Incomparably-great].<br>\
(TA in art. عظم.)<br>\
كَبِيرَة A foul, or an abominable, sin, or crime,<br>\
or offence, forbidden by the law, of great magnitude; such as murder and adultery or forni-<br>\
cation, and fleeing from an army proceeding<br>\
against an enemy [of the Muslims], &amp;c.; [contr.<br>\
of صَغِيرَةٌ;] an epithet in which the quality of a<br>\
subst. predominates: (TA:) and ↓ كِبْرٌ and<br>\
↓ كِبْرَةٌ [in like manner] signify a great sin, or<br>\
crime, or offence, for which one deserves punishment: (M, K:) the ة is to give intensiveness<br>\
to the signification: (TA:) or ↓ كِبْرٌ signifies<br>\
[simply] a sin, a crime, or an offence, for which<br>\
one deserves punishment, [as كَبِيرَةٌ is said, not<br>\
well, to signify, in the Msb,] and is from<br>\
كَبِيرَةٌ, like خِطْ from خَطِيْئَةٌ: (TA:) pl. of the<br>\
first, كَبَائِرُ, (Msb, TA,) and كَبِيرَاتٌ also<br>\
occurs. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And see كَبِيرٌ.<br>\

-A2-  and see كَبَرٌ.<br>\
كِبَّارٌ: see 2.<br>\
كَابِرٌ: see كَبِيرٌ.<br>\
أَكْبَرُ [Greater, and greatest, in body, or corporeal substance, and in estimation or rank or<br>\
dignity: and] more, or most, advanced in age;<br>\
older, and oldest: (Msb:) fem. كُبْرَى: (S,<br>\
Msb:) pl. masc. أَكَابِرُ (S, Msb) and أَكْبَرُونَ;<br>\
but not كُبْرٌ, because this is of a form specially<br>\
appropriated to an epithet such as أَسْوَدُ and أَحْمَرُ,<br>\
and you do not use اكبر in the manner of such<br>\
an epithet, for you do not say هٰذَا رَجُلٌ أَكْبَرُ,<br>\
unless you conjoin it with a following word by<br>\
مِنْ, or prefix to it the article ال: (S:) [but see<br>\
the phrase دَعَا بِكُبْرِهِ, below:] the pl. fem. is كُبَرٌ<br>\
(S, Msb, K) and كُبْرَيَاتٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَكْبَرُ is<br>\
also used in the sense of كَبِيرٌ: (Msb:) accord.<br>\
to some, اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَر means God is great; (Az,<br>\
Mgh, Msb;) like as هُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ [in the Kur,<br>\
xxx. 26,] means هُوَ هَيِّنٌ عَلَيْهِ; (Az, TA;) but<br>\
this explanation is of weak authority: (Mgh:)<br>\
accord. to others, the phrase is elliptical, and<br>\
means God is the greatest great [being]: (Az,<br>\
TA:) or God is greater than every [other] great<br>\
[being]: (Msb:) or greater than every [other]<br>\
thing: (Mgh, TA:) or greater than such as<br>\
that one knows the measure of His majesty:<br>\
(TA:) [or it may be rendered God is most great,<br>\
meaning, greater than any other being:] it is<br>\
considered as elliptical because it is necessary<br>\
that اكبر should have the article ال, or be<br>\
followed by a noun in the gen. case [or by the<br>\
prep. مِنْ]. (TA.) In the phrase اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ كَبِيراً,<br>\
the word كبيرا is put in the accus. case [as a<br>\
corroborative] in the place of the inf. n. تَكْبِيراً,<br>\
as though one said أُكَبِّرُ تَكْبِيرًا [I magnify Him<br>\
greatly, after saying اللّٰه اكبر]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
يَوْمُ الحَجِّ الأَكْبَرِ [The day of the greater pilgrimage,] means the day of the sacrifice: or, as<br>\
some say, the day of &#39;Arafeh: and others say<br>\
otherwise. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  In the following words,<br>\
in a trad. of Mázin, بُعِثَ نَبِىٌّ مِنْ مُضَرَ بِدِينِ ا@للّٰهِ<br>\
الكُبَرِ, there is an ellipsis, and the meaning is,<br>\
بِشَرَئِعِ دِينِ ا@للّٰهِ الكُبَرِ [A prophet of Mudar hath<br>\
