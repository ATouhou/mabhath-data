load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'كأسكَأْسٌ, (ISk, S, A, Msb, K,) and كَاسٌ,<br>\
with the ء suppressed, is allowable, (Msb,)<br>\
and sometimes occurs, (TA,) A drinking-cup:<br>\
(A, K:) or [a cup of wine; i. e.] a cup containing<br>\
wine; (S, A, K;) or a cup full of wine: (Msb:)<br>\
when not containing wine, it is not thus called;<br>\
(IAar, S, Msb;) being in this case called قَدَحٌ:<br>\
(TA:) or it has the first and the second of these<br>\
significations: (TA:) or it signifies wine itself:<br>\
(As, AHát, Ibn-&#39;Abbád:) or has this signification also: (K:) and is of the fem. gender:<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K:) pl. [of pauc.] أَكْؤُسٌ and [of<br>\
mult.] كُؤُوسٌ and كِئَاسٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the last<br>\
with ء, (TA, [but written without ء in the CK,])<br>\
and, accord. to AHn, كِيَاسٌ, without ء, which,<br>\
if correct, is originally كِوَاسٌ, from كَاسٌ, with<br>\
the ء changed into ا as representing و, (TA,) and<br>\
كَاسَاتٌ, (K,) without ء. (TA.) It is used<br>\
metaphorically in relation to every kind of disagreeable, hateful, or evil, things. Thus you say,<br>\
سَقَاهُ كَأْسًا مِنَ الذُّلِّ (tropical:)  [He gave him to drink a<br>\
cup of abasement]: and مِنَ الفُرْقَةِ (tropical:)  [of separation]: and مِنَ المَوْتِ (tropical:)  [of death]: and مِنَ<br>\
الحُبِّ (tropical:)  [of love]. (TA.) You say also, سَقَاهُ<br>\
الكَأْسَ الأَمَرَّ (tropical:)  [He gave him to drink the most<br>\
bitter cup]; meaning death: (A, TA:) and<br>\
كُؤُوسَ المَنَايَا (tropical:)  [The cups of death; lit., deaths].<br>\
(A.) Az. thinks that it may be derived from<br>\
كَاصَ فُلَانٌ مِنَ الطَّعَامِ وَالشَّرَابِ, meaning, “ Such<br>\
a one ate and drank much ”; because ص and س<br>\
are interchangeable in many words on account<br>\
of the nearness of their places of utterance.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
