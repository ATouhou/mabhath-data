تَلَدٌ: see تِلَادٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and تَلِيدٌ.<br>\
تِلَادٌ, applied to مَال [i. e. property, consisting<br>\
of camels or the like], (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) Old, or<br>\
long-possessed; as also ↓ تَالِدٌ and ↓ تَلِيدٌ, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) both of these meaning old, original, property, (A,) and ↓ مُتْلَدٌ: (L:) or original, old, or<br>\
long-possessed, born at one&#39;s own abode, or home;<br>\

↓ مُتْلَدٌ;]) (M, K; [written in a copy of the M<br>\
مُتَلّد;]) wherefore, [i. e. because of the meaning,]<br>\
Yaakoob judges that the ت is a substitute for و;<br>\
[as is said to be the case in the S;] but this is<br>\
not a valid decision; for, were it so, the word in<br>\
some of its variations would be reduced to its<br>\
original: (M:) or any old, or long-possessed,<br>\
property, (T, M, L,) consisting of animals &amp;c.,<br>\
(M, L,) inherited from parents; (T, M, L;) as<br>\
also ↓ تَالِدٌ (T, L) and ↓ تَلِيدٌ and ↓ مُتْلَدٌ (T, M, L<br>\
[the last written in a copy of the T مٌتْلِدٌ, and in<br>\

beasts, that breed at one&#39;s own abode, or home,<br>\

by Sh:) or that which you yourself breed, or<br>\
rear. (As, T.) [See also تَلِيدٌ, below. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,]<br>\
هُنَّ مِنْ تِلَادِى, said by a man, (namely, Ibn-Mes&#39;ood, M,) in reference to certain chapters<br>\
(سُوَر) of the Kur-án, meaning (tropical:)  They are of<br>\
those which I acquired (or learned, L) long ago<br>\
from the Kur-án: (S, M, L:) thus saying, he<br>\
likened them to the property, or camels &amp;c.,<br>\
called تِلَادٌ. (M, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Az says,] I heard a man<br>\
of Mekkeh say, تِلَادِىبِمَكَّةَ, i. e. مِيلَادِى [app.<br>\
meaning My birth was in Mekkeh]. (T.)<br>\
تَلِيدٌ: see تِلَادٌ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also That<br>\
which is born at the abode, or home, of another<br>\
than thyself, and which, while young, thou afterwards purchasest, and which remains with thee:<br>\
(As, T.) or one who is born in a foreign country,<br>\
and is carried away while young to the territory<br>\
of the Arabs: (Mgh:) or one who is born in a<br>\
foreign country, and then brought away while<br>\
young, and who grows up in the territory of the<br>\
Muslims; (S, K;) as also ↓ تَلَدٌ: (K:) or i. q.<br>\
مُوَلَّدٌ and مُوَلَّدَةٌ, [masc. and fem.,] meaning one<br>\
that is born at thine own abode, or home: (ISh,<br>\
T: [see also تِلَادٌ:]) or one who has parents<br>\
at thine own abode, or home; whereas مُوَلَّدٌ signifies one who has only one parent there: (Mgh,<br>\
from the Tekmileh [of the &#39;Eyn]:) the fem. is<br>\
with ة; (S;) signifying a female slave who is<br>\
born in a foreign country, and is carried away,<br>\
and grows up in the territory of the Arabs: (Kt,<br>\
T:) or a female slave whose father and family<br>\
and all her relations are in one country and who<br>\
is herself in another: (ISh, L in art. ولد:) or a<br>\
female slave born the property of a people with<br>\
whom are her parents: (L in art. ولد:) or a<br>\
female slave inherited by her owner; if born at<br>\
his own abode, or home, [of a mother already<br>\
belonging to him,] she is called وَلِيدَةٌ: (T, L:)<br>\
you say رَجُلٌ تَلِيدٌ; pl. تُلَدَآءُ: and اِمْرَأَةٌ تَلِيدٌ [and<br>\
تَلِيدَةٌ]; pl. تَلَائِدُ (Lh, M, L) and تُلُدٌ. (Lh, L.)<br>\
It is related in a trad. of Shureyh, that a man<br>\
purchased a female slave, and the two parties<br>\
made it a condition that she should be a مُوَلَّدَة;<br>\
but the purchaser found her to be a تَلِيدَة, and<br>\
therefore returned her: (S, Mgh:) a مُوَلَّدَة is<br>\
like a تِلَاد, i. e. born at thine own abode, or<br>\
home; (S;) or born in the territory of the Muslims. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, metaphorically, (tropical:)  A child,<br>\
absolutely. (Har p. 317.)<br>\

-b2-  تَالِدٌ بَالِدٌ: see<br>\

places.<br>\
مُتْلَدٌ, applied to مَال, (S, Msb,) pass. part. n.<br>\
of 4: (Msb:) see تِلَادٌ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] خُلُقٌ مُتْلَدٌ, (M, L, TA,) in the K, مُتَلَّدٌ,<br>\
said to be like مُعَظَّمٌ, but this is a mistake, (TA,)<br>\
[and in the CK, خَلْقٌ is erroneously put for خُلُقٌ,]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  An old, or a long-possessed, natural disposition,<br>\
or quality. (M, L, K.) IAar cites as an ex. this<br>\
verse:<br>\
مَا ذَا رُزِينَا مِنْكِ أَمَّ مَعْبَدِ<br>\
مِنْ سَعَةِ الحِلْمِ وَ خُلْقٍ مُتْلَد<br>\
[app. meaning What has been experienced from<br>\
us, on thy part, Umm-Maabad, of largeness of<br>\
forbearance, and of long-possessed good natural<br>\
dispositions, or qualities? رُزِينَا seems to be here<br>\
used for رُزِئْنَا; or the latter may be the correct<br>\
reading]. (M, L.)<br>\
مُتْلِدٌ [act. part. n. of 4:] A possessor of property such as is termed تِلَاد: and hence, ―<br>\
-b2-  A<br>\
first owner or proprietor; as the weaver of a<br>\
piece of cloth, and the man who delivers his she-camel [and is owner of her young one]. (Mgh.)<br>\
