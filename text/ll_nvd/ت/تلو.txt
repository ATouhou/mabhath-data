and so تَلَيْتُهُ; (K;) and ↓ تَلَّيْتُهُ, (As, * T, * K,)<br>\
inf. n. تَتْلِيَةٌ. (K.) The phrase, in the Kur xci. 2,<br>\
وَالقَمَرِ إِذَا تَلَاهَا means By the moon when its rising<br>\
follows the rising thereof; i. e., the rising of the<br>\
sun; at the beginning of the lunar month: (Bd:)<br>\
or, when it follows in rising the setting thereof,<br>\
(Bd, Jel,) on the night of the full moon: (Bd:)<br>\
or, when it follows it in becoming round, and in<br>\
fullness of light; (M, * Bd;) i. e., when it follows<br>\
it in the way of imitation, and in respect of rank;<br>\
for the moon borrows its light of the sun, and is<br>\
to it in the place of a successor. (Er-Rághib.)<br>\
Here, Ks pronounced تلاها with imáleh, [either<br>\
because تَلَيْتُ is a dial. var. of تَلَوْتُ, or] because,<br>\
although it has و for its last radical letter, it<br>\
occurs with words that may be so pronounced,<br>\
namely, يَغْشَاهَا and بَنَاهَا. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تَلَوْتُ الأِبِلَ<br>\

S, * M,) and did according to it; (I&#39;Ab, Mujáhid,<br>\
T;) namely, the Scripture: (I&#39;Ab, Mujáhid,<br>\
T, M:) or the inf. n. specially signifies the following God&#39;s revealed Scriptures, sometimes by<br>\
reading, or perusing, or by reciting, and sometimes by conforming therewith [as well as by<br>\
reading, &amp;c., but not otherwise, for] every تِلَاوَة<br>\
is قِرَآءَة, but the reverse is not the case. (Er-Rághib, TA.) [You say also, تَلَا عَلَيْهِ He recited,<br>\
or related, to him a narrative &amp;c.: see Kur v. 30,<br>\
&amp;c.] And فُلَانٌ يَتْلُو عَلَى فُلَانٍ, and يَقُولُ عَلَيْهِ,<br>\
Such a one lies, or says what is false, against such<br>\
a one. (TA.) وَاتَّبَعُوا مَا تَتْلُوالشَّيَاطِينُ, in the<br>\
Kur ii. 96, means [And they followed] what the<br>\
devils related, or rehearsed, (&#39;Atà, T,) or spoke;<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, T;) or, what the devils of the Jinn,<br>\
or of mankind, or of both, read, or recited, or<br>\
what they followed, of the writings of enchantment: (Bd:) some here read ↓ تُتَلِّى. (T.) Hence<br>\
the saying, لَا دَرَيْتَ وَلَا تَلَيْتَ: (T:) or, accord.<br>\
to Yoo, it is ↓ ولا أَتْلَيْتَ: (T, S:) and others say<br>\
that it is ولا ائْتَلَيْتَ, from أَلَوْتُ. (T. [See these<br>\
three readings explained in the latter part of the<br>\
first paragraph of art. الو.])<br>\
-A2-  He remained behind, or held back. (IAar, ISk, T.) You say,<br>\

the young one of a mule. (IAar, T, K.)<br>\

4<br>\
أَتْلَيْتُهُ إِيَّاهُ I made him to follow him; or, it<br>\
to follow it. (M, K.) Hence, (TA,) اتلاهُ اللّٰهُ<br>\
أَطْفَالًا God made him, or may God make him,<br>\

And أَتْلَتْ She (a camel) had her young one<br>\

دَرَيْتَ وَلَا أَتْلَيْتَ; accord. to Yoo: (S:) but see 1,<br>\

a reference to the explanations. ―<br>\

ذِمَّةً He gave him a bond, or an obligation, whereby<br>\
he became responsible for his safety: (S, K:)<br>\

i. e. ذِمَّةً, (K,) or جِوَارًا, (M, K,) and meaning<br>\
