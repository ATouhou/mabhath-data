تَرَكَهُ, (S, M, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
تَرُكَ, (S, M,)<br>\
inf. n. تَرْكٌ (S, M, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ترْكَانٌ, with<br>\
kesr, (Fr, K,) He left it, forsook it, relinquished<br>\
it, abandoned it, deserted it, or quitted it; either<br>\
intentionally, and by choice, or by constraint, and<br>\
of necessity: (Er-Rághib, TA:) he left it, forsook it, &amp;c., as above; namely, a thing that he<br>\
desired, or wished for, and also a thing that he<br>\
did not desire, or did not wish for: (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh,<br>\
TA:) he left it, quitted it, went away from it, or<br>\
departed from it; namely, a place: and he left<br>\
him, forsook him, relinquished him, abandoned<br>\
him, deserted him, quitted him, or separated himself from him: (Msb:) he cast it, or threw it,<br>\
away, as a thing of no account; rejected it; discarded it; cast it off; left it off: (MF, TA:)<br>\
he left it, left it alone, let it alone; ceased, desisted,<br>\
forbore, or abstained, from it; neglected it, omitted<br>\
it, or left it undone; syn. خَلَّاهُ; (S, A, O;) or<br>\
وَدَعَهُ; (M, K;) as also ↓ اتّركهُ. (K. [But respecting this latter verb, see what follows.]) وَاتْرُكِ<br>\
البَحْرَ رَهْوًا, in the Kur xliv. 23, And leave thou<br>\
the sea opened with a wide interval; or motionless,<br>\
in the same state as before thy passing through it,<br>\
and strike it not with thy rod, nor alter anything<br>\
thereof; (Bd;) or motionless, parted asunder;<br>\
(Jel;) so that the Egyptians may enter it; (Bd,<br>\
Jel;) is an instance of the verb meaning leaving<br>\
intentionally, and by choice: (Er-Rághib, TA:)<br>\
and كَمْ تَرَكُوا مِنْ جَنَّاتٍ وَعُيُونٍ, in the next verse,<br>\
How many gardens and springs did they leave!<br>\
(Jel,) is an instance of the verb meaning leaving<br>\
by constraint, and of necessity. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
In a phrase such as تَرَكَ حَقَّهُ, meaning He made<br>\
his right, or due, or claim, to be null, or he rejected<br>\
it, and such as تَرَكَ رَكْعَةٌ مِنَ الصَّلَاةِ, meaning<br>\
He neglected, omitted, or left unperformed, a<br>\
ركعة, of the prayer, [it is said (but I think it<br>\
doubtful) that] the verb, having an ideal substantive for its objective complement, is used metaphorically. (Msb.) ↓ قَالَ فِيهِ فَمَا اتَّرَكَ means مَا<br>\
تَرَكَ شَيْئًا [i. e. He strove, laboured, or exerted<br>\
himself, (اِجْتَهَدَ,) in it, and neglected not, or<br>\
omitted not, anything in his power]: the verb is<br>\
of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ. (S.) مَنْ أَوْصَى بِالثُّلُثِ وَلَمْ<br>\
شَيْئًا ↓ يَتَّرِكْ is a mistake for ولم يَتْرُكْ شَيْئًا, or ولم<br>\
↓ يَتَّرِكْ without شَيْئًا, or فَمَا اتَّرَكَ; for this verb is<br>\
not trans., except, sometimes, in poetry; and the<br>\
meaning is, وَلَمْ يَتْرُكْ فِيمَاأُذِنَ لَهُ فِيهِ شَيْئًا [i. e. He<br>\
who bequeaths the third of his property, and does<br>\
not omit anything of what he is allowed (to leave,<br>\
or anything of the third part, for this is all that<br>\
he is allowed to bequeath)]: it is from the saying<br>\
↓ فَعَلَ فَمَا اتَّرَكَ [He did such a thing, and neglected<br>\
not, or omitted not, anything]. (Mgh.) You say<br>\
also, تَرَكَ المَيِّتُ مَالًا, i. e. The deceased left property. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَتَرَكْنَا عَلَيْهِ فِى الآخِرِينَ, (K,)<br>\
in the Kur [xxxvii. 76 &amp;c.], (TA,) means And<br>\
we have perpetuated (K, Jel, TA) to him a eulogy<br>\
among the later generations (Jel, TA) of the<br>\
prophets and peoples to the day of resurrection,<br>\
[namely,] Salutation &amp;c. (Jel.) ―<br>\
-b3-  التَّرْكُ is also<br>\
syn. with الجَعْلُ, (Lth, K, TA,) in some instances;<br>\
(Lth, TA;) as though it had two contr. significations: (K:) [i. e.,] when تَرَكَ is doubly trans., it<br>\
has the meaning of صَيَّرَ, (MF, TA,) or جَعَلَ.<br>\
(TA.) So in the saying, تَرَكْتُ الحَبْلَ شَدِيدًا I<br>\
made, or rendered, the rope strong; or made it,<br>\
or caused it, to be, or become, strong. (TA.) So<br>\
too in the Kur ii. 16, وَتَرَكَهُمْ فِى ظُلُمَاتٍ And<br>\
maketh, or causeth, them to be in darknesses.<br>\
(Ksh, Bd, MF.) And sometimes one says of any<br>\
action that has come at last to a certain state,<br>\
مَا تَرَكْتُهُ كَذَا [I did not make it, or cause it, to<br>\
be thus]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  تَرِكَ, aor.<br>\
تَرَكَ, (IAar, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَرْكٌ, (TK,) He (a man, IAar) married, i. e.<br>\
took to wife, a تَرِيكَة, (IAar, K,) meaning a<br>\
woman that had remained a virgin, unmarried,<br>\
until she had become of middle age, or long after<br>\
she had attained to puberty, in the house, or tent,<br>\
of her parents. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
تاركهُ [inf. n. مُتَارَكَةٌ] is syn. with خَالَاهُ (S<br>\
in art. خلو) [which is explained in the K, in art.<br>\
خلو, as syn. with تَرَكَهُ, He left, forsook, relinquished, abandoned, &amp;c., him or it; and thus it<br>\
may often be well rendered: but it properly signifies he left him, forsook him, &amp;c., being left,<br>\
&amp;c., by him; whence it is said in the Mgh, in<br>\
art. ودع, that مُوَادَعَةُ is syn. with مُصَالَحَةٌ because<br>\
it is مُتَارَكَةٌ: Golius, as on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof, explains تاركهُ as signifying he dismissed<br>\
him, and did not molest him: he left him unmolested is one of its meanings, but is not the<br>\
primary signification: accord. to the TK, متاركة<br>\
signifies the leaving, &amp;c., anything in the state in<br>\
which it is: and the leaving, &amp;c., one another].<br>\
One says also, تَارَكْتُهُ البَيْعَ, (S, Mgh, but in the<br>\
latter تَارَكَهُ, and in the TA فِى البَيْعِ,) وَغَيْرَهُ,<br>\
(Mgh,) inf. n. مُتَارَكَةٌ, (S,) [app. meaning I<br>\
relinquished with him, i. e. concurrently with him,<br>\
the sale, &amp;c.: see 6, by which this rendering is<br>\
confirmed: Golius, as on the authority of J, who<br>\
has not explained it, says that it means I relinquished to him the merchandise, or commodity;<br>\
and Freytag follows him.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] مُتَارَكَةٌ is<br>\
metonymically used as meaning The making peace<br>\
[or a truce], or reconciling oneself, with another<br>\
or others. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  In the saying, لَا بَارَكَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
فِيِهِ وَلَا تَارَكَ وَلَا دَارَكَ, it is an imitative sequent,<br>\
(K,) all of these verbs having the same meaning<br>\
[so that the saying may be rendered May God<br>\
not bless him nor felicitate him nor make him<br>\
happy]: (TA:) [or the meaning may be, nor<br>\
preserve him, or prolong his life; for] IAar says<br>\
that تَارَكَ means أَبْقَى. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَتَارَكُوا الأَمْرَ بَيْنَهُمْ, (K,) or الأَمْرَ فِيمَا بَيْنَهُمْ,<br>\
(Mgh,) They relinquished [concurrently], one<br>\
with another, the affair that was between them.<br>\
(TK.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِتَّرَكَ: see 1, in five places.<br>\
تَرْكٌ: see تَرِيكَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also A [drinking-cup or<br>\
bowl such as is called] قَدَح which a man lifts, or<br>\
carries, with his two hands. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA.)<br>\
التُّرْكُ A certain nation; (S, Msb, K;) [namely,<br>\
the Turks:] تُرْكِىٌّ is its n. un.: (Msb, TA:)<br>\
[and signifies also Turkish:] pl. أَتْرَاكٌ. (Msb,<br>\
K.) It is said in a trad., اُتْرُكُوا التَّرْكَ مَا تَرَكُو كُمْ<br>\
[Leave ye alone the Turks as long as they leave<br>\
you alone]. (TA.) [تُرْكِىُّ الوَجْهِ often occurs<br>\
in post-classical works as meaning Having a<br>\
Turkish face; i. e. round-faced, or broad-faced;<br>\
opposed to عَرَبِىُّ الوَجْهِ.]<br>\
تَرْكَةٌ: see تَرِيكَةٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
woman such as is termed رَبْعَةٌ [i. e. of middling<br>\
stature]: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K:) pl. تَرْكَاتٌ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  It is said in a trad., جَآءَ الخَلِيلُ إِلَى مَكَّةَ يُطَالِعُ<br>\
تَرْكَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [El-Khaleel (i. e. Abraham) came to<br>\
Mekkeh to get knowledge of his تركة], meaning<br>\
Hagar, and her son Ishmael: (K:) the word<br>\
originally means an ostrich&#39;s egg, and is here<br>\
used metaphorically; for the ostrich lays but one<br>\
egg in the year, and then leaves it and goes<br>\
away: (TA:) Z says, in the Fáïk, that it is thus<br>\
related, with the ر quiescent; (Nh, O, TA;) but<br>\
it would be a proper way if it were with kesr<br>\
to the ر [↓ تَرِكَتَهُ,] as meaning the thing that<br>\
he had left, or forsaken, &amp;c. (Nh, O, K.)<br>\
تِرْكَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
تَرِكَةٌ A thing that is left, forsaken, relinquished,<br>\
abandoned, deserted, or quitted; like طَلِبَةٌ meaning “ a thing desired, or sought; ” (TA;) see<br>\
also تَرْكَةٌ: particularly, the inheritance, or property that is left, of a person deceased; (S,<br>\
Msb, K; *) also pronounced ↓ تِرْكَةٌ: pl. تَرِكَاتٌ.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
تَرَاكِ an imperative verbal noun, meaning اُتْرُكْ<br>\
[Leave thou, &amp;c.]. (S, TA.) Hence the saying,<br>\
تَرَاكِ تَرَاكِ صُحْبَةَ الأَتْرَاكِ [Leave thou, leave thou,<br>\
the companionship of the Turks]. (TA.) Yoo<br>\
says that تَرَاكَ is a dial. var. of the same; but<br>\
this is only when it is used as a prefixed noun,<br>\
as in تَرَاكَهَا for تَرَاكِهَا. (TA.)<br>\
تَرِيكٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
تَرِيكَةٌ A woman that is left unmarried; (S,<br>\
K;) that has remained a virgin, unmarried,<br>\
until she has become of middle age, or long after<br>\
she has attained to puberty, in the house, or tent,<br>\
of her parents: (TA:) it is not applied to a<br>\
male: (Lh, TA:) pl. تَرَائِكُ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A meadow<br>\
the depasturing of which has been neglected: (S,<br>\
K:) or a pasture-land where people have pastured<br>\
their beasts, either in a desert or upon a mountain, and of which the beasts have eaten until<br>\
there remain [only] some relics of wood. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Water left by a torrent: (IB, K:) used in<br>\
this sense by El-Farezdak. (IB.) ―<br>\
-b4-  An egg after<br>\
the young bird has gone forth from it: (K:) or<br>\
an ostrich&#39;s egg (S, K) which she forsakes (S, TA)<br>\
in the desert after it has become empty: (TA:)<br>\
or, as some say, an ostrich&#39;s eggs left solitary:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ تَرْكَةٌ signifies the same. (K.) [For<br>\
the pl., see the next sentence.] ―<br>\
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  An iron<br>\
helmet; (K;) in the opinion of ISd, as being<br>\
likened to the egg thus termed; (TA;) and so<br>\
↓ تَرْكَةٌ: (S, K:) the pl. [of the former] is تَرَائِكُ<br>\
[mentioned in the S as pl. of the former applied<br>\
to an ostrich&#39;s egg] and ↓ تَرِيكٌ and ↓ تَرْكٌ [the<br>\
latter of which is termed in the S pl. of تَرْكَةٌ are<br>\
coll. gen. ns. of which تَرِيكَةٌ and تَرْكَةٌ are the<br>\
ns. un.]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  A raceme of dates (كِبَاسَة [in<br>\
the CK, erroneously, كُناسة]) after it has had<br>\
what was upon it shaken off, (AHn, K, TA,)<br>\
and is left: pl. تَرَائِكُ: (AHn, TA:) and ↓ تَرِيكٌ<br>\
signifies a raceme (عُنْقٌود) when what was upon<br>\
it has been eaten; (AHn, K, TA;) and a raceme<br>\
of dates (عِذْق) that has had what was upon it<br>\
shaken off, (K, TA,) so that nothing remains<br>\
upon it: so AHn says in one place. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  It<br>\
is said in a trad., إِنَّ لِلّهِ تَرَائِكَ فِى خَلْقِهِ, meaning<br>\
[Verily to God are referrible] conditions which<br>\
He hath perpetuated in mankind, of hope and<br>\
heedlessness, so that they apply themselves thereby<br>\
with boldness, forwardness, presumptuousness, or<br>\
arrogance, to the things of the present world.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

&amp;c. ―<br>\
-b2- ] In lexicology, Obsolete. (Mz 10th نوع.)<br>\
التُّرْكُمَانُ<br>\
ترما [The Turkumán;] a certain people,<br>\
or race, of the Turks; [absurdly said to be] so<br>\
called because two hundred thousand of them<br>\
became believers in one month; wherefore they<br>\
said لَا تَرَمَا [the Turks of belief]; which was<br>\
afterwards contracted into تُرْكُمَانٌ: (K, TA:) [a<br>\
coll. gen. n.: n. un., and rel. n., تُرْكُمَانِىٌّ:] pl.<br>\
تَرَاكِمَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
