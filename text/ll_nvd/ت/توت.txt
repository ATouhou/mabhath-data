(Mgh, and L and K in art. توث, q. v.;) the latter<br>\
sometimes used; (Msb;) or this is not allowable;<br>\
(ISk, T, S, Msb;) for the word, which is app.<br>\
Persian, is pronounced by the Arabs with ت for<br>\
the final as well as for the initial letter; (T, Msb;)<br>\
[The mulberry; and especially the white mulberry;] i. q. فِرْصَادٌ: (ISk, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K:)<br>\
or, accord. to the people of El-Basrah, (Msb,) or<br>\
some of the people of El-Basrah, (Mgh,) توت is<br>\
the name of the fruit, and فرصاد is that of the<br>\
tree; (Mgh, Msb;) and this is what is commonly<br>\
held: (Msb:) or, accord. to IDrd and others,<br>\
توت is an arabicized word, and فرصاد is the<br>\
Arabic name: (TA:) [توت is a coll. gen. n.:]<br>\
the n. un. is with ة. (M.) [Golius says, in his<br>\
Lex., on the authority of Zeyn El-&#39; Attár, that<br>\
there are three kinds: “ توت حلو,” i. e. حُلْوٌ,<br>\
“ the sweet and white mulberry, peculiarly called<br>\
فرصاد; and توت حامض,” i. e. حَامِضٌ, ““ the sour<br>\
and black mulberry; and توت وحشى,” i. e.<br>\
وَحْشِىٌّ, “and توت العليق,” i. e. العُلَّيْقٌ, “the wild<br>\
mulberry, i. e., with red fruit. ” In Egypt, توت<br>\
is applied to the sweet mulberry, white and black,<br>\
and especially to the former, as also توت بَلَدِىّ;<br>\
and توت شَامِىّ to the latter. In the present day,<br>\
توت العُلَّيْق is applied to the raspberry; as also<br>\
توت شَوْكِىّ: and توت وَحْشِىّ, I believe, to the<br>\
blackberry. توت أَرْضِىّ and توت إِفْرَنْجِىّ are<br>\
applied to the strawberry.]<br>\
تُوتِيَآءٌ, [of the masc. gender, as is shown by the<br>\
phrase توتياء مَعْدَنِىٌّ, and therefore perfectly decl.,]<br>\
an arabicized word, (S, Msb,) [Tutia, or tutty;<br>\
an impure protoxide of zinc;] a certain stone [or<br>\
mineral], (S, K,) well known, (M, K,) employed<br>\
as a collyrium. (S, Msb.) [It is also applied in<br>\
the present day to several kinds of vitriol; the<br>\
sulphates of zinc and of copper and of iron. De<br>\
Sacy says, on the authority of Ibn-Beytár, that<br>\
there are two species thereof; one which is found<br>\
in mines; the other, in the furnaces in which<br>\
copper is melted, like cadmia; and this latter<br>\
species is what the Greeks call pompholyx: of<br>\
the fossil tutia there are three varieties; one is<br>\
white; another, greenish; the third, yellow, with<br>\
a strong tinge of red: the white is the finest<br>\
variety; the green, the coarsest. (Chrest. Arabe,<br>\
2nd ed., iii. 453; where see more.) Golius, on<br>\
this word, in his Lex., says, “Optima est quæ vel<br>\
naturalis, sc. Indica, cærulea, et pellucida; vel<br>\
artificialis, sc. Carmanica, alba cum partis viridioris strictura. Zein. ” i. e. Zeyn El-&#39; Attár. “ Ex<br>\
plumbi præstantissimi, quod dicitur قلعى, fuligine<br>\
concrescere præstantissimum genus, commune vero<br>\
ex fuligine æris, tradit Jacutus ex Abulfed. ”.]<br>\
