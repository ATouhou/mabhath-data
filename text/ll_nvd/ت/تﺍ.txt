load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'تاتَا fem. of ذَا; (M;) i. q. ذِهْ [This and that];<br>\
(T;) a noun of indication, denoting that which is<br>\
female or feminine; like ذَا (S, K) applied to that<br>\
which is male or masculine; (S;) and you say<br>\
also تِهْ, like ذِهْ: (S, K:) the dual is تَانِ: and<br>\
the pl., أُولَآءِ. (S, K.) En-Nábighah [Edh-Dhubyánee] says, (T, S,) excusing himself to En-Noamán [Aboo-Káboos], whom he had satirized,<br>\
(TA,)<br>\
هَا إِنَّ تَا عِذْرَةٌ إِنْ لَمْ تَكُنْ نَفَعَتْ<br>\
فَإِنَّ صَاحِبَهَا قَدْ تَاهَ فِى البَلَدِ<br>\
[Now verily this is an excuse: if it profit not,<br>\
then verily its author has lost his way in the<br>\
desert, or in the waterless desert]: (T, S: but in<br>\
the latter, لا is put in the place of لم:) تا here<br>\
points to the قَصِيدَة [or ode]; and عذرة is a subst<br>\
from اِعْتِذَارٌ; and تاه means تَحَيَّرَ; and البلد<br>\
means المَفَازَة. (TA.) The dim. of تَا is تَيَّا, (T,<br>\
S, M, K,) which is anomalous, like ذَيَّا the dim.<br>\
of ذَا, &amp;c. (I&#39;Ak p. 343. [Much has been written<br>\
respecting the formation of this dim. to reduce<br>\
it to something like rule, but I pass it over as,<br>\
in my opinion, unprofitable and unsatisfactory;<br>\
and only refer to what is said respecting the<br>\
duals أُلَيَّا and أُلَيَّآءِ in art. الى. See an ex. voce<br>\
مِرَّةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  هَا is prefixed to it (T, S, K) [as an inceptive particle] to give notice of what is about to<br>\
be said, (S,) so that one says هَاتَا [meaning This],<br>\
(T, S, K,) as in هَاتَا فُلَانَةُ [This is such a woman];<br>\
(T;) and [in the dual] هَاتَانِ; and [in the pl.]<br>\
هٰؤُلَآءِ: and the dim. is هَاتَيَّا. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  When you<br>\
use it in addressing another person, you add to<br>\
it ك [as a particle of allocution], and say تَاكَ (S,<br>\
K) and تِيكَ and تِلْكَ (T, S, K) and تَلْكَ, which<br>\
is a bad dial. var., (S, K,) and تَالِكَ, (T, S,) which<br>\
is the worst of these: (T:) [all meaning That:]<br>\
the dual is تَانِكَ and تَانِّكَ, the latter with tesh-deed, (S, K, [but in some copies of the S, only<br>\
the latter is mentioned,]) and تَالِكَ [which, like<br>\
تَانِّكَ, is dual of تِلْكَ or تَلْكَ, which are contractions of تَالِكَ; these two duals being for تَانِلِكَ,<br>\
the original, but unused, form]: (K:) the pl. is<br>\
أُولٰئِكَ [or أُولَآئِكَ] and أُولَاكَ and أُولَالِكَ [respecting all of which see أُلَى, in art. الى]: (S, K:)<br>\
and the dim. is تَيَّاكَ and تَيَّالِكَ: (K: [in the TA,<br>\
the latter is erroneously written تَيّانِكَ:]) the ك<br>\
relates to the person or persons whom you address,<br>\
masc. and fem. and dual and pl.: [but in addressing a female, you may say تَاكِ &amp;c.; in addressing<br>\
two persons, تَاكُمَا &amp;c.; in addressing more than<br>\
two males, تَاكُمْ &amp;c.; and in addressing more<br>\
than two females, تَاكُنَّ &amp;c.:] what precedes the<br>\
ك relates to the person [or thing] indicated, masc.<br>\
and fem. and dual and pl. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  هَا is also<br>\
prefixed to تِيكَ and تَاكَ, so that one says, هَاتِيكَ<br>\
هِنْدُ and هَاتَاكَ هِنْدُ [This, or that, is Hind]. (S,<br>\
K. *) Abu-n-Nejm says,<br>\
جِئْنَا نُحَيِّيكَ وَنَسْتَجْدِيكَا<br>\
فَافْعَلْ بِنَا هَاتَاكَ أَوْ هَاتِيكَا<br>\
meaning [We have come saluting thee and seeking<br>\
of thee a gift: then do thou to us] this or that:<br>\
[give us] a salutation or a gift. (S.) The هَا that<br>\
is used to give notice of what is about to be said<br>\
is not prefixed to تلك because the ل is made a<br>\
substitute for that ها: (S, TA:) or, as IB says,<br>\
they do not prefix that ها to ذٰلِكَ and تِلْكَ because<br>\
the ل denotes the remoteness of that which is<br>\
indicated and the ها denotes its nearness, so that<br>\
the two are incompatible. (TA.)<br>\
