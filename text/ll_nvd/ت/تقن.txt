تَقَّنُوا أَرْضَهُمْ, (JK, K,) inf. n. تَتْقِينَ, (K,)<br>\
They watered their land with thick, or muddy,<br>\
water, [or water containing تِقْن,] (JK, * K,) in<br>\
order that it might become good. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اتقنهُ, (K,) inf. n. إِتْقَانٌ, (JK, S,) i. q. أَحْكَمَهُ<br>\
[He made it, or rendered it, (namely, a thing,<br>\
JK, or an affair, S and K,) firm, stable, strong,<br>\
solid, compact, sound, or free from defect or imperfection, by the exercise of skill; he made it<br>\
firmly, strongly, solidly, compactly, so that it<br>\
was firmly and closely joined or knit together,<br>\
soundly, thoroughly, skilfully, judiciously, or well;<br>\
he so constructed, constituted, established, settled,<br>\
arranged, did, performed, or executed, it; he put<br>\
it into a firm, solid, sound, or good, state, or on a<br>\
firm, solid, sound, or good, footing]. (JK, S,<br>\
K.) [And اتقن لَهُ signifies the same as اتقنهُ: or<br>\
he exercised, or possessed, the skill requisite for it;<br>\
namely, an affair.] الَّذِي أَتْقَنَ كُلَّ شَّىْءٍ, in the<br>\
Kur xxvii. 90, means Who hath created everything firmly, strongly, solidly, &amp;c., (أَحْكَمَ خَلْقَهُ,)<br>\
and made it, fashioned it, or disposed it, in the<br>\
fit, proper, or right, manner. (Bd.) [You say<br>\
also, اتقن عِلْمَهُ, meaning He made his knowledge<br>\
sound; or made himself thoroughly learned.] And<br>\
اتقن عَنْهُ He knew it, or learned it, (namely, a<br>\
tradition [&amp;c.],) soundly, thoroughly, or well,<br>\
from him. (TA in art. ذبر.)<br>\
تِقْنٌ The رُسَابَة of water, (JK, Mgh, K,) in a<br>\
rivulet or in the channel of a torrent, (K,) in the<br>\
[season called] رَبِيع; (Lth, JK, Mgh;) i. e.,<br>\
(Mgh,) [its sediment, or] the thick matter that<br>\
is borne by it [and that sinks to the bottom; used<br>\
for improving land]: (Lth, JK, Mgh:) and (K)<br>\
the تُرْنُوق of a well (Mgh, K) and of the channel<br>\
of a torrent; i. e., the slime, mixed with black,<br>\
or black and fetid, mud; accord. to the Jámi&#39; of<br>\
El-Ghooree. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A thing by means of<br>\
which one subsists, and makes good, or improves,<br>\
the performance, or execution, or management, of<br>\
an affair; as iron, and other things, of the جَوَاهِر<br>\
[i. e. precious stones, or native ores,] of the earth:<br>\
and anything by means of which a thing is made<br>\
good, or improved, is called its تِقْن. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
A skilful man: (JK, S, K:) pl. أَتْقَانٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
[Hence, probably,] تِقْنٌ [or اِبْنُ تِقْنٍ] is also the<br>\
name [or surname] of a certain man proverbial<br>\
for his excellence in shooting. (S, K. [In the<br>\
latter it is implied that this name or surname is<br>\
التِّقْنُ.]) The rájiz says,<br>\
يَرَمِى بِهَا أَرْمَى مِنِ ابْنِ تِقْنِ<br>\
[One more skilled in shooting than Ibn-Tikn<br>\
shoots it]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Nature, or natural disposition.<br>\
(JK, S, K.) You say, الفَصَاحَةُ مِنْ تِقْنِهِ Chasteness of speech, or eloquence, is [a quality] of his<br>\
nature. (S.)<br>\
Quasi تقى: or, accord. to some, تقو<br>\
1<br>\
تَقَى, aor.<br>\
1َ2ِ3َ (T, S, K, in art. وقى) and<br>\
1َ2َ3َ,<br>\
(T, TA,) or تَقِىَ, aor.<br>\
1َ2َ3َ, (Msb, [but the correctness of this I greatly doubt, unless, as appears to<br>\
be the case, it is meant to be understood as an<br>\
intrans. verb,]) inf. n. تَقْىٌ, (S and TA in art.<br>\
تقى, [which art. I find in only one copy of the<br>\
S,]) or تُقًى, (K,) or تُقَاةٌ, (Msb, and also mentioned in the TA,) of which تُقًى is pl., or coll. n.,<br>\
(Kzz, IB, Msb,) and تَقِيَّةٌ (K) and تِقَآءٌ; (Lh,<br>\
K;) and ↓ اِتَقَّى, (T, S, Msb, K,) inf. n. اِتِّقَآءٌ<br>\
(Msb) and [quasi-inf. n.] تَقِيَّةٌ and تُقَاةٌ; (S, art.<br>\
وقى;) He feared God: (S and TA in art. تقى:<br>\
all else that follows is from art. وقى except where<br>\
reference is made to another art.:) or he was<br>\
cautious of a thing; guarded, or was on his<br>\
guard, against it; prepared, prepared himself,<br>\
or was in a state of preparation, against it; or<br>\
feared it: (K:) or he looked forward to a thing,<br>\
and guarded against it, sought to avoid it, or<br>\
was cautious of it. (T, TA.) [For other explanations of the latter verb, which apply also to the<br>\
former, see art. وقى.] ↓ اِتَّقَى is originally اِوْتَقَى;<br>\
(T, S;) then اِيتَقَى; then اِتَّقَى; and when this<br>\
came to be much in use, they imagined the ت<br>\
to be a radical part of the word, and made the<br>\
word اِتَقَى, aor. يَتَقِى, with fet-h to the ت in each<br>\
case, and without teshdeed; and not finding any<br>\
analogue to it in their language, they said تَقَى,<br>\
aor. يَتْقِى, like قَضَى, aor. يَقْضِى: (S:) or, as is<br>\
said in the T, they suppressed the ت, and the اِتَّقَى<br>\
changed into ت, in اِتَّقَى, and said تَقَى, aor.<br>\
يَتْقِى. (TA.) A poet says, (namely, Khufáf Ibn-Nudbeh, TA,)<br>\
جَلَاهَا الصَّيْقَلُونَ فَأَخْلَصُوهَا<br>\
خِفَافًا كُلُّهَا يَتْقِى بِأَثْرِ<br>\
or, as some read it, يَتَقِى, with the ت movent,<br>\
but without teshdeed; (S;) and this latter, accord.<br>\
to IB, is the right reading. (TA.) [See this verse<br>\
explained in art. اثر.] IB adds that Aboo-Sa&#39;eed<br>\
[app. meaning As] disallowed تَقَى, aor. يَتْقِى,<br>\
inf. n. تَقْىٌ; saying that it would require the imperative to be اِتْقِ, which is not said; and this,<br>\
he states, is right: [for] J says that the imperative used is تَقِ [Fear thou, or beware thou, &amp;c.],<br>\
as in تَقِ اللّٰهِ [Fear thou God]; and to a woman,<br>\
تَقِى; formed from the verb اِتَقَى, without tesh-deed, by the suppression of the ا. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
مَا اَتْقَاهُ لِلّٰهِ (S, TA) How great is his reverential, or pious, fear of God! (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ما اتقاهُ is<br>\
also said of a saddle, as meaning How good is it<br>\
for not galling the back! (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِ1ْتَ2َ3َ see 1, in two places; and see also art. وقى.<br>\
تُقًى: see تَقْوَى.<br>\
تُقَاةٌ: see تَقْوَى, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  In the phrase<br>\
in the Kur [iii. 27], إِلَّا أَنْ تَتَّقُوا مِنْهُمْ تُقَاةً, it may<br>\
be an inf. n. [so that the meaning may be Unless<br>\
ye fear from them with a great fearing (see 1)]:<br>\
or it may be a pl. [app. of تَقِىٌّ, like as كُمَاةٌ is<br>\
pl. of كَمِىٌّ, so that the meaning may be unless<br>\
ye fear from them, being fearful]: but it is better<br>\
to regard it as an inf. n. because another reading<br>\
is تَقِيَّةً. (M, TA.)<br>\
تَقِىٌّ, applied to a man, (Msb, K, TA,) i. q.<br>\
وَقِىٌّ (TA) and مُتَّقٍ (S) [Fearing; cautious; &amp;c.:<br>\
(see 1:) and particularly having a reverential, or<br>\
pious, fear of God: or simply pious: or one who<br>\
preserves, or guards, himself, accord. to some,<br>\
exceedingly, or extraordinarily, from sin, either of<br>\
commission or of omission: (see 8 in art. وقى:)]<br>\
accord. to IDrd, one who preserves, or guards,<br>\
himself from punishment [in the world to come],<br>\
and from acts of disobedience, by righteous conduct: from وَقَيْتُ نَفْسِى: said by the grammarians<br>\
to be originally وَقُوىٌ; then, تَقُوىٌ: or, accord.<br>\
to Aboo-Bekr, [originally] of the measure فَعِيلٌ,<br>\
as is indicated by the first of its pls. mentioned<br>\
below: but he who says that it is [originally] of<br>\
the measure فَعُولٌ says that it has that pl. because<br>\
it has become like a word [originally] of the<br>\
measure فَعِيلٌ: (TA:) or righteous, virtuous,<br>\
just, or honest; (Msb in art. تقى;) contr. of<br>\
فَاجِرٌ: (idem in art. بر:) pl. أَتْقِيَآءُ (Msb in art.<br>\
تقى, and K) and تُقَوَآءُ, (K,) which is extr., and<br>\
of a class disallowed by Sb, (TA,) [and app. also<br>\
تُقَاةٌ, q. v. suprà.]<br>\
تَقِيَّةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
تَقْوَى, or تَقْوًى, accord. to different readings in<br>\
the Kur ix. 110, (Bd,) [of which readings the<br>\
former is the more common,] is originally تَقْيَا,<br>\
(K,) [or تَقْيًا,] or [rather وَقْيَا, or وَقْيًا, and then]<br>\
وَقْوَى, of the measure فَعْلَى, from وَقَيْتُ, (ISd,<br>\
TA,) or, accord. to MF, the right opinion is that<br>\
it is [وَقْوًى,] of the measure فَعْوَلٌ, (TA,) and is<br>\
thus transformed in order to make a distinction<br>\
between the subst. and the epithet such as خَزْيَا<br>\
and صَدْيَا: (K:) it is a subst. from اِتَّقَى or وَقَى;<br>\
(Msb, K;) [and signifies Fear; caution; &amp;c.:<br>\
(see 1:) and particularly reverential, or pious,<br>\
fear of God: or simply piety: or the preservation, or guarding, of oneself, accord. to some,<br>\
exceedingly, or extraordinarily, from sin, either<br>\
of commission or of omission: or the preservation,<br>\
or guarding, of oneself from punishment in the<br>\
world to come, and from acts of disobedience, by<br>\
righteous conduct: or righteousness, virtue, justice,<br>\
or honesty: (see تَقِىٌّ:) its explanations in relation<br>\
to religion are many and various, but are all resolvable into fear of God, or of sin; or the preservation, or guarding, of oneself from sin:] and<br>\
↓ تَقِيَّةٌ and ↓ تُقَاةٌ are syn. with each other (S) and<br>\
with تَقْوَي, (Msb,) and are used as inf. ns. of<br>\
اِتَّقَى: (S:) and ↓ تُقًى [also] is syn. with تَقْوَي;<br>\
(S;) or it is pl. of ↓ تُقَاةٌ, or a coll. n., (Kzz, IB,<br>\
Msb,) like as طُلًى is of طُلَاةٌ, (Kzz, IB,) and<br>\
as رُطَبٌ is of رُطَبَةٌ. (Msb.) وَآتَاهُمْ تَقْوَاهُمْ, in<br>\
the Kur xlvii. 19, means And hath explained to<br>\
them, (Bd,) or suggested to them, (Jel, TA,) what<br>\
they should fear, or that from which they should<br>\
preserve themselves: (Bd, Jel, TA:) or hath aided<br>\
them to practise their تَقْوَى: (Bd:) or hath given<br>\
them the recompense of their تقوى. (Bd, TA.)<br>\
And هُوَ أَهْلُ التَّقْوَى, in the Kur lxxiv. last verse,<br>\
means He is entitled, or worthy, to be feared;<br>\
or to be reverentially, or piously, feared. (Bd,<br>\
Jel, K.)<br>\
هُوَ أَتْقَى مِنْ فُلَانٍ [He is more fearing, or<br>\
cautious, &amp;c., than such a one; more reverentially, or piously, fearful of God; or more pious;<br>\
&amp;c.;] he has more تَقْوَى than such a one. (TA.)<br>\
