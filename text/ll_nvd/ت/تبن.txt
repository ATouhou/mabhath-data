nice, or minute, in inspection; as also طَبَانَهٌ;<br>\
accord. to AO and AA: (T:) these two words<br>\
signify the same (T, S, M *) accord. to [most of]<br>\
the leading authorities: (T:) and Yaakoob asserts<br>\
that the ت is a substitute for ط: (M:) [or the<br>\
reverse seems to be the case in the opinion of Az,<br>\
who here remarks that there are many instances<br>\
of the change of ت into ط:] or the former is in<br>\
evil; and the latter, in good: (M:) or, accord. to<br>\
Lth, طَبِنَ means in evil; and تَبِنَ, in good; so<br>\
that he makes طبانة to be in deceiving, or beguiling, and suddenly, or unexpectedly, attacking<br>\
