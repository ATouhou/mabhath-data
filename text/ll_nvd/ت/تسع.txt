تَسَعَ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
تَسِعَ (Yoo, Msb,<br>\
K) and<br>\
تَسُعَ, (Msb,) inf. n. تَسْعٌ, (T K,) He took<br>\
the ninth part of their possessions: or he became<br>\
the ninth of them: (S, Msb, K:) or he made<br>\
them to be nine with himself; (K;) they having<br>\
before been eight. (TA.) [See also 2.]<br>\
2<br>\
تسّعهُ He made it nine. (Esh-Sheybánee,<br>\
and K voce وَحَّدَ.) [See also 1.] ―<br>\
-b2-  تسّع لِامْرَأَتِهِ,<br>\
or عِنْدَهَا, He remained nine nights with his wife:<br>\
and in like manner the verb is used in relation to<br>\
any saying or action. (TA voce سَبَّعَ.)<br>\
4<br>\
اتسعوا They became nine: (S, K:) and they<br>\
became ninety. (M and L in art. ثلث.) ―<br>\
-b2-  They<br>\
were, or became, persons whose camels came to<br>\
water [on the ninth day, counting the day of the<br>\
next preceding watering as the first; i. e.,] after<br>\
an interval of nine days, [of which the first or<br>\
last, or each of these, was not complete,] and eight<br>\
nights. (S, * K, * TA.)<br>\
تَسْعٌ: see تِسْعَةٌ.<br>\
تُسْعٌ A ninth part; one of nine parts; (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) as also ↓ تُسُعٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ تَسِيعٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) agreeably with a rule which some hold<br>\
to be applicable in the case of every similar fractional number; but Sh says, I have not heard<br>\
تَسِيعٌ on any authority but that of AZ. (TA.)<br>\
تِسْعٌ fem. of تِسْعَةٌ, q. v. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A certain ظْمء<br>\
of the أَظْمَآء of camels; (S, K, TA;) i. e., their<br>\
coming to water [on the ninth day, counting the<br>\
day of the next preceding watering as the first;<br>\
or, in other words,] after an interval of nine days,<br>\
[of which the first or last, or each of these, is not<br>\
complete,] and eight nights. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The<br>\
ninth young one, or offspring. (A in art. ثلث.)<br>\
تُسَعٌ The seventh and eighth and ninth nights<br>\
of the [lunar] month; (K;) the three nights of<br>\
the month which are after the نُفَل, because the<br>\
last night of these is the ninth; (S;) among the<br>\
nights of the month are three called غُرَرٌ, [pl. of<br>\
غُرَّةٌ,] and after these are three called نُفَلٌ, and<br>\
after these are three called تُسَعٌ because the last of<br>\
them is the ninth night: (Az, TA:) or the three<br>\
nights of the commencement of the month, as some<br>\
say; but the first of these explanations is more<br>\
agreeable with analogy. (TA.)<br>\
تُسُعٌ: see تُسْعٌ.<br>\
تِسْعَةٌ, applied to denote a number, [namely<br>\
Nine,] is masc. ; and ↓ تِسْعٌ, so applied, is fem.:<br>\
(S:) the latter is also written ↓ تَسْعٌ, with fet-h to<br>\
the ت; and is thus pronounced in the Kur<br>\
xxxviii. 22, (Bd, MF,) accord. to one reading.<br>\
(Bd.) You say تِسْعَةُ رِجَالٍ [Nine men], and تِسْعٌ<br>\
نِسْوَةٍ [Nine women]. (K.) When it means the<br>\
things numbered, not the amount of the number,<br>\
تسعة is imperf. decl., being regarded as a proper<br>\
name: thus you say, تِسْعَةُ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ ثَمَانِيَةَ [Nine<br>\
things are more than eight things]. (TA.) It is<br>\
said in the Kur [xvii. 103], وَ لَقَدْ آتَيْنَا مُوسَى تِسْعَ آيَاتٍ<br>\
بَيِّنَاتٍ [And we formerly gave unto Moses nine evident signs; generally understood to mean the principal miracles which he was empowered to perform,<br>\
and which are differently enumerated in the K<br>\
and other works; but by some supposed to mean<br>\
statutes]. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ, which is<br>\
masc., and تِسْعَ عَشْرَةَ, which is fem., [each signifying Nineteen,] each of the two words ends with<br>\
fet-h in every case, because they are two nouns<br>\
which are regarded as one noun. (TA.) The<br>\
former is pronounced by some of the Arabs تِسْعَةَ<br>\
عْشَرَ: and the latter, thus in the dial. of El-Hijáz<br>\
[and of most of the Arabs], is pronounced تِسْعَ<br>\
عَشِرَةَ in the dial. of Nejd. (S in art. عشر.) In<br>\
the Kur lxxiv. 30, some read, تِسْعَةَ عْشَرَ, making<br>\
the ع in عشر quiescent, instead of تِسْعَهَ عَشَرَ, from<br>\
a dislike of this consecution of vowels in what is<br>\
like one word. (Bd, TA. *)<br>\
[<br>\
تِسْعُونَ, Ninety: and ninetieth.]<br>\
[<br>\
تُسَاعَ, as meaning Nine and nine, or nine and<br>\
nine together, or nine at a time and nine at a<br>\
time, seems not to have been in use.] A&#39;Obeyd<br>\
says that more than أُحَادَ and ثُنَآءَ and ثُلَاثَ and<br>\
رُبَاعَ has not been heard, except عُشَارَ occurring in<br>\
a verse of El-Kumeyt. (TA in art. عشر.)<br>\
تَسِيعٌ: see تُسْعٌ.<br>\
تَاسِعٌ [Making to be nine with himself, or itself:<br>\
and hence, ninth]. You say, هُوَ تَاسِعُ تِسْعَةٍ [He<br>\
is the ninth of nine]: and تَاسِعُ ثَمَانِيَةٍ [He is<br>\
making eight to be nine with himself]: but it is<br>\
not allowable to say, تَاسِعٌ تِسْعَةً. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [تَاسِعَ<br>\
عَشَرَ and تَاسِعَةَ عَشْرَةَ, the former masc. and the<br>\
latter fem., meaning Nineteenth, are subject to<br>\
the same rules as ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ and its fem., explained<br>\
in art. ثلث, q. v.]<br>\
تَاسُوعَآءُ, (Msb, TA, &amp;c.,) or التَّاسُوعَآءُ, (S, K,)<br>\
The tenth day of [the month] El-Moharram;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) [the day] before the day of العَاشُورَآءُ,<br>\
(S,) or before the day of عَاشُورَآءُ: (K:) or,<br>\
accord. to some, the same as the day of العاشوراء:<br>\
(TA:) [see عاشوراء, where this is explained:] it<br>\
is a post-classical word: (Sgh, K:) J says, in the<br>\
S, I think it post-classical: (Msb, TA:) but [SM<br>\
says,] this requires consideration; for it was used<br>\
by the Prophet: (TA:) one ought to say, that,<br>\
with عاشوراء, it has this form for the sake of<br>\
resemblance; but as used alone, it must be conceded that it has not been heard [from the Arabs<br>\
of the classical times]. (Msb.)<br>\
