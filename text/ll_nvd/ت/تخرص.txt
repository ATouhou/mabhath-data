تَخْمٌ The limit, or boundary, (S, Msb,) of any<br>\
town (S) or land: (S, Msb:) pl. تُخُومٌ: (S,<br>\
Msb:) a poet (Aboo-Keys Ibn-El-Aslat, TA)<br>\
says,<br>\
يَا بَنِىَّ التُّخُومُ لَا تَظْلِمُوهَا<br>\
(Fr, S,) or, as some relate it, ↓ التَّخُومُ: (TA:)<br>\
accord. to the former reading, Fr says, the meaning is, [O my sons,] the limits, or boundaries,<br>\
[misplace ye not them], for he does not say<br>\
تَظْلِمُوهُ: but ISK says, I heard AA say, it is<br>\
↓ تَخُوم, and the pl. is تُخُمٌ; like صَبُورٌ and صُبُرٌ:<br>\
(S:) both IAar and ISk say that the sing and<br>\
pl. are like رَسُولٌ and رُسُلٌ: (Msb:) but the latter<br>\
mentions also تُخُومٌ, with damm, as a pl. form,<br>\
having no sing.: (TA:) or ↓ تَخُومٌ signifies a<br>\
sign, or mark [of a boundary or of a way]: and<br>\
limits, or boundaries: and is sometimes with<br>\
↓ [to the ت]: (Mgh:) Lth says that تخوم<br>\
[written without any vowel-sign] signifies a division, or place of division, between two districts<br>\
and two towns or villages; and the limit, or<br>\
boundary, of the land of any district and town or<br>\
village is its تخوم: and AHeyth says that this<br>\
word signifies limits, or boundaries: (TA:) or<br>\
تُخُومٌ, with damm, signifies a sign, or mark, and<br>\
a limit, or boundary, that is a division between<br>\
two lands; and is of the fem. gender: and the<br>\
pl. is تُخُومٌ also, and تُخُمٌ: (K:) this app. means<br>\
that these are pls. of تُخُومٌ; but the former is<br>\
a word that is used as a sing. and as a pl.; and<br>\
the latter is pl. of تَخُومٌ, like as صُبُرٌ is of صَبُورٌ,<br>\
and غُفُرٌ of غَفُورٌ: (TA:) or (as ISk says, TA)<br>\
the sing. is ↓ تُخْمٌ and تَخْمٌ (K) and ↓ تَخُومَةٌ:<br>\
(AHn, S, * K:) accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, the Arabic<br>\
linguists say ↓ تَخُومٌ, like صَبُورٌ, making it fem.<br>\
and sing.; but the people of Syria say تُخُومٌ,<br>\
with damm to the ت, making it pl., and the sing.<br>\
is تَخْمٌ: accord. to IB, one says ↓ تَخُومٌ and تُخُومٌ,<br>\
and زَبُورٌ and زُبُورٌ, and عَذُوبٌ and عُذُوبٌ; and<br>\
no fourth instance of the kind is known; [but see<br>\
عَذُوبٌ;] and the Basrees pronounce it with damm<br>\
[to the ت], and the Koofees with fet-h. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., مَلْعُونٌ مَنْ غَيَّرَ تُخُومَ الأَرْضِ,<br>\
meaning, accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, [Cursed is he who<br>\
alters] the limits, or boundaries, of land; and the<br>\
signs, or marks, of the way: or, as some say, the<br>\
limits, or boundaries, of the sacred territory. (TA.)<br>\
And اجعل همّك تخومًا, [or rather اِجْعَلْ لِهَمِّكَ<br>\
↓ تَخُومًا,] means (tropical:)  [Set thou to thy purpose] a limit,<br>\
to which go thou, and pass not beyond it. (TA.)<br>\
And هُوَ طَيِّبُ التُّخُومِ (assumed tropical:)  He is good in respect of<br>\
ancestry, or origin: (JK:) or in respect of<br>\
natural dispositions; or, as some relate the saying,<br>\
↓ التَّخُومِ. (TA.) تُخُومٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A state,<br>\
or condition, that one desires [app. as the limit of<br>\
his wish]. (IAar, Sh, K.)<br>\
