أُتْرُجُّ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) the most chaste of the<br>\
forms here mentioned, (Az, Msb, MF, TA,) a<br>\
pl., (AHát, MF, TA,) [or rather a coll. gen. n.,]<br>\
and ↓ تُرُنْجٌ, (AZ, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) [which is<br>\
Persian,] a dial. var. of weak authority, (Msb,)<br>\
by some disallowed, (MF, TA,) used by the<br>\
vulgar, (TA,) the ن in which is by common<br>\
consent held to be augmentative, (MF, TA,) likewise a pl., (TA,) [or coll. gen. n.,] and ↓ أُتْرُنْجٌ,<br>\
mentioned by Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee, in his<br>\
Faseeh, and also used by the vulgar, (TA,) and<br>\
by some of the people of Hims, (Lth cited in the<br>\
L voce حَظٌّ, q. v.,) [and this is likewise a coll.<br>\
gen. n.,] and أُتْرُجَّةٌ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) which is<br>\
the sing. of the first, (AHát, MF, TA,) or its<br>\
n. un., (L, Msb,) also pronounced أُتْرُجَةٌ, without<br>\
teshdeed, (TA,) and ↓ تُرُنْجَةٌ, (AZ, S, L, &amp;c.,)<br>\
likewise a n. un., (L,) A certain fruit, (Msb,)<br>\
well known, (L, Msb, K,) plentiful in the land of<br>\
the Arabs, but not growing wild, (L, TA,) [of<br>\
the species citrus medica, or citron; of which<br>\
there are two varieties in Egypt; one, of the<br>\
form of the lemon, but larger, there called تُرُنْج<br>\
بَلَدِىّ; the other, ribbed, and called تُرُنْج مُصَبَّع:<br>\
accord. to Golius, citrons of a large size, which<br>\
have a sweeter peel than others, and are of a size<br>\
nearly equal to that of a melon:] the sour sort<br>\
allays the lust of women, clears the complexion,<br>\
and removes the [discoloration of the face termed]<br>\
كَلَف, (K, TA,) that arises from phlegm; (TA;)<br>\
the peel thereof, put among clothes, preserves them<br>\
from the moth-worm: (K, TA:) it is also beneficial as an antidote against the various kinds of<br>\
poison; the smelling it in times of plague, or<br>\
pestilence, is beneficial in the highest degree; and<br>\
jinn, or genii, do not enter the house in which<br>\
it is; wherefore a reciter of the Kur-án is appropriately likened to it: (TA:) the pl. of أُتْرُجَّةٌ is<br>\
أُتْرُجَّاتٌ as well as أُتْرُجٌّ: [or rather the latter is<br>\
a coll. gen. n., as stated above:] but one should<br>\
not say تُرُنْجَاتٌ [app. because it is vulgar; for<br>\
it is agreeable with analogy as pl. of تُرُنْجَةٌ; as<br>\
is also أُتْرُنْجَاتٌ as pl. of ↓ أُتْرُنْجَةٌ]. (AHát, MF,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
أُتْرُنْجٌ and أُتْرُنْجَةٌ: see above.<br>\
