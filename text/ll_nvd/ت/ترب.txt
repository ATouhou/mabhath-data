تَرِبَ, (S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
تَرَبَ, (K,) inf. n. تَرَبٌ,<br>\
(M,) It (a thing) became dusted, or dusty; dust<br>\
lighted upon it: (S, TA:) it (a place, M,) had<br>\
much dust, or earth; abounded with dust, or<br>\
earth. (M, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He (a man, M) had dust,<br>\
or earth, in his hand. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (T, S,<br>\
M, &amp;c.,) inf. n. as above, (M,) He clave to the<br>\
dust, or earth: (M, K:) or he clave to the dust,<br>\
or earth, by reason of poverty; (M;) he became<br>\
so poor that he clave to the dust, or earth:<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, T:) or he became poor, (T, S, Msb,)<br>\
as though he clave to the dust, or earth: (S,<br>\
Msb:) and he suffered loss, and became poor,<br>\
(M, K,) so that he clave to the dust, or earth;<br>\
(M;) inf. n. as above, (M, K,) and مَتْرَبَةٌ, (M,)<br>\
or مَتْرَبٌ, (K,) or both of these: (TA:) his wealth<br>\
became little; (A;) as also ↓ اترب, (M, A, K,)<br>\
and ↓ ترّب: (K:) or ↓ اترب signifies, (T, S, M,)<br>\
or signifies also, (A, K,) and so تَرِبَ, (A,) and<br>\
↓ ترّب, (K,) his wealth became much, or abundant,<br>\
(T, M, A, K,) so that it was like the dust, or<br>\
earth; which is the more known meaning of the<br>\
verb; (M;) or he became rich; (S, Msb;) as<br>\
though he became possessed of wealth equal in<br>\
quantity to the dust, or earth: (S, A:) accord. to<br>\
Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, ↓ تَتْرِيبٌ signifies [the having]<br>\
much wealth; and also [the having] little wealth.<br>\
(T.) You say, ↓ تَرِبَ بَعْدَ مَا أَتْرَبَ , meaning He<br>\
became poor after he had been rich. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
تَرِبَتْ يَدَاكَ, (T, S, A, Msb, in the M and K يَدَاهُ,)<br>\
a form of imprecation, (S, Msb,) meaning [May<br>\
thine arms, or thy hands, cleave to the dust, or<br>\
earth, by reason of poverty; as is implied in the<br>\
T: or] may thy hands have in them dust, or<br>\
earth: (Ham p. 275:) or mayest thou not obtain,<br>\
or attain, good: (S, K: *) or mayest thou be unsuccessful, or fail of attaining thy desire, and<br>\
suffer loss: (A:) occurring in a trad., and as<br>\
some relate, (A&#39;Obeyd, T,) not meant as an imprecation; (A&#39;Obeyd, T, Msb;) being a phrase<br>\
current with the Arabs, who use it without<br>\
desiring its fulfilment; (A&#39;Obeyd, T;) but meant<br>\
to incite, or instigate: (Msb:) some say that it<br>\
means may thy hands become rich; but this is a<br>\
mistake: (A&#39;Obeyd, T:) and it is said to mean<br>\
لِلّٰهِ دَرُّكَ [which see in art. در]: and some say that<br>\
it is literally an imprecation: but the first assertion is the most worthy of respect, (that it is not<br>\
meant as an imprecation,) and is corroborated by<br>\
the saying, in a trad., اِنْعِمْ صَبَاحًا تَرِبَتْ يَدَاكَ<br>\
[Mayest thou have a pleasant morning: may thine<br>\
arms, or thy hands, &amp;c.]. (TA.) تَرِبَتْ جَبِينُهُ<br>\
[May his forehead (for so جبين here means, as<br>\
it does in some other instances,) cleave to the<br>\
dust, or earth,] was said by Mohammad in reproving a man, and is said to mean a prayer that<br>\
the man might be frequent in prostrating himself<br>\
in prayer. (TA from a trad.) And he said to<br>\
one of his companions, تَرِبَتْ نَحْرُكَ [May the<br>\
uppermost part of thy breast cleave to the dust,<br>\
or earth], and the man was [afterwards] slain a<br>\
martyr: therefore this is to be understood in<br>\
its obvious sense. (TA.)<br>\

TA,) with teshdeed, (Msb,) [meaning he sprinkled<br>\
much dust upon it; or sprinkled it much with<br>\
dust;] namely, a writing; (T, Msb, TA;) the<br>\
latter having an intensive signification: (Msb:)<br>\
or ↓ the former of the last two verbs is used in<br>\
speaking of anything that is improved, or put into<br>\
a right or proper state [by means of dust or earth];<br>\
and ↓ the latter of them, in speaking of anything<br>\
that is injured or marred or spoiled [thereby]:<br>\
you say, الإِهَابَ ↓ تَرَبَتِ [She sprinkled, or put,<br>\
dust, or earth, upon the hide], to prepare it<br>\
properly for use; and so of a skin for water or<br>\
milk. (TA.) It is said in a trad., [accord. to one<br>\
reading,] اتْرِبُوا الكِتَابَ [Sprinkle ye the writing<br>\
with dust]. (S. [So in three copies of that work:<br>\
probably أَتْرِبُوا; but perhaps ↓ اِتْرِبُوا: the reading<br>\
commonly known is ↓ تَرِّبُوا.])<br>\

to a male and a female: (TA:) pl. أَتْرَابٌ. (S,<br>\

36], means [Showing love to their husbands;] like,<br>\
or equal, unto them, or resembling them: which<br>\
is a good rendering, as there is no begetting or<br>\
bearing of children, [or rather as the latter word<br>\
does not apply to females born or generated,] in<br>\
that case. (TA.)<br>\
تَرِبٌ, applied to a place, (M, TA,) and to soil,<br>\
(TA,) Abounding with dust; dusty: (T, M,<br>\

graves or of a grave: [so, too, in the present<br>\
day:] pl. تُرَبٌ. (Msb.)<br>\

in the plains, or in soft land, and in rugged<br>\
ground, and in Tihámeh: accord. to AHn, the<br>\
تَرِبَة is a green herb, or leguminous plant, that has<br>\
a purging effect upon camels: (M:) [accord. to<br>\

is applied in the present day.]<br>\

-A2-  and see تَرِبٌ:<br>\
-A3-  and تَرِبَةٌ.<br>\
تُرَبَآءُ: see تُرَابٌ.<br>\
تَرَبُوتٌ A submissive, or tractable, camel; applied<br>\
to the male (T, S, M, K) and to the female: (T,<br>\
S, K:) from تُرَابٌ, (S, M,) because of the abasement thereof; or, as Sb holds it to be, for دَرَبُوتٌ,<br>\
by the change of د into ت: accord. to Lh, a<br>\
[camel such as is termed] بَكْر that is trained, or<br>\
rendered submissive or tractable; and in like<br>\
manner a she-camel, one that will follow a person<br>\
if he takes hold of her lip or her eyelash: and<br>\
As, who derives it from تٌرَابٌ, says that this<br>\
epithet is applied to land, or ground, and any<br>\
other thing, that is ذَلُول [i.e. easy to walk or<br>\
ride upon, &amp;c.]. (M.)<br>\
تُرَابٌ and ↓ تُرْبٌ (Lth, T, S, M, A, Msb, K) and<br>\
↓ تَرْبٌ (CK [but this I do not find elsewhere])<br>\
and ↓ تُرْبَةً (S, A, * K) and ↓ تَرْبَآءُ (Lth, T, S, A, *<br>\

and ↓ تَيْرَابٌ and ↓ تَيْرَبٌ [and ↓ تَيرَبٌ as will be seen<br>\
below] and ↓ تَرِيبٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ تِرْيَبٌ, (M, K)<br>\
accord. to MF ↓ تَرْيَبٌ, which is perhaps a dial.<br>\
var., and accord. to some ↓ تِرْيِبٌ, and ↓ تَرْيَابٌ,<br>\
(TA,) signify the same, (Lth, T, S, M, A, K,)<br>\
and are words of which the meaning is well<br>\
known: (A, K:) [i. e. Dust: and earth: generally the former; i. e. fine, dry, particles of earth;<br>\
as when we say, الرِّيحُ تَسُوقُ التُّرَابَ The wind<br>\
drives along the dust: but we also use the expression تُرَابٌ نَدٍ, meaning moist earth, the explanation, in Lexicons, of the word ثَرًى:] ?ثَرًى is تُرَابٌ;<br>\
and when it ceases to be moist, it is still تراب, but<br>\
is not then called ثرى: (Msb voce ثرى:) accord.<br>\
to Fr, تُرَابٌ is a gen. n., from which is formed<br>\
neither dual nor pl.: and its rel. n. is ↓ تُرَابِىٌّ:<br>\
(TA:) [but when it means a kind of dust or<br>\
earth, as ↓ تُرْبَةٌ also does sometimes, it has a pl.:<br>\
in this case,] accord. to Lh, (M,) its pl. is أَتْرِبَةٌ<br>\
[a pl. of pauc.] and تِرْبَانٌ [a pl. of mult.]; (S, M,<br>\
K) and some add تُرْبَانٌ: (TA:) [and when ↓ تُرْبَةٌ<br>\
has this, or a similar, meaning, it has for its pl.<br>\
تُرَبٌ; as in the phrase أَطْيَبُ التُّرَبِ the best of the<br>\
kinds of earth, occurring in this art. in the A:]<br>\
but no pl. of any of the other syn. words mentioned above has been heard: (M, K:) AAF<br>\
says that تراب is the pl. of ترب; [app. meaning<br>\
that تُرَابٌ is a quasi-pl. n. (which is often called<br>\
in lexicons a pl.) of تُرْبٌ;] but MF observes that<br>\
this requires consideration: (TA:) Lth says that<br>\
↓ تُرْبٌ and تُرَابٌ are syn.; but when the fem. forms<br>\
of these words are used, they say, ↓ أَرْضٌ طَيّبَةُ التُّرْبَة<br>\
meaning Land that is good in respect of the<br>\
natural constitution of its dust or earth; and<br>\
↓ تُرَابَةٌ when meaning A layer, or lamina, of dust<br>\
or earth, such as is not perceived by the sight, but<br>\
only by the imagination: (T:) or this last word<br>\
and ↓ تُرْبَةٌ signify a portion of dust or earth:<br>\
and الأَرْضِ ↓ تُرْبَةُ signifies the exterior, or external<br>\
part, of the earth: (M:) and ↓ التَّرْبَآءُ, the earth<br>\
(S, K) itself. (S.) The Arabs said, التُّرَابُ لَكَ<br>\
[Dust, or earth, be thy lot]; using the nom. case,<br>\
although meaning an imprecation, because the<br>\
word is a simple subst., not an inf. n.: but Lh<br>\
mentions the phrase التُّرَابَ لِلْأَبْعَدِ [Dust, or earth,<br>\
be the lot of the remote from good]; saying that<br>\
the accus. case is used, as though the phrase were<br>\
an imprecation [of the ordinary kind, in which an<br>\
inf. n. is used in the accus. case as the absolute<br>\
complement of its own verb understood]. (M.)<br>\
And لَهُ التُّرَابُ is a phrase used as meaning (assumed tropical:)  [He<br>\
has, or shall have, or may he have,] disappointment, (Msb in art. عهر,) or, nothing. (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
Mgh in art. فرش.) لَهُ وَجَنْدَلًا ↓ تُرْبًا is also a form<br>\
of imprecation, in which substs. in the proper<br>\
sense of the term are used in the manner of inf. ns.,<br>\
put in the accus. case by reason of a verb unexpressed; as though it were for تَرِبَتْ يَدَاهُ وَجُنْدِلَتْ<br>\
[May his arms, or his hands, cleave to the dust,<br>\
or earth, and the stones, by reason of poverty]:<br>\
and some of the Arabs put the nouns in the nom.<br>\
case, still using the phrase in the same sense, as<br>\
though they were in the accus. (M.) One says<br>\
also, ↓ بِفِيهِ التَّوْرَبُ and ↓ التَّيْرَبُ and ↓ التِّيِرَبُ and<br>\
↓ التَّرْبَآءُ and ↓ التَّوْرَابُ [In his mouth is dust, or<br>\
earth: or may dust, or earth, be in his mouth;<br>\
i. e. may he die, or be in his grave]. (T.) It is<br>\
said in a trad. that God created the ↓ تُرْبَة [meaning the dust, or soil, or, accord. to the TA the<br>\
earth (أَرْض),] on the seventh day of the week;<br>\
and created upon it the mountains on the first<br>\
day; and the trees, on the second day. (T.) And<br>\
one says, ↓ لَأَضْرِبَنَّهُ حَتَّى يَعَضَّ بِالتَّرْبَآءِ, (Lth, T, A,)<br>\
meaning [I will assuredly beat him so that he<br>\
shall bite] the dust, or earth. (Lth, T.) And<br>\
↓ بَيْنَهُمَا مَا بَيْنَ الجَرْبَآءِ وَالتَّرْبَآءِ, meaning [Between<br>\
them two is the space that is between] the heaven<br>\
and the earth. (A.)<br>\

تَرَائِبُ, (S, M, TA,) which signifies The part of<br>\
the breast which is the place of the collar, or necklace: (T, M, K:) so by the common consent of<br>\
the lexicologists: (T:) or the bones of the breast:<br>\
(M, A, K:) or the bones of the breast that are<br>\
between the collar-bone and the pap: (S:) or the<br>\
part of the breast, or chest, that is next to the<br>\
two collar-bones: or the part that is between the<br>\
two breasts and the collar-bones: or four ribs of<br>\
the right side of the chest and four of the left<br>\
thereof: (M, K:) or the two arms and two legs<br>\
and two eyes: (T, M, K:) it is also said that the<br>\
تَرِيبَتَانِ are the two ribs that are next to the two<br>\
collar-bones: IAth says that the تَرِيبَة is the uppermost part of the human breast, beneath the chin;<br>\
and its pl. is as above: accord. to IF, in the Mj,<br>\
the ↓ تريب is the breast, or chest: MF says that<br>\
ترائب relates to males and females in common;<br>\
but most of the authors on strange words affirm<br>\
decidedly that it is peculiar to women: (TA:)<br>\
the تَرِيبَة of the camel is the part in which it is<br>\
stabbed, or stuck; syn. مَنْحَر. (M.)<br>\

earth: (Lh and M: [in the TA, اترب is mentioned as having this meaning; perhaps by a<br>\
mistranscription: if not, it must be ↓ أَتْرَبُ:])<br>\
and having little wealth: thus it bears two contr.<br>\
significations: (K:) but the former is the more<br>\
known. (TA.)<br>\
