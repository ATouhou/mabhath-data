تَمِ3َ, (T, M,<br>\

and تُمَامٌ, (K,) and تَمَامَةٌ (M, K) and تِمَامَةٌ, (K,)<br>\
and تمُّ and تَمٌّ and تُمٌّ, (M, K,) of which last<br>\
three forms the first is said to be the most chaste,<br>\
(TA,) [The thing was, or became, complete, entire,<br>\
whole, or full; i. e., without, or free from, deficiency: and sometimes, the thing was, or became,<br>\
consummate, or perfect; which latter signification<br>\
is more properly expressed by كَمَلَ:] accord. to<br>\
the author of the K, as is shown in art. كمل, and<br>\
accord. to some others, تَمَامٌ and كَمَالٌ are syn.;<br>\
but several authors make a distinction between<br>\
them: the former is said to signify a thing&#39;s being,<br>\
or becoming, without, or free from, deficiency;<br>\
and the latter, to signify تمام and something<br>\
more, as, for instance, goodliness, and excellence,<br>\
essential or accidental; though each is sometimes<br>\
used in the sense of the other: or, as some say,<br>\
the former necessarily implies previous deficiency;<br>\
but the latter does not: (MF, TA:) or, accord.<br>\
to El-Harállee, the latter signifies the attaining to<br>\
the utmost point, or degree, in every respect: or,<br>\
as Ibn-El-Kemál says, when one says of a thing<br>\
كَمَلَ, he means that what was desired of it<br>\
became realized. (TA.) [See also تَمَامٌ, below.]<br>\
You say, تَمَّ خَلْقُهُ [His make, or formation, was,<br>\
or became, complete, or perfect; he (a child or<br>\
the like, and a man,) was, or became, fully formed<br>\
or developed, or complete in his members; and he<br>\
(a man) was, or became, full-grown]: (TA:)<br>\
[whence, probably,] تَمَّ الشَّىْءُ [as meaning] The<br>\
thing became strong and hard. (Msb.) And<br>\
تَمَّ القَمَرُ, (T, S, Msb,) or ↓ اتمّ, (M, K,) The<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  تَمَّ إِلَى كَذَا He reached, attained, arrived at,<br>\

and إِلَيْهِ ↓ اتمّ, He repaired, or betook himself, to,<br>\
or towards, such a place; he went to it. (Har<br>\
p. 508.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb says,<br>\
فَبَاتَ بِجَمْعٍ ثُمَّ تَمَّ إِلَى مِنًى<br>\
[which may be rendered And he passed the night<br>\
in Jema (a name of El-Muzdelifeh): then he<br>\
repaired, or went, to Minè; there completing the<br>\
ceremonies of the pilgrimage; wherefore ISd<br>\
says,] I think that, by تمّ, [or rather تمّ الى منى,]<br>\
he means he completed his pilgrimage. (M.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
تَمَّ بِهِ, and تَمَّ عَلَيْهِ: see their syn. اتمّهُ (4). ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
[Hence,] تَمَّ عَلَيْهِ He performed it, or executed<br>\
it; he accomplished it; namely, an affair; a fast;<br>\
a purpose, or an intention. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And He<br>\
persevered in it; (Mgh, TA;) as also تَمَمَ عَلَيْهِ,<br>\
without teshdeed, as in the phrase إِنْ تَمَمَتْ عَلَى<br>\
مَا أُرِيدُ [If she persevere in what I desire], occurring in a trad.; but IAth says that the verb here<br>\
means ↓ تَمَّمَتْ. (TA.) You say, تَمَّ عَلَى الإبَآءِ He<br>\
persevered in refusal, or dislike, or disapproval.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\

التَّتْمِيمُ in the game called الميسر signifies A<br>\

the shares, or make up their full number, when<br>\

i. e. [The fracture, or the broken bone, or simply<br>\
the bone,] cracked, without separating (وَلَمْ يَبِنْ):<br>\
or cracked, and then separated. (M, K.) You<br>\
say, تَمَّمَ الكَسْرَ فَتَمَّمَ and ↓ تَتَمَّمَ [He, or it, completed the fracture, or cracked the broken bone,<br>\
or the bone, and it cracked, &amp;c.]. (M.) And<br>\
↓ ظَلَعَ فُلَانٌ ثُمَّ تَتَمَّمَ, i. e. [Such a one limped, or<br>\
halted, or was slightly lame: then] his lameness<br>\
became complete by fracture: from تُمَّ signifying<br>\
“ it was broken: ” (T:) [or تَتَمَّمَ signifies his<br>\
lameness became complete by an increased fracture, after he had had a fracture with which he<br>\
was able to walk: this is what is meant by the<br>\
following loose explanation:] التَّتَمُّمُ مَنْ كَانَ بِهِ<br>\
كَسْرٌ يَمْشِى بِهِ ثُمَّ أَبَتَّ فَتَتَمَّمَ. (K. [In the CK,<br>\

T, M, K;) as also ↓ تتمّم; (K, TA; [in the CK,<br>\
تمّم again;]) or accord. to analogy it would be<br>\
تتمّم, like تمضّر and تنزّر. (T.) And He asserted<br>\

last) [He made the thing, or the affair, complete,<br>\
entire, whole, or full; i. e., without, or free from,<br>\
deficiency; he completed it: and sometimes, he<br>\
consummated, or perfected, it]. وَأَتِمُّو الحَجَّ وَالعُمْرَةَ,<br>\
in the Kur [ii. 192], means And perform ye, or<br>\
accomplish ye, completely, the rites and ceremonies [of the pilgrimage and the minor pilgrimage]; (M, * Bd;) accord. to some: or, as<br>\
some say, إِتْمَامُ الحَجِّ means that the money, or<br>\
the like, that one expends in performing the pilgrimage should be lawfully obtained, and that<br>\

which are put thongs and amulets (عُوَذ): (M:)<br>\
or a necklace (قِلَادَة) of thongs: and is sometimes<br>\
applied to the amulet (عُوذَة) that is hung upon<br>\
the necks of children: (T:) but he who makes<br>\
تمائم to signify thongs is in error: El-Farezdak<br>\
uses the phrase سُيُورُ التَّمَائِمِ because they are<br>\
beads which are perforated, and into which are<br>\
inserted thongs or strings whereby they are suspended: (T, Mgh:) Az says, I have not found<br>\
among the Arabs of the desert any difference of<br>\
opinion respecting the تميمة, as to its being the<br>\
bead itself: (TA:) but accord. to En-Nakha&#39;ee,<br>\
the Prophet disapproved of everything hung upon<br>\
a child or grown person, and said that all such<br>\
things were تمائم: (Mgh:) the تميمة is [said to<br>\
be] thus called because by it the condition of the<br>\
child is rendered complete. (Har p. 22.)<br>\

so as not to make another understand: (Mgh,<br>\

applied to a man; (MF, TA;) [and, thus applied,<br>\
signifying also full-grown, as does, sometimes,<br>\

↓ تَمِيمٌ signifies the same, (M, K,) applied to a<br>\
man and to a horse, (M,) and ↓ تَمَمٌ also; and in<br>\
like manner is used the phrase ↓ خَلْقٌ تَمَمٌ [a<br>\
complete, or perfect, make or formation]. (TA.)<br>\
جَذَعٌ تَامٌّ [applied to a goat] signifies That has<br>\
completed the time in which he is termed جَذَع,<br>\
and attained to that in which he is termed تَيْس.<br>\
(TA.) And ↓ تَمَمٌ is applied to a bull, or an ox,<br>\
That is in the stage of growth next before that in<br>\
which all his teeth are grown; in which latter<br>\
stage he is termed عَمَمٌ. (L voce عَضْبٌ, on the<br>\
authority of Et-Táïfee.) You say also كَلِمَةٌ تَامَّةٌ,<br>\
and دَعْوَهٌ تَامَّةٌ; [meaning A perfect, or faultless,<br>\
sentence, and oath;] using the epithet تامّة in<br>\
these instances because of the mention of God<br>\
therein; for which reason there may not be in<br>\
aught of either of them any deficiency or defect.<br>\
(TA.) And ↓ جَعَلَهُ تِمًّا i. e. ↓ تَمَامًا [He made it<br>\
complete, or perfect]. (M.) And ↓ جَعَلْتُهُ لَكَ تِمًّا<br>\
I made it, or have made it, to be thine, or I<br>\
assigned it, or have assigned it, to thee, completely,<br>\
or wholly. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, فِعْلٌ تَامٌّ meaning A<br>\
complete, i. e. an attributive, verb: opposed to<br>\
فِعْلٌ نَاقِصٌ.]<br>\
تَتِمَّةٌ: see تَمَامٌ, in three places, at the close of<br>\
the paragraph.<br>\
مُتَمٌّ The place of cutting, or termination,<br>\
(مُنْقَطَع, in the CK مُنْقَطِع,) of the vein (عِرْق<br>\
[app. meaning chord]) of the navel. (K.)<br>\
مُتِمٌّ, applied to one that is pregnant, (S,) or to<br>\
a woman, (M, TA,) and a she-camel, (M,) That<br>\
has completed the days of her gestation: (S:) or<br>\
that is near to bringing forth: (M:) or that is<br>\
at the point of bringing forth. (TA.)<br>\
مُتَمِّمٌ One whose arrow wins time after time<br>\
[in the game called المَيْسِر], and who feeds the<br>\
poor with the flesh [of the camel which constitutes<br>\
the shares] thereof: (M, K:) or who, when players<br>\
in the game called الميسر have diminished the<br>\
slaughtered camel [by taking their shares], takes<br>\
what has remained, so as to complete the shares,<br>\
or make up their full number. (K. [See 2. In<br>\
the CK, نَقَصَ اِيْسارَ جَزُوْرِ المَيْسِرِ is erroneously<br>\
put for نَقَصَ أَيْسَارٌ جَزُورَ المَيْسِرِ.])<br>\
الجَهَالَةُ المُسْتَتَمَّةُ Consummate ignorance: improperly written المُسْتَتِمَّةُ, though this latter is<br>\
explainable [as meaning that completes the extent<br>\
to which it can go, or the like]. (Mgh.)<br>\
مُسْتَتِمٌّ One who seeks, demands, or requests,<br>\
wool, or camels&#39; hair, to complete therewith the<br>\
weaving of his كِسَآء: so in a poem of Aboo-Duwád, (S,) where he says,<br>\
فَهْىَ كَالبَيْضِ فِى الأَدَاحِىِّ لَا يُوْ<br>\
هَبُ مِنْهَا لِمُسْتَتِمٍّ عِصَامُ<br>\
i. e., And they (referring to certain camels) are,<br>\
in respect of the care that is taken of them, and<br>\
in smoothness, like the eggs [in the places where<br>\
the ostrich has deposited them in the sand]; there<br>\
may not be found upon them to be given from<br>\
them, to one who demands a تِمَّة, [even so much<br>\
as] a tie for a water-skin; for they have become<br>\
fat, and cast their hair. (TA.)<br>\
