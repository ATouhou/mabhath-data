(Mgh;) [The practice of traffic, merchandise, or<br>\

the trade of the تَاجِر, i. e., of him who sells and<br>\
buys for gain; (Ksh in ii. 15;) the seeking of<br>\
gain by selling and buying. (Bd ibid.) [See also<br>\

-b2-  Also Merchandise, meaning what is sold<br>\
and bought, of goods, or commodities, or householdfurniture, and the like; a quasi-inf. n. used in<br>\
the sense of a pass. part. n. (Mgh.) [Hence the<br>\
saying,] عَلَيْكُمْ بِتِجَارَةِ الآخِرَةِ (tropical:)  [Keep ye to the<br>\

merchandise, or commerce; a trafficker; a trader,<br>\
or tradesman; a dealer; one who sells and buys;<br>\
(K;) one who sells and buys for gain: (Ksh in<br>\
ii. 15:) and a vintner, or seller of wine, (S, K,)<br>\
was also called thus by the Arabs: (S:) accord.<br>\
to IAth, this latter is said to be the primary signification: and hence the saying in a trad., إِنَّ<br>\
التَّاجِرَ فَاجِرٌ [Verily the vintner is a transgressor]:<br>\
(TA:) pl. تُجَّارٌ and تِجَارٌ and ↓ تَجْرٌ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) [or rather this last is a quasi-pl. n.,] like as<br>\
صَحْبٌ is of صَاحِبٌ, (S, Msb,) and تُجُرٌ, (K,) or<br>\
this may be a pl. of تِجَارٌ. (ISd, TA.) ↓ التَّجِرُ.<br>\
occurring in a verse of El-Akhtal, [for التَّاجِرُ,] is<br>\
thought by ISd to be like طَهِرٌ [for طَاهِرٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  A man skilful in an affair. (K,<br>\
TA.) The Arabs say, إِنَّهُ لَتَاجِرٌ بِذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ<br>\
(tropical:)  Verily he is skilful in that affair. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A she-camel that is saleable, or easy of<br>\
sale, or in much demand, in traffic, and in the<br>\
market; (A &#39;Obeyd, S, K;) as also تَاجِرَةٌ: (K:)<br>\
or the latter, a she-camel that is goodly, and saleable, or in much demand: (A:) or that is easy<br>\
of sale when offered, by reason of her excellence:<br>\
(T:) or simply, that is easy of sale, or in much<br>\
demand: (S:) as though, by reason of her beauty,<br>\
or goodliness, and fatness, she sold herself: (Ksh<br>\
in ii. 15:) contr. of كَاسِدَةٌ: (S, * TA:) the pl.<br>\
of تاجرة is تَوَاجِرُ. (T, A.) You say also, عَلَيْكَ<br>\
بِالسِّلَعِ التَّوَاجِرِ (tropical:)  [Keep thou to the commodities]<br>\
that are saleable, or in much demand. (A.) And<br>\
هُوَ عَلَى أَكْرَمِ تَاجِرَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  He is upon a most noble<br>\
horse. (K.)<br>\
أَرْضٌ مُتْجَرَةٌ [in the TA, مَتْجِرَةٌ, but this is<br>\
wrong,] A land in which traffic, merchandise,<br>\
or commerce, is practised; (S, L, K;) and to<br>\
which people go for the purpose of practising the<br>\
same: (K:) pl. مَتَاجِرُ. (TA.)<br>\
