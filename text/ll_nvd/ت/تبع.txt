تَبِعَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
تَبَعَ, inf. n.<br>\
تَبَعٌ (S, Msb, K) and تَبَاعَةٌ, (S, K,) He followed;<br>\
or went, or walked, behind, or after; (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K;) him, (Mgh, Msb, K,) or it; namely,<br>\
a people, or company of men: (S:) or [in the<br>\
CK “ and ”] he went with him, or it, when the<br>\
latter had passed by him: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) and<br>\
↓ اِتَّبَعَهُ signifies the same; (Lth, S, K *) and so<br>\
does ↓ أَتْبَعَهُ: (Lth, Mgh, K:) or ↓ أَتْبَعْتُهُمْ signifies<br>\
I overtook them, they having gone before me;<br>\
(Fr, * A&#39;Obeyd, S, Msb, * K;) as also تَبِعْتُهُمْ: (Fr,<br>\
K:) Akh says that تَبِعْتُهُ and ↓ أَتْبَعْتُهُ signify the<br>\
same: and hence the saying in the Kur [xxxvii. 10],<br>\
شِهَابٌ ثَاقِبٌ ↓ فَأَتْبَعَهُ [and a shooting star piercing<br>\
the darkness by its light overtaketh him]: (S:)<br>\
and the saying in the same [vii. 174], ↓ فَأَتْبَعَهُ<br>\
الشَّيْطَانُ and the devil overtook him: (TA:) and<br>\
the saying in the same [xx. 81], فِرْعَوْنُ ↓ فَأَتْبَعَهُمْ<br>\
بِجُنُودِهِ and Pharaoh overtook them with his<br>\
troops: or almost did so: (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, K:) or<br>\
this signifies made his troops to follow them;<br>\
(TA;) the ب, accord. to some, being redundant:<br>\
(Bd:) or ↓ أَتْبَعَهُ signifies he followed his footsteps;<br>\
and sought him, following him: (TA:) but ↓ اِتَّبَعَهُمْ<br>\
signifies he went [after them, or followed them,]<br>\
when they had passed by him; as also تَبِعَهُمْ,<br>\
inf. n. تَبَعٌ: you say, ↓ حَتَّى أَتْبَعْتُهُمْ ↓ مَا زِلْتُ أَتَّبِعُهُمْ,<br>\
i. e. [I ceased not to follow them] until I overtook<br>\
them: (A&#39;Obeyd:) Fr says that ↓ أَتْبَعَ is better<br>\
than ↓ اِتَّبَعَ; for the latter signifies he went behind,<br>\
or after, him, when the latter person was going<br>\
along; but when you say, ↓ أَتْبَعْتُهُ, it is as though<br>\
[you meant that] you followed his footsteps:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا ↓ اِتَّبَعَ [as in the L and<br>\
TA, but perhaps a mistake for ↓ أَتْبَعَ,] signifies<br>\
also he followed him, desiring to do evil to him;<br>\
like as Pharaoh followed Moses: (L, TA:) some<br>\
say, تَبِعْتُ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. تُبُوعٌ, meaning I went<br>\
after the thing: and تَبِعَ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. تَبَعٌ and<br>\
تَبَاعٌ, (assumed tropical:)  [he followed the thing] in respect of actions:<br>\
(L, TA:) you say, تَبِعَ الإِمَامَ (assumed tropical:)  he followed the<br>\
Imám [by doing as he did]: (Msb:) [but in this<br>\
last sense, more commonly,] one says, ↓ اِتَّبَعَهُ,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  he did like as he [another] did: (TA:)<br>\
and القُرْآنَ ↓ اِتَّبَعَ (assumed tropical:)  he followed the Kurán as his<br>\
guide; did according to what is in it: (TA:)<br>\
and you say also, عَلَى الأَمْرِ ↓ تَابَعَهُ; (Msb;) or<br>\
على كَذَا, inf. n. مُتَابَعَةٌ and تِبَاعٌ; (S;) (assumed tropical:)  [he<br>\
followed him, or imitated him, in the affair;]<br>\
(Msb;) he followed him, or imitated him, in<br>\
doing such a thing: (PS:) [but this last phrase<br>\
has another meaning: see 3.] In the saying,<br>\
لَا يُتْبَعُ بِنَارٍ إِلَى القَبْرِ, [in which the verb may be<br>\
pass. of تَبِعَ or of ↓ أَتْبَعَ,] or, accord. to one relation, ↓ لا يُتَّبَعُ, each in the pass. form, [Fire shall<br>\
not be made to follow to the grave, though it may<br>\
be rendered one shall not follow with fire to the<br>\
grave, it is said that] the ب is to render the verb<br>\
transitive. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تَبِعْتُ الرَّجُلَ بِحَقِّى; and<br>\
بِهِ ↓ تَابَعْتُهُ, inf. n. مُتَابَعَةٌ [and probably تبَاعٌ also];<br>\
and به ↓ اِتَّبَعْتُهُ; I prosecuted, or sued, the man<br>\
for my right, or due. (TA.) The saying in the<br>\
Kur [ii. 173], بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ↓ فَاتِّبَاعٌ means [Then]<br>\
prosecution for the bloodwit [shall be made with<br>\
lenity]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  تَبِعَ, of which the aor., يَتْبَع,<br>\
occurs in a trad., [see 4,] (Mgh, TA,) pronounced<br>\
by the relaters of trads. with teshdeed, [↓ يَتَّبِع,]<br>\
(TA,) also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He accepted a reference<br>\
from his debtor to another for the payment of<br>\
what was owed to him. (Mgh, TA. *)<br>\
2<br>\
تَبَّعَ اللّٰهُ لِفُلَانٍ, inf. n. تَتْبِيعٌ, May God make<br>\
a thing to be followed by another thing to such a<br>\
one, is said in relation to good and to evil; like<br>\
سَبَّعَ لَهُ. (TA in art. سبع.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 5.<br>\
3<br>\
تِبَاعٌ [and مُتَابَعَةٌ, the inf. ns. of تَابَعَ,] i. q.<br>\
وِلَآءٌ [The making a consecution, or succession, of<br>\
one to the other, بَيْنَ أَمْرَيْنِ between two things,<br>\
or affairs: and the making consecutive, successive,<br>\
or uninterrupted, in its progressions, or gradations, or the like: see 6]. (S, K.) It is said<br>\
in a trad., تَابِعُوا بَيْنَ الحَجِّ والعُمْرَةِ [Make ye a<br>\
consecution between the حجّ and the عمرة; meaning make ye the performance of the حجّ and that<br>\
of the عمرة to be consecutive]; (TA;) i. e. when<br>\
ye perform the حجّ, then perform ye the عمرة;<br>\
and when ye perform the عمرة, then perform ye<br>\
the حجّ: or when ye perform either of these, then<br>\
perform ye after it the other, without any length<br>\
of time [intervening]: but the former [meaning]<br>\
is the more obvious. (Marginal note in a copy of<br>\
the Jámi&#39;-es-Sagheer of Es-Suyootee.) And you<br>\
say, تَابِعْ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَهُمْ عَلَى الخَيْرَاتِ (assumed tropical:)  Make thou us<br>\
to be followers, or imitators, of them in excellencies.<br>\
(TA.) And تابع الأَغَانِىَّ [He sang songs consecutively, successively, or uninterruptedly]. (S and<br>\
K in art. جر.) And تابع إِسْقَاطَهُ [He made it to<br>\
fall, fall down, drop, drop down, or tumble down,<br>\
in consecutive portions or quantities]. (M and K<br>\
in art. سقط: in the CK اَسْقاطَهُ.) And تابع الفَرَسُ<br>\
الجَرْىَ (assumed tropical:)  [The horse prosecuted, or continued, the<br>\
course, or running, uninterruptedly]. (K voce<br>\
هَلَبَ; &amp;c.) And هُوَ يَتَابِعُ الحَدِيثَ (tropical:)  He carries<br>\
on the narrative, or discourse, by consecutive progressions, or uninterruptedly: or, as Z says, pursues it, or carries it on, well. (TA.) [See also a<br>\
similar phrase in what here follows.] ―<br>\
-b2-  تابع القَوْسَ<br>\
He pared, or trimmed, the bow well, giving to<br>\
each part thereof what was its due. (K, TA.)<br>\
Skr says that the phrase تُوبِعَ بَرْيُهَا, used by Aboo-Kebeer El-Hudhalee in describing a bow, means<br>\
The paring, or trimming, of which has been executed with uniformity, part after part. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Hence, (TA,) the saying of Abu-l-Wákid ElLeythee, (S, TA,) in a trad., (S,) تَابَعْنَا الأَعْمَالَ<br>\
فَلَمْ نَجِدْ شَيْئًا أَبْلَغَ فِى طَلَبِ الآخِرَةِ مِنَ الزُّهْدِ فِى<br>\
الدُّنْيَا (S, TA) (assumed tropical:)  We have practised works with<br>\
diligence, and acquired a sound knowledge of<br>\
them, [and we have not found anything more<br>\
efficacious in the pursuit of the blessings of the<br>\
world to come than abstinence in respect of the<br>\
enjoyments of the present world.] (S, * TA.) You<br>\
say also, تابع عَمَلَهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He made his work<br>\
sound, or free from defect: (Kr, S:) and in like<br>\
manner, كَلَامَهُ his language, or speech. (Kr.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence also,] تابع المَرْعَى الإِبِلَ (tropical:)  The pasture<br>\
fattened the camels well and thoroughly. (K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  تابعهُ عَلَى الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  He aided, assisted, or<br>\
helped, him to do the thing, or affair. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
See also 1, where another meaning of the same<br>\
phrase is mentioned, in the latter half of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b7-  تَابَعْتُهُ بِحَقِّى: see 1, near the end of the<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
اتبعهُ: see 1, from the beginning nearly to<br>\
the end.<br>\
-A2-  Also He made him to follow; or to<br>\
overtake: (S, K:) he made him to be a follower:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) or he urged him, or induced him,<br>\
to be a follower. (Mgh.) You say, [making the<br>\
verb doubly trans.,] أَتْبَعْتُهُمْ غَيْرِى [I made them to<br>\
follow, or overtake, another, not myself]. (K.) And<br>\
أَتْبَعْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ فَتَبِعَهُ [I made him to follow, or overtake, the thing, and he followed it, or overtook<br>\
it]. (S.) And أَتْبَعْتُ زَيْدًا عَمْرًا I made Zeyd to<br>\
be a follower of &#39;Amr: (Mgh, Msb:) or I urged,<br>\
or induced, Zeyd to be a follower of &#39;Amr.<br>\
(Mgh.) And أَتْبَعَهُ نَفْسَهُ مُتَحَسِّرًا عَلَى مَا فَاتَ (assumed tropical:)  [He<br>\
made his mind, or desire, to follow after it, regretting what had passed away]. (TA in art.<br>\
عجز.) [See also 10.] It is said in a prov., (TA,)<br>\
أَتْبِعِ الفَرَسَ لِجَامَهَا [Make thou its bit and bridle<br>\
to follow the horse]: or النَّاقَةَ زِمَامَهَا [her nose-rein,<br>\
the she-camel]: or الدَّلْوَ رِشَآءَهَا [its rope, the<br>\
bucket]: used in bidding to complete a favour, or<br>\
benefaction: (K, TA:) A&#39;Obeyd says, I think the<br>\
meaning of the first prov. to be, Thou hast liberally given the horse, and the bit and bridle are a<br>\
smaller matter; therefore satisfy thou completely<br>\
the want, seeing that the horse is not without<br>\
need of the bit and bridle. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the<br>\
trad., مَنْ أُتْبِعَ عَلَى مَلِىْءٍ فَلْيَتْبَعْ (tropical:)  Whoso is<br>\
referred, for the payment of what is owed to him,<br>\
to a solvent man, let him accept the reference:<br>\
(Mgh, TA: *) [see also 1, last meaning:] the verb<br>\
being made trans. by means of على because it<br>\
conveys the meaning of إِحَالَةٌ. (Mgh.) You say<br>\
[also], أُتْبِعَ فُلَانٌ بِفُلَانٍ (tropical:)  Such a one was referred,<br>\
for the payment of what was owed to him, to<br>\
such a one. (S, TA.) And أَتْبَعَهُ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  He referred him, for the payment of what was owed<br>\
to him, to him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [See also إِتْبَاعٌ, below.]<br>\
5<br>\
تتبّعهُ, inf. n. تَتَبُّعٌ, (Lth, S, Msb, * K,) for<br>\
which ↓ اِتِّبَاعٌ is used by El-Kutámee, tropically,<br>\
(S,) or, accord. to Sb, because the same in meaning; (TA;) and ↓ تبعّه, inf. n. تَتْبِيعٌ; (S, K; *)<br>\
He pursued it; investigated it; examined it;<br>\
hunted after it; prosecuted a search after it;<br>\
made successive, or repeated, endeavours to attain<br>\
it, to reach it, or to obtain it; or sought it, sought<br>\
for it, or sought after it, successively, time after<br>\
time, or repeatedly, or in a leisurely manner, by<br>\
degrees, gradually, step by step, bit by bit, or one<br>\
thing after another, (Lth, S, * Msb, K, * TA,)<br>\
following after it. (S.) Hence the saying of<br>\
Zeyd Ibn-Thábit, respecting the collecting of the<br>\
Kur-án, فَعَلِقْتُ أَتَتَبَّعُهُ مِنَ اللِّخَافِ وَالعُسُبِ [And<br>\
I set myself to seeking to collect it successively,<br>\
&amp;c., from the thin white stones and the leafless<br>\

And تتبّع البِلَادَ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ أَرْضٍ إِلَى أَرْضٍ [He<br>\
investigated the countries, going forth from land<br>\
to land]. (S and K in art. قرى.) And فُلَانٌ يَتَتَبَّعُ<br>\

seeks successively, &amp;c., to discover the vices, faults,<br>\
or evil qualities or actions, of such a one]. (TA.)<br>\
And يَتَتَبَّعُ مَدَاقَّ الأُمُورِ وَنَحْوَ ذٰلِكَ [He pursues<br>\
small, or little, affairs; and the like thereof: or<br>\
he seeks successively, &amp;c., to obtain a knowledge<br>\
of the subtilties, niceties, abstrusities, or obscuri-<br>\
ties, of things, or affairs; and the like thereof].<br>\
(TA.) And تتبّع الحَبْلَ [He took successive holds<br>\
of the rope]: said of a man descending from a<br>\
part of a mountain such as is termed شِيق, by<br>\
means of a rope tied to that part, to a place in<br>\
which honey was deposited. (TA in art. شيق.)<br>\
6<br>\
تتابع It was, or became, consecutive, successive, or uninterrupted, in its progressions, or<br>\
gradations, or the like; syn. تَوَالَى. (K.) You<br>\
say, تتابع سُقُوطُهُ [Its falling, falling down, dropping, dropping down, or tumbling down, was, or<br>\
became, consecutive, &amp;c.; i. e. it fell, fell down, &amp;c.,<br>\
in consecutive portions or quantities]. (M and K in<br>\
art. سقط.) And تتابع القَوْمُ The people, or company of men, followed one another. (Msb.) And<br>\

another, each following near upon another. (Lth.)<br>\

came consecutively upon Kureysh]. (TA.) ―<br>\

one of his limbs [above its fellow]. (TA.) ―<br>\

whithersoever she goes: (TA:) and with ة, of a<br>\

(K.) [See تَابِعٌ.] You say also, هُوَ تِبْعُ ضِلَّةٍ,<br>\
meaning He is a follower of women: and تِبْعُ ضِلَّةٌ<br>\
one in whom is no good, and with whom is no<br>\

(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  هٰذَا تِبْعُ هٰذَا This is what follows this.<br>\
(M in art. تلو.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also تَبِيعٌ, in two places.<br>\
تَبَعٌ: see تَابِعٌ, in six places.<br>\
رَجُلٌ تُبَعٌ لِلْكَلَامِ A man who makes his speech<br>\
consecutive, one part to another. (Yoo, K. *)<br>\
بَقَرَةٌ تَبْعَى A cow desiring [and therefore following] the bull. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
تَبِعَةٌ and ↓ تِبَاعَةٌ signify the same; (T, S, O, L,<br>\
K;) [The consequence of an action: and] a claim<br>\
which one seeks to obtain for an injury, or injurious treatment, and the like: (T, O, L, K; and<br>\
so the Msb in explanation of the former word:)<br>\
the former is also explained as signifying a right,<br>\
or due, annexed to property, claimed from the<br>\
possessor of the property: (L:) pl. [of the former]<br>\
تَبِعَاتٌ and [of the latter] تِبَاعَاتٌ. (TA.) A poet<br>\
says,<br>\
زَمَنَ التَّقَحُّمِ وَالمَجَاعَهْ  أَكَلَتْ حَنِيفَةُ رَبَّهَا<br>\
↓ سُوْءَ العَوَاقِبِ وَالتِّبَاعَهْ  لَمْ يَحْذَرُوا مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ<br>\
[Haneefeh ate their lord, in the time of experiencing dearth, or drought, or sterility, and<br>\
hunger: they did not fear, from their lord, the<br>\
evil of the results, and the consequence of their<br>\
action]: for they had taken to themselves a god<br>\
consisting of حَيْس, [i. e. dates mixed with clarified<br>\
butter and the preparation of milk called أَقِط,<br>\
kneaded together,] and worshipped it for some<br>\
time; then famine befell them, and they ate it.<br>\
(S.) And one says, مَا عَلَيْهِ مِنَ اللّٰهِ فِى هٰذَا تَبِعَةٌ,<br>\
and ↓ تِبَاعَةٌ, There is not, against him, on the<br>\
part of God, in this, any claim on account of<br>\
wrong-doing. (TA.)<br>\
تَبِيعٌ [One who is prosecuted, or sued, for a<br>\
right, or due; of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense<br>\
of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, from تَبِعْتُهُ بِحَقِّى;] one<br>\
who owes property to another, (S, K, TA,) and<br>\
whom the latter prosecutes, or sues, for it. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  The young one of a cow in the first year;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) so says Aboo-Fak&#39;as El-Asadee:<br>\
(TA:) or that is a year old; (Az, Mgh, TA;) not<br>\
so called until he has completed the year; erroneously said by Lth to signify a calf ripening to<br>\
his perfect state: (Az, TA:) thus called because<br>\
he yet follows his mother; (Mgh, Msb;) the word<br>\
in this sense being of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the<br>\
sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ: (Msb:) and ↓ تِبْعٌ<br>\
signifies the same: (TA:) fem. of the former<br>\
with ة: (S, Msb, K:) pl. تِبَاعٌ and تَبَائِعٌ; (AA,<br>\
S, O, K;) both pls. of تَبِيعٌ; (AA, S, O;) or the<br>\
former is pl. of تَبِيعَةٌ; (Msb;) and the pl. of<br>\
تَبِيعٌ is أَتْبِعَةٌ [a pl. of pauc.]; (L, Msb;) and<br>\
أَتَابِعُ and أَتَابِيعُ, the latter of which is extr., are<br>\
pls. of أَتْبِعَةٌ: (L:) the pl. of ↓ تِبْعٌ in the abovementioned sense is أَتْبَاعٌ. (TA.) Accord. to EshShaabee, (IF,) One whose horns and ears are<br>\
equal [in length]: (IF, K:) but this is a judicial<br>\
explanation; not deduced from the rules of lexicology. (IF.) ―<br>\
-b2-  I. q. ↓ تَابِعٌ [as signifying One<br>\
who prosecutes, or sues, for a right, or due; and<br>\
particularly for blood-revenge]. (S, K.) Hence<br>\
the saying in the Kur [xvii. 71], ثُمَّ لَا تَجِدُوا لَكُمْ<br>\
عَلَيْنَا بِهِ تَبِيعًا Then ye shall not find for you any<br>\
to prosecute for blood-revenge, nor any to sue,<br>\
against us therein: (Fr. S, K:) or ye shall not<br>\
find for you any to sue us for the disallowing of<br>\
what hath befallen you, nor for our averting it<br>\
from you: (Zj:) [or any aider against us; for]<br>\
تَبِيعٌ also signifies an aider; and especially against<br>\
an enemy. (Lth, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also تَابِعٌ, latter half.<br>\
تِبَاعَةٌ: see تَبِعَةٌ, in three places.<br>\
تُبَّعٌ An appellation of each of the Kings of<br>\
El-Yemen (S, K) who possessed Himyer and<br>\
Hadramowt, (K, TA,) and, as some add, Sebà;<br>\
(TA;) but not otherwise; (K, TA;) and the like<br>\
of this is said in the &#39;Eyn: (TA:) so called<br>\
because they followed one another; whenever one<br>\
died, another took his place, following him in his<br>\
course of acting: (TA:) pl. تَبَابِعَةٌ, (S, K,) with<br>\
ة added as having the meaning of a rel. n.; [as<br>\
though it were pl. of تُبَّعِىٌّ, like as حَنَابِلَةٌ is pl.<br>\
of حَنْبَلِىٌّ;] erroneously written in some of the<br>\
copies of the K تتابعة: (TA:) the تبابعة of<br>\
Himyer were like the أَكَاسِرَة of the Persians and<br>\
the قَيَاصِرَة of the Romans. (Lth.) In the Kur<br>\
xliv. 36, it is said in a trad. to mean a particular<br>\
king, who was a believer, and whose people were<br>\
unbelievers. (Zj.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (TA,) A species<br>\
of the يَعَاسِيب [or kings of the bees], (K,) the<br>\
greatest and most beautiful thereof, whom the<br>\
other bees follow: (TA:) pl. تَبَابِيعُ; (K;) in<br>\
the L, تَتَابِعُ [which is probably a mistranscription<br>\
for تَبَابِعُ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A species of طَيْر [which<br>\
means any flying things, as well as birds; and<br>\
may therefore, perhaps, be meant to indicate what<br>\
next precedes]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The shade, or shadow;<br>\
(S, K;) because it follows the sun; as also ↓ تُبُّعٌ.<br>\
(K.) A poet says, (S,) namely, Soadà El-Juhaneeyeh, (TA,) or Selmà El-Juhaneeyeh, (marginal note in a copy of the S,) bewailing her<br>\
brother, As&#39;ad,<br>\
يَرِدُ المِيَاهُ حَضِيرَةٌ وَنَفِيضَةً<br>\
وِرْدَ القَطَاةِ إِذَا اسْمَأَلَّ التُّبَّعُ<br>\
(S) [He comes to the waters when people are<br>\
dwelling, or staying, there, (but see حَضِيرَةٌ,) and<br>\
when no one is there, as the bird called katáh<br>\
comes to water] when the shade has become contracted at mid-day: or, accord. to Aboo-Leylà,<br>\
the meaning is, the shade of night; i. e., this man<br>\
comes to the waters in the last part of the night,<br>\
before any one: though it means also the shade of<br>\
day-time: (TA:) or, accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed Ed-<br>\
Dareer, the meaning here is [the star, or asterism,<br>\
called] الدَّبَرَان; and this is very probably correct;<br>\
for the bird above mentioned comes to the waters by<br>\
night, and seldom by day; and hence the saying,<br>\
أَدَلُّ مِنْ قَطَاةٍ. (Az, TA.) See تَابِعٌ. ―<br>\
