تَرْقَيْتُهُ, (ISk, JK, S, K,) inf. n. تَرْقَاةٌ,<br>\
(ISk, S, K,) I hit, or hurt, his (a man&#39;s, ISk,<br>\
JK, S) تَرْقُوَة [or collar-bone]. (ISk, JK, S, K.)<br>\
تَرْقُوَةٌ The collar-bone; the bone between the<br>\
pit at the uppermost part of the chest and the<br>\
shoulder, (JK, S, Mgh, K,) on either side, connecting those two parts, (JK, Mgh,) of a man &amp;c.;<br>\
(TA;) each of the two prominent bones in the<br>\
uppermost part of the chest, from the head of<br>\
each shoulder to the edge of the pit above mentioned: (TA in art. ترب:) [and sometimes, as<br>\
in a phrase which see below,] the fore part of<br>\
the حَلْق [here app. meaning the throat], at the<br>\
uppermost part of the chest, the place into which<br>\
the soul [for النَّفَسُ, in copies of the K, I read<br>\
النَّفْسُ] rises [when one is at the point of death]:<br>\
(K in art. رقو:) pl. تراقٍ (JK, Mgh, K) and ترائِق;<br>\
(JK, K;) the latter formed by transposition:<br>\
(JK:) Fr says that the latter pl. is used by some<br>\
for the former: (TA:) the sing. is of the measure<br>\
فَعْلُوَةٌ, (JK, S, K,) as is shown by the verb mentioned above, (K,) though it is repeated in the<br>\
K in art. رقو: (TA:) one should not say تُرْقُوَةٌ,<br>\
with damm to the ت. (S K.) إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ,<br>\
in the Kur lxxv. 26, means When it (the soul)<br>\
reaches the uppermost parts of the chest; [or,<br>\
the parts of the throat next the chest;] for النَّفْسُ<br>\
is understood: (Bd:) said when one is at the<br>\
point of death. (TA.)<br>\
تِرْيَاقٌ, an arabicized word, (S, Msb, K,) from<br>\
the Greek, (Msb, K,) [i. e. from<br>\
θηρια� degreesὰ,] or originally Persian, (S, O,) also written and pronounced<br>\
دِرْيَاقٌ, (JK, Msb,) and طِرْيَاقٌ; (Msb;) or, as<br>\
some say, from الرِّيقُ, because containing the<br>\
spittle of serpents, and, if so, it is Arabic [in<br>\
origin]: (Msb:) [Theriac; also called treacle;]<br>\
an antidote for poisons; (S, O;) a certain compound medicine, (K,) comprising many ingredients, at most ninety or ninety-six, and at least<br>\
sixty-four, (TA,) sometimes including the flesh of<br>\
vipers, (K, TA,) and that of asses, which cause it<br>\
to be prohibited and impure, or, as some say, it is<br>\
prohibited without restriction: (TA:) it is a<br>\
remedy against the bite or sting of rapacious<br>\
venomous reptiles and the like, and poisonous<br>\
potions: (K: [I omit some unprofitable and<br>\
absurd particulars respecting the compounds thus<br>\
termed, in the K and other lexicons &amp;c.:]) pl.<br>\
تَرَايِيقُ. (K in art. فرق.) The best kind is called<br>\
التِّرْيَاقُ الفَارُوقُ, (K in art. فرق,) vulgarly تِرْيَاقٌ<br>\
فَارُوقِىٌّ. (TA in that art.) [A principal ingredient<br>\
of this kind is the best sort of Jews-pitch, i. e.<br>\
asphaltum, also called mumia, and in Arabic<br>\
مُومِيَا:) (see De Sacy&#39;s “ Rel. de l&#39;Égypte par Abdallatif,” ” p. 274:) and this mumia, by itself, is<br>\
called التِّرْيَاقُ التُّرْكِىُّ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is sometimes applied to Treacle, as meaning the sirop that drains<br>\
from sugar.] It is also said to be applied to the<br>\
فَادْزَهْر [or Bezoar-stone], likewise termed مَسُوسٌ.<br>\
(TA in art. مس.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, and ↓ تِرْيَاقَةٌ, (assumed tropical:)  Wine;<br>\
(S, O, K;) because it dispels anxiety; (S;) or<br>\
because it is a remedy for anxieties; (O;) wherefore it is also termed صَابُونُ الهُمُومِ. (TA.)<br>\
تِرْيَاقَةٌ: see the last sentence above.<br>\
