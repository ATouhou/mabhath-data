تتوّج He was, or became, crowned, or invested with the crown. (S, A, K.) [For the verb<br>\
تَاجَ, in this or a similar sense, mentioned in the<br>\
Lexicons of Golius and Freytag, in the former as<br>\
from the K, I find no authority: on the contrary,<br>\
it is said in the TA that no verb answering to<br>\
تَائِجٌ has been heard.] ―<br>\
-b2-  He was made, or became,<br>\
a prince, lord, or chief. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  He was, or<br>\
became, turbaned, or invested with the turban.<br>\

تَاجٌ A crown; (S, A, K, TA;) i. e. a thing<br>\
that is made for kings, of gold and jewels; (TA;)<br>\
peculiar to the عَجَم [or Persians and other<br>\
foreigners]: (Msb:) [a Persian word:] pl. [of<br>\
mult.] تِيجَانٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and [of pauc.]<br>\
أَتْوَاجٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A turban; as being likened<br>\
to a crown. (TA.) It is said in a trad., (TA,)<br>\
العَمَائِمُ تِيجَانُ العَرَبِ [Turbans are the crowns of<br>\
the Arabs]; (S, TA;) i. e. turbans are to the<br>\
Arabs as crowns to the kings; for the Arabs in<br>\
the deserts are [or were] mostly bare-headed or<br>\
wearing قَلَانِس [pl. of قَلَنْسُوَةٌ, q. v.]; turbans<br>\
among them being few. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Silver.<br>\
(TA.) [See what next follows.]<br>\
تَاجَةٌ An ingot of purified silver: originally<br>\
تَازَهْ, a Persian word, applied to a dirhem recently<br>\
coined. (TA.)<br>\
تَائِجٌ Having a تَاج [i. e. crown, or (assumed tropical:)  turban];<br>\
an epithet applied to an إِمَام: (K:) it is a possessive epithet, like دَارِعٌ, for we have not heard<br>\
any verb answering to it. (TA.)<br>\
مُتَوَّجٌ Crowned; applied to a king: (A, TA:)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  made a prince, lord, or chief: (assumed tropical:)  turbaned. (TA.)<br>\
مَتَاوِجُ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned,] occurring in the saying of Jendel Er-Rá&#39;ee,<br>\
وَهُنَّ يَعْمِينَ مِنَ المَلَامِجِ<br>\
بِقَرِدٍ مُخْرَنْطِمِ المَتَاوِجِ<br>\
signifies [properly The parts of the head] where<br>\
one is crowned (حَيْثُ يُتَتَوَّجُ) with the turban:<br>\
(K,* TA:) [but it is evidently here used in a<br>\
tropical manner; the poet is speaking of she-camels:] the ملامج are the mouths; [or the parts<br>\
around the mouths;] and the قَرِد, a word like<br>\
كَتِف, is the accumulated foam which the camel<br>\
casts forth from his mouth. (TA.) [It seems<br>\
that the poet means, And they cast forth, from<br>\
the parts around the mouth, accumulated foam,<br>\
elongated in the extremities: مُخْرَنْطِم being app.<br>\
syn. with مُخَرْطَم, as meaning “ elongated like<br>\
a خُرْطُوم,” or “ snout. ”]<br>\
