اتوى, said of a man, signifies جَآءَ تَوًّا, i. e.<br>\
He came alone; by himself: opposed to أَزْوَى<br>\
meaning “ he came with another. ” (T.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also art. توى.<br>\
تَوٌّ [app. from the Persian تُوْ, meaning “ a fold,”<br>\
or “ a single fold,”,] One, and no more; single; sole.<br>\
(T, S, M, K.) You say, كَانَ تَوًّا فَصَارَ زَوًّا He,<br>\
or it, was one only, and became a pair. (TA.) And<br>\
it is said in a trad., الطَّوَافُ تَوٌّ وَالاِسْتِجْمَارُ تَوٌّ, (S,<br>\
TA,) i. e., The circuiting [of the Kaabeh] is one<br>\
action, and the casting of the pebbles [in the valley of<br>\
Minè] is one action. (TA.) You say also, جَآءَ تَوٌّا,<br>\
meaning He came alone; by himself: (T, S, M:)<br>\
or he came by a direct course, nothing making<br>\
him to deviate, and not stopping anywhere in the<br>\
road; for if he stop anywhere in the road, he is<br>\
not said to be توّ. (AZ, A&#39;Obeyd, M, K.) And<br>\
عَقَدْتُهُ بِتَوٍّ وَاحِدٍ I tied it with a single knot; by<br>\
turning the cord, or the like, once: so says AZ;<br>\
and he cites the following ex.:<br>\
جَارِيَةٌ لَيْسَتْ مِنَ الوَحْشَنِّ<br>\
لَا تَعْقِدُ المَنْطَقَ بِالمُشْتَنِّ<br>\
إِلَّا بِتَوٍّ وَاحِدٍ أَوْ تَنِّ<br>\
i. e., [A girl that is not of the wild, or shy, sort:<br>\
she does not tie the zone with the fist, but with a<br>\
single knot, or] half a knot: the ن in تَنّ [and in<br>\
وَحْشَنّ and مُشْتَنّ] is redundant: تَنّ being originally تَ, which is a contraction [or rather the<br>\
half, both as to the letter and the meaning,] of<br>\
تَوّ. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A rope that is twisted of a single<br>\
strand: pl. أَتْوَآءٌ. (T, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [It is said that]<br>\
it signifies also A thousand horses, or horsemen.<br>\
(AZ, T, K.) [But this requires consideration:<br>\
for] one says, وَجَّهَ فُلَانٌ مِنْ خَيْلِهِ بِأَلْفٍ تَوٍّ, (AZ,<br>\
T, S,) meaning [Such a one sent a troop of his<br>\
horses] with a thousand men; i. e., with one<br>\
thousand: (S, TA:) or, as some say, with one<br>\
complete thousand. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also One who is<br>\
unoccupied by the business of the present world<br>\
and of the world to come. (AA, T, K. *)<br>\
-A3-  Also<br>\
A structure elevated, reared, or erected. (T, K.)<br>\
تَوَّةٌ A period, or a short period, (سَاعَةٌ, AA,<br>\
T, K,) of time. (AA, T.) You say, مَضَتْ تَوَّةٌ<br>\
مِنَ اللَّيْلِ, and النَّهَار, A period, or a short period,<br>\
(ساعة,) of the night passed, and of the day. (TA.)<br>\
And مَا مَضَى إِلَّا حَتَّى كَانَ كَذَا There passed<br>\
not save a short period (ساعة) to the time that<br>\
such a thing happened. (IAar, T.) Hence the<br>\
saying of the vulgar, تَوَّةً قَامَ [commonly pronounced تَوَّهْ] Just now (السَّاعَةَ) he rose, or stood.<br>\
