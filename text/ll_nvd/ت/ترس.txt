a thing to be as a تُرْس; he defended, or protected,<br>\
himself with it. (Msb.) You say also, تَسَتَّرْتُ بِكَ<br>\
مِنَ الحَدَثَانِ فَتَتَرَّسْتُ مِنْ نِبَالِ الزَّمَانِ (tropical:)  [I protected<br>\

تُرْسٌ [A shield;] a certain piece of defensive<br>\
armour; (M, TA;) a thing well known: (A,<br>\
Msb, K:) pl. تِرَسَةٌ and تِرَاسٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and<br>\
تِرَاسَةٌ (S) and تُرُوسٌ, [all pls. of mult.,] and أَتْرَاسٌ,<br>\
[a pl. of pauc.,] (S, M, Msb, K,) but not أَتْرِسَةٌ.<br>\
(ISk, S, Msb.) A تُرْس that is made of skins,<br>\
without wood and without sinews in it, is called<br>\
حَجَفَةٌ and دَرَقَةٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  The disk of<br>\
the sun. (A, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A smooth, round,<br>\
level piece of ground: (A, TA:) or a rugged<br>\
piece of hard, or hard and level, ground. (Ibn-<br>\

-b4-  See also مَتَرْسٌ.<br>\
تِرَاسَةٌ The art of making shields. (K.)<br>\
تَرَّاسٌ A man having a shield; (S, M, A, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ تَارِسٌ. (S, A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A maker of<br>\
shields. (K.)<br>\
تَارِسٌ: see تَرَّاسٌ.<br>\
مَتَرْسٌ; so accord. to El-Háfidh Ibn-Hajar, and<br>\
this is the correct form; written in the T and the<br>\
Towsheeh مَتَّرْسٌ; and by some, مَتْرَسٌ [as in the<br>\
CK]; and by some, مَتْرَسٌ [as I find it in two<br>\
copies of the S and in a copy of the K]; (TA;)<br>\
[A wooden door-bar;] a piece of wood that is put<br>\
behind the door; (S, K) the شِجَار [or wooden<br>\
bar] that is put against the door as a stay: (T,<br>\
L, TA:) [مَتَرْسْ is] a Persian word, [having the<br>\
above-mentioned signification, but originally a<br>\
contraction of مَهْ تَرْسْ, and] meaning “ fear not<br>\
thou,” with it [being here understood]: (T, K,<br>\
TA:) or the name of this piece of wood in Arabic<br>\
is ↓ تُرْسٌ: (M, TA:) which also signifies a piece<br>\
of wood with which a couch-frame (سَرِير) is<br>\
repaired, by its being affixed as a ضَبَّة: (M:)<br>\
[and the Arabic word شِجَارٌ has this latter signification also:] the Persian word is مَتَرْسْ. (M,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Their saying مَتَرْس, with fet-h to the م<br>\
and ت, and sukoon to the ر means [also] Security<br>\
[is given] to thee, therefore fear thou not: it is<br>\
said to be Persian. (Msb.)<br>\
مَتْرَسَةٌ, (M, A,) or متْرَسَةٌ, (K, accord. to the<br>\
TA, [and so I find in a MS. copy of that work,<br>\
and in the CK, but the former is probably the<br>\
correct form, being agreeable with analogy, like<br>\
مَبْخَلَةٌ and مَجْبَنَةٌ &amp;c.,]) Anything by which one<br>\
is defended, or protected. (M, Msb, K.) You<br>\
say also هُوَ مَتْرَسَةٌ لَكَ (tropical:)  [He is a cause of defence,<br>\
or protection, to thee]. (A.)<br>\
بَابٌ مَتْرُوسٌ A door fastened, or closed, [with a<br>\
bar, or] in any manner. (TA.)<br>\
