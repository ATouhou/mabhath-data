تَبڤ3َ [تَبَّ, aor.<br>\
تَبِ3َ, inf. n. تَبٌّ, and perhaps ↓ تَبَبٌ<br>\
and ↓ تَبَابٌ and ↓ تَبِيبٌ, He, or it, suffered loss, or<br>\
diminution; or became lost: and perished, or<br>\
died: as also ↓ تبّب, inf. n. تَتْبِيبٌ: and app. تُبَّ<br>\
also.] تَبٌّ (M, A, K) and ↓ تَتْبِيبٌ (M, K) [as<br>\
inf. ns.] signify The suffering loss, or diminution;<br>\
or being lost: and perishing, or dying: or [used<br>\
as substs.] loss, or diminution; or the state of<br>\
being lost: and perdition, or death: (M, * A,<br>\
K: *) and so ↓ تَبَابٌ, (T, S, A, Msb, K,) [said to<br>\
be] a subst. from تَبَّبَهُ, with teshdeed, (Msb,) and<br>\
↓ تَبَبٌ and ↓ تَبِيبٌ: (K:) or the last three signify<br>\
[simply] perdition, or death: (M:) and ↓ تَتْبِيبٌ<br>\
is explained as signifying loss, or diminution, that<br>\
brings, or leads, to perdition or death; (IAth,<br>\
TA;) and so ↓ تَبَابٌ; (Bd in cxi. 1;) and the<br>\
causing to perish. (T, TA.) Hence you say,<br>\
↓ تَبَّ تَبَابًا [meaning, in an emphatic manner, May<br>\
he suffer loss, or be lost, or perish]. (S.) And<br>\
تَبًّا لَهُ May God decree to him loss, or perdition;<br>\
or cause loss, or perdition, to cleave to him: (S,<br>\
M, * Msb, * K: *) تَبًّا being in the accus. case as<br>\
an inf. n. governed by a verb understood. (S.)<br>\
And ↓ تَبًّا تَبِيبًا, [in the CK تَتْبِيبًا,] meaning the<br>\

M, K,) and تَبَّتْ يَدُهُ, aor.<br>\
تَبِ3َ, (Msb,) inf. n. تَبٌّ<br>\
and ↓ تَبَابٌ, but IDrd says that the former of these<br>\
seems to be the inf. n., and the latter the simple<br>\
subst., (M,) May his arms, or hands, and his<br>\
arm, or hand, suffer loss, or be lost, or perish:<br>\
(T, M, Msb, K, and Bd in cxi. 1:) or (tropical:)  may he himself suffer loss, &amp;c., (Msb, * and Bd ubi suprà,)<br>\
i. e., (tropical:)  his whole person: (Jel in cxi. 1:) or (tropical:)  his<br>\
good in the present life and that in the life to<br>\
come. (Bd ubi suprà.) ―<br>\

A, K:) the loss of youth being likened to تَبَابَ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

ride upon, or easy and direct. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  It (an<br>\
affair) was, or became, rightly disposed or arranged;<br>\
in a right state: (S, M, A, Msb:) or it followed<br>\
a regular, or right, course; was in a right state;<br>\
and clear, or plain: from مُسْتَتِبٌّ applied to a<br>\
road, explained below: (T, TA:) or it became<br>\
complete, and in a right state: lit. it demanded<br>\

termed مَفَازَة]. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  [It is also said in the K<br>\
to signify What the ribs infold: but I think it<br>\
probable that this meaning has been assigned to<br>\
it from its having been found erroneously written<br>\
