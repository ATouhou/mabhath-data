called تَنُّور. (M, K.)<br>\
تَنُّورٌ A sort of كَانُون [or fire-place]; (M;)<br>\
the thing, (S, Msb,) or كانون, (K,) in which<br>\
bread is baked; (S, Msb, K;) but different from<br>\
the فُرْن: (S in art. فرن:) [it is a kind of oven,<br>\
open at the top, in the bottom of which a fire is<br>\
lighted, and in which the bread, in the form of<br>\
flat cakes, is generally stuck against the sides;<br>\
either portable, and made of baked clay, wide at<br>\
the bottom, and narrow at the top, where it is<br>\
open; and if so, the bread is sometimes stuck<br>\
upon the outside, to bake; or fixed, and in this<br>\
case made of baked clay likewise, or constructed<br>\
of bricks; or it is a hole made in the ground, and<br>\
lined with bricks or tiles or the like, against which<br>\
the bread is stuck, to bake; and sometimes flesh-meat, cut into small pieces, is roasted in it, or<br>\
upon it, on skewers:] such, accord. to some, is the<br>\
meaning in the Kur xi. 42 and xxiii. 27; (T;)<br>\
and the word is said to have the same meaning<br>\
in every language; (Lth, T, M;) but this is<br>\
not correct: (Ham p. 793:) it is an arabicized<br>\
word; (T, M;) not genuine Arabic; (AHát,<br>\
Msb;) originally Persian: (M:) [in Hebrew<br>\
XXX:] Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà [i. e. Th, as is stated<br>\
in Ham, ubi suprà,] says that it is of the measure<br>\
تَفْعُولٌ from النَّار, (M, and Ham ubi suprà,) or<br>\
from النُّور; originally تَنْوُورٌ; (Ham;) but this is<br>\
wrong: (M:) the pl. is تَنَانِيرُ. (M, Msb.) Mo-<br>\
hammad is related to have said to a man wearing<br>\
a garment dyed with bastard-saffron, “If thy<br>\
garment were in the تنّور of thy family, or beneath<br>\
their cooking-pot, it were better: ” whereupon he<br>\
went away, and burned it: but he meant, “Wert<br>\
thou to spend its price for flour to make bread,<br>\
or for fire-wood with which to cook, it were better<br>\
for thee: ” as though he disliked a garment so<br>\
dyed. (IAth.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The surface of the ground:<br>\
(T, S, M, K:) so in the Kur ubi suprà, (T, S,)<br>\
accord. to &#39;Alee (S) and I&#39;Ab. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The<br>\
highest part of the earth or ground: so in the same<br>\
passages of the Kur accord. to Katádeh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
Any place from which water pours forth. (M, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  A place where the water of a valley collects.<br>\
(M, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  The shining of the dawn: so accord.<br>\
to some in the Kur ubi suprà: (T:) and &#39;Alee is<br>\
related to have said that وَفَارَ التَّنُّورُ means and<br>\
daybreak rose or rises: (TA:) or it relates to the<br>\
welling forth of water from the place of the<br>\
mosque of El-Koofeh: (T:) or التّنّور here signifies a well-known spring of water: (Hr, TA:)<br>\
or a certain mountain near El-Maseesah; (I&#39;Ab,<br>\
K, TA;) i. e., (TA,) &#39;Eyn-el-Ward, in El-Jezeereh;<br>\
(I&#39;Ab, T, TA;) or &#39;Eyn-Wardeh. (Bd in xi. 42.)<br>\
