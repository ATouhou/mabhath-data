load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'تحتتَحْت is the contr. of فَوْق: (Msb, K:) and<br>\
التَّحْتُ [signifying The location that is beneath,<br>\
below, or under,] is opposed to الفَوْقُ, and is used<br>\
in relation to that which is separate from another<br>\
thing; الأَسْفَلُ being used in relation to that which<br>\
is united with [or a part of] another thing. (Kull.)<br>\
Sometimes, (K,) تَحْت is an adv. n., (Msb, K,)<br>\
having a vague signification, its meaning not<br>\
being clear unless it is prefixed to another word,<br>\
as in the phrase هٰذَا تَحْتَ هٰذَا [This is beneath,<br>\
below, or under, this]. (Msb.) And sometimes,<br>\
it is a simple noun; (K;) in which case, [not<br>\
having the article ال,] it is indecl., with dammeh<br>\
for its termination, (K, and I&#39;Ak p. 204,) provided that the noun to which it should be prefixed is suppressed, and the meaning of this is<br>\
intended to be understood, but not the word itself;<br>\
(I&#39;Ak ubi suprà;) as in مِنْ تَحْتُ [Beneath,<br>\
below, or under]; (K;) and in the saying,<br>\
أَقَبٌ مِنْ تَحْتُ عَرِيضٌ مِنْ عَلُ<br>\
[Lean beneath; broad above]: otherwise, it is<br>\
decl.; (I&#39;Ak ibid.;) as in تَجْرِي مِنْ تَحْتِهَا الأَنْهَارُ<br>\
[Rivers running beneath them]; (Kur ii. 23, &amp;c.;)<br>\
i.e., beneath their trees, (Bd, Jel,) and their<br>\
pavilions. (Jel.) [You say also, فُلَانٌ تَحْتَ أَمْرِ<br>\
فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is under the command, rule, or<br>\
authority, of such a one. And فُلَانٌ تَحْتَهُ فُلَانَةُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Such a one has as his wife such a woman: see<br>\
an ex. in a verse cited voce إِذَا. The dim. is<br>\
↓ تُحَيْت: you say, هٰدَا تُحَيْتَ هٰذَا, and مِنْ تُحَيْتِ<br>\
هٰذَا, This is a little beneath, below, or under,<br>\
this.] ―<br>\
-b2-  التَّحْتُ is also the sing. of التُّحُوتُ,<br>\
(IAth, TA,) which latter [in the CK erroneously<br>\
written التُّحُتُ] signifies The low, base, vile, or<br>\
ignoble, persons. (A, IAth, K.) It is said in a<br>\
trad., لَا تَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى تَظْهَرَ التُّحُوتُ وَ تَهْلِكَ<br>\
الوُعُولُ, i. e. [The hour of resurrection will not<br>\
come until] the low, or ignoble, persons [shall<br>\
prevail], and the noble persons [shall perish]:<br>\
(A, IAth, TA:) or, as some say, until the treasures that are beneath the earth appear. (TA.)<br>\
And in another trad. it is said that among the<br>\
signs of the resurrection shall be this: أَنْ يَعْلُو<br>\
التُّحُوتُ الوُعُولَ That the weak of mankind shall<br>\
have ascendency over the strong. (TA.)<br>\
تَحْتَانِىٌّ [Of, or relating to, the location that<br>\
is beneath, below, or under; inferior; lower;]<br>\
rel. n. of تَحْت, like as فَوْقَانِىٌّ is of فَوْق: ا and ن<br>\
being very often added in the rel. n. (TA.)<br>\
