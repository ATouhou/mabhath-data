S, K:) and low, or depressed, land or ground:<br>\
(AO, S, Msb, K:) thus bearing two contr. significations, (S, K,) accord. to AO: (S:) or it<br>\
has not these significations, but means a water-course from the upper part of a valley to its<br>\
lower part; therefore sometimes its upper part<br>\
is described [by this name], and sometimes its<br>\
lower part; (IAar, IB, TA:) or it has the second<br>\
of the significations above, (Msb, K,) and the<br>\
first, (K,) and signifies also a water-course (Msb,<br>\
K) from the upper part of a valley: (Msb:) and<br>\
also, (K,) or, accord. to IDrd, (TA,) the wide<br>\
part of the mouth of a valley: and a high, or an<br>\
elevated, piece of land or ground: (IDrd, K:)<br>\
sometimes, says IDrd, it has this last application;<br>\
but the former is the original signification: (TA:)<br>\
it is also said to signify high, or elevated, and<br>\
rugged, land or ground, in which the torrent goes<br>\
to and fro, and from which it then pours to<br>\
another تلعة, lower than it; and which is fertile<br>\
in plants, or herbage: (L, TA:) or a water-course from the higher part of the ground to the<br>\
bottom of a valley: (AA, S:) pl. تِلَاعٌ (AA, S,<br>\
Msb, K) and تَلَعَاتٌ: (K:) and, (K,) or, accord.<br>\
to Sh, (TA,) تِلَاعٌ signifies water-course flowing<br>\
from acclivities and the [eminences termed] نِجَاف<br>\
and the mountains, until they pour into the valley:<br>\
(Sh, K:) to which Sh adds, the تلعة of the mountain being formed by the water&#39;s coming and furrowing and excavating it until it escapes from it:<br>\
(TA:) but تلاع are nowhere except [the word<br>\
إِلّاَ has been dropped in the CK] in the صَحَارَى<br>\
[or deserts]; (Sh, K;) and sometimes a تلعة comes<br>\
from a distance of five leagues (فَرَاسِخ) to the<br>\
valley; and when it flows from the mountains, and<br>\
falls into the صحارى [or deserts], it excavates<br>\
in them what resembles a moat: when it becomes<br>\
so large as to be like the half, or two thirds, of<br>\
the valley, it is termed مَيْثَآءُ: (Sh, TA:) تَلْعَةٌ is<br>\
also said to be like رحبة [i. e. رَحَبَةٌ or رَحْبَةٌ,<br>\
app. as meaning the part of a valley in which its<br>\
water flows into it from its two sides]; and the<br>\
pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] is said to be تَلْعٌ.<br>\
(TA.) It is said in a trad., فَيَجِىْءُ مَطَرٌ لَا يَمْتَنِعُ<br>\
مِنْهُ ذَنَبُ تَلْعَةٍ [And a rain will come, in consequence of which the end of a water-course will<br>\
not be impeded]: meaning to denote its abundance,<br>\
and that no place will be exempt from it. (TA.)<br>\
And in a prov., فُلَانٌ لَا يَمْنَعُ ذَنَبَ تَلْعَةٍ [Such<br>\
a one will not impede the end of a water-course]:<br>\
(K, * TA:) applied to the abject and contemptible.<br>\
(K.) And in another, (ISh,) لَا أَثِقُ بِسَيْلِ تَلْعَتكَ<br>\
[I do not, or will not, trust in the flow of thy<br>\
water-course]: applied to him in whom one does<br>\
not trust: (ISh, K:) i. e. I do not, or will not,<br>\
trust in what thou sayest, and what thou adducest:<br>\
characterizing the person as a liar. (ISh.) And<br>\
in another, (IAar,) مَا أَخَافُ إِلَّا مِنْ سَيْلِ تَلْعَتِى<br>\
[I fear not save from the flow of my water-course]: i. e., from the sons of my uncle, and my<br>\
relations: (IAar, K:) for he who descends the<br>\
water-course is in danger: if the torrent come, it<br>\
sweeps him away. (IAar.)<br>\
