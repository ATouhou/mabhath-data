تَرْجَمَهُ, (S in art. رجم, and Msb and K<br>\
in the present art.,) and تَرْجَمَ عَنْهُ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَرْجَمَةٌ, (KL,) He interpreted it, (S, Msb, KL,<br>\
K,) or explained it in another language; (S,<br>\
Msb, KL;) namely, the speech, or language, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) of another person: (Msb:) or, as some<br>\
say, translated it from one language into another:<br>\
(TA:) and he explained it; namely, his own<br>\
speech. (Msb.) [This verb is essentially the same<br>\
in Arabic, Chaldee, and Ethiopic.] ―<br>\
-b2-  تَرْجَمَهُ, inf. n.<br>\
as above, also signifies He wrote his life; wrote<br>\
a biography, or biographical notice, of him. (TA,<br>\
passim; and other works of post-classical times.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Accord. to the K, the ت in this verb is a<br>\
radical: but see تَرْجُمَانٌ, below. (TA.)<br>\
تَرْجَمَةٌ [inf. n. of the verb above: used as a<br>\
simple subst., An interpretation: a translation:<br>\
pl. تَرَاجِمُ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also] A life, or biography, or biographical notice, of any person: pl. as above.<br>\
(TA, passim; and other works of post-classical<br>\
times.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And An article, a head, chapter, section, or paragraph, of a book. (TA, passim;<br>\
and other works of post-classical times.)<br>\
تَرْجُمَانٌ and تُرْجُمَانٌ and تَرْجَمَانٌ, (S in art.<br>\
رجم, and Msb and K in the present art.,) of<br>\
which three dial. vars. the first is the best, (Msb,)<br>\
and is that which commonly obtains, (TA,) An<br>\
interpreter; (S, Msb, K;) an explainer of speech<br>\
in another language: (S, Msb:) [a translator:<br>\
(see the verb, above:)] pl. تَرَاجِمُ and تَرَاجِمَةٌ;<br>\
which latter favours the opinion of those who<br>\
hold the word to be of foreign origin. (S, Msb.)<br>\
The ت and م are [said to be] radicals; but J<br>\
makes the ت to be augmentative, and ترجمان<br>\
is mentioned in the T [as well as in the S] in art.<br>\
رجم, though the author of the T has mentioned<br>\
the verb among quadriliteral-radical words; and<br>\
there is a reason [for deriving it from رَجَمَ], for<br>\
one says لِسَانٌ يَرْجُمُ meaning “ a tongue that is<br>\
chaste, or perspicuous, and copious, in speech: ”<br>\
most, however, hold the ت to be a radical.<br>\
(Msb.) It is said in the K that the verb shows<br>\
the ت to be radical; whereas J and AHei and<br>\
IKt hold it to be augmentative; but there is a<br>\
difference of opinion whether it be from الرَّجْمُ<br>\
بِالحِجَارَةِ [the throwing stones], or from الرَّجْمُ<br>\
بِالغَيْبِ [the conjecturing, or speaking conjecturally]; and also whether it be Arabic, or arabicized from درغمان [a word which I do not know<br>\
in Persian nor in any other language]: (MF,<br>\
TA:) if arabicized, the present is its proper place.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُتَرْجَمٌ [Interpreted: or translated. ―<br>\
-b2-  And also<br>\
The subject of a biography, or biographical notice.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And] (assumed tropical:)  Confused, or dubious. (Har p. 537.)<br>\
