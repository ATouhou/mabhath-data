تَنَمَ, (M, K, [in the CK, erroneously, تَنَوَّمَ,])<br>\
without teshdeed to the ن, (M, TA,) He (a<br>\
camel) ate the تَنُّوم. (M, K.)<br>\
تَنُّومٌ A kind of trees (S, M, K) having a small<br>\
fruit, (S, M,) like that of the خِرْوَع [or castor-oil<br>\
plant], (M,) which, bursting, discloses grains, that<br>\
are eaten by the people of the desert: (S, M:)<br>\
as the sun declines, it follows it with the [upper]<br>\
sides of its leaves: (M:) its fruit, with حُرْف,<br>\
(K,) i. e. حَبُّ الرَّشَادِ [q. v.], (TA,) and water,<br>\
drunk, expels worms; and the application of its<br>\
leaves, with vinegar, in the manner of a poultice,<br>\
draws forth warts: (K:) n. un. with ة: (S, M,<br>\
K:) AHn says, it is a kind of dust-coloured trees,<br>\
of those termed أَغْلَاث, eaten by ostriches and<br>\
gazelles, and of those among which gazelles are<br>\
snared: its grain, when the coverings thereof<br>\
open, becomes black; and it has a root (عِرْق),<br>\
sometimes made into a زَنْد [for producing fire]:<br>\
the places where it grows are mostly the sides of<br>\
valleys: IAar says, the تنّومة is a tree of the kind<br>\
called جَنْبَة, of large size, in which grow grains<br>\
like hemp-seed, used for ointment, and as a seasoning, or condiment: it dries up at the beginning of<br>\
winter, and disappears: all this is from AHn:<br>\
(M:) A&#39;Obeyd says, it is one of the plants of the<br>\
earth, in which, and in the fruit whereof, is a<br>\
blackness: it is eaten by the ostrich: the pl. [or<br>\
coll. gen. n.] is تَنُّومٌ: (T: the author of which<br>\
then adds,) I say, it is a tree which I have seen<br>\
in the desert: the colour of its leaves inclines to<br>\
blackness, and it has grains like hemp-seed, or a<br>\
little larger: I have seen the women of the desert<br>\
bruise its grains, and express from them a blue<br>\
oil, in which is a viscosity; and they anoint their<br>\
hair with it when they comb themselves: AA says,<br>\
the تنّوم has a grain which is oily and dustcoloured: En-Nadr says, the تنّومة is of an ill<br>\
savour, and the beasts do not like it, or eat much<br>\
of it: (T:) [it is erroneously said in the K, voce<br>\
طُلَّامٌ, to be hemp-seed (حَبُّ الشَّاهْدَانِج): and]<br>\
some say that it is the hemp-plant (شجر الشهدانج).<br>\
(Ham p. 135.) The sun, when eclipsed, is<br>\
said in a trad. to have become black, and like a<br>\
تنّومة. (T.) And a poet, who married a woman,<br>\
and found her to be pretty, but with hoary hair,<br>\
and who had a youthful wife at his abode, likens<br>\
the hair of the former to the flower of the أُقْحُوَان,<br>\
and black hair to تنّوم; saying<br>\
وَلَمَّا رَأَيْتُ الأُقْحُوَانَ مُنَوِّرًا<br>\
وَلَمْ أَرَ تَنُّومًا تَذَكَّرْتُ مَنْزِلِى<br>\
[And when I saw the chamomile flowering, and<br>\
saw not tennoom, I remembered my abode]. (Ham<br>\
ubi suprà.)<br>\
