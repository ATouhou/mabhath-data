مُسَيَّحٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  ذُو كِسَآءٍ, as opposed to ذُوبُرْدٍ, (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
poor man. (S, art. عج.) [The كساء was<br>\
evidently a simple oblong piece of cloth; for<br>\
الكِسَائِى is said to have been thus named because<br>\
he wore a كساء while in the state of إِحْرَام; as<br>\
is mentioned in the TA, art. كسو; but it seems<br>\
to have been sometimes sewed in the manner of<br>\
the عَبَآء, which see; and see also مُسَيَّحٌ, and بُرْدٌ.]<br>\
It is [properly] not one of the garments which<br>\
are cut and sewed [but is a single piece]: (Mgh,<br>\
art. قطع:) [a wrapper, or wrapping garment,<br>\
of a single piece]. ―<br>\
-b3-  رَكِبَ كِسَآءَهُ<br>\
He fell upon<br>\
the back of his neck. (IAar, in TA, art. ردع.)<br>\
