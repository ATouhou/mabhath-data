تَآءَمَ أَخَاهُ, (K, TA, [in the TT, as from the<br>\
M, written تَأَمَ, and so by Golius,]) inf. n. مُتَآءَمَةٌ,<br>\
(TA,) He was twinborn with his brother. (M,<br>\
K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تآءم, (S,) or تآءم ثَوْبًا, (M, K, TA,<br>\
[in the TT, again, written تَأَمَ,]) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(S, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He wove a piece of cloth of threads<br>\
two and two together (S, M, K) in its warp and<br>\
its woof. (K.) [See مِتْآمٌ, and see also نِيرٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
تآءم الفَرَسُ, (K, [written by Golius تَأَمَ,]) inf. n.<br>\
as above, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  The horse fetched run after<br>\
run. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَتْأَمَتْ She (a mother, K, or a woman, S,<br>\
M, Msb, and any pregnant animal, M) twinned,<br>\
or brought forth two at one birth. (T, S, M,<br>\
Msb, K.)<br>\
-A2-  أَتْأَمَهَا i. q. أَفْضَاهَا [like آتَمَهَا, q. v.<br>\
in art. اتم]. (S, K.) [Golius and Freytag have<br>\
rendered it as though it meant أَفْضَى إِلَيْهَا.]<br>\
تِئْمٌ, whence هُوَ تِئْمُهُ: see تَوْءَمٌ.<br>\
تَئِيمٌ, whence هُوَ تَئِيمُهُ: see تَوْءَمٌ.<br>\
تُؤَامِيَّةٌ A pearl; (M, K;) so called in relation<br>\
to تُؤَامٌ, (TA,) which is a town twenty leagues<br>\
from the metropolis of &#39;Omán, (K, TA,) in the<br>\
tract next the sea, (TA,) a city of &#39;Omán whence<br>\
pearls are purchased, (M,) erroneously called by<br>\
J تَوْءَمٌ, [but in one copy of the S I find it written<br>\
تُوام,] and said by him to be the metropolis of<br>\
&#39;Omán; (K;) as also ↓ تَوْءَمِيَّةٌ, (TA, [and thus<br>\
it is written in copies of the S, but in one copy I<br>\
find it written تُوامِيَّة,]) thought by En-Nejeeremee<br>\
to be thus called in relation to the oyster-shell,<br>\
because this is always what is termed تَوْءَمٌ, q. v.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
تَوْءَمٌ A twin; one of two young, (S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) and of more, (M, K,) brought forth at<br>\
one birth, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) of any animals;<br>\
whether a male or a female, or a male [brought<br>\
forth] with a female; (M, K;) and تَوْءَمَةٌ is<br>\
[also] applied to a female: (S, M, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K:) it occurs in poetry contracted into تَوَمٌ:<br>\
(M:) the pl. is تَوَائِمُ and تُؤَامٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
the latter of which is of a rare form, not without<br>\
parallels, (M,) said by some to be a quasi-pl. n.,<br>\
and by some to be originally [تِئَامٌ,] with kesr,<br>\
but the assertion of these last is condemned by<br>\
AHei; (MF;) and تَوْءَمُونَ is allowable as applied<br>\
to human beings: (S, TA:) you say, هُوَ تَوْءَمُهُ<br>\
[in the TA, erroneously, تُؤْمُهُ, with damm,] and<br>\
↓ تِئْمُهُ and ↓ تَئِيمُهُ [in the CK تَيْئمُهُ] (AZ, M,<br>\
K) [meaning He is his twin-brother]: and هُمَا<br>\
تَوْءَمَانِ (S, * M, Mgh, Msb * K) and تَوْءَمٌ (M, K)<br>\
[They two are twin-brothers]: or تَوْءَمٌ applies<br>\
only to one of the two; (Msb;) it is a mistake<br>\
to say هُمَا تَوْءَمٌ and هُمَا زَوْجٌ: (Mgh:) [but see<br>\
زَوْجٌ:] Lth says that تَوْءَمٌ applies to two sons, or<br>\
young ones, [born] together; and that one should<br>\
not say هُمَا تَوْءَمَانِ, but هُمَا تَوْءَمٌ: this, however,<br>\
is a mistake: correctly, as ISk and Fr say, تَوْءَمٌ<br>\
applies to one, and تَوْءَمَانِ to two. (T, TA.) It<br>\
is of the measure فَوْعَلٌ, (Kh, S, IB, Msb,) in the<br>\
opinion of some, (IB,) and originally وَوْءَمٌ, (Kh,<br>\
T, S, IB,) like as تَوْلَجٌ is originally وَوْلَجٌ; (Kh,<br>\
T, S;) from الوِئَامُ, (T, IB,) “ the being mutually<br>\
near,” (T,) “ mutually agreeing,” (T, IB,) “ being<br>\
mutually conformable; ” (IB;) so that it means<br>\
one that agrees with, or matches, another, (IB.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  It is metaphorically used in relation to all<br>\
things resembling one another [so that it means<br>\
(tropical:)  One of a pair]. (M.) A poet says,<br>\
قَالَتْ لَنَا وَدَمْعُهَا تُؤَامُ<br>\
كَالدُّرِّ إِذْ أَسْلَمَهُ النِّظَامُ<br>\
عَلَى الَّذِينَ ارْتَحَلُوا السَّلَامُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [She said to us, while her tears fell in pairs,<br>\
or in close succession, like large pearls when the<br>\
string lets them drop off, Upon those who have<br>\
departed be peace]. (S.) [This citation, and what<br>\
immediately follows it in the S, mentioning the<br>\
pl. تَوْءَمُونَ, not تُؤَامُونَ, have been misunderstood<br>\
by Golius; and Freytag has followed him in this<br>\
case.] ―<br>\
-b3-  التَّوْءَمُ is also [a name of] (assumed tropical:)  A certain<br>\
Mansion [of the Moon; namely, the Sixth; more<br>\
commonly called الهَنْعَةُ;] pertaining to الجَوْزَآء<br>\
[here meaning Gemini]; (M, K;) one of two<br>\
[asterisms] called تَوْءَمَانِ: (M:) التَّوْءَمَانِ is (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
Sign of Gemini. (Kzw.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [The pl.] تَوَائِمُ also<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  Clusters, or what are clustered together,<br>\
(مَا تَشَابَكَ,) of stars, and of pearls. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And تَوْءَمَانِ, (assumed tropical:)  A pair of pearls, or large pearls,<br>\
for the ear: each of them is termed a تَوْءَمَة to<br>\
the other. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  التَّوْءَمَانِ, [in the CK<br>\
التَّوْءَمانُ,] (assumed tropical:)  A certain small herb, (AHn, M, K,)<br>\
having a fruit like cumin-seed, (AHn, M, and K<br>\
in art. وأم,) and many leaves, growing in the<br>\
plains, spreading long and wide, and having a<br>\
yellow flower. (AHn, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  التَّوْءَمُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The arrow of the kind used in the game<br>\
called المَيْسِر: (M:) or a certain arrow of those<br>\
used in that game: (K:) or the second of those<br>\
arrows; (S, M, K;) said by Lh to have two<br>\
notches, and to entitle to two portions [of the<br>\
slaughtered camel] if successful, and to subject<br>\
to the payment for two portions if unsuccessful.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And تَوْءَمَاتٌ, (assumed tropical:)  A kind of women&#39;s vehicles<br>\
[borne by camels], (T, K,) like the مَشَاجِر, (T, TA,)<br>\
erroneously said in the copies of the K to be like<br>\
the مَشَاجِب, (TA,) having no coverings, or canopies: the sing. is تَوْءَمَةٌ. (T, K.)<br>\
تَوْءَمِيَّةٌ: see تُؤَامِيَّةٌ.<br>\
مُتْئِمٌ Twinning, or bringing forth two at one<br>\
birth; (S, M, Msb, K;) applied to a mother,<br>\
(K,) or a woman, (S, M, Msb,) and to any pregnant animal; (M;) without ة. (Msb.)<br>\
مِتْآمٌ Accustomed to twin, or bring forth two at<br>\
one birth; (S, M, K;) applied to a mother, (K,)<br>\
or a woman, (S, M,) and to any pregnant animal:<br>\
(M:) pl. مَتَائِيمُ. (Har p. 613.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (Har<br>\
ubi suprà,) ثَوْبٌ مِتْآمٌ, (S, Har,) or ↓ مُتَآءَمٌ, (TA,<br>\
PS,) [both app. correct,] (assumed tropical:)  A piece of cloth woven<br>\
of threads two and two together in its warp and<br>\
its woof. (S, Har, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence, also, أَبْيَاتٌ مَتَائِيمُ<br>\
(tropical:)  Verses consisting of words in pairs whereof each<br>\
member resembles the other in writing. (Har ubi<br>\
suprà.) [See also مُتَوْءَمٌ.]<br>\
مُتَآءَمٌ: see مِتْآمٌ.<br>\
فَرَسٌ مُتَائِمٌ (assumed tropical:)  A horse fetching, or that fetches,<br>\
run after run. (S, M.)<br>\
تَجْنِيسٌ مُتَوْءَمٌ (assumed tropical:)  The using two words resembling<br>\
each other in writing but not in expression; as<br>\
in the saying, غَرَّكَ عِزُّكَ فَصَارَ قُصَارُ ذٰلِكَ ذُلَّكَ فَاخْشَ<br>\
فَاحِشَ فِعْلِكَ فَعَلَّكَ تُهْدَا بِهٰذَا [Thy might, or<br>\
elevated rank, hath deceived thee, and the end of<br>\
that has become thine ignominy: fear then thine<br>\
exorbitant deed, and may-be thou wilt be made to<br>\
follow a right course by this]. (Har p. 269.)<br>\
