تَعَبَ, (A, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَعَبٌ, (S, Msb,) He [a man and a beast] was, or<br>\
became, fatigued, tired, wearied [by labour or<br>\
journeying &amp;c.], or jaded; (S, A, Msb;) contr.<br>\
of اِسْتَرَاحَ. (K.) [تَعَبٌ, which, used as a simple<br>\
subst., may be rendered Fatigue, tiredness, weariness, or the state of being jaded, is here said in<br>\
the TA to be contr. of رَاحَةٌ; and to signify شِدَّةُ<br>\
العَنَآءِ, which may be rendered much fatigue &amp;c.;<br>\
but accord. to an explanation of the verb of عَنَآءٌ<br>\
in the S and TA in art. عنى, this word and تَعَبٌ<br>\
signify the same. See also مَتْعَبٌ.]<br>\

اتعب He fatigued, tired, wearied, or jaded,<br>\
another; (S, Msb, K;) and himself, in a work<br>\
that he imposed upon himself, or in which he<br>\
laboured; and his travelling-camels, by urging<br>\
them quickly, or by hard journeying. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
(tropical:)  He broke a bone again after it had been set, or<br>\
consolidated: or he caused a bone to have a defect<br>\
in it, after it had been set, so that there remained<br>\
in it a constant swelling, or resulted a lameness:<br>\
اتعب العَظْمَ signifying أَعْنَتَهُ بَعْدَ الجَبْرِ: (so in the<br>\
CK:) or أَعْتَبَهُ بعد الجبر. (So in MS. copies of<br>\
the K and in the TA. [In the latter, in art.<br>\
عتب, this reading is confirmed; but a remark<br>\
below, voce مُتْعَبٌ, rather favours the former<br>\
reading, that of the CK.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  He filled a vessel;<br>\
(A, K;) as, for instance, a drinking-cup, or bowl.<br>\
(A.)<br>\
-A2-  اتعب القَوْمُ The people&#39;s cattle became<br>\
fatigued, tired, wearied, or jaded. (K.)<br>\
تَعِبٌ Fatigued, tired, wearied, or jaded; as<br>\
also ↓ مُتْعَبٌ; (S, Msb, K;) but not مَتْعُوبٌ. (S,<br>\
K.) [↓ تَعْبَان, for تَعْبَانٌ, fem. with ة, is used<br>\
in this sense in the present day.]<br>\
تَعْبَان: see what next precedes.<br>\
مَتْعَبٌ A place of تَعَب [or fatigue, &amp;c.]: ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
and tropically, syn. with تَعَبٌ: pl. مَتَاعِبُ. (Har<br>\
p. 431.)<br>\
مُتْعَبٌ: see تَعِبٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  A camel that has<br>\
had a bone of one of his fore legs or hind legs<br>\
broken and set, and has been fatigued beyond his<br>\
power of endurance before the bone has consolidated, so that the fracture has become complete:<br>\
whence the phrase عَظْمٌ مُتْعَبٌ [app. meaning (tropical:)  a<br>\
bone broken again after its having been set, or<br>\
consolidated: see 4]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A vessel, as, for<br>\
instance, a drinking-cup, or bowl, (tropical:)  filled. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Water (tropical:)  squeezed forth, or expressed, from the<br>\
earth, to be drunk. (A, TA.)<br>\
مَتْعَبَةٌ [A cause of fatigue or weariness: a word<br>\
of the same class as مَجْبَنَةٌ and مَبْخَلَةٌ: loosely<br>\
explained in Har p. 475 as meaning a place of<br>\
fatigue]. One says, اِسْتِخْرَاجُ المُعَمَّى مَتْعَبَةٌ<br>\
لِلْخَوَاطِرِ [The eliciting of the meaning of that<br>\
which is made enigmatical is a cause of fatigue<br>\
to minds]. (A.)<br>\
