تَاسَ, [aor. يَتِيسُ,] He (a kid) became a تَيْس.<br>\
(M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also, app., (tropical:)  He became like a hegoat in stupidity: for what immediately follows<br>\
appears to be the fem. of the imp. of this verb.]<br>\
↓ تِيسِى is a word used in declaring a thing to be<br>\
vain, and false: (M, K:) or it is an execration;<br>\
[for لُعْبَةٌ, an evident mistake, which I find in<br>\
copies of the K, and in the TA, I read لَعْنَةٌ;] and<br>\
a reproach: (K:) the vulgar say تِيزِى, changing<br>\
the س into ز. (TA.) One says to a she-hyena,<br>\
تِيسِى جَعَارِ, (A, * K,) meaning (tropical:)  Be thou like the<br>\
he-goat (تَيْس) in stupidity, O she-hyena: and<br>\
these words are a proverb applied to a stupid<br>\
man. (A, TA.) The same words were directed,<br>\
by Aboo-Eiyoob, as is related in a trad., to be<br>\
said to a غُول, (M, TA,) as though one said to her,<br>\
Thou liest, or hast lied, O girl. (TA,) And one<br>\
says to a man, تِيسِى, and اِحْمَقِى, [as though he<br>\
were a she-hyena, or a woman,] when he speaks<br>\
foolishly, or stupidly, or says what is not like<br>\
anything. (AZ, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
تايس قِرْنَهُ, (A,) inf. n. مُتَايَسَةٌ and تِيَاسٌ, (A,<br>\
K,) (tropical:)  He strove, struggled, contended, or conflicted,<br>\
with his adversary; syn. مَارَسَهُ: (A:) [he strove<br>\
with his adversary to repel him, like as a he-goat<br>\
strives with another:] the inf. n. signifies the same<br>\
as مُمَارَسَةٌ, and مُكَابَسَةٌ, and مُدَافَعَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
6<br>\
تتايس المَآءُ (tropical:)  The waves of the water conflicted, or dashed together. (A, TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
اِسْتَتْيَسَتِ العَنْزُ (tropical:)  The she-goat became like<br>\
the تَيْس [or he-goat]: (M, [but in a copy of that<br>\
work, for العَنْزُ I find الشَّاةُ,] A, K:) like اِسْتَنْوَقَ<br>\
الجَمَلُ: (S:) a prov. applied to a vile man who<br>\
becomes mighty, (A,) or who magnifies himself:<br>\
(K:) one should not say استتاست. (Th, M, TA.)<br>\
تَيْسٌ A he-goat; the male of the مَعْز: (S,* M,<br>\
A, K:) and the male of the mountain-goat: (A,<br>\
K) and of the gazelle: (S, M, A, K:) the female<br>\
of the last [as well as of the first and second] is<br>\
called عَنْزٌ: (S, M:) or that has completed a year:<br>\
(A, K:) or a yearling he-goat: before the year<br>\
it is called جَدْىBٌ: (AZ, * Msb, TA:) pl. (of pauc.,<br>\
M) أَتْيَاسٌ (S, M, K) and أَتْيُسٌ, (M, TA,) and (of<br>\
mult., M) تُيُوسٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and تِيَسَةٌ and<br>\
↓ مَتْيُوسَآءُ [like مَشْيُوخَآءُ, q. v.]: (K:) the last<br>\
[which is properly a quasi-pl. n.] signifies the<br>\
same as تُيُوسٌ, (S,) or a herd of تُيُوس. (M.) You<br>\
say of the نَكَّاح, [i. e. of him who marries often,<br>\
or the like,] بَنِى فُلَانٍ ↓ هُوَ مِنْ مُتْيُوسَآءِ (tropical:)  [lit. He<br>\
is of the he-goats of the sons of such a one]. (A,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
تَيَسٌ The quality, in a she-goat, of having horns<br>\
like those of the mountain-goat, (K, TA,) in<br>\
length. (TA.)<br>\
تِيسِى: see 1.<br>\
عَنْزٌ تَيْسَآءٌ A she-goat having long horns, (M,<br>\
A,) like the  تَيْس: (A:) or having horns like<br>\
those of the mountain-goat, (K, TA,) in length.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
فِيهِ تَيْسِيَّةٌ [In him is goatishness]: some say<br>\
↓ تَيْسُوسِيَّةٌ, [in the TA تُيُوسِيَّةٌ, but the former, which<br>\
is found in the L as well as in the S and K, seems,<br>\
from what here follows, to be the right,] (S, L,<br>\
K,) and [in like manner, for كَيْفِيَّةٌ they say]<br>\
كَيْفُوفِيَّةٌ, but [ J says] I know not what is the<br>\
truth thereof: (S:) the former word is preferable.<br>\
(O, TA.)<br>\
تَيْسُوسِيَّةٌ: see تَيْسِيَّةٌ.<br>\
تَيَّاسٌ A possessor of  تُيُوس [or he-goats]: (M:)<br>\
or one who holds the تَيْس. (S, K: explained in<br>\
the former by الَّذِى يُمْسِكُ التَّيْسَ: and in like<br>\
manner in the latter, by مُمْسِكُهُ.)<br>\
مَتْيُوسَآءُ: see تَيْسٌ, in two places.<br>\
