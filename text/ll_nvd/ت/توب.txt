تَابَ, (T, A,) or تاب إِلَى اللّٰهِ, (S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
يَتُوبُ, (Msb,) inf. n. تَوْبَةٌ and تَوْبٌ, (T, S, M, Msb,<br>\
K,) both of these signifying the same, (T, S, M,<br>\
Msb,) the ة in the former being added to denote<br>\
the fem. gender, or, as some say, the former is a<br>\
n. un. like ضَرْبَةٌ, (Msb,) or, as Akh says, تَوْبٌ is<br>\
pl. [or a quasi-pl. n.] of تَوْبَةٌ, like as عَوْمٌ is of<br>\
عَوْمَةٌ, (S,) or like as لَوْزٌ is of لَوْزَةٌ, and this is the<br>\
opinion of Mbr, (M,) and تَابَةٌ, (M, K,) which is<br>\
for تَوْبَةٌ, (M,) and مَتَابٌ (S, M, A, K) and تَتْوِبَةٌ,<br>\
(S, * M, * K,) of the measure تَفْعِلَةٌ, (S, M,) an<br>\
anomalous form, (TA,) syn. with تَوْبَةٌ, mentioned<br>\
in the Book of Sb; (S;) [He repented; or repented toward God; as will be shown by what<br>\
follows:] originally, he returned unto God, (T,<br>\
TA,) مِنْ كَذَا and عَنْ كَذَا [from such a thing]:<br>\
(TA:) or he returned, [or returned unto God,]<br>\
(S, M, A, K,) from sin, (S,) or from his sin, (A,)<br>\
or from disobedience (M, K) to obedience: (M:)<br>\
or تَابَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ signifies he desisted from his sin:<br>\
(Msb:) تَوْبَةٌ signifies the repenting of sin; i. e.<br>\
the grieving for it, or regretting it, with the confession of having no excuse for the commission<br>\
thereof. (Kull.) It is said in a trad., النَّدَمُ تَوْبَةٌ<br>\
[Repentance is] a returning from sin. (S.) The<br>\
time of El-Islám is termed زَمَنُ التَّوْبَةِ as being<br>\
The time of returning from [or repenting of] the<br>\
belief in a plurality of gods. (A.) A poet says,<br>\
تُبْتُ إِلَيْكَ فَتَقَبَّلْ تَابَتِى<br>\
وَصُمْتُ رَبِّى فَتَفَبَّلْ صَامَتِى<br>\
[I have repented toward Thee, and accept Thou<br>\
my repentance; and I have fasted, O my Lord,<br>\
and accept Thou my fast]; meaning تَوْبَتِى and<br>\
صَوْمَتِى. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تَابَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ God returned to<br>\
forgiveness towards him; became again forgiving<br>\
to him: (T:) or disposed, or adapted, him to<br>\
repentance, or returning from sin or disobedience:<br>\
(S, K:) or reverted from severity to mildness<br>\
towards him: or returned to him with his favour,<br>\
or grace, and his acceptance, or approbation;<br>\
became again propitious to him: (A, K:) all<br>\
these meanings are correct: (TA:) or God forgave him, and saved him from acts of disobedience:<br>\
(Msb:) or accepted his repentance: (Jel in ii. 35<br>\
&amp;c.:) or returned towards him with mercy, and<br>\
acceptance of repentance. (Bd ibid.)<br>\
10<br>\
استتابهُ He proposed to him that he should<br>\
return [to obedience unto God], (T, A,) and<br>\
repent of that which he had committed: (T:) he<br>\
asked him to return from sin, or disobedience:<br>\
(S, K:) or he asked him to desist from his sin.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
تَابُوتٌ, originally تَوَبُوتٌ, the ت not being the<br>\
characteristic of the fem. gender, (Z, MF, TA,) of<br>\
the measure فَعَلُوتٌ, and meaning A chest, or box,<br>\
from التَّوْبُ, because what is taken out from it<br>\
continually returns to it: (AAF, IJ, Z, MF, TA:)<br>\
or originally تَابُوَةٌ; (S, K; [in the CK تَأْبُوَةٌ;])<br>\
the و being made quiescent, and the ة changed<br>\
into ت: (S, K:) [in Chald. ?: in Hebr.<br>\
?:] it signifies also the ribs, with what they<br>\
contain, as the heart and the liver &amp;c.; as being<br>\
likened to a chest, or box; (IAth, TA in art.<br>\
تبت;) the chest, breast, or bosom: (A in that<br>\
art.:) or [primarily] the ribs, with what they<br>\
contain, as the heart &amp;c.: and [hence] applied to<br>\
a chest, or box: (Towsheeh, MF, TA:) also<br>\
written تَبُوتٌ. (K in art. تبت.) [It is generally<br>\
applied in the present day to a bier: a coffin:<br>\
and an oblong case that is placed over a grave:<br>\
the pl. is تَوَابِيتُ.] El-Kásim Ibn-Maan says that<br>\
it is the only word in the Kur-án in respect of<br>\
which the dialects of Kureysh and the Ansár<br>\
differ; the former pronouncing it تَابُوتٌ; (S;)<br>\
and the latter, تَابُوهٌ. (S, K.) But IB denies that<br>\
its last letter is originally ة, the fem. termination;<br>\
asserting the final ت to be a radical letter, the<br>\
measure of the word to be فَاعُولٌ, and its proper<br>\
place in art. تبت: he says that the final ت is<br>\
changed in a case of pause, but not generally, into<br>\
ه, as is that of الفُرَات [the Euphrates], in which<br>\
the ت is not the fem. termination. (L, TA.) You<br>\
say, مَا أَوْدَعْتُ تَابُوتِى شَيْئًا فَقَدْتُهُ, meaning I have<br>\
not deposited in my bosom anything of knowledge,<br>\
or science, that I have lost. (A in art. تبت.)<br>\
تَوَّابٌ, applied to a man, [One who repents much<br>\
or often;] returning from disobedience to obedience<br>\
[to God] (M, K, TA) much or often. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And applied to God, One who returns [much or<br>\
often] to forgiveness towards his servant who<br>\
returns unto Him: (T:) or who [often] disposes,<br>\
or adapts, to repentance, or returning from sin or<br>\
disobedience; or reverts from severity to mildness;<br>\
or returns with his favour or grace, &amp;c.: (A, K:<br>\
[see 1, last sentence:]) or who forgives much, and<br>\
save from acts of disobedience. (Msb.)<br>\
تَائِبٌ [Repenting of sin: (see 1:) originally,]<br>\
returning from disobedience (M, K) to obedience<br>\
to God. (M.)<br>\
