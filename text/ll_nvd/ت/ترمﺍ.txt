تُرْمُسٌ [vulgarly pronounced in the present day<br>\
تِرْمِس; from the Greek θέρμο�, or Coptic θαρο�;<br>\
Lupines; or the lupine;] a certain grain, well<br>\
known, of the description termed قَطَانِىّ; (Msb;)<br>\
the produce of a tree [or plant] which has<br>\
a grain ribbed and notched: (Lth, M, * K:)<br>\
or i. q. بَاقِلَّى مِصْرِىٌّ: (the Minháj and K:) [but<br>\
if this be the same as the بَاقِلَّى قِبْطِىّ, it is a<br>\
mistake, accord. to Ibn-Beytár, to identify it with<br>\
the ترمس:] AHn says that it is the جِرْجِير مِصْرِىّ,<br>\
and is of the description termed قَطَانِىّ; and under<br>\
the head of the letter ج, he says that the جِرْجِير<br>\
is the بَاقِلِّى: accord. to the Minháj, it is a grain<br>\
of an expanded shape, of bitter taste, hollowed in<br>\
the middle; and the wild kind is smaller than<br>\
the other, and stronger: and the ترمس approaches<br>\
more to medicine than to food: the best is the<br>\
white, large, and heavy: (TA:) some say that<br>\
the ت is augmentative, and that the word is from<br>\
رَمَسَ, signifying “ he concealed ” a thing: (MF,<br>\
TA:) the n. un. is with ة (Msb.)<br>\
