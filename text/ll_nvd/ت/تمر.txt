تَمْرٌ, a coll. gen. n.; (S, A;) masc. in one dial.<br>\
and fem. in another [like other nouns of the same<br>\
class]; (Msb;) Dates, or the fruit of the palmtree: (M:) or dried dates, like زَبِيبٌ as applied<br>\
to grapes, by general consent of the lexicologists:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) the dates are left upon the palmtree, after they have become ripe, until they are<br>\
dry, or nearly so, when they are cut, and left in<br>\
the sun to dry thoroughly; and sometimes, as<br>\
AHát says, the fruit of the palm-tree is cut when<br>\
full-grown but unripe, to lighten the tree, or from<br>\
fear of theft, and left until it becomes تَمْر: (Msb:)<br>\
the n. un. is with ة: and the pl. of تَمْرٌ is تُمُورٌ<br>\
and تُمْرَانٌ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) meaning sorts or<br>\
varieties [of تَمْر]; for a coll. gen. n. has not a pl.<br>\
in the proper sense: (S:) and in like manner the<br>\
dual تَمْرَانِ means two sorts [of تَمْر]: (Sb cited<br>\
in the M in art. بسر:) the pl. of تَمْرَةٌ is تَمَرَاتٌ.<br>\
(S, K.) [See also بُسْرٌ.] Hence the prov., أَعْطِ<br>\
أَخَاكَ تَمْرَةً فَإِنْ أَبَى فَجَمْرَةً [Give thou thy brother<br>\
a dried date; and if he refuse it, a live coal].<br>\
(A, TA.) And التَّمْرُ بِالسَّوِيقِ [Dried dates with<br>\
meal of parched barley or wheat] is another prov.,<br>\
used in allusion to requital. (Lh.) And one<br>\
says, وَجَدَ عِنْدَهُ تَمْرَةَ الغُرَابِ, meaning (tropical:)  He found<br>\
with him, or at his abode, what he approved.<br>\
(A.) And نَفْسُهُ تَمْرَةٌ بِكَذَا (tropical:)  His mind is pleased,<br>\
or agreeably affected, with, or by, such a thing;<br>\
or consents to such a thing. (A, K. * [Accord. to<br>\
the TA, it is here like فَرِحَةٌ; but this seems to be<br>\
true as to the meaning; not as to the form of the<br>\
word. See also art. ثمر, voce ثَمِرٌ.]) And دَعْنِى<br>\
إِنَّ نَفْسِى غَيْرُ تَمْرَةٍ (tropical:)  [Leave thou me, or let me<br>\
alone: verily my mind is not pleased, or happy].<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تَمْرٌ هِنْدِىٌّ [The fruit of the tamarindtree; thus called in the present day;] i. q. حُمَرٌ<br>\

تَمْرِىٌّ One who loves تَمْر [or dried dates]. (S,<br>\
A, K.)<br>\
تَمَّارٌ A seller of تَمْر [or dried dates]. (S, A, K.)<br>\
تَامِرٌ Possessing تَمْر [or dried dates]; (S, M, A,<br>\
Msb;) like لَابِنٌ “ possessing milk: ” (S, Msb:)<br>\
or تَامِرٌ, (Lh, M, K,) or ↓ مُتْمِرٌ, (S, A,) signifies<br>\
possessing many, or a large quantity of, تَمْر: (Lh,<br>\
S, M, A, K:) the former of these two words is<br>\
held by ISd to be a possessive epithet: (TA:)<br>\
and sometimes it may signify feeding people with,<br>\
or giving them to eat, تَمْر. (S, TA.)<br>\
