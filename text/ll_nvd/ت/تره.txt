paragraph is the primary signification: (TA:)<br>\

vain, saying or action or affair; (As, JK, S K;)<br>\
as also ↓ تُرَّهٌ: (S, K:) pl. of the former, تُرَّهَاتٌ<br>\

latter, تَرَارِيَهُ: (S, K: *) or the primary signification of تُرَّهَاتٌ is قِفَارٌ: [see 1:] and it is metaphorically applied to (tropical:)  false, or vain, sayings or<br>\

it is followed by a syn., to give greater force to<br>\
the signification:] one says التُرَّهَاتُ البَسَابِسُ and<br>\
التُرَّهَاتُ الصَّحَاصِحُ: and sometimes the former<br>\
word is used as a prefixed noun governing the<br>\
gen. case [so that one says تُرَّهَاتُ البَسَابِسُ and<br>\
ترّهاتُ الصَّحَاصِحِ: الصَّحْصَحُ is mentioned in the<br>\
K, in this art., as a syn. of التُّرَّهَةُ]. (S.) ―<br>\
