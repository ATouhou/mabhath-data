تَهِمَ, (JK, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
تَهَمَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَهَمٌ, (Msb,) or تَهَامَةٌ, (JK,) It (flesh-meat, JK,<br>\
Msb, K, and milk, Msb, and oil, K) became altered<br>\
for the worse, and stank: (JK, * Msb, K: *) it<br>\
(flesh-meat, TK) had a foul odour; it stank. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  It (the heat) was, or became, vehement, or<br>\
intense, with stillness of the wind. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also,<br>\
inf. n. تَهَمٌ, He (a camel) was penetrated by the<br>\
heat: (JK:) or was smitten by the hot wind, and<br>\
in consequence became lean, or emaciated. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And, (JK, K,) inf. n. تَهَمٌ, (TA,) He (a camel)<br>\
ate much of the pasture (اِسْتَكْثَرَ مِنَ المَرْعَى), and<br>\
it was not wholesome: (JK:) or disapproved the<br>\
pasture (اِسْتَنْكَرَ المَرْعَى), and did not find it wholesome, (K, TA,) and his condition became bad.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And, said of a man, His impotence, or<br>\
inability, became apparent, and he became confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his right<br>\
course. (K.)<br>\

تَاْهَمَ see 4.<br>\

اتهم He (a man, S) went, (S,) or came, (K,)<br>\
to Tihámeh: (S, K:) Er-Riyáshee says, I have<br>\
heard the Arabs of the desert say thus of him<br>\
who has descended from the mountain-roads of<br>\
Dhát &#39;Irk: (TA:) or he alighted, or abode,<br>\
therein: (K:) as also ↓ تَاهَمَ, (JK, K, TA, [in<br>\
the CK, erroneously, تَاهَّمَ,]) in the latter sense,<br>\
(JK,) and ↓ تتهّم; (K;) or these mean he came<br>\
to Tihámeh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Accord. to Golius, on<br>\
the authority of a gloss. in the KL, it signifies also,<br>\
He went into a region of hot air: and this, if<br>\
correct, may be the primary meaning.]<br>\
-A2-  اتهم<br>\
البَلَدَ He found the country, or town, to be insalubrious, (K, TA,) and to have a bad, or foul,<br>\
odour. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  اتهم, inf. n. إِتْهَامٌ; in measure<br>\
like أَكْرَمَ, inf. n. إِكْرَامٌ; (Msb;) [originally<br>\
اوهم; or] formed from تُهَمَةٌ, in consequence of<br>\
imagining the ت in this word to be radical;<br>\
(MF in art. وهم;) [like as is said of أَتْخَمَ;] He<br>\
did a thing that made him an object of suspicion:<br>\
(JK and Msb and TA in the present art.:) or<br>\
he was an object of suspicion: (K in art. وهم:<br>\
[in the CK and TK, erroneously, اتّهم:]) or there<br>\
was in him that which induced suspicion: you<br>\
say of a man, when you suspect him, أَتْهَمْتَ,<br>\
inf. n. إِتْهَامٌ; like أَدْوَأْتَ, inf. n. إِدْوَآءٌ. (S in art.<br>\
وهم.)<br>\
-A4-  اتهمهُ He suspected him; thought evil<br>\
of him; as also ↓ اِتَّهَمَهُ [which is the more<br>\
common]. (Msb in this art.) You say, اتهمهُ بِكَذَا,<br>\
(K, and so in some copies of the S, both in art.<br>\
وهم,) inf. n. إِتْهَامٌ; (K in that art.;) or بِهِ ↓ اِتَّهَمَهُ;<br>\
(Msb and K, and so in some copies of the S, all<br>\
in that art.;) and أَوْهَمَهُ; (K in that art.;) He<br>\
suspected him of such a thing; imputed it to<br>\
him; (Msb and K * and TA, all in that art.;)<br>\
[and he accused him of such a thing;] i. e.,<br>\
a thing attributed to him. (TA.) And ↓ اِتَّهَمْتُهُ<br>\
فِى قَوْلِهِ [I suspected him in respect of his saying;]<br>\
I doubted of the correctness, or truth, of his<br>\
saying. (Msb in art. وهم.)<br>\

تَهَمٌ [in the CK, erroneously, تَهْم] Land descending (أَرْضٌ مُتَصَوِّبَةٌ [in the CK, here and afterwards,<br>\
erroneously, مُتَصَوِّيَة]) to the sea; as also ↓ تَهَمَةٌ;<br>\
(K, TA;) mentioned by IKt, from Ez-Ziyádee,<br>\
from As: (TA:) these two words seem to be<br>\
[originally] inf. ns. from تِهَامَةُ: (K:) [and accord.<br>\
to F,] ↓ التَّهْمَةُ is a dial. var. of ↓ تِهَامَةُ: (K:)<br>\
[but J says,] ↓ التَّهَمَةُ is used in the place of<br>\
↓ تِهَامَةُ, as though it were [originally] the inf. n. un.,<br>\
accord. to the saying of As that التَّهَمُ, with fet-h<br>\
to the medial radical, is an inf. n. from ↓ تِهَامَةُ:<br>\
(S:) for the ↓ تَهَائِم [pl. of تِهَامَةُ, and thus meaning the parts of Tihámeh, or, accord. to the JK,<br>\
meaning lands descending to the sea,] do descend<br>\
to the sea: (K, TA:) so says As: (TA:) and<br>\
[hence] the rájiz says, (namely, Sheytán Ibn-Mudlij, TA,)<br>\
نَظَرْتُ وَالعَيْنُ مُبِينَةُ التَّهَمْ<br>\
[I looked, the eye distinguishing Et-Taham], (S,<br>\
and Ham p. 659,) meaning Et-Tihámeh. (Ham<br>\
ibid.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [As inf. n. of تَهِمَ, q. v.,] التَّهَمُ also signifies Vehemence of heat, and [or with] stillness<br>\
of the wind. (K.) And hence Tihámeh is said<br>\
to be thus called. (TA.)<br>\
تَهِمٌ, applied to flesh-me., Altered for the<br>\
worse; (JK;) having a foul odour; stinking.<br>\
(JK, * K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَرْضٌ تَهِمَةٌ A land vehemently, or<br>\
intensely, hot. (Er-Riyáshee, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Sleeping;<br>\
(JK;) i. q. تَهِنٌ. (TA in art. لعث.)<br>\
التَّهْمَةُ: see تَهَمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  It, (K,) or ↓ التَّهَمَةُ, (JK,)<br>\
signifies also البَلْدَةُ [app. as meaning Mekkeh,<br>\
like ↓ تِهَامَةُ; as though the city of cities]: (JK,<br>\
K:) so in the phrase ↓ أَهْلُ التَّهَمَةِ [which may<br>\
mean The people of Mekkeh; and also, of Tihá-<br>\
meh, in the more extended sense of the latter<br>\
appellation]. (JK.)<br>\
تُهْمَةٌ: see تُهَمَةٌ.<br>\
فِيهِ تَهَمَةٌ In it is a foul odour; a stink. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also تَهَمٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  التَّهَمَةُ: see تَهَمٌ, and التَّهْمَةُ;<br>\
the latter in two places.<br>\
تُهَمَةٌ, (S, M, K, &amp;c., in art. وهم, and Msb in<br>\
that art. and in the present also,) of which ↓ تُهْمَةٌ<br>\
is a dial. var. mentioned by El-Fárábee (Msb,<br>\
and TA in art. وهم) and by several other authors,<br>\
or, accord. to Ibn-Kemál, the latter is an inf. n.<br>\
and the former is a simple subst., but Esh-Shiháb<br>\
doubts of this; (TA;) originally وَهَمَةٌ, (S, ISd,<br>\
Msb, &amp;c.,) like as تُخَمَةٌ is originally وُخَمَةٌ;<br>\
(ISd, TA;) a subst. from اِتَّهَمَهُ; (S, Msb, both<br>\
in art. وهم;) Doubt: and [more commonly]<br>\
suspicion, or evil opinion; or doubt combined<br>\
with suspicion or evil opinion: syn. شَكٌّ: and رِيبَةٌ:<br>\
(Msb in the present art.:) or i. q. ظَنٌّ [which is<br>\
a preponderating wavering between the two extremes of indecisive belief; and often means suspicion]: (ISd and TA in art. وهم:) or a thing<br>\
for which one is suspected: (K in that art.:<br>\
[and this is often meant by رِيبَةٌ, one of the syns.<br>\
mentioned above:]) the pl. of تُهْمَةٌ is تُهَمٌ, mentioned by Sb, who argues that it is a pl. [and not<br>\
a coll. gen. n.] from their saying هِىَ التُّهَمُ [They<br>\
are suspicions, &amp;c.], and not saying هُوَ التُّهَمُ like<br>\
as they say هُوَ الرُّطَبُ. (TA in art. وهم.)<br>\
تَهَامٍ: see تِهَامِىٌّ.<br>\
تَهِيمٌ Suspected; thought evil of; (JK in this<br>\
art., and Msb in this and in art. وهم;) [as also<br>\
↓ مُتَّهَمٌ and ↓ مُتْهَمٌ:] or being an object of suspicion;<br>\
as also ↓ مُتْهِمٌ. (K in art. وهم. [In the CK, the<br>\
latter is erroneously written مُتَّهِمٌ.])<br>\
تِهَامَةُ a name of Mekkeh: (JK, K:) and [more<br>\
commonly] a certain land, (Msb, K,) well known,<br>\
(K,) commencing from Dhát &#39;Irk, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
towards Nejd, (Msb,) and extending to Mekkeh<br>\
and beyond it to the distance of two day&#39;s journeys<br>\
(Msb, TA) and more, then uniting with the<br>\
Ghowr, and extending to the sea: some say that<br>\
it adjoins the land of El-Yemen; and that Mekkeh<br>\
is of تِهَامَةُ اليَمَنِ: (Msb:) [F says that] J has<br>\
erred in terming it a بَلَد: (K:) [but by بلد, J<br>\
may mean both a city and a country or province:]<br>\
some say that its name is from تَهِمَ in the first of<br>\
the senses assigned to this verb above, because it<br>\
is low in relation to Nejd, so that its odour is<br>\
bad; and some, that it is from the same verb in<br>\
the sense explained in the second sentence, because<br>\
of its vehement heat: (Msb:) [it seems to have<br>\
تَهَائِمُ for a pl.:] see تَهَمٌ, in four places; and<br>\
التَّهْمَةُ.<br>\
تِهَامِىٌّ Of, or belonging to, Tihámeh; as also<br>\
↓ تَهَامٍ, (T, S, M, Msb, K, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
تَهامٌ,]) with fet-h, (Msb, K,) irregularly formed;<br>\
(M, Msb;) fem. تَهَامِيَةٌ; like رَبَاعٍ and رَبَاعِيَةٌ: (T,<br>\
Msb:) when it is pronounced with fet-h to the<br>\
ت, it is without teshdeed [to the ى when you say<br>\
التَّهَامِى and تَهَامِيَةٌ]; as in the instances of رَجُلٌ<br>\
يَمَانٍ and شَآمٍ, except that the ا in تَهَامٍ is of the<br>\
original word, and that in يَمَانٍ and شَآمٍ is a<br>\
substitute for the two ى of the [regular] rel. n.,<br>\
(S,) or rather, for one of those two ى: (Aboo-Zekereeyà, TA:) and you say قَوْمٌ تَهَامُونَ [A<br>\
people, or company of men, of Tihámeh], like<br>\
يَمَانُونَ: (S, K:) and accord. to Sb, some say<br>\
تَهَامِىٌّ and يَمَانِىٌّ and شَآمِىٌّ, with fet-h, and with<br>\
teshdeed [to the ى]. (S.)<br>\
مُتْهَمٌ: see تَهِيمٌ.<br>\
مُتْهِمٌ [Going, or coming, to Tihámeh: or alighting, or abiding, therein: and] alighting, or abiding, in Mekkeh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَادٍ مُتْهِمٌ A valley of<br>\
which the water pours to Tihámeh. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also تَهِيمٌ.<br>\
مِتْهَامٌ Often coming to Tihámeh: (S K:) pl.<br>\
مَتَاهِيمُ (S, TA) and مَتَاهِمُ, (TA,) applied to men<br>\
(S, TA) and to camels. (TA.)<br>\
مُتَّهَمٌ: see تَهِيمٌ.<br>\
