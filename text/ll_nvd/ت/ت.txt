ت<br>\
The third letter of the alphabet: called تَآءٌ and تَا<br>\
[respecting which latter see the letter ب]: the<br>\
pl. [of the former is تَآءَاتٌ; and of the latter,]<br>\
أَتْوَآءُ. (TA in باب الالف الليِنّة.) It is one of the<br>\
letters termed مَهْمُوسَة [or non-vocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only, without the voice],<br>\
and of those termed نِطَعِيَّة [and نِطْعِيَّة and نَطَعِيَّة<br>\
and نَطْعِيَّة pronounced by pressing the tip of the<br>\
tongue against the upper gums and suddenly withdrawing it with an emission of the breath]: these<br>\
latter are ط and د and ت, three letters that are<br>\
among those which are changed into other letters.<br>\
(TA at the commencement of باب التآء.)<br>\
-A2-  It is<br>\
one of the augmentative letters: (S:) and is<br>\
movent when added at the beginning of a noun,<br>\
and at the end of a noun, [and at the beginning<br>\
of a verb,] and at the end of a verb, and is also<br>\
quiescent at the end of a verb. (Mughnee, K.)<br>\
-A3-  Added at the beginning of a noun, it is a preposition, or particle governing the gen. case, significant of swearing, (S, * Mughnee, K,) and<br>\
denoting wonder; (Mughnee, K;) and [accord.<br>\
to general usage] it is peculiarly prefixed to the<br>\
name اللّٰه; (S, Mughnee, K;) as in تَاللّٰهِ لَقَدْ كَانَ<br>\
كَذَا [By God, verily it was thus, or verily such<br>\
a thing was]; (S;) and تَاللّٰهِ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ كَذَا [By<br>\
God, I will assuredly do such a thing]: (TA:)<br>\
but sometimes they said, تَرَبِّى [By my Lord],<br>\
and تَرَبِّ الكَعْبَةِ [By the Lord of the Kaabeh],<br>\
and تَالرَّحْمَانِ [By the Compassionate], (Mughnee, K,) as is related on the authority of Akh;<br>\
deviating from common usage. (TA.) Thus used,<br>\
it is a substitute for و, (S, Mughnee,) as it is also<br>\
in تَتْرَى and تُرَاثٌ and تُجَاهَ and تُخَمَةٌ [&amp;c.];<br>\
(S;) and the و is a substitute for ب; (S, Mughnee;) but the ت has the additional meaning of<br>\
denoting wonder: so says Z. (Mughnee.)<br>\
-A4-<br>\
Added at the end of a noun, it is a particle of<br>\
allocution: (Mughnee, K:) it is thus added in<br>\
أَنْتَ [Thou], (S, Mughnee, K,) addressed to a<br>\
male, (TA,) and أَنْتِ [Thou], (Mughnee, K,)<br>\
addressed to a female; (TA;) uniting with the<br>\
noun, as though the two became one; not being<br>\
an affixed noun governed in the gen. case. (S.<br>\
[See أَنْ.])<br>\
-A5-  It is added in [the beginning<br>\
of] the second person of the future, (S,) [i. e.,]<br>\
in the beginning of the aor., (TA,) [as a particle<br>\
of allocution,] as in أَنْتَ تَفْعَلُ [Thou dost, or wilt<br>\
do]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also added, as a sign of<br>\
the fem. gender, in the beginning of the future,<br>\
[or aor.,] as in هِىَ تَفْعَلُ [She does, or will do]. (S,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is also added in the beginning of the<br>\
third person [fem.] of the [aor. used as an] imperative, [as a sign of the fem. gender,] as in لِتَقُمْ هِنْدُ<br>\
[Let Hind stand]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And sometimes it<br>\
is added in the beginning of the second person<br>\
of the [aor. used as an] imperative, [as a particle<br>\
of allocution,] as in the phrase in the Kur [x. 59,<br>\
accord. to one reading], فَبِذٰلِكَ فَلْتَفْرَحُوا [Therefore therein rejoice ye]: and in the saying of<br>\
the rájiz,<br>\
تِئْذَنْ فَإِنِّى حَمْؤُهَا وَجَارُهَا  قُلْتُ لِبَوَّابٍ لَدَيْهِ دَارُهَا<br>\
[explained in art.اذن]: and [thus] it is added in<br>\
the beginning of [the second person of] the [aor.<br>\
used as an] imperative of a verb of which the<br>\
agent is not named, as in لِتُزْهَ يَا رَجُلُ [Be thou<br>\
proud, vain, boastful, or self-conceited, O man],<br>\
from زُهِىَ: but Akh says that the adding of the<br>\
ل in the beginning of the second person of the<br>\
[aor. used as an] imperative [except in the case<br>\
of a pass. verb or a verb of which the agent is<br>\
not named] is a bad idiom, because the ل is not<br>\
needed. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A6-  The movent ت added at<br>\
the end of a verb is a pronoun, as in قُمْتُ [I<br>\
stood], (Mughnee, K,) and قُمْتَ [Thou stoodest,<br>\
addressed to a male], and قُمْتِ [Thou stoodest,<br>\
addressed to a female]: (Mughnee:) thus added<br>\
in the first and second persons of the pret., it is a<br>\
pronoun denoting the agent. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The quiescent ت added at the end of a verb is a sign of the<br>\
fem. gender, (Mughnee, K,) i. e., a particle applied<br>\
to denote the fem. gender, (Mughnee,) as in قَامَتْ<br>\
[She stood]. (Mughnee, K.) J says [in the S]<br>\
that, when thus added at the end of the pret., it<br>\
is a pronoun: but IB says [correctly] that it is<br>\
a particle. (TA.)<br>\
-A7-  It is also, sometimes, affixed<br>\
to ثُمَّ and رُبَّ; and in these cases it is most<br>\
commonly movent with fet-h, (Mughnee, K,) so<br>\
that one says ثُمَّتَ and رُبَّتَ. (TA.) [See arts.<br>\
ثم and رب.]<br>\
-A8-  تِ is an imperative of أَتَى. (M<br>\
in art. اتى.)<br>\
-A9-  [As a numeral, ت denotes Four<br>\
hundred.]<br>\
