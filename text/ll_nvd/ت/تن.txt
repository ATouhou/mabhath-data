voce تَوٌّ.<br>\
تُنٌّ and تُنَّةٌ The tunny-fish. (Golius on the<br>\
authority of Ibn-Beytár; and so in the present<br>\
day; but the former is a coll. gen. n., and the<br>\
latter is a n. un.)<br>\
تِنٌّ A like; an equal, a match, or a fellow;<br>\
(S, M, K;) as also ↓ تَنِينٌ; (K, TA [in the CK<br>\
تِنِين];) an equal in age; (T, M;) an equal in<br>\
intellect, or in weakness, or in strength, or in<br>\
manliness, or manly virtue: (ISk, S:) or a companion: (M:) pl. أَتْنَانٌ. (T, M.) You say, فُلَانٌ<br>\
تِنُّ فُلَانٍ [Such a one is the like, or equal, &amp;c.,<br>\
of such a one]. (S.) And هُوَ سِنُّهُ and تِنُّهُ and<br>\
حِتْنُهُ [He is his like, or equal, &amp;c.]. (T.) And<br>\
هُمَا تِنَّانِ They two are equals in intellect, or in<br>\
weakness, or in strength, or in manliness, or manly<br>\
virtue. (ISk, S.) And صِبْوَةٌ أَتْنَانٌ [Boys that<br>\
are like each other, or equals, &amp;c.]. (T.) And<br>\
هُمْ أَسْنَانٌ أَتْنَانٌ They are equals in age. (IAar,<br>\
T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A boy stunted by disease, (Lth, T, M,) so<br>\
that he does not attain to full growth; (Lth, T;)<br>\
as also ↓ تَنٌّ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also i. q. شَخْصٌ [The<br>\
body, or corporeal form, of a man or other thing,<br>\
which one sees from a distance; or a person;<br>\
an individual]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And i. q. مِثَالٌ [A model;<br>\
a pattern; &amp;c.]: (T:) and ↓ تِينَانٌ [likewise] signifies the مثال of a thing. (K.)<br>\
تَنِينٌ: see تِنٌّ.<br>\
تِنِّينٌ [in Hebr. 165] A great serpent; (K;)<br>\
a kind of serpent, (Lth, T, S, M,) one of the<br>\
greatest of serpents, (Lth, T,) or like the greatest<br>\
thereof: (M:) it is related that a company of<br>\
soldiers, on the shore of the Sea of Syria, saw<br>\
a cloud divide upon the sea, and then rise, and<br>\
they saw the tail of the تنّين in a state of commotion in the fringe of the cloud: it is also related<br>\
that a cloud carries the تنّين to the country of<br>\
Yájooj and Májooj [or Gog and Magog], and<br>\
casts it down there, and they assemble thereupon,<br>\
and eat its flesh: (T:) [these stories are fanciful<br>\
accounts of the natural phenomenon called a<br>\
water-spout, to which this name is applied by the<br>\
Arabs in the present day: but the word is generally understood to mean a dragon: and a great<br>\
sea-monster;] an aquatic animal, great in make,<br>\
terrible in appearance, long and broad in the<br>\
body, large in the head, having very glistening<br>\
eyes, wide mouth and inside, and many teeth:<br>\
it swallows many animals; the animals of the<br>\
land and of the sea fear it; and when it moves,<br>\
the sea becomes agitated with waves by reason of<br>\
its great strength: in its first state, it is a malignant serpent, that eats what it sees of the beasts<br>\
of the land; and when its mischief becomes great,<br>\
God sends an angel that carries it away, and<br>\
throws it to Yájooj and Májooj: it is related of<br>\
one that was seen to fall, that it was found to be<br>\
about two leagues in length, of a colour like that<br>\
of the leopard, with scales like those of a fish,<br>\
two great fins in form like those of a fish, a head<br>\
like a great hill, resembling the head of a man,<br>\
two long and great ears, and two round eyes;<br>\
and from its neck branched forth six other necks,<br>\
every one of them nearly twenty cubits long, and<br>\
every one of them having a head like that of the<br>\
serpent. (Kzw.) [Golius thinks it to mean The<br>\
shark (“carcharias”).] ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, التِّنِّينُ is (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
certain نَجْم [or constellation; the constellation<br>\
of the Dragon]; thus named as being likened<br>\
to the serpent so called; (M;) a constellation<br>\
containing thirty-one stars within the figure;<br>\
among which are those called الرَّاقِصُ and العَوَائِذُ<br>\
and الرُّبَعُ and الذِّئْبَانِ &amp;c. (Kzw, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Also,<br>\
app., (assumed tropical:)  A certain imaginary figure in the heavens,<br>\
extending along the line of the nodes of a planet,<br>\
which are called the dragon&#39;s head and the dragon&#39;s<br>\
tail, in Arabic الجَوْزَهَرُ (from the Persian گَوْزِهْرْ),<br>\
or الجَوْزَاهَرَانِ, and also العُقْدَتَانِ, and, to distinguish<br>\
each from the other, الرَّأْسُ وَالذَّنَبُ: this line<br>\
is supposed by Golius to be meant by the following description; but I incline to regard it as the<br>\
result of a confusion of a description of this line<br>\
with a description of the zodiacal light, a phenomenon supposed to have been unnoticed by the<br>\
Arabs:] a slight whiteness in the sky, (Lth, T,<br>\
K,) not an asterism, (Lth, T,) the body of which<br>\
is in six signs of the zodiac, and the tail, which<br>\
is slender, black, and twisted, in the seventh sign:<br>\
it changes place like the planets; is called in<br>\
Persian هَشْتَنْبَرْ, (Lth, T, K,) [app. a mistranscription of هَسْتَبُرْ,] in astrological computation; and<br>\
is inauspicious: (Lth, T:) accord. to J, a certain<br>\
place in the sky; which is a correct explanation, though said in the K to be a mistake.<br>\

art. and in art. تين:) but used only by El-Akhtal.<br>\
