load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'تينتِينٌ The tree of the بَلَس [or common fig; ficus<br>\
carica]: or the بلس itself: (M:) [or both; i. e.]<br>\
a certain well-known kind of tree; and the fruit<br>\
thereof: (TA:) [or the latter only;] a certain<br>\
thing that is eaten, (S, Msb,) well known: (Msb,<br>\
K:) fresh and ripe, it is the most approved of<br>\
fruits, and the most nutritious, and the least<br>\
flatulent; drawing, dissolvent, having the property of opening obstructions of the liver and<br>\
spleen, and laxative; and the eating much thereof<br>\
engenders lice: (K: [the last word in this explanation in the K is مُقْمِلٌ, which I render agreeably<br>\
with the TK, having found no authoritative explanation of it: but in my own opinion, the<br>\
meaning of this word is fattening, for قَمِلَ signifies “ he became fat after being lean; ” and my<br>\
opinion is confirmed by what here follows:]) it is<br>\
a pleasant fruit, having nothing redundant, and a<br>\
nice food, quick of digestion, and a very useful<br>\
medicine, for it has a laxative property, dissolves<br>\
phlegm, purifies the kidneys, removes sand of the<br>\
bladder, opens obstructions of the liver and spleen,<br>\
and fattens the body: it is also said, in a trad.,<br>\
that it stops hemorrhoids, and is good for the<br>\
gout: (Bd xcv. 1:) AHn says, there are many<br>\
kinds thereof; that of the desert, that of the<br>\
cultivated land, that of the plains, and that of<br>\
the mountains; and it is abundant in the land of<br>\
the Arabs: and he adds, on the authority of an<br>\
Arab of the desert, of the Saráh, that it is, in the<br>\
Saráh, very abundant, and allowed to be commonly taken; and is eaten by the people there in<br>\
its fresh state, and also dried and stored: (M:)<br>\
the word is Arabic: (Msb:) [a coll. gen. n.:]<br>\
n. un. with ة. (S, M, Msb.) This is what is<br>\
meant in the Kur [xcv. 1], where it is said,<br>\
وَالتِّينِ وَالزَّيْتُونِ, (T, S, M, Msb,) accord. to I&#39;Ab,<br>\
(T, S, Bd, Jel,) and the generality of the interpreters: (Msb:) or these two words mean two<br>\
mountains (S, M, Bd, Jel) of Syria, (S, Jel,) or<br>\
of the Holy Land, (Bd,) that produce the two<br>\
fruits thus named: (Jel:) or, accord. to a Syrian<br>\
interpreter, certain mountains extending from<br>\
Hulwán, to Hemdán, and the mountains of Syria:<br>\
(Fr, T:) or Damascus and Jerusalem: (M, Bd:)<br>\
or the mosque of Damascus and that of Jerusalem: (Bd:) or two mosques in Syria: accord.<br>\
to AHn, the former is the name of a mountain in<br>\
the country of Ghatafán; but there is no mountain thus called in Syria. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Among the<br>\
kinds of تِين is that called تِينُ الجُمَّيْزِ [The sycamore-fig; ficus sycomorus; also called the Egyptian fig]; describe voce جُمَّيْزٌ, q. v. (AHn.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[التِّينُ الإِفْرَنْجِىُّ and التِّينُ الشَّوْكِىُّ are appellations<br>\
applied in the present day to The Indian fig, or<br>\
prickly pear; cactus opuntia: Forskål (Flora<br>\
Aegypt. Arab. p. lxvii) applies the former name<br>\
to the cochineal Indian fig; cactus cochinillifer.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  التِّينَةُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The anus: (AHn, M,<br>\
K:) [opposed to الجُمَّيْزَةُ as meaning “ the pudendum muliebre. ”.]<br>\

تَاهَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَتِيهُ, (S, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. تِيهٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and تَيْهٌ (K) and<br>\
تَيَهَانٌ, (S, K,) is syn. with تَاهَ having for its aor.<br>\
يَتُوهُ; (Msb, TA;) [and with طَاحَ, aor. يَطِيحُ<br>\
and يَطُوحُ;] signifying He deviated from, or<br>\
lost, or missed, the right way; he lost his way;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) in the desert: (Mgh, Msb:)<br>\
he was, or became, confounded, or perplexed, and<br>\
unable to see his right course: (Mgh:) he went<br>\
away in the land, confounded, or perplexed, and<br>\
unable to see his right course: (S, TA:) [or his<br>\
mind, or intellect, was, or became, disordered,<br>\
confused, or unsound: (see تَاهَ in art. توه:)] and<br>\
he perished. (TA in art. توه.) You say also,<br>\
تَاهَتْ بِهِ سَفِينَتُهُ His ship deviated from the right<br>\
course with him. (TA.) And تَاهَ عَنِّى بَصَرُكَ<br>\
Thine eye, or thy sight, passed me over; syn.<br>\
تَخَطَّى. (Aboo-Turáb, TA.) تَاهَ بَصَرَهُ [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, قَصْرُهُ] signifies also تَافَ, (K, TA,<br>\
[in the CK نافَ,] i. e., accord. to &#39;Arrám, He<br>\
looked at a thing continually, or continuously<br>\
(فِى دَوَامٍ [app. as one confounded, or perplexed,<br>\
and unable to see aright]). (Aboo-Turáb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, تَاهَ, (S, K,) aor. يَتِيهُ, (S,) inf. n. تِيهٌ, (S,<br>\
K,) and تِيَهٌ is said to be a dial. var. of this, but<br>\
is doubtful; (MF;) [like تَاهَ having for its aor.<br>\
يَتُوهُ;] He magnified himself; or behaved proudly,<br>\
haughtily, or insolently: (S, K:) and he affected<br>\
to be commended for, or praised for, or he gloried<br>\
in, that which he did not possess; [i. e. he was,<br>\
or became, conceited, or vain-glorious; or he<br>\
overpassed the due bounds in elegance of mind or<br>\
manners or address or speech or person or attire<br>\
and the like, and arrogated to himself superiority<br>\
therein, through pride: (K:) [or rather, he was,<br>\
or became, vain; or he behaved vainly: for] Er-Rághib makes a distinction between مُعْجَبٌ and<br>\
تَائِهٌ; saying that the معجب believes himself<br>\
with respect to the opinion or judgment that he<br>\
forms of himself indecisively, from evidence outweighed in probability; whereas the تائه believes<br>\
himself decisively. (MF and TA in art. عجب.)<br>\
One says, هُوَ يَتِيهُ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ [He behaves proudly,<br>\
or conceitedly, or vainly, towards his people].<br>\

perplexed, and unable to see his tight course:<br>\
&amp;c.: see 1:] he destroyed, or lost, or left or<br>\
neglected, him or it. (K.) And تيّه نَفْسَهُ He<br>\
