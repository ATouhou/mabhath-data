تَعَسَ, aor.<br>\
تَعَسَ, inf. n. تَعْسٌ; (S, A, Msb, K,<br>\
&amp;c.;) and تَعسَ, aor.<br>\
تَعَسَ; (Sh, AHeyth, A, IAth,<br>\
K;) but the latter is not chaste; (A, TA;) or<br>\
the former is used in addressing a person, saying<br>\
تَعَسْتَ; and the latter, in narration; (K;) accord.<br>\
to Sh; but ISd says that this is strange; (TA;)<br>\
He fell, having stumbled; contr. of اِنْتَعَشَ: this<br>\
is the primary signification: (S:) or he stumbled<br>\
and fell (AHeyth, A, IAth, K) upon his hands<br>\
and mouth, (AHeyth, TA,) or upon his face:<br>\
(IAth, TA:) or he fell upon his face: (Er-Rustamee, Msb, TA:) [and this may also be<br>\
meant by one of the explanations of the inf. n.<br>\
in the TA, which is نُكْسٌ فِى سَفَالٍ:] or he fell<br>\
in any manner. (TA.) You say, by way of<br>\
imprecation, تَعَسَ وَانْتَكَسَ, meaning May he<br>\
fall upon his face, and not rise after his fall<br>\
until he fall a second time. (Msb.) And تَعَسَ<br>\
فَمَا انْتَعَشَ وَشِيكَ فَلَا انْتَقَشَ [May he fall, having<br>\
stumbled, or stumble and fall, &amp;c., and not rise<br>\
again; and may he be pricked with a thorn, and<br>\
not extract the thorn]. (TA.) And accord. to<br>\
certain of the Kilábees, تَعَسَ signifies He missed<br>\
his proof in litigation, and the object of his search<br>\
in seeking. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He perished. (Aboo-&#39;Amr<br>\
Ibn-El-&#39;Alà, S, K.) You say, تَعَسْتَ, as though<br>\
meaning Mayest thou perish. (ISh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
He became far removed. (A, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He became<br>\
lowered, or degraded. (A, K.) You say also,<br>\
تَعَسَ جَدُّهُ [His fortune, or good fortune, fell:<br>\
or may his fortune, or good fortune, fall]. (K<br>\
in art. عثر.)<br>\
-A2-  تَعَسَهُ اللّٰهُ, [aor.<br>\
تَعَسَ, inf. n. تَعْسٌ;]<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, A, Msb, K;) and ↓ اتعسهُ; (AHeyth,<br>\
S, A, Msb, K;) the former unknown to Sb; (Az,<br>\
TA;) God made him to fall, having stumbled:<br>\
(S:) or to stumble and fall (AHeyth, A, K) upon<br>\
his hands and mouth, (AHeyth, TA,) or upon his<br>\
face: (TA:) or to fall upon his face: (Msb:)<br>\
or to fall in any manner. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  God destroyed him; or made him to perish. (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  God made him to become far removed.<br>\
(A, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  God lowered, or degraded, him. (A,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  You say, by way of imprecation, تَعْسًا لَهُ<br>\
May he [fall, having stumbled: or, stumble and<br>\
fall: or, stumble and fall upon his hands and<br>\
mouth: or, upon his face: or] fall upon his face:<br>\
(Msb:) or may God make destruction to cleave<br>\
to him: (S, TA:) [or may God destroy him.]<br>\
Aboo-Is-hák says, in explanation of the phrase<br>\
فَتَعْسًا لَهُمْ, in the Kur xlvii. 9, that it may be in<br>\
the accus. case as meaning اللّٰهُ ↓ أَتْعَسَهُمُ. (TA.)<br>\
A man also says, by way of imprecation, to his<br>\
swift and excellent camel, when it stumbles, تَعْسًا,<br>\
meaning May God throw thee down upon thy<br>\
nostrils: expressing his disapproval of the stumbling of a beast of such age and strength: but if<br>\
it be not a swift and excellent beast, and stumble,<br>\
he says to it لَعًا. (TA.) You say also, اللّٰهُ ↓ أَتْعَسَ<br>\
جَدَّهُ [May God make his fortune, or good fortune,<br>\
to sink!] (A.)<br>\

أَتْعَسَ see تَعَسَهُ, in three places.<br>\
تَعْسٌ inf. n. of 1 [which see, throughout]. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also Evil; mischief. (K.)<br>\
تَعِسٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
تَاعِسٌ (A, K) and ↓ تَعِسٌ (Msb, K) act. part. ns.<br>\
of 1, [i. e., respectively, of تَعَسَ and تَعِسَ, accord.<br>\
to rule, used intransitively,] (A, Msb, K,) both<br>\
applied to a man: (K:) and the former, to<br>\
fortune, or good fortune. (A.)<br>\
مَتْعَسَةٌ [A cause of falling after stumbling: or<br>\
of stumbling and falling &amp;c. (See 1.)] You say,<br>\
هٰذَا الأَمْرُ مَنْحَسَةٌ مَتْعَسَةٌ [This affair is a cause<br>\
of ill luck; a cause of falling &amp;c.]. (A, TA.)<br>\
