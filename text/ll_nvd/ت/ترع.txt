and تُرُعَاتٌ: (Msb:) in the S it is said to signify<br>\

the sentence should be, تُرَعٌ is pl. of تُرْعَةٌ, and has<br>\
this signification. (IB.) ―<br>\

of water, to a meadow or garden or the like: (L,<br>\

said in a trad., إِنَّ مِنْبَرِي هٰذَا عَلَى تُرْعَةٍ مِنْ تُرَعِ<br>\
الجَنَّةِ, (S, TA,) as though meaning, (tropical:)  Verily this<br>\
my pulpit is at a gate of the gates of Paradise:<br>\
thus explained by Sahl Ibn-Saad Es-Sá&#39;idee, the<br>\
relater of the trad.; and A&#39;Obeyd says, وَهُوَ الوَجْهُ<br>\
[“ and it is the proper,” or “ the valid and obvious,<br>\
way,” of explaining it], meaning that it is the<br>\
preferable explanation: but the author of the K,<br>\
mistaking his meaning, makes وَجْهٌ to be another<br>\
signification of تُرْعَةٌ: or the meaning of this trad.<br>\
is, he who acts according to the exhortations<br>\
recited upon the steps of my pulpit will enter<br>\
Paradise: or, accord. to Kt, prayer and praise in<br>\
this place are means of attaining to Paradise; so<br>\
that it is as though it were a portion of Paradise.<br>\
(TA.) In the same manner Sahl explained his<br>\
other trad,, إِنَّ قَدَمِى عَلَى تُرْعَةٍ مِنْ تُرَعِ الحَوْضِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Verily my foot is at a gate of the gates of the<br>\
pool of Paradise]. (TA.)<br>\

تَرَّاعٌ A torrent filling the valley; as also ↓ أَتْرَعُ:<br>\
(K:) or a torrent which fills the valley: (S:) and<br>\
↓ the latter, a vehement torrent. (TA.) J says,<br>\
in the S, that ↓ سَيْرٌ أَنْزَعُ signifies شَدِيدٌ; and he<br>\
cites the words of a poet thus:<br>\
فَافْتَرَشَ الأَرْضَ بِسَيْرٍ أَتْرَعَا<br>\
ascribed by some to El-&#39;Ajjáj, but correctly, accord.<br>\
to IB, the words of Ru-beh; making two mistakes, in saying افترش, in the sing., and بسير:<br>\
moreover, the last word in the citation is a pret.<br>\
verb: [the right reading is]<br>\
فَافْتَرَشُوا الأَرْضَ بِسَيْلٍ أَتْرَعَا<br>\
[And they travelled the land with a multitude<br>\
like a torrent that filled the valleys]: the poet<br>\
describes the Benoo-Temeem, and their travelling<br>\
the land like the torrent by reason of multitude.<br>\
(Sgh, TA.)<br>\
