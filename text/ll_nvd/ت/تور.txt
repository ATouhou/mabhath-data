Such a one is encompassed, or gone round, (يُدَارُ,)<br>\
in order that he may be taken: and he cites, from<br>\
a poem of &#39; Ámir Ibn-Ketheer El-Moháribee,<br>\
لَقَدْ غَضِبُوا عَلَىَّ وَأَشْقَذُونِى<br>\
فَصِرْتُ كَأَنَّنِى فَرَأٌ يُتَارُ<br>\
[as though meaning They have been angry with<br>\
me, and driven me away, and I have become as<br>\
though I were a wild ass encompassed in order to<br>\
be taken]: or, accord. as some relate it, ↓ مُتَارُ:<br>\

people, (S, M, K,) or that goes about between<br>\

K,) from which one drinks: (S, Mgh, K:) a<br>\
vessel of brass, or of stone, like the إِجَّانَة: (TA:)<br>\
sometimes also used for the ablution termed وُضُوْء:<br>\
(A, Mgh, TA:) so called from the same word<br>\
as signifying the act of “ running ” or “ flowing ”<br>\
[of water], (TA,) because it is mutually borrowed<br>\
and returned; or from the same word as signifying “ a messenger: ” (A, TA:) of the masc.<br>\
gender: (T, A, K:) [or fem., for Z says,] I<br>\
passed, at the Gate of El-&#39;Omrah, [of the Temple<br>\
of Mekkeh,] by a woman who was saying to her<br>\
female neighbour, أَعِيرِينِى تُوَيْرَتَكِ [Lend thou to<br>\

تَارَةٌ, originally with ء, which is suppressed on<br>\
account of frequent usage, (IAar, Msb,) and<br>\
sometimes pronounced with ء; (Msb;) or its ا is<br>\
[originally] و [and therefore it is mentioned in<br>\
most of the lexicons in the present art.]; (Lth,<br>\
T;) [or ى, for it is mentioned in the S in art.<br>\
تير;] A time; one time; [in the sense of the<br>\
French fois;] syn. مَرَّةٌ: (S, M, A, Msb, K:) and<br>\
a time, whether long or short; syn. حِينٌ: (M,<br>\
K:) sometimes [pronounced ↓ تَارٌ,] without ة:<br>\
(S:) pl. تَارَاتٌ (Lth, T, S, M, Msb, K) and تِيَرٌ;<br>\
(Lth, T, S, M, K;) the latter a contraction of<br>\
تِيَارٌ; like as they said قَامَاتٌ and قِيَمٌ, because of<br>\
the unsound letter. (S. [See also art. تأر.]) You<br>\
say, فَعَلَ ذٰلِكَ تَارَةً بَعْدَ تَارَةً He did that time after<br>\
time. (S.) And هٰذِهِ شَرٌّ تَارَاتِكَ This is the worst<br>\

-A2-  يَا تَارَاتِ فُلَانٍ [app. meaning O the blood-revenge of such a one!] (M, K)<br>\
is mentioned by Lh, (M,) or AA, (TA,) but not<br>\
explained by him: and he cites the saying of<br>\
Hassán,<br>\
لَتَسْمَعَنَّ وَشِيكًا فِى دِيَارِهِمُ<br>\
اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ يَا تَارَاتِ عُثْمَانَ<br>\
[which probably means Thou wilt assuredly hear<br>\
speedily, in their abodes, “God is most great! O<br>\
the blood-revenge of &#39;Othmán! ” for ISd says,]<br>\
in my opinion, (M,) تارات is formed by transposition from وِتْرٌ signifying blood [or rather bloodrevenge], (M, K, *) though not agreeing with it<br>\
in measure: (M:) and وشيكا here means سَرِيعًا:<br>\
so says IB. (TA in art. وشك.) [See also ثَأْرٌ.]<br>\
تَائِرٌ Applying himself constantly, or perseveringly, to work, after remitting, or remissness.<br>\
