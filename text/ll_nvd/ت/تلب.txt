اِتْلَأَبَّ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) inf. n. اِتْلِئْبَابٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) It (a thing, M, or an affair, or a case, S,<br>\
K, or a road, A) was, or became, uniform or<br>\
undeviating, (A,) right, or rightly directed or<br>\
ordered: (S, M, A, K:) or (M) it (a thing, M,<br>\
or a road, S, K) was, or became, extended, (Fr,<br>\
T, S, M, A, K,) and right, direct, even, or uniform: (S, M, K: *) or (M) it (a thing, M) was,<br>\
or became, set up, or erect. (M, A, K.) You say,<br>\
مَرُّوا فَانْلَأَبَّ بِهِمُ الطَّرِيقُ [They went along, and<br>\
the road was, or became, uniform, &amp;c., with them;<br>\
i. e., their road was, or became, uniform, &amp;c.].<br>\
(A.) And اتلأبّ أَمْرُهُمْ [Their affair, or case,<br>\
was, or became, right, or rightly directed or<br>\
ordered]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He (an ass) raised his breast<br>\
and head. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  This verb and its derivatives are mentioned in the [T and] S and K in<br>\
the present art.; but they are held by [ISd and]<br>\
IB to be radically quadriliteral. (TA.)<br>\
تَلْبٌ Loss; or the state of being lost; or perdition. (A, K.) One says, تَبًّا لَهُ تَلْبًا, (Lth, T,) or<br>\
تَبًّا لَهُ وَتَلْبًا [which may be rendered May God<br>\
decree loss and perdition to him]. (K.)<br>\
تُلَأْبِيبَةٌ a subst. (S, M, K) from اِتْلَأَبَّ; (Fr,<br>\
T, S, M, K;) [signifying The state of being uniform or undeviating, right, &amp;c.;] like طُمَأْنِينَةٌ<br>\
[from اِطْمَأَنَّ]. (TA.)<br>\
تَوْلَبٌ, perfectly decl. [when used as a proper<br>\
name as well as when used as an appellative],<br>\
because it is of the measure فَوْعَلٌ; (Sb, S;) for<br>\
we judge its ت to be a radical, and its و to be<br>\
augmentative, because فَوْعَل is more common [as<br>\
the measure of a noun] than تَفْعَل; (M;) but<br>\
accord. to Suh, the ت is a substitute for و, and,<br>\
if so, it should be mentioned in art. ولب; (TA;)<br>\
A young ass; syn. جَحْشٌ: (S, K:) or the foal<br>\
of a wild ass, when he has completed a year.<br>\
(M.) And أُمُّ تَوْلَب is an appellation given to<br>\
The she-ass. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The former is sometimes<br>\
metaphorically applied to (tropical:)  A [young] man: (M:)<br>\
or a boy. (S.)<br>\
مُتْلَئِبٌّ [Uniform or undeviating,] right, or<br>\
rightly directed or ordered [&amp;c.: see the verb];<br>\
as also مُسْلَحِبٌّ. (Asudot;, T) Also applied to a rule,<br>\
(A, TA,) as meaning Uniform, undeviating, or<br>\
of general application; uniformly, or constantly,<br>\

where a wound causes death; syn. مَقَاتِلُ. (IAar,<br>\
T.)<br>\
