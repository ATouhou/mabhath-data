incumbent]. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  [Golius says, as on the<br>\
authority of the KL, that رَسَلَ signifies Nuncium<br>\
misit: but what I find in the KL is, that رَسُولٌ,<br>\
as an inf. n., signifies the bringing a message<br>\
(پيغام بردن) : whence it seems that رَسَلَ means he<br>\
brought a message.]<br>\
2<br>\

i. q. تَرْتِيلٌ; (K, TA;) i. e. (TA) Easy [or<br>\

قِرّآءَتِهِ signifies he proceeded in a leisurely manner<br>\
in his reading, or reciting, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
and was grave, staid, sedate, or calm, (Mgh,)<br>\
and endeavoured to understand, without raising<br>\
his voice much. (TA.) It is said in a trad., كَانَ<br>\
فِى كَلَامِهِ تَرْسِيلٌ i. e. تَرْتِيلٌ [There was in his<br>\
(Mohammad&#39;s) speech an easy, or a leisurely,<br>\

interchanges messages, or letters, with him by<br>\
means of those who demand women in marriage].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] راسلهُ فِى نِضَالٍ أَوْ غَيْرِهِ [He<br>\
acted interchangeably, or alternated, with him in<br>\
a competition in shooting, or in some other performance]. (S.) And راسلهُ فِى الغِنَآءِ, and العَمَلِ,<br>\

إِرْسَالٌ signifies The act of sending. (K, KL,<br>\
&amp;c.) Thus is explained إِرْسَالُ اللّٰهِ أَنْبِيَآءَهُ [i. e.<br>\

↓ أَرْسَلْتُ فُلَانًا فِى رِسَالَةٍ (S) I sent such a one with<br>\
a message. (PS.) And ↓ ارسل إِلَيْهِ رَسُولًا (MA,<br>\

الكَافِرِينَ تَؤُزُّهُمْ أَزًّا, i. e. [We have made the devils<br>\
to have dominion, &amp;c., over the unbelievers, inciting them strongly to acts of disobedience; or]<br>\
we have appointed, or prepared, the devils for the<br>\
unbelievers, because of their unbelief; like as is<br>\
said in the same [xliii. 35], نُقَيِّضْ لَهُ شَيْطَانًا [“ We<br>\
will appoint, or prepare, for him a devil ” as an<br>\
associate]: this is the preferred explanation: [or<br>\
it may be well rendered we have sent the devils<br>\
against the unbelievers:] some say that the meaning is, we have left the devils to do as they please<br>\
with the unbelievers, not withholding them, or preserving them, from acceptance from them. (Zj,<br>\
M.)<br>\
-A2-  ارسلوا [from رِسْلٌ] They had milk in their<br>\

تراسلوا They sent, one to another, (MA,<br>\
Msb, TA,) a message [or messages], (MA, Msb,)<br>\

his voice, but being unable to continue long enough<br>\
to accomplish the cadence, and therefore pausing,<br>\

استرسل It (a thing) was, or became, loose,<br>\
or slack; syn. سَلِسَ. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Said of hair:<br>\

he acted forwardly, or impudently, towards him:<br>\
he acted forwardly, impudently, freely, or familiarly, towards him, in the way of coquetry, or<br>\

فِيهِمْ فَأَفْنَاهُمْ [(assumed tropical:)  Fate made free with them, and<br>\

-A2-  Also He<br>\
said, Send thou to me the camels in droves (أَرْسَالًا<br>\
[in the CK, erroneously, اِرْسالًا]); (K, TA;)<br>\
ارسالا being with fet-h to the hemzeh; i. e. drove<br>\
after drove: for the camels, when they come to the<br>\
water, are numerous; and their tender brings<br>\
them to the watering-trough thus; not all together, as in this case they would press together<br>\
upon the watering-trough and not satisfy their<br>\
thirst. (TA.)<br>\
رَسْلٌ Easy; applied to a pace. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Easy in pace; applied to a he-camel: fem. with<br>\
ة: (S, M, K:) or soft, or gentle, in pace; applied<br>\

former of these significations; and its pl. is مَرَاسِيلُ:<br>\
(S, K:) or this pl. signifies light, or active, she-camels, that give thee what they have to give<br>\
spontaneously; and رَسْلَةٌ is applied to one thereof:<br>\
a she-camel is termed ↓ مِرْسَالٌ as being likened to<br>\
the arrow thus called. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Soft, and lax,<br>\
or flaccid: [app. applied to a he-camel; for it is<br>\
added,] one says نَاقَةٌ رَسْلَةٌ القَوَائِمِ, meaning A<br>\
she-camel loose, or slack, [in the legs, and] soft in<br>\
the joints [thereof]. (TA. [See also another<br>\
meaning assigned to this phrase in what follows.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Applied to hair, i. q. ↓ مُسْتَرْسِلٌ; (S, K; in the<br>\
CK مُرْسَل;) which means Lank; not crisp:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb: [and so accord. to an explanation of<br>\
استرسل in the S and K:]) or lank and pendent:<br>\
(Msb:) or long, and lank or pendent. (AZ, Az,<br>\

L, TA,) Having much hair, (M,) or much and<br>\
long hair, (L, TA,) upon her shanks, or hind<br>\
legs (فِى سَاقِيْهَا): (M, L, TA:) but in the K, رَسْلَةٌ<br>\
and ↓ مُرَاسِلٌ [not مِرْسَالٌ] are explained as epithets<br>\
applied to a woman, meaning having much and<br>\
long hair upon her shanks. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also sing.<br>\
of ↓ رِسَالٌ, (TA,) which signifies The legs of a<br>\
camel: (AZ, S, K, TA:) so called because of<br>\
their length. (AZ, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also مُرَاسِلٌ.<br>\
-A3-<br>\
And see the paragraph here next following.<br>\
رِسْلٌ Gentleness; and a deliberate, or leisurely,<br>\
manner of acting or behaving; as also ↓ رِسْلَةٌ;<br>\
(M, K;) [and perhaps ↓ رَسْلٌ and ↓ رَسْلَةٌ; for]<br>\
one says اِفْعَلْ كَذَا وَكَذَا عَلَى رِسْلِكَ (S, Mgh, *<br>\
Msb, * CK * [but not in my MS. copy of the K<br>\
nor in the copies used by SM]) and رَسْلِكَ and<br>\
رَسْلَتِكَ, (CK, [but likewise wanting in MS. copies<br>\
of the K,]) i. e. [Do thou such and such things]<br>\
at thine ease; (Msb;) or act thou gently, deliberately, or leisurely, (S, Mgh, K, *) in doing<br>\
such and such things; like as one says, عَلَى هِينَتِكَ.<br>\
(S.) Sakhr-el-Ghei says, when despairing of his<br>\
companions&#39; overtaking him, his enemies surrounding him, and he feeling sure of slaughter,<br>\
(M,)<br>\
لَوْ أَنَّ حَوْلِى مِنْ قُرَيْمٍ رَجْلَا<br>\
بِيضَ الوَجُوهِ يَحْمِلُونَ النَّبْلَا<br>\
لَمَنَعُونِى نَجْدَةً أَوْ رِسْلَا<br>\
(Skr, M, *) i. e. [If there were around me, of the<br>\
family of Kureym, men on foot, fair in the faces<br>\
(app. meant tropically), bearing arrows, they<br>\
would defend me] by violent means or by gentle<br>\
means: (Skr:) or with fighting or without fighting. (M.) [See also a phrase cited from a trad.<br>\
in what follows of this paragraph.] One says<br>\
also, ↓ جَاؤُوا رِسْلَةً رِسْلَةً They came company by<br>\
company. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A soft, gentle, saying or<br>\
speech. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Milk, (S, M, K,) of<br>\
whatever sort it be: (M, K:) or, accord. to the<br>\
Towsheeh, fresh milk. (TA.) One says, كَثُرَ<br>\
الرِّسْلُ العَامَ, meaning Milk has become abundant<br>\
this year: and the people of the desert assert that,<br>\
when this is the case, dates are few; and that,<br>\
when dates are abundant, milk is scarce. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in a trad. [respecting the giving of<br>\
the poor-rate], إِلَّا مَنْ أَعْطَى فِى نَجْدَتِهَا وَرِسْلِهَا,<br>\
(S, TA,) which is explained in two different<br>\
ways: (TA:) [J says that] it is from رِسْلٌ in the<br>\
sense first explained above; meaning straitness<br>\
and plenty; i. e. Except him who gives when they<br>\
are fat and goodly, when it is difficult, or hard,<br>\
to their owner to give them forth, and when they<br>\
are lean, [or] in a middling condition: (S:) and<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd says the like; and that it is similar to<br>\
the saying, قَالَ فُلَانٌ كَذَا عَمَّا رِسْلِهِ, meaning<br>\
Such a one said such a thing holding it (the<br>\
saying) in light estimation: others say that it is<br>\
from رِسْلٌ signifying “ milk; ” which A&#39;Obeyd<br>\
disallows: IAth says that what is meant by نجدة<br>\
is straitness and drought or barrenness or dearth;<br>\
and by رسل, plenty, and abundance of herbage or<br>\
the like; because رسل, i. e. milk, is plentiful only<br>\
in the case of abundance of herbage; so that the<br>\
meaning is, except him who gives forth the due<br>\
of God in the case of straitness and in that of<br>\
plenty. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  The رِسْلَانِ of a horse are The<br>\
extremities of the عَضُدَانِ [or two arms].<br>\
(M, K. *)<br>\
رَسَلٌ Camels: (M, K:) thus expl. by A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
without any epithet: (M:) or a drove, or herd,<br>\
or a distinct collection or number, of camels, (S,<br>\
M, * Msb, K,) and of sheep or goats, (S, K,)<br>\
accord. to ISk from ten to twenty-five, (TA,) or<br>\
the رَسَل of the watering-trough is at least ten,<br>\
and extending to twenty-five; and the word is<br>\
masc. and fem.; (M;) and also (assumed tropical:)  of horses or<br>\
horsemen; (S;) applied to (tropical:)  a company of men<br>\
(Mgh, Msb) as being likened to a drove, or herd,<br>\
of camels: (Msb:) and also a distinct collection<br>\
or number of any things: (M, K:) pl. أَرْسَالٌ.<br>\
(S, M, Mgh, Msb, K.) A rájiz says,<br>\
يَا ذَائِدَيْهَا خَوِّصَا بِأَرْسَالْ<br>\
وَلَا تَذُودَاهَا ذِيَادَ الضُّلَّالْ<br>\
[O ye two drivers of them, water some before<br>\
others, by droves, and drive them not with the<br>\
driving of those who err from the right way]:<br>\
(S, TA:) i. e. bring near your camels some after<br>\
some, and do not let them crowd upon the water-ing-trough. (TA.) And one says, جَآءَتِ الإِبِلُ رَسَلًا<br>\
The camels came [in a drove, or] following one<br>\
another. (IAmb, TA.) And جَآءَتِ الخَيْلُ أَرْسَالًا,<br>\
i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [The horses, or horsemen, came] in successive<br>\
distinct companies. (S, TA.) And جَاءُوا أَرْسَالًا<br>\
(tropical:)  They (men) came in successive companies.<br>\
(Msb. [And the like is said in the Mgh and in<br>\
the TA.]) وَقِيرٌ كَثِيرُ الرَّسَلِ قَلِيلُ الرِّسْلِ, occurring<br>\
in a trad. relating to a drought, is said by IKt to<br>\
mean [A collection of sheep or goats] of which<br>\
many were sent to the pasture, i. e. many in number, but having little milk but the more probable<br>\
explanation of كثير الرسل is that of El-&#39;Odhree,<br>\
who says that it means much dispersed in search<br>\
of pasture: for the trad. relates that the camels<br>\
had died, notwithstanding their ability to endure<br>\
drought: how then should the sheep or goats be<br>\
safe, and increase so as to become numerous?<br>\
(IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Animals, or beasts, having<br>\
milk. (M, TA.)<br>\
رُسُلٌ A young girl, that has not worn the<br>\
[muffler, or veil, called] خَمَار. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also a pl.<br>\
of رَسُولٌ. (S, M, &amp;c.)<br>\
رَسْلَةٌ A soft, or delicate condition of life: you<br>\
say, هُمْ فِى رَسْلَةٍ مِنَ العَيْشِ They are in a soft,<br>\
or delicate, condition of life. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
Heaviness, sluggishness, laziness, or indolence:<br>\
(M, K:) you say رَجُلٌ فِيهِ رَسْلَةٌ A man in whom<br>\
is heaviness, &amp;c. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also رِسْلٌ, first<br>\
sentence.<br>\
رِسْلَةٌ: see رِسْلٌ, in two places.<br>\
رِسَالٌ: see رَسْلٌ (of which it is the pl.), near the<br>\
end of the paragraph:<br>\
-A2-  and see also مُرَاسِلٌ.<br>\
رَسُولٌ i. q. رِسَالَةٌ: (S, M, K:) see the latter, in<br>\
five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, as meaning ذُو رَسُولٍ, i. e.<br>\
ذُو رِسَالَةٍ [One who has a message; i. e. a messenger]; (TA;) i. q. ↓ مُرْسَلٌ, (S, M, K,) meaning<br>\
one sent with a message; (S;) of the measure<br>\
فَعُولٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ [or rather<br>\
مُفْعَلٌ]: (Msb:) [and often meaning an apostle<br>\
of God; and with the article ال especially applied<br>\
to Mohammad:] accord. to IAmb, its meaning<br>\
in the proper language of the Arabs is one who<br>\
carries on by consecutive progressions the relation<br>\
of the tidings of him who has sent him; taken<br>\
from the phrase جَآءَتِ الإِبِلُ رَسَلًا, meaning “ The<br>\
camels came following one another: ” and the<br>\
saying of the Muëdhdhin, أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ اللّٰه<br>\
means I know [or acknowledge] and declare that<br>\
Mohammad is the relater by consecutive progressions of the tidings from God: (TA:) [or,<br>\
as commonly understood, I testify that Mohammad is the apostle of God:] a رَسُول is also called<br>\
↓ مِرْسَالٌ, as being likened to the arrow thus<br>\
termed: (TA:) the pl. of رَسُولٌ is رُسُلٌ (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K) and رُسْلٌ (S, Msb) and رُسَلَآءٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
which last is from IAar, (M,) or Fr, (Sgh,) and<br>\
أَرْسُلٌ, (M, K,) which [is a pl. of pauc., and]<br>\
occurs in the saying of the Hudhalee,<br>\
لَوْكَانَ فِى قَلْبِى كَقَدْرِ قُلَامَةٍ<br>\
حُبًا لِغَيْرِكِ قَدْ أَتَاهَا أَرْسُلِى<br>\
[Had there been in my heart as much as a nailparing of love for another than thee, my messengers (or, accord. to the TA, app., my messages)<br>\
had come to her]: respecting which IJ says that<br>\
he has given to رَسُولٌ this form of pl., which is<br>\
[regularly] proper to feminines [of this class of<br>\
words, consisting of four letter whereof the third<br>\
is a letter of prolongation], such as أَتَانٌ and<br>\
عَنَاقٌ and عُقَابٌ, because women are meant thereby, as they, generally, are the persons required<br>\
to serve in cases of this kind: (M:) [for] رَسُولٌ<br>\
is applied without variation to a male and a<br>\
female, and to one [and to two] and to a pl.<br>\
number; (S, M, Msb, K;) sometimes: (M:)<br>\
i. e., it is allowable thus to apply it: (Msb:)<br>\
hence, (S, K,) in the Kur [xxvi. 15], (S,) إِنَّا<br>\
رَسُولُ رَبِّ العَالَمِينَ [Verily we are the apostles of<br>\
the Lord of the beings of the whole world]: (S,<br>\
K:) MF says, in ch. xx. [verse 49], we find<br>\
إِنَّا رَسُولَا رَبِّكَ [Verily we are the two apostles of<br>\
thy Lord]; the dual form being here used: and<br>\
Z says, in the Ksh, that in this instance it means<br>\
the messengers, and therefore the dual form is<br>\
necessarily used; but in ch. xxvi. it means the<br>\
message, and therefore it is allowable to use it<br>\
alike, when applying it as an epithet, as sing.<br>\
and dual and pl.: Aboo-Is-hak the Grammarian<br>\
says that the meaning here is, إِنَّا رِسَالَةٌ رَبِّ العَالَمِينَ,<br>\
i. e. ذَوُو رِسالَةِ [Verily we are those that have the<br>\
message &amp;c.]: (TA:) [but] رَسُولٌ [as meaning a<br>\
messenger] is like عَدُوٌّ and صَديقٌ [&amp;c.] in its<br>\
being used alike as masc. and fem. and sing. [and<br>\
dual] and pl.: (Sgh, TA:) Aboo-Dhu-eyb uses<br>\
it in the sense of رُسُل in his saying,<br>\
أَلِكْنِى إِلَيْهَا وَخَيْرُ الرَّسُو<br>\
لِ أَعْلَمُهُمْ بِنَوَاحِى الخَبَرْ<br>\
[Be thou my messenger to her: and the best of<br>\
messengers is the most knowing of them in respect<br>\
of the bounds, or limits, of the tidings]. (M.)<br>\
See 4. The saying in the Kur [xxv. 39], وَقَوْمَ<br>\
نُوحٍ لَمَّ كَذَّبُوا الرُّسُلَ أَغْرَقْنَاهُمْ [lit. And the<br>\
people of Noah, when they charged with lying<br>\
the apostles, we drowned them], Zj says, may<br>\
mean that they charged with lying Noah alone;<br>\
for he who charges with lying a prophet charges<br>\
therewith all the prophets, since they believe in<br>\
God and in all his apostles; or the general term<br>\
may be here used as meaning one; like as when<br>\
you say, أَنْتَ مِمَّنْ يُنْفِقُ الدَّرَاهِمَ, meaning “ Thou<br>\
art of those who expend the kind of things<br>\
termed دراهم. ” (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  One says also, السِّهَامُ<br>\
رُسُلُ المَنَايَا (tropical:)  [Arrows are the messengers of death,<br>\
or of the decrees of death]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also<br>\
the next paragraph.<br>\
رَسِيلٌ Easy: occurring in the saying of Jubeyhà El-Asadee,<br>\
وَقُمْتُ رَسِيلًا بِالَّذِى جَآءَ يَبْتَغِى<br>\
إِلَيْهِ بَلِيجَ الوَجْهِ لَسْتُ بِبَاسِرِ<br>\

race, that is sent among the شَوْل [or she-camels<br>\

may leap them: one says, هٰذَا رَسِيلُ بَنِى فُلَانٍ<br>\
This is the stallion of the camels of the sons of<br>\
such a one: and أَرْسَلَ بَنُو فُلَانٍ رَسِيلَهُمْ [The sons<br>\
of such a one sent the stallion of their camels]: as<br>\
though it were of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense<br>\
of the measure مُفْعَلٌ, from أَرْسَلَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
accord. to some, A horse that is started with<br>\
another in a race. (Har p. 544.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [In the<br>\
CK and in a MS. copy of the K, voce عَمُودٌ, it<br>\
occurs as though meaning The scout, or emissary,<br>\
or perhaps the advanced guard, of an army: but<br>\
in other copies of the K, in this instance, accord.<br>\
to the TA, and in the L, the word is رَئِيس.] ―<br>\

[in the K (in which this explanation is erroneously<br>\

signifies he who stands with the man, (يَقِفُ مَعَهُ,<br>\
Har p. 544,) or he who acts interchangeably, or<br>\
alternates, with the man, (يُرَاسِلُهُ, S,) in a competition in shooting, or in some other performance.<br>\
(S and Har.) And, as also ↓ مُرَاسِلٌ, One who<br>\
relieves, or aids, another, in singing and in work,<br>\
[by alternating with him, i. e.,] in the former<br>\
case, by taking up the strain when the other is<br>\
unable to continue it [so as to accomplish the<br>\
cadence (see 6)], and in the latter case by taking<br>\
up the work when the other is unable to continue<br>\
it; or one who so relieves, or aids, another in<br>\
singing with a high voice; i. q. مُتَالٍ: or one who<br>\
aids another, [or relieves him, by alternating<br>\
with him,] or who follows him, or imitates him,<br>\
in his work. (IAar, Msb.) One says, هُوَ رَسِيلُهُ<br>\
فِى الغِنَآءِ وَنَحْوِهِ [He is the person who relieves<br>\
him, or aids him, by alternating with him, in<br>\

signify the same, (S, M, Msb, K,) A message;<br>\
and a letter; (MA in explanation of the first,<br>\
and KL in explanation of the first and third;)<br>\
[a communication sent from one person or party<br>\
to another, oral or written;] substs. from أَرْسَلَ<br>\

(Msb;) and أَرْسُلٌ is pl. of ↓ رَسُولٌ in the sense of<br>\
رِسَالَةٌ, and of the fem. gender. (TA. [See the<br>\

↓ رَسُولًا: (MA:) see 4. A poet says, (S,) namely<br>\

[Now deliver thou to Aboo-&#39; Amr a message,<br>\
saying that I am in no need of your judging]:<br>\
(S:) or بَنِى عَمْرٍو [the sons of &#39; Amr]: he means,<br>\
عَنْ حُكْمكُمْ. (TA.) And hence the saying of<br>\
Kutheiyir,<br>\
لَقَدْ كَذَبَ الوَاشُونَ مَا بُحْتُ عِنْدَهُمْ<br>\
↓ بِسِرٍّ وَلَا أَرْسَلْتُهُمْ بِرَسُولِ<br>\
[Assuredly the slanderers have lied: I revealed<br>\
not in their presence a secret, nor did I send<br>\
them with a message]: (S, TA:) or, as some<br>\
relate the second hemistich, (TA,)<br>\
↓ بِلَيْلَى وَلَا أَرْسَلْتُهُمْ بِرَسِيلِ<br>\

رُسَيْلَاتٌ dim. of رسلات [i. e. رِسَلَاتٌ] pl. of<br>\
رِسْلٌ [or rather of its syn. رِسْلَةٌ]: hence the saying,<br>\
(TA,) أَلْقَى الكَلَامَ عَلَى رُسَيْلَاتِهِ, i. e. He held the<br>\
saying, or speech, in light, or little, or mean,<br>\
estimation; or in contempt. (M, K, TA.)<br>\

(TA,) is in error: (K:) or the وَابِلَتَانِ [q. v., a<br>\

copies of the K, الرَّابِلَتَانِ is erroneously put for<br>\
الوَابِلَتَانِ. (TA.)<br>\

تابعىّ says, “The Apostle of God (May God<br>\
bless and save him) said,” without mentioning a<br>\
صَحَابِىّ (K, TA) who heard it from the Apostle<br>\
of God: (TA: [and the like is said in the Mgh:])<br>\
مَرَاسِيلُ is the [pl. or] quasi-pl. n. of مُرْسَلٌ thus<br>\
used, [or rather used as a subst., or as an epithet<br>\
in which the quality of a subst. is predominant,]<br>\

-b3-  In lexicology,<br>\
it means, like مُنْقَطِعٌ, (assumed tropical:)  That of which the series<br>\
of transmitters is interrupted: as a word &amp;c.<br>\
handed down by IDrd as on the authority of AZ<br>\

such is not admitted [as unquestionable]; because<br>\
exactness is a condition of the admission of what<br>\
is transmitted, and the exactness of him who is<br>\
not mentioned is not known. (Mz 4th نوع.) ―<br>\

K, TA:) or the horses (M, K, TA) that are<br>\
started, [one following another,] in the racecourse. (TA.)<br>\

(M, K, TA,) but has in her some remains of<br>\
youth: (M, TA:) or whose husband has died, or<br>\

(S, K, * TA) by means of the men who demand<br>\
women in marriage, (TA,) and who has in her<br>\
some remains (K, TA) of youth; but this addition is more properly mentioned in a former explanation. (TA.) The subst. [app. meaning The<br>\

termed] is ↓ رِسَالٌ. (M, TA.)<br>\
مُسْتَرْسِلٌ: see رَسْلٌ.<br>\
