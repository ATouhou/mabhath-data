رَفَقَ, (S, O, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
رَفُقَ, (S, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. رِفْقٌ (S, * O, Mgh, * Msb, * K) and مَرْفِقٌ and<br>\
مِرْفَقٌ (AZ, O, K,) and مَرْفَقٌ; (O, K;) and رَفِقَ,<br>\
(JK, O, K,) [aor.<br>\
رَفَقَ,] inf. n. رَفَقٌ; (JK;) and رَفُقَ;<br>\
(JK, O, K;) He was, or became, gentle, soft,<br>\
tender, gracious, courteous, or civil; or he be<br>\
haved, or acted, gently, softly, &amp;c. (JK, S, O,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K.) You say, رَفَقَ بِهِ, (AZ, S, O,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) and عَلَيْهِ, (AZ, O, K,) inf. ns.<br>\
as above; (O, K;) and رَفِقَ, and رَفُقَ; (K;) He<br>\
was, or became, gentle, &amp;c., or he behaved, or<br>\
acted, gently, &amp;c., with him, (AZ, S, O, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) and to him; (AZ, O, K;) and in like<br>\
manner, بِهِ ↓ ترفّق, (S, O, Mgh, K,) and ↓ ارفقهُ.<br>\
(AZ, O, K.) Hence the saying of the Prophet,<br>\
مَنْ رَفَقَ بِأُمَّتِى رَفَقَ اللّٰهُ بِهِ [He who is gentle, &amp;c.,<br>\
with my people, God will be gentle, &amp;c., with<br>\
him]. (O.) [Hence, also,] one says, ↓ ترفّق<br>\
فِى أَمْرِهِ [and رَفَقَ فِيهِ as is indicated in the O] He<br>\
used gentleness, or acted gently, in his affair;<br>\
syn. تَأَتَّى. (Msb in art. اتى.) And لِحَاجَتِهِ ↓ ترفّق<br>\
He applied himself with gentleness to his needful<br>\
affair or business; syn. تَأَتَّى. (T in art. اتى.)<br>\
And لِلْأَمْرِ ↓ ترفّق He applied himself with gentle<br>\
ness to the affair; syn. تَلَطَّفَ. (S in art. لطف.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, رَفُقَ, in form like فَرُبَ, He was, or<br>\
became, gentle, delicate, nice, neat, or skilful, in<br>\
work or operation; the contr. of such as is termed<br>\
أَخْرَق. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And رَفَقْتُ العَمَلَ, with fet-h<br>\
to the ف, aor.<br>\
رَفُقَ, I did, or made, the deed, or<br>\

-b4-  And رَفَقْتُ فِى السَّيْرِ I pro<br>\
ceeded in a right, or a moderate, manner in<br>\
journeying, or in pace. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 4.<br>\
-A3-<br>\
رَفَاقَةٌ is an inf. n. signifying The being a رَفَيق.<br>\
(O, K.) Fr says, I heard a man at &#39;Arafát<br>\
saying [to the pilgrims there assembled], جَعَلَكُمُ<br>\
اللّٰهٌ فِى رَفَاقَةِ مُحَمَّدٍ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ [May<br>\
God make you to be in the companionship of<br>\
Mohammad: may God bless and save him].<br>\
(O.) [And accord. to the TK, one says, رَفُقَ بِهِ,<br>\
inf. n. رَفَاقَةٌ, meaning He became a رَفِيق with<br>\
him: but what is commonly said in this sense is<br>\
رَافقَهُ, q. v.]<br>\

رَفُقَ, inf. n. رَفْقٌ, (S, O,) He bound<br>\
the she-camel&#39;s arm [app. together with the shank<br>\
(for such is the common practice)], (S, O, K,)<br>\
to prevent her going quickly, (S, O,) when fearing<br>\
her yearning towards, or longing for, her home,<br>\
or accustomed place: (S, O, K:) [or] رَفَقَ البَعِيرَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
رَفِقَ, inf. n. رَفْقٌ, he bound the camel&#39;s neck<br>\
(عُنُق [probably, I think, a mistranscription for<br>\
عَضُد i. e. arm,]) to his pastern, because of a<br>\
slight lameness therein. (JK.)<br>\
-A5-  رَفِقَ said of a<br>\
camel, aor.<br>\
رَفَقَ, inf. n. رَفَقٌ, He had his elbow dis<br>\
torted from his side. (TA and TK. [See رَفَقٌ<br>\
below, and أَرْفَقُ: and see also دَفِقَ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And<br>\
رَفِقَتْ, inf. n.رَفَقٌ, is probably said of a she-camel,<br>\
as meaning She had, in her teat, or teats, what is<br>\
termed رَفَقٌ: see, again, this word below.]<br>\
2<br>\
تَرْفِيقٌ [as the inf. n. of the verb in the phrase<br>\
رُفِّقَتِ الشَّاةُ, if this verb have been used, means A<br>\
sheep&#39;s, or goat&#39;s having the fore legs white to the<br>\
elbows; for it] is from شَاةٌ مُرَفَّقَةٌ, explained below. (O.)<br>\
3<br>\
رافقهُ He was, or became, his رَفِيق, or<br>\
travelling-companion; he accompanied him in a<br>\
journey; (S, O, Msb, K;) inf. n. مُرَافَقَةٌ (TK)<br>\
and رِفَاقٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And this latter inf. n. also<br>\
signifies The being hypocritical, or acting hypocritically. (TA. [See also 3 in art. رمق.])<br>\
4<br>\
ارفقهُ: see 1, second sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He<br>\
profited him, or was useful to him; (S, O, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ رَفَقَهُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And in the present day,<br>\
it means He associated him بِغَيْرِهِ with another or<br>\

5<br>\
تَرَفَّقَ see 1, in four places.<br>\
6<br>\
ترافقوا They were, or became, travellingcompanions; they travelled, or journeyed, together;<br>\

and ترافقنا فِى السَّفَرِ we were, or became, companions in travelling, or journeying. (S, O.)<br>\
8<br>\
ارتفق i. q. طلب رفقا [i. e. طَلَبَ رِفْقًا] and<br>\
استعان [both meaning He sought, or demanded,<br>\
aid, or help]. (Har p. 395. [See also 10.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And hence, (Har ibid.,) ارتفق بِهِ He profited, or<br>\
gained advantage or benefit, by him, or it, (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, TA,) namely, a thing. (Msb.) [This<br>\
phrase is also often used as meaning He made use<br>\
of it; namely, a garment, and an implement, &amp;c.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  See also 6.<br>\
-A2-  Also He leaned upon the مِرْفَق<br>\

-A3-  And<br>\
It was, or became, full, or filled. (K.)<br>\
10<br>\
استرفقهُ He sought, or demanded, his profiting him, or being useful to him. (TA.)<br>\
Q. Q. 2<br>\
تَمَرْفَقَ He took a مِرْفَقَة, i. e. pillow<br>\
[upon which to lean with his elbow]. (S.)<br>\
رِفْقٌ an inf. n. of رَفَقَ; (O, K;) Gentleness,<br>\
softness, tenderness, graciousness, courteousness,<br>\
or civility; contr. of عُنْفٌ; (S, O, Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
i. q. لُطْفٌ, and حُسْنُ صَنِيعٍ, (IDrd, O, K,) or<br>\
لِينُ جَانِبٍ and لَطَافَةُ فِعْلٍ; and so ↓ رَفَقٌ; (JK;)<br>\
and ↓ رَافِقَةٌ likewise; whence the phrase أَوْلَى<br>\
فُلَانًا رَافِقَةً [He treated such a one with gentleness,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (JK, IDrd, O.) It is also explained as<br>\
meaning Good submission to that which conduces<br>\
to what is comely, or pleasing. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
Gentleness, delicacy, nicety, neatness, or skilfulness, in work or operation; contr. of خُرْقٌ.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A thing by means of which one<br>\

رَفَقٌ inf. n. of رَفِقَ: see the next preceding<br>\

-A2-  [Also Easy of attainment.] You<br>\
say مَرْتَعٌ رَفَقٌ [A place of pasturing, or of unrestrained and plentiful pasturing,] easy to be<br>\
sought [and attained]. (S, O.) And مَآءٌ رَفَقٌ<br>\

An object of want that is easy [to be sought and<br>\
attained]. (O, K.)<br>\
-A3-  Also A distortion of the<br>\
elbow of a camel from the side. (Lth, S, O, K.<br>\
[Said to be the inf. n. of رَفِقَ, q. v.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A<br>\
stoppage of the orifice of the teat, (K,) or of the<br>\
orifices of the teats, (O,) of a she-camel: (O, K:)<br>\
so says Zeyd Ibn-Kuthweh: (O:) or a disorder<br>\
in the orifice of the teat, in consequence of being<br>\
badly milked, or of the milker&#39;s not shaking the<br>\
teat to remove what remained in it, so that the<br>\
milk reverts into the udder, and turns to blood,<br>\
or becomes coagulated and mixed with yellow<br>\
water. (K. [Perhaps in this sense, also, an<br>\
inf. n.: see 1, last sentence.])<br>\
-A4-  See also رُفْقَةٌ.<br>\
رَفْقَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
رُفْقَةٌ, (JK, S, O, Mgh, Msb, K,) in the dial. of<br>\
Temeem, (Msb,) and ↓ رِفْقَةٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) in<br>\
the dial. of Keys, (Msb,) and ↓ رَفْقَةٌ, and on the<br>\
authority of Ibn-Tal-hah ↓ رُفَاقَةٌ, (K, [in which this<br>\
last is said to be like ثُمَامَةُ, to indicate that it is<br>\
with damm to the ر, but not (as will be shown<br>\
below, voce رَفِيقٌ,) that it is without tenween,<br>\
imperfectly decl., and determinate like الرُّفْقَةُ,])<br>\
Persons travelling, or journeying, together;<br>\
(Mgh;) a company of persons [travelling, or<br>\
journeying, or] with whom one is travelling, or<br>\
journeying; but not when they have separated:<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K:) or persons with whom one<br>\
travels, or journeys, as long as they are congregated in one place of assembly, and in one<br>\
journey; but not when they have separated:<br>\
(JK:) pl. [of mult.] رِفَاقٌ, (S, O, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
which is pl. of رُفْقَةٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) and رُفَقٌ, [which<br>\
is also pl. of رُفْقَةٌ,] and [of pauc.] أَرْفَاقٌ; (O, K;)<br>\
and the pl. of رِفْقَةٌ is رِفَقٌ: (Msb:) or رُفْقَةٌ is a<br>\
quasi-pl. n. of ↓ رَفِيقٌ, or syn. with this last used<br>\
in a pl. sense; and its pl. is رِفَقٌ and رُفَقٌ and<br>\
[quasi-pl. n.] ↓ رَفَقٌ. (K.) [Golius explains the<br>\
first and second and third, as on the authority of<br>\
the KL, by the words “ consortium, societas: ”<br>\
but in my copy of the KL, I find only the first<br>\
and second; and these are explained only by the<br>\
words گروه همراهان, agreeably with the renderings<br>\
which I have given above.] ―<br>\
-b2-  The pl. رِفَاقٌ also<br>\
signifies Camels upon which people have gone<br>\
forth to purvey for themselves wheat, or corn, or<br>\
other provisions from the towns or villages; each,<br>\
or every, company being termed a رُفْقَة. (TA voce<br>\
رَطَانَةٌ.)<br>\
رِفْقَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
رَفِقَةٌ as an epithet applied to a she-camel: see<br>\
أَرْفَقُ.<br>\
رِفَاقٌ The cord that is used for the purpose<br>\
described in the explanation of رَفَقَ النَّاقَةَ, (S, O,<br>\
K,) or in the explanation of رَفَقَ البَعِيرَ. (JK.)<br>\
[See 1, in the latter part of the paragraph.] So in<br>\
the saying of Bishr, (S,) i. e. of Bishr Ibn-Abee-<br>\
Házim, (O,)<br>\
فَإِنِّى وَالشَّكَاةَ مِنَ الِ لَأْىٍ<br>\
كَذَاتِ الضِغْنِ تَمْشِى فِى الرِّفَاقِ<br>\
(O,) or وَآلَ لَامٍ, (S, O,) accord. to different readings: (O:) [i. e. And verily I, with respect to<br>\
the fault, or the complaint, of the family of Läy,<br>\
or and the family of Lám, am like her that<br>\
yearns towards, or longs for, her home, or accustomed place, going along with her arm and shank<br>\
in the رفاق]: he says, I am withheld from satirizing them, like as this she-camel that yearns<br>\
towards, or longs for, her home, or accustomed<br>\
place, is bound and withheld; but if they do not<br>\
what I approve, I will let loose my tongue with<br>\
satirizing them. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A thing in form<br>\
like a finger, made for the teat of a she-camel<br>\
when she is affected with the [disorder termed]<br>\
رَفَق: it is stuffed with dates, and then the صِرَار<br>\
[q. v.] is bound over it, in order that it [the teat]<br>\
may be cured. (JK.)<br>\
رَفِيقٌ Gentle, soft, tender, gracious, courteous,<br>\
or civil; (JK, Msb;) as also ↓ رَافِقٌ. (JK.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And hence, (Msb,) Gentle, delicate, nice, neat,<br>\
or skilful, in work or operation; contr. of أَخْرَقُ.<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, also,] هٰذَا الأَمْرُ رَفِيقٌ<br>\
بِكَ and بِكَ ↓ رَافِقٌ and رَافِقٌ عَلَيْكَ (assumed tropical:)  [This affair,<br>\
or thing, is easy, or convenient, to thee: see<br>\
أَرْفَقُ]. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A companion (JK, S, O,<br>\
Msb, K) and companions (JK, S, O, K) in travel-ling, or journeying, and afterwards: (Kh, S, O,<br>\
Msb, K:) used as sing. and pl., (JK, S, O, K,)<br>\
like صَدِيقٌ (S, O) and خَلِيطٌ: (O:) pl. رُفَقَآءُ;<br>\
(JK, S, O, K;) with which ↓ رُفَاقَةٌ is syn., as in<br>\
the phrase فِتْيَةٌ رُفَاقَةٌ [Young men companions &amp;c.].<br>\
(JK.) See also رُفْقَةٌ. It is said in the Kur [iv. 71],<br>\
وَحَسُنَ أُولَائِكَ رَفِيقًا, (JK, S, O,) meaning رُفَقَآءَ<br>\
[i. e. And good, or very good, will be those as<br>\
companions after the journey of life] in Paradise!<br>\
(JK.) And Mohammad is related by &#39;Áïsheh to<br>\
have said, [just before his death,] when he had<br>\
been given his choice between continuance in the<br>\
present world and what was with God, and had<br>\
chosen the latter, بَلِ الرَّفِيقَ الأَعْلَى مِنَ الجَنَّةِ<br>\
[Nay, rather, the highest companions of Paradise]; meaning, I desire the company, or congregation, of the prophets. (O.)<br>\
رُفَاقَةٌ: see رُفْقَةٌ and رَفِيقٌ.<br>\
رَافِقٌ: see رَفِيقٌ, in two places.<br>\
رَافِقَةٌ: see رِفْقٌ.<br>\
أَرْفَقُ [compar. and superl. of رَفِيقٌ; meaning<br>\
More, and most, gentle, &amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one<br>\
says, هٰذَا الأَمْرُ أَرْفَقُ بِكَ [and عَلَيْكَ] (assumed tropical:)  This affair,<br>\
or thing, is more, or most, easy, or convenient, to<br>\
thee. (TA in art. عود.) [See also an instance<br>\
voce مَحْنِيَةٌ (in art. حنو), last sentence.]<br>\
-A2-  Also,<br>\
applied to a camel, Having the elbow (المِرْفَق)<br>\
distorted from the side: (JK, S, O, K:) so says<br>\
Lth: (O:) and so the fem. رَفْقَآءُ, applied to a<br>\
she-camel: (JK, S:) but Az says that the epithet<br>\
preserved by him in his memory as heard from<br>\
the Arabs applied to a camel is أَدْفَقُ, with دال.<br>\
(O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to As, (O,) رَفْقَآءُ applied to a<br>\
she-camel signifies Having the orifice of her teat<br>\
stopped up; (O, K;) and so ↓ رَفِقَةٌ: (K:) the<br>\
latter is said by Zeyd Ibn-Kuthweh to signify, so<br>\
applied, having the orifices of her teats stopped<br>\
up. (O.)<br>\
مَرْفَقٌ: see مِرْفَقٌ, in two places.<br>\
مَرْفِقٌ: see what next follows, in three places.<br>\
مِرْفَقٌ and ↓ مَرْفِقٌ inf. ns. of رَفَقَ, (AZ, O, K,) of<br>\
which ↓ مَرْفَقٌ also is an inf. n. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
A thing by which one profits, or gains advantage<br>\
or benefit. (S, O, Msb, K.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[xviii. 15], وَيُهَيِّئُ لَكُمْ مِنْ أَمْرِكُمْ مِرْفَقًا or ↓ مَرْفِقًا,<br>\
accord. to different readers, [i. e. And He will<br>\
prepare for you a condition of your case by<br>\
which ye shall profit], but no one reads ↓ مَرْفَقًا,<br>\
(S, O,) which, however, is allowable, meaning<br>\
↓ رِفْقًا. (S. [See رِفْقٌ, last sentence.]) The pl. is<br>\
مَرَافِقُ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] مَرَافِقُ الدَّارِ Such appertenances [or conveniences] of the house as the<br>\
privy and the kitchen and the like: (Mgh, Msb:)<br>\
or the sinks, and the like, of the house: (S, O, K:)<br>\
and particularly privies: (O:) when used in these<br>\
senses, the sing. is مِرْفَقٌ only, with kesr to the<br>\
م and fet-h to the ف, (Mgh, Msb,) likened to<br>\
the noun signifying an instrument. (Msb.) [See<br>\
also حَيِّزٌ, in art. حوز.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And from the same<br>\
words in the sense expl. in the second sentence<br>\
above, (Msb,) مِرْفَقٌ and ↓ مَرْفِقٌ signify also The<br>\
elbow, or elbow-joint; the place where the ذِرَاع<br>\
joins upon the عَضُد; (S, O, K;) [in other words,]<br>\
the place where the عَضُد is connected with the<br>\
سَاعِد; (Mgh;) the مرفق of a man: (Msb:) [and<br>\
in like manner in a beast, the elbow, or elbowjoint, as in the JK, S, O, and K, voce أَرْفَقُ;<br>\
and in countless other instances: but in the K<br>\
voce رُكْبَةٌ (q. v.), it seems to be applied to the<br>\
knee of a beast:] pl. as above. (Msb.)<br>\
مِرْفَقَةٌ A pillow (S, O, Mgh, K) upon which one<br>\
leans [with the elbow]: from مِرْفَقٌ in the sense<br>\
explained in the last sentence of the next preceding paragraph. (Mgh.)<br>\
شَاةٌ مُرَفَّقَةٌ A sheep, or goat, having the fore<br>\
legs white to the elbows. (O, K.)<br>\
مِرْفَاقٌ A camel whose elbow hurts (يُصِيبُ) his<br>\
side. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A she-camel that is hurt<br>\
by the صِرَار [q. v.] when her udder is bound therewith, and from whom blood issues (JK, O, K)<br>\
when she is loosed [therefrom] (إِذَا حُلَّتْ), (JK,)<br>\
or when she is milked (اذا حُلِبَتْ). (O, K.)<br>\
مَرْفُوقٌ A camel having a complaint of his مِرْفَق<br>\
[or elbow]. (IDrd, O, K.)<br>\
مُرْتَفَقٌ A place, or thing, upon which one leans<br>\
[properly with the مِرْفَق, or elbow]. (Bd in xviii.<br>\
28 and 30.)<br>\
مُرْتَفِقٌ Leaning upon his elbow. (S, O.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also Full, standing, and continuing, or remaining: (O, K:) or nearly full: so explained by<br>\
IAar as occurring in the following verse of &#39;Obeyd<br>\
Ibn-El-Abras, (O,) describing rain that had filled<br>\
the low tracts of ground: (TA in art. صوح:)<br>\
فَأَصْبَحَ الرَّوْضُ وَالقِيعَانُ مُمْرِعَةً<br>\
مِنْ بَيْنِ مُرْتَفِقٍ مِنْهَا وَمُنْصَاحِ<br>\
[And the meadows, and the plain, or soft, low<br>\
tracts, became abundant with herbage, partly by<br>\
what was full, &amp;c., in consequence thereof, and<br>\
partly by what was flowing, running upon the<br>\
surface of the ground]: (O:) or, as some relate<br>\
it, مُتْرَعَةً [i. e. “ filled ”]; and مُرْتَتِقٍ, which means<br>\
herbage “ of which the blossoms have not yet<br>\
come forth from their calyxes; ” and مُنْصَاح<br>\
[accord. to this reading] meaning herbage “ of<br>\
which the blossoms have appeared: ” (TA in art.<br>\
صوح:) [or, accord. to the reading مُرْتَتِقٍ, the<br>\
meaning may be, “partly such as were compact<br>\
thereof,” i. e. of the meadows &amp;c., “and partly<br>\
such as were cracked ” by the heat and drought:]<br>\
another reading is<br>\
مِنْ بَيْنِ مُرْتَفِقٍ مِنْهَا وَمِنْ طَاحِى<br>\
من طاحى meaning “ of what was flowing and<br>\
going away. ” (TA ubi suprà.)<br>\
[Nearly the whole of this art. is wanting in the<br>\
copies of the TA to which I have had access.]<br>\
' } );
