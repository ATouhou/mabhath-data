country, where water stagnates, or remains, or<br>\
collects, at least a hundred cubits in extent: (M:)<br>\
or a tract of sand, and of fresh green herbage,<br>\
where water stagnates, or remains, or collects;<br>\

رياض of the hard and stony and rugged tracts in<br>\
the desert are low level places, in which the rainwater stagnates, or remains, or collects, and<br>\
which consequently produce various kinds of<br>\
herbage, that do not quickly dry up and wither:<br>\
that sometimes a رَوْضَة contains thickets of wild<br>\
سِدْر: and sometimes it is a mile in length and<br>\
breadth: but such as are very wide are termed<br>\
قِيعَان. (TA.) It is said in a prov., أَحْسَنُ مِنْ<br>\
بَيْضَةٍ فِى رَوْضَةٍ [More beautiful than an egg in a<br>\
meadow, or garden]. (A, TA.) And one says,<br>\
أَنَا عِنْدَكَ فِى رَوْضَةٍ (tropical:)  [I, in thy presence, am as<br>\
though I were in a meadow, or garden]: and<br>\
مَجْلِسُكَ رَوْضَةٌ مِنْ رِيَاضِ الجَنَّةِ (tropical:)  [Thy sittingplace is like a meadow, or garden, of the meadows,<br>\
or gardens, of Paradise]. (A, TA.) Mohammad<br>\

between my house, and my pulpit is a رَوْضَة of<br>\
the رِيَاض of Paradise:” meaning, accord. to Th,<br>\
that he who abides in this place is as though he<br>\

half of a فِرْبَة [or water-skin] (S, M, K) of water:<br>\
(S:) and the former, (tropical:)  as much of water as covers<br>\

رِيضَةٌ: see رَوْضَةٌ. [It is implied in the K that<br>\
the former is syn. with the latter in all its senses:<br>\

colts, (K,) or of beasts (دَوَابّ): (M, Msb:) pl.<br>\
رَاضَةٌ and رُوَّاضٌ (S M, K) and رُوَّضٌ. (M.)<br>\
رَيِّضٌ, originally رَيْوِضٌ, (S,) [in its primary<br>\
sense seems to be syn. with ↓ مَرُوضٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
hence it signifies] (assumed tropical:)  Clement, or forbearing.<br>\

(L:) and a she-camel not trained: (A:) or,<br>\
applied to a horse or the like, and to a camel, to<br>\
a male and to a female, refractory; contr. of<br>\
