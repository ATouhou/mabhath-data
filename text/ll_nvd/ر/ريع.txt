رَاعَ, aor. يَرِيعُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. رَيْعٌ (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K) and رُيُوعٌ (TA) and رِيَاعٌ (Lh, TA)<br>\
and رَيَعَانٌ, (TA,) It increased, or augmented; (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) said of wheat and other things:<br>\
or, as some say, it denotes زِيَادَة [i. e. it signifies<br>\
it became redundant, or it exceeded, as will be<br>\
seen in what follows; but the truth is, that it has<br>\
both of these significations; the latter] in relation to flour, and to bread. (TA.) You say,<br>\
رَاعَتِ الحِنْطَةُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. تَرِيعُ, inf. n. رَيْعٌ<br>\
[&amp;c.]; (Msb;) and ↓ أَرَاعَت, (S, K,) which latter<br>\
is said by Az to be more commonly used than the<br>\
former; (TA;) and الطَّعَامُ ↓ رَيَّعَ [which is the<br>\
same as رَيَّعَتِ الحِنْطَةُ]; (TA;) The wheat increased, or augmented; or received increase and<br>\
blessing from God; or throve by the blessing of<br>\
God: (S, Msb, K, TA:) and in like manner one<br>\
says of other things. (Msb.) And رَاعَتِ الشَّجَرَةُ,<br>\
and ↓ اراعت, but the former is rare, The tree<br>\
became abundant in its produce, or fruit. (AHn.)<br>\
And sometimes they said, (S,) الإِبِلُ ↓ اراعت (S,<br>\
IF, K) (tropical:)  The camels had many young ones; (S;)<br>\
they increased, and had many young ones. (IF, K.)<br>\
One says also, رَاعَ الطَّعَامُ, and ↓ اراع, The wheat<br>\
became redundant; or had a part, or portion,<br>\
redundant; [app. meaning, over and above the<br>\
original measure;] in the kneading and the<br>\
making of bread; syn. صَارَ لَهُ زِيَادَةٌ. (S.) [See<br>\
the first sentence above; and see رَيْعٌ, below.]<br>\
And رَاعَ فِى يَدِى كَذَا Such a thing was redundant, or remained over and above, in my<br>\
hand; as also رَاقَ; syn. زَادَ: (L in this art., and<br>\
TA in art. روع:) Sgh has mistranscribed the explanation, زاد, in his two books, [the TS and the<br>\
O,] writing فَادَ; and the author of the K has<br>\
imitated him in mentioning this in art. روع, instead<br>\
of the present art., which is its proper place, but<br>\
has written for the explanation أَفَادَ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
رَاعَ, aor. يَرِيعُ, (IDrd, S, K,) inf. n. رَيْعٌ, (S, TA,)<br>\
He, or it, returned; went, or came, back; reverted: (IDrd, S, K:) and رَاعَ, aor. يَرُوعُ, (IDrd,<br>\
and K in art. روع,) inf. n. رُوَاعٌ, (K in that art.,)<br>\
signifies the same; (IDrd, and K in art. روع;) or<br>\
it returned to its place: (TA in that art.:) but<br>\
the former verb is the more common. (TA in<br>\
the present art.) One says, of camels that have<br>\
run away, صَاحَ عَلَيْهَا الرَّاعِى فَرَاعَتْ إِلَيْهِ [The<br>\
pastor cried out at them, and] they returned to<br>\
him. (TA.) And وَعَظْتُهُ فَأَبِى أَنْ يَرِيعَ [I exhorted him, but he refused] to return, or revert.<br>\
(TA.) And فُلَانٌ مَا يَرِيعُ بِكَلَامِكَ وَلا بِصَوْتِكَ Such<br>\
a one does not return, or revert, by reason of thy<br>\
speech nor by reason of thy voice. (TA.) And<br>\
you say of vomit, رَاعَ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ Somewhat of it<br>\
returned: (S:) and رَاعَ عَلَيْهِ it returned to his<br>\
inside. (TA.) And in like manner one says of<br>\
anything that returns to him, رَاعَ, aor. يَرِيعُ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَاعُوا, They drew, gathered, or collected,<br>\
themselves together; (Ibn- &#39;Abbád, TA;) as also<br>\

so in the saying of El-Kumeyt,<br>\
إِذَا حِيصَ مِنْهُ جَانِبٌ رَاعَ جَانِبٌ<br>\
[When a side thereof is sewed up, a side becomes<br>\
rent]. (S.)<br>\
-A4-  [It is also said that] رَاعَ, aor. يَرِيعُ,<br>\
is like رَدَّ [app. as signifying He returned a reply,<br>\
or an answer, to a person; for it is mentioned immediately after رَيْعٌ as syn. with مَرْجُوعٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
ريّع الطَّعَامُ: see 1; second sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  ريّعوا<br>\

-A2-  ريّعهُ: see 4.<br>\

of the paragraph, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  اراعوا Their<br>\
wheat increased, or augmented; or received increase and blessing from God; or throve by the<br>\
blessing of God: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K:) and in like<br>\
manner, their seed-produce [in general]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اراع الشَّىْءَ He increased, or augmented, the<br>\
thing; or made it to increase, or augment; as<br>\
also ↓ ريّعهُ. (TA.)<br>\

تريّعوا: see 1, near the end of the paragraph.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  تريّع said of grease, or gravy, (TA,) or oil,<br>\
(S,) and of clarified butter, when much thereof has<br>\
been put into food; (S, TA;) or of melted grease<br>\
in a bowl; (A, TA;) or of clarified butter upon<br>\
a cake of bread; (ISh, TA;) It flowed, or ran,<br>\
hither and thither, having no direct course; (S,<br>\
TA;) or went to and fro; (A, TA;) or portions<br>\
thereof followed a little after other portions:<br>\
(ISh, TA:) and, said of water, it ran, or flowed.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  In like manner, (S,) said of the mirage<br>\
(سَرَاب), [It quivered, vibrated, or moved to and<br>\
fro;] it came and went; (S, K;) as also تَرَيَّهَ:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ رَاعَ, aor. يَرِيعُ, (TA,) inf. n. رَيْعٌ<br>\
(K, TA) and رَيَعَانٌ, (TA,) said of the same, it was,<br>\

quivered, vibrated, or moved to and fro. (K, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  He became confounded, or perplexed, [as<br>\
though vacillating, or wavering,] and unable to see<br>\
his right course; as also ↓ استراع. (Ibn- &#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\

-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  He paused; or waited: (O, L, K:) or (so<br>\
in the L, but in the O and K “ and ”) he paused;<br>\
or hesitated; or held, refrained, or abstained.<br>\
(O, L, K.) [See the part. n., below.] ―<br>\
-b6-  تَرَيَّعَتْ<br>\
يَدَاهُ بِالجُودِ (tropical:)  His two hands overflowed with<br>\
bounty, [as though they went hither and thither,]<br>\
for one cause after another. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَرْيَعَ see 5.<br>\
رَيْعٌ [see 1, of which it is an inf. n.] Increase;<br>\
syn. زِيَادَةٌ [which may be meant to include the<br>\
third of the significations here following]; as in<br>\
the saying, هٰذَا طَعَامٌ كَثِيرُ الرَّيْعِ [This is wheat of<br>\
much increase]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  Revenue arising<br>\
from the increase of land: because it is an augmentation. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  Milk; as in the phrase,<br>\

or portion, redundant; a surplus; or a residue;<br>\
syn. فَضْلٌ; of anything; as of flour, or meal,<br>\
(Msb, K,) over and above the measure of the<br>\
wheat; (Msb;) and of dough [when it has risen];<br>\
and of seed for sowing [when it has been sown];<br>\
and the like. (K.) Hence it is said, in a trad. of<br>\
I&#39;Ab, respecting the expiation of an oath, لِكُلِّ<br>\
مِسْكِينٍ مُدٌّ مِنْ حِنْطَةٍ رَيْعُهُ إِدَامُهُ [To every poor<br>\
man, a mudd of wheat: the redundance, or redundant part or portion, thereof shall be for its<br>\
seasoning]: i. e., it is not necessary for the person<br>\
to give, with the mudd, seasoning; but the redundance that shall arise, of the flour, or meal,<br>\
of the mudd [of wheat], when he shall have<br>\
ground it, therewith shall the seasoning be bought.<br>\
(TA.) Hence also, the trad. of &#39;Omar, اِمْلِكُوا<br>\
العَجِينَ فَإِنَّهُ أَحَدُ الرَّيْعَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  Knead ye well, or<br>\
thoroughly, or soundly, the dough; for this action<br>\

mail, (S, A, K, TA,) over [and beyond] the ends<br>\
of the fingers; (TA;) and of the skirt thereof.<br>\
(A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also رِيعٌ. ―<br>\

sense,] (S, K,) (tropical:)  The first (S, K) and most excel-lent (K) part of anything: (S, K:) said in the<br>\
B to be a metaphorical application from رَيْعٌ as<br>\
signifying a high, or an elevated, place. (TA.)<br>\
Hence, (S, TA,) رَيْعُ الشَّبَابِ, by poetic license<br>\
written ↓ رَيَع, (TA,) or الشَّبَابِ ↓ رَيْعَانُ, (S, A, L,<br>\
TA,) (tropical:)  The first, or prime, (S, A, TA,) and most<br>\
excellent, (A, TA,) part, or period, of youth or<br>\

this is from رَيْعٌ in relation to wheat: (A, TA:)<br>\
or from المَطَرِ ↓ رَيْعَانُ (assumed tropical:)  the first of rain. (L,<br>\
TA.) Hence also, (S,) السَّرَابِ ↓ رَيْعَانُ (S, Sgh,<br>\
L) (assumed tropical:)  The first of the mirage; (S, Sgh;) what<br>\
comes and goes thereof; (Sgh;) or such as is in<br>\

also,] رَيْعُ الضُّحَى (tropical:)  The whiteness, and beautiful<br>\
splendour, of the first part of the day after sunrise. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  نَاقَةٌ لَهَا رَيْعٌ (tropical:)  A she-camel having<br>\
one pace, or rate of going, [app. a quicker pace,]<br>\
after another. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  فُلَانٌ لَيْسَ لَهُ رَيْعٌ i. e.<br>\
مَرْجُوعٌ [app. meaning Such a one has no reply,<br>\

there is no reply, or answer, to be given]. (K, *<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Fright, or fear; (K;) like<br>\
رَوْعٌ. (TA.)<br>\
رِيعٌ (Fr, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ رَيْعٌ, (Fr, K,)<br>\
the former occurring, (S,) or the latter accord. to<br>\
one reading, (TA,) in the Kur [xxvi. 128], (S,<br>\
TA,) High, or elevated, land or ground: (S, K:)<br>\
or a high, or an elevated, place; (so in some<br>\
copies of the S and in the Msb;) which latter<br>\
signification is also assigned to ↓ رِيعَةٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and whence the phrase, كَمْ رِيعُ أَرْضِكَ, meaning<br>\
what is the elevation of thy land? [a phrase not<br>\
to be mistaken for كَمْ رَيْعُ أَرْضِكَ, in which the<br>\
meaning is “ increase: ”] (Az, TA:) or any [road<br>\
such as is termed] فَجّ: (K:) or (so accord. to the<br>\

the first paragraph of art. سمت:]) or a road<br>\
opening so as to form a gap in a mountain;<br>\
(Zj, K;) or, as in some copies of the K, from a<br>\
mountain; but the former is what is termed فَجٌّ,<br>\
before mentioned: (TA:) or a mountain; (S,<br>\
Msb;) so accord. to &#39;Omárah: (S:) or, as in<br>\
some copies of the S, a small mountain: (TA:)<br>\
or signifying also a high mountain: (O, K:)<br>\
n. of un. with ة [i. e. ↓ رِيعَةٌ, as it is written in the<br>\
S; and ↓ رَيْعَةٌ also, as implied in the K]: (S, K:<br>\
[in the former immediately following the signification of “ mountain; ” and in the latter, so following that of “ high mountain; ” whence it seems<br>\
that رِيعٌ and رَيْعٌ are sometimes used, at least in<br>\
one sense, as coll. gen. ns.:]) pl. [of mult.] رِيَاعٌ,<br>\
(S, TA,) which is extr., (TA,) and رُيُوعٌ, and [of<br>\
pauc.] أَرْيَاعٌ: (TA:) but AO says, contr. to J,<br>\
that ↓ رِيعَةٌ is pl. of رِيعٌ: (IB, TA:) or رِيعٌ and<br>\
رَيْعٌ signify the channel of the torrent of a valley<br>\
from any, or every, high, or elevated, place. (K.)<br>\
Also the former, A high mound, or heap of sand,<br>\

to the present art., it is said in the TA to belong.]<br>\
تَرِيعٌ A register in which is written the رَيْع<br>\
[i. e. increase, or revenue arising from the increase,<br>\
of the lands] of districts: the ت being augmentative: but it is a post-classical word. (TA.)<br>\

of pasturing and returns by herself; (K;) or<br>\
such is termed مِسْيَاعٌ مِرْيَاعٌ: (S, TA:) or upon<br>\

sense. (Jm, TA.)<br>\
مُتَرَيِّعٌ (tropical:)  A slippery man, who anoints himself<br>\
with oils. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.) ―<br>\
