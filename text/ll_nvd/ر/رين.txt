رَانَ, [aor. يَرِينُ,] inf. n. رَيْنٌ, [in its primary<br>\
acceptation, app. signifies It was, or became, rusty,<br>\
or covered with rust. And hence,] It (a garment,<br>\
or piece of cloth,) was, or became, dirty, or filthy;<br>\
syn. تَطَبَّعَ. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence also,] رانت<br>\
نَفْسَهُ, (S, M, K, *) aor. تَرِينُ, inf. n. as above, (S,)<br>\
His soul [or stomach] became heavy; or heaved,<br>\
or became agitated by a tendency to vomit; syn.<br>\
غَثَتْ, (S, M, K,) and خَبُثَتْ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And ران<br>\
عَلَيْهِ, (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. and<br>\
inf. n. as above, (Msb,) It (anything) covered it;<br>\
namely, a thing: (M:) or it (anything) overcame<br>\
him; (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, * Mgh, Msb, K;) as<br>\
also ران بِهِ; (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, Mgh, K;) and رَانَهُ.<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, S, Mgh, K.) [And رَانَ with يَرُونُ for<br>\
its aor. signifies the same; as will be seen from a<br>\
verse cited below.] You say of a sin, misdeed, or<br>\
transgression, (ذَنْب,) ران عَلَى قَلْبِهِ, (Zj, T, S,<br>\
Mgh, K,) aor. as above, (Zj, T, S,) inf. n. رَيْنٌ<br>\
(Zj, T, S, M, K) and رُيُونٌ, (S, M, K,) It covered<br>\
his heart: (Zj, T, M:) or it overcame his heart.<br>\
(S, Mgh, K.) رَانَ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ مَا كَانُوا يَكْسِبوُنَ,<br>\
in the Kur [lxxxiii. 14], means [What they used<br>\
to do] hath become like rust upon the clearness of<br>\
their hearts, so as to make the knowledge of good<br>\
from evil to be obscured to them: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) or hath covered their hearts: (Zj, T:) or<br>\
hath overcome their hearts: [or hath spread a<br>\
blackness upon their hearts; for,] accord. to<br>\
El-Hasan, it means that sin has followed upon<br>\
sin so that the heart has become black: (S:) and<br>\
accord. to Aboo-Mo&#39;adh the Grammarian, and a<br>\
saying of the Prophet, الرَّيْنُ means the heart&#39;s<br>\
becoming black in consequence of sins. (T.) You<br>\
say also, رِينَ عَلى قَلْبِهِ His heart became covered<br>\
[&amp;c.]. (M.) And رِينَ بِهِ He was overcome:<br>\
(T, Mgh:) or his property was beset by debt:<br>\
(T:) or he fell into grief, by reason of debt:<br>\
(M:) or he fell into that from which he could not<br>\
escape, (AZ, T, S, Mgh, K,) and with which he<br>\
had not power to cope: (AZ, T, S:) or i. q.<br>\
اُنْقُطِعَ بِهِ [i. e. he became disabled from prosecuting his journey, his means having failed him,<br>\
or his beast breaking down with him or perishing]; (T, S, M;) so says El-Kanánee El-Aarábee:<br>\
(T, S:) and he died. (M.) And رَانَتْ بِهِ الخَمْرُ,<br>\
(T,) or رانت عَلَيْهِ الخَمْرُ, (S, M, [in one copy of<br>\
the S الحُمَّى,]) The wine overcame him; (S, M;)<br>\
and overwhelmed him: (M:) or overcame his<br>\
heart and his reason: (T:) and in like manner<br>\
one says of drowsiness, and of anxiety; by way<br>\
of comparison. (M.) And ران النُّعَاسُ فِى العَيْنِ<br>\
Drowsiness overcame the eye: (S, TA: *) or infected, or pervaded, the eye. (Msb.) Et-Tirimmáh<br>\
says,<br>\
مَخَافَةَ أَنْ يَرُونَ النَّوْمُ فِيهِمْ<br>\
بِسُكْرِ سِنَاتِهِمْ كُلَّ الرُّيُونِ<br>\
[In fear that sleep might overcome them, by reason<br>\
of the intoxication of their sensations of drowsiness, with every degree of overcoming]. (TA.<br>\
[This, together with a signification assigned to<br>\
مَرُونَ in art. رون in the K, shows that رَانَ signifying “ he, or it, overcame,” &amp;c., has يَرُونَ as<br>\
well as يَرِينُ for its aor.]) And you say also,<br>\
ران عَلَيْهِ المَوْتُ, and ران بِهِ, Death took him<br>\
away. (M.)<br>\
4<br>\
ارانوا Their cattle perished, or died: (ElUmawee, T, S, M, K:) and (so in the T, but in<br>\
the M “ or ”) their cattle became lean, or emaciated. (El-Umawee, T, M.) This also, says<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd, is from an event that has happened to<br>\
them and overcome them, and which they have<br>\
not been able to bear. (T.)<br>\
رَانٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  Also [A kind<br>\
of legging;] a thing like a خُفّ [or boot], but<br>\
longer, and without a foot: (K:) described by<br>\
the author of the Msb, in his handwriting upon<br>\
the margin, as a piece of cloth made like the<br>\
خُفّ, stuffed with cotton, worn beneath it on<br>\
account of the cold: not a genuine Arabic word:<br>\
(MF:) it is a Persian word, arabicized. (TA.)<br>\
رَيْنٌ, originally an inf. n.: (Msb:) Rust that<br>\
overspreads the sword and the mirror; (M;)<br>\
rust that overspreads a polished thing: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or much dirtiness from rust: or<br>\
simply dirt, filth, soil, or pollution: syn. طَبَعٌ<br>\
and ذَنَسٌ: (S, K: [in a copy of the S, and in the<br>\
CK, الطَّبْعُ is erroneously put for الطَّبَعُ:]) or a<br>\
cover, or covering. (Msb.) [And hence,] The<br>\
like of rust, covering the heart: (Zj, T:) black-<br>\
ness of the heart: pl. رِيَانٌ. (T.) And ↓ رَانٌ<br>\
signifies the same as رَيْنٌ. (TA.)<br>\
رَيْنَةٌ i. q. خَمْرَةٌ [i. e. Wine, or some wine, or a<br>\
kind of wine]: pl. رَيْنَاتٌ: (IAar, Th, T, K:) so<br>\
called because it overcomes the reason. (TA.)<br>\
رَجُلٌ مَرِينٌ عَلَيْهِ A man beset, or encompassed.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُرِينُونَ Persons whose cattle have perished, or<br>\
died: (El-Umawee, T, S, K:) and whose cattle<br>\
have become lean, or emaciated. (El-Umawee, T.)<br>\
