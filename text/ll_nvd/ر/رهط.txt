8<br>\
نَحْنُ ذَوُو ارْتِهَاطٍ We are collected together,<br>\
or congregated; as also ↓ نَحْنُ ذَوُو رَهْطٍ: (K,<br>\
TA:) [the last word in each of these phrases<br>\
being an inf. n.; unless that in the latter be a<br>\
mistake for أَرْهُطٍ, (a pl. of رَهْطٌ,) which I find put<br>\
in the place of رَهْطٍ in a MS. copy of the K:]<br>\
from Ibn-&#39;Abbád. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In a trad. occurs<br>\
the phrase, فَأَيْقَظَنَا وَنَحْنُ ارْتِهَاطٌ [And he waked<br>\
us,] we being parties collected together, or congregated: the last word being an inf. n. put in<br>\
the place of the verb [or rather of the part. n., or<br>\
for ذَوُو ارَتِهَاطٍ]. (TA.)<br>\
رَهْطٌ (Lth, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ رَهَطٌ, (Lth,<br>\
Msb, K,) but the former is the more chaste, (Lth,<br>\
Msb,) A man&#39;s people, and tribe, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
consisting of his nearer relations: (Msb:) [i. e.<br>\
his near kinsfolk:] and a number of men less<br>\

Msb, K;) as also نَفَرٌ: (AZ, Msb:) or from seven<br>\
to ten; (IDrd, Msb, K;) and sometimes a little<br>\
more; (IDrd;) less than seven, to three, being<br>\
called نَفَرٌ: (Msb:) or from three to ten: (K:)<br>\
or i. q. عَشِيرَةٌ: (ISk, Msb:) or more than ten, to<br>\
forty: (As, IF, Msb:) a pl., (S, Msb,) or a<br>\

of رهط is أَرْهُطٌ (Lth, S, K) and أَرْهِطَةٌ (Lth) and<br>\
أَرْهَاطٌ, (S, K,) [all pls. of pauc.,] the last of these<br>\
being pl. either of رَهَطٌ or of رَهْطٌ, (TA,) and<br>\
أَرَاهِطُ, (S, ISd, K,) as though pl. of أَرْهُطٌ, (S,<br>\
ISd,) though Sb makes it pl. of رَهْطٌ, because of<br>\
the rareness of the pl. pl., (ISd,) and أَرَاهِيطُ<br>\
[which is app. pl. of أَرْهَاطٌ]. (S, K.) You say,<br>\
هُمْ رَهْطُهُ دِنْيَةً They are his people, and his tribe,<br>\
closely related. (S, TA.) And it is said in the<br>\
Kur [xxvii. 49], وَكَانَ قِى المَدِينَةِ تِسْعَةُ رَهْطٍ, (S,)<br>\
but this means, [And there were in the city] nine<br>\
persons, (Bd,) or nine men. (Jel.) ―<br>\
