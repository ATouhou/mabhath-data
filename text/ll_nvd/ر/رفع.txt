رَفَعَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
رَفَعَ, (K, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
رَفْعٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) He raised it: [this is generally the best rendering, as it serves to indicate<br>\
several particular significations which will be<br>\
found explained in what follows:] he elevated it;<br>\
upraised it; uplifted it: he took it up: contr. of<br>\
خَفَضَهُ: (Msb:) or of وَضَعَهُ: (S, Mgh, K:) as<br>\
also ↓ رفّعهُ, (K,) inf. n. تَرْفِيعٌ; (TA;) and ↓ ارتفعهُ;<br>\
(K;) for accord. to the “ Nawádir,” you say,<br>\
ارتفعهُ بِيَدِهِ and رَفَعَهُ [he raised it, lifted it, heaved<br>\
it, or took it up, with his hand]; but Az says<br>\
that ارتفع is intrans., and that he has heard no<br>\
authority for its being trans., in the sense of رَفَعَ,<br>\
except that which he had read in the “ Nawádir<br>\
el-Aaráb:” (TA:) رَفْعٌ is sometimes applied to<br>\
corporeal things, meaning the raising, or elevating,<br>\
a thing from the resting-place thereof: sometimes<br>\
to a building, meaning the rearing it, uprearing<br>\
it, or making it high or lofty: (Er-Rághib:) or<br>\
in relation to corporeal things, it is used properly<br>\
to denote motion, and removal: (Msb:) it signifies the putting away or removing or turning back<br>\
a thing after the coming or arriving thereof; like<br>\
as دَفْعٌ signifies the putting away or removing<br>\
or turning back a thing before the coming or<br>\
arriving [thereof]: (Kull p. 185:) but in relation<br>\
to ideal things, it is [tropically used, as it is also<br>\
in many other cases, and] accorded in meaning to<br>\
what the case requires. (Msb.) [In its principal<br>\
senses, proper and tropical, رَفْعٌ agrees with the<br>\
Latin Tollere..] It is said in the Kur [ii. 60 and<br>\
87], رَفَعْنَا فَوْقَكُمُ الطُّورَ We raised above you from<br>\
its resting-place the mountain: and in the same<br>\
[xii. 2], اَللّٰهُ الَّذِى رَفَعَ السَّمٰوَاتِ بِغَيْرِ عَمَدٍ تَرَوْنَهَا<br>\
[God is He who raised the heavens without<br>\
pillars that ye see; or, as ye see them]: and in<br>\
the same [ii. 121], وَإِذْ يَرْفَعُ إِبْرٰهِيمُ القَوَاعِدَ مِنَ<br>\
البَيْتِ [And when Abraham] was rearing or uprearing or making high or lofty [the foundations<br>\
of the House of God, at Mekkeh]. (Er-Rághib.)<br>\
And you say, اِرْفَعْ هٰذَا Take thou this: (Mgh:)<br>\
or take it and carry it [away; or take it up and<br>\
remove it]. (TA.) And رَفَعَ الزَّرعَ, (Lh, K,) or<br>\
رَفَعَهُ إِلَى البَيْدَرِ, (Msb,) aor.<br>\
رَفَعَ, (Lh,) inf. n. رَفْعٌ<br>\
(Lh, S) and رِفَاعَةٌ and رِفَاعٌ [perhaps a mistranscription for رَفَاعُ, which see below], (Lh, TA,)<br>\
He removed, or transported, the seed-produce<br>\
from the place in which he had reaped it, (Lh,)<br>\
or carried it after the reaping, (S, K,) to the<br>\
place in which the grain was to be trodden out.<br>\
(Lh, S, K.) [This last signification is said in the<br>\
TA to be tropical; but according to a passage of<br>\
the Msb quoted in the first sentence of this art.,<br>\
it is proper. In most of the phrases here following, the verb is undoubtedly used tropically.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
رَفَعُوا إِلَىَّ عُيُونَهُمْ (tropical:)  [They raised towards me their<br>\
eyes]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  دَخَلْتُ عَلَى فُلَانٍ فَلَمْ يَرْفَعْ بِى<br>\
رَأْسًا (Mgh, TA *) (tropical:)  I went in to such a one, and<br>\
he did not look towards me, nor pay any regard,<br>\
or attention, to me. (Mgh.) [بِى is not here a<br>\
mistake for لِى, for the phrase is often found thus<br>\
written.] ―<br>\
-b4-  رُفِعَ لِىَ الشَّىْءُ (assumed tropical:)  [The thing was, as<br>\
it were, raised into view, i. e. it rose into view, to<br>\
me;] I saw the thing from afar. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
رَفَعَ السَّرَابُ الشَّخْصَ, aor.<br>\
رَفَعَ, inf. n. رَفْعٌ, (tropical:)  The<br>\
mirage raised, or elevated [to the eye, (see an ex.<br>\
near the end of the first paragraph of art. زول)]<br>\
the figure of a man or some other thing seen from<br>\
a distance; [or it may be allowable to render it,<br>\
made it to appear tall, and as though quivering,<br>\
vibrating, or playing up and down;] syn. زَهَاهُ<br>\
[of which, when it relates to the mirage, the<br>\
meaning is best expressed by the latter of the two<br>\
explanations here given]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  وَرَفَعْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ<br>\
فَوْقَ بَعْضٍ دَرَجَاتٍ, in the Kur [xliii. 31], means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  And we have exalted some of them above others<br>\
in degrees of rank, or station: and نَرْفَعُ دَرَجَاتٍ<br>\
مَنْ نَشَآءُ, in the same, [vi. 83, and xii. 76,] (assumed tropical:)  We<br>\
exalt in degrees of rank, or station, whom We<br>\
please: (Er-Rághib:) and وَاللّٰهُ يَرْفَعُ مَنْ يَشَآءُ<br>\
وَيَخْفِضُ (assumed tropical:)  And God exalteth whom He pleaseth,<br>\
and abaseth: (S and TA:) and [in like manner,]<br>\
رَفْعُ الذِّكْرِ means the exalting of one&#39;s fame;<br>\
as in the Kur xciv. 4. (Er-Rághib.) But the<br>\
words, وَإِلَى السَّمَآءِ كَيْفَ رُفِعَتْ, in the Kur<br>\
[lxxxviii. 18], indicate two meanings; And to the<br>\
heaven, how it is elevated in respect of its place;<br>\
and (assumed tropical:)  how it is exalted in respect of excellence,<br>\
and exaltation of rank. (Er-Rághib.) [In like<br>\
manner also,] فِى بُيُوتٍ أَذِنَ اللّٰهُ أَنْ تُرْفَعَ, in the<br>\
Kur [xxiv. 36], means In houses which God hath<br>\
permitted to be built; (Bd, TA;) accord. to<br>\
some: (TA:) or, (assumed tropical:)  to be honoured; (Zj, Bd;) so<br>\
says El-Hasan; (Zj;) or, (assumed tropical:)  to be exalted in estimation. (Er-Rághib.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّ<br>\
اللّٰهَ يَرْفَعُ العَدْلَ وَيَخْفِضُهُ (assumed tropical:)  Verily God exalteth<br>\
the just, and maketh him to have the ascendency<br>\
over the unjust, and at one time abaseth him, so<br>\
that He maketh the unjust to overcome him, in<br>\
order to try his creatures, in the present world.<br>\
(Az, TA.) [See also art. خفض.] And you say,<br>\
رَفَعَهُ عَلَى صَاحِبِهِ فِى المَجْلِسِ (assumed tropical:)  He advanced him<br>\
above his companion [in the sitting-place, or<br>\
sitting-room, or assembly]. (TA.) And رَفَعْتُكَ عَنْ<br>\
كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  [I exalted thee, or held thee, above such a<br>\
thing]: (M voce رَبَأَ:) and إِنِّى لَأَرْفَعْكَ عَنْ هٰذَا<br>\
الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily I exalt thee, or hold thee, above<br>\
this thing]. (S voce رَبَأَ, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b7-  رَفَعَ اللّٰهُ عَمَلَهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [God honoured his work by acceptance; or] God<br>\
accepted his work. (Msb.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[xxxv. 11], وَالْعَمَلُ الصَّالِحُ يَرْفَعُهُ (assumed tropical:)  And righteous<br>\
work He will accept: (Jel:) or the meaning is<br>\
يَرْفَعُ العَمَلُ الصَّالِحُ الكَلِمَ الطَّيَّبَ (assumed tropical:)  [righteous work<br>\
will cause praise, or the like, (mentioned immediately before the above-cited words of the Kur,)<br>\
to ascend, and obtain acceptance]: (Mujáhid,<br>\
TA:) Katádeh says, [that the meaning is,] speech<br>\
will not be accepted without work. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
رَفْعٌ Also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The bringing a thing near;<br>\
or presenting, or offering, it; syn. تَقْرِيبٌ. (S.)<br>\
And hence, رَفَعْتُهُ إِلَى السُّلْطَانِ, (S, Mgh, K,) and<br>\
إِلَى الحَكَمِ, (TA,) inf. n. رَفْعٌ (S, * TA) and رُفْعَانٌ<br>\
(S, K) and رِفْعَانٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  I presented him to, or<br>\
brought him before, or brought him forward to,<br>\
the Sultán, (S, * Mgh, * K, * TA,) and the judge,<br>\
to arraign him and contest with him: (TA:) and<br>\
إِلَى الحَاكِمِ ↓ رَافَعَهُ, (S K,) inf. n. مُرَافَعَةٌ, (TA,)<br>\
[in like manner] signifies (tropical:)  he preferred a complaint against him to the governor, or judge: (K:)<br>\
or (tropical:)  he presented him to, or brought him before,<br>\
or brought him forward to, the governor, or<br>\
judge, to arraign him and contest with him, and<br>\
preferred a complaint against him: (TA:) [or it<br>\
denotes the doing so mutually; for, accord. to<br>\
Mtr,] خَصْمَهُ إِلَى السُّلْطَانِ ↓ رَافَعَ signifies (tropical:)  he<br>\
brought his adversary before the Sultán (قَرَّبَهُ<br>\
إِلَيْهِ), the latter doing the same with him. (Mgh.)<br>\
[See also 2.] ―<br>\
-b9-  رَفَعَ القُرْآنَ عَلَى السُّلْطَانِ (tropical:)  [He<br>\
adduced, or brought forward, the Kur-án against<br>\
the Sultán;] he interpreted the Kur-án against<br>\
the Sultán, and judged thereby that he should<br>\
rebel against him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  رَفْعْتُ الرَّجُلَ also<br>\
signifies (tropical:)  I traced up the man&#39;s lineage to his<br>\
greatest ancestor; or I mentioned his lineage, saying, He is such a one the son of such a one, or<br>\
He is of such a tribe, or city, &amp;c.; syn. نَمَيْتُهُ,<br>\
and نَسَبْتُهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  And hence, رَفَعَ الحَدِيثَ<br>\
إِلَى النَّبِىِّ (tropical:)  [He traced up, or ascribed, or attributed, the tradition to the Prophet, mentioning,<br>\
in ascending order, the persons by whom it had<br>\
been handed down, up to the Prophet; in the<br>\
manner more fully explained in the sentence<br>\
here next following]. (TA.) You say also, رَفَعَ<br>\
الحَدِيثَ إِلَى قَائِلِهِ, meaning أَسْنَدَهُ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
traced up, or ascribed, or attributed, the tradition to the author thereof, by mentioning him,<br>\
or by mentioning, uninterruptedly, in ascending<br>\
order, the persons by whom it had been transmitted, up to the Prophet; or by mentioning the<br>\
person who had related it to him from the Prophet if only one person intervened, saying, “Such<br>\
a one told me, from such a one,” (and so on if<br>\
more than one intervened between him and the<br>\
Prophet,) “ from the Apostle of God; ” or with<br>\
an interruption in the mention of the persons by<br>\
whom it had been transmitted]. (S * and Msb in<br>\
art. سند.) [And hence what next follows.] It is<br>\
said in a trad., رَفَعَتْ إِلَيْنَا مِنَ البَلَاغِ ↓ كُلُّ رَافِعَةٍ<br>\
فَقَدْ حَرَّمْتُهَا أَنْ تُعْضَدَ أَوْتُخْبَطَ, (S, * TA, [in a very<br>\
old and excellent copy of the former of which I<br>\
find, as above, إِلَيْنَا, and so in some copies of the<br>\
K and in the O and TA in art. بلغ; but in one<br>\
copy of the S and in the TA in the present art.,<br>\
I find in its place عَلَيْنَا, and so in the CK in art.<br>\
بلغ, where the verb preceding it is erroneously<br>\
written رُفِعَتْ; and in the L, in the place of الينا<br>\
is put عَنَّا; of all which three readings I prefer<br>\
the first; though the last is agreeable with an<br>\
explanation of رَفَعْتُهُ given in the Msb and in the<br>\
sentence next following;]) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Every company<br>\
of men (جَمَاعَة, S, TA), or person (نَفْس, TA),<br>\
that communicates, or announces, from us, (S,<br>\
TA,) and makes known, [lit. traces up to us,]<br>\
what we say, (TA,) [or rather, aught of what is<br>\
communicated, or announced,] or [aught] of what<br>\
is communicated, or announced, of the Kur-án<br>\
and of the [statutes, or ordinances, &amp;c., termed]<br>\
سُنَن, (K in art. بلغ,) or the meaning is مِنْ ذَوِى<br>\
البَلَاغِ, i. e., التَّبْلِيغِ, [of those who have the office<br>\
of communicating, or announcing,] the simple<br>\
subst. being put in the place of the inf. n., (T, O,<br>\
K, TA, all in art. بلغ,) let that company, or<br>\
person, communicate, or announce, and relate,<br>\
that I have forbidden [its trees&#39; being lopped, or<br>\
being beaten with a stick in order that their leaves<br>\
may fall off,] referring to El-Medeeneh: (S, * TA:)<br>\
but some relate it differently, saying, مِنَ البُلَّاغِ<br>\
[of the communicaters, or announcers,] like حُدَّاث<br>\
in the sense of مُحَدِّثُون: (TA:) and some say,<br>\
مِنَ البِلَاغِ, meaning من المُبَالِغِينَ فِى التَّبْلِيغِ, i. e.<br>\
of those who do their utmost in communicating,<br>\
or announcing. (Hr, and K in art. بلغ.) ―<br>\
-b12-<br>\

(Msb.) You say, رَفَعَ عَلَيْهِ كَلَامًا (assumed tropical:)  [He told, or<br>\

[or submitted, or referred, by way of appeal,] the<br>\
affair, or matter, to the Sultán. (Msb.) [See<br>\

لَهَا (tropical:)  [An object to be reached, or accomplished,<br>\
was proposed to him, and he aspired to it].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b14-  رَفَعَ البَعِيرَ, (Sb, K,) and النَّاقَةَ,<br>\
(TA,) or رَفَعَ النَّاقَةَ فِى السَّيْرِ, and الدَّابَّةَ, (M in<br>\
art. نص,) inf. n. رَفْعٌ, (TA in that art.,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
made the camel, (S, Msb, K,) and the she-camel,<br>\
(TA,) and the beast, (M ubi suprà,) to exert<br>\
himself, or herself, to the full, or to the utmost,<br>\
or beyond measure, in going, or pace; (S, K,<br>\
TA;) or to go quickly; (Msb;) or to go with<br>\
the utmost celerity: (TA in art. نص:) or constrained him, or her, to go the pace termed مَرْفُوع<br>\
[q. v. infrà], (TA,) which is an inf. n. of the<br>\
intrans. verb رَفَعَ [q. v. infrà] said of a camel<br>\
(S, TA) and of a beast: (TA:) and ↓ رفّعهُ, (S,<br>\
TA,) [and رفّعها,] and رفّع مِنْهُ, (TA,) [and مِنْهَا,]<br>\
inf. n. تَرْفِيعٌ, signify the same: (S, TA:) or the<br>\
phrase used by the Arabs is اِرْفَعْ مِنْ دَابَّتِكَ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Make thou thy beast to exert itself, &amp;c.]. (L,<br>\
TA.) [You say also, app. in like manner, رَفَعَتْنِى<br>\
أَرْضٌ: or in this case the verb may have a different meaning: see an ex. in the first paragraph<br>\
of art. خفض.] ―<br>\
-b15-  [Hence,] رَفَعْتُهُ إِلَى حَدِّ مَا عِنْدَهُ<br>\
مِنَ العِلْمِ (assumed tropical:)  [I urged him to tell the utmost of<br>\
what he knew;] (A in art. نص;) i. e. I went to<br>\

ضَرْعِهَا (tropical:)  [She (a camel) drew up, &amp; c., or refused to<br>\
yield, the biestings in her udder]. (As, S, K.) ―<br>\

or stick, from his shoulder, or from his wife,] is<br>\
an allusion to discipline, chastisement, or punishment, (Mgh, TA,) or to severity thereof, (Msb,)<br>\
and to beating (Mgh, TA) of women; (Mgh;)<br>\
not meaning that the staff, or stick, is on the<br>\
shoulder: (Msb:) or the first is an allusion to<br>\
many journeyings. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b20-  رُفِعَ القَلَمُ عَنْ ثَلَاثٍ;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb;) so in the “ Firdows,” on the authority of &#39;Alee and I&#39; Ab and &#39;Áïsheh, meaning ثَلَاثِ<br>\
أَنْفُسٍ; (assumed tropical:)  [The pen of the recording angel is withheld from three persons;] a saying of Mohammad,<br>\
which means that nothing is recorded either for or<br>\
against three persons; (Mgh, Msb; *) these three<br>\
being the sleeper until he awakes, the afflicted<br>\
with disease or the like, or the demented, until<br>\
he recovers, and the child until he becomes big,<br>\
or attains to puberty. (El-Jámi&#39; -es-Sagheer of<br>\
Es-Suyootee; in which we find ثَلَاثَةٍ in the place<br>\
of ثَلَاثٍ.) This is like the saying next before<br>\
mentioned; the pen having never been put [to<br>\
the tablet to record aught] against the child.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b21-  [رَفَعَ often signifies (assumed tropical:)  He withdrew,<br>\
put away, removed, did away or did away with,<br>\

ارْفَعْ عَنَّا هٰذِهِ الضُّغْطَةَ (assumed tropical:)  [O God, withdraw, put<br>\
away, or remove, from us this straitness, difficulty, distress, or affliction]. (S in art. ضغط.)<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  He withdrew, or put away, from him the<br>\

like وَضَعُوهَا: but] is used by Moosà Ibn-Jábir<br>\

the portions, or shares, (قِسْمة, [q. v.,]) of the<br>\
land, or the house; and [some of them said,] We<br>\
will not exclude it. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b23-  In the conventional language of the grammarians, رَفْعٌ, in the<br>\
inflection of words, is like ضَمٌّ in the non-inflection. (S) [You say, رَفَعَ الحَرْفَ, aor.<br>\
رَفَعَ, inf. n.<br>\
رَفْعٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He made the final letter to have Bٌ or<br>\

inf. n. مَرْفُوعٌ (Sb, S, TA) and رَفْعٌ, (S, A, K, all in<br>\
art. خفض,) the former an inf. n. (Sb, S, TA) of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولٌ, (Sb, TA,) like [its contr. مَخْفُوضٌ,<br>\
and] مَجْلُودٌ, and مَعْقُولٌ, (S, TA,) and مَوْضُوعٌ,<br>\
(Sb, TA,) (tropical:)  The camel exerted himself to the full,<br>\
or to the utmost, or beyond measure, in going,<br>\
or pace, or in his going, or his pace: (S, K,<br>\
TA:) or was quick therein: (Msb:) or went the<br>\
pace termed مَرْفُوع, [q. v. infrà,] which is a running below that termed حُضْر: (S, TA:) as though<br>\
he had that [manner of going] which raised him,<br>\

with reference to the inf. n. مرفوع and موضوع.)<br>\
And رَفَعُوا فِى مَسِيرِهِمْ (assumed tropical:)  They [namely men] rose<br>\
above the [easy and quick pace termed] هَمْلَجَة<br>\
in their going, or journeying. (ISk.)<br>\

inf. n. رِفْعَةٌ; (S, K;) or, accord. to Aboo-Bekr<br>\
Mohammad Ibn-Es-Sereé, [so in two copies of<br>\
the S, but in others, accord. to the TA, Ibn-EsSarráj,] they did not say رَفُعَ from رَفِيعٌ in the<br>\
sense of شَرِيفٌ; (S, O;) so says Sb; and he adds,<br>\

الثَّوْبُ (assumed tropical:)  The garment, or piece of cloth, was fine,<br>\
