رَكَضَ, aor.<br>\
رَكُضَ, inf. n. رَكْضٌ, He moved,<br>\
(S, A, K,) or struck with, (Msb,) his leg, or foot:<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K:) or he struck and hit therewith,<br>\
like as one strikes and hits therewith a beast.<br>\
(IAth.) Hence, (S, A, K,) the phrase in the Kur<br>\
[xxxviii. 41], (S,) اُرْكُضْ بِرِجْلِكَ [Strike thou the<br>\
ground with thy foot]: (S, A, K:) or strike thou,<br>\
and tread, the ground with thy foot. (Sgh.) You<br>\
say also, رَكَضَ الرَّجُلُ (tropical:)  The man struck the ground<br>\
with his foot: and رَكَضَتِ الخَيْلُ (tropical:)  The horses<br>\
struck the ground with their hoofs: and جَآءَتِ<br>\
الخَيْلُ رَكْضًا (tropical:)  [The horses came striking the ground<br>\
with their hoofs]: and رَكَضَتِ الجُنْدَبُ الرَّمْضَآءَ<br>\
بِكُرَاعَيْهَا (tropical:)  [The locusts termed جندب struck the<br>\
vehemently-hot ground with their two legs]: and<br>\
تَرَكْتُهُ يَرْكُضُ بِرِجْلِهِ لِلْمَوْتِ (tropical:)  [I left him striking<br>\
the ground with his foot previously to death:<br>\
see also 8]. (A.) [The above-mentioned phrases<br>\
marked as tropical are so marked on the authority<br>\
of the A: but the reason of their being so I do<br>\
not see.] ―<br>\
-b2-  They also said, sometimes, رَكَضَ<br>\
الطَّائِرُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  The bird moved his wings in<br>\
flying: (S:) the inf. n., رَكْضٌ, signifying (tropical:)  the<br>\
act of moving the wing: (K, TA:) and الطَّائرُ<br>\
يَرْكُضُ بِجَنَاحَيْهِ (tropical:)  The bird moves his wings, and<br>\
puts them back against his body: (A, TA:) or<br>\
the former of these two phrases means (assumed tropical:)  the bird<br>\
was quick, or swift, in his flying. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  رَكْضٌ<br>\
also signifies The act of impelling; syn. دَفْعٌ: and<br>\
the urging a horse to run, (A, K, TA,) [by striking]<br>\
with his foot or leg: (TA:) the striking a beast<br>\
with one&#39;s feet or legs, to urge him: (Mgh:) or<br>\
putting him in motion, whether he go on or not.<br>\
(As.) You say, رَكَضْتُ الفَرَسَ بِرِجْلِى I urged<br>\
the horse to run, with my foot or leg. (S, O,<br>\
Msb. *) And رَكَضَ الدَّابَّةَ, aor.<br>\
رَكُضَ, inf. n. رَكْضٌ, He<br>\
struck the sides of the beast with his foot or leg.<br>\
(TA.) And رَكَضَ الدَّابَّةَ بِرِجْلٍ, and بِرِجْلَيْنِ,<br>\
He struck the beast to urge it with a foot or leg,<br>\
and with two feet or legs. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And from frequency of usage of the phrase رَكَضْتُ الفَرَسَ,<br>\
originated the saying رَكَضَ الفَرَسُ, (AZ, * S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) meaning (tropical:)  The horse ran: (S, Mgh: *)<br>\
which some disallow; but without reason, since<br>\
it has been transmitted by a good authority:<br>\
(Msb:) it is disallowed by As: (TA:) [and J<br>\
says,] the correct phrase is رُكِضَ الفَرَسُ: (S:) or<br>\
you say, رُكِضَ الفَرَسُ فَرَكَضَ هُوَ, meaning [The<br>\
horse was urged to run,] (assumed tropical:)  and he ran: (K:)<br>\
and رَكْضٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  the act of running: (K, in<br>\
another place in this art.:) and (assumed tropical:)  the act of fleeing:<br>\
whence, [in the Kur xxi. 12], إِذَا هُمْ مِنْهَا يَرْكُضُونَ<br>\
(K) (assumed tropical:)  lo, they fled from it, from punishment:<br>\
(Zj:) or (assumed tropical:)  were routed, and fled from it: (Fr:)<br>\
or they ran from it: (Mgh:) [for] رَكَضَ الرَّجُلُ<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  The man fled, and (assumed tropical:)  ran. (ISh.) [Hence,]<br>\
رَكَضَتِ النُّجُومُ فِى السَّمَآءِ (tropical:)  The stars moved along<br>\
in the sky. (A, TA.) [And hence,] رَكْضٌ also<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  A man&#39;s going along by both his legs<br>\
together. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  You also say, رَكَضَهُ البَعِيرُ<br>\
(S, A, Msb) (tropical:)  The camel struck him with his kind<br>\
leg: (S, Msb:) like as you say, رَمَحَهُ الفَرَسُ:<br>\
(A, Msb: *) but you should not say, [when a<br>\
camel is the agent,] رَمَحَهُ. (Yaakoob, S.) And<br>\
رَكَضَ الأَرْضَ, and الثَّوْبَ, (assumed tropical:)  He struck the ground,<br>\
and the garment, or piece of cloth, with his foot<br>\
or leg. (TA.) And المَرْأَةُ تَرْكُضُ ذُيُولَهَا وَخَلْخَالَهَا<br>\
بِرِجْلَيْهَا إِذَا مَشَتْ (tropical:)  [The woman kicks her skirts<br>\
and her anklets with her feet when she walks].<br>\
(A, TA.) ―<br>\

propelled the arrow. (A, TA.) ―<br>\

-b8-  And<br>\
هُوَ لَا يَرْكُضُ المِحْجَنَ (assumed tropical:)  He does not defend himself: (K:) or (assumed tropical:)  he is not angry and vexed at a<br>\
thing, nor does he defend himself. (IAar, L.) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
And رَكَضَ النَّارَ بَالمِرْكَضِ (tropical:)  [He stirred the fire<br>\
with the مَركَض]. (A.)<br>\
3<br>\
راكضهُ, (S, K,) or راكضهُ الخَيْلَ, (A,) He<br>\
contended with him in a race, each making his<br>\
horse to run. (S, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اركضت, said of a woman, (K,) or of a<br>\
mare, (A &#39;Obeyd, S, O, L,) (tropical:)  Her fœtus became<br>\
large in her belly, and moved about: (S, O, L,<br>\
K:) or her fœtus moved about in her belly:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd;) and so ↓ ارتكضت, said of a she-camel.<br>\
(A, TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
خَرَجُوا يَتَرَاكَضُونَ [They went forth contending together in urging their horses]. (A.) And<br>\
تراكضوا إِلَيْهِمْ خَيْلَهُمْ [They contended together in<br>\
urging towards them their horses] (S, A) حَتَّى<br>\
أَدْرَكُوهُمْ [until they overtook them, or came up<br>\

struggling with, or convulsed in, his legs, previously to death: see also 1, near the beginning].<br>\
(A, TA.) ―<br>\

A, K:) said of a fœtus in the belly (S, A) of a<br>\

-b4-<br>\
ارتكض فُلَانٌ فِى أَمْرِهِ (tropical:)  Such a one was, or became,<br>\
agitated, or disturbed, or disquieted, in his affair:<br>\

-b6-  See also 4.<br>\
رَكْضَةً An impulse: a motion: (K:) [pl.<br>\
رَكَضَاتٌ: see an ex. voce رَفَضَاتٌ.] Hence, (TA,)<br>\

continues to flow after menstruation is رَكْضَةٌ مِنَ<br>\
الشَّيْطَانِ, (S, * TA,) i. e. An impulse from the<br>\

of Gabriel; because it is fabled to have gushed<br>\

wings]. (TA.)<br>\
رَكُوضٌ, applied to a bow (قَوْس), (tropical:)  That sends<br>\
the arrow swiftly: (S, TA:) or that impels it<br>\
vehemently: and ↓ مُرْكِضَةٌ [or perhaps ↓ مِرْكَضَةٌ]<br>\
signifies the same. (AHn, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
رَاكِضٌ.<br>\
رَكَّاضَةٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
رَاكِضٌ, applied to a horse, (tropical:)  Running; as also<br>\
↓ رَكُوضٌ: (K:) or the correct epithet is ↓ مَرْكُوضٌ:<br>\
(S:) and ↓ رَكَّاضَةٌ signifies the same, applied to a<br>\

رَوَاكِضُ (tropical:)  I passed the night observing the stars<br>\
while they moved along in the sky. (A, TA.)<br>\
تَرْكَضَى and تِرْكِضَآءُ, the former incorrectly<br>\
written in the K تَرْكَضَآءُ, [or, in some copies,<br>\
تَرْكُضَآءُ, and the latter in one copy written<br>\
تَرْكِضَآءُ,] are there said to be used as examples by<br>\
the grammarians, but not explained; and the<br>\
author offers his opinion that they are syn. with<br>\
رَكْضٌ: (TA:) but this is a strange defect: for<br>\
AHei explains them as signifying A certain gait,<br>\
in which is a proud and self-conceited air, with<br>\
an affected inclining of the body from side to<br>\
side: and he asserts the ت to be augmentative:<br>\
(MF, TA:) and in the L they are expl. as signifying a particular kind of gait: or meaning as<br>\
above. (TA.)<br>\
مَرْكَضٌ The part of the flank of a horse which<br>\

the latter in this art. and also voce يَعْسُوبٌ,) on<br>\

and moves about in her belly; (see 4;)] as also<br>\
مُرْكِضَةٌ; (A &#39;Obeyd;) or ↓ مُرْتَكِضَةٌ. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also رَكُوضٌ.<br>\
