رَاقَ, (JK, S, K,) aor. يَرِيقُ, inf. n. رَيْقٌ,<br>\
(JK, S,) said of the سَرَاب [or mirage], It was<br>\
agitated, and moved to and fro, (JK, K,) or it<br>\
shone, or glistened, (S,) above the ground; (JK,<br>\
S, K;) and ↓ تريّق signifies the same. (S, O, K.)<br>\
[And in the former sense, راق may be said of<br>\
water; for the inf. n.] رَيْقٌ signifies also The going<br>\
to and fro (Lth, JK, K) of water, (JK,) or of<br>\
shallow water and the like, (Lth, K,) upon the<br>\
surface of the earth. (Lth, JK, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
(Ks, JK, Msb, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
(Ks, Msb,) said of water, (Ks, JK, Msb, K,)<br>\
and of blood, (Msb,) It poured out, or forth.<br>\
(Ks, Msb, K.) ―<br>\

inf. n. رُيُوقٌ (S, K) and رَيْقٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He gives up<br>\
his spirit; or gives away his life; syn. يَجُودُ بِهَا;<br>\
(JK, S, K;) at death: (S, K:) mentioned by Ks.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
رَيَّقْتُهُ الشَّرَابَ I gave him to drink the wine,<br>\
or beverage, fasting; when he had not yet eaten.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اراقهُ He poured it out, or forth. (Msb,<br>\
K.) See art. روق.<br>\
5<br>\
تَرَيَّقَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
6<br>\
هُمَا يَتَرَايَقَانِ المَآءَ and<br>\
يَتَرَاوَقَانِهِ (JK) They<br>\
two pour the water out, or forth, by turns. (TA<br>\
in explanation of the latter in art. روق.)<br>\
رَيْقٌ A shining, or glistening, (K, TA,) of a<br>\
sword [&amp;c.]. (TA.) Hence, in a trad. respecting<br>\
[the battle of] Bedr, فَإِذَا بِرَيْقِ سَيْفٍ مِنْ وَرَائِى<br>\
[And lo, the shining, or glistening, of a sword behind me]: thus written by El-Wákidee: if the<br>\
reading بَرِيقُ [from بَرَقَ] had been transmitted, it<br>\
would be evidently reasonable. (IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And i. q. بَاطِلٌ [as meaning False, or vain, speech<br>\
or conduct]. (K.) One says, أَقْصِرْ عَنْ رَيْقِكَ<br>\
[Desist thou from thy false, or vain, speech or<br>\
conduct]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  رَيْقُ اللَّيْلِ, with fet-h [to the ر],<br>\
The سَرَاب [or mirage]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  رَيْقٌ also<br>\
signifies Water: (K:) or water that is drunk in<br>\
the state of fasting, in the early morning, or first<br>\
part of the day; (TA;) [and] so ↓ رَائِقٌ, which<br>\
is [said to be] not applied [in this sense] to anything but water: you say مَآءٌ رَائِقٌ. (S.) [But<br>\
see رَائِقٌ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And خُبْزٌ رَيْقٌ (IDrd, K) and ↓ رَائِقٌ<br>\
(As, JK, K) Dry bread; i. e. bread without<br>\
seasoning, or condiment, to render it pleasant, or<br>\
savoury. (As, JK, IDrd, K.) ―<br>\

رِيقٌ Saliva; syn. رُضَابٌ; (S, K, TA;) i. e.<br>\
(TA) the water of the mouth; (JK, Msb, K,<br>\
TA;) its لُعَاب: (TA:) or the water of the mouth<br>\
in the early morning, or first part of the day;<br>\
(Lth, TA: [but this rendering is often inapplicable:]) or the water of the mouth while it is<br>\
therein; for when it has gone forth from the<br>\
mouth it is termed بُصَاقٌ and بُزَاقٌ and بُسَاقٌ: (K<br>\
in art. بصق:) and ↓ رِيقَةٌ signifies the same, in<br>\
poetry: (Msb, TA:) or this has a more particular<br>\
meaning; (S, Msb, * K;) [i. e. it means somewhat<br>\
of saliva; or a little saliva:] the pl. is أَرْيَاقٌ [a<br>\
pl. of pauc.] (S, K, TA) and رِيَاقٌ [a pl. of mult.].<br>\
(TA.) [Hence,] one says, أَبْلِعْنِى رِيقِى [Suffer<br>\
thou me to swallow my saliva;] give thou me time<br>\
to swallow my saliva: (K and TA in art. بلع:)<br>\
or (assumed tropical:)  grant thou me some delay, or let me alone for<br>\
a while, that I may say, or do, such a thing.<br>\
(Har p. 164.) [And اِبْتَلَعَ رِيقَه He swallowed<br>\
his saliva: meaning (assumed tropical:)  he restrained his anger:<br>\
see 1 in art. بلع.] And شُرِبَ عَلَى الرِّيقِ [It was<br>\
drunk in the state of fasting; before breakfast]:<br>\
(S, K:) and in like manner أُكِلَ [It was so<br>\
eaten]. (K.) And هُوَ عَلَى الرِّيقِ, (AO, S, K,)<br>\
or عَلَى رِيقِهِ, (TA,) and ↓ هُوَ رَيِّقٌ, (AO, S, K,)<br>\
of the measure فَيْعِلٌ, (S,) and ↓ رَائِقٌ, (K,) i. e.<br>\
[He is fasting;] he has not breakfasted. (TA.)<br>\
And أَتَيْتُهُ عَلَى رِيقٍ (ISk, S) and عَلَى رِيقِ نَفْسِى,<br>\
(S, TA,) and ↓ أَتَيْتُهُ رَيِّقًا and ↓ رَائِقًا, I came to<br>\
him [fasting,] not having eaten anything. (ISk,<br>\
S, TA.) [Hence also رِيقُ الشَّمْسِ, likewise called<br>\
لُعَابُ الشَّمْسِ and مُخَاطُ الشَّمْسِ and رِيقُ الشَّيَاطِينِ<br>\
and مُخَاطُ الشَّيْطَانِ, (tropical:)  The fine filmy cobwebs<br>\
termed gossamer: see arts. لعب and مخط.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also Strength: and the remains of life, or of the<br>\
spirit, or of the soul: syns. قُوَّةٌ and رَمَقٌ [which<br>\
latter, it should be observed, has both of these<br>\
meanings, so that possibly only the former meaning may be here intended]. (K.) You say,<br>\
كَانَ هٰذَا الأَمْرُ وَبِنَا رِيقٌ This event happened when<br>\
there was in us strength. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
رَيْقَةٌ, accord. to Freytag, as occurring in the<br>\
Deewán El-Hudhaleeyeen, signifies The beginning of youth: but perhaps this may be a mistake,<br>\
occasioned by some one&#39;s saying that the beginning of youth is termed ريقه, meaning رَيْقُهُ.]<br>\
رِيقَةٌ: see رِيقٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  ذو الريقة is said by Z to be<br>\
the name of a sword of Murrah Ibn-Rabee&#39;ah.<br>\
(TA: but the vowel-signs are not there written.)<br>\
رَائِقٌ Anything eaten, or drunk, عَلَى الرِّيقِ<br>\
[i. e. in the state of fasting; before breakfast].<br>\

-b2-  And see رِيقٌ,<br>\
likewise in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Empty-handed.<br>\
(K.) You say, جَآءَ رَائِقًا (assumed tropical:)  He came empty<br>\
[-handed]. (JK.)<br>\

to musk, and to anything. (As, TA.) [Mentioned<br>\
also in art. روق.]<br>\
-A3-  Also said to signify ثوب<br>\
عجن بالمسك [i. e. عُجِنَ بِالمِسْكِ, app. meaning<br>\
that it is an epithet applied to a garment as signifying Sprinkled with musk and then pressed, or<br>\
kneaded]. (TA.)<br>\
رَيِّقٌ: see رِيقٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also, (S,) and<br>\
↓ رَيْقٌ, (S, K,) which is a contraction of the former, sometimes used, (S,) and ↓ رَيُّوقٌ, (AO, K,)<br>\
The first part, (S, K,) and the most excellent,<br>\
of anything, as, for instance, of youth, and of<br>\
rain. (S.) [The first and second are also mentioned in art. روق, q. v. J cites here, and ascribes<br>\
to Lebeed, as an ex. of the second of these words,<br>\
a verse which I have cited in the third paragraph<br>\
of art. عرض, but with رَوْقَ in the place of رَيْقَ,<br>\
from the TA, in which it is ascribed to ElBa&#39;eeth.]<br>\
رَيُّوقٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
تِرْيَاقٌ, said in the T to be so called because<br>\
containing the saliva of serpents, is explained in<br>\
art. ترق. (TA.)<br>\
مَرَاقٌ [app. a n. of place from رَاقَ having for<br>\
its aor. يَرِيقُ said of water; though anomalous;<br>\
for by rule it should be مَرِيقٌ;] The part, of the<br>\
throat, which is the place of passage of the water.<br>\
(T and TA in art. درأ: see the last sentence of the<br>\
first paragraph of that art.)<br>\
مُرَيَّقٌ One in whom a thing ceases not to induce<br>\
wonder, or admiration, and pleasure, or joy; or<br>\
whom a thing ceases not to please, or rejoice:<br>\
(K:) occurring in a verse of Ru-beh: but Sgh<br>\
says that it should by rule be مُرَوَّقٌ. (TA.)<br>\
