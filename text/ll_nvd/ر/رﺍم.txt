رَئِمَتْ وَلَدَهَا, (T, S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
رَاَ^َ, (T,) inf. n.<br>\
رِئْمَانٌ, (T, S, M, K *) and رَأْمٌ (M, K *) and رَأَمَانٌ,<br>\
(TA,) She (a camel) loved, (T, S,) or affected,<br>\
or inclined to, and kept to, or clave to, (M, K,)<br>\
her young one. (T, S, M, K.) And تَرْأَمُ بِأَنْفِهَا is<br>\
also said of a she-camel [as meaning She makes a<br>\
show of affection with her nose, by smelling her<br>\
young one; not having true love]. (S, M, K, all<br>\
in art. ذأر; &amp;c. [See مُذَائِرٌ, and see also مُعَارِضٌ.])<br>\
A poet says,<br>\
أَمْ كَيْفَ يَنْفَعُ مَا تُعْطِى العَلُوقُ بِهِ<br>\
رِئْمَانٌ أَنْفٍ إِذَا مَا ضُنَّ بِاللَّبَنِ<br>\
or رئمانُ, or رئمانِ, accord. to different relaters:<br>\
[i. e. Or how profits what she that smells a young<br>\
one but refuses to yield her milk to it gives, (the<br>\
ب in بِهِ being redundant,) showing affection<br>\
with the nose, (accord. to the first reading,)<br>\
or a showing of affection with the nose, (accord. to the second and third readings,) when<br>\
there is niggardliness with the milk?] he who<br>\
says رئمانَ uses this word as an inf. n.: he<br>\
who says رئمانُ makes it a substitute for ما:<br>\
and he who says رئمانِ makes it a substitute for<br>\
the ه [in بِهِ]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] رَئِمَ الشَّىْءَ (tropical:)  He<br>\
loved the thing, (S, K, TA,) and (S, K, TA)<br>\
kept, or clave, to it. (S, M, K, TA.) One says,<br>\
رَئِمَتِ الأَثَافِى الرَّمَادَ (tropical:)  [The three stones whereon<br>\
the cooking-pot was placed clave to the ashes]:<br>\
as though the ashes were their young. (T, K, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And رَئِمَ الجُرْحُ, inf. n. رِئْمَانٌ (AZ, T, S, M)<br>\
and رَأْمٌ, (M, K,) (tropical:)  The wound coalesced, or closed;<br>\
(AZ, T, S, TA;) the mouth of the wound drew<br>\
together, or closed, preparatively to healing.<br>\
(M, K, * TA.)<br>\
-A2-  رَأَمَ, (T, S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
رَاَ^َ,<br>\
(T, K,) inf. n. رَأْمٌ, (T, M,) He repaired (T, S,<br>\
M, K) a crack, or fissure, (M,) or a bowl, (T, K,)<br>\
or a crack, or fissure, of a bowl: (S:) like رَأَبَ:<br>\
(T, M:) so says Esh-Sheybánee: and [↓ رَآءَمَهُ<br>\
signifies the same; for] he cites the following<br>\
verse:<br>\
وَقَتْلَى بِحِقْفٍ مِنْ أُوَارَةَ جُدِّعَتْ<br>\
صَدَعْنَ قُلُوبًا لَمْ تُرَآءَمْ شُعُوبُهَا<br>\
[And slain men in a winding tract of sand of<br>\
Uwáreh, (a certain water, or mountain, of<br>\
Temeem,) that had been mutilated, broke hearts<br>\
of which the rifts have not been repaired].<br>\
(S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He twisted a rope hard, or<br>\
strongly; as also ↓ ارأم. (M, K.)<br>\
3<br>\
رَاَّ^َ see the last sentence but one above.<br>\
4<br>\
ارأم النَّاقَةَ He made the she-camel to affect,<br>\
or incline to, (ISk, T, S, K,) her رَأْم [q. v.],<br>\
(ISk, T,) or the رَأْم, (S,) or one that was not her<br>\
young one: (K:) or ارأمها عَلَى وَلَدِهَا he made<br>\
her to affect, or incline to, her young one. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ارأمهُ عَلَى الأَمْرِ, (ISk, T,) or على<br>\
الشَّىْءِ, (M, K,) (assumed tropical:)  He compelled him against his<br>\
will to do the thing: (ISk, T, M, K:) and so<br>\
ازأمهُ عَلَيْهِ. (TA.) And ارأمهُ إِلَىكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He, or<br>\
it, caused him to want such a thing. (AA, TA in<br>\
art. ذمغ.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ارأم الجُرْحَ, (inf. n. إِرآمٌ, T,) (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
dressed, or treated curatively, the wound, (T, S,<br>\
M, K,) in order that it might heal, or close, (S,)<br>\
or so that it closed. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 1, last<br>\
sentence.<br>\
5<br>\
ترأّمت عَلَى وَلَدِهَا, said of a she-camel, i. q.<br>\
تَعَطَّفَتْ عَلَيْهِ [app. meaning, as quasi-pass. of<br>\
عَطَّفَهَا عَلَيْهِ, She was made to affect, or incline to,<br>\
her young one]. (TT, from the M. [There written<br>\
ترآمت, which is, in my opinion, a mistranscription.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  تَرَأَّمْتُهُ i. q. تَرَحَّمْتُ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  [I pitied, or<br>\
compassionated, him; or did so much; or affected,<br>\
or expressed, pity, or compassion, or much pity or<br>\
compassion, for him; or expressed a wish that<br>\
God would have mercy on him]. (K, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
ارتأم, said by Golius to signify It (a<br>\
wound) closed, or became consolidated, as on the<br>\
authority of the S and K, I do not find in any<br>\
copy of either of those lexicons, nor in any other<br>\
lexicon.]<br>\
رَأْمٌ A she-camel&#39;s young one; (T, S;) accord.<br>\
to IAar: (T:) or a she-camel&#39;s young one which<br>\
she affects, or to which she inclines: (M:) and,<br>\
(S, M,) accord. to Lth, (T,) i. q. بَوٌّ [which has<br>\
the former of the meanings above, but more commonly signifies a skin of a young unweaned camel<br>\
stuffed with straw or with panic grass or with<br>\
dry herbage, to which a she-camel is made to<br>\
incline when her young one has died; it being<br>\
brought near to the mother of a young camel<br>\
that has died, in order that she may incline to it<br>\
and yield her milk]: (T, S, M, K:) or a young<br>\
one to which she that is not its mother is made to<br>\
incline. (T.)<br>\
فُلَانٌ رُؤْمٌ لِلضَّيْمِ [evidently, I think, a mistranscription, for ↓ رَؤُومٌ, which is also written رَؤُمٌ,]<br>\
(tropical:)  Such a one is abject, or ignominious; content to<br>\
endure injury.. (TA.)<br>\
رِثْمٌ [The antilope leucoryx, or white antelope;]<br>\
an antelope (ظَبْىٌ) that is purely white; (T, [in<br>\
which only the pl. is mentioned,] S, M, K;) so<br>\
accord. to As; (T, S;) and AZ says the like;<br>\
(T;) inhabiting the sands: (As, T, S:) or, as<br>\
some say, the young one of the ظَبْى [here app.<br>\
meaning gazelle]: the female is called رِئْمَةٌ:<br>\
(M:) pl. أَرْآمٌ (T, S, M, K) and آرَامٌ; (M, K;)<br>\
the latter pl. formed by transposition. (M.)<br>\
[Whether the Hebrew<br>\
XXX or  or<br>\
mean the same animal as the Arabic رِئْم is<br>\
doubtful.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] مَرَّتْ بِنَاالآرَامُ (tropical:)  The<br>\
beautiful, or pretty, women passed, or went, by<br>\
us: so called by way of comparison. (TA.)<br>\
رُئِمٌ, (K, TA,) or الرُّئِمُ, thus accord. to Kr, with<br>\
ال, (M,) i. q. الاِسْتُ [The podex, or the anus]:<br>\
(Kr, M, K:) [said to be] the only word of its<br>\
measure except الدُّئِلُ, which means “ a certain<br>\
small beast. ” (M. [But see this last word.])<br>\
الرَّأْمَةٌ The خَزَرة [i. e. bead, or the like, that is<br>\
worn as an amulet, and] that is [held to be] a<br>\
cause of love, or affection. (K.)<br>\
رُؤْمَةٌ Glue, with which a thing is stuck: (S:)<br>\
accord. to the K, [following A&#39;Obeyd, (see art.<br>\
روم,)] it is رُومَةٌ only, without ء: but Th mentions<br>\
it with ء also; and both are correct. (MF, TA.)<br>\
رُؤَامٌ Slaver: (T, K:) like رُوَالٌ. (T.) [See<br>\
also رُوَامٌ, in art. روم.]<br>\
رَوُومٌ: see رَائِمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A ewe, or she-goat,<br>\
(El-Umawee, T, S, K,) that is very familiar,<br>\
(K,) that licks the clothes of him who passes by<br>\
her. (El-Umawee, T, S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also رُؤْمٌ.<br>\
رَائِمٌ, (T, M,) or رَائِمَةٌ, (S,) or both, (K,) and<br>\
↓ رَؤُومٌ, (T, S, M, K,) [but the last has probably<br>\
an intensive signification,] A she-camel that loves,<br>\
(T, S,) or affects, or inclines to, and keeps to, or<br>\
cleaves to, (M, K,) her young one, (T, S, M, K,)<br>\
or the young one of another: if she do not so, but<br>\
smells it, and does not yield her milk to it, she is<br>\
termed عَلُوقٌ: so says A&#39;Obeyd, on the authority<br>\
of As: (T: [see the former of the two verses<br>\
cited in the first paragraph of this art.:]) the pl.<br>\
of رَائِمَةٌ is رَوَائِمُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, الرَّوَائِمُ signifies (tropical:)  The three stones whereon the cooking-pot is<br>\
placed; what are called الأَثَافِى; (T, M, K, TA;)<br>\
that have remained cleaving to the ashes: (T, K:)<br>\
because of their cleaving to the ashes: (M:) the<br>\
ashes being as though they were their young.<br>\
(T, K.)<br>\
