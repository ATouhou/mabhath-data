رَامَ, (T, S, M, Msb,) aor. يَرُومُ, (T, S, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. رَوْمٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and مَرَامٌ, (Msb, K,<br>\
TA,) He sought, sought for or after, or desired,<br>\
syn. طَلَبَ, (T, * M, Msb, K, *) a thing. (S, M,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence, He attempted another<br>\
person in fight &amp;c., and a thing.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence<br>\
also] الرَّوْمُ, (K,) or رَوْمُ الحَرَكَةِ, mentioned by<br>\
Sb, (S,) [as though signifying The desiring to<br>\
pronounce the vowel-sound without fully accomplishing that desire,] means [the pronouncing]<br>\
a vowel-sound (حَرَكَة) slurred (مُخْتَلَسَة) and<br>\
rendered obscure, (S, K,) for, or by, [accord. to<br>\
different copies of the S,] a sort of alleviation [of<br>\
the utterance]; (S;) it is more [in effect] than<br>\
what is termed الإِشْمَام, because it is heard; (S,<br>\
K;) and it is of the same measure [in prosody]<br>\
as the vowel-sound [fully pronounced]; as [in the<br>\
case of what is termed] هَمْزَةٌ بَيْنَ بَيْنَ, such as in<br>\
the saying of the poet,<br>\
أَاَنْ زُمَّ أَجْمَالٌ وَفَارَقَ جِيرَةٌ<br>\
وَ صَاحَ غُرَابُ البَيْنِ أَنْتَ حَزِينُ<br>\
[Is it because that camels have had the nose-reins<br>\
attached to them, and neighbours have separated,<br>\
one from another, and the raven of disunion has<br>\
uttered its cry, thou art mourning?]; أَاَنْ زُمْ<br>\
being scanned as فَعُولُنْ; and it not being allowable to make the ع [in فعولن] quiescent: it is<br>\
such also as in the phrase in the Kur [ii. 181]<br>\
شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ with him who makes [the dammeh]<br>\
obscure; it being only with a slurred vowel-sound<br>\
(حَرَكَة مُخْتَلَسَة); and it not being allowable for<br>\
the former ر [i. e. the ر of شهر] to be quiescent,<br>\
because the ه before it is quiescent, for this would<br>\
lead to the combination of two quiescent letters in<br>\
a case of continuity, [i. e. when there is no pause<br>\
after them,] without there being before them a<br>\
soft letter [i. e. ا or و or ى, as in دَوَابّ &amp;c.],<br>\
which is not found in any of the dialects of the<br>\
Arabs: and it is such also as in the instances in<br>\
the Kur [xv. 9 and x. 36 and xxxvi. 49] إِنَّا نَحْنُ<br>\
نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ and أَمَّنْ لَا يَهِدِّى and يَخِصِّمُونَ [for<br>\
يَهْتَدِى and يَخْتَصِمُونَ], and the like thereof:<br>\
no regard should be paid to the saying of Fr, that<br>\
in this [last] and the like instances a letter [which<br>\
in this instance and in the next preceding it<br>\
is ت] is incorporated into another [following it];<br>\
for they [i. e. the Arabs] do not realize this mode<br>\
[of incorporation]; and he who combines two<br>\
quiescent letters in an instance in which the<br>\
slurring of the vowel-sound (اِخْتِلَاسُ الحَرَكَةِ) is<br>\
not proper errs; as in the reading of Hamzeh, in<br>\
the Kur [xviii. 96], فَمَا اسطَّاعُوا; for the س of<br>\
الاِسْتِفْعَالُ may not be made movent in any<br>\
manner [and therefore it may not be incorporated<br>\
into the following letter]. (S, TA.) الرَّوْمُ is [also]<br>\
in a case of pausing after a word ending with any<br>\
letter except the fem. ة, [in like manner] meaning<br>\
The indicating the vowel with an obscure sound:<br>\
(I&#39; Ak p. 351:) رَوْمُ الحَرَكَةِ in pausing after a<br>\
word that is مَرْفُوع or مَجْرُور is from رَامَ الشَّىْءَ<br>\
signifying طَلَبَهُ: Sb says that those of whom one<br>\
says رَامُوا الحَرَكَةَ [They slurred the vowel-sound]<br>\
are induced to do what this signifies [instead of<br>\
suppressing the vowel-sound entirely] by eagerness to exclude it from the case of that which is<br>\
necessarily made quiescent in every instance, and<br>\
to show that its case is, in their opinion, not like<br>\
the case of that which is made quiescent in every<br>\
instance. (M.) [See also 4 in art. شور.]<br>\
2<br>\
روّم فُلَانًا (Msb, K) followed by الشَّىْءَ,<br>\
(Msb,) and (K) روّم بِفُلَانٍ, (IAar, S, K,) He<br>\
made such a one to seek, seek for or after, or<br>\
desire, the thing. (IAar, S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And روّم<br>\
رَأْيَهُ He meditated, intended, purposed, desired,<br>\
or endeavoured, to do one thing after another.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
-A2-  And روّم He tarried; paused; tarried<br>\
and waited or expected; or was patient, and<br>\
tarried and waited or expected. (K.)<br>\
Quasi 4. أَرَمْتَ, for أَرْمَمْتَ: see the latter, near<br>\
the end of the first paragraph of art. رم.<br>\
5<br>\
تروّم بِهِ, or بِهَا, accord. to different copies of<br>\
the K, (TA,) He mocked at, scoffed at, laughed<br>\
at, derided, or ridiculed, him, or her. (K, TA.)<br>\
رَامٌ A certain species of trees. (S, K. *)<br>\
رَوْمٌ inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (T, S, M, &amp;c.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also what next follows.<br>\
رُومٌ The lobe, or lobule, of the ear; (M, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ رُومٌ. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  الرُّومُ A certain nation,<br>\
(M, K,) well known; (M;) [said by the Arabs<br>\
to be] descendants of Er-Room, the son of Esau<br>\
(عيصُو [so called by the Arabs]), (T, * S, K,) the<br>\
son of Isaac the Prophet; (TA;) [i. e. the<br>\
Greeks; generally meaning, of the Lower Empire; but sometimes, only those of Asia; and<br>\
sometimes those of the Lower Empire together<br>\
with all the nations of Europe beside: the ancient<br>\
Greeks are more properly called by the Arabs<br>\
اليُونَانُ:] one says ↓ رُومِىٌّ and رُومٌ; (S, K;) the<br>\
former of these two appellations being applied to<br>\
a single person, (M, K,) and the latter being<br>\
the pl., (S, K,) [or rather a coll. gen. n.,] like<br>\
زِنْجِىٌّ and زِنْجٌ; (AAF, S, M;) the former being<br>\
distinguished from the latter only by the doubled<br>\
ى, like as تَمْرَةٌ is distinguished from تَمْرٌ its pl.<br>\
[or coll. gen. n.] only by the ة: (S:) and رُومِىٌّ<br>\
has for [its proper] pl. ↓ أَرْوَامٌ. (TA.) [It is also<br>\
applied to The country of the nation, or people, so<br>\
called, both in Europe and Asia, and sometimes<br>\
only in Asia. Hence, بَحْرُ الرُّومِ The Sea of the<br>\
Greeks; meaning the Mediterranean Sea.]<br>\
رُومَةٌ Glue, with which the feathers of an arrow<br>\
are stuck: (M, K:) said by A&#39;Obeyd to be [thus]<br>\
without ء; but mentioned by Th with ء. (M,<br>\
TA. [See art. رأم.])<br>\
رُومِىٌّ The sail of an empty ship: (AA, T, K:)<br>\
that of a full ship is called مُرْبِعٌ. (AA, T.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also رُومٌ.<br>\
رُوَامٌ i. q. لُغَامٌ [The foam of the mouth of a<br>\
camel]: (K:) mentioned also in art. رُؤَامٌ [as<br>\
written رُؤَامٌ, and signifying slaver]. (TA.)<br>\
رُوَّامٌ [pl. of ↓ رَائِمٌ, which signifies Seeking, &amp;c.;<br>\
act. part. n. of 1:] i. q. طُلَّابٌ [pl. of طَالِبٌ].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رَائِمٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
أَرْوَامٌ pl. of رُومِىٌّ. (TA.) See رُومٌ.<br>\
مَرَامٌ i. q. مَطْلَبْ (S, M, K) [accord. to the PS<br>\
A place of seeking or searching: but it should be<br>\
observed that مَطْلَبٌ is an inf. n., and also a n. of<br>\
place and of time: also that مَرَامٌ is expressly said<br>\
in the Msb and TA to be an inf. n. of رَامَ, though<br>\
not in the S nor in the M: and that it is mentioned in the K in the beginning of this art. as<br>\
syn. with رَوْمٌ in the sense of طَلَبٌ, and at the end<br>\
of the art. as signifying the same as مَطْلَبٌ]. One<br>\
says, هُوَ ثَبْتُ المَقَامِ بَعِيدُ المَرَامِ [which may mean<br>\
He is firm, or steady, in respect of the place of<br>\
standing; far-aiming in respect of the place of<br>\
seeking: or, agreeably with an explanation voce<br>\
ثَبْتٌ, he is one who does not quit his station, or<br>\
abode, without necessity, though far-aiming &amp;c.:<br>\
but it is obvious that both المقام and المرام may<br>\
here be inf. ns.]. (TA.)<br>\
مَرُومٌ Sought, sought for or after, or desired.<br>\
