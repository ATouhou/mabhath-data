اِرْجَحَنَّ It (a thing, S) inclined, bent, or<br>\
declined. (S, K.) Hence the prov.,<br>\
إِذَا ارْجَحَنَّ شَاصِيًا فَارْفَعْ يَدًا<br>\
(S, Meyd,) or ارْجَعَنَّ, or اجْرَعَنَّ, accord. to different readings, the last being formed by transposition from the second, (Meyd,) i. e. When he (a<br>\
man, Meyd) inclines, (S, Meyd,) or falls, (Meyd,)<br>\
raising his legs, then hold thou back [thine arm,<br>\
or thy hand,] from him; meaning, when he becomes lowly, humble, or submissive, to thee, hold<br>\
thou back from him: (S, Meyd:) or it is said to<br>\
a man fighting with another, and means when<br>\
thou overcomest him, and he lies on his side, and<br>\
falls, and raises his legs, then hold thou back<br>\
thine arm, or thy hand, from him: (TA in art.<br>\
رجعن, in explanation of the second reading:)<br>\
[or when he is prostrated, and stretched upon the<br>\
ground: for,] accord. to As, ارجحنّ and ارجعنّ<br>\
signify he was prostrated, and stretched upon<br>\
the ground. (TA in art. رجعن.) And you say,<br>\
ارجحنّ السَّحَابُ بَعْدَ تَبَسُّقٍ The clouds became<br>\
heavy, and inclined [downwards], after being high.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also It (a thing, S) fell at once. (S,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And It (a thing, S) shook; quivered; or<br>\
was, or became, in a state of commotion. (S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And ارجحنّ السَّرَابُ i. q. اِرْتَفَعَ [i. e. The mirage<br>\
became upraised, withdrawn, or removed]. (K.)<br>\
مُرْجَحِنٌّ [part. n. of the verb above]. You say,<br>\
أَنَا فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ مُرْجَحِنٌّ I am wavering, or<br>\
vacillating, and inclining, in this affair. (TA.)<br>\
And اِمْرَأَةٌ مُرْجَحِنَّةٌ A fat woman, who, when she<br>\
walks, bends in her gait. (TA.) And جَيْشٌ<br>\
مُرْجَحِنُّ A heavy army. (S, K.) And رحًى<br>\
مُرْجَحِنَّةٌ A heavy round cloud. (S, * K, * and A<br>\
in art. رجح. [In the S and K, only the latter<br>\
word is explained; though the meaning of the<br>\
former (i. e. سَحَابَةٌ مُسْتَدِيرَةٌ, as in the A,) is<br>\
plainly indicated in the S by a verse there cited.])<br>\
And فُلَانٌ فِى دُنْيَا مُرْجَحِنَّةٍ Such a one is in an<br>\
ample, abundant, state of worldly prosperity.<br>\
(TA.) And لَيْلٌ مُرْجَحِنٌّ Heavy, wide-spreading,<br>\
night. (TA.)<br>\
The author of the K follows ISd and J and<br>\
Az in regarding the ن in this case as radical:<br>\
but IAth says that some hold it to be augmentative; and the derivation to be from رَجَحَ الشَّىْءُ,<br>\
meaning “ the thing was, or became, heavy. ”<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
