رَاغَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. يَرُوغُ, (S, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
رَوْغٌ (S, Msb, K) and رَوَغَانٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
said of a fox, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and of a man,<br>\
(K,) He turned aside or away from a thing:<br>\
(K:) or went this way and that, (Mgh,) or to<br>\
the right and left, quickly, (Msb,) and deceitfully,<br>\
or guilefully: (Mgh, Msb:) [or turned aside to<br>\
deceive him who was behind him: for] the primary signification of رَوْغٌ is the turning aside to<br>\
deceive him who is behind one. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
It is said in a prov.,<br>\
رُوغِى جَعَارِ وَ انْظُرِى أَيْنَ المَفِرْ<br>\
[for المَفِرُّ, i. e. Turn aside or away, or go this<br>\
way and that, &amp;c., O she-hyena, and look where<br>\
is the place to which to flee: or, as some relate it,<br>\
the first word is رُوعِى: see art. جعر]. (S, TA.<br>\
[Freytag seems to have found المعز for المفر; and<br>\
has explained رُوغِى جَعَارِ as meaning “ Vide ubi<br>\
capræ sint, hyæna! ”]) And you say, راغ الصَّيْدُ<br>\
The game, or object of the chase, went away this<br>\
way and that, or hither and thither. (TA.<br>\
[There said to be tropical; but I see not wherefore.]) And one says, راغ عَنْ فُلَانٍ He turned<br>\
aside, or away, from such a one [and particularly<br>\
with deceit or guile; eluded him; dodged him].<br>\
(JK.) And هُوَ يَرُوغُ عَنِ الحَقِّ [He deviates from<br>\
the truth, or from that which is right or just].<br>\
(TA.) And راغ الطَّرِيقُ The road turned aside or<br>\
away, or deviated. (Msb.) And راغ مِنْ كَذَا<br>\
He turned away from such a thing, and returned,<br>\
concealing his return: (Har p. 21:) [for,] accord.<br>\
to Fr, راغ is not said of one who has returned<br>\
unless he concealed his return. (Har ibid., and<br>\
TA.) And راغ إِلَى كَذَا, (S, Msb,) or الى فُلَانٍ,<br>\
(TA,) He turned aside (S, Msb, TA) to such a<br>\
thing, (S, Msb,) or to such a one, (TA,) secretly.<br>\
(S, Msb, TA.) Hence, in the Kur [li. 26], فَراغَ<br>\
إِلَى أَهْلِهِ فَجَآءَ بِعِجْلٍ سَمِينٍ And he turned aside,<br>\
(Jel, TA,) or went away, (Bd,) to his family<br>\
secretly [and brought a fat calf]: (Bd, Jel, TA:)<br>\
or he returned to his family concealing his return.<br>\
(Fr, TA.) And in the Kur [xxxvii. 91], فَرَاغَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِمْ ضَرْبًا بِالْيَمِينِ And he turned against them<br>\
(Fr, S, Bd, TA) secretly, (Bd, TA,) smiting them<br>\
with the right hand, or because of the oath that<br>\
he had sworn; (Bd;) as though the رَوْغ in this<br>\
case consisted in his employing a pretext against<br>\
them in order that he might do to their gods what<br>\
he did: (S, L:) or the meaning is, he advanced<br>\
against them. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  راغ حَاجَةً إِلَى فُلَانٍ,<br>\
aor. as above, He sought to obtain quickly an<br>\
object of want of such a one. (JK, TA. [See<br>\
also 4.]<br>\
2<br>\
روّغ, (IAar, K,) inf. n. تَرْوِيغٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
smeared, seasoned, imbued, or soaked, a mess of<br>\
ثَرِيد [i. e. broken, or crumbled, bread], (IAar,<br>\
K, TA,) or a morsel, or mouthful, (TA,) with<br>\
grease, or gravy, or dripping; (IAar, K, TA;)<br>\
as also مَرَّغَ, and سَغْبَلَ, and رَوَّلَ: (TA:) or you<br>\
say, رَوَّغْتُ اللُّقْمَةَ بِالسَّمْنِ, inf. n. as above, I<br>\
smeared, seasoned, imbued, or soaked, the morsel,<br>\
or mouthful, with clarified butter; as also رَيَّغْتُ:<br>\
(Msb:) or رَوَّغْتُ الخُبْزَ فِى الوَدَكِ I soaked the<br>\
bread in grease, or gravy, or dripping; syn.<br>\
رَوَّلْتُهُ فِيهِ. (JK.)<br>\
3<br>\
راوغهُ, (MA, TA,) inf. n. مُرَاوَغَةٌ (KL, TA)<br>\
and رِوَاغٌ, (TA,) He practised deceit, delusion,<br>\
guile, or artifice, (MA, KL, TA,) with him, or<br>\
towards him; (MA, TA;) or strove, endeavoured, or desired, to deceive, delude, beguile,<br>\
circumvent, or outwit, him; syn. خَادَعَهُ; as also<br>\
↓ اراغهُ, inf. n. إِرَاغَةٌ: and both signify he endeavoured to turn him; or endeavoured to turn him<br>\
by blandishment, or by deceitful arts, or to entice<br>\
him to turn; syn. رَاوَدَهُ. (TA.) It is said when<br>\
its object is a person who has turned away from,<br>\
or shunned, or avoided, that which one has<br>\
devised, planned, or plotted, against him. (TA.)<br>\
You say, فُلَانٌ يُرَاوِغُ فِى الأَمْرِ [Such a one<br>\
practises deceit, &amp;c., in the affair], inf. n. مُرَاوَغَةٌ.<br>\
(S.) And مَا زِلْتُ أُرَاوِغُهُ عَنْ كَذَا I ceased not to<br>\
endeavour to turn him, or to entice him to turn,<br>\
from such a thing, syn. أُرَاوِدُهُ; (TA in this art;)<br>\
and عَلَيْهِ to it: (TA in art. منع:) and [in like<br>\
manner] you say, عَلَى أَمْرٍ ↓ فُلَانٌ يُرِيغُنِى Such a<br>\
one endeavours to turn me, or to entice me to<br>\
turn, to a thing; and عَنْ أَمْرٍ from a thing; syn.<br>\
يُرَاوِدُنِى; and seeks, or demands, my doing so.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مُرَاوَغَةٌ also signifies The act of wrestling together; (S, K;) like ↓ تَرَاوُغٌ. (K.) You<br>\
say, رَاوغهُ He wrestled with him: (TK:) or رواغ<br>\
بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا One of them wrestled with another;<br>\
[or they wrestled, one with another; or they<br>\
wrestled together;] as also ↓ تراوغوا. (S, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَرْوَغَ see 3, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  اراغ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. إِرَاغَةٌ, (Msb, TA,) also signifies He sought,<br>\
sought for or after, sought to find and take or<br>\
get, or pursued after, and desired, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
a thing; (Msb;) or a thing that was difficult to<br>\
take; as though it turned aside or away, or went<br>\
this way and that, &amp;c., (كَأَنَّهُ يَرُوغُ,) before him;<br>\
(Har p. 21;) and ↓ ارتاغ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
اِرْتِيَاغٌ, (Msb,) signifies the same. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
[أَرِيغُونِى إِرَاغَتَكُمْ is expl. in one of my two copies<br>\
of the S by the words اُطْلُبُونِى طَلِبَتَكُمْ: in the<br>\
other of those copies, the latter of these words is<br>\
written طلِبتَكم: I think that the right reading is<br>\
طِلْبَتَكُمْ; and the meaning, Seek ye me with, or<br>\
in, your mode, or manner, of seeking: the proper<br>\
meaning is seek ye me with your seeking.] Khálid<br>\
Ibn-Jaafar Ibn-Kiláb says, speaking of his mare<br>\
حِذْقَة,<br>\
أَرِيغُونِى إِرَاغَتَكُمْ فَإِنِّى<br>\
وَ حِذْقَةَ كَالشَّجَا تَحْتَ الوَرِيدِ<br>\
[Seek ye me with your seeking; but ye will not<br>\
be able to take me; for I, with Hidhkah, am<br>\
like the bone sticking fast in the throat beneath<br>\
the carotid artery]. (TA.) And you say, أَرَغْتُ<br>\
الصَّيْدَ [I sought, or pursued, the game, or object<br>\
of the chase]. (S.) And اراغت العُقَابُ الصَّيْدَ<br>\
The eagle pursued the game this way and that,<br>\
as the latter went. (Mgh and TA in art. هوى.)<br>\
And خَرَجْتُ أُرِيغُ بَعِيرًا شَرَدَ مِنِّى I went forth<br>\
seeking in every road, or way, a camel that had<br>\
run away from me. (TA, from a trad.) And<br>\
مَا ذَا تُرِيغُ What is this that thou seekest and<br>\
desirest? or that which thou seekest and desirest?<br>\
(S, TA.) And فُلَانٌ يُرِيغُ كَذَا وَ كَذَا Such a one<br>\

رِيَاغَةٌ The wrestling-place of a people; (Yz,<br>\
JK, S, K;) as also ↓ رِوَاغَةٌ, (K,) which is the<br>\
original form, the و being afterwards changed<br>\
into ى because of the kesreh before it, though<br>\
this, as Sgh says, is not a necessary sort of conversion; (TA;) or ↓ رَاغَةٌ. (So in the JK.)<br>\
رُوَيْغَةٌ i. q. حِيلَةٌ [meaning An evasion or<br>\
elusion, a shift, a wile, an artifice, an artful<br>\

has a similar meaning also in a saying cited voce<br>\
حَوْجَآءُ, q. v.]<br>\
رَوَاغَآءُ and رُوَاغَآءُ: see رَوَاغٌ.<br>\
رَوَّاغٌ [Wont to turn aside or away from a<br>\
thing: or to go this way and that, or to the right<br>\
and left, quickly, and deceitfully, or guilefully:<br>\
or to turn aside for the purpose of deceiving him<br>\
who is behind: or to elude, or dodge]. Mo&#39;áwiyeh<br>\

ثَعْلَبٌ رَوَّاغٌ كُلَّمَا خَرَجْتَ مِنْ جُحْرٍ انْجَحَرْتَ فِى<br>\
جُحْرٍ [Thou art only a fox wont to elude: whenever thou comest forth from a burrow, thou<br>\
enterest into a burrow]. (TA.) [Hence,] الرَّوَّاغُ<br>\
is an appellation of The fox. (JK, K.)<br>\
طَرِيقٌ رَائِغٌ A deviating road. (S, TA.) Hence<br>\
↓ رَائِغَةٌ [as a subst.] A road deviating from the<br>\

[Every one of them is more wont to elude than a<br>\
fox: how like is this night to yesternight!  meaning, how like are they, one to another! see art.<br>\
