(S, Msb, K.) And راح, aor. يَرُوحُ, inf. n. رُؤُوحٌ,<br>\
It (a day) was one of good, or pleasant, wind.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  راح, aor. يَرَاحُ, inf. n. رَوْحٌ, It was, or<br>\
became, cool and pleasant [by means of the wind].<br>\
(L.) It (a house, or tent, the door being opened,)<br>\
[was, or became, aired by the wind; or] was<br>\
entered by the wind. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  راح الشَّجَرُ The<br>\
trees felt the wind. (AHn, K.) [See also another<br>\
meaning below.] ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence, perhaps,] راح, aor.<br>\
يَرَاحُ, inf. n. رَاحٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, brisk,<br>\
lively, sprightly, active, agile, prompt, or quick;<br>\
[as though he felt the wind and was refreshed by<br>\
it;] (L;) as also ↓ ارتاح: (S, A, L, K:) رَاحٌ and<br>\
↓ اِرْتِيَاحٌ signify the same: (S, L, K: [in the CK,<br>\
الاِرْتِياحِ is erroneously put for الاِرْتِيَاحُ:]) and<br>\
↓ اِسْتَرْوَحَ (assumed tropical:)  he (a man) became light, or active, and<br>\
quick; syn. شَمَّرَ. (Msb.) You say, راح لِلشَّىْءِ<br>\
[and إِلَى الشَّىْءِ] and ↓ ارتاح [and ارتاح بِهِ] (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
was, or became, brisk, lively, &amp;c, as above, at<br>\
the thing, [or betook himself with briskness, liveliness, &amp;c., to the thing,] and was rejoiced by it.<br>\
(Lth, TA.) A poet says,<br>\
وَ زَعَمْتَ أَنَّكَ لَا تَرَاحُ إِلَى النِّسَا<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  And thou assertedst that thou dost not, or wilt<br>\
not, betake thyself with briskness, &amp;c., to women,<br>\
nor be rejoiced by them]. (Lth, TA.) And راح<br>\
لِلْأَمْرِ i. q. ↓ ارتاح [He betook himself with briskness, &amp;c., to the thing, or affair; or was brisk,<br>\

K,) and إِلَيْهِ, (L,) aor. يَرَاحٌ, inf. n. رَوَاحٌ and رُؤُوحٌ<br>\
and رَاحٌ and رِيَاحَةٌ (L, K) and رَاحَةٌ and أَرْيَحِيَّةٌ,<br>\
(L,) (assumed tropical:)  He brightened in countenance at that<br>\
thing, (L, [there explained by أَشْرَقَ لَهُ, and this<br>\
I regard as the right reading, rather than that<br>\
which I find in the copies of the K, which is<br>\
أَشْرَفَ لَهُ, perhaps meaning the same as أَشْرَفَ عَلَيْهِ,<br>\
i. e. he became acquainted with that thing, or<br>\
knew it, syn. اِطَّلَعَ عَلَيْهِ,]) and rejoiced in it, or<br>\
at it, (L, K,) and was thereby affected with<br>\
alacrity, cheerfulness, briskness, liveliness, or<br>\
sprightliness, disposing him to promptness in acts<br>\
of kindness or beneficence: said of a generous<br>\
man when he is asked to confer a gift; and sometimes, metaphorically, of dogs when called by<br>\
their owner, and of other animals. (L.) [It is<br>\
also said that] رَوَاحٌ and رَوَاحَةٌ and رَاحَةٌ and رَوْحَةٌ<br>\
and رَوِيحَةٌ [all app. inf. ns. of رَاحَ, or some of<br>\
them may be simple substs.,] and مُرَايَحَةٌ [as<br>\
though inf. n. of ↓ رَايَحَ] (L, K) signify (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
experiencing relief from grief or sorrow, after<br>\
suffering therefrom: (L:) or the experiencing<br>\
the joy, or happiness, arising from certainty.<br>\
(K. [See also رَوْحٌ, below.]) You say also,<br>\
إِلَى حَدِيثِهِ ↓ اِسْتَرْوَحْتُ [app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  I was<br>\
affected with cheerfulness, liveliness, or the like,<br>\
at his discourse, or narration; as seems to be<br>\
indicated by the context in the place where it is<br>\
mentioned: or perhaps, he trusted to his discourse,<br>\
and became quiet, or easy, in mind; agreeably<br>\
with an explanation of the verb which see below]:<br>\
(A:) or الى حديثه ↓ استراح (assumed tropical:)  he inclined to his<br>\
discourse. (MA.) And راح لِلْمَعْرُوفِ, (S, A, L,<br>\
K,) sec. pers. رِحْتَ, (L,) aor. يَرَاحُ, inf. n. رَاحَةٌ<br>\
(S, L, K) and رِيحٌ; (L;) and له ↓ ارتاح; (A, L;)<br>\
(tropical:)  He was affected with alacrity, cheerfulness,<br>\
briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness, disposing him<br>\
to promptness to do what was kind or beneficent:<br>\
(As, S, L, K:) he inclined to, and loved, kindness<br>\
or beneficence. (L.) And لِلنَّدَى ↓ ارتاح (assumed tropical:)  [He<br>\
was affected with alacrity, &amp;c., and so disposed<br>\
to bounty or liberality]. (S, K.) And نَزَلَتْ<br>\
اللّٰهُ بِرَحْمَتِهِ فَأَنْقَذَهُ مِنْهَا ↓ بِهِ بَلِيَّةٌ فَارْتَاحَ (tropical:)  [A trial,<br>\
or an affliction, befell him, and God was active<br>\
and prompt with his mercy, and delivered him<br>\
from it]: (T:) but ISd disapproves of thus<br>\
speaking of God; and El-Fárisee says that it is<br>\
an instance of the rudeness of speech characteristic of Arabs of the desert. (TA.) [Hence<br>\
seems to have originated, as is app. implied in<br>\
the TA, the assertion that] ↓ الاِرْتِيَاحُ signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The being merciful: and اللّٰهُ لَهُ بِرَحْمَتِهِ ↓ ارتاح,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  God delivered him from trial, or affliction:<br>\
(K:) or اللّٰهُ لِفُلَانٍ ↓ ارتاح (assumed tropical:)  God was merciful to<br>\
such a one. (S.) One also says, راحت يَدُهُ لِكَذَا,<br>\
(K,) or بِكَذَا, (S L,) (tropical:)  His hand was active,<br>\
prompt, or quick, (S, L, K, TA,) to do such a<br>\
thing, (K, TA,) or with such a thing; (S, L, TA;)<br>\
as, for instance, with a sword, to strike with it.<br>\
(L.) Hence the saying of the Prophet, مَنْ رَاحَ<br>\
إِلَى الجُمُعَةِ فِى السَّاعَةِ الأُولَى فَكَأَنَّمَا قَدَّمَ بَدَنَةً<br>\
(tropical:)  [Whosoever is brisk, or prompt, or quick, in<br>\
repairing to the Friday-prayers in the first<br>\
hour, he is as though he offered a camel, or a<br>\
cow or bull, for sacrifice at Mekkeh]: (K, * TA:)<br>\
the meaning is, خَفَّ إِلَيْهَا, (K, TA,) and مَضَى;<br>\
(TA;) not the going in the latter part of the<br>\
day. (K, * TA.) [See also what follows.] ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
رَاحَ, aor. يَرُوحُ, inf. n. رَوَاحٌ; and ↓ تروّح; both<br>\
signify the same; (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.;) contr. of<br>\
غَدَا; (S;) said of a man, (TA,) and of a company<br>\
of men, (K, TA,) He, and they, went, or journeyed, or worked, or did a thing, in the evening,<br>\
(K, TA,) or in the afternoon, i. e., from the<br>\
declining of the sun from the meridian until<br>\
night: (IF, Msb, K, TA:) this is said to be the<br>\
primary meaning: (TA:) but they also mean he,<br>\
or they, returned: (Msb:) and went, or journeyed, at any time: (Msb, * TA:) [for] الرَّوَاحُ is<br>\
not, as some imagine it to be, only [the going, or<br>\
journeying,] in the last, or latter, part of the<br>\
day; but is used by the Arabs as meaning the<br>\
going, or journeying, at any time of the night or<br>\
day; as also الغُدُوُّ: so say Az and others: (Msb:)<br>\
or راح, inf. n. رَوَاحٌ, signifies he came, or went,<br>\
after the declining of the sun from the meridian:<br>\
but is sometimes used as meaning he went in an<br>\
absolute sense: (Mgh:) and thus it means in the<br>\
trad. commencing مَنْ رَاحَ إِلَى الجُمُعَةِ [mentioned above, where a different explanation of<br>\
the verb is given]: (Mgh, * Msb:) and [in like<br>\
manner] one says to his companion or companions, ↓ تَرَوَّحْ or تَرَوَّحُوا as meaning Go, or<br>\
journey: (TA:) but رَاحَتِ الإِبِلُ, (S, L, K,) aor.<br>\
تَرُوحُ and تَرَاحُ, inf. n. رَوَاحٌ (L) and رَائِحَةٌ, (AZ,<br>\
L, K,) signifies only The camels returned in the<br>\
evening, or afternoon, (S, * Msb,) when their<br>\
pastors drove or brought them back to their<br>\
owners: so says Az. (Msb.) You say, رُحْتُ<br>\
إِلَيْهِمْ and عِنْدَهُمْ, inf. n. رَوْحٌ and رَوَاحٌ, I went,<br>\
(K, TA,) and I came, (TA,) to them in the<br>\
evening, or afternoon; [or at any time, as appears<br>\
from what has been said above;] and so رُحْتُهُمْ,<br>\
(K, TA,) inf. n. رَوْحٌ; (TA;) and ↓ رَوَّحْتُهُمْ, (K,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. تَرْوِيحٌ; (TA;) and ↓ تَرَوَّحْتُهُمْ: (K,<br>\
TA:) and ↓ أَنَا أُغَادِيهِ وَ أُرَاوِحُهُ [I go, or come, to<br>\
him early in the morning, in the first part of the<br>\
day, or between the time of the prayer of daybreak and sunrise, and I go, or come, to him in<br>\
the evening, or afternoon, app. he doing the like<br>\
to me]. (A. [See also 6.]) And رَاحَتْ عَلَيْهِ إِبِلُهُ,<br>\
and غَنَمُهُ, and مَالُهُ, His camels, and his sheep or<br>\
goats, and his cattle, returned to him after the<br>\
declining of the sun from the meridian; only at<br>\
that time: and ↓ اراحت may perhaps be a dial.<br>\
var. thereof: (L, TA:) or راحت بِالعَشِىِّ عَلَى أَهْلِهَا<br>\
they (i. e. camels) returned from the place of<br>\
pasture in the evening, or afternoon, to their<br>\
owners. (S, * Msb.) ―<br>\
-b6-  راح الشَّجَرُ, (S, A, K,)<br>\
aor. يَزَاحُ; (S, A;) and ↓ تروّح; (S, A;) [said in<br>\
the TA to be tropical, but not so in the A;] The<br>\
trees broke forth with leaves: (S, A, K:) or the<br>\
former, the trees broke forth with leaves before<br>\
the winter, when the night became cold, without<br>\
rain; (As, TA;) and so the latter: (L:) or the<br>\
latter, the trees broke forth with leaves after the<br>\
close of the صَيْف [or summer]: (S, TA:) and<br>\
الغُصْنُ ↓ تروّح The branch put forth leaves after<br>\
other leaves had fallen from it. (R, TA.) [See<br>\
another meaning of راح الشجر near the beginning<br>\
of this art.] ―<br>\
-b7-  راح, (S, K,) aor. يَرَاحُ, inf. n.<br>\
رَاحَةٌ, (S,) said of a horse, [perhaps from the same<br>\
verb as signifying “ he was, or became, brisk,<br>\
lively,” &amp;c.,] He became a stallion, or fit to cover.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  رَاحَتْهُ الرِّيحُ, aor. تَرَاحُ, The wind smote<br>\
it; namely, a thing; (L, K;) as, for instance,<br>\
a tree, and said of a tempestuous wind. (L.)<br>\
And رِيحَ, said of a pool of water left by a torrent,<br>\
It was smitten [or blown upon] by the wind.<br>\
(S, A, K.) In like manner also it is said of other<br>\
things. (TA.) One says, رِيحَتِ الشَّجَرَةُ The tree<br>\
was blown upon by the wind: or was blown about,<br>\
or shaken, by the wind, so that its leaves were<br>\
made to fall: or had the dust scattered upon it by<br>\
the wind. (L.) And رِيحُوا They (a people, or<br>\
party,) were smitten and destroyed by the wind:<br>\
(K, TA:) or they entered upon [a time of] wind;<br>\
(K;) as also, in this latter sense, ↓ أَرَاحُوا, (S, K,)<br>\
or ↓ أَرْوَحُوا. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  راح الشَّىْءَ, (A &#39;Obeyd, S,<br>\
K,) first pers. رِحْتُ, (A &#39;Obeyd, S,) aor. يَرَاحُ<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S, K,) and يَرِيحُ, (AA, S, K,) [inf. n.,<br>\
app., of the former رَوْحٌ and of the latter رِيحٌ<br>\
as in the phrase of similar meaning following;]<br>\
and ↓ أَرَاحَهُ, (Ks, S, K,) and ↓ أَرْوَحَهُ; (AZ, K;)<br>\
He smelt the thing; perceived its smell, or odour;<br>\
(S, K, &amp;c.;) as also ↓ استراحهُ and ↓ اِسْتَرْوَحَهُ:<br>\

object of the chase, ↓ أَرَاحَنِى, (S,) and ↓ أَرْوَحَنِى,<br>\
(AZ, S, A,) inf. n. of the latter إِرْوَاحٌ, (AZ, TA,)<br>\
He smelt me; perceived my smell, or odour:<br>\
(AZ, S, A, TA:) and of the same, ↓ اراح, (K,)<br>\

smell, or odour: (T, S, K:) and the second of these<br>\

of a thing: (K, TA:) or the third and fourth of<br>\
the same, he smelt, or perceived, odour: (A:)<br>\
and these two, said of a stallion, he perceived the<br>\
smell of the female: and of a beast of prey you<br>\
say, الرِّيحَ ↓ أَرْوَحَ, and ↓ أَرَاحَهَا, and ↓ استراحها,<br>\
and ↓ اِسْتَرْوَحَهَا, meaning he smelt, or perceived,<br>\
the odour; and accord. to Lh, some say, رَاحَهَا;<br>\
but this is seldom used. (TA) [It is asserted<br>\
(in Har p. 324) that ↓ استراح is only from الرَّاحَةُ;<br>\
but this assertion is of no weight against the<br>\
authorities cited above.] It is said in a trad.,<br>\
مَنْ قَتَلَ نَفْسًا مُعَاهِدَةً لَمْ يَرَحٌ رَائِحَةَ الجَنَّةِ,<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S, Mgh, * Msb, *) or لم يَرِحْ, (AA, S,<br>\

peace, (or, as in&#39; the TA, مُؤْمِنًا, i. e. a believer,)]<br>\

(S, Mgh, Msb:) As says, I know not whether it<br>\
be from رِحْتُ or from أَرَحْتُ. (S.) You say also,<br>\

for its objects camels, and sheeep or goats: see<br>\

the first paragraph.<br>\

of the paragraph. ―<br>\

or بَيْنَ العَمَلَيْنِ, (Mgh, K,) signifies The doing the<br>\
two deeds, or works, alternately; this one time,<br>\
and that one time: (S, Mgh, K:) as, for instance,<br>\
reading, or reciting, at one time, and writing at<br>\
another time: (Mgh:) and المراوحة بين الرِّجْلَيْنِ<br>\
the standing upon the two legs alternately; upon<br>\
each in turn: and المراوحة بين الجَنْبَيْنِ the<br>\

from side to side. (K.) You say, راوح بَيْنَ عَمَلَيْنِ<br>\
[He did two deeds, or works, alternately; he<br>\
alternated them]. (A.) And راوح بَيْنَ رِجْلَيْهِ He<br>\
stood upon one of his legs one time and upon the<br>\
other another time: (S, Mgh:) it is said also of<br>\
one walking [as meaning he moved his legs alternately]. (A.) And it is said in a trad., كَانَ<br>\
يُرَاوِحُ بَيْنَ قَدَمَيْهِ مِنْ طُولِ القِيَامِ He used to rest<br>\
upon one of his feet one time and upon the other<br>\
another time to give relief to each of them [in<br>\
consequence of long standing]. (TA.) One says<br>\
also, راوحهُ He did a thing with him by turns,<br>\
each of them taking his turn [and so relieving the<br>\
other: for المُرَاوَحَةُ signifies the giving mutual<br>\
relief, or rest]. (TA in art. عقب.) [See also 6.]<br>\
-A2-  رَايَحَ, inf. n. مُرَايَحَةٌ: see 1, in the former part<br>\
of the paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
اراح He breathed: (S, A, K:) said of a<br>\
man, (A,) and of a horse. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It emitted an<br>\
odour:] it (a thing, Msb) stank; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
as also أَرْوَحَ: (Msb, TA:) the former said of<br>\
flesh-meat, (S, K,) and of water; (K;) and so<br>\

said of flesh-meat, (Lh, M, A, * Msb,) and of<br>\

does also J,] said of water. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also,<br>\
(inf. n. إِرَاحَةٌ, L,) He (a man, S, and a beast, Lh)<br>\
revived, or his spirit returned to him, after<br>\
fatigue; (Lh, S, K;) like ↓ استراح, q. v.: (TA:)<br>\

-b4-  And [hence], (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. إِرَاحَةٌ, (TA,) or إِرْوَاحٌ, (Msb,) (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
(a man) died; (S, Msb, K;) as though he found<br>\

You say, أَرَاحَ فَأَرَاحَ [He rested, i. e. had rest, and<br>\
so rested others], meaning (assumed tropical:)  he died, and so people<br>\
became at rest from him. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence also,]<br>\
أَرَحْنَا بِالصَّلَاةِ We performed the act of prayer:<br>\
because its performance is [a cause of] rest to the<br>\
soul; the waiting for the time thereof being<br>\
troublesome. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b6-  أَرَاحَتْ said of camels<br>\

اراحهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِرَاحَةٌ, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
and ↓ رَاحَةٌ is a subst. used as an inf. n., [i. e. a<br>\

of أَطَاعَهُ and أَعَارَهُ, (TA,) said of God, (S, K,) or<br>\
of a man, (A, Msb,) He rested him, made him to<br>\
be at rest or at ease, or gave him rest; (S, * A, *<br>\
Msb;) namely, a hired man, (Msb,) or any man;<br>\
as also عَنْهُ ↓ روّح: (TA:) and the former, He<br>\
(God) caused him to enter into a state of rest,<br>\
(K, TA,) or of mercy. (TA.) And بِنَا ↓ رَوِّحُوا<br>\
(K in art. لث) Give ye us rest. (TK in that art.)<br>\
And اراح بَعِيرَهُ He revived, or recovered, his<br>\
camel. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] اراح النَّاسَ بِالصَّلَاةِ<br>\
He chanted the call to prayer, and so made the<br>\
people to ease their hearts by performing the act<br>\
of prayer. (L.) ―<br>\

inf. n. إِرَاحَةٌ; (M, Mgh;) accord. to one dial.,<br>\
هَرَاحَ, aor. يُهَرِيحُ; (TA;) and ↓ روّح, (S, * A, TA,)<br>\

she was [as though she were] a مُرَاح for his<br>\
bounty. (L.)<br>\

تروّح بِمِرْوَحَةٍ [He fanned himself with a fan].<br>\
(S, Msb, K.) رَأَيْتُهُمْ يَتَرَوَّحُونَ فِى الضُّحَى, occurring in a trad., means I saw them requiring the<br>\
being fanned with the fan (التَّرْوِيح بِالمِرْوَحَة) by<br>\
reason of the heat [in the morning after sunrise]:<br>\
or it may mean returning to their tents or houses:<br>\
or seeking rest. (TA.) ―<br>\

-b6-  تروّح said of herbage, It<br>\
became tall: (S, K:) and in like manner said of<br>\

to be an inf. n., of which the verb is تَرَيَّحَ: see<br>\
أَرْيَحِيَّةٌ.<br>\
6<br>\

syn. تَعَاقَبَاهُ. (K, TA.) And تراوحوا أَمْرًا They<br>\

[Hence,] إِنَّ يَدَيْهِ لَتَتَرَاوَحَانِ بِالمَعْرُوفِ (S, A *)<br>\
[in the S, the context implies that the meaning is,<br>\
Verily his two hands are occupied alternately in<br>\
doing that which is kind, or beneficent: in the A,<br>\
it is said to be tropical, and the context seems to<br>\
indicate that the meaning is, (tropical:)  his two hands vie,<br>\

-A2-  استروح المَطَرُ الشَّجَرَ<br>\
The rain revived the trees. (L.)<br>\
رَاحٌ Windy; applied to a day: (TA:) or, so<br>\
applied, violently-windy; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ رَائِحٌ, which is the original form, (Msb,) or<br>\
may be so: (TA:) fem. of the former with ة,<br>\
applied to a night (لَيْلَةٌ). (A, TA.) [See also<br>\
رَيِّحٌ.] One says, هٰذِهِ لَيْلَةٌ رَاحَةٌ لِلْمَكْرُوبِ فِيهَا رَاحَةٌ<br>\
[This is a windy night: the oppressed in mind<br>\
has rest therein]. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also syn. with<br>\
اِرْتِيَاحٌ. (S, L, K. [See 1, near the beginning of<br>\
the paragraph.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,] Wine; (S, A, *<br>\
K;) as also ↓ رَيَاحٌ: (S, K:) so called because<br>\
the drinker thereof becomes brisk, lively, or<br>\
sprightly; or, accord. to IHsh, because he<br>\
becomes affected with briskness, liveliness, or<br>\
sprightliness, disposing him to generous actions:<br>\
in the L, [which mentions these two words in<br>\
art. ريح,] the ا in the former word is said to be<br>\
substituted for ى [and hence the ى in the latter<br>\
if such be the case]. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also رَاحَةٌ, in<br>\
four places.<br>\
رَوْحٌ, as an epithet; fem. with ة: see رَيِّحٌ, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also A gentle wind; a gentle<br>\
gale; a breeze; the commencement of a wind<br>\
before it becomes strong; or the breath of the<br>\
wind when weak: (S, K, TA:) or the cold, or<br>\
coolness, of such gentle wind. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  I. q.<br>\
نفس [app. نَفَسٌ i. e. Breath; like رُوحٌ]: said to<br>\
be the primary signification: (MF:) or spirit;<br>\
[like رُوحٌ;] syn. نَفْسٌ; as in the saying, أَحْيَا<br>\
النَّاسَ بِرَوْحِهِ [He (meaning God) hath quickened,<br>\
or vivified, mankind with his spirit: or perhaps<br>\
the right reading is بِرُوحِهِ]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also<br>\
رَاحَةٌ, with which it is syn. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Joy,<br>\
happiness, or gladness; (AA, MF, TA;) said to<br>\
be a metaphorical meaning, from the same word<br>\
as syn. with نفس; (MF;) and ↓ رُوحٌ likewise<br>\
has this meaning: (IAar, TA:) or the former,<br>\
rest, or ease, from grief, or sorrow, of heart.<br>\
(As, TA.) In the saying of &#39;Alee, فَبَاشَرُوا رَوْحَ<br>\
اليَقِينِ or اليقين ↓ رُوحَ, the phrase روح اليقين is<br>\
thought by ISd to mean (assumed tropical:)  The joy and happiness<br>\
that arise from certainty. (TA. [See art. بشر.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Mercy (S, K, TA) of God; thus called<br>\
as being a cause of rest, or ease; (TA;) and so<br>\
↓ رِيحٌ; (K;) and ↓ رَيْحَانٌ; (L;) and ↓ رُوحٌ is<br>\
said by Az to have this meaning in the Kur iv.<br>\
169: the pl. of the first of these three words [and<br>\
of the last, and accord. to some a pl. of the second<br>\
also,] is أَرْوَاحٌ. (TA.)<br>\
رُوحٌ The soul, spirit, or vital principle; syn.<br>\
نَفْسٌ; (IAar, IAmb, L, Msb, TA, and S and K<br>\
&amp;c. in art. نفس; [but there is a difference between<br>\
these two words, for they are not always interchangeable, as I have shown in art. نفس;]) [i. e.]<br>\
مَا بِهِ حَيَاةُ الأَنْفُسِ; (K; [see also رَوْحٌ, third<br>\
sentence;]) often occurring in the Kur and the<br>\
Traditions in different senses, but generally signifying [as explained above, i. e.] the vital principle;<br>\
(IAth, TA;) [or the nervous fluid; or animal<br>\
spirit;] a subtile vaporous substance, which is the<br>\
principle of vitality and of sensation and of<br>\
voluntary motion; also called the رُوح حَيَوَانِىّ;<br>\
(KT in explanation of the term نَفْسٌ;) or a subtile<br>\
body, the source of which is the hollow of the<br>\
corporeal heart, and which diffuses itself into all<br>\
the other parts of the body by means of the<br>\
pulsing veins, or arteries: (KT in explanation of<br>\
the term الرُّوحُ الحَيَوَانِىُّ: [so too نَفْسٌ; q. v.:<br>\
see also Gen. ix. 4: many of the ancients believed<br>\
the soul to reside in the blood: see Aristotle, De<br>\
Anim. i. 2, and Virgil&#39;s Æn. ix. 349:]) or the<br>\
vital principle in man: (Fr, TA:) or the breath<br>\
which a man breathes, and which pervades the<br>\
whole body: [and this seems to be the original<br>\
idea expressed by the word:] after its exit, he<br>\
ceases to breathe; and when it has completely gone<br>\
forth, his eyes remain gazing towards it until<br>\
they close; called in Pers. جَانْ: (AHeyth, TA:)<br>\
accord. to the Sunnees, the rational soul, (النَّفْسُ<br>\
النَّاطِقَةُ, [also termed الرُّوحُ الإِنْسَانِىُّ,]) which is<br>\
adapted to the faculty of making known its ideas<br>\
by means of speech, and of understanding speech,<br>\
and which perishes not with the perishing of the<br>\
body, being a substance, not an accident; as is<br>\
shown by the words in the Kur iii. 163, which<br>\
refer to the روح: (Msb:) most of the doctors of<br>\
the fundamentals of religion forbid the diving into<br>\
this matter, because God has abstained from<br>\
making it known: (TA:) the philosophers say<br>\
that it is the blood, by the exhausting of which<br>\
the life ceases: (Msb:) the word is masc., (IAar,<br>\
IAmb, Az, S, M, A, Msb, K, *) thus, with the<br>\
Arabs, differing from نَفْسٌ, for this they make<br>\
fem., (IAar, IAmb, Msb,) but the former is also<br>\
fem., (S, M, A, Msb, K,) app. as meaning نَفْسٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) as is said in the R; (TA;) and most hold<br>\
it to be as often fem. as it is masc.: (MF:) one<br>\
says خَرَجَ رُوحُهُ (IAar, Az, TA) [and also خَرَجَتْ<br>\
رُوحُهُ, meaning His soul departed, or went forth]:<br>\
the pl. is أَرْوَاحٌ. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q. نَفْخٌ (K)<br>\
[properly A blowing with the mouth; but here]<br>\
meaning wind that issues from the رُوح; (TA;)<br>\
wind, or breath. (ADk, TA.) Dhu-r-Rummeh<br>\
says, respecting fire that he had struck, and upon<br>\
which he bade his companion to blow, أَحْيِهَا بِرُوحِكَ<br>\
Give life to it, or enliven it, with thy wind [or<br>\
breath]. (TA.) And one says, مَلَأَ القِرْبَةَ مِنْ<br>\
رُوحِهِ He filled the skin with his wind; with his<br>\
breath. (ADk, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] الرُّوحُ also<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  Inspiration, or divine revelation; (Zj,<br>\
Th, K;) such as is imparted by means of an<br>\
angel: thus in the Kur xvi. 2 and xl. 15: so<br>\
called because it quickens from the death of<br>\
infidelity, and thus is, to a man, like the رُوح<br>\
which is the vital principle of his body: (T:) or<br>\
(so says Zj accord. to the L, but in the K “ and ” )<br>\
the prophetic commission. (Zj, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
Kur-án; (IAar, Zj, S, * A, * K;) whereby God&#39;s<br>\
creatures are [spiritually] quickened, and guided<br>\
to the right way. (TA.) So in the trad., تَحَايَوْا<br>\
بِذِكْرِ اللّٰهِ وَ رُوحِهِ (tropical:)  [Revive yourselves with God&#39;s<br>\
book of religion and religious laws, (or ذِكْر may<br>\
here have some other meaning,) and his Kur-án].<br>\
(TA. [Mentioned also in the A; in a copy of<br>\
which, in the place of تَحَايَوْا, I find تَحَابُوا, an<br>\
evident mistranscription.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  What God<br>\
ordains and commands (K, TA) by means of his<br>\
assistants and angels. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also Jibreel<br>\
[i. e. Gabriel]; (S, * A, * K;) called in the Kur<br>\
[xxvi. 193] الرُّوحُ الأَمِينُ, and [in ii. 81] رُوحُ<br>\
القُدُسِ or القُدْسِ, as related by Az on the authority of Th. (TA.) [The last of these appellations,<br>\
or generally, but incorrectly, الرُّوحُ القُدُسُ, is<br>\
applied by the Eastern Christians among the<br>\
Arabs to The Holy Spirit; the Third Person<br>\
of the Trinity.] ―<br>\
-b7-  And [sometimes Our Lord]<br>\
Jesus. (S, * A, * K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And A certain angel,<br>\
(I&#39;Ab, K,) in the Seventh Heaven, (I&#39;Ab, TA,)<br>\
whose face is like that of a man, and his body<br>\
like that of the [other] angels: (I&#39;Ab, K:) or<br>\
certain creatures resembling mankind, but not<br>\
men: so in the Kur lxxviii. 38: (Zj:) or the<br>\
watchers over the angels who are watchers over<br>\
the sons of Adam, whose faces are said to be like<br>\
the faces of men, and whom the other angels see<br>\
not, like as we see not the watchers nor the [other]<br>\
angels. (Th.) ―<br>\
-b9-  See also رَوْحٌ, in three places.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also pl. of رَؤُوحٌ: (L:) ―<br>\
-b2-  and of أَرْوَحُ. (S &amp;c.)<br>\
رَوَحٌ: see رَائِحٌ, of which it is said to be a<br>\
quasi-pl. n., in three places.<br>\
-A2-  Also Width, wideness, or ampleness. (S, K.) El-Mutanakhkhil<br>\
[in the TA El-Muntakhal] El-Hudhalee says,<br>\
لٰكِنْ كَبِيرُ بْنُ هِنْدٍ يَوْمَ ذٰلِكُمُ<br>\
فُتْخُ الشَّمَائِلِ فِى أَيْمَانِهِمْ رَوَحُ<br>\
(S, TA,) meaning But Kebeer Ibn-Hind, a tribe<br>\
of Hudheyl, on that day, were lax in the joints<br>\
of the left hands by reason of vehement pulling<br>\
[of the bows], having wideness in their right<br>\
hands by reason of vehement striking with the<br>\
sword. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [particularly] Width, or<br>\
wideness, in the space between the thighs: (TA:)<br>\
or width, or wideness, (S, Mgh, K,) in, (S, K,)<br>\
or of, (Mgh,) [or between,] the two legs, (S,<br>\
Mgh, K,) less than what is termed فَحَجٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
or less than فَجَجٌ, (A, Mgh,) with wideness between the fore parts of the feet, and nearness of<br>\
the heels, each to the other: (S:) or [simply]<br>\
wideness between the fore parts of the feet, and<br>\
nearness of the heels, each to the other: (Msb:)<br>\
or a spreading in the fore part of each foot:<br>\
(Lth, Mgh, Msb:) or a turning over of the foot<br>\
upon its outer side: IAar says that رَوَحٌ in the<br>\
legs is less than فَدَعٌ, and this is less than عَقَلٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  هٰذَا الأَمْرُ بَيْنَنَا رَوَحٌ means This is a<br>\
thing, or an affair, which we do by turns; as<br>\
also عَوَرٌ. (TA.)<br>\
رِيحٌ originally رِوْحٌ, the و being changed into<br>\
ى because of the preceding kesreh, (T, S, Msb,)<br>\
as is shown by its dim. mentioned below; (T,<br>\
Msb;) Sb held it to be of the measure فِعْلٌ; and<br>\
Abu-l-Hasan, فِعْلٌ and فُعْلٌ; [if the latter, originally رُيْحٌ;] (TA;) [Wind; i. e.] the air that is<br>\
made to obey [the will of God] and to run its<br>\
course between heaven and earth: (Msb, TA:) or<br>\
the breath (نَسِيم) of the air; and in like manner, of anything: (L, TA:) said to be thus<br>\
called because it generally brings رَوْح and رَاحَة<br>\
[i. e. rest, or ease]: (IAmb, MF:) one says<br>\
رِيحٌ and ↓ رِيحَةٌ, like دَارٌ and دَارَةٌ; (S;) [using<br>\
the latter as a more special term; for] رِيحَةٌ signifies a portion of wind (طَائِفَةٌ مِنْ رِيحٍ) [meaning<br>\
a wind of short duration; or a breath, puff,<br>\
blast, or gust, of wind]; (Sb, M;) but رِيحٌ and<br>\
↓ رِيحَةٌ may be used in the same sense; i. e. the<br>\
latter may be used as syn. with the former, and<br>\
they are mentioned by some [as analogous] with<br>\
كَوْكَبٌ and كَوْكَبَةٌ: (Sb, L:) رِيْح is of the<br>\
fem. gender (IAmb, L, Msb) in most cases;<br>\
(Msb;) and all the other names for wind are fem.<br>\
except إِعْصَارٌ, which is masc.; (IAmb, Msb;)<br>\
but ريح is sometimes made masc. as meaning<br>\
هَوَآءٌ: (AZ, Msb:) [it is used by physicians as<br>\
signifying flatus, flatuosity, or flatulence; as in<br>\
the phrase رِيحٌ غَلِيظَةٌ a gross flatus:] the pl. [of<br>\
pauc.] is أَرْوَاحٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and أَرْيَاحٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) the latter used by some, but disallowed by AHát because there is in it no kesreh<br>\
to cause the و to be changed into ى, (L, Msb,)<br>\
and [the pl. of mult. is] رِيَاحٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,<br>\
&amp;c.,) with ى because of the kesreh, (Msb,) and<br>\
رِيَحٌ; (K, but not found by SM in any other<br>\
lexicon;) and the pl. pl. is أَرَاوِيحُ [pl. of أَرْوَاحٌ]<br>\
and أَرَايِيحُ [pl. of أَرْيَاحٌ]: (K:) the dim. of رِيحٌ is<br>\
↓ رُوَيْحَةٌ. (T, Msb.) رِيَاحٌ, or another form of pl.,<br>\
is often used in a good sense; and the sing., in an<br>\
evil sense; because the Arabs say that the clouds<br>\
are not made to give rain save by diverse winds<br>\
blowing together; and this distinction is observed<br>\
in the Kur-án. (L.) Hence, it is related in a<br>\
trad., that he [Mohammad] used to say, when<br>\
wind rose, اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْهَا رِيَاحًا وَ لَا تَجْعَلْهَا رِيحًا [O<br>\
God, make it to be winds, and made it not to be<br>\
a wind]. (TA.) [But this distinction is not<br>\
always observed.] One says, فُلَانٌ يَمِيلُ مَعَ كُلِّ<br>\
رِيحٍ (tropical:)  [Such a one inclines, or turns, with every<br>\
wind]. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ كَالرِّيحِ المُرْسَلَةِ [Such<br>\
a one is like the wind that is sent forth to drive<br>\
the clouds, and produce rain; (see the Kur xxv.<br>\
50;)] meaning, (tropical:)  quick, or prompt, to do acts of<br>\
kindness, or beneficence. (A.) And رَجُلٌ سَاكِنُ<br>\
الرِّيحِ (tropical:)  A man who is calm, sedate, staid, or<br>\
grave. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Predominance, or prevalence; and power, or force. (S, K.) A poet<br>\
says, (S,) namely, Suleyk Ibn-Es-Sulakeh, or<br>\
Taäbbata-Sharrà, or Aashà of the tribe of Fahm,<br>\
(TA, and so in one of my copies of the S,)<br>\
أَتَنْظُرَانِ قَلِيلًا رَيْثَ غَفْلَتِهِمْ<br>\
أَوْ تَعْدُوَانِ فَإِنَّ الرِّيحَ لِلْعَادِى<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Will ye two await, a little, the time of their<br>\
inadvertence, or will ye act aggressively? for<br>\
prevalence is for the aggressor]. (S.) And<br>\
hence the phrase in the Kur [viii. 48], وَ تَذْهَبَ<br>\
رِيحُكُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [And your predominance, or power,<br>\
depart]: (S:) [or in this latter instance it has<br>\
the meaning next following.] ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  Aid against an<br>\
enemy; or victory, or conquest: (K, TA:) and<br>\
(tropical:)  a turn of good fortune. (A, K, TA.) One<br>\
says, ذَهَبَتْ رِيحُهُمْ (tropical:)  Their turn of good fortune<br>\
departed. (A.) And إِذَا هَبَّتْ رِيَاحُكَ فَاغْتَنِمْهَا<br>\
(tropical:)  [When thy turns of good fortune come, avail<br>\
thyself of them]. (A.) And الرِّيحُ لِآلِ فُلَانٍ<br>\
(tropical:)  Aid against the enemy, or victory or conquest,<br>\
or the turn of good fortune, is to the family of<br>\
such a one. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also رَوْحٌ. ―<br>\
-b5-  And see<br>\
رَائِحَةٌ (with which it is syn.), in four places. ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
Also (assumed tropical:)  A good, sweet, or pleasant, thing. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  The pl. أَرْوَاحٌ occurs in a trad. as meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  The jinn, or genii; because they are [supposed<br>\
to be often] invisible, like the wind. (TA.)<br>\
رَاحَةٌ Rest, repose, or ease; contr. of تَعَبٌ;<br>\
(TA;) cessation of trouble, or inconvenience, and<br>\
of toil, or fatigue; (Msb;) [or freedom therefrom;] and ↓ رَوْحٌ signifies the same as رَاحَةٌ,<br>\
(S, A, K,) from الاِسْتِرَاحَةُ; (S, A;) like ↓ رَوَاحٌ<br>\
[mentioned in the first paragraph as an inf. n. in<br>\
a similar sense, as are also رَاحَةٌ and ↓ رَوْحَةٌ and<br>\
↓ رَوَاحَةٌ and ↓ رَوِيحَةٌ, i. e., as meaning the experiencing relief from grief &amp;c.]. (TA.) You<br>\
say, ↓ مَا لِفُلَانٍ فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ مِنْ رَوَاحٍ i. e. رَاحَةٍ<br>\
[There is not, for such a one, in this affair, or<br>\
case, or event, any rest, &amp;c.]. (TA.) And اِفْعَلْ<br>\
↓ ذٰلِكَ فِى سَرَاحٍ وَ رَوَاحٍ (tropical:)  Do thou that in a state<br>\
of ease (S, A, K) and rest. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 4,<br>\

set, and men, looking towards it, shield themselves from its rays with the palms of their hands:<br>\

رَيْحَانٌ a word respecting the formation of<br>\

its original form is رَوْيَحَانٌ; (MF;) and others,<br>\

used in medicine]: (Mgh: [see also حَبَقٌ:]) or<br>\
any sweet-smelling plant; (T, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
but when used absolutely by the vulgar, a particular plant [that mentioned above] is meant<br>\
thereby: (Msb:) or the extremities thereof; (K;)<br>\
i. e. the extremities of any sweet-smelling herb,<br>\
when the first of its blossoms come forth upon it:<br>\
(TA:) or the leaves thereof: (K:) or the leaves<br>\
of seed-produce: so, accord. to Fr, in the Kur<br>\
lv. 11: (S, TA:) [it is a coll. gen. n.:] the n. un.<br>\
is with ة; (TA;) and is applied to a bunch<br>\
(طَاقَةٌ) of رَيْحَان; and, with the article ال, (as a<br>\
proper name, TA,) the حَنْوَة [a certain plant<br>\
respecting which authors differ]: (K:) the dim.<br>\
of رَيْحَانٌ is رُوَيْحِينٌ: (Msb:) and the pl. is<br>\
رَيَاحِينُ. (Mgh, Msb) رَيْحَانُ الحَبَاحِمِ: and<br>\
رَيْحَانُ الشُّيُوخِ: see حَبَقٌ. رَيْحَانُ القُبُورِ is a name<br>\

-b2-  (tropical:)  Offspring; (L, K, TA;) from the<br>\

n. un. with ة; whence,] رِيْحَانَنَىَّ [meaning (tropical:)  My<br>\
two descendants] occurs in a saying of Mohammad as applied to El-Hasan and El-Hoseyn.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  A bounty, or gift, of God; such as<br>\
the means of subsistence, &amp;c.; syn. رِزْقٌ: (S, L,<br>\

(tropical:)  [I went forth seeking, or seeking diligently, the<br>\
bounty, &amp;c., of God]. (AO, S, TA.) And in a<br>\
verse of En-Nemir Ibn-Towlab cited voce دِرَّةٌ.<br>\
(S, TA.) And in the saying, in a trad., الوَلَدُ مِنْ<br>\
رَيْحَانِ اللّٰهِ (tropical:)  [Offspring are of the bounty of God].<br>\

-b4-  It is also used (S, K) in the accus.<br>\
case as an inf. n. [forming an absolute complement of a verb understood], (S,) in the sense of<br>\
اِسْتِرْزَاق: so in the saying, سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ وَ رَيْحَانَهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [I extol, or celebrate, or declare, the absolute<br>\
perfection, or glory, or purity, of God, and beg<br>\
his bounty, or his supply of the means of subsistence]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also رَوْحٌ.<br>\
رَوْحَانِىٌّ, with fet-h to the ر, applied to a place,<br>\
Good, or pleasant [app., like رَيِّحٌ, in respect of<br>\
wind or air]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\

follows.<br>\
رُوحَانِىٌّ, with damm to the ر, (S, A, K, &amp;c.,)<br>\
and ↓ رَوْحَانِىٌّ, with fet-h, but this latter is deemed<br>\
strange by the lexicologists [as syn. with the<br>\
former], (MF,) app. rel. ns., from رَوحٌ [in the<br>\
former instance], or from رَوْحٌ meaning the<br>\
“ breath of the wind when weak ” [in the latter<br>\
instance], extraordinary in form, with ا and ن<br>\
added to the usual form of the rel. n.: (TA:)<br>\
Of, or relating to, the angels and the jinn or<br>\
genii: (S, A, * K:) in this sense Abu-l-Khattáb<br>\
asserts himself to have heard the former used:<br>\
(S:) accord. to AO, it is applied by the Arabs to<br>\
anything having in it a soul, or spirit, (Sb, S,)<br>\
whether a human being or a beast: (Sb:) or it<br>\
has this signification also: (K:) accord. to Wardán Aboo-Khálid, as related by ISh, among the<br>\
angles are those who are termed رُوحَانِيُّونَ, and<br>\
those who are created of light; and of the former<br>\
are Jibreel and Meekáeel and Isráfeel: and ISh<br>\
adds that the روحانيّون are souls, or spirits, which<br>\
have not bodies; [spiritual beings;] and that the<br>\
term روحانىّ is not applied to anything save what<br>\
is of this description, such as the angles and the<br>\
jinn and the like: and this is the correct explanation; not that of Ibn-El-Mudhaffar, that it signifies that into which, a soul, or spirit, has been<br>\
blown. (T, TA.)<br>\
الحَبَقُ الرَّيْحَانِىُّ: see حَبَقٌ.<br>\

afternoon]. (TA.) And ↓ لَقِيتُهُ رَائِحَةً I met him<br>\
in the evening, or afternoon. (A.) And خَرَجْوا<br>\

مَكَانٌ رَيِّحٌ a place of good, or pleasant, wind:<br>\
(S: [see also رَوْحَانِىٌّ:]) or, accord. to Lth, (TA,)<br>\
and the Kifáyet el-Mutahaffidh, (Msb,) يَوْمٌ رَيِّحٌ<br>\
signifies a violently-windy day; like يَوْمٌ رَاحٌ<br>\
[before mentioned]. (Mgh, Msb, TA.)<br>\
رَيِّحَةٌ and ↓ رِيحَةٌ A certain plant that appears<br>\
at the roots, or lower parts, of the عِضَاه, remaining from the preceding year: or what grows when<br>\
affected by the cold, without rain: (K:) in the<br>\
T, the former is expl. as signifying a plant that<br>\
becomes green after its leaves and the upper parts<br>\
of its branches have dried: (TA: [see also رَبْلٌ:])<br>\
this term is applied to the حُلَّب, the نَصِىّ, the<br>\
رُخَامَى, and the مَكْنَان. (TA in art. حلب.)<br>\

[or journeying, or working, or doing a thing,<br>\
(see its verb, 1,)] in the evening, or in the afternoon: (L:) [and going, or journeying, at any<br>\

(L:) ↓ رَوَحٌ is pl., (S, K,) or [rather] a quasi-pl.<br>\
n., (L,) of رَائِحٌ, (S, L, K,) like as خَدَمٌ is of<br>\
خَادِمٌ. (S, L.) قَوْمُكَ رَائِحٌ [Thy people, or party,<br>\
are, or is, going, &amp;c.] is a phrase of the Arabs<br>\
mentioned by Lh on the authority of Ks; but he<br>\
says that it is only used thus, with a determinate<br>\
noun; i. e., that one does not say قَوْمٌ رَائِحٌ [though<br>\
this is agreeable with analogy, as well as قَوْمٌ<br>\
رَائِحَةٌ and قَوْمٌ رَائِحُونَ]: one says also ↓ قَوْمٌ رَوَحٌ<br>\
and رُوحٌ. (L, TA.) And one says إِبِلٌ رَائِحَةٌ<br>\
Camels returning in the evening, or afternoon,<br>\
from pasture. (Msb.) [Hence,] مَا لَهُ سَارِحَةٌ وَ لَا<br>\
رَائِحَةٌ [lit. He has not any camels, &amp;c., that go<br>\
away to pasture, nor any that return from pasture], meaning (assumed tropical:)  he has not anything: (S:) and<br>\
sometimes it means (assumed tropical:)  he has not any people, or<br>\
party. (Lh, TA in art. سرح.) أَعْطَانِى<br>\
رَائِحَةٍ زَوْجًا occurs in a trad. as meaning He gave<br>\
me, of every kind of cattle that returned to him<br>\
from pasture, a portion, or sort: and in another,<br>\
مَالٌ رَائِحٌ, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Property, or cattle,]<br>\
of which the profit and recompense return to one:<br>\
or in each, as some relate it, the word is with ب<br>\
[i. e. رَابِحَة and رَابِح]. (TA.) ↓ طَيْرٌ رَوَحٌ means<br>\
Birds in a state of dispersion: or returning in<br>\
the evening, or afternoon, (S, K,) to their places,<br>\
(S,) or to their nests: (K:) or, accord. to the T,<br>\
رَوَحٌ in this case is for رَوَحَةٌ, [a pl. of رَائِحٌ,] like<br>\
كَفَرَةٌ and فَجَرَةٌ, [pls. of كَافِرٌ and فَاجِرٌ,] and<br>\
means, in this instance, in a state of dispersion.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, [used as a subst., or an epithet in<br>\
which the quality of a subst. is predominant,] A<br>\

عَلَى سَرَاةِ رَائِحٍ مَمْطُورِ<br>\
i. e. [I put my plaited thongs, and the curved<br>\
pieces of wood, or the cover, of the camel&#39;s saddle,<br>\
upon the back of (a camel like)] a wild bull<br>\
rained upon; for when he is rained upon, he<br>\
runs vehemently: (S, TA:) but the reading commonly known is,<br>\
بَلْ خِلْتُ أَعْلَاقِى وَ جُِلْبَ كُورِ<br>\
[Nay, or nay rather, I fancied my bags for<br>\
travelling-provisions &amp;c. that were hung upon<br>\
my camel, and the curved pieces of wood of my<br>\
camel&#39;s saddle]. (IB, TA in art. جلب. [اعلاقى<br>\
is there explained as meaning “ my things that I<br>\
held in high estimation: ” but the rendering that<br>\
I have given I consider preferable.])<br>\
رَائِحَةٌ [fem. of رَائِحٌ, used as a subst.,] and ↓ رِيحٌ<br>\
both signify the same; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) i. e.<br>\
An accidental property or quality that is perceived by the sense of smelling; [or rather an<br>\
exhalation that is so perceived; meaning odour,<br>\
scent, or smell;] (Mgh, Msb;) syn. نَسِيمٌ; whether<br>\
sweet or stinking: (K:) and the former, a sweet<br>\
odour which one perceives in the نَسِيم [or breath<br>\
of the wind]: (L:) ↓ the latter is fem. [like the<br>\
former]: (Msb:) the pl. of the former is رَوَائِحُ;<br>\
and El-Hulwánee mentions أَرَايِيحُ as pl. of أَرْيَاحٌ<br>\
[which is pl. of ↓ رِيحٌ, under which see its other<br>\
pls.]. (Mgh.) You say, الشَّىْءِ ↓ وَجَدْتُ رِيحَ<br>\
and رَائِحَتَهُ in the same sense [i. e. I perceived<br>\
the odour of the thing]. (S.) And لِهٰذِهِ البَقْلَةِ<br>\
رَائِحَةٌ طَيِّبَةٌ [This herb, or leguminous plant, has<br>\
a sweet odour]. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in the K, that<br>\
مَا فِى وَجْهِهِ رَائِحَةٌ means (tropical:)  There is not in his<br>\
face any blood: but [SM says that] this requires<br>\
consideration; for, accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, one says,<br>\
أَتَانَا فُلَانٌ وَ مَا فِى وَجْهِهِ رَائِحَةُ دَمٍ مِنْ الفَرَقِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Such a one came to us not having in his face<br>\
any tinge of blood by reason of fright, or fear]:<br>\
and accord. to the A [and the Mgh], one says of<br>\
a person who has come in fright, or fear, أَتَانَا<br>\
وَ مَا فِى رَجْهِهِ رَائِحَةُ دَمٍ: (TA:) [accord. to Mtr,<br>\
however,] one sometimes says, وَ مَا فِى وَجْهِهِ رَائِحَةٌ,<br>\
without adding دم; and an instance of this occurs<br>\
in a trad. of Aboo-Jahl. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  رَائِحَةٌ also<br>\
signifies A rain of the evening or afternoon:<br>\
(Lh, K:) or, as Lh says on one occasion, [simply] rain: (TA:) pl. رَوَائِحُ. (Lh, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And]<br>\
A cloud (سَحَابَةٌ) that comes in the evening or<br>\
afternoon. (Har p. 667.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also رَوَاحٌ.<br>\
أَرْوَاحُ [More, and most, conducive to rest or<br>\
ease]. (K in art. مخر.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Having the<br>\
quality termed رَوَحٌ [q. v.] (Lth, A, Mgh, Msb, K)<br>\
in the thighs, (TA,) or in the legs, (S, A, * Mgh, *<br>\
K,) and feet, (S,) or in the feet: (Lth, Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) fem. رَوْحَآءُ: (S, Msb:) and pl. رُوحٌ. (S.)<br>\
Such was &#39;Omar; (K, TA;) appearing as though<br>\
he were riding when others were walking: (TA:)<br>\
and such is every ostrich. (S, TA.) You say also<br>\
قَدَمٌ رَوْحَآءُ, meaning A foot spreading in its fore<br>\
part: (Lth, Mgh, TA:) or turning over upon its<br>\
outer side. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, and ↓ أَرْيَحُ, (K,) or<br>\
the latter only is correct in this case, (TA,) Wide;<br>\
applied to a مَحْمِل [q. v.]: (K, TA:) and so the<br>\
latter applied to anything: (Lth, TA:) so too<br>\
the former applied to a [bowl such as is termed]<br>\
قَدَح: and the same also signifies shallow; applied<br>\
to a vessel: (TA:) and so رَوْحَآءُ; applied to a<br>\
[bowl such as is termed] قَصْعَة. (S, A, K.)<br>\
أَرْيَحُ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
أَرْيَحِىٌّ (tropical:)  Large, or liberal, in disposition; (S,<br>\
K, TA;) characterized by alacrity, cheerfulness,<br>\
briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness, disposing him<br>\
to promptness in acts of liberality, kindness, or<br>\
beneficence: (S, * A, L, K: *) the former ى is said<br>\
by AAF to be substituted for و: (TA. Mentioned<br>\
in the L in the present art. and in art. ريح.) The<br>\
Arabs have many epithets like this, [as أَجْوَلِىٌّ<br>\
and أَحْوَذِىٌّ and أَحْوَزِىٌّ and أَلْمَعِىٌّ,] of the meansure أَفْعَلِىٌّ, as though they were rel. ns. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  It is also an epithet applied to a sword, meaning (assumed tropical:)  That shakes, (TA, and Ham p. 358,) as<br>\
though brisk, or prompt, to strike: (Ham:) or<br>\
meaning of Aryah, a town of Syria, (TA and<br>\
Ham, [in the latter of which the phrase سُيُوفَ<br>\
أَرْيَحَ is cited in confirmation from a poem of Sakhr<br>\
el-Ghei,]) or a tribe of El-Yemen. (TA.)<br>\
أَرْيَحِيَّةٌ (tropical:)  Largeness, or liberality, of disposition;<br>\
(S, K, TA;) alacrity, cheerfulness, briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness, disposing one to promptness<br>\
in acts of liberality, kindness, or beneficence:<br>\
(S, * A, L, K: *) the former ى is said by AAF to<br>\
be substituted for و: (TA:) ↓ تَرَيُّحٌ, accord. to Lh,<br>\
signifies the same, and ISd thinks it to be an inf. n.,<br>\
of which the verb is تَرَيَّحَ. (L: in which these two<br>\
ns. are mentioned in the present art. and in art.<br>\
ريح. [See also رَاحٌ: and see 1.]) You say,<br>\
أَخَذَتْهُ الأَرْيَحِيَّةُ, (S, L, K,) or أَرْيَحِيَّةٌ إِلَى النَّدَى,<br>\
(A,) i. e. (tropical:)  Alacrity, cheerfulness, &amp;c., disposing<br>\

تَرْوِيحَةٌ A single rest: pl. تَرَاوِيحُ. (Mgh, *<br>\

prayer performed at some period of the night in<br>\
the month of Ramadán, after the ordinary<br>\
prayer of nightfall, consisting of twenty, or more,<br>\

(Mgh, * Msb, TA;) so called because the per<br>\
former rests after each ترويحة, which consists of<br>\
four rek&#39;ahs; (Mgh, * Msb, K, * TA;) or because<br>\
