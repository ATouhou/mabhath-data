أُرْجُوحَةٌ (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ مَرْجُوحَةٌ, both<br>\
signify the same, (Msb, K, TA,) but the latter is<br>\
disapproved by the author of the “ Bári&#39;; ” (Msb,<br>\
TA;) A seesaw; i. e. a piece of wood [or a<br>\
plank] the middle of which is placed upon a heap<br>\
of earth or the like, then a boy sits upon one end<br>\
of it and another boy upon its other end, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) and it moves up and down with them:<br>\
thus explained in the &#39;Eyn and its Abridgment,<br>\
and in the Jámi&#39; of Kz, and thus Th says on the<br>\
authority of IAar: (TA:) [accord. to the CK<br>\
and some MS. copies of the K, these two words<br>\
signify the same as رُجَّاحَةٌ; but accord. to other<br>\

Hasan understands not how a pl. word can be<br>\
thus explained by a sing. word: (TA: [but an<br>\
inf. n., such as is here used, is often used in explanation of a sing. and of a dual and of a pl.])<br>\
مِرْجَحٌ: see رَجَاحٌ.<br>\
