Msb, K, &amp;c.,) for which some say رَيْتُ, without ء, (T, S, M,) but the former is that which is<br>\
general and preferred, (T, M,) aor. يَرَى (T, S,<br>\

said by none except [the tribe of] Teym-erRibáb, (T, M,) or by such as require this form<br>\
in poetry, (S,) sec. pers. fem. sing. and pl., alike,<br>\
تَرَيْنَ, so that you say تَرَيْنَنِى [with an affixed<br>\
pronoun], and if you will you may say تَرَيْنِّى,<br>\
incorporating one ن into the other by teshdeed,<br>\
(S,) imperative رَ and إِرْءَ (AZ, T, S, M,) the<br>\
people of El-Hijáz saying رَ dual رَيَا, pl. masc.<br>\
رَوْا and fem. رَيْنَ, and Teym saying اِرْءَ &amp;c.,<br>\
(T, M,) inf. n. رُؤْيَةٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and رِيَّةٌ,<br>\
(T, M, K,) the former being altered to رُوْيَةٌ and<br>\
then to رُيَّةٌ and then to رِيَّةٌ, (T, M,) and رَأْىٌ<br>\
(T, S, K) and رَآءَةٌ, (S, M, K, [in the CK رَأَة,])<br>\
like رَاعَةٌ [in measure], (S,) in which the ة is not<br>\
necessarily a restrictive to unity, (M,) and رَايَةٌ<br>\
(K [but this I do not find elsewhere]) and رِئْيَانٌ,<br>\
(Lh, M, TA,) for which last we find in the copies<br>\
of the K رُؤْيَان, (TA,) He saw [a person or<br>\
thing] with the eye: (S:) in this sense the verb<br>\
has [only] one objective complement: (S, Msb:)<br>\
you say, رَأَيْتُهُ (T, M, Msb, K) and ↓ اِستَرْأَيْتُهُ,<br>\
(T, M, K,) for which some say اِسْتَرَيْتُهُ, (T, M,)<br>\
and ↓ اِرْتَأَيْتُهُ, (T, M, K,) for which some say اِرْتَيْتُهُ,<br>\
(T, M,) all signifying the same, (T, M, K,) I<br>\
saw him, or it, (a person and a thing, Msb) with<br>\
the eye; (T, M, Msb, K, TA;) [or so,] and also,<br>\
with the mind. (M and K in relation to the first,<br>\
and K in relation to all.) رُؤْيَةٌ is of several sorts:<br>\
(TA:) first, it signifies The seeing with the eye:<br>\
(M, K, TA:) and with what serves for the same<br>\
purpose as the organ of sight; as in the saying in<br>\
the Kur [ix. 106], وَقُلِ اعْمَلُوا فَسَيَرَىاللّٰهُ عَمَلَكُمْ<br>\
[And Say thou, Work ye, for God will see your<br>\
work]; because the sense of sight cannot be attributed to God: (TA:) [and similar to this is the<br>\
phrase, رَأَى فِيهِ كَذَا He saw in him such a<br>\
thing: and رَأَى مِنْهُ كَذَا He experienced from<br>\
him such a thing.] Secondly, The seeing by supposition, or fancy; as in the saying, أَرَى أَنَّ<br>\
زَيْدًا مُنْطَلِقٌ [I suppose, or fancy, that Zeyd is<br>\
going away]. (TA.) Thirdly, The seeing by reflection, or consideration; as in the saying [in<br>\
the Kur viii. 50], إِنِّى أَرَى مَا لَا تَرَوْنَ [Verily<br>\
I see by reflection, or consideration, what ye see<br>\
not]. (TA.) Fourthly, The seeing with the mind,<br>\
or mentally; [the opining, or judging, a thing;<br>\
a sense in which the inf. n. رَأْىٌ is more commonly used;] (M, * K, * TA;) as in the saying<br>\
in the Kur [liii. 11], مَا كَذَبَ الفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى [The<br>\
heart did not belie what he mentally saw]. (TA.)<br>\
[Of these meanings, other exs. here follow; with<br>\
exs. of similar meanings.] ―<br>\
-b2-  An ex. of رَا for رَأَى<br>\
occurs in the saying of a poet,<br>\
مَنْ رَا مِثْلَ مَعْدَانَ بْنِ َحْيَى<br>\
[Who has seen the like of Maadán the son of<br>\
Yahyà? the measure being وَافِر, with the first<br>\
foot reduced to مُفْعَلْتُنْ]. (M.) الحَمْدُلِلّٰهِ عَلَى<br>\
رِيَّتِكِ, for رُؤْيَتِكَ, altered in the manner explained<br>\
above, [meaning Praise be to God for the seeing<br>\
of thee,] (M, K, *) is a saying mentioned by<br>\
IAar. (M.) صُومُوا لِرُؤْيَتِهِ means [Fast ye] at the<br>\
time of seeing it; [referring to the new moon of<br>\
Ramadán;] i. e., when ye see it. (Mgh.) In the<br>\
phrase رَأَيْتُهُ قَائِمًا [I saw him standing], قائما is<br>\
in the accus. case as a denotative of state. (Msb.)<br>\
رَأْىُ عَيْنِى زَيْدًا فَعَلَ ذَاكَ [My eye saw (lit. my<br>\
eye&#39;s seeing) Zeyd do that] is held by Sb to be an<br>\
instance of an anomalous use of an inf. n., and<br>\
is [said to be] the only instance of the kind,<br>\
among inf. ns. of trans. verbs except سَمْعُ أُذُنِى.<br>\
(M, TA: but in a copy of the former written<br>\
رَأْىَ عينى and سَمْعَاذنى.) رَأَيْتُهُ رَأْىَ العَيْنِ means<br>\
[I saw him, or it,] where the eye, or sight, fell<br>\
upon him, or it. (TA.) بِعَيْنٍ مَّا أَرَيَنَّكَ [lit. With<br>\
some eye I will assuredly see thee] is a saying<br>\
mentioned by AZ as meaning hasten thou, (اِعْجَلْ<br>\
thus in copies of the S and in the TA, or عَجِّلْ as<br>\
in one copy of the S,) or work thou, (اِعْمَلْ, thus<br>\
in two copies of the S,) and be as though I were<br>\
looking at thee: (S, TA:) it is said to one whom<br>\
you send, and require to be quick; and means<br>\
pause not for anything, for it is as though I were<br>\
looking at thee. (TA in art. عين.) رَأَى المَكَانُ<br>\
المَكَانَ (tropical:)  The place faced [or (as we say) looked<br>\
upon] the place, as though seeing it, (M, TA,) is<br>\
tropical: (TA:) [and in like manner you say,]<br>\
دَارِى تَرَى دَارَهُ (tropical:)  My house faces [or looks upon]<br>\
his house. (T, IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  رَأَىفِى مَنَامِهِ رُؤْيَا<br>\
[He saw, i. e. fancied that he saw, in his sleep, a<br>\
vision, or dream]. (S, Msb, K. *) ―<br>\
-b4-  أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى<br>\
كَذَا [Has thou not considered such a thing, so<br>\
as to be admonished thereby?] is a phrase used<br>\
on an occasion of wonder (IAth, K, TA) at a<br>\
thing, and in rousing the attention of the person<br>\
to whom it is addressed; as in the saying in the<br>\
Kur [ii. 244], أَلَمْ تَرَ إِلَى الَّذِينَ خَرَجُوا مِنْ دِيَارِهِمْ<br>\
[Hast thou not considered those who went forth<br>\
from their houses, so as to be admonished by<br>\
their case?]; meaning, hast thou not wondered<br>\
at their act, and has not their case come to thy<br>\
knowledge? and so in other instances in the<br>\
same: (IAth, TA:) Er-Rághib says that, when<br>\
رَأَيْت is made trans. by means of إِلَى, it denotes<br>\
consideration that leads to the becoming admonished. (TA.) In like manner also, (IAth, K,)<br>\
أَرَأَيْتَكَ and أَرَأَيْتَكُمَا and أَرَأَيْتَكُمْ, (T, IAth, K,) and<br>\
to a woman أَرَأَيْتَكِ, and to a pl. number of women<br>\
أَرَأَيْتَكُنَّ, (T,) [which may be lit. rendered Hast<br>\
thou, and have ye two, &amp;c., considered?] are expressions used to arouse attention, (IAth, TA,)<br>\
meaning tell thou me and tell ye two me &amp;c.;<br>\
(T, IAth, K;) as in the saying in the Kur<br>\
[xvii. 64], قَالَ أَرَأَيْتَكَ هٰذَا الَّذِى كَرَّمْتُ عَلَىَّ [He<br>\
said, Hast thou considered? meaning tell me,<br>\
respecting this whom Thou hast honoured above<br>\
me]; and in the same [vi. 40 and 47], قَلْ أَرَأَيْتَكُمْ<br>\
إِنْ أَتَاكُمْ عَذَابُ اللّٰهِ [Say thou, Have ye considered? meaning tell me, if the punishment of<br>\
God come upon you]; and occurring without the<br>\
ك in other places thereof: (IAth, TA:) you say<br>\
also, أَرَأَيْتَ زَيْدًا and أَرَأَيْتَكَ زَيْدًا, meaning Tell<br>\
thou me [respecting Zeyd]: (Mgh:) and for<br>\
أَرَأَيْتَ and أَرَأَيْتَكَ [&amp;c.] some say أَرَيْتَ and أَرَيْتَكَ:<br>\
(S:) the pronunciation without ء is the more<br>\
common: the ت in أَرَأَيْتَكَ &amp;c. is always with<br>\
fet-h; and accord. to the grammarians of accredited science, the ك in these cases is redundant;<br>\
(T;) [i. e.] it is a particle of allocution, to corroborate the pronoun [ت, which it therefore immediately follows in every case, distinguishing the<br>\
genders and numbers by its own variations, which<br>\
are the same as those of the pronominal affix of<br>\
the second person]: (Bd in vi. 40:) [IHsh says,]<br>\
the correct opinion is that of Sb; that the ت is<br>\
an agent, and the ك is a particle of allocution:<br>\
(Mughnee in art. ك:) but sometimes أَرَأَيْتَكَ &amp;c.<br>\
mean هَلْ رَأَيْتَ نَفْسَكَ &amp;c.; the ك being in this<br>\
case an objective complement [and the verb being<br>\
differently rendered according as it has not, or<br>\
has, a second objective complement, as is shown<br>\
here by what precedes and what follows]. (T.)<br>\
In أَتُرَاكَ, also, [from ↓ أُرِىَ, not from رُئِىَ,] meaning اتظنّ [i. e. أَتَظُنُّ, Thinkest thou?], the pronoun [as some term it, but properly the final<br>\
particle,] is [a particle of allocution] like that in<br>\
أَرَأَيْتَكَ in the Kur vi. 40 and 47 [cited above;<br>\
and in the same sense as this latter phrase, أَتُرَاكَ<br>\
is used, as meaning tell thou me]. (Har p. 570.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  When رَأَى means He knew, (S, Msb,) or he<br>\
thought, (Msb,) it has two objective complements:<br>\
(S, Msb:) or when it has two objective complements, it necessarily means knowing [or the like].<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA.) [In this case, رَآهُ may be rendered He saw, or knew, him, or it, to be: and<br>\
he thought, or judged, or held, him, or it, to be;<br>\
or he regarded, or held, him, or it, as.] You<br>\
say, رَأَيْتُ زَيْدًا عَالِمًا, (S, Msb, *) or حَلِيمًا, (M,)<br>\
I knew [or saw Zeyd to be learned, or forbearing]; (S, M, Msb;) as though seeing him to<br>\
be so with the eye: (M:) and I thought him<br>\
[&amp;c.] to be so. (Msb.) In like manner, also,<br>\
↓ تَرَآءَيْتُهُ signifies I thought him to be. (Har<br>\
p. 211.) يَرَوْنَهُمْ مِثْلَيْهِمْ رَأْىَ العَيْنِ, in the Kur<br>\
[iii. 11], means They [who were the unbelievers]<br>\
thinking them [who were fighting in the cause of<br>\
God] twice as many as they, according to the<br>\
evidence of the sight of the eye. (TA.) The pass.<br>\
form of رَأَى has [only] one objective complement:<br>\
you say, رُئِىَ زَيْدٌ عَاقِلًا, meaning Zeyd was thought<br>\
[to be intelligent]: (TA:) and اَلَّذِى أُرَاهُ, with<br>\
the verb in the pass. form, means الذىاظنّ [i. e.<br>\
أُظَنُّ, He whom I am thought to be; if from<br>\
رُئِىَ: or الذىأَظُنُّ, what I think, if from ↓ أُرِىَ:<br>\
it is often used in the latter sense]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
You say also, رَأَى فِى الأَمْرِ رَأْيًا [He formed, or<br>\
held, an opinion, or a persuasion, or a belief,<br>\
respecting the affair, or case]: (Msb:) and so<br>\
فِىالفِقْهِ [in the science of the law]. (S.) And<br>\
الَّذِى أَرَاهُ That to which I take, or which I hold, as<br>\
my opinion, or persuasion, or belief. (Msb.) And<br>\
فُلَانٌ يَرَى رَأْىَ الشُّرَاةِ Such a one holds, or believes,<br>\
the tenets, or belief, of the شراة [a certain sect of<br>\
schismatics; pl. of شَارٍ]. (M.) When رَأَى is<br>\
[thus] used as meaning He held, or believed, it<br>\
has [only] one objective complement. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
لَا تَرَ مَا (T, K, TA, [mentioned also in the K in<br>\
art. ترم, in which art. in the CK CK it is written<br>\
لا تَرْما,]) and لَا تَرَى مَا, and لَوْ تَرَ مَا, and لَوْ تَرَىمَا,<br>\
(T, TA, [in copies of the K أَوْتَرَ مَا, which I<br>\
think a mistranscription, and for which is put in<br>\
the TA, as on the authority of IAar, اذ تر ما,<br>\
app. a mistranscription of a mistranscription, i. e.<br>\
of اوترما,]) and لَمْ تَرَ مَا, (T, K, TA,) in this<br>\
last case with تَرَ [only, agreeably with a general<br>\
rule], are forms of expression meaning لَا سِيَّمَا<br>\
[i. e., virtually, Above all, or especially]: (T, K,<br>\
TA:) you say, إِنَّهُ لَخَبِيثٌ وَلَا تَرَ مَا فُلَانٌ and<br>\
وَ لَا تَرَى مَا فُلَانٌ and وَ لَوْ تَرَ مَا فُلَانٌ and وَلَوْ تَرَى<br>\
مَا فُلَانٌ and .َلَمْ تَرَ مَا فُلَانٌ [i. e. Verily he is bad,<br>\
or base, or wicked; and above all, or especially,<br>\
such a one: وَلَا تَرَ مَا فُلَانٌ, or وَلَا تَرَىمَا فُلَانٌ,<br>\
properly meaning وَلَا تَرَىمِثْلَ الَّذِى هُوَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
and thou will not see the like of him who is such<br>\
a one; مِثْلَ and هُوَ being understood: and in like<br>\
manner are to be explained the other forms of<br>\
expression here mentioned]: in all of these forms,<br>\
فلان is in the nom. case: all are mentioned by<br>\
Lh, on the authority of Ks. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  رَأَتْ is<br>\
also said of a woman, as meaning She saw what<br>\
is termed التَّرْئِيَة and التَّرِيَّة, i. e., a little yellowness<br>\
or whiteness  or blood on the occasion of menstruation. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  رَأَيْتُهُ [form الرِّئَةُ] I hit, or hurt,<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K, *) or struck, or smote, (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA,) his رِئَة [or lungs]: (S, M, Msb, K, Er-Rághib:) and so وَرَيْتُهُ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And رُئِىَ<br>\
He had a complaint of his رِئَة [or lungs]; (M;)<br>\
as also ↓ أَرْأَى. (T, K.)<br>\
-A3-  رَأَيْتُ رَايَةً I stuck, or<br>\
fixed, a banner, or standard, (T in art. رى, and<br>\
K in the present art.,) into the ground; (TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ أَرَأَيْتُهَا, (T, K,) as some say: (T:) the<br>\
latter is mentioned by Lh; but [ISd says,] I<br>\
hold that it is anomalous, and is properly only<br>\
أَرَيَيْتُهَا. (M in art. رى, and TA.)<br>\
-A4-  رَأَىالزَّنْدُ<br>\
[like وَرَى and وَرِىَ] The زند [or piece of wood<br>\
for producing fire] became kindled. (Kr, M, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And رَأَيْتُ الزَّنْدَ I kindled the زند. (M, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
رَأَّيْتُهُ, inf. n. تَرْئِيَةٌ, I held for him, or to him,<br>\
(AZ, T, S,) or I showed, or presented, to him,<br>\
(M, K,) or I withheld, or retained, or restricted,<br>\
for him, [i. e. for his use,] (AZ, * T, * S, * M, K,)<br>\
the mirror, in order that he might look in it,<br>\
(AZ, T, S, K,) or in order that he might see himself in it; (M;) as also المِرْآةَ ↓ أَرَيْتُهُ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also 3.<br>\
3<br>\
رَآءَيْتُهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. مُرَاآةٌ and رِئَآءٌ, (M,)<br>\
I faced, so that I saw, him, or it; (M, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ تَرَآءَيْتُهُ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, inf. ns. as above,<br>\
[I acted hypocritically, or with simulation,<br>\
towards him;] I pretended to him that I was<br>\
otherwise than I really was; (M, K; *) as also<br>\
↓ رَأَّيْتُهُ, inf. n. تَرْئِيَةٌ: (K:) both are mentioned by<br>\
Fr: (T:) [accord. to J,] رَآءَى فُلَانٌ النَّاسَ, aor.<br>\
يُرَائِيهِمْ, inf. n. مُرَاآةٌ, and رَايَاهُمْ, inf. n. مُرَايَاةٌ, the<br>\
latter formed by transposition, [which indicates,<br>\
though written as above in my copies of the S,<br>\
that we should read رَايَأَهُمْ, inf. n. مُرَايَأَةٌ,] signify<br>\
the same: (S:) [but it is said in the Mgh that<br>\
رَايَا (perhaps thus written for رَايَأَ) in the sense of<br>\
رَآءَى is a mistake: and] رَآءَى signifies [he acted<br>\
ostentatiously; i. e.] he did a deed in order that<br>\
men might see it: (Mgh:) or رِئَآءٌ signifies the<br>\
making a show of what one does to men, in order<br>\
that they may see it and think well of it: and<br>\
the acting otherwise than for the sake of God:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) and it is said in the S to be a subst.<br>\
[as distinguished from an inf. n.; but why so, I<br>\
do not see]. (TA.) Hence, in the Kur [cvii. 6],<br>\
اَلَّذِينَ هُمْ يُرَاؤُونَ Who act hypocritically; when<br>\
the believers pray, praying with them, pretending<br>\
to them that they follow the same way [of religion] as they: (M, TA:) or who make a show of<br>\
their works to men, in order to be praised by<br>\
them. (Bd.) And مَنْ رَآءَى رَآءَى اللّٰهُ بِهِ He who<br>\
does a deed in order that men may see it, God<br>\
will expose his doing so on the day of resurrection.<br>\
(Mgh) And فَعَلَ ذٰلِكَ رِئَآءً وَسُمْعَةً [He did that<br>\
in order to make others to see it and hear of it].<br>\
(S.) [See also 4.] ―<br>\
-b3-  In the saying of El-Farezdak,<br>\
satirizing a people, and charging one of their<br>\
women with that which is not comely,<br>\
وَ بَاتَ يُرَاآهَا حَصَانًا وَ قَدْ جَرَتْ<br>\
لَنَا بُرَتَاهَا بِالَّذِى أَنَ شَاكِرُهْ<br>\
[And he passed the night thinking her chaste,<br>\
when her two anklets had run to us with that for<br>\
which I was thankful], by يُرَاآهَا [with حَصَانًا<br>\
following it] he means يَظُنُّ أَنَّهَا حَصَانٌ, i. e.<br>\
عَفِيفَةٌ; and by جَرَتْ لَنَا بُرَتَاهَا he means أَنَّهَا أَمْكَنَتْهُ<br>\
مِنْ رِجْلَيْهَا حَتَّى غَشِيَهَا. (T.) ―<br>\
-b4-  رَآءَيْتُهُ also signifies I consulted with him; or asked his counsel,<br>\
or advice: (T, K: *) and فِى الرَّأْىِ ↓ اِسْتَرْأَيْتُهُ I<br>\
consulted him, or asked his counsel, or advice,<br>\
respecting the opinion. (T, K.) &#39;Imrán Ibn-<br>\
Hittán says,<br>\
فَإِنْ نَكُنْ نَحْنُ شَاوَرْنَاكَ قُلْتَ لَنَا<br>\
بِالنُّصْحِ مِنْكَ لَنَا فِيمَا نُرَائِيكَا<br>\
i. e. [And if we ask thy counsel, or advice, thou<br>\
pronouncest to us, with honesty on thy part<br>\
towards us, concerning that] respecting which we<br>\
ask thy counsel, or advice. (T.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَرَيْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ, (IAar, T, S, M, K,) originally<br>\
أَرَأَيْتُهُ, (S,) inf. n. إِرَآءَةٌ (Sb, IAar, T, M, K) and<br>\
إِرَايَةٌ (IAar, T) and إِرَآءٌ, (Sb, IAar, T, M, K,) [the<br>\
last originally إِرْأَاءٌ,] the ة in the first inf. n. being<br>\
a substitute [for the suppressed أ, and in like<br>\
manner in the second], and the last inf. n. being<br>\
without any substitution, (Sb, M,) [I made him<br>\
to see the thing; i. e. I showed him the thing:]<br>\
you say, أَرَيْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ فَرَآهُ [I showed him the thing,<br>\
and he saw it[. (S.) See also 8. Aboo-&#39;Amr<br>\
read أَرْنَا مَنَاسِكَنَا, [in the Kur ii. 122, for أَرِنَا i. e.<br>\
Show Thou to us our religious rites and caremonies of the pilgrimage, or our places where<br>\
those rites and ceremonies are to be performed,]<br>\
which is anomalous. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also,<br>\
أَرَى اللّٰهُ بِفُلَانٍ, meaning God showed men by<br>\
[the example of] such a one punishment and<br>\
destruction: (K:) or God showed by [the example of] such a one that which would cause his<br>\
enemy to rejoice at his misfortune: a saying of<br>\
the Arabs: (T in art. رى:) said only in relation<br>\
to evil. (Sh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And أَرِنِى الشَّىْءَ Give thou,<br>\
or hand thou, to me the thing. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  أَرَى<br>\
in the sense of أَعْلَمَ [as meaning He made such a<br>\
one to know a thing, or person, to be, as in the<br>\
saying, أَرَيْتُ زَيْدًا عَمْرًامُنْطَلِقًا I made Zeyd to<br>\
know “ Amr to be going away, which may be<br>\
rendered I showed Zeyd that &#39;Amr was going<br>\
away,] requires [as this ex. shows] three objective<br>\
complements. (M, and Bd in iv. 106. [See I “ AK,<br>\
p. 117.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  This is not the case in the saying in<br>\
the Kur [iv. 106], لِتَحْكُمَ بَيْنَ النَّاسَ بِمَا أَرَاكَ اللّٰهُ;<br>\
(M, Bd;) for here it has but two objective complements, namely, the ك in اراك, and the suppressed pronoun هُ in أَرَاكَهُ: it is in this instance<br>\
from الرَّأْىُ in the sense of الإِعْتِقَادُ: (M:) the<br>\
meaning is, [That thou mayest judge between<br>\
men] by means of that which God hath taught<br>\
thee, syn. عَرَّفَكَ, (Ksh, Bd,) or عَلَّمَكَ, (Jel,) and<br>\
revealed to thee. (Ksh, Bd.) ―<br>\

an intrans. v., preserving the original form, inf. n.<br>\
إِرْآءٌ, as below,] He looked in the mirror; (T, K;)<br>\
and so فِى المِرْآةِ ↓ تَرَأَّى and فِيهَا ↓ تَرَآءَى: (T, M,<br>\
K:) or ↓ تَرَآءَى signifies he (a man) looked at his<br>\
face in the mirror or in the sword: (S:) and<br>\
فِى المَآءِ ↓ تَمَرْأَى he looked at his face in the<br>\
water; the doing of which is forbidden in a trad;<br>\
of the measure تَمَفْعَلَ [from المِرْآةُ]; mentioned<br>\
by Sb; like تَمَسْكَنَ from المِسْكِينُ, and تَمَدْرَعَ<br>\
from المِدْرَعَةُ, and تَمَنْدَلَ from المِنْدِيلُ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
He (a man) had many dreams. (T, K. *) ―<br>\

He moved his eyelids, (K,) or made much motion<br>\
with his eyes, (T,) in looking: (T, K:) you say,<br>\

TA. *) ―<br>\
-b4-  He acted (T, K) well, or righteously,<br>\
(T,) in order to make others see what he did,<br>\
and hear of it. (T, K.) [See also 3.] ―<br>\
-b5-  He<br>\
possessed, or became possessed of, intelligence<br>\
(K, TA) and judgment and forecast: (TA:)<br>\
inf. n. إِرْآءٌ. (K, TA. [The inf. n. is mentioned<br>\
with this signification, in the K, app. because it<br>\
is the first there explained, and therefore as applying to the verb in all its senses.]) ―<br>\
-b6-  And He<br>\
had the appearance, or evidence, of foolishness,<br>\
or stupidity, in his face: (T, K, TA: [the words<br>\
by which Az explains this meaning are تَبَيَّنَتْ<br>\
آراؤهُ فى وَجْهِهِ وهى الحماقةُ, accord. to one copy<br>\
of the T; in another copy of the same, الرؤاه:<br>\
the TA follows the former reading: but the right<br>\
reading is الرَّأْوَةٌ; mentioned in the T, thus correctly written, in art. رأرأ; in the S, in the present<br>\
art; and in the M, in art. رأو, which is its proper<br>\
art., and therefore the proper art. of the verb in<br>\
the sense thus explained:]) thus it bears two<br>\
contr. meanings. (K. [But it is added in the<br>\
TA that this requires consideration.]) ―<br>\
-b7-  Also<br>\
He had what is termed a رَئِىّ, of the jinn, or<br>\
genii; (T, K, TA;) i. e., a follower, of the jinn.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And He followed the opinion, or belief,<br>\
of some one, or more, of the lawyers (K, TA) in<br>\
the science of the law. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  أَرْأَتْ said of a<br>\
she-camel and of a ewe or she-goat, (M,) and of<br>\
any female in a state of pregnancy, except a solidhoofed animal and a beast of prey, Her udder<br>\
showed her to be pregnant: (M, K:) and in like<br>\
manner it is said of a woman: (M:) or, said of<br>\
a ewe or she-goat, she was, or became, big in her<br>\
udder: (S:) and accord. to IAar, said of a she-goat, she was, or became, swollen in her vulva,<br>\
and her being so became apparent, or evident.<br>\
(M.) And أَرْأَى said of a man, His ewe, or she-goat, was, or became, black in her udder. (T.)<br>\
-A3-  See also 1, in two places, near the end of the<br>\
paragraph.<br>\

that أَرأَى, said of a camel, means اِنْتَكَثَ خَطْمُهُ<br>\
عَلَى حَلْقِهِ; in the CK انْتَكَبَ; and in the TA<br>\
this is said to be on the authority of En-Nadr:<br>\
but in a copy of the T, I find it stated, on the<br>\
authority of ISh, (i. e. En-Nadr,) that الارآ (i. e.<br>\
الإِرْآءُ) signifies انتكاثُ خطم البَعيرِ على حَلْقِه: in<br>\
another copy of the T, on the authority of En-Nadr, that الرآ (a mistranscription for الإِرْآءُ) signifies انتكاث خطم البعير خِلقة: and it is added that<br>\
the epithet applied to a camel is مُرأى (as in one<br>\
copy, i. e. ↓ مُرْأَى, and thus it is written in the<br>\
TA, but in the other copy of the T مراْى, an<br>\
obvious mistranscription); and to camels, مُرآاتٌ<br>\
(as in one copy, for مُرْأَاتٌ, i. e. مُرْآتٌ, in the other<br>\
copy of the T erroneously written مُرَأاة, and in<br>\
the TA مرايات): therefore the verb is evidently<br>\
أُرْئِىَ, in the pass. form, inf. n. إِرْآءٌ; and I think<br>\
that the correct explanation is اِنْتَكَثَ خَطْمُهُ خِلْقَةً,<br>\
app. meaning His muzzle was thin, or lean, by<br>\
nature: see art. نكث: and see also مُرْأًى below.]<br>\

as it is written in some copies of the K,] (T, K,)<br>\
[i. e. (tropical:)  Their two fires shall not be within sight of<br>\
each-other;] meaning that the Muslim may not<br>\
dwell in the country of the believers in a plurality<br>\
of gods, and be with them so that each of them<br>\
shall see the fire of the other: (T, K *) so says<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd: or, accord. to AHeyth, it means that<br>\
the Muslim may not mark himself with the mark<br>\
of the believer in a plurality of gods, nor assimilate himself to him in conduct and guise, nor<br>\
assume his manners, or dispositions; from the<br>\
phrase مَا نَارُ بَعِيرِكَ, meaning “ What is the brand<br>\
of thy camel? ” (T:) IAth explains it similarly to<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd; and says that the verb is thus used<br>\
tropically. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ترآءى لِى He addressed, or<br>\

رَأْىٌ is an inf. n. of رَأَى [q. v.]: (T, S, K:) [and<br>\

looked into, examined, or considered, (مَا ارْتَآهُ,)<br>\

&amp;c.!]. (Lth, T.) أَصْحَابُ الرَّأْىِ, [often meaning<br>\
The speculatists, or theorists,] as used by those<br>\
who treat of the traditions, means the followers<br>\
of analogy; because they pronounce according to<br>\

who reads it [thus] with ء; and read without ء it<br>\
may be from the same, or from رَوِيَتْ أَلْوَانُهُمْ<br>\
وَجُلُودُهُمْ meaning “ their colours and skins became full and beautiful ” [or rather “ beautiful<br>\
and full ”] : (S:) for Náfi&#39; and Ibn-&#39;Ámir read<br>\

One says ↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ حَسَنَةُ المَرْآةِ and ↓ المَرْأَى [A<br>\
