رَجِزَ, [aor.<br>\
رَجَزَ,] (S,) inf. n. رَجَزٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
(a camel) had the disease termed رَجَزٌ [expl. below].<br>\
(S.)<br>\
-A2-  رَجَزَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
رَجُزَ, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. رَجْزٌ, (TA,) He said, spoke, uttered, or<br>\
recited, poetry, or verse, of the metre termed رَجَزٌ;<br>\
[see this word below;] he spoke in verse of that<br>\
metre; he poetized, or versified, in that metre;<br>\
as also ↓ ارتجز; (S, * Msb, K, * TA;) and in like<br>\
manner ↓ ارجز, he composed verses of that metre.<br>\
(Ibn-Buzurj, L in art. قصد.) You say also,<br>\
رَجَزَبِهِ He recited to him (أَنْشَدَهُ [so in more than<br>\
one MS. copy of the K, and in the TA, but in the<br>\
CK أَنْشَدَ, without the affixed pronoun, which is<br>\
probably wrong,]) a poem of that metre; as also<br>\
↓ رجّزهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. تَرْجِيزٌ. (TA.) And ↓ ترجّز<br>\
He urged, or excited, his camels by singing رَجَز,<br>\
or his رَجَز: so accord. to different copies of the<br>\
K. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] رَجَزَتِ الرِّيحُ, inf. n. رَجْزٌ,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The wind was continuous, or lasting. (TA.)<br>\
And الرَّعْدُ ↓ ارتجز (tropical:)  The thunder made uninterrupted sounds, like the recitation of the رَاجِز:<br>\
(A, TA:) or, as also ↓ ترجّز, made a sound:<br>\
(K:) or made consecutive sounds. (TA.) And<br>\
بَآذِيِّهِ ↓ البَحْرُ يَرْتَجِزُ (tropical:)  [The sea makes a continuous<br>\
sound, or murmuring, with its waves]; as also<br>\
↓ يَتَرَجَّزُ. (A, TA.) [And hence, perhaps,] ↓ ترجّز<br>\
السَّحَابُ (tropical:)  The clouds moved slowly by reason of<br>\
the abundance of their water. (K, TA.) [See<br>\
also 6.]<br>\
2<br>\
رجّزهُ: see 1.<br>\
3<br>\
راجز صَاحِبَهُ [He recited verses, or poetry, of<br>\
the metre termed رَجَز with his companion: or vied<br>\
with him in doing so: see 6]. (A.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَرْجَزَ see 1.<br>\
5<br>\
تَرَجَّزَ see 1, in four places.<br>\
6<br>\
تراجزوا i. q. تَنَازَعُوا الرَّجَزَ بَيْنَهُمْ, (A, K,) and<br>\
تَعَاطَوْهُ, (TA,) i. e. They recited verses, or poetry,<br>\
of the metre termed رَجَز, one with another: (TK:)<br>\
[or vied, one with another, in doing so.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] تراجز السَّحَابُ (tropical:)  [The clouds combined,<br>\
one with another, in uninterrupted thundering].<br>\
(A.) [See also 1.]<br>\
8<br>\
إِرْتَجَزَ see 1, in three places.<br>\
رُجْزٌ: see the next paragraph, in four places.<br>\
رِجْزٌ properly signifies Commotion, agitation, or<br>\
convulsion; and consecutiveness of motions. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) Punishment (Aboo-Is-hák, S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K) [like رِجْسٌ] that agitates by its<br>\
vehemence, and occasions vehement consecutive<br>\
commotions; (Aboo-Is-hák, Mgh, * TA;) as also<br>\
↓ رُجْزٌ: (K:) so in the Kur vii. 131; (Aboo-Is-hák;) and in ii. 56, and vii. 162, and xxix. 33.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Conduct that leads to punishment: so,<br>\
accord. to some, in the Kur lxxiv. 5; (TA;)<br>\
where some read الرِّجْزَ and others ↓ الرُّجْزَ: (S,<br>\
TA:) ↓ the latter is also expl. as signifying sin:<br>\
(TA:) and both, uncleanness; or filth: (S, K:)<br>\
so in that instance: like رِجْسٌ: (S:) and polytheism; or the associating of another, or others,<br>\
with the true God: (K, TA:) so, accord to some,<br>\
in that instance: because he who worships what<br>\
is not God is in doubt respecting his case, and<br>\
unsettled in his belief: (TA:) and the worship<br>\
of idols: (K:) so, accord. to some, in the same<br>\
instance: (TA:) or the meaning there is and idol:<br>\
(Mujáhid, S:) or ↓ the latter word signifies a<br>\
certain idol; being the name thereof: (Katádeh,<br>\
TA:) and the devil: and his suggestions. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Also Plague, or pestilence; syn. طَاعُونٌ.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
رَجَزٌ A certain disease which attacks camels, in<br>\
the rump; (S, K;) so that when a she-camel<br>\
rises, or is roused, her thighs tremble for a while,<br>\
and then stretch out: (S:) or it is when there is<br>\
a convulsive motion in the hind leg or the thighs<br>\
of a camel, when he desires to stand up, or rises,<br>\
or is roused, for a while, and then a stretching<br>\
out of the same. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Hence, (S,) الرَّجَزُ is<br>\
the name of A certain species [or kind] of verse<br>\
or poetry; (S, A, K;) a species [or kind] of the<br>\
metres of verse; (Msb;) consisting of the measure<br>\
مُسْتَفْعِلُنْ [primarily] six times: (K:) a metre<br>\
easy to the ear and impressive to the mind;<br>\
wherefore it may be reduced to a single hemistich, and also to two feet instead of six: (TA:)<br>\
so called because it commences with a motion<br>\
and a quiescence, [i. e., a movent and a quiescent<br>\
letter,] followed by a motion and a quiescence;<br>\
and so in the other feet; resembling the رَجَز in a<br>\
she-camel, which consists in her quivering and<br>\
then being quiet: (TA:) or because of the contractedness of its feet, and the fewness of its<br>\
letters: (S, K:) or because it is [characterized<br>\
by] صُدُور without أَعْجَاز [lit. breasts without<br>\
rumps; for, as the two hemistichs generally rhyme<br>\
with each other, the verse seems as though it had<br>\
no عَجُز; i. e., as though its last foot should rather<br>\
be called عَرُوضٌ, like the last of the first hemistich, than عَجُزٌ:] (TA:) Akh once said, رَجَزٌ,<br>\
with the Arabs, is whatever consists of three feet;<br>\
and it is that [kind of verse] which they sing in<br>\
their work, and in driving their camels: [see<br>\
بِذْلَةٌ, last sentence:] ISd says that certain of<br>\
those in whom he placed confidence related this<br>\
on the authority of Kh. (TA.) Some say that it<br>\
is not verse, or poetry, but a kind of rhyming<br>\
prose; but Kh held it to be true verse, or poetry:<br>\
so in the M: but in the T it is said [as in the K]<br>\
that Kh asserted it to be not poetry, but halves<br>\
or thirds of verses: one of his reasons for this<br>\
assertion [the only one that seems to have had<br>\
much weight with the Muslims] is, that Mo-<br>\
hammad once said,<br>\
أَنَا ابْنُ عَبْدِ المُطَّلِبْ  أَنَا النَّبِىُّ لَا كَذِبْ<br>\
[which is an instance of a species of رَجَز, meaning, “I am the Prophet: it is no lie: I am the<br>\
son of &#39;Abd-el-Muttalib ”]: and were this verse,<br>\
he would not have said it, as is shown by what is<br>\
said in the Kur., xxxvi. 69: but on this point,<br>\
Akh has contended against him. (TA.)<br>\
رِجَازَةٌ A certain vehicle for women, (S, * TA,)<br>\
a thing smaller than the هَوْدَج: (S, K, TA:) pl.<br>\
رَجَائِزُ: (TA:) or a [garment of the kind called]<br>\
كِسَآء, (S, K, TA,) in which is a stone, (K, TA,<br>\
[in the CK a while stone,]) or in which are put<br>\
stones, (S,) and which is suspended to one of the<br>\
two sides of the هودج, to balance it, when it<br>\
inclines: (S, TA:) so called because of its commotion: (TA:) or a thing consisting of a<br>\
pillow and skins, or hides, put in one of its two<br>\
sides for that purpose, and called رِجَازَةُ المَيْلِ:<br>\
(T, TA:) or hair, (K,) or red hair, (TA,) or<br>\
wool, suspended to the هورج, (K, TA,) for ornament: pl. رَجَائِزُ, said to occur in a verse of EshShemmákh: but accord. to As, this is a mistake<br>\
for جَزَائِزُ [pl. of جَزِيزَةٌ, q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
رَجَّازٌ and رَجَّازَةٌ: see رَاجِزٌ; the latter, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
رَاجِزٌ One who utters, or recites, poetry, or verse,<br>\
of the metre termed رَجَزٌ; who speaks in verse of<br>\
that metre; who poetizes, or versifies, in that<br>\
metre: and in like manner, ↓ مُرْتَجِزٌ, and ↓ رَجَّازٌ<br>\
[which signifies one who does so much], and<br>\
↓ رَجَّازَةٌ [one who does so very much]. (TA.)<br>\
El-&#39;Ajjáj has been placed the highest in rank as<br>\
a راجز. (Mz, 49th نوع.) [His son, Ru-beh, seems<br>\
to occupy nearly an equal place. Each of them<br>\
composed a complete deewán of رَجَز.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
↓ سَحَابَةٌ رَجَّازَةٌ (tropical:)  [A cloud thundering much, or<br>\
uninterruptedly]. (A, TA.) And ↓ غَيْثٌ مُرْتَجِزٌ,<br>\
and ↓ مُتَرَجِّزٌ, (tropical:)  Rain accompanied by thunder.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
أَرْجَزُ A camel having the disease termed رَجَزٌ:<br>\
fem. رَجْزَآءُ: (S, K:) the latter is explained as<br>\
signifying weak in the rump, that does not move<br>\
from her place unless after twice or thrice rising<br>\
from the place where she lay: and that does not<br>\
rise, when she desires to do so, unless after vehement trembling. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] إِنَّهَا لَرَجْزَآءُ,<br>\
said of the wind (الرِّيح), (assumed tropical:)  Verily it is continuous,<br>\
or lasting. (TA.) And رَجْزَآءُ القِيَامِ (tropical:)  A great,<br>\
heavy cooking-pot. (TA.)<br>\
أُرْجُوزَةٌ A poem of the metre termed رَجَزٌ: (Msb,<br>\
K:) pl. أَرَاجِيزُ. (A, K.)<br>\
مُرْتَجِزٌ: see رَاجِزٌ; the former, in two places.<br>\
مُتَرَجِّزٌ: see رَاجِزٌ; the former, in two places.<br>\
