inf. n. رَوْقٌ, (S,) It (wine, or beverage, S, or<br>\

-A2-  راق عَلَيْهِ, (JK,<br>\
K,) aor. as above, (JK,) and so the inf. n., (K,)<br>\
He, or it, exceeded him, or it: (JK:) [and] he,<br>\
or it, exceeded him, or it, in excellence. (K.)<br>\
You say, راق فِى يَدِى كَذَا Such a thing was<br>\

hand; like رَاعَ; syn. زَادَ. (L in art. ريع.) And<br>\
راق فُلَانٌ عَلَى أَهْلِهِ Such a one was, or became,<br>\
above, or superior to, his family; surpassed, or<br>\

-A3-  رَاقَنِى, (JK, S,<br>\

[perhaps a mistranscription, for only the former<br>\

the upper of which projected over the lower: or<br>\

2<br>\

He cleared, or clarified, (S, Msb, K,) wine, or<br>\

the selling one&#39;s garment, and adding something<br>\
to it, and buying [with that garment and the<br>\
thing added to it] another garment better than<br>\
it: (JK:) [or the buying, with a thing and something added thereto, a better thing: for] one<br>\
says, بَاعَ سِلْعَتَهُ فَرَوَّقَ [He sold his commodity,<br>\
and bought with it and something added thereto<br>\

such a one for his commodity, not desiring it<br>\

former by رَفَعَ لَهُ فِى سَوْمِهَا وَ لَا يُرِيدُهَا; and in the<br>\
latter by رَفَعَ لَهُ فِى ثَمَنِهَا وَ هُوَ لَا يُرِيدُهَا.)<br>\

-A2-  اراقهُ, (Msb in art. ريق, and<br>\
K in that and the present art.,) inf. n. إِرَاقَةٌ, (S in<br>\
the present art., and so in the K accord. to the<br>\
TA,) He poured it out, or forth; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
namely, water and the like, (S,) or water and<br>\
blood: (Msb:) and one says also هَرَاقَهُ, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) changing the أ into ه, originally هَرْيَقَهُ, like<br>\
دَحْرَجَهُ, in measure, (Msb,) said by Lh to be of<br>\
the dial. of El-Yemen, and afterwards to have<br>\
spread among Mudar, (TA in art. ريق,) aor.<br>\
يُهَرِيقُهُ, (Msb, TA,) with fet-h to the ه, imperative<br>\
هَرِقْ, originally هَرْيِقْ, like دَحْرِجْ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
هِرَاقَةٌ; (S and K in art. هرق;) and أَهْرَاقَهُ, aor.<br>\
يُهْرِيقُهُ, (Msb, TA,) with the ه quiescent, like<br>\
يُسْطِيعُ aor. of إِسْطَاعَ; or, accord. to the T, أَهْرَقْتُ<br>\
is wrong as being anomalous; and some say,<br>\
هَرَقْتُهُ, aor.<br>\
رَوَقَ, inf. n. هَرْقٌ, as though the ه were<br>\
radical. (Msb.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّ امْرَأَةً<br>\
كَانَتْ تُهَرَاقُ الدِّمَآءَ or تُهْرَاقُ, the verb being in<br>\
the pass. form, and the ه either meftoohah or<br>\
quiescent, and الدماء being in the accus. case as<br>\
a specificative; [so that the meaning is, Verily a<br>\
woman used to pour forth with blood; for تهراق<br>\
is equivalent to تَرِيقُ; but by rule the specificative<br>\
should be without the article ال;] or الدماء may<br>\
be in the nom. case, الدِّمَآءُ being for دِمَاؤُهَا [i. e.<br>\
her blood used to pour forth]. (Msb.) ISd says<br>\
that أَرَاقَ is judged to be originally أَرْوَقَ because<br>\
the medial radical letter of a verb is more commonly<br>\
و than ى; and because, when water is poured forth,<br>\
its clearness appears, and it excites the admiration<br>\
and approval of its beholder; [to which may be<br>\
added, also because one says, هُما يَتَرَاوَقَانِ المَآءَ;]<br>\
though Ks states that رَاقَ المَآءُ, aor. يَرِيقُ, signifies<br>\
The water poured out, or forth: IB says that<br>\
أَرَقْتُ المَآءَ is from راق المَآءُ, aor. يَرِيقُ, inf. n. رَيْقٌ,<br>\
signifying the water went to and fro upon the<br>\
surface of the earth. (TA.) One says also, of a<br>\
man, اراق مَآءَ ظَهْرِهِ and هَرَاقَهُ and أَهْرَاقَهُ [meaning<br>\
He poured forth his seminal fluid]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
أَرِقْ عَنْكَ مِنَ الظَّهِيرَةِ and هَرِقْ meaning (assumed tropical:)  Stay<br>\
thou until the mid-day heat shall have become<br>\
assuaged, and the air be cool; syn. أَبْرِدْ. (IAar,<br>\

هُمَا يَتَرَاوَقَانِ المَآءَ They two pour the water<br>\
out, or forth, by turns. (TA.)<br>\

-A3-  A horn (JK, S, K, TA) of any<br>\
horned animal: (TA:) pl. أَرْوَاقٌ. (S, TA.)<br>\

that this is] like the saying رَأْسُ جَمَاعَةِ القَوْمِ<br>\
[which means “ the numerous and strong company of the collective body of the people ”].<br>\
(As, O.) ―<br>\

as pointed out below: see the latter word in six<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b6-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The foremost part or portion<br>\
of rain, and of an army, and of a number of<br>\
horses or horsemen. (TA.) And (tropical:)  The first part<br>\
of youth; as also ↓ رَيِّقٌ, (S, O, K,) originally رَيْوِقٌ,<br>\
(O, K,) and ↓ رَيْقٌ, (S, O, K,) which is a contraction of رَيِّقٌ: (O:) you say, فَعَلَهُ فِى رَوْقِ شَبَابِهِ<br>\
and شبابه ↓ رَيِّقِ and شبابه ↓ رَيْقِ (tropical:)  He did it in the<br>\
first part of his youth: (S, TA: *) and مَضَى<br>\

―<br>\
-b9-  (assumed tropical:)  A part, or portion, of the night: (S, K:)<br>\
pl., accord. to IB, أَرْوُقٌ: but accord. to Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee, this is pl. of رِوَاقٌ: (TA:)<br>\
[or the pl. of رَوْقٌ in this sense is أَرْوَاقٌ.] You<br>\
say, مَضَى رَوْقٌ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ (assumed tropical:)  A part, or portion, of<br>\
the night passed. (TA.) And أَرْوَاقُ اللَّيْلِ means<br>\
(tropical:)  The folds (أَثْنَآء) of the darkness of night. (K,<br>\
TA.) And أَرْوَاقُ العَيْنِ (tropical:)  The sides of the eye:<br>\
so in the saying, أَسْبَلَتْ أَرْوَاقُ العَيْنِ (tropical:)  The sides<br>\
of the eye shed tears. (O, K, * TA.) ―<br>\

pl.] أَرْوَاقٌ signifies the (assumed tropical:)  extremities and body, of<br>\
a man: (TA:) and his self; (JK, * TA;) as also<br>\
the singular. (JK, TA.) You say, رَمَوْنَا بِأَرْوَاقِهِمْ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  They threw themselves upon us. (TA.) And<br>\
أَلْقَى عَلَيْنَا أَرْوَاقَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He covered us with himself<br>\

remained at rest in a place; (S, O, K;) like as<br>\
one says, أَلْقَى عَصَاهُ: (S, O:) a meaning said in<br>\
the K to be app. the contr. of what here next<br>\
follows: but this requires consideration. (TA.)<br>\
Also (assumed tropical:)  He ran vehemently: (A &#39;Obeyd, S, O, K:)<br>\
not known, however, to Sh, in this sense; but<br>\
known to him as meaning (assumed tropical:)  he strove, laboured,<br>\
toiled, or exerted himself, in a thing. (TA.)<br>\
[Agreeably with this last explanation, it is said<br>\
that] رَوْقٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A man&#39;s determination,<br>\
or resolution; his action; and his purpose, or<br>\
intention. (K, TA.) And hence the saying,<br>\
أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ أَرْوَاقَهُ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  He devoted his mind<br>\
and energy to it, or him]: (TA:) [or] you say<br>\
thus, and أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ شَرَاشِرَهُ, meaning his loving it,<br>\
or him, (أَنْ يُحِبَّهُ,) vehemently [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  he loved<br>\
it, or him, vehemently; agreeably with explanations of the saying القى عليه شراشره in art. شر,<br>\
q. v.]. (Thus in the JM. [In my two copies of<br>\
the S, and in the O and K, and hence in the TA,<br>\
in the places of عَلَيْهِ and يُحِبَّهُ we find عَلَيْكَ and<br>\
تُحِبَّهُ; evidently mistranscriptions which have<br>\
been copied by one lexicographer after another<br>\
without due consideration: or, if we read عَلَيْكَ,<br>\
we should read يُحِبَّكَ; for in this case the meaning of the saying would certainly be he loved thee<br>\
vehemently. Freytag, misled by the reading تُحِبَّهُ<br>\
in the S and K, renders القى عليك ارواقه as<br>\
meaning Magno amore erga ipsum te accendit.<br>\
Golius gives, in its place, ضرب اوراقه عليه (for<br>\
ارواقه), as meaning Valde amavit eum.]) ―<br>\
-b11-  You<br>\
say also, أَلْقَتِ السَّحَابَةُ أَرْوَاقَهَا, (JK, S, O, K,) or<br>\
القت السحابة عَلَى الأَرْضِ ارواقها, (TA,) (tropical:)  The<br>\
cloud cast down its rain, and its vehement rain<br>\
consisting of large drops, (S, O, K, TA,) upon<br>\
the earth: (TA:) or persevered with rain, and<br>\
remained stationary upon the land: (JK, TA:)<br>\
or أَلْقَتِ السَّمَآءُ بِأَرْوَاقِهَا The sky cast down all the<br>\
water that was in it: (IAmb, O, TA:) or this<br>\
saying, (O, TA,) or the former, (K,) means cast<br>\
down its clear waters; (O, K, TA;) from رَاقَ المَآءُ<br>\
signifying “ the water was, or became, clear: ”<br>\
but IAmb deems this improbable, because the<br>\
Arabs did not say مَآءٌ رَوْقٌ and مَاآنِ رَوْقَانِ and<br>\
أَمْوَاهٌ أَرْوَاقٌ: (O, TA:) [i. e. they said رَوْقٌ only, in<br>\
all cases when they used it as an epithet meaning<br>\
“ clear,” because it is originally an inf. n., like<br>\
عَدْلٌ &amp;c.:] or, as some say, by بارواقها is meant<br>\
its waters rendered heavy by the clouds: and one<br>\
says, أَرْخَتِ السَّمَآءُ أَرْوَاقَهَا and عَزَالِيهَا (assumed tropical:)  [The sky<br>\
loosed, or let down, its spouts; the clouds being<br>\
likened to leathern water-bags]: (TA:) [for]<br>\
رَوْقُ السَّحَابِ means (assumed tropical:)  The مَسِيل [or channel by<br>\
which flows the water] of the clouds. (TA in<br>\
another part of the art. [See also رِوَاقٌ, as used<br>\
in relation to clouds.])<br>\
-A4-  رَوْقٌ also signifies A<br>\
substitute for a thing, (O, K,) accord. to [the<br>\
JK and] Ibn-&#39;Abbád. (O.)<br>\
-A5-  And الرَّوْقُ means<br>\
The breathing of [i. e. in] the agony of death<br>\
(نَفْسُ النَّزْعِ). (O, K, TA. [In the CK and in<br>\
my MS. copy of the K, نَفْسُ النَّزْعِ, which means<br>\
the agony of death itself.])<br>\
رُوقٌ is said to be pl. of رُوقَةٌ, and of رَائِقٌ, and<br>\
of أَرْوَقُ. (TA.) [See these three words.]<br>\
رَوَقٌ Length of the teeth, with a projecting of<br>\
the upper over the lower: (JK:) or length of the<br>\
upper incisors exceeding that of the lower, (S, O,<br>\
K, TA,) with projection of the former over the<br>\
latter. (TA.) [See also 1, last sentence.]<br>\

or beautiful: (K:) applied to a boy and to a<br>\
girl, (Fr, O, K,) and to a he-camel and to a she-camel: (Fr, O:) and very beautiful or comely or<br>\
elegant; (K;) applied to one and more of human<br>\
beings: (TA:) used alike as masc. and fem. and<br>\
sing. and pl. (O, TA) and dual: (TA:) [and also<br>\
said to be pl. of رَائِقٌ, q. v.:] and it has a pl., [or<br>\
coll. gen. n.,] namely, رُوْقٌ; (IDrd, O, TA;) applied to she-camels; (IDrd, O;) or sometimes<br>\
applied to horses and camels, absolutely accord.<br>\
to IAar, or particularly when on a journey.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A little, or paltry, thing: (JK,<br>\
IDrd, O, K:) of the dial. of El-Yemen. (IDrd,<br>\
O.) You say, مَا أَعْطَاهُ إِلَّا رُوقَةً He gave him not<br>\
save a little, or paltry, thing. (IDrd, O.)<br>\

former as signifying a فُسْطَاط; and its pl. أَرْوَاقٌ<br>\
is expl. in the S as signifying فَسَاطِيطُ;) accord.<br>\
to Lth: (TA:) or a roof in the front, or fore<br>\
part, of a بَيْت [or tent]; (S, O, K;) as also<br>\
↓ رَوْقٌ: (S:) or a curtain that is extended below<br>\
the roof; as also ↓ رَوْقٌ; which latter is expl. in<br>\
the K as signifying simply a curtain: (TA:) or<br>\
the رِوَاق of a بَيْت [or tent] is the curtain of the<br>\
front, or fore part, thereof, extending from the<br>\
top thereof to the ground: (AZ, TA:) a [piece<br>\
of cloth such as is called] كِسَآء let down upon the<br>\
front, or fore part, of a  بَيْت, from the top thereof<br>\
to the ground: (Mgh:) ↓ رَوْقٌ signifies the same<br>\
as رِوَاقٌ: (K:) and each signifies the شُقَّة [or<br>\
oblong piece of cloth] that is beneath the upper,<br>\
or uppermost, شُقَّة of a بَيْت [or tent]: (Az, O,<br>\
K:) or sometimes the رواق is one such piece of<br>\

say, (Mgh, TA,) رِوَاقٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  the front, or<br>\
fore part, of a بَيْت [or tent]; (Z, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ رَوْقٌ; (JK, Z, K;) its hinder part<br>\

called its خَالِفَتَانِ; (TA;) whence the saying,<br>\

sat in] the front or fore part [of his tent]:<br>\
(Z, TA:) and ↓ رَوْقٌ also signifies a tent; as in<br>\
the saying, ضَرَبَ رَوْقَهُ [He pitched his tent]: (S:)<br>\
and [hence] the place of the huntsman [in which<br>\
he conceals himself to lie in wait]; (K;) as being<br>\
likened to the رواق: (TA:) and رواق signifies<br>\
also a place that affords shelter in rain: (MA:)<br>\
[and a portico; and particularly such as surrounds the court of a mosque; (see سُدَّةٌ;) in<br>\
some of the large collegiate mosques, as, for<br>\
instance, in the mosque El-Azhar, in Cairo,<br>\
divided into a number of distinct apartments for<br>\
students of different provinces or countries, each<br>\
of which apartments by itself is termed a رِوَاق:]<br>\
the pl. of رواق is أَرْوِقَةٌ and رُوقٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
the former a pl. of pauc. and the latter of mult.<br>\

-b2-  [Hence, الرِّوَاقُ مِنَ السَّحَابِ, expl. in<br>\
the TA as meaning ما دار مِنْهُ كَرِوَاقِ البَيْتِ: but<br>\
دار is here evidently a mistranscription for كَانَ;<br>\
and the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  The part, of the clouds,<br>\
that resembles the رواق of the tent. See also<br>\
رَوْقُ السَّحَابِ, near the end of the paragraph commencing with رَوْقٌ.] ―<br>\

say, of night, مَدَّ رِوَاقَ ظُلْمَتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [It extended the<br>\
curtain of its darkness]: (S, Msb:) and أَلْقَى<br>\
أَرْوِقَتَهُ (assumed tropical:) [It let fall its curtains]. (S.) [See also<br>\
