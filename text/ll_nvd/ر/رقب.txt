رَقُبَ, (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. ↓ رقْبَةٌ, (JK, S, Mgh, K,) or<br>\
this is a simple subst., (Msb,) and [the inf. n. is]<br>\
رِقْبَانٌ (JK, S, K) and رُقُوبٌ (S, K) and رَقُوبٌ<br>\
and رَقْبَةٌ and رَقَابَةٌ, (K,) He looked, watched, or<br>\

a man, (JK, A,) or a thing; (S;) as also ↓ ترقبهُ;<br>\
(JK, * S, * A, Msb, K;) and ↓ ارتقبهُ; (S, * A, Msb,<br>\
K;) and ↓ راقبهُ, (Mgh,) inf. n. مُرَاقَبَةٌ. (JK, S,<br>\
A, Mgh, Msb.) You say, قَعَدَ يَرْقُبُ صَاحِبَهُ He<br>\
sat looking, watching, or waiting, for his com-<br>\
panion; as also ↓ يَرْتَقِبُهُ. (A.) And كَذَا ↓ أَتَرَقَّبُ<br>\
I look, &amp;c., or am looking, &amp;c., for such a thing.<br>\
(A.) And يَرْقُبُ مَوْتَ صَاحِبِهِ [He looks, &amp;c., for<br>\
the death of his companion], (JK, S, A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) and أَبِيهِ لِيَرِثَهُ [of his father, in order that<br>\
he may inherit his property]: (A:) and ↓ تُرَاقِبُ<br>\
مَوْتَ بَعْلِهَا [She looks, &amp;c., for the death of her<br>\
husband], (K, TA,) لِيَمُوتَ فَتَرِثَهُ [that he may<br>\
die and she may inherit his property]. (TA.)<br>\
And لَمْ تَرْقُبْ قَوْلِى, in the Kur [xx. 95], means<br>\
And thou didst not wait, or hast not waited, for<br>\
my saying [or what I should say]. (JK, TA.)<br>\

You say also أَنَا أَرْقُبُ لَكُمُ اللَّيْلَةَ I will guard, or<br>\
keep watch, for you to-night. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He<br>\
regarded it; paid regard, or consideration, to it.<br>\
(Bd and Jel in ix. 8.) You say, مَا لَكَ لَا تَرْقُبُ<br>\
ذِمَّةَ فُلَانٍ [What aileth thee that thou wilt not<br>\
regard the inviolable right or due, &amp;c., of such a<br>\
one?]. (A. [This phrase is there mentioned as<br>\
proper, not tropical.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  He feared him;<br>\
(A;) and so ↓ راقبهُ; (S, A, Mgh;) namely, God;<br>\
(S, Mgh;) فِى أَمْرِهِ [in his affair]; (S;) because<br>\
he who fears looks for, or expects, punishment<br>\
(يَرْقُبُ العِقَابَ): (A, Mgh:) or اللّٰهَ ↓ رَاقَبْتُ signifies (assumed tropical:)  I feared the punishment of God. (Msb.)<br>\
↓ رِقْبَةٌ [as inf. n. of رَقَبَ app. used intransitively,<br>\
or perhaps as a simple subst.,] signifies (assumed tropical:)  The fearing, or being afraid [of a person or thing]: or<br>\

يُرَاعِيهَا (tropical:)  [i. e. He passed the night watching the<br>\
stars and waiting for the time when they would<br>\
disappear]. (A, TA.) IAar cites the following<br>\
saying of one describing a travelling-companion<br>\
of his:<br>\
النَّجْمَ رِقَابَ الحُوتِ ↓ يُرَاقِبُ<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  He watches (↓ يَرْتَقِبُ) the star, or<br>\
asterism, with vehement desire for departure, like<br>\
the [watching with] vehement desire of the fish<br>\
for water. (TA.) [See also رَقِيبٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  رَقَبَ فُلَانًا<br>\
He put the rope [or a rope] upon the رَقَبَة [i. e.<br>\

إِرْقَابٌ, (Msb,) He assigned the house to him as a<br>\
↓ رُقْبَى [q. v.], (JK, A, * Mgh, K, TA,) and to his<br>\
offspring after him, in the manner of a وَقْف [so<br>\
as to be unalienable]: (TA:) and ↓ ارقبهُ الرُّقْبَى<br>\
[he assigned to him the رُقْبَى]: (Lh, K:) or ارقبهُ<br>\
دَارًا, or أَرْضًا, means he gave to him a house, or<br>\
land, on the condition that it should be the property of the survivor of them two; saying, If I<br>\
die before thee, it shall be thine; and if thou die<br>\
before me, it shall be mine: (S:) it is from<br>\
المُرَاقَبَةُ; because each of the two persons looks<br>\
for (يَرْقُبُ) the death of the other; (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) in order that the property may be his:<br>\
(Msb:) the subst. is ↓ رُقْبَى [signifying, as a<br>\
quasi-inf. n., the act explained above; and, as a<br>\
subst. properly so termed, the thing given in the<br>\
manner explained above: the verb being similar<br>\
to أَعْمَرَ; and the subst., in both of its applications,<br>\
to عُمْرَى: see these two words]. (S, Msb.)<br>\

تَرَقَّبَ see 1, in three places.<br>\

إِرْتَقَبَ see 1, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also,<br>\
ارتقب المَكَانَ He ascended upon the place. (K, *<br>\
TA.)<br>\
رَقَبٌ Thickness of the رَقَبَة [or neck, &amp;c.]:<br>\
(S, K:) a subst. [as distinguished from an inf. n.:<br>\
but see 1, last signification]. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
رَقَبَةٌ.<br>\
رُقْبَةٌ [A pit made for the purpose of catching<br>\
the leopard]: it is, for the نَمِر, like the زُبْيَة for<br>\
the lion. (JK, K.)<br>\
رِقْبَةٌ: see 1, first sentence: ―<br>\
-b2-  and again, in<br>\
the latter half of the paragraph. [Hence,]<br>\
وَرِثَ فُلَانٌ مَالًا عَنْ رِقْبَةٍ (tropical:)  Such a one inherited<br>\
property from distant relations; not from his<br>\
fathers. (K, TA.) And وَرِثَ المَجْدَ عَنْ رِقْبَةٍ<br>\
(tropical:)  He inherited glory, or nobility, from distant<br>\
relations: [it is said of a man] because it is<br>\
feared that it will not be conceded to him on<br>\
account of the obscurity of his lineage. (A.)<br>\
El-Kumeyt says,<br>\
كَانَ السَّدَى وَالنَّدَى مَجْدًا وَمَكْرُمَةً<br>\
تِلْكَ المَكَارِمُ لَمْ يُورَثْنَ عِنْ رِقَبِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [The night-dew and the day-dew that nourished<br>\
his mental growth were nobility and generous<br>\
disposition: those generous qualities were not<br>\
inherited from distant relations: رِقَبٌ being pl.<br>\
of رِقْبَةٌ]: i. e., he inherited them from near<br>\
ancestors. (TA.)<br>\
رَقَبَةٌ The neck: or the base of the hinder part<br>\
thereof: (A, K:) or the hinder part of the base<br>\
of the neck: (JK, S:) or the upper part of the<br>\
neck: (TA:) pl. [of mult.] رِقَابٌ (JK, S, Msb,<br>\
K) and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ رَقَبٌ (JK, S, K) and [pl.<br>\
of pauc.] أَرْقُبٌ (IAar, K) and رَقَبَاتٌ. (S, Msb,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  By a synecdoche, it is applied to (tropical:)  The<br>\
whole person of a human being: as in the saying,<br>\
ذَنْبُهُ فِى رَقَبَتِهِ (tropical:)  [His sin, or crime, &amp;c., be on his<br>\
own neck; meaning, on himself]. (IAth, TA.)<br>\
[Hence also] one says, هٰذَا الأَمْرُ فِى رِقَابِكُمْ (tropical:)  [This<br>\
affair is upon your own selves], and فِى رَقَبَتِكَ<br>\
(tropical:)  [upon thine own self]. (A.) And أَعْتَقَ اللّٰهُ رَقَبَتَهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [May God emancipate him]. (A.) And لَكَ<br>\
رِقَابُهُنَّ وَمَا عَلَيْهِنَّ, in a trad., relating to camels,<br>\
(tropical:)  They themselves, and the burdens that are upon<br>\
them, are thine. (TA.) And [hence], in another<br>\
trad., لَنَا رِقَابُ الأَرْضِ (tropical:)  To us belongs the land<br>\
itself. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence also, i. e. by a synecdoche, (IAth, Mgh, TA,) (tropical:)  A slave, (S, IAth,<br>\
Mgh, K, TA,) male and female: (IAth, TA:)<br>\
and a captive: (TA:) pl. رِقَابٌ. (Mgh.) You<br>\
say, أَعْتَقَ رَقَبَةً (tropical:)  He emancipated a slave, male or<br>\
female. (IAth, TA.) And فَكَّ رَقَبَةً (tropical:)  He released<br>\
a slave, or a captive. (TA.) الرِّقَاب in the Kur<br>\
ix. 60 means (tropical:)  Those slaves who have contracted<br>\
with their owners for their freedom. (T, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  رِقَابُ المَزَاوِدِ (tropical:)  [lit. The necks of<br>\
provision-bags] is a nickname which was applied<br>\
to the عَجَم [or Persians, or foreigners in general]; because they were red; (S, A;) or because<br>\
of the length of their necks; (El-Karáfee, TA in<br>\
art. زود;) or rather because of the thickness<br>\
thereof, as though they were full. (MF in that<br>\
art.)<br>\
رُقْبَى One&#39;s giving to another person a possession, (K,) such as a house, and land, and the like,<br>\
(TA,) on the condition that, whichever of them<br>\
shall die, the property shall revert to his [the<br>\
giver&#39;s] heirs: (K:) so called because each of<br>\
them looks for (يَرْقُبُ) the death of the other:<br>\
(TA:) or one&#39;s assigning it, (K,) namely, a<br>\
dwelling, (TA,) to another person to inhabit, and,<br>\
when he shall die, to another: (K:) or one&#39;s<br>\
saying to a man, If thou die before me, my<br>\
dwelling [or my land, which I give to thee,]<br>\
shall revert to me; and if I die before thee, it<br>\
shall be thine: so called for the reason above<br>\
mentioned. (JK, KT. *) [It also signifies The<br>\
property so given.] See 4, in three places. The<br>\
act thus termed is forbidden in a trad., which<br>\
pronounces that the property so given belongs to<br>\
the giver&#39;s heirs. (JK.) Accord. to the Imám<br>\
Aboo-Haneefeh, and [the Imám] Mohammad, it<br>\
is not a هِبَة: accord. to Aboo-Yoosuf, it is a هِبَة<br>\
like the عُمْرَى; but none of the lawyers of El-<br>\
&#39;Irák says so: the Málikees absolutely forbid it.<br>\
(TA.) You say, دَارِى لَكَ رُقْبَى [My house is<br>\
thine as a رقبى]: from المُرَاقَبَةُ; because each of<br>\
the two persons looks for the death of the other.<br>\
(A.)<br>\
رَقَبَانٌ: see أَرْقَبُ.<br>\
رَقَبَانِىٌّ: see أَرْقَبُ.<br>\
رَقُوبٌ (tropical:)  A woman (S, A) of whom no offspring<br>\
lives, or remains, (S, A, K,) and who looks for<br>\
the death of her offspring, or of her husband<br>\
[app. that she may have offspring by another]:<br>\
(A:) and in like manner applied to a man: (S:)<br>\
because he, or she, looks for the death of the<br>\
child, in fear for it: (IAth, TA:) in like manner<br>\
also a she-camel of which no offspring lives:<br>\
(TA:) or he who has no offspring: (Msb:) or<br>\
he who has not sent before him [to Paradise, by<br>\
its dying in infancy,] any of his children: this,<br>\
says A&#39;Obeyd, is the meaning in the [classical]<br>\
language of the Arabs; relating only to the loss<br>\
of children: (TA:) he who has had no child die<br>\
in infancy: or he who has had children and has<br>\
died without sending before him any of them [to<br>\
Paradise, by its dying in infancy]. (So in the<br>\
explanations of two trads., each commencing<br>\
with الرَّقُوبُ, in the “ Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer ” of EsSuyootee.)<br>\
وَرِثْتُهُ عَنْ عَمَّةٍ رَقُوبِ<br>\
is a prov., expl. by Meyd as meaning [I inherited<br>\
it from a paternal aunt] of whom no offspring<br>\
was living: such, he says, is most compassionate<br>\
to the son of her brother. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
woman who looks for the death of her husband,<br>\
(S, K,) in order that she may inherit his property. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  An old and a poor man<br>\
who is unable to earn for himself, and has none<br>\
to earn for him: so called because he looks for a<br>\
benefaction or gratuity. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A she-camel that does not draw near to the wateringtrough, or tank, on account of the pressing, or<br>\
crowding [of the other camels to it], (S, K,) by<br>\
reason of her generous disposition: (S:) so called<br>\
because she waits for the others to drink, and<br>\
drinks when they have done. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  أُمُّ الرَّقُوبِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Calamity, or misfortune. (K.)<br>\
رَقِيبٌ, of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure فَاعِلٌ, (TA,) A looker, watcher, or<br>\
waiter, in expectation [of a person or thing]:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) pl. رُقَبَآءُ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A guarder,<br>\
guardian, keeper, or preserver: (JK, S, A, Msb,<br>\
K:) a guard of a people; one stationed on an<br>\
elevated place to keep watch: (TA:) a spy, or<br>\
scout, of an army: (A, TA:) a watcher, or an<br>\
observer. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] الرّقِيبُ is an appel-lation applied to God; (A, K, TA;) meaning<br>\
The Guardian, Keeper, Watcher, or Observer,<br>\
from whom nothing is hidden. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also<br>\
The أَمِين of the players at the game called المَيْسِر;<br>\
(JK, K;) or (K) he who is intrusted with the<br>\
supervision of the ضَرِيب [or shuffler of the<br>\
arrows]: (JK, S, K:) or the man who stands<br>\
behind the حُرْضَة [q. v.] in the game above mentioned: the meanings of all these explanations<br>\
are [said to be] the same: pl. as above. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  The third of the arrows used in the<br>\
game above mentioned: (T, S, K:) it is one of<br>\
the seven arrows to which lots, or portions,<br>\
appertain: (TA:) by some it is called الضَّرِيبُ:<br>\
(Lh, L in art. ضرب:) the arrows are ten in number: the first is الفَذُّ, which has one notch and<br>\
one portion; the second, التَّوْءَمُ, which has two<br>\
notches and two portions; the third, الرَّقِيبُ,<br>\
which has three notches and three portions; the<br>\
fourth, الحِلْسُ or الحَلِسُ, which has four notches<br>\
[and four portions]; the fifth, النَّافِسُ, which has<br>\
five notches [and five portions]; the sixth, المُسْبِلُ,<br>\
which has six notches [and six portions]; and<br>\
the seventh, المُعَلَّى, the highest of all, which has<br>\
seven notches and seven portions: those to which<br>\
no portions appertain are السَّفِيحُ and المَنِيحُ and<br>\
الوَغْدُ. (TA.) A poet says,<br>\
إِذَا قَسَمَ الهَوَى أَعْشَارَ قَلْبِى<br>\
فَسَهْمَاكِ المُعَلَّى وَالرَّقِيبُ<br>\
[When love divides the tenths of my heart, thy<br>\
two arrows will be the mo&#39;allà and the rakeeb]:<br>\
by the سَهْمَانِ, [which properly signifies two<br>\
arrows, and hence (assumed tropical:)  two portions gained by two<br>\
gaming-arrows, and then (assumed tropical:)  any two portions,] he<br>\
means her eyes: and as the معلّى has seven<br>\
portions and the رقيب has three, the سهمان would<br>\
gain the whole of his heart. (TA. [See also a<br>\
verse cited voce عُشْرٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b6-  رَقِيبُ النَّجْمِ signifies<br>\
(tropical:)  The star, or asterism, that sets with the rising<br>\
of that [other] star, or asterism: for example,<br>\
the رقيب of الثُّرَيَّا is الإِكْلِيلُ: [and the former is<br>\
the رقيب of the latter:] when the latter rises at<br>\
nightfall, the former sets: (S, TA:) or رَقِيبٌ<br>\
signifies the star, or asterism, which [as it were]<br>\
watches, (يُرَاقِبُ,) in the east, the star, or asterism,<br>\
setting in the west: or any one of the Mansions<br>\
of the Moon is the رقيب of another: (K, TA:)<br>\
whenever any one of them rises, another [of<br>\
them] sets: (TA: [see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل;<br>\
and see also نَوْءٌ:]) and الرَّقِيبُ is (assumed tropical:)  a [certain]<br>\
star, or asterism, of the stars, or asterisms, [that<br>\
were believed to be the givers] of rain, that [as it<br>\
were] watches another star, or asterism: (K:)<br>\
[it was app. applied to الإِكْلِيلُ, as being the<br>\
رقيب of the most noted and most welcome of all<br>\
the Mansions of the Moon, namely, الثُّرَيَّا: see<br>\
نَوْءٌ.] The رَقِيب of الثُّرَيَّا is [also] an appellation<br>\
applied to الدَّبَرَانُ (assumed tropical:)  [i. e. The Hyades; or the<br>\
five chief stars of the Hyades; or the brightest<br>\
star among them,<br>\
α of Taurus]; because a<br>\
follower thereof: (A:) [and] العَيُّوقُ (assumed tropical:)  [i. e. Capella] is so called as being likened to the رقيب of<br>\
the game called المَيْسِر. (TA.) [Hence,] one<br>\
says, لَاآتِيكَ أَوْ يَلْقَى الثُّرَيَّا رَقِيبُهَا (tropical:)  [I will not<br>\
come to thee unless their رقيب meet the Pleiades].<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b7-  رَقِيبٌ also signifies (tropical:)  A man&#39;s successor,<br>\
(A, K,) of his offspring, and of his عَشِيرَة [i. e.<br>\
kinsfolk, or nearer or nearest relations by descent<br>\
from the same ancestor, &amp;c.]. (K.) So in the<br>\
saying, نِعْمَ الرَّقِيبُ أَنْتَ لِأَبِيكَ وَسَلَفِكَ (tropical:)  [Excellent,<br>\
or most excellent, is the successor; such art thou<br>\
to thy father and thine ancestors]: because the<br>\
successor is like الدَّبَرَان to الثُّرَيَّا. (A.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The son of a paternal uncle. (K.) [App.<br>\
because two male cousins by the father&#39;s side are<br>\
often rivals, and watchers of each other; the son<br>\
of a girl&#39;s paternal uncle being commonly preferred as her husband.] ―<br>\
-b9-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A species of<br>\
serpent: as though it watched by reason of<br>\
hatred: (TA:) or a certain malignant serpent:<br>\
pl. رَقِيبَاتٌ and رُقُبٌ. (T, K.)<br>\
رَقَّابَةٌ A low, or an ignoble, man, a servant, or a<br>\
slave, syn. رَجُلٌ وَغْدٌ, (S, K,) who keeps, guards,<br>\
or watches, the [utensils and furniture called]<br>\
رَحْل of a people when they are absent. (S.)<br>\
أَرْقَبُ and ↓ رَقَبَانِىٌّ, (JK, S, A, K,) the latter<br>\
irregular (Sb, S, K) as a rel. n., (Sb,) and ↓ رَقَبَانٌ,<br>\
(IDrd, K,) applied to a man, (S, IDrd, A,)<br>\
Thick, (JK, S, K,) or large, (A, Mgh, in which<br>\
latter only the second epithet is mentioned,) in<br>\
the رَقَبَة [or neck, &amp;c.]: (JK, S, A, K:) the fem.<br>\
[of the first] is رَقْبَآءُ, (JK, IDrd,) applied to a<br>\
female slave, (JK,) not applied to a free woman,<br>\
nor does one say رَقَبَانِيَّةٌ. (IDrd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الأَرْقَبُ is<br>\
also [an epithet] applied to The lion; (K;)<br>\
because of the thickness of his رَقَبة. (TA.)<br>\
مَرْقَبٌ and ↓ مَرْقَبَةٌ An elevated place upon<br>\
which a spy, or watchman, ascends, or stations<br>\
himself: (S, A, * Msb, K: *) [a structure such as<br>\
is termed] an عَلَم, or a hill, upon which one<br>\
ascends to look from afar: or, accord. to Sh, the<br>\
latter signifies a place of observation on the top<br>\
of a mountain or of a fortress: accord. to AA,<br>\
the pl., مَرَاقِبُ, signifies elevated pieces of ground.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَرْقَبَةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
مُرَقَّبٌ A skin, or hide, that is drawn off from<br>\
the part next to the head (S, K) and the رَقَبَة [or<br>\
neck, &amp;c.]. (S.)<br>\
