in great numbers, (M,) and cattle also, (S, K,)<br>\
in consequence of drought (S, Msb) long con-<br>\
tinuing, (S,) wherefore it was thus called, (S, M,)<br>\
because the earth became like ashes by reason of<br>\
the drought; (Msb;) or, as some say, because<br>\
the drought continued so as to render the earth<br>\
and the trees like the colour of ashes: but the<br>\
first reason assigned above, for its being thus<br>\
called, is preferable. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also رَمَادٌ.<br>\
رَمَادِىٌّ A sort of grapes, of Et-Táif, of a<br>\

M, K;) [ash-coloured; ashy;] of a dusty colour<br>\
in which is a duskiness, or dinginess: (S:) [fem.<br>\
رَمْدَآءُ: and pl. رُمْدٌ.] Hence رَمْدَآءُ applied to A<br>\
female ostrich: (S, K:) [and رُمْدٌ applied to<br>\
ostriches: (see 9, last sentence:)] and hence also<br>\
رُمْدٌ applied to gnats (T, S, A, L, K) of a certain<br>\
species: (T:) and you say نَعَامَةٌ رَمْدَآءُ (M, A)<br>\

(A:) and ثِيَابٌ رُمْدٌ garments, or pieces of cloth,<br>\
