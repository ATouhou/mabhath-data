It is said in a prov., كَفَى بِرُغَائِهَا مُنَادِيًا [Her<br>\
grumbling cry suffices as a caller] i. e., the رُغَآء of<br>\
his camel serves instead of his calling in presenting himself for entertainment as a guest: (S:)<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd says that it is well known to the Arabs<br>\
as relating to the accomplishment of an object of<br>\
want before the asking for it: and it is applied<br>\
also to the case of a man whose aid is wanted<br>\
and who does not come to thee; excusing himself<br>\
by saying that he did not know: and to the case<br>\
of one who stands at a man&#39;s door, and to whom<br>\
it is said, “Send him who shall ask permission<br>\
for thee [to go in]; ” whereupon he replies, “His<br>\
knowledge of my standing at his door suffices for<br>\
asking permission for me: if he pleased, he would<br>\
grant me permission. ” (Meyd. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 328—9.]) And in another<br>\
prov., البَكْرِ ↓ كَانَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ كَرَاغِيَةِ, (JK, Meyd,)<br>\
or السَّقْبِ, [i. e. There befell them the like of the<br>\
grumbling cry of the young camel,] meaning, the<br>\
رُغَآء of the young camel of Thamood [which preceded the destruction of those who heard it]: the<br>\
prov. relates to the auguring evil from a thing.<br>\

أَمْسَتْ إِبِلُهُمْ تُرَغِّى وَتُنَشِّفُ, i. e. [Their camels became, or became in the evening, so as that they<br>\
yielded frothy milk; or so as that] they had رَغْوَة<br>\
and نُشَافَة. (Yaakoob, S.)<br>\

ارغى He made his she-camel to utter the<br>\

made his camel to do so in order that he might<br>\
be entertained as a guest. (M, TA. [See a prov.<br>\

El-Fak&#39;asee says,<br>\
وَمَا يُرْغَى لِشَدَّادٍ فَصِيلُ<br>\
[And a young camel belonging to the family of<br>\
Sheddád is not made to utter its grumbling cry<br>\
for the want of its mother]; meaning that they<br>\
are niggardly; that they will not separate the<br>\
young camel from its mother by slaughter nor by<br>\
gift. (S.) And it is said in a prov.,<br>\
أَرْغُوا لَهَا حُوَارَهَا تَقِرُّ<br>\
[Make ye her (the camel&#39;s) young one to utter<br>\
its grumbling cry, then she will be quiet]: for the<br>\
she-camel when she hears the رُغَآء of her young<br>\
one becomes still: (Meyd:) the prov. means,<br>\
give him that which he wants, [then] he will be<br>\
quiet. (JK, Meyd. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov. i. 532.]) أَرْغَوْا لِلرَّحِيلِ means They made<br>\
their saddle-camels to utter the grumbling cry<br>\
[for removal, or departure, or journeying]; camels<br>\
being wont to do so when the loads are lifted<br>\
upon them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, ارغاهُ (assumed tropical:)  He subdued,<br>\
subjected, or oppressed, him; and abased him:<br>\
because the camel [generally] does not utter the<br>\
cry termed رُغَآء except in consequence of abasement, or humiliation. (TA.) ―<br>\

هِىَ مَلِيكَةُ الإِرْغَآءِ (assumed tropical:)  She is the slave (مَلِيكَة meaning<br>\
مَمْلُوكَة) of noise and loquacity, so that she distresses the hearers: or it may mean [she is subject<br>\

loquacity; from رَغْوَةٌ meaning “ froth. ” (TA.<br>\
[See رَغَّآءٌ.]) ―<br>\

one to another, and called one another, against<br>\

ارتغى He drank رَغْوَة, i. e. froth: (S, Msb:)<br>\
or ارتغى رَغْوَةً he took, and sipped, or supped,<br>\
froth. (K.) It is said in a prov., يُسِرُّ حَسْوًا فِى<br>\
ارْتِغَآءٍ [He conceals a sipping, or supping, in<br>\
drinking froth]: applied to him who pretends one<br>\
thing when he means, or desires, another: (S:)<br>\
accord. to AZ and As, it originated from a man&#39;s<br>\
having some milk brought to him, and his pretending that he desired the froth, and, while<br>\
drinking this, taking of the milk; and is applied<br>\
to a man who pretends to aid thee, and benefits<br>\
himself: (Meyd:) Esh-Shaabee, to one who asked<br>\
