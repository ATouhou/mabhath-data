a journey, so went on his feet: (TA:) or he remained going on foot: so says AZ; and Ks says<br>\
the like: (S:) or he was, or became, strong to<br>\

like manner] signifies he went on foot, (S, K,<br>\
TA,) having alighted from his beast: (TA:)<br>\

from his beast:] and ↓ ترجُلوا they alighted<br>\

رِجْلٌ; [so in the CK; but accord. to the rule of<br>\
the K they should be رَجْلَةٌ and رَجْلٌ, as neither<br>\
is expressly said to be with kesr; or the latter<br>\
may be correctly رِجْلٌ, as رَجِلَ is said to be like<br>\
عَلِمَ, of which the inf. n. is عِلْمٌ;] He had a<br>\
complaint of his رِجْل [i. e. leg, or foot]: (CK;<br>\
but omitted in other copies: both mentioned in<br>\
the TA:) the latter verb is mentioned in this<br>\
sense by El-Fárisee, and also on the authority of<br>\
Kr. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And رَجِلَ مِنْ رِجْلِهِ He was, or<br>\

the sheep, or goat, by its hind leg or foot: (S, O,<br>\

by pressing his feet upon its folded fore legs while<br>\
it was lying on the ground], (K,) or, as in the<br>\
M, بِرجْلِهِ [with his foot]. (TA.) ―<br>\

رَجُلَ,<br>\
inf. n. رَجْلٌ, (TA,) He sent the young one with<br>\
her [to suck her whenever he would; as is implied<br>\
by what immediately precedes]; as also ↓ أَرْجَلَهَا:<br>\
(K:) or الفَصِيلَ ↓ أَرْجَلْتُ (so in two copies of the<br>\
S and in the O) I left the young camel with his<br>\
mother to such her whenever he pleased: (S, * O:<br>\
[in one of my copies of the S رَجَلْتُ, which<br>\
appears from what here follows to be a mistake:])<br>\
so says ISk: and he cites as an ex.,<br>\

[Fat, and well nourished: he was left with his<br>\
mother to such her when he pleased until he was<br>\
weaned]. (O.) [See also رَجَلٌ, below; where it<br>\
is explained as though a quasi-inf. n. of أَرْجَلْتُ in<br>\
the sense here assigned to it in the S and O, or<br>\
inf. n. of رَجَلْتُ in the same sense.] ―<br>\

-b3-  رَجَلٌ also signifies<br>\
The act of [the stallion&#39;s] leaping the mare:<br>\
(O, K, TA:) [i. e., as inf. n. of رَجَلَ; for] one says,<br>\

passed the night leaping the mares. (TA; and<br>\
so in the O, except that الخيل is there omitted.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And رَجَلَ المَرْأَةَ He compressed the woman.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A5-  [Golius says that رَجُلَ signifies Vir et<br>\
virili animo fuit; as on the authority of J; and<br>\
that رُجْلَةٌ is its inf. n.: but it seems that he found<br>\
الرُّجْلَةُ incorrectly explained in a copy of the S as<br>\
مَصْدَرُ رَجُلَ instead of مَصْدَرُ الرَّجُلِ: ISd expressly says that رُجْلَةٌ and its syns. (explained<br>\
below) are of the number of those inf. ns. that<br>\
have no verbs.]<br>\
2<br>\
رَجَّلَتْ وَلَدَهَا [app. a mistranscription]: see<br>\
1, in the latter half of the paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  تَرْجِيلٌ<br>\

made the hair to be [wavy, or somewhat curly,<br>\
i. e.] not very crisp or curly, nor lank, (S,) or in<br>\
a state between that of lankness and that of crispness or curliness: (K:) or he combed the hair;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) either his own hair, [see 5,] or that<br>\
of another: (Msb:) or he combed down the hair;<br>\
i. e., let it down, or made it to hang down, by<br>\
means of the comb: (Mgh:) Er-Rághib says, as<br>\
though he made it to descend at the رِجْل [or<br>\
foot], i. e. from its places of growth; but this<br>\
requires consideration: (MF:) or he combed and<br>\
anointed the hair: (TA voce عَسِبٌ:) or he washed<br>\
and combed the hair. (Ham p. 356.)<br>\
4<br>\
ارجلهُ He made him to go on foot; (S, K,<br>\
TA;) to alight from his beast. (TA.)<br>\

of the paragraph, in three places.<br>\
5<br>\
تَرَجَّلَ see 1, first sentence, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
ترجّل فِى البِئْرِ, (S, Msb, K,) and ترجّل البِئْرَ,<br>\
(K,) He descended into the well (S, Msb, K)<br>\
[by means of his feet, or legs, alone, i. e.,] without his being let down, or lowered, or suspended<br>\
[by means of a rope]. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ترجّل الزَّنْدَ,<br>\
and ↓ ارتجلهُ, [or, more probably, ارتجل الزَّنْدَةَ,<br>\
and ترجّلها, (see مُرْتَجِلٌ,)] He put the زند [or<br>\
the زندة; (the former meaning the upper, and the<br>\
latter the lower, of the two pieces of wood used<br>\
for producing fire,)] beneath his feet: (M, K:)<br>\
or ↓ ارتجل signifies he (a man come from a distant country) struck fire, and held the زَنْد [here<br>\
app. meaning (as in many other instances) the<br>\
زند properly so called and the زندة] with his<br>\
hands and his feet, [i. e. the زند with his hands<br>\
and the زندة with his feet,] because he was alone.<br>\
(TA. [See مُرْتَجِلٌ.])<br>\

رَجُل [or man] (K, TA) in some of her qualities,<br>\
or states, or predicaments. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ترجّل النَّهَارُ<br>\
i. q. اِرْتَفَعَ (tropical:)  [i. e. The day became advanced, the<br>\
sun being somewhat high]; (S, IAth, O, K, TA;)<br>\
it being likened to the rising of a man from<br>\
youth; (IAth, TA;) and so النهار ↓ ارتجل: or,<br>\
accord. to Er-Rághib, the former means the sun<br>\
went down from [or below] the walls; as though<br>\
it alighted (كَأَنَّهَا تَرَجَّلَتْ [in a proper sense of<br>\
this verb: see 1, first sentence]). (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And<br>\
ترجّل He combed his own hair: (Msb:) or he<br>\
combed down his own hair; i. e., let it down,<br>\
or made it to hang down, by means of the comb:<br>\
(Mgh:) or he anointed [or washed] and combed<br>\
his own hair. (TA. [See 2.]) Hence, نَهَى<br>\
عَنِ التَّرَجُّلِ إِلَّا غِبًّا (Mgh, TA) He [Mohammad]<br>\
forbade the anointing and combing of one&#39;s own<br>\
hair except it be less frequent than every day.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
ارتجل: see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Said of a<br>\
horse, (in his running, TA,) He mixed the pace<br>\
termed العَنَق with that termed الهَمْلَجَة, (T, TA,)<br>\
or the former pace with somewhat of the latter,<br>\
and thus, (S,) he went those two paces alternately,<br>\
(S, K,) somewhat of the former and somewhat of<br>\
the latter. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  He took a man by his رِجْل<br>\
[i. e. leg, or foot]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\

sense: see 5, in two places.<br>\
-A3-  [He extemporized<br>\
a speech or verses; spoke it or them extemporaneously, impromptu, or without premeditation;]<br>\
he began an oration (a خُطْبَة), and poetry, without his having prepared it beforehand; (S;)<br>\
he spoke a speech (Msb, K) without consideration or thought, (Msb,) or without his having<br>\
prepared it; (K;) he recited it, or related it,<br>\
standing, without forecast, consideration, thought,<br>\
or meditation; so accord. to Er-Rághib [who<br>\
seems to have held this to be the primary signification of the verb when relating to a speech or<br>\
the like]; or without reiteration, and without<br>\
pausing, halting, or hesitating. (TA.) And<br>\
ارتجل الشَّىْءَ [He did, performed, or produced,<br>\
the thing without premeditation, or previous<br>\
preparation]. (TA in art. خرع.) [And ارتجل<br>\
اسْمًا He coined a name.] ―<br>\
-b2-  ارتجل بِرَأْيِهِ He was,<br>\
or became, alone, or independent of others, with<br>\
none to take part or share or participate with<br>\
him, in his opinion, (Msb, K, TA,) without<br>\
consulting any one respecting it, (Msb, TA,) and<br>\
kept constantly, or perseveringly, to it. (Msb.)<br>\
[Hence,] أَمْرُكَ مَا ارْتَجَلْتَ Thine affair [to which<br>\
thou shouldst keep] is that respecting which<br>\
thou art alone [&amp;c.] in thine opinion. (K.) And<br>\
اِرْتَجِلْ مَا ارْتَجَلْتَ مِنَ الأَمْرِ is explained in the T<br>\
as meaning اِرْكَبْ مَا رَكِبْتَ مِنْهُ [i. e. Undertake<br>\
thou what thou hast undertaken of the affair:<br>\
but it may rather signify keep thou to what thou<br>\
hast undertaken of the affair; agreeably with<br>\
what here follows]. (TA.) One says also,<br>\
↓ اِرْتَجِلْ رَجْلَكَ Keep thou to thine affair: (IAar,<br>\
M, K, TA:) in [some of] the copies of the K,<br>\
erroneously, رَجَلَكَ. (TA.)<br>\

detached number (قِطْعَة [or رِجْل]) of locusts, to<br>\

two places.<br>\
-A2-  See also رَجِلٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A3-<br>\
اِرْتَجِلْ رَجْلَكَ, in some of the copies of the K,<br>\

paragraph.<br>\

and the kind leg of a quadruped; in each of these<br>\
senses opposed to يَدٌ;] the part from the root of<br>\

of any animal]; (Mgh, Msb, K:) رِجْلُ الإِنْسَانِ<br>\
meaning that [limb] with which the man walks:<br>\
(Msb:) or the foot of a man [and of a bird, and<br>\
the kind foot of a quadruped: or rather it signifies thus in many instances; but generally as<br>\
before explained: and sometimes, by a synecdoche, it is used in a yet larger sense, as will be<br>\
explained below]: (K:) of the fem. gender:<br>\
(Zj, Msb, TA:) pl. أَرْجُلٌ: (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.:)<br>\
it has no other pl. (Msb, TA) known to Sb;<br>\
(TA;) the pl. of pauc. being also used as a pl. of<br>\
mult. in this instance. (IJ, TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
الرِّجْلُ جُبَارٌ [The hind leg or foot, or it may here<br>\
mean the leg or foot absolutely, is a thing of<br>\
which no account, or for which no retaliation or<br>\
mulct, is taken]: i. e., if a beast tread upon a<br>\
man with its رِجْل, there is no retaliation or<br>\
mulct, if in motion; but if the beast be standing<br>\
still in the road, or way, the rider is responsible,<br>\
whether it strike with a يَد or a رِجْل. (TA.)<br>\
And هُوَ قَائِمٌ عَلَى رِجْلٍ [lit. He is standing upon<br>\

-b3-<br>\
رِجْلُ الجَبَّارِ (assumed tropical:)  The very bright star [3, called by<br>\
our astronomers “ Rigel,” and also called by the<br>\
Arabs رِجْلُ الجَوْزَآءِ اليُسْرَى,] upon the left foot of<br>\
Orion. (Kzw.) [And رِجْلُ الجَوْزَآءِ اليُمْنَى (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\

good for chronic diarrhœa; mentioned in art.<br>\
غرب [q. v.]. (TA.) Also A certain mode of<br>\
binding the udder of a camel, so that the young<br>\
one cannot suck, therewith, nor will it undo:<br>\
(S, K:) whence the phrase صَرَّ رِجْلَ الغُرَابِ, for<br>\
صَرَّ صَرًّا مِثْلَ صَرِّرِجْلِ الغُرَابِ. (TA.) El-Kumeyt<br>\
says,<br>\
صَرَّ رِجْلَ الغُرَابِ مُلْكُكَ فِى النَّا<br>\
سِ عَلَى مَنْ أَرَادَ فِيهِ الفُجُورَا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Thy dominion among the people has bound<br>\
with a bond not to be undone him who desires,<br>\
within the scope of it, transgression]: (S, TA:)<br>\
i. e. thy dominion has become firm so that it<br>\
cannot be undone; like as what is termed رجل<br>\
الغراب cannot be undone by the young camel.<br>\
(TA.) And one says, صُرَّ عَلَيْهِ رِجْلُ الغُرَابِ,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  The affair was, or became, difficult<br>\
to him: (K and TA in art. غرب:) or his life, or<br>\
subsistence, was, or became, difficult to him.<br>\
(TA in that art.) ―<br>\
-b5-  رِجْلُ الجَرَادِ (assumed tropical:)  A certain<br>\
plant, like البَقْلَةُ اليَمَانِيَّةُ [see art. بقل: accord. to<br>\

curved extremity of the bow; (Kh, S, K;) the<br>\
upper curved extremity being called its يَد: (Kh,<br>\
S:) or the part below its كَبِد [q. v.]: accord. to<br>\
AHn, it is more complete, or perfect, than its يد:<br>\
accord. to IAar, أَرْجُلُ القَوْسِ means, when the<br>\
string is bound, or braced, the upper parts of the<br>\
bow; and أَيْدِيهَا, its lower parts; and the former<br>\
are stronger than the latter: and he cites the<br>\
saying,<br>\
لَيْتَ القِسىَّ كُلُّهَا مِنْ أَرْجُلِ<br>\
[Would that the bows were all of them, or wholly,<br>\
of what are termed أَرْجُل]: the two extremities<br>\
of the bow, he says, are called its ظُفْرَانِ; and its<br>\
two notches, its فُرْضَتَانِ; and its curved ends, its<br>\
سِئَتَانش; and after the سئتان are the طَائِفَانِ; and<br>\
after the طائفان, the أَبْهَرَانِ; and the portion<br>\
between the ابهران is its كَبِد; this being between<br>\
the two knots of the suspensory. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
رِجْلَا السَّهْمِ (assumed tropical:)  The two extremities of the arrow.<br>\

phrase is رِجْلُ السَّهْمِ.]) ―<br>\
-b11-  رِجْلُ بَحْرٍ (tropical:)  A canal<br>\
(خليج) of a بحر [or large river]. (Kr, K, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b12-  رِجْلٌ also signifies (tropical:)  A part, or portion, of a<br>\
thing: (K, TA:) of the fem. gender. (TA.) It<br>\
is said in a trad. of &#39;Áïsheh, أَهْدَى لَنَا أَبُو بَكْرٍ رِجْلَ<br>\
شَاةٍ مَشْوِيَّةٍ فَقَسَمْتُهَا إِلَّا كَتِفِهَا, meaning (tropical:)  [Aboo-Bekr gave to us] the half of a roasted sheep, or<br>\
goat, divided lengthwise [and I divided it into<br>\
shares, except its shoulder-blade, or its shoulder]:<br>\
she called the half thus by a synecdoche: (IAth,<br>\
O, TA:) or she meant the leg (رجْل) thereof,<br>\
with what was next to it [for مما يَلِيهَا in the O<br>\
and TA, I read بِمَا يَلِيهَا] of the lateral half: or<br>\
she thus alluded to the whole thereof, like as one<br>\
does by the term رَأْس. (O, TA. [But see what<br>\
here next follows.]) And in another trad., the<br>\
رِجْل of a [wild] ass is mentioned as a gift, meaning (tropical:)  One of the two lateral halves: or, as some<br>\
say, the thigh: (TA:) and it is explained as<br>\
meaning the whole; but this is a mistake. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b13-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The half of a رَاوِيَة [or pair of leathern<br>\
bags, such as are borne by a camel, one on each<br>\
side,] of wine, and of olive-oil. (AHn, K.) ―<br>\
-b14-<br>\
It is also applied by some to (assumed tropical:)  A pair of trousers<br>\
or drawers; and رِجْلُ سَرَاوِيلَ occurs in this sense<br>\
in a trad., for رِجْلَا سَرَاوِيلَ; like زَوْجُ خُفٍّ and<br>\
زَوْجُ نَعْلٍ, whereas each is properly زَوْجَانِ; for<br>\
the سراويل are of the articles of clothing for the<br>\
two legs: (IAth, TA:) this is what is meant by<br>\
the saying in the K [and in the O likewise] that<br>\
الرِّجْلُ also signifies السَّرَاوِيلُ [app. for<br>\
مِنَ السَّرَاوِيلِ الطَّاقُ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b15-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A swarm,<br>\
or numerous assemblage, of locusts: (S:) or a<br>\
detached number (قِطْعَةٌ) thereof: (K:) [or] one<br>\
says [or says also] رِجْلُ جَرَادٍ, (S, TA,) and<br>\
رِجْلٌ مِنْ جَرَادٍ: it is masc. and fem.: (TA:)<br>\
a pl. without a proper sing.; like عَانَةٌ (a herd of<br>\
[wild] asses, S) and خِيطٌ (a flock of ostriches, S)<br>\
and صُِوَارٌ (a herd of [wild] bulls or cows, S):<br>\

TA,) or a young camel, (K, TA,) and a colt,<br>\
(TA,) with its mother, to such her whenever it<br>\

(TA,) A man, as meaning the male of the human<br>\

(TA) [nor رِجْلَةٌ], and ↓ رَجِلَةٌ, mentioned by AZ<br>\
as another pl., but this [also] is a quasi-pl. n.,<br>\
and of it Abu-l-&#39; Abbás holds ↓ رَجْلَةٌ to be a<br>\
contraction, (TA,) and رِجَلَةٌ (Ks, K) and أَرَاجِلُ<br>\
(Ks, S, K) and [another quasi-pl. n. is] ↓ مَرْجَلٌ.<br>\
(IJ, K.) شَهِيدَيْنِ مِنْ رِجَالِكُمْ, in the Kur [ii.<br>\
282], means [Two witnesses] of the people of<br>\
your religion. (TA.) [رَجُلٌ also signifies A<br>\
woman&#39;s husband: and the dual] رَجُلَانِ [sometimes] means A man and his wife; predominance<br>\
being thus attributed to the former. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
And ↓ رَجُلَةٌ signifies A woman: (S, K:) or,<br>\
accord. to Er-Rághib, a woman who is, or affects<br>\
to be, or makes herself, like a man in some of her<br>\
qualities, or states, or predicaments. (TA.) It<br>\

confirms this latter explanation, (TA,) كَانَتْ<br>\
الرَّأْىِ, ↓ رَجُلَةَ, (S, TA,) meaning She was like a<br>\
man in judgment. (TA. [See also مَرْجَلَانِيَّةٌ.])<br>\
The dim. of رَجُلٌ is ↓ رُجَيْلٌ and ↓ رُوَيْجِلٌ: (S,<br>\
K:) the former reg.: (TA:) the latter irreg., as<br>\
though it were dim. of رَاجِلٌ: (S, TA:) [but it<br>\
seems that رُوَيْجِلٌ is properly the dim. of رَاجِلٌ,<br>\
though used as that of رَجُلٌ.] One says, هُوَ رَجُلُ<br>\
وَحْدِهِ [He is a man unequalled, or that has no<br>\
second], (IAar, L in art. وحد,) and وَحْدِهِ ↓ رُجَيْلُ<br>\

O, K, TA: [in the CK, والرّاجِلُ الكَامِلُ is erroneously put for والراَجل والكامل:]) or strong and<br>\
perfect or complete: sometimes it has this meaning, as an epithet: and when thus used, Sb<br>\
allows its being in the gen. case in the phrase,<br>\
مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ رَجُلٍ أَبُوهُ [I passed by a man whose<br>\
father is strong &amp;c.]; though the nom. case is<br>\
more common: he says, also, that when you say,<br>\

↓ رُجَّالَي, (Ks, T, M, AHei, TA,) termed by MF<br>\
an anomalous pl., (TA,) and ↓ رُجَالٌ, (AHei,<br>\
TA,) said by MF to be extr., of the class of<br>\
رُخَالٌ, (TA,) and ↓ رَجِيلٌ, (AHei, TA,) said to be<br>\
a quasi-pl. n. like مَعِيزٌ and كَلِيبٌ. (TA.) Az<br>\
says, I have heard some of them say ↓ رَجَّالٌ as<br>\
meaning رَاجِلٌ; and its pl. is رَجَاجِيلُ. (TA.)<br>\
And رَاجِلَةٌ and ↓ رَجِلَةٌ are applied in the same<br>\
sense to a woman, (Lth, TA,) and so is ↓ رَجْلَي<br>\
[fem. of رَجْلَانُ, like غَضْبَي fem. of غَضْبَانُ]: (S:)<br>\
and the pl. [of the first] is رَوَاجِلُ (TA) and ([of<br>\
the first or second or] of the third, S) رِجَالٌ (Lth,<br>\
S, TA) and رَجَالَي. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Lh mentions the saying, لَا تَفْعَلْ كَذَا أُمُّكَ رَاجِلٌ, but does not explain<br>\
it: it seems to mean [Do not thus:] may thy<br>\
mother mourn, and be bereft of thee. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
نَاقَةٌ رَاجِلٌ عَلَى وَلَدِهَا means A she-camel [left to<br>\

رَاجِلَةٌ The pastor&#39;s كَبْش [or ram] upon which<br>\
he conveys, or puts to be borne, his utensils. (AA,<br>\
O, K.) So in the saying of a poet,<br>\
فَظَلَّ يَعْمِتُ فِى قَوْطٍ وَرَاجِلَةٍ<br>\
يُكَفِّتُ الدَّهْرَ إِلَّا رَيْثَ يَهْتَبِدُ<br>\
(AA, TA,) meaning [And he passed the day]<br>\
spinning from a portion of wool [wound in the<br>\
form of a ring upon his hand], termed عَمِيتَه,<br>\
[amid a flock of sheep, with a ram upon which he<br>\
conveyed his utensils,] ever collecting [to himself],<br>\
and coveting, or labouring to acquire, save when<br>\
he was sitting cooking هَبِيد [i. e. colocynths or<br>\
their seeds or pulp]. (T and TA in art. عمت:<br>\

horse, (S,) or beast, (دَابَّة, K,) having a whiteness<br>\
in one of his رِجْلَانِ [i. e. hind legs or feet], (S,<br>\
K,) without a whiteness in any other part. (TA.)<br>\
This is disliked, unless there be in him some other<br>\
[similar] وَضَح. (S. [See also 2 in art. خدم.])<br>\
The fem. is رَجْلَآءُ, (S, K,) which is applied in<br>\
like manner to a sheep or goat: (S:) or to a ewe<br>\
as meaning whose رِجْلَانِ [or hind legs] are white<br>\
to the flanks, (M, TA,) or with the flanks, (T,<br>\
TA,) the rest of her being black. (TA.) ―<br>\

-A2-  هُوَ أَرْجَلُ الرَّجُلَيْنِ<br>\

two men; or] he has رُجْلِيَّة that is not in the other<br>\
[of the two men]: (T, TA:) or he is the stronger<br>\

case to be like أَحْنَكُ, as having no verb. (TA.)<br>\
أَرَاجِيلُ app. a pl. of أَرْجِلَةٌ, which may be pl. of<br>\
رِجَالٌ, which is pl. of رَاجِلٌ [q. v.] (TA.) ―<br>\

or a large copper cooking-pot: (Ham p. 469:)<br>\
or a cooking-pot of stones [or stone], and of<br>\

مَرَاجِلُ. (Ham ubi suprà.) ―<br>\

on the authority of IAar alone, (TA,) A sort of<br>\
[garment of the kind called] بُرْد, of the fabric of<br>\
El-Yemen: (K:) pl. as above, مَرَاجِلُ; with<br>\
which مَرَاحِل, occurring in a trad., is said in the<br>\
T, in art. رحل, to be syn.: [and ↓ بُرْدٌ مِرْجَلِىٌّ<br>\
signifies the same as مِرْجَلٌ:] it is said in a prov.,<br>\
حَدِيثًا كَانَ بُرْدُكَ مِرْجَلِيَّا<br>\
[Recently thy بُرْد was of the sort called مِرْجَلِىّ;]<br>\
i. e. thou hast only recently been clad with the<br>\
مَرَاجِل, and usedst to wear the عَبَآء: [whence it<br>\
appears that the مِرْجَل may be thus called because<br>\
worn only by full-grown men:] so says IAar:<br>\
it is said in the M that ثَوْبٌ مِرْجَلِىٌّ is from<br>\
الممرجل [i. e. المُمَرْجَلُ, perhaps a mistranscription for المَرْجَلُ]: (TA:) [but] ↓ مُمَرْجَلٌ signifies a sort of garments, or cloths, variegated, or<br>\
figured; (S and K in art. مرجل;) similar to the<br>\
مَرَاجِل, or similar to these in their variegation or<br>\
decoration, or their figured forms; as explained<br>\
by Seer and others; (TA in that art.;) [wherefore] Sb holds the م of مَرَاجِلُ to be an essential<br>\
part of the word; (S in that art.;) and hence<br>\
Seer and the generality of authors also say that it<br>\
is a radical, though Abu-l-&#39;Alà and some others<br>\
hold it to be augmentative. (MF and TA in that<br>\
art.)<br>\
مِرْجَلِىٌّ A maker of cooking-pots [such as are<br>\
