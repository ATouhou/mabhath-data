L, Msb;) and ↓ أَرْعَدَت, (AO, AA, S, L,) but the<br>\

the clouds (السَّحَاب), or of the angel that drives<br>\
the clouds. (K.) You say, رَعَدَتِ السَّمَآءُ وَبَرَقَتْ,<br>\

(Msb: [written in my copy without any syll.<br>\
signs; but it seems to be indicated that it is ↓ رَعَدَ<br>\

used in this sense, and in the sense here following:]) he was affected with a tremour, quivering, quaking, shivering, or commotion; (A, L;)<br>\
as also ↓ أُرْعِدَ, (S, A, L, K,) and ↓ تَرَعْدَدَ, (L,)<br>\

the Ksh and the Expos. of Bd in ii. 18, where it<br>\
is said to be from الاِرْتِعَاد, or as being a cause of<br>\
trembling:] originally an inf. n., and therefore [it<br>\
is said that] it has no pl.: (Bd ubi suprà:) [but<br>\
see what follows, in which رُعُودٌ occurs, perhaps<br>\
as its pl.:] or الرَّعْدُ is the name of an angel who<br>\
drives the clouds [with his voice] like as a man<br>\

yellow, quivering]. (S.) ―<br>\

(S, K: *) so called because he who lays hold upon<br>\
it, when it is alive, trembles with a kind of<br>\
trembling wherewith he cannot restrain himself;<br>\
it is a kind of trembling with a coldness, or chilness, and intense numbness, and formication in<br>\
the limbs, and heaviness, so that he possesses no<br>\
power over himself, and cannot lay hold of anything at all with his hand; the numbness rising<br>\
by degrees to his upper arm and his shoulderblade and the whole of his side, when he touches<br>\
the fish with the slightest touch in the shortest<br>\
time. (So says &#39;Abd-El-Lateef. [See “ Abdollatiphi Hist. Aeg. Comp. ” p. 82; and De Sacy&#39;s<br>\
