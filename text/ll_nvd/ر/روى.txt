اللَّبَنِ, (M, K,) aor. يَرْوَى, (T, S, Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
رِىٌّ (T, S, M, Mgh, * K) and رَىٌّ, (S, K,) or the<br>\
former is a simple subst. and the latter is the<br>\
inf. n., (Msb,) or the latter is an inf. n. and also<br>\
a simple subst., (M, K,) and رِوًى, (S, M, K,)<br>\
the last erroneously written, in [some of] the<br>\
copies of the K, رَوَى, as though it were a pret.<br>\
verb [like رَوِىَ]; (TA;) and ↓ ارتوى and ↓ تروّى;<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K;) all signify the same; (T, S, M, *<br>\
Msb, K;) [or the last probably has an intensive<br>\
meaning;] He was satisfied, or he satisfied himself, with drinking of water [and of milk]; he<br>\
drank thereof enough to quench, or satisfy, his<br>\
thirst; contr. of عَطِشَ. (Mgh in explanation of<br>\
the first.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And رَوِىَ النَّبَاتُ, (M,) or الشَّجَرُ,<br>\
(K,) مِنَ المَآءِ; (TA;) and ↓ تروّى; (M, K;)<br>\
[The plant, or herbage, or the trees, had plentiful<br>\
irrigation: or] i. q. تَنَعَّمَ [i. e., became flourishing and fresh, luxuriant, juicy, succulent, or<br>\
sappy]; (M, K;) or became bright and fresh, by<br>\
reason of plentiful irrigation. (TK.) ―<br>\
-b3-  رَوِىَ<br>\
and ↓ ارتوى and ↓ تروّى are also used metaphorically, as meaning (tropical:)  He was, or became, in a good<br>\
state or condition; and in the enjoyment of much<br>\
ease, pleasantness, softness, or delicacy, of life.<br>\
(Har p. 100.) ―<br>\
-b4-  شَبِعْتُ مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ وَ رَوِيتُ is<br>\
likewise metaphorical, meaning (tropical:)  I have become,<br>\
or I became, disgusted [or satiated to loathing]<br>\
with this thing, or affair. (S * and TA in art.<br>\
شبع.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also a verse cited voce إِلَى, (p.<br>\
85,) in which يَرْوَى is made trans. by means of<br>\
that particle in the place of مِنْ.<br>\
-A2-  رَوَى عَلَى أَهْلِهِ,<br>\
(T, S, M, K,) and لِأَهْلِهِ, (S, M, K,) aor. يَرْوِى,<br>\
inf. n. رَيَّةٌ, or رِيَّةٌ, (accord. to different copies of<br>\
the T, [the former app. indicated to be the right<br>\
by what is said in the next sentence,]) or رَىٌّ,<br>\
(M, [probably also correct,]) He brought water<br>\
to his family: (S, M, K:) [but in the T it is<br>\
implied that the meaning is like that of the phrase<br>\
here following:] رَوَى القَوْمَ, (ISk, T, S, K,) aor.<br>\
as above, (ISk, T, S,) inf. n. ريّة, (so in the TA,)<br>\
He drew water for the people, or party. (ISk,<br>\
T, S, K.) You say, مِنْ أَيْنَ رَيَّتُكُمْ, with fet-h to<br>\
the ر, (S,) or رِيَّتُكُمْ, (so in the T,) meaning<br>\
Whence is your providing of yourselves with<br>\
water? (المَآءَ ↓ مِنْ أَيْنَ تَرْتَوُونَ: T, immediately<br>\
after the latter of the foregoing phrases; and S,<br>\
immediately after the former of them:) so says<br>\
ISk. (T.) And رَوَى عَلَى اليَعِيرِ He drew water<br>\
upon the camel. (M. [See سَانِيَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And رَوَى<br>\
المَآءَ, aor. يَرْوِى, [inf. n., app., رِوَايَةٌ,] He (a<br>\
camel) bore, carried, or conveyed, water. (Msb,<br>\

عَنْهُ, (MA,) aor. يَرْوِى, (T,) inf. n. رِوَايَةٌ; (T, S,<br>\

[as learned, or heard, or received,] from him;<br>\
(MA;) [he related, recited, or rehearsed, the<br>\
tradition, &amp;c., and the poetry, by heart from<br>\
him:] you say to a man, أَنْشِدِ القَصِيدَةَ [ “ Recite<br>\
thou the ode ”]; but you do not say, اِرْوِهَا unless<br>\
you mean thereby Relate thou it by heart. (S,<br>\
TA.) [One says also, رُوِىَ عَنْهُ, meaning It has<br>\
been related as heard, or received, from him.<br>\
And رُوِىَ كَذَا, and يُرْوَى كَذَا, meaning It has<br>\
been related, and it is related, (otherwise, i. e.)<br>\
thus; with the substitution of such a word &amp;c.:<br>\
and often meaning it has been read, and it is<br>\
read, &amp;c. And فِى رِوَايَةٍ كَذَا, meaning According to one relation, or way of relation or relating,<br>\
thus: and often meaning according to one reading,<br>\

رَىٌّ, (M,) He twisted the rope: (M, K:) or he<br>\
twisted the rope well, or thoroughly, or soundly.<br>\

copies of the K, erroneously, الرَّحْلِ, (TA,) He<br>\
bound the man (S, M, K, * TA) with the rope<br>\
called رِوَآء (M, TA) upon the back of the camel,<br>\
(S, K, *) lest he should fall (S, M, K, * TA) from<br>\
the camel (M) in consequence of his being overcome by sleep. (S, M, * TA.) And رَوَيْتُ عَلَى<br>\
الرَّاوِيَةِ, aor. أَرْوِى, inf. n. رَىٌّ, I bound the رِوَآء<br>\
upon the leathern water-bag, or pair of leathern<br>\

it, with the rope [called رِوَآء, as is implied in the<br>\
M]. (M, * TA.) And الرِّوَآءَ عَلَى البَعِيرِ ↓ اروى<br>\
[He bound the رواء upon the camel]; like رَوَاهُ.<br>\
(TA.) And ↓ رواى He bound a load with the<br>\
رِوَآء. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
روّى, inf. n. تَرْوِيَةٌ: see 4, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
and 5. [Hence,] يَوْمُ التَّرْوِيَةِ [The day of providing oneself with water;] the eighth day of<br>\
Dhu-l-Hijjeh; (T, Msb;) the day before that of<br>\
&#39;Arafeh: (M:) so called because they (the pilgrims, T) used to provide themselves (يَتَزَوَّدُونَ,<br>\
T, M, or ↓ يَتَرَوَّوْنَ, Msb, and so in a copy of the<br>\
T, or ↓ يَرْتَوُونَ, S, K) on that day with water<br>\
(T, S, M, * Msb, K) for the aftertime, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) and to rise and go, or when rising to go, to<br>\
Minè, where is no water, [or, accord. to the Msb,<br>\
where was little water,] therefore they provided<br>\
themselves fully with water, or therefore they<br>\
provided themselves with water from Mekkeh for<br>\
the alighting and abiding at Minè: (T, accord. to<br>\
two different copies:) or [it means the day of<br>\
consideration, or thought; (from another signification of the verb, as will be seen from what<br>\
follows;) and is so called] because Abraham<br>\
was considering, or thinking upon, his dream<br>\
(وَ يَتَفَكَّرُ فِى رُؤْيَاهُ ↓ كَانَ يَتَرَوَّى) [on that day],<br>\
and on the ninth he knew [that his dream was<br>\
from God], and on the tenth he desired to act<br>\
[according to his dream] (اِسْتَعْمَلَ). (K. [And<br>\

related to him by heart (رَوَى لَهُ) the poetry, (T,<br>\
TA,) and the tradition, narrative, or story,<br>\
(TA,) until he retained it in his memory, for the<br>\
purpose of relating it by heart [as learned, or<br>\
heard, or received,] from him. (T, TA. *) And<br>\
رُوِّينَا الحَدِيثَ [We had the tradition, narrative,<br>\
or story, related to us by heart; and in like manner, الشِّعْرَ the poetry]. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  رَوَّيْتُ فِى<br>\
الأَمْرِ, (S, K, [though Freytag represents the verb<br>\
as being in the K without teshdeed, and Golius<br>\

He looked into the thing, or affair, or case;<br>\
inspected it; examined it; considered it; or<br>\
thought upon it; (S, M, K, TA;) deliberately,<br>\

[q. v.]: (M, TA:) [and فِيهِ ↓ تَرَوَّيْتُ app. signifies<br>\
the same:] see يَتَرَوَّى in the former half of this<br>\
paragraph, in an explanation of يَوْمُ التَّرْوِيَةِ.<br>\

ارواهُ (M, MA, Msb, K) مِنَ المَآءِ (MA)<br>\
[and من اللَّبَنِ], inf. n. إِرْوَآءٌ; (KL, and Har<br>\
p. 67;) and ↓ روّاهُ (MA, Msb) مِنْهُ, (MA,) inf. n.<br>\
تَرْوِيَةٌ; (KL;) He satisfied him, or made him to<br>\
be satisfied, with drinking of water [and of<br>\
milk]; he satisfied, or quenched, his (another&#39;s)<br>\
thirst, by a drink, or draught, of water [and of<br>\
milk]; (M, * MA, Msb, * K, * KL; *) he did away<br>\

says of a she-camel abounding in milk, هِىَ تُرْوِى<br>\
الصَّبِىَّ [She satisfies the thirst of the young child]:<br>\
because he sleeps in the beginning of the night,<br>\
and they desire that her flow of milk may be<br>\
early, before his sleeping. (M, TA.) [And in<br>\
like manner, ارواهُ is said of water, and of milk,<br>\
&amp;c., meaning It satisfied his thirst.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,<br>\
اروى and ↓ روّى signify also He watered, or irrigated, plentifully a plant, or herbage, or a tree;<br>\

رَوٌّ: see رَوَآءٌ.<br>\
رُىٌّ: see what next follows:<br>\
-A2-  and see also<br>\
art. رى.<br>\
رِىٌّ, said by Esh-Shámee, in his “Seereh [of<br>\

which is anomalous, like رُيَّا, for رُؤْيَا], (MF,<br>\
TA,) is an inf. n. of رَوِىَ: (T, S, M, Mgh, * K:)<br>\
and also (M, K) a simple subst. from that verb<br>\
[meaning The state of being satisfied with drinking of water and of milk; the state in which one<br>\

-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] الرَّوَآءُ is a name of The well of Zemzem.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And رواء, (so in the TA, as from the K,<br>\
and as mentioned by Az on the authority of IAar,<br>\

goods, conveniences, or comforts, of life. (K.)<br>\
رُوَآءٌ [for رُؤَآءٌ, (see رِئْىٌ, in art. رأى,) or of the<br>\

(All three from the T.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The [funda-<br>\
mental] rhyme-letter; (S, M, K;) the letter upon<br>\

وَ أَوْمَتْ إِلَيْهِ بِالعُيُونِ الأَصَابِعُ<br>\
[When the wealth of the man becomes little, his<br>\
friends become few, and, together with the eyes,<br>\
the fingers make signs to him]: (Akh, M:) [when<br>\
two or more letters are indispensable to the<br>\
rhyme, only one of them is thus termed, according<br>\
to rules fully explained in the M and in the<br>\
treatises on versification:] IJ mentions رَوِيَّاتٌ as<br>\
its pl.; but [ISd says,] I think him to have<br>\
stated this carelessly, and not to have heard it<br>\
from the Arabs. (M.) One says قَصِيدَتَانِ عَلَى<br>\
رَوِىٍّ وَاحِدٍ [Two odes constructed upon one rhymeletter; or having one fundamental rhyme-letter]. (S.)<br>\
رِوَايَةٌ [an inf. n. of رَوَى, q. v., when used as a<br>\
subst., meaning A relation, or recital, &amp;c.,] has<br>\
for its pl. رَوَايَا. (JM.) See رَاوِيَةٌ, last sentence<br>\
but one.<br>\
رَوِيَّةٌ A want, or thing wanted: (A &#39;Obeyd, T,<br>\
S:) so in the saying, لَنَا عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ رَوِيَّةٌ [We have<br>\
a want to be supplied to us on the part of such a<br>\
one; meaning we want a thing of such a one]:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, T:) and لَنَا قِبَلَكَ رَوِيَّةٌ [We have a<br>\
want to be supplied to us on thy part; we want<br>\
a thing of thee]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The remainder of<br>\
a debt and the like. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (S,) or رَوِيَّةٌ<br>\
فِى أَمْرٍ, (M, K, *) thus usually pronounced without ء, (S,) [originally رَوِيْئَةٌ,] Inspection, examination, consideration, or thought, of an affair;<br>\
(S, M, K;) without haste: (M:) pl. رَوَايَا. (JM,<br>\
TA.) You say, مَضَى عَلَى وَجْهِهِ بِغَيْرِ رَوِيَّةٍ [He<br>\
went at random, heedlessly, or in a headlong<br>\
manner, without consideration]. (A in art. ركب.)<br>\

روأ.)<br>\
رَجُلٌ رَوَّآءٌ A man whose habitual work, or occupation, is the drawing of water by means of the<br>\
رَاوِيَة [q. v.]: you say, جَآءَ رَوَّآءُ القَوْمِ [The people&#39;s<br>\
habitual drawer of water by means of the راوية<br>\
came]. (T.)<br>\
رَيَّا [originally رَوْيَا] A sweet odour (T, M, K)<br>\
of anything. (T.) One says of a woman, إِنَّهَا<br>\
لَطَيِّبَةُ الرَّيَّا, meaning Verily she is sweet in the<br>\
odour of her body: and hence the saying of Imrael-Keys,<br>\
إِذَا قَامَتَا تَضَوَّعَ المِسْكُ مِنْهُمَا<br>\
نَسِيمَ الصَّبَا جَآءَتْ بِرَيَّا القَرَنْفُلِ<br>\
[When they stand, the fragrance of musk is diffused from them, like the breath of the east wind<br>\
that has brought the sweet odour of the clove].<br>\
(T.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also fem. of رَيَّانُ. (T, S, M, &amp;c.)<br>\
رَيَّانُ [originally رَوْيَانُ] an epithet from رَوِىَ;<br>\
(T, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) Satisfied with drinking<br>\
[of water and of milk &amp;c.]; having drunk [thereof]<br>\
enough to quench, or satisfy, his thirst; contr. of<br>\
عَطْشَانُ: (S, Mgh: *) fem. رَيَّا, (T, S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) in which the ى is not changed into و<br>\
because the word is an epithet; for it is changed<br>\
into و only in a subst., of the measure فَعْلَى, of<br>\
which ى is the final radical, as in تَقْوَى; so that<br>\
if it were a subst., it would be رَوَّى; (S, M;)<br>\
originally رَوْيَا: (M:) as to رَيَّا that is thought<br>\
to be used as the proper name of a woman, it is,<br>\
thus used, an epithet, like الحَارِثُ and العَبَّاسُ,<br>\
though without the article ال: (S, * M:) the pl.<br>\
is روَآءٌ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) with kesr and<br>\
medd., (S,) in measure like كِتَابٌ, (Msb,) masc.<br>\
and fem. (Mgh, Msb.) You say قَوْمٌ رِوَآءٌ مِنَ المَآءِ<br>\
[A people, or party, satisfied with drinking of<br>\
water]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And نَبْتٌ رَيَّانُ and شَجَرٌ رِوَآءٌ<br>\
[A plant, or herbage, and trees, having plentiful<br>\
irrigation: or flourishing and fresh, luxuriant,<br>\
juicy, succulent, or sappy, by reason of plentiful<br>\
irrigation: see the verb]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,]<br>\
رَيَّانُ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  Full of fat and flesh. (JM.)<br>\
And you say وَجْهٌ رَيَّانُ (tropical:)  [A plump face]; an expression of dispraise [app. when relating to a<br>\
man, but not otherwise; for رَيَّانُ, or رَيَّا, applied<br>\
to a youth, or to a woman, or a limb of a woman,<br>\
meaning plump and juicy, is used by way of<br>\
praise]: opposed to وَجْهٌ ظَمْآنُ. (A and TA in<br>\
art. ظمأ.) And اِمْرَأَةٌ رَيَّا المُخَلْخَلِ (assumed tropical:)  [A woman<br>\
full, or plump, in the place of the anklet]. (JM.)<br>\
And فَرَسٌ رَيَّانُ الظَّهْرِ (assumed tropical:)  A horse fat in the portion<br>\
of flesh and sinew next the back-bone on each<br>\
side. (T.)<br>\
رَاوٍ [as the act. part. n. of رَوَى] is used in relation to water [as meaning Bringing, or one who<br>\
brings, water to his family: and drawing, or one<br>\
who draws, water for others: and a camel carrying, or that carries, water; whence the subst.<br>\
رَاوِيَةٌ, q. v.]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] it is used<br>\
also in relation to poetry (T, S, M) and to traditions or narratives or stories (T, M, Mgh, K) [as<br>\
meaning A relater, reciter, or rehearser, by heart,<br>\
of poetry, and of traditions, or narratives or stories,<br>\
learned, or heard, or received, from another]: and<br>\
in like manner ↓ رَاوِيَةٌ, but in an intensive sense<br>\
[as meaning a large, or copious, relater or reciter<br>\
or rehearser, &amp;c.]; (T, S, M, Mgh, K;) i. e.<br>\
كَثِيرُ الرِّوَايَةِ; (T, * TA;) as in the phrase رَجُلٌ<br>\
رَاوِيَةٌ لِلشِّعْرِ [a man who is a large, or copious,<br>\
relater &amp;c. of poetry]: (S:) the pl. of رَاوٍ is رُوَاةٌ.<br>\
(S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also One who has the superintendence, management, or care, of horses (مَنْ يَقُومُ<br>\
عَلَى الخَيْلِ [strangely rendered by Freytag, who<br>\
seems to have read عَلَى الجَمَلِ, “constrictus fune<br>\
et stans super cameli dorso ”]). (M, K.)<br>\
رَاوِيَةٌ A camel, (A &#39;Obeyd, T, S, K,) or a mule,<br>\
or an ass, (S, and so in the K with the exception<br>\
of “ and ” for “ or,”) upon which water is drawn:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, T, S, K: [see سَانِيَةٌ:]) or a camel that<br>\
carries water; (M, * Mgh, Msb;) and then applied<br>\
to any beast upon which water is drawn: (Msb:)<br>\
[but it is disputed whether this be the primary or<br>\
proper signification, or whether it be secondary<br>\
or tropical, as will be shown by what follows:]<br>\
and also a man who draws water (A &#39;Obeyd, T,<br>\
TA) for his family: (TA:) the ة is affixed<br>\
[لِلنَّقْلِ, i. e. for the purpose of transferring the<br>\
word from the category of epithets to that of substantives; or] to give intensiveness to the signification: (Msb:) pl. رَوَايَا [by rule رَوَآءٍ, being<br>\
originally of the measure فَوَاعِلُ, not فَعَائِلُ]. (S,<br>\
M, TA.) Also A مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag]<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, Mgh) composed of three skins,<br>\
(Mgh,) containing water; (M, K;) so called as<br>\
being the receptacle in which is the water borne<br>\
by the camel [thus called]; (A &#39;Obeyd, T;) or the<br>\
مزادة is thus termed by the vulgar, but this<br>\
application of the word is allowable as metaphorical: (S:) or it signifies a pair of such<br>\
water-bags (مَزَادَتَانِ [see مَزَادَةٌ in art. زيد]): (T:)<br>\
[accord. to ISd,] it is applied to the مزادة, and<br>\
then to the camel, because of the nearness of the<br>\
latter to the former: (M:) or its primary application is to the camel: (S, Mgh:) accord. to some,<br>\
its application to the camel is proper; and to the<br>\
مزادة, tropical: accord. to others, the reverse is<br>\
the case: (MF, TA:) the pl. is رَوَايَا, as above.<br>\
(Mgh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says of a weak person who<br>\
is in easy circumstances, مَا يَرُدُّ الرَّاوِيَةَ, meaning<br>\
He is unable to turn back the راوية [or camel<br>\
bearing a water-bag or pair of water-bags,] notwithstanding its being heavily burdened by the<br>\
water that is upon it. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And the Prophet<br>\
applied the appellation رَوَايَا البِلَادِ [The camels<br>\
bearing water for the irrigation of the countries,<br>\
or the water-bags borne by camels for the irrigation of the countries,] to (assumed tropical:)  the clouds, by way of<br>\
comparison. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  رَوَايَا is also applied as an<br>\
appellation to (assumed tropical:)  The chiefs of a people; (IAar,<br>\
Th, T;) as pl. of رَاوِيَةٌ; the chief who bears the<br>\
burden of the bloodwits owed by the tribe being<br>\
likened to the camel thus termed. (T, M. *) A<br>\
Temeemee, mentioning a party that had attacked<br>\
his tribe, said, لَقِينَاهُمْ فَقَتَلْنَا الرَّوَايَا وَ أَبَحْنَا الزَّوَايَا<br>\
meaning [We encountered them, and] we slew the<br>\
chiefs, and gave permission to occupy, or to<br>\
plunder, the houses, or tents. (T.) ―<br>\
-b5-  رَوَايَا also<br>\
occurs in a trad., in which it is said, شَرُّ الرَّوَايَا<br>\
رَوَايَا الكَذِبِ, and accord. to some, it is, in this<br>\
instance, pl. of رَاوِيَةٌ (JM, TA) in the first of the<br>\
senses explained above; so that the meaning is,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The worst of those who carry tidings are those<br>\
who carry false tidings; such persons being<br>\
likened to the beasts so called, in respect of the<br>\
fatigue that they undergo: (JM:) or it is pl. of<br>\
↓ رَوِيَّةٌ; (JM, TA;) and the meaning is, the worst<br>\
of thoughts are those that are untrue, not right,<br>\
nor tending to good: or it is pl. of ↓ رِوَايَةٌ; and<br>\
the meaning is, the worst of relations, or recitals, are those that are untrue. (JM.) ―<br>\
