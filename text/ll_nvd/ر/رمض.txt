vehemently heated by the sun: (S, A, Mgh, Msb:)<br>\

also رَمِضٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also syn. with رَمَضٌ as expl.<br>\
above: see the latter word. (Mgh, TA.)<br>\
سَحَابٌ رَمَضِىٌّ, and مَطَرٌ رَمَضِىٌّ, Clouds, and<br>\
rain, in the end of summer and the beginning of<br>\
autumn: (K, TA:) because arriving at the period<br>\

-b2-  المِيرَةُ<br>\
الرَّمَضيَّةُ The wheat, or corn, that is brought, or<br>\

شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and رَمَضَانُ,<br>\
alone, for the latter, though disapproved by some<br>\
of the learned, occurs in a trad., (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA,) and in poetry, (TA,) but not الرَّمَضَانُ, for<br>\
this is incorrect, (Mgh,) The ninth of the Arabian<br>\
months: (TA:) so called because, when they<br>\
changed the names of the months from the ancient<br>\
language, they named them according to the<br>\
seasons in which they fell, (Jm, S, K,) and this<br>\
month, (Jm, S,) or نَاتِقٌ, (K,) for this was its<br>\
ancient name, (TA,) agreed with the days of<br>\
vehement heat: (Jm, S, Mgh, Msb, K:) [see<br>\
زَمَنٌ:] or from رَمِضٌ said of a man fasting, expl.<br>\
above: (Fr, K:) or because [its effect is as though]<br>\
it burned [and annulled] sins; (K;) from رَمَضَهُ<br>\
الحَرُّ, expl. above; but [SM says,] I know not<br>\
how that is; for I have not seen any one [except<br>\
F] mention it: (TA:) the pl. is رَمَضَانَاتٌ (S,<br>\
Msb, K) and أَرْمِضَآءُ (S, Msb) and أَرْمِضَةٌ (L, K)<br>\
and رَمَضَانُونَ (K) and رَمَاضِينُ, (Yoo, Sgh, L,<br>\
Msb,) like شَعَابِينُ, (Msb,) and أَرْمُضٌ, which is<br>\
anomalous, (IDrd, K,) is asserted by some of the<br>\
lexicologists to be another pl., but this is not well<br>\
established nor received. (IDrd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in<br>\
a trad. that رَمَضَانُ is One of the names of God;<br>\
but this trad. is pronounced by El-Beyhakee to<br>\
be of weak authority; and that it is so is evident;<br>\
as no learned man has transmitted this word as<br>\
such; (Msb;) [except Mujáhid; for] it is related<br>\
that Mujáhid disapproved of forming a pl. from<br>\
it, saying, It has been told me that it is one of<br>\
the names of God: (TA:) if it be so, it is not<br>\
derived (K, TA) from what has been here mentioned; (TA;) or it refers to the meaning of<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The Forgiving; or He who obliterates sins. (K.)<br>\
رَمِيضٌ: see مَرْمُوضٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also Made thin by<br>\
being beaten between two stones: (A:) sharpened:<br>\
(S, K:) sharp: (K, TA:) applied to a knife;<br>\
(Sh;) and to such as is termed شَفْرَة; (S, K;)<br>\
and to a نَصْل [or blade]; (S;) and to a razor<br>\
(مُوسَى), as also رَمِيضَةٌ; (A, TA;) and in the<br>\
last of the above-mentioned senses, to anything:<br>\
(S:) it is of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولٌ: (TA:) or it may be in the sense<br>\
of the measure فَاعِلٌ, from رَمُضَ, though this verb<br>\
may not have been heard. (Sgh, TA.)<br>\
رَمَاضَةٌ: see رَمُضَ.<br>\
أَرْمُضٌ said to be an anomalous pl. of رَمَضَانُ,<br>\
q. v. (IDrd, K.)<br>\
مَرْمِضٌ The place in which a sheep, or goat, is<br>\
dressed in the manner described above in the explanation of رَمَضَ الشَّاةَ. (S, TA.)<br>\
مَرْمُوضٌ Flesh-meat dressed in the manner<br>\
described above in the explanation of رَمَضَ الشَّاةَ:<br>\
(S:) or roasted flesh-meat, such as is termed<br>\
كَنِيس, [a word with which I have not met<br>\
except in this place,] which is nearly the same as<br>\
حَنِيذ, save that what is called by this last epithet<br>\
is divided into fragments, and then a fire is<br>\
kindled over it; as also ↓ رَمِيضٌ. (TA.)<br>\
