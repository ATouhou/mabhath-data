&amp;c.; (Lh, TA;) or رَزَمَتْ, said of a she-camel;<br>\
(S;) aor.<br>\
رَزُمَ and<br>\
رَزِمَ, inf. n. رُزُومٌ and رُزَامٌ; (S, K;)<br>\
He was unable to rise, (Lh, K, TA,) in consequence of his having fallen down by reason of<br>\
fatigue and emaciation, (Lh, TA,) or in consequence of emaciation (K, TA) arising from hunger<br>\
or disease: (TA:) or she stood still, or stopped<br>\
from journeying, in consequence of fatigue and<br>\
emaciation, and was motionless. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
رَزَمَ, (K, TA,) said of a man, inf. n. رَزْمٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He died. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3- رَزَمَ عَلَى قِرْنِهِ He overcame his adversary, and kneeled upon him, (K,<br>\
TA,) and quitted not his place. (TA.) One says<br>\
of a lion رَزَمَ عَلَى فِرِيسَتِهِ [He lay upon his breast<br>\
on his prey, not quitting it]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4- اِرْزِمْ بِهِ<br>\
مَا رَزَمَ Be thou firm, or steadfast, with it as long<br>\
as it is firm, or steadfast: referring to fortune when<br>\
it is severe, or rigorous. (Ham p. 362.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
رَزَمَ بِالشَّىْءِ He laid hold upon the thing. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
شَدِيدَةً ↓ رَزَمَ الشِّتَآءُ رَزْمَةً The winter was, or became,<br>\
intensely cold. (K, * TA.) Hence ↓ نَوْءُ المِرْزَمِ<br>\
[q. v. infrà]. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  رَزَمَتِ الأُمُّ بِهِ The<br>\
mother brought him forth: (K:) and so زَرَمَتْ بِهِ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2- رَزَمَ الشَّىْءَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
رَزُمَ (Msb,<br>\
K) and<br>\
رَزِمَ, (K,) inf. n. رَزْمٌ, (Msb, TA,) He collected together the thing (S, Msb, K) in a garment, or piece of cloth. (K. [See 2.])<br>\

(S, Msb, K,) inf. n. as above, (S, K,) He bound<br>\
the clothes, or tied them up, (S, K,) in رِزَم [or<br>\
bundles]: (S:) he made the clothes into رِزَم.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
3<br>\
رازم الدَّارَ He remained, stayed, or dwelt,<br>\
long in the house, or abode. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2- رازم<br>\
بَيْنَهُمَا He conjoined them two; (K;) [as, for<br>\
instance, two kinds of food, by taking them in<br>\
immediate succession:] he mixed them. (TA.)<br>\
You say, رازمت الإِبِلُ The camels mixed two pastures. (S, TA.) And رازمت الإِبِلُ العَامَ The camels<br>\
pastured upon the حَمْض [or salt, or sour, plants]<br>\
one time, and خُلَّة [or sweet plants] another time,<br>\
this year. (TA.) [In the case of a man,] مُرَازَمَةٌ<br>\
in eating signifies the making a consecutive, or<br>\
successive, connexion [between two things]; كَمَا<br>\
يُرَازِمُ الرَّجُلُ بَيْنَ الجَرَادِ وَالتَّمْرِ [like as when the<br>\
man makes a consecutive, or successive, connexion<br>\
between the eating of locusts and that of dates;<br>\
or makes locusts and dates consecutive, or successive]: (S, TA:) or مُرَازَمَةٌ in relation to food<br>\
signifies the making an interchange, by eating<br>\
one day flesh-meat, and one day honey, (K, TA,)<br>\
and one day dates, (TA,) and one day [drinking]<br>\
milk, (K, TA,) and one day [eating] bread without any seasoning or condiment, (TA,) and the<br>\
like; not keeping continually, or constantly, to<br>\
one thing: (K, TA:) or the intermixing the [acts<br>\
of] eating with thanks, and the mouthfuls with<br>\
praise; (IAar, K, TA;) by saying, between the<br>\
mouthfuls, Praise be to God: (IAar, TA:) or<br>\
the mentioning God between every two mouthfuls:<br>\
(Th, TA:) or the eating the soft and the dry or<br>\
tough [alternately], and the sweet and the sour,<br>\
and the unseasoned, or disagreeable in taste, and<br>\
the seasoned: agreeably with all of these interpretations is explained the saying of &#39;Omar, إِذَا<br>\
أَكَلْتُمْ فَرَازمُوا: (K, TA:) as though he said,<br>\
[When ye eat,] eat what is easy and agreeable to<br>\
swallow with what is unseasoned, or disagreeable<br>\
in taste: (TA:) or mix ye, in your eating, what<br>\
is soft with what is rough, or harsh, or coarse:<br>\
(IAth, TA:) or make ye praise to follow [your<br>\
eating]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3- مُرَازَمَةُ السُّوقِ means The purchasing in the market less than what will make<br>\

4<br>\
ارزمت She (a camel) uttered a cry such as<br>\
is termed رَزَمَة [q. v.] when loving, or affecting,<br>\
her young one: (S:) or she (a camel) uttered a<br>\
cry of yearning towards her young one: (K:)<br>\
and in like manner, ارزمت عَلَى وَلَدِهَا is said of a<br>\
ewe, or she-goat: but sometimes إِرْزَامٌ means the uttering of a cry, or sound, absolutely: and ارزمت<br>\
said of a she-camel occurs in a trad. as meaning she<br>\
uttered a cry. (TA.) One says, لَا أَفْعَلُ ذَاكَ مَا<br>\
أَرْزَمَتْ أُمُّ حَائِلٍ [I will not do that as long as a<br>\
mother of a female young camel utters her gentle<br>\
yearning cry]: (S, K: *) a prov. (K.) And<br>\
hence, i. e. from ارزمت said of a she-camel,<br>\
(TA,) ارزم is also said of thunder, (S, K,) meaning (tropical:)  It made a vehement sound, or noise: (K,<br>\
TA:) or it made a sound, or noise, (S, K,) not<br>\
vehement. (K.) [And it seems that ↓ رَزِمَتْ and<br>\
رَزِمَ signify the same as ارزمت and ارزم said of a<br>\
she-camel and of thunder: for] the inf. n. رَزَمٌ,<br>\
used in relation to a camel and to thunder, signify<br>\
The making a sound or noise. (KL.) ارزمت is<br>\
also said of a cooking-pot, meaning (assumed tropical:)  It made a<br>\
noise by its boiling. (Ham p. 663.) And you<br>\
say, ارزمت الرِّيحُ فِى الجَوْفِ (assumed tropical:)  The wind made a<br>\
sound [in the belly]. (K.)<br>\
رَزِمٌ Rain accompanied by incessant thunder:<br>\
a possessive epithet. (Lh, TA.)<br>\
رُزَمٌ Firm, or steadfast, standing upon the<br>\
ground: (S, K:) and ↓ مُرْزِمٌ and ↓ رَازِمٌ signify<br>\
[the same; or] firm, or steadfast, upon the<br>\
ground: and the pl. of the last is رُزَّامٌ, occurring<br>\
in a verse cited voce رِزَامٌ, q. v. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
The lion; and so ↓ مُرْزِمٌ; (K, TA;) because he<br>\
lies upon his breast on his prey, not quitting it:<br>\
(TA:) or رُزَمٌ (Ham p. 362) and ↓ رَزَامٌ (TA, and<br>\
Ham ibid., [but in the latter without any syll.<br>\
signs,]) like سَحَابٌ, and ↓ رَزَامَةٌ like سَحَابَةٌ,<br>\
[which is of a form denoting intensiveness of signification,] (TA,) are epithets applied to a lion, meaning that lies upon his breast on his prey, (Ham,<br>\
TA,) and growls. (Ham.) Accord. to J, it is<br>\
applied in a verse of Sáïdeh Ibn-Ju-eiyeh to an<br>\
elephant: but accord. to IB, and the Expos. of<br>\
Skr, it is there applied to a lion, as meaning That<br>\
has remained firm, or steadfast, in his place.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رَزْمَةٌ: see 1: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also the next paragraph, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3- أَكَلَ الرَّزْمَةٌ He ate the<br>\
وَجْبَة [or meal that sufficed for a day and a night,<br>\
or for four and twenty hours]. (K.)<br>\
رِزْمَةٌ A quantity remaining in a [receptacle of<br>\
the kind called] جُلَّة, [a meaning said in the TA,<br>\
in art. ردم, to be erroneously assigned in the K,<br>\
in that art, to رِدْمَةٌ,] of dates, amounting to half<br>\
thereof, or a third, or thereabout: (TA:) or,<br>\
accord. to Sh, the third part, or fourth part, of<br>\
a [sack such as is called] غِرَارَة, (Mgh, TA,) or<br>\
thereabout, (Mgh,) of dates or flour: or, accord.<br>\
to Zeyd Ibn-Kuthweh, like قَوْسٌ, signifying the<br>\
quantity of the fourth part of the جُلَّة, of dates:<br>\
(TA:) or, accord. to the Tekmileh, [the pl.]<br>\
رِزَمٌ signifies the [sacks called] غَرَائِر, in which is<br>\
wheat: and hence the رِزَم of clothes [explained in<br>\
what here follows. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A كَارَة [or bundle,<br>\
put in one piece of cloth and tied up,] of clothes;<br>\
(S, Msb, TA;) what are tied up in one piece of<br>\
cloth, (K, TA,) of clothes: (TA:) or clothes,<br>\
and other things, put together [in a bundle]; as<br>\
also ↓ رَزْمَةٌ: (Mgh:) IAmb explains it as meaning the thing in which are sorts (ضُرَوب) and<br>\
mixtures of clothes: and hence the author of the<br>\
K has taken a meaning assigned by him to رِزْمَةٌ,<br>\
which, he says, is also written ↓ رَزْمَةٌ, namely,<br>\
ضَرْبٌ شَدِيدٌ [a vehement beating], altering and<br>\
substituting: (TA:) the pl. of رِزْمَةٌ is رِزَمٌ. (S,<br>\
Msb.)<br>\
رَزَمَةٌ A cry, or sound, (AZ, S, K, TA,) a sort<br>\
of yearning cry, (TA,) of a she-camel, when<br>\
loving, or affecting, her young one, uttered from<br>\
her throat, or fauces, (AZ, S, K, TA,) without<br>\
opening her mouth, not as loud as that which is<br>\
termed حَنِينٌ. (AZ, S, TA.) It is said in a prov.,<br>\
رَزَمَةٌ وَلَا دِرَّةٌ [A gentle yearning cry of a she-camel,<br>\
and no flow of milk]: (S:) or لَا خَيْرَ فِى رَزَمَةٍ<br>\
لَا دِرَّةَ فِيهَا [There is no good in a gentle yearning<br>\
cry of a she-camel with which is no flow of milk]:<br>\
(K:) applied to him who promises and does not<br>\
fulfil: (S, K:) or to him who causes to wish and<br>\
does not act: (A, TA:) or to him who makes a<br>\
show of love, or affection, without proving it to<br>\
be true or without;t its being accompanied by any<br>\
gift. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The cry of a boy, or<br>\
child. (K, TA: but not in the CK.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And,<br>\
accord. to IAar, A vehement cry or sound.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And The cries of beasts of prey. (S,<br>\
TA.) A poet says,<br>\
لِلسِّبَاعِ حَوْلَهُ رَزَمَهْ  تَرَكُوا عَمْرَانَ مُنْجَدِلاً<br>\
[They left &#39;Amrán prostrate upon the ground;<br>\
there being cries of the beasts of prey around<br>\
him]. (IB, TA.)<br>\
رَزَامٌ: see رُزَمٌ.<br>\
رِزَامٌ A man strong and stubborn. (K.) رُزَامٌ,<br>\
[a mistranscription, app. for ↓ رَزَّامٌ, for it must be<br>\
with teshdeed to the ز, as is shown by an ex. in a<br>\
copy of the S, consisting of two verses, of which<br>\
the former here follows,] as an epithet applied to<br>\
a man, means Stubborn, behaving with forced<br>\
hardness or hardiness: it occurs, accord. as some<br>\
relate it, in the saying of a rájiz, [so in the S and<br>\
TA, but correctly, a poet using the sixth species<br>\
of the metre termed السَّرِيع,] which others relate thus:<br>\
↓ أَيَا بَنِى عَبْدِ مَنَافِ الرُّزَّامْ<br>\
أَنْتُمْ حُمَاةٌ وَأَبُوكُمُ حَامٌ<br>\
[O sons of &#39;Abd-Menáf, the firm, or steadfast,<br>\
upon the ground, (accord. to this reading; but<br>\
accord. to the reading that seems to be رَزَّامْ, the<br>\
stubborn, &amp;c., as a sing., referring to &#39;AbdMenáf himself;) ye are defenders, and your<br>\
father was a defender, حَامْ being for حَامٍ]: رُزَّام<br>\
being pl. of رَازِمٌ. (So in one of my two copies of<br>\
the S: in the other copy omitted.)<br>\
رَزِيمٌ A roaring, or growling: a poet says,<br>\
لِأُسُوِدهِنَّ عَلَى الطَّرِيقِ رَزِيمُ<br>\
[There is, or was, a roaring, or growling, of<br>\
their lions on the road]. (S.)<br>\
رَزَامَةٌ: see رُزَمٌ.<br>\
الرِّزَامِيَّةُ A sect who said that the office of<br>\
Imám, after &#39;Alee, belonged to Mohammad Ibn-El-Hanafeeyeh, and then to his son &#39;Abd-Allah,<br>\
and who accounted lawful those things that are<br>\
[esteemed by the orthodox] forbidden: (KT:) or<br>\
a sect of the extravagant zealots of the class of<br>\
innovators, of the schismatics, or followers of<br>\
&#39;Alee, who say that the office of Imám belonged<br>\
to Aboo-Muslim El-Khurásánee, after El-Man-<br>\
soor, and some of whom arrogated to themselves<br>\
divinity, one of them being El-Mukanna&#39;, who<br>\
made the moon to appear to them in Nakhshab,<br>\
and of whose persuasion there is in this day a<br>\
party in Má-wará-en-Nahr. (TA.)<br>\
رَزَّامٌ: see رِزَامٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [الرَّزَّامُ, as an epithet applied<br>\
to the lion, The roaring. (Freytag, from the<br>\
“ Deewán el-Hudhaleeyeen. ”)]<br>\
رَازِمٌ A camel remaining fixed upon the ground,<br>\
(S, TA,) unable to rise, (Lh, S, K, TA,) in consequence of his having fallen down by reason of<br>\
fatigue and emaciation, (Lh, TA,) or in consequence of emaciation (S, K, TA) arising from<br>\
hunger or disease: (TA:) and in like manner<br>\
applied to a man, &amp;c.: (Lh, TA:) and also,<br>\
[without ة,] applied to a she-camel, meaning<br>\
standing still, or stopping from journeying, in<br>\
consequence of fatigue and emaciation, and motionless: (S:) pl. رَزْمَى and رِزَامٌ, [accord. to Freytag رُزَمٌ,] applied to camels. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
مَرْزِمٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, applied to winter, Cold. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
مُرْزِمٌ A prey. (Freytag, from the “ Deewán<br>\
el-Hudhaleeyeen. ”)]<br>\
مُرْزِمٌ: see رُزَمٌ, in two places.<br>\
المِرْزَمُ is a name of The right star [app.<br>\
γ, i. e.<br>\
Bellatrix,] in the left arm of الجَبَّار [or Orion].<br>\
(Kzw. [Golius says, as on the authority of Kzw,<br>\
that it is “ a star in the right shoulder of Orion: ”<br>\
but Kzw says that this star (which is a of Orion)<br>\
is called مَنْكِبُ الجَوْزَآءِ and يَدُ الجَوْزَآءِ; and then<br>\
he mentions that in the left arm, as being called<br>\
المرزم: whence it seems that Golius was misled<br>\
by the omission of some words in a copy of the<br>\
work of Kzw.]) And المِرْزَمَانِ, (S, K,) also<br>\
called مِرْزَمَا الشِّعْرَيَيْنِ, (S,) is the name of Two<br>\
stars [of which one is commonly known as B of<br>\
Canis Major, and the other is app. B of Canis<br>\
Minor, though Golius says, on the authority of<br>\
Ulugh Beg, that the former is in the right hind<br>\
leg of Canis Major,] with the شِعْرَيَانِ [by which<br>\
latter appellation are meant Sirius and Procyon],<br>\
(K,) or one of which is in [or by] الشِّعْرَى [commonly so called, i. e. Sirius,] and the other is in<br>\
الذِّرَاع [by which is meant الذِّرَاع المَقْبُوضَة, i. e.<br>\
the asterism consisting of a and B of Canis Minor]; (S;) or one of them is الذراع المقبوضة<br>\
[mentioned above and the other is الشِّعْرَى (q. v.)<br>\
commonly so called]: thus says Ibn-Kunáseh:<br>\
both are of the stars of rain: and sometimes the<br>\
sing. appellation (المِرْزَمُ) is used [app. as applied<br>\
to Sirius, or to Bellatrix, or perhaps to B of Canis<br>\
Minor]. (TA.) نَوْءُ المِرْزَمِ [means The auroral<br>\
setting of some one of the stars above mentioned;<br>\
for it] is so termed because of its intense cold.<br>\
(TA. See 1.) السَّمَاكُ المِرْزَمُ is another name for<br>\
السِّمَاكُ الرَّامِحُ [The star Arcturus]. (Az and TA<br>\
in art. رمح. [This star neither sets nor rises<br>\
aurorally in the cold season, nor is it one of the<br>\
Mansions of the Moon; but it rises aurorally<br>\
during “ the first of the rains,” the autumnal<br>\
rain, called الوَسْمِىّ.]) ―<br>\
-b2- أُمُّ مِرْزَمٍ (tropical:)  The north<br>\
wind: (S, K, TA:) or the cold north wind: (Skr,<br>\
on a verse of Sakhr-el-Gheí:) from رَزَامَةُ النَّاقَةِ<br>\
meaning “ the [gentle] yearning cry of the she-camel: ” (TA:) or it signifies, (ISd, TA,) or<br>\
signifies also, (K,) the wind: (ISd, K, TA:)<br>\
thus expl. by ISd without any restriction. (TA.)<br>\
مُرَزِّمٌ That has cast, or laid, himself upon the<br>\
around, and remained fixed, or motionless: or<br>\
having [or making or uttering] a sound, or cry:<br>\
and applied to an army, or a military force,<br>\
agreeably with one or the other of these explanations. (Skr, on a verse of Abu-l-Muthellem.)<br>\
تَرَكْتُهُ بِالمُرْتَزَمِ [I left him in the place where<br>\
one cleaves to the ground; or] I made him to<br>\
cleave to the ground. (K.)<br>\
