signification: see رَزَانَةٌ below. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,]<br>\
(tropical:)  He (a man) was, or became, grave, staid, steady,<br>\
sedate, or calm; (S, MA, K, TA;) and forbearing: and still, or motionless: (S, * K, * TA:) or<br>\

with fet-h to the ز,] He remained, stayed, dwelt,<br>\

-A3-  رَزَنَهُ, (S, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
رَزُنَ, inf. n. رَزْنٌ, (S,) He lifted it (namely, a<br>\
thing, S) in order that he might see what was its<br>\
weight. (S, K.) ―<br>\

the stone from the ground. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
رَزَّنَ [رزّنهُ, inf. n. تَرْزِينٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He pronounced him,<br>\
or held or reckoned him, to be grave, staid, steady,<br>\
sedate, or calm:] the inf. n. تَرْزِينٌ is syn. with<br>\

ترزّن i. q. تَوَقَّرَ (assumed tropical:)  [He showed, exhibited, or<br>\

نُقَرٌ [pl. of نُقْرَةٌ] in stone, or in rugged ground,<br>\
that retain the water [of the rain]; and so is<br>\
↓ رِزْنٌ; or, accord. to Ibn-Hamzeh, this latter<br>\
only; and thus says IB, because a noun of the<br>\
measure فَعْلٌ has not a pl. of the measure أَفْعَالٌ,<br>\
except in a few instances. (TA.) [The pl.]<br>\
رُزَونٌ also signifies The remains of a torrent in<br>\

friendly associate; or true, or sincere, friendly<br>\
associate]. (So in the K accord. to the TA<br>\
[which is followed in this instance, as generally,<br>\
in the TK: but the former I regard as the true<br>\
reading, from رَزَنَ بِالمَكَانِ q. v.].)<br>\
