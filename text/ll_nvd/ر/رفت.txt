رَفَتَهُ, (T, M, A, K,) aor.<br>\
رَفِتَ and<br>\
رَفُتَ, (M, K,) inf. n.<br>\
رَفْتٌ, (M,) He broke it; (T, M, K;) or broke it<br>\
in pieces: (T:) he crushed, bruised, brayed, or<br>\
pounded, it: (M, K:) he crumbled it, or broke<br>\
it into small pieces, with his hand, like as is done<br>\
with lumps of dry clay, and old and decayed<br>\
bones. (A.) And رُفِتَ It was broken; or broken<br>\
in pieces; [&amp;c.] (Akh, S.) You say, رَفَتَ عُنُقَهُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
رَفِتَ, inf. n. as above, He broke, or crushed, his<br>\
neck. (Lh, M.) And رَفَتَ عِظَامَ الجَزُورِ He broke<br>\
the bones of the slaughtered camel, in order to<br>\
cook them and to extract their grease. (T.) And<br>\
one says of him who does that from which he<br>\
finds it difficult to liberate himself, الضَّبُعُ تَرْقُتُ<br>\
العِظَامَ وَلَا تَعْرِفُ قَدْرَ اسْتِهَا تَأْكُلُهَا ثُمَّ يَعْسُرُ عَلَيْهَا<br>\
خُرُوجُهَا [The hyena breaks in pieces the bones,<br>\
but knows not the size of its anus: it eats them;<br>\
then their exit becomes difficult to it]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] رَفَتَ العَطَشَ (assumed tropical:)  It (water) broke the vehemence of thirst. (Z, TA in art. فرت.)<br>\
-A2-  (See<br>\
also 9.)<br>\
2<br>\
رفّتهُ, inf. n. تَرْفِيتٌ, He broke it [app. much,<br>\
or into many pieces]: ―<br>\
-b2-  and hence, (assumed tropical:)  He dishonoured, despised, or condemned, him; تَرْفِيتٌ<br>\
being syn. with تَحْقِيرٌ, and contr. of تَرْفِيلٌ and<br>\
تَعْظِيمٌ. (Er-Rághib, TA. *)<br>\
9<br>\
ارفتّ, as also ↓ رَفَتَ, (M, K,) the latter being<br>\
intrans. as well as trans., (K, * TA,) It was, or<br>\
became, broken, broken in pieces, crushed, bruised,<br>\
brayed, or pounded: (M, K:) said of a bone;<br>\
i. e., it became what is termed رُفَاتٌ. (M.) And<br>\
It became cut or broken, cut off or broken off;<br>\
it broke, or broke off: (K, TA:) the former is<br>\
said, in this sense, of a rope. (A, TA.)<br>\
رُفَتٌ i. q. تِبْنٌ [i. e. Straw; or straw that has<br>\
been trodden, or thrashed, and cut: also written<br>\
رُفَّةٌ, and رُفَةٌ, and رُفَةٌ]. (IAar, T, K.) It is said<br>\
in a prov., أَنَا أَغْنَى عَنْكَ مِنَ التُّفَهِ عَنِ الرُّفَتِ,<br>\
(TA,) or إِلَى الرُّفَتِ (T,) [I am more free from<br>\
the want of thee than the badger is from the want<br>\
of straw, or cut straw]: the تفه is what is called<br>\
عَنَاقُ الأَرْضِ, which has a canine tooth, and does<br>\
not procure for itself straw nor herbage; and the<br>\
word is written with ه; but الرفت is with ت:<br>\
(T:) or, accord. to ISk, the two words are correctly without teshdeed, and with the radical ه.<br>\
(TA in art. تفه.) [See also رُفَهٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  Also One<br>\
who breaks, breaks in pieces, crushes, bruises,<br>\
brays, pounds, or crumbles, anything, or everything. (K, * TA.)<br>\
رِفْتَةٌ A mode, or manner, of breaking, breaking<br>\
in pieces, crushing, &amp;c. (Lh, M.)<br>\
رُفَاتٌ A thing, (M,) an old and decayed bone,<br>\
(A, TA,) or anything, (L, TA,) broken, broken<br>\
in pieces, crushed, bruised, brayed, or pounded;<br>\
(M, L, TA;) or crumbled, or broken into small<br>\
pieces with the hand; (A, TA;) or a thing that<br>\
has become old and worn out, and crumbled, or<br>\
broken into small pieces: (&#39;Ináyeh, TA: [see<br>\
مَرْفُوتٌ:]) or broken, or crumbled, particles;<br>\
fragments, or crumbs; of a thing that is dry,<br>\
(T, S, A, K, TA,) of any kind; (T;) [as, for<br>\
instance,] of musk. (A, TA.) Hence, in the Kur<br>\
[xvii. 52 and 100], أَئِذَا كُنَّا عِظَامًا وَرُفَاتًا When<br>\
we shall have become bones and broken particles?<br>\
(S, M, TA.) [Hence also the phrase] لَا بِرْفَاتِكَ,<br>\
meaning No, by thy ancestors who have become<br>\
broken and crumbled bones in the dust. (Har<br>\
p. 634.) And [hence one says,] هُوَ الَّذِى أَعَادَ<br>\
المَكَارِمَ وَأَحْيَا رُفَاتَهَا وَأَنْشَرَ أَمْوَاتَهَا (tropical:)  [He is the person<br>\
who has restored generous qualities or actions,<br>\
and revived such of them as had decayed, and<br>\
brought to life again such of them as had become<br>\
dead]. (A, TA.)<br>\
مَرْفُوتٌ Broken, broken in pieces, &amp;c. (Akh, S.<br>\
[See رُفَاتٌ.])<br>\
