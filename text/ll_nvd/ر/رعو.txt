رَعَا, aor. يَرْعُو, (S, TA,) [He refrained,<br>\
forbore, or abstained: or, used elliptically,] he<br>\
refrained, forbore, or abstained, (S, TA,) from<br>\
things, or affairs, (S,) or from ignorance, and<br>\
reverted therefrom in a good manner; (TA;) [as<br>\
also ↓ اِرْعَوَى; (K;) [for] رَعْوٌ and رِعْوٌ and رُعُوٌ (K)<br>\
and رَعْوَةٌ and رِعْوَةٌ (S, K) and رُعْوَةٌ (K) are syn.<br>\
with ↓ اِرْعِوَآءٌ (S, K) meaning the refraining, forbearing, or abstaining, from ignorance, and reverting therefrom in a good manner, (K, TA,) [all<br>\

&amp;c.]. (S.) ↓ اِرْعَوَى is of the measure اِفْعَلَلَ [for<br>\
اِفْعَلَّ]; the two infirm letters not being incorporated, one into the other, because the ى is<br>\
quiescent: (S: [see also Ham p. 220:]) you say,<br>\
عَنِ القَبِيحِ ↓ ارعوى, (S, Msb,) or عن الجَهْلِ,<br>\
(Ham ubi suprà,) He refrained, forbore, or<br>\
abstained, from bad, or foul, conduct, (S, Msb,)<br>\
or from ignorance, and reverted therefrom:<br>\
(Ham:) and ↓ ارعوى [alone] signifies He refrained, forbore, or abstained; and he repented:<br>\
(Har p. 240:) [see also an ex. in a verse cited<br>\
voce أَلَا:] accord. to AHei, it is quasi-pass. of<br>\

caused him to refrain, forbear, or abstain, &amp;c.]<br>\
