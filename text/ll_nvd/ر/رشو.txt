رَشَا, said of a young bird, It stretched forth<br>\
its head to its mother in order that she should<br>\
put food into its beak. (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás [Th],<br>\
Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, [accord. to Th, but see<br>\
رِشْوٌة, below,] رَشَاهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. ويَرْشُو,<br>\
inf. n. رَشْوٌ, (S, Msb,) He gave him a رِشْوَة [or<br>\
bribe]. (S, * Mgh, Msb, K.) [See also 3.]<br>\
3<br>\
راشاهُ, (S, ISd, K,) inf. n. مُرَاشَاةٌ, (TA,) i. q.<br>\
صَانَعَهُ [He bribed him; (see also 1;) or endeavoured to conciliate him; or did to him a thing<br>\
in order that he (the latter) might do to him (the<br>\
former) another thing]: (K:) and حَابَاهُ [app. as<br>\
meaning he treated him, or behaved towards him,<br>\
with partiality]: (ISd, K:) or ظَاهَرَهُ [he aided<br>\
him, or assisted him]. (S.)<br>\
4<br>\
ارشى الدَّلْوَ He put a رِشَآء [or rope]. to the<br>\
bucket. (S, ISd, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ارشى said of<br>\
the colocynth [or any similar plant (see رِشَآءٌ)]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  It extended its rope-like branches [or stalks].<br>\
(Az, S, K, ↓ TA.)<br>\
-A2-  أَرْشَيْتُ الفَصِيلَ, (S, K,) inf. n.<br>\
إِرْشَآءٌ, (S,) I made the young camel to suck, or to<br>\
be suckled. (S, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
ترشّاهُ He was soft, tender, gentle, bland, or<br>\
mild, towards him; or he treated him with gentleness, or blandishment. (S, ISd, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
ارتشى He took, or received, a رِشْوَة [or<br>\
bribe], (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) مِنْهُ from him. (Mgh.)<br>\
10<br>\
استرشى He sought, or desired, to be suchled; said of a young camel. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
استرشى مَا فِى الضَّرْعِ He drew forth what was<br>\
in the udder. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, probably,]<br>\
استرشى فِى حُكْمِهِ He sought, or desired, or demanded, a رِشْوَة [or bribe] in the case of his deciding judicially, for his doing so [agreeably with<br>\
the desire of the briber]. (S, K, ↓ TA.)<br>\
رِشْوَةٌ and رُشْوَةٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and<br>\
رَشْوَةٌ, (Lth, K,) of which the first is that which is<br>\
the most commonly used, (TA,) i. q. جُعْلٌ [as<br>\
meaning A bribe]; (K, TA;) i. e. (TA) a thing<br>\
that one gives to a judge, or to another person, in<br>\
order that he may judge in his [the giver&#39;s]<br>\
favour, or to incite him to do what he [the giver]<br>\
desires; (Msb, TA;) or a means of attaining that<br>\
which one wants, by bribery; not including what<br>\
is given as a means of obtaining a right or repelling a wrong; for it is related on the authority<br>\
of several of the leading doctors of the Tábi&#39;ees<br>\
that there is no harm in man&#39;s bribing for the<br>\
defence of himself and his property when he fears<br>\
being wronged; so says IAth: and Lth explains<br>\
the last of these three words as meaning an act of<br>\
bribery: (TA:) accord. to Abu-l-&#39;Abbás [i. e.<br>\
Th], (TA), the former meaning is from رَشَا said<br>\
of a young bird, explained in the first sentence of<br>\
this art.: (Msb, TA:) or it is from الرِّشَآءُ, (IAth,<br>\
Mgh, TA,) signifying “ that by means of which<br>\
one obtains water,” (IAth, TA,) or “ the rope of<br>\
the bucket: ” (Mgh:) or, accord. to ISd, the<br>\
reverse of this is the case: (TA:) the pl. (of the<br>\
first, Msb, TA) is رِشًا or رِشًى and (of the second,<br>\
Msb, TA) رُشًا or رُشًى. (S, Msb, K, TA.)<br>\
رِشَآءٌ A rope: (S, Msb, K:) [or a well-rope;<br>\
i. e.] the rope of the bucket: (Mgh:) and ↓ تِرْشَآءٌ,<br>\
also, with kesr, has the same meaning as رِشَآءٌ:<br>\
(K:) hence it would seem that this is generally<br>\
the case; but they have expressly declared that<br>\
the latter word has not been heard except in<br>\
relation to the like of an enchantment, or a fascination: so says MF, pointing to the saying of<br>\
Lh, that among the phrases of women who enchant, or fascinate, men is أَخَّذْتُهُ بِدُبَّآء مُمَلَّأٍ مِنَ<br>\
المَآء مُعَلَّقٍ بِتِرْشَآء [I have enchanted him, or fascinated him, with a gourd, filled with water,<br>\
suspended by a rope, or well-rope]; and that<br>\
ترشاء, meaning a rope, is not thus said except in<br>\
this enchantment, or fascination: accord. to ISd,<br>\
the last radical of رشاء is judged to be و because<br>\
one obtains water by means of the رشاء, like as<br>\
one obtains the thing sought by means of the<br>\
رِشْوَة; which is the reverse what has been said<br>\
above, that الرشوة is from الرشاء: (TA:) the pl. is<br>\
أَرْشِيَةٌ. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الرَّشَآءُ is also the<br>\
name of (assumed tropical:)  A Mansion of the Moon; (K, TA;)<br>\
[the Twenty-eighth, which is the last, of the Mansions of the Moon;] so called as being likened to<br>\
a rope; (TA;) [the northern fish, of the constel-lation Pisces, together with the star beta of Andromeda; or, more correctly, delta and epsilon, with some<br>\
neighbouring stars, of Pisces;] a group of many<br>\
stars, in the form of a fish, with the tail towards<br>\
the south and the head towards the north;<br>\
(Kzw;) many small stars, in the form of a fish,<br>\
called [also] بَطْنُ الحُوتِ, in the navel of which<br>\
is a bright star, which the moon makes one of its<br>\
mansions; (S, TA;) [or including بطن الحوت,<br>\
which is in the navel of Andromeda; for] بطن<br>\
الحوت is the name of the bright star [beta] that is<br>\
above the drapery round the waist of Andromeda:<br>\
(Kzw, descr. of Andromeda:] الرشاء is also called<br>\
قَلْبُ الحُوتِ. (TA in art. قلب.) [See مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ,<br>\
in art. نزل.]<br>\
رَشِىٌّ A young camel; syn. فَصِيلٌ. (K.) [See<br>\
4, last sentence.]<br>\
رَاشٍ The giver of a رِشْوَة [or bribe]: hence the<br>\
trad., لَعَنَ اللّٰهُ الرَّاشِىَ وَالمُرْتَشِىَ وَالرَّائِشَ, i. e.<br>\
[May God curse] the giver of a رِشْوَة, who aids<br>\
another to do what is wrong, and the receiver<br>\
thereof, and him who is agent between them two,<br>\
demanding more for this or less for this. (IAth,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
تِرْشَآءٌ: see رِشَآءٌ, first sentence.<br>\
مُرْتَشٍ The receiver of a رِشْوَة [or bribe]. (IAth,<br>\
TA.) [See an ex. above, voce رَاشٍ.]<br>\
مُسْتَرْشٍ A seeker, desirer, or demander, of a<br>\
رِشْوَة [or bribe]. (TK.) Hence, (TK,) one says,<br>\
إِنَّكَ لَمُسْتَرْشٍ لِفُلَانٍ, [in the TA إِلَى فُلَانٍ,] i. e.<br>\
مُطِيعٌ لَهُ تَابِعٌ لِمَسَرَّتِهِرص [app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  Verily thou<br>\
art obedient to such a one, subservient to that<br>\
which gives him happiness]. (K, TK.)<br>\
