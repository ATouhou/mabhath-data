رَهَنَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
رَهَنَ, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. رَهْنٌ, (S, TA,) or رُهُونٌ, (Msb,) It (a thing,<br>\
S, Msb, TA) continued, subsisted, lasted, endured,<br>\
remained, or remained fixed or stationary; it was,<br>\
or became, permanent, constant, firm, steady, stead<br>\
fast, stable, fixed, fast, settled, or established. (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K, TA.) This is the primary signification.<br>\
(Mgh, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (Mgh,) رَهَنَ بِالمَكَانِ<br>\
(tropical:)  He remained, stayed, dwelt, or abode, in the place.<br>\
(A, Mgh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And رَهَنَ, (JK, S, K,) aor.<br>\
رَهَنَ,<br>\
(K, TA,) or<br>\
رَهُنَ, (JK, [but this I think to be a mis<br>\
take,]) inf. n. رُهُونٌ, (K,) said of a man, and of a<br>\
camel, (JK, S, * TA,) and of any beast (TA,) He was,<br>\
or became, lean, or emaciated; (JK, S, K, TA;) and<br>\
fatigued, tired, weary, or jaded. (JK, TA.) You say,<br>\
رَكِبَ حَتَّى رَهَنَ He rode until he became lean, or<br>\
emaciated. (ISh, TA. [See رَاهِنٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  As trans.,<br>\
see 4, first signification. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] as a law<br>\
term, رَهْنٌ signifies The putting, or placing, an<br>\
article of real property [to remain] as a pledge,<br>\
or security, or making it to be such, for a debt<br>\
that is obligatory or that will become obligatory.<br>\
(TA.) You say, رَهَنَهُ الشَّىْءَ, and رَهَنَهُ عِنْدَهُ, (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
رَهَنَ, (K,) inf. n. رَهْنٌ (Msb,<br>\
TA) [and رَهِينَةٌ, q. v. voce رَهْنٌ]; and ↓ ارهنهُ<br>\
الشَّىْءَ; (S, K;) all signify the same; (S;) i. e.<br>\
He deposited the thing with him (Msb, K) [as a<br>\
pledge] to be in lieu of that which he had taken,<br>\
or received, from him: (K:) [i. e. he pledged the<br>\
thing to him, or with him:] and رَهَنْتُ المَتَاعَ<br>\
بِالدَّيْنِ, inf. n. رَهْنٌ, I restricted the commodity<br>\
or placed it in custody, for, or by reason of, the<br>\
debt; and بالدين ↓ ارهنتهُ is a dial. var. thereof,<br>\
but of rare occurrence, and disallowed by those<br>\
who are held in esteem: (Msb:) for, properly,<br>\
they say, (Msb,) زَيْدًا الثَّوْبَ ↓ أَرْهَنْتُ signifies I<br>\
gave to Zeyd the garment, or piece of cloth, in<br>\
order that he should deposit it as a pledge (Msb,<br>\
K *) with some one. (Msb.) &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn<br>\
Hemmám Es-Saloolee says, (S,) or Hemmám<br>\
Ibn-Murrah, (TA,)<br>\
مَالِكَا ↓ نَجَوْتُ وَ أَرْهَنْتُهُمْ  فَلَمَّا خَشِيتُ أَظَافِيرَهُمْ<br>\
[And when I dreaded their nails, I escaped, and<br>\
gave them, or left with them, as a pledge, Málik]:<br>\
thus, says Th, all relate the verse, except As, who<br>\
says وَ أَرْهَنُهُمْ مالكا [i. e. leaving with them, as a<br>\
pledge, Málik]: he likens this phrase to the say<br>\
ing قُمْتُ وَ أَصُكُّ وَجْهَهُ; and this is a good way of<br>\
explaining it; for the و is that which is a deno<br>\
tative of state; the meaning being صَاكًّا وَجْهَهُ:<br>\
[accord. to the former reading, in the opinion of<br>\
Th,] the poet means I left Málik remaining with<br>\
them; not as a pledge; because [when the leaving<br>\
a thing as a pledge is meant, in his opinion,] one<br>\
does not say, الشَّىْءَ ↓ أَرْهَنْتُ, but only رَهَنْتُهُ. (S,<br>\
TA.) [See, however, 4.] You say also, رَهَنَهُ عَنْهُ,<br>\
inf. n. رَهْنٌ, meaning He made him, or it, to be a<br>\
pledge in lieu of him, or it: a poet, asserted by<br>\
IJ to be a pagan, says,<br>\
اِرْهَنْ بَنِيكَ عَنْهُمُ أَرْهَنْ بَنِىْ<br>\
[Make thou thy sons to be pledges in lieu of them:<br>\
in that case I will make my sons to be pledges:<br>\
بَنِى being for بَنِىَّ]. (TA.) And رَهَنْتُهُ لِسَانِى (assumed tropical:)  [I<br>\
made my tongue to be as though it were a pledge<br>\
to him, to be restrained, or to be used, for his<br>\
sake or benefit]: in this case one should not say<br>\
↓ أَرْهَنْتُهُ; (IAar, K;) though one says thus of a<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth, [&amp;c.,] as well as رَهَنْتُهُ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
رَاهُنْتُ فُلَانًا عَلَى كَذَا, (S, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
مُرَاهَنَةٌ, (S,) or رِهَانٌ, (Msb,) or both, (K, and so<br>\
in a copy of the S,) I laid a bet, or wager, or<br>\
stake, with such a one, for such a thing, (S,<br>\
Msb, K, *) mostly (TA) said in relation to horses<br>\
running a race, (JK, TA, *) to be taken by him<br>\
who should outstrip, or overcome. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
The inf. ns. also signify (tropical:)  The contending [of two<br>\
persons] to outstrip [in a race] upon horses, (K,<br>\
TA,) and otherwise. (TA.) Hence the prov.,<br>\
هُمَا كَفَرَسَىْ رِهَانٍ [explained in art. فرس]. (JK.)<br>\
4<br>\
ارهن He made (a thing, Msb,) to continue,<br>\
subsist, last, endure, remain, or remain fixed or<br>\
stationary; to be, or become, permanent, can<br>\
stant, firm, steady, steadfast, stable, fixed, fast,<br>\
settled, or established; (S, * Mgh, * Msb, K; *) and<br>\
so ↓ رَهَنَ; (K;) but the former is the more ap<br>\
proved: (TA:) and also he found it to be so.<br>\
(Msb.) You say, ارهن لَهُمُ الطَّعَامَ, (T, S, K, TA,)<br>\
and الشَّرَابَ, (T, S, TA,) and المَالَ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
continued, or made permanent, to them the food,<br>\
(T, S, K, TA,) and the beverage, (T, S, TA,) and<br>\
the property. (TA.) [And accord. to an expla<br>\
nation of أُرْهِنَتْ (referring to dates), by &#39;Alee Ibn<br>\
Hamzeh, cited in a marginal note in a copy of<br>\
the S, in art. أَرْهَنَ, وهب signifies He prepared<br>\
food, and continued it, or made it permanent.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence ارهنهُ as used by some in another sense<br>\
of رَهَنَهُ:] see 1, in six places. [That it is allowable<br>\
to use it thus may be inferred from phrases here<br>\
following.] ―<br>\
-b3-  You say, أَرْهَنْتُ مَالِى I staked my<br>\
property. (JK.) And أَرْهَنُوا بَيْنَهُمْ خَطَرًا They<br>\
gave, of their own free will, what the party<br>\
approved, whatever were its amount, to be to<br>\
them a stake at a race. (TA.) And أَرْهَنْتُ بِهِ<br>\
وَلَدِى (S, K, *) inf. n. إِرْهَانٌ, (S,) (assumed tropical:)  I made my<br>\
children to be as a stake for him, or it. (S, K. *)<br>\
And ارهنهُ لِلْمَوْتِ (assumed tropical:)  He resigned him to death.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) And ارهن المَيِّتَ القَبْرَ (tropical:)  He deposited<br>\
the dead body in the grave [as a pledge to be<br>\
rendered up on the day of resurrection]. (K, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Accord. to AZ, (S, TA, in one copy of the S<br>\
it is A&#39;Obeyd,) أَرْهَنْتُ فِى السِّلْعَةِ signifies I<br>\
bought the commodity for a dear, or an excessive,<br>\
price; (S, K, TA;) gave largely for it until I<br>\
obtained it: (TA:) accord. to ISk, I paid in<br>\
advance for the commodity; syn. أَسْلَفْتُ; (S,<br>\
TA;) and in the T it is said, [and in like manner<br>\
in the JK,] that ارهن فِى كَذَا وَ كَذَا signifies<br>\
اسلف فِيهِ: (TA:) [in the K it is said that أَرْهَنَهُ<br>\
signifies أَسْلَفَهُ, as though it meant he lent him a<br>\
sum of money &amp;c.:] accord. to Er-Rághib, the<br>\
proper meaning [of إِرْهَانٌ] is one&#39;s giving a com<br>\
modity before [the full payment of] the price,<br>\
and so making it to be pledged for the completion<br>\
of its price. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  ارهنهُ also signifies He, or<br>\
it, weakened him: (K:) [like أَوْهَنَهُ:] and rendered<br>\
him lean, or emaciated. (TA.) And ارهن اللّٰهُ<br>\
قُوَّتَهُ God weakened him; syn. أَوْهَنَهُ. (JK.)<br>\
6<br>\
تراهنا They two laid bets, wagers, or stakes,<br>\
each with the other; syn. تَوَاضَعَا الرُّهُونَ. (TA.)<br>\
And تراهن القَوْمُ The party contended together,<br>\
every one of them laying a bet, wager, or stake,<br>\
in order that the person outstripping should take<br>\
the whole when he overcame. (Msb.)<br>\
8<br>\
ارتهن مِنْهُ He took, or received, from him a<br>\
pledge. (K.) [Or] ارتهنهُ He took, or received, it<br>\
as a pledge: (JK, Mgh:) or ارتهنهُ مِنْهُ he took,<br>\
or received, it from him; namely, a pledge.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Accord. to Freytag, ارتهنهُ بِهِ signifies<br>\
He had him, or held him, as a pledge to him for<br>\
it. And اُرْتُهِنَ He, or it, was given as a pledge.<br>\
But for neither of these has he mentioned any<br>\
authority.]<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَرْهَنَ [استرهنهُ He asked him, or desired him, to<br>\
pledge a thing with him: and, to give a pledge.]<br>\
You say, اِسْتَرْهَنَنِى كَذَا فَرَهَنْتُهُ عِنْدَهُ [He asked<br>\
me, or desired me, to pledge such a thing, or to<br>\
deposit such a thing as a pledge, and I pledged it<br>\
with him, or deposited it with him as a pledge].<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
رَهْنٌ, originally an inf. n., (Msb,) is syn. with<br>\
↓ مَرْهُونٌ; (Mgh, Msb;) i. e. (Msb) it signifies<br>\
[A pledge;] a thing deposited with a person<br>\
(Msb, * K) to be in lieu of a thing that has been<br>\
taken, or received, from him; (K;) or a thing<br>\
that is deposited as a security for a debt: and<br>\
↓ رِهَانٌ has a similar meaning, but is specially<br>\
applied to a thing that is deposited as a bet, or<br>\
wager, or stake; and is likewise originally an<br>\
inf. n.: (Er-Rághib, TA:) ↓ رَهِينَةٌ, also, is syn.<br>\
with رَهْنٌ [as meaning the act of giving as a<br>\
pledge], like as شَتِيمَةٌ is syn. with شَتْمٌ; the ة<br>\
being added to give intensiveness to the significa<br>\
tion: then, like رَهْنٌ, it is used as syn. with مَرْهُونٌ<br>\
[in the sense explained above, as will be seen in<br>\
what follows in this paragraph]; (IAth, TA;)<br>\
[i. e.] رَهِينَةٌ is an inf. n. like شَتِيمَةٌ, applied to<br>\
denote the pass. part. n. [used as a subst. pro<br>\
perly so termed] like رَهْنٌ, not as an epithet;<br>\
(Bd in lxxiv. 41;) [or, in other words,] رَهِينَةٌ<br>\
signifies anything by reason of which a thing<br>\
[such as a debt or the like] is restricted, or appro<br>\
priated, to oneself; as also ↓ مُرْتَهَنَةٌ: (K: [I here<br>\
follow two copies of the K, in which it is said,<br>\
كُلُّ مَا احْتُبِسَ بِهِ شَىْءٌ فَرَهِينَةٌ وَ مُرْتَهَنَةٌ: in the CK,<br>\
and in the copy of the K followed in the TA,<br>\
فَرَهِينُهُ وَ مُرْتَهَنُهُ, which perverts the meaning, though<br>\
↓ رَهِينٌ and ↓ مُرْتَهَنٌ may be used in the same sense<br>\
as رَهِينَةٌ and مُزْتَهَنَةٌ, as will be seen in the course<br>\
of this paragraph: and in the TA, in the place of<br>\
احْتُبِسَ, is put يحبس, meaning يُحْبَسُ: there is,<br>\
however, this difference between ↓ رَهِينَةٌ and<br>\
↓ مُرْتَهَنَةٌ; that the former properly signifies a thing<br>\
deposited as a pledge; and the latter, a thing<br>\
taken, or received, as a pledge:]) the pl. of رَهْنٌ<br>\
is رِهَانٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and رُهُونٌ (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K) and رُهُنٌ, (Mgh, K,) this last said to be a pl.<br>\
of رَهْنٌ by Aboo-&#39; Amr Ibn-El-&#39; Alà, but disap<br>\
proved by Akh, because a word of the measure<br>\
فَعْلٌ has not a pl. of the measure فُعُلٌ except in<br>\
rare and anomalous instances, though he says that<br>\
it may be [as it is said to be in the Msb] pl. of<br>\
رِهَانٌ, which is pl. of رَهْنٌ, (S,) and Fr says that<br>\
رُهُنٌ is pl. of رِهَانٌ, but this is denied in the M,<br>\
because any pl. may not be pluralized except<br>\
when there is express authority for it and when<br>\
the case does not admit of any other decision;<br>\
(TA;) and رُهْنٌ, also, is another pl. of رَهْنٌ, (TA,)<br>\
[or rather it is a contraction of رُهُنٌ;] and<br>\
another pl. of رَهْنٌ [or rather a quasi-pl. n.] is<br>\
↓ رَهِينٌ, (IJ, K,) like as عَبِيدٌ is of عَبْدٌ: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. of ↓ رَهِينَةٌ is رَهَائِنُ. (S, K.) غَلِقَ الرَّهْنُ<br>\
بِمَا فِيهِ. [The pledge became, or has become, per<br>\
manent as a possession, with what was, or is,<br>\
comprised in it,] is a prov., applied to him who<br>\
has fallen into a case from which he cannot hope<br>\
to escape: it is said in a trad., لَا يَغْلَقُِ الرَّهْنُ,<br>\
(Meyd,) [i. e. The pledge shall not remain, or let<br>\
not the pledge remain, in the hand of its receiver<br>\
when its depositer is able to release it; for] لا<br>\
is here either negative or prohibitive: you say,<br>\
غَلِقَ الرَّهْنُ, aor. يَغْلَقُ, inf. n. غُلُوقٌ [or غَلَقٌ],<br>\
meaning The pledge remained in the hand of the<br>\
receiver when the depositor was able to release it:<br>\
(Nh, cited in a copy of the “ Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer: ”)<br>\
the trad. means that the receiver of the pledge<br>\
shall not have a right to it when the depositer has<br>\
not released it within a certain time: for it was a<br>\
custom in the Time of Ignorance for the receiver<br>\
to keep possession of the pledge in this case;<br>\
but El-Islám abolished it. (Meyd, * Nh.) You<br>\
say also, هُوَ رَهْنٌ بِكَذَا and بكذا ↓ رَهِينَةٌ He, or it,<br>\
is [a person, or thing,] pledged for such a thing:<br>\
(IAth, TA:) or taken [as a pledge] for such a<br>\
thing; as also ↓ رَهِينٌ and ↓ مُرْتَهَنٌ. (TA.) And<br>\
أَنَا رَهْنٌ بِكَذَا and ↓ رَهِينٌ and ↓ رَهِينَةٌ I am taken<br>\
[as a pledge] for such a thing. (Mgh.) And<br>\
[hence,] أَنَا لَكَ رَهْنٌ بِكَذَا (JK, TA) and ↓ رَهِينَةٌ<br>\
(TA) I am responsible, or a surety, to thee for<br>\
such a thing. (JK, TA.) And بِقَيْدِهِ ↓ رِجْلُهُ رَهِينَةٌ<br>\
[His leg, or foot, is a pledge for the safe-keeping<br>\
of his shackle: for if the meaning were مَرْهُونَةٌ it<br>\
would be رَهِينٌ, without ة]. (TA.) And الخَلْقُ<br>\
المَوْتِ ↓ رَهَائِنُ [Mankind, or all created beings,<br>\
are the pledges of death]. (TA.) And هُوَ رَهْنُ<br>\
يَدِ المَنِيَّةِ [He is the pledge of the hand of death,<br>\
or of fate, or destiny]; said of one when he has<br>\
sought, or courted, death. (TA.) And يَدِى لَكَ<br>\
رَهْنٌ [My hand is a pledge to thee]; by which is<br>\
meant responsibility, or suretiship. (TA.) And<br>\
قَبْرٍ ↓ إِنَّهُ لَرَهِينُ [Verily he is the pledge of a<br>\
grave, which will render him up on the day of<br>\
resurrection]. (TA.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
lxxiv. 41, ↓ كُلُّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ رَهِينَةٌ, meaning<br>\
[Every soul is a thing] pledged with God [for what<br>\
it shall have wrought; its works being regarded as<br>\
a debt, for which it will be either released or held in<br>\
custody to be punished everlastingly]: رهينة being<br>\
an inf. n. like شَتِيمَةٌ applied to denote the pass.<br>\
part. n. [in a manner before mentioned] like رَهْنٌ;<br>\
for if it were an epithet [i. e. used in the proper<br>\
sense of a pass. part. n.] the word would be<br>\
رَهِينٌ. (Bd.) And in lii. 21 of the same, كُلُّ<br>\
↓ امْرِئٍ بِمَا كَسَبَ رَهِينٌ, i. e. [Every man is]<br>\
pledged (مَرْهُونٌ, Bd, Jel) with God (عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ)<br>\
for what he shall have wrought; so that if he<br>\
have done good, He will release him; but other<br>\
wise, He will destroy [or hold in confinement<br>\
and punish] him; (Bd;) or to be punished for<br>\
evil, and recompensed for good. (Jel.) And it<br>\
is said in a trad., بِعَقِيقَتِهِ ↓ كُلُّ غُلَامٍ رَهِينَةٌ [Every<br>\
boy that is born is a pledge for his عقيقة, i. e.<br>\
for the victim that is to be sacrificed for him when<br>\
his head is shaven the first time; which is com<br>\
monly regarded as his ransom from the fire of<br>\
Hell]: i. e., the عقيقة is absolutely necessary for<br>\
him; wherefore he is likened, when not released<br>\
from it, to a pledge in the hand of the receiver:<br>\
El-Khattábee says that the best explanation of it<br>\
is that of Ahmad Ibn-Hambal; that if the عقيقة<br>\
be not sacrificed for the boy and he die an infant,<br>\
he will not intercede for his parents. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also what next follows.<br>\
هُوَ رِهْنُ مَالٍ, (JK, K, TA,) with kesr, (K,)<br>\
and ↓ رَهْنُهُ, (JK,) He is a manager, tender, or<br>\
superintendent, of cattle, or camels &amp;c.; or a good<br>\
pastor thereof. (K, * TA.)<br>\
رِهَانٌ, as a sing: see رَهْنٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also a pl. of<br>\
the latter word. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.)<br>\
رَهِينٌ: see مَرْهُونٌ: and see also رَهْنٌ in six<br>\
places.<br>\
رَهِينَةٌ, and its pl. رَهَائِنُ: see رَهْنٌ, in ten places.<br>\
رَاهِنٌ Continuing, subsisting, lasting, enduring,<br>\
remaining, or remaining fixed or stationary,<br>\
permanent, constant, firm, steady, steadfast,<br>\
stable, fixed, fast, settled, or established. (S, *<br>\
Mgh, Msb.) You say طَعَامٌ رَاهِنٌ (S, Mgh) Food<br>\
that continues, or is permanent, &amp;c. (Mgh.)<br>\
And خَمْرٌ رَاهِنَةٌ Wine of which there is a con<br>\
tinual, or constant, supply; uninterrupted, or<br>\
unfailing. (TA.) And نِعْمَةُ اللّٰهِ رَاهِنَةٌ, i. e. [The<br>\
bounty of God is] continual, permanent, or<br>\
constant. (TA.) And حَالَةٌ رَاهِنَةٌ A state, or<br>\
condition, continuing; remaining to the present<br>\
time. (Es-Semeen, TA.) And هٰذَا رَاهِنٌ لَكَ<br>\

beloved by thee; and also as explained below.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  Remaining, staying, dwelling, or abid<br>\
ing, in a place. (JK.) ―<br>\

and also This is prepared for thee. (TA.) ―<br>\

As an epithet applied to a man, and a camel,<br>\
(JK, S, TA,) and any beast, (TA,) Lean, or<br>\
emaciated; (JK, S, K, TA;) accord. to ISh, in<br>\
consequence of riding, or disease, or some [other]<br>\
accident: (TA:) and fatigued, tired, weary, or<br>\
jaded. (JK, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And إِبِلٌ رَاهِنَةٌ Camels that<br>\
will not, or do not, pasture upon the [plants, or<br>\
tress, termed] حَمْض. (JK.)<br>\
رَاهِنَةٌ The navel, with what surrounds it, (JK,<br>\

أُرْهُونٌ A girl, or young woman menstruating:<br>\
(K:) seen by Az in the handwriting of Aboo<br>\

مَرْهُونٌ [Pledged; deposited as a pledge; or]<br>\
restricted, or placed in custody, for, or by reason<br>\
of, a debt; (S, * Msb;) originally مَرْهُونٌ بِالدَّيْنِ<br>\
[or بِدَيْنٍ]; (Msb;) and ↓ رَهِينٌ signifies the same;<br>\
(S, Msb;) and the fem. of this [or rather the<br>\
subst. formed from it, for when it is used as a<br>\
fem. epithet, having the sense of a pass. part. n.,<br>\
it is without ة, as remarked above, voce رَهْنٌ,] is<br>\
رَهِينَةٌ. (S.) الأُمُورُ مَرْهُونَةٌ بِأَوْقَاتِهَا is expl. by مَكْفُولَةٌ<br>\
