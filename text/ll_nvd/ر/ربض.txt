رَبَضَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
رَبِضَ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. رُبُوضٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and رَبْضٌ<br>\
(Msb, K) and رَبْضَةٌ, (K,) [the last an inf. n. of<br>\
un.,] said of the sheep and goat, (S, A, Mgh, K,)<br>\
and of the gazelle, (S, A,) and of the ox-kind,<br>\
and the horse, (S,) or beast, (Msb,) and of the<br>\
dog, (S, A,) [signifying He lay down, or laid<br>\
himself down, upon his breast,] is like بَرَكَ said of<br>\
a camel, (S, Msb, K,) and جَثَمَ said of a bird, (S,<br>\
TA,) or جَلَسَ said of a man. (Mgh.) Said of a<br>\
man, it means [(assumed tropical:)  He lay down: and he sat: or]<br>\
he sat upon his knees: and it may also mean he<br>\
sat upon his thighs and his buttocks. (Har p. 172.)<br>\
[And hence, (assumed tropical:)  He remained fixed, or stationary,<br>\
like an animal lying upon its breast; as is shown<br>\
by what here follows: whence a signification of<br>\
رَبَّضَ, q. v.] The saying of Mohammad to Ed-<br>\
Dahhák, when he sent him to his people, إِذَا<br>\
أَتَيْتَهُمْ فَارْبِضْ فِى دَارِهِمْ ظَبْيًا, means When thou<br>\
comest to them, remain in their abode in security,<br>\
or without fear, like the gazelle in his covert:<br>\
(IAar, ISd, K:) or trust them not, but be vigilant, like a wild animal, ready to spring up, for<br>\
thou wilt be in the midst of the unbelievers;<br>\
(Az, ISd, K; *) so, if anything induce in thee<br>\
suspicion, thou mayest flee from them like the<br>\
gazelle: (Az, ISd, TA:) accord. to each interpretation, ظبيا is in the accus. case as a denotative of<br>\
state; the subst. being put in the place of the act.<br>\
part. n., as though for مَتَظَبِّيًا: the former of the<br>\
two explanations is said to be the more agreeable<br>\
with the circumstances of the case. (TA.) You<br>\
say also, رَبَضَ الأَسَدُ عَلَى فَرِيسَتِهِ, and القِرْنُ عَلَى<br>\
قِرْنِهِ, The lion laid himself down upon his breast<br>\
(بَرَكَ) on his prey, and the adversary on his<br>\
adversary. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He (a beast) lodged, and<br>\
abode, in a place. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  He (a man) became heavy, and slept, stretched upon the ground.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  رَبَضَ عَنِ الغَنَمِ, (S, A, K,) inf. n. رُبُوضٌ,<br>\
(S,) (tropical:)  He (a ram) abstained from tupping, or<br>\
covering the ewes, and avoided it, (S, A, * K, *) or<br>\
them, (TA,) being fatigued: (S:) or was unable<br>\
to cover them: (K:) one does not say, of a ram,<br>\
جَفَرَ. (S.) You say also of a ewe when she is<br>\
pregnant, قَدْ رُبِضَ عَنْهَا. (Ibn- &#39;Abbád, A.) And<br>\
you say of a man, رَبَضَ عَنْ مَعَالِى الأُمُورِ (assumed tropical:)  He abstained, or held back, from seeking the means of<br>\
acquiring eminence, or nobility. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  رَبَضَ<br>\
اللَّيْلُ (A, K) (tropical:)  The night cast its darkness [lit.<br>\
itself (expl. by أَلْقَى بنَفْسِهِ) upon the earth]. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  رَبَضَهُ, aor.<br>\
رَبِضَ and<br>\
رَبُضَ, (IAar, O, K,) but the<br>\
latter aor. was afterwards rejected by IAar, (TA,)<br>\
He betook himself, or repaired, to him for<br>\
lodging, covert, or refuge. (IAar, O, K.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
رَبَضَتْهُ, aor.<br>\
رَبِضَ, and IAar is related to have said<br>\
رَبُضَ<br>\
also, but afterwards to have retracted it, (tropical:)  She (a<br>\
wife, or sister, or other woman,) undertook, or<br>\
managed, his affairs, and gave him lodging, or<br>\
refuge: (TA:) she was to him [as though she<br>\
were] a رَبَض, or place of abode: like أَبَوْتُهُ “ I<br>\
was to him a father,” and أَمَمْتُهُ “ I was to him<br>\
a mother. ” (A, TA.) [The aor. occurs in the<br>\
K, in the phrase تَرْبِضُ زَوْجَهَا: thus in the TA:<br>\
in the CK, تُرَبِّضُ: in the L, تَرْبُضُ; and thus also<br>\
the aor. is written in a copy of the A.]<br>\
2<br>\
رَبَّضَ see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  رَبَّضْتُهُ بِالمَكَانِ, inf. n. تَرْبِيضٌ, (assumed tropical:)  I<br>\
fixed him, or made him to remain fixed, in the<br>\
place. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ربّض السِّقَآءَ بِالمَآءِ, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
as above, (K, TA,) [He made the skin to cleave<br>\
to the ground with water; i. e.] he put into the<br>\
skin as much water as covered and concealed its<br>\
bottom: (K, * TA:) mentioned by Sgh, from<br>\
Ibn- &#39;Abbád. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اربض He made a sheep, or goat, [&amp;c., (see<br>\
1,)] to lie down upon his breast; (S, K;) as also<br>\
↓ ربّض, inf. n. تَرْبِيضٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَرْبَضَهُمْ (tropical:)  It (a<br>\
vessel, S, A, K, and beverage, or wine, A, TA)<br>\
satisfied their thirst so that they became heavy,<br>\
and slept, stretched upon the ground: (S, * A, *<br>\
K:) (tropical:)  it (milk) satiated them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اربضت<br>\
الشَّمْسُ (tropical:)  The sun became vehemently hot, (S, A,<br>\
K,) so as to make the gazelle and the sheep or<br>\
goat, (S,) or the wild animals, (A,) to lie down<br>\
upon their breasts: (S, A:) or became still, like<br>\
a beast lying upon its breast, having attained its<br>\
utmost height and not begun to descend. (O.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
اربض أَهْلَهُ, (O, K,) and أَصْحَابَهُ, (O,) (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
undertook, or managed, the expenses of his<br>\
family, (O, K,) and of his companions; (O;)<br>\
syn. قَامَ بنَفَقَتِهِمْ: (O, K:) so says Ibn- &#39;Abbád.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رَبْضٌ: see رَبَضٌ.<br>\
رُبْضٌ: see رَبَضٌ, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, accord. to Ks, (S,) and As, (Sgh, TA,) The middle<br>\
of a thing: (S, Sgh, K:) but this is disapproved<br>\
by Sh. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A collection of trees of the<br>\
kinds called طَلْح and سَمُر: (K:) or a collection<br>\
of abundant and dense trees. (TA.)<br>\
رِبْضٌ: see رَبِيضٌ: in three places.<br>\
رَبَضٌ The lodging-place of sheep or goats;<br>\
(S, A, * K;) because they lie therein upon their<br>\
breasts; and in like manner of wild animals:<br>\
(TA:) the nightly lodging-place of sheep or<br>\
goats: (Msb:) and ↓ مَرْبِضٌ signifies the same:<br>\
(S, * A, Mgh, Msb:) pl. of the former أَرْبَاضٌ: (S,<br>\
A, * TA:) and of the latter مَرَابِضُ: (S, K: *) the<br>\
مرابض of sheep or goats are like the مَعَاطِن of<br>\
camels. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  A place of abode: a place of<br>\
abode of a people by itself: (A, TA:) pl. as<br>\
above. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  Anything to which a man<br>\
betakes himself, or repairs, for lodging, covert,<br>\
or refuge, (ISk, S, A, * Msb, K,) and at which,<br>\
or with which, he finds rest, or ease; (K;) such<br>\
as a house or tent, (S, A, K,) and the like, (S, K,)<br>\
and a wife, (ISk, S, A, Msb,) or relations, (ISk,<br>\
A, Msb,) or a family, and a relation, and<br>\
property, (K,) and sheep or goats, and means of<br>\
subsistence, and food; (TA;) and hence, (S,)<br>\
milk which sustains a man, and suffices him for<br>\
food: (S, K: *) pl. as above: (K:) رَبَضٌ and<br>\
↓ رَبْضٌ and ↓ رُبْضٌ (IAar, Sgh, K) and ↓ رُبُضٌ<br>\
(K) are applied to a wife لِأَنَّهَا تَرْبِضُ زَوْجَهَا, (so<br>\
in copies of the K and in the TA, but in the CK<br>\
تُرَبِّضُ,) i. e. because she undertakes, or manages,<br>\
the affairs of her husband, and gives him lodging,<br>\
or refuge; (TA;) or because she fixes him,<br>\
(تُرَبِّضُهُ, i. e. تُثَبِّتُهُ,) so that he does not quit his<br>\
place: (L, TA:) or to the mother; or the sister;<br>\
who undertakes, or manages, the affairs of (تُعَزِّبُ<br>\
[so in copies of the K and in the TA, in the<br>\
latter of which it is thus explained, but in the CK<br>\
تُقَرِّبُ,]) her relation. (K.) A poet says,<br>\
جَآءَ الشِّتَآءُ وَلَمَّا أَتَّخِذْ رَبَضًا<br>\
يَا وَيْحَ كَفَّىَّ مِنْ حَفْرِ القَرَامِيصِ<br>\
(S, Mgh) i. e. [The winter has come, and I have<br>\
not yet made for myself] a lodging: [O, wo to<br>\
my two-hands, in consequence of digging] hollows<br>\
in which to sit for protection from the cold.<br>\
(Mgh.) And from رَبَضٌ applied to “ milk which<br>\
sustains a man, and suffices him for food,” originated the prov., (K, TA,) مِنْكَ رَبَضُكَ وَإِنْ كَانَ<br>\
سَمَارًا, meaning (tropical:)  Thy family and thy servants<br>\
(S, K) and those to whom thou betakest thyself<br>\
for lodging or refuge, (S,) are appertenances of<br>\
thine, though they be persons falling short [of<br>\
their duty]: (S, K:) or thy manager of affairs,<br>\
&amp;c., though he be not a good manager of thine<br>\
affairs: (L, TA:) and رَبَضٌ also signifies any<br>\
woman who undertakes, or manages, the affairs<br>\
of a house: but in the T we find ↓ رُبْضُكَ, thus<br>\
written, as by Th, on the authority of IAar, but<br>\
not restricted by a measure, and explained as<br>\
meaning the person who undertakes, or manages,<br>\
the affairs of thy house; and so in the book of<br>\
proverbs by As: and in the margin of a copy of<br>\
the S, we find the above-cited prov. thus written,<br>\
وَإِنْ كَانَ سَمَارًا ↓ مِنْكَ رُبُضُكَ, as from the “ Book<br>\
on Goats ” by Ibn-Zeyd, and expl. as meaning<br>\
the sons of thy father are appertenances of thine,<br>\
though they be evil persons, in whom is no good.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (tropical:)  The wall of a city: (K, TA:) the<br>\
environs of a city, (S, A, Mgh,) and of a قَصْر [or<br>\
palace &amp;c.], (A,) consisting of houses or dwellings,<br>\
(A, Mgh,) or of open country: (TA:) and ↓ رُبْضٌ<br>\
signifies the same: (TA:) or this latter signifies<br>\
the foundation, or basis, of a building; and of a<br>\
city also: (K:) IKh writes it ↓ رُبُضٌ: and some<br>\
say that ↓ رُبْضٌ and رَبَضٌ signify the same: (TA:)<br>\
the former of these two signifies also the part, of<br>\
a thing, that touches the ground: (K, TA:) so says<br>\
Sh: accord. to ISh, الأَرْضِ ↓ رُبْضُ signifies what<br>\
touches the ground, of a thing: (TA:) and رَبَضٌ<br>\
also signifies a lateral, or an outward or adjacent,<br>\
part: (K:) or lateral, or outward or adjacent,<br>\
parts of a thing: (Ks, S:) also the space immediately pertaining to a mosque: and [the pl.]<br>\
أَرْبَاضٌ is explained by El-Karkhee as applied to<br>\
the quarters, or districts, of a town, or city.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b5-  رَبَضٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The rope of the<br>\
[camel&#39;s saddle called] رَحْل, (A, K,) with which<br>\
the رحل is bound; (A, TA;) one of the أَرْبَاض,<br>\
or ropes of the رَحْل: (S, A:) or the part that is<br>\
next the ground thereof; (K;) i. e., of the rope<br>\
of the رحل; (TA;) not what is above the رحل:<br>\
(K:) accord. to Lth, the part [of the belly] of<br>\
the camel that is next the ground when he lies<br>\
down; (L, TA; *) and the belly of the she-camel;<br>\
and in like manner IAar explains the pl. أَرْبَاضٌ<br>\
as meaning the bellies of camels; but Az says that<br>\
this is a mistake. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  A girth of a<br>\
رَحْل, like the نِطَاق [q. v.], which is put upon the<br>\
flanks of the she-camel, so as to have the haunches<br>\
behind it, (K, TA,) on either side, having at its<br>\
two ends two rings, to which are tied the [woven,<br>\
or plaited, thongs called] أَنْسَاع: the رحل is bound<br>\
with it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also (tropical:)  The مَصَارِين [or guts,<br>\
or intestines,] of the belly, that have a winding,<br>\
or coiled, form; (Lth, A, TA;) such as are in<br>\
the belly of a sheep or goat: (Lth, TA:) or the<br>\
folding intestines of beasts: (AHat, TA:) or the<br>\
guts, bowels, or intestines, into which the food<br>\
passes from the stomach; syn. أَمْعَآءٌ: (S, K:)<br>\
or the contents of the belly, (K, TA,) consisting<br>\
of the مَصَارِين &amp;c., (TA,) except the heart (K,<br>\
TA) and the lungs. (TA.) (assumed tropical:)  The part that<br>\
comprises the حَوَايَا [or winding, circling, or<br>\
coiled, guts or intestines]; (IAar, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ رَبِيضٌ and ↓ مَرْبِضٌ and ↓ مَرْبَضٌ: (IAar, K,<br>\
TA:) some describe the رَبَض as below the navel;<br>\
and the ↓ مَرْبَض, as beneath the navel and above<br>\
the pubes. (TA.)<br>\
رُبُضٌ [(tropical:)  Holding back, through indolence].<br>\
رُبُضٌ عَنِ الحَاجَاتِ, (A, K,) in [some of] the<br>\
copies of the K, erroneously, عَلَى الحاجات,<br>\
(TA,) and الأَسْفَارِ, (A, TA,) means (tropical:)  A man who<br>\
does not rise to perform needful affairs, (A, K,)<br>\
and journeys: (A, TA:) or who does not go forth<br>\
to undertake them. (Lh, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also رَبَضٌ,<br>\
in three places.<br>\
رُبْضَةٌ, applied to a man, i q. ↓ مُتَرَبِّضٌ; (K;)<br>\
i. e. (tropical:)  Remaining stationary, and impotent; (TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ رُبَضَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also رِبْضَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A portion, (K,) or large portion, (IDrd,) of<br>\
ثَرِيد [i. e. crumbled bread moistened with broth].<br>\
(IDrd, K.)<br>\
-A3-  See also رُبْصَةٌ, with the unpointed ص.<br>\
رِبْضَةٌ A mode, or manner, of lying upon the<br>\
breast: (K, and Har p. 382: [see 1, first signification:]) this is the primary meaning. (Har.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And A place thereof. (Har ibid. [See again<br>\
رَبَضٌ, first signification.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also رَبِيضٌ, in<br>\
three places. ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A place of slaughter<br>\
(مَقْتَل) of any party, or company of men, slain<br>\
in one plot of ground: (Lth, Sgh, K:) erroneously<br>\
written by Sgh in the TS رَبَضَة; but in the O<br>\
correctly. (TA.) [And accord. to the TA, it<br>\
seems to be also applied to (assumed tropical:)  The party so slain.]<br>\
-A2-  Also The body [of an animal] when lying<br>\
upon the breast; particularly, of a hare, (A, K,)<br>\
and of a lamb, (A, TA,) and of a she-goat;<br>\
and so ↓ رُبْضَةٌ. (TA.) Hence the saying, أَتَانَا<br>\
بِثَرِيدٍ كَأَنَّهُ رِبْضَةُ أَرْنَبٍ [He brought us crumbled<br>\
bread moistened with broth resembling in size and<br>\
shape the body of a hare lying upon its breast].<br>\
(A, K. *)<br>\
دَابَّةٌ ضَخْمَةُ الرَّبَضَةِ A beast of which the traces<br>\
of the place where it has been tied [and app.<br>\
where it has lain] are large, or wide. (TA.)<br>\
رُبَضَةٌ: see رُبْضَةٌ.<br>\

-b2-  Applied to a [skin such<br>\
as is termed] قِرْبَة, (tropical:)  Great, or large; hardly, or<br>\
not at all, to be lifted; so that it remains fixed;<br>\
or so that it causes him who desires to lift it to<br>\

to a tree (شَجَرَة), meaning (tropical:)  Great, or large,<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S, A, * K,) and thick, (S,) and, accord.<br>\
to the K, wide, but [SM says,] I have not seen<br>\
that any of the leading authorities applies it in<br>\
this last sense to a tree: (TA:) pl. رُبَضٌ. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Applied to a chain (سِلْسِلَة), (tropical:)  Large, or big,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) and heavy, cleaving to him upon<br>\

-b5-  Applied to a coat<br>\
of mail (دِرْع), (tropical:)  Large, or big: (A, TA:) or<br>\

رَبِيضٌ Sheep, or goats, with their pastors, collected together in their lodging-places; (S, A,<br>\
K;) as though it were a quasi-pl. n.; as also<br>\
↓ رِبْضَةٌ and ↓ رِبْضٌ: (TA:) and hence, (L, TA,)<br>\
↓ the former of these two, (assumed tropical:)  a company of men:<br>\
(L, K:) and ↓ the latter of them, [accord. to the<br>\
K,] a herd of bulls, or cows, in their lodgingplace; from the author of the book entitled<br>\
كِتَابُ المُزْدَوِجِ مِنَ اللُّغَاتِ, only: (K, * TA:) but<br>\
what this author says is, that ↓ رِبْضٌ signifies the<br>\
lodging-places of bulls or cows [app. with the<br>\
beasts in them]: and that the primary application of this word (رِبْضٌ) and ↓ رِبْضَةٌ is to sheep or<br>\
goats; and that by a subsequent usage they have<br>\
been applied to bulls or cows and to men. (TA.)<br>\
See also رَابِضٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, صَبَّ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
حُمَّى رَبِيضًا [app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  May God send (lit.<br>\
pour) upon him a fever that shall cleave to him<br>\
like as an animal lying upon its breast cleaves<br>\

-A2-  See also رَبَضٌ, last<br>\
sentence.<br>\
رَبَّاضٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
رَابِضٌ Lying upon his breast; applied to a<br>\
sheep or goat [&amp;c.]; and so ↓ رَبُوضٌ applied to a<br>\
hare; so too ↓ رَبَّاضٌ [but app. in an intensive or<br>\
a frequentative sense] applied to a lion, as is also<br>\
رَابِضٌ, and to a man lying on his adversary:<br>\
(TA:) and [hence] ↓ الرَّبَّاضُ is an appellation of<br>\
the lion: (K:) the pl. [of رَابِضٌ] is رُبَّضٌ and<br>\
رُبُوضٌ: and the phrase الغَنَمِ ↓ كَرَبِيضَةِ, occurring in a trad., means كَالغَنَمِ الرُّبَّضِ [Like the<br>\
sheep, or goats, that are lying upon their breasts].<br>\
(TA.) It is said in a prov., كَلْبٌ جَوَّالٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ<br>\
أَسَدٍ رَابِضٍ or رَبَضَ [A dog that roams about is<br>\
better than a lion lying upon his breast or that<br>\
has laid himself down upon his breast]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence, because of his cleaving to the ground,]<br>\
(tropical:)  A sick man. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also the phrase,]<br>\
أَرْنَبَتُهُ رَابِضَةٌ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ (tropical:)  The end of his nose is<br>\
flat, and spreading upon his face. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
الرَّابِضَانِ is an appellation applied to The Turks<br>\
and the Abyssinians. (K, TA.) These are meant<br>\
in the trad. of Mo&#39;áwiyeh, لَا تَبْعَثُوا الرَّابِضَيْنِ,<br>\
i. e. Rouse not ye against you the two [peoples]<br>\
that are remaining quiet as long as they do not<br>\
pursue you: it is like another trad., in which it<br>\
is said, اُتْرُكُوا التُّرْكَ مَا تَرَكُوكُمْ وَدَعُوا الحَبَشَةَ مَا<br>\
وَدَعُوكُمْ [Leave ye alone the Turks as long as<br>\
they leave you alone, and let ye alone the Abyssinians as long as they let you alone]. (TA.)<br>\
رَابِضَةٌ [as a subst. from رَابِضٌ, made so by the<br>\
affix ة, An animal lying upon its breast]. One<br>\
says of a man who kills when he shoots, and<br>\
more commonly of him who kills when he smites<br>\
with the [evil] eye, فُلَانٌ مَا تَقُومُ رَابِضَتُهُ [Such a<br>\
one is so effective in his aim that his animal lying<br>\
upon its breast does not rise]: (ISk, S, TA:) and<br>\
in like manner, مَا تَقُومُ لَهُ رَابِضَةٌ: it is a prov.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in a trad., فَانْبَعَثَ لَهُ وَاحِدٌ مِنَ<br>\
الرَّابِضَةِ [And there rose and went to him one of<br>\
the رَابضة]: (Lth, A, TA:) الرَّابِضَةُ means (tropical:)  certain<br>\
angels who were sent down [from Paradise] with<br>\
Adam, (Lth, A, K, TA,) who direct those that<br>\
err from the right way: (Lth, A, TA:) perhaps<br>\
(Lth, TA) so called from their remaining upon<br>\
the earth: (Lth, * A, TA: *) and [so in the K, but<br>\
correctly “ or,”] the remainder of the Bearers of<br>\
Evidence (حَمَلَةِ الحُجَّةِ [meaning those angels<br>\
whereof every individual of mankind has two<br>\
appointed to attend him constantly for the purpose of their bearing evidence of his good and<br>\
evil deeds, which two are termed in the Kur l. 16<br>\
المُتَلَقِّيَانِ,]) whereof the earth will never be destitute. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And in another trad., respecting<br>\
the signs of the coming of the resurrection, the<br>\
Prophet is related to have said that one of those<br>\
signs will be, that the ↓ رُوَيْبِضَة will speak respecting the affairs of the community: (T, TA:)<br>\
الرُّوَيْبِضَةُ is the dim. of الرَّابِضَةُ (T, K, TA) signifying The pastor of رَبِيض [q. v.]; (T, TA;) and<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  the mean, contemptible man, (S, K,) who<br>\
speaks respecting the affairs of the community:<br>\
thus expl. by the Prophet himself: (K: [in the<br>\
CK, النّاقِهُ is erroneously put for التَّافِهُ:]) or he<br>\
explained it as meaning (assumed tropical:)  the vitious, or wicked,<br>\
who speaks respecting the affairs of the community: A &#39;Obeyd compares this trad. with<br>\
another, in which it is said that one of the signs<br>\
above mentioned will be, that the pastors of<br>\

and Az says that الرويبضة means the pastor of<br>\
sheep or goats: some say that it means (assumed tropical:)  he who<br>\
abstains, or holds back, from seeking the means<br>\
of acquiring eminence, or nobility; and الرَّابِضَةُ<br>\
signifies [the same, or] impotent to attain eminence: in this latter, the ة is added to give<br>\
intensiveness to the signification: and Az thinks<br>\
it most probable that each of these is applied to<br>\
the mean man because of his remaining in his<br>\
house, or tent, and seldom rising and going forth<br>\
to occupy himself in great affairs. (TA.)<br>\
