رَتَلَ, inf. n. رَتَلٌ, The front teeth<br>\

[or separate, one from another, and even in the<br>\

تَرْتِيلٌ, in its original sense, relates to the<br>\
teeth; signifying تَفْلِيج thereof [i. e., as inf. n. of<br>\
the verb in its pass. form, Their being separate,<br>\
one from another]. (Bd in xxv. 34.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
رتّل الكَلَامَ, (T, M, K,) inf. n. تَرْتِيلٌ, (K,) He<br>\
put together and arranged well the component parts of the speech, or saying, (M, K,)<br>\
and made it distinct: and hence تَرْتِيلُ القُرْآنِ<br>\
[explained in what follows]: (M:) or he proceeded in a leisurely manner in the speech, or<br>\
saying, [making the utterance distinct,] and put<br>\
together and arranged well its component parts:<br>\
(T:) and رَتَّلْتُ القُرْآنَ inf. n. as above, I read,<br>\
or recited, the Kur-án in a leisurely manner;<br>\
without haste: (Msb:) or التَّرْتِيلُ in reading, or<br>\
reciting, [and particularly in the reading, or reciting, of the Kur-án,] is the proceeding in a<br>\
leisurely manner, and uttering distinctly, without<br>\
exceeding the proper bounds or limits: (S:) [and<br>\
hence, conventionally, the chanting of the Kur-án<br>\
in a peculiar, distinct, and leisurely, manner:]<br>\
and فِى كَلَامِهِ ↓ ترتّل, (T,) or فِى الكَلَامِ, (M, K,)<br>\
signifies [in like manner] he proceeded in a<br>\
leisurely manner (T, M, K) in his speech, or<br>\
saying, (T,) or in the speech, or saying: (M, K:)<br>\
Mujáhid explains التَّرْتِيل as signifying the proceeding in a leisurely manner [in reading, or<br>\
reciting], and as being consecutive in its parts, or<br>\
portions; regarding it as etymologically relating<br>\
to ثَغْرٌ رَتِلٌ [q. v.]: (T:) accord. to Er-Rághib,<br>\
it signifies the pronouncing the word [or words]<br>\
with ease and correctness: this is the proper signification: but the conventional meaning, as verified by El-Munáwee, is the being regardful of<br>\
the places of utterance of the letters, and mindful<br>\
of the pauses, and the lowering of the voice,<br>\
and making it plaintive, in reading, or reciting:<br>\
(TA:) [accord. to Mtr,] the [proper] meaning<br>\
of الترتيل in [the reciting, or chanting, of the<br>\
Kur-án and of] the call to prayer &amp;c. is the<br>\
pronouncing of the letters in a leisurely manner,<br>\
and distinctly, and so giving them their proper<br>\
full sound; from the phrase ثَغْرٌ مُرَتَّلٌ and رَتِلٌ<br>\
signifying “ front teeth separate, one from another,<br>\
and even in the manner of growth, and well set<br>\
together. ” (Mgh.) [See also تَرْسِيلٌ.] وَرَتَّلْنَاهُ<br>\
تَرْتِيلًا, in the Kur [xxv. 34], means And we have<br>\
sent it down unto thee in a leisurely manner:<br>\
(M, TA:) or we have recited it to thee part after<br>\
part, in a deliberate and leisurely manner; in<br>\
[the course of] twenty years, or three and twenty:<br>\
