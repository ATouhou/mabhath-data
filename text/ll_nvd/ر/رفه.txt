[See also ثِلْثٌ, and عُرَيْجَآءُ.] Lebeed uses it metaphorically in relation to palm-trees growing over<br>\
water, saying,<br>\
يَشْرَبْنَ رِفْهًا عِرَاكًا غَيْرَ صَادِيَةٍ<br>\
فَكُلُّهَا كَارِعٌ فِى المَآءِ مُغْتَمِرُ<br>\

been trodden, or thrashed, and cut: by some<br>\

whence the prov., أَغْنَى مِنَ التُّفَهِ عَنِ الرُّفَهِ [More<br>\
free from want than the badger is from the want<br>\
of straw]; التُّفَهُ meaning the beast of prey called<br>\
عَنَاقُ الأَرْضِ; because it does not feed upon straw:<br>\
(S:) [by some written التُّفَّهُ; and by some, التُّفَةُ;<br>\
and by some, التُّفَّةُ:] accord. to some, the former<br>\
word is with ة; and الرُّفَرُفَتٌ occurs as its pl. in a<br>\
verse cited by IF: accord to ISk, the two words<br>\
are correctly without teshdeed, and with the<br>\
radical ه. (TA in art. تفه.) [See also رُفَتٌ, in<br>\
art. رفت.]<br>\
رَفْهَةٌ Pity, compassion, or mercy. (AHeyth,<br>\
K.) Thus expl. as used in the saying, إِذَا سَقَطَتِ<br>\
الطَّرْفَهْ قَلَّتْ فِى الأَرْضِ الرَّفْهَه. (TA. [But الطَّرْفَه<br>\
is here an evident mistranscription for الصَّرْفَه, the<br>\
name of the Twelfth Mansion of the Moon: the<br>\
meaning is, When الصرفه sets aurorally, pity becomes little in the earth; because then the cold<br>\
ends: see art. صرف.])<br>\

quasi-coordinate to the quinqueliteral-radical class<br>\

mentioned also in a separate art., as well as here,<br>\
in the S and K,]) A state of life ample in its<br>\
means or circumstances, unstraitened, or plentiful,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) and easy, pleasant, soft, or delicate:<br>\
