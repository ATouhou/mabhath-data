camel, (K,) or ارتحل رَحْلَهُ, (TA,) signifies He<br>\

resurrection], النَّاسَ ↓ تَخْرُجُ نَارٌ مِنْ عَدَنَ تُرْحِلُ,<br>\
i.e. [A fire shall issue from &#39;Adan] that shall<br>\

النَّاسَ, i.e. that shall make the people to alight at<br>\

that she became such as is termed رَاحِلَة, meaning<br>\
fit to be saddled; (K;) like أَمْهَرَ meaning “ he<br>\
(a breaker, or trainer,) rendered ” her “ a مَهْرِيَّة: ”<br>\
(TA:) or he took a camel in an untractable state<br>\
and rendered him such as is termed رَاحِلَة. (AZ,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And ارحلهُ He gave him a رَاحِلَة, (S,<br>\

-A2-  He (a camel)<br>\
became strong in his back, [so as to be fit for the<br>\
رَحْل (or saddle) or for journeying,] after weakness: (IDrd, K:) or he (a camel) became fat;<br>\
as though there came [what resembled] a رَحْل<br>\
upon his back, by reason of his fatness and his<br>\
[large] hump: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and ارحلت<br>\
الإِبِلُ The camels became fat after leanness, so as<br>\
to be able to journey. (S K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He (a<br>\
man, TA) had many [camels such as are termed]<br>\

استرحلهُ i. q. سَأَلَهُ أَنْ يَرْحَلَ لَهُ [which may<br>\
be rendered He asked him to remove, or journey,<br>\
to him: and also he asked him to bind, or put,<br>\
the رَحْل (or saddle of the camel) for him: the<br>\
former is the meaning accord. to the PS]. (S,<br>\
O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  استرحل النَّاسَ نَفْسَهُ means (assumed tropical:)  He abased<br>\
himself to men, or to the people, so that they<br>\

the thing that is put upon the camel for the purpose of riding thereon; (Er-Rághib, TA;) smaller<br>\

men, exclusively of women: (TA:) [this seems<br>\
to be regarded as the primary signification by the<br>\
authors of the Mgh and the K and by Er-Rághib:<br>\
but see what follows:] or it signifies the camel&#39;s<br>\
saddle together with his [girths called] رَبَض and<br>\
حَقَب and his [cloth called] حِلْس [that is put beneath the saddle], and all its other appertenances:<br>\
and is applied also to the pieces of wood of the<br>\
رَحْل, without any apparatus: (AO, Sh, TA:)<br>\
or it signifies anything, or everything, that a man<br>\
prepares for removing, or journeying; such as a<br>\
bag, or receptacle, for goods or utensils or apparatus, and a camel&#39;s saddle, and a [cloth such as<br>\
is called] حِلْس [that is put beneath the saddle],<br>\
and a رَسَن [or rope for leading his camel]:<br>\
(Msb:) or it signifies as first explained above, and<br>\
also the goods, or utensils, or apparatus, which a<br>\
man takes with him [during a journey]: (S, K,<br>\
TA:) [but accord. to the Msb, this signification<br>\
is from another, mentioned below; and the same<br>\
seems to be indicated in the S, which reverses the<br>\
order in which I have mentioned the three significations that I quote from it:] this last signification is disapproved by El-Hareeree, in the “ Durrat el-Ghowwás: ” [but see two exs. voce حُذَافَةٌ:]<br>\
the pl. is أَرْحُلٌ and رِحَالٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
the former a pl. of pauc.; (S, TA;) the latter, of<br>\
mult. (TA.) One says, حَطَّ رَحْلَهُ and أَلْقَى رَحْلَهُ<br>\
[He put down his camel&#39;s saddle]; meaning he<br>\
stayed, or abode. (TA.) And هٰذَا مَحَطُّ الرِّحَالِ<br>\
[This is the place where the camels&#39; saddles are<br>\
put down]. (TA.) And in reviling, one says,<br>\
يَا ابْنَ مُلْقَىأَرْحُلِ الرُّكْبَانِ [O son of the place in<br>\
which are thrown down the camels&#39; saddles of<br>\
the riders; as though the person thus addressed<br>\
were there begotten]; (S, O, TA;) meaning<br>\
يَا ابْنَ الفَاجِرَةِ [O son of the adulteress or fornicatress]: (TA in art. لقى:) or هُوَ ابن ملقى ارحل<br>\
الركبان [He is the son &amp;c.]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Er-Rághib, after giving the explanation mentioned<br>\
as on his authority above, says that it is then<br>\
sometimes applied to The camel [itself]: and is<br>\
sometimes used in the sense next following; i. e.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  A part, of a place of alighting or abode, upon<br>\
which on sits: (TA:) or a man&#39;s dwelling, or<br>\
habitation; (S, K, TA;) [in the first of which,<br>\
this commences the art., app. showing that the<br>\
author held this to be the primary signification;])<br>\
his house or tent; and his place of alighting or<br>\
abode: (TA:) a place to which a man betakes<br>\
himself, or repairs, for lodging, covert, or refuge;<br>\
a man&#39;s place of resort; (Mgh, Msb;) in a<br>\
region, district, or tract, of cities, towns, or<br>\
villages, and of cultivated land: and then applied<br>\
to the goods, utensils, or apparatus, of a traveller;<br>\
because they are, in travelling, the things to<br>\
which he betakes himself: (Msb:) pl. أَرْحُلٌ (TA)<br>\
and رِحَالٌ [as above]. (Mgh, TA.) One says,<br>\
دَخَلْتُ عَلَى الرَّجُلِ رَحْلَهُ, i. e. [I went in to the<br>\
man in] his dwelling, or place of abode. (TA.)<br>\
And it is said in a trad., إِذَا ابْتَلَّتِ النِّعَالُ فَصَلُّوا<br>\
فِى الرِّحَالِ, (TA,) or فِىلصَّلَاةُ فِى الرِّحَالِ, (Mgh,<br>\
and so in the TA in art. نعل,) i. e. [When the<br>\
نِعَال are moistened by rain, then pray ye, or then<br>\
prayer shall be performed,] in the houses, or<br>\
habitations, or places of abode; the نعال meaning<br>\
here the حِرَار; (IAth, TA in the present art.;)<br>\
or rugged and hard tracts of ground; which are<br>\
here particularized because the least wet moistens<br>\
them, whereas the soft tracts dry up the water:<br>\
(IAth, TA in art. نعل:) Az says that the meaning is, when the hard grounds are rained upon,<br>\
they become slippery to him who walks upon<br>\
them; therefore pray ye in your abodes, and<br>\
there shall not be anything brought against you<br>\
for your not being present at the prayer in the<br>\
mosques of the congregations: (TA in that art.:)<br>\
or the trad. may mean, then pray ye [on the<br>\
camels&#39; saddles, i. e.] riding. (TA in the present<br>\
art.) ―<br>\
-b4-  In another trad., it is related that &#39;Omar<br>\
said to the Prophet, حَوَّلْتُ رَحْلِىَ البَارِحَةَ; by the<br>\
word رَحْل, as signifying [properly] either the<br>\
“ place of abode and resort ” or the “ saddle upon<br>\
which camels are ridden,” alluding to his wife;<br>\
meaning غِشْيَانُهَا فِى قُبُلِهَا مِنْ جِهَةِ ظَهْرِهَا (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  رَحْلُ المُصْحَفِ means The thing [or desk]<br>\
upon which the مصحف [or copy of the Kur-án]<br>\
is put, in shape [somewhat] like the saddle.<br>\
(TA.) [It is generally a small desk of which<br>\
the front and back have the form of the letter X;<br>\
commonly made of palm-sticks.]<br>\
-A2-  [The pl.]<br>\
رَحَالٌ also signifies [Carpets, or cloths, or the<br>\
like, such as are called] طَنَافِس, of the fabric of<br>\
El-Heereh. (S, K.)<br>\
رُحْلَةٌ Strength; [app. in a camel, such as<br>\
renders fit for the saddle, or for journeying;]<br>\
and fleetness, or swiftness, and excellence: (TA:)<br>\
[and ↓ رِحْلَةٌ has a similar meaning, as appears<br>\
from what follows:] or excellence of pace of a<br>\
camel. (S voce حِضَارٌ.) You say بَعِيرٌ ذُو رُحْلَةٍ<br>\
and ↓ رِحْلَةٍ, and ↓ مِرْحَلٌ, like مِنْبَرٌ, (K,) or<br>\
↓ مُرْحِلٌ, and ↓ رَحِيلٌ, so in the T, (TA,) A strong<br>\
he-camel: (T, K:) and (so in the K [but properly<br>\
“ or ”]) بعير ذو رُحْلَةٍ (CK) or ↓ رِحْلَةٍ (K accord.<br>\
to the TA) or both, and ↓ مِرْحَلٌ, with kesr to the<br>\
م (O,) and ↓ جَمَلٌ رَحِيلٌ, (AA, S, S, O, K, TA,)<br>\
and ↓ نَاقَةٌ رَحِيلَةٌ (S, O) or رَحِيلٌ, (TA,) and<br>\
ذَاتُ رُحْلَةٍ, (S,) a he-camel, (S, O, K,) and a she-camel, (S, O,) strong to journey; (S, O, K, TA;)<br>\
so says Fr: (O:) or strong to be saddled: (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ نَاقَةٌ رَحِيلَةٌ and رَحِيلٌ and ↓ مُرْحِلَةٌ, accord.<br>\
to the “ Nawádir el-Aaráb,” a she-camel that is<br>\
excellent, generous, of high breed; or strong,<br>\
light, and swift; (TA;) and so ↓ مُسْتَرْحِلَةٌ. (K,<br>\
TA. [See also رَاحِلَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next<br>\
paragraph, in seven places.<br>\
رِحْلَةٌ The act of saddling of camels: (K, * TA:)<br>\
[and also, agreeably with analogy, a mode, or<br>\
manner, of saddling of camels:] so in the saying,<br>\
إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ الرِّحْلَةِ [Verily he is good in respect of<br>\
the saddling, or the mode or manner of saddling,<br>\
of camels]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A removal, departure,<br>\
or journey; (AZ, S, Msb, K;) and so ↓ رُحْلَةٌ,<br>\
(Lh, Msb, K,) and ↓ رَحِيلٌ: (S, K: [the last<br>\
said in the Msb to be and inf. n.:]) you say دَنَتْ<br>\
رِحْلَتُنَا (S) or قَرُبَتْ رِحْلَتُنَا (Msb) [Our removal,<br>\
&amp;c., drew near, or has drawn near]: and إِنَّهُ<br>\
لَذُو رِحْلَةٍ إِلَى المُلُوكِ and ↓ رِحْلَة Verily he is one<br>\
who journeys, or has journeyed, to the kings:<br>\
(Lh, TA:) and in like manner رُحْلَةٌ is used in the<br>\
Kur cvi. 2: (TA:) ―<br>\
-b3-  or ↓ رِحْلَةٌ with damm,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) signifies The thing to which one<br>\
removes, departs, or journeys; (AZ, Msb;) or<br>\
the direction, or point, or object, to which one<br>\
desires to repair, or betakes himself: (AA, S,<br>\
Msb, K:) and also, (K,) or رُحْلَةٌ, (TA,) a single<br>\
journey; (K, TA;) as ISd says: (TA:) you say,<br>\
↓ مَكَّةُ رُحْلَتِى Mekkeh is the point, or object, to<br>\
which I desire to remove, or depart, or journey:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ أَنْتُمْ رُحْلَتِى Ye are they to whom I<br>\
remove, or depart, or journey: (S, TA:) and<br>\
↓ أَنْتَ رُحْلَتُنَا Thou art the object to which we<br>\
repair, or betake ourselves. (Msb.) And hence<br>\
↓ رُحْلَةٌ is applied to signify A noble, or an exalted,<br>\
person, or a great man of learning, to whom one<br>\
journeys for his [the latter&#39;s] need, or want, or<br>\
for his [the former&#39;s] science. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also<br>\
the next preceding paragraph, in three places.<br>\
رَحُولٌ: see رَاحِلَةٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and رَحَّالٌ.<br>\
رَحِيلٌ A camel having the saddle (رَحْل [not<br>\
رحالة as in Freytag&#39;s Lex.]) put upon him; as<br>\
also ↓ مَرْحُولٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also رُحْلَةٌ, in four<br>\
places.<br>\
-A2-  As a simple subst, or, accord. to the<br>\
Msb, an inf. n.: see رِحْلَةٌ.<br>\
رِحَالَةٌ A سَرْج [or horse&#39;s saddle]: (K:) or a<br>\
سَرْج of skins, (S, M, Msb, K,) in which is no<br>\
wood; used for vehement running [of the horse]:<br>\
(S, M, K:) ISd says also that it is one of the<br>\
vehicles [or saddles] of women, like the رَحْل:<br>\
but Az says that it is one of the vehicles [or<br>\
saddles] of men, exclusively of women, i. e. not<br>\
of women; as is also the رَحْل: and some say that<br>\
it is larger than the سَرْج, covered with skins, and<br>\
is for horses, and for excellent, or strong and<br>\
light and swift, camels: (TA:) pl. رَحَائِلُ. (S.)<br>\
When a man is hasty in doing evil to his companion, one says to him, اِسْتَقْدَمَتْ رِحَالَتُكَ [lit.<br>\
Thy saddle has got before thee, or shifted forwards]: (S in the present art.:) it is a prov.,<br>\
meaning that has preceded than which another<br>\
was more fit to do so. (S in art. قدم.) In the<br>\
following saying of Imra-el-Keys, addressing<br>\
his wife,<br>\
فَإِمَّا تَرَيْنِى فِى رِحَالَةِ جَابِرٍ<br>\
عَلَى حَرَجٍ كَالْقَرِّتَخْفِقُ أَكْفَانِى<br>\
[And either thou wilt see me upon the saddle of<br>\
Jábir, upon a bier like the vehicle called قَرّ, my<br>\
grave-clothes fluttering], he means, by the word<br>\
رحالة, [merely] the حَرَج; there being in this<br>\
case no رحالة in reality: it is like the saying,<br>\
جَآءَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى نَاقَةِ الحَذَّآءِ, meaning [“ Such a<br>\
one came upon] the sandal [or sandals]: ” Jábir<br>\
is the name of a certain carpenter. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
A ewe. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA.) [Hence,] رِحَالَهْ رِحَالَهْ<br>\
is A call to the ewe, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K,) on the<br>\
occasion of milking. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
الرِّحَالَةُ is the name of A certain horse of &#39;Ámir<br>\
Ibn-Et-Tufeyl; (K;) erroneously said by AO<br>\
to be الحمالة. (TA.)<br>\
رَحُولَةٌ: see رَاحِلَةٌ.<br>\
رَحَّالٌ Skilled in the saddling of camels. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also A man who removes, or journeys, or<br>\
travels, much; and so ↓ رَحَّالَةٌ, [or rather this<br>\
signifies one who removes, or journeys, or travels,<br>\
very much,] and ↓ رَحُولٌ: and ↓ رُحَّلٌ [pl. of<br>\
رَاحِلٌ, q. v.,] persons who remove, or journey, or<br>\
travel, much. (TA.)<br>\
رَحَّالَةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
رَاحِلٌ Removing, (K, TA,) going, [going away,<br>\
departing, going forth,] or journeying: (TA:)<br>\
pl. رُحَّلٌ. (TA.) For another meaning assigned<br>\
to the pl., see رَحَّالٌ.<br>\
رَاحِلَةٌ A she-camel that is fit to be saddled;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) thus some say; (Msb;) as also<br>\
↓ رَحُولٌ (S, K) and ↓ رَحُولَةٌ: (K:) or [generally<br>\
a saddle-camel, or] a camel that is ridden, male<br>\
or female: (S, Msb:) accord. to IKt, a she-camel<br>\
that is strong to journey and to bear burdens;<br>\
and such as a man chooses for his riding and his<br>\
saddle on account of excellence, or generousness,<br>\
or high breed, or of strength and lightness and<br>\
swiftness, and of perfectness of make, and beauty<br>\
of aspect: but this explanation is wrong: (Az,<br>\
TA:) it signifies a he-camel, and a she-camel,<br>\
that is excellent, or generous, or high-bred, or<br>\
strong and light and swift: (Az, Mgh, TA:) the<br>\
she-camel is not more entitled to this appellation<br>\
than the he-camel: (Az, TA:) the ة is added<br>\
to give intensiveness to the signification; as in<br>\
دَاهِيَةٌ and بَاقِعَةٌ and عَلَّامَةٌ, epithets applied to a<br>\
man: or, as some say, the she-camel is so called<br>\
because she is saddled; and it is like عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ<br>\
meaning مَرْضِيَّةٌ, and مَآءٌ دَافِقٌ meaning مَدْفُوقٌ: or,<br>\
as others say, because she is ذَاتُ رَحْلٍ [one having<br>\
a saddle]; and in like manner, عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ means<br>\
ذَاتُ رَضًى, and مَآءٌ دَافِقٌ means ذُو دَفْقٍ: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. is رَوَاحِلُ. (S, Msb.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
تَجِدُونَ النَّاسَ بَعْدِى كَإِبِلٍ مِائَةٍ لَيْسَ فِيهَا رَاحِلَةٌ<br>\
[Thou wilt find the people, or mankind, after me,<br>\
like a hundred camels among which there is not<br>\
a راحلة]: (Mgh, * TA:) because the راحلْ among<br>\
a herd of camels is conspicuous and known.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَشَتْ رَوَاحِلِى, a phrase used by the<br>\
poet Dukeyn, means (tropical:)  I have become hoary and<br>\
weak: or, as some say, I have forsaken my ignorant, or foolish, behaviour, and have restrained<br>\
myself from foul conduct, and become obedient<br>\
to my censurers; like as the راحلة obeys her<br>\
chider, and goes. (TA.)<br>\

figured, or embellished. (Az, O, K, TA.) [It is<br>\
really, as well as literally, a pl.: for] a poet says,<br>\
عَلَيْهِنَّ رَاحُولَاتُ كُلِّ قَطِيفَةٍ<br>\

أَرْحَلُ (tropical:)  A horse white in the back; (S, Mgh,<br>\
K;) because it is the place of the رَحْل [or rather<br>\
of the رِحَالَة]; (Mgh, TA;) the whiteness not<br>\
reaching to the belly nor to the rump nor to the<br>\
neck: (TA:) and a sheep or goat black in the<br>\
back: accord. to Abu-l-Ghowth, the fem., رَحْلَآءُ,<br>\
applied to a mare, has the former meaning only:<br>\
(S:) but شَاةٌ رَحْلَآءُ means a sheep or goat, or a<br>\
ewe or she-goat, white in the back, and black in<br>\
the other parts; and likewise black in the back,<br>\
and white in the other parts: (S, K: *) so says<br>\
Abu-l-Ghowth: (S:) and it is also explained as<br>\
meaning black, but white in the place of the<br>\
saddle, from the hinder parts of the shoulderblades: also as meaning white, but black in the<br>\
back: Az adds that such as is white in one of the<br>\
hind legs is termed رَجْلَآءُ [with جيم]. (TA.)<br>\
تَرْحِيلٌ (assumed tropical:)  A whiteness predominating over, or<br>\
interrupted by, blackness, (شُهْبَةٌ,) or a redness,<br>\

-A2-  A camel strong in the back, [so as to be fit<br>\

or] the space which the traveller journeys in about<br>\
a day: (Msb:) sing. of مَرَاحِلُ; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
which is also a pl. of مُرَحَّلٌ as an epithet applied<br>\
to a بُرْد. (TA.) One says, بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَ كَذَا<br>\
مَرْحَلَةٌ أَوْمَرْحَلَتَانِ [Between me and such a place,<br>\
or thing, is a station or a day&#39;s journey or thereabout, or are two stations &amp;c.]. (S, TA.)<br>\
إِبِلٌ مُرَحَّلَةٌ Camels having their رِحَال [or<br>\
saddles] upon them: and also camels whose رِحَال<br>\
have been put down from them: thus having two<br>\
contr. meanings. (K.) ―<br>\

مِرْطٌ مُرَحَّلٌ,] i. e. an إِزَار [or a waist-wrapper] of<br>\
[the cloth called] خَزّ, upon which is an ornamented border, is not good: such is termed مُرَجَّلٌ,<br>\
