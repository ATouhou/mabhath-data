-b2-  [Hence,] ارذّ السِّقَآءُ, (inf. n. as above, T,)<br>\
(tropical:)  The water-skin, or milk-skin, exuded, or let<br>\
flow, what was in it. (T, A, L, K.) And ارذّت<br>\

↓ رَذَذٌ, (M, L,) Weak [or drizzling] rain, (S, M,<br>\
L, K,) but exceeding what is termed قِطْقِط:<br>\
(S, L:) or fine rain, but exceeding what is termed<br>\

termed طَلّ: (As, T:) or, accord. to El-Khattábee,<br>\

still, continuous rain, consisting of small drops,<br>\
resembling dust: or such as is after [app. meaning more than] what is termed طَلّ: (M, L, K:)<br>\
n. un. رَذَاذَةٌ. (M.) To such rain, the poet Bakhdaj, using the abbreviated form of the word,<br>\
likens some of his verses; not as meaning weak,<br>\
but as meaning continuous, or uninterrupted, and<br>\
unruffled; while he likens others of his verses to<br>\
rain such as is termed وَابِل. (M.) One says,<br>\
يَوْمُنَا يَوْمُ رَذَاذٍ وَسُرُورٍ وَالْتِذَاذٍ [Our day is a day of<br>\
fine rain, &amp;c., and of happiness, and of delectation]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (assumed tropical:)  A little wealth or property. (Har p. 57.) One says, نَحْنُ نَرْضَى<br>\

One says, السَّمَآءُ مُرِذٌّ وَالسَّمَاعُ مُلِذٌّ فَهَلْ أَنْتَ إِلَيْنَا مُغِذٌّ<br>\
[The sky is raining a fine rain, and what is being<br>\
heard is delighting: art thou, then, coming to us<br>\
quickly?]: meaning what is heard of discourse, or<br>\
narration, and of science; not of singing. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  Anything flowing. (T.)<br>\
