رَسَمَ الدَّارَ, (M,) or الدِّيَارَ, (K,) [aor.<br>\
رَسُمَ, accord.<br>\
to a rule of the K,] inf. n. رَسْمٌ, (M,) It (the rain)<br>\
rased the house or dwelling, or the houses or<br>\
dwellings, leaving a relic, or relics, thereof cleaving to the ground. (M, K.) In the saying of<br>\
El-Hotei-ah,<br>\
أَمِنْ رَسْمِ دَارٍ مُرْبِعٌ وَمُصِيفُ<br>\
لِعَيْنَيْكَ مِنْ مَآءِ الشُّؤُونِ وَكِيفُ<br>\
[Is it in consequence of autumn-rain&#39;s and springrain&#39;s rasing of a dwelling so as to leave only a<br>\
relic thereof cleaving to the ground, that there is<br>\
to thine eyes a distilling of the water of the tearchannels?], مربع and مصيف are in the nom. case<br>\
because of the inf. n., i.e. رسم. (M, TA. [But in<br>\
the latter, مَصِيفُ: and in a copy of the former,<br>\
مَرْبَعٌ and مَصِيفُ, both of which are evidently<br>\
wrong.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [رَسَمَ often signifies He marked, or<br>\
stamped: and he drew, traced, traced out, sketched,<br>\
sketched out, or planned: and he delineated, or<br>\
described.] You say, رَسَمَ الطَّعَامَ He stamped, or<br>\
sealed, the corn; (TA in art. رشم;) as also رَشَمَهُ.<br>\
(S, K, TA, all in that art. [See رَوْسَمٌ.]) And<br>\
رَسَمْتُ البِنَآءَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, I marked<br>\
out the building. (Msb.) And رَسَمَ كِتَابًا وَلَمْ<br>\
يَحْشُهُ [He sketched out a book and did not fill it<br>\

the book, or letter, or writing. (Msb.) And رَسَمَ<br>\
عَلَى كَذَا He wrote upon such a thing; (S, K;)<br>\
and رَشَمَ is a dial. var. thereof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,]<br>\
رَسَمَ لَهُ كَذَا, (S, K, TA,) or بِكَذَا, (Msb,) (tropical:)  [He<br>\
prescribed to him the doing of such a thing;] he<br>\
commanded, ordered, bade, or enjoined, him to do<br>\
such a thing. (S, * Msb, * K, TA.) [And رَسَمَ لَهُ<br>\
كَذَا also means (assumed tropical:)  he assigned, or appointed, him<br>\
such a thing, as a stipend, &amp;c.: often used in this<br>\
sense.] ―<br>\

aor.<br>\
رَسُمَ (S, M, [and so accord. to a rule of the K,])<br>\

رَسُمَ, (TA,) inf. n. رَسِيمٌ, (S, M, K,) She<br>\
made marks upon the ground (S, M, K) by the<br>\
vehemence of her tread. (S, M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And رَسَمَ said<br>\

رَسِمَ, inf. n. رَسِيمٌ, (S, K,) with<br>\
which مِرْسَمٌ is syn., (K,) He went a certain pace,<br>\
(S, K,) exceeding that which is termed ذَمِيل<br>\
[inf. n. of ذَمَلَ, q. v.]: one should not say of a<br>\
camel أَرْسَمَ, for this latter verb is trans. (S.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
Also رَسَمَ نَحْوَهُ, inf. n. رَسْمٌ, He went, or went<br>\
away, quickly towards him, or it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And<br>\
رَسَمَ فِى الأَرْضِ, (K,) inf. n. رَسْمٌ, (TA,) He disappeared in the land, or country: (K:) and<br>\
[hence], used metonymically, (tropical:)  he died; like<br>\

2<br>\

upon the ground (M, K) by the vehemence of her<br>\
tread. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He made a camel to go the<br>\
pace termed رَسِيم (S. [The meaning is there<br>\
indicated, but not expressed.]) فَأَرْسَمَا ending a<br>\
verse of Homeyd Ibn-Thowr [which is variously<br>\
related] refers to two boys, or young men, mentioned therein, and means فَأَرْسَمَا بَعِيرَيْهِمَا [And<br>\
they made their two camels to go the pace termed<br>\
رَسِيم]. (AHát, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
ترسّم, (K, but omitted in some copies,) or<br>\
ترسّم الرَّسْمَ, (M,) He looked at the رَسْمِ [or mark,<br>\
trace, relic, &amp;c.]. (M, K.) And ترسّم الدَّارَ He<br>\
considered, or examined, the رُسُوم [or marks,<br>\
traces, relics, &amp;c.,] of the house, or dwelling;<br>\
(S, TA; *) or did so repeatedly, in order to obtain<br>\
a clear knowledge thereof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And in like<br>\
manner ترسّم signifies He looked, and considered,<br>\
or examined, or did so repeatedly, in order to<br>\
know where he should dig, or build. (S, TA.)<br>\
Hence, تَرَسَّمَتِ القَنَافِذُ فِى الأَرْضِ (tropical:)  The hedge-hogs<br>\

memory, or sought, or endeavoured, to remember<br>\
it. (K, * TA.) And أَنَا أَتَرَسَّمُ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  I remember,<br>\
or I seek, or endeavour, to remember, such a<br>\
thing, but am not sure, or certain, of it. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِرْتِسَامٌ [in its primary sense, as quasi-pass.<br>\
of رَسْمٌ, inf. n. of رَسَمَ, is app. post-classical, but,<br>\
as such,] is used by the logicians as meaning The<br>\
being stamped and depicted [in the mind]: (“ Dict.<br>\
of the Technical Terms used in the sciences of<br>\
the Musalmans: ”] an image&#39;s being fixed in, or<br>\
upon, a thing. (KL.) [It is used, in this sense,<br>\
of an image formed by the fancy, and of any ideal<br>\
image.]<br>\
-A2-  [Also (tropical:)  The obeying a prescript or<br>\
command &amp;c.] You say, رَسَمْتُ لَهُ كَذَا, (S, K,)<br>\

(S,) (tropical:)  [I prescribed to him the doing of such a<br>\
thing; or] I commanded, ordered, bade, or enjoined, him to do such a thing, (K, TA,) and he<br>\
obeyed (S, Msb, TA) it [i. e. the prescript &amp;c.].<br>\
(S, Msb.) And ↓ أَنَا أَرْتَسِمُ مَرَاسِمَكَ (tropical:)  [I obey thy<br>\
prescripts &amp;c.;] I do not transgress thy مراسم.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (TA,) ارتسم signifies also<br>\
(tropical:)  He said اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرْ [God is great, or most great]:<br>\
(S, M, K, TA:) and he sought protection or preservation [by God]: (M, K, TA;) and he prayed<br>\
or supplicated or petitioned [God]: (S, K:) as<br>\
though [meaning] he took the course prescribed<br>\
by God, of having recourse to Him for protection<br>\
or preservation. (TA.) El-Aashà says, [speaking<br>\
of wine,]<br>\
وَصَلَّى عضلَى دَنِّهَا وَارْتَسَمْ  وَقَابَلَهَا الرِيحَ فِى دَنِّهَا<br>\
(S, M, TA,) or وَأَقْبَلَهَا, (so in some copies of the<br>\
S in this art. and in art. صلو, and in the Mgh,<br>\
also, in the latter art.,) i. e. [And he exposed it to<br>\
the wind, in its jar, and he prayed over its jar,]<br>\

صلو) that it might not become sour, nor spoil:<br>\
(TA in the latter art.:) AHn says that ارتسم<br>\
means he stamped its vessel with the رَوْسَم; but<br>\
this saying is not valid: (M, TA:) [and Mtr,<br>\
also, says that] ارتسم, here, is from الرَّوْسَمُ, and<br>\
means he stamped it. (Mgh in art. صلو.)<br>\
رَسْمٌ inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (Msb, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence<br>\
رَسْمُ المُصْحَفِ The writing of the book of the<br>\
Kur-án; for which particular rules are prescribed.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Hence also رَسْمٌ is sometimes used by logicians<br>\
as meaning A definition, either perfect (تَامٌّ) or<br>\
imperfect (نَاقِصٌ); like حَدٌّ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A mark,<br>\
an impression, a sign, a trace, a vestige, or a relic<br>\

or remains], as has not substance and height: (M,<br>\
K:) or such as is cleaving to the ground: (M:)<br>\
رَسْمُ دَارٍ means remains of a house or dwelling,<br>\
cleaving to the ground: (S, TA:) or رَسْمٌ signifies a remain, or remains, of a ruined dwelling or<br>\
place of alighting and abiding: (Har p. 607:)<br>\
and ↓ رَوْسَمٌ is syn. with رَسْمٌ: (S, M, K [accord.<br>\
to the correct copies of this last:]) the pl. [of<br>\
pauc.] of رَسْمٌ is أَرْسُمٌ and [the pl. of mult. is]<br>\
رُسُومٌ. (M, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [I. q. مَرْسُومٌ: see مَرَاسِمُ.<br>\
And hence, as being prescribed,] رُسُومُ الدِّينِ<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  The ways that are followed in respect of<br>\
the doctrines and practices of religion. (TA.) ―<br>\
