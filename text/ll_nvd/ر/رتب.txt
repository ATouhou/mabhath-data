and (TA) so ↓ ارتب, (K, TA, [but this I rather<br>\
think to be a mistranscription,]) said of a man:<br>\
mentioned in the T as on the authority of IAar.<br>\
(TA. [But in the T, I find only رَتَبَ in this<br>\
sense.]) So in the saying, رَتَبَ رُتُوبَ الكَعْبِ فِى<br>\
المَقامِ الصَّعْبِ [He stood erect like as does the<br>\
cockal-bone, or the die, in the difficult standingplace]: (S, * A, TA:) occurring in a trad. of<br>\

follows:] pl. of the former رُتَبٌ (MA) [and<br>\
رُتَبَاتٌ, for Az says that] رُتْبَةٌ signifies one of the<br>\

and the first, standing erect, or upright; (T,<br>\
TA;) applied to a thing, (T,) to a كَعْب [i. e.<br>\
cockal-bone, or die], and to a man. (TA.) You<br>\
say أَمْرٌ رَاتِبٌ A thing, or an affair, continual, or<br>\
uninterrupted, (دَارٌّ.) constant, firm, steady, &amp;c.:<br>\
and ↓ أَمْرٌ تُرْتَبٌ, the latter word of the measure<br>\
تُفْعَلٌ, with damm to the ت and fet-h to the ع, a<br>\
thing, or an affair, constant, firm, steady, &amp;c.<br>\
(S.) And عِزٌّ رَاتِبٌ Might, high rank or condition,<br>\
or the like, constant, firm, &amp;c. (A.) And عَيْشٌ<br>\
رَاتِبٌ Constant, or continual, (M, TA,) fixed,<br>\

(M, TA.) And مَا زِلْتُ عَلَى هٰذَا رَاتِبًا I ceased<br>\
not to be, or to do, thus constantly; as also<br>\
رَاتِمًا; in which, IJ says, the م is app. a substitute<br>\
for ب, because we have not heard رَتَمَ used like<br>\
رَتَبَ; but it may be radical, from الرَّتِيمَةُ. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [رَاتِبٌ in the modern language, used as a<br>\
subst., signifies A set pension, salary, and allowance; a ration; and any set office, or task: and<br>\

meaning [And we possessed excellence above the<br>\
people] all together: (M, TA:) thus accord. to<br>\
the reading commonly known: but, as some<br>\
relate it,<br>\
وَكَانَ لَنَا حَقًّا عَلَى النَّاسِ تُرْتَبَا<br>\
i. e. [And it was a just claim that we had upon<br>\
the people,] settled, or established. (TA.) The<br>\
first ت in تُرْتَبٌ is augmentative, because there is<br>\
no word like جُعْفَرٌ; and the derivation also is an<br>\
evidence of this, for the word is from الشَّىْءُ الرَّاتِبُ.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
-A2-  Also the second of these three words,<br>\
(T in art. ترب, and M, and L,) or the first of<br>\
them, (K,) A bad slave: (T, K:) or a slave<br>\

because of his continuance in slavery: [it being<br>\
a common custom for a man to make a good<br>\
slave free at his death:] mentioned by Th. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also the second, (Th, M, K,) and the first,<br>\
(K,) Dust, or earth; syn. تُرَابٌ: (Th, M, K:)<br>\

-b3-  And<br>\
the first, i. q. أَبَدٌ [Time, or duration, or continuance, or existence, without end; &amp;c.: or the<br>\
right reading may perhaps be آبِدٌ, i. e. remaining<br>\
constantly, &amp;c.]. (K.)<br>\
أَخَذَ فُلَانٌ تُرْتُبَّةً Such a one took what was like<br>\
a road, to tread it. (K, * TA.)<br>\
مَرْتَبَةٌ, and its pl. مَرَاتِبُ: see رُتْبَةٌ, in six places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to As, it signifies A place of observation, which is the summit of a mountain, or the<br>\
upper part thereof: (S:) accord. to Kh, (S,) the<br>\
مَرَاتِب in mountains and in deserts (صَحَارٍ) are<br>\
[structures such as are termed] أَعْلَام [pl. of عَلَمٌ,<br>\
q. v.,] upon which are stationed (↓ تُرَبُ) scouts,<br>\
or spies: (T, S:) or places to which scouts ascend,<br>\
in, or upon, mountains. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The pl. also<br>\
signifies Narrow and rugged parts of valleys.<br>\
(TA from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And the sing., Any difficult station or position. (M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also رَتَبٌ,<br>\

the language of the present day, it is applied to<br>\
A mattress, upon which to sit or recline or lie;<br>\
such as is spread upon a couch-frame or upon the<br>\
ground.]<br>\
