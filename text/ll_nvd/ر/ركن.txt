رَكَنَ إِلَيْهِ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
رَكُنَ; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) of the dial. of the lower (سُفْلَى) [app.<br>\
in territory] of Mudar, and said by Az to be not<br>\
chaste [thought it, or the third, seems to be the<br>\
most common of the dial. vars. here mentioned];<br>\
(Msb;) and رَكِنَ aor.<br>\
رَكَنَ; (S, Msb, K;) mentioned by AZ; (S;) and رَكَنَ, aor.<br>\
رَكَنَ; (S, Msb,<br>\
K;) which is a combination of two dial. vars.,<br>\
[namely, the first and second of those above mentioned,] (S, Msb,) because neither the medial<br>\
nor the final radical letter is faucial; (Msb;)<br>\
said to be the only instance of its kind except<br>\
أَبَى aor. يَأَبَى; (T in art. ابى;) and رَكِنَ, aor.<br>\
رَكُنَ;<br>\
which is likewise an instance of the commixture<br>\
of two dial. vars., like فَضِلَ and حَضِرَ and نَعِمَ,<br>\
aor. يَفْضُلُ and يَحْضُرُ and يَنْعُمُ; (TA;) inf. n.<br>\
رُكُونٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and رَكَانَةٌ and رَكَانِيَةٌ;<br>\
(TA;) He inclined to him, or it; syn. مَالَ: and<br>\
he trusted to, or relied upon, him, or it, so as to<br>\
be, or become, easy, or quiet, in mind; syn. سَكَنَ:<br>\
(S, Mgh, K:) or he leaned, rested, or relied, upon<br>\
him; syn. اِعْتَمَدَ عَلَيْهِ: (Msb:) or he inclined<br>\
to him in the least degree; (Bd in xi. 115;)<br>\
رُكُونٌ signifying slight inclining. (Ksh and Bd<br>\
ibid.) It is said in the Kur [xi. 115], وَلَا تَرْكَنُوا<br>\
إِلَى الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا [And incline ye not, &amp;c., to<br>\
those who have acted wrongfully]: (S, Msb:) or,<br>\
incline ye not in the least degree [&amp;c.]: (Bd:)<br>\
thus generally read; and also تِرْكَنُوا, (Ksh, Bd,<br>\
TA,) accord. to the dial. of Temeem; and ↓ تُرْكَنُوا,<br>\
in the pass. form, from أَرْكَنَهُ. (Ksh, Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
رَكِنَ فِى المَنْزِلِ, aor.<br>\
رَكَنَ, inf. n. رَكْنٌ, He kept<br>\
tenaciously to the place of alighting, or abode,<br>\
(ضَنَّ بِهِ,) and did not relinquish it. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
رَكُنَ, inf. n. رَكَانَةٌ (S, K) and رُكُونَةٌ (K) and<br>\
رَكَانِيَةٌ, (TK,) [primarily, it seems, said of a<br>\
mountain, meaning It was inaccessible, or difficult of access, having high, or strong أَرْكَان i. e.<br>\
sides or angles: see Har p. 561; and see رَكِينٌ,<br>\
below; and 5. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] (tropical:)  He (a man)<br>\
was, or became, firm, (Har p. 561,) still, or<br>\
motionless, (TA,) grave, staid, steady, sedate; or<br>\
calm. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
ركّن is said by Golius, as on the authority<br>\
of the KL, to signify He made like, “similem<br>\
fecit: ” and hence Freytag also thus explains it: but<br>\
it is زكّن that has this signification. In my copy<br>\
of the KL, تَزْكِينٌ (not تَرْكِينٌ) is expl. by<br>\
مانند كردن.]<br>\
4<br>\
اركنهُ He made him to incline [إِلَى غَيْرِهِ to<br>\
another]; syn. أَمَالَهُ: [and to trust to, or rely<br>\
upon, another, so as to be, or become, easy, or<br>\
quiet, in mind: or to lean, rest, or rely, upon<br>\
another: see 1:] whence a reading in the Kur<br>\
xi. 115. (Ksh, Bd. *) See 1.<br>\
5<br>\
تركّن said of a man, (TA,) [or primarily<br>\
and properly, of a thing, like رَكُنَ,] He, [or it]<br>\
was, or became, firm, or strong, (K, TA,) and<br>\
inaccessible, or difficult of access. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He endeavoured, or constrained himself, to be grave, staid, steady, sedate, or calm;<br>\
syn. تَوَقَّرَ, (K,) and تَرَزَّنَ. (TA.)<br>\
رَكْنٌ The جُرَذ [or large field-rat]: and the<br>\
فَأْر [or common rat or mouse]; as also ↓ رُكَيْنٌ.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
رُكْنٌ The جَانِب [meaning side, or outward<br>\
part,] of a thing: (Msb:) or the strongest جَانِب<br>\
[i. e. side, or outward part,] (S, K, TA) of a<br>\
thing (S, TA) of any kind: (TA:) the corner, or<br>\
angle, (زَاوِيَة,) of a house or room or the like:<br>\
(K in art. زوى:) [and this is perhaps what is<br>\
meant by the “ strongest جانب; ” for the strongest<br>\
outward part of the house is unquestionably the corner, or angle: thus the angle in which is the Black<br>\
Stone, of the Kaabeh, is specially called رُكْنُ<br>\
البَيْتِ, i. e. رُكْنُ بَيْتِ اللّٰهِ:] the رُكْن of a قَصْر<br>\
[or palace, or pavilion, &amp;c.,] is its جَانِب [or its<br>\
strongest جانب], and so of a mountain: (TA:<br>\
[see رَكُنَ, and رَكِينٌ:]) the pl. is أَرْكَانٌ and أَرْكُنٌ<br>\
[each properly a pl. of pauc., but the former is<br>\
used as a pl. of mult.]: (Msb, TA:) the أَرْكَان<br>\
of anything are is جَوَانِب [or sides, or outward<br>\
parts, or its corners, or angles,] upon which it<br>\
rests, and by which it is supported: (TA:) and<br>\
the أَرْكَان of a land are its extremities [or sides or<br>\
corners]. (Ham p. 478.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, (assumed tropical:)  A stay,<br>\
or support, of any kind: see an ex. voce مِرْجَمٌ:<br>\
whence, perhaps,] one says, تَمَسَّحْتُ بِأَرْكَانِهِ,<br>\
meaning تَبَرَّكْتُ بِهِ (tropical:)  [i. e. I looked for a blessing<br>\
by means of him, or it]. (TA.) (assumed tropical:)  A thing whereby<br>\
one is strengthened (مَا يُقَوَّى بِهِ [in the CK ما<br>\
تَقَوَّىبه]), such as dominion (مُلْك [in the CK<br>\
مَلِك]), and an army, or a military force, &amp;c.:<br>\
(K:) and thus it has been explained as occurring<br>\
in the Kur [li. 39], where it is said, فَتَوَلَّى بِرُكْنِهِ,<br>\
(TA,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  And he turned away from belief<br>\
with his forces; because they were to him like the<br>\
رُكْن [properly so termed]. (Jel.) (assumed tropical:)  A man&#39;s<br>\
kinsfolk; or nearer, or nearest, relations; or clan;<br>\
or tribe; syn. عَشِيرَةٌ: (AHeyth, TA:) (assumed tropical:)  a man&#39;s<br>\
people, or party; and the higher among them;<br>\
and the persons by whom he is aided and strengthened: thought by ISd to be thus called by way<br>\
of comparison [to a رُكْن properly so termed]:<br>\
and thus it has been explained as used in the Kur<br>\
[xi. 82], where it is said, أَوْ آوِىَ رُكْنٍ شَدِيدٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Or that I might have recourse to a strong<br>\
people, or party, &amp;c.]: (TA:) or it here means<br>\
عَشِيرَة [explained above]. (Jel.) And (assumed tropical:)  A noble,<br>\
or high, person; as in the saying, هُوَ رُكْنٌ مِنْ<br>\
أَرْكَانِ قَوْمِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He is a noble, of the nobles of his<br>\
people]. (TA.) And أَرْكَانُ الإِنْسَانِ means (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
members, or limbs, of the man, with which things<br>\
are gained or earned, or with which he works;<br>\
as the hands or arms, and the feet or legs. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Might, and resistance: (S, K:) so in<br>\
the saying, هُوَ يَأْوِى إِلَى رُكْنٍ شَدِيدٍ (assumed tropical:)  [He has<br>\
recourse to strong, or vehement, might and resistance]: (S:) and so it has been explained as used<br>\
in the words of the Kur last cited above. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A thing, an affair, a case, an event, or<br>\
an action, of great magnitude or moment, momentous, formidable, or terrible. (AHeyth, K.) Thus<br>\
AHeyth explains it as used in the saying of En-Nábighah [Edh-Dhubyánee],<br>\
لَا تَقْذِفَنِّى بِرُكْنٍ لَا كِفَآءَ لَهُ<br>\
[By no means reproach thou me with a momentous, or a formidable, thing or action, or an<br>\
enormity, that has not its equal; though (he<br>\
proceeds to say) the enemies incite thee, with<br>\
companies of men aiding one another]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  In the conventional language [of the schools],<br>\
رُكْنُ الشَّىْءِ means (assumed tropical:)  [The essence of the thing;<br>\
or] that whereby the thing subsists: from التَّقَوُّمُ;<br>\
because the قِوَام [or subsistence] of the thing is<br>\
by its رُكْن: not from القِيَام: else it would<br>\
necessarily be the case that the agent would be a<br>\
رُكْن to the action; and the substance, to the<br>\
accident; and the thing to which a quality is<br>\
attributed, to the quality: (KT:) it is (assumed tropical:)  that<br>\
without which the thing has no subsistence:<br>\
(Kull:) and is [also] applied to (assumed tropical:)  [an essential,<br>\
or essential part, of the thing; i. e.,] a part of<br>\
the مَاهِيَّة [or essence] of the thing, (Kull, [and in<br>\
like manner أَرْكَانُ الشَّىْءِ is explained in the Msb<br>\
as meaning the parts of the ماهيّة of the thing,])<br>\
as when we say that القِيَام is a رُكْن of الصَّلَاْة; as<br>\
well as to (assumed tropical:)  the whole مَاهيّة [of the thing]: (Kull:)<br>\
[thus] أَرْكَانُ العِبَادَاتِ means (assumed tropical:)  the fundamentals<br>\
[or essentials] of the services of religion, by the<br>\
neglect, or non-observance, of which they are<br>\
ineffectual, or null, or void: (TA:) or, as some<br>\
say, رُكْنُ الشَّىْءِ means that whereby the thing is<br>\
complete; and this is intrinsic therein; differing<br>\
from the شَرْط [or condition] thereof, which is<br>\
extrinsic thereto. (KT.)<br>\
رَكِينٌ A mountain having high أَرْكَان [i. e.<br>\
sides, or angles]: (S, K:) or having strong اركان:<br>\
(TA:) or inaccessible, or difficult of access, having<br>\
اركان. (Har p. 561.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (Har<br>\
ibid.,) (tropical:)  A man (S, K, &amp;c.) firm, (Har,) still, or<br>\
motionless, (TA,) grave, staid, steady, sedate, or<br>\
calm. (S, K, Har, TA.)<br>\
رُكَيْنٌ: see رَكْنٌ.<br>\
أَرْكُونٌ A great دِهْقَان, (K, TA,) i. e. headman,<br>\
or chief, of a village or town: [app. from the<br>\
Greek<br>\
ἄρχω ν; though it is said that] he is thus<br>\
called because the people of the village or town<br>\
trust to him and incline to him. (TA.)<br>\
مِرْكَنٌ A kind of vessel, well known, (K, TA,)<br>\
like a تَوْر [q. v.], of leather, used for water:<br>\
(TA:) or i. q. إِجَّانَةٌ [q.v.], (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,)<br>\
in which clothes and the like are washed; (TA;)<br>\
called in Pers. تَغَارْ: (Mgh:) pl. مَرَاكِنُ and<br>\
مَرَاكِينُ. (TA.) One says, زَرَعُوا الرَّيَا حِينَ فِى<br>\
المَرَاكِينِ [They sowed the sweet-smelling plants<br>\
in the مراكين]. (TA.)<br>\
مُرَكَّنٌ A thing having أَرْكَان [here meaning<br>\
corners, or angles]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ضَرْعٌ مُرَكَّنٌ<br>\
A great udder; as though having اركان: (S,<br>\
TA:) and an udder that has opened [or expanded]<br>\
in its place so as to fill the أَرْفَاغ [or groins], and<br>\
is not very long. (TA.) Tarafeh says,<br>\
وَضَرَّتُهَا مُرَكَّنَةٌ دَرُورُ<br>\
[And her udder is great, having much milk: or,]<br>\
accord. to AA, مركّنة [here] signifies مجمّعة<br>\
[app. meaning collecting much]. (TA.) And<br>\
you say also نَاقَةٌ مُرَكَّنَةُ الضَّرْعِ (S, TA) [A she-camel great in the udder; or] whose udder has<br>\
أَرْكَان by reason of its greatness. (TA.)<br>\
