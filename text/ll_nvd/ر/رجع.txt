رَجَعَ, aor.<br>\
رَجِعَ, inf. n. رُجُوعٌ (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.)<br>\
and رَجْعٌ, (M, Msb,) but the former is that which<br>\
commonly obtains and is agreeable with analogy<br>\
as inf. n. of the intrans. v., and the latter as inf. n.<br>\
of the trans. v., (MF, TA,) and مَرْجَعٌ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K, &amp;c.,) which is anomalous, because inf. ns. [of<br>\
this kind] of verbs of the measure فَعَلَ having the<br>\
aor. of the measure يَفْعِلُ are [by rule] only with<br>\
fet-h [to the medial radical], (S, K,) and مَرْجِعَةٌ,<br>\
which is in like manner anomalous, (K,) and<br>\
رُجْعَى, (S, Msb, K,) [not رُجْعًى as in the Lexicons<br>\
of Golius and Freytag,] and رُجْعَانٌ, (K,) He<br>\
returned; he went, or came, back [to the same<br>\
place, or person, or (assumed tropical:)  state, or (assumed tropical:)  occupation, or<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  action, or (assumed tropical:)  saying, &amp;c.]; he reverted; contr. of<br>\
ذَهَبَ; (ISk, Msb;) i. q. انْصَرَفَ: (K:) رُجُوعٌ<br>\
signifies the returning to a former place, or<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  quality, or (assumed tropical:)  state; (Kull p. 196;) the returning<br>\
to that from which was the commencement, or<br>\
from which the commencement is supposed to have<br>\
been, whether it be a place, or (assumed tropical:)  an action, or (assumed tropical:)  a<br>\
saying, and whether the returning be by the<br>\
[whole] person or thing, or by a part thereof, or<br>\
by an action thereof. (Er-Rághib.) Hence the<br>\
saying in the Kur [lxiii. 8], لَئِنْ رَجَعْنَا إِلَى المَدِينَةِ<br>\
[Verily if we return to the city]. (Er-Rághib.)<br>\
And [in the same, xii. 63,] فَلَمَّا رَجَعُوا إِلَى أَبِيهِمْ<br>\
[And when they returned to their father].<br>\
(Idem.) And in the same, [vi. 164, and xxxix.<br>\
9,] ثُمَّ إِلَى رَبِّكُمْ مَرْجِعُكُمْ [Then unto your Lord<br>\
shall be your return]: (S:) the like of which<br>\
occurs in the same, vi. 60: but it may be either<br>\
from [the intrans. inf. n.] رُجُوعٌ or from [the<br>\
trans.] رَجْعٌ: (Er-Rághib:) it cannot be a n. of<br>\
place, because it is made trans. by means of إِلَى,<br>\
and also because it occurs in the Kur [v. 53, &amp;c.],<br>\
followed by جَمِيعًا, as a denotative of state: (L:)<br>\
in like manner الرُّجْعَى also occurs in the Kur<br>\
xcvi. 8. (TA.) You say also, رَجَعَتِ المَرْأَةُ إِلَى<br>\
أَهْلِهَا The woman returned to her family by<br>\
reason of the death of her husband or by reason<br>\
of divorcement. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَجَعَ إِلَى الصِّحَّةِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [He returned to soundness, or health], or المَرَضِ<br>\
[disease, or sickness]; and إِلَى حَالَةِ الفَقْرِ (assumed tropical:)  [to the<br>\
state of poverty], or الغِنَى (assumed tropical:)  [wealth, or competence, or sufficiency]. (Kull p. 196.) ―<br>\
-b3-  رَجَعَ<br>\
عَوْدَهُ عَلَى بَدْئِهِ He returned in the way by which<br>\
he had come. (Kull ibid.) ―<br>\
-b4-  رَجَعَ مِنْ سَفَرِهِ He<br>\
returned from his journey. (Msb.) ―<br>\

(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b6-  رَجَعَ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ (assumed tropical:)  He left, or relinquished, the thing. (Kull p. 197.) ―<br>\
-b7-  رَجَعَ عَنِ<br>\
الذَّنْبِ (assumed tropical:)  [He relinquished sin; i. e.] he repented;<br>\
and so رَجَعَ alone, agreeably with the usage in<br>\
the Kur iii. 65, &amp;c. (Er-Rághib.) ―<br>\
-b8-  [Several<br>\
other phrases, in which this verb occurs, will be<br>\
found in other arts.: as رَجَعَ عَلَى ظَهْرِهِ in art.<br>\
ظهر: رَجَعْتُ القَهْقَرَى in art. قهقر: رَجَعَ دَرَجَهُ, and<br>\
variations thereof, in art. درج: &amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b9-  رَجَعَ إِلَيْهِ<br>\
[sometimes signifies the same as رَجَعَ عَلَيْهِ] He<br>\
returned against him; he returned to attack him.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  صَرَمّنِى ثُمَّ رَجَعَ يَكَلِّمُنِى (tropical:)  [He cut me,<br>\
or ceased to speak to me; then he returned to<br>\
speaking to me]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  خَالَفَنِى ثُمَّ رَجَعَ إِلَى<br>\
قَوْلِى (tropical:)  [He opposed me, or disagreed with me;<br>\

-b12-  مَا رُجِعَ إِلَيْهِ فِى خَطْبٍ إِلَّا كَفَى (tropical:)  [Re<br>\
course was not had to him in an affair, or an<br>\
affliction, but he sufficed.] (TA.) [رَجَعَ إِلَيْهِ<br>\

him, or it.] ―<br>\
-b13-  رَجَعَ بِهِ عَلَى شَرِيكِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He made a<br>\
claim for restitution of it upon his co-partner.<br>\
(IAth, TA in art. خلط.) And [in like manner<br>\
you say,] عَلَى الغَرِيمِ ↓ اِرْتَجَعَ, and المُتَّهَمِ, (assumed tropical:)  He sued,<br>\
prosecuted, or made a demand upon, the debtor,<br>\
and the suspected, for his right, or due. (TA:<br>\
[in which it is said, immediately before this, that<br>\
ارتجع is like رَجَعَ.]) ―<br>\
-b14-  رَجَعَ الكَلْبُ فِى قَيْئِهِ The<br>\
dog returned to his vomit, (Msb, TA,) and ate it.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b15-  Hence, رَجَعَ فِى هِبَتِهِ (tropical:)  He took back<br>\
his gift; repossessed himself of it; restored it to<br>\
his possession; (Msb;) as also ↓ ارتجعها, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA,) and ↓ استرجعها. (Msb, TA.) And<br>\
مِنْهُ الشَّىْء ↓ استرجع (assumed tropical:)  He took back from him the<br>\
thing which he had given to him. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b16-<br>\
[Hence also, رَجَعَ فِى قَوْلِهِ, and فِى حُكْمِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
retracted, or revoked, his saying, and his judgment, or sentence.] ―<br>\
-b17-  هُوَ يَرْجِعُ إِلَى مَنْصِبِ صِدْقٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He traces back his lineage to an excellent origin.<br>\
(TA in art. نصب.) ―<br>\
-b18-  [يَرْجِعُ إِلَى مَعْنَى كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
(a word used in a certain sense) is referrible, or<br>\
reducible, to such a meaning. And يُرْجِعُ إِلَى كَذَا,<br>\
said of a word, also means (assumed tropical:)  It relates to such a<br>\
thing; i. e., to such another word, in grammatical<br>\
construction.] ―<br>\
-b19-  رَجَعَ إِلَى قَدْرِ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  It (wine<br>\
when cooked) became reduced to such a quantity;<br>\
syn. آلَ. (S in art. اول.) ―<br>\

The water of the trough, or tank, became much in<br>\
quantity [so that it returned to the height of the<br>\
place whence it poured in]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b21-  ↓ رِجَاعٌ,<br>\
also, is an inf. n. of this verb, (L,) and is used as<br>\
signifying The returning of birds after their<br>\
migrating to a hot country. (S, L, K.) You say,<br>\
رَجَعَتِ الطَّيْرُ القَوَاطِعُ, inf. n. رِجَاعٌ and رَجْعٌ,<br>\
The migratory birds returned. (L.) ―<br>\
-b22-  Also<br>\
inf. n. of رَجَعَتْ said of a-she camel, and of a she-ass, signifying (assumed tropical:)  She raised her tail, and compressed her two sides (قُطْرَيْهَا), and cast forth her<br>\
urine in repeated discharges, so that she was<br>\
imagined to be pregnant, (S, K,) and then failed<br>\
of fulfilling her [apparent] promise: (S: [in<br>\
some copies of which, as is said in the TA, the<br>\
inf. n. of the verb in this sense is written رُجُوع:])<br>\
or she conceived, and then failed of fulfilling her<br>\
promise; because she who does so goes back from<br>\
what is hoped of her: (TA:) or, said of a she-camel, she cast forth her fœtus in an imperfect<br>\
state: (AZ, TA,) or, as some say, her embryo<br>\
in a fluid state: (TA:) or in an unformed state;<br>\
inf. n. رِجَاعٌ. (Msb in art. خدج.) [See also<br>\
رَاجِعٌ, below.]<br>\
-A2- , (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. رَجَعَهُ,<br>\
(Mgh,) inf. n. رَجْعٌ and مَرْجَعٌ and مَرْجِعٌ, (K,)<br>\
He made, or caused, him, or it, to return, go<br>\
back, come back, or revert; sent back, turned<br>\
back, or returned, him, or it; syn. رَدَّهُ; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K;) and صَرَفَهُ; (K;) عَنِ الشَّىْءِ from the<br>\
thing; and إِلَيْهِ to it; (Msb, K;) as also ↓ ارجعهُ;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) but the former is the more chaste<br>\
word, and is that which is used in the Kur-án, in<br>\
ix. 84 [and other places]: (Msb:) the latter is of<br>\
the dial. of Hudheyl; (S, Msb;) and is said by<br>\
MF to be of weak authority, and bad; but [SM<br>\
says,] I do not find this asserted by any of the<br>\
leading authorities: (TA:) ↓ ارتجعهُ, also, signifies [the same, i. e.] the same as رَدَّهُ in like<br>\
manner followed by إِلَى. (TA.) Thus in the<br>\
Kur ix. 84, referred to above, فَإِنْ رَجَعَكَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
[And if God make thee to return, or restore<br>\
thee]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَجَعَ فُلَانٌ عَلِى أَنْفِ بَعِيِرهِ Such<br>\
a one put back, or restored, the nose-rein [الخِطَامَ<br>\

الجَوَابَ, aor.<br>\
رَجِعَ, inf. n. رَجْعٌ and رُجْعَانٌ, He<br>\
returned to me the answer. (S, TA: [in the<br>\
latter of which, this is said to be tropical; but<br>\
when a written answer is meant, it is evidently<br>\
not so.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  رَجَعْتُ الكَلَامَ (assumed tropical:)  I returned the speech;<br>\
or I repeated it; or I rebutted, or rejected, or<br>\
repudiated, it, in reply, or replication; syn.<br>\
رَدَدْتُهُ. (Msb.) [In like manner,] يَرْجِعُ بَعْضُهُمْ<br>\
إِلَى بَعْضٍ القَوْلَ, in the Kur [xxxiv. 30], means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Holding a colloquy, or a disputation, or debate,<br>\
one with another: (Bd:) [or it means (assumed tropical:)  rebutting<br>\
one another&#39;s sayings:] or (assumed tropical:)  blaming one another.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b5-  الرَّجْعُ, (K,) or رَجْعُ الدَّابَّةِ يَدَيْهَا فِى السَّيْرِ,<br>\
(S,) (tropical:)  The stepping of the beast, (S, K,) or her<br>\
returning her fore legs, [drawing the fore feet<br>\

high,] in going; (K;) and ↓ التَّرْجِيعُ, (K,) or<br>\
تَرْجِيعُ الدَّابّةِ يَدَيْهَا فِى السَّيْرِ, (S,) signifies the<br>\
same: (S, K:) or رَجْعٌ signifies a beast&#39;s elevating,<br>\
or lifting high, the fore foot and hind foot, in<br>\
going. (KL.) You say, الدَّابَّةُ يَدَيْهَا فِى ↓ رَجَّعَتِ<br>\
السَّيْرِ (tropical:)  [The beast stepped, &amp;c.; like as you say,<br>\
رَجَعَت]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  رَجْعُ الوَاشمَةِ, and ↓ تَرْجَيعُهَا,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The female tattooer&#39;s making marks or lines<br>\
[upon the skin]: (S, K: *) [or rather, as the<br>\
former phrase is explained in the EM p. 143,<br>\
“ her retracing ” those marks or lines, and<br>\
renewing their blackness; for] you say also,<br>\
النَقْشَ ↓ رَجَّعَ, and الوَشْمَ, [and رَجَعَهُ,] (assumed tropical:)  He retraced<br>\
the marks, or lines, of the variegated work, and<br>\
of the tattooing, and renewed their blackness, one<br>\
time after another. (TA.) And الكِتَابَةَ ↓ رَجَّعَ,<br>\
[and رَجَعَهَا,] (assumed tropical:)  He retraced, or renewed, the writing.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  رَجَعَ نَاقَةً, and ↓ ارتجعها, and ↓ ترجّعها,<br>\
He purchased a she-camel with the price of<br>\
another that he sold: (S, TA:) or he purchased<br>\
a she-camel with the price of a he-camel that he<br>\
sold; and ↓ رِجَعٌ, which is app. an inf. n., signifies<br>\
the selling males and purchasing females: (TA:)<br>\
or مَالًا ↓ ارتجع signifies he sold the aged and the<br>\
younglings of his came&#39;s, and purchased such as<br>\
were in a state of youthful vigour: or, as some<br>\
say, he sold the males, and purchased females:<br>\
(Lh:) or ↓ اِرْتِجَاعٌ signifies the selling a thing,<br>\
and purchasing in its place what one imagines to<br>\
be more youthful, and better: (Lh in another<br>\
place:) regard is bad, therein, to the meaning of<br>\
a return, virtual, or understood, though not real:<br>\
(Er-Rághib:) also إِبِلًا ↓ ارجع he sold old and<br>\
weak camels, and purchased such as were in a<br>\
state of youthful vigour: or he sold male camels,<br>\
and purchased females: (TA:) and إِبِلًا ↓ ارتجع<br>\
بِإِبِلِهِ he took camels in exchange for his camels:<br>\
or, as some say, ↓ اِرْتِجَاعٌ signifies the taking one<br>\
in the place, and with the price, of two. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  رَجَعَ العَلَفُ فِى الدَّابَّةِ (tropical:)  The fodder, or food,<br>\
produced an effect, or showed its effect, upon the<br>\
beast. (K, * TA.) And رَجَعَ كَلَامِى فِيهِ (tropical:)  My<br>\
speech produced a beneficial effect upon him.<br>\
(K, * TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
رجّعهُ, inf. n. تَرْجِيعٌ, He, or it, made, or<br>\
caused, him, or it, to return, go back, come back,<br>\
or revert, again and again, or time after time;<br>\
sent back, turned back, or returned, him, or it,<br>\
again and again, or time after time; made, or<br>\
caused, him, or it, to go, or move, repeatedly to<br>\
and fro; so to go and come; to reciprocate: he<br>\
repeated it; iterated it; or rather reiterated it:<br>\
he reproduced it: he renewed it: syn. رَدَّدَهُ.<br>\
(Mgh.) [All these significations are well known,<br>\
as pertaining to the two verbs here mentioned,<br>\
and of frequent occurrence in classical and postclassical writings: and hence several phrases here<br>\
following.] ―<br>\
-b2-  See 1, last quarter of the paragraph, in five places. ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence, (Mgh,) التَّرْجِيعُ<br>\
فِى الأَذَانِ, (S, Mgh, K,) because the two professions of the faith [for which see the word أَذَانٌ]<br>\
are uttered in the اذان [or call to prayer] in a low<br>\
voice [and then repeated in a high voice]; (Mgh;)<br>\
[for] this phrase means (tropical:)  The repeating the two<br>\
professions of the faith in a raised, or loud,<br>\
voice, after uttering them in a low, or faint,<br>\
voice; (Sgh, K, TA;) or the lowering of the<br>\
voice in the اذان in uttering the two professions<br>\
of the faith, and then raising it in uttering them:<br>\
(KT:) or رجّع فِى أَذَانِهِ signifies he uttered the<br>\
two professions of the faith in his اذان once to<br>\
repeat them. (Msb: [but this is a strange explanation; and probably corrupted by a copyist:<br>\
it seems that, instead of “ to repeat them,” we<br>\
should read “ and repeated them. ”]) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence<br>\
also,] التَّرْجِيعُ, (K, TA,) or تَرْجِيعُ الصَّوْتِ, (S,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The act of quavering, or trilling; rapidly<br>\
repeating many times one very short note, or<br>\
each note of a piece; a general characteristic of<br>\
Arabian chanting and singing and piping, and<br>\
often continued throughout the whole performance;] the reiterating (تَرْدِيد) of the voice in<br>\
the throat, or fauces, (S, K, TA,) like [as is<br>\
done in] chanting, (S,) or which is practised in<br>\
reading or reciting, or singing, or piping, or other<br>\
performances, of such as are accompanied with<br>\
quavering, or trilling: (TA:) or, as some say,<br>\
the mutual approximation of the various kinds of<br>\
movements in the voice: &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Mughaffal, in his ترجيع, by the prolonging of the<br>\
voice, in reading, or reciting, imitated the like of<br>\
آا آا آا. (TA.) You say also, رجّع الحَمَامُ فِى<br>\
غِنَائِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [The pigeons quavered in their singing, or<br>\
cooing]; as also ↓ استرجع. (TA.) And رجّع<br>\

back by marriage or to the marriage-state, after<br>\
having divorced her; (see also 6;)]; (S;) and<br>\
↓ ارتجعها signifies the same. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [See also<br>\
a verse cited voce رَدَادٌ; whence it seems that<br>\
راجع also signifies He restored, or brought back,<br>\
anything.] ―<br>\
-b6-  راجعهُ signifies also He endeavoured<br>\
to turn him [from, or to, a thing]; syn. رَاوَدَهُ,<br>\
and رَادَّهُ. (L in art. رود.) ―<br>\
-b7-  راجعهُ الكَلَامَ, (S and<br>\
K in this art., and A and Mgh and Msb in art.<br>\
حور,) and فِى الكَلَامِ, (Bd in xviii. 32,) and<br>\

ارجعت النَّاقَةُ (assumed tropical:)  [The she-camel returned to<br>\
her former condition, either of leanness or fatness:] (assumed tropical:)  the she-camel became lean [after having<br>\
been fat]: and (assumed tropical:)  became in good condition after<br>\

K;) so says Ks. (S.) You say also, الشَّيْخُ<br>\
يَمْرَضُ يُوْمَيْنِ فَلَا يُرْجِعُ شَهْرًا (assumed tropical:)  i. e. [The old man<br>\

healthy state of body, and to strength, in a<br>\

stretched out, his arm, or hand, backwards, to<br>\
reach, or take hold of, a thing. (S, K.) [In this<br>\
case, يَدَهُ seems to be understood: for] you say<br>\

here next follows, and which is also, but less<br>\

is, [Our father charged us with the seekings<br>\
