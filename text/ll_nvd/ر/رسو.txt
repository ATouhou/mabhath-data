رَسَا, (S, M, Msb, K,) aor. يَرْسُو, (S, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. رُسُوٌّ (M, Msb, K) and رَسْوٌ, (K,) It (a<br>\
thing, S, M, Msb) was, or became, stationary, at<br>\
rest, fixed, fast, firm, steady, steadfast, or stable;<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K) as also ↓ ارسى, (M, K,) inf. n.<br>\
إِرْسَآءٌ; and ↓ ترسّى. (TA.) الرسو and الرسوخ [i. e.<br>\
الرُّسُوُّ and الرُّسُوخُ] are nearly the same [in meaning]. (Ham p. 51.) You say, رَسَا الجَبَلُ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
mountain was firmly based, or firm in its base,<br>\
upon the ground. (TA.) And ثَبِيرٌ ↓ مَا أَرْسَى (tropical:)  As<br>\
long as Thebeer [the mountain so called] remains<br>\
[firm] in its place. (TA.) [Its being said that<br>\
this is tropical is app. meant to indicate that the<br>\
verbs above are properly used only in relation to<br>\
a ship, in senses explained in what follows; which,<br>\
however, I doubt.] You say also, رَسَتْ قَدَمُهُ,<br>\
meaning His foot stood firm in war: (M:) or<br>\
رَسَتْ أَقْدَامُهُمْ فِى الحَرْبِ Their feet stood firm in<br>\
war. (S, Msb. *) And رَسَتِ السَّفِينَةُ, (S, M, K,)<br>\
aor. تَرْسُو, inf. n. رُسُوٌّ and رَسْوٌ (S) [and مَرْسًى, as<br>\
shown below, see 4], The ship [anchored; cast<br>\
anchor; lay at anchor; or] rested, or became<br>\
stationary, upon the anchor: (T, S, K:) in [some<br>\
of] the copies of the K [and of the S], عَلَى البَحْرِ<br>\
is erroneously put for على الأَنْجَرِ [or على اللَّنْجَرِ]:<br>\
(TA:) or the meaning is, [in some instances,<br>\
the ship grounded; i. e.] the lower, or lowest, part<br>\
of the ship reached the bottom of the water, and<br>\
she consequently remained stationary. (T, M,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَسَا الفَحْلُ بِشَوْلِهِ (S, M, K,) (tropical:)  The stallion [-camel] leaped, or leaped upon, his شول [or<br>\
she-camels that had passed seven or eight months<br>\
since the period of their bringing forth]: (S,<br>\
TA:) or brayed to his شول, and they became<br>\
motionless, or still: (M:) or brayed to his شول<br>\
when they had dispersed themselves from him,<br>\
and they turned aside to him, and became motionless, or still. (K, TA.) ―<br>\

مِنْ حَدِيثٍ (S, * M, K *) He mentioned to him a<br>\
part, or portion, of a tradition, or story. (S,<br>\

حَدِيثًا, (S, M, K,) inf. n. رَسْوٌ, (M,) He related a<br>\
tradition, or story, as received from him, (S, M,<br>\
K,) ascribing it to him. (M, K.) And رَسَا<br>\
الحَدِيثَ فِى نَفْسِهِ He related the tradition, or<br>\
story, to himself. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَسَا الصَّوْمَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
رَسْوٌ, (TA,) He intended, or purposed, fasting. (K.)<br>\
3<br>\
راساهُ, (T, K,) inf. n. مُرَاسَاةٌ, (TA,) i. q. سَابَحَهُ,<br>\
(T, K,) i. e. He swam with him. (TK.)<br>\
4<br>\
ارسى, inf. n. إِرْسَآءٌ: see 1, in two places.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
ارساهُ He made it (a thing, M, Msb) to become<br>\
stationary, at rest, fixed, fast, firm, steady, steadfast, or stable. (M, Msb, K.) And ارسى السَّفِينَةَ,<br>\
[inf. n. as above and also (as is shown by what<br>\
follows) مُرْسًى, He anchored the ship;] he made<br>\
the ship to rest, or become stationary, upon the<br>\
anchor: (TA:) or the meaning is, [in some instances, he grounded the ship; i. e.] he made the<br>\
lower, or lowest, part of the ship to reach the<br>\
bottom of the water, so that she remained stationary. (M, TA.) You say also of a ship,<br>\
تُرْسَى بَالأَنْجَرِ [She is made fast by means of the<br>\
anchor]: (M:) and of the anchor, يُرْسِى السَّفِينَةَ<br>\
It makes fast the ship, so that it does not go on.<br>\
(T, TA.) For the words of the Kur [xi. 43],<br>\
بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ مُجْرَاهَا وَمُرْسَاهَا, (S, M, * K, *) meaning<br>\
إِجْرَاؤُهَا وَإِرْسَاؤُهَا [i. e. In the name of God be the<br>\
making it to run and the making it to rest],<br>\
(Aboo-Is-hák, TA,) from أَجْرَيْتُ and أَرْسَيْتُ, (so<br>\
in one copy of the S,) or [its being made to run<br>\
and its being made to rest,] from أُجْرِيَتْ and<br>\
أُرْسِيْتْ, (so in another copy of the S,) some say<br>\
مَجْرَاهَا وَمَرْسَاهَا, (S, K,) meaning its running and<br>\
its resting, (Aboo-Is-hák, TA,) from جَرَتْ and<br>\
رَسَتْ, (S, K,) [though] Az says that the readers<br>\
agree in pronouncing the م of مرساها with damm,<br>\
but differ as to the م of مجراها, the Koofees pro-<br>\
nouncing this with fet-h, (TA,) or the latter reading may have the same meaning as the former,<br>\
(Aboo-Is-hák, TA,) or the former reading may<br>\
mean in the time, or the place, of making it to<br>\
run, and that of making it to rest, and the latter<br>\
reading may mean in the time, or the place, of its<br>\
running, and that of its resting, for in each case<br>\
each noun may be a n. of time or a n. of place or<br>\
an inf. n.; (Bd, q. v.;) and some read مُجْرِيهَا<br>\
↓ وَمُرْسِيهَا, as epithets applied to God, (M, K,)<br>\
who maketh it to run and who maketh it to rest.<br>\
(TA.) Accord. to Zj, (M,) يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ<br>\
أَيَّانَ مُرْسَاهَا, in the Kur [vii. 186 and lxxix. 42],<br>\
means [They will ask thee respecting the ساعة,]<br>\
when will be its taking place? [or when will be the<br>\
time of its being made to take place?]; (M, K; *)<br>\
by the ساعة being meant the time in which all<br>\
created beings shall die. (M.)<br>\

of beads: (ISK, TA:) or a bracelet of ذَبْل [i. e.<br>\
turtle-shell, or tortoise-shell]: pl. رَسَوَاتٌ: it has<br>\
no broken pl. (M, TA. [Golius and Freytag say<br>\
that its pl. is رِسًى; but on what authority, I know<br>\
not: the former mentions no authority beside the<br>\
S and K; and the latter, none but the K.])<br>\
رَسِىٌّ Firm, or steadfast, in good and in evil.<br>\
(Az, Sgh, K.) ―<br>\

And قِدْرٌ رَاسِيَةٌ (tropical:)  A cooking-pot that will not move<br>\
from its place, (M, K, TA,) by reason of its<br>\
greatness, (K, TA,) and that cannot be removed.<br>\
(M.) قُدُور رَاسِيَات in the Kur [xxxiv. 12] means,<br>\
accord. to Fr, (tropical:)  Cooking-pots that would not be<br>\
lowered from their place, by reason of their<br>\
greatness. (TA.)<br>\
مَرْسًى may be used as an inf. n., or a n. of<br>\
time, or a n. of place. (Bd in xi. 43 [cited above:<br>\
see 4].) [As a n. of place, it commonly means<br>\
An anchorage, or a place of anchoring; a port;<br>\
or a station for ships: pl. مَرَاس ٍ.]<br>\
مُرْسًى may be used as an inf. n., or a n. of time,<br>\
or a n. of place. (Bd in xi. 43 [cited above:<br>\
see 4].)<br>\

مِرْسَاةٌ, The anchor of a ship: (S, M, K:) or a<br>\

let down into the water, holds fast the ship, so<br>\
that she does not go on: (T, TA:) pl. مَرَاس ٍ.<br>\
(Har p. 111.) [Hence,] one says, أَلْقَوْا مَرَاسِيَهُمْ,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:) They remained, stayed, dwelt, or abode.<br>\
(TA.) And أَلْقَتِ السَّحَابَةُ مَرَاسِيَهَا (tropical:)  The cloud<br>\
rained continually; syn. دَامَت: (S, Msb:) or<br>\
remained steady, raining: (T, TA:) or remained<br>\
still, or stationary, and rained. (M, K: * in the<br>\
latter, السَّحَابُ is put in the place of السحابة.)<br>\
