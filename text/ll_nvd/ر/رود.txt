that I see thee coming and going, or going to and<br>\
fro, during this day?]. (A, TA.) And رَادَتْ,<br>\

meaning] (tropical:)  he was, or became, restless, (S, A,) by<br>\
reason of disease or anxiety: (A:) [or he was, or<br>\
became, sleepless: for] a poet uses the phrase<br>\
رَاذَ وِسَادُهَا as expressive of an imprecation, mean<br>\
ing (assumed tropical:)  May she be sleepless, so that her pillow may<br>\
not remain still. (TA.) [And راد خُرْتُ القَوْمِ and<br>\
رادت أَخْرَاتُهُمْ: see خُرْتٌ.]<br>\

↓ ارتاد, (Msb,) inf. n. اِرْتِيَادٌ; (K;) and ↓ استراد;<br>\
(TA;) He sought, sought after, or desired; or<br>\
he sought, or desired, to find and take, or to get;<br>\
(Msb, K;) a thing. (Msb.) [It seems to imply<br>\
the going to and fro in seeking.] You say, راد<br>\
الكَلَأَ, (S, A, Mgh, L,) and المَآءَ, (Mgh,) aor. يَرُودُ,<br>\
(S, A, Mgh, L,) inf. n. رِيَادٌ and رَوْدٌ: (S, L;) and<br>\

3<br>\
راودهُ He endeavoured to turn him [to, or<br>\
from, a thing]; as in the phrase راودهُ عَلَى الإِسْلَامِ<br>\
He endeavoured to turn him, or convert him, to<br>\
El-Islám; occurring in a trad., in which the<br>\
agent of the verb is Mohammad, and the object is<br>\
his uncle Aboo-Tálib;. syn. رَاجَعَهُ and رَادَّهُ: (L:)<br>\

signifies I desired, (S, Msb, K, *) or sought, (Msb,)<br>\
of him that he should do such a thing, or the<br>\
thing; (S, * Msb;) المُرَاوَدَةُ implying contention<br>\
(المُخَاصَمَة), because he who desires, or seeks,<br>\
affects gentle, or bland, behaviour, like him who<br>\
deceives, or beguiles, and, like him, strives, or<br>\
labours, to attain his object: (Msb:) and [hence,]<br>\
راودهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ, and عَلَيْهِ, He endeavoured to turn<br>\
him by blandishment, or by deceitful arts, or to<br>\
entice him to turn, from the thing, and to it;<br>\
syn. دَارَاهُ, (M, L,) or رَادَاهُ. (TT, as from the M.)<br>\
سَنُرَاوِدُ عَنْهُ أَبَاهُ, in the Kur xii. 61, means [We<br>\
will endeavour to turn his father from him, by<br>\
blandishment, or artifice, and to make him yield<br>\
him to us: or] we will strive, or labour, to obtain<br>\
him of his father. (Bd, Jel.) And رَاوَدَتْهُ عَنْ<br>\
نَفْسِهِ [in the Kur xii. 23] (assumed tropical:)  She desired, or sought,<br>\
of him, copulation, or his lying with her, using<br>\
blandishment, or artifice, for that purpose; she<br>\
tempted him to lie with her: (T, and Bd in<br>\
xii. 23:) [more literally, she endeavoured to turn<br>\
him, or entice him, by blandishment, or deceitful<br>\
arts, from his disdain, or disdainful incompliance,<br>\
and to make him yield himself to her:] and<br>\
رَاوَدَهَا عَنْ نَفْسِهَا (assumed tropical:)  he desired, or sought, of her,<br>\
copulation, &amp;c. (T.) And رَاوَدَهُ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ (tropical:)  He<br>\
endeavoured to deceive him, or beguile him, and<br>\
to turn him [from his disdain, or purpose, or<br>\
will,] by blandishment, or artifice. (A.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَرْوَدَ, (S, A, K,) inf. n. إِرْوَادٌ and مُرْوَدٌ and<br>\
[quasi-inf. n.] ↓ مَرْوَدٌ (S, K) and ↓ رُوَيْدٌ (TA as<br>\
from the K [but omitted in my MS. copy of the<br>\
K and in the CK]) and ↓ رُوَيْدَآءُ and ↓ رُوَيْدِيَةٌ or<br>\
↓ رُوَيْدِيَّةٌ, (accord. to different copies of the K,)<br>\
He acted, or proceeded, gently, softly, or in a<br>\
leisurely manner, (S, A, K, TA,) in going, or<br>\
pace. (S, A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  أَرْوَدَهُ, (S,) inf. n. إِرْوَادٌ, (M,)<br>\
He acted gently, softly, or in a leisurely manner,<br>\
towards, or with, him; or granted him a delay,<br>\
or respite; let him alone, or left him, for a while;<br>\
syn. أَمْهَلَهُ. (S, M. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَرَدْتُ الدَّوَابَّ: see 1, last<br>\
sentence.<br>\
-A3-  أَرَادَهُ, (M, L, Msb,) inf. n. إِرَادَةٌ, (S,<br>\
M, L, Msb, K,) originally with و, [i. e. أَرْوَدَهُ,]<br>\
because you say رَاوَدَهُ (S, L) in a similar sense,<br>\
(L,) He willed, wished, or desired, it: (S, * M, L,<br>\
K: *) he loved, or liked, it; and cared for, or<br>\
minded, it; or was rendered thoughtful, careful,<br>\
or anxious, by it: (M, L:) or he desired it;<br>\
sought it, or sought after it; (طَلَبَهُ;) and chose<br>\
it: (Msb:) [or] it differs from طَلَبَهُ, inasmuch<br>\
as إِرَادَةٌ is sometimes merely conceived in the<br>\
mind, not apparent; whereas طَلَبٌ is never other<br>\
wise than apparent, either by act or by word:<br>\
(Aboo-&#39;Obeyd El-Bekree, TA:) Th says that it<br>\
sometimes denotes loving, or liking, and some<br>\
times it does not [as will be shown by what<br>\
follows]: and Lh mentions the saying هَرْدتُ<br>\
الشَّىْءَ, aor. أُهَرِيدُهُ, inf. n. هِرَادَةٌ, with ه substi<br>\
tuted for ء [as in هَرَقْتُ for أَرَقْتُ, &amp;c.]. (M.)<br>\
You say, أَرَدْتُ مِنْهُ كَذَا [I desired, of him, such<br>\
a thing]. (A.) And مَا أَرَدْتُ إِلَّا مَا فَعَلْتَ [I<br>\
desired not aught save what thou didst, or hast<br>\
done]. (A.) [And اراد بِهِ كَذَا He desired to do<br>\
to him, or he intended him, such a thing;<br>\
whether good or evil: see Kur xxxiii. 17, &amp;c.]<br>\
And Kutheiyir says,<br>\
أُرِيدُ لِأَنْسَى ذِكْرَهَا فَكَأَنَّمَا<br>\
تُمَثَّلُ لِى لَيْلَى بِكُلِّ سَبِيلِ<br>\
[I desire to forget the remembrance of her, or<br>\
the mention of her; but it seems as though Leylà<br>\
were imaged to me in every road]; meaning<br>\
أُرِيدُ أَنْ أَنْسَى. (M.) [And ISd says,] I think<br>\
that Sb has mentioned the phrase أَرَادَنِى بِهٰذَالِكَ,<br>\
i. e. He intended, or meant, me by that. (M.)<br>\
[اراد often signifies He intended, or meant, such<br>\
a thing by a saying or an action.] فَوَجَدَا فِيهَا<br>\
جِدَارًا يُرِيدُ أَنْ يَنْقَضَّ, in the Kur xviii. 78, means<br>\
(tropical:)  [And they found therein a wall] that was near,<br>\
or about, to fall down, (Bd, Jel,) or that was ready<br>\
to fall down; though الإِرَادَة is only from an<br>\
animate being, and not properly predicable of a<br>\
wall: and there are many similar instances; as<br>\
the saying of a poet,<br>\
يُرِيدُ الرُّمْحُ صَدْرَ أَبِى بَرَآءٍ<br>\
وَ يَعْدِلُ عَنْ رِمَآءِ بَنِى عُقَيْلِ<br>\
[The spear is ready to pierce the breast of Aboo<br>\
Barà, but it turns away from the bloods of the<br>\
sons of &#39;Okeyl]. (M.) [In like manner also] one<br>\
says, اراد البُكَآءَ (assumed tropical:)  [He was about, or ready, to<br>\
weep: a phrase of frequent occurrence; like<br>\
تَهَيَّأَ لِلْبُكَآءِ, and هَمَّ بِالْبُكَآءِ]. (TA in art. جهش, &amp;c.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  You say also, ارادهُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ, (M,) or على<br>\
الأَمْرِ, (A, Mgh,) He endeavoured to induce him,<br>\
(M,) or he incited him, or made him, (A, Mgh,)<br>\
to do the thing. (M, A, Mgh.) And ارادهُ عَلَى<br>\
أَنْ يَكْتُبَ He incited him, or made him, to write.<br>\
(Mgh.) And ارادهُ إِلَى الكَلَامِ He constrained, or<br>\
necessitated, him to speak. (M, * TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تروّد He trembled, or quaked, by reason of<br>\
extreme softness, or tenderness, and fatness. (KL.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِرْتَوَدَ see 1, in four places.<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَرْوَدَ see 1, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  استراد لِأَمْرِ اللّٰهِ<br>\
occurs in a trad. as meaning He returned, and<br>\
became gentle and submissive to the command of<br>\
God. (TA.)<br>\
رَادٌ: see رَائِدٌ, with which it is syn. (S, M, K.)<br>\
رَادَةٌ [is its fem.: and] is a pl. of رَائِدٌ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
اِمْرَأَةٌ رَادَةٌ A woman who goes about to and from<br>\
the tents, or houses, of her female neighbours;<br>\
(AZ, As, S, M, A, K;) as also رَادٌ (TA) and<br>\
↓ رَوَادٌ (S M) and ↓ رَؤُودٌ (Aboo-&#39; Alee, M) and<br>\
↓ رُوَادَةٌ, like ثُمَامَة, and ↓ رَائِدَةٌ. (K.) You say<br>\
اِمْرَأْةٌ رَأْدَةٌ غَيْرُ رَادَةٍ A soft, or tender, woman; not<br>\
one that roves about: in which the former رادة<br>\
may be without ء, and the latter must be so.<br>\
(A and TA in art. رأد.) [See رُؤْدٌ; where it is<br>\
stated that رَادٌ and رَادَةٌ and ↓ رُودَةٌ, as epithets<br>\
applied to a girl or woman, are syn., one with<br>\
another, meaning Soft, or tender, &amp;c., like رَأْدٌ<br>\
and رَأْدَةٌ and رُؤْدَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  رِيحٌ رَادَةٌ A wind blowing<br>\
violently to and fro: (TA:) [and ↓ رِيحٌ رَائِدَةٌ<br>\
signifies the same; or wind in motion, or in a<br>\
state of commotion.; or veering about: see 1.]<br>\
[And] A wind blowing gently; (A;) and so ↓ رَوْدٌ<br>\
and ↓ رَائِدَةٌ (K) and ↓ رَوَادٌ. (TA. [See also art.<br>\
ريد.])<br>\
رَوْدٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
رُودٌ Gentleness; or a leisurely manner of acting<br>\
or proceeding. (S, M, A, K.) [And accord. to<br>\
the TT, as from the M, so رُؤْدٌ; but this is a mistranscription, for رُؤْدٌ: see this last, in art. رأد.]<br>\
You say, يَمْشِى عَلَى رُودٍ He walks, or goes,<br>\
gently, softly, or in a leisurely manner. (S, A,<br>\
K.) And its dim. is ↓ رُوَيْدٌ. (S, A, K. [But see<br>\
what follows.]) They said ↓ رُوَيْدًا, meaning<br>\
Gently, softly, or in a leisurely manner; (T, S,<br>\
M, A, K;) with tenween: (T:) and ↓ اِمْشِ رُوَيْدًا<br>\
Walk thou, or go thou, gently, &amp;c.: (T, A:) so<br>\
accord. to the lexicologists [in general]: but<br>\
accord. to Sb, it is a verbal n.: [for] they said,<br>\
زَيْدًا ↓ رُوَيْدَ, meaning Act thou gently, softly, or<br>\
in a leisurely manner, towards, or with, Zeyd;<br>\
or grant him a delay, or respite; let him alone,<br>\
or leave him, for a while; syn. أَمْهِلْهُ: hence it<br>\
has no dual nor pl. nor fem. form: and hence<br>\
they say that it is for إِرْوَادًا, in the sense of أَرْوِدْ;<br>\
as though it were an abbreviated dim., formed by<br>\
the rejection of the augmentative letters: this is<br>\
the opinion of Sb; for he holds it to be a substitute for أَرْوِدْ; though it has a nearer resemblance to إِرْوَادٌ because it is a noun: others hold<br>\
it to be the dim. of رُودٌ, and cite the saying [of a<br>\
poet],<br>\
كَأَنَّهُ مِثْلُ مَنْ يَمْشِى عَلَى رُودِ<br>\
[As though he were like him who walks, or goes,<br>\
gently, &amp;c.]: but this is a mistake; for رُودٌ is not<br>\
put in the place of a verb, as إِرْوَادٌ is. (M.)<br>\
Accord. to Ibn-Keysán, ↓ رُوَيْد seems to have<br>\
two contr. significations; for they said, رُوَيْدَ زَيْدًا,<br>\
meaning Leave thou Zeyd, or let him alone; and<br>\
also meaning act thou gently towards, or with,<br>\
Zeyd, and retain him, or withhold him. (TA.)<br>\
One says also, عَمْرًا ↓ رُوَيْدَكَ, meaning Act thou<br>\
gently, &amp;c., towards, or with, &#39;Amr; syn. أَمْهِلْهُ:<br>\
(T, * S, M, * K:) the ك in this case being a denotative of allocution, (T, S, M,) and having no<br>\
place in the desinential syntax: (S, M: *) it is<br>\
added only when رويد is used in the sense of an<br>\
imperative; (T, S, K;) and to prevent confusion<br>\
of him who is meant to be addressed with him<br>\
who is not meant, because رويد applies to one<br>\
and to more than one and to the male and to the<br>\
female; though sometimes one says رويدك to a<br>\
person when one does not fear his being confounded with another, using the ك as a corroborative. (T.) In this case, ↓ رويد is an abbreviated dim. of إِرْوَاد, the inf. n. of أَرْوَدَ. (S.) In<br>\
like manner also one says, (K, TA,) to a male,<br>\
(TA,) ↓ رُوَيْدَكَنِى [Act thou gently, &amp;c., towards,<br>\
or with, me]; and to a female, ↓ رُوَيْدَكِنِى; and<br>\
↓ رُوَيْدَكُمَانِى (K, TA) to two persons; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ رُوَيْدَكُمُونِى (K, TA) to males more than<br>\
two; (TA;) and ↓ رُوَيْدَكُنَّنِى (K, TA) to females more than two. (TA.) ↓ رُوَيْد is used in<br>\
four different manners: first, as a verbal n.; as<br>\
in عَمْرًا ↓ رُوَيْدَ, (S, K, *) i. e. أَرْوِدْ عَمْرًا, (S,) meaning أَمْهِلْهُ [expl. above]: (S, K:) secondly, as an<br>\
inf. n.; as in عَمْرٍو ↓ رُوَيْدَ [virtually meaning the<br>\
same]; the former word being prefixed to the<br>\
latter, governing it in the gen. case; (S, M, * K; *)<br>\
like فَضَرْبَ الرِّقَابِ, in the Kur [xlvii. 4], (S, M, *) in<br>\
which the inf. n. is put for its verb; (Jel;) and<br>\
like عَذِيرَ الحَىِّ [expl. in art. عذر]: (M:) thirdly,<br>\
as an epithet; as in ↓ سَارُوا سَيْرًا رُوَيْدًا [They went,<br>\
or journeyed, at a gentle, or leisurely, rate of<br>\
going, or journeying]; (Sb, S, K;) and سَارُوا<br>\
↓ رُوَيْدًا, in which سَيْرًا is suppressed: (T:) fourthly,<br>\
as a denotative of state; as in ↓ سَارَ القَوْمُ رُوَيْدًا<br>\
[The people, or party, went, or journeyed, going,<br>\
or journeying, gently, or leisurely]; it being here<br>\
in connection with a determinate noun, and therefore a denotative of its state. (S, K.) When it is<br>\
used as a threat, it is with nasb, without tenween;<br>\
(Lth, T, M; *) as in the saying of a poet,<br>\
تَصَاهَلْ بِالْعِرَاقِ جِيَادُنَا ↓ رُوَيْدَ<br>\
كَأَنَّكَ بِالضَّحَّاكِ قَدْ قَامَ نَادِبُهْ<br>\
[Act thou, or proceed thou, gently, lest our coursers<br>\
neigh, one to another, in El-&#39;Irák: it is as<br>\
though thou wert with Ed-Dahhák, his summoner to battle having already risen]. (Lth, T.)<br>\
Sb mentions his having heard the saying, وَاللّٰهِ<br>\
مَا الشِّعْرَ ↓ لَوْ أَرَدْتَ الدَّرَاهِمَ لَأَعْطَيْتُكَ رُوَيْدَ [By<br>\
God, hadst thou desired the money, I had given<br>\
thee: let alone the poetry: ما being here redundant]:<br>\
(T, M:) like the phrase, فَدَعِ الشِّعْرَ: (M:) and<br>\
similar to this is the saying, الشِّعْرَ يَغِبَّ ↓ رُوَيْدَ<br>\
[explained in art. غب]. (T.)<br>\
رِيدٌ [originally رِوْدٌ] Will, wish, or desire; (K;)<br>\
and so ↓ رِيدَةٌ [originally رِوْدَةٌ]: (M, L:) or the<br>\
former signifies a thing that one wishes, or desires,<br>\
and strives to obtain: (T in art. ريد:) and the<br>\
latter, love, or liking, for a thing; and solicitude<br>\
respecting it: (M, L:) or the latter signifies a<br>\
kind, or manner, of wishing or desiring; as in the<br>\
saying, أَرَدْتُهُ بِكُلِّ رِيدَةِ [I wished it, or desired it,<br>\
with every kind, or manner, of wishing or desiring]. (M.)<br>\
رُودَةٌ: see رَادٌ.<br>\
رِيدَةٌ: see رِيدٌ.<br>\
رَوَادٌ: see رَادٌ, in two places.<br>\
الرِّيَادُ, originally an inf. n., and ذَبُّ الرِّيَادِ, The<br>\
wild bull; [a species of bovine antelope;] (M;)<br>\
called ذبّ الرياد because he goes to and fro, not<br>\
remaining in one place; (M in art. ذب;) or<br>\
because he pastures going to and fro; (T and S *<br>\
and M in that art.;) or because his females<br>\
pasture with him, going to and fro. (T in that<br>\
art.) Also, the latter, (tropical:)  A man who comes and<br>\
goes. (Kr, M and TA in art. ذب.) And (tropical:)  A man<br>\
who is in the habit of visiting women. (AA, T<br>\
and K in that art.)<br>\
رَؤُودٌ: see رَادٌ.<br>\
الرِّوَنْدُ الصِّينِىُّ, (K,) or الرِّيوَنْدُ الصِّينِىُّ, (L,)<br>\
[mentioned in this art. though the ن should be<br>\
regarded as radical, for] it is not genuine Arabic,<br>\
(L,) [China-rhubarb;] a well-known medicine;<br>\
(K;) a certain cool medicine, good for the liver:<br>\
(L:) the physicians add an ا to it, (K,) saying<br>\
رَاوَنْد: (TA:) there are four kinds thereof; the<br>\
best of which is the صِينِىّ; and inferior to this is<br>\
the خُرَاسَانِىّ, which is [commonly] known by the<br>\
appellation of رَاوَنْدُ الدَّوَابِّ, used by the veterinarians: it is a black [app. a mistake for red, or<br>\
yellow,] wood, of compound powers, but its predominant qualities are heat and dryness. (TA.)<br>\
رُوَيْدٌ: see 4, first sentence: and see also رُودٌ<br>\
throughout.<br>\
رُوَادَةٌ: see رَادٌ.<br>\
رُوَيْدَآءُ and رُوَيْدِيَةٌ or رُوَيْدِيَّةٌ: see 4, first sentence.<br>\
رَائِدٌ [act. part. n. of 1, Coming and going;<br>\
moving to and fro; &amp;c.]. [Hence,] اِمْرَأَةٌ رَائِدَةٌ:<br>\
see رَادٌ. And دَوَابُّ رَوَائِدُ [pl. of دَابَّةٌ رَائِدَةٌ]<br>\
Beasts pasturing at pleasure: (T:) or going to<br>\
and for [in the place of pasture]: or pasturing<br>\
together while the rest are debarred from the<br>\
pasture, or tied. (M.) And رِيحٌ رَائِدَةٌ: see رَادٌ,<br>\
last two sentences. And رَائِدُ الوِسَادِ [lit. Whose<br>\
pillow moves to and fro; meaning] (tropical:)  a man restless by reason of disease or anxiety; (A;) or<br>\
uneasy on his pillow by reason of anxiety that<br>\
disquiets him: (TA:) [or sleepless: see 1.] And<br>\
