رَمَّهُ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَرُمُّ (T, S,<br>\
M, Msb, K) and يَرِمُّ (S, Msb, K,) the latter<br>\
[irreg. as aor. of a trans. v. of this class, and]<br>\
said by MF to be unknown, but there are other<br>\
instances of the same kind, as هَرَّهُ, aor. يَهُرُّ and<br>\
يَهِرُّ and عَلَّهُ, aor. يَعُلُّ and يَعِلُّ, (TA,) inf. n. رَمٌّ<br>\
(Lth, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and مَرَمَّةٌ, (Lth,<br>\
T, S, Mgh, K,) He repaired it; or put it into a<br>\
good, sound, right, or proper, state; (Lth, T, S,<br>\
M, Mgh, Msb, K;) after a part thereof had<br>\
become in a bad state; (Lth, T;) namely, a thing,<br>\
(Lth, T, S,) as, for instance, a rope becoming old<br>\
and worn-out, or a house, (Lth, T,) or a building,<br>\
(Mgh,) or a wall, &amp;c.; (Msb;) as also رَمَّ شَأْنَهُ,<br>\
(S,) or شَأْنَهَا referring to a house (دَار): (Lth, T:)<br>\
and in like manner, he rectified it, namely, an<br>\
affair, after it had become disorganized, or disordered: (Lth, T:) and ↓ رمّم signifies the same<br>\
in an intensive sense; [i. e. he repaired it, &amp;c.,<br>\
much, or well:] (Msb:) and ↓ رَمْرَمَ he repaired,<br>\
or rectified, his affair, case, state, or condition.<br>\
(TA.) The saying, كُنَّا أَهْلَ ثَمِّهِ وَرَمِّهِ, (T, S,)<br>\
occurring in a trad., (S,) accord. to the relaters<br>\
thereof ↓ ثُمِّهِ وَرُمِّهِ, but A&#39;Obeyd holds the former<br>\
reading to be the right, (T, S,) means, accord. to<br>\
AA, We were the fit persons to put it into a<br>\
good, sound, right, or proper, state: (T:) or,<br>\
accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, to put it into such a state,<br>\
and to eat it. (T, S. [See another explanation<br>\
of the verb in what follows.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also,<br>\
رَمَّ سَهْمَهُ, meaning (tropical:)  [He made his arrow even, or<br>\
straight, by means of his eye; or] he looked at his<br>\
arrow until he made it even, or straight. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  رَمٌّ also signifies The act of eating; and so<br>\
↓ اِرْتِمَامٌ. (ISh, T.) You say, رَمَّهُ, (T, S, K,) aor.<br>\
يَرُمُّ (T, S,) inf. n. رَمٌّ, (TA,) He ate it. (T, S,<br>\
K.) And it is said in a trad., عَلَيْكُمْ بِأَلْبَانِ البَقَرِ<br>\
فَإِنَّهَا تَرُمُّ مِنْ كُلِّ الشَّجَرِ [Keep ye to the milk of<br>\
cows, for they eat of all the tress]; (T, S, * TA;)<br>\
i. e. تَأْكُلُ: or, accord. to one reading, it is ↓ تَرْتَمُّ.<br>\
(TA.) رَمَّتِ الشَّاةُ الحَشِيشَ aor. تَرُمُّ, inf. n. رَمٌّ,<br>\
means The sheep, or goat, took the dry herbage,<br>\
or fodder, with its lips. (M.) And رَمَّتِ الشَّاةُ<br>\
مِنَ الأَرْضِ, and ↓ ارتمّت, The sheep, or goat, ate<br>\
from the land. (S.) And رَمَّتِ البَهْمَةُ, (M,) or<br>\
البَهِيمَةُ, (K,) inf. n. as above; (TA;) and ↓ ارتمّت;<br>\
i. e. [The lamb, or kid, or the beast, or quadruped,] reached and took the branches (M, K)<br>\
with its mouth. (K.) And كُلَّ رُمَامٍ ↓ هُوَ يَتَرَمَّمُ<br>\
He eats every [kind of] رُمَام [q. v.]. (T.) And<br>\
العَظْمَ ↓ ترمّم He ate off the flesh from the bone;<br>\
syn. تَعَرَّقَهُ: or he left the bone like the رِمَّة<br>\
[q. v.]: in [some of] the copies of the K, تَرَمَّمَ is<br>\
erroneously explained by تَعَزَّقَ; [in my MS. copy,<br>\
by تَعَرَّفَ; and in the CK, by تَفَرَّقَ;] the right<br>\
reading being تَعَرَّقَ, as in the A. (TA.) And<br>\
it is said in a trad., respecting the she-cat, وَلَا<br>\
مِنْ خَشَاشِ الأَرْضِ ↓ أَرْسَلْتُهَا تُرَمْرِمُ, meaning [And<br>\
I did not send her] for her to eat [of the creeping<br>\
things of the earth]. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  رَمَّ العَظْمُ, aor. يَرِمُّ<br>\
(T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. رَمٌّ (T, M,) or<br>\
رِمَّةٌ, (S,) or both, (K, TA, [the former written in<br>\
the CK رِمّ]) and رَمِيمٌ; (M, K;) and ↓ ارمّ; (M,<br>\
K; [but see what follows;]) The bone became<br>\
such as is termed رمَّة; (M, TA;) [i. e.,] became<br>\
old and decayed; (MA, KL;) syn. بَلِىَ. (T, S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K.) Accord. to IAar, one says,<br>\
رَمَّتْ عِظَامُهُ, and ↓ أَرَمَّتْ, meaning His bones<br>\
became old and decayed; syn. بَلِيَتْ: but others<br>\
explain العَظْمُ ↓ ارمّ differently, as below: see 4.<br>\
(T.) In the saying, mentioned in a trad., يَا<br>\
↓ رَسُولَ اللّٰهِ كَيْفَ تُعْرْضُ صَلَاتُنَا عَلَيْكَ وَقَدْ أَرَمْتَ,<br>\
meaning بَلِيتَ [i. e. O Apostle of God, how shall<br>\
our blessing be offered, or addressed, to thee<br>\
when thou shalt have become decayed in the<br>\
grave?], the last word is originally أَرْمَمْتَ; one<br>\
of the two م s being rejected; like as is done in<br>\
أَحَسْتَ, for أَحْسَسْتَ: (IAth, K, * TA: [in the<br>\
CK, تَعْرَضُ is put in the place of تُعْرَضُ:]) accord.<br>\
to one relation, it is أَرَمَّتَ; accord. to another,<br>\
رَمَمْتَ; and accord. to another, أُرِمْتَ: but the<br>\
first is the proper manner of relation. (TA.)<br>\
And رَمَّ الحَبْلُ The rope became [old and worn<br>\
out or rotten, (see رُمَّةٌ,) or] ragged, or dissundered. (M.)<br>\
2<br>\
رَمَّ3َ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
4<br>\
ارمّ, said of a bone, It had in it, or contained, رِمّ, i. e. marrow, (T, S, K,) running therein. (S.) One says of a sheep or goat (S, M)<br>\
that is lean, or emaciated, (S,) and of a she-camel, (M,) مَا يُرِمُّ مِنْهَا مَضْرِبٌ, (S, M,) meaning<br>\
Not a bone of her that is broken and from which<br>\
the marrow is [sought to be] extracted [contains<br>\
any marrow]: (M:) i. e., if any of her bones be<br>\
broken, no marrow will be found in it. (S.)<br>\
And ارمّت is said of a she-camel in the first stage<br>\
of fatness when becoming in good condition of<br>\
body, and in the last stage thereof when becoming<br>\
lean; (M, TA;) meaning She had in her somewhat of marrow. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, in the latter<br>\
part of the paragraph, in four places.<br>\
-A2-  Also,<br>\
(T, S, M, K,) inf. n. إِرْمَامٌ, (T,) He (a man, T)<br>\
was, or became, silent; (T, M, K;) in a general<br>\
sense; or, as some say, from fear, or fright:<br>\
(M:) [and in like manner a bird: see its part. n.<br>\
مُرِمٌّ:] or they (a company of men) were, or became, silent. (S.) [See also R. Q. 2.]<br>\
-A3-  ارمّ<br>\
إِلَى اللَّهْو He inclined to diversion, sport, or play.<br>\
(IAar, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And ارمّ لِكَذَا He was cheered,<br>\
or delighted, and pleased, or was diverted, by<br>\
reason of such a thing; like أَرَنَّ لَهُ. (T in art.<br>\
رن.)<br>\
5<br>\
ترمّمهُ He proceeded gradually, by degrees,<br>\
step by step, or time after time, with the repairing<br>\
of it; or with the putting it into a good, sound,<br>\
right, or proper, state. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1,<br>\
near the middle of the paragraph, in two places.<br>\
8<br>\
إِرْتَمَ3َ see 1, in the middle portion of the paragraph,<br>\
in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  ارتمّ is also said of a young<br>\
camel as meaning He began to be in that state in<br>\
which one could feel his hump. (K.)<br>\
10<br>\
استرمّ It (a wall, S, MA, Mgh, K, or a<br>\
building, KL) needed, or required, its being<br>\
repaired; (M, MA, K, KL; expl. in the M and<br>\
K by دَعَا إِلَى إِصْلَاحِهِ;) having become old:<br>\
(MA:) or attained to the time in which it should<br>\
be repaired; (S, Mgh;) a long period having<br>\
elapsed since it was plastered with mud. (S.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
رَمْرَمَ: see 1, in two places.<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَرَمْرَمَ He moved his lips, (T,) or his<br>\
mouth, (S,) to speak: (T, S:) or تَرَمْرَمُوا they put<br>\
themselves in motion to speak, but spake not:<br>\
(M, K:) but it is said to be mostly used in<br>\
negative phrases. (TA.) One says, مَا تَرَمْرَمَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
بِحَرْفٍ Such a one uttered not [a letter, or a<br>\
word]: (T, TA:) or put not himself in motion<br>\
[therewith]. (IDrd, TA.) And كَلَّمَهُ فَمَا تَرَمْرَمَ<br>\
[He spoke to him and] he returned not a reply.<br>\
(M, TA.)<br>\
رَمٌّ an inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (Lth, T, S, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
One says, مَالِى مِنْهُ حَمٌّ وَلَا رَمٌّ There is not for<br>\
me any avoiding it, or escaping it: (S:) or<br>\
مَا لَهُ عَنْ ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ حَمٌّ وَلَا رَمٌّ (T, TA) There is<br>\
not for him any avoiding, or escaping, that<br>\
thing, or affair: (TA:) and some say ↓ حُمٌّ وَلَا رُمٌّ:<br>\
(S:) so says Lth: (T:) [accord. to ISd,] in the<br>\
saying ↓ مَا عَنْ ذٰلِكَ حُمٌّ وَلَا رُمٌّ, meaning There is<br>\
no avoiding, or escaping, that, رُمٌّ is an imitative<br>\
sequent; (M;) and so says Lth. (T. [But see<br>\
the next paragraph.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also another signification assigned to رَمٌّ in the last sentence but<br>\
one of the next paragraph. ―<br>\
-b4-  [And see the last<br>\
sentence also of that paragraph.]<br>\
رُمٌّ: see 1, second sentence: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also the<br>\
paragraph next preceding this, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also i. q. بَيْتٍ ↓ مَرَمَّةُ, (ISk, T, S, M,) i. e.<br>\
Household-goods; or the utensils and furniture<br>\
of a house or tent. (M. [This explanation, from<br>\
the M, I have found, in the TT, since I composed<br>\
art. ثم; in which I have said that, accord. to<br>\
analogy, مَرَمَّةُ البَيْتِ app. signifies the means by<br>\
which a house, or tent, is put into a good state;<br>\
and therefore good furniture and utensils.]) So<br>\
in the saying, مَا لَهُ ثُمٌّ وَلَا رُمٌّ, (ISk, T, S, M,) and<br>\
مَا يَمْلِكُ ثُمًّا وَلَا رُمًّا, (ISk, T, S,) i. e. He has not,<br>\
and he possesses not, such household-goods as<br>\
water-skins, or milk-skins, and vessels, (ISk, T,<br>\
M,) nor any of the utensils and furniture of the<br>\
house or tent. (ISk, * T, * M.) This explanation<br>\
is better than the saying of Lth [that رُمٌّ is an<br>\
imitative sequent: see the next preceding paragraph]. (T.) One says also, مَا لَهُ حُمٌّ وَلَا رُمٌّ,<br>\
meaning He has not anything: (S:) or he has<br>\
neither little nor much. (TA voce حَمٌّ [q. v.])<br>\
[See also ثُمٌّ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  Also i. q. هَمٌّ [as meaning An<br>\
object, or a thing intended or meant or determined<br>\
upon or desired, in the mind: and perhaps also<br>\
anxiety; or disquietude, or trouble, of mind].<br>\
(M, K. [This signification, هَمٌّ, Freytag has<br>\
assigned to رَمٌّ, not to رُمٌّ; rendering it “ cura,<br>\
sollicitudo; ” as from the K; in which the word<br>\
bearing it is expressly said to be “ with damm. ”])<br>\
So in the saying, مَا لَهُ رُمٌّ غَيْرُ كَذَا [He has not<br>\
any object in his mind except such a thing]. (M.)<br>\
And so in the saying, مَا لَهُ حُمٌّ وَلَا رُمٌّ غَيْرُكَ and<br>\
↓ حَمٌّ وَلَا رَمٌّ [He has not any object in his mind<br>\
except thee]. (TA in art. حم.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A company of men: occurring in a trad. applied to a<br>\
company of [the people called] أَكْرَاد, abiding [in<br>\
a place] like a حَى [or tribe] of the Arabs of the<br>\
desert: [perhaps correctly رَمٌّ, from the Pers. رَمْ:]<br>\
said by Aboo-Moosà to be app. a Pers. word.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رِمٌّ The herbage and other things that are upon<br>\
the land: whence the current saying, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
بِالطِّمِّ وَالرِّمِّ, meaning Such a one brought everything of what is on the land and in the sea: [or,<br>\
of what is in the sea and on the land; for] الطِّمُّ<br>\
means “ the sea; ” and is originally الطّمُّ, but is<br>\
pronounced [in this case] الطِّمّ to assimilate it to<br>\
الرِّمّ. (T.) [Or] i. q. ثَرًى [app. as meaning<br>\
Good of any kind; and particularly wealth;<br>\
as appears from what immediately follows]: one<br>\
says, جَآءَهُ بِالطِّمِّ وَالرِّمّ, meaning He brought him<br>\
much wealth. (S.) [Or] جَآءَ بِالطِّمِّ وَالرِّمِّ means<br>\
He brought what was of the sea and what was of<br>\
the land: (بِالبَحْرِىِّ وَالبَرِّىّ, K: [so in MS. copies<br>\
and in the CK: in the copy of the K followed in<br>\
the TA, and in like manner in the M, بالبحر<br>\
والثرى, which, I think, is evidently a false<br>\
reading:]) or moist and dry: or earth and water:<br>\
(M, K:) or much wealth; (K;) as in the S:<br>\
(TA:) and it is said in the copies of the K, [and<br>\
in the M,] that الرِّمُّ signifies what is borne [on<br>\
its surface] by the water; but this is a signification of الطِّمُّ; and الرِّمُّ signifies what is borne by<br>\
the wind: (TA:) or what is upon the ground, of<br>\
fragments of dry herbage. (M, K.) [See also<br>\
art. طم.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Marrow. (T, S, M, K.)<br>\
رُمَّةٌ The remains of a rope after it has become<br>\
ragged, or dissundered: (T:) or a piece of a rope<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K) that is old and worn out or<br>\
rotten; (S;) as also ↓ رِمَّةٌ: (M, K:) pl. [of mult.]<br>\
رُمَمٌ (T, S,) or رِمَمٌ (M, K,) and رِمَامٌ (S, M,<br>\
K) and [of pauc.] أَرْمَامٌ: (M, K:) and they said<br>\
also حَبْلٌ أَرْمَامٌ and رِمَمٌ [or رُمَمٌ] and رِمَامٌ; (M,<br>\
K;) [like حَبْلٌ أَرْمَاثٌ and ثَوْبٌ أَخْلَاقٌ &amp;c.;] thus<br>\
using the pl. as though every part [of the rope]<br>\
were termed a single thing. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the<br>\
saying, أَعْطَيْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ بِرُمَّتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  I gave him the thing<br>\
altogether: (T:) or دَفَعَ إِلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ بِرُمَّتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
gave him the thing altogether: (S:) or أَخَذَهُ بِرُمَّتِهِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He took it altogether: (M; and the like is said<br>\
in the Msb:) and أَتَيْتُكَ بِالشَّىْءِ بِرُمّتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  I brought<br>\
thee, or have brought thee, the thing altogether:<br>\
(M:) or أَعْطَاهُ بِرُمَّتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He gave it altogether:<br>\
(K:) originally meaning the rope that is put<br>\
upon the neck of the camel: (T:) [i. e.] originating from the fact that a man gave to another a<br>\
camel with a rope upon his neck: (S, K:) or<br>\
from the fact that a man sold a camel with a<br>\
rope upon his neck; and it was said, Give him<br>\
with his رُمَّة: (Msb:) or, as some say, from the<br>\
bringing a captive bound with his رُمَّة; but this<br>\
is not a valid assertion. (M.) In all the copies<br>\
of the K, الرُّمَّةُ is also expl. as syn. with الجَبْهَةُ;<br>\
but [SM says,] I have not found it in the originals from which it is derived; and may-be the<br>\
right reading is الجُمْلَةُ. (TA.) &#39;Alee said, dispraising the present world, أَسْبَابُهَا رِمَامٌ, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Its ties (lit. ropes) are] old and worn out or<br>\
rotten. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ↓ أَرْمَامٌ [perhaps as pl. of رُمَّةٌ]<br>\
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The last remains of herbage. (M,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
رِمَّةٌ Old and decayed bones: (AA, T, S, M,<br>\
Msb, K:) or the old and decayed, of bones:<br>\
(Mgh:) pl. رِمَمٌ and رِمَامٌ. (S, Msb.) The performance of the act termed الاِسْتِنْجَآء therewith is<br>\
forbidden. (Mgh, TA.) [See also رَمِيمٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [And<br>\
A bone in which is marrow. (Freytag, from the<br>\
“ Kitáb el-Addád. ”)] ―<br>\
-b3-  See also رُمَّةٌ, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-  Also A two-winged ant: (M, K:) so<br>\
accord. to Aboo-Hátim; but disallowed by ElBekree. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The أَرَضَة [or woodfretter], (M, K,) in some one or more of the<br>\
dialects. (M, TA.)<br>\
رُمُمٌ Clever, ingenious, skilful, or intelligent,<br>\
girls, or young women: (IAar, K:) app. pl. of<br>\
↓ رَامَّةٌ, [as it is said to be in the TK, whence<br>\
Freytag (who has mentioned it as from the K,<br>\
explaining it as an epithet applied to a girl meaning “ ingeniosa, prudens,”) appears to have taken<br>\
it,] which signifies a female skilful in repairing.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رُمَامٌ: see رَمِيمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is applied as an epithet to<br>\
ثُمَام, in a saying of &#39;Omar, explained in art. ثم:<br>\
accord. to some, it means that whereof the heads<br>\
are grown, so that they are eaten (تُرَمُّ, i. e.<br>\
تُؤْكَلُ): it is also applied to a herb, or leguminous<br>\
plant, such that the cattle pluck it with their<br>\
mouths, obtaining but little thereof: and to herbage that had dried up when becoming green. (T.)<br>\
شِاْةٌ رَمُومٌ A sheep, or goat, that eats that by<br>\
which it passes. (M, TA.)<br>\
رَمِيمٌ A bone old and decayed: (S, M, Msb, K:)<br>\
and ↓ رُمَامٌ signifies the same (K, TA) in an intensive sense: (TA:) or the former is like رِمَّةٌ;<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, T, and Ksh in xxxvi. 78;) i. e. it is<br>\
a subst., signifying the old and decayed, of bones;<br>\
(Ksh and Bd ibid.;) not of the measure فَعِيلٌ in<br>\
the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ or مَفْعُولٌ: (Ksh<br>\
ibid.:) or it is used in the sense of the measure<br>\
مَفْعُولٌ, [meaning eroded,] from رَمَمْتُهُ [“ I ate<br>\
it ”]: (Bd ibid.:) its pl. is in most instances أَرِمَّآءُ<br>\
[when it is used as a subst. or as an epithet], like<br>\
أَدِلَّآءُ pl. of دَلِيلٌ [or أَقْرِبَآء pl. of قَرِيبٌ]; and رِمَامٌ<br>\
also occurs [when it is used as a subst., for رِمَّةٌ,<br>\
of which رِمَامٌ is a pl., or when it is used as an<br>\
epithet], like كِرَامٌ pl. of كَرِيمٌ: (Msb:) or you<br>\
say أَعْظُمٌ رَمَائِمُ, and رَمِيمٌ also; or رَمِيمٌ may have<br>\
the meaning of a gen. n., and therefore be used<br>\
in the place of a pl. (M.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
ubi suprà, مَنْ يُحْيِى الْعِظَامَ وَهِىَ رَمِيمٌ [Who will<br>\
quicken the bones when they are old and decayed<br>\
&amp;c.?]; the last word being without ة because it is<br>\
a subst., as expl. above, (Ksh, Bd, Jel,) not an<br>\
epithet; (Ksh, Jel;) or because it is used in the<br>\
sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, as stated above;<br>\
(Bd;) or because words of the measures فَعِيلٌ<br>\
and فَعُولٌ are sometimes used alike as masc. and<br>\
fem. [and sing.] and pl., like صَدِيقٌ and رَسُولٌ<br>\
and عَدُوٌّ. (S.) And Hátim, or some other, says,<br>\
أَمَا وَالَّذِى لَا يَعْلَمُ السِّرَّ غَيْرُهُ<br>\
وَيُحْيِى العِظَامَ البِيضَ وَهْىَ رَمِيمُ<br>\
[Verily, or now surely, by Him beside whom none<br>\
knoweth the secret, and who quickeneth the white<br>\
bones when they are old and decayed &amp;c.]; in<br>\
which رميم may have the meaning of a gen. n.,<br>\
as observed above. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  Anything old and decayed or worn out. (M.) One<br>\
says, أَحْيَى رَمِيمَ المَكَارِمِ (tropical:)  [He revived what had<br>\
become decayed of generous qualities or actions or<br>\
practices]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  The remains of the<br>\
herbage of the next preceding year: (Lh, M:)<br>\
from the same word in the sense first expl. above.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
-A2-  رَمِيمُ is one of the names of The east, or<br>\
easterly, wind; الصَّبَا: and is also a proper name<br>\
for a woman. (M.)<br>\
رُمَامَةٌ A sufficiency of the means of subsistence,<br>\
(K, TA,) whereby life becomes, or is held to be,<br>\
in a good, or thriving, state. (TA.)<br>\
رَمَّآءُ, applied to a ewe, White, (S, M,) without<br>\
any colour upon her. (M.)<br>\
رَمَّامٌ قَشَّاشٌ One who collects what has fallen<br>\
of food, and the worst thereof, to eat it, not preserving himself from its uncleanness. (T, as heard<br>\
by its author from the Arabs.)<br>\
رُمَّانٌ is of the measure فُعْلَانٌ accord. to Sb:<br>\
accord. to Abu-l-Hasan [i. e. Akh], of the measure<br>\
فُعَّالٌ, (M, TA,) and is [therefore] mentioned in<br>\
the S and K in art. رمن [q. v.]: (TA:) the n. un.<br>\
is with ة. (M.)<br>\
رَمْرَامٌ The حَشِيش [or herbs, or dry herbage,] of<br>\
the [season called] رَبِيع: and also a certain species<br>\
of trees, (S, M,) of sweet scent: n. un. with ة:<br>\
(M:) or رَمْرَامَةٌ signifies a certain well-known<br>\
sort of حَشِيش in the desert; and رَمْرَامٌ, much<br>\
thereof: (T:) or this latter signifies a certain<br>\
herb having prickly branches and leaves, that forbid the touch, rising to the height of a cubit; long<br>\
in the leaves, broad, and intensely green, having<br>\
