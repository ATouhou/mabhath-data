meaning His running is attended with difficulty,<br>\
and the accomplishment of his affair is hindered]:<br>\
(T: [in a copy of the A, as cited in the TA,<br>\
حِزْبُهُ is put in the place of جَرْيُهُ, which appears<br>\
to be the right reading, from what here follows:])<br>\
and<br>\
جَرْىٌ كَرِيثٌ أَمْرُهُ رَبِيثُ<br>\

K:) or both signify deceit, or delusion; [in<br>\
which sense, accord, to the TA, the former word<br>\
is expl. in the K, but it is not so in my MS. copy<br>\
of the K nor in the CK;] and hindrance, restraint, or prevention: (M, TA:) pl. of the<br>\
former رَبَائِثُ. (TA.) You say, فَعَلَ ذٰلِكَ لَهُ رَبِيثَةً<br>\

they remind them of the wants that hinder, or<br>\
withhold, them [from the prayers of that day]:<br>\
(S:) or, as some relate it, ↓ يَرْمُونَ النَّاسَ بِالتَّرَابِيثِ,<br>\
which is said by El-Khattábee to be of no account;<br>\
but it may mean [they assail men with] hindrances; for تَرَابِيثُ may be pl. of ↓ تَرْبِيثَةٌ, inf. n.<br>\
un. of رَبَّثَهُ. (MF.)<br>\
