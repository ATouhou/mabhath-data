الأَمْرِ Verily I exalt thee [or hold thee] above this<br>\
thing, (S, Har ubi suprà, TA,) and do not approve<br>\
of it for thee: (Har, TA:) as though properly<br>\
signifying I betake myself with thee to an elevated place of observation, in honour of thee, and<br>\
in care, or solicitude, for thee, and preserve thee<br>\
and keep watch for thee as a scout and a watchman: (Har ubi suprà:) [this usage of the verb,<br>\
as is shown in the TA, is what is meant by its<br>\
being said that] رَبَأَ is also syn. with رَفَعَ. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  رَبَأَ المَالَ He preserved, guarded, or took<br>\
care of, (TA,) and put into a good, or right,<br>\

See also what next follows.<br>\
2<br>\
ربّأهُ, inf. n. تَرْبِئَةٌ, He made it to pass away;<br>\
(K, TA;) namely, property: so in the Tekmileh:<br>\
in the K, ↓ رَبَأَ is likewise mentioned, in an earlier<br>\
part of the art., as meaning أَذْهَبَ; but the context in the K compared with that in the Tekmileh<br>\
seems to show that this is a mistake. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
رابأ He watched, or observed, a thing;<br>\
(M, K; *) as also ↓ رَبَأَ and ↓ اربأ and ↓ ارتبأ: (TA:)<br>\
he guarded (حَارَسَ, T, M, K) men, (M,) or a<br>\
man, (T, K, *) being guarded by him. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
He was cautious of, or he feared, a thing, (T, *<br>\
S, K, *) or a man; (M;) inf. n. مُرَابَأَةٌ. (T, S.<br>\
[In one of my copies of the S, رَبَأْتُ الشَّىْءَ مَرْبَأَةً<br>\
is erroneously put for رَابَأْتُ الشىء مُرَابَأَةً.])<br>\
4<br>\
أَرْبَاَ see 1, in two places, near the beginning:<br>\
-A2-  and see also 3.<br>\
8<br>\
ارتبأ He stationed himself, or stood, upon a<br>\
place such as is called مَرْبَأٌ. (T.) See also 1, in<br>\
five places.<br>\
-A2-  And see 3.<br>\
رَبْأَةٌ, (K,) written by El-Munáwee رَبَأَةٌ, but it is<br>\
not certain, (TA,) The [kind of leathern vessel<br>\
for water called] إِدَاوَة that is made of four<br>\
skins; (K;) made of four skins because of its<br>\
largeness. (MF.)<br>\
رَبَآءٌ [High ground]. You say أَرْضٌ لَا رَبَآءَ فِيهَا<br>\
وَلَا وَطَآءَ, with medd in each case, [A land in<br>\
which is no high ground nor low ground.] (T.)<br>\
رَبِىْءٌ: see what next follows, in two places.<br>\
رَبِيْئةٌ (T, S, M, O, K) and ↓ رَبِىْءٌ (S, O) and<br>\
↓ مُرْتَبِىءٌ (T in art. رمى) A scout; (T, S, M, O,<br>\
K;) but only (O, TA) such as is stationed upon<br>\
a mountain or some elevated spot, (T, * O, TA,)<br>\
whence he looks out: (O, TA:) [perhaps also<br>\
signifying scouts; for the word طَلِيعَةٌ by which<br>\
the first is explained in the S and M and O and<br>\
K, and the second also in the S and O, means<br>\
“ a scout ” and “ scouts: ”] pl. [of the first]<br>\
رَبَايَا. (S, O.) The first is fem. because the<br>\
طليعة is also called عَيْنٌ, and عين is fem.: but<br>\
Sb states that this last word in the sense of طليعة<br>\
is masc. and fem.; fem. originally, and masc. as<br>\
being turned from [the signification of] a part<br>\
[i. e. an eye] to [that of] the whole [person].<br>\
(M.) AA cites, as an ex. of ↓ رَبِىْءٌ<br>\
فَأَرْسَلْنَا أَبَا عَمْرٍو رَبِيْئًا<br>\
[And we sent Aboo-&#39; Amr as a scout]: (TA:)<br>\
from a poem of &#39;Abd-Esh-Shárik El-Juhanee.<br>\
(Ham pp. 218 et seqq.)<br>\
رَابِىءُ الضُّرَبَآءِ [The superintendent, or supervisor,<br>\
of the players at the game called المَيْسِر, whose<br>\
place is behind them]. (TA in art. رقب.)<br>\
مَرْبَأٌ and ↓ مَرْبَأَةٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ مُرْتَبَأٌ (S, K)<br>\
and ↓ مِرةبَآءٌ (TA as from the K [but not in the CK<br>\
nor in my MS. copy of the K]) An elevated<br>\
place of observation, or upon which a person is<br>\
stationed to watch; (S, K;) the place of the رَبِيْئَة<br>\
[or scout]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, the first of these<br>\
words, (S,) or ↓ the second, (T, M,) The مَنَارَة<br>\
[or perch], (T,) or place, (S, M,) of the hawk,<br>\
or falcon, (T, S, M,) upon which he stands, (S,)<br>\
or upon which he mounts. (M.) A rájiz suppresses the ء, saying,<br>\
مُقَيَّدَا ↓ بَاتَ عَلَى مَرْبَاتِهِ<br>\
[He passed the night upon his perch, shackled].<br>\
(T.)<br>\
مَرْبَأَةٌ and مَرْبَاةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in three places.<br>\
مَرْبَآءٌ, (M, and so in copies of the K,) accord.<br>\
to IAar, with medd and fet-h, (M,) or ↓ مِرْبَآءٌ,<br>\
(M, and so in the K accord. to the TA,) the<br>\
latter preferred by Th, (M,) A stair, or ladder.<br>\

مُرْتَبَأٌ: see مَرْبَأٌ.<br>\
مُرْتَبِىءٌ: see رَبِيْئَةٌ.<br>\
