أَرْذَالٌ, (T, S, M, O, and so in some copies of the<br>\
K,) [or this is more probably pl. of ↓ رَذِيلٌ,<br>\
accord. to analogy,] and رُذُولٌ (S, M, K) and<br>\
رُذَالٌ, (M, K,) which is of a rare form, (M,) [in<br>\

only to rational beings,] and (of ↓ رَذِيلٌ, TA)<br>\
رُذَلَآءُ, (S, M, K,) and, of the pl. أَرْذُلٌ, (Msb,<br>\

in the place of أَرْذَالٌ,) and [of ↓ الأَرْذَلُ,] الأَرْذَلُونَ,<br>\

written without the ال in the K.] You say<br>\
رَجُلٌ رَذْلُ الثِّيَابِ and الفِعْلِ [A man mean, or<br>\
bad, &amp;c., in respect of clothes and of action].<br>\
(T, TA.) And ثَوْبٌ رَذْلٌ A dirty, bad, or vile,<br>\
garment; (TA;) and so ↓ ثوب رَذِيلٌ: (M, TA:)<br>\
or ↓ ثوب رَذِلٌ [so accord. to a copy of the T, but<br>\
perhaps a mistranscription for رَذْلٌ,] a dirty<br>\
garment: and ↓ ثوب رَذِيلٌ a bad, or vile, garment. (T.)<br>\
رَذِلٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
رُذَالٌ: see رَذْلٌ [of which it is both a syn. and a<br>\
pl.]. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S,) or ↓ رُذَالَةٌ, (T,) or both, (M,<br>\
Msb, K,) The worse or viler, or the worst or<br>\
vilest, (T,) or the bad, or vile, (S,) of anything:<br>\
(T, S:) [or the refuse thereof; i. e.] a thing of<br>\
which the good has been picked out, (M, Msb,<br>\
K,) and the bad or vile, (M,) or the worse or<br>\
viler, or worst or vilest, (Msb,) remains. (M,<br>\
Msb.) You say also, النَّاسِ ↓ هُمْ رُذَالَةُ and رُذَالُهُمْ<br>\
[They are the lower or baser &amp;c., or lowest or<br>\
basest &amp;c., or the refuse, of mankind, or of the<br>\
people]. (T.)<br>\
رَذِيلٌ: see رَذْلٌ, in five places.<br>\
رُذَالَةٌ: see رُذَالٌ, in two places.<br>\
رَذِيلَةٌ A low, base, vile, mean, contemptible, or<br>\
bad, quality; contr. of فَضِيلَةٌ; (M, K:) pl.<br>\
رَذَائِلُ. (TA.)<br>\
رُذَالَى: see the next paragraph.<br>\
أَرْذَلُ: see رَذْلٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The<br>\
worse, or worst: so in the phrase أَرْذَلُ العُمُرِ [The<br>\
worse, or worst, part of life]. (O, K.) [In the<br>\
K, immediately after the words وَأَرْذَلَ صَارَ أَصْحَابُهُ<br>\
رُذَلَآءَ, we find, in some copies, وَرُذَالَى كَحُبَارَى<br>\
وَأَرْذَلُ العُمُرِ أَسْوَؤْهُ; and in other copies, وَرُذَالَى<br>\
كَحُبَارَى أَرْذَلُ العُمُرِ أَسْوَؤُهُ: accord. to the former<br>\
reading, the meaning is, that ↓ رُذَالَى is syn. with<br>\
رُذَلَآءُ; and such SM holds to be the case: accord.<br>\
to the latter reading, that رُذَالَى is syn. with<br>\
أَرْذَلُ العُمُرِ. I have no doubt that the latter is the<br>\
original reading in the K, and that it is taken<br>\
from the O, where (with a preceding context<br>\
different from that in the K) the words are,<br>\
وَرُذَالَى اَرذَلِ العُمُرِ اَسْوَؤُهُ; thus, with ارذل in the<br>\
gen. case: but I believe, as this word thus written<br>\
suggests, and as some persons, alluded to by MF,<br>\
have supposed, that كحبارى has been foisted<br>\
into the text of the K in consequence of a misunderstanding or of a mistranscription of the words<br>\
in question in some work earlier than the O;<br>\
that the correct reading is, وَرُدَّ إِلَى أَرْذَلِ العُمُرِ<br>\
أَسْوَئِهِ; and that this is taken from what here<br>\
follows.] It is said in the Kur [xvi. 72 and<br>\
xxii. 5], وَمِنْكُمْ مَنْ يُرَدُّ إِلَى أَرْذَلِ العُمُرِ, (T, TA,)<br>\
i. e. [And of you is he who is brought back to]<br>\
the worse, or worst, [part] of life, (Ksh and Bd<br>\
and Jel,) and the more, or most, contemptible<br>\
thereof; (Ksh in xvi. 72;) a state of decrepitude<br>\
and dotage; (Ksh and Bd and Jel;) which resembles the state of a young infant: (Ksh and<br>\
Bd:) meaning he who dotes by reason of old<br>\
age, so that he has no intellect; as is shown<br>\
by the words in the same [immediately following],<br>\
لِكَيْلَا يَعْلَمَ بَعْدَ عِلْمٍ شَيْئًا or مِنْ بَعْدِ عِلْمٍ شَيْئًا.<br>\
(T, TA. *)<br>\
مَرْذُولٌ A man made, or pronounced, to be low,<br>\
base, vile, mean, or contemptible: (S, * TA:) and<br>\
a thing made, or pronounced, to be bad, corrupt,<br>\
vile, base, abominable, or disapproved. (TA.)<br>\
