رَحِمَهُ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
رَحَمَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
رَحْمَةٌ and رُحْمٌ [and رَحَمَةٌ and رُحُمٌ] and مَرْحَمَةٌ,<br>\
(S, * Msb, K, *) [He had mercy, or pity, or compassion, on him; or he treated him, or regarded<br>\
him, with mercy or pity or compassion; i. e.] he<br>\
was, or became, tender [or tender-hearted] towards<br>\
him; and inclined to favour him [and to benefit<br>\
him]: (S, Msb, K: [see also رَخِمَهُ and رَخَمَهُ:])<br>\
and he pardoned him, or forgave him: (K:) said<br>\
of a man: (S, Msb, K:) and also of God [in the<br>\
former sense, but tropically, or anthropopathically:<br>\
or as meaning He favoured him, or benefited him;<br>\
or pardoned, or forgave, him: see explanations<br>\
of رَحْمَةٌ below]: (Msb, K:) and عَلَيْهِ ↓ ترحّم signifies the same, (MA, [and the same seems to be<br>\
indicated in the S,]) said of a man: (S:) [and so<br>\
does ↓ ترحّمهُ, (occurring in the S and K in art.<br>\
رعى, &amp;c.,) accord. to Ibn-Maaroof, for he says<br>\
that] تَرَحُّمٌ signifies the regarding [another] with<br>\
mercy or pity or compassion; or pardoning [him],<br>\
or forgiving [him]: and also the being merciful<br>\
or pitiful or compassionate or favourably inclined<br>\
[عَلَى غَيْرِهِ to another]. (KL: but respecting this<br>\
latter verb, see 2.)<br>\
-A2-  رَحُمَتْ, and رَحِمَتْ, (S, K,)<br>\
and رُحِمَتْ, (K,) inf. n. رَحَامَةٌ, (S, K,) which is<br>\
of the first, (S, TA,) and رَحَمٌ, (S, K,) which is<br>\
of the second, (S, TA,) and رَحْمٌ, (K,) which is<br>\
of the third, (TA,) She had a complaint of her<br>\
womb after bringing forth, (S, K,) and died in<br>\
consequence thereof: (K:) said of a camel, (S,<br>\
TA,) and of a ewe or goat, and of a woman, and<br>\
of any animal having a womb: (TA:) or she had<br>\
a disease in her womb, in consequence of which<br>\
she did not receive impregnation: or she brought<br>\
forth without letting fall her secundine: (K,<br>\
TA:) or, accord. to Lh, the bringing forth without letting fall her secundine, by a sheep or goat,<br>\
is termed ↓ رُحَامٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَحِمَ, aor.<br>\
رَحَمَ, inf. n.<br>\
رَحَمٌ, is also said of a water-skin, meaning It was<br>\
left, or neglected, by its owners, after its being<br>\
seasoned with rob, [for غيته, in the phrase بعد<br>\
غيته, an evident mistranscription, I read, conjecturally, تَمْتِينِهِ, as the only word at all resembling غيته, that I can call to mind, having an<br>\
apposite signification,] and they did not anoint it,<br>\
or grease it, so that it became spoilt, or in a bad<br>\
state, and did not retain the water: the epithet<br>\
applied to it in this case is ↓ رَحِمٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
رَحَامَةٌ is also an inf. n. [of which the verb, if it<br>\
have one, is app. رَحُمَ,] signifying The being connected by relationship. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
رحّم عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. تَرْحِيمٌ; and ↓ ترحّم; but<br>\
the former is the more chaste; He said to him,<br>\
رَحِمَكَ اللّٰهُ [May God have mercy on thee;<br>\
&amp;c.]. (K.)<br>\
5<br>\
ترحّم عَلَيْهِ and<br>\
ترحّمهُ: for both see 1; and<br>\
for the former see also 2. [Accord. to different<br>\
authorities, it appears that both may be rendered<br>\
He had mercy, or pity, or compassion, on him;<br>\
or he pitied, or compassionated, him: (see 1:) or<br>\
he pitied him, or compassionated him, much: (see<br>\
what follows:) and the former, he said to him,<br>\
May God have mercy on thee; &amp;c.; (see 2;) or<br>\
he expressed a wish that God would have mercy<br>\
on him; or he expressed pity, or compassion, for<br>\
him: and also he affected, or constrained himself<br>\
to have or to show, pity, or compassion.] Though<br>\
تَرَحَّمْتُ عَلَيْهِ is mentioned by J, and not رَحَّمّهُ,<br>\
some say that the former is incorrect: and it is said<br>\
that تَرَحُّمٌ implies self-constraint, and therefore is<br>\
not to be attributed to God: but some repudiate<br>\
this assertion, because it occurs in correct traditions, and because تَفَعُّلٌ is not restricted to the<br>\
denoting peculiarly self-constraint, but has other<br>\
properties, as in the instances of تَوَحُّدٌ and تَكَبُّرٌ,<br>\
denoting intensiveness and muchness. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تراحموا signifies رَحِمَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا [They had<br>\
mercy, or pity, or compassion, one on another;<br>\
&amp;c.]. (S, TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استرحمهُ He asked, or demanded, of him<br>\
الرَّحْمَة [i. e. mercy, or pity, or compassion; &amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رَحْمٌ: see its syn. رَحِمٌ, in two places.<br>\
رُحْمٌ: see its syn. رَحْمَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] أُمُّ رُحْمٍ<br>\
one of the names of Mekkeh; (S, K; *) as also<br>\
أُمُّ الرُّحْمِ; (K;) meaning the source of الرَّحْمَة<br>\
[or mercy, &amp;c.]. (TA.) [See also زُحْمٌ.]<br>\
رِحْمٌ: see its syn. رَحِمٌ, in two places.<br>\
رَحَمٌ The coming forth of the womb, in consequence of a disease. (IAar, TA.) [See also رَحِمَتْ<br>\
and رَحِمَ, of each of which it is an inf. n.]<br>\
رَحِمٌ The womb, i. e. the place of origin, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) and the receptacle, (Mgh, K,) of the<br>\
young, (Mgh, Msb, K,) in the belly; (Mgh;) as<br>\
also ↓ رِحْمٌ, (Msb, K,) a contraction of the former,<br>\
and ↓ رَحْمٌ, which is of the dial. of Benoo-Kiláb:<br>\
(Msb:) in this sense, (Msb,) which is the primary signification, (Mgh,) [i. e.] as meaning the<br>\
رَحِم of the female, (S,) it is fem.; (S, Msb;) or,<br>\
as some say, masc.; (Msb;) but IB cites a verse<br>\
in which رِحْم is fem.: (TA:) pl. أَرْحَامٌ. (MA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (Mgh, Msb,) as also ↓ رِحْمٌ (S, Msb,<br>\
K) and ↓ رَحْمٌ, (Msb,) (tropical:)  Relationship; i. e. nearness of kin; syn. قَرَابَةٌ: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) [by<br>\
some restricted to relationship by the female side;<br>\
as will be shown below:] and connexion by birth:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) or relationship connecting with a<br>\
father or an ancestor: or near relationship: so<br>\
in the T: (TA:) or a connexion, or tie, of relationship: (A, TA:) or the ties of relationship:<br>\
(M, K, TA:) accord. to the K, الرَّحِمُ signifies<br>\
القَرَابَةُ or أَصْلُهَا and أَسْبَابُهَا: but in the M it is said,<br>\
الرَّحِمُ أَسْبَابُ القَرَابَةِ وَأَصْلُهَا الرَّحِمُ الَّتِى هِىَ مَنْبِتُ<br>\
الوَلَدِ; in which وَأَصْلُهَا forms no part of the explanation of الرحم, as the author of the K asserts<br>\
it to do: (TA:) as meaning relationship, رحم is<br>\
in most instances masc.: (Msb:) pl. as above.<br>\
(K.) It is said in a holy tradition (حَدِيث قُدْسِىّ<br>\
[i. e. an inspired or a revealed tradition]) that<br>\
God said, when He created الرَّحِم [meaning “ relationship,” &amp;c.], أَنَا الَّحْمٰنُ وَأَنْتَ الرَّحِمُ شَقَقْتُ<br>\
اسْمَكَ مِنِ اسْمِى فَمَنْ وَصَلَكَ وَصَلْتُهُ وَمَنْ قَطَعَكَ<br>\
قَطَعْتُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [I am الرحمٰن and thou art الرحم: I<br>\
have derived thy name from my name: therefore<br>\
whoso maketh thee close, I will make him close;<br>\
and who severeth thee, I will sever him]. (TA.)<br>\
[وَصَلَ رَحِمَهُ means (assumed tropical:)  He made close his tie, or<br>\
ties, of relationship, by kind behaviour to his<br>\
kindred: and قَطَعَ رَحِمَهُ, He severed his tie, or<br>\
ties, of relationship, by unkind behaviour to his<br>\
kindred: see art. وصل: and see also بَلَّ رَحِمَهُ,<br>\
in the first paragraph of art. بل; and a verse<br>\
there cited.] ―<br>\
-b3-  ذُو الرَّحِمِ means (assumed tropical:)  [The possessor<br>\
of relationship, &amp;c.; i. e.] the contr. of الأَجْنَبِىُّ:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) the pl. ذَوُو الأَرْحَامِ, [or, as in the<br>\
Kur viii. last verse, and xxxiii. 6, أُولُو الأَرْحَامِ,]<br>\
in the classical language, means any relations:<br>\
and in law, any relations that have no portion<br>\
[of the inheritances termed فَرَائِض] and are not<br>\
[such heirs as are designated by the appellation]<br>\
عَصَبَة [q. v.]; (KT, TA in art. ذو;) [i. e.,] with<br>\
respect to the فَرَائِض, it means the relations by<br>\
the women&#39;s side. (IAth, TA in the present art.)<br>\
ذُو رَحِمٍ مَحْرَمٍ and [some say] مُحَرَّمٍ [and ذُو رَحِمٍ<br>\
مَحْرَمٌ also (see art. حرم)] mean (assumed tropical:)  A relation whom<br>\
it is unlawful to marry, [whether male or female,<br>\
the latter being included with the former, but the<br>\
female, when particularly meant, is termed ذَاتُ<br>\
رَحِمٍ مَحْرَمٍ &amp;c.,] such as the mother and the<br>\
daughter and the sister and the paternal aunt<br>\
and the maternal aunt [and the male relations of<br>\
such degrees]: and most of the learned, of the<br>\
Companions and of the generation following<br>\
these, and Aboo-Haneefeh and his companions,<br>\
and Ahmad [Ibn-Hambal], hold that when one<br>\
possesses a person that is termed ذُو رَحِمٍ مَحْرَمٍ,<br>\
this person becomes emancipated, whether male<br>\
or female; but Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee and others of the<br>\
Imáms and of the Companions and of the generation following these hold that the children and<br>\
the fathers and the mothers become emancipated,<br>\
and not any others than these. (IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
[حَاسَّةُ رَحِمٍ means (assumed tropical:)  A feeling of relationship or<br>\
consanguinity, or sympathy of blood; and in like<br>\
manner, elliptically, رَحِمٌ alone. You say, أَطَّتْ<br>\
لَهُ مِنِّى حَاسَّةُ رَحِمٍ; expl. in art. حس: and أَطَّتْ<br>\
لَهُ رَحِمِى; and أَطَّتْ بِكَ الرَّحِمُ; expl. in art. اط.<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  رَحِمٌ is also often used for فَرْجٌ or حَيَآءٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  The vulva: see, for exs., شُفْرٌ, and 1 in art.<br>\
ظآر, and 8 in art. حوص.]<br>\
-A2-  As an epithet, with<br>\
ة, applied to a she-camel: see رَحُومٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  And as<br>\
an epithet without ة, applied to a water-skin: see<br>\
1, last sentence but one.<br>\
رُحُمٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  It is also pl.<br>\
of رَحُومٌ. (TA.)<br>\
رَحْمَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ رَحَمَةٌ (Sb, K) and<br>\
↓ رُحْمٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ رُحُمٌ, (S, K,) thus in a<br>\
verse of Zuheyr, (S, TA,) and thus in the Kur<br>\
xviii. 80 accord. to the reading of Aboo-&#39;Amr<br>\
Ibn-El-&#39;Alà, (TA,) and ↓ مَرْحَمَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
of which last مَرَاحِمُ is pl., (TA,) [all inf. ns.;<br>\
when used as simple substs. signifying Mercy,<br>\
pity, or compassion; i. e.] tenderness (S, Msb, K,<br>\
and Bd on the بَسْمَلَة) of heart; (Bd ibid.;) and<br>\
inclination to favour, (S, Msb, K,) or inclination<br>\
requiring the exercise of favour and beneficence:<br>\
(Bd ubi suprà:) and pardon, or forgiveness: (K:)<br>\
accord. to Er-Rághib, رَحْمَةٌ signifies tenderness<br>\
requiring the exercise of beneficence towards the<br>\
object thereof: and it is used sometimes as meaning tenderness divested of any other attribute:<br>\
and sometimes as meaning beneficence divested<br>\
of tenderness; as when it is used as an attribute<br>\
of the Creator: when used as an attribute of men,<br>\
it means tenderness, and inclination to favour<br>\
[without necessarily implying beneficence]: accord.<br>\
to El-Káshánee, it is of two kinds; namely, gratuitous, and obligatory: the former is that which<br>\
pours forth favours, or benefits, antecedently to<br>\
works; and this is the رحمة that embraces everything: the obligatory is that which is promised<br>\
to the pious and the doers of good, in the Kur<br>\
vii. 155 and vii. 54: but this, he says, is included<br>\
in the gratuitous, because the promise to bestow it<br>\
for works is purely gratuitous: accord. to the explanation of the Imám Aboo-Is-hák Ahmad Ibn-Mohammad-Ibn-Ibráheem Eth-Thaalebee, it is<br>\
God&#39;s desire to do good to the deserving thereof;<br>\
so that it is an essential attribute: or the abstaining from punishing him who deserves punishment,<br>\
and doing good to him who does not deserve<br>\
[this]; so that it is an attribute of operation.<br>\
(TA.) The saying in the Kur [xxi. 75] وَأَدْخَلْنَاهُ<br>\
فِى رَحْمَتِنَا (tropical:)  [And we caused him to enter into our<br>\
mercy] is tropical: so says IJ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَاللّٰهُ<br>\
يَخْتَصُّ بِرَحْمَتِهِ مَنْ يَشَآءُ, in the Kur [ii. 99 and<br>\
iii. 67], means (assumed tropical:)  [And God distinguishes] with<br>\
his gift of prophecy [whom He will], or his prophetic office or commission. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  رَحْمَةٌ<br>\
also means (assumed tropical:)  Sustenance, or the means of subsistence: this is said to be its meaning as used in<br>\
the Kur xli. 50. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  Rain: (TA:)<br>\
so in the Kur vii. 55. (Bd, Jel.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  Plenty;<br>\
or abundance of herbage, and of the goods, conveniences, or comforts, of life: so in the Kur x. 22<br>\
and xxx. 35. (TA.)<br>\
رَحَمَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
رُحْمَى [The saying رَحِمَكَ اللّٰهُ May God have<br>\
mercy on thee; &amp;c.;] a subst. from رَحَّمَ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
[like بُقْيَا from أَبْقَى عَلَيْهِ]. (K.)<br>\
رَحْمَآءُ: see رَحُومٌ.<br>\
الرَّحْمٰنُ [thus generally written when it has<br>\
the article ال prefixed to it, but in other cases<br>\
رَحْمَانُ, imperfectly decl.,] and ↓ الرَّحِيمُ are names<br>\
[or epithets] applied to God: (TA:) [the former,<br>\
considered as belonging to a large class of words<br>\
expressive of passion or sensation, such as غَضْبَانُ<br>\
and عَطْشَانُ &amp;c., but, being applied to God, as<br>\
being used tropically, or anthropopathically, may<br>\
be rendered The Compassionate: ↓ the latter, considered as expressive of a constant attribute with<br>\
somewhat of intensiveness, agreeably with analogy, may be rendered the Merciful: but they<br>\
are variously explained: it is said that] they are<br>\
both names [or epithets] formed to denote intensiveness of signification, from رَحِمَ; like الغَضْبَانُ<br>\
from غَضِبَ, and العَلِيمُ from عَلِمَ; and الرَّحْمَةُ, in<br>\
the proper language, is “ tenderness of heart,”<br>\
and “ inclination requiring the exercise of favour<br>\
and beneficence; ” but the names of God are<br>\
only to be taken [or understood] with regard to<br>\
the ultimate imports, which are actions, exclusively of the primary imports, which may be<br>\
passions: and the former is more intensive in<br>\
signification than the latter; the former including<br>\
in its objects the believer and the unbeliever,<br>\
and ↓ the latter having for its peculiar object the<br>\
believer: (Bd on the بَسْمَلَة:) accord. to J, (TA,)<br>\
they are two names [or epithets] derived from<br>\
الرَّحْمَةُ, and are like نَدْمَانُ and نَدِيمٌ, and are<br>\
syn.; the repetition being allowable when the<br>\
[mode of] derivation is different, for the purpose<br>\
of corroboration: (S, TA:) or the repetition is<br>\
because the former is Hebrew, [originally 165,]<br>\
and ↓ the latter is Arabic: (I&#39;Ab, TA:) but the<br>\
former is applicable to God only; though Museylimeh the Liar was called رَحْمَانُ اليَمَامَةِ; (S,<br>\
TA;) and it is said to mean the Possessor of the<br>\
utmost degree of الرَّحْمَة; and accord. to Zj, is a<br>\
name of God mentioned in the most ancient<br>\
books: (TA:) whereas ↓ the latter is syn. with<br>\
↓ الرَّاحِمُ: (S, TA:) or [rather] ↓ رَاحِمٌ is the act.<br>\
part. n. [signifying having mercy, &amp;c.], and<br>\
↓ رَحِيمٌ has an intensive signification [i. e. having<br>\
much mercy, &amp;c.]: (Msb:) the latter is applied<br>\
also to a man; and so is ↓ رَحُومٌ, in the same<br>\
sense, and likewise to a woman: (TA:) the pl. of<br>\
↓ رَحِيمٌ is رُحَمَآءُ; (Msb, TA;) occurring in the trad.,<br>\
إِنَّمَا يَرْحَمُ اللّٰهُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ الرُّحَمَآءَ, or الرُّحَمَآءُ, as<br>\
related by different persons; [i. e. God has mercy<br>\
on the merciful only of his servants, or verily<br>\
those on whom God has mercy, of his servants,<br>\
are the merciful;] الرحماء being in the accus.<br>\
case as the objective complement of يرحم, and in<br>\
the nom. case as the enunciative of ما in the sense<br>\
of الَّذِى. (Msb.)<br>\
رَحَمُوتٌ is from رَحْمَةٌ, [with which it is syn.,]<br>\
(S, TA,) but it is used only coupled with its like<br>\
in form: (K, TA:) one says, رَهَبُوتٌ خَيْرٌ لَكَ مِنْ<br>\
رَحَمُوتٍ [Fear is better for thee than pity, or<br>\
compassion], meaning thy being feared is better<br>\
than thy being pitied, or compassionated: (S, K:<br>\
but in the former, without لك:) or, accord. to<br>\
Mbr, ↓ رَهَبُوتَى خَيْرٌ مِنْ رَحَمُوتَى. (Meyd. [See<br>\
art. رهب.])<br>\
رَحَمُوتَى: see what next precedes.<br>\
رُحَامٌ: see 1, last sentence but two.<br>\
رَحُومٌ (Lh, S, K) and ↓ رَحْمَآءُ, (K,) applied to<br>\
a she-camel, (Lh, S, TA,) and to a ewe or she-goat, and to a woman, (TA,) [and app. to any<br>\
animal having a womb, (see رَحُمَتْ)] Having a<br>\
complaint of her womb (Lh, S, M, K) after<br>\
bringing forth, (Lh, S, K,) and dying in consequence thereof; (K;) and ↓ رَحِمَةٌ, applied to a<br>\
she-camel, signifies the same: the pl. of رَحُومٌ is<br>\
رُحُمٌ, with two dammehs. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  For the first,<br>\
see also الرَّحْمٰنُ, near the end of the paragraph.<br>\
رَحِيمُ: see الرَّحْمٰنُ, in seven places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Sometimes it is syn. with ↓ مَرْحُومٌ [i. e. Treated, or<br>\
regarded, with mercy or pity or compassion;<br>\
&amp;c.: see 1, first sentence]: &#39;Amelles Ibn-&#39;Akeel<br>\
says, (using it in this sense, Ham p. 628,)<br>\
فَأَمَّا إِذَا عَضَّتْ بِكَ الحَرْبُ عَضَّةً<br>\
فَإِنَّكَ مَعْطُوفٌ عَلَيْكَ رَحِيمُ<br>\
(S, and Ham,) i. e. [But at all events,] when war<br>\
becomes [once] severe to thee, and thine enemy<br>\
has almost overcome thee, [verily thou art regarded with favour,] treated with mercy, and<br>\
defended, by us. (Ham.)<br>\
رَاحِمٌ: see الرَّحْمٰنُ, in two places, in the latter<br>\
half of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, applied to a ewe,<br>\
and to a she-goat, Having the womb swollen.<br>\
(Lh, K.)<br>\
أَرْحَمُ [More, and most, merciful, &amp;c.]. God is<br>\
أَرْحَمُ الرَّاحِمينَ [The Most Merciful of those that<br>\
have mercy]. (TA.)<br>\
مَرْحَمَةٌ: see رَحْمَةٌ.<br>\
مُرَحَّمٌ [Treated, or regarded, with much mercy<br>\
or pity or compassion; &amp;c.]: it is with teshdeed<br>\
to denote intensiveness of the signification. (S,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [See also 2, of which it is the pass.<br>\
part. n.]<br>\
مَرْحُومٌ: see رَحِيمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  المَرْحُومَةُ is a name of<br>\
El-Medeeneh. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And المَرْحُومُ, which<br>\
may be rendered The object of God&#39;s mercy, is<br>\
commonly used in the present day as an epithet<br>\
applied to the person, whoever he be, that has<br>\
died in what is believed to be the true faith; as<br>\
though meaning merely the deceased.]<br>\
رحو and رحى<br>\
1<br>\
رَحَتِ الحَيَّةُ, (S, K,) aor. تَرْحُو (S) [and<br>\
app. تَرْحَى also (see رَحْيَةٌ)]; and ↓ ترحّت;<br>\
(S, K;) The serpent turned round about, (S, K,<br>\
