رَزَأَهُ, aor.<br>\
رَزَاَ, inf. n. رُزْءٌ and مَرْزِئَةٌ, He got, or<br>\
obtained, from him good (S, K) of any kind.<br>\
(S.) And رَزَأَ فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا i. q. برّه; [a mistake,<br>\
through an oversight, for قَبِلَ بِرَّهُ; i. e. Such a<br>\
one accepted the bounty of such a one;] as also<br>\
رَزَاهُ, without ء: the former said by AM to be the<br>\
original. (TA.) And رَزَأَ الشَّىْءَ He took from<br>\
the thing, diminished it, lessened it, or impaired<br>\
it; (K;) and ↓ ترازأهُ signifies the same; or he<br>\
took from it, diminished it, &amp;c., by little and<br>\
little. (JM.) You say, رَزَأَهُ مَالَهُ, and رَزِئَهُ مَالَهُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
رَزَاَ, inf. n. رُزْءٌ, He got, or obtained, somewhat<br>\
of his property; as also مَالَهُ ↓ ارتزأهُ. (K.) And<br>\
مَا رَزَأْتُهُ مَالَهُ, (S,) and مَا رَزِئْتُهُ مَالَهُ, (S, K, *) I<br>\
did not take from him of his property; or did<br>\
not diminish to him his property. (S, K. *) And<br>\
مَا رَزِئْتُهُ شَيْئًا I did not take from him, or it,<br>\
aught. (Mgh.) And مَا رَزَأَ فُلَانًا شَيْئًا He did not<br>\
get, or obtain, from such a one aught of his<br>\
property; and did not take from him aught<br>\
thereof. (TA.) And مَا رَزَأْتُهُ زِبَالًا I did not take<br>\
from him, or it, as much as an ant would carry<br>\
with its mouth: (Har p. 197:) or thus originally,<br>\
but meaning, anything. (S in art. زبل.) And<br>\
مَا رَزَأْنَا مِنْ مَائِكَ شَيْئًا We took not of, or from,<br>\
thy water, anything: occurring in a trad. (TA.)<br>\
In another trad., as some relate it, رَزِينَا occurs<br>\
for رَزِئْنَا, which is the original. (IAth.) Accord.<br>\
to AZ, [however,] one says, رُزِئْتُهُ, meaning [I<br>\
had it taken, or received, from me; or, virtually,]<br>\
it was taken, or received, from me; but not رُزِيتُهُ.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence, when relating to a moral attribute, or the like, it virtually means (assumed tropical:)  It was<br>\
experienced from me: see a verse cited voce<br>\
مُتْلَدٌ, in art. تلد.] You say also, هُوَ يُرْزَأُ, [virtually] meaning He is a bountiful person; one<br>\
whose gratuitous gifts people obtain. (Ham<br>\
p. 722.) And إِنَّهُ لَقَليِلُ الرُّزْءِ مِنَ الطَّعَامِ Verily he is<br>\
one who gets little of the food. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَزَأْتُهُ<br>\
also signifies I afflicted him with an affliction, a<br>\
misfortune, or a calamity. (Msb.) And رَزَأَتْهُ<br>\
رَزِيْئَةٌ An affliction, a misfortune, or a calamity,<br>\
befell him. (S, Msb.) It is said in a trad., respecting a woman who came asking for her son,<br>\
إِنْ أُرْزَأِ ابْنِى فَلَمْ أُرْزَأْ أَحْبَابِى, meaning If I be<br>\
afflicted by the loss of my son, I have not been<br>\
afflicted by the loss of my friends. (TA.)<br>\

إِرْتَزَاَ see 1.<br>\
-A2-  ارتزأ also signifies It (a thing, S)<br>\
was, or became, diminished, lessened, or impaired.<br>\
(S, K.) A poet says, (namely, Ibn Mukbil, describing a stallion, S in art. زبل,)<br>\
فَلَمْ يَرْتَزِىءْ بِرُكُوبٍ زِبَالَا<br>\
(S, TA) And he had not been lessened [by riding,<br>\
so as to lose] as much as the gnat will carry:<br>\
(TA:) or as much as the ant will carry with its<br>\
mouth; meaning, anything: (S in art. زبل:) but<br>\
some read ترتزىء; [and some, يُرْتَزَأْ, as in copies<br>\
of the S in art. زبل;] and some, بِرُكُونٍ. (TA.)<br>\
رُزْءٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) [originally an inf. n., and]<br>\
a subst. from رَزَأَتْهُ رَزِيْئَةٌ, (Msb,) and ↓ رَزِيْئَةٌ, (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) also pronounced رَزِيَّةٌ, originally<br>\
with ء, (Msb,) and ↓ مَرْزِئَةٌ, (S, K,) An affliction,<br>\
a misfortune, or a calamity, (S, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
by the loss of things dear to one: (TA:) or a<br>\
great affliction or calamity or misfortune: (Mgh:)<br>\
pl. (of the first, S, TA) أَرْزَآءٌ (S, K, TA) and (of<br>\
the second, S, Msb, TA) رَزَايَا. (S, Msb, K, TA.)<br>\
رَزِيْئَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مَرْزِئَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مُرَزَّإٌ; (so in some copies of the S; in others<br>\
مُرْزَأٌ, which is said in the K to be a mistranscription;) pl. مُرَزَّؤُونَ: (K:) A generous man, (S,<br>\
K, * [in the latter of which only the pl. is explained,] and TA,) whose good things men get, or<br>\
obtain, (S,) or from whom much is gotten, or<br>\
obtained. (TA.) One says, in praising, فُلَانٌ<br>\
مُرَزَّأٌ فِى مَالِهِ [Such a one is a person from whom<br>\
much of his property has been obtained]: and in<br>\
expressing pity and grief, فُلَانٌ مُرَزَّأٌ فِى أَهْلِهِ<br>\
[Such a one is a person who has had some one,<br>\
or more, of his family taken from him]. (Ham<br>\
p. 176.) And the pl., mentioned above, also signifies Persons of whom the best have died: (K:)<br>\
or persons of whom death befalls the best. (L.)<br>\
