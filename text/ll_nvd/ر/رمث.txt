they have nothing else with it; sometimes there<br>\
comes forth upon it a white honey, [a species of<br>\
manna,] resembling جُمَان [i. e. pearls, or silver<br>\
beads like pearls], very sweet; it affords firewood,<br>\
and wood for other uses; its kindled firewood is<br>\
hot; and its smoke is beneficial as a remedy for<br>\
the rheum: AHn also says in one place, that,<br>\
accord. to certain of the Basrees, the رمث occupies<br>\
the space of a man sitting, and grows in the<br>\
manner of the شِيح [a species of wormwood]:<br>\
