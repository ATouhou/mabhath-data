load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'رنبأَرْنَبٌ [The hare; and now applied to the rabbit<br>\
also;] a certain animal, (TA,) well known, (M,<br>\
A, K, TA,) like the عناق [?], having short fore<br>\
legs and long hind legs, that treads the ground<br>\
with the hinder parts of its [hind] legs: (TA:)<br>\
a certain very prolific animal, called in Pers.<br>\
خركوش [or خَرْگُوشْ]: it is said that it is one<br>\
year a male and another year a female, and<br>\
menstruates like women; and its fore legs are<br>\
shorter than its hind legs: when it sleeps, it keeps<br>\
its eyes open; and when it is sick, it eats green<br>\
canes (قَصَب), and its sickness ceases: (Kzw:) the<br>\
word is a gen. n., (TA,) of the fem. gender,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) accord. to El-Jáhidh; (TA;) but<br>\
(Msb) applied to the male and the female; (M,<br>\
A, K, TA;) as is also ↓ أَرْنَبَةٌ, (Msb,) which is a<br>\
dial. var.: (Mgh, Msb:) or to the female [only];<br>\
the male being called خُزَزٌ; (T, M, K, TA;)<br>\
accord. to Lth; but others allow its application<br>\
to the male: (T:) the female is also called عِكْرِشَةٌ:<br>\
and the young, خِرْنِقٌ: (TA:) the pl. is أَرَانِبُ<br>\
(T, S, M, Msb, K) and أَرَانٍ, (Lh, S, M, K,) the<br>\
latter, like ثَعَالٍ for ثَعَالِبُ, occurring in poetry,<br>\
(S, M, *) and not allowed by Sb except in poetry.<br>\
(M.) The ا in أَرْنَبٌ is augmentative, accord. to Lth:<br>\
accord. to most of the grammarians it is disjunctive,<br>\
(so in a copy of the T and in the TA,) or radical:<br>\
(so in another copy of the T:) Lth says that<br>\
no word commences with a radical ا but such as<br>\
is triliteral; as أَرْضٌ and أَرْشٌ. (T, TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
one says of the low, abject, or ignominious, and<br>\
weak, إِنَّمَا هُوَ أَرْنَبٌ [He is only a hare]; because<br>\
that animal cannot defend itself, and even the<br>\
lark will endeavour to make it its prey. (A, TA.)<br>\
See another ex. below, voce أَرْنَبَةٌ. [Hence, also,]<br>\
الأَرْنَبُ is the name of (assumed tropical:)  A certain constellation,<br>\
[Lepus,] comprising twelve stars in its figure,<br>\
having no observed stars around it, situate beneath<br>\
the feet of الجَبَّار [i. e. Orion], and facing the<br>\
west. (Kzw.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K,) or ↓ مَرْنَبٌ accord.<br>\
to the L, (TA,) or both, (M,) and ↓ يَرْنَبٌ, A<br>\
جُرَذ [or large field-rat], (M, L, K,) like the jerboa,<br>\
(M, L,) having a short tail. (M, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  الأَرْنَبُ<br>\
البَحْرِىُّ, accord. to Kzw, A certain marine animal,<br>\
the head of which is like that of the أَرْنَب [or<br>\
hare], and the body like that of a fish: or, accord.<br>\
to Ibn-Seenà, a small testaceous animal, which is<br>\
of a poisonous quality when drunk [app. meaning<br>\
in water]: so that, accord. to this explanation,<br>\
the resemblance [to the ارنب commonly so called]<br>\
is in the name, not the form. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A<br>\
sort of ornament worn by women. (M, K.)<br>\
أَرْنَبَةٌ The end, or tip, [i. e. the lower portion,<br>\
or lobule,] of the nose: (T, S, A, K:) this is [also]<br>\
called أَرْنَبَةُ الأَنْفِ: (Mgh, Msb:) it is one of the<br>\
parts that touch the ground in prostration [in<br>\
prayer]: (TA:) pl. أَرَانِبُ. (T, A, TA.) You<br>\
say, جَدَعَ أَرْنَبَتَهُ [lit. He cut off the end of his<br>\
nose;] meaning (assumed tropical:)  he held him in mean estimation,<br>\
or in contempt. (A, TA.) And وَجَدْتُهُمْ مُجَدَّعِى<br>\
↓ الأَرَانِبِ أَشَدَّ فَزَعًا مِنَ الأَرَانِبِ (assumed tropical:)  [I found them to<br>\
be held in contempt, (lit. having the ends of their<br>\
noses cut off,) more fearful than hares]. (A, TA.)<br>\
