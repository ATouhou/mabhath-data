such as an army, and a torrent, and thunder,)<br>\
made a sound or noise; as also ↓ ارتجس. (TA:<br>\
[but in this sense, only the inf. ns. are mentioned,<br>\

رِجْسٌ Uncleanness, dirt, or filth: or an unclean,<br>\
a dirty, or a filthy, thing: syn. قَذَرٌ: (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K, TA: [in the CK, القَدَرُ is put by mistake for القَذَرٌ:]) or شَىْءٌ قَذِرٌ: (TA:) anything<br>\
that is disliked, or hated, for its uncleanness,<br>\
dirtiness, or filthiness: stink, or foul odour:<br>\
accord. to Az, filth that comes forth from the<br>\
body of a man: En-Nakkásh says that it is syn.<br>\
with نِجْسٌ; and it is said in the Bári&#39; that sometimes they say الرَّجَاسَةُ وَالنَّجَاسَةُ, meaning that<br>\
they make these two words syn.: (Msb:) it is<br>\
also written ↓ رَجِسٌ and ↓ رَجَسٌ: (A, K:) you<br>\
say رِجْسٌ نِجْسٌ, and رَجِسٌ نَجِسٌ; and IDrd says,<br>\
I think that they also said رَجَسٌ نَجَسٌ: Pr says<br>\
that when رجس is followed by نجس, the ج is<br>\
with kesr; but when نجس is mentioned without<br>\
رجس, the ج and ن are with fet-h. (TA.) You<br>\
say also شَىْءٌ رِجْسٌ [An unclean, a dirty, or a<br>\
filthy, thing]. (A.) And ↓ مَرَّبِنَا جَمَاعَةٌ رَجِسُونَ<br>\
نَجِسُونَ, meaning, A company of unbelievers<br>\
passed by us. (IAar and TA.) As used in the<br>\
Kur vi. 125, Mujáhid explains الرِّجْس as meaning That in which is no good. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Any<br>\
action that is disliked, or hated, for its uncleanness, dirtiness, or filthiness: (Zj, A, K:) a sin,<br>\
or crime: (Ibn-El-Kelbee, A, K:) so in the<br>\
Kur v. 92, and vi. 146: (Ibn-El-Kelbee:) an<br>\
action that leads to punishment: (T, A, K:) as<br>\
رَجْسٌ signifies “ vehemence of sound,” [see 1,]<br>\
رِجْسٌ seems to mean an action the mention<br>\
whereof is evil, and highly evil: (TA:) sometimes it signifies a thing that is unlawful, or<br>\
forbidden: and unbelief: infidelity: (L:) and<br>\
doubt: (Aboo-Jaafar, A, K:) so in the Kur<br>\
xxxiii. 33. (Aboo-Jaafar.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  Punishment;<br>\
(Fr, T, S, A, K;) a sense which Z makes tropical, as being the recompense of رِجْس [in the<br>\
sense of “ sin ”], (TA;) and anger: (Fr, S, A,<br>\
K:) so in the Kur x. 100: like رِجْزٌ, which is<br>\
perhaps formed from it by the change of س into<br>\
ز: (Fr, S:) and sometimes, malediction, or execration. (L.)<br>\
-A2-  A light, or slight, motion.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Suggestion of the devil. (TA.)<br>\

(TA.) You say, [of a cloud,] هٰذَا رَاجِسٌ حَسَنٌ<br>\
This is a goodly thunderer. (S.) And عَفَتِ الدِّيَارَ<br>\
الغَمَائِمُ الرَّوَاجِسُ وَالرِّيَاحُ الرَّوَامِسُ [The loudthundering clouds and the dust-spreading winds<br>\
effaced the traces of the dwellings]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And<br>\
in like manner,] ↓ رَجَّاسٌ (S, K) and ↓ رَجُوسٌ and<br>\
↓ مِرْجَسٌ (K) A camel that brays vehemently.<br>\

[fem. of ↓ أَرْجَسُ,] A she-camel that utters the<br>\
[yearning cry termed] حَنِين consecutively, or continuously. (IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence,] ↓ الرَجَّاسُ<br>\
The sea: (K:) because of the sound of its waves;<br>\
or because of its commotion. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  رَاجِسٌ<br>\
also signifies The thrower of the مِرْجَاس; (K;)<br>\
and so ↓ مُرْجِسٌ. (TA.)<br>\
أَرْجَسُ; and its fem. رَجْسَآءُ: see رَاجِسٌ.<br>\
مُرْجِسٌ: see رَاجِسٌ, last sentence.<br>\
مِرْجَسٌ: see رَاجِسٌ.<br>\
مِرْجَاسٌ A stone which is tied to the end of a<br>\
rope, and which is then let down into a well, and<br>\
stirs up its black mud, after which the water is<br>\
drawn forth, and thus the well is cleansed: (S,<br>\
K: *) or a stone which is thrown into a well in<br>\
order that one may know, by the sound thereof,<br>\
its depth; or that one may know whether there<br>\
be in it water or not: (IAar, K:) or, accord. to<br>\
ISd, the name by which this is known is مِرْدَاسٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
إِنَّهُ لَرِجْسٌ مَرْجُوسٌ and رجل مَرْجُوسٌ [are phrases<br>\
mentioned, but not explained, in the TA: but I<br>\
think that رجل is a mistranscription for رِجْزٌ; and<br>\
that مرجوس, in each case, is a corroborative].<br>\
هُمْ فِى مَرْجُوسَةٍ, (S, A, K,) and ↓ فى مَرْجُوسَآءَ,<br>\
(TA,) They are in a state of confusion (S, A, K)<br>\
and perturbation, (A,) مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ in respect of<br>\
their affair, or case. (S, TA.)<br>\
مَرْجُوسَآءُ: see what next precedes.<br>\
مُرْتَجِسٌ: see رَاجِسٌ.<br>\
نَرْجِسٌ (S, Msb, K) and نِرْجِسٌ (AA, Sgh, Msb,<br>\
K) [The narcissus;] a certain sweet-smelling<br>\
flower, (Msb, * TA,) well known: (Msb, K:)<br>\
the smell of which is beneficial for the cold<br>\
rheum and the cold headache: (K:) the word<br>\
is arabicized, (S, Msb, TA,) from [the Persian] نَرْگِسْ: (TA:) [this being the case, the ن<br>\
should be regarded as radical it is said, however, that] the ن in نَرْجِسٌ is augmentative,<br>\
because there is no word of the measure فَعْلِلٌ,<br>\
but there is of the measure نَفْعِلٌ, (S,) though<br>\
only what is changed, in application, from a<br>\
verb: (Msb:) but نِرْجِسٌ is of the measure فِعْلِلُ;<br>\
(TA;) or it is of the measure نِفْعِلٌ, the augmentative letter being made to accord in its vowel<br>\
with the radical letter in إِذْخِرٌ and that in إِثْمِدٌ<br>\
&amp;c.: (Msb:) or, accord. to IDrd, نَرْجِسٌ is of the<br>\
measure فَعْلِلٌ, and the only instance of that<br>\
measure. (TA in art. نرجس.) If you name a<br>\
man نَرْجِس, you make it imperfectly decl., because<br>\
it is like نَضْرِبُ: (S:) but if you name him<br>\
نِرْجِس, it is perfectly decl., because it is of the<br>\
measure فِعْلِلٌ (TA) [or نِفْعِلٌ, neither of which<br>\
is the measure of a verb]. ―<br>\
