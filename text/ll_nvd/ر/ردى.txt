رَدِىَ aor. يَرْدَى, inf. n. رَدًى, He (a man,<br>\
TA) perished. (S, M, Msb, K.) [See an ex. in<br>\
the Kur xx. 17.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And رَدِىَ (AZ, T, M, and<br>\
so in a copy of the S,) aor. يَرْدَى, (AZ, T,) inf. n.<br>\
رَدًى; (M;) or رَدَى; (K, and so in copies of<br>\
the S;) or both of these verbs; aor. of the<br>\
latter يَرْدِى; (TA;) and ↓ تردّى; (S, M, K;) He<br>\
fell into a well: (AZ, * T, * S, K:) or he tumbled<br>\
down into a deep hollow, or cavity, or pit:<br>\
(M:) or ↓ the last of these verbs has this meaning: (Lth, T:) or it signifies he fell into a deep<br>\
hollow, or cavity, or pit: (Msb:) or he tumbled<br>\
down (S) from a mountain; (AZ, T, S;) and so<br>\
the first, or second: (S:) and ↓ تردّى signifies<br>\
he fell from a mountain and died. (TA.) إِذَا<br>\
↓ تَرَدَّى, in the Kur [xcii. 11], means When he<br>\
falls into the abyss of the fire [of Hell]: (T, *<br>\
TA:) or into the cavity of the grave: or into the<br>\
lowest depth of Hell: or when he perishes: (Bd:)<br>\
or when he dies. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And رَدَى He (a man)<br>\
went away. (K.) You say, مَا أَدْرِى أَيْنَ رَدَى I<br>\
know not whither he went away, or has gone away.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
-A2-  رَدَاهُ, (S, M, K,) aor. يَرْدِى, (M,) inf. n.<br>\
رَدْىٌ, (TK,) He broke it; (M, K;) namely, a thing<br>\
with a stone: (M:) or he beat it, [or battered it,]<br>\
namely, a stone with a piece of rock, or with a pickaxe, in order to break it. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He dashed<br>\
himself against him, or knocked against him,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) like as the pickaxe knocks against<br>\
the stone. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And رَدَاهُ بِحَجَرٍ, (T, K,) or<br>\
بِحِجَارَةٍ, (S,) aor. يَرْدِى, inf. n. رَدْىٌ; (T;) and<br>\
رَدَاهُ بِحَجَرٍ, (K and TA in art. ردو,) aor. يَرْدُو,<br>\
inf. n. رَدْوٌ, (TA,) with و for the final radical;<br>\
(K, TA;) [like رَدَأَهُ, and دَرَأَهُ;] He threw at him,<br>\
or threw at him and hit him, with a stone, or<br>\
stones. (T, S, M.) [It is also said in the T, with<br>\
reference to مِرْدَاةٌ, as signifying a large stone<br>\
with which other stones are beaten, or battered,<br>\
الرَّدْىُ إِنَّمَا هُوَ رَفْعٌ بِهَا وَرَمْىٌ بِهَا; but I think that<br>\
رَفْعٌ is a mistranscription for دَفْعٌ; and that the<br>\
meaning intended to be expressed by these words<br>\
is, that رَدْىٌ signifies The thrusting with a مِرْدَاة;<br>\
and the throwing it, or with it.] ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence, app.,]<br>\
رَدَى said of a horse, (As, ISk, T, S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
يَرْدِى, (As, ISk, T, S, K,) inf. n. رَدْىٌ and رَدَيَانٌ;<br>\
(ISk, S, M, K;) and رَدَا, (K and TA in art. ردو,<br>\
[in the CK, و is omitted before the word لُغَةٌ in<br>\
that art.,]) aor. يَرْدُو; (TA;) [and, accord. to<br>\
Freytag, ↓ ارتدى is used in the same sense by<br>\
Jereer;] He beat, or battered, the ground, (رَجَمَ<br>\
الأَرْضَ, As, ISk, T, S, ISk, T, S, M, K,) with his hoofs,<br>\
(M, K, TA,) in running, (As, T,) or in going<br>\
along, and in running, (M,) or in going a pace<br>\
between running and vehement walking: (ISk,<br>\
S:) or رَدَيَانٌ signifies the same as تَقْرِيبٌ: (AZ,<br>\
T, M: [see 2 in art. قرب:]) or it is [a manner of<br>\
going] between running and walking: (K:) or<br>\
the running (T, S, M) of the horse (T) or of the<br>\
ass (S, M) between his آرِىّ [or place of confinement, or the loop to which he is tied,] and<br>\
his مُتَمَعَّك [or place of rolling upon the ground];<br>\
(T, S, M;) thus explained by El-Munteji&#39; Ibn-Nebhán, (T, S,) to As. (S.) In the K, رَجَمَتْ<br>\
is erroneously put for رَجَمَ; being app. taken<br>\
from the M, in which it refers to horses; [not to<br>\
a single horse;] as does also the pronoun in<br>\
بِحَوَافِرِهَا, in the same portion of the passage in<br>\
the K and in the M. (TA.) Accord. to AZ,<br>\
this is from رَدَيَانُ الجَوَارِى, explained in what<br>\
follows. (Ham p. 221.) ―<br>\
-b5-  You say, رَدَتِ الجَارِيَةُ<br>\
The girl raised one leg and went along upon the<br>\
other, in play; (K, TA;) and so ↓ اِرْتَدَت: (TA:)<br>\
and الجَوَارِى يُرْدِينَ, inf. n. رَدَيَانٌ; (M;) or<br>\
↓ يَرْتَدِينَ; (T;) the girls played, (T, M,) raising<br>\
one leg, (M,) or one of them raising one leg, (T,)<br>\
and going along upon the other: (T, M:) or<br>\
رَدَيَانُ الجَوَارِى signifies the girls&#39; playing in which<br>\
one of them raises one leg and steps with the<br>\
other two steps, and then puts it down and raises<br>\
the other, doing thus several times. (AZ, Ham<br>\
p. 221.) And رَدَى الغُلَامُ The boy raised one leg<br>\
and leaped, or jumped, [or hopped,] with the<br>\
other. (S.) And رَدَى الغُرَابُ, (M, K,) aor.<br>\
يَرْدِى, (T,) The crow, or raven, raised one leg<br>\
and hopped on the other; or leaped along. (T,<br>\
M, K.)<br>\
-A3-  رَدَتْ غَنَمِى My sheep, or goats, increased, or exceeded; as also ↓ أَرْدَتْ. (Fr, M,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And رَدَيْتُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ and ↓ ارديت I<br>\
exceeded the thing. (M.) And عَلَى غَيْرِهِ ↓ اردى<br>\
It exceeded another thing; as also اردأ [q. v.]<br>\
(M in art. ردأ.) And رَدَيْتُ عَلَى الخَمْسِينَ, (S,<br>\
M, *) and الثَّمَانِينَ, (M,) and ↓ ارديت, (S,) I<br>\
exceeded [the age of fifty, and eighty]. (S, M. *)<br>\
2<br>\
ردّاهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. تَرْدِيَةٌ, (Msb,) He<br>\
made him to fall, or threw him down, (Msb, K,)<br>\
into a deep hollow, or cavity, or pit, (Msb,) or<br>\
into a well; as also ↓ ارداهُ. (K.) He (God)<br>\
overthrew him; as also ↓ ارداهُ. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  رَدَّيْتُهُ,<br>\
inf. n. as above, I clad him with a رِدَآء [q.<br>\
v.]. (S.)<br>\
3<br>\
رَادَيْتُ عَن القَوْم, (S, K. *) inf. n. مُرَادَاةٌ, (S,)<br>\
I contended in throwing stones in defence of the<br>\
people, or party. (S, K. *)<br>\
-A2-  راداهُ, (T, S, M, K,)<br>\
inf. n. as above, (TA,) is also syn. with رَاوَدَهُ [He<br>\
endeavoured to turn him; or to turn him by<br>\
blandishment, or by deceitful arts; or to entice<br>\
him to turn]; (S, M, K;) formed from the latter<br>\
by transposition; (S;) or دَاوَرَهُ [which means the<br>\
same]; عَلَى الأَمْرِ [to the thing, or  affair]: (T as<br>\
on the authority of A &#39;Obeyd:) and دَارَاهُ [which<br>\
means the same; or he treated him with gentleness, or blandishment; soothed, coaxed, wheedled,<br>\
or cajoled, him; or he deceived, deluded, beguiled,<br>\
circumvented, or outwitted, him; or endeavoured,<br>\
or desired, to do so]; (S, M, K; the first as on<br>\
the authority of A &#39;Obeyd;) or, accord. to AA,<br>\
i. q. دَاجَاهُ and دَالَاهُ and فَانَاهُ [all of which are<br>\
syn. with دَارَاهُ]. (T.)<br>\
4<br>\
ارداهُ He (i. e. God, M, or another, S, M *)<br>\
caused him to perish; or destroyed him. (S, M,<br>\
K.) Hence, (M,) in the Kur [xxxvii. 54],<br>\
إِنْ كِدْتَ لَتُرْدِينِ Verily thou almost causedst me<br>\
to perish, or destroyedst me. (T, M. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also 2, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also He made him (i. e.<br>\
a horse) to go in the manner signified by the verb<br>\
رَدَى [q. v., meaning, beating, or battering, the<br>\
ground, &amp;c.]: so accord. to the M and K, except<br>\
that, in both, the fem. pronoun is used, in the M<br>\
referring to horses, and in the K improperly<br>\
referring to a single horse. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 1,<br>\
last four sentences.<br>\
5<br>\
تردّى: see 1, second and third sentences, in<br>\
four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  He was, or became, overthrown.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, and ↓ ارتدى, He put on, or clad<br>\
himself with, or wore, a رِدَآء [q. v.]: (S, K: but<br>\
in the latter the verbs are fem. [as said of a woman]:) or so تردّى بِرِدَآءٍ and بِهِ ↓ ارتدى. (M,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تردّى بِسَيْفِهِ, and ↓ ارتدى, (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
hung upon himself his sword, putting its suspensory belt or cord upon his neck or shoulder;<br>\
syn. تَقَلَّدَهُ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And تردّت الجَارِيَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
girl, or young woman, put on, or decked herself<br>\
with, a وِشَاح [q. v.], which is also called رِدَآء.<br>\
(T, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
ارتدى: see 1, in the latter half of the paragraph, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  See also 5, in three<br>\
places: and see an ex. voce رِدَآءٌ ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
اِرْتَدَانِى He carried me, or bore me, upon his<br>\
shoulder, in the place of the رِدَآء. (Ham p. 471.)<br>\
رَدًى an inf. n. of رَدِىَ [q. v.]. (S, M, Msb, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Excess, redundance, or superfluity; syn.<br>\
زِيَادَةٌ: so in the saying, مَا بَلَغْتُ رَدَى عَطِيَّتِكَ,<br>\
i. e. I have not attained to thy excess, &amp;c., in thy<br>\
gift: and يُعْجِبُنِى رَدَى قَوْلِكَ The excess of thy<br>\
saying pleases me: and so in the saying of<br>\
Kutheiyir,<br>\
لَهُ عَهْدُ وُدٍّ لَمْ يَكَدَّرْ يَزِينُهُ<br>\
رَدَى قَوْلِ مَعْرُوفٍ حَدِيثٍ وَمُزْمِنِ<br>\
meaning [He has a covenant of love, or affection,<br>\
into which he has entered, which has not been<br>\
sullied, and] which excess of kind speech, on his<br>\
part, [recent and of long duration,] adorns: (T:)<br>\
or, [as ISd cites the verse,] قَوْلِ مَعْرُوفٍ ↓ رَدِى<br>\
&amp;c.: [and he adds,] it is said, in explanation<br>\
thereof, that رَدِى means زِيَادَة; and I think that<br>\
it is an inf. n., of the measure فَعِلٌ, like ضَحِكٌ and<br>\
حَبِقٌ, or a subst. put in the place of an inf. n.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
-A3-  See also رَدَاةٌ.<br>\
رَدٍ [originally رَدِىٌ] Perishing; (IAar, T, S,<br>\
M, K;) applied to a man: fem. رَدِيَةٌ. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
رِدْيَةٌ A mode, or manner, of wearing the رِدَآء:<br>\
(S, M, * Msb: *) like رِكْبَةٌ from الرُّكُوبُ, and<br>\
جِلْسَةٌ from الجُلُوسُ: (S:) you say, هُوَ حَسَنُ<br>\
الرِّدْيَةِ [He is comely in respect of the manner of<br>\
wearing the ردآء] (S, M, Msb.)<br>\
رَدَاةٌ A rock; or piece of rock; or great mass of<br>\
stone, or of hard stone: (Fr, T, S, K:) pl. رَدَيَاتٌ<br>\
(Fr, T) and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ رَدًى. (S, K.)<br>\
رِدَآءٌ A certain garment; (S, Msb;) a kind of<br>\
مِلْحَفَة [or outer wrapping garment], (M, K,)<br>\
well known; (K;) one of the garments that are<br>\
not cut and sewed; (Mgh in art. قطع, and MF<br>\
voce إِزَارٌ;) [being of a single piece;] covering the<br>\
upper half of the body; or lying upon the shoulders and back; (MF voce إِزَارٌ;) or falling upon<br>\
the belly and there ending: (TA voce صِفْرٌ:) [a<br>\
رداء worn by Mohammad, “thrown over the left<br>\
shoulder and wrapped round the body under the<br>\
right arm,” is described as “four cubits long and<br>\
two cubits and a span wide:” (Sprenger&#39;s Life of<br>\
Mohammad, Part I, English ed., pp. 86 and 87:)]<br>\
it is of the masc. gender, and it is not allowable<br>\
to make it fem.: (IAmb, Msb:) the dual is<br>\
رِدَاآنِ and رِدَاوَانِ the latter being allowable,<br>\
(S, Msb,) but the former being preferable: (S:)<br>\
and the pl. is أَرْدِيَةٌ: (S, M, Msb:) the رِدَآء is also<br>\
called ↓ رِدَآءَةٌ, (M, K, TA, [in the CK رِداة,]) like<br>\
as the إِزَار is also called إِزَارَةق; (M;) and ↓ مِرْدَاةٌ,<br>\
(K, TA, in the CK مَرْداة,) of which the pl. is<br>\
↓ مَرَادٍ, (TA,) occurring in the saying,<br>\
مَرَادِىَ الحَرِيرِ ↓ لَا يَرْتَدِى<br>\
وَلَا يُرَى بِسُدَّةِ الأَمِيرِ<br>\
إِلَّا لِحَلْبِ الشَّاْةِ وَالبَعِيرِ<br>\
[He will not wear outer wrapping garments of<br>\
silk, nor will he be seen at the porch of the commander, or prince, unless for the purpose of<br>\
milking the sheep, or goat, and the camel]; (M,<br>\
TA;) المَرَادِى meaning الأَرْدِيَة; (M;) but accord.<br>\
to Th, it has no sing.: (M, TA:) [or] ↓ مَرَادٍ<br>\
signifies waist-wrappers; syn. أُزُرٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
صِفْرُ رِدَائِهَا, in a description of Umm-Zara, in a<br>\
trad., meaning (assumed tropical:)  Lank in her belly; as though<br>\
her ردآء were empty. (TA in art. صفر.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
غَمْرُ الرِّدَآءِ (tropical:)  Abounding in beneficence. (T, M, K,<br>\
TA.) And عَيْشٌ غَمْرُ الرِّدَآءِ (tropical:)  A life ample, or<br>\
plentiful, in its means. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And رِدَآءُ الشَّبَابِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The beauty, and softness, tenderness, or delicateness, of youth. (T.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And رِدَآءُ الشَّمْسِ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
light, (M,) or beauty and light, (T,) of the sun.<br>\
(T, M.) ―<br>\
-b6-  رِدَآءٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A sword; (T, M,<br>\
K;) [ISd says,] I think, as being likened to the<br>\
garment thus called; (M;) [i. e.] because it is<br>\
hung, by its suspensory cords, upon the neck and<br>\
shoulder [like that garment]. (T.) [See also<br>\
مِرْدًى, near the end of the paragraph.] Mutemmem says,<br>\
لَقَدْ كَفَّنَ المِنْهَالُ تَحْتَ رِدَائِهِ<br>\
فَتًى غَيْرَ مِبْطَانِ العَشِيَّاتِ أَرْوَعَا<br>\
[Verily El-Minhál has shrouded beneath his<br>\
sword a young man not voracious in the evenings,<br>\
when the chief meal is eaten, one who excited the<br>\
admiration of the beholder]: for El-Minhál had<br>\
slain his [the poet&#39;s] brother Málik; and when a<br>\
man slew another who was a celebrated man, he<br>\
used to lay his sword upon him, in order that his<br>\
slayer might be known. (M. [But see, in relation to this verse, a long story in the Ham<br>\
pp. 370-372.]) And El-Khansà says,<br>\
جَعَلْتَ رِدَآءَكَ فِيهَا خِمَارَا  وَدَاهِيَةٍ جَرَّهَا جَارِمٌ<br>\
[And in many a calamity which a committer of<br>\
a crime has brought to pass, thou hast made thy<br>\
sword to be as a covering to the head]; meaning,<br>\
thou hast smitten, therein, the necks of thine<br>\
enemies with thy sword like the خمار [which<br>\
means a woman&#39;s “muffler” and a man&#39;s “turban”]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A bow; (AAF, M, IAth;)<br>\
because it is borne upon the shoulder, which is<br>\
the place of the رداء [properly thus called].<br>\
(IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And [for the like reason] (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
[ornament called] وِشَاح [q. v., worn by women].<br>\
(T, K.) So in a verse of El-Aashà, cited voce<br>\
رَقْرَقَ. (T.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And (assumed tropical:)  A bier; because it is borne<br>\
upon the place of the رداء [properly thus called,<br>\
i. e., upon the shoulder]. (Ham p. 471.) ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
And (assumed tropical:)  Debt; (T, M, K;) because it is [regarded<br>\
as] a thing that cleaves to the neck of the debtor,<br>\
like as the رداء [properly thus called] cleaves<br>\
to the shoulders of the wearer. (T.) You say,<br>\
هُوَ خَفِيفُ الرِّدَآءِ, meaning (tropical:)  He is little burdened<br>\
in respect of debt: and also, in respect of household. (K, * TA.) [See also an ex. voce نَسَآءٌ.] ―<br>\
-b11-<br>\
Also (assumed tropical:)  Intelligence: ―<br>\
-b12-  and (assumed tropical:)  ignorance: (M,<br>\
K:) both on the authority of IAar: (M:) ―<br>\
-b13-  he<br>\
says also that it means (assumed tropical:)  anything that is the<br>\
pride, or ornament, of a person; (T, M;) even,<br>\
(M,) for instance, one&#39;s house, and one&#39;s father;<br>\
(T, M;) or one&#39;s house and one&#39;s beast; (so in<br>\
the TA;) each of these, he says, is one&#39;s رداء [or<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  pride]: (T:) thus, (M,) it is (assumed tropical:)  a thing that<br>\
graces: and (assumed tropical:)  a thing that disgraces: (M, K:)<br>\
so that it has two contr. meanings: thus in the<br>\
K, referring to the meanings of “intelligence”<br>\
and “ignorance:” but this requires consideration.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رِدَآءَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, first<br>\
signification.<br>\
رَدِىٌّ: see رَدِىْءٌ, in art. ردأ<br>\
الرَّادِى The lion; (K;) because he dashes himself (يَرْدِى i. e. يَصْدِمُ) [against his prey]. (TA.)<br>\
مِرْدًى A stone that is thrown; (S, K;) as also<br>\
↓ مِرْدَاةٌ: (T, S:) or a piece of rock with which<br>\
date-stones are broken: (Ham p. 417:) and accord. to ISk, ↓ the latter signifies a piece of rock<br>\
with which stones are broken, (S,) or with which<br>\
one breaks [anything]: (M:) or a stone which the<br>\
strong man can hardly, or not at all, lift with<br>\
his hands; [like مِرْدَأَةٌ; (TA in art. ردأ;)] with<br>\
which stones are broken; and with which they<br>\
beat and soften a rugged place that they hollow<br>\
out; and with which the hole of the [lizard<br>\
called] ضَبّ is broken, or battered, when it is<br>\
among large stones (فى قلعة [i. e. فِى قَلَعَةٍ]),<br>\
which قلعة it softens and demolishes: (En-Nadr,<br>\
T:) the same word (مرداة) also signifies the stone,<br>\
(T,) or the piece of rock, (M,) by means of which<br>\
the ضَبّ is guided to its hole: (T, M:) [and<br>\
accord. to Golius, on the authority of Meyd and<br>\
the Mirkát el-Loghah, the upper mill-stone:]<br>\
the pl. of مِرْدَاةٌ is ↓ مَرَادٍ: (T:) and this pl. is<br>\
[also] syn. with مَرَامٍ [app. as pl. of مِرْمَاةٌ, and<br>\
meaning the arrows thus called; or any missiles].<br>\
(M.) Hence the prov., ↓ عِنْدَ جُحْرِ كُلِّ ضَبٍّ مِرْدَاتُهُ<br>\
[Near by the hole of every dabb is its stone that<br>\
is to be thrown at it, or its stone by means of<br>\
which it guides itself to that hole]; applied to a<br>\
thing that is near at hand, having no obstacle in<br>\
the way to it; for the dabb will not be guided to<br>\
its hole, when it goes forth from it and returns<br>\
to it, except by means of a stone which it places<br>\
as a mark to point out its hole: (T:) or كُلُّ<br>\
↓ ضَبٍّ عِنْدَهُ مِرْدَاتُهُ (S, M, Meyd) i. e. Every<br>\
dabb has near by it its stone that is to be thrown<br>\
at it; (S, * Meyd;) for the dabb has little knowledge, therefore it prepares not its hole save by a<br>\
stone that may be a mark thereof, so that he who<br>\
seeks it finds the stone that is to be thrown at the<br>\
dabb near to it; therefore the prov. means that<br>\
thou shouldst not feel secure from accidents,<br>\
because calamities are prepared with every time,<br>\
or period; and it is applied to him who exposes<br>\
himself to destruction. (Meyd.) Hence also,<br>\
i. e. from مِرْدًى in the first of the senses assigned<br>\
to it above, (S,) or in the second of those senses,<br>\
(Ham p. 417,) said of a courageous man, إِنَّهُ<br>\
لَمِرْدَى حُرُوبٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily he is like the missile of<br>\
wars]; (S;) or فُلَانٌ مِرْدَى الحُرُوبِ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a<br>\
one is like the crushing stone of the wars]; or<br>\
مِرْدَى الخُصُومِ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  he whom they throw against<br>\
the antagonists and who crushes them: (Ham ubi<br>\
suprà:) and هُمْ مَرَادِى الحُرُوبِ: [مَرَادٍ being pl.<br>\
of مِرْدًى, as well as of مِرْدَاةٌ:] (S:) and فُلَانٌ<br>\
مِرْدَى خُصُومَةٍ وَحَرْبٍ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is very patient<br>\
in the endurance of contention and war. (M.)<br>\
مِرْدًى is also used as meaning (assumed tropical:)  A horse hard like<br>\
the stone thus called; thus in a verse of &#39;Antarah:<br>\
or it there means a horse that runs swiftly; from<br>\
الرَّدَيَانُ [an inf. n. of رَدَى, q. v.]: or it is from<br>\
الرَّدَى [inf. n. of رَدِىَ, and syn. therewith], meaning perdition: or it means, in that verse, [like<br>\
