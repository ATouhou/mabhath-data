رَجَوْتُهُ, aor. أَرْجُوهُ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. رَجْوٌ,<br>\
(S, M, K,) or رُجُوٌّ, (Msb,) and رَجَآءٌ, (S, K, TA,<br>\
&amp;c., [in the CK erroneously written with the<br>\
short ا i. e., without the meddeh and ء,]) or the<br>\
latter is a simple subst., (Msb,) and رَجَاوَةٌ (S, K)<br>\
and رَجَاةٌ, or رَجَآءَةٌ, (accord. to different copies of<br>\
the K,) or both, (CK,) and مَرْجَاةٌ; (K;) and<br>\
↓ رَجَّيْتُهُ, (S,) inf. n. تَرْجِيَةٌ; (K;) and ↓ تَرَجَّيْتُهُ,<br>\
(S, K, *) and ↓ اِرْتَجَيْتُهُ; (S, Msb, K; *) I hoped<br>\
for him [or it; relating only to what is possible;<br>\
syn. with أَمَلْتُهُ; see رَجَآءٌ, below]; all signify the<br>\
same: (S:) and رَجَيْتُهُ, aor. أَرْجِيهِ, is a dial. var.<br>\
of رَجَوْتُهُ: (Msb:) and رَجِيَهُ, aor. يَرْجَاهُ, like<br>\
رَضِيَهُ, is a dial. var. of رَجَاهُ, aor. يَرْجُوهُ, accord.<br>\
to Lth: it is disapproved by Az, because heard<br>\
by him on no other authority than that of Lth;<br>\
but it is mentioned also by ISd. (TA.) One<br>\
says, مَا أَتَيْتُكَ إِلَّا رَجَاوَةَ الخَيْرِ [I did not, or have<br>\
not, come to thee except hoping for that which is<br>\
good]. (S.) No regard is to be paid to the assertion of Lth, that the saying فَعَلْتُ رَجَاةَ كَذَا [I<br>\
did a thing hoping for such a thing] is a mistake,<br>\
and that the correct word is only رَجَآءَ; for رَجَاةٌ<br>\
occurs in a trad., and in the poetry of the Arabs.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Sometimes رَجْوٌ, (S,) or رُجُوٌّ, (Msb,)<br>\
has the meaning of خَوْفٌ; (S, Msb;) because<br>\
the hoper fears that he may not attain the thing<br>\
for which he hopes; (Msb;) and so رَجَآءٌ; (T, S;)<br>\
but only when there is with it a negative particle:<br>\
(Fr, T, TA:) you say, مَا رَجَوْتُكَ (assumed tropical:)  I feared not<br>\
thee: but you do not say, رَجَوْتُكَ, meaning I<br>\
feared thee: (TA:) the saying in the Kur [lxxi.<br>\
12], مَا لَكُمْ لَا تَرْجُونَ لِلّٰهِ وَقَارًا means (assumed tropical:)  [What<br>\
aileth you] that ye will not fear the greatness, or<br>\
majesty, of God? (S:) or the meaning is, that<br>\
ye will not hope for God&#39;s magnifying of him<br>\
who serves Him and obeys Him? or that ye will<br>\
not believe in greatness, or majesty, belonging to<br>\
God, so that ye may fear disobeying Him?<br>\
(Bd:) another instance occurs in a verse of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, cited in art. خلف, conj. 3: (S:) and<br>\
↓ ارتجاهُ, also, signifies (tropical:)  he feared him, or it;<br>\
[but app. only when preceded by a negative<br>\
particle, as in exs. cited in the TA;] (K, TA;)<br>\
in which sense it is tropical. (TA.) Accord. to<br>\
Lth, رَجْوٌ is also syn. with مُبَالَاةٌ; and مَا أَرْجُو<br>\
means مَا أُبَالِى [I do not care, mind, or heed]:<br>\
but this is disapproved by Az. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  رَجِىَ<br>\
He broke off, or ceased, [app. by reason of inability,] from speaking: (K:) or, accord. to Az,<br>\
he became confounded, or perplexed, and unable<br>\
to see his right course: or, as Fr says, he desired<br>\
to speak, and was unable to do so: (TA:) and<br>\
رُجِىَ عَلَيْهِ, like عُنِىَ, he became unable to speak.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
2<br>\
رَجَّوَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
4<br>\
أَرْجَتْ She (a camel, S, or a pregnant female<br>\
[of any kind], TA) was, or became, near to<br>\
bringing forth; (S, K, TA;) so that her bringing<br>\
forth was hoped for: accord. to Er-Rághib, the<br>\
proper signification is she made her owner to have<br>\
hope in himself that her bringing forth was near:<br>\
(TA:) and أَرْجَأَتْ means the same. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
ارجى الصَّيْدَ He failed of getting any game;<br>\
(K;) [as though he made the game to have<br>\
hope;] and ارجأهُ signifies the same: (TA:) or<br>\
so ارجى [alone], and ارجأ [alone]. (K and TA<br>\
in art. رجأ.)<br>\
-A2-  And أَرْجَيْتُهُ, (S, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
إِرْجَآءٌ, (K,) I postponed it, put it off, deferred it,<br>\
or delayed it; (S, Msb, K; *) namely, an affair<br>\
[&amp;c.]; (S;) as also ارجأتهُ. (S, Msb.) [See the<br>\
latter verb: and see also an ex. in the Kur vii.<br>\
108 and xxvi. 35; and the various readings<br>\
mentioned by Bd in the former instance.]<br>\
-A3-<br>\
ارجى البِئْرَ He made a side (رَجًا) to the well.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَرَجَّوَ see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  [In the present day,<br>\
ترجّى is often used as meaning He besought, entreated, petitioned, or prayed.]<br>\
8<br>\
إِرْتَجَوَ see 1, first sentence: ―<br>\
-b2-  and again in the<br>\
latter part of the paragraph.<br>\
رَجًا The side, (K,) in a general sense: (TA:)<br>\
or the side of a well, (S, Msb, K,) and of the<br>\
sky, (Er-Rághib, TA,) and of anything; (S,<br>\
Msb; *) and ↓ رَجَآءٌ signifies the same: (K:) the<br>\
side of a well from its top to its bottom; (TA;)<br>\
and the two sides thereof: which last is also<br>\
[or properly] the meaning of the dual; which is<br>\
رَجَوَانِ: (S:) pl. أَرْجَآءٌ. (S, Msb, K.) Hence,<br>\
in the Kur [lxix. 17], وَالْمَلَكُ عَلَى أَرْجَائِهَا [The<br>\
angels being at the sides thereof]. (S, TA.) They<br>\
said, رُمِىَ بِهِ الرَّجَوَانِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He was cast<br>\
into places of destruction: (S:) or it is said of<br>\
one who is held in mean estimation: (M, TA:)<br>\
اِسْتِهْزَآءٌ in the K is a mistake for اُسْتُهِينَ بِهِ, the<br>\
reading in the M: (TA:) as though the two<br>\
[opposite] sides of the well were cast at with<br>\
him. (K.) And one says of him who will not<br>\
be deceived so as to be turned away from one<br>\
course to another, لَا تُرْمَى بِهِ الرَّجَوَانِ (assumed tropical:)  [lit. The<br>\
two sides of the well will not be cast at with him];<br>\
in allusion to the well&#39;s two [opposite] sides&#39; being<br>\
cast at with the bucket. (Z, TA.)<br>\
رَجَآءٌ [accord. to most an inf. n., (see 1, in two<br>\
senses,) but accord. to the Msb a simple subst.,]<br>\
Hope; syn. أَمَلٌ; (S and M and K in art امل;)<br>\
contr. of يَأْسٌ; (K;) an opinion requiring the<br>\
happening of an event in which will be a cause<br>\
of happiness; (Er-Rághib, TA;) expectation of<br>\
deriving advantage from an event of which a<br>\
cause has already occurred: (El-Harállee, TA:)<br>\
or, as Ibn-El-Kemál says, properly, i. q. أَمَلٌ:<br>\
and conventionally, the clinging of the heart to<br>\
the happening of a future loved event: (TA:) or<br>\
hope, or eager desire, for a thing that may possibly<br>\
happen; differing from تَمَنٍّ, which relates to<br>\
what is possible and to what is impossible. (MF,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also رَجًا.<br>\
رَجِيَّةٌ [A thing hoped for]: you say, مَالَى فِى<br>\
فُلَانٍ رَجِيَّةٌ There is nothing for me to hope for in<br>\
such a one. (S.)<br>\
رَاجٍ [Hoping: ―<br>\
-b2-  and Fearing]. (Msb.)<br>\
أُرْجِيَّةٌ A thing postponed, put off, deferred, or<br>\
delayed. (ISd, K.)<br>\
أُرْجُوَانٌ Redness: (Msb, K:) a certain red dye:<br>\
(K:) or a certain dye, intensely red: (S:) accord.<br>\
to A&#39;Obeyd, (S,) what is called نَشَاسْتَج; (S, K;)<br>\
and he says that the بَهْرَمَان is inferior to it (دُونَهُ<br>\
[but this often has the contr. meaning]): it is<br>\
said also that ارجوان is an arabicized word, from<br>\
the Pers. أَرْغَوَان, which means a sort of trees<br>\
having a red blossom, of the most beautiful kind;<br>\
and that every colour resembling it is termed<br>\
ارجوان. (S.) Also Red: (K:) and red garments or clothes. (IAar, K.) And one says أَحْمَرُ<br>\
أُرْجُوَانٌ, mentioned by Seer has having an intensive<br>\
meaning; (M, TA;) in the K, ↓ أَحْمَرُ أُرْجُوَانِىٌّ;<br>\
but this is wrong; (TA;) i. e. Intensely red.<br>\
(K, TA.) And قَطِيفَةٌ حَمْرَآءُ أُرْجُوَانٌ [A villous,<br>\
or nappy, outer, or wrapping, garment, intensely<br>\
red]: (S, M, A:) but IAth says that the most<br>\
common practice is to prefix the word ثَوْب or قَطِيفَة<br>\
to أُرْجُوَان so as to govern the latter in the gen.<br>\
case; [saying ثَوْبُ أُرْجُوَانٍ or قَطِيفَةُ أُرْجُوَانٍ;]<br>\
and that the word [ارجوان] is said by some to be<br>\
Arabic, the ا and ن being augmentative. (TA.)<br>\
أُرْجُوَانِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
[<br>\
مُرْجًى Postponed, put off, deferred, or delayed;<br>\
as also مُرْجَأٌ.] Some read [in the Kur ix. 107]<br>\
وَآخَرُونَ مُرْجَوْنَ لِأَمْرِ اللّٰهِ. (S: see مرجأ, in art.<br>\
رجأ.)<br>\
[<br>\
مُرْجٍ and مُرْجِيَةٌ and] مُرْجِىءٌ and مُرْجِءَةٌ A<br>\
female near to bringing forth. (K, * TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
مُرْجٍ also signifies A man who is one of the people<br>\
[or sect] called the مُرْجِيَة; (S;) or one of the<br>\
مُرْجِئَة, mentioned in art. رجأ; as also مُرْجِىءٌ; and<br>\
so ↓ مُرْجِىٌّ; (K;) or this is [properly speaking]<br>\
a rel. n. from مُرْجٍ; (S;) and مُرْجِئِىٌّ also; (K;)<br>\
or rather this is another rel. n., like مُرْجِىٌّ. (IB<br>\
and TA in art. رجأ, q. v.)<br>\
مُرْجِى: see what next precedes. You say رَجُلٌ<br>\
مُرْجِىٌّ [A man of, or belonging to, the sect called<br>\
the مُرْجِيَة]. (S.)<br>\
