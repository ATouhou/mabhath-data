رَيَيْتُ and ↓ رَيَّيْتُ, inf. n. of the former رَىٌّ<br>\
and of the latter تَرْيِيَةٌ, are both of them verbs<br>\
relating to الرَّايَةُ: (T:) you say, الرَّايَةَ ↓ رَيَّيْتُ<br>\
[and رَيَيْتُهَا] I made the رَايَة [q. v.]: (M, TA:)<br>\
the imperative of رَيَيْتُ is اِرْيَهْ, and that of ↓ رَيَّيْتُ<br>\
is رَيِّهْ: and the pass. part. ns. are ↓ مَرْيِىٌّ and<br>\
↓ مُرَىٌّ, each applied to a banner. (T.)<br>\

in the K, (see 1 in art. رأى, near the end of the<br>\
paragraph,]) but [ISd says,] I hold that this is<br>\
anomalous, and that it is properly only أَرْيَيْتُهَا; I<br>\
stuck, or fixed, [into the ground,] the banner, or<br>\
standard. (M, TA.)<br>\

اِسْتَرْأَيْتُهُ: see رَأَى, first signification.<br>\

Sb on the authority of Abu-l-Khattáb, the ا of<br>\
رَايَةٌ, though a substitute for the medial radical,<br>\
[i. e. ى,] being likened by him to the augmentative ا, and therefore the final radical is made ء,<br>\
like as is done in the case of سِقَآءٌ &amp;c., (M,) A<br>\
banner, or standard, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) of an<br>\
army: (Msb:) accord. to some, (Msb,) originally with ء, [see رَأْيَةٌ, in art. رأى,] though<br>\
pronounced by the Arabs without ء; (T, Msb;)<br>\
but others deny this, and say that it has<br>\
not been heard with ء: (Msb:) pl. رَايَاتٌ (M,<br>\
Msb, K) and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ رَاىٌ. (M, K.) ―<br>\
