رَجْفٌ and رَجَفَانٌ (O, Msb, K) and رَجِيفٌ (Msb,<br>\
K) and رُجُوفٌ; (O, K;) [and ↓ ارجف; (see the<br>\
next sentence;) and ↓ ارتجف; (see نَغَضَ, in two<br>\
places;)] It (a thing, O, Msb) was, or became,<br>\
in a state of motion, commotion, (O, Msb, K,)<br>\
agitation, convulsion, tumult, or disturbance:<br>\
(Msb, K: *) or in a state of violent motion, commotion, agitation, &amp;c.; (K;) as the camel beneath<br>\
the saddle, and the tree when put in motion by<br>\
the wind, and the wabbling tooth, and the like.<br>\
(O.) You say, رَجَفَتِ الأَرْضُ, (S, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\

was, or became, in a state of motion, commotion,<br>\
agitation, &amp;c., (S, O, Msb, K,) as above; (Msb;)<br>\
and so ↓ أَرْجَفَت, and ↓ أُرْجِفَت; (K;) [for ارجف is<br>\
both intrans. and trans.:] and الرَّجَفَانُ signifies<br>\
the being in a state of violent commotion, agitation, convulsion, tumult, or disturbance. (S.)<br>\
And رَجَفَتْ يَدُهُ His arm, or hand, trembled, by<br>\
reason of disease, or old age. (Msb.) And رَجَفَ<br>\
القَلْبُ The heart became agitated by reason of<br>\

into a state of motion, commotion, or agitation;<br>\
(O, K;) [so too, app., رَجَفَ بِهِ;] see 4, last sentence; [and so ↓ أَرْجَفَ; for] أَرْجَفَ الأَرْضَ بِهِمْ is<br>\
said of God [as meaning He made the earth to<br>\
quake with them]. (TA in art. دم.) And one<br>\
says also, رَجَفَتْهُ الحُمَّى The fever caused him to<br>\
quake, or shiver. (Msb.)<br>\

-b2-  [Hence,] ارجف بِكَذَا [originally He<br>\
put another, or others, into a state of commotion,<br>\
or agitation, by such a thing; meaning] he told<br>\
of such a thing without truth, or not according<br>\
to the true, or real, state of the case: [because<br>\
he thereby caused commotion, or agitation; or]<br>\
because the information was unsettled: from رَجْفَةٌ<br>\
meaning as explained below. (Ksh in xxxiii. 60.)<br>\
And ارجفوا فِى الشَّىْءِ (S, Msb, K) and بِهِ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. إِرْجَافٌ, (Msb,) i. q. خَاضُوا فِيهِ [mean-<br>\

and uttered many discordant lying sayings, respecting the thing, in order that the people might<br>\
become in a state of commotion, agitation, convulsion, tumult, or disturbance, in consequence<br>\
thereof: whence, in the Kur [xxxiii. 60],<br>\
فِى المَدِينَةِ ↓ وَالمُرْجِفُونَ [and they who tell many<br>\
evil tales, &amp;c., in the city:] (O, * Msb:) or<br>\
ارجفوا فِى البَلَدِ بِكَذَا they told, in the town, or<br>\
country, of such a matter, in order that they<br>\
might cause commotion, or agitation, &amp;c., to<br>\
befall the people, without there being aught<br>\
[thereof] true in their estimation; from الرَّجَفَانُ<br>\
signifying “ violent commotion or agitation ” &amp;c.<br>\
(Har pp. 218, 219.) And ارجفوا, alone, They<br>\
said what was false (خَاضُوا) in [relating] tales<br>\
of conflicts and factions, or seditions, or discords,<br>\
or dissensions, and the like: whence, ↓ وَالمُرْجِفُونُ<br>\
فِى المَدِينَةِ [cited above]. (K.) ―<br>\

&amp;c.; and particularly an earthquake; or] a violent<br>\
earthquake: and a vehement cry from heaven:<br>\

any punishment that befalls a people. (Lth, O.)<br>\
[<br>\
رَجُوفٌ, accord. to Freytag, occurs in the<br>\
Deewán el-Hudhaleeyeen as meaning Put into a<br>\
state of commotion.] ―<br>\
-b2-  سَحَابٌ رَجُوفٌ Clouds in<br>\
commotion with thunder, or with much water. (O.)<br>\
الرَّجَّافُ The sea; because of its commotion, or<br>\

اَلْمُطْعِمُونَ الشَّحْمَ كُلَّ عَشِيَّةٍ<br>\
حَتَّى تَغِيبَ الشَّمْسُ فِى الرَّجَّافِ<br>\

disappeared in the sea]. (S, O.) ―<br>\

signifies A certain kind of pace [app. with a jolting motion]. (O, K.)<br>\
رَاجِفٌ [Putting into a state of motion, commotion, or agitation. ―<br>\
-b2-  And also, or حُمَّى رَاجِفٌ,]<br>\
A fever attended with quaking, or shivering:<br>\
(O, Msb, K:) deviating from rule [because حُمَّى<br>\
is fem.]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [The fem., with ة, app. applied<br>\
to a she-camel or the like, occurs, accord. to<br>\
Freytag, in the Deewán el-Hudhaleeyeen, as<br>\
meaning Moving the head in going along.]<br>\
الرَّاجِفَةُ, in the Kur lxxix. 6, means The first<br>\
blast [of the horn on the day of resurrection]:<br>\
and الرَّادِفَةُ, in the next verse, “the second blast: ”<br>\
(O, Bd, Jel, K:) or the former means the motionless bodies that shall be in a state of violent motion<br>\
at the time here spoken of, such as the earth and<br>\
the mountains; because of the saying in the Kur<br>\
[lxxiii. 14], يَومَة تَرْجُفُ الْأَرْضُ وَالْجِبَالُ: CCC and the<br>\
latter, “the heaven, and the stars, which shall be<br>\

You say, وَقَعُوا فِى أَرَاجِيفَ [They fell into convulsing perplexities, arising from evil and discordant and false rumours or the like]. (AA, S<br>\
and K in art. تع.)<br>\
المُرْجِفَانِ The basin and ewer (الطَّسْتُ وَالإِبْرِيقُ)<br>\
[that are used for washing the hands before and<br>\
after a meal]: because they produce a sound<br>\
when one of them is knocked against the other:<br>\
as though that sound told of the completion of<br>\
the meal, and excited [the persons that had<br>\
partaken thereof] to rise. (Har p. 228.) ―<br>\
