رَعَظَ, (K,) inf. n. رَعْظٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
made a رُعْظ [q. v.] to it, namely, an arrow; as<br>\
also ↓ ارعظهُ: (K:) or you say, رَعَظَهُ بِالعَقَبِ,<br>\
meaning he wound and bound the sinew upon it,<br>\
namely, an arrow; as also ↓ ارعظهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And He broke its رُعْظ; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K;) as also<br>\
↓ ارعظهُ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  رَعِظَ, aor.<br>\

أَرْعَظَ see 1, in three places.<br>\
رُعْظٌ The socket of the head of an arrow, or<br>\
place into which the head enters, over which are<br>\
the twists of sinew: pl. أَرْعَاظٌ. (Lth, S, K.) It is<br>\
said in a prov., إِنَّ فُلَانًا لَيَكْسِرُ عَلَيْكَ أَرْعَاظَ النَّبْلِ<br>\
[Verily such a one breaks against thee the sockets<br>\
of the heads of the arrows]: applied to him whose<br>\
anger is vehement: as though one said, when he<br>\
takes the arrow, (K, TA,) being vehemently<br>\
angry, (TA,) he strikes the ground with its<br>\
point, in his silent wrath, with such vehemence<br>\
as to break the socket of its head: or it means<br>\
(tropical:)  he grates the teeth at thee, (K, TA,) by reason<br>\
of the vehemence of his anger, so that their sockets<br>\
break; (TA;) the sockets of the dog-teeth being<br>\
thus likened to the sockets of arrow-heads: (K,<br>\
TA:) so in the O and L. (TA.) And it is said<br>\
in another prov., مَا قَدَرْتُ عَلَى كَذَا حَتَّى تَعَطَّفَتْ<br>\
عَلَىَّ أَرْعَاظُ النَّبْلِ [I was not able to do such a<br>\
thing until the sockets of the heads of the arrows<br>\
became much bent against me]. (O, K.)<br>\
رَعِظٌ An arrow having its رُعْظ broken: (S:)<br>\
and [in like manner,] ↓ مَرعُوظٌ an arrow having<br>\
its رُعْظ broken, and being therefore bound with<br>\
sinew: (IB:) or the latter signifies a weak arrow.<br>\
(Aboo-Kheyreh El-&#39;Adawee, Ibn-&#39; Abbád.)<br>\
رَعِيظٌ and ↓ مَرْعُوظٌ An arrow [having a رُعْظ<br>\
made to it: (see 1:) or] having the sinew wound<br>\
and bound upon it. (TA.)<br>\
