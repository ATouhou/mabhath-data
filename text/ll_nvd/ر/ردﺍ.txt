رَدَأَ الحَائِطَ, [aor.<br>\
رَدَاَ, inf. n. رَدْءٌ,] He supported, propped, or stayed, the wall, (ISh, T, K,)<br>\
by means of a piece of timber or wood, or a<br>\
buttress or the like, to prevent its falling; (ISh,<br>\
T;) as also ↓ ارادأهُ: (Yoo, T, K:) or رَدَأَ الحَائِطَ<br>\
بِبِنَآءٍ [he supported the wall by a structure;] he<br>\
attached a structure to the wall. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
(T,) رَدَأَهُ بِهِ He strengthened and supported him,<br>\
or it, by means of it, (Lth, T, M, * K,) namely, a<br>\
person by a thing, (Lth, T,) or a thing by a thing,<br>\
(M,) like as one strengthens and supports a wall<br>\
by means of a structure which he attaches thereto;<br>\
(T;) as also ↓ ارادأهُ. (T, * K.) And رَدَأَهُ, (Mgh,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. رَدْءٌ, (Mgh,) He helped, aided, or<br>\
assisted, him; (Mgh, TA;) as also ↓ اردأهُ: (T, S,<br>\
M, Msb, K:) and رَدَأْتُهُ and ↓ أَرْدَأْتُهُ, (T,) or<br>\
بِنَفْسِى ↓ أَرْدَأْتُهُ, (S,) I was, or became, a helper,<br>\
an aider, or an assistant, to him. (T, S.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Hence also, (i. e., from ردأ الحَائط,) رَدَأَ الإِبِلَ<br>\
(tropical:)  He took good care of the camels, (A, K, TA,)<br>\
in tending and pasturing them. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
رَدَأَهُ بِحَجَرٍ He cast a stone at him; (M, K;)<br>\
like [رَدَاهُ, mentioned in art. ردى, and] دَرَأَهُ. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  رَدُؤَ, aor.<br>\
رَدُاَ, inf. n. رَدَآءَةٌ, (T, S, M, K, &amp;c.,)<br>\
for which one should not say رَدَاوَةٌ; (T;) and Th<br>\
mentions also رَدَأَ and رَدِىءَ as syn. with رَدُؤَ, but<br>\
these are strange; and more strange is what is said<br>\
in the Msb, namely, رَدَا aor. يَرْدُو, part. n. رَدِىٌّ,<br>\
[as a dial. var.,] asserted by IDrst, in the Expos.<br>\
of the Fs, to be erroneous, and peculiar to the<br>\
vulgar; (MF, TA;) It (a thing, T, S, M, Msb,)<br>\
[and he, see رَدِىْءٌ, its part. n.,] was, or became,<br>\
bad, corrupt, vitious, depraved, or the like; (S,<br>\
M, Msb, * K;) or of no rank, or estimation; low,<br>\
ignoble, vile, or mean; (Msb;) [disapproved, disliked, hated, or abominable: (see رَدِىْءٌ:)] and he<br>\
was, or became, weak, and impotent, so as to be<br>\
in want or need. (TA from the Expositions of<br>\
the Fs.)<br>\
2<br>\
رَدَّاَ see the next paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
اردأهُ: see 1, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He<br>\
settled, established, or confirmed, him, or it, (K,<br>\
TA,) in his, or its, state. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He stilled, or<br>\
quieted, him, or it. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And He let it down;<br>\
namely, a veil, or curtain. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also He<br>\
rendered it bad, corrupt, vitious, depraved, or the<br>\
like; (S, K;) namely, a thing; said of a man;<br>\
(S;) [and ↓ ردّآهُ is used in the same sense: (see<br>\
1 in art. جشب:)] he made, or asserted, or held,<br>\
it (a thing) to be رَدِىء [or bad, &amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And اردأ signifies He did a thing, or a deed, that<br>\
was رَدِىْء [or bad, &amp;c.]: or he met with, or experienced, (أَصَابَ,) a thing that was رَدِىْء. (M,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A3-  اردأ عَلَى غَيْرِهِ It exceeded another thing;<br>\
as also أَرْدَى: (M:) [or the latter only:] accord.<br>\
to IAar, one says اردأ عَلَى السِّتِّينَ, with ء, (M,)<br>\
and, accord. to Lth, على الخَمْسِينَ, (TA,) and,<br>\
[accord. to F,] على مِائَةٍ, (K,) meaning He exceeded [the age of sixty, and fifty, and a hundred]:<br>\
(M, K, TA:) but Az says that اردأ, with ء, [in<br>\
these phrases,] though authorized by Lth, is<br>\
wrong; (TA;) and accord. to A&#39; Obeyed, one<br>\
says أَرْدَيْتُ. (M. [It is added, however, in the<br>\
M, that اردأ may perhaps be also used in poetry<br>\
in the same sense without the prep. على.])<br>\
5<br>\
تَرَدَّؤُوا They helped, aided, or assisted, one<br>\
another. (Lth, M, TA.)<br>\
رِدْءٌ A buttress, or the like, by means of which<br>\
a wall is strengthened and supported. (T.) [This<br>\
is the primary signification. See also رِدٌّ, in art.<br>\
رد.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Or] the primary meaning is A thing by<br>\
means of which one is helped, aided, or assisted;<br>\
such as the دِفْء [or thing by which one is<br>\
rendered warm, or protected from the cold wind].<br>\
(Bd in xxviii. 34; where it has the meaning next<br>\
following, as is said in the T and S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A helper,<br>\
an aider, or an assistant. (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K.) You say, فُلَانٌ رِدْءٌ لِفُلَانٍ Such a one is an<br>\
aider and a strengthener to such a one. (T.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And i. q. مَادَّةٌ [app. as meaning An accession; or<br>\
a thing that is added, whatever it be, to another<br>\
thing]. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (tropical:)  i. q. عِدْلٌ [i. e. A burden<br>\
that balances another burden on the other side of<br>\
a beast]; (T, TA;) so called because one such<br>\
ردء supports another: (TA:) and a heavy عِدْل:<br>\
(T, K, TA:) pl. أَرْدَآءٌ. (T, TA.)<br>\
رِدَآءٌ: see art. ردى.<br>\
رَدِىْءٌ, applied to a thing, (T, S, M, Msb,) and<br>\
to a man, (M, TA,) Bad, corrupt, vitious, depraved, or the like; (S, M, Msb, * K;) of no<br>\
rank, or estimation; low, ignoble, vile, or mean;<br>\
(Msb;) disapproved, disliked, hated, or abominable: and weak, and impotent, so as to be in<br>\
want or need: and accord to the Msb, one says<br>\
also رَدِىٌّ; [there said to be a dial. var.;] but this<br>\
is asserted by IDrst, in the Expos. of the Fs, to<br>\
be erroneous, and peculiar to the vulgar: (TA:)<br>\
pl. أَرْدِئَآءُ, with two hemzehs, (M, K,) applied to<br>\
a people, or company of men. (M.)<br>\
[<br>\
أَرْدَأُ Worse, and worst; more, and most, corrupt &amp;c.]<br>\
مِرْدَأَةٌ A stone which a strong man can hardly<br>\
lift with both his hands; (TA;) as also مِرْدَاةٌ.<br>\
