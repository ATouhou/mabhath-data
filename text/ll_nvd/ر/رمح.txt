inf. n., (TA,) He kicked him; (K;) or struck<br>\
him with his hind leg, (S, A, TA,) or with both<br>\

not expressed.])<br>\
رُمْحٌ A certain weapon, (L, TA,) well known;<br>\
(L, Msb, K;) [i. e. a spear, or lance; one with<br>\
which one thrusts, not which one casts; accord.<br>\
to El-Hareeree, (cited by De Sacy in his “ Chrest.<br>\
Ar,” sec. ed., ii. 332,) not so called unless having<br>\
its iron head mounted upon it:] pl. رِمَاحٌ and<br>\
أَرْمَاحٌ, (S, L, Msb, K,) the former of mult. and<br>\
the latter of pauc. (L.) [Hence the saying,]<br>\
كَسَرُوا بَيْنَهُمْ رُمْحًا [lit. They broke a spear between<br>\
them, or among them; meaning] (tropical:)  evil, or mischief, [or enmity, or contention,] happened between them, or among them. (A, TA.) And<br>\

بَنِى فُلَانٍ رُمْحٌ وَاحِدٌ (tropical:)  [They are in league against<br>\
the sons of such a one as one man]. (A, TA.)<br>\
And كَأَنَّ عَيْنَيْهِ فِى رُمْحَيْنِ [As though his two<br>\
eyes were upon two spears] is said of one in fear<br>\
and fright, and looking hardly, or intently; and<br>\

سَعْدٍ (assumed tropical:)  He (a man, K, TA, or an old man, TA)<br>\
stayed himself upon a staff by reason of extreme<br>\
old age, or decrepitude: by ابوسعد is meant<br>\
Lukmán the Sage, (K, TA,) who is mentioned<br>\
in the Kur-án: (TA:) or Marthad Ibn-Saad:<br>\
or it is a surname applied to old age, and decrepitude. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also رَامِحٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  [As a measure in astronomy, accord. to modern Arabian<br>\
astronomers, it is Four degrees and a half; the<br>\
eightieth part of a great circle; and accord. to<br>\
various works on practical law, it consists of<br>\
twelve أَشْبَار (or spans): but there is reason to<br>\
believe that ancient usage differed from the<br>\
modern, with respect to both these measures, and<br>\
was not precise nor uniform: in an instance mentioned voce زُبَانَى, it appears to be about twice<br>\
the measure stated above; i. e., about nine degrees;<br>\
and to consist of five cubits, a measure perhaps<br>\
equal to twelve spans.] ―<br>\
-b4-  أَخَذَتْ رِمَاحَهَا, said of<br>\
the [species of barley-grass called] بُهْمَى, (T, S,<br>\
A, TA,) and of any similar pasture, (T, TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  It assumed, or put forth, its prickles, (A, * TA,)<br>\
or became dry in its prickles, (T, TA,) and thus<br>\
(T, A, TA) resisted the attempts of animals to<br>\
pasture upon it. (T, S, A, L, TA.) Also, said of<br>\
camels, (tropical:)  They became fat, (S, K, TA,) or yielded<br>\
milk plentifully; (S, TA;) as though they prevented one&#39;s slaughtering them; (K;) or because<br>\
their owner is prevented from slaughtering them:<br>\
(S:) or they became goodly in the eye of their<br>\
owner so that he was prevented from slaughtering<br>\
them; (A, * TA;) and so أَخَذَتْ أَسْلِحَتَهَا. (TA.)<br>\
One says also نَاقَةٌ ذَاتُ رُمْحٍ (tropical:)  A fat she-camel;<br>\
and إِبِلٌ ذَوَاتُ رِمَاحٍ (tropical:)  fat camels; because their<br>\
owner, when desiring to slaughter them, looks at<br>\
their fatness and their goodly appearance, and is<br>\
prevented from slaughtering them. (A, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
رِمَاحُ الجِنِّ (tropical:)  [The pestilence termed] الطَّاعُونُ.<br>\
(A, K.) [See the following verses.] ―<br>\
-b6-  رِمَاحُ<br>\
العَقْرَبِ i. q. شَوْلَاهَا [evidently a mistranscription for<br>\
شَوْلَاتُهَا, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The stings of scorpions, with which<br>\
they strike; العقرب being here used, as it seems<br>\
to be in some other instances, as a coll. gen. n.:<br>\
that such is the case is shown by the verses here<br>\
following, quoted in the TA as an ex. of رِمَاحُ<br>\
الجِنِّ]. (K.) A poet, cited by Th, says,<br>\
لَعَمْرُكَ مَا خَشِيتُ عَلَى أُبَىٍّ<br>\
رِمَاحَ بَنِى مُقَيِّدَةِ الحِمَارِ<br>\
وَلٰكِنِّى خَشِيتُ عَلَى أُبَىٍّ<br>\
رِمَاحَ الجِنِّ أَوْ إِيَّاكَ حَارِ<br>\
[By thy life, or by thy religion, I feared not, for<br>\
Ubeí, the stings of the scorpions; but I feared,<br>\
for Ubeí, the pestilence, or thee, O Harith; حَارِ<br>\
being for حَارِثُ]; by بنى مقيّدة الحمار he means<br>\
the scorpions. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [The dim.] ↓ رُمَيْحٌ is a<br>\
proper name of (assumed tropical:)  The penis; (K, * TA;) like as<br>\
شُرَيْحٌ is a proper name for “ the vulva of a<br>\
woman. ” (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  ↓ ذُو الرُّمَيْحِ means (assumed tropical:)  A species<br>\
of jerboa, (K, TA,) long in the hind legs, in the<br>\
middle [?] of each وَظِيف [here meaning metacarpus] having a nail in excess [of those of the<br>\
hind feet; for the fore feet have each five toes of<br>\
which one only has no nail, and the hind feet have<br>\
each but three toes, all of which have nails]: or<br>\
it means any jerboa: and its رمح [evidently a<br>\
mistranscription for رُمَيْح] is its tail. (TA. [It<br>\
is there added, ورماحه شولاتها; another mistranscription, and an obvious solecism; or probably<br>\
some words which should have preceded these<br>\
have been omitted by the copyist.])<br>\
رَمْحَةٌ: see رَمَّاحٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also the paragraph<br>\
here following.<br>\
رِمَاحٌ a pl. of رُمْحٌ. (S &amp;c.)<br>\
-A2-  Also [The vice<br>\
of kicking, or striking with the hind leg or with<br>\
both the hind legs;] a subst. from رَمَحَ said of any<br>\
solid-hoofed animal: (Msb, TA:) it is a vice for<br>\
which an animal that has been sold may be returned. (TA.) One says, هُوَ ذُو رِمَاحٍ [He has a<br>\
vice of kicking]. (A.) And أَبْرَأُ إِلَيْكَ مِنَ الجِمَاحِ<br>\
وَالرَّمَاحِ [I am irresponsible to thee for the vice of<br>\
overcoming the rider and running away with him,<br>\
and the vice of kicking]. (TA.) [And ↓ رَمْحَةٌ,<br>\
in like manner, signifies A trick of kicking: see<br>\
an ex. voce جَمْحَةٌ.]<br>\
رَمُوحٌ and ↓ رَمَّاحٌ [A horse, or the like, that has<br>\
a habit of kicking]. You say دَابَّةٌ رَمُوحٌ عَضُوضٌ<br>\
and عَضَّاضَةٌ ↓ رَمَّاحَةٌ, [A kicking, biting, beast].<br>\
(A.) And نَاقَةٌ رَمُوحٌ (tropical:)  A kicking she-camel.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رُمَيْحٌ: see رُمْحٌ, [of which it is the dim.], in<br>\
three places.<br>\

-A2-  See also رَمُوحٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
قَوْسٌ رَمَّاحَةٌ A bow that propels [the arrow] vehemently. (K.) The word رمّاحة used [app. in this<br>\
sense, without a subst.,] by Tufeyl El-Ghanawee<br>\
is expl. by some as meaning A thrust, or piercing,<br>\
with the رُمْح; but no way of resolving this is<br>\
known, unless it be used in the place of ↓ رَمْحَةٌ,<br>\
as the inf. n. of un. of رَمَحَ. (L.)<br>\
-A3-  Also<br>\
(tropical:)  Poverty, need, or want. (K, TA. [This meaning is erroneously assigned in Freytag&#39;s Lex. to<br>\
رُمْحٌ.])<br>\
رَامِحٌ Thrusting, or piercing, another with a<br>\
رُمْح [i. e. spear, or lance]. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
(S [in the Msb “ or ”]) A man having a رُمْح<br>\
[spear, or lance]; (S, Msb, K;) and so ↓ رَمَّاحٌ:<br>\
(L:) the former an epithet [of the possessive<br>\
kind,] similar to لَابِنٌ and تَامِرٌ, having no verb.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  السِّمَاكُ الرَّامِحُ is the name of (tropical:)  [The star<br>\
Arcturus;] a certain star, before, or preceding,<br>\
الفَكَّة [or Corona Borealis], preceded by another<br>\
star, [the star<br>\
η in the left leg of Bootes,] which<br>\
is called its ↓ رُمْح [or spear, i. e. رُمْحُ السِّمَاكِ<br>\
and simply الرُّمْحُ], (S, K,) whence its name:<br>\
it is one of two stars which are together called<br>\
السِّمَاكَانِ; and is not one of the Mansions of the<br>\
Moon: (S:) it is also called السِّمَاكُ المِرْزَمُ:<br>\
(Az, TA:) the other سماك [is Spica Virginis,<br>\
the Fourteenth Mansion of the Moon, and] is<br>\
called الأَعْزَلُ, because it has no star [near] before<br>\
it: الرامح is more red. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  رَامِحٌ also signifies (tropical:)  A bull; so called because of his pair of<br>\
horns: (A:) [i. e.] a wild bull; thought by ISd<br>\
to be so called because of his horn: (TA:) or<br>\
