رَتَجَ, inf. n. رَتْجٌ: see 4.<br>\
-A2-  رَتِجَ, (K,) or<br>\
رَتِجَ فِى مَنْطِقَهِ, (S, A, Msb,) aor.<br>\
رَتَجَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. رَتَجٌ, (Msb, TA,) (tropical:)  He was, or became,<br>\
impeded in his speech, unable to speak, or tonguetied; (S, A, * Msb, K;) as also عَلَيْهِ ↓ أُرْتِجَ, (A,<br>\
K,) and عليه ↓ اُرْتُتِجَ, and عليه ↓ اُسْتُرْتِجَ. (K.)<br>\
You say, عَلَى القَارِىءِ ↓ أُرْتِجَ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) and<br>\
على الخَطِيبِ, (Mgh,) (tropical:)  The reader, or reciter,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb,) and the orator, or preacher,<br>\

like as a door is closed; (S;) or was, or became,<br>\
impeded in his reading, or recitation, and his<br>\
oration, or sermon, and unable to complete it;<br>\
(Mgh;) from أَرْتَجَ البَابَ: (Mgh, Msb: [see 4:])<br>\
and عَلَيْهِ ↓ اُرْتُتِجَ signifies the same: (S: [in my<br>\
copy of the Msb, “ارتيج, of the same measure as<br>\
اقتيل, in the pass. form: ” but this is evidently a<br>\
mistranscription, for اُرْتُتِجَ, of the same measure<br>\
as اُقْتُتِلَ:]) one should not say اُرْتُجَّ عليه: (S:<br>\
[but it seems that those who pronounced the verb<br>\
with teshdeed said اِرْتَجَّ: see art. رج:]) this is<br>\
sometimes said; but some disallow it: (Msb:)<br>\
the vulgar say it; and accord. to some, it may be<br>\
correct as meaning “ he fell into confusion. ”<br>\
(Mgh.) You say also, عَلَيْهِ ↓ صَعِدَ المِنْبَرَ فَأُرْتِجَعَلَى<br>\

إِرْتَاجٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ رَتَجَهُ, (K,) inf. n. رَتْجٌ;<br>\
but As allows only the former verb; (TA;) i. q.<br>\
أَغْلَقَهُ, [which means He locked the door, and<br>\
also he shut, or closed, the door, but the former<br>\
appears to be the signification here intended,<br>\
from what follows,] (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) so as<br>\
to make it fast, or firm: (A, Mgh, Msb:) so<br>\
says Az, after Lth: and, by extension of the<br>\
signification, he shut, or closed, the door, without<br>\
locking it. (Mgh.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّ أَبْوَابَ<br>\

opened at the declining of the sun from the<br>\
meridian,] and are not closed nor locked [until<br>\
the noon-prayer has been performed]. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] أُرْتِجَ عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرُ (assumed tropical:)  The affair was as<br>\
though it were closed against him, so that he<br>\
