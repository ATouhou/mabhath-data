ارقلت, said of a palm-tree (نَخْلَة), inf. n.<br>\
إِرْقَالٌ, It became such as is termed رَقْلَة [q. v.].<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ارقل, (S, K,) said of a he-camel, (S,)<br>\
or ارقلت, said of a she-camel, (JK, Msb, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. as above, (JK, S, Msb,) He, or she, went<br>\
quickly; (JK, K;) went a sort of quick pace;<br>\
(Msb;) went a sort of pace of the kind termed<br>\
خَبَب [q. v.]: (S, TA:) or went a sort of run<br>\
exceeding that termed خَبَب: (TA:) and ↓ رَقَلَتْ<br>\
signifies the same as ارقلت. (JK.) ارقل is also<br>\
said of a man, (S, K,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  He went<br>\
quickly. (TA.) And you say, ارقلوا فِى الحَرْبِ,<br>\
(TA,) or إِلَى الحَرْبِ, (JK,) (tropical:)  They went quickly<br>\
in, or to, war, or battle. (JK, TA.) And فُلَانٌ<br>\
يُرْقِلُ فِى الأُمُورِ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one is quick in affairs].<br>\
(TA.) And أَرْقَلَتْ إِلَيْهِ is metaphorically said, by<br>\
Aboo-Heiyeh En-Numeyree, of spears [as meaning (tropical:)  They had been quickly directed towards<br>\
him]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Accord. to Lth and the K, ارقل<br>\
also signifies He traversed, or crossed, a desert:<br>\
and Lth cites the following verse of El-&#39;Ajjáj [as<br>\
his authority for this explanation]:<br>\
لَاهُمَّ رَبِّ البَيْتِ وَالمُشَرَّقِ<br>\
وَالمُرْقِلَاتِ كُلَّ سُهْبٍ سَمْلَقِ<br>\
but Az says that this is a mistake of Lth; that<br>\
كُلَّ is here an adv. n.; and that the meaning is,<br>\
[O God, by the Lord of the House (of Mekkeh)<br>\
and of the Musharrak (the mosque of El-Kheyf)<br>\
and] by the Lord of the swift she-camels in every<br>\
even plain: and ISd also has notified the same.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

رَقْلَةٌ A tall palm-tree: (S, Msb:) or a palmtree exceeding the reach of the hand; (K, * TA;)<br>\

accord. to As, has this meaning; and the former<br>\
word, a palm-tree higher than such as [just]<br>\
exceeds the reach of the hand: (TA:) or a palmtree of which the trunk has become such as that<br>\
one may reach [the fruit] from [the top of] it:<br>\
(JK:) pl. رِقَالٌ (JK, S, Msb, K) and رَقَلَاتٌ<br>\
(Msb) and ↓ رَقْلٌ, (K,) or [rather] of this last it<br>\
is a n. un. (Msb.) Hence the prov.,<br>\
وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ بِالدَّخْلِ  ↓تَرَى الفِتْيَانَ كَالرَّقْلِ<br>\
[Thou seest the youths, or young men, like tall<br>\
palm-trees, &amp;c.; but what will acquaint thee with<br>\
the vice, &amp;c., that is, or may be, in them?]. (TA.<br>\
[See also another reading of this verse voce<br>\
دَخْلٌ.]) [And رَوَاقِلُ, pl. of ↓ رَاقِلٌ, as used by a<br>\
Hudhalee poet, applied to the trunks of palmtrees, signifies Tall. (“ Abulfedæ Annales,”<br>\
vol. i. page 494.)]<br>\
رَاقِلٌ; pl. رَوَاقِلُ: see what next precedes.<br>\
