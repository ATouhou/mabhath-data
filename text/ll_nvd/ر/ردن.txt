رَدڤنَ [رَدَنَتْ, aor. app.<br>\
رَدُنَ, but accord. to Freytag<br>\
رَدِنَ, inf. n. رَدْنٌ, She (a woman) spun thread with<br>\
the مِرْدَن: see رَدَنٌ:] الرَّدْنُ and الغَزْلُ are nearly<br>\
the same [in meaning]. (Ham p. 218. [Hence<br>\
مَرْدُونٌ applied to spun thread.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And app.<br>\
She wove a garment, or piece of cloth, with spun<br>\
thread such as is termed مَرْدُونٌ, or رَدَنٌ: whence<br>\
مَرْدُونٌ applied to such a garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth.] ―<br>\
-b3-  The vulgar say of him who is drowsing,<br>\
drowsy, or heavy with sleep, عَيْنُهُ تردنُ وَتَغْزِلُ<br>\
[perhaps تَرْدِنُ, to assimilate it to تَغْزِلُ, app.<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  His eye blinks, twinkles, or moves its<br>\
lids to and for; like the hand that spins thread in<br>\
two different directions, or that throws the shuttle<br>\
to and fro]. (Ham ubi suprà.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And رَدَنْتُ<br>\
المَتَاعَ, (S,) aor.<br>\
رَدُنَ, (JM, PS,) inf. n. رَدْنٌ, (S,<br>\
K,) I put the goods, household-goods, or commodities, one upon another; or put them, or set<br>\
them, together, in regular order, or piled up.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  رَدْنٌ also signifies The making, or<br>\
causing, to smoke. (K.) You say, رَدَنَ النَّارَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
رَدِنَ, inf. n. رَدْنٌ, He made, or caused, the fire<br>\
to smoke. (TK.)<br>\
-A3-  رَدِنَ جِلْدُهُ, (S, K, *) aor.<br>\
رَدَنَ,<br>\
inf. n. رَدَنٌ, (S,) His skin became contracted,<br>\
shrunk, or wrinkled. (S, K. *)<br>\
2<br>\
رَدَّنَ see what next follows.<br>\
4<br>\
اردن القَمِيصَ He put, or made, a رُدْن [q.<br>\
v.] to the shirt; as also ↓ ردّنهُ, (S, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَرْدِينٌ: (S:) or he put, or made, أَرْدَان [pl. of<br>\
رُدْن] to the shirt. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  اردنت عَلَيْهِ الحُمَّى<br>\
i. q. اردمت [i. e. The fever continued upon him].<br>\
(S: in some copies of which, as in the TA, عليه<br>\
is omitted.)<br>\
8<br>\
ارتدنت She (a woman, TA) took to herself,<br>\
or made, a مِرْدَن [q. v.], (K, TA,) for spinning.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
Q. Q. 1<br>\
رَوْدَنَ, (K,) inf. n. رَوْدَنَةٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
was, or became, fatigued, tired, weary, or jaded,<br>\
(K, TA,) and weak, or feeble. (TA.)<br>\
رَدْنٌ The sound of the falling [or clashing] of<br>\
weapons, one upon another. (S, K.)<br>\
رُدْنٌ The base (أَصْل) of the sleeve: (S, K:)<br>\
[app. meaning the part thereof that is next to the<br>\
shoulder: but see what follows:] the fore part of<br>\
the sleeve of the shirt: (M:) or the lower part<br>\
thereof: (M, and Har pp. 149 and 390:) or the<br>\
sleeve altogether: (M:) and it may tropically<br>\
mean the whole garment: (Har p. 390:) pl.<br>\
أَرْدَانٌ. (S, M, K. [In the TA is added, and<br>\
اردنة; as though another pl. were أَرْدِنَةٌ: but I<br>\
think that this is a mistake, originating in a copy<br>\
of the M; for, immediately after أَرْدَانٌ, in the M,<br>\
is added, وَأَرْدَنَهُ جَعَلَ لَهُ أَرْدَانًا; and I suspect that<br>\
in some copy thereof, واردنه has been inadvertently written twice.]) You say قَمِيصٌ وَاسِعُ الرُّدْنِ<br>\
[A shirt wide in the ردن]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
one says, هُوَ دَنِسُ الأَرْدَانِ (tropical:)  [meaning He is foul<br>\
in character, conduct, or the like; for it is tropical]. (A in art. دنس. [See, there, other similar<br>\
phrases.])<br>\
-A2-  See also رُدَيْنِىٌّ.<br>\
-A3-  [Also pl. of<br>\
أَرْدَنُ, q. v.]<br>\
رَدَنُ Spun thread: (Sh, T, S, K:) or spun<br>\
thread that is not even: (T:) or thread spun [by<br>\
moving the hand] forwards [upon the spindle<br>\
against the thigh]: or spun thread that is مَنْكُوس<br>\
[i. e. twisted in a manner the reverse of that<br>\
which is usual: see شَزْرٌ]: thread spun with the<br>\
مِرْدَن. (M. [See مَرْدُونٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [Cloth of<br>\
the kind termed] خَزّ: (AA, T, S, M, K, and<br>\
Ham p. 218:) or yellow خَزّ: (AA, T:) or what<br>\
is woven from what women spin with the مِرْدَن<br>\
(مما تردنه النساء): (Ham ubi suprà: [see, again,<br>\
مَرْدُونٌ:]) or silk; i. q. قَزٌّ; (M;) or حَرِيرٌ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And The [membrane called] غِرْس [q. v.] that<br>\
comes forth with the young (S, K, TA) from the<br>\
belly of its mother. (TA.) The Arabs say,<br>\
هٰذَا مِدْرَعُ الرَّدَنِ [This is the غِرْس]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
See also رَادِنٌ.<br>\
رُمْحٌ رُدَيْنِىٌّ [meaning A well-straightened spear;<br>\
lit. a spear of Rudeyneh]: and قَنَاةٌ رُدَيْنِيَّةٌ [the<br>\
same, or a well-straightened spear-shaft]: (S:)<br>\
and رِمَاحٌ رُدَيْنِيَّةٌ [well-straightened spears]: (M:)<br>\
accord. to their [the Arabs&#39;] assertion, (S,) so<br>\
called in relation to a woman named Rudeyneh,<br>\
(S, M,) wife of Es-Semharee [or Semhar]; both<br>\
of whom used to straighten spears, or spear-shafts,<br>\
in Khatt-Hejer: and some say ↓ خَطِّيَّةٌ رُدْنٌ [wellstraightened spears of El-Khatt], and رِمَاحٌ رُدْنٌ.<br>\
(S.) [See an ex. in a verse cited in art. ذوق,<br>\
6th conj.]<br>\
رَادِنٌ Saffron; (S, K;) as also ↓ رَدَنٌ. (Sgh,<br>\
TA in art. شعر.)<br>\
أَحْمَرُ رَادِنِىٌّ A camel, (As, T,) or a thing, (S,)<br>\
of which the redness is mixed with yellowness,<br>\
(As, T, S, K,) like وَرْس [q. v.]: (As, T:) hence<br>\
the epithet رَادِنِىٌّ is applied to a he-camel, (S,<br>\
TA,) and with ة to a she-camel: (As, T, S:) or<br>\
رَادِنِىٌّ is applied to a he-camel as meaning having<br>\
crisp, or curly, fur, of generous race, (Lth, T,<br>\
M,) beautiful, (Lth, T,) and inclining a little to<br>\
blackness: (Lth, T, M:) or intensely red; (TA,<br>\
and Ham p. 218;) or it has this meaning also:<br>\
(M:) or between yellow and red: accord. to some,<br>\
from رَادِنٌ signifying “ saffron; ” (Ham ubi suprà;)<br>\
but As says, I know not in relation to what thing<br>\
the camel is called by this epithet. (M.) They<br>\
said also أَرْمَكُ رَادِنِىٌّ [i. e. Intensely dun or brown<br>\
or dusky &amp;c.]; to denote intensiveness; like as<br>\
they said أَبْيَضُ نَاصِعٌ. (IAar, M.)<br>\
أَرْدَنُ [or خَزٌّ أَرْدَنُ] A sort of [cloth of the kind<br>\
termed] خَزّ, (S, K,) red: (S:) [pl. رُدْنٌ:] and<br>\
[hence] ثِيَابٌ رُدْنٌ Red garments or cloths. (So<br>\
in one of my copies of the S.)<br>\
أُرْدُنٌ, (ISK, T, S, M, and so in some copies of<br>\
the K,) in some of the copies of the K erroneously<br>\
said to be with the ر musheddedeh, (TA,) [in the<br>\
CK with the د, which is also a mistake,] A<br>\
drowsiness, or dozing: (S, K:) or an overpowering<br>\
drowsiness or dozing: a poet uses the phrase<br>\
نَعْسَةٌ أُرْدُنٌّ: (ISk, T:) or this means an intense<br>\
drowsiness or dozing: (M:) Yákoot says that it<br>\
appears to signify intenseness and an overpowering, because there is no meaning in one&#39;s saying<br>\
نَعْسَةٌ نَعْسَةٌ. (TA.) It is a word of which no<br>\
verb has been heard. (S.) Hence, accord. to ISK,<br>\
الأُرْدُنُّ as the name of a certain province; (T;) a<br>\
province of Syria, (S, K,) and a river thereof<br>\
[i. e. the Jordan]; (S;) also without teshdeed.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُرْدِنٌ Dark; (S, M, K;) applied to night.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, applied to sweat, Stinking: (K:)<br>\
or, thus applied, that wets all the skin: (M:)<br>\
[or] ↓ مَرْدُونٌ has the latter meaning, thus applied. (T.)<br>\
مِرْدَنٌ A spindle (S, M, K) with which [the<br>\
thread termed] رَدَن is spun: (M, TA:) pl. مَرَادِنُ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَرْدُونٌ is applied as an epithet to غَزْل [i. e.<br>\
spun thread, meaning Spun with the مِرْدَن: see<br>\
also رَدَنٌ]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also to a garment, or piece<br>\
of cloth, (M,) meaning Woven (Sh, T, M) with<br>\
spun thread that is مَرْدُون. (M.) Aboo-Duwád<br>\
El-Iyádee says,<br>\
أَسْأَدَتْ لَيْلَةً وَيَوْمًا فَلَمَّا<br>\
دَخَلَتْ فِى مُسَرْبَخٍ مَرْدُونِ<br>\
[She (app. referring to a camel) hastened in her<br>\
journey, or journeyed on without stopping to rest,<br>\
a night and a day; and when she entered a<br>\
desert, or waterless desert, far-extending, wide,<br>\
or spacious, woven with the mirage, or overspread by a rippling mirage resembling a web:<br>\
or they (i. e. camels) hastened &amp;c.]: Sh says that<br>\
مَرْدُون signifies woven: and the poet means, by<br>\
مسربخ مردون, a tract of land in which was the<br>\
mirage: (T:) or مردون here means woven with<br>\
the mirage: (TA in art. سربخ:) or, as some say,<br>\
by مردون he means مَرْدُوم, [app. as signifying<br>\
conjoined, so as to be uninterrupted, (see رَدَمَ,)]<br>\
and has changed the م into ن; and مسربخ<br>\
means wide, or spacious: (T:) or مردون signifies<br>\
مَوْصُول [which has the meaning that I have<br>\
assigned above to مردوم]: (T, K:) so some say.<br>\
(T.) ―<br>\
