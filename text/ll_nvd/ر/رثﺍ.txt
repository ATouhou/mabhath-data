رَثَأَ, (S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
رَثَاَ, (M, K,) inf. n. رَثْءٌ,<br>\
(S, M,) He drew milk from the udder upon sour<br>\
milk, so that it thickened, (S, K,) and became<br>\
what is termed رَثِيْئَة: (K:) or he mixed fresh<br>\
milk with sour milk: or, as some say, he made<br>\
milk to become what is termed رَثِيْئَة: (M:) or it<br>\
has this last signification, and also signifies he<br>\
mixed [in an absolute sense]. (K.) [Az says,]<br>\
I heard an Arab of the desert, of Benoo-Mudarris,<br>\
say to a servant of his, اِرْثَأْ لِى لُبَيْنَةً أَشْرَبُهَا [Mix<br>\
thou for me a little milk so as to make رَثِيْئَة, which<br>\
I will drink]. (T.) And you say, رَثَأَ القَوْمَ (M,<br>\
K) and رَثَأَ لَهُمْ (M) He made for the party<br>\
رَثِيْئَة. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] هُمْ يَرْثَؤُونَ رَأْيَهُمْ, (S,)<br>\
and رَثَؤُوا رَأْيَهُمْ, (M,) inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  They<br>\
confuse, or confound, and they confused, or confounded, their judgment, or opinion. (S, M.<br>\
[See also 8.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence also, perhaps, as<br>\
رثيئة is said to be beaten with a مِجْدَح in the<br>\
mixing of it,] He beat (K) with a staff, or stick.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  It (anger) became stilled, or appeased.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
-A3-  He (a camel) became affected with the<br>\
disease termed رَثْأَة. (K.)<br>\
-A4-  Also, (M, K,) inf. n.<br>\
as above, (M,) a dial. var. of رَثَى, meaning He<br>\
eulogized a man after his death [in verse or<br>\
otherwise; or he wept for him, or over him,<br>\
enumerating his good qualities or actions]: (M,<br>\
K: *) and in like manner one says of a woman<br>\
eulogizing her husband after his death; inf. n.<br>\
مَرْثِئَةٌ: (M:) ISk mentions an Arab woman&#39;s<br>\
saying رَثَأْتُ زَوْجِى بِأَبْيَاتٍ [I eulogized my husband<br>\
after his death with verses]; pronouncing the<br>\
verb with ء; but it is originally without ء: (S,<br>\
Sgh:) Fr says that her doing this arose from her<br>\
finding them to say رَثَأْتُ اللَّبَنَ and her therefore<br>\
supposing المَرْثِيَة to be from the same source:<br>\
(TA in the present art.:) or, accord. to Fr, their<br>\
chasteness of speech sometimes induced them to<br>\
pronounce with ء that which is [properly] without ء; and thus they said رَثَأْتُ المَيِّتَ and لَبَّأْتُ<br>\
بِالحَجِّ and حَلَّأْتُ السَّوِيقَ. (TA in art. رثو.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَرْثَاَ see the next paragraph.<br>\

ارتثأ It (milk) thickened, or became thick:<br>\
(S, K:) and so ↓ ارثأ, (M, K,) in some one or<br>\
more of the dialects. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ارتثأ<br>\
عَلَيْهِمْ أَمْرُهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  Their case, or affair, became confused to them. (S, M.) And ارتثأ فِى رَأْيِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
made a confusion in his judgment, or opinion.<br>\
(S, K.) And هُمْ يَرْتَثِئُونَ أَمْرَهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [app. for فِى<br>\
أَمْرِهِمْ, and thus meaning They are confused, or<br>\
they make a confusion, in their case, or affair:<br>\
or, otherwise, they confuse their case, or affair]:<br>\
from الرَّثِيْئَة; (T, TA;) and if so, tropical. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also He drank what is termed رَثِيْئَة. (T, K.)<br>\
رَثْءٌ: see رَثْأَةٌ.<br>\
رُثْءٌ: see رُثْأَةٌ.<br>\
رَثْأَةٌ, (M, TA,) or ↓ رَثْءٌ, (K, [probably a<br>\
mistranscription,]) (assumed tropical:)  Littleness of intelligence or<br>\
sagacity: (M, K:) and (assumed tropical:)  weakness of heart:<br>\
(M, TA:) and (assumed tropical:)  foolishness, or stupidity; (K;)<br>\
and so ↓ رَثِيْئَةٌ (Th, M, K) and ↓ مَرْثَأٌ. (TA in art.<br>\
وأب.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, perhaps, (TA,) the first of these<br>\
words (رَثْأَةٌ) signifies [also] (assumed tropical:)  A certain disease in<br>\
a camel&#39;s shoulder-joint, (K,) in consequence of<br>\
which he limps. (TA.)<br>\
رُثْأَةٌ, (M, TA,) or ↓ رُثْءٌ, (K, [probably a mistranscription,]) Blackness mixed with speckles of<br>\
white; or the reverse: syn. رُقْطَةٌ. (M, K.)<br>\
رَثِيْئَةٌ Sour milk upon which fresh milk is drawn<br>\
from the udder, so that it becomes thick: (Lh,<br>\
S, M, K:) or fresh milk poured upon sour, (As,<br>\
T, M, Mgh,) and then stirred about with a<br>\
[wooden instrument called] مِجْدَح until it becomes thick: (Lh, M:) or fresh milk upon which<br>\
sour milk is poured, then left a while, whereupon<br>\
thin yellow water [or whey] comes forth, and is<br>\
poured away from it, and then the thick is drunk.<br>\
(Har p. 451.) One says, الرَّثِيْئَةُ تَفْثَأُ الغَضَبَ (S,<br>\
TA) What is termed رثيئة stills, or appeases,<br>\
anger: (TA:) alluding to [the effect produced<br>\
by] a small kindness: a saying which originated<br>\
from a man&#39;s being incensed against some persons.<br>\
and being hungry, and their giving him to drink<br>\
some رثيئة, whereupon his anger became appeased:<br>\
(S in art. فثأ:) hence it became a proverb. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also رَثْأَةٌ.<br>\
أَرْثَأُ, fem. رَثْآءُ, A ram, and a ewe, black speckled<br>\
with white; or the reverse: syn. أَرْقَطُ, and رَقْطَآءُ.<br>\
(M, K.)<br>\
مَرْثَأٌ: see رَثْأَةٌ.<br>\
مَرْثُوْءٌ (assumed tropical:)  A man weak-hearted, and of little<br>\
intelligence or sagacity. (M.) [See also مَرْثُوٌّ,<br>\
in art. رثو.]<br>\
