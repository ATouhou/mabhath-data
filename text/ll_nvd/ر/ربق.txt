رَبَقَهُ, aor.<br>\
رَبُقَ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
رَبَقَ, (S, K,)<br>\
inf. n. رَبْقٌ, (JK, S, Msb,) He put his head (i. e.<br>\
the head of a kid, S, K, or of a lamb, K, or of a<br>\
sheep or goat, Msb) into the رِبْقْة, (S, K,) or into<br>\
the رِبْق: (Msb:) or, accord. to the M, he made<br>\
fast, or bound or tied fast or firmly, him, or it,<br>\
in the رِبْقَة: (TA:) or he made fast, or bound or<br>\
tied fast or firmly, his (a sheep&#39;s or goat&#39;s) neck<br>\
with the رِبْق, or cord: (JK:) and ↓ ربّقهُ, inf. n.<br>\
تَرْبِيقٌ, he made fast, or bound or tied fast or<br>\
firmly, him, or it, in the رِبَاق [pl. of رِبْقٌ or of<br>\
رِبْقَةٌ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] رَبَقَهُ فِى الأَمْرِ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) aor.<br>\
رَبُقَ, inf. n. رَبْقٌ, (Msb,) (assumed tropical:)  He made him<br>\
to fall into the thing, or affair. (Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
رَبْقٌ also signifies The act of making fast; or<br>\
binding, or tying, fast, or firmly; and so رِبْقٌ;<br>\
(K;) each as an inf. n. of رَبَقَهُ. (TK.)<br>\
2<br>\
ربّق [He prepared the أَرْبَاق, pl. of رِبْقٌ].<br>\
One says, رَمَّدِتِ الضَّأْنُ فَرَبّقْ رَبّقْ, i.e. [The ewes<br>\
have secreted milk in their udders: therefore]<br>\
prepare thou the أَرْبَاق: prepare thou the ارباق:<br>\
for they will bring forth soon: (S, K:) because<br>\
they [begin to] secrete milk in their udders عَلَى<br>\
رَأْسِ الوَلَدِ [i. e. at the time of bringing forth, or<br>\
when about to produce the young]. (S.) It is<br>\
not thus in the case of she-goats: therefore, (S,)<br>\
in the case of these, one says رَنّقْ, with ن,<br>\
(S, K,) meaning “ wait thou: ” because they show<br>\
sings of pregnancy in the state of their udders,<br>\
and bring forth after some length of time: and<br>\
[in the case of these] one says also رَمِّقْ, with م.<br>\
(K. [See arts. رمق and رنق.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  One also says,<br>\
رَبَّقَ أَثْنَآءَ الحَبْلِ, meaning He made loops in the<br>\
middle of the rope to put upon the necks of the<br>\
young lambs or kids. (T in art. ثنى.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See<br>\
also 1. ―<br>\
-b4-  رَبَّقْتُ الكَلَامَ I interlarded, or embel-lished, the speech, or discourse, with falsehood;<br>\
as also رَمَّقْتُهُ; syn. لَفَّقْتُ بَيْنَهُ; (JK;) [or لَفَّقْتُهُ;<br>\
for] تَرْبِيقُ الكَلَامِ signifies تَلْفِيقُهُ; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád,<br>\
K;) as also تَرْمِيقُهُ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَرَبَّقْتُ الشَّىْءَ, (JK,) or تربّقتهُ مِنْ عُنُقِى,<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K,) (tropical:)  I hung the thing upon my<br>\
neck. (JK, Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
ارتبق He (a kid) had his head put into the<br>\
رِبْقَة. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ارتبق فِى حِبَالَتِى He (a<br>\
gazelle, S, K) became caught in my snare. (Lh,<br>\
JK, S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And ارتبقتُ فِى حِبَالَتِهِ (tropical:)  I became<br>\
caught in [the snare of] his deceit. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And ارتبق فِى الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  He fell into the thing, or<br>\
affair. (Msb, K.)<br>\
-A2-  اِرْتَبَقْتُهُ لِنَفْسِى I tied, bound,<br>\
or made fast, him, or it, for myself. (TA.)<br>\
رِبْقٌ A cord having in it a number of loops<br>\
wherewith lambs, or kids, are tied, or made fast;<br>\
any one of which loops is termed ↓ رِبْقَةٌ (S, Msb,<br>\
K) and ↓ رَبْقَةٌ: (K:) or a cord which is doubled<br>\
in the form of a ring, into which is put the head<br>\
of a sheep or goat, and which is then tied, or<br>\
made fast: so, says Az, I have heard from the<br>\
Arabs of the desert of Benoo-Temeem: (TA:)<br>\
pl. [of mult.] رِبَاقٌ (S, Msb, K) and رِبَقٌ and [of<br>\
pauc.] أَرْبَاقٌ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) خَلَعَ<br>\
الإِسْلَامِ مِنْ عُنُقِهِ ↓ رِبْقَةَ, (S, Msb, TA,) occurring<br>\
in a trad., (S,) (tropical:)  He cast off the tie of El-Islám,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) with which he had bound himself,<br>\
(TA,) [from his neck.] (Msb, TA. [See also<br>\
خَلَعَ.]) And لَكُمُ العَهْدُ مَا لَمْ تَأْكُلُوا الرِّبَاقَ, also<br>\
occurring in a trad., (S,) meaning (tropical:)  [The covenant is yours] as long as ye sever not the tie with<br>\
which ye are bound; this tie being likened to the<br>\
رِبْق upon the necks of lambs or kids; and the<br>\
severing thereof, to the beast&#39;s eating its رِبْق, and<br>\
severing it; for thereby the beast becomes free<br>\
from the tie. (TA.) And in a trad. of &#39;Omar,<br>\
حُجُّوا بِالذُّرِّيَّةِ لَا تَأْكُلُوا أَرْزَاقَهَا وَتَذَرُوا أَرْبَاقَهَا فِى<br>\
أَعْنَاقِهَا [Perform ye the pilgrimage with the<br>\
women: devour not their means of subsistence,<br>\
while ye leave their ties upon their necks]: he<br>\
likens the obligations imposed upon them to ارباق.<br>\
(TA.) One says also, ↓ حَلَّ رِبْقَتَهُ, meaning (tropical:)  He<br>\
removed from him his anxiety: (K, TA:) and so<br>\
↓ قَطَعَ رِبْقَتَهُ. (TA.)<br>\
رَبْقَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
رِبْقَةٌ: see رِبْقٌ, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A thing<br>\
woven of black wool, of the width of the تِكَّة [or<br>\
band of the drawers or trowsers], in which is a<br>\
red stripe of dyed wool: its extremities are tied<br>\
together, and then it is hung upon the neck [or<br>\
shoulder] of a boy, so that one of his arms comes<br>\
forth from it like as when a man puts forth one<br>\
of his arms from the suspensory of the sword:<br>\
the Arabs of the desert hang the رِبَق [pl. of رِبْقَةٌ]<br>\
upon the necks of their boys only as a preservative from the [evil] eye. (T, TA.)<br>\
رِبِقَّانٌ and رِبِقَّانَةٌ Evil in disposition: applied to<br>\
a man; and in like manner to a woman: mentioned by As and in the K in art. عبق [where,<br>\
in some copies, it is written رَبْقَانُ]. (TA.)<br>\
رَبِيقٌ, (TA,) or رَبِيقَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) applied to a<br>\
lamb or kid (بَهْمَة), (ISk, S, K,) or to a sheep or<br>\
goat (شَاة), (Msb, TA,) Having its head put into<br>\
the رِبْقَة; (ISk, S, Msb, K, TA;) as also ↓ مَرْبُوقَةٌ<br>\
(ISk, JK, S, Msb, K) and ↓ مُرَبَّقَةٌ. (JK, TA.)<br>\
أُمُّ الرُّبَيْقِ Calamity, or misfortune: (JK, S,<br>\
K:) whence the prov., جَآءَنَا بِأمِّ الرُّبَيْقِ عَلَى أُرَيْقِ,<br>\
(TA,) meaning He brought us a great calamity,<br>\
or misfortune: (K in art. ارق:) As says that the<br>\
Arabs assert it to have been said by a man who<br>\
saw the ghool upon a dusky white camel (جَمَل<br>\
أَوْرَق); (S in that art., and TA;) أُرَيْق being the<br>\
dim. of أَوْرَق: (K in that art.:) or امّ الربيق is a<br>\
name of war, or battle: or the viper: (JK,<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA:) this last signification is held<br>\
to be correct by Z, because, he says, the viper is<br>\
short, and when it folds itself it resembles the<br>\
رِبَق (TA.)<br>\
تِرْبِيقٌ A cord with which a ewe, or goat, is tied<br>\
(K, TA) by the neck. (TA.)<br>\
مُرْبِقٌ i. q. مُطْرِقٌ [Silent: or lowering the eyes,<br>\
looking towards the ground: &amp;c.]. (JK, TA.)<br>\
مُرَبَّقَةٌ: see رَبِيقٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also, [or خُبْزَةٌ مُرَبَّقَةٌ,] A<br>\
cake of bread, or one baked in ashes, into which<br>\
fat has been put; syn. خُبْزَةٌ مُشَحَّمَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
