delayed, (ISk, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) an affair, (ISk,<br>\
S, Mgh, K,) and a person; (TA;) as also ارجى:<br>\
(ISk, S, Mgh, Msb, K:) but the former is the<br>\
better: the inf. n. is إِرْجَآءٌ. (TA.) It is said in<br>\
the Kur [xxxiii. 51], accord. to different readings,<br>\
تُرْجِىءُ مَنْ تَشَآءُ مِنْهُنَّ or تُرْجِى, meaning Thou<br>\
mayest put off whom thou wilt of them: addressed<br>\
peculiarly to the Prophet, exclusively of others of<br>\
his people. (Zj, TA.) [See also an ex. in the<br>\
Kur vii. 108 and xxvi. 35; and the various<br>\
readings mentioned by Bd in the former instance.]<br>\
-A2-  أَرْجَأَتْ She (a camel, S, K, and in like manner a pregnant female [of any kind], TA) was, or<br>\
became, near to bringing forth; as also أَرْجَتْ:<br>\

He (a hunter or sportsman) was unsuccessful,<br>\
getting no game; as also ارجى: (K, TA:) or you<br>\

مُرْجَأٌ [pass. part. n. of 4]. It is said in the Kur<br>\
[ix. 107], (S, K,) as some read, (S,) وَآخَرُونَ,<br>\
مُرْجَؤُونَ لِأَمْرِ اللّٰهِ, (S, K,) or, as others read,<br>\

[act. part. n. of أَرْجَى], (S, [in which, however, it<br>\
is not clearly shown whether the author means<br>\
that this corresponds to مُرْجِىءٌ or that it is a rel.<br>\
n. corresponding to مُرْجِئِىٌّ, the former being certainly the case,]) or not thus, but مُرْجِىٌّ, (K,) so<br>\

assert that faith (الإِيمَان) consists in words without works; as though they postponed works to<br>\
words; asserting that if they do not pray nor<br>\
fast, their faith will save them: (TA:) a sect<br>\
who assert that disobedience, with faith, does not<br>\
injure; and that obedience, with disbelief, does<br>\
not profit: (KT:) or a sect who do not pronounce<br>\
judgment upon any one for aught in the present<br>\
life, but defer judgment to the day of resurrection: (Msb:) those who decide not, against the<br>\
committers of great sins, aught as to pardon or<br>\
punishment; deferring the judgment respecting<br>\
such sins to the day of resurrection. (Mgh in<br>\
art. جهم.) ―<br>\
