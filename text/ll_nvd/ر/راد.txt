-A3-<br>\
Also رَأْدٌ A vacant tract (خَلَآء) of land. (K.)<br>\
رُؤْدٌ (T, L, TA; in a copy of the M ↓ رُؤُودٌ<br>\
[perhaps a mistranscription for رَؤُودٌ if not for<br>\
رُؤْدٌ; but more probably for the former, which see<br>\
in art. رود]; in the L, in one place, ↓ رَؤُدٌ; and in<br>\

as is also رُؤْدٌ];) A branch, or twig, in the most<br>\

A, L,) in the first year of its growth: (T, A, L:)<br>\
[being also used as a coll. gen. n.,] it has for its<br>\

the extremity of any branch or twig: the pl. is<br>\
أَرْآدٌ and أَرَائِدُ; the latter of which is extr.; and is<br>\
not a pl. pl.; for, were it so, it would be أَرَائِيدُ<br>\

↓ رَائِدَةٌ (A) and in some copies of the K رُودَةٌ<br>\
without ء, [which is in some copies written with ء,<br>\
and] to which the signification there next given<br>\
(أَصْلُ اللَّحْىِ) is in other copies made to belong,<br>\
(TA,) and some add رَادٌ, without ء, (MF,) (tropical:)  A<br>\
youthful girl: (T:) or a soft, or tender, girl or<br>\
woman: (A:) and (T) a woman goodly, or<br>\
beautiful, (T, S, K,) and youthful: (T, K:) or<br>\

food: (M:) pl. of the first أَرْآدٌ. (T, M.) You<br>\
say غَيْرُ رَادَةِ ↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ رَأْدَةٌ, in which the former رادة<br>\
may be without ء, and the latter must be so,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  A soft, or tender, woman; not one<br>\
that roves about. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also رُؤْدٌ i. q. تُؤَدَةٌ<br>\
[Moderation; gentleness; a leisurely manner of<br>\
proceeding; &amp;c.] (M, K. [In the latter, the form<br>\
of the word having this signification is not plainly<br>\
indicated.]) A poet says,<br>\
كَأَنَّهُ ثَمِلٌ يَمْشِى عَلَىرُودِ<br>\
[As though he were one intoxicated, walking in a<br>\
gentle, or leisurely, manner]; for علىرُؤدِ; suppressing the ء for the sake of the rhyme: but he<br>\
who regards the word as that of which رُوَيْدٌ is the<br>\
dim. does not regard it as originally with ء. (M,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also رَأْدٌ.<br>\
رَؤُدٌ: see the first sentence in the next preceding<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
رِئْدٌ A sucker, an offset, or a shoot from the<br>\
root, of a tree: (M, K:) or a soft, or tender,<br>\
branch, or twig, thereof: pl. رِئْدَانٌ. (M.) ―<br>\

man, but mostly used in relation to females: (M:)<br>\
sometimes, [in poetry,] رِيدٌ, with the ء suppressed,<br>\
(T, S, M,) for the sake of the rhyme; (M;) as in<br>\
in a verse of Kutheiyir cited voce أُصْدَةٌ: (T, S:)<br>\
pl. أَرْآدٌ. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Straitness: (K, TA: [in<br>\
the CK, الضّيِّقُ is erroneously put for الضِّيقُ:])<br>\
you say, وَقَعَ فِىالرِّئْدِ He fell into straitness.<br>\
(TK.) But [SM says,] I have not found this in<br>\
any of the lexicons that I have. (TA.)<br>\
