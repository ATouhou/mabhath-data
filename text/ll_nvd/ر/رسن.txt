رَسَنَ الفَرَسَ (S,) or الدَّابَّةَ, (M, Msb, *)<br>\
and النَّاقَهَ, (M, K, *) aor.<br>\
رَسُنَ and<br>\
رَسِنَ, (M, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. رَسْنٌ; (M, Msb;) and ↓ ارسن; (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K;) He tied the horse [or the beast and the<br>\
she-camel] with the رَسَن [q: v.]: (S:) or he bound<br>\
upon the [horse or] beast [or she-camel] its رَسَن:<br>\
(Msb:) or he made for, or put to, the [horse<br>\
or] beast or she-camel a رَسَن: (M, * K: [in the<br>\
former it is merely indicated that the two verbs<br>\
signify the same:]) or the former verb [in the<br>\
CK the latter verb] has the first signification;<br>\
(M, K, TA;) and the latter verb has the<br>\
last signification; (M, TA;) thus resembling<br>\
حَزَمَ and أَحْزَمَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And رَسَنَ الدَّابَّةَ, and<br>\
↓ ارسنها, He left the beast to itself, to pasture as<br>\
it pleased. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَرْسَنَ see above, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also ارسن المُهْرُ<br>\
The colt was, or became, submissive, manageable,<br>\
or tractable, and gave its head. (TA.)<br>\
رَسَنٌ A rope, or cord: (S, M, Msb, K:) or [a<br>\
halter; i. e.] a rope, or cord, with which a camel<br>\
[or a horse (see 1)] is led: (TA:) and such of<br>\
the [reins, or leading-ropes, termed] أَزِمَّة [pl. of<br>\
زِمَامٌ] as is upon the nose; (M;) [in other words,]<br>\
such a زِمَام as is upon a nose: (K:) pl. أِرْسَانٌ<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K) and أَرْسُنٌ, (M, Msb, K,) [both<br>\
properly pls. of pauc.,] and sometimes they said<br>\
رُسُنٌ; (Msb;) or, accord. to Sb, it has no other<br>\
pl. than أَرْسَانٌ; (M, Msb;) [but perhaps he<br>\
meant of pauc., for SM says,] Sb disallowed<br>\
أَرْسُنٌ. (TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely, Ibn-Mukbil, (TA,)<br>\
هَرِيتٌ قَصِيرُ عِذَارِ الِلّجَامِ<br>\
أَسِيلٌ طَوِيلُ عِذَارِ الرَّسّنْ<br>\
[Wide-mouthed, short in the cheek-straps of the<br>\
bridle (or headstall): smooth and long in the<br>\
cheek, long in the appertenance of the halter corresponding to the cheek-straps of the bridle or<br>\
headstall; because this appertenance is longer<br>\
than are the cheek-straps of the bridle or headstall]. (S, TA.) مّرَّ الصَّعَالِيكِ بِأَرْسَانِ الخَيْلِ [As<br>\
the passing along of the robbers with the halters<br>\
of the horses] is a prov., applied to an affair, or<br>\
event, that is quick and uninterrupted. (TA.)<br>\
And one says, رَمَى بِرَسَنِهِ عَلَى غَارِبِهِ [He threw<br>\
his leading-rope upon his withers], meaning (assumed tropical:)  he<br>\
left his way free, or open, to him; so that God<br>\
did not withhold him from that which he desired<br>\
to do. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] رَسَنُ البَازِى [The leash<br>\
of the hawk]. (A in art. رود.)<br>\
-A2-  [The pl.]<br>\
أَرْسَانٌ also signifies Rugged and hard tracts of<br>\
ground. (K, * TA.)<br>\
رَاسَنٌ A certain plant, resembling the plant<br>\
called زَنْجَبِيل [i. e. ginger]; (M;) i. q. قَنَسٌ;<br>\
[both of which names are applied to the inula<br>\
helenium, common inula, or elecampane; also<br>\
called in the present day زَنْجَبِيلٌ شَامِىٌّ;] a Pers.<br>\
word [arabicized]. (K.)<br>\
مَرْسِنٌ (S, M, K) and مَرْسَنٌ, (M, K,) or the<br>\
latter should be مِرْسَنٌ, [but I think this doubtful,] thus written in some of the copies of the<br>\
S, and in both ways in the L, (TA,) The part,<br>\
of the nose of the horse, which is the place of the<br>\
رَسَن: (S:) or the nose of a solid-hoofed animal:<br>\
this is the primary signification: (M:) then, by a<br>\
secondary application, (S, M,) the nose (S, M, K)<br>\
in an absolute sense, (M, K,) or, of a human<br>\
being: (S:) pl. مَرَاسِنُ (TA) [which, as stated<br>\
by Freytag, is used in a sing. sense, in the<br>\
Deewán of Jereer, as meaning the nose]. سَلِسُ<br>\
المَرْسِنِ, a phrase used by the poet El-Jaadee,<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  Easy to be led, tractable, or compliant.<br>\
(TA.) And you say, فَعَلْتُ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى رَغْمِ مَرْسِنِهِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [I did that against his wish; in spite of him;<br>\
or notwithstanding his dislike, or disapproval, or<br>\
hatred; like as you say, عَلَى رَغْمِ أَنْفِهِ]. (S.)<br>\
مَرْسُونٌ A horse [or the like] tied with the<br>\
رسن: (S:) [or having a رَسَن bound upon him or<br>\
attached to him, or made for him: see 1.] You<br>\
say, أَجْرَرْتُ المَرْسُونَ رَسَنَهُ I made the haltered<br>\
beast to drag his halter. (TA.)<br>\
المَرْسِينُ [The myrtle-tree;] i. q. رَيْحَانُ القُبُورِ:<br>\
of the dial. of Egypt. (TA.) [Also mentioned in<br>\
art. مرس: for some hold the م to be augmentative; and some, the ن.]<br>\
