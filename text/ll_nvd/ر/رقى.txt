رَقِىَ, aor. يَرْقَى, inf. n. رُقِىٌّ (JK, K, TA,<br>\
[but this inf. n. is omitted in the CK,]) and رَقْىٌ,<br>\
(K, TA, [but this is omitted in my MS. copy of<br>\
the K,]) He ascended, إِلَيْهِ [to him, or it]; as<br>\
also ↓ ارتقى, and ↓ ترقّى: (K:) or he ascended a<br>\
ladder, or a stair: (JK:) or رَقِيتُ فِيهِ, (S, Msb,<br>\
in the Mgh رَقِىَ فيه,) inf. n. رُقِىٌّ (S, Mgh, Msb)<br>\
and رَقْىٌ; (S, Msb;) and ↓ ارتقيت, (S, Mgh, *<br>\
Msb,) and ↓ ترقّيت; (Mgh, * Msb;) I ascended<br>\
it; (S;) namely, a ladder, or a stair, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) &amp;c.: (Msb:) and رَقِيتُ الجَبَلَ (Msb,)<br>\
and السَّطْحَ, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) the verb being<br>\
thus trans. by itself, (Msb, TA,) without فِى<br>\
(Mgh,) and likewise with فى, (TA,) I ascended,<br>\
or mounted, upon the mountain, and upon the<br>\
house-top: (Msb:) and ↓ ارتقى is in like manner<br>\
trans. without فى; whence the saying, لَقَدِ<br>\
صَعْبًا ↓ ارْتَقَيْتَ مُرْتَقًى [Thou hast indeed ascended<br>\
a difficult place of ascent]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
اِرْقَ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ Ascend thou, and go, [according<br>\
to thy limping, or halting, i. e.] as far as thou<br>\
art able to do so, and impose not upon thyself<br>\
that which thou art not able to perform. (S,<br>\
TA. [Some, instead of اِرْقَ, say اِرْقَأْ; and some,<br>\
اِرْقِ, from the verb mentioned in the next sentence;<br>\
and some, ق: see 1 in art. رقأ; and see also art.<br>\
ظلع.])<br>\
-A2-  رَقَاهُ, (JK, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَرْقِى,<br>\
(JK, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. رُقْيَةٌ (JK, S, Mgh, K)<br>\
and رَقْى (JK, Mgh, Msb, * K) and رُقِىٌّ (K,)<br>\
He charmed him, syn. عَوَّذَهُ, (JK, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
by [invoking] God: (Msb:) and (Mgh) he<br>\
puffed, or sputtered, upon his charm; syn. نَفَثَ<br>\
فِى عُوذَتِهِ: (Mgh, K:) [it signifies he charmed<br>\
him from, or against, such a thing; (مِنْ كَذَا;)<br>\
and also he enchanted him, or fascinated him;<br>\
by uttering a spell; or by tying knots in a thread,<br>\
or string, and puffing, or sputtering, upon them;<br>\
or by both these actions combined: see the last<br>\
chap. but one of the Kur-án:] the epithet applied<br>\
to the performer is ↓ رَاقٍ [meaning Charming;<br>\
&amp;c.]; (S, Mgh, TA;) and ↓ رَقَّآءٌ [A charmer;<br>\
&amp;c.; or one who habitually practises charming;<br>\
&amp;c.]: (JK, K, TA:) and the epithet applied to<br>\
the person who is the object of the performance<br>\
is ↓ مَرْقِىٌّ [meaning Charmed; &amp;c.]. (JK, TA.)<br>\
In the saying اِرْقِ عَلَى رَأْسِى مِنَ الصُّدَاعِ, meaning<br>\
Charm thou me (عَوِّذْنِى [or rather charm thou<br>\
my head against the headache]), the verb is made<br>\
trans. by means of على because it is as though it<br>\
implied the meaning of اِقْرّأْ [i. e. “ recite thou ”<br>\
a spell] and اُنْفُثْ [i. e. “ puff,” or “ sputter,”<br>\
upon knots]. (Mgh.)<br>\
2<br>\
رِقّاهُ, inf. n. تَرْقِيَةٌ, He made him to ascend;<br>\
syn. صَعَّدَهُ. (TA.) [See an ex. in a verse of ElAashà cited in art. ثمن, voce ثَمَانُونَ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [And<br>\
hence, He elevated, or exalted, him.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence<br>\
also,] رَقَّى عَلَيْهِ كَلَامًا, inf. n. as above, i. q. رَفَعَ<br>\
[meaning He told, or related, a saying against<br>\
him; he informed against him; as is indicated by<br>\
what next follows, and by a meaning of ترقّى as<br>\
quasi-pass. of رقّى thus used]. (S, K.) You say<br>\
also, رقّى عَلَى البَاطِلَ, inf. n. as above, He<br>\
brought a false accusation against me; said,<br>\
against me, what was not the case; and exaggerated [in what he said against me]. (JM,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَرَقَّىَ see 1, first sentence, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] ترقّى فِىِ العِلْمِ He rose by degrees, or<br>\
step by step, in knowledge, or science. (S, TA.)<br>\
And hence, مَا زَالَ يَتَرَقَّى بِهِ الحَالُ حَتَّى بَلَغَ غَايَتَهُ<br>\
The state, or condition, ceased not to rise with<br>\
him until he reached the utmost point thereof.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also, the verb being quasi-pass.<br>\
of 2,] ترقّى إِلَيْهِ الخَبَرٌ The news, or information,<br>\
came to him, or reached him. (MA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تراقى [meaning He exalted himself] is<br>\
from الرُّقِىُّ signifying الصُّعُودُ and الاِرْتِفَاعُ. (Har<br>\
p. 128.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِرْتَقَىَ see 1, first sentence, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] ارتقى بَطْنُهُ His belly became [drawn<br>\
up, i. e.] lean, or lank; syn. اِنْطَوَى: said of a<br>\
camel, and of a sheep or goat. (JK.)<br>\
10<br>\
استرقاهُ He asked him, or desired him, to<br>\
charm him. (S, * TA.)<br>\
رُقْيَةٌ i. q. عُوذَةٌ [as meaning A charm, or spell,<br>\
either uttered or written], (K, TA,) by which a<br>\
person having an evil affection, such as fever and<br>\
epilepsy &amp;c., is charmed: (TA:) when it is in<br>\
any other language than that of the Arabs, and<br>\
one knows not what is in it, it is disapproved,<br>\
lest it should involve enchantment (سِحْر) and<br>\
infidelity; but in such as is from the Kur-án or<br>\
any of the forms of prayer, there is no harm:<br>\
(Mgh in art. تم: [see تَمِيمَةٌ:]) [but عُوذَةٌ generally<br>\
signifies “ an amulet to charm the wearer against<br>\
the evil eye &amp;c. ”:] &#39;Orweh says,<br>\
فَمَا تَرَكَا مِنْ عُوذَةٍ يَعْرِفَانِهَا<br>\
وَلَا رُقْيَةٍ إِلَّا بِهَا رَقَيَانِى<br>\
[And they two left not any amulet that they<br>\
knew, nor any charm, or spell, but with it they<br>\
charmed me]: (TA:) [sometimes, also, it signifies<br>\
anything by which one enchants, or fascinates:<br>\
and hence it is said,] المَرْأَةُ رُقْيَةٌ [Woman is a<br>\
thing by which one is enchanted, or fascinated]:<br>\
(Msb:) pl. رُقًى. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
رُقْيَا [The act, or practice, or art, of charming:<br>\
and also, of enchanting, or fascinating; i. e.<br>\
enchantment, or fascination:] the subst., (Msb,)<br>\
of the measure فُعْلَى, from رَقَاهُ, aor. يَرْقِيهِ. (Msb,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
رُقِيَّةٌ [Ascent; or the act of ascending;] the<br>\
subst. from رَقِىَ aor. يَرْقَى. (TA.)<br>\
رَقَّآءٌ One who ascends mountains much or often.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, last sentence but one.<br>\
رَاقٍ: see 1, last sentence but one. The saying<br>\
in the Kur [lxxv. 27], مَنْ رَاقٍ [Who is one that<br>\
charms?] means that there is no charmer that<br>\
shall charm him and protect him: or, accord. to<br>\
I&#39;Ab, the meaning is, who is he that ascendeth<br>\
with his soul? shall the angels of mercy [ascend<br>\
with it] or the angels of punishment? (TA.) In<br>\
the saying of a rájiz,<br>\
لَقَدْ عَلِمْتَ وَالأَجَلِّ البَاقِى<br>\
أَنْ لَنْ يَرُدَّ القَدَرَ الرَّوَاقِى<br>\
[the meaning may be, Assuredly thou knowest,<br>\
by the Most Majestic, the Everlasting, that<br>\
the female charmers will not repel, or avert,<br>\
that which is decreed; or, that the potent charmers will not &amp;c.: for] the pl. may be that of<br>\
↓ رَاقِيَةٌ as an epithet applied to a woman, or of this<br>\
same word as an intensive epithet applied to a<br>\
man. (S.)<br>\

what next precedes.<br>\
مَرْقًى A place of ascent; as also ↓ مُرْتَقًى;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) and so ↓ مَرْقَاةٌ and ↓ مِرْقَاةٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
or ↓ these last two signify a series of steps or<br>\
stairs; or a ladder; syn. دَرَجَةٌ; (S, K;) and سُلَّمٌ;<br>\
(M and K in art. سلم;) the former of them as<br>\
being a place of ascent, and the latter of them<br>\
as being likened to an instrument; (S, Msb;)<br>\
and both of them are authorized by the M;<br>\
(TA;) but the latter of them is disallowed by<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd, and said by him to be not of the<br>\
language of the Arabs: (Msb, TA:) the pl. of<br>\
↓ مِرَقَاةٌ [and of مَرْقًى] is مَرَاقٍ. (TA.) You say<br>\
جَبَلٌ لَا مَرْقَى فِيهِ and ↓ لا مُرْتَقَى (JK, TA) A<br>\
mountain in which is no place of ascent. (TA.)<br>\
مَرْقِيَا الأَنْفِ [in my MS. copy of the K مُرْقِيَا]<br>\

so says Th; but the expression commonly known<br>\
