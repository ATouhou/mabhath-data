رَضِىَ is originally رَضِوَ; the و being changed<br>\
into ى because of the kesreh: (S:) the tribe of<br>\
Teiyi said رَضَا for رَضِىَ. (IDrd in his lex., cited<br>\
by Freytag; and Mughnee voce إِلَى there said to<br>\
be a dial. var. of رَضِىَ.) You say, رَضِىَ عَنْهُ, (S,<br>\
M, Msb, K,) and عَلَيْهِ, (M, Msb, K,) which is of<br>\
the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, (Msb,) the<br>\
verb being thus made trans. by means of على,<br>\
accord. to Ks, agreeably with the opinion of Sb<br>\
respecting instances of this kind, for the purpose<br>\
of making it to accord with its contr., سَخِطَ,<br>\
(M, TA,) aor. يَرْضَى, (K,) inf. n. رِضًى (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K) and رُضًى (M, K) and رِضْوَانٌ and رُضْوَانٌ,<br>\
(S, * M, Msb, * K,) the last of the dial. of Keys<br>\
and Temeem, (Msb, TA,) and mentioned by Sb,<br>\
(M, TA,) but all the readers of the Kur read<br>\
رضوان with kesr, except &#39;Ásim, who is related<br>\
to have read it with damm, (T, TA,) and مَرْضَاةٌ,<br>\
(S, * M, K,) originally مَرْضَوَةٌ, (TA,) He was<br>\
pleased, well pleased, content, contented, or satisfied, with him; regarded him with good will, or<br>\
favour; or liked, or approved, him; (MA;)<br>\
[i. e., as said above,] contr. of سَخِطَ; (M, Msb,<br>\
K;) the object being a person: (Msb:) and Sb<br>\
states that they also said رَضْيُوا, with the medial<br>\
radical quiescent, for رَضُوا; but it is extr. (M,<br>\
TA.) The saying in the Kur [v. last verse but<br>\
one, and ix. 101, &amp;c.] رَضِىَ اللّٰهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ<br>\
[God is well pleased with them and they are well<br>\
pleased with Him] means God is well pleased<br>\
with their deeds and they are well pleased with<br>\
the recompense that He has bestowed upon them:<br>\
(M, TA:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib, رِضَى العَبْدِ<br>\
عَنِ اللّٰهِ means The servant&#39;s, or man&#39;s, being not<br>\
displeased with that which God&#39;s decree has made<br>\
to happen to him; and رِضَى اللّٰهِ عِنِ العَبْدِ, God&#39;s<br>\
seeing the servant, or man, to be obedient to that<br>\
which He has commanded, and refraining from<br>\
that which He has forbidden. (TA.) You say<br>\
also, رَضِيتُهُ, (S, Msb, K,) and رَضِيتُ بِهِ, (M,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. رِضًى (Msb, TA) [and رُضًى and<br>\
رِضْوَانٌ &amp;c., as above]; and ↓ اِرْتَضَيْتُهُ; (S, Msb;)<br>\
I was pleased, well pleased, content, contented, or<br>\
satisfied, with it; regarded it with good will, or<br>\
favour; or liked, or approved, it: (MA: [for the<br>\
verb is there said to have the same signification<br>\
in the phrases رَضِيَهُ and رَضِىَ بِهِ as it has in رَضِىَ<br>\
عَنْهُ and عَلَيْهِ; and ارتضاه is there similarly explained: and the like is implied in the S and K;<br>\
and is evidently agreeable with general usage:])<br>\
or he chose it, or preferred it: (Msb, TA:)<br>\
the object being a thing: (S, Msb, TA:) or<br>\
(accord. to explanations of تَرْضَاهَا in the Kur<br>\
ii. 139) I loved it, or liked it; (Ksh, Bd, Jel;)<br>\
inclined to it; (Ksh;) had a desire for it. (Bd.)<br>\
The saying of the lawyers, [respecting a woman<br>\
whose consent to her marriage has been asked,]<br>\
يَشْهَدُ عَلَى رِضَاهَا means It [i. e. her silence]<br>\
testifies, or declares, her permission [or consent];<br>\
because permission indicates رِضًى. (Msb.) You<br>\
say also, رَضِيتُ بِهِ صَاحِبًا [I was pleased with him,<br>\
or I liked him, or approved him, or chose him,<br>\
or preferred him, as a companion]. (S.) And<br>\
رَضِيَهُ لِذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ, and ↓ ارتضاهُ, [which may be well<br>\
rendered He approved him for that thing, or<br>\
affair,] meaning he saw him, or judged him, to<br>\
be fit for that thing, or affair. (M.) And<br>\
لِصُحْبَتِهِ وَخِدْمَتِهِ ↓ ارتضاهُ (K, TA) He [approved<br>\
him, or] chose him, or preferred him; and saw<br>\
him, or judged him, to be fit; for his companionship, and his service. (TA.) And رُضِيَتْ مَعيشَتُهُ<br>\
[His living, or sustenance, was found pleasing,<br>\
well pleasing, contenting, or satisfying; or was<br>\
liked, or approved]: one should not say رَضِيَتة [in<br>\
this case]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَضَوْتُهُ, (S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
أَرْضُوهُ, (S, K,) signifies I surpassed him in رِضًى<br>\
[i. e. in being pleased, well pleased, content, &amp;c.:<br>\
see above, second sentence]: (S, * M, K *:) so in<br>\
the saying, فَرَضَوْتُهُ ↓ رَاضَانِى [He vied, or contended, with me in being pleased, well pleased,<br>\
content, &amp;c., and I surpassed him therein]: (S,<br>\
M, K:) the inf. n. of راضانى thus used is مُرَاضَاةٌ<br>\
and رِضَآءٌ; (M;) both these signify the same (K,<br>\
TA) as inf. ns. of this verb. (TA.)<br>\

رَضَّوَ see 4.<br>\
3<br>\
رَاْضَوَ see 1, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  راضَيْتُهُ, inf. n. مُرَاضَاةٌ<br>\
and رِضَآءٌ, signifies [also] I agreed, consented,<br>\
accorded, or was of one mind or opinion, with<br>\
him. (Msb.)<br>\
4<br>\
ارضاهُ, (M, MA, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِرْضَآءٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
He, or it, made him to be pleased, well pleased,<br>\
content, contented, or satisfied; (MA;) [he, or it,<br>\
pleased, contented, or satisfied, him:] or he gave<br>\
him that with which he would be pleased, well<br>\
pleased, content, contented, or satisfied. (M, K: *<br>\
in the former, أَعْطَاهُ مَا يَرْضَى بِهِ: in the latter,<br>\
أَعْطَاهُ مَا يُرْضِيهِ.) Hence, in the Kur [ix. 8],<br>\
يُرْضُونَكُمْ بِأَفْوَاهِهِمْ وَتَأْبَى قُلُوبُهُمْ [They will please<br>\
you, or content you, with their mouths, but<br>\
their hearts will be incompliant]. (TA.) And<br>\
أَرْضَيْتُهُ عَنِّى, and ↓ رَضَّيْتُهُ with teshdeed, [I made<br>\
him to be pleased, well pleased, content, &amp;c., with<br>\
me,] فَرَضِىَ [and he was pleased, &amp;c.]. (S.)<br>\
5<br>\
ترضّاهُ He sought to please, content, or<br>\
satisfy, him; (M, K;) as also ↓ استرضاهُ. (K.)<br>\
A poet says,<br>\
إِذَا العَجُوزُ غَضِبَتْ فَطَلِّقْ<br>\
وَلَا تَرَضَّاهَا وَلَا تَمَلَّقْ<br>\
[When the old woman is angry, then divorce thou;<br>\
and seek not to please, or content, her, nor behave<br>\
in a loving, or blandishing, or coaxing, manner]:<br>\
he says تَرَضَّاهَا instead of تَرَضَّهَا to avoid what is<br>\
termed خَبْنٌ; but some relate it in the manner<br>\
better known, saying وَلَا تَرَضَّهَا. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also]<br>\
تَرَضَّيْتُهُ I pleased, contented, or satisfied, him<br>\
(أَرْضَيْتُهُ) after striving, labouring, or toiling. (S.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَرَاضَيَاهُ [They two agreed, consented, accorded, or were of one mind or opinion, respecting<br>\
it; or were pleased, well pleased, content, contented, or satisfied, with it; they both liked it, or<br>\
approved it]: (A, K:) and تَرَاضَيَا بِهِ [signifies the<br>\
same]. (Bd in iv. 28.) And تَرَاضَوْهُ بَيْنَهُمْ They<br>\
agreed among themselves in being pleased, contented, or satisfied, with it; or in liking, or<br>\
approving, it. (MA.) إِذَا تَرَاضَوْا بَيْنَهُمْ, in the<br>\
Kur [ii. 232], means [When they agree, or consent, among themselves; or] when they are pleased,<br>\
well pleased, content, &amp;c., [among themselves,]<br>\
every one of them with his [or her] companion.<br>\
(TA.) Hence the trad., إِنَّمَا البَيْعُ عَنْ تَرَاضً [Sel-ling, or buying, is only resultant from mutual<br>\
agreement, consent, or content, or approval].<br>\
(TA.) And you say, وَقَعَ بِهِ التَّرَاضِى [Mutual<br>\
agreement, or consent, to it, or mutual content<br>\
with it, or mutual approval of it, happened, or<br>\
took place]. (A, K. [In some copies of the K,<br>\
by the omission of وَ, this phrase is made to be as<br>\
though it were meant as an explanation of<br>\
تَرَاضَيَاهُ.])<br>\
8<br>\
إِرْتَضَوَ see 1, in three places.<br>\
10<br>\
استرضاهُ He asked, begged, or petitioned, of<br>\
him that he would please, content, or satisfy, him,<br>\
or that he would give him that with which he<br>\
would be pleased, well pleased, content, contented,<br>\
or satisfied. (Z, K.) You say, اِسْتَرْضَيْتُهُ فَأَرْضَانِى<br>\
[I asked, begged, or petitioned, of him that he<br>\
would please me, &amp;c., and he pleased me, &amp;c.].<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\

رُضًى A certain idol-temple, belonging to [the<br>\
tribe of] Rabee&#39;ah: (K:) whence they gave the<br>\
name of عَبْدُ رُضًى [Servant of Rudà]. (TA.)<br>\
رِضًى is merely an inf. n., (S,) [as such] syn.<br>\
with مَرْضَاةٌ, (K,) meaning The being pleased, well<br>\
pleased, content, &amp;c.; [see 1;] contr. of سَخَطٌ:<br>\
(M:) and the simple subst. is ↓ رِضَآءٌ, with medd.;<br>\
[signifying a state of being pleased, &amp;c.;] (Akh,<br>\
S;) or the latter is only an inf. n. of 3, (M,) syn.<br>\
with مُرَاضَاةٌ: (M, K:) [but] the former [is also<br>\
used as a subst., signifying content, or approval:<br>\
and permission, or consent: and] is dualized, app.<br>\
as meaning the kind [or mode or manner, of being<br>\
pleased, &amp;c.]: (M:) the dual is رِضَوَانٍ and رِضَيَانِ:<br>\
(S, M, K:) Ks heard رِضَوَانِ and حَمَوَانِ as duals<br>\
of رِضًى and حِمًى; and says that the proper way<br>\
is to say رِضَيَانِ and حِمَيَانِ, [which in the case of<br>\
the former is strange, as its final radical is و,]<br>\
but that the pronunciation with و is the more<br>\
common: (S:) and accord. to some, مَرَاضٍ is an<br>\
irreg. pl. of رِضًى; but others say that it is pl. of<br>\
مَرْضَاةٌ. (TA.) You say, مَا فَعَلْتُهُ عِنْ رِضَاهُ and<br>\
رِضْوَتِهِ: see the latter, below. (Z, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
رَاضٍ, latter sentence.<br>\
-A2-  And رَجُلٌ رِضًى, (M, K,)<br>\
and قَوْمٌ رِضًى, (M,) A man, (M, K,) and a<br>\
people, or party, (M,) with whom one is pleased,<br>\
well pleased, contented, or satisfied; regarded<br>\
with good will, or favour; liked, or approved;<br>\
syn. مَرْضِىٌّ (M, K) and قُنْعَانٌ: رِضًى being, thus<br>\
used, an inf. n. in the sense of a pass. part. n.,<br>\
like as the inf. n. is used in the sense of an act.<br>\
part. n. in the instance of عَدْلٌ, and خَصْمٌ. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [See also رَضِىٌّ; for which رِضًى or رِضًا seems<br>\
to be erroneously substituted, in two senses, in<br>\
some copies of the K.]<br>\
رَضٍ: see رَاضٍ.<br>\
مَا فَعَلْتُهُ عَنْ رِضْوَتِهِ means ↓ عَنْ رِضَاهُ [i. e. I<br>\
did it not of, or with, his pleasure, good pleasure,<br>\
content, or approval]. (Z, K.)<br>\
رِضْوَانٌ an inf. n. of رَضِىَ; like رُضْوَانٌ. (M, K,<br>\
&amp;c.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The treasurer, keeper, or guardian,<br>\
of Paradise. (MA, K.)<br>\
رِضَآءٌ: see رِضًى, first sentence.<br>\
رَضِىٌّ: see رَاضٍ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K, TA,) i. e. like<br>\
غَنِىٌّ, (TA,) [in the CK الرِّضَى, and in my MS.<br>\
copy of the K الرِّضَا, are put in the place of الرَّضِىُّ,]<br>\
One who is responsible, accountable, or answerable; syn. ضَامِنٌ: so in the copies of the K, and<br>\
in like manner in the Tekmileh: accord. to the<br>\
copies of the T, ضَامِرٌ [lean, or light of flesh, &amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Loving; a lover; or a friend.<br>\
(IAar, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And Obeying, or obedient.<br>\
(IAar, TA.)<br>\
رَاضٍ, of which the pl. is رُضَاةٌ; and ↓ رَضِىٌّ, of<br>\
which the pl. is أَرْضِيَآءُ and رُضَاةٌ, (M, K,) the<br>\
latter pl. on the authority of Lh, but extr. as pl.<br>\
of رَضِىٌّ, and in my opinion, [says ISd,] it is pl.<br>\
of رَاضٍ only; (M;) and ↓ رَضٍ, of which the pl.<br>\
is رَضُونَ; (Lh, M, K;) Pleased, well pleased,<br>\
content, contented, or satisfied; regarding with<br>\
good will, or favour; liking, or approving. (M,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ means مَرْضِيَّةٌ [i. e. A state, or<br>\
sort, of life that is found pleasing, well pleasing,<br>\
contenting, or satisfying; or with which one is<br>\
pleased, &amp;c.; or that is liked, or approved]: (S,<br>\
K:) or, accord. to Sb, رَاضِيَةٌ is, in this case, a<br>\
possessive epithet, meaning ↓ ذَاتُ رِضًى [i. e.<br>\
having approvedness; رِضًى being here an inf. n.<br>\
of رُضِيَتْ]. (M, TA.)<br>\
مَرْضَآةٌ, originally مَرْضَوَةٌ, (TA,) an inf. n. of<br>\
رَضِىَ. (S, * M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also A cause, or means,<br>\
or an occasion, of رِضًى, i. e., of being pleased,<br>\
well pleased, conten, &amp;c.: a word of the same<br>\
class as مَبْخَلَةٌ and مَجْبَنَةٌ. Hence the saying,]<br>\
البِرُّ مَرْضَاةٌ لِلرَّبِّ مَسْخَطَةٌ لِلشَّيْطَانِ [Piety is a<br>\
cause of approbation to the Lord, a cause of<br>\
disapprobation, or anger, to the devil]. (TA in<br>\
art. سخط.) The pl. of مَرْضَاةٌ is مَرَاضٍ [accord. to<br>\
rule]: or this is an irreg. pl. of رِضًى. (TA.)<br>\
مَرْضُوٌّ: see what follows.<br>\
مَرْضِىٌّ and ↓ مَرْضُوٌّ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) the<br>\
former the more common, (S, Msb,) the latter<br>\
erroneously written in [some of] the copies of the<br>\
K مَرْضُىٌّ, (TA,) applied to a thing, (S, Msb,) or<br>\
a person, (M,) Found pleasing, well pleasing,<br>\
contenting, or satisfying; or with which, or with<br>\
whom, one is pleased, &amp;c.; or liked, or approved:<br>\
(K: [the meaning being there indicated to be the<br>\
contr. of مَسْخُوطٌ; and being well known to be<br>\
commonly as above:]) or chosen, or preferred:<br>\
