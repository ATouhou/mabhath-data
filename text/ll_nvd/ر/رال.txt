استرألت الرِّئْلَانُ The young ostriches became<br>\
big, or advanced in age; syn. كَبِرَت, (O,) or<br>\
كَبُرَت, (so in one of my copies of the S, in the<br>\
other كَثُرَت [which is a mistranscription],) or<br>\
كَبُرَتْ أَسْنَانُهَا. (K: so in my MS. copy and in<br>\
the CK.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,] استرأل النَّبَاتُ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
plant, or herb, became tall; likened to the neck<br>\
of the young ostrich. (S, O, K.)<br>\
رَأْلٌ The young one of the ostrich: (T, S, M, K:)<br>\
or a young ostrich in its first year, or a year old:<br>\
(M, K:) it occurs in a verse of Imra-el-Keys<br>\
written رال, without ء: (M:) fem. with ة: (S, M,<br>\
K:) pl. (of pauc., TA) أَرْوُلٌ (K, TA, [in the<br>\
TT, as from the M, written ارْأَل, probably for<br>\
أَرْأُلٌ,]) and (of mult., TA) رِئْلَانٌ and رِئَالٌ (S, M,<br>\
K) and رِئَالَةٌ. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] الرِّئَالُ [which<br>\
seems to be the most common of the plso] (assumed tropical:)  Certain stars: (S, Sgh, K:) [probably certain small<br>\
stars in the neighbourhood of those called النَّعَائِمُ,<br>\
or of those called النَّعَامَاتُ (in Cetus), and regarded<br>\
as the young ones of these.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,]<br>\
زَفَّ رَأْلُهُ (tropical:)  He was, or became, light of intellect,<br>\
lightwitted, or irresolute. (S and Z and TA in<br>\
art. زف.) And زَفَّ رَأْلِى (assumed tropical:)  I was, or became,<br>\
affected with sadness, or disquietude of mind, like<br>\
the young ostrich by reason of fear, or fright; a<br>\
phrase like شَالَتْ نَعَامَتُهُمْ meaning “ They were<br>\
frightened, and fled. ” (M.) And زَفَّ رَأْلُهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  They<br>\
perished, or died. (TA.) And خَوَّدَ رَأْلُهُ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
was, or became, frightened. (Ham p. 179.)<br>\
رُؤَالٌ and ↓ رَاؤُولٌ, (As, T, M, K, [the latter in<br>\
the CK رَاؤُل,]) with ء accord to ISk, and without ء accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, (M,TA,) The slaver of<br>\
a horse (As, ISk, T, M, K, TA) or similar beast,<br>\
(ISk, T,) that drops from him: (TA:) or his<br>\
froth, or foam: (K:) accord. to Lth, رُوَالٌ [q. v.<br>\
in art. رول, thus without ء,] signifies the spittle of<br>\
a horse or similar beast. (T.)<br>\
-A2-  Also the former,<br>\
(M,) or ↓ the latter, (K,) A redundance in [the<br>\
number of] the teeth of a horse or similar beast:<br>\
(M, K:) but As denies that these two words have<br>\
this meaning. (T. [See what next follows.])<br>\
رَائِلٌ and ↓ رَائِلَةٌ, accord. to Lth, signify A tooth<br>\
that grows to a horse or similar beast, preventing<br>\
him from drinking [with ease] and from [eating<br>\
in the manner termed] قَضْم: and accord. to En-Nadr, [the pl.] رَوَائِلُ signifies small teeth that<br>\
grow at the roots of the large teeth, and excavate<br>\
the roots of the latter so that these fall out: (T:)<br>\
but As disallows this. (TA. [See also art. رول:<br>\
and see the latter sentence of the next preceding<br>\
paragraph.])<br>\
رَائِلَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
