رَكَا (ISd, K,) [aor. يَرْكُو,] inf. n. رَكْوٌ,<br>\
(ISd, TA,) He dug, or excavated, (ISd, K, TA,)<br>\
the ground, forming an oblong hollow. (ISd,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He made, formed, or fashioned, in a<br>\
suitable manner, a small watering-trough such as<br>\
is termed مَرْكُوّ, (AZ, TA,) or a watering-trough<br>\
[in an absolute sense]; as also ↓ اركى. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَرْكَوَ see what next precedes.<br>\
رَكْوَةٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and رِكْوَةٌ and<br>\
رُكْوَةٌ, (K,) all well known, but the first is the<br>\
most chaste, (MF,) A certain thing for water:<br>\
(S:) it is [a small drinking-vessel] like a تَوْر, of<br>\
leather; (ISd, TA;) a small drinking-vessel of<br>\
skin: (Nh, TA:) or a small دَلْو [or bucket,<br>\
generally of leather], (Mgh, Msb,) well known:<br>\
(Msb:) all of these explanations have been<br>\
strangely neglected by the author of the K:<br>\
(TA:) pl. رِكَآءٌ (S, Mgh, Msb) and رَكَوَاتٌ; (S,)<br>\
Msb;) the latter allowable. (Msb.) The prov.<br>\
(S) صَارَتِ القَوْسُ رَكْوَةً [lit. The bow became a<br>\
ركوة, app. meaning the bow became exchanged<br>\
for a vessel such as is called ركوة, but see what<br>\
follows,] is applied in relation to the retiring of<br>\
good fortune, and reverse in the state of affairs.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A small زَوْرَق [or skiff]. (ISd, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  A رُقْعَة [or piece of cloth, or rag,] beneath the<br>\
عَوَاصِر, (K,) which means three stones [with<br>\
which grapes are pressed so as to force out the<br>\
juice,] placed one above another: so in the M.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence, accord. to the TK, the prov.<br>\
above mentioned: but I see not why.] ―<br>\
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
فَلْهَم of a woman; i. e. her فَرْج [or vulva]: so in<br>\
the copies of the K: but in the T, her قُلْفَة [i. e.<br>\
the prepuce of the clitoris], on the authority of<br>\
IAar; as being likened to the ركوة of water:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. [app. in all its senses] is رِكَآءٌ and<br>\
رَكَوَاتٌ [as above], (K,) or in the last sense رُكًى.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رَكِىٌّ: see what next follows, in two places.<br>\
رَكِيَّةٌ A well: (S, Msb, K:) or a well containing water; (MA;) otherwise a well is not<br>\
thus called: (Durrat el-Ghowwás, in De Sacy&#39;s<br>\
Chrest. Ar. ii. 332:) or a well not made neat; or<br>\
not constructed [or cased] with bricks [&amp;c.]:<br>\
(MA:) pl. رَكَايَا (S, Msb, K) and ↓ رَكِىٌّ, (S,<br>\
and so in some copies of the K,) or the former is<br>\
the pl. and ↓ the latter is [properly speaking] a<br>\
gen. n., [i. e. a coll. gen. n.,] and often occurs as<br>\
a sing. and as a pl., (Nh, TA,) or the pl. is also<br>\
رُكِىٌّ: (so in some copies of the K and in the<br>\
TA:) accord. to ISd, it is from رَكَا in the first of<br>\
the senses assigned to this verb above. (TA.)<br>\
مَرْكُوٌّ [pass. part. n. of 1: ―<br>\
-b2-  and hence, as a<br>\
subst.,] A large watering-trough or tank: (AA,<br>\
T, S, K:) [in the S and K is added, وَالجُرْمُوزُ الصَّغِيرُ,<br>\
which may mean either that the small watering-<br>\
trough is called جرموز, and such is the case, or<br>\
that مَرْكُوٌّ also signifies a small جرموز, agreeably<br>\
with what here follows, and with an explanation<br>\
of this word in the TA voce حَوِىٌّ:] Az, after<br>\
mentioning AA&#39;s explanation given above, says,<br>\
but what I have heard from the Arabs is, that the<br>\
مركوّ is a small watering-trough or tank, which<br>\
a man makes, or forms, or  fashions, in a suitable<br>\
manner, with his hands, at the head of the well,<br>\
when he has not, and cannot procure, a vessel in<br>\
which to give water to a camel or to two camels:<br>\
and that which is large is not thus called. (TA.)<br>\
[But see an ex. voce سَلْسٌ.]<br>\
