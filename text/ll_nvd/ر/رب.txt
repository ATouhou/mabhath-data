رَبَّهُ, (M, K,) aor.<br>\
رَبُ3َ, inf. n. رَبٌّ, (M,) [He<br>\
was, or became, its رَبّ, or lord, possessor, owner,<br>\
&amp;c.;] he possessed, or owned, it; had possession of<br>\
it, and command, or authority, over it; (M, K;)<br>\
namely, a thing; (K;) syn. مَلَكَهُ. (M, K.) [And<br>\
in like manner, He was, or became, his رَبّ, or<br>\
lord, &amp;c.] You say, رَبَبْتُ القَوْمَ, [inf. n. as above<br>\
and مَرَبَّةٌ and رِبَابَةٌ,] I ruled, or governed, the<br>\
people; syn. سُسْتُهُمْ; i. e. I was, or became, over<br>\
them [as their lord, master, or chief]. (S.) And<br>\
طَالَتْ مَرَبَّتُهُمُ النَّاسَ and رِبَابَتُهُم Their ruling, or<br>\
governing, the people continued long. (M, K. *)<br>\
The saying of Safwán, (T, S,) on the day of<br>\
Honeyn, (T,) لَأَنْ يَرُبَّنِى رَجُلٌ مِنْ قُرَيْشٍ أَحَبُّ إِلَىَّ<br>\
مِنْ أُنْ يَرُبَّنِى رَجُلٌ مِنْ هَوَازِنَ means [Assuredly<br>\
that a man of Kureysh] should be over me (T, S)<br>\
as رَبّ [or lord, &amp;c.], and as master, or chief,<br>\
having command, or authority, over me, (T,) [is<br>\
more pleasing to me than that a man of Hawázin<br>\
should be lord, &amp;c., over me.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S, M,<br>\
Mgh, K,) aor.<br>\
رَبُ3َ, (S, M,) inf. n. رَبٌّ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
M,) He reared, fostered, brought up, fed, or<br>\
nourished, him; i. q. رَبَّاهُ; (S, M, Mgh, K;)<br>\
namely, his child, (S,) or a child, (M, K,) either<br>\
his own or another&#39;s; taking good care of him,<br>\
and acting as his guardian, (M,) until he attained<br>\
to puberty, or to the utmost term of youth: (M,<br>\
K:) and so ↓ ربّبهُ, (Lh, S, M, Mgh, K,) or this<br>\
has a more emphatic signification, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
تَربِيبٌ (Lh, M, Mgh, K) and تَرِبَّةٌ; (Lh, M, K;)<br>\
and ↓ تربّبه; (S, M, K;) and ↓ ارتبّهُ: (M, K:)<br>\
[in like manner, also,] ↓ رَبْرَبَ signifies he reared,<br>\
fostered, or brought up, an orphan: (AA, T:)<br>\
and accord. to IDrd, (M,) رَبِبْتُهُ is a dial. var. [of<br>\
رَبَبْتُهُ]: (M, K:) he says also that the verb is<br>\
used in like manner in relation to the young one<br>\
of an animal other than man; and he used to cite<br>\
this ex.:<br>\
كَانَ لَنَا وَهْوَ فَلُوٌّ نِرْبِبُهْ<br>\
[He belonged to us when he was a young weaned,<br>\
or one-year-old, colt, we rearing him]; with<br>\
the letter characteristic of the aor. meksoor, to<br>\
show that the second letter of the preterite is<br>\
meksoor, accord to the opinion of Sb in respect<br>\
of a case of this kind; and this, he says, is peculiar to the dial. of Hudheyl in this species of verb.<br>\
(M, TA.) رَبَّتِ المَرْأَةُ صَبِيَّهَا, used tropically,<br>\
means (tropical:)  The woman patted her child repeatedly<br>\
on its side in order that it might sleep. (A, TA.)<br>\
[See 2 in art. ربت.] [It is said that] the primary<br>\
signification of الرَّبُّ is التَّرْبِيَةُ; i. e. The bringing<br>\
a thing to a state of completion by degrees. (Bd<br>\
in i. l.) A poet says, (S,) namely, Hassán<br>\
Ibn-Thábit, (TA,)<br>\
مِنْ دُرَّةٍ بَيْضَآءَ صَافِيَةٍ<br>\
حَائِرُ البَحْرِ ↓ مِمَّا تَرَبَّبَ<br>\
[Than a white, clear, pearl, of those which the<br>\
depth of the sea has brought to maturity]; meaning a pearl which the shell has reared, or brought<br>\
to maturity in the bottom of the water. (S, TA.)<br>\
And the phrase لَكَ نِعْمَةٌ تَرُبُّهَا occurs in a trad.,<br>\
meaning [Thou hast wealth] which thou preservest, and of which thou takest care, and which<br>\
thou fosterest like as the man fosters his child.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] المَطَرُ يَرُبُّ النَّبَاتَ وَالثَّرَى The<br>\
rain causes the plants, or herbage, and the moisture [of the earth] to increase. (M.) And<br>\
السَّحَابُ يَرُبُّ المَطَرَ The clouds collect and increase<br>\
the rain. (M.) And رَبَّ, (T, S, M, K, TA,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
رَبُ3َ, inf. n. رَبٌّ and رِبَابٌ and رِبَابَةٌ; (Lh, M,<br>\
TA;) and ↓ ربّب; (M, TA;) (tropical:)  He increased,<br>\
(M, K, TA,) or rightly disposed, and completed,<br>\
(T, S,) a benefit, or benefaction. (T, S, M, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  رَبَّ الأَمْرَ, (M, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
رَبُ3َ , inf. n. رَبٌّ<br>\
(M, Msb) and رِبَابَةٌ, (M,) (tropical:)  He put the affair<br>\
into a right, or proper, state; adjusted it, arranged it, ordered it, or rightly disposed it;<br>\
(M, K;) and established it firmly: (M:) or he<br>\
managed, conducted, or regulated, the affair:<br>\
(Msb:) [perhaps from رَبَّ signifying “ he reared,”<br>\
&amp;c.; but more probably, I think, from what next<br>\
follows.] ―<br>\
-b5-  رَبَّ, (T, S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
رَبُ3َ, (T, M,)<br>\
inf. n. رَبُّ (T, M, K) and رُبٌّ; (K) and ↓ ربّب;<br>\
(M;) He seasoned a skin (T, S, K) for clarified<br>\
butter (T, S) with رُبّ [i. e. rob, or inspissated<br>\
juice], (T, S, K,) of dates, (TA,) which imparts<br>\
a good odour to it, (S, TA,) and prevents the<br>\
flavour and odour of the butter from being spoiled:<br>\
(TA:) or he seasoned a skin with رُبّ, and a jar<br>\
with tar or pitch: or, as some say, رَبَبْتُهُ signifies<br>\
I smeared it over, and prepared it properly.<br>\
(M.) ↓ رَبَّ and ↓ ربّب, (K,) or the latter,<br>\
but the former also is allowable, (M,) (tropical:)  He made<br>\
oil, or ointment, good, and sweet, or fragrant, or<br>\
he perfumed it, (M, K, * TA,) accord. to Lh, by<br>\
infusing in it jasmine or some other sweet-smelling<br>\
plant. (M, TA.) See also مُرَبَّبٌ, below. ―<br>\
-b6-  رَبَّ<br>\
also signifies He collected, or congregated, (K,<br>\
TA,) people: (TA:) [and so, probably, ↓ ربّب:<br>\
see رَبَبٌ.] You say, فُلَانٌ يَرُبُّ النَّاسَ Such a one<br>\
collects, or congregates, to him the people. (T,<br>\
S, M.)<br>\
-A2-  رَبَّ, aor.<br>\

inf. n. رَبٌّ, (M, TA,) or رِبَابٌ, (S, K, [in each<br>\
of which this is mentioned as the inf. n. whence<br>\

brought forth: (Lh, M, K:) or, as some say,<br>\
she conceived: or, accord. to some, there is no<br>\
verb to the epithet رُبَّى: (M:) AZ says that it<br>\
has no verb: (Msb:) [but] ↓ رِبَابٌ is an inf. n.<br>\
used in relation to a ewe or she-goat as meaning<br>\
her being in the state of such as is termed رُبَّى<br>\
[q. v.]: (S, M, * Msb, * K: *) and in relation to<br>\
a she-camel, as in the ex. cited by Munteji&#39; Ibn-Nebhán to As,<br>\
حَنِينَ أُمِّ البَوِّفِى رِبَابِهَا<br>\
[The yearning cry of the mother of the young<br>\
camel in the time of her having recently brought<br>\
forth]: (S:) and used also in relation to a<br>\
woman as meaning her having recently brought<br>\
forth: or her state within two months after<br>\
having brought forth: or within twenty days:<br>\
whence the phrase, in a trad., حَمْلُهَا رِبَابٌ, meaning She becomes pregnant soon after having<br>\
brought forth. (TA.)<br>\

رَبْرَبَ: see 1.<br>\
رَبْ: see رَأَبَ, of which it is an imperative.<br>\
رُبَ and رَبَ and رُبُ and رُبْ and رَبْ; and رُبَمَا<br>\
and رَبَمَا &amp;c.: see رُبَّ.<br>\
رَبٌ: see the next paragraph, last sentence<br>\
but one.<br>\
رَبٌّ A lord, a possessor, an owner, or a proprietor, syn. مَالِكٌ, (T, IAmb, S, M, A, Msb, K,)<br>\
of a thing, (T,) of anything, (S, M, A, K,) or of<br>\
an irrational thing; (Msb;) a person who has a<br>\
right, or just title or claim, to the possession of<br>\
anything; or its صَاحِب [which is syn. with مَالِك];<br>\
(M, A, K;) رَبٌّ and مَالِكٌ and صَاحِبٌ all signifying in Pers. خُدَاوَنْد: (KL:) and a lord,<br>\
master, or chief; (Msb, TA;) or a lord, master,<br>\
or chief, to whom obedience is paid: (IAmb,<br>\
TA:) and a lord, ruler, governor, regulator, or<br>\
disposer; (TA;) an orderer, a rectifier, or a<br>\
reformer: (IAmb, TA:) a rearer, fosterer,<br>\
bringer-up, feeder, or nourisher: and a completer, or an accomplisher: (TA:) it is an<br>\
epithet, like نَمٌّ from نَمَّ: or an inf. n. used as an<br>\
intensive epithet; like عَدْلٌ; (Ksh and Bd * in<br>\
i. l;) originally signifying the “ bringing (a thing)<br>\
to a state of completion by degrees;” (Bd, ibid.;)<br>\
then used in the sense of مَالِكٌ: (Ksh and Bd<br>\
ibid.:) the pl. [of pauc.] is أَرْبَابٌ and [of mult.]<br>\
رُبُوبٌ, (M, K,) and accord. to Sh, رِبَابٌ also,<br>\
(TA,) signifying أَصْحَابٌ, (K,) and ↓ رَبُوبٌ is<br>\
app. a quasi-pl. n.: (M:) the fem. is ↓ رَبَّةٌ; of<br>\
which the pl. is رَبَّاتٌ. (T.) Whoever possesses a<br>\
thing is its رَبّ: you say, هُوَ رَبُّ الدَّابَّةِ [He is the<br>\
possessor, or owner, or master, of the beast], and<br>\
الدَّارِ [of the house], (T,) and المَالِ [of the property, or cattle]; (Msb;) and البَيْتِ ↓ هِىَ رَبَّةُ<br>\
[She is the owner, or mistress, of the house or<br>\
tent]. (T.) With the article ال, it is [properly]<br>\
applied only to God: (T, S, M, A, Msb, K:) He<br>\
is رَبُّ الأَرْبَابِ [The Lord of lords]. (T. [Thus<br>\
the pl. with the article ال is applied to created<br>\
beings.]) To any other being it is not [properly]<br>\
applied but as a prefixed noun governing another<br>\
noun as its complement in the gen. case [or in a<br>\
similar manner]. (S.) The pagan Arabs, however, sometimes applied it to A king, (S,) or to a<br>\
lord as meaning a master or chief: (Msb:) El-<br>\
Hárith says, (S, Msb,) i. e. Ibn-Hillizeh, (S,)<br>\
وَهُوَ الرَّبُّ وَالشَّهِيدُ عَلَى يُوْ<br>\
مِ الحِيَارَيْنِ وَالبَلَآءُ بَلَآءُ<br>\
(S, Msb,) i. e. And he (meaning El-Mundhir<br>\
Ibn-Má-es-Semà, or, as some say, &#39;Amr Ibn-Hind,) was the king [or lord] and witness of our<br>\
fighting on the day of El-Hiyárán (the name of<br>\
a place), and the trial was a hard trial. (EM,<br>\
p. 285: [in which الحَيَارَيْنِ is erroneously put for<br>\
الحِيَارَيْنِ.]) Some forbid that a man should be<br>\
called the رَبّ of his slave: (Msb:) it is said in a<br>\
trad. that the slave shall not say to his master,<br>\
رَبّى, because it is like attributing a partner to<br>\
God: (TA:) but رَبّ is sometimes used in the<br>\
sense of lord as meaning master or chief prefixed<br>\
to a noun signifying a rational being governed by<br>\
it in the gen. case: thus in the saying of the<br>\
Prophet, حَتَّى تَلِدَ الأَمَةُ رَبَّهَا [So that the female<br>\
slave shall bring forth him who will become<br>\
her master], or ↓ رَبَّتَهَا [her mistress], accord. to<br>\
different transmitters; (Msb;) relating to the<br>\
signs of the hour of resurrection: i. e., the female<br>\
slave shall bring forth to her master a child that<br>\
shall be as a master [or mistress] to her because<br>\
like his [or her] father in rank: meaning that<br>\
captives and concubines shall be numerous.<br>\
(TA.) As to the phrase in the Kur [xii. 42],<br>\
اُذْكُرْنِى عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ [Mention thou me in the presence of thy lord], Joseph thus addressed his<br>\
fellow-prisoner agreeably with the acceptation in<br>\
which he [the latter] understood the words. (TA.)<br>\
A similar instance also occurs in the same chapter,<br>\
in the verse immediately preceding. (Msb.) In<br>\
another verse, [23 of the same ch.,] إِنَّهُ رَبِّى<br>\
[Verily he is my lord] may refer to Joseph&#39;s<br>\
master or to God. (M, TA.) The words of the<br>\
Kur [lxxxix. 28 and 29], اِرْجِعِى إِلَى رَبِّكِ رَاضِيَةً<br>\
مَرْضِيَّةً فَادْخُلِى فِى عَبْدىِ, as some read, [instead<br>\
of عِبَادِى,] may mean Return to thine owner,<br>\
[approving, approved,] and enter into my servant.<br>\
(M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Without the article ال, as some<br>\
say, (L, TA,) it is sometimes written and pronounced ↓ رَبٌ, without teshdeed; (L, K;) as in<br>\
the following verse, cited by El-Mufaddal,<br>\
وَقَدْ عَلِمَ الأَقْوَامُ أَنْ لَيْسَ فَوْقَهُ<br>\
رَبٌ غَيْرُ مَنْ يَعْطِى الحُظُوظَ وَيَرْزُقُ<br>\
[And the peoples have known that there is not<br>\
above him a lord beside Him who gives the portions of mankind and of others and grants the<br>\
means of subsistence]. (L.) And Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà [i. e. Th] mentions the phrase لَا وَرَبِيكَ لَا<br>\
أَفْعَلُ, for لَا وَرَبِّكَ [i. e. No, by thy Lord, I will<br>\
not do such a thing]; the [latter] ب being changed<br>\
into ى because of the reduplication. (M, K: * in<br>\
the CK رَبْيِكَ.)<br>\
رُبَّ is a word of which there are seventy dial.<br>\
vars., all mentioned by Zekereeyà El-Ansáree in<br>\
his great Expos. of the “ Munferijeh,” but only<br>\
eighteen of which are mentioned in the K, including some that are formed with the affix ت,<br>\
some with the affix مَا, and some with both these<br>\
affixes together; as follows: (TA:) رُبَّ (T, S, M,<br>\
Msb, Mughnee, K, &amp;c.) and رَبَّ (T, M, Mughnee, K) and رُبُّ, (Mughnee,) and ↓ رُبَ (T, S, M,<br>\
Mughnee, K) and رَبَ (T, M, Mughnee, K) and<br>\
رُبُ and رُبْ (Mughnee, K) and رَبْ; (Mughnee;)<br>\
and ↓ رُبَّتَ (T, S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K) and رَبَّتَ<br>\
(M, Mughnee, K) and رُبُّتَ and رُبَّتُ and رَبَّتُ and<br>\
رُبُّتُ and رُبَّتِ and رَبَّتِ and رُبُّتِ and رَبُّت (TA)<br>\
and رُبَّتْ and رَبَّتْ (Mughnee) and رُبُّتْ, (TA,)<br>\
and ↓ رُبَتَ (T, Mughnee, K) and رَبَتَ (Mughnee,<br>\
K) and رُبُتَ and رُبْتَ and رَبْتَ and رُبَتُ and رَبَتُ<br>\
and رُبُتُ and رُبْتُ and رَبْتُ and رُبَتِ and رَبَتِ and<br>\
رُبُتِ and رَبُتِ and رُبْتِ and رَبْتِ (TA) and رُبَتْ<br>\
and رَبَتْ (Mughnee) and رُبُتْ; (TA;) and رُبَّمَا<br>\
(T, S, M, K) and رَبَّمَا (M, K) and رُبُّمَا, (TA,)<br>\
and ↓ رُبَمَا (T, K) and رَبَمَا (K) and رُبُمَا and رُبْمَا<br>\
and رَبْمَا; (TA;) and ↓ رُبَّتَمَا (T, S, M, K) and<br>\
رَبَّتَمَا (M, K) and رُبُّتَمَا and رُبَّتُمَا and رَبَّتُمَا and رُبُّتُمَا<br>\
and رُبَّتْمَا and رَبَّتْمَا and رُبُّتْمَا, (TA,) and ↓ رُبَتَمَا<br>\
and رَبَتَمَا (M, K) and رُبُتَمَا and رُبْتَمَا and رَبْتَمَا and<br>\
رُبَتُمَا and رَبَتُمَا and رُبُتُمَا and رُبْتُمَا and رَبْتُمَا and<br>\
رُبَتْمَا and رَبَتْمَا and رُبُتْمَا: (TA:) [of all these, the<br>\
most common are رُبَّ and رُبَّمَا: and] ↓ رُبَّتَ is the<br>\
most common of the forms that have the affix ت:<br>\
(Mughnee and K on the letter ت:) and the forms<br>\
with teshdeed are more common than the [corresponding] forms without teshdeed. (M.) It is<br>\
a word, (M,) or particle, (T, S, Mughnee, K,)<br>\
governing the gen. case: (S, M, Mughnee, K:)<br>\
or a noun, (K, TA,) [i. e. an indecl. noun,] in<br>\
the opinion of the Koofees and some others; but<br>\
this opinion is rejected by Ibn-Málik in the Tesheel and its Expos., and by AHei, and by IHsh<br>\
in the Mughnee. (TA.) Accord. to some, (K,<br>\
TA,) it is used to denote a small number, (T, M,<br>\
Msb, K, TA,) always, (TA,) or mostly: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) [thus it may be rendered Few if we render<br>\
the noun following it as a pl.; and scarce any if<br>\
we render the noun following as a sing. or a pl.:]<br>\
it is the contr. of كَمْ when this latter is not used<br>\
interrogatively: (T:) [and with مَا affixed, restricting it from government, it may be rendered<br>\
Few times, or seldom:] or it is used to denote a<br>\
large number; (K, TA;) i. e. always: so says<br>\
IDrst: (TA:) [thus used, but such is not always<br>\
the case, it may be rendered Many, whether we<br>\
render the noun following it as a sing. or as a pl.:<br>\
and with مَا affixed, Many times, many a time,<br>\
oftentimes, ofttimes, often, or frequently:] or it<br>\
is used to denote a small and a large number;<br>\
(Mughnee, K;) often the latter, and seldom the<br>\
former: (Mughnee:) or it is used in a case of<br>\
boasting, or glorying, (K, TA,) exclusively of<br>\
other cases, (TA,) to denote a large number:<br>\
(K, TA:) or it does not denote by itself either a<br>\
small number or a large number; but one or the<br>\
other of these meanings is inferred from the context: (K:) [but sometimes neither of these meanings can be clearly inferred from the context: in<br>\
these cases, it may be rendered Some: and with<br>\
مَا affixed, Sometimes:] accord. to Er-Radee, its<br>\
primary meaning is to denote a small number,<br>\
but it has been so much used to denote a large<br>\
number as to be in this latter sense as though it<br>\
were proper, and in the former sense as though it<br>\
were tropical, requiring context [to explain it].<br>\
(Marginal note in my copy of the Mughnee.)<br>\
[Without the affix ما,] it governs an indeterminate noun (T, * S, Msb, Mughnee, K) only,<br>\
(T, S, K,) and a pronoun. (S, M, Mughnee.)<br>\
You say, رُبَّ يَوْمٍ بَكَّرْتُ فِيهِ [Few, or many, days<br>\
have I gone forth early therein]: (T:) and<br>\
رُبَّ رَجُلٍ قَائِمٌ [Few, or many, men are standing]:<br>\
(M:) and رُبَّ رَجُلٍ قَامَ [Few, or many, men<br>\
stood]: (Msb:) and in like manner, رَجُلٍ ↓ رُبَّتَ;<br>\
(Msb;) for the ت in this case is not a denotative<br>\
of the fem. gender. (Msb.) The pronoun affixed<br>\
to it is of the third pers., (S, M,) and is [generally] sing. and masc., (S, Mughnee,) though it<br>\
may be followed by a fem. and by a dual and by<br>\
a pl.: (S:) notwithstanding its being determinate<br>\
in the utmost degree, its use in this manner is<br>\
allowable because it resembles an indeterminate<br>\
noun in its being used without the previous mention of the noun to which it relates; and hence it<br>\
requires a noun to explain it: (IJ, M:) it annuls<br>\
the government of رُبَّ; (TA;) and the indeterminate noun that follows it is put in the accus.<br>\
case as a specificative: (S, Mughnee:) thus you<br>\
say, رُبَّهُ رَجُلًا قَدْ ضَرَبْتُ [Few, or many, men I<br>\
have beaten]: (S, M: *) but accord. to the Koofees, you say رُبَّهُ رَجُلًا, (S,) and رُبَّهَا امْرَأَةً, (M,)<br>\
and رُبَّهُمَا رَجُلَيْنش, and رُبَّهُمْ رِجَالًا, and رُبَّهُنَّ نِسَآءً:<br>\
he who puts the pronoun in the sing. [in all<br>\
cases] holds it to be allusive to something unknown; and he who does not put it in the sing.<br>\
[when it is not followed by a sing. noun] holds it<br>\
to be used in reply to a question, as though it<br>\
were said to a man, “Hast thou not any young<br>\
women? ” and he answered, رُبَّهُنَّ جَوَارٍ قَدْ مَلَكْتُ<br>\
[Few, or many, young women have I possessed]:<br>\
Ibn-Es-Sarráj says that the grammarians are as<br>\
though they were of one consent in holding رُبَّ<br>\
to be a replicative [app. meaning in a case of this<br>\
kind, with an affixed pronoun]: (S:) [but it is<br>\
not always a replicative in a case of this kind;<br>\
though perhaps it was originally:] AHeyth cites<br>\
as an ex.<br>\
وَرُبَّهُ عَطِبًا أَنْقَذْتُ مِ العَطَبِ<br>\
[And many a perishing man have I saved from<br>\
perdition]. (TA. [But the reading commonly<br>\
found in grammars is مِنْ عَطَبِهْ from his state of<br>\
perdition.]) The following is an ex. of the use of<br>\
رُبَّ to denote a small number, [or rather to denote<br>\
singleness,]<br>\
أَلَا رُبَّ مَوْلُودٍ وَلَيْسَ لَهُ أَبٌ<br>\
وَذِى وَلَدٍ لَمْ يَلْدِهِ أَبَوَانِ<br>\
[Now surely scarce an instance is there of anyone<br>\
born not having a father, and of anyone having<br>\
offspring whom two parents have not procreated];<br>\
meaning [our Lord] Jesus and Adam: (Mughnee: [but I have substituted يَلْدِهِ for يَلْدَهُ, the<br>\
reading in my copy of that work: لَمْ يَلْدِهِ is for<br>\
لَمْ يَلِدْهُ, for the sake of the metre; like as لِمْ أَجْدِ<br>\
is for لَمْ أَجِدْ:]) and among the many exs. of its<br>\
use to denote a large number, is the saying, in a<br>\
trad., يَا رُبَّ كاَسِيَةٍ فِى الدُّنْيَا عَارِيَةٌ يَوْمَ القِيٰمَةِ [O,<br>\
many a female having clothing in the present state<br>\
of existence will be naked on the day of resurrection!]; and the saying of an Arab of the desert,<br>\
after the ending of Ramadán, يَا رُبَّ صَائِمِهِ لَنْ<br>\
يَعصُومَهُ وَيَا رُبَّ قَائِمِهِ لَنْ يَقُومَهُ [O, many a keeper<br>\
of its fast shall not keep its fast again! and O,<br>\
many a passer of its nights in prayer, or per-<br>\
former of its تَرَاوِيح, shall not pass its nights in<br>\
prayer, or perform its تراويح, again!]. (Mughnee.) [But in this last ex., and in others, it relates<br>\
to few in comparison with others, though many<br>\
abstractedly.] ―<br>\
-b2-  مَا is affixed to رُبَّ &amp;c. in order<br>\
that a verb may follow it; (S, Mughnee;) and<br>\
the verb that follows it is generally a preterite,<br>\
(T, Mughnee,) as to the letter and the meaning:<br>\
(Mughnee:) you say, رُبَّمَا جَآءَنِى فُلَانٌ [Seldom,<br>\
or often, such a one came to me, or has come to<br>\
me]: (T:) sometimes the verb is a future; (T,<br>\
Mughnee;) but only when it expresses an event<br>\
of which one is certain: (T:) so in the saying in<br>\
the Kur [xv. 2], رُبَّمَا يَوَدُّ الَّذينَ كَفَرُوا لَوْ كَانُوا<br>\
مُسْلِمِينَ, (T, S, M, Mughnee), meaning Often<br>\
[will those who have disbelieved wish that they<br>\
had been Muslims]; (Mughnee, Jel;) or seldom,<br>\
(Zj, T, M, Jel,) because terrors will bereave them<br>\
of their reason so that they will but seldom recover reason to wish this; (Jel;) for God&#39;s<br>\
threat is true, as though it had come to pass, and<br>\
therefore the verb here is equivalent to a preterite [which is often used in the Kur and elsewhere in this manner]. (T.) مَا is also sometimes<br>\
affixed when a noun follows, (T, Mughnee,) or a<br>\
nominal proposition, and generally restricts رُبَّ<br>\
&amp;c. from governing: thus, Aboo-Duwád says,<br>\
رُبَّمَا الجَامِلُ المُؤَبَّلُ فِيهِمْ<br>\
وَعَنَا جِيجُ بَيْنَهُنَّ المِهَارُ<br>\
[Sometimes, or often, the numerous herd of camels<br>\
is among them, and there are swift horses, among<br>\
which are the colts]: another says, making رُبَّ,<br>\
with مَا affixed, to govern,<br>\
رُبَّمَا ضَرْبَةٍ بِسَيْفٍ صَقِيلٍ<br>\
قَيْنِ بُصْرَى وَطَعْنَةٍ نَجْلَآءَ<br>\
[Many a stroke with a polished sword of the<br>\
forging of Busrà, (the Bozrah of the Bible, a<br>\
city famous for its sword-blades,) and many a<br>\
wide spear-wound; or, perhaps, few strokes &amp;c.]:<br>\
(Mughnee: [but I have substituted قَيْنِ for بَيْنَ,<br>\
which is the reading in my copy of the Mughnee,<br>\
an evident mistranscription:]) and another, cited<br>\
by IAar, says,<br>\
غَارَةٍ ↓ مَاوِىَّ يَا رُبَّتَمَا<br>\
شَعْوَآءَ كَاللَّذْعَةِ بِالْمِيسَمِ<br>\
[Máweeyeh, (مَاوِىَّ being an apocopated proper<br>\
name of a woman, originally مَاوِيَّةُ,) O, many a<br>\
raid spreading widely and dispersedly, like the<br>\
burn with the branding-iron]. (T. [In the TT,<br>\
as from the T, I find, here, بَلْ in the place of يا,<br>\
which I find in a copy of the T, and which is<br>\
the reading commonly known.])<br>\
رُبٌّ Rob, or inspissated juice, (دِبْس,) of any<br>\
fruit; i. e., (M, TA,) the first, or clear, juice of<br>\
the thick residuum of any fruit after it has been<br>\
pressed (M, K, TA) and cooked: (M, TA:) thick<br>\
طِلَآء [or expressed juice; such as the inspissated<br>\
juice of dates, with which a skin for clarified<br>\
butter is seasoned; see 1, in the latter half of the<br>\
paragraph]: (S:) or what flows from fresh ripe<br>\
dates, like honey, when it has been cooked [and<br>\
so rendered thick]; before which it is called صَقْرٌ:<br>\
(Msb in the present art. and in art. صقر:) what<br>\
is prepared by coction from, or of, dates: (TA:)<br>\
expressed juice of grapes, and of apples, &amp;c.,<br>\
cooked and [so] thickened: (KL:) and dregs,<br>\
(K,) or black dregs, (IDrd, M,) of clarified<br>\
butter, (IDrd, M, K,) and of olive-oil: (IDrd,<br>\
M:) pl. رُبُوبٌ and رِبَابٌ (S) [and pl. pl. (i. e. pl.<br>\
of رُبُوبٌ) رُبُوبَاتٌ, which means sorts, or species, of<br>\
رُبّ]<br>\
-A2-  See also رُبَّى.<br>\
رَبَّةٌ: see رَبٌّ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  الرَّبَّةُ was also<br>\
the name of A Kaabeh [or square temple],<br>\
(M, K,) in Nejrán, (M,) belonging to [the tribe<br>\
of] Medh-hij (M, K) and Benu-l-Hárith-Ibn-Kaab, who held it in honour. (M.) In a trad. of<br>\
&#39;Orweh (K, TA) Ibn-Mes&#39;ood Eth-Thakafee,<br>\
(TA,) it is applied to El-Lát (اللَّاتُ), (K, TA,)<br>\
the rock which [the tribe of] Thakeef worshipped,<br>\
at Et-Táïf. (TA.) And in another trad., it is<br>\
said to be the name of A temple of [the tribe of]<br>\
Thakeef, which, when they became Muslims, was<br>\
demolished by El-Mugheereh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
رَبَّةٌ, (K,) or دَارٌ رَبَّةٌ, (M,) signifies A large house<br>\
or mansion. (M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also رُبَّى.<br>\
رُبَّةٌ A party, division, sect, or distinct body or<br>\
class, of men: (M:) or a large assembly or company: (K:) or a myriad; i. e. ten thousand:<br>\
(M, K:) or thereabout: (M:) and ↓ رِبّةٌ signifies<br>\
the same: (M, K:) or this signifies a company<br>\
[of men]: (T:) the pl. of the former is رِبَابٌ:<br>\
(S, M:) and that of the latter is أَرِبَّةٌ: (T, K:)<br>\
by Th [and in the K], the former pl. is said to be<br>\
a pl. of رِبَّةٌ; but this is a mistake. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence, the pl.] رِبَابٌ signifies Companions. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And hence [also], i. e., as pl. of الرُّبَةُ, (S, M,)<br>\
الرِّبَابُ is an appellation of The [confederate]<br>\
tribes of Dabbeh; (M, K, TA;) or Teym and<br>\
&#39;Adee and &#39;Okl; (T, TA;) or Teym and &#39;Adee<br>\
and &#39;Owf and Thowr and Ashyab; (TA; [but<br>\
for the orthography of the last of these names I<br>\
have found no authority; it is written in the TA<br>\
اشيب, without any syll. signs;]) and Dabbeh<br>\
was their paternal uncle; (TA;) or five tribes<br>\
which united in a confederacy, consisting of<br>\
Dabbeh and Thowr and &#39;Okl and Teym and<br>\
&#39;Adee: (S:) they were thus called because of<br>\
their division into distinct bodies; (M;) or because<br>\
they collected themselves (As, Th, S, TA) in distinct bodies: (Th, M, TA:) or because they<br>\
united in a confederacy against Temeem Ibn-Murr: (AO, M, TA:) or because they dipped<br>\
their hands in some رُبّ, and formed a confederacy<br>\
over it: (As, T, M, K:) or, as some say, because<br>\
they congregated, and became like the رِبَاب [or<br>\
bundle] of arrows [used in the game called<br>\
المَيْسِر]: (TA:) the rel. n. is ↓ رُبِّىٌّ, formed from<br>\
the sing., (Sb, S, M,) accord. to a rule generally<br>\
observed except when a [single] man has a pl.<br>\
word for his name, as كِلَابٌ &amp;c. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
The sing. (رُبَّةٌ) also signifies Plenty, or abundance, of the means of subsistence: (K:) and<br>\
constant, or inseparable, prosperity. (Khálid<br>\
Ibn-Jembeh, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also رُبَّى.<br>\
رِبَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, first<br>\
sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence its pl.] أَرِبَّةٌ signifies Confederates; (S, IB, K;) [or] it is for ذَوُو أَرِبَّةٍ<br>\
having covenants; أَرِبَّةٌ being said by AAF to be<br>\
pl. of رِبَابٌ in the sense of عَهْدٌ. (IB, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also A species of plant, (S, M, Msb, K,) of the<br>\
[season called] صَيْف, (M,) remaining in the end<br>\
of the صَيْف: (Msb:) or the name of a number of<br>\
plants which do not dry up in the صَيْف, remaining green in the winter and the صيف [or summer];<br>\
among which are the حُلَّب and the رُخَامَى and<br>\
the مَكْر and the عَلْقَى or عَلْقًى: [see رَبْلٌ:] or<br>\
a certain soft, or tender, herb, or leguminous<br>\
plant: (TA:) or any plant that is green in the<br>\
hot season: or certain species of trees, or of plants,<br>\
undefined: (M:) pl. رِبَبٌ. (S, Msb.) [In the<br>\
dial. of Egypt, Alexandrian trefoil (بِرْسِيم, q. v.,)<br>\
of the second and third crops.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A certain tree: as some say, the tree of the خَرُّوب [an<br>\
appellation generally applied to the carob, or<br>\
locust-tree]. (M, K.)<br>\
رَبَبٌ, (S, M, K,) or مَآءٌ رَبَبٌ, (S, TA,) Much<br>\
water, (S, M, K,) collected together: (M:) or<br>\
sweet-water: (S, K:) accord. to Th, it means<br>\
مَا رَبَّبَهُ الطِينُ [app. such (water) as the clay has<br>\
collected; for تَرَبَّبَ signifying تَجَمَّعَ is probably<br>\
quasi-pass. of رَبَّبَ, so that this last seems to signify جَمَّعَ]. (M.)<br>\
رُبَتَ and رَبَتَ &amp;c.; and رُبَتَمَا and رَبَتَمَا &amp;c.:<br>\
see رُبَّ.<br>\
رَبَابٌ Clouds: (M:) or white clouds: (S, K:)<br>\
or clouds that one sees beneath other clouds, (S,)<br>\
or clouds suspended beneath other clouds, (M,)<br>\
sometimes white and sometimes black: (S, M:)<br>\
this latter is said by IB to be the signification<br>\
commonly known: (TA:) or clouds consisting of<br>\
an accumulation of parts: (A &#39;Obeyd, T:) n. un.<br>\
with ة. (A &#39;Obeyd, S, K.) Hence الرَّبَابُ as a<br>\
proper name of a woman. (A &#39;Obeyd, T, S.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also A certain instrument of diversion, [meaning,<br>\
of music,] (K,) having strings, (TA,) with which<br>\
one plays [lit. beats]. (K.) [The رباب in common<br>\
use among the Arabs in the present day is a kind<br>\
of viol. A specimen of it is figured and described<br>\
in my work on the Modern Egyptians. Being<br>\
an instrument of remarkable simplicity, it is<br>\
probably similar to the ancient رباب.] Memdood<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Abd-Allah El-Wásitee Er-Rabábee became<br>\
proverbial for his musical skill with the رباب.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
-A3-  See also رُبَّانٌ.<br>\

-b2-  Also (tropical:)  Tithes,<br>\
or tenths; syn. عُشُورٌ: (S, M, K:) from the same<br>\
word signifying “ a covenant. ” (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  In the<br>\
phrase يُعْطِيهَا الأَمَانَ رِبَابُهَا, ending a verse of<br>\
Aboo-Dhu-eyb, describing some asses, رِبَاب is<br>\
said to signify An oath, or a promise, which the<br>\
owner of the asses takes of a people to permit<br>\
those asses to water: or the poet means that the<br>\
person giving those asses permission to water<br>\
gives to their owner an arrow, of those used in<br>\
the game called المَيْسِر, [as a token,] to show that<br>\
they have received permission to water, and that<br>\
no one may offer them any opposition: (TA:)<br>\
some say that رِبَابُهَا here means their owners:<br>\
(M:) [holding this last opinion,] Sh says that<br>\
رِبَاب in this verse is a pl. of رَبٌّ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  It is<br>\
also a pl. of رُبَّةٌ; (S, M;) not of رِبَّةٌ, as it is said<br>\
to be by Th [and in the K]. (M.)<br>\
-A3-  See also<br>\

nourished; [and taken good care of, until the<br>\
age of puberty; (see 1;)] as also ↓ مَرْبُوبٌ; (S,<br>\
M, K;) both applied to a boy: (S, M:) and in<br>\
like manner applied to a horse: (M:) or the<br>\
latter epithet, applied to a horse, (tropical:)  tended well,<br>\
or taken good care of: (A:) the former is also<br>\
applied to a gazelle; (IAar, K in art. دخل;) [as<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  brought up in, or near, the house or<br>\
tent, and there fed;] like أَهْلِىٌّ: (TA in that art.:)<br>\
and [its fem.] رَبِيبَةٌ is applied to a ewe or she-goat, (شَاةٌ, K,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  brought up in the tent,<br>\
or house, for the sake of her milk; (S, K; [see<br>\
also رُبَّى;]) pl. رَبَائِبُ; (S;) this last being applied<br>\
to sheep or goats that are tied near to the tents,<br>\
or houses, and there fed, and that do not go forth<br>\
to pasture; (M, TA;) of which it is said that<br>\
none are to be taken for the poor-rate. (TA.)<br>\

another husband; (T, M, A;) because he rears<br>\

-b3-  Also, and ↓ رَابٌّ, (T,<br>\
M, K,) both syn., like شَهِيدٌ and شَاهِدٌ, and خَبِيرٌ<br>\
and خَابِرٌ, (TA,) or the latter, (T, S,) mentioned<br>\
by IAar, is the correct term, (T,) [A step-father;]<br>\
the husband of a mother (T, S, M, K) who has a<br>\
child by another husband. (T.) And رَبِيبَةٌ and<br>\
↓ رَابَّةٌ, (T,) or the latter [only], (S, K,) [A stepmother;] the wife of a father (T, S, K) who has<br>\
a child by another wife. (T.) رَبِيبَةٌ also signifies [A foster-mother;] a woman who has the<br>\
charge of a child, who carries him, and takes<br>\
care of him, and rears, or fosters, him; (Th, S,<br>\
M, Msb, K;) like ↓ رَابَّةٌ; the former being of the<br>\
measure فَعِلَيةٌ in the sense of فَاعِلَةٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
أَربَّآءُ النَّبِىّ [meaning The foster-fathers of the<br>\
Prophet] is an appellation given to the people<br>\
[of the tribe of Saad] among whom Mohammad<br>\
was suckled; as though اربّآء were pl. of رَبِيبٌ [as<br>\
it is said to be in one of the senses mentioned<br>\
above]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And رَبِيبٌ signifies also A<br>\
confederate; a person with whom one unites in a<br>\
confederacy, league, or covenant. (M, K.) ―<br>\

small cord with which the arrows are bound<br>\
[together]: or the arrows [themselves] collectively:<br>\
(M, K:) sometimes it is used in this last sense:<br>\
