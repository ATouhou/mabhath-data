تَرْفِيلٌ The making a garment ample, or long<br>\
towards the ground: the letting it down, or making<br>\
it to hang down: (TA:) [and so ↓ إِرْفَالٌ:] you<br>\
say, ثِيَابَهُ ↓ ارفل, (Sh, T,) or ثَوْبَهُ, (M,) or رِفْلَهُ,<br>\

[like رَفَّدَهُ:] and he rendered him submissive;<br>\
made him to submit; or brought him under, or<br>\
into, subjection: (M, K:) thus it has two contr.<br>\
meanings; (K;) [like تَرَّفَهُ;] for when a man is<br>\
made judge in an affair, it is as though he were<br>\
subjected to service therein. (TA.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says,<br>\
إِذَا نَحْنُ رَفَّلْنَا امْرَأً سَادَ قَوْمَهُ<br>\
وَإِنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ مِنْ قَبْلِ ذٰلِكَ يُذْكَرُ<br>\

-b2-  ترفّل also signifies<br>\

chief. (Sh, T, TA.) Hence, in a trad. of Wáïl<br>\
