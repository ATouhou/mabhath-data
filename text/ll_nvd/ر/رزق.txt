رَزَقَهُ اللّٰهُ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
رَزُقَ, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. رِزْقٌ, (S,) or رَزْقٌ, (IB, K,) the latter<br>\
being the proper inf. n., (K,) and the former a<br>\
simple subst. but also used as an inf. n., (TA,)<br>\
God caused what is termed رِزْق [q. v.] to come to<br>\
him: (K:) or God gave him. (S, IB.) [The<br>\
verb is doubly trans.: when the second objective<br>\
complement is implied, the phrase generally means<br>\
God caused the means of subsistence to come to<br>\
him; i. e., gave him, granted him, or bestowed<br>\
upon him, the means of subsistence; or supplied,<br>\
provided, or blessed, him therewith: when the<br>\
second objective complement is expressed, this<br>\
word is generally one signifying the means of<br>\
subsistence or the like, property, or offspring.]<br>\
One says also, رَزَقَ الطَّائِرُ فَرْخَهُ, aor.<br>\
رَزُقَ, inf. n.<br>\
رَزْقٌ, [The bird fed its young one.] (TA.) And<br>\
رَزَقَ الأَمِيرُ الجُنْدَ The commander gave their subsistence-money, pay, or allowances, to the army:<br>\
and رَزَقَ الجُنْدَ رَزْقَةً He gave the army their subsistence-money, &amp;c., once: and رُزِقُوا رَزْقَتَيْنِ They<br>\
were given their subsistence-money, &amp;c., twice.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence رُزِقَ also signifies It (a place)<br>\
was rained upon.] Lebeed says,<br>\
رُزِقَتْ مَرَابِيعَ النُّجُومِ وَصَابَهَا<br>\
وَدْقُ الرَّوَاعِدِ جَوْدُهَا وَرِهَامُهَا<br>\
meaning مُطِرَتْ; (TA;) i. e. They were rained<br>\
upon with the rain of the أَنْوَآء [pl. of نَوْءٌ q. v.]<br>\
of the رَبِيع, and the rain of the thundering clouds<br>\
fell upon them, the copious thereof and the drizzling and lasting thereof. (EM pp. 140 and 141.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And رَزَقَ فُلَانًا He thanked such a one; was<br>\
thankful, or grateful, to him; or acknowledged his beneficence: of the dial. of Azd, (K,)<br>\
i. e. Azd-Shanooah. (TA.) One says, فَعَلْتُ<br>\
ذٰلِكَ لَمَّا رَزَقْتَنِى i. e. لَمَّا شَكَرْتَنِى [I did that since,<br>\
or because, thou thankedst me]. (TA.) And hence,<br>\
in the Kur [lvi. 81], وَتَجْعَلُونَ رِزْقَكُمْ أَنَّكُمْ تَكَذِّبُونَ<br>\
[And do ye make your thanking to be that ye<br>\
disacknowledge the benefit received, as being from<br>\
God?]; (K;) i. e., accord. to Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, do ye,<br>\
instead of acknowledging what God has bestowed<br>\
upon you, and being thankful for it, attribute it<br>\
to another than Him? or, accord. to Az and<br>\
others, [as J also says in the S,] the meaning is,<br>\
تَجْعَلُونَ شَكْرَ رِزِقْكُمُ التَّكْذِيبَ [do ye make the<br>\
thanking for your sustenance to be disacknowledgment?]: (TA:) and some read شَكْرَكُمْ [for<br>\
رِزْقَكُمْ]. (Bd.)<br>\
8<br>\
ارتزقوا, (S, Msb, K,) said of soldiers, (S,) or<br>\
of people, (Msb,) They took, or received, their<br>\
أَرْزَاق [i. e., when said of soldiers, portions of subsistence-money, pay, or allowances, and when said<br>\
of others, means of subsistence, &amp;c.]. (S, Msb,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also what next follows.<br>\
10<br>\
استرزقهُ He asked, or demanded, of him<br>\
what is termed رِزْق [i. e. means of subsistence, &amp;c.;<br>\
when said of a soldier, subsistence-money, pay, or<br>\
allowance]; (MA, TA;) as also ↓ ارتزقهُ. (TA.)<br>\
رِزْقٌ A thing whereby one profits, or from<br>\
which one derives advantage; (S, K;) as also<br>\
↓ مُرْتَزَقٌ, (K, TA,) in the pass. form: (TA: [in<br>\
the CK, erroneously, مُرْتَزِق:]) and a gift; and<br>\
especially, of God: (S:) or [especially, and according to general usage,] the means of subsistence, or of the support and growth of the body,<br>\
which God sends to [mankind and other] animals;<br>\
[sustenance, victuals, food, or provisions; or a<br>\
supply thereof from God:] but with the Moatezileh it means a thing possessed and eaten by the<br>\
deserving; so that it does not apply to what is<br>\
unlawful: (TA:) pl. أَرْزَاقٌ: (S, Msb, K:) and<br>\
what are thus termed are of two kinds; apparent,<br>\
[or material,] which are for the bodies, such as<br>\
aliments; and unapparent, [or intellectual,] which<br>\
are for the hearts and minds, such as the several<br>\
sorts of knowledge and of science: (TA:) or رِزْقٌ<br>\
properly signifies a portion, share, or lot; or<br>\
particularly, of something good, or excellent; syn.<br>\
حَظٌّ: and is conventionally made to apply to a<br>\
thing by which an animal is enabled to profit:<br>\
(Bd in ii. 2:) and [hence] it signifies also a daily<br>\
allowance of food or the like; and so ↓ رِزْقَةٌ of<br>\
which the pl. is رِزَقٌ: (TA:) [the subsistencemoney, pay, or allowance, of a soldier; or] what<br>\
is given forth to the soldier at the commencement<br>\
of every month, or day by day: or, accord. to ElKarkhee, العَطَآءُ is what is assigned to those who<br>\
fight; and الرَّزْقُ, to the poor: (Mgh: [but see<br>\
عَطَآءٌ:]) and ↓ رَزَقَاتٌ, pl. of ↓ رَزَقَةٌ, which is the<br>\
inf. n. of unity of رَرَقَ, signifies the portions of<br>\
subsistence-money, pay, or allowances, (syn. أَطْمَاع,)<br>\
of soldiers: (S, K:) one says, كَمْ رِزْقُكَ فِى الشَّهْرِ<br>\
How much is thy allowance of food, or the like,<br>\
[or thy subsistence-money, or pay,] in the month?<br>\
(TA:) and أَخَذُوا أَرْزَاقَهُمْ [They took, or received,<br>\
their portions of subsistence-money, &amp;c.,] (S,<br>\
Msb, K) is said of soldiers. (S.) الرِّزْقُ الحَسَنُ<br>\
means A thing [or provision] that comes to one<br>\
without toil in the seeking thereof: or, as some<br>\
say, a thing [or provision] that is found without<br>\
one&#39;s looking, or watching, for it, and without<br>\
one&#39;s reckoning upon it, and without one&#39;s earning it, or labouring to earn it. (KT.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Rain (S, K) is sometimes thus called; as in the<br>\
Kur xlv. 4 and li. 22: this being an amplification<br>\
in language; as when one says, “The dates are<br>\
in the bottom of the well; ” meaning thereby<br>\
“ the [water for] watering the palm-trees. ” (S.)<br>\
رَزْقَةٌ, and its pl. رَزَقَاتٌ: see the next preceding<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
رِزْقَةٌ: see رِزْقٌ.<br>\
الرَّزَّاقُ: see what next follows, in two places.<br>\
الرَّازِقُ and ↓ الرَّزَّاقُ, the latter of which has an<br>\
intensive signification, are epithets applied to God,<br>\
meaning [The Supplier of the means of subsistence, &amp;c.; or] the Creator of what are termed<br>\
الأَرْزَاق, and the Giver of their أَرْزَاق to his creatures. (TA.) [The former epithet is also applicable to a man; but ↓ the latter is not.] ―<br>\
-b2-  رَوَازِقُ<br>\
[as pl. of رَازِقٌ, agreeably with a general rule<br>\
relating to epithets of the measure فَاعِلٌ when not<br>\
applicable to rational beings, and of رَازِقَةٌ,] Dogs,<br>\

رَازِقِىٌّ [erroneously written by Golius and Freytag رَازَقِىٌّ] Weak: (Moheet, L, K:) applied to<br>\
anything. (Moheet, L.)<br>\

grapes called مُلَاحِىّ or مُلَّاحِىّ; (T, K;) a<br>\
species of grapes of Et-Táïf, with long berries;<br>\
they are called عِنَبٌ رَازِقِىٌّ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Wine<br>\
(K, TA) made of the grapes so called; (TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ رَازِقِيَّةٌ. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And ↓ رَازِقِيَّةٌ [as a<br>\
coll. gen. n. of which رَازِقِىٌّ is the n. un.] White<br>\
flaxen cloths. (S, K.) Lebeed says, describing<br>\
vessels of wine,<br>\
لَهَا غَلَلٌ مِنْ رَازِقِىٍّ وَكُرْسُفٍ<br>\
بِأَيْمَانِ عُجْمٍ يَنْصُفُونَ المَقَاوِلَا<br>\
[They have a strainer of white flaxen cloth and<br>\
of cotton, in the right hands of foreigners that<br>\
act as servants to the kings]: he means يَخْدُمُونَ<br>\
الأَقْيَالَ: (S:) and by غَلَلٌ he means “ a strainer ”<br>\
(مِصْفَاة, or فِدَام,) on the heads of the أَبَارِيك. (S<br>\
in art. غل.)<br>\
رَازِقِيَّةٌ [erroneously written by Golius and Freytag رَازَقِيَّةٌ]: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\

poetry. (IAar.)<br>\

register [of the army &amp;c.]. (Mgh.)<br>\
