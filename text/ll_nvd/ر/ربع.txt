رَبَعَ (S, Sgh, Msb) and<br>\
رَبُعَ and<br>\

رَبَعَ only,] inf. n. as above, and رباعة<br>\
[most probably رباعَةٌ] also, (L,) He took the<br>\
fourth part of their spoil: (S, Sgh, Msb, K:)<br>\
i. e., of the spoil of an army: this was done in the<br>\
Time of Ignorance, but El-Islám reduced it to<br>\
a fifth part; (K;) as is declared in the Kur viii.<br>\
42. (TA.) It is said in a trad., أَلَمْ أَجْعَلْكَ تَرْبَعُ<br>\
وَتَدْسَعُ, (S, * TA,) mentioned [and explained] in<br>\
art. دسع, q. v.: the meaning [intended] is, Did<br>\
I not make thee an obeyed chief? (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
رَبَعَهُمْ, (S, Sgh, Msb,) or رَبَعَ الثَّلَاثَةَ, (K,) aor.<br>\
رَبَعَ<br>\
(S, Sgh, Msb, K) and<br>\
رَبُعَ and<br>\
رَبِعَ, (Sgh, Msb, K,)<br>\

will be found later in the present paragraph.]<br>\
Hence, أَرْبَعَ المَرِيضَ: see 4. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَبَعَتْ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
الحُمَّى, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
رَبَعَ, inf. n. رَبْعٌ; (Msb;)<br>\
and عَلَيْهِ ↓ أَرْبَعَتْ, (S, Msb, K,) and ↓ أَرْبَعَتْهُ, but<br>\
not رَبَعَتْهُ; (IAar;) or the phrase used by the<br>\
Arabs is عليه الحمّى ↓ أَرْبَعَتْ: (Az, TA:) The<br>\
fever seized him on one day and left him two<br>\
days and then came again on the fourth day<br>\
[counting the day of the next preceding fit as the<br>\
first], (S, Msb, K,) and so on. (Msb.) And<br>\
رُبِعَ, and ↓ أْرْبِعَ, (S, K,) and ↓ أَرْبَعَ is said to be<br>\
also used in the same sense, (TA,) He had, or<br>\

-b3-  رَبَعَ said of<br>\

all in art. ثلث.)<br>\
-A3-  رُبِعَ, said of a man, also<br>\
signifies He was hit, or hurt, in the أَرْبَاع, meaning regions, of his head. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  رَبَعَ المَطَرُ الأَرْضَ<br>\
[The rain watered the earth and made it to produce herbage: see رَبِيعٌ]. (TA.) And رُبِعَتِ الأَرْضُ<br>\
The land was watered by the rain in the season<br>\
called رَبِيع. (S.) And رُبِعُوا They were rained<br>\
upon by the rain of the season called رَبِيع; (K, *<br>\
TA;) similar to قِيظُوا and صِيفُوا: (TA in art.<br>\
قيظ:) and in like manner, رُبِعَتِ الإِبِلُ The camels<br>\
were rained upon by that rain: and مَرْبَعٌ may<br>\
be an inf. n. thereof. (Ham p. 425.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
i. e. from رَبَعَ المَطَرُالأَرْضَ, the phrase, رَبَعَ الفَرَسُ<br>\
عَلَى قَوَائِمِهِ (assumed tropical:)  The horse sweated in his legs. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence also,] رَبَعَهُ اللّٰهُ (tropical:)  God restored him<br>\
from a state of poverty to wealth or competence<br>\
or sufficiency; recovered him from his embarassment or difficulty, or from a state of perdition or<br>\
destruction. (TA.)<br>\
-A5-  رَبَعَ الرَّبِيعُ, aor.<br>\
رَبَعَ, inf. n.<br>\

رَبَعَ, inf. n. رَبْعٌ, (TA,)<br>\
in its primary acceptation, signifies He remained,<br>\
abode, or dwelt, in the place in the [season called]<br>\
رَبِيع; (TA;) as also بِهِ ↓ ارتبع. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
hence, (TA,) (tropical:)  He remained, abode, or dwell, in<br>\
the place, (K, TA,) in any circumstances, and at<br>\
any time; (TA;) he took it as his home. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Also He alighted and abode wherever he<br>\
would, in the place, in abundance of herbage, and<br>\
pasturage. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\

رَبَعَ,<br>\
inf. n. رَبْعٌ, (TA,) The camels fed by themselves in the pasturage, and ate as they pleased,<br>\
and drank. (K.) [Another meaning of this<br>\
phrase has been mentioned before.] ―<br>\
-b6-  رَبَعَ فِى المَآءَ<br>\
He (a man, TA) acted according to his own<br>\
opinion or judgment, or did what he judged fit,<br>\
with respect to the water. (K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  رَبَعَ, (K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
رَبَعَ, inf. n. رَبْعٌ, (TA,) said of a man, also signifies He had, or obtained, abundance of herbage<br>\
(K, TA) [arising] from the [season, or rain,<br>\
called] رَبِيع. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Also, [app. from رَبَعَ<br>\
بِالمَكَانِ in the second of the senses explained<br>\
above, and if so, tropical, or doubly tropical,]<br>\
aor. َ0, (assumed tropical:)  He (a man, ISk, S) paused, (ISk, S, K,)<br>\
and acted, or behaved, with deliberation or in a<br>\
leisurely manner, (K,) and withheld himself.<br>\
(ISk, S, K.) And [hence,] رَبَعَ عَلَيْهِ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
رَبْعٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He was affectionate, or pitiful, or<br>\
compassionate, towards him: (K:) or he acted<br>\
gently towards him. (TA.) And رَبَعَ عَنْهُ (K,)<br>\
inf. n. رَبْعٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He restrained himself, refrained, abstained, or desisted, from it. (K.)<br>\
The phrases اِرْبَعْ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ and اربع على ظَلْعِكَ<br>\
(S, K) and اربع عَلَيْكَ (K) are from رَبَعَ in the<br>\
sense of “ he paused,” &amp;c., (S, K,) as explained<br>\
by ISk, (S,) [or in one of the senses following<br>\
that,] meaning (assumed tropical:)  Deal thou gently with thyself;<br>\
moderate thyself; restrain thyself: (S, TA:) or<br>\
behave thou with deliberation, or in a leisurely<br>\
manner: or the second of these phrases may<br>\
mean continue thou notwithstanding thy slight<br>\
lameness: or it may be from رَبَعَ الحَجَرَ, [q. v.<br>\
infrà,] meaning take thou it, or reach it, notwithstanding thy slight lameness. (TA.) The<br>\
phrase اِرْبَعِى بِنَفْسِكِ, or عَلَى نَفْسِكِ, in the trad.<br>\
of Subey&#39;ah El-Aslameeyeh, accord. to two<br>\
different relations, admits of two interpretations:<br>\
one is, (assumed tropical:)  Pause thou, and wait for the completion<br>\
of the عِدَّة [q. v.] of decease; and this is accord. to<br>\
the persuasion of those who say that her عدّة is<br>\
the more remote of the two periods, which is the<br>\
persuasion of &#39;Alee and I&#39;Ab: the second is, from<br>\
رَبَعَ الرّجُلُ signifying “ the man had, or obtained,<br>\
abundance of herbage,” and the meaning is,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  relieve thou thyself, and release thyself from the<br>\
straitness of the عدّة, and the evil of thy condition;<br>\
and this is accord. to the persuasion of those who<br>\
hold that her عدّة is the nearer of the two periods;<br>\
and hence &#39;Omar said, “If she bring forth when<br>\
her husband is on his bier, meaning, not buried,<br>\
it is allowable for her to marry. ” (TA.) It is<br>\
also said, in another trad., لَا يَرْبَعُ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ مَنْ<br>\
لَا يُحْزِنُهُ أَمْرُكَ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He will not restrain himself,<br>\
and be patient with thee, whom thy case does<br>\
not grieve. (TA.) And it is said in a prov.,<br>\
حَدِّثِ امْرَأَةً حَدِيثَيْنِ فَإِنْ أَبَتْ فَارْبَعْ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Speak<br>\
thou to a woman twice; and if she refuse, abstain<br>\
thou: or, accord. to one relation, it is ↓ فَأَرْبِعْ: and<br>\
accord. to another, فَارْبَعْهُ, i. e., then add; for she<br>\
is very weak in understanding; if she understand<br>\
not, then make thou the two speeches to be four:<br>\
Aboo-Sa&#39;eed says, فَإِنْ لَمْ تَفْهَمْ بَعْدَ الأَرْبَعَةِ فَالْمِرْبَعَة,<br>\
i. e., [and if she understand not after the four,<br>\
then] the stick [is to be used; or, then use thou<br>\
the stick]: the prov. applies to the hearing and<br>\
answering in an evil manner. (TA.) You say<br>\
also, رَبَعَتْ عَلَى عَقْلِ فُلَانٍ وَكَسَرَ فِيهَا رِبَاعَهُ, inf. n.<br>\
رِبَاعَةٌ, (tropical:)  [app. She behaved in a gentle and coaxing<br>\

understanding, of such a one, and he sold his<br>\
houses one after another to expend upon her;]<br>\

so that he sold his dwellings. (TA. [The و before<br>\

been dropped by inadvertence, I have supplied<br>\
it.])<br>\

only say, in speaking of them, شَهْرُ رَبِيعٍ الأَوَّلُ and<br>\
شَهْرُ رَبِيعٍ الآخِرٌ; (S, Msb, K;) [but in the margin<br>\
of the copy of the S which I have here followed,<br>\
I find it stated that in the handwriting of the<br>\
author the former is شهر ربيعِ الاول (with a single<br>\
kesreh, and with no syll. sign to الاول); and in<br>\
another copy of the S I find شهرُ ربيع الاولِ and<br>\
شَهرُ رَبيع الآخِر;] with the addition of شهر: but<br>\
it is allowable to say also شَهْرُ رَبِيعِ الأَوَّلِ and<br>\
شَهْرُ رَبِيعِ الآخِرِ: the word شهر is necessarily added<br>\
in order to discriminate between the months thus<br>\
called and the season called ربيع: Az says, the<br>\
Arabs mention all the months without the word<br>\
شهر except the two months of ربيع and the<br>\
month of رَمَضَان: and they say also شَهْرَا رَبِيعٍ<br>\
and أَشْهُرُ رَبِيعٍ and شُهُورُ رَبِيعٍ: (Msb:) these<br>\
months were thus called because, when they received this name, they occurred in the season<br>\
when the earth produced herbage. (Msb in art.<br>\
جمد.) It has a twofold application also to<br>\
seasons; الرَّبِيعُ الأَوَّلُ being The season in which<br>\
the truffles and the blossoms come, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
and this is [also called] رَبِيعُ الكَلَأِ [the rabeea of<br>\
the herbage, properly called the spring of Arabia];<br>\
(S;) and الرَّبِيعُ الثَّانِى The season in which fruits<br>\
ripen; (S, Msb, K;) [also called رَبِيعُ الثِّمَارِ;]<br>\
but some people call this الرَّبِيعُ الأَوَّلُ; (S, TA;)<br>\
and the season which follows the winter, and in<br>\
which the truffles and the blossoms come, they<br>\
call الرَّبِيعُ الثَّانِى; but all of them agree that the<br>\
خَرِيف [or autumn] is called الرَّبِيعُ: AHn says,<br>\
the two divisions of the winter [by which he<br>\
means the half-year commencing at the autumnal<br>\
equinox] are called رَبِيعَانِ; the former being<br>\
رَبِيعُ المَآءِ وَالأَمْطَار ِ [the rabeea of the water and<br>\
the rains, in which the rain called الوَسْمِىّ, which<br>\
is termed the first of the rains, commences]; and<br>\
the second being رَبِيعُ النَّبَاتِ [or رَبِيعُ الكَلَأِ the<br>\
rabeea of the herbage], because the herbage<br>\
therein attains to its last stage: and he adds, that<br>\
رَبِيعٌ is applied by the Arabs to the whole winter,<br>\
[meaning, again, the half-year commencing at<br>\
the autumnal equinox,] because of the moisture,<br>\
or rain: (TA:) or the year consists of six<br>\
seasons; (so in the K; but in the S, “and I<br>\
heard Abu-l-Ghowth say, the Arabs make the<br>\
year to be six seasons; ”) two months thereof are<br>\
called الرَّبِيعُ الأَوَّلُ; and two months, صَيْفٌ; and<br>\
two months, قَيْظٌ; (S, K;) and two months, ربيع<br>\
الثانى, (so in a copy of the S,) or رَبِيعٌ الثّانى, (so<br>\
in another copy of the S, [but in the margin of<br>\
this latter, I find it stated that in the handwriting of the author it is ربيعُ الثانى, without<br>\
tenween,]) or الرَّبِيعُ الثَّانِى; (K;) and two months,<br>\
خَرِيفٌ; and two months, شِتَآءٌ. (S, K.) Az relates, with respect to the seasons and divisions of<br>\
the year, on the authority of Aboo-Yahyà Ibn-Kibáseh, who possessed very great knowledge<br>\
thereof, that the year consists of four seasons;<br>\
namely, الرَّبِيعُ الأَوَّلُ, which the vulgar call الخَرِيفُ<br>\
[The autumn]; then الشِّتَآءُ [the winter]; then<br>\
الصَّيْفُ, which is الرَّبِيعُ الآخِرُ [or الثَّانِى, i. e. the<br>\
spring]; then القَيْظُ [the summer, or hot season]:<br>\
all this is what the Arabs in the desert say:<br>\
the ربيع which is with the Persians the خريف,<br>\
he says, commences on the third of أَيْلُول<br>\
[September O. S.]; and the شِتَآء, on the third<br>\
of كَانُون الأَوَّل [December O. S.]; and the صيف<br>\
which is with the Persians the ربيع. on the fifth<br>\
of آذَار [March O. S.]; and the قيظ which is<br>\
with the Persians the صيف, on the fourth of<br>\
حَزِيرَان [June O. S.]: and Aboo-Yahyà adds, the<br>\
ربيع of the people of El-&#39; Irák agrees with the<br>\
ربيع of the Persians, which is after the شتاء [or<br>\
winter], and which is the season of the flowers,<br>\
or roses, and is the most temperate of the seasons:<br>\
the people of El-&#39; Irák, he says, have rain in all<br>\
the winter, and have abundance of herbage in<br>\
the خريف, which the Arabs call الربيع الاوّل: and<br>\
Az says, the quarter of the خريف is called خريف<br>\
because the fruits are gathered therein; and the<br>\
Arabs call it ربيع because the first rain [which is<br>\
called الوَسْمِىّ] falls therein. (TA.) The pl. of<br>\
ربيع is أَرْبِعَةٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and أَرْبِعَآءُ [a pl. of<br>\
mult.] (S, Msb, K) and رِبَاعٌ; (AHn, K;) or the<br>\
first of these is pl. of ربيع الكلأ (Fr, Yaakoob, S,<br>\
Msb, K) and of the ربيع of the months; (Fr,<br>\
Msb;) but the second is pl. of ربيع in the sense of<br>\
جَدْوَلٌ, to be explained below. (Fr, Yaakoob, S,<br>\
Msb, K.) Hence the phrase in a supplication,<br>\
mentioned in a trad., اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلِ القُرْآنَ رَبِيعَ قَلْبِى<br>\
[O God, make Thou the Kur-án to be the life,<br>\
or ease, of my heart]; because the heart of man<br>\
becomes lively, or at ease, in the season called<br>\
رَبِيع. (TA.) Hence also, (TA,) أَبُو الرَّبِيعِ The<br>\
هُدْهُد [or hoopoe]; (K;) because it appears with<br>\
the [season called] ربيع. (TA.) [See also, respecting the seasons &amp;c., the word زَمَنٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\

rain which is after the وَسْمِىّ, and after which is<br>\
[that called] the صَيْف, and then the حَمِيم: or,<br>\
accord. to AHn, rain whenever it comes: Az<br>\
says, I have heard the Arabs call thus the first<br>\
rain falling upon the earth in the days of the<br>\
خَرِيف [or autumn]: (TA:) the pl. [of pauc.] is<br>\

growth during the winter-quarter, which is also<br>\
called the رَبِيع, and which includes, as stated<br>\
above, what is really the spring of Arabia, called<br>\
“ the rabeea of the herbage,” wherein, as AHn<br>\
says, the herbage attains to its last stage: it seems<br>\
generally to mean the spring-herbage, which is<br>\
earlier or later in different latitudes:] pl. أَرِْبعَةٌ.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence,] a poet says,<br>\

(S in art. صعفق,) [The jerboa;] a certain wellknown beast; (K;) a small beast like the فَأْرَة [or<br>\
rat], but longer in the tail and ears, and of which<br>\
the hind legs are longer than the fore-legs, the<br>\
reverse of what is the case in the زَرَافَة [or giraffe];<br>\
called by the vulgar جَرْبُوع; (Msb;) a rat (فَأْرَة)<br>\
of which the burrow has four entrances; Az says,<br>\
it is a small beast larger than the جُرَذ, [q. v.; but<br>\
in the L, in art. جرذ, the reverse of this is said;]<br>\
and the name is applied alike to the male and the<br>\
female: (TA:) [Forskål (“ Descr. Animalium,”<br>\
p. iv.,) terms it mus jaculus: see the questions<br>\
appended to Niebuhr&#39;s “ Descr. de l&#39; Arabie,” p.<br>\
177:] pl. يَرَابِيعُ. (S, Msb.) [See ذُو الرُّمَيْحِ, voce<br>\
رُمْحٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) اليَرْبُوعُ also signifies<br>\
لَحْمَةُ المَتْنِ (tropical:)  [The portion of flesh and sinew next<br>\
the back-bone, on either side]; (S * K;) as being<br>\
likened to the فأَرة [thus called]: (TA:) or this is<br>\
with damm [اليُرْبُوعُ]: (K:) or the يَرَابِيعُ of the<br>\
مَتْن are its portions of flesh; (T, S, K;) and the<br>\
word has no sing.: (K:) Az says, I have not<br>\
heard any sing. thereof. (TA.)<br>\
الجَارُ اليَرْبُوعِىُّ The neighbour that is variable in<br>\
his actions [like the jerboa, which is noted for<br>\
having recourse to various expedients, in the<br>\
formation of its burrow, &amp;c., to avoid capture];<br>\
like الجَارُ البَرَاقِشِىُّ. (IAar, TA in art. جور.)<br>\
