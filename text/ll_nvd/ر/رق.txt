-b2-  See also رَقَاقٌ.<br>\
رِقَّةٌ [an inf. n. of رَقَّ in several senses, as shown<br>\
above, in the first paragraph of this art.]: it is<br>\
explained in the K as syn. with دِقَّةٌ: [see 1, first<br>\
sentence:] but El-Munáwee says, in the “ Tow-<br>\

with regard to the lateral parts of a thing, and<br>\
the former with regard to the depth of a thing [or<br>\
the extent between the two opposite surfaces<br>\
