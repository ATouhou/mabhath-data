رَخُمَ; (K;) It (the voice,<br>\
S, TA, and speech, K, TA) was, or became, soft,<br>\
or gentle, and easy: (S, * K, TA:) [or it (the<br>\
voice) was, or became, soft, or gentle, plaintive,<br>\
and melodious: (see رَخِيمٌ:)] it (a thing, and the<br>\

in speech is a good quality in women. (TA.)<br>\
One says also of a girl, رَخُمَتْ, (K, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
as above, (TA,) meaning She was, or became,<br>\
easy [and soft or gentle] in speech: (K, TA:)<br>\
and in like manner, of a [young gazelle such as is<br>\
termed] خِشْف [meaning in voice, or cry]: and<br>\
رَخَمَتْ, said of a she-gazelle, means she uttered a<br>\
[soft or gentle] cry. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  رَخَمَتْ بَيْضَهَا and<br>\
عَلَى بَيْضِهَا: see 4. ―<br>\

وَلَدَهَا, aor.<br>\
رَخُمَ and<br>\
رَخَمَ, (assumed tropical:)  She (a woman) played<br>\
with her child: (K:) [or,] accord. to the “ Nawá-<br>\
dir el-Aaráb,” ترخم صَبِيَّهَا and ترخم عَلَيْهِ, [app.<br>\
تَرْخُمُ and تَرْخَمُ in both cases,] said of a woman,<br>\
mean تَرْحَمُهُ (tropical:)  [She treats, or regards, her boy<br>\
with mercy, pity, or compassion; &amp;c.]: (TA:)<br>\
and رَخَمْتُ الشَّىْءَ means رَحِمْتُهُ (tropical:)  [I treated, or<br>\
regarded, the thing with mercy, &amp;c.]: (K, TA:)<br>\
AZ says that رَخِمَهُ, aor.<br>\
رَخَمَ, inf. n. رَخَمَةٌ, and<br>\
رَحِمَهُ, aor.<br>\
رَخَمَ, inf. n. رَحْمَةٌ, are syn.: (S:) and he<br>\
says that رَخَمَ [thus accord. to the TA] is of the<br>\
dial. of some of the people of El-Yemen: it is<br>\
tropical: Lh, also, mentions رَخَمَهُ, aor.<br>\
رَخَمَ, inf. n.<br>\
رخَمَةٌ, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, inclined<br>\
to favour him, or affectionate to him. (TA.)<br>\

signifying, as some say, The cutting off [a thing],<br>\
or cutting [it] at its extremity, or curtailing [it],<br>\
(S,) the تَرْخِيم of the name, (S, Msb, K,) in the<br>\
vocative form of speech; (S;) [accord. to general<br>\
opinion,] because it facilitates the pronunciation<br>\
thereof; (K;) i. e. the [abbreviating by the]<br>\
eliding of the end thereof, for the alleviation of<br>\
the utterance; (Msb;) the curtailing a name of<br>\
its last letter, or more; (S, TA;) as when, to one<br>\
whose name is حَارِثٌ or مَالِكٌ, you say يَا حَارِ or<br>\
يَامَالِ: but accord. to Z, in the A, it is from the<br>\
ترخيم of the hen; because this is only on the<br>\
occasion of the cutting short (قَطْع) [of the laying]<br>\
of the eggs: (TA:) [in like manner also] the<br>\
تَرْخِيم of the diminutive is the [abbreviating<br>\
thereof by the] cutting off of [one or more of]<br>\
the augmentative letters [and sometimes of radical letters]; as when, in forming the diminutive<br>\
of أَسْوَدُ [and that of إِبْرَاهِيمُ], one says سُوَيْدٌ [and<br>\
بُرَيْهُ]. (Har p. 334.) ―<br>\
-b3-  رخّم الدَّجَاجَةَ, inf. n. as<br>\

alone; (JK;) and بَيْضَهَا ↓ رَخَمَتْ, and عَلَى بَيْضِهَا,<br>\
(K,) aor.<br>\
رَخُمَ, (TA,) inf. n. رَخْمٌ and رَخَمٌ and<br>\
رَخَمَةٌ; (K;) She (a domestic hen, JK, S, K, and<br>\

common, and which is mentioned above as an<br>\
inf. n]: (S, K,* TA:) the latter is nearly the<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  His love, and his gentleness, fell, or lighted,<br>\
upon him. (S.) And ↓ أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ رَخَمَتَهُ and<br>\

upon him, or bestowed upon him,] his love, and<br>\

to fall, or light, upon him, or bestowed upon him,]<br>\
her favour, or affection, or her mercy, pity, or<br>\
compassion. (TA.) And أُمِّهِ ↓ أُلْقِيَتْ عَلَيْهِ رَخَمَةُ,<br>\
i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [upon whom] the love and familiarity of his<br>\
mother [have been made to fall or light, or have<br>\
been bestowed], is an explanation given by As of<br>\
the pass. part. n. ↓ مَرْخُومٌ. (S, TA.) [But accord.<br>\
to Z, these significations are from رَخَمَةٌ as signifying a bird of a certain species described in what<br>\
follows: for] it is said in the A that أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ<br>\
↓ رَخَمَةً means (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, affectionate,<br>\
or pitiful, or compassionate, to him, and attached<br>\
to him: because the رَخَمَة is vehemently voracious,<br>\
and fond of alighting upon carcasses: therefore<br>\
love and affection lighting upon one are likened<br>\
thereto. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  A certain [species of] bird,<br>\
well known; [the vultur percnopterus; being for<br>\
the most part white, called by some the white<br>\
carrion-vulture of Egypt and the neighbouring<br>\
countries; and also called Pharaoh&#39;s hen; in<br>\
Hebr. 165: (see Bochart, Hieroz., 297-322:)]<br>\
n. un. ↓ رَخَمَةٌ: (K:) the former is the pl. of the<br>\
latter, (S, Msb,) denoting the genus, (S,) [i. e.,<br>\
its coll. gen. n.,] like as قَصَبٌ is of قَصَبَةٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
the pl. [properly so termed] of رَخَمَةٌ is رُخْمٌ [like<br>\
as بُدْنٌ is of بَدَنَةٌ, or perhaps of رَخَمٌ, like as<br>\
أُسْدٌ is of أَسَدٌ,] (JK, TA) and also ↓رُخَمٌ [which<br>\
is anomalous]: (JK:) the ↓ رَخَمَة is a partycoloured bird, white and black, (S, TA,) resembling the نَسْر (JK, S, TA) in form; and also<br>\
called أَنُوقٌ: (S, TA:) [it is said to be] a bird<br>\
that eats human dung, a foul bird, not of such as<br>\
are pursued as game, wherefore no expiation is<br>\
incumbent on him who kills it when he is in the<br>\
state of إِحْرَام, for it is not eaten: it is [said to be]<br>\
thus called because it is too weak to take prey:<br>\
(Msb:) [various fanciful uses of its gall-bladder<br>\
and flesh &amp;c. for medicinal and other purposes are<br>\
described in the K: accord. to some, if not all,<br>\
it is a term for the female: (see أَنُوقٌ:)] the male<br>\
is called ↓يَرْخُمٌ and ↓يَرْخُومٌ (JK, K) and ↓تَرْخُومٌ.<br>\
(Kr, K.)<br>\
-A3-  Also Thick milk. (IAar, K.)<br>\
-A4-<br>\
The ↓رَخَمَة [as written in the JK, but in the TA<br>\
without any syll. signs,] of the horse is like the<br>\
رَبْلَة [app. as meaning The inner part of the<br>\
thigh] of a human being: (JK, TA:) one says,<br>\
فَرَسٌ نَاتِىءُ الرخمةِ [A horse having the رخمة protuberant]. (TA.) [If correctly written in the<br>\
JK, it is probably a n. un. of which رَخَمٌ is the<br>\
coll. gen. n.: and hence, perhaps,] وَرْهَآءُ الرَّخَمِ,<br>\
applied by the poet &#39; Amr Dhu-l-Kelb to a ewe<br>\
abounding with milk, as meaning Soft [in the<br>\
رَخَم, and app. protuberant therein, and by reason<br>\
thereof, and of the largeness of her udder, waddling,] as though she were mad, or possessed.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رُخَمٌ a pl. of رَخَمَةٌ q. v. [n. un. of رَخَمٌ; like<br>\
رُخْمٌ, but anomalous]. (JK.)<br>\
رُخُمٌ Lumps of biestings. (IAar, K.)<br>\
رُخْمَةٌ, with damm, (TA, [analogously with the<br>\
generality of words of similar meaning, but this<br>\
fact may have occasioned some writer&#39;s adding<br>\
“ with damm,”] or ↓ رَخَمَةٌ, (so in the JK, [if<br>\
correct, app., as being likened to a white vulture,])<br>\
A whiteness in the head of a ewe or she-goat:<br>\

TA:) what is of the colour of wine, or yellow, or<br>\
dappled, is of the kinds of stones, (K, TA,) i. e.,<br>\
not [a sort] of رُخَام: (TA:) a well-known kind of<br>\

its places of growth are the sands: (AHn, TA:)<br>\
