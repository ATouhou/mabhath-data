رَكَعَ, (Th, S, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
رَكَعَ, (Th, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
رُكُوعٌ (Th, S, Mgh, Msb, K) and رَكْعٌ, (Th,<br>\
TA,) He bowed, or bent, himself; or became<br>\
bowed or bent: (Th, S, Mgh, Msb:) so says Er-Rághib, adding that it is sometimes used to<br>\
denote a particular manner of doing so in prayer,<br>\
and sometimes to denote humility and self-abasement either in worship or in other cases: (TA:)<br>\
he lowered his head: (Th:) and he (an old man)<br>\
bowed himself, or bent himself, or became bowed<br>\
or bent, by reason of age: (S, Msb, K:) this is<br>\
[said to be] the primary signification: (TA:) or<br>\
he fell upon his face; (IDrd, IB, K;) and<br>\
stumbled. (IB.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, from رَكَعَ as<br>\
used in the first of the senses explained above,<br>\
(S, Mgh,) or as used in the first of the senses<br>\
assigned to it above when said of an old man,<br>\
(TA,) or as used in the last sense explained above,<br>\

by a person praying, (TA,) [or in prayer,] after<br>\
the act of standing in which the recitation [of<br>\
portions of the Kur-án] is performed, so that the<br>\
palms of the hands reach the knees; or, so that<br>\
the back becomes depressed; (K, TA;) accord. to<br>\
the doctors of practical law, so that if a cup full of<br>\
water be placed upon the back, it will not be spilled.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  رَكَعَ إِلَى اللّٰهِ He lowered his head, or<br>\

وَارْكَعُوا مَعَ الرَّاكِعِينَ, And pray ye with those<br>\
who pray. (Mgh.) You say also, رَكَعَ رَكْعَةً,<br>\
and رَكْعَتَيْنِ, and ثَلَاثَ رَكَعَاتٍ, He prayed a<br>\
rek&#39;ah, and two rek&#39;ahs, and three rek&#39;ahs. (K.)<br>\
[See رَكْعَةٌ, below.] ―<br>\

several others, He stood to prayer. (Msb) ―<br>\

رَكْعَةٌ, [inf. n. of un. of 1: and particularly signifying] A single act of standing in prayer: and in<br>\
its legal acceptation, used in a more particular<br>\
sense; (Msb;) meaning a single act of standing<br>\
in prayer, followed by the رُكُوع [or lowering of<br>\
the head in the manner described above (see<br>\
الرُّكُوعُ فِى الصَّلَاةِ in the first paragraph)] and<br>\
two prostrations: (TA:) [and hence, by a further<br>\
extension of the meaning, for صَلَاةُ رَكْعَةٍ, the<br>\
prayer of one bowing of the head and body; the<br>\
previous act of standing, and the two subsequent<br>\
prostrations, being understood as included in this<br>\

in the last of these senses,] you say, صَلَّى رَكْعَةً<br>\
[He performed the prayer of one bowing of the<br>\
head and body]: (K:) and صَلَّى رَكْعَتَيْنِ [he<br>\
performed the prayers of two bowings of the head<br>\
and body]. (Msb, K.) [A full description of the<br>\
act of prayer thus termed may be seen in my work<br>\
on the Modern Egyptians.]<br>\
