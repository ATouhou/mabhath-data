K,) aor. as above, (T,) inf. n. رَوْبٌ, (M,) (tropical:)  [His<br>\

shed; (T;) of one who has exposed himself to<br>\
slaughter: (A:) like the phrase يَفُورُ دَمُهُ; (T;) or like<br>\
يَغْلِى دَمُهُ: his blood being likened to milk that<br>\

that he defends not at all: or, as some say, he<br>\
mixes water with the milk, and so spoils it, and<br>\
he makes it good; from the saying of IAar that<br>\
رَابَ signifies أَصْلَحَ; but if it have this meaning,<br>\
it is originally رَأَبَ, with hemz. (T. [See more<br>\
in art. شوب.])<br>\

sense, (Kr, M, A, K,) and in the other senses<br>\
which follow: (M:) this is the primary signification: (TA:) or ferment of milk which contains<br>\

شَوْبًا لَكَ رُوبَتُهُ [Mix thou a mixture, app. of thick<br>\
and fresh milk: thine shall be what will remain<br>\
of it]: (S:) or لَكَ بَعْضُهُ [thine shall be some of<br>\
it]: (so Meyd:) it is like the saying اُحْلُبْ حَلَبًا<br>\
لَكَ شَطْرُهُ [expl. in art. شطر]: (S, Meyd:) and is<br>\
applied in inciting to aid him in whom one will<br>\

art. رأب.]<br>\
رَوْبَانُ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
رَائِبٌ, applied to milk, (Lth, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K, &amp;c.,) and ↓ رَوْبٌ, so applied, (Lth, T, M, K,)<br>\

also رُوبَةٌ, in two places: or thick, (S,) or having<br>\
a compact pellicle upon its surface, and thick, or<br>\
resembling liver so that it quivers, (Lth, T,) and<br>\

(T, S Mgh) meaning Aboo-Má&#39;iz gave thee to<br>\

obtain, (T,) or [rather] but who will be answerable to thee for, (S,) the unchurned (T, S) [that<br>\
is thick, or] that has not had its butter taken<br>\
forth from it? (S. [Or رَائِب in the former<br>\
instance may be from رَابَ of which the aor. is<br>\
يَرِيبُ; so that it may there mean what occasioned<br>\
doubt, or evil opinion: see رَائِبٌ in art. ريب: and<br>\
if so, this word as belonging to the present art.,<br>\
and applied to milk, may signify only thick, or<br>\
unchurned.]) And one says, مَا عِنْدَهُ شَوْبٌ وَ لَا<br>\
↓ رَوْبٌ, (T,) or مَا عِنْدِى الخ, (M,) i. e. He has<br>\
not, or I have not, mixed honey, nor milk such as<br>\
is termed رَائِب: (T, M:) or, as some say, honey<br>\
nor milk; thus explaining the two words شوب<br>\
and روب without restriction. (M. [See also art.<br>\
شوب.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] رَائِبٌ applied to a man, (T,<br>\
S, M, A, K,) as also ↓ رَوْبَانُ, (T, M, K,) and<br>\
↓ أَرْوَبُ, (M, K,) (tropical:)  Confused, disturbed, or disordered, (T, S, A,) in mind, by reason of drowsiness, or satiety, or intoxication: (A:) or confounded, or perplexed; unable to see his right<br>\

(A:) fem. [of the first] رَائِبَةٌ: (Lh, M:) pl. of<br>\

-b3-  And رَائِبٌ<br>\
also signifies (tropical:)  A thing, or an affair, that is clear,<br>\
or free from dubiousness or confusedness; (Th, T<br>\
and TA in art. ريب;) like the milk so termed.<br>\

أَرْوَبُ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مِرْوَبٌ A vessel, (T, S,) or receptacle, (A,) or<br>\

رَائِب. (Har p. 416.)<br>\
مُرَوَّبٌ Milk that has not as yet been churned,<br>\
and that is in the skin, not having had its butter<br>\
taken from it. (As, T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And سِقَآءٌ مُرَوَّبٌ A<br>\
skin in which milk has been made such as is<br>\
termed رَائِب: (M, K:) or a skin that is wrapped<br>\
up [in order that its milk may thicken more<br>\
quickly by its being kept warm] until it attains<br>\
the fit time for the churning. (S.) It is said in a<br>\
prov., أَهْوَنُ مَظْلُومٍ سِقَآءٌ مُرَوَّبٌ, (T, S, M, A,)<br>\
meaning [The lightest in estimation] of what is<br>\
drunk, or given to be drunk, [of milk,] before its<br>\
butter comes forth from it (As, T) [is that in] a<br>\
skin that is wrapped up &amp;c., as expl. above: (S:)<br>\
[or (assumed tropical:)  the least to be esteemed of the wronged is he<br>\
who remains quiet, or inert, like milk not yet in<br>\
a state of fermentation:] AZ mentions it as<br>\
applied to him who is low, abject, or contemptible; who is held to be weak: and he says that<br>\
ظَلَمْتُ السِّقَآءَ means “ I gave [the milk of] the<br>\
skin to be drunk before it had attained to maturity<br>\
[so as to be fit for the process of churning]: ”<br>\
(T:) or مُرَوَّبٌ signifies not churned, but having<br>\
in it its ferment; and the prov. is applied to him<br>\
who is constrained to do something that is difficult, and to become in a state of abasement, or<br>\
ignominy, and does not manifest any disapproval.<br>\
