rendered water turbid, thick, or muddy; (IAar,<br>\
S, K;) as also ↓ ارنق. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And the former, He cleared it; rendered it clear: thus it<br>\
bears two contr. significations. (IAar, K.)<br>\
[Hence,] one says, رنّق اللّٰهُ قَذَاتَكَ May God<br>\
clear away thy قذاة [or mote in the eye; probably meaning (assumed tropical:)  that which annoys thee]. (IAar,<br>\
K)<br>\

come. (TA.) And The being weak, or infirm,<br>\
[and, app., disordered, or perturbed,] in sight, and<br>\
in body, and in an affair or case. (S, K.) Hence,<br>\
(TA,) رنّقوا فِى الأَمْرِ They confused the judgment,<br>\
or opinion, [that they formed, or they were confused in judgment or opinion,] in, or respecting,<br>\
the affair, or case. (S, K.) ―<br>\

have secreted milk in their udders; (JK;) but<br>\

looking at it]. (S in art. دنق.) And رنّق النَّظَرَ<br>\

or] he concealed the looking. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Said of a<br>\

flapped his wings in the air, (S, K,) and remained<br>\

in the air without alighting and without quitting<br>\
his place: or it has two meanings: i. e. he expanded his wings in the air without moving them:<br>\
and he flapped his wings. (TA.) Hence, said of<br>\
a captive, He stretched out his neck on the<br>\
occasion of slaughter, like the bird expanding his<br>\
wings. (TA.) [Hence also,] رنّقت السَّفِينَةُ (JK,<br>\

breaking of the wing of a bird by a shot or throw,<br>\
or by disease, so that he, or it, falls. (Lth, K.)<br>\

predominated in it: (JK, K, TA:) but the correct phrase, as given in the “Nawádir” by Lh,<br>\
is, صَارَ المَآءُ رَنْقَةً وَاحِدَةً [The water became one<br>\

وَجْهِ الضُّحَى. (TA.) And رَوْنَقُ الشَّبَابِ means<br>\
(tropical:)  The prime of youth; and its freshness, or brightness, and beauty. (TA.)<br>\
