(TA.) And it is said in a trad. of &#39;Áïsheh, respecting the material for dyeing the hair, and the<br>\
hands of women, اُسْلُتِيهِ وَأَرْغِمِيهِ [Wipe thou it off<br>\
from thy hand, or hands, and cast it upon the<br>\
earth, or dust]. (S. [There said to be from the<br>\
phrase here next following.]) You say also, ارغم<br>\
أَنْفَهُ He, (i. e. God, JK, S,) or it, (i. e. abasement,<br>\
or humility, or submissiveness, K, * TA, *) made<br>\
his nose to cleave to the رَغَام, i. e. earth, or dust;<br>\
(JK, * S, TA;) [or may He (i. e. God) make his<br>\
nose to cleave to the earth, or dust;] and ↓ رَغَمَ<br>\
أَنْفَهُ signifies the same [app. in this (the proper)<br>\
sense, as well as in that next following]. (Mgh,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] the former of these two<br>\

humbled him, or rendered him submissive, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) against his will; (TA;) [or may He abase<br>\

ارغمهُ alone; (K, TA;) like ادغمهُ; (TA;) or<br>\

not able to hold back, or that which he could not<br>\

-b4-<br>\

ترغّم (assumed tropical:)  He became angered, or angry, (S, K,<br>\
TA,) with speech, and otherwise: (TA:) and<br>\
sometimes it occurs with ز [i. e. تزغّم]. (S, TA.)<br>\
Hence the saying of El-Hotei-ah, [app. describing<br>\
a she-camel,]<br>\
تَرَى بَيْنَ لَحْيَيْهَا إِذَا مَا تَرَغَّمَتْ<br>\

-A2-  See also 1.<br>\
رَغْمٌ and ↓ رُغْمٌ and ↓ رِغْمٌ are inf. ns. of رَغِمَ and<br>\
رَغَمَ said of the nose; and ↓ مَرْغَمَةٌ is syn. therewith; (S;) as is also ↓ مَرْغَمٌ. (TA.) One says<br>\
to another, [by way of imprecation,] رَغْمًا [for<br>\
رَغِمَ أَنْفُكَ رَغَمًا May thy nose cleave fast to the<br>\
earth, or dust; meant to be understood in the<br>\
proper sense, or in a tropical sense explained by<br>\
what follows]; (JK, M, K;) and [sometimes]<br>\
دَغْمًا is added, (M,) which is an imitative sequent<br>\
to رَغْمًا. (K in art. دغم.) And لِأَنْفِهِ الرَّغْمُ and<br>\
↓ المَرْغَمَةُ [May cleaving to the earth, or dust,<br>\
befall his nose; which may likewise be meant to<br>\
be understood properly, or tropically]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] the first also signifies, (IAar, K, TA,)<br>\
and so ↓ مَرْغَمَةٌ also,<br>\
(TA,) (tropical:)  Abasement. (IAar, Mgh, K, TA.) The<br>\
Prophet said, ↓ بُعِثْتُ مَرْغَمَةً, (S,) i. e. (tropical:)  I was<br>\
sent for abasement to the believers in a plurality<br>\
of gods, [or] by reason of dislike or disapproval [of their state; agreeably with the explanation next following]. (TA.) ―<br>\

of him; or] notwithstanding his dislike, or disapproval, or hatred. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\

↓ مَنْهُ الرُّغْمُ, [or الرَّغْمُ, in the TA without the vowel-sign,] occurring in a trad., means (assumed tropical:)  In order that<br>\
he may become humble and abased, and the pride<br>\
