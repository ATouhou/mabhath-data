رَابَنِى, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) aor. يَرِيبُ, (M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) inf. n. رَيْبٌ (T, M, Mgh, Msb, &amp;c.) and<br>\
رِيبَةٌ, (M, K,) or the latter is a simple subst.,<br>\
(S, Msb,) It (a thing) occasioned in me disquiet,<br>\
disturbance, or agitation, of mind: (Ksh and Bd<br>\
in ii. 1:) [this is the primary signification; (see<br>\
رِيبَةٌ;) a signification also borne by ↓ أَرَابَنِى; (see<br>\
the verses of Khálid cited in this paragraph;)<br>\
whence the other significations here expl. in what<br>\
follows:] it (a thing) made me to doubt: (Msb:<br>\
and in like manner رَابَهُ is expl. in the Mgh:) or<br>\
it (a thing, M) caused me to have what is termed<br>\
رِيبَة [i. e. doubt, or suspicion or evil opinion, or<br>\
doubt combined with suspicion or evil opinion];<br>\
as also ↓ أَرَابَنِى: (M, K: in both of which this<br>\
meaning is indicated, but not expressed:) but the<br>\
latter is said by Lth to be bad: (T:) or, (T, M,<br>\
Msb,) accord. to AZ, (T, Msb,) the former signifies he, (T, M, *) or it, i. e. his case, (M, * Msb,)<br>\
made me to know that there was on his part what<br>\
is termed رِيبَة [i. e. something occasioning doubt,<br>\
or suspicion or evil opinion, or doubt combined<br>\
with suspicion or evil opinion]; (T, M, Msb;)<br>\
made me to be certain, or sure, of it: (Msb:)<br>\
and ↓ the latter signifies made me to think that<br>\
there was in him what is so termed; (Sb, T, M,<br>\
Msb, K;) without my being certain, or sure, of<br>\
it: (Msb:) [Az says that] these are the right<br>\
explanations of the two phrases: (T:) [or] the<br>\
latter signifies also جَعَلَ فِىَّ الرِّيَبَةَ [he put into<br>\
me, i. e. into my mind, doubt, or suspicion &amp;c.];<br>\
(Sb, M, K; and in a similar manner أَرَبْتُهُ is expl.<br>\
in the latter;) or أَوْهَمَنِى الرِّيبَةَ [he made me to<br>\
think that which occasioned doubt, or suspicion<br>\
&amp;c.]: (K: and in like manner ارابهُ is expl. in the<br>\
Ham p. 363:) and رِبْتُهُ signifies أَوْصَلْتُ إِلَيْهِ الرِّيبَةَ<br>\
[I made doubt, or suspicion &amp;c., or that which<br>\
occasioned doubt, or suspicion &amp;c., to come to<br>\
him, or to reach him]; (K;) [app. by some act;<br>\
for it is said that] رَابَهُ signifies أَتَاهُ بِرِيبَةٍ [he did<br>\
to him a thing that occasioned doubt, or suspicion<br>\
&amp;c.]: (Ham ubi suprà:) or, (K,) accord. to Lh,<br>\
the Arabs say, (M,) رَابَنِى أَمْرُهُ, aor. يَرِيبُنِى, inf. n.<br>\
رَيْبٌ and رِيبَةٌ: when they speak allusively [with<br>\
respect to the cause of doubt &amp;c., not expressing<br>\
it,] (إِذَا كَنَوْا [misinterpreted in the TA as meaning “ when they affix a pronoun to the verb,” for<br>\
the meaning here intended is clearly shown by<br>\
what follows,]) they prefix ا [to the verb, saying<br>\
↓ أَرَابَ, and أَرَبْتُ, &amp;c., expl. in the latter part of<br>\
this paragraph]; and when they do not speak<br>\
allusively [with respect to the cause of doubt &amp;c.,<br>\
but express it,] (إِذَا لَمْ يَكْنُوا) they reject that<br>\
letter; but [so accord. to the M, but in the K<br>\
“ or,”] it is allowable to say, الأَمْرُ ↓ أَرَابَنِى; (M,<br>\
K;) i. e., to prefix the ا when the verb is made<br>\
trans.: (M:) accord. to As, (T,) رَابَنِى [signifies<br>\
he did what made me to doubt, or to have doubt,<br>\
or suspicion &amp;c, and what I disliked, or hated;<br>\
for it] is said of a man when thou seest, on his<br>\
part, what makes thee to doubt, &amp;c., (مَا يُرِيبُكَ,<br>\
[or مَا يَرِيبُكَ,]) and what thou dislikest, or hatest:<br>\
(T, S:) and Hudheyl say, ↓ أَرَابَنِى, (T, S, Msb,)<br>\
or ارابنى أَمْرُهُ, as As says on the authority of &#39;Eesà<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Omar; (M;) and رِبْتُ and ↓ اِرْتَبْتُ, meaning I doubted: (Msb:) accord. to IAth, رَابَنِى<br>\
الشَّكُّ [an evident mistranscription for رابنى الشَّىْءُ]<br>\
and ↓ ارابنى both mean شَكَّكَنِى وَ أَوْهَمَنِى الرِّيبَةَ بِهِ<br>\
[i. e. the thing made me to doubt, and caused me<br>\
to think that there was that which occasioned<br>\
doubt, or suspicion &amp;c., in it]; but when you are<br>\
certain, or sure, of it, you say [only] رَابَنِى, without [an incipient] ا: (TA:) accord. to Lth, رَابَنِى<br>\
الأَمْرُ, inf. n. رَيْبٌ, signifies the thing, or event,<br>\
[app. said only of that which is evil,] betided me,<br>\
or befell me: and رَابَنِى أَمْرُهُ, his affair, or case,<br>\
brought upon me doubt (شَكًّا [in the TA شَرًّا i. e.<br>\
evil]) and fear. (T.) It is said in a trad., of<br>\
Fátimeh, يَرِيبُنِى مَا يَرِيبُهَا, meaning That displeases and disquiets me which displeases and disquiets her. (TA.) And in another, respecting a<br>\
gazelle lying curled in sleep, لَا يَرِيبُهُ أَحَدٌ بِشَىْءٍ,<br>\
meaning No one shall oppose himself to it and<br>\
disquiet it, or disturb it. (TA.) And in another,<br>\
مَا رَابَكَ إِلَى قَطْعِهَا, i. e. What disquieted thee and<br>\
constrained thee to cut it off? as Aboo-Moosà<br>\
thinks the phrase may be read: but see another<br>\
reading voce رَابٌ. (TA.) And in another, دَعْ مَا<br>\
وَ إِنَّ ↓ يَرِيبُكَ إِلَى مَا لَا يَريبُكَ فَإِنَّ الكَذِبَ رِيبَةٌ<br>\
الصِّدْقَ طُمَأْنِينَةٌ, (Mgh, TA, *) or, as some relate<br>\
it, ↓ يُرِيبُكَ, (TA,) i. e. Leave thou that which<br>\
causeth thee to doubt, (Mgh, TA, *) and occasioneth in thee الرِّيبَة, which originally signifies<br>\
disquiet, or disturbance, or agitation, of mind,<br>\
[and hence suspicion &amp;c., and betake thyself to<br>\
that which will not cause thee to doubt, &amp;c., for<br>\
verily lying is a thing that occasions disquiet of<br>\
mind, or doubt, or suspicion &amp;c., and verily<br>\
veracity is a thing that occasions tranquillity;]<br>\
because the mind is not at rest when it doubts,<br>\
but becomes tranquil when it is certain, or sure.<br>\
(Mgh.) And the Hudhalee, (S, TA,) Khálid Ibn-Zuheyr, (TA,) says,<br>\
يَا قَوْمِ مَا لِى وَ أَبَا ذُؤَيْبِ<br>\
كُنْتُ إِذَا أَتَوْتُهُ مِنْ غَيْبِ<br>\
يَشُمُّ عِطْفِى وَ يَجُرُّ ثَوْبِى<br>\
بِرَيْبِ ↓ كَأَنَّنِى أَرَبْتُهُ<br>\
[O my people, what aileth me with Aboo-Dhueyb? I was (such that) when I came to him<br>\
after absence, or from being absent, he would<br>\
smell my side, or my armpit, and pull my garment, as though I disquieted his mind with doubt,<br>\
or suspicion &amp;c.]: (S and TA, in this art. and in<br>\
art. بز; but in the latter with يَبُزُّ in the place of<br>\
its syn. يَجُرُّ:) it is said in the L that اراب is<br>\
trans. and intrans.; and that he who makes it<br>\
trans. makes it syn. with رَابَ; and thus it is in<br>\
the saying of Khálid cited above; the last hemistich of which is also related thus:<br>\
كَأَنَّنِى قَدْ رِبْتُهُ بِرَيْبِ<br>\
but ↓ اراب when intrans. signifies أَتَى بِرِيبَةٍ<br>\
[meaning he did an act that occasioned doubt, or<br>\
suspicion &amp;c.]; like as أَلَامَ signifies أَتَى بِمَا يُلَامُ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ [he did an act for which he was to be<br>\
blamed]: and agreeably with this signification is<br>\
expl. the verse ascribed to El-Mutalemmis, or to<br>\
Beshshár Ibn-Burdeh,<br>\
أَخُوكَ الَّذِى إِنْ رِبْتَهُ قَالَ إِنَّمَا<br>\
وَ إِنْ لَايَنْتَهُ لَانَ جَانِبُهْ ↓ أَرَبْتُ<br>\
[Thy brother is he who, if thou make him to<br>\
doubt, &amp;c., (or if thou do to him an act occasioning doubt, or suspicion &amp;c., as expl. in the Ham<br>\
p. 363, where عَاتَبْتَهُ is put in the place of لَايَنْتَهُ,)<br>\
says, Only I have done what occasions doubt,<br>\
&amp;c.; and if thou act gently with him, becomes<br>\
gentle]: thus the verse is correctly related: he<br>\
who relates it differently, saying أَرَبْتَ, [and thus<br>\
I find it in two copies of the T,] asserts that<br>\
إِنْ رِبْتَهُ means if thou make him of necessity to<br>\
have doubt, or suspicion &amp;c.; and ↓ اربت [here<br>\
said in the TA to be “ with damm,” but this is<br>\
evidently a mistranscription for “ with fet-h,”<br>\
for it cannot mean with damm to the ا, as أُرِبْتَ<br>\
does not bear an appropriate signification, nor<br>\
can it mean with damm to the ت, as the explanation relates to the reading of اربت with fet-h to<br>\
the ت,] means thou hast caused [me] to think<br>\
that there was that which occasioned doubt, or<br>\
suspicion &amp;c., when it was not decidedly necessary.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اراب, as a trans. verb: see 1, in eight places.<br>\
-A2-  As intrans., it signifies He (a man) was, or<br>\
became, one in whom was something occasioning<br>\
doubt, or suspicion or evil opinion, or doubt<br>\
combined with suspicion or evil opinion; i. e.<br>\
صَارَ ذَا رِيبَةِ: (Sb, T, S, M:) and he did a thing<br>\
that occasioned doubt, or suspicion &amp;c.: (As, T:)<br>\
it is said when one is told something of a person,<br>\
or thinks it, or imagines it: (Msb:) see 1, in the<br>\
former half of the paragraph; and also, in three<br>\
places, in the latter part of the same paragraph.<br>\
Also It (a thing, or an affair, or a case,) was, or<br>\
became, one in which was something occasioning<br>\
doubt, or suspicion &amp;c.; i. e. صَارَ ذَا رَيْبٍ (T, K)<br>\
or ذا رِيبَةٍ. (M.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَرَيَّبَ see the next paragraph.<br>\
8<br>\
ارتاب He doubted, (S, Msb, K,) فِيهِ [respecting him, or it]. (S.) See 1, in the former<br>\
half of the paragraph. And ارتاب بِهِ He suspected him, or thought evil of him: (T, M, K:)<br>\
or he saw on his part [or in him] what caused<br>\
him to have doubt, or suspicion &amp;c.; as also<br>\
به ↓ تريّب; (Har p. 257;) and به ↓ استراب; i. e.<br>\
رَأَى مِنْهُ مَا يَرِيبُهُ: (S, K, and Har ubi suprà:)<br>\
the last used by [the tribe of] Hudheyl. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [It often means particularly He was sceptical<br>\
in matters of religion.]<br>\
10<br>\
استراب He fell into that which occasioned<br>\
doubt, or suspicion or evil opinion; meaning he<br>\
feared so that he doubted of safety or security:<br>\
(Har pp. 256 and 257:) [he conceived doubt, or<br>\
suspicion or evil opinion:] he doubted: and<br>\
became infected with suspicion or evil opinion.<br>\
(Idem p. 309.) See also 8.<br>\
رَابٌ Want, or need. (TA.) Hence, in a trad.,<br>\
مَا رَبُكُمْ إِلَيْهِ What is [the reason of] your want of<br>\
him? or your wanting to ask him? (TA.) And, in<br>\
another trad., مَا رَابُكَ إِلَى قَطْعِهَا What is [the<br>\
reason of] thy wanting to cut it off? thus, says<br>\
El-Khattábee, they relate it, with damm to the<br>\
ب: but IAth says that it is properly مَا أَرَبُكَ,<br>\
meaning the same: or, accord. to Aboo-Moosà,<br>\
the right reading may be ما رَابَكَ, expl. in the<br>\
preceding paragraph. (TA.)<br>\
رَيْبٌ is an inf. n. of 1, (T, M, Mgh, Msb, &amp;c.,)<br>\
as also ↓ رِيبَةٌ, (M, K,) or the latter is a simple<br>\
subst.: (S, Msb:) the primary signification of the<br>\
latter [and of the former also when it is used as a<br>\
simple subst.] is Disquiet, disturbance, or agitation, of mind: (Ksh and Bd in ii. 1:) [and<br>\
hence] the former signifies doubt; (T, S, Msb;)<br>\
as also ↓ the latter; (S, Mgh;) because doubt<br>\
disquiets, or disturbs, the mind: (Ksh and Bd<br>\
ubi suprà, and Mgh:) and opinion; syn. ظَنٌّ:<br>\
(Msb:) and ↓ the latter, (S, M, A, Mgh, K,) and<br>\
the former also, (M, A, K,) doubt, or suspicion<br>\
or evil opinion; syn. تُهَمَةٌ (S, M, A, Mgh, K)<br>\
and ظِنَّةٌ: (M, A, K:) or the former, [and ↓ the<br>\
latter also,] doubt combined with suspicion or evil<br>\
opinion: (IAth, TA:) and a thing, or an event,<br>\
or a case, that occasions one doubt, or suspicion<br>\
or evil opinion, or doubt combined with suspicion<br>\
or evil opinion; i. e. مَا رَابَكَ مِنْ أَمْرٍ: (S, TA:)<br>\
[in this last sense, the latter is the more common:<br>\
hence,] lying is termed رِيبَةٌ in a trad. cited<br>\
above: see 1: (Mgh:) the ↓ pl. of the latter is<br>\
رِيَبٌ. (Msb.) A man, and a thing or an event<br>\
or a case, is said to be ↓ ذُو رِيبَةٍ [as meaning<br>\
Having in him, or it, something occasioning<br>\
doubt, or suspicion &amp;c.]. (A.) [لَا رَيْبَ often<br>\
occurs as meaning There is no doubt; without<br>\
doubt; undoubtedly.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, رَيْبُ الزَّمَانِ The<br>\
accidents, or evil accidents, of time, (Ksh and Bd<br>\
ubi suprà, [in Fleischer&#39;s ed. of the latter رِيَب<br>\
الزمان, which is more agreeable with the explanation, but رَيْب الزمان is more usual,]) that disquiet, or disturb, the minds and hearts: (Ksh:)<br>\
and رَيْبُ المَنُونِ (S, A) [which likewise signifies]<br>\
the accidents, or evil accidents, of time: (S:) and<br>\
رَيْبُ الدَّهْرِ signifies the same; i. e. صَرْفُهُ, (M, K,)<br>\
or صُرُوفُهُ, (T, Msb,) and حَوَادِثُهُ. (T. [This is<br>\
said in the TA to be tropical; but I do not find<br>\
it so characterized in the A.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, likewise,] رَيْبٌ also signifies A want; a needful, or<br>\
requisite, thing, affair, or business; syn. حَاجَةٌ.<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K.) A poet says, (S,) namely, Kaab<br>\
Ibn-Málik El-Ansáree, (TA,)<br>\
قَضَيْنَا مِنْ تِهَامَةَ كُلَّ رَيْبٍ<br>\
وَ خَيْبَرَ ثُمَّ أَجْيَيْنَا السُّيُوفَا<br>\
[We accomplished, from Tihámeh, every want,<br>\
and from Kheyber: then we gave rest to our<br>\
swords]. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  [ريب mentioned by Freytag as<br>\
applied in art. دلس of the S to a certain plant,<br>\
and written رَيْب in both of my copies of the S in<br>\
that art., is a mistake for رَبَب, which is the<br>\
reading in the TA, pl. of رِبَّةٌ.]<br>\
رِيبَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in six<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [It often means particularly Scepticism<br>\
in matters of religion.]<br>\
أَمْرٌ رَيَّابٌ A thing, or an event, or a case, that<br>\
frightens, or terrifies. (M, K.)<br>\
رَائِبٌ [act. part. n. of 1; Causing, or occasioning, doubt, or suspicion or evil opinion, &amp;c.]<br>\
IAar says that Aboo-Bekr is related to have said,<br>\
in his charge to &#39;Omar, عَلَيْكَ بِالرَّائِبِ مِنَ الأُمُورِ<br>\
وَ إِيَّاك وَ الرَّائِبَ مِنْهَا, which Th explains as meaning<br>\
Keep thou to what is clear, free from dubiousness<br>\
or confusedness, of affairs, and beware thou of, or<br>\
avoid thou, what has in it dubiousness, or confusedness, thereof: (T, TA:) the first is from<br>\
رَابَ of which the aor. is يَرُوبُ, said of milk; and<br>\
the second is from رَابَ of which the aor. is يَرِيبُ.<br>\
(TA.) [See also a verse cited voce رَائِبٌ in art.<br>\
روب, and my remark thereon.]<br>\
مُرِيبٌ, applied to a man, (T, S, A,) and to a<br>\
thing or an event, (M, A,) i. q. ذُو رِيبَةٍ [expl.<br>\
above, voce رَيْبٌ]. (T, S, M, A.) إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا فِى<br>\
شَكٍّ مُرِيبٍ, in the Kur xxxiv. last verse, means<br>\
Verily they were in doubt causing to fall into<br>\
suspicion or evil opinion: or it means ذِى رِيبَةٍ<br>\
[having in it something occasioning suspicion<br>\
&amp;c.]: (Ksh and Bd:) or ذِى رَيْبٍ [which means<br>\
the same: or attended with disquiet, or disturbance, or agitation, of mind]: (M, TA:) [see its<br>\
verb, 4:] it may be from the trans. or from the<br>\
intrans. verb. (Ksh.)<br>\
مُرْتَابٌ Doubting [or suspecting]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[It often means particularly Sceptical, or a sceptic,<br>\
in matters of religion.<br>\
-A2-  And مُرْتَابٌ فِيهِ, or بِهِ,<br>\
Doubted of, or suspected.]<br>\
