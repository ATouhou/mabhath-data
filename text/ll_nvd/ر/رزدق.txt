S, Msb, K:) or [simply] a row: (JK, Mgh:)<br>\
and an extended cord or string or thread: (JK:)<br>\
an arabicized word, from رَسْتَهْ, (S, K,) which<br>\
is Persian: (S:) Lth says, What the people [now]<br>\
call رَسْتَق we call رَزْدَق, meaning a row: it is an<br>\
adventitious word. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says,<br>\
اِجْعَلِ الأَمْرَ رَزْدَقًا وَاحِدًا, meaning Make thou the<br>\
affair, or case, [uniform, or] one uniform thing.<br>\
(Fr, TA in art. بأح.)<br>\
رُزْدَاقٌ (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and رُزْتَاقٌ (Lh, L, TA)<br>\
and رُسْدَاقٌ (ISk, K) and رُسْتَاقٌ, (Lh, S, Msb,<br>\
K, &amp;c.,) but this last disallowed by ISk,<br>\
(TA,) [though allowed by many others, and of<br>\
frequent occurrence,] and said by some to be<br>\
post-classical, and to be correctly رُزْدَاقٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
arabicized, (S, Msb, K,) of Pers. origin, (S,) from<br>\
رُوسْتَا, (K,) [erroneously] said by IF to be from<br>\
رَزْدَقٌ signifying as explained above; (Msb;) A<br>\
rural district; or district consisting of cultivated<br>\
land with towns or villages; syn. سَوَادٌ, (S,) or<br>\
سَوَادٌ and قُرًي: (K:) Yákoot explains رُسْتَاق as<br>\
applied, in his time, in the country of the Persians,<br>\
to any place [or district] in which are sown fields,<br>\
and towns or villages; not to cities, like El-Basrah<br>\
and Baghdád; so that it is, with the Persians,<br>\
like سَوَادٌ with the people of Baghdád, and is a<br>\
more special term than كُورَةٌ [in Arabic] and<br>\
إِسْتَان [in Persian]: (TA:) or it is used as meaning an outlying district, or a border-district, of a<br>\
country: (Msb:) [but the correctness of this last<br>\
explanation is questionable:] the pl. is رَزَادِيقُ<br>\
(Msb) [and رَزَاتِيقُ and رَسَادِيقُ] and رَسَاتِيقُ (S,<br>\
Msb) and رُزْدَاقَاتٌ (Har p. 249) [&amp;c.].<br>\
