رَضِعَ أُمَّهُ, aor.<br>\
رَضَعَ; and رَضَعَ, aor.<br>\
رَضِعَ; (S, Msb, *<br>\
K;) the former of the dial. of Tihámeh; (O, L;)<br>\
the latter of the dial. of Nejd; (S, O, L;) or the<br>\
former of the dial. of Nejd; and the latter of the<br>\
dial. of Tihámeh, and used by the people of<br>\
Mekkeh; (Msb;) and رَضَعَ, (Msb,) i. e. رَضَعَ<br>\
ثَدْىَ أُمِّهِ, (IKtt, TA,) aor.<br>\
رَضَعَ; (IKtt, Msb;)<br>\
inf. n. رَضَاعٌ, (S, Msb, K,) of the first, (S, TA,)<br>\
or of the third, (Msb,) and رِضَاعٌ, (K,) [which is<br>\
also an inf. n. of 3,] and رَضَعٌ, (Msb, K,) of the<br>\
first, (Msb, TA,) and رَضْعٌ, (S, Msb, K,) of the<br>\
second, (S, Msb,) and رَضِعٌ, (Msb, K,) said by<br>\
some to be the original form of the inf. n. of the<br>\
second, (Msb,) and رَضَاعَةٌ, (Msb, K,) of the third,<br>\
(Msb,) and رِضَاعَةٌ; (K;) or the last two are<br>\
simple substs. form رَضَاعٌ; (IAth;) said of a child;<br>\
(S, Msb;) He sucked the breast of his mother;<br>\
(K;) and ↓ ارتضع signifies the same. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
You say, هٰذَا أَخِى مِنَ الرَّضَاعَةِ [This is my<br>\
foster-brother]; and هٰذَا رَضِيعِى. (S, K. *) The<br>\
saying, in a trad., الرَّضَاعَةُ مِنَ المَجَاعَةِ, and<br>\
الرِّضَاعَةُ, means The sucking which occasions interdiction of marriage [with the woman whose<br>\
milk is sucked and certain of her relations] is<br>\
that of an infant when hungry; not of a child<br>\
that is grown up: (IAth:) or that consequent<br>\
upon hunger which is stopped by the milk in the<br>\
time of infancy of the child; not when the child&#39;s<br>\
hunger is only to be stopped by solid food. (Mgh<br>\
in art. جوع.) You also say, of a man, يَرْضَعُ إِبِلَهُ<br>\
(S, K) and غَنَمَهُ (S) [He sucks the teats of his<br>\
camels and of his ewes or she-goats, by reason of<br>\
his sordidness: see رَاضِعٌ]. ―<br>\
-b2-  رَضِعَ اللُّؤْمَ مِنْ ثَدْىِ<br>\
أُمِّهِ (tropical:)  [He sucked meanness, sordidness, or ignobleness, from the breast of his mother]; (K;)<br>\
i. e. he was born in meanness, sordidness, or ignobleness. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  يَرْضَعُ النَّاسَ (assumed tropical:)  He begs of men;<br>\
(K, TA;) asks gifts of them. (TA.) So, accord.<br>\
to IAar, in the saying of Jereer,<br>\
وَيَرْضَعُ مَنْ لَا قَى وَإِنْ يَرَ مُقْعَدًا<br>\
يَقُودُ بِأَعْمَى فَالْفَرَزْدَقُ سَائلُهْ<br>\
[And he begs of him whom he meets; and if he<br>\
see a cripple leading a blind person, El-Farezdak<br>\
asks of him]: but [properly speaking] the مُقعَد<br>\
is one who cannot stand, so as to lead the blind.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  هُوَ يَرْضَعُ الدُّنْيَا وَيَذُمُّهَا (tropical:)  [He sucks the<br>\
sweets of the present world, and dispraises it].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  رَضُعَ, (S, Z, K,) with damm, as though<br>\
what the verb denotes were natural to the person<br>\
of whom it is said, (S, TA,) or the verb has this<br>\
form because it is changed in meaning so as to be<br>\
intensive, (Z, TA,) aor.<br>\
رَضُعَ; and رَضَعَ, aor.<br>\
رَضِعَ; (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, K;) inf. n., (Z, K,) of the former verb,<br>\
(Z, TA,) رَضَاعَةً, (Z, K,) with fet- h only; (IAth,<br>\
TA;) (tropical:)  He (a man, S) was, or became, mean,<br>\
sordid, or ignoble: (S, * K, TA:) or he was, or<br>\
became, very mean, &amp;c.: (Z, TA:) [see رَاضَعٌ:]<br>\
or one says, لَؤُمَ وَرَضُعَ, for the sake of mutual<br>\
resemblance; and the meaning is, [he was, or<br>\
became, mean, sordid, or ignoble, and] he sucked<br>\
from the teat of the she-camel, fearing lest, if he<br>\
milked, any one should know of his doing so, and<br>\
demand of him somewhat. (Msb.)<br>\
-A3-  رَضَعَتْ أَلْبَانُهَا<br>\
(tropical:)  Their milk became little in quantity; said in<br>\
reference to milch-camels abounding with milk.<br>\
(TA. [But the context in the TA suggests that<br>\
this is a mistake; that the phrase is said of the<br>\
wind called رَضَاعَةٌ; and that the right reading is<br>\
رَضَعَتْ أَلْبَانَهَا; and the meaning, (assumed tropical:)  It rendered<br>\
their milk little in quantity.])<br>\
3<br>\
راضعهُ, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. مُرَاضَعَةٌ and رِضَاعٌ<br>\
(Msb, K, TA) and also رِضَاعَةٌ, (Msb,) [but this<br>\
last is anomalous, and, if correct, is probably<br>\
a simple subst.,] He sucked with him; or had<br>\
him sucking with him; (Msb, * K, * TA;) he had<br>\
him as his رَضِيع [or foster-brother]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] بَيْنَهُمَا رِضَاعُ الكَأْسِ (tropical:)  [Between them two<br>\
is the sipping of the wine-cup, or cup of wine].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  مُرَاضَعَةٌ also signifies An infant&#39;s sucking the breast of his mother while she has a child<br>\
in her belly. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  راضع ابْنَهُ He gave, or delivered, his son to the woman who should suckle<br>\
him. (S, K.) [See also 4.]<br>\
4<br>\
أَرْضَعَتْ She (a woman) had a child which<br>\
she suckled. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ذَاتُ إِرْضَاعٍ, also, signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Having milk, though not having a child that is<br>\
suckled. (IB.)<br>\
-A2-  أَرْضْعَتْهُ أُمُّهُ His mother suckled<br>\
him. (S, Msb, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also, أَرْضَعَ الوَلَدَ<br>\
[app. meaning He caused the child to be suckled:<br>\
or, perhaps, he suckled the child, by means of his<br>\
wife or a female slave; because his semen genitale<br>\
is considered as the source of the milk of a woman<br>\
who has borne him a child; accord. to a saying<br>\
of Lth, cited in an explanation of a usage of the<br>\
word لَقَاحٌ or لِقَاحٌ]. (K voce مَلَحَ, q. v.) [See<br>\
also 3.]<br>\
6<br>\
تراضعا They both sucked the breast of a<br>\
woman together; each with the other. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
ارتضع: see 1; first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  ارتضعت<br>\
العَنْزُ The she-goat drank [or sucked] her own<br>\
milk [from her udder]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence اِرْتِضَاعُ<br>\
الكَأْسِ (assumed tropical:)  The drinking [of the cup] of wine. (Har<br>\
p. 284: [See also 3.])<br>\
10<br>\
استرضع He sought, or demanded, a wetnurse. (K.) It is said in the Kur [ii. 233],<br>\
وَإِنْ أَرَدْتُمْ أَنْ تَسْتَرْضِعُوا أَوْلَادَكُمْ And if ye desire<br>\
to seek, or demand, wet-nurses for your children;<br>\
i. e., ان تسترضعوا اولادكم مَرَاضِعَ; the second<br>\
objective complement [accord. to this order of the<br>\
words], but the first in reality because the wetnurse is the agent with respect to the child, being<br>\
suppressed; for you say, اِسْتَرْضَعْتُ المَرْأَةَ وَلَدِى,<br>\
meaning I sought, or demanded, of the woman<br>\
that she should suckle my child: (IB:) accord.<br>\
to some, the verb is doubly trans.: accord. to<br>\
others, the prep. لِ is suppressed in the Kur;<br>\
the meaning being لِأَوْلَادِكُمْ. (El-Howfee, in the<br>\
“ Burhán fee tefseer-el-Kur-án. ”)<br>\
رِضْعٌ A kind of trees upon which camels feed.<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\
رَضَعٌ The young ones [or suckers] of palmtrees; (IAar, K;) as also رَصَعٌ, (K,) accord. to<br>\
Lth and IDrd and the S; (TA in art. رصع;) or<br>\
the latter, accord. to Az, is a mistranscription:<br>\
(K * and TA in that art.:) n. un. with ة. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  (tropical:)  Meanness, sordidness, or ignobleness; a subst.<br>\
from رَضُعَ; as also ↓ رَضِعٌ. (K.)<br>\
رَضِعٌ: see رَاضِعٌ, in two places:<br>\
-A2- : and see رَضَعٌ.<br>\
رَضِيعٌ A foster-brother; syn. ↓ مُرَاضَعٌ: pl. رُضَعَآءُ<br>\
(TA.) You say, هٰذَا رَضِيعِى, (S, Msb, * K, *) i. e.<br>\
هٰذَا أَخِى مِنَ الرَّضَاعَةِ [This is my foster-brother].<br>\
(S, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  [A child while it is a suckling;] a<br>\
child before it is termed فَطِيمٌ [i. e. weaned].<br>\
(IAar, TA in art. طبخ. [See also رَاضَعٌ.]) [In<br>\
explanations of the words وَطْبٌ and شَكْوَةٌ in the<br>\
S, it is applied as an epithet to a kid, evidently<br>\
as meaning Sucking; or a suckling; like رَاضِعٌ,<br>\
q. v., and رَضِعٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  See two other significations,<br>\
voce رَاضَغٌ, in two places.<br>\
رَضَاعَةٌ, said in the K to be an inf. n. of 1 in the<br>\
first of the senses explained in this art., is, accord.<br>\
to IAth, a simple subst. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is a regular<br>\
inf. n. of رَضُعَ, q. v.]<br>\
-A2-  الرَّضَاعَةُ also signifies<br>\
(tropical:)  The [west wind, or westerly wind, called] دَبُور:<br>\
or a wind between that and the [south wind, or<br>\
southerly wind, called] جَنُوب: (IDrd, K, TA:)<br>\
because, when it blows upon the milch-camels<br>\
abounding with milk, their milk becomes little in<br>\
quantity. (IDrd, TA.)<br>\
رِضَاعَةٌ, said in the K to be an inf. n. of 1 in the<br>\
first of the senses expl. in this art., is, accord. to<br>\
IAth, a simple subst. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is also said,<br>\
in the Msb, to be an inf. n. of رَاضَعَهُ, q. v.]<br>\
رَضُوعَةٌ A female that suckles her young: (TA:)<br>\
or a ewe or she-goat that suckles, or that has a<br>\
young one which she suckles. (AO, S, K.)<br>\
رَضَّاعٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
رَاضَعٌ Sucking the breast of his mother; a<br>\
suckling; as also ↓ رَضِعٌ: pl. of the former رُضَّعٌ;<br>\
and of the latter; رُضُعٌ. (K. [See also رَضِيعٌ, which<br>\
signifies the same; as is shown below, voce<br>\
مُرْضِعٌ; and by Bd in xxii. 2; &amp;c.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  One who<br>\
sucks from the teat of the she-camel, fearing lest,<br>\
if he milked, any one should know of his doing<br>\
so, and demand of him somewhat: (Msb:) or a<br>\
pastor who does not take with him a milkingvessel, and, when he is asked for milk, excuses<br>\
himself on that ground, (K, TA,) and, when he<br>\
desires to drink, sucks the teat of his milchbeast: (TA:) pl. رُضَّعٌ. (Msb.) The phrase<br>\
لَئِيمٌ رَاضِعٌ [i. e. Mean, sordid, or ignoble; who<br>\
sucks the teats of his she-camels, &amp;c.,] originated,<br>\
(S, K,) as they assert, (S,) from a certain man&#39;s<br>\
sucking the teats of his she-camels (S, K) or ewes<br>\
or she-goats, and not milking them, (S,) lest the<br>\
sound of his milking should be heard and somewhat should be demanded of him: (S, K:) or<br>\
the origin was the coming of a guest by night to<br>\
a certain man of the Amalekites, whereupon the<br>\
latter sucked the udder of his ewe, lest the guest<br>\
should hear the sound of the streaming of the<br>\
milk from the teat. (IDrd.) But when a single<br>\
epithet is used, one says ↓ رَضِيعٌ. (Msb. [See,<br>\
however, what follows.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  Mean,<br>\
sordid, or ignoble; (K, TA;) as also ↓ رَضِيعٌ and<br>\
↓ رَضَّاعٌ: pl. رُضَّعٌ and رُضَّاعٌ: (K:) and رَضِعُونَ, as<br>\
a pl., [i. e. pl. of ↓ رَضِعٌ,] has the same signification, of mean, &amp;c. (TA.) It is said in a trad. of<br>\
Selemeh Ibn-El-Akwa&#39;, اليُوْمَ يُوْمُ الرُّضَّعِ, meaning (tropical:)  To-day is the day of the destruction of the<br>\
mean, &amp;c. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (tropical:)  Mean, sordid, or<br>\
ignoble, who has sucked meanness, sordidness, or<br>\
ignobleness, from the breast of his mother; (ElYemámee, K, TA;) i. e. born in meanness, sordidness, or ignobleness. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (tropical:)  A beggar: (TA:)<br>\
one who begs of men: (K:) thus Ibn-&#39;Abbád<br>\
explains لَئِيمٌ رَاضِعٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  (assumed tropical:)  One who eats the<br>\
particles of food remaining between his teeth, lest<br>\
anything [thereof] should escape him: (K:) or<br>\
such is termed لَئِيمٌ رَاضِعٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  A possessor<br>\
of milk: after the usual manner of a possessive<br>\
epithet [like لَابِنٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
رَاضِعَةٌ A central incisor when it falls out:<br>\
(Msb:) or the رَاضِعَتَانِ are the two central incisors (S, Msb, K, TA) of a child, (S K, TA,)<br>\
over which the milk is drunk [or sucked]: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) pl. رَوَاضَعُ: (S, Msb, K:) or the رَوَاضِع<br>\
are the teeth of a child that grow and then fall<br>\
out in the period of sucking; (Msb, * TA;) and<br>\
they are said to be six in the upper part of the<br>\
mouth and six in its lower part: (TA:) [the pl.<br>\
is applied to all the milk-teeth of a child, and of a<br>\
horse &amp;c.; it applies to the teeth called رَبَاعِيَات<br>\
that fall out, as well as to the ثَنَايَا, or central<br>\
incisors, accord. to AO, in a passage relating to a<br>\
colt, in his كتاب الخيل quoted in the TA in art.<br>\
حفر; and to the teeth called قَوَارِح that fall out,<br>\
accord. to a passage in the S, voce أَحْفَرَ, q. v., as<br>\
well as the extract from the work of AO mentioned above, and in this case likewise relating to<br>\
a colt.]<br>\
مَرْضَعٌ The breast, as being the place of sucking:<br>\
pl. مَرَاضِعُ. (Ksh and Bd in xxviii. 11.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[as an inf. n.] The act of sucking the breast: pi.<br>\
as above. (Ksh and Bd ibid.)<br>\
مُرْضَعٌ Suckled: pl. مَرَاضَعُ; which is opposed<br>\
to فُطُمٌ, pl. of فَطِيمٌ. (Mgh.)<br>\
مُرْضِعٌ and مُرْضَعَةٌ A mother [or other woman]<br>\
suckling: (Msb:) or one having with her a child<br>\
which she suckles: the former epithet may with<br>\
reason be applied to the mother because suckling<br>\
is performed only by females, like as the epithets<br>\
حَائِضٌ and طَامِثٌ are applied to a woman; and<br>\
if مُرْضَعَةٌ were applied to her who has with her a<br>\
child, it would be correct: (Fr, TA:) [but see<br>\
another saying ascribed to Fr in what follows:]<br>\
or the former, a woman having a child which she<br>\
suckles; (Kh, S, IB, K;) after the manner of a<br>\
possessive epithet; (IB;) i. e. having a رَضِيع;<br>\
(Kh, IB;) like اِمْرَأَةٌ مُطْفِلٌ “ a woman having<br>\
a طِفْل; ” (Kh;) or ظَبْيَةٌ مُشْدِنٌ “ a doe-gazelle<br>\
having a شَادِن; ” though مُرْضِعٌ has a verb bearing a signification agreeing with this; and it<br>\
sometimes occurs as meaning having milk, though<br>\
not having a child that is suckled: (IB:) but<br>\
the latter is used in describing a woman as performing an action; (Kh;) signifying suckling a<br>\
child: (S, K:) the former is used when the<br>\
[abstract] quality is meant: the latter, when the<br>\
action is meant: but God knows: (Akh:) or the<br>\
former signifies one who is near to suckling, but<br>\
has not yet suckled: and one having with her the<br>\
child that is suckled [by her] (الصَّبِىُّ الرَّضِيعُ):<br>\
and the latter, [in the TA the former, but this is<br>\
a mistranscription, as is shown by what follows,]<br>\
one who is suckling, her teat being in the mouth<br>\
of her child; and in this sense it is used in the<br>\
Kur, in a passage which see below: (AZ in the<br>\
TA:) Th says, the latter signifies one who suckles,<br>\
though she have not a child, or if she have a<br>\
child: and the former, one who has not a child<br>\
with her, and sometimes having with her a child:<br>\
and in one place he says, when the action is<br>\
meant, the latter is used, and it is made an<br>\
epithet: and when the ة is not added, it is meant<br>\
as a subst: (TA:) Fr and some others say that<br>\
it is without ة when the proper signification of<br>\
suckling is meant: and with ة when the tropical<br>\
signification of a subject of the attribute of<br>\
suckling in time past or future is meant: (Msb:)<br>\
the pl. [of both, though said in the Mgh and TA<br>\
to be that of the former,] is مَرَاضِعُ (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA) and مَرَاضِيعُ. (Msb, TA.) The saying in the<br>\
Kur [xxii. 2], يَوْمَ تَرَوْنَهَا تَذْهَلُ كُلُّ مُرْضِعَةٍ عَمَّا<br>\
أَرْضَعَتْ means [On the day when ye shall see it,]<br>\
every woman that is suckling;, (AZ, Kh,) in the<br>\
act of doing so, (Kh,) with her teat in the mouth<br>\
of her child; (AZ,) [shall neglect, or become heedless of or diverted from, that which she shall have<br>\
been suckling:] or مرضعة here has the last signification explained in the preceding sentence [so that<br>\
the meaning is every woman who shall have been<br>\
suckling or shall be going to suckle]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
It is said in a trad., نِعْمَتِ المُرْضِعَةُ وَبِئْسَتِ الفَاطِمَةُ,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Excellent in the office of commander,<br>\
or governor, and the profit, or advantage, which<br>\
it brings to its possessor; and very evil is death,<br>\
which destroys his delights, or pleasures, and stops<br>\
the profits, or advantages, of that office. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  The pl. مَرَاضِيعُ is metaphorically applied as<br>\
an epithet to bees (جَوَارِس, i. e. نَحْل). (TA.)<br>\
مُرَاضَعٌ: see رَضِيعٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also An unborn child of a<br>\
woman who is suckling another child: such a<br>\
child proves to be meagre in body, slender in the<br>\
bones, and ill nourished. (En-Nadr, Sgh.)<br>\
مُسْتَرْضَعٌ [for مُسْتَرْضَعٌ لَهُ, agreeably with an opinion mentioned by El-Howfee, (see 10,) One for<br>\
whom a wet-nurse has been sought, or demanded].<br>\
You say, فُلَانٌ المُسْتَرْضَعُ فِى بَنِى تَمِيمٍ [Such a<br>\
one is he for whom a wet-nurse has been sought,<br>\
or demanded, among the Benoo-Temeem]. (TA.)<br>\
