which corn is measured], (T,) a large مِكْيَال,<br>\
(S, M, K,) in Egypt, (K,) [i. e.] of the people of<br>\
Egypt; (T, S;) or a certain measure of capacity<br>\
well known in Egypt; (Msb;) not correctly called<br>\
a مِكْيَال for they do not measure with it, but with<br>\
the وَيْبَة: (IB, TA:) it comprises, (يَضُمُّ, [so in<br>\
the M, but in copies of the K وَيُضَمُّ, which signifies that it is also pronounced with damm,]) as<br>\
they say, (M,) or it takes, (T,) twenty-four times<br>\
the measure called صَاع, (T, M, Msb, K,) of wheat,<br>\
(T,) i. e. sixty-four times the measure called مَنّ,<br>\
(T, Msb,) the منّ here meant being the منّ of<br>\
our country, (Az, [app. meaning El-&#39;Irák,]) and<br>\
the صاع being that of the Prophet: (Msb:) or<br>\
six وَيْبَات: (K:) the اردبّ of Egypt is six وَيْبَات;<br>\
the وَيْبَة being four أَرْبَاع; the رُبْع, four أَقْدَاح; and<br>\
the قَدَح, two hundred and thirty-two دَرَاهِم: (EsSuyootee in his “ Husn el-Mohádarah:”) the<br>\
half of the اردبّ is called قَنْقَلٌ: (T:) the word<br>\
اردبّ is affirmed by some to be arabicized: (MF:)<br>\
[it is now vulgarly pronounced أَرْدَبّ:] the pl. is<br>\
أَرَادِبُ. (Msb.) El-Akhtal says,<br>\
قَوْمٌ إِذَا اسْتَنْبَحَ الأَضْيَافُ كَلْبَهُمُ<br>\
قَالُوا لِأُمِّهِمُ بُولِى عَلَى النَّارِ<br>\
وَالخُبْزُ كَالعَنْبَرِ الهِنْدِىِّ عِنْدَهُمُ<br>\
وَالقَمْحُ سَبْعُونَ إِرْدَبًّا بِدِينَارِ<br>\
[Persons who, when the guests induce their dog<br>\
to bark, (see art. نبح,) say to their mother,<br>\
“ Make water on the fire: ” and bread is like<br>\
Indian ambergris in their judgment, while wheat<br>\
is seventy irdebbs for a deenár]: the former of<br>\
these two verses [whereof the latter only is cited<br>\
in the S] is said by As and others to be the most<br>\
severely-satirical verse uttered by any of the Arabs.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A conduit in which water flows<br>\
upon the surface of the ground. (M, K.)<br>\

baked clay: pl. إِرْدَبَّاتٌ: see دَاخِنَةٌ.] ―<br>\

a thing made of baked clay]: (M, TA:) or large<br>\
baked bricks; (S, K, TA;) which are called<br>\
قِرْمِيدٌ. (S, TA.)<br>\
