the latter erroneously written in [some of] the<br>\
copies of the K رِبَآء, (TA,) It (a thing, T, S, Msb)<br>\

Said, in this sense, of property: (Mgh:) or, said<br>\
of property, It increased by usury. (M, TA.)<br>\

عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ, in the Kur [xxx. 38], (T, Bd,) means<br>\
And what ye give of forbidden addition in commercial dealing, [i. e. of usury,] (Bd,) or what<br>\
ye give of anything for the sake of receiving more<br>\
in return, (Zj, T, Bd,) and this is not forbidden<br>\
accord. to most of the expositions, though there is<br>\
no recompense [from God] for him who exceeds<br>\
what he has received, (Zj, T,) in order that it<br>\
may increase the possessions of men, (T, * Bd,)<br>\
it shall not increase with God, (T, Bd,) nor will<br>\
He bless it: (Bd:) some (namely, the people of<br>\
El-Hijáz, T, or Náfi&#39; and Yaakoob, Bd) read<br>\
↓ لِتُرْبُوا, (T, Bd,) meaning, in order that ye may<br>\
increase [the property of men], or in order that<br>\
ye may have forbidden addition [or usury therein].<br>\

TA) and رُبْوٌ, (M, TA,) with damm, (TA,) this<br>\
latter on the authority of Lh, (M, TA,) accord.<br>\
to the K رَبْوٌ, with fet-h, but correctly with damm;<br>\
(TA;) and رَبِيتُ, (S, M, TA,) in the copies of<br>\
the K erroneously written رَبَيْتُ, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\

to the CK, رَبِىٌّ, which is a mistranscription;])<br>\
I grew up [among the sons of such a one, or in<br>\
his care and protection]. (S, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  رَبَتِ<br>\
الأَرْضُ The ground [being rained upon] became<br>\
large, and swelled. (M, TA.) In the Kur xxii. 5<br>\
and xli. 39, for وَرَبَتْ, some read وَرَبَأَتٌ: the<br>\
former means and [becomes large, and swells; or]<br>\
increases: the latter means “ and rises. ” (T.<br>\
[See art. ربأ.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  رَبَا السَّوِيقُ, inf. n. رُبُوٌّ, The سويق<br>\
[or meal of parched barley] had water poured<br>\
upon it, and in consequence swelled: (M, TA:)<br>\
in the copies of the K, رَبَا السَّوِيقَ, expl. as meaning he poured water on the سويق, and it consequently swelled. (TA.) ―<br>\

affected with what is termed رَبْوٌ; (S, M, K;) i. e.<br>\
he was, or became, out of breath; his breath<br>\
became interrupted by reason of fatigue or running &amp;c.; or he panted, or breathed shortly or<br>\
uninterruptedly; syn. اِنْبَهَرَ: (TA:) and so ↓ تربّى;<br>\
for you say, طَلَبْنَا الصَّيْدَ حَتَّى تَرَبَّيْنَا, i. e. [We pursued the chase until] we became out of breath;<br>\

grows, or increases, such as a child, and seedproduce, and the like; (S;) as also ↓ تَرَبَّيْتُهُ:<br>\
(Mgh, K:) the former is said to be originally<br>\
رَبَبْتُهُ. (Er-Rághib, TA. [See 1 in art. رب, in<br>\
two places.]) [Thus رَبَّيْتُ signifies I reared, or<br>\
cultivated, plants or trees.] And ربّى is said of<br>\
earth, or soil, meaning It fostered plants or herbage. (L in art. رشح, &amp;c.) And يُنَوِّرُ وَلَا يُرَبِّى<br>\
is said of a tree [as meaning It produces blossoms,<br>\
but does not mature its produce]. (AHn, M and<br>\
L in art. مظ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَبَّيْتُ الأْتْرُجَّ بِعَسَلٍ (tropical:)  [I preserved the citron with honey], and الوَرْدَ بِسُكَّرٍ [the<br>\
roses with sugar: like رَبَّبْتُهُ]. (TA.) ―<br>\

عَنْ خِنَاقِهِ [in the CK خُناقِه, which I think a<br>\
mistranscription,] (tropical:)  I removed, or eased, [his<br>\

meaning, his straitness;] (K;) mentioned by Z.<br>\

TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَرْبَيْتُهُ (in [some of] the copies of the K,<br>\
erroneously, ارتبيته, TA) I increased, or augmented, it. (M, K, TA.) Hence, in the Kur<br>\
[ii. 277], وَيُرْبِى الصَّدَقَاتِ (M, TA) And He will<br>\
increase, or augment, alms-deeds; (Jel;) will<br>\

bless them. (Bd.) See also an ex. in the first<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  أَرْبَيْتُ I took more than I gave.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اربى, said of a man, signifies<br>\

الرِّبَا [i. e. the practising, or taking, of usury or<br>\
the like; he practised, or took, usury or the like;<br>\
as also ↓ رَبَا, aor. رَبْوٌ; for] إِرْبَآءٌ and رَبْوٌ, as inf. ns.,<br>\
both signify, in Pers., رِبَا خوُرْدَنْ. (KL. [In the<br>\
TA, رَبَا, said of a man, is expl. by the words<br>\
حصل فى ربوة: but I think that the right reading<br>\
must be حَصَّلَ فِى رِبًوا, or مِنْ رِبًوا; and the<br>\
meaning, He acquired in the practice of usury<br>\
or the like, or he acquired of usury or the like.])<br>\
See, again, an ex. in the first paragraph. ―<br>\

عَلَى الخَمْسَينَ, (M, Msb,) وَنَحْوِهَا, (M,) He<br>\
exceeded [the age of fifty, and the like]. (M,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [أَرْبَى said of the عَرْفَج, in a copy of the<br>\
S, in art رقط is a mistranscription for أَدْبَى,<br>\
with dál.]<br>\
5<br>\
تربّى, said of a child, (Mgh, Msb,) He was,<br>\
or became, fed, or nourished; (Mgh;) or reared,<br>\
fostered, or brought up. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1,<br>\
near the end of the paragraph.<br>\
-A3-  تَرَبَّيْتُهُ: see 2.<br>\
رَبْوٌ: see رُبْوَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A company (IAar, T,<br>\
K, TA) of men: (IAar, T, TA:) pl. أَرْبَآءُ: (IAar,<br>\
T, K, TA:) and ↓ رِبْوَةٌ likewise signifies a company; or, as some say, ten thousand; as also<br>\
رُبَّةٌ; (M, TA;) or the former of these two words,<br>\
(i. e. ربوة,) accord. to the A, signifies a great<br>\
company of men, such as ten thousand. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in the K that ↓ رِبْوَةٌ signifies Ten thousand dirhems; as also ↓ رُبَةٌ: but in this assertion<br>\
are errors; for the former of these two words<br>\
signifies as explained in the foregoing sentence;<br>\
and the latter of them is with teshdeed, belonging<br>\
to art. رب, and signifies a company [or great<br>\
company] of men. (TA.)<br>\

TA,) and ↓ رَبْوَةٌ, (M, TA,) The state of being out<br>\
of breath; interruption of the breath by reason<br>\

(T, M, TA,) and اِنْبِهَارٌ: (TA:) or a loud (lit.<br>\
high) breathing: (S:) and a state of inflation of<br>\
the جَوْف [or chest]. (M, TA.) [The former<br>\
word is now often used as signifying Asthma.]<br>\
رِبًا, (T, M, Msb, K,) or ↓ رِبًوا, (S, Mgh,) [for it<br>\
is often thus written, and generally thus in the<br>\
copies of the Kur-án,] with the short ا accord. to<br>\
the pronunciation best known, (Msb,) [which<br>\
implies that it is also pronounced ↓ رِبَآءٌ,] An excess,<br>\
and an addition: (Msb:) an addition over and<br>\
above the principal sum [that is lent or expended]:<br>\
but in the law it signifies an addition obtained in<br>\
a particular manner: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [i. e.<br>\
usury, and the like; meaning both unlawful, and<br>\
lawful, interest or profit; and the practice of<br>\
taking such interest or profit:] it is in lending,<br>\
(Zj, T,) or in buying and selling, (S,) and in<br>\
giving: and is of two kinds; unlawful, and lawful: the unlawful is any loan for which one receives more than the loan, or by means of which<br>\
one draws a profit; [and the gain made by such<br>\
means:] and the lawful is a gift by which a man<br>\
invites more than it to be given to him, or a gift<br>\
that he gives in order that more than it may be<br>\
given to him; [and the addition that he so obtains:]<br>\
(Zj, T:) [it generally means] an addition that is<br>\
obtained by selling food [&amp;c.] for food [&amp;c.],<br>\
or ready money for ready money, to be paid at<br>\
an appointed period; or by exchanging either of<br>\
such things for more of the same kind: (Bd in ii.<br>\
276:) or the taking of an addition in lending and<br>\
in selling: (PS:) [it is said to be] i. q. عِينَةٌ:<br>\
(M, K:) [but although رِبًا and عِينَةٌ are both<br>\
applicable sometimes in the same case, neither of<br>\
them can be properly said to be generally<br>\
explanatory of the other, or syn. therewith:<br>\
رِبَا النَّسِيْئَةِ is a term specially employed to signify<br>\
profit obtained in the case of a delay of payment:<br>\
and رِبَا الفَضْلِ to signify profit obtained by the<br>\
superior value of a thing received over that of a<br>\
thing given:] the dual of رِبًا (M, Msb, K) or رِبًوا<br>\
(S) is رِبَوَانِ and رِبَيَانِ; (S, M, Msb, K;) the<br>\
former being agreeable with the original; (M,<br>\
Msb;) the ى in the latter being because of the<br>\
imáleh occasioned by the preceding kesreh. (M.)<br>\
See an ex. near the beginning of the first paragraph<br>\
of this art. ↓ رُبْيَةٌ, thus pronounced by the Arabs,<br>\
but by the relaters of a trad., in which it occurs,<br>\
↓ رُبِّيَّةٌ, (Fr, T, S, Mgh,) or, as some say, ↓ رُبَيَّةٌ,<br>\
as though this were the dim. of رُبْيَةٌ, (Mgh,) is a<br>\
dial. var. of رِبًوا [or رِبًا]; and by rule should be<br>\
رُبْوَةٌ: (Fr, T, S, Mgh:) or, accord. to Z, رُبّيَّةٌ may<br>\
be of the measure فُعُّولَةٌ from الرِّبَا. (TA.) [See<br>\

and the pl. of ↓ رَابِيَةٌ is رَوَابٍ; (T, Msb;) which<br>\
ISh explains as meaning elevated sands, like the<br>\
دَكْدَاكَة [q. v.], but higher and softer than the<br>\
latter; the latter being more compact and rugged;<br>\
the رابية, he says, has in it depression and elevation; it produces the best and the most numerous<br>\
of the herbs, or leguminous plants, that are found<br>\
in the sands; and men alight upon it. (T.)<br>\
