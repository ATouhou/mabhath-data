رَافَ, aor. يَرِيفُ, He (a man of the desert)<br>\
came to the رِيف; (T, O, K;) as also ↓ أَرْيَفَ and<br>\
↓ تريّف: (K:) or he entered the region, district,<br>\
or tract, of cities, towns, or villages, and of cultivated land: or رَافُوا signifies they approached the<br>\
رِيف; and so ↓ تريّفوا: (Ham p. 676:) or this last,<br>\
they journeyed to the رِيف; (M;) and so ↓ أَرْيَفُوا:<br>\
(S, * M:) or ↓ تريّفنا, we abode, or stayed, in [a<br>\
region of] cities, towns, or villages, and where<br>\
water was reached by digging, or where it was<br>\
apparent, running upon the surface of the earth.<br>\
(T.) ―<br>\

رايف لِلظِّنَّةِ He was, or became, near to<br>\
[having, or incurring] الظِّنَّة [i. e. suspicion, or<br>\
evil opinion]; syn. قَارَفَهَا, and طَنَّفَ لَهَا. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O, K.) [Freytag, app. misled by the<br>\
TK, renders رايف, followed by ل, as meaning<br>\
“ Falsa protulit, calumniis accusavit. ” He also<br>\
assigns to رايف the signification of “ Adpropinquavit regioni ريف,” as on the authority of the<br>\
Ham; in which I do not find it.]<br>\

M, K,) inf. n. إِرَافَةٌ and [accord. to some] ↓ رِيفٌ;<br>\

[ISd says,] in my opinion, إِرَافَةٌ is the inf. n., and<br>\
رِيفٌ is the subst.; and in like manner one should<br>\
say of إِخْصَابٌ and خِصْبٌ; (M, TA;) The land<br>\
abounded, or became abundant, with herbage, and<br>\
with the goods, conveniences, or comforts, of life;<br>\
