روّأ فِى الأَمْرِ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,)<br>\
inf. n. تَرْوِئَةٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) or تَرْوِيَةٌ, (so in one of<br>\
my copies of the S,) after the manner of a verb<br>\
with an infirm final radical, like تَزْكِيَةٌ, inf. n. of<br>\
زَكَّى, (TA,) and تَرْوِىْءٌ, (S, K,) agreeably with<br>\
analogy; (TA;) and, accord. to IDrst, in his<br>\
Expos. of the Fs, رَوَّى also is allowable; but the<br>\
former is the original; or, accord. to the L, the<br>\
former is anomalous, like حَلَّأْتُ in the phrase<br>\
حَلَّأْتُ السَّوِيقَ; (TA;) He looked into the thing,<br>\
or affair, or case; inspected it; examined it;<br>\
considered it; or thought upon it; (S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K;) and thought upon it repeatedly; syn.<br>\
تَعَقَّبَهُ; (M, L, K, TA;) i. e. رَدَّدَ فِيهِ فِكْرَهُ; (TA;)<br>\
not hastening to reply: (S, K:) and رَيَّأَ signifies<br>\
the same; (K in art. ريأ;) i. q. فَكَّرَ; (T;) or,<br>\
accord. to some, it is a mispronunciation. (MF.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, يَوْمُ التَّرْوِيَةِ The eighth day of [the<br>\
month] Dhu-l-Hijjeh; originally with ء: its<br>\
derivation from الرُّؤْيَةُ is a mistake; and its derivation from الرِّىُّ requires consideration. (Mgh.)<br>\
[See 2 in art. روى.]<br>\

أَرْوَأَ It (a place) abounded with the [kind of<br>\
plant, or tree, called] رَآء: (AZ, AAF, K:) or so<br>\
أَرْوَأَتْ, said of land (أَرْض). (M.)<br>\
رَآءٌ A kind of [plant, or] tree, (T, * S, M, K,<br>\
&amp;c.,) that grows in plain, or soft, land, (T, M,<br>\
TA,) having a white fruit: or, as some say, a<br>\
kind of dust-coloured tree, having a red fruit:<br>\
(M, TA:) n. un. رَآءَةٌ: (T, S, M, K:) and dim.<br>\
↓ رُوَيْئَةٌ: (M, TA:) AHn says that the رآءة is not<br>\
taller nor broader than a sitting man: and<br>\
accord. to one of the Arabs of the desert of<br>\
&#39;Omán, it is a tree that rises on a stem, and then<br>\
there branch forth [so in the M, but accord. to<br>\
the TA, rise,] from it round, rough leaves:<br>\
others, he adds, say that it is a small tree of the<br>\
mountains, resembling an عظلمة [q. v.], having a<br>\
soft white flower like cotton: (M, TA: [but in<br>\
the latter, the word rendered “ soft ” is omitted:])<br>\
some say that it is a species of the kind of tree<br>\
called طَلْح [acacia, or mimosa, gummifera], and<br>\
is the tree that grew at the cave in which were the<br>\
Prophet and Aboo-Bekr: so say Suh and others:<br>\
it is, they say, of the height of a man, and has<br>\
white flowers, resembling cotton, with which<br>\
cushions are stuffed, like feathers in lightness and<br>\
softness: it is said by IHsh to be the same [tree]<br>\
that is called أُمُّ غَيْلَان [see art. غيل]; but they<br>\
have found fault with him. [for so saying]: it is<br>\
not the عُشَر [asclepias gigantea], as one author<br>\
has supposed; but a tree resembling this: (MF,<br>\
TA:) such is the truth: the رآء is not the عشر: I<br>\
have seen them both [says SM] in El-Yemen;<br>\
and with the fruit of each of them cushions and<br>\
pillows are stuffed: but the fruit of the عشر commences small; then increases to the size of the<br>\
باذنجانة [or fruit of the egg-plant, and much<br>\
larger, like a bladder]; and then breaks open,<br>\
disclosing what is like cotton: and the fruit of<br>\
the رآء is not thus: the عشر [he adds] is not found<br>\
in Egypt; but it and the رآء are peculiar to El-<br>\
Hijáz and the neighbouring parts; [in saying<br>\
this, however, he errs; for I have seen the عشر in<br>\
abundance in the deserts of the upper part of the<br>\
Sa&#39;eed;] and the saddles of camels &amp;c. are stuffed<br>\
with the fruit of the رآء in El-Hijáz. (TA.) ―<br>\

رَايَةٌ, in art. رى.<br>\
رَوِيْئَةٌ, or, as some say, only رَوِيَّةٌ, without ء;<br>\
(M;) the latter was the usual form, without ء;<br>\
(S, Msb;) or each; (K;) a subst. from رَوَّأَ فِى;<br>\
الأَمْرِ; (S, K;) meaning Inspection, examination,<br>\
consideration, or thought; (S, * M, Msb, K; *) and<br>\
repeated inspection or examination or consideration; (M, * Msb, K, * TA;) or consideration of<br>\
the issues, or results, of an affair; (Msb;) without haste to reply. (S, * K, * TA.) You say, فُلَانٌ<br>\
لَيْسَ لَهُ رَوِيَّةٌ [Such a one has no inspection, &amp;c.].<br>\
(T.) It precedes what is termed عَزِيمَةٌ [i. e. resolution, or determination, &amp;c.], and follows what<br>\
is termed بَدِيهَةٌ [i. e. intuitive knowledge, &amp;c.]:<br>\
one has well said,<br>\
بَدِيهَتُهُ تَحُلُّ عُرَى المَعَانِى<br>\
إِذَا انْغَلَقَتْ فَتَكْفِيهِ الرَّوِيَّهْ<br>\
[His intuitive knowledge undoes the loops of<br>\
meanings when they are fast closed, and inspection suffices him]. (Har p. 8.) [See also رَوِيَّةٌ in<br>\
