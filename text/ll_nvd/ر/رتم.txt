he broke (M) the nose: (M, K: [but see رَتْمٌ,<br>\

(M, TA,) and ↓ ترتّم, (M, K,) He had a thread,<br>\

Ibn-Hajar says,<br>\
لَأَصَبَحَ رَتْمًا دُقَاقَ الحَصَى<br>\
مَكَانَ النَّبِىِّ مِنَ الكَاثِبِ<br>\
(S, in the present art.,) i. e. It (referring to a<br>\
mountain called الصَاقِب) would become [broken,<br>\
having the pebbles crushed,] like the sands around<br>\
the mountain El-Káthib. (S in art. نبو. [But<br>\
there are other explanations of النبىّ and الكاثب as<br>\
here used. In the T, in art. رثم, a different<br>\
reading is given: لاصبح رَثْمًا.])<br>\
-A2-  See also رَتِيمَةٌ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Freytag, misled by the CK, has assigned to<br>\
رَتْمٌ a signification that belongs to رَتَمٌ.]<br>\
رَتَمٌ [applied in the present day to The shrub<br>\
broom; to several species thereof: spartium<br>\
monospermum of Linn.: genista rætam of Forsk.:<br>\
(Delile, Flor. Aegypt. Illustr., no. 657:) spartium: (Forskål, Flora Aegypt. Arab., p. lvi.:)<br>\
and phalaris setacea: (Idem, p. lx.:)] a species<br>\
of plant: (T:) or a species of tree; (Mgh;) or<br>\
so ↓ رَتَمَةٌ; of which the former is the pl. [or<br>\
rather coll. gen. n.]: (S:) or the latter, (Lth, T,)<br>\
or the former, (AHn, M, K,) the latter being its<br>\
n. un., (K,) a certain plant, of the shrub-kind;<br>\
(AHn, T, M, K;) as though by reason of its<br>\
slenderness, it were likened to the thread, or<br>\
string, called رَتَمِ: (AHn, T, * K, * TA: [see this<br>\
word voce رَتِيمَةٌ: in the CK, in the present<br>\
instance, erroneously written رَقْم:]) and so ↓ رَتِيمَةٌ:<br>\
(AHn, T:) its flower is like the خِيرِىّ [or yellow<br>\
gilliflower], and its seed is like the lentil: each of<br>\
these (i. e. the flower and the seed, TA) strongly<br>\
provokes vomiting: the drinking the expressed<br>\
juice of its twigs, fasting, is a beneficial remedy<br>\
for sciatica (عِرْقُ النَّسَا); and likewise the using as<br>\
a clyster an infusion thereof in sea-water: and<br>\
the swallowing twenty-one grains thereof, fasting,<br>\
prevents the [pustules called] دَمَامِيل. (K.)<br>\
When a man was about to make a journey, he<br>\
betook himself to two branches, or two trees, and<br>\
tied one branch to another, and said, “If my<br>\
wife be faithful to the compact, this will remain<br>\
tied as it is; otherwise, she will have broken the<br>\
compact: ” so says As; and ISk says the like:<br>\
(T:) or he betook himself to a tree, (S, K,) or to<br>\
the species of tree called رَتَم, (ISk, Mgh,) and<br>\
tied together two branches thereof, (ISk, S, Mgh,<br>\
K,) or he tied together two trees; (M;) and if he<br>\
returned and found them as he tied them, he said<br>\
that his wife had not been unfaithful to him;<br>\
but otherwise, that she had been so: (ISk, S,<br>\
M, Mgh, K:) this [pair of branches or trees] is<br>\
called الرَّتَمُ [in the CK, erroneously, الرَّتْمُ] and<br>\
↓ الرَّتِيمَةُ: (K:) or this is what is meant by<br>\
↓ الرَّتِيمَةُ: (M:) or this [action] is what is meant<br>\
by تَعْقَادُ الرَّتَمِ in the following verse: (As, ISk,<br>\
T, Mgh:) but IB says that الرَّتَائِمُ [pl. of ↓ الرَّتِيمَةُ]<br>\
does not mean peculiarly one kind of trees exclusively of others: and he cites this verse as an<br>\
ex. of الرَّتَمُ meaning the threads, or strings, so<br>\
called; (TA;) as does AZ. (Mgh.) A rájiz says,<br>\
هَلْ يَنْفَعَنْكَ اليَوْمَ إِنْ هَمَّتْ بِهِمْ<br>\
كَثْرَةُ مَا تُوصِى وَتَعْقَادُ الرَّتَمْ<br>\
[Will the muchness of thine enjoining, and the<br>\
tying of the retem, be indeed of use to thee to-day,<br>\
if she be desirous of them?]. (T, S, Mgh.) ―<br>\

-A2-  Also A [leathern<br>\
water-bag such as is called] مَزَادَة that is filled<br>\

رَتِيمَةٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, K) and ↓ رَتَمَةٌ, (T, M, L,)<br>\
the latter written thus by IB on the authority of<br>\
&#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh, (L, TA,) or ↓ رَتْمَةٌ, (S, K, [in<br>\
one copy of the S written رَتَمة, and in my copy<br>\
of the Mgh without any syll. signs,] A thread,<br>\
or string, that is tied upon the finger for the<br>\
purpose of reminding one (T, S, M, Mgh, K) of<br>\
some object of want: (T, S:) pl. of the first,<br>\
رَتَائِمُ (S, M, Mgh, K) and رِتَامٌ; (M, K;) and<br>\
[coll. gen. n.] of the second, ↓ رَتَمٌ; (M, IB;) and<br>\
of the third, [if it be correct,] ↓ رَتْمٌ: (K: in the<br>\
CK رُتْمٌ:) IAar says that ↓ رَتِيمٌ signifies the<br>\
thread, or string, for reminding; but others say<br>\
رَتِيمةٌ: Lth says that ↓ رَتِمٌ signifies a thread, or<br>\
string, that is tied upon the finger, or upon the<br>\
signet-ring, for a sign, or token: (T:) and IB<br>\
cites the verse cited above voce رَتَمٌ as an ex. of<br>\
this word in the sense here assigned to it as a pl.<br>\
[or coll. gen. n.]; (TA;) and so does AZ. (Mgh.)<br>\
The binding of رَتَائِم [upon the fingers] is forbidden<br>\
in a trad.: and it is said that المُسْتَذْكِرُ بِالرَّتَائِمِ<br>\
مُسْتَهْدفٌ للشَّتَائم [He who seeks to remember by<br>\
means of the threads, or strings, that are tied<br>\
upon the fingers for the purpose of reminding<br>\
becomes a butt for revilings]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
رَتَمٌ, in four places.<br>\
رُتَامَي [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned], like سُكَارَي, Persons affected with swooning from eating the plant called الرَّتَم. (K.)<br>\
مَا زَالَ رَاتِمًا عَلَي هٰذَا الأَمْرِ means He ceased not<br>\
to be constantly occupied in this affair: (T, M,<br>\
K, * TA:) Yaakoob asserts that the م of راتما is a<br>\
substitute [for ب], though رَتَمَ does not occur in<br>\
the sense of رَتَبَ: (M, TA:) IJ says that this<br>\
may be the case, or that the word may be from<br>\
الرَّتَمَةُ and الرَّتِيمَةُ. (TA.) [See also رَاتبٌ: and see<br>\
تُرْتُمٌ, below.]<br>\
أَرْتَمُ [app. Having his nose broken. ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
hence,] One who does not speak clearly, nor<br>\
intelligibly; as though his nose were broken:<br>\
occurring in a trad.: or, as some relate it, أَرْثَمُ<br>\
[q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
شَرُّ تُرْتُمٌ and تُرْتَمٌ Continual, or constant, evil:<br>\
(K, TA:) the م is a substitute for the ب of<br>\
تُرْتَُب; and the former ت is augmentative, because<br>\
there is no word like جُعْفَرٌ consisting of radical<br>\
letters. (TA.) [See also رَاتِمًا, above.]<br>\
