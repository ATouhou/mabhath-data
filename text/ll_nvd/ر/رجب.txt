any one should climb it, and pluck its fruit:<br>\
(T, TA:) or [in the CK “ and ”] the attaching<br>\

shake off the fruit: (K, TA:) or the putting<br>\
thorns round the racemes of a palm-tree, lest<br>\
anyone should be able to take and eat them:<br>\

↓ فَأَرْجَبُوهَا, meaning [Their palm-trees became<br>\
laden, or heavily laden, with fruit,] and they<br>\
consequently propped them up. (A. [But the<br>\
verb, here, may perhaps be mistranscribed; for<br>\
the verb commonly known in this sense is not<br>\
mentioned in the copy of the A from which this<br>\

كَأَنَّ أَعْنَاقَهَا أَنْصَابُ تَرْجِيبِ<br>\

رَجَبٌ One of the [Arabian] months; (Msb;)<br>\
[namely, the seventh thereof;] so called because<br>\
of the honour in which it was held in the Time of<br>\
Ignorance, (S, A, * K, *) inasmuch as war, or<br>\
fighting, during it was held unlawful: (S:) in a<br>\
trad., (TA,) it is called رَجَبُ مُضَرَ [Rejeb of<br>\
Mudar], because Mudar most honoured it: (S,<br>\
TA:) and it is further distinguished as being<br>\
between جَمَادَى and شَعْبَان, to show that what<br>\
is meant by it is not what the [pagan] Arabs<br>\
called رجب according to the computation founded<br>\
upon postponement; for they used to postpone<br>\
it from month to month: (TA:) [it is also called<br>\
رَجَبٌ الفَرْدُ Rejeb the separate; because it is the<br>\
only sacred month that is not preceded nor followed by another sacred month; the other sacred<br>\
months being المُحَرَّمُ and ذُو القَعْدَةِ and ذُو<br>\
الحَجَّةِ:] the pl. is أِرْجَابٌ (S, Msb, K) and أَرْجِبَةٌ<br>\
and أَرْجُبٌ [all pls. of pauc.] (Msb) and رُجُوبٌ<br>\
and رِجَابٌ and رَجَبَاتٌ (Msb, K) and رَجُوبٌ [or<br>\
rather this last is a quasi-pl. n.] (TA) and [pl.<br>\
pl.] أَرَاجِبُ [pl. of أَرْجُبٌ] and أَرَاجِيبُ [pl. of<br>\
أَرْجَابٌ]. (Msb.) The dual, رَجَبَانِ, (S, Msb,) or<br>\
الرَّجَبَانِ, (A,) [The two Rejebs] is applied to [the<br>\
two months] رَجَبٌ and شَعْبَانُ, (S, A, Msb,) by<br>\
the attribution of predominance to the former.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  See also أَرْجَابٌ.<br>\
رُجْبَةٌ A thing by means of which a tree is<br>\
propped up, because of the abundance of its<br>\
fruit, lest its branches should break: sometimes<br>\
it is a wall built for it to rest upon, because of its<br>\
weakness: (S:) a wall, or the like, built round a<br>\
palm-tree, for it to rest upon, because of its<br>\
heaviness or its weakness: (Mgh in art. عرو and<br>\
عرى:) a kind of wide bench of stone or brick<br>\
(دُكَّانٌ) built at the foot of a palm-tree, for it to<br>\
rest upon, (K, TA,) because of its leaning, and<br>\
being valuable to its owner, and being weak:<br>\
(TA:) accord. to As, a structure of rock with<br>\
which a palm-tree is supported by means of forked<br>\
pieces of wood: (TA:) it is also called رُجْمَةٌ:<br>\
(K * and TA in art. رجم:) pl. رُجَبٌ. (S.) [See 2.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also A structure by means of which (S, K)<br>\
the wolf &amp;c., (S,) or objects of the chase, (K,)<br>\
are caught: (S, K:) a piece of flesh-meat is put<br>\
in it, and tied with a small cord; and when the<br>\
beast pulls it, the رجبة falls upon him. (S.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also رِاجِبَةٌ.<br>\
رَجَبِيَّةٌ A victim, (Mgh, TA,) [i. e.] a sheep or<br>\
goat, (Msb,) which the Arabs used to sacrifice,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, TA,) in the Time of Ignorance, to<br>\
their gods (Msb) in Rejeb, (Mgh, Msb, TA,)<br>\
the month thus called: (TA:) the doing of which<br>\
is forbidden: (Msb:) it was abrogated by the<br>\
ordinance of the أَضْحَى. (Mgh.) See 2.<br>\
نَخْلَةٌ رُجَبِيَّةٌ A palm-tree having a رُجْبَة to<br>\
support it; (S, * Mgh in art. عرو and عرى, and<br>\

Kr, the sing. of this latter is ↓ رُجْبَةٌ [also mentioned as a sing. in the K]; but the correctness of this is doubted: (TA:) the رواجب are<br>\
The finger-joints that are next to the ends of<br>\
the fingers: (S, K:) next to these are the بَرَاجِم:<br>\
then, the أَشَاجِع, which are next to the كَفّ:<br>\
(S:) or the joints of the lowest parts (أُصُول) of<br>\
the fingers: (K: [by which is meant the same as<br>\
by the former explanation, accord. to the TA;<br>\
though this seems to be more than doubtful:])<br>\
or the inner sides of those joints: or the bones of<br>\
the fingers: (K:) or the finger-joints: (A, K:)<br>\
or the backs of the سُلَامَيَات [generally meaning<br>\
the phalanges of the fingers]: or the parts of the<br>\
سُلَامَيَات between the بَرَاجِم; (K;) which last<br>\
word [commonly signifies the knuckles, and] is<br>\
explained by IAar as signifying the wrinkled<br>\
parts at the joints of the fingers; whereof each<br>\
finger has three, except the thumb: or the<br>\
رواجب are the parts, of the inner sides, between<br>\
the finger-joints: or [the knuckles next the metacarpal bones; i. e.] the parts that protuberate at<br>\
the roots of the fingers when the hand is clinched.<br>\

أَنَا عُذَيْقُهَا المُرَجَّبُ means I am their propped<br>\
little palm-tree loaded with fruit; (S, * TA;)<br>\

so accord. to Yaakoob: or, as some say, I am<br>\
their honoured little palm-tree &amp;c. (TA. [See 2.])<br>\
[It is part of a prov., for which see جِذْلُ.]<br>\
