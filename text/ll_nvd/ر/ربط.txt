رَبَطَ, (S, Mgh, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
رَبِطَ and<br>\
رَبُطَ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. رَبْطٌ, (Msb, TA,) He tied, bound, or<br>\
made fast, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) a thing, (S, Msb, *<br>\
K, * TA,) and a beast; (Mgh, TA;) and in like<br>\
manner ↓ ارتبط he tied, or bound, a beast with a<br>\
rope, in order that he might not run away. (TA.)<br>\
You say, كَذَا رَأْسًا مِنَ الدَّوَابِّ ↓ فُلَانٌ يَرْتَبِطُ [Such<br>\
a one ties so many head of beasts: or the verb<br>\
may here have a different signification, explained<br>\
below]. (S, TA.) And it is said in a prov.,<br>\
اِسْتَكْرَمْتَ فَارْبِطْ, or, accord. to one relation, أَكْرَمْتَ,<br>\
i. e. Thou hast found a generous horse, therefore<br>\
do thou preserve him; or, as some relate it,<br>\
↓ فَارْتَبِطْ: relating to the duty of preservation.<br>\
(TA.) See also 3. ―<br>\
-b2-  رَبَطَ عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He held back,<br>\
or drew back, from him, or it; as though he<br>\
confined, and bound, himself. (TA, from a trad.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  رَبَطَ جَأْشُهُ, inf. n. رِبَاطَةٌ, (assumed tropical:)  His heart became<br>\
strong, and firm, and resolute, (K, * TA,) so that<br>\
he did not flee on the occasion of fear. (TA.<br>\
[In the CK, رَبَطَ جَأْشَهُ, which would be more<br>\
properly rendered (tropical:)  He strengthened, or fortified,<br>\
his heart.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  رَبَطَ لِذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ جَأْشًا (tropical:)  He constrained himself to be patient, and confined, or<br>\
restricted, himself to that thing, or affair. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  رَبَطَ اللّٰهُ عَلَى قَلْبِهِ (Msb, K) بِالصَّبْرِ (Msb)<br>\
(tropical:)  God inspired him with patience. (Msb, K.)<br>\
Thus in the Kur [xviii. 13], وَرَبَطْنَا عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ<br>\
(tropical:)  And we inspired them with patience: (TA:)<br>\
or strengthened them with patience. (Bd.) And<br>\

3<br>\
المُرَابَطَةُ signifies, (K, TA,) in its primary<br>\
acceptation, (TA,) Two [hostile] parties&#39; tying<br>\
of their horses, each at their frontier, and each<br>\
in preparation for the other: (K, TA:) and<br>\
رِبَاطُ الخَيْلِ and مُرَابَطَتُهَا signify the same [as<br>\
above]. (S, TA.) [You say, رَابَطَ الفَرِيقَانِ The<br>\
two parties tied their horses at their respective<br>\
frontiers, each in preparation for the other.]<br>\
And one says, with reference to horses, ↓ رَبَطَ,<br>\
inf. n. رَبْطٌ and رِبَاطٌ, as well as رابط, inf. n. مُرَابَطَةٌ<br>\
and رِبَاطٌ. (Bd in viii. 62.) Hence, (Sgh, L, K,)<br>\
رابط, (Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. رِبَاطٌ (S, Mgh, Sgh, L,<br>\
K) and مُرَابَطَةٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) He, or it,<br>\
(an army, Mgh) kept post, or remained, on, or at,<br>\
the frontier (S, Mgh, Sgh, L, K) of the enemy,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) or over against the enemy. (Mgh.)<br>\
And hence, i. e. from this latter application,<br>\
(AAF, TA,) رابط الأَمْرَ, (TK,) inf. n. رِبَاطٌ (AAF,<br>\
K) and مُرَابَطَةٌ, (TK,) (assumed tropical:)  He kept, or applied himself, constantly, perseveringly, or assiduously, to<br>\
the thing, or affair. (AAF, K, TK.) It is said<br>\
in the Kur [ch. iii., last verse], اصْبِرُوا وَصَابِرُوا<br>\
وَرَابِطُوا Be ye patient in endurance of what your<br>\
religion requires, and vie ye in patience with<br>\
your enemy, and persevere ye in fighting against<br>\
your enemy, (Mgh, TA,) and in tying the horses<br>\
[at the frontier]: (TA:) or the last of these<br>\
verbs means keep ye post, or remain ye, on, or at,<br>\
the frontier [of the enemy]: (Az, K:) or (assumed tropical:)  be ye<br>\
mindful of the times of prayer: or (assumed tropical:)  apply yourselves constantly, perseveringly, or assiduously, to<br>\
prayer: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  wait ye for prayer after<br>\
prayer; the doing this being termed by the Prophet رِبَاطٌ; (Az, K, TA;) which word, thus used,<br>\
is an inf. n. of رَابَطْتُ; or, as some say, a simple<br>\
subst., meaning, in this case, a thing whereby one<br>\
is tied from acts of disobedience, and restrained<br>\
from forbidden deeds. (TA.) [See also صَابَرَ.]<br>\
6<br>\
ترابط المَآءُ فِى مَكَانِ كَذَا وَكَذَا (tropical:)  The water<br>\
remained in, or did not quit, or go forth from,<br>\
such and such a place. (TA.)<br>\

-b2-  ارتبط فَرَسًا He<br>\
took a horse for the purpose of tying him, or<br>\
keeping post, on the enemy&#39;s frontier. (K, * TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [He, or it, became tied, bound, or made fast.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  ارتبط فِى الحَبْلِ He became caught, or entangled, in the rope. (Lh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اِرْتِبَاطٌ is also explained by AO and Ez-Zejjájee as syn. with<br>\
اعْتلَاقٌ. (TA.) [Thus, ارتبطهُ signifies He, or it,<br>\
attached himself, or itself, or clung, or clave, to<br>\
him, or it: (see a citation from Lebeed, voce<br>\
بَعْضٌ:) and app. also (assumed tropical:)  he loved him.]<br>\
رِبَاطٌ A thing with which one ties, binds, or<br>\
makes fast, (S, Msb, K,) a skin, (S, Msb,) and a<br>\
beast, (S,) &amp;c.; (S, Msb;) a rope with which a<br>\
beast is tied: (Mgh:) pl. رُبُطٌ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
رُبْطٌ; (S, TA;) the latter a contraction of the<br>\
former: (TA:) and ↓ مِرْبَطٌ and ↓ مِرْبَطَةٌ also<br>\
signify a thing with which a beast is tied. (K.)<br>\
It is said in a prov., إِنْ ذَهَبَ عَيْرٌ فَعَيْرٌ فِى الرِّبَاطِ<br>\
[If an ass is gone away, an ass is tied to the<br>\
cord]: relating to contentment with what is present and relinquishment of what is absent. (Mgh.)<br>\
[See also 3.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] used by the vulgar in<br>\
the sense of أُخْذَةٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  A kind of fascination by which enchantresses withhold their husbands<br>\
from other women. (TA in art. اخذ.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A<br>\
snare for catching game. (S, Mgh.) You say,<br>\

(S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  The heart: (K:) as though the body<br>\
were tied thereby. (TA.) Hence, (TA in art.<br>\
قرض,) قَرَضَ ربَاطَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He died: (M and K in that<br>\
art.:) or he was at the point of death. (K in that<br>\
art.) And جَآءَ فُلَانٌ وَقَدْ قَرَضَ رِبَاطَهُ (tropical:)  Such a one<br>\
came having turned away, or back, harassed, distressed, or fatigued, (S, TA, and AZ and Az in<br>\
art. قرض,) and at the point of death: (AZ, Az:)<br>\
or harassed, or distressed, by thirst, or by fatigue:<br>\
(A in art. قرض:) or in a state of intense thirst<br>\
and hunger. (M in that art.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  The spirit:<br>\
as in the saying of El-&#39;Ajjáj, describing a wild<br>\
bull,<br>\
فَبَاتَ وَهْوَ ثَابِتُ الرِّبَاطِ<br>\

-A2-  See also رَبِيطٌ, (of which it is a pl., or pl. pl.,)<br>\
in three places.<br>\
-A3-  A single building of those<br>\
which are called رِبَاطَاتٌ: (S, K:) [a public<br>\
building for the accommodation of travellers and<br>\
their beasts; (see بَرِيدٌ;) an application well<br>\
known, and mentioned in the TK:] a religious<br>\
house, or house inhabited by devotees; a dwelling for Soofees; (El-Makreezee&#39;s “ Khitat ”<br>\
ii. 427;) [a hospice, or an asylum for poor<br>\
Muslim students and others, like زَاوِيَةٌ;] a building for the poor: in this sense post-classical: pl.,<br>\
accord. to analogy, رُبُطٌ and رِبَاطَاتٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
رَبِيطٌ Tied, bound, or made fast; as also ↓ مَرْبُوطٌ;<br>\
(K, TA;) applied to a horse, (Mgh,) or similar<br>\
beast (دَابَّة); as also ↓ مَرْبُوطَةٌ; (TA;) applied to<br>\
the former, i. q. مَرْبُوطٌ; (Mgh;) or مَايُرْتَبَطُ<br>\
[which may perhaps signify the same; but more<br>\
probably, taken to be tied, or for keeping post, on<br>\
the enemy&#39;s frontier]; (S;) and [in like manner]<br>\
رَبِيطَةٌ, applied to the latter, i. q. مَاارْتُبِطَ: (K:)<br>\
and رَبِيطٌ applied to a horse also signifies tied and<br>\
fed in the court of a house: (TA:) pl. رُبُطٌ<br>\
(TA) and ↓ رِبَاطٌ, (Mgh,) or the latter is a pl. pl.,<br>\
being pl. of رُبُطٌ. (TA.) الخَيْلِ ↓ مِنْ رِبَاطِ, in the<br>\
Kur [viii. 62], means Of horses that are tied;<br>\
(Bd, Mgh;) رِبَاطٌ being of the measure فِعَالٌ in<br>\
the sense of the measure مَفْعولٌ; or an inf. n.<br>\
used as a subst., being an inf. n. of رَبَطَ in the<br>\
sense of رَابَطَ; (Bd;) or it is an inf. n. of رَابَطَ;<br>\
and therefore [when used as an epithet, like any<br>\
inf. n. so used,] is applied to one as well as to a<br>\
pl. number; (Ham p. 222;) or pl. of رَبِيطْ:<br>\
(Bd, Mgh:) or it means of mares: (Fr, TA:)<br>\
and رِبَاطٌ signifies horses; five thereof, and upwards: (S, K:) or horses, themselves, that are<br>\
taken to be tied, or for keeping post, on the<br>\
enemy&#39;s frontier. (L.) And you say, لِفُلَانٍ<br>\
مِنَ الخَيْلِ ↓ رِبَاطٌ Such a one has a stud constituting the source of his horses; like as you say<br>\
تلَادٌ. (S.) ↓ رَابطَةٌ, also, applied to horses, signifies Tied in a town or country or the like: occuring in a trad., in which it is said that upon every<br>\
horse shall be levied a deenár; but upon the<br>\
رابطة, nothing: properly meaning, in this case,<br>\
ذَاتُ الرَّبْطِ; being like رَاضِيَةٌ in the phrase عِيشَةٌ<br>\
رَاضِيَةٌ. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also رَابِطٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, and<br>\
↓ رَابِطٌ, (assumed tropical:)  A monk: one who abstains from worldly<br>\
pleasures: a sage who restrains himself from<br>\
worldly things. (K, TA.) [In the L and TA,<br>\
الرَّبِيطُ is also explained, as on the authority of<br>\
Ez-Zejjájee, as signifying الذَّاهِبُ; but this I<br>\
think a mistranscription, for الرَّاهِبُ.]<br>\
-A2-  (assumed tropical:)  Unripe dates soaked [in water]: (S, K:) or (assumed tropical:)  fresh<br>\
ripe dates soaked with water; also called مَنْقُوشٌ:<br>\
(Sgh, TA in art. نقش:) or (tropical:)  dried dates (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
IF, A, K) put into jars (جِرَار), (A &#39;Obeyd, A,)<br>\
and having water poured upon them, (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
IF, K,) or moistened with water, in order that<br>\
they may become like fresh ripe dates: (A:) but<br>\
perhaps this is an adventitious term: (IF:) some<br>\
say that it is رَبِيدٌ, and not original. (TA.)<br>\
رَبَّاطٌ One who ties bow-strings. (TA.)<br>\
رَابِطٌ [act. part. n. of 1]. ―<br>\
-b2-  خَلَّفَ فُلَانٌ بِالثَّغْرِ<br>\
جَيْشًا رَابِطَةً [Such a one left behind him on the<br>\
frontier an army having their horses tied in<br>\
preparation for the enemy; or keeping post].<br>\
(S.) And بِبَلَدِ كَذَا رَابِطَةٌ مِنَ الخَيْلِ [In such a<br>\
town, or country, or the like, is a company of<br>\
horsemen having their horses tied at the frontier<br>\
in preparation for the enemy; or keeping post on<br>\
the frontier: or it may perhaps mean, a number<br>\
of horses tied: see رَبِيطٌ]. (S.) ↓ مُرَابِطَةٌ also<br>\
signifies A company of warriors; or of men<br>\
warring against an enemy: (Mgh:) or a company of men having their horses tied at the<br>\

and consequently not doomed, but] having ample<br>\
power, or liberty, [and] capable of good; syn.<br>\
وَاسِعٌ أَرِيضٌ. (K.) An Arab is related by IAar<br>\
to have said, اَللّٰهُمَّ اغْفِرْلِى وَالجِلْدُ بَارِدٌ وَالنَّفْسُ<br>\
رَابِطٌ وَالصُّحُفُ مُنْتَشِرَةٌ وَالتَّوْبَةُ مَقْبُولَةٌ [O God, forgive me while the skin is cool, not heated by<br>\
fever, and the spirit is yet attached to my body,<br>\
and is at liberty, and capable of good, and the<br>\
volumes in which my actions are registered are<br>\
still expanded, and repentance is accepted]: he<br>\
meant thereby, while he was in health; before<br>\
death. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also رَبِيطٌ, in two places.<br>\
رَابِطَةٌ [fem. of رَابِطٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also] A tie, or connection, of any kind; syn. عُلْقَةٌ [q. v.] and وُصْلَةٌ.<br>\
(TA.) [This meaning of رابطة is well known,<br>\
though omitted in the S and K &amp;c. ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The copula in a proposition.]<br>\
مَرْبِطٌ (S, Mgh, K) and مَرْبَطٌ, (S K,) the former<br>\
used by him who says أَرْبُطُ, and the latter by him<br>\
who says أَرْبُطُ, (IB,) The place where a thing,<br>\
(S,) or where a beast, (Mgh, K,) is tied, bound,<br>\

(Har p. 33.) You say, لَيْسَ لَهُ مَرْبَِطُ عَنْزٍ [He has<br>\
not so much as, or even, a place where a she-goat is tied]. (S.) Each is a noun of place used<br>\
in a definite manner; so that you may not say,<br>\
هُوَ مِنِّى مَرْبَطَ الفَرَسِ, like مَنَاطَ الثُّرَيَّا. (TA: [in<br>\
which, however, the word مناط has been inadvertently omitted.]) ―<br>\
