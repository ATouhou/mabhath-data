رَمَى الشَّىْءَ, (T, * S, M, K,) aor. يَرْمِى, (T,)<br>\
inf. n. رَمْىٌ; (T, M;) and رَمَى بِهِ; (M, K;) He<br>\
threw, cast, or flung, the thing, (S, K,) مِنْ يَدِهِ<br>\
from his hand; (S, TA;) as also ↓ ارمى; (M,<br>\
K;) i. e. ارمى الشَّىْءَ مِنْ يَدِهِ: (M: [in the K it<br>\
is implied that one says also بَهِ ↓ ارمى; agreeably<br>\
with a phrase mentioned in what follows:]) you<br>\
say, الحَجَرَ مِنْ يَدِى ↓ أَرْمَيْتُ I threw the stone<br>\
from my hand: (S:) and الفَرَسُ بِرَاكِبِهِ ↓ ارمى<br>\
The horse threw, or threw down, [i. e. threw off,]<br>\
his rider: (T:) رَمَيْتُ الرَّجُلَ is said إِذَا رَمَيْتَهُ بِيَدِكَ;<br>\
[i. e., as meaning رَمَيْتُهُ بِيَدِى; which may be<br>\
rendered I threw him (the man) with my hand;<br>\
and also I threw, or shot, at him (the man) with<br>\
my hand;] but when you remove him from his<br>\
place, you say, عَنِ الفَرَسِ وَغَيْرِهِ ↓ أَرْمَيْتُهُ [I threw<br>\
him, or threw him down or off, from the horse<br>\
&amp;c.]: (Msb:) and عَنْ فَرَسِهِ ↓ طَعَنَهُ فَأَرْمَاهُ, meaning [He thrust him, or pierced him, with his<br>\
spear,] and threw him, or threw him down [or<br>\
off], from his horse: (El-Fárábee, S, Msb:) and<br>\
الحِمْلَ عَنْ ظَهْرِ البَعِيرِ ↓ أَرْمَيْتُ I threw down the<br>\
load from the back of the camel. (T.) وَمَا رَمَيْتَ<br>\
إِذْ رَمَيْتَ وَلٰكِنَّ اللّٰهَ رَمَى, in the Kur [viii. 17], is<br>\
said by Aboo-Is-hák to be tropical, and to mean<br>\
(tropical:)  And thou didst not cast [in effect, or] so as to<br>\
attain the point that was attained, [when thou<br>\
didst cast,] but God [cast in effect, i. e.,] overruled the casting: or, accord. to Abu-l-&#39; Abbás,<br>\
the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  thou didst not cast fear, or<br>\
terror, into their hearts, when thou didst cast the<br>\
pebbles, [but God cast the fear, or terror:] or,<br>\
accord. to Mbr, (assumed tropical:)  thou didst not cast with thy<br>\
strength, when thou didst cast, but with the<br>\
strength of God thou didst cast [so that in effect<br>\
God cast]. (T. [See also another explanation in<br>\
what follows.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [رَمَى بِسَلْحِهِ He cast forth his<br>\
excrement, or ordure, or properly, in a thin state,<br>\
is a phrase of frequent occurrence.] ―<br>\
-b3-  You say<br>\
also, رَمَيْتُ بِالسَّهْمِ [I shot the arrow], inf. n. رَمْىٌ<br>\
and رِمَايَةٌ. (S.) And رَمَى عَنِ القَوْسِ, (S, M, Msb,)<br>\
or رَمَى السَّهْمَ عَن القَوْسِ, (Mgh, * K,) and عَلَيْهَا,<br>\
(S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. رَمْىٌ (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K) and رِمَايَةٌ, (Mgh, K,) [He shot, or shot the<br>\
arrow, from, and upon, meaning with, the bow;]<br>\
and accord. to El-Ghooree, بِهَا also; (Mgh;) but<br>\
one should not say رَمَى بِهَا, (S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
unless meaning “ he threw it from his hand; ”<br>\
though some make it to mean [رَمَى عَنْهَا or] رَمَى<br>\
عَلَيْهَا, making the ب to be instead of عن or على.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And رَمَى القَنَصَ, (S, M,) or الصَّيْدَ,<br>\
[He shot, or shot at, the animal, or animals, of<br>\
the chase,] inf. n. رَمْىٌ and رِمَايَةٌ, (Msb,) or رَمْىٌ,<br>\
and none other. (M.) [And رَمَاهُ بِكَذَا He threw<br>\
at him, cast at him, or shot at him, with such a<br>\
thing; i. e. he threw it, cast it, or shot it, at him:<br>\
and, more commonly, he threw at him, or cast at<br>\
him, and hit him, or he shot him, with such a<br>\
thing: namely, with a stone, an arrow, &amp;c. And<br>\
رَمَاهُ بِحِجَارَةً He threw at him with stones, threw<br>\
stones at him: and he pelted him with stones, i. e.<br>\
threw at him and hit him with stones.] And<br>\
رَمَى فِى الأَغْرَاضِ [He shot, or cast, at the butts].<br>\
(ISk, T, S, M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence,] one says, in cursing<br>\
a person, رَمَى اللّٰهُ فِى يَدِهِ, and أَنْفِهِ, (assumed tropical:)  [May God<br>\
aim at, and smite, with some bane, or malady,<br>\
his hand, or arm, and his nose,] and in like<br>\
manner in relation to other members. (M, K. *)<br>\
[And رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ بِكَذَا, sometimes meaning (assumed tropical:)  God<br>\
smote him, or afflicted him, with such a thing:<br>\
but generally, may God smite him, or afflict him,<br>\
with such a thing; as in the saying,] رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ<br>\
بِدَآءِ الذِّئْبِ (assumed tropical:)  [May God smite him, or afflict him,<br>\
with the disease of the wolf]; a prov., meaning<br>\
may God destroy him, or cause him to perish;<br>\
because [it is said that] the wolf has no disease<br>\
but death: or, as some say, the meaning is, رَمَاهُ<br>\
اللّٰهُ بِالجُوعِ [may God afflict him with hunger];<br>\
because the wolf is always hungry. (Meyd.) And<br>\
رَمَاهُ بِدَاهِيَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [He (God) sent upon him, or against<br>\
him,. or smote him with, a calamity: and also]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  he (a man) made a very sagacious and crafty<br>\
and politic man to be his assailant. (L in art.<br>\
حجر. [See also, in that art., رُمِىَ فُلَانٌ بِحَجِرِ<br>\
الأَرْضِ, and بِحَجَرِهِ.]) [And رَمَاهُ بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He assailed him with such a thing; as, for instance,<br>\
reproach, and an argument, &amp;c. Hence,] رَمَاهُ<br>\
بِقَبِيحٍ, (TA,) or بِأَمْرٍ قَبِيحٍ, (IAar, T,) or بِالقَبِيحِ,<br>\
(Msb,) (assumed tropical:)  He reproached him, or upbraided him,<br>\
with a thing, or with that, which was bad, evil,<br>\
abominable, or foul: (IAar, T, Msb, TA:) whence<br>\
the usage of the verb alone [in this sense, adultery<br>\
being understood,] in the Kur xxiv. 4 and 6. (T,<br>\
TA.) [And رَمَاهُ بِسُوْءٍ (assumed tropical:)  He cast an evil imputation upon him; accused him, or suspected him, of<br>\
evil: see مَرْمِىٌّ. And رَمَاهُ alone (assumed tropical:)  He accused<br>\
him, or suspected him.] And رَمَاهُ بِالحَقِّ (assumed tropical:)  [He<br>\
accused him with truth]. (L in art. قرح, in<br>\
explanation of قَرَحَهُ بِالحَقِّ.) [And رَمَاهُ بِلِسَانِهِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He spoke against him.] ―<br>\
-b6-  رَمَى اللّٰهُ لَكَ means<br>\
(tropical:)  May God aid thee, or aid thee against thine<br>\
enemy, and work [good] for thee: (AO, S, TA: *)<br>\
and رَمَى اللّٰهُ لَهُ (tropical:)  God aided him, or aided him<br>\
against his enemy, (AAF, M, K, TA,) and<br>\
wrought [good] for him: (AAF, M, TA:) and<br>\
[it is said that] the verb has this meaning in the<br>\
words of the Kur, وَمَا رَمَيْتَ إِذْ رَمَيْتَ وَلٰكِنَّ اللّٰهَ رَمَى<br>\
[of which other explanations have been given<br>\
above]; because, when God aids a person against<br>\
his enemy, He aims at, and smites, (يَرْمِى,) that<br>\
enemy. (M, TA.) [In like manner, also, فُلَانٌ<br>\
يَرْمِى مِنْ وَرَآءِ فُلَانٍ means (assumed tropical:)  Such a one defends<br>\
such a one.] ―<br>\
-b7-  رُمِيتُ بِكَذَا (tropical:)  I had such a thing<br>\
offered, or presented, to me, the meeting with it<br>\
being appointed, or prepared; [I had it as it<br>\
were thrown to me, or thrown in my way; as<br>\
though I were thrown at therewith;] like نُبِذْتُ بِهِ.<br>\
(A in art. نبذ.) ―<br>\
-b8-  رَمَانِى القَوْمُ بِأَبْصَارِهِمْ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
people, or party, [cast their eyes, on me: or]<br>\
looked at me sideways, or did so with anger, or<br>\
aversion: or looked at me hardly, or intently.<br>\
(Mgh.) [And رَمَى بِبَصَرِهِ الأَرْضَ (assumed tropical:)  He cast his<br>\
eyes on the ground.] ―<br>\
-b9-  رَمَى بِالقَوْمِ (assumed tropical:)  He, or it,<br>\
caused, or made, the people, or party, to go forth;<br>\
expelled them; [or cast them forth;] from one<br>\
country, or the like, to another. (M, TA.) [See<br>\
also 6.]) [And رَمَى بِنَاقَتِهِ الفَلَاةَ (assumed tropical:)  He urged forth<br>\
his she-camel, or went forth with her, or journeyed<br>\
with her, or directed his course with her, into the<br>\
desert; agreeably with what precedes or with<br>\
what follows.] رَمْىٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The going<br>\
forth from one country, or the like, to another.<br>\
(Th, M, TA.) And رَمَى الرَّجُلُ (assumed tropical:)  The man journeyed. (IAar, T, TA.) And Az says, (TA,) I<br>\
heard an Arab of the desert say to another, أَيْنَ<br>\
تَرْمِى, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Whither dost thou direct thy<br>\
course. (T, TA.) One says, رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا يَرْمُونَ<br>\
الطَّائِفَ (assumed tropical:)  I saw men directing their course to, or<br>\
towards, Et-Táïf. (Har p. 54.) [See also an ex.<br>\
in a verse of Dhu-r-Rummeh cited in p. 78.] ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
رَمَوْهَا بِأَثْوَابٍ خِفَافٍ, in a verse cited voce ثَوْبٌ,<br>\
[They cast upon them light, or agile, bodies,]<br>\
means they mounted them with their [light, or<br>\
agile,] bodies; referring to camels. (T and TA<br>\
in art. ثوب.) ―<br>\
-b11-  رُمِىَ فِى جِنَازَتِهِ He has been<br>\
carried, or lifted, and put, into, or upon, his bier,<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  he died, or has died: (TA:) it is said in<br>\
giving information of a man&#39;s death. (TA in art.<br>\
جنز.) ―<br>\
-b12-  [رَمَى also app. means (assumed tropical:)  He (a governor)<br>\
imposed an impost upon his subjects: see رَمِيَّةٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b13-  And رَمَى, aor. يَرْمِى, means also (assumed tropical:)  He misconjectured; thought wrongly; or formed a wrong<br>\
opinion: (IAar, T:) [and app. he threw out a<br>\
conjecture: or he spoke conjecturally; for Az<br>\
adds,] it is like the phrase رَجْمًا بِالغَيْبِ [or رَجَمَ<br>\
بِالغَيْبِ or قَالَ رَجْمًا بِالغَيْبِ]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b14-  رَمَى السَّحَابُ:<br>\
see 6. ―<br>\
-b15-  رَمَى عَلَى الخَمْسِينَ: see 4.<br>\
-A2-  رَمُوَ is a<br>\
verb of the same kind as قَضُوَ and هَيُؤَ, [invariable<br>\
as to person, time, and mood,] and means Excel-lent [or how excellent] is he in his throwing, or<br>\
shooting! (IJ, TA voce هَيُؤَ, q. v. [See also بَطُؤَ,<br>\
voce بُطْآنَ.])<br>\
3<br>\
رَامَيْتُهُ, (S, K,) and رَامَيْتُهُ بِالسِّهَامِ, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. مُرَامَاةٌ and رِمَآءٌ (T, S, K) and ↓ تَرْمَآءٌ, (K,)<br>\
or this last is like the two preceding ns. [in meaning, but is a quasi-inf. n.], (T,) [I threw, or shot,<br>\
(generally the latter,) and I shot arrows, with<br>\
him, or at him; (see 6;) mostly meaning in<br>\
competition, or contention; i. e. I competed, or<br>\
contended, with him, in throwing, or shooting,<br>\
and in shooting arrows: and رَامَيْتُهُ alone often<br>\
means رَامَيْتُهُ بِالحِجَارَةِ, or بِالسِّهَامِ; whence it is<br>\
said that] مُرَامَاةٌ signifies the shooting arrows,<br>\
and throwing stones, with any one. (KL.) It is<br>\
said in a prove., respecting an affair in which one<br>\
is forward before doing it,<br>\
قَبْلَ الرِّمَآءِ تُمْلَأُ الكَنَائِنُ<br>\
[Before shooting arrows with another, or doing<br>\
so in competition or contention, the quivers are to<br>\
be filled]. (A &#39;Obeyd, T.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَرْمَىَ see 1, first sentence, in seven places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and<br>\
see also 6.<br>\
-A2-  ارمى, (M, Mgh,) inf. n. إِرْمَآءٌ,<br>\
(Mgh,) also signifies It (a thing, Mgh) exceeded.<br>\
(M, Mgh.) You say, ارمى عَلَيْهِ It (anything)<br>\
exceeded it, namely, another thing. (M.) Hátim-<br>\
Teiyi says,<br>\
وَأَسْمَرَ خَطِّيًّا كَأَنَّ كُعُوبَهُ<br>\
نَوَى القَسْبِ قَدْ أَرْمَى ذِرَاعًا عَلَى العَشْرِ<br>\
[And a tawny spear of El-Khatt, as though its<br>\
knots, or joints, were hard date-stones; one that<br>\
exceeded a cubit over the ten]: (T, S:) i. e.,<br>\
قَدْ زَادَ عَلَيْهَا. (T.) And hence, (T,) you say,<br>\
ارمى عَلَى الخَمْسِينَ, i. e. He exceeded [the age of<br>\
fifty]; (AZ, A &#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, K;) [like اربى;]<br>\
as also ↓ رَمَى; (AZ, T, S, M, K;) [for] رَمْىٌ signifies the exceeding in age: and one says also<br>\
أَرْمَأَ and رَمَأَ in the same sense. (IAar, T.) And<br>\
ارمى فُلَانٌ signifies the same as أَرْبَى [meaning<br>\
Such a one took usury or the like]. (S.) See also<br>\
رَمَآءٌ, below. You say also, سَابَّهُ فَأَرْمَى عَلَيْهِ, i. e.<br>\
[He reciprocated reviling, or vilifying, with him,<br>\
and] he exceeded him. (S.)<br>\
5<br>\
ترمّى He shot, or cast, at the butts, and at<br>\
the trunks of trees. (ISk, T, S, M.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَرَامَيْنَا and ↓ اِرْتَمَيْنَا [We cast, or shot, (generally the latter,) one with another, or one at<br>\
another; mostly meaning in competition, or contention; i. e. we competed, or contended, together<br>\
in throwing, or shooting]: (S, K:) and ترامى القَوْمُ<br>\
بِالسِّهَامِ and ↓ ارتموا The people, or party, shot<br>\
arrows, [one with another, or] one at another.<br>\
(T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ترامت بِهِ البِلَادُ (tropical:)  The countries<br>\
cast him forth, or expelled him; (M, K, TA;)<br>\
[as though they bandied him, one to another;] as<br>\
also ↓ ارتمت, (so in a copy of the M, [which I<br>\
think correct,]) or ↓ ارمت. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And ترامى<br>\
السَّحَابُ (assumed tropical:)  The clouds became drawn, or joined,<br>\
together, (M, K, TA,) [as though thrown, one at<br>\
another,] and heaped, or piled, up; (TA;) as<br>\
also ↓ رَمَى. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And ترامى أَمْرُهُ إِلَى<br>\
الظَّفَرِ; or إِلَى الخِذْلَانِ; i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [His affair, or<br>\
case,] came eventually [to the attainment of what<br>\
was desired, or sought; or to abandonment by<br>\
God]. (T, K, TA.) Hence, (TA,) it is said in a<br>\
trad., of Zeyd Ibn-Háritheh, سُبِىَ فِى الجَاهِلِيَّةِ<br>\
فَتَرَامَى الأَمْرُ أَنْ صَارَلِخَدِيجَةَ, (T, TA,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [He<br>\
was made a captive in the Time of Ignorance,<br>\
and the case] came eventually, and led, [to his<br>\
becoming the property of Khadeejeh, (إِلَى being<br>\
understood before أَنْ صَارَ,)] as though the decrees<br>\
[of God] cast him thereto. (IAth, TA.) One<br>\
says also, ترامى الأَمْرُ, meaning تَرَاخَى [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
affair was sluggish, or backward]: (K:) [or]<br>\
one says of a [purulent swelling such as is termed]<br>\
حِيْن, (T,) or of a wound, (S,) ترامى إِلَى فَسَادٍ,<br>\
(T,) or الى الفَسَادِ, (S,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  It was in a sluggish,<br>\
or backward, state, (تَرَاخَى,) and became putrid<br>\
and corrupt. (T.) And ترامى إِلَيْهِ الخَبَرُ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
news, or information, came to him; or came to<br>\
him by degrees. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  ترامت سَفْرَتُهُ (assumed tropical:)  His<br>\
journey was, or became, distant, or far-extending.<br>\
(Har p. 34.) ―<br>\
-b6-  تراماهُ الشَّبَابُ Youthfulness, or<br>\
youthful vigour, attained its full term [in him].<br>\
(Skr, M.)<br>\
8<br>\
ارتمى It was, or became, thrown, cast, or<br>\
flung. (S, K, TA.) It fell to the ground: so in<br>\
the saying, ارتمى الحِمْلُ عَنْ ظَهْرِ البَعِيرِ [The load<br>\
fell to the ground, or it may mean was thrown<br>\
down, from the back of the camel]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
He shot, or shot at, an animal, or animals, of the<br>\
chase. (T, S, M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 6, in three places.<br>\
رَمْىٌ [originally an inf. n.]: see رَمِىٌّ.<br>\
رِمًى The sound of a stone (T, K) thrown at a<br>\
boy (so accord. to a copy of the T) or thrown by<br>\
a boy; (K;) on the authority of IAar. (T.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
رِمًا [thus written in the M]: see رَمَآءٌ.<br>\
رَمْيَةٌ A single throw, or cast, or fling: and a<br>\
single shot: (Mgh, Msb, TA:) pl. رَمَيَاتٌ. (Msb,<br>\
TA.) رُبَّ رَمْيَةٍ مِنْ غَيْرِ رَامٍ [Many a hitting shot,<br>\
or scarce any hitting shot, is there without a<br>\
skilled shooter] is a prov. [applied to the case of<br>\
an unexpected success obtained by an inexperienced<br>\
person;] meaning many a [hitting] shot, or scarce<br>\
any [hitting] shot, originates from a shooter that<br>\
[usually] misses. (Meyd)<br>\
رَمَآءٌ, (S, IAth, K, in a copy of the T and in a<br>\
copy of the S without any vowel-sign,) with<br>\
fet-h and medd, (IAth, and so in a copy of the S,<br>\
in which it is added that it is said by Ks to be<br>\
with medd,) like سَمَآءٌ; (K;) or ↓ رِمَآءٌ; (Mgh,<br>\
and so in a copy of the T;) or ↓ رِمًا, said by Lh<br>\
to be formed by substitution [of م for ب, as is<br>\
shown by what follows]; (M;) An excess, or an<br>\
addition; i. e., (A &#39;Obeyd, T, Mgh,) i. q. رِبًا,<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, K,) or رِبًوا, (Mgh, and thus<br>\
written in some copies of the S and K, or in<br>\
most of the copies of the K, [meaning usury, and<br>\
the like,]) or an excess, or addition, over what is<br>\
lawful. (T, IAth.) Hence the trad. of &#39;Omar,<br>\
لَا تَبِيعُوا, (A &#39;Obeyd, T,) or he said لَا تَشْتَرُوا, (S,)<br>\
الذَّهَبَ بِالفِضَّةِ إِلَّا يَدًا بِيَدٍ هَا وَهَا, [or هَأْ وَهَأْ, (see<br>\
art. هوأ,)] or هَآء وَهَآء, [i. e. هَآءَ وَهَآءَ,] (accord. to<br>\
different copies of the T and S,) adding, (T, S,)<br>\
إِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمُ الرمآءَ; (T, S, Mgh;) [i. e. Exchange not ye gold for silver, except it be done<br>\
hand with hand, meaning, except there be no<br>\
delay between the giving and receiving, take and<br>\
take: verily I fear for you the practice of usury;]<br>\
or he said, إِلَّا هَآءَ وَهَآءِ, meaning, except [by saying]<br>\
take and give: (Az, TA in باب الالف الليّنة:)<br>\
and, as some relate it, he said, انّى اخاف عليكم<br>\
↓ الإرْمَآءَ; [which means the same;] using the<br>\
inf. n. (T, Mgh.)<br>\
رِمَآءٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
رَمِىٌّ, applied to the male of the goat-kind, or<br>\
mountain-goat, or of the gazelle, [and any male<br>\
animal of the chase,] and likewise, without ة, to<br>\
the female, i. q. ↓ مَرْمِىٌّ [i. e. Thrown at, or cast<br>\
at, or shot at, or shot]: but when they do not<br>\
distinguish a male from a female, the word applied to the male and to the female is [↓ رَمِيَّةٌ,]<br>\
with ة [added لِلنَّقْلِ, i. e. to transfer it from the<br>\
category of epithets to that of substantives]: or,<br>\
accord. to Lh, رَمِىٌّ and ↓ رَمِيَّةٌ are both applied,<br>\
as epithets, to the female; but the former is the<br>\
more approved: the pl. of the former [and of the<br>\
latter also] is رَمَايَا. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (M,)<br>\
accord. to As, i. q. سَقِىٌّ, i. e., (T, S,) A cloud of<br>\
which the rain-drops are large, and vehement in<br>\
their fall, (T, S, M, K, *) of the clouds of the hot<br>\
season and of the autumn: (S:) or, (M, K,)<br>\
accord. to Lth, (T,) small portions of clouds, (T,<br>\
M, K,) of the [apparent] size of the hand, or<br>\
somewhat larger; but the approved explanation<br>\
is that given by As: (T:) and ↓ رَمْىٌ is a dial. var.<br>\
thereof: (TA:) the pl. is أَرْمِيَةٌ, (T, S, M, K,) like<br>\
as that of سَقِىٌّ is أَسْقِيَةٌ, (S,) and أَرْمآءٌ, (Lth, T,<br>\
M, K,) [each, properly, a pl. of pauc.,] and رَمَايَا.<br>\
(M, K.)<br>\
رَمِيَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\
places. [As a subst.,] it signifies A thing, (S, M,)<br>\
meaning (S) an animal (As, T, S, M, * Mgh, Msb)<br>\
of the chase, (As, T, S,) that is thrown at, or cast<br>\
at, or shot at, or shot, (As, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
by its pursuer; and any beast thrown at, cast at,<br>\
shot at, or shot; (As, T;) applied to the male and<br>\
the female: (As, T, Mgh, Msb:) it is originally a<br>\
word of the measure فَعِلَيةٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولَةٌ: (Msb:) [or rather] it is made<br>\
fem., (As, T,) [i. e.] it has ة, (S,) because it is<br>\
made a subst., (As, T, S,) not an epithet: (As, T:)<br>\
it is not مَرْمِيَّةٌ converted into رَمِيَّةٌ: (S:) or, accord.<br>\
to Sb, the ة, in general, is affixed to show that<br>\
the act has not yet been executed upon the object<br>\
thereof; [so that the meaning is, an animal to be<br>\
thrown at, cast at, shot at, or shot;] and thus<br>\
ذَبِيحَةٌ is applied to “ a sheep, or goat, [to be<br>\
slaughtered or sacrificed,] not yet slaughtered [or<br>\
sacrificed]; ” but when the act has been executed<br>\
upon it, it is [said to be] ذَبِيحٌ: (M:) the pl. is<br>\
رَمِيَّاتٌ and رَمَايَا. (Msb.) One says, بِئْسَ الرَّمِيَّةُ<br>\
الأَرْنَبُ, meaning Very bad is the thing of those<br>\
that are [or are to be] thrown at, or cast at, or shot<br>\
at, or shot, the hare. (S, M.) ―<br>\

M, رِمِّيَا;] i. q. تَرَامٍ: (T, S: *) or مُرَامَاةٌ: (K:) or<br>\
رَمْىٌ: (M:) or it is an intensive inf. n. from<br>\
الرَّمْىُ, of the measure فِعِّيلَى, like هِجِّيَرى and<br>\
خِصِّيصَى: (Nh, TA:) one says, كَانَتْ بَيْنَهُمْ رِمِّيَّا<br>\
(T, * S, M, * TA) ثُمَّ حَجَزَتْ بَيْنَهُمْ حِجِّيزَى, (T,)<br>\

the S, but in the TA it is IAar,] S, TA:) [and<br>\
app. a missile of any kind: (see مِرْدًى:)] pl.<br>\
مَرَامٍ. (M.) When they see many مَرَامٍ in the<br>\
quiver of a man, they say,<br>\
وَنَبْلُ العَبْدِ أَكْثَرُهَا المَرَامِى<br>\
[And the arrows of the slave, most of them are<br>\
those that are small and weak]: a prov., said to<br>\
mean that the free man purchases arrows at a<br>\
high price, buying the broad and long iron head,<br>\
because he is a man of war and of the chase; but<br>\
the slave is only a pastor, and therefore is content<br>\
with what are termed مَرَامٍ, because they are<br>\
cheaper if he buy them; and if he ask for them<br>\
as a gift, no one gives him aught but a مِرْمَاة.<br>\
(M.) [See also the last sentence of this paragraph.] ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also used, tropically, as meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  A مَنْجَنِيق [or kind of engine for casting stones<br>\
at the enemy; app. such as was called by the<br>\
Romans “ onager,” or the like thereof]: because,<br>\
like the مِرْمَاْة before mentioned, it is an instrument for casting, or shooting. (Mgh.) [See also<br>\
مِرْمًى.] And [the pl.] مَرَامٍ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  Thunderbolts; syn. صَوَاعِقُ. (Bd in xviii. 38.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\

away: (Mgh:) [or,] accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, (T, S,)<br>\
a thing that is between the two hoofs of a sheep<br>\
or goat; (T, S, M, K;) as also ↓ مَرْمَاةٌ: (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
T, M, K:) thus, he says, it is explained; but I<br>\
know not what is its meaning: (T, S:) its dual<br>\
occurs in the following trad.: لَوْ أَنَّ أَحَدَهُمْ دُعِىَ<br>\
إِلَى مِرْمَاتَيْنِ لَأَجَابَ وَهُوَ لَا يُجِيبُ إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ;<br>\
(T, S; related also, with some variations, in the<br>\
M and Mgh;) in which it is said to be the dual<br>\
of مِرْمَاةٌ in the former of these two senses; [i. e.<br>\
If any one of you were invited to partake of two<br>\
hoofs of a sheep or goat, he would obey the invitation, but he will not obey the invitation to<br>\
prayer;] (S, Mgh;) or, accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, it<br>\
is here the dual of this word in the latter of the<br>\
same two senses: (T, S:) accord. to IAar, (T,<br>\
TA,) or Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, it here means the kind of<br>\
arrow called مِرْمَاةٌ: (T, Mgh, TA:) but in another, and similar, trad., مرماتين is followed by<br>\
أَوْعَرْقٍ [i. e. “ or a bone with some meat remaining<br>\
upon it ”]. (T, Z, TA.)<br>\
