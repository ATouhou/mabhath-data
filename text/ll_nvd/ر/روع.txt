رَاعَهُ, (IAar, Az, S, Msb, K, *) aor. يَرُوعُ<br>\
(Mgh,) inf. n. رَوْعٌ (Msb, TA) and رُوعٌ and رُوُوعٌ<br>\
and رُؤُوعٌ, (IAar, TA,) [He, or it, affected his<br>\
رُوع, i. e. heart, or mind, with fright, or fear;]<br>\
fear of it (namely an affair or event) reached his<br>\
رُوع; (Az, TA;) he, or it, (a man, S, or an<br>\
affair or event, IAar, TA, or a thing, Msb,) frightened him; put him in fear; made him afraid;<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ روّعهُ, (S, Msb, K, *)<br>\
inf. n. تَرْوِيعٌ: (TA:) or its beauty and abundance<br>\
or multitude frightened him: (Lth, TA:) and<br>\
↓ the latter also, it frightened him by its abundance or multitude, or its beauty. (TA.) Hence<br>\
the saying, in a trad., إِذَا شَمِطَ لإِنْسَانُ فِى عَارِضَيْهِ<br>\
فَذٰلِكَ الرَّوْعُ, as though meaning [When the man<br>\
becomes grizzled in the hair of the two sides of<br>\
his face, that is] the warning of death. (TA.)<br>\
You say also, [using the pass. form,] رِيعَ, aor.<br>\
يُرَاعُ, (TA,) inf. n. رَوْعٌ, (S, K,) He was, or<br>\
became, frightened, or afraid; or he feared;<br>\
(S, * K, * TA;) as also ↓ ارتاع, and ↓ تروّع. (S,<br>\
K, TA.) And رَاعَ مِنْهُ, aor. يَرُوعُ, inf. n. رَوْعٌ,<br>\
He was, or became, frightened at it, or afraid of<br>\
it; or he feared it. (TK. [But I know of no<br>\
authority on which this is founded, except a<br>\
prov. (cited in art. جعر) , in which some read<br>\
رُوعِى جَعَارِ instead of رُوغِى.]) To a man, you say,<br>\
لَا تُرَعْ [Be not thou frightened;] fear not thou;<br>\
let not fear overtake thee: and to a woman,<br>\
لَا تُرَاعِى. (S, TA.) And hence the saying, in a<br>\
trad., لَنْ تُرَاعَوْا مَا رَأَيْنَا مِنْ شَىْءٍ [Ye shall not be<br>\
frightened, or afraid: we saw not, or have not<br>\
seen, anything]. (TA.) You also say, مِنْهُ ↓ ارتاع<br>\
and لَهُ He was, or became, frightened at, or<br>\
afraid of, him, or it; or he feared him, or it.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  [It affected his رُوع, i. e. heart, or<br>\
mind, with a sudden surprise; it took him by<br>\
surprise.] One says, مَا رَاعَنِى إِلَّا مَجِيؤُكَ meaning (tropical:)  [Nothing took me by surprise but thy<br>\
coming; i. e. I was surprised by thy coming; or]<br>\
I knew not save thy coming; as though he said,<br>\
nothing struck my رُوع but thy coming. (TA.)<br>\
And خَرَجْتُ وَ مَا رَاعَنِى إِلَّا فُلَانٌ لِالبَابِ (assumed tropical:)  [I went<br>\
forth, and nothing took me by surprise but such<br>\
a one at the door]; which is equivalent to saying,<br>\
and lo, such a one was at the door. (Har p. 207.)<br>\
And it is said in a trad. of I&#39;Ab, فَلَمْ يَرُعْنِى إِلَّا<br>\
رَجُلٌ آخِذٌ بِمَنْكِبِى, i. e. I knew not [save a man<br>\
taking hold of, or seizing, my shoulder-joint]; as<br>\
though he came upon him suddenly, or unexpectedly, without any previous appointment, and<br>\
without knowledge, and so that event frightened<br>\
him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [It affected his رُوع, i. e. heart,<br>\
or mind, with admiration, or pleasure;] it excited<br>\
his admiration and approval; it pleased him, or<br>\
rejoiced him; (S, Msb, K;) said of beauty [&amp;c.].<br>\
(Msb.) It is said in a trad., describing the people<br>\
of Paradise, فَيَرُوعُهُ مَا عَلَيْهِ مِنَ اللِّبَاسِ And what<br>\
is upon him, of apparel, excites his admiration<br>\
&amp;c., by its beauty. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [It (drink) cooled<br>\
it, (namely, the heart,) or allayed its thirst.] A<br>\
poet says,<br>\
سَقَتْنِى شَرْبَةً رَاعَتْ فُؤَادِى<br>\
سَقَاهَا اللّٰهُ مِنْ حَوْضِ الرَّسُولِ<br>\
[She gave me to drink a draught that cooled, or<br>\
allayed the thirst of, my heart: may God give<br>\
her to drink from the pool of the Apostle in<br>\
Paradise]. (TA.) You say also, هٰذِهِ شَرْبَةٌ رَاعَ<br>\
بِهَا فُؤَادِى [which may be rendered This is a<br>\
draught by which he has cooled, or allayed the<br>\
thirst of, my heart; and it is implied in the TA<br>\
that this is the right meaning: or it means] this<br>\
is a draught by which the thirst, or vehement<br>\
thirst, of my heart has been allayed: (so accord.<br>\
to the pointing in the copies of the K:) mentioned<br>\
by Az. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  The verb from رَوَعٌ [q. v. infrà]<br>\
is one and the same [whether trans. or intrans.;<br>\
i. e., you say رَاعَهُ, aor. يَرُوعُ, inf. n. رَوْعٌ, meaning<br>\
“He,” or “it, excited his admiration and approval,” &amp;c., as expl. above; and رَاعَ, app. with<br>\
the same aor. and inf. n., meaning He possessed<br>\
the quality of exciting admiration and approval<br>\
by his beauty and the pleasingness of his aspect,<br>\
or by his courage, &amp;c.; and in like manner,<br>\
رَاعَتْ, said of a woman]; the trans. verb [in this<br>\
case] being like the trans. [in other cases], and<br>\
the intrans. [in this case] like the intrans. [in<br>\
other cases]: but the regular form, accord. to<br>\
Az, of the [intrans.] verb hence derived is رَوِعَ,<br>\
aor. يَرْوَعُ, inf. n. رَوَعٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  رَاعَ فِى يَدِى<br>\
كَذَا: see art. ريع. ―<br>\
-b2-  And رَاعَ, aor. يَرُوعُ, and<br>\
يَرِيعُ, inf. n. of the former رُوَاعٌ, and of the latter<br>\
رَيْعٌ: see art. ريع.<br>\
2<br>\
رَوَّعَ see 1, first sentence, in two places.<br>\
5<br>\
تَرَوَّعَ see 1, in the former half of the paragraph.<br>\
8<br>\
إِرْتَوَعَ see 1, in the former half of the paragraph,<br>\
in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  ارتاع لِلْخَيْرِ i. q. ارتاح لَهُ [He<br>\
was affected by alacrity, cheerfulness, briskness,<br>\
liveliness, or sprightliness, disposing him to promptness to do good; he inclined to, and loved, doing<br>\
good]. (AZ.)<br>\
رَوْعٌ [see 1, of which it is an inf. n. ―<br>\
-b2- ] Fright,<br>\
or fear; (S, K;) as also ↓ رَوعٌ [accord. to some,<br>\
but this seems to be little known]. (TA.) Hence<br>\
the saying, أَفْرَخَ رَوْعُهُ His fright, or fear, departed. (S.) Az says, All the lexicologists whom<br>\
I have met say أَفْرَخَ رَوْعُهُ, with fet-h to the ر [in<br>\
روعه], except El-Mundhiree, who informs me<br>\
that AHeyth used to say, It is only ↓ افرخ رَوْعُكَ,<br>\
with damm. (TA.) Accord. to different relations<br>\
of a trad., you say, ↓ أَفْرَخَ رُوعُكَ, meaning Fright,<br>\
or fear, hath departed from thy heart; or may<br>\
fright, or fear, depart from thy heart; (K, TA;)<br>\
thus expl. by AHeyth; (TA;) and افرخ رَوْعُكَ,<br>\
with fet-h; or this latter, only, is the right, and<br>\
means what thou fearest hath quitted thee, and<br>\
departed from thee, and become removed; or may<br>\
what thou fearest quit thee, &amp;c.; as though it<br>\
were taken from the young bird&#39;s going forth<br>\
from the egg, (K, TA,) and the darkness&#39; becoming removed from it; thus expl. by Aboo-Ahmad<br>\
El-Hasan Ibn-&#39; Abd-Allah Ibn-Sa&#39;eed El-&#39; Askeree;<br>\
and AO says that افرخ روعك [thus in the TA,<br>\
without any syll. signs,] means let thy fright, or<br>\
fear, depart, for the case is not as thou fearest<br>\
it to be. (TA.) It is also said, in a trad. of<br>\
Mo&#39;áwiyeh, that he wrote in a letter to Ziyád,<br>\
↓ لِيُفْرِخْ رُوعُكَ, with damm; (K, TA;) but the<br>\
opinion commonly obtaining with the leading<br>\
lexicologists is, that it is with fet-h; except<br>\
AHeyth, who relates it thus, with damm; (TA;)<br>\
meaning Dismiss thou the رَوْع from thy رُوع;<br>\
(K, TA;) i. e., the fright, or fear, from thy<br>\
heart: (TA:) for you say أَفْرَخَتِ البَيْضَةُ when<br>\
the young bird quits the egg; and رَوْع is fright,<br>\
or fear, which does not depart from itself, but<br>\
from its place, which is the رُوع, with damm;<br>\
(AHeyth, K;) the رَوْع in the رُوع being like the<br>\
young bird in the egg: in like manner also one<br>\
says أَفْرَخَ فُؤَادُ الرَّجُلِ when a man&#39;s fright, or fear,<br>\
departs: but Dhu-r-Rummeh, though knowing the<br>\
meaning, has made an inversion, saying,<br>\
قَدْ أَفْرَخَتْ عَنْ رُوعِهِ الكُرَبُ<br>\
[for قَدْ أَفْرَخَ عَنِ الكُرَبِ رُوعُهُ His heart had freed<br>\
itself from griefs]. (AHeyth, TA.) AHeyth<br>\
adds, (TA,) one also says, عَنِ الأَمْرِ ↓ أَفْرِخَ رُوعَكَ,<br>\
or عَلَى الأَمْرِ, [accord. to different copies of the<br>\
K, the latter being the reading in the TA, but<br>\
the former probably the right,] meaning [Free<br>\
thy heart from the affair; i. e.] be thou tranquil,<br>\
and without fear. (K, TA.) Az observes, What<br>\
AHeyth says is clear; but I am averse from it<br>\
because of his being alone in his saying; though<br>\
sometimes later authorities correct things in which<br>\
the earlier have erred; therefore the correctness<br>\
of AHeyth may not be [absolutely] denied in<br>\
this matter, seeing that he had an ample share of<br>\
knowledge. (TA.) [See also art. فرخ, in several<br>\
places.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  War, or battle; as in the phrase,<br>\
شَهِدَ الرَّوْعَ (tropical:) [He witnessed, or was present at or<br>\
in, war, or battle]. (TA.) [See also an ex. in a<br>\
verse cited voce سَعَفٌ.]<br>\
رُوعٌ The heart: (S, Msb, K:) or the part<br>\
thereof which is the place of رَوْع, i. e. fear: (K, *<br>\
TA:) or the سَوَاد [or core, &amp;c.,] thereof: (K:)<br>\
and the mind: (S, Msb, K, * TA:) and the understanding; or intellect. (S, K.) See رَوْعٌ, in five<br>\
places. You say, وَقَعَ ذٰلِكَ فِى رُوعِى That came<br>\
into my mind. (S, Msb, * TA.) And it is said in<br>\
a trad., إِنَّ الرُّوحَ نَفَثَ فِى رُوعِى [Verily<br>\
the Trusted, or Trusty, Spirit (meaning Gabriel)<br>\
inspired into my mind, or heart]. (S.) You say<br>\
also, ثَابِ رُوعُهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He went to [app. a<br>\
mistake for from] a thing, and then returned to<br>\
it. (TA.)<br>\
رَوَعٌ The quality of exciting admiration and<br>\
approval by beauty (S, K) and pleasingness<br>\
of aspect, or by courage; (K;) the quality<br>\
denoted by the epithet أَرْوَعُ, applied to a man,<br>\
(S, K, *) and رَوْعَآءُ, applied to a woman. (S.)<br>\
[See also 1, near the end of the paragraph.]<br>\
رَوِعٌ: see رَائِعٌ; last sentence.<br>\
رَوْعَةٌ A fit of fright or fear: (S, K, TA:) pl.<br>\
رَوَعَاتٌ; (TA;) which is applied by Tarafeh to<br>\
the frights occasioned by a stallion-camel to a<br>\
she-camel when he desires to cover her. (EM,<br>\
p. 66.) It is said in a trad., فَأَعْطَاهُمْ بِرَوْعَةِ الخَيْلِ,<br>\
meaning And he gave them something for the<br>\
fright occasioned to their women and their<br>\
children by the horsemen. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A trait, or<br>\
sign, or mark, of beauty [that affects the رُوع, or<br>\
heart]: (IAar, K:) beauty that excites admiration and approval, or pleases, or rejoices. (TA.)<br>\
رُوَاعُ الفُؤَادِ and رُوَاعَةُ الفُؤَادِ, applied to a she-camel, Quick, spirited, vigorous; sharp in spirit;<br>\
syn. شَهْمَةٌ ذَكِيَّةٌ: (K:) and [in like manner]<br>\
↓ رَوْعَآءُ, applied to a she-camel and a mare, (S, K,)<br>\
but not to a male [in this sense, i. e. its masc.<br>\
form, أَرْوَعُ, is not thus used], (S,) sharp in spirit;<br>\
syn. حَدِيدَةُ الفُؤَادِ: (S, K:) in the T, رُوَاعٌ, without ة, is applied as an epithet to a mare: and<br>\
IAar says that ↓ رَوْعَآءُ, thus applied, is not from<br>\
رَائِعَةٌ, but means one that is as though she were<br>\
fearful, by reason of her sharpness, and briskness, or lightness, of spirit: he says also, that<br>\
↓ أَرْوَعُ, applied to a horse, is like this epithet<br>\
applied to a man; and IB says, in art. عجس,<br>\
that, applied to a man, it signifies quickly frightened or afraid: it is also applied to a heart,<br>\
meaning that is frightened, [or startled,] by reason<br>\
of its sharpness, at everything that is heard or<br>\
seen; and so رُوَاعٌ. (TA.) [See also رَائِعٌ, and<br>\
أَرْوَعُ mentioned and expl. therewith.]<br>\
رَائِعٌ [act. part. n. of رَاعَهُ, q. v.,] Frightening;<br>\
putting in fear; making afraid; [and particu-<br>\
larly] by its beauty and abundance or multitude.<br>\
(Lth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to beauty, That excites<br>\
admiration and approval in the رُوع [i. e. heart,<br>\
or mind,] of him who beholds it, and pleases him,<br>\
or rejoices him. (TA.) Applied to a man, (K, *<br>\
TA,) as also ↓ أَرْوَعُ (S, K, TA) so applied, (S,<br>\
TA,) Who excites admiration and approval by<br>\
his beauty (S, K, TA) and pleasingness of aspect,<br>\
(K, TA,) with generousness, or nobleness, and excellence, and lordly condition; (TA;) or by his<br>\
courage: (K, TA:) or the former, beautiful in<br>\
countenance, who excites admiration and approval<br>\
by his pleasingness of aspect and by the goodliness<br>\
of his form or figure or state of apparel and the<br>\
like: or, as some say, who frightens men by his<br>\
aspect, inspiring reverence or awe: but the former<br>\
explanation is the more reasonable: and ↓ the<br>\
latter epithet, a beautiful man, who excites admiration and approval in him who beholds him: or,<br>\
as some say, sharp; lively in spirit, and sharp in<br>\
intellect: (TA:) [see also the next preceding<br>\
paragraph:] the fem. of the former is with ة:<br>\
(TA:) that of the latter, ↓ رَوْعَآءُ: (S:) the pl. of<br>\
رَائِعٌ is أَرْوَاعٌ, (K, * TA,) applied to men, like as<br>\
رَوَائِعُ [the pl. of رَائِعَةٌ] is to women: (TA:) and<br>\
the pl. of أَرْوَعُ and رَوْعَآءُ is ↓ رُوعٌ, (K, TA,) applied<br>\
to men and to women. (TA.) You say also,<br>\
فَرَسٌ رَائِعٌ A beautiful horse, that frightens (يُرُوعُ,<br>\
i. e. يُخَوِّفُ, [or rather startles, but better rendered<br>\
excites admiration and approval in, or pleases,<br>\
or rejoices,]) the beholder by his beauty: (Mgh:)<br>\
and فَرَسٌ رَائِعَةٌ, and ↓ رَوْعَآءُ, [but see, respecting<br>\
the latter, a remark of IAar in the next preceding<br>\
paragraph,] a mare that excites admiration and<br>\
approval, or pleases, or rejoices, (تَرُوعُ,) by her<br>\
generousness, or excellence, or high blood, and her<br>\
description. (TA.) [See also art. ريع, to which, as<br>\
well as to the present art., رَائِعٌ, applied to a horse,<br>\
is said, in the TA, to belong.] And زِينَةٌ رَائِعَةٌ<br>\
Beautiful ornament. (TA.) And كَلَامٌ رَائِعٌ<br>\
(tropical:)  Surpassing, or excelling, speech, or language.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Frightened, or afraid; and so<br>\
↓ رَوِعٌ, with the و unaltered, as though it were of<br>\
the measure فَعِيلٌ: [or both signify having fright<br>\
or fear: for] each is a possessive epithet: or the<br>\
former may be of the measure فَاعِلٌ in the sense<br>\
of the measure مَفْعُولٌ [and therefore have the<br>\
signification first given]. (TA.)<br>\
أَرْوَعُ: fem. رَوْعَآءُ: pl. رُوعٌ: see the two paragraphs next preceding; the former in three places;<br>\
the latter, in five.<br>\
