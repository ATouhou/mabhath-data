his family, or wife, (S, K,) from a journey, (TA,)<br>\
and was congratulated with the annunciation that<br>\
a boy was born to him: whereupon he said,<br>\
“ What shall I do with him? Shall I eat him<br>\
or shall I drink him? ” so his wife said, غَرْثَانُ<br>\
فَارْبُكُوا لَهُ: and when he was satiated, he said,<br>\
“ How are the infant and his mother? ” (S, K:)<br>\
the saying means, “he is hungry, therefore prepare ye for him food, that his hunger may be<br>\
allayed, and then congratulate him with the annunciation of the birth of the child: ” and IDrd<br>\
says that it is applied to the case of him whose<br>\
anxiety has departed and who has become unoccupied so that he may attend to other things. (TA.)<br>\
