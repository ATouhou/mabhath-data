ترنّم; and ↓ رَنِمَ, (S, Msb,) aor.<br>\
رَنَمَ, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. [رَنَمٌ and] رَنِيمٌ; (TK;) i. q. رَجَّعَ صَوْتَهُ<br>\
(S, Msb) i. e. [He trilled, or quavered; or] he<br>\
reiterated his voice in his throat, or fauces, (S<br>\
and K and TA in art. رجع,) like [as is done in]<br>\
chanting, (S in that art.,) or in reading or reciting,<br>\
or singing, or piping, or other performances, of<br>\
such as are accompanied with quavering, or trilling: (TA in that art.:) both said of a singer:<br>\
(Msb:) and the former said of a bird, in its هَدِير<br>\
[or cooing]; (S, Msb;) and of a bow, when it is<br>\
twanged: (S:) and تَرْنِيمٌ [inf. n. of ↓ رنّم] signifies<br>\
the like: (S:) or التَّرْنِيمُ signifies تَطْرِيبُ الصَّوْتِ<br>\
[i. e. the trilling, or quavering, and prolonging<br>\
the voice; or prolonging the voice, and modulating<br>\
it sweetly, or warbling]; (T, * M, K;) and so<br>\
رَنِيمٌ [mentioned above as inf. n. of ↓ رَنِمَ]; (Lth,<br>\
T, M, K;) whence التَّرَنُّمُ [which signifies the<br>\
same, as is shown by what follows]: (Lth, T:)<br>\
↓ رنّم is said of the pigeon, (M, K,) and of the<br>\
[bird called] مُكَّاء, (M,) and of the [locust, or<br>\
species of locust, called] جُنْدَب [meaning it<br>\
chirped], and of the bow [meaning it emitted a<br>\
musical ringing sound, or a plaintive sound (see<br>\
تَرْنَمُوتٌ, below,) when twanged], (M, K,) and [in<br>\
like manner] of the lute, (M,) and of a thing<br>\
(M, K:) of any kind (M) of which the sound is<br>\
esteemed pleasant, or delightful; and تَرَنَّمَ likewise: (M, K:) or you say, الحَمَامَةُ تَتَرَنَّمُ [The<br>\
pigeon trills, or quavers, or cooes]: and of the<br>\
مُكَّآء you say, ↓ فِى صَوْتِهِ تَرْنِيمٌ [In its voice, or<br>\
cry, is a trilling, or quavering]: and of the bow,<br>\
and the lute, and a thing [of any kind] of which<br>\
the sound is esteemed pleasant, or delightful,<br>\
↓ لَهُ تَرْنِيمٌ [It has a musical ringing sound, or a<br>\
plaintive sound]. (Lth, T.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
مَا أَذِنَ اللّٰهُ لِشَىْءٍ أَذَنَهُ لِنَبِىٍّ حَسَنِ التَّرَنُّمِ بِالقُرْآنِ<br>\
[God has not listened to anything as He listens<br>\
to a prophet having a good manner of trilling, or<br>\
quavering, or prolonging and modulating sweetly<br>\
his voice, in reciting the Kur-án]: or, as some<br>\
relate it, حَسَنِ الصَّوْتِ يَتَرَنَّمُ بِالقُرْآنِ [good in respect of the voice, trilling, &amp;c., in reciting the<br>\
Kur-án]. (TA.)<br>\
رَنَمٌ i. q. صَوْتٌ [as meaning A voice, or sound;<br>\
or, more probably, the uttering thereof: see رَنِمَ,<br>\
of which it is an inf. n., in the next preceding<br>\
paragraph]. (S, K.)<br>\
رُنُمٌ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned;<br>\
app. pl. of ↓ رَانِمَةٌ; like as رُمُمٌ is supposed to be<br>\
of رَامَّةٌ, originally رَامِمَةٌ;] Good, or excellent,<br>\
female singers. (IAar, T, K.)<br>\
رَنْمَةٌ, (M, and so in copies of the K.) thus it<br>\
seems to be accord. to [a rule observed in] the K,<br>\
but accord. to Z it seems to be ↓ رَنَمَةٌ, (TA, and<br>\
thus it is written in the CK,) and ↓ تَرْنَمُوتَةٌ, (M,<br>\
and so in the K accord. to the TA,) or ↓ تَرْنَمُوتٌ,<br>\
(S, [and so in my MS. copy of the K,]) or this<br>\
last also, (M,) or ↓ تَرْنُومَةٌ or تُرْنُومَةٌ, (accord. to<br>\
other copies of the K,) i. q. تَرَنُّمٌ [i. e. A trilling,<br>\
or quavering, &amp;c.: see 5]. (S, M, K.) Thus in<br>\
the phrases, سَمِعَ رَنْمَةً حَسَنَةً and ↓ تَرْنَمُوتَةً [He<br>\
heard a good, or pleasing, trilling, &amp;c.]: (M:)<br>\
and لَهُ رَنْمَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ or ↓ رَنَمَةٌ and ↓ تَرْنَمُوتَةٌ &amp;c.<br>\
(accord. to different copies of the K) [i. e. He,<br>\
or it, has a good, or pleasing, trilling, &amp;c.].<br>\
↓ تَرْنَمُوتٌ is formed by the addition of و and ت,<br>\
like as is مَلَكُوتٌ: (S:) it is said to be the only instance in which ت is added at the beginning and<br>\
end of a word: (MF:) and it is used in relation<br>\
to a bow [as meaning A musical ringing sound<br>\
on the occasion of twanging]. (S, M.) [↓ رَنِيمٌ,<br>\
also, said in the TK to be an inf. n. of رَنِمَ, and in<br>\
the M and K to be syn. with تَرْنِيمٌ, is used in a<br>\
similar manner:] you say, سَمِعْتُ لَهُ رَنِيمًا [I heard<br>\
him to have a trilling, or quavering, sound proceeding from him; or I heard it to have a musical<br>\
ringing sound proceeding from it]; taken from<br>\
the تَرَنُّم of the bird in its cooing. (Msb.)<br>\
رَنَمَةٌ A certain slender plant, (T, K,) well<br>\
known; (T;) said by As to be one of the plants<br>\
growing in plain, or soft, ground: (A&#39;Obeyd, T:)<br>\
IAar is related to have said that the رَنَمَة, with ن,<br>\
is a certain species of tree: Sh knew not this<br>\
word, and supposed it to be a mistranscription<br>\
for رَتَمَة; but the رَتَم are [comparatively] large<br>\
trees, [or rather shrubs, of the broom-kind,]<br>\
having trunks; whereas the رنمة is of the slender<br>\
kind of plants [as is said above]. (T.)<br>\
