رَمَلَ as syn. with رَمَّلَ: see the latter in two<br>\
places.<br>\
-A2-  رَمَلَ الحَصِيرَ, [aor. app.<br>\
رَمُلَ, and inf. n.<br>\
رَمْلٌ;] and ↓ ارملهُ; He wove (نَسَجَ, A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
T, or سَفَّ, A &#39;Obeyd, S) the mat [of palm-leaves<br>\
or the like]. (T, S.) [Or] رَمَلَ السَّرِيرَ, and [so in<br>\
the M, but in the K “ or ”] الحَصِيرَ, aor.<br>\
رَمُلَ, inf. n.<br>\
رَمْلٌ, He ornamented the couch, and the mat,<br>\
with جَوْهَر [i. e. jewels, precious stones, gems, &amp;c.],<br>\
and the like. (M, K.) [Or] الحَصِيرَ ↓ ارمل, and<br>\
رَمَلَهُ, He made the weaving of the mat thin<br>\
(Har p. 55.) And رَمَلَ النَّسْجَ, (M, K,) aor. and<br>\
inf. n. as above; (TA;) and ↓ ارملهُ, and ↓ رمّلهُ;<br>\
(M, K; the last omitted in the TA;) He made<br>\
the woven thing, or the weaving, thin. (M, K.)<br>\
And رَمَلَ السَّرِيرَ, (S, K,) [aor. and] inf. n. as<br>\
above; (TA;) and ↓ ارملهُ; He wove (رَمَلَ) شَرِيط<br>\
[or palm leaves split and then plaited together],<br>\
(S, O, K,) or some other thing, (S, O,) and made<br>\
the same a back (جَعَلَهُ ظَهْرًا) to the couch. (S, O,<br>\
K. [What is here called the “ back ” of the<br>\
couch is app. so called as being likened to the<br>\
back of a beast on which one rides: see رُمَالٌ.])<br>\
Accord. to IKt, رَمَلْتُ السير [app. a mistranscription for السَّرِيرَ] and ↓ أَرْمَلْتُهُ signify I wove the<br>\
سير [or the سرير] with a شَرِيط of leaves, or fibres,<br>\
of the palm-tree. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] رَمَلْتُ القَوْلَ<br>\
and الوَصْفَ [(assumed tropical:)  I wove, i. e. composed, the saying<br>\
and the description]. (Phrases cited in the TA<br>\
from two modern poets.)<br>\

Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
رَمُلَ, (T, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. رَمَلَانٌ<br>\
(T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and رَمَلٌ (S, M, &amp;c.)<br>\
and مَرْمَلٌ, (K,) said of a man, i. q. هَرْوَلَ [i. e.<br>\
He went a kind of trotting pace, between a walk<br>\
and a run]; (S, Mgh, Msb, K; [in the M said<br>\
to be “ less than المَشْىُ and above العَدْوُ; ” app.,<br>\
as is remarked in the TT, through inadvertence<br>\
of a writer;]) i. e. (TA) he was quick in his<br>\
manner of walking, (T, TA,) and shook his<br>\
shoulder-joints, (TA,) leaping, (so in the T accord. to the TT,) or not leaping, (so in the TA,)<br>\
in doing so; (T, TA;) while performing the<br>\
circuitings round the Kaabeh, (T, Mgh, TA,)<br>\
but only in some of those circuitings, exclusively<br>\
of others, (TA,) which one does in imitation of<br>\
the Prophet and his Companions, who did thus<br>\
in order that the people of Mekkeh might know<br>\
that there was in them strength; (T, TA;) and<br>\
in going between Es-Safà and El-Marweh. (S,<br>\
TA.) [It is also said of a camel: see رَتَكَ.]<br>\
-A4-<br>\
رَمَلٌ as an inf. n. [app. of رَمِلَ العَامُ or رَمِلَتِ السَّنَةُ]<br>\
signifies The year&#39;s having little rain. (KL.) ―<br>\

رمّلهُ, (M, TA,) inf. n. تَرْمِيلٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
put رَمْل [i. e. sand] into it; namely, food; (M,<br>\
TA;) and (TA) so ↓ رَمَلَهُ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K, TA,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
رَمُلَ, inf. n. رَمْلٌ; but the former verb is the more<br>\
chaste. (TA.) Hence, in a trad. respecting [the<br>\
eating of the flesh of] domestic asses, أَمَرَ أَنْ تُكْفَأَ<br>\
القُدُورُ وَأَنْ يُرَمَّلَ اللَّحْمُ بِالتُّرَابِ, meaning [He<br>\
ordered that the cooking-pots should be turned<br>\
upside-down, and] that the flesh should be stirred<br>\
about and mixed with dust, in order that no use<br>\
might be made of it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He defiled,<br>\
or smeared, him, or it, with blood; (S, M, TA;)<br>\
namely, a man, (S,) or a garment, and the like;<br>\
(M, TA;) and (TA) so ↓ رَمَلَهُ; (K TA;) but<br>\
in this sense also the former verb is the more<br>\
chaste. (TA.) And رُمِّلَ فُلَانٌ بِالدَّمِ Such a one<br>\
was defiled, or smeared, with blood. (T, TA.<br>\
[See also 4 and 5.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  In relation to speech, or<br>\
language, (TA,) التَّرْمِيلُ signifies (tropical:)  i. q. التَّزْيِيفُ;<br>\
(K, TA; [in the CK, erroneously, التَّرْنِيفُ;])<br>\
i. e., [as inf. n. of رَمَّلَ, The adulterating it,<br>\
corrupting it, or rendering it unsound, or untrue;<br>\
and as inf. n. of رُمِّلَ,] its being [adulterated,<br>\
corrupted, or] unsound, or untrue. (TA. [See<br>\
the pass. part. n., below.]) ―<br>\

ارمل It (a place) became sandy; had رَمْل<br>\
in it or upon it. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And He clave to<br>\
the sand.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He became poor:<br>\
(Mgh:) or (assumed tropical:)  his provisions, or travelling-provisions, became difficult to obtain, and he became<br>\
poor: (Msb:) or his travelling-provisions went:<br>\
(Mgh:) and أَرْمَلُوا (tropical:)  their provisions, or travel-ling-provisions, became exhausted, or consumed:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, K, TA:) from الرَّمْلُ; (Mgh,<br>\
TA;) as though [he or] they clave to the sand;<br>\
(TA;) like أَدْقَعَ, (Mgh,) or أَدْقَعُوا, (TA,) from<br>\
الدَّقْعَآءُ: (Mgh, TA:) or from رَمَلٌ meaning “ little<br>\
rain: ” or from أَرْمَلَ الحَصِيرَ and رَمَلَهُ meaning<br>\
“ he made the weaving of the mat thin: ” (Har<br>\
p. 55:) and ارملوا زَادَهُمْ (tropical:)  They exhausted, or<br>\
consumed, their provisions, or travelling-provisions. (K, * TA. [In the TT, as from the M,<br>\
اتخذوه is erroneously put for أَنْفَدُوهُ, the explanation in the TA.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And [hence,] ارملت,<br>\
(Yz, T, S, Msb,) or, accord. to Sh, ارملت مِنْ<br>\
زَوْجِهَا, or من زوجها ↓ رَمِلَتٌ; (T, accord. to different copies;) and ↓ رَمَّلَتْ [alone], (K, TA,<br>\
[said in the latter to be on the authority of Sh,<br>\
and therefore it may perhaps be taken from a<br>\
copy of the T,]) inf. n. تَرْمِيلٌ; (TA;) (tropical:)  She (a<br>\
woman) became such as is termed أَرْمَلَةٌ, (T, Msb,<br>\
K, TA,) i. e. without a husband; (T, Msb;)<br>\
because of her being in need of one to expend<br>\
upon her; [for] Az says that she is not thus<br>\
called unless she be also poor: (Msb:) or [she<br>\
became a widow;] she lost her husband by his<br>\
death. (S.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And ارمل said of an arrow, It<br>\
became defiled, or smeared, with blood, (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, K, TA,) and had the mark thereof remaining upon it; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA;) and so<br>\
↓ ارتمل. (TA. [See also 2 and 5.])<br>\
-A2-  Said of a<br>\
poet, it is from الرَّمَلُ, like أَرْجَزَ from الرَّجَزُ; (TA;)<br>\
i. e. He versified, or composed verses, in the metre<br>\
termed الرَّمَلُ. (Ibn-Buzurj, L in art. قصد.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
As a trans. v.: see 1, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He<br>\
lengthened, or made long, a rope, or cord: (K:)<br>\
and in like manner, he lengthened, and widened;<br>\
or made long, and wide; a shackle, or shackles:<br>\
you say, ارمل لَهُ فِى قَيْدِهِ He lengthened, and<br>\
widened, or made long, and made wide, for him<br>\
his shackle, or shackles. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
ترمّل He became defiled, or smeared, (T, S,)<br>\
with his blood, (T,) or with blood; as also ↓ ارتمل.<br>\
(S. [See also 2 and 4.])<br>\
8<br>\
إِرْتَمَلَ see 4 and 5.<br>\
-A2-  You say also, ارتملت<br>\
فُلَانَةُ فِى بَنِيهَا (assumed tropical:)  Such a woman maintained, or<br>\
undertook the maintenance of, her children, her<br>\
husband having died. (O, TA. [But in both I<br>\
find فى بيتها, an obvious mistranscription, for<br>\
which I read فى بَنِيهَا; and in the explanation, in<br>\
both, اقامت عليهم, for which I read قَامَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ.])<br>\
رَمْلٌ [Sand;] a kind of dust or earth, (M,)<br>\
well known: (Lth, T, M, Msb, K:) ↓ رَمْلَةٌ is its<br>\
n. un.; (M, K;) a more special term than the<br>\
former; (S;) signifying a piece, or portion, [or<br>\
tract, or collection,] thereof: (Lth, T, TA:) [and<br>\
the former word is also sometimes used as meaning<br>\
a tract, or collection, of sand:] the pl. [of mult.]<br>\
is رَمَالٌ (Lth, T, S, M, Msb, K) and [of pauc.]<br>\
أَرْمُلٌ; (M, K;) [and أَرَمِلُ is used as a pl. pl.,<br>\
i. e. pl. of أَرْمُلٌ; occurring in a verse cited in the<br>\
TA, art. هج.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] أُمُّ رِمَالٍ a name of The<br>\
hyena. (ISk, S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] الرَّمْلُ, (TA in<br>\
this art., [in the Lexicons of Golius and Freytag,<br>\
erroneously, رَمَلٌ,]) or عِلْمُ الرَّمْلِ, i. q. عِلْمُ الخَطِّ,<br>\
(IAar, TA in art. خط,) [Geomancy,] a certain<br>\
well-known science. (TA in the present art. [See<br>\
a description of it voce خَطَّ.])<br>\
رَمَلٌ Weak rain: (IAar, T:) or little rain:<br>\
(Har p. 55:) or a small quantity of rain: (ElUmawee, T, S, M, K:) one says, أَصَابَهُمْ رَمَلٌ مِنْ<br>\
مَطَرٍ A small quantity of rain fell upon them:<br>\
(El-Umawee, T, M:) but Sh says, “I have not<br>\
heard رَمَلٌ in this sense except on the authority<br>\
of El-Umawee: ” (TA:) the pl. is أَرْمَالٌ. (T, S,<br>\
M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps,] أَرْمَالٌ مِنْ إِبِلٍ A number of camels in a state of dispersion. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also, the sing., [as a coll. gen. n.,] Lines, or<br>\
streaks, upon the legs of the wild cow, (S, M, K,)<br>\
upon her fore legs and kind legs, (M,) differing<br>\
from the rest of her colour: (S, M, K:) n. un.<br>\
↓ رَمَلَةٌ. (TA. [See also رُمْلَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A redundance, or an excess, (زِيَادَةٌ,) in a thing. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  الرَّمَلُ is also the name of A certain kind of<br>\
metre of verse; (T, S, M, K;) [the eighth kind;]<br>\
the measure of which is [originally] composed of<br>\
فَاعِلَاتُنْ (T, TA) six times; (TA;) so called from<br>\
الرَّمَلُ signifying “ a certain kind of walk or pace,”<br>\
inf. n. of رَمَلَ [q. v.]: (M, K: *) and Kh says<br>\
that it is also applied to any meagre verse or<br>\
poetry, incongruous in structure; such being so<br>\
named by the Arabs without their defining anything respecting it; as, for instance, the saying [of<br>\
&#39;Abeed Ibn-El-Abras (TA in arts. ذنب and<br>\
قطب)],<br>\
فَالقُطَبِيَّاتُ فَالذَّنُوبُ  أَقْفَرَ مِنْ أَهْلِهِ مَلْحوبُ<br>\
[Melhoob (the name of a place, K in art. لحب)<br>\
has become destitute of its inhabitants, and El-<br>\
Kutabeeyát, (by which is meant a certain water,<br>\
called القُطَبِيَّةُ, with its environs, K* and TA in<br>\
art. قطب,) and Edh-Dhanoob (the name of a<br>\
place, TA in art. ذنب)]: he says also that, generally, the مَجْزُوْء [i. e. what is curtailed of two of<br>\
the original feet, or what consists of two feet<br>\
only,] is thus called by them: accord. to IJ, it is<br>\
applied by them to verse, or poetry, that is incongruous, unsound, or faulty, in structure, and<br>\
such as falls short of the original [standard so<br>\
as not to answer completely to any regular kind<br>\
or species]: (M, TA:) thus it signifies as first<br>\
explained above, and also any verse, or poetry,<br>\
that is not such as is termed قَصِيد [as meaning<br>\
that of which the hemistichs are complete] nor<br>\
such as is termed رَجَز [which some hold to be not<br>\
verse, or poetry, but a kind of rhyming prose].<br>\
(IJ, M, K. *) [See also زَمَلٌ.]<br>\
رَمْلَةٌ: see رَمْلٌ, of which it is the n. un.<br>\
رُمْلَةٌ sing. of رُمَلٌ, which signifies The diversity<br>\
of colours (وَشْىٌ) upon the legs of the wild bull:<br>\
(T: [see also رَمَلٌ:]) or رُمْلَةٌ signifies a black line<br>\
or streak, (IKh, M, IB, K,) as some say, (M,)<br>\
such as is upon the back and thighs of the gazelle:<br>\
(IKh, IB:) pl. [of mult.] رُمَلٌ and [of pauc.]<br>\
أَرْمَالٌ. (K.)<br>\
رَمَلَةٌ: see رَمَلٌ.<br>\
[<br>\
رَمْلِىٌّ Of, or relating to, رَمْل (or sand):<br>\
sandy.]<br>\
رُمَالٌ The woven work of a mat. (K, TA.) It<br>\
is said in a trad., of the Prophet, that he was lying<br>\
upon his side on the رمال of a mat, which had<br>\
made an impression upon his side: (T, TA: *) or,<br>\
as some relate it, of a couch; meaning, in this<br>\
case, that its face was woven of palm-leaves, and<br>\
that it had nothing spread upon it to lie upon, but<br>\
the mat only. (TA. [See رَمَلَ السَّرِيرَ.])<br>\
رَمِيلَةٌ Land (أَرْض) rained upon with الرَّمَل, i. e.<br>\
little rain. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA.)<br>\
رَمَّالٌ A practiser of the science called الرَّمْلُ<br>\
[i. e. geomancy]. (TA.)<br>\
رَامِلَةٌ sing. of رَوَامِلُ, (TA,) which signifies<br>\
Female weavers of mats. (T, TA.)<br>\
أَرْمَلُ i. q. ↓ مُرْمِلٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  A man whose<br>\
provisions, or travelling-provisions, have become<br>\
difficult to obtain, [or exhausted, or consumed,<br>\
(see 4,)] and who has become poor: [as though<br>\
he were cleaving to the sand: (see again 4:)] pl.<br>\
أَرَامِلُ: (Msb:) or أَرْمَلُ is applied to a man, and<br>\
↓ أَرْمَلَةٌ to a woman, (M, K,) and the latter also<br>\
to a pl. number, (M,) as meaning needy, needing,<br>\
or in want: (M, K:) or as meaning [مِسْكِينٌ and]<br>\
مِسْكِينَةٌ [and مَسَاكِينُ, i. e. destitute, or indigent,<br>\
&amp;c.]: (K:) and the pl. is أَرَامِلُ and أَرَامِلَةٌ; (M,<br>\
K;) after the manner of substs., because the<br>\
quality of a subst. is predominant therein: (M:)<br>\
↓ أَرْمَلَةٌ is applied to any collective number of men<br>\
and women, or men without women, or women<br>\
without men, after they have become in need or<br>\
want: (M:) [and] it is applied [also] to a man<br>\
and to a woman as meaning poor so as to be<br>\
unable to obtain anything: (T, and Mgh as from<br>\
the T:) accord. to ISk, أَرَامِلُ is applied to a number of men and women, as meaning مَسَاكِينُ<br>\
[expl. above]; (T, S, Mgh;) or so to a number of<br>\
persons whether men or women; (Msb;) and to<br>\
men though there be not among them women;<br>\
(T, S, Mgh;) and so ↓ أَرْمَلَةٌ: (T, Mgh:) or this<br>\
last, to a number of men and women needy,<br>\
needing, or in want; (S;) and to men needy,<br>\
needing, or in want, and weak, (S, K,) though<br>\
there be not among them women. (S.) Ibn-Buzurj mentions the saying, إِنّ بَيْتَ فُلَانٍ لَضَخْمٌ<br>\
مَا يُحْمِّلُونَهُ إِلَّا مَا اسْتَفْقَرُوا لَهُ ↓ وَإِنَّهُمْ لَأَرْمَلَةُ, meaning [Verily the household of such a one is large,<br>\
and verily they are destitute of what camels they<br>\
may load therewith except] what they borrow<br>\
[for that purpose]; (T, * TA;) i. e., they are<br>\
a party not possessing camels, and unable to make<br>\
a journey except upon camels that they borrow;<br>\
[استفقروا being] from أُفْقِرَ ظَهْرَ بَعِيرِى signifying<br>\
“ he was lent the back of my camel. ” (TA.)<br>\
See also أُرْمُولَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  ↓ أَرْمَلَةٌ is also applied to a<br>\
woman as meaning Having no husband: (T, S,<br>\
M, Msb, K:) or a widow; one whose husband<br>\
has died: (IAmb, Mgh:) or not if she possesses<br>\
competence, or wealth: (Ibn-Buzurj, T, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K:) it is applied to her who has no husband<br>\
because she is in need of him who would expend<br>\
upon her; (Msb;) or to her whose husband has<br>\
died because her provision has gone and she has<br>\
lost him who earned for her (IAmb, Mgh) and<br>\
by means of whom her state of life had been<br>\
good: (IAmb:) in like manner, also, أَرْمَلُ is<br>\
applied to a man as meaning having no wife,<br>\
(T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) accord. to Kt (T, Mgh)<br>\
and Sh; (Mgh;) like as أَيِّمٌ is applied to a man<br>\
[as well as to a woman], and أَيِّمَةٌ to a woman:<br>\
(T:) or a widower; one whose wife has died:<br>\
(TA:) or أَرْمَلُ is not applied in this sense except<br>\
in cases of deviation from the usual course of<br>\
speech, (IAmb, Mgh, Msb, [and the like is said<br>\
in the Mgh also as on the authority of Lth, and in<br>\
the M as on the authority of IJ,]) because the<br>\
man&#39;s provision does not go in consequence of the<br>\
death of his wife, since she is not his maintainer,<br>\
(IAmb, Mgh, Msb,) whereas he is her maintainer: (IAmb:) Jereer says,<br>\
كُلُّ الأَرَامِلِ قَدْ قَضَيْتَ حَاجَتَهَا<br>\
فَمَنْ لِحَاجَةِ هٰذَا الأَرَمَلِ الذَّكَرِ<br>\
(M, TA,) or هٰذِى الأَرَامِلُ الخ; (S, Mgh; [in the<br>\
former ascribed in one of my copies to an unnamed poet, and in the other, to El-Hotei-ah;<br>\
but in the Mgh, to Jereer, as in the M;]) [i. e.<br>\
All the widows, or these widows, thou hast accomplished their want; but who is there for the want<br>\
of this male widowed person]; meaning thereby<br>\
himself. (M, TA.) It is said that, if one bequeath his property to the أَرَامِل, some of it is to<br>\
the men whose wives have died: (Mgh:) IB<br>\
says, on the authority of IKt, that when a man<br>\
says, “This property is for the أَرَامِل,” it is for<br>\
the men and the women, because الأَرَامِلُ applies<br>\
to the males and the women; but he adds, IAmb<br>\
says that it is to be given to the women exclusively<br>\
of the men, because الارامل generally applied to<br>\
the women. (TA. [This is cited in the TA as<br>\
though relating to ارامل as meaning مَسَاكِين:<br>\
but IAmb evidently uses it here as applying to<br>\
women whose husbands have died; and this is its<br>\
predominant meaning.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is also applied to<br>\
a [lizard of the kind called] ضَبّ, in the following<br>\
saying of a rájiz,<br>\
أُحبُّ أَنْ أَصْطَادَ ضَبًّا سَحْبَلَا<br>\
رَعَى الرَّبِيعَ وَالشِّتَآءَ أَرْمَلَا<br>\
(T, TA,) meaning [I love to hunt out, or catch,<br>\
a large ضبّ, that has pastured during the autumn<br>\
and the winter,] having no female, so that he may<br>\
be fat. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And one says also عَامٌ أَرْمَلُ<br>\
(ISk, T, S, M, K) and سَنَةٌ رَمْلَآءُ (ISk, T, S, M)<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  A year of little rain (ISk, T, S, M, K,<br>\
TA) and of little good or benefit. (T, M, K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. أَبْلَقُ [i. e. Black and white: or white<br>\
in the kind legs as high as the thighs]: (AA, T:)<br>\
or a sheep or goat of which all the legs are black:<br>\
fem. رَمْلَآءُ: (A &#39;Obeyd, S:) or the latter is applied<br>\
to a ewe as meaning of which the legs are black,<br>\
the rest of her being white. (AZ, T, M, K.)<br>\
أَرْمَلَةٌ as fem. of أَرْمَلُ, and as an epithet applied<br>\
to a pl. number of persons: see the next preceding<br>\
paragraph in five places.<br>\
أُرْمُولَةٌ, as an epithet applied to a boy, or young<br>\
man, (غُلَامٌ, Lth, T, Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K,) i. q. ↓ أَرْمَلُ<br>\
[as meaning Poor, needy, or the like]; (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, K;) accord. to Lth, (T, TA,) i. q. زَارَهْ<br>\
[i. e. abject] in Persian: (T, M, TA: [but in<br>\
two copies of the T زَاذَهْ; and in the TT, as from<br>\
the M, زَازَهْ:]) but Az says, I know not الأُرْمُولَةُ,<br>\
nor the Persian rendering thereof. (T.)<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
The stump (جُذْمُور) of the [plant, or tree, called]<br>\
عَرْفَج: pl. أَرَامِلُ and أَرَامِيلُ: (K:) or أَرَامِلُ<br>\
العَرفَجِ signifies the stocks, or stems, (أُصُول, [but<br>\
this sometimes means stumps, as well as roots,<br>\
&amp;c.,]) of the عرفج. (M.)<br>\
مُرْمَلٌ: see مَرْمُولٌ.<br>\
مُرْمِلٌ A man whose provisions, or travellingprovisions, are exhausted, or consumed. (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
T.) See also أَرْمَلُ, first sentence.<br>\
