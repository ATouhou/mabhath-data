which a man, or some other thing, remains still,<br>\
or motionless. (S, A, * L.) And Much depressed<br>\
parts of the earth. (L.) Usámeh Ibn-Habeeb<br>\
El-Hudhalee says, describing an ass [i. e. a wild<br>\
ass] that had been chased by horses, or horsemen,<br>\
and had fied for refuge to the mountains, whence,<br>\
from their ravines, he saw the sky like streaks,<br>\
أَرْتْهُ مِنَ الجَرْبَآءِ فِى كُلِّ مَوْطِنٍ<br>\
طِبَابًا فَمَثْوَاهُ النَّهَارَ المَرَاكِدُ<br>\
[They (the ravines) showed him, in every spot<br>\
where he stopped, streaks of the shy, and the<br>\
much-depressed parts of the earth were his places<br>\
of abode all the day]. (S, * L.) [J quotes this<br>\
verse, in the S, but with مَنْزِلٍ in the place of<br>\
موطن, and مَرْعَاهُ in the place of مثواه, as an ex. of<br>\
مراكد in the former of the senses explained<br>\
above.]<br>\
