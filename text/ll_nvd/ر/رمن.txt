load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'رمنرُمَّانٌ [The pomegranate;] a certain fruit, (T,)<br>\
the produce of a certain tree, (M,) well known:<br>\
(T, S, M, K:) n. un. with ة: (S, M, Msb, K:)<br>\
the sweet sort thereof relaxes the state of the<br>\
bowels, and cough; the sour sort has the contrary<br>\
effect; and that which is between sweet and sour<br>\
is good for inflammation of the stomach, and<br>\
pain of the heart: the رمّان has six flavours,<br>\
like the apple; and is commended for its delicacy,<br>\
its quick dissolving, and its niceness, or its elegance:<br>\
(K:) رُمَّانٌ is of the measure فُعْلَانٌ accord. to Sb:<br>\
(M in art. رم:) Kh, being asked by Sb respecting الرُّمَّان, (S,) or [rather] respecting رُمَّان, (M in<br>\
art. رم,) when used as a proper name, (S,) said that<br>\
he declined it imperfectly (S, M) when [thus made]<br>\
determinate; (S;) and that he made it to accord<br>\
to the majority, because its derivation is unknown,<br>\
(S, M, *) i. e., that he regarded its ا and ن as augmentative: (S:) but accord. to Akh, the ن is<br>\
radical, (S,) [i. e.] he held it to be of the measure فُعَّالٌ, making it to accord to many similar<br>\
names of plants, (M,) like حُمَّاضٌ &amp;c., (S, M,)<br>\
فُعَّالٌ being more common than فُعْلَان; (S;) he<br>\
meant, as applied to plants; for otherwise the<br>\
contr. is the case: (TA:) [Fei says,] the measure<br>\
is فُعَّالٌ, the ن being radical, and therefore the<br>\
word is perfectly decl., unless when used as a<br>\
proper name, in which case it is imperfectly decl.,<br>\
being made to accord to the majority [of proper<br>\
names ending with ا and ن, as عُثْمَانُ &amp;c.].<br>\
(Msb.) [Freytag mentions several varieties of<br>\
رمّان, as follows: but the names, as given by him<br>\
and here transcribed, require verification or correction: “ رمان القسطيسى, رمان المرسى, رمان<br>\
العدسى, رمان الخزاينى, رمان الترحين, رمان<br>\

رمان امليسى Malum Punicum maximum, esu<br>\

رمان الدلوى, رمان الدوارى, sunt minoris magnitudinis, formæ rotundæ: رمان السفريا Malum<br>\
Punicum magnitudine et sapore præstantissimum,<br>\
a viro Sefri dicto ita appellatum, quod a Syria<br>\
Cordubam regnante Abd-Alrahmano hanc speciem<br>\
transtulerat: ” and he refers to “ Casiri, Bibl. Ar.<br>\
Hisp. T. i. p. 329; and Avicenn. L. ii. p. 254; ”<br>\
the latter of which authors only mentions the<br>\
properties of the رمّان.] ―<br>\

CK السُّعالَى] The white خَشْخَاش [or poppy]: or<br>\

which is the fodder, of the horse. (M and TA<br>\
in art. رم and in the present art.) One says,<br>\
مَلَأَتِ الدَّابَّةُ رُمَّانَتَهَا (assumed tropical:)  [The beast filled its رمّانة].<br>\
(TA.) And أَكَلَ حَتَّى نَتَأَتْ رُمَّانَتَهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
ate until his navel with the parts around it projected. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [(assumed tropical:)  A knob of metal, of wood, and<br>\
