رَجْمٌ signifies The throwing, or casting, of<br>\
stones: (S, K:) this is its primary meaning:<br>\
(S, TA:) you say, رَجَمَهُ, aor.<br>\
رَجُمَ, inf. n. رَجْمٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb, TA,) He threw, or cast, stones at him;<br>\
or pelted him with stones: (S, TA:) or he struck<br>\
him, or smote him, with رَجَم, meaning stones:<br>\
(Msb:) and رُجُومٌ is syn. with رَجْمٌ, as an inf. n.:<br>\
thus some explain the saying, in the Kur [lxvii. 5],<br>\
وَجْعَلْنَاهَا رُجُومًا لِلشَّيَاطِينِ [And we have made<br>\
them for casting at the devils; meaning shooting<br>\
stars, which are believed to be hurled at the devils<br>\
that listen by stealth, beneath the lowest heaven,<br>\
to the words of the angels therein: but see other<br>\
explanations below, voce رَجْمٌ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
(S, TA,) The act of slaying [in any manner, but<br>\
generally stoning, i. e. putting to death by stoning].<br>\
(S, K.) So in رَجْمُ الثَّيِّبَيْنِ إِذَا زَنَيَا [The slaying,<br>\
or stoning, of the two married persons when they<br>\
have committed adultery]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [(assumed tropical:)  The act<br>\
of beating, or battering, the ground with the feet.]<br>\
One says of a camel, يَرْجُمُ الأَرْضَ (assumed tropical:)  [He beats, or<br>\
batters, the ground], i. e., with his feet; which<br>\
implies commendation: (TA:) and so one says<br>\
of a horse; (K;) or يُرْجُمُ فِى الأَرْضِ. (S.) And<br>\
one says also, جَآءَ يَرْجُمُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [He came<br>\
beating, or battering, the ground; or] passing<br>\
along with an ardent and a rapid running. (Lh,<br>\
K, * TA.) [See also 8.] ―<br>\
-b4-  (tropical:)  The act of cursing.<br>\
(K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  The act of reviling. (K, TA.)<br>\
لَأَرْجُمَنَّكَ, in the Kur xix. 47, means (assumed tropical:)  I will<br>\
assuredly revile thee: (Bd, Jel, TA: see also<br>\
another explanation below, in this paragraph:)<br>\
or I will assuredly cast stones at thee, (Bd, Jel,)<br>\
so that thou shalt die, or shalt remove far from<br>\
me. (Bd.) And you say, رَجَمْتُهُ بِالقَوْلِ, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I uttered foul, or evil, speech against him.<br>\
(Msb.) [See also رَجَبَهُ.] ―<br>\
-b6-  (assumed tropical:)  The act of driving<br>\
away; expelling; putting, or placing, at a distance, away, or far away. (K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  (assumed tropical:)  The act of<br>\
cutting off from friendly, or loving communion<br>\
or intercourse; forsaking; or abandoning. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  Also [as being likened to the throwing of<br>\
stones, in doing which one is not sure of hitting<br>\
the mark,] i. q. قَذْفٌ (K, TA) بِالغَيْبِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The act of speaking of that which is hidden, or<br>\
which has not become apparent to the speaker;<br>\
and conjecturing]; (TA;) or speaking conjecturally: (S, TA:) and (K, TA) some say (TA)<br>\
i. q. غَيْبٌ [as meaning (assumed tropical:)  a doubting]: (K, TA:<br>\
[in the CK, العَيْبُ is erroneously put for الغَيْبُ:]<br>\
and ظَنٌّ [which means (assumed tropical:)  an opining, or a conjecturing]. (K, TA.) One says, رَجَمَ بِالغَيْبِ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
spoke of that which he did not know. (Ham<br>\
p. 494.) And رَجَمَ بِالظَّنِّ (Z, TA) (assumed tropical:)  He spoke<br>\
conjecturally: (MA:) or he conjectured, or<br>\
opined. (Bd in xviii. 21.) Hence, قَالَهُ رَجْمًا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He said it conjecturally. (Z, TA.) Hence also,<br>\
(TA,) رَجْمًا بَالغَيْبِ, in the Kur [xviii. 21], (S,<br>\
TA,) (assumed tropical:)  [Speaking conjecturally of that which is<br>\
hidden, or unknown; as indicated in the S and<br>\
TA: or] conjecturing in a case hidden from them.<br>\
(Jel.) One says also, قَالَ رَجْمًا بِالغَيْبِ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
said conjecturally, [or speaking of that which<br>\
was hidden from him, or unknown by him,] without evidence, and without proof. (Msb.) And<br>\
صَارَ رَجْمًا لَا يُوقَفُ عَلَى حَقِيقَةِ أَمْرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [It became<br>\
a subject of conjecture, the real state of the case<br>\
whereof one was not to be made to know]. (S,<br>\
TA.) And لَأَرْجُمَنَّكَ, in the Kur [xix. 47, of<br>\
which two explanations have been mentioned<br>\
above], means [accord. to some] I will assuredly<br>\
say of thee, [though] speaking of that which is<br>\
hidden [from me], or unknown [by me], what<br>\
thou dislikest, or hatest. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  لِسَانٌ يُرْجُمُ<br>\
[if the latter word be not a mistranscription for<br>\
↓ مِرْجَمٌ, q. v.,] means A tongue that is chaste, or<br>\
perspicuous, and copious, in speech. (Msb in art.<br>\
ترجم.) ―<br>\
-b10-  See also the next paragraph, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
2<br>\
رجّم القَبْرَ, inf. n. تَرْجِيمٌ, He placed upon the<br>\
grave رُجَم [meaning large stones, to make a<br>\
gibbous covering to it]. (TA.) It is related in a<br>\
trad. of &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Mughaffal, that he said,<br>\
لَا تُرَجِّمُوا قَبْرِى, i. e. Place not ye upon my grave<br>\
رُجَم; meaning thereby that they should make his<br>\
grave even with the ground, not gibbous and<br>\
elevated: the verb is thus correctly, with tesh-deed: but the relaters of trads. say, ↓ لا تَرْجُمُوا<br>\
قبرى: (S:) [and it is said that] القَبْرَ ↓ رَجَمَ, (K,<br>\
TA,) aor.<br>\
رَجُمَ, inf. n. رَجْمٌ, (TA,) signifies عَلَّمَهُ,<br>\
(K,) i. e. He put a tombstone to the grave: (TK:)<br>\
or he placed upon the grave رِجَام [a pl., like رُجَم,<br>\
of رُجْمَة]: (K:) or, accord. to Aboo-Bekr, لَا<br>\
قَبْرِى ↓ تَرْجُمُوا means Wail not ye at my grave;<br>\
i. e. say not, at it, what is unseemly; from الرَّجْمُ<br>\
signifying “ the act of reviling. ” (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
مُرَاجَمَةٌ [in its primary acceptation] is The<br>\
mutual throwing, or casting, of stones; or the<br>\
vying, or contending for superiority, in the throwing, or casting, of stones. (Mgh. [See also 6.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  The act of mutually reviling; or<br>\
the vying in reviling; or so مُرَاجَمَةٌ بِالكَلَامِ. (TA.<br>\
[See, again, 6.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And رَاجم فِى الكَلَامِ, and<br>\
العَدْوِ, and الحَرْبِ, (K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,)<br>\

6<br>\
تراجموا بَالحِجَارَةِ They threw, or cast, stones,<br>\
one at another; or vied, or contended for superiority, in throwing, or casting, stones, one at<br>\
another: (S, TA:) and ↓ ارتجموا signifies the like<br>\
of this. (IAar, TA. [See also 3.]) ―<br>\

تراجمت الإِبِلُ: see 8. ―<br>\

one another. (TA. [See, again, 3.])<br>\

↓ تراجمت, (assumed tropical:)  The camels beat [or battered] the<br>\
ground (رَجَمَتِ الأَرْضَ) with their feet: or went<br>\
heavily, without slowness. (TA.) [See مِرْجَمٌ: and<br>\

cast, like as is a stone: pl. رُجُومٌ. (Bd ib., and<br>\
K.) Hence, in the Kur (ubi suprà), وَجَعَلْنَاهَا<br>\
رُجُومًا لِلشَّيَاطِينِ And we have made them things<br>\
to be cast at the devils; meaning shooting stars:<br>\
[see also رُجُمْ:] or, as some say, we have made<br>\
them to be [means of] conjectures to the devils of<br>\
mankind; i. e., to the astrologers. (Bd, TA. [See<br>\
