رَعٌّ The being still, syn. سُكُونٌ, [a signification contr. to one borne by two other words<br>\
in this art.,] (IAar, K,) is the inf. n. of رَعَّتِ<br>\
الرِّيحُ, aor.<br>\
رَعُ3َ, [probably a mistake for<br>\
رَعِ3َ, which<br>\

IN the L we find إِذَا لَمْ تَكُنْ رَيِّضًا, [meaning when<br>\
it was not trained, رَيِّضًا being here used in the<br>\
sense of مَرُوضَةً,] in the place of إِذَا كَانَتْ رَيِّضًا,<br>\

ground. (TK.) And تَرَعْرَعَ السَّرَابُ (assumed tropical:)  The mirage<br>\

رَعَاعٌ Young men of the lowest, or basest, or<br>\

form of the latter word, and the most usual with<br>\
classical writers], as meaning the refuse, and<br>\

frightened, fly. (TA.) ―<br>\
