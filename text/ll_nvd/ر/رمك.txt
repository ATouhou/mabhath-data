رَمَكَ بِالمَكَانِ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
رَمُكَ, (S,) inf. n.<br>\
رُمُوكٌ, (S, K,) He remained, stayed, dwelt, or<br>\
abode, in the place, (S, Msb, K,) not quitting it:<br>\
or he did so being fatigued, or wearied, or distressed: (K:) or رَمَكَ signifies he (a man) made<br>\
his home, or constant residence, in a country, or<br>\
town. (AZ, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَمَكَتِ المَاشِيَةُ, (O,) or الإِبِلُ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. as above, (O,) The cattle were confined, (O,) or the camels kept constantly, (K,)<br>\
at the water, (O, K,) and were fed with fodder.<br>\
(O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  رَمَكَ فِى الطَّعَامِ, aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
[app. He kept constantly to the food;] he loathed<br>\
nothing of the food: and so رَجَنَ, aor.<br>\
رَمُكَ, inf. n.<br>\
رُجُونٌ: (L, TA:) both mentioned by Lh. (TA<br>\
in art. رجن.)<br>\
-A2-  رَمَكَ, said of a man, also signifies He was, or became, lean, or emaciated, and<br>\
what was in his hands went away. (O, TA. [See<br>\
also 9: and see رَمَكَةٌ, as applied to a man.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[It seems also that this verb is used in a similar<br>\
sense in relation to a beast; like ارمكّ said of a<br>\
camel: for it is immediately added in the O and<br>\
TA without any explanation, that one also says,<br>\
↓ هٰذِهِ دَابَّةٌ رَامِكَةٌ, as though meaning This is a<br>\
lean beast: and رَمَكَتْ, inf. n. رُمُوكٌ, as though<br>\
meaning It was, or became, lean.]<br>\
4<br>\
أَرْمَكْتُهُ I made him to remain, stay, dwell,<br>\
or abide, in a place, (S, K,) not quitting it. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And ارمك الإِبِلَ He (a pastor) kept the camels<br>\
constantly at the water, and fed them with fodder.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
9<br>\
ارمكّ He was, or became, of the colour<br>\
termed رُمْكَةٌ: said of a camel in this sense [and<br>\
in another expl. in what follows]. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  It<br>\
(a thing, Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O) was, or became, thin,<br>\
or slender. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.) And He (a<br>\
camel) was, or became, lean, lank, light of flesh;<br>\
slender; or lean, and lank in the belly; and emaciated. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K. [In the CK, نَهِكَ is<br>\
erroneously put for نُهِكَ.])<br>\
10<br>\
اِسْتَرْمَكَ القَوْمُ (tropical:)  The people were deemed<br>\
ignoble; (K, TA;) as being likened to the رَمَكَة.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رَمَكٌ: see رَمَكَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  In the saying of Ru-beh,<br>\
يَرْبِضُ فِى الرَّوْثِ كَبِرْذَوْنِ الرَّمَكْ<br>\
[That lies down upon his breast in the dung of<br>\
horses, or similar beasts, like the jade, or hack, of<br>\
the رَمَك], AA says, الرمك, here, is from the Pers.<br>\
رَمَهْ [which means a “ herd,&quot; ” “ flock,” “ troop,”<br>\
or the like]; and he adds that the people&#39;s saying<br>\
that it means الرَّمَكَة is a mistake. (O, TA. [Perhaps, however, AA knew not رَمَكٌ as a coll.<br>\
gen. n. of which رَمَكَةٌ is the n. un.; for as such it<br>\
seems to me more reasonable to regard it in this<br>\
instance.])<br>\
رُمْكَةٌ A certain colour of camels; accord. to<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd, a dun colour; i. e. a كٌمْتَة [or brown<br>\
hue] so intense as to have in it a blackness: (S:)<br>\
thus explained by As: (TA:) or, in the colours<br>\
of camels, brownness; i. e. redness intermixed<br>\
with blackness: (Kr, TA:) or a colour more<br>\
dusky, or dingy, than that which is termed زُرْقَة<br>\
[q. v.]: (Msb:) or the colour of ashes: (K:) or<br>\
وُرْقَةٌ [which is a colour like that of ashes] inclining to blackness: or, as some say, دُونَ الوُرْقَةِ<br>\
[less intense than what is termed وَرقة]: (TA:)<br>\
it sometimes has for its pl. رُمُكٌ, with two dammehs. (ISd, TA.)<br>\
رَمَكَةٌ A mare: and [particularly] a بِرْذَوْنَة [or<br>\
mare of mean breed], (Lth, Mgh, K,) the female<br>\
of the بَرَاذِين, (S, Msb,) that is taken for breeding: (Lth, Mgh, K:) pl. رِمَاكٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
accord. to rule, (Mgh,) and, رَمَكَاتٌ, (S,) and أَرْمَاكٌ,<br>\
(Fr, S, Mgh,) formed on the supposition of the<br>\
elision of the ة, (Mgh,) or this is a pl. pl., and<br>\
the pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] is ↓ رَمَكٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also (assumed tropical:)  A weak man. (K.)<br>\
رَامَكٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
رَامِكٌ Remaining, staying, dwelling, or abiding,<br>\
in a place, (Msb, K,) not quitting: or especially,<br>\
when fatigued, or wearied, or distressed. (K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also 1, last sentence.<br>\
-A3-  Also, and ↓ رَامَكٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) the former of which is the more<br>\
usual, or more approved, (TA,) A certain thing,<br>\
black, (S, Msb, K,) like pitch, (Msb,) that is<br>\
mixed with musk, (S, Msb, K,) and is then called<br>\
(يُجْعَلُ) musk. (Msb.) [Freytag, as on the<br>\
authority of the K, in which nothing more is said<br>\
respecting it than what I have given above,<br>\
describes it thus: “ Res ex aliis rebus composita,<br>\
nempe atramento sutorio, mali Punici cortice,<br>\
gummi Arabico aliisque rebus, quibus admisceri<br>\
solet muscus. ”] A poet says, (S,) namely, Khalaf<br>\
Ibn-Khaleef El-Akta&#39;, (O, TA,)<br>\
إِنَّ لَكَ الفَضْلَ عَلَى صُحْبَتِى<br>\
وَالمِسْكُ قَدْ يَسْتَصْحِبُ الرَّامَكَا<br>\
[Verily thou hast such excellence as renders thee<br>\
above my companionship; but musk sometimes<br>\
unites with رامك]. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [↓ رَامَكٌ, from the<br>\
Pers. رَامَكْ, is also the name of A certain astringent medicine, used as a remedy for dysentery<br>\
&amp;c. In the printed edition of the “ Kánoon ” of<br>\
Ibn-Seenà (Avicenna), book ii. p. 253, it is erroneously written رمك.]<br>\
أَرْمَكُ Of the colour termed رُمْكَةٌ: (S, Msb, K:)<br>\
applied to a camel: fem. رَمْكَآءُ. (S, Msb.) The<br>\
رمكآء is said by Honeyf-el-Hanátim, who was one<br>\
of the most skilled of the Arabs respecting camels,<br>\
to be the most beautiful of she-camels. (TA.)<br>\
The fem. is also applied, tropically, to a woman.<br>\
(Th, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A poet says, [applying it to dust,]<br>\
وَالخَيْلُ تَجْتَابُ الغُبَارَ الأَرْمَكَا<br>\
[And the horses, or horsemen, cleave the dark<br>\
brown, or ash-coloured, &amp;c., dust]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And it is said in a trad., [but to what it relates I<br>\
know not,] The name of the higher, or highest,<br>\
land is الرَّمْكَآءُ; said by IAth to be fem. of الأَرْمَكُ.<br>\
