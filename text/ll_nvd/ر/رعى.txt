رَعَتِ المَاشِيَةُ, aor. تَرْعَى, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
رَعْىٌ (S, * Msb, K) and رِعَايَةٌ (K) and مَرْعًى;<br>\
(S, * K, * JM;) and ↓ ارتعت, and ↓ ترعّت; (K;)<br>\
The cattle [pastured, or] pastured by themselves.<br>\
(Msb.) And رَعَتِ المَاشِيَةُ الكَلَأَ, inf. n. رَعْىٌ<br>\
(Mgh, TA) and رِعَايَةٌ [and مَرْعًى]; and ↓ ارتعت,<br>\
and ↓ ترعّت; [The cattle pastured upon, or depastured, the herbage;] all signifying the same:<br>\
(TA:) and of a camel you say, رَعَى الكَلَأَ بِنَفْسِهِ,<br>\
inf. n. رَعْىٌ [&amp;c., He pastured upon, or depastured, the herbage by himself]; and in like manner ↓ ارتعى. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The saying of &#39;Áïsheh<br>\
فَإِنْ كَانَتْ تَرْعَى مَا هُنَالِكَ is an allusion to the<br>\
feeling, or touching, of the فَرْج itself. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  رَعْىٌ also signifies The keeping, or tending,<br>\
animals; pasturing, or feeding, them; and defending them from the enemy. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
You say, رَعَيْتُ الإِبِلَ, (S,) or المَاشِيَةَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
or الغَنَمَ, (MA,) aor. أَرْعَاهَا, (S, Msb,) inf. n. رَعْىٌ<br>\
(S, MA) [and رِعَايَةٌ, as appears from a phrase<br>\
mentioned below,] and رِعْيَةٌ, (MA,) or this last is<br>\
a simple subst. from this verb, (K,) I [kept, or<br>\
tended, or] pastured, (MA, Msb,) or lead to<br>\
pasture, (MA,) the camels, (S,) or the cattle,<br>\
(Msb, K,) or the sheep or goats; (MA;) and<br>\
↓ ارعاها signifies the same as رَعَاهَا. (K.) And<br>\
صِنَاعَتُهُ رِعَايَةُ الإِبِلِ [His habitual work, or occupation, is the tending, or pasturing, of camels].<br>\
(ISd, K.) And فُلَانٌ يَرْعَى أَبِيهِ [Such a<br>\
one tends, or pastures, for his father;] i. e.<br>\
يَرْعَى غَنَمَهُ [tends, or pastures, his father&#39;s sheep<br>\
or goats]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, as also رِعَايَةٌ, The<br>\
keeping or guarding [a person or thing]; being<br>\
mindful or regardful [of him or it]; and managing<br>\
or ruling or governing [him or it]. (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA.) You say, رَعَيْتُهُ I kept, or guarded, him, as<br>\
a ruler or governor, or a prince or commander,<br>\
who manages, conducts, orders, or regulates, the<br>\
affairs of the people: (Msb:) and رَعَى الأَمِيرُ رَعِيَّتَهُ<br>\
[The prince ruled, or governed, his subjects],<br>\
inf. n. رِعَايَةٌ. (S.) And رَعْيًا لَكَ [I beg God&#39;s<br>\
keeping, or guarding, for thee]; meaning رَعَاكَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
May God keep thee, or guard thee. (Har p. 617.)<br>\
And رَعَى أَمْرَهُ, (K,) inf. n. رَعْىٌ (TA) [and رِعَايَةٌ],<br>\
He was mindful, or regardful, of his affair,<br>\
or case; as also امره ↓ راعى, (K, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
مُرَاعَاةٌ. (TA.) And رِعَآءٌ [app. as an inf. n. of<br>\
↓ راعى] signifies The guarding of palm-trees.<br>\
(TA.) فَمَا رَعَوْهَا حَقَّ رِعَايَتِهَا, in the Kur [lvii. 27],<br>\
means But they did not observe it with its right,<br>\
or due, observance; were not mindful, watchful,<br>\
observant, or regardful, of it, in the right, or<br>\
due, manner of being so. (TA.) You say also,<br>\
رَعَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ حُرْمَتَهُ, inf. n. رِعَايَةٌ, (ISk, S,) i. e. 1<br>\
was mindful, regardful, or observant, of his حرمة<br>\
[meaning of what was entitled to reverence, respect, honour, or defence, in his character and<br>\
appertenances]: and in like manner, ↓ مُرَاعَاةٌ<br>\
الحُقُوقِ, mentioned in the S, means The being<br>\
mindful, regardful, or observant, of rights, or<br>\
dues. (PS.) This last phrase is from ↓ رَاعَيْتُهُ,<br>\
inf. n. مُرَاعَاةٌ, (TA,) which means I regarded<br>\
him; had regard, or an eye, to him; or paid<br>\
regard, or consideration, to him; (S, Msb, K,<br>\
TA;) acting, or behaving, well to him; doing<br>\
good to him; or conferring a benefit, or benefits,<br>\
upon him. (K, TA.) [Hence also, فِيهِ كَذَا ↓ رُوعِىَ<br>\
Regard is had, in it, (the meaning of a word or<br>\
phrase,) to such a thing, as alluded to therein.]<br>\
And الأَمْرَ ↓ رَاعَيْتُ, (S, K,) inf. n. مُرَاعَاةٌ, (TA,)<br>\
signifies also I looked to see what would be the<br>\
issue, or result, of the affair, or case. (S, Msb,<br>\
K.) Hence, accord. to Er-Rághib, النُّجُومِ ↓ مُرَاعَاةُ:<br>\
(TA:) you say, رَعَى النُّجُومَ; (S, K;) and ↓ رَاعَاهَا,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. مُرَاعَاةٌ; (TA;) He watched the stars,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) waiting for the time when they would<br>\
disappear. (K, TA.) El-Khansà says,<br>\
↓ أَرْعَى النُّجومَ وَمَا كُلِّفْتُ رِعْيَتَهَا<br>\
وَتَارَةً أَتَغَشَّى فَضْلَ أَطْمَارِى<br>\
[I watch, or I watching, the stars, waiting for<br>\
the time when they will, or would, disappear,<br>\
though I am not, or I was not, tasked with the<br>\
watching of them; and at one time I cover myself, or covering myself, with the redundant parts<br>\
of my old and worn-out garments]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  رِعَايَةٌ<br>\
also signifies The being faithful to an engagement,<br>\
or promise; syn. وَفَآءٌ. (Mgh. [See رَاعٍ, below;<br>\
last sentence.])<br>\
2<br>\
رعّاهُ, inf. n. تَرْعِيَةٌ, He said [of him], رَعَاهُ اللّٰهُ<br>\
[May God keep him, or guard him: or he said<br>\
to him, رَعَاكَ اللّٰهُ May God keep thee, or guard<br>\
thee]. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
راعى الحِمَارُ الحُمُرَ The ass pastured with the<br>\
[other] asses: (S, K:) and in like manner one<br>\
says of camels with wild animals. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  راعت<br>\
الأَرْضُ, a reading required by the context in the<br>\
K, is wrong; the correct phrase being ارعت<br>\
الأَرْضُ [q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 1, in the latter<br>\
half of the paragraph, in eight places. ―<br>\
-b4-  المُرَاعَاةُ is<br>\
also syn. with المُنَاظَرَةُ [app. as meaning The looking towards, or facing, a person or thing: a signification nearly like the last referred to in the<br>\
sentence here immediately preceding]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
See also 4, in three places. ―<br>\
-b6-  وَرِّعِ اللِّصَّ وَلَا تُرَاعِهِ,<br>\
in a trad. of &#39;Omar, means Restrain thou the<br>\
thief, or make him to refrain, from taking thy<br>\
goods, but bear not witness against him: so says<br>\
Lth: or the meaning is, and do not wait for<br>\
him. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
ارعى المَاشِيَةَ i. q. رَعَاهَا: see 1, in the former<br>\
half of the paragraph. Said of God, it means He<br>\
caused to grow, for the cattle, that upon which<br>\
they might pasture. (S.) One says also ارعت<br>\
الأَرْضُ, [as though المَاشِيَةَ or the like were understood] The land abounded [as though it fed abundantly] with herbage: (Zj, K:) راعت الأَرْضُ, in<br>\
this sense [as stated above, see 3,] is wrong. (TA.)<br>\
And ارعاهُ المَكَانَ He made the place to be a<br>\
pasturage for him. (ISd, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَرعَيْتُهُ سَمْعِى<br>\
means I made my ear, or ears, to be mindful of<br>\
his speech: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or I gave ear,<br>\
hearkened, or listened, to him. (S, Msb.) You<br>\
say, أَرْعِنِى سَمْعَكَ, (Msb, K,) and ↓ رَاعِنِى, i. e.<br>\
Hearken thou, or listen thou, to my speech. (K.)<br>\
Hence ↓ رَاعِنَا in the Kur [ii. 98 and iv. 48]: Akh<br>\
says that it is of the form فَاعِلْنَا from المُرَاعَاةُ, and<br>\
means أَرْعِنَا سَمْعَكَ; the ى having gone away<br>\
because it is an imperative: he says also that it<br>\
is read رَاعِنًا, as an objective complement, from<br>\
الرُّعُونَةُ: (S: [see art. رعن:]) the reading in Ibn-Mes&#39;ood&#39;s copy of the Kur-án is رَاعُونَا. (TA.)<br>\
You say also, هُوَ لَا يُرْعِى إِلَى قَوْلِ أَحَدٍ He will<br>\
not pay any regard, or attention, to the saying<br>\
of any one. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And أَرْعَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ I showed<br>\
mercy to him [by sparing him, or letting him<br>\
live, or by pardoning him, or otherwise]; had<br>\
mercy on him; pitied, or compassionated, him;<br>\
syn. أَبْقَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ and تَرَحَّمْتُهُ. (S, K.) Aboo-Dahbal says,<br>\
إِنْ كَانَ هٰذَا السِّحْرُ مِنْكِ فَلَا<br>\
تُرْعِى عَلَىَّ وَجَدِّدِى سِحْرَا<br>\
[app. meaning If this enchantment be from thee,<br>\
then spare me not, but renew enchantment].<br>\
(TA. [It seems to be there cited as an instance<br>\
of the verb&#39;s having a second objective complement; (for which I see no reason;) following<br>\
the assertion that one says, أَرْعَى عَلَيْهِ كَذَا, signifying ابقى; and that the verb is made trans. by<br>\
means of على as properly meaning ارعاه متطلعا<br>\
عليه: but I doubt not that the correct reading is<br>\
أَرْعَاهُ مُطَّلِعًا عَلَيْهِ, i. e. He showed mercy to him,<br>\
coming to him, or getting sight and knowledge of<br>\
him.]) ↓ المُرَاعَآةُ, also, [or المُرَاعَاةُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ,]<br>\
signifies الإِبْقَآءُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ. (TA.)<br>\

تَرَعَّىَ see 1, first and second sentences.<br>\
8<br>\
إِرْتَعَىَ see 1, in three places, first two sentences.<br>\
10<br>\
استرعى [app. signifies He desired cattle to<br>\
pasture: and hence, he left them to pasture<br>\
alone]. You say, اِسْتَرْعَيْتُ مَالِىَ القَمَرَ, meaning<br>\
I left my cattle to pasture without a pastor to<br>\
take care of them in the night: and [in like<br>\
manner,] استرعيتهُ الشَّمْسَ, in the day. (TA in<br>\
art. قمر.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اِسْتَرْعَيْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ (S, K *) I asked him,<br>\
or desired him, to keep or guard, or be mindful<br>\
of or regardful of, the thing. (K, * TA.) Hence<br>\
the prov., مَنِ اسْتَرْعَى الذِّئْبَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ [He who<br>\
asks, or desires, the wolf to keep guard does<br>\
wrong]; (S, TA;) i. e. he who trusts in one who<br>\
is treacherous puts trust in a wrong place. (TA.)<br>\
[And hence also,] اِسْتَرْعَى الأَسْمَاعَ لِخُطْبَتِهِ He<br>\
asked, or desired, the ears [meaning the hearers]<br>\
to mind his discourse, or oration. (Har p. 361.)<br>\
رِعْىٌ and ↓ مَرْعًى Pasture, or herbage; (S,<br>\
Mgh, K;) the food of beasts: (Msb:) pl. of the<br>\
former أَرْعَآءٌ [meaning kinds, or sorts, of pasture<br>\
or herbage]: (K:) and of ↓ the latter مَرَاعٍ.<br>\
(Msb.) It is said in a prov., وَلَا كَالسَّعْدَانِ ↓ مَرْعًى<br>\
[Pasture, but not like the سعدان: see art. سعد].<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رِعْىُ الحَمَامِ وَالإِبِلِ A certain herb, having<br>\
berries like myrtle-berries, in which is the least<br>\
degree of sweetness; not injurious to the camels<br>\
that feed upon it, but poison to [venomous or<br>\
noxious reptiles or the like, such as are termed]<br>\
هَوَامّ: the decoction thereof blackens the hair.<br>\
(Ibn-Seenà, book ii. p. 252.)<br>\
رِعْيَةٌ a subst. from 1 in the first of the senses<br>\
mentioned in this art.; i. e. [The act of cattle&#39;s<br>\
pasturing, or their pasturing alone,] from رَعَتِ<br>\
المَاشِيَةُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also The act, or occupation,<br>\
of keeping or tending, or of pasturing or feeding,<br>\
animals.] You say [of a man], يُجِيدُ رِعْيَةَ الإِبِلِ<br>\
[He performs well the act of keeping or tending,<br>\
or of pasturing or feeding, camels]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[And The act of watching, and waiting for the<br>\
time of the disappearance, of the stars.] See a<br>\
verse cited near the end of the first paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  Also Land in which are projecting stones that<br>\
impede the plough. (K, TA.)<br>\
رَعْوَى and رُعْوَى: see the next paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Both seem to be also substs. from أَرْعَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ;<br>\
and thus to be syn. with بَقْوَى and بُقْوَى; and in<br>\
like manner, ↓ رُعْيَا is probably syn. with بُقْيَا:<br>\
the radical ى being changed into و as it is in<br>\
بقوى.] You say, مَا لِى عَلَيْهِ رَعْوَى وَلَا بَقْوَى [I<br>\
have no mercy nor pity to bestow upon him].<br>\
(JK in art. بقى. [See بُقْيَا.]) See also 1 in art.<br>\
رعو [from which رَعْوَى in this phrase may also<br>\
with reason be regarded as derivable].<br>\
رُعْيَا a subst. from رَعَى as used in the phrase<br>\
رَعَى أَمْرَهُ [expl. in the first paragraph; thus signifying Mindfulness, regardfulness, or observance,<br>\
of an affair, or a case]; as also ↓ رَعْوَى and ↓ رُعْوَى.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
And see art. رعو.<br>\
[<br>\
رَعِىٌّ Pastured: ruled, or governed: and kept,<br>\
or guarded: so accord. to Golius, as on the authority of the KL; but not in my copy of that work.<br>\
It is agreeable with analogy as syn. with مَرْعِىٌّ:<br>\
and from it is formed the subst. next following.]<br>\
رَعِيَّةٌ [with ة affixed لِلنَّقْلِ, i. e., to transfer the<br>\
word from the category of epithets to that of<br>\
substantives,] Cattle pasturing, or pasturing by<br>\
themselves: and cattle kept, tended, or pastured:<br>\
(K, TA:) pl. رَعَايَا: (TA:) this latter (the pl.)<br>\
signifies cattle kept, tended, or pastured, for any<br>\
one; (K, TA;) for the subjects and for the<br>\
Sultán; (TA;) as also ↓ رَعَاوِيَّةٌ: (K, TA: in<br>\
some copies of the K رَعَاوِيَة, without teshdeed:)<br>\
and ↓ أَرْعَاوِيَّةٌ signifies cattle kept, tended, or<br>\
pastured, for the Sultán, (K, TA,) especially,<br>\
and upon which are his brands and marks. (TA.)<br>\
Hence the trad., كُلُّ رَاعٍ مَسْؤُولٌ عِنْ رَعِيَّتِهِ [Every<br>\
pastor shall be questioned respecting his pastured<br>\
cattle: or every ruler shall be questioned respecting his subjects; agreeably with what follows].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The people ruled or governed; the subjects of a ruler or governor: (Msb, K:) the<br>\
community; the people in common or in general;<br>\
or the common people: (S:) [any persons or<br>\
person, and things or thing, in the keeping, or<br>\
under the guardianship or rule or government, of<br>\
a man or woman:] see رَاعٍ, in the latter half of<br>\
the paragraph: pl. as above. (TA.)<br>\
رعاءة الخَيْلِ: see رَاعِيَةٌ.<br>\
رَعَاوَى and رُعَاوَى Camels that pasture around<br>\
the people and their dwellings (S, K) because they<br>\
are those upon which they work [or perform their<br>\
business]: (S:) but in the Tekmileh it is written<br>\
↓ رُعَاوِيَّةٌ, as meaning cattle that pasture around<br>\
the dwellings of the people. (TA.)<br>\
رَعَاوِيَّةٌ: see رَعِيَّةٌ.<br>\
رُعَاوِيَّةٌ: see رَعَاوَى.<br>\
رَاعٍ [act. part. n. of 1]. You say مَاشِيَةٌ رَاعِيَةٌ<br>\
Cattle [pasturing, or] pasturing by themselves:<br>\
(Msb:) pl. رَوَاعِى [a mistranscription for رَوَاعٍ].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَاعِى البُسْتَانِ and الأُتُنِ ↓ رَاعِيَةُ are names<br>\
of Two species of جَنَادِب [or locusts]; (K;) the<br>\
latter mentioned by ISd: Sgh says that the former<br>\
is a large جُنْدَب: and the latter is another species,<br>\
that does not fly. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  رَاعٍ also signifies A<br>\
keeper, or guarder, (TA,) or pastor, (Msb,) of<br>\
cattle: (Msb, TA:) an epithet in which the<br>\
quality of a subst. is predominant: (TA:) pl.<br>\
رُعَاةٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) but this is said to be mostly<br>\
used as pl. of رَاعٍ in another sense as will be<br>\
shown below, (TA,) and رِعَآءٌ [and app. رُعَآءٌ (mentioned below)] and رُعْيَانٌ; (S, Msb, TA;) and<br>\
رُعَاةٌ has a pl., namely, رُعًى. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,]<br>\
الرَّاعِى is the name of The star [a] that is upon<br>\
the head of الحَوَّآء [i. e. Ophiuchus]: that which<br>\
is upon the head of الحاوى [a mistranscription in<br>\
my MS. for الجَاثِى, i. e. Hercules, the star a,]<br>\
being called كَلْبُ الرَّاعِى. (Kzw.) Also The star<br>\
[<br>\
γ] that is upon the left leg of Cepheus: between<br>\
whose legs is a star [app. K] that is called كَلْبُ<br>\
الرَّاعِى: (Kzw:) [from their longitudes it seems<br>\
that these two stars are the same as are meant by<br>\
what here follows:] الكَلْبُ [or كَلْبُ الرَّاعِى] is a<br>\
certain star over against الدَّلْو [or Aquarius,<br>\
which latter is] below; in the path of which is a<br>\
red [or perhaps another (آخَر instead of أَحْمَر)]<br>\
star, called الرَّاعِى. (TA in art. كلب.) [And<br>\
accord. to Freytag, رَاعِى الجَوْزَآءِ is the name of<br>\
A star otherwise called the Foot of Orion: and<br>\
رَاعِى النَّعَائِمِ, the name of The star<br>\
λ in Sagittarius: see Ideler&#39;s “ Untersuch. über den Ursprung etc. der Sternnamen,” to which he refers,<br>\
pp. 213, 226, for the former; and p. 187 for the<br>\
latter.] ―<br>\
-b5-  [And hence,] رَاعٍ signifies also A ruler,<br>\
or governor, (S, K,) or prince, or commander,<br>\
(Msb,) who manages, conducts, orders, or regulates, the affairs of a people: (Msb, K:) and a<br>\
ruler, or governor, of himself: (TA:) pl. رُعَاةٌ<br>\
and رُعْيَانٌ, (K,) but it is said that the former is<br>\
mostly used as meaning rulers, or governors, and<br>\
the latter as pl. of رَاعٍ in relation to sheep or goats<br>\
[or the like], (TA,) and رِعَآءٌ and رُعَآءٌ. (K.) It is<br>\
said in a trad., كُلُّكُمْ رَاعٍ وَكُلُّكُمْ مَسْؤُولٌ عِنْ<br>\
↓ رَعِيَّتِهِ [Every one of you is a ruler, or governor,<br>\
and every one of you shall be questioned respecting<br>\
those, or that, of which he is ruler or governor]:<br>\
such is the man in respect of his family, and in<br>\
respect of the property of his father; and the<br>\
servant in respect of the property of his master;<br>\
and the wife is a رَاعِيَة in respect of the house, or<br>\
tent, of her husband: and every one of these shall<br>\
be questioned respecting his, or her, رَعِيَّة. (ElJámi&#39; es-Sagheer of Es-Suyootee.) And one says,<br>\
كَالرَّاعِى ↓ لَيْسَ المَرْعِىُّ [The ruled, or governed,<br>\
is not like the ruler, or governor]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b6-  In the<br>\
saying of El-Karkhee, بَاعَ طَيْرًا عَلَى أَنَّهُ رَاعٍ, relating to [carrier-] pigeons, it is from الرِّعَايَةُ<br>\
signifying الوَفَآءُ; [the saying meaning He sold<br>\
birds on the condition of their being such as would<br>\
be faithful to their charge;] for pigeons in El-<br>\
&#39;Irák and Syria are bought for high prices, and<br>\
sent from distant points with letters of informations, and convey them, and bring back replies to<br>\
them. (Mgh, JM.)<br>\
رَاعِيَةٌ [fem. of رَاعٍ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also a subst. formed from<br>\
the latter word by the affix ة; like رَعِيَّةٌ from<br>\
رَعِىٌّ]: see راعٍ, third sentence. ―<br>\
-b3-  الرَّاعِيَةُ is the<br>\
name of A certain bird: (TA:) [and] so is<br>\
رَاعِيَةُ الخَيْلِ; (TA, and thus in some copies of the<br>\
K;) thus correctly written, as in the Tekmileh;<br>\
in [some of] the copies of the K, راعية الجبل;<br>\
[perhaps the same as the former bird;] a yellow<br>\
bird, that is found beneath the bellies of horses or<br>\
similar beasts; thus in the Tekmileh; said by ISh<br>\
to be a small bird like the sparrow, that alights<br>\
beneath the bellies of the horses and other beasts,<br>\
yellow, as though its neck and wings were tinged<br>\
with saffron, its back having upon it a dinginess,<br>\
or duskiness, and blackness, its head being yellow,<br>\
and its زِمِكَّى [or tail] being neither long nor<br>\
short; accord. to Sgh, also called الخيل ↓ رعاءة.<br>\
(TA [thus written without any syll. signs: if<br>\
applying to the species in the manner of a coll.<br>\
gen. n., perhaps a mistranscription for رُعَاةُ الخَيْلِ].)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  رَاعِيَةُ الشَّيْبِ, and رَوَاعِى الشَّيْبِ, (tropical:)  The commencement of hoariness, (K, TA,) and the first<br>\
marks thereof. (TA.)<br>\
أَرْعَى [app. More, and most, merciful or compassionate; from أَرْعَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ, though by rule it<br>\
should be formed from an unaugmented verb<br>\
accord. to many of the grammarians: ―<br>\
-b2-  and<br>\
hence, being nearly syn. with أَرْفَقُ in the primary<br>\
sense, syn. with this latter, or nearly so, in a<br>\
secondary sense]. You say, أَمْرُ كَذَا أَرْفَقُ بِى<br>\
وَأَرْعَى عَلَىَّ [app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  This affair is more,<br>\
or most, easy and convenient to me]. (TA.)<br>\
أُرْعُوَّةٌ The yoke that is placed upon the necks of<br>\
the two bulls employed in ploughing; (AA, Sgh,<br>\
K, TA;) of the dial. of Azd-Shanoo-ah. (TA.)<br>\
أَرْعَاوِيَّةٌ: see رَعِيَّةٌ.<br>\
تِرْعِىٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
تِرْعِيَّةٌ and تُرْعِيَّةٌ (Fr, S, ISd, K) and تَرْعِيَّةٌ,<br>\
