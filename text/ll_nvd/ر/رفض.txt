the Prophet; (Mgh, Msb;) for they had promised<br>\
allegiance to Zeyd the son of &#39;Alee (As, O, L, K)<br>\
the son of El-Hoseyn the son of &#39;Alee the son of<br>\
Aboo-Tálib, (As, O, L,) and then desired him to<br>\
renounce the two elders, [Aboo-Bekr and &#39;Omar,<br>\
(TK,)] and on his refusing to do so they deserted<br>\
him: (As, O, L, K:) الأَرْفَاضُ is also applied to<br>\
