رَشَدَ, aor.<br>\
رَشُدَ; and رَشِدَ, aor.<br>\
رَشَدَ; (S, A, L,<br>\
Msb, K;) the former of which is the better known<br>\
and the more chaste; (TA;) inf. n. رُشْدٌ, (S, L,<br>\
Msb, K,) which is of the former, (S, L,) and<br>\
رَشَدٌ, (S, L, Msb, K,) which is of the latter, (S,<br>\
L, Msb,) and رَشَادٌ, (L, K,) which is also of the<br>\
latter verb, (TA,) or this last is a simple subst.;<br>\
(Msb;) He took, or followed, a right way or<br>\
course or direction; (S, A, L, Msb, K;) as to a<br>\
road, and also as to an affair: (L:) [and often<br>\
relating to religion; meaning he held a right<br>\
belief; was orthodox:] and ↓ استرشد signifies the<br>\
same: (L, K:) you say, استرشد لِأَمْرِهِ, meaning<br>\
He took, or followed, a right way to conduct his<br>\
affair: and رَشَدَ أَمْرَهُ, meaning He took, or followed, a right course in his affair; this latter<br>\
being a phrase similar to أَلِمَ بَطْنَهُ and سَفِهَ رَأْيَهُ<br>\
&amp;c. (L.) Some say that رَشْدٌ relates to the things<br>\
of the present life and to those of the life to come;<br>\
and رَشَدٌ, only to those of the life to come: but<br>\
this distinction does not accord with what has<br>\
been heard from the Arabs, nor with readings of<br>\
the Kur-án, in which some read رُشْد and others<br>\
رَشَد in several verses. (MF.) The former also<br>\
signifies The continuing in the way of truth, or<br>\
the right way, with self-constraining firmness in<br>\
so doing. (K.) One says to the traveller, رَشِدْتَ<br>\
[Mayest thou take, or follow, the right way].<br>\

discretion, when he was able of himself to take,<br>\
or follow, a right way or course: a phrase of<br>\
frequent occurrence.]<br>\
