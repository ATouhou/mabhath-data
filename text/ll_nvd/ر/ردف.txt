رَدِفَهُ, (T, S, O, Msb, K &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
رَدَفَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. رَدْفٌ, (MA, KL,) He rode behind him [on<br>\
the same beast]; (AZ, Sh, Zj, T, MA, Msb;) [and]<br>\
so رَدَفَهُ, [aor.<br>\
رَدُفَ;] (M;) and ↓ اردفهُ; (AZ, Sh, T,<br>\
M;) said by IAar to signify the same as رَدِفَهُ:<br>\
(T:) [or, in other words,] رَدِفَهُ signifies he became<br>\
to him a رِدْف [meaning a رَدِيف]; and so رَدِفَ لَهُ;<br>\
for the Arabs often add the ل with a trans. v.<br>\
that governs an accus. noun; so that they say,<br>\
سَمِعَ لَهُ and شَكَرَ لَهُ and نَصَحَ لَهُ, meaning سَمِعَهُ<br>\
and شَكَرَهُ and نَصَحَهُ: (Fr, T:) [and also] he, or<br>\
it, followed, or came after, him, or it; (S, O, K,<br>\
and Ham p. 148;) and so رَدِفَ لَهُ; (Ham ibid.;)<br>\
and رَدَفَهُ, aor.<br>\
رَدُفَ; (K;) and ↓ اردفهُ; (S, K, and<br>\
Ham ubi suprà;) and ↓ ارتدفهُ also signifies the<br>\
same as رَدِفَهُ; (K;) رَدِفَهُ and ↓ اردفهُ being like<br>\
تَبِعَهُ and أَتْبَعَهُ in [form and] meaning: (S:)<br>\
[↓ رَدَّفَهُ, likewise, appears to be syn. with رَدِفَهُ;<br>\
or, probably, رُدِّفَهُ, which seems to signify lit. he<br>\
was made to ride behind him; &amp;c.; for it is said<br>\
that] the inf. n. تَرْدِيفٌ signifies the coming, or<br>\
going, behind; as also تَرْدَافٌ: (KL:) and رَدِفْتُهُ<br>\
also signifies I overtook him and outwent him.<br>\
(Msb: [explained in my copy by لحقته وسبقته:<br>\
but I think that سبقته is a mistranscription for<br>\
تَبِعْتُهُ; and that the meaning therefore is, I overtook him and followed him.]) One says, كَانَ نَزَلَ<br>\
بِهِمْ أَمْرٌ فَرَدِفَ لَهُمْ آخَرُ أَعْظَمُ مِنْهُ [An event had<br>\
befallen them, and another, of greater magnitude<br>\
than it, happened afterwards to them]. (Lth, *<br>\
T, * S, O.) And أَمْرٌ ↓ اردفهُ is a dial. var. of رَدِفَهُ,<br>\
meaning An event happened to him afterwards:<br>\
(S, O:) or رَدِفَهُمُ الأَمْرُ and ↓ أَرْدَفَهُم signify the<br>\
event came upon them suddenly, or unexpectedly;<br>\
or came upon them so as to overwhelm them.<br>\
(M.) It is said in the Kur [xxvii. 74], عَسَى أَنْ<br>\
يَكُونَ رَدِفَ لَكُمْ بَعْضُ الَّذِى تَسْتَعْجِلُونَ, meaning<br>\
[Perhaps a portion of that which ye desire to<br>\
hasten] may have drawn near to you; (Yoo, Fr,<br>\
T, O,) as though the ل were introduced because<br>\
the meaning is دَنَا لَكُمْ: or it may mean يَكُونَ<br>\
رَدِفَكُمْ [may have become close behind you]; (Fr,<br>\
T, O;) the ل being introduced for a reason mentioned above, as in سَمِعَ لَهُ &amp;c. for سَمِعَهُ &amp;c.:<br>\
(Fr, T:) El-Aaraj read رَدَفَ لكم. (O.) And<br>\
Khuzeymeh Ibn-Málik Ibn-Nahd says,<br>\
الثُّرَيَّا ↓ إِذَا الجَوْزَآءُ أَرْدَفَتِ<br>\
ظَنَنْتُ بِآلِ فَاطِمَةَ الظُّنُونَا<br>\
[When Orion, or Gemini, shall ride behind, or<br>\
closely follow, the Pleiades, (an event which will<br>\
never occur,) I will form in my mind, respecting<br>\
the family (meaning the father) of Fátimeh, opinions]: (S, O:) cited by Fr [and by J] as an ex.<br>\
of اردفت in the sense of رَدِفَت: (T:) he means<br>\
Fátimeh the daughter of Yedhkur Ibn-&#39;Anazeh,<br>\
who [i. e. Yedhkur] was one of the قَارِظَان. (S,<br>\
O. [Respecting the قارظان, see art. قَرظ.])<br>\

رادفت الدَّابَّةُ The beast allowed a رَدِيف [to<br>\
ride it], and was strong enough to bear him; as<br>\
also ↓ اردفت [accord. to some]. (Msb.) You say,<br>\
هَذِهِ دَابَّةٌ لَا تُرَادِفُ (T, S, M, O, K) and ↓ لَا تُرْدِفُ,<br>\
(Lth, M, O, K,) but the latter is rare, (K,) or<br>\
post-classical, of the language of the people of<br>\
towns and villages, (T, O,) and not allowable,<br>\
(T,) This beast will not allow a رَدِيف (Lth, T, M)<br>\
to ride it; (Lth, T;) will not bear a رديف. (S,<br>\
O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مُرَادَفَةُ الجَرَادِ signifies The mounting<br>\
of [locusts one behind, or upon, another;] the<br>\

-b3-  And مُرَادَفَةُ المُلُوكِ is<br>\
[a phrase meaning The acting as a رِدْف, or as<br>\
أَرْدَاف, to the kings,] from الرِّدَافَةُ [q. v.]. (O, K.)<br>\

pertained the رِدَافَة in the Time of Ignorance, says,<br>\
رَبَعْنَا وَرَادَفْنَا المُلُوكَ فَظَلِّلُوا<br>\
وطَابَ الأَحَالِيبِ الثُّمَامَ المُنَزَّعَا<br>\
[We have taken the fourth part of the spoils, and<br>\
we have acted as أَرْدَاف to the kings; therefore<br>\

grass plucked up, and so make it cool for us]:<br>\
(S, * O:) وِطَاب is the pl. of the وَطْب of milk.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [In the conventional language of lexicology, رادفهُ, inf. n. مُرَادَفَةٌ, signifies It was<br>\
synonymous with it; i. e. a word with another<br>\
word: as though the former supplied the place of<br>\
the latter, like as the رِدْف supplied the place of<br>\
the king. See also 6.]<br>\

I made him to ride (Sh, Zj, T, S, Msb) behind<br>\
me, (Sh, * Zj, T, Msb,) or with me, (S,) on the<br>\
back of the [same] beast; and so ↓ اِرْتَدَفْتُهُ:<br>\
(Msb:) or ↓ ارتدفهُ signifies he placed him behind<br>\
him on the beast: (M:) and أَرْدَفْتُهُ مَعَهُ I made<br>\

And ترادف الشَّىْءُ The thing was, or became, consecutive in its parts; one part of the thing followed another. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also a word alluding to a certain foul act: (M, O:) from الرِّدْفُ<br>\
signifying العَجُزُ. (M.) You say, (of two boys,<br>\
or young men, TK,) تَرَادَفَا meaning تَنَاكَحَا. (K.)<br>\

Ks as meaning أَخَذْنَاهُ &amp;c. as above [i. e. We<br>\

assistants, or auxiliaries; (S, K;) [as being a man&#39;s<br>\

is fatigued, another takes his place: (S:) or, as<br>\
some say, رُدَافَى is syn. with رَدِيفٌ: (T:) or it is<br>\

الرِّدَافَةُ The function of the رِدْف of a king, (S,<br>\
O, K,) in the Time of Ignorance: (S: [see<br>\
رِدْفٌ:]) a term similar to الخِلَافَةُ: (K:) it pertained to the Benoo-Yarbooa, in that time; because<br>\
there were not among the Arabs any who waged<br>\
war more than they did against the kings of El-<br>\
Heereh, who therefore made peace with them on<br>\
the condition that the ردافة should be assigned to<br>\
them and that they should abstain from waging<br>\
war against the people of El-&#39;Irák: (S, O:) it<br>\

lexicology, A synonym of a word or expression.<br>\
(Mz, 27th نوع.) [See 3, last signification: and<br>\
see also مُتَرَادِفُ.]<br>\
مُرْتَدِفٌ: see رَدِيفٌ, first sentence.<br>\
مُتَرَادِفٌ, as a conventional term in lexicology,<br>\
Synonymous: you say أَلْفَاظٌ مُتَرَادِفَةٌ synonymous<br>\

explained in the K by the words أَنْ يَكُونَ اسْمًا<br>\
لِشّىْءٍ وَاحِدٍ, meaning significant of one thing;<br>\
which is the contr. of مُشْتَرَكٌ, i. e. “ homonymous: ” and in like manner, المُتَرَادِفَةُ is expl.<br>\
in the O, ان تكون أَسْمَآءً لشىءٍ واحدٍ; and is said<br>\
to be post-classical.] مُتَرَادِفَاتٌ [its pl. when used<br>\
as a subst.] signifies Synonyms; i. e. single, or<br>\
simple, words denoting the same thing considered<br>\
in one and the same respect or light: thus the<br>\
مُتَرَادِفَانِ differ from the noun and the definition<br>\
[thereof], because these [generally] are not both<br>\
single words; and from the مُتَبَايِنَانِ [or “ two<br>\
disparates ”] such as السَّيْفُ and الصَّارِمُ, because<br>\
these denote the same thing considered in two different respects, the one in respect of the substance,<br>\
and the other in respect of the quality: (Fakhred-Deen [Er-Rázee] in the Mz, 27th نوع:) or<br>\
they may be two simple words, as اللَّيْثُ and الأَسَدُ;<br>\
and two compound expressions, as, جُلُوسُ اللَّيْثِ<br>\
and قُعُودُ الأَسَدِ; and a single word and a compound<br>\
expression, as المُزُّ and الحُلْوُ الحَامِضُ. (Kull<br>\
p. 130.) [See also مُرَادِفُ لَفْظٍ.]<br>\
