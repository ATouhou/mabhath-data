↓ رَهْبَةٌ: (S, K:) or it is originally from الرَّهْبَةُ;<br>\

on the supposition that the ن is a radical letter:<br>\
(IAth, TA:) or it signifies excess in religious<br>\
services or exercises, and discipline, and the<br>\
detaching oneself from mankind; and is from<br>\
رَهْبَانُ, signifying “excessively fearful:” so in the<br>\

(Bd,) meaning وَابْتَدَعُوا رَهْبَانِيَّةً ابْتَدَعُوهَا [And<br>\
they innovated excess &amp;c.: they innovated it]:<br>\
(AAF, Bd, TA:) and some read with damm,<br>\
[رُهْبَانِيَّةً,] as though from رُهْبَانٌ, pl. of رَاهِبٌ.<br>\
(Bd.) It is said in a trad., (TA,) لَا رَهْبَانِيَّةَ فِى<br>\
الإِسْلَامِ [There is no monkery in El-Islám]; i. e.,<br>\
no such thing as the making oneself a eunuch, and<br>\
putting chains upon one&#39;s neck, and wearing garments of hair-cloth, and abstaining from flesh-meat, and the like. (K.) And in another trad.,<br>\
عَلَيْكُمْ بِالْجِهَادِ فَإِنَّهُ رُهْبَانِيَّةُ أُمَّتِى [Keep ye to the<br>\
waging of war against the unbelievers, for it is<br>\

the tongue of the dog: (TA:) or a certain cartilage, resembling the tongue, suspended in the lower<br>\
part of the breast, impending over the belly:<br>\

caution; or a cautious fearer;] as in the phrase<br>\
هُوَ رَاهِبٌ مِنَ اللّٰهِ [He is one who fears God; or a<br>\
fearer of God; &amp;c.]: whence the signification<br>\
next following. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A Christian [monk,<br>\
ascetic, religious recluse, or] devotee; (Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
one who devotes himself to religious services or<br>\
exercises, in a صَوْمَعَة [or cell]; (TA;) one of the<br>\
رُهْبَان of the Christians: (S, K:) [i. e.] the pl. is<br>\
رُهْبَانٌ (A, Mgh, Msb) and رَهَبَةٌ; (A;) or, sometimes, رُهْبَانٌ is a sing.; (K;) as in the following<br>\
ex., cited by IAar:<br>\
لَوْ كَلَّمَتْ رُهْبَانَ دَيْرٍ فِى القُلَلْ<br>\
لَانْحَدَرَ الرُّهْبَانُ يَسْعَى فَنَزَلْ<br>\
[If she spoke to a Christian monk in a monastery<br>\
among the summits of a mountain, the Christian<br>\
monk would come down running, and so descend]:<br>\
but he says that the approved way is to use it as<br>\
a pl.: (TA:) and رَهَابِينُ is a pl. (A, Msb, K) of<br>\
رُهْبَانٌ, (K,) and رَهَابِنَةٌ is another pl. (A, K) of<br>\
the same, and so is رُهْبَانُونَ. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
مَرْهُوبٌ.<br>\
رَاهِبَةٌ A state, or condition, that frightens. (TA.)<br>\
أَرْهَابٌ Birds that are not rapacious; that do<br>\
not prey. (K.) [App. so called because timid; as<br>\
Golius supposes.]<br>\
مُرَهِّبٌ, applied to a she-camel, [though of a<br>\
masc. form,] Fatigued in her back. (TA. [See<br>\
its verb, 2.])<br>\
مَرْهُوبٌ Feared: (Mgh, Msb:) [or feared with<br>\
caution:] applied to God. (Msb.) In the phrase<br>\
لَبَّيْكَ مَرْهُوبٌ وَمَرْغُوبٌ إِلَيْكَ [At thy service time<br>\
after time: Thou art feared, and petitioned, or<br>\
supplicated with humility, &amp;c.], it is in the nom.<br>\
case as the enunciative of an inchoative [أَنْتَ]<br>\
suppressed. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] المَرْهُوبُ, as also<br>\
↓ الرَّاهِبُ, [the latter in this case being like رَاضٍ<br>\
in the sense of مَرْضِىٌّ,] The lion. (K.)<br>\
