رَدَّهُ, (S, M, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
رَدَ3َ, (S, M, L,)<br>\
inf. n. رَدٌّ (S, M, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and مَرَدٌّ (S, M,<br>\
L, K) and مَرْدُودٌ, (S, L, K,) this last an inf. n.<br>\
like مَحْلُوفٌ and مَعْقُولٌ, (S, L,) and رِدَّةٌ (S [there<br>\
said to be an inf. n., like رَدٌّ of رَدَّهُ, aor.<br>\
رَدُ3َ,]) and<br>\
رِدِّيدَى, (S, L, K, [but in the S and L merely said<br>\
to be syn. with رَدٌّ,]) an intensive form, (Mgh,<br>\
TA,) and تَرْدَادٌ, which is [also] an intensive or a<br>\
frequentative inf. n. of رَدَّهُ, (Sb, M, L,) and likewise an inf. n. of ردّدهُ; (Sb, S, M, L;) and<br>\
↓ ارتدّهُ; (M, L;) He made, or caused, him, or<br>\
it, to return, go back, come back, or revert; sent,<br>\
turned, or put, him, or it, back, or away; returned, rejected, repelled, or averted, him, or it;<br>\
syn. رَجَعَهُ, (S, M, L, Msb,) and صَرَفَهُ, (S, M, L,<br>\
K) and دَفَعَهُ; (Msb in art. دفع, &amp;c.;) عَنْ وَجْهِهِ<br>\
[from his, or its, course]. (S, M.) Hence, in the<br>\
Kur [xxx. 42 and xlii. 46], يَوْمٌ لَا مَرَدَّ لَهُ [A day<br>\
which there shall be no repelling, or averting],<br>\
meaning the day of resurrection. (Th, M, L.)<br>\
One says, أَمْرُ اللّٰهِ لَا مَرَدَّ لَهُ The command of God,<br>\
there is no repelling, or averting it. (L.) And<br>\
لَيْسَ لِأَمْرِ اللّٰهِ مَرْدُودٌ i. e. رَدٌّ [There is no repelling,<br>\
or averting, the command of God.] (A.) And<br>\
رَدَّهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ He made him to return or revert,<br>\
or turned him back or away, with gentleness,<br>\
from the thing, or affair; as also لَدَّهُ. (T, L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to some, رَدَّ is made doubly trans.<br>\
with إِلَى to the second objective complement when<br>\
honour is intended to be shown, and with عَلَى<br>\
when dishonour is intended; and they adduce as<br>\
evidence of the correctness of their assertion the<br>\
sayings in the Kur [xxviii. 12] فَرَدَدْنَاهُ إِلَى أُمِّهِ<br>\
[So we returned, or restored, him to his mother]<br>\
and [iii. 142] يَرُدُّوكُمْ عَلَى أَعْقَابِكُمْ [They will turn<br>\
you back, or cause you to return, to your former<br>\
condition]: but instances may be found at variance<br>\
with this assertion. (MF.) [Such instances are<br>\
of frequent occurrence; though in others, the distinction pointed out above is observed, as may be<br>\
seen in what here follows.] You say, رَدَّهُ إِلَى مَنْزِلِهِ<br>\
He sent him back to his abode. (S, L, Msb.) And<br>\
رَدَّ إِلَيْهِ جَوَابًا He returned, or rendered, to him a<br>\
reply, or an answer; (S, A, * L, Msb;) he sent<br>\
to him a reply, or an answer. (Msb.) And<br>\
رَدَّ عَلَيْهِ He replied to him, or answered him, in<br>\
an absolute sense; (L;) and also, by way of<br>\
refutation or objection, i. e. he replied against<br>\
him; فَقَالَ and said, or بِقَوْلِهِ by his saying. (TA<br>\
&amp;c., passim.) And رَدَّ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامَ He returned to<br>\
him the salutation. (The Trads. &amp;c., passim.)<br>\
And رَدَّ عَلَيْهِ الوَدِيعَةَ He returned, rendered, restored, or sent [back], to him the deposite; (Msb;)<br>\
and المَنِيحَةَ [the she-camel, or sheep, or goat, lent to<br>\
him for him to milk her]. (S in art. منح.) And<br>\
رَدَّ عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ, (S, Mgh, L, K,) inf. n. رَدٌّ and مَرَدٌّ,<br>\
(Mgh,) He rejected the thing, (such as a gift, A,<br>\
and bad money, L,) refusing to receive it, or<br>\
accept it, from him; [as though he cast it back<br>\
at him;] and so الشَّىْءَ ↓ رَادَّهُ. (S, L, K. *) And<br>\
in like manner, He rejected the thing in reply to<br>\
him, charging him with error in respect of it.<br>\
(S, L, K.) And رَدَدْتُ عَلَيْهِ قَوْلَهُ [I rebutted, rejected, or repudiated, in reply to him, his saying,<br>\
charging him with error therein; I refused him<br>\
my assent to it]. (A, Msb.) [And رَدَدْتُ قَوْلَهُ<br>\
I rebutted, rejected, or repudiated, in reply, or<br>\
replication, his saying, as wrong, or erroneous;<br>\
refuted it, or refelled it; refused assent to it;<br>\
controverted it, or contradicted it. And رَدَّ الأَمْرَ<br>\
He refused assent, or consent, to the thing, or<br>\
affair. And رَدَّ عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرَ He refused him his<br>\
assent, or consent, to the thing, or affair.] And<br>\
رَدَّ السَّائِلَ He turned back, or away, the beggar,<br>\
or asker, from the object of his want: (A:) [he<br>\
rebuffed him:] or he sent away, or dismissed, the<br>\
beggar, or asker, either with refusal or with a<br>\
gift: occurring in trads. with both of these meanings. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  رَدَّ البَابَ He shut, or closed, the<br>\
door. (Mgh. [See مَرْدُودٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  [رَدَّ يَدَهُ إِلَى سَيْفِهِ<br>\
is a phrase of frequent occurrence, meaning He<br>\
put back his hand to his sword; it being hung<br>\
behind him: (see 4 in art. خلف:) and hence,<br>\
simply, he put his hand to his sword.] فَرَدُّوا<br>\
أَيْدِيَهُمْ فِى أَفْوَاهِهِمْ, in the Kur xiv. 10, means<br>\
And they put their hands to their mouths by<br>\
reason of vehement anger or wrath or rage.<br>\
(Jel.) ―<br>\
-b5-  رَدَّهُ فِى أَمْرٍ [He made him to enter again<br>\
into an affair, or a state]. (ISh, TA in art. نكس.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  رَدَّ الشَّىْءَ He repeated the thing; did it again;<br>\
syn. أَعَادَهُ. (M in art. عود.) You say, رَدَّ عَلَيْهِمُ<br>\
الأَيْمَانَ He repeated to them the oaths. (L in<br>\
art. جلد.) [In this sense, رِدِّيدَى is one of the<br>\
inf. ns. in use; as in the following ex.] It is said<br>\
in a trad., لَا رِدِّيدَى فِى الصَّدَقَةِ [There shall be no<br>\
repeating in the case of the poor-rate]; (T, S, L;)<br>\
meaning that the poor-rate shall not be taken<br>\
twice (T, L) in one year. (L.) [See also 2, which<br>\
has a similar signification.] ―<br>\
-b7-  هٰذَا لَا يَرُدُّ عَلَيْكَ,<br>\
originally لَا يَرُدُّ عَلَيْكَ شَيْئًا (assumed tropical:)  [This will not return<br>\
anything to thee], means [this will not bring any<br>\
return to thee, or] this will not profit thee: (Har<br>\
p. 483:) and مَا يَرُدُّ عَلَيْكَ هٰذَا (tropical:)  This does not<br>\
profit thee. (A.) ―<br>\
-b8-  رَدَّ إِلَيْهِ الأَمْرَ (assumed tropical:)  [He referred<br>\
the affair, or case, to him for management or<br>\
decision: or] he committed to him the affair, or<br>\
case; syn. فَوَّضَهُ إِلَيْهِ. (S and A and K in art.<br>\
فوض.) ―<br>\
-b9-  [رَدَّ الشَّىْءَ إِلَى أَصْلِهِ, a phrase of frequent occurrence, He reduced the thing to its<br>\
original state.] And رَدَّ الرُّبْعَ خُمْسًا [He reduced<br>\
the fourth part to a fifth part]. (K in art. ربع.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b10-  رَدَّ اللّٰهُ نَفْسِى إِلَى وَقْتِ انْتِهَآءِ مُدَّتِى [God<br>\
brought my soul to the time of the end of my<br>\
duration]. (IB, TA in art. امر.) ―<br>\
-b11-  رَدَّهُ إِلَى الأَمْرِ<br>\
[He reduced him to the thing, or affair]: (M<br>\
and K in art. قصر, in explanation of قَصَرَهُ عَلَى<br>\
الأَمْرِ:) or he appropriated him [or it, restrictively,]<br>\
to the thing, or affair. (TK in that art.) ―<br>\
-b12-<br>\
رَدَّ آخِرَ الشَّىْءِ إِلَى أَوَّلِهِ, (S and K in art. عكس, &amp;c,)<br>\
and رَدَّ أَوَّلَهُ عَلَى آخِرِهِ, (Msb in the same art., &amp;c.,)<br>\
[He reversed the thing; made the last part of it<br>\
to be first, and the first part of it to be last;<br>\
turned it hind part before, and fore part behind.]<br>\
And رَدَّ بَعْضَ الأَمْرِ عَلَى بَعْضِ [He reversed the<br>\
order of part, or of the parts, of the affair, or<br>\
case]. (TA in art. رك.) And رَدَدْتُ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرَهُ i. q.<br>\
عَكَسْتُهُ عَلَيْهِ [I reversed to him his affair, or case;<br>\
I made his affair, or case, to become the contrary<br>\
of what it was to him]. (Msb in art. عكس.)<br>\
[Hence,] ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَا لَكُمُ الكَرَّةَ عَلَيْهِمْ, in the Kur<br>\
xvii. 6, means [Then we gave to you] the turn to<br>\
prevail against them, or the victory over them.<br>\
(Bd, Jel.) ―<br>\
-b13-  [Hence, also, رَدَّهُ sometimes signifies He, or it, rendered him, or it; or caused him,<br>\
or it, to become; (like صَيَّرَهُ;) when it has a<br>\
second objective complement the contrary in meaning to the first; as in the following ex.; and it<br>\
may have this meaning likewise when it has a<br>\
second objective complement differing in meaning<br>\
from the first in a less degree.] A poet says,<br>\
رَمَى الحَدَثَانُ نِسْوَةَ آلِ حَرْبٍ<br>\
بِأَمْرٍ قَدْ سَمَدْنَ لَهُ سُمُودَا<br>\
فَرَدَّ شُعُورَهُنَّ السُّودَ بِيضًا<br>\
وَرَدَّ وُجُوهَهُنَّ البِيضَ سُودَا<br>\
[The casualties of fortune smote the women of the<br>\
family of Harb with an event whereat they<br>\
became confounded with great confoundedness;<br>\
and it rendered their black hairs white, and<br>\
rendered their white faces black]. (L in art.<br>\
سمد.)<br>\
2<br>\
ردّدهُ, inf. n. تَرْدِيدٌ and تَرْدَادٌ, (S, L,) [the<br>\
latter of which ns. is merely said in the K to be<br>\
syn. with the former, and is said in the M and L<br>\
to be also an inf. n. of رَدَّ in an intensive or a frequentative sense,] means more than رَدَّهُ; [i. e.<br>\
He made, or caused, him, or it, to return, go<br>\
back, come back, or revert; sent, turned, or put,<br>\
him, or it, back, or away; returned, rejected,<br>\
repelled, or averted, him, or it; much, frequently,<br>\
again and again, or time after time;] having an<br>\
intensive, or a frequentative, signification. (L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Also He, or it, made, or caused, him, or it,<br>\
to go, or move, repeatedly, to and fro; to go and<br>\
come; to reciprocate: see its quasi-pass., 5. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Hence, (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, made him, or caused him, to<br>\
waver, or vacillate, in an affair, or between two<br>\
affairs: see, again, 5. And hence, (assumed tropical:)  He, or it,<br>\
confounded, or perplexed, him, so that he was<br>\
unable to see his right course: see, again, 5; and<br>\
see also مُرَدَّدٌ.] And ردّد الأَمْرَ (assumed tropical:)  [He agitated the<br>\
thing, or affair, to and fro in his mind]. (TA in<br>\
art. نج, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And He repeated it; iterated it:<br>\
[or rather] he repeated it time after time; reiterated it: he reproduced it: he renewed it: syn.<br>\
أَعَادَهُ, (W p. 15,) and كَرَّرَهُ, (A, and W ibid.,)<br>\
and رَجَّعَهُ. (Mgh in art. رجع. [See also 1.])<br>\
You say, ردّد القَوْلَ He repeated the saying time<br>\
after time; reiterated it; syn. كَرَّرَهُ. (A.) [And<br>\
ردّد عَلَيْهِ الكَلَامَ He repeated to him the speech,<br>\
or sentence, time after time; reiterated it to<br>\
him.] And ردّد صَوْتَهُ فِى حَلْقِهِ He reiterated his<br>\
voice in his throat, or fauces; syn. رَجَّعَهُ; (S and<br>\
K in art. رجع, &amp;c.;) [as camels and other animals do in braying; (the Lexicons passim;)<br>\
and he quavered, or trilled, rapidly repeating<br>\
many times one very short note, or each note of a<br>\
piece;] like [as is done in] chanting, [for so the<br>\
Arabs generally do in chanting, and in singing<br>\
and piping, often throughout the whole performance,] (S in that art.,) or in reading or<br>\
reciting, or in singing, or piping, or other performances, of such as are accompanied with<br>\
quavering, or trilling. (TA in that art.)<br>\
3<br>\
رادّهُ, (L and TA in art. رود,) inf. n. مُرَادَدَةٌ,<br>\
(TA in that art.,) or مُرَادَّةٌ, (TK in the present<br>\
art.,) He endeavoured to turn him [from, or to,<br>\
a thing]; syn. رَاجَعَهُ and رَاوَدَهُ. (L in art. رود.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  رادّهُ الشَّىْءَ: see 1, in the former half of the<br>\
paragraph. [Hence,] رادّهُ القَوْلَ [and رادّهُ فِى<br>\
القَوْلِ (occurring in the TA in art. عت)] He<br>\
disputed with him, rebutting, or rejecting, or<br>\
repudiating, in reply to him, what he said; he<br>\
bandied words with him; syn. رَاجَعَهُ. (A.) And<br>\
رادّهُ البَيْعَ He dissolved, or annulled, with him the<br>\
sale; syn. قَايَلَهُ. (A.)<br>\
4<br>\
اردّت She (a sheep or goat or other animal)<br>\
secreted milk in her udder a little before her<br>\
bringing forth; syn. أَضْرَعَتْ: (S:) [or,] said of a<br>\
camel, her udder became shining, and infused<br>\
with milk. (M, L.) And She (a camel) had her<br>\
udder and vulva inflated, or swollen, in consequence of her lying upon moist ground: or had<br>\
her vulva swollen in consequence of lust for the<br>\
stallion: or had her أَرْفَاغ [or groins, or inguinal<br>\
creases, or the like], or her udder, and her vulva,<br>\
swollen in consequence of drinking much water.<br>\
(M, L.) [See also مُردٌّ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And اردّ [said of a<br>\
man, app. from the verb as explained in the first<br>\
sentence of this paragraph, His seminal fluid returned into his back, or he secreted much seminal<br>\
fluid, in consequence of his having been long<br>\
without a wife, or absent from his home: see<br>\
مُرِدٌّ: and see also 6. And hence, (assumed tropical:)  He was, or<br>\
became, very libidinous: see, again, مُرِدٌّ. And]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He (a man) was, or became, swollen with anger.<br>\
(M. [In the L and TA, erroneously written, in<br>\
this sense, ارادّ: see, again, مُرِدٌّ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also It<br>\
(the sea) was, or became, tumultuous, with many<br>\
waves. (M, L.)<br>\
5<br>\
تردّد quasi-pass. of 2; (S, L;) He, or it,<br>\
was made, or caused, to return, go back, come<br>\
back, or revert; &amp;c.; or he, or it, returned, went<br>\
back, came back, or reverted; much, frequently,<br>\
again and again, or time after time. (L.) You<br>\
say, تَرَدَّدْتُ إِلَى فُلَانٍ I returned time after time to<br>\
such a one (Msb.) And هُوَ يَتَرَدَّدُ إِلَى مَجَالِسِ العِلْمِ<br>\
He repairs frequently to, or frequents, the assemblies of science; syn. يَخْتَلِفُ. (A.) See also 6.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [And as the returning repeatedly involves the<br>\
going repeatedly, it signifies also, like اختلف,<br>\
He, or it, went, or moved, repeatedly, to and<br>\
fro; so went and came; or reciprocated. Thus,]<br>\
تَرَدُّدُ الشَّىْءِ المُعَلَّقِ فِى الهَوَآءِ [means The moving<br>\
to and fro of a thing suspended in the air]. (K<br>\
in art. ذب.) You say, تردّدت الرُّوحُ The soul, or<br>\
spirit, went and came. (W p. 5.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He wavered, or vacillated, فِى الرَّأْىِ [in opinion]: (MA:) and فِى الأَمْرِ [in the affair], (S and<br>\
K in art. لث, &amp;c.,) and بَيْنَ أَمْرَيْنِ [between two<br>\
things, or affairs]. (S and K in art. ذب, &amp;c.)<br>\
And تردّد فِى صَدْرِى كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  [Such a thing became<br>\
agitated to and fro in my mind, or bosom]. (TA<br>\
in art. رجع.) And تردّد said of a man, (assumed tropical:)  He was,<br>\

was unable to see his right course. (Bd and Jel<br>\
in ix. 45.) [And (assumed tropical:)  He laboured, or exerted himself, as though going to and fro, or making<br>\
repeated efforts, in an affair: a meaning well<br>\
known.] ―<br>\
-b4-  [And It was, or became, repeated<br>\
time after time, or reiterated: it was, or became,<br>\
reproduced: it was, or became, renewed.] You<br>\
say, تردّد صَوْتُهُ فِى حَلْقِهِ His voice was, or became, reiterated in his throat, or fauces. (The<br>\
Lexicons passim.) And تردّدفِى الفَآءِ [He reiterated in uttering the letter ف; or, as the meaning<br>\
is shown to be in the K in art. فأ, he reiterated<br>\
the letter ف (رَدَّدَ الفَآءَ)]. (S in art. فأ.) And تردّإ<br>\
فِى الجَوَابِ وَتَعَثَّرَ لِسَانُهُ [He reiterated, or stam-<br>\
mered, or stuttered, in uttering the reply, and his<br>\
tongue halted, faltered, or hesitated]. (A.)<br>\
6<br>\
ترادّ and ↓ تردّإ are both syn. with تَرَاجَعَ:<br>\
(M, L:) [or nearly so; inasmuch as each implies<br>\
repetition in returning:] you say, ترادّوا فِى مَسِيرٍ,<br>\
meaning تَرَاجَعُوا [i. e. They returned, retired,<br>\
or retreated, by degrees, or by little and little, in<br>\
a journey, or march]. (TA in art. ثبجر.) And<br>\
ترادّ المَآءُ The water reverted (↓ اِرْتَدّ [app. by<br>\
repeated refluxes]) from its channel, on account<br>\
of some obstacle in its way. (A.) And ترادّ المَآءُ<br>\
فِى ظَهْرِهِ The seminal fluid returned [by degrees]<br>\

تَرَادَّا القَوْلَ [or الكَلَامَ, and فِى القَوْلِ or فى الكَلَامِ,<br>\
They two disputed together, each rebutting, or<br>\
