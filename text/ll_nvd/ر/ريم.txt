رَيْمٌ is syn. with بَرَاحٌ; (Lth, T, M, K;) and<br>\
the verb is رَامَ, aor. يَرِيمُ, [He went away, or departed; and he quitted a place: and he ceased<br>\
doing a thing:] (Lth, T, TA:) رَيْمٌ being the<br>\
inf. n. (TA.) IAar used to say, in relation [or<br>\
reply] to the saying مَا رِمْتُ [I did not go away,<br>\
&amp;c., or I have not gone away, &amp;c.], بَلَى قَدْ رِمْتُ<br>\
[Nay, I did go away, &amp;c., or I have gone away,<br>\
&amp;c.]: but others use the verb only with a negative<br>\
particle: (T:) or it is mostly used in negative<br>\
phrases. (TA.) You say, رَامَهُ, aor. يَرِيمُهُ, (S,<br>\
Mgh,) inf. n. as above, (S,) He went away from<br>\
it, departed from it, or quitted it; syn. بَرِحَهُ;<br>\
(S;) or زَالَ مِنْهُ, and فَارَقَهُ; namely, his place.<br>\
(Mgh.) And رِمْتُ فُلَانًا and رَمْتُ مِنْ عِنْدِ فُلَانٍ<br>\
[I went away from such a one]: both meaning<br>\
the same. (S.) And لَا تَرِمْهُ Go not thou away<br>\
from him, or it; syn. لَاتَبْرَحْهُ. (S.) And مَا<br>\
رِمْتُ المَكَانَ and مَا رِمْتُ مِنْهُ (M, K) I went not<br>\
from the place; syn. مَا بَرِحْتُ. (K.) And مَا<br>\
رِمْتُ أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ (M, * K, * TA) I ceased not doing<br>\
that; syn. مَا بَرِحْتُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. تَبَاعُدٌ<br>\
[The being, or becoming, distant, remote, far off,<br>\
or aloof; &amp;c.]: (T, K:) [you say,] مَا يَرِيمٌ [He<br>\
does not become distant, &amp;c.]. (T.) [Accord. to<br>\
the TK, it is, in this sense, inf. n. of رَامَهُ, aor. as<br>\
above, meaning He was, or became, distant, &amp;c.,<br>\
from it.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And An inclining, or a leaning, in<br>\
the load of a camel, (K, TA,) by reason of excess<br>\
and heaviness thereof. (TA.) One says, لِهٰذَا<br>\
العِدْلِ رَيْمٌ عَلَى هٰذَا [There is to this side-burden<br>\
an inclining, or a leaning, by reason of an excess<br>\
of weight over this: or,] a heaviness [exceeding<br>\
that of this], by reason of which it inclines, or<br>\
leans. (TA.) [And accord. to the TK, you say<br>\
of the load of a camel, رَامَ, meaning It inclined,<br>\
or leaned.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And The becoming drawn together,<br>\
of the mouth of a wound, in order to heal; as also<br>\
رَيَمَانٌ. (K.) [Both are said in the TK to be<br>\
inf. ns. of رَامَ, aor. as above, said of a wound,<br>\
meaning Its mouth became drawn together, in<br>\
order to heal.]<br>\
-A2-  رِيمَ بِهِ i. q. قُطِعَ بِهِ [He was<br>\
or became, disabled from prosecuting, or unable to<br>\
prosecute, his journey]. (S, K.) A rájiz says,<br>\
وَرِيمَ بِالسَّاعِى الَّذِى كَانَ مَعِى<br>\
[And the messenger that was with me became<br>\
disabled from prosecuting his journey]. (S, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
ريّم عَلَيْهِ, (T, K,) inf. n. تَرْيِيمٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
exceeded him; (T, K, TA;) i. e., one man,<br>\
another; (T;) in journeying, or pace, and the<br>\
like: from رَيْمٌ as signifying زِيَادَةٌ and فَضْلٌ [i. e.<br>\
“ excess,” &amp;c.], or as signifying بَرَاحٌ [expl. above].<br>\

رَيْمٌ Excess, redundance, or superiority; syn.<br>\
فَضْلٌ, (ISk, T, S, M, K,) and زِيَادَةٌ, (S, K,) which<br>\
is like فَضْلٌ. (TA.) One says, لِهٰذَا رَيْمٌ عَلَى هٰذَا<br>\
This has excess, or superiority, (فَضْلٌ, ISk, T,)<br>\
over this. (ISk, T, S. *) الرَّيْمُ عَلَىالمَزْجُورِ, a<br>\
phrase used by El-&#39;Ajjáj, means مَنْ زُجِرَ فَعَلَيْهِ<br>\
الفَضْلُ [which may be rendered He who is chidden, it is incumbent on him to exceed; or he who<br>\
is chidden is exceeded]: (T, S:) such being always<br>\
the case; for one is chidden only on account of an<br>\
affair in which he has fallen short of doing what<br>\
was requisite. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A thing such as is termed<br>\
عِلَاوَة [q. v.] between the two side-loads of a<br>\
camel. (IAar, T, K.) Hence the saying, الرَّيْمُ<br>\
أَثْقَلُ عَلَى الدَّوَابِّ مِنَ الحِمْلِ [The additional<br>\
burden that is put between the two side-loads is<br>\
more onerous to the beasts than the (usual) load].<br>\
(TK) after the flesh of the slaughtered camel has<br>\
been distributed (T, S) in the game called المَيْسِر,<br>\
(T,) and which is given to the slaughterer: (M,<br>\
K:) accord. to Lh, the camel for slaughter is<br>\
brought, and its owner slaughters it, then puts it<br>\
upon something laid upon the ground to preserve<br>\
it from pollution, having divided it into ten<br>\
portion, namely, the two haunches, and the two<br>\
thighs, and the rump, and the withers, and the<br>\
breast, and [the part of the back called] the<br>\
مَلْحَآء [q. v.], and the two shoulders together<br>\
with the two arms; then he betakes himself to the<br>\
طَفَاطِف [or soft parts, such as the flanks, or the<br>\
soft parts of the belly], and the vertebræ of the<br>\
neck, and distributes them upon those portions<br>\
equally; and if there remain a bone, or a small<br>\
piece of flesh, that is the رَيْم: then the slaughterer<br>\
waits with it for him who desires it, and he whose<br>\
arrow wins, his it is; otherwise, it is for the<br>\
slaughterer. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The last portion of the<br>\
day-time, extending to the confusedness (اِخْتِلَاط,<br>\
for which اِخْتِلَاف is erroneously put in the copies<br>\
of the K, TA) of the darkness. (M, K, TA.) A<br>\
long [indefinite period such as is termed] سَاعَة:<br>\
(S, K:) so in the saying, قَدْ بَقِىَ رَيْمٌ مِنَ النَّهَارِ<br>\
[A long period of the day-time had remained; or,<br>\
emphatically, remains]. (S.) And نَهَارٌ رَيْمٌ means<br>\
A long day or day-time: so in the saying, عَلَيْكَ<br>\
نَهَارٌ رَيْمٌ [app. meaning A long day is appointed<br>\
thee for the performance of a work or task].<br>\
(AZ, T.)<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. دَرَجَةٌ [as meaning A series<br>\
of stairs:] (IAar, Jm, T, S, M, K:) of the dial. of<br>\
El-Yemen. (S.) Aboo-&#39;Amr Ibn-&#39;Alà says, as<br>\
related by As, I was in El-Yemen, and I came<br>\
to the house of a man, inquiring for him, and a<br>\
man of the house said to me, اُسْمُكْ فِى الرَّيْمِ,<br>\
meaning اِصْعَدِ الدَّرَجَةِ [Ascend thou the stairs].<br>\
(JM, cited in the PS.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. دُكَّانٌ [meaning A kind of wide bench, of stone or brick; and<br>\
also a shop]: (M, TA:) likewise of the dial. of<br>\
El-Yemen. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Small mountains.<br>\

to the K, erroneously, ↓ رَيْمٌ, The antilope leucoryx;] a white antelope; (Jm, PS;) an antelope (ظَبْىٌ) that is purely white: (IAar, T, K:)<br>\
written with and without ء: [see رِئْمٌ, in art. رأم:]<br>\

مَرْيَمٌ A woman who loves the discourse of men,<br>\
but does not act vitiously or immorally, or commit<br>\
adultery or fornication. (K.) Also a [female]<br>\
proper name. (K.) It is said by AA to be of the<br>\
measure مَفْعَلٌ from رَامَ, aor. يَرِيمُ: (S, Sgh, Msb,<br>\
TA:) but some say that, as a proper name, it is<br>\
arabicized, from مَارِيَة. (TA.)<br>\
