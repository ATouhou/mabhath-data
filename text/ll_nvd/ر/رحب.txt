رَحُبَ, (Msb, K,) said of a place, (Msb,) or<br>\
of a thing, (TA,) and رَحُبَتْ, said of a land,<br>\
(أَرْض, S,) or of a country, (بِلَاد, A, TA,) aor.<br>\
رَحُبَ,<br>\
inf. n. رُحْبٌ (S, A, * Msb, K) and رَحَابَةٌ; (S, K;)<br>\
and رَحِبَ, (Msb, K,) and رَحِبَتْ, (TA,) aor.<br>\
رَحَبَ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) inf. n. رَحَبٌ; (Msb, TA;) and ↓ ارحب,<br>\
(Msb, K,) and ارحبت; (TA;) It was, or became,<br>\
ample, spacious, wide, or roomy. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
رَحُبَتِ الدَّارُ and ↓ أَرْحَبَت both signify the same,<br>\
i.e. The house, or abode, was ample, &amp;c.; or may<br>\
the house, or abode, be ample, &amp;c. (S, TA.) And<br>\
they said, عَلَيْكَ وَطُلَّتْ ↓ أَرْحَبَتْ, meaning May<br>\
it (the country, البِلَادُ,) be spacious to thee, and<br>\
be moistened by gentle rain, or by dew: so accord.<br>\
to Aboo-Is-hák. (TA.) ضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الأَرْضُ<br>\
بِمَا رَحُبَتْ, in the Kur ix. 119, means The earth<br>\
became strait to them with [i. e. notwithstanding]<br>\
its spaciousness. (Bd, Jel.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَحُبَ, accord. to<br>\
the original usage, is trans. by means of a particle; so that one says, رَحُبَ بِكَ المَكَانُ [The<br>\
place was, or may the place be, spacious with<br>\
thee]: afterwards, by reason of frequency of<br>\
usage, it became trans. by itself; and thus one<br>\
said, رَحُبَتْكَ الدَّارُ [The house, or abode, was, or<br>\
may the house, or abode, be, spacious with thee,<br>\
or to thee]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence the saying,]<br>\
أَرَحُبَكُمُ الدُّخُولُ فِى طَاعَتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  Was it proper, or<br>\
allowable, for you [to enter among his obeyers?<br>\
i. e., to become obedient to him?]: (S, K * TA:)<br>\
referring to El-Kirmánee, (so in the S,) or Ibn-El-Kirmánee: (so in the TA:) mentioned by Kh,<br>\
on the authority of Nasr Ibn-Seiyár; but he says,<br>\
(S,) the verb thus used is anomalous; (S, K;)<br>\
for a verb of the measure فَعُلَ is not trans., (K,<br>\
TA,) accord. to the grammarians, (TA,) except<br>\
with the tribe of Hudheyl, who, accord. to AAF,<br>\
make it trans. (K, TA) when its meaning admits<br>\
of its being so: (TA:) Kh mentions the phrase<br>\
رَحُبَتْكُمُ الدَّارُ [meaning The house, or abode, was,<br>\
or may the house, or abode, be, spacious with, or<br>\
to, you]; but it is thought that there is an ellipsis<br>\
here, and that it is for رَحُبَتْ بِكُمُ الدَّارُ: and ElJelál Es-Suyootee mentions, on the authority of<br>\
AAF, the saying رَحُبَ اللّٰهُ جَوْفَهُ, as meaning<br>\
وَسَّعَهُ [i. e. May God make wide his belly]:<br>\
(TA:) [J says, app. quoting Kh,] there is no<br>\
sound verb of the measure فَعُلَ that is trans.<br>\
except this; but as to the unsound, there is a<br>\
difference of opinion: accord. to Ks, قُلْتُهُ is originally قَوُلْتُهُ; but Sb says that this is not allowable, because it is trans.: (S:) Az says that<br>\
رَحُبَتْكُمْ is not held to be allowable by the grammarians; and that Nasr is not an [approved]<br>\
evidence. (TA.)<br>\

said to him مَرْحَبًا; (S, Msb;) [he welcomed him<br>\
with the greeting of مَرْحَبًا; or simply he welcomed<br>\
him;] he invited him to ampleness, spaciousness,<br>\
or roominess: (A, K:) and ↓ مَرْحَبَ, also, signifies he said مَرْحَبًا; but the expression commonly<br>\
known is رَحَّبَ بِهِ. (Har pp. 422-3.) You say,<br>\
لَقيتُهُ بِالتَّرْحِيبِ [I met him with the greeting of<br>\
مَرْحَبًا; or with welcoming]. (A.) See also مَرْحَبٌ<br>\

Hajjáj said, when he slew Ibn-El-Kirreeyeh,<br>\
أَرْحِبْ يَا غُلَامُ جُرْحَهُ [Make wide, O young man,<br>\
his wound]. (S.) And one says, in chiding a<br>\
horse or mare, أَرْحِبْ (S, K) and أَرْحِبِى (S, A,<br>\
K,) meaning Make room, and withdraw. (S,<br>\

(tropical:)  [This affair, or case, if the ways leading to it,<br>\

You say, دَعَاهُ إِلَى الرُّحْبِ [He invited him to<br>\
ampleness, &amp;c.]. (A.) And hence the saying of<br>\
Zeyd Ibn-Thábit to &#39;Omar, هٰهُنَا بِالرُّحْبِ, meaning Advance to ampleness, &amp;c. (Mgh.) See also<br>\
مَرْحَبٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is also used as an<br>\
epithet:] see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
رَحَبٌ: see the next following paragraph.<br>\
رَحَبَةٌ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and رَحْبَةٌ, (A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) K,) the former of which is the more chaste,<br>\
(A,) or the better, (Mgh,) or the more common,<br>\
(Msb,) The court, open area, or spacious vacant<br>\
part or portion, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) of a<br>\

ampleness: (TA:) and in like manner, between,<br>\
or among, houses: (A:) a desert tract, (Fr, Mgh,<br>\
TA,) or a spacious vacant tract, (A,) or a spacious piece of ground, (Msb,) between, or among,<br>\

enclosure, or a [kind of wide bench of stone or<br>\
brick such as is called] دُكَّان, that is made at<br>\
the doors of some of the mosques in the towns<br>\
and the rural districts, for prayer: hence the<br>\
saying of Aboo-&#39;Alee Ed-Dakkák, [in which it<br>\
means an enclosure outside the door of a mosque,]<br>\
“ It is not fit that the حَائِض should enter the<br>\
رحبْة of the mosque of a people, whether the رحبة<br>\
be contiguous or separate: ” and hence, also, in a<br>\
trad. of &#39;Alee, by the رحبة of El-Koofeh is meant<br>\
a دُكَّان in the midst of the mosque of El-Koofeh,<br>\
upon which he used to sit and to preach, and<br>\
upon which he is related to have cast the spoils<br>\
that he obtained from the people of En-Nahrawán:<br>\
(Mgh:) pl. ↓ رَحَبٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ رَحْبٌ (K)<br>\

and رَحْبَةٌ are the ns. un.] and [the pl. is] رِحَابٌ<br>\
and رَحَبَاتٌ (S, Msb, K) and رَحْبَاتٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, both words, An ample tract of land, that<br>\
produces much herbage, and in which people<br>\
alight, or abide, much, or often: (AHn, K:)<br>\
pl. as above, accord. to the K; but accord. to<br>\
IAar, رَحْبَةٌ signifies an ample tract of land;<br>\
(TA;) and he says that its pl. is رُحَبٌ, like as<br>\
قُرًى is pl. of قَرْيَةٌ: Az says that this occurs as an<br>\
anomalous pl. of words of the defective class, and<br>\
that he had not heard a word of the perfect class<br>\
of the measure فَعْلَةٌ having a pl. of the measure<br>\
فُعَلٌ; but that IAar is an authority worthy of<br>\
reliance. (L, Msb.) And رَحَبَةُ الوَادِى, and رَحْبَتُهُ<br>\
The part of the valley in which its water flows<br>\
into it from its two sides: (K, TA:) pl. رِحَابٌ<br>\
(TA.) [Or the pl.] رِحَابٌ signifies Plain, smooth,<br>\
or soft, places, in which water collects and stagnates: they are the places where vegetation is<br>\
most rapid, and are at the extremity of a valley,<br>\
and in its middle, and sometimes in an elevated<br>\
place, where water collects and stagnates, surrounded by what is more elevated: if in a plain<br>\
tract of land, people alight and sojourn there: if<br>\
in the interior of water-courses, people do not<br>\
alight and sojourn there: if in the interior of a<br>\
valley, and retaining the water, not very deep,<br>\
and in breadth equal to a bow-shot, people alight<br>\
and sojourn by the side thereof: رحاب are not in<br>\
sands; but they are in low and in elevated tracts<br>\
of land. (L.) ―<br>\

growth of the plant called ثُمَام [i. e. panic grass].<br>\

they are dried,] like the جَرِين for dates. (TA.)<br>\
رُحْبَى The broadest rib (S, K) in the breast:<br>\
(K:) and the رُحْبَيَانِ, are the two ribs next to the<br>\
armpits, among the upper ribs: (K:) or the<br>\
place to which each elbow returns [when, after it<br>\
has been removed from its usual place, it is brought<br>\
back thereto; which place in a beast is next the<br>\
arm pit]: (S, K:) it is there only that the camel&#39;s<br>\
elbow wounds the callous protuberance upon his<br>\
breast: (S:) or the رحبى is the place where the<br>\
heart beats, (Az, K, TA,) in a beast and in<br>\
a man: (Az, TA:) or, as some say, the part<br>\
from the place where the neck is set on to the<br>\
place where end the cartilages of the ribs, or the<br>\
extremities of the ribs projecting over the belly:<br>\
or the part between the two ribs of the base of the<br>\
neck and the place to which the shoulder-blade<br>\
returns [when, after it has moved from its usual<br>\
position, it is brought back thereto, i. e. its lower<br>\
part, next the armpit]: and the رُحْبَيَانِ, also<br>\
called the ↓ رُحْبَايَاوَانِ [perhaps a mistranscription<br>\
for رُحْبَاوَانِ as though the sing. were رُحْبَآءٌ,] of<br>\
the horse, are the upper parts of the كَشْحَانِ [or<br>\
two flanks.] (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A certain brand, or<br>\

S, A, TA;) not straitness: (T, TA:) or alight<br>\
thou, (Kh, Lth, TA,) or abide thou, (Kh, TA,)<br>\
in ampleness, &amp;c.; (Kh, Lth, TA;) for such we<br>\

in the accus. case because of a verb understood:<br>\
(Kh, TA:) or thou hast alighted in an ample, a<br>\
spacious, or a roomy, place: (Msb:) [or welcome<br>\
to ampleness, &amp;c.; or to an ample, a spacious,<br>\

مَرْحَبًا بِكَ اللّٰهُ وَمَسْهَلًا [May God grant ampleness<br>\

IAar say: and the Arabs also say, لَا مَرْحَبًا بِكَ,<br>\
meaning May it [the land or country] not be<br>\
ample, or spacious, to thee: مَرْحَبًا, he says, is one<br>\
of the inf. ns. that are used in calling down<br>\
blessings or curses on a man; as سَقْيًا and رَعْيًا<br>\
and جَدْعًا and عَقْرًا, for سَقَاكَ اللّٰهُ and رَعَاكَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
