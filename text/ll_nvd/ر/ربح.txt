رَبِحَ فِى تِجَارَتِهِر (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
رَبَحَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. رِبْحٌ (Mgh, Msb, TA)<br>\
and رَبَحٌ and رَبَاحٌ, (Msb, TA,) He gained; or<br>\
made gain, or profit; in his traffic; (MA, KL,<br>\
TK;) i. q. اِسْتَشَفَّ (S, K) or أَفْضَلَ. (Az, Msb.)<br>\
The Arabs say to a man when he enters upon<br>\
traffic, بِالرَّبَاحِ وَالسَّمَاحِ [With gaining and liberality.] (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And رَبِحَتْ تِجَارَتُهُ (tropical:)  (A, Msb,<br>\
TA) His traffic brought him gain, or profit.<br>\
(Msb, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
ربّحهُ: see 4.<br>\
-A2-  Also ربّح, inf. n. تَرْبِيحٌ,<br>\
He took to himself (اِتَّخَذَ) an ape (رُبَّاح, TA) in<br>\
his place of abode. (K.)<br>\
3<br>\
أَعْطَاهُ مَالًا مُرَابَحَةً He gave him property on<br>\
the condition that the gain, or profit, should be<br>\
[divided] between them two. (TA.) And بِعْتُهُ<br>\
المَتَاعَ مُرَابَحَةً (S, * Msb) I sold him the commodity naming a certain gain, or profit, for<br>\
every portion of the price: (Msb:) you say,<br>\
بِعْتُهُ السِّلْعَةَ مُرَابَحَةً عَلَى كُلِّ عَشَرَةِ دَرَاهِمَ دِرْهَمٌ<br>\
[I sold him the commodity on the condition of my<br>\
receiving as gain, or profit, upon every ten dirhems,<br>\
a dirhem]: (TA:) and اِشْتَرَيْتُهُ مِنْهُ مَرَابَحَةً I<br>\
bought it of him in like manner: (Msb, TA:)<br>\
the gain, or profit, must be named. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also 4.<br>\
4<br>\
اربح فِى تِجَارَتِهِ He found a profitable<br>\
market in [or for] his traffic. (Az, Msb.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
اربحهُ He gave him gain, or profit: (Mgh, Msb:)<br>\
↓ ربّحهُ we have not heard; (Mgh;) [i. e.] رَبَّحْتُهُ<br>\
as meaning I gave him gain, or profit, has not<br>\
been transmitted [from the Arabs of classical<br>\
times]. (Msb.) You say, أَرْبَحْتُهُ عَلَى سِلْعَتِهِ,<br>\
(S,) or عَلَيْهَا ↓ رَابَحْتُهُ, (A, K,) or both, (TA,) I<br>\
gave him a gain, or profit, upon his commodity.<br>\
(S, A, K, TA.) And اربحهُ بِمَتَاعِهِ [He made him<br>\
to gain by his commodity]. (TA.) And اربح<br>\
اللّٰهُ بَيْعَتَهُ [God made, or may God make, his sale<br>\
to be productive of gain, or profit]. (S and K in<br>\
art. رجع.)<br>\
-A3-  Also اربح He slaughtered for his<br>\
guests young weaned camels; (K, TA;) which<br>\
are called رَبَح. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  And اربح النَّاقَةَ He<br>\
milked the she-camel in the early morning, or<br>\
between the prayer of daybreak and sunrise, and<br>\
at midday. (K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تربّح He sought gains, or profits. (A.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
He (a man, TA) was, or became, confounded or<br>\
perplexed, and unable to see his right course. (K.)<br>\
رِبْحٌ and ↓ رَبَحٌ and ↓ رَبَاحٌ [all originally inf. ns.]<br>\
Gain, or profit; (IAar, S, A, K, and Mgh in explanation of the first and last;) increase [obtained]<br>\
in traffic; (TA;) excess, or surplus, [obtained,]<br>\
above the capital [expended]; wherefore it is also<br>\
termed شِفٌّ. (Ksh and Bd in explanation of the<br>\
first in ii. 15.) [Hence,] ↓ البِرُّ خَيْرُ تِجَارَةٍ رَبَاحًا<br>\
(tropical:)  [Piety is the best traffic in respect of gain, or<br>\
profit.] (A.)<br>\
رَبَحٌ: see the next preceding paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Horses and camels that are brought from one<br>\
place to another for sale. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Fat, as<br>\
a subst. (S, K.) A poet says, (S,) namely,<br>\
Khufáf Ibn-Nudbeh, (TA,)<br>\
قَرَوْا أَضْيَافَهُمْ رَبَحًا بِبُحٍّ<br>\
يعِيشُ بِفَضْلِهِنَّ الحَىُّ سُمْرِ<br>\
[as though meaning They entertained their guests<br>\
with fat, on the superabundant remains of which<br>\
the tribe lived, by means of tawny-coloured<br>\
gaming-arrows whereby the lots that determined<br>\
who should afford the entertainment were divided]:<br>\
(S, * TA:) but [this is inconsistent with the affixed<br>\
pronoun relating to ربحا, wherefore], in this case,<br>\
as some say, (S, TA,) it means young weaned<br>\
camels; (S, K, TA;) [as a quasi-pl. n.;] and its<br>\
sing. is ↓ رَابِحٌ; (K;) like as that of حَرَسٌ is<br>\
حَارِسٌ; and that of خَادِمٌ خَدَمٌ: (TA:) or a<br>\
young weaned camel; [like رُبَحٌ;] and its pl. is<br>\
رِبَاحٌ: (K:) or it means here the gain, or profit,<br>\
obtained by means of the game called الَميْسِر.<br>\
(S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also the next paragraph.<br>\
رُبَحٌ A young weaned camel; (S, K:) app. a<br>\
dial. var. of رُبَعٌ. (S.) [See also رَبَحٌ and رُبَّاحٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  A lamb, or kid: (ISd, TA in art. نصح:) or<br>\
the latter: (K;) as also ↓ رُبَّاحٌ. (IAar, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
See also رُبَّاحٌ, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A certain<br>\
bird, (S, K,) resembling the رَامِج [which is an<br>\
owl employed for catching hawks]: or, accord. to<br>\
Kr, the word is ↓ رَبَحٌ, and signifies a certain<br>\
bird resembling the زَاغ[or rook]. (TA.)<br>\
رَبَاحٌ: see رِبْحٌ in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain<br>\
small animal, resembling the cat. (So in many<br>\
copies of the S.) F observes that J says, الرَّبَاحُ<br>\
دُوَيْبَّةٌ يُجْلَبُ مِنْهَا الكَافُورُ; and that بَلَدٌ has been<br>\
substituted as an amendment for دويبّة in some of<br>\
the copies [of the S]; but that each of these<br>\
readings is erroneous: for يجلب we find [in<br>\
copies of the S] in the handwriting of Aboo-Zekereeyà and that of Aboo-Sahl يُحْلَبُ, with<br>\
the unpointed ح; and the substitution of بلد for<br>\
دويبَة was made by IKtt: in the copies of the S,<br>\
moreover, we find مِنْهُ instead of مِنْهَا: and IB<br>\
says that the passage in J&#39;s original copy, in his<br>\
own handwriting, runs thus: الرَّبَاحُ أَيْضًا دُوَيْبَّةٌ<br>\
كَالسِّنَّورِ يُجْلَبُ مِنْهُ الكَافُورُ. (TA.) [But I find<br>\
that, in five copies of the S, between السنّور and<br>\
يجلب, occur the words وَالرَّبَاحُ أَيْضًا بَلَدٌ, or بَلْدَةٌ<br>\
or اسْمُ بَلَدٍ: and I think it most probable that J<br>\
intended to have introduced these or similar words,<br>\
and therefore wrote مِنْهُ instead of مِنْهَا; meaning<br>\
that رباح is the appellation of a certain small<br>\
animal, resembling the cat: and that الرباح is<br>\
also the name of a country or town from which<br>\
camphor is brought: this country or town is said<br>\
in a marginal note in a copy of the S to be in<br>\
India.]<br>\
رُبَاحٌ: see رُبَّاحٌ.<br>\
رَبِيحٌ: see رَابِحٌ.<br>\
رَبَاحِىٌّ A certain kind of camphor: (K:) so<br>\
called in relation to a certain country, or town,<br>\
agreeably with what is [said to have been] asserted<br>\
by J, or to a certain king named رَبَاحٌ, who applied his mind to this kind of camphor, and discovered it. (TA.)<br>\
رُبَّاحٌ (A&#39; Obeyd, S, A, L, K) and ↓ رُبَاحٌ, (A, TA,)<br>\
the latter of the dial. of El-Yemen, (TA,) and<br>\
↓ رُبَحٌ, (L, TA,) The male ape; (S, A, L, K;)<br>\
[simia caudata, clunibus nudis: (Forskål, &quot;Descr.<br>\
Animalium&quot; &amp;c., p. iii.:)] or the young one of<br>\
an ape: (TA:) or apes [as a coll. gen. n.]:<br>\
(TA in art. نصح, in explanation of the last,<br>\
which is there said to be originally رُبَاحٌ:) pl. of<br>\
the first رَبَابِيحُ. (TA.) One says أَمْلَحُ مِنْ رُبَّاحٍ<br>\
and رُبَاحٍ, meaning [Prettier] than the ape. (A,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] رُبُّ رُبَّاحٍ (Lth, A, K) or<br>\
رُبَاحٍ (A) A sort of dates (Lth, A, K) of ElBasrah. (Lth.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (K,) accord. to some,<br>\
(TA,) رُبَّاحٌ signifies A small young weaned camel,<br>\
(K,) and small young camels, syn. حَاشِيَةٌ, (TA,)<br>\
slender in the bones and meagre in the body:<br>\
(K:) but A Heyth asks, How can it mean small<br>\
young weaned camels, seeing that a poet applies<br>\
to it the epithet ثَنِىّ, and the ثنىّ is five years<br>\
old? and Khidásh Ibn-Zuheyr, in a verse cited<br>\
by Sh, speaks of a ربّاح breathing hard in labour,<br>\
in order that her young one might come forth.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also رُبَحٌ.<br>\
مَتْجَرٌ رَابِحٌ and ↓ رَبِيحٌ (tropical:)  Trafficking in which<br>\
one makes gain, or profit; (TA;) and so تِجَارَةٌ<br>\
رَابِحَةٌ; (T, S, A, * Msb, K;) [lucrative, or profitable, traffic;] a phrase like لَيْلٌ نَائِمٌ and سَاهِرٌ<br>\
meaning &quot;a night in which one sleeps&quot; and &quot;in<br>\
which one is wakeful:&quot; (Az, TA:) and بَيْعٌ<br>\
↓ مُرْبِحٌ a sale in which one makes gain, or profit.<br>\
(TA.) And مَالٌ رَابِحٌ (assumed tropical:)  Property having gain,<br>\
or profit: رابح in this case being like لَابِنٌ and<br>\
تَامِرٌ: occurring in a trad.: but some read [رَائِحٌ,<br>\
or, more probably, رَائِجٌ, from رَاجَ,] with ى [or<br>\
rather ء]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also رَبَحٌ.<br>\
مُرْبِحٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
