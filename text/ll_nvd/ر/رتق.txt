رَتُقَ (S, L, Msb) and<br>\
رَتِقَ, (L,) inf. n.<br>\
رَتْقٌ, (S, M, L, Msb, K,) He closed up, (M, Msb,<br>\
TA,) and repaired, (M, TA,) a rent: (S, M,<br>\
Msb, TA:) [he sewed up, or together: see رِتَاقٌ:]<br>\
الرَّتْقُ is the contr. of  الفَتْقُ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
one says, رَتَقَ فَتْقَهُمْ, meaning (tropical:)  [He closed up the<br>\
breach that was between them; he reconciled them;<br>\
or] he reformed, or amended, the circumstances<br>\
subsisting between them. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  رَتِقَتْ, aor.<br>\
رَتَقَ,<br>\
(IKoot, Msb, TA,) inf. n. رَتَقٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA,) in the K, erroneously, رَتَقَةٌ, (TA,) She was,<br>\
or became, such as is termed رَتْقَآء; (IKoot, S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) said of a woman, (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K,) or of a girl, and also of a camel. (IKoot,<br>\
Msb.)<br>\

ارتتق It was, or became, closed up, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) [and repaired; and sewed up, or together;]<br>\
said of a rent: (S, Msb:) and also of the vulva<br>\
of a woman. (S, * TA.)<br>\
رَتْقٌ i. q. ↓ مَرْتُوقٌ [and مَرْتُوقَةٌ, &amp;c., being originally an inf. n.; i. e. Closed up, and repaired;<br>\
applied to a rent; and so ↓ رَتَقٌ]. (TA.) كَانَتَا<br>\
رَتْقًا فَفَتَقْنَاهُمَا, in the Kur [xxi. 31, lit. They (the<br>\
heavens and the earth) were closed up, and we<br>\
rent them], is from الرَّتْقُ as the contr. of الفَتْقُ:<br>\
(S:) accord. to Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, it means they were<br>\
closed up, without any interstice, and we rent<br>\
them by the rain and by the plants: accord. to<br>\
Az, it means they were a heaven closed up and<br>\
an earth closed up, and we rent them into seven<br>\
heavens and seven earths: Lth says that the<br>\
heavens were closed up, no rain descending from<br>\
them; and the earth was closed up, without any<br>\
fissure therein; until God rent them by the rain<br>\
and the plants: Zj says that رَتْقًا is for ذَوَاتَىْ رَتْقٍ:<br>\
(TA:) and he says that the heaven and the earth<br>\
were united, and God rent them by the air, which<br>\
He placed between them: (TA in art. فتق:)<br>\
some read ↓ رَتَقًا, for شَيْئًا رَتَقًا, meaning مَرْتُوقًا.<br>\
(Bd.)<br>\
رَتَقٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
-A2-  It is [also] pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]<br>\
of ↓ رَتَقَةٌ, syn., accord. to the copies of the K,<br>\
with رُتْبَةٌ, but correctly with رَتَبَةٌ, which signifies<br>\
The space between [any two of] the fingers:<br>\
mentioned [in the JK, where I find the correct<br>\
reading, and] by Ibn-&#39;Abbád. (TA.)<br>\
رَتَقَةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
رَتْقَآءُ, applied to a woman, (AHeyth, S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) or to a girl, (Lth,) [and also to a she-camel, (see 1, last sentence,)] Impervia coëunti;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) having the meatus of the vagina<br>\
closed up: (S, * Msb:) or having no aperture<br>\
except the مَبَال [or meatus urinarius]: (Lth,<br>\
Mgh, K:) or having the فَرْج so drawn together<br>\
that the ذَكَر can hardly, or not at all, pass.<br>\
(AHeyth.)<br>\
رِتَاقٌ [A garment composed of] two pieces of<br>\
cloth sewed together (يُرْتَقَانِ) by their borders.<br>\
(Lth, S, K.) Hence the saying of a rájiz,<br>\
جَارِيَ بَيْضَآءُ فِى رِتَاقِ<br>\
تُدِيرُ طَرْفًا أَكْحَلَ المَآقِى<br>\
[A fair girl in a رتاق, turning about eyes black<br>\
in the inner angles.] (Lth, S. *)<br>\
رُتُوقٌ Inaccessableness, or unapproachableness;<br>\
(مَنَعَةٌ, [in some copies of the K, الخنعة is erroneously put for المَنَعَةُ,]) and might; and high, or<br>\
elevated, rank. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K, TA.)<br>\
رَاتِقٌ [for سَحَابٌ رَاتِقٌ] Clouds closing up, or<br>\
coalescing. (AHn, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  هُوَ الفَاتِقُ الرَّاتِقُ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
is the possessor of command or rule, so that he<br>\
opens and closes, and straitens and widens. (Har<br>\
p. 208.) [See also مِخْلَطٌ.]<br>\
فَرْجٌ أَرْتَقُ A vulva of which the sides stick<br>\
together. (TA.)<br>\
