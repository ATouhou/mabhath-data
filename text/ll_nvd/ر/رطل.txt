رَطَلَ, (O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
رَطُلَ, inf. n. رَطْلٌ,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) He weighed a thing: (O, TA:) or<br>\
he put in motion a thing with his hand, (IDrd,<br>\
O,) or weighed with his hand a thing, (Msb,) or<br>\
tried a thing, (K,) in order that he might know<br>\
its weight (IDrd, O, Msb, K) nearly. (Msb.)<br>\
[See also 2.] But IF says, of this combination of<br>\
letters and the like, that they are not of the<br>\
genuine language [of the Arabs]. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  He<br>\
ran; syn. عَدَا. (O, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
تَرْطِيلٌ The act of weighing by, or with, أَرْطَال<br>\
[or pound-weights]. (K.) [See also 1.]<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
The anointing of the hair, (S, O,) or making it<br>\
soft, or smooth, (K,) with oil, or ointment, and<br>\
the crimping (تَكْسِير) thereof: (S, O, K:) and the<br>\
making it to be loose, and to hang down: (IAar,<br>\
IAmb, K:) accord. to IAmb, رطّل شَعَرَهُ means<br>\
he made his hair to be loose, and to hang down:<br>\
(O:) but accord. to the T, the saying of the<br>\
vulgar, رَطَّلْتُ شَعَرِى, as meaning رَجَّلْتُهُ, [i. e. I<br>\
made my hair to be wavy, or somewhat curly;<br>\
or combed it; or combed it down; &amp;c.;] is a<br>\
mistake: for ترطيل signifies the act of making the<br>\
hair soft, or smooth, with oil, or ointment; and<br>\
wiping it so that it becomes soft, or smooth, and<br>\
glossy. (TA.)<br>\

counterpoising gold for gold, and وَرِقًا بِوَرِقٍ<br>\

says] I have not found this except in the “ Muwatta. ” (Mgh.) You say also, بَاعَ مُرَاطَلَةً [He<br>\
sold by counterpoising]. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
ارطل He had a child such as is termed رَطْل<br>\
[q. v.]: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K:) or his ears became<br>\

رَطْلٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ رِطْلٌ (K) A man soft,<br>\
lax, or uncompact; (S, O, K, * TA;) as also<br>\
↓ مُرْطِلٌ: (K, TA:) and old and weak: or inclining to softness, and laxness, or uncompactness, and old age: (K:) and a boy slender, slim,<br>\
or lean, (K, TA,) or, as some say, (TA,) near to<br>\
attaining puberty, or virility: (K, TA:) or whose<br>\
bones have not become strong: (K:) or the former,<br>\
applied to a boy, whose strength has not become<br>\
fully established; as also ↓ مُرْطَلٌ [thus written<br>\
with fet-h to the ط]: (O:) pl. رِطَلَةٌ: (O, TA:)<br>\
and the first, i. e. رَطْلٌ, a man who is foolish;<br>\
stupid; unsound, or deficient, in intellect or<br>\
understanding; (K;) fem. with ة: (TA:) one<br>\
who has not, or possesses not, what suffices; or<br>\
who is not profitable to any one: and also having<br>\
flaccid ears: (O:) and, applied to a horse, (Ibn-<br>\

say, the latter only, (TA,) light, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,<br>\
K, TA,) and weak: (TA:) fem. with ة, (O, K,<br>\
TA,) in all the senses. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [الرَّطْلُ is also<br>\
explained in the K as syn. with العَدْلُ: but<br>\
perhaps this is a mistranscription for العَدْوُ, inf. n.<br>\
of عَدَا: see 1, last sentence.]<br>\
-A3-  See also the next<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
رِطْلٌ and ↓ رَطْلٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) the<br>\
former of which is the better known, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
or the more chaste, (O, TA,) [but the latter is<br>\
that which is now in common use,] A certain<br>\
thing with which one weighs, (Mgh, O, Msb,) or<br>\
which one uses as a measure of capacity: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) [or rather both: a pound-weight: and a<br>\
pint-measure: and also a pound of anything: and<br>\
a pint of anything:] the half of what is termed<br>\
مَنًا: (S:) accord. to the standard of Baghdád,<br>\
twelve ounces; the ounce (أُوقِيَّة) being an إِسْتَار<br>\
and two thirds of an استار; and the استار being<br>\
four مَثَاقِيل and half of a مِثْقَال; and the مثقال<br>\
being a دِرْهَم and three sevenths of a درهم; and<br>\
the درهم being six دَوَانِق; and the دَانِق being eight<br>\
حَبَّات and two fifths of a حَبَّة; so that the رطل<br>\
is ninety مثاقيل; i. e. a hundred and twenty-eight<br>\
دَرَاهِم and four sevenths of a درهم (Msb:) or,<br>\
accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, a hundred and twenty-eight<br>\
دراهم of the weight of seven (وَزْنَ سَبْعَةٍ [explained<br>\
voce دِرْهَمٌ]): (Mgh:) or twelve ounces; the ounce<br>\
(أُوقِيَّة, i. e. the ounce of the Arabs, TA,) being<br>\
forty دراهم; (Mgh, K, TA;) so that the whole is<br>\
four hundred and eighty دراهم: (Mgh, TA:)<br>\
this is the Syrian رطل: (TA:) and thus it is,<br>\
accord. to El-Harbee, in the saying, السُّنَّةُ فِى<br>\
النِّكَاحِ رِطْلٌ [meaning The usage of the Prophet<br>\
in the case of marriage was to give a رطل of<br>\
silver]: (Mgh, TA:) so says Az in the T:<br>\
(Mgh:) or, as is [also] said by Az, it is in this<br>\
instance twelve ounces and a نَشّ; the نشّ being<br>\
twenty [دراهم] so that the whole is five hundred<br>\
دراهم; as is related on the authority of &#39;Áïsheh:<br>\
but in a trad. &#39;Omar, twelve ounces, without<br>\
the mention of the نشّ: accord. to the lawyers,<br>\
[however,] when the رطل is mentioned without<br>\
restriction, what is meant thereby is the رطل of<br>\
Baghdád: (TA:) [as a measure of capacity,<br>\
i. e. a pint,] it is said in the A [&amp;c.] to be the<br>\
eighth part of the صَاع; the half of the مُدّ;<br>\
(TA;) [i. e.] the half of the مَنّ: and hence<br>\
applied to one of the vessels of the vintner [app.<br>\
because it contains a pint]: (Har p. 650:) pl.<br>\
أَرْطَالٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
