foolishness. (TA.) [See also 4 in art. رعى.]<br>\

-b5-  El-Basrah is termed الرَّعْنَآءُ, as being likened to<br>\
the رَعْن of a mountain; (IDrd, S, K;) i. e.,<br>\
because of a bend in it: (TA:) or because of the<br>\
abundant flow of the river there, and its sultry<br>\
heat: (Az, MF:) or because of the ease and plenty<br>\
that are in it, and as being likened to the woman<br>\
to whom this epithet is applied; or because of the<br>\
languidness and changeableness of its air. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
