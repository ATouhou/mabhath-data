↓ مُسْتَرْخٍ signifies the same, as is shown by the<br>\

رُخْوَةٌ (K) [and مُسْتَرْخِيَةٌ]. You say حَجَرٌ رِخْوٌ or<br>\

and gentle, moderate, deliberate, or leisurely, in<br>\

instead of فهى رِخْوَةٌ because meaning فَهِىَ شَىْءٌ<br>\

-b3-  الحُرُوفُ الرِّخْوَةُ [which may be<br>\
rendered The lax letters] is said in the K, by an<br>\
anticipation of the pen, to be applied to the letters<br>\
exclusive of those comprised in the phrase لَمْ يُرْعُونَا<br>\
[for which some say لَمْ يَرْوِ عَنَّا]: Sgh says [correctly] that they are the letters exclusive of those<br>\
termed الشَّدِيدَةُ and of those in the phrase<br>\
لم يرعونا: as is said in the M, they are thirteen;<br>\
namely, ث,ح,خ,ذ,ز,س,ش,ص,ض,ظ,غ,ف,<br>\
and ه; [to which De Sacy adds, in his Grammar,<br>\
(2nd ed. i. 29,) ا without ء, and و and ى, which<br>\
are generally included in an intermediate class<br>\
between the شديدة and the رخوة, namely, in the<br>\
class consisting of the letters in the phrase لم يرعونا<br>\
or لم يرو عنّا:] the letter termed رِخْوٌ is that in<br>\
which the sound runs on, as it does, for instance,<br>\
in the س and ش when you say المَسّ and<br>\
الرَّشّ. (TA.)<br>\
رُخْوَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
رِخْوَةٌ an inf. n. of 1: (M, K:) i. q. اِسْتِرْخَآءٌ [i. e.<br>\
Softness, yieldingness, flaccidity, &amp;c.: see 1, first<br>\
sentence]; as also ↓ رُخْوَةٌ: you say, فِيهِ رِخْوَةٌ and<br>\
رُخْوَةٌ [In him, or it, is softness, &amp;c.]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also what next follows.<br>\
رَخَآءٌ [said by some to be an inf. n. of 1] Ampleness, or freedom from straitness, of the means, or<br>\
circumstances, of life; (JK, S, Msb, K;) [and<br>\
so رَخَآءُ البَالِ;] as also ↓ رِخْوَةٌ. (JK.) رَخَآءُ النَّفْسِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [An easy, or unstraitened, state of mind]. (S<br>\
in art. بول.)<br>\
رُخَآءٌ A soft, or gentle, wind: (S, K:) or a soft,<br>\
or gentle, and quick, wind: (JK:) or a soft, or<br>\
gentle, wind, that does not move anything. (Har<br>\
p. 38.) It has the first of these meanings in the<br>\
Kur xxxviii. 35: (Bd, Jel:) or it there means A<br>\
wind that does not oppose, or contravene, the will<br>\
of God. (Bd.)<br>\
رَخِىٌّ (Msb, K) and ↓ رَاخٍ, (K,) applied to life<br>\
(عَيْش, Msb, K), (assumed tropical:)  Ample, unstraitened, or plentiful, in its means, or circumstances: (Msb, K:)<br>\
or both applied to a man, (assumed tropical:)  in an ample, an unstraitened, or a plentiful, state of life. (TK.)<br>\
You say, إِنَّهُ لَفِى عَيْشٍ رَخِىٍّ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily he is in<br>\
an ample, an unstraitened, or a plentiful, state of<br>\
life]. (TA.) And هُوَ رَخِىُّ البَالِ (JK, S, Msb,<br>\
TA) and البَالِ ↓ رَاخِى (JK) (assumed tropical:)  He is in an ample,<br>\
or unstraitened, (S,) or an easy, or a pleasant,<br>\
and a plentiful, state, or condition. (JK, S, *<br>\
Msb, TA. * [See also other explanations in art.<br>\
بول.]) And إِنَّ ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرُ لَيَذْهَبُ مِنِّى فِى بَالٍ<br>\
رَخِىٍ [Verily that affair passes away from me, I<br>\
being in an easy state of mind,] is said when you<br>\
are not disquieted, rendered anxious, or grieved,<br>\
by the affair. (TA.)<br>\
رَاخٍ, and رَاخِى: see the next preceding<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
أَرْخَى [as meaning More relaxing or slackening or loosening] is used in a verse of Hassán Ibn-Thábit for the regular expression أَشَدُّ إِرْخَآءً: it is<br>\
like مَا أَحْوَجَهُ meaning مَا أَشَدَّ حَاجَتَهُ. (El-<br>\
Hareeree&#39;s “ Durrat el-Ghowwás,” in De Sacy&#39;s<br>\
“ Anthol. Gramm. Ar,” p. 52 of the Ar. text.)<br>\
أُرْخِيَّةٌ A thing, or part of a thing, (as, for<br>\
instance, a veil, or curtain, TK,) that one has let<br>\

or mare, (فَرَس, S,) and a she-camel, (TA,) and<br>\

إِرْخَآء: (K: [see 4, in the latter part of the paragraph:]) or that runs much in that manner:<br>\
(S:) pl. مَرَاخِىُّ. (S, TA.)<br>\
مُتَرَاخٍ [part. n. of 6, q. v.]. ―<br>\
-b2-  You say جَآءَ زَيْدٌ<br>\
مُتَرَاخِيًا زَمَانُهُ عَنْ زَمَانِ مَجِىْءِ عَمْرٍو [Zeyd came,<br>\
his time of coming being after, or later than, the<br>\
time of the coming of &#39;Amr]; i. e. جَآءَ بَعْدَ عَمْرٍو.<br>\
