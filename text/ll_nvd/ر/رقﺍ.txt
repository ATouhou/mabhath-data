رَقَأَ الدَّمْعُ, aor.<br>\
رَقَاَ, inf. n. رَقْءٌ and رُقُوْءٌ, (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) The tears stopped, or ceased<br>\
to flow; (Fs, JK, S, Mgh, Msb;) or dried up,<br>\
(IDrst, Aboo-&#39;Alee El-Kálee, K,) and stopped,<br>\
or ceased: (K:) and in like manner, الدَّمُ the<br>\
blood: (JK, S, Mgh, Msb:) whence the phrase<br>\
جُرْحَانِ لَا يَرْقَآنِ Two wounds not ceasing to bleed.<br>\
(Mgh.) And in like manner also, (JK,) رَقَأَ العِرْقُ,<br>\
(Fs, JK, K, TA, [not العَرَقُ, as supposed by<br>\
Golius and Freytag,]) inf. ns. as above, (K,)<br>\
The vein stopped or ceased [bleeding]; syn. اِنْقَطَعَ,<br>\
(Fs, JK, TA,) and سَكَنَ, (TA,) or اِرْتَفَعَ; (K;)<br>\
[in all of which explanations, دَمُهُ is understood.]<br>\
-A2-  رَقَأَ بَيْنَهُمْ, (K, TA,) aor.<br>\
رَقَاَ, inf. n. رَقْءٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He effected a reconciliation, or made peace, between them; (K, TA;) like رَفَأَ: (TA:) and [in<br>\
like manner,] رَقَأَ مَا بَيْنَهُمْ He arranged, or rightly<br>\
disposed, or rectified, the matter, or affair, between<br>\
them. (TA.) And the former phrase (رقأبينهم)<br>\
also signifies He created disorder or discord, or<br>\
made mischief, between them: thus having two<br>\
contr. meanings. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  رَقَأَ فِى الدَّرَجَةِ, (K,)<br>\
and رَقِئَ, also, mentioned by Ibn-Málik in the<br>\
“ Káfiyeh,” as a dial. var. of رَقِىَ, and both mentioned by IKtt, aor. of each<br>\
رَقَاَ, (TA,) He ascended<br>\
the series of stairs, or the ladder: (K:) on the<br>\
authority of Kr; but extr. [with respect to usage].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اِرْقَأْ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ (a dial. var.<br>\
of اِرْقَ TA) (assumed tropical:)  Be gentle with thyself, and impose<br>\
not upon thyself more than thou art able to perform: (JK, S, TA:) or abstain thou, for I<br>\
know thine evil qualities or actions: (JK:) or,<br>\
as some say, rectify thou, or rightly dispose, first<br>\
thy case, or thine affair. (TA.)<br>\

ارقأ دَمْعَهُ, (S,) or الدَّمْعَ, (K,) said of God,<br>\
(S, K,) He caused his, or the, tears to stop, or cease,<br>\
flowing; (S, TA;) or caused them to dry up,<br>\
and to stop, or cease. (K.) The saying لَا أَرْقَأَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
دَمْعَتَهُ is expl. by El-Mundhiree as meaning May<br>\
God not remove, or do away with, (لَا رَفَعَ,) his<br>\
tear. (TA.) You say also, أَرْقَأْتُ العِرْقَ [meaning<br>\
I caused the vein to stop or cease bleeding: see 1].<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
رَقُوْءٌ A styptic; or a thing that is put upon<br>\
blood for the purpose of stanching it, or stopping<br>\
its flowing: (S, K:) a subst. from رَقَأَ. (Msb.)<br>\
Hence the saying, (Msb,) accord. to J, in a trad.,<br>\
but this is a mistake, for it is a saying of Aktham,<br>\
(K,) or, accord. to the Expositions of the Fs, it<br>\
was said by Keys Ibn-&#39;Ásim El-Minkaree, (TA,)<br>\
لَا تَسُبُّوا الإِبِلَ فَإِنَّ فِيهَا رَقُوْءَ الدَّمِ [Revile not ye<br>\
camels, or it may perhaps mean hock not ye<br>\
camels, but the former, I am told, is here meant,<br>\
for in them is a preventive of the flowing of<br>\
blood]; alluding to their being given in compensation for homicide, and thus preventing the shedding of blood. (S, Msb, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
رَجُلٌ رَقُوْءٌ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ (assumed tropical:)  A man who is a reconciler<br>\
of the people; or a peacemaker between them: and<br>\
[so] رَقُوْءٌ لِمَا بَيْنَهُمْ, a phrase used by a poet. (TA.)<br>\
مَرْقَأَةٌ and مِرْقَأَةٌ, (K,) the former a n. of place,<br>\
the latter an instrumental n., and both correct,<br>\
dial. vars. of مَرْقَاةٌ and مِرْقَاةٌ, (TA,) A series of<br>\
stairs; or a ladder. (K, TA.)<br>\
