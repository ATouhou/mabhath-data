رَانَ, [aor. يَرُونُ,] inf. n. رَوْنٌ It (an affair,<br>\
or event,) was, or became, hard, difficult, or<br>\
severe. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And رَانَتْ لَيْلَتُنَا Our night was,<br>\
or became, very cloudy and hot. (Th, M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also رَانَ in art. رين.<br>\
رَوْنٌ, (so accord. to a copy of the T, [if correct,<br>\
an inf. n. used as a simple subst., see above, first<br>\
sentence,]) or ↓ رُونٌ, (so in another copy of the<br>\
T, and accord. to the K,) with damm, (K,)<br>\
Hardness, difficulty, severity, vehemence, or intenseness: (T, K:) pl. رُؤُونٌ, (T, and so in a copy<br>\
of the K,) or رُؤُونٌ. (CK.) [See also رُونَةٌ.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
رَوْنٌ signifies [or signifies also] The furthest part<br>\
of a مَشَارَة [q. v.]. (Yoo, K.)<br>\
رُونٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
رُونَةٌ The greater, main, principal, or chief,<br>\
part of a thing. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Hardness,<br>\
difficulty, or severity, of a thing, or an affair,<br>\
or event; and grievousness thereof: so in the saying, كَشَفَ اللّٰهُ عَنْكَ رُونَةَ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ [May God<br>\
remove from thee the hardness, &amp;c., and the grievousness, of this thing, or affair, or event]. (M.)<br>\
[See also رَوْنٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And The utmost limit, reach,<br>\
or degree, of a thing, in respect of heat, or cold,<br>\
or in other respects, as when said of grief, or of<br>\
war, or the like: and hence is said to be taken<br>\
the name الرُّنَةُ [or رُنَةُ, without ال, (see الرُّنَّى, in<br>\
art. رن,) as though it were a contraction of رُونَة,]<br>\
given to [the month] Jumádà-l-Ákhireh, because<br>\
of its intense cold [when it was so named]. (TA.)<br>\
أَرْوَنَانٌ: see the opinions of IAar and Sb respecting its derivation in art. رن. [It is said in<br>\
the S and K in art. نبج, that there is no word<br>\
like it except أَنْبَجَانٌ.] You say يَوْمٌ أَرْوَنَانٌ (T,<br>\
S, M, K) and ↓ أَرْوُنَانِىٌّ, (S, M,) and لَيْلَةٌ أَرْوَنَانَةٌ<br>\
(T, S, M, K) and ↓ أَرْوَنَانِيَّةٌ, (M,) A day, and a<br>\
night, hard, difficult, severe, distressing, or grievous: (S, K, * TA:) or vehemently hot and grievous: (T, TA:) or that has reached the utmost<br>\
point, or degree, in respect of joy, or grief, or<br>\
heat: or hard, difficult, or severe, in respect of<br>\
everything; in respect of heat, or cold, or clamour,<br>\
cries, shouts, or noises [&amp;c.]. (M, TA.) You<br>\
say also يَوْمُ أَرْوَنَانٍ, [virtually] meaning the same:<br>\
(K:) [or this may mean A day of clamour, &amp;c.;<br>\
as will be seen from what follows.] ↓ يَوْمُ أَرْوَنَانِى<br>\
occurs at the end of a verse of a rájiz: this may<br>\
be [by poetic license] for يَوْمُ أَرْوَنَانٍ, or for يَوْمُ<br>\
أَرْوَانَانِىٍّ: and ↓ يَوْمٌ أَرْوَنَانِى occurs at the end of a<br>\
verse of En-Nábighah El-Jaadee, for يَوْمٌ أَرْوَنَانِىٌّ.<br>\
(S.) Accord. to Sh, as is said in the T, (TA,)<br>\
يَوْمٌ أَرْوَنَانٌ, (K, TA,) as also يَوْمُ أَرْوَنَانٍ, (K,)<br>\
signifies A day that is easy, (K, TA,) or pleasant: (TA:) thus having two contr. meanings:<br>\
(K:) and Sh cited a verse of En-Nábighah ElJaadee as an ex.: but AHeyth disallowed ارونان<br>\
as having any other meaning than grief, and<br>\
difficulty or the like; and he disallowed also the<br>\
verse cited by Sh [as being an ex. of the meaning<br>\
that he assigned to it]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A voice,<br>\
or sound: (S, K:) and cries, shouts, or noises,<br>\
and clamour. (TA. [In one place, in the TA,<br>\
رون, thus written, without any vowel-sign, has<br>\
also this latter meaning assigned to it: but the<br>\
context seems to show that this is a mistranscription.])<br>\
أَرْوَنَانِىٌّ; and its fem., with ة; and أَرْوَنَانِى: see<br>\
the next preceding paragraph, in four places.<br>\
هُوَ مَرُونٌ بِهِ He is overcome, subdued, or subjected. (K.) [مَرُونٌ here is a contraction of<br>\
مَرْوُونٌ, from رَانَ having for its aor. يَرُونُ as a<br>\
dial. var. of رَانَ having for its aor. يَرِينُ: see<br>\
art. رين.]<br>\
