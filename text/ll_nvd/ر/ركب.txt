crowded, (as though mounting,) one upon another;<br>\
a phrase well known, and of frequent occurrence:<br>\

him by his hair, (K,) or by the hair of each side<br>\

his knee. (K, TA.) Hence, in a trad., رَكَبْتُ<br>\
أَنْفَهُ بِرُكْبَتِى I struck his nose with my knee.<br>\
(TA.) And in another trad., أَمَا تَعْرِفُ الأَزْدَ وَرَكْبَهَا<br>\
اِتَّقِ الأَزْدَ لَا يَأْخُذُوكَ فَيَرْكُبُوكَ [Knowest thou not<br>\
El-Azd, (the tribe so called,) and their striking<br>\
with the knee? Beware thou of El-Azd, lest they<br>\
take thee, and strike thee with their knees]: for<br>\
this practice was notorious among El-Azd; in the<br>\
dial. of whom, أُمُّ كَيْسَانَ was a metonymical appellation of the knee. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  رُكِبَ, like عُنِىَ,<br>\

it, in another thing: he composed it; constituted<br>\
it; or put it together.] تَرْكِيبٌ signifies The<br>\
putting together, or combining, things, whether<br>\
suitable or not, or placed in order or not: it is a<br>\
more general term than تَأْلِيفٌ, which is the collecting together, or putting together, suitable<br>\
things. (Kull p. 118.) You say, رَكَّبَ الفَصَّ فِى<br>\
الخَاتَمِ (S, A) He set the stone in the signet-ring:<br>\

رَكْبٌ: see رَاكِبٌ, in three places.<br>\
رَكَبٌ The عَانَة: (ISk, Msb, K:) or the place<br>\
of growth of the عَانَة, (S, K,) or of the hair of<br>\
the عَانَة: (Mgh:) [i. e. it signifies the pubes;<br>\
either as meaning the hair of the mons Veneris,<br>\
or the mons Veneris itself: generally the latter;<br>\
and this is often meant by the term عانة alone:]<br>\
or the part that slopes down from the belly, and is<br>\
beneath the ثُنَّة [q. v.] and above the pudendum:<br>\
in all these senses said by Lh to be masc.: (TA:)<br>\
or the pudendum (Az, Msb, K) itself: (TA:) or<br>\
the external portion thereof: (K:) or the رَكَبَانِ<br>\
are the roots of the two thighs, upon which is the<br>\
flesh of the pudendum, (K, TA,) or upon which<br>\
are the two portions of flesh of the pudendum:<br>\
(TA:) the ركب is masc.: (Msb:) it is common<br>\
to the man and the woman, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *)<br>\
accord. to Fr: (S, Msb:) or peculiar to the<br>\
woman, (S, Mgh, K,) accord. to Kh: (S:) ElFarezdak makes it plainly common to both,<br>\
saying,<br>\
حِينَ التَقَى الرَّكَبُ المَحْلُوقُ بِالرَّكَبِ<br>\
[When the shaven pubes met the pubes]: (TA:<br>\
[and a similar ex. is given in the S and Msb,<br>\
as cited by Fr:]) the pl. is أَرْكَابٌ (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K) and أَرَاكِيبُ; (K;) the latter being pl. of the<br>\
former; but in some copies of the K أَرَاكِبُ, like<br>\
مَسَاجِدُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Whiteness in the رُكْبَة<br>\
[or knee]. (TA.)<br>\
رَكْبَةٌ A single ride, or act of riding: pl.<br>\
رَكَبَاتٌ. (IAth, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, هُوَ<br>\
يَمْشِى الرَّكْبَةَ (tropical:)  [i. e. يَرْكَبُ رَأْسَهُ He goes at<br>\
random, heedlessly, or in a headlong manner, &amp;c.,<br>\
(see 1,)] and هُمْ يَمْشُونَ الرَّكَبَاتِ (tropical:)  [They go at<br>\
random, &amp;c.]. (A. [The meaning is there indicated by the context, and is shown by what here<br>\
follows.]) Respecting the phrase تمْشُونَ الرَّكَبَاتِ,<br>\
occurring in a trad., meaning تَرْكَبُونَ رُؤُوسَكُمْ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Ye go at random, &amp;c.], in that which is false,<br>\
wrong, or vain, and in factions, or seditions, or<br>\
the like, following one another without consideration, IAth says that رَكْبَةٌ [properly] signifies as<br>\
explained above in the first sentence of this paragraph, and that the pl. الركبات is here governed<br>\
in the accus. case by a verb understood, and [with<br>\
that verb] is a denotative of state relating to the<br>\
agent in تمشون: it supplies the place of that<br>\
verb, which it does not require to be expressed;<br>\
and the implied meaning is تَمْشُونَ تَرْكَبُونَ<br>\
الرَّكَبَاتِ. (L.)<br>\
رُكْبَةٌ a word of well-known meaning, (S, Msb,)<br>\
[The knee; i. e., in a man,] the joint between the<br>\
lower parts of the thigh and the upper parts of<br>\
the shank: (A, K:) or [in a quadruped,] the<br>\
joint between the metacarpus and the radius<br>\
(مَوْصِلُ الوَظِيفِ وَالذِّرَاعِ): this is the right explanation: in the K, مَوْضِع is erroneously put for<br>\
مَوْصِل: [this explanation is evidently given accord.<br>\
to the terms employed in the anatomy of quadrupeds as compared to human beings: in that<br>\
which next follows, there is certainly an omission,<br>\
which I have endeavoured to supply:] or the<br>\
رُكْبَتَانِ of the fore legs of the camel are the two<br>\
joints that [project forwards, in like manner as<br>\
do, in the hind legs, those that] are next the belly<br>\
[meaning the stifle-joints] when he lies down upon<br>\
his breast with folded legs: the two joints that<br>\
project behind [in the hind legs, namely, the<br>\
hocks,] are called the عُرْقُوبَانِ: in every quadruped, the ركبتان are in the fore legs, and the<br>\
عرقوبان are in the hind legs: and the عرقوب is<br>\
what is called مَوْصِلُ الوَظِيفِ [i. e. the upper joint<br>\
of the metatarsus]: (TA:) or the ركبة is the<br>\
مِرْفَق [which in a man is the elbow, but here<br>\
seems to mean the lower joint] of the ذِرَاع [or<br>\
radius] of anything [i. e. of any beast]: (K:)<br>\
[from its being said in the S and Msb that the<br>\
رُكْبَة is “ well known,” I conclude that there is<br>\
no real discrepancy in the foregoing explanations:<br>\
it is perhaps needless to add that the term رُكْبَة<br>\
is now universally applied to the knee of a man<br>\
and to what we commonly call the knee of a horse<br>\
and the like:] the pl. is رُكَبٌ, (S, Msb, K,) i. e.<br>\
the pl. of mult., and the pl. of pauc. is رُكْبَاتٌ<br>\
and رُكَبَاتٌ and رُكُبَاتٌ. (S.) Lh mentions the<br>\
phrase بَعِيرٌ مُسْتَوْقِحُ الرُّكَبِ [meaning A hardkneed camel]; as though the term رُكْبَةٌ were applied to each part, and the pl. used accord. to this<br>\
application. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says [of an agitating<br>\
affair or event], أَمْرٌ اصْطَكَّتْ فِيهِ الرُّكَبُ وَحَكَّتْ<br>\
فِيهِ الرُّكْبَةُ الرُّكَبَةَ (tropical:)  [An affair, or event, in which the<br>\
knees knocked together, and in which the knee rubbed<br>\
the knee]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And of one who has the mark<br>\
of prostration in prayer on his forehead, between<br>\
his eyes, (L,) بَيْنَ عَيْنَيْهِ مِثْلُ رُكْبَةِ العَنْزِ [Between<br>\
his eyes is the like of the knee of the she-goat].<br>\
(A, * L.) And of any two things that are alike, or<br>\
correspondent, هُمَا كَرُكْبَتَى العَنْزِ [They are like<br>\
the two knees of the she-goat]; because her two<br>\
knees fall together upon the ground when she<br>\
lies down. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And it is said in a prov., شَرُّ<br>\
النَّاسِ مَنْ مِلْحُهُ عَلَى رُكعبَتِهِ [The worst of men is<br>\
he whose fat is upon his knee]: applied to him<br>\
who is quickly angered; and to the perfidious:<br>\
(Meyd, TA:) the phrase مِلْحُهُ عَلَى رُكْبَتِهِ is also<br>\
used as meaning The smallest thing makes him<br>\
angry: (TA:) and a poet says,<br>\
لَا تَلُمْهَا إِنَّهَا مِنْ عُصْبَةٍ<br>\
مِلْحُهَا مَوْضُوعَةٌ فَوْقَ الرُّكَبْ<br>\
[Blame her not; for she is of a set of people<br>\
whose fat is placed above the knees: perhaps meaning, for she is but a woman; as women are generally fat in the part above the knee]: (TA:) or<br>\
مِنْ نِسْوَةٍ [in the place of مِنْ عُصْبَةٍ], meaning of<br>\
women whose object of anxiety, or care, is fatness<br>\
and fat: (Meyd, TA:) so that the prov. seems to<br>\
mean that the worst of men is he who has not<br>\
such intelligence as bids him to do that which is<br>\
praiseworthy, but only bids him to do that in<br>\
which is inconstancy and levity, and an inclining<br>\
to the dispositions of women, to the love of fatness<br>\
and fat. (Meyd.) [See other explanations in art.<br>\
ملح.]<br>\
-A2-  Also The lower part (أَصْل) of the plant<br>\
صِلِّيَانَة, when it has been cut. (K.)<br>\
رِكْبَةٌ A mode, or manner, of riding. (S.) You<br>\
say, هُوَ حَسَنُ الرِّكْبَةِ He has a good mode, or<br>\
manner, of riding. (A, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is said in<br>\
the K to be a subst. from رَكِبَهُ; as though signifying A riding.]<br>\
رَكَبَةٌ A company of riders upon camels, (K,)<br>\
or of owners of camels on a journey, or travellers<br>\
upon camels, exclusively of other beasts, (S,) but<br>\
less in number than the company called رَكْبٌ:<br>\
(S, K:) [and probably also a company of riders<br>\
upon any beasts, but less than what is called<br>\
رَكْبٌ:] accord. to MF, it is a pl. of رَاكِبٌ.<br>\
(TA.) [See also أُرْكُوبٌ.]<br>\
رَكْبَى and رَكْبَاةٌ: see رَكُوبٌ.<br>\

رِكَابٌ [Travelling-camels, used for riding; i. e.]<br>\
camels (S, K, TA) upon which people journey;<br>\
(S, TA;) i. q. مَطِىٌّ: (Msb:) or camels fit for<br>\
carrying: (Har p. 22:) it has no proper sing.:<br>\
(S:) the word used for the sing. is رَاحِلَةٌ: (S,<br>\
Msb, K:) or, as ISh says, in the “ Book of<br>\
Camels,” رِكَابٌ and عِيرٌ are applied to camels<br>\
that go forth for corn (طَعَام) to be brought back<br>\
upon them, both when they go forth and after<br>\
they have come back: and the former term is applied also to camels upon which people journey to<br>\
Mekkeh, on which مَحَامِل are borne: and hired<br>\
[or other] camels that carry the goods and corn<br>\
of merchants: but camels are not called عير,<br>\
though bearing corn, [unless] if hired: [I insert<br>\
the words “ or other ” and “ unless ” because it<br>\
is further said,] عير are not those that bring corn<br>\
for their owners; but these are called رِكَابٌ:<br>\
(L, TA:) the pl. is رُكُبٌ, (S, K,) accord. to<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd, (TA,) and رِكَابَاتٌ and رَكَائِبُ; (K;)<br>\
or, accord. to IAar, رُكُبٌ is not pl. of رِكَابٌ;<br>\
and others say that it is pl. of ↓ رَكُوبٌ, signifying<br>\
any beast on which one rides, [an epithet] of the<br>\
measure فَعُولٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ;<br>\
(TA;) but called by ISd a subst.; (TA voce<br>\
جَزُوزٌ;) and ↓ رَكُوبَةٌ is a more special term than<br>\
رَكُوبٌ. (TA in the present art.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
رِكَابُ السَّحَابِ (tropical:)  [The bearers of the clouds; i. e.]<br>\
the winds. (A, K.) Umeiyeh says,<br>\
تَرَدَّدُ وَالرِّيَاحُ لَهَا رِكَابُ<br>\
[It (referring to a cloud) goes to and fro (تَرَدَّد<br>\
being for تَتَرَدَّدُ), the winds being its bearers].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also [The stirrup of a horse&#39;s saddle;]<br>\
a well-known appertenance of a horse&#39;s saddle;<br>\
(S;) the same with respect to a horse&#39;s saddle as<br>\
the غَرْز with respect to a camel&#39;s: pl. رُكُبٌ. (K.)<br>\
رَكُوبٌ and ↓ رَكُوبَةٌ: see رِكَابٌ: both signify<br>\
A beast that is ridden: (S:) or a she-camel that<br>\
is ridden: (K:) or the latter has this meaning:<br>\
and is metaphorically applied to anything ridden:<br>\
(Msb:) or the former signifies any beast that is<br>\
ridden: and the latter is a name for everything<br>\
that is ridden; applied to one, and to a pl.<br>\
number: (TA:) or the former signifies ridden,<br>\
as a fem. epithet: and the latter, one specially<br>\
appointed for riding; and that is constantly kept<br>\
to work; of beasts (K, TA) of any kind: (TA:)<br>\
and the latter and ↓ رَكْبَانَةٌ and ↓ رَكْبَاةٌ and<br>\

and TA in art. حلب, [see حَلُوبٌ in several<br>\
places,]) a she-camel that is ridden; or that is<br>\
broken, trained, or rendered submissive or manageable: (K:) or رَكُوبٌ has this last signification,<br>\
accord. to AZ: and its pl. is رُكُبٌ: (TA:) the<br>\
pl. of رَكُوبَةٌ being رَكَائِبُ: (TA voce جَزُوزٌ:)<br>\
and ↓ رَكْبَانَةٌ signifies [also] a she-camel fit<br>\
to be ridden; (S, TA;) like as حَلْبَانَةٌ signifies fit to be milked: the ا and ن are [said to be]<br>\
added in order to give intensiveness to the signification: (TA:) [and all the other epithets mentioned above seem also, accord. to some, to have<br>\
an intensive sense: see حَلُوبٌ.] You say, مَا لَهُ<br>\
رَكُوبَةٌ وَلَا حَمُولَةٌ وَلَا حَلُوبَةٌ He has not a she-camel to ride, nor one to carry burdens, nor one<br>\

نَخْلٌ رَكِيبٌ (K) and رَكِيبٌ مِنْ نَخْلٍ (TA) Palmtrees planted in a row by a rivulet, or not by a<br>\

gardens of palm-trees and grape-vines: (so accord.<br>\
to the text of the K in the TA:) or what is between two gardens of palm-trees and grape-vines:<br>\
(so accord. to the CK and my MS. copy of the<br>\
K:) or grape-vines between two rivers or rivulets:<br>\
(TA:) or a place of seed-produce: (K:) or a<br>\

رَكُوبَةٌ: see رَكُوبٌ.<br>\
زَيْتٌ رِكَابِىٌّ [Olive-oil:] so called because brought<br>\
on camels from Syria. (S, A, * K.)<br>\
رَكَّابٌ and ↓ رَكُوبٌ, applied to a man, (K, TA,)<br>\
the latter on the authority of Th, (TA,) signify<br>\
the same, (K, TA,) Who rides much; a great<br>\
rider: and so رَكَّابَةٌ applied to a woman. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] رَكَّابٌ لِلْأُمُورِ (assumed tropical:)  A man who surmounts, or masters, affairs; [or who often does<br>\
so; or accustomed to embark in, or undertake, or<br>\
to surmount, or master, them; or who often embarks in, or undertakes, them, and therefore surmounts, or masters, them;] by his knowledge, and<br>\
repeated experience, and good judgment. (K and<br>\
TA in art. طلع.)<br>\
عَلاهُ الرُّكَّابُ (tropical:)  The nightmare, or incubus, came<br>\
upon him. (A.)<br>\
رَكَّابَةٌ: see the latter part of the next paragraph.<br>\
رَاكِبٌ Riding; or a rider: (Mgh, Msb, K:)<br>\
or properly only a rider upon a camel: (ISk, S,<br>\
K:) or the latter is its meaning when it is not<br>\
used as a prefixed noun, as explained below; and<br>\
is said to be the original signification: IB says<br>\
that it may signify a rider upon a camel, ass,<br>\
horse, or mule, when used as a prefixed noun; as<br>\
when you say رِاكِبُ جَمَلٍ and رَاكِبُ حِمَارٍ &amp;c.:<br>\
(L:) accord. to ISk, you term a rider upon an<br>\
ass فَارِسٌ عَلَى حِمَارٍ, (S, TA,) and a rider upon a<br>\
mule فَارِسٌ عَلَى بَغْلٍ; (TA;) but &#39;Omarah says,<br>\
I do not call the owner or rider of the ass فارس,<br>\
but حَمَّارٌ; and the reason of his saying so is<br>\
manifest, for فارس is an epithet of the measure<br>\
فَاعِلٌ from الفَرَسُ “ the horse,” meaning “ an<br>\
owner, or a rider, of the horse: ” (S, TA:) the<br>\
pl. is رُكَّابٌ (S, K) and رُكْبَانٌ (S, * Mgh, Msb, K)<br>\
and رُكُوبٌ (Mgh, K) and رِكَبَةٌ, (K,) or this last<br>\
is a mistake for رَكَبَةٌ [q. v.], (MF, TA,) and<br>\
↓ رَكْبٌ, (Akh, Msb, K, TA,) as some say; (TA;)<br>\
or this last is a quasi-pl. n., (K, TA,) not a broken<br>\
pl. of رَاكِبٌ; (TA;) and signifies riders upon<br>\
camels; (K;) or owners of camels on a journey,<br>\
or travellers upon camels; (S;) consisting of ten<br>\
or more: (S, K:) and sometimes it signifies riders<br>\
upon horses: (IB, K:) or riders upon horses and<br>\
camels: (IB, L, TA:) or a company of riders<br>\
upon horses; or upon horses and camels: (TA:)<br>\
[or, accord. to Kh, riders upon any beasts: (De<br>\
Sacy&#39;s Anthol. Gram. Ar. p. 54 of the Arabic<br>\
text:)] in the Kur viii. 43, الرَّكْبُ may signify<br>\
the riders upon horses, or the riders upon camels,<br>\
or the army composed of both these: (TA:) the<br>\
pl. of رَكْبٌ is أَرْكُبٌ, (S, K,) [a pl. of pauc.,] and<br>\
رُكُوبٌ. (K.) Accord. to IB, you do not say<br>\
إِبِلٍ ↓ رَكْبُ nor رُكْبَانُ إِبِلٍ: but it is said that<br>\
رُكَّابُ إِبِلٍ and رُكَّابُ خَيْلٍ &amp;c. are allowable.<br>\
(L.) An instance of رُكْبَان as distinguished from<br>\
فُرْسَان occurs in a verse cited as one of the exs. of<br>\
the preposition بِ. (TA.) ↓ رُكَيْبٌ [properly<br>\
signifying A small company of riders upon camels,<br>\
&amp;c.,] occurs as meaning collectors of the poorrates: it is the dim. of ↓ رَكْبٌ; and shows that<br>\
this latter is not a pl. [properly speaking] of<br>\
رَاكِبٌ; for, were it so, the word used as its dim.<br>\
would be رُوَيْكِبُونَ. (TA.) [See also رَكَبَةٌ, and<br>\
أُرْكُوبٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also A person on board of a ship<br>\
or boat: pl. رُكَّابٌ.] You say رُكَّابُ السَّفِينَةِ<br>\
(S, TA) The persons on board of the ship, or<br>\
boat: and رُكَّابُ المَآءِ the voyagers upon the water:<br>\
and Ibn-Ahmar has used in this sense the pl.<br>\
رُكْبَانٌ; but it is said that this is not allowable;<br>\
nor is أُرْكُوبٌ; nor رَكْبٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, and<br>\
↓ رَاكُوبٌ, (assumed tropical:)  A shoot germinating upon the trunk<br>\
of a palm-tree, not having any root in the ground:<br>\
(S:) or a shoot on the upper part of a palm-tree,<br>\
hanging down, but not reaching the ground; and<br>\
so ↓ رَاكِبَةٌ and ↓ رَاكُوبَةٌ and ↓ رَكَّابَةٌ: (K:) or,<br>\
as some say, the last of these words is not thus<br>\
applied, but means a woman “ who rides much: ”<br>\
AHn, however, says that it signifies a palm-shoot,<br>\
or the like thereof, growing forth at the top of<br>\
the trunk of a palm-tree, and, in some instances,<br>\
bearing with its mother; but when it is cut off,<br>\
it is better for the mother: and رَاكِبٌ is also<br>\
explained in the L as meaning small palm-trees<br>\
that grow forth at the lower parts of large palmtrees: (TA:) or it means a shoot of a palm-tree<br>\
not cut off from its mother: (Ham p. 66:)<br>\
accord. to As, when a palm-shoot grows from the<br>\
trunk, and does not adhere to the ground, it forms<br>\
a vile kind of palm-tree; and the Arabs call it<br>\
رَاكِبٌ and ↓ رَاكُوبٌ: the pl. of this last [and of<br>\
↓ رَاكُوبَةٌ] is رَوَاكِيبُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  رُكْبَانُ السُّنْبُلِ<br>\
means (tropical:)  What first appear, or grow forth, from<br>\
the قُنْبُع, (A, K, TA,) i. e. the envelope of the<br>\
grain, (TA,) of the ear of wheat. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
رَاكِبٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The head [or summit] of a<br>\
mountain (جَبَل), as in [most of] the copies of<br>\
the K; in some of which is found حَبْل [or rope].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رَاكِبَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also sing. of رَوَاكِبُ (TA) which signifies<br>\
(tropical:)  Streaks [or layers] of fat, (A, K, TA,) overlying one another, (K, TA,) in the fore part of a<br>\
camel&#39;s hump: those in the hinder part are called<br>\
رَوَادِفُ, (A, K, TA,) of which the sing. is رَادِفَةٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رَاكُوبٌ and رَاكُوبَةٌ: see رَاكِبٌ, latter part, in<br>\
four places.<br>\
أَرْكَبُ Large in the رُكْبَة [or knee]. (S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  A camel having one of his knees larger than<br>\
the other. (S, K.)<br>\
أُرْكُوبٌ A company of riders upon camels, (K,)<br>\
or of owners of camels on a journey, or of travellers upon camels, exclusively of other beasts,<br>\
(S,) but more in number than the company called<br>\
رَكْبٌ: (S, K:) pl. أَرَاكِيبُ. (TA.) [See also<br>\
رَكَبَةٌ.]<br>\
مَرْكَبٌ an inf. n. of رَكِبَ. (A, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And also a noun of place [properly signifying A<br>\
place of riding, &amp;c.]. (TA.) [Hence, Anything<br>\
upon which one rides; and upon, or in, which<br>\
one is borne or carried:] one of the مَرَاكِب of<br>\
the land; and [more commonly] of the sea: (S,<br>\
K:) [i. e.] a beast [on which one rides]; (A,<br>\
TA;) and a vessel, i. e. a ship or boat: (A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA:) a saddle; and any kind of vehicle<br>\
borne by a camel or other beast: (the lexicons<br>\
passim:) مَرَاكِبُ is the pl. (Mgh, Msb.) You<br>\
say, نِعْمَ المَرْكَبُ الدَّابَّةُ [Excellent, or most<br>\
excellent, is the thing upon which one rides, the<br>\
beast]. (A.) And جَآءَتْ مَرَاكِبُ اليَمَنِ The<br>\
vessels, or the ships or boats, of El-Yemen came.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence المَرْكَبُ as the name of<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The principal star (a) of Pegasus; because in<br>\
the place of the saddle.]<br>\
مُرْكِبٌ A colt that has become fit for being<br>\
ridden. (TA.) And دَابَّةٌ مُرْكِبَةٌ A beast that<br>\
has attained the age at which one may ride him<br>\
during a warring and plundering expedition.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُرَكَّبٌ A man to whom a horse is lent for a<br>\
portion of the spoil that he may obtain: (IAar,<br>\
TA:) or a man who borrows a horse upon which<br>\
to go forth on a warring and plundering expedition, and who receives one half of the spoil, the<br>\
other half being for the lender: (K:) or one to<br>\
whom a horse has been given for him to ride, and<br>\
who has put his foot into the stirrup. (A.)<br>\
[Also] Weak in the art of horsemanship, or the<br>\
management of horses, and the riding of them.<br>\

-b2-  [Also Put, or set, one part<br>\
upon another: set, or fixed, in another thing:<br>\
composed; constituted; or put together: see its<br>\
verb, 2.] The stone [set] in the signet-ring is<br>\
termed مُرَكَّبٌ and ↓ رَكِيبٌ; and so the arrowhead [fixed] in the shaft: (S:) or رَكِيبٌ signifies, (K, TA,) as a subst., (TA,) a thing set<br>\
(مُرَكَّبٌ) in a thing, such as a ring-stone in the<br>\
