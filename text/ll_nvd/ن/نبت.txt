نَبُتَ, inf. n. نَبْتٌ and<br>\
نَبَاتٌ; [which two ns. see mentioned as substs.;]<br>\
and ↓ تنبّت; (M;) and ↓ انبت; (Fr, S, K;)<br>\
[respecting which last see below;] It (a thing,<br>\
M, or a leguminous [or other] plant, S, K,)<br>\
grew; grew forth; sprouted; vegetated; or germinated. (S, M, K.) As disallows ↓ انبت in<br>\
this sense; but AO allows it, alleging the words<br>\
of Zuheyr, البَقْلُ ↓ حَتَّى إِذَا أَنْبَتَ [Until, when<br>\
the leguminous plants grew]. نَبَتَ and ↓ أَنْبَتَ<br>\
are said to be like مَطَرَتِ السَّمآءُ and أَمْطَرَت. In<br>\
the Kur, xxiii. 20, Ibn-Ketheer, Aboo-&#39;Amr and<br>\
El-Hadremee read تُنْبِتُ: others, تَنْبُتُ: but<br>\
ISd says, that, accord. to the former reading,<br>\
some hold ب, which follows تُنْبِتُ, to be redundant; and others hold that مَا تُنْبُتُ is understood after تُنْبِتُ. Fr holds them to be syn.<br>\

نَبْتٌ and ↓ نَبَاتٌ [properly coll. gen. ns.] are<br>\
syn., (S, K,) [signifying A plant, a herb: and<br>\
plants, herbs, or herbage:] whatever God causes<br>\
to grow, vegetate, or germinate, in the earth:<br>\
(Lth:) the latter is an inf. n. used as a subst.:<br>\
(Lth:) or it is a subst. which is used in the place<br>\
of an inf. n. of أَنْبَتَ: (Fr:) n. un. of the former<br>\
نَبْتَةٌ; (AHn;) [and of the latter نَبَاتَةٌ of which<br>\

and post-classical. (MF.)<br>\
خَبِيتٌ نَبِيتٌ Vile, and contemptible, or despicable: (Lh, K:) said of a man, and of a thing.<br>\
(TA.) In some copies of the K, and in the L,<br>\
instead of حَقِيرٌ, we read فَقِيرٌ, [accord. to which,<br>\
the meaning is vile, and poor]. (TA.)<br>\
نَبِيتَةٌ sing. of نَبَائِتُ, which latter signifies<br>\
the ridges that are raised along the edges of<br>\
rivulets such as are called فُلْجَان (in the CK,<br>\
فَلْجَان) to retain the water: النبائت being expl.<br>\
by أَعْضَادُ الفُلْجَانِ: so in the L, &amp;c.: in several<br>\

نُوَيْبِتَةٌ. (L.) ―<br>\

the sons of such a one are an evil offspring]. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\

manner, condition, or state, in which grow<br>\
(مَا تَنْبُتُ عَلَيْهِ, see 1,) the camels &amp;c., (أَمْوَال)<br>\
and children of the sons of such a one! ―<br>\
-b4-  نَابِتَةٌ<br>\
(TA) and نَوَابِتُ [pl. of the former] (S, K) Inexperienced young men. (S, K.) You say, هٰذَا<br>\

inexperienced young men. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  النَّوَابِتُ The<br>\

مَنْبَتٌ: see مَنْبِتٌ.<br>\
مَنْبِتٌ (tropical:)  Origin, or race, [from which a man<br>\
springs;] syn. أَصْلٌ. (L.) So in the phrase إِنَّهُ لَفِى<br>\
مَنْبِتِ صِدْقٍ (tropical:)  Verily he belongs to an excellent race; is<br>\
of an excellent origin]: and so in the phrase فِى أَكْرَمِ<br>\
المَنَابِتِ [of the most generous of origins, or races.]<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَنْبِتٌ A place in which plants, or<br>\
herbs, grow: (S, K:) dev. from the constant<br>\
course of speech: analogically it should be<br>\
↓ مَنْبَتٌ: (K:) as the aor. of the verb from<br>\
which it is derived is not يَنْبِتُ, with kesreh:<br>\
but there are other examples like it; as مَسجِدٌ<br>\
and مَطْلِعٌ &amp;c.: ↓ مَنْبَتٌ, however, also sometimes<br>\
occurs. (TA.) [Pl. مَنَابِتُ.]<br>\
أَرْضٌ مِنْبَاتٌ [Land abounding with plants, or<br>\
herbage]. (K, voce رَحَبَةٌ, &amp;c.)<br>\
مَنْبُوتٌ (contr. to analogy, S, [for مُنْبَتٌ,]) A<br>\
plant caused to grow, or germinate. (S, K.)<br>\
مُتَنَبِّتٌ Firmly rooted; syn. مُتَأَصِّلٌ. (TA.)<br>\
تَنْبِيتٌ and ↓ تِنْبِيتٌ, (K,) the latter so written,<br>\
not as being so originally, but for the sake of<br>\
agreement in sound [with respect to the first and<br>\
second vowels], (AHei,) a subst., signifying<br>\
What grows or germinates, of slender (i. e. small,<br>\
TA,) trees, [or shrubs,] and large: (K:) ex.,<br>\
بَيْدَآءُ لَمْ يَنْبُتْ بِهَا تَنْبِيتُ<br>\
[A desert in which there grew not aught of shrubs<br>\
or of large trees]: (TA:) young shoots of palmtrees: (IKtt:) the prickles and branches that<br>\
are cut off from a palm-tree, to lighten it.<br>\
(AHn, as from &#39;Eesa Ibn-&#39;Omar.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Pieces of<br>\
the hump of a camel. (L.)<br>\
تِنْبِيثٌ: see تَنْبِيثٌ.<br>\
يَنْبُوتٌ [coll. gen. n.] A certain species of trees:<br>\
(S:) poppy-plants; syn. شَجَرُ الخَشْخَاش: and<br>\
other trees of a large kind: or the trees called<br>\
خرّوب [see below]: (K:) or a kind of thorny<br>\
trees, having branches and leaves, with a fruit of<br>\
the kind called جِرْو, i. e., round; called in &#39;Omán<br>\
غاف: n. un. with ة: AHn says that there are<br>\
two species of ينبوت; one of these is a kind of<br>\
thorny and short trees, also called خَرُّوب [q. v.]<br>\
having a fruit resembling a bubble, in which are<br>\
red grains, having an astringent effect upon the<br>\
bowels, used as a medicine; the other species is a<br>\
large species of trees: ISd says, An Arab of the<br>\
desert, of the tribe of Rabeea, described to me<br>\
the ينبوتة as [a tree] resembling a large apple-tree,<br>\
the leaves of which are smaller than those of the<br>\
apple, having a fruit smaller than the زُعْرُور, intensely black and intensely sweet, with grains, or<br>\
stones, which are put into scales, or balances:<br>\
[evidently meaning the carob, or locust-tree, (see<br>\
خَرُّوب,) whence our term “ carob,” applied to a<br>\
small weight, the twenty-fourth part of a grain].<br>\
