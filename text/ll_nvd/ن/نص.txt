نَصَّ الشَّىْءَ, (S,) aor.<br>\
نَصُ3َ, (Mgh,) inf. n. نَصٌّ,<br>\
(Mgh, TA,) He raised the thing; syn. رَفَعَهُ<br>\
[which is here to be understood, like the English<br>\
equivalent by which I have rendered it, in several<br>\
senses, as the sequel will show]. (S, Mgh, TA.)<br>\
This is the primary signification: (TA:) or,<br>\
accord. to As, it is from نَصَّ النَّاقَةَ, q. v. infra.<br>\
(S.) You say, نَصَّ العَرُوسَ, (M, K,) or نَصَّتْهَا,<br>\
(A, Mgh,) or نَصَّها النِّسَآءُ, (Msb,) aor. as above,<br>\
(A, Mgh,) and so the inf. n., (Msb,) He, or she,<br>\
or the women, raised, (A, Msb,) or seated, (K,)<br>\
or raised and seated, (Mgh,) or showed, or displayed, (M,) the bride upon the مِنَصَّة, (M, A,<br>\
Msb, K,) or upon the مَنَصَّة. (Mgh.) And<br>\
نَصَّتِ الظَّبْيَةُ جِيدَهَا The doe-antelope raised, or<br>\
elevated, her neck. (M, TA.) And نُصَّ فُلَانٌ<br>\
سَيِّدًا (tropical:)  Such a one was set up as a lord, or chief.<br>\
(A, TA.) And نَصَّ المَتَاعَ, (M, K,) inf. n. as<br>\
above, (M,) He put the furniture, or goods, or<br>\
utensils, one upon another. (M, K.) Hence,<br>\
(TA,) نَصَّ الحَدِيثَ, (M, Msb, TA,) or نَصَّهُ إِلَى<br>\
صَاحِبِهِ, (A,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (M, Msb,<br>\
TA,) (tropical:)  He traced up, or ascribed, or attributed,<br>\
the tradition to the author thereof, resting it on<br>\
his authority, by mentioning him, or mentioning,<br>\
uninterruptedly, in ascending order, the persons<br>\
by whom it had been handed down, up to the<br>\
author; or mentioning the person who had related<br>\
it to him from the author, if only one person intervened; syn. رَفَعَهُ; (M, TA;) [i. e.] رَفَعَهُ إِلَى<br>\
مَنْ قَالَهُ: (Msb:) IAar says, (TA,) النَّصُّ signifies الإِسْنَادُ إِلَى الرَّئِيسِ الأَكْبَرِ (tropical:)  [the tracing up, or<br>\
ascribing, or attributing, a tradition, in the manner explained above, to the greatest person of<br>\
authority, here meaning Mohammad, or the author<br>\
of the tradition]; (K, TA;) [i. e.] نَصُّ الحَدِيثِ<br>\
signifies إِسْنَادُهُ وَرَفْعُهُ إِلَى الرَّئِيسِ الأَكْبَرِ. (Mgh.)<br>\
You also say, نَصَّ الحَدِيثَ إِلَيْهِ, (K,) or إِلَى فُلَانٍ,<br>\
(S,) (tropical:)  He ascribed, or attributed, or traced up,<br>\
the tradition to him, or to such a one, in the<br>\
manner explained above; syn. رَفَعَهُ. (S, K.)<br>\
See also أَنَصُّ. ―<br>\
-b2-  نَصَّ الشَّىْءَ (assumed tropical:)  He made the thing<br>\
apparent, manifest, plain, or evident; he showed<br>\
it, exhibited it, manifested it, evinced it, discovered<br>\
it, or revealed it. (M, * K.) [The verb seems<br>\
to be thus used because a thing is rendered conspicuous by being raised. See نَصَّ العَرُوسَ,<br>\
above.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, نَصَّ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مَّا, aor. and<br>\
inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  He, or it, (generally said of a<br>\
passage in the Kur. or a trad.,) made a statement, or a plain, explicit, unequivocal declaration,<br>\
respecting some, or any, particular thing, not<br>\
capable of application to any other thing: and<br>\
he mentioned something, or anything, particularly,<br>\
or specially; he particularized, or specified it by<br>\
words; very frequently used in these senses: and<br>\
such we are to understand from the saying] النَّصُّ<br>\
also signifies التَّوْقِيفُ وَالتَّعْيِينُ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مَّا: (K:)<br>\
[for which I would rather read النَّصَّ عَلَى شَىْءٍ مَّا<br>\
also signifies التَّوْقِيفُ وَالتَّعْيِينُ: adding the observation that التوقيف as syn. with النصّ is restricted<br>\
in art. وقف in the K to a special relation to the<br>\
law: and that النَّصُّ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ is often found<br>\
explained as signifying تَعْيِينُهُ; as, for instance,<br>\
in p. 377 of Har.:] these significations of النَّصُّ<br>\
are tropical, from that word as denoting “ elevation ” and “ appearance. ” (TA.) See also نَصٌّ<br>\
below. ―<br>\
-b4-  [From نَصَّهُ signifying “ he raised it,”<br>\
and consequently “ he made it apparent,” are<br>\
derived several other significations, here following.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  يَنُصُّهُمْ [app. for يَنُصُّ مَا عِنْدَهُمْ] occurs in a<br>\
trad. respecting Heraclius, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He elicits,<br>\
and makes apparent, their opinion: (TA:) or<br>\
نَصَّ الرَّجُلَ, (S, M, &amp;c.,) inf. n. as above, (M,)<br>\
signifies (tropical:)  he went to the utmost point in questioning, or asking, the man respecting a thing, (S, K,)<br>\
so as to elicit what he possessed [of information<br>\
respecting it]; (S;) i. e. (TA) (tropical:)  he importuned<br>\
the man in questioning, or asking, and urged him<br>\
to tell the utmost that he knew; (A, TA;) or (assumed tropical:)  he<br>\
questioned, or asked, the man respecting a thing<br>\
so as to elicit the utmost that he possessed [of information respecting it], (M.) [See also 3.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  [In like manner you say,] نَصَّ النَّاقَةَ, (S, M,<br>\
Mgh, K,) and الدَّابَّةَ, (M, Msb,) aor. as above,<br>\
(M,) and so the inf. n., (S, M,) He made the<br>\
she-camel, and the beast, to exert herself to the<br>\
full, or to the utmost, or beyond measure, in going,<br>\
or pace; or to go the pace termed مَرْفُوع; syn.<br>\
رَفَعَهَا فِى السَّيْرِ: (M, Mgh:) or he elicited her<br>\
utmost pace; (K, TA;) from النَّصُّ as signifying<br>\
الرَّفْعُ; for the phrase رَفَعَهَا فِى السَّيْرِ necessarily<br>\
implies the eliciting the utmost of her celerity of<br>\
pace: (TA:) or he went a vehement pace so as<br>\
to elicit the utmost that she possessed [of celerity[:<br>\
(As, S:) or he put her in motion so as to elicit<br>\
her utmost pace: (A&#39;Obeyd, TA:) or he urged,<br>\
or incited, her, and elicited her pace: (Msb:)<br>\
نَصَّ, alone, also occurs in a trad., (M, Msb,) as<br>\
meaning رَفَعَ نَاقَتَهُ: (M:) and نَاقَتَهُ ↓ نَصْنَصَ signifies the same as نَصَّهَا. (IKtt, TA.) You do<br>\
not say of a camel نَصَّ, making him the agent,<br>\
and the verb intrans. (O, * TA.) [In the M,<br>\
however, I find it said, that النَّصُّ and النَّصِيصُ<br>\
signify السَّيْرُ الشَّدِيدُ; app. indicating that they<br>\
are inf. ns., of which the verb is نَصَّ, aor., accord.<br>\
to rule,<br>\
نَصِ3َ, signifying He went a vehement pace,<br>\
or vehemently: and Golius says, as on the<br>\
authority of Ibn-Maaroof, that this verb is used<br>\
intransitively, with نَصِيصٌ for its inf. n., as signifying valide incessit: but see نَصٌّ below.] ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
[Hence, app.,] النَّصُّ also signifies The urging or<br>\
inciting [a beast]; syn. الحَثُّ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And<br>\
نَصَّ الشَّىْءَ, (M, K,) aor.<br>\
نَصُ3َ, inf. n. نَصٌّ, (TA,) He<br>\
moved the thing; put it in motion, or into a state<br>\
of commotion; agitated it; stirred it; shook it;<br>\
(M, K;) as also ↓ نَصْنَصَهُ. (S, M, K.) Hence<br>\
the saying, فُلَانٌ يَنُصُّ أَنْفَهُ غَضَبًا (K, TA [in the<br>\
CK, incorrectly, يَنِصُّ,]) Such a one moves about<br>\
his nose by reason of anger. (TA.) And ↓ نَصْنَصَ<br>\
لِسَانَهُ He moved about his tongue; (S, M;) like<br>\
نَضْنَضَهُ; (M;) which is a dial. form; (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
S;) the former being the original; the ص not<br>\
being, as some assert it to be, substituted for the<br>\
ض; for these two letters are not of the same kind<br>\
so as to be commutable. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 8.<br>\
2<br>\
نَصَّ3َ see 3.<br>\
3<br>\
ناصّهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُنَاصَّةٌ, (TA,) He (a man,<br>\
TA) went to the utmost length with him, (namely<br>\
his creditor,) in reckoning, so as to omit nothing<br>\
therein; (K, TA;) as also ↓ نصّصهُ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَنْصِيصٌ. (TA.) He (God) went to the utmost<br>\
length with him, (namely a man,) in questioning<br>\
and in reckoning. (TA.) [See also 1.]<br>\
6<br>\
تناصّ القَوْمُ The people, or company of men,<br>\
crowded, thronged, or pressed, together. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
انتصّ He, or it, (said of a camel&#39;s hump,<br>\
Lth, TA,) became raised, or elevated, or high:<br>\
(K, TA:) or (TA) became even and erect. (Lth,<br>\
K, * TA.) [In a copy of the A, the verb in these<br>\
senses, and relating to a camel&#39;s hump, is written<br>\
نَصَّ.] You say also, انتصّت العَرُوسُ, (M, K,)<br>\
or انتصّت على المِنَصَّةِ, (A,) The bride became<br>\
raised, (A,) or seated, (K,) or shown or displayed,<br>\
(M,) upon the مِنَصَّة. (M, A, K.)<br>\
-A2-  He (a<br>\
man, TA) drew himself together; contracted himself; or shrank. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K, TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
نَصْنَصَ, (S, M, K,) inf. n. نَصْنَصَةٌ, (Sh,<br>\
M,) He, or it, became in motion, or in a state of<br>\
commotion; became agitated, stirred, or shaken;<br>\
moved, or moved about,; bestirred himself or itself;<br>\
shook. (Sh.) He (a man) shook in his walk,<br>\
being erect. (M.) He (a camel) shook, or became in a state of commotion, in rising from the<br>\
ground. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also,] said of a camel, it is<br>\
like حَصْحَصَ; (S;) i. e., it signifies (TA) He<br>\
(the camel) fixed, or made firm or steady, his<br>\
knees upon the ground, and put himself in motion,<br>\
or in a state of commotion, previously to rising.<br>\
(Lth, K, TA.) [See also نَضْنَضَ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And He<br>\
(a camel) made a hollow place in the ground with<br>\
his breast, in order to lie down. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
نَصْنَصَ used transitively, see 1, latter portion,<br>\
in three places.<br>\
نَصٌّ The end, or extremity, of anything; (Az,<br>\
S, M;) the utmost, or extreme, extent, term, limit,<br>\
point, or reach, of a thing: this is the primary<br>\
signification. (Az, TA.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
(S, M,) of &#39;Alee, (S,) إِذَا بَلَغَ النِّسَآءُ نَصَّ الحِقَاقِ,<br>\
فَالعَصَبَةُ أَوُلَى بِهَا مِنَ الأُمِّ (S, * M, K, *) or نَصَّ<br>\
الحَقَائِقِ, (K, * TA,) but the former is that which<br>\
is commonly known; (TA;) i. e. When women<br>\
attain the period of mature intellect, (Mbr, S, K,<br>\
TA,) and know the real natures of things, (K, art.<br>\
حق,) [then the male relations on the father&#39;s side<br>\
have a better right to dispose of her in marriage<br>\
than the mother;] meaning, when they attain to<br>\
that age at which they are qualified to contend for<br>\
their rights; [accord. to the former reading;] for<br>\
this is what is termed الحِقَاق: (K, * TA:) or<br>\
when they attain to puberty: (Az, TA:) or when<br>\
they attain to that period at which they become<br>\
objects of contention for right; when every one of<br>\
the guardians asserts himself to have the best right:<br>\
(K:) or الحقاق in the trad. is a metaphorical<br>\
term, from the same word as applied to camels<br>\
[when entering upon the fourth year]; (K, * TA;)<br>\
and الحقائق, also, in this case, accord. to some,<br>\
properly signifies the same, being a pl. of حِقَّةٌ;<br>\
(TA in art. حق;) and the meaning is, when they<br>\
attain to the extreme term of childhood. (M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  In the conventional language of men of science,<br>\
it signifies (tropical:)  A thing [or statement] plainly, or<br>\
explicitly, declared, or made manifest, by God,<br>\
and his Apostle; of the measure فَعْلٌ in the sense<br>\
of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (Msb:) or a نَصّ of the<br>\
Kur-án, and of the traditions, is an expression,<br>\
or a phrase, or a sentence, indicating a particular<br>\
meaning, not admitting any other than it: (TA:)<br>\
so in the conventional language of the lawyers<br>\
and the scholastic theologians: (MF, on the<br>\
خُطْبَة of the K:) or a statute, or an ordinance,<br>\
indicated by the manifest or plain meaning of<br>\
words of the Kur-án, and of the Sunneh: from<br>\
النَّصُّ as denoting “ elevation ” and “ appearance: ”<br>\
or, as some say, from نَصَّهُ as signifying “ he<br>\
elicited, and made apparent, his opinion. ” (TA.)<br>\
Hence, also, as used by the practical lawyers, it<br>\
signifies (tropical:)  An evidence, or a proof: (TA:) [and<br>\
particularly a text of the Kur-án, or of the Sunneh,<br>\
used as an authority in an argument, for proof of<br>\
an assertion.] The pl. [in all these senses] is<br>\
نُصُوصٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also, (assumed tropical:)  The text, or very<br>\
words, of an author, book, writing, or passage:<br>\
frequently used in this sense.]<br>\
-A3-  Hardness, difficulty, or straitness, of an affair, or a state, or case.<br>\
(M, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  سَيْرٌ نَصٌّ, and ↓ نَصِيصٌ, (S, K,) A<br>\
vehement pace, in which a beast is made to exert<br>\
itself to the full, or to the utmost, or beyond<br>\
measure; or in which the utmost possible celerity<br>\
is elicited; [this meaning seems to be indicated,<br>\
though not expressed, in the S;] syn. جِدٌّ رَفِيعٌ:<br>\
(K:) or, the former, as Az says, in one place, a<br>\
kind of swift pace: or, as he says in another place,<br>\
the utmost pace which a beast of carriage is able<br>\
to attain: (TA:) or نَصٌّ and ↓ نَصِيصٌ signify a<br>\
vehement pace or going. (M.) See 1.<br>\
نَصِيصٌ: see نَصٌّ, last sentence, in two places.<br>\
هَوُ نَصَّاصُ الأَنْفِ He is one who moves about his<br>\
nose [much] by reason of anger. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
حَيَّةٌ نَصْنَاصٌ A serpent that moves about much.<br>\
(K.) [See also نَضْنَاضٌ.]<br>\
أَنَصُّ [a comparative and superlative epithet<br>\
from نَصَّ الحَدِيثَ, q. v.]. &#39;Amr Ibn-Deenár<br>\
said, مَا رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا أَنَصَّ لِلْحَدِيثِ مِنَ الزُّهْرِىِّ I<br>\
have not seen a man more skilled in tracing up,<br>\
or ascribing, or attributing, a tradition to its<br>\
author, in the manner explained above, (voce نَصَّ,)<br>\
than Ez-Zuhree; i. q. أَرْفَعَ لَهُ and أَسْنَدَ. (TA.)<br>\
مَنَصَّةٌ: see what next follows, throughout.<br>\
مِنَصَّةٌ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) or ↓ مَنَصَّةٌ, (Mgh,)<br>\
The thing upon which a bride is raised (S, * A, K)<br>\
and seated, (Mgh,) or shown or displayed, (M,)<br>\
or upon which she stands (تقف [but this is probably a mistake for تَقْعُدُ, i. e. sits,]) when displayed<br>\
to the bridegroom, (Msb,) in order that she may<br>\
be seen (M, Mgh) [and distinguished] from among<br>\
the women; (Mgh;) being a chair, (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA,) or couch; (TA;) or consisting of pieces of<br>\
cloth raised, and carpets laid smoothly for a seat:<br>\
(M:) written with kesr (Msb, K) as being an<br>\
instrument, (Msb,) or with fet-h [as being a place]:<br>\
(Mgh:) accord. to some authorities, مِنَصَّةٌ and<br>\
مَنَصَّةٌ seem to signify the same thing: (TA:) or<br>\
the latter is the حَجَلَة [i. e. a kind of curtained<br>\
canopy] (K, TA) over the مِنَصَّة: (TA:) from<br>\
نَصَّ المَتَاعَ, q. v. (K.) It is said in a proverb,<br>\
وُضِعَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى المِنَصَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one was exposed<br>\
to disgrace and infamy: (TA:) or to the utmost<br>\
disgrace and infamy. (M.)<br>\
