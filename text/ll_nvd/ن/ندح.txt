(A, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the saying of Umm-Selemeh<br>\
to &#39;Aïsheh, (when she desired to go forth to<br>\
El-Basrah, TA,) قَدْ جَمَعَ القُرْآنُ ذَيْلَكِ فَلَا<br>\
تَنْدَحِيهِ, i. e., [The Kur-án hath drawn together,<br>\
or contracted, thy skirt; therefore] do not widen<br>\
it, (S, L, K,) or do not spread it abroad, (L,)<br>\
by thy going forth to El-Basrah: (S, L, K:)<br>\
the pronoun ه refers to the word ذيل: the<br>\
speaker alluded to the words of the Kur-án,<br>\
[xxxiii. 33,] وَقَرْنَ فِى بُيُوُتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ.<br>\

فَنَدَحَ He became possessed of wealth like the<br>\

9<br>\
إِنْدَحَّ بَطْنُهُ, inf. n. إِنْدِحَاحٌ, His belly became<br>\
distended by reason of repletion. (S.) This, says<br>\
IB, is its proper art., not art. دح. (TA, art. دح,<br>\
in which J also mentions it.) F says, that J is<br>\
in error in mentioning this verb, as also in mentioning إِنْدَاحَ بَطْنُهُ, inf. n. إِنْدِيَاحٌ, in the present<br>\
art.; the proper place of the former being in art.<br>\
دح; and that of the latter, in art. دوح: but MF<br>\
says, that J has merely mentioned them here because of the resemblance of their radical letters<br>\
and significations to the radical letters and significations belonging to this art. (TA.)<br>\
