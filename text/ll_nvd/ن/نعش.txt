نَعَشَهُ, aor.<br>\
نَعَشَ, (S, K,) inf. n. نَعْشٌ, (S,) He<br>\
(God) raised him; lifted him up; (S, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ انعشهُ; (Lth, Ks, K;) which is disallowed<br>\
by ISk, who says that it is a vulgar word, and<br>\
by J after him, but is correct; (TA;) and ↓ نعّشهُ,<br>\
(AA, K,) inf. n. تَنْعِيشٌ: (AA, TA:) or He<br>\
(God) set him up, or upright; as also ↓ انعشهُ:<br>\
(Msb:) [see an ex. in a verse cited voce شَمْلٌ:]<br>\
or be [app. a man] raised him, or lifted him up,<br>\
after a stumble, or trip. (Sb.) You say also,<br>\
نَعَشْتُ الشَّجَرَةَ I set the tree upright, when it was<br>\
leaning. (TA.) And نَعَشَ طَرُفهُ He raised his<br>\
eye, or eyes. (S, * K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] aor. and inf.<br>\
n. as above, (TA,) (tropical:)  He recovered him from his<br>\
embarrassment, or difficulty: (A:) (tropical:)  he restored<br>\
him from a state of poverty to wealth, or competence, or sufficiency: (K, TA;) as also ↓ انعشهُ:<br>\
(TA:) and (tropical:)  he recovered him from a state of<br>\
perdition or destruction. (TA.) And نَعَشَكَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  May God restore thee from poverty to wealth,<br>\
or competence, or sufficiency: or make thee to continue in life; preserve thee alive. (A.) And<br>\
↓ انعشهُ (assumed tropical:)  He set him up, and strengthened his<br>\
heart. (TA.) And الرَّبِيعُ يُنْعشُ النَّاسَ (tropical:)  (A,<br>\
TA,) [The spring, or spring-herbage, or the season,<br>\
or rain, called الربيع,] makes men to live and enjoy<br>\
plenty of herbage or the like. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence<br>\
also,] نَعَشَ المَيِّتَ, (Sh, K,) aor. as above, (Sh,)<br>\
and so the inf. n. (TA) (tropical:)  He eulogized, or praised,<br>\
the dead man, (Sh, K,) and exalted his praise, or<br>\
fame, or honour. (Sh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  نَعَشُوا المَيِّتَ also<br>\
signifies They carried the dead man upon the<br>\
نَعْش, q. v. (A [where this signification is indicated,<br>\
but not expressed: it is shown, however, by an<br>\
explanation of pass. part. n. (q. v. infra) in the<br>\
TA.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  نُعِشَ عَلَى جِنَارَتِهَا A نَعْش [q. v.] was<br>\
made for her bier. (Mgh, from a trad. of, or<br>\
relating to, Fátimeh.)<br>\
2<br>\
نَعّشهُ: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  Also, (K,) or نعّش لَهُ, (S,)<br>\
inf. n. تَنْعِيشٌ, (K,) He said to him نَعَشَكَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
[which see above, in 1, and also below, in 8]:<br>\
(S, K:) in [some copies of] the S, نَعَّشَكَ الله.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَنْعَشَ see 1, in four places.<br>\
8<br>\
انتعش He rose; or became raised, or lifted<br>\
up: (TA:) he rose after his stumble, or trip: (S,<br>\
A, Msb, K:) and in like manner you say of a<br>\
bird, (A, TA,) meaning it rose [after falling or<br>\
alighting], (TA,) and he raised his head. (TA.)<br>\
Hence the saying, تَعَسَ فَلا انْتَعَشَ May he fall,<br>\
having stumbled, or stumble and fall, and not rise<br>\
[again]: a form of imprecation. (TA.) And<br>\
hence the saying of &#39;Omar, اِنْتَعِشْ نَعَشَكَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
Rise thou: may God raise thee: or نعشك اللّٰه<br>\
has here one of the two meanings assigned to it<br>\
before, in 1. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] (tropical:)  He recovered, or became recovered, from his embarrassment, or difficulty. (A, TA.)<br>\
نَعْشٌ A state of elevation, or exaltation. (Sh.)<br>\
See 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  A state of remaining; lastingness;<br>\
endurance; permanence; or continuance; syn.<br>\
بَقَآءٌ. (Sh, K.)<br>\
-A2-  [A kind of litter, or] a thing<br>\
resembling a مِحَفَّة, upon which the king used to<br>\
be carried. when sick: (IDrd, Msb, K:) not the<br>\
نَعْش of a corpse. (IDrd, Msb.) This is said to<br>\
be the primary application. (TA) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,<br>\
(TA,) A bier, (S, A, Msb, K,) when the corpse<br>\
is upon it. for otherwise it is called سرِيرٌ: (S, IAth,<br>\
Msb:) it is called by the former name because of<br>\
its height, or its being raised: (S, TA.) pl.<br>\
نُعُوشٌ: (Msb:) also, a reticulated thing. (Az.<br>\
Mgh, TA,) resembling a محَفّة, (Mgh,) which is<br>\
put as a cover over a [dead] woman when she is<br>\
placed upon the bier; (Az, Mgh, TA;) but this<br>\
is properly called حَرَجٌ, though people called is<br>\
نَعْشٌ, which is properly only the bier itself. (Az,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence,] بَنَاتُ نَعْشِ الكُبْرَى [or بَنَاتُ<br>\
نَعْشَ الكُبْرَى, together with نَعْشٌ or نَعْشُ, constitute<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The constellation of Ursa Major: or the principal stars thereof:] seven stars; whereof four<br>\
[which are in the body] are called نَعْشٌ [or نَعْشُ],<br>\
and three [which are in the tail] are called بَناتٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) i. e., بنات نعش (TA:) and to like<br>\
manner الصُّغْرَى, (K,) or بنات نعش الصُّغْرَى<br>\
[together with نعش الصُّغْرَى constitute [the constellation of Ursa Minor: or the principal stars<br>\
thereof; seven in number; whereof the four in the<br>\
body are called نعش, and the there in the tail are<br>\
called بنات]: (S:) [the former four] said to be<br>\
likened to the bearers of a bier, because they form<br>\
a square: (IDrd, TA:) [the بنات being so called<br>\
as being likened to damsels or to men for بنات<br>\
is pl. of اِبْنٌ applied to an irrational thing as well<br>\
as pl. of بِنْتٌ) following a bier:] Sb and Fr agree<br>\
that نعش is imperfectly decl. because determinate<br>\
and of the fem. gender: (S:) or it is perfectly<br>\
decl. when indeterminate, but not when determinate [by having the epithet الكُبْرَى or الصُّغْرَى<br>\
added to it]: (Aboo-&#39;Amr Ez-Záhid, K:) بَنو نَعْشِ<br>\
also occurs, in poetry; (Sb, S, K;) because a<br>\
single one [of the stars thereof] is called ابْنُ نَعْشِ,<br>\
(Lth, K,) being made to accord. in gender with<br>\
كَوْكَبٌ; but when they say ثَلَاث or أَرْبَع, they<br>\
say بَنَات: (Lth, TA:) [this is agreeable with a<br>\
general rule; accord. to which, بَنَاتٌ is the pl. of<br>\
اِبْنٌ applied to anything but a human being:]<br>\
the pl. of بنات نعش is النَّوَاعِشُ; like as أَبَارِصُ is<br>\
pl. of سَامُّ أَبَرَصَ. (L, TA.) See also نُعَيْشٌ. ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
Also نَعْشٌ A piece of wood, (K, TA,) of the length<br>\
of twice the stature of a man, (TA,) upon the head<br>\
of which is a piece of rag, (K, TA,) called حَرَجٌ,<br>\
(TA,) with which young ostriches are hunted or<br>\
captured. (K, TA.)<br>\
نُعَيْشٌ [or نُعَيْشُ (assumed tropical:)  The small star called] السُّهَى,<br>\
which is [by the star (??)] in the middle of بَنَات نَعْش.<br>\
So in the saying, هُوَ أَخْفَى مِنْ نُعَيْش فِى بَنَاتِ نَعْش<br>\
[He, or it, is more obscure than No&#39;eysh among<br>\
the Bená Naash]. (A, TA.)<br>\
النَّوَاعِشُ: see نَعْشٌ, near the end.<br>\
مَنْعُوشٌ A corpse carried upon a نَعْش, or bier.<br>\
(S, A, * Msb.)<br>\
