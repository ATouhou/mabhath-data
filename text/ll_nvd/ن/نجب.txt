نَجَبَ الشَّجَرَةَ, aor.<br>\
نَجِبَ and<br>\
نَجُبَ, inf. n. نَجْبٌ, He<br>\
took off the bark of the stem, or trunk, of the tree:<br>\
(S:) or نَجَبَهُ, aor. and inf. n. as above; and<br>\
↓ نجّبه, inf. n. تَنْجِيبٌ; and ↓ انتجبه; He took off<br>\
its bark; barked it. (ISd, K.) See نَجَبٌ.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
نَجُبَ, aor.<br>\
نَجُبَ, inf. n. نَجَابَةٌ, He was generous,<br>\
noble, or liberal, &amp;c.: [see نَجِيبٌ]. (Msb, K.)<br>\
He, or it, was excellent, or choice. (MA.)<br>\
[Said of a horse and the like, He was generous,<br>\
excellent, strong, light, or swift.] ―<br>\
-b2-  نَاجَبَهُ فَنَجَبَهُ:<br>\
see 3.<br>\

نَجَّبَ see 1.<br>\
3<br>\
نَاْجَبَ ↓ نَاجَبَهُ فَنَجَبَهُ [He vied with him, or strove<br>\
to surpass him, in generosity, nobleness, or liberality; and he surpassed him therein.] (TA,<br>\
art. خير.)<br>\
4<br>\
انجب He begot a generous, noble, or liberal,<br>\
child; such as is termed نَجِيبٌ. (S.) [This<br>\
verb, being coupled in the K with نَجُبَ, might<br>\
be imagined syn. therewith; but this, accord. to<br>\
the TA, is not the case.] El-Aashà says,<br>\
أَنْجَبَ أَزْمَانَ وَالِدَاهُ بِهِ<br>\
إِذْ نَجَلَاهُ فَنِعْمَ مَا نَجَلَا<br>\
(S) He begot a generous son in the times when his<br>\
parents (rejoiced) in him, when they produced him;<br>\
and excellent was that which they produced.<br>\
Accord. to one reading, the second word is أَيَّامَ:<br>\
and أَيَّامُ وَالِدَيْهِ is also read in place of ازمان والداه;<br>\
in which case, ايَّام is fig. the agent of انجب.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  انجبت is said of a woman, in the same<br>\
sense. (TA.) See also انخب. ―<br>\
-b3-  انجب [as<br>\
also انخب] He begot a cowardly child: (from<br>\
نَجَبٌ, the “ bark ” of a tree: TA:) thus the<br>\
verb bears two contr. significations: (K:) or the<br>\
two significations are not necessarily contr.; for<br>\
a courageous man may be not generous, or liberal;<br>\
and a generous, or liberal, man may be not<br>\
courageous. (MF.)<br>\
8<br>\
انتجبهُ He selected him; chose him; (S;)<br>\
preferred him above others. (TA.) See also<br>\
انتخب. ―<br>\
-b2-  See 1. ―<br>\
-b3-  ذَهَبَ يَنْتَجِبُ He went to<br>\
collect [the kind of bark called] نَجَبٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
A poet says,<br>\
يَا أَيُّهَا الزَّاعِمُ أَنِّى أَجْتَلِبْ<br>\
وَأَنَّنِى غَيْرَ عِضَاهِى أَنْتَجِبْ<br>\
meaning, O thou who assertest that I take the<br>\
verses of other poets and appropriate them to<br>\
myself, and, and as it were, take the bark of other<br>\
trees than my own &#39;idáh, to tan therewith...<br>\
(TA.) [See عِضَاهُ.]<br>\
نَجْبٌ: see نَجِيبٌ.<br>\
نَجَبٌ The bark (لِحَآء) of trees: (S, K:) or the<br>\
rind of the roots thereof: or of what is hard<br>\
thereof. (K.) The soft peel of branches is not<br>\
thus called; nor is the rind of roots called قِشْر,<br>\
but نجب: n. un. نَجَبَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
نَجْبَةُ نَمْلَةٍ A bite of an ant. So in a trad.,<br>\
accord. to one reading: accord. to another reading,<br>\
it is نَخْبَة. Both these words are given by IAth<br>\
on the authority of Z. (TA.)<br>\
نُجَبَةٌ and نَجَبَةٌ: see نَجِيبٌ.<br>\
نَجِيبٌ A generous, noble, liberal, man; (S, K;)<br>\
one distinguished by rank or quality, nobility or<br>\
eminence, reputation or note or consideration;<br>\
(K;) excellent; of great worth in his kind; one<br>\
who is like his father in generosity and actions:<br>\
(TA:) as also ↓ نَجْبٌ (K) [explained as signifying “ liberal, generous ”] and ↓ نُجَبَةٌ: (S, K:)<br>\
or you call a man نجيب when he is generous,<br>\
noble, or liberal; but when he is unequalled<br>\
among his people in generosity, &amp;c., you say<br>\
قَوْمِهِ ↓ هُوَ نَجَبَةُ, in measure like حَلَمَة: (El-&#39;Alam<br>\
Es-Sakháwee:) [but MF doubts the correctness of this measure; and seems to think that the<br>\
correct word is ↓ نُجَبَة:] القَوْمِ ↓ هو نُجَبَةُ is said<br>\
of a man when he is the man, among them, who<br>\
is distinguished by generosity, &amp;c.: (S:) pl.<br>\
نُجَبَآءُ and أَنْجَابٌ and نُجُبٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَجِيبٌ<br>\
Excellent, as an epithet applied to any animal;<br>\
(IAth;) a generous, excellent, camel or horse;<br>\
one of high breed; (ISd;) a strong, light, swift,<br>\
camel: (TA:) you say نَاقَةٌ نَجِيبَةٌ as well as<br>\

(S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  نَجَائِبُ القُرْآنِ The most excellent, and the<br>\
purest, parts of the Kur-án. Of such is the<br>\
سُورَةُ الأَنْعَام. (TA.) In like manner, ↓ نَوَاجِبُهُ<br>\
The heart thereof that has [as it were] no نَجَب<br>\
[or bark] upon it: or the best, or most excellent,<br>\
thereof. (K.)<br>\
نَوَاجِبُ: see what next precedes.<br>\
مُنْجِبٌ A man who begets generous, noble, or<br>\
liberal, children; such as are termed نُجَبَاءُ. (K.)<br>\
In like manner, اِمْرَأَةٌ مُنْجِبَةٌ, and ↓ مِنْجَابٌ: (S,<br>\
K:) pl. of the latter مَنَاجِيبُ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ↓ منجاب<br>\
also signifies A woman who has generous, noble,<br>\
or liberal, children; such as are termed نجبآء.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مِنْجَابٌ A weak man: (S, K:) pl. مَنَاجِيبُ.<br>\

(K:) a capacious vessel of the kind called قَدَحٌ:<br>\
(S:) or wide, or capacious, in the bottom: i. q.<br>\
مَنْجُوفٌ, which, accord. to ISd, is the correct<br>\
word; but others say that the ب and ف<br>\
may be interchangeable. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  جِلْدٌ مَنْجُوبٌ<br>\
A hide tanned with the bark of the trunk of the<br>\
طَلْح. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  سِقَاءٌ منجوبٌ A skin tanned with<br>\

called] نَجَبٌ: (K:) as also نَجَبِىٌّ (S, K) and<br>\
مِنْجَبٌ: (Aboo-Mis-hal, K:) but the last is disapproved by ISd, because it is of the measure<br>\
مِفْعَلٌ, which is not used in the sense of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولٌ. (TA.)<br>\
مُنْتَجَبٌ Select; chosen; choice: (K:) an epithet applied to anything. (TA.)<br>\
