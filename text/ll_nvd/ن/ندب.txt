نَدَبَهُ لِلْأَمْرِ, (S,) or إِلَى الأَمْرِ, aor.<br>\
نَدُبَ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. نَدْبٌ; (Msb, TA;) and ↓ انتدبه<br>\
للامر; this latter verb being used transitively<br>\
as well as intransitively; (Msb;) He, or<br>\
it, called, summoned, or invited, him to the<br>\
thing; (S, Msb, K;) and instigated, incited, or<br>\
urged, him to it: (K.) i. e., to war, succour,<br>\
&amp;c. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [You say,] مَا نَدَبَنِى إِلَى مَا<br>\
فَعَلْتُ إِلَّا النُّصْحُ لَكَ (tropical:)  Nothing incited me to do<br>\
what I have done but sincerity towards thee. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  نَدَبَهُ إِلَى أَمْرٍ, [and لِأَمْرٍ; and ↓ ندّبهُ; (see<br>\
مَنْدُوبٌ;)] He sent him to do a thing. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
نَدَبَ المَيِّتَ, (aor.<br>\
نَدُبَ, inf. n. نَدْبٌ, S,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
wailed for, wept for, or deplored the loss of, the<br>\
dead man, and enumerated his good qualities and<br>\
actions. (S, K.) نَدَبُتِ الميّب (tropical:)  She (a wailing<br>\
woman) called upon the dead man, praising him,<br>\
and saying وَافُلَانَاهُ and وَاهَنَاهُ, Alas for such a<br>\
one! and Alas for thee! (M) or she, as it were,<br>\
called upon the dead man, enumerating his good<br>\
qualities and actions, as though he heard her.<br>\
(Msb.) It is said that the action is peculiarly<br>\
that of women; and that the verb is derived<br>\
from نَدَبَهُ, “he called him ” to do a thing; or<br>\
from نَدَبٌ, “a scar,” because the wailer mentions<br>\
the memorials of him who has gone; or perhaps<br>\
from نَدْبٌ, “lightness, or activity. ” (MF.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
نَدِبَ, aor.<br>\
نَدَبَ, (inf. n. نَدَبٌ, TA;) and ↓ اندب; It<br>\
(a wound) had a hardened scar, such as is termed<br>\
نَدَبَة. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَدِبَ, aor.<br>\
نَدَبَ, inf. n. نَدَبٌ [so<br>\
accord. to the TA, agreeably with analogy; but<br>\
in the CK and a MS. copy, نَدْبٌ; whence, and<br>\
from the form of the latter of the two inf. ns.<br>\
here following, it seems not improbable that the<br>\
verb may be also written نَدَبَ;] and نُدُوبَةٌ and<br>\
نُدُوبٌ, It (the back) had upon it scars, such as<br>\
are termed نُدُوب. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  نَدُبَ, aor.<br>\
نَدُبَ, inf. n.<br>\
نَدَابَةٌ, TA,) He was light, or active, (and quick,<br>\
TA,) in the accomplishment of affairs, or wants:<br>\
he was clever, ingenious, or acute in mind; excellent. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
ندّب He took, got, or won, a bet, wager, or<br>\
stake. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See 1.<br>\
4<br>\
اندبهُ It (a wound) made, or left, a scar<br>\
upon him. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He made a scar upon his<br>\
skin. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See بَدَبٌ. ―<br>\

انتدب لَهُ He answered, or complied with,<br>\
or obeyed, his call, summons, or invitation, (S,)<br>\
and hastened to him, when called to war, succour,<br>\
&amp;c. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  انتدب اللّٰهُ لِمَنْ خَرَجَ فِى سَبِيلِهِ<br>\
(occurring in a trad., TA,) God answereth his<br>\
prayer for forgiveness [who goeth forth to fight<br>\
for the sake of his religion]: or is surety, or<br>\
guarantee, for him: or hasteneth to grant him<br>\
a good recompense: or graciously maketh his<br>\
completion of that [recompense] to him necessary<br>\
and sure. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  انتدبوا إِلَيْهِ They hastened<br>\
to him, either at his call, or summons, or<br>\
of their own accord. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  خُذْ مَا انتدب<br>\

itself without difficulty: (AA, K:) as also ما<br>\
انتدم. (TA.) ―<br>\

him in his speech. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  إِيَّاكُمْ وَرِضَاعَ السَّوْءِ<br>\
فَإِنَّهُ لَا بُدَّ مِنْ أَنْ يَنْتَدِبَ Beware of giving your<br>\
children to a bad nurse; for it [that is the evil<br>\
consequence, or the bad qualities that will be<br>\
acquired,] will inevitably appear some day. Said<br>\
by &#39;Omar. (TA.)<br>\
نَدْبٌ A man who is light, or active, (and<br>\
quick, TA,) in the accomplishment of an affair,<br>\
or a want; (S, K;) as also ↓ مِنْدَبَى (K) and<br>\
↓ مِنْدِبَى: (TA:) a man who, when he is sent to<br>\
accomplish a great, or an important, affair, finds<br>\
it light to him: (A:) clever, ingenious, or acute<br>\
in mind; excellent: pl. نُدُوبٌ and نُدَبَاءُ: (K:)<br>\
the former agreeable with analogy; the latter<br>\
formed from the imaginary sing. نَدِيبٌ; like<br>\
سُمَحَاءُ, pl. of سَمْحٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَدْبٌ, as applied<br>\
to a horse, Sharp-spirited; (Lth, S;) contr. of<br>\
بَلِيدٌ (Lth) excellent. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  نَدْبٌ Lightness,<br>\
or activity. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b4-  أَرَاكَ نَدْبًا فِى الحَوَائِجِ<br>\
[I see thee to be clever in accomplishing affairs,<br>\
or wants. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  See نَدَبٌ.<br>\
نَدَبٌ, (S, K,) and, by poetical licence, ↓ نَدْبٌ,<br>\
(MF,) The scar, (S,) or scars, (K,) of a wound,<br>\
(S, K,) not rising above the surrounding skin:<br>\
(S:) accord. to the K, pl. نَدَبَةٌ [which is written<br>\
in several MS. copies of the K نَدْبَةٌ; and so in<br>\
the CK; but this, accord. to the TA, is incorrect;] but it is a coll. gen. n., of which the<br>\
n. un. is نَدَبَةٌ, like as شَجَرَةٌ is that of شَجَرٌ:<br>\
(MF:) pl. أَنْدَابٌ and نُدُوبٌ: (K:) the former<br>\
of نَدَبٌ agreeably with analogy: the latter dev.<br>\
with respect to analogy; or pl. of نَدْبٌ. (MF.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  نَدَبٌ is also applied, in a trad., to the<br>\
(tropical:)  Marks made by Moses&#39; smiting the stone [from<br>\
which, thereupon, water flowed forth]; these<br>\
marks being thus likened to the scars of wounds.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  نَدَبٌ is also employed to signify<br>\
(tropical:)  Scars upon men&#39;s reputation. A poet says,<br>\
قَوْمٌ سَأَتْرُكُ فِى أَعْرَاضِهِمْ نَدَبَا<br>\
A people upon whose reputation I will leave scars,<br>\
the effects of my satires. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  نَدَبٌ The<br>\
direction in which one shoots an arrow or<br>\
arrows: syn. رِشْقٌ. (So in the S and the CK<br>\
and several MS. copies of the K: in other copies,<br>\
رَشْقٌ The act of shooting an arrow or arrows.<br>\
Both these readings are correct accord. to the<br>\
TA. See below.) إِرْتَمَى نَدَبًا أَوْ نَدَبَيْنِ He<br>\
shot an arrow or arrows in one direction or in<br>\
two directions: syn. وَجْهًا أَوْ وَجْهَيْنِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
نَدَبُنَا يَوْمَ كَذَا (said by those who are to contend<br>\
at a shooting-match, TA,) The day of our commencing shooting shall be such a day. (K.) This<br>\
confirms the assertion in the TA, that نَدَبٌ is<br>\
syn. with رَشْقٌ, as well as with رِشْقٌ. In the<br>\
Turk. K, in the place of يَوْمَ ابْتِدَائِنَا, we find<br>\
يوم انْتِدَابِنَا; and Freytag adopts the latter<br>\
reading; but I find no other authority for it.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  نَدَبٌ A bet, wager, stake, or thing wagered;<br>\
what is staked at a shooting match, or a race,<br>\
and taken by the winner: (S, * K, * L:) pl. أَنْدَابٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) So in the following phrases. ―<br>\
-b4-  بَيْنَهُمْ<br>\
نَدَبٌ [Between them is a bet, or wager]. ―<br>\
-b5-  أَقَامَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ عَلَى نَدَبٍ [Such a one stood to a bet,<br>\
wager, or stake]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  &#39;Orweh says,<br>\
أَيَهْلِكُ مُعْتَمٌّ وَزَيْدٌ وَلَمْ أُقِمْ<br>\
عَلَى نَذَبٍ يَوْمًا وَلِى نَفْسُ مُخْطِرِ<br>\
[Shall Moatemm and Zeyd perish, and I not<br>\
stand to a stake, some day, when I have the soul<br>\
of one who makes his life a stake to his adversary<br>\
and sallies forth against him?] These two were<br>\
his ancestors. (S.) Or, accord. to Az, who reads<br>\
أَتَهْلِكُ, they were two tribes. (TA.)<br>\
نَدِبٌ: see نَدِيبٌ.<br>\
نَدْبَةٌ [a fem. epithet] Any camel&#39;s foot, or hoof,<br>\
[meaning any camel, or hoofed beast,] that does<br>\
not remain in one state. (K.)<br>\
نُدْبَةٌ, a subst., A call; a summons; an invitation to do a thing. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نُدْبَةٌ: a subst.,<br>\
(tropical:)  The act of wailing for, weeping for, lamenting,<br>\
or deploring the loss of, one who is dead, as<br>\
described in the explanations of نَدَبَ الميّت, and<br>\
بَدَبَتْه. (S, K, M, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [هَآءُ النَّدْبَةِ The ه<br>\
of lamentation].<br>\
-A2-  عَرَبِىٌّ نُدْبَةٌ An Arabian of<br>\
chaste speech; (K;) eloquent. (TA.)<br>\
نَدِيبٌ, (K,) or ↓ نَدِبٌ, (L,) A back having<br>\
upon it scars, such as are termed نُدُوب: (L, K:)<br>\
the former epithet is also applied in the same<br>\
sense to a wound: and, so applied, is also explained by the word مَنْدُوبٌ: (TA:) [app. meaning that will be wailed for, or deplored; i. e.,<br>\
fatal].<br>\
نَادِبَةٌ (tropical:)  A wailing woman; or one wailing for,<br>\
weeping for, or deploring the loss of, one who is<br>\
dead, as described in the explanations of نَدَبَ<br>\
الميّت, and نَدَبَتْهُ: (M, Msb:) pl. نَوَادِبُ. (Msb.)<br>\
النَّدَّابَتَانِ a name given to Two bad marks in<br>\
horses. (TA.)<br>\
مَنْدَبٌ A place to which one is called, summoned, or invited. Hence بَابُ المَنْدَبِ [The<br>\
Strait Báb el-Mendeb, or The Strait of the Place<br>\
of Summons:] so called because a certain king<br>\
summoned a number of men to break through<br>\
the mountain there, which originally opposed a<br>\
barrier to the sea, in order to drown his enemy;<br>\
and this they did, thus overwhelming with the<br>\
waters many cities and towns with their inhabitants, and forming the sea which intervenes<br>\
between El-Yemen and Abyssinia, and which<br>\
extends to &#39;Eydháb and Kuseyr [&amp;c.]. (Yaakoot.)<br>\
This king was Alexander the Greek! (TA.) [It<br>\
is probable that the appearance of the Strait gave<br>\
rise to this story, and thus to its name: but it is<br>\
also probable that the name may signify The<br>\
Strait of the Place of Wailing for the Dead; as<br>\
many perish who go forth from it.]<br>\
مَنْدَبَى and مِنْدِبَى: see نَدْبٌ.<br>\
مُنَدَّبٌ: see مَنْدُوبٌ.<br>\
مَنْدُوبٌ One sent to do a thing; a messenger; an envoy; an ambassador. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
فُلَانٌ مَنْدُوبٌ لِأَمْرٍ عَظِيمٍ, and لَهُ ↓ مُنَدَّبٌ, Such<br>\
a one is sent to do a great thing; or to perform an<br>\
important affair. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ↓ مُنَدَّبَةٌ an appellation,<br>\
given by the people of Mekkeh to their Envoys,<br>\
or ambassadors, to the palace of the Khaleefeh.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  مَنْدُوبٌ Desired; sought; sought after;<br>\
as the name of a certain horse it is thus explained: from نَدَبٌ, as signifying “ a pledge<br>\
that is given on the occasion of a race. ” (L.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
مَنْدُوبٌ: see نَدَبَ الميّت: A thing bewailed, [or<br>\
complained of as painful,] with the exclamation<br>\
of يَا or وَا. O! or Alas! (KT.) [The name of<br>\
the thing thus bewailed, or complained of, has<br>\
always an ا of prolongation and ه annexed to it,<br>\
or the ا only.] ―<br>\
-b6-  مَنْدُوبٌ, originally مَنْدُوبٌ إِلَيْهِ,<br>\
A thing to the performance of which one is called,<br>\
summoned, or invited: (Msb:) [hence,] approved:<br>\
(K:) a signification verified by the doctors of practical law: (TA:) a thing the doing of which is more<br>\
excellent than the leaving it undone, in the eye of<br>\
the prescriber of the law, but which it is allowable<br>\
to leave undone. (KT.) [Freytag, in quoting<br>\
the original words, omits فِعْلُهُ before راجحًا.]<br>\
