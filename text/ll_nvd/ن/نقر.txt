نَقَرَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
نَقُرَ, inf. n. نَقْرٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) He (a bird) pecked, or picked up, (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K,) a grain, (S,) or grains, (A, Msb,) from<br>\
this place and that, (A, K,) بِمِنْقَارِهِ with his beak.<br>\
(A.) [Accord. to the TA, the addition “ from<br>\
this place and that,” which is found in the K and<br>\
A, and in one place in the S, seems to be unnecessary. And ↓ انتقر signifies the same: see 8,<br>\
in art. قب.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, because of the sure aim<br>\
with which a bird pecks a thing,] the same verb,<br>\
having the same [aor. and] inf. n. signifies, (tropical:)  It<br>\
(an arrow) hit the butt. (Msb.) And He (an<br>\
archer) hit the butt, without making his arrow to<br>\
pass through, partly or wholly. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence<br>\
also,] (assumed tropical:)  He took [or picked] a thing, as, for<br>\
instance, food, with the finger. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also,<br>\
(M, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (M, TA,) He<br>\
struck a thing (IKtt, K, * TA,) with a thing:<br>\
(IKtt, TA:) [generally, he struck, knocked, or<br>\
pecked, a thing with a pointed instrument, like as<br>\
a bird strikes a thing with its beak:] he struck<br>\
[or pecked] a mill-stone, or a stone, &amp;c., with a<br>\
مِنْقَار [which is a pick, or a kind of pickaxe; i. e.,<br>\
he wrought it into shape, and roughened it in its<br>\
surface, with a pick]. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence,]<br>\
(tropical:)  He wrote [or engraved writing] فِى حَجَرٍ upon<br>\
a stone. (A, K.) Whence the saying, التَّعْلِيمُ<br>\
فِى الصِّغَرِ كَالنَّقْرِ عَلَى الحَجَرِ [or, as in a verse of<br>\
Niftaweyh, فِى الحَجَرِ, i. e., Teaching in infancy<br>\
is like engraving writing upon stone]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
He struck [or fillipped] a man&#39;s head, and in like<br>\
manner a lute, and a tambourine, with his finger.<br>\
(TA.) You say also أُذُنَهُ ↓ أَنْقَرَ, meaning, He<br>\
struck [or fillipped] his ear with his finger. (AA,<br>\
in TA, art. نطب.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence,] نَقَرَ, [aor.<br>\
نَقُرَ, inf.<br>\
n. نَقْرٌ, as appears from what follows;] and ↓ أَنْقَرَ;<br>\
(tropical:)  [He made a snapping with his thumb and middle<br>\
finger;] he struck his thumb against the end of<br>\
the middle finger and made a sound with them.<br>\
(A.) [And in like manner the former verb used<br>\
transitively; as in the following instance:] وَضَعَ<br>\
طَرَفَ إِبْهَامِهِ عَلَى بَاطِنِ سَبَّابَتِهِ ثُمَّ نَقَرَهَا [(tropical:)  He put<br>\
the end of his thumb against the inner side of his<br>\
first finger, then made a snapping with it]. (TA.)<br>\
See also نَقْرٌ, below. ―<br>\
-b8-  [Hence also,] نَقَرَ بِالدَّابَّةِ,<br>\
(T, A, TS,) or بِالفَرَسِ, (S,) aor.<br>\
نَقُرَ, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
نَقْرٌ; (T, S, TS;) and ↓ أَنْقَرَ, (A, TS,) inf. n. إِنْقَارٌ;<br>\
(TS;) (tropical:)  He made a [smacking or] slight sound, to<br>\
put in motion the [beast or] horse, by making his<br>\
tongue adhere to his palate and then opening [or<br>\
suddenly drawing it away]: (S:) or he struck<br>\
with his tongue the place of utterance of the letter<br>\
ن and made a [smacking] sound [by suddenly<br>\
withdrawing his tongue]: (A:) نَقْرٌ signifies the<br>\
making the end of the tongue to adhere to the<br>\
palate, then making a sound [by suddenly withdrawing it]: (M, K:) or one&#39;s putting his tongue<br>\
above his central incisors, at the part next the<br>\
palate, then making a smacking sound [so I<br>\
render ثُمَّ يَنْقُر]: (TA:) [the sounds thus described,<br>\
which are nearly the same, are commonly made<br>\
by the Arabs in the present day, in urging beasts<br>\
of carriage:] or an agitation of the tongue (K,<br>\
TA) in the mouth, upwards and downwards:<br>\
(TA:) or a sound, (so in some copies of the K<br>\
and in the TA,) or slight sound, (so in the TS [as<br>\
mentioned in the TA] and in some copies of the<br>\
K) by which a horse is put in motion: (TS, K:)<br>\
or نَقَرَ بِلِسَانِهِ, accord. to IKtt, signifies he struck<br>\
his palate with his tongue to quiet the horse: but<br>\
this is at variance with what is said by Az, J, and<br>\
ISd, and requires consideration. (TA.) A poet,<br>\
(S,) Fedekee El-Minkaree, (K,) i. e., &#39;Obeyd<br>\
Ibn-Máweeyeh, of the tribe of Teiyi, (TA,) uses<br>\
النَّقُرْ for النَّقْرْ, meaning النَّقْرُ بِالْخَيْلِ [The smacking<br>\
with the tongue to urge the horses]: pausing after<br>\
the word, at the end of a hemistich, he transfers<br>\
the vowel of the ر to the ق, (S, K,) agreeably<br>\
with the dial. of certain of the Arabs, (TA,) that<br>\
the hearer may know it to be the vowel of the<br>\
[final] letter when there is no pause; (S;) like<br>\
as you say, هٰذَا بَكْرُ and مَرَرْتُ بِبَكِرْ: but this is<br>\
not done when the word is in the accus. case<br>\
(S, K:) and if you choose, you may make the<br>\
final letter quiescent in pausing, though it is preceded by a quiescent letter. (S.) ―<br>\
-b9-  Hence also,<br>\
فَإِذَا نُقِرَ فِى النَّاقُورِ [Kur, lxxiv. 8,] (tropical:)  For when the<br>\
horn shall be blown: (S, * A, * Bd, K:) from نَقْرٌ<br>\
signifying (tropical:)  the making a sound: originally,<br>\
striking, which is the cause of sound. (Bd.)<br>\
See also نَاقُورٌ, below. ―<br>\
-b10-  Also, نَقَرَ He bored,<br>\
perforated, or made a hole through or in or into,<br>\
a thing: (TA:) or he did so with a مِنْقَار: (S:)<br>\
and, inf. n. نَقْرٌ, he hollowed out, or excavated, a<br>\
piece of wood. (Mgh, Msb.) نُقِرٌ and ↓ اِنْتَقَرَ,<br>\
(so in some copies of the K,) or ↓ أُنْتُقِرَ, (so in<br>\
other copies of the K and in the TA,) both in the<br>\
pass. form, (TA,) said of stone and of wood and<br>\
the like, signify alike, (K,) It was bored, or perforated, or it had a hole made through or in or<br>\
into it: (TA:) [and it was hollowed out.] You<br>\
say, نَقَرَ البَيْضَةَ عَنِ الفَرْخِ, (K,) aor.<br>\
نَقُرَ, inf. n. نَقْرٌ,<br>\
(TA.) He made a hole in the egg [so as to disclose<br>\
the young bird]. (K.) And نَقَرَت الخَيْلُ,<br>\
(A,) and بحوافرها نُقَرًا ↓ انتقرت, (Lth, K,) The<br>\
horses made hollows in the ground with their hoofs.<br>\
(Lth, A, K.) And in like manner, ↓ انتقرت<br>\
السُّيُولُ نُقَرًا The torrents left hollows in the ground,<br>\
in which water was retained. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  Hence,<br>\
نَقَرَ عَنِ الأَمْرِ; (Msb;) and عَنْهُ ↓ نقّر, (S, K,)<br>\
inf. n. تَنْقِيرٌ; (S;) and ↓ نقّرهُ; and ↓ تنقّرهُ: and<br>\
↓ انتقرهُ; (K;) (tropical:)  He searched or inquired into the<br>\
thing; investigated, scrutinized, or examined, it;<br>\
(S, Msb, K, TA;) and endeavoured to know it:<br>\
(TA;) and so نَقَرَ عَنِ لخَبَرِ (tropical:)  he investigated the<br>\
news, and endeavoured to know it. (A.) [And<br>\
hence,] السَّهْمَ بَيْنَ إِصْبَعَيْهِ ↓ نقّر. (K, in art. حن,)<br>\
or عَلَى الإِبْهَامِ, inf. n. تَنْقِيرٌ, (K, in art. دوم,) [He<br>\
tried the sonorific quality of the arrow by turning<br>\
it round between his fingers, or upon his thumb:<br>\
see حَنَّانٌ, and دَرَّ السَّهْمُ, and see also 4, in art. دوم:<br>\
or] نقّر السَّهْمَ signifies he made the arrow to produce a sharp sound [by turning it round between<br>\
his fingers, or] upon his thumb. (TK, in art. دوم.)<br>\
2<br>\
نَقَّرَ see 1, last two sentences.<br>\
4<br>\
أَنْقَرَ see 1, in three places, in the first half.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
انقر عَنْهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. إِنْفَارٌ, (TA,) He refrained,<br>\
forbore, abstained, or desisted, from it or him;<br>\
he left or relinquished, it or him. (S, * K.) Hence<br>\
the saying, ضَرَبَهُ فَمَا أَنْقَرَ عَنْهُ حَتَّى قَتَلَهُ He beat<br>\
him and left him not until be killed him. (TA.)<br>\
And hence the saying of I&#39;Ab, مَاكَانَ اللّٰهُ لِيُنْقِرَ<br>\
عَنْ قَاتِلِ الْمُؤْمِنِ, i. e., God will not leave the<br>\
slayer of the believer until He destroy him (S,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَنَقَّرَ see 1, last signification<br>\
8<br>\
إِنْتَقَرَ see 1, latter part, in four places.<br>\
نَقْرٌ (tropical:)  A slight sound that is heard in consequence<br>\
of striking the thumb against the middle finger<br>\
[and then letting them fly apart in opposite<br>\
directions, passing each other]: (S, K:) [or the<br>\
snapping with the fingers or with the thumb and<br>\
middle finger, or with the thumb and first finger;<br>\
as also ↓ نَقيرٌ: n. an. of the former with ة.] One<br>\
says, مَا أَثَابَهُ نَقْرَةٌ (tropical:)  [He did not reward him with<br>\
even a snap of the fingers;] meaning, with anything: (S, K [in the former of which it is implied<br>\
that نقرة thus used is from نَقْرٌ in the first of the<br>\
senses explained above;]) not used thus save in<br>\
[a negative phrase. (S.) A poet says,<br>\
وَهُنّ حَرَى أَلَّا يُثِبْنَكَ نقْرَةٌ<br>\
وَأَنْتَ حَرُى بِالنَّار حِينَ تُثِيبُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [And they are fit, or worthy, not to reward thee<br>\
with anything, and thou art fit for, or worthy<br>\
of, the fire of hell when thou rewardest]. (S.)<br>\
Or the right reading in both these instances is<br>\
↓ نُقْرَةً, with damm. (TA.) [See نُقْرَةٌ.] One<br>\
says also, لَمْ يَكْتَرِتْ لِى بِقَدُر نَقْرَة إِصْبَعٍ (tropical:)  [He<br>\
did not care for me so much as a snap of a<br>\
finger]. (A.) [See also an (??) in a verse cited<br>\
in the first paragraph of art. شأو.] I&#39;Ab, in<br>\
explanation of the words of the Kur, [iv. 123,]<br>\
وَلَا يُظْلَمُونَ نَقِيرًا, put the end of the thumb<br>\
against the inner side of his first finger, then<br>\
made a snapping with it (ثُمَّ نَقَرَهَا), and said,<br>\
This is what is termed ↓ نَقِيرٌ; [denoting the lit.<br>\
meaning to be (tropical:)  And they shall not be wronged a<br>\
snap of the fingers.] (TA.) But see نُقْرَةٌ,<br>\
below. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, A sound, or slight sound, by<br>\
which a horse is put in motion: (TS, K:) as<br>\
also ↓ نَقِيرٌ: (TA:) or the former has one or<br>\
other of the different significations assigned to it<br>\
above, in the explanations under the head of<br>\
نَقَرَ بِالدَّابَّةِ. (K, &amp;c.)<br>\
نِقْرٌ: see نُقْرَةٌ.<br>\
نَقْرَةٌ: see نَقْرٌ, in four places.<br>\
نُقْرَةٌ A small hollow or cavity in the ground:<br>\
(S:) or a hollow or cavity in the ground, not<br>\
large: (Msb:) or a hollow or cavity in the<br>\
ground in which water stagnates: (TA:) or<br>\
a round وَهْدَة [or hollow] in the ground, (K, TA,)<br>\
not large, in which water stagnates: (TA:)<br>\
pl. نُقَرٌ (A, K) and نِقَارٌ: (K:) ↓ نَقِيرٌ also signifies a hollow, or cavity, in the ground; and its<br>\
pl. is أَنْقِرَةٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (S.) The place<br>\
where the قَمَحْدُوَة [or occiput] ends, in the back<br>\
part of the neck; (K;) i. e., the hollow in the<br>\
back of the neck; (TA;) what is called نُقْرَةُ<br>\
القَفَا; (S, A, Msb;) i. e., the hollow where (??)<br>\
brain ends: the cupping in that part occasions<br>\
forgetfulness: (Msb.) [and any similar hollow<br>\
as the pit of the stomach: and a dimple:<br>\
accord. to present usage; and in this sense it is<br>\
used in the A, K, and TA, voce فَحْصَةٌ ―<br>\
-b3-  The<br>\
cavity, or socket, of the eye. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Foramen<br>\
and; syn. ثَقْبُ الاِسْتِ: (K:) but in the (??)<br>\

perforation, that is the middle of the haunch;<br>\
[app. meaning the sacro-ischiatic foramen: see<br>\
الفَائِلُ, in art. فيل: but perhaps it may sometimes<br>\
mean the socket of the thigh-bone; for نُقْرةٌ<br>\
signifies any socket of a bone.] (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  The<br>\
little spot [or embryo] upon the back of a date<br>\
stone, (AHeyth, K,) which is as though it were<br>\

Msb, K) and ↓ نِقْرٌ (K) and ↓ أُنْقُورٌ. (Sgh, K)<br>\
You say, مَا أَثَابَهُ نُقْرَةٌ, (El-Basáir, TA,) and<br>\
↓ نَقِيرًا, (A,) lit., [He did not reward hour] (??)<br>\
even a little spot on the back of a date-stone;<br>\
(A, El-Basáïr;) meaning, (tropical:)  with the meanest<br>\
thing. (El Basáïr.) In the S and K, ما اثابه<br>\
نَقْرَةٌ: see نَقْرٌ.] And مَا أَعْنَى عَنِّى نُقْرَةٌ (tropical:)  He<br>\
did not stand me in stead of the meanest (??)<br>\

a little spot on the back of a date-stone; meaning,<br>\
لَبْسُوا بَعْدَكَ فِى شَىْءٍ (tropical:)  [after thee they are not<br>\
worth anything]. (S.) And hence, accord. to<br>\
ISk [and the Jel], the saying in the Kur,<br>\
[iv. 123.] وَلَا يُظْلَمُونَ نَقِيرًا [And they shall not<br>\
be wronged even as to a little spot on the back of<br>\
a date-stone.] (TA.) Hence also, [in verse 56<br>\
of the same chap.,] لَا يُؤْتُونَ النَّاسَ نَقِيرًا (tropical:)  They<br>\
would not give men a thing as inconsiderable as<br>\
the little hollow in the back of a date-stone.<br>\
(Jel.) See also نَقْرٌ. ―<br>\

or the lower part, (أَصْل,) of a palm-tree, (T,)<br>\
which is hollowed out, and in which the beverage<br>\
called نَبِيذ is made; (T, S, Msb, K;) the نبيذ<br>\
whereof becomes strong: (S, K:) or a stump, or<br>\
the lower part, (اصل,) of a palm-tree, which it<br>\
was a custom of the people of El-Yemámeh to<br>\
hollow out, then they crushed in it ripe dates and<br>\
unripe dates, which [with water poured upon<br>\
them] they left until fermentation had taken place<br>\
therein and subsided: (A &#39;Obeyd:) or a stump,<br>\
or the lower part, (اصل,) of a palm-tree, whereof<br>\
the middle was hollowed out, then dates were put<br>\
in them, with water, which became intoxicating<br>\
نبيذ: (IAth:) the word is of the measure فَعِيلٌ<br>\
in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ. (Msb.) It<br>\
is said in a trad., that Mohammad forbade<br>\
النَّقِير, (S, * Msb, * TA,) meaning, the نبيذ thereof.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A trunk of a palm-tree, hollowed out,<br>\
and having the like of steps made in it, by which<br>\
one ascends to غُرف [or upper chambers]. (K.<br>\

-b4-  See also نُقْرَةٌ, throughout.<br>\
نُقَارَةٌ The quantity [of grain] which a bird<br>\
pecks, or picks up. (K.) See 8, in art. قب. ―<br>\

who bores (يَنْقُرُ) mill-stones. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  One<br>\

hits, (Msb,) or has hit, (S, A, K,) the butt, (S,<br>\

hit the butt it is not so called: (S, TA:) [but<br>\
see a phrase following:] pl. نَوَاقِرُ. (A, Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] أَخْطَأَتْ نَوَاقِرُهُ (tropical:)  [lit., His arrows<br>\
that were wont to hit the butt missed]; meaning,<br>\
he did not continue in the right course. (TA.)<br>\
[And hence,] نَاقِرَةٌ (tropical:)  A calamity; (K, TA;)<br>\

-b4-  Also, نَاقِرَةٌ (tropical:)  A<br>\

syn. حُجَّةٌ مُصِيبَةٌ: in the K, a و is incorrectly<br>\
inserted between these two words: but the pl.,<br>\
نَوَاقِرُ, is afterwards correctly rendered in the K.<br>\
(TA.) One says, أَتَتْنِى عَنْهُ نَوَاقِرُ (tropical:)  There came<br>\
to me, from him, speech which displeased me, or<br>\
grieved me: or right arguments, or the like, (K,<br>\
TA,) like arrows hitting the mark. (TA.) In the<br>\

bird as the mouth to a man; (Msb;) because it<br>\
pecks, or picks up, with it: (TA:) or of a bird<br>\
which is not one of prey; that of a bird of prey<br>\
being called مِنْسَرٌ: (Fs, and S in art. نسر,<br>\

bird; used in this sense in the TA, art. صغو:]<br>\
pl. مَنَاقِيرُ. (S.) ―<br>\

(TA.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says,<br>\
كَأَرْحَآءِ رَقْدٍ زَلَّمَتْهَا المَنَاقِرُ<br>\
[Like mill-stones of Rakd (a mountain so called)<br>\
which the minkars have rounded]. (TA.) See<br>\
