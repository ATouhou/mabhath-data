نَضَبَ, aor.<br>\
نَضُبَ (S, K, &amp;c.) and also<br>\
نَضِبَ, (Msb,)<br>\
which latter is strange, (MF,) inf. n. نُضُوبٌ;<br>\
(S, K, &amp;c.;) and ↓ نضّب; (K;) It (water) sank<br>\
into the earth; disappeared in the earth: (S,<br>\
M, K, &amp;c.:) and became low: (S:) became<br>\
remote. (S, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَضَبَ الحَوْضُ, occurring in<br>\
a verse cited by Th, [The water of the tank or<br>\
cistern, sank into the earth]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  نَضَبَتْ<br>\
عُيُونُ الطَّائِفِ [The sources of El-Táïf became<br>\
dried up]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  مَا نَضَبَ عَنْهُ البَحْرُ وَهُوَ حَىٌّ<br>\
فَمَاتَ فَكُلُوهُ That from which the water of the<br>\
sea has become exhausted, and has dried up, it<br>\
being alive, and which has then died, eat ye it.<br>\
(TA, from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b5-  كُنَّا عَلَى شَاطِئِ النَّهْرِ بِالْأَهْوَازِ<br>\
وَقَدْ نَضَبَ عَنْهُ المَاءُ [We were on the bank of the<br>\
river in El-Ahwáz, and the water had sunk, or<br>\
receded, from it, leaving it dry]. (TA, from a<br>\
trad.) ―<br>\
-b6-  نَضَبَتْ عَيْنُهُ, (aor.<br>\
نَضُبَ, inf. n. نُضُوبٌ,<br>\
TA,) (tropical:)  His eye sank, or became depressed, in the<br>\
socket: or it is only said of the eye of a she-camel. (K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  نَضَبَ It (herbage and the like,<br>\
that had been abundant,) became little, or scanty:<br>\
(K:) or failed altogether. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  نَضَبَ is<br>\
met. used with reference to accidents [as it is<br>\
properly with respect to substances]: thus it is<br>\
said in a trad., نَضَبَ عُمْرُهُ (tropical:)  His life passed<br>\
away, or ended. (IAth.) This is what F means<br>\
by saying نَضَبَ فُلَانٌ signifies مَاتَ, (tropical:)  Such a one<br>\
died. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  نَضَبَ خَيْرُهُ, inf. n. نُضُوبٌ, (tropical:)  His<br>\
goodness, or beneficence, became little. (AZ.) ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
نَضَبَ مَاءُ وَجْهِهِ (tropical:)  He was not ashamed. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
نَضَبَ, (inf. n. نُضُوبٌ, TA,) (tropical:)  It (a desert) was<br>\
far-extending. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَضَبَ, inf. n. نُضُوبٌ, (tropical:)  It<br>\
(a people, or party,) was, or became, distant.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  نَضَبَ (tropical:)  It (a people, or party,) strove,<br>\
or used exertion, [app., in a journey.] (TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
نَضَبَ, aor.<br>\
نَضُبَ, It (a thing, TA,) flowed, and ran<br>\
(K.) By our saying “ a thing,” we mean to<br>\
exclude water, though water is included in the<br>\
definition of a thing: so that we need not infer<br>\
from what is said in the K that the verb bears<br>\
two contr. significations. (TA.) [But this observation appears to me to be scarcely admissible.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  نَضَبَتِ الدَّبَرَةُ [in the copies of the K in my<br>\
hands, written دَبْرَة] The sore on the back of a<br>\
camel &amp;c. became severe. (K.) نَضَبَ الدَّبَرُ (tropical:)  The<br>\
scar of the sore became severe and deep in the<br>\
back. (A.)<br>\
-A4-  نَضَبَ الثَّوْبَ He pulled off the<br>\
garment. (Msb.)<br>\
2<br>\
نَضَّبَ see 1 ―<br>\
-b2-  نضّبت, inf. n. تَنْضِيبٌ, She (a camel)<br>\
had little milk; and her flow thereof became slow;<br>\
(K;) and her milk was long in flowing again into<br>\
her udder after each previous milking. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
انضب القَوْسَ He pulled the string of the bow,<br>\
in order that it might make a sound: like أَنْبَضَهَا:<br>\
(K:) the former verb is [said to be] an original<br>\
syn. of the latter; (TA;) [and if so, it has<br>\
an inf. n., as shown below:] or he pulled<br>\
the string of the bow, and then let it go, to<br>\
make it twang: or he pulled the string of<br>\
the bow without an arrow, and then let it go,<br>\
to make it twang: (TA:) or he caused the bow<br>\
to make a sound, or twang: (AHn, L:) انضب<br>\
وَتَرَ القَوْسِ is the same as أَنْبَضَهُ, of which it is<br>\
a transp. syn. (S.) AHn, gives to it the inf. n.<br>\
إِنْضَابٌ; and yet asserts it to be formed by transposition: but this is absurd; for verbs so formed<br>\
have not inf. ns.; as mentioned by Sb and Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Alee and the rest of the skilful grammarians.<br>\
(Abu-l-Hasan.) See قَلَبَ.<br>\
غَضِيرٌ نَاضِبٌ A pool of which the water has sunk<br>\
into the earth. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [So] ↓ عين مُنَضِّبَةٌ A source<br>\
of which the water has sunk into the earth; [a<br>\
source that has become dried up]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  خَرْقٌ<br>\
نَاضبٌ (tropical:)  [A deep hole: or a far extending desert]:<br>\
syn. بَعِيدٌ. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  إِنَّ فُلَانًا لَنَاضِبُ الخَيْرِ<br>\
(tropical:)  Verily such a one is a person of little good, or<br>\
beneficence. (AZ.) ―<br>\
-b5-  نَاضِبٌ (tropical:)  Distant; remote:<br>\
(As, S:) an epithet applied to water and anything. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  جَرْىٌ نَاضِبٌ (assumed tropical:)  A far-extending run. (TA.)<br>\
تَنْضُبٌ, a coll. gen. n., [I find it said to have<br>\
been written with tenween by J himself: but it<br>\
appears to have been also used as a generic<br>\
proper name; and as such, having the measure<br>\
of a verb, it must be written تَنْضُبُ, being<br>\
imperfectly declinable:] A certain tree: the<br>\
ت is augmentative, because there is no word of<br>\
the measure فَعْلُلٌ; whereas there are words of<br>\
the measure تَفْعُلُ, as تَقْتُلُ and تَخْرُجُ:<br>\
n. un. تَنْضُبَةٌ: (S:) a certain tree of El-Hijáz:<br>\
(K:) it grows large, in the form, or manner, of<br>\
the سَرْح, having white and thick branches; and<br>\
folds, such as are called حَظَائِر, are made of it:<br>\
[this is the only meaning I can assign to the<br>\
words وهو محتظر, supposing بِهِ to be omitted<br>\
after محنظر, though يُحْنَظَرُ would be better:]<br>\
its leaves are contracted; and it always appears<br>\
as though it were dry and dusty, though growing: (TA:) its thorns are like those of the<br>\
عَوْسَج: (K, TA:) and it has a fruit [called مَغْدٌ<br>\
(L, K, art. مغد)] like small grapes, which is<br>\
eaten, of a reddish colour: AHn says, that its<br>\
smoke is white, of the colour of dust; and that<br>\
poets therefore liken dust to it: and in one place<br>\
he says, that it is a large tree, without leaves<br>\
[properly so called], which has a trunk, and<br>\
from which grow thick boughs, with many<br>\
branches; its leaves [if such they may be called]<br>\
being only shoots, which are eaten by the camels<br>\
and sheep and goats: Aboo-Nasr says, that it is<br>\
a tree having short thorns: not of the trees that<br>\
grow on lofty mountains; frequented by chameleons: [see حِرْبَاءٌ, in art. حرب: and see an ex. in<br>\
a verse cited voce سَاقٌ:] ISd thinks that it is<br>\
thus called because of its little sap: AM says,<br>\
that it is a large tree, from which are cut tentpoles: (TA:) and Ibn-Selemeh says, that it is a<br>\
tree from which arrows are made. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نُوقٌ<br>\
كَقِدَاحِ التَّنْضُبِ [She-camels like arrows made<br>\
of the wood of the tendub]. (TA).<br>\
