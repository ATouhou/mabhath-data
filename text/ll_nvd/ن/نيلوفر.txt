CK,) or نَيْلَوْفَرٌ, (so in copies of the K, and so<br>\
accord. to the TA,) or, as some say, نَيْنُوفَرٌ, or<br>\
نَيْنُوْفَرٌ, (accord. to different copies of the K,)<br>\
[The nymphæa, or lotus of Egypt and of Syria;]<br>\
a certain well-known plant; (Msb;) a kind of<br>\
sweet-smelling plant, which grows in stagnant<br>\
waters, (K, TA,) called by the people of Egypt<br>\
بشنين, [i. e. بَشْنِين,] and by the vulgar نَوْفَر;<br>\
(TA;) [both of which last names are now given<br>\
in Egypt to the nymphæa lotus, or white lotus,<br>\
found in the neighbourhoods of Rosetta and<br>\
Damietta; and the former, also, or perhaps both,<br>\
to the nymphæa cærulea, or blue lotus, found in<br>\
the same parts, and, until within a few years, in<br>\
a lake on the north of Cairo, called Birket erRatlee, whence I have twice procure roots of<br>\
this plant:] نيلوفر [written in Persian نِيلْپَرْ and<br>\
نِيلُوپَرْ and نِيلُوبَرْكْ &amp;c.] is a Persian word<br>\
(أَعْجَمِيَّةٌ), and is said to be composed of نِيل, [or<br>\
indigo,] with which one dyes, and the name for<br>\
a wing, [i. e., پَرْ;] as though “ winged with نِيل<br>\
[or indigo]; ” because the leaf is as though its<br>\
two wings were dyed [with indigo]: (Msb:) the<br>\
plant so called is cold in the third degree, moist<br>\
in the second degree, emollient, good for cough<br>\
and for pains of the side and lungs and chest;<br>\
when its root, or lower part, (أَصْل,) is kneaded<br>\
with water, and used as a liniment, several times,<br>\
it removes the disease called البَهَق; and when<br>\
kneaded with زِفْت, it removes the disease called<br>\
دَآءُ الثَّعْلَبِ: (K, TA:) an excellent beverage is<br>\
also prepared from it. (TA.) The imám Bedred-Deen Mudhaffar, son of the Kádee of Baalabekk, says, in his book entitled Suroor en-Nefs,<br>\
that it is of many species; whereof [one or more]<br>\
in Syria, used in perfume; and a species in Egypt,<br>\
blue; and that its temperament is cold and moist<br>\
in the second degree; that the smelling it is useful<br>\
against hot diseases, and anxiety; and its juice<br>\
in like manner; and that the beverage prepared<br>\
from it is useful as a remedy for cough and<br>\
roughness [of the throat] and pain of the side<br>\
and chest, and is a laxative. The author of the<br>\
Irshád and that of the Moojiz also mention, that<br>\
the beverage prepared from it is an exception<br>\
from other sweet beverages inasmuch as it does<br>\
not become converted into yellow bile, which is<br>\
wonderful; and its oil is more cold and moist<br>\
than that of violets; and there is no flower more<br>\
cold and moist than it. Er-Rázee, too, says that<br>\
the smelling it is one of the causes of weakening<br>\
the generative faculty, and that the beverage is<br>\
one of the causes of stopping it; [for which purpose, or as an antiaphrodisiac, it is used in the<br>\
present day by some of the women of Cairo;]<br>\
notwithstanding which, it rejoices the heart, and<br>\
is useful for palpitation of the heart. This art. is<br>\
omitted by J and Sgh and the author of the L.<br>\
