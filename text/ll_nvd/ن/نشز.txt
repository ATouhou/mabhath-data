نَشَزٌ, aor.<br>\
نَشُزَ and<br>\
نَشِزَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. نَشْزٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) or نُشُوزٌ, (Msb,) He rose, or raised himself, (S, A, Msb, K,) فِى المَكَانِ in the place, (S,)<br>\
and فِى مَجْلِسِهِ in his sitting-place, (TA,) and<br>\
عَنْ مَكَانِهِ, (A,) or مِنْ مَكَانِهِ, (Msb,) from his<br>\
place: (A, Msb:) or he rose a little in his sittingplace: (TA:) or he stood up after sitting. (TA.)<br>\
Both forms of the aor. occur, accord. to different<br>\
readings, (the former being the reading of the<br>\
people of El-Hijáz, and the latter that of others,<br>\
Fr, TA,) in the Kur, [lviii. 12,] وَإِذَا قِيلَ انْشُِزُوا<br>\
فَانْشُِزُوا, (Msb, TA,) meaning, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, And when it is said, Rise ye and stand<br>\
up, then do ye rise and stand up. (TA.) Accord.<br>\
to IKtt, نَشَزَ القَوْمُ فِى مَجْلِسِهِمْ signifies The people<br>\
drew themselves together [in their sitting-place to<br>\
make room] for those sitting with them: and also<br>\
they rose from their sitting-place, and stood up.<br>\
(TA.) You say also, نَشَزَ بِالقَوْمِ فِى الخُصُومَةِ,<br>\
inf. n. نُشُوزٌ, He rose with the people for the<br>\
purpose of contention, altercation, or litigation.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He, or it, overtopped, or overlooked, an<br>\
elevated piece of ground, and appeared. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [It rose; rose from its place; was, or became,<br>\
high or elevated, protuberant or prominent; it<br>\
protruded.] ―<br>\
-b4-  نَشَزَتْ نَفْسُهُ (tropical:)  His soul, or spirit,<br>\
or stomach, heaved, (A, K,) by reason of fright.<br>\
(A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Hence, from نَشَزَ in the first of the<br>\
senses explained above, (Msb,) or from نَشْزٌ, signifying “ high, or elevated, ground,” (Aboo-Is-<br>\
hák, TA,) نَشَزَتِ المَرْأَةُ, (S, K,) or نَشَزَتْ عَلَى زَوْجِهَا,<br>\
(A, Mgh, TA,) or مِنْ زَوْجِهَا, (Msb,) and بِزَوْجِهَا,<br>\

K,) and deserted him: (TA:) or she disliked him,<br>\
or hated him, (Zj, Mgh, TA,) and was an evil<br>\

raised the bones of the dead to their places, and<br>\
set them, or put them together, one upon another.<br>\

the bones (of thine ass), how we raise them to their<br>\
places, &amp;c., then we clothe them with flesh], accord.<br>\
to the reading of Zeyd Ibn-Thábit; (Fr, S, * TA;)<br>\
but the Koofees read [نُنْشِرُهَا] with rá: the<br>\

-b3-  Hence also,<br>\

increased, or augmented, the bone: as also انشرهُ,<br>\
