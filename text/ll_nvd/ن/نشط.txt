نَشِطَ, inf. n. نَشْطٌ,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) He went forth from a place: (K:)<br>\
he passed, or crossed, from one country or the like<br>\
to another: (TA:) said, for instance, of a wild<br>\
bull: (AO, IDrd, S, K:) and in like manner, a<br>\
star, [meaning a planet,] from one sign of the<br>\

aor.<br>\
نَشِطَ, inf. n. نَشْطٌ, The camels went, either in a<br>\

الهُمُومُ تَنْشِطُ بِصَاحِبِهَا (S, TA) (assumed tropical:)  Griefs, or disquietudes of mind, lead forth him who has them<br>\
[from place to place]. (TA.) Himyán Ibn-<br>\
Koháfeh says,<br>\
أَمْسَتَ هُمُومِى تَنْشِطُ المَنَاشِطَا<br>\
أَلشَّأْمَ بِى طَوْرًا وَطَوْرًا وَاسِطَا<br>\

نَشُطَ, (TA,) [inf. n. نَشْطٌ,] He pulled<br>\
out the bucket, (S, K,) or pulled it up, (TA,)<br>\
from the well, (S, TA,) without a pulley. (S,<br>\

-b2-  And hence, المَلَائِكَةُ تَنْشِطُ الأَرْوَاحَ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
angels draw forth the souls like as the bucket is<br>\
drawn forth from the well: (Zj:) and تَنْشِطُ نَفْسَ<br>\

which means, (K,) accord. to Ibn-&#39;Aráfeh, (TA,)<br>\

↓ نشَّطهُ, (K,) inf. n. تَنْشِيطٌ: (TA:) or he tied it<br>\
in a knot such as is termed أُنْشُوطَة; (AZ, S, Msb;)<br>\
as also ↓ the latter verb: (Ham, p. 742:) and<br>\
نَشَطَ العُقْدَةَ he tied the knot so as to form what is<br>\
thus termed: (Mgh:) and نَشَطَ الأُنْشُوطَةَ he tied<br>\

-A2-  See<br>\
also 1, last sentence but one, in two places; and<br>\

company of men, (S,) His, or their, beasts, (S,<br>\
K,) or family, (K,) were, or became, in a state<br>\

-A2-  As a trans. v.:<br>\
see 2. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] It (herbage) rendered a<br>\

-A3-  He loosed, untied, or<br>\
undid, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) a cord, or rope, (S,<br>\
K,) or a knot such as is termed أُنْشُوطَة; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) as also ↓ انتشط; and ↓ نَشَطَ; (Mgh;) and<br>\
in like manner, the bond termed عِقَال; (Msb;)<br>\
and so, perhaps, ↓ نشّط: (Ham, p. 165:) he<br>\
pulled a cord, or rope, until, or so that, it became<br>\
loosed, untied, or undone; (TA;) as also ↓ انتشط:<br>\
(S, K, TA,) he caused the عِقَال to become loosed,<br>\
untied, or undone, by pulling its انشوطة: (K, *<br>\
TA:) he loosed, untied, or undid, a knot by a<br>\
single pull. (TA.) You say also, انشط البَعِيرَ He<br>\

of the camel. (TA.) And انشط البَعِيرَ مِنْ عِقَالِهِ<br>\
He loosed the camel from his عِقَال. (Msb.)<br>\
[And hence the saying,] كَأَنَّمَا أُنْشِطَ مِنْ عِقَالٍ As<br>\
though he were loosed [from a bond such as is<br>\
called عِقَال]: (S, * Mgh, TA:) a proverb, relating<br>\
to an event&#39;s happening quickly; (Mgh;) or<br>\
said of him who commences any work quickly;<br>\
and of the sick when he recovers; and of a person<br>\
who has swooned when he revives; and of a<br>\
person sent to execute an affair, hastening his<br>\
determination respecting it: (TA:) it is often<br>\
related in a different manner, كانّما نُشِطَ من عقال;<br>\
but this is not correct. (IAth, TA.) [But see<br>\
above, in this paragraph; and see 1, where a<br>\
similar meaning is assigned to the unaugmented<br>\
verb.]<br>\
-A4-  He bound, or tied, him, or it, firmly,<br>\
fastly, or strongly: so in the copies of the K; so<br>\
that, if this be correct, the verb has two contr.<br>\
significations. (TA.)<br>\
-A5-  See also 8.<br>\

And تنشّطت الأَرْضَ (assumed tropical:)  She (a camel) traversed, or<br>\
crossed, the land, like the نَاشِط in her quickness, or<br>\
her aim, with briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
انتشط It (a cord, or rope,) became loosed,<br>\
untied, or undone. (Har, p. 361.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  He (a<br>\
man) became loosed from the tie of silence, (Har,<br>\
p. 360.; Mgh,) and from that of impotence. (Mgh<br>\
[in which a doubt is expressed as to its being of<br>\
classical authority].)<br>\
-A2-  As a trans. v.: see 4, in<br>\
two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  He pulled, or drew, a thing. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  He seized a thing, took it hastily, or snatched<br>\

المَرْعَى, (Sh, K,) and الكَلَأَ, (Sh,) The camels, or<br>\
sheep or goats, pulled up, or out, the herbage, with<br>\
the teeth. (Sh, K.) ―<br>\

cords, or ropes, in the time of undoing them for the<br>\
purpose of their being twisted or plaited a second<br>\
time. (IAar, K.)<br>\
نَشْطَةٌ as used in the following saying, (Mgh,)<br>\
الشُّفْعَةُ كَنَشْطَةِ العِقَالِ The right termed شفعة is<br>\
like the loosing of the bond called عقال, in respect<br>\
of the speediness with which it becomes of no<br>\
effect, (Mgh, Msb,) by delay, (Msb,) is of the<br>\
measure فَعْلَةٌ from أَنْشَطَ, or from نَشَطَ in the<br>\
sense of انشط; or the meaning is, like the tying<br>\
of the عقال; i. e., it is of short duration; but the<br>\
former explanation is the more apparently right.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
بِئْرٌ نَشُوطٌ A well from which the bucket does not<br>\
come forth until it is much pulled, (As, S, TA,)<br>\
by reason of the distance of its bottom; (TA;)<br>\

نَشِيطٌ (S, Msb, K) Brisk, lively, sprightly,<br>\
active, agile, prompt, and quick; (Msb;) or<br>\
pleased, cheerful, happy, or willing; to do work<br>\
&amp;c.; as also ↓ نَاشِطٌ; (K;) [see نَشِطَ;] applied<br>\
to a man; (S, TA;) and to a beast of carriage;<br>\
fem. with ة: (TA:) pl. نِشَاطٌ (Har, p. 591) [and<br>\
نَشَاطَى]. ―<br>\
-b2-  A man (TA) whose family, or beasts,<br>\
are in a state of نَشَاط [i. e. briskness, liveliness,<br>\
sprightliness, &amp;c.: see 1]; as also ↓ مُنْشِطٌ. (K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
نَاشِطٌ: see نَشِيطٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  In a verse of Et-Tirimmáh,<br>\
[see استطرب,] نَاشِطًا is used for شَوْقًا نَازِعًا [By<br>\
reason of yearning, or longing, desire]. (K, in<br>\
art. دد.)<br>\
-A2-  A wild bull going forth from land to<br>\
land, (S, K,) or from country to country. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (S,) النَّاشِطَاتُ, as used in the Kur,<br>\
lxxix. 2, meaning The stars [or planets] going<br>\
forth from one sign of the zodiac to another: (S,<br>\
K:) or it means the stars that rise, then set:<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, TA:) or the angels that draw forth<br>\
the souls like as the bucket is drawn forth from<br>\
the well: (Zj, TA:) or the angels that loose the<br>\
soul of the believer gently: (Fr, * Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, K:)<br>\
or the believing souls that are brisk, lively, sprightly,<br>\
or active, at death: (K, * TA:) or, as some say,<br>\
[too fancifully,] the angels that ratify events;<br>\
from نَشَطَ العُقْدَةَ, q. v.; and as this signifies the<br>\
tying of a knot which is easily undone, the thing&#39;s<br>\
easiness to them is thus notified. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  A<br>\
road going forth from the main road, to the right,<br>\
and to the left: (Lth, K *:) pl. نَوَاشِطُ: (TA:)<br>\
which latter word is applied in like manner to<br>\
water-courses (K, TA) going forth from the main<br>\
water-course to the right and left. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
See also نُشُطٌ.<br>\
بِئْرٌ أَنْشَاطٌ, (K, and so in a copy of the S, as on<br>\
the authority of As, but in another copy of the<br>\
S the ا is without any vowel,) and بِئْرٌ إِنْشَاطٌ, (K,<br>\
and, accord. to the TA, on the authority of As,<br>\
and mentioned by IB on the authority of<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd,) A well of little depth, from which the<br>\
bucket comes forth by means of a single pull: (As,<br>\
S, K:) the latter may be defended on the ground<br>\
of considering إِنْشَاطٌ as originally an inf. n., of<br>\
أَنْشَطَ signifying “ he loosed, untied, or undid,” a<br>\
knot “ by a single pull. ” (TA.)<br>\
أُنْشُوطَةٌ [A knot tied with a bow, or with a<br>\
double bow, so as to form a kind of slip-knot;<br>\
whence, in modern vulgar Arabic, عُقْدَة وَشُنَيْطَة,<br>\
applied to such a tie; and شُنَيْطَة, applied to a<br>\
simple slip-knot;] a knot, or tie, which easily<br>\
becomes undone, or untied, like that of the running<br>\
band of a pair of drawers; (S, Mgh, K;) a knot,<br>\
or tie, which becomes undone when one of its two<br>\
ends is pulled. (Msb, TA.) You say, مَا عِقَالُكَ<br>\
بِأُنْسُوطَةٍ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Thy love, or affection, is not<br>\
weak, or frail. (S.)<br>\
مَنْشَطٌ A thing on account of which, or to do<br>\
which, one is brisk, lively, sprightly, or active; or<br>\
pleased, cheerful, or happy; and which one likes,<br>\
or prefers, to do: opposed to مَكْرَهٌ. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
مَنْشِطٌ A place to which one goes forth: pl.<br>\
مَنَاشِطُ. See an ex. of the pl., voce نَشَطَ.]<br>\
