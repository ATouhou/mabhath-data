نَقَصَ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
نَقُصَ, (M,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. نُقْصَانٌ (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K)<br>\
and نَقْصٌ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) or the former of<br>\
these two only, the latter being the inf. n. of the<br>\
trans. verb, (MS,) and نَقِيصَةٌ (M) and تَنْقَاصٌ,<br>\
(K,) [which last is an intensive form,] said of a<br>\
thing, (S, M,) intrans., (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
It lost somewhat, decreased, diminished, lessened,<br>\
wasted, waned, or became defective or deficient or<br>\
incomplete or imperfect, after having been whole<br>\
or complete or perfect: (IKtt, Msb, TA:) or he,<br>\
or it, lost, or suffered loss or diminution, (A, K,)<br>\
with respect to lot or portion: (K:) and ↓ انتقص<br>\
signifies the same; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) and<br>\
so does ↓ تنقّص; (TK, [probably from the TA,]<br>\
art. أَفن;) and so does ↓ تناقص: (TA:) [or this last<br>\
signifies it lost somewhat, decreased, &amp;c., gradually;<br>\
contr. of تزايد.] It is said in a trad., (Mgh,)<br>\
شَهْرَا عِيدٍ لَا يَنْقُصَانِ, (Mgh, K,) i. e. Ramadán and<br>\
Dhu-l-Hijjeh, (Mgh,) meaning, Two months of<br>\
festival are not defective virtually (فِى الحُكْمِ)<br>\
though they be defective in number [of days];<br>\
(K;) i. e. let no doubt occur in your hearts when<br>\
ye fast nine and twenty days [instead of thirty];<br>\
nor if there happen a mistake respecting the day<br>\
of the pilgrimage, will there be any deficiency in<br>\
your performance of the rites thereof: (TA:) or,<br>\
as some say, two months of festival will not be<br>\
defective in one and the same year; but Et-<br>\
Taháwee disapproves of this explanation: some<br>\
say that the meaning is, that though they be<br>\
defective, or one of them be so, yet their recompense will be complete. (Mgh.) It is also said<br>\
in a trad., إِنَّ العَمَلَ فِى عَشْرِ ذِى الحِجَّةِ لَا يَنْقُصُ<br>\
ثَوَابُهُ عَمَّا فِى شَهْرِ رَمَضَانَ [Verily the deed that is<br>\
done on the tenth of Dhu-l-Hijjeh, the recompense<br>\
thereof will not fall short of that which is in the<br>\
month of Ramadán: for نَقَصَ عَنْ كَذَا means It<br>\
fell short of such a thing.] (Mgh.) [On the expression فِى النُّقْصَانِ, as used in grammar, see غَفِيرٌ.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
نَقَصَهُ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
نَقُصَ, (Msb,) inf.<br>\
n. نَقْصٌ, (MS,) [and accord. to the TK تَنْقَاصٌ<br>\
and نُقْصَانٌ also, which last, however, is said in<br>\
the MS to be an inf. n. of the intrans. verb only,]<br>\
He made it to lose somewhat, decreased it, diminished it, curtailed it, lessened it, wasted it,<br>\
impaired it, took from it, or made it defective or<br>\
deficient or incomplete or imperfect, after it had<br>\
been whole or complete or perfect; (Msb;) he<br>\
made it (i. e. a share, or portion) defective or<br>\
deficient: (K:) [the pronoun often relates to a<br>\
man: see an ex. in art. ضوز, and another in art.<br>\
وكس:] this is the [most] chaste form of the<br>\
verb, and is that which occurs in the Kur.:<br>\
(Msb:) ↓ انقصهُ also signifies the same; (M,<br>\
Msb, K;) and so does ↓ نقّصهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَنْقِيصٌ: (TA:) but these two are of weak<br>\
authority, and do not occur in chaste language:<br>\
(Msb:) and ↓ انتقصهُ signifies the same: (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K:) or this last signifies he took from<br>\
it by little and little; as also ↓ تنقّصهُ. (M, *<br>\
TA [in the latter of which this is plainly said of<br>\
both of the last two verbs; but in the M, it seems<br>\
rather to be said of تنقّصه only.]) [See an ex.<br>\
of the verb followed by من voce طَرَفٌ. You say<br>\
also, نَقَصَ مِنْهُ كَذَا He cut off from it such a thing.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  نَقَصَ is doubly trans.: (Msb:) you say نَقَصَهُ<br>\
حَقَّهُ, (A, Mgh, Msb, TA,) inf. n. نَقْصٌ; (A,<br>\
Mgh;) and in like manner, حَقَّهُ ↓ انتقصهُ; (M,<br>\
A, * Mgh, * TA; *) He diminished, or impaired,<br>\
to him his right, or due; endamaged him; or<br>\
made him to suffer loss, or damage, or detriment,<br>\
in respect of it; curtailed him, abridged him,<br>\
deprived him, or defrauded him, of a portion of<br>\
it; (Msb, * TA;) contr. of أَوْفَاهُ: (TA:) [and<br>\
he abridged him, deprived him, or defrauded him,<br>\
of it altogether; for نَقَصَهُ أَهْلَهُ وَمَالَهُ signifies<br>\
sometimes He deprived him of his family and his<br>\
property altogether: as appears from the following<br>\
ex.:] نُقِصَ أَهْلَهُ وَمَالَهُ وَبَقِىَ فَرْدًا [He was deprived<br>\
of his family and his property, and remained<br>\
alone]. (T, art. وتر.) الحَقِّ ↓ اِنْتِقَاصُ also signifies The denying, or disacknowledging, the right,<br>\
or due. (TA.) ―<br>\

-b2-  He<br>\
attributed to him defect, or imperfection; i. e. to<br>\
a man; (M;) as also ↓ انتقصهُ, and ↓ استنقصهُ:<br>\
(M, TA:) he attributed or imputed to him,<br>\
charged him with, or accused him of, a vice,<br>\
fault, or the like; detracted from his reputation;<br>\
censured him; reproached him; spoke against<br>\
him; impugned his character; (S, A, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ انتقصهُ: (A:) [and نَقَصَهُ signifies the same;<br>\
for] IKtt says, that ↓ نقص [app. نُقِصَ], inf. n.<br>\
نَقِيصَةٌ, signifies طعن عليه [app. طُعِنَ عَلَيْهِ].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَنَاْقَصَ see نَقَصَ, where two meanings are assigned<br>\
to it.<br>\

انتقص: see نَقَصَ.<br>\
-A2-  انتقصهُ: see نَقَصَهُ,<br>\
in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5, in two places.<br>\

استنقص الثَّمَنَ He (the buyer, S) asked,<br>\
demanded, or desired, a diminution, a lessening, a<br>\
lowering, or an abatement, of the price. (S, A,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5.<br>\
نَقْصٌ: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Used as a subst., Loss, or<br>\
loss of somewhat, decrease, a state of diminution or<br>\
lessening or washing or waning, defect, defectiveness, deficiency, incompleteness, or imperfection,<br>\
after wholeness or completeness, or perfectness;<br>\
as also ↓ نُقْصَانٌ; and ↓ مَنْقَصَةٌ signifies the same<br>\
as نَقْص] as here rendered, agreeably with the<br>\
explanation (i. e. of منقصة) in the PS., which<br>\
is كَمِىْ: or, accord. to the A, مَنْقَصَةٌ seems to<br>\
be syn. with نَقِيصَةٌ in the sense assigned to this<br>\
last in the S, or in certain senses assigned to it<br>\
in the K, which see below; and thus to be more<br>\
restricted in application than نَقْصٌ]. (S, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Weakness of intellect: (M, TA:) and weakness with respect to religion and intellect. (TA.)<br>\
You say, دَخَلَ عَلَيْهِ نَقْصٌ فِى دِينِهِ وَعَقْلِهِ<br>\
[There came upon him a weakness in his religion<br>\
and his intellect]: but one should not say<br>\
↓ نُقْصَانٌ [in this case]: (K:) app. because<br>\
النَّقْص is “ weakness; ” whereas النُّقْصَانُ is only<br>\
“ a going away [of part of a thing] after [its<br>\
having been in] a state of completeness. ” (TA.)<br>\
نُقْصَانٌ: see 1: ―<br>\
-b2-  see also نَقْصٌ, in two places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  It also signifies The quantity that is gone, or<br>\
lost, of a thing that is decreased or diminished or<br>\
lessened. (Lth, A, K.) You say, نُقْصَانُهُ كَذَا<br>\
وَكَذَا The quantity that is gone, or lost, of it is<br>\
such and such. (TK.)<br>\
نَقِيصَةٌ: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  A defect, an imperfection, a<br>\
fault, a vice, or the like; syn. عَيْبٌ: (S, TA:)<br>\
or a low, or base, quality, property, natural<br>\
disposition, practice, habit, or action; (K, TA;)<br>\
of a man: (TA:) or a weak quality, &amp;c.:<br>\
(IDrd, K, TA:) but the attribution of weakness<br>\
to a quality, &amp;c., requires consideration: and<br>\
it seems that what is meant by lowness, or baseness, is what leads to نَقْص: (TA:) [↓ مَنْقَصَةٌ,<br>\
also, accord. to the A, seems to be syn. with<br>\
نَقِيصَةٌ in one or another of the senses explained<br>\
above; but its primary signification is probably<br>\
a cause of نَقْص, like as that of مَبْخَلَةٌ is a cause<br>\
of بُخْل, and that of مَجْبَنَةٌ a cause of جُبْن:<br>\
the pl. of نَقِيصَةٌ is نَقَائِصُ: and that of مَنْقَصَةٌ is<br>\
مَنَاقِصُ.] You say, مَا فِيهِ نَقِيصَةٌ and ↓ مَنْقَصَةٌ<br>\
[There is not in him any defect, imperfection,<br>\
fault, or vice, &amp;c.]: and فُلَانٌ ذُو نَقَائِصَ and<br>\
مَنَاقِصَ [Such a one has defects, &amp;c.]. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
As a subst. from تَنَقَّصَهُ and اِنْتَقَصَهُ and اِسْتَنْقَصَهُ,<br>\
[or, accord. to IKtt, as an inf. n. from نُقِص,<br>\
and therefore from نَقَصَهُ also, (see 5,)] it signifies<br>\
The attributing to a man defect, or imperfection:<br>\
(M:) the attributing or imputing to men, charging them with, or accusing them of, vices, faults,<br>\
or the like; censuring them; reproaching them;<br>\
speaking against them; impugning their characters. (K.) A poet says,<br>\
فَلَوْ غَيْرُ أَخْوَالِى أَرَادُوا نَقِيصَتِى<br>\
جَعَلْتُ لَهُمْ فَوْقَ العَرَانِينِ مِيسَمَا<br>\
[But if others than my maternal uncles had<br>\
desired to attribute to me defect, &amp;c., I had set a<br>\
brand upon them above the noses]. (M, TA.)<br>\
نَاقِصٌ act. part. n. of 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  دِرْهَمٌ نَاقِضٌ signifies A<br>\
dirhem deficient in weight; (Msb;) light and<br>\
deficient: and نُقَّصٌ occurs as pl. of ناقص thus<br>\
applied, agreeably with analogy. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence, فِعْلٌ نَاقِصٌ meaning An incomplete,<br>\
i. e. a non-attributive, verb: opposed to فِعْلٌ تَامٌّ.]<br>\
مَنْقَصَةٌ: pl. مَنَاقِصُ: see نَقِيصَةٌ, in four places:<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  and see also نَقْصٌ.<br>\
مَنْقُوصٌ pass. part. n. of نَقَصَهُ. (A, K.)<br>\
