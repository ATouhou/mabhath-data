or string, (حُجْزَةٌ مَخِيطَةٌ: so in the S, M, L:<br>\
whence it appears that the reading in the K,<br>\
حجزة مُطيفَةٌ, is erroneous: TA: [F having, it<br>\
seems, found مُحِيطَةٌ written in the place of<br>\
مُحِيطَةٌ:]) without a نَيْفَق which is the part<br>\
turned down at the top, and sewed, through which<br>\
the waistband passes], (S, K,) tied as trousers, or<br>\
drawers, are tied: (S:) or a pair of trousers, or<br>\
drawers, having a waistband, but without a part<br>\
turned down at the top, and sewed, for the waistband to pass through: if it have this, (i. e, a. نيفق,)<br>\
it is called سَراوِيلُ: (TA;) or a piece of rag of<br>\
which the upper part is made like drawers, or<br>\
trousers: (L;) or a pair of drawers, or trousers,<br>\
without legs. (M, voce إِنْبٌ, TA,)<br>\
-A3-  نُقْبَةٌ The<br>\
state, or condition; quality, mode, or manner;<br>\

Verily she has a comely mode of veiling her face<br>\
with the نقاب. (TA.)<br>\
نِقَابٌ [A woman&#39;s face-veil;] (S, K;) a veil<br>\
that is upon [or covers] the soft, or pliable, part<br>\
of the nose; (AZ;) [not extending higher:] a<br>\
woman&#39;s veil that extends as high as the circuit<br>\
of the eye: (Msb:) it is of different modes: Fr<br>\
says, When a woman lowers her نقاب to her eye,<br>\
it [the action] is termed وَصْوَصَةٌ; and when she<br>\
lowers it further, to [the lower part of] the circuit<br>\
of the eye, it [the veil] is called نقاب; and if it is<br>\
on the extremity of the nose, it is [properly]<br>\
called لِفَامٌ: (T:) the نقاب, with the Arabs, is<br>\
that [kind of veil] from out of which appears the<br>\
circuit of the eye: and the meaning of the saying<br>\
in a trad. النِّقَابُ مُحْدَثٌ is, that women&#39;s shewing<br>\
the circuits of the eyes is an innovation; not that<br>\
they used not to veil their faces: the [kind of]<br>\
نقاب which they used reached close to the eye,<br>\
and they showed one eye while the other was<br>\
concealed; whereas the [kind of] نقاب, which<br>\
only shows both the eyes [without their circuits]<br>\
was called by them وَصْوَصَةٌ [a mistake for وَصْوَاصٌ]<br>\
and تُرْقُعٌ: [in the original, والنقاب لا يبدومنه الّا<br>\
العينان وكان اسمه الخ: but the و before كان is<br>\
erroneously introduced, and perverts the sense,<br>\
which is otherwise plain, and agreeable with what<br>\
is said before:] then they innovated the [veil]<br>\
properly called] نقاب: (A&#39;Obeyd:) pl. نَقُبٌ.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  نِقَابٌ and ↓ مِنَقَبٌ A road through a<br>\

-A3-  نِقَابٌ (a<br>\
strange form of epithet, MF,) (tropical:)  A man of great<br>\
knowledge; very knowing: (S, K:) or possessing a<br>\

mentioned by I Ath and Z, a man possessing a<br>\
knowledge of things, who scrutinizes or investigates<br>\
them much; who is intelligent, and enters deeply<br>\
into things. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  نقَابٌ The bello, Hence<br>\
the proverb, فَرْخَانِ فِى نِقَابٍ [Two young birds in<br>\
one belly]: applied to two things that resemble<br>\
one another, (K.) In like manner one says<br>\
كَانَا فِى نقاب وَاحد [They were in one belly];<br>\
meaning they were like each other, (A.)<br>\
نَقِيبٌ i. q. مَنْقُوبٌ, A thing perforated, pierced,<br>\
bored. or having a hole made through, or in. or<br>\
into it. (TA.) ―<br>\

-b3-  The tongue of a pair of scales, or balance<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  A dog having the upper part of his mindpipe (غَلْصَمَتُهُ: so in the S, K or having his<br>\
windpipe, حَنْجَرَتُهُ: so in the A) perforated, (S,<br>\
K,) in order that his cry may be weak: a base<br>\
man performs this operation on his dog, in order<br>\
that guests may not hear its cry. (S: and the<br>\
like is said in the L.)<br>\
-A2-  نَقِيبُ قُوْمٍ The intendant,<br>\
superintendent, overseer, or inspector, of a people;<br>\
he who takes notice, or cognisance, of their actions,<br>\
and is responsible for them; i. q. عَرِيفُهُمْ and<br>\
شَاهِدُهُمْ and ضَمِيُهُمْ: (S, K:) like أَمِينٌ and<br>\
كَفِيلٌ: (Zj:) their head, or chief: (TA:) like<br>\
عَرِيفٌ [q. v.]; i. e., one who is set over a people,<br>\
and investigates their affairs: (L:) or, as some<br>\
say, the greatest, or supreme, chief of a people:<br>\
so called [from نَقَبَ “ he scrutinized, or investigated,”] because he is acquainted with the secret<br>\
affairs of the people, and knows their virtues, or<br>\
generous actions, and is the way by which one<br>\
obtains knowledge of their affairs: (TA:) pl.<br>\
نُقَبَاءُ. (S.)<br>\
نِقَابَةٌ The office of نَقِيب. (Sb: see 1.)<br>\
نَقِيبَةٌ Mind: syn. نَفْسٌ. (S, K,) You say<br>\
فُلَانٌ مَيْمُونُ النقيبةِ Such a one is of a fortunate<br>\
mind, (A&#39;Obeyd, S,) when the person referred to<br>\
is fortunate in his affairs, succeeding in what he<br>\
seeks after, or strives to accomplish: (ISk, S:)<br>\
or when he is fortunate in his counsel, or advice:<br>\
(Th, S:) or the phrase signifies such a one is fortunate in his actions, and in gaining what he seeks.<br>\
(TA.) See also what follows. نَقِيبَةٌ is also said,<br>\
in the K, to signify the same as عَقْلٌ (understanding, intellect, or intelligence); but, says SM,<br>\
I have not found this in any other lexicon: only<br>\
I have found the word explained in the L as<br>\
signifying يُمْنُ الفِعْلِ (good fortune attending, or<br>\
resulting from, an action): so probably عَقْلٌ is a<br>\
mistake for فِعْلٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, Counsel, or<br>\
advice. (K.) See above. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, Penetration<br>\

نَقِيمَةٌ and عَرِيكَةٌ and طَبِيعَةٌ. (T, art. عرك.)<br>\
Agreeably with this explanation, the phrase above<br>\
mentioned is rendered in the T, in art. عرك, Such<br>\
a one is of a fortunate nature, or natural disposition: (TA:) or it signifies, in this phrase, as<br>\
also نقيمة, i. q. لَوْنٌ, Colour, complexion, species,<br>\
&amp;c. (IAar.) Also هُوَ حَسَنُ النَّقِيبَةِ He is of a<br>\
good nature, or natural disposition: and in like<br>\
manner, جَمِيلَةٍ ↓ فُلَانٌ فِى مَنَاقِبَ Such a one is a<br>\
person of good dispositions, or natural qualities.<br>\
(L.)<br>\
-A2-  نَقِيبَةٌ A she-camel having a large udder:<br>\
(ISd, K:) having her udder bound up with a<br>\
cloth or the like, on account of its greatness and<br>\
excellence: but AM says this is a corruption, and<br>\
that the correct word is ثقيبة, with ث, meaning<br>\
a she-camel “ abounding with milk. ” (TA.)<br>\
نَقَّابَةٌ: see نَقْبٌ.<br>\
نَاقِب and نَاقِبَةٌ [the former omitted in some<br>\
copies of the K] A disease that befalls a man in<br>\
consequence of long sluggishness, or indolence: (K:)<br>\
or, as some say, the ulcer that arises in the side.<br>\
(TA.) See نَقْبٌ.<br>\
أَنْقَابٌ, a pl. without a sing., The ears: (M,<br>\
K,) or, accord. to some, its sing. is نُقْبٌ. (TA.)<br>\
El-Katámee says,<br>\
كَانَتْ خُدُودُ هِجَانِهِنَّ مُمَالَةً<br>\
أَنْقَابُهُنَّ إِلَى حُدَآءِ السُّوَّقِ<br>\
[The cheeks of their white camels were with their<br>\
ears inclined to the singing of the drivers]. But<br>\
أَنَقًا بِهِنَّ, “by reason of their pleasure,” is also<br>\
read, for أَنْقَابُهُنَّ: (TA:) [so that the meaning is<br>\
The cheeks of their white camels were inclined, by<br>\
reason of their pleasure. to the singing of the<br>\
drivers].<br>\
مَنْقَبٌ The navel: or [a place] before it: (K:)<br>\
where the farrier makes a perforation in order<br>\
that a yellow fluid may issue forth: (S:) so in a<br>\
horse. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See نَقْبٌ.<br>\
مِنْقَبٌ An iron instrument with which a farrier<br>\
perforates the navel of a beast of carriage (S, K)<br>\

مَنْقَبَةٌ: see نَقْبٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  A narrow way between<br>\
two houses, (L, K,) along which one cannot pass.<br>\
(L.) It is said in a trad., that one does not<br>\
possess the right of pre-emption (الشُّفْعَة) with<br>\
respect to a منقبة; and this word is explained<br>\
as signifying a wall: syn. حَائِطٌ: [and so in the<br>\
K:] or a way between two houses, as though it<br>\
were perforated from one to the other: or a road,<br>\
or way, over an elevated piece of ground. (L.)<br>\

action, or conduct: (L:) a [good disposition, or<br>\

or generous action, and [good] internal quality:<br>\
(A:) pl. مَنَاقِبُ: (TA:) رجُلٌ ذُو مَنَاقِبَ A man<br>\
of memorable, or generous, actions, and [good]<br>\
internal qualities. (A.)<br>\
