نَجَزَ, aor.<br>\
نَجُزَ, (K,) inf. n. نَجْزٌ; (TK;) It (a thing,<br>\
S, TA,) came to an end; came to nought;<br>\
perished, passed away: (S, K, TA:) in these<br>\
senses, the former is the more chaste, and has<br>\
been so generally used that the latter has been<br>\
said to be not allowable; but both have been<br>\
heard. (TA.) It (a speech or discourse) finished,<br>\
(K, TA,) and became complete. (TA.) He (a<br>\
man) died: (S:) occurring in a verse of En-Nábighah Edh-Dhubyánee: as related by J,<br>\
نَجِزَ; but as related by A &#39;Obeyd, نَجَزَ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  نَجَزَ الوَعْدُ, (A, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
نَجُزَ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. نَجْزٌ; (Msb;) and نَجِزَ, aor.<br>\
نَجَزَ, (K;)<br>\
inf. n. نَجَزٌ; (TK;) The promise came to pass,<br>\
and was accomplished: (A, Mgh:) or the promise was prompt, or quick, in taking effect:<br>\
(Msb:) or the thing promised (TK) came, arrived, or became present: (K, TA:) in this<br>\
sense, the former is the more chaste; but both<br>\
have been heard. (TA.)<br>\

مُنَاجَزَةٌ, (S, A, Mgh, K,) He fought him: (K:)<br>\
or he went, or came, out, or forth, in the field,<br>\
to fight him, (S, Mgh, Msb,) and fought him:<br>\
(S, Mgh:) or he (a horseman) went, or came,<br>\
out, or forth, into the field, to fight him, (another<br>\
horseman,) and they strove together until each of<br>\
them slew the other, or until one of them was<br>\
slain: (TA:) and ↓ تَنَاجُزٌ signifies the same<br>\
as مُنَاجَزَةٌ: (K:) you say, تَنَاجَزَ القَوْمُ, meaning,<br>\
The people contended together in the mutual<br>\
shedding of blood; as though they hastened in<br>\
doing so. (TA.) [Hence the saying,] إِنْ رُمْتَ<br>\
المُحَاجَزَهْ فَقَبْلَ المُنَاجَزَهْ [If thou desire the reciprocal prevention of fighting, and the making<br>\
of peace, let it be before fighting]: (A:) or<br>\
المُحَاجَزَهْ قَبْلَ المُنَاجَزَهْ (S, K) [the reciprocal<br>\
prevention of fighting, and] the making of peace,<br>\
[should be] before the striving together, (المُعَالَجَة,<br>\
as in the CK,) or hastening, (المُعَالَجَة, as in<br>\
some copies of the K and in the TA, and, accord.<br>\
to the latter, المُسَارَعَة,) in fighting: (K, TA:) a<br>\
proverb: (S, TA:) relating to the prudence of him<br>\
who hastens to flee from him whom he has not<br>\
power to withstand: (K:) or applied to him who<br>\
seeks peace after fighting. (A &#39;Obeyd, K.) ―<br>\

Also, He contended with him in an altercation;<br>\
disputed with him; litigated with him. (TA.)<br>\

نَجُزَ, inf. n. نَجْزٌ<br>\
(ISk, S) and نَجَازٌ, or this is a subst. in the sense<br>\
of إِنْجَازٌ, like عَطَآءٌ in that of إِعْطَآءٌ; (Har, p. 326;)<br>\
He accomplished his want: (ISk, S, K:) and<br>\
حَاجَتَهُ ↓ نَجَّزْتُهُ I accomplished for him his want.<br>\

بِهِ: (TA:) and بِهِ ↓ نَجَزْتُهُ I made it to be<br>\
prompt, or quick in taking effect to him. (Msb.)<br>\
[Hence the saying,] أَنْجَزَ حُرٌّ مَا وَعَدَ (S, K) An<br>\
ingenuous man fulfils what he promises: a proverb: (TA:) alluding to the fulfilment of a<br>\
promise: and sometimes, to the asking, or demanding, the fulfilment thereof: El-Hárith the<br>\
son of &#39;Amr said to Sakhr the son of Nahshal,<br>\
“ Shall I guide thee to booty and one fifth of it<br>\
be for me? ” and he answered, “Yes: ” so he<br>\
guided him to some people from El-Yemen, and<br>\
Sakhr made a sudden attack upon them, and<br>\
engaged with them in conflict, and overcame, and<br>\
obtained booty; and when he turned back,<br>\
El-Hárith said to him the above words, and<br>\
Sakhr fulfilled his promise to him. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
انجز عَلَى القَتِيلِ He hastened and completed, or<br>\

or asked, or demanded, the fulfilment of the promise: (Mgh, K:) and العِدَةَ ↓ تنجّزهُ he asked<br>\
of him the fulfilment of the promise. (TA.)<br>\
Hence, البَرَاآتِ ↓ تَنَجُّزُ The demanding and receiving of immunities. (Mgh.) You say also,<br>\
إِسْتَنْجَزْتُ مِنْهُ كِتَابًا, and تَنَجَّزْتُهُ, [app. meaning, I sought, or asked, or demanded, of him the<br>\
finishing, or completion, of a writing, or letter,<br>\
or book.] (A.)<br>\
نَجْزٌ and ↓ نُجْزٌ are syn. You say, أَنْتَ عَلَى<br>\

نُجْزٌ: see نَجْزٌ.<br>\
نَجِيزٌ: see نَاجِزٌ, in three places.<br>\
نَجِيزَةٌ A recompense. You say, لَأُنْجِزَنَّ نَجِيزَتَكَ<br>\

perishing; passing away. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Complete:<br>\

to pass, and is accomplished. (A, Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
Present; ready; (S, Msb, K, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ نَجِيزٌ: (K:) and ↓ both, promptly, or quickly,<br>\
done, or given. (TA.) You say, بِعْتُهُ نَاجِزًا<br>\
بِنَاجِزٍ (S, A, Mgh, Msb) [I sold it, or I sold to<br>\
him,] present, or ready, [merchandise,] for<br>\
present, or ready, [money,] (TA,) like يَدًا بِيَدٍ,<br>\
(S, A, Mgh, Msb,) i. e., تَعْجِيلًا بِتَعْجِيلٍ. (S.)<br>\
And لَا يُبَاعُ غَائِبٌ بِنَاجِزٍ, meaning, A debt to be<br>\
paid at a future time shall not be sold for ready<br>\
money. (Mgh.) And نَاجِزٌ بِنَاجِزٍ is a proverb,<br>\
[meaning Ready merchandise with ready money,]<br>\
like يَدٌ بِيَدٍ, and عَاجِلٌ بِعَاجِلٍ. (TA.) It is<br>\
said in a trad., بِيعُوا حَاضِرًا بِنَاجِزٍ [Sell ye present<br>\
merchandise for ready money]. (S.) And a<br>\
poet (&#39;Abeed Ibn-El-Abras, TA, art. كلأ,) says,<br>\
وَإِذَا تُبَاشِرُكَ الهُمُو<br>\
مُ فَإِنَّهَا كَالٍ وَنَاجِزْ<br>\
(S, TA, ubi supra;) [And when griefs attend<br>\
thee, know that] they are, some, debts to be<br>\
payed at future periods, and some, payments<br>\
in ready money. (TA, ubi supra.) The saying<br>\
[of &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-&#39;Ámir El-Kurashee, owner<br>\
of a horse named Esh-Shamoos, (TA, art.<br>\
شمس,)]<br>\
جَرْىَ الشَّمُوسِ نَاجِزًا بِنَاجِزِ<br>\
[app. meaning, Quickly as the running of EshShamoos; ready with ready, or prompt with<br>\
prompt;] is explained by IAar, as meaning,<br>\
Thou hast given an evil recompense and I have<br>\
recompensed thee in like manner: or, as he says<br>\
in one place, this is said when one does a thing<br>\
and thou dost the like thereof; he not being able<br>\
to go beyond thee in word or in deed. (TA.)<br>\
[Respecting this saying, Freytag says, in his<br>\
Arab. Prov., i. 305, (where, for نَاجِزًا we find<br>\
نَاجِزٌ,) that it applies to him who is equal to<br>\
the execution of the things which he undertakes,<br>\
as well good as bad: and that جَرَى is to be<br>\
supplied before جَرْىَ.]<br>\
