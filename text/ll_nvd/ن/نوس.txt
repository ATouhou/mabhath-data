نَاسَ, aor. يَنُوسُ, (S, M, A, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
نَوْسٌ (S, M, A, K) and نَوَسَانٌ, (M, A, K,) It<br>\
(a thing, S, M, as a look of hair, and an carring, A) moved to and fro; (S, A, K;) it was<br>\
in a state of commotion, and moved to and fro,<br>\
(M, TA,) hanging down; (TA;) it dangled, or<br>\
hung down and was in a state of commotion or<br>\
agitation. (M, Msb [but in the M, the verb in<br>\
this last sense has only the former of the two inf.<br>\
ns. assigned to it, though the other equally helongs to it.]) You say also, نَاسَ لُعَابُهُ His<br>\
slaver flowed and was in a state of commotion.<br>\
(M.) [See also 5]<br>\
4<br>\
اناسهُ He made it to move to and fro; (S,<br>\
A;) he made it to be in a state of commotion. (M,<br>\
K, TA,) and to move to and fro, (M,) and to<br>\
hang down; (TA;) he made it to dangle, or to<br>\
hang down and be in a state of commotion or agitation. (M.) It is said in a trad. (S, M. TA.)<br>\
of Umm-Zara, (S, TA,) أَنَاسَ مِنْ حُلِىٍّ أُذُنَىَّ [He<br>\
made my two ears to move to and fro, &amp;c., with<br>\
ornaments]; (S, M, TA;) meaning, that he<br>\
ornamented her two ears with [ear-rings of the<br>\
kinds called] قِرَطَة and شُنُوف, which moved to<br>\
and fro, &amp;c., in them. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تنوّس It, (a branch of a tree,) being blown<br>\
by the wind, became shaken thereby, so that it<br>\
moved much to and fro; as also تنوّع (TA.)<br>\
[See also 1.]<br>\
نَاسٌ is applied to Men, and to jinn, or genii;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) but its predominant application is<br>\
to the former: (Msb:) it is said by some to be<br>\
applied to both in the former of the last two<br>\
verses of the Kur, الَّذِى يُوَسْوِسُ فِى صُدُورِ النَّاسِ<br>\
مِنَ الجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ [who suggesteth what is vain in<br>\
the breasts of people of the jinn and mankind];<br>\
unless by it be meant النَّاسِى [the forgetting]; or<br>\
من الجنّة والناس is added in explanation of a<br>\
preceding word, الوَسْوَاس, or of الذى, or it is in<br>\
dependence upon يوسوس; (Bd;) [but what corroborates the first explanation is the fact that]<br>\
men and jinn are both termed رِجَال in the Kur,<br>\
lxxii. 6; and the Arabs used to say, رَأَيْتُ نَاسًا<br>\
مِنَ الجِنِّ [I saw people of the jinn]: (Msb:) it<br>\
is a pl. of إِنْسٌ, (K,) originally أُنَاسٌ, (S, K,) a<br>\
pl. which is rare [as to form]; (K;) or أُنَاسٌ is<br>\
pl. of إِنْسَانٌ; (M, art. أنس;) and ناس has the<br>\
article ال prefixed to it, (S, M,) but not as a<br>\
substitute for the suppressed ء, because, were it so,<br>\
it would not be found prefixed to the original,<br>\
أُنَاسٌ, whereas it is found prefixed to this latter:<br>\
(S:) this derivation, however, from أُنَاسٌ, contradicts its belonging to art. نوس: (MF;) [but<br>\
some hold that it does belong to this art.; and<br>\
the form of its dim., to be mentioned below,<br>\
favours their opinion: Fei says,] it is a noun<br>\
applied to denote a pl., like قَوْمٌ and رَهْطٌ; and its<br>\
sing. is إِنْسَانٌ, from a different root: it is derived<br>\
from نَاسَ, aor. يَنُوسُ, signifying “ it hung<br>\
down and was in a state of commotion: ” and<br>\
[agreeably with this derivation it is said that] its<br>\
dim. is نُوَيْسٌ: (Msb:) some, again, said that<br>\
النَّاسُ is originally النَّاسِى. (L, TA, voce إِنْسٌ.)<br>\
See also إِنْسٌ, throughout.<br>\

[<br>\
نَاسُوتٌ Human nature; humanity; as also<br>\
إِنْسَِانيَّةٌ: probably post-classical: opposed to<br>\
لَاهُوتٌ, q. v., in art. ليه.]<br>\
نَوَسَاتٌ: see نُوَاسٌ.<br>\
نُوَاسٌ A [lock of hair such as is called] ذُؤَابَة,<br>\
that moves to and fro: (K, in explanation of<br>\
ذُو نُوَاسٍ the name of a king of El-Yemen:) or<br>\
↓ نُوَاسَةٌ has this signification: (A:) [the former,<br>\
therefore, is a coll. gen. n., and this is indicated<br>\
in the S; and the latter is its n. un.:] and<br>\
↓ نَوَسَاتٌ signifies i. q. ذَوَائِبُ, [pl. of ذُؤَابَةٌ,]<br>\
because they move about much. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  What<br>\
hangs to the roof, (M, A, &amp;c. [a signification<br>\
assigned in the K to نَاسٌ, probably through the<br>\
careless omission of the word النُّوَاسُ by an early<br>\
transcriber,] consisting of smoke, (A, TA,) [or<br>\
soot,] &amp;c. (TA,) The word in the T and O, as<br>\
well as in the A [and M], is نُوَاسٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\

The web of a spider: because of its fluttering.<br>\

(TA.)<br>\
نَاوُوسٌ, (M, Msb,) or نَاؤُوسٌ, (Mgh,) Burialplaces of Christians: (M:) or a burial-place of<br>\
Christians: (Mgh, Msb:) [De Sacy observes,<br>\
that En-Nuweyree and El-Makreezee constantly<br>\
use this word in speaking of the burial-places<br>\
of the ancient kings of Egypt, and that it is from<br>\
the Greek<br>\
ναο�: (“ Relation de l&#39;Égypte par<br>\
Abd-allatif; ” p. 508:) Freytag, on the authority<br>\
of Meyd., explains it as signifying a coffin in<br>\
which a corpse is enclosed: and &#39;Abd-el-Lateef<br>\
applies the (expression نَاوُوسٌ مِنْ حَجَرٍ to the<br>\
sarcophagus in the Great Pyramid: (see “ Abdollatiphi Hist. Æg. Comp.; ” p. 96:)] if Arabic,<br>\
