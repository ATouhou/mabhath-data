(IKtt, Msb, K) and نِطَارَةٌ, (Sgh, K,) He kept,<br>\
or watched, vines, (IKtt, Msb, K,) and palmtrees, (K,) and seed-produce. (TA.) See نَطْرَةٌ<br>\

نَطْرَةٌ, with the unpointed ط, signifies The act<br>\
of guarding, or watching with the eyes: and hence<br>\
the word ↓ نَاطُورٌ. (IAar, Msb, TA.)<br>\
نَطْرُونٌ, with fet-h, [Natron;] the Armenian<br>\
بَوْرَق, or بُورَق; (thus differently written here in<br>\
different copies of the K;) or [rather] the<br>\
Egyptian بُورَق: (K, art. برق:) the best kind [of<br>\
بورق] is the Armenian, which is soft, or fragile,<br>\
light, and white: then the rose-coloured: and the<br>\
strongest is the Ifreekee: there is a kind found<br>\
in Egypt, in two places: one of these is in the<br>\
western part of the country, in the neighbourhood<br>\
of a district called Et-Tarráneh; and it is transparent, green and red; the green being the more<br>\
in request; the other is in [the district called]<br>\
El-Fákooseeyeh; and this is not so good as the<br>\
former. (TA.) [See also بَوْرَقٌ.]<br>\
نُطَّارٌ A scarecrow (خَيَالٌ) set up in the midst of<br>\
seed-produce. (Sgh, K.)<br>\

نَاطُورٌ A keeper, or watcher, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,)<br>\

seed-produce: (Msb, TA:) as also ↓ نَاطُورَةٌ (ElBári&#39;, Msb) and ↓ نَاطِرٌ: (S, K:) pl. (of the first,<br>\
TA) نَوَاطِيرُ (Az, S, A, Msb, K) and (of the last,<br>\
TA) نِطَارٌ and نُطَرَآءُ and نَطَرَةٌ: (K:) it is a foreign<br>\
word, (أَعْجَمِىٌّ, K,) not pure Arabic, (TA,) of<br>\
the dial. of the people of Es-Sawád: (Lth, Msb,<br>\
TA:) Az says, I know not whether it be taken<br>\
from the language of the people of Es-Sawád or<br>\
be Arabic: (TA:) accord. to AHn, it is Arabic:<br>\
(TA:) and IAar says, that it is from نَطْرَةٌ,<br>\
meaning as explained above: (Msb, TA:) IDrd<br>\
says, that it is with ظ, (A, Msb,) from النَّظَرُ;<br>\
(A;) but in the language of the Nabatheans with<br>\
ط; (Msb;) that the Nabatheans change the<br>\
former letter into ط. (A.)<br>\
