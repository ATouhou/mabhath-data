نَذَرَ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ, (Yoo, Akh, T, S, M, A, *<br>\
K,) aor.<br>\
نَذِرَ and<br>\
نَذُرَ, (M, K,) inf. n. نَذْرٌ (Yoo, Akh,<br>\
S, M, K,) and نُذُورٌ, (M, K,) [He made a vow;<br>\
imposed upon himself a vow; أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا that<br>\
he would do such a thing; either absolutely, or<br>\
conditionally, as will be explained below;] he<br>\
made [a future action] binding, or obligatory, on<br>\
himself; (T, M, A, K;) as also ↓ انتذر. (K.)<br>\
And نَذْرًا ↓ انتذر signifies the same as نَذَرَ [He<br>\
vowed a vow]. (Sgh.) You say also نَذَرْتُ مَالِى,<br>\
aor.<br>\
نَذُرَ [and<br>\
نَذِرَ as implied in the K] inf. n. نَذْرٌ, [I<br>\
vowed my property; made a vow to give it.]<br>\
(Yoo, Akh, S, K. *) And نَذَرْتُ لِلّٰهِ كَذَا, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
نَذُرَ and<br>\
نَذِرَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. نَذْرٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) I made it binding, or obligatory, on myself, [i. e., I vowed,] of my own free will, to do or<br>\
to give such a thing to God; namely, some religious service, or an alms, &amp;c.: (TA:) or نَذْرٌ<br>\
signifies the promising conditionally; as when one<br>\
says, “Such a thing shall be obligatory on me if<br>\
God restore to health my sick [son or other]: ”<br>\
this is termed نَذْرٌ: but the saying “ I impose<br>\
upon myself the giving a deenár as alms,” is not<br>\
so termed. (K.) The doing this is repeatedly<br>\
forbidden in traditions: but what is meant thereby is, one&#39;s doing so in the belief that he may<br>\
attain by it something which God has not decreed<br>\
to betide him, or that he may divert from himself<br>\
something decreed to befall him: yet if he do so,<br>\
fulfilment is obligatory on him. (IAth.) You<br>\
say also, نَذَرَ الوَلَدَ, (M, K,) and نَذَرَتْهُ, (M,) He<br>\
(the father, M, K) and she (the mother, M) appointed the child [by a vow] to be a minister or<br>\
servant to the church, (M, K,) or to a place<br>\
appropriated to religious services or exercises, or<br>\
acts of devotion: (TA:) so in the Kur, iii. 31.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
-A2-  نَذِرَ بِالشَّىْءِ, aor.<br>\
نَذَرَ, (M, IKtt, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. نَذَرٌ (M, IKtt) and نَذَارَةٌ and نِذَارَةٌ, (IKtt,)<br>\
or, as some assert, it has no inf. n., like عَسَى &amp;c.,<br>\
the Arabs being content to use in its stead أَنْ<br>\
followed by the verb, as is said in the &#39;Ináyeh,<br>\
on the Kur, chap. xiv., (MF,) He knew of the<br>\
thing: (Msb:) or he knew of the thing and was<br>\
cautious of it or on his guard against it or in fear<br>\
of it. (M, K.) You say also نَذِرَ القَوْمُ بالعَدُوِّ<br>\
(S, A) The people knew of the enemy: (S:) or<br>\
knew of the enemy and prepared themselves for<br>\
them: (A:) or knew of the enemy and were<br>\
cautious of them or on their guard against them<br>\
or in fear of them. (TA.) And it is said in a<br>\
trad., إِنْذَرِ القَوْمَ Have thou knowledge of the<br>\
people and be cautious of them or on thy guard<br>\
against them or in fear of them. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَنْذَرْتُهُ بِالأَمْرِ, (M, K,) and انذرته الشَّىْءَ,<br>\
(Msb,) inf. n. إِنْذَارٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and نُذْرٌ<br>\
(M, K) the latter accord. to Kr, but correctly it<br>\
is a simple subst., (M,) and نُذُرٌ, (T, K,) or this is<br>\
pl. of نَذِيرٌ, (T,) and نَذْرٌ, (K,) accord. to Lh<br>\
and Kr, (TA,) [but this is properly a simple<br>\
subst.,] and نَذِيرٌ, (M, K,) accord. to Zj, (M,)<br>\
or Ez-Zejjájee, (TA,) but this should rather be<br>\
regarded as a simple subst., (T, M,) I informed<br>\
him, or advised him, of the thing: (M, K, TA:)<br>\
this is the primary signification: (TA:) and [I<br>\
warned him of the thing;] I cautioned him, or<br>\
put him on his guard, against the thing, and put<br>\
him in fear, (M, * K,) in my communication or<br>\
announcement: (K:) in this sense the verb is<br>\
used in the Kur, xl. 18: (M, TA:) or I announced to him the thing, (S, * Msb,) generally in<br>\
a case of putting in fear the person addressed, or<br>\
frightening him, (Msb,) or never otherwise than<br>\
in such a case: (S:) and thus the verb is used<br>\
in the Kur, ubi supra., وَأَنْذرْهُم يَوْمَ آلازِفَةِ [And<br>\
warn them and put them in fear of the day of<br>\
the approaching event, the day of resurrection]<br>\
meaning, put them in fear of its punishment:<br>\
(Msb:) and أَنْذَزْتُهُ بِكَذَا I informed him, or<br>\
advised him, of such a thing. (Msb.) انذرهُ<br>\
also signifies He (a spy) informed him, or<br>\
advised him, of the state of the enemy: in the<br>\
copies of the K, نَذَرَهُ; but this is a mistake.<br>\
(TA.) And you say, أَنْذَرْتُ القَوْمَ مَسِيرَ العَدُرِّ<br>\
إِلَيْهِمْ I informed the people of the march of the<br>\
enemy towards them, to put them on their guard.<br>\
(T.) And أَنْذَرْتُ القَوْمَ بِالعَدُوِّ, and أَنْذَرْتُهُمُ العَدُوَّ,<br>\
signify the same. (A.) It is said in a proverb,<br>\
قَدْ أَعْذَرَ مَنْ أَنْذَرَ, meaning, He hath become<br>\
excused, and averted from himself the blame of<br>\
men, who hath warned thee that he will punish<br>\
thee for a future evil deed proceeding from thee,<br>\
if thou then do the evil deed and he punish<br>\
thee. (T.) See also أَعْذَرَ, in two places: and<br>\
see عُذْرٌ.<br>\
6<br>\
تناذر القَوْمُ The people warned, or cautioned,<br>\
one another, or put one another in fear, (M, K,)<br>\
of a terrifying evil. (TA.) You say تناذر القَوْمُ<br>\
كَذَا The people warned one another, (S,) and<br>\
put one another in fear, of such a thing. (S, A.)<br>\
A poet says, (S,) namely, En-Nábighah, (T,<br>\
TA,) describing a serpent, (T,) and his being<br>\
threatened by En-Noamán so that he passed the<br>\
night as though he had been stung, turning over<br>\
and over upon his bed, (TA,)<br>\
تَنَاذَرَهَا الرَّاقُونَ مِنْ سُوْءِ سَمِّهَا<br>\
تُطَلِّقُهُ طَوْرًا وَطَوْرًا تُرَاجِعُ<br>\
[Of which the charmers have warned one another,<br>\
and put one another in fear, on account of the<br>\
evil nature of its poison, which it discharges one<br>\
time and one time draws back]. (T, S, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِنْتَذَرَ see نَذَرَ, in two places.<br>\
10<br>\
استنذر إِلَيْهِ He offered warning to him<br>\
(A, TA, art. عذر.) See استعذر.<br>\
نَذْرٌ A vow, which a man makes to be binding,<br>\
or obligatory, on himself; (T, M, * K, * TA;)<br>\
[either absolutely, or conditionally: (see نَذَرَ:)]<br>\
pl. نُذُورٌ: (S, M, K: *) and in the following<br>\
verse of Ibn-Ahmar, some say that نُذُر is pl. of<br>\
نَذْرٌ, like as رُهُنٌ is pl. of رَهْنٌ; but others say<br>\
that it is pl. of نَذِيرٌ in the sense of مَنْذُورٌ:<br>\
كَمْ دُونَ لَيْلَى مِنْ تَنُوفِيَّةٍ<br>\
لَمَّاعَةٍ تُنْذَرُ فِيهَا النُّذُرْ<br>\
[How many a waterless desert glistening with<br>\
the mirage, in which vows, or things vowed,<br>\
are vowed, lie in the way to Leylà!]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, (tropical:)  The mulct for an intentional wound;<br>\
used in this sense by Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, (T, TA,)<br>\
and of the dial. of El-Hijáz; (TA;) i. q. أَرْشٌ,<br>\
(T, A, K, TA,) which is of the dial. of the<br>\
people of El-&#39;Irák: (T, TA:) pl. نُذُورٌ: (T, A,<br>\
K:) said by Aboo-Nahshal to be only for<br>\
wounds, small and great. (T, K. *) You say,<br>\
لِى قِبَلَ فُلَانٍ نَذْرٌ, (T, TS, L,) or عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ,<br>\
(K,) (tropical:)  A mulct for a wound is owed to me.<br>\
(T, K, &amp;c.) And أَعْطَيْتُهُ نَذْرَ جُرْحِهِ (tropical:)  I gave<br>\
him the mulct for his wound. (A.) Aboo-Sa&#39;eed<br>\
Ed-Dareer says that it is thus called لِأَنَّهُ نُذِرَ فِيهِ,<br>\
i. e., because it is made binding, or obligatory,<br>\
for it; [namely, for the wound;] from the<br>\
phrase نَذَرْتُ علَى نَفْسِى. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [A<br>\
votive offering].<br>\
-A2-  See also نُذْرٌ.<br>\
نُذْرٌ (M) and ↓ نُذُرٌ (T, S, K) [and ↓ نَذْرٌ<br>\
(see 4)] and ↓ نَذِيرٌ (S, M) and ↓ نَذِيرَةٌ (M)<br>\
and ↓ نِذَارَةٌ (Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, K) and ↓ نُذْرَى (K)<br>\
are substs. in the sense of إِنْذَارٌ [meaning An<br>\
informing, or advising, of a thing: and a warning, or cautioning, and putting one on his guard,<br>\
against a thing, and putting one in fear of a<br>\
thing; &amp;c.: (see 4:)] (T, S, M, K:) or a putting<br>\
one in fear in announcing a thing. (TA.) عُذْرًا<br>\
أَوْ نُذْرًا and عُذُرًا أَوْ نُذُرًا, accord. to different<br>\
readings, in the Kur, lxxvii. 6, put in the<br>\
accus. case as causal complements, signify لِلْإِعْذَارِ<br>\
وَالْإِنْذَارِ [For excusing and warning]. (Zj, T.)<br>\
[See also art. عذر.] And in like manner, ↓ نُذُرِ,<br>\
in the Kur, liv. 16, &amp;c., signifies إِنْذَارِى. (S, K.)<br>\
And so ↓ نَذِيرِ, in the Kur, lxvii. 17. (T, M.)<br>\
Hence also the saying of the Arabs, عُذْرَاكَ لَا<br>\
نُذْرَاكَ, meaning, أَعْذِرُ وَلَا تُنْذِرْ [i. e. Do thou<br>\
that for which thou wilt be excused, by inflicting<br>\
punishment when it is deserved, and do not merely<br>\
warn and put in fear]. (TA.)<br>\
نُذُرٌ: see نُذْرٌ.<br>\
نُذْرَى: see نُذْرٌ.<br>\
نَذِيرٌ i. q. ↓ مُنْذِرٌ, (T, S, M, A, Msb, K,) as<br>\
also ↓ نَذِيرَةٌ; (M;) i. e. [One who gives information, or advice, of a thing, or things: and one<br>\
who warns;] one who cautions; (M, TA;) and<br>\
who puts in fear: (TA:) one who gives notice to<br>\
a people of an enemy, or other thing, that has<br>\
come upon them; (TA;) a spy who gives notice,<br>\
to a people, of an enemy, to put them on their<br>\
guard; (A;) and in like manner ↓ نَذِيرَةٌ, a spy<br>\
who informs an army of the state of the enemy:<br>\
(T, K:) نَذِيرٌ is of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense<br>\
of the measure مُفْعِلٌ: (M, L:) or its verb was<br>\
نَذَرَ, but this has become obsolete: (T:) its pl.<br>\
is نُذُرٌ; (M, Msb, K;) occurring in the Kur,<br>\
liv. 23, [&amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ابو مُنْذِرٍ The<br>\
cock (Har. p. 644). ―<br>\
-b3-  [And also,] النَّذِيرُ The<br>\
apostle: (M, K:) so in the Kur, xxxv. 34,<br>\
accord. to Th: (M:) the prophet Mohammad:<br>\
(T, K:) so, accord. to most of the expositors, in<br>\
that verse of the Kur. (T.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Hoariness, or<br>\
whiteness of the hair: (T, M, K:) so, accord.<br>\
to some, in the verse of the Kur, last referred<br>\
to: (T, M:) but the explanation immediately<br>\
preceding is more probable. (T.) ―<br>\
-b5-  The sound<br>\
of a bow: (AHn, M, K:) because it warns,<br>\
or frightens, (يُنْدِرُ,) that which is shot at. (AHn,<br>\
M.)<br>\
-A2-  I. q. مَنْذُورٌ [i. e. Vowed]: pl. نُذُرٌ. (S.)<br>\
See نَذْرٌ.<br>\
-A3-  See also نُذْرٌ.<br>\
نِذَارَةٌ: see نُذْرٌ.<br>\
نَذِيرَةٌ [A votive gift;] that which he gives who<br>\
makes a vow. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A child appointed<br>\
by the father (M, K) and mother (M) [by a<br>\
vow] to be a minister, or servant to the church,<br>\
(M, K,) or to a place appropriated to religious<br>\
services, or exercises, or acts of devotion: (T:)<br>\
pl. نَذَائِرُ. (T.)<br>\
-A2-  See also نَذِيرٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A3-  And see نُذْرٌ.<br>\
نَاذِرٌ: see مُنَذِّرٌ.<br>\
