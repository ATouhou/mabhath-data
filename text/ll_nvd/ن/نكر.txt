نَكِرَهُ: see 4, in several places.<br>\
-A2-  نَكُرَ, inf. n.<br>\
نَكَارَةٌ, [He was, or became, ignorant: or perhaps<br>\
only the inf. n. of the verb in this sense is used:<br>\
see نَكَارَةٌ, below. ―<br>\
-b2-  And, contr., He possessed<br>\
cunning; meaning both intelligence with craft<br>\
and forecast; and simply intelligence, or skill<br>\
and knowledge: or perhaps only the inf. n. of<br>\
the verb in this sense is used: see نَكْرٌ. ―<br>\
-b3- ] It<br>\
(a thing, or an affair,) was, or became, مُنْكَر [app.<br>\
here meaning disapproved; or bad, evil, abominable, or foul; or disallowed]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also,<br>\
(S, K,) inf. n. نَكَارَةٌ, (TK,) or نُكْرَةٌ, (TA,) It (a<br>\
thing, or an affair,) was, or became, difficult,<br>\
hard, arduous, or severe. (S, K. *)<br>\
2<br>\
نكّرهُ, (inf. n. تَنْكِيرٌ, Msb,) He changed, or<br>\
altered, him or it, (S, A, Msb, TA,) to an<br>\
unknown state, (S, TA,) so as not to be known;<br>\
(TA;) [he disguised him or it.] It is said in<br>\
the Kur, [xxvii. 41,] نَكِّرُوا لَهَا عَرْشَهَا Alter ye her<br>\
throne so that it may not be known to her.<br>\
(TA.) See also 4, last signification but one.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [In grammar, He made it (a noun) indeterminate.]<br>\
3<br>\
ناكرهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. مُنَاكَرَةٌ, (A, K,)<br>\
He strove, or endeavoured, to outwit, deceive,<br>\
beguile, or circumvent, him; or he practised<br>\
with him mutual deceit, guile, or circumvention;<br>\
syn. خَادَعَهُ and دَاهَاهُ: the inf. n. is also explained by مُرَاوَغَةٌ as well as مُخَادَعَةٌ [both of<br>\
which signify the same]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
(TA,) He contended with him in fight; (S, K;)<br>\
and in war, or hostility. (A, K.) It is said<br>\
of Mohammad, by Aboo-Sufyán (S, TA) Ibn-<br>\
Harb, (TA,) لَمْ يُنَاكِرْ أَحَدًا إِلَّا كَانَتْ مَعَهُ<br>\
الأَهْوَالُ, (S, TA,) meaning, He did not war<br>\
with any one without being aided by terror<br>\
[cast into the hearts of his opponents]. (TA.)<br>\
And one says, بَيْنَهُمَا مُنَاكَرَةٌ Between them two<br>\
is war, or hostility, (A, TA, *) and fighting.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
انكرهُ, (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. إِنْكَارٌ;<br>\
(Msb, &amp;c.;) and ↓ نَكِرَهُ, (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
نَكَرَ, (L,) or it does not admit the variations<br>\
of tense like other verbs, (IKtt, Msb,) it is not<br>\
used in the future tense, nor in commanding nor<br>\
in forbidding, (Lth,) inf. n. نَكَرٌ (K) and نُكْرٌ and<br>\
نُكُورٌ (S, K) and نَكِيرٌ; (K;) and ↓ استنكرهُ; (S,<br>\
M, A, K;) and ↓ تناكرهُ; (M, K;) signify the<br>\
same; (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.;) i. e., He ignored,<br>\
was ignorant of, did not know, failed to know, or<br>\
[rather] was unacquainted with, it (i. e. a thing,<br>\
or an affair, IKtt, K) or him (a man, S);<br>\
syn. جَهِلَهُ; (Kr, K;) or contr. of عَرَفَهُ: (S, *<br>\
IKtt, Msb:) [see also نَكَارَةٌ:] some, however,<br>\
say, the نَكِرَ has a more intensive signification<br>\
than أَنْكَرَ: and some, that نَكِرَ has for its objective<br>\
complement an object of the mind; and أَنْكَرَ, an<br>\
object of the sight: (A, TA:) or [the converse<br>\
is the case;] نَكِرَ has for its objective complement<br>\
an object of the sight; and أَنْكَرَ, an object of the<br>\
mind: (Kull, p. 81:) [but both forms seem to<br>\
have been generally used indiscriminately.] ElAashà says,<br>\
وَأَنْكَرَتْنِى وَمَا كَانَ الَّذِى نَكِرَتْ<br>\
مِنَ الحَوَادِثِ إِلَّا الشَّيْبَ وَالصَّلَعَا<br>\
[And she did not know me; and the accidents<br>\
which she did not know were none others than<br>\
hoariness, and baldness of the fore part of the<br>\
head]. (S, TA.) And it is said in the Kur,<br>\
[xi. 73,] وَأَوْجَسَ مِنْهُمْ خِيفَةٌ ↓ نَكِرَهُمْ [He knew<br>\
not what they were, and conceived a fear, or a<br>\
kind of fear, of them]: (TA:) نَكِرَهُمْ here signifies أَنْكَرَهُمْ: (Jel:) or it means أَنْكَرَ ذٰلِكَ مِنْهُمْ<br>\
[q. v. infra]. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَنْكَرَهُ also signifies He<br>\
denied, or disacknowledged, it; (L, art. جحد;<br>\
[and this signification, as well as the first, may<br>\
be meant to be indicated by those who say that<br>\
أَنْكَرَهُ signifies the contr. of عَرفَهُ;]) [and so ↓ نَكِرَهُ;<br>\
for] إِنْكَارٌ signifies i. q. جُحُودٌ, (S, TA,) and so<br>\
نُكْرَانٌ [which is an inf. n. of نَكِرَهُ]. (TA.) [In<br>\
this sense it is doubly trans.:] you say, أَنْكَرْتُهُ<br>\
حَقَّهُ, meaning, I denied, or disacknowledged, to<br>\
him his right. (Msb.) The cause of إِنْكَار with<br>\
the tongue is إِنْكَار with the mind, but sometimes<br>\
the tongue denies, or disacknowledges, (يُنْكِرُ,)<br>\
a thing when the image thereof is present in the<br>\
mind; and this is lying; as is the case in the<br>\
following passage of the Kur, [xvi. 85,] يَعْرِفُونَ<br>\
نِعْمَةَ اللّٰهِ ثُمَّ يُنْكِرُونَهَا [They confess, or acknowledge, the favour of God; then they deny, or disacknowledge, it]. (B.) See also نَكِيرٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also,<br>\
He deemed it strange, extraordinary, or improbable. (MF, voce عَجَبٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also He denied,<br>\
or negatived, it. ―<br>\
-b3-  He disbelieved it. ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
He disapproved it; he disliked it; he deemed it,<br>\
or declared it to be, bad, evil, abominable, or<br>\
foul; he disallowed it: so accord. to explanations of the pass. part. n., q. v. infra; and<br>\
accord. to common usage of classical and of<br>\
modern times.] It is said of Abraham, when<br>\
the angels came to him, and he saw that their<br>\
hands did not touch the meat which be had<br>\
brought to them, نَكِرَهُمْ, meaning, أَنْكَرَ ذٰلِكَ مِنْهُمْ<br>\
[He deemed that conduct of their&#39;s evil, or disapproved it: or, perhaps, he did not know<br>\
what that conduct of their&#39;s was, or what it<br>\
indicated]: ↓ نَكِرَ and أَنْكَرَ and ↓ استنكر [of which<br>\
last see an ex. voce تَهِمَ] signify the same. (Bd,<br>\
xi. 73.) And you say, أَنْكَرْتُ عَلَيْهِ فِعْلَهُ, meaning, I blamed, or found fault with, his deed,<br>\
and forbade it; I disapproved and disallowed<br>\
his deed. (Msb:) [and I manifested, or showed,<br>\
or declared, disapproval, or disallowance, of his<br>\
deed: and in like manner, أَنْكَرْتُ عَليْهِ, elliptically; فِعْلَهُ, (his deed,) or قَوْلَهُ, (his saying;)<br>\
or the like, being understood; like عَيَّرَ عَلَيْهِ for<br>\
عَيَّرَ عَلَيْهِ فِعْلَهُ or the like: see نَكِيرٌ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  إِنْكَارٌ<br>\
also signifies The changing [a thing; like تَنْكِيرٌ]:<br>\
(T, Msb, TA:) or the changing what isمُنْكَر<br>\
[here app. meaning disapproved: see نَكِيرٌ, which<br>\
is syn. with it, but is a simple subst.]. (S, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  مَا أَنْكَرَهُ How great it his cunning! meaning<br>\
both his intelligence, and craft, and forecast; and<br>\
simply, his intelligence, or skill and knowledge.<br>\
(TA.) And مَا كَانَ أَنْكَرَهُ How great was his<br>\
cunning, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تنكّر He, or it, changed, or altered, himself,<br>\
or itself; or became changed, or altered; (S, A,<br>\
Msb, TA;) to an unknown state: (S, TA:)<br>\
[he assumed an unknown appearance: he disguised himself; or became disguised:] he became<br>\
changed or altered in countenance by anger so<br>\
that he who saw him did not know him: (Har,<br>\
p. 144:) or تَنَكُّرٌ signifies the changing, or altering oneself, or itself; or becoming changed, or<br>\
altered; from a state which pleases one to a<br>\
state which one dislikes. (T, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  إِيَّاكَ وَالتَّنَكُّرَ<br>\
Avoid thou evil disposition. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  تَنَكَّرَ لِى<br>\
فُلاَنٌ Such a one [became changed, or altered, in<br>\
countenance to me by anger so that I did not<br>\
know him; or] met me in a morose manner<br>\
(A, TA.) [In art. شنف in the K, تَنَكَّرَهُ occurs.]<br>\
6<br>\
تناكرهُ: see 4, first signification. ―<br>\
-b2-  تناكر<br>\
He feigned ignorance. (S, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  تناكروا<br>\
They acted with mutual hostility. (TS, A, K.)<br>\
10<br>\
اشتنكرهُ: see 4, first signification, and also<br>\
in the latter part. ―<br>\
-b2-  اِسْتِنْكَارٌ also signifies The<br>\
inquiring respecting, or seeking to understand, a<br>\
thing, or an affair, which one disapproves; (K,<br>\
TA;) when one disapproves confirming, or establishing, the opinion expressed by an inquirer, or<br>\
disapproves that his opinion should be contrary<br>\
to what he has expressed. (TA.)<br>\
نَكْرٌ: see نُكْرٌ.<br>\
-A2-  See also نَكِرٌ.<br>\
نُكْرٌ (S, K) and ↓ نَكْرٌ [but the former is the<br>\
more common] and ↓ نَكَارَةٌ (S, A, K) and ↓ نَكْرَآءُ<br>\
(A, K) Cunning; meaning both intelligence mixed<br>\
with croft and forecast; and [simply] intelligence,<br>\
or sagacity, or skill and knowledge; syn. دَهَآءٌ;<br>\
(S, A, K;) and فِطْنَةٌ. (A, K.) See also نَكُرَ.<br>\
You say of a man who is intelligent and evil, or<br>\
cunning, مَا أَشَدَّ نُكْرَهُ, and ↓ نَكْرَهُ [How great is<br>\
his cunning, &amp;c.!] (S.) And فَعَلَهُ مِنْ نُكْرِهِ, and<br>\
↓ نَكَارَتِهِ, He did it of his cunning, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
And it is said in a trad. of Mo&#39;áwiyeh, إِنِّى لَأَكْرَهُ<br>\
النَّكَارَةَ فِى الرَّجُلِ Verily I hate cunning (الدَّهَآءَ) in<br>\
the man. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  نُكْرٌ, as an epithet, applied<br>\
to a thing, or an affair, Difficult, hard, arduous,<br>\
or severe; as also ↓ نُكُرٌ (M, A, K) and ↓ نَكِيرٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and i. q. مُنْكَرٌ, q. v. (S, A, K.)<br>\
نَكَرٌ [app. Difficulty, hardness, arduousness, or<br>\
severity;] a subst. from نَكُرَ, in the sense of صَعُبَ<br>\

epithets applied to a man, Possessing cunning; or<br>\
intelligence mixed with cunning and forecast; (S,<br>\
K;) and [simply] intelligent, or skilful and<br>\
knowing: (K:) and so, applied to a woman,<br>\
↓ نُكُرٌ (K) and ↓ نَكْرٌ (L, TA [but this is probably<br>\
a mistake for ↓ نُكُرٌ]) and ↓ نَكْرَآءُ, but أَنْكَرُ is not<br>\
applied to a man in this sense, (Az, TA,) nor is<br>\
مُنْكَرَةٌ to a woman: (TA:) pl. of the first and<br>\
second (S, K,) and third, (K,) أَنْكَارٌ: (S, K:)<br>\
and of the last, مَنَاكِيرُ: (Sb, S, K:) or, applied<br>\
to men, مُنْكَرُونَ; and to other things, مَنَاكِيرُ<br>\
[which is irreg.]. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, نَكِرٌ and<br>\
↓ نَكُرٌ One who disapproves what is bad, evil,<br>\
abominable, or foul; expl. by أَلَّذِى يُنْكِرُ الْمُنْكَرَ:<br>\

trad, كُنْتَ لِى أَشَدَّ نَكَرَةً, (TA,) i. e. إِنْكَارًا, (TK,)<br>\
[Thou wast to me most ignorant. &amp;c.]<br>\

It is said in the Kur, xlii. 46. فَمَا لَكُمْ مِنْ نَكِيرٍ<br>\
And there shall be for you no [power of] denial<br>\
of your sins. (Bd, Jel.) And one says, شُتِمَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ فَمَا كَانَ عِنْدَهُ نَكِيرٌ [Such a one was reviled<br>\
and he had no denial to make]. (A.) ―<br>\

[a thing]: (T, Msb, TA:) or the changing what<br>\
is مُنْكَر [here app. meaning disapproved]: (S,<br>\
TA:) a simple subst. (T, TA.) The words of<br>\
the Kur, [xxii. 43 and lxvii. 18,] فَكَيْفَ كَانَ نَكِيرِ<br>\
are explained as signifying And how was my<br>\
changing [of their condition]! (TA:) or the<br>\
meaning is, and how was my manifestation of<br>\
disapproval of their conduct, (إِنْكَارِى عَلَيْهِمْ,) by<br>\
changing favour into trial, and life into destruction, and a flourishing condition into a state of<br>\
ruin! (Bd, xxii. 43.) In [some of] the copies<br>\
of the K, it is said that نَكِيرَةٌ [but in a MS. copy<br>\
I find نَكِيرٌ and so in the CK] is a subst. from<br>\
تَنَكُّرٌ as signifying the changing, or altering, oneself, or itself; or becoming changed, or altered;<br>\
from a state which please one to a state which<br>\
one dislikes: but a different statement is found in<br>\

نَكَارَةٌ: see نَكِرَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  See also نُكْرٌ.<br>\
أَنْكَرُ Worse, and worst; more, and most, evil,<br>\

-b2-  See also نَكِرٌ: and<br>\
the fem., نَكْرَآءُ, see above.<br>\

including several significations, here following.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Ignored, or unknown; as also ↓ مَنْكُورٌ, for<br>\
مَنْكُورٌ is syn. with مَجْهُولٌ [the pass. part. n. of<br>\
the verb by which أَنْكَرَهُ is explained by Kr and<br>\
in the K]; (TA;) and ↓ مُسْتَنْكَرٌ signifies the<br>\
same. (L.) For the pls. of مُنْكَرٌ, see نَكِرٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Denied, or disacknowledged. (See the verb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Deemed strange, extraordinary, or improbable,<br>\

declared, thereby, to be bad, evil, hateful, abominable, foul, unseemly, ugly, or hideous; or pronounced to be so by the law because the mind<br>\
deliberates respecting the regarding it as such:<br>\
and thus it is used in the Kur, ix. 113 [and other<br>\
places]: (B, TA:) or anything pronounced to be<br>\
bad, evil, hateful, abominable, or foul, and forbidden, and disapproved, disliked, or hated, by<br>\
the law: (TA:) a saying, or an action, unapproved, not approved, unaccepted, or not accepted,<br>\
by God: (KT:) unbecoming, indecent, or indecorous. (KL.) See مَعْرُوفٌ, voce عُرْفٌ. مُنْكَرٌ<br>\
and ↓ نُكْرٌ and ↓ نُكُرٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ نَكْرَآءُ<br>\
(S, Msb K) are all syn., (S, A, Msb, K,) [and<br>\
are used as epithets in which the quality of a<br>\
subst. predominates,] signifying a bad, an evil,<br>\
a hateful, an abominable, a foul, an unseemly, an<br>\
ugly, or a hideous, [and a formidable,] thing or<br>\
affair [or action or saying or quality, &amp;c.]: (Msb:)<br>\
[in this sense, its pl. is مُنْكَرَاتٌ and مَنَاكِيرُ; as<br>\
will be seen below:] ↓ نُكْرٌ is contr. of عُرْفٌ [which<br>\
is syn. with مَعْرُوفٌ]. (TA.) You say فِيهِمُ<br>\
الْمَعْرُوفُ وَالْمُنْكَرُ, and العُرْفُ والنُّكْرُ, [In them are<br>\
good and evil qualities.] And هُمْ يَرْكَبُونَ الْمُنْكَرَاتِ,<br>\
and المَنَاكِيرَ, [They commit bad, evil, abominable,<br>\
or foul, actions.] (A.) And it is said in the<br>\
Kur, [xviii. 73,] لَقَدْ جِئْتَ شَيْئًا نُكْرًا [Verily thou<br>\
hast done a bad, an evil, an abominable, or a foul,<br>\
thing]. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  The name of one of two angels,<br>\
the other of whom is named نَكِيرٌ; (S;) who are<br>\
the two triers of [the dead in] the graves. (ISd,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A3-  See also نَكِرٌ.<br>\
مَنْكُورٌ: see مُنْكَرٌ, first signification. The pl. is<br>\
مَنَاكِيرُ, [which is also a pl. of مُنْكَرٌ,] accord. to<br>\
Sb, who mentions it because, accord. to rule, the<br>\
pl. of a sing. of this class is formed by the addition of و and ن for the masc., and ا and ت for<br>\
the fem. (Abu-l-Hasan, TA.)<br>\
خَرَجَ مُتَنَكِّرًّا He went forth disguised; or<br>\
