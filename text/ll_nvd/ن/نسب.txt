day.] ―<br>\
-b14-  نَسَبَ بِالْمَرْأَةِ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
نَسِبَ, (S,) and<br>\
نَسُبَ, (L,) inf. n. نَسِيبٌ (S, K) and نَسَبٌ and مَنْسَبَةٌ,<br>\

he mentioned the woman in amatory language, in<br>\
the beginning of a قَصِيدَة, and then turned to the<br>\
object of praise: [for it is a general rule to commence a قصيدة in praise of a king, or hero, or<br>\
the like, with نسيب; the transition from this is<br>\
termed التَّخَلُّصُ: see also اِقْتَضَبَ:] (IKh:) he<br>\
mentioned the woman in his poem, describing her<br>\
as characterized by beauty and youth &amp;c.: (Lb:)<br>\
or describing her as characterized by good qualities, whether truly or falsely. (Z.) This phrase<br>\
and نَسَبَ الرَّجُلَ both signify description; the<br>\

the woman as characterized by beauty and youth<br>\

5<br>\
تنسّب He asserted himself to be a relation,<br>\
or kinsman, or to be related, [إِلَيْكَ] to thee.<br>\

-b2-  انتسب إِلَى أَبِيهِ He<br>\
asserted his relationship to his father, whether<br>\
truly or falsely; (S;) [saying, I am the son of<br>\
such a one: as was generally done by a champion<br>\
when he sallied forth to challenge]. ―<br>\
-b3-  انتسب<br>\
إِلَيْهِ It (a voice) was attributed, or ascribed, to<br>\
him. (TA, art. غنث.)<br>\
10<br>\
استنسب (K) and ↓ انتسب (TA) He<br>\
mentioned his [i. e. his own] relationship, [lineage,<br>\
or genealogy]. (K.) One says to a man, in<br>\
asking him respecting his relationship, &amp;c.,<br>\
إِسْتَنْسِبْ لَنَا أَىْ إِنْتَسِبْ لَنَا حَتَّى نَعْرِفَكَ [Mention thy relationship, or lineage, to us, that we<br>\
may know thee]. (AZ.)<br>\

to and fro between them two with malicious and<br>\
mischievous misrepresentations, calumnies, or slanders, &amp;c. (L, K.)<br>\
نَسْبٌ: see نَسَبٌ.<br>\

race; lineage; parentage; pedigree; genealogy;<br>\
origin; reputed relationship or lineage or origin;]<br>\
(K;) with respect to father and mother; (ISk;)<br>\
or with respect to fathers only: (K:) pl. of the<br>\
first, أَنْسَابٌ; (S;) of the ↓ second, نِسَبٌ; and<br>\
of the ↓ third, نُسَبٌ. (Msb.) The first, by<br>\
poetical license, is contracted into ↓ نَسْبٌ. (T.)<br>\
[You say,] بَيْنَهُمَا نَسَبٌ Between them is relationship; said whether they may lawfully marry one<br>\
another, or not. (Msb.) See نَسِيبٌ.<br>\
نِسْبَةٌ (tropical:)  Relation; proportion; comparison;<br>\
with respect to quantity, or measure, and the<br>\
like. See نَسَبٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  بِنِسْبَةِ كَذَا In proportion<br>\
to such a thing. ―<br>\
-b3-  نِسْبَةُ العَشَرَةِ إِلَى المِائَةِ The<br>\
proportion of ten to a hundred is [that of a<br>\
tenth]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [You also say بِالنِّسْبَةِ إِلَى كَذَا<br>\

thing.] ―<br>\
-b5-  نِسْبَةٌ A name of relation to a father,<br>\
mother, tribe, town or district, art or trade, &amp;c.:<br>\
[as عَلَوِىٌّ, فَاطِمِىٌّ, قُرَشِىٌّ, مَكِّىٌّ, جَوْهَرِىٌّ:] ending<br>\
with ىّ. A more general name of this kind<br>\
should precede a more particular one: thus you<br>\
say القُرَشِىُّ الهَاشِمِىُّ: and it is better that a<br>\
name of relation to a tribe should precede one<br>\
of relation to a town or the like: thus you say<br>\
القُرَشِىُّ المَكِّىُّ. It is said that the Arabs originally called themselves by such names only<br>\
in relation to tribes; and that, when they took<br>\
up their abodes in cultivated lands and in cities,<br>\
they borrowed names of relation to towns and<br>\
the like from the Persians and Copts. (Msb.)<br>\

(S, K, TA.) Ex. بَيْنَ الشَّيْئَيْنِ نسبةٌ, and<br>\
↓ مناسبةٌ, and ↓ تناسبٌ, Between the two things<br>\
is a resemblance, &amp;c. بَيْنَهُمَا نسبةٌ قَرِيبَةٌ. Between them two is a near resemblance, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
[نِسْبَةٌ حُكْمِيَّةٌ The relation of a predicate to its<br>\
subject (in books on logic).]<br>\
نُسْبَةٌ: see نَسَبٌ.<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  نَسِيبٌ (S, K) and ↓ مَنْسُوبٌ (K) One related; a<br>\
relation; a kinsman. (S, K, TA.) You say<br>\

↓ نَسَبٌ, also, is used for ذُو نَسَبٍ [A relation, or<br>\
kinsman]; and means a male, or female, relation;<br>\

a woman, or of women, in the beginning of a<br>\
poem] is a phrase like شَعْرٌ شَاعِرٌ. (K.) See<br>\
أَنْسَبُ.<br>\
نَسَّابٌ (K) and ↓ نَسَّابَةٌ (S, K.) Skilful in<br>\
genealogy: (K:) [or rather, the former signifies<br>\
very skilful in genealogies; or a great genealogist:] the latter, possessing the utmost knowledge in genealogies; or a most skilful genealogist:<br>\
[this being of a doubly intensive form;] the ة<br>\
being annexed to render the epithet one of excessive praise: (S:) pl. of the former نَسَّابُونَ, and<br>\
of the latter نَسَّابَاتٌ: (TA:) you say عِنْدِى ثَلَاثَةُ<br>\
نسّاباتٍ, meaning ثلاثة رِجَالٍ نسّاباتٍ. (S.)<br>\
نَسَّابَةٌ: see نَسَّابٌ.<br>\

watering-places. (TA.)<br>\
نَيْسَبَانٌ: see نَيْسَبٌ.<br>\
هٰذَا الشِّعْرُ أَنْسَبُ This poetry is more, or most.<br>\
elegant in what is termed نَسِيب. see 2: (K:)<br>\
as though they had said نَسِيبٌ نَاسِبٌ, like شِعْرٌ<br>\
شَاعِرٌ, to give intensiveness to the signification,<br>\
and thence formed the word أَنْسَبُ. (TA.)<br>\
