نَآءَ, aor. يَنُوْءُ, inf. n. نَوْءٌ (S, K) and تَنْوَآءٌ,<br>\
(K,) He rose, or arose, with effort and difficulty.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَآءَ بِحِمْلِهِ He rose with his burden<br>\

بِصَدْرِهِ He arose. [App. said originally, if not<br>\
only, of a camel.] (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  نَاءَ بِهِ and ↓ اناءهُ,<br>\
It (a burden) oppressed him by its weight, and<br>\
bent him, or weighed him down. (S, K,) ―<br>\

بِهَا عَجِيزَتُهَا Her buttocks oppress her by their<br>\
weight: said of a woman. (S.) ―<br>\
-b7-  نَآءَ He was<br>\
oppressed by weight, (K,) and fell down: (S, K:)<br>\
thus the verb bears two [partially] opposite significations. (K.) ―<br>\

to some), or rose (accord. to others), aurorally,<br>\
i. e. at dawn of morning. (TA.) See نَوْءٌ. [It<br>\
seems that ناء is used in both these senses because<br>\
the star or asterism appears as though it were<br>\
nearly overcome by the glimmer of the dawn.]<br>\

استناء بِنَجْمٍ [He prognosticated rain &amp;c.<br>\
by reason of the rising or setting of a star or an<br>\
asterism aurorally, i. e., at dawn of morning: or<br>\
he regarded a star or an asterism as a نَوْء].<br>\
(L.) It is said, لَا تَسْتَنِىءُ العَرَبُ بِالنُّحُومِ كُلِّهَا<br>\
[The Arabs do not prognosticate rain &amp;c. by<br>\
reason of the auroral rising or setting of all the<br>\
stars, or asterisms: or do not regard all the<br>\
stars or asterisms as أَنْوَا. (Sh, L.) إِسْتَنْأَوْا<br>\
الوَسْمِىَّ, the ء being transposed, They expected, or<br>\
looked for, the rain called الوسمى, [from the<br>\
auroral rising or setting of a star or an<br>\
asterism]. (AHn.)<br>\
-A2-  إِسْتَنَآءَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He sought, or<br>\
asked a gift, or present of him. (K.)<br>\
نَوْءٌ, pl. أَنْوَآءٌ and نُوآنٌ, (S, K,) A star, or<br>\
an asterism, verging to setting: or the setting<br>\
of the star, or asterism, in the west, aurorally,<br>\
i. e., at dawn of morning, and the rising of<br>\
another, opposite to it, at the same time, in the<br>\
east: (K:) or the setting of one of the stars, or<br>\
asterisms, which compose the Mansions [of the<br>\
Moon (see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ)], in the west, aurorally,<br>\
i. e., at dawn of morining, and the rising of its<br>\
رَقِيب, which is another star, or asterism, opposite<br>\
to it, at the same time, in the east, each night<br>\
for a period of thirteen days: thus does each<br>\
star, or asterism, of those Mansions, [one after<br>\
another,] to the end of the year, except الجَبْهَة,<br>\
the period of which is fourteen days: (S:) [or<br>\
it signifies the auroral rising, and sometimes the<br>\
auroral setting, of one of those stars, or asterisms;<br>\
as will be shown below: I do not say “ heliacal ”<br>\
rising because the rising here meant continues<br>\
for a period of thirteen days]. Accord. to the T,<br>\
نوء signifies the setting of one of the stars, or<br>\
asterisms, above mentioned: and AHn says,<br>\
that it signifies its first setting in the morning,<br>\
when the stars are about to disappear; which is<br>\
when the whiteness of dawn diffuses itself. (TA.)<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd says, I have not heard نوء used in the<br>\
sense of “ setting,” “ falling,” except in this<br>\
instance. (S.) It is added, [whether on his or<br>\
another&#39;s authority is doubtful,] that the [pagan]<br>\
Arabs used to attribute the rains and winds and<br>\
heat and cold to such of the stars, or asterisms,<br>\
above mentioned as was setting at the time<br>\
[aurorally]; or, accord. to As, to that which<br>\
was rising in its ascendency [aurorally]; and<br>\
used to say, مُطِرْنَا بِنَوْءِ كَذَا [We have been given<br>\
rain by such a نوء]; (S;) or they attributed heat<br>\
[and cold] to the rising or the star or asterism,<br>\
and rain [and wind], to its نَوْء [meaning its<br>\
setting]. (AHn, Har, p. 216.) This the Muslim<br>\
is forbidden to say, unless he mean thereby,<br>\
“ We have been given rain at the period of such<br>\
a نوء; ” God having made it usual for rain to<br>\
come at [certain of] the periods called انواء.<br>\
Again, A&#39;Obeyd says, The انواء are twenty-eight<br>\
stars, or asterisms; sing. نوء: the rising of any<br>\
one of them in the east [aurorally] is called نوء;<br>\
and the star, or asterism, itself is hence thus<br>\
called: but sometimes نوء signifies the setting.<br>\
Also, in the L it is said, that each of the abovementioned stars, or asterisms, is called thus because, when that in the west sets, the opposite<br>\
one rises; and this rising is called النّوء; but<br>\
some make نوء to signify the setting; as if it<br>\
bore contr. senses. (TA.) [El-Kazweenee mentions certain physical occurrences on the occasions<br>\
of the انواء of the Mansions of the Moon; and in<br>\
each of these cases, except three, the نوء is the<br>\
rising, not the setting. Two of the excepted<br>\
cases are doubtful: the passage relating to the<br>\
third plainly expresses an event which happens<br>\
at the period of the auroral setting of الصَّرْفَة;<br>\
namely the commencement of the days called<br>\
أَيَّامُ العَجُوزِ; corresponding, accord. to ElMakreezee, with the rising of الفَرْغُ المُقَدَّمُ, the<br>\
رقيب of الصرفة: and it is said in the S, art. عجز,<br>\
on the authority of Ibn-Kunáseh, that the ايّام<br>\
العجوز fall at the period of the نوء of الصرفة.<br>\
(The auroral setting of الصرفة, at the commencement of the era of the Flight, in central<br>\
Arabia, happened about the 9th of March O. S.;<br>\
and this is the day of the N. S., the 26th of<br>\
February O. S., on which commence the ايّام<br>\
العجوز accord. to the modern Egyptian almanacs.)<br>\
Hence it appears, that sometimes the setting, but<br>\
generally the rising, was called the نوء. Moreover, the ancient Arabs had twenty-eight proverbial sayings (which are quoted in the Mir-át<br>\
ez-Zemán, and in the work of El-Kazweenee)<br>\
relating to the risings of the twenty-eight Mansions of the Moon: such as this: إِذَا طَلَعَ الشَّرَطَانْ<br>\
إِسْتَوَى الزَّمَانْ “ When Esh-Sharatán rises, the<br>\
season becomes temperate: ” or, perhaps, “―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
the night and day, become equal. ” (If this<br>\
latter meaning could be proved to be the right<br>\
one, we might infer that the Calendar of the<br>\
Mansions of the Moon was in use more than<br>\
twelve centuries B. c.; and that for this reason<br>\
الشرطان was called the first of the mansions;<br>\
though it may have been first so called at a<br>\
later period as being the first Mansion in the<br>\
first Sign of the Zodiac. But I return to the<br>\
more immediate object which I had in view in<br>\
mentioning the foregoing sayings.) I do not<br>\
find any of these sayings (though others, I<br>\
believe, do) relating to the settings. Hence, again,<br>\
it appears most probable, that the rising, not the<br>\
setting, was generally called نوء.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [In many<br>\
instances,] الأَنْوَآءُ signifies The Mansions of the<br>\
Moon [themselves]; and نَوْءٌ, any one of those<br>\
Mansions: and they are also called نُجُومُ المَطَرِ<br>\
[the stars, or asterisms, of rain]. (Mgh, in art.<br>\
خطأ.) IAar says that the term نوء was not<br>\
applied except in the case of a star, or asterism,<br>\
accompanied by rain: (TA:) [see exs. under<br>\
خَطَّ and خَطَّأَ: but most authors, it seems, apply<br>\
this term without such restriction: it is sometimes given to certain stars or asterisms, which<br>\
do not belong to the Mansions of the Moon; as<br>\
will be seen below: and it is applied, with the<br>\
article, especially to الثُّرَيَّا]. ―<br>\
-b4-  Accord. to AZ,<br>\
as cited by AM, the first rain is that called<br>\
الوَسْمِىُّ: the انواء of which are those called<br>\
العَرْقُوَتَانِ المُؤَخَّرَتَان, the same, says AM, as الفَرْغُ<br>\
المُؤَخَّرُ, [the 27th Mansion of the Moon, which,<br>\
about the period of the commencement of the era<br>\
of the Flight, (to which period, or thereabout,<br>\
the calculation of AZ, here given, most probably<br>\
relates,) set aurorally, (for by the term نوء AZ<br>\
means a star or asterism, at the setting of which<br>\
rain usually falls,) in central Arabia, on the 21st<br>\
of Sept. O. S, as shewn in the observations on<br>\
the منازل القمر in this lexicon]: then, الشَّرَطُ,<br>\
[one of the شَرَطَانِ, the 1st Mansion, which, about<br>\
the period above mentioned, set aurorally on the<br>\
17th of Oct.]: then, الثُّرَيَّا, [the 3rd Mansion,<br>\
which, about that period, set on the 12th of<br>\
Nov.]. Then comes the rain called الشَّتَوِىُّ: the<br>\
انواء of which are الجَوْزَاءُ [meaning الهَقْعَةُ, the<br>\
5th Mansion, which, about the period above<br>\
mentioned, set aurorally on the 8th of Dec.]<br>\
then, الذِّرَاعَانِ, [i. e. الذِّرَاعُ المَقْبُوضَةُ and الدِّرَاعُ<br>\
المَبْسُوطَةُ; the former of which, about the same<br>\
period, set anti-heliacally on the 3rd of January,<br>\
the proper relative time of the setting of the 7th<br>\
Mansion; and the latter, on the 16th of January,<br>\
the proper relative time of the setting of the 8th<br>\
Mansion;] and their نَثْرَة, [the 8th Mansion,<br>\
which, about that period, set aurorally on the<br>\
16th of Jan.]: then, الجَبْهَةُ, [the 10th Mansion,<br>\
which set aurorally, about that period, on the<br>\
11th of Feb.] In this period the شتوى rain<br>\
ends; and that called الدَّفَئِىُّ (q. v.) begins, and<br>\
[after this] الصَّيْفُ. All the rains from the وسمى<br>\
to the دفئى are called رَبِيعٌ. Then, [after the<br>\
دفئى,] comes the صَيْف: the انواء of which are<br>\
السِّمَاكَانِ (الأَعْزَلُ and الرَّقِيبُ); [the former of<br>\
which is, accord. to El-Kazweenee, the 14th<br>\
Mansion, which, about the period above mentioned, set aurorally on the 4th of April: the<br>\
latter seems to be the رقيب of الثريّا (see رقيب):<br>\
i. e. الإِكْلِيلُ, the 17th Mansion, which, about the<br>\
same period, set aurorally on the 13th of May;<br>\
a period of about forty days. Then comes الحَميمُ.<br>\
[see this word, said by some to be] a period of<br>\
about twenty nights, commencing at the [auroral]<br>\
rising of الدَّبَرَان, [at the epoch of the Flight<br>\
about the 26th of May, O. S.,] which has [little<br>\
rain, or none, and is therefore said to have] ??<br>\
نوء. Then comes الخَريفُ [a period of little rain<br>\
the انواء of which are النَّسْرَانِ [or the two vultures, النَّسْرُ الوَاقِعُ and النَّسْرُ الطَّائِرُ, which, in<br>\
central Arabia, about the period above mentioned,<br>\
set aurorally on the 24th of July, O. S., both<br>\
together]: then, الخضر, [which I have not been<br>\
able to identify with any known star or asterism,<br>\
in the TT with صح written above it, to denote<br>\
its being correctly transcribed]: then, العَرْقُوَتَانِ<br>\
الأُولَيانِ, the same says AM, as الفَرْغُ المُقَدَّمُ,<br>\
the 26th Mansion, which, about the same period,<br>\
set on the 8th of Sept.]. (T, TT, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
[Hence,] نَوْءٌ [also means (assumed tropical:)  The supposed effect of<br>\
a star or asterism so termed in bringing rain &amp;c.:<br>\
whence the phrase لَا نَوْءَ لَهُ It has no effect upon<br>\
the weather; said of a particular star or<br>\
asterism: see البُطَيْنُ. ―<br>\
