نَجَشَ, aor.<br>\
نَجُشَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. نَجْشٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) He concealed himself. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
[And hence, He pursued game, or objects of the<br>\
chase: (see نَاجِشٌ:) or] he roused game, or<br>\
objects of the chase, (S, Mgh, K,) and scared<br>\
them from place to place. (TA.) You say also,<br>\
نَجَشُوا عَلَيْهِ الصَّيْدَ, meaning, They scared the chase,<br>\
or game, towards him, and drove and collected it to<br>\
him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He searched after a thing, and<br>\
roused it. (Sh, A&#39;Obeyd, K.) This, accord. to<br>\
Sh, is the primary signification: [but accord. to<br>\
Fei, the primary signification is the first given<br>\
above:] and hence the saying in a trad., لَا تَطْلُعُ<br>\
الشَّمْسُ حَتَّى تَنْجُسُهَا ثَلٰثُمِائَةٍ وَسِتُّونَ مَلَكًا The sun<br>\
does not rise until three hundred and sixty angels<br>\
rouse it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He drew forth, educed, or<br>\
elicited. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He collected together (S, K)<br>\
camels [&amp;c.] after a state of dispersion. (S.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
He drove vehemently. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  نَجَشَ, aor.<br>\
نَجُشَ,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) inf. n. نَجْشٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K)<br>\
and نَجَشٌ, [which is the form generally used by<br>\
the professors of practical law,] (ISh, Mgh, Sgh,<br>\
TA,) or this is a simple subst., (Msb,) He<br>\
demanded the sale of an article of merchandise for<br>\
more than its price, (A, Mgh, Msb,) not meaning<br>\
to purchase it, (Mgh, Msb,) in order that another<br>\
might see him and fall into the snare thus laid for<br>\
him: and in like manner it is used with respect to<br>\
marriage, [i. e., with respect to dowers,] and other<br>\
things: (A, Mgh, Msb:) and the doing thus is<br>\
forbidden: (Mgh:) it is from نَجَشَ signifying<br>\
“ he roused ” game: (Mgh:) or from the same<br>\
verb signifying “ he concealed himself; ” because<br>\
he who does so conceals his intention: (Msb:) or<br>\
he augmented the price of an article of merchandise, not desiring to purchase it, but in order that<br>\
another might hear him and augment in the same<br>\
manner: (A&#39;Obeyd, L:) or he outbade in a sale,<br>\
in order that another might fall into a snare, he<br>\
himself not wanting the thing: (S:) or he augmented the price of an article of merchandise, or<br>\
praised it, in order that another might see that,<br>\
and be deceived by him: (Ibráheem El-Harbee:)<br>\
or he praised an article of merchandise belonging<br>\
to another in order that he might sell it, or dispraised it in order that it might not be easy for<br>\
him to sell it: (ISh:) or he concurred with a<br>\
man desiring to sell a thing, by praising him:<br>\
(Abu-l-Khattáb, K:) or he bargained with a man<br>\
desiring to sell a thing, offering him a large price,<br>\
in order that another might see him and fall into<br>\
a snare: or he scared people from one thing to<br>\
another: (K:) also, he praised a thing; or<br>\
praised it exceedingly, or for that which was not<br>\
in it, or excessively and falsely; syn. مَدَحَ شَيْئًا and<br>\
أَطْرَاهُ: and he invented, or forged, a lie. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., (S,) ↓ لَا تَنَاجَشُوا, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) i. e., Ye shall not practise نَجْش, or نَجَش:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) or ↓ تَنَاجُشٌ signifies the bidding one<br>\
against another, successively increasing their offers,<br>\
in a sale, or other case; (K;) for it sometimes signifies the doing so in the case of a dowry, in order<br>\
that the doing so may be heard, and the amount may<br>\
consequently be augmented: (TA:) and Sh mentions, with respect to ↓ تَنَاجُشٌ, on the authority<br>\
of Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, another thing, which is allowable, namely, [that it signifies the conspiring to<br>\
promote the marriage of] the woman who has<br>\
been married and divorced time after time; and<br>\
[the sale of] the article of merchandise that has<br>\
been bought time after time and then sold. (TA.)<br>\

with kesr to the ن, which is said to be the more<br>\
chaste, (K,) and is preferred by Th, (TA,) but<br>\
