menstrual discharge is later than its usual time,<br>\
and who is therefore hoped to be pregnant: (S,<br>\
K:) pl. [of نسء] أَنْسَآءٌ and نُسُوْءٌ: and نِسْوَةٌ نِسَآءٌ<br>\

see نَسْءٌ.<br>\
نَسَآءٌ Length of life. (Akh, S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The<br>\
Fakeeh of the Arabs [El-Hárith Ibn-Keledeh,<br>\
as said in the Mz, close of 39th نوع, where the<br>\
following is quoted,] says, مَنْ سَرَّهُ النَّسَآءُ وَلَا<br>\
نَسَآءَ فَلْيُخَفِّفِ الرِّدَآءَ وَلْيُبَاكِرِ الغَدَآءَ وَلْيُؤَخِّرِ العَشَآءَ<br>\
وَلْيُقِلَّ غِشْيَانَ النِّسَآءِ [Let him whom length of life<br>\
rejoiceth (but there is no long endurance in life)<br>\
lighten his debts, and make his morning-meal<br>\
early, and delay his evening-meal, and take little<br>\
enjoyment in women]: (S, * TA:) الرداء here<br>\
means debt. (T, M, TA, in art. ردى, where<br>\
this saying is cited with some variations.)<br>\
نَسِىْءٌ, of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولٌ, (S,) A month which the Arabs,<br>\
in the time of paganism, postponed: (K:) the<br>\
doing of which is forbidden in the Kur, ix. 37.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, as an inf. n. of نَسَأَ, (which it is<br>\
also said to be in the L,) The postponing of a<br>\
month: i. e., the postponing of the sacredness of<br>\
a month; transferring it to another month.<br>\
When the Arabs returned from Mina, [after the<br>\
accomplishment of the pilgrimage,] it was customary for a man of the tribe of Kináneh to arise<br>\
and say, أَنَا الَّذِى لَا يُرَدُّ لِى قَضَآءٌ [“ I am he<br>\
whose decree is not to be rejected ”]; (S;) or<br>\
إِنِّى لَا أُحَابُ وَلَا أُعَابُ وَلَا يُرَدُّ قَوْلِى, or ولا يردّ<br>\
مَا قَضَيْتُ بِهِ; [“ Verily I am not to be accused<br>\
of a sin, nor am I to be charged with a<br>\
fault, nor is my saying, (or decree,) to be rejected; ”] (TA;) whereupon they would say,<br>\
أَنْسِئْنَا شَهْرًا [“ Postpone for us a month ”]; i. e.,<br>\
“ Postpone for us the sacredness of El-Mo-<br>\
harram, and transfer it to Safar: ” for they disliked that three months during which they might<br>\
not make predatory expeditions should come upon<br>\
them consecutively, as their subsistence was<br>\
obtained by such expeditions: so he made ElMoharram free from restriction to them. (S.)<br>\
[But this, as appears from what is said in the<br>\
Kur, ix. 37, was not done every year.] The<br>\
tribes of Teiyi and Khath&#39;am did not observe the<br>\
sacred months; therefore the نَاسِئ (or postponer)<br>\
proclaimed it lawful to slay them therein, when<br>\
they were aggressors. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [The term<br>\
نَسِىْء appears also to have been applied to The<br>\
postponement of the time of the pilgrimage; which<br>\
was another custom of the Pagan Arabs, mentioned under this word in the TA.] The Arabs,<br>\
liking that the day of their return from pilgrimage should always be at one season of the<br>\
year, postponed it every year eleven days; at<br>\
the same time keeping sacred the two months<br>\
in which the pilgrimage took place, and the<br>\
month next after those two, and also the month<br>\
of Rejeb, at whatever season this fell. (TA.)<br>\
[For the same purpose, at one time, they used<br>\
to intercalate a month in the third and sixth and<br>\
eight of every eight years. See Kur, ix. 36,<br>\
where the prohibition of this custom is implied; and Sale&#39;s Prel. Disc., § vii.]. ―<br>\

K,) like كُلْأَةٌ, (S,) A postponement, or delay,<br>\
as to the time of the payment of a debt, or of the<br>\
price of a thing sold, &amp;c. (S, K, TA.) The first<br>\
is a subst.; (K;) and also an inf. n.; (L;)<br>\
[and each of the others seems to be sometimes<br>\
used as such]. ―<br>\
-b6-  ↓ بَاعَهُ بِنَسِيْئَةٍ, and ↓ بِنُسْأَةٍ, (as<br>\
also بِكُلْأَةٍ, S,) He sold it on credit; for payment<br>\

in the K it is said, كُلُّ نَاسِئٍ سَمِينٌ: in the L,<br>\

of multiplying wealth, a means of prolonging<br>\
one&#39;s memorial]. (TA, from a trad.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
مِنْسَأَةٌ.<br>\
مِنْسَأَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ مَنْسَأَةٌ, (K,) and also without ء, (S, K,) A staff, or stick: so called because<br>\
a beast is urged or driven with it: (K:) a<br>\
pastor&#39;s great staff. (TA.) For مِنْسَأَتَهُ, in the<br>\
Kur, xxxiv. 13, some read مِنْ سَأَتِهِ; i. e. “ from,<br>\
or of, the end of his staff; ” سأَة originally signifying the “ bent part at each end of a bow; ”<br>\
(Fr, TA, &amp;c.;) and being here used tropically.<br>\
(TA.) This reading is disapproved by the author<br>\
of the K. but is supported by good authorities.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُنْتَسَأٌ An interval; a distance; a space.<br>\
(S.) إِنَّ لِى عَنْكَ لَمُنْتَسَأٌ Verily I am far from<br>\
