نَصَرَهُ, (M, A, K,) aor.<br>\
نَصُرَ, (M,) inf. n. نَصْرٌ<br>\
(M, A, K) and نُصْرَةٌ, (A,) or this is a simple<br>\
subst., (S, Msb,) and نُصُورٌ, (K,) [but see the<br>\
verse of Khidásh in what follows,] He aided or<br>\
assisted him, (M, K,) namely, a person wronged,<br>\
misused, or treated unjustly or injuriously, (M.<br>\
A, K,) against his enemy: (TA:) [he avenged<br>\
him: (see the verse here following, and see 8:)<br>\
he supplied his want, or somewhat thereof (TA.)<br>\
Kidásh Ibn-Zuheyr says.<br>\
فَإِنْ كُنْتَ تَشْكُو مِنْ خَلِيلٍ مَخَانَةً<br>\
فتِلْكَ الجَوَازِى عَقْبُهَا وَنُصُورُهَا<br>\
[And if thou complain of treachery from a friend.<br>\
those requitals are its result and its avengers, or<br>\
avengement]: here نُصُور may be a pl. of نَاصِرٌ.<br>\
like شُهُودٌ is of شَاهِدٌ; or it may be an inf. n.,<br>\
like دُخُولٌ and خُرُوجٌ. (M.) You say, تَصَرَهُ<br>\
عَلَى عَدُوِّهِ, (S, A, Msb,) and مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ, (A,<br>\
Msb,) aor.<br>\
نَصُرَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. نَصْرٌ (S, A, Msb)<br>\
and نُصْرَةٌ, (A,) or this, as remarked above, is<br>\
a simple subst., (S, Msb.) He (namely, God.<br>\
S, A, or a man, Msb,) aided or assisted him, and<br>\
strengthened him, against his enemy: (Msb:)<br>\
[he avenged him of his enemy. (See 8.)] And<br>\
نَصَرَهُ اللّٰهُ God made him to be victorious, to<br>\
conquer, or to overcome: so in the Kur, xxii. 15,<br>\
where the pronoun relates to Mohammad. (TA.)<br>\
In the Kur, xlvii. 8. إِنْ تَنْصُرُوا اللّٰهَ يَنْصُرْكُمْ<br>\
means, If ye aid God&#39;s religion and his apostle,<br>\
He will aid you against your enemy: (Bd, Jel)<br>\
or if ye aid his servants, &amp;c.: or if ye keep his<br>\
ordinances and aid his orders and comply with<br>\
his commands and shun the things which He hath<br>\
forbidden, &amp;c. (El-Basáïr.) And the trad.<br>\
أُنْصُرْ أَخَاكَ ظَالِمَّا أَوْ مَظْلُومًا is explained as<br>\
meaning, Prevent thou thy brother from wronging when he is a wronger, and aid him against<br>\
his wronger when he is wronged. (TA.) Also,<br>\
نَصَرَهُ مِنْهُ, (K,) inf. n. نَصْرٌ and نُصْرَةٌ, (TA,) [or<br>\
the latter in this sense, as in the cases above<br>\
mentioned, is a simple subst.,] He served or<br>\
Preserved him from him or it. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَصَرَاللّٰهُ<br>\
الأَرْضَ God gave rain to the earth or land. (A.)<br>\
And نَصَرَ الغَيْثُ الأَرْضَ (S, M, K,) [aor.<br>\
نَصُرَ,]<br>\
inf. n. نَصْرٌ, (M,) (tropical:)  The rain aided the earth or<br>\
land: (S:) or watered it: (M:) or watered it<br>\
generally and copiously, (K, TA,) and caused it<br>\
to produce herbage: (TA:) and نَصَرَ البَلَدَ (tropical:)  it<br>\
assisted the country to produce abundance of<br>\
herbage: (TA:) and نُصِرَتِ الأَرْضْ (tropical:)  the earth<br>\
or land was watered by rain. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence,<br>\
نَصَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
نَصُرَ, inf. n. نَصْرٌ, (tropical:)  He gave to him.<br>\
(M.) An Arab of the desert [in the A a beggar]<br>\
accosted a people saying, أُنْصُرُونِى نَصَرَكُمُ اللّٰهُ,<br>\
meaning, (tropical:)  Give ye to me: may God give to you.<br>\
(M, A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  نَصَرَهُ اللّٰهُ also signifies (assumed tropical:) God bestowed upon him the means of subsistence, or the<br>\
like; syn. رَزَقَهُ. (IKtt.)<br>\
2<br>\
نصّرهُ, (inf. n. تَنْصِيرٌ, K,) He made him a<br>\
Christian. (S, M, K.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
[relating to the natural disposition of a child to<br>\
adopt the true faith,] فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ وَيُنَصِّرَانِهِ<br>\
[But his two parents make him a Jew or make<br>\
him a Christian]. (S.)<br>\
3<br>\
نَاْصَرَ [ناصرهُ He rendered reciprocal aid to him.<br>\
See an ex. voce عَاصَرَ.]<br>\
5<br>\
تنصّر He laboured, or strove, to aid, or<br>\
assist; syn. عَالَجَ النَّصْرَ: (M, K:) not of the<br>\
same category as تَحَلَّمَ [he endeavoured to acquire حِلْم] and تبرّر [he endeavoured to characterize himself by بِرّ]. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  He became a<br>\
Christian. (M, K.)<br>\
6<br>\

(M, A, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تناصرت الأَخْبَارُ (tropical:)  The<br>\
accounts, or tidings, confirmed, or verified, one<br>\
another. (M, K, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\

or injurer. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  انتصر مِنْهُ He exacted,<br>\
or obtained, his right, or due, completely, from<br>\
him, so that each of them became on a par with<br>\
the other: (Az, TA:) he revenged himself upon<br>\
him. (Az, S, M, * Msb, K.)<br>\
10<br>\
استنصر He asked, sought, or desired, aid,<br>\
or assistance. (M, K.) And استنصره He asked<br>\
him to aid him, (S, Msb, K,) عَلَيْهِ against him,<br>\
(S, K,) i. e. against his enemy. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
(tropical:)  He begged; (K;) as though he asked for a<br>\
gift, which is termed نَصْر. (TA.)<br>\
نَصْرٌ [used a subst.,] Aid or assistance, rendered<br>\
to another, especially against an enemy: [avengement or another:] victory or conquest: (Bd,<br>\
xxix. 9:) and ↓ نُصْرَةٌ is a subst. from نَصَرَهُ [and<br>\
therefore signifies the same]: (S, Msb:) or the<br>\
↓ latter signifies good aid, or assistance: (M,<br>\
K:) and this ↓ same word, when the object is<br>\
God, signifies aid of God&#39;s servants; &amp;c.; as<br>\
explained above: see 1. (El-Basáïr.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Spoil;<br>\
plunder; booty. (Bd, ubi supra.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  Rain;<br>\
(A, TA;) as also ↓ نُصْرَةٌ: (TA:) in like manner<br>\
as it is called فَتْح: (A, TA:) or the ↓ latter<br>\
signifies a complete rain. (IAar.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,]<br>\
(tropical:)  A gift: (S, TA:) and نَصَائِرُ gifts. (M.) ―<br>\

نَصْرِىٌّ: see نَصْرَانِىٌّ.<br>\
نَصْرَانٌ: see نَصْرَانِىٌّ.<br>\
نَصْرَانِىٌّ, (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ نَصْرَانٌ,<br>\
(M, A,) or this latter has not been used without<br>\
the addition of the relative ى, (S,) or it has<br>\
been sometimes used, (M,) and ↓ نَصْرِىٌّ, (M,<br>\
Msb, K,) but we have not heard this used,<br>\
(M,) [A Christian: or this is a secondary application, and the original meaning is a Nazarene:] fem. نَصْرَانِيَّةٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) and<br>\
نَصْرَانَةٌ, (S, A, K,) or the latter is used only<br>\
by poetic licence: (IB:) ↓ نَصَارَى [applied to<br>\
the Christians] is a rel. n. from نَاصِرَةُ, [or Nazareth,] a town of Syria, (S, M, K,) also called<br>\
نَصْرَانَةُ, (Lth, IDrd, K,) or نَصْرَانُ, (S, Msb,)<br>\
and نَصُورِيَةٌ, (M, Sgh, K,) without teshdeed,<br>\
accord. to Sgh, (TA,) and نُصْرِىٌّ and نُصْرَى,<br>\
(as in a copy of the M,) or نَصْرَى and نَصْرَوَةُ:<br>\
(TA:) so originally, and then applied to such<br>\
as hold the religion of its inhabitants: (Msb:)<br>\
this is the opinion of the lexicologists; but it is<br>\
of weak authority, though admissible as there<br>\
are other anomalous rel. ns.: (M:) or [so in<br>\
K, but in the S, and] نَصَارَى is pl. of نَصْرِىٌّ,<br>\
(Kh, M, Msb, K,) like as مَهَارَى is pl. of مَهْرِىٌّ;<br>\
(Msb, K;) or of نَصْرَانٌ (Kh, S, M) and نَصْرَانَةٌ,<br>\
(S,) like as نَدَامَى is pl. of نَدْمَانٌ (Kh, S, M)<br>\
and نَدْمَانَةٌ; (S;) but more probably of نَصْرَانٌ,<br>\
because this word has been sometimes used,<br>\
whereas we have not heard نَصْرِىٌّ used: (M:)<br>\
and it is implied in the copies of the K, that<br>\
أَنْصَارٌ is pl. of نَصْرَانِىٌّ; but correctly, it is a pl.<br>\
of نَصْرَانٌ, without ى, as is said in the TS, and<br>\
the L, in both of which is mentioned the saying<br>\
of the poet,<br>\
لَمَّا رَأَيْتُ نَبَطًا أَنْصَارَا<br>\
[When I saw Nabatheans, Christians], meaning<br>\
نَصَارَى. (TA.)<br>\
النَّصْرَانِيَّةُ The religion of the نَصَارَى [or Christians]. (K, TA.)<br>\
نَصُورٌ One who aids, or assists, much or well.<br>\

pl. (of نَصِيرٌ, (S, M, Msb, and of نَاصِرٌ, M,)<br>\
أَنْصَارٌ (S, M, A, Msb, K) and (of نَاصِرٌ, M)<br>\
نُصَّارٌ, (M, K,) and نُصُورٌ may also be a pl. of<br>\
the same, as occurring in the verse of Khidásh,<br>\
cited above: (M:) and أَنَاصِيرُ is a pl. pl., being<br>\
pl. of أَنْصَارٌ: (TA:) and ↓ نَصْرٌ is used as sing.<br>\

-b2-  الأَنْصَارُ also signifies<br>\
The Assistants of the Prophet; (M, K;) of [the<br>\
tribes of] El-Ows and El-Khazraj; (TA;) being<br>\
an epithet applied to them especially, (M, K,)<br>\
