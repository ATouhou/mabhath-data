نَخْرَبَ It (a canker-worm) pierced holes<br>\
in, or eroded, a tree. (K.) IJ derives this verb<br>\
from خَرَابٌ, (TA,) q. v.<br>\
نُخْرُوبٌ; (S, K;) mentioned in the K without<br>\
description of its measure because there is no<br>\
Arabic word of the measure فَعْلُولْ; but some<br>\
prefer it being written نَخْرُوبٌ, [as it is in the<br>\
CK,] asserting its ن to be augmentative, so that<br>\
its measure is نَفْعُولٌ, as IAar holds, asserting it<br>\
to be derived from خَرَابٌ; (TA;) A fissure, or<br>\
cleft, in a stone. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, [so in the<br>\
TA: in the CK and a MS. copy, or,] A hole,<br>\
perforation, or bore, in anything. (K.) Pl.<br>\
نَخَارِيبُ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, the pl., The holes, or<br>\
cells, prepared with wax for the bees to deposit<br>\
their honey therein: (K:) holes like the cells of<br>\
wasps. (L.)<br>\
نَخْرَبُوتٌ [i. q. تَخْرَبُوتٌ] An excellent, nimble, or<br>\
agile, she-camel. Some say that its ن is augmentative, and its radical letters are خرب; but<br>\
its derivation from خَرَابٌ is not apparent; therefore its ن should be considered as radical.<br>\
(AHei.)<br>\
شَجَرَةٌ مُنَخْرِبَةٌ, and مُنَخْرَبَةٌ, A tree that is old<br>\
and pierced with holes. (K.)<br>\
