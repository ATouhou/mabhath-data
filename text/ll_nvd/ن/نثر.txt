thine intestines like as one scatters the contents<br>\
of the stomach of a ruminant beast]: said in<br>\
threatening. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  نَثَرَ وَلَدًا (tropical:)  He (a man, M)<br>\
had many children born to him. (M, K, TA.)<br>\
And نَثَرَتِ المَرْأَةُ بَطْنَهَا, (T, A, Mgh TA,) and<br>\

(a beast of carriage, M, K, and a camel, M, and<br>\
an ass, T) sneezed [app. so as to scatter the<br>\
moisture in his nostrils]: (T, M, K, TA:) or did<br>\
with his nose what is like sneezing: (T:) he (an<br>\
ass, and a sheep or goat) sneezed, and expelled<br>\
what annoyed or hurt him, from his nose: (A:)<br>\
or نَثَرَتْ she (a ewe or goat) ejected from her nose<br>\
what annoyed or hurt her. (S.) And نَثَرَ, (Fr,<br>\
T, IAth, Mgh, Msb,) aor.<br>\

نَثْرٌ (T, Mgh) [and app. نَثِيرٌ, as above], (tropical:)  He [a<br>\
man] blew his nose; ejected the mucus from his<br>\
nose; syn. امْتَخَطَ; (IAth;) as also ↓ استنثر: (S,<br>\
K, art. مخط:) and he ejected what was in his<br>\
nose, of mucus, and of that which annoyed or hurt<br>\
him, in performing the ablution termed وُضُوْء;<br>\
(Sgh, TA;) as also ↓ أَنْثَرَ, accord. to some:<br>\
(TA:) or ↓ أَنْثَرَ signifies he ejected what was in<br>\
his nose; or he emitted his breath from his nose;<br>\
or he introduced the water into his nose; as also<br>\
↓ انتثر and ↓ استنثر: (K:) but this last explanation is outweighed in authority; the form ↓ انثر<br>\
is disallowed by the leading lexicologists; and<br>\
the author of the K, in respect of this form, follows<br>\
Sgh, without due consideration: (TA:) [accord.<br>\
to the more approved opinion,) نَثَرَ signifies he<br>\
scattered what was in his nose by the breath; as<br>\
also ↓ انتثر and ↓ استنثر: (S:) or, as some of the<br>\
learned say, he snuffed up water, and then ejected<br>\
what was in it, of anything annoying or hurting,<br>\
or of mucus; as also ↓ استنثر: (IAar, T, Mgh:)<br>\
or ↓ استنثر (T, M, IAth, K) and ↓ انتثر, (K,)<br>\
he snuffed up water, and then ejected it (T, M,<br>\
IAth, K) by the breath of the nose: (T, M, K:)<br>\
accord. to some, نَثَرَ and ↓ استنثر signify he (a<br>\
person performing وُضُوْء) snuffed up water: but<br>\
others say that the latter signifies he ejected what<br>\
was in his nose, of mucus &amp;c.; agreeably with<br>\
a trad. to be cited below: (Msb:) IAar says,<br>\
that ↓ استنثر signifies he snuffed up water, and put<br>\
in motion the نَثْرَة, or end of the nose, in purification: (T [in the Mgh, this explanation is ascribed<br>\
to Fr:]) and Fr, that نَثَرَ and ↓ انتثر and ↓ استنثر<br>\
signify he put in motion the نَثْرَة, in purification.<br>\
(T.) It is said of Mohammad, كَانَ يَسْتَنْشِقُ ثَلَاثًا<br>\
فِى كُلِّ مَرَّةٍ يَسْتَنْثِرُ [He used to snuff up water<br>\
three times, every time ejecting it; &amp;c.] and this<br>\
indicates that ↓ استنثر differs from استنشق. (T,<br>\
Mgh, Msb.) And it is said in a trad., إِذَا<br>\
اسْتَنْشَقْتَ فَانْثُرْ, (S, Msb,) and فَانْثِرْ, with the<br>\
conjunctive ا, and with damm and kesr to the ث,<br>\
(Msb,) When thou snuffest up water, scatter what is<br>\
in thy nose by the breath; (S;) or eject what is in<br>\
thy nose, of mucus, &amp;c.: (Msb:) or, as A&#39;Obeyd<br>\
relates it, ↓ فَأَنْثِرْ; inf. n. إِنْثَارٌ: (Msb:) or, as<br>\
he relates it إِذَا تَوَضَّاتَ فَأَنْثِرْ, with the disjunctive<br>\
ا; and he does not explain it; but the lexicologists do not allow ↓ أَنْثَرَ, from الإِنْثَارُ; one only<br>\
says, نَثَرَ and ↓ انتثر and ↓ استنثر. (T.) No<br>\
instance of ↓ استنثر used transitively has been<br>\
heard, except in a trad. of El-Hasan Ibn-&#39;Alee,<br>\
أَنْفَهُ ↓ اِسْتَنْثَرَ [He ejected the contents of his nose;<br>\
or he blew his nose]; as though the root [نَثَرَ]<br>\
were regarded in it, or as though it were made to<br>\
import the meaning of نَقَّى. (Mgh.)<br>\
