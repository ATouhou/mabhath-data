نَظَرَ إِلَيْهِ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) and نَظَرَهُ, (M,<br>\
A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
نَظُرَ, (M, A, &amp;c.,) and أَنْطُورٌ is<br>\
substituted for أَنْظُرُ in the dial. of certain Arabs,<br>\
(IDrd, TS, K,) or, accord. to Lb, in the Bughyetel-Ámál, the و is here added only [by poetic<br>\
license,] to make the sound of the dammeh full,<br>\
agreeably with other instances; (TA;) and<br>\
نَظِرَ إِلَيْهِ, and نَظِرَهُ, aor.<br>\
نَظَرَ, (A, K,) the verb being<br>\
like سَمِعَ accord. to the correct copies of the K,<br>\
[and so in the A,] but in one copy of the K, like<br>\
ضَرَبَ; (TA;) inf. n. نَظَرٌ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,)<br>\
and نَظْرٌ is allowable, as a contraction of the<br>\
former, (Lth,) and نَظَرَانٌ (S, K,) and مَنْظَرٌ (M,<br>\
A, K) and مَنْظَرَةٌ and تَنْظارٌ, (M, K,) [which last<br>\
is an intensive form; He looked at, or towards,<br>\
in order to see, him, or it;] he considered, or<br>\
viewed, him or it with his eye; (S, A, K;) with<br>\
the sight of the eye; (Msb;) [i. e. looked at him<br>\
or it;] as also ↓ تنظّرهُ: (K:) and ↓ انتظرهُ signifies the same as تنظّرهُ and نَظَرَهُ [but app. in<br>\
another sense, to be mentioned below, and not in<br>\
the sense explained above, though the latter is<br>\
implied in the TA; and the same may be meant<br>\
when it is said that ↓ تنظّر is syn. with نَظَرَ, if this<br>\
assertion, which I find in the M, have been copied<br>\
without consideration, and be not confirmed by<br>\
an example]: (TA:) or نَظَرَ إِلَيْهِ signifies he<br>\
extended, or stretched, or raised, [or directed,] his<br>\
sight towards him or it, whether he saw him or<br>\
did not see him. (TA.) The usage of النَّظَرٌ as<br>\
relating to the sight is most common with the<br>\
vulgar, but not with persons of distinction, who use<br>\
it more in another sense, to be explained below.<br>\
(TA.) You say, نَظَرَ إِلَيْهِ نَظْرَةً حُلْوَةً [He looked<br>\
at him, or towards him, with one sweet look.]<br>\
(A.) And نَظَرَ فِى المِنْظَارِ [He looked in the<br>\
mirror]. (A.) And نَظَرَ فِى الكِتَابِ [He looked<br>\
into, or inspected, the writing or book], (A, Msb,)<br>\
which is for نَظَرَ المَكْتُوبَ فِى الكِتَابِ [he looked<br>\
at what was written in the writing or book], or<br>\
has a different meaning to be explained below.<br>\
(Msb.) And هُوَ يَنْظُرُ حَوْلَهُ [lit., He looks around<br>\
him; meaning,] he looks much. (A.) [See also<br>\
نَظَرٌ below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  نَظَرَتِ الأَرْضُ, (Sgh, K,) and<br>\
نَظَرَتِ الأَرْضُ بِعَيْنٍ, and بِعَيْنَيْنِ, (A,) (tropical:)  The earth,<br>\
or land, showed (A, Sgh, K) to the eye (Sgh, K)<br>\
its plants or herbage. (A, Sgh, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  نَظَرَ إِلَيْهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  It looked towards, meaning faced, him or it.<br>\
So in the Kur, [vii. 197,] وَتَرَاهُمْ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَيْكَ وَهُمْ<br>\
لَا يُبْصِرُونَ (tropical:)  Thou seest them look towards thee,<br>\
i. e., face thee, but they see not; referring to idols,<br>\
accord. to A&#39;Obeyd. (TA.) And you say,<br>\
دَارِى يَنْظُرُ إِلَى دَارِ فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  My house faces the house<br>\
of such a one. (S.) And نَظَرَ إِلَيْكَ الجَبَلُ (tropical:)  The<br>\
mountain faced thee: (A:) as in the following ex.:<br>\
إِذَا أَخَذْتَ فِى طَرِيقِ كَذَا فَنَظَرَ إِلَيْكَ الجَبَلُ فَخُذْ<br>\
عَنْ يَمِينِهِ أَوْيَسَارِهِ (tropical:)  [When thou takest such a<br>\
road, and the mountain faces thee, then take thou<br>\
the way by the right of it or the left of it.] (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence, perhaps,] نَظَرَ الدَّهْرُ إِلَى بَنِى فُلَانٍ<br>\
فَأَهْلَكَهُمْ [app. meaning, (assumed tropical:)  Fortune opposed the<br>\
sons of such a one and destroyed them]: (S [immediately following there the ex. which immediately<br>\
precedes it here:]) or نَظَرَ إِلَيْهِمُ الدَّهْرُ signifies<br>\
(tropical:)  Fortune destroyed them: (M, A:) but (says<br>\
ISd) I am not certain of this. (M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  النَّظَرُ<br>\
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The turning the mind in various<br>\
directions in order to perceive a thing [mentally],<br>\
and the seeing a thing: and sometimes it means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  the considering and investigating: [and as a<br>\
subst., speculation, or intellectual examination:]<br>\
and sometimes, (assumed tropical:)  the knowledge that results from<br>\
[speculation or] investigation. (El-Basáïr.) It<br>\
is mostly used as relating to the intellect by<br>\
persons of distinction; and as relating to the<br>\
sight, most commonly by the vulgar. (TA.)<br>\
[It is said that] when you say نَظَرْتُ إِلَيْهِ, it<br>\
means only [I looked at, or towards, him or it]<br>\
with the eye: but when you say نَظَرْتُ فِى الأَمْرِ,<br>\
it may mean [(assumed tropical:)  I looked into, inspected, examined,<br>\
or investigated, the thing or affair] by thought<br>\
and consideration, intellectually, or with the mind:<br>\
(TA:) [this remark, however, is not altogether<br>\
correct, as may be seen from what follows: the<br>\
truth seems to be, that نَظَرَهُ and نَظَرَإِلَيْهِ may be<br>\
used in the latter of these two senses, though<br>\
نَظَرَ فِيهِ is most common in this sense.] It is said<br>\
in the Kur, [x. 101,] قُلِ انْظُرُوا مَا ذَا فِى السَّمٰوَاتِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Say, Consider ye what is in the heavens. (TA.)<br>\
And you say, نَظَرَ إِلَيْهِ He saw it, and (assumed tropical:)  thought<br>\
upon it, and endeavoured to understand it, or to<br>\
know its result. (TA.) [And He looked to it,<br>\
or at it, or examined it, intellectually; regarded<br>\
it; had a view to it.] And نَظَرَ فِيهِ (assumed tropical:)  He considered it: (TA:) or thought upon it; namely a<br>\
writing or book; or when such is the object it<br>\
may have another meaning, explained before;<br>\
and an affair: and with this is held to accord the<br>\
saying وَفِيهِ نَظَرٌ, q. v. infrà, voce نَظَرٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
and (tropical:)  he though upon it, measuring it, or comparing it. (M, K, TK. In the M and K, only<br>\
the inf. n., نَظَرَ فِى أَمْوَالِ الأَيْتَامِ, of the verb in this sense is mentioned.) And فَنَطَرَ نَظْرَةً فِى النُّجُومِ (assumed tropical:)  He considered, or examined, [or estimated,] the possessions<br>\
of the orphans, in order to know them. (Msb.)<br>\
And similar to this is the phrase [in the Kur,<br>\
xxxvii. 86,] النَّظَرُ, meaning, (assumed tropical:)  And<br>\
he examined the science of the stars: (Msb:) [or<br>\
he took a mental view of the stars, as if to divine<br>\
from them.] الاِعْتِبَارُ when used unrestrictedly by<br>\
those who treat of scholastic theology means<br>\
الاِعْتِبَارُ [(assumed tropical:)  The thinking upon a thing, and endeavouring to understand it, or to know its result;<br>\
or judging of what is hidden from what is apparent; or reasoning from analogy]. (MF.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  نَظَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ, inf. n. نَظَرٌ, [app. for نَظَرَ فِى مَا<br>\
بَيْنَهُمْ,] (assumed tropical:)  He judged between them. (K.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
نَظَرَتْ, (TA,) inf. n. نَظَرٌ, (assumed tropical:)  She practised divination; (K, * TA;) which is a kind of examination<br>\
with insight and skill. (TA, from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
أُنْظُرْ لِى فُلَانًا (tropical:)  [look thou out for such a one for<br>\
me;] seek thou for me such a one. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
أُنْظُرْنِى (assumed tropical:)  Listen thou to me. (M, K, TA [in the<br>\
CK, erroneously, أُنْطِرْنِى.]) The verb [says<br>\
ISd] has this meaning in the Kur, ii. 98. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b10-  أَنَا أَنْظُرُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ ثُمَّ إِلَيْكَ [lit., I look to God,<br>\
then to thee; meaning,] (tropical:)  I look for the bounty of<br>\
God, then for thy bounty. (A.) ―<br>\
-b11-  نَظَرَ اللّٰهُ إِلَيْهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  God chose him, and compassionated him, pitied<br>\
him, or regarded him with mercy; because looking<br>\
at another is indicative of love, and not doing so<br>\
is indicative of hatred: (IAth:) or (assumed tropical:)  God bestowed<br>\
benefits upon him; poured blessings, or favours,<br>\
upon him: (El-Basáïr:) and نَظَرَ لَهُمْ (tropical:)  he compassionated them, and aided them; (Sgh, K;)<br>\
and simply, he aided them: (K, * TA:) and نَظَرَ لَهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  he accomplished his want, or that which he<br>\
(another) wanted. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  نَظَرَهُ is also syn.<br>\
with ↓ إِتْنَظَرَهُ, q. v. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also syn. with أَنْظَرَهُ, q. v.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also نَظَرَهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. نَظْرٌ; (TA;) or<br>\
↓ نَظَّرَهُ; (so in a copy of the M, and in the CK;<br>\
but from the mention of the inf. n. in the TA, the<br>\
former seems to be the right reading;) He sold<br>\
it (a thing, M) with postponement of the payment;<br>\
he sold it upon credit. (M, * K, * TA.) See also<br>\
4. ―<br>\
-b4-  [In these last three acceptations, accord. to<br>\
the A, the verb is used properly, not tropically.]<br>\
-A3-  نُظِرَ He was, or became, affected by what is<br>\
termed a نَظْرَة; (K, TA;) i. e., a stroke of an<br>\
[evil] eye; (TA;) [or of an evil eye cast by a<br>\
jinnee;] or a touch, or slight taint of insanity,<br>\
from the jinn; (K;) or a swoon. (K, TA.)<br>\

-b2-  نظّر فِيهِ<br>\
[He said of it فِيهِ نَظَرٌ, q. v.]. (TA passim.)<br>\

نَاظَرَهُ فِى أَمْرٍ, inf. n. مُنَاظَرَةٌ, (T, S, *) (tropical:)  He<br>\
considered, or examined, or investigated, with him<br>\
a thing or an affair, to see how they should do it:<br>\
(T, TA:) he investigated, or examined, with him<br>\
a thing, and emulated him, or vied with him, in<br>\
doing so, each of them adducing his opinion:<br>\
(TA:) [he held a discussion with him respecting a<br>\
thing:] or نَاظَرَهُ is syn. with جَادَلَهُ: (Msb:) or<br>\
مناظرة signifies the examining mentally, or investigating, by two parties, the relation between two<br>\
things, in order to evince the truth; (KT; and<br>\
Kull, p. 342;) and sometimes with one&#39;s self;<br>\
but مجادلة signifies the disputing respecting a<br>\
question of science for the purpose of convincing<br>\
the opponent, whether what he says be wrong in<br>\
itself or not. (Kull.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also ناظرهُ [(tropical:)  He, or it,<br>\
looked towards, or faced, him, or it; was opposite,<br>\
or corresponded, to him or it. (See نَظِيرٌ.)] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
(tropical:)  He was, or became, like him: (A, K:) or like<br>\
him in discourse or dialogue. (TA.) ―<br>\

thousand. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  نَاظَرَ فُلَانًا بِفُلَانٍ (tropical:)  He made,<br>\

Ibn-Shiháb, (TA,) لَا تُنَاظِرْ بِكِتَابِ اللّٰهِ وَلَا بِكَلَامِ<br>\
رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ, i. e., Thou shalt not call anything like<br>\
the book of God, nor like the words of the apostle<br>\
of God: (A&#39;Obeyd, T, K:) or thou shalt not<br>\
compare anything, nor call anything like, to the<br>\
book of God, &amp;c.: (A,) or thou shalt not apply<br>\
[aught of] the book of God, nor the words of the<br>\
apostle of God, as a proverb to a thing that<br>\
happens: (A&#39;Obeyd, T, K; in which last, we<br>\
read لِشَىْءٍ لِغَرَضٍ, in the place of the right reading,<br>\
لِشَىْءٍ يَعْرِضُ: TA:) for, as Ibráheem En-Nakha&#39;ee<br>\
says, they used to dislike the mentioning a verse<br>\
of the Kur-án on the occasion of anything happening, of worldly events; (T;) as a person&#39;s<br>\
saying to one who has come at a time desired by<br>\
the former, (TA,) or to one named Moosà, who<br>\
has come at a time desired, (K,) جِئْتَ عَلَى قَدَرٍ يَا<br>\
مُوسَى [Thou hast come at a time appointed, O<br>\
Moosà: (Kur, xx. 42:)] (T, K:) and the like:<br>\

was not like this, but has been made like]. (T,<br>\
K:) like as you say, مَا كَانَ خَظِيرًا لَهُ وَلَقَدْ<br>\
أُخْطِرَ بِهِ. (T.)<br>\
-A2-  انظرهُ He postponed him;<br>\
delayed him: (M, A, Msb, K:) he granted him<br>\
a delay or respite; let him alone, or left him,<br>\
for a while: (T, TA:) as, for instance, a<br>\
debtor, (T, Msb, TA,) and a man in difficult<br>\
circumstances: (TA:) and ↓ نَظَرَهُ signifies the<br>\
same. (Msb.) You say, بِعْتُهُ شَيْئًا فَأَنْظَرْتُهُ I<br>\
sold to him a thing, and granted him a delay.<br>\
(T.) And a person speaking says to him who<br>\
hurries him, أَنْظِرْنى أَبْتَلِعْ رِيقِى Grant me<br>\
time to swallow my spittle. (T.) And it is said<br>\
in the Kur, [xv. 36 and xxxviii. 80,] فَأَنْظِرْنِى<br>\
إِلَى يَوْمِ يُبْعَثُونَ Then delay me until the day<br>\
when they shall be raised from the dead. (TA.)<br>\

↓ نَظَرَهُ (aor.<br>\
نَظُرَ, T &amp;c., inf. n. نَظَرٌ S, K) signifies<br>\
the same; (T, M, A, Msb, K;) and so ↓ تنظرّهُ,<br>\
(M, A, K,) and ↓ أَنْظَرَهُ; (Zj, TA;) [but respecting the last two, see what is said below:] but<br>\
when you say انتظر without any objective complement, the meaning is, [he waited; or] he<br>\
paused, and acted or behaved with deliberation,<br>\
or in a patient, or leisurely, manner. (Lth, T.)<br>\
It is said in the Kur, [lvii. 13,] اُنْظُرُونَا نَقْتبِسْ<br>\
مِنْ نُورِكُمْ Wait for us (اِنْتَظِرُونَا) that me<br>\
may take of your light: and accord. to Zj,<br>\
أَنْظِرُونَا [which is another reading] is said to<br>\
mean the same: or the latter means delay us:<br>\
accord. to Fr, however, the Arabs say أَنْظِرْنِى<br>\
meaning Wait thou for me (اِنْتَظِرْنِى) a little,<br>\
(T.) ↓ التَّنَظُّرُ also signifies The expecting, or<br>\
waiting for a thing: (TA:) or the expecting,<br>\
or waiting for, a thing expected: (M, K, TA:)<br>\
or ↓ تنظّرهُ signifies he expected, or waited for,<br>\
