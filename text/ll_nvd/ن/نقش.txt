as also ↓ انتقش: (M:) [he charactered in any<br>\
manner a coin &amp;c.:] and he engraved, agreeably<br>\

in order that the dates may ripen: (S, K:) or<br>\
and their consequently ripening. (AA.) And<br>\
one says, نُقِشَ العِذْقُ, meaning, The raceme<br>\
of dates had specks apparent in it, in consequence<br>\
of ripening. (S.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And [hence, perhaps,] نَقْشٌ<br>\

K; *) as also ↓ انتقش: (S, M, A, K:) thought<br>\

from a wound in the head: (S, K:) and he<br>\
plucked out (S, A,) hair, (A,) with the مِنْقَاش;<br>\
(S, A;) as also ↓ انتقش. (A.) A certain poet<br>\
says, (namely, Yezeed Ibn-Maksam [?] EthThakafee, O in art. شوك,)<br>\
لَا تَنْقُشَنَّ بِرِجْلِ غَيْرِكَ شَوْكَةً<br>\
فَتَقِى بِرِجْلِكَ رِجْلَ مَنْ قَدْ شَاكَهَا<br>\
[Do not thou by any means extract from the<br>\
foot of another a thorn, and so preserve, by<br>\
(risking) thy foot, the foot of him who has<br>\
pierced himself therewith]: the [former] ب is<br>\

extract from the foot of another a thorn and<br>\
put it in thy foot ?? (TA:) or مَنْ شَاكَهَا means<br>\
who has entered among the thorns. (S and O, in<br>\
art. شوك.) And it is said in a trad. of Aboo-Hureyreh, عَثَرَ فَلَا انْتَعَشَ وَشِيكَ فَلَا انْتَقَشَ [May<br>\
he stumble, and not rise again; and may he be<br>\
pierced with a thorn, and not extract the thorn]:<br>\
(M, TA: *) the words meaning an imprecation.<br>\

goats from thorns and the like, (K,) or from<br>\

(TK,) inf. n. as above, (IDrd, K,) He explored<br>\

him, or went to the utmost length with him, in<br>\
reckoning, (S, M, Msb, K,) so as to omit nothing<br>\
therein: (A &#39;Obeyd:) A &#39;Obeyd thinks that نَقْشٌ<br>\
signifying the “ extracting ” a thorn from the foot<br>\
is from this; but others say the reverse; that<br>\
the primary signification of مُنَاقَشَةٌ is the extracting a thorn from the body with difficulty; and<br>\
that it then became [conventionally regarded as]<br>\
a proper term in the sense of doing the utmost,<br>\
or going to the utmost length, in reckoning; as<br>\
observed by MF. (TA.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
مَنْ نُوقِشَ الحِسَابَ عُدِّبَ, (S,) or هَلَكَ, (M,) He<br>\
with whom the utmost is done in reckoning (S, M,)<br>\
is punished, (S,) or perishes. (M.) See also 4.<br>\
