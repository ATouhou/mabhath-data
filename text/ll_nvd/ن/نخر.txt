نَخِرٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ نَاخِرٌ (Msb, K) A bone,<br>\
(S, Msb,) and wood, (TA,) old and wasted and<br>\

whence comes, when the wind blows, a sound like<br>\
that which is termed نَخِيرٌ; [see نَخَرَ;] (TA;) a<br>\
bone into which the wind enters and whence it then<br>\
issues with the sound so termed; (S;) a bone, and<br>\
wood, in which the wind makes the sound so<br>\
termed. (A.) Of the two readings, in the Kur,<br>\
[lxxix. 11,] عِظَامًا نَاخِرَةً and عِظَامًا نَخِرَةً, Fr<br>\
prefers the former, as agreeable in form with the<br>\
words ending the other verses; and he says that<br>\
نَاخِرَةٌ and نَخِرَةٌ are the same in meaning, like<br>\
طَامِعٌ and طَمِعٌ. (TA.)<br>\
نُخْرَةٌ (tropical:)  A vehement blowing of the wind. (S,<br>\

the part between the two nostrils: or the end, or<br>\
tip, of the nose: (K:) or, as some say, the nose<br>\

هشم نُخْرَتَهُ He broke his nose. (S, TA.)<br>\
نُخَرَةٌ: see نُخْرَةٌ.<br>\
نَاخِرٌ Making the sound termed نَخِيرٌ: see 1.<br>\

vowel of the خ, like as they say مِنْتِنٌ [for مُنْتِنٌ],<br>\
(S, Msb,) both of which words are extr., as مِفْعِلٌ<br>\
is not one of the [regular] measures, (S,) and it<br>\
is said that there is no word of this measure beside<br>\
these two, (Msb,) or ↓ مِنْخِرٌ is for ↓ مِنْخِيرٌ, and<br>\
in like manner مِنْتِنٌ is for مِنْتِينٌ, which is the<br>\
original form, (T, TA,) and ↓ مِنْخَرٌ and ↓ مُنْخُرٌ (K)<br>\
and ↓ مُنْخُورٌ, (S, Msb, K,) like عُصْفُورٌ (Msb) and<br>\
مُلْمُولٌ, (K, [in the CK, erroneously, مَلْمُول])<br>\
which last is [said to be] of the dial. of Teiyi, (Msb,)<br>\
and said to occur in a verse of Gheylán, but IB<br>\
says that the right reading is مَنْحُور, with ح, syn.<br>\
with نَحْرٌ: (Sgh, in art. نحر; and L, in the<br>\
present art.) pl. مَنَاخِرُ and مَنَاخِيرُ; (Msb;) [the<br>\
