نَفُسَ, aor.<br>\
نَفُسَ, inf. n. نَفَاسَةٌ (S, M, A, Msb,<br>\
K) and نِفَاسٌ and نَفسٌ (K) and نُفُوسٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ أَنْفَسَ, (M, A, Msb,) inf. n. إِنْفَاسٌ; (A,<br>\
Msb;) It was, or became, high in estimation, of<br>\
high account, or excellent; (M, Msb, TA;) [highly<br>\
prized; precious, or valuable;] and therefore,<br>\
(TA,) was desired with emulation, or in much<br>\
request: (S, K, TA:) and the ↓ latter verb, said<br>\
of property, it was, or became, loved, and highly<br>\
esteemed. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  نَفِسَ بِهِ, (S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
نَفَسَ, (K,) inf. n. نَفَسٌ (M) [and app. نَفْسٌ as<br>\
will be shown below] and نَفَاسَةٌ and نَفَاسِيَةٌ, which<br>\
last is extr., (M, TA,) He was, or became<br>\
avaricious, tenacious, or niggardly, of it, (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K,) because of its being in high estimation,<br>\
or excellent. (Msb.) Hence the saying in the<br>\
Kur, [xlvii. 40,] فَإِنَّمَا يَبْخَلُ عَنْ نَفْسِهِ [app.<br>\
meaning He is only avaricious from his avarice.]<br>\
(TA.) You say, نَفِسَ عَلَيْهِ بِالشَّىْءِ, (M,) or عَنْهُ<br>\
[in the place of عليه], (TA,) He was, or became,<br>\
avaricious, &amp;c., of the thing, towards him, or<br>\
withholding it from him. (M, TA.) And نَفِسَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ, (S, M, K, TA,) and بِالشَّىْءِ, (M,)<br>\
inf. n. نَفَاسَةٌ. (S, K, TA,) He was, or became,<br>\
avaricious, &amp;c., of the thing, towards him, and<br>\
thought him not worthy of it, and was not pleased<br>\
at its coming to him: (TA:) or [simply] he<br>\
thought him not worthy of it: (S, M, K;) as<br>\
also نافسهُ ↓ فِيهِ  ; of which last verb we have an<br>\
ex. in the phrase تُنَافِسُ دُنْيَا, used by a poet in<br>\
speaking of the tribe of Kureysh, meaning either<br>\
تُنَافِسُ فِى دُنْبَا [they think others not worthy of<br>\
worldly good]. or تُنَافسُ أَهْلَ دُنْيَا [they think<br>\
the possessors of worldly good unworthy thereof].<br>\
(M.) [See also 3, below.] You say also, نَفِسْتَ<br>\
عَلَىَّ بِخَيْرٍ, (A, K,) or بِخَيْرٍ قَلِيل, (S,) and نَفِسْتَ<br>\
عَلَىَّ خَيْرًا كَثِيرًا, (A,) inf. n. نَفْسٌ and نَفَاسَةٌ, (A,)<br>\
Thou enviedst me (S, A, K) good, (A, K,) or a<br>\
little good, (S,) and much good, (A.) and didst<br>\
not consider me worthy of it. (A.) And فُلَانٌ<br>\
مَا يَتَنَغَّسُ عَلَيْنَا الغَنِيمَةَ وَالظَّفَرَ [app. meaning Such<br>\
a one does not envy us the spoil and the victory.]<br>\
(A, in continuation of what here immediately<br>\
precedes.) And مَا هٰذَا النَّفَسُ What is this<br>\
envying? (A, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  نُفِسَتْ; (S, M, A, Msb,<br>\
K;) and نَفِسَتْ, (S, M, Msb, K,) as some of the<br>\
Arabs say, (Msb.) aor. ??, (Msb, K:) inf. n.<br>\
نِفَاسٌ and نِفَاسةٌ (S, M) and نَفَسٌ, (M, TA,) or<br>\
the first of these ns. is a simple subst.; (Msb;)<br>\
(tropical:)  She (a woman) brought forth; (S, M, K;) and<br>\
نُفِسَتْ وَلَدًا [she brought forth a child]: (Th, M:)<br>\
and نُفِسَتْ بِوَلَدِهَا [she brought forth her child].<br>\
(A.) You say also, وَرِث فُلَانٌ هٰذَا قَبْلَ أَنْ يَنْفَسَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ, meaning, Such a one inherited this before<br>\
such a one was born. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, both these<br>\
verbs, (Msb, K,) or the latter, نَفِسَتْ, only, (Az,<br>\
Mgh, TA,) or the latter is the more common,<br>\
(K.) the former, which is related on the authority<br>\
of As, not being well known, (Msb,) (tropical:)  She (a<br>\
woman) menstruated. (Az, Mgh, Msb, K.) [In<br>\
the CK, a confusion is made by the omission of a<br>\
و before the verb which explains this last signification.] This signification and that next preceding<br>\
it are from نَفْسٌ meaning “ blood. ” (Mgh.)<br>\
-A4-<br>\
نَفَسْتُهُ بِنَفْسِ (tropical:)  I smote him with an [evil or envious]<br>\
eye. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
نفّسهُ فِيهِ, or بِهِ: see 4.<br>\
-A2-  نفّس كُرْبَتَهُ, (A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K, *) and نفّس عَنْهُ كُرْبَتَهُ, (S,) inf. n.<br>\
تَنْفِيسٌ (S, Msb, K) and [quasi-inf. n.] نَفَسٌ, (K,)<br>\
(tropical:)  He (God) removed, or cleared away, his grief,<br>\
or sorrow, or anxiety: (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K *:)<br>\
and نفّس عَنْهُ signifies the same; (M, Mgh;) and<br>\
He made his circumstances ample and easy; (M,<br>\
TA;) and he (a man) eased him, or relieved him,<br>\
syn. رَفَّهَ: (S, TA:) and also, this last phrase, he<br>\
granted him a delay: the objective compliment<br>\
being omitted: and نَفِّسْنِى is used as meaning<br>\
grant thou to me a delay: or, elliptically, نَفِّسْ<br>\
كَرْبِى or غَمِّى [remove thou my grief, &amp;c.].<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence] حَرْفُ تَنْفِيسٍ, applied to the<br>\
prefix سَ [and its variants سَوْفَ &amp;c.], meaning A<br>\
particle of amplification; because changing the<br>\
aor. from the strait time which is the present, to<br>\
the ample time, which is the future. (Mughnee,<br>\
in art. س.)<br>\
-A3-  نفّس القَوْسَ (tropical:)  He cracked the bow:<br>\
(Kr. M:) [see 5:] accord. to ISh, he put (حَطَّ)<br>\
its string [upon the bow]. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
نافس فِى الشَّىْءِ, (S, K. *) inf. n. مُنَافَسَةٌ and<br>\
نِفَاسٌ, (S,) He desired the thing, [or aspired to it.]<br>\
with generous emulation; (S, K;) as also ↓ تنافس:<br>\
(K:) and نافس صَاحِبَهُ فِيهِ [he vied with his companion in desire for it]: (A:) or تنافسوا ↓ فيه CCC<br>\
signifies they desired it [or aspired to it]: (S:)<br>\
or they vied, one with another, in desiring it: or<br>\
they desired it with emulation; syn. فَراغَبَوا: (A,<br>\
TA:) [and يُنَنَافسُ فيه it is emulously desired, or<br>\
in request; or in great request:] or مُنَافَسَهٌ and<br>\
↓ تَنَافُسٌ signify the desiring to have a thing, and<br>\
to have it for himself exclusively of any other<br>\
person; from نَفِيسٌ, signifying a thing “ good, or<br>\
goodly, or excellent, in its kind: ” (TA:) and<br>\
تَنَافَسْنَا ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرَ and تنافسنا فيه we envied one<br>\
another for that thing, and strove for priority in<br>\
attaining it. (M.) See also تَفِسَ عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ,<br>\
with which نَافَسَهُ فِيهِ is syn. (M.)<br>\
4<br>\
انفس: see نَفُسَ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  انفسهُ It<br>\
(a thing, TA) pleased him, (K, TA,) and made<br>\
him desirous of it: (TA:) or became highly<br>\
esteemed by him. (IKtt.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَنْفَسَنى فِيهِ He<br>\
made me desirous of it; (S, M, A, K:) as also<br>\
تَفَّسَنِى فيه, (IAar, M, TA,) or بِهِ. (So in my<br>\
copy of the A.)<br>\
-A3-  مَا أَنْفَسَهُ How powerful is his<br>\
evil, or envious, eye! (Lh, M.)<br>\
5<br>\
تنفّس [He breathed] is said of a man and of<br>\
every animal having lungs: (S:) [or it signifies]<br>\
he drew (اِسْتَمَدَّ) breath: (M:) or [he respired,<br>\
i. e.] he drew breath with the air-passages in his<br>\
nose; to his inside, and emitted it. (Msb.) You<br>\
say also, تنفّس الصُّعَدَآءَ [He sighed: see also art.<br>\
صعد]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  He (a man) emitted wind from<br>\
beneath him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (TA,) or تنفّس<br>\
فِى الإِنَآءِ, (K,) (tropical:)  He drank (K, TA) from the<br>\
vessel (TA) with three restings between draughts,<br>\
and separated the vessel from his mouth at every<br>\
such resting: (K, TA.) and, contr., the latter<br>\
phrase, (assumed tropical:)  he drank [from the vessel] without<br>\
separating it from his mouth: (K, TA:) which<br>\
latter mode of drinking is disapproved. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Also تنفّس (assumed tropical:)  He lengthened in speech; he spoke<br>\
long; for when a speaker takes breath, it is easy<br>\
to him to lengthen his speech; and تنفس فِى<br>\
الكَلَامِ signifies the same. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (tropical:)  It (said<br>\
of the day, M, A, and of the dawn, A, and of<br>\
other things, M) became extended; (M;) it<br>\
became long; (M, A;) or, said of the day, accord.<br>\
to Lh, it advanced so that it became noon: (M:)<br>\
or it increased: (S:) and it extended far: and<br>\
hence it is said of life, meaning either it became<br>\
protracted, and extended far, or it became ample:<br>\
(M:) and, said of the dawn, it shone forth, (Akh,<br>\
S, K, TA,) and extended so that it became clear<br>\
day: (Fr, TA:) or it broke, so that things became<br>\
plain in consequence of it: (TA:) or it rose:<br>\
(Mujáhid:) or its dusty hue shone at the approach<br>\
of a gentle wind. (Bd, lxxxi. 18.) You say also,<br>\
تنفّس بِهِ العُمُرُ (tropical:)  [Life became long, or protracted,<br>\
&amp;c., with him]. (A.) And تنفّست دِجْلَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
water of the Tigris increased. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  تنفّس<br>\
المَوْجُ (tropical:)  The waves sprinkled the water. (S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  تنفّست القَوْسُ (tropical:)  The bow cracked. (S, M, K.)<br>\
It is only the stick that is not split in twain that<br>\
does so; and this is the best of bows. And تنفّس<br>\
in the same sense is said of an arrow. (M.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
[تنفّس عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ app. signifies the same as نَفِسَ<br>\
عليه الشىء, q. v.]<br>\
6<br>\
تَنَاْفَسَ see 3, throughout.<br>\
نَفْسٌ The soul; the spirit; the vital principle;<br>\
syn. رُوحٌ: (S, M, A, Msb, K:) but between<br>\
these two words is a difference [which must be<br>\
fully explained hereafter, though ISd says, that<br>\
it is not of the purpose of his book, the M, to<br>\
explain it]: (M:) in this sense it is fem.:<br>\
(Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَنْفُسٌ and [of mult.] نُفُوسٌ.<br>\
(M, Msb.) You say, خَرَجَتْ نَفْسُهُ [His soul,<br>\
or spirit, went forth]; (Aboo-Is-hák, S, M, Msb,<br>\
K;) and so جَادَتْ نَفْسُهُ. (Msb.) And a poet<br>\
says, not Aboo-Khirásh as in the S, but Hudheyfeh Ibn-Anas, (IB,)<br>\
نَجَا سَالِمٌ والنَّفْسُ مِنْهُ بِشِدْقِهِ<br>\
وَلَمْ يَنْجُ إِلَّا جَفْنَ سَيْفٍ وَمِئْزَرَا<br>\
i. e., [Sálim escaped when the soul was in the side<br>\
of his mouth; but he escaped not save] with the<br>\
scabbard of a sword and with a waist-wrapper.<br>\
(S.) In the same sense the word is used in the<br>\
saying. فِى نَفْسِ فُلَانٍ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا وَكَذَا [but<br>\
this seems rather to mean, It is in the mind of<br>\
such a one to do so and so]. (Aboo-Is-hák, M.)<br>\
Some of the lexicologists assert the نَفْس and<br>\
the رُوح to be one and the same, except that<br>\
the former is fem., and the latter [generally or<br>\
often] masc.: others say, that the latter is<br>\
that whereby is life; and the former, that<br>\
whereby is intellect, or reason; so that when<br>\
one sleeps, God takes away his نفس, but not<br>\
his روح, which is not taken save at death: and<br>\
the نَفْس is thus called because of its connexion<br>\
with the نَفَس [or breath]. (IAmb.) Or every<br>\
man has نَفْسَانِ [two souls]: (I&#39;Ab, Zj:) نَفْسُ<br>\
العَقْلِ [the soul of intellect, or reason, also called<br>\
النَّفْسُ النَّاطِقَةُ (see رُوحٌ)], whereby one discriminates, [i. e., the mind,] (I&#39;Ab,) or نَفْسُ التَّمْيِيزِ<br>\
[the soul of discrimination], which quits him<br>\
when he sleeps, so that he does not understand<br>\
thereby, God taking it away: (Zj:) and نَفْسُ<br>\
الرُّوحِ [the soul of the breath], whereby one lives,<br>\
(I&#39;Ab,) or نَفْسُ الحَيَاةِ [the soul of life], and<br>\
when this quits him, the breath quits with it;<br>\
whereas the sleeper breathes: and this is the<br>\
difference between the taking away of the نفس<br>\
of the sleeper in sleep and the taking away of<br>\
the نفس of the living [at death.] (Zj.) Much<br>\
has been said respecting the نَفْس and the رُوح;<br>\
whether they be one, or different: but the truth<br>\
is, that there is a difference between them, since<br>\
they are not always interchangeable: for it is<br>\
said in the Kur, [xv. 29 and xxxviii. 72,]<br>\
وَنَفَخْتُ فِيهِ مِنْ رُوحِى [And I have blown into<br>\
him of my spirit.]; not مِنْ نَفْسِى: and [v. 116,]<br>\
تَعْلَمُ مَا فِى نَفْسِى [to be explained hereafter];<br>\
not فِى رُوحِى, nor would this expression be well<br>\
except from Jesus: and [lviii. 9,] وَيَقُولُونَ فِى<br>\
أَنْفُسِهِمْ [And they say in their souls, or within<br>\
themselves]: for which it would not be well to<br>\
say فِى أَرْوَاحِهِمْ: and [xxxix. 57,] أَنْ تَقُولَ نَفْسٌ<br>\
[That a soul shall say]; for which no Arab<br>\
would say أَنْ تَقُولَ رُوحٌ: hence, the difference<br>\
between them depends upon the considerations<br>\
of relation: and this is indicated by a trad., in<br>\
which it is said that God created Adam, and<br>\
put into him a نَفْس and a رُوح; and that from<br>\
the latter was his quality of abstaining from<br>\
unlawful and indecorous things, and his understanding, and his clemency, or forbearance, and<br>\
his liberality, and his fidelity; and from the<br>\
former, [which is also called النَّفْسُ الأَمَّارَةُ, q. v.,<br>\
in art. أمر,] his appetence, and his unsteadiness,<br>\
and his hastiness of disposition, and his anger:<br>\
therefore one should not say that نَفْسٌ is the<br>\
same as رُوحٌ absolutely, without restriction, nor<br>\
رُوحٌ the same as نَفْس. (R.) The Arabs also<br>\
make the discriminative نَفْس to be two; because<br>\
it sometimes commands the man to do a thing or<br>\
forbids him to do it; and this is on the occasion<br>\
of setting about an affair that is disliked: therefore they make that which commands him to<br>\
be a نفس, and that which forbids him to be as<br>\
though it were another نفس: and hence the<br>\
saying, mentioned by Z, فُلَانٌ يُؤَامِرُ نَفْسَيْهِ (tropical:)  [Such<br>\
a one consults his two souls, or minds]; said of a<br>\
man when two opinions occur to him. (TA.)<br>\
[بِنَفْسِى فُلَانٌ is an elliptical phrase sometimes<br>\
used, for بِنَفْسِى فُلَانٌ مَفْدِىٌّ, which see in art.<br>\
فدى.] ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A thing&#39;s self; (S, M, A, K, TA;)<br>\
used as a corroborative; (S, TA;) its whole,<br>\
(Aboo-Is-hák, M, TA,) and essential constituent:<br>\
(Aboo-Is-hák, M, A, K, TA:) pl. as above,<br>\
أَنْفُسٌ and نُفُوسٌ. (M.) You say, رَأَيْتُ فُلَانًا نَفْسَهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I saw such a one himself, (S,) and جَآءَنِى بِنَفْسِهِ<br>\
[or, more properly, حَآءَنِى هُوَ بِنَفْسِهِ (see, under<br>\
the head of بِ, a remark on that preposition<br>\
when used in a case of this kind, redundantly,)]<br>\
He came to me himself. (S, K.) And وَلِىَ<br>\
الأَمْرَ بِنَفْسِهِ [He superintended, managed, or conducted, the affair in his own person]. (K, in art.<br>\
بشر, &amp;c.) And حَدَّثَ نَفْسَهُ [He talked to himself;<br>\
soliloquized]. (Msb, in art. بلو; &amp;c.) And<br>\
قَتَلَ فُلَانٌ نَفْسَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one killed himself]:<br>\
and أَهْلَكَ نَفْسَهُ (assumed tropical:)  made his whole self to fall into<br>\
destruction. (Aboo-Is-hák, M.) And hence,<br>\
(TA,) from نَفْسُ الشَّىْءِ signifying ذَاتُهُ, (M,)<br>\
the saying mentioned by Sb, نَزَلْتُ بِنَفْسِ الجَبَلِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [I alighted in the mountain itself]: and نَفْسُ<br>\
الجَبَلِ مُقَابِلِى (assumed tropical:)  [The mountain itself is facing<br>\
me]. (M, TA.) [Hence also the phrase] فِى<br>\
نَفْسِ الأَمْرِ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  in reality; in the thing<br>\
itself]: as in the saying, قَلَّلَهُ فِى نَفْسِهِ وَإِنْ لَمْ<br>\
يَكُنْ قَلِيلًا فِى نَفْسِ الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  [He held it to be little<br>\
in his mind though it was not little in reality].<br>\
(Msb, art. قل.) The words of the Kur, [v. 116,]<br>\
تَعْلَمُ مَا فِى نَفْسِى وَلَا أَعْلَمُ مَا فِى نَفْسِكَ mean<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Thou knowest what is in myself, or in my<br>\
essence, and I know not what is in thyself, or<br>\
in thine essence: (Bd, K:) or Thou knowest<br>\
what I conceal (M, Bd, Jel) in my نفس [or<br>\
mind], (Bd, Jel,) and I know not what is in<br>\
thyself, or in thine essence, nor that whereof Thou<br>\
hast the knowledge, (M.) or what Thou concealest<br>\
of the things which Thou knowest; (Bd, Jel;)<br>\
so that the interpretation is, Thou knowest what<br>\
I know, and I know not what Thou knowest:<br>\
(M:) or نفس is here syn. with عِنْد; and the<br>\
meaning is, تَعْلَمُ مَا عِنْدِى وَلَا أَعْلَمُ مَا عِنْدَكَ;<br>\
(K, * TA;) [i. e., Thou knowest what is in my<br>\
particular place of being, and I know not what<br>\
is in thy particular place of being; for] the<br>\
adverbiality in this instance is that of مَكَانَة, not<br>\
of مَكَان: (TA:) but the best explanation is<br>\
that of IAmb, who says that نفس is here syn.<br>\
with غَيْب; so that the meaning is, Thou knowest<br>\
غَيْبِى [my hidden things, or what is hidden from<br>\
me, and I know not thy hidden things, or what<br>\
Thou hidest]; and the correctness of this is<br>\
testified by the concluding words of the verse,<br>\
إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ عَلَّامُ الغُيُوبِ [for Thou art he who well<br>\
knoweth the hidden things]: (TA:) [and here<br>\
it must be remarked that] العَيْبُ, which occurs<br>\
afterwards in the K as one of the significations<br>\
of النَّفْسُ, is a mistake for الغَيْبُ, the word used<br>\
by IAmb in explaining the above verse. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A person; a being; an individual; syn.<br>\
شَخْصٌ; (Msb;) a man, (Sb, S, M, TA,)<br>\
altogether, his soul and his body; (TA;) a living<br>\
being, altogether. (Mgh, Msb.) In this sense<br>\
of شخص it is masc.: (Msb:) or, accord to Lh,<br>\
the Arabs said, رَأَيْتُ نَفْسًا وَاحِدَةً (assumed tropical:)  [I saw one<br>\
person], making it fem.; and in like manner,<br>\
رَأَيْتُ نَفْسَيْنِ ثِنْتَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  [I saw two persons]; but<br>\
they said, رَأَيْتُ ثَلَاثَةَ أَنْفُسٍ (assumed tropical:)  [I saw three<br>\
persons], and so all the succeeding numbers,<br>\
making it masc.: but, he says, it is allowable<br>\
to make it masc. in the sing. and dual., and fem.<br>\
in the pl.: and all this, he says, is related on the<br>\
authority of Ks: (M:) Sb says, (M.) they said<br>\
ثَلَاثَةُ أَنْفُسٍ, (S, M,) making it masc., (S,) because<br>\
they mean by نفس “ a man,” (S, M,) as is<br>\
shown also by their saying نَفْسٌ وَاحِدٌ: (M:)<br>\
but Yoo asserts of Ru-beh, that he said ثَلَاثُ<br>\
أَنْفُسٍ, making نفس fem., like as you say ثَلَاثُ<br>\
أَعْيُنٍ, meaning, of men; and ثَلَاثَةُ أَشْخُصٍ,<br>\
meaning, of women: and it is said in the Kur,<br>\
[iv. l, &amp;c.,] اَلَّذِى خَلَقَكُمْ مِنْ نَفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [who<br>\
created you from one man], meaning, Adam.<br>\
(M.) You also say, مَا رَأَيْتُ ثَمَّ نَفْسًا (assumed tropical:)  I saw<br>\
not there any one. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  A brother: (IKh,<br>\
IB:) a copartner in religion and relationship:<br>\
(Bd, xxiv. 61:) a copartner in faith and religion.<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Arafeh.) (assumed tropical:)  It is said in the Kur, [xxiv. 61,]<br>\
فَإِذَا دَخَلْتُمْ بُيُوتًا فَسَلِّمُوا عَلَى أَنْفُسِكُمْ And<br>\
when ye enter houses, salute ye your brethren:<br>\
(IB:) or your copartners in religion and relationship. (Bd.) And in verse 12 of the same chapter.<br>\
بِأَنْفُسِهِمْ means (assumed tropical:)  Of their copartners in faith and<br>\
religion. (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (tropical:)  Blood: (S, M, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K:) [or the life-blood: in this sense,<br>\
fem.:] pl. [of pauc. أَنْفُسٌ and of mult.] نُفُوسٌ: (IB:)<br>\
so called [because the animal soul was believed<br>\
by the Arabs, as it was by many others in<br>\
ancient times, (see Gen. ix. 4, and Aristotle, De<br>\
Anim. i. 2, and Virgil&#39;s Æn. ix. 349.) to diffuse<br>\
itself throughout the body by means of the<br>\
arteries: or] because the نَفْس [in its proper<br>\

after time]. (S.)<br>\

breathing draws back into the inside, so that its<br>\
heat becomes cooled and moderated: or from<br>\
