year and did not bring forth: (S, K:) was<br>\
pregnant, and exceeded the year, counting from<br>\
the time when she conceived, and did not bring<br>\
forth. (As.) Th uses the expression نضّجت<br>\
ولدها as signifying She (a woman) exceeded the<br>\
usual period of gestation, namely nine months;<br>\
or did so by a month: in which case the child is<br>\
more strong for the delay. (TA.) ―<br>\

أَنْضَجَهُ البَرْدُ [meaning, a plant, or herbage, that<br>\
is nipped, shrunk, shrivelled, or blasted, by the<br>\

of heat; not of cold. (M.) [See أَحْرَقَ.] ―<br>\
