thee a sincere adviser]: (TA:) and إِنْتَصِحٌ<br>\

says, that the verb in this sense is intrans.; and<br>\
that, when trans., it signifies He took a person<br>\
as a نَصِيح [a sincere or faithful adviser or<br>\
counsellor, &amp;c.]; whence the saying لَا أُرِيدُ مِنْكَ<br>\
نُصْحًا وَلَا انْتِصَاحا, i. e. لَا أُرِيدُ مِنْكَ أَنْ تَنْصَحَنِى<br>\

نِصَاحَةٌ: (K:) the kesreh and ا in the latter are<br>\

added as a fem. sign of the pl. (TA.) [See<br>\
also خَيْطٌ.]<br>\
نِصَاحَاتٌ Skins. (S, K.) As cites as an ex<br>\
this verse of El-Aasha,<br>\
فَتَرَى القَوْمَ نَشَاوَى كُلَّهُمْ<br>\
مِثْلَمَا مُدَّتْ نِصَاحَاتُ الرُّبَحْ<br>\
(S, &amp;c.) ربح here signifies, accord. to some, a<br>\

animals being attached to one of the cords to<br>\
attract others. (TA.) Agreeably with this signification some explain the verse of El-Aasha cited<br>\
above; رُبَحٌ, originally رُبَاحٌ, signifying apes.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
تَوْبَةٌ نَصُوحٌ (tropical:)  True, or sincere, repentance: (S,<br>\
K:) from نَصَحَتِ الإِبِلُ الشُّرْبَ: (IAar, S:) or<br>\

الثَّوْبَ, agreeably with the saying of Mohammad,<br>\
“ He who traduces the absent rends, and he who<br>\
begs forgiveness of God mends: ” [see رَفَأَ:] (S:)<br>\
or such repentance that one returns not after it to<br>\
that of which he repents: (K:) sincere repentance, after which one returns not to sin: so<br>\
explained by Mohammad himself: (TA:) or<br>\
very sincere, or very honest repentance: (Zj:)<br>\
فَعُولٌ being a measure of an intensive epithet,<br>\
applicable alike to the masc. and fem.: (TA:)<br>\
or repentance in which one does not purpose to<br>\
return (K) to the sin of which he repents. (TA.)<br>\
