The land brought, or led him: (S, L:) [accord.<br>\
to Golius, The land brought, or produced, it: but<br>\
it is a phrase well known to the learned among<br>\
the Arabs in the present day, as similar to نَادَاهُ<br>\
تُرَابُهُ “ his dust, or earth, (i. e. the place of his<br>\
burial,) called him: ” and the explanation which I<br>\
have given is confirmed by the citation, in the S,<br>\
of the following verse, of Hanash Ibn-Málik,<br>\
immediately after نبأت به in the sense of جاءت به:]<br>\
فَنَفْسَكَ أَحْرِزْ فَإِنَّ الحُتُو<br>\
فَ يَنْبَأْنَ بِالمَرْءِ فِى كُلِّ وَادْ<br>\
[Then take good care of thyself; for deaths (of<br>\

4<br>\
انبأهُ إِيَّاهُ, and بِهِ, (and عَنْهُ, S, K, art.<br>\
كود;) and ↓ نبّأهُ (S, * K) and ↓ نَبَأَهُ, (S, * TA,)<br>\
each followed by ايّاه or به; (TA;) He informed<br>\
him, or told him, of it: (K:) or these verbs,<br>\
followed by ايّاه, signify he made him to know it;<br>\
and followed by به, he informed him, or told him,<br>\
of it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Es-Semeen says, that انبأ and<br>\
نبّأ and اخبر and خبّر, when they convey the<br>\
meaning of knowledge, are triply transitive, or<br>\
may govern three objective complements, the<br>\
greatest number that any verb can govern: (TA:)<br>\
[ex. أَنْبَأْتُ زَيْدًا عَمْرًا قَائِمًا I acquainted Zeyd that<br>\
&#39;Amr was standing]. ―<br>\
-b3-  It is also said, that ↓ نبّأ<br>\
has a more intensive signification than انبأ: ex.<br>\
مَنْ أَنْبَأَكَ هٰذَا قَالَ نَبَّأَنِى العَلِيمُ الخَبِيرُ [Who<br>\
hath acquainted thee with this? He said, The<br>\
Knowing, the Intelligent (God), hath apprized me:<br>\
Kur, lxvi. 3]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Sb has mentioned أَنَا<br>\
أَنَبُؤُكَ [for انا أَنْبَؤُكَ] as used for the sake of<br>\
conformity in sound with a preceding word.<br>\
(M, TA.) [See art. جوأ.]<br>\
-A2-  رَمَى فَأَنْبَأَ He cast,<br>\
or shot, but did not split, or cleave, or make a<br>\
slight cut, or scratch: (S, K:) or, did not penetrate. (K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تنبّأ, (S, K,) said to have been pronounced<br>\
with ء universally; (Sb, S;) but in the L, تنبّى;<br>\
(TA;) He arrogated to himself the gift of prophecy, or office of a prophet. (L, K.)<br>\
10<br>\
استنبأ النَّبَأَ He sought, or searched after,<br>\
information, or news. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَيَسْتَنْبِئُونَكَ أَحَقٌّ هُوَ<br>\
(in the Kur, x. 54) means And they will ask thee<br>\
to inform them, [saying,] Is it true? (Bd.)<br>\
نَبَأٌ Information; a piece of information; intelligence; an announcement; news; tidings; a piece of<br>\
news; an account; a narrative, or narration; a<br>\
story: or what is related from another or others: syn.<br>\
خَبَرٌ: (S, Msb, K:) it is generally held to be syn.<br>\
with خَبَرٌ; but accord. to Er-Rághib, signifies<br>\
an announcement of great utility, from which results either knowledge or a predominance of opinion,<br>\
and true: (TA:) pl. أَنْبَآءُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  النَّبَأُ العَظِيمُ<br>\
[Kur, lxxviii. 2,] accord. to some, The Kur-án:<br>\
others say, the resurrection: and others, the case<br>\
of the Prophet. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  الأَنْبَآءُ, in the Kur,<br>\
xxviii. 66, (فَعَمِيَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الأَنْبَآءُ) signifies The<br>\
allegations, pleas, or excuses. (TA.)<br>\
نَبْأَةٌ An eminence, or protuberance, in the earth,<br>\
or ground. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَبْأَةٌ A low voice, or sound:<br>\
(S, K:) or the cry, or barking, of dogs. (K.)<br>\
نَبِىْءٌ, (S, K,) pronounced with ء in the dial.<br>\
of the people of Mekkeh, (S,) whose pronunciation of it is disapproved by Sb on account of its<br>\
uncommonness; (TA;) by others, نَبِىٌّ, without ء;<br>\
(S, K, TA;) A prophet: (TA:) of the measure<br>\
فَعِيلٌ used in the sense of the measure مُفْعل [i. e.<br>\
مُفْعِلٌ or مَفْعَلٌ] (IB) or فَاعِلٌ (S, Es-Sunoosee)<br>\
or مَفْعُولٌ; (Es-Sunoosee) i. e., who acquaints or<br>\
informs mankind, (S, K, TA,) or who is acquainted<br>\
or informed, respecting God and things unseen:<br>\
or accord. to some, it is derived from نَبْوَةٌ and<br>\
نَبَاوَةٌ signifying “ elevation; ” (see art. نبو;)<br>\
in which case it is originally without ء: or,<br>\
accord. to others, from نَبِىْءٌ in a sense given<br>\
below; that of “ a conspicuous way. ” (TA.)<br>\
It is a less special word than رَسُولٌ [when thereby<br>\
is meant an apostle of God]; for every رسول is<br>\
a نبىّ, but not every نبىّ is a رسول. (TA.) Pl.<br>\
أَنْبِيَآءُ (S, K, without ء, because the ء is changed into<br>\
ى in the sing., S,) and نُبَأءُ (S, K, like كُرَمَآءُ [pl. of<br>\
كَرِيمٌ] TA,) and أَنْبَآءٌ [K, these two preserving<br>\
the original radical ء] and نَبِيُّونَ, (K,) without ء:<br>\
(TA:) but some pronounced the first and last of<br>\
these pls., in the Kur-án, with ء; though the<br>\
more approved pronunciation is without ء. (TA.)<br>\
The dim. is نُبَيّئٌ, (S, K,) with those who make<br>\
the pl. نُبَأءٌ [or أَنْبَآءٌ]; but with those who make<br>\
the pl. أَنْبِيَآء, it is نُبَىٌّ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  An Arab of<br>\
the desert said to Mohammad, يَا نَبِىْءَ اللّٰهِ, and<br>\
the latter disapproved of his pronouncing نبىء in<br>\
this case with ء, because, as it signifies An emigrant, he meant thereby to call him an emigrant<br>\
from Mekkeh to El-Medeeneh. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
نَبِىْءٌ A conspicuous, an evident, or a clear, way.<br>\
(K.) Hence, accord. to some, the apostle [or<br>\
rather prophet] is so called, because he is the<br>\
conspicuous, evident, way, that conducts to God.<br>\
(MF.) ―<br>\
-b4-  نَبِىْءٌ and ↓ نَابِئٌ An elevated, or a<br>\
protuberant, or gibbous, place. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Hence<br>\
it is said in a trad., لَا تُصَلُّوا عَلَى النَّبِىْءِ [Pray<br>\
not upon the place that is elevated, or protuberant]. (K.)<br>\
نُبُوْءَةٌ, (K, in the CK نُبُوَّة) in which the ء is<br>\
sometimes softened in pronunciation, and sometimes [or rather generally] changed into و which<br>\
is incorporated into the preceding و so that the<br>\
word is written and pronounced نُبُوَّةٌ, (TA,)<br>\
Prophecy; the gift of prophecy; the office, or<br>\
function, of a prophet. (MA, K.) Dim. نُبَيِّئَةٌ.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
نَابِئٌ act. part. n. of نَبَأَ. ―<br>\
-b2-  A bull [app. a<br>\
ثَوْرٌ وَحْشِىٌّ] that goes forth from one land or<br>\
country to another. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A torrent that<br>\
comes forth from another land or tract. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
A man coming forth unexpectedly from an unknown quarter. (S, A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [See also نَبِىْءٌ.]<br>\
هَلْ عِنْدَكُمْ نَابِئَةُ خَبَرٍ, i. q. جَائِبَةُ خَبَرٍ, [Have<br>\
ye any current news? or — news from a distant<br>\
place? &amp;c.: see جائبة]. (A.)<br>\
