نَابَهُ, aor. يَنِيبُ, He hit him on his ناب,<br>\
i. e., his canine tooth. (S, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
نيّب السَّهْمَ He bit the wood of the arrow,<br>\
to know whether it were strong or weak, and<br>\
made an impression upon it with his canine tooth.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نيّب فِيهِ He (a beast of prey) made<br>\
an impression upon him with his canine tooth:<br>\
he fixed his canine teeth in him. (TA) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
نيّبت She (a camel) became extremely old:<br>\
(Lh, S, K:) became what is termed a ناب.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  نيّب and ↓ تنيّب (assumed tropical:)  It (a plant) put<br>\
forth its root. (K.) Also signifying the same<br>\
with reference to white, or hoary hair. The<br>\
root is thought by ISd to be thus likened to a<br>\
canine tooth. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  ظَفَّر فُلَانٌ فِى كَذَا وَنَيَّبَ<br>\
(tropical:)  Such a one clung to, caught to, or took fast<br>\
hold upon, such a thing: [lit., stuck his nails and<br>\
dog-teeth into it]. (A.) See also ظَفَّرَ.<br>\
5<br>\
تَنَيَّبَ see 2.<br>\
نَابٌ [originally نَيَبٌ, The canine tooth, or<br>\
dog-tooth; or eye-tooth; the tusk, or tush; or<br>\
the fang; of certain animals:] one of the teeth;<br>\
(S;) the tooth that is [next] behind the رَبَاعِيَة,<br>\
[or next but one to the central pair of incisors:]<br>\
(M, K.) [In this sense, the word is masc.:]<br>\
the tooth thus called is mase., when thus called:<br>\
[though if you call it سِنٌّ (???)] but ناب<br>\
when fem. signifies “ an old she-camel ”<br>\
(Msb:) or, accord. to the M and K, it is fem.<br>\
only in each of the above senses without<br>\
distinction. (TA.) Sb says, that the Arabs<br>\
observed the pronunciation termed imáleh (إِمَالَة)<br>\
in the case of ناب in the nom. [as well as in<br>\
the acc. and gen., in which latter case this<br>\
pronunciation is agreeable with analogy on<br>\
account of the final kesreh,] likening its (tropical:)  to that<br>\
in رَمَى, [in which it is expressed in writing by<br>\
ى,] because it is changed from ى: but this is<br>\
extr. That is, this pronunciation of (tropical:)  changed<br>\
from ى or و is only observed [regularly] when<br>\
the said ا is a final radical letter; and specially<br>\
in verbs: the instances of this kind that occur<br>\
in nouns are extr.; and more (???) are these in<br>\
which the ا changed from ى is a medial radical<br>\
letter. (TA.) [But the restriction to the case<br>\
of verbs is inconsistent with what is said by<br>\
Ibn-Málik and other high authorities: and so,<br>\
too, is the restriction to the case of a final<br>\
radical letter.] Pl. أَنْيُبٌ (Lh, K) and أَنْيَابٌ<br>\
[both pls. of pauc.: but the latter is used as a<br>\
pl. of mult.:] and نُيُوبٌ; (S, K;) the latter<br>\
contr. to analogy, (S,) because [نَابٌ is originally<br>\
نَيَبٌ, and] a word of the measure فَعَلٌ does not<br>\
[regularly] assume the measure فَعُولٌ in the pl.;<br>\
(TA;) to which should be added نِيُوبٌ, a dial.<br>\
var., as in the case of every pl. of the measure<br>\
فُعُولٌ of which the medial radical letter is ى:<br>\
(M, F:) and pl. pl. أَنَايِيبُ. (K, TA.) Ibn-Seenà says that no animal has both a ناب and a<br>\
horn. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَابٌ An aged she-camel: (S,<br>\
K:) not applied to a male camel: (S;) so called<br>\
because of the length of her lush; (S;) by<br>\
synedoche; the whole being called by the name<br>\
of a part: (TA:) as also ↓ نَيُوبٌ; (K;) accord.<br>\
to some copies of the K, نَيَّوبٌ; but this is a<br>\
mistake: (TA:) pl. of the former أَنْيَابٌ and<br>\
نُيُوبٌ (K) and نِيبٌ: (S, K:) or these are pls.<br>\
of both the former of sing. (K. accord. to some<br>\
copies; and TA.) Sb is of opinion that نِيبٌ is pl.<br>\
of ناب, and says that the Arabs have made it<br>\
of the measure فُعْلٌ [as it is said to be in the S,<br>\
for it is originally نُيْبٌ like as they have the<br>\
pl. of دَارٌ, disliking the sound of نُيُوبٌ, because<br>\
the ى is with dammeh, and preceded by dammeh, and followed by و. It is also said to be<br>\
pl. of ↓ نَيُوبٌ; as it is related, on the authority<br>\
of Yoo, that certain of the Arabs say صِيدٌ and<br>\
بِيضٌ, as pls. of صَيُودٌ and بَيُوضٌ, agreeably with<br>\
the dial. of those who say رُسْلٌ [instead of رُسُلٌ];<br>\
namely, the tribe of Temeem but their not<br>\
saying نُيُبٌ, like as they say صُيُدٌ and بُيُضٌ, is<br>\
an argument in favour of the opinion of Sb. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ مَا حَنَّتِ النِّيبُ [I will not do that as<br>\
long as aged she-camels yearn towards their<br>\
young ones i. e., I will never do it]. A proverb.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The dim. of نَابٌ is نُيَيْبٌ, without ة,<br>\
because ناب, as applied to an aged she-camel, is<br>\
like an epithet: (S:) or rather this formation<br>\
of the dim. without ناب is a dev. from constant<br>\
rule. (MF.) Sh says, that some of the Arabs<br>\
make the dim. of ناب to be ثُوَيْبٌ, because many<br>\
an ا such as that in ناب is changed from و: [or<br>\
rather, this is generally the case:] but this, says<br>\
Ibn-Es-Sarráj is an error on his part [who does<br>\
(???) (S.) This apparently means, that Ibn-EsSarráj accuses Sh of an error; but such is not<br>\
the case: for Sb himself says “ but this is an<br>\
error on their part; ” i. e., on the part of the<br>\
Arabs who say نويب for نييب (IB.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
نَابُ قَوْمٍ (tropical:)  The lord, master, or chief, of a people:<br>\
(S, K:) pl. أَنْيَابٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  عَضَّتْهُ أَنْيَابُ الدَّهْرِ,<br>\
and نُيُوبُهُ, [(tropical:)  The dog-teeth of fortune bit him].<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b7-  انياب are likewise met. assigned to evil,<br>\
or mischief. (TA.)<br>\
نَيُوبٌ: see نَاب.<br>\
نُيَّبٌ [as though pl. of نَائِبٌ or نَائِبَةٌ] an<br>\
epithet added to نُيُوبٌ as signifying “ canine<br>\
teeth. ” to render the signification intensive, or<br>\
energetic. (TA.)<br>\
أَنْيَبُ Having a large, or thick, canine tooth,<br>\
(K,) that does not bite a thing without breaking it. (Th.)<br>\
