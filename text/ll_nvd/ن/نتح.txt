نَتَحَ, aor.<br>\
نَتِحَ, inf. n. نَتْحٌ, He, or it, sweated.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَتَحَ, aor.<br>\
نَتِحَ, inf. n. نَتْحٌ and نُتُوحٌ, It<br>\
(a leathern vessel, or skin,) sweated, or exuded<br>\
moisture, (S, L,) as when a skin sweats with the<br>\
butter that is in it. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  نَتَحَ, aor. ??, inf. n.<br>\
نَتْحٌ and نُتُوجٌ, It (sweat) exuded (S, L, K)<br>\
from the skin, (L, K,) or from the roots of the<br>\
hair; (T, L;) and grease, from a skin; and<br>\
moisture, from the soil. (L, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And said<br>\
of moisture, It percolated: see an ex. voce<br>\
عَرِقَ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  فُلَانٌ يَنْتِحُ نَتِيحَ الحَمِيتِ (tropical:)  [Such a<br>\
one sweats like a butter-skin]: said of one who<br>\
is fat. (A.) ―<br>\
-b6-  تَنَحَتْ ذِفْرَى البَعِيرِ عَرَقًا The<br>\
camel&#39;s protuberance behind his ear dripped with<br>\
sweat, by reason of his journeying during a<br>\
vehemently hot summer-day. (L.) ―<br>\
-b7-  نَتَحَتِ<br>\
الدُمُوعُ, inf. n. نَتْحٌ, (assumed tropical:)  The tears flowed. (MF.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  نَتَحَهُ It (heat, L, K, and some other thing,<br>\
L,) made him to sweat. (L, K.) [Its aor.<br>\
seems to be يَنْتَحُ; and MF thinks that, in an<br>\
instance which follows, it may be written with ا<br>\
after the ت by poetic licence.] F observes, that<br>\
J has fallen into three errors with respect to<br>\
اِنْتَاحَ; [saying that الاِنْتِيَاحُ (in the place of<br>\
which is put, in some copies of the S, الاِنْتِتَاحُ,<br>\
as is mentioned in the TA,) is like النَّتْحُ, and<br>\
citing these words of Dhu-r-Rummeh, describing<br>\
a camel making his voice to reciprocate in the<br>\
شِقْشِقَة,<br>\
رَقْشَآءُ تَنْتَاحُ اللُّغَامَ المُزْبِدَا<br>\
first, because the root of the present art. is sound,<br>\
so that الانتياح has no place in it; secondly,<br>\
because this word has no meaning (in this art.<br>\
TA); and thirdly, because the [correct] reading<br>\
is تَمْتَاحُ, meaning “ casts forth ” the froth of the<br>\
mouth. Neither IB nor IM has animadverted<br>\
on J in this case. MF, however, observes, that<br>\
one relation of a verse &amp;c., does not impugn the<br>\
correctness of another relation that differs from<br>\
it; and that perhaps the ن of تنتاح is a substitute for م; such substitution being frequent;<br>\
[as in the case of إِنْتَتَحَ;] or that the ا is what<br>\
is termed أَلِفُ إِشْبَاعٍ, and added for the sake<br>\
of the metre. (TA.)<br>\

اِنْتَتَحَ: see اِمْتَتَحَ, in art. متح.<br>\
نَتْحٌ Sweat. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See what follows.<br>\
نُتُوحٌ The gums of trees: (S, K:) one should<br>\
not say نُتُوعٌ, (S,) as is commonly said: (TA:)<br>\
it is doubtful whether its sing. be نَتْحٌ, or of<br>\
some other form. (MF.)<br>\
نِحْىٌ نَتَّاحٌ A butter-skin that sweats much. (A.)<br>\
مِنْتَحَةٌ The podex.: or the anus: syn. إِسْتٌ.<br>\

found in sandy tracts. (L.)<br>\
مَنَاتِحُ العَرَقِ The pores through which the<br>\
sweat exudes. (S.)<br>\
