became of the colour of the نَمِر [leopard or panther], (S, K,) spots being seen in their interstices.<br>\

تنمّر [He made himself like a leopard or<br>\
panther, in diversity of colours: see also 1].<br>\
&#39;Amr Ibn-Maadee-Kerib says,<br>\
قَوْمٌ إِذَا لَبِسُوا الحَدِي<br>\
دَ تَنَمَّرُوا حَلَقًا وَقِدَّا<br>\
[A people who, when they put on armour of iron<br>\
mail,] make themselves like the leopard or panther<br>\
(نَمِر) in the diversity of colours of the iron [rings]<br>\
and the thongs. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  He made himself like<br>\
the leopard or panther (نَمِر, K, TA) in ill-nature:<br>\
(TA:) (tropical:)  he became angry; as also ↓ نَمِرَ, (M,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
نَمَرَ, inf. n. ↓ نَمَرٌ; (TA;) and ↓ نمّر: (M:) (tropical:)  he<br>\
became evil in disposition; as also ↓ نَمِرَ: (T:)<br>\
(tropical:)  he became angry and evil in disposition; as also<br>\
↓ نَمِرَ and ↓ نمّر; (IKtt, Sgh, K;) like the نَمِر:<br>\
(TA:) (tropical:)  he strained the voice in threatening:<br>\
(Sgh, K:) and تنمّر لَهُ (assumed tropical:)  he became ill-natured<br>\
and altered to him, and threatened him; because<br>\
the نَمِر is never met otherwise than angry and illnatured. (As, S, K.)<br>\
نِمْرٌ: see نَمِرٌ.<br>\
نَمِرٌ: see أَنْمَرُ, throughout. ―<br>\
-b2-  نَمِرٌ (S, A, Msb,<br>\
K, &amp;c.) and نِمْرٌ, (M, A, Msb, K,) which is a<br>\
contraction of the former, (Msb,) or a dial. form,<br>\
(TA,) [The leopard;] a certain wild beast, (S,<br>\
A, Msb, K, &amp;c.) well known, (A, K,) more malignant than the lion, (T, M, Mgh, Msb,) and<br>\
bolder, (Msb,) so called because of his نُمَر [or<br>\
spots], (M, K,) being of divers colours, (M,)<br>\
called in Persian پَلَنْكْ: (Mgh:) fem. with ة:<br>\
(S, Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَنْمُرٌ (M, K) and أَنْمَارٌ,<br>\
(M, Msb, K,) and [of mult.] نُمُورٌ, (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K,) held by Th to be pl. of نِمْرٌ, (M,) and نُمُورَةٌ<br>\
(Msb, and so in some copies of the K) and نُمُرٌ,<br>\
(S, M, K,) which occurs in poetry, and is anomalous, perhaps a contraction of نُمُورٌ, (S,) and not<br>\
mentioned by Sb, (M,) and نُمْرٌ, (M, K,) which<br>\
is the most common in occurrence, but, accord.<br>\
to Th, he who uses it makes the sing. أَنْمَرُ, (M,)<br>\
and نِمَارٌ, (M, K,) held by Th to be pl. of نِمْرٌ,<br>\
(M,) and نِمَارَةٌ. (K.) As the نَمِر is one of the<br>\
most abominable and malignant of wild beasts,<br>\
one says, لَبِسَ فُلَانٌ لِفُلَانٍ جِلْدَ النَّمِرِ, meaning,<br>\
(tropical:)  Such a one became changed, or altered, to such<br>\
a one; or met him in a morose manner: (IB:)<br>\
or became very rancourous, or malicious, towards<br>\
him. (TA.) The kings of the Arabs, when they<br>\
sat [in judgment] to slay a man, used to attire<br>\
themselves in skins of the نَمِر, and then give<br>\
orders for the slaying of him whom they desired<br>\
to slay. (IB.)<br>\

pl. نُمَرٌ. (M, K.)<br>\
نَمِرَةٌ A garment of the kind called بُرْدَة, of<br>\
wool, (S, K, TA,) striped, (TA,) worn by the<br>\
Arabs of the desert: (S, K, TA:) or a garment<br>\
of the kind called شَمْلَة, (M, K,) or كِسَآء, (A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) having white and black stripes, or<br>\
lines, (M, Mgh, Msb, K,) worn by the Arabs of<br>\
the desert: (A, Msb:) and a garment of the kind<br>\
called حِبَرَة; (M, K;) so called because of the<br>\
diversity of the colours of its stripes: (M:) or<br>\
any مئْزَر, of those worn by the Arabs of the desert,<br>\
that is a striped شَمْلَة: (IAth:) or a striped إِزَار<br>\
of wool; (TA;) pl. نِمَارٌ: (IAth, Msb:) it is an<br>\
epithet in which the quality of a subst. predominates. (TA.) It is said in a trad. of Saad,<br>\
نَبَطِىٌّ فِى حُبْوَتِهِ أَعْرَابىٌّ فِى نَمِرَتِهِ أَسَدٌ فِى تَأْمُورَتِهِ<br>\
[A Nabathean in his hubweh (a long piece of<br>\
cloth, or the like, wound round the back and legs<br>\
of a person sitting with his thighs against his<br>\
belly); an Arab of the desert in his nemireh; a<br>\
lion in his den]. (S.) ―<br>\

the beasts [app. meaning while they drink],<br>\
(زَاكٍ فِى المَاشِيَة نَامٍ, T, M,) whether sweet or not<br>\
sweet. (M.) [As زَاكٍ is coupled with نَامٍ, app.<br>\
as an explicative adjunct, in the T and M, I<br>\
think that I have here rendered it correctly:<br>\
otherwise I should have supposed it to mean,<br>\
perhaps, pure.] ―<br>\
-b2-  حَسَبٌ نَمِيرٌ, (S, M, A, K,)<br>\
and ↓ نَمِرٌ, (M, K,) (tropical:)  i. q. زَاكٍ [see above]: (S, M,<br>\
A, K:) pl. أَنْمَارٌ. (M.)<br>\

(K,) variegated like the نَمِر, (S, K, TA,) having<br>\
one spot white and another of any colour: (S,<br>\
TA:) pl. as above: (TA:) or, applied to an<br>\
ostrich, in which is blackness and whiteness: pl.<br>\
as above: (S:) and a lion in which is dust-colour<br>\
and blackness: and ↓ مُنَمَّرٌ a bird having black<br>\
spots; also sometimes applied as an epithet to a<br>\
horse such as is termed بِرْذَوْن. (TA.) Also, A<br>\
collection of clouds of the colour of the نَمِر, spots<br>\
being seen in their interstices: (S:) or having<br>\
black and white spots: (TA:) and ↓ نَمِرٌ signifies<br>\
a collection of clouds having marks like those of<br>\
the نَمِر: or small portions near together: n. un.<br>\
with ة: (M:) or ↓ نَمِرَةٌ signifies a small portion<br>\
of a cloud: and its pl. [or rather the coll. gen. n.]<br>\
is نَمِرٌ. (K.) It is said in a proverb, أَرِنِيهَا نَمِرَةً<br>\
أُرِكَهَا مَطِرَةً [Show thou it to me spotted like the<br>\
leopard, I will show it to thee raining]: (S, K:)<br>\
alluding to an event which one certainly knows<br>\
will happen when the symptoms thereof appear:<br>\
(Meyd, K, TA:) originally said by Aboo-Dhueyb El-Hudhalee: (TA:) نَمِرَة is here like خَضِرًا<br>\
in the Kur, vi. 99, for أَخْضَرَ: (Akh, S:) by rule,<br>\
it should be نَمْرَآءَ, (K, TA,) fem. of أَنْمَرُ. (TA.)<br>\

applied as an epithet to a garment of the kind<br>\
called بُرْد: and in the K, voce حَبِيرٌ, to a cloud,<br>\
or collection of clouds: in the former case, it app.<br>\
signifies striped, (see نَمِرَةٌ,) or, as in the latter<br>\
case, spotted.]<br>\
