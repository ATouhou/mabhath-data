نَعِرَ (S, K) and<br>\
نَعَرَ,<br>\
(K,) [in the Msb,<br>\
نَعُرَ, but this I suppose to be an<br>\
error in transcription,] the first of which is the<br>\
most common, (K,) or the most common when<br>\
the verb relates to a vein, accord. to Fr, as cited<br>\
by Sgh, (TA,) inf. n. نَعِيرٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and<br>\
نُعَارٌ, (A, K,) or this latter is a simple subst.,<br>\
(Msb,) and نَعْرَةٌ, (A,) [or this also is a simple<br>\
subst.,] He (a man, K, or a beast of carriage,<br>\
Msb,) uttered a sound, or noise, (S, A, Msb,<br>\
K,) with, (A, K,) or in, (S,) his خَيْشُوم [or the<br>\
innermost part of his nose]: (S, A, K:) but Az,<br>\
says, I have not heard this explanation from any<br>\
of the leading authorities. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. نَعِيرٌ, (K,) He called out, or cried out<br>\
vehemently, in war, or in some evil case. (K, *<br>\
TA.) And نَعَرَتْ, inf. n. نَعِيرٌ, She (a woman)<br>\
clamoured, and acted in a foul or immodest<br>\
manner. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  نَعَرَ العِرْقُ, (S, K,) or نَعَرَ<br>\
العِرْقُ بِالدَّمِ, (A,) aor.<br>\
نَعِرَ, (Fr, Sgh, K,) and<br>\
نَعَرَ, (S, K,) the former of which is the more<br>\
common, (Fr, Sgh,) inf. n. نَعْرٌ, (S, TA,) or<br>\
نَعِيرٌ and نُعَارٌ, (as app. implied in the K, but<br>\
perhaps not intended to be so,) (tropical:)  The vein gushed<br>\
with blood: (S, K:) or, (aor.<br>\
نَعَرَ, inf. n. نُعُورٌ and<br>\
نَعِيرٌ, TA,) made a sound by reason of the<br>\
blood coming forth: (K:) or gushed with blood,<br>\
and made a sound at the coming forth of the<br>\
blood. (A.)<br>\
نَعْرَةٌ A sound, or noise, in the خَيْشُوم [or innermost part of the nose]; (S, K;) [as also ↓ نُعَارٌ.<br>\
(See 1.)] ―<br>\
-b2-  نَعَرَاتٌ [the pl.] is also applied to<br>\
The call of the مُؤَذِّن. (S.)<br>\
نُعْرَى: see نَاعِرٌ.<br>\
نُعَارٌ: see نَعْرَةٌ.<br>\
نَعُورٌ: see نَاعِرٌ.<br>\
نَعَّارٌ and نَعَّارَةٌ: see نَاعِرٌ.<br>\
نَاعِرٌ Uttering a sound or noise [with, or in, the<br>\
خَيْشُوم, or innermost part of the nose]. (Sh.)<br>\

(A:) or, so applied, it signifies clamorous and<br>\
foul, or immodest: (K:) and ↓ إِمْرَأَةٌ غَيْرَى نَعْرَى<br>\
a [very jealous] clamorous woman; (K;) in<br>\
which phrase, نعرى may not be regarded as fem.<br>\
of نَعْرَانُ, because [epithets of the measures]<br>\
فَعْلَانُ and فَعْلَى come from verbs of the class<br>\
of فَرِحَ; not from those of the class of مَنَعَ [or<br>\
that of ضَرَبَ]. (Az, K.) ―<br>\

blood; and so ↓ نَعُورٌ: (S:) that does not cease<br>\
to flow with blood; as also ↓ نَعُورٌ (TA) and<br>\
↓ نَاعُورٌ: (K, TA:) and ↓ نَعَّارٌ applied to a<br>\
wound signifies the same; as also تَعَّارٌ, with ت<br>\
and ع, and ↓ تَغَّارٌ, with ت and غ: (IAar, Az:)<br>\
and ↓ نَعُورٌ applied to a wound signifies (tropical:)  making<br>\
