اناء الأَمْرَ He did the thing not firmly, not<br>\
soundly, not thoroughly. الامر ↓ نيّأ, accord. to<br>\
the K, signifies the same: but this is unknown,<br>\
and not authorized by transmission [from the<br>\
Arabs of the classical ages], and therefore not<br>\
mentioned by IM nor by other leading lexicographers: the correct phrases are [when the<br>\
verb is intrans.] ناء الامرُ [and اللحمُ], and [when<br>\
it is trans.] اناء اللحمَ [and الامر]: the forms<br>\
of the verb being like بَانَ and أَبَانَ. (TA.) ―<br>\

called نضيج: or milk just drawn from the udder,<br>\
