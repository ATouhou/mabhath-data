نَقَضَهُ, (M, Mgh, Msb,) aor.<br>\
نَقُضَ, (M, Msb,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. نَقْضٌ, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
He undid it; took it; or pulled it, to pieces:<br>\
untwisted it: unravelled it: unwove it: dissolved<br>\
it: broke it: or rendered it uncompact, unsound,<br>\
or unfirm,: after having made it compact, sound,<br>\
or firm: (JK, M, A, Msb, K, TA:) namely<br>\
a building, or structure: and a rope, or cord:<br>\
(S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, TA:) and silk, or flax:<br>\
(TA:) and cloth: (L:) and (tropical:)  a compact, contract, or covenant; (S, A, Msb, K, TA;) and<br>\
(assumed tropical:) a sale: (Mgh:) and (assumed tropical:)  other things; (A, K,<br>\
TA;) such as (assumed tropical:)  an affair, or a case; and (assumed tropical:)  the<br>\
state of a place through which the invasion of<br>\
an enemy is feared: (TA:) contr. of أَبْرَمَهُ, (M,<br>\
A, K, TA,) as relating to a building or structure,<br>\
and to a rope or cord, (A, K, TA,) and to a<br>\
compact or contract or covenant, &amp;c.: (K, TA:)<br>\
or i. q. حَلَّ بَرْمَهُ, as relating to a rope or<br>\
cord, and to a compact or contract or covenant:<br>\
(Msb:) or i. q. هَدَمَهُ, as relating to a building<br>\
or structure: (TA:) or the inf. n. signifies إِفْسَادُ<br>\
مَا أَبْرَمْتَ, as relating to a building or structure.<br>\
(JK, TA,) and to a rope or cord, (JK,) and to<br>\
a compact or contract or covenant. (TA.) [It<br>\
is said in the K, that النَّقْضُ is the contr. of<br>\
الإِبْرَامُ, like الإِنْتقَاضُ and التَّنَاقُضُ: but this is<br>\
a glaring mistake; and seems to be a corruption<br>\
of the following passage in the M: النَّقْضُ ضِدُّ<br>\
الإِبْرَامِ نَقَضَهُ يَنْقُضُهُ نَقْضًا وَانْتَقَضَ وَتَنَاقَضَ, which<br>\
is meant indicate that انتقض and تناقض are<br>\
quasi-passives of نَقَضَهُ: and in like manner, the<br>\
passage in the A, النَّقْضُ فِى البِنَآءِ وَالحَبْلِ وَغَيْرِهِ<br>\
ضِدُّ الإِبْرَامِ وَانْتَقَضَ وَنَتَقَّضَ, indicates that انتقض<br>\
and تنقّض are quasi-passives of نَقَضَهُ. Further.<br>\
it should be observed that نَقَضَهُ, as relating to<br>\
a building, is not well explained by هَدَمَهُ; for<br>\
you say, نَقَضَ البِنَآءَ مِنْ غَيْرِ هَدْمٍ, (mentioned<br>\
in the S and A, &amp;c., in art. قوض,) meaning He<br>\
took to pieces the building without demolishing,<br>\
or destroying.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] نَقَصَ فُلَانٌ وَتَرَهُ [lit.<br>\
Such a one undid, or untwisted, his bow-string];<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  such a one took, or had taken, his<br>\
blood-revenge. (A, TA.) And الدَّهْرُ ذُو نَقْضٍ<br>\
وَإِمْرَارٍ [lit. Time, or fortune, has a property of<br>\
untwisting and twisting tightly]; meaning (tropical:)  that<br>\
which time, or fortune, [as it were] twists tightly,<br>\
[or makes firm.] it, at another time, [as it were]<br>\
untwists, or undoes. (TA.) And نَقَضْتُ مَا أَبْرَمَهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  I annulled [what he confirmed, or made firm].<br>\
(Msb.) And يَنْقُضُ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  [He undoes, or annuls,<br>\
or contradicts, what he (another) has said]; said of<br>\
a poet replying to another poet. (Lth, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
نقض السقف, [i. e., app., نَقْضُ السَّقْفِ,] also<br>\
signifies تحريك خشبه [i. e. تَحْرِيكُ خَشَبِهِ, The<br>\
moving, or shaking, of the pieces of wood, or<br>\
rafters, of the roof]. (TA. [But perhaps the<br>\
phrase to be explained is السَّقْفُ ↓ نَقَّضَ, and the<br>\
explanation, correctly, تَحَرَّكَ خَشَبُهُ, i. e. The<br>\
pieces of wood, or rafters, of the roof moved, or<br>\
shook, (for this, I am informed, is agreeable<br>\
with modern usage,) app. so as to produce a<br>\
sound: see also 5.])<br>\

نَقَّضَ see 4, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and 5; and see 1,<br>\
next before the last break.<br>\
3<br>\
المُنَاقَضَةُ فِى القَوْلِ is (tropical:)  The saying that which<br>\
is contradictory in its meaning [or meanings; as<br>\
though one of its meanings undid, or annulled,<br>\
the other]: (S, * K, TA:) from نَقْضُ البِنَآءِ: and<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  the contending with another in words,<br>\
[or in contradiction,] each rebutting what the<br>\
other said. (TA.) You say, ناقضهُ فِى الشَّىْءِ,<br>\
inf. n. مُنَاقَضَةٌ and نِقَاضٌ, (tropical:)  He contradicted him<br>\
in, or respecting, the thing. (M, TA. *) And<br>\
قُلْتُ لَهُ نِقَاضًا (tropical:)  I contradicted him with respect to<br>\
his saying, and his satirizing of me. (M, TA.)<br>\
And ناقض أَحَدُ الشَّاعِرَيْنِ الأَخَرَ (tropical:)  [One of the two<br>\
poets contradicted the other]. (A.) And ناقض<br>\
قَوْلُهُ الثَّانِى الآوَّلَ (tropical:)  [His second saying contradicted<br>\
the first]. (A, TA.) And ناقض آخِرُ قَوْلِهِ الأَوَّلَ<br>\
(tropical:)  [The last part of his saying contradicted the<br>\
first]. (Mgh.) [See also 6.]<br>\
4<br>\
انقض الكَمْأَةَ, (M, K, TA.) and انقض عَنْهَا.<br>\
(M, TA,) He removed the crust of earth from<br>\
over the truffles: (M:) or he extracted, or took<br>\
forth, the truffles from the earth. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
انقض الكَمْءُ The crusts of earth ??? up (تَقَلْفَعَتْ)<br>\
from over the truffle; as also ↓ نَقَّضَ. (M, TA.)<br>\
[See also 5.] ―<br>\
-b2-  انقضت الأَرْضُ The earth showed<br>\
[or put forth] its plants, or herbage. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  انقض also signifies It produced, made, gave,<br>\
emitted, or uttered, a sound, noise, voice, or cry:<br>\
(S, M, K, TA:) and [particularly] a slight sound<br>\
like what is termed نَقْرٌ: (S, TA:) said of a joint<br>\
of a man, (M, K,) and of the fingers [when their<br>\
joints are made to crack], and of the ribs, (A,)<br>\
[see also 5,] and of a camel&#39;s saddle, (A, TA.,)<br>\
and of a cupping-instrument when the cupper<br>\
sucks it, (TA,) [&amp;c., (see نَقِيضٌ,)] and of an<br>\
eagle, (S, M, K,) and of a hen (S, A) on the<br>\
occasion of her laying eggs, (A,) and of a chicken,<br>\
(M, A, K,) and of an ostrich, and of a quail,<br>\
and of a hawk, and of a scorpion, and of a frog,<br>\
and of the [kind of lizard called] وَزَغ, and of the<br>\
وَبْر [or Syrian hyrax], (M, K,) and of a young<br>\
camel, the sounds of which are denoted by إِنْقَاضٌ<br>\
and كَتِيتٌ, as those of a camel advanced in age<br>\
are by قَرْقَرَةٌ and هَدِيرٌ: (S:) or إِنْقَاضٌ relates to<br>\
animate things; and ↓ نَقْضٌ, inf. n. of نَقضَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
نَقُضَ and<br>\
نَقِضَ, to inanimate things. (M, K.)<br>\
[Accord. to the A, whether said of animate things<br>\
or of inanimate, it is proper, not tropical, but<br>\
accord. to what is said in the TA voce نَقِيض, it<br>\
is properly said of animate things, and tropically of<br>\
inanimate; though, if any such distinction exist,<br>\
the reverse seems to me to be more probable.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
You say also, انقض بِالدَّابَّةِ, (K,) or بِالْحِمَارِ. (Lth,)<br>\
or, as As says, (M, TA,) بِالعَيْرِ, (M,) or بِالبَعِيرِ,<br>\
(TA,) and بِالفَرَسِ, (M, TA,) He made a sound<br>\
to the beast of carriage, (M, K,) or to the ass,<br>\
(Lth, As, M,) or to the camel, (As, TA,) and to<br>\
the horse, (As, M, TA,) at the two sides of his<br>\
tongue, after making it cleave to the roof of his<br>\
mouth, (Lth, M, K, TA,) without removing its<br>\
extremity from its place, (Lth, TA,) in order to<br>\
chide the beast: (L:) or انقض بِهِ signifies i. q.<br>\
نَقَرَ بِهِ [q. v.]; (As, M, A, TA;) the object being<br>\
a [camel such as is called] قَعُود; (A;) or whatever be the object. (As, M, TA.) And انقض<br>\
بِالْمَعْزِ, (S, Sgh, K,) or بِالعَنْزِ, (M, A,) He called<br>\
the goats, (S, Sgh, K,) or the she-goat; (M, A;)<br>\
accord. to AZ, (S, Sgh,) or Ks. (M, L.) And<br>\
انقض بِهِ He made a sound to him like as when<br>\
thou makest a smacking with the tongue to a sheep<br>\
or goat, [in the TA, كما تنقر الشاة, for which I<br>\
read كَمَا تَنْقُرُ بِالشَّاةِ,] deeming him ignorant.<br>\
(TA.) And He made a clapping to him with<br>\
one of his hands upon the other, so as to cause a<br>\
[sound such as is termed] نَقِيض to be heard.<br>\
(El-Khattábee.)<br>\
-A4-  انقض أَصَابِعَهُ (M, A, K) He<br>\
made a sound, or sounds, [app. a cracking of the<br>\
joints,] with his fingers: (M:) [and so ↓ نَقَّضَهَا,<br>\
inf. n. تَنْقِيضٌ: (see فَرْقَعَ:)] or he struck with his<br>\
fingers in order that they might make a sound, or<br>\
sounds: (K:) if it mean cracking of the joints<br>\
(فَرْقَعَة), it is disapproved; but if clapping, it is<br>\
not. (TA.) And انقض العِلْكَ He caused the<br>\
[kind of gum called] علك to make a sound, or<br>\
sounds; [i. e., in chewing it, as many women do;]<br>\
the doing of which is disapproved. (S, L, K.<br>\
[But in the S and L, it said that إِنْقَاضُ العِلْكَ<br>\
signifies تَصْوِيتُهُ, which does not necessarily indicate that the former verb is transitive.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, (S, M, TA,) انقض الحِمْلُ ظَهْرَهُ (S, M,<br>\
A, Msb, K *) The load made his back to sound by<br>\
reason of its weight: (M:) or pressed heavily<br>\
upon him, (S, M, Msb, K,) so that his back was<br>\
heard to make a sound such as is termed نَقِيض;<br>\
(M, K; * i. e. the sound of the camel&#39;s saddle when<br>\
it becomes infirm by reason of the weight of the<br>\
load; (Bd, xciv. 3;) or a slight sound, as when<br>\
a man makes a smacking with his tongue (يُنْقِضُ)<br>\
to his ass, in driving him: (TA:) or oppressed<br>\
his back by its weight: (Msb:) or rendered him<br>\
lean, or emaciated; جَعَلَهُ نِقْضًا, i. e. مَهْزُولًا. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Arafeh, K.) Thus in the phrase الَّذِى أَنْقَضَ ظَهْرَكَ,<br>\
(S, M, K,) in [xciv. 3, of] the Kur. (S, M.)<br>\
5<br>\
تنقّض: see 8. ―<br>\
-b2-  الأَرْضُ عَنِ الكَمْأَةِ<br>\
The earth clave, or cracked, or burst, from over<br>\
the truffles; (S, A, * TA;) syn. تَفَطَّرَتْ. (S,<br>\
TA.) In all the copies of the K, we find تنقّض<br>\
الدَّمُ, explained by تَقَطَّرَ; [as though meaning<br>\
The blood was made to drop, drip, or fall in<br>\
drops;] but how likely is this to be a mistranscription. (TA.) [The right reading of the<br>\
phrase is probably تنقّض الكَمْءُ; and of the explanation, تَفَطَّرَ; and if so, the phrase is like<br>\
أَنْقَضَ الكَمْءُ, and نَقَّضَ, explained above: see 4,<br>\
second sentence.] ―<br>\
-b3-  تنقّض الَبْيتُ The house, or<br>\
chamber, became cleft, or cracked, in several<br>\
places, so as to cause a sound to be heard (K,<br>\
TA.) And تنقّض is also said of a building,<br>\
[app. in the same sense,] like ↓ نَقَّضَ. (TA.)<br>\
[See نَقَّضَ السَّقْفُ, in 1, next before the last break.]<br>\
You say also, تنقّضت عِظَامُهُ (tropical:)  His bones made a<br>\
sound [app. in being broken]. (IF, K, TA.)<br>\
[See also 4.]<br>\
6<br>\
تناقض: see 8. ―<br>\
-b2-  تَنَاقُضٌ also signifies<br>\
(tropical:)  Mutual contradiction, or repugnancy; contr.<br>\
of تَوَافُقٌ. (O, TA.) You say, فِى كَلَامِهِ تَنَاقُضٌ<br>\
(A, Mgh, Msb, TA,) (tropical:)  [In his speech is contradiction, or repugnancy, between different parts;]<br>\
one part of his speech necessarily implies the<br>\
annulment of another part; (Msb;) his second<br>\
saying contradicted (نَاقَضَ) his first. (TA.)<br>\
And تَنَاقَضَ القَوْلَانِ, (A, Mgh,) or الكَلَامَانِ,<br>\
(Msb,) (tropical:)  The two saying, or sentences, contradicted each other; or were mutually repugnant;<br>\
as though each undid the other; (Msb;) [they<br>\
annulled each other.] And تناقض الشَّاعِرَانِ (tropical:)  [The<br>\
two poets contradicted each other.] (A, TA.)<br>\
And تناقض مَعْنَاهُ (tropical:)  Its meaning was contradictory.<br>\
(S, * K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [It is also used transitively:]<br>\
you say, تَنَاقَضَا البَيْعَ (assumed tropical:)  They two mutually dissolved the sale: as though compared with the<br>\
saying تَرَآءَوُا الهِلَالَ, meaning “ they [together]<br>\
saw the new moon; ” and تَدَاعَوُا القَوْمَ, meaning<br>\
“ they [together] called the people; ” and تَسَآءَلُوهُمْ,<br>\
meaning “ they [together] asked them; ” notwithstanding that تناقض is [properly] intransitive.<br>\
(Mgh.) And تَنَاقَضُوا عُهُودَهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [They mutually<br>\
dissolved, or broke, their compacts, contracts, or<br>\
covenants]. (T, voce تناكثوا.)<br>\
8<br>\
انتقض quasi-pass. of نَقَضَهُ [It became undone; taken, or pulled to pieces: untwisted:<br>\
unravelled: unwoven: dissolved; broken: or rendered uncompact, unsound, or infirm, after it had<br>\
been made compact, sound, or firm]: (M, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, TA:) as also ↓ تنقّض, (A,) and<br>\
↓ تناقض: (M, TA:) [respecting the first and<br>\
last, see a remark upon a mistake in the K, following the first sentence in 1: but انتقض afterwards occurs in the K used properly in the<br>\
phrase مَا انْتَقَضَ مِنَ البُنْيَانِ:] i. q. اِنْتَكثَ: (S:)<br>\
said of a building, or structure: and of a rope,<br>\
or cord: (A, Mgh, Msb, TA:) [and of silk, or<br>\
flax: and of cloth: (see 1:)] and (tropical:)  of a compact,<br>\
contract, or covenant: (TA:) [and of a sale:<br>\
(see 1:)] and (tropical:)  of other things. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] انتقضت القَرْحَةُ (tropical:)  The wound, or ulcer,<br>\
became recrudescent. (IF, * A.) And انتقض<br>\
الجُرْحُ بَعْدَ بُرْئِهِ (assumed tropical:)  The wound became in a bad, or<br>\
corrupt, state, after its healing. (Msb.) And<br>\
انتقض الأَمْرُ بَعْدَ الْتِئَامِهِ (A, * Msb, TA) (tropical:)  The<br>\
affair, or case, became in a bad, or unsound state,<br>\
after it had been in a sound state. (Msb.) And<br>\
انتقض أَمْرُ الثَّغْرِ بَعْدَ سَدِّهِ (assumed tropical:)  [The state of the place<br>\
through which the invasion of an enemy was feared<br>\
became unfortified, after its being fortified, or<br>\
closed]. (TA.) And انتقضت الطَّهَارَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The state<br>\
of purity became annulled. (Msb.) And انتقض<br>\
عَلَيْهِ الشِّعْرُ (tropical:)  [The poetry became undone, annulled,<br>\
or contradicted, by a reply against him: see<br>\
يَنْقُضُ عَلَيْهِ]. (A, TA.)<br>\
11<br>\
انقاضّ It (a wall) cracked, without falling<br>\
down; like إِنْقَضَّ. (K in art. قض.) See also<br>\
إِنْقَاضَ, in art. قيض.]<br>\
نُقْضٌ: see نِقْضٌ, in two places.<br>\
نِقْضٌ i. q. ↓ مَنْقُوضٌ [Undone; taken, or pulled,<br>\
to pieces: untwisted: unravelled: unwoven: dissolved; broken: &amp;c. (see 1:)] (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K:) like نِكْثٌ (S, TA) in the sense of مَنْكُوثٌ:<br>\
(TA:) as also ↓ نُقْضٌ; (Mgh, Msb;) and<br>\
↓ نَقَضٌ: (Sgh:) but El-Ghooree allows only the<br>\
first: (Mgh:) Az, however, mentions only the<br>\
second; (Msb;) which signifies as above, applied<br>\
to a building, or structure; (M, Mgh;) or what<br>\
has become taken, or pulled, to pieces, (مَا انْتَقَضَ,)<br>\
of a building, or structure; (K;) as also the<br>\
first: (TA:) or نَقْضٌ signifies مَا نَقَضْتَ what<br>\
thou hast undone; taken, or pulled, to pieces;<br>\
untwisted; &amp;c.]: (M:) and what is undone, of<br>\
[the stuff of the tents called] أَخْبِيَة, and of [the<br>\
garments called] أَكْسِيَة, and twisted a second<br>\
time; (M, K;) as also ↓ نَقَضٌ; (K;) and<br>\
↓ نُقَاضَةٌ: (L:) or this last signifies what is<br>\
undone of a hair-rope: (S, O, K:) the pl. of<br>\
نِقْضٌ is أَنْقَاضٌ [a pl. of pauc.], (M,) and of<br>\
the same, (Msb,) or of ↓ نُقْضٌ, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
نُقُوضٌ. (Mgh, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  Emaciated, or rendered lean, (S, M, K,) by travel; (S, K;) upon<br>\
which one has journeyed time after time: (O:)<br>\
Seer says, as though travel had unknit its frame;<br>\
(M, TA;) thus indicating it to be tropical:<br>\
(TA:) applied to a male camel, (S, M, K,) and<br>\
to a horse, (M.) and to a female camel, (S, K,)<br>\
or the female is termed نِقْضَةٌ: (M, K:) pl.<br>\
أَنْقَاضٌ, (Sb, S, K,) only, (Sb, M,) both of the<br>\
masc. and fem.; in the latter, the ة being<br>\
imagined to be elided; (M;) and نَقَائِضُ is<br>\
[also said to be] a pl. of نِقْضٌ signifying jaded,<br>\
applied to a she-camel. (So in a copy of the<br>\
S in art. نفص.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [See an ex. in a verse cited<br>\
voce سَدٌّ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  The place, (S,) or crust of earth,<br>\

نُقُوضٌ. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Accord. to the K, i. q.<br>\
نِفْضٌ; but the latter is a mistranscription;<br>\
(TA;) Honey that has in it [worms of the kind<br>\
called] سُوس; wherefore it is taken, (M, K in<br>\
art. نفض,) and pounded, (K, ubi supra,) and the<br>\
place of the bees is smeared (يُلَطَّخُ [in a copy<br>\
of the M يُطْبَخُ, which is doubtless a mistranscription,]) therewith, together with myrtle (آس)<br>\
and the bees then come to it, and deposit<br>\
their honey in it; (M, K, ubi supra;) on the<br>\
authority of El-Hejeree: (M:) or the dung<br>\
of bees in the place where they deposit their<br>\
honey: (IAar, AHn, K, ubi supra:) or the bees<br>\
that have died therein. (Sgh, K, ubi supra.)<br>\
-A2-  See also نَقِيضٌ.<br>\
نَقَضٌ: see نِقْضٌ, in two places.<br>\
نَقِيضٌ (tropical:)  A contradictor: applied to a man:<br>\
fem. with ة. (M, TA.) You say [also], ذَا<br>\
نقيضُ ذَاكَ (tropical:)  This is a contradictor [i. e. the contrary] of that: (A, TA:) [or this is inconsistent<br>\
with that: for] النَّقِيضَانِ لَا يَجْتَمِعَانِ وَلَا يَرْتَفِعَانِ<br>\
[what are termed نقيضان cannot be coëxistent in<br>\
the same thing, nor simultaneously nonexistent<br>\
in the same thing]; as existence itself and nonexistence, and motion and rest. (Kull, pp. 231,<br>\
232) You say also, هٰذِهِ قَصِيدَةٌ نَقِيضُ قَصِيدَةِ<br>\
فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  [This poem is a contradictor of the poem<br>\
of such a one]. (A.) And النَّقِيضَةُ in poetry is<br>\
(tropical:)  That by which one undoes or annuls or contradicts [what another poet has said]: (S:) or<br>\
نَقِيضَةُ الشِّعْرِ consists in a poet&#39;s putting forth<br>\
poetry, and another poet&#39;s undoing or annulling<br>\
or contradicting it, by putting forth what is different therefrom: (Lth, K, * TA:) the subst<br>\
is نَقِيضٌ: [or rather this seems to be an epithet<br>\
in which the quality of a subst. is predominant,<br>\
and syn. with نَقِيضَةٌ:] and the act of the two is<br>\
termed ↓ مُنَاقَضَةٌ: the pl. of نَقِيضَةٌ is نَقَائِضُ:<br>\
(TA:) you speak of the نَقَائِض of Jereer and<br>\
El-Farezdak. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  A sound, noise,<br>\
voice, or cry; (Lth, S, M, O, K:) as also<br>\
↓ نِقْضٌ accord to the K; but this is an enormous<br>\
error: (TA:) the former, of the joints (Lth,<br>\
M, K) of a man, (M,) [a meaning also assigned<br>\
to نِقْضٌ in the K,] and of the fingers, and of the<br>\
ribs, (Lth, M, A,) and of camels&#39; saddles, (S,<br>\
K,) or of a camel&#39;s saddle, (M, O, K, [but in<br>\
CK, for الرَّحْل, we find الرِّجْل, the foot,]) and of<br>\
camels&#39; litters, (S, K,) and of tanned skins, (K,)<br>\
or of a tanned skin, (M,) and of a bow-string,<br>\
(M, K,) and of نِسْع [q. v.] (O, K,) when new,<br>\
(O,) and of the sucking of a cupping-instrument;<br>\
(K;) [in all these senses said in the TA to be<br>\
tropical; but see 4;] and also the former, (S,<br>\
M, TA,) in the K, erroneously, the latter word,<br>\
(TA,) of an eagle, (S, M, K,) and of chickens,<br>\
and of an ostrich, and of a quail, and of a hawk,<br>\
