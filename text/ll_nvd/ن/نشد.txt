S, M, L, Msb, K:) and [in like manner] ↓ انشد<br>\

-b2-  Also, He made known, or gave information<br>\
of, a stray-beast, or beast that had been lost;<br>\
(Lh, A&#39;Obeyd, M, L, Msb K;) and so ↓ انشد:<br>\
(Lh, S, M, IKtt, L, Msb, K:) thus the latter<br>\
verb [as well as the former] bears two contr.<br>\
significations. (M, K.) See also نَاشِدٌ. ―<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  He sought, sought for or after, or desired, a<br>\

(aor.<br>\
نَشُدَ, T, S,) inf. n. نَشْدٌ, (tropical:)  He said to him<br>\
نَشَدْتُكَ اللّٰهَ, (S, L, K,) which signifies I conjure,<br>\

and he remembered; (S, L;) as also أَنْشُدُكَ اللّٰهَ,<br>\

signifies I adjure thee by God; as also ↓ أَنْشَدْتُكَ<br>\
بِاللّٰهِ; (M, L,) or this latter is erroneous: (Mgh,<br>\
L:) and so signifies نَشْدَكَ اللّٰهَ; (M, L, K;) in<br>\
which نَشْد is said to be originally نَشْدَة, an<br>\
inf. n. put in the place of the verb, or نشدك اللّٰه<br>\
is a phrase of unpremeditated formation, like<br>\
قَعْدَكَ اللّٰهَ and عَمْرَكَ اللّٰهَ; or this phrase, which<br>\
occurs in a trad., may be incorrectly transmitted,<br>\
and should perhaps be أَنْشُدُكَ اللّٰهَ: (IAth, L:)<br>\

[My lord is generous; he does not sully a favour:<br>\
and when he is asked, or begged, or besought, in<br>\
papers, he gives], means, accord. to AO, that En-Noamán Ibn-El-Mundhir, when asked, or begged,<br>\
