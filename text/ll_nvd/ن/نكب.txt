to Any wind that blows obliquely, taking a direction between [the directions of] two [cardinal]<br>\
winds: (TA:) a wind that blows obliquely, deviating from the direction whence blow the right<br>\
(القُوَّم [or the cardinal]) winds: (S:) or a [particular] wind that blows obliquely, and takes a<br>\
direction between [the directions of] two [cardinal]<br>\
winds; (K;) which destroys the camels and<br>\
sheep &amp;c., and restrains the rain: (TA:) or a<br>\
wind that blows in a direction between that of the<br>\
east, or easterly, wind, (الصَّبَا,) and that of the<br>\
north, or northerly, wind, (الشَّمَال): (AZ, K:)<br>\
that between the south, or southerly, and east, or<br>\
easterly, winds, being called جِرْبِيَاءُ: (AZ:) [but<br>\
see this word, and see below:] or what are<br>\
termed نُكْبُ الرِّيَاحِ [نُكْبٌ being pl. of نكباء] are<br>\
four: (IAar, Th, S, K:) namely, first, the نكباءُ<br>\
الصَّبَا وَالجَنُوبِ the wind that blows in a direction<br>\
between that of the east, or easterly, and that of<br>\
the south, or southerly, wind; also called الأَزْيَبُ;<br>\
(S, K;) which is a very thirsty wind, that dries<br>\
up much the leguminous plants; but Et-Tará-<br>\
bulusee, in the Kf, and Mbr and IF, assert that<br>\
the ازيب is the جنوب; not its نكباء: (TA:)<br>\
second, the نكباءُ الصَّبَا وَالشَّمَالِ the wind that<br>\
blows in a direction between that of the east, or<br>\
easterly, and that of the north, or northerly, wind;<br>\
also called الصَّابَيةُ, and called also ↓ النُّكَيْباَءُ, (S, K,)<br>\
a diminutive meant to convey the opposite of a<br>\
diminutive sense; for they find this wind to be<br>\
very cold; (S;) it is very boisterous and very<br>\
cold; unattended by rain or by any good: (TA:)<br>\
third, the نكباءُ الشَّمَالِ وَالدَّبُورِ the wind that blows<br>\
in a direction between that of the north, or<br>\
northerly, and that of the west, or westerly, wind;<br>\
also called الجِرْبِيَاءُ; and termed نَيِّحَةُ الأَزْيَبِ the<br>\
opposite wind to the ازيب; (S, K;) a cold wind;<br>\
(S;) and sometimes attended by a little rain;<br>\
but Ibn-El-Ajdábee asserts that the جربياء is the<br>\
شمال: (TA:) fourth, the نكباءُ الجَنُوبِ والدَّبُورِ the<br>\
wind that blows in a direction between that of the<br>\
south, or southerly, and that of the west, or<br>\
westerly, wind; also called الهَيْفُ; (in the CK,<br>\
الهَيَفُ;) and termed نَيِّحَةُ النُّكَيْباَءِ the opposite wind<br>\
to the نكيباء; (S, K;) a hot wind (S) and very<br>\
thirsty. (TA.) Accord. to Ibn-Kubás, the tract<br>\
whence blows the نكباء [by which he means only<br>\
the wind that blows from the north-east or thereabout] is that extending between the point where<br>\
rises the ذِرَاع [or the asterism composed of the<br>\
stars a and b of Gemini, E. 33 degrees N., in central<br>\
Arabia; or a and b of Canis Minor, E. 7 degrees N.,<br>\
in the same latitude] and the pole-star: and the<br>\
tract between the pole-star and the point where<br>\
sets the ذراع is the tract whence blows the شمال.<br>\
Sh says, Each of the four [cardinal] winds has<br>\
its نكباء, which is called in relation to it: that of<br>\
the صبا is that which is between it and the شمال;<br>\
[blowing from the north-east, or thereabout;] and<br>\
it resembles it in gentleness; sometimes having<br>\
sharpness, or vehemence; but this is seldom;<br>\
only once in a long space of time: that of the<br>\
شمال is that which is between it and the دبور;<br>\
[blowing from the north-west, or thereabout;] and<br>\
it resembles it in coldness: it is called الشمالُ<br>\
الشَّامِيَّةُ: each of them is called by the Arabs<br>\
شاميّة: that of the دبور is that which is between it<br>\
and the جنوب; blowing from the point where sets<br>\
سُهَيْل [or Canopus; i. e., S. 29 degrees W., in the latitude<br>\
of central Arabia]; and it resembles it in its<br>\
violence and boisterousness: and that of the جنوب<br>\
is that which is between it and the صبا; [blowing<br>\
from the south-east, or thereabout;] and it is the<br>\
wind most resembling it in its softness and in its<br>\
gentleness in winter. (L.) The pl. of نكباء is<br>\
نُكْبٌ, as shown above. (S, K &amp;c.) [See also<br>\
تَبُّوعُ الشَّمْسِ, in art. تبع.] ―<br>\
-b3-  دَبُورٌ نكب [app.<br>\
↓ نَكْبٌ, originally an inf. n., used as an epithet,<br>\

place of junction of the os humeri and the scapula<br>\
and the [tendon called] حَبْلُ العَاتِقِ, in a man<br>\
and a bird and any other thing. (TA.) [It seems<br>\
to be regarded by some as originally signifying<br>\
“ a place of deflection: ” but] Sb denies its<br>\
being a noun of place, because, were it so, it<br>\
would be مَنْكَبٌ: he does not allow it to be<br>\
included in the class of مَطْلِعٌ, because this is<br>\
extr. Pl. مَنَاكِبُ. رَجُلٌ شَدِيدُ المَنَاكِبِ, signifies<br>\
A man having a strong shoulder: as though the<br>\

those of you who keep [most] still therein: or, as<br>\

such as enter the rank in prayer. (TA, from a<br>\

are the strongest and most excellent of the<br>\
feathers; (TA:) four [feathers] in the wing of<br>\
a bird, next after the قوادم (S.) [the four<br>\
secondary feathers of the wing:] in the wing of a<br>\
bird are twenty leathers: the first of them are<br>\
those called القوادم; the next, المناكب; the<br>\
next, الخَوَا فِى: the next, الأَباهِرُ; the next,<br>\
الكُلَى. (L.) It is a word without a sing. (K.)<br>\

by stones. (K.) See 1. ―<br>\
