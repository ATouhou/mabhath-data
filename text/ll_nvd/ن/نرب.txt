الرِّيحُ تُنَيْرِبُ التُّرَابَ فَوْقَهُ, or عَلَى<br>\
الأَرْضِ, (TA,) inf. n. نَيْرَبَةٌ, (TA,) The wind<br>\
lays the dust upon it, or upon the ground, in<br>\
cross, wavy lines: syn. تَنْسِجُهُ. (K.) Hence<br>\
نَيْرَبَ الكَلَام. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It has been asserted<br>\
that ن and ر do not come together in any [pure]<br>\
Arabic word; and F has said the same in art.<br>\
نرش; [or rather he has there said that ر does<br>\
not occur in an Arabic word with ن before it;<br>\
(meaning a radical ن;)] yet he has here mentioned this word as though it were pure Arabic.<br>\
So says MF. To this it may be replied, that ى<br>\
is inserted to separate the ن and ر, as remarked<br>\
in the L. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  نَيْرَبَ He forged [speech,<br>\
or language]: syn. نَسَجَ. (K.) You say هُوَ يُنَيْرِبُ<br>\
القَوْلَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  نَيْرَبَ He mixed, or confounded,<br>\
speech, [introducing what was false with that<br>\
which was true]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  نَيْرَبَ He uttered a<br>\
malicious and mischievous misrepresentation, a<br>\
calumny, or slander. (K.)<br>\
نَيْرَبٌ (S, K) and ↓ نَيْرَبَةٌ (as in several copies<br>\
of the K, [and I am inclined to think that this<br>\
is the correct reading, as it may certainly be<br>\
correctly used in the sense here given, being<br>\
properly an inf. n., agreeably with analogy,] or<br>\
↓ مَنْرَبَةٌ (as in others, which is said in the TA to<br>\
be the correct word, and to be given on the<br>\
authority of AA, [but it exhibits an incongruity<br>\
of letters: see 1:]) Mischief; malicious and mischievous misrepresentation, calumny, or slander.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَيْرَبٌ, fem. with ة; and ذُو نَيْرَبٍ;<br>\
A mischievous man; (K;) one who utters malicious<br>\
and mischievous misrepresentations, calumnies, or<br>\
slanders. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  نَيْرَبٌ A strong man. (K.)<br>\
نَيْرَبَى A calamity; a misfortune. (K.)<br>\
نَيْرَبَةٌ and مَنْرَبَةٌ: see نَيْرَبٌ.<br>\
