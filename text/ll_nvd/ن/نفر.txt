نَفَرَ, (T, M, L, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
نَفِرَ, (T, M, K,)<br>\
and<br>\
نَفُرَ, (M, K,) inf. n. نَفْرٌ and نَفَرَانٌ (M, K)<br>\
or نُفُورٌ, (Msb,) said of a wild animal, (T,<br>\
Msb,) a gazelle, (M, K,) or other beast, (M,)<br>\
He took fright, and fled, or ran away at<br>\
random; or became refractory, and went away<br>\
at random; or ran away, or broke loose, and<br>\
went hither and thither by reason of his sprightliness; syn. شَرَدَ; (M, K;) as also ↓ استنفر;<br>\
(T, Msb, K;) and so the former verb in<br>\
speaking of a camel, or a beast: (L, art. شرد:)<br>\
you say, نَفَرَتِ الدَّابَّةُ, (T, S, M, A, K,) aor.<br>\
نَفِرَ<br>\
and<br>\
نَفُرَ, (T, S, M, K,) inf. n. نُفُورٌ and نِفَارٌ (T,<br>\
S, M, A, K) and نَفْرٌ: (A:) or this signifies<br>\
the beast was, or became, impatient (A, K, TA)<br>\
of or at a thing, (TA,) [or shied at it,] and<br>\
retired to a distance; (A, K, TA;) and ↓ إِسْتِنْفَارٌ<br>\
signifies the same as نُفُورٌ: (S:) or نَفَرَ, inf. n.<br>\
نِفَارٌ [and نُفُورٌ], signifies he fled, and went away<br>\
or aside or apart or to a distance. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence, نَفَرَ, aor.<br>\
نَفِرَ and<br>\
نَفُرَ, inf. n. نُفُورٌ and نِفَارٌ<br>\
and نَفْرٌ and نَفِيرٌ, as used in the following<br>\
phrases.] نَفَرْتُ مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ (tropical:)  I shrank from<br>\
this thing or affair; was averse from it; did<br>\
not like or approve it. And نَفَرَ فُلَانٌ مِنْ صُحْبَةِ<br>\
فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  [Such a one shrank, or was averse, from<br>\
the companionship of, or the associating with,<br>\
such a one]. And نَفَرَتِ المَرْأَةُ مِنْ زَوْجِهَا (tropical:)  [The<br>\
woman was averse from her husband; or shunned<br>\
or avoided him]. (All from the A.) And you<br>\
say of a man&#39;s disposition, عَنِ الحَقِّ ↓ تَنَفَّرَ<br>\
(tropical:)  [It shunned, or was averse from, the truth]<br>\
(Bd, lxvii. 21.) ―<br>\
-b3-  إِلَّا نُفُورًا, in the Kur, [xvii.<br>\
43, and xxxv. 40,] means (tropical:)  Save in aversion<br>\
and نَفِيرٌ is like نُفُورٌ: and the subst. is نَفَرٌ, with<br>\
two fet-hahs. (Msb) ―<br>\
-b4-  نَفَرَ الشَّىْءُ مِنَ الشَّىْءِ<br>\
inf. n. نِفَارٌ [and نُفُورٌ], The thing receded, withdrew, removed, or became remote or aloof, from<br>\
the thing. (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S.) [See also 3.] ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
Hence it is, I think, that نَفَرَ is used as signifying (tropical:)  It became swollen, in the following<br>\
words of a trad. of &#39;Omar: تَخَلَّلَ رَجُلٌ فِى زَمَانِهِ<br>\
بِالقَصَبِ فَنَفَرَ فُوهُ (tropical:)  A man, in his time, picked<br>\
his teeth with reeds, and in consequence his<br>\
mouth became swollen: as though the flesh,<br>\
disliking the disease, receded from it, and so<br>\
became swollen. (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S. *) You say<br>\
also, نَفَرَتِ العَيْنُ, aor.<br>\
نَفِرَ and<br>\
نَفُرَ, inf. n. نُفُورٌ. (tropical:)  His<br>\
eye became inflamed and swollen: and so you<br>\
say of other parts of the person. (M, K. *)<br>\
And نَفَرَ الجُرْحُ, inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  The wound<br>\
became swollen: (T, Msb:) or it became so after<br>\
healing. (W, i. 42.) And نَفَرَ الجِلْدُ (tropical:)  The<br>\
skin became swollen, (S, A,) and the flesh receded<br>\
from it. (A.) [All these significations seem<br>\
to be derived from the first in this art.: and<br>\
so several others which follow.] ―<br>\
-b6-  نَفَرْتُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ,<br>\
inf. n. نِفَارٌ, I betook myself to God by reason of<br>\
fear, seeking protection. (IKtt) ―<br>\
-b7-  نَفَرُوا, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. نَفْرٌ, (M, Msb, K,) They became separated,<br>\
or dispersed: (M, * Msb, K: *) and so نَفَرتْ,<br>\
said of camels. (TA.) Hence, (M,) the<br>\
saying, لَقِيتُهُ قَبْلَ كُلِّ صَيْحٍ وَنَفْرٍ, (S, M, A.)<br>\
a proverb, in which the last word is used<br>\
tropically; (A;) explained in art. صيح, q. v.<br>\
(S.) [And غَضِبَ مِنْ غَيْرِ صَيْحٍ وَلَا نَفٍرْ; explained in the same art.] ―<br>\
-b8-  نَفَرَ الحَاجُّ مِنْ مِنًى,<br>\
(M, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
نَفِرَ, (S, M, K,) inf. n. نَفْرٌ<br>\
(M, Msb, K) and نَفَرٌ (M) and نُفُورٌ (K) [and<br>\
نَفِيرٌ], The pilgrims removed from Minè. (Msb.)<br>\
Hence, يَوْمُ النَّفْرِ, and النَّفَرِ, and النَّفُورِ, and النَّفِيرِ,<br>\
(S, M, K,) and لَيْلَةُ النَّفْرِ, (S, TA,) and النَّفَرِ,<br>\
(TA,) [The day of, and the night immediately<br>\
preceding, the removing from Minè]; after the<br>\
day called يَوْمُ القَرِّ: (S;) [therefore. the twelfth<br>\
of Dhu-l-Hijjeh:] or there are two days thus<br>\
called: (Msb:) يَوْمُ النَّفْرِ الأَوَّلُ is [the day above<br>\
mentioned,] the second of the days called أَيَّامُ<br>\
التَّشْرِيقِ; (IAth, Msb;) and يَوْمُ النَّفْر الاّخِرُ,<br>\
(IAth,) or الثَّانِى, (Msb,) is the third thereof:<br>\
(IAth, Msb:) the order is this; يَوْمُ النَّحْرِ,<br>\
then يَوْمُ القَرِّ, then يَوْمُ النَّفْر الأَوَّلُ then يَوْمُ<br>\
النَّفْرِ الآخِرُ. (T, L) ―<br>\
-b9-  نَفَرُوا فِى الأَمْرِ, (S, M.)<br>\
or لِلْأَمْرِ, (K,) aor.<br>\
نَفِرَ, (M, K.) inf. n. نُفُورٌ (S, M,<br>\
K) and نِفارٌ (M, K) and نَفِيرٌ; (Zj, M, K;) and<br>\
↓ تنافروا; (M, K;) They went, or went away,<br>\
to execute the affair: (M, K:) and in like<br>\
manner, فِى القِتَالِ to fight. (M.) And نَقَرُوا,<br>\
alone, They went forth to war against unbelievers<br>\
or the like. So in the Kur, is 82. وَقَالوا لَا تَنْفِرُوا<br>\
فى الحرِّ قُلْ نَارٌ جَهَنَّمَ أَشَدٌ حَرَّا [And they said,<br>\
Go not ye forth to war against the unbelievers in<br>\
the heat: say, The fire of hell is hotter]: and<br>\
so in the same chap. v. 39: (Jel:) and in the<br>\
same book, iv. 73. (Bd.) You say also,<br>\
نَفَرُوا لَهُمْ They went forth to fight them. (TA,<br>\
from a trad.) And تَفَرُوا إِلى الحَرْب They<br>\
hastened to the war, or to war. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
[Hence,] نَفَوُا مَعَهُ; and ↓ أَنْفَرُوهُ, (M, K,) inf. n.<br>\
إِنْفَارٌ; (TA;) They aided and succoured them:<br>\
(M, K:) or the former verb, alone, they, being<br>\
asked to do so, complied, and went forth to aid.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  نَفرَبِنَا: see 2.<br>\
2<br>\
نَفّر, (T, M, A, Msb,) inf. n. تَنْفيرٌ; (Msb;)<br>\
and ↓ انفر; (T, K;) and ↓ اشتنفر; (T, M, A,<br>\
Msb;) He made (wild animals, T. Msb, or an<br>\
antelope. K, or a beast of carriage. M,) to take<br>\
fright, and flee, or run away at random: (K, TA:)<br>\
or he made a beast of carriage to become impatient,<br>\
and to retire to a distance: (A:) or he scared<br>\
away; or made to flee, and go away, or aside,<br>\
or apart, or to a distance: (so accord. to an<br>\
explanation of the intrans. v. from which it is<br>\
derived, in the M:) you say نَفَّرْتُهُ and ↓ اِسْتَنْفَرْتُهُ<br>\
and ↓ أَنْفَرُتُهُ: and in like manner, نَفَّرَ عَنْهُ, and<br>\
أَنْفَرَ عَنْهُ, [meaning, he scared away, or made to<br>\
take fright and flee, &amp;c., from him or it:]<br>\
(TA:) الإِنْفَارُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ, and التَّنْفِيرُ عَنْهُ, and<br>\
الاِسْتِنْفَارُ, all signify the same, [i. e., the scaring<br>\
away, &amp;c. from a thing.] (S.) It is said in a<br>\
trad. of Zeyneb, the daughter of Mohammad,<br>\
فَأَنْفَرَ بِهَا المُشْرِكُونَ بَعِيرَهَا حَتَّى سَقَطَتْ And<br>\
the polytheists made her camel to take fright and<br>\
run away at random with her, so that she fell.<br>\
And in like manner you say, أُنْفِرَبِنَا, and نُفِرَبِنَا,<br>\
[or نُفَّرَبِنَا Our camels were scared away with<br>\
us; or made to take fright and run away at<br>\
random with us: or] we were made to be persons<br>\
having camels taking fright and running away<br>\
at random. And تَنْفِيرٌ signifies The chiding camels or sheep or goats, and driving them from<br>\
the pasturage. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence] بَشِّروا وَلا تُنَفِّرُوا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Rejoice people by what ye say. and] do not<br>\
encounter them with [roughness and violence and]<br>\
that which will incite them to نُفُور [i. e. flight or<br>\
aversion]. (TA.) See the act. part. n., below.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] نَفِّرْ عَنْهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَسنْفِيرٌ.<br>\
(TA.) (assumed tropical:)  Give thou to him a لَقَب [meaning a<br>\
nickname or name of reproach], (S,) or a لَقب<br>\
that is disliked: (K:) as though they held such<br>\
to be تَسْفِيرٌ لِلْجِنِّ وَالعَيْنِ عَنْهُ [a means of scaring<br>\
away the jinn, or genii, and the evil eye, from<br>\
him]. (S, K.) An Arab of the desert said,<br>\
When I was born, it was said to my father,<br>\
نَفِّرْ عَنْهُ: so he named me قُنْفُد [hedge-hog],<br>\
and surnamed me أَبو العَدّآءِ [father of the quick<br>\
runner]. (S.)<br>\
3<br>\
نَاْفَرَ [نَافَرَا, inf. n. مُنَافَرَةٌ, (tropical:)  They shunned or<br>\
avoided each other; regarded each other with<br>\
aversion. But perhaps this signification is only<br>\
post-classical. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (tropical:)  They (two things)<br>\
were incongruous, or discordant, each with the<br>\
other. But perhaps this signification, also, is<br>\
only post-classical. See also 6.]<br>\

أَنْفَرَ see 2, in several places. ―<br>\
-b2-  أَنْفَرُوا Their<br>\
camels took fright and ran away at random,<br>\
(نَفَرَت, K, TA,) and became separated or dispersed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 1, last signification.<br>\

تنفّر عَنِ الحَقِّ: see 1.<br>\
6<br>\
تَنَاْفَرَ [تنافروا (tropical:)  They shunned or avoided one<br>\
another; regarded one another with aversion.<br>\
But perhaps this signification is only post-classical. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, تنافرت الأَشْيَآءُ (tropical:)  The things<br>\
were incongruous, or discordant, one with another.<br>\
But perhaps this signification, also, is only postclassical. See also 3.] ―<br>\
-b3-  تنافروا فِى الأَمْرِ, or<br>\
لِلْأَمْرِ: see 1, towards the end. See also تَنَافَرَا<br>\
in the K: and compare 6 in arts. نفد and نفذ.<br>\

إِسْتَنْفَرَهُمْ He (the Imám) incited, and<br>\
summoned or invited them to go forth, لِجِهَادِ<br>\
العَدُوِّ to war against the enemy: (T, Mgh:)<br>\
or imposed upon them the task of going forth to<br>\
war, light and heavy: [see Kur, ix. 41:] (A:)<br>\
or he demanded, sought, or desired, of them aid.<br>\

نَفْرٌ: see نَافِرٌ, of which it is a quasi-pl.: ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
and نَفِيرٌ: ―<br>\
-b3-  and نَفَرٌ.<br>\
نِفْرٌ an imitative sequent to عِفْرٌ, (T, M, K,)<br>\
and so is ↓ نَفِرٌ to عَفِرٌ, (Sgh, K, but omitted in<br>\
some copies of the K,) and ↓ نِفْرِيَةٌ to عِفْرِيَةٌ,<br>\
(T, M, K,) and ↓ نِفْرِيتٌ to عِفْرِيتٌ, (T, S, M,<br>\
K,) and ↓ نُفَارِيَةٌ to عُفَارِيَهٌ, (T, M, K,) and ↓ نِفْرِيتَةٌ<br>\
to عِفرِيتَةٌ; (K;) denoting corroboration. (S.)<br>\

(S, Msb;) as also ↓ نَفْرٌ and ↓ نَفْرَةٌ and ↓ نَفِيرٌ:<br>\

[but probably سبعة is a mistake for تسعة nine:<br>\
this appears likely from what here follows:])<br>\
or a number of men less then ten; (AZ, T, M,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ نَفِيرٌ; (K;) and so رَهْطٌ; (AZ,<br>\
T;) and some add, excluding women: (TA:)<br>\
accord. to Fr, (S,) a man&#39;s people or tribe consisting of his nearer relations; as also ↓ نَفْرَةٌ; syn.<br>\

(M, K:) accord. to Lth, you say, هٰؤُلَآءِ عَشَرَةُ نَفَرٍ,<br>\
i. e. these are ten men: but one does not say,<br>\
عِشْرُونَ نَفَرًا, nor more than عَشَرَة: and Abu-l-<br>\
&#39;Abbás says, that نَفَرٌ, like قَوْمٌ and رَهْطٌ, has a<br>\
pl. signification, without any proper sing.; and<br>\
is applied to men, exclusively of women: (T:)<br>\
it is a quasi-pl. n.: (TA:) and its pl. is أَنْفَارٌ;<br>\
(M, K;) occurring in a trad., in the phrase<br>\
أَحَدٌ مِنْ أَنْفَارِنَا, which IAth explains as meaning any one of our people; syn. قَوْمِنَا: (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ نَفِيرٌ, occurring, in the accus. case, in the<br>\
Kur, xvii. 6, is, accord. to Zj, a pl. [or rather quasipl. n.] of نَفَرٌ, like عَبِيدٌ and كَلِيبٌ. (M.) [See<br>\
also نَفِيرٌ, below.] Imra-el-Keys says, describing<br>\
a man as an excellent archer,<br>\
فَهْوَ لَا تَنْمِى رَمِيَّتُهُ<br>\
مَا لَهُ لَا عُدَّ مِنْ نَفَرِهْ<br>\
(S,) And he is such that the animal shot by him<br>\
does not go away after it has been shot and then<br>\
die. What aileth him? May he be killed, so as<br>\
not to be numbered among his people. The latter<br>\
hemistich is a proverb. (Meyd.) The poet here<br>\
utters an imprecation against the man, but in so<br>\
doing praises him; as when you say, of a man<br>\
whose action pleases you, مَا لَهُ قَاتَلَهُ اللّٰهُ and<br>\
أَخْزَاهُ اللّٰهُ [q. v.]. (S.) The rel. n. is ↓ نَفَرِىٌّ.<br>\
(Sb, M.)<br>\
-A2-  [Accord. to the Msb, it is also a<br>\
simple subst. from نَفَرَ: and app. as signifying<br>\

نَفِرٌ: see نِفْرٌ.<br>\
نَفْرَةٌ: see نَفِيرٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  A man&#39;s near kinsmen; syn.<br>\

and نُفُورَةٌ signifies a man&#39;s near kinsmen (أُسْرَة)<br>\

him or oppresses him severely or suddenly. (TA.)<br>\
You say, جَآءَنَا فِى نَفْرَتِهِ and ↓ نَفَرِهِ, (T, TA,)<br>\
&amp;c., (TA,) He came to us among his near kinsmen, (T, TA,) &amp;c. (TA.) And, غَلَبَتْ نُفُورَتُنَا<br>\
نُفُورَتَهُمْ Our near kinsmen overcame their near<br>\
kinsmen. (T, TA.) See also نَفَرٌ, in two places:<br>\

نِفَارٌ a subst. from نَفَرَتِ الدَّابَّةُ. Ex. فِى الدَّابَّةِ<br>\
نِفَارٌ [In the beast of carriage is a disposition to<br>\
take fright and run away at random]. (S.) And<br>\
in like manner, from نَفَرَ said of a wild animal.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
نَفُورٌ: see نَافِرٌ.<br>\
نَفِيرٌ A people hastening to war, or to some<br>\
other undertaking: an inf. n. used as a subst.:<br>\
(Msb:) or a people going to execute an affair:<br>\
(S:) or a people going with one to fight; as also<br>\
↓ نَفْرَةٌ [q. v.] and ↓ نَفْرٌ: (M, K:) each is a<br>\
noun having a pl. signification: (M:) or the<br>\
first and last signify a company of men: and<br>\
the pl. of each is أَنْفَارٌ: (M:) or the first, (S,)<br>\
or all, (K,) a people, (S,) or company, (K,)<br>\
preceding in an affair: (S, K:) or the first,<br>\
those of a man&#39;s people who go forth with him to<br>\
war: or it is a pl. [or quasi-pl.] of نَفَرٌ, signifying<br>\
men assembled to go to the enemy: (Bd, xvii. 6:)<br>\
or aiders, or assistants. (M.) [See نَفَرٌ, in<br>\

and نَفِيرُهُمْ, The company of the sons of such a<br>\
one, that came forth to execute an affair, arrived.<br>\
(S, TA.) نَفِيرُ قُرَيْشٍ means Those of Kureysh<br>\
who went forth to Bedr to defend the caravan of<br>\
Aboo-Sufyán, (M,) which was coming from<br>\
Syria. (T.) Hence the proverb, فُلَانٌ لَا فِى<br>\
العِيرِ وَلَا فِى النَّفِيرِ [Such a one is neither in<br>\
the caravan nor in the company going forth to<br>\
fight]: applied to him who is not regarded as<br>\
fit for a difficult undertaking: because none held<br>\
back from the caravan and the fight except him<br>\
who was crippled by disease and him in whom<br>\
was no good; (TA:) or the original words of<br>\
the proverb are لا فِى العِيرِ وَلَا فِى النَّفِيرِ: and<br>\
these words were first said by Aboo-Sufyán,<br>\
with reference to the Benoo-Zuhrah, when he<br>\
found them turning back towards Mekkeh; and,<br>\
accord. to As, are applied to a man who is held<br>\
in low and little repute. (Mgh.) [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov., ii. 500.]<br>\
نُفُورَةٌ: see نَفْرَةٌ, in three places.<br>\
نُفَارِيَةٌ: see نِفْرٌ.<br>\
نَافِرٌ [and ↓ نَفُورٌ] and ↓ مُسْتَنْفِرٌ signify the same;<br>\

or the second, being of an intensive form, signifies, as also ↓ يَنْفُورٌ, that does so much or often; or<br>\
wont or apt to do so:] (TA:) and نَفْرٌ is a pl. of<br>\
نَافِرٌ, (K,) or [rather] a quasi-pl., like as صَحْبٌ is<br>\
of صَاحِبٌ, and زَوْرٌ of زَائِرٌ. (M.) You say,<br>\
دَابَّةٌ نَافِرٌ, and ↓ نَفُورٌ, [A beast that takes fright<br>\
and runs away at random: &amp;c.:] (M, K:)<br>\
accord. to IAar, one should not say نَافِرَةٌ (M)<br>\
[unless using it as an epithet applied to a broken<br>\
pl. of a subst., as will be seen below]. It is said<br>\
in a proverb, ↓ كُلُّ أَزَبَّ نَفُورٌ [Every one, of<br>\
camels, that is hairy on the face is wont to take<br>\
fright and run away at random: see art. زب].<br>\
(M.) You say also ↓ ظَبْىٌ يَنْفُورٌ, (M, K, *) in<br>\
some copies of the K, نيفور, (TA,) A gazelle that<br>\
