signifies specially the raising of the voice: (MF,<br>\
from the first part of the Keshsháf:) or the rising of<br>\
the voice; so with the Arabs; and one says نَبَرَ الرَّجُلُ,<br>\

tone: (IAmb:) and نَبَرَ, inf. n. نَبْرَةٌ, he (a man)<br>\

يَا نَبِىْءَ اللّٰهِ [O Prophet of God]; and he said<br>\
لَا تَنْبِرْ يِاسْمِى, i. e. Pronounce not thou my name<br>\
with hemz: (M:) for the tribe of Kureysh did not<br>\
pronounce with hemz. (TA.) And when ElMahdee performed the pilgrimage, he preferred<br>\
El-Kisáee to recite the prayers in El-Medeeneh,<br>\
and the people of that city disapproved of his<br>\
pronouncing with hemz, asking him wherefore<br>\
he did so in reciting the Kur-án in the mosque<br>\
of the Apostle of God. (TA.)<br>\

syn. أَكْدَاسٌ, (M, K,) or a collection, (M, S,) of<br>\
طَعَام, (S, M, K, MS,) meaning of wheat, and of<br>\
barley, [or other corn,] and of dates: (MS:) or<br>\
[in the TA, and] granaries (أَهْرَآء) of طَعَام: (in<br>\
the present day, a granary:] what is called هُرْىٌ<br>\

the sing. is نِبْرٌ: but this addition seems to be<br>\
misplaced: for انبار in the last of the senses here<br>\
explained, as well as when applied to a granary.<br>\
and to a collection of طعام, appears to be a pl.<br>\
without a sing.]<br>\
