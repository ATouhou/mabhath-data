مِنْ عِقَالٍ (tropical:)  [And when he who is smitten by the evil<br>\
eye is charmed by a نُشْرَة, he is as though he were<br>\
loosed from a bond]: i. e., it [the effect of the eye]<br>\
departs from him speedily. (S [in two copies of<br>\
which I find نُشِرَ, as above; but in the TA, ↓ نُشِّرَ.])<br>\
And in a trad. it is said, بِقُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِ ↓ نَشَّرَهُ<br>\

him [by the words “ Say I seek refuge in the Lord<br>\

[in the Kur, ii. 261,] كَيْفَ نُنْشِرُهَا [How we will<br>\
raise them to life], and adduces in his favour the<br>\
words [in the Kur. lxxx. 22,] ↓ ثُمَّ إِذَا شَآءَ أَنْشَرَهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Then, when He pleaseth, He raiseth him to<br>\
life]: El-Hasan reads نَنْشُرُهَا: [and others read<br>\
نُنْشِزُهَا, with záy:] but Fr says, that El-Hasan<br>\
holds it to refer to unfolding and folding, and<br>\
that the proper way is to use انشر [in this sense,]<br>\
transitively, and نَشَرَ intransitively. (S, TA.)<br>\
[See also طَوَىَ, which has the contr. meaning.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, الرَّضَاعُ العَظْمَ ↓ أَنْشَرَ: i. q. أَنْشَزَ, with<br>\

person) lived after death; came to life again;<br>\
revived; (S, TA;) or lived; came to life; (A,<br>\

inf. n. نَشْرٌ, (K, TA,) (tropical:)  It (herbage, or pasturage,)<br>\

a beast, occasioned by fatigue: (S:) AO says,<br>\
that the sinew, or tendon, which becomes inflated,<br>\

is termed تَحَرُّكُ الشَّظَى is similar to this affection,<br>\
excepting in its not being so well endured by the<br>\

has dried up and then become green in consequence<br>\

animals when it first appears, and men flee from<br>\
it with their camels &amp;c.; (S, TA;) which it<br>\
affects with the [disease called] سُهَام when they<br>\
pasture upon it at its first appearance: [see<br>\
remarks on a verse cited in art. بيض, voce بَاضَ:<br>\
and see another verse in art. جرب, voce أَجْرَبُ:]<br>\
AHn says, that it does not injure animals with the<br>\

(S.) And جَآءَ القَوْمُ نَشَرًا The people came in a<br>\
scattered, or dispersed, state. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Hence<br>\
also, نَشَرُ المَآء What is sprinkled, of water, (Mgh,<br>\
TA,) in the performance of the ablution termed<br>\
الوُضُوْء. (TA.) It is said in a trad., أَتَمْلِكُ نَشَرَ<br>\
المَآءِ [Dost thou possess what is sprinkled of water?]<br>\
(S;) or مَنْ يَمْلِكُ نَشَرَ المَآءِ [Who possesseth what<br>\
is sprinkled of water?] (Mgh;) [app. meaning,<br>\
that it is gone and cannot be recovered.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
hence, أَللّٰهُمَّ اضْمُمْ نَشَرِى (assumed tropical:)  O God, compose what<br>\
is discomposed, or disorganized, of my affairs:<br>\
(K, * TA:) a phrase like لُمَّ شَعَثِى. (TA.)<br>\

spreads [the clouds], or scatters [the rain]; (S;<br>\
and Bd, vii. 55;) نَشُورٌ being syn. with نَاشِرٌ:<br>\
(Bd:) or it signifies in a scattered state. (Jel,<br>\
vii. 55.) [In the Kur, ubi supra,] يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ<br>\

↓ نَشَرًا, [Sendeth the winds, &amp;c.,] (K, * TA,) all<br>\
these being various readings, (TA,) نُشُرًا is pl. of<br>\
نَشُورٌ, (Bd, K,) in the sense of نَاشِرٌ; (Bd;) or<br>\
