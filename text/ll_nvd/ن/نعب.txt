words يَا رَازِق النَّعَّابِ فِى عُشِّهِ [O Sustainer of the<br>\
young raven (or young crow) in his nest!]. It is<br>\
said that the young raven (or young crow), when<br>\
it comes forth from its egg, is white, like a lump<br>\
of fat, and that the old bird, on seeing it, dislikes<br>\
and abandons it; that thereupon God sends to it<br>\
gnats, which light upon it on account of its foul<br>\
greasy smell, and that it lives upon them until it<br>\
is fledged and becomes black, when its parents<br>\
return to it. (L.)<br>\
