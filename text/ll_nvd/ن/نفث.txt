نَفَثَ, aor.<br>\
نَفِثَ and<br>\
نَفُثَ, inf. n. نَفْثٌ (S, K) and<br>\
نَفَثَانٌ, (TA,) [He puffed; or blew, without<br>\
spitting: or he sputtered, or blew forth a little<br>\
spittle in minute scattered particles: or] he spat:<br>\
or he [did as though he] spat without ejecting<br>\
spittle: and نَفَثَ فى العُقْدَةِ signifies he spat,<br>\
ejecting a little spittle, upon the knot, in enchantment: (Msb:) or النَّفْثُ is like النَّفْخُ, or blowing,<br>\
and less than التَّفْلُ, or spitting, or ejecting spittle<br>\
from the mouth: (S, K:) or like blowing, with<br>\
[the emission of] spittle: (Keshsháf;) or like<br>\
blowing, as done in enchantment, without spittle:<br>\
the action, if accompanied by spittle, being<br>\
termed التفل: this is the most correct explanation: (&#39;Ináyeh:) or gentle blowing without<br>\
spittle: (الاذكار:) or more than blowing; or<br>\
like blowing; but less than spitting: sometimes<br>\
without spittle, thus differing from التفل; and<br>\
sometimes with a little spittle, thus differing from<br>\
النفخ: or the emitting wind from the mouth,<br>\
together with a little spittle. (MF.) ―<br>\
