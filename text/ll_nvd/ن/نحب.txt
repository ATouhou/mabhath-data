كَمَا صَارَ عَنْ يُمْنَى يَدَيْهِ المُنَحِّبُ<br>\
By المنحّب is meant the man. ISd says, Th<br>\
cites this verse, and says in explanation of it,<br>\
This was a man who swore, saying, If I do not<br>\
overcome, I will cut off my hand. He seems to<br>\
consider it as implying the signification of vowing.<br>\
So in the L. But it requires consideration.<br>\
