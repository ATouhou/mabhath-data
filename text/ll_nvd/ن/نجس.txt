نَجَسَ; (S, Msb, K;) and نَجَسَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
نَجُسَ; (Msb;) and نَجُسَ, aor.<br>\
نَجُسَ, (K,) accord.<br>\
to some, but the books of good repute are silent<br>\
respecting this last; (Msb;) inf. n. نَجَسٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb, TA,) of the first; (Msb;) and نَجَاسَةٌ,<br>\
(TA,) or this last is a simple subst. [as the verb<br>\
نَجُسَ to which by rule it should belong is not of<br>\
good authority]; (Msb;) It was, or became,<br>\
unclean, dirty, filthy, or impure; (Msb;) [i. e.,]<br>\
contr. of طَهَرَ, or طَهُرَ: (Msb, K: *) نَجَاسَة is of<br>\
two kinds; one kind is perceived by sense; and<br>\
one kind is perceived by the mind; of which<br>\
latter kind is that which is attributed, in the<br>\
Kur, ix. 28, to those who assert God to have<br>\
associates: (Er-Rághib, B:) but in this latter<br>\
sense, it is said by Z, to be tropical. (TA.) [See also<br>\
نَجَاسَةٌ below.] You also say, (of a garment,<br>\
A, Msb,) ↓ تنجّس, meaning, It was, or became,<br>\
rendered unclean, dirty, filthy, or impure. (A,<br>\
Msb, K.)<br>\
-A2-  نَجْسٌ, [app. an inf. n. of which<br>\
the verb is نَجَسَ,] The making a child&#39;s عُودَة<br>\
[or amulet, of any of the kinds described below,<br>\
voce تَنْجِيسٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
نجّسهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَنْجِيسٌ,<br>\
(TA,) He rendered him, or it, unclean, dirty,<br>\
filthy, or impure; (A, Msb, K;) and ↓ انجسهُ<br>\
signifies the same. (S, A, K.) El-Hasan said<br>\
of a man who married a woman with whom he<br>\
had committed fornication, فَهُوَ أَحَقُّ بِهَا ↓ هُوَ أَنْجَسَهَا<br>\
[He defiled her, therefore he is most worthy of<br>\
her]. (A, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَجَّسَتْهُ الذُّنُوبُ (tropical:)  [Sins, or<br>\
crimes, defiled him]. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  نجّس لَهُ, and<br>\
نجّسهُ, He charmed him; or fortified him by a<br>\
charm or an amulet [of any of the kinds described<br>\
below, voce تَنْجِيسٌ, q. v.]; syn. عَوَّذَهُ. (TA.)<br>\

أَنْجَسَ see 2, in two places.<br>\
5<br>\
تنجّس: see نَجِسَ.<br>\
-A2-  He did a deed whereby to become free from uncleanness, dirt, filth, or<br>\
impurity; (K;) like as you say تَأَثَّمَ and تَحَرَّجَ<br>\
and تَحَنَّثَ, meaning, he did a deed whereby to<br>\
become free from crime, sin, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
نَجْسٌ: see نَجِسٌ.<br>\

نَجِسٌ and ↓ نَجَسٌ (S, A, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
↓ نَجُسٌ and ↓ نَجْسٌ and ↓ نِجْسٌ (A, O, K) Unclean, dirty, filthy, or impure: (A, Msb, K:)<br>\
the last of these is only used when the word is<br>\
preceded or followed by رِجْسٌ: (ISd:) or only<br>\
when it is preceded by رِجْسٌ: (Fr, S, * and Har<br>\
in the Durrat-el-Ghowwás:) but this remark<br>\
correctly applies only to the greater number of<br>\
instances: (M, F:) the second of the above five<br>\
forms is an inf. n. used as an epithet; (A, Msb;)<br>\
and is [therefore] used as sing. and dual. and pl.<br>\
and masc. and fem., without variation: (TA:)<br>\
[and the first and last are also used as pls., as<br>\
will be seen below; but when so used, I suppose<br>\
قَوْمٌ or some other coll. gen. n. to be understood:]<br>\
the pl. [of every one of the other forms] is أَنْجَاسٌ<br>\
(A, Msb, TA) and [of the fourth and fifth, and<br>\
perhaps of the first and third also, though I do<br>\
not remember similar instances,] نِجْسَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
[See also نَجَاسَةٌ, below.] نَجِسٌ and ↓ نَجْسٌ<br>\
[&amp;c.], applied to a man, signify Unclean, &amp;c.,<br>\
[both properly and tropically]. (TA.) [The<br>\
two following examples are said in the A to be<br>\
tropical.] النَّاسُ أَجْنَاسٌ وَأَكْثَرُهُمْ أَنْجَاسٌ (tropical:)  [Men<br>\
are of several kinds, and most of them are unclean.]<br>\
(A, TA.) And إِنَّمَا الْمُشْرِكُونَ نَجَسٌ (tropical:)  [Verily<br>\
the associaters of others with God are but unclean],<br>\
said in the Kur, [ix. 28,] (S, A, TA,) or نَجِسٌ,<br>\
or ↓ نِجْسٌ, accord. to certain readers. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also, all the above forms, A man having an incurable disease. (TA.) ―<br>\

disease that baffles the مُنَجِّسُون. (A.) See<br>\
مُنَجِّسٌ.<br>\
أَنْجَسُ [More, and most, unclean, dirty, filthy,<br>\
or impure]. You say, لَا تَرَى أَنْجَسَ مِنَ الكَافِرِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Thou wilt not see any one more unclean than the<br>\
unbeliever]. (A, TA.)<br>\
تَنْجِيسٌ The name of a thing, either something<br>\
unclean, or bones of the dead, or a menstruous<br>\
rag, which used to be hung upon him for whom<br>\
there was a fear of the jinn&#39;s, or genii&#39;s, being<br>\
attached to him: (K:) or the hanging of some<br>\
such thing upon such a person, as a child or any<br>\
other; for they used to say that the jinn would<br>\
not approach those things: (TA:) or a thing<br>\
which the Arabs used to do, as an amulet, to drive<br>\
away thereby the [evil] eye: (S:) ↓ مُنَجِّسَةٌ also<br>\
is the name of a kind of amulet: (IAar:) and<br>\
↓ نِجَاسٌ is syn. with تَعْوِيذٌ; [by which may be<br>\
meant either that it signifies an amulet, or that it<br>\
is a quasi-inf. n. of 2; for it is said that] it is<br>\
app. a subst. from نَجَّسَ لَهُ, or نَجَّسَهُ, as signifying<br>\
عَوَّذَهُ. (IAar.) See also 2.<br>\
مُنَجِّسٌ One who hangs, upon him for whom<br>\
there is fear, unclean things, such as bones of the<br>\
dead, and the like, to drive away the jinn, or<br>\
genii; because these beings shun such things; (S, *<br>\
A, TA;) one who fortifies by charms or amulets<br>\
[of the kinds above mentioned]; syn, مُعَوِّذٌ: (K:)<br>\
pl. مُنَجِّسُونَ: (A:) and ↓ نُجُسٌ [a pl. of which<br>\
the sing. is not mentioned] is syn. with مُعَوِّذُونَ.<br>\

bow-string. (TA.)<br>\
