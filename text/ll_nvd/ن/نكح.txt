نَكَحَ, (S, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
نَكِحَ, (Msb, K,) and<br>\
نَكَحَ, (K,) the latter agreeable with analogy, but<br>\
by some rejected, and the former contr. to<br>\
analogy, but more common, and the form used<br>\
in the Kur, (TA,) the only instance of an aor.<br>\
of this form from a verb having ح for its last<br>\
radical letter, except ينطح and يمنح and ينضح<br>\
and ينبح and يرجح and يأنح and يأزح and<br>\
يملح, (ISd,) [and يضح] inf. n. نِكَاحٌ (S, K, &amp;c.)<br>\
and نَكْحٌ; (ISd, K;) Inivit feminam: and<br>\
(sometimes, S) he married, took in marriage, or<br>\
contracted a marriage with, a woman: as also<br>\
↓ استنكح (S, K, &amp;c.) [and ↓ ناكح, inf. n.<br>\
مُنَاكَحَةٌ:] used only with reference to a man:<br>\
(ISd:) but Th uses it with reference to flies:<br>\
(TA:) J says, that it is sometimes used in the<br>\
latter sense; but accord. to the Msb it is more<br>\
commonly so used; (MF;) and it is used only<br>\
in this sense in the Kur: (TA:) IF and others<br>\
say, that it signifies coitus; and coitus without<br>\
marriage; and marriage without coitus: (Msb:)<br>\
[but] in the Time of Ignorance, when a man<br>\
demanded a woman in marriage he said,<br>\
اِنْكِحِينِى; and when he desired fornication, he<br>\
said, سَافِحِينِى. (TA, in art سفح.) It is disputed whether it be proper or tropical in these<br>\
two senses; or proper in one, and tropical in<br>\
one: (MF:) it is said to be from نَكَحَهُ الدَّوَى,<br>\
or from تَنَاكَحَتِ الأَشْجَارُ, or from نَكَحَ المَطَرُ<br>\
الأَرْضَ; and if so, it is tropical in both the above<br>\
senses; and the opinion that it is so is confirmed<br>\
by this, that the signification of marriage is not<br>\
understood unless by a word or phrase in connexion with it, as when you say نَكَحَ فِى بَنِى<br>\
فُلَانٍ [he took a wife from among the sons of<br>\
such a one]; nor is that of coitus unless by the<br>\
same means, as when you say نَكَحَ زَوْجَتَهُ [inivit conjugem suam]; and this is one of the signs<br>\
of a tropical expression. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَكَحَتْ She<br>\
married, or took a husband. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  نَكَحَ<br>\
المَطَرُ الأَرْضَ The rain became commingled with<br>\
the soil: (Msb:) or, rested upon the ground so as to<br>\
soak it; syn. إِعْتَمَدَ عَلَيْهَا: (K:) as also ↓ نَاكَهَا.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  نَكَحَهُ الدَّوَى The disease infected him<br>\
(خَامَرهُ), and overcame him. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  نَكَحَ<br>\
النُّعَاسُ عَيْنَهُ (tropical:)  Drowsiness overcame his eye;<br>\
(K;) as also نَاكَهَا: and in like manner ↓ استنكح<br>\
النَّوْمُ عَيْنَهُ sleep overcame his eye. (TA.)<br>\

انكحهُ المَرْأَةَ He married the woman to<br>\
him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَنْكَحَهَا He married the woman;<br>\
i. e. gave her in marriage. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَنْكِحُوا<br>\
الحَصَى أَخْفَافَ الإِبِلِ (tropical:)  [Accustom ye the feet<br>\
of the camels to pebbles]. (A.)<br>\

تناكحوا They intermarried; contracted<br>\
marriages together. (Commencing a trad. in<br>\
the Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer.) [And تَنَاكَحَا Se invicem<br>\
futuerunt: see 6, in art. ردف] ―<br>\
-b2-  تَنَاكَحَتِ<br>\
الأَشْجَارُ The trees became drawn, or connected,<br>\
together. (Msb.)<br>\

إِسْتَنْكَحَ see 1.<br>\
نِكْحٌ and ↓ نُكْحٌ substs. from أَنْكَحَهَا, [The act<br>\
of giving a woman in marriage]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [These<br>\
two words are properly quasi-inf. ns, of أَنْكَحَ,<br>\
signifying as explained above; and, like inf. ns.,<br>\
may be used as epithets, meaning A giver of a<br>\
woman in marriage, correlative to خُِطْبٌ.] It<br>\
was a custom, in the time of paganism, for a<br>\
man to come to a tribe asking for a woman in<br>\
marriage; and he would stand up in their assembly, and say خِطْبٌ, i. e., I have come as an asker<br>\
of a woman in marriage; whereupon it would<br>\
be said to him نِكْحٌ, meaning We marry her to<br>\
thee, or give her to thee in marriage, [or, more<br>\
lit., we are givers of her in marriage: for an inf.<br>\
n. or quasi-inf. n. used as an epithet is used<br>\
without variation as sing., dual., and pl.; and<br>\
masc. and fem.]. ↓ نُكْحٌ was also said: but نِكْحٌ<br>\
is here said for the sake of resemblance to خِطْبٌ.<br>\
(L.) You say هو نِكْحُهَا He is the person who<br>\
gives her in marriage: and هِىَ نِكْحَتُهُ She is the<br>\
person whom he gives in marriage. (Lh, L) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
نِكْحٌ and ↓ نُكْحٌ, [and, accord. to Lth and ISh,<br>\
نِكِحٌ: see إِبِدٌ:] are also two words by which the<br>\
[Pagan] Arabs used to take women in marriage:<br>\
(S:) [meaning A giver of a woman in marriage].<br>\
(MF, in art. خطب.) A man used to say to<br>\
Umm-Khárijeh, in asking her in marriage, خُِطْبٌ,<br>\
and she used to reply نُكِْحٌ: hence the saying<br>\
أَسْرَعُ مِنْ نِكَاحِ أُمِّ خَارِجَةَ [Quicker than the marriage of Umm-Khárijeh]. (S, K.) [See خِطْبٌ].<br>\
نُكْحٌ: see نِكْحٌ.<br>\
نُكَحٌ: see نَكَحُةٌ.<br>\
رَجُلٌ نُكَحَةٌ, (S, K,) and ↓ نُكَحٌ (K) A man<br>\
who marries much, or often: (S, K, TA:) AZ<br>\
explains the former by شَدِيدُ النِّكَاحِ, [app. meaning<br>\
vehement in coitus,] and mentions as its pl. نُكَحَاتٌ:<br>\
(TA:) [and ↓ نَكَّاحٌ (A, TA, art. تيس, &amp;c.) signifies the same.]<br>\
نَكَّاحٌ: see نُكَحَةٌ.<br>\
نَاكِحٌ (S, K) and نَاكِحَةٌ, (K,) the latter occurring in poetry, (TA,) A woman married;<br>\
(TA;) having a husband. (S, K, TA.) Ex.<br>\
هِىَ نَاكِحٌ فِى بَنِى فُلاَنٍ She has a husband among<br>\
the sons of such a one. (S.)<br>\
مَنْكَِحٌ and مَنْكُوحَةٌ: see مَنَاكِحُ.<br>\
مَنَاكِحُ Women, or wives; syn. نِسَآءٌ: (K:) a<br>\
pl. having no sing.; or its sing. is ↓ مَنْكَحٌ; [or<br>\
↓ مَنْكِحٌ, which occurs in the S and K, art.<br>\
علث, evidently as signifying a wife; as though<br>\
being a place of نِكَاح;] or ↓ مَنْكُوحَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  إِنَّ المَنَاكِحَ خَيْرَهُا الأَبْكَارُ [Verily the best of<br>\
women to take in marriage are virgins]. A proverb. (TA.)<br>\
