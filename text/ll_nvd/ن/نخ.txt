slave: (ISh:) also, working bulls or cows; (S,<br>\
K;) and so نُخَّةٌ: (K:) Th says that this is the<br>\
correct meaning, because it is from نَخٌّ, signifying<br>\
the “ act of driving vehemently; ” and Ks says<br>\
that this is its meaning, but that it is only نُخَّةٌ,<br>\
with damm: (S:) also, asses, حُمُرٌ, [in the CK,<br>\
خَمْرٌ,] (IAar, L, K,) collectively; (L;) and so<br>\
نُخَّةٌ (L, K) and نِخَّةٌ: (K:) also, [animals] reared<br>\
in houses or tents: (K:) also, whatever are employed in labour, of camels, and bulls or cows, and<br>\
asses, and slaves; as also نُخَّةٌ: (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed:)<br>\
also, pastors; and so نُخَّةٌ: also, drivers, leaders,<br>\
or attendants, of camels: (K:) also, the taking<br>\
of a deenár for himself by the collector of the alms<br>\
required by the law, called صَدَقَة, (S, K,) after<br>\
he has finished receiving those alms: (S:) also,<br>\
the deenár itself so taken is thus called. (K.) In<br>\
all these senses the word نخّة is explained in the<br>\
above trad. (TA.)<br>\
