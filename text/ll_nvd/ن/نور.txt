that is apparent to the sense: (TA:) its ا is<br>\
originally نُوَيْرَةٌ: (S, TA:) it is fem.: (S, M, Msb:)<br>\
and sometimes masc.: (AHn, M, K:) and the<br>\
dim. is أَنْوَارٌ, with و because it is the original<br>\
medial radical, (S,) and with ة because نار is<br>\
fem.: (Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَنْوُرٌ, (S, M, L,)<br>\
in the K أَنْوَارٌ, [which is a mistake, though this<br>\
is also said to be a pl. of نار,] (TA,) and [of<br>\

(S, M, K) and نُورٌ (AAF, S, M, Msb, K) and<br>\
نِيَرَةٌ and نِيَارٌ, (M, K,) and أَنْيَارٌ also occurs, in<br>\
the phrase نَارُ الأَنْيَارِ, in a trad. respecting the<br>\
prison of hell; this phrase, if correctly related,<br>\
perhaps meaning نَارُ النِّيِرَانِ, and انيار being<br>\
originally أَنْوَار. (IAth.) النَّارُ is also applied<br>\
to The fire of hell. (TA:) The Arabs say,<br>\
in cursing their enemies, أَبْعَدَ اللّٰهُ دَارَهُمْ وَأَوْقَدَ<br>\
نَارًا أَثَرَهُمْ [May God make their abode distant,<br>\
and kindle a fire after them!] And it was a<br>\
custom of Arab women, as related by IAar, on<br>\
the authority of El-&#39;Okeyleeyeh, when they<br>\
feared evil from a man, and he removed from<br>\
them, to kindle a fire behind him, with the view<br>\
of causing his evil to depart with him. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
نَارُ الْمُهَوِّلِ A fire which the Arabs used to kindle,<br>\
in the time of ignorance, on the occasion of<br>\
entering into a confederacy: they threw into it<br>\
some salt, which crackled (يُفَقِّعُ) when the fire<br>\
burned it: with this they frightened [one another] in confirmation of the swearing. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
نَارُ الحُبَاحِبِ has been explained in art. حب. ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
نَارٌ also signifies simply Heat. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also,<br>\
(tropical:)  [The fire, meaning] the evil, and excitement,<br>\
or rage, or war; as also ↓ نَائِرَةٌ. (TA.) You<br>\

war]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also, (tropical:)  Opinion; counsel; advice.<br>\
(IAar, T, K.) So in the trad., لَا تَسْتَضِيؤُوا بِنَارِ<br>\
المُشْرِكِينَ, (T,) or بنار أَهْلِ الشِّرْكِ, (K,) (tropical:)  [Seek<br>\
ye not to enlighten yourselves by the counsel of<br>\
the polytheists; i. e.,] seek ye not counsel of the<br>\
polytheists. (IAar, T, A. *) ―<br>\
-b7-  Also, (tropical:)  Any<br>\
brand, or mark, made with a hot iron, upon a<br>\
camel; (As, T, S, M, A, K;) as also ↓ نُورَةٌ<br>\
(M, K) and ↓ نُورٌ: (TA:) pl. as above: (M:)<br>\
or the pl. is نِيَارٌ, and the pl. of the نار that<br>\
burns is نِيرَانٌ. (IAar, Th, T.) The Arabs<br>\
say, مَا نَارُ هٰذِهِ النَّاقَةِ (tropical:)  What is the brand, or<br>\
mark, of this she-camel, with which she is burned?<br>\
(T, S, A. *) And they say, in a proverb,<br>\
بِجَارُهَا نَارُهَا (T, S) Their origin is indicated by<br>\
their mark with which they are burned. (T.)<br>\
The Rájiz says,<br>\
حَتَّى سَقَوْا آبَالَهُمْ بِالنَّارِ<br>\
وَالنَّارُ قَدْ تَشْفِى مِنَ الأُوَارِ<br>\
[Until, or so that, they watered their camels<br>\
because of the brand that they bore: for the<br>\
fire, or the brand, sometimes cures of the heat<br>\
of thirst]: (T, S: *) he means, that, when<br>\
they saw their marks with which they were<br>\
burned, they left the water to them. (S. For<br>\
another reading of this verse, see بِ.) See<br>\
also نَجْرٌ.<br>\
نَوْرٌ Blossoms, or flowers, (M, Msb, K,) of a<br>\
tree, and of a plant: (Msb:) or white blossoms<br>\
or flowers; the yellow being called زَهْرٌ; (M, K;)<br>\
for they become white, and then become yellow:<br>\
(M:) and ↓ نَوْرَةٌ and ↓ نُوَّارٌ signify the same as<br>\
نَوْرٌ: (M, K:) or [rather] نَوْرٌ and نُوَّارٌ signify<br>\
the same; (S, Msb;) [but the former is often<br>\
used as a generic n., signifying a kind of blossom<br>\
or flower: though both are coll. gen. ns.;] and<br>\
نَوْرَةٌ is the n. un. of نَوْرٌ, like as تَمْرَةٌ is of تَمْرٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) and نُوَّارَةٌ is the n. un. of نُوَّارٌ: (S, M,<br>\
L:) and the pl. of نَوْرٌ is أَنْوَارٌ. (M, Msb, K.)<br>\
نُورٌ Light; syn. ضِيَآءٌ, (S,) or ضَوْءٌ; (M, A,<br>\
Msb, K;) whatever it be; (M, A, K;) contr.<br>\
of ظُلْمَةٌ: (Msb:) or the rays thereof: (M, A,<br>\
K:) accord to Z, ضِيَآءٌ [with which ضَوْءٌ is syn.]<br>\
is more intense than نُورٌ: in the Kur, x. 5, the<br>\
sun is termed ضياء, and the moon نور: and it is<br>\
said that ضياء is essential, but نور is accidental<br>\
[light]: (TA:) it is of two kinds, the light of<br>\
the present world and that of the world to come;<br>\
and the former is either perceived sensibly, by<br>\
the eye, and this is what diffuses itself from<br>\
luminous bodies, as the sun and moon and stars,<br>\
and is mentioned in the Kur, 10. 5, referred to<br>\
above; or perceived by the eye of the intellect,<br>\
and this is what diffuses itself of the divine<br>\
lights, as the light of reason and the light of the<br>\
Kur-án; of which divine light mention is made<br>\
in the Kur, 5., former part of verse 15, and<br>\
24., latter part of verse 35; and both of these in<br>\
common are spoken of in the Kur, 6. 1 and<br>\
39. 69: that of the world to come is mentioned in the Kur in lvii. 12 [and lxvi. 8]:<br>\
(B:) the pl. is أَنْوَارٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and نِيرَانٌ;<br>\
(M, K;) the latter mentioned by Th: (M:)<br>\
and ↓ نَوْرَانيَّةٌ signifies the same as نُورٌ. (TA.)<br>\
As نور is a convenience of the pious in the<br>\
present world and the world to come, it is said<br>\
in the Kur, [lvii. 13,] اُنْظُرُونَا نَقْتَبِسْ مِنْ نُورِكُمْ<br>\
[Wait ye for us that we may take of your light].<br>\
(B.) [See also ظُلَمْةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also applied to<br>\
Mohammad: (T, M, K:) it is said by Aboo-Is-hak to be so applied in the Kur, v. 18. (T.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And That which manifests things, (K, TA,)<br>\
and shows to the eyes their true or real state:<br>\
and therefore النُّور is applied in the Kur, vii.<br>\
156, to (tropical:)  that [revelation] which the Prophet<br>\
brought. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  النُّورُ is also one of the<br>\
names of God; meaning, accord. to IAth, He<br>\
by whose light the obscure in perception sees, and<br>\
by whose guidance the erring is directed aright:<br>\
or the Manifest, by whom is every manifestation.<br>\
And أَللّٰهُ نُورُ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ [in the Kur,<br>\
xxiv. 35,] means God is the enlightener of the<br>\
heavens and of the earth: like as فُلَانٌ غِيَاثُنَا<br>\
means مُغِيثُنَا: (TA:) or, as some say, the right<br>\
director of the inhabitants of the heavens and of<br>\
the inhabitants of the earth. (T.) ―<br>\

-A2-  I. q. هِنَآءٌ<br>\
[a word well known to mean Tar, or liquid<br>\
pitch, or a kind thereof; but I do not know this<br>\
signification as applying to نُورَةٌ, nor, app., did<br>\
SM, for he has made it to be the same with<br>\
that which here next follows, from the T].<br>\
(M, K:) or a kind of stone burned and made<br>\
into كِلْس [or quick-lime] and used as a depilatory for the pubes: (T:) or lime-stone; syn.<br>\
حَجَرُ الكِلْسِ: and by a secondary and predominant application, a mixture of quick lime<br>\
(كلس) with arsenic, or orpiment, (زِرْنِيخ,) and<br>\
other things, used for removing hair: (Msb:)<br>\
[a depilatory composed of quick lime with a<br>\
small proportion (about an eighth part) of orpiment: it is made into a paste with water, before<br>\
application; and loosens the hair in about two<br>\
minutes; after which it is immediately washed<br>\
off: thus made in the present day:] some say<br>\
that it is an Arabic word; and others, that it is<br>\
arabicized. (Msb) See 8.<br>\

نَيِّرٌ Giving light, shining, bright, or shining<br>\
brightly; (A, Msb;) as also ↓ مُنِيرٌ and ↓ مُسْتَنِيرٌ<br>\
(A) [and ↓ نَائِرٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Beautiful in colour, and bright;<br>\
as also ↓ مُنِيرٌ and ↓ أَنْوَرُ: (TA:) or the last<br>\
signifies [simply] beautiful; (K;) or conspicuous<br>\
and beautiful. (TA.) It is said of Mohammad.<br>\
 كَانَ أَنْوَرَ ↓ المُتَجَرَّدِ: He was beautiful and<br>\
bright in the colour [of what was unclad] of his<br>\
body. (TA.)<br>\
نَوُورٌ, (S, Msb, and so in some copies of the<br>\

(S, TA,) i. q. نِيلَجٌ [i. e. Indigo-pigment]; (S, K;)<br>\
or نِيلَنْجٌ; [which appears from what follows to<br>\
be the right reading, though both نيلج and<br>\
نيلنج are used in the present day for the purpose<br>\
described in explanations of نوور, to give a<br>\
greenish colour to the marks made in tatooing;]<br>\
(Msb;) i. e., (so accord. to the S and Msb; but<br>\
in the K, and) the smoke [meaning the smokeblack] of fat, (IAar, T, S, M, Msb, K,) that<br>\

punctures made in tatooing are dressed, (S, Msb,)<br>\

(S, Msb;) or with which the women of the Arabs<br>\
of the time of ignorance tattooed themselves:<br>\

to Lth, the smoke [or smoke-black] of the wick,<br>\
used as a collyrium or for tatooing; but, [says<br>\
Az,] I have not heard that the women of the<br>\
Arabs used this as a collyrium in the time of<br>\
ignorance nor in the time of El-Islám; their using<br>\
it for tatooing, however, is mentioned in their<br>\
poems: (T:) or lamp-black; the black pigment<br>\
(نِقْس) prepared from the smoke of the lamp;<br>\
used for tattooing. (Comm. on the Mo&#39;allakát,<br>\
printed at Calcutta, p. 143.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, A kind of<br>\
small stone, resembling إِثْمِد, which is bruised, or<br>\
