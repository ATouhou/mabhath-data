نَسَرَ, aor.<br>\
نَسُرَ (S, M, K) and<br>\
نَسِرَ, (M, K,) inf.<br>\
n. نَسْرٌ, (S, M, K,) He (a bird, M, K, or a hawk<br>\
or falcon, S, [or other bird, see نَسْرٌ below,])<br>\
plucked flesh (S, M, K) with his beak. (S, TA.)<br>\
You say also, نَسَرَهُ بِمِنْسَرِهِ, meaning, He (a hawk<br>\
or falcon [or other bird]) plucked his flesh with his<br>\
beak. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  [Hence,] نَسَرَهُ (tropical:)  He blamed him;<br>\
found fault with him; spoke evil of him behind his<br>\
back, or in his absence, saying of him what would<br>\
grieve him if he heard it. (A.)<br>\
10<br>\
استنسر He (the بَغَاث [or ignoble bird, or<br>\
most ignoble of birds,] S, M) became a نَسْر [or<br>\
vulture]: (M:) or became like the نَسْر (S, K) in<br>\
strength. (K.) Hence the proverb, إِنَّ البَغَاثَ<br>\
بِأَرْضِنَا يَسْتَنْسِرُ [Verily the most ignoble bird, or<br>\
most ignoble birds, in our land becomes like the<br>\
vulture, or become like vultures]: (S, M:) meaning,<br>\
the weak among us becomes strong. (S.) See<br>\
also art. بغث.<br>\
نَسْرٌ (S, M, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and sometimes ↓ نِسْرٌ<br>\
[agreeably with the modern general pronunciation]<br>\
and ↓ نُسْرٌ, (Sheykh-el-Islám Zekereeyà, in his<br>\
Comm. on the Expos. of Bd,) but this is very<br>\
strange, (MF,) [The vulture; app. any vulture,<br>\
whatever be its species or variety, known to the<br>\
Arabs, except the رَخَم, or aquiline vulture; and<br>\
said to be applied by some of the Arabs to the<br>\
eagle; (see also نُسَارِيَّةٌ;) agreeing with the<br>\
Hebrew<br>\
נֶשֶׁר, which is plainly applied to the<br>\
former bird in Micah, i. 16, and probably in other<br>\
instances;] a certain bird, (S, M, A, Msb, K,)<br>\
well known; (A, Msb;) so called because it<br>\
plucks (يَنْسُِرُ) a thing, and swallows it, (A, and<br>\
so in some copies of the K,) or, and pulls it out<br>\
(so in some copies of the K,) or, and chases and<br>\
captures it; (so in some copies of the K; the<br>\
various readings being وَيَبْتَلِعُهُ and وَيَقْتَلِعُهُ and<br>\
وَيَقْتَنِصُهُ;) it is said that it has no مِخْلَب [or<br>\
talon], but only the ظُفْر [or nail], like that of the<br>\
domestic cock and hen, and of the crow and the<br>\
like, and of the رَخَمَة [or aquiline vulture]: (S:)<br>\
the bird called in Persian كَرْكَشْ, which eats<br>\
carcases until it is unable to fly, and is said to live<br>\
a thousand years: (Kzw:) AHn asserts, that<br>\
the نسر is a bird of the description called عِتَاق;<br>\
[which is a term applied to birds of prey, and to<br>\
noble birds, (in a sense wider than that in which<br>\
this appellation is used in English falconry,) and<br>\
especially to eagles;] but [ISd says] I know not<br>\
how that is: (M:) pl. (of pauc., S) أَنْسُرٌ and (of<br>\
mult., S) نُسُورٌ. (S, M, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  النَّسْرُ الوَاقِعُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The Falling, or Alighting, Vulture,] and<br>\
النَّسْرُ الطَّائِرُ (assumed tropical:)  [The Flying Vulture,] are two stars<br>\
or asterisms, (S, * M, A, Msb, K,) well-known,<br>\
(M,) which together are called النَّسْرَانِ [the Two<br>\
Vultures], (M, A,) and each of which alone is<br>\
called النَّسْرُ (M, Msb, K) and نَسْرٌ; (M;) being<br>\
likened to the bird so named: (M:) the former is<br>\
the bright star [a] in the constellation الشَّلْيَاقُ [or<br>\
Lyra] likened by the Arabs to a vulture (نسر) that<br>\
has contracted its wings to itself, as though it had<br>\
alighted upon something: and the latter consists of<br>\
the three well-known stars [a and b and g] in the<br>\
constellation العُقَابُ [or Aquila]: (Kzw:) [The<br>\
former rose heliacally, about the epoch of the<br>\
Flight, in central Arabia, on the 25th of November, O. S., with the Eighteenth Mansion of the<br>\
Moon, which is a of Scorpio; and the latter, on<br>\
the 28th of December, O. S.: and both set, together, anti-heliacally, at that period and in that<br>\
part, on the 24th of July, O. S. See نَوْءٌ, and<br>\
دَبُورٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  نَسْرٌ (S, M, Msb) and النَّسْرُ, (S, M, K,)<br>\
the latter occurring in a verse cited in art. عز, (S,)<br>\
A certain idol, (S, M, Msb, K,) belonging to<br>\
Dhu-l-Kelaa, (S, Msb, K,) in the land of Himyer,<br>\
(S, K,) as يَغُوثُ did to Medhhij, and يَعُوقُ to Hemdán, of the idols of the people of Noah, (S,) all of<br>\
which are mentioned in the Kur, lxxii. 22 and 23:<br>\
(S, M:) or a certain good man, who lived between<br>\
Adam and Noah, and of whom, after his death,<br>\
was made an image, which, after a long time,<br>\
became an object of worship; like وَدٌّ and سُوَاعٌ and<br>\
يَغُوثُ, and يَعُوقُ, mentioned therewith in the Kur,<br>\
ubi supra. (Bd.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, نَسْرٌ [The frog, or<br>\
frush, of the hoof of a horse or ass or mule; thus<br>\
called in the present day;] a portion of tough<br>\
flesh, [or rather a horny substance,] in the بطْن<br>\
[or sole] of the solid hoof, as though it were a datestone, [which it resembles in substance,] or a<br>\
pebble: (S:) or the flesh of the solid hoof, which<br>\
the poets liken to date-stones: (T:) or a portion<br>\
of flesh, (K,) or of hard flesh, (M,) in the بَاطِن<br>\
[or sole, or inner part,] of the solid hoof, (M, K,<br>\
TA,) as though it were a pebble, or a date-stone,<br>\
(TA:) or what rises in the باطن of the hoof of the<br>\
horse, from, or of, the upper part thereof: (M,<br>\
K:) or the باطن itself of the solid hoof: (M:)<br>\
pl. نُسُورٌ, (M, K,) which Aboo-Sa&#39;eed explains<br>\
as signifying the prominences in the بَطْن [or sole]<br>\
of the solid hoof, which are likened to date-stones<br>\
because of their hardness, and which do not touch<br>\
the ground. (TA.) Hence the saying, حَافِرٌ صُلْبُ<br>\
النُّسُورِ [A solid hoof hard in the frog: the sing.<br>\
and pl. being used indiscriminately]. (TA.)<br>\
نُسْرٌ: see نَسْرٌ, first signification.<br>\
نِسْرٌ: see نَسْرٌ, first signification.<br>\
نِسْرِينٌ [The wild rose, dog-rose, eglantine, or<br>\
sweet brier: so in the present day: and, accord. to<br>\
Spreng., Hist. Rei Herb., cited by Freytag, the<br>\
jonquil:] a well-known rose; (K;) a well-known<br>\
sweet-smelling flower; (Msb;) a species of sweetsmelling flower; (M;) a Persian word, (M, Msb,)<br>\
arabicized: (Msb:) of the measure فِعْلِيل; and,<br>\
if so, the [final] ن is radical: or of the measure<br>\
فِعلِينٌ; and if so, that letter is augmentative:<br>\
Az says, I know not whether it be Arabic or not.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
نُسَارِيَّةٌ The eagle; syn. عُقَابٌ: (IAar, K:)<br>\
likened to the نَسْر. (IAar, TA.) [Hence it<br>\
appears that, accord. to IAar, the نَسْر is not the<br>\
eagle.]<br>\
نَاسُورٌ (also written with ص, S, Msb,) A certain<br>\
disease that happens in the inner angles of the<br>\
eyes, (S, Msb, K,) with an incessant defluxion<br>\
therefrom: (S, TA:) and sometimes it happens<br>\
also in the part around the anus: and in the gum:<br>\
(S, Msb:) or it signifies also a certain disease in<br>\
the part around the anus: and a certain disease<br>\
in the gum: (K:) and is an arabicized word<br>\
[from the Persian]: (S, Msb:) نَوَاصِير, pl. of<br>\
نَاصُورٌ, accord. to certain of the physicians, is a<br>\
term applied to deep ulcers in the anus, at the<br>\
extremity of the gut. (Msb, art. نصر.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, A vein constantly becoming recrudescent,<br>\
(عِرْقٌ غَبِرٌ,) with an incessant defluxion; (S, K;) corrupt within; whenever its upper part heals, breaking forth again with corruption. (TA.) See also<br>\
غَرْبٌ.<br>\
مِنْسَرٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ مَنْسِرٌ, (Msb, K,) or<br>\
the former only, (AZ,) The beak of a bird (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K) of prey; (S, Msb;) or of a hawk or<br>\
falcon; (A;) that of any other bird being called<br>\
مِنْقَارٌ. (S, Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  [Hence,] ↓ both words also<br>\
signify (assumed tropical:)  A portion of an army that goes before<br>\
the main army: (S, K:) [likened to the beak of<br>\
a bird of prey; as the side bodies are likened to<br>\
the wings:] and a troop of horse or horsemen in<br>\
number from thirty to forty: or from forty to<br>\
fifty: or from forty to sixty: (M, K:) or from a<br>\
hundred to two hundred: (M, Msb, K:) or a<br>\
troop of horse or horsemen: (El-Farábee, Msb:)<br>\
or an army that does not pass by anything without<br>\
snatching it away. (Msb.)<br>\
