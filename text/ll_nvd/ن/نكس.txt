inverted it; reversed it; changed its manner of<br>\
being, or state: (Sh, Msb: *) he turned it over<br>\
upon its head: (S, A, K:) and he turned it fore<br>\
part behind; made the first part of it to be last;<br>\
or put the first part of it last: (Sh:) and<br>\
↓ نكّسهُ, (S, A, K) inf. n. تَنْكِيسٌ, (S,) signifies<br>\
the same; (S, * A, K;) or has an intensive sense.<br>\
(TA.) You say, نُكِسَ السَّهْمُ فِى الكِنَانَةِ The<br>\
arrow was turned, or put, upside down in the<br>\
quiver. (TA.) And it is said in the Kur,<br>\
[xxxvi. 68,] وَمَنْ نُعَمِّرْهُ نَنْكُسْهُ فِى الخَلْقِ, or,<br>\
accord. to the reading of &#39;Ásim and Hamzeh,<br>\
↓ نُنَكِّسْهُ; meaning, And him whom We cause to<br>\
live long, We cause him to become in a state the<br>\
reverse of that in which he was, in constitution;<br>\
so that after strength, he becomes reduced to<br>\
weakness; and after youthfulness, to extreme old<br>\
age. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَكَسْتُ فُلَانًا فِى ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  I<br>\
made such a one to enter again into that affair,<br>\
or state, after he had got out of it. (ISh.)<br>\
[Hence the saying in the Kur, xxi. 66,] ثُمَّ<br>\
نُكِسُوا عَلَى رُؤُوسِهِمْ (assumed tropical:)  Then they were made to<br>\
return to their disbelief: (Jel:) or (tropical:)  then they<br>\
reverted to disputation, after they had taken the<br>\
right course by means of consulting together;<br>\
their return to falsity being likened to a thing&#39;s<br>\
becoming upside down: and there are two other<br>\
readings; ↓ نُكِّسُوا, and نَكَسُوا; the latter meaning نَكَسُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ: (Bd;) or (assumed tropical:)  then they reverted<br>\
from what they knew, of the evidence in favour<br>\
of Abraham. (Fr.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence,] نَكَسَهُ, and<br>\
نَكَسَهُ إِلَى مَرَضِهِ, (tropical:)  It made him to fall back into<br>\
his disease.] (TA, in art. هيض.) And نُكِسَ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) or نُكِسَ فِى مَرَضِهِ, (A, TA,) inf. n.<br>\

is said of this below]) and نُكَاسٌ, (Sh, K,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
relapsed into his disease, after convalescence, or<br>\
after recovery, but not complete, of health and<br>\

he were made to turn back to it. (Msb.) You<br>\
say, أَكَلَ كَذَا فَنُكِسَ (tropical:)  [He ate such a thing,<br>\
and relapsed into his disease]. (A, TA.) And<br>\
تَعْسًا لَهُ وَنُكْسًا, and sometimes one says, نَكْسًا, (S,<br>\
K,) in this case, (S,) for the sake of mutual resemblance, (S, K,) or because نَكْسًا is a dial form<br>\
[of نُكْسًا], (S,) [meaning, (assumed tropical:)  May he fall upon his<br>\
face, or the like, (see art. تعس,) and relapse into<br>\
disease: or] may he fall upon his face, and not<br>\
rise after his fall until he fall a second time: and<br>\
in like manner you say, ↓ تَعَسَ وَانْتَكَسَ. (Msb, art.<br>\
تعس.) [See also 8.] You say also, نُكِسَ الجُرْحُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The wound broke open again; or became<br>\
recrudescent]. (S, in arts. عرب and حبط, &amp;c.)<br>\

like عُنِىَ, (assumed tropical:)  He fell short of his fellows; was<br>\
unable to attain to them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  نَكَسَ رَأْسَهُ,<br>\
and ↓ نكّسهُ, (TA,) [and نَكَسَ alone, (see نَاكِسٌ,)]<br>\
and ↓ نكّس, (L, TA, art. بقر,) and ↓ انتكس,<br>\
(TA,) [and in like manner ↓ تنكّس, said of a<br>\
flower-stalk in the M and K, voce قِشْبٌ,] He<br>\
bent, or inclined, his head; (TA;) he lowered,<br>\
or stooped, his head; bent, or hung, it down<br>\

head; became inverted; became reversed; became<br>\
changed in its manner of being, or state; it became<br>\
turned fore part behind; its first part was made to<br>\

This last signification [understood figuratively]<br>\
it is said to have in the phrase تَعَسَ وَانْتَكَسَ, a<br>\
form of imprecation, meaning, (assumed tropical:)  May he be disappointed, or fail, of attaining his desire: for he<br>\
who is overthrown in his affair (مَن انْتَكَسَ فِى<br>\
أَمْرِهِ) is disappointed of attaining his desire, and<br>\
suffers loss. (TA.) [See also 1, where this<br>\
form of imprecation is differently explained.] ―<br>\

but يَتْنٌ is an inf. n., and I have not found it<br>\

but he says that it is not of established authority.<br>\

12;) and sometimes] نَوَاكِسُ, (S, K,) used [only]<br>\
in poetry, (S, TA,) by reason of necessity, (TA,)<br>\
and anomalous, (S, K,) like فَوَارِسُ. (S.) ElFarezdak says,<br>\
وَإِذَا الرِّجَالُ رَأَوْا يَزِيدَ رَأَيْتَهُم<br>\
خُضُعَ الرِّقَابِ نَوَاكِسَ الأَبْصَارِ<br>\
[And when the men see Yezeed, thou seest them<br>\
depressed in the necks, lowering the eyes]: (S:)<br>\
thus the verse is related by Fr and Ks: Akh<br>\
says, that it is allowable to say نَوَاكِسِ الأَبْصَارِ,<br>\
after the manner of the phrase حُجْرُ ضَبٍّ خَرِبٍ;<br>\
[see art. خرب;] and Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà adds<br>\
ى in relating it; saying نَوَاكِسِى الأَبْصَارِ. (TA.)<br>\

reached the other horses (Lth, K) in their heat,<br>\
or single run to a goal; (Lth;) i. e., by reason<br>\
of his weakness and impotence; as also ↓ نِكْسٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
وَلَدٌ مَنْكُوسٌ A child [preposterously brought<br>\
forth; whose feet come forth before his head.<br>\
(A, Msb, and so in a copy of the S.) See<br>\
also نِكْسٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  وِلَادٌ مَنْكُوسٌ [Preposterous childbirth] is when the feet come forth before the<br>\
head; (K, and so in a copy of the S, [and that<br>\
this is what was meant by the author of the S<br>\
seems to be indicated by what immediately follows]) i. q. يَتْنُ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  طَوَافٌ مَنْكُوسٌ A<br>\
circuiting of the Kaabeh performed in a way<br>\

the Kur-án, beginning from the last part thereof,<br>\
(K,) i. e. from [the commencement of the latter<br>\
of] the مُعَوِّذَتَانِ [or last two chapters], (TA,)<br>\
and ending with the فَاتِحَة [or first chapter];<br>\
contrary to the prescribed mode: (TA:) or<br>\
beginning from the end of the chapter, and<br>\
reading it, or reciting it, to its beginning, invertedly; (K;) a mode which A &#39;Obeyd thinks<br>\
impossible; and therefore he holds the former<br>\
explanation to be the right: (TA:) each of<br>\
these practices is disapproved, excepting the<br>\
former in teaching children, [in which case it is<br>\
generally adopted in the present day,] (K,) and<br>\
[in teaching] the foreigner the [portion of the<br>\
Kur-án called the] مُفَصَّل; an indulgence being<br>\
granted to these two only because the long<br>\
chapters are difficult to them: but if any one<br>\
knows the Kur-án by heart, and intentionally<br>\
recite it from the last part thereof to the first,<br>\
this is forbidden: and if we disapprove this,<br>\
still more is the reciting from the end of the<br>\
chapter to the beginning disapproved, if the doing<br>\
this be possible. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  مَنْكُوسٌ also signifies<br>\
(tropical:)  Suffering a relapse into disease, after convalescence; or after recovery, but not complete, of<br>\
health and strength. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  مَنْكُوسَةٌ applied to<br>\
a bow: see نِكْسٌ.<br>\
