verbs, of which the last seems to be the most<br>\
common, signifies, as is implied in the L &amp;c., and<br>\
accord. to present usage, he made a reiterated<br>\
humming in his throat, like a slight coughing, or,<br>\
as some say, more violent than coughing; as is<br>\
often done by a niggard when he is asked for a<br>\
thing:] التَّنَحْنُحُ is well known, (S,) and النَّحْنَحَةُ<br>\
is like it; (Lth, S;) it is [the making a sound,<br>\
or sounds, in the throat,] slighter than coughing;<br>\
and is the pretence of the niggard: (Lth:) or it<br>\
is more violent than coughing; as also النَّحِيحُ.<br>\

the latter word is an imitative sequent: (S, K:)<br>\
or it is a corroborative syn. of the former: (MF:)<br>\
as though meaning one who when asked for<br>\
something, disliking to give it, has recourse to a<br>\
pretence, and makes a reiterated breathing [or<br>\
humming in his throat] as a feint to hide his<br>\
unwillingness. (L.) [See also نَحَانِحَةٌ.]<br>\
