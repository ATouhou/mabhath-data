He (a man, S, Msb) took it (namely flesh or flesh-meat) with his fore teeth, (S, A, Msb, K,) to eat<br>\
it, (Msb,) and plucked it off; (A, K;) as also<br>\
↓ انتهسهُ: (S:) and he ate it off from a bone<br>\
(تَعَرَّقَهُ) with his fore teeth: (Lh, TA:) or he<br>\
pulled it off with the central incisors, to eat it:<br>\
(TA:) and he took it with the fore part of his<br>\
mouth; as also ↓ انتهسهُ: (A:) or he took it<br>\
with his mouth: (IAth, TA:) or he took it with<br>\
his mouth to bite it and make a mark upon it<br>\
without wounding it: (TA, art. نهش:) and he<br>\
(a dog, and any animal having a canine tooth,)<br>\
bit it: or seized it, and then pulled it, or pulled<br>\
it vehemently, or rent it with his teeth: but there<br>\
is a difference of opinion respecting this verb in<br>\
all its significations: some say that it is with the<br>\
unpointed س; and thus, only, it is mentioned<br>\
by ISk, who says, I heard El-Kilábee say, of a<br>\
dog and of a wolf and of a serpent, ↓ انتهسهُ<br>\
and نَهَسَهُ; (Msb;) [and J says, the نَهْس of<br>\
the serpent is the same as its نَهْش; (S;) you<br>\
say نَهَسَتْهُ الحَيَّةُ in the sense of نَهَشَتْهُ [the<br>\
serpent bit him]: (Z, Sgh:) others say that the<br>\
verbs are with س and ش throughout; and thus<br>\
says IF on the authority of As: Az cites Lth<br>\
as saying that نَهْشٌ, with the pointed ش, signifies<br>\
taking, or reaching, from a distance, like the<br>\
نهش of the serpent; and نَهْسٌ, with the unpointed<br>\
letter, the seizing upon flesh, or flesh-meat, and<br>\
pulling it, or pulling it vehemently, or rending it<br>\
with the teeth: Th says that the latter is with<br>\
the extremities of the teeth; and the former, with<br>\
the teeth [absolutely], and with [those that are<br>\
termed] the أَضْرَاس: IKoot says, like Lth, that<br>\
one says of the serpent (الحَيَّة), نَهَشَتْهُ, with the<br>\
pointed ش; and of the dog and wolf and hyena,<br>\
نَهَسَهُ, with the unpointed letter. (Msb.)<br>\
