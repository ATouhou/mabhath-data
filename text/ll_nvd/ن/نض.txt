استنضّ الثِّمَادَ He sought repeatedly and<br>\
perseveringly the [small quantities, or remains,<br>\
termed] ثِمَاد of water, and took of them little by<br>\
little. (TA [in which, however, الثِّمَارَ is erroneously put for الثِّمَادَ].) ―<br>\

نَضْنَضَ, (K, TA,) or ↓ نَضَّضُ, (so in<br>\
the CK,) said of a man, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  His نَاضّ, (K,<br>\
TA,) i. e. what was apparent of his property,<br>\
(TA,) became much, or abundant. (K, TA.)<br>\

He moved about his tongue; as also تَصْنَصَ; but<br>\
the ض in the former is not a substitute for the<br>\
ص in the latter, as some assert it to be: (L,<br>\
TA:) the verb is used in this sense in speaking of a man; (TA:) and of a serpent; (S *,<br>\
A, K;) inf. n. نَضْنَضَةٌ: (S, but in one copy<br>\
نَضِيضَةٌ:) and accord. to Ibn-&#39;Abbád, نَضْنَضَةٌ [the<br>\
inf. n.] signifies the making, or uttering, of a<br>\
sound: or the sound itself; (صَوْت;) [app. by a<br>\
motion of the tongue;] of the serpent; and hence,<br>\
[accord. to some,] the epithet نَضْنَاضٌ, as applied<br>\
to a serpent: (TA:) or this epithet is from the<br>\
phrase, (IAar.) نَصْنَضَ فُلَانًا, (IAar, K,) ↓ نَضَّضَهُ,<br>\
(so in the CK,) He put such a one in motion,<br>\
(IAar,) and he disquieted, disturbed, or unsettled,<br>\
him; or removed him from his place. (IAar,<br>\
K.) [In one place, in the TA, اسنضّ مِنْهُ شَيْئًا<br>\
is made to signify the same; but this is doubtless<br>\
a mistake, arising from an omission in transcription.] You say also, نَضْنَضَ البَعِيرُ ثَفنَاته The<br>\
camel moved about his ثَفِنَات [q. v.], and made<br>\
them to be in contact with the ground; or this is<br>\
[نَصْنَصَ,] with ص. (TA.)<br>\

نَضٌّ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ ناضٌّ (S, A, Mgh,<br>\

are called المَال ↓ نَاضٌّ: (A, TA:) or the dirhem<br>\
and deenár: (K:) of the dial. of El-Hijáz:<br>\
(As, S, Mgh, Msb:) but accord. to A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
(S, Msb,) or As, (TA,) these are called ↓ نَاضٌّ<br>\
only when converted into such after having been<br>\
a commodity, or commodities; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
because one says, مَا نَضَّ بِيَدِى مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) i. e. مَا حَصَلَ: (Msb:) نَضٌّ also signifies<br>\
what is apparent, or produced, or prepared, or<br>\
ready; and so ↓ نَاضٌّ, particularly of property:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ the latter, what has continuance,<br>\
or endurance, of property, (Msb.) A man of<br>\
much property is described as being أَكْثَرُ النَّاسِ<br>\
↓ نَاضًّا (tropical:)  [The most abounding of men in gold and<br>\
silver coin]. (TA.)<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  A man having little flesh; (K;) as also ↓ نَضُّهُ,<br>\
and ↓ نَضْنَاضُهُ. (TA.)<br>\

and ↓ نَضِيضَتِهِمْ, They came with the most remote<br>\
of their company; (O, K;) from Ibn-&#39;Abbád.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
نُضَاضَةٌ A remainder, (S, K,) or small remainder, (A,) of water, (S, A, K,) &amp;c.: (S, K:)<br>\
the last thereof: pl. نَضَائِصُ and نِضَاضٌ. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence,] نُضَاضَةُ وَلَدِ الرَّجُلِ (tropical:)  The last of the<br>\
children of the man: (AZ, S, A, K:) applied<br>\

or a weak rain: or a weak cloud: or one flowing<br>\
with water: (TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَنِضَّةٌ and [of<br>\
mult.] نَضَائِضُ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A wind that brings<br>\
rain. (تَنِضُّ بِالْمَآءِ,) so that it flows: or a weak<br>\
wind. (A &#39;Obeyd, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  لقَدٌ تَرَكْثِ الإِبِلُ المَآءَ<br>\
وَهِىَ ذَاتُ نَضِيضَةٍ, and ذَاتُ نَضَائِضَ, The camels<br>\
have left the water, having thirst; (S, K.; *)<br>\
not having satisfied their thirst. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  The<br>\
sound of the roasting of flesh-meat upon heated<br>\
stones: pl. نَضَائِضُ: (S, K:) ISd, however, says,<br>\
I think that نَضَائضُ is a sing., like خَشَارِمُ; but<br>\
the sing. may be نَضِيضَةٌ. (TA.) [It seems to<br>\
me not improbable that نَضَائِضُ may in a mistranscription, for نَضَائِضُ, pl. of the inf. n. نَضْنَضَةٌ<br>\
used as a subst.]<br>\
-A3-  See also نَضِيضٌ.<br>\
نَضْنَاضٌ: see نَضِيضٌ.<br>\
-A2-  حَيَّةٌ نَضْنَاضٌ, (IAar,<br>\
S, K,) and نَضْنَاضَةٌ, (S, A, K,) A serpent that<br>\
remains not still in a place, (IAar, K,) by reason<br>\
of its malignity and liveliness: (IAar:) or that,<br>\
when it bites, kills immediately: (K:) or that<br>\
moves about its tongue, (S, A, K,) having put it<br>\
forth; (K;) as also with ص: [see نَصْنَاصٌ:]<br>\
(TA:) or that utters a sound, or sounds. (TA.)<br>\
It is said that Dhu-r-Rummeh, being asked<br>\
respecting the meaning of نَضْناضٌ, did nothing<br>\
more than move about his tongue in his mouth;<br>\
(S:) or put forth his tongue, and move it about,<br>\
(IJ, O,) in his mouth, making a sign with it to<br>\
him who asked him. (O.)<br>\
نَضْنَاضَةٌ: see فَضْفَاضَةٌ.<br>\
