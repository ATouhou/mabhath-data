mult.] نُمُوسٌ. (Msb.) You say, فِى النَّاسِ أَنْمَاسٌ<br>\

artifice, or expedient, by which a man conceals<br>\

app., تُنُمّسَ is a mistake for تَنَّمِسُ:]) deceit; guile;<br>\
circumvention. (A, TA.) You say, فُلَانٌ صَاحِبُ<br>\
نَامُوسٍ, and نَوَامِيسَ, Such a one is a person of<br>\

in post classical writings, A man&#39;s honour, or<br>\

-b7-  A confidant; one<br>\

private affairs, of a good nature: (K, TA:)<br>\
and جَاسُوسٌ signifies one who possesses, or is<br>\
acquainted with, secrets, or private affairs of<br>\
an evil nature. (TA.) [The author of the Mgh<br>\
thinks that the second of the significations mentioned above, i. e. “ revelation,” is derived from<br>\
this; a prefixed noun [such as كِتَاب, perhaps,]<br>\
being understood.] Hence, (Mgh,) النّامُوسُ,<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, S, M, Msb, K,) or النَّامُوسُ الأَكْبَرُ,<br>\
(A, TA,) is applied to [The angel] Gabriel;<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, S, M, A, &amp;c.) by the people of the<br>\

[says ISd] I know not. (M.) ―<br>\

syn. شَرَكٌ: (K:) because it is concealed beneath<br>\
