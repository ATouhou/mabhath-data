and ↓ أَنْهَرَ it (blood) flowed (K, TA) like a river:<br>\
(TA:) and the latter also, it (a vein) flowed and<br>\
would not stop; (K, TA;) meaning, it flowed<br>\
like a river; (TA;) as also ↓ انتهر: (Sgh, K,<br>\
TA:) and ↓ انهر also signifies the same said of<br>\
the belly; (TA;) or it (the belly) became loose,<br>\
or relaxed; or it discharged itself; (JK;) as<br>\

-A2-  نَهَرَ, (S, K.) aor.<br>\

addressed him with chiding speech, (JK, A,) forbidding him from doing evil. (JK. [in the TA,<br>\
citing the last explanation from the T, عَنْ خَيْرٍ is<br>\
erroneously put for عَنْ شَرٍّ.]) It is said in the<br>\
Kur, [xciii. 10,] وَأَمَّا السَّائِلَ فَلَا تَنْهَرْ [And as for<br>\
the beggar, thou shalt not chide him, or address<br>\
him with rough speech]. And in a trad., مَنِ انْتَهَرَ<br>\

انهر: see 1. in three places.<br>\
-A2-  (tropical:)  He made<br>\
blood to flow: (S:) or to appear and flow: (K:)<br>\
or to flow amply and copiously: (Mgh:) or to<br>\
flow with force: (Msb:) or he poured it forth<br>\
copiously. (TA.) It is said in a trad., أَنْهِرِ الدَّمَ<br>\
بِمَا شِئْتَ إِلَّا مَا كَانَ مِنْ سِنِّ أَوْ ظُفُرٍ [Make thou<br>\
the blood to flow, &amp;c., with what thou pleasest,<br>\
except with what is made of a tooth or a talon.]<br>\
(Mgh, Msb.) The issuing forth of the blood<br>\
from the place of slaughter is likened to the<br>\
flowing of water in a river. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
made it wide; (S, K;) namely, a spear-wound<br>\

in day-time: (S, * K, * TA:) he entered upon<br>\
day-time: (MS:) from النَّهَارُ. (S.)<br>\

إِنْتَهَرَ see 1, in five places.<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَنْهَرَ see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  It (a river [in the CK النَّهْرَ is<br>\
put by mistake for النَّهْرُ]) took a place, (JK,) or<br>\
a settle place, (K,) for its channel. (JK, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  It (a thing) became wide. (S.)<br>\
نَهْرٌ and ↓ نَهَرٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) A channel<br>\
in which water runs: (A, K:) so most say: or<br>\
the water itself [that runs therein; i. e., a river;<br>\
a rivulet; a brook; a canal of running water]:<br>\
(TA:) or a wide channel in which water runs:<br>\
originally, the water [that runs therein]: (Mgh:)<br>\
or properly, wide running water: and by a secondary application, which is tropical. (tropical:)  the trench<br>\
or channel [in which it runs]: (Msb, TA *:) pl.<br>\
[of pauc.] أَنْهُرٌ, (Msb, K,) a pl. of the former,<br>\
(Msb,) and أَنْهَارٌ, (S, Msb, K,) a pl. of the latter,<br>\
(Msb,) [but used as a pl. of either, both of pauc.<br>\
and of mult. and the most common of all the<br>\
pls.,] and نُهُرٌ, (Msb, and so in some copies of the<br>\
K,) with two dammehs, a pl. of the former,<br>\
(Msb,) or نُهْرٌ, (as in some copies of the K and in<br>\
the TA,) and نُهُورٌ, (IAar, K.) You say, جَرَى<br>\
النَّهْرُ [The river ran, or flowed]; like as you say,<br>\
جَرَى المِيزَابُ. (Msb.) And نَهْرٌ كَثِير المَآءِ [A<br>\
channel of running water having much water].<br>\
(A.) And ↓ نَهَرٌ is also used in a pl. sense: as in<br>\
the Kur, [liv. 54], فِى جَنَّاتٍ وَنَهَرٍ [In gardens<br>\
and among rivers], i. e., أَنْهَارِ; like the phrase in<br>\
the Kur, (same chap. verse 45,] وَيُوَلُّونَ الدُّبْرَ,<br>\
(Fr, S.) meaning الأَدْبَارَ, (Fr, TA:) but it is<br>\
otherwise explained. (S.) See نَهَرٌ below.<br>\
نَهَرٌ: see نَهْرٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Amplitude:<br>\
(K:) or light and amplitude: so, accord. to<br>\
some, in the Kur, liv. 54, differently explained<br>\
above: see نَهْرٌ, (S, TA.) or, accord. to Th, نَهَر<br>\
is a pl. [or rather quasi pl.] of نُهُرٌ, which is a pl.<br>\
of نهَارٌ. (TA.)<br>\
نَهِرٌ Much, (TA;) as also ↓ نَهيرٌ; (K, TA;)<br>\
both applied to water. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A wide نَهْر [or<br>\
river, or channel in which water runs]. (K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
رَخُلٌ نَهِرٌ A man of day-time; syn. صَاحِبُ نَهَارٍ;<br>\
(S, K;) who makes inroads or incursions into the<br>\
territories of enemies therein: (S:) or who works<br>\
therein: (A:) a kind of rel. n.; as is shown by<br>\
the ex.<br>\
لَسْتُ بِلَيْلِىٍّ وَلٰكِنِّى نهِرٌ<br>\
لَا أُدْلِجُ اللَّيْلَ وَلٰكِنْ أَبْتَكِرْ<br>\
[I am not one of the night-time, but I am one of<br>\
the day-time; I do not journey in the night, but<br>\
I go forth early in the morning]: as though he<br>\
said ↓ نَهَارِىّ. (Sb.) The verse is correctly related as above; not as it is given in the S. (IB.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also أَنْهَرُ.<br>\
نَهَارٌ Day; or day-time; contr. of لَيْلٌ: (S,<br>\
TA:) or broad daylight, (Mgh,) from sunrise to<br>\
sunset: (Mgh, Msb, K:) this is the original signification: (TA;) or this is the signification in<br>\
the vulgar conventional language: but in the<br>\
classical language it signifies the time from the<br>\
rising of the dawn to sunset: (Msb:) or the light<br>\
between the rising of the dawn and sunset: (K:)<br>\
and so accord. to the lawyers: (TA:) in the<br>\
trads., it is the whiteness of the نهار, and the<br>\
blackness of the ليل; and there is nothing intervening between the ليل and the نهار: but sometimes the Arabs amplified, and applied نهار to the<br>\
time from the clear shining of the dawn to the<br>\
setting [of the sun]: (Msb.) or (so accord. to the<br>\
TA. but in some copies of the K, and the<br>\
spreading of the light [which is a cause] of sight<br>\
and its dispersion: (K:) in this explanation in<br>\
the L, in the place of وَافْتِرَاقُهُ we find وَاجْتِمَاعُهُ<br>\
[and its collecting together]: (TA:) it is also syn.<br>\
with يَوْمٌ; and is so when used without restriction<br>\
in the non-fundamental sciences of religion,<br>\
(الفُرُوع,) as in the phrases صُمْ نَهَارًا [fast thou a<br>\
day] and إِعْمَلْ نَهَارًا [work thou a day]: and it<br>\
may be so used, or in its proper classical sense,<br>\
when prefixed to يَوْم, governing the latter in the<br>\
gen. case: (Msb:) it has no proper dual, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) and no proper pl., (S, Mgh, Msb, K, (like<br>\
عَذَابٌ and سَرَابٌ; (S, K;) the former of which,<br>\
however, has a pl. assigned to it [by Zj and] in<br>\
the K, namely, أَعْذِبَةٌ; (MF;) [and respecting<br>\
the latter see شَرَابٌ, with ش;] [for] نهار is a name<br>\
applied to every يَوْم [or day]; and لَيْلٌ, to every<br>\
لَيْلَة [or night]: one does not say نَهَارٌ وَنَهَارَانِ, nor<br>\
لَيْلٌ وَلَيْلَانِ: but the sing. of نهار is يَوْمٌ (TA.)<br>\
and the dual, يَوْمَانِ, (Msb, TA:) and the pl.,<br>\
أَيَّامٌ. (Msb:) and the contr. of يوْمٌ is لَيْلَةٌ, so<br>\
says Az, on the authority of AH(??) (TA:) or<br>\
it has pls.: namely, أَنْهُرٌ, (IAar, S, K,) a pl. of<br>\
pauc., (S,) in some lexicons أَنْهِرَةٌ, (TA,) also a<br>\
pl. of pauc.,] and نُهُرٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) a pl. of<br>\
mult. (S) [See also نَهَرٌ.] Ibn-Keys(??) cites<br>\
the following ex.,<br>\
لَوْلَا الثَّرِيدَان لَمُتْنَا بِالضُّمُرْ<br>\
ثَرِيدُ لَيْلٍ وَثرِيدٌ بِالنَّهُرْ<br>\
[Were it not for the two thereeds (or messes of<br>\
crumbled bread moistened with broth), we had died<br>\
of leanness: the thereed of night, and thereed in<br>\
the day-times]. (S.)<br>\
نَهِيرٌ: see نَهِرٌ.<br>\
نَهَارِىٌّ: see نَهِرٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Food that is eaten in the<br>\
beginning of the day. (TA.)<br>\
نَهَارٌ أَنْهَرُ, and ↓ نَهرٌ, [A bright day:] in each of<br>\
these phrases the epithet has an intensive effect,<br>\
(K, * TA,) as the epithet in لَيْلٌ أَلْيَلُ. (TA.)<br>\
مَنْهَرٌ The place of a river. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A<br>\
place which the water hollows out in a نَهْر [or<br>\
channel of a river]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A cleft, (K, TA,)<br>\
or hole, (TA,) in a fortress, passing through [the<br>\
wall], whence water runs. (K, TA,) or by which<br>\
water enters: (TA:) pl. مَنَاهِرُ. (TA.)<br>\
