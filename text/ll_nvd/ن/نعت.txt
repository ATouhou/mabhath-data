possessed; whereas, in the وَصْف of a thing one<br>\
may exaggerate: (L;) (??) distinguished a person<br>\
or a thing by an epithet: and hence, he qualified<br>\
a substantive by an epithet: and he used a word<br>\
as an epithet] or he described a thing by mentioning what was in it that was good, or goodly; not<br>\
with reference to what was bad. or foul, or ugly;<br>\
unless by a straining of the meaning one say<br>\
نَعْتٌ سَوْءٌ; whereas وَصَفَ is said with respect to<br>\
what is good, or goodly and what is bad, or foul,<br>\

by mentioning the make, or form, or other outward<br>\

something in some particular place in the body,<br>\
