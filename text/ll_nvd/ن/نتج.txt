نَتَجَ, (S, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
نَتُجَ, (as in the L, [but<br>\
I believe this to be a mistake,]) or<br>\
نَتِجَ, (accord. to<br>\
the Msb, MS, MF,) inf. n. نَتْجٌ; (S;) and ↓ انتج;<br>\
(A;) He assisted a she-camel, (S, K, &amp;c.,) [and<br>\
a mare, see نُتِجَتْ,] and a ewe or she-goat (Msb)<br>\
[or other quadruped], in bringing forth; delivered<br>\
her of her young one; acting to her as a midwife<br>\
does to a woman. (T, Msb, &amp;c.) The original<br>\
form of expression is نَتَجَهَا وَلَدًا He assisted her<br>\
in bringing forth a young one; delivered her of a<br>\
young one. (Msb.) El-Kumeyt has used the<br>\
form ↓ اِنْتَتَجَ in the sense of نَتَجَ: but it is not<br>\
commonly current in Arabic. (TA.) AHn<br>\
mentions the saying النَّاسُ ↓ إِذَا نَآءَتِ الجَبْهَةُ نَتَّجُ<br>\
وَوَلَّدُوا وَاجْتُنِىَ أَوَّلُ الكَمْأَةِ [When El-Jebhah (the<br>\
tenth of the Mansions of the Moon) sets antiheliacally, (for the setting, not the rising, is here<br>\
meant, and this it did, about the commencement<br>\
of the era of the Flight, in central Arabia, on the<br>\
11th of February,) the people assist their beasts,<br>\
much, or frequently, in bringing forth, and deliver<br>\
them, and the first of the truffles are gathered].<br>\
Thus he relates the saying, with teshdeed to the<br>\
ث of نتج, to denote frequency of the act. (L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  نُتِجَتْ, pass. in form, [but neut. in signification,] inf. n. نِتَاجٌ (S, K, &amp;c.) and تَنْجٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ أُنْتِجَتْ, (K,) also pass. in form; and some<br>\
say نَتَجَتْ, but this is rare, and not heard by<br>\
IAar; (TA;) and some, also, say ↓ أَنْتَجَتْ,<br>\
(Lth, Kr,) but Az holds this to be a mistake;<br>\
(TA;) She (a camel, IAar, S, K, &amp;c., and a<br>\
mare, IAar, and a sheep or goat or other<br>\
quadruped, Msb) brought forth: (T, Msb, TA:)<br>\
or one does not say نُتِجَتِ الشَّاةُ unless a man<br>\
assist at the bringing forth. (Lth.) Thus one<br>\
suppresses the objective complement of the verb.<br>\
And one also says تُنِجَتِ النَّاقَةُ وَلَدًا The she-camel<br>\
brought forth a young one: and in like manner<br>\
one says of a ewe or a she-goat: and sometimes,<br>\
with the same meaning, نَتَجَتِ الناقة ولدا, in the<br>\
act. form. (Msb.) One also says الإِبِلُ ↓ تَنَاتَجَتِ<br>\
The camels brought forth. (A.) [You say,]<br>\
نَتَجَ القَوْمُ, (Lth,) and ↓ أَنْتَجَ, (L,) The people&#39;s<br>\
camels or sheep or goats brought forth: (Lth, L:)<br>\
or ↓ أَنْتَجُوا they had pregnant camels bringing<br>\
forth. (K.) One may also say نُتِجَ الوَلَدُ,<br>\
meaning The young one of a she-camel &amp;c., [see<br>\
نُتِجَتْ, above,] was brought forth, or born. (Msb.)<br>\
See 4. ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] الرِّيحُ تُنْتِجُ السَّحَابَ (tropical:)  [The<br>\
wind assists the clouds in the discharging of their<br>\
rain; i. e., draws forth the rain from the clouds.<br>\
(A, L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [نُتِجَ It was produced, it resulted, or<br>\
was a natural consequence.]<br>\

أَنْتَجَتْ She (a camel, S, and a mare, S, K,<br>\
or other solid-hoofed animal, Msb,) became pregnant: (T:) and so ↓ نَتَجَتْ, said of a she-camel,<br>\
(Msb,) or other beast; but this is rare: (EsSarakustee, Msb:) or attained to the time of<br>\
bringing forth: (S, K:) or became evidently<br>\
pregnant: (Yaakoob, S, Msb:) accord. to IAar,<br>\
أُنْتِجَتْ, in the pass. form, signifies she (a mare,<br>\
and a camel,) became near to the time of bringing<br>\
forth; and he had not heard أَنْتَجَتْ, in the act.<br>\
form. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See 1 and 8. ―<br>\
-b3-  أَنْتَجَ or أُنْتِجَ (?)<br>\

their result, poverty. (A, L.) And هٰذِهِ المُقَدِّمَةُ<br>\
