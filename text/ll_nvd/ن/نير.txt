نِيرٌ The عَلَم [or ornamental border] of a piece<br>\
of cloth: (T, S, M, A, K:) pl. أَنْيَارٌ. (M, K)<br>\
It is related that &#39;Omar disliked it, (TA,) and<br>\
that he forbade it. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (tropical:)  The<br>\
side (طُرَّة) of a road: (T:) or the side (جَانِب)<br>\
and wide or widening part (صَدْر), of a road.<br>\
(so in some copies of the K, and in the TA: but<br>\
in some copies of the former, “or ” is put in the<br>\
place of “ and: ”) or the conspicuous part of a<br>\
road: (S:) or the conspicuous furrowed part of<br>\
a road. (M, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The unwoven end<br>\
(هُدْب) of a piece of cloth. (Ibn-Keysán, M,<br>\
K) ―<br>\
-b4-  The woof of a piece of cloth. (T, S, A,<br>\
Mgh, K.) When cloth is woven with a double<br>\
woof, (عَلَى نِيرَيْنِ,) it is more close in texture<br>\
and more lasting. (S.) ثَوْبٌ ذُو نِيرَيْنِ signifies<br>\
A piece of cloth strongly woven, with a double<br>\
woof: (A:) or a piece of cloth woven with double<br>\
thread: (T:) and [in like manner] ↓ ثَوْبٌ مُنَيَّرٌ<br>\
a piece of cloth woven with a double woof; (Lh,<br>\
M, K;) i. e., with a double thread: (TA:) also<br>\
called دَيَابُوذ, (T, TA,) an arabicized word;<br>\
(TA;) in Persian دُوْ پُودْ, or دُوْ بُودْ, (as in<br>\
different copies of the K,) or دُوْ بَافْ. (T.) This<br>\
mode of weaving is termed مُتَآءَمَهٌ, which is the<br>\
making the woof of a double thread, and putting<br>\
two threads together upon the حَفَّة [which here<br>\
means the yarn-beam, on which the warp is<br>\
rolled]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Hence, نَاقَةٌ دَاتُ نِيرَيْنِ (tropical:)  A<br>\
she-camel having an accession of fat upon former<br>\
fat: (T:) or having, upon her, layers (صَحَائِف)<br>\
of fat; as also ذَاتُ أَنْيَارٍ: (A:) or advanced in<br>\
years, yet having some remains of strength; (M,<br>\
K;) and sometimes the epithet is applied in like<br>\
manner to a woman: (M:) and نَاقَةٌ ذَاتُ أَنْيَارٍ a<br>\
she-camel having thick flesh. (TS.) Also, رَجُلٌ<br>\
ذُو نِيرَيْنِ (tropical:)  A man whose strength is double the<br>\
strength of his companion: (S:) or strong and<br>\
firm. (A.) And رَأَىٌ ذُو نِيرَيْنِ (tropical:)  Right opinion<br>\
or counsel. (A.) And حَرْبٌ ذَاتُ نِيرَيْنِ (tropical:)  Violent<br>\
war. (T, A.)<br>\
-A2-  The canes (قَصَب) and threads<br>\
(خُيُوطَة) [in a loom], when they are put together:<br>\
(M, K:) [it is a coll. gen. n., of which the n. un.<br>\
is with ة, as appears from what here follows:]<br>\
↓ نِيرَةٌ is a subst., signifying the threads and canes,<br>\
(خُيُوطَة and قَصَبَة, [or warp and, app., cane-roll,<br>\
on which the warp is rolled when put into the<br>\
loom, and from which it is gradually unrolled as<br>\
the work proceeds,] when they are put together:<br>\
when they are separate, the threads are called<br>\
خُيُوطَةٌ; and the cane, قَصَبَةٌ, or, if a staff, عَصًا:<br>\
(AZ, Sh, T:) نِيرَةٌ is also explained as signifying<br>\
one of the implements of the weaver, with which<br>\
he weaves; namely, the transverse piece of wood<br>\
[in the loom; the same as is described above].<br>\
(T.) In the following verse of an unknown<br>\
poet,<br>\
↓ تَقْسِمُ أُسْتِيًّا لَهَا بِنَيْرِ<br>\
وَتَضْرِبُ النَّاقُوسَ وَسْطَ الدَّيْرِ<br>\
[She divides warp that she has with cane-rolls,<br>\
and beats the nákoos in the midst of the convent],<br>\
the author may mean بِنِيرٍ, and may have altered<br>\
the word by necessity; or ↓ نَيْرٌ may be a dial.<br>\
form of نِيرُ. (M.) One says of a man who<br>\
neither harms nor profits, مَا أَنْتَ بِسَتَاةٍ وَلَا لُحْمَةٍ<br>\
وَلَا نِيرَةٍ (tropical:)  [lit. Thou art not a warp nor a woof<br>\
nor a cane-roll]. (T.) [See also a similar<br>\
saying voce حَفَّةٌ.]<br>\
-A3-  [The yoke of a bull; the<br>\
piece of wood that is upon the neck of the bull,<br>\
together with its apparatus: (M, K:) or the<br>\
piece of wood that is placed transversely upon the<br>\
necks of the two bulls (T, S) yoked together for<br>\
ploughing: (T:) called نِيرُ الفَدَّانِ: (S:) pl. [of<br>\
pauc.] أَنْيَارٌ and [of mult.] نِيرَانٌ: (S, M, K:) of<br>\
the dial. of Syria. (M.)<br>\

finisher: or a person who will do harm nor one<br>\
who will profit]. (TA.)<br>\
مُنَيَّرٌ: see نِيرٌ. ―<br>\
