horse, [&amp;c.,] S, A, &amp;c.) was, or became, lean, or<br>\
light of flesh: (S:) or slender, and lean: (Msb:)<br>\
or lean, and lank in the belly: (A, K:) or lank in<br>\
the belly by reason of leanness: (Mgh:) and<br>\
↓ اضطمر signifies the same. (S, K.) [See also<br>\

feeding him with food barely sufficient to sustain<br>\
him, after he had become fat; as also ↓ اضمرهُ.<br>\
(Msb:) he fed him with food barely sufficient to<br>\
sustain him, after he had become fat; as also<br>\
↓ اضمرهُ: (K:) or he fed him with fodder so that<br>\
he became fat, and then reduced him to food<br>\
barely sufficient to sustain him; which is done<br>\
during forty days: (S:) or he saddled him, and<br>\
put on him a housing, in order that he might<br>\
sweat under it, and so lose his flabbiness, and<br>\
become firm in flesh; and then mounted upon<br>\
him a light boy or young man, to make him run,<br>\
but not to make him go so quick a pace as that<br>\
which is termed عَنَق; by the doing of which, one<br>\
becomes in no fear of his losing his breath in running, and a quick run does not cut him short:<br>\
this (says AM) is what I have seen the Arabs<br>\
practise; and they term it تَضْمِيرٌ, and also<br>\
↓ مِضْمَارٌ. (T, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also He, or it, weakened,<br>\

―<br>\
-b4-  [And hence, He suppressed it, (namely a<br>\

-b2-  Hence, in<br>\
the opinion of ISd, as he says in the M, it is<br>\
also applied to a horse as meaning دَقِيقُ<br>\
الحَجَاجَيْنِ [i. e. Thin in the bones surrounding,<br>\
or projecting over, the cavities of the eyes: in the<br>\
TA, الهجاجين, an obvious mistranscription; and<br>\

-b3-  And Narrow; (O, K;)<br>\

says, it is not of the shrub-kind, and has [what<br>\
are termed] هَدَب [q. v.] like the هَدَب of the<br>\
أَرْطَى: (TA:) AHn says, it resembles the رِمْث,<br>\
except that it is yellow (أَصْفَرُ [app. a mistranscription for أَصْغَرُ i. e. smaller]), and it has little<br>\
wood, [and] the small and dry parts of its<br>\
branches are fed upon [by the camels] (يُحْتَطَبُ):<br>\
he adds, on the authority of the ancient Arabs of<br>\
the desert, that it is [of the kind called] حَمْض,<br>\

ضَامِرَةٌ; (S;) [and to a man;] ضَامِرٌ applied to a<br>\

Arab of the desert, of El-Yemen, that the ضيمران<br>\
is exactly like the حَوْك [which is one of the names<br>\
now applied to sweet basil], of sweet odour, and<br>\
is therefore asserted by some to be the شاهسفرم,<br>\
but the ضيمران is wild; and he says that some<br>\

الْسِّبَاقُ وَالسَّابِقُ مَنْ سَبَقَ الْجَنَّةَ [To-day is a time<br>\
for training, and to-morrow is the race, and the<br>\
winner is he who wins Paradise:] i. e., to-day one<br>\

app. meaning The goal, or limit, of the horse<br>\
in racing: but in the TA, these words are made<br>\
