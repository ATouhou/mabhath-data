ضَنْءٌ and ضُنُوْءٌ; (S, M, O, K;) and accord. to the<br>\
K, ضَنِئَتْ, but MF says that this latter is unknown, i. e., it is not mentioned in the other<br>\
lexicons in the sense here assigned to it in the<br>\
K; (TA;) and ↓ اضنأت; (S, M, O, K;) She (a<br>\
woman) had many children: (S, M, O, Msb, K:)<br>\
[and so ضَنَتْ and ضَنِيَتْ, as mentioned in art.<br>\
ضنو:] and in like manner one says of cattle;<br>\
(M;) [i. e.] one says, ضَنَأَ المَالُ (S, O, K) and<br>\
ضَنِئَ, (O, K,) and صَنَأَتِ المَاشِيَةُ and ضَنِئَت,<br>\
(TA,) [and ↓ اضنأ and اضنأت as is implied in the<br>\
M,] The cattle multiplied, or became numerous or<br>\
many. (S, O, K, TA.) And ضَنَأَتْ is said to<br>\
signify She brought forth. (TA.) ―<br>\

مِنْهُ He was abashed at, or<br>\
shy of, and he shrank at, or from, him, or it.<br>\
(M, K. [See also اضطبأ.]) Et-Tirimmáh uses<br>\
اِضْطَنَا [or اِضْطَنَى in this sense,] and يَضْطَنِى:<br>\
meaning اضطنأ [and يضطنئ]: or as being derived from الضَّنَى meaning “ disease. ” (M.)<br>\
ضَنْءٌ Children, or offspring; as also ↓ ضِنْءٌ; (S,<br>\
M, O, K; [and so ضَنْوٌ and ضِنْوٌ, as mentioned in<br>\
art. ضنو;]) the former accord. to El-Umawee,<br>\
and both accord. to AA: (S, O:) the former<br>\
signifies the offspring of anything: (TA:) and<br>\
also, (K, TA, [in a copy of the M ↓ the latter,<br>\
but this is app. a mistranscription,]) multitude of<br>\
offspring: it is like نَفَرٌ (M, K) and رَهْطٌ, (M,)<br>\
having no. n. un.: the pl. is ضُنُوْءٌ. (M, K.)<br>\
ضِنْءٌ Origin, root, race, or stock; syn. أَصْلٌ:<br>\
(El-Umawee, S, M, O, K:) and the place in<br>\
which a thing originates; syn. مَعْدِنٌ. (ElUmawee, S, O, K.) One says, فُلَانٌ فِى ضِنْءِ<br>\
صِدْقٍ [Such a one is of an excellent origin or race<br>\
or stock], (S, O, L,) and فِى ضِنْءِ سَوْءٍ [of a bad<br>\
origin &amp;c.]. (L.) ―<br>\

M, O, or ضَرُورَةٌ, K; [both meaning the same;])<br>\
that befalls a man: (O:) so in the saying قَعَدَ<br>\
مَقْعَدَ ضُنْأَة (M, K) and ↓ ضُنَآءَةٍ (K) [lit. He sat<br>\
in the sitting-place of necessity, &amp;c.; meaning he<br>\
was, or became, in an abject condition]: the<br>\
phrase denotes disdain, or scorn; and is thought<br>\
by AM to be from اِضْطَنَأَ meaning “ he was<br>\
abashed, &amp;c. ” (TA.)<br>\
ضُنَآءَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
