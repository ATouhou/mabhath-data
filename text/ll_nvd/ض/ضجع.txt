ضَجَعَ, aor.<br>\
ضَجَعَ, inf. n. ضَجْعٌ and ضُجُوعٌ, [He<br>\
lay upon his side; or] he laid his side upon the<br>\
ground; [and simply he lay; and he slept;] as<br>\
also ↓ اِضْطَجَعَ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) which is also<br>\
expl. as syn. with نَامَ, [which has the second and<br>\
third of the meanings mentioned above,] and with<br>\
اِسْتَلْقَى, [which has the third of those meanings,]<br>\
(TA,) the ط being substituted for the ت of اِضْتَجَعَ,<br>\
(Lth, S, Msb,) and ↓ اِضَّجَعَ, (S, Msb, K,) and<br>\
↓ اِلْطَجَعَ, (S, L, K, in the CK [erroneously]<br>\
اطَّجَعَ,) the ض in اضطجع being changed into ل,<br>\
which is the letter nearest in sound thereto,<br>\
because the combination of two such letters as ض<br>\
and ط is disliked, (S, L,) the same change occurring in اِلْطِرَادٌ for اِضْطِرَادٌ, (Az, TA,) though this<br>\
change is anomalous; (L;) and ↓ أَضْجَعَ likewise<br>\
signifies the same as ضَجَعَ; (Msb;) [and] so does<br>\
↓ انضجع, (K, TA,) as quasi-pass. of the trans.<br>\

↓ اضجع; and so ضَجِعَ, like فَرِحَ [in measure],<br>\
on the authority of IKtt. (TA. [See also 2,<br>\
and 5, and 6.]) And ضُجِعَ فِى رَأْيِهِ [not a mistranscription for ضَجِعَ, as is shown by its part. n.,<br>\
q. v.,] (tropical:)  He was, or became, weak in his judgment,<br>\

namely, his girl, or young woman, (TA,) in, or<br>\
on, one bed, (Msb,) or in one innermost garment.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, ضاجعهُ الهَمُّ (tropical:)  Anxiety clave<br>\
to him. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَضْجَعْتُهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِضْجَاعٌ, (TA,)<br>\
I laid him upon his side; (S, * Msb;) I laid his<br>\
side upon the ground. (K.) ―<br>\
