ضَوْنَةٌ, (K,) an inf. n. of which the verb is<br>\
ضَانَ, aor. يَضُونُ, said of a man, (TK,) The<br>\
having numerous offspring; as also ↓ تَضَوُّنٌ.<br>\
(K.) [Probably from ضَيْوَنٌ.]<br>\
5<br>\
تَضَوَّنَ see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
ضَوْنٌ The إِنْفَحَة [i. e. runnet, or runnet-bag, of<br>\
a hid, or lamb]. (K.)<br>\
ضَانَةٌ A nose-ring of brass (بُرَةٌ M, K, مِنْ صُفْرٍ<br>\
M) for a camel: (K:) or a [camel&#39;s nose-ring<br>\
such as is termed] خِزَامَة; accord. to Sh: mentioned in the K in art. ضأن; but this is its<br>\
proper place, for it is without. (TA.)<br>\
ضَوْنَةٌ A young female child. (K, TA. [In<br>\
the CK, الظَّبْيَةُ is put for الصَّبِيَّةُ.])<br>\
ضَيْوَنٌ, (S, M, K,) of the measure فَيْعَلٌ, not<br>\
فَعْوَلٌ, because the former is the more common,<br>\
(IB, TA,) extr. [in respect of rule], preserving<br>\
its original form, (M,) without إِدْغَام [i. e. not<br>\
having its و incorporated into the ى so as to<br>\
become ضَيَّنٌ, as it should by rule,] because it is<br>\
a primitive noun, (S,) like حَيْوَةُ, which is a<br>\
proper name of a man, (S, M,) but more extr.<br>\
because that is allowable in a proper name which<br>\
is not allowable in another kind of word, (M,)<br>\
[A he-cat;] i. q. سِنَّوْرٌ [q. v.]; (M:) the male<br>\
سِنَّوْر: (S, K:) or a certain small beast resembling<br>\
the سِنَّوْر: (M:) pl. ضَيَاوِنُ, (S, K,) in which the<br>\
و is unaltered because it is so in the sing.: (S,<br>\
TA:) Sb says, the dim. is ↓ ضُيَيِّنٌ, like أُسَيِّدٌ<br>\
[dim. of أَسْوَدُ], but he who says أُسَيْوِدٌ may say<br>\
↓ ضُيَيْوِنٌ. (S.)<br>\
ضُيَيِّنٌ and ضُيَيْوِنٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
