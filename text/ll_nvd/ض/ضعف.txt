which is of the dial. of Temeem, is of the latter<br>\
verb, (Msb,) He, or it, was, or became, weak,<br>\
feeble, faint, frail, infirm, or unsound; ضُعْفٌ<br>\
and ضَعْفٌ being the contr. of قُوَّةٌ, (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) and of صِحَّةٌ; (Msb;) and both of them<br>\
may be used alike, in every relation; or, accord.<br>\
to the people of El-Basrah, both are so used; so<br>\
says Az; (TA;) but some say that the former is<br>\
used in relation to the body, and the latter in relation to the judgment or opinion. (O, Msb, K:<br>\
but this is omitted in my copy of the TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
ضَعُفَ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ means He lacked strength, or<br>\
power, or ability, to do or accomplish, or to bear,<br>\
the thing; [he was weak so as to be disabled, or<br>\
incapacitated, from doing, or accomplishing, or<br>\
from bearing, the thing;] syn. عَجَزَ عَنْهُ, (Msb<br>\
in art. عجز,) or عَجَزَ عَنِ احْتِمَالِهِ. (Msb in the<br>\
present art.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [See also ضَعْفٌ below.]<br>\

ضَعِيف [i. e. weak, &amp;c.]; (O, K;) and so ↓ استضعفهُ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K,) and ↓ تضعّفهُ: (O, K:) or ↓ استضعفهُ<br>\
signifies he found him to be so; (TA;) or he<br>\
asserted him to be (جَعَلَهُ) so; (Msb;) or, as also<br>\
↓ تضعّفهُ, he [esteemed him to be so, and therefore]<br>\
behaved proudly, haughtily, or insolently, towards<br>\
him, in respect of worldly things, because of [his]<br>\
poverty, and meanness of condition. (IAth, TA.)<br>\
غَلَبَنِى أَهْلُ الكُوفَةِ أَسْتَعْمِلُ عَلَيْهِمُ المُؤْمِنَ فَيُضَعَّفُ<br>\
وَأَسْتَعْمِلُ عَلَيْهِمُ القَوِىَّ فَيُفَجَّرُ, [The people of<br>\
El-Koofeh have overcome me: I employ as<br>\
governor over them the believer, and he is esteemed<br>\
weak; and I employ as governor over them the<br>\
strong, and he is charged with unrighteousness:]<br>\
is a saying mentioned in a trad. of &#39;Omar. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And He attributed, or ascribed, (O, K,) to<br>\
him, i. e. a man, (O,) or (tropical:)  to it, i. e. a tradition,<br>\

of a man, of judgment, and in the case of a tradition &amp;c., of authority]. (O, K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And<br>\
He doubled it, or made it double, covering one<br>\
part of it with another part. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
3<br>\
ضاعفهُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. مُضَاعَفَةٌ; (S, Msb;)<br>\
and ↓ ضعّفهُ, (S K,) inf. n. تَضْعِيفٌ; (S, O, Msb;)<br>\
and ↓ اضعفهُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. إِضْعَافٌ; (S, Msb;)<br>\
all signify the same; (S, K;) i. e. He doubled it,<br>\
or made it double, or two-fold; (O, K;) [and<br>\
trebled it, or made it treble, or three-fold; and<br>\
redoubled it, or made it several-fold, or manyfold; i. e. multiplied it; for] Kh says, التَّضْعِيفُ<br>\
signifies the adding to a thing so as to make it<br>\
double, or two-fold; or more [i. e. treble, or threefold; and several-fold, or many-fold]; (S, O,<br>\
Msb;) and so الإِضْعَافُ, and المُضَاعَفَةُ; (S, Msb;)<br>\
and ↓ ضَعَفَهُ, without teshdeed, signifies the same<br>\
as ضاعفهُ. (Ham p. 257.) The saying, in the<br>\
Kur [xxxiii. 30], يُضَاعَفْ لَهَا العَذَابُ ضِعْفَيْنِ,<br>\
(Mgh, O, K,) in which AA read ↓ يُضَعَّفْ, (TA,)<br>\
accord. to AO, (Mgh, O,) means, The punishment shall be made to her three punishments;<br>\
(Mgh, O, K;) for, he says, she is to be punished<br>\
once; and when the punishment is doubled twofold, [or is repeated twice,] the one becomes<br>\
three: (TA:) he adds, (O,) and the tropical<br>\
meaning of يُضَاعَفْ (مَجَازُ يُضَاعَفْ [for which<br>\
مَجازٌ يُضَاعَفُ is erroneously put in the CK]) is<br>\
two things&#39; being added to a thing so that it<br>\
becomes three: (O, K:) but Az disapproves this,<br>\
saying that it is peculiar to the tropical and the<br>\
common conventional speech, whereas the skilled<br>\
grammarians state the meaning to be, she shall be<br>\
punished with twice the like of the punishment of<br>\
another; (Mgh;) [so that it may be rendered the<br>\
punishment shall be doubled to her, made two-fold;<br>\
and in like manner] Ibn-&#39;Arafeh explains it as<br>\
meaning she shall have two shares of punishment.<br>\
(O.) فَيُضَاعِفُهُ لَهُ أَضْعَافًا كَثِيرَةً [And He will multiply it to him many-fold, or, as some read, فَيُضَاعِفَهُ<br>\
that He may multiply it,] is another phrase<br>\
occurring in the Kur [ii. 246]. (O, TA.) And<br>\
one says, الثَّوَابَ لِلْقَوْمِ ↓ أَضْعَفْتُ [I doubled, or<br>\
multiplied, the recompense to the people, or party].<br>\
(Msb.) And القَوْمُ ↓ أُضْعِفَ The people, or party,<br>\
had a doubling, or multiplying, [of their recompense, &amp;c.,] made to them; (Msb;) [and so,<br>\
app., أَضْعَفُوا; (see مُضْعِفٌ;)] i. q. ضُوعِفَ لَهُمْ.<br>\
(S, O, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اضعفهُ He, (God, Msb, or another, S,) or<br>\
it, (disease, TA,) rendered him ضَعِيف [i. e. weak,<br>\
&amp;c.]; (S, O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ ضعّفهُ. (L, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And أَضْعَفَ, said of a man, He became one<br>\
whose beast was weak. (S, O, K.)<br>\
-A3-  See also 3,<br>\
first sentence, and last two sentences.<br>\

تَضَعَّفَ see 2, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  [تضعّف app. signifies also He manifested weakness: see تضوّر.]<br>\
6<br>\
تضاعف signifies صَارَ ضِعْفَ مَا كَانَ [i. e. It<br>\
became double, or two-fold; and treble, or threefold; and several-fold, or many-fold]. (O, K.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَضْعَفَ see 2, in two places.<br>\
ضَعْفٌ an inf. n. of 1, like ↓ ضُعْفٌ, (S, *  O, *<br>\
Msb, K,) [both, when used as simple substs.,<br>\
signifying Weakness, feebleness, &amp;c.,] but some<br>\
say that the former is in the judgment or opinion,<br>\
and the latter in the body; (O, Msb, K;) and<br>\
↓ ضَعَفٌ signifies the same, (IAar, K, TA,) and is<br>\
in the body and also in the judgment or opinion<br>\
and the intellect. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ضَعْفُ التَّأْلِيفِ [Weakness of construction, in language,] is such a construction of the members of a sentence as is contrary to the [generally approved] rules of syntax;<br>\
as when a pronoun is introduced before its noun<br>\
with respect to the actual order of the words and<br>\
the order of the sense [in a case in which the<br>\
pronoun is affixed to the agent in a verbal proposition]; for instance, in the phrase, ضَرَبَ غُلَامُهُ<br>\
زَيْدًا [“ His,” i. e. Zeyd&#39;s, “young man beat<br>\
Zeyd ”]. (KT.) When the pronoun is affixed to<br>\
the objective complement, as in خَافَ رَبَّهُ عُمَرُ<br>\
[“ &#39;Omar feared his Lord ”] such introduction of<br>\
it is common: (I&#39;Ak p. 128:) and it is [universally] allowable when the pronoun is of the<br>\
kind called ضَمِيرُ الشَّأْنِ, as in إِنَّهُ زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ; or<br>\
ضَمِيرُ رُبَّ, as in رُبَّهُ رَجُلًا لَقِيتُهُ; or ضَمِيرُ نِعْمَ, as<br>\
in نِعْمَهُ رَجُلًا زَيْدٌ. (Kull p. 56.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [In the CK,<br>\
a signification belonging to ضُعْف is assigned to<br>\
ضَعْف.]<br>\
ضُعْفٌ: see ضَعْفٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  مِنْ ضُعْفٍ in the Kur<br>\
xxx. 53 means Of sperm. (O, K, TA.) AA,<br>\
reciting before the Prophet, said مِنْ ضَعْفٍ; and<br>\
was told by the latter to say من ضُعْفٍ, [i. e.]<br>\
with damm. (TA.)<br>\
ضِعْفُ الشَّىْءِ signifies The like of the thing,<br>\
(AO, Zj, S, O, Msb, K, TA,) that doubles it<br>\
(يُضْعِفُهُ); (Zj, TA;) and ضِعْفَاهُ, twice the like of<br>\
it; (AO, S, O, Msb, K;) and أَضْعَافُهُ, the likes of<br>\
it: (S, Msb:) الضِّعْفُ in the [proper] language<br>\
of the Arabs means the like: this is the original<br>\
signification: (Az, Msb:) and (K, TA, but in<br>\
CK “ or,”) then, by a later [and conventional]<br>\
usage, (Az, Msb,) the like and more, the addition<br>\
being unlimited: (Az, Msb, K:) one says, هٰذَا<br>\
ضِعْفُ هٰذَا i. e. This is the like of this: and هٰذَانِ<br>\
ضِعْفَاهُ i. e. These two are twice the like of it: and<br>\
it is allowable in the language of the Arabs to<br>\
say, هٰذَا ضِعْفُهُ meaning This is twice the like [i. e.<br>\
the double] of it, and thrice the like [i. e. the treble]<br>\
of it, [and more,] because the ضِعْف is an unlimited addition: (Az, Msb: [and the like is<br>\
said in the O, on the authority of Az:]) and one<br>\
says, لَكَ ضِعْفُهُ meaning Thou shalt have twice the<br>\
like of it, (Zj, O, K,) using the sing. form, though<br>\
the dual form is better, (Zj, O,) and meaning also<br>\
thrice the like of it, and more without limit: (K:)<br>\
and الاِثْنَانِ ضِعْفُ الوَاحِدِ [i. e. الاثنان is the double<br>\
of الواحد]: (M and K in art. ثنى:) and if one say<br>\
in his will, أَعْطُوهُ ضِعْفَ نَصِيبِ وَلَدِى, twice the<br>\
like of the share of his child is given to him; and<br>\
if he say ضِعْفَيْهِ, thrice the like thereof is given<br>\
to him; so that if the share of the son be a<br>\
hundred, he [the legatee] is given two hundred<br>\
in the former case, and three hundred in the latter<br>\
case; for the will is made to accord with the<br>\
common conventional language, not with the<br>\
niceties of the [proper] language: (Az, Msb: [and<br>\
the like is said, but less fully, in the Mgh:]) the<br>\
pl. is أَضْعَافٌ only. (TA.) إِذًا لَأَذَقْنَاكَ ضِعْفَ<br>\
الحَيَاةِ وَضِعْفَ المَمَاتِ, in the Kur [xvii. 77], means<br>\
ضِعْفَ العَذَابِ حَيًّا وَمَيِّتًا, (S,) or ضِعْفَ عَذَابِ<br>\
الحَيَاةِ وَضِعْفَ عَذَابِ المُمَاتِ, (O, Jel,) i. e. [In<br>\
that case we would assuredly have made thee to<br>\
taste] the like [or, as some explain it, the double]<br>\
of the punishment of others in the present world<br>\
and [the like or the double thereof] in the world to<br>\
come: (Jel:) [Sgh adds, app. on the authority<br>\
of Ibn-&#39;Arafeh,] the meaning is, the punishment<br>\
of others should be made two-fold, or more,<br>\
(يُضَاعَف,) to thee, because thou art a prophet.<br>\
(O.) In the saying, فَأُولَائِكَ لَهُمْ جَزَآءُ الضِّعْفِ<br>\
بِمَا عَمِلُوا, in the Kur [xxxiv. 36], by الضِّعْفِ is<br>\
meant الأضْعَافِ [i. e. For these shall be the recompense of the likes for what they have done];<br>\
and it is most properly held to denote ten of the<br>\
likes thereof, because of the saying in the Kur<br>\
[vi. 161], “Whoso doth that which is good, for<br>\
him shall be ten of the likes thereof. ” (O.) In<br>\
the saying, فَآتِهِمْ عَذَابًا ضِعْفًا, in the Kur [vii. 36],<br>\
by ضِعْفًا is meant مُضَاعَفًا [i. e. Therefore do Thou<br>\
recompense them with a doubled, or a double,<br>\
punishment]: عَذَابٌ ضِعْفٌ meaning a punishment<br>\
as though doubled, one part of it upon another.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَضْعَافُ الكِتَابِ means (tropical:)  The interspaces<br>\
of the lines, (S, O, K, TA,) or of the margin, (S,<br>\
O,) or and of the margins, (K, TA,) of the writing,<br>\
or book: (S, O, K, TA:) so in the saying, وَقَّعَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ فِى أَضْعَافِ كِتَابِهِ (tropical:)  [Such a one made an<br>\
entry of a note or postil or the like, or entries of<br>\
notes &amp;c., in the interspaces of the lines, &amp;c., of<br>\
his writing, or book]: (S, O, TA:) and ↓ تَضَاعِيفُ<br>\
الكِتَابِ signifies the same as أَضْعَافُهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And أَضْعَافُ الجَسَدِ (assumed tropical:)  The limbs, members, or<br>\
organs, (أَعْضَآء,) of the body: (O, K:) or the<br>\
bones thereof: (AA, K:) or the bones thereof<br>\
having flesh upon them: (TA:) sing. ضِعْفٌ. (K.)<br>\
Hence the saying of Ru-beh,<br>\
وَاللّٰهُ بَيْنَ القَلْبِ وَالأَضْعَافِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [And God is between the heart and the limbs,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (TA.) And it is said of Yoonus, [the<br>\
prophet Jonah,] كَانَ فِى أَضْعَافِ الحُوتِ (tropical:)  [He<br>\
was amid the members of the fish]. (TA.)<br>\

O) means [For man was created weak, or] subject<br>\
to be inclined by his desire. (O, L, K.) And<br>\
الضَّعِيفَانِ [The two weak ones] means the woman<br>\
and the slave: hence the trad., اِتَّقُوا اللّٰهَ فِى<br>\
الضَّعِيفَيْنِ [Fear ye God in respect of the woman<br>\
and the slave]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In the dial. of Himyer,<br>\
Blind: and [it is said that] thus it signifies in<br>\
the phrase لَنَرَاكَ فِينَا ضَعِيفًا [Verily we see thee to<br>\
be, among us, blind], (O, K,) in the Kur [xi. 93]:<br>\
(O:) but Esh-Shiháb rejects this, in the &#39;Inayeh.<br>\

مُضْعِفٌ A man whose beast, (S, K, and Mgh in<br>\
