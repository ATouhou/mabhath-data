he was, or became, diseased, disordered, or sick;<br>\
(S, and Ham ibid.;) because disease occasions<br>\
leanness, or emaciation: (Ham:) or he was, or<br>\
became, lean, or emaciated: (so accord. to the<br>\
explanation of the inf. n. in the Mgh:) or he was,<br>\
or became, affected with a disease, disorder, or<br>\
sickness, (M, Msb, K,) of long continuance, and<br>\
settled, (M,) or constant, so that he was at the<br>\
point of death, (Msb,) or such as infected, or pervaded, him, and so that, whenever he thought<br>\
himself to be recovering, he relapsed. (K.)<br>\

اضناهُ, said of a disease, disorder, or sickness, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) It rendered him such<br>\

him lean, or emaciated: (Mgh:) or oppressed<br>\
him; burdened him heavily; overburdened him;<br>\
or overcame him, and rendered him heavy. (S,<br>\

woman (IAar, T, S, Msb) and to two persons<br>\
(Msb) and to a pl. number, (Fr, IAar, T, S,<br>\
Msb,) because originally an inf. n., (S, Msb,) for<br>\
ذُو ضَنًى and ذَاتُ ضَنًى [&amp;c.]; (Msb;) or some<br>\
do not dualize it nor pluralize it, because it is<br>\
[originally] an inf. n., and others dualize it and<br>\
pluralize it; (M;) but ↓ ضَنٍ has a fem. (Msb)<br>\
and a dual and a pl., (S,) its fem. being ضَنِيَةٌ<br>\
(Msb, TA) [and its dual ضَنِيَانِ] and the pl. is<br>\
أَضْنَآءٌ; (TA;) [Slender, and small in body: and<br>\
