ضَهَبَهُ بِالنَّارِ, aor.<br>\
ضَهَبَ, (K,) inf. n. ضَهْبٌ, (TK,)<br>\
He altered it, (K, TA,) and changed its colour,<br>\
(TA,) by means of fire. (K, TA.) [See also 2.]<br>\
-A2-  ضَهَبَ said of a man, (O, K,) aor.<br>\
ضَهَبَ, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. ضُهُوبٌ, (O, K,) (tropical:)  He failed of fulfilling<br>\
his promise (أَخْلَفَ), and was weak, and not like<br>\
a man: (O, K, TA:) as though likened to meat<br>\
not thoroughly cooked. (TA. [See 2.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
ضَهْبُ القَوْمِ signifies اِخْتِلَاطُهُمْ [i. e. The people&#39;s<br>\
being mixed, or confused]: (JK, O:) or أَخْلَاطُهُمْ<br>\
[i. e. ↓ ضَهْبٌ is a subst., signifying a medley, or<br>\
mixed or promiscuous multitude or collection, of<br>\
people]. (So in the K. [But I think that this<br>\
explanation is a mistranscription.]) [Or it signifies The people&#39;s multiplying themselves, and hastening: for] it is said in the “ Nawádir ” that هَضَبَ<br>\
القَوْمُ and ضَهَبُوا and هُلَبُوا and أُنَبُوا and حُطَّبُوا all<br>\
denote الإِكْثَار and الإِسْرَاع: so in the T in art.<br>\
هضب. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
ضهّب, inf. n. تَضْهِيبٌ, He roasted (Lth, K,<br>\
TA) flesh-meat (Lth, TA) upon heated stones:<br>\
(Lth, K, TA:) or he roasted, (K,) or put into<br>\
the fire, (AA, TA,) but did not cook thoroughly,<br>\
(AA, K, TA,) flesh-meat. (AA, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. as above, (S, O,) He exposed a bow,<br>\
(S, O, K,) and a spear, (S, O,) to the fire, (S, O,<br>\
K,) on the occasion of straightening it, (S, O,) or<br>\
to straighten it. (K.) [See also 1.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And He<br>\
collected together the fire; (JK;) and so ↓ ضَهْضَبَ.<br>\
(JK, O, K.)<br>\
3<br>\
مُضَاهَبَةٌ signifies Mutual reviling or vilifying; (K;) the addressing each other with bad<br>\
words. (TA.)<br>\
Q. 1<br>\
ضَهْضَبَ: see 2, last sentence. [Mentioned in this art., as though Q. Q., contr. to the<br>\
rule generally observed with respect to words of<br>\
four radical letters of which the first and third are<br>\
identical but not the second and fourth.]<br>\
ضَهْبٌ: see the first paragraph.<br>\
قَوْسٌ ضَهْبَآءُ A bow upon which the fire has taken<br>\
effect [so as to alter its colour]: (O, K:) like<br>\
ضَبْحَآءُ. (TA.)<br>\
ضَيْهَبٌ i. q. صَيْهَبٌ, meaning A place where flesh-meat is roasted [on the ground heated by the sun];<br>\
(K; [in the CK, لِمَشْوِىِّ اللّحمِ is erroneously<br>\
put for لِمَشْوَى اللَّحْمِ;]) accord. to Lth, any [high<br>\
ground such as is called] قُفّ, or rugged ground,<br>\
or place on a mountain, upon which the sun shines<br>\
with such heat that flesh-meat will roast upon it:<br>\
but Az says that what Lth means is صَيْهَبٌ only,<br>\
with the unpointed ص; (O, * TA;) and if so, the<br>\
meaning assigned here in the K is not correct.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُضَهَّبٌ Flesh-meat roasted, but not thoroughly<br>\
cooked: (S, A, O:) accord. to El-Mufaddal, flesh-meat cut in pieces; (O;) and thus in the K;<br>\
(TA;) but IF says that this is nought, unless it<br>\
be cut in pieces roasted: (O:) it is at variance<br>\
with what is said by the leading authorities, for<br>\
they say that it means flesh-meat roasted upon<br>\
heated stones: or roasted upon the fire, but not<br>\
thoroughly cooked: (TA:) or cooked in a fryingpan. (TA in art. عرص.) Imra-el-Keys says,<br>\
نَمُشُّ بِأَعْرَافِ الجِيَادِ أَكُفَّنَا<br>\
إِذَا نَحْنُ قُمْنَا عَنْ شِوَآءٍ مُضَهَّبِ<br>\
[We wipe our hands with the manes of the swift<br>\
horses when we rise from eating roast meat not<br>\
thoroughly cooked]. (S, O.)<br>\
