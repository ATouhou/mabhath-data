ضَرَبَهُ, aor.<br>\
ضَرِبَ, (S, O, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. ضَرْبٌ,<br>\
(S, O, &amp;c.,) [He beat, struck, smote, or hit, him,<br>\
or it;] and ↓ ضرّبهُ [signifies the same in an intensive sense, i. e. he beat, &amp;c., him, or it, much,<br>\
or violently; or in a frequentative sense, i. e.<br>\
several, or many, times: or rather ضرّب is used<br>\
in relation to several, or many, objects, as will<br>\
be shown in what follows]: (K:) accord. to<br>\
Er-Rághib, الضَّرْبُ signifies the making a thing<br>\
to fall upon another thing; and, as some say,<br>\
the making it to fall with violence, or vehemence.<br>\
(TA.) You say, ضَرَبَهُ بِهِ [He struck him, or it,<br>\
with it], i. e. with a sword, (A, Mgh, Msb), &amp;c.<br>\
(A, Msb.) And تَضْرِبُ فِى حَدِيدٍ بَارِدٍ [Thou<br>\
beatest upon cold iron]: a prov. [expl. in art.<br>\
حد]. (Har p. 633.) And ضَرَبْتُ زَيْدًا سَوْطًا,<br>\
meaning بِسَوْطٍ [i. e. I struck Zeyd with a whip],<br>\
or ضَرْبَةَ سَوْطٍ [a stroke of a whip]: (M in art.<br>\
سوط, q. v.:) and ضَرَبَهُ مِائَةَ سَوْطٍ [He struck him<br>\
a hundred strokes of the whip]. (S and K in art.<br>\
سحل, &amp;c.) And ضَرَبْتُ عُنُقَهُ [I smote his neck,<br>\
meaning I beheaded him]; and الأَعْنَاقَ ↓ ضَرَّبْتُ<br>\
[I smote the necks, meaning I struck off the<br>\
heads]; the teshdeed denoting muchness [of the<br>\
action] or multiplicity [of the objects]: AZ says<br>\
that, when the object is one, the Arabs use only<br>\
the former verb, without teshdeed; but when<br>\
there is a plurality of objects, either of the verbs;<br>\
(Msb;) [so that] one says, ضَرَبُوا أَعْنَاقَهُمْ [They<br>\
smote their necks, or beheaded them], and أَمَرَ<br>\
الرِّقَابِ ↓ بِتَضْرِيبِ [He gave the order to smite<br>\
the necks, or to strike off the heads]: (A:) فَضَرْبَ<br>\
الرِّقَابِ in the Kur xlvii. 4 is originally فَاضْرِبُوا<br>\
الرِّقَابَ ضَرْبًا [meaning Then do ye smite the necks,<br>\
i. e. strike off the heads]; (Bd;) the inf. n. being<br>\
here put for its verb. (Jel.) [Respecting the<br>\
phrase هُوَ الْيَضْرِبُكَ, see 1 in art. جدع.] ―<br>\

a variety of meanings and phrases here following.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  ضَرَبَ كَلْبَهُ عَلَى الصَّيْدِ (assumed tropical:)  [He beat, or disciplined, or trained, his dog for the purpose of the<br>\
chase]: whence the phrases ضَرَبَ عَلَيْهِ جِرْوَتَهُ and<br>\

جِرْوَةٌ]. (Z, and TA in art. جرو.) ―<br>\

cast, threw, or flung, him, or it, upon the ground.<br>\
And ضَرَبَ بِسَلْحِهِ الأَرْضَ (assumed tropical:)  He cast forth his<br>\

[hence] ضَرَبَ الأَرْضَ and الغَائِطَ (tropical:)  He voided<br>\
excrement, or ordure; (A, TA;) and so الخَلَآءَ.<br>\
(TA.) [ضَرَبَ بِنَفْسِهِ الأَرْضَ see expl. in the latter<br>\
half of this paragraph.] ―<br>\
-b6-  ضَرَبْتُ القَوْسَ بِالمِضْرَبِ<br>\
I struck the string of the bow with the wooden implement [or mallet] used in separating cotton.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b7-  ضَرَبَ العُودَ [He struck the chords of<br>\
the lute; meaning he played upon the lute; and<br>\
so ضَرَبَ بِالعُودِ]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b8-  ضَرَبَ الوَتِدَ, aor. and inf. n.<br>\
as above, He beat [or knocked or struck] the<br>\

ground. (Lh, TA.) And [hence] ضَرَبَ الخَيْمَةَ<br>\
(tropical:)  He pitched the tent, by knocking in its pegs with<br>\
a mallet: (Kull p. 231:) or he set up the tent.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\

الجِدَارِ (assumed tropical:)  [He stuck, or applied, the mud upon the<br>\
wall, as a plaster]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-  Hence, accord. to<br>\
some, the phrase ضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الذِّلَّةُ, in the Kur<br>\
ii. 58, considered as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Vileness was made<br>\
to cleave to them: or the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  encompassed them, like as the tent encompasses him<br>\
over whom it is pitched. (Ksh, Bd.) And [in<br>\
like manner] one says, ضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ ضَرِيبَةٌ (tropical:)  An<br>\
impost, of the tax called جِزْيَة, &amp;c., was imposed<br>\
upon them. (A, * Mgh, Msb. *) And ضَرَبَ عَلَى<br>\

meaning the night came. (TA.) [And (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
night became dark, or was dark; as appears from<br>\

سَرَى مِثْلَ نَبْضِ العِرْقِ وَاللَّيْلُ ضَارِبٌ<br>\
بِأرْوَاقِهِ وَالصُّبْحُ قَدْ كَادَ يَسْطَعُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [He went on in his night-journey, like the pulsing<br>\
of the vein, while the night was casting its folds<br>\

say also, ضَرَبَ عَلَيْهِ حِجَابًا (assumed tropical:)  [He put, or let down,<br>\
a veil, or curtain, or covering, over him, or it].<br>\
(TA.) And ضُرِبَ بَيْنَهُمَا سَدٌّ (assumed tropical:)  [A barrier was set<br>\
between them two]. (A in art. سد.) ضَرَبْنَا عَلَى<br>\
آذَانِهِمْ [in the Kur xviii. 10] means (tropical:)  We prevented<br>\
their sleeping; (K, TA;) as though by putting<br>\
a covering over their ears; a metonymical [and<br>\
elliptical] mode of saying we made them to sleep<br>\
by preventing any sound from penetrating into<br>\
their ears, in consequence of which they would<br>\
have awoke: (Zj, L, TA:) or ضَرَبَ عَلَى آذَانِهِمْ<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  he poured upon them sleep so that they<br>\
slept and did not awake: and one says also,<br>\
ضَرَبْتُ النَّوْمَ عَلَى أُذُنِهِ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  I poured sleep<br>\
upon him by closing his ear]. (Msb.) ―<br>\

ضَرِبَ, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\

stallion leaped the she-camel; (Msb, TA;) i. e.<br>\

also ↓ ضرّبهُ, (K,) inf. n. تَضْرِيبٌ: (TA:) accord.<br>\
to some, said peculiarly in relation to milk;<br>\
(MF, TA;) but [SM says,] this I have not found<br>\
in any lexicon. (TA.) ضَرَبَ اللَّبَنَ فِى السِّقَآءِ<br>\
means (tropical:)  حَقَنَهُ [i. e. He collected the milk in the<br>\
skin, and poured fresh milk upon that which was<br>\
curdled, or thick, or upon that which was churned;<br>\

In the L and other lexicons it is said that<br>\
ضَرَبْتُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِى الشَّرِّ means I caused them to<br>\
become confused [or I involved them] in evil or<br>\

means The sheep, or goat, was intermixed with<br>\

the saying,] ضَرَبَتْ فِيهِ فُلَانَةُ بِعِرْقٍ ذِى أَشَبٍ i. e.<br>\
اِلْتِبَاس; (S and TA in the present art., and in like<br>\
manner, in both, in art. اشب, with the addition<br>\

woman implanted, or engendered, in him a strain,<br>\
i. e. a radical, or hereditary, quality, of a dubious<br>\
kind: or the pronoun in فيه relates to a family,<br>\

such a woman corrupted their race by her bringing forth among them: or, as some say, عرقت<br>\
فِيهِمْ عِرْقَ سَوْءٍ [i. e. عَرَّقَتْ, or, accord. to more<br>\
common usage, أَعْرَقَتْ, i. e., implanted, or engendered, among them, or in them, an evil strain, or<br>\

saying is also mentioned in the A, as tropical,<br>\

حُرْضَةٌ.]) [And (assumed tropical:)  He played with the gamingarrows; practised sortilege with arrows, or with<br>\
the arrows.] You say, ضَرَبْتُ مَعَ القَوْمِ بِسَهْمٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I practised sortilege with the people, or party,<br>\
with an arrow; syn. سَاهَمْتُهُمْ. (Msb.) And<br>\
ضَرَبَ بِالقِدْحَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  He practised sortilege with the<br>\
two arrows; one of which was inscribed with the<br>\
sentence “ My Lord hath commanded me,” and<br>\
the other with “ My Lord hath forbidden me: ”<br>\
a person between hope and despair is likened to<br>\
one practising this mode of sortilege, which was<br>\
used by the people of the Time of Ignorance<br>\
when they doubted whether they should undertake an affair or abstain from it. (Har pp. 465<br>\
and 553.) One says also, ضَرَبَ فِى الجَزُورِبِسَهْمٍ<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He obtained a share, or portion, of the<br>\
slaughtered camel. (Mgh.) And hence the saying<br>\
of El-Hareeree, وَضَرَبْتُ فِى مَرْعَاهَا بِنَصِيبٍ (assumed tropical:)  [And<br>\

him, of the third part. (Mgh.) They say also,<br>\
ضَرَبَ فِى مَالِهِ سَهْمًا i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He assigned [a share,<br>\

busied his hands with the property, in the giving,<br>\
or dispensing of it.] ―<br>\
-b25-  ضَرَبَ عَلَى يَدِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He<br>\
struck his (i. e. another man&#39;s) hand; meaning]<br>\
he struck, or made, the bargain with him; or<br>\
ratified the sale with him: for it is a custom,<br>\
when two persons are bargaining together, for<br>\
one of them to put his hand upon the other&#39;s<br>\
in ratifying the bargain. (TA, from a trad.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b26-  And (tropical:)  He prohibited, or prevented, or hindered,<br>\

-b27-  Also (tropical:)  He corrupted, vitiated,<br>\

(A, Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b28-  ضَرَبَ عَنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  He turned away<br>\
a person or thing from him [or it]; as also<br>\
↓ اضرب: (TA:) [or] عنه ↓ اضرب signifies, (S,<br>\
Msb,) or signifies also, (TA,) and (Msb, TA)<br>\
so does ضَرَبَ عنه, (Msb, K, TA,) [the latter<br>\
app. for ضَرَبَ نَفْسَهُ عَنْهُ,] (assumed tropical:)  He turned away from,<br>\
avoided, shunned, or left, him, or it; (S *  Msb,<br>\

(Msb.) أَفَنَضْرِبُ عَنْكُمُ الذِّكْرَ صَفْحًا, in the Kur<br>\
[xliii. 4], is said to mean (assumed tropical:)  Shall we then neglect<br>\
you, and not teach you what is incumbent on you?<br>\

propounded, or declared, a parable, a similitude,<br>\
an example, or a proverb; said of God [and of a<br>\
man]: (S, * O, * Msb, TA:) or he mentioned, or<br>\
set forth, a parable, &amp;c.: or he framed a parable:<br>\
thus expl., the verb has but one objective complement: or the phrase signifies he made [such a<br>\
thing] an example, or the subject of a parable or<br>\
similitude &amp;c.; and so has two objective complements: in the saying in the Kur [xxxvi. 12]<br>\
وَاضْرِبْ لَهُمْ مَثَلًا أَصْحَابَ الْقَرْيَةِ (assumed tropical:)  [And propound<br>\
thou to them a parable, the people of the town]<br>\
i. e., the story of the people of the town, [or make<br>\
thou to them a parable, or similitude, or an<br>\
example, the people of the town;] مثلا may be in<br>\
the accus. case as an objective complement,<br>\
اضحاب القرية being a substitute for مثلا; or<br>\
اصحاب القرية may be regarded as a second<br>\
objective complement [i. e. second in the order of<br>\
the words, but first in the order of the sense]:<br>\
the phrase is differently expl. on account of the<br>\
different meanings of the verb ضَرَبَ; which signifies he described, or rehearsed; and he declared,<br>\
propounded, or explained; and he made, caused<br>\
to be, or constituted; &amp;c.; accord. to some, it is<br>\
taken from the phrase ضَرَبَ الدِرْهَمَ [q. v.];<br>\
because of the impression which a parable or the<br>\
like makes upon the mind: accord. to some, from<br>\
ضَرِيبٌ signifying “ a like; ” because the first<br>\
thing is made like the second: accord. to some,<br>\
from ضَرَبَ الطِّينَ عَلَى الجِدَارِ [q. v.; because the<br>\
mud, applied as a plaster, conforms to the shape<br>\
of the wall]: and accord. to some, from ضَرَبَ<br>\
الخَاتَمَ [q. v.]; because of the correspondence<br>\
between a parable or the like and the object to<br>\
which it is applied, and the correspondence between the signet and its impression. (TA, from<br>\
the M and L &amp;c.) يَضْرِبُ اللّٰهُ الْحَقَّ وَالْباطِلَ, in<br>\
the Kur [xiii. 18], means (assumed tropical:)  God likeneth, or compareth, truth and falsity. (TA.) One says also,<br>\

he propounded, or framed, a parable, &amp;c., respecting him, or it]. (TA.) And يُضْرَبُ المَثَلُ لِكَذَا<br>\

made for them, a way; syn. جَعَلَ. (MA. [App.<br>\

الضَّرْبُ as a conventional term of the accountants,<br>\
or arithmeticians, means The multiplying a<br>\
number by another number; (Mgh, Msb;) as<br>\
when you say, [ضَرَبَ خَمْسةً فِى سِتَّةٍ He multiplied five by six; and] خَمْسَةٌ فِى سِتَّةٍ بِثَلَاثِينَ<br>\
[Five multiplied by six is thirty]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b39-<br>\
ضَرَبَ [is often intrans., and thus] signifies also<br>\
تَحَرَّكَ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  It was, or became, in a state of<br>\
commotion, &amp;c.]: (K:) [see also 8, which is more<br>\
commonly used in this sense:] or, so with strength,<br>\

―<br>\
-b43-  جَآءَ يَضْرِبُ بِشَرٍّ (tropical:)  He came hastening [with<br>\

accord. to AM, (assumed tropical:)  The leader of the religion shall<br>\

وَمَضْرُوبَةٍ فِى غَيْرِ ذَنْبٍ بَرِيئَةِ<br>\

the condition of their sharing the gain together:<br>\

him with his (the former&#39;s) property, on that condition: thus expl. by En-Nadr; and Az also<br>\
allows the use of the word in these two senses.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُضْطَرَبٌ may mean اِضْطَرَابٌ [i. e. it may be<br>\

place in which one seeks gain: see اِضْطَرَبَ فِى<br>\
أُمُورِهِ: and see also the syns. مُرَاغَمٌ (in two places)<br>\
and مُنْتَفَدٌ.] ―<br>\

hence the phrase مُضْطَرَبَاتٌ لِلْمَعَاشِ, meaning The<br>\
things that are desired to be gained for subsistence, or sustenance: see مَرَاغِبُ.]<br>\
مُضْطَرِبٌ [A thing having its several parts in a<br>\
