below,] said of the سَرَاب [or mirage], It was, or<br>\
became, in a state of commotion; or moved to and<br>\
fro; as also ↓ تَضَحْضَحَ. (S, K.) ―<br>\

R. Q. 2<br>\
see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
ضِحٌّ The sun: (S, O, K:) and (K) the light<br>\
of the sun, (Lth, A, O, K,) when it has possession<br>\
of the ground: (Lth, O, TA:) or the light of the<br>\
sun upon the surface of the ground; sunshine;<br>\
contr. of ظِلٌّ: (AHeyth, T, O, TA:) accord. to<br>\
AHeyth, originally وِضْحٌ, the و being rejected<br>\
and a ح added to the radical ح; but correctly, it is<br>\
originally ضِحْىٌ, from ضحيت الشمس [app. a<br>\
mistranscription for ضَحِيتُ لِلشَّمْسِ]: (TA; as<br>\
from the T:) also land, or ground, that lies open<br>\
and exposed (K, TA) to the sun: (TA:) and<br>\
what is shone upon, or smitten, by the sun: (K,<br>\
TA:) it has no pl. in any of these senses. (ElFihree, TA.) It is said in a trad., لَا يَقْعُدَنَّ<br>\
أَحَدُكُمْ بَيْنَ الضِّحِّ وَالظِّلِّ فَإِنَّهُ مَقْعَدُ الشَّيْطَانِ<br>\
(S, A) (tropical:)  [None of you shall sit between the sunshine and the shade, for it is the sitting-place of the<br>\
devil]; meaning half of him in the sun and half<br>\
of him in the shade. (TA.) And one says, جَآءَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ بِالضِّحِّ وَالرِّيحِ (tropical:)  Such a one came with, or<br>\
brought, that upon which the sun had risen, and<br>\
that upon which the wind had blown; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
meaning, abundance, or much; (S, A;) or much<br>\
property, or many cattle: (TA:) [F asserts that]<br>\
one should not say بالضِّيحِ, (K,) i. e. بِالضِّيحِ<br>\
وَالرِّيحِ: (TA:) this the vulgar say, but [J<br>\
affirms that] it is nought: (S:) several, however, assert that الضِّيح is correct: (MF:) [and<br>\
the author of the K, who disallows it in this art.,<br>\
authorizes it in art. ضيح, q. v.:] Kr, also, is<br>\
related to have said that الضِيحُ signifies “ the<br>\
sun ” and “ its light; ” and is said to signify<br>\
“ what is exposed to the sun: ” and a poet says,<br>\
وَالشَّمْسُ فِى اللُّجَّةِ ذَاتِ الضِّيحِ<br>\
[And the sun in the abyss of sunlight]: Aboo-Mis-hal, moreover, mentions, in his “ Nawádir,”<br>\
the saying, اُسْتُعْمِلَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى الضِّيحِ وَالرِّيحِ<br>\
[meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one was employed as manager<br>\
of much property]. (TA.) مَاتَ عَنِ الضِّحِّ وَالرِّيحِ,<br>\
occurring in a trad., is rendered agreeably with<br>\
the explanation of the saying in a trad. mentioned<br>\
above, and means (tropical:)  He died leaving much property. (TA.) And it is said of the Prophet, in a<br>\
trad., يَكُونُ فِى الضِّحِّ وَالرِّيحِ He will be exposed<br>\
to the heat of the sun and the blowing of the winds;<br>\
meaning, accord. to Hr, (assumed tropical:)  he will be attended by,<br>\
or in the midst of, numerous horsemen and military<br>\
forces. (TA.)<br>\

ضُحْضُحٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
ضَحْضَحَةٌ and ↓ ضَحْضَحٌ and ↓ ضُحْضُحٌ The<br>\
running of the سَرَاب [or mirage, along the surface<br>\
of the ground, like water: see R. Q. 1]. (K.)<br>\
ضَحْضَاحٌ Shallow water; (S, A, TA;) and<br>\
hence metaphorically applied in a trad. to (tropical:)  a<br>\
shallow part of hell-fire: (TA:) or water little in<br>\
quantity; as also ↓ ضَحْضَحٌ: or water reaching<br>\
to the ankles: or reaching to the middle of the<br>\
skin: or in which there is no being drowned: (K:)<br>\
or water little in quantity, in a pool left by a<br>\
torrent, &amp;c. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Many, or much;<br>\
in the dial. of Hudheyl; (AA, O, K;) not known<br>\
to others: (TA: [see also ضَحْلٌ:]) accord. to<br>\
As, it is applied to sheep or goats, and to camels,<br>\
as meaning many, or numerous: and also as<br>\
meaning scattered, or dispersed, over the surface<br>\
of the land, but, notwithstanding, few. (TA.)<br>\
