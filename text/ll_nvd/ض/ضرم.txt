cattle are slaughtered and where their flesh is sold,<br>\

flesh-meat hardly, or in nowise, withholds himself<br>\
from it, and becomes extravagant in his expenditure. (TA. [See also مَجْزَرٌ.]) And one says<br>\
of a dog, ضَرِىَ بِالصَّيْدِ, (S, M, Mgh, K,) [in Har<br>\

ضِرْوٌ A dog, (M,) or young dog, (S, Kudot;,) such as<br>\
is termed ضَارٍ [i. e. habituated, or accustomed, to<br>\
the chase]; (S, M, K;) as also ↓ ضَرِىٌّ: (K,<br>\
TA: [in the CK, كالضَّرَى is erroneously put<br>\
for كَالضَّرِىِّ:]) the latter word is like غَنِىٌّ:<br>\
(TA:) the fem. of the former is with ة: and the<br>\
pl. [of pauc.] أَضْرٍ [originally أَضْرُوٌ] and [of<br>\
mult.] ضِرَآءٌ. (S, M.)<br>\
-A2-  And A taint of جُذَام<br>\
[or elephantiasis]: (M, K:) occurring in a trad.<br>\
in which it is said of Aboo-Bekr, أَكَلَ مَعَ رَجُلٍ<br>\
بِهِ ضِرْوٌ مِنْ جُذَامٍ [He ate with a man in whom<br>\
was a taint of elephantiasis]: it is from [the inf. n.]<br>\
الضَّرَاوَةُ; as though the disease became attached,<br>\
or habituated, to the person: (M, TA:) mentioned by Hr in the “ Ghareebeyn: ” (M:) or,<br>\
as some relate it, the word is with the fet-h, [i. e.<br>\
↓ ضَرْوٌ,] and is from ضَرَا said of a wound, the<br>\
meaning being in whom was a wound having an<br>\
incessant flowing. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, and ↓ ضَرْوٌ, A<br>\
species of tree, of sweet odour, with [the wood of]<br>\
which the teeth are rubbed and cleansed, and the<br>\
leaves of which are put into perfume; (M, TA;)<br>\
i. q. مَحْلَبٌ [q. v.]; so says Lth: (TA:) AHn<br>\
says, the places of its growth are mostly in ElYemen; (M, TA;) and some say that the ضِرْو<br>\
is the بُطْم [or terebinth-tree, or the fruit thereof]:<br>\
(M:) AHn says also, it is of the trees of the<br>\
mountains, and is like the great oak, (M, TA, *)<br>\
having clusters [of berries] like those of the oak,<br>\
but its berries are larger; its leaves are cooked,<br>\
and, when thoroughly cooked, are cleared away,<br>\
and the water thereof is returned to the fire, and<br>\
coagulates, (M, TA,) becoming like قُبَيْطَآء [q. v.],<br>\
(M,) and is used medicinally as a remedy for<br>\
roughness of the chest and for pain of the fauces:<br>\
(M, TA:) or the gum of a certain tree called the<br>\
كَمْكَام [i. e. the cancamum-tree], brought from<br>\
El-Yemen: (S:) or this is a mistake, for it is<br>\
the tree so called, not its gum: (K:) [but] it is<br>\
said in the T, on the authority of AHn, that<br>\
كَمْكَام signifies the bark (قِرْف) of the tree called<br>\
ضِرْو: and some say that it is the resin (عِلْك) of<br>\
the ضِرْو: and in the Moheet of Ibn-&#39;Abbád it is<br>\
said that كَمْكَام signifies the bark (قِرْف, or, as<br>\
some say, لِحَآء,) of the tree called ضِرْو, and is an<br>\
aromatic perfume: (TA:) and (K, TA) IAar<br>\
says, (TA,) the ضِرْو is the حَبَّة خَضْرَآء [or fruit of<br>\
the terebinth-tree], (K, TA,) which is also sometimes used for rubbing and cleansing the teeth:<br>\
when a girl rubs and cleanses her teeth with a stick<br>\
of the tree called ضِرْو the saliva with which the<br>\
stick is moistened from her mouth is like honey:<br>\
(TA:) and the word is also pronounced ↓ ضَرْوٌ.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
ضَرَآءٌ A level tract of land in which are beasts of<br>\
prey and a few trees: (M, K:) or a piece of land,<br>\
or ground, that conceals one: (AA, TA:) and<br>\
trees, &amp;c., that conceal one: (M:) or a thicket;<br>\
or tangled, or luxuriant, or abundant and dense,<br>\
trees; in a valley. (S, K.) One says, تَوَارَى<br>\
الصَّيْدُ مِنِّى فِى ضَرَآءِ الوَادِى [The game hid itself<br>\

creeps to him in the thicket, and walks, or goes<br>\
along, to him in the covert of trees]: said of a<br>\
man when he deludes, or circumvents, his companion: (S:) but accord. to IAar, ضرآء here<br>\
means a low, or depressed, place. (Meyd.) And<br>\
فُلَانٌ لَا يُدَبُّ لَهُ الضَّرَآءُ [app. meaning The thicket<br>\
will not be crept through to such a one: but mentioned after the last of the explanations here following]. (M.) [See also ضَرَّآءُ, in art. ضر.] ―<br>\

[It is said that] it signifies also The hiding or<br>\
concealing, oneself: (AA, K, TA:) [or] the walking, or going along, in that which conceals one<br>\
from him whom one beguiles, or circumvents. (M.)<br>\
ضِرَآءٌ, a pl. epithet, [of which the sing. is probably ↓ ضُرِىٌّ,] Courageous: hence, in a trad.,<br>\
إِنَّ فِينَا ضِرَآءُ اللّٰهِ [Verily among us are the champions of God]. (TA.)<br>\
ضَرِىٌّ: see ضِرْوٌ, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to a<br>\
vein, (S, M, K, TA,) (tropical:)  Flowing; as also ↓ ضَارٍ:<br>\
(M:) or flowing much; (TA;) of which the<br>\

to do it or undertake it or the like: and keeping,<br>\
or cleaving, thereto; being attached, addicted, or<br>\
devoted, to it; like the animal of prey to the<br>\
chase. (Msb.) [Hence,] كَلْبٌ ضَارٍ, (S, Mgh,)<br>\
or كَلْبٌ ضَارٍ بِالصَّيْدِ, (M, K,) A dog habituated,<br>\
or accustomed, to the chase: (S, Mgh, TA:) and<br>\
كَلْبَةٌ ضَارِيَةٌ. (S. [See also ضِرْوٌ, first sentence.])<br>\

words إِذَا تَطَعَّمَ بِلَحْمِهِ, app. meaning A dog<br>\
having his appetite excited by tasting the flesh of<br>\
the game.] ضَوَارٍ [is pl. of ضَارٍ applied to an<br>\

good. (M, TA.) And جَرَّةٌ ضَارِيَةٌ بِالخَلِّ and<br>\
بِالنَّبِيذِ [A jar become seasoned with vinegar and<br>\
with must or the like]. (M, TA.) الإِنَآءُ الضَّارِى,<br>\
occurring in a trad. of &#39;Alee, is said to mean The<br>\
jar that runs [or leaks]; and the drinking from<br>\
it is forbidden because it renders the drinking<br>\
troublesome: thus expl. by IAar: but it is also<br>\
expl. as meaning the wine-jar that has become<br>\

نَبِيذ is put into it, it becomes intoxicating. (TA.)<br>\
