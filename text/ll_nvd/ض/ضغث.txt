ضَغَثَ الشَّىْءَ, aor<br>\
ضَغَثَ, inf. n. ضَغْثٌ, He collected together the thing: whence ضِغْثٌ signifying<br>\
“ a handful of herbs &amp;c. ” (Msb.) See also 2.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,] ضَغَثَ الحَدِيثَ, (A, K,) aor. as<br>\
above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (S,) (tropical:)  He confused,<br>\
or confounded, [or related in a confused manner,]<br>\
the tradition, or story, or the like. (S, A, K) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And ضَغَثَ الثَّوْبَ (tropical:)  He washed the garment, or<br>\
piece of cloth, without cleansing it, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
so that it remained in a dubious state. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
ضَغَثَ السَّنَامَ, aor. as above, (K,) and so the inf. n.,<br>\
(S,) He felt the camel&#39;s hump in order to know<br>\
whether it were fat or not: (S, K:) and ضَغَثَهَا he<br>\
felt her [i. e. a she-camel] for that purpose. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  ضَغَثَ, accord. to the K, [and the O, as on the<br>\
authority of Fr,] is also said of a وَرَل, meaning<br>\
It uttered a cry: but this is correctly with ب<br>\
[i. e. ضَغَبَ]. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
ضغّث النَّبَاتَ He made the plants, or herbage,<br>\
what are termed أَضْعَاث [pl. of ضِعْثٌ]. (A, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ضغّث رَأْسَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He poured water upon<br>\
his head, and then divided the hair with his fingers<br>\
into separate handfuls, in order that the water<br>\
might reach to the skin. (L, TA.) [But see what<br>\
follows.] It is said in a trad. of &#39;Áïsheh, كَانَتْ<br>\
تُضَغِّثُ رَأْسَهَا, (TA,) or رأسها ↓ تَضْغَثُ, (so in the<br>\
JM,) meaning She used to rub about the hair of<br>\
her head with her hand, in washing, as though<br>\
mixing it together, in order that the water with<br>\
which she washed might enter into it. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اضغث الرُّؤْيَا, said of a dreamer, (tropical:)  He related<br>\
the dream confusedly. (A, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اضطغث ضِغْثًا He collected a handful of<br>\
herbage, fresh and dry mixed together. (K.)<br>\
ضَغْثٌ The state of a thing&#39;s being confused, one<br>\
part with another. (TA.)<br>\
ضِغْثٌ A handful of herbs, (AHn, S, A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) mixed together, (S, A, Msb, K,) fresh<br>\
and dry: (S, Msb, K:) or a handful of twigs of<br>\
trees or shrubs; (Mgh, * Msb;) or of fruit-stalks<br>\
of the raceme of a palm-tree: (Mgh, Msb:)<br>\
originally, a number of twigs all having one root<br>\
or stem: and afterwards applied to what is<br>\
collected together: (Msb:) or a thing that one<br>\
collects together, such as a bundle of [the species of<br>\
trefoil called] رَطْبَة; and of what has a stem, and<br>\
grows tall: (Fr, TA:) or whatever is collected<br>\
together, and grasped with the hand: (AHeyth,<br>\
TA:) or a bundle of herbs mixed together; or of<br>\
firewood: pl. أَضْغَاثٌ. (TA.) In the Kur<br>\
xxxviii. 43, it is said to mean A bundle of rushes<br>\
(أَسَل, so in the Mgh and the O, in my copy of<br>\
the Msb اثل [which I think a mistranscription,<br>\
on account of what follows]), a hundred in number, (O, Msb,) consisting of slender stalks without<br>\
leaves, (Mgh, Msb,) whereof mats are made.<br>\
(Msb.) See also a prov. cited and expl. voce<br>\
إِلَالَةٌ. Hence, in a trad., ضِغْثَانِ مِنْ نَارٍ, meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  Two bundles of lighted firewood. (TA.) And,<br>\
in another trad., مِنْهُمُ الآخِذُ الضِّغْثَ, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Among them is he who obtains somewhat of<br>\
worldly goods. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  What is confused,<br>\
and without truth, or reality, [of dreams, and] of<br>\
news, or tidings, and of an affair. (Sh, TA.)<br>\
أَضْغَاثُ أَحْلَامٍ, [occurring in the Kur xii. 44 and<br>\
xxi. 5,] of which the sing. is ضِغْثُ حُلْمٍ, (Msb,)<br>\
means (tropical:)  Complications of dreams; (A;) or medleys of dreams, falsely resembling true dreams:<br>\
(O, Msb:) or a dream of which the interpretation<br>\
will not prove true, because of its confusedness:<br>\
(ISh, S, K:) or a false dream; the pl. form<br>\
being used to give emphasis to the meaning of<br>\
unreality, or because the phrase comprehends<br>\
various things: (Bd in xii. 44:) or أَضْغَاثُ الرُّؤْيَا<br>\
means the terrors, or frightful things, of the dream.<br>\
(Mujáhid, O, TA.) One says also, أَتَانَا بِأَضْغَاثٍ<br>\
مِنَ الأَخْبَارِ, meaning (tropical:)  He brought us [various]<br>\
sorts of news, or tidings. (TA.) ضِغْثٌ means<br>\
also (assumed tropical:)  A deed that is of a mixed kind, not pure,<br>\
or not sincere. (IAth and O, from a trad.) And<br>\
كَلَامٌ ضِغْثٌ (assumed tropical:)  Speech in which is no good: pl.<br>\
أَضْغَاثٌ. (TA.)<br>\
ضَغُوثٌ, applied to a she-camel, i. q. ضَبُوثٌ; (S,<br>\
K;) i. e. Of which one doubts whether she be fat,<br>\
and which one therefore feels with his hand; (S;)<br>\
or of which one feels the hump, in order to know<br>\
whether she be fat or not: pl. ضُغْثٌ. (TA.) And<br>\
A camel&#39;s hump of which one doubts whether it be<br>\
fat or not. (Kr, TA.)<br>\
ضَغِيثَةٌ A confused company of men. (O.)<br>\
ضَاغِثٌ One who hides himself in a thicket or<br>\
the like, and frightens boys by a sound reiterated<br>\
in his fauces: (S:) the author of the K, following<br>\
Sgh in the TS and O, and Az in the T, says that<br>\
this is a mistake, and that the word is correctly<br>\
written with ب [i. e. ضَاغِبٌ]; but IF and IM<br>\
and others write it as in the S. (TA.)<br>\
تَضْغِيثٌ Rain that moistens the earth and the<br>\
herbage. (K.)<br>\
