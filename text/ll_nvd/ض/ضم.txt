And ضَمَمْتُهُ إِلَى صَدْرِى [I drew him, or pressed<br>\
him, to my bosom;] I embraced him. (TA.)<br>\
And أَنْفُسَهُمْ] ضَمَّ القَوْمُ,  being app. understood,<br>\
or perhaps it is correctly ضُمَّ,] The people, or<br>\

collected. (TA.) And اَللَّهُمَّ اضْمُمْ نَشَرِى (assumed tropical:)  O God,<br>\
compose what is discomposed, or disorganized, [lit.<br>\
bring together what is scattered,] of my affairs.<br>\
(K * and TA in art. نشر.) And ضُمَّ جَنَاحَكَ عَنِ<br>\
النَّاسِ (assumed tropical:)  [Contract thy side from men;] meaning<br>\

-b2-<br>\
[Also He compacted it: and he compressed it. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And He, or it, comprised it; or enclosed it: and<br>\
he grasped it: as also ضَمَّ عَلَيْهِ, in both of these<br>\
senses.] You say, ضَمَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الأَنَامِلُ The ends of<br>\

pronounced the letter with the vowel-sound termed<br>\
ضَمّ: and he marked the letter with the sign of<br>\

6<br>\
تَضَامُّوا They became, or drew, near, or close,<br>\
together, or one to another; or became conjoined,<br>\
one with another. (S, MA, TA. [See also 8.])<br>\
Hence the saying in a trad., لَا تَضَامُّونَ فِى رُؤْيَتِهِ<br>\
[originally تَتَضَامُّونَ]; but some relate it otherwise, saying ↓ لا تُضَامُّونَ; and some, لا تُضَامُونَ,<br>\
from الضَّيْمُ; (TA in this art.;) and some, لا<br>\
تُضَارُّونَ; and some, لا تُضَارُونَ, from الضَّيْرُ.<br>\
(TA in art. ضر: for explanations, see 3 in that<br>\
art.) See also 3 above. [Hence,] تضامّ فِى<br>\
سُجُودِهِ وَجُلُوسِهِ [He drew himself together in his<br>\
prostration and his sitting, in prayer]. (S, * and K<br>\
in art. حفز.)<br>\
7<br>\
انضمّ It was, or became, drawn, put,<br>\
brought, or gathered, together; collected; or contracted. (Msb.) انضمّ إِلَيْهِ is syn. with ضَامَّهُ,<br>\
q. v. (S, * MA, K. *) [And it signifies also He<br>\
adjoined himself, got him or got himself, betook<br>\
him or betook himself, repaired, or resorted, to<br>\
him, or it. And انضمّ عَلَيْهِ It became drawn<br>\
together upon it. انضمّ الى كَذَا is expl. in the<br>\
TA as meaning اِنْطَوَى: but I think that الى is<br>\
evidently a mistranscription for عَلَى; and that<br>\
the meaning therefore is, It infolded such a thing,<br>\
or enclosed it, like اضطمّ عليه, q. v.]<br>\
8<br>\
اضطمّ الشَّىْءَ He drew, brought, or gathered,<br>\
the thing to himself: (K:) the ط is substituted<br>\
for ت because of the ض. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\

near, or close, one to another]. (TA. [See also<br>\
6.]) And, in another trad., اضطمّ عَلَيْهِ النَّاسُ<br>\
The people, or men, pushed, pressed, crowded, or<br>\
thronged, together upon him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
اضطمّ عَلَيْهِ It comprised it, or enclosed it. (K.)<br>\
You say, اِضْطَمَّتْ عَلَيْهِ الضُّلُوعُ The ribs comprised it, or enclosed it. (S. [See also 7.])<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
ضَمْضَمَ عَلَى المَالِ He took all the<br>\
property; (K;) as though he drew it, or<br>\
gathered it, (ضَمَّهُ,) to himself. (TA.) [See also<br>\
