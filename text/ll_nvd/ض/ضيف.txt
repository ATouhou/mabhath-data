places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ضَيَّفْتُهُ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  I protected him, or defended him, from him who sought,<br>\

secure, or free from fear; and became at peace<br>\

3<br>\
ضايفهُ [app. signifies He straitened him:<br>\
(see 6:) or, perhaps, he became his guest; like<br>\
ضَافَهُ, &amp;c]. ―<br>\

Also, said of a man, He ran, and hastened, made<br>\
haste, or sped, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K,) and fled, or<br>\
turned away and fled: (K:) and said of a dog<br>\
as meaning he ran away, or fled. (TA in art.<br>\
جبن.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اضاف عَلَى الشَّىْءِ i. q. أَشْرَفَ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
[He looked upon, or viewed, the thing from above:<br>\
or he was, or became, on the brink, or verge, or<br>\
at the point, of the thing: &amp;c.]. (O, K, * TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  تُضِيفُ إِلَى صَوْتِ الفَحْلِ, said of a she-camel,<br>\
means She hears with desire of going to him the<br>\
voice, or sound, of the stallion. (M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
الإِضَافَةُ and ↓ التَّضَايُفُ signify Correlation, or<br>\
reciprocal relation, so that one of the two cannot<br>\
be conceived in the mind without the other; as in<br>\
the case of الأُبُوَّةُ and البُنُوَّةُ [i. e. fathership and<br>\
sonship]. (KT. [See also 3.])<br>\
-A2-  اضافهُ إِلَيْهِ He<br>\
made it to incline towards it; (S, M, * O, Msb,<br>\
K; *) namely, a thing (S, O) to a thing. (S, O,<br>\
Msb.) He made it to lean, rest, or stay itself,<br>\
against it, or upon it. (M, TA.) You say,<br>\
اضاف ظَهْرَهُ إِلَى الحَائِطِ He leaned his back against<br>\
the wall. (MA.) And اضاف إِلَيْهِ أَمْرًا (tropical:)  He<br>\
rested, or stayed, upon him an affair, and desired<br>\
him to do what would suffice. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
He made him to have recourse to it, or to betake<br>\
himself to it for refuge. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He<br>\
adjoined it to it. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And hence الإِضَافَةُ<br>\
as a conventional term of the grammarians;<br>\
because the first [of two nouns in the case to<br>\
which it applies] is adjoined to the second:<br>\
(Msb:) [for] إِضَافَةُ الاِسْمِ إِلَى الاِسْمِ is [The prefixing the noun to the noun so that the former<br>\
governs the latter in the gen. case] as when you<br>\
say غُلَامُ زَيْدٍ; in which instance, غلام is termed<br>\
↓ مُضَافٌ, and زيد is termed إِلَيْهِ ↓ مُضَافٌ: and<br>\
this is done for the purpose of particularizing or<br>\
appropriating, and of making known or definite:<br>\
therefore the إِضَافَة of a thing to itself [i. e. the<br>\
prefixing a noun in this manner to one identical<br>\
therewith in meaning] is not allowable, because a<br>\
thing does not make known, or definite, itself;<br>\
(S;) unless by an ellipsis, as when you say<br>\
حَقُّ اليَقِينِ for حَقُّ الشَّىْءِ اليَقِينِ; or, accord. to<br>\
Fr, the Arabs used to do so because of the difference of the two words themselves. (S voce<br>\
جَامِعٌ.) [الإِضَافَةُ is also often used as meaning<br>\
The state of being prefixed in the manner explained above; or the connection of a noun so<br>\
prefixed with its complement. The various kinds<br>\
of إِضَافَة are sufficiently explained in the grammars of De Sacy and others: they are not<br>\
proper subjects of a lexicon, though much is said<br>\
respecting them in the O, and more in the Msb.<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  Hence also, بِالإِضَافَةِ إِلَى كَذَا meaning In<br>\
comparison with (lit. to), or in relation to, (like<br>\
بِالنِّسْبَةِ إِلَى,) such a thing; as though in juxtaposition to it: a phrase of frequent occurrence: see<br>\
an ex. in Bd ii. 6.] ―<br>\
-b6-  أَضَفْتُهُ (inf. n. إِضَافَةٌ, Msb)<br>\
and ↓ ضَيَّفْتُهُ (inf. n. تَضْيِيفٌ, O) both signify the<br>\
same, (S, M, O, Msb, K,) from الضِّيَافَةُ; (O;)<br>\
i. e. both signify I made him a guest, or lodged<br>\
him, or gave him refuge or asylum, syn. أَنْزَلْتُهُ,<br>\
(S, M, Msb,) with me, as a ضَيْف [or guest], (S,)<br>\
and entertained him: (S, M, Msb:) أَضَافُوهُ and<br>\
↓ ضَيَّفُوهُ both signify أَنْزَلُوهُ: (Mgh:) accord. to<br>\
Th, أَضَفْتُهُ signifies I lodged him at my abode as<br>\
a ضَيْف: and I gave him (i. e. one in fear) protection, or refuge or asylum: (Msb:) and<br>\
↓ ضَيَّفْتُهُ is also expl. as meaning I fed him: and<br>\
↓ ضيّفهُ as meaning he made him to be in the condition of أَضْيَاف [or guests]. (TA.)<br>\

-b2-  تَضَيُّفٌ signifies also The being collected<br>\
together. (KL, from the Mj.) ―<br>\

see 1, latter half, in four places.<br>\
6<br>\
تَضَاْيَفَ see 4.<br>\
-A2-  تضايف as said of a valley, [from<br>\
ضِيفٌ “ a side,”] It became narrow; syn. تَضَايَقَ.<br>\
(S, M, O.) تَضَايَفْنَ عَلَيْهِ, a phrase used by a<br>\
poet [describing camels following an old camel],<br>\
They became near to him, (S, M, O,) by his side.<br>\
(S, M.) And you say, تضايفهُ القَوْمُ The people,<br>\
or party, became on both sides of him (بِضِيفَيْهِ).<br>\
(TA.) And تَضَايفُه السَّبُعَانِ The two beasts of<br>\
prey hemmed him in on both sides. (TA.) And<br>\
تَضَايَفَتِ الكِلَابُ الصَّيْدَ and تَضَايَفَتْ عَلَيْهِ [The<br>\
dogs hemmed in the object of the chase on both<br>\
sides, or round about]. (TA.) [In the TA, all<br>\
these are said to be tropical; but why, I see not.]<br>\
7<br>\
انضاف إِلَيْهِ signifies He, or it, became<br>\
joined, or adjoined, or added, to him, or it: and<br>\
he joined himself to him: but is perhaps postclassical.]<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَضْيَفَ see 1, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also<br>\
اِسْتَضَافَنِى, meaning He desired me, or asked me,<br>\
to grant him protection, or refuge. (Msb.) And<br>\
استضاف فُلَانٌ إِلَى فُلَانٍ Such a one had recourse,<br>\
or betook himself, to such a one for protection, or<br>\
refuge. (IAar, M.)<br>\
ضَيْفٌ A guest: and guests: (MA:) so called<br>\
because adjoined to the family and fed with them:<br>\
(Ham p. 124:) it is applied to one, and to a pl.<br>\
number, (S, M, MA, O, Msb, K,) and to a male<br>\
and to a female, (S, O, Msb, K,) because it is<br>\
originally an inf. n.: (MA, Msb:) [as a sing.,]<br>\
i. q. ↓ مُضَيَّفٌ, (M,) which is syn. with نَزِيلٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and applied to a pl. number, it may be<br>\
pl. [or rather a quasi-pl. n.] of ↓ ضَائِفٌ, which is<br>\
syn. with نَازِلٌ; thus being of the class of زَوْزٌ<br>\
and صَوْمٌ: (M:) and it is also pluralized, having<br>\
for its pls. أَضْيَافٌ and ضِيفَانٌ (S, M, MA, O,<br>\
Msb, K) and ضُيُوفٌ (S, M, MA, O, K) and ضِيَافٌ,<br>\
(MA, TA,) the first of which is properly a pl. of<br>\
pauc., but is also used as a pl. of mult.: (M:)<br>\
and a female is termed ضَيْفَةٌ as well as ضَيْفٌ: (S,<br>\
M, O, Msb, K:) El-Ba&#39;eeth says,<br>\
لَقًى حَمَلَتْهُ أُمُّهُ وَهْىَ ضَيْفَةٌ<br>\
[A castaway with whom his mother became pregnant while she was a guest]: (S, M, O:) or,<br>\
accord. to AHeyth, the meaning here is that<br>\
which follows. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ضَيْفَةٌ applied to a woman<br>\
signifies also Menstruating: (O, K:) so says<br>\
AHeyth with reference to the citation above from<br>\
El-Ba&#39;eeth. (O.)<br>\
ضِيفٌ The side (T, S, M, O, K) of a valley<br>\
(T, M) and of a mountain (M) [&amp;c.: see 6]:<br>\
and, as metaphorically used by an anonymous<br>\
poet, of the ذَكَر: (M:) and ↓ مَضَايِفُ signifies<br>\
the sides of a valley. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And one says,<br>\
فُلَانٌ فِى ضِيفِ فُلَانٍ, meaning Such a one is in<br>\
the vicinage, or quarter, of such a one. (M.)<br>\
ضَيْفَنٌ One who comes with a guest: (S, O:)<br>\
or who so comes intruding without invitation:<br>\
(K:) or one who follows a guest: derived from<br>\
ضَيْفٌ, accord. to Sb; but said by AZ to belong<br>\
to art. ضفن: (M:) [accord. to J and Sgh] the<br>\
ن is augmentative: the pl. is ضَيَافِنُ. (S, O.)<br>\
ضِيَافَةٌ an inf. n. of ضِفْتُهُ in the first of the senses<br>\
assigned to the latter above. (S, M, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[And] a subst. from أَضَفْتُهُ and ضَيَّفْتُهُ [as such<br>\
signifying The entertainment of a guest or guests;<br>\
i. e. the act of entertaining: and an entertainment as meaning a repast, given to a guest or<br>\
guests; a banquet, or feast]. (Msb.) [Hence,<br>\
دَارُ الضِّيَافَةِ The house of entertainment of guests.]<br>\
ضَائِفٌ A man alighting as a guest; syn. نَازِلٌ:<br>\
(M, TA:) see ضَيْفٌ: its [proper] pl. is ضُيَّفٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُضَافٌ; and مُضَافٌ إِلَيْهِ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  The former<br>\
signifies also (tropical:)  One who is made an adjunct, or<br>\
adherent, to a people, or party, (S, M, O, K, TA,)<br>\
and made to incline to them, (M,) not being of<br>\
them. (M, TA.) One says, مَا هُوَ إِلَّا مُضَافٌ (tropical:)  [He<br>\
is none other than an adjunct, or adherent].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  One whose origin, or lineage, or<br>\
parentage, is suspected; or who makes a claim to<br>\
relationship not having it: (O, K, TA:) and (K)<br>\

-b4-  And One who is constrained to<br>\
betake himself to a place of refuge, (M, O, K,<br>\

وَيَحْمِى المُضَافَ إِذَا مَا دَعَا<br>\
[And he protects him who is constrained to betake<br>\
himself to a place of refuge, when he calls for<br>\
aid]. (M.) And ↓ مُسْتَضَافٌ signifies the same<br>\
as مُضَافٌ [app. in the last of the senses expl.<br>\
above]: so says IB; and he cites the saying of<br>\
Jowwás Ibn-Heiyán El-Azdee,<br>\
عِ وَأَحْمِى المُسْتَضَافَا ↓ وَلَقَدْ أَقْدَمُ فِى الرَّوٌ<br>\

beset, hemmed in, or encompassed, in war, or<br>\

[accord. to Freytag, as from the Deewán of the<br>\

أَنْتَ تُجِيبُ دَعْوَةَ المَضُوفِ<br>\
[Thou answerest the prayer, or call, of him who<br>\
is beset &amp;c.]; and is formed after the manner of<br>\
بُوعَ for بِيعَ. (M, TA.)<br>\
مَضِيفٌ a dial. var. of مَصِيفٌ [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
[ISd says that] مَضِيفًا occurring in a verse of<br>\
Aboo-Dhu-eyb [as some relate it], cited voce<br>\
كَرَبَةٌ, [where the reading of مَصِيفًا is given,] is<br>\

same. (S, L, TA.)<br>\
