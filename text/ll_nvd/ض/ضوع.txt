cited voce رَيَّا, in art. روى: [in which, in the<br>\
place of تَضَوَّعَ, some read يَضَّوَّعُ, for يَتَضَوَّعُ:]<br>\

(O, K;) as when said of a child; and so ↓ انضاع,<br>\
said of both: (K:) or ↓ انضاع, said of a young<br>\
bird, (S, O, K,) as also تضوّع, (O, K,) signifies<br>\
it spread its wings to its mother in order that she<br>\

species of owl, i. e.,] of the kind termed هَام: (S,<br>\
O, Msb:) or [a male owl;] the male of the بُوم;<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K;) accord. to El-Mufaddal: (S,<br>\
O:) said by ADk to be a bird that utters a<br>\
scream when it perceives the daybreak: (O:) or<br>\
the كَرَوَان [a name now given to the stonecurlew, or charadrius œdicnemus]: (K:) or a<br>\
certain black bird, resembling the غُرَاب [or crow],<br>\
(Et-Táïfee, O, K,) smaller than this, but red in<br>\
its wings, these being of a roseate colour: so says<br>\
AHát, on the authority of Et-Táïfee: accord. to<br>\
others, he says, it is a small bird, less than the<br>\
دُخَّل and the حُمَّر; (O;) and in like manner<br>\
says Th: (TA:) also that the ↓ ضُوَعَة [which<br>\
may be the fem. or a n. un.] is of a colour inclining to yellow, dusky and blackish externally,<br>\
and yellow and ash-coloured within, short in the<br>\
neck and tail, smaller than the sparrow; and<br>\
that it is thus called because of the cry that it<br>\
utters at the commencement of daybreak: accord.<br>\
to El-Hanashee, the ضُوَع is a bird such as is<br>\
termed أَبْغَث [q. v.], resembling the domestic hen,<br>\
(O,) the flesh of which is good: (O, K:) but he<br>\
adds that it has been said by some to be not a<br>\
bird: and in another place of the book he says<br>\
that the ↓ ضُوَعَة is black, like the غُرَاب, a little<br>\
larger than the ضُجْرَة, red in the خَوَافِق: (O:<br>\
[but الخَوَافِق is an obvious mistranscription for<br>\
الخَوَافِى: see خَافِيَةٌ:)] the pl. is أَضْوَاعٌ [a pl. of<br>\
pauc.] and ضِيعَانٌ. (S, O, Msb, K.)<br>\
ضُوَعَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\

K:) or emaciated: (TA:) app. from ضَاعَ said<br>\
