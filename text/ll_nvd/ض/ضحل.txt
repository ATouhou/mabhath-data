Q. Q. 4<br>\
اِضْمَحَلَّ, (S, O, K,) mentioned in the<br>\
K in a separate art., its author, and some others,<br>\
holding the م to be radical, but most of the leading authorities on inflection hold it, with J [and<br>\
Sgh and Fei], to be augmentative; (TA;) and<br>\
اِمْضَحَلَّ, (S, O, Msb, K,) of the dial. of the Kilá-<br>\
bees, mentioned by AZ, formed by transposition<br>\
of the م; (S, O, TA;) and اِمْضَحَنَّ, (K,) formed<br>\
by substitution, mentioned by Yaakoob; (TA;)<br>\
It (a thing, S, O) went away; (S, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
and came to nought. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And said of<br>\
clouds (سَحَاب), They became removed, or cleared<br>\
off. (S, O, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And i. q. اِنْحَلَّ [It became untied, or undone, &amp;c.]. (K.)<br>\
ضَحْلٌ A small quantity of water, (S, M, O, K,)<br>\
upon the ground, (M, K,) shallow, (M,) not deep;<br>\
(K;) i. q. ضَحْضَاحٌ; (S, O;) or the latter has a<br>\
more general meaning, applying to little or much:<br>\
(TA:) accord. to some, such that the bottom of<br>\
it appears: (MF, TA:) or a small quantity of<br>\
water in a source, or fountain, and in a well, and<br>\
in a hot spring, and the like; or in a pool left by<br>\
a torrent, and the like: or water little in quantity;<br>\
or near in place: (TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَضْحَالٌ<br>\
and [of mult.] ضُحُولٌ and ضِحَالٌ. (K.) ―<br>\

mass of rock of which part is covered by the<br>\
water and part is protruding; (O;) expl. [more<br>\
fully and variously] in art. اتن; (K;) so called<br>\
because the water does not cover it by reason of<br>\
its paucity. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] one says,<br>\
إِنَّ خَيْرَكَ لَضَحْلٌ i. e. [(assumed tropical:)  Verily thy goodness, or<br>\
bounty, or beneficence, is] little. (TA.)<br>\

ضَحَا الطَّرِيقُ, (S, K,) aor. يَضْحُو, (S,) inf. n.<br>\
ضَحْوٌ, (S, and so in the CK,) or ضُحُوٌّ, (so in<br>\
other copies of the K and in the TA,) like عُلُوٌّ,<br>\
thus accord. to ISd and IKtt, (TA,) and ضُحِىٌّ,<br>\
(TA as from the K, [but not in the CK nor in<br>\
my MS. copy of the K,]) The road appeared, or<br>\
became apparent, (S, K,) to a person: so says<br>\
AZ: (S:) [and so, app., signifies ضَحِىَ, aor.<br>\
يَضْحَى; for] As says, يُسْتَحَبُّ مِنَ الفَرَسِ أَنْ<br>\
يَضْحَى عِجَانُهُ i. e. [It is approved as a quality<br>\
of the horse] that his عجان [q. v., a word<br>\
variously expl.,] appear. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ضَحِيَتِ<br>\
اللّيْلَةُ The night was, or became, cloudless. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  ضَحِىَ الفَرَسَ The horse was, or became, white.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  ظِلُّهُ ضَحَا (tropical:)  He died: (K, TA:) it<br>\
[properly] means his shade, or shadow, became<br>\
sun: and when a man&#39;s shade, or shadow,<br>\
becomes sun, he himself becomes nought. (IAmb,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And ضَحَا and ضَحِىَ, aor. of each<br>\
يَضْحَى, inf. n. ضَحْوٌ, (K, TA,) or, accord. to<br>\
the M, ضُحُوٌّ, (TA,) and ضُحِىٌّ, He, or it, was<br>\
smitten by the sun; or the sun came, or fell, upon<br>\
him, or it: (K, TA:) or ضَحِىَ, aor. يَضْحَى, inf. n.<br>\
ضَحًا; and ضَحَا, aor. يَضْحُو, inf. n. ضَحْوٌ and ضُحُوٌّ,<br>\
he, or it, was smitten by the heat of the sun.<br>\
(Ham p. 625.) Hence, in the Kur [xx. 117],<br>\
لَا تَظْمَأُ فِيهَا وَلَا تَضْحَى [Thou shalt not thirst.<br>\
therein nor shalt thou be smitten by the sun];<br>\
i. e., thou shalt be preserved from the heat of the<br>\
sun. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And ضَحَا, inf. n. ضَحْوٌ and ضُحُوٌّ<br>\
and ضُحِىٌّ, He went forth to the sunshine; (K;)<br>\
as also لِلشَّمْسِ ↓ استضحى; (TA;) [and app.<br>\
↓ تضحّى also; see Har p. 296, where, for النزول,<br>\
in النزول للشمس as an explanation of التَّضَحِّى, I<br>\
think we should read البُرُوزُ:] or ضَحِيتُ لِلشَّمْسِ,<br>\
inf. n. ضَحَآءٌ; and ضَحَيْتُ also; aor. of each<br>\
أَضْحَى; I went forth to the sunshine. (S.) أَضْحِ<br>\
[the imperative of ↓ أَضْحَى] occurs in a trad.,<br>\
accord. to the relaters thereof: but As says that<br>\
it is [correctly] اِضْحَ, with kesr to the ا and fet-h<br>\
to the ح; from ضَحِيتُ; being a command to go<br>\
forth to the sunshine. (S.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And ضَحِىَ, (S,<br>\
K,) inf. n. ضَحًى [or ضَحًا], He (a man, S)<br>\
sweated. (S, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
ضَحَّيْنَاهُمْ is like صَبَّحْنَاهُمْ [i. e. it signifies<br>\
We came to them in the time of the morning<br>\
called الضُّحَى]: (TA:) and ↓ ضاحاهُ, (K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. مُضَاحَاةٌ, is similar to غَادَاهُ and رَاوَحَهُ,<br>\
meaning, (TA,) He came to him in the time<br>\
called الضُّحَى. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ضحّى الغَنَمَ He<br>\
pastured the sheep, or goats, in the time called<br>\
الضُّحَى; (S, K, TA;) and in like manner, الإِبِلَ<br>\
the camels. (TA.) And ضَحَّيْتُ الإِبِلَ عَنِ الوِرْدِ<br>\
I pastured the camels with the [morning-pasture<br>\
called] ↓ ضَحَآء, so that they might come to the<br>\
water having satisfied themselves with food: and<br>\
in like manner, عَشَّيْتُهَا عَنْهُ “ I pastured them with<br>\
the [evening-pasture called] عَشَآء,” &amp;c. (A, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] ضَحَّيْتُهُ, inf. n. تَضْحِيَةٌ, I fed him in<br>\
the time called الضُّحَى: (K, TA:) or I fed him<br>\
with the [morning-meal called] غَدَآء, at any time<br>\
[of the morning]; but more commonly known as<br>\
meaning, in the time called الضُّحَى: and the<br>\
verb primarily relates to camels [and sheep or<br>\
goats]: or ضحّى قَوْمَهُ means he fed his people, or<br>\
party, with the [morning-meal called] غَدَآء; or<br>\
he invited them [thereto, i. e.] to his ضَحَآء. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  IAth says, when the Arabs, in their journeying, or migrating, passed by a piece of land in<br>\
which was herbage, one of them said, أَلَا ضَحُّوا<br>\
رُوَيْدًا, meaning [Now] be ye gentle with the camels<br>\
↓ حَتَّى نَتَضَحَّى i. e. in order that we may obtain<br>\
of this herbage; then التَّضْحِيَةُ was applied to<br>\
mean the being gentle in order that the camels<br>\
may reach the place of alighting [app. in the<br>\
morning] having satisfied themselves with food:<br>\
and then ↓ تَضَحَّى was said of anyone as meaning<br>\
he ate in the time called [الضُّحَى or] الضَّحَآء.<br>\
(TA.) One says, ضَحَّيْتُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ (assumed tropical:)  I was<br>\
gentle, or I acted gently, with the thing. (S.)<br>\
And ضحّى عَنِ الأَمْرِ (tropical:)  He acted gently, or deliberately, in the affair: and so عَشَّى عَنْهُ. (A,<br>\
TA.) And ضَحِّ رُوَيْدًا, (S, A, TA,) a prov.,<br>\
(A, TA,) meaning (tropical:)  Hasten thou not; (S, TA;)<br>\
from تَضْحِيَةُ الإِبِلِ عَنِ الوِرْدِ: [see the third<br>\
sentence of this paragraph:] or meaning be thou<br>\
patient a little while: (TA:) or the meaning is,<br>\
slaughter thou, or sacrifice thou, [deliberately,<br>\
leisurely, or] without haste: (Meyd:) [for] ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
ضحّى, inf. n. تَضْحيَةٌ, signifies [also] He slaughtered, or sacrificed, the [victim termed] أُضْحِيَّة, in<br>\
the time called الضُّحَى: and hence, by reason of<br>\
frequency of usage, he did so in any time of what<br>\
are termed أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ: (Msb:) and ضحّى<br>\
بِشَاةٍ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) or بِكَبْشٍ أَوْ غَيْرِهِ, (Mgh,)<br>\
he slaughtered, or sacrificed, a sheep or goat, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) or a ram or other [victim], (Mgh,) in<br>\
the time called الضُّحَى (Mgh, K) of the day called<br>\
يَوْمُ الأَضْحَى; and afterwards said of him who<br>\
has done so [at any time, even] in the last part<br>\
of the [said] day. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 4.<br>\
-A3-  And<br>\
see 5.<br>\
3<br>\
ضاحت البِلَدُ The countries, or lands, became exposed to the sun, and their herbage consequently dried up. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  ضاحاهُ: see 2, first<br>\
sentence.<br>\
4<br>\
اضحى He (a man, TA) entered upon the<br>\
time of morning called الضُّحَى, (K, * TA,) or the<br>\
time called الضَّحْوَة, (TA,) [or the time called<br>\
الضَّحَآء, for] you say, أَقَمْتُ بِالمَكَانِ حَتَّى أَضْحَيْتُ,<br>\
from الضَّحَآءُ [and therefore meaning I remained<br>\
in the place until I entered upon the time called<br>\
الضَّحَآء], like as you say أَصْبَحْتُ from الصَّبَاحُ.<br>\
(S, TA.) Hence the saying of &#39;Omar, أَضْحُوا<br>\
لِصَلَاةِ الضُّحَى, (S,) or بِصَلَاةِ الضُّحَى, (TA,) i. e.<br>\
Perform ye the prayer of the time called الضحى<br>\
at its [proper] time: do not delay it until the<br>\
time called الضَّحَآء has become advanced: (TA:)<br>\
or do not perform that prayer when the time called<br>\
الضُّحَى has become advanced. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And you<br>\
say, اضحى فُلَانٌ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا, (S, M, K,) like as<br>\
you say ظَلَّ يفعل كذا; (S;) meaning Such a<br>\
one became occupied, or engaged, in the time called<br>\
الضُّحَى in doing such a thing: (M, K, TA:) or<br>\
did such a thing in the first part of the day,<br>\
(IKtt, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [This phrase often means also<br>\
Such a one became occupied, or engaged, in doing<br>\
such a thing; betook, set, or applied, himself to<br>\
doing such a thing; set about, or commenced,<br>\
doing such a thing; or began to do such a thing;<br>\
like أَصْبَحَ and ظَلَّ &amp;c. And, like these verbs,<br>\
اضحى followed by an aor., or by a part. n. in<br>\
the accus. case, often requires to be rendered<br>\
simply He, or it, became: see an ex. in a verse<br>\
cited voce دَفِئٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  اضحى also signifies He<br>\
performed the supererogatory act of prayer<br>\
(النَّافِلَة) in the time called الضُّحَى. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
See also 1, last sentence but one. ―<br>\
-b6-  One says<br>\
also, اضحى عَنِ الأَمْرِ, meaning (tropical:)  He withdrew<br>\
himself far from the affair. (TA. [See also<br>\
another meaning of this phrase in what follows.])<br>\
And القَطا يُضْحِى عَنِ المَآءِ (tropical:)  The birds called قطا<br>\
go far from water. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اضحى الشَّىْءَ He<br>\
made apparent, showed, or revealed, the thing.<br>\
(K, TA.) And عَنِ الأَمْرِ ↓ ضحّى He made the<br>\
affair, or case, apparent, or manifest: and [so<br>\
اضحى عَنْهُ, for] one says, أَضْحِ لِى عَنْ أَمْرِكَ,<br>\
with fet-h to the ء, meaning Make manifest to me<br>\
thy affair, or case: so in the M. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  لَا أَضْحَى<br>\
اللّٰهُ لَنَا ظِلَّكَ is a deprecatory phrase [lit. May God<br>\
not cause thy shadow to become sun to us: meaning (assumed tropical:)  may God not deprive us of thee by death:<br>\
(see ضَحَا ظِلُّهُ:) or it may be similar in meaning<br>\
to the phrase here following]. (TA.) لَا تُضْحِنَا<br>\
عَنْ ظِلِّكَ [lit. Make us not to go forth into the<br>\
sun from thy shadow] means (assumed tropical:)  withdraw not<br>\
from us the shadow of thy compassion: the verb<br>\
being made trans. by means of عن because the<br>\
phrase implies the meaning of لَا تُخْرِجْنَا مِنْهُ: and<br>\
ظلّ being here used metaphorically. (Har p. 4.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَضحّى: see 1, latter half. ―<br>\
-b2-  And see 2,<br>\
in two places. It [generally] means He ate in<br>\
the time of morning called الضُّحَى: (K:) or he<br>\
ate the [morning-meal called] غَدَآء; syn. تَغَدَّى:<br>\
(S, TA:) and ↓ ضحّى also has the former [or<br>\
the latter] meaning. (ISd, TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَ1ْ2َ3َ see 1, latter half.<br>\
ضَحْوٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
ضُحًى, also written ضُحًا, held by some to be<br>\
of the measure فُعَلٌ, and by others to be [originally ضُحْوًى i. e.] of the measure فُعْلًى, of<br>\
the former measure accord. to Mbr, and of the<br>\
latter accord. to Th, (MF, TA,) [The early<br>\
part of the forenoon, after sunrise: accord. to<br>\
some, when the sun is yet low: accord. to others,<br>\
when the sun is somewhat high:] i. q. ↓ ضَحْوَةٌ,<br>\
accord. to most authorities: (MF, TA, and so<br>\
in one place in the K:) or this latter signifies<br>\
the period of the day after sunrise: (S:) or<br>\
this signifies the advanced state of the day<br>\
(اِرْتِفَاعُ النَّهَارِ [which is said by the doctors of<br>\
the law in the present day to mean when the sun<br>\
has risen the measure of a رُمْح, q. v., or more]);<br>\
as also ↓ ضَحْوٌ and ↓ ضَحِيَّةٌ: (K:) and the ضُحَى<br>\
is after the ضَحْوَة (S, K) a little, (K,) when<br>\
the sun shines brightly: (S:) or from sunrise to<br>\
the time when the day is advanced and very<br>\
white: thus in the M: (TA:) or it is the<br>\
spreading of the sun [upon the earth], and the<br>\
extending of the day: and the time [thereof]<br>\
is thus named: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or ضُحًى is<br>\
pl. of ↓ ضَحْوَةٌ, like as قُرًى is of قَرْيَةٌ; and its<br>\
sing. is like ↓ ضَحَآءٌ, which means the extending<br>\
of the day, and is of the masc. gender, as though<br>\
a name of the time [thereof]: then ضُحًى became<br>\
used as a sing., and the time was thus called:<br>\
(Msb:) it is fem. and masc.: (S, K: *) he who<br>\
makes it fem. holds it to be pl. of ↓ ضَحْوَةٌ;<br>\
and he who makes it masc. holds it to be [a<br>\
sing.] noun of the measure فُعَلٌ, like صُرَدٌ and<br>\
نُغَرٌ: (S:) its dim. is ↓ضُحَىٌّ, without ة; (Fr,<br>\
Msb, K;) for they disapproved the affixing the<br>\
ة lest it should be confounded with the dim. of<br>\
ضَحْوَةٌ. (Fr, Msb.) Using it as an adv. noun,<br>\
you say, لَقِيتُهُ ضُحَى, when you mean [I met<br>\
him] in the ضحى of this day; without tenween.<br>\
(S, TA.) See also ضَحْوَةٌ. [See also De Sacy&#39;s<br>\
Chrest. Ar., sec. ed., i. 162-167, respecting the<br>\
prayer that is performed in the time thus called,<br>\
i. e. the prayer termed صَلَاةُ الضُّحَى, mentioned<br>\
above, voce أَضْحَى.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The sun: (M,<br>\
Msb, K:) because of its appearing in the time<br>\
thus called. (M, TA.) One says, اِرْتَفَعَتِ الضَّحَى,<br>\
meaning The sun became high. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
ضُحَى الشَّمْسِ The light of the sun: thus is<br>\
expl. xci. 1. of the Kur. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  مَا لِكَلَامِهِ<br>\
ضُحًى means (assumed tropical:)  His speech, or language, has no<br>\
perspicuity: thus in the M and K: but in the A,<br>\
↓ أَنْشَدَنِى شَعْرًا لَيْسَ فِيهِ حَلَاوَةٌ وَلَا ضَحَآءٌ i. e.<br>\
[He recited to me poetry] in which was no<br>\
[sweetness nor] plainness of meaning. (TA.)<br>\
ضَحْوَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph,<br>\
in three places. You say, أَتَيْتُكَ ضَحْوَةً, meaning<br>\
[I came to thee] in a [time called] ↓ ضُحًى [or<br>\
rather ضَحْوَة], (K, * TA,) with tenween, unless<br>\
you mean of this day [in which case you say<br>\
ضَحْوَةٌ, without tenween, like as you say in the<br>\
latter case ضُحَى]. (TA.)<br>\
ضَحْيَا and ضَحْيَآءُ fems. of أَضْحَى [q. v.].<br>\
ضَحْيَانٌ, which should by rule be ضَحْوَانٌ,<br>\
Anything exposing itself, or being exposed, to<br>\
the sun. (IJ, TA.) قُلَّةٌ ضَحْيَانَةٌ means [A<br>\
mountain-top] exposed to the sun: (S, K:) occurring in a saying of Taäbbata-sharrà. (S.) And<br>\
عَصًا ضَحْيَانَةٌ A staff, or stick, growing in the sun<br>\
so as to be matured thereby, and extremely hard.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also أَضْحَى. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A man who<br>\
eats in the time called الضُّحَى: fem. with ة. (K.)<br>\
ضَحَآءٌ, with medd, (S, Hr, Msb, TA,) and<br>\
fet-h, (Hr, Msb, TA, [erroneously written in<br>\
copies of the K with damm,]) The period [of<br>\
the forenoon] next after that called الضُّحَى;<br>\
i. e. when the day is at the highest: (S:) or<br>\
the period near midday: (K:) or the period<br>\
of the day when the sun has risen to the fourth<br>\
part of the sky: (TA:) see also ضُحًى, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, The [morning-meal called]<br>\
غَدَآء; because it is eaten in the time thus called.<br>\
(S, TA.) [And also applied to Pasture eaten<br>\
in that time:] see 2, third sentence.<br>\
ضُحَىٌّ dim. of ضُحًى, q. v. (Fr, Msb, K.)<br>\
ضَحِيَّةٌ: see ضُحًى:<br>\

-b2-  You say<br>\
مَكَانٌ ضاحٍ An outer, exterior, or exposed,<br>\
place: (S:) and أَرْضٌ ضَاحِيَةٌ Land not surrounded by a wall. (TA in art. حوط.) [And<br>\
particularly A place exposed to the sun.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence,] مَفَازَةٌ ضَاحِيَةُ الظِّلِّ [A desert, or waterless<br>\
desert,] having no shade or shadow; and ضَاحِيَةُ<br>\
الظِّلَالِ [having no shades or shadows]. (TA.)<br>\
And شَجَرَةٌ ضَاحِيَةٌ بِالظِّلِّ [if not a mistake for<br>\
ضَاحِيَةُ الظِّلِّ] A tree having no shade. (Har<br>\
p. 4.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And بَدَا بِضَاحِى رَأْسِهِ [He appeared<br>\
with, or he showed,] the side of his head. (TA.)<br>\
[See also the next paragraph.]<br>\
ضَاحِيَةٌ An outer, exterior, or exposed, side or<br>\
region or tract of anything: [pl. ضَوَاحٍ: whence]<br>\
one says, هُمْ يَنْزِلُونَ الضَّوَاحِىَ [They alight, or<br>\
abide, in the exterior tracts]. (S.) [Hence also,]<br>\
ضَوَاحِى الرُّومِ The exterior districts of the Greeks.<br>\
(K.) And الضَّاحِيَةُ مِنَ البَعْلِ What are in the<br>\
open country, of the palm-trees that imbibe with<br>\
their roots, without being watered: opposed to<br>\

ضمن, q. v.:) and الضَّوَاحِى مِنَ النَّخْلِ what are<br>\

of a subst. is predominant. (TA.) And ضَوَاحِى<br>\
قُرَيْشٍ Those [of Kureysh] who abide outside of<br>\
Mekkeh. (TA.) And هُوَ مِنْ أَهْلِ الضَّاحِيَةِ He<br>\

also signifies The parts, of a man, that stand out,<br>\
or are exposed, (K, TA,) to the sun, (TA,) such<br>\
as the shoulder-blades, and the shoulders: (K,<br>\
TA:) pl. of ضَاحِيَةٌ. (TA.) And The sides of a<br>\
watering-trough. (K.) And The heavens. (S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence also,] فَعَلَهُ ضَاحِيَةً He did it openly.<br>\
(S, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ضَاحِيَةُ المَالِ means The cattle, (K,)<br>\
or sheep or goats, (TA,) that drink in the time of<br>\
