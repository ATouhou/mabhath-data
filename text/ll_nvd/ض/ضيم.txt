ضَيْمٌ, (S, * Msb,) [as also ضَامَهُ, aor. يَضُومُهُ,<br>\
inf. n. ضَوٌْ, (see art. ضوم,)] He wronged him;<br>\
treated him wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or<br>\
tyrannically: (S:) he harmed, injured, hurt, or<br>\
damaged, him: (Msb:) and ↓ استضامهُ signifies<br>\
the same. (S.) And ضَامَهُ حَقَّهُ, (M, K,) aor. as<br>\
above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (M,) He defrauded him of his right, or due, partially or<br>\
wholly; (M, K;) as also ↓ استضامهُ. (K.) ―<br>\

And ضُمْتُ I was wronged, &amp;c.: of which there<br>\
are three dial. vars.; one says of a man ضِيمَ;<br>\
and ضُيْمَ, with [the pronunciation termed] إِشْمَام;<br>\
and ضُومَ; like as we have said respecting بِيعَ.<br>\
(S.) One says, مَا ضِمْتُ أَحَدً وَمَا ضُمْتُ [I have<br>\
not wronged any one, and I have not been wronged];<br>\
i. e. no one has wronged me. (TA.) It is said<br>\
in a trad., as some relate it, لَا تُضَامُونَ فِى رُؤْيَتِهِ<br>\
[or ↓ تُضَامُّونَ or ↓ تَضَامُّونَ Ye will not be<br>\
wronged in the seeing Him]. (M. [For other<br>\
readings and explanations of this trad., see 3 in<br>\
art. ضر.])<br>\

the latter occurring in the prov., تَأْتِى بِكَ الضَّامَةُ<br>\
عِرِّيسَ الأَسَدِ [The wrongdoers bring thee, or cause<br>\
thee to come, to the covert of the lion]; meaning,<br>\
the wrong of the wrongdoers requires thee to cast<br>\
thyself into destruction: applied in offering an<br>\
excuse for venturing upon that which is perilous:<br>\
or, as some relate it, الضَّامَّةُ, from الضَّمُّ; meaning<br>\
“ want, or the object of want, that brings thee<br>\
and causes thee to have recourse [to a thing]. ”<br>\
