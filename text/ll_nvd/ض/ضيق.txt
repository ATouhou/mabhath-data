ضَاقَ, aor. يَضِيقُ, inf. n. ضَيْقٌ (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K) and ضِيقٌ, (S, O, K,) or this latter is a simple<br>\
subst., (Msb,) It was, or became, narrow, or<br>\
strait; contr. of اِتَّسَعَ; (Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ تضيّق, [or rather this signifies it was, or became, rendered narrow, or strait, being quasipass. of 2,] and ↓ تضايق: (K:) it is said of a<br>\
thing, (S, O, Msb,) and of a place. (Msb.)<br>\
[See also ضَيْقٌ below.] ضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الْأَرْضُ, in the<br>\
Kur ix. 119, means The earth became strait to<br>\
them. (Bd, Jel.) And one says, ضَاقَتْ بِهِ الأَرْضُ<br>\
[meaning, in like manner, The earth, or land, became narrow, or strait, with him]: &#39;Amr Ibn-El-Ahtam says,<br>\
لَعَمْرُكَ مَا ضَاقَتْ بِلَادٌ بِأَهْلِهَا<br>\
وَلٰكِنَّ أَخْلَاقَ الرِّجَالِ تَضِيقُ<br>\
[By thy life, or by thy religion, countries have not<br>\
become narrow with their inhabitants, but the dispositions of the men become narrow]. (O, TA.)<br>\
[ضاق بِهِ often signifies, and so does به ↓ تضايق,<br>\
It was, or became, choked, surcharged, or overfilled, with it; for instance, a water-course with<br>\
water, and a place with people.] And ↓ تضايق<br>\
بِهِ الأَمْرُ means ضاق عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  [The affair was, or<br>\
became, strait to him]. (O, TA. [See an ex. in<br>\
art. رحب, conj. 6.]) One says also, ضاق عَلَيْهِ<br>\
مَعَاشُهُ: see 4. [And ضاق الوَقْتُ (assumed tropical:)  The time became strait, or contracted.] And ضاق صَدْرُهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  His bosom, or mind, became strait, or contracted: (Msb:) and ضاق عَنْهُ صَدْرُكَ (assumed tropical:)  [Thy<br>\
mind became so contracted as to be incapable of<br>\
it: or thy mind shrank from it]. (K.) [And<br>\
يَضِيقُ العَقْلُ عَنْ تَقْدِيرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  The intellect is incapable of determining its limit, or limits, or the like.]<br>\
And ضاق عَنِ الجَوَابِ and بِالجَوَابِ (assumed tropical:)  [He was<br>\
straitened, or embarrassed, so as to be unable to<br>\
reply, or to answer; he was incapable of replying,<br>\
or answering]: both signify the same. (TA in<br>\
art. زند.) And ضاق بالأَمْرِ ذَرْعًا, (S, * O, * Msb,)<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  The thing, or affair, was difficult, or<br>\
distressing, to him, (Msb,) originally ضاق ذَرْعُهُ بِهِ,<br>\
(S, * O, * Msb,) i. e. his ability [was straitened by<br>\
it, or was inadequate to it]; and his power:<br>\
(Msb:) or his art, or artifice, or cunning: or<br>\
his way, course, mode, or manner, of acting<br>\
(مَذْهَبُهُ) [was straitened, or rendered difficult, or<br>\
distressing, by it]. (O. [See more voce ذَرْعٌ:<br>\
and see a similar phrase in the Kur xi. 79 and<br>\
xxix. 32.]) And hence, app., the saying ضاق<br>\
المَالُ عَنِ الدُّيُونِ (tropical:)  The property was inadequate<br>\
to the debts. (Msb.) And you say, ضاق عَنْكَ<br>\
الشَّىْءُ [meaning لَمْ يَسَعْكَ (assumed tropical:)  The thing was not<br>\
allowable to thee]: one says, لَا يَسَعُنِى شَىْءٌ وَيَضِيقَ<br>\
عَنْكَ, (S, O, * TA, [in the O, erroneously, لا<br>\
يستغنى,]) i. e. وَأَنْ يَضِيقَ عَنْكَ (assumed tropical:)  [A thing will not<br>\
be allowable to me conjointly with its being disallowable to thee, وَأَنْ يَضِيقٌ meaning مَعَ ضَيْقِهِ]:<br>\
بَلْ مَتَى وَسِعَنِى شَىْءٌ وَسِعَكَ [but when a thing is<br>\
allowable to me, it is allowable to thee]. (S in<br>\
art. وسع.) And ضاق, (aor. يَضَِيقُ, K, inf. n.<br>\
ضِيقٌ, TA,) (tropical:)  He was or became, niggardly, or<br>\
avaricious. (S, O, Msb, K, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
ضيّقهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. تَضْيِيقٌ, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
He made it strait, or narrow; (Msb, K;)<br>\
namely, a place [&amp;c.]; (Msb;) as also ↓ اضاقهُ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. إِضَاقَةٌ. (TA.) You say, ضَيَّقْتُ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
المَكَانَ, (S,) or الشَّىْءَ, i. e. I straitened, or made<br>\
narrow, to him [the place, or the thing; or I<br>\
scanted it, or made it scanty]; contr. of وَسَّعْتُهُ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ. (O.) And ضَيَّقْتُ عَلَيْهِ [alone, used elliptically, I straitened him, properly speaking; and<br>\
also, (assumed tropical:)  his circumstances &amp;c.]. (Msb.) And ضُيِّقَ<br>\
عَلَى فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one was straitened]. (TA.)<br>\
لِتُضَيِّقُوا عَلَيْهِنَّ, in the Kur [lxv. 6, (assumed tropical:)  In order<br>\
that ye may straiten them], implies relation to<br>\
expenses and to the bosom. (TA.) [See 3.<br>\
التَّضْيِيقُ بَيْنَ شَيْئَيْنِ, occurring in the S and K in<br>\
art. حوص, means The making a coarctation<br>\
between two things.]<br>\
3<br>\
ضايقهُ He straitened him: (MA:) [see also<br>\
2: or, properly, he straitened him, being in like<br>\
manner straitened by him: see 1 in art. زحم: and]<br>\
(tropical:)  he treated him, or behaved towards him, with<br>\
hardness, or harshness; (O, * K, * TA;) فِى كَذَا<br>\
[in, or in respect of, such a thing]. (TA.)<br>\

اضاق (tropical:)  His means of living became strait<br>\
(عَلَيِْه مَعَاشُهُ ↓ ضَاقَ); (TA;) his property went<br>\
away; (S, O, Msb, K;) and he became poor.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 2.<br>\
5<br>\
تَضَيَّقَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
6<br>\
تَضَاْيَقَ see 1, in three places. تضايقوا They straitened one another; pushed, or pressed, one against<br>\
another; or crowded one another; in a place of<br>\
assembly; syn. زَحَمَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا: (Msb in art.<br>\
زحم:) or they became straitened in a place, or<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  in disposition. (S, O.)<br>\
10<br>\
استضاقت بِدُرْجَةٍ [She endeavoured to constrict her vagina by means of a pessary], (O, K,<br>\
TA,) or بِالأَدْوِيَةِ [by means of medicaments]; (A,<br>\
TA;) said of a woman. (A, O, K.)<br>\
ضَيْقٌ an inf. n. of 1, (S, O, Msb, K,) as also<br>\
↓ ضِيقٌ, (S, O, K,) or the latter is a simple subst.:<br>\
(Msb:) [both, used as simple substs., signify<br>\
Narrowness, or straitness:] accord. to Fr, [both<br>\
seem to signify thus; but the latter, properly;<br>\
and the former, tropically; for he says that]<br>\
الضَّيْقُ is in that which does not [really] become<br>\
wide, like the mind (الصَّدْر): (O:) or it is<br>\
مَا ضَاقَ عَنْهُ صَدْرُكَ [that of which the mind by its<br>\
being contracted is incapable, or from which the<br>\
mind shrinks; an explanation not given in the K<br>\
as on the authority of Fr, and deviating from<br>\
his words as given in the O; whence it appears<br>\
that, for مَا, we should perhaps read فِيمَا]: (K:)<br>\
but ↓ الضِّيقُ is in that which may be [really] wide,<br>\
like the house and the garment: (O, K:) and<br>\
the former [is also used as an epithet, being a<br>\
contraction of ضَيِّقٌ in this case, and as such]<br>\
has a dual and a plural and a feminine; but<br>\
the latter has not: (O:) or ↓ both are alike [in<br>\
signification]: (K:) and ↓ ضَيْقَةٌ is syn. with ضِيقٌ.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, and ↓ ضَيَقٌ, accord. to AA, (O,<br>\
[the latter there expressly said to be بِالتَّحْرِيكِ,])<br>\
or the former and ↓ ضِيقٌ, (K, [said in the TA to<br>\
be a mistake for ضَيَقٌ, but see what follows,])<br>\
Doubt (AA, O, K) in the heart: (K) the first<br>\
is more common than the second, in this sense;<br>\
and occurs in the Kur in xvi. last verse and<br>\
xxvii. 72: (O:) [but] Ibn-Ketheer read, in both<br>\
of these instances, ↓ ضِيق; and this and ضَيْق<br>\
are dial. vars. signifying straitness of mind. (Bd.)<br>\
-A2-  See also ضَيِّقٌ, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and ضَيْقَةٌ,<br>\
second sentence, in two places.<br>\
ضِيقٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in five<br>\
places.<br>\
ضَيَقٌ: see ضَيْقٌ, latter part.<br>\
ضَيْقَةٌ: see ضَيْقٌ, latter part. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (S)<br>\
(tropical:)  Poverty; and an evil state or condition; (S, O,<br>\
K, TA;) and so ↓ ضِيقَةٌ: (K, TA:) and the pl.<br>\
[or rather coll. gen. n.] (Fr, S, K, TA) of the<br>\
former (Fr, S, TA) is ↓ ضَيْقٌ: (Fr, S, K, TA:<br>\
[in the CK, erroneously, ضِيقٌ:]) Fr says, when<br>\
you see ↓ الضَّيْق to have occurred in the place of<br>\
الضِّيق, it is in [one of] two cases; either it is the<br>\
pl. [or coll. gen. n.] of الضَّيْقَةُ; or it means the<br>\
narrow, or strait, thing, ضَيْقٌ being a contraction<br>\
of ضَيِّقٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And الضَّيْقَةُ, (O,) or ضَيْقَةُ<br>\
[without the article], (JK, O, TA,) or ↓ الضِّيقَةُ,<br>\
(K, [app. a mistake, for in the O, in every case,<br>\
whether as a proper name or not, الضيقة is written<br>\
الضَّيْقَةُ,]) is the name of A certain mansion of the<br>\
moon, (JK, O, K, TA,) [not one of the Twentyeight Mansions,] close by الثُّرَيَّا [or the Pleiades]:<br>\
(JK, O, TA:) or, as IKt says, on the authority<br>\
of Ibn-Ziyád El-Kilábee, sometimes the moon<br>\
falls short of الدَّبَرَان and alights in الضيقة, i. e.<br>\
two small stars, near together, between الثُّرَيَّا and<br>\
الدَّابَرَان: (TA:) it is asserted by the Arabs to<br>\
be an inauspicious place. (O, * TA.) Hence the<br>\
saying of El-Akhtal,<br>\
فَهَلَّا زَجَرْتَ الطَّيْرَ لَيْلَةَ جِئْتَهَا<br>\
بِضَيْقَةَ بَيْنَ النَّجْمِ وَالدَّبَرَانِ<br>\
[And wherefore didst not thou draw an omen<br>\
from the flight of birds on the night when thou<br>\
camest to her, when the moon was in Deykah,<br>\
between the Pleiades and Ed-Debarán?]: he<br>\
notifies that the moon, in the night of their<br>\
coming together, was making its abode [in the<br>\
neighbourhood of] الدبران, which is inauspicious:<br>\
(O, TA:) or [the latter hemistich, as J relates it,<br>\
app. on the authority of A &#39;Obeyd, is thus,]<br>\
بِضَيْقَةِ بَيْنَ النَّجْمِ وَالدَّبَرَانِ<br>\
from الضَّيْقَةُ as syn. with الضَّيْقُ; (S;) and as<br>\
AA relates the verse, it is [thus] with kesr to the<br>\
ة in بضيقة; the word not being made the<br>\
[proper] name of a place, but the meaning being<br>\
بضيقة مَا بَيْنَ النجم والدبران [i. e. in the narrow<br>\
space between the Pleiades and Ed-Debarán].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  ضَيْقَةٌ is also the fem. of ضَيْقٌ the contracted form of ضَيِّقٌ. (S, O, TA.)<br>\
ضِيقَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, former<br>\
half, in two places.<br>\
ضُوقَى and ضِيقَى are fems. of ↓ أَضْيَقُ; (S, O,<br>\
K;) the former [as well as the latter] is<br>\
[originally] of the measure فُعْلَى, (TA,) [each<br>\
being originally ضُيْقَى,] the ى being changed<br>\
in the former into و because quiescent and preceded by dammeh: (S, O, TA:) the former<br>\
occurs in the saying of a woman to her fellowwife, contending with her for superiority,<br>\
مَا أَنْتِ بِالخُورَى وَلَا الضُّوقَى حِرًا<br>\
[Thou art not the better nor the narrower &amp;c.;<br>\
خُورَى being in like manner fem. of أَخْيَرُ]. (TA.)<br>\
Accord. to Kr, the former is pl. of ↓ ضَيِّقَةٌ;<br>\
(TA;) and he says the same of ضِيقَى also; (TA<br>\
voce كَيِّسٌ;) but ISd says, I know not how this<br>\
may be, for فُعْلَى is not of the measures of pls.<br>\
except of the kind of pl. which differs not from its<br>\
sing. otherwise than in the latter&#39;s having ة [as<br>\
an affix], like بُهْمَاةٌ and بُهْمَى [q. v.]. (TA in<br>\
the present art.)<br>\
ضِيَاقٌ: see مِضْيَاقٌ.<br>\
ضَائِقٌ: see the next paragraph, in four places.<br>\
ضَيِّقٌ and ↓ ضَيْقٌ, (S, O, K,) the latter a contraction of the former, (S,) the two being like<br>\
هَيِّنٌ and هَيْنٌ [&amp;c.], (O,) and ↓ ضَائِقٌ, (K,)<br>\
Narrow, or strait: (S, * O, * K:) or ضَيِّقٌ is an<br>\
epithet used in this sense when permanence [of<br>\
the attribute] is meant [and so therefore is<br>\
its contracted form]; and ↓ ضَائِقٌ as meaning<br>\
[being, or becoming, narrow or strait; or] temporarily narrow or strait: (Msb:) the fem. of<br>\
the first (TA) and of the second (S, O, TA) [as<br>\
well as of the third] is with ة: (S, O, TA:) see<br>\
also ضُوقَى: [the pls. of the first and second,<br>\
applied to rational beings, is ضَيِّقُونَ and ضَيْقُونَ,<br>\
like مَيِّتُونَ and مَيْتُونَ: and] the pl. of ↓ ضَائِقٌ is<br>\
ضَاقَةً. (TA.) You say شَىْءٌ ضَيِّقٌ (O, Msb) and<br>\
↓ ضَيْقٌ (O) A narrow, or strait, thing. (O, *<br>\
Msb.) And صَدْرٌ ضَيِّقٌ (assumed tropical:)  A strait, or contracted,<br>\
mind; (Msb;) and نَفْسٌ ضَيِّقَةٌ [meaning the<br>\
same]. (TA.) And بِهِ صَدْرُكَ ↓ وَضَائقٌ, in the<br>\
Kur [xi. 15], means (assumed tropical:)  And thy mind is temporarily strait or contracted thereby. (Msb.)<br>\
ضَيِّقٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  Niggardly, or avaricious.<br>\
(KL.) [And ضَيِّقُ الخُلُقِ (assumed tropical:)  Narrow, or illiberal,<br>\
in disposition.]<br>\
أَضْيَقُ [More, and most, narrow or strait or<br>\
contracted]: (S, O, K:) see its fems. ضُوقَى and<br>\
ضِيقَى, above. [See also three exs. voce اِسْتٌ,<br>\
in art. سته.]<br>\
مَضِيقٌ A narrow, or strait, place: (K:) [a<br>\
pass: a place of narrowness or straitness] of land;<br>\
and of the vulva; and (assumed tropical:)  [a place, or state, of<br>\
straitness] of life, or of the means of subsistence:<br>\
(K in art. ازم:) and (tropical:)  a narrow, or strait, affair<br>\
or case: (K, TA:) pl. مَضَايِقُ. (TA.)<br>\
أَمْرٌ مُضَيَّقٌ (assumed tropical:)  [An affair rendered strait]. (TA.)<br>\
مِضْيَاقٌ, (JK, and O on the authority of Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, and TA,) or ↓ ضِيَاقٌ, like كِتَابٌ [in<br>\
measure], thus in all the copies of the K, (TA,)<br>\
[but probably, I think, taken from a mistranscription,] A pessary (دُرْجَةٌ) of rag and perfume,<br>\
with which a woman endeavours to constrict her<br>\
vagina (تَسْتَضِيقُ بِهَا). (JK, Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
