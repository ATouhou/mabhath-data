ضَرَحَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
ضَرْحٌ, (S, A, O, L,) He removed it from its place;<br>\
put it away or aside; pushed, or thrust, it away:<br>\
(S, A, * O, L, K:) he took it, and threw it away<br>\
or aside: (L:) he pushed it, or thrust it, away<br>\
with his foot: (Expos. of the “ Amálee ” of El-<br>\
Kálee:) [and] ضَرَحَ بِالشَّىْءِ [if not a mistranscription for ضرح الشَّىْءَ] He threw [from him] the<br>\
thing; and put it away or aside: and ضَرَحَ عَنْهُ<br>\
الثَّوْبَ He cast off from him the garment. (A.)<br>\
See also 4. [And see 8.] [Hence] ضَرَحْتُ عَنِّى<br>\
شَهَادَةَ القَوْمِ (tropical:)  I invalidated the testimony of the<br>\
people or party, or annulled its claim to credibility,<br>\
(جَرَحْتُهَا,) and cast it from me, or rejected it: (S,<br>\
A, O, K: *) said by one against whom false<br>\
witness has been borne, and who has shown its<br>\
falseness. (A.) ―<br>\

O, K,) aor.<br>\
ضَرَحَ, (K, * TA,) inf. n. ضَرْحٌ (S, O) and<br>\
ضِرَاحٌ, (S, * O, K,) this latter from Sb, (TA,) [but<br>\
it seems to be implied in the K that the verb<br>\
with ضِرَاحٌ for its inf. n. has its aor., as well as<br>\
this inf. n., like that of كَتَبَ, which I do not<br>\
think to be the case,] The beast kicked with its<br>\
hind leg: (S, O, K:) or الضَّرْحُ is with the fore<br>\
legs; and الرَّمْحُ, with the hind legs. (TA.) One<br>\
says, فِيهَا ضِرَاحٌ [It has a habit of kicking with<br>\
the hind leg: or, with the fore leg]; a phrase<br>\

ضَرَحَ, inf. n. ضَرْحٌ, also signifies [He clave the<br>\
ground; (see ضَرِيحٌ;) and] he split, slit, or rent<br>\
asunder or open, anything; like ضَرَجَ, with ج:<br>\
(TA:) but the phrase ضَرَحْنَا البُرُودَ, in a verse of<br>\
Dhur-r-Rummeh, as some relate it, is expl. by<br>\
AA as meaning We threw off the [garments called]<br>\
برود: others relate it with ج; and in this case<br>\
he says that it means “ we rent asunder ” or<br>\
“ open. ” (Az, O, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  ضَرَحَ [as though quasipass. of ضَرَحَهُ] signifies also He, or it, was, or<br>\

ضارحهُ and سابّهُ and راماهُ are [all] one [in signification, app. meaning He reviled him, or vilified<br>\

last seems to be here used tropically]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And i. q. قَارَبَهُ [He drew him near to him]; (O,<br>\
K;) namely, his companion. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, inf. n.<br>\
مُضَارَحَةٌ, He, or it, resembled, and corresponded<br>\
to, him, or it; syn. ضَارَعَهُ and قَابَلَهُ. (TA. [See<br>\
الضُّرَاحُ.])<br>\
4<br>\
اضرح i. q. أَبْعَدَ: (K:) you say, أَضْرِحْهُ عَنْكَ,<br>\
(so accord. to two copies of the S,) or ↓ اضْرَحْهُ,<br>\
(so in one of my copies of the S, [i. e. اِضْرَحْهُ,<br>\
from ضَرَحَهُ, in my other copy of the S اضْرحْهُ,<br>\
so that the correct form of the verb in this sense<br>\
is doubtful,]) meaning أَبْعِدْهُ [i. e. Remove thou,<br>\
or put far away, him, or it, from thee]. (S.)<br>\

-b2-  Also It split, slit, or<br>\
rent asunder or open: like انضرج. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اضطرحوا فُلَانًا They cast such a one aside:<br>\
(O, * L, TA: [see also 1, first sentence:]) the<br>\
vulgar say اِطَّرَحُوا, thinking it to be from الطَّرْحُ,<br>\
whereas it is from الضَّرْحُ: or, accord. to Az, it<br>\
may be that, in اطّرحوا, the ت of the measure<br>\
اِفْتَعَلَ is changed into ط, and ض incorporated<br>\
into it. (L, TA.)<br>\

like نَزَالِ, (TA,) meaning اِضْرَحْ, (K, TA,) i. e.<br>\
اُبْعُدْ: you say, ضَرَاحِ عَنْهُ Remove thou to a<br>\
distance, or go far away, from him, or it. (TA.)<br>\

المَعْمُورُ, (O, K, TA,) corresponding to, or over<br>\

side: (S:) or a grave (K, TA) altogether:<br>\

قَطَامِىٌّ: (A&#39;Obeyd, TA:) [it is mentioned in the<br>\
