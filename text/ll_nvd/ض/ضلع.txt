ضَلَعَ, aor.<br>\
ضَلَعَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. ضَلْعٌ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb,) It, or (assumed tropical:)  he, inclined, or declined:<br>\
(S, O, K:) it, or (assumed tropical:)  he, declined, or deviated, from<br>\
that which was right, or true: (S, O, Msb, K:)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  he acted wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or<br>\
tyrannically. (S, * O, * K.) You say, ضَلَعَ عَنْهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  He deviated, or turned away, from him, or it;<br>\
or he did so, acting wrongfully, &amp;c.: and ضَلَعَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  he acted wrongfully, &amp;c., against him.<br>\
(TA.) And ضَلْعُكَ مَعَ فُلَانٍ (S, O, Msb, * K *)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Thy inclining, (S, O, Msb, K,) and thy love, or<br>\
desire, (S, O,) is with such a one [i. e. in unison<br>\
with that of such a one]. (S, O, Msb, * K: * in<br>\
the Msb and K, مَعَهُ is put in the place of مَعَ<br>\
فُلَانٍ.) And لَا تَنْقُشِ الشَّوْكَةَ بِالشَّوْكَةِ فَإِنَّ ضَلْعَهَا<br>\
مَعَهَا, (S, O, K,) or بِمِثْلِهَا [in the place of<br>\
بالشوكة], (Meyd,) [lit. Extract not thou the thorn<br>\
by means of the thorn, or by means of the like of<br>\
it, for its inclination is with it,] meaning, demand<br>\
not aid, in the case of thy want, of him who is<br>\
more benevolent to the person from whom the<br>\
object of want is sought than he is to thee:<br>\
(Meyd:) a prov.: (S, Meyd, O:) applied to the<br>\
man who contends in an altercation with another,<br>\
and says, “Appoint thou between me and thee<br>\
such a one; ” pointing to a man who loves what<br>\
he [i. e. the opponent of the speaker] loves: (S,<br>\
O, K:) the author of the K adds, it is said that<br>\
it should by rule be ضَلَعَكَ, for they say ضَلِعَ مَعَ<br>\
فُلَانٍ, like فَرِحَ, [as though meaning he inclined<br>\
with such a one,] but they have contracted it;<br>\
which is wonderful, in consideration with his<br>\
having mentioned shortly before, ضَلَعَ, like مَنَعَ,<br>\
as signifying مَالَ. (TA.) One says also, خَاصَمْتُ<br>\
فُلَانًا فَكَانَ ضَلْعُكَ عَلَىَّ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [I contended in an<br>\
altercation with such a one and] thy inclining<br>\
[was against me]. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ضَلِعَ, aor.<br>\
ضَلَعَ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. ضَلَعٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) means<br>\
It (a sword, K, or a thing, Msb) was, or became,<br>\
crooked, or curved: (Mgh, Msb, K:) and<br>\
↓ تضلّع may mean the same: (Ham p. 80:) a<br>\
poet says, (namely, Mohammad Ibn-&#39;Abd-Allah<br>\
El-Azdee, TA,)<br>\
وَقَدْ يَحْمِلُ السَّيْفَ المُجَرَّبَ رَبُّهُ<br>\
عَلَى ضَلَعٍ فِى مَتْنِهِ وَهْوَ قَاطِعُ<br>\
[And verily, or sometimes, or often, its owner<br>\
bears the tried sword, notwithstanding crookedness<br>\
in its broad side, it being sharp]: (S, O:) and<br>\
(K) ضَلَعٌ signifies the being crooked, or curved,<br>\
by nature; (S, O, K;) as also ضَلْعٌ; whence the<br>\
saying, لَأُقِيمَنَّ ضَلَعَكَ and ضَلْعَكَ [I will<br>\
assuredly straighten thy natural crookedness]:<br>\
(K:) thus in the copies of the K; but this is a<br>\
mistake, occasioned by the author&#39;s seeing in the T<br>\
and M لَأُقِيمَنَّ ضَلَعَكَ and صَلَعَكَ meaning عَوَجَكَ,<br>\
and his imagining both these nouns to be with<br>\
ض and to differ in the manner stated above:<br>\
(TA:) you say, ضَلِعَ, aor.<br>\
ضَلَعَ, inf. n. ضَلَعٌ i. e.<br>\
he, or it, was, or became, crooked, or curved, by<br>\
nature: (S, O:) or ضَلَعٌ in the camel is like غَمْزٌ<br>\
in horses or the like, [meaning the limping, or<br>\
halting, or having a slight lameness, in the hind<br>\
leg,] and the verb is ضَلِعَ; and the epithet [or<br>\
part. n.] is ↓ ضَلِعٌ: (K:) or this is rather the<br>\
explanation of ضَلْعٌ, with ظ; (TA;) [or as Mtr<br>\
says,] ضَلْع as meaning what resembles عَرَجٌ [or<br>\
natural lameness] is correctly ظَلْع: (Mgh:)<br>\
but when it (i. e. the crookedness, TA) is not<br>\
natural, one says, ضَلَعَ, like مَنَعَ, (K, TA,) [but<br>\
this seems rather to relate to the meaning of<br>\
“ limping,” agreeably with what I have cited<br>\
above from the Mgh,] and the inf. n. is ضَلْعٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and the epithet [or part. n.] is ↓ ضَالِعٌ.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
-A2-  ضَلُعَ, [aor.<br>\
ضَلُعَ,] inf. n. ضَلَاعَةٌ, He (a man,<br>\
S, O, Msb, [and app. also a horse and the like,<br>\
see its part. n. ضَلِيعٌ,]) was, or became, strong,<br>\
or powerful; (S, O, Msb, K;) and strong, hard,<br>\
or firm, in the أَضْلَاع [or ribs]. (S, O, K. [The<br>\
latter is said in Har p. 6 to be the primary meaning;<br>\
and the former, metaphorical.])<br>\
-A3-  ضَلَعَ as syn.<br>\
with تَضَلَّعَ: see the latter.<br>\
-A4-  ضَلَعَ فُلَانًا He<br>\
struck such a one upon his ضِلَع [or rib]. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
ضَلَّعَ see 4, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  تَضْلِيعُ الأَعْمَالِ is<br>\
said by some to mean (assumed tropical:)  The making deeds to<br>\
deviate from the right, or direct, way or course:<br>\
and by some to mean (assumed tropical:)  the making them heavy,<br>\
or burdensome. (Har p. 77.) ―<br>\
-b3-  تَضْلِيعُ الثَّوْبِ<br>\
signifies The figuring the garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth, with the form of أَضْلَاع [or ribs]. (S, O, K.)<br>\
[See also the pass. part. n., below.]<br>\
4<br>\
اضلعهُ, (K,) inf. n. إِضْلَاعٌ, (S, O,) It, or<br>\
he, made it, or (assumed tropical:)  him, to incline, or decline; (S,<br>\
O, K;) [and so ↓ ضلّعهُ; for] الإِضْلَاعُ and<br>\
التَّضْلِيعُ signify الإِمَالَةُ. (Har p. 77.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And<br>\
It, or he, made it, or him, to be crooked, or<br>\
curved; and so ↓ ضلّعهُ; for] الإِضْلَاعُ and التَّضْلِيعُ<br>\
signify also التَّعْوِيجُ. (Har ubi suprà.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence,] one says also, أَضْلَعَتْهُ الخُطُوبُ, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Affairs, or great or grievous affairs,] burdened<br>\
him [as though making him to incline, or curving<br>\
him]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 8.<br>\
5<br>\
تضلّع: see 1, in the middle of the paragraph.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Also,] (S, O, K,) and ↓ ضَلَعَ, like مَنَعَ, (K,)<br>\
said of a man, (S, O,) He became filled, (S, O,<br>\
K,) or what was between his أَضْلَاع [or ribs]<br>\
became filled, (TA,) with food, (S, O, K,) or<br>\
drink: (S, O:) or with drink so that the water<br>\
reached his أَضْلَاع, (K, TA,) and they became<br>\
swollen out in consequence thereof: (TA in explanation of the former verb:) and the former<br>\
verb is also expl. as meaning he drank much, so<br>\
that his side and his ribs became stretched. (TA.)<br>\
And تضلّع مِنَ الطَّعَامِ He became filled with the<br>\
food; as though it filled his ribs. (Msb.)<br>\
8<br>\
الاِضْطِلَاعُ is from الضَّلَاعَةُ [inf. n. of ضَلُعَ]<br>\
meaning “ the being strong, or powerful; ” (ISk,<br>\
S, O, and Har p. 391;) الاِضْطِلَاعُ بِالشَّىْءِ signifying The raising the thing upon one&#39;s back, and<br>\
rising with it, and having strength, or power,<br>\
sufficient for it. (Har ibid.) And you say,<br>\
اضطلع بِحَمْلِهِ, meaning He had strength, or<br>\
power, to bear it, or carry it. (Mgh, and Har<br>\
p. 645.) [See also the part. n., below.] And<br>\
بِالأَمْرِ ↓ أَضْلَعَ (assumed tropical:)  He had strength, or power, sufficient for the affair; as though his ribs had<br>\
strength to bear it. (Msb.)<br>\
ضَلْعٌ: see ضِلَعٌ, first sentence.<br>\
ضِلْعٌ: see ضِلَعٌ, first and last sentences.<br>\
ضَلَعٌ The weight, or burden, of debt, that bends<br>\
the bearer thereof. (IAth, O, K.) And Strength,<br>\
or power; (As, S, O, Msb, K;) a subst. in this<br>\
sense, from ضَلُعَ; (Msb;) and the bearing, or<br>\
endurance of that which is heavy, or burdensome.<br>\
(As, S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also inf. n. of ضَلِعَ [q. v.].<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K.)<br>\
ضَلِعٌ Crooked, or curved, by nature. (S, O,<br>\
TA.) And applied to a spear as meaning<br>\
Crooked, or curved; not straightened: (TA:)<br>\
or, so applied, inclining, or bending: (Ham<br>\
p. 80:) and ↓ ضَلِيعٌ and ↓ ضَالِعٌ, so applied,<br>\
[likewise] mean crooked, or curved. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also 1, in the last quarter of the paragraph.<br>\
ضِلَعٌ and ↓ ضِلْعٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) the<br>\
former of the dial. of El-Hijáz and the latter of<br>\
the dial. of Temeem, (Msb, TA,) and ↓ ضَلْعٌ,<br>\

[A rib;] a certain appertenance of an animal,<br>\
(Msb,) well known; (K;) the curved thing of<br>\
the side; (TA;) a single bone of the bones of the<br>\
side: (Mgh, Msb:) of the fem. gender, (Msb,<br>\
K, TA,) accord. to common repute; or, as some<br>\
say, masc.; or, accord. to some, whose opinion<br>\
in this case is preferred by Ibn-Málik and others,<br>\
of both genders: (TA:) pl. [of mult.] ضُلُوعٌ<br>\
and [of pauc.] أَضْلَاعٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
أَضْلُعٌ, (O, Msb, K,) and أَضَالِعُ also is a pl. of<br>\
ضِلَعٌ, or, as some say, of [its pl.] أَضْلُعٌ. (TA.)<br>\
ضِلَعُ الخَلْفِ [and الخِلْفِ] is [The rib] in the<br>\
lowest part of the side [of a man, i. e. the lowest<br>\
rib; and the hindmost rib in a beast]: (TA:)<br>\
and signifies also A burn in the part behind what<br>\
is thus termed. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A piece<br>\
of stick or wood; syn. عُودٌ; [erroneously supposed by Golius and Freytag to mean here the<br>\
musical instrument thus called;] (IAar, O, K;)<br>\
so in a saying of the Prophet to a woman,<br>\
respecting a blood-stain on a garment, حُتِّيهِ بِضِلَعٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Scrape thou it off with a piece of stick]: (IAar,<br>\

TA;) as being likened to the ضِلَع [properly<br>\
thus called]. (O, TA.) ―<br>\

birds; because of its gibbous shape: so in the<br>\
saying, نَصَبَ ضِلَعًا لِلطَّيْرِ [He set up a trap for<br>\
the birds]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And The base, or lower<br>\
part, of a raceme of a palm-tree. (TA in art.<br>\
عهن.) ―<br>\

an evenness (تَقَوُّمٌ, as in the O and K, or تَقْوِيمٌ,<br>\
as in the L), [app. towards each extremity,] the<br>\
rest of it (سَائِرُهَا) being similar to its كَبِد [which<br>\
means its middle part, or part where it is grasped<br>\
with the hand, or part against which the arrow<br>\
goes, &amp;c., for it is variously explained]; (O, K,<br>\
TA;) so accord. to As, (O, TA,) and AHn;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ ضَلِيعٌ, (O, K, TA,) and ↓ ضَلِيعَةٌ;<br>\
for which last, مَضْلُوعَةٌ is erroneously repeated<br>\
in the K; [app. from its author finding it said<br>\
in the O that such a bow is termed ضَلِيعٌ and<br>\
مَضْلُوعَةٌ; and in the TK, مُضَوْلَعَةٌ is substituted<br>\
for it:] ↓ قَوْسٌ ضَلِيعَةٌ is also expl. as meaning a<br>\
thick bow. (TA.)<br>\
مُضْطَلِعٌ is from الضَّلَاعَةُ [inf. n. of ضَلُعَ]: so in<br>\
the saying, فُلَانٌ مُضْطَلِعٌ بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ i. e. Such a<br>\
one is possessed of strength, or power, sufficient for<br>\
this affair: so says ISk: and he adds that one<br>\
should not say مُطَّلِعٌ: Aboo-Nasr Ahmad Ibn-<br>\
Hátim says, one says هُوَ مُضْطَلِعٌ بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ and<br>\
مُطَّلِعٌ له [also]; الاِضْطِلَاعُ being from الضَّلَاعَةُ<br>\
meaning القُوَّةُ; and الاِطِّلَاعُ being from العُلُوُّ,<br>\
from the saying اِطَّلَعْتُ الثَّنِيَّةَ meaning عَلَوْتُهَا [I<br>\
ascended upon the mountain, or mountain-road,<br>\
termed ثَنِيَّة]; i. e. he is one who has ascendancy<br>\
with respect to this affair, who is master of it:<br>\
(S, O, TA:) Lth expressly allows مُطَّلِعٌ for<br>\
مُضْطَلِعٌ by the incorporation of the ض into the<br>\
[letter that is originally] ت, so that the two<br>\
together become ط with teshdeed. (TA.) And<br>\
لِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ ↓ هُوَ مُضْلِعٌ means the same as مُضْطَلِعٌ<br>\
as first expl. above, i. e. He is possessed of<br>\
strength, or power, sufficient for this affair. (O,<br>\
K. [In both, in this instance, لِهٰذَا, not بِهٰذَا.])<br>\
In the phrase إِذَا كَانَ مُضْطَلِعًا عَلَى حَقِّهِ [If he<br>\
be possessed of power, or ability, to obtain his<br>\
right, or due], it seems that مضطلعا is made<br>\
trans. by means of على because made to imply<br>\
the meaning of قَادِرًا or مُقْتَدِرًا. (Mgh.) ↓ مُسْتَضْلِعٌ,<br>\
likewise, signifies Having strength, or power.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُسْتَضْلِعٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
