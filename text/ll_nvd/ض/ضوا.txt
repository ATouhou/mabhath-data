ضَوَّاَ see the next paragraph, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
One says also, ضَوَّأْتُ عَنْهُ [meaning I brought to<br>\
light, made visible, discovered, or revealed, him,<br>\
or it]. (M, TA.) A sheep, or goat, belonging<br>\
to an Arab of the desert strayed; whereupon he<br>\
said, اَللّٰهُمَّ ضَوِّئْ عَنْهُ [O God, bring it to light, or<br>\
discover it]. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Accord. to Lth, but<br>\
he is the only authority for it known by AM,<br>\
(TA,) ضَوَّأَ عَنِ الأَمْرِ, inf. n. تَضْوِئَةٌ, means He<br>\
declined, or turned away, from the affair. (K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اضآء, (M, Msb, K,) said of a thing, (M,)<br>\
[as, for instance,] of the moon, (Msb,) or اضآءت,<br>\
said of fire (النَّار,), (A &#39;Obeyd, S, O,) inf. n. إِضَآءٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) and ↓ ضَآءَ, (M, Msb, K,) or ضَآءَت, (S, O,)<br>\
aor. يَضُوْءُ, (M,) or تَضُوْءُ, (S,) inf. n. ضَوْءٌ (S, M,<br>\
O, Msb, K) and ضُوْءٌ, (S, O, K,) or the latter is a<br>\
simple subst.; (Msb;) but the former verb is<br>\
preferred; (TA;) It gave light, was light or<br>\
bright, shone, or shone brightly. (Msb, K, * TA.)<br>\
[See also an ex. of ↓ the latter verb in a verse<br>\
cited voce أُفُقٌ; and cited here in the TA.] And<br>\
أَضَأْتُ لَهُ [I gave light to him]. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  The<br>\
former verb is also trans.: you say, أَضَآءَتْهُ النَّارُ<br>\
[The fire made it to be light or bright, to shine, or<br>\
to shine brightly]: (S, O:) and أَضَأْتُهُ and ↓ ضَوَّأْتُهُ<br>\
[I made it to give light, to be light or bright, to<br>\
shine, or to shine brightly]: (M, Msb, * K:) and<br>\
أَضَأْتُ بِهِ البَيْتَ and بِهِ ↓ ضَوَّأْتُهُ [I lighted, or<br>\
illumined, with it (i. e. with a lamp or the like)<br>\
the house, or chamber, or tent]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
اضآء بِبَوْلِهِ (tropical:)  He ejected his urine [so as to make its<br>\
drops to glisten]; or emitted it and then stopped<br>\
it; syn. حَذَفَ بِهِ; (K, TA;) or خَذَفَ بِهِ;<br>\
(so in a copy of the M, as on the authority of<br>\
Kr;) or, as in the A, أَذْرَعَ بِهِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
they said مَا أَضْوَأَهُ [How light, or bright, is it!].<br>\
(S voce أَظْلَمَ [q. v.].) ―<br>\
-b4-  And اضآء signifies also<br>\
أَصَابَ ضَوْءًا [He saw (lit. lighted on, or found,)<br>\
light, or brightness]. (T voce أَظْلَمَ [q. v.])<br>\
5<br>\
تضوّأ He stood in the dark to see people by<br>\
the light of their fire, (AZ, K, TA,) without their<br>\
seeing him. (AZ, TA.) And تضوّا امْرَأَةً [He<br>\
stood in the dark to see a woman by the light of<br>\
her fire, without her seeing him]. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
اِسْتَضَأُتُ بِهِ [I sought to obtain light by<br>\
means of it; I made use of it for light]. (M, K.)<br>\
لَا تَسْتَضِيؤُوا بِنَارِ أَهْلِ الشِّرْكِ [lit. Seek not ye to<br>\
obtain light by means of the fire of the people of<br>\
belief in a plurality of gods], (O, K,) a saying of<br>\
the Prophet, (O,) means (tropical:)  seek not ye counsel, or<br>\
advice, of the believers in a plurality of gods, in<br>\
affairs: (O, K:) because he whose affair is confused and dubious to him is as though he were in<br>\
darkness. (O.)<br>\
ضَوْءٌ and ↓ ضُوْءٌ and ↓ ضِيَآءٌ (S, M, O, K) and<br>\
↓ ضِوَآءٌ, (M, K,) the last of which is [erroneously]<br>\
written in the L ضَوَآءٌ, (TA,) signify the same,<br>\
(S, M, O, K,) i. e. Light, syn. نُورٌ, (K, TA,)<br>\
accord. to the leading lexicologists; but see what<br>\
follows: (TA:) and ضَوْءٌ is an inf. n. of ضَآءَ, (S,<br>\
M, O, Msb, K,) and so is ↓ ضُوْءٌ, (S, O, K,) or<br>\
this is a simple subst. from ضَآءَ, and so is ↓ ضِيَآءٌ,<br>\
which is also, sometimes, written ↓ ضِئَآءٌ, from أَضَآءَ<br>\
as syn. with ضَآءَ: (Msb:) the pl. of ضَوْءٌ (M,<br>\
TA) and ↓ ضُوْءٌ (M) is أَضْوَآءٌ; and ↓ ضِيَآءٌ is sometimes a pl., (M, TA,) as Zj states it to be: (TA:)<br>\
some say that ضَوْءٌ has a more intensive signification than نُورٌ, and that hence God has likened<br>\
his direction [the Kur-án] to النُّور rather than to<br>\
الضَّوْء; because if it were otherwise, no one had<br>\
erred: and that hence, also, [in the Kur x. 5,]<br>\
the sun is termed ↓ ضِيَآء; and the moon, نُورٌ: it<br>\
is also said that ضَوْءٌ signifies the rays that are<br>\
diffused by what is termed نُورٌ: the kádee Zekereeyà affirms that these two words are syn. by<br>\
their original application, but that ضَوْءٌ is more<br>\
forcible accord. to usage: and some say that<br>\
الضَّوْءُ signifies that [light] which subsists by itself,<br>\
as [that of] the sun, and fire; and النُّورُ, to that<br>\
which subsists by some other thing [as does the<br>\
light of the moon]. (MF, TA.)<br>\
