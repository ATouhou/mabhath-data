ضَلَلْتُ, (S, Mgh, * O, Msb, * K,) third pers.<br>\
ضَلَّ, (Mgh, Msb,) aor.<br>\
ضَلِ3َ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. ضَلَالٌ and ضَلَالَةٌ; (S, * O, * Msb;) and<br>\
ضَلِلْتُ, (S, Mgh, * O, Msb, * K,) third pers. as<br>\
above; (Mgh;) the former of the dial. of Nejd,<br>\
and the more chaste; the latter of the dial. of the<br>\
people of El-&#39;Áliyeh, (S, Msb, TA,) and of El-<br>\
Hijáz, and Kr has mentioned ضِلِلْتُ for ضَلِلْتُ as<br>\
heard from the tribe of Temeem; (TA;) I erred,<br>\
strayed, or went astray; (Mgh, Msb;) deviated<br>\
from the right way or course, or from that which<br>\
was right; missed, or lost, the right way; or lost<br>\
my way; ضَلَالٌ and ضَلَالَةٌ signifying the contr.<br>\
of رَشَادٌ, (S, O, TA,) and هُدًى. (K, TA.) [See<br>\
ضَلَالٌ below.] Hence, in the Kur [xxxiv. 49],<br>\
قُلْ إِنْ ضَلَلْتُ فِإِنَّمَا أَضِلُّ عَلَى نَفْسِى [Say thou, If<br>\
I err, I shall err only against myself, i. e., to my<br>\
own hurt]. (O, Msb. [See also x. 108 and xvii.<br>\
16 of the Kur.]) One says also, ضَلَّ ضَلَالُهُ [app.<br>\
His error became error indeed; a phrase similar<br>\
to جَدَّ جِدُّهُ, q. v.: or his erring passed away;<br>\
see 4, latter part]. (TA.) And ضَلَّ عَنِ القَصْدِ<br>\
He deviated from the right way or course. (TA.)<br>\
And the verb is trans. as well as intrans.: you<br>\
say, ضَلَّ الطَّرِيقَ, and ضَلَّ عَنْهُ, aor.<br>\
ضَلِ3َ and<br>\
ضَلَ3َ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) inf. ns. as above, meaning He erred,<br>\
strayed, or went astray, from the road, or way;<br>\
(Msb;) he did not find the way to the road:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) and of anything stationary, if you<br>\
miss the place thereof, you say ضَلَلْتُهُ and ضَلِلْتُهُ:<br>\
(Az, Msb:) or you say, ضَلِلْتُ الطَّرِيقَ, (K,) or<br>\
ضَلِلْتُ المَسْجِدَ, and الدَّارَ, (ISk, S, O,) [I missed,<br>\
or lost, the right way to the road, or the mosque,<br>\
and the house,] when you know not the place<br>\
thereof: (ISk, S, O:) and in like manner, anything stationary, to which one does not find the<br>\
way: (ISk, S, O, K:) and AA says the like:<br>\
but that one says of a thing that falls from his<br>\
hand, and a thing that quits its place, ↓ أَضْلَلْتُهُ,<br>\
(IB, TA,) which means I lost it, and knew not<br>\
its place; meaning, for instance, a horse, or she-camel, or the like: (Az, Msb:) [thus] one says,<br>\
أَضْلَلْتُ بِعِيرِى [I lost my camel, and knew not<br>\
his place,] (AA, ISk, S, IB, O) when his shank<br>\
has been tied up to his arm and one does not find<br>\
the way to him, and when he has been left loose<br>\
and has gone away whither one knows not: (AA,<br>\
IB, TA:) but Yoo differs from others respecting<br>\
this case; for, accord. to him, one says, اضلّ<br>\
فُلَانٌ بَعِيرَهُ and also ضَلَّهُ, in the same sense; (O,<br>\
TA;) and the like is said in the K: (TA:) and<br>\
it is also said in the Bári&#39; that when you seek an<br>\
animal and miss its place and find not the way to<br>\
it, it is regarded as in the category of stationary<br>\
things, and therefore you say ضَلِلْتُهُ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
ضَلَّ signifies also He was, or became, confounded,<br>\
or perplexed, and unable to see his right course.<br>\
(Ibn-Es-Seed, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, aor.<br>\
ضَلِ3َ (S, O, K) and<br>\
ضَلَ3َ, (K,) the pret. being like زَلَّ and مَلَّ, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. ضَلَال, It (a thing, S, O, TA) became lost;<br>\
[as though it went astray;] it perished, came to<br>\
nought, or passed away. (S, O, K, TA.) Thus in<br>\
the phrase ضَلَّ عَنِّى كَذَا Such a thing became<br>\
lost from me. (Mgh.) One says to him from whom<br>\
pieces of money have dropped, قَدْ ضَلَّتْ عَنْكَ<br>\
[They have become lost from thee]. (TA.) And to<br>\
him who has done a deed from which no profit<br>\
has resulted, you say, قَد ضَلَّ سَعْيُكَ (tropical:)  [Thy labour<br>\
has been lost]: the like occurs in the Kur xviii. 104,<br>\
meaning ضَاعَ. (TA, in two places.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  He<br>\
(a man, TA) died, and became dust and bones.<br>\
(K, TA.) In this sense the verb is used in the<br>\
Kur xxxii. 9: but some there read, in the place<br>\
of ضَلَلْنَا, صَلِلْنَا [q. v.], with ص: (TA:) or the<br>\
verb in that instance has the meaning here next<br>\
following. (S.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, (a man, S,<br>\
TA, or a camel, Msb, and a thing, TA,) was, or<br>\
became, unperceived or imperceptible, unapparent,<br>\
latent, hidden or concealed, or absent, (S, Msb,<br>\
K, TA.) Hence the phrase, ضَلَّ المَآءُ فِى اللَّبَنِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [The water became unperceived, or concealed, in<br>\
the milk]. (TA.) One says of a road to which<br>\
he has not been able to find the way, ضَلَّ عَنِّى<br>\
[It has become hidden from me]. (K, TA.) And<br>\
hence also the saying of a man, as is related in a<br>\
trad., (S, O, TA,) after his having charged his<br>\
sons by saying to them, “When I die, burn ye<br>\
me; and when I shall have become ashes, pound<br>\
me; then scatter me in the water: ” (O, TA:)<br>\
لَعَلِّى أَضِلُّ اللّٰه (S, O, TA) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  May-be, I shall<br>\
be unperceived by God, or concealed from Him:<br>\
(S:) or may-be, I shall be hidden, or absent, from<br>\
God&#39;s punishment: (O, TA:) or, as El-&#39;Otbee<br>\
says, may-be, I shall escape God, and my place<br>\
will be hidden from Him. (TA.) And ضَلَّ said<br>\
of one forgetting means (assumed tropical:)  His memory became<br>\
absent from him. (O, Msb, TA.) أَنْ تَضِلَّ إِحْدَاهُمَا,<br>\
or إِنْ تَضِلَّ, in the Kur [ii. 282], accord. to different readers, (TA,) in which instance أَنْ and إِنْ<br>\
are syn., (Mughnee, [see أَنْ, in p. 106, cols. 1<br>\
and 2,]) means If one of them twain [referring to<br>\
women] be absent from her memory: or if the<br>\
memory of one of them twain be absent from her:<br>\
[or if one of them twain err in her memory:] or,<br>\
accord. to Zj, the meaning of the verb in this case<br>\
is that which next follows. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  ضَلِلْتُ<br>\
الشَّىْءَ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  I forgot the thing: whence<br>\
one says of a woman, ضَلَّتْ أَيَّامَ حَيْضِهَا (assumed tropical:)  [She<br>\
forgot the days of her menstruation]; and so<br>\
↓ أَضَلَّتْهَا: (Mgh:) or ضَلَّ فُلَانًا (assumed tropical:)  He was made,<br>\
or caused, to forget such a one. (K. [In the CK,<br>\
اُنْسِيْهِ is erroneously put for أُنْسِيَهُ.]) It is said<br>\
that لَا يَضِلُّ رَبِّى, in the Kur xx. 54, means (assumed tropical:)  My<br>\
Lord will not be unmindful: or nothing will escape<br>\
Him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And one says, ضَلَّنِى فُلَانٌ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) or ضَلَّنِى فُلَانٌ فَلَمْ أَقْدَرْ عَلَيْهِ, (O,) meaning<br>\
Such a one went away from me, (O, Msb, K,)<br>\
and I was unable to compass him [or to find him]:<br>\
so in the Bári&#39;. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  ضُلَّ, as a verb of<br>\
wonder: see ضُلٌّ.<br>\
2<br>\
ضلَلهُ, (S, MA, O, K,) inf. n. تَضْلِيلٌ and<br>\
تَضْلَالٌ, (K,) He, or it, made, or caused, him to<br>\
pursue a course that led to error, or deviation<br>\
from the right way: (K: [see also 4:]) he,<br>\
or it, led him astray; seduced him: (MA:)<br>\
[or] he attributed, or imputed, to him error,<br>\
or deviation from the right way. (S, MA,<br>\
O.) ضُلِّلَ سَعْيُهُمْ, a phrase used by a poet, means<br>\
Error, or deviation from the right way, was attributed to their labour; because they did not<br>\
reach their goal. (Ham p. 771.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one<br>\
says, ضَلِّلْ مَالَكَ Send forth, or set free, thy cattle<br>\
to pasture, or to pasture where they please, by<br>\
themselves. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also the next paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
اضلّهُ, inf. n. إِضْلَالٌ, He, or it, made him,<br>\
or caused him, to err, stray, or go astray; to<br>\
deviate from the right way or course, or from that<br>\
which was right; to miss, or lose, the right way;<br>\
or to lose his way. (Az, TA.) [See also 2, first<br>\
sentence.] الإِضْلَالُ is of two sorts: one of these<br>\
is the consequence of erring, or straying; either<br>\
as in the case in which one says أَضْلَلْتُ البَعِيرَ<br>\
(expl. above, see 1, former half); or the decreeing<br>\
that one shall err, or stray, &amp;c., because he has<br>\
done so already, and this is sometimes the case<br>\
when the إِضْلَال of a man is attributed to God:<br>\
the other sort is the embellishing [or commending]<br>\
to a man that which is false, or wrong, or vain, in<br>\
order that he may err, or stray, &amp;c.: and God&#39;s<br>\
إِضْلَال of a man is of two sorts; one of which has<br>\
been expl. above; the other is God&#39;s so constituting man that when he observes [and pursues] a<br>\
certain course, or way, [of acting or the like],<br>\
whether it be such as is commended or such as is<br>\
discommended, he habituates himself to it, and<br>\
esteems it pleasant, and keeps to it, and finds it<br>\
difficult to turn from it, wherefore it is said that<br>\
custom is a second nature. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also He, or it, made, or caused, him, or it, to<br>\
perish, or become lost; syn. أَهْلَكَهُ, (S, TA,) and<br>\
أَضَاعَهُ, (El-Fárábee, S, O, Msb,) or ضَيَّعَهُ; (TA;)<br>\
[اضاعهُ and ضيّعهُ signifying the same; and so<br>\
اضلّهُ and ↓ ضللّٰهُ; whence,] أَلَمْ يَجْعَلْ كَيْدَهُمْ<br>\
فِى تَضْلِيلٍ, in the Kur cv. 2, means [Did He not<br>\
make their plot to be such as ended] in a causing<br>\
to perish, or become lost, (فِى تَضْيِيعٍ,) and in annulment? (Ksh, Bd.) أَضَلَّ أَعْمَالَهُمْ, in the Kur<br>\
[xlvii. 1 and 9, which may be rendered (assumed tropical:)  He will<br>\
cause their works to be lost, or to be of no effect],<br>\
means, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, He will not recompense them for their good works; the phrase being<br>\
similar to the saying قَدْ ضَلَّ سَعْيُكَ [expl. above].<br>\
(TA.) And أَضَلَّ اللّٰهُ ضَلَالَكَ (assumed tropical:)  [May God make<br>\
thine erring to be no more, or to come to an end,]<br>\
is expl. by ISk as meaning may thine erring pass<br>\
away from thee, so that thou shalt not err; and<br>\
he adds that the saying مَلَّ مَلَالُكَ means ذَهَبَ<br>\
عَنْكَ حَتَّى لَا تَمَلَّ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  He buried,<br>\
and hid, or concealed, him, or it. (K, TA.) You<br>\
say, أُضِلَّ المَيِّتُ (tropical:)  The dead was buried. (S, O.)<br>\
The phrase أَضَلَّتْ بِهِ أُمُّهُ, meaning (tropical:)  His mother<br>\
buried him, in a verse cited by IAar, is extr.,<br>\
or anomalous. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And He found him<br>\
to be erring, straying, going astray; deviating<br>\
from the right way or course, or from that which<br>\
was right; missing, or losing, the right way;<br>\
losing his way; not rightly directed, or not finding<br>\
the way to the truth: like as one says أَحْمَدَهُ, and<br>\
أَبْخَلَهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And you say, أَضَلَّنِى كَذَا,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a thing was, or became, beyond<br>\
my power, or compass. (IAar, Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
See also 1, near the end.<br>\
5<br>\
تظلّل It went away: so in the saying,<br>\
تضلّل المَآءُ مِنْ تَحْتِ الحَجَرِ [The water went<br>\
away from beneath the stone]. (O, TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تضالّ He feigned himself to be erring, straying, going astray; deviating from the right way<br>\
or course, or from that which was right; missing,<br>\
or losing, the right way; or losing his way.<br>\
(O, TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استضلّ ضَلَالُهُ His erring demanded that<br>\
he should err [the more], so that he did err<br>\
[the more: like as erring is said to be a cause<br>\
of one&#39;s being made to err: see 4: and see also<br>\
ضَلَّ ضَلَالُهُ, near the beginning of the art.]: so<br>\
in the saying of Aboo-Dhu-eyb,<br>\
رَآهَا الفُؤَادُ فَاسْتَضَلَّ ضَلَالُهُ<br>\
[The heart beheld her, and his erring demanded<br>\
that he should err &amp;c.]. (Skr, S, TA.)<br>\
ضَلٌّ: see ضَلَالٌ.<br>\
ضُلٌّ: see ضَلَالٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also, app. as meaning<br>\
A lost state; a state of perishing, coming to nought,<br>\
or passing away;] a subst. from ضَلَّ signifying<br>\
ضَاعَ and هَلَكَ. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence [its usage,<br>\
in the manner of a proper name, in] the saying,<br>\
هُوَ ضُلُّ بْنُ ضُلٍّ, (S,) which means, (S, O, K,) as<br>\
also ↓ هُوَ ضِلُّ بْنُ ضِلٍّ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K,) He<br>\
is the unknown, the son of the unknown; (S, Z, O,<br>\
K;) and in like manner, بْنُ التَّلَالِ ↓ الضَّلَالُ; (S,<br>\
O;) and قُلُّ بْنُ قُلٍّ: (TA:) or he is one in whom is<br>\
no good: (K:) or he is one who persists in error.<br>\
(M, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence also, perhaps, it is said that]<br>\
يَا ضُلَّ مَا تَجْرِى بِهِ العَصَا [in the CK ضَلَّ] means<br>\
يَا فَقْدَهُ and يَا تَلَفَهُ [i. e., app., O the loss, or O<br>\
the coming to nought, of that by reason of which<br>\
the mare El-&#39;Asà is running!]: (K, TA:) a<br>\
prov.; said by Kaseer Ibn-Saad to Jedheemeh<br>\
El-Abrash, when he went with him to Ez-Zebbà;<br>\
for when they were within her province, he repented, and Kaseer said to him, “Mount this my<br>\
horse, and escape upon him, for his dust will not<br>\
be cloven [by the pursuer,” i. e. he will not be<br>\
overtaken]: (TA: [but the mare is thus made a<br>\
male:]) or it was said by &#39;Amr Ibn-&#39;Adee, when<br>\
he saw El-&#39;Asà, the mare of Jedheemeh, with<br>\
Kaseer upon her: قَوْمُ is suppressed after يا; and<br>\
↓ ضُلَّ is of the forms [of verbs] denoting wonder,<br>\
originally ضَلُلَ, with damm, like حُبَّ in the<br>\
phrase حُبَّ بِفُلَانٍ, originally حَبُبَ; and the<br>\
meaning of the prov. is, O people, what a case of<br>\
perdition is that by reason of which El-&#39;Asà is<br>\
running! i. e., the death of Jedheemeh. (Meyd.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  ضُلٌّ بِتَضْلَالٍ [in CK ضَلٌّ] means A vain, or<br>\
futile, thing: (S, O, K:) [or a vain, misleading<br>\
thing; تَضْلَالٌ being an inf. n. of ضَلَّلَ:] &#39;Amr<br>\
Ibn-Shás El-Asadee says,<br>\
تَذَكَّرْتُ لَيْلَى لَاتَ حِينَ ادِكَارِهَا<br>\
وَقَدْ حُنِىَ الأَضْلَاعُ ضُلٌّ بِتَضْلَالِ<br>\
[I remembered Leylà when it was not a time for<br>\
remembering her, the ribs having become bent by<br>\
the bending of the back with age: it was a vain,<br>\
misleading thing]. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b6-  ضُلُّ أَضْلَالٍ: see<br>\
ضِلَّةٌ.<br>\
هُوَ ضِلُّ بْنُ ضِلٍّ: see ضُلٌّ. ―<br>\
-b2-  ضِلُّ أَضْلَالٍ: see<br>\
ضِلَّةٌ.<br>\
ضَلَّةٌ Confusion, or perplexity, and inability to<br>\
see the right course: (K:) [or error: for] one<br>\
says, فَعَلَ ذٰلِكَ ضَلَّةً He did that in error (فِى<br>\
ضَلَالَةٍ): and ذَهَبَ ضَلَّةً He went away not knowing whither he went: (TA:) and فُلَانٌ يَلُومُنِى ضَلَّةً<br>\
Such a one blames me wrongly: (S, O:) [or, behind<br>\
my back, or in my absence: for] ضَلَّةٌ signifies<br>\
also speech respecting a person behind his back, or<br>\
in his absence; relating to good and to evil. (M,<br>\
K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [Freytag explains it as signifying also<br>\
One in whom is no good, on the authority of Meyd.]<br>\
ضُلَّةٌ Skill in guiding, or directing aright, in<br>\
journeying. (Fr, K, * TA.)<br>\
ضِلَّةٌ: see ضَلَالٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] هُوَ ابْنُهُ لِضِلَّةٍ<br>\
(tropical:)  He is his son unlawfully begotten, or not trueborn. (AZ, A, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ذَهَبَ دَمُهُ ضِلَّةً (tropical:)  His<br>\
blood went unrevenged, or without retaliation. (K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And هُوَ تِبْعُ ضِلَّةٍ, (Th, O, K, TA,) with<br>\
kesr to the ت and to the ض, (TA,) [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, تَبَعُ,] and تِبْعٌ ضِلَّةٌ, (K, TA,) thus<br>\
related by IAar, (TA,) but the former only accord.<br>\
to Th, (TA in art. تبع,) (assumed tropical:)  He is a follower of<br>\
women: (TA in that art.:) or he is one in whom<br>\
is no good, and with whom is no good: (IAar,<br>\
Th, TA:) or he is a very cunning man (دَاهِيَةٌ),<br>\
one in whom is no good; (IAar, O, K, TA;) and<br>\
so تِبْعُ صِلَّةٍ, (O, L, TA,) as some relate it; (L,<br>\
TA;) and in like manner, أَضْلَالٍ ↓ ضِلُّ, (Lh, O,<br>\
K, TA,) and أَضْلَالٍ ↓ ضُلُّ, (K, TA,) and صِلُّ<br>\
أَصْلَالٍ, [q. v.,] which is with kesr only, (K, TA,)<br>\
a phrase similar to ضِرُّ أَضْرَارٍ. (TA in art. ضر.)<br>\
ضَلَلٌ: see ضَلَالٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Water (O, K) running (K) beneath a rock, which the sun does not<br>\
reach: (O, K:) one says مَآءٌ ضَلَلٌ: (O:) or<br>\
running among trees. (K.) [See also ضَلَلٌ.]<br>\
ضَلَالٌ [an inf. n. of 1: used as a simple subst.,]<br>\
Error; contr. of رَشَادٌ, (S, O, TA,) and of هُدًى;<br>\
(K, TA;) as also ↓ ضَلَالَةٌ, (S, O, K,) and ↓ ضَلٌّ,<br>\
and ↓ ضُلٌّ, and ↓ ضِلَّةٌ, and ↓ ضَلَلٌ, and ↓ ضَلْضَلَةٌ,<br>\
(K,) and ↓ ضُلَضِلَةٌ, (O, TA,) and ↓ أُضْلُولَةٌ, (K,)<br>\
of which last the pl. is أَضَالِيلُ, (Lth, O, TA,) as<br>\
in the saying تَمَادَى فِى أَضَالِيلِ الهَوَى [He persevered in the errors of love], (TA,) or أَضَالِيلُ, as<br>\
some say, has no sing., or its sing. is supposed,<br>\
or has been heard, and is أُضْلُولَةٌ or أُضْلُولٌ or<br>\
إِضْلِيلٌ or some other form: (MF, TA:) the<br>\
primary signification of الضَّلَالُ is the going away<br>\
from the right course, or direction: (Ham<br>\
p. 357:) or it signifies, accord. to Ibn-El-Kemál,<br>\
the loss, or missing, of that which brings, or conducts, to the object sought: or, as some say, the<br>\
pursuing a way that will not bring, or conduct,<br>\
to that object: or, accord. to Er-Rághib, the<br>\
deviating from the right way: and it is said to<br>\
be any deviation from that which is right, intentional or unintentional, little or much; because<br>\
the right and approved way is very difficult;<br>\
wherefore it may be used of him who commits<br>\
any mistake whatever, and is imputed to prophets<br>\
and to unbelievers, though between the ضلال of<br>\
the former and that of the latter is a wide difference: and in another point of view, it is of two<br>\
sorts; one is in the speculative departments of<br>\
knowledge, as in acquaintance with the unity of<br>\
God, and with the prophetic function or office,<br>\
and the like, indicated in the Kur iv. 135; or it<br>\
is in the practical departments of knowledge, as<br>\
in acquaintance with the ordinances of the law,<br>\
that is, religious services. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A state<br>\
of perdition: so in the Kur liv. 24: (S, O:)<br>\
[and in like manner ↓ ضَلَالَةٌ; for] ضَلَالَةُ العَمَلِ<br>\
signifies The annulled and lost state of work.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Absence, or a state of concealment.<br>\
(Msb. [This is there said to be the primary signification.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  هُوَ الضَّلَالُ بْنُ التَّلَالِ see expl.<br>\
voce ضُلٌّ.<br>\
ضَلُولٌ: see ضَالٌّ.<br>\
ضَلَالَةٌ: see ضَلَالٌ, in the beginning, and near<br>\
the end, of the paragraph. One says, هِىَ الضَّلَالَةُ<br>\
وَالتَّلَالَةُ; (S, O;) in which the latter noun is an<br>\
imitative sequent. (S and K in art. تل.)<br>\
ضِلِّيلٌ A man (S, O) who errs, strays, goes<br>\
astray, or deviates from the right way or course,<br>\
much, or often: (S, O, K:) or (tropical:)  who errs, &amp;c.,<br>\
much, or often, in religion: (TA:) and ↓ مُضَلَّلٌ,<br>\
(S, TA,) which in some of the copies of the S is<br>\
written thus and also مُضَلِّل, (TA,) signifies the<br>\
same; (S, TA;) or one who is not disposed, or<br>\
directed, to good; in the K, الّذى لا يُوَفِّى بِخَيْرٍ,<br>\
[or يُوفِى بخير, as in the CK,] but correctly الّذى<br>\
لا يُوَفَّقُ لِخَيْرٍ; or, as some say, a committer of<br>\
errors, and of false, wrong, or vain, actions: and<br>\
ضِلِّيلٌ is also expl. as signifying one who will not<br>\
