ضَحِكَ, (S, MA, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) and some<br>\
say ضِحِكْتُ, with kesr to the ض, (TA, as from<br>\
the K, [but not in the CK nor in my MS. copy<br>\
of the K,]) to agree with the vowel of the ح<br>\
because the latter is a faucial letter, and this is<br>\
a correct dial. var. of which similar instances<br>\
are mentioned, and ضَحَكَ also is said to be a<br>\
well known dial. var. of ضَحِكَ, (TA,) aor.<br>\
ضَحَكَ,<br>\
(S. O,) inf. n. ضَحِكٌ and ضِحْكٌ (S, MA, O, Msb,<br>\
K, KL) and ضَحْكٌ, (S, MA, O, K, KL,) the first<br>\
of which is the superior form, (IDrd, O,) [the<br>\
second and third being contractions thereof,] and<br>\
ضِحِكٌ, (S, O, K, KL,) and if you said ضَحَكٌ it<br>\
would be agreeable with analogy, (Az, TA,) He<br>\
laughed; (MA, KL, PS, TK;) contr. of بَكَى:<br>\
(TK:) [see also 6:] الضَّحِكُ is well known, as<br>\
meaning the expanding of the face, and displaying<br>\
of the teeth, by reason of happiness, joy, or<br>\
gladness; and التَّبَسُّمُ is the beginning thereof: thus<br>\
in the Towsheeh and other works: (MF, TA:)<br>\
and in like manner in the Mufradát [of Er-Rághib]; in which it is added that it is also<br>\
used as meaning simply the being happy, joyful,<br>\
or glad: and sometimes as meaning simply the<br>\
wondering [at a thing]; and this is the meaning<br>\
intended by him who says that it is peculiar to<br>\
man: (TA:) [i. e.] ضَحِكَ, said of a man, signifies also he wondered; syn. عَجِبَ; (O, K, TA;)<br>\
with مِنْ preposed to the object of wonder: (TA:) or<br>\
he was frightened; or he feared. (K, TA.) You say,<br>\
ضَحِكَ مِنْهُ and بِهِ, both meaning the same, (S,<br>\
O, Msb,) i. e. He laughed at him; derided him;<br>\
or ridiculed him: or he wondered at him. (Msb.)<br>\
And ضَحِكَ إِلَيْهِ [He behaved laughingly, or<br>\
cheerfully, towards him]. (IDrd and K in art.<br>\
بش [See بَشَّ لَهُ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Said of an ape, He<br>\
uttered a cry or cries: (K:) or one says of<br>\
the ape when he utters a cry or cries, يَضْحَكُ,<br>\
(S, TA,) meaning he displays his teeth, or grins.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And ضَحِكَ السَّحَابُ (tropical:)  The clouds lightened. (S, O, K, TA.) Hence the usage of the<br>\
verb in a trad. cited voce تَحَدَّثَ. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And ضَحِكَ الغَدِيرُ i. e. (tropical:)  [The pool of water left<br>\
by a torrent] glistened by reason of its fulness.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [And ضَحِكَ ثَغْرُهُ (assumed tropical:)  His front teeth,<br>\
or his teeth, glistened by reason of his laughing;<br>\
meaning he laughed so as to show his front teeth,<br>\
or his teeth.] ―<br>\
-b6-  And ضَحِكَ الزَّهْرُ (tropical:)  The flowers<br>\
[looked gay, or] were as though they were laughing.<br>\
(TA.) And ضَحِكَتِ الأَرْضُ (tropical:)  The earth, or land,<br>\
put forth its plants, or herbage, and its flowers.<br>\
(TA.) And ضَحِكَتِ الرِّيَاضُ عَنِ الأَزْهَارِ (tropical:)  The<br>\
meadows, or gardens, displayed the flowers. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  And ضَحِكَتِ النَّخْلَةُ (tropical:)  The palm-tree put forth<br>\
[or disclosed] its ضَحْك; as also ↓ أَضْحَكَت; (TA;)<br>\
[i. e.] the spathe of the palm-tree, (Skr, O, TA,)<br>\
that covered the طَلْع [or spadix], (O,) burst<br>\
open. (Skr, O, TA.) And ضَحِكَ الطَّلْعُ (tropical:)  The<br>\
طلع [here app. meaning the spathe of the<br>\
palm-tree] split, or clave, open; and so تَبَسَّمَ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And, as some assert, (ISd, TA,)<br>\
ضَحِكَتْ signifies also (tropical:)  She menstruated; said<br>\
of a hare; (ISd, Z, O, Msb, TA;) accord. to<br>\
some, from the ضَحَّاك [meaning the interior]<br>\
of the طَلْعَة [of the palm-tree] when it bursts<br>\
open; (ISd, TA;) and hence, (K, TA,) said<br>\
also in this sense of a woman, (O, Msb, K,<br>\
TA,) accord. to Mujáhid, (O, TA,) and some<br>\
others, (TA,) in the Kur xi. 74, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
where some read فَضَحَكَتْ, which is said to be<br>\
a well-known dial. var.; (TA;) and likewise,<br>\
accord. to some, said in this sense of the hyena,<br>\
(O, TA,) when she sees blood, or as IAar says,<br>\
when she eats the flesh of men and drinks their<br>\
blood: (TA:) [it is commonly asserted by the<br>\
Arabs that] the hare menstruates like women:<br>\
(Kzw:) but with respect to this meaning as<br>\
assigned to the verb in the Kur xi. 74, Fr<br>\
says that he had not heard it from any person<br>\
deserving of confidence; (O, TA; *) and Zj says<br>\
that it is nought: both say that the meaning<br>\
there is, she laughed by reason of happiness:<br>\
(TA:) and some say that there is an inversion<br>\
in this case, what is meant being فَبَشَّرْنَاهَا بِإِسْحٰقَ<br>\
فَضَحِكَتْ: (Fr, O, TA:) or the meaning is, she<br>\
wondered; so says I&#39;Ab; and so Er-Rághib,<br>\
who adds that it is confirmed by her saying,<br>\
“ shall I bring forth a child when I am an<br>\
old woman, and this my husband is an old man?<br>\
verily this is indeed a wonderful thing: ” and that<br>\
فَحَاضَتْ which is inserted by some of the expositors<br>\
after فَضَحِكَتْ is not an explanation of this expression, as some of them have imagined it to be, but<br>\
is the mention of [a fact which was] a sign that<br>\
the announcement was not that of an event<br>\
improbable: or the meaning is, she was frightened; so says Fr.: (TA:) and with respect to<br>\
the meaning of this verb when said of the hyena,<br>\
mentioned above, it is rejected by AHát and<br>\
others: (TA:) IDrd says, on the authority of<br>\
AHát, respecting the following verse of TaäbbataSharrà,<br>\
تَضْحَكُ الضَّبْعُ لِقَتْلَى هُذَيْلٍ<br>\
وَتَرَى الذِّئْبَ لَهَا يَسْتَهِلُّ<br>\
that the meaning is (assumed tropical:)  The hyena displays her<br>\
teeth, or grins, on account of the slain [of<br>\
Hudheyl], when she sees them, like as they<br>\
say of the ass when he plucks out the [plant<br>\
called] صِلِّيَانَة; (O, TA;) or, as others say,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  the hyena snarls, displaying her teeth; and<br>\
sees the wolf raising his voice in calling the<br>\
[other] wolves to them, i. e. to the slain: (O,<br>\
TA:*) Abu-l-&#39; Abbás says that the meaning is,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  the hyena displays her teeth, because the wolf<br>\
contends with her over the slain: and some say<br>\
that the poet means, (assumed tropical:)  the hyena rejoices because<br>\
of the slain. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  One says also, ضَحِكَتِ<br>\
السَّمُرَةُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  The سمرة [or gum-acacia-tree]<br>\
flowed with its gum: from ضحكت meaning<br>\
“ she menstruated. ” (Bd in xi. 74.)<br>\
3<br>\
مُضَاحَكَةٌ [inf. n. of ضاحكهُ] signifies [The<br>\
contending, or vying, in laughing, with another;<br>\
or the laughing with another; or] the laughing<br>\
together. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, النَّوْرُ<br>\
يُضَاحِكُ الشَّمْسَ (assumed tropical:)  [The flowers vie in brightness<br>\
with the sun]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And إِنَّ رَأْيَكَ لَيُضَاحِكُ<br>\
المُشْكِلَاتِ (tropical:)  [Verily thy judgment makes sport with<br>\
ambiguities]; said to him to whom confused and<br>\
dubious things are apparent and known. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اضحكهُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. إِضْحَاكٌ, (KL,)<br>\
said of God, (S, O,) or of a man, (K,) He<br>\
made him, or caused him, to laugh. (S, *  O, *<br>\
K, * KL, PS.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اضحك الضَّبُعَ, said<br>\
of blood, (TA,) or of the sword, (O, TA,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [It made the hyena to display her teeth; or<br>\
to snarl, displaying her teeth: or to rejoice:<br>\
(see 1, latter part:) but explained as meaning]<br>\
(tropical:)  it made the hyena to menstruate. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And اضحك الحَوْضَ (tropical:)  He filled the wateringtrough so that it overflowed: (O, TA:) its<br>\
glistening being likened to laughing. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\

تضاحك and ↓ تضحّك [are both mentioned in<br>\
the K and TA as though syn. with each other and<br>\
with ضَحِكَ: and accord. to the KL, the former<br>\
signifies He laughed: but accord. to the TK, the<br>\
latter signifies he manifested laughing: or]<br>\
the former is syn. with ↓ استضحك [app. as<br>\
meaning he affected to laugh, or laughing: or,<br>\
more exactly, agreeably with analogy, like the<br>\
contr. تَبَاكَى and اِسْتَبْكَى, the former signifies<br>\
thus; and the latter, he desired to laugh]. (S.)<br>\

They laugh together, one with another]. (K.)<br>\
