measure فِعْلُلٌ: (K:) but accord. to Th, there is<br>\
no word of this measure in the language; therefore, if these two have been heard, they are extr.,<br>\
unless, as Ibn-Keysán says, the ء be augmentative<br>\
[and there is no reason for supposing it to be so as<br>\
there is no known unaugmented word from the<br>\
root ضبل]: (S, O:) صِئْبُلٌ, however, with ص,<br>\
has been mentioned in the K, as having the same<br>\
meaning, and is said to be of the dial. of Dabbeh,<br>\
but not so well known as ضئبل, with ض; and<br>\
IB mentions نِئْدُلٌ, meaning [likewise the same,<br>\
or] “ incubus,” or “ nightmare: ” [but one of<br>\
these four instances may be excepted; for] it is<br>\
said in the K [in art. زَأبر] that زِئْبُرٌ may be incorrect. (TA.)<br>\
