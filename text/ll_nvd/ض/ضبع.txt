ضَبَعَهُ, aor.<br>\
ضَبَعَ, (S, K,) inf. n. ضَبْعٌ, (TK,)<br>\
He (a man, S) stretched forth towards him (another man, S) his upper arm (ضَبْعَهُ), for the purpose of striking. (S, K.) A poet says,<br>\
وَلَا صُلْحَ حَتَّى تَضْبَعُوَنا وَنَضْبَعَا<br>\
i. e. [And there shall be no peace] until ye stretch<br>\
forth towards us your upper arms with the<br>\
swords and we stretch forth our upper arms<br>\
towards you: or, accord. to AA, until ye stretch<br>\
forth [towards us] your upper arms for the<br>\
making of peace and the joining of hands [and we<br>\
do the same]. (S.) And one says, ضَبَعَ يَدَهُ إِلَيْهِ<br>\
بِالسَّيْفِ, meaning He stretched forth his arm<br>\
towards him with the sword. (K.) And ضَبَعَ عَلَى<br>\
فُلَانٍ, (S, * K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) He stretched<br>\
forth his upper arms for the purpose of uttering<br>\
an imprecation against such a one: (S, * K, TA:)<br>\
and hence, ضَبْعٌ is metaphorically used to signify<br>\
(tropical:)  the act of supplicating or imprecating; because<br>\
the person supplicating or imprecating raises his<br>\
hands and stretches forth his upper arms: and<br>\
ضِبَاعٌ, also, [app. an inf. n. of ↓ ضَابَعَ,] signifies<br>\
the raising the hands, or arms, in supplication or<br>\
imprecation. (TA.) And ضَبَعَتِ الخَيْلُ, and<br>\
الإِبِلُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
ضَبَعَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. ضَبْعٌ<br>\
(S, K) and ضُبُوعٌ and ضَبَعَانٌ, (K,) The horses,<br>\
and the camels, stretched forth their arms (أَضْبَاعَهَا,<br>\
S, Msb, K, i. e. أَعْضَادَهَا, S, Msb) in their going<br>\
along; (S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ ضبّعت, inf. n.<br>\
تَضْبِيعٌ: (S, K:) in [a copy of] the A expl. as<br>\
meaning مَدَّتْ أَعْنَاقَهَا [stretched forth their necks;<br>\
but this is probably a mistranscription, for مدّت<br>\
أَعْضَادَهَا]: (TA:) ضَبَعَت said of horses is like<br>\
ضَبَحَت, (K, TA,) which is a dial. var.: (TA:)<br>\
and ضَبَعَت said of a she-camel, inf. n. ضَبْعٌ, signifies the same as ↓ ضبّعت, as also ↓ أَضْبَعَت, on<br>\
the authority of IKtt: (TA:) [or,] accord. to<br>\
As, ضَبْعٌ signifies the lifting, (S,) or bending,<br>\
(TA,) of the hoof, (S, TA,) by a horse, and the<br>\
lifting of the foot, by a camel, (TA,) towards the<br>\
arm: (S, TA:) or it signifies the running a pace<br>\
above that which is termed تَقْرِيب: (O, K:) or<br>\
ضَبَعَ said of a camel signifies he hastened, or was<br>\
quick, (K, TA,) in pace, or going: (TA:) or he<br>\
went along shaking his arms. (K.) ضَبَعَهُ also<br>\
signifies He (a camel) took him (another camel)<br>\
by his arms, and threw him down. (L in art.<br>\
عضد, and TA in the present art.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ضَبَعُوا لِلصُّلْحِ,<br>\
(K, TA,) and للْمُصَافَحَةِ; (TA;) or ضَبَعُوا إِلَى<br>\
الصُّلْحِ; and ضَبِعُوا, inf. n. ضَبَعٌ; (Et-Toosee,<br>\
TA;) They inclined to peace, (Et-Toosee, K, TA,)<br>\
and the joining of hands; they desired peace, &amp;c.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ضَبَعُوا لَنَا الطَّرِيقَ, (S, K,) or مِنَ الطَّرِيقِ,<br>\
inf. n. ضَبْعٌ, (TA,) They gave us a share of the road:<br>\
(S, K:) so says ISk: (S:) and in like manner one<br>\
says, ذَرَعُوا لَنَاطَرِيقًا. (TA.) And ضَبَعُوا الشَّىْءَ,<br>\
(K, TA,) or مِنَ الشَّىْءِ, (TA,) They gave a share<br>\
of the thing (K, TA) to every one. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And ضَبَعَ, (K,) inf. n. ضَبْعٌ, (TA,) He (a man)<br>\
acted wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically: (K:) on the authority of Aboo-Sa&#39;eed.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  ضَبِعَت, aor.<br>\
ضَبَعَ, inf. n. ضَبَعٌ (S, K) and<br>\
ضَبَعَةٌ; (S, * K; [this latter is said in the TA, on<br>\
the authority of IAar, to have been used by an<br>\
Arab of the desert in relation to a woman; and<br>\
is, accord. to the S, app., a simple subst.;]) and<br>\
↓ أَضْبَعَت, (S, K,) and ↓ استضبعت; (K;) She<br>\
(a camel) desired (S, K) vehemently (S) the stallion.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
ضَبَّعَ see above, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  ضبّع فُلَانًا He<br>\
intervened between him and the object at which he<br>\
desired to shoot or cast. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
And ضبّع, inf. n. تَضْبِيعٌ, He was, or became,<br>\
cowardly, or weak-hearted: (Lth, K:) thus say<br>\
the vulgar; derived by them from الضَّبُعُ, because<br>\
this beast becomes still when one comes in upon<br>\
it, and then it goes forth. (Lth, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
ضَابَعْنَاهُمْ بِالسُّيُوفِ We stretched forth our<br>\
arms towards them with the swords, they stretching<br>\
theirs forth towards us [therewith]: so in the<br>\
“ Nawádir ” of AA. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, in<br>\
the former half. ―<br>\
-b3-  [The inf. n.] مُضَابَعَةٌ also signifies The joining of hands; syn. مُصَافَحَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَضْبَعَ see 1, near the middle of the paragraph:<br>\
-A2-<br>\
and also the last sentence of the same.<br>\
8<br>\
الاِضْطِبَاعُ, which the circuiter round the<br>\
House [of God, i. e. the Kaabeh,] is commanded<br>\
to perform, (S,) or in the case of the مُحْرِم, (K,)<br>\
is The putting the [garment called] رِدَآء under<br>\
one&#39;s right armpit, and turning back the extremity<br>\
thereof over his left [shoulder], exposing to view<br>\
his right shoulder [and arm] and covering the left;<br>\
(S, K, TA;) like the man that desires to labour<br>\
at a thing and prepares himself for doing so;<br>\
(TA;) thus termed because of exposing to view<br>\
one of the two upper arms: (S, K:) or the putting<br>\
one&#39;s garment (Mgh, Msb) under his right arm,<br>\
(Mgh,) or under his right armpit, (Msb,) and<br>\
throwing [a portion of] it upon his left shoulder:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) or the taking the إِزَار or the بُرْد,<br>\
and putting the middle of it under one&#39;s right<br>\
armpit, and throwing the extremity thereof upon<br>\
his left shoulder, over his breast and his back:<br>\
(IAth, TA:) التَّأَبُّطُ and التَّوَشُّحُ likewise signify<br>\
the same: so says Az: (Msb:) and so says As<br>\
of the former: (S:) and it is also written الاِطِّبَاعُ.<br>\
(Thus in the TA in explanation of التَّأَبُّطُ.) You<br>\
say, اِضْطَبَعَ بِثَوْبِهِ [He attired himself with his<br>\
garment in the manner described above]. (Mgh,<br>\
Msb.) And اضطبع الشَّىْءَ He put the thing under<br>\
his upper arms. (TA. [But accord. to the Mgh,<br>\
the verb is trans., correctly, only by means of بِ.])<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَضْبَعَ see 1, last sentence.<br>\
ضَبْعٌ The عَضُد [i. e. upper arm of a human<br>\
being, and arm of a quadruped], (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) altogether: (K:) or the middle thereof,<br>\
(Lth, Mgh, O, K,) with its flesh: (O, K:) and<br>\
the inner side thereof: (Mgh:) or (so in some<br>\
copies of the K, but in others “ and,”) the armpit:<br>\
or the portion, of the upper part of the عَضُد, that<br>\
is between the armpit and the half of the former:<br>\
(K:) it is of man and of other than man: (TA:)<br>\
pl. أَضْبَاعٌ. (S, Msb, K.) One says, أَبَدَّ ضَبعَيْهِ,<br>\
[expl. in art. بد,] speaking of a man praying.<br>\
(O, TA.) And أَخَذْتُ بِضَبْعَىْ فُلَانٍ فَلَمْ أُفَارِقْهُ<br>\
and مَدَدْتُ بِضَبْعَيْهِ, meaning I seized the middle<br>\
of the upper arms of such a one [and did not<br>\
relinquish him]. (Lth, O, TA.) And جَذَبَهُ بِضَبْعَيْهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  He raised him, or set him up, and rendered his<br>\
name famous: and in like manner, أَخَذَ بِضَبْعَيْهِ,<br>\
and مَدَّ بِضَبْعَيْهِ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Any [hill such as<br>\
is termed] أَكَمَة that is black and somewhat oblong.<br>\
(IAar, K.)<br>\
-A3-  ذَهَبَ بِهِ ضَبْعًا لَبْعًا means بَاطِلًا<br>\
[i. e., app., He took it away with a false pretence;<br>\
or in play, or sport]; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K, TA;)<br>\
namely, a thing; (O, TA;) لَبْعًا being an imitative<br>\
sequent. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  See also ضَبُعٌ.<br>\
-A5-  And see<br>\
what here next follows.<br>\
كُنَّا فِى ضُبْعِ فُلَانٍ (S, O, K) and فلان ↓ ضَبْعِ<br>\
and فلان ↓ ضِبْعِ (K) We were in the protection,<br>\
or quarter, (كَنَف, and نَاحِيَة,) of such a one. (S,<br>\
O, K: but in the K, هُوَ is put in the place of<br>\
كُنَّا.)<br>\
كُنَّا فِى ضِبْعِ فُلَانٍ: see what next precedes.<br>\
ضَبُعٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and ↓ ضَبْعٌ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) the former of the dial. of Keys and the<br>\
latter of the dial. of Temeem, (Msb,) [The female<br>\
hyena; or the hyena, male and female;] a certain<br>\
animal of prey, (سَبُعٌ, [but see what follows,]) (K,)<br>\
well known, (S, O,) the worst, or most abominable,<br>\
of سِبَاع, (Mgh,) resembling the wolf, except that,<br>\
when it runs, it is as though it were lame, wherefore it is called العَرْجَآءُ: it flees from him who<br>\
holds in his hand a colocynth: [and they assert<br>\
that] the dogs bark not at him who retains with<br>\
him its teeth: if its skin is bound upon the belly<br>\
of her that is pregnant, she casts not her young:<br>\
if seed is measured in a measure covered with<br>\
its skin, the seed-produce is secure from the banes<br>\
thereof: and the application of its gall-bladder as<br>\
a collyrium sharpens the sight: (K:) it is not<br>\
reckoned among the hostile animals to which the<br>\
appellation of سَبُعٌ is applied, wherefore the<br>\
Sunneh allows that its flesh may be eaten, and<br>\
requires that a compensation be made for it [by<br>\
the sacrifice of a ram] if it be smitten [and killed]<br>\
in the sacred territory by a person in the state of<br>\
ihrám: (TA voce سَبُعٌ:) the word is of the fem.<br>\
gender, (S, * Mgh, * O, * Msb, K, *) and is [said to<br>\
be] applied peculiarly to the female; (Msb;) the<br>\
male being called ↓ ضِبْعَانٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
of which the pl. is ضَبَاعِينُ; (S, O, Msb, K;) but<br>\
AHát disapproved this pl.; (O;) and the female is<br>\
called [also] ↓ ضِبْعَانَةٌ, of which the pl. is ضِبْعَانَاتٌ;<br>\
(S, O, K;) or ضِبْعَانَةٌ has not been heard applied<br>\
to the female, but ضَبُعٌ only, and it seems that J<br>\
has mentioned ضِبْعَانَةٌ as applied to the female<br>\
from his having supposed ضِبْعَانَاتٌ to be pl. of<br>\
ضِبْعَانَةٌ, whereas it is pl. of ضِبْعَانٌ, being like<br>\
رِجَالَاتٌ and جِمَالَاتٌ: (IB in a marginal note in<br>\
one of my copies of the S:) but some say that<br>\
ضَبُعٌ or ضَبْعٌ is applied to the male; and the<br>\
female is termed ضَبْعَةٌ, thus with a quiescent<br>\
letter: (Msb:) or, accord. to Ibn-&#39;Abbád, the<br>\
female is termed ضَبُعَةٌ, and its pl. [or rather the<br>\
coll. gen. n.] is ضَبُعٌ; (O, K;) or ضَبَعَةٌ is not<br>\
allowable: (S, K:) the pl. of ضَبُعٌ or ضَبْعٌ is<br>\
أَضْبُعٌ, (K,) a pl. of pauc., (TA,) and ضِبَاعٌ, (K,)<br>\
or the former is pl. of ضَبْعٌ, (Msb,) and the latter<br>\
is pl. of ضَبُعٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) and is of the male<br>\
and of the female, (S, K,) and ضُبُعٌ, (K,) as<br>\
though this were pl. of ضِبَاعٌ, (AAF, TA,) and<br>\
ضُبعٌ [a contraction of ضُبُعٌ] (K) and ضُبُعَاتٌ and<br>\
ضُبُوعَةٌ (TA [in which it is indicated that this last<br>\
is pl. of ضَبْعٌ]) and [quasi-pl. n.] ↓ مَضْبَعَةٌ. (O,<br>\
K.) One says أَمْدَرُ ↓ ضِبْعَانٌ, [in the CK, erroneously, ضَبْعَانُ,] meaning, [A male hyena] inflated in the sides, big in the belly: or, accord. to<br>\
some, whose sides are defiled with earth, or dust.<br>\
(S.) And سَيْلٌ جَارُّ الضَّبُعِ A torrent that draws<br>\
forth the ضَبُع from its den; (O, K; in the CK,<br>\
جارٌّ الصَّبُعَ;) hence meaning (assumed tropical:)  a torrent produced<br>\
by vehement rain. (TA.) And دَلْجَةُ الضَّبُعِ [The<br>\
night-journeying of the hyena]; because the ضَبُع<br>\
goes round about until midnight. (O, K.) And<br>\
مَا يَخْفَى ذٰلِكَ عَلَى الضَّبُعِ [That is not unapparent<br>\
to the hyena]: because the ضَبُع is deemed stupid.<br>\
(TA.) أَحْمَقُ مِنَ الضَّبُعِ [More stupid than the<br>\
hyena] is a prov. (Meyd.) And أَكَلَتْهُمُ الضَّبُعُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [The hyena devoured them] is said of such as are<br>\
held in mean estimation. (TA.) [But this may<br>\
be otherwise rendered, as will be seen from what<br>\
follows.] The saying of a poet,<br>\
تَفَرَّقَتْ غَنَمِى يَوْمًا فَقُلْتُ لَهَا<br>\
يَا رَبِّ سَلِّطْ عَلَيْهَا الذِئْبَ وَالضَّبُعَا<br>\
[My sheep, or goats, dispersed themselves, one day,<br>\
and I said in relation to them, O my Lord, set<br>\
upon them the wolf and the hyena], is said to<br>\
mean an imprecation, that the wolf might kill the<br>\
living of them, and the hyena devour the dead of<br>\
them: or, as some say, it means that the speaker<br>\
prayed for their safety; because, when both fall<br>\
upon the sheep, or goats, each of them is diverted<br>\
from the sheep, or goats, by the other; and thus<br>\
means the saying, اَللّٰهُمَّ ضَبُعًا وَذِئْبًا [O God, send<br>\
a hyena and a wolf]: but the more probable<br>\
meaning of the poet is an imprecation, the consequence of his anger and fatigue; and the word<br>\
سَلِّطْ imports a notification of this meaning. (IB,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [The pl.] الضِّبَاعُ is applied to (assumed tropical:)  Numerous stars below بَنَات نَعْش: (O, K:) or [the<br>\
stars beta, gamma, delta and mu, of Bootes; i. e.] the star<br>\
upon the head, and that upon [each of] the<br>\
shoulders, and that upon the club, of العَوَّآء: and<br>\
the name of أَوْلَادُ الضِّبَاعِ is given to [The stars<br>\
q, i, k, and l, app. with some other faint stars<br>\
around these, of Bootes; i. e.] the stars upon the<br>\
left hand and fore arm, and what surround the<br>\
hand, of the faint stars, of العَوَّآء. (Kzw.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
الضَّبُعُ also signifies (tropical:)  The year of drought or<br>\
sterility or dearth; (S, IAth, O, Msb, K, TA;)<br>\
that is destructive; severe: of the fem. gender.<br>\
(TA.) So in a verse cited in art. اما [voce أَمَّا,<br>\
and again, with a variation, voce إِمَّا]. (S, O. [But<br>\
it is here said in the TA that الضَّبُعُ in this<br>\
instance means the animal of prey thus called.])<br>\
[Hence also,] it is related in a trad. of Aboo-Dharr, that a man said, يَا رَسُولَ اللّٰهِ أَكَلَتْنَا الضَّبُعُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [O Apostle of God, the year of drought has consumed us]: and he prayed for them. (TA.) [See<br>\
also two other exs. voce ذِئْبٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (tropical:)  Hunger.<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  Evil, or mischief.<br>\
(TA.) El-&#39;Okeyleeyeh said, “When a man whose<br>\
evil, or mischief, we feared removed from us, we<br>\
used to light a fire behind him: ” and being asked<br>\
“ Why? ” she said, لِيَتَحَوَّلَ ضَبُعُهُ مَعَهُ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  In<br>\
order that his evil, or mischief, might go away<br>\
with him. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
ضَبِعَةٌ A she-camel desiring [vehemently (see 1,<br>\
last sentence,)] the stallion; (Lth, K;) as also<br>\
↓ مُضْبِعَةٌ: (L, TA:) pl., accord. to the copies<br>\
of the K, ضَبَاعٌ and ضَبَاعَى; but in the L, ضِبَاعَى<br>\
and ضَبَاعَى: (TA:) and sometimes it is used in<br>\
relation to women. (K.)<br>\
ضِبْعَانٌ; and its fem., with ة: see ضَبُعٌ, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
ضَابِعٌ A she-camel stretching forth her arms<br>\
(أَضْبَاعَهَا, S, K, i. e. أَعْضَادَهَا, S) in going along:<br>\
(S, K:) or lifting her foot towards her arm in<br>\
going along: so accord. to an explanation by As<br>\
of the former of the two following pls.: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. is ضَوَابِعُ (Lth, As, TA) and ضُبَّعٌ. (TA.)<br>\
And A horse that runs vehemently; (O, K, TA;)<br>\
like ضَابِحٌ, of which the pl. is ضَوَابِحُ: (TA:) or<br>\
that runs much: (Lth, O, TA:) or that bends<br>\
his hoof towards his arm: (TA:) or that inclines<br>\
towards (lit. follows) one of his sides, and bends<br>\
his neck. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
أَضْبَعُ i. q. أَعْضَبُ [q. v.]; formed from the<br>\
latter by transposition. (TA.)<br>\
مَضْبَعَةٌ The portion of flesh that is beneath the<br>\
armpit, in the fore part. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
ضَبُعٌ [of which it is a quasi-pl. n.].<br>\
مُضْبِعَةٌ: see ضَبِعَةٌ.<br>\
مُضَبَّعَةٌ A she-camel whose breast is prominent<br>\
and whose arms recede. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
حِمَارٌ مَضْبُوعٌ An ass devoured by the ضَبُع [or<br>\
hyena]: (O, K:) or [an ass which may the hyena<br>\
devour, for] accord. to some it means an imprecation that the ضبع may devour him. (TA.)<br>\
