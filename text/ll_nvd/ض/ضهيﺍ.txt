ضَهْيَاَ [Accord. to the O and K, Q. Q. 1, being<br>\
mentioned therein in art. ضهأ.] ضَهْيَأَ أَمْرَهُ He<br>\
fell short of doing what he ought to have done in<br>\
his affair, (مَرَّضَهُ, O, K,) and did not decide it,<br>\
(لَمْ يَصْرِمْهُ, O,) or and did not perform it firmly,<br>\
or soundly: (K:) like رَهْيَأَ. (TA.)<br>\
ضَهْيَأٌ, of the measure فَعْلَلٌ, or, as some say,<br>\
فَعْيَلٌ; if of the latter, [said to be] the only instance of this measure in the language; ضَهْيَدٌ<br>\
being a foreign proper name; (TA;) or,<br>\
مَرْيَمُ being a foreign proper name; (TA;) or,<br>\
accord. to Sb, the hemzeh in ضَهْيَأٌ, which is with<br>\
tenween, is augmentative, because it is syn. with<br>\
ضَهْيَآءُ, which is with the long ا and imperfectly<br>\
decl., for the ى cannot be augmentative and the<br>\
hemzeh radical in the latter; (MF and TA in<br>\
art. ضهى;) [a word like ضَهْيًا and ضَهْيَآءُ (which<br>\
see in art. ضهى) in most, or a some seem to<br>\
say in all, of its meanings;] A certain tree,<br>\
resembling the سَيَال, (AZ, O, K,) each of which<br>\
has its fruit in a سِنْفَة [or pod]; it has weak<br>\
thorns, and grows in the valleys and on the mountains: (AZ, O:) Ed-Deenawaree [i. e. AHn]<br>\
says, on the authority of some one or more of the<br>\
Arabs of the desert, of El-Azd, that the ضهيأ is a<br>\
great tree of the kind called عِضَاه, having a بَرَمَة<br>\
[q. v.] and a pod (عُلَّّفَة) [which succeeds the بَرَمَة],<br>\
and many thorns; its pods (عُلَّف) are intensely<br>\
red, and its leaves are like those of the [species of<br>\
acacia called] سَمُر. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A woman that<br>\
does not menstruate: and that has neither milk<br>\
nor breast: as also ↓ ضَهْيَأَةٌ: (K:) or the latter<br>\
is an epithet applied to a woman in these two<br>\
senses: (O: [in which the former word, without<br>\
ة, is not mentioned:]) Seer says, in his Expos.<br>\
of “ the Book ” of Sb, that ضَهْيَأٌ, like ضَهْيَآءُ<br>\
[which belongs to art. ضهى], is a subst. as well<br>\
as an epithet, signifying a woman whose breast<br>\
has not grown forth: and one who has not menstruated: ―<br>\
-b2-  and also (assumed tropical:)  A land that has not<br>\
given growth to anything: (MF, TA:) or ↓ ضَهْيَأَةٌ<br>\
signifies as above: and also (assumed tropical:)  a desert (فَلَاةٌ)<br>\
having in it no water: (O, K, TA:) or that does<br>\
not give growth to anything; app. because it has<br>\
no water. (TA.) [Accord. to those who hold<br>\
the ى to be augmentative,] a woman is thus<br>\
termed because she resembles men (لِأَنَّهَا ضَاهَأَتِ<br>\
الرِّجَالَ). (O, TA.)<br>\
ضَهْيَأَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
