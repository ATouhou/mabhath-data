ضَعَا He hid, or concealed, himself. (ISd, K.)<br>\
ضَعَةٌ, (S, K,) originally ضَعْوٌ, or ضَعَوٌ, (accord.<br>\
to different copies of the S,) the ة being a substitute [for the و], because of the form of its pl. [and<br>\
of the rel. n.]; or, as some say, the ة is a substitute for an initial و, and it is mentioned also in<br>\
art. وضع; (S;) A species of tree, (S, K, TA,) in<br>\
the desert: or it is [a plant] like the [species of<br>\
panic grass called] ثُمَام: (TA:) accord. to Az,<br>\
a species of ثُمَام: (TA in art. ثم:) or another<br>\
plant: and some pronounce it ضِعَةٌ; but this is<br>\
in الحَسَب [or grounds of pretension to respect<br>\
&amp;c.], and does not belong to the present art.:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. is ضَعَوَاتٌ. (S, TA.) [Golius says,<br>\
on the authority of Meyd, that it also signifies<br>\
The reed of which writing-reeds are made.]<br>\
