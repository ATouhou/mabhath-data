the poor-rates in El-Yemen, where was the present<br>\
which he had brought for his wife, and he<br>\
answered, (L,) كَانَ عَلَىَّ ضَاغِطٌ [There was over<br>\
me a watcher], (S,) or كَانَ مَعِى ضَاغِطٌ [There<br>\
was with me a watcher], meaning God, who<br>\
knows the secrets of men; or he meant, by<br>\
ضاغط, the trust committed to him by God, which<br>\
he had taken upon himself; but his wife imagined<br>\
that there was with him a watcher who straitened<br>\
him, and prevented his taking to please her. (L.)<br>\
