-A8-  [ضَبَّ and ↓ ضبّب, each probably followed by عَلَى, seem to signify sometimes It<br>\
covered a thing, and became intermixed with it:<br>\
the inf. ns. الضبب (which I think to be a mistranscription for الضَّبُّ) and التضبيب are expl. in<br>\

said that] اضبّ عَلَيْهِ also signifies He was at the<br>\
point of getting possession of it, namely, a thing<br>\
(O, K) that he sought, or desired. (K.) [But<br>\
it seems from a passage in the TA, in which is an<br>\

originated by Lth, for أَضْبَى.]<br>\
-A2-  اضبّ السِّقَآءُ The<br>\

also ↓ ضَبَّ [aor.<br>\

these verbs have also a contr. meaning:]) and he<br>\

clamour, or confused noise. (TA.) And اضبّ<br>\
القَوْمُ The people, or party, spoke, one to another:<br>\
(TA:) or spoke; and entered, or launched forth,<br>\

ضَبٌّ [A species of lizard; termed lacerta<br>\
caudiverbera, from its habit of striking with its<br>\
tail; (see جَرَشَ;) Forskål (Descr. Animalium,<br>\
p. 13,) terms it lacerta Aegyptia; referring to<br>\
Hasselquist, p. 302; and adds the following<br>\
description: “ femora teretia sine verrucis: cauda<br>\
verticillata non longa: squamæ patentes, subconicæ<br>\
mucronatæ: corpus nudum, rugosum: ”] a certain<br>\
reptile, or small creeping thing, (S, TA,) of those<br>\
termed حَشَرَات, (TA,) well known; (K, TA;)<br>\
resembling the وَرَل [q. v., but not so long]: (TA:)<br>\
or resembling the حِرْذَون [q. v.]; of which there<br>\
are two species, one of the size of the حرذون, and<br>\
one larger: (Msb:) accord. to &#39;Abd-El-Káhir,<br>\
of the size of a little young crocodile; having a<br>\
tail like the tail of the latter: it assumes various<br>\
colours when exposed to the sun, like as does the<br>\
chameleon; lives seven hundred years; drinks not<br>\
water, being satisfied with the air; voids one drop<br>\
of urine in every forty days; its teeth consist of<br>\
one curved piece; when it has quitted its hole it<br>\
knows it not; and it lays eggs, like a bird: so say<br>\
IKh and Dmr and others: AM says, the وَرَل is<br>\
of a lank make, with a long tail; the latter<br>\
resembling that of a serpent; and the length of<br>\
some exceeds two cubits; but the tail of the ضبّ<br>\
is jointed, and its utmost length is a span: the<br>\
Arabs deem the ورل a foul and filthy thing, and<br>\
do not eat it; but they are eager to hunt and eat<br>\
the ضبّ: this animal has a rough tail, serrated<br>\
with jags resembling vertebræ; its colour inclines<br>\
to a blackish dusty hue; and when it becomes fat,<br>\
its breast becomes yellow; it eats nothing but [the<br>\
locusts called] جَنَادِب, and young locusts before<br>\
their wings have grown (دَبًا), and herbage, not<br>\
venomous or noxious reptiles; whereas the ورل<br>\
eats scorpions and serpents and chameleons and<br>\
beetles: its flesh is an antidote against poisons,<br>\
and women grow fat upon it: (L, TA:) it is the<br>\
longest, of the animals, in retaining the remains<br>\
of life: (O:) [see also مُطَبِّخٌ:] the fem. is with<br>\
ة: (S, O, Msb, K:) and the pl. [of pauc.] is<br>\
أَضُبٌّ and [of mult.] ضِبَابٌ (S, O, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K) and ضُبَّانٌ, (K,) which last Lh particularizes<br>\
as used to denote a great number, but ISd sees<br>\
no reason for this distinction, (TA,) and [quasipl. n.] ↓ مَضَبَّةٌ, (O, K,) like as مَشْيَخَةٌ is of شَيْخٌ,<br>\
(O,) this last on the authority of As, as heard by him<br>\
from more than one of the Arabs. (TA.) Hence<br>\
one says رَجُلٌ خَبٌّ ضَبٌّ (tropical:)  [A very deceitful or<br>\
mischievous, and] an abominable, guileful, ireful<br>\
man: (TA:) or a very deceitful or mischievous<br>\
or wicked, and guileful man: (S:) likened to the<br>\
[lizard called] ضَبّ on account of his guilefulness:<br>\
and in like manner, اِمْرَأَةٌ خَبَّةٌ ضَبَّةٌ. (A, TA.)<br>\
And أَخْدَعُ مِنَ الضَّبِّ More guileful than the<br>\
ضبّ: (A, TA:) a prov. (TA.) And أَعَقُّ مِنْ<br>\
ضَبٍّ [More undutiful to kindred than a ضبّ];<br>\
because the ضبّ often eats its حُسُول [or young<br>\
ones when they have just come forth from the<br>\
eggs]: another prov.: (S:) أَبُو حِسْلٍ is a surname of the ضبّ. (TA.) One says also أَطْوَلُ<br>\
ذَمَآءً مِنَ الضَّبِّ, another prov. [expl. in art. ذمى].<br>\
(O.) And أَحْيَرُ مِنْ ضَبٍّ, which is likewise a<br>\
prov. [expl. in art. حير]. (Har p. 166.) And<br>\
أَتُعْلِمُنِى بِضَبٍّ أَنَا حَرَشْتُهُ, another prov. [expl. in<br>\
art. حرش]. (TA.) And لَا أَفْعَلُهُ حَتَّى يَحِنَّ<br>\
الضَّبُّ فِى إِثْرِ الإِبِلِ الصَّادِرَةِ [I will not do it until<br>\
the ضبّ utters a yearning cry at the heels of the<br>\
camels returning from water]: and لَا أَفْعَلُهُ حَتَّى<br>\
يَرِدَ الضَّبُّ [I will not do it until the ضبّ comes to<br>\
water: i. e. I will never do it:] because the ضبّ<br>\
does not drink water. (S, O.) كَفُّ الضَّبِّ<br>\
[means The paw of the ضبّ]: to this the Arabs<br>\
liken the hand of the niggard when he fails to give:<br>\
(TA:) and it is also applied by way of comparison to (tropical:)  a niggard himself: and to denote<br>\
(tropical:)  shortness and littleness. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence also,]<br>\
(tropical:)  Rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite, (S, A, O,<br>\
Msb, K, TA,) latent in the heart; (A, TA;) like the<br>\
[lizard called] ضبّ hiding itself in the furthest<br>\
extremity of its hole: (A:) and anger, wrath, or<br>\
rage: (K:) or rancour, &amp;c., or vehement rancour,<br>\
&amp;c., and enmity: (TA:) and ↓ ضِبٌّ signifies<br>\
the same: (K:) the pl. is ضِبَابٌ, and [app. ضِبَبٌ<br>\
also, for] the phrase كُلٌّ مِنْهُمَا حَامِلُ ضِبَبٍ لِصَاحِبِهِ<br>\
[Each of them a bearer of latent rancours &amp;c.<br>\
towards his fellow] occurs in a trad. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also A certain disease in the lip, (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) in consequence of which it flows with<br>\
blood, (S, O, Msb,) or swells, and becomes hard,<br>\
or dry and hard, and flows with blood. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And A tumour in the breast of a camel.<br>\
(O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A tumour (S, O, K) in the خُفّ,<br>\
(so in copies of the K [i. e. foot], in the TA انف<br>\
[which is, I doubt not, a mistranscription],) or<br>\
in the فِرْسِن, [which means the same, or the<br>\
extremity of the foot,] (S, O,) of the camel. (S,<br>\
O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A disease in the elbow of a camel;<br>\
(K, TA;) said to be its cutting into his skin [by<br>\
rubbing against it]; or its being distorted, and<br>\
falling against his side, so as to gall it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And A chapping, or cracking, (اِنَفِتَاقٌ,) [in the<br>\
crease] of the armpit [of a child, or of a camel],<br>\
and abundance of flesh: (S, O, TA:) El-<br>\
&#39;Adebbes El-Kinánee gives the same explanation,<br>\
and says that this is what is also termed ضَاغِطٌ.<br>\
(TA. [See 5.])<br>\
-A3-  Also The طَلْع [i. e. the spadix,<br>\
or the spathe,] of the palm-tree: pl. ضِبَابٌ: (S,<br>\
O:) or ↓ ضَبَّةٌ signifies, (K, TA,) and so ضَبٌّ,<br>\
(TA,) [but the latter seems to be a coll. gen. n.,<br>\
and the former its n. un.,] a طَلْعَة [meaning<br>\
spathe of a palm-tree] before it cleaves open (K,<br>\
TA) from [around] the غَرِيض [or spadix]. (TA.)<br>\
ضِبٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph, latter<br>\
half.<br>\
ضَبَّةٌ [an inf. n. un. of ضَبَّ: as such signifying]<br>\
A single bleeding of the gum [&amp;c.]. (Ham pp. 28<br>\
and 274.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, last sentence but one.<br>\
-A2-  Also A single [lizard of the species termed]<br>\
ضَبّ [q. v.]. (S, O, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The skin<br>\
of a [lizard of the species termed] ضَبّ, tanned for<br>\
clarified butter (K, TA) to be put into it. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A broad piece of iron with which a door<br>\
(or wood, TA) is clamped or strengthened (يُضَبَّبُ):<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, K, TA:) or a piece of iron or brass<br>\
or the like, with which a vessel is repaired: (Msb:)<br>\
[a word still used in these senses; commonly applied to a flat piece of iron or the like, which is<br>\
nailed across a crack in a wooden vessel or a similar<br>\
thing: and a band of metal which is affixed around<br>\
a cracked vessel: (see an ex. voce عَصَبَ:) also to<br>\
a kind of wooden lock, figured and described in<br>\
the Introduction to my work on the Modern<br>\
Egyptians:] what is first described above is so<br>\
called because it is broad, like the reptile so<br>\
termed; and also كَتِيفَةٌ, because it is broad, like<br>\
a كَتِف [or shoulder-blade]: (AM, TA:) pl. ضَبَّاتٌ<br>\
(A, Msb, TA) and ضِبَابٌ. (A, TA.) The ضَبَّة of<br>\
a knife is The جُزْءَة [thereof; app. meaning a<br>\
ferrule, or similar thing, affixed around the handle,<br>\
next the blade, like the band of metal thus called<br>\
which is affixed around a cracked vessel (as<br>\
mentioned above); though جُزْءَةٌ generally means<br>\
