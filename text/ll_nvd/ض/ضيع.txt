ضَاعَ, aor. يَضِيعُ, inf. n. ضَيَاعٌ and ضَيْعَةٌ (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, K) and ضَيْعٌ and ضِيعٌ, (K,) It (a<br>\
thing, S, Mgh, O, Msb) perished, came to nought,<br>\
passed away, or became lost. (S, O, Msb, K.)<br>\
It is said in a trad. of Saad, إِنِّى أَخَافُ عَلَى<br>\
الأَعْنَابِ الضَّيْعُةَ i. e. [Verily I fear, for the<br>\
grapes,] their [lit. the] perishing, or becoming lost.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And ضاع, (K, TA,) inf. n. ضَيَاعٌ and<br>\
ضَيْعَةٌ, (TA,) It (a thing) was left; left, or let,<br>\
alone; or neglected. (K, TA.) Hence, ضاعت<br>\
الإِبِلُ, and ضاع العِيَالُ, The camels, and the family,<br>\
or household, were left untended, and unminded;<br>\
and were left alone, or neglected. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  ضاع,<br>\
aor. يَضِيعُ, said of perfume, or sweet odour, i. q.<br>\
ضاع having for its aor. يَضُوعُ. (Har p. 670.)<br>\
[See 5 in art. ضوع: and see also 5 in the present<br>\
art.]<br>\

ضيّع الشَّىْءَ, (O, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَضْيِيعٌ;<br>\
(S;) and ↓ اضاعهُ, (O, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِضَاعَةٌ;<br>\
(S;) both signify the same; (S, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
He made, or caused, the thing to perish, or become lost; he destroyed it, wasted it, or lost it.<br>\
(Msb, K, TA.) Hence, ضَيَّعُوا فُلَانًا is used by<br>\
the vulgar as meaning They beheaded such a one<br>\
with the sword. (TA.) It is said in a prov.,<br>\
الصَّيْفَ ضَيَّعْتِ اللَّبَنَ [In the spring, or in the summer, thou losedst the milk], in which the ت is<br>\
with kesr when the words are addressed to a<br>\
male, or to a female, or to a pl. number, because<br>\
originally addressed to a woman, the wife of a<br>\
wealthy man, whom she disliked because of his<br>\
being aged, wherefore he divorced her, and a poor<br>\
man married her, and she sent to her first<br>\
husband requesting a gift, and he answered her<br>\
thus; (S, O, K; *) الصيف being in the accus. case<br>\
as an adv. n.: so says Yaakoob: (S, O:) or<br>\
El-Aswad Ibn-Hurmuz divorced his wife El-<br>\
&#39; Anood Esh-Shenneeyeh, (O, K,) of the BenooShenn, (TA,) preferring to her a beautiful and<br>\
wealthy woman of his people; (O, K; *) then<br>\
there occurred between them what led to their<br>\
separation, and he sought to obtain [again] El-<br>\
&#39; Anood, and sent a message to her; but in replying to him she said,<br>\
أَنْشَأْتَ تَطْلُبُ وَصْلَنَا<br>\
فِى الصَّيْفِ ضَيَّعْتَ اللَّبَنْ<br>\
[Thou hast begun to seek our union: in the spring,<br>\
or in the summer, thou losedst the milk]: (O, *<br>\
K:) the ت in this case being with fet-h. (K.<br>\
[See more in Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 197-8, or<br>\
in Har p. 577; in both of which, however, and<br>\
in the O, ضيّعت is with kesr in the latter case,<br>\
as in the former.]) [One says also, ضيّع عَهْدَهُ,<br>\
meaning He broke his compact, contract, or<br>\
covenant]. The phrase, in a trad., نَهَى عَنْ<br>\
المَالِ ↓ إِضَاعَةِ means He forbade the expending of<br>\
wealth otherwise than in obedience to God, and<br>\
the squandering thereof, and extravagance. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
اضاع الشَّىْءَ: see 2, first sentence, and last<br>\
but one. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, [and app. ↓ ضيّعهُ likewise,<br>\
accord. to the K,] He left the thing; left it, or<br>\
let it, alone; or neglected it. (K, TA.) You<br>\
say, اضاع عِيَالَهُ He neglected his family, or household; omitted taking good care of them, or being<br>\
mindful of them. (TA.) وَمَا كَانَ اللّٰهُ لِيُضِعَ<br>\
إِيمَانَكُمْ, in the Kur [ii. 138], means And God<br>\
will not neglect [or make to be lost] your prayer.<br>\
(TA.) أَضَاعُوا الصَّلَاةَ, in the same, [xix. 60,]<br>\
means Who neglected, or omitted, prayer, (Bd,<br>\
TA,) altogether: (TA:) or deferred it: (Bd:)<br>\
or who performed it in other than its right time:<br>\
but the first explanation is more suitable, for the<br>\
unbelievers are meant thereby. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اضاع<br>\
[is also intrans., and] may signify He found his<br>\
affair to be coming to nought. (Ham p. 33.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And His estates (ضِيَاعُهُ) became wide-spread, (S,<br>\
O, K,) and many, or numerous. (S, O, Msb, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تضيّع, said of the wind, It blew: because it<br>\
[often] destroys that upon which it blows: so says<br>\
Er-Rághib. (TA. [But it may be from what here<br>\
follows.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Said of musk, It diffused its odour,<br>\
or fragrance: (S, O, K;) a dial. var. of تضوّع:<br>\
(S:) or an instance of substitution [of ى for و].<br>\
(O.) [See also 1, last explanation.]<br>\
مَاتَ ضِيْعًا and ضِيَعًا: see ضَيَاعٌ.<br>\
ضَيْعَةٌ an inf. n. of 1. (S, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See ضَيَاعٌ,<br>\
below, last sentence but one. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A single<br>\
case, or occasion, of perishing, coming to nought,<br>\
passing away, or becoming lost; or of being left,<br>\
left or let alone, or neglected. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  تَرَكْتُهُ<br>\
بِضَيْعَةٍ means I left him unsought-after, or unminded, or unmissed. (TA. [See also a similar<br>\
phrase voce ضَيَاعٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. عَقَارٌ [meaning<br>\
An estate consisting of land, or of land and a<br>\
house, or of a house or land yielding a revenue, or<br>\
of a house and palm-trees, or the like]; (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K;) and [particularly] land yielding a<br>\
revenue; (K;) or with the people of the towns<br>\
and villages and cultivated lands it signifies the<br>\
property, of a man, consisting of palm-trees and<br>\
grape-vines and land: but the Arabs [of the<br>\
desert] know not the word in this sense: (Az,<br>\
TA:) IF says, I do not reckon the application<br>\
of this word as a name for the عَقَار to be of the<br>\
original language, but think it to be an innovation<br>\
in speech; and I have heard it said that this is<br>\
termed a ضيعة because, when frequent attention to<br>\
it is neglected, it perishes; and if it be so, this is<br>\
an evidence of what we have said, that it is of the<br>\
innovated speech: (O, TA:) the dim. is ↓ ضُيَيْعَةٌ,<br>\
for which one should not say ضُوَيْعَةٌ: (S, O, K:)<br>\
the pl. is ضِيَاعٌ and ضِيَعٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) as<br>\
though the latter were a contraction of the<br>\
former, (Msb,) and ضَيْعَاتٌ: (K:) accord. to Lth,<br>\
the first of these pls. signifies places of alighting<br>\
or abode or settlement; which are thus called because, when the paying frequent attention to<br>\
them, or taking good care of them, and the keeping them, or putting them, in a good state, or state<br>\
of repair, is neglected, they come to nought: and<br>\
ضَيْعَاتٌ occurs in a trad. as meaning the means of<br>\
subsistence. (TA.) And, (T, O, Msb, K,) as<br>\
used by the Arabs [of the desert], who know not<br>\
the word in any other sense than this, (T, O,) A<br>\
craft, or handicraft, by which one gains his subsistence; a mode, or manner, of gain; or any<br>\
habitual work or occupation of a man; (T, O,<br>\
Msb, K) as the sewing of skins or boots and the<br>\
like; and the twisting of ropes; and the weaving,<br>\
or plaiting, of palm-leaves; and the culture of<br>\
palm-trees (عَمَلُ النَّخْلِ); and the pasturing of<br>\
camels; and the like thereof; (T, O;) including<br>\
the sowing, or tilling, of land: (TA:) or the<br>\
ضَيْعَة of the Arabs was the management, or tending, of camels and of sheep and goats: and the<br>\
term includes a man&#39;s craft, or handicraft, or<br>\
means of gain: (Sh, O:) and his traffic: (Sh,<br>\
O, K:) one says to a man, قُمْ إِلَى ضَيْعَتِكَ [Arise<br>\
to thy craft, &amp;c.]: (Sh, O:) and كُلُّ رَجُلٍ<br>\
وَضَيْعَتَهُ, [Every man should occupy himself<br>\
with his proper craft, &amp;c.] (Msb.) أَفْشَى اللّٰهُ,<br>\
ضَيْعَتَهُ, occurring in a trad., means God made or<br>\
may God make, his means of subsistence to be<br>\
abundant. (TA.) And one says, فَشَتْ ضَيْعَتُهُ,<br>\
[or, more commonly, فَشَتْ عَلَيْهِ ضَيْعَتُهُ, as in the<br>\
TA in art. فشو, &amp;c.,] which is said to mean His<br>\
property was, or became, large, or abundant, [or<br>\
wide-spread,] so that he was unable to collect it<br>\
together: and [hence] his means of attaining his<br>\
object [or his affairs (as in the TA in art. فشو)]<br>\
became disordered so that he knew not with which<br>\
of them to begin: (TA:) or he took to doing an<br>\
affair that did not concern him: (TA, and Ham<br>\
p. 33:) it is nearly like the saying اِتَّسَعَ الخَرْقُ<br>\
عَلَى الرَّاقِعِ [expl. in art. خرق]. (Ham ibid.)<br>\
And إِنِّى لَأَرَى ضَيْعَةً لَا يُصْلِحُهَا إِلَّا ضَجْعَةٌ [Verily<br>\
I see property that nothing but a sleep will<br>\
restore to a right state] a prov.; said by a pastor<br>\
whose camels had dispersed themselves, and who,<br>\
desiring to collect them together, and being unable to do so, sought aid of sleep. (O.)<br>\
مَاتَ ضِيعَةً: see the next paragraph.<br>\
ضَيَاعٌ an inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (S, &amp;c.) [Hence]<br>\
one says, مَاتَ ضَيَاعًا, as also ↓ ضِيَعًا, and ↓ ضِيْعًا,<br>\
and ↓ ضِيعَةٌ, He (a man, TA) died unsought-after,<br>\
or unminded, or unmissed. (K, TA. [See also a<br>\
similar phrase voce ضَيْعَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A family,<br>\
or household: (ISh, O, K:) or the meaning is<br>\
عِيَالٌ ضُيَّعٌ, (Mgh, O, K, *) i. e. a family, or<br>\
household, neglected, untended, and unminded;<br>\
(TA;) or such as are exposed, or liable, to perish,<br>\
(بِعَرَضِ أَنْ يَضِيعَ,) as young children, and those<br>\
who are crippled, or deprived of the power of<br>\
motion, who cannot manage their own affairs:<br>\
(Mgh:) occurring in a trad., in which it is said<br>\
that when a man died leaving such as are thus<br>\
termed, (تَرَكَ ضَيَاعًا,) they were to be brought to<br>\
the Prophet, (Mgh, O,) to be maintained by<br>\
means of the government-treasury: (Mgh:) a<br>\
prefixed noun is to be understood [i. e. it is for<br>\
عِيَالَ ضَيَاعٍ or the like]: (Mgh:) or it is an inf. n.<br>\
used as a subst. [properly thus termed]: (Mgh,<br>\
O:) or, accord. to one relation of the trad., the<br>\
word is ↓ ضَيْعَةً [which is likewise an inf. n., and<br>\
in this case to be expl. in the same manner]:<br>\
(Mgh:) if read ضِيَاعًا, it would be pl. of ضَائِعٌ.<br>\
(Mgh, O.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A sort of perfume, or odoriferous substance. (K.)<br>\
ضُيَيْعَةٌ dim. of ضَيْعَةٌ, q. v. (S, O, K.)<br>\

being left; left, or let, alone; or neglected:]<br>\
part. n. of 1: (Mgh, Msb:) pl. ضِيَاعٌ (Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K) and ضُيَّعٌ. (Mgh, O, * Msb, K. *) [See<br>\
an ex. of the latter pl. in a verse cited voce دَانَ,<br>\
in art. دين. See also سَائِعٌ, in art. سوع.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
A man in a state of poverty: or having a family,<br>\
or household, to sustain: or in a state of circumstances by means of which he is unable to subsist.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  فُلَانٌ يَأْكُلُ فِى مِعًى ضَائِعٍ means جَائِعٍ<br>\
[i. e. Such a one eats into a hungry, or an empty,<br>\
gut]: and it was said to the daughters of ElKhuss, “What is the sharpest thing? (مَا أَحَدُّ<br>\
شَىْء;) and she answered, نَابٌ جَائِعٌ يُلْقِى فِى<br>\
مِعًى ضَائِعٍ [A hungry canine tooth that throws<br>\
the food into an empty gut]. (S.)<br>\
أَضْيَعُ means أَكْثَرُ ضَيَاعًا: so in the saying,<br>\
فُلَانٌ أَضْيَعُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ [Such a one is in a more<br>\
perishing state than such a one]. (TA.)<br>\
مُضِيعٌ act. part. n. of the trans. v. اضاع. (TA.)<br>\

تَرَكَ عِيَالَهُ بِمَضِيعَةٍ or بِمَضْيَعَةٍ [He left his family,<br>\
or household, in a state of perishing, &amp;c.]. (Mgh.)<br>\
So too in the saying, السَّارِقُ لَا يُقْطَعُ فِى مَالٍ<br>\
بِمَضِيعَةٍ [The thief shall not suffer amputation of<br>\
his hand in the case of his stealing property in a<br>\
neglected state]. (Mgh.) And so in the saying,<br>\
هُوَ بِدَارِ مَضِيعَةٍ (S, * O, K) and مَضْيَعَةٍ (O, K) [He<br>\
is in a place (lit. an abode) of perdition, &amp;c.]:<br>\
