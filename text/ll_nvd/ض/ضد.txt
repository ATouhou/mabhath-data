ضَدَّهُ, (AZ, K,) first pers. ضَدَدْتُهُ, [aor.<br>\
ضَدُ3َ,]<br>\
inf. n. ضَدٌّ, He overcame him: (AZ, L:) and<br>\
also, (AZ, L,) or ضَدَّهُ فِى الخُصُومَةِ, (K,) He<br>\
overcame him in litigation, altercation, or contention. (AZ, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And ضَدَّهُ عَنْهُ He<br>\
averted him; turned him, or sent him, away, or<br>\
back; or caused him to return, or go back, or<br>\
revert; from it: (L, K:) i. e., a thing, or an<br>\
affair: (L:) and prevented, or hindered, him<br>\
from doing it; (K;) by gentle means: (L, K:)<br>\
as also صَدَّهُ: heard by Aboo-Turáb from Záïdeh.<br>\
(L.)<br>\
-A2-  ضَدَّ القِرْبَةِ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
ضَدُ3َ, (S,) inf. n.<br>\
ضَدٌّ, (AA, S,) He filled the water-skin. (S, K.)<br>\
3<br>\
ضادّهُ, (inf. n. مُضَادَّةٌ, Msb,) He, or it, was,<br>\
or became, contrary, opposed, or repugnant, to<br>\
him, or it; (AHeyth, S, * L, K;) said with<br>\
respect to two men when one desires what is<br>\
long, and the other, what is short; or one, darkness, and the other, light; or one, to pursue one<br>\
course, and the other, to pursue another:<br>\
(AHeyth, L:) or he, or it, was, or became,<br>\
separated from him, or it, by contrariety, opposition, or repugnance: (Msb:) [or, accord. to<br>\
the explanation of مُتَضَادَّانِ in the Msb, it was, or<br>\
became inconsistent with it.]<br>\
4<br>\
اضدّ He (a man, S) was, or became, angry.<br>\
(S, K.) It is not, as some assert it to be, a<br>\
quasi-pass. [of ضَدَّهُ], like as أَكَبَّ is of كَبَّهُ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَضَاْدَ3َ [تضادّا They two were, or became, contrary,<br>\
opposed, or repugnant, each to the other: or,<br>\
accord. to the explanation of مُتَضَادَّانِ in the Msb,<br>\
they two were, or became, inconsistent, each with<br>\
the other.]<br>\
ضِدٌّ (S, L, Msb, K) and ↓ ضَدِيدٌ (S, L, K) and<br>\
↓ ضَدِيدَةٌ (Th, M) The contrary, or opposite,<br>\
(AA, IAar, S, * M, Msb, K,) of a thing: (AA,<br>\
Msb:) or ضِدُّ شَىْءٍ signifies that which is repugnant to a thing, so that it would overcome it; as<br>\
black is to white, and death to life: (Lth, L:)<br>\
[or, accord. to the explanation of مُتَضَادَّانِ in the<br>\
Msb, that which is inconsistent with a thing:] pl.<br>\
of the first أَضَدَادٌ. (S, Msb, &amp;c.) One says also,<br>\
هُوَ ضِدُّكَ and ↓ ضَدِيدُكَ He is contrary, or opposed,<br>\
or repugnant, to thee; as when thou desirest what<br>\
is long, and he, what is short; or thou, darkness,<br>\
and he, light; or thou, to pursue one course, and<br>\
he, to pursue another. (AHeyth, L.) And ضِدٌّ<br>\
is sometimes a pl., (K,) or sometimes denotes a<br>\
collective body; (Akh, S, L;) as in the phrase<br>\
يَكُونُونَ عَلَيْهِمْ ضِدًّا, (S, L, K,) in the Kur [xix.<br>\
85], (S, L,) meaning They shall be adversaries,<br>\
or enemies, to them: (&#39;Ikrimeh, Jel:) or helpers<br>\
against them. (Fr, Jel.) One says also, القَوْمُ<br>\
عَلَىَّ ضِدٌّ وَاحِدٌ, meaning The people are assembled<br>\
together against me in contention, or altercation,<br>\
with me. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ضِدٌّ in lexicology signifies A<br>\
kind of مُشْتَرَك [or homonym]; being a word that<br>\
has two contrary meanings; as جَوْنٌ, which<br>\
means both “ black ” and “ white; ” and جَلَلٌ,<br>\
which means both “ great ” and “ small ” pl. as<br>\
above. (Mz, 26th نوع.) [ضِدٌّ is itself a word of<br>\
this kind, as is shown by what here follows.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (AA, Th, S, L, Msb, K,) and ↓ ضَدِيدٌ,<br>\
(S, L, K,) The like, or equal, (AA, Th, S, L,<br>\
Msb, K,) of a thing. (AA, Msb.) Thus they<br>\
have two contrary meanings. (K.) One says,<br>\
لَا ضِدَّ لَهُ and لَهُ ↓ لَا ضَدِيدَ There is no like, or<br>\
equal, to him, or it. (S, L.) And لَقِىَ القَوْمُ<br>\
أَضْدَادَهُمْ The people, or party, found, or met,<br>\
their equals, or fellows. (L.)<br>\
ضَدَدٌ: see ضَادٌّ.<br>\
ضَدِيدٌ: see ضَدٌّ, in four places.<br>\
ضَدِيدَةٌ: see ضِدٌّ, first sentence.<br>\
ضَادٌّ, or ↓ ضَادِدٌ and ↓ ضَدَدٌ One who fills<br>\
vessels for people when they seek, or demand,<br>\
water: pl. ضُدَدٌ, [which is anomalous,] on the<br>\
authority of AA. (L.)<br>\
ضَادِدٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
هُمَا مُتَضَادَّانِ They two are contrary, opposed,<br>\
or repugnant, each to the other: (S, * L, K:) or<br>\
they two are inconsistent; or such as cannot be,<br>\
or exist, together; as night and day. (Msb.)<br>\
