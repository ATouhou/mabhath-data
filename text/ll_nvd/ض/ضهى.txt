ضَهَىَ, inf. n. ضَهًى, She was, or<br>\
became, such as is termed ضَهْيَآء. (K.)<br>\
3<br>\
ضاهاهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. مُضَاهَاةٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) He resembled, or conformed with, him, or<br>\
it; syn. شَاكَلَهُ; (S, Msb, K;) like ضَاهَأَهُ [q. v.]:<br>\
(S, Msb:) and, like the latter, he imitated him.<br>\
(Msb, TA. *) It is said in a trad., أَشَدُّ النَّاسِ<br>\
عَذَابًا يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ الَّذِين يُضَاهُونَ خَلْقَ اللّٰهِ i. e.<br>\
[The most severely punished of mankind on the<br>\
day of resurrection will be] those who imitate by<br>\
what they make [the creation of God]; meaning<br>\
the sculptors or limners or the like. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, [or ضَاهَى بِهِ, like ضَاهَأَ به, q. v.,] He was,<br>\
or became, gentle, tender, or courteous, or he<br>\
acted, or behaved, gently, &amp;c., with him, or to<br>\

ضَهْيًا: see the next paragraph, in four places.<br>\
ضَهْيَآءُ A woman that does not menstruate: pl.<br>\
ضُهْىٌ; which necessarily implies that the former<br>\
is [as above, i. e.] with the long ا: but AA mentions ↓ ضَهْيَاةٌ and ↓ ضَهْيَاهٌ, with ة and with ه, as<br>\
having this meaning; which necessarily implies<br>\
that ضهيا is with the short ا [i. e., accord. to a<br>\
general rule, ↓ ضَهْيًا, with tenween, like ضَهْيَأٌ,<br>\
q. v. in art. ضهيأ, though (accord. to a general<br>\
rule) this should be regarded as a masc. epithet]:<br>\
(S) or ضَهْيَآءُ, and also with the short ا [app.<br>\
↓ ضَهْيًا, as above, not ضَهْيَا, or, as I rather incline<br>\
to think, ضَهْيَأٌ (which is mentioned in art. ضهيأ)<br>\
may be here meant], signify a woman that does<br>\
not menstruate nor become pregnant; (K, TA;)<br>\
so that she is as though she resembled a man:<br>\
(TA: [see 3:]) or that menstruates but does not<br>\
become pregnant: (K, TA:) or that does not<br>\
bring forth, though she menstruate: (TA:) or<br>\
whose breasts do not grow forth; (K, TA;) and<br>\
when this is the case, she does not menstruate:<br>\
or the former signifies that does not menstruate,<br>\
being pregnant. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  Land that does<br>\
not give growth to anything; as also with the<br>\
short ا [i. e. ↓ ضَهْيًا or ضَهْيَأٌ]. (K. [In the TA<br>\
this meaning is restricted, app. without reason, to<br>\
the form with the short ا.])<br>\
-A2-  Also, (S, K,) and<br>\
with the short ا [i. e. ↓ ضَهْيًا or ضَهْيَأٌ], (K,) A<br>\
species of tree (S, K) of the kind called عِضَاه, (K,)<br>\
having a بَرَمَة [q. v.] and a pod (عُلَّفَة) [which<br>\
succeeds the بَرَمَة], and many thorns. (TA. [For<br>\
further descriptions thereof, see ضَهْيَأٌ, in art.<br>\
ضهيأ.])<br>\
ضَهْيَاةٌ and ضَهْيَاهٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
ضَهِىٌّ, (S, K,) of the measure فَعِيلٌ, (S,) The<br>\
like of another [thing or person]: (S, K:) one<br>\
says, هٰذَا ضَهِىُّ هٰذَا This is the like of this: (S:)<br>\
or هُوَ ضَهِيُّكَ He is the like of thee. (K.)<br>\
