masc. when thus called; (S, Msb;) but if called<br>\
سِنٌّ, it is fem.: (Msb:) or it is properly masc.;<br>\
and if found in poetry made fem., سِنٌّ is meant<br>\
thereby: (Zj, Msb:) but As denies its being<br>\
made fem.; (Msb, TA;) and as to the saying<br>\
ascribed to Dukeyn,<br>\
فَفُقِئَتْ عَيْنٌ وَطَنَّتْ ضِرْسُ<br>\
[And an eye was put out, and a tooth, or grinder,<br>\
sounded], he says that the right reading is وَطَنَّ<br>\
الضِّرْسُ [and the tooth, or grinder, sounded], and<br>\
that he who heard these words understood them<br>\
not. (TA.) What are called أَضْرَاسُ العَقْلِ and<br>\
أَضْرَاسُ الحُلُم [The wisdom-teeth, and the teeth of<br>\
puberty] are four: they come forth after the<br>\

(IAar, TA:) or a rain little in quantity: (S, O:)<br>\
or a light rain: pl. ضُرُوسٌ: (K:) or ضُرُوسٌ مِنْ<br>\
مَطَرٍ means scattered rains: (As, TA:) or scattered showers of rain: (S, O:) and some say,<br>\
i. q. جُدُر [app. a mistranscription, probably for<br>\
خَدَرٌ, which signifies rain; or clouds, or mist,<br>\
and rain]: and [it is. said that] ضِرْسٌ signifies<br>\
also a raining cloud that has not [much] width.<br>\

cross or repugnant and averse; syn. شَرِسٌ. (K.)<br>\
You say رَجُلٌ ضَرِسٌ شَرِسٌ. (Yz, S, A, O.) [See<br>\
ضَرُوسٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  See also مُضَرَّسٌ, last sentence.<br>\
ضِرْسَةٌ Ruggedness, and roughness. (TA.)<br>\
ضُرَاسٌ Toothache. (MA.)<br>\
ضِرَاسٌ [seems to signify, properly, A disposition<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  The she-camel is in the case of the recentness of<br>\
her bringing forth, when she defends her young<br>\
one; from the epithet ضَرُوسٌ; (S, Meyd, O; but<br>\
in the S and O, هِىَ, referring to the she-camel, is<br>\
put in the place of الناقة;) and is a prov., applied<br>\
to the man whose nature is evil on the occasion of<br>\
his defending. (Meyd.) And one says, اِتَّقِ النَّاقَةَ<br>\
بِجِنِّ ضِرَاسِهَا, meaning (tropical:)  Beware thou of the she-camel in the case of the recentness of her bringing<br>\
forth, and of her evil disposition towards him who<br>\
approaches her, by reason of her attachment to<br>\
her young one. (A, TA.) [In the TA, in art. جن,<br>\
this saying is mentioned with ضِرَامِهَا in the place<br>\
of ضِرَاسِهَا: the former may perhaps be another<br>\
reading; but I rather think that it is a mistranscription for the latter. And in the present<br>\
art. in the TA, it is added that Sgh has mentioned (app. in the TS, for he has not done so in<br>\
the O,) El-Báhilee&#39;s having explained الضِّرَاسُ as<br>\
meaning سِيْمٌ لهم; and that it is likewise explained<br>\
in the T as meaning سِيْمٌ: but I know no such<br>\
word as سِيْمٌ; nor do I know any word of which<br>\
it is likely to be a mistranscription, though I have<br>\
diligently searched for such. This word سِيْمٌ has<br>\
been altered by the copyist in each instance in the<br>\
TA; so that it seems to have been indistinctly<br>\
written by the author.] ―<br>\

proved, and rendered expert, or strong, by wars,<br>\
(S, A,) and by affairs, or calamities: (A:) like<br>\
مُنَجَّذٌ from نَاجِذٌ: (A, TA:) or who has become<br>\
experienced in affairs: (AA, S:) one who has<br>\
