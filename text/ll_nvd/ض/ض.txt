ض<br>\
The fifteenth letter of the alphabet: called ضَادٌ: it<br>\
is one of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة [or vocal, i. e.<br>\
pronounced with the voice, and not with the<br>\
breath only]; (TA;) and of the letters termed<br>\
شَجْرِيَّة, (&#39;Eyn, Mgh, TA,) from الشَّجْرُ, which is<br>\
the place of the opening of the mouth: (&#39;Eyn,<br>\
Mgh, TA on the letter ج:) its place of utterance<br>\
is from the extremity of the tongue [extended so<br>\
as to reach] to the part next to the [lateral teeth<br>\
called] أَضْرَاس; and it is more usually pronounced<br>\
from the left side than from the right: the vulgar<br>\
[sometimes] pronounce it as ظَآء, making its place<br>\
of utterance to be between the extremity of the<br>\
tongue and the central incisors, which pronunciation is peculiar to a dialect, as mentioned by<br>\
Fr on the authority of El-Fadl: he says [also]<br>\
that some of the Arabs substitute it for ظَآء, saying<br>\
ضَهْر for ظَهْر; but that the doing thus, though allowable in speech, is not allowable in the reciting of the<br>\
Book of God, which follows the rule, or usage, of<br>\
the Prophet: (Msb in art. ضود:) or its place of<br>\
utterance is from the foremost part of the edge of<br>\
the tongue and the part next to the اضراس; and it<br>\
has no sister [or analogue] accord. to Sb; but<br>\
accord. to the &#39;Eyn, it is a sister of ذ and ث, and<br>\
these three letters are termed لِثَوِيَّة [or gingival],<br>\
because proceeding from the gum; the substitution<br>\
of any of these, however, for another of them,<br>\
vitiates prayers: (Mgh:) it is of the class termed<br>\
الحُرُوفُ المُسْتَعْلِيَةُ: (L in art. ضود:) and is a letter<br>\
peculiar to the Arabs, (L and K in that art.,)<br>\
accord. to the general and correct opinion; (TA<br>\
in that art.;) [whence the saying of Mohammad,<br>\
أَنَا أَفْصَحُ مَنْ نَطَقَ بِالضَّادِ I am the most chaste in<br>\
speech of those who have pronounced the letter dád;<br>\
i. e., of the Arabs, agreeably with another saying,<br>\
ascribed to him, mentioned voce بَيْدَ;] or it is<br>\
a letter rarely occurring in the language of<br>\
any other people. (L in that art.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is always<br>\
a radical letter; and is [said to be] not substituted<br>\
for another letter; (L in art. ضود;) [but it is so<br>\
substituted in some cases of إِدْغَام, as, for instance,<br>\
for the ل of the article ال, and in يَضَّرَّعُ for<br>\
يَتَضَرَّعُ, and the like; and] it is sometimes substituted for ص, as in مَضَّ الرُّمَّانَةَ for مَصَّهَا, as<br>\
Ibn-Osfoor says, and Ks mentions مَنَاضٌ for<br>\
مَنَاصٌ; (TA;) and also for ل, as Ibn-Málik says<br>\
in the Tes-heel, an instance of which is رَجُلٌ جَضْدٌ<br>\
for جَلْدٌ, mentioned by J; (MF, TA;) and<br>\
sometimes it is changed into ل, as in the instance<br>\
of اِلْطَجَعَ for اِضْطَجَعَ. (S and L &amp;c. in art. ضجع.)<br>\
-A2-  [As a numeral, it denotes Eight hundred.]<br>\
