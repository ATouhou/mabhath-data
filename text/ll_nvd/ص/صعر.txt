a mark of the people of El-Yemen, only made<br>\
upon she-camels: (Tedhkireh of Aboo-&#39;Alee:)<br>\
not upon a camel whether male or female, (K,) as<br>\
it is said to be by A&#39;Obeyd [and J]. (TA.) J<br>\
was led into error by a verse of El-Museiyab (K)<br>\
Ibn &#39;Alas; wherein he uses the phrase بِنَاجٍ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
الصَّيْعَرِيَّةُ [With a swift he-camel marked with the<br>\
صيعريّة]; (TA;) on hearing which, Tarafeh (K)<br>\
Ibn-El-&#39;Abd (TA) said, قَدِ اسْتَنْوَقَ الجَمَلُ [The<br>\
male camel has assumed the characteristic of the<br>\
female camel]. (K, TA.) El-Bedr El-Karáfee<br>\
urges that the term بَعِير, used by J, includes the<br>\
female; and that the masc. epithet [نَاجٍ] is used<br>\
[by the poet] because the male is the more honourable, being more hardy, and stronger than the<br>\
female: but this demands consideration. (TA.)<br>\
أَصْعَرُ Having a wryness, or distortion, in the<br>\
cheek, (S,) or in the face, (A, K,) or in either side<br>\
[thereof], (K,) or in the neck, (A, Msb,) by<br>\
reason of pride, (A,) with a turning of the face<br>\
on one side: (Msb:) or a camel having a disorder<br>\
by reason of which he twists his neck, (K,) and<br>\
distorts it: (TA:) sometimes the being so is<br>\
natural (S, A, Msb, K) in a man (S, Msb) and in<br>\
an ostrich; (S, A, Mgh;) and sometimes it is<br>\
accidental: (Msb:) pl. صُعْرٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It occurs<br>\
in a trad. as signifying Such as withdraws himself [from others, through pride]; syn. ذَاهِبٌ<br>\
بِنَفْسِهِ: (S, TA: [thought by Ibr D to be a<br>\
mistake for زَاهٍ بِنَفْسِهِ: but this seems to me<br>\
improbable:]) or such as turns away his face, by<br>\
reason of pride: (IAth:) and in another trad. as<br>\
signifying such as turns away from the truth, and<br>\
is faulty. (TA.)<br>\
مُصْعَرٌّ, (S,) in the K مُصْعَرٌ, said to be like مُكْرَمٌ,<br>\
but the former is the right, as is shown by the<br>\
ex. below, (TA,) applied to a night-journey to<br>\
water, Hard, or severe. (S, K.) A poet says,<br>\
وَقَدْ قَرَبْنَ قَرَبًا مُصْعَرَّا<br>\
[And they had performed a hard night-journey<br>\
to water]. (S, TA.)<br>\
مُصَعْرَرٌ [Made round: and simply, round]. A<br>\
rájiz says,<br>\
سُودٌ كَحَبِّ الفُلْفُلِ المُصَعْرَرِ<br>\
[Black, like the round grains of pepper]. (S.)<br>\
