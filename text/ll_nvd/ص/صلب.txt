-b2-  And in like manner<br>\
one says of one who roasts, or broils, or fries,<br>\

or was of the kind termed صَالِب [q. v.]. (M,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
صلّبهُ, (inf. n. تَصْلِيبٌ, TA,) He, or it,<br>\
rendered it, or him, hard, firm, rigid, stiff, tough,<br>\
strong, robust, sturdy, or hardy. (S, M, K, TA.)<br>\
El-Aashà says,<br>\
مِنْ سَرَاةِ الهِجَانِ صَلَّبَهَا العُ<br>\
ضُّ وَرِعْىُ الحِمَى وَطُولُ الحِيَالِ<br>\

of El-Himè, meaning Himè Dareeyeh, the place<br>\
of pasture of the camels of the kings, and the being<br>\
long without conceiving, (TA,) have rendered<br>\

one says, صلّب النَّبِيذَ بِحَبِّ الدَّاذِىِّ (assumed tropical:)  [He made<br>\

(AA, S, K:) and صَلَّبَتِ التَّمْرَةُ the date became<br>\

in the K to be syn. with صَلُبَ:] see 1, first sentence.<br>\
-A3-  See also 1, latter half, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\

used as a subst. properly so termed; (Mgh;) as<br>\
in a trad. where it is said of the Prophet, قَضَبَ<br>\
التَّصْلِيبَ; meaning قَطَعَ مَوْضِعَ التَّصْلِيبِ مِنْهُ [He<br>\

And a man&#39;s praying فِى تَصْلِيبِ العِمَامَةِ [with the<br>\
turban disposed cross-wise] is disapproved: he<br>\
should wind it so that one part [or fold] thereof<br>\
is above [not across] another. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اصلبت, (AA, K,) inf. n. إِصْلَابٌ, (AA, TA,)<br>\

صُلْبٌ and ↓ صَلَبٌ, (M,) A rugged, stony place:<br>\
(M, K; *) or صُلْبٌ signifies a rugged, extending<br>\
place, of the earth or ground; and ↓ صَلَبٌ, a hard<br>\
part of the earth or ground: (S:) or this last,<br>\

respect of the places of biting; meaning he is<br>\
strong, or resisting, or indomitable, of spirit;<br>\
(عَزِيزُ النَّفْسِ;) thus صُلْبُ المَعْجَمِ is expl. in the S<br>\
and K in art. عجم]: and صُلْبُ العُودِ (tropical:) [which<br>\
means the same]. (A, TA.) And صُلْبُ العَصَا and<br>\
العَصَا ↓ صَلِيبُ, applied to a tender of camels; [lit.<br>\
Hard, &amp;c., in respect of the staff;] meaning<br>\

عَلَيْهَا إِذَا مَا أَجْدَبَ النَّاسُ إِصْبَعَا<br>\
[Hard, &amp;c., having the veins of his limbs appearing: thou wilt see him to have a finger pointing<br>\
at them, i. e. his camels, because of their good<br>\
condition, when the people are afflicted with<br>\
drought]. (M, TA. But in the S, in art. صبع,<br>\
we find ضَعِيف in this verse instead of صَلِيب.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And [in like manner] هُوَ صُلْبٌ فِى دِينِهِ and ↓ صُلَّبٌ<br>\
(tropical:)  [He is hard, firm, or strong, in his religion].<br>\

(Msb, TA) and ↓ صَلَبٌ (S, M, A, K) and ↓ صَالِبٌ,<br>\
(IAth, L, K,) which last is rarely used, (IAth,<br>\
TA,) and is said to occur only in one instance, in<br>\
poetry, but another instance of it in poetry is<br>\
cited, (TA,) The back-bone; i. e. the bone extending from the كَاهِل [or base of the neck] to the<br>\
عَجْب [or rump bone]; (M, A, K;) the bone upon<br>\
which the neck is set, extending to the root of the<br>\
tail [in a beast], and in a man to the عُصْعُص [or<br>\
os coccygis]: (Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán: ”) or<br>\
a portion of the back: (S:) and any portion of<br>\
the back containing vertebræ: (S, Msb, TA:)<br>\
[and particularly the lumbar portion; the lions:]<br>\
and the back [absolutely]; as is said in an explanation of a verse of &#39;Adee Ibn-Zeyd cited in what<br>\
follows: (M, TA:) pl. [of mult.] صِلَبَةٌ and [of<br>\
pauc.] أَصْلُبٌ and أَصْلَابٌ, (M, K,) each of which<br>\
two is used in poetry in a sing. sense, as though<br>\
every part of the صُلْب were regarded as a صُلْب<br>\
in itself, and صِلْبَةٌ, (M, TA,) of which last ISd<br>\
says, [but this I do not find in the M,] I do not<br>\
think it to be of established authority, unless it be<br>\
a contraction of صِلَبَةٌ. (TA.) Lh mentions, as a<br>\
phrase of the Arabs, هٰؤُلَآءِ أَبْنَآءُ صِلَبَتِهِمْ [These are<br>\
the sons of their loins: because the sperma of the<br>\
man is held to proceed from the صُلْب of the man,<br>\
as is said in the Ksh &amp;c. in lxxxvi. 7]. (M. [See<br>\
also a similar phrase in the Kr iv. 27.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence صُلْبٌ is used as signifying The middle of<br>\
a page, as distinguished from the هَامِش (or<br>\
margin): and in like manner, of other things.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence, likewise,] صُلْبٌ signifies also حَسَبٌ<br>\
[meaning (assumed tropical:)  Rank or quality, &amp;c.]: (AA, S, M,<br>\
K:) and power, or strength. (M, K.) A poet<br>\
says, (M,) namely, &#39;Adee Ibn-Zeyd, (S, TA,)<br>\
إِجْلَ أَنَّ اللّٰهَ قَدْ فَضَّلَكُمْ<br>\
فَوْقَ مَا أَحْكِى بِصُلْبٍ وَإِزَارْ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Because God hath made you to have excellence<br>\
above what I can relate, in rank or quality, or in<br>\
power, and abstinence from unlawful things]: (S,<br>\
M, TA:) AA says that صُلْب here signifies حَسَب;<br>\
(S;) and إِزَار here signifies عَفَاف: (S, M, TA:)<br>\
but some expl. صُلْب here by both حَسَب and قُوَّة:<br>\
and some relate the latter hemistich otherwise, i. e.<br>\
فَوْقَ مَنْ أَحْكَأَ صُلْبًا بِإِزَارْ<br>\
meaning above such as binds the back with an<br>\
izár. (M, TA.) And it is said in a trad., إِنَّ<br>\
المُغَالِبَ صُلْبَ اللّٰهِ مَغْلُوبٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Verily he<br>\
who strives to overcome] the power of God [is<br>\
overcome]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also Coitus (جِمَاع): because the sperma [of the man] issues from the<br>\
part so called. (TA.)<br>\
صَلَبٌ, and its pl. أَصْلَابٌ: see صُلْبٌ, former<br>\
half, in six places:<br>\
-A2-  and see also صَلِيبٌ, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
صُلَبٌ A certain bird, (O, K,) resembling the<br>\
صَقْر [or hawk], but which does not prey, and<br>\
which is vehement, or loud, in its cry. (O.)<br>\
صُلُبٌ: see صُلْبٌ, near the middle.<br>\
صَلِيبٌ: see صُلْبٌ, former half, in five places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] مَآءٌ صَلِيبٌ (tropical:)  Water upon which cattle<br>\
grow fat and strong and hard. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
عَرَبِىٌّ صَلِيبٌ (tropical:)  An Arabian of pure race: (A,<br>\
Mgh, TA:) and اِمْرَأَةٌ صَلِيبَةٌ (tropical:)  A woman of noble,<br>\
or generous, origin. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Grease,<br>\
or oily matter, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) of bones; (S,<br>\
M, * Msb;) and so ↓ صَلَبٌ; (M, K;) which latter<br>\
signifies also ichor, or watery humour, mixed<br>\
with blood, that flows from the dead: (M:) pl.<br>\
[of the former accord. to analogy, and perhaps<br>\
of the latter also,] صُلُبٌ. (K.) Hence, in a<br>\
trad., the phrase أَصْحَابُ الصُّلُبِ [in the CK<br>\
↓ الصَّلَبِ] Those who collect bones, (K, TA,) when<br>\
the flesh has been stripped off from them, and<br>\
cook them with water, (TA,) and extract their<br>\
grease, or oily matter, and use it as a seasoning.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also [A cross;] a certain thing<br>\
pertaining to the Christians, (Lth, S, M, Msb,<br>\
K,) which they take as an object to which to<br>\
direct the face in prayer: (Lth, TA:) pl. [of mult.]<br>\
صُلْبَانٌ (S, M, A, Msb) and صُلُبٌ (Lth, S, M)<br>\
and [of pauc.] أَصْلُبٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And The<br>\
figure of a cross upon a garment &amp;c.: see مُصَلَّبٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And A certain brand, or mark made with a<br>\
hot iron, upon camels; (M, K;) which, as Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Alee says in the “ Tedhkireh,” is sometimes<br>\
large and sometimes small, and may be upon the<br>\
cheeks, and the neck, and the thighs: (M, TA:)<br>\
or, as some say, it is upon the temple; and as<br>\
some say, upon the neck; being two lines, one<br>\
upon [or across] the other. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And i. q.<br>\
عَلَمٌ [as meaning A banner, or standard; properly, in the form of a cross]: (O, K:) En-Nábighah Edh-Dhubyánee is said to have thus<br>\
called the عَلَم because there was upon it a صَلِيب<br>\
[i. e. a cross]; for he was a Christian. (O.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
[And hence, as Freytag says, (referring to the<br>\
“ Historia Halebi ” and “ Locman. Fabul. ” p.<br>\
?? 1. 5. 8,) (assumed tropical:)  An army of ten thousand soldiers.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And الصَّلِيبُ is the name of The four stars<br>\
behind النَّسْرُ الطَّائِرُ [which is the asterism consisting of the three principal stars of Aquila;<br>\
whence it seems to be the four principal stars<br>\
of Delphinus]: inconsiderately said by J to be<br>\
behind النَّسْرُ الوَاقِعُ [which is<br>\
α Lyræ]. (L, K,<br>\
and so in the margin of some copies of the S,)<br>\
[And Freytag says, (referring to Ideler Unters.<br>\
p. 35,) that الصليب الواقع is the name of (assumed tropical:)  Stars<br>\
in the head of Draco.] ―<br>\

صَلِيبَةُ الرَّجُلِ He who was, or those who were,<br>\
in the loins (صُلْب) of the father [or ancestor] of<br>\
the man: hence the family of the Prophet, who<br>\

the former of which is the more chaste: and one<br>\
seldom or never makes one of the two nouns to<br>\

accord. to Fr, they said حُمَّى صَالِبٌ and حُمَّى<br>\
