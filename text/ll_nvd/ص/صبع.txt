صَبَعَ بِهِ, aor.<br>\
صَبَعَ, (AZ, S, K,) inf. n. صَبْعٌ,<br>\
(AZ, S,) He pointed at him, or towards him,<br>\
with his finger, (بِإِصْبَعِهِ,) disparagingly: (AZ, S,<br>\
K:) or, as some say, he meant some evil thing to<br>\
him when he (the latter) was inadvertent, not<br>\
knowing. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And صَبَعَ فُلَانًا عَلَى فُلَانٍ<br>\
He directed such a one to such a one by pointing,<br>\
or indication: (S, K:) because, when one directs<br>\
a man to a way, or road, or to a thing that is<br>\
latent, or obscure, he points towards it with the<br>\
finger. (TA.) One says, مَا صَبَعَكَ عَلَيْنَا What<br>\
directed thee to us? (TA.) And صَبَعَ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ<br>\
He directed others to the people, or party. (TA.)<br>\
Of one who magnifies himself, or acts proudly,<br>\
in his government, or administration, one says,<br>\
صَبَعَهُ الشَّيْطَانُ (assumed tropical:)  [app. meaning The Devil has<br>\
directed him]: and أَدْرَكَتْهُ أَصَابِعُ الشَّيْطَانِ [The<br>\
fingers of the Devil have reached him]. (TA.<br>\
[See the pass. part. n. below.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And one says,<br>\
قُرِّبَ إِلَيْهِ طَعَامٌ فَمَا صَبَعَ فِيهِ i. e. [Food was presented, or offered, to him, or was placed, or put,<br>\
before him, and] he did not put his finger into it.<br>\

الدَّجَاجَةَ, (O, K,) inf. n. as above. (TA,) He<br>\

-b5-  And صَبَعَ<br>\
الإِنَآءَ He put his finger upon the vessel so that<br>\
what was in another vessel flowed upon it [into<br>\
the former vessel]: (A&#39;Obeyd, S, O, K:) or, as<br>\
some say, he put together his two fingers, [or two<br>\
of his fingers,] then discharged, or let flow, what<br>\
was in the vessel, of wine, or beverage, into a<br>\
thing with a narrow head [or mouth]: or, accord.<br>\
to Az, he discharged, or let flow, what was in the<br>\
vessel, of wine, or beverage, between the extremities of [either of] his two thumbs and fore<br>\
fingers, in order that it might not become scattered, and pour forth copiously. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And<br>\
صَبَعَهُ, inf. n. as above, He hit, or hurt, his finger.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  صَبَعَ عَلَى القَوْمِ, inf. n. as above, meaning He came forth upon the people, or party, is<br>\
said to be originally صَبَأَ, with ء. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اصبع, followed by عَلَى, is said by Freytag,<br>\
as on the authority of Meyd, to signify He (a<br>\
pastor) fed and managed well his cattle: but this<br>\
is perhaps taken from a mistranscription of the<br>\
saying, mentioned by Meyd, لِلرَّاعِى عَلَى مَاشِيَتَهِ<br>\
إِصْبَعٌ, q. v. infrà.]<br>\

vowelled, and the ب likewise (Msb, K) with<br>\
every one of the vowellings of the ء, (K,) and<br>\
↓ أُصْبُوعٌ also, (Msb, K,) of all which forms the<br>\
first is the [only] one commonly known and the<br>\
one approved by persons of chaste speech, (Msb,)<br>\

authority of Yoo, (TA,) A finger: and a toe:<br>\

-b2-  One<br>\
says, بِهِمْ تُثْنَى الأَصَابِعُ [With the mention of them<br>\
the fingers are bent]; meaning that they are<br>\
reckoned as the best, [or among the best,] for the<br>\
best are not many. (M, on a verse cited in the<br>\
first paragraph of art. ثنى.) [See also two similar<br>\
exs. in the first paragraph of art. حنو and حنى.]<br>\

has a finger pointing at his cattle, or camels or<br>\
sheep or goats]; meaning, [has upon his cattle]<br>\
an impress of a good state or condition; (S, K, *<br>\
TA;) i. e. they are pointed at with the fingers<br>\
because of their goodliness and fatness and good<br>\
tending. (TA.) [See also a verse cited voce<br>\
صُلْبٌ.] And similar to this saying is the prov.,<br>\
عَلَيْهِ مِنَ اللّٰهِ تَعَالَى إِصْبَعٌ حَسَنٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Upon<br>\
him is, from God, (acknowledged be his absolute<br>\
supremacy,)] an impress of a good state or condition. (Meyd.) And one says also, إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ<br>\
الإِصْبَعِ فِى مَالِهِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Verily he is good in<br>\

-b5-  And<br>\
لَهُ إِصْبَعٌ فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ (tropical:)  [He has a finger in this<br>\
affair]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  The Prophet said قَلْبُ المُؤْمِنِ<br>\
بَيْنَ إِصْبَعَيْنِ مِنْ أَصَابِعِ اللّٰهِ يُقَلِّبُهُ كَيْفَ شَآءَ<br>\
(tropical:)  [The heart of the believer is between two of the<br>\
fingers of God: He turneth it about as He<br>\
pleaseth]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And a man says, in respect of<br>\
a difficult affair, when he has been made to have<br>\
recourse to a strong man, able to bear his burden,<br>\
إِنَّهُ يَأْتِى عَلَيْهِ بِإِصْبِعٍ وَاحِدَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily he will make<br>\
an end of it with one finger]: and إِنَّهُ يَكْفِيهِ<br>\
بِصُغْرَى أَصَابِعِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily the smallest of his fingers<br>\
will suffice him for its accomplishment; the ب<br>\
thus prefixed to the agent being redundant, as in<br>\
كَفَى بِاللّٰهِ شَهِيدًا and many other instances]. (O.)<br>\
―<br>\

(assumed tropical:) A species of grapes, (AHn, O, K,) black, (AHn,<br>\
O,) long, like the acorn, likened to the dyed<br>\
fingers of virgins; (AHn, O, K; *) the bunch<br>\
thereof is about a cubit [in length], compact [so I<br>\
render مُتَدَاخِس, supposing it to be similar to<br>\
دخيس applied to herbage &amp;c.,] in the grapes; its<br>\

variegated with yellowness and whiteness, hard,<br>\
and having a little sweetness; and there is a<br>\
species thereof yellow, with a dust-colour, but<br>\
without whiteness: (O, TA:) so says Ibn-Jezleh:<br>\
(TA:) it is beneficial as a remedy for madness, or<br>\
diabolical possession, and for poisons, (K, TA,)<br>\
and the sting, or bite, of venomous, or noxious,<br>\
reptiles, or the like, and it acts as a dissolvent<br>\
of thick excrescences. (TA.) ―<br>\
