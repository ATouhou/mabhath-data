-b6-  And<br>\
صَدَعَ بِالحَقِّ (tropical:)  He spoke the truth openly, or aloud,<br>\

being held by Fr, who thus explains the phrase,<br>\
to occupy the place of an inf. n., namely, الأَمْر:<br>\
(TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  utter thou openly, or aloud, (O, K,<br>\
TA,) that with which thou art charged, meaning,<br>\
accord. to Ibn-Mujáhid, (TA,) the Kur-án: (O,<br>\

صَدَّعَ see 1, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  [Freytag adds two<br>\
other explanations of صدّع: namely, “Immisit,”<br>\
followed by an accus. and فى; taken by inference<br>\
from the Ham p. 196, l. 12 from the bottom: and<br>\
“ Rupit, perdidit; ” from Reiske&#39;s additions to<br>\
Golius: but both of these require consideration.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [صدّعهُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  It affected him with<br>\
headache; as though it made his head to split.]<br>\

part. n. ↓ مَصْدُوعٌ, is allowable in poetry. (O, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تصدّع, of which اِصَّدَّعَ is a var.: (O, K:)<br>\

-b2-  Also It became separated,<br>\

meaning it became cloven &amp;c., or it clave &amp;c.,<br>\

hard thing, (Lth, O, K, TA,) such as a glass<br>\
vessel, and a wall, and the like of these: pl.<br>\
صُدُوعٌ. (TA.) Hassán says, satirizing El-Hárith<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Owf El-Murree,<br>\
وَأَمَانَةُ المُرِّىِّ حَيْثُ لَقِيتَهُ<br>\
مِثْلُ الزُّجَاجَةِ صَدْعُهَا لَمْ يُجْبَرِ<br>\
[And the fidelity of the Murree, where (meaning<br>\
wherever) thou meetest him, is like the glass<br>\
vessel, of which the crack is not repaired]. (O,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A part, or portion, separated, of<br>\
a thing, (O, K, TA,) of sheep or goats, and the<br>\
like: (TA:) an inf. n. used as a subst. [properly<br>\
thus termed]: (O, K, TA:) like خَلْقٌ in the<br>\

-b3-  And The<br>\
plants of the earth; (K;) because they cleave it:<br>\
(TA:) [i. e.] the plants from over which the<br>\
earth cleaves: so in the phrase وَالأَرْضِ ذَاتِ الصَّدْعِ,<br>\
in the Kur lxxxvi. 12: (Bd:) or this phrase<br>\
means And the earth which is cloven by the<br>\
plants (Th, Bd, TA) and by the springs. (Bd.)<br>\
-A2-  And i. q. إِلْبٌ: (TA:) you say, النَّاسُ عَلَيْهِمْ<br>\
صَدْعٌ وَاحِد, (K, TA,) and إِلْبٌ وَاحِدٌ [or أَلْبٌ<br>\
وَاحِدٌ], (TA,) The people are one company combined in hostility against them: (K, TA:) and in<br>\
like manner وَعْلٌ واحد and ضِلَعٌ واحد: so says<br>\
AZ. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And A man light of flesh; and so<br>\
↓ صَدَعٌ, (S, K,) sometimes: (S:) or of middling<br>\
stature, light of flesh: (Ks, TA:) like the mountain-goat thus termed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also صَدَعٌ.<br>\
صِدْعٌ The half of a thing that is cloven, or<br>\
split, or slit, in halves. (K, * TA. [See also<br>\
صِدْعَةٌ.]) You say, صَدَعَ الشَّىْءَ صِدْعَيْنِ He<br>\
clave, or split, or slit, the thing in halves. (TA.)<br>\

(S,) applied to a mountain-goat, and a gazelle,<br>\
and an ass, [app. a wild ass,] (S, K,) and a camel,<br>\
(K,) Of a middling size, neither great nor small,<br>\
but between the two: (S:) or youthful and strong:<br>\
[see also صَدِيعٌ:] or [in the CK “ and ”] the<br>\
former word signifies a thing of any sort between<br>\
two things; between tall and short, and youthful<br>\
and advanced in age, and fat and lean, and great<br>\
and small. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  For the former word as applied to a man: see صَدْعٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, thus applied<br>\
Penetrating, sharp, or effective, in his affair.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [It is said that] صَدَعٌ signifies also The<br>\
صَدَأ [i. e. rust] of iron. (K.) [But this seems to<br>\
be a mistake, which has arisen from what here<br>\
follows.] It is said that [a certain person called]<br>\
El-Uskuff [which generally means “ the bishop ”],<br>\
being asked by &#39;Omar respecting the Khaleefehs, designated [him who was afterwards]<br>\
the fourth of them [&#39;Alee] as صَدَعٌ مِنْ حَدِيدٍ,<br>\
meaning [lit.] thereby A mountain-goat of iron;<br>\
using it as a hyperbolical appellation to denote<br>\
his might and courage and endurance and hardness: or the phrase, as some relate it, is صَدَأٌ حَديدٌ<br>\
[which may be rendered, “light or active in<br>\
body ” (a meaning assigned to صَدَأٌ and صَدَعٌ,<br>\
the latter of which is said to be in this sense the<br>\
original), and “ sharp ”]; or صَدَأُ حَدِيدٍ [i. e.<br>\
“ rust of iron,” app. alluding to his frequent and<br>\
long-continued wearing of mail and bearing of<br>\
weapons]; which last is thought by As to be<br>\
most probably correct. (O, * TA.)<br>\
صِدْعَةٌ The half of a thing that is cloven,<br>\
split, or slit, in halves; as also ↓ صَدِيعٌ. (K.<br>\
[See also صِدْعٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A [herd such as is<br>\
termed] صِرْمَة of camels; (S, O, K;) and so<br>\
↓ صَدِيعٌ: (S, O, K: *) or, accord. to AZ, a herd<br>\
of camels amounting to sixty. (O, TA.) And<br>\
A separate flock, or herd, of sheep or goats; as<br>\
also ↓ صَدِيعٌ: (S, O, K:) or, as some say, of<br>\
these also, amounting to sixty: and it is said to<br>\
signify also a herd of gazelles: (TA:) and ↓ صَدِيعٌ<br>\
signifies also a herd of oxen [probably meaning<br>\
wild oxen]. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  One says also, عَلَيْهِ<br>\
صِدْعَةٌ مِنْ مَالٍ i. e. [On him lies a debt of] a<br>\
small amount of property. (TA.)<br>\

says, بَيْنَهُمْ صَدَعَاتٌ فِى الرَّأْىِ وَالهَوَى (tropical:)  Between<br>\
them is division [in opinion and affection; or<br>\
rather between them are divisions &amp;c.]. (O, K,<br>\
TA.) And أَصْلِحُوا مَا فِيكُمْ مِنَ الصَّدَعَاتِ (tropical:)  [Repair ye the divisions that are among you;] i. e.<br>\
become ye in a state of unity. (O, TA.) And<br>\
إِنَّهُمْ عَلَى مَا فِيهِمْ مِنَ الصَّدَعَاتِ أَلِبَّآءُ كِرَامٌ (tropical:)  [Verily<br>\
they, notwithstanding the divisions that are among<br>\
them, are intelligent and generous]. (TA.) [It<br>\
is stated in the TA, among the additions to the<br>\
K in this art., that one says also, إِنَّهُمْ عَلَى مَا تَرَى<br>\
لَكِرَامٌ ↓ مِنْ صَدَاعَتِهِمْ app. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Verily<br>\
they, notwithstanding what thou seest of their<br>\
disunion, are generous: but I think it most<br>\
probable that صَدَاعَتِهِمْ is a mistranscription for<br>\
صَدَعَاتِهِمْ.]<br>\
-A2-  [Reiske, as stated by Freytag,<br>\
explains it as signifying also Camels going<br>\
swiftly.]<br>\
صُدَاعٌ (assumed tropical:)  Headache: (S, O, Msb, K:) Er-Rághib<br>\
says that it is like a splitting in the head by reason<br>\
of pain; and is a metaphorical term. (TA.)<br>\
صَدِيعٌ Either half of a garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth, (O, K,) that is slit in halves: (O:) and a<br>\
thing [شَىْءٌ accord. to the copies of the K, but I<br>\
think that the right reading is شَىْءٍ i. e. “ of a<br>\
thing,”] that is cloven, or split, or slit, in halves:<br>\
pl. صُدُعٌ. (K.) See also صِدْعَةٌ, first sentence.<br>\
It is also said to signify A [garment of the kind<br>\
called] رِدَآء, that is slit in halves. (TA.) And A<br>\

rends at her bosom so that the white one appears:<br>\
so says Kásim Ibn-Thábit. (TA.) And A garment that is worn beneath the coat of mail. (O,<br>\
K.) And A shirt [of a middling size] between<br>\
two shirts, neither large nor small. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also صِدْعَةٌ, second and third sentences, in<br>\
three places. ―<br>\
-b3-  Accord. to Ibn-&#39;Abbád, (O,)<br>\
applied to a mountain-goat, it signifies Youthful:<br>\
and (some say, O) of middling size; syn. مَرْبُوعُ<br>\
الخَلْقِ; (O, K, TA;) i. e. between two [in size];<br>\
like صَدَعٌ [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Daybreak:<br>\
(S, O, K:) because it cleaves the night. (O.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
And Fresh milk which is put in a place, and<br>\
becomes cool, and overspread by a thin skin: (O,<br>\
K:) so called because you skim off (تَصْدَعُ, lit.<br>\
“ cleave,”) that thin skin from the clear milk.<br>\
(O.)<br>\

may be correct,]) and a mountain, (K, TA, [in<br>\
the O, حَبْلٌ is put for جَبَلٌ,]) (assumed tropical:)  Extending far<br>\
along the earth. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, applied<br>\
to the daybreak, (assumed tropical:)  Shining, or bright; syn. مُشْرِقٌ.<br>\
(IDrd, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  One who decides, or<br>\

بِظَهْرِ الصَّفَا الصَّلْدِ الشُّقُوقُ الصَّوَادِعُ<br>\
[i. e. And when separation from her appeared,<br>\
like as appear the cleaving cracks in the surface<br>\
of the hard and smooth rock]: it may be that<br>\
↓ صَدَعَ is syn. with تَصَدَّعَ in some dial. [and that<br>\
صَوَادِع is pl. of its part. n.]: or this may be an<br>\
instance of a possessive epithet, meaning having a<br>\
cleaving. (TA.)<br>\
هُوَ أَصْدَعُهُمْ بِالصَّوَابِ فِى أَسْرَعِ جَوَابٍ (assumed tropical:)  [app.<br>\
