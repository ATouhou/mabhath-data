-A2-  [Accord. to Freytag,<br>\
اصفر signifies also It (a house) was, or became,<br>\

[thus in an old and very excellent copy of the S,<br>\
in another copy of which I find, as in Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Lex., ↓ صُفْرَةٍ,]) and ↓ صِفْرِهِ, (TA,) [app. means<br>\
He is in that state in which he requires to be<br>\
rubbed with saffron; for it] is said of him who is<br>\
affected by madness, when he is in the days in<br>\
which his reason fails; because they used to rub<br>\

the first three is used alike as masc. and fem. and<br>\
sing. [and dual] and pl.: (M:) [and so, app., is<br>\
the last but one:] and each has also for its pl.<br>\
أَصْفَارٌ. (M, K.) One says بَيْتٌ صِفْرٌ مِنَ المَتَاعِ<br>\
A house, or tent, or chamber, empty, or void, of<br>\
furniture and utensils. (S.) And [applying the<br>\
pl. form of the epithet to a sing. subst.,] إِنَآءٌ أَصْفَارٌ<br>\
An empty vessel; (M, K;) like as one says<br>\
بُرْمَةٌ أَعْشَارٌ; on the authority of IAar: (M:) and<br>\
[applying the sing form of the epithet to a pl.<br>\
subst.,] آنِيَةٌ صِفْرٌ empty vessels. (M, K.) And<br>\
رَجُلٌ صِفْرُ اليَدَيْنِ A man empty-handed. (S,<br>\
Msb.) And صِفْرٌ مِنَ الخَيْرِ (assumed tropical:)  Void of good. (TA.)<br>\
And it is said, in a trad., of Umm-Zara, that she<br>\
was صِفْرٌ رِدَاؤُهَا meaning (assumed tropical:)  Lank in her belly; as<br>\
though her رداء, which is a garment that falls<br>\
upon the belly and there ends, were empty.<br>\
(TA.) And هُوَ صِفْرٌ صِحْرٌ It is [utterly] empty;<br>\
صحر being an imitative sequent. (Kh, Ham p.<br>\
354.) ―<br>\
-b2-  صِفْرٌ in arithmetical notation, in the<br>\
Indian method, is A circle [or the character ه,<br>\
denoting nought, or zero; whence our term<br>\
“ cipher: ” when nought is thus denoted, five is<br>\
denoted by a character resembling our B: but<br>\
more commonly, in the present day, nought is<br>\
denoted by a round dot; and five, by ه]. (L,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also صُفْرٌ, in two places.<br>\
صَفَرٌ [an inf. n. of صَفِرَ, q. v.: ―<br>\
-b2-  and hence,]<br>\
Hunger: and ↓ صَفْرَةٌ [the inf. n. un.] a hungering<br>\
once. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A certain disease in the<br>\
belly, which renders the face yellow: (M, K:) or<br>\
a collecting of water in the belly. (Kt.) [See<br>\
also صُفَارٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A kind of serpent, (S, M, K,)<br>\
in the belly, (S, K,) which sticks to the ribs, and<br>\
bites them, (M, K,) or, as the Arabs assert, which<br>\
bites a man when he is hungry, its bite occasioning<br>\
the stinging which a man feels when he is hungry:<br>\
(S:) used alike as sing. and pl.; or one is termed<br>\
صَفَرَةٌ: (M:) and it is said to be what is meant by<br>\
the word in a trad., in which it is disacknowledged: (S, TA:) or a certain reptile (دَابَّة) which<br>\
bites the ribs and their cartilages: (M, K:) or a<br>\
certain serpent in the belly, which attacks beasts<br>\
and men, and which, accord. to the Arabs [of the<br>\
time of Ignorance], passes from one to another<br>\
more than the mange or scab; (Ru-beh:) the<br>\
Prophet, however, denied its doing so: it is said<br>\
also that it oppresses and hurts a man when he is<br>\
hungry: (A&#39;Obeyd:) this is the explanation approved by Az: (TA:) or, as also ↓ صُفَارٌ, worms<br>\
in the belly, (M, K, TA,) and in the cartilages of<br>\
the ribs, which cause a man to become very<br>\
yellow, and sometimes kill him. (TA.) You say,<br>\
عَضَّ عَلَى شُرْسُوفِهِ الصَّفَرُ, meaning, (tropical:)  He was<br>\
hungry. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  Accord. to some, (M,) in the<br>\
trad. above referred to, صَفَرٌ signifies The postponing of [the month] El-Moharram, transferring it to Safar: (A&#39;Obeyd, M, K:) [see نَسِىْءٌ:]<br>\
or it there means the disease called by this name,<br>\
because they asserted it to be transitive. (K.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
Also The intellect, or understanding; or the<br>\
heart, or mind; syn. رُوعٌ: (M, K: [in the CK<br>\
رَوْع:]) the inmost part (لُبّ) of the heart. (M,<br>\
K.) Hence the saying, (TA,) لَا يَلْتَاطُ هٰذَا بِصَفَرِى<br>\
This will not adhere to me, [or to my mind,] nor<br>\
will my soul accept it: (S, TA:) said of that<br>\
which one does not love. (A.)<br>\
-A4-  Also A contract, compact, or covenant: or suretiship, or<br>\
responsibility: syn. عَقْدٌ. (M, L, K. [In some<br>\
copies of the K, فقد.])<br>\
-A5-  Also (S, M, Msb, K)<br>\
and sometimes [صَفَرُ,] imperfectly decl., (K,) but<br>\
all make it perfectly decl. except AO, who makes<br>\
it imperfectly decl. because it is determinate [or a<br>\
proper name] and similar in meaning to سَاعَةٌ,<br>\
which is fem., meaning that all nouns signifying<br>\
times are سَاعَات, (Th, M,) and, accord. to some,<br>\
الصَّفَرُ, (Msb,) [The second month of the Arabian<br>\
calendar;] the month that is [the next] after ElMoharram (المُحَرَّمُ): (S, M, K:) so called<br>\
because in it they used to procure their provision<br>\
of corn from the places [in which it was collected,<br>\
their granaries having then become empty (صِفْر);<br>\
agreeably with the opinion of my learned friend<br>\
Mons. Fulgence Fresnel, that it was so called<br>\
from the scarcity of provisions in the season in<br>\
which it fell when it was first named; for it then<br>\
fell in winter: see the latter of the two tables in<br>\
p. 1254; and see also نَسِىْءٌ]: or because Mekkeh<br>\
was then empty, its people having gone forth to<br>\
travel: or, accord. to Ru-beh, because the Arabs<br>\
in it made predatory expeditions, and left those<br>\
whom they met empty: (M:) or because they<br>\
then made predatory expeditions, and left the<br>\
houses of the people empty: (Msb in art. جمد:)<br>\
pl. أَصْفَارٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) and, as some say,<br>\
صَفَرَاتٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الصَّفَرَانِ The two months of<br>\
El-Moharram and Safar; (M;) two months of<br>\
the year, whereof one was called by the Muslims<br>\

(Msb,) found in animals and in some other things,<br>\

of Suheyl [or Canopus, which, in Central Arabia,<br>\
at the commencement of the era of the Flight,<br>\
was about the 4th of August, O. S.; here erroneously said in the M to be in the beginning of<br>\
winter]: (M, K:) or ↓ the latter word signifies<br>\
[as above, and also the period itself above mentioned: or] the period from the rising of Suheyl<br>\
to the setting of الذِّرَاع [the Seventh Mansion of<br>\
the Moon, which, in the part and age above<br>\
mentioned, was about the 3rd of January, O. S.],<br>\
when the cold is intense; and then breeding is<br>\
approved: (M:) or the period from the rising of<br>\
Suheyl to the rising of السِّمَاك [the Fourteenth<br>\
Mansion of the Moon, which, in the part and<br>\
age above mentioned, was about the 4th of<br>\

varying, or alternating, heat and cold, called<br>\
المُعْتَدِلَاتُ: (AZ:) the first increase [of sheep and<br>\
goats] is the صَقَعِىّ, which is when the sun smites<br>\
(تَصْقَعُ) the heads of the young ones; and some of<br>\
the Arabs call it the شَمْسِىّ, and the قَيْظِىّ: then<br>\
is the صَفَرِىّ, after the صَقَعِىّ; and that is when<br>\
the fruit of the palm-tree is cut off: then, the<br>\
شَتَوِىّ, which is in the [season called] رَبِيع: then,<br>\
the دَفَئِىّ, which is when the sun becomes warm:<br>\
then, the صَيفِىّ: then, the قَيْظِىّ: then, the<br>\
خَرَفِىّ, in the end of the [season called] قَيْظ:<br>\
(Aboo-Nasr:) or صَفَرِيَّةٌ signifies, (M, K,) and so<br>\
صَفَرِىٌّ, (K,) the [period of the] departure of the<br>\
heat and the coming of the cold: (AHn, M, K:)<br>\
or the period between the departure of the summer<br>\

or the first of the seasons; [app. meaning the<br>\
autumnal season, called الخَرِيف, which was the<br>\
first of the four, and of the six, seasons; or perhaps the first of the seasons of rain, commonly<br>\
called الوَسْمِىّ;] and it may be a month: (AHn,<br>\
