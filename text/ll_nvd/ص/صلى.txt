صَلَاهُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) aor. يَصْلِيهِ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) inf. n. صَلْىٌ, (S, M, K,) He roasted,<br>\
broiled, or fried, it, namely, flesh-meat, (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K,) &amp;c.; (S;) and صَلَاهُ فِى النَّارِ and عَلَى<br>\
النَّارِ signify the same; and also he burned it. (TA.)<br>\
And (so in the M, but in the K “ or ”) صَلَاهُ (M, K)<br>\
فِى النَّارِ (M) He threw it into the fire to be burned;<br>\
as also ↓ اصلاهُ; and ↓ صلّاهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَصْلِيَةٌ;<br>\
(TA;) namely, flesh-meat. (M, K. [But see the<br>\
next sentence.]) And صَلَاهُ النَّارَ and فِى النَّارِ and<br>\
عَلَى النَّارِ, (M, K,) inf. n. صَلْىٌ and صُلِىٌّ and<br>\
صِلِىٌّ; (M;) and النَّارَ ↓ اصلاهُ, and النَّارَ ↓ صلّاهُ;<br>\
He made him to enter into the fire, and to remain,<br>\
stay, dwell, or abide, therein: (M, K:) and<br>\
فُلَانٌ النَّارَ ↓ صُلِّىَ [Such as one was made to enter<br>\
into the fire, &amp;c.]: (M:) [or] you say, صَلَيْتُ<br>\
الرَّجُلَ نَارًا, meaning I made the man to enter fire<br>\
and to be burned: and ↓ أَصْلَيْتُهُ, with ا, when you<br>\
mean I threw him, or cast him, into the fire, as<br>\
though intending burning [him]; as also ↓ صَلَّيْتُهُ,<br>\
inf. n. تَصْلِيَةٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And صَلَيْتُ فُلَانًا, (T, TA,)<br>\
or لِفُلَانٍ, (S, TA,) (tropical:)  I laboured in a case, or an<br>\
affair, desiring to calumniate, or slander, such a<br>\
one therein, and to cause him to fall into destruction: (T, S, TA:) or صَلَيْتُهُ and صَلَيْتُ لَهُ both<br>\
signify I calumniated, or slandered, him, and<br>\
caused him to fall into destruction, (M, TA,) in consequence thereof: (M:) or, accord. to the K, صَلَى<br>\
فُلَانًا, of which the inf. n. is صَلْىٌ, signifies he<br>\
soothed, coaxed, wheedled, or cajoled, such a one:<br>\
or deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or<br>\
outwitted, him: which meanings are not in any<br>\
of the three lexicons above mentioned: accord. to<br>\
the A, صَلَيْتُ بِفُلَانٍ [probably a mistranscription<br>\
for لِفُلَانٍ] means (tropical:)  I framed a stratagem, or plot,<br>\
to cause such a one to fall; there said to be tropical. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  صَلَى يَدَهُ بِالنَّارِ [said in the TA<br>\
to be a mistake]: see 2.<br>\
-A2-  صَلِىَ النَّارَ, (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K,) and بِالنَّارِ, (M, Msb, K,) aor. يَصْلَى, (S, Msb, *<br>\
K, *) inf. n. صَلًى, (Msb,) or صُلِىٌّ, (S, K, [صَلْيًا<br>\
in the CK being a mistranscription for صُلِيًّا,])<br>\
or both, (M,) and صِلِىٌّ and صِلَآءٌ, (M, K,) and<br>\
accord. to the K صَلَآءٌ, but this is a mistake for<br>\
صَلًى, (TA,) He was, or became, burned [by the<br>\
fire]: (S:) or he endured, or suffered, the heat of<br>\
the fire; as also النَّارَ ↓ تصلّى: (M, K:) or he felt<br>\
the heat of the fire: (Msb:) and one says ↓ تصلّى<br>\
حَرَّ النَّارِ and ↓ اصطلاهُ [in this last sense or in the<br>\
sense next preceding]: (Ham p. 792:) and صَلِىَ<br>\
النَّارَ he entered into the fire: (TA in art. بله: see<br>\
an ex. voce بَلْهَ:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib, صَلِىَ<br>\
بِالنَّارِ means he was tried (بُلِىَ) by fire, or by the<br>\
fire; and so بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  [by such a thing, as though<br>\
by fire]. (TA.) [In the Kur, in which are many<br>\
exs. of it, (iv. 11, xiv. 34, xvii. 19, &amp;c.,) it is always<br>\
trans. by itself, without بِ.] And صَلِىَ بِالأَمْرِ, (S,<br>\
M, *) and بِالحَرْبِ; (S;) and الأَمْرَ ↓ تصلّى, and<br>\
الحَرْبَ; (M;) He endured, or suffered, the heat,<br>\
and severity, or vehemence, of the affair, or case,<br>\
and of the war, or fight: (S, M:) Aboo-Zubeyd<br>\
says,<br>\
حَرَّ حَرْبِهِمُ ↓ فَقَدْ تَصَلَّيْتُ<br>\
المَقْرُورُ مِنْ قَرَسِ ↓ كَمَا تَصَلَّى<br>\
[And I have suffered the heat and vehemence of<br>\
their war, like as he who is affected with cold<br>\
suffers in consequence of coldest and most abundant hoar-frost]. (M.)<br>\
-A3-  [It is said that] صَلِىَ<br>\
الرَّجُلُ signifies also لَزِمَ [i. e. The man kept to, or<br>\
clave to, a thing]; and so ↓ اصطلى: whence Zj<br>\
holds صَلَاةٌ [expl. in art. صلو] to be derived;<br>\
because it is a keeping, or cleaving, to that which<br>\
God has appointed: and hence also, [it is said,]<br>\
فِى النَّارِ ↓ مَنْ يُصَلَّى, i. e. يلزم [app. يُلْزَمُ, meaning<br>\
مَنْ يُلْزَمُ النَّارَ He who is made to keep, or cleave,<br>\
to the fire; nearly agreeing with صَلَّاهُ النَّارَ as<br>\
expl. above from the M and K]. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  And<br>\
صَلَيْتُ الظَّهْرَ means I struck, or beat, that part<br>\
of the back which is called صَلًا: or I hit that<br>\
part: but this is extr.; for by rule it should be<br>\
صَلَوْتُهُ, like as Hudheyl say. (M. [See 1 in art.<br>\
صلو.])<br>\
2<br>\
صَلَّىَ see 1, second sentence; and third sentence<br>\
in three places; and last sentence but one. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
One says also, صلّى يَدَهُ بِالنَّارِ, (M, TA,) accord.<br>\
to the K ↓ صَلَى, [without teshdeed,] but this is<br>\
wrong, as is shown by a verse cited in the M,<br>\
(TA,) He warmed his hand with the fire. (M,<br>\
K, TA.) [And it is said in the TA that صلا<br>\
ظَهْرَهُ بالنهر means أَدْفَأَهُ: but I think that the right<br>\
reading is صلّى ظَهْرَهُ بِالنَّمِرَةِ, i. e. He warmed his<br>\
back with the woollen garment called نَمِرَة.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And صَلَّيْتُ العَصَا بِالنَّارِ I made the staff supple,<br>\
and straightened it, by means of fire: (S:) or<br>\
صلّى العَصَا عَلَى النَّارِ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَصْلِيَةٌ;<br>\
(K;) and ↓ تصلّاها; he parched and darkened the<br>\
staff upon the fire; syn. لَوَّحَهَا: (M, K:) or صلّى<br>\
العَصَا he straightened the staff by turning it round<br>\
over the fire: (T in art. دوم: see an ex. in a verse<br>\
cited in that art., conj. 10:) and صَلَّيْتُ القَنَاةَ I<br>\
straightened the spear-shaft by means of fire:<br>\
(A, TA:) and صَلَّيْتُ العُودَ بِالنَّارِ I rendered supple<br>\
the stick, or branch, by means of fire. (Msb.)<br>\

اصطلى He warmed himself (M, K) بِالنَّارِ<br>\
[by means of the fire]: (M:) one says, اِصْطَلَيْتُ<br>\
بِالنَّارِ and بِهَا ↓ تَصَلَّيْتُ [app. meaning I warmed<br>\
myself by means of the fire]: (S:) or اصطلى النَّارَ<br>\
and بِالنَّارِ mean he became warm by means of the<br>\
fire: and بِالنَّارِ ↓ تصلّى, he became burnt by the<br>\
fire. (MA.) Hence, in the Kur [xxvii. 7 and<br>\
xxviii. 29], لَعَلَّكُمْ تَصْطَلُونَ [May-be ye will warm<br>\
yourselves]: (TA:) in relation to which it is said<br>\
that the time was winter, and therefore الاِصْطِلَآء<br>\
was needed. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also said of the<br>\
chameleon, as meaning He repaired to the sun.<br>\
(M and L in art. شقذ: see an ex. in a verse cited<br>\
voce شَقَذَانٌ.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And one says of a courageous<br>\
man, with whom one cannot cope, لَا يُصْطَلَى بِنَارِهِ<br>\
[lit. One cannot warm himself by means of his<br>\
fire; meaning (assumed tropical:)  one cannot approach him when<br>\
he is inflamed with rage, especially in fight, or<br>\
battle]. (S.) The phrase may be also used<br>\
satirically, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  One will not seek his<br>\
hospitality. (Meyd. [See Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov.<br>\
ii. 588.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 1, latter half, in two places.<br>\
صَلًى: see صَلَآءٌ.<br>\
صَلَآءٌ: see صَلَايَةٌ.<br>\
صِلَآءٌ Roasted, broiled, or fried, flesh-meat.<br>\
(S, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, as also ↓ صَلًى, (S, M, K,)<br>\
the former with kesr and the latter with fet-h,<br>\
(S,) Fuel; (S, * M, K;) syn. وَقُودٌ; (M, K, TA;<br>\
[in the CK, erroneously, وُقُود;]) i. e. مَا تُوقَدُ<br>\
بِهِ النَّارُ; (TA;) you say صِلَآءُ النَّارِ and صَلَى النَّارِ:<br>\
(S:) or both signify fire: (M, Mgh, K:) or صِلَآءٌ<br>\
signifies the heat of fire. (Msb.) One says, هُوَ<br>\
أَحْسَنُ مِنَ الصِّلَآءِ فِى الشِّتَآءِ [It, or he, is better<br>\
than fire in winter]. (TA.)<br>\
صَلِىٌّ: see مَصْلِىٌّ.<br>\
صَلَآءَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
صَلَايَةٌ and ↓ صَلَآءَةٌ, (S, M, Mgh, K,) the latter<br>\
with ء because ↓ صَلَآءٌ is used as the pl., [or rather<br>\
coll. gen. n.,] but not by those who say صَلَايَةٌ,<br>\
(Sb, M,) [for] the pl. [of this] is صُلِىٌّ and صِلِىٌّ<br>\
(K) and صَلَايَاتٌ, (MA,) i. q. فِهْرٌ [i. e. A stone<br>\
such as fills the hand; or of the size of that with<br>\
which one bruises and breaks walnuts and the<br>\
like]: (S:) or a thing with which perfume is<br>\
bruised, brayed, or pounded: (M, K:) or a stone<br>\
upon which one bruises, or powders, (MA, Mgh,)<br>\
perfume or some other thing; (Mgh;) that with<br>\
which [not upon which] one does so being called<br>\
مِدْوَكٌ. (MA.) Imra-el-Keys [in a verse of his<br>\
Mo&#39;allakah, (see EM p. 45,) as some relate it,]<br>\
uses the phrase صَلَايَةُ حَنْظَلِ, because colocynths,<br>\
when they have become dry, are split therewith.<br>\
(S. [But there are two other readings, صَرَايَة and<br>\
صَرَابَة.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K,) as being likened thereto,<br>\
(TA,) (assumed tropical:)  The forehead. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And the former<br>\
word, A rough, rugged, سَرِيحَة [or long strip] of<br>\
[high ground such as is termed] قُفّ. (ISh, Az,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
صِلِّيَانٌ: see art. صل.<br>\
[<br>\
صَالٍ is expl. by Freytag as meaning Heated<br>\
or warmed (“ calefactus ”), and burnt: and the<br>\
pl. is said by him to be صُلِىٌّ: but he names no<br>\
authority: if this be correct, it must be a possessive epithet from صَلِىَ.]<br>\
صَالِيَةٌ A support for the cooking-pot, such as is<br>\
termed أُثْفِيَّةٌ. (MA.)<br>\
مَصْلِىٌّ Roasted, broiled, or fried; as also<br>\
↓ صَلِىٌّ. (Ham pp. 13-14. [Both of these words<br>\
are there without any syll. signs.]) It is said in<br>\
a trad., أُتِىَ بِشَاةٍ مَصْلِيَّةٍ i. e. A roasted sheep, or<br>\
goat, was brought. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And صَيْحَانِيَّةٌ<br>\
مَصْلِيَّةٌ means [A date of the sort called صَيْحَانِىّ]<br>\
dried in the sun. (A, TA.)<br>\
أَرْضٌ مَصْلَاةٌ A land abounding with the plant<br>\
called صِلِّيَان. (K.)<br>\
مِصْلَاةٌ A snare that is set up for birds &amp;c.:<br>\
(S, M: *) pl. مَصَالٍ. (S, M.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
إِنَّ لِلشَّيْطَانِ فُخُوخًا وَمَصَالِىَ (S) or مَصَالِىَ وَفُخُوخًا<br>\
i. e. [Verily to the Devil belong snares and traps]<br>\
with which he catches men. (M.)<br>\
مُصْطَلًى The limbs of a man, or his arms and<br>\
legs and face and every prominent part, which<br>\
become cold at the time of death, and which are<br>\
warmed at the fire: (AHeyth, L in art. برد:) or<br>\
the face and extremities. (Z, TA.) One says,<br>\
بَرَدَ المَوْتُ عَلَى مُصْطَلَاهُ. (AHeyth, L in art. برد:<br>\
see 1 in that art.)<br>\
