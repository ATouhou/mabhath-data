(TA.) And البَيْعُ صَفْقَةٌ أَوْ خِيَارٌ Selling is decisive<br>\
or with the option of returning. (Mgh.) And it<br>\
is said in a trad. (of Ibn-Mes&#39;ood, TA), صَفْقَتَانِ<br>\
فِى صَفْقَةٍ رِبًا i. e. Two bargains in a [single]<br>\
bargain [are an unlawful gain]: this is of two<br>\
kinds: one is the seller&#39;s saying to the buyer, “I<br>\
sell to thee such a thing for a hundred dirhems on<br>\
the condition of thy buying of me this garment,<br>\
or piece of cloth, for such a sum: ” the other kind<br>\
is his saying, “I sell to thee this garment, or<br>\
piece of cloth, for twenty dirhems on the condition of thy selling to me thy commodity for ten<br>\
dirhems. ” (O.) And it is said in another trad.,<br>\
إِنَّ أَكْبَرَ الكَبَائِرِ أَنْ تُقَاتِلَ أَهْلَ صَفْقَتِكَ i. e. [Verily<br>\
the greatest of great sins is] thy fighting those<br>\
with whom thou hast made a covenant: because<br>\
each of the two persons making a covenant puts<br>\
his hand in the hand of the other, like as is done<br>\
by each of two persons selling and buying. (TA.)<br>\
صِفِقَّى or صِفَقَّى: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
صِفَاقٌ The inferior [or inner] skin, that is<br>\
beneath the skin upon which is the hair: (S, O,<br>\
K:) a thin skin beneath the upper skin and above<br>\
the flesh: (IAth, TA:) or the صِفَاق of the belly<br>\
is the skin, (M,) the inner skin, (TA,) that is<br>\
next to the سَوَاد, (M, TA,) the سَوَاد of the belly,<br>\
(TA,) [i. e. the liver,] and which is the part<br>\
where the farrier perforates the beast (بَنْقُبُ مِنَ<br>\
الدَّابَّةِ) [at the navel, in order that a yellow fluid<br>\
may issue forth]: (M, TA:) or the صَفَاق is the<br>\
part around the navel, where the farrier performs<br>\
the operation above mentioned: (AA, TA:) or<br>\
the skin which, when the مَسْك [or hide] is stripped<br>\
off, remains cleaving to the belly, and the rending<br>\
of which occasions a [rupture termed] فَتْق; so<br>\
says As, in the “ Book of the Horse: ” (TA:)<br>\
or what is between the جِلْد [or outer skin] and<br>\
the مُصْرَان [or intestines into which the food<br>\
passes from the stomach]; (ISh, O, K;) com-<br>\
prising all of what are termed the مَرَاقّ of the<br>\
belly, beneath the جِلْد thereof, to the سَوَاد of the<br>\
belly [i. e. the liver]; the مَرَاقّ of the belly being<br>\
all that has not a bone curving over it: (ISh,<br>\
O:) or the skin of the whole of the belly: (O, K:)<br>\
the pl. is صُفُقٌ, only. (M, TA.)<br>\
صَفُوقٌ An abominable acclivity or ascending<br>\
road or mountain-road difficult of ascent: pl.<br>\
صَفَائِقُ and صُفُقٌ. (M, K.) And A mountain,<br>\
(K,) or an obstacle, or elevated portion, of<br>\
mountains, (O,) such as is inaccessible. (O, K.)<br>\
And A smooth, high rock: pl. صُفُقٌ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, applied to a bow, Pliant.<br>\
(Fr, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [In the TA, in a verse of Aboo-Dhu-eyb describing a bow, to which it seems to<br>\
be there applied as an epithet, it is expl. as signifying راجعة; but I think that this is a mistranscription for رَاجِفَةٌ, meaning Quivering. ―<br>\
-b3-  Freytag<br>\
has assigned to it three explanations which belong<br>\
to صِفَاقٌ.]<br>\
صَفِيقٌ, applied to a garment, or piece of cloth,<br>\
(S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) strong, stout, or firm;<br>\
(M;) thick, substantial, close, or compact, in<br>\
texture: (Mgh, O, Msb, K:) and سَفِيقٌ is a dial.<br>\
var. thereof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Hardy, strong,<br>\
sturdy, enduring, or patient. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And applied to a face (S, O, K, TA) as meaning (tropical:)  Impudent; or having little shame. (O, K, TA.)<br>\
And رَجُلٌ صَفِيقُ الوَجْهِ (assumed tropical:)  A man having no shame.<br>\
(Har p. 368.)<br>\
صَفِيقَةٌ: see صَافِقَةٌ.<br>\
صَفَائِقُ Travelling-camels (رِكَابٌ) coming and<br>\
going. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also صَافِقَةٌ.<br>\
صَفَّاقٌ A cock that beats with his wings when<br>\
crowing. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It occurs in a trad., followed<br>\
by أَفَّاق in apposition, and is said by As to mean<br>\
اَلَّذِى يَصْفِقُ عَلَى أَمْرٍ عَظِيمٍ [app. One who goes<br>\
away on some great affair]: but in the opinion<br>\
of Az, it means one who makes many journeys,<br>\
and who employs himself, or uses art or artifice or<br>\
cunning, in affairs of traffic; thus nearly agreeing<br>\
in meaning with أفَّاقٌ. (O: the latter meaning<br>\
only is assigned to it in the K.)<br>\
صَافِقَةٌ A company (IDrd, M, O, K) of men<br>\
[alighting at one&#39;s abode]. (IDrd, M, O.) See<br>\
1, near the end. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A calamity, or misfortune: (M, TA:) pl. صَوَافِقُ: (M:) this pl. and<br>\
↓ صَفَائِقُ, (O, K, TA,) which latter may be pl. of<br>\
↓ صَفِيقَةٌ, (TA,) signify accidents, or evil accidents,<br>\
(O, K, TA,) and varieties, or vicissitudes, of<br>\
events. (O, TA.)<br>\
أَصْفَقُ A garment, or piece of cloth, more<br>\
[strong, stout, firm,] thick, substantial, close, or<br>\
compact, in texture, than another. (Mgh.)<br>\
أَصْفَقَانِيَّةٌ [written in one place with fet-h, and in<br>\
another with kesr, to the ف,] i. q. خَوَلٌ [A<br>\
man&#39;s slaves, or servants, and other dependents;<br>\
or slaves, and cattle, or camels &amp;c.;] in the dial.<br>\
of El-Yemen. (TA.)<br>\
مَصْفَقٌ A place of passage; a way, road, or<br>\
path; syn. مَسْلَكٌ. (O, TA.)<br>\
مُصَفَّقٌ [pass. part. n. of 2, q. v.]. One says,<br>\
لَكَ عِنْدِى وُدٌّ مُصَفَّقٌ وَنُصْحٌ مُرَوَّقٌ (tropical:)  [I have, for<br>\
thee, an affection defecated like wine that has been<br>\
transferred from one vessel to another and left to<br>\
settle, and a benevolence purified like clarified wine].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A full [or filled] drinking-vessel.<br>\
(Fr, TA.)<br>\
مُصَافِقٌ A camel lying, or sleeping, upon one<br>\
side one time and upon the other side another<br>\
time. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And مُصَافِقٌ بَيْنَ ثَوْبَيْنِ Wearing two garments, one of them over the other.<br>\
