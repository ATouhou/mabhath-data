(S, M, A, K) and مَصَابٌ, (Har p. 240,) said of<br>\
rain, (S, M, A, *) It poured forth; (M, A, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ انصاب: (M, K:) or it descended; and<br>\
↓ تصوّب signifies the like. (S.) A poet says,<br>\

صَوْبُ الرَّبِيعِ وَدِيمَةٌ تَهْمِى<br>\
which may mean, [And may] the descending of<br>\
the rain called the ربيع [and continuous rain, or<br>\
continuous and still rain, pouring forth, water<br>\

so says IHsh. (MF, TA.) And one says of a<br>\
calamity (شِدَّة), on the occasion of its befalling,<br>\
صَابَتْ بِقُرٍّ, meaning It became [or fell] in its قَرَار<br>\
[or settled or fixed place, or in the place where it<br>\
should remain]. (S, TA. [See also art. قر.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And صاب, aor. as above, (M, TA,) inf. n. صَوْبٌ,<br>\
(K, TA,) It, or he, came from a high place; (K,<br>\

went down, downwards, down a declivity, or<br>\
from a higher to a lower place or position; or it<br>\
sloped down; syn. اِنْحَدَرَ; and so ↓ تصوّب. (M,<br>\
TA. [See also 4, first sentence; and see 2, last<br>\
sentence.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, app.,] صَابُوا بِهِمْ They fell<br>\
upon them, or assaulted them: and agreeably<br>\
with this meaning is expl. the saying of the Hudhalee,<br>\
صَابُوا بِسِتَّةِ أَبْيَاتٍ وَأَرْبَعَةٍ<br>\
حَتَّى كَأَنَّ عَلَيْهِمْ جَابِئًا لُبَدَا<br>\
meaning [They fell upon, or assaulted, six tents,<br>\
or dwellings, and four; so that it was as though<br>\
there were upon them] numerous locusts. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  صَوْبٌ [app. meaning صَوْبُ مَطَرٍ] signifies also<br>\
The sky&#39;s bringing rain. (A, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The<br>\

app.,] صَوَّبْتُ الفَرَسَ (assumed tropical:)  I sent forth, or started, or<br>\

-b3-  And<br>\
تَصْوِيبٌ is the contr. of تَصْعِيدٌ [generally in a<br>\
trans. sense (though also in an intrans. sense as<br>\
will be seen below); i. e. it signifies The making<br>\

lowered, or depressed, his head. (S, A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K.) And صَوَّبَ اللّٰهُ رَأْسَهُ (tropical:)  [May God degrade him; lit.] may God lower, or depress, his<br>\
head. (TA.) It is said in a trad., مَنْ قَطَعَ سِدْرَةً<br>\
صَوَّبَ اللّٰهُ رَأْسَهُ فِى النَّارِ, which, accord. to Aboo-Dáwood Es-Sijistánee, is abridged, and means,<br>\
Whoso cuts down, or lops, a سدرة [which is a<br>\

manner, رَأْسَ الخَشَبَةِ [the head of the piece of<br>\
wood]. (T, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And صوّب إِلَيْهِ يَصَرَهُ [He<br>\
directed his sight towards him]. (Msb in art. لمح.<br>\

of تَصْعِيدٌ in an intrans. sense as well as in the<br>\
trans. sense mentioned above:] one says, طَالَ فِى<br>\
الأَرْضِ تَصْوِيبِى وَتَصْعِيدِى [Long have continued<br>\
my descending, or going down, and my ascending,<br>\
or going up, in the land]. (A in art. صعد.)<br>\

inf. n. صَيْبٌ, (S, TA,) likewise said of an arrow,<br>\
(S, M, TA,) signifies the same; (S, TA;) or صاب<br>\
said of an arrow is intrans. (M.) And اصاب<br>\

(M, A, TA,) aor. يَصُوبُ, (A, TA,) inf. n. صَوْبٌ<br>\
and صَيْبُوبَةٌ, (M, TA,) said of an arrow, (M, A,<br>\

-b2-  Also<br>\
اصاب القِرْطَاسَ, (S, TA,) and اصاب فِى القِرْطَاسِ,<br>\
(TA,) [said of a man, as is indicated by the<br>\
context in the S and TA, He hit the butt, or<br>\
target;] he did not miss the butt, or target.<br>\
(TA.) And اصاب alone is said of an archer or<br>\
the like [as meaning He hit the object of his<br>\
aim]: (Msb:) one says, رَمَى فَأَصَابَ [He shot, or<br>\
cast, and hit the object of his aim]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence, likening an event, &amp;c., to an arrow,] one<br>\
says also, اصابهُ أَمْرٌ, inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  [An event<br>\
smote him, or befell him;] and ↓ صابهُ, aor. يَصُوبُهُ,<br>\
inf. n. صَوْبٌ, signifies the same. (Msb.) And<br>\
أَصَابَتْهُ مُصِيبَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [An affliction, or a calamity, &amp;c.,<br>\
smote him, or befell him]. (S.) And اصابهُ الشَّىْءُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The thing reached him [so as to take effect upon<br>\
him]: (Mgh, * Msb:) whence the saying, أَصَابَهُ<br>\
مِنْ قَوْلِ النَّاسِ مَا أَصَابَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [There reached him &amp;c.,<br>\
of the sayings of the people, what reached him<br>\
&amp;c.]. (Msb.) [Thus tropically used, اصابهُ may<br>\
generally be rendered It hit, struck, smote,<br>\
wounded, hurt, affected, assailed, or befell, him.<br>\
One says, اصابهُ مَرَضٌ, and وَجَعٌ, and اصابتهُ رِيحٌ,<br>\
&amp;c., (assumed tropical:)  A disease, and pain, and wind, &amp;c., smote,<br>\
affected, or assailed, him.] And المَطَرُ ↓ صَابَهُ,<br>\

(Lth, M, TA:) or it means أَصَابَتْهَا بِصَوْبٍ [it<br>\
smote it with rain; or sent rain upon it]. (M, L,<br>\
TA.) In the following verse, cited by IAar,<br>\
فَكَيْفَ تُرَجِّى العاذِلَاتُ تَجَلُّدِى<br>\
حَمِيمُهَا ↓ وَصَبْرِى إِذَا مَا النَّفْسُ صِيبَ<br>\
he explains صِيبَ as being like قُصِدَ, and says that<br>\
it may be of the dial. of him who says صَابَ السَّهْمُ;<br>\
but [ISd remarks,] I know not how this is, for<br>\
صَابَ السَّهْمُ is not trans.; [though, as shown<br>\
above, he has mentioned it as being trans.;] and<br>\
in my opinion, [he says,] صيب here is from the<br>\
phrase صَابَتِ السَّمَآءُ الأَرْضَ [expl. above; the<br>\
meaning of the verse being, But how should the<br>\
censuring women hope for my constraining<br>\
myself to behave with hardiness, and for my<br>\
being patient, when the beloved of the soul has<br>\
been smitten by death, or by the decree of death;<br>\
for ISd adds,] كَأَنَّ المَنِيَّةَ صَابَتِ الحَمِيمَ فَأَصَابَتْهُ<br>\
بِصَوْبِهَا. (M, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b4-  [اصاب is also used in<br>\
many phrases in which its agent is likened to an<br>\
archer.] One says, اصاب الصَّوَابَ (tropical:)  [He hit the<br>\
right thing or point, or the object, or aim, of his<br>\
words or of his actions]: (A:) and اصاب السَّدَادَ<br>\
[which means the same]. (S in art. سد.) And<br>\
اصاب alone [means thus likewise; or] (assumed tropical:)  he said,<br>\
or did, that which was right. (M, K. *) And<br>\
اصاب فِى قَوْلِهِ وَفِعْلِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He hit the right thing in<br>\
his saying and his deed; (Msb;) and so فِى رَأْيِهِ<br>\
in his opinion; contr. of أَخْطَأَ. (A.) And<br>\
اصاب بِغْيَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He attained, or obtained, the thing<br>\
that he sought, or wanted: whence the saying,<br>\
اصاب مِنْ زَوْجَتِهِ [and so app. أَصَابَهَا (see سَفَقَ)]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He obtained his desired enjoyment of his wife:<br>\
(Msb:) اصاب مِنِّى occurs in a trad., [as a<br>\
euphemism,] said by the wife of Handhaleh,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He compressed me: (Mgh:) and it<br>\
is said in a trad., كَانَ يُصِيبُ مِنْ رَأْسِ بَعْضِ نِسَائِهِ<br>\
وَهُوَ صَائِمٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He used to kiss [the head of<br>\
some one or more of his wives when he was fasting]. (TA: and the like is said in the Mgh.)<br>\
And اصاب مِنَ المَالِ وَغَيْرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He took, or took<br>\
with his hand, of the property and other things.<br>\
(TA.) And اصاب الشَّىْءَ (tropical:)  [He hit upon, or<br>\
lighted on, the thing;] he found the thing. (S,<br>\
M, K, * TA.) And اصابهُ [(assumed tropical:)  He found it, met<br>\
with it, or experienced it; namely, a good or an<br>\
evil event. And (assumed tropical:)  He found it out, or discovered<br>\
it; namely, an enigma (see 8 in art. حجو) or the<br>\
like. And] (assumed tropical:)  He found it to be right: and (assumed tropical:)  he<br>\
saw it, considered it, or held it, to be right. (TA.<br>\
[See also 10.]) And (assumed tropical:)  He aimed at it; (As, TA;)<br>\
(tropical:)  he desired, wished, willed, intended, or meant,<br>\
it. (As, M, A, Msb, TA.) One says, أَصَابَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
الصَّوَابَ فَأَخْطَأَ الجَوَابَ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one aimed at, and<br>\
desired, [to say] that which was right, (As, Msb, *<br>\
TA,) and failed of giving rightly the reply. (As,<br>\
TA.) And أَيْنَ تُصِيبَانِ (assumed tropical:)  [Whither do ye two<br>\
desire to go?]; a saying of Ru-beh. (TA.)<br>\
تَجْرِى بِأَمْرِهِ رُخَآءً حَيْثُ أَصَابَ, in the Kur [xxxviii.<br>\
35, referring to the wind], has been expl. as<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Running by his command softly, or<br>\
gently,] whithersoever He desireth. (M, * TA.)<br>\
And اصاب اللّٰهُ الَّذِى أَرَادَ, said in a trad., in reply<br>\
to a question respecting the interpretation of a<br>\
text, means (assumed tropical:)  God desireth, or meaneth, [thereby,]<br>\
what He desireth, or meaneth. (TA.) And<br>\
اصاب اللّٰهُ بِكَ خَيْرًا means أَرَادَهُ (tropical:)  [i. e. May God<br>\
intend thee good]. (A.) And اصاب alone (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
desired, or intended, or meant, that which was<br>\
right. (M, K. *) One says also, اصابهُ بِخَيْرٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [meaning He did good to him]. (El-Muärrij,<br>\
TA in art. اسو.) [But] اصابهُ بِكَذَا, (M,) inf. n.<br>\
إِصَابَةٌ, (K,) with which are syn. ↓ مُصَابٌ [in<br>\
accordance with a usage generally allowable]<br>\
(S, TA) and ↓ مُصَابَةٌ, (K, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  [generally]<br>\
means He afflicted him with, or by, such a thing;<br>\
or gave pain to him thereby. (M, K: * in the<br>\
latter, only the inf. n. of the verb in this sense;<br>\
and so in other senses.) [Thus one says, اصابهُ بِشَرٍّ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He afflicted him with evil; or did evil to him:<br>\
and اصابهُ بِمَكْرُوهٍ (assumed tropical:)  He afflicted him with, or did<br>\
to him, an abominable, or an evil, thing or action:<br>\
and اصابهُ بِقَوْلٍ قَبِيحٍ (assumed tropical:)  He afflicted him with, or<br>\
said to him, a foul saying: and اصابهُ بِذَحْلٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He punished him by blood-revenge: and اصابهُ<br>\
بِمَرَضٍ (assumed tropical:)  He, (i. e. God,) or it, (a thing,) affected<br>\
him with disease; or rendered him diseased: and<br>\
in many similar cases, the phrase may be well<br>\
rendered with a verb derived from the noun; like<br>\
phrases in which “ affecit ” (a Latin equivalent of<br>\
اصاب) occurs; as in “ honore affecit,” meaning<br>\
“ honoravit. ”] El-Hárith Ibn-Khuld El-Makhzoomee says,<br>\
رَجُلًا↓أَظُلَيْمُ إِنَّ مُصَابَكُمْ<br>\
أَهْدَى السَّلَامَ تَحِيَّةً ظُلْمُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [O Dhuleymeh, verily your afflicting a man<br>\
who has given the salutation of peace, greeting, is<br>\
tyranny]: IB says that this verse is not of El-<br>\
&#39;Arjee, as El-Hareeree imagined it to be: the<br>\
correct reading is أَظُلَيْمُ, as above: ظليم is an<br>\
apocopated from of ظُلَيْمَةُ; which is the dim. of<br>\
ظَلُوم: some read أَظَلُومُ: and some, أَسُلَيْمُ: [the<br>\
verse is cited accord. to this last reading in the S:]<br>\
رَجُلًا is governed in the accus. case by مُصَاب [as<br>\
an inf. n.]: and ظُلْمُ is the enunciative of إِنَّ. (L,<br>\
TA.) أَصَابَهُمُ الدَّهْرُ بِنُفُوسِهِمْ وَأَمْوَالِهِمْ (assumed tropical:)  means<br>\
Time, or fate, afflicted them by destruction, or<br>\
extirpation, among themselves and their cattle, or<br>\
possessions. (M.) [In the K, الإِصَابةُ is expl. as<br>\
signifying الاِحْتِيَاجُ: but the right reading is<br>\
evidently الاِجْتِيَاحُ, as Ibr D has remarked in the<br>\
margin of my copy of the TA; so that اصاب<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  He destroyed, or extirpated; agreeably<br>\
with an explanation in the sentence next preceding<br>\
above, from the M.] مَنْ يُرِدِ اللّٰهُ بِهِ خَيْرًا يُصِبْ مِنْهُ,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  occurring in a trad., means Him whom God<br>\
intendeth good He trieth with afflictions, that He<br>\
may recompense him for them. (TA.) And one<br>\
says, مَا كُنْتُ مُصَابًا وَلَقَدْ أُصِبْتُ (assumed tropical:)  [app. meaning<br>\
I was not affected with weakness of intellect, or<br>\
madness, and I have become affected therewith:<br>\
see مُصَابٌ, below]. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تصوّب [quasi-pass. of 2]: see 1, in three<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also It was, or became, lowered, or<br>\
depressed; syn. تَسَفَّلَ. (A.)<br>\
6<br>\
تصاوب, accord. to Freytag, signifies He,<br>\
or it, was well directed: but for this he names no<br>\
authority.]<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْصَوَبَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
10<br>\
اِسْتَصْوَبَهُ and<br>\
اِسْتَصَابَهُ signify the same, (S,<br>\
M, A, Msb, K,) (tropical:)  He saw it, considered it, or<br>\
held it, to be right; (M, Msb, TA;) namely, his<br>\
deed, (S, Msb,) or his opinion, (M, TA,) or his<br>\
saying: (A:) Th says, اِسْتَصَبْتُهُ is the regular<br>\
form; but the Arabs say, اِسْتَصْوَبْتُ رَأْيَكَ. (M,<br>\
TA. [See also 4, latter half.])<br>\
صَابٌ A certain species of tree, from which, when<br>\
it is pressed, there issues what resembles milk, a<br>\
drop of which sometimes spirts into the eye,<br>\
producing an effect like that of a flame of fire,<br>\
and in some instances weakening the sight: (M,<br>\
TA:) or a certain kind of bitter tree; (As, T, M,<br>\
K, TA;) one of which is termed ↓ صَابَةٌ: (M, K: *<br>\
[in the latter it is said that صَابٌ is the pl. of صَابَةٌ;<br>\
but properly speaking, the former is a coll. gen. n.,<br>\
and the latter is its n. un.:]) or the expressed<br>\
juice of a kind of bitter tree: (S:) but accord. to<br>\
the K, this is a mistake, though it is the saying of<br>\
leading lexicologists: (TA:) or, as some say, the<br>\
expressed juice of the صَبِر [or aloes]. (M.)<br>\
صَوْبٌ an inf. n. used as a subst. (Msb) meaning Rain; (Lth, Msb;) and so ↓ صَيِّبٌ, which is<br>\
originally [صَيْوِبٌ, i. e.] of the measure فَيْعِلٌ from<br>\
الصَّوْبُ: (Bd in ii. 18:) or صَيِّبٌ is an epithet<br>\
applied to clouds (غَيْمٌ, Sh, O, or سَحَابٌ, S, Msb)<br>\
meaning having rain, (O,) i. q. ذُو صَوْبٍ: (S,<br>\
Msb:) or صَوْبٌ and ↓ صَيِّبٌ and ↓ صَيُّوبٌ [the<br>\
last of which is written in the CK صَيُوبٌ] all<br>\
signify the same, (M, K,) as epithets applied to<br>\
rain, meaning pouring forth: (M:) or ↓ صَيُّوبٌ,<br>\
which is originally of the measure فَيْعُولٌ, [being<br>\
altered from صَيْوُوبٌ,] means rain pouring forth<br>\
much, or abundantly: (IDrd, O:) [↓ صَائِبٌ, also,<br>\
is applied as an epithet to rain, like صَوْبٌ and<br>\
صَيِّبٌ; and] in the phrase صِيبَانُ المَطَرِ, accord. to<br>\
Abu-l-&#39;Alà, صِيبَان is pl. of صَائِب; or it may be<br>\
an inf. n., like حِرْمَان: and if one say ↓ صَيْبَان,<br>\
with fet-h, the meaning is, what has poured forth<br>\
of rain, notwithstanding the ى in it, for similar to<br>\
this are رَيْحَان from الرَّوْح and عَيْدَان (meaning<br>\
“ tall ” palm-trees) from العُوْد. (Ham p. 796.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Course, or tendency; syn. قَصْدٌ: so in<br>\
the saying, to one who is traversing a desert in<br>\
uncertainty and has declined from the right way,<br>\
أَقِمْ صَوْبَكَ [Rectify thy course]: and in the phrase<br>\
فُلَانٌ مُسْتَقِيمُ الصَّوْبِ [Such a one is pursuing the<br>\
right course], said of a person when he is not<br>\
declining from his way to the right or left. (TA.<br>\
[See also another ex. voce أَوْبٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A<br>\
place, or point, of tendency or direction or bearing, syn. جِهَةٌ, (Msb, TA,) of a thing; (Msb;)<br>\
and نَاحِيَةٌ [which means the same; and also a<br>\
side; or a lateral, or an adjacent, part or tract of<br>\
a thing; and in this sense صَوْبٌ is used in the<br>\
present day]; and جَانِبٌ [which generally has<br>\
the latter of these meanings]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also<br>\
صَوَابٌ, in three places.<br>\
صَابَةٌ: see مُصِيبَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Weakness, or feebleness, in the intellect; (M, A, K;) or a touch of<br>\
insanity therein; (A;) or somewhat of insanity,<br>\
or of madneess produced by diabolical possession.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
-A2-  See also صَابٌ.<br>\
صُوبَةٌ A collection, (جَمَاعَةٌ, M, or مُجْتَمَعٌ, K,)<br>\
or a collection, or heap, not measured nor weighed,<br>\
(صُبْرَةٌ, A) of wheat: (M, A, K:) a heap of wheat,<br>\
and of dates, and of other things: (M:) a quantity<br>\
collected together of dust or earth: (TA:) or anything collected together: (Kr, M, K:) a place in<br>\
which dates are collected and dried is thus called<br>\
by the people of El-Felj. (ISk, S.) One says,<br>\
دَخَلْتُ عَلَى فُلَانٍ فَإِذَا الدَّنَانِيرُ صُوبَةٌ بَيْنَ يَدَيْهِ i. e.<br>\

(S, M, A, Msb, K,) An affliction, a calamity, a<br>\
misfortune, a disaster, or an evil accident: (M,<br>\
Msb, TA:) it is said in the Towsheeh that the<br>\
primary signification of مُصِيبَةٌ is a shot with an<br>\
arrow: (TA:) the pl. is مَصَائِبُ, (S, M, A, Msb,)<br>\
the form commonly obtaining, (Msb,) but irregular, (M,) the Arabs agreeing in pronouncing it<br>\
with ء, as though they likened the radical letter to<br>\
the augmentative, (S,) or they imagined what is<br>\
of the measure مُفْعِلَةٌ to be of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ<br>\
without a radical ى or و, (M,) and it is thought<br>\
by As to be of the speech of the people of the<br>\
cities, (Msb,) and مَصَاوِبُ, (M,) which is the<br>\
original form, (S,) or is said to be so, (Msb,) and<br>\
is said by Zj to be the form preferred by the<br>\
grammarians, (TA,) and مُصِيبَاتٌ. (As, A, Msb.)<br>\
قَطٌّ مُصَوَّبٌ A nibbing in which the exterior of<br>\
the writing-reed is made to extend beyond the pith:<br>\
opposed to قَائِمٌ. (TA in art. حرف.)<br>\
