therefrom; the averting it, or repelling it therefrom: (M:) or the shifting a thing from one<br>\
state, or condition, to another; (Bd in vi. 105;)<br>\
and so ↓ التَّصْرِيفُ. (TA.) You say, صَرَفَهُ, (M,<br>\
K,) or صَرَفَهُ عَنْ وَجْهِهِ, (Msb, TA,) i. e. عَنْ سَنَنِهِ,<br>\

صَرْفٌ, (M, Msb,) He turned, sent, or put, him, or<br>\
it, away, or back, &amp;c., (M, K,) from his, or its,<br>\

away, or back, from the thing]. (M.) And<br>\

(S.) And صَرَفَ الصِّبْيَانَ He dismissed the boys,<br>\
or sent them away, syn. قَلَبَهُمْ, (S, K,) from the<br>\
school: (K:) or صَرَفْتُ الصَّبِىَّ I let the boy go<br>\

man. (Msb.) And صَرَفَ اللّٰهُ عَنْكَ الأَذَى [May<br>\
God avert from thee harm]. (S.) And ↓ اصطرف<br>\
وَجْهَهُ (K in art. سفو and سفى) [meaning صَرَفَهُ<br>\

صَرَفَ اللّٰهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ, in the Kur [ix. 128], means God<br>\
hath made them to err in requital of that which<br>\
they have done: (M, TA:) or God hath turned<br>\

the Kur xlvi. 28), or it (for ex. his mind or intention), to such a thing.] ―<br>\

(TA,) inf. n. صَرْفٌ, (O,) He declined, or inflected,<br>\
the word [i. e. the noun] with tenween. (O, TA.)<br>\

exchanging, or giving in exchange, gold for silver<br>\
[and the reverse]: because it is turned (يُصْرَفُ)<br>\
thereby from one metal to another. (M.) You<br>\
say صَرَفَ الدَّرَاهِمَ He exchanged, or gave in<br>\
exchange, the dirhems for [other] dirhems or for<br>\
deenárs. (Mgh.) And صَرَفْتُ الذَّهَبَ بِالدَّرَاهِمِ I<br>\

for deenárs]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It is said in a trad. respecting الشُّفْعَة [or the right of pre-emption], إِذَا صُرِفَتِ<br>\
الطُّرُوقُ فَلَا شُفْعَةَ i. e. When the roads thereof are<br>\
made distinct [app. by their being turned in different directions, from the house, or piece of land,<br>\
in question, to the possessions of different proprietors, there is no right of pre-emption]: (TA:)<br>\
the inf. n. of the verb in this case is صَرْفٌ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  You say also, صَرَفْتُ المَالَ I expended the property; (Msb;) [and so ↓ صرّفتُهُ; for] التَّصْرِيفُ,<br>\
(M,) or تَصْرِيفُ الدَّرَاهِمِ, (O,) فِى البِيَاعَاتِ, (M, O,<br>\
K, *) means the expending of money [in the purchase of articles of merchandise]. (M, O, K. *)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And صَرَفْتُ الكَلَامَ I embellished the speech<br>\

and ↓ صَرَّفْتُهُ has a similar, but intensive, meaning:<br>\
(Msb:) or صَرْفُ الحَدِيثِ means the embellishing<br>\
of discourse, or speech, (A &#39;Obeyd, S, M, O, K,)<br>\
by adding in it, (A &#39;Obeyd, S,) or and adding in<br>\
it; (M, O, K;) and in like manner صَرْفُ الكَلَامِ:<br>\
(K: [of which see another explanation voce<br>\
صَرْفٌ:]) and is [said to be] from الصَّرْفُ in pieces<br>\
of money, meaning “ the superiority of one over<br>\
another in value. ” (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  صَرَفَ لِأَهْلِهِ [as<br>\
though meaning صَرَفَ نَفْسَهُ لِأَهْلِهِ]: see 8. ―<br>\

also صَرْفٌ, below.]<br>\
-A2-  صَرَفَ الشَّرَابَ, (M, O, K,)<br>\
inf. n. صُرُوفٌ, (M, TA,) He did not mix the<br>\
beverage, or wine; (M, O, K, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ صرّفهُ, and ↓ اصرفهُ; the last mentioned by Th.<br>\
(M, TA.) And صَرَفَ الخَمْرَ, (K, TA,) aor.<br>\
صَرِفَ,<br>\
inf. n. صَرْفٌ, (TA,) [or perhaps this should be<br>\
صُرُوفٌ, as in the next preceding sentence,] He<br>\
drank the wine unmixed; (K, TA;) [and so<br>\
↓ صَرَّفَهَا; for] تَصْرِيفُ الخَمْرِ, (S, O,) or التَّصْرِيفُ<br>\
فِى الخَمْرِ, (K,) signifies the drinking of wine<br>\
unmixed. (S, O, K. [Freytag has erroneously<br>\
expl. صَرَفَ as meaning simply He drank wine.])<br>\
-A3-  صَرَفَتِ البَكْرَةُ, (S, O, K,) aor.<br>\
صَرِفَ, (S, O,) inf. n.<br>\
صَرِيفٌ, (S, M, O, K,) The sheave of the pulley<br>\
caused a sound to be heard on the occasion of the<br>\
drawing of water: (S, M, * O, K:) and the صَرِيف<br>\
of the door, and of the tush of the camel, is like<br>\
that of the sheave of the pulley; (S, O;) [i. e.]<br>\
the صَرِيف of the door, (M, K,) and of the writingreed (M, Msb) and the like, (M,) is a creaking, or<br>\
grating; (M, Msb, * K;) and so that of the tush<br>\
of the camel: (K: [ونابُ البَعِيرِ in the CK is a<br>\
mistake for ونابِ البعير:]) one says of a man, and<br>\
of a camel, صَرَفَ بِنَابِهِ, (M, TA,) and صَرَفَ نَابَهُ,<br>\
(TA,) aor.<br>\
صَرِفَ, inf. n. صَرِيفٌ, He grated his canine<br>\
tooth [against its opposite] so as to cause a sound<br>\
to be heard: (M, TA:) the صَرِيف of the stallioncamel is [indicative of] his threatening: (M:)<br>\
or that of the canine tooth of the she-camel denotes her weariness; and that of the canine tooth<br>\
of the he-camel, his lust: (IKh, TA:) or the<br>\
صَرِيف of the stallion is from briskness, liveliness,<br>\
or sprightliness; and that of the female, from<br>\
fatigue. (As, TA.) [But] ―<br>\
-b2-  صَرَفَتْ, (IAar, S,<br>\
M, O, K,) aor.<br>\

a cloven hoof and of any having a claw, (Lh, M,)<br>\
or of a ewe or she-goat and of bitch and of a cow,<br>\
(Lth, TA,) or of any female animal of prey, but<br>\
mostly of a bitch, (IAar, TA,) signifies She lusted<br>\
for the male: (Lth, Lh, IAar, S, M, O, K:) and the<br>\
epithet applied to such an animal is ↓ صَارِفٌ. (Lh,<br>\
IAar, S, M, O, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
التَّصْرِيفُ [in its primary acceptation is like<br>\
الصَّرْفُ in the primary acceptation of the latter,<br>\
but generally relates to several objects, or is used<br>\
in an intensive sense]: see 1, first sentence: it<br>\
signifies The turning of the winds (Lth, O, K,<br>\
TA) from one state or condition, to another; (O,<br>\
TA;) or from one direction, or course, or way, to<br>\
another; (Lth, O, K, TA;) and so of the torrents,<br>\
and of the horse, and of affairs, and of the verses<br>\
of the Kur-án; (Lth, TA;) the making of the<br>\
winds to very, or differ; and so of the clouds;<br>\
(M;) the changing of the winds to south and<br>\
north [&amp;c.] and hot and cold [&amp;c.]; (Jel in ii.<br>\
159, and xlv. 4;) or the making of the winds to be<br>\
south and north, and east and west, and to be of<br>\
various sorts in their kinds: (TA:) or تَصْرِيفُ<br>\
الآيَاتِ signifies [the varying, or diversifying, of<br>\
the verses of the Kur-án, by repeating them in<br>\
different forms; or] the making of the verses of<br>\
the Kur-án distinct [in their meanings by repeating and varying them, as expl. by many of the<br>\
expositors in the instances occurring in vi. 46 and<br>\
65 and 105, and xlvi. 26]. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It signifies<br>\
also The deriving one word from another [by<br>\
modification of the form for the purpose of<br>\
modifying the meaning; including what we term<br>\
the declining of nouns (like الصَّرْفُ) and the conjugating of verbs]. (O, K.) [The science of<br>\
التَّصْرِيف in language is commonly termed عِلْمُ<br>\
↓ الصَّرْفِ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  In relation to property, or money,<br>\
see 1, near the middle of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b4-  And in<br>\
relation to speech, see 1, near the middle of the<br>\
paragraph. ―<br>\
-b5-  One says also, صرّف الشَّىْءَ, (M,)<br>\
inf. n. as above, (TA,) meaning He employed the<br>\
thing in other [i. e. more] than one way; as<br>\
though he turned it from one way to another way.<br>\
(M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And [hence,] صَرَّفْتُهُ فِى الأَمْرِ, (K,)<br>\
or فِى أَمْرِى, speaking of a man, (S, O,) i. q.<br>\
قَلَّبْتُهُ [meaning I employed him to act in whatsoever way he pleased, according to his own judgment or discretion or free will, or I made him a<br>\
free agent, in the disposal, or management, of the<br>\
affair, or my affair: or (assumed tropical:)  I made him, or employed him, to practise versatility, or to use art<br>\
or artifice or cunning, in the affair, or in my<br>\
affair; for the quasi-pass., تصرّف, is said to be<br>\
from الصَّرْفُ as signifying الحِيلَةُ, and is expl. as<br>\
syn. with اِحْتَالَ: but the former meaning is the<br>\
more common: and it is also used as meaning<br>\
simply I employed him in the managing of the<br>\
affair, or my affair]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence also, صرّف<br>\
الفَرَسَ He exercised the horse.]<br>\
-A2-  صرّف الشَّرَابَ:<br>\
and صرّف الخَمْرَ: see 1, latter half.<br>\
3<br>\
صَاْرَفَ see 1, third sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  The inf. n. مُصَارَفَةٌ<br>\
signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The dealing, or buying and selling,<br>\
with any one بِصَرْفٍ [app. meaning with art or<br>\
artifice or cunning, or it may perhaps mean in<br>\
the exchanging of money: see صَيْرَفِىٌّ], (KL.)<br>\
4<br>\
اصرف الشَّرَابَ: see 1, latter half.<br>\
5<br>\
تصرّف [quasi-pass. of 2: thus,] said of a<br>\
man&#39;s face, It turned about; or was, or became,<br>\
turned about; syn. تقلّب. (Jel in ii. 139.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And It (a thing) was, or became, employed in<br>\
other [i. e. more] than one way; as though it<br>\
were turned from one way to another way. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] تصرّف فِى الأَمْرِ, (K,) or فِى أَمْرِى,<br>\
(S,) quasi-pass. of صَرَّفْتُهُ فِيهِ, (S, * O, K,) thus<br>\
syn. with تقلّب [meaning He acted in whatsoever<br>\
way he pleased, according to his own judgment or<br>\
discretion or free will, or as a free agent, in the<br>\
disposal, or management, of the affair, or my<br>\
affair; or he was, or became, employed to do so]:<br>\
(K:) or it is from الصَّرْفُ as signifying الحِيلَةُ;<br>\
(S, M, TA;) i. e. it means (tropical:)  [he practised versatility, or] he used art or artifice or cunning, in<br>\
the affair, or in my affair; syn. اِحْتَالَ. (TA<br>\
[and in like manner Bd in xxv. 20: but the<br>\
former meaning is the more common: see also<br>\
8].) [It is also used as meaning simply He employed himself, or was employed, in the managing<br>\
of the affair, or my affair; because the management of affairs generally requires the practice of<br>\
versatility, or the use of art or artifice or cunning.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence also, said of a horse, He was exercised.]<br>\
7<br>\
انصرف, (S, M, O, K,) inf. n. اِنْصِرَافٌ, (O,)<br>\
and مُنْصَرَفٌ is also sometimes an inf. n. thereof as<br>\
well as a n. of place, (S,) quasi-pass. of صَرَفَهُ, (S,<br>\
M,) said of a thing, (M,) or of a man; (S;) as<br>\
such signifying It [or he] turned, or went, away,<br>\
or back, from its [or his] way, or course; or was,<br>\
or became, turned, or sent, or put, away, or back,<br>\
therefrom; or averted, or repelled, therefrom:<br>\
(M:) [or shifted from one state, or condition, to<br>\
another: (see 1, first sentence:)] or i. q. اِنْكَفَّ;<br>\
so in the copies of the K; but [this is an inadequate explanation;] the right [or better] explanation is انْكَفَأَ [i. e. he, or it, reverted, or returned;<br>\
or was, or became, turned away or back]; agreeably with what is said in the O. (TA.) ثُمَّ انْصَرَفُوا<br>\
in the Kur [ix. 128] means Then they return, or<br>\
go back, from the place in which they have listened: or then they turn away from doing aught<br>\
of that which they have heard. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Accord.<br>\
to Golius, it signifies also It ran in a small<br>\
stream; or the like; for he explains it as meaning<br>\
“ manavit: ” but for this he names no authority.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Said of a noun, it means It was inflected, or<br>\
declined, with tenween.]<br>\
8<br>\
اصطرف (tropical:)  He sought, sought after, or sought<br>\
to gain, sustenance or the like, (M, TA,) and used<br>\
art or artifice or cunning [in so doing]; (M;)<br>\
for his family, or household; (M, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ صَرَفَ, aor.<br>\
صَرِفَ; you say, صَرَفَ لِأَهْلِهِ [as though<br>\
meaning صَرَفَ نَفْسَهُ لِأَهْلِهِ] and اصطرف: (M:) or<br>\
he used art or artifice or cunning (تصرّف) in the<br>\
seeking of gain: (O, K, TA:) or [meaning thus]<br>\
you say, اصطرف فِى طَلَبِ الكَسْبِ. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  It is<br>\
also trans.: you say, اصطرف وَجْهَهُ: see 1, first<br>\
quarter. ―<br>\
-b2-  And اصطرف الدَّرَاهِمَ He procured the<br>\
dirhems in exchange for [other] dirhems or for<br>\
deenars. (Mgh.)<br>\
10<br>\
اِسْتَصْرَفْتُ اللّٰهَ المَكَارِهَ (S, O, K) I begged<br>\
God to avert from me the things, or events, that<br>\
are objects of dislike or hatred. (O, K.)<br>\
صَرْفٌ [as an inf. n.: see 1]. ―<br>\
-b2-  Used as a subst.,<br>\
The evil accidents, mishaps, or calamities, of<br>\
time, or fortune; [thus expl. as having a pl. signification;] صَرْفُ الدَّهْرِ meaning حَدَثَانُهُ, (S, M,<br>\
O, K,) and نَوَائِبُهُ, (S, O, K,) or حَوَادِثُهُ; (Msb;)<br>\
because it [i. e. time, or fortune,] turns things<br>\
from their way, or course: (M:) [but it seems<br>\
to be more properly rendered the shifting of<br>\
fortune, or its shifting about; and to be an inf. n.<br>\
sometimes used as a simple subst., and therefore<br>\
having a pl., for] its pl. is صُرُوفٌ. (M, Msb.)<br>\
In the phrase قَدْ شَحَطَتْ صَرْفُ نَوَاهَا, in a verse<br>\
of Sakhr-el-Ghei, [ISd says,] he has made it<br>\
fem. because of its dependance upon النَّوَى [which<br>\
is fem.; as though the meaning were The afflictions that are the consequence of the course<br>\
taken by her in her journey have exceeded the<br>\
bounds of moderation]: (M:) [or it is here made<br>\
fem. because having the signification of a broken<br>\
pl., which is fem.:] or the meaning is, قَدْ بَعُدَتْ<br>\
تَصَرُّفُ وَجْهِهَا الَّذِى أَخَذَتْ فِيهِ [i. e. the shiftingabout of her course that she has taken has become<br>\
far-extending; صَرْف being thus used as an<br>\
inf. n.; for the Arabs sometimes make the inf. n.<br>\
fem., saying أَوْجَعَتْنِى ضَرْبُكَ as well as أَوْجَعَنِى<br>\
ضَرْبُكَ; (see EM p. 157;) and this I think the<br>\
most preferable explanation]. (Skr in his Expos.<br>\
of the Poems of the Hudhalees, p. 14 of the vol.<br>\
edited by Kosegarten.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Repentance. (S,<br>\
M, O, Msb, K.) [See a phrase below, in which<br>\
this and other meanings are assigned to it.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And (tropical:)  Art, artifice, or cunning. (Yoo, S, M, O,<br>\
K, TA.) Hence, in the Kur [xxv. 20], فَمَآ<br>\
يَسْتَطِيعُونَ صَرْفًا وَلَا نَصْرًا (tropical:)  [And they are not able<br>\
to put in practice art or artifice or cunning, nor<br>\
aid]: (S, TA:) or this means and they are not<br>\
able to avert, or repel, from themselves punishment, (O, K, TA,) nor to aid themselves. (O,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And Excellence, or superiority, of a<br>\
dirhem, (S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) and of a deenár,<br>\
(M,) over another, (S, M, &amp;c.,) in goodness, (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) or in value; (M, Mgh, O, K;) as<br>\
in the saying, بَيْنَ الدِّرْهَمَيْنِ صَرْفٌ [Between the<br>\
two dirhems is a difference of excellence], because<br>\
of the [superior] goodness of the silver of one of<br>\
them: (S:) and in like manner, of speech; (O,<br>\
K;) as in the saying فُلَانٌ لَا يَعْرِفُ صَرْفَ الكَلَامِ<br>\
Such a one knows not the excellence of speech over<br>\
other speech: (O:) and [in like manner] one says,<br>\
لِهٰذَا عَلَى هٰذَا صَرْفٌ There is, or pertains, to this,<br>\
an excess, and an excellence, over this; for when<br>\
one is judged to excel, it, or he, is turned aside<br>\
from its, or his, likes, or fellows. (O, K. *) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
And The night; and the day: (K:) [because of<br>\
their interchanging:] الصَّرْفَانِ signifies the night<br>\
and the day; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ الصِّرْفَانِ; (K;)<br>\
the latter accord. to Ibn-&#39;Abbád; (O;) like<br>\
الصِّرْعَانِ, with kesr also [as well as with fet-h].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  In the saying (S, M, O, Msb) of the<br>\
Arabs, (M,) or of the Prophet, (O, Msb,) in a<br>\
certain trad., (K,) لَا يُقْبَلُ مِنْهُ صَرْفٌ وَلَا عَدْلٌ<br>\
[Neither صَرْف nor عَدْل shall be accepted from<br>\
him], (S, M, * O, Msb, *) by صَرْف is meant<br>\
repentance; (S, M, O, Msb, K;) and by عَدْل,<br>\
ransom: (M, Msb, K:) or by the former, art, or<br>\
artifice, or cunning; (Yoo, S, M, O, K;) and by<br>\
the latter, ransom: (M:) or by the former,<br>\
acquisition of gain; and by the latter, ransom:<br>\
(K:) or by the former, a supererogatory act;<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, M, O, K;) and by the latter, an obligatory act: (A&#39;Obeyd, M, K:) or vice versâ:<br>\
(K:) or by the former, weight; and by the latter,<br>\
measure: (M, O, K:) or by the former, deviation;<br>\
and by the latter, a right, or direct, course:<br>\
(IAar, M:) or by the former, مَا يُتَصَرَّفُ فِيهِ [app.<br>\
meaning an evasive artifice]; and by the latter,<br>\
a like: (Th, M:) or by the former, value, or<br>\
price; and by the latter, a like; the saying<br>\
originally relating to the bloodwit (الدِّيَة): one<br>\
says, لَمْ يَقْبَلُوا مِنْهُمْ صَرْفًا وَلَا عَدْلًا, i. e. They did<br>\
not accept from them a bloodwit, nor did they<br>\
slay one man for him, of their people, who had<br>\
been slain; but they required from them more<br>\
than that; for the Arabs used [often] to slay two<br>\
men, and three, for one man; when they slew a<br>\
man for a man, that was العَدْل with them; and<br>\
when they took a bloodwit, having turned from<br>\
the blood to another thing, that was صَرْف, i. e.<br>\
the value, or price, was صَرْف: then the saying<br>\
was applied in relation to anything, so as to be<br>\
proverbially used in the case of him who was to<br>\
render more than was incumbent on him: it has<br>\
also been said that by صَرْف is meant [in the<br>\
saying cited above] something additional, or in<br>\
excess; but this is nought. (M.)<br>\
صِرْفٌ: see its dual in the next preceding paragraph, near the middle.<br>\
-A2-  Also Pure, unmixed,<br>\
or free from admixture; (S, M, Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
K;) applied to wine, (S, M, O, Msb, K,) or<br>\
beverage, as meaning unmixed, (S, M, O, Msb,)<br>\
and so ↓ مَصْرُوفٌ, (O, K,) and to other things,<br>\
(K,) to blood, and to phlegm, (TA,) and to anything (M, Msb) as meaning free from turbid<br>\
foulnesses: (Mgh, * Msb:) and ↓ صَرِيفٌ likewise<br>\
signifies anything having in it no admixture.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And A certain dye, (Msb,) a red dye,<br>\
(S, O, K,) with which the thongs, or straps, of<br>\
sandals are dyed, (S, O,) or with which the hide<br>\
is dyed: (Msb:) or a certain red thing with<br>\
which the hide is tanned (يُدْبَغُ [perhaps a mistranscription for يُصْبَغُ]). (So in a copy of the M.)<br>\
الصَّرْفَةُ One of the Mansions of the Moon; [the<br>\
Twelfth Mansion;] a single very bright star,<br>\
[<br>\
β of Leo,] (S, O, K, and Kzw in his Descr.<br>\
of the Mansions of the Moon,) by which are some<br>\
small evanescent stars; (Kzw;) over against,<br>\
(بِتِلْقَآء, so in my copies of the S,) or following,<br>\
(O, K and Kzw ubi suprà,) الزُّبْرَة; (S, O, K,<br>\
Kzw;) [i. e.] it is a single star behind the خَرَاتَانِ<br>\
of the Lion; (M;) it is on the hinder part of the<br>\
tail (ذَنَب) of the Lion; [wherefore it is called<br>\
by our astronomers Deneb;] and is also called the<br>\
قُنْب, which means the sheath of the penis, of the<br>\
Lion: (Kzw in his Descr. of Leo: [in the S and<br>\
O, erroneously, “the قَلْب of the Lion: ”]) [it<br>\
rose aurorally, in Central Arabia, about the<br>\
commencement of the era of the Flight, on the<br>\
8th of Sept., O. S.; and set aurorally on the<br>\
9th of March:] Ibn-Kunáseh says, (M,) it is<br>\
called الصَّرْفَةُ because of the turning away of the<br>\
cold (S, M, O, K) from the heat, (M,) and the<br>\
coming of the heat, (S, O,) accord. to the [O and]<br>\
K at its rising, but [as] IB says, correctly because of the turning away of the heat [at its<br>\
rising], and the coming of the cold: (TA:) [i. e.,<br>\
correctly,] it is thus called because of the turning<br>\
away of the cold at its setting in the early mornings, and the turning away of the heat at its<br>\
rising from beneath the rays of the sun in the<br>\
early mornings: (Kzw in his Descr. of Leo:)<br>\
when it rises before the dawn, that is the beginning of autumn; and when it sets with the<br>\
rising of the dawn, that is the beginning of spring.<br>\
(M.) [Hence,] الصَّرْفَةُ is [called] نَابُ الدَّهْرِ الَّذِى<br>\
يُفْتَرُّ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K,) or نَابُ الدَّهْرِ الَّذِى يَفْتَرُّ<br>\
عَنْهُ [The dog-tooth of time, or fortune, which it<br>\
shows smiling]: for when الصرفة rises, [a mistake<br>\
for “ sets, aurorally,”] the blossoms come forth<br>\
and the herbage attains its full height: (M and<br>\
K in art. فر:) in the T it is said that الصَّرْفَة is<br>\
called by the Arabs نَابُ الدَّهْرِ [the dog-tooth of<br>\
time, or fortune,] لِأَنَّهُ يَفْتَرُّ عَنِ البَرْدِ وَعَنِ الحَرِّ فِى<br>\
الحَالَتَيْنِ [i. e. because it smiles revealing (the<br>\
advent of) the cold and (that of) the heat, in its<br>\
two states (of auroral rising and setting)]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  صَرْفَةٌ also signifies A certain kind of bead<br>\
(خَرَزَةٌ); (Lh, S, M, O, K;) mentioned among<br>\
those by means of which men are captivated, or<br>\
fascinated, or restrained by women from other<br>\

Msb,) but (M, O) hard to be chewed, (M, O, K,)<br>\
tough, (M, O,) and the heaviest of all dates: (M,<br>\
O, Msb:) persons having households and slaves<br>\
and hired men provide it, because of its satisfying<br>\
quality, (O, K, [but for لجرآتِهَا in the O, referring<br>\
to the n. un., and لِجَزَاتِهَا in copies of the K, and<br>\
لجِزايَتِها in the CK, I read لِجَزَائِهَا, which is evidently the right reading, and agrees with what<br>\
here follows,]) and its standing in great stead:<br>\
(O, K:) or it is the [sort of dates called] صَيْحَانِىّ<br>\

sandal that make a creaking sound: (M:) [and<br>\
↓ صِرِّيفٌ likewise means making a creaking sound<br>\

A money-changer; (M, Msb, TA;) except that<br>\
صَرَّافٌ has an intensive signification [app. as<br>\

often used in the present day as meaning a banker]:<br>\
(Msb:) all are applied to him who knows and<br>\
distinguishes the relative excellence, or superiority,<br>\
of pieces of money: (Mgh:) these appellations<br>\
are from المُصَارَفَةُ, (S, O,) or from التَّصَرُّفُ, (M,)<br>\
or from صَرْفٌ meaning “ excellence,” or “ superiority,” of one dirhem [or deenár] over another,<br>\
(Mgh, and Msb on the authority of IF in relation<br>\
to the first,) because such as excels, or is superior,<br>\
is turned aside from the deficient: (Mgh:) the<br>\
pl. is صَيَارِفَةٌ (S, M, O, K) and صَيَارِفُ (M) and<br>\
صَيَارِيفُ, this last occurring in poetry, (S, M, O,<br>\
K,) by poetic license, for the sake of the measure.<br>\
