(M:) or it signifies [only] he cut it (قَطَعَهُ) so as<br>\
to separate it: (M, K:) namely, a thing, (S,) such<br>\

says, صُرِمَتْ أُذُنُهُ i. q. صُلِمَتْ [i. e. His ear was<br>\
cut off, entirely]. (TA.) And صَرَمَ النَّخْلَ, (S,<br>\

with damm. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. ضَرْبٌ. (K. [So,<br>\
app., in all the copies; accord. to the TK as meaning A sort, or species: but I think it most probable that this is a mistranscription for صِرْبٌ, with<br>\

↓ صَرَّامٌ signifies A seller thereof. (TA.)<br>\

[which is variously explained (see 2 in art. غرز), in<br>\
the CK and in one of my copies of the S erroneously written التَّغْزِير,] which a man draws when<br>\
in need of it. (S, K. *) Bishr says,<br>\
أَلَا أَبْلِغْ بَنِى سَعْدٍ رَسُولًا<br>\
وَمَوْلَا هُمْ فَقَدْ حُلِبَتْ صُرَامُ<br>\
[Now deliver thou to Benoo-Saad a message, and<br>\
to their chief, that the last milk in the udder<br>\
has been drawn]: (S:) the last two words [the<br>\
latter of which is written in the CK ↓ صَرامِ] are a<br>\
prov., meaning (assumed tropical:)  the excuse has reached its uttermost: (S, K:) thus says AO: (S:) IB says that<br>\

[Applied to the lungs, it means properly Burst<br>\
asunder. Hence the saying,] جَآءَ صَرِيمَ سَحَرٍ, [so<br>\
in copies of the K, accord. the TA سِحْر, but<br>\
correctly either سَحَرٍ or سَحْرٍ q. v., in the CK باءَ<br>\
and صَرِيمُ, which last word is obviously wrong,]<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  He came disappointed of attaining<br>\
what he desired, or sought, and in a state of<br>\

dryness: (Bd:) or like that garden of which the<br>\
fruits have been cut off: (Bd, TA: *) or like the<br>\
