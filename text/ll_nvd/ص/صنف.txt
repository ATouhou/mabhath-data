صنّفهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَصْنِيفٌ, (S, M, O, K,)<br>\
He assorted it; i. e. made it into, or disposed it<br>\
in, sorts, or species; (S, O, K;) and separated, or<br>\
distinguished, its several parts or portions or<br>\
constituents, one from another: (S, M, O, K:)<br>\
التَّصْنِيفُ is the separating, or distinguishing, of<br>\
things, one from another. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,<br>\
(Z, Msb, * TA,) تَصْنِيفُ الكُتُبِ (Z, TA) or الكِتَابِ:<br>\
(Msb:) you say, صنّف الكِتَابَ, inf. n. as above,<br>\
He composed the book. (MA.)<br>\
-A2-  صنّفت العِضَاهُ<br>\
The [trees called] عضاه became green: (M:) and<br>\
صنّف الشَّجَرُ the trees put forth their leaves: (O,<br>\
K: [and the like is said in the Msb:]) AHn says<br>\
that this signifies the trees began to leaf, so that<br>\
they were of two sorts, one sort that had leaved<br>\
and one sort that had not leaved; but this is not<br>\
a valid saying; and in like manner ↓ تصنّف:<br>\
(M:) accord. to the A, both signify the trees<br>\
became of different sorts; and in like manner<br>\
النَّبَاتُ [the plants, or herbage]: (TA:) and صنّف<br>\
الثَّمَرُ, inf. n. as above, signifies the fruits became<br>\
so that some of them were ripe exclusively of<br>\
others, and some of them coloured exclusively of<br>\
others: (Msb:) and الأَرْطَى ↓ تصنّف, and النَّبْتُ,<br>\
the [trees called] ارطى, and the plants, or herbage,<br>\
broke forth to leaf. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.) &#39;ObeydAlláh Ibn-Keys-er-Rukeiyát says,<br>\
سَقْيًا لِحُلْوَانَ ذِى الكُرُومِ وَمَا<br>\
صَنَّفَ مِنْ تِينِهِ وَمِنْ عِنَبِهْ<br>\
[May there be a sending down of rain to Hulwán, the possessor of vines, and of such as have<br>\
put forth their leaves, of the fig-trees and the<br>\
grape-vines thereof]: (O, K:) it is said in the K<br>\
that the verb in this verse is thus, from صنّف<br>\
الشَّجَرُ, not from صنّفهُ; and that J has erred in<br>\
the reading that he has given; for the reading<br>\
given by J, who ascribes this verse to Ibn-Ahmar, is صُنِّفَ; but this is the reading of<br>\
Fr, [as is said in the O,] and both readings are<br>\
correct; and of the latter, [accord. to which the<br>\
meaning is, and of such as have been made to<br>\
consist of various sorts or species, of the fig-trees<br>\
and the grape-vines thereof,] MF says, it is that<br>\
which the case requires, the commendation being<br>\
for the abundance and variety of the fruits of the<br>\
trees, rather than for the trees putting forth their<br>\
leaves. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَصَنَّفَ see above, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also,<br>\
تصنّفت شَفَتُهُ His lip became chapped. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O, K.) And تصنّف سَاقُ النَّعَامَةِ The<br>\
shank of the ostrich became chapped. (TA.)<br>\
صَنْفٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
صِنْفٌ and ↓ صَنْفٌ A sort, or species, (Lth, S,<br>\

constituent, of anything: (Lth, Msb, TA:) pl.<br>\

Msb) صُنُوفٌ. (M, O, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also the former, i. q. صِفَةٌ [meaning A quality, an attribute,<br>\
a property; or a description, as meaning the<br>\
aggregate of the qualities or attributes or properties, of a thing, or the state, condition, or case,<br>\

the side thereof that has no fringe of unwoven<br>\
threads: (S, O, K:) or (M, K) its طُرَّة [or border]<br>\
(M) upon which is the fringe consisting of unwoven threads: (M, K:) or any border, or side,<br>\
thereof: (S, M, O, K:) accord. to IDrd, it is,<br>\
with the lexicologists, the side (حَاشِيَة) of a garment; and with others, the part in which is the<br>\
fringe of unwoven threads: (O:) and the corner<br>\
of a garment: the pl. of صَنِفَةٌ is صَنِفَاتٌ and [coll.<br>\
gen. n.] ↓ صَنِفٌ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  صَنِفَاتٌ, as used by a<br>\
poet describing the سَرَاب [or mirage], means,<br>\
accord. to Th, (tropical:)  The sides, or borders, of the<br>\
سراب; the سراب being likened by him to a [garment such as is called] مُلَآءَة. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\

Nights]. (S, O.)<br>\

ostrich having his shanks excoriated: (M, O, K:)<br>\
pl. صُنْفٌ. (K.)<br>\

-b2-  [As a subst., A<br>\
literary composition; as also ↓ مُصَنَّفٌ: pl. of the<br>\
former تَصَانِيفُ; and of the latter مُصَنَّفَاتٌ.]<br>\
أَصْنَافٌ مُصَنَّفَةٌ [Sorts, or species, separated, or<br>\
