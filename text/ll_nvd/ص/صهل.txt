صَهَلَ, said of a horse, aor.<br>\
صَهِلَ (S, O, Msb, K)<br>\
and<br>\
صَهَلَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. صَهِيلٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
[and تَصْهَالٌ is an intensive inf. n., (see صَهِيلٌ<br>\
below,)] He neighed; lit. uttered his voice; or<br>\
voiced. (S, O, K.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَصَاهَلَتِ الخَيْلُ The horses neighed, one to<br>\
another. See an ex. in a verse cited voce رُودٌ,<br>\
where تَصَاهَلْ occurs for تَتَصَاهَلْ.]<br>\
صَهْلٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
صَهَلٌ A voice with hoarseness, roughness, harshness, or gruffness; [this is app. correct, or nearly<br>\
so; but what follows I think evidently wrong;<br>\
and probably taken from a copy of the O, in this<br>\
instance incorrect;] like ↓ صَهْلٌ: and صَهْلٌ is syn.<br>\
with صَحْلٌ: (K accord. to the CK and TA: [to<br>\
which is added in the TA, i. e. hoarseness, roughness, harshness, or gruffness, in the voice:]) or syn.<br>\
with صَحَلٌ: (so in my MS. copy of the K:)<br>\
[the explanation given by Sgh appears to be correctly as follows:] one says, فِى صَوْتِهِ صَهَلٌ and<br>\
صَحَلٌ, i. e. [In his voice is] sharpness and hardness: it is said in a trad. of Umm-Maabad, فِى<br>\
صَوْتِهِ صَهَلٌ or صَحَلٌ, accord. to different relations:<br>\
and A&#39;Obeyd says that الصَّهَلُ is like البَحَحُ [i. e.<br>\
hoarseness, &amp;c.], not intense, but pleasing. (Thus<br>\
I find in the O.) [It is said in Har p. 646<br>\
that الصحل and ↓ الصهل signify المَآء القليل: but<br>\
I think that this has been taken from some commentator who had found الصحل and الصهل erroneously written for الضَّحْلُ and الضَّهْلُ, with ض.]<br>\
صَهَالٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
صَهِيلٌ [an inf. n., see 1,] and ↓ صُهَالٌ (S, O, K)<br>\
and ↓ صَاهِلَةٌ, of which the pl. is صَوَاهِلُ, (O, K,)<br>\
and ↓ تَصْهَالٌ, [which last is an intensive inf. n.,]<br>\
(O,) The neighing or neigh, lit. the voicing or<br>\
voice, of the horse: (S, O, K:) similar to نَهِيقٌ<br>\
and نُهَاقٌ (S, TA) in relation to the ass. (TA.)<br>\
أَهْلُ صَهِيلٍ وَأَطِيطٍ means Possessors of horses and<br>\
of camels: (TA in art. اط:) it is said in a trad.<br>\
of Umm-Zara, فَجَعَلَنِى فِى أَهْلِ صَهِيلٍ وَأَطِيطٍ<br>\
[And he set me among possessors of horses and of<br>\
camels]: (O, TA:) she meant that she was among<br>\
people of little property, and he transferred her to<br>\
people of much wealth; for the possessors of<br>\
horses and of camels are more [rich] than the<br>\
possessors of sheep or goats. (TA in the present<br>\
art.)<br>\
صَهَّالٌ Neighing, lit. uttering his voice; [or<br>\
rather that neighs much or often;] an epithet<br>\
applied to a horse; (JK, * S, Msb, * K;) and so<br>\
↓ صَاهِلٌ and ↓ ذُو صَاهِلٍ. (JK. [But these two<br>\
I find not elsewhere in this sense.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
بَنَاتُ صَهَّالٍ Horses. (TA in art. بنى. [It should<br>\
be observed that بَنَات applied to irrational beings<br>\
is pl. of اِبْنٌ as well as of اِبْنَةٌ.])<br>\
صَاهِلٌ and ذُو صَاهِلٍ: see صَهَّالٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  صَاهِلٌ applied to a he-camel signifies That strikes, or beats,<br>\
(O, K,) with his fore leg and his hind leg, (K,) and<br>\
bites, and does not ever utter a grumbling cry, in<br>\
consequence of his disdainfulness, (O, K,) but whose<br>\
inside makes a confused and continued, or rumbling,<br>\
sound, (K, TA,) by reason of his disdainfulness:<br>\
(TA:) so expl. by Lth: one says جَمَلٌ صَاهِلٌ and<br>\
ذُو صَاهِلٍ: (O, TA:) and نَاقَةٌ ذَاتُ صَاهِلٍ (O, K)<br>\
and بِهَا صَاهِلٌ: (O, TA:) or ذُو صَاهِلٍ signifies a<br>\
stallion camel excited by lust, assaulting [the<br>\
she-camels], and causing a sound to be heard from<br>\
his inside; as also ذُو شَاهِقٍ. (TA in art. شهق.)<br>\
And ذُو صَاهِلٍ applied to a man, (assumed tropical:)  Vehement in<br>\
springing or rushing, or in assaulting or attacking, and in excitement or provocation: (M, K,<br>\
TA:) or a man whose anger is vehement; as also<br>\
ذُو شَاهِقٍ. (TA in art. شهق.)<br>\
[<br>\
صَيْهَلٌ is expl. by Reiske as signifying Firma<br>\
ac tenax durities: so says Freytag: but I find<br>\
not any authority for this.]<br>\
صَاهِلَةٌ: see صَهِيلٌ: and see also ثُغَآءٌ, in art.<br>\
ثغو. ―<br>\
-b2-  Its pl., صَوَاهِلُ, is also applied (by the poet<br>\
Aboo-Zubeyd Et-Tá-ee, O, TA) to The sounds of<br>\
مَسَاحٍ [i. e. iron shovels or spades]. (O, K.) Also<br>\
(by the poet Temeem Ibn-Abee-Mukbil, O, TA)<br>\
to The sounds of flies among herbage; (O, K;)<br>\
app. meaning the humming or buzzing, [sounds]<br>\
of their flying. (O, TA.)<br>\

put him to sleep in the sun, in consequence of a<br>\
disease. (JK.)<br>\

صَهْوَةٌ The part of the back, of a horse, which is<br>\
the place of the saddle-cloth: (S:) or the smooth,<br>\
or soft, part (ما أَسْهَلَ [so in copies of the K, but<br>\
the right reading is app. ما أُسْهِلَ, lit. the part that<br>\
is found to be smooth, or soft, to sit upon, see an<br>\
ex. of this verb in the Ham p. 675,]) of the two<br>\
sides of the سَرَاة [or back] of the horse: (K:) or<br>\
the part, of the back, of the horse, whereon the<br>\

of the hump of the camel; (JK, K;) also called<br>\

called] رَادِفَة, which one sees above the rump:<br>\
