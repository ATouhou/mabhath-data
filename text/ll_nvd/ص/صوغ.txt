صَاغَهُ, (S, MA, O, Msb, K,) aor. يَصُوغُ, (S,<br>\
O, Msb,) inf. n. صَوْغٌ (S, MA, O, Msb) and صُوَاغٌ<br>\
(TA) and صِيَاغَةٌ, (MA,) [or the last is a simple<br>\
subst.,] He melted it, and poured it forth into a<br>\
mould; (TA;) he cast it, molten, in a mould:<br>\
(PS:) he made, formed, fashioned, or moulded,<br>\
it, by the goldsmith&#39;s art; namely, an ornament<br>\
[and the like]: (MA: [this last is the most usual<br>\
meaning:]) or he prepared it, (K, TA,) and cast<br>\
it, (TA,) namely, a thing, after the pattern of a<br>\
right model. (K, TA.) One says of a man, صَاغَ<br>\
الذَّهَبَ حُلِيًّا [He cast the gold so as to make of it<br>\
ornaments; or he made, formed, fashioned, or<br>\
moulded, the gold into ornaments]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] صَاغَهُ اللّٰهُ صِيغَةً حَسَنَةً (tropical:)  God created him<br>\
(S, O, K, TA) in a goodly mode, or manner, of<br>\
creation. (O, TA.) And صِيغَ عَلَى صِيغَتِهِ (tropical:)  He<br>\

(Msb,) (tropical:)  Such a one forges, or fabricates, that<br>\

-A2-  صاغ, aor. يَصُوغُ, (O, K,) inf. n. صَوْغٌ, (O,)<br>\
also signifies It sank into the ground, said of<br>\
water; and into the food, said of sauce, or seasoning: (O, K:) so says ISh. (TA.) ―<br>\

لَهُ الشَّرَابُ The beverage, or wine, was easy and<br>\
agreeable to him to swallow; i. q. ساغ, (Ibn-<br>\

5<br>\
تصوّغ: see what next follows.<br>\
7<br>\
انصاغ quasi-pass. of صَاغَهُ [in all its senses,<br>\
proper and tropical: meaning It was, or became,<br>\
melted, and poured forth into a mould; &amp;c.: and<br>\
in like manner Freytag explains ↓ تصوّغ as used<br>\
in the book entitled “ Les oiseaux et les fleurs,”<br>\
p. 7, meaning “ formatus, fictus fuit; ” but this is<br>\
app. post classical]. (O, K.)<br>\
صَوْغٌ inf. n. of صَاغَهُ [q. v.]. (S &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [In the<br>\
Kur xii. 72,] some read نَفْقِدُ صَوْغَ المَلِكِ [meaning<br>\
We miss, or see not, or find not, the King&#39;s molten<br>\
vessel, or vessel made of melted metal]: in this<br>\
instance, صَوْغ is an inf. n. (O, K, TA) used as a<br>\
subst., (O, TA,) in the sense of ↓ المَصُوغ, which<br>\
means مَاصِيغَ [i. e. the thing that has been melted,<br>\
and poured forth into a mould; &amp;c.]; like<br>\
↓ المُصَاغُ [a pass. part. n. of a verb which is not<br>\

هٰذَا دِرْهَمٌ ضَرْبُ الأَمِيرِ, (O, K, * TA,) meaning<br>\
مَضْرُوبُهُ: (O, TA:) and Er-Rághib says that it<br>\
[i. e. the vessel thus termed] is held to have been<br>\
made of molten gold: (TA:) some read [in the<br>\
Kur xii. 72] ↓ صُوَاغ, as though this also were<br>\
[originally] an inf. n. (O, K, TA) from صَاغَ, (O,<br>\
TA,) like بُوَالٌ and قُوَامٌ (O, K, TA) from بَالَ and<br>\
قَامَ. (O, TA.) [See also صَاعٌ, with the unpointed<br>\
ع.] ―<br>\
-b3-  One says also, هٰذَا صَوْغُ هٰذَا This is of the<br>\
measure of this; or is the like in measure of this:<br>\
[as though of the make, form, fashion, mould, or<br>\
cast, of this: (see also صِيغَةٌ:)] (S, O, Msb:)<br>\
and هٰذَا المَآءُ صَوْغُ الإِنَآءِ This water is of the<br>\
measure of the vessel; or is the like in measure of<br>\
the vessel: and everything that is the like in<br>\
measure of another thing is said to be صَوْغُهُ. (O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And هُمَا صَوْغَانِ They two are likes: (S, O,<br>\
K:) or they two are coëtaneans; syn. لِدَةٌ [which<br>\
is properly a sing., though here used as a dual].<br>\
(IDrd, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And هُوَ صَوْغُ أَخِيهِ (AA, O, K)<br>\
He is he who was born immediately after his<br>\
brother; and [in like manner, before him, for] he<br>\
may be above him and he may be below him,<br>\
(O,) like سَوْغُهُ; as also أَخِيهِ ↓ صَوْغَةُ, (K, TA,<br>\
[in the CK, erroneously, اُخْتِهِ,]) like سَوْغَةُ أَخِيهِ:<br>\
(TA:) and هِىَ أُخْتُكَ صَوْغُكَ and ↓ صَوْغَتُكَ [She<br>\
is thy sister who was born immediately after thee;<br>\
or before thee]: (O, TA:) the pl. is أَصْوَاغٌ. (TA<br>\
voce سَوْغٌ.)<br>\
صَوْغَةٌ: see the last sentence here preceding, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
صِيغَةٌ is originally صِوْغَةٌ, (S, O, Msb,) the و<br>\
being changed into ى because of the kesreh before<br>\
it: (S O:) it is like قِيمَةٌ. (Msb.) [Its primary<br>\
signification is A mode, or manner, of صَوْغ i. e.<br>\
melting, and pouring forth into a mould; &amp;c.:<br>\
and hence it signifies a make, form, fashion,<br>\
mould, or cast:] and it is syn. with صِيَاغَةٌ, q. v.:<br>\
(TA:) and signifies the making [a thing]; and<br>\
making according to a certain measure or proportion [and the like]. (Msb.) One says سِهَامٌ صِيغَةٌ<br>\
(S, O, K) Arrows [one in make;] uniform;<br>\
(TA;) of the make of one man. (S, O, K, * TA.)<br>\

(Msb.) And هُوَ حَسَنُ الصِّيغَةِ (tropical:)  He is goodly in<br>\
respect of make and of stature: or this means<br>\
هُوَ حَسَنُ العَمَلِ [which may in this case be correctly rendered he is goodly in respect of make:<br>\
and also he is good in respect of work]. (TA.)<br>\
And هُوَ مِنْ صِيغَةٍ كَرِيمَةٍ (tropical:)  He is of a generous<br>\
origin. (Ibn-&#39; Abbád, Z, O, K, TA.) And صِيغَةُ<br>\
القَوْلِ كَذَا (tropical:)  The mode, manner, fashion, or form,<br>\
of the saying is thus. (Msb.) And صِيغَةُ الأَمْرِ<br>\

this last mentioned by Lh. (TA.)<br>\
صَوَّاغٌ: see the next paragraph, in five places.<br>\
صَائِغٌ and ↓ صَوَّاغٌ (S, MA, O, Msb, K, KL) and<br>\
↓ صَيَّاغٌ, (S, O, K, KL,) the last of the dial. of El-<br>\
Hijáz, (S, O,) originally صَيْوَاغٌ, (IJ, O, TA,) thus<br>\
altered by some, from صَيْوَاغٌ to صَيَّاغٌ, because of<br>\
their disliking the double و, (IJ, TA,) One who<br>\
practises, or performs, the craft, art, work, or<br>\
operation, termed صِيَاغَة [or melting gold &amp;c., and<br>\
pouring it forth into a mould; &amp;c.; as expl. in<br>\
the first sentence of this art.]; (S, O, Msb, K,<br>\
TA;) [generally meaning] a goldsmith, or worker<br>\
in gold: (MA, KL:) the pl. of صَائِغٌ is صَاغَةٌ<br>\
[originally صَوَغَةٌ] and صُوَّاغٌ and صُيَّاغٌ. (TA.)<br>\
One says, الحُلِىِّ ↓ هُوَ صَوَّاغُ [and صَائِغُهَا i. e. He<br>\
is the moulder of ornaments, or of women&#39;s ornaments, of gold or of silver &amp;c.]. (TA.) [And<br>\
hence مِلْحُ الصَّاغَةِ lit. Goldsmiths&#39; salt; meaning<br>\
chrysocolla, i. e. borax: thus termed in the language of the present day.] Aboo-Ráfi&#39; the صَائِغ<br>\

يَقُولُ اليَوْمَ وَغَدًا ↓ أَكْذَبُ النَّاسِ الصَّوَّاغُ [&#39; Omar<br>\
used to jest with me, saying, The most lying of<br>\
men is the goldsmith, who says, To-day, and Tomorrow]. (TA.) And ↓ كَذِبَةٌ كَذَبَهَا الصَّوَّاغُونَ<br>\
[lit. A lie which the goldsmiths have told] is a<br>\
saying (of Aboo-Hureyreh, O) occurring in a<br>\
trad. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] the pl. صُوَّاغٌ means<br>\
(tropical:)  Persons who alter speech, [embellish it with lies,]<br>\
and falsify it, or forge it: and ↓ صَوَّاغٌ, (tropical:)  one who<br>\

with lies: (TA:) and [in like manner] ↓ صَيِّغٌ, (O,<br>\
K, TA,) originally صَيْوِغٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  one who lies<br>\
much, and embellishes his speech [with lies]: (K,<br>\
O, TA:) the pl. of this last is صَاغَةٌ, like سَادَةٌ pl. of<br>\

صَيِّغٌ, originally صَيْوِغٌ: see the next preceding<br>\
paragraph, last explanation.<br>\
