صَدَغْتُهُ, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, O, K, *) aor.<br>\
صَدَغَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. صَدْغٌ, (TK,) [may be rendered I walked,<br>\
or went along, cheek by jole with him; lit.] I had<br>\
my صُدْغ [or temple] over against his (another<br>\
man&#39;s) in walking, or going along. (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
S, O, K *) [See also 3. Accord. to Golius, it<br>\
means also I overtook him, and joined myself to<br>\
him by his side: but for this explanation he names<br>\
no authority.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And صَدَغَهُ, aor. as above [and<br>\
probably<br>\
صَدُغَ also, like that of دَمَغَهُ], and inf. n. as<br>\
above, He struck his صُدْغ [or temple]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And صُدِغَ, like عُنِىَ, inf. n. as above, He had<br>\
a complaint of his صُدْغ [or temple]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
صَدَغَهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ He turned him away, or back,<br>\
from the affair. (K. [And so, accord. to Freytag, as from the S, on the authority of As, اصدغه:<br>\
but he has app. taken this from a mistranscription<br>\
in a copy of the S.]) One says, مَا صَدَغَكَ عَنْ<br>\
هٰذَا الأَمْرِ What turned thee away, or back, from<br>\
this affair? (As, S, O:) and صَدَعَكَ also: (S and<br>\
O in art. صدع:) but the former is the better. (O<br>\
in that art.) And اِتَّبَعَ فُلَانٌ بَعِيرَهُ فَمَا صَدَغَهُ i. e.<br>\
[Such a one followed his camel, and] he did not<br>\
turn him aside: this is said when he has taken<br>\
fright, or become refractory, and run away. (As,<br>\
S, O.) And Selemeh is related to have said,<br>\
اِشْتَرَيْتُ سِنَّوْرًا فَلَمْ يَصْدَغْهُنَّ [I bought a cat, and<br>\
he did not drive them away]; meaning the rats,<br>\
or mice. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, فُلَانٌ مَا يَصْدَغُ<br>\
نَمْلَةً Such a one does not kill an ant; (S, K; *)<br>\
by reason of his weakness. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And صَدَغَهُ,<br>\
inf. n. as above, He straightened his, or its, صَدَغ,<br>\
i. e. crookedness, and bending, or inclining. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  صَدَغَ إِلَى الشَّىْءِ, inf. n. صُدُوغٌ, He inclined<br>\
to the thing. (TA.) And صَدَغَ عَنْ طَرِيقِهِ He<br>\
declined from his way, or road. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  صَدُغَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
صَدُغَ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. صَدَاغَةٌ, (S, O,) He (a<br>\
man, S, O,) was, or became, weak. (S, O, K.)<br>\
[See its part. n. صَدِيغٌ.]<br>\
3<br>\
صادغهُ i. q. دَارَاهُ [He treated him with<br>\
gentleness, or blandishment; soothed, coaxed,<br>\
wheedled, or cajoled, him; &amp;c.]: or عَارَضَهُ فِى<br>\
المَشْىِ [he went along over against him]: (K:)<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Abbád says that صَادَغْتُ الرَّجُلَ means دَارَيْتُهُ:<br>\
and he adds, وَهِىَ المُعَارَضَةُ فِى المَشْىِ: (O: [but<br>\
the right reading seems to be أَوْ هِىَ:]) accord. to<br>\
the A, one says, صَادَغْتُهُ فِى المَشْىِ صُدْغِى لِصُدْغِهِ<br>\
[I walked, or went along, with him, my temple<br>\
towards his temple]. (TA.) [See also 1, first<br>\
sentence.]<br>\
صُدْغٌ [The temple; i. e.] the part between the<br>\
eye and the ear; (S, O, K;) the part between the<br>\
outer angle of the eye and the root (أَصْل) of the<br>\
ear; (A, Msb;) the part of the head that slopes<br>\
down to the place of attachment of the jaws; as<br>\
expl. by AZ, it is [from] the place of juncture<br>\
between the لحية [app. a mistranscription for<br>\
لَحْى i. e. jaw, agreeably with the explanation<br>\
next preceding,] and [the main portion of] the<br>\
head, to the part beneath the قَرْن [which is the<br>\
temporal ridge]; (TA;) each of what are termed<br>\
the صُدْغَانِ: (AZ, A, TA:) ISd mentions also<br>\
↓ صُدُغ, as occurring in poetry, and expresses a<br>\
doubt whether it be, or be not, peculiar to poetry:<br>\
(TA:) and sometimes they said سُدْغٌ, with س:<br>\
Ktr says that certain persons of the Benoo-Temeem,<br>\
called Bel&#39;ambar [a contraction of Benu-l-&#39;Ambar],<br>\
change س into ص [or use these two letters indiscriminately] when followed by any of the<br>\
letters ط and ق and غ and خ, whether the latter<br>\
be second or third or fourth; saying سِرَاطٌ and<br>\
صِرَاطٌ, and بَسْطَةٌ and بَصْطَةٌ, and سَيْقَلٌ and صَيْقَلٌ,<br>\
&amp;c.: (S, O:) the pl. is أَصْدَاغٌ (S, O, Msb, TA,<br>\
[in all except the Msb mentioned after the signification expl. in the next sentence, and properly<br>\
a pl. of pauc.,]) and also أَصْدُغٌ [which is probably used only as a pl. of pauc.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And (tropical:)  The hair that hangs down upon the place<br>\
above-mentioned. (S, O, Msb, K.) One says صُدْغٌ<br>\
مُعَقْرَبٌ (tropical:)  [A curled lock of hair hanging down<br>\
upon the temple]. (S, O, TA.)<br>\
صَدَغٌ Crookedness, and bending, or inclining.<br>\
(TA. [See 1, near the end.])<br>\
صُدُغٌ: see صُدْغٌ.<br>\
صَدَاغٌ A mark made with a hot iron upon the<br>\
صُدْغ [or temple, of a camel], (S, O, K, TA,) or,<br>\
as in the A, upon the even part of the صُدْغ,<br>\
lengthwise. (TA.)<br>\
صَدِيغٌ an epithet applied to a child (S, K) In<br>\
the stage extending to his completion of seven<br>\
days: (S:) or that is seven days old: (Mgh, O,<br>\
K:) because his temple becomes firm (يَشْتَدُّ صُدْغُهُ)<br>\
only to this period, (so in the O, [and the like is<br>\
said in the Mgh,]) or because his temples are not<br>\
bound (لَا يُشَدُّ صُدْغَاهُ) save for seven days: (so in<br>\
the TA:) or it may be an instance of فَعِيلٌ in the<br>\
sense of مَفْعُولٌ from صَدَغَهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ meaning<br>\
“ he turned him away, or back, from the thing. ”<br>\
(O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence, perhaps,] Weak. (S, O, K.)<br>\
الأَصْدَغَانِ [The two temporal arteries;] two<br>\
veins beneath the صُدْغَانِ [or two temples], (O,<br>\
K,) which, as is said by As, are always pulsing,<br>\
in everyone in the world: a word having no sing.,<br>\
like as they say of المِذْرَوَانِ. (O.)<br>\
مِصْدَغٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
مِصْدَغَةٌ A pillow, or cushion; (S, O, K;) because placed beneath the صُدْغ [or temple]; also<br>\
pronounced مِسْدَغَةٌ; and sometimes they said<br>\
مِزْدَغَةٌ; (S, O;) and [↓ مِصْدَغٌ and] مِسْدَغٌ and<br>\
مِزْدَغٌ signify the same. (TA in art. سدغ.)<br>\
مَصْدَّغٌ, and its fem.: see what follows.<br>\
مَصْدُوغٌ, A camel marked with the mark termed<br>\
صِدَاغ; as also ↓ مُصَدَّغٌ: (K, * TA:) or the former<br>\
is applied in this sense to a camel, and ↓ مُصَدَّغَةٌ<br>\
in like manner to camels. (ISh, O, TA.)<br>\
