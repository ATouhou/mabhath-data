inf. n. صَرْخَةٌ; and ↓ اصطرخ; [He called or called<br>\

and signifies The raising the voice, calling or<br>\
calling out, crying or crying out: (S, A, L, K:)<br>\
or doing so vehemently: (L, K:) and the calling,<br>\
or crying, for aid, or succour; (A;) which last<br>\
meaning is said to be tropical, but conventionally<br>\
regarded as proper; (MF;) as also صَرِيخٌ, (S,<br>\
TA,) which is likewise an inf. n. of صَرَخَ: (A,<br>\
Mgh:) one says, صَرَخَ, aor.<br>\
صَرُخَ (A, MA, Mgh, L,<br>\

اصرخ He aided, or succoured, another; in<br>\
answer to a call, or cry; (S, A, Mgh, Msb;) as<br>\

verb is said to have a privative effect, so that<br>\
أَصْرَخْتُهُ signifies I made his crying, or vehement<br>\
crying, &amp;c., to cease: (TA:) and ↓ صَارِخَةٌ has<br>\
the signification of the inf. n. of this verb, as an<br>\
inf. n. [or rather quasi-inf. n.] of the measure<br>\
فَاعِلَةٌ; (K;) and ↓ صَرِيخٌ also may have this<br>\

بِامْرَأَتِهِ, meaning, And he was called to aid in<br>\
