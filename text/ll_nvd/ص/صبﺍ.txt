صَبَأَ, (S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
صَبَاَ, (M, K,) inf. n. صُبُوْءٌ,<br>\
(S, M, K, [in the last of which it is implied that<br>\
this verb in all its senses except the last has صَبْءٌ<br>\
also for an inf. n., and likewise صَبُؤَ as a syn.<br>\
form, but this I do not find authorized by any<br>\
other lexicon,]) said of the tush (S, M, K) of a<br>\
camel (S, M) and of a cloven-hoofed animal and<br>\
of a solid-hoofed animal, (M,) and said of a<br>\
cloven hoof, (K, [but this, I doubt not, is a<br>\
mistake, for in the place of صَبَأَ الظِّلْفُ والنَّابُ, the<br>\
reading in the K, I find in the M صَبَأَ نَابُ الظِّلْفِ<br>\
وَالخُفِّ وَالحَافِرِ, and the like in the L,]) It grew<br>\
forth; (M, K;) or its point, or extremity, grew<br>\
forth: (S:) and accord. to the K, it appears that<br>\
↓ اصبأ signifies the same; but this is not the case.<br>\
(TA.) And صَبَأَت said of the ثَنِيَّة [i. e. a central<br>\
incisor] of a boy, It grew forth. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
said of a star, (M, K,) and of the moon, (M,) It<br>\
rose; and so ↓ اصبأ: (M, K:) or تَصْبَأَ النُّجُومُ the<br>\
stars come forth from their places of rising:<br>\
(AO, S:) or صَبَأَتِ النُّجُومُ the stars appeared:<br>\
(TA:) and النَّجْمُ ↓ اصبأ the Pleiades [antonomastically called النجم] rose. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,]<br>\
صَبَأَ, (S, M, K,) or صَبَأَ مِنْ دِينِهِ إِلَى دِينٍ آخَرَ,<br>\
(AO, S, Msb, *) aor.<br>\
صَبَاَ, (M, Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
صُبُوْءٌ (S, M, K) and صَبْءٌ; and صَبُؤَ, (M, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
صَبُاَ, (TA,) inf. n. صُبُوْءَةٌ; (CK [but not in the<br>\
TA nor in my MS. copy of the K];) (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
departed from his religion to another religion;<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K;) like as the stars come forth from<br>\
their place of rising. (AO, S.) And صَبَأَ, (S,)<br>\
or صَبَأَ فِى دِينِهِ, aor.<br>\
صَبَاَ, inf. n. صُبُوْءٌ, (T, TA,) He<br>\
was, or became, a صَابِئ [or Sabian]. (T, S, TA.<br>\
[See صَابِئٌ, below.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And صَبَأَ عَلَيْهِمْ, (S, M,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
صَبَاَ, (S,) inf. n. صَبْءٌ and صُبُوْءٌ, He came forth<br>\
upon them; (S, M;) as also ↓ اصبأ: (M:) and<br>\
accord. to IAar, صَبَأَ عَلَيْهِ he came forth, or went<br>\
forth, upon him, or against him: and he inclined<br>\
against him with enmity: (TA:) or he came, or<br>\
came forth, upon him unexpectedly: whence, he<br>\
says, the word صُبًّا in the saying of the Prophet,<br>\
لَتَعُودُونَّ فِيهَا أَسَاوِدَ صُبًّا, [which see in art. صب,]<br>\
the said word being of the measure فُعَّلًا, [originally صُبَّأً,] and the ء being suppressed: (L in art.<br>\
صب:) and ↓ أَصْبَأَهُمْ signifies he came upon them<br>\
suddenly, not having knowledge of their place.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
-A2-  One says also, صَبَأَ عَلَيْهِمُ العَدُوَّ, (M, * K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
صَبَاَ, inf. n. صَبْءٌ; (M;) as also صَبَعَ; (TA;) He<br>\
guided to them (M, K) the enemy: (K:) mentioned by IAar, from AZ. (TA.) ―<br>\

him, and he did not put (M, K *) his hand (M)<br>\
or his finger (إِصْبَعَهُ K) into it, or upon it: (M,)<br>\
K: [see also صَبَعَ:]) mentioned by IAar. (M.)<br>\
And صَبَأَ فِى الطَّعَامِ, aor.<br>\
صَبُاَ, He [app. a camel]<br>\
put his head into the food: as also صَبَغَ. (O in<br>\
art. صبغ.) And صَبَأَتْ فِيهَا رَأْسَهَا [or فِيهِ, She put<br>\
her head into it]; like صَبَغَتْ. (TA in that art.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَصْبَاَ see the preceding paragraph, in six places.<br>\
صَابِئٌ [part. n. of صَبَأَ: and as such signifying]<br>\
One who departs from his religion to another<br>\
religion. (Msb.) The Arabs used to call the<br>\
Prophet الصَّابِى [for الصَّابِئُ], because he departed<br>\
from the religion of Kureysh to El-Islám; and<br>\
him who entered the religion of El-Islám, مَصْبُوٌّ,<br>\
changing the ء to و; and the Muslims [collectively], الصُّبَاةٌ, as though pl. of الصَّابِىِ, without ء,<br>\
like قُضَاةٌ and غُزَاةٌ pls. of قَاضٍ and غَازٍ. (TA.)<br>\
And [the pl.] الصَّابِئُونَ in the Kur [v. 73, &amp;c.,] is<br>\
said by Zj to mean Those who depart from one<br>\
religion to another. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Then this appellation, صَابِئٌ, was applied to [Any individual of] a<br>\
certain sect of the unbelievers, [the Sabians,] said<br>\
to worship the stars secretly, and openly to profess themselves to belong to the Christians: they<br>\
are called الصَّابِئَةُ and الضَّابِئُونَ: and they assert<br>\
that they are of the religion of Sábi the son of<br>\
Sheyth [or Seth] the son of Adam: their appellation may also be pronounced الصَّابِيُونَ, and thus<br>\
Náfi&#39; read it [in the Kur]: (Msb:) or the<br>\
صَابِئُونَ are a certain class of the people who<br>\
possess revealed scripture: (S:) or a people whose<br>\
religion resembles that of the Christians, except<br>\
that their kibleh is towards the place whence blows<br>\
the [south, or southerly, wind called] جَنُوب:<br>\
(Lth, T, TA:) [or] whose kibleh is from (مِنْ [or<br>\
this may mean some point of]) the place whence<br>\
blows the [north, or northerly, wind called] شَمَال<br>\
at midday: (M, K:) or, accord. to some, their<br>\
kibleh is the Kaabeh: (MF:) and they assert that<br>\
they are of the religion of Noah, (Lth, T, M, K,)<br>\
lyingly: (Lth, T, M:) in the R it is said that<br>\
they are thus called in relation to Sábi the son of<br>\
Lámak [or Lamech], the brother of Noah: Bd<br>\
says, it is said that they are worshippers of the<br>\
angels: and it is said that they are worshippers of<br>\
the stars: and that their appellation is Arabic;<br>\
from صَبَأَ “ he departed from a religion; ” or from<br>\
صَبَا “ he inclined,” because of their inclining from<br>\
truth to falsehood. (MF, TA.)<br>\
