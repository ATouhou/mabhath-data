(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O;) as also ↓ صَمَّعَهَا. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And صومع بِنَأءَهُ He made his building high.<br>\
(Seer, TA.) ―<br>\

صَوْمَعٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
صَوْمَعَةٌ A Christian&#39;s cell, or chamber, (K,<br>\
KL,) for retirement, or seclusion, having a high<br>\
and slender head; (KL;) [the cell of a recluse;]<br>\
a monk&#39;s مَنَار [which, as here used, means likewise<br>\
a cell, or chamber, of the kind described above]:<br>\
(TA:) the صَوْمَعَة of the Christians is thus called<br>\
because it is slender in the head; (S, O, K;) or<br>\
because contracted; (Msb;) or, as As says, from<br>\
the epithet أَصْمَعُ, meaning [that it is] pointed at<br>\
the extremity, [or top,] and contracted: (TA:)<br>\
and it is also called ↓ صَوْمَعٌ: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K:)<br>\
the pl. is صَوَامِعُ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. مِئْذَنَةٌ<br>\
[q. v.]. (Lh, M and K and TA in art. اذن.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And (tropical:)  The upper, or uppermost, part of [a mess<br>\
of] ثَرِيد [or crumbled bread moistened with<br>\
broth]: (K, TA:) and the body thereof: a ثريدة<br>\
[or mess of crumbled bread with broth] is said to<br>\
be thus called, when it is made pointed in its head,<br>\
and made even. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  A بُرْنُس [or<br>\
garment with a pointed hood]: (K, TA:) Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Alee says, (TA,) صَوَامِعُ signifies بَرَانِس; (O,<br>\
TA;) without mentioning a sing. thereof. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  The eagle is thus termed, because<br>\
always upon the highest place to which it can<br>\
ascend. (O, * K, * TA.)<br>\
أَصْمَعُ The small in the ear; (S, Mgh, O, K,<br>\
TA;) of men and of others: (TA:) [see also 1:]<br>\
fem. صَمْعَآءُ; (S, Mgh, O, K, TA;) applied in this<br>\
sense to a woman, and to other than woman;<br>\
(TA;) thus to a she-goat; and such I&#39;Ab held to<br>\
be allowable as a victim for sacrifice; (O, TA;)<br>\
or, applied to a she-goat, whose ear is like that of<br>\
the gazelle, between such as is termed سَكَّآء and<br>\
such as is termed أَذْنَآء; or, accord. to Az, applied<br>\
to a ewe or she-goat, whose ear is little, and<br>\
cleaving to the head: (TA:) [pl. صُمْعٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, The ostrich; because of the smallness of<br>\
his ear, and its cleaving to his head. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And the fem., applied to an ear, Small, or little,<br>\
and contracted towards the head. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
Also, the masc., applied to a كَعْب [as meaning<br>\
a joint of the bones, and particularly an anklejoint, and an ankle-bone, and also a joint, or knot,<br>\
of a cane or reed], Small, or slender, and even.<br>\
(O, K.) A woman is said to be صَمْعَآءُ الكَعْبَيْنِ<br>\
Small, or slender, in the كَبْعَان [i. e. ankle-joints<br>\
or ankle-bones]. (TA.) And dogs are said to be<br>\
صُمْعُ الكُعُوبِ i. e. Small in the كعوب [app.<br>\
meaning joints of the legs, i. e. tarsal and other<br>\
joints]: (S, K:) so too the legs of a wild bull,<br>\
meaning slender, not swollen, in the كُعُوب; even<br>\
and smooth therein; thus in the saying of En-Nábighah Edh-Dhubyánee, describing dogs and<br>\
a [wild] bull:<br>\
فَبَثَّهُنَّ عَلَيْهِ وَاسْتَمَرَّ بِهِ<br>\
صُمْعُ الكُعُوبِ بَرِيْآتٌ مِنَ الحَرَدِ<br>\
[And he (the owner of the dogs) has dispersed<br>\
them (the dogs) against him; and legs (قَوَائِمُ<br>\
being understood) slender and even and smooth in<br>\
the joints, free from the disease that would render<br>\
them unsteady, (such being here meant by الحَرَد,<br>\
which is properly in camels,) have been strong to<br>\
bear him.] (L, TA. [See also De Sacy&#39;s Chrest.<br>\
Arabe, sec. ed., ii. 438-9.]) You say also قَنَاةٌ<br>\
صَمْعَآءُ الكُعُوبِ i. e. [A spear-shaft] even and smooth<br>\

(TA.) And رُمْحٌ أَصْمَعُ الكَعْبِ i. e. A spear<br>\
pointed in the كعب [app. meaning the knot that<br>\
forms its lower extremity]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  أَصْمَعُ<br>\
applied to a feather means Slender in the عَسِيب<br>\
[or shaft]: (O, TA:) العَسِيبُ اللَّطِيفُ in the K is<br>\
a mistake for اللَّطِيفُ العَسِيبِ: (TA:) or the best<br>\
of feathers; (K, TA;) such as is used for feathering<br>\
an arrow, of the kind called ظُهَار [q. v.]: (TA:)<br>\
pl. صُمْعَانٌ, (O, K,) which is said to mean the<br>\
best of the feathers of a bird. (O.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Applied to<br>\
a plant, it means Having fruit come forth that<br>\
has not yet broken open: (O, K:) or, as some<br>\
say, saturated with moisture, and compact: and<br>\
صَمْعَآءُ is said to have this latter meaning applied<br>\
to a plant such as is termed بَقْلَة: (TA:) and the<br>\
same, (i. e. the fem.,) applied to the plant called<br>\
بُهْمَى, that has risen high, (Az, S, O, K,) and<br>\
attained its complete growth, (Az, O, TA,) before<br>\
the bursting open of its pericarps: (S, O, K:)<br>\
[and so as applied to any plant: (see بُسْرٌ:)] or,<br>\
applied to a plant, smooth and round and slender:<br>\
(O, K:) or any calyx (بُرْعُومَة) that has not yet<br>\
opened: (AHn, O, K:) and, applied to the plant<br>\
called بهمى, of which the calyxes have not opened,<br>\
and the awn has not yet appeared: (O:) or, thus<br>\
applied, fresh, or juicy, and not yet burst open:<br>\
or having its fruit, or produce, coming forth upon<br>\
its upper part: accord. to IAar, thus applied, it<br>\
is an intensive epithet, [app. meaning full-grown<br>\
and flourishing,] like جَعْدٌ applied to the صِلِّيَان,<br>\
and أَسْحَمُ applied to the نَصِىّ: (TA:) the pl. is<br>\
صُمْعٌ. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  أَصْمَعُ القَلْبِ means Vigilant,<br>\
and sharp, or acute, in mind: (S, O, K:) and<br>\
قَلْبٌ أَصْمَعُ an intelligent and acute mind: (TA:)<br>\
and الأَصْمَعَانِ the sharp, or acute, (S, O, K,) and<br>\
vigilant (K) mind, (S, O, K,) and the resolute,<br>\
(عَازِم, S, and so in the L,) or prudent, or discreet,<br>\
or intelligent, or firm and sound, (حَازِم, O, K,)<br>\
judgment, or opinion: (S, O, K:) accord. to As,<br>\
أَصْمَعُ applied to the mind (فُؤَاد), and to judgment, or opinion, means عَازِمٌ [expl. above]: and<br>\
رَجُلٌ أَصْمَعُ القَلْبِ means a man of acute intelligence. (TA.) [See also صَمِعٌ.] And one says<br>\
also عَزْمَةٌ صَمْعَآءُ i. e. An effective resolution, or<br>\
determination. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  [It is said that] أَصْمَعُ<br>\
signifies also A sharp sword: (O, K:) this and<br>\
the next two significations are related as on the<br>\
authority of El-Muärrij; but Az says that all that<br>\
has been related as from him is of the things that<br>\
are not to be regarded unless the transmission<br>\
from him prove to be correct. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And One<br>\
that ascends, or rises by degrees, to the most elevated of places. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b10-  And i. q. سَادِرٌ [which<br>\
means In a state of confusion or perplexity, and<br>\
unable to see his right course: &amp;c.: see this latter<br>\
word]. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b11-  And الصَّمْعَآءُ also signifies<br>\
The سَالِفَة [meaning the side of the upper part of<br>\
the neck], (O, K,) and the place of the ear: (O:)<br>\
this is said to be its meaning as used in a verse of<br>\
Abu-n-Nejm, (O, TA,) describing a male ostrich.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
ثَرِيدَةٌ مُصَمَّعَةٌ: see what here follows.<br>\

[A mess of crumbled bread with broth] made<br>\
slender in the head, (S, O, K,) and pointed<br>\
therein. (S, O.)<br>\
