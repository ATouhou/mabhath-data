صَدَقَ, (S, M, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
صَدُقَ, (M, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. صِدْقٌ (S, * M, O, * Msb, K, TA) and صَدْقٌ,<br>\
(M, K,) the former of which is the more chaste,<br>\
(TA,) or the latter is an inf. n. and the former is<br>\
a simple subst., (K,) and تَصْدَاقٌ (M) and مَصْدُوقَةٌ,<br>\
(O, K, TA,) which is one of the [few] inf. ns. of<br>\
the measure مَفْعُولَةٌ, (O, TA,) [or a fem. pass.<br>\
part. n. used as an inf. n. like as is said of its contr.<br>\
مَكْذُوبَةٌ,] he spoke, said, uttered, or told, truth,<br>\
or truly, or veraciously; contr. of كَذَبَ: (Msb:<br>\
[and in like manner it is said in the S and M and<br>\
O and K that صِدْقٌ is the contr. of كَذِبٌ:]) Er-Rághib says that صِدْقٌ and كَذِبٌ are primarily<br>\
in what is said, whether relating to the past or to<br>\
the future, and [in the latter case] whether it be a<br>\
promise or other than a promise; and only in<br>\
what is said in the way of information: but sometimes they are in other modes of speech, such as<br>\
asking a question, and commanding, and supplicating; as when one says, “Is Zeyd in the<br>\
house? ” for this implies information of his being<br>\
ignorant of the state of Zeyd; and when one says,<br>\
“ Make me to share with thee, or to be equal with<br>\
thee,” for this implies his requiring to be made to<br>\
share with the other, or to be made equal with<br>\
him; and when one says, “Do not thou hurt<br>\
me,” for this implies that the other is hurting<br>\
him: صِدْقٌ, he says, is [by implication] the<br>\
agreeing of what is said with what is conceived in<br>\
the mind and with the thing told of, together;<br>\
otherwise it is not complete صِدْق, but may be<br>\
described either as صِدْق or sometimes as صِدْق and<br>\
sometimes as كَذِب according to two different<br>\
points of view; as when one says without believing it, “Mohammad is the Apostle of God,”<br>\
for this may be termed صِدْق because what is told<br>\
is such, and it may be termed كَذِب because it<br>\
is at variance with what the speaker conceives in<br>\
his mind. (TA.) One says, صَدَقَ فِى الحَدِيثِ<br>\
[He spoke truth in the information, or narration].<br>\
(S, O, K.) And صَدَقَهُ i. e. He told him, or informed him, with truth, or veracity, (AHeyth, *<br>\
M, Msb, *) فِى القَوْلِ [in the saying]; for it is<br>\
trans. as well as intrans. (Msb.) And صَدَقَهُ<br>\
الحَدِيثَ (S, O, K, in the CK [erroneously] صَدَّقَ<br>\
فُلانًا الحَدِيثَ) He told him with truth, or veracity,<br>\
the information, or narration; for it is sometimes<br>\
doubly trans. (TA.) And صَدَقَنِى سِنَّ بَكْرِهِ [He<br>\
hath told me truly the age, or as to the age, of his<br>\
youthful camel; or صَدَقَنِى سِنُّ بَكْرِهِ the age of<br>\
his youthful camel has spoken truly to me]: (S,<br>\
O, K:) a prov., (S, O,) expl. in art. بكر [q. v.].<br>\
(K.) And فُلَانٌ لَا يَصْدُقُ أَثَرُهُ and أَثَرَهُ, meaning<br>\
Such a one, when asked, will not tell truly whence<br>\
he comes. (M.) And صَدَقَتْ يَمِينُهُ His oath was,<br>\
or proved, true. (Msb in art. بت.) صَدَقْتُ اللّٰهَ<br>\
حَدِيثًا إِنْ لَمْ أَفْعَلْ كَذَا is an oath of the Arabs,<br>\
meaning لَا صَدَقْتُ الخ [May I not utter truly to<br>\
God a saying, i. e. may I not speak truth to God,<br>\
if I do not such a thing]. (AHeyth, O, K.) One<br>\
says also, صَدَقَهُ النَّصِيحَةَ, and الإِخَآءَ, He rendered<br>\
to him truly, or sincerely, good advice, and<br>\
brotherly affection. (M.) And صَدَ قُوهُمُ القِتَالَ<br>\
(S, M, K, * TA) [They gave them battle earnestly,<br>\
not with a false show of bravery; as is implied<br>\
in the S, and M, and K; i. e.] they advanced<br>\
against them boldly in fight: (M, TA:) and in<br>\
like manner, صَدَقُوا فِى القِتَالِ they advanced<br>\
boldly in fight: or, accord. to Er-Rághib, the<br>\
former means they gave them battle so as to fulfil<br>\
their duty: and hence, in the Kur [xxxiii. 23],<br>\
رِجَالٌ صَدَقُوا مَا عَاهَدُوا اللّٰهَ عَلَيْهِ, Men who fulfilled<br>\
the covenant that they had made with God. (TA.)<br>\
And صَدَقَ اللِّقَآءَ, inf. n. صِدْقٌ, He was firm, or<br>\
steady, in encounter, or conflict. (M, TA.) And<br>\
صَدَقَ ظَنِّى My opinion was, or proved, true, or<br>\
correct, like as one says [in the contrary case],<br>\
كَذَبَ: (Er-Rághib, TA:) whence, in the Kur<br>\
[xxxiv. 19], وَلَقَدْ صَدَقَ عَلَيْهِمْ إِبْلِيسُ ظَنَّهُ, meaning<br>\
فِى ظَنِّهِ [i. e. And assuredly Iblees was, or<br>\
proved to be, correct in his opinion that he had<br>\
formed against them]: but some read ↓ صَدَّقَ,<br>\
meaning, as Fr says, حَقَّقَ [i. e. Iblees proved, or<br>\
found, to be true, his opinion &amp;c.]. (TA.) And<br>\
صَدَقَتْهُ نَفْسُهُ His soul [told him truth; meaning,]<br>\
diverted him, or hindered him, or held him back,<br>\
from an undertaking, causing him to imagine<br>\
himself unable to prosecute it. (TA in art. كذب.)<br>\
And صَدَقَ الصُّبْحُ [The dawn shone clearly]. (S in<br>\
art. سقط.) [And one says of a word or the like,<br>\
يَصْدُقُ عَلَى كَذَا, meaning It applies correctly to<br>\
such a thing.] ―<br>\
-b2-  صَدَقَ الوَحْشِىُّ: see 2, near the<br>\
end.<br>\
2<br>\
صدّقهُ, (S, M, O, &amp;c.,) inf. n. تَصْدِيقٌ, contr.<br>\
of كَذَّبَهُ. (O, * K.) [This explanation implies<br>\
several meanings here following.] He attributed,<br>\
or ascribed, to him truth, veracity, or the speaking<br>\
truth. (Msb.) And He said to him, “Thou hast<br>\
spoken truth. ” (Msb.) He accepted, or admitted,<br>\
[or assented to, or believed,] what he said: (M:)<br>\
you say, صدّقهُ فِى حَدِيثِهِ [He accepted, &amp;c.,<br>\
what he said in his information, or narration]:<br>\
(S:) and you say صدّق بِلِسَانِهِ [He assented to the<br>\
truth of what was said with his tongue]; as well<br>\
as بِقَلْبِهِ [with his heart, or mind]. (T in art.<br>\
اَمن.) He held him to be a speaker of truth.<br>\
(MA.) [He found him to be a speaker of truth.<br>\
He, or it, proved him to be a speaker of truth;<br>\
verified him; or confirmed the truth of what he<br>\
said: see an ex. in a verse cited voce بَيْنٌ.] He<br>\
found it (an opinion) to be true, or veritable.<br>\
(Ksh and Bd and Jel, in xxxiv. 19.) He verified<br>\
it; confirmed its truth; or proved it to be true,<br>\
or veritable; i. e. an opinion [&amp;c.]; syn. حَقَّقَهُ:<br>\
(Ksh and Bd, ibid.:) one says, صَدَّقَ الخَبَرَ الخُبْرُ<br>\
[The trial, proof, or test, verified the information].<br>\
(S in art. خبر.) See 1, near the end. In the<br>\
saying in the Kur [xxxix. 34], وَالَّذِى جَآءَ بِالصِّدْقِ<br>\
وَصَدَّقَ بِهِ, [which seems to be best rendered But<br>\
he who hath brought the truth and he who hath<br>\
accepted it as the truth, (see كَذَّبَ بِالأَمْرِ,)] &#39;Alee<br>\
the son of Aboo-Tálib is related to have said that<br>\
by الذى جآء بالصدق is meant Mohammad; and<br>\
by الذى صدّق به, Aboo-Bekr: or, as some say,<br>\
Gabriel and Mohammad [are meant by the former<br>\
and the latter respectively]: or by the former,<br>\
Mohammad; and by the latter, [every one of]<br>\
the believers: (M:) accord. to Er-Rághib, by<br>\
وصدّق به is meant and hath found, or proved, to<br>\
be true (حَقَّقَ) that which he hath brought by<br>\
word, by that which he hath aimed at (بِمَا تَحَرَّاهُ)<br>\
by deed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  صدّق is also said to signify<br>\
He said, “This thing is the truth; ” like حَقَّقَ.<br>\
(TA in art. حق.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And this verb also denotes<br>\
المُبَالَغَةُ فِى الصِّدْقِ: thus in the saying,<br>\
صَدَّقَتْ فِيهِمْ ظُنُونِى<br>\
[My opinions respecting them were, or proved to<br>\
be, very true or correct]. (Ksh, in xxxiv. 19.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
صدّق الوَحْشِىُّ, (O, K, TA,) or ↓ صَدَقَ, (so in a<br>\
copy of the M,) (tropical:)  The wild animal ran without<br>\
looking aside, when charged upon, or attacked:<br>\
(M, O, K, TA:) mentioned by IDrd. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  صَدَّقَهُمْ He exacted from them the poor-rate.<br>\
(TA. [See صَدَقَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5.<br>\
3<br>\
صَادَقْتُهُ, (M,) inf. n. مُصَادَقَةٌ (S, M, O, K)<br>\
and صِدَاقٌ, (M, O, K,) the latter like كِتَابٌ,<br>\
(TA, [in the CK erroneously written صَداق,]) I<br>\
acted, or associated, with him as a friend, or as<br>\
a true, or sincere, friend. (S, * M, O, * K. *) [See<br>\
also 6.]<br>\
4<br>\
اصدق المَرْأَةَ He named for the woman a<br>\
صَدَاق [or dowry]: (S, M, * O, K:) or he gave<br>\
her her صَدَاق: (M, * Msb:) or he appointed her,<br>\
or assigned her, a صَدَاق, on taking her as his<br>\
wife: (TA:) and he married her, or took her as<br>\
his wife, on the condition of his giving her a<br>\
صَدَاق. (Msb.) And sometimes this verb is<br>\
doubly trans.; whence, in a trad., مَا ذَا تُصْدِقُهَا<br>\
فَقَالَ إِزَارِى [It was said, “What is it that thou<br>\
meanest for her, or givest her, as her dowry? ” and<br>\
he said, “My waist-wrapper ”]. (Mgh.)<br>\
5<br>\
تصدّق عَلَيْهِ He gave him (i. e. the poor,<br>\
Mgh, Msb) what is termed صَدَقَة, (M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) meaning [an alms, or] what is given for<br>\
the sake of God, (M,) or what is given with the<br>\
desire of obtaining a recompense from God:<br>\
(M, * Mgh:) and عليه ↓ صَدَّقَ signifies the same;<br>\
(M, TA;) and in this sense صدّق is [said by<br>\
some to be] used in the Kur lxxv. 31. (TA.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [xii. 88], وَتَصَدَّقْ عَلَيْنَا: (TA:)<br>\
or this means (assumed tropical:)  And do thou confer a favour<br>\
upon us by giving that which is [not like the<br>\
mean merchandise that we have brought, but of<br>\
middling quality,] between good and bad. (M.)<br>\
One says, تَصَدَّقْتُ بِكَذَا, meaning I gave such a<br>\
thing as a صَدَقَة. (Msb.) See an ex. voce شِقٌّ.<br>\
The saying, in a trad., إِنَّ اللّٰهَ تَصَدَّقَ عَلَيْكُمْ بِثُلُثِ<br>\
أَمْوَالِكُمْ, meaning (tropical:)  [Verily God] hath conferred<br>\
a favour [upon you by giving you a third of your<br>\
possessions to bequeath to whom ye will], if<br>\
correct, is tropical. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said by Ibn-Es-Seed, on the authority of AZ and IJ, and<br>\
mentioned by IAmb, that تصدّق signifies also<br>\
He asked, or begged, for what is termed صَدَقَة<br>\
[or alms]: but Fr and As and others disallow the<br>\
beggar&#39;s being called مُتَصَدِّق: (Az, TA:) IKt<br>\
says that the verb is improperly used in this sense<br>\
by the vulgar: (Msb:) [and accord. to J and<br>\
Sgh,] one says, مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ يَسْأَلُ, and one should<br>\
not say يَتَصَدَّقُ. (S, O.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَصَادُقٌ signifies The acting, or associating,<br>\
as friends, or as true, or sincere, friends, one with<br>\
another. (K. [See also 3.]) And I. q. صِدْقٌ:<br>\
(TA:) [or rather mutual صِدْق; contr. of تَكَاذُبٌ:]<br>\
one says, تَصَادَقَا فِى الحَدِيثِ and فِى المَوَدَّةِ (S,<br>\
O, TA) They were true, or sincere, each to the<br>\
other, in information, or narration, and in love,<br>\
or affection; contr. of تَكَاذَبَا. (O, TA.)<br>\
صَدْقٌ is an inf. n. of صَدَقَ [q. v.]: (M, K:) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
and is used as an epithet, applied to a man &amp;c.:<br>\
(S, M, O, K, TA:) [and] ↓ صِدْقٌ [also, if not a<br>\
mistranscription for صَدْقٌ,] is an inf. n. used as an<br>\
epithet, applied to a man and to a woman: (so in<br>\
a copy of the M and in the TA:) [it is said that]<br>\
the former signifies Hard, (S, M, O, Msb,)<br>\
applied to a spear, (S, M, O,) and to other things:<br>\
(M:) or even, or straight; (S, O;) or it signifies<br>\
thus also, applied to a spear, and to a sword:<br>\
(M:) or hard and even or straight, applied to a<br>\
spear, (K, TA,) and to a man, (K,) or to the<br>\
latter as meaning hard: or, as IB says, on the<br>\
authority of IDrst, it is not from hardness, but<br>\
means combining those qualities that are commended; and it is applied to a spear as meaning<br>\
long and pliant and hard, and the like; and to a<br>\
man, and to a woman likewise [without ة, but see<br>\
what follows], as meaning true in hardness and<br>\
strength and goodness; for, IDrst says, if it meant<br>\
hard, one would say حَجَرٌ صَدْقٌ and حَدِيدٌ صَدْقٌ,<br>\
which one does not: (TA:) and, applied to anything, (O, K, TA,) it means complete, or perfect,<br>\
(Kh, O, K, TA,) thus applied to a man, (TA,)<br>\
such as is commended; (O;) fem. with ة, (O, K,<br>\
TA,) applied to a woman: (O:) the pl. is صُدْقٌ,<br>\
applied to a company of men, (S, O, K,) and<br>\
صُدُقٌ (K) and صَدْقُونَ, so applied, and صَدْقَاتٌ<br>\
applied to women: (O, K:) and Ru-beh says,<br>\
describing asses,<br>\
مَقْذُوذَةُ الآذَانِ صَدْقَاتُ الحَدَقْ<br>\
meaning [Rounded, as though pared, in the ears,]<br>\
penetrating in the eyes; (O, TA;) which is [said<br>\
to be] tropical. (TA.) صَدْقٌ signifies also Firm,<br>\
or steady, in encounter, or conflict: (M:) or one<br>\
says صَدْقُ اللِّقَآءِ, applying this epithet to a man,<br>\
(S, O, K, TA,) meaning thus: (TA:) and صَدْقُ<br>\
النَّظَرِ [firm, or steady, in look]. (S, O, K, TA.<br>\
[Said in the TA to be tropical.])<br>\
صِدْقٌ is an inf. n. of صَدَقَ [q. v.]: (M, K, &amp;c.:)<br>\
or a simple subst., (K,) signifying [Truth;<br>\
veracity; or] agreement of what is said with what<br>\
is conceived in the mind and with the thing told<br>\
of, together; otherwise it is not complete صِدْق,<br>\
as expl. above in the first paragraph of this art.<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also syn. with شِدَّةٌ<br>\
[meaning Hardness; firmness, compactness, or<br>\
soundness; strength, power, or force; vigour,<br>\
robustness, sturdiness, or hardiness; and courage,<br>\
bravery, or firmness of heart]: (K, TA: [in the<br>\
latter of which it is said to be tropical; but this is<br>\
evidently not the case accord. to the O, in which<br>\
it is said that it radically denotes قُوَّةٌ (i. e.<br>\
strength, force, &amp;c.,) in a saying &amp;c.: in the K<br>\
it is implied by the context that it is syn. with<br>\
شِدَّة when used as the complement of a prefixed<br>\
n. in instances mentioned in what here follows:<br>\
but Sgh says, more correctly,]) a noun signifying<br>\
anything to which goodness is attributed is prefixed to صِدْق, governing it in the gen. case; so<br>\
that one says (O) رَجُلُ صِدْقٍ (Sb, M, O, K) [A<br>\
man of good nature or disposition or character<br>\
&amp;c.], contr. of رَجُلُ سَوْءٍ; (Sb, M;) and صَدِيقُ<br>\
صِدْقٍ [a friend of good nature &amp;c.]; (O, K;)<br>\
and likewise اِمْرَأَةُ صِدْقٍ [a woman of good nature<br>\
&amp;c.]; (K;) and in like manner also حِمَارُ صِدْقٍ<br>\
[an ass of a good kind]; (Sb, M, K;) and ثَوْبُ<br>\
صِدْقٍ [a garment, or piece of cloth, of good<br>\
quality]. (Sb, M.) The saying in the Kur [x.<br>\
93], (O,) وَلَقَدْ بَوَّأْنَا بَنِى اِسْرَائِيلَ مُبَوَّأَ صِدْقٍ means<br>\
And verily we assigned to the Children of Israel<br>\
a good place of abode. (O, K.) ―<br>\

O, Msb, K) to the poor (S, O, Msb) for the sake<br>\
of God, (M, K,) or to obtain a recompense from<br>\
God; (M, * Mgh, K; *) a portion which a man<br>\
gives forth from his property by way of propitiation, [to obtain the favour of God,] like<br>\
زَكَاةٌ, except that the former is primarily applied<br>\
to such as as is supererogatory, and the latter to such<br>\
as is obligatory: but it is said to be applied to<br>\
such as is obligatory [i. e. to the زَكَاة, q. v.,<br>\
meaning the poor-rate, which is the portion, or<br>\
amount, of property, that is given therefrom, as<br>\
the due of God, by its possessor, to the poor,<br>\
according to a fixed rate,] when the person who<br>\
does so aims at conformity with the truth in his<br>\
deed: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [in this latter sense,<br>\
which is indicated in the S and O &amp;c., and more<br>\
plainly in the M, it is very frequently used:] and<br>\
thus it is used in the Kur ix. 104, and in like<br>\
manner its pl. in ix. 60: (Er-Rághib, TA:) the<br>\
pl. is صَدَقَاتٌ. (S, M, O, Msb.) It is said in a<br>\
trad., لَا صَدَقَةَ فِى الإِبِلِ الجَارَّةِ [There is no poorrate in the case of working camels], because they<br>\
are the riding-camels of the people; for the poorrate is in the case of pasturing camels, exclusively<br>\
of the working. (S in art. جر.) ―<br>\

ذَاتُ تَصْدِيقٍ: (M:) or it signifies دَائِمُ التَّصْدِيقِ<br>\
[i. e. always مُصَدِّق in one or another or all of the<br>\
senses assigned to this word above: it may be<br>\
correctly rendered eminently, or always, veracious: and eminently, or always, accepting, or<br>\
confirming, the truth]: and it may mean one<br>\
who verifies his saying by deed, or act: (S:) it is<br>\
said in the “ Mufradát ” [of Er-Rághib] that it<br>\
has the first of the meanings expl. in this paragraph: or rather means, one who never lies: or<br>\
rather, one by whom lying cannot be practised<br>\
because of his habitual veracity: or rather, one<br>\
who is true in his saying and his belief, and who<br>\
confirms his truth by his deed, or acting. (TA.)<br>\
صَادِقٌ Speaking, saying, uttering, or telling,<br>\
truth, or truly, or veraciously; true in respect of<br>\
speech &amp;c., or veracious. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  صِدْقٌ<br>\
صَادِقٌ is a phrase like شِعْرٌ شَاعِرٌ, meaning Eminent,<br>\
and exalted, veracity. (M, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  And حَمْلَةٌ<br>\
صَادِقَةٌ [A charge, or an assault, made with earnestness, not with a false show of bravery,] is like<br>\
the saying [in the contr. case] حَمْلَةٌ كَاذِبَةٌ. (M,<br>\
TA: * said in the latter to be tropical.) See also<br>\
مَصْدَق, in two places. ―<br>\
-b4-  One says also تَمْرٌ صَادِقُ<br>\
الحَلَاوَةِ, meaning Very sweet dates. (IDrd, O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And بَرْدٌ صَادِقٌ Vehement, or intense, cold.<br>\

الصَّيْدَقُ The small star cleaving to the middle<br>\
one of [those called] بَنَاتُ نَعْشٍ الكُبْرَى [which<br>\
compose the tail of Ursa Major]; (Kr, M, TA;)<br>\
[i. e. the star called السُّهَا, q. v.; for] it is said<br>\
that the first of بنات نعش الكبرى, that is at the<br>\
extremity thereof, is named القَائِدُ; and the second<br>\
is العَنَاقُ, and by the side of it is a small star<br>\
named السُّهَا and الصَّيْدَقُ; and the third is الحَوَرُ:<br>\
(O:) or, accord. to AA, (O, TA,) the pole-star<br>\
(القُطْبُ). (O, K, TA. [But this is strange; and<br>\
the more so as it is added in the K that it is expl.<br>\
in art. قود; for the explanation in that art. (though<br>\
not free from obvious mistakes) identifies الصَّيْدَقُ<br>\
with السُّهَا.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, (K,) accord. to Sh, (O,<br>\
TA,) it signifies الأَمِينُ [The trusted, trusted in,<br>\
or confided in, &amp;c.]. (O, K. [But it is added in<br>\
the O that Sh cites a verse of Umeiyeh Ibn-Abi-<br>\
s-Salt in which الأَمِينُ is applied as an epithet to<br>\
the star called الصَيدق.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, (K,) accord. to<br>\
some, as AA says, (O,) it signifies The king.<br>\

means He did it after the affair, or case, had<br>\
become manifest to him. (IDrd, O, K, TA.)<br>\
صُنْدُوقٌ, mentioned in this art. in the S and<br>\
Msb: see art. صندق.<br>\
أَصْدَقُ [More, and most, true or veracious].<br>\
One says أَصْدَقُ مِنْ قَطَاةٍ [More veracious than<br>\
a katáh]; because the bird thus called cries<br>\
قَطَا قَطَا; [thus telling where it is to be found;]<br>\
its name being imitative of its cry: (Meyd, and<br>\
TA in art. قطو:) hence it is called by the Arabs<br>\
↓ الصَّدُوقُ: the saying is a prov. (Meyd.)<br>\
ذُو مَصْدَقٍ, (JK, S, M, O,) with fet-h, (S,) or<br>\
↓ ذُو مِصْدَقٍ like مِنْبَر, (K,) applied to a man,<br>\
(JK, M,) [i. e.] applied to a courageous man,<br>\
(S, O, K,) means الحَمْلَةِ ↓ صَادِقُ [Earnest, not<br>\
making a false show of bravery, in the charge, or<br>\
assault]; (JK, S, M, O, K;) or courageous [in<br>\
the charge, or assault]: (JK:) مَصَادِقُ, occurring<br>\
in a verse of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, may be for ذَوُو<br>\
مَصَادِقَ; or it may be an anomalous pl. of صِدْقٌ<br>\
[used as an epithet], like مَلَامِحُ and مَشَابِهُ [pls.<br>\
of لَمْحَةٌ and شَبَهٌ]. (M.) Also, (S, M, O, K,)<br>\
applied to a horse, (M,) [i. e.] applied to a fleet<br>\
and excellent horse, (S, O,) in like manner, (M,)<br>\
meaning الجَرْىِ ↓ صَادِقُ [Earnest in running];<br>\
(S, O, K;) as though fulfilling his promise of<br>\
running: (S, O: [said in the TA to be tropical:])<br>\
Khufáf Ibn-Nudbeh says,<br>\
إِذَا مَا اسْتَحَمَّتْ أَرْضُهُ مِنْ سَمَائِهِ<br>\
جَرَى وَهْوَ مَوْدُوعٌ وَوَاعِدُ مَصْدَقِ<br>\
meaning When his hoofs are wetted with the<br>\
sweat of his upper parts, he runs, being left to<br>\
himself, not beaten nor chidden, and a fulfiller of<br>\
his promise to do his utmost. (S, O.) And sometimes it is applied to an opinion, in like manner<br>\
[as meaning True, or sincere]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَصْدَقٌ<br>\
also signifies Hardness. (Th, M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also i. q.<br>\
حَدٌّ [as meaning The edge of a sword]: (TA:) [in<br>\
a copy of the M written جِدّ, which I think an<br>\
evident mistake; for it is added,] and it is said to<br>\
have this meaning in a verse of Dureyd Ibn-Es-<br>\
Simmeh [relating to a sword]. (M, TA.)<br>\
مِصْدَق: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مُصَدَّقٌ A man from whom the poor-rate (صَدَقَة)<br>\
of his cattle is exacted. (TA.)<br>\
مُصَدِّقٌ One who accepts, admits, assents to, or<br>\
believes, another in his information, or narration.<br>\
(S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The exactor, or collector, (S,<br>\
M, O, Msb, K, TA,) of the صَدَقَات, (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K, TA,) i. e. (TA) of the حُقُوق [or dues, meaning<br>\
poor-rates], (M, TA,) of the cattle, (Msb,) or of<br>\
the sheep or goats, (S, M, O, TA,) and of the<br>\
camels, (M, O, TA,) for the persons to whom<br>\
pertain the shares [thereof]. (TA.)<br>\
مُصَّدِّقٌ: see مُتَصَدِّقٌ.<br>\
مِصْدَاقٌ A thing that confirms, or proves, the<br>\
truth of a thing: (S, K:) [and] a verbal evidence<br>\
of the truth, or veracity, of a man. (Har p. 106.)<br>\
One says, هٰذَا مِصْدَاقُ هٰذَا This is what confirms,<br>\
or proves, the truth of this. (S.) And شَىْءٌ لَيْسَ<br>\
لَهُ مِصْدَاقٌ [A thing having nothing to verify it].<br>\
(IAar, TA in art. برق.)<br>\
مَصْدُوقَةٌ [see 1, near the beginning]. One says<br>\
لَيْسَ لِحَمْلَتِهِ مَصْدُوقَةٌ [meaning There is no earnestness attributable to his charge, or assault];<br>\
like as one says [in the contr. case], ليس لَهَا مَكْذُوبَةٌ.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
مُتَصَدِّقٌ One who gives what is termed صَدَقَة<br>\
[meaning alms]: (S, O, Msb, K:) accord. to Kh,<br>\
it means thus, and also one who asks [alms]; (O,<br>\
TA;) and IAmb says the like; but Az says that<br>\
the skilful of the grammarians disallow this; and<br>\
thus say Fr and As and others: (TA:) [J, also,<br>\
and Sgh and Fei, say that] it has only the former<br>\
meaning: (S, O, Msb:) it is also pronounced<br>\
↓ مُصَّدِّقٌ, by substitution [of ص for ت] and incorporation [of one ص into the other]; (S, * O, *<br>\
Msb, K; *) and this pronunciation of the pl. both<br>\
masc. and fem. occurs in the Kur lvii. 17, (S, O,<br>\
K,) where Ibn-Ketheer and Aboo-Bekr, differing<br>\
from others, read without teshdeed to the ص. (O.)<br>\
