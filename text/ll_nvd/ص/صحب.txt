TA,) in the Kur [xxi. 44], (TA,) means (tropical:)  Nor<br>\

from us, (A, TA,) as expl. by Zj; (TA;) and<br>\
preserved in safety: (A:) or, accord. to Katádeh,<br>\

↓ صَاحَبَ, as is implied by an explanation of its<br>\

(A,) one says also, اِسْتَصْعَبَ تُمَّ اسْتَصْحَبَ (tropical:)  [He<br>\

tractable, submissive, or obsequious]: (A, TA:)<br>\

Hence, لَهُ صُحْبَةٌ, often occurring in biographies as<br>\

companionship of the Apostle, or in company with<br>\
the Apostle. Hence also] one says, حَمَلْتُ الكِتَابَ<br>\
صُحْبَتِى (assumed tropical:)  [I carried the book with me]. (Msb.)<br>\
صُحْبَةُ السَّفِينَةِ [The companionship of the ship] is<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  See also صَاحِبٌ, of which it is a quasi-pl. n.<br>\
[الصَّحَابَةُ is commonly applied to The Companions<br>\
of the Prophet:] ↓ صَحَابِىٌّ [is the n. un., meaning<br>\
a Companion of the Prophet; and] is conventionally applied to one who saw Mohammad, and<br>\

therefore you may not say, زَيْدٌ صَاحِبٌ عَمْرًا;<br>\
(TA;) [i. e.] it is not used as an act. part. n., but<br>\
as a subst., like وَالِدٌ; (Ham p. 32:) the pl., (S,<br>\
Msb,) or term applied to a pl. number, (A, K,<br>\
TA,) is ↓ صَحْبٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) a pl. like رَكْبٌ<br>\

pl. like جِيَاعٌ of جَائِعٌ, (S,) and صِحَابَةٌ, (A, K,)<br>\

analogy, as an affix to the pl. صِحَابٌ characteristic<br>\
of the fem. gender, (TA,) and ↓ صَحَابَةٌ, (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K,) which is more common than صِحَابَةٌ,<br>\
(TA,) but the only instance of فَعَالَةٌ as the pl.<br>\
measure of a word of the measure فَاعِلٌ, (L, TA,)<br>\
or originally an inf. n., (S,) or not so, but a<br>\
quasi-pl. n., though written like the inf. n. [that<br>\
is said to be its original], (from a marginal note<br>\
in a copy of the S,) and ↓ صُحْبَةٌ, (S, A,) a pl.<br>\
like فُرْهَةٌ of فَارِهٌ, (S, TA,) or [rather] a quasi-pl.<br>\
n.: (TA:) the fem. is صَاحِبَةٌ, and its pl. is<br>\
صَوَاحِبُ and صَوَاحِبَاتٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) the latter<br>\

enticers to lewdness]; or, as some relate it,<br>\
صَوَاحِبَاتُ يُوسُفَ: (Mgh:) the dim. of صَاحِبٌ is<br>\
↓ صُوَيْحِبٌ (A) [and that of صَاحِبَهٌ is ↓ صُوَيْحِبَةٌ].<br>\
يَاصَاحِ for يَاصَاحِبِى [O my companion, &amp;c.,]<br>\
is the only allowable instance of such curtailing<br>\
of a prefixed noun, related as heard from the<br>\
Arabs. (S, TA.) One says, فُلَانٌ صَاحِبُ صِدْقٍ<br>\
[Such a one is a good companion, &amp;c.]. (A, *<br>\
TA.) [And صَاحِبُ جَيْشِ The commander of an<br>\
