صَكَّهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
صَكُ3َ, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
صَكٌّ, (Mgh, * Msb, TA,) He struck him, or it:<br>\
(S, Mgh, O:) or he struck him, or it, vehemently,<br>\
with a broad thing; or in a general sense, (K,<br>\
TA,) with anything whatever: (TA:) or he<br>\
slapped him with his hand, i. e. struck him with<br>\
his expanded hand, (Msb,) like لَطَمَهُ, (TA in art.<br>\
لطث, &amp;c.,) upon the back of his neck, and upon<br>\
his face. (Msb.) Hence, in the Kur [li. 29],<br>\
فَصَكَّتْ وَجْهَهَا (S, TA) And she slapped her face<br>\
with her hand; syn. لَطَمَتْهُ. (Jel.) And صَكَّ<br>\
البَازِى صَيْدَهُ The hawk, or falcon, struck his prey<br>\
with his foot, and so cast it down. (Ham p. 799.)<br>\
And [hence, app.,] one says, خُذْ هٰذَا أَوَّلَ صَكٍّ,<br>\
meaning أَوَّلَ مَا أَصُكُّ بِهِ [Take thou this on my<br>\
first striking with it]: and so أَوَّلَ صَوْكٍ (O,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He pushed him, or thrust him;<br>\
(As, TA;) like دَكَّهُ and لَكَّهُ. (TA in art. دك.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And صَكَّ البَابَ He shut, or closed the door:<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K:) or he locked the door. (Lth, O,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A2-  And صَكَّ, aor. and inf. n. as above, He<br>\
wrote what is termed a صَكّ [expl. below].<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A3-  صَكِكْتَ, (S, O, K,) like مَلِلْتَ, (K,)<br>\
third pers. صَككَ, (MA, in which it is mentioned<br>\
as said of an ass,) [and it is also implied in the<br>\
TA that the third pers. is صَكِكَ, like لَحِحَتْ<br>\
said of the eye, and some other instances, which<br>\
are extr.,] a verb of the class of تَعِبَ, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. صَكَكٌ, (S, Mgh, * O, Msb, K, TA,) [in the<br>\
CK صَكِيكًا is erroneously put for صَكَكًا, and it<br>\
seems from what follows that صَكٌّ is also an inf. n.<br>\
like صَكَكٌ,] Thou wast knock-kneed: (S, O,<br>\
Msb:) or thou hadst a colliding (اِضْطِرَاب) of the<br>\
knees, and [when used in relation to an ostrich or<br>\
a horse or the like] of the عُرْقُوبَانِ [which evidently means here, as in many other instances,<br>\
the hocks]: (K:) [for] the verb is used in relation<br>\
to a man, (S, O, K, TA,) and to other than man:<br>\
(TA: [and the same is implied in the S and O,<br>\
as is shown voce أَصَكُّ:]) صَكَكٌ [sometimes<br>\
particularly] signifies the colliding of the knees<br>\
[or of the hocks] in running, so that it makes a<br>\
mark, or scar, upon each of them: (TA:) [and it<br>\
is said that] this word, (Mgh,) or صَكٌّ, (TA,<br>\
[perhaps a mistranscription for صَكَكٌ,]) signifies<br>\
the colliding of the عُرْقُوبَانِ. (Mgh, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
صاكّهُ [He struck him, or it; or struck him,<br>\
or it, vehemently, with a broad thing, or with<br>\
anything; or slapped him with his hand; being<br>\
struck, &amp;c., by him]. (Ham p. 313.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِصْطَكَّا They (two men, O, TA, and two<br>\
bodies, TA) struck each other. (O, TA.) One<br>\
says, تَصْطَكُّ رُكْبَتَاهُ [His two knees collide, or<br>\
knock together]. (S, O, Msb. *) And اِصْطَكُّوا<br>\
بِالسُّيُوفِ They struck one another with the swords.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
صَكٌّ inf. n. of صَكَّ. (Mgh, * Msb, TA.)<br>\

Pers. جَك, (O,) or چَكْ; (TA;) a debenture, or<br>\
written acknowledgement of a debt (Mgh, Msb)<br>\
of money or property, or of some other thing:<br>\
(Mgh:) and a written statement of a commercial<br>\
transaction, purchase or sale, transfer, bargain,<br>\
contract, or the like: (Msb, TA:) i. q. سِجِلٌّ [in<br>\
this last sense or in the senses next following]: (S<br>\
and TA in art. سجل:) a سِجِلّ of a قَاضِى [i. e.<br>\
a sealed, or signed and sealed, statement of a<br>\
judicial decision; a judicial record; or the record<br>\
of a judge, in which his sentence is written]:<br>\
(KL:) and a written order for the payment of<br>\
subsistence-money, or of a stipend, salary, pension,<br>\
or allowance; which some persons used to sell,<br>\
but the selling of which is forbidden: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَصُكٌّ and [of mult.] صِكَاكٌ<br>\
and صُكُوكٌ. (S, O, Msb, K.) [Hence,] لَيْلَةُ الصَّكِّ<br>\
The night of the middle [of the month] of Shaa-<br>\
bán; because in it are written the صِكَاك of the<br>\
allowances of subsistence [of individuals]: also<br>\
called لَيْلَةُ البَرَآءَةِ. (O, TA.) [Hence also] صَكُّ<br>\
المُسَافِرِ The traveller&#39;s pass, given him to prevent<br>\
any one&#39;s offering opposition to him. (A and Mgh<br>\
in art. جوز.)<br>\
صَكَّةٌ The vehemence of the midday-heat in<br>\
summer: (K:) or the most vehement heat of<br>\
midday in summer: (S:) and it is prefixed to<br>\
عُمَىّ: (K:) one says, لَقِيُتُه صَكَّةَ عُمَىٍّ, (S, O,) a<br>\
prov., meaning I met him in the most vehement<br>\
heat of midday in summer when the heat almost<br>\
blinded by its vehemence: (Lh, O, TA:) for عُمَىّ<br>\
is said to be an abbreviated dim. of أَعْمَى: (S, O,<br>\
TA:) and by it is said to be meant the gazelle,<br>\
because he is dazzled and confounded in the<br>\
midday-heats of summer, and knocks against the<br>\
thing that is before him: some say, صَكَّةَ حُمَىٍّ,<br>\
from حَمِيَتِ الشَّمْسُ: and some assert that عُمَىّ<br>\
means the heat, itself: (O, TA:) or it is the<br>\
name of a certain man [as will be found expl. in<br>\
art. عمى, with variations of this saying]. (S, O,<br>\
K, TA.)<br>\
صُكَاكٌ The air [or atmosphere, between heaven<br>\
and earth]; like سُكَاكٌ; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K;) a<br>\
dial. var. of the latter word. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.)<br>\

measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ;<br>\
[lit.] meaning one who is struck much, or often,<br>\
because deemed weak. (TA.)<br>\
صَكَّاكٌ [A writer of the statements termed صِكَاك,<br>\
pl. of صَكٌّ: or, accord. to Golius, as on the<br>\
authority of Meyd, an actuary, who commits to<br>\
writing the sentences of the judge].<br>\
أَصَكُّ Knock-kneed: (S, O, Msb:) or having a<br>\
colliding (اِضْطِرَاب) of the knees, and [when used<br>\
in relation to an ostrich or a horse or the like] of<br>\
the عُرْقُوبَانِ [which evidently means here, as in<br>\
many other instances, the hocks]; as also ↓ مِصَكٌّ;<br>\
(K;) which latter [in this sense is rare, and is<br>\
written in the CK مَصَكٌّ, but] is with kesr to the<br>\
م: (TA:) thus applied to a man; (S, O, K, TA;)<br>\
and to other than man; (TA;) [i. e.] applied<br>\
also to a horse; (O;) and to an ostrich, because<br>\
he is long in step, long-legged, and sometimes,<br>\
or often, his رُكْبَتَانِ [here improperly used as<br>\
meaning “ hocks ”] being near together, his legs<br>\
strike each other: (S, O:) and a man is also said<br>\
to be أَصَكُّ الرِّجْلَيْنِ: (TA:) the fem. is صَكَّآءُ:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) and the pl. is صُكٌّ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
One whose teeth, both the أَسْنَان and the أَضْرَاس,<br>\

مِصَكٌّ Strong: (S, O, K;) applied to a man;<br>\
and to other than man; (K;) [i. e.] applied to a<br>\
camel, and to an ass, (S, O,) as in a verse cited in<br>\
the last paragraph of art. سهر; (O;) and ↓ أَصَكُّ<br>\
signifies the same: (K:) the fem. of the former is<br>\
with ة; (S, O, TA;) which is held by Sb to be<br>\
rare; for epithets of the measures مِفْعَلٌ and مِفْعَالٌ<br>\
seldom have ة affixed to denote the fem. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  One says also رَأْسٌ مِصَكٌّ لِلرُّؤُوسِ [app. meaning<br>\
A head strong to butt, or knock, against other<br>\
heads]. (K in art. رأس.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also أَصَكُّ.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also A lock; syn. مِغْلَاقٌ. (K.)<br>\
مُصَكَّكٌ: see what follows.<br>\
مَصْكُوكٌ and ↓ مُصَكَّكٌ are epithets applied to a<br>\
camel, [app. as meaning Fleshy;] as though<br>\
flesh were thrust (صُكَّ, i. e. شُكَّ,) into him. (O.)<br>\
