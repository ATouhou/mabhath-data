تَصْحِيفٌ signifies (primarily, Msb) The<br>\
making a mistake (S, O, Msb, K, TA) in a<br>\
صَحِيفَة, (S, O, K, TA,) by reason of the ambiguity, or dubiousness, of the letters: a postclassical term: (TA:) or the reading a thing in a<br>\
manner at variance with what the writer intended, or at variance with the conventional<br>\
usage thereof: (Mgh:) a secondary signification<br>\
is the altering a word, or an expression, in such<br>\
a manner that the meaning intended by the application [thereof] becomes altered: (Msb:) or<br>\
it consists in the altering of a diacritical point<br>\
[or points]; as in النفى for النقى, or vice versâ:<br>\
(KT, after التَّحْرِيفُ:) one says, صحّف اللَّفْظَ He<br>\
altered the word, or expression, [in such a manner<br>\
that the meaning intended by the application<br>\
thereof became altered, or] so that it became<br>\
dubious [to the reader]. (Msb.) [See also تَحْرِيف,<br>\
in the first paragraph of art. حرف.]<br>\
4<br>\
أُصْحِفَ It had صُحُف [i. e. written pieces of<br>\
paper or of skin] (S, O, K, TA) collected in it,<br>\
(S, O,) or put in it (K, TA) between two boards.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تصحّف, said of a word, or an expression, It<br>\
became altered [so as to have a meaning different<br>\
from that intended by the application thereof,<br>\
(see 2,) or] so as to be dubious. (Msb.) One<br>\
says, تصحّف عَلَيْهِ لَفْظُ كَذَا [Such a word, or<br>\
such an expression, became altered so as to be<br>\
dubious to him]. (O, K. *)<br>\
صَحْفَةٌ [A sort of bowl;] a vessel like the قَصْعَةٌ,<br>\
(S, ISd, O, Msb, K, * TA,) expanded, wide, (ISd,<br>\
TA,) or a large, expanded قَصْعَة, (Mgh,) or,<br>\
accord. to Z, an oblong قَصْعَة, (Msb,) that<br>\
satisfies the hunger of five [men] (Ks, S, ISd,<br>\
Mgh, O, TA) and the like of them: (ISd, TA:)<br>\
Ks says, (S, O,) the largest sort of قَصْعَة is the<br>\
جَفْنَة; next to which is the قَصْعَة [properly so<br>\
called], (S, O, K,) which satisfies the hunger of<br>\
ten [men]; (S, O;) then, the صَحْفَة, (S, O, K,)<br>\
which satisfies the hunger of five; (S, O;) then,<br>\
the مِئْكَلَة, (S, O, K,) which satisfies two men,<br>\
and three; (S, O;) and then, the ↓ صُحَيْفَة, (S,<br>\
O, K,) which satisfies one man: (S, O:) the pl.<br>\
of صَحْفَةٌ is صِحَافٌ. (S, O, Mgh, Msb.) It is<br>\
said in a prov., اِسْتَفْرَغَ فُلَانٌ مَا فِى صَحْفَتِهِ Such<br>\
a one chose for himself, as his share, [or exhausted, all of] what was in his صحفة. (TA.)<br>\
صَحَفِىٌّ One who makes mistakes in reading the<br>\
صَحِيفَة [or writing, or written piece of paper or<br>\
of skin]; incorrectly termed by the vulgar صُحُفِىٌّ,<br>\
with two dammehs; (O, K;) [for the formation<br>\
of a rel. n. from a pl. of this kind (i. e. from<br>\
صُحُفٌ) is not allowable,] though the pl. is not<br>\
restored to the sing. in forming the rel. n. in the<br>\
case of proper names, such as أَنْمَارِىٌّ &amp;c., nor in<br>\
the case of words that are used in a manner like<br>\
that of proper names, such as أَنْصَارِىٌ &amp;c.: (O:)<br>\
or a learner, or one who acquires knowledge,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) from the صَحِيفَة, (Mgh,) inferior<br>\
[in rank] to the مَشَايِخِ [pl. of شَيْخٌ]: (Msb:) a<br>\
rel. n. from صَحِيفَةٌ; (Mgh, Msb;) like حَنَفِىٌّ and<br>\
بَجَلِىٌّ from حَنِيفَةُ and بَجِيلَةُ: (Msb:) and<br>\
↓ مُصَحِّفٌ signifies the same as صَحَفِىٌّ [in the<br>\
former of these senses]. (TA.)<br>\
صِحَافٌ Small places that are made for water<br>\
to collect and remain therein (مَنَاقِعُ صِغَارٌ تُتَّخَذُ<br>\
لِلْمَآءِ): pl. صُحُفٌ. (Esh-Sheybánee, O, K.)<br>\
صَحِيفٌ [appears from what here follows, to be<br>\
syn. with ↓ صَحِيفَةٌ, or rather it is a coll. gen. n.<br>\
of which the latter is the n. un.:] (tropical:)  The surface of<br>\
the ground or earth; (O, K, TA;) as being<br>\
likened to the thing [i. e. paper or skin] that is<br>\
written upon. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next paragraph.<br>\
صَحِيفَةٌ A written piece of paper (MA, Mgh,<br>\
Msb) or of skin; (Msb;) a writing, or thing<br>\
written; a book, or volume; a letter, i. e. an<br>\
epistle; syn. كِتَابٌ; (S, O, K;) [syn. with كِتَابٌ<br>\
in all of these senses; in the last of them in an<br>\
anecdote related in Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i.<br>\
721-2, and in Har p. 119, q. v.;] and a [portion<br>\
of a book, such as is termed] كُرَّاسَة; and a<br>\
register; [for] in the إِنْقَاع [a title of several<br>\
books, it is said that] the كُرَّاسَة and ↓ مُصْحَف<br>\
and صَحِيفَة and كِتَاب and دَفْتَر are one: (MA:)<br>\
pl. صُحُفٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and صُحْفٌ, a<br>\
contraction of the former, (TA,) and صَحَائِفُ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K,) like سَفَائِنُ pl. of سَفِينَةٌ; (Lth, O;)<br>\
the first of these pls. anomalous, (Lth, Sb, O,<br>\
K,) the sing. being likened to قَضِيتٌ (Sb, O, TA)<br>\
and قَلِيبٌ (Sb, TA) and رَغِيفٌ, (O,) of which the<br>\
pls. are قُضُبٌ (Sb, O, TA) and قُلُبٌ (Sb, TA)<br>\
and رُغُفٌ: (O:) [or صَحِيفٌ may be its original,<br>\
as well as regular, sing.:] see the next preceding<br>\
paragraph. صُحُفِ إِبْرٰهِيمَ وَمُوسَى, in the Kur<br>\
[lxxxvii. last verse], means [In the books of<br>\
Abraham and Moses; i. e.] the books revealed to<br>\
Abraham and Moses. (O.) [صَحِيفَةٌ also means<br>\
The record of the actions of anyone, that is kept<br>\
in heaven: (see رَقٌّ:) one says, صَحِيفَنُهُ سَوْدَآءُ,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  The record of his actions is black; a<br>\
phrase often used in the present day, in speaking<br>\
of a bad man.] Mohammad [the Hanafee Imám]<br>\
speaks of صُحُف not written upon; saying, فَإِنْ<br>\
كَانَتِ السَّرِقَةُ صُحُفًا لَيْسَ فِيهَا كِتَابٌ [And if the<br>\
stolen property be papers, or books, not having<br>\
any writing upon them]. (Mgh. [See, again,<br>\
رَقٌّ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  صَحِيفَةٌ signifies also A plank, board, or<br>\
leaf, of a door; like صَحَائِفُ [from which it is<br>\
perhaps formed by transposition, or it may be<br>\
tropical in this sense]: pl. صَحِيفٌ. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also (tropical:)  The external skin, or scarf-skin, of the<br>\
face: (O, TA:) or as some say, the part thereof<br>\
that fronts one: pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]<br>\
↓ صَحِيفٌ; or this may be used, in a verse in<br>\
which it occurs, for صَحِيفَة. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  One says<br>\
also صَحَائِفُ مِنْ شَحْمٍ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  Layers of fat].<br>\
(A in art. نير.)<br>\
صُحَيْفَةٌ: see صَحْفَةٌ.<br>\
صَحَّافٌ [A bookseller;] a seller of صُحُف: or<br>\
[a bookbinder;] a maker [meaning binder] of<br>\
صُحُف. (TA.)<br>\
مَصْحَفٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
مُصْحَفٌ (Th, S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and ↓ مِصْحَفٌ<br>\
(Th, S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ مَصْحَفٌ; (Th, O, K;)<br>\
the first of which is the original, (Fr, S, O, Msb,)<br>\
being from أُصْحِفَ meaning as expl. above, and<br>\
one of certain words that are pronounced by<br>\
[some of] the Arabs with kesr to the م instead of<br>\
damm because the latter is deemed by them<br>\
difficult of utterance, of which words are also<br>\
مِخْدَعٌ and مِطْرَفٌ and مِغْزَلٌ and مِجْسَدٌ, (Fr, S,<br>\
O,) or, accord. to AZ, Temeem pronounce the م<br>\
with kesr, and Keys pronounce it with damm,<br>\
[as do most persons in the instance of مصحف in<br>\
the present day,] and Th says that مَصْحَفٌ, with<br>\
fet-h, is correct and chaste; (O;) [A book, or<br>\
volume, consisting of] a collection of صُحُف, (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, K, TA,) written upon, and put between<br>\
two boards: (TA:) [generally applied in the<br>\
present day to a copy of the Kur-án:] and also<br>\
signifying a [portion of a book, such as is termed]<br>\
كُرَّاسَة: but the former is the primary [and more<br>\
common] signification: (Mgh:) pl. مَصَاحِفُ.<br>\
(KL.) See also صَحِيفَةٌ.<br>\
