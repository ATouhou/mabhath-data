بِالمَكَانِ ↓ اِصَّيَّفَ is like ↓ صَيَّفَ [probably a mistranscription for تَصَيَّفَ, of which اِصَّيَّفَ is a var.,<br>\
and of which, together with one of this var., an<br>\
ex. will be found in what follows]: (TA:) you<br>\
say, صِفْتُ بِمَكَانِ كَذَا [I remained during the<br>\
صَيْف in such a place], and in like manner<br>\
صِفْتُهُ, and ↓ تَصَيَّفْتُهُ, and ↓ صَيَّفْتُهُ [probably a mistranscription for ↓ اِصَّيَّفْتُهُ, as seems to be indicated<br>\
by what here follows]: (M:) a Hudhalee says,<br>\
تَصَيَّفْتُ نُعْمَانَ وَاصَّيَّفَتْ<br>\
[I remained during the صَيْف in Noamán, and<br>\
she remained during the صَيْف]. (M, TA.) ―<br>\

عَامَلَهُ مُصَايَفَةً (S, M, O, Msb, K) and صِيَافًا<br>\
(Lh, M) is from الصَّيْفُ, (M, O, Msb,) like<br>\

صَيْفٌ as signifying A certain portion of the<br>\
year is said by ISk to be fem.: (TA, voce شِتَآءٌ;<br>\
q. v.:) [but by others I find it treated as masc.:]<br>\
the صَيْف as meaning one of the seasons is well<br>\
known: (M:) Lth says, it is one of the quarters<br>\
of the year; and is applied by the vulgar to a<br>\
half of the year [i. e. to the half-year commencing<br>\
at the vernal equinox; the other half-year being<br>\
called by them the شِتَآء]: Az says, it is, with the<br>\
Arabs, the division which the vulgar in El-&#39;Irák<br>\
and Khurásán call the رَبِيع [i. e. the spring]; it<br>\
consists of three months; and the division that<br>\
next follows it is with the Arabs the قَيْظ; and in<br>\
it is the جَمْرَة [q. v.] of the قِيْظ; then, after this,<br>\
is the division called the خَرِيف; and then, after<br>\
this, the division called the شِتَآء: (TA:) [i. e.] it<br>\
is the quarter of the year vulgarly called the رَبِيع,<br>\
commencing when the sun enters Aries: but is<br>\
applied by the vulgar to the قَيْظ, which is the<br>\
[summer, i. e.] the quarter commencing when the<br>\
sun enters Cancer: (Msb in art. زمن; q. v.:) [F<br>\
says,] the صَيْف is the قَيْظ [i. e. summer, or the<br>\
hot season]; or [the season] after the رَبِيع: (K:)<br>\
and [Sgh says,] the صَيْف is one of the divisions<br>\
of the year; which is after the رَبِيع: (O:) [but<br>\
unless this explanation in the O denote only a<br>\
vulgar meaning, and the latter of the two explanations in the K be virtually a repetition, we<br>\
must suppose that, in each of them, by the ربيع is<br>\
meant the season of rain thus termed, which ends<br>\
in March: (see the latter of the two tables which<br>\
I have inserted voce زَمَنٌ:) most probably, I<br>\
think, both have been faultily transcribed from<br>\
what here follows; for the S is largely copied in<br>\
the O, and the S and O are among the principal sources of the K, which generally follows<br>\
the O when it differs (rightly or wrongly) from<br>\
the S:] the صَيْف is one of the divisions of the<br>\
year; which is after [that called] الرَّبِيعُ الأَوَّلُ and<br>\
before [that called] القَيْظُ: (S:) [this admits of two<br>\
renderings, both of which are correct; namely,<br>\
the quarter after the season of two months called<br>\
الربيع الاوّل (which ends in March) and before<br>\
the quarter called القيظ (which is summer); and<br>\
also the season of two months after that called<br>\
الربيع الاوّل and before the similar season called<br>\
القيظ: (see the former of the two tables to which<br>\
I have referred above:) but probably the latter<br>\
only was meant by him who first gave. this<br>\
explanation:] the pl. is أَصْيَافٌ (M, O, K) and<br>\
صُيُوفٌ: (M, Msb:) ↓ صَيْفَةٌ is a more particular<br>\
term [app. meaning A single صَيْف; (see 2;)];<br>\
it is like شَتْوَةٌ [q. v.]; (O, K;) and its pl. is صِيَفٌ,<br>\
like بِدَرٌ pl. of بَدْرَةٌ. (Fr, O, K.) الصَّيْفَ ضَيَّعْتِ<br>\
اللَّبَنَ is a saying expl. in art. ضيع [q. v.]. (O,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الصَّيْفُ also signifies The rain that comes<br>\
in the [season called] صَيْف; (S, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
[see, again, the second of the tables to which I<br>\
have referred above, and see also نَوْ ٌ;] and (O,<br>\
K) so ↓ الصَّيِّفُ; (M, O, K;) also signifying the<br>\
herbage thereof: (M:) or, (K,) accord. to Lth,<br>\
(O,) the latter signifies the rain that falls after<br>\
the division [a mistake for the rain] called the<br>\
رَبِيع; (O, K;) and so the former; (K;) and it is<br>\
also called ↓ الصَّيْفِىُّ; (O, K;) which likewise<br>\
signifies the herbage thereof. (TA.) Hence the<br>\
prov., relating to the completing of the performance of a needful affair, تَمَامُ الرَّبِيعِ الصَّيْفُ [The<br>\
completion of the rain called the ربيع is that called<br>\
the صيف]: for the rain called the ربيع is the first<br>\
rain, and the صيف is that which is [next] after it.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  آيَةُ الصَّيْفِ is [A verse] in the end (آخِر)<br>\
of سُورَةُ النِّسَآءِ [the 4th chapter of the Kur-án,<br>\
but which verse I know not], mentioned in a<br>\
tradition. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The female of the بُوم<br>\
[or owl]. (Kr, M.)<br>\

half.<br>\

-b2-  A young camel born in<br>\
the صَيْف. (M.) [And in like manner a sheep<br>\
or goat: see صَفَرِىٌّ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A son<br>\
born to a father [in the summer of his age, i. e.]<br>\
old, or advanced in age. (S, M, O.) [See an ex.<br>\
in a verse cited voce رِبْعِىٌّ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  See also صَيْفٌ,<br>\
near the end of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b5-  صَيْفِيَّةٌ [used as<br>\
a subst., or as an epithet in which the quality of<br>\
a subst. is predominant, for مِيرَةٌ صَيْفِيَّةٌ,] and<br>\
↓ صَائِفَةٌ signify The مِيرَة [or provision of corn &amp;c.]<br>\
in the first part of the صَيْف [here meaning<br>\
spring]; i. e. the second ميرة; for the first of the<br>\
مِيرَ is the رِبْعِيَّة, then the صَيْفِيَّة, then the دَفَئِيَّة,<br>\
and then the رَمَضِيَّة: (M:) or the ↓ صَائِفَة of a<br>\
people is their مِيرَة in the صَيْف. (S, O, K.) [See<br>\
مِيرَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b6-  [صَيْفِيَّةٌ is also applied to The latter, or<br>\
last, season of the bringing forth of camels; so in<br>\
an explanation of هُبَعٌ in the S and TA.]<br>\
صَيْفِيَّةٌ [fem. of صَيْفِىٌّ: and also used as a subst.,<br>\
or as an epithet in which the quality of a subst. is<br>\
predominant: see the latter word].<br>\
صَائِفٌ is used as an imitative sequent in the<br>\
phrase صَيْفٌ صَائِفٌ, (S, O, K,) meaning A warm,<br>\
or hot, [spring or] summer: (PS:) a phrase like<br>\
لَيْلٌ لَائِلٌ &amp;c. (S, O.) And one says يَوْمٌ صَائِفٌ,<br>\
(S, M, O, Msb, K,) meaning A hot day; (O,<br>\
K;) and ↓ يَوْمٌ صَافٌ (S, O, K) was sometimes<br>\
said, meaning صَائِفٌ; like يَوْمٌ رَاحٌ [as meaning<br>\
رَائِحٌ]: (S:) and لَيْلَةٌ صَائِفَةٌ [a hot night]. (S, O,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And مَطَرٌ صَائِفٌ [app. Rain coming in<br>\
the صَيْف, meaning spring; as also ↓ مُصِيفٌ,<br>\
occurring in a verse cited voce رَسَمَ, q. v.]. (M.)<br>\

(Mgh, and Ham ib.) And [particularly] (Mgh)<br>\
A warring, or warring and plundering, expedition against the Greeks (الرُّوم): because they<br>\
[i. e. the Arabs] used to go on expeditions of this<br>\
kind in the صيف, (S, Mgh, O, K,) and to return<br>\
in the winter, (Mgh,) on account of the cold and<br>\
snow. (S, O, K.) And they said, وَلِىَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
الصَّائِفَةَ, meaning Such a one was commander of<br>\
the army going on a warring, or warring and<br>\
plundering, expedition in the صَيْف: (Ham ubi<br>\
suprà:) [but Mtr says,] he who explains صَائِفَةٌ as<br>\
meaning the place [of], or the army [engaged in,<br>\
such an expedition], errs: [adding that the<br>\
Hanafee Imám] Mohammad has used the phrase<br>\
الصَّوَائِفُ وَنَحْوُهَا مِنَ العَسَاكِرِ العِظَامِ either by<br>\
surmise or by extension of the [proper] meaning.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
