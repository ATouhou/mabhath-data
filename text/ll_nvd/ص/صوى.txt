صَوَتِ النَّخْلَةُ, (Lth, Az, S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
تَصْوِى, (S, K,) inf. n. صُوِىٌّ; (Lth, Az, S, M, K;)<br>\
and صَوِيَت, (Az, M, K,) which is the form<br>\
preferred by Az, [aor. تَصْوَى,] inf. n. صَوًى;<br>\
(TA;) The palm-tree needed irrigation, and<br>\
became slender: (Az, TA:) or became dry, or<br>\
dried up; (S, M, K;) as also ↓ أَصْوَت, and<br>\
↓ صَوَّت: (K:) and in like manner one says of<br>\
other trees: and sometimes, of animals. (M.)<br>\
And صَوِىَ الضَّرْعُ The udder had no milk remaining in it. (Ham p. 661.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] صَوَتِ<br>\
الشَّاةُ The ewe, or she-goat, became fat, (S, TA,)<br>\
in consequence of her udder&#39;s having been made to<br>\
dry up. (S.) And صَوِىَ He became strong. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
صوّى, (M,) inf. n. تَصْوِيَةٌ, (K,) primarily,<br>\
(M,) is used in relation to females, meaning He<br>\
abstained from milking her, in order that she<br>\
might become fat, (M, K,) and not be weak.<br>\
(M.) You say, صَوَّيْتُ النَّاقَةَ I abstained from<br>\
milking the she-camel for some days in order that<br>\
the milk might collect in her udder so that she might<br>\
become fat: or I made her milk to dry up, that<br>\
she might become fatter. (M.) And صَوَّيْتُ الشَّاةَ,<br>\
inf. n. as above, I made the udder of the ewe, or<br>\
goat, to become dry, that she might become<br>\
fatter: (S:) or صوّيت الغَنَمَ I made the milk of<br>\
the ewes, or goats, to dry up, purposely, that they<br>\
might become fatter; like as one says in relation<br>\
to camels: the subst. from the verb thus used is<br>\
↓ صَوًى; and this is said to mean The leaving an<br>\
animal and not milking her. (M.) Some say<br>\
that تَصْوِيَةٌ is like تَصْرِيَةٌ; and hence the trad.,<br>\
التَّصْوِيَةُ خِلَابَةٌ [i. e. The causing the milk to<br>\
collect in the udder of an animal by abstaining<br>\
from milking her for some days, when one desires<br>\
to sell her, is an endeavouring to deceive: but I<br>\
think that the right reading in this instance is<br>\
probably التَّصْرِيَةُ, with ر]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also<br>\
used in relation to a stallion (S, M, K) of the<br>\
camels: (S:) thus it is used by El-Fak&#39;asee.<br>\
(M.) One says, صَوَّيْتُ الفَحْلَ, (M,) inf. n. as<br>\
above, (S, K,) I put no burden upon the stallion<br>\
[camel], and did not bind him with a rope, in<br>\
order that he might become more brisk in covering, and more strong; (S, * M, K; *) thus expl.<br>\
by El-&#39;Adebbes El-Kinánee: (S:) or I exempted<br>\
him from work, and fed him, until his spirit<br>\
returned to him, and he became fat. (M.) And<br>\
صَوَّيْتُ لِإِبِلِى فَحْلًا I chose for my camels a<br>\
stallion, and fed and nourished him for the office<br>\
of the stallion. (S.)<br>\

أَصْوَىَ see 1. ―<br>\

صَوًى a subst. from 2, q. v. (M.)<br>\

-b2-  [Also,<br>\
app., Empty سُنْبُل (or ears of corn): accord. to<br>\
the TA (on the authority of Az): the word in this<br>\
sense, and thus applied, is there written with the<br>\
article, الصوى, without any syll. sign.]<br>\
صَوِيَّةٌ: see the following paragraph.<br>\
صَاوٍ Dry, (S, K, TA,) by reason of thirst, or<br>\
want of irrigation, or by reason of leanness, or<br>\
emaciation. (TA.) You say نَخْلَةٌ صَاوِيَةٌ, (M,<br>\
K,) and ↓ صَوِيَةٌ, (M, TA,) [agreeably with rule,<br>\
as part. n. of صَوِيَت,] or ↓ صَوِيَّةٌ, (so in copies of<br>\
the K, [app. a mistranscription,]) A dry, or driedup, palm-tree: (M, K:) and in like manner one<br>\
terms other trees: and sometimes, animals: thus<br>\
the poet Sá&#39;ideh applies the epithet صاوية to<br>\
wild cows or wild oxen (بَقَر وَحْش). (M.) ―<br>\
