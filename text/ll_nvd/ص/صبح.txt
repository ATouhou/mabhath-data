inf. n. تَصْبِيحٌ; (TA;) He gave him to drink a<br>\

Mgh, K, TA;) [and] so صَبَحَهُ صَبُوحًا: (MA:)<br>\

-b2-  And both are said<br>\
respecting a غَارَة [meaning (assumed tropical:)  He made a hostile,<br>\

as though he made the غارة to be to him a<br>\
morning-draught: see صَابِحٌ]. (Ham p. 66.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[And accord. to Reiske, as stated by Freytag,<br>\
صَبَحَ signifies He drank in the early morning:<br>\
but I think that Reiske may have assigned to it<br>\
this meaning from his having found the pass.<br>\
form of the verb, not distinguished as such, used<br>\
in a case in which it might be supposed to signify<br>\
thus.]. ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 2, in five places.<br>\

an inf. n. [of which the verb is صَبِحَ accord. to a<br>\
general rule] signifies The being satiated, or<br>\

The horsemen came to them at daybreak, at the<br>\
time termed the صُبْح: (TA:) but Aboo-&#39;Adnán<br>\
says that there is a difference between صَبَّحْنَا and<br>\
↓ صَبَحْنَا; which is this: you say, صَبَّحْنَا بَلَدَ كَذَا<br>\
[We came in the morning to such a town, or<br>\
country], and صَبَّحْنَا فُلَانًا [We came in the<br>\

evil, without teshdeed; as though we made the<br>\
good or the evil to be a morning-draught, or<br>\
putting the second of the nouns following the<br>\
verb in the accus. case because of بِ suppressed]:<br>\
you say also, صبّحهُ بِكَذَا; and you may also say,<br>\
بكذا ↓ صَبَحَهُ, as well as صَبَحَهُ كَذَا; He came to<br>\

happy; or grant thee a good, or happy, morning]: a prayer for the person thus addressed,<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And صَبَّحْتُهُ I said to him عِمْ صَبَاحًا<br>\
[expl. below, see صَبَاحٌ]; (S;) and صَبَّحَهُمْ he said<br>\
to them عِمُوا صَبَاحًا: (K:) or صَبَّحْتُهُ means I said<br>\
to him صَبَّحَكَ اللّٰهُ بِخَيْرٍ [expl. above]. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  See also 1, first sentence. ―<br>\

فُلَانٌ الحَقَّ (tropical:)  Such a one declared, or told clearly,<br>\

4<br>\
اصبح He entered upon the time of morning<br>\
termed صَبَاح [which means both dawn and forenoon]: (S, * Msb: [in the former this meaning is<br>\
indicated, but not expressed:]) or he entered upon<br>\
the time of daybreak, or dawn, the time termed<br>\
صُبْح. (L, K.) By the following words of EshShemmákh,<br>\
وَقِيلُ المُنَادِى أَصْبَحَ القَوْمُ أَدْلِجِى<br>\
is meant, [And the saying of the crier is,] The<br>\
people, or party, have nearly entered upon the<br>\
time of dawn: prosecute the night-journey: for<br>\
the Arabs, when they have nearly arrived at a<br>\
place which they desire to reach, say, قَدْ بَلَغْنَاهُ;<br>\
and when travellers are near the time of daybreak, they say, أَصْبَحْنَا. (T, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
(tropical:)  He awoke from sleep in the جَوْف [i. e. last<br>\
third, or last sixth,] of the night. (A, TA.)<br>\
[And simply (tropical:)  He awoke: for] one says to the<br>\
sleeper, أَصْبِحْ, meaning (tropical:)  Awake thou from sleep.<br>\
(A, TA.) And one says also, أَصْبِحْ يَا رَجُلُ,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  Become roused, O man, (A, K, * TA,)<br>\
from thy heedlessness or inadvertence, (A, TA,)<br>\
and see thy right course, (K, TA,) and what will<br>\
rectify thy state. (TA.) And أَصْبِحْ لَيْلُ (tropical:)  [Become morning, O night] a prov.: (Meyd, A,<br>\
TA:) said in a distressing night, that is long by<br>\
reason of evil. (Meyd. [See Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov., i. 727.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Also He, or it, became in<br>\
the morning in any particular state or condition:<br>\
in this sense, and in that next following, an incomplete, i. e. a non-attributive, verb.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
[hence, simply,] He, or it, became; syn. صَارَ.<br>\
(S, K.) One says, اصبح عَالِمًا He became knowing, or learned. (S, TA.) Thus, فَأَصْبَحُوا ظَاهِرِينَ,<br>\
in the Kur lxi. last verse, means And they became<br>\
victorious. (Bd.) And فَأَصْبَحَ يُقَلِّبُ كَفَّيْهِ, in<br>\
the Kur xviii. 40, [And he became in a state, or<br>\
condition, in which he turned over his hands;<br>\
i. e.] and he became repentant, or grieved for<br>\
what he had done. (A in art. قلب, and Bd.)<br>\
And فَأَصْبَحُوا لَا تَرَى إِلَّا مَسَاكِنَهُمْ, in the Kur<br>\
xlvi. 24, i. e. [And they became] in a condition<br>\
such that, if thou wert present in their country,<br>\
thou wouldst not see aught save their dwellingplaces; or, as Hamzeh and Ks read, لَا يُرَى إِلَّا<br>\
مَسَاكِنُهُمْ [there was not to be seen aught save their<br>\
dwelling-places]. (Bd.) [أَصْبَحَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا is of<br>\
frequent occurrence, meaning He became occupied, or engaged, in doing such a thing; he betook,<br>\
set, or applied, himself to doing such a thing; set<br>\
about, or commenced, doing such a thing; or<br>\
began to do such a thing.] ―<br>\
-b5-  [Also He performed the prayer of daybreak.] It is said in a<br>\
trad., أَصْبِحُوا بِالصُّبْحِ, meaning Perform ye the<br>\
prayer of daybreak in the time of daybreak. (L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  See also 8. ―<br>\
-b7-  Also He acted gently. (TA in<br>\
art. ارش: see an ex. in a verse cited voce مَأْروُشٌ.)<br>\
-A2-  إِصْبَاحٌ He trimmed a lamp, or wick;<br>\
or prepared it properly for use. (TA.) ―<br>\

-A3-  as a subst., see صُبْحٌ, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
5<br>\
تصبّح He slept in the morning; or first<br>\
part of day, before sunrise. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And He ate such food as is termed a صُبْحَة.<br>\
(K, TA.) It is said in a trad., مَنْ تَصَبَّحَ بِسَبْعِ<br>\
تَمَرَاتِ عَجْوَةٍ [He who eats as a صُبْحَة seven dates<br>\
of the sort called عَجْوَة]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 8, in<br>\
two places.<br>\

فُلَانٌ يَتَصَابَحُ and<br>\
يَتَحَاسَنُ [Such a one<br>\
affects to be beautful, comely, pretty, or elegant:<br>\
the latter verb is here added as an explicative of<br>\
the former: see صَبُحَ]. (A, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اصطبح He drank a morning-draught, or<br>\
what is termed a صَبُوح; (S, K, TA;) [and] so<br>\
↓ اصبح. (Msb. [Thus in my copy of the Msb,<br>\
but probably a mistranscription, for the former is<br>\
the verb well known in this sense, and is not in<br>\
that copy.]) It is said in a trad., مَالَنَا صَبِىٌّ يَصْطَبِحُ<br>\
[We have not a child that drinks a morningdraught]; meaning we have not as much milk as<br>\
a child may drink in the early morning, in consequence of the drought. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And i. q. أَسْرَجَ<br>\
[as meaning He lighted a lamp or wick, or himself or another with a lamp &amp;c.]; (K, TA;) and<br>\
so ↓ اصبح (A, TA) [in the former sense], as in<br>\
the phrase اصبح مِصْبَاحًا [he lighted a lamp or<br>\
wick]; (A;) and اصبح alone has this meaning,<br>\
i. e. أَسْرَجَ سِرَاجًا. (TA, from a trad.) [But it is<br>\
used often in the latter sense:] one says, الشَّمْعُ<br>\
مِمَّا يُصْطَبَحُ بِهِ Candles are of the things with<br>\
which one lights [himself, or others]; syn. يُسْرَجُ:<br>\
(S:) [and in like manner ↓ تصبّح; for] one says,<br>\
هُوَ يَتَصَبَّحُ بِالشُّمُوعِ [He lights himself, or others,<br>\
with candles]: (A:) [and in like manner also<br>\
↓ استصبح; for] one says, استصبح بِالمِصْبَاحِ (S,<br>\
MA, Mgh, Msb, K *) He lighted [himself, or<br>\
another,] with the lamp, or wick; (MA;) syn.<br>\
أَسْرَجَ; (S;) or اِسْتَسْرَجَ: (K:) [hence it appears<br>\
that اصطبح بِهِ and به ↓ استصبح and به ↓ تصبّح<br>\
may be aptly rendered he employed it as a means<br>\
of light; and thus the second of these three verbs,<br>\
is expl. in treatises on practical law:] one says<br>\
also, بِالدُّهْنِ ↓ استصبح [He employed oil as a<br>\
means of light; or] he made the lamp, or wick, to<br>\
give light by means of oil: (Mgh, Msb:) and it<br>\
is said in a trad. respecting the several sorts of<br>\
fat (شُحُوم) of carrion, بِهَا النَّاسُ ↓ يَسْتَصْبِحُ The<br>\
people [employ them as means of light; or] make<br>\
their lamps, or wicks, to give light by means of<br>\
them. (TA.)<br>\

↓ مُصْبَحٌ (K [or perhaps the last should be مَصْبَحٌ,<br>\
q. v.]) Daybreak, or dawn; syn. فَجْرٌ; (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K;) i. e. (so in the Msb, but in the K<br>\
“ or ”) the beginning, or first part, of day: (Msb,<br>\
K:) ↓ إِصْبَاحٌ is an inf. n. [inf. n. of أَصْبَحَ] used<br>\
in the sense of صُبْح, in the Kur vi. 96, (Jel,) and<br>\
is similar to إِبْكَارٌ; (TA;) [and ↓ مُصْبَحٌ is the n. of<br>\
place and time from أَصْبَحَ:] the pl. of صُبْحٌ is<br>\
أَصْبَاحٌ; (K;) and thus some read in the Kur vi. 96.<br>\
(Bd.) See also أَصْبَحُ. One says, أَتَيْتُهُ لِصُبْحِ<br>\
خَامِسَةٍ and خامسة ↓ لِصِبْحِ, (S, K,) meaning [I<br>\
came to him] in the morning (صَبَاح) [of the last]<br>\
of five days; (K;) i. e., of a fifth day; (TK;)<br>\
[or rather, of a fifth night, as the last word is<br>\
fem.;] like as one says, لِمُِسْىِ خامسة. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
الصُّبْحُ is also used as meaning (assumed tropical:)  The truth; and<br>\
the clear, or plain, thing or case. (Ham p. 449.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And أُمُّ صُبْحٍ is one of the names of Mekkeh.<br>\
(K, * TA.)<br>\
صِبْحٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
صَبَحٌ: see صُبْحَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The glistening of<br>\
iron (K, TA) and of other things. (TA.)<br>\
صَبْحَةٌ: see the next paragraph, in three places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also A watering of camels in the morning, or<br>\
first part of day, before sunrise: which is not<br>\
esteemed by the Arabs wholesome: the time approved by them for watering is when the sun is<br>\
near the meridian. (TA.)<br>\
صُبْحَةٌ The early part of the forenoon, after<br>\
sunrise; syn. ضُحًى; as also ↓ صَبْحَةٌ: (Msb:) or<br>\
the period of one&#39;s entering upon the صَبَاح [which<br>\
means both dawn and forenoon]: so in the saying,<br>\
لَقِيتُهُ ذَاتَ صُبْحَةٍ [I met him when he was entering<br>\
upon the dawn or forenoon]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A<br>\
sleep in the morning, or first part of day, before<br>\
sunrise; as also ↓ صَبْحَةٌ; (S, * K;) or both signify<br>\
a sleep in the ضُحَى [expl. above]; (A;) but the<br>\
latter is by some disapproved: such sleep is forbidden in a trad., because it is in a time for the<br>\
commemoration of the praises of God and then<br>\
for seeking gain. (TA.) One says, فُلَانٌ يَنَامُ<br>\
الصُّبْحَةَ and ↓ الصَّبْحَةَ [Such a one sleeps in the<br>\
first part of day, before sunrise]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
Food with which one contents, or diverts, himself [so as to allay the craving of his stomach], in<br>\
the morning or first part of day, before sunrise.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also صَبُوحٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also (Suh, K, TA,)<br>\
and ↓ صَبَحٌ, (Lth, S, TA,) [each said in one place<br>\
in the K to be an inf. n. of which the verb is<br>\
صَبِحَ,] Blackness inclining to redness: (K:) or<br>\
intense redness in the hair: (Lth, TA:) or a colour<br>\
inclining to that which is termed صُهْبَة: (K, TA:)<br>\
or nearly the same as صُهْبَة: (Lth, * S, * TA:) or<br>\
a colour inclining to that termed شُهْبَة: (K,<br>\
TA:) or whiteness that is not clear, or pure; so<br>\
the former is expl. by Suh. (TA. [See also<br>\
أَصَبَحُ.])<br>\
صَبْحَانُ A man who has drunk a morningdraught, or what is termed a صَبُوح; (TA;) or<br>\

(Aboo-&#39;Adnán, TA:) [in the S and K it is implied that it is syn. with مُصْطَبِحٌ, q. v.:] fem.<br>\
صَبْحَى. (S, TA.) Hence the prov., أَكْذَبُ مِنَ<br>\
الأَخِيذِ الصَّبْحَانِ (Aboo-&#39;Adnán, S, TA) More<br>\
lying than the captive who had satisfied his thirst<br>\
with a morning-draught: (Aboo-&#39;Adnán, TA:)<br>\
the person thus alluded to was a man who was<br>\
among a people that gave him a morning-draught,<br>\
after which he arose and quitted them, and was<br>\
taken by another people, who said to him,<br>\
“ Guide us to the place where thou wast; ” to<br>\
which he replied, “I have passed the night in<br>\
the bare desert: ” but presently he sat down to<br>\
make water, so they knew that he had passed the<br>\
night with a people near by; and by his means<br>\
they found their way to them, and exterminated<br>\
them: (IAar, TA:) or the prov. is أَكْذَبُ مِنَ<br>\
الأَخِدِ الصَّبْحَانِ More lying than the young unweaned camel that has satisfied its thirst with<br>\
drinking [its mother&#39;s milk in the morning];<br>\
which [seems to be thirsty but] will not drink of<br>\
its mother&#39;s milk when one desires it to do so:<br>\
(IAar, Sh, TA:) or, accord. to Fr, than the young<br>\
unweaned camel that is affected with indigestion,<br>\
or heaviness of the stomach, from drinking much<br>\
milk, and therefore craves for milk again. (Meyd.<br>\
[See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov.: he seems to<br>\
have followed a faulty text.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also the fem.,<br>\

-b2-  Also (Msb) Contr. of<br>\
مَسَآءٌ, (S, A, Msb,) and so ↓ صَبِيحَةٌ, (S,) [and<br>\
↓ أُصْبُوحَةٌ (as in a phrase following in this paragraph), and ↓ مَصْبَحٌ, (see this last word,)] i. e.<br>\
Morning, or forenoon, counted from sunrise to<br>\
noon: (Msb and TA in art. مسو:) or, accord. to<br>\
some, from midnight to noon: (TA in art. مسو:)<br>\
or, accord. to the Arabs, from the beginning of<br>\
the latter half of the night to the time when the<br>\
sun declines from the meridian; then commences<br>\
the مَسَآء, extending to the end of the former half<br>\
of the night; thus expl. by Th; so says El-Jawá-<br>\
leekee. (Msb.) The Arabs say, when they<br>\
regard a man, &amp;c., as ominous of evil, صَبَاحُ<br>\
اللّٰهِ لَا صَبَاحُكَ [God&#39;s morning: not thy morning]:<br>\
and if you will, you may say, صَبَاحَ اللّٰهِ لَا صَبَاحَكَ.<br>\
(Lh, TA.) And عِمْ صَبَاحًا, (S,) or عِمُوا صَبَاحًا,<br>\
(K,) lit. imperative, but meaning a prayer, i. e.<br>\
May thy life, or your life, be pleasant during the<br>\
morning, (Har p. 32, and TA * in arts. نعم and<br>\
وعم,) is a salutation of the people of the Time of<br>\
Ignorance. (TA.) One says also, لَقِيتُهُ صَبَاحًا,<br>\
and ذَا صَبَاحٍ, (S,) or أَتَيْتُهُ ذَا صَبَاحٍ, (K,) which<br>\
[i. e. ذا صباح] is only used adverbially, (Sb, S,<br>\
K,) except in the dial. of Khath&#39;am, (Sb, S,)<br>\
meaning [I met him, or I came to him,] in a<br>\
morning, [or] between daybreak and sunrise:<br>\
(K:) the following verse (S, TA) by Anas Ibn-Nuheyk, of Khath&#39;am, (TA,) or, as some say,<br>\
by Iyás Ibn-Mudrikeh El-Hanafee, (so in a marg.<br>\
note in a copy of the S,) presents an exception to<br>\
the adverbial usage:<br>\
عَزَمْتُ عَلَى إِقَامَةِ ذِى صَبَاحٍ<br>\
لِأَمْرٍ مَّا يُسَوَّدُ مَنْ يَسُودُ<br>\
(S, TA:) the poet means, I determined to stay<br>\
until the time of the صباح [i. e. either dawn or<br>\
forenoon]: for it is on account of some particular<br>\
thing, i. e. some good quality, or some praiseworthy thing, that he is made a chief who becomes<br>\
a chief: thus Ibn-Es-Seeráfee explains this verse.<br>\
(TA.) And one says, ↓ أَتَيْتُهُ ذَا صَبُوحٍ, not used<br>\
otherwise than adverbially, meaning the same as<br>\
ذَا صَبَاحٍ, expl. above; (K;) and ↓ ذَاتَ الصَّبُوحِ in<br>\
the morning, or first part of day, before sunrise: (IAar, TA:) or ↓ ذَا صَبُوحٍ [properly means]<br>\
in a time of drinking the [morning-draught called]<br>\
صَبُوح. (TA.) And يَوْمِ كَذَا ↓ أَتَيْتُهُ صَبِيحَةَ [I<br>\
came to him in the dawn, or in the morning, or<br>\
forenoon, of such a day]: (A:) and ↓ أُصْبُوحَةَ<br>\
كُلِّ يَوْمٍ [in the morning of every day]; and in<br>\
like manner, أُمْسِيَّةَ كُلِّ يَوْمٍ. (S.) And أَتَيْتُهُ<br>\
صَبَاحَ مَسَآءَ, (Sb, A, TA,) for صَبَاحًا وَمَسَآءً, [I came<br>\
to him morning and evening,] meaning every<br>\
morning and evening: (Sharh esh-Shudhoor, p.<br>\
31:) the two nouns are thus constructed by some<br>\
of the Arabs, after the manner of خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ: but<br>\
some prefix the former noun to the other, putting<br>\
the latter in the gen. case, except when the expression is used as a denotative of state, or adverbially: (TA:) [or, accord. to IHsh,] صَبَاحَ<br>\
مَسَآءٍ is allowable as [an adverbial expression]<br>\
meaning صَبَاحَ ذَا مَسَآءٍ [lit. in a morning having<br>\
an evening, or in a forenoon having an afternoon];<br>\
and a similar instance occurs in the Kur, ch.<br>\
lxxix. last verse. (Sharh esh-Shudhoor, ubi<br>\
suprà.) ―<br>\
-b3-  يَوْمُ الصَّبَاحِ means (tropical:)  The day of the<br>\
hostile, or predatory, incursion. (S, A, K.) The<br>\
Arabs, when suddenly attacked in the morning<br>\
by a troop of horsemen, cry aloud, يَا صَبَاحَاهْ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [O! a hostile, or predatory, incursion!]; warning the whole tribe: (TA:) this is said by him<br>\
who calls for aid: (JM:) for they generally made<br>\
a hostile, or predatory, incursion in the morning:<br>\
