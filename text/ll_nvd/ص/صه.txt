صَهَّ القَوْمَ He chid the people or party [app.<br>\
saying to them صَهْ: see what next follows].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
صَهْصَهَ بِهِمْ He silenced them, saying<br>\
to them صَهْ صَهْ: (K, TA:) and they said also<br>\
صَهْصَيْتُ [for صَهْصَهْتُ], like as they said دَهْدَيْتُ<br>\
for دَهْدَهْتُ. (TA.)<br>\
صَهْ, as also صَهٍ, (S, IAth, K,) and صَهِ, and صَهًا,<br>\
(TA,) a word used in chiding the person [or<br>\
persons] to whom it is said, (K, TA,) thus in the<br>\
M, or rather (TA) it is a verbal noun, (S, IAth,<br>\
TA,) used in commanding silence, (S, TA,)<br>\
meaning Be silent, (S, IAth, K, TA,) addressed<br>\
to a single person, and to two persons, and to a<br>\
pl. number, and to a male, and to a female:<br>\
(IAth, TA:) and one says also صَهٍ صَهْ: Mbr<br>\
says, if you say, صَهٍ يَا رَجُلُ [Be silent, O man],<br>\
it is to distinguish between that which is determinate and that which is indeterminate; صَهٍ being<br>\
indeterminate: (S, TA:) [i. e.,] as IJ says, the<br>\
saying صَهٍ, with tenween, is as though you said<br>\
سُكُوتًا; and when you pronounce it without tenween, it is as though you said السُّكُوتَ: or, as<br>\
IAth says, when with tenween, it is as though<br>\
you said, اُسْكُتْ سُكُوتًا; and when without tenween,<br>\
as though you said, اُسْكُتِ السُّكُوتَ المَعْرُوفَ مِنْكَ.<br>\
