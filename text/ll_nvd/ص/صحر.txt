صَحَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
صَحَرَ, (S, K,) inf. n. صَحْرٌ, (S, TA,)<br>\
namely, milk, He made it to become what is<br>\
termed صَحِيرَة: (S, TA:) or he cooked it, (K,<br>\
TA,) and then gave it to a sick person to drink.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  صَحَرَتْهُ الشَّمْسُ The sun pained his<br>\
brain: (K:) it is like صَهَرَتْهُ; (A;) or, as some<br>\
say, melted him. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  صَحَرَ, aor.<br>\
صَحَرَ, inf. n.<br>\
صَحِيرٌ and صُحَارٌ, He (an ass) uttered a sound<br>\
[or braying] more vehement than the neighing of<br>\
horses. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  [Golius explains صَحَرَ as meaning It spread out wide, said of a place, on the<br>\
authority of J: but the verb is اصحر, q. v.; and<br>\
the authority is not J.]<br>\

صَاْحَرَ [صِحَارٌ is an inf. n. of صَاحَرَ, a verb not<br>\
mentioned: hence,] أَبْرَزَ لَهُ مَا فِى نَفْسِهِ مِنَ الأَمْرِ<br>\
صِحَارَا (assumed tropical:)  [He showed to him what was in his<br>\
mind, of the thing, or affair, openly]: a saying<br>\
like جَاهَرَهُ بِهِ جِهَارًا. (K, * TA. [See also 4.])<br>\
4<br>\
اصحر, (S, A, Mgh, K,) or اصحر الصَّحْرَآءَ,<br>\
(Msb, [but I think that this is a mistake for<br>\
اصحر إِلَى الصَّحْرَآءِ,]) inf. n. إِصْحَارٌ, (Msb,) He<br>\
went forth to the صحرآء [or desert, &amp;c.], (S, A,<br>\
Mgh,) or into the صحرآء: (Msb, K:) تصحّر [in<br>\
this sense] has not been heard. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, in a trad., the saying of Umm-Selemeh to<br>\
&#39;Áïsheh, سَكَّنَ اللّٰهُ عُقَيْرَاكِ فَلَا تُصْحِرِيهَا [app.<br>\
meaning, accord. to explanations of it in the TA<br>\
in art. عقر, God hath made thy dwelling and<br>\
estate, or, as Z explains it, thy person (نَفْسَكِ), to<br>\
be quietly settled, therefore do not thou remove it<br>\
forth to the desert]; i. e. لَا تُبْرِزِيهَا إِلَى الصَّحْرَآءِ;<br>\
the verb, accord. to IAth, being made trans. by<br>\
the suppression of the prep.; [i. e. تُصْحِرِيهَا being<br>\
for تُصْحِرِى بِهَا;] for it is [properly] intrans.<br>\
(TA. [See also the next sentence but one, in<br>\
which the verb is tropically made trans.]) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
أَصْحِرْ لِعَدُوِّكَ means (assumed tropical:)  Be thou in a state of clearness [or certainty] with respect to the case of thy<br>\
enemy: (JM, TA:) occurring in a trad. of &#39;Alee.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  One says also, أَصْحَرَ بِالأَمْرِ and أَصْحَرَهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  He revealed, or made manifest, the affair, or<br>\
case: and لَا تُصْحِرْ أَمْرَكَ (tropical:)  [Reveal not thy affair,<br>\
or case]: and أَصْحِرْهُ بِمَا فِى قَلْبِكَ (tropical:)  [Reveal to<br>\
him what is in thy mind]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  اصحر<br>\
said of a place, It was, or became, wide, or<br>\
spacious; (O, K, TA;) i. e. it became like the<br>\
صَحْرَآء. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Said of a man, He was, or<br>\
became, blind of one eye. (K.)<br>\
11<br>\
اصحارّ It (a plant) dried up; or became<br>\
yellow; or dried up and became yellow: (S:) or<br>\
became of a dingy red colour, and then dried up<br>\
and became yellow: (TA:) and (TA) it (a plant,<br>\
K, or an ear of corn, TA) became red: or its first<br>\
parts became white. (K, TA.)<br>\
صِحْرٌ an imitative sequent to صِفْرٌ [q. v.]. (Kh,<br>\
Ham p. 354.)<br>\
صَحَرٌ: see صُحْرَةٌ.<br>\
لَقِيتُةُ صَحْرَةَ بَحْرَةَ, in which the two nouns are<br>\
imperfectly decl., (S, L,) being regarded as one,<br>\
(L,) and صَحْرَةً بَحْرَةً, (K in art. بحر,) and<br>\
بُحْرَةَ ↓ صُحْرَةَ, with damm, (O,) and صُحْرَةً بُحْرَةً,<br>\
(MF in art. بحر,) and صَحْرَةً بَحْرَةً نَحْرَةً, (O, K,)<br>\
and صَحْرَةَ بَحْرَةَ نَحْرَةَ, (K, [but this last is implicitly disallowed in the O, and expressly by<br>\
MF in art. بحر,]) and with damm also in all<br>\
these words, [i. e. صُحْرَة &amp;c.,] (K,) I met him<br>\
openly, or in open view, nothing intervening to<br>\
conceal him. (S, L, K. [See also بَحْرَةٌ; and see<br>\
صَرْحَةٌ.]) And one says likewise, أَخْبَرَهُ بِالأَمْرِ<br>\
صحرة بحرة [He acquainted him with the affair,<br>\
or case, openly]. (TA.)<br>\
صُحْرَةٌ (S, K, in the CK, صُحَرَةٌ [which is a<br>\
mistake,]) and ↓ صَحَرٌ (K [in some copies of the<br>\
K صَحْرٌ, which, as observed in the TA, is wrong,])<br>\
A colour in which is [the kind of red termed]<br>\
شُقْرَةٌ: (S:) or a colour nearly the same as [the<br>\
kind of red termed] صُبْهَةٌ: (K:) or the latter,<br>\
(TA, [and app. the former also,]) a dust-colour<br>\
with a slight redness, (in the K, in حُمْرَة خَفِيَّة,<br>\
the latter of these two words is a mistake for<br>\
خَفِيفَة, TA,) inclining to a little whiteness: (K,<br>\
TA:) or the former, redness inclining to dustcolour: (TA:) or dust-colour with redness: (A:)<br>\
and [redness of the kind termed] شُقْرَة in the<br>\
head: (As, TA:) and both words, a colour in<br>\
which is whiteness and redness: (TA:) and<br>\
whiteness overspreading blackness; like سُحْرَةٌ and<br>\
سَحَرٌ: (TA in art. سحر:) and the latter, accord.<br>\
to Sgh, whiteness. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, both words,<br>\
The quality of a صَحْرَآء [q. v.]. (ISh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
the former, A clear space in a [stony tract such<br>\
as is called] حَرَّة, (S, K,) consisting of soft and<br>\
clean soil with stones in it: (TA:) pl. صُحَرٌ; (S,<br>\
K;) the only pl. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also صَحْرَة.<br>\
صَحْرَآءُ, imperfectly decl., (S, K,) though not<br>\
an epithet; (S;) or it is an epithet in which the<br>\
quality of a subst. predominates; (TA;) and is<br>\
imperfectly decl. because it is of the fem. gender,<br>\
(S,) and because the letter characteristic of the<br>\
fem. gender [namely the long ا] is inseparable<br>\
from it, (S, K,) A desert; a waste; syn. بَرِّيَّةٌ:<br>\
(S, Msb:) or a tract of land like the back of a<br>\
beast, bare, or destitute of herbage, without trees<br>\
and without hills and without mountains; smooth<br>\
[throughout]: (ISh:) or a plain, or level tract of<br>\
land, with smoothness and ruggedness, (A, K,)<br>\
less [rugged] than what is termed قُفّ: (K:) or a<br>\
spacious tract of ground in which is no herbage:<br>\
(M, A, K:) or the most plain and even of land,<br>\
whether it have produced herbage or not, not<br>\
having any mountain or hill near it; as also<br>\
جَهَادٌ: (ISh, TA in art. جهد:) you say صَحْرَآءُ<br>\
وَاسِعَةٌ [a wide desert &amp;c.]; (S;) but you do not<br>\
say صَحْرَآءَةٌ, adding one fem. sign after another:<br>\
(S, Msb:) the pls. are صَحَارِىُّ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
صَحَارٍ (S, M, Msb) [in the K, صَحَارِى, which,<br>\
without the art. ال, and except when it is prefixed to another noun, and in a case of pausing,<br>\
is a manifest mistake, as is shown in every complete treatise on inflection,] and صَحَارَى (S, Msb,<br>\
K) and صَحْرَاوَاتٌ: (S, K:) the first of which<br>\
four pls. occurs in poetry, and is the original<br>\
form of the second: for when you form the pl. of<br>\
صَحْرَآءُ, [which is originally صَحْرَاا,] you introduce<br>\
an ا between the ح and the ر, and give kesr to the<br>\
ر as in all similar cases: then the first ا which is<br>\
after the ر [in صحراا] is changed into ى, because<br>\
of the kesreh preceding it; and the second ا,<br>\
which is the characteristic of the fem. gender, is<br>\
also changed into ى, and incorporated into the<br>\
former: then they reject the first ى, and change<br>\
the second into ا, [though still writing it ى,] and<br>\
say صَحَارَى, with fet-h to the ر, that the ا may<br>\
not be elided in the case of tenween, [which the<br>\
word would have if the ر were with kesr]; and<br>\
this they do to distinguish between the ى that is<br>\
changed from the ا which is a characteristic of the<br>\
fem. gender and the ى that is changed from the<br>\
ا which is not a characteristic of the fem. gender<br>\
as the ا of مَرْمًى when they say مَرَامٍ: some of the<br>\
Arabs, however, do not reject the first ى [in<br>\
صَحَارِىُّ], but reject the second ى, and say<br>\
الصَّحَارِى, with kesr to the ر, and هٰذِهِ صَحَارٍ, like<br>\
as you say جَوَارٍ (S. [In the Ham, p. 54, صُحَرٌ<br>\
is mentioned as a pl. of صَحْرَآءُ; but I think it<br>\
doubtful.])<br>\
صُحَارٌ The sweat of horses: (O, K:) or the<br>\
fever of horses. (K.) [―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1.]<br>\
صَحُورٌ: see أَصْحَرُ.<br>\
صَحِيرٌ A certain uttering of the voice of the<br>\
ass, (A, K,) of a vehement kind, (A,) more<br>\
vehement than the neighing of horses: an inf. n.<br>\
(TA. [See 1.])<br>\
صَحِيرَةٌ Milk into which heated stones are<br>\
thrown, so that it boils, after which some clarified<br>\
butter is poured upon it, and it is drunk; and<br>\
sometimes some flour is sprinkled upon it, and<br>\
then it is supped: or, accord. to Abu-l-Gheyth, it<br>\
is called صَخِيرَةٌ, from الصَّخْرُ; like فَهِيرَةٌ, from<br>\
الفِهْرُ: (S:) or fresh milk into which heated stones<br>\
are thrown, or which is put in the cooking-pot<br>\
and made to boil in it once, until it burns; and<br>\
sometimes flour is put into it, and sometimes<br>\
clarified butter: (TA:) or fresh milk which is<br>\
made to boil, after which some clarified butter is<br>\
poured upon it, (K,) and it is drunk: (TA:) or<br>\
fresh milk which is heated until it burns: (A:)<br>\
or pure milk of camels, or of sheep, or of goats,<br>\
which, when they want soup, and have not flour,<br>\
it not being found in their land, they cook, and<br>\
then give to drink to a sick person, hot. (TA.)<br>\
ثَوْبٌ صُحَارِىٌّ A kind of garment, so called in<br>\
relation to صُحَار, a town of El-Yemen: or, as<br>\
some say, of the colour termed صُحْرَة, like ↓ أَصْحَرُ.<br>\
(TA, from a trad.)<br>\
صُحَيْرَآءُ A certain sort of milk: (K:) so says<br>\
Kr, without particularizing it. (TA.)<br>\
أَصْحَرُ Of the colour termed صُحْرَة: (S, K:) or<br>\
similar to أَصْبَحٌ: (As:) a man of a red colour<br>\
inclining to dust-colour: (TA:) or having a<br>\
colour such as is termed شُقْرَة upon his head:<br>\
(As:) and an ass in which is a red colour: (S:)<br>\
or of a dust-colour with redness: (A:) or in<br>\
which is whiteness and redness; (TA;) and so<br>\
↓ صَحُورٌ applied to a she-ass; or this signifies<br>\
wont to kick with her hind leg: (K, TA:) fem.<br>\
صَحْرَآءُ: (S, TA:) and pl. صُحْرٌ. (TA.) See also<br>\
صُحَارِىٌّ. ―<br>\
-b2-  الأَصْحَرُ and ↓ المُصْحِرُ The lion. (Sgh,<br>\
K.)<br>\
المُصْحِرُ: see what next precedes.<br>\
مُصَاحِرٌ One who fights with his adversary in<br>\
the desert (الصَّحْرَآء), and does not act deceitfully<br>\
with him. (S.)<br>\
