صَارَ كَذَا, (T, S, Msb,) aor. يَصِيرُ, (S,) inf. n.<br>\
صَيْرُورَةٌ (S, Msb) and صَيْرٌ, (S,) He, or it, attained to the state, or condition, of such a thing;<br>\
(T;) became such a thing; (T, Msb;) in which<br>\
sense the verb is like كَانَ [in meaning, when the<br>\
latter is non-attributive, and in having its subject<br>\
in the nom. case and its predicate in the accus.].<br>\
(T.) You say, صَارَ زَيْدٌ رَجُلًا Zeyd became a man;<br>\
or attained to the state, or condition, of a man.<br>\
(TA.) And صَارَ زَيْدٌ غَنِيًّا Zeyd became rich, not<br>\
having been so. (Msb.) And صَارَ العَصِيرُ خَمْرًا<br>\
The expressed juice became wine. (Msb.) [And<br>\
صَارَ لَا شَىْءَ عِنْدَهُ He became in a state, or condition, in which there was not anything in his<br>\
possession. And صَارَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا He became in the<br>\
state, or condition, of doing such a thing; i. e. he<br>\
became occupied, or engaged, in doing such a<br>\
thing; or he set about, began, commenced, took<br>\
to, or betook himself to, doing such a thing; like<br>\
جَعَلَ. And صَارَ لَا يَفْعَلُ شَيْئًا He became in the<br>\
state, or condition, of not doing anything; or he<br>\
became unoccupied in doing anything. And<br>\
صَارَ لَا يَتَكَلَّمُ He became in the state of not<br>\
speaking; he became speechless. And صَارَ يَتَفَكَّرُ<br>\
فِى كَذَا He became in a state of reflection upon<br>\
such a thing; he began to reflect upon such a<br>\
thing.] ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, صَارَ الأَمْرُ إِلَى كَذَا, (M,<br>\
A, Msb, K,) aor. as above, (TA,) inf. n. مَصِيرٌ,<br>\
(S, M, A, Msb, K,) which is anomalous, being<br>\
regularly مَصَارٌ, like مَعَاشٌ, (S,) and صَيْرٌ and<br>\
صَيْرُورَةٌ, (M, A, K,) i. e. رَجَعَ إِلَيْهِ: (Msb:) [but<br>\
this is a loose explanation; the meaning being,<br>\
The thing, or affair, or case, came eventually (see<br>\
صِيرٌ) to such a state, or condition:] the difference<br>\
between مَصِيرٌ and مَرْجِعٌ is, that the former word<br>\
necessarily implies a difference [of the latter state<br>\
or condition] from the former state or condition;<br>\
but the latter word does not. (Bd in iii. 156.)<br>\
[In this case, the ulterior state or condition is<br>\
likened to a place: for] ―<br>\
-b3-  صَارَ also signifies He,<br>\
or it, attained in respect of place: so in the<br>\
saying, صَارَ زَيْدٌ إِلَى عَمْرٍو [Zeyd came, or went,<br>\
or pursued a course that brought him, to &#39;Amr].<br>\
(TA.) صِرْتُ إِلَى فُلَانٍ [I came, &amp;c., to such a<br>\
one] is similar to the phrase in the Kur [iii. 27]<br>\
وَإِلَى اللّٰهِ الْمَصِيرُ [And to God, as the ultimate<br>\
object, is the transition, or course, of every human<br>\
being]. (S.) [Hence, أًلَا إِلَى اللّٰهِ تَصِيرُ الْأُمُورُ, in<br>\
the Kur xlii. last verse, which Bd explains by<br>\
adding the words بِارْتِفَاعِ الوَسَائِطِ وَالتَّعَلُّقَاتِ; the<br>\
meaning being, Verily to God are things, or<br>\
events, referrible, mediately and dependently: in<br>\
the Expos. of the Jel expl. as meaning تَرْجِعُ.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
[And in like manner one says, صَارَ لَهُ كَذَا Such a<br>\
thing came to, betided, or befell, him, or it: and<br>\
hence, he, or it, came to have, or became possessed<br>\
of, such a thing.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And صَارَ فِى أَرْضِ فَلَاةٍ [He<br>\
became, or came to be, meaning he found himself,<br>\
in a desert, or waterless, land]; i. q. وَقَعَ فِيهَا.<br>\
(Msb in art. وقع.) And صَارَ فِى الرَّبِيعِ [He<br>\
entered, lit. became in, the season called ربيع];<br>\
i. q. أَرْبَعَ [which is expl. in the S as signifying<br>\
دَخَلَ فِى الرَّبِيعِ]. (K in art. ربع.)<br>\
-A2-  صَيْرٌ signifies also The returning of seekers after herbage to<br>\
the watering-places. (O, K.) And one says,<br>\
صَارَ الرَّجُلُ, aor. يَصِيرُ, [inf. n. صَيْرٌ,] The man<br>\
stayed, or abode, at the water. (TA.) And<br>\
صَارَ النَّاسُ المَآءَ The people stayed, or abode, at the<br>\
water. (M, K, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  صَارَهُ, (S,) first pers. صِرْتُهُ,<br>\
(M,) aor. as above, (S,) inf. n. صَيْرٌ, (K,) a dial.<br>\
var. of صَارَهُ having for its aor. يَصُورُهُ, [q. v.,] (S,)<br>\
He cut it; (S, M, K;) and clave it, or split it.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And in like manner, [i. e. as a dial. var.<br>\
of صَارَهُ having for its aor. يَصُورُهُ,] He made it to<br>\
incline, or lean. (S.) You say, صَارَ وَجْهَهُ, aor.<br>\
يَصِيرُ, (M,) as also يَصُورُ, (M and K in art. صور,)<br>\
He turned his face towards a person or thing.<br>\
(M.) And صِرْتُ عُنُقَهُ I twisted his neck. (M.)<br>\
[Respecting the phrase فَصِرْهُنَّ إِلَيْكَ in the Kur ii.<br>\
262, accord. to one reading, see 1 in art. صور.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
صَارَهُ, aor. يَصِيرُ, inf. n. صَيْرٌ, signifies also حَبَسَهُ<br>\
[He confined, restricted, &amp;c., him, or it]. (Msb.)<br>\
2<br>\
صيّرهُ كَذَا He made him, or it, to be in such<br>\
a state, or condition; or he made him, or it, to be<br>\
such a thing; [as also ↓ أَصَارَهُ;] syn. جَعَلَهُ. (S.)<br>\
You say, صَيَّرَنِى لَهُ عَبْدًا and ↓ أًصَارَنِى [He made<br>\
me to be to him a slave]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And صَيَّرَهُ إِلَى<br>\
كَذَا and ↓ أَصَارَهُ He, or it, made, or caused, him,<br>\
or it, to come, or to pursue a course that led, to<br>\
such a state, or condition; brought, or reduced,<br>\
him, or it, thereto.] &#39;Omeyleh El-Fezáree said<br>\
to his paternal uncle Ibn-&#39;Ankà, ↓ مَا الَّذِى أَصَارَكَ<br>\
إِلَى مَا أَرَى يَا عَمِّ [What hath made thee to come,<br>\
or brought thee, or reduced thee, to the state, or<br>\
condition, that I see, O my paternal uncle?].<br>\
(M.) [In this case, the ulterior state or condition<br>\
is likened to a place: for] you say, صَيَّرَهُ إِلَيْهِ and<br>\
↓ أَصَارَهُ [meaning He, or it, made him to come, or<br>\
brought him, to him, or it; i. e., to a person, or<br>\
place, or to a state, or condition:] (M, K:) and<br>\
صَيَّرَتْنِى إِلَيْهِ الحَاجَةُ and ↓ أَصَارَتْنِى [Want, or<br>\
need, or necessity, made me to come, or brought<br>\
me, to him, or it]. (A.) And [hence,] صَيَّرَ إِلَيْهِ<br>\
الأَمْرَ He committed to him the thing, or affair;<br>\
syn. فَوَّضَهُ اليه. (M in art. فوض.) [And صَيَّرَ لَهُ<br>\
كَذَا He made such a thing to come to, betide, or<br>\
befall, him, or it: and consequently, he made<br>\
him, or it, to have, or become possessed of, such a<br>\
thing.] ―<br>\
-b3-  تَصْيِيرٌ is also by word, or covenant, as<br>\
well as by deed. (Bd in ii. 20.) [You say, صَيَّرَهُ كَذَا<br>\
meaning He asserted, or pronounced, him, or it,<br>\
to be in such a state, or condition; or to be such a<br>\
thing: in which case, also, it is syn. with جَعَلَهُ,<br>\
whereby it is expl. in the S. And صَيَّرَ لَهُ كَذَا<br>\
He asserted, or pronounced, such a thing to belong to him, or it; asserted, or pronounced, him,<br>\
or it, to have such a thing; attributed to him, or<br>\
it, such a thing: and appointed or assigned, to<br>\
him, or it, such a thing.]<br>\

state, or condition; the end, conclusion, event,<br>\
issue, or result; of a thing, an affair, or a case;<br>\
(S, M, O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ صَيْرٌ (O, K) and<br>\
↓ مَصِيرٌ (S, O, Msb, TA) and ↓ مَصِيرَةٌ (TA) and<br>\
↓ صَيُّورٌ, (S, M, K,) of the measure فَيْعُولٌ, (S,) and<br>\
↓ صَيُّورَةٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The verge, brink, or point, of<br>\
an affair, or event. (M, K.) You say, أَنَا عَلَى<br>\

affair, or event. (M.) And أَنَا عَلَى صِيرٍ مِنْ حَاجَتِى<br>\

into the crevice of a door and has his eye put out,<br>\
