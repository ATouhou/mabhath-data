her, the fur of the colour termed صُهْبَة]; meaning<br>\

art. ضهب.) And A hard rock: and stones:<br>\

and he says that the صُهْب and أُدْم were called by<br>\
the Arabs “ the Kureysh of camels,” i. e. the<br>\
most noble, and the best, as Kureysh were considered by them the best of them; also, that صُهْبَة<br>\
was said to be the most famous and the best of<br>\
colours, and that a she-camel of that colour was<br>\
said to be the most swift of all: [see also أَحْمَرُ as<br>\
applied to a camel:] but accord. to As, آدَمُ applied to a camel signifies white; and أَصْهَبُ,<br>\
white intermixed with redness: (TA:) [see also<br>\

السِّبَالِ [lit. Persons red, or reddish, &amp;c., in respect<br>\

صُهْبُ السِّبَالِ: (As, S, A, * L, K:) originally applied to the Greeks (الرُّوم), because redness of<br>\
the hair was [common] among them, and they<br>\
were enemies of the Arabs: (S, L, TA:) applied<br>\
to others, it designates them as being as great<br>\
enemies as the Greeks. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  الأَصْهَبُ is an<br>\
appellation of The lion: (K:) because of his<br>\
colour. (TA.) ―<br>\
