صُغْرٌ and صَغَارٌ: (Mgh:) or صَغَارٌ signifies the<br>\
being small, or little, in estimation or rank or<br>\
dignity: (TA:) and you say, صَغُرَ فِى عُيُونِ النَّاسِ,<br>\
with damm, meaning, [he became small, or little,<br>\
in the eyes of men; i. e.,] he lost his reverence, or<br>\
reverend dignity. (Msb.) [See also 6.] One<br>\
says also, هُوَ يَصْغُرُ عَنْ كَذَا He, or it, is smaller<br>\
than, or too small for, such a thing; syn. يَقِلُّ.<br>\
(TA in art. قل.) And صَغُرَتْ عَنِ الوَلَدِ [She was<br>\

purposes: to denote the smallness of the thing<br>\
signified, in itself; as in the instance of دُوَبْرَةٌ [“ a<br>\
small, or little, house ”]: to denote its smallness<br>\
in the eye of the speaker, when it is not small in<br>\

affection and benevolence; as in the expression<br>\
يَا بُنَىَّ [“ O my little (meaning dear) son ”]: to<br>\
denote the greatness of the thing signified; as in<br>\
the phrase سُنَيَّةٌ حَمْرَآءُ [“ a very severe year ”]:<br>\
to denote praise; as when a man is described as<br>\
كُنَيْفٌ مُلِئَ عِلْمًا [“ a little pastor&#39;s-bag filled<br>\
with knowledge ”]: to denote blame; as in the<br>\
expression يَا فُوَيْسِقُ [“ O thou little transgressor ”].<br>\
(L, TA.) [The inf. n., تَصْغِيرٌ, is also applied to<br>\
A diminutive noun itself; as also اِسْمٌ مُصَغَّرٌ.] ―<br>\

(Sb, S, K) and أَصَاغِرَةٌ, (M, K,) though the sing.<br>\
is not of the nouns which regularly add ة to the<br>\

resembles in form قَشْعَمٌ, of which قَشَاعِمَةٌ is a pl.,<br>\
(ISd,) and أَصْغَرُونَ: (Sb, S:) and pl. fem. صُغَرٌ (Sb,<br>\
S, Msb) and صُغْرَيَاتٌ: (Msb:) but Sb says, you<br>\
do not say نِسْوَةٌ صُغَرٌ, nor قَوْمٌ أَصَاغِرُ, except with<br>\
the article ال: and he adds, we have heard the<br>\
Arabs says, الأَصَاغِرُ [perhaps miswritten for<br>\
الأَصَاغِرَةُ]; and if you please, you may say الأَصْغَرُونَ.<br>\

(TA.) You say, صَغَتْ إِلَيْهِ أُذُنُهُ His ear inclined to him, or it. (TA.) And hence, in the<br>\

صَغْوٌ: see the next preceding paragraph. [هٰذَا<br>\
