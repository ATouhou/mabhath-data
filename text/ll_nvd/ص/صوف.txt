صُوفٌ [Wool;] an appertenance of sheep, (in the<br>\
S لِلشَّاةِ, in the M لِلْغَنَمِ, and in the O and Msb<br>\
[more definitely] لِلضَّأْنِ,) which is to them like<br>\
شَعَرٌ to goats and وَبَرٌ to camels: (M:) [in the<br>\
K only said to be well know:] n. un. صُوفَةٌ,<br>\
(M,) [i. e.] this latter has a more particular signification [meaning a portion, flock, tuft, or wisp,<br>\
of wool]: (S, O, Msb, K:) and sometimes صُوفٌ<br>\
is used in the sense of the n. un., as mentioned by<br>\
Sb: (M:) the pl. of صُوفٌ is أَصْوَافٌ [meaning<br>\
sorts of wool]: (M:) and the dim. of the n. un. is<br>\
↓ صُوَيْفَةٌ. (TA.) One says خَرْقَآءُ وَجَدَتْ صُوفًا<br>\
[An unskilful woman that has found wool]: (As,<br>\
O, K:) a prov. (As, O) relating to property<br>\
possessed by such as does not deserve to have it:<br>\
(As, TA:) because the unskilful woman, when<br>\
she lights upon wool, mars it, (O, K,) not spinning it well: (O:) applied to the stupid person<br>\
who finds property and wastes it; (O, K;) or to<br>\
him who finds that of which he knows not the<br>\
value, and wastes it. (Z, TA.) And one says,<br>\
فُلَانٌ يَلْبَسُ الصُّوفَ وَالقُطْنَ, meaning Such a one<br>\
wears what is made of wool and of cotton. (A,<br>\
TA.) In the saying of a poet,<br>\
حَلْبَانَةٍ رَكْبَانَةٍ صَفُوفِ<br>\
تَخْلِطُ بَيْنَ وَبَرٍ وَصُوفِ<br>\
[Of one that is milked and ridden, that yields a<br>\
row of bowls of her milk, (but see صَفُوفٌ, of which<br>\
other explanations have been given,) that mingles<br>\
camels&#39; fur and wool], the latter hemistich means,<br>\
as Th says, accord. to IAar, that is sold, and with<br>\
the price whereof are purchased camels and sheep:<br>\
or, accord. to As, that is quick in her pace; the<br>\
drawing back of her fore legs being likened to<br>\
[the motion of] the bow of the نَدَّاف who mixes<br>\
camels&#39; fur and wool. (M.) One says also,<br>\
أَخَذْتُ بِصُوفِ رَقَبَتِهِ (S, M, K, but in the M أَخَذَ,)<br>\
and بِصُوفَتِهَا (M, O) and ↓ بِصَافِهَا, (M, K,) and<br>\
بِطُوفِ رَقَبَتِهِ and بِطَافِهَا, and بِظُوفِ زَقَبَتِهِ and<br>\
بِظَافِهَا, and بِقُوفِ رَقَبَتِهِ and بِقَافِهَا, (S, O,) meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  [I laid hold upon] the pendent hair in the hollow<br>\
of the back of his neck: (IDrd, S, M, O, K:) or<br>\
the downy hairs upon the back of his neck: (M,<br>\
O:) or the skin of his neck: (IAar, S, O, K:) or<br>\
the back of his neck, altogether: (Fr, S, O, K:)<br>\
or I took him by force: (Abu-l-Ghowth, S, O,<br>\
K:) or I followed him, thinking that I should<br>\
not reach him, and overtook him; and this one<br>\
says whether he lay hold upon his neck or not.<br>\
(Abu-s-Semeyda&#39;, S, O, K.) And أَعْطَاهُ بِصُوفِ<br>\
رَقَبَتِهِ (tropical:)  [He gave it altogether]; like أَعْطَاهُ بِرُمَّتِهِ:<br>\
or (as expl. by A&#39; Obeyd, S, O) he gave it gratuitously; not taking a price. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
صُوفُ البَحْرِ [lit. The wool of the sea] is a thing<br>\
[or substance] in the form of the animal صُوف<br>\
[i. e., of wool; evidently meaning sea-weed resembling wool; such as is found in abundance<br>\
thrown up on the beaches of the Red Sea: and<br>\
that this is generally, if not in every instance,<br>\
meant by the identical Hebrew word<br>\
סוּף, as used<br>\
in the Bible, has been most satisfactorily shown<br>\
in art. “ Red Sea ” (by my deeply-lamented<br>\
nephew Edward Stanley Poole) in Dr. William<br>\
Smith&#39;s “ Dictionary of the Bible ”]: it is said in<br>\
one of the أَبَدِيَّات, [see art. ابد,] لَا آتِيكَ مَا بَلَّ<br>\
بَحْرٌ صُوفَةً [I will not come to thee as long as a<br>\
sea wets a portion of صُوف], or, as Lh relates it,<br>\
مَا بَلَّ البَحْرُ صُوفَهُ [as long as the sea wets its<br>\
صُوف; meaning, ever]. (M, TA.)<br>\
صَوِفٌ: see صَافٌ.<br>\
صُوفَةٌ n. un. of صُوفٌ [q. v.]. (M &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also<br>\
applied by physicians to A pessary, or suppository, of wool, containing a medicament of some<br>\
kind, to be inserted into the vagina or rectum.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also Any of those who had the management of<br>\
aught of the work of the بَيْت [meaning the<br>\
House of God, i. e. the Kaabeh], and who were<br>\
called ↓ الصُّوفَانُ: (M:) [accord. to the TA, it is<br>\
said that الصُّوفَانُ and الصُّوفَةُ are both alike appel-lations applied to any of such persons:] J and<br>\
others say that صُوفَةٌ was the father of a tribe of<br>\
Mudar, who used to serve the Kaabeh, and to<br>\
return with the pilgrims from &#39; Arafát, in the Time<br>\
of Ignorance; and it is implied in the S [that they<br>\
were also called آلُ صُوفَانَ, or] that صُوفَة was<br>\
also called صُوفَان; and in a saying of Z, that<br>\
الصُّوفَان and آلُ صُوفَان were appellations of one<br>\
and the same people: [hence, app., the applications of صُوفَةٌ and صُوفَانٌ to any servants of the<br>\
Kaabeh:] but accord. to Sgh and the K, آلُ<br>\
صُوفَانَ is a mistake for آلُ صَفْوَانَ. (TA.)<br>\
صُوفَانٌ, and its fem., with ة: see صَافٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and<br>\
for the former see also صُوفَةٌ.<br>\
-A3-  Also [A species<br>\
of agaric, i. e., of the kind of fungus thus called;]<br>\
a certain thing [or substance] that comes forth<br>\
from the heart of trees, flaccid and dry, in which<br>\
fire is struck, and which is the best of things for<br>\
the purpose of those who strike fire. (TA.)<br>\
صُوفَانَةٌ, applied to a ewe, is fem. of صُوفَانٌ:<br>\
see صَافٌ. (AHeyth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A certain<br>\
herb, or leguminous plant, (بَقْلَةٌ,) downy, (M,<br>\
K,) and short, (K,) mentioned by Aboo-Nasr as<br>\
of the kind termed أَحْرَار [pl. of حُرٌّ], but not<br>\
specifically described by him. (AHn, M.)<br>\
صُوفِىٌّ, a post-classical word, A man of the<br>\
people called the صُوفِيَّة: (Msb:) [formerly applied to any devotee: afterwards, particularly, to<br>\
a mystic; one who seeks to raise himself to a high<br>\
degree of spiritual excellence by contemplation of<br>\
divine things so as to elicit the mysteries thereof:]<br>\
the صُوفِيَّة may be so called [from the Greek<br>\
sofo\s: or] in relation to the people called آلُ<br>\
صُوفَان, [see صُوفَةٌ,] as resembling them in the<br>\
devotion of themselves to religious exercises: or in<br>\
relation to those called أَهْلُ الصُّفَّةِ, wherefore they<br>\
are also called الصُّفِّيَّةُ: or in relation to الصُّوف<br>\
[i. e. wool], which is proper to devotees and<br>\
recluses: this last is the derivation commonly<br>\
received. (TA.)<br>\
صُوفَانِىٌّ; and its fem., with ة: see صَافٌ.<br>\
صُوَيْفَةٌ dim. of صُوفَةٌ, n. un. of صُوفٌ, q. v. (TA.)<br>\
صَوَّافٌ A manufacturer of صُوف [or wool, or of<br>\
woollen garments &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\

called] جُبَّة having much صُوف [or wool]. (TA.)<br>\
أَصْوَفُ: see صَافٌ.<br>\
