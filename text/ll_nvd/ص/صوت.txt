[They used to dislike blustering on the occasion of<br>\
combat, or fight]: meaning one&#39;s calling to<br>\

-A2-  [It is also trans.; as in the<br>\
phrase] اصات القَوْسَ He made the bow to sound<br>\

أَقْبَلَ شبابه; or the right explanation is, as though<br>\
he conformed with a prayer that his youthful<br>\
vigour might be restored to him; for] it is said, by<br>\
a poet, of Nasr Ibn-Duhmán, after he had lived a<br>\
hundred and ninety years, (S, O,) when, in answer<br>\
to a prayer of his people, his youthful vigour<br>\
returned to him and his hair became again black.<br>\
(O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also He went away hiding himself. (K.)<br>\
صَاتٌ: see صِيتٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also صَيِّتٌ, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
صَوْتٌ [an inf. n. (see 1): and also a simple<br>\
subst., signifying] A sound, (M, MA, TA, PS,)<br>\
a noise, a voice, a cry, a shout, an exclamation,<br>\
or a vociferation; (MA, PS;) of a human being<br>\
and of other things: (ISk, TA:) conventionally,<br>\
the sound of speech: (Msb:) [also a tone, considered with regard to the degree of elevation or<br>\
depression of the voice:] and any sort of singing:<br>\
(M, TA:) [and an air, or a song:] and it is used<br>\
to signify a clamour, or confused noise, or mixture<br>\
of sounds, (S,) and a cry for aid or succour: (S,<br>\
M:) the pl. is أَصْوَاتٌ: (M, Msb, TA:) it is<br>\
masc.: (S, * M, Msb, TA:) in the following verse,<br>\
(S, M, Msb,) of Ruweyshid Ibn-Ketheer (S, M)<br>\
Et-Tá-ee, (S,)<br>\
يَا أَيُّهَا الرَّاكِبُ المُزْجِى مَطِيَّتَهُ<br>\
سَايِلْ بَنِى أَسَدٍ مَا هٰذِهِ الصَّوْتُ<br>\
[O thou, the rider urging on his beast, ask the<br>\
sons of Asad what is this clamour?], (S, M,<br>\
Msb,) the poet has made الصوت fem. because<br>\
meaning thereby. الضَّوْضَآء and الجَلَبَة and الاِسْتِغَاثَة,<br>\
(S,) or he has made it fem. as meaning الصَّيْحَة,<br>\
(M, Msb,) or الاِسْتِغَاثَة: (M:) the like is often<br>\
done by the Arabs, when two words, masc. and<br>\
fem., are syn.: thus they say, أَقْبَلَتِ العِشَآءُ,<br>\
meaning العَشِيَّةُ; and هٰذَا العَشِيَّةُ, meaning العِشَآءُ:<br>\
(Msb:) but the making a masc. n. fem. for this<br>\
reason is bad; though the reverse is held to be<br>\
allowable. (M.) The Arabs say, أَسْمَعُ صَوْتًا<br>\
وَأَرَى فَوْتًا, meaning I hear a sound, or voice, but<br>\
I see not a deed. (TA.) بِصَوْتِكَ in the Kur<br>\
xvii. 66 is said to mean With the sounds of [thy]<br>\
singing, and musical pipes. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اِسْمُ<br>\
صَوْتٍ is a term applied to A noun significant of a<br>\
sound: nouns of this kind being of two classes;<br>\
namely, nouns applied to the purpose of addressing<br>\
irrational beings, or what are virtually in the<br>\
predicament of irrational beings, as young infants; and onomatopœias, or nouns imitative of<br>\
sounds: the former class consists of two descriptions of words; namely, ejaculations used for the<br>\
purpose of chiding, as هَلَا (to horses) and عَدَسْ<br>\
(to mules) and كِخْ كِخْ (to a young infant);<br>\
and ejaculations used for the purpose of calling,<br>\
as جِىْء (to camels) and تُشَأْ (to an ass): of the<br>\
other class are غَاقِ (imitative of the cry of the<br>\
crow) and طَقْ (imitative of the sound produced by<br>\
the falling of stones) and قبْ (imitative of the<br>\
sound produced by the fall of a sword) &amp;c.:<br>\
nouns significant of sounds are generally indecl.,<br>\
because they resemble certain particles in neither<br>\
governing nor being governed; but some of them<br>\
are occasionally decl. [like other nouns]. (ElAshmoonee&#39;s Expos. of the Alfeeyeh of Ibn-Málik, section اسماء الافعال والاصوات.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See<br>\
also the next paragraph, in four places.<br>\
صِيتٌ (S, M, A, Msb, K) and ↓ صَوْتٌ (S, M, A,<br>\
K) and ↓ صَاتٌ (M, K) and ↓ صِيتَةٌ (K) Fame,<br>\
report, repute, or reputation, whether good or<br>\
evil: (TA:) or good fame, good report, good<br>\
repute or reputation, (S, M, Msb, K,) that spreads<br>\
(S) among the people; (S, Msb;) so some say;<br>\
(TA;) not evil: (S:) [they may often be well<br>\
rendered renown:] صِيتٌ is originally صِوْتٌ; the<br>\
و being changed into ى on account of the kesreh<br>\
preceding it: it seems as though they made it to<br>\
be of the measure فِعْلٌ to distinguish between the<br>\
صَوْت that is heard and the fame &amp;c. that is<br>\
known: but sometimes they said, فِى ↓ اِنْتَشَرَ صَوْتُهُ<br>\
النَّاسِ in the sense of صِيتُهُ [i. e. His fame &amp;c., or<br>\
good fame &amp;c., spread among the people]: (S,<br>\
TA:) and فِى النَّاسِ ↓ لَهُ صَوْتٌ and صِيتٌ [He<br>\
has fame &amp;c., or good fame &amp;c., among the<br>\
people]: and ذَهَبَ صِيتُهُ فِيهِمْ [His fame &amp;c., or<br>\
good fame &amp;c., went among them]. (A.) It<br>\
is said in a trad., مَا مِنْ عَبْدٍ إِلَّا لَهُ صِيتٌ فِى السَّمَآءِ,<br>\
meaning [There is no servant of God, i. e. no man,<br>\
but he has] a report by which he is known [in<br>\
Heaven]; and it may be in respect of good and<br>\
evil. (TA.) And in another trad., فَصْلُ مَا بَيْنَ<br>\
وَالدَّفٌ ↓ الحَلَالِ وَالحَرَامِ الصَّوْتُ [The distinction<br>\
between the lawful (i. e. marriage) and the<br>\
unlawful (i. e. fornication) is the report that is<br>\
made in the case of the former, and the tambourine that is used in that case], meaning the<br>\
publication of the marriage, and the going of the<br>\
report thereof among the people. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  صِيتٌ<br>\
also signifies A blacksmith&#39;s hammer. (K, * TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And An artificer, or a handicraftsman; syn.<br>\
صَانِعٌ: (K accord. to the TA:) or a goldsmith;<br>\
syn. صَائِغٌ. (So in the CK and in my MS. copy<br>\
of the K.)<br>\
صِيتَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
صَائِتٌ [Sounding; making, producing, emitting,<br>\
sending forth, or uttering, a sound, noise, voice,<br>\
or cry; (see its verb, صات;)] raising his voice,<br>\
calling or calling out, crying or crying out,<br>\
shouting, exclaiming, or vociferating; (S, Msb,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ صَيِّتٌ; the two words being like<br>\
مَائِتٌ and مَيِّتٌ; the latter originally صَيْوِتٌ.<br>\
(TA. [But see the next paragraph: and see also<br>\
مِصْوَاتٌ.])<br>\
صَيِّتٌ, applied to a man, (S, M, A, Msb, K,)<br>\
and ↓ صَاتٌ, so applied, (S, M, K,) and the latter<br>\
likewise applied to an ass, (S,) both signify the<br>\
same, (K,) Vehement, strong, or loud, of voice:<br>\
(S, M, Msb:) ↓ رَجُلٌ صَاتٌ is like رَجُلٌ مَالٌ “ a<br>\
man having much property,” and رَجُلٌ نَالٌ “ a<br>\
man who gives much,” and كَبْشٌ صَافٌ [“ a ram<br>\
having much wool ”], &amp;c., all of these epithets<br>\
being originally of the measure فَعِلٌ: (S:) or<br>\
صَاتٌ may be of the measure فَاعِلٌ from which<br>\
the medial radical has gone; or it may be [originally صَوِتٌ,] of the measure فَعِلٌ. (M.) One says<br>\
also صَوْتٌ صَيِّتٌ [A vehement, strong, or loud,<br>\
voice]. (A.) See also صَائِتٌ.<br>\
صَوَّاتٌ: see مِصْوَاتٌ.<br>\
مُصَوِّتٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
مِصْوَاتٌ One who raises his voice, calls or calls<br>\
out, cries or cries out, shouts, clamours, exclaims,<br>\
or vociferates; i. q. ↓ مُصَوِّتٌ: (K, TA:) [or, as<br>\
also ↓ صَوَّاتٌ, often occurring, who does so much,<br>\
or is in the habit of doing so; each being of a<br>\
measure denoting intensiveness of the signification.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, مَا بِالدَّارِ مِصْوَاتٌ,<br>\
meaning There is not in the house any one (K,<br>\
TA) that raises his voice, &amp;c.: in some copies of<br>\
the K ↓ مُصَوِّتٌ, which has the same meaning.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُنْصَاتٌ Straight in stature. (S.)<br>\
