صَلِفَ السَّحَابُ, [aor.<br>\
صَلَفَ,] inf. n. صَلَفٌ, The<br>\
clouds had in them no water: (M:) or صَلِفَتِ<br>\
السَّحَابَةُ the cloud had little water. (A, TA. [It<br>\
is implied in the TA that this is tropical; but I<br>\
doubt its being so.]) See also its part. n., صَلِفٌ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  صَلِفَ said of a man&#39;s حَرْث [or seed-produce],<br>\
It did not increase, or multiply, or become plentiful or abundant. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  صَلَفٌ as a quality of<br>\
طَعَام [or wheat] signifies Its having little increase<br>\
(نُزْل, S, or نَزَل, L, or نَمَآء and بَرَكَة, K) and little<br>\

sense expl. in the next sentence below,] مَنْ يَبْغِ,<br>\
فِى الدِّينِ يَصْلَفْ, (S, M, Meyd, &amp;c.,) a prov., (S,<br>\
Meyd, O, K,) relating to the holding fast to religion, (S,) or used in urging to the mixing in<br>\
social intercourse with the holding fast to religion,<br>\

accord. to As, He who exceeds the right bounds<br>\
in religion (Meyd) will not be in favour with<br>\
men, or beloved by them; (S, Meyd;) or will have<br>\
little increase therein: (M:) or he who finds<br>\
fault with men in respect of religion, (O, K,) and<br>\
regards it as an excellence [that he possesses]<br>\
above them, will have little goodness in their estimation, and (O) will not be in favour with them,<br>\
or beloved by them: (O, K:) or the meaning is,<br>\
he who seeks worldly good by means of religion,<br>\
his share of the former will be little: (Meyd:) or<br>\
he who seeks, in respect of religion, more than he<br>\
has had revealed to him, his share will be little.<br>\
(IAth.) ―<br>\
-b5-  صَلِفَتْ, (S, M, O,) aor.<br>\
صَلَفَ, (S, O,)<br>\
inf. n. صَلَفٌ, said of a woman, means She was not<br>\
in favour with, or was not beloved by, (S, M, O,<br>\

(O, K,) likewise in a man and in a woman, (O,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The commending, or praising, oneself for, or the<br>\

O,) the overpassing the due limits in الظَّرْف [here<br>\
meaning elegance of mind, manners, address,<br>\
speech, person, attire, and the like], (S, M, O, K,)<br>\
and in excellence in knowledge or courage or other<br>\
qualities, (TA,) and arrogating to oneself more<br>\
than is due, through pride: (S, O, K:) but some<br>\
say that this is post-classical: (M, TA:) [see an<br>\
ex. voce آفَةٌ, in art. اوف; mentioned here in the<br>\
TA as occurring in a trad.:] one says, of a man,<br>\
صَلِفَ, (M, MA,) inf. n. صَلَفٌ, (M,) meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He commended, or praised, himself [&amp;c.];<br>\
(MA;) and ↓ تصلّف, (S, MA, O,) meaning the<br>\
same; (MA;) or this latter means تَكَلَّفَ الصَّلَفَ,<br>\
(K, TA,) i. e. [he affected the overpassing of the<br>\
due limits in الظَّرْف (meaning as expl. above);<br>\
or he took upon himself as a task] the arrogating<br>\

(TA:) [you say, تصلّف بِمَا لَيْسَ عِنْدَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He commended, or praised, himself for, or he boasted of,<br>\
or gloried in, that which he did not possess:] the<br>\
epithet from the former verb is ↓ صَلِفٌ, (AZ, S,<br>\
M, O, K,) applied to a man, (AZ, S, M, O,) and<br>\
صَلِفَةٌ applied to a woman; (M;) and the pl. of<br>\
صَلِفٌ is صَلَافَى (AZ, M, K) and صُلَفَآءُ and صَلِفُونَ:<br>\
(AZ, O, K:) it is said to be from صَلِفٌ applied<br>\
to a vessel, accord. to IAar as meaning “ that<br>\
takes little water; ” but rather, as others say, as<br>\
meaning “ thick and heavy: ” the vulgar misapply it [app. by using it in the sense assigned<br>\
to it by IAar]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also the next<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
اصلف i. q. قَلَّ خَيْرُهُ [His good things became few; or his wealth, or his goodness or beneficence, became little]: (IAar, O, K:) and (TA)<br>\
so ↓ تصلّف. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And His soul, or spirit,<br>\
(رُوحُهُ,) became heavy; (IAar, O, K;) and he<br>\
became oppressed as though by the nightmare.<br>\

in favour with him, or not beloved by him. (M.)<br>\

as also ↓ صَلِفَهَا, (so in a copy of the M,) or صَلَفَهَا,<br>\
aor.<br>\
صَلِفَ; (so in the L and TA;) the latter mentioned by IAmb: (L,TA:) or اصلفهُ he hated<br>\
him, namely, another man. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And اصلف نِسَآءَهُ He divorced his wives: and<br>\
he made their share of his favours to be small.<br>\
(A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And one says to a woman, أَصْلَفَ<br>\
اللّٰهُ رُفْغَكِ, meaning May God make thee [or thy<br>\
فَرْج or the like] to be hated by thy husband. (EshSheybánee, S, O, K.)<br>\
-A3-  اصلف القَوْمُ, (thus in the<br>\
O, on the authority of Ibn-&#39;Abbád, [like أَحْزَنَ,<br>\
and its contr. أَسْهَلَ, &amp;c.,]) or ↓ تصلّف, (thus in<br>\
the K, [but the former is preferable on the ground<br>\
of analogy, and the latter I think a mistake,])<br>\
The people, or party, became in the [kind of tract<br>\
termed] صَلْفَآء. (O, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تصلّف: see 4, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  And see 1,<br>\
latter part. ―<br>\

affectionate, and a blandishing, or coaxing,<br>\
manner. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And, said of a camel, He<br>\
loathed, or turned away with disgust from, the<br>\
[pasturage termed] خُلَّة, and inclined to the حَمْض.<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 4, last sentence.<br>\
الصَّلْفُ The branches of the heart of the palmtree that are next belong the قِلَبَة: [in the CK,<br>\
خَواءٌ فى قُلْبِ النَّخْلَةِ is erroneously put for خَوَافِى;<br>\
قلبِ النّخلةِ; and the same mistake was originally<br>\
made in my MS. copy of the K:] n. un. with ة.<br>\
(IAar, O, K, * TA. [See خَافِيَةٌ, last sentence.]<br>\
صَلِفٌ, applied to clouds (سَحَاب, S, M, O, K),<br>\
Containing no water: (M:) or having little<br>\
water and much thunder. (S, O, K. [Said in the<br>\
TA to be tropical; but I doubt its being so.]) It<br>\
is said in a prov., رُبَّ صَلِفٍ تَحْتَ الرَّاعِدَةِ, (S, and<br>\
so in some copies of the K,) or ↓ رُبَّ صَلَفٍ, (M,<br>\
O, and so in some copies of the K, [with an<br>\
inf. n. in the place of an epithet,]) i. e. Many a<br>\
cloud is there, [or many clouds are there, lacking<br>\
rain, or] having much thunder with little rain,<br>\
[beneath that which thunders:] (A&#39;Obeyd, O:)<br>\
applied to the wealthy niggard: (A&#39;Obeyd, O, K:)<br>\
or to him who threatens, and does not perform<br>\
what he threatens: (S, O, K:) or to him who<br>\
commends himself much, (M, O, K,) and is loquacious, (M, O,) but is destitute of good. (M,<br>\
O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A vessel that takes little water:<br>\
(IAar, S, M, O, K:) a small vessel: one that<br>\
leaks; that will not hold water. (IAar, TA.<br>\
[This, also, is said in the TA to be tropical.])<br>\
And A heavy (K, TA) and thick (TA) vessel.<br>\
(K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also High ground (قُفّ), or a hard<br>\
plain, that produces no plants or herbage: (TA:)<br>\
and so the fem., with ة, applied to land (أَرْض).<br>\
(M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Wheat (طَعَام) having little increase<br>\
(قَلِيلُ النَّزَلِ and الرَّيْعِ): (M:) or tasteless: (M,<br>\
O, K:) and ↓ صَلِيفٌ signifies the same, in the<br>\
former sense or in the latter. (M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And [A<br>\
man] heavy in soul, or spirit; syn. ثَقِيلُ الرُّوحِ.<br>\
(TA. [See 4, second sentence, which shows that<br>\
مُصْلِفٌ has this meaning: but the epithet thus<br>\
expl. in the TA is there said to be like كَتِفٌ.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And صَلِفَةٌ signifies A woman not in favour<br>\
with, or not beloved by, (S, M, O, K,) her husband,<br>\
(S, O, K,) or him by whom she is supported;<br>\
(M;) and hated by him: (S, O:) pl. صَلَائِفُ, (S,<br>\
M, O, K,) which is extr. [in respect of analogy],<br>\
(M,) and صَلِفَاتٌ. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  See also 1, near the<br>\
end.<br>\
صَلْفَآء and صِلْفَآء, and each with ة: see أَصْلَفُ,<br>\
in five places.<br>\
صَلِيفٌ The side (عُرْض [in one of my copies of<br>\
the S عَرْض, and in the other copy عِرق,]) of the<br>\
neck; the two being called صَلِيفَانِ; (S, O, K;)<br>\
[i. e.] الصَّلِيفَانِ signifies the two sides of the neck<br>\
(جَانِبَا العُنُقِ): or this signifies what are between<br>\
the لِيت [or part beneath the earring] and the<br>\
قَصَرَة [or base of the neck, on the two sides]: (M:)<br>\
or the two heads of the vertebra that is next to the<br>\
head, in the two sides of the neck. (AZ, O, * K, *<br>\
TA.) In this last explanation, in the copies of<br>\
the K, رأس is put for رأسا. (TA. [And in some<br>\
copies of the K, شِقَّيْهِمَا is there erroneously put for<br>\
شِقَّيْهَا, which, as is said in the TA, refers to the<br>\
neck.]) أَخَذَ بِصَلِيفِهِ and ↓ بِصَلِيفَتِهِ mean, accord.<br>\
to As, He took hold of the back of his neck:<br>\
(O, TA:) and one says also, ↓ أَخَذَهُ بِصَلِيفَتِهِ<br>\
meaning He took him, or it, altogether. (TA.<br>\
[But I think it not improbable that ↓ بِصَلِيفَتِهِ in<br>\
these two instances may be a mistranscription for<br>\
بِصَلِيفَيْهِ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  الصَّلِيفَانِ signifies also Two staves,<br>\
or pieces of wood, which are placed across [horizontally] upon the [camel&#39;s saddle called] غَبِيط, by<br>\
means of which the مَحَامِل [pl. of مَحْمِلٌ, q. v.,]<br>\
are bound. (S, O, K.) And (TA) صَلِيفَا الإِكَافِ<br>\
signifies The two [similar] pieces of wood that are<br>\
bound upon the upper part of the [saddle called]<br>\
إِكَاف. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also صَلِفٌ, latter half.<br>\
صَلِيفَةٌ: see صَلِيفٌ, in three places.<br>\
صَلَنْفًى and صَلَنْفَآءٌ A loquacious man. (M,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
أَصْلَفُ Hard, applied to a place; and so [the<br>\
fem.] ↓ صَلْفَآءُ applied to land (أَرْض): (S, O:) or<br>\
both signify hard ground (M, K) containing<br>\
stones; (M;) or hard and rugged ground; (As,<br>\
O;) and the pl. is صَلَافٍ, (M, O, K, * [in the last,<br>\
erroneously, صَلَافِى, and in the O, correctly,<br>\
الصَّلَافِى, being made determinate,]) thus pluralized<br>\
in the same manner as صَحْرَآء because the quality<br>\
of a subst. is predominant therein, (M,) and [for<br>\
the same reason] أَصَالِفُ also; (O, K;) [the former<br>\
pl. of صلفآء, and the latter of اصلف:] or ↓ صَلْفَآء<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K) and ↓ صِلْفَآء, [each, app.,<br>\
with tenween, the latter because of the measure<br>\
فِعْلَآء, and each because receiving the affix ة, for<br>\
it is added,] and likewise ↓ صَلْفَآءَةٌ (K) and<br>\
↓ صِلْفَآءَةٌ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K,) rugged, hard<br>\
ground: (K:) or a smooth rock, or a hard, smooth,<br>\
bare rock, even with the ground. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád,<br>\
O, K.)<br>\
مُصْلِفٌ A man whose wife is not in favour with<br>\
him or not beloved by him. (IAar, M, O, K.)<br>\
