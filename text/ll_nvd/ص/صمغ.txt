صمّغهُ, inf. n. تَصْمِيغٌ, He put صَمْغ [i. e.<br>\
gum] into it; (O, K;) meaning, into ink. (O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And صمّغ بِالصَّمْغِ, inf. n. as above, He compacted the hair of his head [with gum]. (Msb.)<br>\
4<br>\
اصمغت الشَّجَرَةُ The tree produced صَمْغ<br>\
[i. e. gum]. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence<br>\
one says, يُصْمِغُ فُوهُ His mouth is discharging<br>\
like a tree producing gum, and in like manner<br>\
أُذُنَاهُ his two ears, and عَيْنَاهُ his two eyes, and<br>\
أَنْفُهُ his nose. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.) And اصمغ<br>\
شِدْقُهُ The side of his mouth produced much<br>\
spittle. (O, K.) And اصمغ الرَّجُلُ (tropical:)  The man had<br>\
foam coming forth upon the sides of his mouth.<br>\
(Har p. 618.) And اصمغت الشَّاةُ is said of the<br>\
sheep or goat when her biestings are fresh (كَانَ<br>\
لِبَؤُهَا طَرِيًّا, Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, TA, in the K لَبَنُهَا, but<br>\
the former is the right, TA) [i. e. The sheep, or<br>\
goat, yielded fresh biestings] on the first occasion<br>\
of her being milked. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استصمغ الصَّابَ He scarified the species of<br>\
tree that produces صاب [q. v.] (S, O, K) in order<br>\
that its غِرَآء [meaning mucilage] might issue, (K,<br>\
TA,) i. e. (TA) in order that a certain bitter<br>\
substance might issue from it, and concrete like<br>\
صَبِر [i. e. aloes]: (S, O, TA:) thus expl. by Abu-I-Ghowth. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  And استصمغ He had a<br>\
صَمْغَة, i. e. a small swelling, or pustule. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
صَمْغٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ صَمَغٌ, (K,) the<br>\
latter mentioned by ISd on the authority of AHn,<br>\
(TA,) [Gum; i. e.] the fluid that exudes from<br>\
the trees called عِضَاه and the like of these: (Msb:)<br>\
it is of many sorts: (S, O:) that which is called<br>\
الصَّمْغُ العَرَبِىُّ is the صَمْغ of the طَلْح, (S, O,<br>\
Msb,) which is said to be the same [tree] that is<br>\
called أُمُّ غَيْلَانَ: (Msb:) or the mucilage (غِرَآء)<br>\
of the [tree called] قَرَظ [and more commonly<br>\
سَنْط, i. e. the mimosa Nilotica, also called acacia<br>\
Nilotica]; and this is what is called الصَّمْغُ العَرَبِىُّ;<br>\
not the صَمْغ of the طَلْح; J [and others] having<br>\
erred [in asserting it to be this]: [but] every tree<br>\
also has صَمْغ: (K: [this last assertion, however,<br>\
is questionable; for صَمْغ seems to signify properly<br>\
gum, or juice that exudes from certain trees<br>\
and concretes:]) the n. un., (Msb, TA,) or term<br>\
applied to a portion thereof, (S, O,) is صَمْغَةٌ (S,<br>\
O, Msb, TA) and صَمَغَةٌ: (TA:) and the pl. is<br>\
صُمُوغٌ: (S, O, Msb, K:) among صُمُوغ [i. e. sorts<br>\
of صَمْغ], the مُقْل [q. v.] is said to be included;<br>\
but this is not known. (AHn, TA.) It is said in<br>\
a prov., تَرَكْتُهُ عَلَى مِثْلِ مَقْرِفِ الصَّمْغَةِ [I left him<br>\
in a condition like that of the place where the<br>\
piece of gum has been pared off]: this is when<br>\
one has left a person nothing; for the صمغة is<br>\
plucked off from its tree until there remains not<br>\
upon it what would retain one&#39;s life: (S, O:) or,<br>\
as some relate it, عَلَى مِثْلِ مَقْلَعِ الصَّمْغَةِ [in a<br>\
condition like that of the place where the piece of<br>\
gum has been plucked off]; (O, and so Meyd;)<br>\
meaning, without anything remaining to him;<br>\
because, when the gum is plucked off, there<br>\
remains not any trace of it. (Meyd.) And in a<br>\
trad. of El-Hajjáj occurs the saying, لَأَقْلَعَنَّكَ قَلْعَ<br>\
الصَّمْغَةِ [I will assuredly pluck thee away with the<br>\
plucking away of the piece of gum]; meaning I<br>\
will assuredly extirpate thee. (TA.) [―<br>\

صِمَغٌ (AZ, O, K) and ↓ صِمَغَةٌ, (K,) or the<br>\
latter is the n. un. of the former, and in like<br>\
manner صِمَخٌ and صِمَخَةٌ, the latter being the<br>\
n. un., (AZ, O,) or ↓ صِمْغٌ and صِمْخٌ, of which<br>\
↓ صِمْغَةٌ and صِمْخَةٌ are the ns. un., (Az, on the<br>\
authority of A &#39;Obeyd, TA,) A dry substance<br>\
which is found upon the teats (AZ, Az, O, K) of<br>\
a she-camel (AZ, O, K) or of a ewe or she-goat,<br>\
(Az, TA,) when she is milked on the occasion of<br>\
her bringing forth: (AZ, Az, O:) when that is<br>\
rent asunder (إِذَا فُطِرَ ذٰلِكَ [in the CK قُطِرَ]), the<br>\
milk is clear and sweet. (AZ, O, K.)<br>\
صَمْغَةٌ A small swelling, or pustule; syn. قَرْحَةٌ.<br>\

لَقِيتُ صَمْغَانَ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K,) and أَبَا<br>\
↓ صِمْغَةَ, (K,) I met him whose mouth and ears<br>\
and eyes and nose were discharging like the tree<br>\
producing gum. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
الصِّمَاغَانِ: see what next follows, in two places.<br>\
الصَّامِغَانِ, (IDrd, S, O, K,) like السَّامِغَانِ,<br>\
[q. v.,] (IDrd, O,) but the former is said by Mtr<br>\
to be better known, (Har p. 618,) and ↓ الصِّمَاغَانِ,<br>\
(AO, O, K,) and ↓ الصِّمْغَانِ, (Lth, O, K,) The<br>\
two sides of the mouth, (S, O, K,) where the lips<br>\
meet [and conjoin], next the شِدْقَانِ: (O, K:) or<br>\
the two places where the spittle collects in the<br>\
two sides of the lip; (IAar, O, K;) called by the<br>\
vulgar الصَّوَارَيْن, (O in this art.,) or الصَّوَّارَيْن,<br>\
for الصِّوَارَانِ: (O and TA in art. صور:) or, as<br>\
some say, [strangely,] the hinder part of the<br>\
mouth. (TA.) It is said in a trad. that the<br>\
↓ صِمَاغَانِ are the two places where sit the two<br>\
angels [that note and record the actions of a<br>\
man]: a saying enjoining the use of the سِوَاك.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
لَبَنٌ مُصْمِغٌ [app. Milk that is gummy; describing biestings not yet clear]. (TA voce<br>\

in the copies of the K, erroneously, بِلَبَنِهَا, (TA,)<br>\
A ewe, or she-goat, yielding fresh biestings on the<br>\
first occasion of her being milked. (O, K, * TA.)<br>\
حِبْرٌ مُصَمَّغٌ Ink made with [the addition of]<br>\
صَمْغ [or gum]: but [J says] I know not from<br>\
whom I heard this. (S.)<br>\
