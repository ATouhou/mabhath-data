صُعْتُهُ, (O, K,) [from صَاعَهُ,] aor. أَصُوعُهُ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. صَوْعٌ, (TA,) I measured it with the<br>\
صَاع [q. v.]. (O, K.) One says, هٰذَا طَعَامٌ يُصَاعُ<br>\
i. e. [This is wheat] that is measured [with the<br>\
صاع]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  [I collected it together,<br>\
like as the measurer collects the corn &amp;c. in the<br>\
measure: and the contr., i. e.] I dispersed it, or<br>\
scattered it; (S, O, K;) in which sense it is [said<br>\
to be] tropical; (TA;) and صِعْتُهُ, aor. أَصِيعُهُ, (K<br>\
in art. صيع,) inf. n. صَيْعٌ, (TA in that art.,)<br>\
signifies the same. (K in that art.) One says,<br>\
صُعْتُ الأَقْرَانَ, and غَيْرَهُمْ, (tropical:)  I came to the antagonists, and others, from their sides: (K, TA:)<br>\
of a courageous man, or a courageous armed man,<br>\
one says, يَصُوعُ أَقْرَانَهُ (tropical:)  He comes to his antagonists from their sides; (S, O, TA;) and the like<br>\
is cited in the T from Lth; or as meaning he<br>\
encompasses their sides; (TA;) or he collects<br>\
together his antagonists (IKtt, Z, TA) from every<br>\
side, (IKtt, TA,) like as the measurer collects<br>\
together that which is measured: (Z, TA:) and of<br>\
a man, (S, O,) or a pastor, (Lth, IKtt, Z,) يَصُوعُ<br>\
الإِبِلَ, (S, O,) or مَاشِيَتَهُ, (Lth,) or إِبِلَهُ, (IKtt, Z,)<br>\
(tropical:)  He comes [to the camels or] to his cattle [or to<br>\
his camels] from their sides; or he encompasses<br>\
their sides; (Lth, TA;) or he collects them together (IKtt, Z, TA) from every side, (IKtt,<br>\
TA,) like as the measurer collects together that<br>\
which is measured: (Z, TA:) but Az says that the<br>\
foregoing explanations by Lth are wrong; that<br>\
يَصُوعُ أَقْرَانَهُ, said of a courageous man, or a<br>\
courageous armed man, means he charges upon his<br>\
antagonists and disperses them; and يَصُوعُ إِبِلَهُ,<br>\
said of a pastor, he disperses his camels in the<br>\
place of pasture; and يَصُوعُ المَعَزَ, said of a hegoat, he disperses the [she-] goats; and صَاعَ الغَنَمَ,<br>\
aor. as above, and so the inf. n., he dispersed the<br>\
sheep or goats; (TA;) and الغَنَمَ ↓ اصاع, inf. n.<br>\
إِصَاعَةٌ, signifies thus likewise: (Lh, TA in art.<br>\
صيع:) Lh also says that صُعْتُ الغَنَمَ, aor. أَصُوعُهَا,<br>\
inf. n. صَوْعٌ, and صِعْتُهَا, aor. أَصِيعُهَا, inf. n. صَيْعٌ,<br>\
both signify I dispersed the sheep or goats: (O in<br>\
art. صيع:) or, accord. to IKtt, صاع إِبِلَهُ, said of<br>\
a pastor, has two contr. meanings; he collected<br>\
together his camels from every side; and also he<br>\
dispersed his camels. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also I frightened<br>\
him. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, * O, * K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And صُعْتُ القَوْمَ,<br>\
aor. أَصُوعُهُمْ, (Lh, O in art. صيع,) inf. n. صَوْعٌ,<br>\
(TA in that art.,) I urged, or incited, the people,<br>\
or party; (Lh, O and TA in that art.;) and so<br>\
صِعْتُ القَوْمَ, (Lh, O and K in that art.,) aor.<br>\
أَصِيعُهُمْ, (Lh, O ibid.,) inf. n. صَيْعٌ. (TA ibid.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  [And صاع الكُرَةَ He propelled the ball with the<br>\
صَوْلَجَان. (See صَاعٌ below, last sentence.)] ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
And صَاعَتِ النَّحْلُ, (K,) [app. for صاعت النحل<br>\
بَعْضُهَا بَعْضًا,] aor. تَصُوعُ, (O,) inf. n. صَوْعٌ, (TA,)<br>\
The bees followed [as though driving along] one<br>\
another. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And صاع الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. صَوْعٌ,<br>\

bent it. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\

She (a woman) prepared a place, such as is<br>\
termed صَاعَة, (O, K, TA,) and made it even,<br>\
(TA,) for the separating and loosening of cotton.<br>\
(O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  صوّعت الرِّيحُ النَّبَاتَ The wind dried<br>\
up, or caused to dry up, the plants, or herbage;<br>\
(O, K;) as also صَوَّحَتْهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  صوّع الشَّىْءَ<br>\
He made the thing pointed in its head. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And He rounded the thing in its<br>\
sides. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  صّوع, (K,) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(O,) said of an ass, [meaning a wild ass,] He<br>\
drove his she asses to the right and left: (O, K:)<br>\
so expl. by Ibn-&#39;Abbád. (O.) And, said of a<br>\
horse, He went at random, and resisted his owner<br>\
[or rider]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  صوّع إِلَيْهِ [said of a man, as<br>\
is indicated in the O,] He turned about his head<br>\
towards him: and he turned his face towards him.<br>\
(O, TA.) ―<br>\

5<br>\
تصوّع It became dispersed, or scattered; as<br>\
also ↓ انصاع. (S.) You say, تصوّع القَوْمُ The<br>\
people, or party, became dispersed, or scattered,<br>\
and remote, all of them, one from another. (O,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, said of hair, It became contracted,<br>\
and much split: [app. by reason of dryness: like<br>\
تصوّح:] (Lth, O, K:) or it became dispersed, or<br>\
scattered; (Lh, O, K;) and it fell off by degrees.<br>\
(O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, said of herbage, It became dried<br>\
up; (S, O, K;) like تصوّح; (O;) as also تصيّع.<br>\

7<br>\
انصاع: see 5. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  He turned away,<br>\

صيع, from the book entitled “ Ghareeb el-<br>\
Hamám ” by El-Hasan Ibn-&#39; Abd-Alláh El-Kátib<br>\
El-Isbahánee.)<br>\
صَاعٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and ↓ صُوعٌ and<br>\
↓ صَوْعٌ (O, K) and ↓ صُوَاعٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ صِوَاعٌ,<br>\
(O, K,) thus accord. to five different readers of<br>\
the Kur in xii. 72, (O, K, * TA,) A certain measure used for measuring corn (&amp; c.], (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) and upon which turn [or depend] the decisions of the Muslims [relating to measures of<br>\
capacity]: (K:) or the صاع is different from the<br>\
↓ صُوَاع; (S, K;) the latter being a certain vessel,<br>\
in [or from] which one drinks [as will be expl.<br>\
hereafter in this paragraph]: (S, TA:) the former<br>\
is four أَمْدَاد [pl. of مُدٌّ]; (S, O, Msb, K;) i. e.<br>\
(Msb) five أَرْطَال [or pints] and a third, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA,) by the measure of Baghdád; (Msb;)<br>\
the مُدّ being a pint and a third: (K, TA:) so<br>\
with the people of El-Hijáz, (Mgh, TA,) [i. e.]<br>\
so with the people of the Harameyn, as was<br>\
proved by a number of specimens of the صاع<br>\
used in dealings with the Prophet, (Msb,) and<br>\
so accord. to Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee: (TA:) but with the<br>\
people of El-&#39; Irák it was eight pints, (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA,) with whom agreed Aboo-Haneefeh; the<br>\
مُدّ with them being two pints; (Msb, TA;) but<br>\
the addition was made by El-Hajjáj; and their<br>\
صاع was the قَفِيز حَجَّاجِىّ, and was unknown to<br>\
the people of El-Medeeneh, as is said by Az:<br>\
(Msb:) accord. to Ed-Dáwoodee, its invariable<br>\
measure is four times the quantity [of corn &amp; c.]<br>\
that fills the two hands, that are neither large nor<br>\
small, of a man; for the صاع of the Prophet is<br>\
not found in every place; and this (the author of<br>\
the K says, TA) I have tried, and found to be<br>\
correct: (K, TA:) the word is masc. and fem.:<br>\
(Zj, Msb, K, TA:) accord. to Fr, the people of<br>\
El-Hijáz make it fem.; and Benoo-Asad, except<br>\
some of them, make it masc., as do the people of<br>\
Nejd; and Zj says that the more chaste way is to<br>\
make it masc.: (Msb:) the pl. (of pauc., used<br>\
by those who make the sing. fem., O, Msb) is<br>\
أَصْوُعٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) for which one may<br>\
say أَصْؤُعٌ, (S, O, K, *) changing the و into hemzeh, (S, O,) and accord. to AAF some say آصُعٌ,<br>\
like آدُرٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) a pl. of دَارٌ, (Mgh,) but<br>\
AHát says that this is a vulgar mistake, (Msb,)<br>\
and أَصْوَاعٌ, (O, Msb, K,) which is used by those<br>\
who make the sing. masc., (O, Msb,) and [of<br>\
mult.] صُوعٌ, (K,) which is app. pl. of ↓ صِوَاعٌ,<br>\
with kesr, (TA,) and صِيعَانٌ, (Mgh, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
which is [likewise] a pl. of mult., (Msb,) or this<br>\
last is pl. of ↓ صُوَاعٌ: and this sing. signifies a<br>\
[vessel of the kind called] جَام, [app. here used in<br>\
the sense which this word commonly has in Pers.,<br>\
i. e. as meaning a cup,] in which, (K, TA,) or<br>\
from which, (TA,) one drinks: (K, TA:) Sa&#39;eed<br>\
Ibn-Jubeyr says that the صواع of the king [mentioned in the Kur xii. 72] was the Persian مَكُّوك,<br>\
of which the two extremities [are compressed so<br>\
that they] meet together [app. in such a manner<br>\
that the whole vessel resembles a small boat, the<br>\
word مكّوك being expl. in several dictionaries as<br>\
applied to a drinking-vessel of this form, probably<br>\
from the Pers. مَكُّوكْ signifying “ a shuttle ” and<br>\
used in this sense in modern Arabic]: El-Hasan<br>\
says that the صُوَاع and the سِقَايَة are one thing, as<br>\
Zj also says; and that the صواع of the king is said<br>\
to have been of وَرِق [meaning silver], and that<br>\
they used to measure with it and sometimes they<br>\
drank with it: Zj says that it is explained as an<br>\
oblong vessel, resembling the مَكُّوك, with which<br>\
the king used to drink; and said by some to have<br>\
been of مِسّ [which (as is said in the TA in art.<br>\
مس) means copper, from the Pers. مِسْ]. (TA.)<br>\
[See also صَوْغٌ, with غ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  صَاعٌ signifies also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The place [or plot] in which a صاع [of seed] is<br>\
sown: so in a trad. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A depressed<br>\
piece of ground; (S, O, K, TA;) as also ↓ صَاعَةٌ;<br>\
(O, K, TA;) like an excavation: or, as some say,<br>\
a depressed place, sloping down from its surrounding borders: (TA:) or a narrow, depressed place.<br>\
(TA in art. طأ.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A place that is swept<br>\
and in which one then plays: (Ibn-&#39; Abbád, O,<br>\
K:) [see the verse cited in what follows:] and<br>\
↓ صَاعَةٌ is said to signify a piece of ground which<br>\
a boy sweeps, removing its pebbles, and in which<br>\
he plays with the ball: and a bare place, in which<br>\
is nothing. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And The place of the breast<br>\
of the ostrich when she puts it upon the ground:<br>\
(K:) or such a place is called صَاعُ جُؤْجُؤِ النَّعَامِ.<br>\
(IF, O.) And one says, ضَرَبَهُ فِى صَاعِ جُؤُجُؤِهِ<br>\
and فى صاعِ صَدْرِهِ meaning (tropical:)  He struck him in<br>\
the middle of his breast. (Z, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And it is<br>\
said that] صَاعٌ also signifies The [kind of goffstick called] صَوْلَجَان. (K.) In the following<br>\
verse of El-Museiyab Ibn-&#39; Alas, describing a she-camel,<br>\
مَرِحَتْ يَدَاهَا لِلنَّجَآءِ كَأَنَّمَا<br>\
تَكْرُو بِكَفَّىْ لَاعِبٍ فِى صَاعِ<br>\
[the most obvious meaning of which is, Her<br>\
fore legs moved briskly for the purpose of hastening, as though she were propelling a ball with the<br>\
hands of a player in a piece of ground cleared for<br>\
that exercise,] or, as some relate it, بِكَفَّىْ مَاقِطٍ,<br>\
meaning with the hands of a player with the<br>\
ball, it is said by some that he means بِصَاعٍ,<br>\
[though it is not easy to see why, if so, he did<br>\
not say بِالصَّاعِ,] and that by the صاع he means<br>\
the صَوْلَجَان, because it is bent (يُعْطَفُ [see 1, last<br>\
sentence,]) for the purpose of striking with it, that<br>\
the ball may be propelled (تُصَاعُ) with it. (O.)<br>\
صَوْعٌ and صُوعٌ: see صَاعٌ, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  The<br>\
latter is also a pl., (K, TA,) app. of صِوَاعٌ, with<br>\
kesr. (TA.)<br>\
صُوَعٌ Portions of herbage beginning to dry up.<br>\
(Ibn-&#39; Abbád, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And of the flesh of a<br>\
horse, Such as is scattered, or sparse; not collected together in one place. (Ibn-&#39; Abbád, O.)<br>\
صَاعَةٌ: see صَاعٌ, latter half, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also (tropical:)  A place prepared by a woman for the<br>\
separating and loosening of cotton: (Lth, O, K,<br>\
TA:) and (assumed tropical:)  a skin, like a نِطْع, which a woman<br>\
sometimes makes, or prepares, for the separating<br>\
and loosening of cotton and of wool upon it.<br>\
(ISh, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A place specially made,<br>\
or prepared, for guests. (Z, TA.)<br>\
صُوَاعٌ and صِوَاعٌ: see صَاعٌ, former half, in five<br>\
places.<br>\
أُصَيَّاعٌ occurs as a dim. of صِيعَانٌ [or rather of<br>\
أَصْوَاعٌ, pl. of صَاعٌ, regularly formed therefrom].<br>\
(IB, TA.)<br>\
مُنْصَاعٌ [part. n. of 7] Turning away or back,<br>\
retreating, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
