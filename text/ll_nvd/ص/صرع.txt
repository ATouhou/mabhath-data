مَثَلُ المُؤْمِنِ كَالخَامَةِ مِنَ الزَّرْعِ تَصْرَعُهَا الرِّيحُ<br>\

to the Ra-ees [Ibn-Seenà, whom we call “ Avicenna ”], (TA,) preventing, but not completely,<br>\
the vital organs from performing their actions<br>\
[or functions]; the cause of which is an obstruction that occurs in one or more of the venters<br>\
(بُطُون) of the brain and in the ducts of the<br>\
أَعْصَاب [here meaning nerves] by which the<br>\
members are moved, [arising] from an abundant<br>\
thick or viscous خِلْط [or humour], whereby the<br>\
رُوح [by which is here meant, as in many other<br>\
instances, the vital spirit, or nervous fluid,] is<br>\
prevented from pervading them in the natural<br>\
manner, and consequently the members become<br>\
[spasmodically] contracted. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A<br>\
sort, or species: and a state, condition, or manner<br>\
of being: syn. ضَرْبٌ and فَنٌّ: (S, K:) of a thing:<br>\

chosen]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also صِرْعٌ, in three places.<br>\
―<br>\

water when the other returns from it, by reason<br>\
of their [the camels&#39;] multitude. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And [hence, perhaps,] الصَّرْعَانِ signifies The<br>\
night and the day; (K;) [and] so ↓ الصِّرْعَانِ,<br>\
with kesr, like الصِّرْفَانِ: (TA in art. صرف:) or<br>\
the forenoon and the afternoon; from the first<br>\
part of day to midday and from midday to sunset; each of these being termed صَرْعٌ: (S, O, K:)<br>\
or the morning, between daybreak and sunrise,<br>\
and the evening, between sunset and nightfall; as<br>\
also العَصْرَانِ; (S and K in explanation of الأَبْرَدَانِ;)<br>\
and some assert that it is formed by transposition<br>\

the day. (A, TA.) And one says, أَتَيْتُهُ صَرْعَىِ<br>\
النَّهَارِ I came to him in the morning and evening;<br>\
or between daybreak and sunrise and between<br>\
sunset and nightfall. (S, O, K.) And لَقِيتُهُ صَرْعَىِ<br>\
النَّهَارِ I met him at the two extremities of the day.<br>\
(A, TA.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says,<br>\
كَأَنَّنِى نَازِعٌ يَثْنِيهِ عَنْ وَطَنٍ<br>\
صَرْعَانِ رَائِحَةً عَقْلٌ وَتَقْيِيدُ<br>\
meaning As though I were one, i. e. a camel,<br>\
yearning towards his place of abode, which an<br>\
evening and a morning, in evening a binding of<br>\
the fore shank to the arm and in the morning<br>\

from a settled abiding-place: or, as Aboo-&#39;Alee<br>\
relates it, رَائِحَةٌ, [as a partial substitute for<br>\
صَرْعَانِ,] meaning, an evening, when there is a<br>\
binding of the fore shank to the arm, and a<br>\
morning, when there is a shackling of the legs;<br>\
for they bind the camel&#39;s fore shank to his arm<br>\
in the evening when he is lying down, and they<br>\
shackle his legs in the morning so that he may<br>\
pasture [but not stray]: another reading is صَرْعَاهُ<br>\
[his morning and evening]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  One says<br>\
also, هُوَ صَرْعُ كَذَا i. e. حِذَآءَهُ [app. meaning It<br>\

أَىِّ صِرْعَىْ أَمْرِهِ هُوَ [I sought, or demanded, of<br>\
such a one, an object of want, and then turned<br>\
away, and I know not in which of the two opposite conditions he was in respect of his affair, or<br>\
case]; i. e., his affair, or case, did not become<br>\
apparent, or clear, or known, to me. (S, O, K. *)<br>\
And a poet says,<br>\
فَرُحْتُ وَمَا وَدَّعْتُ لَيْلَى وَمَا دَرَتْ<br>\
عَلَى أَىِّ صِرْعَىْ أَمْرِهَا أَتَرَوَّحُ<br>\
[And I went, and bade not farewell to Leylà,<br>\
and she knew not in which of the two opposite<br>\
conditions in respect of her affair, or case, I was<br>\
going]; i. e., whether I went from her presence<br>\
retaining attachment, or forsaking; (S, TA;) or,<br>\
as Z says, in a condition of success or of disappointment. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also صَرْعٌ, in the middle<br>\
of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A like; a similar<br>\

says, هُمَا صِرْعَانِ (S, O) and ↓ صَرْعَانِ (O) They<br>\
two are likes: (S, O:) and so شِرْعَانِ, &amp;c. (S.)<br>\
And هٰذَا صِرْعُهُ and ↓ صَرْعُهُ This is the like of him,<br>\
or it: and so ضِرْعُهُ and ضَرْعُهُ, &amp;c. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And A strand of a rope: (O, K:) and so<br>\
ضِرْعٌ: (O:) pl. صُرُوعٌ (O, K) and ضُرُوعٌ. (O.)<br>\
صَرْعَةٌ A single act of throwing down, or prostrating, on the ground; or a single suffering of<br>\
prostration. (K, TA.) See also صِرْعَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
A state, or condition: (O, K:) so in the saying,<br>\
هُوَ يَفْعَلُهُ فِى كُلِّ صِرْعَةٍ [He does it in every<br>\
state, or condition]: (O:) [see also صَرْعٌ:] or,<br>\
accord. to the “ Mufradát ” [of Er-Rághib], the<br>\
state, or condition, of him who is thrown down,<br>\
or prostrated. (TA.)<br>\
صُرْعَةٌ One who is often thrown down, or prostrated, by men. (K.)<br>\
صِرْعَةٌ A mode, or manner, of throwing down,<br>\
or prostrating; or of being thrown down, or<br>\
prostrated: (S, * K, TA:) a word similar to رِكْبَةٌ<br>\
and جِلْسَةٌ. (S.) Hence, (K,) one says, سُوْءُ<br>\
الاِسْتِمْسَاكِ خَيْرٌ مِنْ حُسْنِ الصِّرْعَةِ [The bad manner<br>\
of holding fast upon one&#39;s beast is better than the<br>\
good manner of being thrown down, or prostrated]: (S, K:) i. e., when one holds fast, though<br>\
he ride not well, it is better than one&#39;s being<br>\
thrown down, or prostrated, in a manner that<br>\
does not hurt him; because he who holds fast<br>\
sometimes overtakes, but he who is thrown down<br>\
will not attain: (TA:) a prov.: or, as some relate<br>\
it, ↓ حُسْنِ الصَّرْعَةِ, which means the good manner<br>\
of the single suffering of prostration. (K, * TA.<br>\
[See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 623.])<br>\

teshdeed, mentioned by Ks: (O:) or ↓ صِرِّيعٌ<br>\
signifies one who throws down, or prostrates,<br>\
vehemently, though he be not well known for doing<br>\
so; as also ↓ صَرَّاعٌ and ↓ صَرِيعٌ, the latter like أَمِيرٌ<br>\
[in measure, but this I think doubtful, probably<br>\
added from finding صِرِّيعٌ mistranscribed]: or<br>\
↓ صِرِّيعٌ, accord. to the T, one whose occupation,<br>\
whereby he is known, is the throwing down, or<br>\
prostrating, others [as a wrestler]. (TA.) It is<br>\
said in a trad. that the Prophet asked, Whom do<br>\
ye reckon the صُرَعَة among you? they said,<br>\
Him whom men will not throw down: and he<br>\
said, He is not such, but is (assumed tropical:)  he who governs<br>\
himself on the occasion of anger: or, as some<br>\
relate it, (assumed tropical:)  the forbearing on the occasion of anger,<br>\
(O, TA. *)<br>\

fallen to the ground: (Msb:) and [in like manner] one says ↓ غُصْنٌ مَصْرُوعٌ; and مَصَارِعُ is said<br>\
to occur in a verse of Lebeed as pl. of the latter<br>\
word, the reg. pl. of which is مَصَارِيعُ: but in that<br>\
verse some read ↓ مُصَرَّع [which has a similar<br>\
meaning. (TA. [See EM p. 157.]) ―<br>\
-b6-  صَرِيعٌ<br>\
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  Slain: from the same word as<br>\
applied to a branch and expl. above: pl. صَرْعَى.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And (tropical:)  A twig, or rod, drooping, or<br>\
hanging down, to the ground, falling upon it,<br>\
but with its base upon the tree, so that it remains<br>\
falling in the shade, the sun not reaching it, and<br>\
therefore becomes more soft, or supple, than the<br>\
branch [from which it depends], and more sweet<br>\
in odour; and it is used for rubbing and cleaning<br>\
the teeth [i. e. مَسَاوِيك are made of it]: pl. صُرُعٌ:<br>\
(K, TA: [the pl. is thus in the L; but in some<br>\
copies of the K صُرْعٌ:]) or, accord. to the T, the<br>\
sing. signifies a twig, or rod, that falls from the<br>\
tree called بَشَام [q. v.]; and the pl. is صُرْعَانٌ: the<br>\
former pl. occurs in a trad., in which it is said<br>\

teeth with صُرُع. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Also (tropical:)  A bow from<br>\

doors that are set up, meeting together, the place<br>\
of entrance thereof being in the middle of them<br>\

سجف) means the two separate halves, that hang<br>\
side by side, so as to meet together, of a curtain;<br>\

↓ مِصْرَع: (TA:) the pl. of مِصْرَاعٌ is مَصَارِيعُ.<br>\
(MA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, the مِصْرَاع in poetry; (S;)<br>\
A hemistich: (MA, KL:) [this is the general<br>\
meaning: in a more restricted sense,] مِصْرَاعَانِ in<br>\

[using it in the latter sense, i. e. as meaning a<br>\

Aboo-Is-hák says, the مِصْرَاعَانِ are the two doors<br>\
of the ode, like the مصراعان of the house, or<br>\
