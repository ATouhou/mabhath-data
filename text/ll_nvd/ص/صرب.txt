صَرَبَ He made the sour milk termed صَرْب:<br>\
(K, * TA:) [or] صَرَبَ اللَّبَنَ, (M, TA,) aor.<br>\
صَرِبَ,<br>\
(M,) or<br>\
صَرُبَ, (TA,) inf. n. صَرْبٌ, he made the<br>\
milk to become what is termed صَرْب: and he<br>\
milked some of the milk upon other milk, and left<br>\
it to become sour: (M, TA:) or صَرَبَ اللَّبَنَ فِى<br>\
الوَطْبِ he collected the milk in the skin, portion<br>\
after portion, and left it to become sour; as also<br>\
↓ اِصْطَرَبَهُ: (S:) or you say, صَرَبَ اللَّبَنَ فِى السِّقَآءِ<br>\
and السَّمْنَ فِى النِّحْىِ [he collected, portion after<br>\
portion, and left, the milk in the skin called سِقَآء<br>\
and the clarified butter in the skin called نِحْى].<br>\
(M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] صَرَبْتُ اللَّبَنَ فِى الضَّرْعِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I caused the milk to collect in the udder, not<br>\
drawing it forth. (Kt, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And صَرَبَ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
kept in, or retained, and collected, [his] urine:<br>\
(K, TA:) or withheld it long: and accord. to<br>\
some, particularly said of a stallion-camel: (TA:)<br>\
[or] صَرَبَ بَوْلَهُ, (S, M,) aor.<br>\
صَرُبَ and<br>\
صَرِبَ, inf. n. صَرْبٌ,<br>\
(M,) (assumed tropical:)  he kept in, or retained, and collected, his<br>\
urine: (S, M:) accord. to some, particularly said<br>\
of a stallion-camel. (M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And صَرَبَ الصَّبِىُّ<br>\
[ذَا بَطْنِهِ being app. understood] (assumed tropical:)  The boy remained some days without discharging his excrement, or ordure: (M, TA:) and صَرَبَ بَطْنُ الصَّبِىِّ,<br>\
inf. n. صَرْبٌ, (assumed tropical:)  the boy&#39;s belly became constipated<br>\
(عَقَدَ), that he might become fat: (M:) [or]<br>\
صَرَبَ الصَّبِىُّ لِيَسْمَنَ (assumed tropical:)  the boy&#39;s excrement, or ordure, (ذُو بَطْنِهِ,) became confined, so that he<br>\
remained a day without discharging it, when he<br>\
was about to become fat. (S.) [In the copies of<br>\
the K, صَرَبَ is expl. as signifying عَقَدَ بَطْنَ<br>\
الصَّبِىِّ لِيَسْمَنَ, to which, written without the syll.<br>\
signs, the TA assigns the last of the meanings<br>\
above; therefore, I doubt not, the right reading is<br>\
بَطْنُ, agreeably with the explanation of صَرَبَ<br>\
بَطْنُ الصَّبِىِّ in the M, given above: otherwise, the<br>\
meaning must be (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, caused the boy&#39;s<br>\
belly to become bound, or constipated, that he<br>\
might become fat.]<br>\
-A2-  صَرِبَ, aor.<br>\
صَرَبَ, (K, TA,)<br>\

صَرَبَتِ الأَرْضُ The land produced herbs, or trees,<br>\
such as are termed صَرَب [a coll. gen. n. of which<br>\
the n. un. is صَرَبَةٌ, q. v.]. (M, K. * [The meaning<br>\
is indicated in both by the context.])<br>\
-A4-  صَرَبَ<br>\
also signifies He cut, or cut off; (K, TA;) i. q.<br>\
صَرَمَ; like as one says ضَرْبَةَ لَازِبٍ and لَازِمٍ. (TA.)<br>\
-A5-  And i. q. كَسَبَ [He gained, acquired, or<br>\
earned; &amp;c.]. (K.)<br>\

صَرْب. (TA.)<br>\

↓ اِصْرَأَبَّ] It was, or became, smooth, (M, O, K,<br>\

Q. Q. 4<br>\
اِصْرَأَبَّ: see what next precedes.<br>\
صَرْبٌ and ↓ صَرَبٌ (S, M, &amp;c.) Sour milk (M,<br>\
Mgh, K) that has been collected in a skin: (M,<br>\
K:) or very sour milk: (S, Msb:) or milk that<br>\
has been collected in a skin for some days so that<br>\
it has become very sour: (As, M:) n. un. ↓ صَرْبَةٌ<br>\
and ↓ صَرَبَةٌ: (M, TA:) صِرَابٌ, occurring in some<br>\
of the Expositions of the Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer, is a<br>\
mistranscription; or it may be a pl. of صَرْبٌ<br>\
accord. to the analogy of حَبْلٌ and حِبَالٌ, and رَمْلٌ<br>\
and رِمَالٌ. (Mgh.) One says, تَزْوِى ↓ جَآءَنَا بَصَرْبَةٍ<br>\
الوَجْهَ [He brought us some sour milk, or very sour<br>\
milk, that had been collected in a skin, making<br>\
the face to contract in wrinkles]. (S.) [SM here<br>\
adds,] Az says that الصَّرْمُ is like الصَّرْبُ, and is<br>\
better known. (TA. [But this evidently relates<br>\
to the signification of “ the act of cutting,” or<br>\
“ cutting off; ” not to الصَّرْبُ as applied to milk.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K,) or the former word, (M,) Milk<br>\
that is provided in a skin for a journey, (M, K,)<br>\
whether fresh or sour. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And both words,<br>\
(M, K, TA,) or ↓ صَرَبٌ [only], (S, Msb,) Gum:<br>\
(Msb:) or red gum: (T, S, M, L, TA: in the K,<br>\
الصِّبْغُ الأَحْمَرُ is erroneously put for الصَّمْغُ<br>\
الأَحْمَرُ: TA:) some say (M) it is the gum of the<br>\
طَلْح (S, M) and of the عُرْفُط, peculiarly; the<br>\
pieces of which are red, as though they were ingots<br>\
[of gold], and they are broken with stones: (M:)<br>\
the n. un. is ↓ صَرَبَةٌ: (S, M: [صَرْبَةٌ as a n. un. in<br>\
this sense I do not find mentioned:]) and sometimes it [i. e. صَرْبٌ or صَرَبٌ] has صِرَابٌ for pl.:<br>\
(M:) sometimes, (S,) what is called ↓ صَرَبَةٌ is a<br>\
thing like the head of the cat [in size], within<br>\
which is a thing [or substance] like دِبْس [or honey<br>\
of dates], (S, K,) and like glue, (S,) which is<br>\
sucked and eaten. (S, K.)<br>\
صِرْبٌ A few tents (بُيُوت [in the O, erroneously,<br>\
بُتُوت]) of the weak sort of the Arabs of the desert:<br>\
(IAar, O, * K, TA:) and so صِرْمٌ. (O.)<br>\
صَرَبٌ: see صَرْبٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Red<br>\
honey. (TA in art. ضرب.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also صَرَبَةٌ.<br>\
صَرْبَةٌ: see صَرْبٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
(tropical:)  The water [by which is meant the seminal fluid]<br>\
that collects in the back [of a man]; as being<br>\
likened to the [sour] milk that is collected in a<br>\
skin. (M, TA.)<br>\
صَرَبَةٌ: see صَرْبٌ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
herb, (M, K,) and tree, (M,) that becomes green,<br>\
and puts forth leaves, when dry, or that has<br>\
grown, or become somewhat restored to a good<br>\
state, after having been eaten [or depastured],<br>\
(يَتَجَبَّرُ, so in the M, [in the K يَتَخَيَّرُ, which, as<br>\
is remarked in the TK, is a mistake,]) after men<br>\
[have fed their cattle therefrom]: pl. [or rather<br>\
coll. gen. n.] ↓ صَرَبٌ. (M.)<br>\
صَرْبَى, (S, K,) accord. to Sa&#39;eed Ibn-El-Museiyib, (TA,) The [she-camel called] بَحِيرَة, (S,<br>\
K,) whose milk was forbidden [by the pagan<br>\
Arabs] for the sake of the idols (الطَّوَاغِيت), no<br>\
man milking her [for himself]: (TA:) thus<br>\
called, (S, K, TA,) it is said, (TA,) because they<br>\
used not to milk her save for the guest, so that<br>\
her milk became collected [and retained] (S, K,<br>\
TA) in her udder: (S, TA:) Kt says, it is from<br>\
صَرَبْتُ اللَّبَنَ فِى الضَّرْعِ [expl. above]; or, as some<br>\
say, from [الصَّرْبُ as signifying] “ the act of cutting,” or “ cutting off; ” and this seems to be the<br>\
more correct of the two explanations: accord. to<br>\
IAar, it signifies a she-camel having the ear slit,<br>\
like the بَحِيرَة, or cut off: and its pl., he says, is<br>\
صُرْبٌ. (TA.)<br>\
صِرَابٌ See-produce, or corn, which has been<br>\
sown after that which has been carried off to the<br>\
place where it is trodden in the autumn. (O, K.)<br>\
صَرِيبٌ Milk that has been made what is termed<br>\
صَرْب; as also ↓ مَصْرُوبٌ: (M, TA:) or sour milk:<br>\
(A, K, TA:) pl. صُرْبٌ. (K.) So in the saying<br>\
الضَّرِيبَ لَا الصَّرِيبَ, i. e. [Give me] the thick [milk],<br>\
from a number of milch camels, that has been<br>\
mixed together; not the sour. (A, TA.)<br>\
صَرَابَةٌ Clearness, and smoothness: thus in the<br>\
phrase صَرَابَةُ حَنْظَلٍ in a verse of Imra-el-Keys;<br>\
as some relate it: (M, TA:) as others relate it,<br>\
صَرَايَة, (M,) or صَلَايَة. (TA.)<br>\
مِصْرَبٌ A vessel in which milk is collected,<br>\
portion after portion, and left to become sour:<br>\
(S, K: *) and so مِكْرَصٌ and مِقْرَعٌ: pl. مَصَارِبُ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَصْرُوبٌ: see صَرِيبٌ.<br>\
مُصَرَّبَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A she-camel that is kept from being<br>\
milked, in order that she may become fat. (L in<br>\
art. صفح, from the T.)<br>\
