صَدَّ عَنْهُ, (S, M, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
صَدُ3َ (S, M, A)<br>\
and<br>\
صَدِ3َ, (M,) the latter only agreeable with<br>\
analogy, (MF,) [but the former, which is the<br>\
more common, explainable on the ground that<br>\
وَجْهَهُ or the like is understood,] inf. n. صُدُودٌ (S,<br>\
M, A, K) and صَدٌّ, (M,) He turned away from,<br>\
avoided, shunned, and left, him, or it; he was<br>\
averse from him, or it; (S, M, A, Msb, K;) he<br>\
turned away his face from him [or it]: (Ham<br>\
p. 89:) and صَدَّهُ also, aor.<br>\
صَدُ3َ, inf. n. صَدٌّ, he<br>\
forsook him, and turned away his face from him.<br>\
(L.) One says, أَرَى فِيكَ صُدُودًا [I see in thee<br>\
aversion]. (A.) And لَا صَدَّ عَنْ ذَاكَ [lit. There<br>\
is no evading that], meaning truly thou didst<br>\
that. (Lh, M.) صَدَّ السَّبِيلُ (tropical:)  [The road, or way,<br>\
turned aside] is said when a difficult road up a<br>\
mountain, (A, L,) or some other obstacle, (A,)<br>\
presents itself before thee, and thou leavest it,<br>\
and takest another way. (A, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And صَدَّهُ<br>\
عَنْهُ, (S, M, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
صَدُ3َ, (Msb,) inf. n. صَدٌّ;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) and ↓ اصدّهُ, (S, M, K,) inf. n.<br>\
إِصْدَادٌ; (TA;) and ↓ صدّدهُ; (M;) He averted<br>\
him; turned him, or sent him, away, or back; or<br>\
caused him to return, or go back, or revert; from<br>\
it: (S, M, Msb, K:) prevented, or hindered, him<br>\
from doing it: (S, A, Msb, K:) or did so by<br>\
gentle means: and so ضَدَّهُ. (L in art. ضد.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
صَدَّ, aor.<br>\
صَدِ3َ, (T, S, M, A, K,) agreeably with<br>\
analogy, (MF,) and this is the more approved<br>\
form, (T,) and<br>\
صَدُ3َ, (T, S, K,) inf. n. صَدِيدٌ (S, A,<br>\
K) and صَدٌّ, (M,) He cried out, vociferated, or<br>\
raised a clamour, (T, S, M, A, K,) مِنْ كَذَا [at,<br>\

صدّدهُ عَنْهُ: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  And صدّد, (T, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. تَصْدِيدٌ; for which one says صدّد, inf. n.<br>\
تَصْدِيَةٌ, (T, M, * K, * TA,) changing one of the<br>\
دs into ى, (T, K, TA,) like as one says قَصَّيْتُ<br>\
أَظْفَارِى, which is originally قَصَّصْتُ; (T, TA;)<br>\
and صَدَّى بِيَدَيْهِ; (TA in art. صدى;) He<br>\
clapped with his hands; (T, M, K;) because, in<br>\
the action of clapping the hands together, the<br>\
صَدّ, i. e. “ face,” of one hand fronts that of the<br>\
other; or, accord. to Aboo-Jaafar Er-Rustamee,<br>\
التَّصْدِيَةُ is from صَدًى meaning “ a sound ” [or<br>\
“ an echo ”]; but the former derivation is the<br>\
more probable: (TA:) [see art. صدى:] also he<br>\
raised his voice, or called out, or cried out. (M,<br>\
TA.) It is said in the Kur [viii. 35], وَمَا كَانَ<br>\
صَلَاتُهُمْ عِنَدْ الْبَيْتِ إِلَّا مُكَآءً وَتَصْدِيَةً And their<br>\
prayer at the House [of God] is nought but<br>\
whistling, and clapping with the hands: (M, *<br>\
TA:) meaning, they do thus instead of praying as<br>\
they have been commanded to do. (Jel.)<br>\
-A3-  See<br>\
also 4.<br>\
3<br>\

↓ صدّد; (M, TA;) It contained, or generated,<br>\
matter, (S, M, Msb, K,) such as is termed صَدِيد:<br>\
(M, Msb:) or ran with such matter. (A.)<br>\
5<br>\
تصدّد لَهُ, for which one says تَصَدَّى له,<br>\
[changing the last د into ى, as in the case of<br>\
صَدَّدَ, q. v.,] from الصَّدَدُ, meaning “ the place, or<br>\
part, that is before, in front, facing, or opposite; ”<br>\
(Az, L;) He addressed, or applied, or directed,<br>\
himself, or his regard, or attention, or mind, to<br>\
him, or it; [as though he set himself over against<br>\
the object to which the verb relates:] and he<br>\
asked him, or petitioned him, for a thing that he<br>\
wanted: syn. تَعَرَّضَ لَهُ; (L and K * in the present<br>\
art., and S and M and K in art. صدى;) and<br>\
أَقْبَلَ عَلَيْهِ; (L;) and تَضَرَّعَ لَهُ: (M in art. صدى:)<br>\
he inclined to him, or it: (L:) he raised his head<br>\
towards it: (M in art. صدى, in explanation of<br>\
تصدّى:) he raised his head and breast towards<br>\
it, looking towards it, or regarding it: (TA in<br>\
art. صدى, in explanation of تصدّى:) the object<br>\
is one at which you raise your eyes, looking at<br>\
it: (S in art. صدى, in explanation of تصدّى:)<br>\
he applied, or gave, his whole attention to it,<br>\
(meaning an affair,) having his mind unoccupied<br>\
by other things; syn. تَفَرَّغَ لَهُ وَتَبَتَّلَ. (Msb.)<br>\
One says also, تصدّى لِلرَّدِّ عَلَى المُصَنِّفِ [He<br>\
addressed, or applied, himself to reply against the<br>\
author]. (TA in art. حزب, &amp;c.) And تصدّى<br>\
لِلْمَعْرُوفِ وَطَلَبَهُ He addressed himself, or applied<br>\
himself, to obtain favour, or bounty; and sought<br>\
it; syn. تَعَرَّضَ لَهُ [and تَبَرَّى له]. (Msb in art.<br>\
عرض.) And أَنْتَ لَهُ تَصَدَّى, [in the Kur, lxxx., 6,]<br>\
originally تَتَصَدَّدُ, (L,) and accord. to one reading<br>\
تَصَّدَّى, (Jel,) means To him thou addressest<br>\
thyself, or directest thine attention, and inclinest;<br>\
syn. تَتَعَرَّضُ لَهُ, (L,) and تُقْبِلُ عَلَيْهِ, (Zj,) and<br>\
تَمِيلُ إِلَيْهِ; (L;) or تَتَعَرَّضُ لَهُ بِالْإِقْبَالِ عَلَيْهِ: (Bd:)<br>\
or addressest thyself, &amp;c., and humblest thyself:<br>\
(M in art. صدى: [in which, however, this explanation is not given with express reference to<br>\
the above-cited phrase in the Kur:]) or it may<br>\
signify thou seekest to bring thyself near to him,<br>\
or to advance thyself in his favour; from الصَّدَدُ<br>\
as signifying القُرْبُ. (T.) [See also art. صدى.]<br>\
