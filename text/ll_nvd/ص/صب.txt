تَصَبَّ3َ see 7, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  And see also what<br>\
here follows.<br>\
6<br>\
تَصَابَبْتُ المَآءَ I drank what remained of the<br>\
water (S, A, K) in a vessel: (S, A:) [or] you<br>\
say, تصابّ الصُّبَابَةَ and ↓ اصطبّها and ↓ تصبّبها [he<br>\
drank what remained of the water, or of the milk,<br>\
in a vessel]; (M, L;) all signifying the same.<br>\
(L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,] تَصَابَّ فُلَانٌ المَعِيشَةَ<br>\
بَعْدَ فُلانٍ [lit. Such a one drank the remains of<br>\
life after such a one], meaning (tropical:)  such a one<br>\

أَجْمَعِينَ إِلَّا وَاحِدًا (tropical:)  [I outlived them all except<br>\
one]. (TA.) Esh-Shemmákh says, (M,) or ElAkhtal, (TA,)<br>\
لَقَوْمٌ تَصَابَبْتُ المَعِيشَةَ بَعْدَهُمْ<br>\
أَعَزُّ عَلَىَّ مِنْ عِفَآءٍ تَغَيَّرَا<br>\
(tropical:)  [Verily the loss of a people whom I have outlived is more severe to me than abundant and long<br>\
hair that has become altered in colour]: he means,<br>\
the loss of those with whom I was in a state of<br>\
ease and plenty is more severe to me than my<br>\
hair&#39;s becoming white: (M:) Az says, he likens<br>\
what remained of his life to the remains of beverage that he was sipping up. (TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انصبّ It (water, S, M, and the like, M)<br>\
poured out or forth, or became poured out or<br>\
forth; (S, M, A, K;) as also ↓ صَبَّ, (M, Msb,<br>\
K,) aor.<br>\
صَبِ3َ, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. صَبِيبٌ; (Msb;)<br>\
and ↓ تصبّب, (M, K,) which is of a form rarely<br>\
occurring as that of a quasi-pass. of an unaugmented triliteral verb, being generally that of the<br>\
quasi-pass. of a verb of the form فَعَّلَ; (MF,<br>\
TA;) [but this app. denotes its doing so repeatedly;<br>\
and abundantly, like تَدَفَّقَ, q. v.;] and ↓ اصطبّ.<br>\
(K.) One says, المَآءُ يَنْصَبُّ مِنَ الجَبَلِ, (TA,)<br>\
and من الجبل ↓ يَتَصَبَّبُ, (S, TA,) The water<br>\
descends, little by little, from the mountain. (S,<br>\
TA.) And العَرَقُ ↓ تصبّب [The sweat flowed],<br>\
and الدَّمُ [the blood]. (A.) And عَرَقًا ↓ تَصَبَّبْتُ<br>\
[which may be rendered I flowed with sweat] is<br>\
a phrase of the Arabs, meaning تصبّب عَرَقِى [my<br>\
sweat flowed]: thus the act is literally ascribed to<br>\
the speaker, and what is essentially the agent<br>\
becomes a specificative: it is not allowable to say<br>\
عَرَقًا تَصَبَّبْتُ; for, as it is not allowable to put the<br>\
agent before the verb, so it is not allowable to put<br>\
the specificative, when it is virtually the agent,<br>\
before the verb. (IJ, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also,<br>\
انصبّ الكُوزُ [The mug had its contents poured out<br>\
or forth]. (TA in art. دفق.) ―<br>\

implies descent, but] means (assumed tropical:)  The people collected<br>\
together, or assembled, at the water. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
[And انصبّ is often said of a place, or the ground,<br>\
&amp;c., meaning (assumed tropical:)  It sloped downwards. ―<br>\
-b6-  Har<br>\
(p. 125) uses the phrase تَنْصَبُّ إِلَى اللَّهْوِ, meaning (as there expl.) (assumed tropical:)  Thou inclinest to diversion,<br>\
or sport..]<br>\
8<br>\
اصطبّ المَآءَ is expl. by Sb as signifying He<br>\
took for himself the water; agreeably with general<br>\
analogy: (M:) [but it is more properly rendered<br>\
he poured out for himself the water:] one says,<br>\
اِصْطَبَبْتُ لِنَفْسِى مَآءً مِنَ القِرْبَةِ لِأَشْرَبَهُ [I poured<br>\
out for myself water from the skin that I might<br>\
drink it]: and اِصْطَبَبْتُ لِنَفْسِى قَدَحًا [I poured<br>\
out for myself a cup]. (TA.) ―<br>\

-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  It (the<br>\
night, M, A, K, and the day, AZ, TA, and the<br>\
heat, A) passed, or went, away, (AZ, M, A, K,)<br>\
except a small portion, (AZ, M, TA,) or for the<br>\
most part. (A. K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  It (what was in a water-skin, or milk-skin,) became little in quantity.<br>\
(Fr, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  It (a company of men) became<br>\
dispersed, or scattered. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  He (a man)<br>\
was, or became, very bold, or daring, and very<br>\
adverse, or repugnant, (M, * K, * TA,) عَلَيْنَا<br>\
[against us]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, said of a day, It<br>\
was, or became, intensely hot. (M, K, * TA.)<br>\
صَبٌّ is an inf. n. [and is] used [as an epithet]<br>\
in the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ, or of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولٌ: (TA:) [thus it is used as an<br>\
epithet] applied to water, [meaning Pouring out<br>\
or forth, or poured out or forth,] like as are<br>\
سَكْبٌ and غَوْرٌ: (S, TA: [see also صَابٌّ and<br>\
صَبِيبٌ:]) and hence, in &#39;Alee&#39;s description of<br>\
Aboo-Bekr, when he died, كُنْتَ عَلَى الكَافِرِينَ<br>\
عَذَابًا صَبًّا (assumed tropical:)  [Thou wast, against, or upon, the<br>\
unbelievers, a punishment pouring forth, or<br>\
poured forth]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence, app.,] one<br>\
says, ضَرَبَهُ ضَرْبًا صَبًّا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He smote him<br>\
with the edge of the sword [as though with a<br>\
smiting pouring down, or poured down]; as also<br>\
حَدْرً. (IAar, L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  One says also, ضَرَبَهُ<br>\
مِائِةً فَصَبًّا, (TA,) or أَخَذَ مِائَةً فَصَبًّا, (A,) meaning,<br>\
(tropical:)  [He smote him with a hundred blows, or he took<br>\
a hundred,] and less than that, i. e. فَدُونَ ذٰلِكَ,<br>\
(TA,) contr. of فَصَاعِدًا; (A;) or and more [than<br>\
that], or above [that], i. e. like فَصَاعِدًا, (A, TA,)<br>\
i. e. مَا فَوْقَ ذٰلِكَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَلَيْهِ البَلَآءُ ↓ صُبَّ,<br>\
مِنْ صَبٍّ, meaning (tropical:)  [Trial, or affliction, was<br>\
poured upon him] from above. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also,<br>\
applied to a man, Affected with excessive love, or<br>\
with attachment, or admiring love, (IAar, S, A, *<br>\
TA,) and desire: (S:) or with desire: (M, A, *<br>\
K:) or with tenderness of desire, (S, * M, A, * K,)<br>\
and ardour thereof: (S: * [see صَبَّ:]) or with<br>\
tenderness of love. (M, K.) One says, هُوَ صَبٌّ بِهَا<br>\
(and إِلَيْهَا (see صَبَّ)] He is affected with excessive<br>\
love of her; &amp;c.: (A:) fem. صَبَّةٌ: (M, K:) dual<br>\
masc. صَبَّانِ, pl. masc. صَبُّونَ; dual. fem. صَبَّتَانِ,<br>\
pl. fem. صَبَّاتٌ: thus accord. to those who hold<br>\
رَجُلٌ صَبٌّ to be similar to رَجُلٌ فَهِمٌ and حَذِرٌ,<br>\
originally صَبِبٌ: (TA:) [hence it appears that<br>\
some hold صَبٌّ to be originally an inf. n., and<br>\
therefore use it as an epithet in its original form,<br>\
without regard to gender or number: but] accord.<br>\
to Sb, صَبٌّ is [originally] of the measure فَعِلٌ,<br>\
because you say صَبِبْتُ صَبَابَةً, like as you say<br>\
قَنِعْتُ قَنَاعَةً. (M.) See also 1, last sentence.<br>\
صُبٌّ: see صُبَّةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to AO, it may also<br>\
be pl. of ↓ صَبُوبٌ or of ↓ صَابٌّ: but Az says that,<br>\
accord. to others, it is not pl. of either of these<br>\
two words; their pl. being صُبُبٌ: (L, TA:) it is<br>\
said in a trad., (S, L, TA,) respecting conflicts and<br>\
factions, or seditions, (L, TA,) لَتَعُودُنَّ فِيهَا أَسَاوِدَ<br>\
صُبًّا يَضْرِبُ بَعْضُكُمْ رِقَابَ بَعْضٍ: (S, L, TA:) here<br>\
by أَسَاوِد are meant “ [great and noxious] serpents: ” (L, TA:) and صُبًّا, accord. to Ez-Zuhree,<br>\
is from الصَّبُّ [“ the act of pouring out or forth ”];<br>\
for the serpent, he says, when it desires to bite,<br>\
raises itself, and then darts down (lit. pours down)<br>\
upon him that is bitten: (S, L, TA:) [as though<br>\
the meaning were, Ye will be, therein, like great<br>\
and noxious serpents, one portion of you smiting<br>\
the necks of another portion:] Ez-Zuhree says<br>\
that صُبًّا is pl. of ↓ صَبُوبٌ, and originally صُبُبًا;<br>\
like as رَجُلٌ صَبٌّ is originally صَبِبٌ; and so says<br>\
IAmb: but IAar is related to have said that<br>\
أَسَاوِد means companies, pl. of سَوَادٌ; and صُبًّا,<br>\
pouring, one upon another, with slaughter: and<br>\
some say that it is صُبَّى, in measure like حُبْلَى;<br>\
and it is said to be from صَبَا, [for صَبَا إِلَى الدُّنْيَا,]<br>\
aor. يَصْبُو, meaning “ he inclined to the things of<br>\
the present world; ” and thus to be like غُزَّى, pl.<br>\
of غَازٍ: [see صَابٍ, in art. صبو:] IAar used also<br>\
to say that it is originally صُبَّأً, with ء, [pl. of<br>\
صَابِئٌ,] from صَبَأً عَلَيْهِ “ he came, or came forth,<br>\
upon him unexpectedly. ” (L, TA.)<br>\
صُبَّةٌ A quantity of wheat or food, &amp;c., that is<br>\
poured out or forth (M, K) together, or collectedly; (M;) also (M, K) sometimes (M)<br>\
termed ↓ صُبٌّ. (M, K.) See also 1, near the beginning. ―<br>\
-b2-  And A سُفْرَة [or piece of skin in<br>\
which the traveller puts his food; or the thing<br>\
upon which one eats]; (M, K;) so called because<br>\
the food is poured into it, or upon it: (M:) or a<br>\
thing like the سُفْرَة: (M, K:) and صُنَّةٌ, with ن,<br>\
signifies the same. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also صُبَابَةٌ, with<br>\
which it is syn. ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A company of men:<br>\
(M, Msb, K:) [app. tropical; but it is said that]<br>\
this is the primary meaning, and it is used in<br>\
relation to camels, and sheep or goats, and the<br>\
like, tropically. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (tropical:)  A detached number<br>\
of horses, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) and of camels, (A,<br>\
K,) and of sheep or goats, (A, Msb, K,) and of<br>\
dirhems, or pieces of money: (A:) or from ten to<br>\
forty: (A, K:) or from twenty to thirty and<br>\
forty of camels and of sheep or goats: or less<br>\
than a hundred (M, A, K) of camels: (M, K:)<br>\
or of camels i. q. صِرْمَةٌ: (S:) and from ten to<br>\
forty of goats: (AZ, S:) or a flock of sheep or<br>\
a herd of goats, as being likened to a company of<br>\
men: (TA:) or from twenty to forty of sheep and<br>\
of goats; or peculiarly of goats: or about fifty:<br>\
or from sixty to seventy: and of camels about<br>\
five or six: (IAth, TA:) and a collection of<br>\
dirhems, or pieces of money, and of wheat, or<br>\
food, &amp;c.: and a piece of a thing: (Msb:) [or] a<br>\
small quantity or portion of wealth or property.<br>\

erroneously written تَصَبُّب, TA,) of a river, or<br>\
rivulet, or channel of water, or of a road, down a<br>\
declivity. (M, L, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A declivity,<br>\
declivous place, or ground sloping down; (M, A,<br>\
K, TA;) and (TA) so ↓ صَبِيبٌ, of which the pl.<br>\
is أَصْبَابٌ; (S, TA;) so too ↓ صَبُوبٌ and ↓ صُبُوبٌ,<br>\
with fet-h and with damm; (TA;) [i. e.] ↓ الصَّبُوبُ<br>\
signifies that down which you descend, or have<br>\
descended, (مَا انْصَبَبْتَ فِيهِ,) and its pl. is صُبُبٌ<br>\
[like عُمُدٌ pl. of عَمُودٌ]; (M, TA;) [and so<br>\
↓ الصُّبُوبُ;] or, as some say, ↓ الصَّبُوبُ, with fet-h,<br>\
is a name for the water, &amp;c., that is poured out upon<br>\
a man, like طَهُورٌ and غَسُولٌ; and ↓ صُبُوبٌ, with<br>\
damm, is pl. of صَبَبٌ: but AZ mentions his<br>\
having heard the Arabs apply ↓ صَبُوبٌ to a<br>\
declivity, or declivous place; and says that its pl.<br>\
is صُبُبٌ: (TA:) and الصَّبَبُ مِنَ الرَّمْلِ signifies<br>\
what has poured out or forth or down, of sand:<br>\
(M, K: *) and the pl. of صَبَبٌ is أَصْبَابٌ. (M, K.)<br>\
