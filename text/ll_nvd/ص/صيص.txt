صَاصَتِ النَّخْلَةُ, [aor. تَصِيصُ,] The palm-tree<br>\
bore dates which had become such as are termed<br>\
صِيص, i. e., شِيص; (K, * TA;) as also ↓ صيّصت,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. تَصْيِيصٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اصاصت, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. إِصَاصَةٌ; (TA;) all three on the authority of<br>\
IAar, and the first mentioned by Sgh, in the O;<br>\
and صَأْصَأَت, from صِئْصَآءٌ [a dial. var. of صِيصَآءٌ,<br>\
i. q. صِيصٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
صَيَّصَ see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
أَصْيَصَ see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
صِيصٌ, in the dial. of Belhárith Ibn-Kaab, The<br>\
[bad] kind of dates called حَشَفٌ; (S;) i. q. شِيصٌ;<br>\
as also ↓ صِيصَآءٌ; (K;) صِيصٌ and صِيصَآءٌ being<br>\
dial. vars. of شِيصٌ and شِيصَآءٌ. (S.)<br>\
صِيصَةٌ: see صِيصِيَةٌ, throughout.<br>\
صِيصَآءٌ: see صِيصٌ. [It is also said to signify]<br>\
Dates without stones. (L in art. لقح.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
The pips of a colocynth that have no hearts,<br>\
(AHn, S, K,) being husks only; (AHn;) to<br>\
which a poet likens ticks that have been long left<br>\
in a desolate place: (AHn, S: *) and so, accord.<br>\
to some, of anything, such as the melon and the<br>\
cucumber and the like. (AHn.)<br>\
صِيصِيَةٌ, (S, IB, O,) or ↓ صِيصَةٌ, (K,) thus in all<br>\
the copies of the K, but it is a mistake, or a contracted form, (TA,) The weaver&#39;s [implement<br>\
called] شَوْكَة, with which he makes the warp and<br>\
the woof even: (S, IB, K:) but IB says that its<br>\
last radical letter is ى, not ص; so that it should<br>\
be mentioned among the class of infirm words:<br>\
(TA;) pl. صَيَاصٍ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (S,) The spur<br>\
of the cock. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] The horn<br>\
of the bull or cow, and of the gazelle: (K:) pl.<br>\
as above, (TA,) signifying the horns of bulls or<br>\
cows; which were sometimes fixed upon spears,<br>\
instead of the iron heads: (S:) and to such horns,<br>\
called by this name, conflict and faction, or sedition, (فِتْنَة,) is likened in a trad., because of its<br>\
grievousness: some say that the sing. is صِيصَةٌ,<br>\
[as in the K,] contracted. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And hence,<br>\
(TA,) A wooden pin, or peg, with which dates<br>\
are plucked out [when they are compacted in a<br>\
mass, closely adhering together, in the receptacle<br>\
of woven palm-leaves, or the like, in which they<br>\
are packed]: (K:) likened to the horn of a bull<br>\
or cow: in this sense, the word is written صِيصَةٌ:<br>\
and a certain poet changes it to صِيصَجّ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence also,] Anything with which one defends himself: pl. as above, (K,) [in the CK<br>\
erroneously written صَيَاصِى, as though it had the<br>\
article ال prefixed to it, or were itself prefixed to<br>\
another noun, for otherwise it is written and pronounced] with the [final] ى elided. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
[Hence also,] A fortress: (K:) pl. in this sense<br>\
as above. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence also,] A pastor<br>\
who manages [and protects] well his herds or<br>\
flocks: (AA, K:) in this sense also written صِيصَةٌ.<br>\
(AA, as in the TA.)<br>\
