K,) He confined him; held him in custody;<br>\
detained, retained, restrained, or withheld, him,<br>\
or it; (S, M, A, K;) عَنْهُ from it. (M, A, K.)<br>\
[Accord. to a copy of the A, ↓ صبّرهُ signifies the<br>\
same; but this may be a mistranscription.<br>\
Hence,] صَبَرْتُ نَفْسِى I restrained, or withheld,<br>\
myself, or my soul; (S, Mgh;) عَلَى كَذَا [to<br>\
endure such a thing]. (Mgh.) &#39;Antarah says,<br>\
mentioning a battle in which he was engaged,<br>\
فَصَبَرْتُ عَارِفَةً لِذٰلِكَ حُرَّةً<br>\
تَرْسُوا إِذَا نَفْسُ الجَبَانِ تَطَلَّعُ<br>\
meaning حَبَسْتُ نَفْسًا صَابِرَةً [i. e. And I restrained<br>\
thereat a soul patient and ingenuous, that is firm<br>\
when the soul of the coward yearns: the last<br>\
word (for تَتَطَلَّعُ) I have here rendered on the<br>\
supposition that the poet describes the soul of the<br>\
coward as one that is yearning for home]. (S.)<br>\
[And hence,] صَبَرَ is also used intransitively:<br>\
(Msb:) [or as a trans. verb of which the objective<br>\
complement, namely, نَفْسَهُ, is understood:] you<br>\
say, صَبَرَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K,) He was, or became patient, or enduring;<br>\
contr. of جَزِعَ: (M, K:) or he restrained, or<br>\
withheld, himself, or his soul, from impatience:<br>\
(S, Msb:) or he restrained, or withheld, himself,<br>\
or his soul, from impatience, and his tongue from<br>\
complaint, and his members from broil: or,<br>\
accord. to Dhu-n-Noon, he shunned acts of opposition, and was calm in suffering the pangs of<br>\
afflictions, and made a show of competence in a<br>\
state of protracted poverty in places where the<br>\
means of subsistence were found: or, as some say,<br>\
he endured trial, or affliction, with good manners:<br>\
or he was contented in trial, or affliction, without<br>\
show of complaint: or he constrained himself to<br>\
attempt things that he disliked: or, accord. to<br>\
&#39;Amr Ibn-&#39;Othmán, he maintained constancy with<br>\
God, and received his trials with an unstraitened<br>\
mind: or, accord. to El-Khowwás, he steadily<br>\
adhered to the statutes of the Kur-án and the<br>\
Sunneh: or, as some say, he was content to<br>\
perish for gaining the approval of him whom he<br>\
loved: or, accord. to El-Hareeree, he made no<br>\
difference between a state of ease, comfort, and<br>\
affluence, and a state of affliction; preserving<br>\
calmness of mind in both states: (B:) and you<br>\
also say ↓ اِصْطَبَرَ, (S, M, Msb, K,) and ↓ اِصَّبَرَ, (S,<br>\
M, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, اصْبَرَّ,])<br>\
changing the ط into ص, but not اِطَّبَرَ, for ص is not<br>\
to be incorporated into ط; (S;) and likewise<br>\
↓ تصبّر; (M, K;) both syn. with صَبَرَ; (M;) or<br>\
↓ تصبّر signifies he constrained himself to be patient;<br>\
(S, TA;) [or he took patience: and ↓ اصطبر, he<br>\
acquired patience; and he was tried with patience:<br>\
see صَابِرٌ.] One says, صَبَرَ فُلَانٌ عِنْدَ المُصِيبَةِ Such<br>\
a one was patient on the occasion of affliction.<br>\
(S.) And صَبَرْتُ عَلَى مَا أَكْرَهُ [I was patient of,<br>\
or I endured with patience, or bore with, what<br>\
I dislike]. (A.) And صَبَرْتُ عَمَّا أُحِبُّ [I endured<br>\
with patience the withholding of myself, or the<br>\
being debarred, from what I love, or like; or I<br>\
was patient of the loss, or want, of what I love,<br>\
or like]: (A:) and عَنْهُ ↓ تَصَبَّرْتُ [I constrained<br>\
myself to endure with patience the withholding<br>\
myself, or the being debarred, from it, or him;<br>\
or I constrained myself to be patient of the loss,<br>\
or want, of it, or him]. (L, voce تَجَلَّدَ.) And<br>\
↓ أَفْضَلُ الصَّبْرِ التَّصَبُّرُ [The most excellent kind of<br>\
patience is the constraint of oneself to be patient]:<br>\
a saying of &#39;Omar. (IAar.) And بَدَنِى لَا يَصْبِرُ<br>\
عَلَى البَرْدِ (tropical:)  [My body will not be patient of cold,<br>\
or will not endure patiently cold]. (A.) And<br>\
صَبْرٌ signifies also The being bold or daring [in<br>\
enduring, or attempting, a thing]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
He made him, or it, firm, or fast; or bound, or<br>\

him, namely, a man, and other than man, [with<br>\
bonds or otherwise,] (K, TA,) alive, (TA,) and<br>\

he set him up for slaughter: (M:) and you say<br>\
also, قَتَلَهُ صَبْرًا; (S, M, Msb, K;) and صَبَرَهُ;<br>\
meaning he confined him (i. e. a man) to die,<br>\
until he died; and in like manner you say ↓ اصبرهُ;<br>\
(S;) which latter signifies also he slew him in<br>\
retaliation. (T in art. بوأ.) And قُتِلَ صَبْرًا He<br>\
(i. e. any living thing) was confined alive, and<br>\
then shot at, or cast at, until he was put to death:<br>\
(S:) or he (any living thing) was bound until he<br>\
was put to death: (Msb:) or he (a man) was<br>\
bound hand and foot, or held by another man,<br>\
until he was beheaded: (Mgh:) or he was slain<br>\
[deliberately,] not on the field of battle, nor in<br>\
war or fight, nor by mistake: (A &#39;Obeyd:) and<br>\
صُبِرَ he was confined, (A,) or held and confined,<br>\
(B,) to be put to death. (A, B.) صَبْرُ الرُّوحِ [signifies The confining the living, and shooting, or<br>\
casting, at him until he dies; as is shown in the<br>\
TA: but it] occurs in a trad., in which it is forbidden, as meaning the act of gelding, or castrating. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (S, Msb,) aor. and inf. n.<br>\
as above, (Msb,) He confined him to make him<br>\
swear, until he swore, or took an oath; as also<br>\
↓ اصبرهُ: (S:) or he made him to swear a most<br>\
energetic oath; (Msb;) as also صَبَرَ يَمِينَهُ, (A,<br>\
Mgh,) which is a tropical phrase: (A:) and<br>\
↓ اصبرهُ, (TA in art. بلت,) or عَلَى يَمِينٍ ↓ اصبرهُ,<br>\
(TA in the present art.,) he (the judge, or<br>\
governor,) constrained him to swear, or take an<br>\
oath. (TA.) And صُبِرَ He was confined, or held<br>\
in custody, in order that he might be made to<br>\
swear, or take an oath. (A.) And حَلَفَ صَبْرًا He<br>\
swore, or took an oath, being confined, or held in<br>\
custody, (S, M,) by the judge, or governor, (M,)<br>\
in order that he might be made to do so. (S, M.)<br>\

an explanation of the pass. part. n. مَصْبُورٌ, q. v.,])<br>\

the K, [both probably correct,]) They collected<br>\
their wheat together without measuring or weighing it; made it a صُبْرَة [q. v.] (M, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
صبّرهُ, (M, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَصْبِيرٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He urged him, or made him, to be patient, by a<br>\
promise of reward: or he said to him, Be thou<br>\
patient: and ↓ صَبَرَهُ he made him to be patient:<br>\
(Msb:) or the former, he commanded him, or<br>\
enjoined him, to be patient; as also ↓ اصبرهُ: (M,<br>\
K:) and the first, he required of him that he<br>\
should be patient: (Sgh, TA:) and ↓ اصبرهُ, he<br>\
attributed to him (جَعَلَ لَهُ) patience; (M, K;) as<br>\

endurance; as shown in what follows: or] he<br>\
acted patiently with him: (MA:) صَابِرُوا in the<br>\
Kur iii. last verse means Vie ye in patience, or<br>\
endurance: (Ksh, Bd, Jel: *) or in this instance,<br>\
in the saying اِصْبِرُوا وَصَابِرُوا وَرَابِطُوا, the three<br>\
verbs are progressive in meaning; the first meaning less than the second; and the second, less than<br>\
the third: or the meaning is, [be ye patient] with<br>\
yourselves, and [vie ye in patience] with your<br>\
hearts in enduring trial with respect to God, and<br>\

مَصْبُورَة, i. e. detained; but this explanation is of<br>\
weak authority: or, accord. to AHn, clouds<br>\
remaining stationary a day and a night; as<br>\
though detained: (M:) or clouds in which are<br>\
blackness and whiteness: or, as some say, clouds<br>\
slow in motion, by reason of their heaviness and<br>\
the abundance of their water: (Ham p. 786:) the<br>\
pl. of صَبِيرٌ is the same as the sing., (M,) or it is<br>\
صُبُرٌ. (S, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And صَبِيرٌ, A mountain:<br>\
(O, K:) or الصَّبِيرُ is the name of a particular<br>\
mountain. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And accord. to Freytag, as<br>\
from the K, in which I do not find this meaning,<br>\
A hill consisting of stones.]<br>\
-A3-  Also صَبِيرٌ, (K,)<br>\
i. e. (TA) the صَبِير of a خَوَان [or table, or thing<br>\
upon which one eats], (M, A, TA,) A thin,<br>\
round cake of bread, which is spread beneath the<br>\
food that one eats: (M, A, K:) or (K, TA, but<br>\
in the CK “ and ”) upon which the food to be<br>\
eaten at a wedding-feast is ladled (K, TA) by<br>\
the maker of the bread: (TA:) also called ↓ صَبِيرَةٌ.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
صَبَارَةٌ: see the next paragraph:<br>\
-A2-  and see<br>\
صَبَارَّةٌ.<br>\
صُبَارَةٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ صَبَارَةٌ and ↓ صِبَارَةٌ (K)<br>\
Stones: (S, M, K:) or smooth stones: (TA:) or<br>\
صُبَارَةٌ signifies, (M,) or صَبَارَةٌ signifies also, (K,)<br>\
a piece of stone, or portion of stones: or of iron.<br>\
(M, K.) A poet says, (S,) namely, El-Aashà,<br>\
(M,) or &#39;Amr Ibn-Milkat Et-Tá-ee, addressing<br>\
&#39;Amr Ibn-Hind, who had a brother slain, (IB,)<br>\
مَنْ مُبْلِغٌ عَمْرًا بِأَنَّ المَرْءَ لَمْ يُخْلَقْ صُبَارَهْ<br>\
(so in the S; but in the M and TA this verse is<br>\
given differently, with شَيْبَانَ and أَنَّ in the places<br>\
of عَمْرًا and بِأَنَّ; and it is said in the M that<br>\
accord. to one relation the last word is صِيَارَهْ,<br>\
[with ى,] which, it is added, is like صُبَارَه in<br>\
meaning;) [i. e. Who will tell &#39;Amr, or Sheybán,<br>\
that man was not created stones?] but IB says<br>\
that the last word is correctly صِبَارَهْ, with kesr to<br>\
the ص; and the poet means, man is not stone,<br>\
that he should patiently endure the like of this:<br>\
(TA:) [J says,] accord. to one relation, the last<br>\
word is صَبَارَهْ, with fet-h, which is pl. of ↓ صَبَارٌ,<br>\
the صَبَارٌ being affixed to denote its being a pl. pl.,<br>\
for صَبْرَةٌ is pl. of ↓ signifying strong, or hard,<br>\
stones: [and he adds,] El-Aashà says,<br>\
↓ قُبَيْلَ الصُّبْحِ أَصْوَاتُ الصَّبَارِ<br>\
(S:) but IB says that صَبَارٌ and صَبَارَةٌ are not pls.<br>\
of صَبْرَةٌ; for فَعَالٌ is not a pl. form, but فِعَالٌ, with<br>\
kesr, like حِجَارٌ and جِبَالٌ: (TA:) [and it is said<br>\
that] the verse from which this is cited is not by<br>\
El-Aashà, and is correctly and completely as<br>\
follows:<br>\
كَأَنَّ تَرَنُّمَ الهَاجَاتِ فِيهَا<br>\
قُبَيْلَ الصُّبْحِ أَصْوَاتُ الصِّيَارِ<br>\
by الصيار being meant the صَنْج, (TS, K, TA,)<br>\
the stringed instrument thus called: (TS, TA:)<br>\
accord. to the reading given in the S, the verse<br>\
means, As though the croaking of the frogs in it,<br>\
a little before daybreak, were the sounds of<br>\
falling stones: and this is correct. (TA.)<br>\

absolute sense] intenseness of cold: (TA:) and<br>\
↓ صَبْرَةٌ signifies also the middle of winter; (K;)<br>\

copies of the K: (TA:) from ↓ صُبْرٌ, q. v.; (S,<br>\
M;) or from صُبَارَةٌ: or, accord. to some, such as<br>\
is level, abounding with stones, and difficult to<br>\
walk upon: (M:) or the former is [the tract<br>\
called] حَرَّةُ لَيْلَى, and [that called] حَرَّةُ النَّارِ: (ElFezáree:) or it has the first of the above-mentioned significations, and signifies also a [mountain, or hill, such as is termed] هَضْبَة: (ISk:) or<br>\
smooth rock upon which nothing makes an impression: but the latter, accord. to Aboo-&#39;Amr<br>\
Esh-Sheybánee, signifies a هَضْبَة without a pass.<br>\
(ISh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also أُمُّ صَبَّارٍ (M, K) and ↓ أًمُّ صَبُّورٍ (S,<br>\
M, K) A calamity, or misfortune: and a severe<br>\
war: (M, K:) or the latter, a distressing case.<br>\

(S, M) They fell into a calamity, &amp;c.: (M:) or<br>\
the latter, they fell into a distressing case: (S:)<br>\
or into a perplexing and distressing case, from<br>\
which they could not escape, like the هَضْبَة, above<br>\
mentioned, without a pass: (Aboo-&#39;Amr EshSheybánee:) but in some of the copies of the<br>\

from صِيَارَةٌ, signifying “ stones. ” (TA.)<br>\

intense degree of patience; [or having very great<br>\
patience;] denoting measure, and quantity: the<br>\

signifies The Clement, or Forbearing, who does<br>\
not hastily avenge Himself upon the disobedient,<br>\
