اصنى النَّخْلُ The palm-trees had pairs, or<br>\
triplets, or more, growing together from single<br>\
roots. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\
صَنْوٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
صُنْوٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
صِنْوٌ One of a pair, (AHn, S, M, K,) or of three,<br>\
(S, M,) or of more than two, (K,) or of more than<br>\
three, (M,) or of five, or of six, (TA,) of palmtrees, (S, M, K,) or of any trees, (AHn, M, K,) or of<br>\
trees resembling one another, (M,) growing from<br>\
one root; (AHn, S, M, K;) each [or every one] of<br>\
such being called the صِنْو of the other [or others<br>\
growing with it]; (AHn, M;) as also ↓ صُنْوٌ, (M,<br>\
K,) mentioned by Zj: (M:) two of such are<br>\
termed صِنْوَانِ (S, K) and صُنْوَانِ and صَنْوَانِ,<br>\
[which last implies that ↓ صَنْوٌ as well as صُنْوٌ is a<br>\
dial. var. of صِنْوٌ,] and also صِنْيَانِ and صُنْيَانِ and<br>\
صَنْيَانِ, [which imply that صِنْىٌ and صُنْىٌ and<br>\
صَنْىٌ are also dial. vars. of صِنْوٌ and صُنْوٌ and صَنْوٌ;]<br>\
(K;) and the pl. is صِنْوَانٌ (AZ, S, M) and [of<br>\
pauc.] أَصْنَآءٌ, (M,) the former pl. differing from<br>\
the first of the duals mentioned above by being<br>\
perfectly decl. (AZ, S, * TA.) Hence, in the Kur<br>\
[xiii. 4], صِنْوَانٍ وَغَيْرُِ صِنْوَانٍ, (TA,) i. e. Palmtrees having one root and [others] having distinct<br>\
roots: Hafs read صُنْوَان, like قُنْوَان pl. of قِنْوٌ; of<br>\
the dial. of Temeem. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (TA,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A brother; but not so called unless coupled<br>\
with another: (Sh, TA:) or a brother by the same<br>\
father: (Az, TA:) [or a brother by the same<br>\
mother; as is indicated by an explanation of one<br>\
of the pls in what follows:] or a brother such as<br>\
is termed شقِيق, (M, K,) which means by the<br>\
father and mother: (TA in art. شق:) and a<br>\
son; (M, K;) because he has branched forth<br>\
from one stock [with his father]: (TA:) and a<br>\
paternal uncle; (M, K;) but this last meaning is<br>\
taken from a trad. cited in what follows: (TA:)<br>\
the fem. is with ة: and the pl. is أَصْنَآءٌ [a pl. of<br>\
pauc.] and صِنْوَانٌ [as above]. (M, K.) It is said<br>\
in a trad., عَمُّ الرَّجُلِ صِنْوُ أَبِيهِ (tropical:)  [The paternal<br>\
uncle of the man is the صِنْو of his father]; (T, S;)<br>\
meaning that the stock of both is one. (T, TA.)<br>\
[And it is said that] صَنْوَانٌ وغَيْرُ صِنْوَانٍ, relating<br>\
to a man&#39;s children, means (assumed tropical:)  Sons of one mother<br>\
by different fathers, and children of different<br>\
mothers by one father. (Har p. 608.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence<br>\
the pl.] أَصْنَآءٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  Likes, or fellows.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And رَكِيَّتَانِ صِنْوَانِ (tropical:)  Two wells<br>\
near together, (AZ, S, M, K, TA,) or (so in the<br>\
TA and in some copies of the K) that yield water<br>\
from one spring. (AZ, S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  صِنْوٌ also<br>\
signifies A widened well (حَفَرٌ) from which water<br>\
is not drawn and of the water of which no use is<br>\
made: (Ibn-Buzurj, K:) pl. صِنْوَانٌ. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See also what follows.<br>\
صُنَىٌّ A small حِسْى [q. v.] to which no one<br>\
comes for water, (S, K,) and for which no one<br>\
cares: dim. of ↓ صِنْوٌ: (S:) or, as some say, (S,)<br>\
a cleft in a mountain: (S, TA:) or a ravine, or<br>\
gap, (شِعْبٌ,) in which water flows, between two<br>\
mountains. (TA.)<br>\
