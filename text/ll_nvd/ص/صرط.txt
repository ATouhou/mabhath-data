[The name of] a bridge extended over the midst<br>\
of Hell, (K, TA,) sharper than a sword, and<br>\
thinner than a hair, over which the creatures<br>\
will pass, the people of Paradise passing over it<br>\
with their works, some like the blinding lightning,<br>\
and some like the wind sent forth, and some like<br>\
coursers, and some running, and some walking,<br>\
and some dragging themselves along; and a crier<br>\
will cry, from the lower parts of the empyrean,<br>\
“ Lower your eyes until Fátimeh, the daughter<br>\
of Mohammad, (may God bless and save him, and<br>\
may God be well pleased with her and her two<br>\
sons,) pass over; ” and the fire will say to the<br>\
believer, “Pass thou over, O believer, for thy<br>\
light hath extinguished my flame; ” and thereupon, the feet of the people of the fire will slip.<br>\
