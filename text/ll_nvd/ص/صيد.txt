i. q. صاد فِيهِ [He took &amp;c., or sought to take &amp;c.,<br>\
game, or wild animals, or the like, in the place]:<br>\
Sb mentions, as a phrase of the Arabs, صِدْنَا قَنَوَيْنِ<br>\
meaning صِدْنَا وَحْشَ قَنَوَيْنِ: قَنَوَانِ being the name<br>\
of a certain land [or of two mountains]. (M.)<br>\
And الصَّقْرُ يَصِيدُ [The hawk preys]. (Msb and<br>\
K in art. صقر.) ذَوَاتُ الصَّيْدِ is applied to beasts<br>\
and to birds [That prey upon others; predatory].<br>\
(S and K in art. جرج, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says,<br>\
هُوَ يَصِيدُ النَّاسَ بِالمَعْرُوفِ (tropical:)  [He captivates men by<br>\
goodness, beneficence, or kindness]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
اِقْتَصِدْ تَصِدْ (tropical:)  Aim thou at that which is right and<br>\

M, L;) and صَادَ, (Lth, M, L,) [aor. يَصِيدُ;] He<br>\
(a camel) had the disease termed صَيَدٌ [expl.<br>\
below]: (Lth, S, M, L:) the ى in صَيِدَ is preserved unchanged because it is so preserved in the<br>\
original form, which is ↓ اِصْيَدَّ, (S,) though they<br>\
may not have said اِصْيَدَّ; (Sb, M;) and the like<br>\
is the case in عَوِرَ: (Sb, * S, M: *) the augmentative letters are rejected for the purpose of alleviation: hence, one does not say, in the case of verbs<br>\
of this class, مَا أَفْعَلَهُ, [i. e. مَا أَصْيَدَهُ, and مَا أَعُوَرَهُ,<br>\
and the like,] forming thus verbs of wonder,<br>\
because the original form is augmented, and a<br>\
verb of four letters cannot be formed from a verb<br>\
of four letters, for a measure can only be formed<br>\
from a measure that is less. (S.) Also, both<br>\
verbs, (the former accord. to the S and M, and<br>\
↓ the latter likewise accord. to the M,) (assumed tropical:)  He (a<br>\
man) was unable to look aside, (S, M,) by reason<br>\
of disease. (S.) And صَيِدَ, inf. n. صَيَدٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
raised his head, by reason of pride: and (assumed tropical:)  he (a<br>\

neck. (K, TA. [See also 4.])<br>\

He, or it, [app. meaning the vein called صَاد, or<br>\

(K;) namely, a camel. (TK.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He cured<br>\
him (i. e. a camel, TK) of the disease termed صَيَد,<br>\
(K, TA,) by burning with a hot iron. (TA.)<br>\
Thus it has two contr. significations. (K.) ―<br>\

K:) or any wild animal, or wild animals,<br>\
