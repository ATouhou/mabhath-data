صَوَّى صُوًى He made صُوًى [i. e. signs set<br>\
up for the guidance of travellers] in the way.<br>\
(TA. [The verb is originally صَوَّوَ: and صُوًى is<br>\
pl. of صُوَّةٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  [See also art. صوى.]<br>\
4<br>\
اصوى القَوْمُ The people, or party, alighted<br>\
in what are termed صُوًى, meaning elevated [or<br>\
rugged and elevated] tracts of land. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [See also art. صوى.]<br>\
صَوٌّ i. q. فَارِغٌ, (K,) so in the Tekmileh, (TA,)<br>\
applied to a thing, meaning Empty, void, or<br>\
vacant. (TK.)<br>\
صَوَّةٌ: see what follows, near the end.<br>\
صُوَّةٌ A sign for the guidance of travellers, consisting of stones, (AA, S, IAth, Msb,) set up<br>\
(IAth, Msb) in the way (Msb) in an unknown<br>\
desert: (IAth:) or a stone that is a sign [for<br>\
guidance] in the way: (M, K:) or an elevated<br>\
sign of the way, set up in rugged ground: (M:)<br>\
pl. صُوًى (AA, S, M, IAth, Msb) and pl. pl.<br>\
أَصْوَآءٌ, (M, Msb, K,) the latter like أَرْطَابٌ pl. of<br>\
رُطَبٌ, (Msb, TA,) or, as some say, this is a pl.,<br>\
not a pl. pl. (TA.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّ<br>\
لِلْإِسْلَامِ صُوًى وَمَنَارًا كَمَنَارِ الطَّرِيقِ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily ElIslám has signs and marks of guidance like those<br>\
of the way]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence [the pl.] أًصْوَآءٌ is<br>\
applied to signify Graves: (S:) occurring in a<br>\
trad. in this sense. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And the sing., (S,<br>\
K,) accord. to As, (S,) signifies Rugged and<br>\
elevated ground, (S, K,) but inferior to a mountain: (S:) or an elevated and a rugged spot, upon<br>\
which, sometimes, stones are set up in order that<br>\
one may be directed thereby to the right way;<br>\
like ثُوَّةٌ. (M in art. ثو.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A place of<br>\
varying, or of coming and going, (مُخْتَلَف) of<br>\
the wind: (S, K:) a poet says, (namely, Imra-el-<br>\
Keys, TA,)<br>\
وَهَبَّتْ لَهُ رِيحٌ بِمُخْتَلَفِ الصُّوَى<br>\
[meaning, if the explanation be correct, and the<br>\
citation appropriate, And a wind blew them<br>\
(referring to the word جَمْر, i. e. live coals, in a<br>\
verse immediately preceding) in the place of<br>\
varying of the places of varying of the wind]:<br>\
(S:) but Aboo-Zekereeyà, in the margin of his<br>\
book [or his copy of the S], throws doubt upon<br>\
the word meaning “ wind ” [in this explanation].<br>\
(TA. [See De Slane&#39;s “ Diwan d&#39;Amro&#39;lkais,”<br>\
p. 20 of the Arabic text and p. 34 of his translation.])<br>\
-A2-  Also An assemblage of beasts, or birds,<br>\
of prey: (M, K:) on the authority of Kr. (M.)<br>\
-A3-  And The sound of the echo: (K:) mentioned<br>\
by Az; but written by him with fet-h [i. e.<br>\
↓ صَوَّةٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  أَخَذَهُ بِصُوَاهُ, expl. in the K as<br>\
meaning He took it in its fresh state (بِطَرَآءَتِهِ [in<br>\
the CK erroneously باَطْرافِه]), is a mistranscription; correctly, بِصَرَاهُ, with fet-h to the ص, and<br>\
with ر, as written by Az. (TA. [صَرًا and صَرَاوَةٌ,<br>\
both omitted in the K, are expl. in their proper<br>\
place in the TA as syn. with جِدَّةٌ and غَضَاضَةٌ.])<br>\
