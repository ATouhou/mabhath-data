صَفَعَ, (O, Msb, K,) inf. n. صَفْعٌ, (S, *<br>\
O, Msb, TA,) accord. to Lth, (O, TA,) He<br>\
struck him with his fist, not vehemently, on the<br>\
back of his neck: (O, K, TA:) or, (O, K,)<br>\
accord. to Az (O, Msb, TA) and others, (Msb,)<br>\
he struck him [i. e. slapped him] with his<br>\
expanded hand (O, Msb, K, TA) on the back of<br>\
his neck, or on his body; not with the fist: (O,<br>\
Msb, TA:) or it is post-classical: (S, K:) [but<br>\
Fei says,] the assertion that it is post-classical is not<br>\
to be regarded: (Msb:) Az adds, IDrd says that<br>\
it is from ↓ صَوْفَعَةٌ, (O, TA,) which signifies the<br>\
top, or uppermost part, of the [cap called] كُمَّة,<br>\
and of the turban: (O, K, TA:) or this is a mistranscription, and is correctly with ق: (K, TA:)<br>\
[Sgh says,] this which Az mentions, [as] on the<br>\
authority of IDrd, I have not found in the Jm;<br>\
and it is correctly with ق. (O.)<br>\
صَفْعَةٌ A single act of striking [or slapping]<br>\
with the expanded hand upon the back of the neck,<br>\
or upon the body. (Msb.)<br>\
صَفْعَانُ or صَفْعَانٌ (accord. to different copies of<br>\
the S and K) A man who is struck [or slapped]<br>\
in the manner expl. above in the first paragraph;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ مَصْفَعَانِىٌّ. (O, K.)<br>\
