(K;) He ascended, or went up, the ladder, or<br>\
stair: (L, Msb, K:) and so the verb is used of<br>\
ascending a thing similar to a ladder, or stair:<br>\
but in a case of this kind one should not say<br>\
اصعد. (L.) And صَعِدَ السَّطْحَ and إِلَى السَّطْحِ<br>\
(A, Msb) He ascended, or ascended to, the flat<br>\
house-top. (Msb.) And صَعِدَ المَكَانَ, and فِى<br>\

الجَبَلِ, (S, A, Msb, K,) and عَلَى الجَبَلِ, inf. n.<br>\
تَصْعِيدٌ; (S, K;) and صَعِدَ فِيهِ, a form rarely used,<br>\
(Msb,) disallowed by AZ, (S, TA,) and said by<br>\
him to have been unknown, (S,) or unheard,<br>\
(K,) but he afterwards authorized it, and it is also<br>\
authorized by IAar and ISk, (TA,) and صَعِدَ<br>\
الجَبَلَ; (S in art. دخل; [for صَعِدَ فِى الجَبَلِ,<br>\
see دَخَلْتُ البَيْتَ;]) and فِيهِ ↓ تصعّد, (MF, from<br>\
a trad.,) and اِصَّعَّدَ فِيهِ, (AZ,) inf. n. اِصِّعَّادٌ; (TA;<br>\
[app. a mistranscription for اِصَّعُّدٌ; or اِصَّعَّدَ may<br>\
be a mistranscription for ↓ اِصَّعَدَ, a var. of اِصْطَعَدَ,<br>\
and its inf. n. is اِصِّعَادٌ;]) He ascended the mountain. (Msb, K.) And فِى الأَرْضِ ↓ صعّد He<br>\
ascended the land. (AZ, TA.) One says, طَالَ<br>\
↓ فِى الأَرْضِ تَصْوِيبِى وَتَصْعِيدِى [Long have continued my descending, or going down, and my<br>\
ascending, or going up, in the land]. (A. [There<br>\

above: see also رَكَبٌ مُصَعِّدٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  See also 4, last<br>\
sentence.<br>\
2<br>\
صعّد, inf. n. تَصْعِيدٌ, as intrans.: see above,<br>\
in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  And see also 4, in four places.<br>\
-A2-  صعّدهُ He made him, or caused him, to ascend,<br>\
or mount; syn. عَلَّاهُ; (K and TA in art. علو;)<br>\
and رَقَّاهُ; (TA in art. رقى;) [and so ↓ اصعدهُ; and<br>\
↓ استصعدهُ; like as one says in the contr. sense<br>\
نَزَّلَهُ and أَنْزَلَهُ and اِسْتَنْزَلَهُ.] You say, صعّدهُ جَبَلًا<br>\
and دَابَّةٌ [He made him to ascend, or mount, a<br>\
mountain and a beast]. (TA in art. علو.) And<br>\
فِى الجَبَلِ ↓ يُصْعِدُونَهَا is said with reference to<br>\
wild bulls or cows [as meaning They make them<br>\
to ascend upon the mountain]. (S and TA in art.<br>\
سلع.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says also, صَعَّدَ فِىَّ النَّظَرَ<br>\
وَصَوَّبَهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He looked at me from head to<br>\
foot, contemplating me. (L, from a trad. [And<br>\
a similar phrase occurs in Har p. 640.]) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[صعّدهُ, inf. n. تَصْعِيدٌ, (the latter as used in the<br>\
K voce كَافُورٌ,) also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He sublimated it:<br>\
often occurring in medical books, and used in this<br>\
sense in the present day.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And تَصْعِيدٌ signifies<br>\
also The act of liquifying, melting, or dissolving.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
-A3-  See also 4, last sentence.<br>\

اصعد فِى المَكَانِ: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اصعد<br>\
فِى الأَرْضِ He went through the land towards a<br>\
land higher than the other [from which he came]:<br>\
(A, TA:) taken from the saying of Lth, that<br>\
اصعد, inf. n. إِصْعَادٌ, signifies He went towards a<br>\
declivity, or a river, or a valley, higher than the<br>\
other [from which he came]. (TA.) And اصعد<br>\
فِى البِلَادِ He went up, or upwards, through the<br>\
countries, or lands. (AA, Msb.) And اصعد<br>\
مِنْ بَلَدِ كَذَا إِلَى بَلَدِ كَذَا He journeyed [upwards] from such a region, or town, to such<br>\
another region, or town; from one that was lower<br>\
to one that was higher. (Msb.) [And hence,]<br>\
اصعد, inf. n. إِصْعَادٌ, He journeyed, or went,<br>\
towards Nejd, and El-Hijáz, and El-Yemen:<br>\
[or towards a higher region:] and اِنْحَدَرَ signifies<br>\
“ he journeyed, or went, towards El-&#39;Irák, and<br>\
Syria, and &#39;Omán: ” (ISk, on the authority of<br>\
&#39;Omárah:) or the former, he journeyed, or went,<br>\
towards the Kibleh: and the latter, “he journeyed, or went, towards El-&#39;Irák: ” (Aboo-<br>\
Sakhr, T:) or the former, he came to Mekkeh;<br>\
(K;) but this is a defective explanation: (TA:)<br>\
and مُصْعَدٌ, also, is used as an inf. n. of this verb;<br>\
and مُنْحَدَرٌ, as an inf. n. of انحدر: (T, TA:)<br>\
or اصعد, inf. n. إِصْعَادٌ, he commenced a journey,<br>\
or went forth; as from Mekkeh, and from ElKoofeh to Khurásán, and the like: (Fr:) or he<br>\
commenced a journey, or the like, in any direction:<br>\
and انحدر signifies “ he returned, from any<br>\
town or country. ” (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh.) And اصعد<br>\
فِى الأَرْضِ, (Akh, S, K,) or فى البِلَادِ, (Akh<br>\
accord. to the T,) He went away, and journeyed,<br>\
through the land, (Akh, S, K,) or through the<br>\
countries, (Akh, T,) in any direction. (L.) And<br>\
اصعدت السَّفِينَةُ, inf. n. إِصْعَادٌ; (L;) or ↓ صعّدت;<br>\
(A;) The ship spread her sail, and was borne<br>\
along by the wind, (A, L,) upwards [app. meaning<br>\
up a river or the like]. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اصعد فِى الوَادِى;<br>\
(Akh, S, L, K;) and فِيهِ ↓ صعّد, inf. n. تَصْعِيدٌ;<br>\
(Akh, S, Msb, K;) and ↓ اِصَّعَّدَ, (Lth,) but this<br>\
last is disapproved by Az; (TA;) He descended,<br>\
or went down, into the valley, (Akh, S, L, Msb,<br>\
K,) from the part whence the torrent comes; not<br>\
going to the bottom of the valley: and in like<br>\
manner, اصعد فِى الأَرْضِ He descended, or went<br>\
down, into the land: (L:) and فِى الجَبَلِ ↓ صعّد<br>\
He descended the mountain; as well as he ascended it. (IB, L.) Akh cites the following<br>\
words of &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Hemmám Es-Saloolee,<br>\
طَوْرًا فِى البِلَادِ وَأُفْرِعُ ↓ أُصَعِّدُ<br>\
(S, L,) as meaning I descending, or going down,<br>\
at one time, through the countries, and [another<br>\
time] ascending, or going up: this, says IB, is<br>\
what induced Akh to explain صعّد as he has done;<br>\
but it presents no proof, because إِفْرَاعٌ has two<br>\
contr. significations, that of إِصْعَادٌ and that of<br>\
اِنْحِدَارٌ: and accord. to AZ, by أُصَعِّدُ the poet<br>\
means I ascending, or going up, to high places;<br>\
and by أُفْرِعُ, the contrary. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اصعد also<br>\
signifies He advanced towards another. (L.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And He went far; syn. أَبْعَدَ. (Ham p. 22.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
And اصعد فِى العَدْوِ He exerted himself vehemently in running. (L.)<br>\
-A2-  اصعد as trans.: see<br>\
2, in two places.<br>\
-A3-  اصعدت She (a camel) became<br>\
such as is termed صَعُود [q. v.]. (S, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And أَصْعَدْتُ النَّاقَةَ, (S, L, K,) and ↓ صَعَدْتُهَا,<br>\
[probably imperfectly transcribed for ↓ صَعَّدْتُهَا,]<br>\
(L,) I made the she-camel to be, or became, such<br>\
as is termed صَعُود. (IAar, S, L, K.)<br>\

thing, S, K, or an affair, A) was, or became,<br>\
difficult, or distressing, to him; it distressed, or<br>\

as signifying “ a mountain-road difficult of ascent: ”<br>\
(A&#39; Obeyd:) or from الصَّعُودٌ as the name of “ a<br>\
certain mountain in Hell. ” (TA.)<br>\

-b2-  عَذَابٌ صَعَدٌ<br>\

distressing, or an afflicting, punishment, (Bd and<br>\
Jel in lxxii. 17,) that shall overcome the sufferer thereof, the latter word being an inf. n. used<br>\
as an epithet. (TA.)<br>\
صُعُدٌ an inf. n. of صَعِدَ [q. v.]. (Ham p. 407.)<br>\
[Hence,] ذَهَبَ السَّهْمُ صُعُدًا [The arrow went<br>\
upwards]. (A.) And هٰذَا النَّبَاتُ يَنْمِى صُعُدًا<br>\
This plant increases in height. (S.) And تَنَفَّسَ<br>\
صُعُدًا: see صُعَدَآءُ. And ↓ مِنْ صُعْدٍ [used by<br>\
poetic license for من صُعُدٍ], said of a thing<br>\
falling, i. e. From above; from a higher place.<br>\
(Ham p. 349.)<br>\
-A2-  Also a pl. of صَعُودٌ: and of<br>\
صَعِيدٌ. (S, L, K.)<br>\
-A3-  صُعُدٌ, thus, with two dammehs, is also the name of A certain tree from<br>\
which pitch is melted forth. (L.)<br>\
صَعْدَةٌ A high, or an elevated, piece of land or<br>\
ground; contr. of هَبْطَةٌ. (Mgh in art. هبط.)<br>\
And صَعْدَةُ is said to be a proper name for The<br>\
earth. (Ham p.22.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A she-ass: (L,<br>\
K:) or a long-backed she-ass: (L:) or long [in<br>\
the back], applied to a she-ass as an epithet, and<br>\
therefore the pl. is صَعْدَاتٌ, with the ع quiescent.<br>\
(Ham p. 385.) And بَنَاتُ صَعْدَةَ Wild asses: (S,<br>\
K:) said to be so called from صَعْدَةُ meaning as<br>\
expl. above; and if this be correct, it is like the<br>\
appellation بَنَاتُ البَرِّ: (Ham p. 22:) or as being<br>\
likened to the women [or rather woman (as will<br>\
be shown in what follows)] termed صعدة; and in<br>\
like manner, أَوْلَادُ صَعْدَةَ: (Har p. 471:) the<br>\
rel. n. [applied to a single wild ass] is ↓ صَاعِدِىٌّ,<br>\
(S, L, K,) irregularly formed: thus in the saying<br>\
of Aboo-Dhu-eyb,<br>\
فَرَمَى فَأَلْحَقَ صَاعِدِيًّا مِطْحَرًا<br>\
بِالكَشْحِ فَاشْتَمَلَتْ عَلَيْهِ الأَضْلُعُ<br>\

[simply] an أَلَّة: (K, TA:) [in the CK اٰلَة: and]<br>\
in some copies of the K أَكَمَة, which is a mistranscription: (TA:) pl. صِعَادٌ and صَعَدَاتٌ; (L;)<br>\
the latter with fet-h to the ع because it is a<br>\
subst. (Ham p. 385.) One says, تَطَاعَنُوا بِالصِّعَادِ<br>\
i. e. [They thrust, or pierced, one another] with<br>\
the spears. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,] جَارِيَةٌ صَعْدَةٌ (tropical:)  A<br>\
girl, or young woman, straight in figure, (A, L,)<br>\
like a spear, or spear-shaft: (L:) pl. جَوَارٍ صَعْدَاتٌ,<br>\

or تنفّس صُعَدَآءَ, (A,) and ↓ تنفّس صُعُدًا, (L,) He<br>\
sighed; uttered a sigh or sighing; or breathed with<br>\
an expression of pain, grief, or sorrow: (L:)<br>\
[or uttered a prolonged breathing:] or breathed<br>\

evidently mistranscribed,]) (tropical:)  Such a one raises his<br>\
head, and does not stoop it, by reason of pride:<br>\

that art.) [Hence,] الصَّعُودُ A certain mountain<br>\
in Hell, (L, K, MF,) consisting of fire, which<br>\
the unbeliever will ascend during a period of<br>\
seventy years, after which he will fall down it,<br>\
and thus he will do for ever: (MF:) it is of one<br>\
live coal; the unbeliever will be compelled to ascend<br>\
it, and will be beaten with مَقَامِع [pl. of مِقْمَعَةٌ,<br>\
q. v.]; and whenever he puts his leg upon it, it<br>\

opinion among the lexicologists on this point:<br>\

iv. 46 and v. 9; and therefore in performing the<br>\
act termed التَّيَمَّم,] a man should strike his hands<br>\
upon the surface of the earth, and not care whether<br>\
there be in chat place dust or not: (Zj:) [hence]<br>\
one says, طَارَ صِيتُكَ فِى القَرِيبِ وَالبَعِيدِ وَبَلَغَ مُنْتَهَى<br>\
الصَّعِيدِ [Thy fame has flown through the near and<br>\
the distant regions, and reached the extremity of<br>\

upwards: (K, TA:) and أَخَذْتُهُ بِدِرْهَمٍ فَصَاعِدًا<br>\
(tropical:)  I got it for a dirhem and upwards; an elliptical<br>\
phrase, for أَخَذْتُهُ بِدِرْهَمٍ فَزَادَ الثَّمَنُ صَاعِدًا I got<br>\
it for a dirhem and the price increased upwards,<br>\
or ذَهَبَ صَاعِدًا went upwards: you may not say<br>\
وَصَاعِدًا, because you do not mean to tell that the<br>\
dirhem with something more made the price, as<br>\
when you say بِدِرْهَمٍ وَزِيَادَةٍ; but you mention the<br>\
lowest price that you offered, and mean that you<br>\
then offered more and more. (Sb, L.) And<br>\
قَرَأَ فَاتِحَةَ الكِتَابِ فَصَاعِدًا (assumed tropical:)  He read the opening<br>\
