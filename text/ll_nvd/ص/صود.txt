صوّد الصَّادَ, inf. n. تَصْوِيدٌ, He wrote the صاد<br>\
[i. e. the letter ص]. (K.)<br>\
صَادٌ The name of one of the letters of the alphabet. (M, L. [See art. ص.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is also The<br>\
title of a سُورَة, the thirty-eighth chapter of the<br>\
Kur-án.] If you make it a sign of the سورة, you<br>\
write it as a single letter, and make it indeclinable<br>\
with its last letter quiescent [in pronunciation]:<br>\
if you make it a name for the سورة, you write it<br>\
as [it is pronounced] in spelling; and say صَادِ,<br>\
with kesr, because of the concurrence of two<br>\
quiescent letters [in the former case]; and you<br>\
may say صَادَ, because this is easier of pronunciation: some make it imperfectly decl., considering<br>\
it as fem. [and a proper name]: and some make it<br>\
perfectly decl., considering it as masc.; and say,<br>\
قَرَأْتُ صَادًا [I read, or recited, the chapter ص]:<br>\
and the like is done in the cases of ق [the title of<br>\
the fiftieth chapter] and ن [the title of the sixtyeighth chapter]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Accord. to ISd, its<br>\
medial radical letter is originally و: (L:) accord.<br>\
to IJ, it is ى. (MF.)<br>\
-A2-  See also art. صيد.<br>\
