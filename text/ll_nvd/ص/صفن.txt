صَافِنٌ A horse standing upon three legs and the<br>\
extremity of the hoof of the fourth leg: (A&#39;Obeyd, *<br>\
S, TA:) or standing upon three legs, and turning<br>\
back the extremity of the fore part of the fourth<br>\
hoof, that of his fore leg: (M, TA:) or standing<br>\
upon three legs, and otherwise: thus, says Fr, I<br>\
have found the Arabs use the word: (TA: [see<br>\
1, first sentence:]) pl. صُفُونٌ (M, TA) and صَوَافِنُ<br>\
and [the pl. of صَافِنَةٌ is] صَافِنَاتٌ. (TA.) صَافِنَاتٌ<br>\
occurs in the Kur xxxviii. 30. (M, TA.) And<br>\
in the same, xxii. 37, I&#39;Ab and Ibn-Mes-&#39;ood<br>\
used to read صَوَافِنَ [instead of صَوَافَّ]; the<br>\
former explaining it as meaning Having the shank<br>\
of one fore leg tied up to the arm; for thus is done<br>\
with the camel when he is slaughtered: the latter,<br>\
as meaning standing, or standing still. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And applied to a man, it means صَافٌّ قَدَمَيْهِ<br>\
[setting his feet evenly, side by side], (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
M, TA, and the like is said in the S and Msb,)<br>\
standing. (A&#39;Obeyd, Msb, TA.) It is said in a<br>\
trad., (S, M, Msb, TA,) referring to the Prophet<br>\
mentioned as praying, (S, M,) قُمْنَا خَلْفَهُ صُفُونًا<br>\
[app. meaning We stood behind him setting our<br>\
feet evenly, side by side; for so the context seems<br>\
to indicate]. (S, M, Msb, K.) [But] in another<br>\
trad., صَلٰوةُ الصَّافِنِ is said to be forbidden; meaning [The praying] of him who puts his feet close<br>\
together: or, as some say, of him who turns back<br>\
his foot [i. e. one of his feet] like as the horse turns<br>\
his hoof [i. e. one of his hoofs, when standing upon<br>\
three legs]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  الصَّافِنُ signifies [The saphena, or crural vein; so in the present day;<br>\
i. e.] the vein of the سَاق: (S: [see أَبْهَرُ, and see<br>\
also النَّسَا:]) or a vein lying deep in the arm<br>\
(الذِّرَاع) [and] amid the sinews of the [fore] shank<br>\
of a beast: or the صَافِنَانِ are two veins penetrating into the interior of the two shanks: or two<br>\
veins in the legs: or two branches [of veins] in<br>\
the two thighs: and the صافن is [strangely said<br>\
to be] a vein in the interior of the back bone, extending lengthwise, uniting with the نِيَاط [q. v.]<br>\
of the heart, also called the أَكْحَل. (M.)<br>\
