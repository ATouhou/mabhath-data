صَلَوْتُهُ, (K,) or صَلَوْتُ الظَّهْرَ, (M,) I struck,<br>\
or beat, that part, [of him, or] of the back, which<br>\
is called صَلًا: (M:) or I hit that part (M, K)<br>\
with a thing, or with an arrow or some other<br>\
thing: on the authority of Lh, who says that it is<br>\
of the dial. of Hudheyl: and one says also صَلَيْتُهُ;<br>\
which is extr. [with respect to derivation], unless<br>\
it be an instance of interchangeableness [of و and<br>\
ى]. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  صَلِيَتْ and صَلَتْ, said of a mare,<br>\
or she-camel: see 4.<br>\
2<br>\
صلّى, (S, M, K,) quasi-inf. n. صَلَاةٌ or صَلٰوة,<br>\
for which one should not say تَصْلِيَةٌ, (S, K,) or<br>\
the latter is allowable as agreeable with rule and<br>\
as occurring in old poetry, (MF, TA,) He prayed,<br>\
supplicated, or petitioned: (S, M, K:) and [particularly] he performed the divinely-appointed act<br>\
[of prayer commonly] termed صَلَاة or صَلٰوة. (S.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [ix. 104], (TA,) وَصَلِّ عَلَيْهِمْ<br>\
And pray thou for them. (Msb, TA.) صَلَّى عَلَى<br>\
فُلَانٍ means He prayed for such a one, and<br>\
praised him. (TA.) And hence the verse of ElAashà cited in art. رسم, conj. 8. (S, Mgh, * TA.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., مَنْ دُعِىَ إِلَى وَلِيمَةٍ فَلْيُجِبْ<br>\
وَإِلَّا فَلْيُصَلِّ [i. e. Whoso is invited to a banquet, or<br>\
a marriage-feast, let him comply, or, if not, let<br>\
him pray for the inviter]. (M.) And the saying,<br>\
in a verse of El-Aashà, عَلَيْكِ مِثْلَ الَّذِى صَلَّيْتِ<br>\
means Keep thou to the like of thy prayer; i. e.<br>\
he enjoined her to repeat the prayer for him: or,<br>\
as some relate it, عَلَيْكِ مِثْلُ الَّذِى صَلَّيْتِ, meaning<br>\
upon thee be the like of that for which thou hast<br>\
prayed: (M:) these words he addressed to his<br>\
daughter, on the occasion of her saying, “O my<br>\
Lord, ward off from my father diseases and pain. ”<br>\
(Mgh.) The saying عَبِيدُ فُلَانٍ يُصَلُّونَ [The slaves<br>\
of such a one perform the divinely-appointed act<br>\
of prayer] means that they have attained to the<br>\
age of virility. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  صلّى عَلَيْهِ, said of an<br>\
angel, means He prayed for, or begged, forgiveness, or pardon, for him: and thus the verb<br>\
sometimes means when said of other than an<br>\
angel; as in the trad. of Sowdeh, in which it is<br>\
said, إِذَا مِتْنَا صَلَّى لَنَا عُثْمَانُ بْنُ مَظْعُونٍ [When<br>\
we die, &#39;Othmán Ibn-Madh&#39;oon will pray for<br>\
forgiveness for us]; he having then died. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [And, said of a man, He blessed him, meaning<br>\
he invoked God&#39;s blessing upon him; namely, the<br>\
Prophet; or he said, اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَيْهِ (expl. by<br>\
what here follows) accord. to the rendering of<br>\
صَلُّوا عَلَيْهِ, i. e. عَلَى النَّبِىِّ, by Bd and others in<br>\
the Kur xxxiii. 56.] One says, صَلَّيْتُ عَلَى النَّبِىِّ<br>\
[I blessed the Prophet; &amp;c.]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And, said<br>\
of God, He blessed him, meaning He conferred<br>\
blessing upon him: and He had mercy on him:<br>\
and He magnified him, or conferred honour upon<br>\
him: hence the saying, اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى آلِ أَبِى أَوْفَى,<br>\
meaning O God, bless the family of Aboo-Owfà:<br>\
or have mercy on &amp;c.: but in the saying [in the<br>\
Kur xxxiii. 56], إِنَّ اللّٰهَ وَمَلَائِكَتَهُ يُصَلُّونَ عَلَى النَّبِىِّ,<br>\
the verb does not import two meanings; for it has<br>\
there only one meaning, which is “ magnification ”<br>\
[i. e. these words mean Verily God and his<br>\
angels magnify the Prophet; or rather I would<br>\
render them, bless the Prophet, as this rendering<br>\
implies magnification and also a meaning of the<br>\
quasi-inf. n. given in the M and K, which is<br>\
“ eulogy,” or “ commendation,” bestowed by<br>\
God upon his apostle, while it imports God&#39;s<br>\
“ conferring of blessing ” and the angels&#39; “ invoking thereof ” ]: (Msb, TA:) [it is said that]<br>\
اللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ means O God, magnify<br>\
Mohammad in the present world by exalting his<br>\
renown and manifesting his invitation [to ElIslám] and rendering permanent his law, and in<br>\
the world to come by accepting his intercession for<br>\
his people and multiplying his reward: and it is<br>\
disputed whether or not this form of prayer may<br>\
be used for any but the Prophet [Mohammad]:<br>\
El-Khattábee says that it may not, though he<br>\
himself used it for others. (TA.) [صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
وَسَلَّمَ is a phrase commonly used by the Muslims<br>\
after the mention of their prophet: see art. سلم.<br>\
See also صَلَاةٌ below.]<br>\
-A2-  صلّى said of a horse,<br>\
(S, K,) inf. n. تَصْلِيَةٌ, (TA,) He followed next<br>\
after the foremost [in a race, at the goal]. (S,<br>\
K.) Hence the saying [in a trad. of &#39;Alee], سَبَقَ<br>\
رَسُولُ اللّٰهِ وَصَلَّى أَبُو بَكْرٍ وَثَلَّثَ عُمَرُ [expl. in art.<br>\
سبق]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And صلّى الحِمَارُ أُتُنَهُ, (Sgh,<br>\
K,) inf. n. تَصْلِيَةٌ, (Sgh, TA,) The [wild] ass<br>\
drove together his she-asses, and made them to<br>\
take the way [that he would follow]. (Sgh, K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَصْلَتْ, (T, S, K, TA,) and ↓ صَلِيَتْ, (Fr, K,<br>\
TA,) and ↓ صَلَتْ, (Zj, TA,) said of a mare, The<br>\
parts on the right and left of her tail, (صَلَوَاهَا, S,)<br>\
or the part on either side of her tail, (صَلَاهَا, K,<br>\
[see صَلًا, below,]) became relaxed, she being near<br>\
to bringing forth: (S, K:) or, said of a she-camel, her young one fell into the part of her<br>\
called صَلًا, and she was near to bringing forth.<br>\
(T, TA.)<br>\
صَلًا The middle of the back of a human being<br>\
and of any quadruped: (M, K:) and, (K,) or as<br>\
some say, (M,) [app. in a beast,] the part that<br>\
slopes down from the hips, or haunches: or the<br>\
space intervening between the جَاعِرَة [app. meaning<br>\
the hinder projection of the haunch or rump of a<br>\
beast] and the tail: (M, K:) or the part on the<br>\
right and left of the tail; (S, M, K;) the two<br>\
together being called [the] صَلَوَانِ, (S, K,) which<br>\
is similarly expl. by Zj in relation to a she-camel;<br>\
app. properly meaning the two parts bordering<br>\
upon the tail-bone: (TA:) or the place in which<br>\
is set the tail of the horse; dual as above: (Msb:)<br>\
or the bone upon which are the two buttocks:<br>\
(Mgh: [there thus expl. in relation to a man:])<br>\
or the bone in which is the place of setting of the<br>\
tail-bone; thus expl. by IDrd: or the صَلَوَانِ are<br>\
the two bones projecting from the two sides of the<br>\
rump: or, accord. to some of the lexicologists,<br>\
two veins (عِرْقَانِ) in the place of the رِدْف [i. e. in<br>\
the rump]: (Ham p. 46:) the pl. is صَلَوَاتٌ, (M,<br>\
K,) an instance of a pl. formed by the addition of<br>\
ا and ت from a masc. sing., (M,) and أَصْلَآءٌ. (M,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, جِئْتُ فِى أَصْلَائِهِمْ,<br>\
meaning I came at their rears. (TA.)<br>\
صَلَاةٌ, or صَلٰوة, [accord. to El-Hareeree, to be<br>\
written with ا when prefixed to a pronoun, and<br>\
also in the dual number, (see De Sacy&#39;s Anthol.<br>\
Gram. Arabe, p. 67 of the Arabic text,) but this<br>\
rule I have not found to be generally observed,<br>\
even in the best MSS., nor have I in the similar<br>\
case of حَيٰوةٌ, (to which it is also applied,) in the best<br>\
copies of the Kur-án,] is said to be [originally<br>\
صَلَوَةٌ,] of the measure فَعَلَةٌ, (Mgh, MF, TA,) or,<br>\
accord. to some, [صَلْوَةٌ,] of the measure فَعْلَةٌ:<br>\
(MF, TA:) it is a quasi-inf. n. of صَلَّى [q. v.]:<br>\
(S, K:) and [used as a simple subst.] it signifies<br>\
Prayer, supplication, or petition: (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K:) this is said to be its primary signification:<br>\
and ↓ مُصَلًّى is said to have the same meaning.<br>\
(Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Then applied to signify A certain<br>\
well-known mode, or manner, [of religious service,]<br>\
because comprising prayer; (Msb;) [the divinelyappointed act of prayer;] one of the divinelyappointed صَلَوَات; (S;) a certain religious service<br>\
in which are رُكُوع [or lowering of the head so<br>\
that the palms of the hands reach the knees] and<br>\
سُجُود [or prostration of oneself in a particular<br>\
manner expl. voce سَجَدَ]: (M, * K:) and ↓ مُصَلًّى<br>\
is said to have the same meaning. (TA.) [The<br>\
performance of this act is fully described in my<br>\
work on the Modern Egyptians.] It is said to be,<br>\
in this sense, a proper term of the law, not indicated by the language of the Arabs [before<br>\
El-Islám] except as importing prayer, which is its<br>\
primary signification: what Esh-Shiháb says respecting it necessarily implies its being a proper<br>\
term of the law known to the Arabs [before ElIslám]: in the Mz it is said to be one of the words<br>\
of El-Islám: but all of these sayings require consideration. (MF, TA, [Much more, which I<br>\
omit as being unprofitable, is added on this point<br>\
in the TA, partly from the Msb; as well as<br>\
several different opinions respecting the derivation<br>\
of the word as used in this sense, which are fanciful<br>\
or absurd.]) The saying of the Prophet, لَا صَلٰوةَ<br>\
لِجَارِ المَسْجِدِ إِلَّا فِى المَسْجِدِ means There is no<br>\
صلوة [or divinely-appointed act of prayer] that<br>\
is excellent or complete [to the neighbour of the<br>\
mosque unless in the mosque]. (M.) And his<br>\
saying, to Usámeh, الصَّلٰوةُ أَمَامَكَ means The time<br>\
of the صلوة [or divinely-appointed prayer], or the<br>\
place thereof, [is before thee,] alluding to that of<br>\
sunset. (Mgh.) And he used the term الصَّلٰوةُ as<br>\
meaning سُورَةُ الصَّلٰوةِ, i. e. The فَاتِحَة [or Opening<br>\
Chapter of the Kur-án, because it is a form of<br>\
prayer, or] because the recital thereof is excellent,<br>\
or satisfactory. (Mgh.) In the Kur xxii. 41,<br>\
(I&#39; Ab, S, M, Ksh, Bd,) [the pl.] صَلَوَاتٌ means<br>\
Places of worship of the Jews: (I&#39; Ab, S, M,<br>\
Ksh, Bd, K:) said to be (Ksh, Bd) originally<br>\
صَلُوتَا, a Hebrew word, (Ksh, Bd, K,) arabicized:<br>\
(Ksh, Bd:) this is the common reading of the<br>\
word, and the most valid: other readings are<br>\
صُلُوَاتٌ and صُلَوَاتٌ and صِلَوَاتٌ; and beside these,<br>\
some others which are perverted forms. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also Prayer for forgiveness or pardon. (M,<br>\
Mgh, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And A blessing, as meaning an invocation of God&#39;s blessing upon any one. See 2.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And i. q. بَرَكَةٌ [as meaning A blessing, such<br>\
as is bestowed by God]: (Msb:) and mercy (S,<br>\
M, Mgh, Msb, K) of God (S, M) on his apostle:<br>\
(M:) and magnification; and this is [said to be]<br>\
specially denoted by its verb when the Prophet is<br>\
the object: (Msb:) and God&#39;s eulogy, or commendation, bestowed upon his apostle. (M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  الصَّلَاةُ [from صَلًا] also means إِتْيَانُ المَرْأَةِ فِى<br>\
دُبُرِهَا. (TA in art. صوم.)<br>\
مُصْلِيَةٌ part. n. of أَصْلَتْ [q. v.] said of a she-camel [or of a mare]. (T, TA.)<br>\
مُصَلًّى A place of الصَّلَاة [as meaning the performance of the divinely-appointed act of prayer];<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K;) or of any prayer or supplication: (Mgh:) [and particularly] a place of the<br>\
performance of the divinely-appointed prayer on<br>\
the occasion of the [festival termed] عِيد: (MA:)<br>\
[and also such a place at a burial-ground: the<br>\
place for this purpose is particularly termed<br>\
مُصَلَّى الأَمْوَاتِ: see De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe,<br>\
sec. ed., i. 192.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And A carpet upon which one<br>\
performs the divinely-appointed act of prayer.<br>\
(MA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also صَلَاةٌ, former half, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
مُصَلٍّ Any one praying [in any manner: and<br>\
particularly performing the divinely-appointed act<br>\
of prayer]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And المُصَلَِّى signifies, as<br>\
applied to a horse, The one that follows next after<br>\
the foremost [at the goal] (S, M, Mgh, Msb) in a<br>\
race: (Mgh, Msb:) because his head is next to<br>\
the part called صَلًا, (Lh, S, M, Msb,) or next to<br>\
the صَلَوَانِ, (Mgh,) of the foremost. (Lh, S, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
