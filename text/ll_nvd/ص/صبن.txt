[Thou hast turned away the cup of wine from us,<br>\

صَبْيَنَ or صَيْبَنَ: see what next precedes.<br>\
صَبْنَآءُ The hand of a player at a game of hazard<br>\
inclined for acting treacherously to a companion.<br>\
(IAar, K.)<br>\
صَابُونٌ a word of well-known meaning, (S, M,<br>\
K,) [Soap;] a compound with which clothes [&amp;c.]<br>\
are washed: the best of which is made of pure<br>\
olive-oil and clear potash and good جِير [meaning<br>\
lime], well cooked [i. e. boiled], and dried, and<br>\
cut into particular shapes: the مَغْرِبِىّ sort is not<br>\
cut, nor well cooked [or boiled], but is like cooked<br>\
starch: (TA:) it is hot and dry; and produces<br>\
a pleasurable sensation in the body; (K;) but the<br>\
washing the head with it hastens hoariness: (TA:<br>\
[in which many other supposed properties of it<br>\
are mentioned:]) IDrd says the word is not of the<br>\
language of the Arabs: (TA:) [Fei, in the Msb,<br>\
fancifully derives it from صَبَنَ الكَأْسَ, because it<br>\
removes filths and impurities:] MF says that it is<br>\
one of the words common to all languages, Arabic<br>\
and Persian and Turkish and others [as Greek<br>\
&amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] صُابُونُ الهُمُومِ is a term<br>\
for (assumed tropical:)  Wine. (TA voce تِرْيَاقٌ, q. v.)<br>\
[<br>\
صَابُونِىٌّ Of, or relating to, soap; saponaceous.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And A maker, or seller, of soap: mentioned<br>\
in the K and TA only as a surname.]<br>\
