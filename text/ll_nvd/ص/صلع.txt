middle of the head. (TA.) [See also ?? and<br>\
جَلَحٌ.] Accord. to Ibn-Seenà, the baldness termed<br>\
صَلَعٌ does not happen to women, because of the<br>\
abundance of their moisture; nor to eunuchs,<br>\
because their constitutions are nearly like those of<br>\
women. (Msb.) ―<br>\

eaten by the camels. (TA.) ―<br>\

-A3-  صَلَعَ said of such as is termed عِذْيَوْط, [but<br>\

K, TA,) and ↓ صَلَعَت [or more probably صَلِعَت].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اصطلع, accord. to Reiske, as stated by<br>\
Freytag, signifies He, or it, was defiled, or polluted; “ conspurcatus fuit: ” but he names no<br>\
authority.]<br>\
