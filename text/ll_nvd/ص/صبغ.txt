صَبُغَ and<br>\
صَبَغَ (S, O, Msb, K, the former<br>\
not in the copy of the K used by SM) and<br>\
صَبِغَ,<br>\
(Fr, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. صَبْغٌ (S, O, Msb, K)<br>\
and صِبَغٌ (As, O, K) and صِبَغَةٌ, (AHn, TA,) [of<br>\
which last, صِبْغَةٌ (q. v.), also said to be an inf. n.,<br>\
is perhaps a contraction, or, as is said in the Ksh<br>\
ii. 132, it means a mode, or manner, of صَبْغ,]<br>\
He dyed it, or coloured it; (K TA;) namely,<br>\
a garment, or piece of cloth; (S, O, Msb, TA;)<br>\
and white, or hoary, hair, and the like. (TA.)<br>\
[It is said that] the primary meaning of الصَّبْغُ<br>\
in the language of the Arabs is The altering<br>\
[a thing]: and hence صُبِغَ الثَّوْبُ, meaning The<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth, was altered in colour<br>\
to blackness or redness or yellowness [&amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] صَبَغَ اللُّقْمَةَ, aor.<br>\
صَبُغَ, inf. n.<br>\
صَبْغٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He moistened the mouthful with oil or<br>\
grease [or any kind of صِبْغ i. e. sauce &amp; c.]; and<br>\
he dipped it, or immersed it; and in like manner<br>\
any other thing. (TA.) [Thus] one says, صَبَغَ<br>\
يَدَهُ بِالمَآءِ (As, O, K) and فِى المَآءِ (TA) (tropical:)  He<br>\
dipped, or immersed, his hand, or arm, in the<br>\
water. (As, O, K, TA.) And صَبَغَتِ النَّاقَةُ<br>\
مَشَافِرَهَا فِى المَآءِ (As, O) or بِالمَآءِ (TA) (assumed tropical:)  The she-camel dipped her lips in the water. (As, O, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] the term صَبْغٌ is used by the<br>\
Christians as meaning (assumed tropical:)  The dipping, or immersing, of their children, [i. e. baptizing them,]<br>\
in water. (Az, S, * TA.) One says, صَبَغَ وَلَدَهُ<br>\

preceding sentence) and] صِبْغَةٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He introduced<br>\

baptism. (TA.) And صَبَغَ وَلَدَهُ فِى اليَهُودِيَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
introduced his child into the Jewish communion<br>\
[probably by baptism combined with circumcision:<br>\
but see صِبْغَةٌ, an explanation of which seems to<br>\

case]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And يَصْبُغُونَ الحَدِيثَ (assumed tropical:)  They<br>\

عِنْدَكَ mean They pointed me out to thee as one<br>\
who would accomplish what thou desiredst of me;<br>\
from the saying of the Arabs, صَبَغْتُ الرَّجُلَ بِعَيْنِى<br>\
and بِيَدِى I pointed at the man with my eye and<br>\
with my hand: (O, K: *) but Az says that this is<br>\
a mistake; that the Arabs when they mean thus<br>\
say صَبَعْتُ, with the unpointed ع. (O.) ―<br>\
-b6-  One<br>\

(O, TA.) And صَبَغَتْ فِيهَا رَأْسَهَا [or فِيهِ, She put<br>\
her head into it]; like صَبَأَتْ. (TA.)<br>\

(AZ, O, K.) And one says also, مَا أَخَذْتُهُ بِصِبْغِ<br>\
الثَّمَنِ, (AZ, O,) or مَا أَخَذَهُ بِصِبْغِ ثَمَنِهِ, (K,) i. e.<br>\

abundant upon the table.] (TA.) صِبْغٌ is used in<br>\

Hence, in the Kur [xxiii. 20], وَصِبْغٍ لِلْآكِلِينَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [And a sauce for those that eat]; (S, O, Msb,<br>\
TA;) where it means, accord. to Fr, olive-oil;<br>\

[ii. 132], (O, TA,) صِبْغَةَ اللّٰهِ means the religion<br>\
of God, syn. فِطْرَةَ اللّٰهِ, (O, Msb, K,) or دِينَ اللّٰهِ,<br>\
(S, Msb,) which is the meaning of فِطْرَةَ اللّٰهِ;<br>\
(Msb;) the religion of God, with an adaptation<br>\
to which mankind are created; because its effect<br>\
appears in him who has it like the dye in the garment; (Bd, Jel;) or because it intermingles in<br>\

it is said to be from the Christians&#39; صَبْغ [or صَبْغَة<br>\

that they have; (S; [and the like is said in the<br>\

the accus. case as an objective complement;<br>\
(Msb;) for the meaning is “ follow ye the religion<br>\
of God; ” (O, Msb;) or “ we will follow the<br>\

God has prescribed to Mohammad; i. e. circumcision: (O, K:) or صبغة is in this instance an<br>\
inf. n., (Ksh, Bd, Jel,) signifying a mode, or<br>\
manner of, صَبْغ [i. e. of baptism], (Ksh,) relating<br>\

corroborative of the saying آمَنَّا [in verse 130], as<br>\
such put in the accusative case, (Ksh, Bd, Jel,)<br>\
by reason of a verb understood, (Jel,) the meaning being صَبَغَنَا اللّٰهُ صِبْغَتَهُ [God hath baptized us<br>\
with his baptism]; (Ksh, Bd, Jel; *) [so that<br>\
صِبْغَةَ اللّٰهِ signifies the baptism of God, and may<br>\
here be rendered We have received the baptism<br>\
of God;;] the Muslims being hereby commanded<br>\
to say to the Christians, “Say ye, God hath baptized us (صَبَغَنَا) with the faith, with a baptism<br>\
(صَبْغَة) not like ours [i. e. not like our Christian<br>\
baptism], and purified us with a purifying not like<br>\
ours; ” or the Muslims being hereby commanded<br>\
to say [of themselves], “God hath baptized us<br>\
(صَبَغَنَا) with the faith, as a baptism (صِبْغَةً), and<br>\
we have not been baptized with your baptism<br>\

[Which may mean The most lying of men, or of<br>\
the most lying of men, are the dyers and the goldsmiths; or (assumed tropical:)  those who colour, and those who<br>\
transform, information, or discourse]: El-Khat-<br>\
tábee says, the meaning is, that the persons who<br>\
practise the two crafts to which these words relate<br>\
make many promises as to returning the goods,<br>\
and often break their promises; wherefore they<br>\
are said to be of the most lying of men; not that<br>\
every one of them is one who lies: but he adds<br>\

colouring of speech with falsehood. (O.)<br>\

ثُمَام [which is applied to several species of panic<br>\

three different explanations, here following:]<br>\
accord. to Aboo-Ziyád, a certain tree, or plant,<br>\
that grows in the sands, resembling the ضَعَة<br>\
[which is applied to a species of the ثُمَام], which<br>\
is one of the abodes of the gazelles in the hot season,<br>\
lurking-places being excavated by them at its<br>\
roots: accord. to another, of the Arabs of the<br>\
desert, it is like the ثُمَام, but the ضَعَة is larger in<br>\
the leaves, and of a brighter green: accord. to<br>\
Aboo-Nasr, a certain tree, or plant, having a<br>\
white fruit. (O.) And, (O, K,) as some say,<br>\

accord. to some authorities, be perfectly decl.]<br>\
مُصْبِغٌ [without ة] (tropical:)  A palm-tree (نَخْلَةٌ) showing<br>\

present day.]<br>\
مُصَبِّغٌ Dyed much. (O.) In the phrase ثِيَابٌ<br>\
مُصَبَّغَةٌ, [it is said that] the epithet is with teshdeed<br>\
لِلْكَثْرَةِ [which means to denote muchness, and also<br>\
to denote application to many objects, so that it<br>\
may be rendered either Garments much dyed, or<br>\
simply dyed garments]. (S.)<br>\
