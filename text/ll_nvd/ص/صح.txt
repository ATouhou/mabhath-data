mountain near to such rising ground, and not so<br>\
plain as what is termed صَحْرَآء. (L.) ―<br>\

be in health or sick: (L:) or having his cattle in<br>\
a healthy, or sound, state, after their having been<br>\
affected by a plague, or murrain, or distemper:<br>\
pl. مُصِحُّونَ. (S, L.) It is said in a trad., لَا<br>\
يُورِدَنَّ ذُو عَاهَةٍ عَلَى مُصِحٍّ (S, L) i. e. One whose<br>\
camels are affected by a murrain, or distemper,<br>\
shall by no means bring them to water immediately<br>\
after one whose camels are in a healthy, or sound,<br>\
state, so as to water the former beasts with the<br>\
latter: a prohibition apparently given for fear<br>\
that the latter beasts should become diseased like<br>\
the former, and it should be supposed that the<br>\
disease had passed by contagion, which ought not<br>\
to be imagined. (L. [See also مُمْرِضٌ.])<br>\
مَصَحَّةٌ A cause of one&#39;s being rendered healthy,<br>\

diseases; in which maladies are not common or<br>\
frequent. (TA.)<br>\

affection. (K.) And it is also said to signify<br>\
Counselling, or admonishing, or one who counsels<br>\
or admonishes, faithfully, or sincerely: so in a<br>\
verse of Meleeh El-Hudhalee; as though used by<br>\
poetic license for مُصَحِّحٌ. (L.)<br>\
-A2-  And (tropical:)  One<br>\
who does, or says, vain, or false, things. (A, K.)<br>\
