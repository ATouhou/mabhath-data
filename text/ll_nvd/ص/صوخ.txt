اصاخ لَهُ (S, A, K, TA) and إِلَيْهِ, (A, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. إِصَاخَةٌ, (TA,) He listened to him, or it.<br>\
(S, K, TA.) [See a verse of Aboo-Du-ád (cited<br>\
here as an ex. in the S and TA) voce نَاشِدٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And اصاخ signifies also (tropical:)  He was silent, or<br>\
spake not, or ceased from speaking: so in the<br>\
saying, أَصَاخَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى حَقِّ فُلَانٍ, meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  Such a one was silent respecting the right, or<br>\
due, of such a one, that he might take it away.<br>\
(A, TA.) [And it is said that] it signifies thus in<br>\
the prov., أَصَاخَ إِصَاخَةَ المِنْدَهِ لِلنَّاشِدِ, i. e. He was<br>\
silent with the silence of the frequent chider of<br>\
camels [or of him who drives and chides many<br>\
camels] to one making known, or giving information of, a thing lost: applied to him who strives,<br>\
or labours, in seeking [a thing] and then lacks<br>\
ability, and desists. (Meyd. [But the verse cited<br>\
voce نَاشِدٌ suggests another rendering, which I<br>\
think preferable. In Freytag&#39;s “ Arab. Prov. ”<br>\
i. 718, للناشد is omitted.])<br>\
