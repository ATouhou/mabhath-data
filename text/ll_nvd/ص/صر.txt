(S, M, A, K:) or very intensely cold: (T in explanation of the latter:) or vehemently loud: (M,<br>\

a man and of a bird &amp;c. (Zj, M.) [In the K,<br>\

-b2-<br>\
And Vehemence of grief or anxiety (S, M, K) and<br>\
of war (M, K) and of heat, (K,) or of the hot<br>\

See also مُصَرَّاةٌ.<br>\
صُرَّةٌ A purse (شَرَجٌ, M, K, in the CK شَرْجٌ,)<br>\
for money; (S, M, A, Msb, K;) as also ↓ مَصَرٌّ,<br>\
with fet-h, (TA,) or ↓ مِصَرٌّ: (so in a copy of the<br>\
A:) pl. of the first, صُرَزٌ. (Msb.) Hence the<br>\
prov., اِفْتَحْ صُرَرَكَ تَعْلَمْ عُجَرَكَ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Return<br>\
to thyself, [or lay open the recesses of thy mind,]<br>\
and thou wilt know [thy vices, or faults, or] thy<br>\
good from thy evil. (Meyd. [See also صُرَدٌ, last<br>\

sentence.]<br>\
صَرَارٌ: see صَرُورَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
صِرَارٌ The thing with which a she-camel&#39;s udder<br>\
is bound: (M, K:) the string which is tied over<br>\
the she-camel&#39;s udder and over the [piece of wood<br>\
called] تَوْدِيَة, in order that her young one may<br>\
not suck her; (S;) and in order that it may not<br>\

(TA:) or a piece of rag which is bound upon the<br>\
she-camel&#39;s teats, in order that her young one may<br>\
not such her: (Msb:) pl. أَصِرَّةٌ. (M, A, K.) It<br>\
is a custom of the Arabs to bind the صرار upon<br>\
the udders of their milch camels when they send<br>\
them to pasture by themselves; and when they<br>\
return in the evening, they loose the اصرّة, and<br>\
milk. (IAth.) ―<br>\

صَرَارَةٌ: see the next paragraph, in three places.<br>\
صَرُورَةٌ (S, M, A, Msb, K) and ↓ صَارُورَةٌ (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K) and ↓ صَرُورٌ and ↓ صَارُورٌ (M, K) and<br>\
↓ صَرَارَةٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ صَرُورِىٌّ (S, M, Msb, K)<br>\
and ↓ صَارُورِىٌّ (M) or ↓ صَارُورَآءُ, (Sgh, K,) the last<br>\
like عَاشُورَآءُ, mentioned on the authority of Ks,<br>\
(TA,) A man who has not performed the pilgrimage to Mekkeh: (S, M, A, Msb, K:) so called<br>\
from صَرٌّ, signifying the “ act of confining, withholding, hindering, or preventing; ” (TA;) or<br>\
because the person so called refrains from expending of his property in pilgrimage: (Msb:) you<br>\
say also, اِمْرَأَةٌ صَرُورَةٌ a woman who has not performed the pilgrimage to Mekkeh: (S, Msb:)<br>\
pl. ↓ صَرَارٌ and ↓ صَرَارَةٌ: (K:) [or, rather, the<br>\
former is a coll. gen. n., of which صَرَارَةٌ is the n.<br>\
of un.; and the latter is a quasi-pl. n., like صَحَابَةٌ,<br>\
as well as n. un. of صَرَارٌ:] Fr cites, from certain<br>\
of the Arabs, ↓ صَرَارٌ as used collectively; and one<br>\
of the number is termed ↓ صَرَارَةٌ: (S:) each of the<br>\
forms ending with the relative ى receives the<br>\
dual and pl. and fem. inflections: and accord. to<br>\
IAar, the forms preceding those receive also the<br>\
dual and pl. inflections: (M, * TA:) and some say<br>\
that صَوَارِيرُ is pl. of ↓ صَارُورَةٌ: (TA:) or ↓ صَارُورَةٌ<br>\
and ↓ صَارُورٌ, (M,) or صَرُورَةٌ, (Lh, S, M, A, Msb,)<br>\
as occurring in the poetry of En-Nábighah,<br>\
(Yaakoob, S,) not used without ة, (Lh, M,) or all<br>\
the sing. forms above mentioned, (K,) signify one<br>\
who has not married: (M, A, K:) or who has not<br>\
had intercourse with women: as though he had<br>\
determined (أَصَرَّ) upon relinquishing them:<br>\
(Yaakoob, S, Msb: *) applied in like manner to a<br>\
woman, and to a plurality of persons: (M, K:)<br>\
the ة in صَرُورَةٌ applied to a man and to a woman<br>\
is not to denote the fem. gender, but to give the<br>\
utmost intensiveness to the signification. (IJ,<br>\
M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in a trad., لَا صَرُورَةَ فِى الإِسْلَامِ,<br>\
(S, M,) meaning, accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, There is<br>\
no abstinence from intercourse with women in<br>\
El-Islám: (M, TA:) i. e., no one should say, I<br>\
will not marry: (TA:) thus he makes صرورة a<br>\
noun signifying an accident: but it is better known<br>\
as an epithet: (M:) and IAth says that the meaning is, he who slays another in the حَرَم [or sacred<br>\
territory of Mekkeh] shall be slain: his saying,<br>\
“ I am a صرورة; I have not performed the pilgrimage, and I know not the sacredness of the<br>\
حَرَم; ” shall not be accepted of him: for in the<br>\
Time of Ignorance, the Kaabeh was a place of<br>\
refuge. (TA.)<br>\
دَرَاهِمُ صَرِيرَةٌ i. q. مَصْرُورَةٌ [i. e. Dirhems, or<br>\
pieces of money, tied up in a purse]: (K:) termed<br>\
in the present day ↓ صَرٌّ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
صَارَّةٌ.<br>\
صَرَارِىٌّ A sailor: (S, M, K:) like صَارٍ: (S:)<br>\
pl. صَرَارِيُّونَ: (S, M, K:) it has no broken pl.:<br>\
(M:) or صَرّارِىّ should be [without tenween, imperfectly decl., and] mentioned in art. صرى; for<br>\
it is pl. of صُرَّآءٌ, which is pl. of صَارٍ, which J has<br>\
mentioned in art. صرى: AHát used to say that<br>\
صُرَّآءٌ is a sing., like حُسَّانٌ; but without sufficient<br>\
authority: and J has regarded صَرَارِىّ as a sing.<br>\
in consequence of his finding it to have the same<br>\
construction as a sing, in verses of Arabs;<br>\
whence he imagined the ى in it to be the relative<br>\
ى, as is shown by his mentioning the word in this<br>\
place. (IB.)<br>\
صَرُورِىٌّ: see صَرُورَةٌ.<br>\
صُرَّى: see صِرَّى:<br>\
-A2-  and see also art. صرى.<br>\
صُرِّى: see the next paragraph.<br>\
هِىَ مِنِّى صِرَّى, said of an oath, (S,) or هُوَ مِنِّى,<br>\
صِرَّى, (M, K,) and ↓ أَصِرَّى, and ↓ صِرِّى, and<br>\
↓ أَصِرِّى, (Yaakoob, S, M, K,) and ↓ صُرَّى and<br>\
↓ صُرِّى, (K, TA,) or ↓ صُرِّىٌّ and ↓ صِرِّىٌّ, (as in a<br>\
copy of the M,) It is a determination, or resolution,<br>\
from me; (S, M, K;) a serious assertion; not a<br>\
jest. (S, K.) Aboo-Semmál El-Asadee, his<br>\
she-camel having strayed, said, “I swear to<br>\
Thee, [O God,] that, if Thou restore her not<br>\
to me, I will not serve Thee: ” (S:) or, “O<br>\
God, if Thou restore her not to me, I will not<br>\
say a prayer to Thee: ” (TA:) and he found<br>\
her, her nose-rein having caught to a thorntree (عَوْسَجَة); and he took her, and said, عَلِمَ<br>\
رَبِّى أَنَّهَا مِنِّى صِرَّى My Lord knew that it was a<br>\
determination, or resolution, or serious assertion,<br>\
from me: (S:) or a confirmed determination:<br>\
(ISk:) it is derived from أَصْرَرْتُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ “ I<br>\
persevered, or persisted, in the thing: ” (S:) [or<br>\
“ I determined, or resolved, upon the thing: ”]<br>\
AHeyth says, ↓ صِرِّى, i. e., Determine thou, or<br>\
resolve thou; as though he addressed himself;<br>\
from أَصَرَّ عَلَى فِعْلِهِ “ he determined, or resolved,<br>\
upon going on in doing it, and not turning back: ”<br>\
it is also said that ↓ أَصِرّى is changed into ↓ أَصِرَّى,<br>\
like as they say بِأَبِى أَنْتَ and بِأَبَا أَنْتَ: and in<br>\
like manner, ↓ صِرِّى is changed into صِرَّى; the<br>\
ا in أَصِرِّى being elided: not that they are two<br>\
dial. vars., صَرَرْتُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ and أَصْرَرْتُ: and Fr.<br>\
says that صِرَّى and ↓ أَصِرَّى are originally imperatives; and that, when they desired to change<br>\
them [i. e. the imperatives] into nouns, they<br>\
changed the ى into | [written ى after fet-h]: and<br>\
in like manner, [changing verbs into nouns,] they<br>\
say, نُهِىَ عَنْ قِيلٍ وَقَالٍ; &amp;c. (TA.) Accord. to<br>\
AZ, one says, ↓ إِنَّهَا مِنِّى لَأَصِرَّى meaning Verily,<br>\
it is a truth, or reality, from me; and Aboo-Málik says the same of ↓ أَصِرِّى. (TA.)<br>\
صِرِّى: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
صَرِّىٌّ and ↓ صِرّىٌّ A dirhem, (S, M, A, K,)<br>\

copies of the last of which, in the place of إِذَا<br>\
نُقِرَ, is put اذا نُقِدَ: TA:) accord. to some, used<br>\
only in negative phrases: (IAar, M:) thus used<br>\
in the phrase, مَا لِفُلَانٍ صَرِّىٌّ, [expl. as] meaning<br>\
Such a one has not a dirhem nor a deenár:<br>\

it a dual nor a pl. (TA.)<br>\
