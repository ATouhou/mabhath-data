صَأَى, (S, M, K,) aor. يَصْئِى, (M,) like<br>\
صَعَى aor. يَصْعِى, (S, [in one of my copies of the<br>\
S يَصْعَى, which is wrong, or, accord. to the TA,<br>\
both are correct, and in the K the pret. is said to<br>\
be like سَعَى, which implies that the aor. is like<br>\
يَسْعَى,]) inf. n. صَئِىٌّ (S, M, K) and صِئِىٌّ (Ks,<br>\
M, K, TA) and صُئِىٌّ, (Ks, K, TA,) said of a<br>\

↓ تَصَآءَى: (M, K:) and accord. to Fr, one says<br>\
also of the scorpion, تَصِىْءُ and تَصْئِى. (S.) It<br>\
is said in a prov., تَلْدَغُ العَقْرَبُ وَتَصْئِى or وَتَصِىْءُ,<br>\
(As, S, Meyd,) this latter verb being formed by<br>\
transposition, (Meyd,) i. e. The scorpion stings<br>\
while uttering a cry; (S, Meyd;) the و being a<br>\
denotative of state: (As, S:) applied to him who<br>\
does wrong in the guise of him who complains of<br>\
wrongdoing. (Meyd.) And one says also, جَآءَ<br>\
بِمَا صَأَى وَصَمَتَ, (S, K,) and بِمَا صَآءَ وَصَمَتَ<br>\
(IAar, S, TA,) صَآءَ being formed by tranposition<br>\
from صَأَى, (S,) He brought what was vocal and<br>\
what was mute; (S, K;) such as slaves and beasts,<br>\
and clothes and silver; (As, TA;) or sheep or<br>\
goats, and camels, and gold and silver; (IAar,<br>\
TA;) meaning he brought much property: and<br>\
this is likewise a prov. (S.)<br>\

called because of her cry. (TA.)<br>\
