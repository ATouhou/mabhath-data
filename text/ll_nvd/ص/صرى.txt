صَرِىَ, (S, M, Msb,) aor.<br>\
صَرَىَ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
صَرًى, (M, Msb,) said of water, It remained, or<br>\
stagnated, long: or it remained long, and became<br>\
altered [for the worse]: (S, Msb:) or, said of<br>\
water and of milk, it remained so that its flavour<br>\
became altered [for the worse]: (M:) or, said of<br>\
milk, it remained undrawn from the udder, so<br>\
that its flavour became bad, or corrupt. (TA.)<br>\
And صَرِىَ الدَّمْعُ The tears collected [in the eye]<br>\
and did not run. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] صَرِيَتِ النَّاقَةُ,<br>\
(Fr, M, Msb, TA,) aor. as above, (Msb,) and so<br>\
the inf. n.; (M, Msb, TA;) but Ibn-Buzurj says<br>\
صَرَت, aor.<br>\
صَرِىَ; (TA;) The she-camel&#39;s milk became<br>\
collected in her udder; (M, Msb, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ أَصْرَت. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And صَرِىَ فِى يَدِهِ, (S,<br>\
M, IKtt, TA,) with kesr; (S, TA;) or صَرَى فِى<br>\
يَدِهِ;) (thus accord. to the K;) He (a man) remained in his hand, as a pledge, (S, M, K, TA,)<br>\

اِنْقَطَعَ [It, or he, became cut off, cut short, or<br>\

senses of the latter]: from IAar. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  صَرَاهُ,<br>\
(IKtt, Msb, TA,) aor.<br>\
صَرِىَ, (Msb,) inf. n. صَرْىٌ,<br>\
(IKtt, Msb, TA,) He confined it, namely, water,<br>\
in a resting-place or a vessel; and in like manner,<br>\
milk, and tears: (IKtt, TA:) or he collected it,<br>\
namely, water, and it remained long and became<br>\
altered [for the worse], or remained or stagnated<br>\
long; and in like manner, but in an intensive<br>\
sense, ↓ صرّاهُ. (Msb.) One says also of cows<br>\
[and the like], تَصْرِى اللَّبَنَ فِى ضُرُوعِهِنَّ They<br>\
confine and collect the milk in their udders.<br>\
(TA.) And [of a man] one says, صَرَى المَآءَ<br>\
فِى ظَهْرِهِ زَمَانًا He retained the ماء [i. e. sperma]<br>\
in his back a long time, (S, M, K, *) by abstaining<br>\
from sexual intercourse. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
صَرَيْتُهَا, (M, Msb,) aor.<br>\
صَرِىَ, inf. n. صَرْىٌ; (Msb;)<br>\
and ↓ صَرَّيْتُهَا, (S, M, Msb,) inf. n. تَصْرِيَةٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) but the latter verb has an intensive meaning; (Msb;) and ↓ أَصْرَيْتُهَا; (M;) namely, a<br>\
ewe or she-goat, (S,) or a she-camel, (M, Msb,)<br>\
and any other milch animal, (M,) I caused the<br>\
milk to collect in her udder, (S, M, Msb,) by<br>\
abstaining from milking her for some days. (S,<br>\
M.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, i. e. صَرَاهُ, (M, K,) aor.<br>\
صَرِىَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. صَرْىٌ, (M,) i. q. قَطَعَهُ [He cut it off, cut<br>\
it short, or stopped it; &amp;c.]; (M, K;) namely, a<br>\
thing. (M.) You say, صَرَى بَوْلَهُ, inf. n. as above,<br>\
meaning قَطَعَهُ [He, or it, cut short, or stopped,<br>\
his urine]. (S.) And صَرَيْتُ المَآءَ [app. I cut<br>\
short, or stopped, the drawing of the water; for it<br>\
is expl. as said] إِذَا اسْتَقَيْتَ ثُمَّ قَطَعْتَ. (S.) And<br>\
مَا يَصْرِيكَ مِنِّى أَىْ عَبْدِى, occurring in a trad.,<br>\
means What cuts short (يَقْطَعُ) thine asking of<br>\
Me [O my servant]? (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. دَفَعَهُ<br>\
[He repelled it]. (M, K.) One says, صَرَى اللّٰهُ<br>\
عَنْهُ شَرَّهُ i. e. دَفَعَ [God repelled, or may God<br>\
repel, from him his, or its, evil, or mischief].<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And i. q. مَنَعَهُ [He prevented it, &amp;c.].<br>\
(S, M, K.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says,<br>\
وَوَدَّعْنَ مُشْتَاقًا أَصَبْنَ فُؤَادَهُ<br>\
هَوَاهُنَّ إِنْ لَمْ يَصْرِهِ اللّٰهُ قَاتِلُهْ<br>\
[And they bade farewell to one affected with<br>\
desire, whose heart they had smitten; the love of<br>\
them, if God had not prevented it, had been his<br>\
slayer]. (S. [But this verse may be well rendered as an ex. of صَرَاهُ in the sense next following,<br>\
which is also a meaning of مَنَعَهُ: in the M, it is<br>\
cited as an ex. of صَرَاهُ in the sense of دَفَعَهُ.]) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
Said of God, (M,) He protected, defended,<br>\
guarded, or preserved, him: (M, K:) or (M) He<br>\
saved him (M, K) from destruction, or perdition:<br>\

the case between them]; (S, K;) namely, persons<br>\
who had applied to him as a judge: (S:) or he<br>\
rectified, or adjusted, the case between them.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
-A4-  صَرَى also signifies عَطَفَ [He bent, or<br>\
inclined]: (K, TA:) [app. intrans., or trans. by<br>\
means of بِ, for] a poet uses the phrase صَرَيْنَ<br>\
بِالأَعْنَاقِ [They bent, or inclined, with the necks].<br>\
(TA.) [But it is said in the TK that صَرَاهُ means<br>\
عَطَفَهُ He bent, or inclined, it.] Accord. to Ibn-Buzurj, صَرَتِ النَّاقَةُ عُنُقَهَا means The she-camel<br>\
raised her neck by reason of the heaviness of the<br>\
burden. (TA.)<br>\
-A5-  Also He preceded, or went<br>\
before; syn. تَقَدَّمَ. (IAar, K.) [Accord. to the<br>\
TK, one says صَرَى القَوْمَ, meaning تَقَدَّمَهُمْ He<br>\
preceded, or went before, the people, or party.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And [the contr., i. e.] He receded, or retreated; or became, or remained, or lagged,<br>\

also signifies He sold a ewe or she-goat, (K, TA,)<br>\
or a she-camel, (TA,) whose milk had been caused<br>\
to collect in her udder in consequence of her not<br>\
having been milked for some days; such as is<br>\
termed مُصَرَّاةٌ. (K, TA.)<br>\

اِصْدَرَاهُ i. q. اِزْدَرَاهُ [the د in each being substituted for ت]: see the latter, in art. زرى.<br>\
صَرًى, (S, M, Msb, K,) an inf. n. used as an<br>\
epithet, (Msb,) and ↓ صِرًى, (S, M, K,) [and<br>\
Freytag adds ↓ صُرًى, as from the K, in which I<br>\

as an epithet, (TA,) Milk that has remained (M,<br>\
K) long (K) so that its flavour has become<br>\

which is in like manner applied to water: (M:)<br>\
or milk left [long] in the udder of the camel, not<br>\
drawn, so that it becomes salt and windy: (IAar,<br>\
TA:) or milk drawn in the night from a camel<br>\
abounding therewith, having a bad and burning<br>\
flavour. (Az, TA.) And, (M, K,) some say,<br>\
(M,) [used as a subst.,] A portion remaining<br>\
(M, K) of milk (M) in the udder, (Ham p. 661,)<br>\
and of water. (TA.) And Tears (دَمْعٌ) that<br>\
have become collected: and the sing. [or epithet<br>\
applied to a single tear (دَمْعَةٌ)] is صَرَاةٌ. (M.)<br>\
And نُطْفَةٌ صَرَاةٌ [Sperma of a man] altered [for<br>\
the worse]: and long retained by him in his back.<br>\
(M. [This is also mentioned in the S, app. in the<br>\
latter of these senses; the meaning being there<br>\
only indicated by the context.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  For the fem.,<br>\
صَرَاةٌ, see also مُصَرَّاةٌ.<br>\
صُرًى: see صَرًى, first sentence: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see<br>\

صرًى: see صَرًى, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  In relation<br>\
to a she-camel it is Her being pregnant twelve<br>\
months, and bringing forth, and then yielding her<br>\
biestings, or having her biestings milked: mentioned by Az. (TA. [But what is meant by this<br>\
is, to me, doubtful; for sometimes an inf. n., and<br>\
sometimes and epithet, and sometimes a subst., is<br>\
expl. in this manner.])<br>\
صَرٍِ [part. n. of صَرِىَ]: see صَرًى. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
she-camel whose milk has collected in her udder.<br>\
(Msb.) [See also مُصَرَّاةٌ.]<br>\
صَرْيَةٌ Milk collected [in the udder]: a poet says,<br>\
وَكُلُّ ذِى صَرْيَةٍ لَا بُدَّ مَحْلُوبُ<br>\
[And whatever udder has milk must be milked].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
صَرْيَآءُ: see مُصَرَّاةٌ.<br>\

fet-h and medd,]) when they become yellow; (S,<br>\
M;) as also صَرَايَاتٌ: (so in one of my copies of<br>\
the S [in which it is shown to be correct by an<br>\
ex. in a verse of Suleyk there cited: in the M and<br>\
TA صَرَايَا, which I think a mistranscription]: in<br>\
the other of my copies of the S omitted:) one<br>\
thereof is termed ↓ صَرَايَةٌ. (S, M, K. *) [In the<br>\
M and K, صَرَآءٌ is termed pl. of صَرَايَةٌ; but it is<br>\
properly speaking a coll. gen. n., originally صَرَاىٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  ↓ صَرَايَةٌ also signifies The water in which<br>\
colocynths have been steeped. (M, K.)<br>\
صَرِىٌّ One who acts with boldness towards the<br>\

صَرَارِىٌّ in art. صر.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also [said to signify] The<br>\
transverse piece of wood in the middle of the ship:<br>\
(M, K:) [but] IAth says that it is the دَقَل [i. e.<br>\
mast] of the ship, which is set up in the middle<br>\
thereof, and upon which is the شِرَاع [or sail: it<br>\
is now commonly called ↓ صَارِيَةٌ and سَارِيَةٌ: both<br>\
of which are also sometimes applied to a column]:<br>\
pl. صَوَارٍ. (TA.)<br>\
صَارِيَةٌ A well (رَكِيَّةٌ) of which the water is old,<br>\

caused to collect in her udder by her not having<br>\
been milked for some days; (S, K;) as also<br>\
↓ صُرَّى, like رُبَّى; (so in copies of the K; [but<br>\
this, if correct, should be mentioned in art. صر,<br>\
in which the former is also mentioned; accord. to<br>\
the TA, however, it seems to be ↓ صُرًى, without<br>\
teshdeed, for it is there said to be like رُبى;]) both<br>\
likewise applied to a she-camel, and to a cow;<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ صَرَاةٌ signifies the same, (K,) applied<br>\
to a she-camel and to a ewe or she-goat; (TA;)<br>\
and so, applied to a she-camel, ↓ صَرْيَآءُ, of which<br>\
the pl. is صَرَايَا, (M, K,) an irreg. pl. (M.) [See<br>\
also صَرٍ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Aboo-&#39;Alee, in the Bári&#39;, makes it<br>\
syn. with مَصْرُورَةٌ; and so says the Imám EshSháfi&#39;ee; as though originally مُصَرَّرَةٌ: but Suh,<br>\
in the R, disallows this. (TA.)<br>\
