[And thou becomest, or wilt become, red by reason<br>\
of the saying that I have published, like as the<br>\
fore part of the spear becomes red from blood],<br>\
(S, * M,) he has made صدر fem. because the صدر<br>\
of the قناة is a part of the قناة; for they [sometimes] make a noun fem. when it is prefixed to a<br>\
fem. noun: (S:) or if you will, you may say that<br>\
he has made صدر fem. because he meant [thereby]<br>\
the قناة; and if you will, you may say that the<br>\
صدر of a قناة is a قناة. (M.) [Hence,] بَنَاتُ<br>\

the derivatives of verbs: (Lth, TA:) [in this sense<br>\
it is a conventional term of grammar and lexicology, not belonging to the classical language;<br>\
but on account of the importance of understanding<br>\
its true application in lexicology, it is necessary<br>\
to give here a full explanation of it: it is, agreeably with its etymology, the source (lit. place) of<br>\
derivation, accord. to the grammarians of ElBasrah; and is what I term an infinitive noun:<br>\
it is defined as] a noun signifying, by its original<br>\
application, an accident as subsisting in, or proceeding from, an agent (as الفَرَحُ [“ the being<br>\
joyful ”], الضَّرْبُ [“ the act of beating ”], and<br>\
القُعُودُ [“ the act of sitting ”]), or affecting an<br>\
object of action, (as الجُنُونُ [“ the being possessed by a jinnee ”]), conformable to its verb, so<br>\
as to comprise all the letters in that verb, either<br>\
literally (as in the instances above) or virtually<br>\
(as in القِتَالُ [“ the act of fighting ”], which wants<br>\
the ا that is before the ت in the verb, yet wants<br>\
it as to the letter only, and not virtually, wherefore<br>\
it is sometimes pronounced as if with the said<br>\
letter, as in قَاتَلَ قِيتَالًا, but the ا is changed into<br>\
ى on account of the kesr of the letter before it),<br>\
or substituting another letter for any of those<br>\
letters that it wants (as in العِدَةُ [“ the act of<br>\
promising ”], which wants the و that is in its<br>\
verb as to the letter and virtually, but has ة substituted for it [by way of compensation]): (from<br>\
a comparison of definitions &amp;c. in the Expos. of<br>\
the “ Kitab Hodood en-Nahw ” by the author of<br>\
the work thus entitled, arts. مصدر and اسم مصدر;<br>\
the Expos. of the “ Shudhoor edh-Dhahab ” by<br>\
the author of the work thus entitled, section on<br>\
the nouns that govern as verbs; I&#39; Ak; &amp;c.:)<br>\
but the grammarians of El-Koofeh hold that the<br>\
verb is the root, and that the مصدر is derived<br>\
from it: (I&#39; Ak p. 148:) some مصادر, moreover,<br>\
are derived from real (as opposed to ideal) substantives, as التَّحَجُّرُ [“ the becoming stone ”]<br>\
from الحَجَرُ [“ stone ”]. (Kull p. 327.) The<br>\
مصدر has the same government as its own verb:<br>\
it is often, and may be at pleasure, used as an<br>\
ideal subst. or abstract noun: and it is often<br>\
employed in the place of an act. or a pass. part. n.:<br>\
(Kull, &amp;c.:) [when thus used as an epithet, it is<br>\
employed alike as sing. and pl. and masc. and<br>\
fem.:] accord. to Zj, every مصدر used as an<br>\
epithet is for ذُو [or ذَات &amp;c.] followed by the<br>\
مصدر, and therefore it has no dual nor pl. [nor<br>\
fem.] form. (TA voce حَرَضٌ.) [It has also other<br>\
uses, which are expl. in the grammars. Used as<br>\
a مَصْدَر, it is sometimes made fem.; as it is also<br>\
when used in the sense of a noun that is properly<br>\
fem.: see صَرْفٌ, third sentence.] ―<br>\
-b4-  اِسْمُ مَصْدَرٍ,<br>\
called by some اِسْمٌ لِلْمَصْدَرِ, is a term applied to<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  A quasi-infinitive noun; i. e.] a noun which is<br>\
not a مصدر, but which is occasionally used in the<br>\
place of a مصدر; like as a مصدر is used in the<br>\
place of an act. part. n., and in that of a pass.<br>\
part. n.: such as الوُضُوْءُ for التَّوَضُّؤُ [“ the performing of the ablution preparatory to prayer ”],<br>\
and الغُسْلُ for الاِغْتِسَالُ [“ the washing of oneself ”]; each of which wants somewhat that is in<br>\
its verb without substituting anything for that<br>\
which is wanting. (Expos. of the “ Kitáb el-<br>\
Hodood,” cited above.) This kind of noun the<br>\
grammarians of El-Koofeh and Baghdád allow<br>\
to govern as a مصدر; but the grammarians of ElBasrah hold that the noun governed in the accus.<br>\
case in each of the exs. adduced by the former as<br>\
confirmatory of their opinion is so governed by a<br>\
verb understood. (Expos. of the “ Shudhoor,”<br>\
ubi suprà.) It is also applied to A proper name<br>\
signifying an accident [or attribute]; as فَجَارِ<br>\
and حَمَادِ, proper names, by original application,<br>\
for الفَجْرَةُ and المَحْمَدَةُ [“ vice ” and “ praise ”]<br>\
and the like: and this kind does not govern as a<br>\
مصدر. (Expos. of the “ Kitáb Hodood enNahw,” ubi suprà; and Expos. of the “ Shudhoor,” ubi suprà.) It is also applied to [what is<br>\
more properly termed اِسْمٌ لِلْمَعْنَى الحَاصِلِ بِالمَصْدَرِ,<br>\
by some termed simply حَاصِلٌ بِالمَصْدَرِ, i. e. An<br>\
ideal substantive, or abstract noun;] a noun<br>\
applied to signify an accident [or attribute] considered abstractedly [such as صَدَرٌ signifying<br>\
“ return; ” and this kind is commonly termed in<br>\
the lexicons simply an اِسْم as distinguished from<br>\
a مصدر]. (Kull p. 327.) Some apply it also to<br>\
what is [properly] termed مَصْدَرٌ مِيمِىٌّ [i. e. A<br>\
مصدر commencing with an augmentative م], if<br>\
not of the measure مُفَاعَلَةٌ: but such is really a<br>\
مَصْدَر. (Expos. of the “ Shudhoor,” ubi suprà.)<br>\
And some of the grammarians [and of the lexicographers likewise] apply it to A noun that<br>\
signifies the instrument [or means] with [or by]<br>\
which the action signified by a مصدر is performed: as الأُكْلُ [“ food,” as being “ that by<br>\
means of which the act of eating (الأَكْلُ) is performed ”]. (Kull, ubi suprà.) ―<br>\
