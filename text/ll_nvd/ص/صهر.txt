And A relation, or kinsman, or kinswoman, of a<br>\

حَمٌ &amp;c. (see art. حمو)]: (Kh, As, ISk, Msb:)<br>\
and the father or brother or other kinsman of a<br>\
man&#39;s wife: (Kh, As, ISk, S, Msb, K:) so accord.<br>\
to some of the Arabs: (Kh, As, S, Msb:) or none<br>\
says otherwise, accord. to As, and IAar says the<br>\
like: (Mgh:) or any relation of a man&#39;s wife or<br>\
of a woman&#39;s husband whom it is unlawful to<br>\
marry; as the father, and brother, and son, and<br>\

or a man&#39;s relation by marriage: and a kinsman<br>\
of a man&#39;s relation by marriage: (A:) or a man<br>\
who has married among a people: (Lth, Mgh:)<br>\
and the husband of a man&#39;s daughter: and the<br>\
husband of a man&#39;s sister: (IAar, K:) Fr says<br>\
that, in the Kur xxv. 56, it signifies, a relation<br>\
whom it is lawful to marry; as the daughter of a<br>\
paternal uncle, and of a maternal uncle, and the<br>\
like: and نَسَب in the same, a relation whom it is<br>\
unlawful to marry: Zj, that the former signifies a<br>\
relation whom it is unlawful to marry: and the<br>\
latter, such as is not a صِهْر, of those mentioned in<br>\
the Kur [iv. 27], from the words “ your mothers<br>\
are forbidden unto you ” to the words “ and your<br>\
combining [as your wives] two sisters: ” I&#39;Ab<br>\
explains نسب and صهر in the former passage of<br>\
the Kur differently from Fr [altogether], and<br>\
differently in part from Zj; saying that the former<br>\
applies to the seven relations first mentioned in<br>\
iv. 27 in the Kur, and صهر to the remaining six<br>\
there mentioned and that mentioned in the next<br>\
preceding verse; [so that it includes a man&#39;s<br>\
foster-mother, who has suckled him; his fostersister, who has been suckled with him; his wife&#39;s<br>\
mother; his step-daughter under his guardianship, born of his wife unto whom he has gone in;<br>\
his son&#39;s wife; his wife&#39;s sister combined with that<br>\
wife; and his father&#39;s wife;] and this, says Az,<br>\
is correct: (Mgh:) in the Kur xxv. 56, it means<br>\
ذُو صِهْرٍ, whether male or female: (Jel:) or ذَوَاتُ<br>\
صِهْرٍ: (Bd:) pl. أَصْهَارٌ (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and<br>\
صُهْرَآءُ; (K;) which latter is extr. (TA.) [صِهْرَةٌ,<br>\
applied to a female, pl. ضِهَرَاتٌ, is app. postclassical.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A grave, or sepulchre: (ISd,<br>\
K:) for they used to bury their daughters alive,<br>\
and say, “We have married them to the grave: ”<br>\
then, in the time of El-Islám, this expression was<br>\
used, and it was said, نِعْمَ الصِّهْرُ القَبْرُ [An excel-lent son-in-law is the grave]: or it means, correctly, that which supplies the place of the صهر.<br>\
(ISd.)<br>\
صِهْرِىٌّ i. q. صِهْرِيجٌ [q. v.]; (K;) a dial. var. of<br>\
the latter word; signifying A thing like a حَوْض<br>\
[or watering-trough, or tank]: (S:) accord. to Az,<br>\
a construction of clay and stones, built between<br>\
[and across] two narrow branches (مَأْزِمَانِ) of a<br>\
small water-course (شُعْبَة) of a valley, so that the<br>\
water is kept back thereby, and they drink from<br>\
it a long time. (TA.)<br>\
صَهُورٌ A melter of fat: and a roaster, broiler, or<br>\
frier: pl. صُهْرٌ. (K.)<br>\
صَهِيرٌ [i. q. ↓ مَصْهُورٌ as meaning] Melted, or<br>\
liquefied. (S, K.) [And used also as a subst., in<br>\
the sense of صُهَارَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Bread seasoned with<br>\
صُهَارَة; and so ↓ مَصْهُورٌ. (A, O, TA.)<br>\
صُهَارَةٌ What is melted (As, K, TA) of fat, (As,<br>\
TA,) and the like: (TA:) or (TA, in the K<br>\
“ and ”) any piece of fat, (K, TA,) whether small<br>\
or large: (TA:) and (tropical:)  marrow; syn. نِقْىٌ and<br>\
مُخٌّ; (K, TA;) which mean the same. (TA.)<br>\
One says, مَا بِالبَعِيرِ صُهَارَةٌ (tropical:)  There is not in the<br>\
camel any fatness (طِرْقٌ); (ISk, S;) or any marrow. (TA.)<br>\
صُهُورَةٌ: see صِهْرٌ, first sentence.<br>\
صَاهُورٌ The sheath of the moon. (K. [See what<br>\
is meant thereby voce سَاهُورٌ; of which it is a dial.<br>\
var. in this sense, and app. in other senses also.])<br>\
صَيْهُورٌ A thing (A, O, K, TA) like a منْبَر [or<br>\
pulpit], of clay, (K, TA,) or of wood, (TA,) for<br>\
the household utensils of brass (A, O, K, TA) and<br>\
the like, (O, K,) which are put thereon: (A, O:)<br>\
but ISd says that it is not of established authority.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
