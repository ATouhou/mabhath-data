صَنَعَ الشَّىْءَ, aor.<br>\
صَنَعَ, inf. n. صُنْعٌ and صَنْعٌ,<br>\
He made, wrought, manufactured, fabricated, or<br>\
constructed, the thing; syn. عَمِلَهُ: (K:) [or he<br>\
made it, &amp;c., skilfully, or well; for] الصُّنْعُ signifies إِجَادَةُ الفِعْلِ; and every صُنْع is a فِعْل, but<br>\
every فِعْل is not a صُنْع; and it is not predicated<br>\
of [irrational] animals [unless tropically, (see<br>\
أَصْنَعُ,)] nor of inanimate things, like as الفِعْلُ is.<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] صَنَعَ signifies also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [He fabricated speech or a saying or sentence<br>\
or the like:] he forged a word; and poetry, عَلَى<br>\
فُلَانٍ in the name of such a one. (Mz, 8th نوع.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And صَنَعَ, inf. n. صَنْعٌ [and صُنْعٌ] and صَنِيعٌ,<br>\
[with the objective complement understood,] He<br>\
worked, or wrought; he practised, or exercised,<br>\
an art, a craft, or a manufacture. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And صَنَعَ إِلَيْهِ مَعْرُوفًا, (S, O, K,) aor. as above,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. صُنْعٌ, with damm, He did to him a<br>\
benefit, favour, or kind act: and صَنَعَ بِهِ صَنِيعًا<br>\
قَبِيحًا he did to him an evil, or a foul, deed: syn.<br>\
فَعَلَهُ: (S, O, K:) and one says also [in the former<br>\
of these two senses], عِنْدَهُ صَنِيعَةً ↓ اِصْطَنَعَ; (S,<br>\
Mgh, K;) syn. اِتَّخَذَهَا; (K;) or أَحْسَنَ إِلَيْهِ.<br>\
(Mgh.) The saying مَا صَنَعْتَ وَأَبَاكَ means مَعَ<br>\
أَبِيكَ [i. e. What didst thou together with thy<br>\
father?]. (S.) The saying of the Prophet,<br>\
إِذَا لَمْ تَسْتَحْىِ فَاصْنَعْ مَا شِئْتَ [If thou be not<br>\
ashamed, do what thou wilt,] is said to be an<br>\
instance of an imperative phrase of which the<br>\
meaning is predicative; i. e. it is as though he<br>\
said, he who is not ashamed does what he will:<br>\
(O, L, TA: *) and other explanations of it are<br>\
mentioned in the O and L: (TA:) [but] this is<br>\
held by A &#39;Obeyd to be the right meaning. (L.)<br>\
In the phrase صُنْعَ اللّٰهِ, in the Kur [xxvii. 90,<br>\
which may be rendered By the doing of God],<br>\
صنع is in the accus. case as an inf. n.: but one<br>\
may read it in the nom. case, meaning ذٰلِكَ to be<br>\
understood before it. (Zj, O, TA.) One says also,<br>\
مَا أَحْسَنَ صُنْعَ اللّٰهِ عِنْدَكَ and صَنِيعَ اللّٰهِ [How good<br>\
is the doing of God with thee, or at thine abode!].<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And صَنَعْتُ فَرَسِى, inf. n. صَنْعٌ and صَنْعَةٌ,<br>\
(tropical:)  I tended well my horse; or took good care of<br>\
him; (S, O, K, TA;) supplied him with fodder,<br>\
and fattened him: and صَنَعَ جَارِيَتَهُ (tropical:)  he reared,<br>\
or nourished, his girl, or young woman: (TA:)<br>\
and صُنِعَتِ الجَارِيَةُ (tropical:)  the girl, or young woman,<br>\
was treated [or nourished] well, so that she became<br>\
fat; as also ↓ صُنِّعَت, inf. n. تَصْنِيعٌ: (K, TA:)<br>\
or you say اِصْنَعِ الفَرَسَ, (so accord. to my MS.<br>\
copy of the K,) or الفَرَسَ ↓ أَصْنَعَ, (so accord. to<br>\
other copies of the K, and in the O, [in the CK<br>\
اُصْنِعَ الفَرَسُ,]) without teshdeed; [which seems to<br>\
indicate that the right reading is صَنَعَ, agreeably<br>\
with the reading in my MS. copy of the K which<br>\
gives the imperative form; though it is stated in<br>\
the TA that أَصْنَعَ الفَرَسَ is said by IKtt to be a<br>\
dial. var. of صَنَعَهُ;] (O, K;) and الجَارِيَةَ ↓ صَنَّعَ,<br>\
with teshdeed, meaning he treated [or nourished]<br>\
well the girl, or young woman, and fattened her;<br>\
(O, K; [in my MS. copy of the K صَنِّعِ الجَارِيَةَ;])<br>\
because the تصنيع of the girl, or young woman,<br>\
is by means of many things, and by careful<br>\
tending: (O, K:) so says Lth: (O:) but Az says<br>\
that by other, or others, than Lth, it is allowed to<br>\
say صَنَعَ جَارِيَتَهُ, without teshdeed: and hence the<br>\
phrase in the Kur [xx. 40.], وَلِتُصْنَعَ عَلَى عَيْنِى,<br>\
(TA,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  [And this I did] that thou<br>\
mightest be reared and nourished in my sight;<br>\
(O, TA;) for which some read وَلِْتُصْنَعْ, as an<br>\
imperative; and some, وَلِتَصْنَعَ, meaning and that<br>\
thou mightest work in my sight, (Ksh, Bd,) lest<br>\
thou shouldst do so contrary to my command.<br>\
(Bd.) You say likewise, of a woman, صَنَعَتْ نَفْسَهَا:<br>\
see 5. And you say also ↓ اِصْطَنَعْتُهُ, meaning (tropical:)  I<br>\
reared him; and educated, disciplined, or trained,<br>\
him well. (S, * O, K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Accord. to IDrst,<br>\
صَنِعَ, inf. n. صَنَعٌ, signifies He was, or became,<br>\
skilled, or skilful: but IB says that صَنِعَ has not<br>\
been heard. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
صَنَّعَ see 1, latter half, in two places.<br>\
3<br>\
مُصَانَعَةٌ primarily signifies The doing to one<br>\
a thing in order that he may do another thing to<br>\
the doer of the former thing. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
(TA,) (assumed tropical:)  The treating with gentleness, or blandishment; soothing, coaxing, wheedling, or cajoling;<br>\
and endeavouring to conciliate. (O, K, TA.) Or<br>\
this is from the last of the following significations.<br>\
(TA.) You say صانعهُ (assumed tropical:)  He treated him with<br>\
gentleness, or blandishment; &amp;c. (O, TA.) And<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He acted hypocritically with him. (TA.) And<br>\
صانعهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ (assumed tropical:)  He strove, or endeavoured, to<br>\
turn him from the thing by deceit, or guile.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, (A, TA,) or from the last<br>\
signification in this paragraph, (TA,) (tropical:)  The act of<br>\
bribing. (S, O, Msb, * K, * TA.) One says, صانع<br>\
الوَالِىَ (tropical:)  He bribed [the prefect, ruler, judge, or the<br>\
like]. (TA.) And صانعهُ بِالمَالِ (tropical:)  He bribed him<br>\
with property, wealth, or money. (Mgh, TA. *)<br>\
And it is said in a prov., مَنْ صَانَعَ بِالمَالِ لَمْ<br>\
يَحْتَشِمْ مِنْ طَلَبِ الحَاجَةِ (tropical:)  [He who bribes with<br>\
property is not ashamed of demanding the thing<br>\
wanted]. (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (tropical:)  A horse&#39;s not<br>\
putting forth, or giving, the whole of his strength<br>\
in going; reserving somewhat thereof: one says,<br>\
يُصَانِعُكَ بِبَذْلِهِ سَيْرَهُ (tropical:)  [He keeps back from thee<br>\
somewhat by the manner in which he exerts his<br>\
power of going]. (O, K, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اصنع He (a man, O) aided, or assisted,<br>\
another. (O, K.) And accord. to Ibn-&#39;Abbád,<br>\
followed in the O and TS and K, one says also,<br>\
اصنع الأَخْرَقُ, meaning The unskilful learned, and<br>\
did soundly, thoroughly, skilfully, or well: but<br>\
this is a mistake, occasioned by his deeming<br>\
dubious, or obscure, a passage in the Nawádir of<br>\
IAar, where the latter says that اصنع الرَّجُلُ<br>\
means أَعَانَ الأَخْرَقَ [i. e. The man aided, or<br>\
assisted, the unskilful]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اصنع الفَرَسَ:<br>\
see 1, latter half. [Freytag states, as on the<br>\
authority of the K, that أَصْنَعَ, said of a horse,<br>\
signifies “ Non omnibus viribus usus cucurrit, sed<br>\
ita tamen ut eques eo contentus esset ” (which is<br>\
nearly the same as a signification of صَانَعَ likewise<br>\
mentioned by him): but this is a mistake.]<br>\
5<br>\
تَصَنُّعٌ signifies The affecting a goodly way,<br>\
mode, or manner, of acting, or conduct, or the<br>\
like; (S, O, K, TA; [الصَّمْت in the CK is a mistranscription for السَّمْت;]) and the making a show<br>\
thereof; (TA;) and the adorning oneself (K, TA)<br>\
thereby, while internally unsound in the grounds<br>\
of pretension to respect. (TA.) And تصنّعت,<br>\
said of a woman, means نَفْسَهَا ↓ صَنَعَتْ [She cultivated and improved her person, so as to render<br>\
herself comely, by art, and good nurture]: (S,<br>\
O:) or she adorned, or embellished, herself.<br>\
(PS.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِصْتَنَعَ see 1, former half. ―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to Er-Rághib,<br>\
اِصْطِنَاعٌ signifies The exceeding the usual, or<br>\
ordinary, bounds, or degree, in putting a thing<br>\
into a good, sound, right, or proper, state.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, he says, the phrase in the<br>\
Kur [xx. 43], وَاصْطَنَعْتُكَ لِنَفْسِى, which means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  And I have chosen thee [for myself] to establish my evidence and to serve as my spokesman<br>\
between me and my creatures so that thy doing<br>\
thus shall be as though I did it: (TA:) or it<br>\
means I have reared thee, (Az, TA,) or I have<br>\
chosen thee, (O, K, TA,) [for myself,] for a<br>\
special affair which I require thee to accomplish<br>\
in a sufficient manner, (Az, O, K, TA,) concerning Pharaoh and his forces. (Az, TA.) See<br>\
also 1, last sentence but one. ―<br>\
-b4-  One says also,<br>\
اصطنع خَاتَمًا He ordered that a signet-ring<br>\
should be made for him. (O, K.) [See also 10.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And اصطنعهُ [in which the pronoun seems to<br>\
refer to رِزْق i. e. sustenance, &amp;c.,] also signifies<br>\
قَدَّمَهُ [app. meaning He offered it]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
And اصطنع [alone, for اصطنع مَصْنَعَةً,] (tropical:)  He<br>\
made, or prepared, a repast, feast, or banquet,<br>\
to which to invite friends. (O, K, TA.) And<br>\
(tropical:)  He prepared food to be dispensed in the way, or<br>\
cause, of God. (O and TA, from a trad.; mentioned also in the CK, but not in other copies of<br>\
the K.)<br>\
10<br>\
استصنعهُ, accord. to the O, signifies He<br>\
asked for it to be made for him: accord. to the L,<br>\
استصنع الشَّىْءَ signifies he invited, or he induced,<br>\
or caused (دَعَا,) [another] to make the thing.<br>\
(TA.) In the saying of Es-Sarakhsee, اِسْتَصْنَعَ<br>\
عِنْدَ الرَّجُلِ قَلَنْسُوَةً [app. meaning He asked, or<br>\
desired, the man to make for him a قلنسوة (q. v.)],<br>\
عند is redundant. (Mgh.) [See also 8.]<br>\
صَنْعٌ: see صَنَعٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also, and<br>\
↓ صَوْنَعٌ, A certain small creeping thing, or insect,<br>\
(دُوَيْبَّةٌ,) or a flying thing (طَائِرٌ): (K, TA:) mentioned by Sgh: (TA:) also written in the K (in<br>\
art. ضتع) ضَتْعٌ and ضَوْتَعٌ: in one case or the<br>\
other mistranscribed. (TA in art. ضتع.)<br>\
صُنْعٌ an inf. n. of صَنَعَ [q. v.] (S, K, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And i. q. رِزْقٌ [Sustenance, &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also صَنَعٌ, in two places.<br>\
صِنْعٌ A tailor: (O, K:) or one who is gentle,<br>\
delicate, or skilful, (رَفِيق, O,) or thin, fine, or<br>\
delicate, (رَقِيق, so in the copies of the K,) or<br>\
slender, or small, (دَقِيق, so in the TA,) [of which<br>\
readings that in the O is app. the right,] in<br>\
respect of the hands. (O, K.) See also صَنَعٌ, in<br>\
five places.<br>\
-A2-  Also A ↓ مَصْنَعَة of water; (O,<br>\
K, TA;) i. e. a piece of wood [app. a plank or<br>\
board] by means of which water is confined, and<br>\
retained for a while: (TA:) pl. أَصْنَاعٌ: (O, K:)<br>\
[but this explanation in the TA seems to have<br>\
been founded upon a statement there made, that<br>\
Az heard the Arabs call أَحْبَاس of water أَصْنَاع;<br>\
(see حِبْسٌ, of which احباس is the pl.;) for I do<br>\
not find ↓ مَصْنَعَةٌ thus expl. in any lexicon except<br>\
the TA:] and ↓ صَنَّاعَةٌ, with teshdeed, and ↓ صَنَاعٌ,<br>\
(O, K,) like سَحَابٌ, (K,) accord. to Lth, (O,)<br>\
signify pieces of wood [or planks or boards] put<br>\
together in water, to confine the water, and retain<br>\
it for a while; (O, K;) like the حِبَاسَة [q. v.].<br>\
(O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also مَصْنَعَةٌ, in two senses. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
A manufactured thing (K, TA) of any kind,<br>\
(TA,) such as a سُفْرَة [q. v.], (K, TA,) &amp;c.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  A garment. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K,<br>\
TA.) You say, رَأَيْتُ عَلَيْهِ صِنْعًا جَيِّدًا (tropical:)  [I saw<br>\
upon him a goodly garment]. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (tropical:)  A turban. (IAar, O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
And The [iron instrument with which flesh-meat<br>\
is roasted, called] سَفُّود. (O, TS, K.) El-Marrár<br>\
El-Fak&#39;asee says, describing camels,<br>\
وَجَآءَتْ وَرُكْبَانُهَا كَالشُّرُوبِ<br>\
وَسَائِقُهَا مِثْلُ صِنْعِ الشِّوَآء<br>\
[And they came, their riders being like drinkers,<br>\
or drunkards, and their driver like the سَفُّود of<br>\
roasted flesh-meat]. (O.) In the L, السود is put<br>\
in the place of السفّود; and after citing the verse<br>\
above, [and app. reading مِثْلَ, regarding it as<br>\
relating to the camels,] the author says that the<br>\
poet means, سُودَ الأَلْوَانِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And Roasted<br>\
flesh-meat [itself]; syn. شِوَآءٌ. (So in copies of<br>\
the K. [SM says that the right reading, as the<br>\
explanation of الصِّنْعُ in this instance, is الشَّوَا; and<br>\
cites IAar as saying الصِّنْعُ الشَّوَا نَفْسُهُ: but I<br>\
think that the right reading is indicated by the<br>\
addition نَفْسُهُ to be الشِّوَآءُ; and that IAar gives<br>\
this signification after mentioning that which here<br>\
next precedes it.])<br>\
رَجُلٌ صَنَعٌ, (Mgh, L, Msb,) and رَجُلٌ صَنَعُ اليَدَيْنِ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) and صَنَعُ اليَدِ, (Th, TA,)<br>\
and اليَدَيْنِ ↓ صِنْعُ, (S, O, K,) and اليَدِ ↓ صِنْعُ,<br>\
(TA,) and اليَدِ ↓ صُنْعُ, (IB, TA,) and Sh is<br>\

and اليَدَيْنِ ↓ صَنَاعُ, (K,) and اليَدِ ↓ صَنَاعُ, but<br>\
not صَنَاعٌ alone when applied to a male, (TA,) A<br>\
man skilful in the work of the hands or hand:<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, TA:) and a company of<br>\
men you term الأَيْدِى ↓ قَوْمٌ صُنْعَى and ↓ صُنُعَى<br>\
الأَيْدِى, and الأَيْدِى ↓ صَنَعَى, and الأَيْدِى ↓ صِنْعَى,<br>\
(K,) [all of which are instances of quasi-pl. ns.,<br>\
except, perhaps, the last, which is said in the TA<br>\
to be a pl. of ↓ صِنْع,] and أَصْنَاعُ الأَيْدِى, (K, [in<br>\
the CK, erroneously, اَصْنَاعِى,]) which is pl. of<br>\
اليَدِ ↓ صِنْعُ or of اليَدِ ↓ صَنِيعُ, or, accord. to Sh,<br>\
as IB says, the only pl. of ↓ صِنْعٌ is صِنْعُونَ, and<br>\
in like manner in the case of ↓ صُنْع you say صُنْعُو<br>\
اليَدِ, (TA,) and رِجَالٌ صُنُعٌ is mentioned as on the<br>\
authority of Sb, (K,) and Sh is related to have<br>\
said قَوْمٌ صَنْعُونَ, [using the latter word as pl. of<br>\
↓ صَنْعٌ,] with the ن quiescent. (TA.) And you<br>\
say ↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ صَنَاعٌ, (ISk, Mgh, Msb, TA,) and<br>\
اليَدَيْنِ ↓ صَنَاعُ, (S, O, K,) and اليَدِ ↓ صَنَاعُ, (IJ,<br>\
TA,) an instance of an epithet applied to a<br>\
woman like كَعَابٌ and رَدَاحٌ and حَصَانٌ, (TA,)<br>\
the ا of prolongation before the final letter resembling, and rendering needless, the ة in صَنَعَةٌ,<br>\
(IJ, TA,) which is not allowable, (IJ, * Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA, *) though an instance of it occurs used<br>\
on the ground of analogy: (Mgh:) A woman<br>\
skilful in the work of the hands or hand; (ISk,<br>\
S, O, K, TA;) who makes things in a suitable<br>\
manner; who sews, and cuts out or makes, leathern<br>\
buckets; (ISk, TA;) contr. of خَرْقَآءُ; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) and ↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ صَنِيعَةٌ signifies the same:<br>\
(TA:) and اِمْرَأَتَانِ صَنَاعَانِ: and نِسْوَةٌ صُنُعٌ. (S,<br>\
O, K.) Th preferred صَنَعُ اليَدِ as applied to a<br>\
man; and اليَدِ ↓ صَنَاعُ as applied to a woman.<br>\
(IB, TA.) Accord. to IDrst, صَنَعٌ is an inf. n.<br>\
used as an epithet. (TA. [But see 1, last sentence.]) It is said in a prov., ثَلَّةً ↓ لَا تَعْدَمُ صَنَاعٌ<br>\
[expl. in art. ثل]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says<br>\
of a poet, and of any one who is eloquent, رَجُلٌ<br>\
صَنَعُ الِلّسَانِ (tropical:)  [A man skilful in the use of the<br>\
tongue]: and in like manner, لِسَانٌ صَنَعٌ (tropical:)  [a<br>\
skilful tongue]. (K, TA.) And اللِّسَانِ ↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ صَنَاعُ<br>\

whence] one says, صِنَاعَتُهُ رِعَايَةُ الإِبِلِ [His habitual<br>\
work or occupation, or his business, is the tending,<br>\

or صَنْعَةٌ [more particularly] signifies the work of<br>\
the صَانِع; (S, O, K;) [a manufacture, or work of<br>\
art; and workmanship, or the skill of a worker,<br>\
which last meaning is plainly indicated in the O,<br>\

[i. e. craft, or habitual work or occupation,] of<br>\
the صَانِع, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, * K,) meaning of<br>\
him who works with his hand: (Mgh:) the pl. of<br>\
↓ صِنَاعَةٌ is [صَنَائِعُ and] صِنَاعَاتٌ. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is<br>\
also an inf. n. of 1 as used in the phrase صَنَعْتُ<br>\
فَرَسِى [q. v.]. (S, O, K, TA.)<br>\
أَسْهُمٌ صُنْعَةٌ, with damm, Arrows that are equal,<br>\
equable, uniform, or even, the work of one man.<br>\
(TA.) [Perhaps صُنْعَةٌ is a quasi-pl. n. of صَنِيعٌ<br>\
applied to an arrow.]<br>\
صُنْعَى and صِنْعَى and صَنَعَى and صُنْعَى: see<br>\
صَنَعٌ.<br>\
صَنَاعٌ: see صِنْعٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and see also صَنَعٌ, in eight<br>\
places.<br>\
صُنُوعٌ in a sense in which it is used in a verse<br>\
of Aboo-Dhu-eyb is a pl. of which ISd says, “I<br>\
know not any sing. thereof: ” accord. to Skr, it<br>\
means The خُرَز [app. either the seams or the<br>\
stitch-holes] of a مَزَادَة or of an إِدَاوَة: or, as some<br>\
say, the thongs used in the sewing thereof: and<br>\
some say the making thereof, so that in this case<br>\
it is an inf. n. (TA.)<br>\
صَنِيعٌ an inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
i. q. ↓ مَصْنُوعٌ [meaning Made, wrought, manufactured, fabricated, or constructed: or made, &amp;c.,<br>\

was at the repast of such a one, made, or prepared, by him, to which people were invited:<br>\
and ↓ المَصْنَعَةِ (tropical:)  the repast to which friends were<br>\
invited. (TA.) And (i. e. the former word) (tropical:)  Food<br>\
prepared to be dispensed in the way, or cause, of<br>\
God. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, applied to a sword, Polished,<br>\
(S, O, K, TA,) and proved by experience; and so<br>\
applied to an arrow: (K, TA:) or, applied to a<br>\
sword, frequently renovated by polishing: (A,<br>\
TA:) pl. صُنُعٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And, applied to a<br>\
horse, (tropical:)  Well tended; (S, O, K, TA;) supplied<br>\

manner it is applied to a human being:] one says,<br>\
