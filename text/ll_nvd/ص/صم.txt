صّمَّ, (S, M, Msb, K,) and صَمِمَ, which is<br>\
extr., (M, K,) [first pers. of each صَمِمْتُ,] aor.<br>\
يَصَمُّ, (M, Msb, K,) inf. n. صَمَمٌ (S, * M, Msb, K)<br>\
and صَمٌّ; (M, K;) and ↓ أَصَمَّ; (S, M, Msb, K;)<br>\
He was, or became, deaf; (M, * Msb, K; *) [or]<br>\
he had a stoppage of the ear, and a heaviness of<br>\
hearing. (M, K.) And صَمَّتِ الأُذُنُ, aor. as<br>\
above, inf. n. صَمَمٌ, The ear was, or became, deaf.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And He was, or became, as though<br>\
he heard not.] One says, صَمَّ عَنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  [He was as<br>\
though he heard not him, or it; he was deaf to<br>\
him, or it]; (M;) and عَنْهُ ↓ أَصَمَّ [meaning the<br>\
same]. (S, M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence صَمَّ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
or it, uttered, or made, no sound or noise; like<br>\
him who, not hearing, returns no reply to a call<br>\
or question; (assumed tropical:)  was dumb, or mute.] One says,<br>\
صَمَّتْ حَصَاةٌ بِدَمٍ (tropical:)  [A pebble made no sound in<br>\
falling upon the ground by reason of blood]; i. e.<br>\
the blood was so copious that if one threw a pebble<br>\
into it no sound would be heard in consequence<br>\
thereof, (As, S, M, Meyd, K, TA,) because it<br>\
would not fall upon the ground: (As, S, Meyd:)<br>\
the saying is a prov. (Meyd.) And hence the<br>\
saying of Imra-el-Keys, صمِّى ابْنَةَ الجَبَلِ, (S, K,)<br>\
in the following verse:<br>\
بُدِّلْتُ مِنْ وَائِلٍ وَكِنْدَةَ عَدْ<br>\
وَانَ وَفَهْمًا صَمِّى ابْنَةَ الجَبَلِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [I have been given in exchange, for Wáïl and<br>\
Kindeh,&#39; Adwán and Fahm: make no sound, O pebble: app. meaning that he would shed much blood]:<br>\
(S, TA: but this verse is omitted in one of my<br>\
two copies of the S:) or the meaning is, O echo;<br>\
(S, M, Meyd, K;) so they assert: (AHeyth,<br>\
TA:) or O calamity; the saying being a prov.;<br>\
(Meyd, TA;) applied to the case of a severe<br>\
calamity; as though meaning be dumb, O calamity; said by As to be applied in relation to an<br>\
event deemed excessively foul or evil: (TA:) or<br>\
O serpent; (Meyd, TA;) which is said to be the<br>\
primary meaning: (Meyd:) or O rock. (A Heyth,<br>\
K, TA. [See also the second of the sentences<br>\
here following.]) One says also, صَمَّ صَدَاهُ (tropical:)  [His<br>\
echo became dumb, or may his echo become<br>\
dumb;] meaning he perished, or may he perish.<br>\
(S, K, TA.) And ↓ صَمِّى صَمَامِ [in the CK erroneously written صُمِّى] meaning (tropical:)  Increase, O<br>\
calamity: (S, K, TA:) or it is applied to a man<br>\
who brings to pass a calamity, and means be<br>\
dumb, O calamity: (TA:) or صَمَامِ means calamity, and war; but primarily, the serpent; and<br>\
this saying, like صَمِّى ابْنَةَ الجَبَلِ, is a prov. said<br>\
when two parties refuse to make peace, and persist in opposition; meaning answer not the charmer,<br>\
O serpent, but continue as thou art wont to be.<br>\
(Meyd.) ―<br>\
-b4-  صَمَمٌ in relation to stones, (Lth, TA,)<br>\
or stone, (M,) [app. as an inf. n.,] signifies The<br>\
being hard [and solid (see أَصَمُّ)]; or [as a simple<br>\
subst.] hardness [and solidity]: (Lth, M, TA:)<br>\
and in relation to a spear-shaft, the being compact; or compactness. (M.) One says, صَمَّ<br>\
الحَجَرُ, inf. n. صَمَمٌ, The stone was hard [and<br>\
solid]. (MA.) And صَمَّتِ الفِتْنَةُ, meaning [The<br>\
trial, or civil war, &amp;c.,] was, or became, hard,<br>\
vehement, or severe. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  صَمَّ القَارُورَةَ, (S,<br>\
K,) or صَمٌّ رَأْسَ القَارُورَةِ, (M,) aor.<br>\
صَمُ3َ, (PS, [in a<br>\
copy of the M<br>\
صَمِ3َ, contr. to a general rule in the<br>\
case of a trans. verb of this class, and app. a<br>\
mistranscription,]) inf. n. صَمٌّ, (M,) He stopped<br>\
the flask or bottle [app. with a صَمَام]: (S, K:)<br>\
or he stopped the head of the flask or bottle, and<br>\
bound it; as also ↓ اصمّهُ: (K:) or اصمّ القَارُورَةَ<br>\
signifies he put a صِمَام to the flask or bottle. (S,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And صَمَّ الجُرْحَ, aor.<br>\
صَمُ3َ, inf. n. صَمٌّ, He<br>\
bound the wound, and put upon it a bandage with<br>\
medicament. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And صَمَّهُ, (S, M, K)<br>\
inf. n. صَمٌّ, (M,) He struck him, (S, K,) or it,<br>\
i. e. his head, (M,) with a staff, or stick, (S, M,)<br>\
and with a stone, (S, M, K,) and with the like<br>\
thereof. (M.) And صُمَّ, with damm, He was<br>\
struck vehemently. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
صمّم, said of a sword, (S, M, K, TA,) accord. to the K, signifies It struck the joint, and<br>\
cut, or severed, it: or i. q. طَبَّقَ: but this is at<br>\
variance with what is said by J and other leading<br>\
authorities; which is as follows: (TA:) it penetrated into the bone, and cut, or severed, it; but<br>\
when it strikes the joint, and cuts, or severs, it,<br>\
one says طَبَّقَ; a poet says, describing a sword,<br>\
يُصَمِّمُ أَحْيَانًا وَحِينًا يُطَبِّقُ<br>\
[It penetrates into the bone, &amp;c., sometimes, and<br>\
at one time it strikes the joint, &amp;c.]: (S, TA:) or<br>\
it passed into the bones: (M:) and ↓ صَمْصَمَ, said<br>\
of a sword, signifies the same: (M, TA:) or<br>\
تَصْمِيمٌ signifies a sword&#39;s penetrating into that<br>\
which is struck with it without its causing any<br>\
sound to be heard; from الصَّمَمُ in the ear. (Ham<br>\
p. 326.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence تَصْمِيمٌ signifies also (tropical:)  A<br>\
man&#39;s keeping constantly, or perseveringly, to the<br>\
thing that he purposes, until he attains [it].<br>\
(Ham ubi suprà.) One says, صَمَّمَ عَلَى كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
kept constantly, or perseveringly, to his opinion<br>\
in respect of such a thing, after his desiring to do<br>\
it. (IDrd, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And صمّم, (S, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. تَصْمِيمٌ, (M, K,) (tropical:)  He acted, or went on,<br>\
with penetrative energy, or with sharpness, vigorousness, and effectiveness, (S, M, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
in an affair, (M, Msb, K, TA,) and in journeying,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) in this case said of a horse, (Z, TA,)<br>\
and in other things; (S;) as also ↓ صَمْصَمَ. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  He bit, and infixed his canine teeth,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) and did not let go what he bit: (S,<br>\
TA:) or صمّم فِى عَضَّتِهِ he infixed his teeth [or<br>\
canine teeth] in his bite. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And صمّم<br>\
الفَرَسَ العَلَفَ (tropical:)  He (a man) enabled the horse to<br>\

retain the narrative, or story, in his memory.<br>\

-A2-  اصمّهُ He, (God, S, Msb, K,) or it, (a<br>\
disease, M,) rendered him deaf; (S, * M, * Msb,<br>\
K; *) [or] caused him to have a stoppage of the<br>\
ear, and a heaviness of hearing. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] أَصَمَّنِى الكَلَامَ (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, diverted me<br>\
from hearing the speech; as though he, or it,<br>\
rendered me deaf. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, اصمّهُ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, caused him to be as though<br>\
he heard not. ―<br>\
-b4-  And hence, (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, caused<br>\
him, or it, to utter, or make, no sound or noise;<br>\
like him who, not hearing, returns no reply to a<br>\
call, or question; to be dumb, or mute.] One says,<br>\
أَصَمَّ اللّٰهُ صَدَاهُ (tropical:)  [May God make his echo to return<br>\
no sound;] meaning may God destroy him:<br>\
(TA:) a prov., said in imprecating death upon a<br>\
man; the صدي being that which returns the like<br>\
of his voice, or cry, from the mountains &amp;c.; and<br>\
when a man dies, the صدي hears not from him<br>\
anything that it should answer him, so that it is<br>\
as though it were deaf. (Meyd.) [In the vulgar<br>\
language, ↓ صَمَّمَ likewise signifies (assumed tropical:)  He silenced<br>\
him, reduced him to silence, or closed his mouth:<br>\
so says De Sacy, in his Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed.,<br>\
iii. 379.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And اصمّهُ [in the CK اَصْمَمَهُ] also<br>\
signifies He found him to be أَصَمّ [i. e. deaf]. (S,<br>\
M, K.) One says, نَادَاهُ فَأَصَمَّهُ [He called him,<br>\
or called to him, and found him to be deaf].<br>\
(TA.) And أَصَمَّ دُعَاؤُهُ His call found persons<br>\
deaf to it, (Th, M, K,) who would not hear his<br>\
censure. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See also 1, near the end.<br>\
6<br>\
تصامّ He feigned himself to be أَصَمّ [i. e.<br>\
deaf]. (S.) [It is intrans. and trans.] You say,<br>\
تصامّ عَنْهُ and تصامّهُ He feigned to him that he<br>\
was deaf. (M.) And تصامّ عَنِ الحَدِيثِ (M, K)<br>\
and تصامّهُ (M) He feigned (M, K) to his companion (M) that he was deaf to the narrative, or<br>\
story. (M, K. *) تَصَامَمْتُهُ means تَصَامَمْتُ مِنْهُ<br>\
[or عَنْهُ], i. e. I made a show of being deaf [to it],<br>\
and feigned myself inattentive [to it]. (Ham p.<br>\

poet, cited by Th, says,<br>\
قُلْ مَا بَدَا لَكَ مِنْ زُورٍ وَمِنْ كَذِبٍ<br>\
حِلْمِى أَصَمُّ وَأُذْنِى غَيْرُ صَمَّآءِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [the last word I find written thus, app. for the<br>\
sake of the rhyme: i. e. Say what occurs to thee,<br>\
of falsehood and of lying: my forbearance is deaf,<br>\
i. e. insensible, to it, though my ear is not deaf].<br>\
(M, TA.) صَمَّآءُ is applied to a قَطَاة [or bird of<br>\
the species termed قَطًا, and may in this case be<br>\
rendered (assumed tropical:)  Small-eared, or dull-eared, being applied thereto] because of the سَكَك [i. e. smallness<br>\
&amp;c.] of its ear or because it is deaf when thirsting.<br>\
(M.) And الأَصَمُّ [as though meaning (tropical:)  The deafmute] is an epithet applied to رَجَب, (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K,) the month thus named, (Msb,) which the<br>\
people of the Time of Ignorance called شَهْرُ اللّٰهِ<br>\
الأَصَمُّ, (Kh, S,) because the cry of the caller for<br>\
aid was not heard in it, (Kh, S, M, Msb, K, *)<br>\
shouting يَا لَفُلَانٍ and يَا صَبَاحَاهْ, (M, K,) nor the<br>\
commotion of fight, (Kh, S, Msb,) nor the clash<br>\
of arms, it being one of the sacred months: (Kh,<br>\
S:) thus applied it is tropical, like نَائِمٌ in the<br>\
phrase لَيْلٌ نَائِمٌ; as though, in it, the man were<br>\
deaf to the sound of arms: (TA:) and in like<br>\
manner it is also called مُنْصِلُ الأَلِّ. (M. [See<br>\
also الأَصَبُّ, and مُحَرَّمٌ, and شَهْرٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [as<br>\
that which is without a cavity is generally nonsonorous,] one says حَجَرٌ أَصَمُّ meaning (tropical:)  Hard<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K) and solid (S, Msb, K) stone:<br>\
(S, &amp;c.:) and صَخْرَةٌ صَمَّآءُ (tropical:)  a hard and solid rock:<br>\
(K, TA:) or this latter signifies (assumed tropical:)  a rock in which<br>\
is no crack nor hole: pl. صُمٌّ. (TA.) And قَنَاةٌ<br>\
صَمَّآءُ (assumed tropical:)  A compact spear-shaft. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  الصَّمَّآءُ<br>\
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The earth, or ground. (M:) And<br>\
أَرْضٌ صَمَّآءُ (assumed tropical:)  Rugged ground: pl. صُمٌّ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
Also [app. (assumed tropical:)  The vermiform appendage of the<br>\
cœcum;] the thin, or slender, extremity of the<br>\
عفجة: (K: [the last word in this explanation is<br>\
thus, without any syll. signs, in my MS. copy of<br>\
the K and in the TA: in the CK, عَفِجَة: but the<br>\
right reading is evidently عِفَجَة, which is said in<br>\
the TA, in art. عفج, to be, like أَعْفَاجٌ, a pl. of<br>\
عَفَجٌ and its dial. vars.: see this last word:] thus<br>\
called [in my opinion because resembling a<br>\
meatus auditorius that is closed, and therefore<br>\
deaf; though said to be so called] because of its<br>\
hardness. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And نَاقَةٌ صَمَّآءُ (tropical:)  A fat she-camel: (K, TA:) and, (K,) or as some say,<br>\
(TA,) one that has just conceived, or become<br>\
pregnant. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  اِشْتِمَالُ الصَّمَّآءِ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K, TA,) which is forbidden in a trad., (TA,) is<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The covering oneself with his garment, like [as<br>\
is done in the case of] the شِمْلَة of the Arabs of<br>\
the desert with their [garments called] أَكْسِيَة [pl.<br>\
of كِسَآء]; (A&#39;Obeyd, S;) i. e. the turning the<br>\
كِسَآء, from the direction of one&#39;s right, upon his<br>\
left arm and the part between his left shoulderjoint and neck, and then turning it a second time,<br>\
from behind him, upon his right arm and the<br>\
part between his right shoulder-joint and neck, so<br>\
as to cover them both: (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K:) or the<br>\
wrapping oneself with the garment without making<br>\
to it a place from which to put forth the hand:<br>\
(Msb:) or, (K,) as the lawyers explain it,<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, S,) it is the wrapping one&#39;s body and<br>\
arms with one garment, not having upon him<br>\
another, and then raising it [in the K, as is said<br>\
in the TA, يَضَعُهُ is erroneously put for يَرْفَعُهُ] on<br>\
one of its sides, and putting it upon his shoulder,<br>\
so that his pudendum appears from it: (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
S, K:) [but] with the Arabs, لِبْسَةُ الصَّمَّآءِ means<br>\
the covering one&#39;s whole body with his garment,<br>\
and not raising a side from which to put forth<br>\
his hand: (Mgh:) when you say, of a man,<br>\
اِشْتَمَلَ الصَّمَّآءَ, it is as though you said, اِشْتَمَلَ<br>\
الشِّمْلَةَ الصَّمَّآءَ; for الصَّمَّآء is a sort of اِشْتِمَال. (S.<br>\
[See also اِشْتَمَلَ, and الشِّمْلَةُ الصَّمَّآءُ, in art. شمل.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  جَذْرٌ أَصَمُّ (assumed tropical:)  A surd, or an irrational, root, in<br>\
arithmetic; which is known only to God, accord.<br>\
to a saying of &#39;Áïsheh: opposed to جَذْرٌ نَاطِقٌ.<br>\
(Mgh in art. جذر.) ―<br>\
-b8-  [فِعْلٌ أَصَمُّ A surd verb<br>\
is a term sometimes used in grammar, as meaning<br>\
a triliteral-radical verb of the class commonly<br>\
called مُضَاعَفٌ of which the second and third<br>\
radicals are the same letter.]<br>\
صَوْتٌ مَصِمٌّ A sound, or noise, or voice, that<br>\
deafens the ear-hole. (TA.)<br>\
أَلْفٌ مُصَمَّمٌ (assumed tropical:)  A thousand completed; like<br>\
مُصَمَّتٌ and مُصْمَتٌ. (TA in art. صمت.)<br>\
مُصَمِّمٌ A sword that passes into the bones: (M:)<br>\
or that penetrates into that which is struck with<br>\
it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also صِمْصِمٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  A strong<br>\
camel: so says Aboo-&#39; Amr Esh-Sheybánee: and<br>\
he cites the saying,<br>\
حَمَّلْتُ أَثْقَالِى مُصَمِّمَاتِهَا<br>\
[as meaning I loaded their strong camels with<br>\
my burdens]: (TA:) or the مُصَمِّمَات, here mentioned, are the camels that do not utter a grumbling cry; patient of travel. (Ham p. 791.)<br>\
