صَمَتَ, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb,) aor.<br>\
صَمُتَ, (S, M,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. صَمْتٌ (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and<br>\
صُمْتٌ (M, L, TA) and صُمُوتٌ and صُمَاتٌ, (S, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) or the first of these is the inf. n.<br>\
and the rest are simple substs.; (M;) and<br>\
↓ اصمت, (S, M, Msb,) inf. n. إِصْمَاتٌ; (K;) and<br>\
↓ صمّت, inf. n. تَصْمِيتٌ; (S, K; but only the<br>\
inf. n. is mentioned;) He was, or became, silent,<br>\
mute, or speechless; syn. سَكَتَ: (S, A, Msb, K:)<br>\
or he was, or became, long silent or mute or speechless: (M, Mgh:) but there is a difference between<br>\
سَكَتَ and صَمَتَ; for the former is said of him<br>\
who has the power, or faculty, of speech, but<br>\
abstains from making use of it; whereas the latter<br>\
is sometimes said of that which has not the power,<br>\
or faculty, of speech. (Er-Rághib, MF and TA<br>\
in art. سكت.) The Arabs say, (Ks, TA,) and it is<br>\
said in a trad., (TA,) لَا صَمْتَ يَوْمًا إِلَى اللَّيْلِ, or<br>\
يَوْمٌ, or يَوْمٍ, i. e. There shall be no keeping silence<br>\
a whole day [until night]. (Ks, K, TA. [In the<br>\
“ Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer,” we find لا صُمَاتَ instead of<br>\
لا صَمْتَ: and El-Munáwee, in his Commentary<br>\
on that work, says that the keeping silence for a<br>\
whole day is forbidden by the words of this trad.<br>\
because it is an imitation of a Christian custom.])<br>\
And إِذْنُهَا صُمَاتُهَا [in another trad., relating to the<br>\
asking a virgin if she consent to be married, lit.<br>\
Her permission is her silence,] means her silence<br>\
is like her permission, i. e. it suffices. (Msb.)<br>\
One says also, جَآءَ بِمَا صَآءَ وَصَمَتَ (assumed tropical:)  [He brought<br>\
what was vocal and what was mute]; مَا صَآءَ<br>\
meaning sheep, or goats, and camels; and مَا صَمَتَ,<br>\
gold and silver: (IAar, TA:) صَآءَ in this saying is<br>\
formed by transposition from صَأَى [q. v.]. (S in<br>\
art. صأى.)<br>\
2<br>\
صمّتهُ, (M, A, K,) inf. n. تَصْمِيتٌ; (S;) and<br>\
↓ اصمتهُ; (M, A, Msb, K;) He made him, or<br>\
rendered him, silent, mute, or speechless: (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K:) or he made him, or rendered him, long<br>\
silent or mute or speechless. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
صَمِّتِى صَبِيَّكِ Feed thy child with that which<br>\
will silence it [or quiet it]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
صمّت الرَّجُلَ He inclined to the man who complained to him by reason of his complaint [and so<br>\
quieted him; or he cared for the complaint of the<br>\
man and so quieted him; see مُصَمِّتٌ]. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, first sentence.<br>\
4<br>\
اصمتهُ: see 2. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] لَمْ يُصْمِتْهُ ذٰلِكَ<br>\
That did not suffice him [so as to quiet him]: said<br>\
only of what is eaten and drunk. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
اصمتهُ He made it to be solid, not hollow; without<br>\
a cavity. (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K.) [For that which is<br>\
without a cavity is generally non-sonorous.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And أُصْمِتَتِ الأَرْضُ, or أَصْمَتَت, (accord. to different copies of the K, the latter accord. to the O,)<br>\
The land became altered (أَحَالَت) [so as to be<br>\
rugged, or hard, app. in consequence of its having<br>\
been left untilled and unsown,] at the end of two<br>\
years, (O, K,) and had rugged patches of urine<br>\
and dung. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
أَصْمَتَ also signifies He was, or became, tonguetied, (O, TA,) and spoke not; (TA;) said of a<br>\
sick man. (O, TA.)<br>\
صُمْتَةٌ a subst. from صَمَتَ [as such signifying<br>\
Silence, muteness, or speechlessness; like صَمْتٌ<br>\
used as a subst., and صُمْتٌ &amp;c.; and like سُكْتَةٌ<br>\
and سِكْتَةٌ]. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (M, TA) A thing,<br>\
(M, A, K, TA,) i. e. food, (A, K, TA,) or the<br>\
like, (K, TA,) such as a date, or something pretty,<br>\
(TA,) with which one silences [or quiets] (M, A,<br>\
K, TA) a child; (A, K, TA;) as also ↓ صِمْتَةٌ;<br>\
(Lh, M, TA;) like سُكْتَةٌ [in this sense as well as<br>\
in the former sense]. (S.) A date is called صُمْتَةُ<br>\
الصَّبِىِّ [The quieter of the child], (M, TA,) and<br>\
صُمْتَةُ الصَّغِيرِ [The quieter of the little one], so in<br>\
a trad., because when the little one cries, or weeps,<br>\
he is silenced with it. (TA.) One says, مَا عِنْدَهَا<br>\
صُمْتَةُ لَيْلَةٍ She has not as much as would silence<br>\
[or quiet] her child during one night. (A.) And<br>\
مَا لَهُ صُمْتَةٌ لِعِيَالِهِ and ↓ صِمْتَةٌ He has not what<br>\
would feed and silence [or quiet] his household, or<br>\
family. (Lh, M.)<br>\
صِمْتَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
مَا ذُقْتُ صَمَاتًا [I did not taste, or have not<br>\
tasted,] anything. (K.)<br>\
رَمَاهُ بِصُمَاتِهِ, (AZ, K, A, K, [in a copy of the<br>\
M بصِمَاتِه, but this I think a mistranscription,])<br>\
or ↓ بِصُمَاتَةٍ, (K accord. to the TA, and so in the<br>\
M in art. سكت,) [both probably correct, for] one<br>\
says also بِسُكَاتِهِ (AZ, S) and بِسُكَاتَةٍ, (S, M, A, K,<br>\
in art. سكت,) He (a man, AZ, S, or God, A)<br>\
smote him, or afflicted him, with a thing that<br>\
silenced him. (AZ, S, M, A, K.) [See رَمَاهُ بِسُكَاتٍ,<br>\
in art. سكت.] ―<br>\
-b2-  صُمَاتٌ signifies also Thirst:<br>\
(As, TA:) or quickness of thirsting, (M, K, TA,)<br>\
in men and in beasts. (M, TA.)<br>\
فُلَانٌ عَلَى صِمَاتِ الأَمْرِ Such a one is, or was,<br>\
at the point of accomplishing the affair. (S.)<br>\
And أَنَا عَلَى صِمَاتِ حَاجَتِى I am at the point of<br>\
accomplishing my want. (M.) And بَاتَ عَلَى<br>\
صِمَاتِ أَمْرِهِ He passed the night resolved upon his<br>\
affair. (TA.) And هُوَ بِصِمَاتِهِ He is at the point<br>\
of [attaining] his purpose: (M, TA:) Aboo-Málik says that صِمَاتٌ signifies قَصْدٌ [i. e. purpose,<br>\
intention, &amp;c.]. (TA.) And one says, بَاتَ مِنَ<br>\
القَوْمِ عَلَى صِمَاتٍ He passed the night in a place<br>\
where he was seen and heard by the people, near<br>\
to them. (S, TA.)<br>\
دِرْعٌ صَمُوتٌ (tropical:)  A coat of mail from which no<br>\
sound is heard to proceed when it is put on, (S,<br>\
A, L, TA,) it being soft to the feel, not rough nor<br>\
rusty: (L, TA:) or a heavy coat of mail. (K.)<br>\
And جَارِيَةٌ صَمُوتُ الخَلْخَالَيْنِ (tropical:)  A girl, or young<br>\
woman, having thick legs, form whose pair of<br>\
anklets no sound is heard to proceed, (K, TA,)<br>\
by reason of their being depressed in her legs.<br>\
(TA. [لَها in the CK is erroneously put for لَهُمَا.])<br>\
And سَيْفٌ صَمُوتٌ (assumed tropical:)  A sword that penetrates deeply<br>\
into the thing struck with it [so as not to make a<br>\
sound by its being repelled by a bone]. (K, TA.)<br>\
And ضَرْبَةٌ صَمُوتٌ (assumed tropical:)  A blow [with a sword or the<br>\
like] passing among the bones, not recoiling from<br>\
a bone (M, K, TA) so as to make a sound. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And شَهْدَةٌ صَمُوتٌ (tropical:)  A honey-comb that is full;<br>\
not having a cell empty. (A, K.)<br>\
صُمَاتَة: see رَمَاهُ بِصُمَاتِهِ, above.<br>\
صِمِّيتٌ, applied to a man, (S,) i. q. سِكِّيتٌ, (S,<br>\
K, TA,) [i. e. Much, or often, silent or mute or<br>\
speechless; or] long silent &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
صَامِتٌ Silent, mute, or speechless: (Msb:) pl.<br>\
صَامِتُونَ (Kur vii. 192) [and صُمُوتٌ, occurring in<br>\
the K in art. زم]. [Hence,] one says, مَا لَهُ صَامِتٌ<br>\
وَلَا نَاطِقٌ (tropical:)  [He has not mute nor vocal property;<br>\
or he has not dead nor live stock]: (S, M, A:) by<br>\
the former are meant gold and silver; (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K;) and by the latter, camels, (S, K,) and<br>\
sheep or goats, (S,) or animals: (M:) i. e. he has<br>\
not aught. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, of camels, (assumed tropical:)  Twenty,<br>\
(O, K,) and the like. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And of milk,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Such as is thick. (S, O, K.)<br>\
أَصْمَتُ: see مُصْمِتٌ.<br>\
لَقِيتُهُ بِوَحْشِ إِصْمِتَ and بِبَلْدَةِ إِصْمِتَ AZ explains as meaning [I met him, or met with him,<br>\
or found him,] in a desert place, in which was no<br>\
one to cheer by his company: (S: [and in like<br>\
manner the latter phrase is expl. in the M:])<br>\
accord. to Kr, بِبَلْدَةٍ إِصْمِتَ; but the phrase<br>\
commonly known is بِبَلْدَةِ إِصْمِتَ: (M:) or<br>\
تَرَكْتُهُ بِبَلْدَةِ إِصْمِتَ [I left him] in the desert, or<br>\
waterless desert: or in such a place that it was<br>\
not known where he was: (K:) and بِصَحْرَآءِ إِصْمِتَ<br>\
(M, K) meaning as above, (K,) or having the<br>\
latter of these two meanings: (M:) and بِوَحْشِ<br>\
إِصْمِتَ and ↓ إِصْمِتَةَ, (M, K,) mentioned, but not<br>\
expl., by Lh, (M,) meaning as above, (K,) or<br>\
app. meaning in the desert, or waterless desert:<br>\
(M:) and some say, بِوَحْشِ الإِصْمِتَيْنِ: (TA:)<br>\
اصمت is as above, with the disjunctive alif; and<br>\
also with the conjunctive [i. e. اصْمِتَ]: (O, K:)<br>\
it is imperfectly decl., (S, MF, TA,) because combining the quality of a proper name with the fem.<br>\
gender or with the measure of a verb: (MF,<br>\
TA:) it is said that the desert, or waterless desert,<br>\
is thus called because in it one fears much; as<br>\
though everyone [therein] said to his companion,<br>\
اصمت [i. e. اُصْمُتْ or أَصْمِتْ, “Be thou silent ”];<br>\
like as they say of a مَهْمَه that it is so called<br>\
because a man [therein] says to his companion,<br>\
مَهْ مَهْ: (MA:) [for] accord. to some the word<br>\
إِصْمِت is an imperative changed into a subst., and<br>\
hence the ء is disjunctive, and it may be with kesr<br>\
accord. to a dial. var. [of the imperative] that has<br>\
not reached us: accord. to Yákoot, it is the name<br>\
of a particular desert; but others say that the<br>\
proper name [of that desert] is وَحْشُ إِصْمِتَ.<br>\
(TA in art. وحش.)<br>\
إِصْمِتَة: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مُضْمَتٌ [primarily signifies Made, or rendered,<br>\
silent, mute, or speechless. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] Solid;<br>\
not hollow; having no cavity. (A &#39;Obeyd, S, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K.) [For that which is without a<br>\
cavity is generally non-sonorous.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And A<br>\
door, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) and a lock, (M, K,)<br>\
closed, or locked, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) so that<br>\
one cannot find the way to open it. (S, M, * K. *)<br>\
A poet says,<br>\
وَمِنْ دُونِ لَيْلَى مُصْمَتَاتُ المَقَاصِرِ<br>\
[And in the way to Leylà are what are closed,<br>\
&amp;c., of chambers to which the owner alone has<br>\
access: مَقَاصِر being used by poetic license for<br>\
مَقَاصَير, pl. of مَقْصُورَةٌ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A garment, or piece of cloth, of one, unmixed, colour.<br>\
(M, Mgh, K.) The garment thus termed that is<br>\
disliked is That of which the warp and woof are<br>\
both of silk: or such as is woven of undressed silk,<br>\
and then dressed, and dyed of one colour:<br>\
(Mgh:) [or] such as is termed مُصْمَتٌ مِنْ خَزٍّ,<br>\
i. e. consisting entirely of silk, not mixed with<br>\
cotton nor with other material, was forbidden by<br>\
the Prophet. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence,] فَرَسٌ مُصْمَتٌ<br>\
A horse of one, unmixed, colour; in which is no<br>\
colour differing from the rest: (S, A, TA:) pl.<br>\
خَيْلٌ مُصْمَتَاتٌ. (TA.) And أَدْهَمُ مُصْمَتٌ [applied<br>\
to a horse] (assumed tropical:)  Black unmixed with any other<br>\
colour. (TA.) ―<br>\

vessel not silvered, or not ornamented with silver.<br>\
(Mgh.) And بَيْضَةٌ مُصْمَتَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A helmet made of<br>\
one piece. (AO, TA in art. بيض.) And حَلْىٌ<br>\
مُصْمَتٌ (assumed tropical:)  A woman&#39;s ornament that is not intermixed with another: or, accord. to Ahmad Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Obeyd, that has stuck fast upon its wearer, so<br>\
that it does not move about; such as the armlet,<br>\
and the anklet, and the like. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  The فَهْد<br>\
[or lynx, an animal proverbial for much sleeping,]<br>\
is said to be مُصْمتُ النَّوْمِ (tropical:)  [app. meaning A<br>\
heavy sleeper]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  الحُرُوفُ المُصْمَتَةُ are<br>\
All the letters [of the Arabic alphabet] except<br>\
those called حُرُوفُ الذَّلَاقَةِ [or الحُرُوفُ الذُّلْقُ];<br>\
(M, TA;) i. e. (TA) all the letters except those<br>\
comprised in the phrase مُرْ بِنَفْلٍ. (K, TA.)<br>\
[What is here rendered “ except ” (i. e. مَا عَدَا) is<br>\
said by MF to be omitted in most of the copies of<br>\
the K.] ―<br>\
-b9-  See also مُصَمَّتْ.<br>\
مُصْمِتٌ Tongue-tied; (O, TA;) not speaking:<br>\
(TA:) applied to a sick man [when he is unable<br>\
to speak]: (O, TA:) and ↓ أًصْمَتُ [signifies the<br>\
same,] i. q. أَبْهَمُ and مُبْهَمٌ. (So in copies of the K in<br>\
art. بهم. [In one of the explanations which I have<br>\
given of مُبْهَمٌ in consequence of an omission (to<br>\
be supplied in Book II.), أَصْمَتُ is made syn.<br>\
with مُصْمَتٌ.])<br>\
أَلْفٌ مُصَمَّتٌ (assumed tropical:)  A thousand completed; (M, K;)<br>\
like مُصَتَّمٌ; (M;) as also ↓ مُصْمَتٌ. (K.)<br>\
مُصَمِّتٌ [A silencer, or quieter: and hence, ―<br>\
-b2- ]<br>\
One who cares for another&#39;s complaint. (M, *<br>\
Meyd, TA.) One says, (M, Meyd, TA,) i. e. a<br>\
rájiz says, addressing a camel belonging to him,<br>\
(Har p. 642,)<br>\
إِنَّكَ لَا تَشْكُو إِلَى مُصَمِّتِ<br>\
فَاصْبِرْ عَلَى الحِمْلِ الثَّقِيلِ أَوْ مُتِ<br>\
[Verily thou complainest not to one who cares for<br>\
thy complaint; therefore endure with patience<br>\
the bearing of the heavy burden, or die]. (M,<br>\
Meyd, TA.) تَشْكُو إِلَى غَيْرِ مُصَمِّتٍ, i. e. [Thou<br>\
complainest] to one who cares not for thy case, is<br>\
a proverb. (Meyd.)<br>\
