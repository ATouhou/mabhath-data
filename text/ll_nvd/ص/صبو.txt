صَبَا, (S, M, K,) aor. يَصْبُو, inf. n. صَبْوَةٌ, (S,)<br>\
or صَبْوٌ, (M, K,) and صُبُوٌّ (S, M, K) and صِبًا [also<br>\
written صِبًى, in the CK (erroneously) صَبًى,] and<br>\
صَبَآءٌ, (M, K,) [app., in its primary acceptation,<br>\
He was a youth, or boy, or child; agreeably with<br>\
an explanation of a phrase in what follows, and<br>\
with explanations of صِبًا and صَبَآءٌ which will be<br>\
found below: ―<br>\
-b2-  and hence,] He was, or became,<br>\
youthfully ignorant, or foolish, or silly: (M, K:)<br>\
[and, as seems to be indicated in the TA, he indulged in amorous dalliance; a sense in which<br>\
the verb, more especially with صِبًا (q. v. infrà)<br>\
for its inf. n., is very frequently used:] or he inclined to ignorant, or foolish, or silly, and youthful,<br>\
conduct; and in like manner ↓ تصابى; from<br>\
الصِّبَا, which is from الشَّوْق [i. e. “ desire ”]: (S:<br>\
[see an ex. of the inf. n. of the latter verb in a<br>\
verse cited voce شَابَ, in art. شيب:]) or صِبًا and<br>\
صَبَآءٌ, as inf. ns., signify the inclining the heart to<br>\
any one; and have other significations expl. in<br>\
what follows: and ↓ تَصَابٍ signifies the manifesting passionate love, and desire: (KL:) [but صِبًا<br>\
and صَبَآءٌ are often used in different senses: thus<br>\
Et-Tebreezee says that] in the following hemistich<br>\
of a poem by Dureyd Ibn-Es-Simmeh,<br>\
صَبَا مَا صَبَا حَتَّى عَلَا الشَّيْبُ رَأْسَهُ<br>\
the first صبا may be from الصِّبَى [or الصِّبَا], and<br>\
the second صبا from الصَّبَآءُ signifying الفَتَآءُ; so<br>\
that the meaning may be, He engaged in play, or<br>\
sport, and الصِّبَى [or amorous dalliance, &amp;c.],<br>\
as long as he was a youth, [until hoariness came<br>\
upon his head;] or the meaning may be, he<br>\
engaged in الصِّبِى as long as he engaged therein,<br>\
&amp;c. (Ham p. 380.) And صَبِىَ, (S, M, K,) [aor.<br>\
يَصْبَى,] inf. n. صَبَآءٌ, (S,) or صِبًا, (M,) [or both, as<br>\
will appear from what follows,] signifies He<br>\
played, or sported, with the صِبْيَان [i. e. youths,<br>\
or boys, or children]: (S:) or he acted in the<br>\
manner of the صِبْيَان: (M, K: *) or both صِبًا and<br>\
صَبَآءٌ, as inf. ns., signify the acting as a youth, or<br>\
boy, or child; and the playing, or sporting, with<br>\
youths, or boys, or children: (KL:) and ↓ تصبّى<br>\
and ↓ تصابى, said of an old man, signify he acted<br>\
in a youthful, boyish, or childish, manner. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  صَبَا, inf. n. صُبُوٌّ and صَبْوَةٌ, also signifies He<br>\
inclined. (Msb.) You say, صَبَا إِلَيْهَا He inclined<br>\
to her, namely, a woman; as also صَبِىَ: and in<br>\
like manner, صَبَتْ إِلَيْهِ and صَبِيَتْ [She inclined<br>\
to him]. (M. [See also صُبٌّ, in art. صب.])<br>\
And صَبَا إِلَيْهِ, (M,) or إِلَيْهَا, (K,) inf. n. صَبْوَةٌ (M,<br>\
K) and صُبْوَةٌ (K) and صُبُوٌّ; (M, K;) and صَبِىَ;<br>\

(M, K,) in [some of] the copies of the K صَبَاء,<br>\
(TA,) said of the wind called الصَّبَا, (S, M, K,) It<br>\

-b2-  And صُبِىَ القَوْمُ, (M, K,) like عُنِىَ,<br>\
(K,) The people, or party, were blown upon by<br>\
the wind called الصَّبَا. (M, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
صبّى رَأْسَهُ, inf. n. تَصْبِيَةٌ, He inclined his<br>\

-b2-<br>\
صابى السَّيْفَ He put the sword into its غِمْد<br>\

(TA,) reversed, or inverted: (S, M, K, TA:) or,<br>\
accord. to the A, صابى سَيْفَهُ, and سِكِّينَهُ, means<br>\
he put his sword, and his knife, into its قِرَاب not<br>\

-b8-  And one says,<br>\
الجَوَارِى يُصَابِينَ فِى السِّتْرِ, meaning يطلعن [i. e.<br>\
يَطَّلِعْنَ, but I think that فِى is a mistranscription<br>\
for مِن, and that the meaning is, The girls, or<br>\
young women, look from within the curtain].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَصْبَتْ She (a woman) had a child such as is<br>\
termed صَبِىّ [i. e. a boy, or a young male child];<br>\

Reiske as signifying Pueriliter se et proterve<br>\
gessit:<br>\
-A2-  and by Jac. Schultens as signifying<br>\
Pro puero habuit. But the usage of this verb in<br>\
any sense is app. post-classical.]<br>\
صَبًا [is of the fem. gender, and] is a subst. and<br>\
an epithet, [so that one says رِيحٌ صَبًا, as well as<br>\
صَبًا alone and رِيحُ الصَّبَا,] (M, TA,) [and signifies The east wind: or an easterly wind:] the<br>\
wind that blows from the place of sunrise:<br>\
(Msb:) or the wind of which the mean place<br>\
whence it blows is the place where the sun rises<br>\
when the night and day are equal; the opposite<br>\
wind of which is the دَبُور: (S:) or the wind that<br>\
faces the House [of God, i. e. the Kaabeh; app.<br>\
meaning that blows from the point opposite to the<br>\
corner, of the Kaabeh, that is between the Black<br>\
Stone and the door]; as though yearning towards<br>\
the House: (M, TA:) or, accord. to IAar, (M,)<br>\
the wind of which the place whence it blows<br>\
extends from the place of rising of الثُّرَيَّا [or the<br>\
Pleiades] to [the place of] بَنَات نَعْش [meaning<br>\
the tail of Ursa Major]: (M, K:) [it is often<br>\
commended by poets as a gentle and pleasant<br>\
gale, like the Zephyr with us:] the dual is<br>\
صَبَوَانِ and صَبَيَانِ: (Lh, M, K:) and pl. صَبَوَاتٌ<br>\
and أَصْبَآءٌ. (M, K.)<br>\
صِبًا [also written صِبًى] and ↓ صَبَآءٌ, the former<br>\
with kesr and the short alif, and the latter with<br>\
fet-h and the long alif, (S, Msb,) [both mentioned<br>\
before as inf. ns.,] Youth, or boyhood; the state<br>\
of the صَبِىّ [q. v.]: (S:) or childhood. (Msb.)<br>\
One says, كَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى صِبَاهُ and صَبَائِهِ [That was<br>\
in his youth or boyhood: or in his childhood].<br>\
(Msb.) [See also an ex. in a verse cited in the<br>\
first paragraph of art. شفع.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And the former<br>\
[or each, as is shown in the first sentence of this<br>\
art.,] has also a signification derived from الشَّوْقُ<br>\
[or “ desire; ” i. e., each signifies also An inclining<br>\
to ignorant, or foolish, or silly, and youthful,<br>\
conduct; and amorous dalliance]: (S:) and ↓ صَبْوَةٌ<br>\
signifies [the same, as is also shown in the first<br>\
sentence of this art., or, like صِبًا and صَبَآءٌ,] the<br>\
ignorance, or foolishness, or silliness, of youth;<br>\
(Lth, M, K;) and amorous dalliance. (Lth, TA.)<br>\
[See an ex. of the first in a verse cited in the first<br>\
paragraph of art. ادى; and another in a verse<br>\
cited voce عَارَضَ.]<br>\
صَبْوَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
صَبَآءٌ: see صَبًا.<br>\
صَبِىٌّ A youth, boy, or male child; syn. غُلَامٌ:<br>\
(S:) or a young male child; (Mgh, Msb;) before he is called غُلَام: (Mgh:) or one that has<br>\
not yet been weaned, (M, K,) so called from the<br>\
time of his birth: (M:) and ↓ صَابٍ signifies the<br>\
same as صَبِىٌّ; these two words being like قَادِرٌ<br>\
and قَدِيرٌ: (TA:) the pl. of the former is صِبْيَةٌ [a<br>\
pl. of pauc., in which the و is changed into ى<br>\
because of the kesreh before it, like as is said in<br>\
the M respecting another of the pls.,] (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K, but not in the CK,) and صِبْوَةٌ (M, K, TA, in<br>\
the CK صَبْوَةٌ,) and صُبْيَةٌ (M, K) and صَبْيَةٌ, (K,<br>\
TA, but not in the CK,) [or rather the last two<br>\
are quasi-pl. ns.,] and أَصْبٍ [another pl. of pauc.]<br>\
(K) and أَصْبِيَةٌ [also a pl. of pauc.], (M, K,) but<br>\
this last is said by J to have been unused, because<br>\
the usage of صِبْيَةٌ rendered it needless, (TA,) and<br>\
صِبْيَانٌ, (S, M, Msb, K, but not in the CK,) in<br>\
which the و is changed into ى because of the<br>\
kesreh before it, (M,) and صُبْيَانٌ, (M, K,) as<br>\
some say, preserving the ى notwithstanding the<br>\
dammeh, (M,) and صِبْوَانٌ (M, K, but not in the<br>\
CK,) and صُبْوَانٌ: (M, K:) and [ISd says,]<br>\
accord. to Sb, the dim. of صِبْيَةٌ is ↓ أُصَيْبِيَةٌ, and<br>\
that of أَصْبِيَةٌ is ↓ صُبَيَّةٌ, each irreg.; but in my<br>\
opinion, صُبَيَّةٌ is the dim. of صِبْيَةٌ, and أُصَيْبِيَةٌ is<br>\
that of أَصْبِيَةٌ: (M:) [J says,] أُصَيْبِيَةٌ occurs in<br>\
poetry as being the dim. of أَصْبِيَةٌ. (S.) ↓ صَبِيَّةٌ<br>\
signifies A young woman, girl, or female child;<br>\
(S, TA;) and so too, [sometimes,] صَبِىٌّ: (TA:)<br>\
and the pl. is صَبَايَا. (S TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أُمُّ الصِّبْيَانِ is a<br>\
term applied to The flatus, or flatulence, (الرِّيحُ,)<br>\
that is incident to children. (TA in art. ام.)<br>\
[Golius, in that art., explains it as meaning Larva,<br>\
terriculamentum puerorum; on the authority of<br>\
Meyd.: and also as meaning Epilepsy; on the<br>\
authority of Ibn-Beytár.] ―<br>\
-b3-  صَبِىٌّ also signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The pupil of the eye: (M, K:) but Kr ascribes<br>\
this meaning to the vulgar. (M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  The<br>\
extremity of each of the jaw-bones: (K, TA:)<br>\
i. e. (TA) الصَّبِيَّانِ signifies the two extremities of<br>\
the two jaw-bones (S, M, TA) of the camel and of<br>\
other animals: or, as some say, the two edges<br>\
curving outwards from the middle of the two<br>\
jaw-bones: (M, TA:) or, accord. to the A, the<br>\
thin portions of the two extremities thereof: and<br>\
it is [said to be] tropical. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  A bone<br>\
below the lobe, or lobule, of each of the two ears:<br>\
(K:) or, as some say, the head of the bone that<br>\
is below the lobe, or lobule, of each of the two ears<br>\
by the space of about three fingers put together.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (tropical:)  The edge (حَدّ) of the sword: (M,<br>\
K, TA:) or the ridge thereof, (M, TA, in the<br>\
copies of the K أَوْ غَيْرِهِ is erroneously put for<br>\
أَوْ عَيْرُهُ, TA,) which rises in [i. e. along] its middle;<br>\
(M, K, TA;) and likewise of a spear-head:<br>\
(M, TA:) or, accord. to the A, that part of a<br>\
sword below, or exclusive of, (دُونَ,) its ظُبَة [q. v.].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  The head of the human foot;<br>\
(M, A, TA; in the copies of the K رَأْسُ القَوْمِ is<br>\
erroneously put for رَأْسُ القَدَمِ; TA;) i. e. the<br>\
part [thereof] between its حِمَارَة [q. v.] and the<br>\
toes. (A, TA.) And الصَّبِيَّانِ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
two sides of the [camel&#39;s saddle called] رَحْل.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b7-  It is also said that صِبْيَانُ الجَلِيدِ signifies<br>\
(tropical:)  The grains of hoar-frost that resemble pearls:<br>\
and صِبْيَانُ المَطَرِ (tropical:)  the small drops of rain: but<br>\
accord. to the author of the “ Khasáïl,” it is<br>\
صِئْبَان [pl. of صُؤَابَةٌ, q. v.], with ء and then ب.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
صَبِيَّةٌ fem. of صَبِىٌّ, q. v.<br>\
صُبَيَّةٌ: see صَبِىٌّ, former half.<br>\
صَابٍ: see صَبِىٌّ, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q.<br>\
صَاحِبُ صَبْوَةٍ [i. e. One who indulges in youthful<br>\
folly, and amorous dalliance]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Kureysh, (M,) or the Jews, (TA,) used to call the<br>\
Companions of the Prophet صُبَاةٌ. (M, TA. [See<br>\
صَابِئٌ, in art. صبأ.]) And Náfi&#39; read [in the Kur<br>\
ii. 59 and xxii. 17] الصَّابِينَ instead of الصَّابِئِينَ;<br>\
(TA;) and [in v. 73] الصَّابِيُونَ instead of الصَّابِئُونَ.<br>\
(TA voce صَابِئٌ.) ―<br>\
-b4-  صُبَّى, a pl. of صَابٍ, is expl.<br>\
as meaning Those who incline to conflicts and<br>\
factions, seditions, or the like, and love to be<br>\
foremost therein. (TA. [See صُبٌّ, in art. صب.])<br>\
الصَّابِيَةُ The oblique wind (النُّكَيْبَآءُ, dim. of<br>\
النَّكْبَآءُ,) that blows in a direction between that of<br>\
the east or easterly wind (الصَّبَا) and that of the<br>\
north or northerly wind (الشَّمَال): (S, K:) it is<br>\
very cold, (S and TA voce نَكْبَآءُ,) and very<br>\
boisterous, and unattended by rain or by any good.<br>\
(TA ibid.)<br>\
أُصَيْبِيَةٌ: see صَبِىٌّ.<br>\
مُصْبٍ, (Ks, Az, M,) or مُصْبِيَةٌ, (S, A,) or both,<br>\
(K,) applied to a woman, (Ks, Az, S, M, A,<br>\
K,) and the former also applied to a man, (Er-Rághib, TA,) Having صِبْيَة [i. e. children, or<br>\
young children, or young unweaned children], (S,<br>\
Er-Rághib, A, *) or having a child such as is<br>\
termed صَبِىّ. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the latter is<br>\
metaphorically applied by El-Hareeree to (tropical:)  Wine<br>\
