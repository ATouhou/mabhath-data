صَفَّ, (S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
صَفُ3َ,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) inf. n. صَفٌّ, (O, Msb, K, TA,) He<br>\
set, or placed, or stationed, (S, M, Mgh, O, K,)<br>\
a company of men, (S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) in<br>\
war (S, O, K) &amp;c., (O, K,) and a military force,<br>\
(TA,) and also [in a similar sense] a thing, (Msb,)<br>\
in a rank, or row, or line: (S, M, Mgh, O, K:)<br>\
and likewise ↓ صفّف, (TA,) inf. n. تَصْفِيفٌ; (IDrd,<br>\
O, K, TA;) but this has an intensive signification.<br>\
(IDrd, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also of a she-camel,<br>\
تَصُفُّ يَدَيْهَا عِنْدَ الحَلَبِ [She sets her fore legs<br>\
evenly, side by side, not putting one of them in<br>\
advance of the other, as if about to go onward,<br>\
on the occasion of being milked]. (S, M, O, K.)<br>\
[See also صَفَنَ, said of a man: and see صَانَ in<br>\
art. صون.]) And [in like manner] one says,<br>\
صَفَّتِ الإِبِلُ قَوَائِمَهَا [The camels set their legs in<br>\
an even row]. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And of a she-camel<br>\
one says also, تَصُفُّ أَقْدَاحًا مِنْ لَبَنِهَا إِذَا حُلِبَتْ [as<br>\
though meaning She yields a row of bowls of<br>\
her milk when she is milked], because of the abundance of her milk. (S, O, K *.) And تَصُفُّ بَيْنَ<br>\
مِحْلَبَيْنِ أَوْ ثَلَاثَةٍ, (S, O,) or simply تَصُفُّ, (M,)<br>\
She combines two milking-vessels, or three, at one<br>\
milking; (S, * M, O; *) الصَّفُّ meaning her being<br>\
milked into two milking-vessels, or three, (S, O,<br>\
K,) so as to combine them. (S, O. [In the CK,<br>\
أَنْ تَحْلُبَ is a mistake for أَنْ تُحْلَبَ.]) And a<br>\
rájiz, cited by AZ, says, referring to a she-camel,<br>\
تَصُفُّ فِى ثَلَاثَةِ المَحَالِبِ<br>\
[She is milked into three milking-vessels at one<br>\
milking]. (S, O.) One says also صَفَّهَا, i. e. حَلَبَهَا صَفًّا<br>\
[app. meaning He milked her into two bowls, or<br>\
three, at one milking; or into two bowls; the<br>\
pronoun referring to a she-camel]. (M. [One or<br>\
the other of these two meanings appears to be<br>\
indicated by what there precedes this.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  صُفَّ<br>\
عَلَى الجَمْرِ لِيَنْشَوِىَ (S, K) is said of flesh-meat<br>\
(S) [app. meaning It was laid, cut into a strip,<br>\
or into strips, upon the live coals to broil]; and<br>\
فِى الشَّمْسِ لِيَجِفَّ [in like manner, in the sun to<br>\
dry]: (K:) for one says of him who has prepared<br>\
flesh-meat cut into strips, or oblong pieces, and<br>\
dried in the sun, صَفَّ اللَّحْمَ; and [in like manner]<br>\
one says also, صَفَّهُ عَلَى النَّارِ لِيَنْشَوِىَ: (Msb:) or<br>\
صَفَّ اللَّحْمَ, aor.<br>\
صَفُ3َ, inf. n. صَفُّ, means he cut<br>\
the flesh-meat into broad slices: (M:) and accord.<br>\
to ISh, ↓ التَّصْفِيفُ is like التَّشْرِيحُ, i. e. the cutting<br>\
a piece of flesh-meat thin, so that it is translucent: (TA in the present art:) or التصفيف is a<br>\
kind of تَشْرِيح; i. e. the cutting a piece of flesh-meat thin, so that it is translucent by reason of<br>\
its thinness, and then throwing it upon the live<br>\
coals. (TA in art. شرح.) [See صَفِيفٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also 8, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  صَفَّ said of a bird,<br>\
(M, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
صَفُ3َ, (M, Msb,) inf. n. صَفٌّ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) It extended its wings in a line, (M,)<br>\
or it expanded its wings, (O, Msb, K,) in the sky,<br>\
and did not move them, (M,) or and struck [an<br>\
evident mistake for and did not strike] with them<br>\
its sides like the pigeon: (Msb:) such as do so<br>\
are not to be eaten; (Msb, K;) as the vulture<br>\
and the hawk: (Msb:) it is said in a trad.,<br>\
يُؤْكَلُ مَا دَفَّ وَلَا يُؤْكَلُ مَا صَفَّ. (O, K, TA. See<br>\
art. دف.)<br>\
-A3-  صَفَفْتُ لِلسَّرْجِ, (S,) or صَفَفْتُ لِلسَّرْجِ<br>\
صُفَّةً, (O,) or صَفَفْتُ السَّرْجَ, (K, and so in one<br>\
place in the O,) and ↓ أَصْفَفْتُهُ, (O, K,) but this<br>\
latter verb is of weak authority, (O,) (tropical:)  I put to<br>\
the horse&#39;s saddle a صُفَّة [q. v.]: S, O, K, TA:)<br>\
[and] صَفَّ الدَّابَّةَ, and صَفَّ لَهَا, He made for the<br>\
beast a صُفَّة. (M.)<br>\
2<br>\
صَفَّ3َ see above, first sentence: ―<br>\
-b2-  and also in the<br>\
latter half of the paragraph.<br>\
3<br>\
صَافُّوهُمْ (S, MA, O,K) فِى القِتَالِ (S, O, K)<br>\
They fought them in rank; they drew themselves<br>\
out in a rank against them [in fight]. (MA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
[And app. one says also صَافَّهُ meaning He had the<br>\
صُفَّة of his house over against, or facing, his<br>\
(another&#39;s) صُفَّة. See هُوَ مُصَافِّى, below.]<br>\
4<br>\
أَصْفَ3َ see 1, last sentence.<br>\
6<br>\
تَصَاْفَ3َ see 8. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also تصافّوا عَلَيْهِ They<br>\
collected themselves together in a rank, or row, or<br>\
line, against him. (M, TA.) And تصافّوا عَلَى المَآءِ<br>\
They collected themselves together at the water;<br>\
as also تضافّوا عَلَيْهِ: like as one says تصوّك فِى<br>\
خُرْئِهِ and تضوّك, and صَلَاصِلُ المَآءِ and ضَلَاضِلُهُ.<br>\
(Lh, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اصطفّوا They stood in, (S, Mgh, O, K,) or<br>\
became, (M,) [or set, placed, or stationed, themselves in,] a rank, or row, or line; (S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb; *) or ranks, or rows, or lines; (O, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ تصافّوا; (M, O, * K; * [التَّصَافُّ being expl.<br>\
in the O and K by التَّسَاطُرُ; in the CK, erroneously, التَّشاطُرُ;]) and so ↓ صَفُّوا, (M, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
صَفُ3َ, (M, Mgh,) inf. n. صَفٌّ and صَفَّى, but<br>\
[ISd says] this latter inf. n. I have not heard except in a phrase mentioned in what follows. (M.)<br>\
Hence the saying,تَصُفُّ ↓ النِّسَآءُ خَلْفَ الرِّجَالِ وَلَا  <br>\
تَصُفُّ مَعَهُمْ [The women shall stand in a rank behind the men in the mosque, and shall not stand<br>\
in a rank with them]. (Mgh.) And hence the<br>\
saying of a woman of the desert to her sons,<br>\
↓ إِذَا لَقِيتُمُ العَدُوَّ فَدَغَرَى وَلَا صَفَّى i. e. [When ye<br>\
meet the enemy, rush upon them without consideration, and] do not set yourselves in a rank.<br>\
(M. [See also 1, in art. دغر.])<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
صَفْصَفَ He journeyed, (سَارَ, O, and<br>\
so in copies of the K,) or became, (صَارَ, so in the<br>\
CK,) alone in a صَفْصَف, or level tract of land.<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  And He pastured upon the trees<br>\
called صَفْصَاف. (O, K.)<br>\
-A3-  And صَفْصَفَةٌ [as an<br>\
inf. n., or as a simple subst.,] signifies The crying<br>\
or cry, (صَوْت,) of the sparrow, which is called<br>\
صُفْصُف (O, K) in some one or more of the<br>\
dialects. (O.)<br>\
صَفٌّ A rank, row, or line [of things]; (KL,<br>\
PS;) or an even صَدْر [i. e. front, or fore part,]<br>\
of any things: (M:) and a company of men<br>\
standing in a rank, or row, or line: (O, K:)<br>\
pl. صُفُوفٌ; (S, M, O, Msb, K;) and the sing.<br>\
may also be used in the sense of the pl.; it may<br>\
be used either thus in the sense of the pl. or as a<br>\
sing. in the Kur xviii. 46. (O.) Hence, in a<br>\
trad., سَوُّوا صُفُوفَكُمْ [Make even your ranks] in<br>\
prayer. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A station of صُفُوف<br>\
[or ranks of men]. (M. [See also مَصَفٌّ.]) And<br>\
hence, (M,) as used in the Kur xx. 67, i. q. مُصَلًّى<br>\
[i. e. A place of prayer, or a place of prayer on<br>\
the occasion of the عِيد, or festival]; (Az, M, O;)<br>\
because the people stand there in ranks: (M:)<br>\
i. e. a place where people assemble for their عِيد:<br>\
(Az, O:) or, in that instance, صَفًّا may mean<br>\
مُصْطَفِّينَ [i. e. standing in ranks], (Az, M, O,)<br>\
as a denotative of state. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A pair of<br>\
bowls (قَدَحَانِ) [app., as seems to be indicated,<br>\
that are filled at one milking of a camel]; because they are put together. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A<br>\
certain medicament with which the teeth are<br>\
whitened. (O.)<br>\
صُفَّةٌ An appertenance of a house, (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K, [in none of which is it explained,]) or of<br>\
a building, like a wide بَهُو [here used in a postclassical sense, as meaning a kind of vestibule, or<br>\
portico, for shade and shelter, open in front], with<br>\
a long roof or ceiling; (Lth, TA;) the طُرَّة of a<br>\
building [app. meaning what is above described];<br>\
(M;) i. q. سَقِيفَةٌ: (S and Msb and K in art.<br>\
سقف:) [see سَفِيفَةٌ; and see also سُدَّةٌ:] and i. q.<br>\
ظُلَّةٌ [i. e. a roof, or covering, for shade and<br>\
shelter, over the door of a house; or extending<br>\
from a house to another house opposite; like<br>\
سُدَّةٌ and سَقِيفَةٌ]: (M:) [for the meaning assigned<br>\
to it by Golius as from the S, and by Freytag as<br>\
from the K and S, (“ scamnum discubitorium,<br>\
fere ex lapidibus structum,”) I find no authority<br>\
in any Arabic work: in Egypt, it is applied to a<br>\
shelf of marble or of common stone, about four<br>\
feet high, supported by two or more arches, or by<br>\
a single arch, figured and described in the Introduction to my work on the Modern Egyptians;<br>\
this being app. so called because resembling in<br>\
form, though not in size, a porch:] the pl. is<br>\
صُفَفٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and صِفَافٌ and صُفَّاتٌ.<br>\
(Mgh.) أَهْلُ الصُّفَّةِ [The people of the صُفَّة] was<br>\
an appellation applied to certain persons who were<br>\
the guests of El-Islám, [i. e. supported by the<br>\
charity of the Muslims,] (O, K, TA,) consisting<br>\
of poor refugees, and houseless men, (TA,) who<br>\
passed the night in the صُفَّة of the mosque of the<br>\
Prophet [in El-Medeeneh], which was a covered<br>\
place, an appertenance of the mosque, (O, K,<br>\
TA,) roofed over with palm-sticks; (Har p. 379;<br>\
[where see more;]) thither they resorted for<br>\
lodging; and sometimes they were few, and sometimes they were many: [SM says,] I have drawn<br>\
up a list of their names, in a tract, to the number<br>\
of ninety-two, (TA in the present art.,) or ninetythree. (TA voce أَوْفَاضٌ.) [ISd says,] عَذَابُ يَوْمِ<br>\
الصُّفَّةِ [The punishment of the day of the صُفَّة] is<br>\
the same as عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الظُّلَّةِ [mentioned in the<br>\
Kur xxvi. 189]: (M, TA:) Lth says that the<br>\
former was a day on which a certain people disobeyed their apostle, wherefore God sent upon<br>\
them heat and clouds which overspread them, so<br>\
that they perished: and Az says that it is not the<br>\
same as that mentioned in the Kur, and that he<br>\
knew not what is meant by عذاب يوم الصفّة: (O,<br>\
(TA:) it seems, however, that both mean the<br>\
same, as الصُّفَّةُ and الظُّلَّةُ are one in meaning.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  An appertenance of the سَرْج<br>\
[or horse&#39;s saddle]; (S, M, IAth, Mgh, O, K,<br>\
TA;) like the مِيثَرَة [q. v. in art. وثر] of the رَحْل<br>\
[or camel&#39;s saddle]; (IAth, L, TA; *) the thing<br>\
with which it is covered, between the قَرَبُوسَانِ,<br>\
which are its fore part and its hinder part:<br>\
(Mgh:) or, (M, TA,) as also of the رَحْل, (M,)<br>\
the thing that comprises within it (تَضُمُّ) the [two<br>\
pieces of wood called the] عَرْقُوَتَانِ and the [two pads,<br>\
or stuffed things, called the] بِدَادَانِ, above them and<br>\
beneath them: (M, TA:) pl. صُفَفٌ (S, M, O, K)<br>\
and صِفَافٌ, the latter mentioned by Sb. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also (tropical:)  A long period (زَمَانٌ) of time. (O, K,<br>\
TA.) So in the saying, عِشْنَا صُفَّةٌ مِنَ الدَّهْرِ (tropical:)  [We<br>\
lived, or have lived, a long period of time]. (O,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  The quantity of grain that is put<br>\
upon the palm of the hand: occurring in a trad.<br>\
of Abu-d-Dardà, in the saying, أَصْبَحْتُ لَا أَمْلكُ<br>\
صُفَّةً وَلَا لُفَّةً [I became so that I possessed not the<br>\
quantity of grain that might be put on the palm<br>\
of the hand, nor a morsel of food]; اللُّفَّةُ meaning<br>\
اللُّقْمَةُ. (TA.)<br>\
صَفَفٌ A thing that a man wears beneath the<br>\
coat of mail (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K) in the day of<br>\
battle. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.)<br>\
صَفُوفٌ A she-camel that yields a row of bowls<br>\
of her milk (تَصُفُّ أَقْدَاحًا مِنْ لَبَنِهَا S, O, K) when<br>\
she is milked, (S, O,) because of the abundance of<br>\
her milk: (S, O, K:) or for which two vessels are<br>\
set side by side (يُصَفُّ), and which fills them:<br>\
(Ham p. 535:) or that sets her fore legs evenly,<br>\
side by side, (تَصُفُّ يَدَيْهَا, [see 1,]) on the occasion<br>\
of being milked. (S, M, O, K.) [See an ex. in a<br>\
verse cited voce صُوفٌ. And see also ضَفُوفٌ.]<br>\
صَفِيفٌ Flesh-meat (S, M) such as has been laid,<br>\
cut into a strip, or into strips, (صُفَّ, S, K, and<br>\
the like in the M and O, or شُرِحَ وَصُفَّ, Mgh,)<br>\
upon the live coals (S, Mgh, O, K) to broil (S,<br>\
Mgh, K) or to become thoroughly cooked, (O,) or<br>\
upon the pebbles, and then roasted, or broiled,<br>\
(M,) or in the sun, to dry: (O, K:) or flesh-meat cut into strips, or oblong pieces, and dried<br>\
in the sun, (M, * Mgh, Msb,) or, as Lth says, and<br>\
in like manner Ks, spread in the sun [to dry]:<br>\
(Mgh:) or flesh-meat cut into broad slices: (M:)<br>\
or, accord. to Khálid Ibn-Jembeh, flesh-meat cut<br>\
into slices, not in the manner of قَدِيد, but made<br>\
broad, like cakes of bread [which are generally<br>\
about a span, or somewhat less, in width, round<br>\
and flat]: (TA:) [or cut thin so as to be translucent: (see 1, latter half:)] or flesh-meat made<br>\
to boil once, and then taken up [from the fire].<br>\
(M.)<br>\
الصُّفِّيَّةُ The صُوفِيَّة: so called in relation to those<br>\
called أَهْلُ الصُّفَّةِ. (TA. (See art. صوف.])<br>\
صَافٌّ [originally صَافِفٌ, act. part. n. of صَفَّ,<br>\
q. v.]. صَافَّةٌ and [its pl.] صَوَافُّ are epithets<br>\
applied to camels [as meaning Setting their legs<br>\
in an even row], from صَفَّتْ قَوَائِمَهَا: (S, O:) [or]<br>\
صَوَافَّ (in the Kur xxii. 37, O, K) means مَصْفُوفَةً<br>\
[i. e. set in a row], (M, O, K, TA,) to be<br>\
slaughtered; (M, TA;) of the measure فَوَاعِل in<br>\
the sense of the measure مَفَاعِل [thus in the O, and<br>\
also (probably copied therefrom) in the copies of<br>\
the K; but correctly مَفَاعِيل]: or it means مُصْطَفَّةً<br>\
[i. e. standing in a row]: (O, K:) or, as related<br>\
by I &#39;Ab, it is صَوَافِنَ. (TA.) In the phrase<br>\
وَالصَّافَّاتِ صَفًّا in the Kur [xxxvii. 1], by الصَّافَّات<br>\
are meant The angels standing in ranks in<br>\
Heaven, glorifying God. (M, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied<br>\
to a bird, it means Expanding its wings and not<br>\
moving [or flapping] them [in its flight]: opposed<br>\
to دَافٌّ. (M and TA in art. دف.)<br>\
صَفْصَفٌ A level, or an even, tract of land or<br>\
ground: (S, O, Msb, K:) thus expl. by AA, and<br>\
by Mujáhid, as used in the Kur xx. 106: by<br>\
others as meaning smooth: accord. to Fr, having<br>\
in it no herbage: and accord. to IAar, bald: pl.<br>\
صَفَاصِفُ: (TA:) or أَرْضٌ صَفْصَفٌ signifies a<br>\
smooth, and level, or even, land; and so, accord.<br>\
to IJ, [the fem.] صَفْصَفَةٌ. (M.) Also, (M,) or<br>\

↓ صَفْصَافَةٌ, (O, K,) which is of the dial. of<br>\
Thakeef. (O.)<br>\
-A3-  And A certain insect (دُوَيْبَّة,<br>\
Lth, M, O), by the Persians (العَجَم) called the<br>\

another species of salix is called in Egypt صَفْصَاف<br>\
بَلَدِىّ: (Forskål, ibid; and Delile, no. 933:)] or<br>\
so in the dial. of Syria: (M, Msb:) or a kind of<br>\
