be a n. of place; (M;) and صَلْصَلَةٌ [sometimes,<br>\
or always, implies repetition, as will be shown by<br>\
what follows, or], accord. to Lth, is more intensive, or more vehement, than صَلِيلٌ: (TA:) the<br>\
former verb is said of iron [when struck with iron<br>\

follows,) meaning it made a clashing, or a ringing,<br>\
sound], as also ↓ صَلْصَلَ; (TA;) of a nail &amp;c.,<br>\

K;) which last is also said of a woman&#39;s, or<br>\
other, ornament, meaning it made a [tinkling, or<br>\
ringing,] sound; (S, K;) and of clay mixed with<br>\
sand when it has become dry [app. as meaning it<br>\
made a crackling sound when trodden upon]; (S;)<br>\

inf. n. صَلِيلٌ, The camels made a [rumbling] sound<br>\
to be heard on the occasion of drinking in consequence of their intestines&#39; having become dry:<br>\

(tropical:)  The water-skin became dry, (M, TA,) not having<br>\
any water in it, so that it was such as would<br>\
make a kind of clattering or crackling noise<br>\
(يَتَقَعْقَعُ) [when struck or shaken or bent]. (TA.)<br>\

in a verse of Zuheyr, said of a مُضْغَة [or bit of<br>\
flesh-meat that is chewed], which indicates that it<br>\
is used in relation to that which is cooked and<br>\
roasted; or, accord. to some, the verb here means<br>\
أَثْقَلَت [which has rendered heavy the eater]:<br>\
(M:) and one says also اللِّحَامُ ↓ صَلَّلَتِ [the<br>\
flesh-meats were, or became stinking (in both of<br>\
my copies of the S اللِّجَامُ is erroneously put for<br>\
اللِّحَامُ, the reading in other copies of the S and in<br>\
the O)]; the verb in this instance being with<br>\
teshdeed لِلْكَثْرَةِ [i. e. because of its relation to<br>\
many subjects, or to a pl.]. (S, O.) In the Kur<br>\
[xxxii. 9], some read أَإِذَا صَلَلْنَا فِى الْأَرْضِ, (M,<br>\
O, TA,) [instead of the common reading, which<br>\
is ضَلَلْنَا, with ض,] and some read صَلِلْنَا, (O,<br>\
TA,) which has two meanings: i. e. When we<br>\
shall have become stinking, in the earth, and altered<br>\
in ourselves and in our forms? and when we shall<br>\
have become dried up? from صَلَّةٌ meaning “ dry<br>\
ground. ” (TA.) ―<br>\

-b2-  And صَلَلْنَا<br>\

[We cleared the grain that was mixed with dust,<br>\
or earth, from the dust, or earth, by pouring<br>\
water upon it; or] we poured water upon the<br>\

its sole (see صَلَّةٌ): or, as is indicated by what<br>\
immediately precedes in the TA, he put a lining<br>\
(termed صَلَالَة) to the boot: the verb without<br>\
teshdeed (written in the O صَللْتُ) I think to be<br>\
a mistranscription, notwithstanding the inf. n.<br>\
assigned to it in the TA: general analogy is in<br>\
favour of its being with teshdeed; and it is said<br>\
that] تَصْلِيلٌ signifies The putting skin upon a<br>\
thing. (KL.)<br>\

found in the sand; when a man sees it, he ceases<br>\
not to tremble until he dies: (Har p. 102:) pl.<br>\
أَصْلَالٌ. (S, M, * O, K. *) One says, إِنَّهَا لَصِلُّ صَفًا<br>\
[lit. Verily it is a deadly serpent of smooth stones;<br>\
i. e., such as is found among smooth stones;]<br>\
meaning, an abominable serpent like the viper.<br>\
(S, O.) And إِنَّهُ لَصِلُّ أَصْلَالٍ [lit.] (assumed tropical:)  Verily he is<br>\
a serpent of serpents; thus one says of a man,<br>\
likening him to a serpent; (S, O;) meaning<br>\
cunning, or crafty, and abominable, (S, M, O, K,)<br>\
in contention, (M,) or in contention and in other<br>\
cases: (M, K:) like as one says ضِلُّ أَضْلَالٍ, and<br>\
ضِرُّ أَضْرَارٍ. (TA in art. ضر.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (tropical:)  A calamity, or misfortune; as also ↓ صَالَّةٌ. (M, K, TA.)<br>\
So the former in the saying, مُنِىَ فُلَانٌ بِصِلٍّ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Such a one was tried with a calamity]. (TA.)<br>\

ground, or land, rained upon, between two tracts<br>\
not rained upon; (O:) or simply ground, or land,<br>\
(M, K,) whatever it be; like سَاهِرَةٌ: (M:) pl. صِلَالٌ.<br>\
(M, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A sole: (K:) [ISd says,]<br>\
خُفٌّ جَيِّدُ الصَّلَّةِ means [A boot good] in respect<br>\
of the sole; which is thus called by the name of<br>\
the ground, not otherwise; in my opinion because<br>\
of its dryness, and its making a sound on the<br>\
occasion of treading. (M. [See also another explanation of this phrase in what follows.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
Skin: one says خُفٌّ جَيِّدُ الصَّلَّةِ [A boot good in<br>\
