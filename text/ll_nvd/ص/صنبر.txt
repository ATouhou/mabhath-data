صَنْبَرَتِ النَّخْلَةُ The palm-tree became<br>\
solitary, or apart from others: (M:) or became<br>\
slender in its lower part, and bared of the stumps<br>\
of its branches, and scanty in its fruit. (M, K.)<br>\
And صَنْبَرَ أَسْفَلُ النَّخْلَةِ The lower part of the<br>\
palm-tree became slender, and stripped of the<br>\
external parts [or of the stumps of the branches].<br>\
(AO, and S in art. صبر, and TA.)<br>\
صَنْبَرٌ, (K, TA,) or ↓ صُنْبُورٌ, (O,) [both probably<br>\
correct,] Anything slender and weak, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
of animals and of trees [&amp;c.]: (O, TA:) [the reg.<br>\
pl. of the former is صَنَابِرُ: and hence, app.,] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
↓ صَنَابِرُ signifies Slender arrows; (T, M;) accord.<br>\
to IAar: [ISd says,] I have not found it save on<br>\
his authority; and he has not mentioned a sing.<br>\
thereof: (M:) [but] accord. to the T, they are so<br>\
called as being likened to the صَنَابِر [a pl. of صُنْبُورٌ]<br>\
of the palm-tree: (TA:) occurring in this sense in<br>\
a verse cited voce ذِلَّةٌ. (IAar, T, M.)<br>\
صِنْبِرٌ, and صِنَبْرٌ, and الصِّنَبْرُ: see صِنَّبْرٌ.<br>\
صَنْبَرَةٌ Ground that has become rough by reason<br>\
of urine and of dung, or compacted dung, of oxen<br>\
or sheep &amp;c., (K, TA,) and the like. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
أَخَذْتُ الشَّىْءَ بِصَنْبَرَتِهِ and بِصِنْبِرَتِهِ and بِصَنْوَبِرِهِ<br>\
[which last is evidently, I think, a mistranscription<br>\
for ↓ بِصَنَوْبَرِهِ] is a saying mentioned by Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád as meaning I took the thing altogether.<br>\
(O.)<br>\
صِنَّبْرٌ, (S, in art. صبر, M, O, K,) originally<br>\
↓ صِنَبْرٌ, (O,) Cold, as a subst.; (M, O;) as also<br>\
صِنِّبْرٌ: (O:) or cold clouds: (IDrd, O:) or a cold<br>\
wind (M, K) with mist or clouds: (M:) occurring in a verse of Tarafeh with kesr to the ب:<br>\
(M:) [see also صُنْبُورٌ:] or صِنَّبِرٌ, occurring in that<br>\
verse, signifies the intense cold of winter; (S in<br>\
art. صبر;) as also ↓ صَنَابِرُ, (S, K,) of which the<br>\
sing. is ↓ صُنْبُورٌ. (TA.) On the expression of<br>\
Tarafeh, حِينَ هَاجَ الصِّنَّبِرْ, [when the cold wind,<br>\
with mist, rises,] ending a verse, IJ says that the<br>\
poet means الصِّنَّبْرُ; but requiring to make the ب<br>\
movent, he transfers to it the final vowel, as in the<br>\
phrases هٰذَا بَكُرْ and مَرَرْتُ بِبَكِرْ: he should therefore have said الصِّنَّبُرْ; but regarding the expression as meaning حِينَ هَيْجِ الصِّنَّبْرِ, he makes the<br>\
ب to be with kesr, as though he transferred to it<br>\
the kesreh of the ر: this, he adds, is more probable than the opinion that the change is merely<br>\
one of poetic necessity. (M.) For this last reason,<br>\
another poet uses the word with teshdeed to the ن<br>\
and ر, and with kesr to the ب; saying,<br>\
نُطْعِمُ الشَّحْمَ وَالسَّدِيفَ وَنَسْقِى الْ<br>\
مَحْضَ فِى الصِّنَّبِرِّ وَالصُّرَّادِ<br>\
[We give to eat fat and the hump of the camel,<br>\
and we give to drink pure milk, in the time of<br>\
cold wind and chill mist]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also الصِّنَّبْرُ,<br>\
(M, K,) or ↓ الصِّنَبْرُ, (as in two copies of the S in<br>\
art. صبر,) and صِنَّبْرٌ, [without the article ال, occurring in a verse of which the metre requires it to be<br>\
thus written, with teshdeed to the ن,] (TA,) One,<br>\
(S,) namely, the second, (M, K,) of the days called<br>\
أَيَّامُ العَجُوزِ: (S, M, K: [see عَجُوزٌ:]) الصِّنَبْرُ [or<br>\
الصِّنَّبْرُ] and الصِّنَّبِرُ may have the same meaning,<br>\
[or meanings, or may both be applied to the day<br>\
above mentioned, for the application of صِنَّبْرٌ to<br>\
that day is certain;] poetic necessity requiring<br>\
the ب to be movent. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  صِنَّبِرٌ has also two<br>\
contr. significations, namely, Hot: and cold:<br>\
accord. to Th, on the authority of IAar. (M.)<br>\
You say غَدَاةٌ صِنَّبِرٌ, (M,) or صِنَّبْرٌ, (K,) and ↓ صِنْبِرٌ,<br>\
(as in a copy of the M,) or صِنِّبْرٌ, (K,) A cold<br>\
morning: (M, K:) and a hot morning. (K.)<br>\
صُنْبُورٌ A solitary palm-tree, apart from others,<br>\
(AO, S in art. صبر, and M, A in art. صبر, and<br>\
K,) the lower part of which becomes slender, (S<br>\
and A in art. صبر,) and stripped of the external<br>\
parts [or the stumps of the branches]: (S ubi<br>\
suprà:) and a palm-tree slender in its lower part,<br>\
and bared of the stumps of its branches, and<br>\
scanty in its fruit; (M, K;) as also ↓ صُنْبُورَةٌ:<br>\
(M:) and a palm-tree that comes forth from the<br>\
root, or lower part, of another palm-tree, without<br>\
being planted: (M:) or a little palm-tree that<br>\
does not grow from its mother-tree: (Ibn-Sim&#39;án:)<br>\
and the lowest part of a palm-tree, (AHn, Ibn-Sim&#39;án, M, K,) from which the roots branch off:<br>\
(AHn, M:) and branches that come forth from<br>\
the lowest part of a palm-tree: (M, K:) or a<br>\
branch that comes forth from the trunk of a palmtree, not from the ground: this is [said to be] the<br>\
original signification: (T, TA:) or branches that<br>\
come forth from the trunk of a palm-tree, not<br>\
having their roots in the ground: such branches<br>\
weaken the mother-tree, which is cured by pulling<br>\
them off: the pl. is صَنَابِيرُ (IAar) and ↓ صَنَابِرُ:<br>\
(T, TA:) and the صَنَابِير are also called رَوَاكِيبُ<br>\
and عِقَّانٌ. (Ibn-Sim&#39;án.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (A,) applied<br>\
to a man, Solitary; lonely: (IAar:) or solitary,<br>\

having no family nor offspring nor assistant:<br>\
(M, K:) or having no offspring, nor kinsfolk or<br>\
near relations, nor assistant, whether of strangers<br>\
or relations: and weak: (IAar:) and mean, or<br>\
ignoble. (M, K.) See also صَنْبَرٌ. And A young,<br>\
or little, (K,) or weak, (TA,) boy, or child. (K,<br>\
TA.) It was applied as an epithet to Mohammad,<br>\
by the unbelievers, as also [its dim.] ↓ صُنَيْبِيرٌ,<br>\
(M, TA,) or they called him صُنْبُورٌ, (O,) meaning<br>\
that he had no offspring nor brother, so that, when<br>\
he should die, his name would be lost; (M, TA;)<br>\
likening him to a [solitary] palm-tree, of which<br>\
the lower part had become slender, and the<br>\
branches few, and which had become dry;<br>\
(AO;) or to a branch growing from the trunk<br>\
of a palm-tree. (TA.)<br>\

صَنوْبَرٌ [The pine tree;] a certain kind of tree,<br>\
(S in art. صبر, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) well known,<br>\
from which, (Msb,) or from the roots of which,<br>\
(Mgh,) زِفْت [i. e. pitch] is obtained, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
green in winter and summer, (M,) the fruit of<br>\
which is like small لَوْز [i. e. almonds, but this is<br>\
app. a mistranscription], and the leaves whereof<br>\
are [of the kind called] هَدَب [q. v.]: (Mgh:) or<br>\
the fruit [i. e. the cone] (S, M, K) of that tree,<br>\
(S,) [i. e.] of the أَرْز; (M, K;) the trees being<br>\
called أَرْز: (M:) A&#39;Obeyd says that it signifies<br>\

fruit. (TA.)<br>\

نَخْلَةٌ مُصَنْبِرَةٌ A palm-tree that produces branches<br>\
from its trunk: such branches spoil it; for they<br>\
take the nourishment from the mother-tree, and<br>\
weaken it. (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, TA.)<br>\
