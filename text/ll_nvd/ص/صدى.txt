صَدِىَ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَصْدَى,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. صَدًى, He thirsted: (S,<br>\
M, Mgh, Msb, K:) or he thirsted vehemently.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
-A2-  صَدَا, inf. n. صَدْوٌ: see 2, in two places.<br>\
2<br>\
تَصْدِيَةٌ signifies The clapping with the<br>\
hands; syn. تَصْفِيقٌ; (S, K;) accord. to Er-Rághib, as being like the echo (الصَّدَى), inasmuch<br>\
as there is no profit in it; (TA;) or it is from<br>\
الصَّدُّ, because they [who practised it in their<br>\
worship] used to turn away (كَانُوا يَصُدُّونَ) from<br>\
El-Islám; (K;) [see more in the second paragraph<br>\
of art. صد;] and صَدْوٌ [an inf. n. of which the verb<br>\
is ↓ صَدَا] signifies the same; (K;) and so ↓ تَصَدٍّ,<br>\
of which AHeyth cites as an ex. the saying of<br>\
Hassán<br>\
صَلَاتُهُمُ التَّصَدَّى وَالمُكَآءُ<br>\
[Their prayer is the clapping with the hands, and<br>\
whistling: like the saying in the Kur viii. 35]:<br>\
(TA:) one says of a man, صدّى, (M,) or صدّى<br>\
بِيَدَيْهِ, (TA,) meaning He clapped with his<br>\
hands; (M, TA;) [said to be] originally صَدَّدَ;<br>\
(M;) and بِيَدَيْهِ ↓ صَدَا, inf. n. صَدْوٌ [mentioned<br>\
above], meaning the same. (TK.)<br>\
-A2-  also<br>\
مُصَدِّيَةٌ.<br>\
3<br>\
صاداهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُصَادَاةٌ, (S,) He imitated<br>\
him, or it; syn. عَارَضَهُ: (S, * K:) and he, or it,<br>\
corresponded, and was equal, to him, or it. (TA.)<br>\
In the Kur xxxviii. 1, some read صَادِ, with kesr,<br>\
as an imperative from المُصَادَاةُ (Bd, TA) as<br>\
meaning المُعَارَضَةُ; and hence الصَّدَى [i. e. the<br>\
echo], because it imitates (يُعَارِضُ) the first sound:<br>\
so that the meaning is, Imitate thou (عَارِض) the<br>\
Kur-án by thy works. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And] i. q. دَبَّرَهُ<br>\
[i. e. He considered, or forecast, its issues, or<br>\
results; did, performed, or executed, it with<br>\
thought, or consideration; or managed, conducted,<br>\
ordered, or regulated, it]; relating to an affair:<br>\
(M:) [or] المُصَادَاةُ signifies the turning about, or<br>\
revolving, the opinion, or idea, [that one forms]<br>\
respecting the management (تَدْبِير) of a thing,<br>\
and the doing of it: (Ham p. 35:) [or,] accord.<br>\
to As, the minding a thing attentively, carefully,<br>\
or solicitously: a man who had assisted his she-camel in her bringing forth said, بِتُّ أُصَادِيهَا طُولَ<br>\
لَيْلِى [I passed all my night minding her attentively, carefully, or solicitously]; because he disliked binding her fore shank to her arm, as it<br>\
would distress her; or leaving her, as she might<br>\
go away at random and the wolf might devour<br>\
her young one: and in like manner one says of<br>\
the pastor, يُصَادِى إِبِلَهُ [He minds attentively,<br>\
&amp;c., his camels]; when they thirst before the<br>\
completion of their usual period of being kept<br>\
from drinking, he restricts them to journeying by<br>\
night so as to arrive at water on the morrow.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He soothed, coaxed, wheedled, or<br>\
cajoled, him; or deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or outwitted, him; or strove, endeavoured, or desired, to do so: syn. دَارَاهُ, (S, M, K,<br>\
TA,) and دَاجَاهُ, and سَاتَرَهُ, (S, K, TA,) all of<br>\
which have one meaning, (TA,) [though the last<br>\
implies concealing enmity,] and لَايَنَهُ. (M.)<br>\
مَنْ صَادَاكَ فَقَدْ صَادَكَ [He who soothes thee, or<br>\
coaxes thee, surely ensnares thee] is a saying<br>\
mentioned in the A. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اصدى It (a mountain) returned an echo.<br>\
(S, * K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He (a man, TA) died; (K,<br>\
TA;) as though [meaning] his echo ceased; the<br>\
| having a privative effect. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
التَّصَدِّى, accord. to Er-Rághib, signifies<br>\
The corresponding to a thing like as does the echo<br>\
returning from the mountain. (TA.) [But<br>\
accord. to others,] تصدّى لَهُ is originally تَصَدَّدَ;<br>\
(Az and L in art. صد;) and signifies تَعَرَّضَ, (S,<br>\
M, K,) and تَضَرَّعَ. (M.) [See 5 in art. صد;<br>\
where the usages of this verb, except in the senses<br>\
mentioned and indicated here below, are fully<br>\
explained.] ―<br>\
-b2-  It signifies also The feigning oneself unmindful, negligent, inattentive, inadvertent,<br>\
inconsiderate, or heedless, not being really so.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The diverting oneself. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\

صَدًى [sometimes written صَدًا] An echo; i. e.<br>\
الصَّدَى signifies what the mountain returns to<br>\
him who utters a sound, or voice, or cry, therein;<br>\
(K;) or the sound of the mountain and the like<br>\
that responds to one; (M;) or what responds to<br>\
one with the like of his voice, or cry, in the<br>\
mountains &amp;c. (S.) One says, صَمَّ صَدَاهُ (tropical:)  [His<br>\
echo became dumb, or may his echo become dumb];<br>\
(S, TA;) meaning he perished, or may he perish:<br>\
(S and K and TA in art. صم:) and أَصَمَّ اللّٰهُ صَدَاهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [May God make his echo to return no sound];<br>\
(S, K, TA;) meaning may God destroy him: (S,<br>\
K, and TA in art. صم:) for when a man dies, the<br>\
صدى hears not from him anything, that it should<br>\
respond to him. (S. [See also another explanation of this saying in what follows.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A<br>\
sound, voice, or cry, (M, TA,) in an absolute<br>\
sense. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The part of the head,<br>\
(M,) or the part of the brain, (TA,) which is the<br>\
place [or seat] of hearing. (M, TA.) And therefore one says, أَصَمَّ اللّٰهُ صَدَاهُ [May God render<br>\
deaf the part of his brain which is the seat of<br>\
hearing]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And The brain, (M, K, TA,)<br>\
itself. (TA.) And The [entire] contents (lit. the<br>\
stuffing, حَشْو,) of the head; (M, K, TA;) also<br>\
called the هَامَة. (TA.) One says, صَدَعَ اللّٰهُ صَدَاهُ<br>\
[May God crack his brain, or the contents of his<br>\
head]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And A bird that cries in the<br>\
هَامَة [or head] of the slain when his blood has not<br>\
been avenged by retaliation: (M:) or a bird that<br>\
comes forth (M, K) from his head, (مِنْ رَأْسِهِ, M,)<br>\
or from the head of the slain, (K,) when he, or it,<br>\
has become consumed, or decayed, (M, K,) also<br>\
called the هَامَة; (M;) accord. to the assertion of<br>\
the people of the Time of Ignorance; (M, K;)<br>\
mentioned by A &#39;Obeyd; and some of them used<br>\
to say that the bones of the dead became a هَامَة,<br>\
which flew: pl. أَصْدَآءٌ: (TA:) and [this may be<br>\
meant by the saying that it signifies] the male of<br>\
the بُوم (S, M, K, TA) and هَام: pl. أَصْدَآءٌ: (M:)<br>\
they used to say that when a man was slain and<br>\
his blood was not avenged by retaliation, there<br>\
came forth from his head a bird like the بُومَة,<br>\
i. e. the هَامَة, the male being called the صدى;<br>\
and it cried upon his grave, اِسْقُونِى اِسْقُونِى [Give<br>\
ye me to drink, give ye me to drink, meaning, of<br>\
the blood of the slayer]; and if the slayer was<br>\
slain, it abstained from its crying: (TA:) and [it<br>\
is said that] it signifies also the body [itself] of a<br>\
human being after his death; (M, K;) or the<br>\
remains of the dead in his grave, i. e. his جُثَّة [or<br>\
corpse]. (Jm, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And, (K,) accord. to El-<br>\
&#39;Adebbes, (S,) [A cricket;] a certain flying<br>\
thing, that creaks by night, and hops, (S, K,)<br>\
and flies, thought by the [common] people to be<br>\
the جُنْدَب, but it is only the صدى, the جندب<br>\
being smaller than the صدى. (S. [See also<br>\
الصَّرَّارُ.]) ―<br>\
-b7-  And A certain fish, black, long, (K,<br>\
TA,) and bulky: n. un. صَدَاةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And<br>\
[A man] small, or slender, in person; (AA, M,<br>\
K, TA;) and so صَدَأْ, with ء, as mentioned by<br>\
Az. (TA. [See also صَدْعٌ and صَدَعٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b9-  And<br>\
Knowing in respect of what is conducive to the<br>\
good of cattle: (K:) or صَدَى مَالٍ means thus:<br>\
(M:) or gentle in the management of cattle; like<br>\
إِزَآءُ مَالٍ: so in the Jm: (TA:) or, as some particularly say, of camels: (M, TA:) [i. e.] you say,<br>\
إِنَّهُ لَصَدَى إِبِلٍ, meaning Verily he is knowing in<br>\
respect of camels, and of what is conducive to<br>\
their good. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Thirst: (S, M, K:) or<br>\
vehement thirst: (M:) [see the first paragraph,<br>\
in which it is mentioned as an inf. n.:] it is said<br>\
that thirst does not become vehement but the<br>\
brain dries, and therefore the skin of the forehead<br>\
of him who dies of thirst cracks. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also the next paragraph.<br>\
-A3-  And The act of the<br>\
مُتَصَدِّى, (M, K, TA,) i. e., [as is indicated in the<br>\
M,] of him who raises his head and breast,<br>\
looking towards, or regarding, a thing; and so<br>\
↓ صَدَاةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
صَدٍ and ↓ صَادٍ and ↓ صَدْيَانُ (S, M, Msb, K)<br>\
and ↓ صَدًى [which last is an inf. n. used as an<br>\
epithet] (M) Thirsting: (S, M, Msb, K:) or<br>\
thirsting vehemently: (M:) fem. [of the first]<br>\
صَدِيَةٌ (Msb) and [of the second] صَادِيَةٌ (Msb, K)<br>\
and [of the third] ↓ صَدْيَا: (S, M, Msb, K:) and<br>\
the pl. of صَادِيَةٌ is صَوَادٍ. (Ham p. 329.)<br>\
صَدَاةٌ: see صَدًى, last sentence.<br>\
صَدْيَانُ; and its fem., صَدْيَا: see صَدٍ.<br>\
صَادٍ (fem. with ة, and pl. of the latter صَوَادٍ):<br>\
see صَدٍ. ―<br>\
-b2-  As pl. of صَادِيَةٌ, (M,) صَوَادٍ signifies<br>\
[also] Tall palm-trees: (S, K:) and sometimes,<br>\
such as drink not water: (S:) or palm-trees that<br>\
drink water: [thus in a copy of the M:] and<br>\
some say, such as are tall thereof, and of other<br>\
trees. (M.)<br>\

finding nothing to indicate its meaning except<br>\
what here follows,]) the وِسَادَة [i. e. pillow, or<br>\
cushion,] with الأَرَنْدَج, meaning black lines, upon<br>\
the leather [that forms its covering]. (TA.)<br>\
