[it is said that] صَحْوٌ signifies the departing of the<br>\
clouds: (S, Mgh, K:) [but] Es-Sijistánee says<br>\
that the vulgar think it to have this meaning,<br>\
whereas it only means the dispersing of the clouds<br>\
with the departing of the cold. (Msb, TA.) And<br>\
السَّمَآءُ ↓ أَصْحَتِ The sky became cloudless. (Ks,<br>\
S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA, but not in the CK.) ―<br>\

in the soul; (K, TA;) [and also of one sleeping,<br>\
meaning he awoke: see an ex. of the former of<br>\
these two verbs in this last sense in the latter part<br>\
of the second paragraph of art. فرط.] ―<br>\
-b3-  صَحْوٌ<br>\
signifies also (tropical:)  The relinquishing of youthful folly,<br>\
and amorous dalliance, and of what is vain, or<br>\
futile. (K, TA.) Hence the saying of a poet,<br>\
صَحَا القَلْبُ عَنْ سَلْمَى وَأَقْصَرَ بَاطِلُهْ<br>\
(tropical:)  [The heart relinquished, or has relinquished,<br>\
youthful folly and amorousness by becoming rid<br>\

صَحْوٌ [an inf. n. used as an epithet, and therefore<br>\
applicable to a fem. as well as a masc. noun, and<br>\
to a dual and a pl. as well as a sing.], applied to<br>\
a day, Cloudless; (K, TA;) as also ↓ صَاحٍ; (S,<br>\
TA;) and ↓ مُصْحٍ: (Mgh, Msb:) and (K) in the<br>\
same sense applied to a sky; (Ks, S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ مُصْحِيَةٌ, or, accord. to Ks, this is<br>\
not allowable, but only صَحْوٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\

صَحْوَةٌ A state [of freedom from intoxication,<br>\
or] of sensibility, or mental perception. (TA voce<br>\

مَصْحَاةٌ is like مَسْلَاةٌ in meaning as well as in<br>\
measure, [signifying A cause of freedom,] except<br>\
that the former is from the intoxication of grief<br>\
and the latter is from distress of mind and<br>\
anxiety. (TA.)<br>\

(K,) used for drinking; (TA;) a طَاس [q. v.], or<br>\
a جَام [q. v.]: (K:) As says, “I know not of<br>\
what it is: ” (S, TA:) it is said to be of silver.<br>\
