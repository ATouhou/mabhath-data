relation to a horse, The having the thighs near<br>\
together, and the hoofs far apart, with a twisting<br>\
of the pasterns (S, O, K:) or a crookedness in<br>\

towards the off side: (ISk, S, M, Mgh, O, K:)<br>\
or an inclining of the foot (As, S, M, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K) of the fore leg or of the kind leg (As, S,<br>\
M, O, Msb) of the camel, towards the off side;<br>\
(As, S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) if towards the near<br>\

or a nearness together of [the two tendons called]<br>\
the عُجَايَتَانِ, and a wideness apart of the hoofs,<br>\
with a twisting of the pasterns; one of the natural<br>\

مُتَلَاقِيَانِ, as in the L [and M], (TA,) between<br>\
Ya-jooj and Ma-jooj: (M, L, K, TA:) and<br>\
↓ الصُّدُفَانِ, (M, K,) with damm to the د (M,)<br>\
i. e. with two dammehs, especially, (K,) or this as<br>\
well as الصَّدَفَانِ, (TA,) means the two sides of the<br>\
شِعْب [app. here meaning ravine, or gap, between<br>\
two mountains], or of the valley: (M, K, TA:)<br>\
so says IDrd: (M, TA:) both signify the two<br>\
sides of the mountain when they [meet together,<br>\
and] face each other, so called لِتَصَادُفِهِمَا, i. e.<br>\
because of their meeting together, and facing each<br>\
other, having between them a [road such as is<br>\

and in the like thereof are found pearls; (Lth,<br>\
TA;) i. q. مَحَارٌ [which means oyster-shells, and<br>\
also oysters themselves, and both of these may be<br>\
here meant, as both are correct meanings of<br>\
صَدَفٌ]: (M:) n. un. with ة: (S, M, O, Msb, K:)<br>\
[in the Msb it is also said that الصَّدَفَةُ signifies<br>\
the مَحَارَة, which is the مَحْمِل of the pilgrims;<br>\
but I think that this is a mistake, caused by<br>\
understanding مَحَارَة here in a wrong sense; for<br>\
I find no other authority for assigning this meaning to الصَّدَفَةُ:] pl. أَصْدَافٌ. (O, K.) [See an<br>\
ex. of the pl. voce حَلَزُونٌ.] ―<br>\

that head. (M, TA.) [And in like manner, The<br>\
two sockets in the scapula, in each of which turns<br>\
the head of one of the two upper arm-bones: (see<br>\
حَارِقَةٌ:) or these, it seems, are called by some<br>\
الصَّدَفَانِ; for it is said that] الصَّدَفُ signifies the<br>\
part of the scapula which is the place of the<br>\
وَابِلَة. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And صَدَفٌ also signifies<br>\
