غَدَرَهُ, (K,) and [more commonly] غَدَرَ بِهِ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
غَدِرَ (S, M, IKtt, Msb, K) and<br>\
غَدُرَ; (M, IKtt,<br>\
K;) and غَدِرَ, aor.<br>\
غَدَرَ, (Lh, K,) but ISd doubts the<br>\
correctness of this last; (TA;) inf. n. غَدْرٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) of غَدَرَ; (S, Msb, TA;) and غَدَرٌ (TA,<br>\
and so in the CK in the place of غَدْر,) and<br>\
غَدَرَانٌ, (K, TA,) which are both of غَدِرَ; (TA;)<br>\
He acted perfidiously, unfaithfully, faithlessly, or<br>\
treacherously, to him; (M, K;) he broke his compact, contract, covenant, or the like, with him;<br>\
(Msb;) he neglected the performance, or fulfilment, of his compact, &amp;c., with him: (S:) غَدْرٌ<br>\
is the contr. of وَفَآءٌ, (K,) or of وَفَآءٌ بِعَهْدٍ: (M:)<br>\
or it signifies the being remiss in a thing, and<br>\
neglecting it. (B.)<br>\
-A2-  غَدَرَ, aor.<br>\
غَدِرَ, (T, O, K,)<br>\
inf. n. غَدْرٌ, (T, O,) He drank the water of the<br>\
غَدِير [q. v.]: (T, O, K:) and, accord. to the K,<br>\
غَدِرَ, he drank the water of the sky; but this is a<br>\
sheer mistake, occasioned by a misunderstanding<br>\
of a saying in the T; here following: (TA:) Az<br>\
says that غَدَرَ meaning as expl. above should<br>\
accord. to analogy be غَدِرَ, like كَرِعَ meaning<br>\
“ he drank the كَرَع,” i. e. the water of the sky:<br>\
(O, TA:) moreover, a distinction is strangely<br>\
made in the K between the water of the غَدِير<br>\
and the water of the sky. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  غَدَرَتْ وَلَدَهَا,<br>\
said of a woman, is like دَغَرَتْهُ [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-<br>\
غَدِرَ, [aor.<br>\
غَدَرَ, inf. n. غَدَرٌ,] He remained, or lagged,<br>\
behind; as also ↓ تغدّر, accord. to As, who cites<br>\
the following verse of Imra-el-Keys:<br>\
عَشِيَّةَ جَاوَزْنَا حَمَاةَ وَسَيْرُنَا<br>\
أَخُو الجَهْدِ لَا نَلْوِى عَلَى مِنْ تَغْدَّرَا<br>\
[In the evening when we passed beyond Hamáh,<br>\
and our journeying was laborious, we not waiting<br>\
for such as lagged behind]: but accord. to one<br>\
relation it is تَعَذَّرَ, which means [the same, or]<br>\
“ held back, or withheld himself, for a cause rendering him excused. ” (TA.) You say غَدِرَ عَنْ<br>\
أَصْحَابِهِ He remained, or lagged, behind his companions. (TA.) And غَدِرَتِ النَّاقَةُ عَنِ الإِبِلِ, (S,<br>\
K,) and الشَّاةُ عَنِ الغَنَمِ, (S,) The she-camel remained, or lagged, behind the other camels, (S,<br>\
K,) not coming up to them, (TA,) and so the<br>\
sheep, or goat, behind the other sheep, or goats.<br>\
(S.) And غَدَرَ فُلَانٌ بَعْدَ إِخْوَتِهِ Such a one remained after the death of his brothers. (TA.<br>\
[But غَدَرَ, here, is app. a mistake for غَدِرَ, unless<br>\
both forms be allowable.])<br>\
-A5-  غَدِرَ اللَّيْلُ; (K;)<br>\
or غَدِرَتِ اللَّيْلَةُ, aor.<br>\
غَدَرَ, inf. n. غَدَرٌ; and ↓ أَغْدَرَت;<br>\
(S;) The night became dark: (K:) or became<br>\

in the place of pasture in the first of the growth<br>\
thereof. (K.)<br>\

with غَدَر [q. v.]. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
غدّر He cast men, or made them to fall, into<br>\
what is termed غَدَر [q. v.]; and ↓ اغدر may signify the same. (O.)<br>\
3<br>\
غادرهُ, inf. n. مُغَادَرَةٌ (S, K) and غِدَارٌ; (K;)<br>\
and ↓ اغدرهُ; (S, K;) He left him, or it; (S, K;)<br>\
he left him, or it, remaining. (K.) It is said in<br>\
the Kur xviii. 47, لَا يُغَادِرُ صَغِيرَةً وَلَا كَبِيرَةً It<br>\
will not leave, or omit, or it will not fall short of,<br>\
(TA,) a small sin nor a great sin. (Jel.) And in<br>\
a trad., يَا لَيْتَنِى غُودِرْتُ مَعَ أَصْحَابِ نُحْصِ الجَبَلِ<br>\
Would that I had [been left behind, and had] suffered martyrdom with the people of the foot of the<br>\
mountain of Ohud, who were slain there, and the<br>\
other martyrs: said by Mohammad. (A &#39;Obeyd.)<br>\
[See also a verse of &#39;Antarah cited voce مُتَرَدَّمٌ;<br>\
and another, of Kutheiyir, voce عَسْبٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  اغدر<br>\
also signifies He left behind. (TA.) You say<br>\
النَّاقَةَ ↓ اغدر, and الشَّاةَ, He (the pastor) left the<br>\
she-camel behind the other camels, and the sheep,<br>\
or goat, behind the other sheep, or goats. (S.)<br>\
And لَهُ ذٰلِكَ فِى قَلْبِى مَوَدَّةً<br>\
i. e. [Such a one aided me, and that] left remaining [in my heart a love for him]. (Lh, TA.)<br>\

استغدر It (a place) had in it pools of<br>\
water left by a torrent or torrents. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
اِسْتَغْدَرَتْ هُنَاكَ غُدُرٌ Pools of water left by a torrent<br>\
or torrents became formed there. (S.)<br>\
غَدَرٌ; pl. غُدُورٌ: see غُدْرَةٌ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] one says, أَلْقَتِ النَّاقَةُ غَدَرَهَا The she-camel cast forth what her womb had left remaining in it of blood and foul matter [after her<br>\
bringing forth]. (TA.) And أَلْقَتِ الشَّاةُ غُدُورَهَا<br>\

blood and other remains in her womb after bringing forth. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فِى النَّهْرِ غَدَرٌ In the<br>\
river, or rivulet, is slime remaining when the water<br>\
has sunk into the earth. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  غَدَرٌ signifies<br>\
also A place such as is termed ظَلِف [app. as<br>\
meaning hard, and that does not show a footmark, or rugged and hard], abounding with<br>\
stones: (S, O, TA:) or a place abounding with<br>\
stones, difficult to traverse: (TA:) or any difficult<br>\
place, through which the beast can hardly, or in<br>\
nowise, pass: (K:) or soft ground, in which are<br>\
[trenches, or channels, such as are termed] لَخَاقِيق:<br>\
(TA:) or burrows, (Lh, S, K, TA,) and banks,<br>\
or ridges, worn and undermined by water, (Lh,<br>\
TA,) and uneven لَخَاقِيق in the ground: (Lh, S,<br>\
K, TA: [and the like is also said in the TA on<br>\
the authority of As:]) and stones (K, TA) with<br>\
trees; thus accord. to AZ and IKtt: (TA:) and<br>\
anything that conceals one, and obstructs his sight:<br>\
pl. أَغْدَارٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, مَا أَثْبَتَ<br>\
غَدَرَهُ, meaning مَا أَثْبَتَهُ فِى الغَدَرِ [How firm is<br>\
he in traversing the rugged and hard and stony<br>\
place! &amp;c.]: this is said of the horse: and also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  of the man when his tongue is firm in the place<br>\
of slipping and of contention or litigation: (S,<br>\
TA:) or, accord. to Lh, it means (assumed tropical:)  how firm,<br>\
or valid, is his argument, or plea, and how seldom<br>\
does harm in consequence of slipping and stumbling befall him! or, accord. to Ks, how firm is<br>\
what remains of his intellect or understanding!<br>\
but ISd says that this explanation did not please<br>\
him. (TA.) And فَرَسٌ ثَبْتُ الغَدَرِ A horse firm,<br>\
or steady, in the place of slipping. (Ibn-Buzurj,<br>\
TA.) And رَجُلٌ ثَبْتُ الغَدَرِ (tropical:)  A man firm, or<br>\

altercation or disputation, or in speech, (S accord.<br>\
to different copies,) or and in altercation or disputation, (K, TA,) and in speech; (TA;) and<br>\
also in everything that he commences. (K, TA.)<br>\
And accord. to Ibn-Buzurj one says, إِنَّهُ لَثَبْتُ<br>\
الغَدَرِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Verily he is strong in talking<br>\
or discoursing, with men, and in contending, or<br>\
disputing, with them. (L.) [See also ثَبْتٌ.]<br>\

intensely-dark night, (S,) in which the darkness<br>\
confines men in their places of alighting or abode,<br>\
and their shelter, so that they remain behind: or,<br>\
as some say, such a night is termed ↓ مُغْدِرَةٌ because it casts him who goes forth therein into the<br>\
غدر [i. e. غَدَر]. (L, TA.)<br>\
غُدَرُ and غُدَرٌ: see غَادِرٌ, in six places:<br>\
-A2-  and<br>\
for غُدَرٌ, see also غَدِيرٌ.<br>\
غَدْرَةٌ [an inf. n. un., signifying An act of perfidy. unfaithfulness, faithlessness, or treachery]:<br>\

A portion that is left, or left remaining, of a thing;<br>\

that of ↓ غَدَرٌ is غُدُورٌ. (TA.) You say, عَلَى<br>\
مِنَ الصَّدَقَةِ ↓ فُلَانٍ غِدَرٌ Such a one owes arrears<br>\
of the poor-rate. (ISk.) And عَلَى بَنِى فُلَانٍ<br>\
مِنَ الصَّدَقَةِ ↓ غَدَرَةٌ and ↓ غَدَرٌ The sons of such<br>\

And مِنْ مَرَضٍ ↓ بِهِ غَادِرٌ In him is a relic of<br>\

غِدْرَةٌ, and the pl. غِدَرٌ: see غُدْرَةٌ, in three places.<br>\
غَدَرَةٌ: see غُدْرَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
غِدَرَةٌ, and the pl. غِدَرٌ: see غُدْرَةٌ, in three places.<br>\

kind termed غَدَر. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\
غَدَارِ: see غَادِرٌ.<br>\
غَدُورٌ: see غَادِرٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also A she-camel that remains, or lags, behind the other<br>\
camels: (K, TA:) in some of the copies of the<br>\
K غَدُورَةٌ, with ة; but the former is the right.<br>\
(TA.) And غَبِرَةٌ غَمْرَةٌ ↓ نَاقَةٌ غَدِرَةٌ A she-camel<br>\
that remains, or lags, behind the other camels, in<br>\
being driven. (Lh.)<br>\
غَدِيرٌ A pool of water left by a torrent:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S, M, K:) of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the<br>\
sense of the measure مُفَاعِلٌ, from غَادَرهُ, or مُفْعَلٌ,<br>\
from أَغْدَرَهُ; or, as some say, of the measure فَعِيلٌ<br>\
in the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ; (S;) because<br>\
it is unfaithful to those who come to it to water,<br>\
failing when much wanted: (S, * TA:) but it is<br>\
a subst.; [not an epithet; or an epithet in which<br>\
the quality of a subst. predominates, and only<br>\
used as a subst.:] you do not say هٰذَا مَآءٌ غَدِيرٌ:<br>\
(Lh:) or a place in which rain-water stagnates,<br>\
whether small or large, not remaining until the<br>\
summer: (Lth:) or a river: (Msb:) [but this<br>\
is extr.:] pl. [of pauc. أَغْدِرَةٌ, (occurring in a verse<br>\
cited voce إِلَّا, &amp;c.,) and of mult.] غُدْرَانٌ (S, Msb,<br>\
K, TA) and غُدُرٌ (S, Nh, L, TA,) which last is<br>\
sometimes contracted into غُدْرٌ: (TA:) in the K,<br>\
the last pl. is said to be of the measure of<br>\
صُرَدٌ; [i. e. ↓ غُدَرٌ;] but this is inconsistent with<br>\
what is said in other lexicons, as shown above:<br>\
and it is also said in the K that غُدَرٌ signifies the<br>\
same as غَدِيرٌ, in the sense first given above; but<br>\
it appears that this is a pl. of غُدْرَةٌ; and that, in<br>\
the K, we should read, for وَالغَدِيرُ, كَالغَدِيرِ, and<br>\
place this before, instead of after, its explanation.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (tropical:)  A piece of herbage; (TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ غَدِيرَةٌ: pl. غُدْرَانٌ: (K, TA;) this is the<br>\
only pl. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence also, (TA,) (tropical:)  A sword;<br>\
(K, TA;) like as it is called لُجٌّ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
↓ غَدِيرَةٌ also signifies A she-camel left by the<br>\
pastor (S, K) behind the other camels; and in like<br>\
manner, a sheep, or goat. (S.)<br>\
غُدَارَةٌ or غِدَارَةٌ: see غُدْرَةٌ.<br>\
غَدِيرَةٌ: see غَدِيرٌ, last two sentences.<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
A portion, or lock, or plaited lock, of hair, hanging from the head; syn. ذُؤَابَةٌ: (S, K:) accord.<br>\
to Lth, every عَقِيصَة is a غَدِيرَة; and the غَدِيرَتَانِ<br>\
are the two portions, or locks, or plaited locks, of<br>\
hair (ذَؤَابَتَانِ) which fall upon the breast: (TA:)<br>\
pl. غَدَائِرُ: (S, K:) or غدائر pertain to women,<br>\
and are plaited; and ضَفَائِر, to men. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
غَدِيرَةُ الحَائِكِ means The hollow, in the ground,<br>\
in which the weaver puts his legs, or feet: also<br>\
called الوَهْدَةُ. (Mgh in art. وهد.)<br>\
غَدَّارٌ: see غَادِرٌ; the first and third, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
غَدِّيرٌ: see غَادِرٌ; the first and third, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
غَدَّارَةٌ: see غَادِرٌ; the first and third, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
غَادِرٌ and ↓ غُدَرٌ [respecting which see below]<br>\
(S, K) and ↓ غَدُورٌ and ↓ غَدَّارٌ and ↓ غِدِّيرٌ (K)<br>\
are epithets applied to a man [and signifying, the<br>\
first, Perfidious, unfaithful, faithless, or treacherous; or acting perfidiously, &amp;c.; and the rest,<br>\
very perfidious, &amp;c.]: (S, K:) and ↓ غَدُورٌ and<br>\
↓ غَدَّارٌ and ↓ غَدَّارَةٌ are epithets applied to a<br>\
woman [and signifying as above]: (K:) but<br>\
↓ غُدَر is mostly used in calling to a man and<br>\
reviling him: (S:) you say to a man, يَا غُذَرُ [O<br>\
very perfidious man]; (S, K;) and in like manner,<br>\
↓ يَا مَغْدَرُ, and ↓ يا مَغْدِرُ, and ↓ يَا ابْنَ مَغْدَرٍ, and<br>\
↓ يا ابن مَغْدِرٍ, all determinate; (K, TA;) and to<br>\
a woman, ↓ يا غَدَارِ, like قَطَامِ: (K:) [accord. to<br>\
some, ↓ غُدَر is only used in this manner, and is<br>\
therefore without tenween; for] it is said that<br>\
رَجُلٌ غُدَرُ is not allowable, because غُدَرُ is determinate: but Sh says رَجُلٌ غُدَرٌ, writing it, says<br>\
Az, with tenween, contr. to what Lth says; and<br>\
this is correct; a word of the measure فُعَل being<br>\
imperfectly decl. [only] when it is a determinate<br>\
subst., like عُمَرُ and زُفَرُ: and IAth says that غُدَرُ<br>\
is altered from its original form, which is غَادِرٌ, for<br>\
the sake of intensiveness: (TA:) in the pl. [sense]<br>\
you say يَالَ غُدَرَ, (S,) or يَا لَغُدَرَ, [for يَا آلَ غُدَرَ,<br>\
(see the letter ل, and see آلٌ, in art. اول,)] like<br>\
يَا لَفُجَرَ. (TA.) It is said in a trad., ↓ يَا غُدَرُ<br>\
↓ أَلَسْتُ أَسْعَى فِى غَدْرَتِكَ [app. meaning, O thou<br>\
very perfidious: am I not striving, or labouring,<br>\
in respect of thine act of perfidy, to rectify it?].<br>\
(S: but in one copy, غُدْرَتِكَ.) And in another<br>\
trad., relating to El-Hodeybiyeh, وَهَلْ ↓ يَا غُدَرُ<br>\
إِلَّا بِالْأَمْسِ ↓ غَسَلْتَ غَدْرَتَكَ [O thou very perfidious: and didst thou wash away thine act of perfidy<br>\
save yesterday?]: said by &#39;Orweh Ibn-Mes&#39;ood<br>\
to El-Mugheereh. (TA.) And in another trad.,<br>\
↓ اِجْلِسْ غُدَرُ [Sit thou, O very perfidious]; for<br>\
يَا غُدَرُ: said by &#39;Áïsheh to El-Kásim. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] ↓ سِنُونَ غَدَّارَةٌ (tropical:)  Years in which is much<br>\
rain and little herbage; from [the inf. n.] الغَدْرُ;<br>\
i. e. that excite people&#39;s eager desire for abundance<br>\
of herbage, by the rain, and then fail to fulfil<br>\
their promise. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And ↓ غَدِرٌ is app.<br>\
syn. with غَادِرٌ; for] غَدِرَةٌ occurs in a trad. applied<br>\
to land (أَرْض), as though meaning (assumed tropical:)  Not producing herbage bountifully; or giving growth to<br>\
herbage, and then soon becoming blighted, or<br>\
blasted; wherefore it is likened to the غَادِر, who<br>\
acts unfaithfully. (TA.)<br>\
