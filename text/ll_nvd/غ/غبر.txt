lasted, or continued: (S, Msb, TA:) and (Msb)<br>\
he (a man, JK) tarried, stayed, or waited. (JK,<br>\
Zbd, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He, or it, passed, passed<br>\
away, or went away. (Msb, K.) It is sometimes<br>\
used in this latter sense; (Msb;) and thus it has<br>\
two contr. significations. (Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And It<br>\
was future. (KL.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 9.<br>\
-A3-  غَبِرَ: see 5,<br>\
last two sentences. ―<br>\

غَبَرَ, (S,<br>\
K,) inf. n. غَبَرٌ, (S,) said of a wound, (S, K,) It<br>\
was, or became, in a corrupt state: (K:) or it<br>\
became in a healing state, and then became recrudescent: (S:) or it was always recrudescent: and<br>\
it became in a healing state upon, or over, corruptness: (IKtt, TA:) or it healed externally while in<br>\
a withering state internally. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,<br>\
perhaps,] غَبِرَ said of a man, (assumed tropical:)  He bore rancour,<br>\
malevolence, malice, or spite; or hid enmity, or<br>\
violent hatred, in his heart. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
غبّر النَّاقَةَ: see 5. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app., as inf. n. of<br>\
the pass. verb,] التَّغْبِيرُ signifies The milk&#39;s becoming drawn up or withdrawn [from the udder].<br>\

sprinkled, him, or it, with dust. (K.) ―<br>\

also A reciting of poetry, or verses, in the praising,<br>\
or glorifying, of God, in which the performers trill,<br>\
or quaver, and prolong, the voice; whence the<br>\
epithet مُغَبِّرَة; as though the persons thus called,<br>\
being affected with a lively emotion, danced, and<br>\
raised the dust: thus accord. to Lth: (TA:) or<br>\
the saying لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ, (IDrd, IKtt, K, TA,) in<br>\
the praising, or glorifying, of God: (K, TA:) or<br>\
it signifies, (IDrd, TA,) or signifies also, (IKtt,<br>\
K, TA,) the reiterating the voice in reciting [the<br>\
Kur-án] &amp;c. (IDrd, IKtt, K, TA) Esh-Shá-<br>\
fi&#39;ee is related to have said that, in his opinion,<br>\
this تَغْبِير was instituted by the زَنَادِقَة [pl. of<br>\
زِنْدِيقٌ, q. v.], in order that they might turn away<br>\
[others thereby] from the [simple] praising, or<br>\
glorifying, of God, and from the reciting of the<br>\
Kur-án. (Az, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  غبّر ضَيْفَهُ, inf. n. as above,<br>\
He gave his guest, to eat, غُبْرَان [meaning dates<br>\
thus termed]: (TA:) the verb thus used is like<br>\

غَبَرٌ. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اغبر He (a man) raised the dust; (S, Msb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ غبّر, (S, K,) inf. n. تَغْبِيرٌ. (S.)<br>\
[Hence,] فِى وَجْهِهِ ↓ غَبَّرَ [so, evidently, but written<br>\
in the TA without any syll. signs, lit. He raised<br>\
the dust in his face; meaning,] (assumed tropical:)  he outwent him;<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  And اغبر فِى طَلَبِ الحَاجَةِ (assumed tropical:)  He strove,<br>\
laboured, exerted himself, or employed himself<br>\
vigorously or diligently, in seeking after the thing<br>\
that he wanted; (ISk, S, K;) he hasted, made<br>\

تغبّر النَّاقَةَ He milked the camel, drawing<br>\
what remained in her udder; (Z, Sgh, K, TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ غَبَّرَهَا. (Ham p. 527.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the<br>\
following saying, of a people who had increased<br>\
and multiplied, on their being asked how it was<br>\
that they had increased: كُنَّا لَا نَلْتَبِئُ الصَّغِيرَ وَلَا<br>\
نَتَغَبَّرُ الكَبِيرَ (assumed tropical:)  We used not to take the first seed of<br>\
the young, nor the remainder of the seed of the old;<br>\
meaning the marrying them, from eagerness to<br>\

clauses, and نَلْتَبِسُ is put by mistake for نَلْتَبِئُ.])<br>\

-b3-  And hence, (TA,) تغبّر مِنَ<br>\
المَرْأَةِ وَلَدً (S, K) (assumed tropical:)  He got offspring from the<br>\
woman [she being old]. (K.) It is related that a<br>\
certain man, (S, K, TA,) an Arab of the desert,<br>\

in the Genealogies of Ibn-El-Kelbee, Ghanm<br>\

son of Kaab the son of Bekr the son of Yeshkur<br>\
the son of Wáïl, (TA,) married a woman advanced<br>\
in age, (S, Z,) Rakáshi the daughter of &#39;Ámir, (K,)<br>\
and it was said to him, “She is old: ” (S, * K, *<br>\
TA:) whereupon he said, لَعَلِّى أَتَغَبَّرُ مِنْهَا وَلَدًا<br>\
(S, K) May-be I shall get from her offspring:<br>\
(TA:) and when a son was born to him, he<br>\
named him غُبَرُ, (S, K,) like غُمَرُ; (S;) and he<br>\
became the father of a tribe. (TA.)<br>\

the blood of the menses, (K,) and of milk in the<br>\
udder: (S, K:) as also ↓ غُبَّرٌ: (Msb, K:) or<br>\
↓ غُبَّرٌ is a pl. of غُبْرٌ: [but if so it is extr.:] (TA:)<br>\
or the pl. of غُبْرٌ is أَغْبَارٌ: (S, K:) and ↓ غُبَّرٌ is pl.<br>\
of ↓ غَابِرٌ [used as an epithet in which the quality<br>\
of a subst. is predominant]; (A&#39;Obeyd, TA;)<br>\
and signifies remains, &amp;c.: (A&#39;Obeyd, S, TA:)<br>\
and ↓ غُبَّرَاتٌ is a pl. pl.; i. e., pl. of ↓ غُبَّرٌ.<br>\

الكِتَابِ, accord. to different relations, i. e. And<br>\

the phrase جُرْحٌ غَبِرٌ [q. v.], TA) means A calamity, or misfortune, (JK, S, K,) of great magnitude, (S,) which, (JK, S,) or the like whereof, (K,)<br>\

(K, TA;) whence the saying, mentioned by AZ,<br>\

-b4-  صَمَّآءُ الغَبَرِ, occurring in a verse of El-<br>\
Hirmázee in praise of El-Mundhir Ibn-Járood,<br>\
to whom it is applied, is expl. by Z as meaning<br>\

(O:) it is the same as is mentioned in an earlier<br>\
part of this art. in the K by the name of ↓ غُبْرُون,<br>\
which is a mistranscription. (TA.)<br>\
غُبْرُونٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\

upon it; meaning, it (a phrase or the like) is<br>\
clear, or perspicuous, or free from obscurity; like<br>\

IAmb, Mgh;) or ذَاهِبٌ: (K:) so accord. to<br>\
some of the lexicologists: (Az:) or so used sometimes, as, for instance, by the poet El-Aashà:<br>\

passest away to-morrow, but thy fame remaineth<br>\

from their homes: (TA:) or strangers, (K,) or<br>\
persons, (TA,) who assemble together for [the<br>\
