غ<br>\
The nineteenth letter of the alphabet: called غَيْنٌ.<br>\
It is one of the letters termed حَلْقِيَّة [or faucial],<br>\
(L, TA,) its place of utterance being the upper<br>\
part of the fauces, near to that of ح, (TA in art.<br>\
غين,) the same place as that of خ, (L, TA,)<br>\
[from which it differs in being pronounced with<br>\
the voice, for] it is of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة<br>\
[or vocal], (L, TA, and K in art. غين,) and of<br>\
those that are termed مُسْتَعْلِيَة [q. v.]; one should<br>\
not reiterate the voice in uttering it, so as to exceed what is right, nor neglect exactness in respect<br>\
of its place of utterance, so as to render it obscure,<br>\
but should make it thoroughly distinct, and clear:<br>\
it is not an augmentative letter: and [it is said<br>\
that] it is not substituted [for another letter]:<br>\
(K in art. غين:) [but this is a mistake; for] it<br>\
is substituted for two letters; for خ, in غَطَرَ بِيَدِهِ,<br>\
aor. يَغْطِرُ, meaning خَطَرَ, aor. يَخْطِرُ, mentioned<br>\
by IJ and several others, (MF, TA,) and in<br>\
غَطَرَ بِذَنَبِهِ for خَطَرَ; (TA in art. خطر;) and for<br>\
ع, in لَغَنَّ for لَعَنَّ, mentioned by Ibn-Umm-<br>\
Kásim and others, (MF, TA,) [and in نَشُوغٌ for<br>\
نَشُوغٌ,] and in اِرْمَغَلَّ for اِرْمَعَلَّ, and also in الغَيْنُ<br>\
as signifying “ thirst ” and “ the clouds. ” (TA<br>\
in art. غين.)<br>\
-A2-  [As a numeral, it denotes A<br>\
thousand.]<br>\
