غَلَا, aor. يَغْلُو, primarily signifies He, or it,<br>\
exceeded the proper, due, or common, limit; was<br>\
excessive, immoderate, or beyond measure; but the<br>\
inf. n. differs in different cases, as will be shown<br>\
in what follows: (Er-Rághib, TA:) it is said of<br>\
anything as meaning it exceeded, or was excessive.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say, غَلَا فِى الأَمْرِ, (S, K,) aor. as<br>\
above, (TA,) inf. n. غُلُوٌّ (S, K, TA) and غَلَانِيَةٌ;<br>\

belonging to the present art., as is said in the<br>\
TA;]) He exceeded the proper, due, or common,<br>\
limit, in the affair; was excessive, or immoderate,<br>\
therein. (S, K, TA.) And غَلَا فِى الدِّينِ, aor.<br>\
as above, inf. n. غُلُوٌّ, He acted, or behaved, with<br>\
forced hardness, or strictness, or rigour, in religion, so that he exceeded the proper, due, or<br>\
common, limit: whence the usage of the verb in<br>\
the Kur iv. 169 and v. 81: (Msb, TA:) accord.<br>\
to IAth, الغُلُوُّ فِى الدِّينِ is the investigating of the<br>\
intrinsic states, or circumstances, of things, [in<br>\
religion,] and [applying oneself to] the discovery<br>\
of their causes, and of the abstrusities relating to<br>\

to the furthest distance (S, Mgh, Msb) that he<br>\

arms with the arrow, desiring [to attain with it]<br>\
the furthest limit. (K, * TA.) And غَلَا السَّهْمُ The<br>\
arrow rose in its course, and exceeded the [usual]<br>\
limit; (K, TA;) and in like manner, الحَجَرُ the<br>\
stone. (TA.) ―<br>\

price, or rate, at which a thing was to be sold,<br>\
was, or became, high; (Mgh, Msb, TA;) or<br>\
exceeded the usual limit; (Er-Rághib, TA;) contr.<br>\
of رَخُصَ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And غَلَا بِهَا عظم [i. e. عِظَمٌ,<br>\
lit. Bigness exceeded the usual limit in her;]<br>\
meaning she became plump, or fat: (TA:) one<br>\
says, غلا بِالجَارِيَةِ عظم, and بِالغُلَامِ, [the girl, or<br>\
young woman, became plump, or fat, and the boy,<br>\
or young man,] in the case of their quickly attaining to young womanhood and young manhood.<br>\
(TA in another part of this art.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And غَلَا is<br>\
said of anything as meaning اِرْتَفَعَ [i. e. It rose in<br>\
degree; as is shown by the following ex.]: Dhur-Rummeh says,<br>\
فَمَا زَالَ يَغْلُو حُبُّ مَيَّةَ عِنْدَنَا<br>\
وَيَزْدَادُ حَتَّى لَمْ نَجِدْ مَا نَزِيدُهَا<br>\
[And the love of Meiyeh ceased not to rise in<br>\
degree with us, and to increase, so that we found<br>\

[We purchase at a high price flesh-meat, for the<br>\
guests, raw; and we make it to be low-priced<br>\

غالى فِى الصِّدَاقِ He made the dowry, or the gift<br>\
