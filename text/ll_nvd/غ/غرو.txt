smears; (Fr, K, TA;) and thus the former word<br>\
is expl. by Sh: (TA:) or a certain thing that is<br>\
extracted from fish: (K:) [and mucilage, which<br>\
by concretion becomes gum; the former word is<br>\
used in this sense in the K voce صَمْغٌ. q. v.:] and<br>\
it is said that the trees [app. that produce the<br>\
mucilage termed غِرَآء, otherwise [know not what<br>\

by one of the Kings of El-Heereh: (TA:) or two<br>\
tall buildings, said to be the tombs of Málik and<br>\
Akeel, the two cup-companions of Jedheemeh ElAbrash; thus called because En-Noamán Ibn-El-Mundhir used to smear them (كَانَ يُغَرِّيهِمَا)<br>\
with the blood of him whom he slew when he<br>\

غُرَاوَى i. q. رَغْوَةٌ [i. e. Froth]: (K, TA: [الغُراءىٰ<br>\

transposition; for رُغَاوَى has been mentioned [in<br>\
art. رغو] as syn. with رَغْوَةٌ: (TA:) pl. with fet-h<br>\

-b2-  Hence, for سَهْمٌ مَغْرُوٌّ, lit. A glued arrow,<br>\
meaning an arrow having the feathers glued upon<br>\

of what here follows.) It is said in a prov.,<br>\
أَدْرِكْنِى وَلَوْ بِأَحَدِ المُغْرُوَّيْنِ, meaning [Reach thou<br>\
me, though] with one of the two [feathered]<br>\
arrows: or, as Th says, with an arrow or with<br>\
a spear: (S:) El-Mufaddal says, there were two<br>\
brothers, of the people of Hejer, a people to<br>\
whom the Arabs ascribe stupidity, and one of<br>\
those two rode an intractable she-camel, and the<br>\
one that did not ride had with him a how, and<br>\
his name was Huneyn; so the one that was<br>\
riding called to him, and said, يَا هُنَيْنُ وَيْلَكَ<br>\
انْزِلْنِى وَلَوْ بِأَحَدِ المَغْرُوَّيْنِ, [in which انزلنى seems<br>\
to be a mistranscription for ادركنى,] meaning,<br>\
with his arrow; whereupon his brother shot at<br>\
him and laid him prostrate; and his saying<br>\
became a prov., applied on an occasion of necessity, or difficulty, and of the after failing of<br>\
stratagem. (Meyd.) One says also قَوْسٌ مَغْرُوَّةٌ<br>\
[A glued bow] (S, Msb, K) and ↓ مَغْرِيَّةٌ. (S, K.)<br>\
