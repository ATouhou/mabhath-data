غَدَفَ لَهُ فِى العَطَآءِ, (aor.<br>\
غَدُفَ, inf. n. غَدْفٌ,<br>\
TK,) He was profuse to him in giving. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اغدفت قِنَاعَهَا She (a woman, S) let down,<br>\
or let fall, her [head-covering called] قناع upon<br>\
her face. (S, K.) &#39;Antarah says,<br>\
إِنْ تُغْدِفِى دُونِى القِنَاعَ فَإِنَّنِى<br>\
طَبٌّ بِأَخْذِ الفَارِسِ المُسْتَلْئِمِ<br>\
(S,) i. e. If, O my beloved, thou let down before<br>\
me the head-covering, meaning if thou veil thyself<br>\
from me, I am expert in capturing the mail-clad<br>\
horseman: then how should I lack power to<br>\
capture thee? (EM p. 236.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اغدف<br>\
اللَّيْلُ (tropical:)  The night let down its curtains [of darkness]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And الشَّبَكَةَ عَلَى الصَّيْدِ<br>\
He (a sportsman, or fowler, or the like,) let fall<br>\
the net upon the object, or objects, to be captured.<br>\
(S, K.) Hence, (TA,) it is said in a trad., إِنَّ<br>\
قَلْبَ المُؤْمِنِ أَشَدُّ ارْتِكَاضًا مِنَ الذَّنْبِ يُصِيبُهُ مِنَ<br>\
العُصْفُورِ حِينَ يُغْدَفُ بِهِ (S, TA,) i. e. [Verily the<br>\
heart of the believer is more vehemently agitated<br>\
in consequence of the offence that he purposes than<br>\
the sparrow] when the net is made to cover it, whereupon it struggles to escape: (TA:) or مِنَ الخَطِيْئَةِ<br>\
[i. e. in consequence of the sin that he is tempted<br>\
to commit]. (So in the O, instead of مِن الذنب<br>\
يصيبه.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اغدف بِهَا (assumed tropical:)  He compressed her, (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O, K,) i. e., a woman: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O:)<br>\
or, as in the A, he went in to her. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
اغدف said of the sea [app. from the same verb<br>\
said of the night] (tropical:)  It became confusedly agitated<br>\
in its waves; expl. by the words اِعْتَكَرَتْ أَمْوَاجُهُ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  He slept. (AA, TA in art.<br>\
سدف.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And, accord. to Lh, (O,) اغدف said<br>\
of the circumciser (O, K, TA) of a boy (O)<br>\
means He cut off entirely the prepuce; (O, K,<br>\
TA;) like أَسْحَتَ; (O, TA;) but ISd holds<br>\
that the latter has this meaning, and the former<br>\
means he left somewhat thereof: (TA:) one says<br>\
to the circumciser, لَا تُغْدِفْ وَلَا تُسْحِتْ, (O, TA,)<br>\
but this means Leave not thou much of the skin,<br>\
nor cut off entirely. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اغتدف مِنْهُ He (a man, O) took from him<br>\
(another man, O) much. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And اغتدف الثَّوْبَ He cut the garment, or<br>\
piece of cloth. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
12<br>\
اِغْدَوْدَفَ It (the night) came with its darkness. (TA.)<br>\
غَدَفٌ A state of ease, and plentifulness, or ampleness: so in the saying, القَوْمُ فِى غَدَفٍ مِنْ<br>\
عَيْشِهِمْ (O, K *) or مَعِيشَتِهِمْ (TA) [The people, or<br>\
party, are in a state of ease, &amp;c., in respect of<br>\
their means of subsistence]: thus in the O and<br>\
TS: but in the L, من معيشتهم ↓ فى غُدافٍ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
غُدْفَةٌ A thing in the form of the [head-covering<br>\
called] قِنَاع, worn by the women of the Arabs of<br>\
the desert. (TA.)<br>\
غِدْفَةٌ The apparel of the king. (TA.)<br>\
غُدَافٌ The crow, (S, O, K, TA,) or, as some<br>\
say, the large crow, (TA,) of the summer, or hot<br>\
season: (S, O, K, TA:) or, accord. to some, in<br>\
an absolute sense, the crow: (TA:) or the large<br>\
crow that is full in the wings: (JK:) or the<br>\
black crow: (MA:) pl. غِدْفَانٌ. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
A vulture having abundant plumage (S, O, K) is<br>\
sometimes thus called: (S, O:) pl. as above.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Long, (S, O, K, TA,) abundant,<br>\
(TA,) black hair. (S, O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A<br>\
black wing. (S, K, TA.) And Anything intensely black is termed غُدَافٌ, and ↓ أَسْوَدُ غُدَافِىٌّ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also غَدَفٌ.<br>\
غُدَافِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مغدف, [app. مُغْدِفٌ, or perhaps taken from a<br>\
mistranscription for مُغْدِقٌ,] as an epithet applied<br>\
to means of subsistence (عَيْشٌ), signifies Smooth<br>\
and ample. (TA.) [Freytag mentions مُغَدَّفٌ<br>\
and مُغَدَّقٌ, each having the fem. with ة, as signifying Copious, applied to rain: both from the<br>\
“ Fákihet el-Khulafà,” p. 141, l. 3; where the<br>\
word is مغدقة, evidently مُغْدِقَة, and rhyming<br>\
with مُطْبِقَة.]<br>\
