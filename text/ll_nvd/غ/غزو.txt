غَزَاهُ, [aor.<br>\
غَزُوَ,] inf. n. غَزْوٌ, He willed, or<br>\
desired, it; he sought it; and he aimed at it,<br>\
intended it, or meant it; syn. أَرَادَهُ; and طَلَبَهُ;<br>\
and قَصَدَهُ; [the first of which is often used in<br>\
the same senses as the second and third;] as also<br>\
↓ اغتزاهُ; (K, TA;) this last mentioned by ISd<br>\
as syn. with قَصَدَهُ. (TA.) One says, عَرَفْتُ مَا<br>\
يُغْزَى مِنْ هٰذَا الكَلَامِ i. e. [I knew, or,<br>\
emphatically, I know,] what is willed or desired<br>\
(مَا يُرَادُ) [from this speech]. (S.) And غَزْوِى<br>\
كَذَا My aim, or intention, or meaning, is such a<br>\
thing. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] غَزَا العَدُوَّ, inf. n.<br>\
غَزْوٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and غَزَوَانٌ, (K, TA,) or,<br>\
as some say, غَزْوَانٌ, mentioned by Sb, (TA,) and<br>\
غَزَاوَةٌ, (K,) [but see what is said of this last at<br>\
the close of this paragraph,] He went forth, (Er-Rághib, TA,) or repaired, or betook himself,<br>\
(Mgh,) to wage war, (Er-Rághib, TA,) or to<br>\
fight, (Mgh,) with the enemy; (Er-Rághib, Mgh,<br>\
TA;) or he went to fight with, and plunder, the<br>\
enemy; (K, TA;) in the country of the latter.<br>\
(Msb.) [And غَزَا alone, the objective complement being understood, often signifies the same;<br>\
or He engaged in a warring, or warring and<br>\
plundering, expedition, or in such expeditions.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And غَزَا إِلَيْهِ, inf. n. as above, He tended, repaired,<br>\
betook himself, or went, to, or towards, him, or it;<br>\
syn. قَصَدَهُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  غَزَاوَةٌ, mentioned above, is<br>\
of a measure which in most instances is that of an<br>\
inf. n. of an intrans. verb, and it seems to be an<br>\
inf. n. of which the verb is غَزُوَ, meaning جَادَ غَزْوُهُ<br>\
[i. e. Excellent, or how excellent, is his engaging<br>\
in a warring, or warring and plundering, expedition, or in such expeditions!]; and to be similar<br>\
to قَضُوَ meaning جَادَ قَضَآءُهُ, and ضَرُبَتْ يَدُهُ meaning جَادَ ضَرْبُهَا. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
غَزَّوَ see what next follows.<br>\
4<br>\
اغزاهُ He fitted him out, equipped him, or<br>\
furnished him, (S,) or he sent him, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
or he urged, or incited, him, (K,) to engage in a<br>\
warring, or warring and plundering, expedition,<br>\
(S, * Mgh, * Msb, * K,) in the country of the enemy;<br>\
(Msb;) and ↓ غزّاهُ signifies the same. (K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
أَغْزَتْ, said of a woman, (Mgh, K,) Her husband<br>\
was absent [engaged in a warring, or warring<br>\
and plundering, expedition, in the country of the<br>\
enemy]; (Mgh;) or her husband went [or had<br>\
gone] to fight with, and plunder, the enemy. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And, said of a she-camel, Her impregnation<br>\
was, or became, difficult. (S, K.)<br>\
-A3-  And اغزاهُ<br>\
He granted him some delay, and deferred [the<br>\
exacting of] the debt that he owed. (S, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
اغتِزاهُ: see 1, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-  اغتزى بِفُلَانٍ<br>\
He had such a one peculiarly to himself from<br>\
among his companions: (K, TA:) like اِغْتَزَّ بِهِ.<br>\
(TA.) A poet says,<br>\
قَدْ يَغْتَزِى الهِجْرَانُ بِالتَّجَرُّمِ<br>\
[Sometimes, or often, the cutting off from friendly<br>\
intercourse has the accusation of that which is a<br>\
crime, or a fault, or an offence, peculiarly assigned<br>\
to it (as the cause)]: التجرّم here meaning اِدِّعَآءُ<br>\
الجُرْمِ. (TA.)<br>\
