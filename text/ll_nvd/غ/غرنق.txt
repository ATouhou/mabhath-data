&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
غِرْنَاقٌ: see غُرْنَيْقٌ, last sentence.<br>\
غُرْنُوقٌ is held by the author of the K to be<br>\
wrongly mentioned by J in art. غرق, on the<br>\
ground of the saying that the ن is radical; and<br>\
IJ says that Sb has mentioned غُرْنَيْقٌ among<br>\
quadriliteral-radical words: but there is a difference of opinion on this point; for AHei<br>\
asserts that the ن in غُرْنُوقٌ and in all its dial.<br>\
vars. is augmentative. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See غُرْنَيْقٌ, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also sing. of غَرَانِقُ, which signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Certain trees: (Aboo-Ziyád, O, K:) or, as also<br>\
↓ غُرَانِقٌ, sing. of غَرَانِيقُ, which signifies the tender<br>\
sprouts at the root, or lower part, of the عَوْسَج<br>\
[or box-thorn]: (AA, O, K:) likened to a tender<br>\
youth, because of their freshness and beauty:<br>\
(TA:) or غُرْنُوقٌ signifies a tender and concealed<br>\
plant; (K, TA;) or, accord. to one copy [of the<br>\
K], a tender, spreading plant: mentioned by AHn.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A lock of hair much twisted:<br>\
(Lth, O, K:) or, accord. to IAar, a forelock: so<br>\
in the phrase جَذَبَ غُرْنُوقَهُ [He pulled his forelock]: and نُغْرُوقٌ signifies the “ hair of the back<br>\
of the neck. ” (O, TA.)<br>\
غِرْنَوْقٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
غُرْنَيْقٌ (S, K) and ↓ غُرْنُوقٌ and ↓ غِرْنَوْقٌ (O, K)<br>\

stork, ardea ciconia; or, accord. to some, the black<br>\
stork, ardea nigra:] or, accord. to IAmb, the<br>\
males [or male] thereof: (TA:) or the first, (O,<br>\
K,) as also the second, (K,) signifies the كُرْكِىّ<br>\
[or Numidean crane, ardea virgo]: (As, O, K,<br>\
TA:) or a certain bird resembling this: (ISk, O,<br>\
K, TA:) pl. غَرَانِيقُ. (O, TA.) It is related of<br>\
the Prophet that [when he was reciting the words<br>\
of the Kur (liii. 19 and 20), “Have ye considered<br>\
El-Lát, and El-&#39;Ozzà, and Menáh, the other<br>\
third? ”] the Devil put into his mouth the saying تِلْكَ الغَرَانِيقُ العُلَى [Those are the most high<br>\
غرانيق, as though meaning cranes, for the Numidian crane is remarkable in the East for its<br>\
superlatively-high flight]; referring, as IAar<br>\
says, to the idols, which were asserted to be<br>\
intercessors with God, wherefore they are likened<br>\
to the birds that rise high into the sky: (O, TA: *)<br>\
or غرانيق may in this case be a pl. of one of the<br>\
sings. expl. in what here follows [but applied to<br>\
females]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  غُرْنَيْقٌ (O, K, TA, and so in<br>\
copies of the S) and ↓ غِرْنَيْقٌ (IJ, TA, and so in<br>\

beautiful hair, and comely: (TA:) pl. غَرَانِيقُ and<br>\
غَرَانِقَةٌ (S, O, K) and غَرَانِقُ, (S, K,) which last<br>\
may be pl. of غُرَانِقٌ, agreeably with analogy,<br>\
(IAmb, TA,) or it may be a contraction of<br>\
غَرَانِيقُ, as such used by a poet. (TA.)<br>\
غِرْنَيْقٌ and غِرْنِيْقٌ: see the next preceding sentence.<br>\
غُرَانِقٌ, applied to a youth, (K, TA,) and to<br>\
