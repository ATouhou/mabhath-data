غَاضَ, aor. يَغِيضُ, inf. n. غَيْضٌ (S, A, Msb,<br>\
K) and مَغَاضٌ (Msb, K) and مَغِيضٌ, (TA,) It<br>\
(water) became scanty, or little in quantity, and<br>\
sank into the earth, or disappeared in the earth:<br>\
(S, and so in some copies of the K:) or became<br>\
scanty, or little in quantity, and decreased, or<br>\
diminished, or became deficient: (A, and so in<br>\
some copies of the K:) or sank into the earth,<br>\
and went away: (TA:) or went away into the<br>\
earth; (Msb;) [contr. of فَاضَ, aor. يَفِيضُ;] as<br>\
also ↓ انغاض, (S, K,) which is of the dial. of El-<br>\
Hijáz. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It (a thing, Msb, a flow of<br>\
milk, TA, and (assumed tropical:)  the price of a commodity, S,<br>\
Msb, K) decreased, or diminished, or became<br>\
deficient. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  وَمَا تَغِيضُ الْأَرْحَامُ وَمَا<br>\
تَزْدَادُ, (S, * K, * TA,) in the Kur [xiii. 9], (S,)<br>\
means And the wombs&#39; falling short [of completion<br>\
or of what is usual], (Akh, S, Bd,) and their<br>\
exceeding [therein], in respect of the body [of the<br>\
fœtus], and the period of gestation, and the<br>\
number borne: (Bd:) or, as some say, in respect<br>\
of the menstrual blood: (Bd:) or the wombs&#39;<br>\
falling short of the nine months (Zj, O, L, and so<br>\
in copies of the K, but in others seven months,) of<br>\
gestation, and their exceeding the nine [or seven]<br>\
months: (Zj, O, L:) or the wombs&#39; falling short<br>\
of completion, so that the fœtus dies, and their<br>\
exceeding so that the gestation becomes complete:<br>\
and accord. to this explanation, the reading of<br>\
seven months in the K may be correct: see also<br>\
Katádeh&#39;s explanation of غَيْضٌ, below, which<br>\
favours this reading. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  You say also,<br>\
غَاضَ الكِرَامُ وَفَاضَ اللِّئَامُ (S, A) (tropical:)  The generous<br>\
became few, (S, TA,) and failed, or perished,<br>\
(TA,) and the mean became many. (S.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
غَاضَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. as above, inf. n. غَيْضٌ,<br>\
(TA,) He (God, S, Msb) made it (i. e. water)<br>\
to become scanty, or little in quantity, and to<br>\
sink into the earth, or disappear in the earth:<br>\
(S:) or made it to decrease, or diminish, or become deficient: (K:) or made it to go away into<br>\
the earth: (Msb:) and ↓ اغاضهُ signifies the<br>\
same; (S, A, K;) and so does ↓ غيّضهُ, inf. n.<br>\
تَغْيِيضٌ: (TA:) thus the first of these verbs is<br>\
trans. as well as intrans. (S.) [It is said in the<br>\
Kur xi. 46,] وَغِيضَ الْمَآءُ (S, A) And the water<br>\
was made to become scanty, &amp;c.: (S:) or was<br>\
made to decrease, or diminish. (A, * Bd.) And<br>\
hence the saying of &#39;Áïsheh, describing her father,<br>\
وَغَاضَ نَبْعَ الرِّدَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  And he did away with what<br>\
appeared of apostacy. (TA.) You say also,<br>\
دَمْعَهُ ↓ غيّض, (S, * K,) inf. n. as above, (K,) He<br>\
made his tears to diminish, (S, K,) and restrained<br>\
them: (S:) or he took the tears from his eye and<br>\
dashed them away. (Th.) A poet says, (TA,)<br>\
namely, Jereer, (O and TA in art. غبض,)<br>\
مِنْ عَبَرَاتِهِنَّ وَقُلْنَ لِى ↓ غَيَّضْنَ<br>\
مَا ذَا لَقِيتَ مِنَ الهَوَى وَلَقِينَا<br>\
meaning They made their tears to flow until they<br>\
exhausted them [and they said to me, What is it<br>\
that thou hast experienced, of love, and we have<br>\
experienced?]: ISd says that من here denotes<br>\
some; or it may be redundant, accord. to the<br>\
opinion of Abu-l-Hasan; for he holds that it<br>\
may be so in affirmative [as well as negative]<br>\
phrases, mentioning, as an instance, قَدْ كَانَ مِنْ<br>\
مَطَرٍ, meaning قَدْ كَانَ مَطَرٌ. (TA.) One relation of this verse gives غَبَّضْنَ; but the former<br>\
is the right. (O and TA in art. غبض.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
He opened a way, passage, or channel, for it<br>\
(namely water) to flow forth to a مَغِيض [q. v.].<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  He diminished it, namely the price<br>\
of a commodity; (Ks, S, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ اغاضهُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And He caused him to suffer<br>\
loss, or detriment; and wronged, or injured, him.<br>\
(ISd, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
غيّضهُ: see 1, latter half, in three places.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
غيّض said of a lion He frequented, or kept to, the<br>\
غَيْضَة [q. v.]. (S, Sgh, L, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اغاضهُ: see 1, latter half, in two places.<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْغَيَضَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
غَيْضٌ An abortive fœtus, not completely<br>\
formed; (Katádeh, K;) i. e. less than seven months<br>\
old. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  (tropical:)  Little; or a small quantity: as in<br>\
the saying, or in أَعْطَاهُ غَيْضًا مِنْ فَيْضٍ (tropical:)  He gave<br>\
him little from much. (S, A, K.)<br>\
-A3-  An abundance of the trees called أَعْلَاث; i. e. طَرْفَآء and<br>\
أَثْل and حَاج and عِكْرِش and يَنْبُوت. (TA.) [See<br>\
also غَيْضَةٌ.]<br>\
غِيضٌ The طَلْع [or spadix of a palm-tree];<br>\
(IAar, IDrd, O, K, TA;) like غَضِيضٌ and<br>\
إِغْرِيضٌ: (TA:) or the عَجَم (AA, O, K) [thus<br>\
correctly (in the CK عُجْم) evidently, I think,<br>\
here meaning the heart (commonly called جُمَّار<br>\
q. v.) of the palm-tree (the only produce that is<br>\
eaten except the dates)] that comes forth, or<br>\
coming forth, (K,) or that has not come forth,<br>\
(O,) from [amid] its [membranous fibres termed]<br>\
لِيف [q. v.], and all of which is eaten. (AA,<br>\
O, K.)<br>\
غَيْضَةٌ A thicket; syn. أَجَمَةٌ; i. e. a collection<br>\
of tangled, or confused, or dense, trees: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) or an أَجَمَة; i. e. a ↓ مَغِيض [q. v.] of<br>\
water collected together, in which, in consequence<br>\
thereof, trees grow: (S:) or an أَجَمَة: and a<br>\
place in which is a collection of trees in a مَغِيض<br>\
of water: (K:) or particularly, of [trees of the<br>\
willow-kind called] غَرَب; not of all trees; (AHn,<br>\
O, K;) accord. to the first Arabs of the desert;<br>\
but this is at variance with what we find in the<br>\
poems of the Arabs; for Ru-beh, for instance,<br>\
makes it to consist of fruit-bearing trees and trees<br>\
not fruit-bearing, and makes it to be a غَابَة:<br>\
(AHn, O:) [see also غَيْنَةٌ:] pl. [of pauc.] أَغْيَاضٌ<br>\
(S, K) and [of mult.] غِيَاضٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K)<br>\
and غَيْضَاتٌ: (Msb:) the first of these being<br>\
formed with disregard of the augmentative [ة];<br>\
not being a pl. pl., for this is not so formed:<br>\
(TA:) any غَرَب in Nejd adjacent to the غَرَب<br>\
of the cultivated lands, when they are collected<br>\
therein, are termed غِيَاض. (O, TA.) [See also<br>\
غَيْضٌ.]<br>\
غَائِض as used in the following verse,<br>\
إِلَى اللّٰهِ أَشْكُو مِنْ خَلِيلٍ أَوَدُّهُ<br>\
ثَلَاثَ خِلَالٍ كُلُّهَا لِىَ غَائِضُ<br>\
is said by some to mean غَائِظ, the ض being substituted for ظ; [so that the verse should be<br>\
rendered, To God I complain of three qualities,<br>\
or habits, of a friend whom I love, every one of<br>\
which is to me such as angers;] thus says IJ:<br>\
but ISd says that it may be without substitution,<br>\
from غَاضَهُ as expl. in the last sentence of the first<br>\
paragraph of this art.; and thus the meaning<br>\
may be, such as causes me to suffer loss, or<br>\
detriment, and such as wrongs, or injures, me.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَغِيضٌ is an inf. n. (TA. [See 1, first sentence.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And also the pass. part. n. of غَاضَهُ;<br>\
applied to water. (Msb, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  And a n. of<br>\
place, signifying A place where water sinks, or<br>\
goes away, into the earth: (Msb, TA:) or مَغِيضُ مَآءٍ<br>\
signifies a place where water enters [into the<br>\
earth]: and a place where water collects: (Mgh:)<br>\
see also غَيْضَةٌ: pl. مَغَايِضُ. (Mgh.)<br>\
