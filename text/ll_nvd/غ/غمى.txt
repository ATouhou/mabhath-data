غَمْىٌ, (TA,) I roofed the house, or chamber: (K,<br>\
TA:) or covered its roof (S, K) with earth &amp;c.<br>\
(K) or with reeds, or canes, and earth, and the<br>\
like: (S:) and ↓ غَمَّيْتُهُ signifies the same: (K:)<br>\
and غَمَا البَيْتَ, aor. يَغْمُوهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. غَمْوٌ,<br>\
(TA,) signifies he covered [the roof of] the house,<br>\
or chamber, [in like manner, or] with clay, or<br>\
earth, and wood. (K, TA.) And غَمَىِ الشَّىْءَ<br>\
He covered the thing. (Har p. 422.) ―<br>\
-b2-  غُمِىَ<br>\
اليَوْمُ, and اللَّيْلُ, The day, and the night, was<br>\
constantly clouded, so that the sun was not seen<br>\
therein nor the new moon: so accord. to Es-Sara-<br>\
kustee: and he says that عَلَيْكُمْ ↓ فَإِنْ أُغْمِىَ<br>\
means And if your day be constantly clouded, so<br>\
that ye see not the new moon, then complete ye<br>\
[the reckoning of the days of] Shaabán: (Msb:)<br>\
or فَإِنْ غُمَّ عَلَيْكُمْ and غُمِىَ and ↓ أُغْمِىَ, thus differently related, all mean, and if it, i. e. the new<br>\
moon, be covered, or concealed: or and if there<br>\
be a covering [of clouds] over you: (Mgh:) [see<br>\
also 1 in art. غم:] or يَوْمُنَا ↓ أُغْمِىَ means Our<br>\
day was one whereof the covering of clouds was<br>\
constant: and لَيْلَتُنَا ↓ أُغْمِيَتْ, Our night was one<br>\
whereof the new moon was veiled, or concealed.<br>\

أَغْمَىَ see 1, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also,<br>\
أُغْمِىَ عَلَيْهِ الخَبَرُ The information, or narration,<br>\
was dubious, confused, or vague, to him; such as<br>\
was difficult to be understood; or such as was not<br>\
to be understood; like غُمَّ: (S:) or was obscure,<br>\
or unapparent, to him. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And أُغْمِىَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِغْمَآءٌ; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) and عليه ↓ غُمِىَ; (S, Msb, K;) said of a<br>\
sick man, (S, Msb, K,) He swooned, i. e. became<br>\
senseless, (غُشِىَ عَلَيْهِ, S, * K,) and then recovered<br>\
his senses: (K:) or إِغْمَآءٌ is a weakness of the<br>\
faculties by reason of the overpowering effect of<br>\
disease: (Mgh:) or it is an abstraction, or<br>\
absence of mind, that overtakes a man, with<br>\
languor of the limbs, or members, or organs, by<br>\
reason of a malady; (Mgh, Msb;) thus it is<br>\
defined by the scholastic theologians; and is the<br>\
same as غُشْىٌ: (Mgh:) or it is a repletion of the<br>\
venters of the brain with a cold, thick, phlegm;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb;) thus accord. to the physicians, who<br>\
distinguish between it and غُشْىٌ, as do the lawyers: (Mgh:) [see also غُشِىَ عَلَيْهِ:] the patient<br>\
is said to be عَلَيْهِ ↓ مُغْمًى, (S, Mgh, and so in<br>\
some copies of the K,) and عَلَيْهِ ↓ مَغْمِىٌّ, (S, Msb,<br>\
and so in some copies of the K,) and ↓ غَمًى, which<br>\
last epithet is applied to a single person, (S, K,)<br>\
and to two persons, (S,) and to a pl. number, (S,<br>\
K,) and to a female [as well as a male], (S,) or<br>\
(if you will, S) you say هُمَا غَمَيَانِ and هُمْ أَغْمَآءٌ.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
فِى السَّمَآءِ غَمْىٌ, (K,) or كَانَ عَلَى السَّمَآءِ غَمْىٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) and ↓ غَمًى, (Msb, K,) mean [Upon the<br>\
sky is, or was,] what veiled, or concealed, the new<br>\
moon: (Msb, K:) not from غُمَّ: (K:) this addition in the K is meant as an indirect slur upon<br>\
J, for his having mentioned [in this art.] the<br>\
statement of Fr that one says صُمْنَا لِلْغُمَّى and<br>\
لِلْغَمَّى, meaning We fasted when the new moon<br>\
was veiled, or concealed, to us; and هِىَ لَيْلَةُ الغَمَّى<br>\
[or الغُمَّى]; the [proper] place of which is [the<br>\
section of words whereof the last radical is] م:<br>\
(TA:) [see غَمٌّ, in that art.: but accord. to Fei,]<br>\
one says [also], ↓ صُمْنَا لِلْغُمْيَةِ. (Msb. [It is<br>\
there added that this noun is like مُدْيَة in<br>\
measure: otherwise I should think that the right<br>\
reading is لِلْغُمِّيَّة, which has been mentioned voce<br>\
غَمٌّ.])<br>\
غَمًى and ↓ غِمَآءٌ (T, S, K) The roof of a house,<br>\
or chamber: (T, K:) or the covering of the roof,<br>\
(S, K,) consisting of earth &amp;c., (K,) or consisting<br>\
of reeds, or canes, and earth, and the like; (S;)<br>\
and غَمًا also signifies [the same, or] the covering<br>\
of a house, or chamber, consisting of clay, or<br>\
earth, and wood: (TA in art. غمو:) the dual [of<br>\
the first and last] is غَمَيَانِ and غَمَوَانِ: and the<br>\
pl. is أَغْمَآءٌ, (K, TA,) which is [of the same] like<br>\
أَنْقَآءٌ pl. of نَقًى [and نَقًا], (TA,) and أَغْمِيَةٌ, (K,<br>\
TA,) which is of ↓ غِمَآءٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, the<br>\
first, [in the CK, erroneously, غَماء,] A covering<br>\
that is put upon a horse in order that he may<br>\
sweat. (ISd, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also غَمْىٌ.<br>\
-A2-  And see<br>\
4, near the end.<br>\
صُمْنَا لِلْغُمْيَةِ: see غَمْىٌ.<br>\
غِمَآءٌ: see غَمًى, in two places.<br>\
غَامِيَآءُ One of the entrances to the burrow of the<br>\
jerboa. (K.)<br>\
مُغْمًى عَلَيْهِ and مَغْمِىٌّ عَلَيْهِ: see 4, near the<br>\
end.<br>\
