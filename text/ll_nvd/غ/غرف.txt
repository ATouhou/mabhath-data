غَرُفَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\

took [or laded out] the water with his hand [as<br>\
with a ladle]: (K, TA:) and in like manner,<br>\
بِالمِغْرَفَةِ [with the ladle]. (JK.)<br>\
-A2-  غَرَفَ الشَّىْءَ,<br>\
(S, O, K, *) aor.<br>\
غَرُفَ, (TK,) inf. n. غَرْفٌ, (TA,) He cut,<br>\
or cut off, the thing. (S, O, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  And غَرَفَ<br>\

inf. n. غَرْفٌ, (TA,) He tanned the skin with غَرْف<br>\
[q. v.]. (S, O, TA.)<br>\

(S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And It bent, or became bent:<br>\
(Yaakoob, TA:) and some say, it broke, or became broken: (TA:) [and ↓ غَرَفَ, inf. n. غَرْفٌ,<br>\
app. has both of these meanings; for] الغَرْفُ,<br>\
accord. to IAar, signifies The bending, or becoming bent; and the breaking, or becoming<br>\
broken. (TA.) انغرف said of a bone means It<br>\
broke, or became broken: and said of a branch,<br>\

إِغْتَرَفَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
غَرْفٌ and ↓ غَرَفٌ, (S, K,) the latter mentioned<br>\
by Yaakoob, (S,) A species of trees, (شَجَرٌ,) with<br>\
which one tans; (S, K;) when dry, [said to be]<br>\
what are termed ثُمَام: (TA: [but perhaps this<br>\
statement applies particularly to غَرَفٌ, which see<br>\
below: and see also ثُمَامٌ:]) accord. to A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
called غَرْفٌ and غَلْفٌ [q. v.]: AHn says, the غرف<br>\
is a species of trees from which bows are made;<br>\
[see عِضَاهٌ;] and no one tans with it; but Kz says<br>\
that its leaves may be used for tanning therewith,<br>\
though bows be made of its branches: and Aboo-Mohammad mentions, on the authority of As,<br>\
that one tans with the leaves of the ↓ غَرَف, and<br>\
not with its branches: El-Báhilee says that غَرْفٌ<br>\
signifies certain skins, not such as are termed<br>\
قَرَظِيَّة, [i. e. not tanned with قَرَظ, but] tanned, in<br>\
Hejer, in the following manner: one takes for<br>\
them sprigs (هَدَب) of the أَرْطَى, and puts them in<br>\
a mortar, and pounds them, then throws upon<br>\
them dates, whereupon there comes forth from<br>\
them an altered odour, after which a certain<br>\
quantity is laded out for each skin, which is then<br>\
tanned therewith; and the term غَرْف is applied to<br>\
that which is laded out, and to every quantity of<br>\
skin from that mash, to one and to all alike: but<br>\
Az says, the غَرْف with which skins are tanned is<br>\
well known, of the trees of the desert (البَادِيَة), and,<br>\
he says, I have seen it; and what I hold is this,<br>\
that the skins termed غَرْفِيَّة are thus termed in<br>\
relation to the species of trees called the غَرْف, not<br>\
to what is laded out: As says that الغَرْفُ, with<br>\
the ر quiescent, signifies certain skins that are<br>\
brought from El-Bahreyn. (TA.)<br>\
غَرَفٌ, (O, K, TA,) accord. to AA, (O,) or<br>\
IAar, (T, TA,) i. q. ثُمَامٌ [Panic grass]; (O, K,<br>\
TA;) not used for tanning therewith; and accord.<br>\
to Az, this that IAar says is correct: AHn says<br>\
that when it becomes dry, and one chews it, its<br>\
odour is likened to that of camphor: (TA:) or<br>\
ثُمَام while green: (K:) or one of the species of<br>\
ثُمَام, which resembles rushes (أَسَل,) of which<br>\
brooms are made, and with which water-bags of<br>\
leather are covered to protect them from the sun<br>\
so that the water becomes cool: (A &#39;Obeyd, TA:)<br>\
the n. un. is with ة. (AHn, O.) And, (O, K,)<br>\
accord. to Skr, (O,) The شَثّ, and طُبَّاق, and<br>\
نَشَم [thus (correctly) in the O, but in the K<br>\
بَشَم], and عَفَار [in the CK غَفار], and عُتْم, and<br>\
صَوْم, and حَبَج, and شَدْن, and حَيَّهَل [or حَيَّهْل],<br>\
and هَيْشَر, and ضُرْم [thus in the O and in some<br>\
copies of the K] or ضِرْم [thus in other copies of<br>\
the K]: every one of these is called غَرَف. (O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also غَرْفٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The<br>\
leaves of trees (K, TA) with which tanning is performed. (TA.)<br>\
غَرْفَةٌ A single act of taking [or lading out]<br>\
water with the hand [as with a ladle: and in<br>\
like manner also with a ladle: see 1, first sentence]. (S, * Mgh, * Msb, * K.)<br>\

act of cutting, or cutting off, a thing: or of clipping the forelock of a horse. (K, * TA.)<br>\
غُرْفَةٌ The quantity of water that is taken [or<br>\
laded out] with the hand [as with a ladle]; (JK,<br>\
S, * Mgh, * O, Msb, * K;) as much thereof as fills<br>\
the hand; (JK;) and ↓ غُرَافَةٌ signifies the same:<br>\
(O, K:) before it is so taken it is not termed غُرْفَة:<br>\
(S, K:) the pl. is غِرَافٌ. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\

which latter is held by some to be a pl. pl. (Msb)<br>\
and غُرُفَاتٌ and غُرْفَاتٌ. (S, O, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
الغُرْفَةُ signifies The Seventh Heaven: (S, * O, * K:)<br>\
or the highest of the places of Paradise: or it is<br>\
one of the names of Paradise. (Bd in xxv. 75.)<br>\
Accord. to the S [and O], the phrase دُونَ غُرْفَةِ<br>\
عَرْشِهِ occurs in a verse of Lebeed, as applying to<br>\
the Seventh Heaven: but what is [found] in his<br>\
poetry is دُونَ عِزَّةِ عَرْشِهِ. (IB, TA.)<br>\

species of tree called غَرْف: (S, O, K:) Aboo-Kheyreh says that the [skins termed] غرفيّة are<br>\
of El-Yemen and El-Bahreyn: and accord. to<br>\
AHn, one says ↓ مَزَادَةٌ غَرَفِيَّةٌ and قِرْبَةٌ غَرَفِيَّةٌ; and<br>\
the pl. غَرَفِيَّاتٌ occurs in a verse [in which the ر<br>\

tangled, or confused, or dense, trees; &amp;c.]: (AHn,<br>\
