غَانَ عَلَيْهِ كَذَا, [aor. يَغِينُ, inf. n. غَيْنٌ,]<br>\
Such a thing covered, veiled, or concealed, him, or<br>\
it: (Ham p. 574:) [and so ↓ أَغَانَهُ; whence]<br>\
one says, الغَيْنُ السَّمَآءَ ↓ اغان The clouds covered,<br>\
or overspread, or wholly covered, the sky. (S, K.)<br>\
And غِينَ عَلَى كَذَا Such a thing was covered<br>\
over. (S.) [Hence,] غِينَ عَلَى قَلْبِهِ, inf. n. غَيْنٌ;<br>\
as also ↓ أُغِينَ [in the CK (erroneously) اَغْيَنَ];<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  His heart was invaded by desire, or appetite, as<br>\
by a thing that covered it: or was covered [so as<br>\
to be rendered unsusceptible]: or was enveloped by<br>\
the like of rust [or clouded or rendered dull]. (K,<br>\
TA. [For الرَّيْن, meaning “ the like of rust ”<br>\
covering the heart, the CK has الدَّيْن.]) The<br>\
saying, in a trad., إِنَّهُ لَيُغَانُ عَلَى قَلْبِى (S, Msb,<br>\
TA) حَتَّى أَسْتَغْفِرَ اللّٰهَ فِى اليَوْمِ سَبْعِينَ مَرَّةً (TA)<br>\
is from the phrase غِينَ عَلَى كَذَا signifying as<br>\
expl. above, (S,) and means (assumed tropical:)  Verily my heart is<br>\
invaded as though it were covered, by unmindfulness from which mankind will not be free so<br>\
that I beg forgiveness of God in the day seventy<br>\
times: (TA:) or it means, being used metonymically, verily I become diverted from المُرَاقَبَة<br>\
[meaning the fear of God, or, as a conventional<br>\
term, the constant knowledge of God&#39;s cognition of<br>\
me in all my states or circumstances,] by the<br>\
affairs that are for good relating to the present<br>\
world; for these, though matters of importance,<br>\
are, in comparison with the affairs relating to the<br>\
other world, as idle sport, in the estimation of the<br>\
people who follow the rule of المُرَاقَبَة. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, غِينَتِ السَّمَآءُ, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. غَيْنٌ; as also غَانَت, inf. n. غَيْنٌ; [like<br>\
غَامَت;] (TA;) The sky became covered (Msb,<br>\
TA) with غَيْن (Msb) or غَيْم (TA) [i. e. clouds,<br>\
or an expanse of clouds].<br>\
-A2-  غِنْتُ, aor. أَغِينُ,<br>\
[inf. n. غَيْنٌ,] I was, or became, thirsty. (S, K.)<br>\
And غَانَتِ الإِبِلُ i. q. غَامَت (S, K, TA) i. e. The<br>\
camels were, or became, thirsty. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
غَانَتْ نَفْسُهُ, (S,) or نَفْسِى, (K,) aor. تَغِينُ, (S, K,)<br>\
inf. n. غَيْنٌ, (TA,) His, or my, soul [or stomach]<br>\
heaved, or became agitated by a tendency to vomit;<br>\
syn. غَثَتْ. (S, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
حَسَنَةً ↓ غَيَّنَ غَيْنًا and حَسَنًا He wrote a<br>\
beautiful غ. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَغْيَنَ see the first paragraph, in three places.<br>\
غَانٌ: see غَيْنَةٌ.<br>\
غَيْنٌ [mentioned above as an inf. n. is also a<br>\
subst., as such] i. q. غَيْمٌ, (K, TA,) a dial. var.<br>\
of the latter word, (S, Msb, TA,) signifying<br>\
clouds; (TA;) [or an expanse of clouds;] as in<br>\
the phrase فِى يَوْمِ غَيْنٍ in a day of clouds: (S, *<br>\
TA:) or, meaning “ clouds,” it is from غَانَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ كَذَا signifying as expl. in the beginning of<br>\
this art. (Ham p. 574.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And شَجَرٌ غَيْنٌ Dense,<br>\
or tangled, trees: (TA:) like غَيْمٌ. (TA in art.<br>\
غيم.)<br>\
-A2-  Also [like غَيْمٌ signifying] Thirst. (S,<br>\
K. [See also 1.])<br>\
-A3-  And [The letter غ;] one<br>\
of the letters of the alphabet: (S, K:) pl. [of<br>\
mult.] غُيُونٌ and [of pauc.] أَغْيَانٌ and غَيْنَاتٌ.<br>\
(TA.) See 2, and art. غ.<br>\
غَانَةٌ The ring at the head of the bow-string.<br>\
(K.) [See عُنْتُوتٌ.]<br>\
غَيْنَةٌ i. q. أَجَمَةٌ; [like غَيْضَةٌ, q. v.;] so in the<br>\
M; (TA;) [and it is said that] الغَيْنَةُ الشَّجْرَآءُ is<br>\
like الغَيْضَةُ الخَضْرَآءُ: or, accord. to Abu-l-<br>\
&#39;Ameythel [or &#39;Omeythil], (S, TA,) غَيْنَةٌ signifies<br>\
[A collection of] tangled, or confused, or dense,<br>\
trees, (S, K, TA,) in the mountains, and in the<br>\
plain, or soft, land, (TA,) without water; (S,<br>\
K, TA;) if with water, called غَيْضَةٌ: (S, TA:)<br>\
[and Golius states, as on the authority of Yákoot,<br>\
that ↓ غَانٌ signifies the same as غَيْنَةٌ.]<br>\
غِينَةٌ The fluid that runs from a carcass, or<br>\
corpse, (S,) or from the dead: and [the humour,<br>\
or matter, termed] صَدِيد, q. v. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also the next paragraph.<br>\
أَغْيَنُ Green: (S, TA:) or green inclining to<br>\
blackness: (so in one of my copies of the S:)<br>\
and [its fem.] غَيْنَآءُ is applied to a tree (شَجَرَةٌ) as<br>\
meaning green, (AO, S, K, TA,) abounding with<br>\
leaves, having tangled, or dense, branches, (AO,<br>\
S, TA,) and soft, or tender: and sometimes it is<br>\
thus applied to herbs: (TA:) or [applied to a<br>\
tree] it signifies great, having wide shade: from<br>\
the phrase غَانَ عَلَيْهِ كَذَا, expl. in the beginning<br>\
of this art.: (Ham p. 574:) and أَغْيَنُ signifies<br>\
[also] such as is tall, (K, TA,) of trees, or, by<br>\
way of comparison [thereto], of men: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. is غِينٌ: (S, TA:) which is expl. by Kr<br>\
as meaning the abundance, and collected state,<br>\
and beauty, of [the trees called] أَرَاك and سِدْر;<br>\
but what is well known is that it is pl. of غَيْنَآء<br>\
applied to a tree; of which ↓ غِينَةٌ, with kesr,<br>\
has also been mentioned as a pl., though, as ISd<br>\
says, this is not known in the [genuine] language, nor is it agreeable with the analogy of<br>\
Arabic. (TA.)<br>\
مُغْيِن, in the original form, [for مُغِين, act.<br>\
part. n. of أَغَانَ,] is used by Ru-beh in the<br>\
following verse:<br>\
أَمْسَى بِلَالٌ كَالرَّبِيعِ المُدْجِنِ<br>\
أَمْطَرَ فِى أَكْنَافِ غَيْنٍ مُغْيِنِ<br>\
[There was, or came, in the evening, a moisture<br>\
like the continual rain of winter that has rained<br>\
in the tracts of overspreading clouds]. (S.)<br>\
