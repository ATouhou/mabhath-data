requiring punishment (TA:) a debt, (S, TA:)<br>\
a fine, or mulet: (MA:) the pl. of ↓ مَغْرَمٌ is<br>\
مَغَارِمُ, agreeably with analogy; or this is pl. of<br>\
غُرْمٌ, anomalously, like as مَحَاسِنُ is of حُسْنٌ.<br>\

غَرْمَى A woman heavy, or sluggish; syn. ثَقِيلَةٌ:<br>\
(K:) or, accord. to IAar, i. q. مُغَاضِيَةٌ [that makes,<br>\
and is made, angry: or that breaks off from, or<br>\

used in swearing]: one says غَرْمَى وَجَدِّكَ [Verily,<br>\
or now surely, by thy grandfather, or by thy<br>\

dial. vars. thereof. (TA.)<br>\

مِنْ غَرِيمِ السَّوْءِ مَا سَبَحَ [Take them from the (??)<br>\
debtor what has become easy of attachment, (S:)<br>\
and ↓ غَارِمٌ signifies the same as غَرِيمٌ ; CCC<br>\

or [it virtually signifies thus, but properly] it is a<br>\
possessive epithet signifying ذُو غَرَامٍ or غَرَامَةٍ or<br>\
تَغْرِيمٍ. (TA.) And (sometimes, S) it signifies<br>\
A creditor also: (S, Msb, K:) thus having two<br>\
contr. meanings; (K) Kutheiyir says,<br>\
* قَضَى كُلُّ ذِى دَيْنٍ فَوَفَّى غَرِيمَهُ<br>\
* وَعَزَّةُ مَمْطُولٌ مُعَنًّى غَرِيمُهَا<br>\
[Every debtor has paid, and fully rendered to<br>\
his creditor; but as to Azzeh CCC, her creditor is put<br>\
off, and wearied]. (S.) The pl. of غَرِيمٌ is غُرَمَآءُ<br>\
(I Ath, Msb, TA) and غُرَّامٌ, which is a strange<br>\
[i. e. an anomalous] pl., (I Ath, TA;) or this is<br>\
pl. of ↓ غَارِمٌ as syn. with غَرِيمٌ [and thus is agree<br>\
able with analogy]; or it is pl. of ↓ مُغْرِمٌ [signifying “ burdened with debt. ”], formed by the rejection of the augmentative letter [of the sing].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, An adversary in contention,<br>\
dispute, or litigation; an antagonist; a litigant;<br>\
because, by his pressing upon his adversary [like<br>\
the creditor upon his debtor], he becomes one who<br>\
cleaves, or clings. (Msb.)<br>\

غَارِمٌ: see غَرِيمٌ, in two places.<br>\
مَغْرَمٌ; pl. مَغَارِمُ: see غُرْمٌ, in two places.<br>\
مُغْرَمٌ Shackled, (K,) or burdened, (TA,) with<br>\
debt; (K;) an epithet applied to a man from الغُرْمُ<br>\
and الدَّيْنُ. (S.) See غَرِيمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  And A captive<br>\
of love; (K, TA;) i. e., of the love of women:<br>\
(TA:) or one to whom love cleaves: (Ham<br>\
p. 558:) or you say رَجُلٌ مُغْرَمٌ بِالحُبِّ [a man to<br>\
whom love cleaves, or clung to by love]; from the<br>\
love of women: (S:) and هُوَ مُغْرَمٌ بِالنِّسَآءِ He is<br>\
one who clings to women, like as does the غَرِيم [or<br>\
“ creditor ” to the debtor]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) And<br>\
مُغْرَمٌ بِشَىْءٍ Eagerly desirous of a thing; fond of<br>\
it; or attached to it; syn. مُولَعٌ بِهِ; (Msb, K,<br>\
