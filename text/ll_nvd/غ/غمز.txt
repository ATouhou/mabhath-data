غَمَزَهُ, (S, A, K,) or غَمَزَهُ بِيَدِهِ, (Msb,) aor.<br>\
غَمِزَ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) inf. n. غَمْزٌ, (TA,) He felt him, (namely,<br>\
a ram,) to know if he were fat: (S, A, Msb, K:)<br>\
and غَمَزَهَا he put his hand upon her (a camel&#39;s)<br>\
back, to see how fat she was. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
(Msb,) غَمَزَهُ بِيَدِهِ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
غَمِزَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. غَمْزٌ, (A, K,) He pressed, or squeezed, it,<br>\
[with his hand,] namely, a limb, (A, K, TA,)<br>\
and a man&#39;s back. (TA.) So in a trad. of<br>\
&#39;Omar: دَخَلَ عَلَيْهِ وَعِنْدَهُ غُلَيْمٌ يَغْمِزُ ظَهْرَهُ [He<br>\
went in to him, and with him was a little boy<br>\
pressing, or squeezing, or kneading, his back].<br>\
(TA.) And in a trad. respecting the ablution<br>\
termed الغُسْل, it is said, اِغْمِزِى قُرُونَكِ, meaning<br>\
Press thou, or squeeze thou, the locks of thy hair,<br>\
in washing. (TA.) You also say, غَمَزَ الثِّقَافُ القَنَاةَ<br>\
The straightening-instrument pinched and pressed<br>\
the spear. (A, * Mgh, TA. *) A poet (namely<br>\
Ziyád El-Aajam, TA) says,<br>\
وَكُنْتُ إِذَا غَمَزْتُ قَنَاةَ قَوْمٍ<br>\
كَسَرْتُ كُعُوبَهَا أَوْ تَسْتَقِيمَا<br>\
[And I used, when I pinched and pressed the<br>\
spear of a people, to break its knots, or internodal portions, unless it became straight]. (S, TA.<br>\
It is a prov., respecting which see remarks in<br>\
art. او.)<br>\
-A2-  غَمَزَ, (A, Msb,) and غَمَزَهُ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
K,) aor.<br>\
غَمِزَ, (Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. غَمْزٌ, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) (tropical:)  He made a sign, (A, Msb,) and he made<br>\
a sign to him, (Mgh, K, *) with the eye, (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) or eyebrow, (A, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
or eyelid [by winking]. (K.) So in the saying,<br>\
in a trad., غَمَزَنِى عَلِىٌّ أَنْ قُلْ نَعَمْ (tropical:)  &#39;4lee made a<br>\
sign to me with the eye, or eyebrow, meaning,<br>\
Say thou Yes. (Mgh.) The people of the West<br>\
say, غَمَزَهُ فُلَانٌ بِفُلَانٍ, meaning, (tropical:)  Such a one<br>\
blinked towards such a one, to instigate him<br>\
against him, or in order that he should have<br>\
recourse to him for protection or the like, or seek<br>\
aid of him. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, الغَمْزُ بِالنَّاسِ:<br>\
(S:) you say, غَمَزَ بِالرَّجُلِ, aor.<br>\
غَمِزَ, (K,) inf. n. غَمْزٌ,<br>\
(TA,) (tropical:)  He calumniated, or slandered, the man.<br>\
(K.) [See also 4.] ―<br>\
-b3-  You say also, غُمِزَتْ شَهَادَتَهُ<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  His testimony was suspected (see مَغْمُوزٌ), or<br>\
impugned]. (TA in art. زور.)<br>\
-A3-  غَمَزَتِ الدَّابَّةُ,<br>\
(K,) or غَمَزَ فِى مَشْيِهِ, (Msb,) or مِنْ رِجْلِهِ, (S,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
غَمِزَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. غَمْزٌ, (S, Msb,) (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
beast limped, or it halted, with its hind leg; had a<br>\
slight lameness thereof: (K, * TA:) or he had what<br>\
resembled عَرَج [or natural lameness] in his gait:<br>\
(Msb:) or, as IKtt says, غَمَزَتِ الدَّابَّةُ بِرِجْلِهَا the<br>\
beast gave an indication of a limping, or halting,<br>\
or slight lameness, in its hind leg: whence it<br>\
appears that this signification may be tropical.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A4-  غَمَزَ said of a disease, or of a vice, or<br>\
fault, of a man, It appeared. (AA, K.)<br>\
-A5-  See<br>\
also 4.<br>\
3<br>\
غَاْمَزَ [This verb is mentioned by Golius as syn.<br>\
with عايب, a verb for which I find no authority:<br>\
and Freytag renders it “ Vitii arguit,” and refers<br>\
to a passage in Har (p. 427 of the see. ed.)<br>\
where (like as is done by Golius) المُغامِز and<br>\
المُعايِب, as syn., are erroneously put for المَغامِز<br>\
and المَعايِب.]<br>\
4<br>\
أَغْمَزَتْ She (a camel) had fat, (O, K,) or<br>\
a little fat, (ISd, IKtt, TA,) in her hump. (ISd,<br>\
IKtt, O, K.) Hence the epithet ↓ غَمُوزٌ, applied<br>\
to her. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اغمز فِى فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  He blamed, or<br>\
found fault with, such a one; attributed or imputed to him, or charged him with, or accused<br>\
him of, a vice, or fault; (S, IKtt, K, TA;)<br>\
deemed him weak; (TA;) lessened his rank, or<br>\
dignity: (S, IKtt, K, * TA:) he found in him<br>\
that for which he should be deemed weak: (A,<br>\
TA:) and ↓ اغتمزهُ he impugned his character;<br>\
blamed him; censured him; or spoke against him.<br>\
(K.) You say, فُلَانٌ ↓ فَعَلْتُ شَيْئًا فاغْتَمَزَهُ (tropical:)  I did<br>\
a thing, and such a one impugned my character,<br>\
or found in it that by which my character was<br>\
impugned. (S, TA.) And سَمِعَ مِنِّى كَلِمَةً<br>\
فِى عَقْلِهِ ↓ فَاغْتَمَزَهَا (tropical:)  He heard from me a saying,<br>\
and deemed it weak: (A, TA:) and in like manner, أَغْمَزَ فِيهَا found in it that for which it was<br>\

-A3-  أَغْمَزَنِى الحَرُّ (tropical:)  The<br>\
heat remitted, or abated, to me, so that I became<br>\
emboldened to encounter it, and went upon the road:<br>\
(AA, ISk, S, IKtt, K, * TA:) Az says ↓ غَمَزَنِى<br>\
الحَرُّ, on the authority of AA: (TA:) and AA<br>\
mentioned اغمرنى الحرّ in this sense, but afterwards doubted, and said, I think that it is with<br>\
زاى. (TA in art. غمر.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And أَغْمَزَ (assumed tropical:)  He (a<br>\
man) became gentle, so that others were emboldened<br>\
against him. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  And أَغْمَزَ [for<br>\
which أَغْمَزَه is erroneously put in the CK] He<br>\
acquired cattle such as are termed غَمَز [q. v.]:<br>\
(O, K, TA:) like أَقْمَزَ. (O.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَغَمَّزَ [This verb is said by Freytag to have a signification belonging to تَغَمَّرَ.]<br>\
6<br>\
تغامزوا They made signs, one to another,<br>\
with their eyes, (S, A, K, B,) or with the eyebrow, (A,) or hand, indicating something blameable or faulty. (B.) In this sense it is expl. as<br>\
used in the Kur lxxxiii. 30. (S, B.)<br>\
8<br>\

-b2-  And<br>\
A weak man: (S, O, K:) like قَمَزٌ: pl. أَغْمَازٌ,<br>\

غَمِيزٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
غَمِيزَةٌ (tropical:)  A thing for which one&#39;s character is<br>\
to be impugned; for which one is to be blamed,<br>\
censured, or spoken against; a vice, or fault; (S,<br>\
A, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ غَمِيزٌ (TA) and<br>\
↓ مَغْمَزٌ (S, A, Mgh, K) or ↓ مَغْمَزَةٌ: (Msb:) and<br>\
weakness in work, and impotence of mind, (TA,)<br>\
and ignorance: (T, TA:) the pl. of ↓ مَغْمَزٌ is<br>\
مَغَامِزُ, (TA,) syn. with مَعَايِبُ. (S.) You say,<br>\
لَيْسَ فِيهِ غَمِيزَةٌ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ↓ غَمِيزٌ,<br>\

doing so; syn. رَمَّازَةٌ. (TA in art. رمز.) ―<br>\
-b2-  غَمَّازٌ<br>\
One who blames, or finds fault with, others, much,<br>\
or habitually. (TA in art. همز.)<br>\
غَامِزٌ [meaning Limping, or halting, &amp;c., and<br>\
having a limping, or halting, &amp;c.,] is like ظَالِعٌ:<br>\
sometimes used as a possessive noun; and [therefore] one does not say غَامِزَةٌ. (O and TA in art.<br>\
ظلع.)<br>\
مَغْمَزٌ [should by rule be مَغْمِزٌ: its primary<br>\
signification is A place of feeling, to know if an<br>\
animal be fat: hence, a place of pressing or<br>\
squeezing a limb &amp;c.: and a place of pinching<br>\
and pressing a spear, to straighten it]. ―<br>\
-b2-  نُكْتَةٌ<br>\
لَامَغْمَزَ لِقَنَاتِهَا وَلَا مَقْرَعَ لِصَفَاتِهَا (tropical:)  [lit. A nice or<br>\
subtile saying, the spear of which has no place<br>\
where it requires to be pinched and pressed to<br>\
straiten it, and the rock of which has no rough<br>\
place requiring to be beaten, or for the rock of<br>\
which there is no beating,] means, (assumed tropical:)  that has no<br>\
crookedness: مقرع is an inf. n., or means “ a<br>\
place of beating,” and صفاة is “ a rock; ” and<br>\
the above-mentioned use of these two words is<br>\
borrowed from the phrase قَرَعَ صَفَاتَهُ, meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  “ he impugned his character; blamed, or censured, him; or spoke against him. ” (Mgh.) ―<br>\
