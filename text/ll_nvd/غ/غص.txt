غَصَّ, (Msb, MF,) sec. pers. غَصِصْتَ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) and غَصَصْتَ, (Msb, K,) the latter extr.,<br>\
(TA, [see 1 in art. عض,]) aor. يَغَصُّ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
when the sec. pers. of the pret. is غَصِصْتَ, (Msb,)<br>\
and يَغُصُّ, (Msb, TA,) when the sec. pers. of the<br>\
pret. is of the other form mentioned above, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. غَصَصٌ, (S, K,) or غَصٌّ, (Msb,) or the<br>\
former when the aor. is يَغَصُّ, and the latter when<br>\
the aor. is يَغُصُّ, (TA,) His throat, or fauces, became choked, or obstructed, (S, K, MF,) by food:<br>\
(S, Msb, MF:) [as also, app., ↓ اِغْتَصَّ:] accord.<br>\
to some of those skilled in the science of lexicology,<br>\
you say غَصَّ when it is by food, and شَرِقَ when<br>\
it is by beverage, [or by the spittle, and water,<br>\
and the like, (see art. شرق,)] and شَجِىَ when it<br>\
is by a bone, and جَرِضَ when it is with spittle;<br>\
but every one of these is sometimes used in the<br>\
place of any other: (MF:) and [thus] you say<br>\
also, غَصَّ بِالمَآءِ, meaning, his throat, or fauces,<br>\
became choked, or obstructed, by the water; or<br>\
the water stopped therein, and he was hardly able<br>\
to swallow it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] غَصَّ بِرِيقِهِ [lit.,<br>\
His throat, or fauces, became choked by his spittle;]<br>\
meaning, (tropical:)  he died. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence, also, غَصَّ<br>\
بِالغَيْظِ (tropical:)  [He was, or became, choked with wrath,<br>\
or rage]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And غَصَّ, alone, seems to<br>\
signify (assumed tropical:)  He became grieved, or disquieted in mind;<br>\
like as does شَجِىَ (q. v.): and it seems to be<br>\
indicated in the CK that ↓ اغتصّ signifies the<br>\
same: see غُصَّةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence also,] غَصَّتْ بِنَا<br>\
الأَرْضُ (assumed tropical:)  The land became straitened [as though it<br>\
were choked] by us. (TA.) And غَصَّ المَجْلِسُ<br>\
بِأَهْلِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [The sitting-place became straitened, or<br>\
choked, or choked up, by its people]; as also<br>\
↓ اغتصّ. (TA.)<br>\

اغصّهُ, (S, Msb, TA,) inf. n. إِغْصَاصٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He (a man, S, Msb) caused his throat, or fauces,<br>\
to be choked, or obstructed, (S,) by food; (Msb;)<br>\
syn. أَشْجَاهُ [which has the above-mentioned meaning and also another to he found below]. (TA.)<br>\
[And It (food &amp;c.) choked him.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, اغصّهُ<br>\
بِالغَيْظِ (tropical:)  [He (a man) caused him to become choked<br>\
with wrath, or rage]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,]<br>\
اغصّهُ بِرِيقِهِ [lit., He caused his throat, or fauces,<br>\
to become choked by his spittle;] meaning, (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
caused him to become grieved, or disquieted in<br>\
mind; (A, TA;) [like أَشْجَاهُ: and it seems to<br>\
be indicated in the CK that اغصّهُ without any<br>\
addition signifies the same: see غُصَّةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence<br>\
also,] اغصّ عَلَيْنَا الأَرْضَ (assumed tropical:)  He made strait to us<br>\
the land. (K, TA.)<br>\

إِغْتَصَ3َ see 1, in three places.<br>\
غُصَّةٌ A thing lying across in the throat, or<br>\
fauces, so as to cause a choking, or an obstruction,<br>\
thereof; (IDrd, A, * K;) a thing by which one<br>\
has his throat, or fauces, choked, or obstructed;<br>\
(TA;) food by which one has his throat, or<br>\
fauces, choked, or obstructed; (Msb;) i. q. شَجًا;<br>\
(S, K;) [which has another meaning that will be<br>\
found below; and both these meanings may be<br>\
intended by it in the S; but in the K, the latter<br>\
only seems to be intended; for there, between it<br>\
and the explanation which is here first given, we<br>\
find intervening the pl., and also, in the CK, the<br>\
words وَقَدْ اَغْصَصْتُهُ فاغْتَصَّ;] a thing by which one<br>\
is choked (شَجًا يُغَصُّ بِهِ, Lth, JK, TA) in the<br>\
حَرْقَدَة [meaning the head of the windpipe], (Lth,<br>\
TA,) or in the throat, or fauces: (JK:) pl. غُصَصٌ.<br>\
(S, Msb, K.) It is said in the Kur [lxxiii. 13],<br>\
وَطَعَامًا ذَا غُصَّةٍ (TA) And food that sticks fast,<br>\
(Bd,) or by which one is choked, (Jel,) in the<br>\
throat, or fauces. (Bd, Jel.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,<br>\
(tropical:)  Choking wrath or rage. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Grief, or disquietude of mind; a signification<br>\
often occurring; and app. intended by the explanation شَجًا in the K. See what is said on this<br>\
point above.] ―<br>\
-b4-  Hence also, غُصَصُ المَوْتِ [The<br>\
chokings, or strangulations, of death: the deathrattles: or (assumed tropical:)  the agonies of death]. (TA.)<br>\
غَصَّان: see what next follows.<br>\
غَاصٌّ A man having his throat, or fauces,<br>\
choked, or obstructed, (S, Msb, * K,) by food;<br>\
(S, Msb;) as also ↓ غَصَّان. (S [in two copies of<br>\
which it is written غَصَّانُ], K [in two copies of<br>\
which it is written غَصَّانٌ], Msb [in my copy of<br>\
which, as well as in the TA, it is without any<br>\
final syll. sign].) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,] غَاصٌّ بِالقَوْمِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  An abode, or a place of alighting, filled [and as<br>\
it were choked up] with the company of men;<br>\
(S, A, K;) and in like manner a mosque; as<br>\
also ↓ مُغْتَصٌّ. (A.)<br>\
