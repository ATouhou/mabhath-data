if belonging to this art., or R. Q. 2 if<br>\
belonging to art. غو. تَغَاغَى عَلَيْهِ الغَوْغَآءُ [as<br>\
though originally تَغَوْغى] i. q. رَكِبُوهُ [i. e. The<br>\
mixed multitude, or the low, base, vile, &amp;c., of<br>\
men, bore, or pressed, or crowded, (as though<br>\
mounting,) upon him]. (TA in art. غو.)<br>\
غَاغٌ The حَبَق [q. v.], (IDrd, K, TA,) a species<br>\
of sweet-smelling plants, (TA,) i. e. the فُوذَنْج,<br>\
(IDrd, K, TA,) an arabicized word from [the<br>\
Pers. پُودِينَهْ: (TA:) [accord. to the TK, the<br>\
plant called in Turkish يارپوز, which is marjoram:]<br>\
↓ غَاغَةٌ [the n. un.] is said by Lth to mean a certain plant resembling the هَرْنَوَى [a word of which<br>\
both the orthography and the application are disputed]. (TA.)<br>\
غَاغَةٌ: see what here precedes:<br>\
-A2-  and see also<br>\
the paragraph here following.<br>\
غَوْغَآء [i. e. غَوْغَآءٌ and غَوْغَآءُ, as will be shown by<br>\
what follows; mentioned in this art. in the Msb<br>\
and K; and in the S, and again in the K and<br>\
TA, in art. غو;] masc. and fem., [being] perfectly<br>\
and imperfectly decl., (S and TA in art. غو,) in<br>\
the former case like قَمْقَامٌ, the ء being substituted<br>\
for ,, and in the latter case like عَوْرَآءُ, (S,) Locusts<br>\
after the growth of their wings, (AO, T, Msb, K,)<br>\
i. e. (AO, T, Msb) after the state in which they<br>\
are called دَبًا or دَبًى; (AO, T, S, Msb;) before<br>\
which earlier state they are called سِرْوَة [or rather<br>\
سَِرْء]: (A&#39;Obeyd, T, Msb: [see also جَرَادٌ:] or<br>\
locusts when they become light, or active, so as to<br>\
fly; thus accord. to AO, and IAth says the like<br>\
thereof: (TA:) or locusts when they have wings,<br>\
and almost fly, before they raise themselves and<br>\
fly; thus says As: (S:) or locusts, when they<br>\
have become divested of the [changing] colours,<br>\
and are becoming in a state of transition to redness. (As, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A sort of insects<br>\
resembling بَعُوض [or gnats], that do not bite,<br>\
(AO, S, Msb, K,) nor hurt, (AO, S, Msb,) by<br>\
reason of their weakness. (AO, S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) accord. to As, (S,) or AO, (Msb,)<br>\
as being likened to the locusts thus termed, (S,<br>\
Msb,) applied to men, (S, Msb, K,) meaning (tropical:)  A<br>\
mixed multitude of men; as also ↓ غَاغَةٌ: (S and<br>\
K in art. غو:) or the سَفِلَة [i. e. low, base, vile,<br>\
ignoble, mean, or sordid; or lowest or lower, basest<br>\
or baser, &amp;c.;] of men; and such as haste to do<br>\
evil: and it may be from the signification here<br>\
following, because of the muchness of their clamour, or confused noise, and vociferation. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  [Like غَوْغَا in Pers., and probably from this<br>\
latter, if the converse be not the case,] it signifies<br>\
also Clamour, and a confusion of cries or shouts<br>\
or noises. (TA.)<br>\
