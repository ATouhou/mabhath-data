(S, O.)<br>\
-A2-  [And Freytag adds, in art. غيل, the<br>\
two following significations: the former, or both,<br>\

غَوْلٍ A land far extending, though in the view of<br>\
the eye of little extent: (IKh, TA:) and غَيِّلٌ<br>\

-A2-  In the<br>\
saying in the Kur [xxxvii. 46], لَا فِيهَا غَوْلٌ,<br>\

another place, [lvi. 19,] لَا يُصَدَّعُونَ عَنْهَا: (S, O,<br>\
TA:) or it [there] means [simply] headache: or<br>\
intoxication: (K, TA:) thus some expl. it as<br>\

غُولٌ A kind of [goblin,] demon, devil, or jinnee,<br>\
which, the Arabs assert, appears to men in the<br>\
desert, assuming various forms, causing them to<br>\
wander from the way, and destroying them; (JM,<br>\
and TA * on the authority of IAth;) but this the<br>\
Prophet denied, saying, لَا غُولَ; by which, however, accord. to some, he did not mean to deny<br>\
the existence of the غول, but only the assertion of<br>\
the Arabs respecting its assuming various forms<br>\
and its being able to cause any one to go astray:<br>\
(IAth, JM, * TA:) i. q. سِعْلَاةٌ [q. v.]: or a sort<br>\

and it signifies also an enchantress of the jinn:<br>\

tusks, or fangs, (TA,) seen by the Arabs, and<br>\
known by them; and killed by Taäbbata Sharrà:<br>\
(K, TA:) and such as varies in form or appearance, of the enchanters and of the jinn; (K, TA;)<br>\
on his doing which, as is said in a trad., one<br>\
should hastily utter the call to prayer, to prevent<br>\
his mischief by the mention of God: (TA:) or<br>\
anything by reason of which the intellect departs;<br>\
as also ↓ غَوْلٌ: (K:) and anything that takes a<br>\
man unexpectedly and destroys him: (S, O, Msb:)<br>\

this sense is غَوَائِلُ; (K, * TA;) thus mentioned<br>\
by Ks. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A serpent: pl. أَغْوَالٌ:<br>\
(K:) accord. to Az, the Arabs call serpents أَغْوَال;<br>\
and thus this word is said to mean in the verse of<br>\
Imra-el-Keys,<br>\
لِيَقْتُلَنِى وَالمَشْرَفِىُّ مُضَاجِعِى<br>\
وَمَسْنُونَةٌ زُرْقٌ كَأَنْيَابِ أَغْوَالِ<br>\
[To slay me, while the Meshrefee sword was my<br>\
bedfellow, and so were sharpened, polished arrowheads, like the fangs of serpents]: (O, TA: *) but<br>\
AHát says that this is meant as an exaggeration:<br>\
(TA:) and it is said that the poet here means<br>\
devils. (O, TA.)<br>\
غِيلَةٌ The slaying covertly, (Mgh,) or on an<br>\
occasion of inadvertence; a subst. from اِغْتَالَهُ:<br>\

-b2-  [Hence,] أَرْضٌ<br>\
غَائِلَةُ النِّطَآءِ A land that destroys its inhabitant by<br>\
reason of its far extent. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And غَائِلَةٌ [as<br>\

and his running away; (Mgh in art. عدو, and<br>\
Msb;) and the like thereof: pl. غَوَائِلُ. (Msb.)<br>\

-b3-  And [hence, perhaps, (as denoting a cause for<br>\
reclaiming the price of a slave,) it is said that] it<br>\
signifies A right which another than the seller has<br>\
to the possession of a slave, whereby the sale is<br>\
annulled, and the seller is obliged to return the<br>\

destructive than anger?]. (S, O: immediately<br>\
following the explanation of the saying, الغَضَبُ<br>\
غُولُ الحِلْمِ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps,] عَيْشٌ أَغْوَلُ<br>\
A soft, or plentiful and easy, life; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád,<br>\
O, K;) as also ↓ غُوَّلٌ. (K.)<br>\

like the knife, (Msb,) the sheath of which is like<br>\
the whip: (S, O:) or an iron [weapon] that is<br>\
