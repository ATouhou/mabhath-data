تَغْرِيزٌ; (S;) The locust stuck her tail into the<br>\

our land, and remained fixed, or] did not quit it.<br>\

abstained from milking the she-camel: (A:) and<br>\
غرّز الغَنَمَ he ceased to milk the ewes or she-goats,<br>\
desiring that they should become fat: (TA:) and<br>\
غُرِّزَتِ النَّاقَةُ, inf. n. تَغْرِيزٌ, the she-camel was left<br>\
unmilked: or her udder was dashed with cold<br>\
water in order that her milk might cease: or she<br>\
was left unmilked once between two milkings:<br>\
(K:) this is when her milk has withdrawn:<br>\
(TA: [see also 2 in art. غزر:]) or تَغْرِيزٌ signifies<br>\
the sprinkling a she-camel&#39;s udder with water,<br>\
then daubing the hand with earth or dust and<br>\
slapping the udder, so that the milk is driven<br>\
upwards, then taking her tail and pulling it<br>\
vehemently, and slapping her with it, and leaving<br>\
her; whereupon she goes away for a while at<br>\
random. (AHn, TA.) It is said in a trad. of<br>\
&#39;Atà, that he was asked respecting the تغريز of<br>\
camels; and answered, “If it be for emulation, [to<br>\
make them more fat than those of other men,]<br>\
no; but if from a desire of putting them in a<br>\
good state for sale, yes: ” and IAth says that the<br>\
تغريز thereof may mean them increase, or offspring, (نِتَاج,) and fatness; from غَرْزُ الشَّجَرِ [the<br>\
planting of trees]; but that the more proper<br>\
explanation is that before given [which appears<br>\
to be one of the explanations here preceding].<br>\

time of journeying, (السَّيْرُ, K, or المَسِيرُ, S,) drew<br>\
near: (S, K:) or his journeying, or time of journeying, drew near: (TA:) from غَرْزٌ [meaning a<br>\
kind of stirrup]. (S, TA.) [But the reading<br>\
adopted by the author of the TA is app. السَّيْرَ;<br>\
agreeably with what I find in a copy of the A,<br>\
اِغْتَرَزْتَ السَّيْرَ, expl. by دَنَا مَسِيرُكَ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  It is said<br>\
in a trad., that a man asked him [meaning, app.,<br>\
Mohammad,] respecting the most excellent warring against unbelievers, and that he was silent<br>\
respecting at until اِغْتَرَزَ فِى الجَمْرَةِ الثَّالِثَةِ, i. e.,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He entered upon [the period of] the third جَمْرَة:<br>\
[meaning, that the most excellent is when the<br>\
weather has become hot; because warring is<br>\
then the most arduous: see جَمْرَةٌ:] like as the<br>\
foot of the rider enters into the غَرْز [or stirrup].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
غَرْزٌ The stirrup (S, Mgh, K) of the camel&#39;s<br>\
saddle, (S, Mgh,) made of skin, (S, K,) sewed;<br>\
(TA;) that of iron [or brass] or wood being<br>\
called رِكَابٌ; (S;) the camel&#39;s stirrup: (Msb:)<br>\
IAar says that it is to the she-camel like the<br>\
حِزَام to the horse: but others say, that it is to<br>\
the camel like the رِكَاب, to the mule. (TA.) You<br>\
say, اِلْزَمْ غَرْزَ فُلَانٍ [lit. Keep thou to the stirrup<br>\
of such a one; meaning,] (tropical:)  keep thou to the commands and prohibitions of such a one. (K, TA.)<br>\
And اُشْدُدْ يَدَيْكَ بِغَرْزِهِ (tropical:)  Cleave thou to him, (A,<br>\
K,) and leave him not. (A.) And it is said in a<br>\
trad., اِسْتَمْسِكْ بِغَرْزِهِ, meaning, (tropical:)  Cling thou to him,<br>\
and follow what he says and does, and disobey<br>\
him not; like as one lays hold upon the stirrup<br>\
of the rider and goes with him. (TA.)<br>\

small, growing upon the banks of rivers, having<br>\
no leaves, consisting only of sheaths (أَنَابِيب) set<br>\
one into another; and it is of the plants called<br>\
حَمْض: or, as some say, the [kind of rush called]<br>\
أَسَل: and spears are so called as being likened<br>\
thereto: As says, it is a plant which I have seen<br>\
in the desert, growing in plain, or soft, tracts of<br>\
land: (TA:) or its growth is like that of the<br>\
[sweet rush called] إِذْخِر; of the worst of pasture:<br>\
(K, TA:) AHn says, it is an unwholesome pasture; for when the she-camel that pastures upon<br>\
it is slaughtered, the غَرَز is found in her stomach<br>\
separate from the water, not diffused: and it<br>\
does not beget the cattle strength: the n. un. is<br>\
with ة: it has been erroneously mentioned as<br>\
being called عَرَز, with the unpointed ع (TA.)<br>\
غَرْزَةٌ A single puncture; syn. خَرْزَةٌ. (TA in<br>\

Meyd, as signifying “ sutura seu consutio vestis,<br>\
quæ densioribus fit punctorum interst(??) ” the<br>\
pl. is غُرَزٌ; not غُرْزٌ, as in the Lex. of Golius.)<br>\

original, disposition, temper, or other quality or<br>\
property; idiosynerasy; [of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ<br>\

signifying a disposition, &amp;c., implanted by the<br>\
Creator;] syn. طَبِيعَةٌ, (Lh, S, Msb, K,) and<br>\
قَرِيحَةٌ, (S,) and سَجِيَّةٌ, (TA.) and أَصْلٌ; (Lh,<br>\

the ground to lay her eggs; as also غَارِزَةٌ, and<br>\

-b2-  [Hence the saying, مَا طَلَعَ<br>\
السِّمَاكُ قَطُّ إِلَّا غَارِزًا ذَنَبَهُ فِى بَرْدٍ [(assumed tropical:)  Es-Simák has<br>\
never risen aurorally unless in conjunction with<br>\
cold]; meaning السِّمَاكُ الأَعْزَلُ, a well-known<br>\
star in the sign of Libra, [a mistake for Virgo,<br>\
for it is Spica Virginis, the Fourteenth Mansion<br>\
of the Moon,] which rises with the dawn on the<br>\
5th of Tishreen el-Owwal, [or October O. S.,<br>\
nearly agreeing with my calculation, accord. to<br>\
which it rose aurorally in Central Arabia, about<br>\
the commencement of the era of the Flight, on<br>\
the 4th of October O. S.,] (A, * TA.) when the<br>\
cold commences. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also the saying,] هُوَ غَارِزٌ رَأْسَهُ فِى سِنَتِهِ (tropical:)  He is ignorant,<br>\
(Sgh, K,) and departs from the care of himself<br>\
which is incumbent on him and pertaining to him.<br>\
(Sgh, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also غَارِزٌ A she-camel, (S, K,)<br>\
[and a ewe or a she-goat,] and an udder, (TA,)<br>\
having little milk: (S, K, TA:) or a she-camel<br>\
that has drawn up her milk from her udder:<br>\
(As, S:) pl. غُرَّزٌ (TA) [and غَوَارِزُ, for] you say<br>\

-b2-  [Hence,] عُيُونٌ<br>\
غَوَارِزُ (tropical:)  Eyes that shed no tears. (AZ, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence also,] غَارِزٌ applied to a man, (tropical:)  [Parum<br>\

تَغْرِيزٌ, sing. of تَغَارِيزُ, (K,) which signifies Offsets of palm-trees, &amp;c., that have been transplanted.<br>\
(Kt, S, K.)<br>\
مَغْرِزٌ The place of growth, [or of insertion,]<br>\
(أَصْل,) of a feather, and the like, [such as a<br>\
tooth, and also of the neck,] and of a rib, and of<br>\
the udder; [of which last, and of the neck, and<br>\
the like, it means the base, which is also termed<br>\
اصل:] pl. مَغَارِزُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] The place<br>\
in which the locust lays its eggs. (TA.) ―<br>\

thou good in the persons in whom it is naturally<br>\
implanted]; as also فى مَغَارِسِهِ. (A, TA.)<br>\
