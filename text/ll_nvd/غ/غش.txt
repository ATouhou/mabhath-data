dishonestly, or insincerely: (A. Msb, K:) and<br>\
he dressed up to him an affair [in false colours]:<br>\
(Msb:) or he acted towards him with dissimulation: pretended to him the contrary of what he<br>\
conceived in his mind: (A, K:) but this is a<br>\
needless addition, for it is the same as the first<br>\
explanation (TA:) as also ↓ غشّشهُ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَغْشِيشٌ: (TA) or this latter has an intensive<br>\
signification: it is said to be derived from غَشَشٌ,<br>\

is said in the story of Umm-Zara, accord. to one<br>\
relation, ↓ لَا تَمْلَأُ بَيْتَنَا تَغْشِيشًا, said by some to be<br>\
from الغِشُّ, and by others to be from [a usage of]<br>\
التغشيش as signifying النَّمِيمَةُ [app. here meaning<br>\
the embellishing speech with falsehood]: but accord.<br>\
to the approved relation, it is [تَغْشِيشًا] with the<br>\
unpointed letter. (IAth.) [See art. عش.] ―<br>\

[Also He made it to seem what it was not; falsified it; counterfeited it; adulterated it: so as<br>\

وَمُسْتَنْصَحٍ بِالْغَيْبِ غَيْرُ أَمِينِ<br>\
[O man, many a one whom thou reckonest dishonest in action, or advice, is honest therein to<br>\
thee; and (many a) one who is reckoned honest<br>\
in action, or advice, in that which is beyond the<br>\
reach of perception, is not faithful]. (TA)<br>\

solicitude, is in respect of what he has eaten].<br>\

غَشَشٌ A turbid drinking-place: (Az, IAmb,<br>\
Sgh, TA:) الكَدِرُ المَشُوبُ in the K is a mistake:<br>\
the right explanation of الغَشَشُ being المَشْرَبُ<br>\
الكَدِرُ, which is that given by Az and IAmb and<br>\
Sgh. (TA.)<br>\
غَشَاشٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
غِشَاشٌ, applied to a drinking (شُرْبٌ), Little in<br>\
quantity, (K, TA,) because of turbidness: (TA:<br>\

(K;) which is nearly the same as what Lth says.<br>\
