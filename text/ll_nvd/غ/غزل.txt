between the lover and the object of love; &amp;c.].<br>\
(S, * O, * K, * TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And غَزِلَ is also said of a<br>\
dog, meaning He flagged, or became remiss, in<br>\
the pursuit of a young gazelle; i. e., when he had<br>\
come up to it, the latter uttered a cry by reason of<br>\
its fright, whereupon he turned away from it, (S,<br>\
O, K, TA,) and became diverted; (S, O, TA;)<br>\
or, as IAar says, when it became sensible of the<br>\
presence of the dog, it became confounded, or perplexed, and clave to the ground, and he (the dog)<br>\
became diverted from it, and turned away: (TA:)<br>\
or he was confounded, or perplexed, in pursuing a<br>\
young gazelle, by its uttering a cry in his face<br>\
when he came up to it. (Meyd in explanation of<br>\

with her; (S, TA;) and in like manner one says<br>\
of a woman with a man: (S:) or he played,<br>\
or sported, [or dallied, or wantoned,] and held<br>\
amorous talk, with her. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one<br>\
says, أَطْيَبُ مِنْ أَنْفَاسِ الصَّبَا إِذَا غَازَلَتْ رِيَاضَ الربا<br>\
(tropical:)  [More pleasant, or delightful, than the breaths of<br>\
the east wind (which is to the Arabs like the<br>\
zephyr to us) when it has wantoned with the<br>\
meadows of الربا, (app. الرُّبَا, the name of a place,<br>\
mentioned in the K in art. ربو, there written<br>\
الرُّبَى, and in the TA in that art. said to occur in<br>\
poetry,) so as to have brought with it the odours<br>\
of flowers]. (K.) And هُوَ يُغَازِلُ رَغَدًا مِنَ العَيْشِ<br>\

subsistence]. (TA.) ―<br>\

4<br>\
اغزل, (K,) or اغزلت, (S, O,) He, or she,<br>\
turned round, or made to revolve, [or rather<br>\
twirled,] the مِغْزَل [or spindle]: (S, O, K:) [or<br>\
so اغزل المغزلَ, or اغزلتهُ, for] one says of the<br>\
مغزل [or spindle], أُغْزِلَ, i. e. it was turned round<br>\
[or twirled]. (Fr, S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اغزلت She (a gazelle)<br>\
had a young one. (S, O. [See غَزَالٌ.])<br>\
5<br>\
تغزّل He affected, or attempted, as a selfimposed task, (تَكَلَّفَ,) what is termed غَزَل [meaning as expl. below, i. e. the talk, and actions, and<br>\
circumstances, occurring between the lover and the<br>\
object of love; &amp;c.]. (S, O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
sometimes it means He made mention, or spoke,<br>\
[generally in verse,] of what is termed غَزَل. (TA.)<br>\
[See also شَبَّبَ, inf. n. تَشْبِيبٌ; and نَسَبَ, inf. n.<br>\
نَسِيبٌ.] One says, تغزّل بِالمَرْأَةِ meaning He mentioned the woman [in amatory language, as an<br>\
object of love,] in his poetry. (TA in art. غنى.)<br>\
6<br>\
تغازلوا [They talked, and acted in an<br>\

8<br>\
إِغْتَزَلَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
غَزْلٌ, applied to cotton, (S, O, K, TA,) and<br>\
flax, &amp;c., (TA,) or wool, and the like, (Msb,)<br>\
i. q. مَغْزُولٌ [i. e. Spun]: (S, O, Msb, K, TA:)<br>\
[or rather spun thread, or yarn of any kind; for]<br>\
it is an inf. n. used as a subst.: (Msb:) of the<br>\
masc. gender: pl. غُزُولٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And accord.<br>\
to ISd, The web of the spider. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
غَزْلُ النَبَاتِ is applied in Egypt to The sort of food<br>\
called إِطْرِيَة. (TA in art. طرو, q. v.)<br>\
غِزْلُ نِسَآءٍ A follower and lover of women; as<br>\
also نِسَآءٍ ↓ غِزِّيلُ: (JK:) [or both may be rendered one who talks, and acts in an amatory and<br>\
enticing manner; or who plays, sports, dallies, or<br>\
wantons, and holds amorous talk; with women:]<br>\
↓ غِزِّيلٌ is of the measure فِعِّيلٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure مُفَاعِلٌ; like حِدِّيثٌ and كِلِّيمٌ. (TA.)<br>\
غَزَلٌ, as expl. by &#39;Abd-El-Muttalib El-Baghdádee, in his Exposition of the نَقْدُ الشِعْرِ of<br>\
Kudámeh, signifies The talk, and actions, and<br>\
circumstances, occurring between the lover and the<br>\
object of love; differing somewhat from تَشْبِيبٌ,<br>\
which is a celebrating of the person and qualities<br>\
of the beloved; and from نَسِيبٌ, which is a mentioning of the state, or condition, of the نَاسِب<br>\
[himself], and of the object of the نَسِيب, and of<br>\
all the affairs, or events, occurring between them<br>\
two, [in the prelude of an ode,] thus including<br>\
the meaning of تَشْبِيبٌ, and being a mentioning of<br>\
غَزَل: accord. to Kudámeh, it signifies an inclining to foolish and youthful conduct, or a manifesting of passionate love, and becoming notorious<br>\
for affections to women: (TA:) or it is the subst.<br>\
from 3 [as such signifying talk, and amatory and<br>\
enticing conduct, with women; or play, sport, dalliance, or wanton conduct, and amorous talk, with<br>\
women]; (S, K;) as also ↓ مَغْزَلٌ: (K:) or play,<br>\
sport, or diversion, with women: (ISd, TA:) or<br>\
the talk of young men and [or with] young women:<br>\
(Msb:) or, accord. to the leading authorities in<br>\
polite literature, and those who have made the<br>\
language to be their study, [or rather accord. to<br>\
a loose and post-classical usage,] it signifies, like<br>\
نَسِيبٌ, praise of what are apparent of the menbers of the object of love: or the mention of the<br>\
days of union and of disunion: or the like thereof.<br>\
(MF.)<br>\
غَزِلٌ [is, by, rule, the part. n. of غَزِلَ, as such<br>\
signifying Talking, and acting in an amatory and<br>\
enticing manner, with a woman, or with women;<br>\
&amp;c.: but it is said that it] signifies صَاحِبُ غَزَلٍ;<br>\
(S, O;) or مُتَغَزِّلٌ بِالنِّسَآءِ; (K, TA;) by which is<br>\
here meant making mention, or speaking, or one<br>\
who makes mention, or who speaks, [generally in<br>\
verse,] of what is termed غَزَل [signifying as expl.<br>\
above, i. e. the talk, and actions, and circumstances, occurring between the lover and the object<br>\
of love; &amp;c.]; thus used as being a possessive<br>\
epithet, [not as a part. n. of غَزِلَ, because this<br>\
differs in meaning from تَغَزَّلَ,] i. e. it signifies<br>\
[properly] ذُوغَزَلٍ: (TA:) or it means displaying<br>\
amorous gestures or behaviour, and foolish and<br>\
youthful conduct such as is suitable to women, with<br>\
the love, or passionate love, that he experiences<br>\
for them, in order that they may incline to him:<br>\
(Kudámeh, TA:) or it is applied to a man as<br>\
meaning a companion of women because of his<br>\
lacking strength to be otherwise: from what here<br>\
follows. (IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Lacking strength, or<br>\
ability, to perform, or accomplish, things; (IAar,<br>\
K, TA;) remiss, or languid, in respect to them.<br>\
(IAar, TA.)<br>\
غَزُلِىٌّ [Of, or relating to, spun thread, or yarn;]<br>\
the rel. n. from غَزْلٌ used as a subst. (Msb.)<br>\
غَزَالٌ A young gazelle, وَلَدُ ظَبْيَةٍ: (Msb:) or a<br>\
شَادِن [or young gazelle], (T, S, O, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
or, as some say, the female, (TA, [but see what<br>\
follows,]) when it becomes active, or in motion,<br>\
(T, S, O, Msb, K, TA.) and walks; (T, Msb,<br>\
K, TA;) to which the girl, or young woman, is<br>\
likened in [the commencing of an ode by what is<br>\
termed] التَّشْبِيب, wherefore the epithet and the<br>\
verb [therein] are made mase.; (TA;) after the<br>\
becoming a ثَنِىّ [q. v.]: (T, Msb:) or in the stage<br>\
after that in which he is termed طَلًا [q. v.]:<br>\
(AHát, Msb, TA:) or from the time of his birth<br>\
until he attains to the most vehement running;<br>\
(K, TA;) which is when he puts his legs together,<br>\
[app. meaning his fore legs together and so his<br>\
hind legs,] and puts them down together and raises<br>\
them together: (TA:) or i. q. ظَبْىٌ [i. e. a gazelle,<br>\
of any age]: (M in art. ظبى: for الظَّبْىُ is there<br>\
expl. as meaning الغَزَالُ: [but this seems to be a<br>\
loose rendering:]) the female is called ↓ غَزَالَةٌ;<br>\
(Msb, MF, TA;) though it seems from what is<br>\
said in the K [&amp;c.] that الغَزَالُ is applied peculiarly to the male, and that the female is called<br>\
only ظَبْيَةٌ, as several of the lexicologists have<br>\
decisively asserted: (MF, TA:) the pl. [of pane.]<br>\
is غِزْلَةٌ and [of mult.] غِزْلانٌ. (S, O, Msb, K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
غَزَالُ شَعْبَانَ A certain insect (دُوَيْبَّةٌ), (K, TA,) a<br>\
species of the [locusts, or locust-like insects, called]<br>\
جَنَادِب [pl. of جُنْدَبٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  دَمُ الغَزَالِ A<br>\
certain plant, resembling the طَرْخُون [or tarragon],<br>\
(O, K,) which is eaten, (O,) burning, or biting,<br>\
to the tongue, (O, K,) green, and having a red<br>\
root, like the roots of the أَرْطَاة [n. un. of أَرْطًى,<br>\
q. v.], (O,) with the juice of which girls, or young<br>\
women, make red streaks like bracelets upon their<br>\
arms: (O, K:) thus AHn was informed by some<br>\
one or more of the Benoo-Asad: (O:) and Aboo-Nasr says, it is of the [kind called] ذُكُور. [See<br>\
also دَمُ الغَزَالِ and دَمُ الغِزْلَانِ and دُمْيَةُ الغِزْلَانِ<br>\
voce دمٌ in art. دمو or دمى; and see likewise<br>\
عَنْدَمٌ.]<br>\
غَزَالَةٌ fem. of غَزَالٌ, q. v.<br>\
-A2-  الغَزَالَةُ, also, signifies The sun; (S, O, K;) because it extends<br>\
[what resemble] cords, [meaning its rays,] as<br>\
though it were spinning: (K:) or the sun when<br>\
rising; (Msb, K;) [therefore] one says طَلَعَتِ<br>\
الغَزَالَةُ, but not غَرَبَتِ الغَزَالَةُ: (TA:) or the sun<br>\
when high: (M, * K, TA:) or the عَيْن [meaning<br>\
the disk, or, as it sometimes means, the rays, or<br>\
beams,] of the sun. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And غَزَالَةُ الضُّحَى<br>\
means, (S, O, K,) as also غَزَالَاتُهُ, (K,) [or غَزَالَاتُهَا,]<br>\
The beginning of the ضُحَى [or early part of the<br>\
forenoon, after sunrise]; (S, O, K;) [whence]<br>\
one says, جَآءَ فِى غَزَالَةِ الضُّحَى [He came in the<br>\
beginning of the ضُحَى]; and Dhu-r-Rummeh uses<br>\
الغَزَالَةَ, in the accus. case, as an adv. n., (S, O,)<br>\
meaning in the time [or in the beginning] of the<br>\
ضُحَى; (O;) or, accord. to IKh, this is for طُلُوعَ<br>\
الغَزَالَةِ, meaning at the rising of the sun: (TA:)<br>\
or the meaning of the phrases first mentioned in<br>\
this sentence is after, or a little after, (accord. to<br>\
different copies of the K,) the spreading of the<br>\
son, [i. e. of the sunshine,] and its entrance upon<br>\
the ضُحَى: or the first part of the ضُحَى, until<br>\
the passing away of a fifth (or about a fifth, TA)<br>\
of the day. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  Also (i. e. الغَزَالَةُ) A certain<br>\
herb, (Aboo-Nasr. O, K,) of the [kind called]<br>\
سُطَّاح, spreading upon the ground, with green<br>\
leaves, having no thorns nor broaches; from the<br>\
middle whereof comes forth a tall قَضِيب [or<br>\
shoot], which is peeled and eaten, (Aboo-Nasr,<br>\
O,) and it is sweet, (Aboo-Nasr, O, K,) and has<br>\
yellow blossoms from its bottom to its top: and it<br>\
is a pasture: (Aboo-Nasr, O:) every thing [i. e.<br>\
animal] eats it: (Aboo-Nasr, O, K;) and the<br>\
places of its growth are the plain, or soft, tracts.<br>\
(Aboo-Nasr, O)<br>\
غَزَّالٌ A vender [and a spinner] of غَزْل [i. e.<br>\
thread,. or gave]. (TA.)<br>\
غِزِّيلٌ; see غِزْلُ نِسَآءٍ, in two places.<br>\
غَازِلٌ [act. part. n. of غَزَلَ; Spinning]. The<br>\
pls. غُزَّلٌ and غَوَازِلُ are applied as epithets to<br>\
women: (K, TA:) but the former is also applied<br>\
to men, and is of a measure more usual as that<br>\
of the pl. of the mase. act. part. n. than of the<br>\
fem. (TA.)<br>\
أَغْزَلُ مِنْ عَنْكَبُوتٍ, from the act of spinning,<br>\
(Meyd,) or from the act of weaving [the web],<br>\
(O.) is a prov. [meaning More practised, or<br>\
skilled, in weaving than a spider]: and so مِنْ<br>\
سُرْفَةٍ [than a سُرْفَة, q. v.]. (Meyd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And one<br>\
says also, أَغْزَلُ مِنِ امْرِئِ القَيْسِ, (S, Meyd, O,)<br>\
likewise a prov., meaning [More practised, or<br>\
skilled,] in the celebrating of the person and qualities of the beloved in verse [than Imra-el-Keys].<br>\
(Meyd.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,] أَغْزَلُ مِنَ الحُمَّى<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [More frequent in visiting, or more habitual,<br>\
and more recurrent, than the fever]; a saying of<br>\
the Arabs, by which they mean that it [the fever]<br>\
is a frequent visiter of the sick person, recurrent<br>\
to him; as though passionately loving him: thus,<br>\
correctly, as in the L: in the K it is said that<br>\
الأَغْزَلُ applied to the fever (الحُمَّى [though this<br>\
is fem.]) means such as is a frequent visiter of<br>\
the sick person; recurrent. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And أَغْزَلُ<br>\
مِنْ فُرْعُلٍ [More confounded and perplexed than<br>\
a young one of the hyena]; from الغَزَلُ as signifying “ the being confounded and perplexed ” like<br>\
as is the dog (Meyd, O, K) when pursuing the<br>\
young gazelle; for it may be that the فرعل<br>\
becomes in the like state in pursuing the object<br>\
of its chase: (Meyd:) or فرعل was a man of<br>\
ancient times, and this saying (which is a prov.,<br>\
Meyd) is like أَغْزَلُ مِنِ امْرِئِ القَيْسِ. (Meyd, O,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
مَغْزَلٌ: see مِغْزَلٌ, in two places:<br>\
-A2-  and see<br>\
also غَزَلٌ, latter half.<br>\
مُغْزَلٌ: see مِغْزَلٌ, in three places.<br>\
مُغْزِلٌ A doe gazelle having a young one. (K.)<br>\
مِغْزَلٌ and ↓ مُغْزَلٌ (Fr, Th, S, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
↓ مَغْزَلٌ, (Th, O, K,) the first as pronounced by<br>\
[the tribe of] Temeem, the second as pronounced<br>\
by [that of] Keys, and the last the most rare,<br>\
(TA,) or the second as pronounced by Temeem,<br>\
(Msb,) A spindle; i. e. the thing with which one<br>\
spins: (S, MA, O, Msb, K. KL:) Fr says that<br>\
↓ مُغْزَلٌ is the original form, from أُغْزِلَ “ it was<br>\
made to turn round ” or “ revolve ” [or “ was<br>\
twirled ”]; (S, TA;) but the dammeh was deemed<br>\
by the Arabs difficult of pronunciation, and therefore they said مِغْزَلٌ, and in like manner مِصْحَفٌ<br>\
and مِخْدَعٌ and مِجْسَدٌ and مِطْرَفٌ: accord. to<br>\
IAth, مِغْزَلٌ signifies the instrument [with which<br>\
one spins]; and ↓ مَغْزَلٌ, the place of the غَزْل<br>\
[which means the act of spinning and the span<br>\
thread or yard]; and ↓ مُغْزَلٌ, the place in which<br>\
(فِيهِ [or this may here mean upon which]) the<br>\
غَزْل [i. e. spun thread or yarn] is put: (TA:)<br>\
pl. مَغَازِلُ. (MA.) أَعْرى مِنْ مِغْزَلٍ is a prov.<br>\
[meaning More naked than a spindle]. (Meyd.)<br>\
And one says, صَاحِبُ الغَزَلِ أَضَلُّ مِنْ سَاقِ مِغْزَلٍ<br>\
[The practiser of the talk and actions &amp;c. usual<br>\
between the lover and the object of love is more<br>\
erring than the shank (i. e. pin) of a spindle), of<br>\
which the error is its [aiding in] clothing mankind<br>\
while it is [itself] naked. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is<br>\
said in a book of certain of the Jews, عَلَيْكُمْ كَذَا<br>\
وَكَذَا وَرُبْعُ المِغْزَلِ, meaning [I pon you lie as due<br>\
from you such and such things and) the fourth<br>\
part of what your women have spun. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And [the pl.] مَغَازِلُ signifies The عَمَد (O) or عُمُد<br>\
(K) [app. meaning the upright wooden supports<br>\
of the seat] of the [machine called] نَوْرَج [q. v.]<br>\
with which the reaped grain heaped together is<br>\
thrashed. (O, K.)<br>\
مِغْزَلِىٌّ (MA) and ↓ مَغَازِلِىٌّ (S and K voce<br>\
مِصْرَمٌ) A parer of spindles. (MA.)<br>\
مُغَيْزِلٌ A slender cord (حَبْلٌ دَقِيقٌ) [so in copies<br>\
of the K, and in the CK, but in the latter المُغْتَزَلُ<br>\
is put for المُغَيْزِلُ: in my MS. copy of the K,<br>\
المُغَيْزِلُ جَبَلٌ دَقِيقٌ, and this I think to be the<br>\
correct reading. meaning El-Mugheyzil is a certain slender mountain]: ISd says, I think it to<br>\
be likened to the مِغْزَل, because of its slenderness; adding that El-Hirmázee has mentioned<br>\
it. (TA. [A verse cited by El-Hirmázee is there<br>\
given as an ex.; mentioning the day of المُغَيْزِل,<br>\
app. as the day of the separation of a lover from<br>\
his beloved; and it is a common custom of the<br>\
Arabs to call the day of an event the day of the<br>\
place where it occurred.])<br>\
