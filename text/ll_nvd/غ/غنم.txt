غَنِمَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
غَنَمَ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
غُنْمٌ (S, MA, Msb, * K, KL) and غَنْمٌ, (K,) or,<br>\
as some say, the former is a simple subst. and<br>\
the latter is an inf. n., (TA,) and غَنَمٌ and غَنِيمَةٌ<br>\
and غُنْمَانٌ, (K,) He, or they, (i. e. a man, Msb,<br>\
or a party of men, S,) obtained, got, or took,<br>\
(Msb, K, * TK,) spoil, (K, * TK,) or a thing [as<br>\
spoil]. (Msb, TA.) [And He acquired, or gained,<br>\
a thing without difficulty, or trouble, or inconvenience: or in this sense the inf. n. is غُنْمٌ,<br>\
which see below, voce غَنِيمَةٌ.] مَا غَنِمْتُمْ in the<br>\
Kur viii. 42 means What ye take by force [in<br>\
war] from the unbelievers. (Bd, Jel.) [See<br>\
also 8.]<br>\
2<br>\
غَنَّمْتُهُ, inf. n. تَغْنِيمٌ, I gave him spoil, or a<br>\
free and disinterested gift; syn. نَفَّلْتُهُ: (S:) or<br>\
غَنَّمَهُ كَذَا, inf. n. as above, he gave him such a<br>\
thing as spoil, or as a free and disinterested gift;<br>\
syn. نَفَّلَهُ إِيَّاهُ. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَغْنَمَهُ الشَّىْءَ He made the thing to be to him<br>\
spoil. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَغَنَّمَ see 8. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, هُوَ يَتَغَنَّمُ الأَمْرَ,<br>\
meaning He eagerly desires the affair like as one<br>\
eagerly desires spoil. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And تغنّم, (TA<br>\
in the present art.,) or تغنّم غَنَمًا, (AZ, T and TA<br>\
in art. ابل,) He took for himself, got, gained, or<br>\
acquired, sheep or goats or both: like as one says<br>\
تأبّل إِبِلًا. (AZ, T and TA in art. ابل; and TA *<br>\
in the present art.)<br>\
8<br>\
اغتنمهُ, as also ↓ تغنّمهُ, He reckoned it spoil:<br>\
(S, K:) or both signify he took, seized, caught, or<br>\
snatched, it as spoil. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] one<br>\
says, اغتنم الفُرْصَةَ He took, or seized, or [availed<br>\
himself of,] the opportunity; or he hastened to<br>\
take it; syn. اِنْتَهَزَهَا. (S and A and K in<br>\
art. نهز.)<br>\
غُنْمٌ: see غَنِيمَةٌ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  It signifies<br>\
also [The regaining (as is shown by an explanation of A &#39;Obeyd cited in the first paragraph of<br>\
art. غلق), and] the increase, and growth, and<br>\
excess in value, of a pledge. (O in art. غلق, and<br>\
TA in the present art.) Thus in a trad., in which<br>\
it is said, الرَّهْنُ لِمَنْ رَهَنَهُ لَهُ غُنْمُهُ وَعَلَيْهِ غُرْمُهُ [The<br>\
pledge pertains to him who pledged it; to him pertains the regaining of it, and its increase, and<br>\
growth, and excess in value, if such there be, and<br>\
upon him lies the obligation to pay the debt for it,<br>\
without requiring any abatement thereof if the<br>\
pledge have unavoidably suffered damage or total<br>\
loss: see the explanation of A &#39;Obeyd mentioned<br>\
above]. (TA.) الغُنْمُ بِالغُرْمِ means The غُنْم is<br>\
compensated (مُقَابَلٌ) by the غُرْم [i. e. the regaining of the pledge, with the increase and the growth<br>\
and the excess in value thereof if such there be, is<br>\
compensated by the payment of the debt for it];<br>\
for like as the owner [of the pledge] is exclusively<br>\
entitled to the غُنْم, no one sharing it with him,<br>\
so he bears the غُرْم, no one bearing it with him:<br>\
and this is the meaning of their saying, الغُرْمُ<br>\
مَجْبُورٌ بِالغُنْمِ [which may therefore be rendered<br>\
The loss suffered by the payment of the debt is<br>\
repaired by the regaining of the pledge; app. a<br>\
phrase of the lawyers, implying that such is to<br>\
be considered as the case whatever be the state of<br>\
the pledge at the time of its being restored unless<br>\
it have suffered damage through the fault of the<br>\
pledgee]. (Msb.) [See more in the first paragraph of art. غلق.] ―<br>\
-b3-  See also غُنَامَاكَ.<br>\
-A2-  غنم<br>\
[app. غُنْمٌ] is mentioned by Suh as the name of<br>\
A certain idol. (TA.)<br>\
غَنَمٌ i. q. شَآءٌ, (T, Msb, K,) meaning Sheep and<br>\
goats; (Msb;) [and both together;] a gen. n.,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) of the fem. gender, (S, K,) applied<br>\
to the males and the females, and to both<br>\
together: (S, Msb, K:) it has no sing. from<br>\
which it is derived, the sing. being شاة: the dual<br>\
غَنَمَانِ is used as meaning two flocks or herds [of<br>\
sheep or of goats or of both together]; (Msb, K;)<br>\
each flock or herd having its distinct place of<br>\
pasture and its pastor: (Msb, TA: *) and hence<br>\
it is said in a trad. that the poor-rate [meaning a<br>\
portion thereof] is to be given to him to whom<br>\
the year of drought has left a غَنَم, but not to<br>\
him to whom it has left غَنَمَيْنِ: (TA:) the pl.<br>\
is أَغْنَامٌ, (Msb, K,) [properly a pl. of pauc.,]<br>\
sometimes used, (Msb,) meaning flocks or herds<br>\
of غَنَم, (Msb and TA in art. ابل,) and also غُنُومٌ<br>\
and أَغَانِمُ, (K,) the last used in an ode of Aboo-Jundab El-Hudhalee: (TA:) the dim. is ↓ غُنَيْمَةٌ,<br>\
with ة, because quasi-pl. ns. of the class having<br>\
no sing. from which they are derived, when<br>\
applied to what are not human beings, are constantly fem.; so one says خَمْسٌ مِنَ الغَنَمِ ذُكُورٌ<br>\
[five of sheep, males], making the n. of number<br>\
fem., though one means rams, when it is followed<br>\
by مِنَ الغَنَمِ, for the n. of number is masc. and<br>\
fem. accord. to the word, not accord. to the<br>\
meaning. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In the saying لَا آتِيكَ غَنَمَ الفِزْرِ<br>\
i. e. حَتَّى تَجْتَمِعَ غَنَمُ الفِزْرِ [I will not come to<br>\
thee until the sheep, or goats, of El-Fizr congregate], غنم [with its complement] is made to<br>\
stand in the place of الدَّهْر, [the meaning being,<br>\
I will not come to thee ever,] and is [therefore]<br>\
put in the accus. case as though it were an adv. n.<br>\
[of time]. (TA. [This saying with مِعْزَى in the<br>\
place of غَنَمَ is mentioned by El-Meydánee in his<br>\
“ Proverbs,” and thus in the S and K in art. فزر.<br>\
For an explanation of its origin see Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Prov. ii. 484.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  الأَغْنَامُ is the name of<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Certain small stars between the legs of Cepheus<br>\
and the star الجَدْىُ. (Kzw, in his descr. of<br>\
Cepheus.) [See شَاةٌ (in art. شوه), last sentence.]<br>\
غَنِيمٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
غَنِيمَةٌ and ↓ مَغْنَمٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ غَنِيمٌ and<br>\
↓ غُنْمٌ all signify فَىْءٌ [as meaning Spoil,<br>\
booty, or plunder]: and the acquisition of a thing<br>\
without difficulty, or trouble, or inconvenience: or<br>\
this is termed ↓ غُنْمٌ, and فَىْءٌ is termed غَنِيمَةٌ:<br>\
(K:) or, accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, الغَنِيمَةُ signifies<br>\
what is obtained from the believers in a plurality<br>\
of gods, by force, during war; (Mgh, Msb:)<br>\
and of this, a fifth is to be taken, [and applied in<br>\
the manner prescribed in the Kur viii. 42,] and<br>\
what remains after the fifth is for those who have<br>\
obtained it, exclusively; (Mgh;) the horseman<br>\
having three shares, and the foot-soldier having<br>\
one share: (Az, TA:) and الفَىْءُ signifies what<br>\
is obtained from them after the laying-down of<br>\
arms, (Mgh, Msb,) when the country, or place,<br>\
becomes a country, or place, of Islám; and this<br>\
is for all of the Muslims, and is not to be divided<br>\
into fifths: (Mgh:) or the فَىْء is what God has<br>\
given, or restored, of the possessions of the believers in a plurality of gods, to the Muslims,<br>\
without war, such as the poll-tax, and that for<br>\
which peace has been made with them; and of<br>\
this also a fifth is to be applied in the manner<br>\
prescribed by God, and the remainder is to be<br>\
expended in the purchase of horses and weapons<br>\
and other apparatus for the defence of the<br>\
frontiers: (Az, TA:) and النَّفَلُ is what is given<br>\
to the warrior in addition to his share; and is<br>\
when the Imám or the commander says, “He who<br>\
slays one shall have his spoil; ” or says to a detachment, “What ye obtain shall be yours,” or “ the<br>\
quarter of it,” or “ the half of it; ” and it is not<br>\
divided into fifths; and it lies on the Imám to<br>\
fulfil the promise: or, accord. to &#39;Alee Ibn-&#39;Eesà,<br>\
الغَنِيمَةُ is more general in signification than النَّفَلُ;<br>\
and الفَىْءُ is more so than الغَنِيمَةُ, because it is a<br>\
name for everything of the possessions of the believers in a plurality of gods that becomes the<br>\
property of the Muslims: accord. to the lawyers,<br>\
everything that may be lawfully taken, of their<br>\
possessions, is فَىْء: (Mgh:) the pl. of غَنِيمَةٌ is<br>\
غَنَائِمُ; and the pl. of ↓ مَغْنَمٌ is مَغَانِمُ, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
and غُنُومٌ occurs as pl. of ↓ غُنْمٌ. (TA.) غَنِيمَةٌ<br>\
بَارِدَةٌ see expl. in art. برد.<br>\
غُنِيْمَةٌ dim. of غَنَمٌ, q. v. (S.)<br>\
غُنَامَاكَ أَنْ تَفَعَلَ كَذَا (S, K, * TA) means The<br>\
utmost of thy power, or ability, and of thy case,<br>\
(S, * TA,) and that which thou eagerly desirest<br>\
like as one desires spoil, (S, * JM, TA, *) [is, or<br>\
will be, thy doing such a thing;] i. q. قُصَارَاكَ:<br>\
(K, TA: [see also عُنَانَاكَ, in art. عن:]) and so<br>\
↓ غُنْمُكَ: (TA:) and [in like manner] one says,<br>\
أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا ↓ غُنَيْمَاؤُهُ, like حُسَيْنَاؤُهُ, meaning<br>\
قُصَارَاهُ [The utmost of his power, &amp;c.]. (TA in<br>\
art. حسن.)<br>\
غُنَيْمَاؤُهُ: see what next precedes.<br>\
غَانِمٌ Taking, or a taker, of غَنِيمَة [or spoil].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also two exs. voce شَاجِبٌ.<br>\
مَغْنَمٌ: see غَنِيمَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
غَنَمٌ مُغْنَمَةٌ and مُغَنَّمَةٌ Sheep, or goats, collected<br>\
together: (TA:) or many or numerous: (K,<br>\
TA:) or, accord. to AZ, one of these two<br>\
epithets, thus applied, [probably the latter, like<br>\
مُؤَبَّلَةٌ applied to إِبِلٌ, as he seems to say,] signifies [app. divided into distinct flocks or herds,]<br>\
each [flock or herd] having its own pastor.<br>\
