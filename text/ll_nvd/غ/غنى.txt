غَنِىَ, (S, MA, Msb, K, *) from المَال, aor.<br>\
يَغْنَى, (Msb,) inf. n. غِنًى (S, * MA, Msb, K *)<br>\
and غَنَآءٌ, (MA, K, * TK, [but the latter is app.<br>\
held by some to be a simple subst.,]) He was, or<br>\
became, free from want; in the state, or condition, of having no wants; and also, of having<br>\
few wants; or in a state of competence, or sufficiency; or rich, or wealthy; الغِنَى being the<br>\
contr. of الفَقْرُ, as also الغَنَآءُ; (K, TA;) and<br>\
thus denoting the absence, or non-existence, of<br>\
wants, which is [properly, or strictly speaking,]<br>\
attributable to none but God; and also the<br>\
paucity of wants; (TA;) or syn. with اليَسَارُ:<br>\
(S:) and the epithet applied to him of whom<br>\
this is said is ↓ غَنِىٌّ, (S:) or ↓ غَانٍ, (Msb,) [or<br>\
both, for] both signify the same [as will be shown<br>\
below]. (K.) One says غَنِىَ and ↓ استغنى and<br>\
↓ تغنّى and ↓ تغانى and ↓ اغتنى, (K, TA, [but<br>\
wanting in the CK, and app. in several copies of<br>\
the K, though it is said in one place in the K, as<br>\
it is in the S, that تغنّى is syn. with استغنى,])<br>\
all having one and the same meaning, and<br>\
followed by بِهِ [as therewith signifying He was,<br>\
or became, free from want; in the state, or condition, of having no want, or need; or in a state<br>\
of competence, &amp;c.; by means of it, or him; i. e.<br>\
he was, or became, sufficed by it, or him; and<br>\
hence, he was, or became, content, or satisfied,<br>\
with it, or him]. (TA.) ↓ لَيْسَ مِنَّا مَنْ لَمْ يَتَغَنَّ<br>\
بِالقُرْآنِ, (Msb, TA,) a saying of the Prophet,<br>\
(Msb,) mentioned in a trad., (TA,) means من لم<br>\
↓ يَسْتَغْنِ [i. e. He is not of us who is not content,<br>\
or satisfied, with the Kur-án]: so says Sufyán<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Oyeyneh; not regarding it as meaning the<br>\
utterance of the voice [in chanting]: and A &#39;Obeyd<br>\
says that this obtains extensively in the speech of<br>\
the Arabs; that they say ↓ تَغَنَّيْتُ and ↓ تَغَانَيْتُ<br>\
in the sense of ↓ اِسْتَغْنَيْتُ. (Az, Msb, TA.)<br>\
And one says, غَنِىَ عَنْهُ, inf. n. غِنًى and غُنْيَانٌ,<br>\
meaning He was in no need of it [or him]: as<br>\
also عنه ↓ استغنى; and غنه ↓ أَغْنَى [which<br>\
seems to be rarely used in this sense]: and<br>\
↓ غُنْيَةٌ signifies the state of being in no need: and<br>\
↓ غَانٍِ, a man free from need. (MA.) [And مَا<br>\
عَنْهُ ↓ يَسْتَغْنِى He is not without need, or not free<br>\
from want, of it, or him.] And غَنِىَ بِهِ عَنْهُ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) i. e. عَنْ غَيْرِهِ, (Msb,) inf. n. غُنْيَةٌ, (S,) or<br>\
↓ غُنْيَةٌ is the subst., (Msb,) meaning ↓ استغنى<br>\
[He was sufficed by it, or was satisfied, or content, with it, so as to be in no need, or so as to be<br>\
free from want, of it, i. e. of another thing]: and<br>\
the epithet is ↓ غَنِىٌّ. (Msb.) And [in like<br>\
manner] غَنِيَتِ المَرْأَةُ بِزَوْجِهَا (S, Msb, K) عَنْ غَيْرِهِ,<br>\
(Msb,) inf. n. غُنْيَانٌ (S, K) and غَنَآءٌ also, (TA,)<br>\
meaning ↓ اِسْتَغْنَت [The woman was satisfied, or<br>\
content, with her husband, so as to have no want<br>\
of other than him]. (S, K) And غَنِيَتْ [alone],<br>\
(K, TA,) inf. n. غِنًا [for غِنًى, or perhaps a mistranscription for غَنَآءٌ, as in the next preceding<br>\
sentence], She (a woman) was, or became,<br>\
such as is termed غَانِيَةٌ [q. v. voce غَانٍ].<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  غَنِىَ, (TK,) inf. n. غِنًى, (K, TK,) also<br>\
signifies He married, or took a wife; [as also<br>\
↓ تغنّى; (see Ham p. 226 l. 1, where تَغَنَّتْ<br>\
occurs said of a woman as meaning she married;)]<br>\
syn. تَزَوَّجَ. (K, * TK. [In the K, only the<br>\
inf. n. of the former verb in this sense is mentioned; الغِنَى being there expl. in some copies as<br>\
signifying التَّزَوُّجُ; and in others, التَّزْوِيجُ.])<br>\
Hence the saying, الغِنَى حِصْنٌ لِلْعَزَبِ [Marriage<br>\
is a bulwark to him who has no wife; protecting<br>\
him from the attacks of seductive women by<br>\
rendering him free from the want of them]:<br>\
mentioned by Az. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, غَنِىَ, (S, K,)<br>\
inf. n. غِنًى, (TA,) He dwelt, or abode, (S, K,)<br>\
بِالمَكَانِ in the place: (S:) or غَنِىَ القَوْمُ فِى دَارِهِمْ<br>\
The people, or party, dwelt long in their place of<br>\
abode: (T, TA:) or غَنِىَ فِى مَكَانِ كَذَا He<br>\
dwelt long in such a place, satisfied, or content,<br>\
therewith, so as to be in no need of any other.<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA.) كَأَنْ لَمْ يَغْنَوْا فِيهَا, in the Kur<br>\
[vii. 90 and xi. 71 and 98], means As though<br>\
they had not dwelt therein. (TA.) [See also the<br>\
last sentence but two in this paragraph.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
He lived; syn. عَاشَ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And I. q.<br>\
بَقِىَ: (TA:) one says, غَنِيتُ لَكَ مِنِّى بِالمَوَدَّةِ,<br>\
meaning بَقِيتُ [i. e. I remained, or have remained, constant to thee with my love, or affection]. (ISd, K, TA: in the CK [erroneously]<br>\
غَنَيْتُ.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [And I. q. كَانَ.] قَدْ أَغْنَى الحَبِيبَ<br>\
المُصَافِىَ, in a verse of Ibn-Mukbil, means أَكُونُ<br>\
الحَبِيبَ [i. e. Certainly I will be, or shall be, the<br>\
sincere friend]. (TA.) And غَنِيَتْ دَارُنَا تِهَامَةَ,<br>\
(K, TA,) in a verse of another poet, (TA,)<br>\
means كَانَتْ [i. e. Our place of abode was<br>\
Tihámeh]. (K, TA.) And one says of a thing<br>\
when it has perished, passed away, or come to<br>\
nought, كَأَنْ لَمْ يَغْنَ بِالأَمْسِ, meaning كَأَنْ لَمْ<br>\
يَكُنْ [i. e. As though it had not been in existence<br>\
yesterday]. (Az, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  غَنِىَ also signifies<br>\
لَقِىَ: (K:) [SM doubts this; saying,] thus in<br>\
the copies; but perhaps it should be بَقِىَ, a<br>\
signification of غَنِىَ accord. to ISd and the K<br>\
[and mentioned above]: (TA:) [it appears, however, to be correct; for it is said that] مَا غَنِيتُ<br>\
فُلَانًا means لَمْ أَلْقَهُ [i. e. I did not meet, or meet<br>\
with, or find, or I have not met, &amp;c., such a one].<br>\
(JK.) [Accord. to the TK, غَنِىَ followed by بِهِ<br>\
signifies لَقِى: but this is perhaps said conjecturally.]<br>\
2<br>\
غَنَّىَ see 4.<br>\
-A2-  غنّى, (S, MA, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
تَغْنِيَةٌ, (KL,) as syn. with ↓ تغنّى, (S, MA,<br>\
Msb, *) He sang, or chanted, (S, * MA, KL;) or<br>\
he trilled, or quavered, or prolonged his voice and<br>\
modulated it sweetly, singing, or chanting. (Msb<br>\
in explanation of the former.) You say غنّاهُ الشِّعْرَ<br>\
[He sang, or chanted, to him the poetry], and<br>\
غنّى بِهِ [he sang, or chanted, it, i. e., the poetry],<br>\
inf. n. تَغْنِيَةٌ; and بِهِ ↓ تغنّى; تغنّى and غنّى<br>\
having one and the same meaning. (K, TA.)<br>\
بِالقُرْآنِ ↓ يَتَغَنَّى, in a trad. cited in the first paragraph of art. اذن, means, as expl. by EshSháfi&#39;ee, Reciting [or chanting] the Kur-án with<br>\
a plaintive and gentle voice. (Az, Msb, TA.<br>\
[See also that trad. somewhat differently related<br>\
voce تَرَنَّمَ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  غنّى is also said of a pigeon,<br>\
meaning It [cooed, or] uttered a cry; (K, TA;)<br>\
and so ↓ تغنّى. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  غنّى بِالمَرْأَةِ means<br>\
تَغَزَّلَ بِهَا, (K, TA,) i. e. He mentioned the woman<br>\
[in amatory language, as an object of love,] in<br>\
his poetry: (TA:) and غنّى بِزَيْدٍ He eulogized<br>\
Zeyd: or he satirized him: like ↓ تغنّى in these<br>\
two senses: (K, TA:) in that of eulogizing and<br>\
that of satirizing: or, in the opinion of ISd, both<br>\
of the verbs are used in these two senses and likewise in the sense mentioned immediately before<br>\
them; meaning that he did thus after prolonging<br>\
and modulating his voice; singing, or chanting,<br>\
the same, i. e. the غَزَل and the eulogy and the<br>\
satire. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
غَاْنَىَ see غَنَآءٌ. [From what is there said, it<br>\
seems that غاناهُ signifies He was in no need of<br>\
him, or it; like غَنِىَ عَنْهُ and استغنى عنه: compare تَغَانَوْا.<br>\
-A2-  And app. it signifies also He<br>\
spoke, or talked, to him, i. e. to a child, or boy,<br>\
saying to him what was pleasing to him; for it is<br>\
said that] المُغَانَاةُ means تَكْلِيمُكَ الصَّبِىَّ بِمَا<br>\
يَهْوَى. (JK.)<br>\
4<br>\
اغناهُ He (i. e. God, S, K, TA, [but wanting<br>\
in the CK and app. in several copies of the K,])<br>\
rendered him, or made him to be, in no need, or<br>\
free from want; (S, * MA, K; *) [or in a state<br>\
of competence, or sufficiency;] or possessed of<br>\
wealth; (S, * K, * TA;) [or rich, or wealthy;<br>\
(see 1, first sentence;)] and ↓ غنّاهُ signifies the<br>\
same; (K, TA; [but wanting in the CK and<br>\
app. in several copies of the K;]) or, as some<br>\
say, this latter is [used] in prayer [app. as meaning he said to him, May God enrich thee, or the<br>\
like: compare سَقَّيْتُهُ (“ I said to him, May God<br>\
send down rain to thee ”), and عَقَّرْتُهُ (as expl. in<br>\
art. عقر), &amp;c.]. (TA.) [And اغناهُ عَنْ كَذَا He,<br>\
or it, caused him to be in no need, or free from<br>\
want, of such a thing. (See Ham p. 152.) And<br>\
يُغْنِى عَنْ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا It renders needless thy<br>\
doing such a thing: lit. it causes that there shall<br>\
be no need of thy doing such a thing.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
اغنى عَنْهُ كَذَا Such a thing sufficed him; or stood<br>\
him in stead: whence the saying in the Kur<br>\
[lxix. 28], مَا أَغْنَىعَنِّى مَالِيَهْ [My property has<br>\
not sufficed me, or stood me in stead]: and [in iii. 8<br>\
and lviii. 18 of the same,] لَنْ تُغْنِىَ عَنْهُمْ أَمْوَالُهُمْ<br>\
[Their possessions will not suffice them in lieu of<br>\
God]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or this last means, will<br>\
not defend them from God, i. e. from his punishment. (Jel in iii. 8.) And ↓ أَغْنَيْتُ عَنْكَ مَغْنَى<br>\
فُلَانٍ and ↓ مَغْنَاتَهُ, (S, Msb, K, *) and ↓ مُغْنَى<br>\
فُلَانٍ and ↓ مُغْنَاتَهُ, (S, Mgh, K,) and فُلَانٍ ↓ غَنَآءَ,<br>\
(K,) I sufficed, or satisfied, or contented, thee, or<br>\
I have sufficed, &amp;c., as such a one; or I stood<br>\
thee, or served thee, or I have stood &amp;c., in the<br>\
stead of such a one. (S, * Mgh, Msb, K.) And<br>\
مَا يُغْنِى عَنْكَ هٰذَا This does not suffice, or satisfy,<br>\
or content, thee; or stand thee, or serve thee, in<br>\
any stead; and does not avail, or profit, thee.<br>\
(S.) AZ mentions مَا أَغْنَى فُلَانٌ شَيْئًا, thus, and<br>\
with ع, [i. e. أَعْنَى,] as meaning Such a one did<br>\
not avail, or profit, at all, in a difficult, or an<br>\
arduous, affair or case; and did not suffice for<br>\
such an affair or such a case, or for the supply of<br>\
what was necessary for subsistence. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
And he says also that he heard a man chide his<br>\
slave, and say to him, أَغْنِ عَنِّى وَجْهَكَ بَلْ شَرَّكَ,<br>\
meaning Free me from, and avert from me, [thy<br>\
face, nay, rather,] thy evil, or mischief: and<br>\
hence the phrase شَأْنٌ يُغْنِيهِ, [respecting which<br>\
see the second sentence in art. عنى,] in the Kur<br>\
[lxxx. 37]. (TA.) [Hence also,] وَمَا أُغْنِى عَنْكُمْ<br>\
مِنَ اللّٰهِ مِنْ شَىْءٍ, in the Kur xii. 67, means But<br>\
I do not avert from you, by my saying this, anything decreed to befall you from God: the second<br>\
من is redundant. (Jel.) And one says, أَغْنِ<br>\
عَنِّى كَذَا, meaning Put thou away from me,<br>\
and remove far from me, such a thing: properly<br>\
[أَغْنِنِى عَنْ كَذَا, originally meaning render thou<br>\
me in no need of such a thing,] a phrase of the<br>\
same kind as عَرَضَ الدَّابَّةَ عَلَى المَآءِ [for عَرَضَ<br>\
المَآءَ عَلَى الدَّابَّةِ]. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  أَغْنَى عَنْهُ as intrans.: see 1, former half.<br>\
-A3-  مَا أَغْنَاهُ [How free<br>\
from wants, or how rich, or wealthy, is he!]:<br>\
this and مَا أَفْقَرَهُ are [said to be] anomalous; for<br>\
their [respective] verbs are استغنى and افتقر,<br>\
from either of which the verb of wonder may not<br>\
properly [or regularly] be formed. (S in art. فقر.<br>\
[But see غَنِىَ as syn. with استغنى; and see also<br>\
art. فقر.])<br>\
5<br>\
تَغَنَّىَ see 1, former half, in three places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and<br>\
again in the latter half:<br>\
-A2-  and see also 2, in five<br>\
places.<br>\
6<br>\
تَغَاْنَىَ see 1, former half, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  تَغَانُوْا<br>\
means They were, or became, free from want, one<br>\
of another, or, as we say, of one another. (S, K.)<br>\
El-Mugheereh Ibn-Habnà says,<br>\
عَنْ أَخِيهِ حَيَاتَهُ ↓ كِلَانَا غَنِىٌّ<br>\
وَنَحْنُ إِذَا مُتْنَا أَشَدُّ تَغَانِيَا<br>\
[Each of us is free from want of his brother in<br>\
his life-time; and when we die, we shall be more<br>\
free from such want]. (S.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِغْتَنَىَ see 1, second sentence.<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَغْنَىَ see 1, in seven places.<br>\
-A2-  استغنى اللّٰهَ He<br>\
asked, or begged, God to render him, or make him<br>\
to be, in no need, or free from want; [or in a state<br>\
of competence, or sufficiency;] or rich, or wealthy.<br>\
(K, TA. [But wanting in the CK, and app. in<br>\
several copies of the K.]) Hence the prayer, اَللّٰهُمَّ<br>\
إِنِّىَ أَسْتَغْنِيكَ عَنْ كُلِّ حَارِمٍ وَأَسْتَعِينُكَ [O God, I<br>\
ask Thee to render me in no need of any one who<br>\
refuses to give, and I beg thine aid]. (TA.)<br>\
غَنًى, (K, TA,) with fet-h, and مَقْصُور, (TA,)<br>\
i. q. مَئِنَّةٌ; so in the saying, مَكَانُ كَذَا غَنًى مِنْ<br>\
فُلَانٍ [Such a place is meet, fit, or proper, for<br>\
such a one; as though meaning a place of freedom<br>\
from want]; as also مِنْهُ ↓ مَغْنًى. (K, TA.)<br>\
غِنًى and ↓ غَنَآءٌ signify the same; (MA, K;)<br>\
both are inf. ns. of غَنِىَ: (MA:) [see the first<br>\
sentence of this art.: used as simple substs., they<br>\
mean Freedom from need or want; competence,<br>\
or sufficiency; or richness, or wealthiness:] or<br>\
غِنًى is the inf. n. of غَنِىَ; (Msb;) and ↓ غَنَآءٌ<br>\
signifies competence, or sufficiency; (Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
as in the saying, لَيْسَ عِنْدَهُ غَنَآءٌ He has not competence, or sufficiency: (Msb:) or غَنَآءٌ signifies<br>\
profit, utility, or avail; (S;) and you say, رَجُلٌ<br>\
لَا غَنَآءَ عِنْدَهُ meaning A man who is not profitable<br>\
to any one: (TA voce دَدَانٌ; [and in like manner<br>\
this phrase, occurring in the S voce دَدَانٌ, is expl.<br>\
in the PS:]) and ↓ غُنْوَةٌ signifies the same as غِنًى<br>\
in the saying لِى عَنْهُ غُنْوَةٌ [I have no need of it,<br>\
or him]: (K and TA in art. غنو:) so says Ks:<br>\
but, as ISd says, the word commonly known is<br>\
↓ غُنْيَةٌ; (TA in that art.;) which see in two<br>\
places in the former half of the first paragraph of<br>\
this art.: this last word [said in the S to be an<br>\
inf. n.] and ↓ غِنْيَةٌ and ↓ غُنْوَةٌ and ↓ غُنْيَانٌ [which<br>\
is said in the S and in one place in the K to be<br>\
an inf. n.] are substs. having one and the same<br>\
meaning [syn. with غِنًى used as a simple subst.]:<br>\
and مَا لَه عَنْهُ غِنًى [in the CK erroneously غَنًى]<br>\
and ↓ غُنْيَةٌ and ↓ غُنْيَانٌ and ↓ مَغْنًى mean [lit.<br>\
He has not freedom from need of it, or him;<br>\
and hence,] he has not any means, or way, of<br>\
separating himself from, or avoiding, it, or him;<br>\
syn. بُدٌّ: (K:) and one says عَنِ ↓ فِى النِّكَاحِ غُنْيَةٌ<br>\
السِّفَاحِ [In marriage is freedom from need of<br>\
fornication]. (A and Msb in art. سفح.) مَا<br>\
كَانَ عَنْ ظَهْرِ غِنًى, in a trad. respecting alms,<br>\
means What is over and above that which suffices<br>\
for the sustenance of the household, or family.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
غُنْوَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
غُنْيَةٌ and غِنْيَةٌ: see غِنًى; the former in three<br>\
places.<br>\
غُنْيَانٌ: see غِنًى, latter half, in two places.<br>\
غَنَآءٌ: see غِنًى, in two places; and see also 4,<br>\
former half. A poet says,<br>\
سَيُغْنِينِى الَّذِى أَغْنَاكَ عَنِّى<br>\
فَلَا فَقْرٌ يَدُومُ وَلَا غَنَآءُ<br>\
[He will render me free from need who has rendered thee free from need of me: for poverty will<br>\
not always continue, nor competence, or richness]:<br>\
or, as some relate it, غِنَآءُ, meaning thereby the<br>\
inf. n. of ↓ غَانَيْتُ: [see 3, above:] but it is said<br>\
that the proper reading is غَنَآءُ; because this has<br>\
no other meaning than that of غِنًى: so says ISd.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَا فِيهِ غَنَآءُ ذَاكَ means There is not in<br>\
him [ability for] the setting-up of that, and<br>\
strength, or power, to bear it, or carry it, or to<br>\
raise it upon his back and rise with it. (ISd,<br>\
K, TA.)<br>\
غِنَآءٌ is an inf. n. of 3. (TA, [See the next preceding paragraph.])<br>\
-A2-  Also, (TA,) [Song, or<br>\
vocal music; i. e.] an utterance of the voice with<br>\
a prolonging and a sweet modulation thereof; (K,<br>\
TA;) or a raising of the voice, and continuing it<br>\
without interruption; (Nh, TA;) [a singing, and<br>\
a chanting;] it is said in the S to be مِنَ السَّمَاعِ<br>\
[meaning that it is a sort of musical performance]: (TA:) being an utterance of the voice, its<br>\
analogical form would be with damm [i. e. غُنَآءٌ,<br>\
like حُدَادٌ &amp;c.]: (Msb, TA:) its pl. is أَغْنِيَةٌ:<br>\
(MA:) [and ↓ مَغْنًى signifies the same as غِنَآءٌ;<br>\
and a mode of singing; and any particular air,<br>\
or tune; and a song, i. e. a composition in verse<br>\
that is sung or to be sung: and its pl. is مَغَانٍ:<br>\
but perhaps it is post-classical: the pl. occurs in<br>\
the K, in art. نصب:] غِنَآءٌ [also] signifies [a song,<br>\
i. e.] poetry, or verse, that is [sung, or chanted,<br>\
or] uttered with a trilling, or quavering, or a prolonging and a sweet modulation, of the voice; (Har<br>\
p. 286;) and ↓ أُغْنِيَّةٌ is syn. with غِنَآءٌ (S, Har) in<br>\
this sense; (Har;) or, as also ↓ إِغْنِيَّةٌ, (Fr, K,<br>\
TA,) and ↓ each of them also without teshdeed,<br>\
(K, TA,) as mentioned by ISd, but said by him<br>\
to be not of valid authority, (TA,) signifies a<br>\
certain sort of غِنَآء (K, TA) which they sing or<br>\
chant: (TA:) and the pl. is أَغَانِىُّ (S, TA) [and<br>\
أَغَانٍ, this latter being the pl. of each sing. that is<br>\
without teshdeed]. ―<br>\
-b2-  الغِنَآء is also used by a poet<br>\
in the place of an inf. n., meaning التَّغَنِّى: he<br>\
says,<br>\
تَغَنِّ بِالشِّعْرِ إِمَّا كُنْتَ قَائِلَهُ<br>\
إِنَّ الغِنَآءَ بهٰذَا الشِعْرِ مِضْمَارُ<br>\
[Sing thou, or chant thou, the poetry, if thou be<br>\
uttering it: verily the singing, or chanting, this<br>\
poetry is a مضمار (expl. in art. ضمر)]. (TA.)<br>\
غَنِىٌّ and ↓ غَانٍ: see 1, former half; each in<br>\
two places: both signify [Free from want; or<br>\
in a state of competence, or sufficiency; or rich,<br>\
or wealthy; or] possessing much property or<br>\
wealth: (K, * TA:) pl. of the former أَغْنِيَآءُ.<br>\
(Msb, TA.) See an ex. of the former in a verse<br>\
cited above, conj. 6. One says, أَنَا غَنِىٌّ بِكَذَا عَنْ<br>\
غَيْرِهِ [I am sufficed by such a thing, or satisfied,<br>\
or content, with it, so as to be free from want of<br>\
another thing]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الغَنِىُّ as a name of<br>\
God signifies [The Self-sufficient; i. e.] He who<br>\
has no need of any one in any thing. (TA.)<br>\
غَنَّآءٌ A singer; (MA;) [as also ↓ مُغَنٍّ; and<br>\
مُغَنِّيَةٌ a female singer, a songstress:] accord. to<br>\
Ibn-Ya&#39;eesh, a ↓ مُغَنٍّ is thus called لِأَنَّهُ يُغَنِّنُ<br>\
صَوْتَهُ, i. e. because he makes his voice to have in<br>\
it a غُنَّة [or sort of nasal sound, or twang]; the<br>\
word being, in his opinion, originally, مُغَنِّنٌ,<br>\
with three ن, the last of which is changed into<br>\
ى, when one says المُغَنِّى, for the purpose of<br>\
alleviating the utterance. (Mughnee, art. حَرْفُ<br>\
النُّونِ.)<br>\
غَانٍ: see غَنِىٌّ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [The fem.] غَانِيَةٌ signifies<br>\
A young woman who is sufficed by her husband;<br>\
or satisfied, or content, with him, (S, Msb, TA, *)<br>\
so as to be in no need, or free from want, of any<br>\
other: (Msb:) and sometimes, also, applied to a<br>\
woman, (S,) such as is sufficed by her beauty, (S,<br>\
ISd, K, TA,) so as to be in no need of decoration<br>\
(ISd, K, TA) with women&#39;s ornaments: (ISd,<br>\
TA:) or such as is sought, or desired, by men,<br>\
but does not seek, or desire: (ISd, K, * TA:) or<br>\
such as has abode in the house, or tent, of her<br>\
father and mother, and whom captivity (سِبَآء)<br>\
has not befallen; (IJ, ISd, K, * TA;) which is<br>\
the strangest of the explanations: (TA:) or such<br>\
as is youthful and chaste, whether having a husband or not: (ISd, K, TA:) or, accord. to AO,<br>\
one that is married: (Ham p. 226:) or, accord.<br>\
to Az, such as pleases men, and is pleased by شَبَاب<br>\
[which means both youthfulness and youths or<br>\
young men]: (TA:) pl. غَوَانٍ; (K;) with the<br>\
article, الغَوَانِى; [and also غَانِيَاتٌ: (see an ex. in<br>\
a verse cited in the second paragraph of art. زج:)]<br>\
in the saying of Ibn-Er-Rukeiyát,<br>\
لَا بَارَكَ اللّٰهُ فِى الغَوَانِىِ هَلْ<br>\
يُصْبِحْنَ إِلَّا لَهُنَّ مُطَّلَبُ<br>\
[May God not bless those young women that are<br>\
sufficed by their husbands, or by their beauty, &amp;c.:<br>\
do they enter upon the time of dawn without their<br>\
having desire (lit. a time or place, meaning an<br>\
occasion, of seeking, or desire) ?], the ى is made<br>\
movent by a poetic license: (S, TA:) and another<br>\
poet uses الغَوَانِ for الغَوَانِى. (TA.)<br>\
أَغْنَآءٌ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned,]<br>\
The أَمْلَاكَات [meaning Goods and chattels, or<br>\
paraphernalia,] of brides. (Az, K.)<br>\
أُغْنِيَّةٌ and إِغْنِيَّةٌ, and each of them also without<br>\
teshdeed: see غِنَآءٌ, latter half.<br>\
مَغْنًى: see 4, former half: ―<br>\
-b2-  and غَنًى: ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
and غِنًى, near the end. ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A place in which<br>\
were its occupants, or inhabitants: (S:) or a place<br>\
of abode by which its occupants, or inhabitants,<br>\
were sufficed, or with which they were satisfied, or<br>\
content, and from which they then departed, or<br>\
removed: or in a general sense; (K, TA;) a place<br>\
of abode, absolutely; but this seems to be a distinct application: (TA:) pl. مَغَانٍ; with the<br>\
article, المَغَانِى. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also غِنَآءٌ.<br>\
مُغْنًى: see 4, former half.<br>\
مُغْنٍ [act. part. n. of 4,] A man sufficing, or<br>\
satisfying, or contenting. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  المُغْنِى as a<br>\
name of God signifies He who satisfies, or contents, whom He will, of his servants. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And مُغْنِيَةٌ A woman who satisfies, or contents,<br>\
her husband, so as to render him in no need of<br>\
looking at other than her. (Har p. 451.)<br>\
مَغْنَاةٌ and مُغْنَاةٌ: see 4, former half.<br>\
مُغَنٍّ; fem. مُغَنِّيَةٌ see غَنَّآءٌ, in two places.<br>\
