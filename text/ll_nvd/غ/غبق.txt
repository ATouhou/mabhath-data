بَارِدًا [If thou be tying, then mayest thou drink a<br>\
cold evening-draught]; meaning, may there not<br>\
be milk for thee, so that thou shalt drink water<br>\
not mixed with anything; this being called by<br>\
him غبوق by way of comparison: or meaning,<br>\
may that be to thee in the place of غبوق. (TA.)<br>\
And one says, لَقَيتُهُ ذَا غَبُوقٍ [lit. I met him at a<br>\
time of drinking the evening-draught], meaning,<br>\
in the evening; a phrase used only adverbially;<br>\

a similar meaning]. (T in art. ذُو.) ―<br>\

with ة, A she-camel whose milk one drinks in the<br>\
