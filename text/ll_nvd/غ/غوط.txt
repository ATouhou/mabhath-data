غَاطَ, aor. يَغُوطُ, (S, Msb, TA,) inf. n. غَوْطٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) It entered, or sank, (S, Msb, K,<br>\
TA,) into (فِى) a thing; (S, K, TA;) as, for instance, the foot into sand; (S, TA;) and a man<br>\
into mud, (TA,) or into water; (Msb;) and into<br>\
a valley; (TA, in this art. and in art. غيط; in<br>\
the former expl. by اِنْغَمَسَ;) and غَاطَ, aor. يَغِيطُ,<br>\
(S, TA,) inf. n. غَيْطٌ, (K,) signifies the same: (S,<br>\
K:) both also signify he, or it, became hidden,<br>\
(As, and K in art. غيط,) in the ground. (As.)<br>\
You say also, غَاطَتْ أَنْسَاعُ النَّاقَةِ, aor. and inf. n.<br>\
as above, The plaited thongs of the she-camel clave<br>\
to her belly, and so entered, or sank, therein.<br>\
(TA.) And غَاطَتِ الأَنْسَاعُ فِى دَفِّ النَّاقَةِ The<br>\
plaited thongs caused their impressions to be visible<br>\
in the side of the she-camel. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It (a place)<br>\
sank, or became depressed, in the ground. (ISh.)<br>\
And It (anything) descended, or sloped downwards, in the ground. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, aor. and<br>\
inf. n. as above, He dug, excavated, or hollowed<br>\
out. (TA: and in some copies of the K, الغَوْطُ is<br>\
expl. by الحَفْرُ; but the reading given in the TA,<br>\
in that instance, is الحُفْرَةُ.)<br>\
-A2-  غُطْ غُطْ means Be<br>\
thou with the جَمَاعَة [i. e. the mass, or main body],<br>\
(IAar, O, K,) who are termed the غَاط, (O,) [be<br>\
thou with them, not with the factious,] when فِتَن<br>\
[i. e. factions, &amp;c.,] come. (IAar, O, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
غوّط, inf. n. تَغْوِيطٌ, He gobbled [food]:<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K: *) or gobbled largely, or in<br>\
large mouthfuls: (K, * TA:) from غَوْطٌ meaning<br>\
ثَرِيد. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And تَغْوِيطٌ signifies also The<br>\
making a well deep. (K. [See also 4.])<br>\
4<br>\
أَغْوَطَ He made deep a well. (Fr, O, TA.<br>\
[See also 2.])<br>\
5<br>\
تغوّط (tropical:)  He voided excrement, or ordure. (S,<br>\
Msb, K, TA. [In the CK, اَنْدىٰ is put by<br>\
mistake for ابدى.])<br>\
6<br>\
تَغَاوَطَا فِى المَآءِ They two vied, or contended,<br>\
each with the other, in plunging, or diving, in the<br>\
water. (K, * TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انغاط It (a branch, or twig, or the like,)<br>\
bent. (O, K.)<br>\
غَاطٌ: see غَائِطٌ.<br>\
-A2-  الغَاطُ signifies also الجَمَاعَةُ<br>\
[meaning The mass, or main body, of the people].<br>\
(O, K.) One says, مَا فِى الغَاطِ مِثْلُهُ [There is<br>\
not in the mass, or main body, of the people, the<br>\
like of him]. (O, TA.)<br>\
غَوْطٌ A hollow, cavity, pit, or the like, dug, or<br>\
excavated, in the ground; syn. حُفْرَةٌ. (So in the<br>\
K, accord. to the TA, on the authority of AA:<br>\
but in some copies of the K, الغَوْطُ in this instance<br>\
is expl. by الحَفْرُ: see 1, last sentence.) See also<br>\
غَائِطُ.<br>\
-A2-  And i. q. ثَرِيدٌ [Crumbled bread moistened with broth]. (O: in the K ثَرِيدَة.)<br>\
غَيْطٌ: see غَائِطٌ, latter half.<br>\
غَوْطَةٌ A [low, or depressed, place, or hollow,<br>\
such as is called] وَهْدَة, in the ground. (ISh, K.)<br>\
[See also غَائِطٌ.]<br>\
غُوطَةٌ A place comprising water and herbage:<br>\
whence غُوطَةُ دِمَشْقَ, (Har pp. 130, et seq.,) i. e.<br>\
the city, or district, of Damascus, (K,) which is<br>\
a place abounding with water and trees. (S.)<br>\
بِئْرٌ غَوِيطَةٌ A deep well. (TA.)<br>\
غَائِطٌ A wide, depressed piece of ground or land,<br>\
(ISh, S, O, Msb, K,) but not much depressed, and<br>\
in some instances having acclivities [bordering it];<br>\
(ISh;) sometimes, as they assert, a league (فَرْسَخ)<br>\
in extent, and having in it meadows; (AHn;)<br>\
and ↓ غَاطٌ and ↓ غَوْطٌ signify the same; (O, K;)<br>\
or the last is more depressed than the غائط:<br>\
(IDrd, O:) and غائط is also applied to a valley:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. [of pauc.] is أَغْوَاطٌ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
or this is pl. of غَوْطٌ, (IB,) and [of mult.] غِيطَانٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) which is pl. of both these sings.,<br>\
(IB,) and غُوطٌ (S, Msb, K) and غِيَاطٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, (tropical:)  A place in which one satisfies a want of<br>\
nature; the custom being to do so in a depressed<br>\
place, where one is concealed. (S, * Msb, * TA.)<br>\
In the Kur [iv. 46, or v. 9], accord. to an extraordinary reading, it is written ↓ غَيْط, [a form now<br>\
commonly used, and signifying a garden, but<br>\
there meaning a privy place,] the original form of<br>\
which may be غَيْوِط, and then غَيِّط, [and then<br>\
غَيْط,] it being contracted; or, accord. to Abu-l-<br>\
Hasan, the ى may be originally و, these two<br>\
letters being in this instance interchangeable.<br>\
(IJ.) You say, أَتَى الغَائِطَ, (S, TA,) and ضَرَبَ<br>\
الغَائِطَ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He satisfied a want of nature;<br>\
(S, TA;) voided excrement, or ordure. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, (S, TA,) (tropical:)  Human excrement, or<br>\
ordure: (S, K, TA:) because they used to cast<br>\
it away in a غائط: or because they used to go<br>\
thither to satisfy a want of nature. (TA.)<br>\
