-b4-  Hence, (TA,)<br>\
إِغْرَابٌ signifies also Abundance of wealth, and<br>\
goodliness of condition: (K, TA:) because abundance of wealth fills the hands of the possessor<br>\
thereof, and goodliness of condition fills [with<br>\
satisfaction] the soul of the goodly person. (TA.)<br>\
[Therefore the verb, meaning He was endowed<br>\
(as though filled) with abundance of wealth and<br>\

is implied in the TK) أَغْرَبَ: the explanation of<br>\

goodly.] ―<br>\

some other cause. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And أُغْرِبَ عَلَيْهِ,<br>\

was done to him; and [it is said that] أُغْرِبَ بِهِ<br>\
signifies the same: but in other works, [the verb<br>\
must app. be in the act. form, for] the explanation<br>\
is, he did [to him] a foul, or an evil, deed. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  And أُغْرِبَ said of a horse, His blaze spread<br>\
(S, K) so that it took in his eyes, and the edges of<br>\
his eyelids were white: and it is used in like<br>\

TA.) See its part. n., مُغْرَبٌ.<br>\

west. (K.)<br>\

اغترب: see 5. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He married to one<br>\
not of his kindred. (S, K.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\

remoteness, of the place which one purposes to<br>\
reach in his journey. (S, TA.) ―<br>\

نَوًى غَرْبَةٌ [in one of my copies of the S غُرْبَةٌ] A<br>\
distant, or remote, place which one purposes to<br>\

pronounced ↓ المَغْرَبُ, with fet-h to the ر, but<br>\
more commonly with kesr, (Msb,) or accord. to<br>\
analogy it should be with fet-h, but usage has<br>\
given it kesr, as in the case of المَشْرِقُ; (TA;)<br>\
[both signify The west;] الغَرْبُ is the contr. of<br>\
الشَّرْقُ; (M, TA;) and ↓ المَغْرِبُ [is the contr. of<br>\
المَشْرِقُ, and] originally signifies the place [or<br>\

(Msb:) of the masc. gender: pl. غُرُوبٌ. (TA.)<br>\
So expl. in the following words of a trad.: أَخَذَ<br>\
الدَّلْوَ عُمَرُ فَاسْتَحَالَتْ غَرْبًا [&#39;Omar took the دلو, and<br>\
it became changed into a غرب]; i. e. when he<br>\

called] رَاوِيَة, (K, TA,) upon which water is carried. (TA.) ―<br>\

[What aileth thee, that thou dost not mention<br>\
Umm-&#39;Amr but thine eyes have tears flowing?].<br>\
(S, TA.) And it is said of Ibn-&#39;Abbás, in a trad.,<br>\
كَانَ مِثَجًّا يَسِيلُ غَرْبًا i. e. (tropical:)  [He was an eloquent<br>\
orator, flowing with] a copious and uninterrupted<br>\
stream of knowledge, likened to غَرْب as meaning<br>\
“ tears coming forth from the eye. ” (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\

what is termed نَاسُورٌ. (S, Mgh.) One says of<br>\
a person whose tears flow without intermission,<br>\
بَعَيْنِهِ غَرْبٌ. (As, S, Mgh.) And [the pl.] الغُرُوبُ<br>\
signifies The channels of the tears. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also<br>\

thereof. (S, A, K.) ―<br>\

-b6-  And A pustule (بَثْرَةٌ) in the<br>\
eye, (K, TA,) which discharges blood, and the<br>\
bleeding of which will not be stopped. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
And Abundance of saliva (K, TA) in the mouth;<br>\
(TA;) and the moisture thereof, i. e., of saliva: (K:)<br>\
pl. غُرُوبٌ. (TA.) And The place where the saliva<br>\
collects and remains: (K, TA:) or the غَرْب in a<br>\
tooth is the place where the saliva thereof collects<br>\
and remains: (TA:) or غَرْبٌ, (TA,) or its pl.<br>\
غُرُوبٌ, (S, TA,) signifies the sharpness, and مَآء<br>\

of the teeth: (S, TA:) accord. to the T and M<br>\
and Nh and L, غُرُوبُ الأَسْنَانِ signifies the places<br>\
where the saliva of the teeth collects and remains:<br>\
or, as some say, their extremities and sharpness<br>\

(TA:) or their مَآء, and shining whiteness: (A,<br>\
TA:) or their fineness, or thinness, and sharpness: or غُرُوبٌ signifies the sharp, or serrated,<br>\
edges of the fore teeth: it is also, as pl. of غَرْبٌ,<br>\
expl. as signifying the مَآء of the فَم [by which may<br>\
be meant either the water of the mouth or the<br>\
lustre of the teeth, for الفَمُ properly signifies “ the<br>\
mouth ” and metonymically “ the teeth ”], and<br>\
the sharpness of the teeth: and accord. to MF, as<br>\
on the authority of the Nh, [but SM expresses<br>\
a doubt as to its correctness,] it is also applied to<br>\
the teeth [themselves]. (TA.) [See also شَنَبٌ,<br>\
in two places.]<br>\
-A6-  أَصَابَهُ سَهْمُ غَرْبٍ and ↓ سَهْمُ غَرَبٍ,<br>\
and سَهْمٌ غَرْبٌ and ↓ سَهْمٌ غَرَبٌ, (S, Msb, * K,) the<br>\
second of which, i. e. ↓ سَهْمُ غَرَبٍ, accord. to IKt,<br>\
is the most approved, (MF,) mean An arrow of<br>\
which the shooter was not known [struck him]:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) or, accord. to some, سهم غَرْب signifies an arrow from an unknown quarter; سهم<br>\
↓ غَرَب, an arrow that is shot and that strikes<br>\

-A7-  And غَرْبٌ signifies also A<br>\

made [or prepared] the كُحَيْل [i. e. tar] with<br>\
which [mangy] camels are smeared: [or it is a<br>\
coll. gen. n., for] its n. un. is with ة: so says<br>\
ISd: كحيل is قَطِرَان, of the dial. of El-Hijáz:<br>\
and he [app. ISd] says also, the أَبْهَل [q. v.] is<br>\
the same as the غَرْب, because قطران is extracted<br>\
from it. (TA.) Hence, as some say, (K, TA,)<br>\
the trad., (TA,) لَا يَزَالُ أَهْلُ الغَرْبِ ظَاهِرِينَ عَلَى<br>\
الحَقِّ [The people of the غرب will not cease to be<br>\
attainers of the truth, or of the true religion]:<br>\
(K, TA:) or the meaning is, the people of Syria,<br>\
because Syria is [a little to the] west of El-Hijáz:<br>\
or the people of sharpness, and of vehemence of<br>\
might or strength, or of valour or prowess; i. e.<br>\
the warriors against unbelievers: or the people of<br>\
the bucket called غَرْب; i. e. the Arabs: or the<br>\
people of the west; which meaning is considered<br>\
by Iyád and others the most probable, because,<br>\
in the relation of the trad. by Ed-Dárakutnee, the<br>\
word in question is المَغْرِب. (L, TA.)<br>\
غُرْبٌ: see غُرْبَةٌ.<br>\
غَرَبٌ Silver: or a [vessel such as is termed] جَام<br>\
of silver; (S, K;) [i. e.] a [drinking-cup or bowl<br>\
such as is termed] قَدَح of silver. (L, TA.) A<br>\
poet says,<br>\
فَدَعْدَعَا سُرَّةَ الرَّكَآءِ كَمَا<br>\
دَعْدَعَ سَاقِى الأَعَاجِمِ الغَرَبَا<br>\
cited in the S as being by El-Aashà but it is<br>\
said in the L, IB says, this verse is by Lebeed,<br>\
not by El-Aashà, describing two torrents meeting<br>\
together; meaning, And they filled the middle of<br>\
the valley of Er-Rehà, also, but less correctly,<br>\
called Er-Rikà, like as the cup-bearer of the<br>\
اعاجم [or foreigners] fills the silver قَدَح with<br>\
wine: the verse of El-Aashà in which [it is said<br>\
that] غَرَب occurs as meaning “ silver ” is,<br>\
إِذَا انْكَبَّ أَزْهَرُ بَيْنَ السُّقَاةِ<br>\
تَرَامَوْا بِهِ غَرَبًا وَنُضَارَا<br>\
i. e. When a white wine-jug is turned down so as<br>\
to pour out its contents [among the cup-bearers],<br>\
they hand it, i. e. the wine in the cups, one to<br>\
another [while it resembles silver or gold]: (L,<br>\
TA:) غَرَبًا is here in the accus. case as a denotative of state, though signifying a substance: [and<br>\
so نُضَارَا:] but it is said that غَرَبٌ and نُضَارٌ signify<br>\
species of trees from which are made [drinkingcups or bowls such as are termed] أَقْدَاح [pl. of<br>\
قَدَحٌ]: and it is said in the T that نُضَارٌ signifies<br>\
a species of trees from which are made yellow<br>\
أَقْدَاح. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [In explanation of the last of<br>\
the applications of غَرَبٌ mentioned above, it is<br>\
said that] it signifies also A species of trees (T,<br>\
S, ISd, TA) from which are made white [drinking-cups or bowls of the kind termed] أَقْدَاح; (T,<br>\
TA;) called in Pers. إِسبِيدْ دَار [or إِسْپِيدَار]: (S:)<br>\
[generally held to mean the willow; like the<br>\
Hebr.<br>\
עֲרָבִי�; or particularly the species called<br>\
salix Babylonica: a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. with ة.<br>\
(ISd, TA.) [Avicenna (Ibn-Seenà), in book ii.<br>\
p. 279, mentions a tree called غرب, but describes<br>\
only the uses and supposed properties of its bark<br>\
&amp;c., particularizing its صَمْغ; whence it appears<br>\
that he means the غَرْب, not the غَرَب.] ―<br>\
-b3-  It also<br>\
signifies A [vessel of the kind termed] قَدَح [perhaps such as is made from the species of trees<br>\
above mentioned]: (K, TA:) and its pl. is أَغْرَابٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And Gold. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And Wine. (S,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And The water that drops from the<br>\
buckets between the well and the watering-trough<br>\
or tank, (S, K,) and which soon alters in odour:<br>\
(S:) or any water that pours from the buckets<br>\
from about the mouth of the well to the wateringtrough or tank, and that soon alters in odour: or<br>\
the water and mud that are around the well and<br>\
the watering-trough or tank: (TA:) and (as<br>\
some say, TA) the odour of water and mud:<br>\
(K:) so called because it soon alters. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence] one says, لا تغرب, [thus in the TA, so<br>\
that it may be ↓ لا تَغْرُبْ or ↓ لا تُغَرِّبْ or ↓ لا تُغْرِبْ,]<br>\
meaning Spill not thou the water between the well<br>\
and the watering-trough or tank, so as to make<br>\
mud. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain disease in sheep<br>\
or goats, (S, K,) like the سَعَف in the she-camel,<br>\
in consequence of which the hair of the خُرْطُوم<br>\
[i. e. nose, or fore part of the nose,] and that of<br>\
the eyes fall off. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [A colour such<br>\
as is termed] زَرَق [q. v.] in the eye of a horse,<br>\
(K, TA,) together with whiteness thereof. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  See also غَرْبٌ, latter half, in five places.<br>\
غُرُبٌ: see غَرِيبٌ.<br>\
غَرْبَةٌ: see غَرْبٌ, former half, in three places.<br>\
غُرْبَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ غُرْبٌ (K) [as simple substs.<br>\
The state, or condition, of a stranger or foreigner:<br>\
but originally both are, app., inf. ns. of غَرُبَ, like<br>\
قُرْبَةٌ and قُرْبٌ of قَرُبَ, signifying] the being far,<br>\
or distant, from one&#39;s home, or native country;<br>\
(K;) i. q. اِغْتِرَابٌ (S, K) and تَغَرُّبٌ. (K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also, the former, Pure, or unmixed, whiteness.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) [See مُغْرَبٌ.]<br>\
غَرْبِىٌّ [Of, or relating to, the west, or place of<br>\
sunset; western]: see غَارِبٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also,] applied<br>\
to trees (شَجَرٌ), Smitten, or affected, by the sun<br>\
at the time of its setting. (K.) [Respecting the<br>\
meaning of its fem. in the Kur xxiv. 35, see<br>\
شَرْقِىٌّ.]<br>\
-A2-  And A sort of dates: (K:) but<br>\
accord. to AHn, the word is غُرَابِىٌّ [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And The [sort of] نَبِيذ that is termed فَضِيخ<br>\
[i. e. a beverage made from crushed unripe dates<br>\
without being put upon the fire]: (K, TA:) or<br>\
[a beverage] prepared only from fresh ripe dates;<br>\
the drinker of which ceases not to possess selfrestraint as long as the wind does not blow upon<br>\
him; but if he goes forth into the air, and the<br>\
wind blows upon him, his reason departs: wherefore one of its drinkers says,<br>\
إِنْ لَمْ يَكُنْ غَرْبِيُّكُمْ جَيِّدًا<br>\
فَنَحْنُ بِاللّٰهِ وَبِالرِّيحِ<br>\
[If your gharbee be not excellent, we (put our<br>\
trust) in God and in the wind]. (AHn, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And A certain red صِبْغ [i. e. dye, or perhaps<br>\
sauce, or fluid seasoning]. (K.)<br>\
غَرْبِيبٌ One of the most excellent kinds of grapes;<br>\
(K;) a sort of grapes growing at Et-Táïf, in-<br>\
tensely black, of the most exceuent, and most delicate, and blackest, of grapes. (TA.) [See an ex.<br>\
in a verse cited voce عَجِيبَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to an<br>\
old man, Intensely black [app. in the hair]: or<br>\
whose hair does not become white, or hoary:<br>\
(TA:) or, so applied, who blackens his white, or<br>\
hoary, hair with dye: (K, TA:) occurring in a<br>\
trad., in which it is said that God hates such an<br>\
old man: pl. غَرَابِيبُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَسْوَدُ غِرْبِيبٌ<br>\
means Intensely black: but if you say غَرَابِيبُ<br>\
سُودٌ, you make the latter word a substitute for<br>\
the former; because a word corroborative of one<br>\
signifying a colour cannot precede; (S, K;) nor<br>\
can the corroborative of any word: (Suh, MF:)<br>\
or, accord. to Hr, غَرَابِيبُ سُودٌ [in the Kur xxxv.<br>\
25], relating to mountains, means Streaks having<br>\
black rocks. (TA.)<br>\
غُرَابٌ A certain black bird, (TA,) well known;<br>\
(K, TA;) [the corvus, or crow;] of which there<br>\
are several species; [namely, the raven, carrioncrow, rook, jackdaw, jay, magpie, &amp;c.:] and it<br>\
was used as a proper name, which, as is said in<br>\
a trad., he [i. e. Mohammad] changed, because<br>\
the word implies the meaning of distance, and<br>\
because it is the name of a foul bird: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. [of mult.] is غِرْبَانٌ (S, Msb, K) and غُرْبٌ<br>\
(K) and (of pauc., S) أَغْرِبَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
أَغْرُبٌ; (Msb, K;) and pl. pl. غَرَابِينُ. (K.)<br>\
When the Arabs characterize a land as fertile,<br>\
they say, وَقَعَ فِى أَرْضٍ لَا يُطَيَّرُ غُرَابُهَا (tropical:)  [He lighted<br>\
upon a land of which the crow will not be made to<br>\
fly away; because of its abundant herbage: see<br>\
also طَيَّرَ]: and وَجَدَ ثَمَرَةَ الغُرَابِ (assumed tropical:)  [He found the<br>\
fruit of the crow]; because that bird seeks after<br>\
and chooses the most excellent of fruits. (TA.)<br>\
They also say, طَارَ غُرَابُ فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  [The crow of such<br>\
a one flew away], meaning the head of such a one<br>\
became white, or hoary. (A, TA. [See also a<br>\
similar phrase below.]) Also, فُلَانٌ أَبْصَرُ مِنْ<br>\
غُرَابٍ [Such a one is more sharp-sighted than a<br>\
crow]: and أَحْذَرُ [more cautious]: and أَزْهَى<br>\
[more proud]: and أَشْأَمُ [more inauspicious]:<br>\
&amp;c.: they say that this bird is more inauspicious<br>\
than any other inauspicious thing upon the earth.<br>\
(TA.) In the phrase ↓ غُرَابٌ غَارِبٌ, the epithet is<br>\
added to give intensiveness to the signification.<br>\
(TA.) غُرَابُ البَيْنِ has been expl. in art. بين. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
الغُرَابُ is the name of (assumed tropical:)  One of the southern constellations, [i. e. Corvus,] consisting of seven stars<br>\
[in the enumeration of Ptolemy], behind البَاطِيَة<br>\
[which is Crater], to the south of السِّمَاكُ الأَعْزَلُ<br>\
[i. e. Spica Virginis]. (Kzw.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَغْرِبَةُ العَرَبِ is<br>\
an appellation of (assumed tropical:)  The blacks [lit. crows] of the<br>\
Arabs; the black Arabs: (K, TA:) likened to<br>\
the birds called اغربة, in respect of their complexion: (TA:) in all of them the blackness was<br>\
derived from their mothers. (MF, TA.) The<br>\
أَغْرِبَة in the Time of Ignorance were &#39;Antarah and<br>\
Khufáf Ibn-Nudbeh (asserted to have been a<br>\
Mukhadram, TA) and Aboo-&#39;Omeyr Ibn-El-<br>\
Hobáb and Suleyk Ibn-Es-Sulakeh (a famous<br>\
runner, TA) and Hishám Ibn-&#39;Okbeh-Ibn-AbeeMo&#39;eyt; but this last was a Mukhadram: and<br>\
those among the Islámees, &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Khá-<br>\
zim and &#39;Omeyr Ibn-Abee-&#39;Omeyr and Hemmám<br>\
[in the CK Humám] Ibn-Mutarrif and Munteshir<br>\
Ibn-Wahb and Matar Ibn-Abee-Owfà and Taäbbata-Sharrà and Esh-Shenfarà and Hájiz; to the<br>\
last of whom is given no appellation of the kind<br>\
called “ nisbeh,” (K, TA,) in relation to father,<br>\
mother, tribe, or place. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  رِجْلُ الغُرَابِ<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  A certain herb, called in the language<br>\
of the Barbar إِطْرِيلَال, (K, TA,) and in the<br>\
present day زِرُّ الأَخِلَّةِ, (MF,) resembling the شِبِثّ<br>\
[q. v., variously written in different copies of the<br>\
K,] in its stem and in its جُمَّة [or node whence the<br>\
flower grows] and in its lower part, or root,<br>\
except that its flower is white, and it forms grains<br>\
like those of the مَقْدُونِس [app. scandix cerefolium<br>\
or apium petroselinum], (K, TA,) nearly: (TA:)<br>\
a drachm of its seeds, bruised, and mixed with<br>\
honey (K, TA) deprived of its froth, (TA,) is<br>\
a tried medicine for eradicating [the species of<br>\
leprosy which are called] the بَرَص and the بَهَق,<br>\
being drunk; and sometimes is added to it a<br>\
quarter of a drachm of عَاقِرْ قَرْحَا, (K, TA,) which<br>\
is [commonly] known by the name of عود القرح<br>\
[i. e. عُودُ القَرْحِ, both of these being names now<br>\
applied to pyrethrum, i. e. pellitory of Spain, but<br>\
the latter, accord. to Forskål (Flora Ægypt. Arab.<br>\
p. cxix.), applied in El-Yemen to the cacalia sonchifolia, or to a species of senecio]; (TA;) the<br>\
patient sitting in a hot sun, with the diseased<br>\
parts uncovered: (K, TA:) [see also رِجْلٌ: now<br>\
applied to the chelidonium hybridum of Linn.,<br>\
chelidonium dodecandrum of Forsk.: (Delile&#39;s<br>\

Dict. Français-Arabe, both the names of رجل<br>\
الغراب and اطريلال are given to the plants called<br>\
cerfeuil (or chervil) and corne de cerf (or buck&#39;shorn plantain, also called coronopus).] ―<br>\
-b5-  Also<br>\
(i. e. رِجْلُ الغُرَابِ) A certain mode of binding the<br>\
udder of a camel, (S, K,) tightly, (S,) so that the<br>\
young one cannot suck; (K;) nor will it undo.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence] one says, صُرَّ عَلَيْهِ رِجْلُ الغُرَابِ,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  The affair was, or became, difficult, or<br>\
strait, to him: (A, * K:) or his life, or subsistence,<br>\
was, or became, so. (TA.) [And in like manner<br>\
one says also أَصَرَّ, accord. to the TA: but this I<br>\
think doubtful; believing that أَصَرَّ is a mistranscription for صَرَّ, meaning that one says also صَرَّ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ رِجْلَ الغُرَابِ i. e. He bound him with a bond<br>\
not to be undone, or that would not undo; or he<br>\
straitened him. See, again, رِجْلٌ; and a verse<br>\
there cited as an ex.]<br>\
-A2-  الغُرَابَانِ signifies The<br>\
two lower extremities of the two hips, or haunches,<br>\
that are next to the upper parts of the thighs:<br>\

lower than what is called the فَرَاشَة [or, app.,<br>\
فَرَاش, q. v.]: (K, TA:) or, in a horse and in a<br>\
camel, the two extremities of the haunches, namely,<br>\
their two edges, on the left and right, that are<br>\
above the tail, at the junction of the head of the<br>\
haunch, (As, S, TA,) where the upper parts of<br>\
the haunch, on the right and left, meet: (TA:)<br>\
or the two extremities of the haunch that are<br>\
behind the قَطَاة [or fore part of the croup]:<br>\
(IAar, TA:) pl. غِرْبَانٌ: Dhu-r-Rummeh says,<br>\
referring to camels,<br>\
تَقَوَّبَ عَنْ غِرْبَانِ أَوْرَاكِهَا الخَطْرُ<br>\
meaning تَقَوَّبَتْ غِرْبَانُهَا عَنِ الخَطْرِ [The prominences of their haunches were excoriated from<br>\
the lashing with the tails], the phrase being inverted, for the meaning is known; (S in this<br>\
art.;) or تَقَوَّبَ may be for قَوَّبَ [i. e. the saying<br>\
means the lashing with the tails excoriated the<br>\
prominences of the haunches]: (S in art. خطر:)<br>\
or غِرْبَانٌ signifies the haunches themselves, of<br>\
camels: and is employed [by a synecdoche] to<br>\
signify camels [themselves]: (IAar, TA:) and<br>\
[the sing.] غُرَابٌ is also expl. as meaning the<br>\
extremity of the haunch that is next the back. (L,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  غُرَابٌ signifies also The whole of the<br>\
back of the head. (K, TA.) You say, شَابَ غُرَابُهُ<br>\
The hair of the whole of the back of his head<br>\
became white, or hoary. (TA. [See a similar<br>\
phrase above in this paragraph.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also<br>\
غُرْبٌ, former half, in two places.<br>\
-A3-  And A bunch<br>\
of بَرِير [or fruit of the أَرَاك, q. v.]: (K:) or a<br>\
black bunch thereof: pl. غِرْبَانٌ: (TA:) or غِرْبَانُ<br>\
البَرِيرِ signifies the ripe fruit of the أَرَاك. (S.)<br>\
-A4-<br>\
And Hail, and snow, (K, TA,) and hoar-frost:<br>\
from مُغْرَبٌ signifying the “ dawn; ” because of<br>\
their whiteness. (TA.)<br>\
غُرُوبٌ pl. of غَرْبٌ [q. v.]. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Golius assigns to<br>\
it the meaning of وِهَادٌ, which he renders “ Depressiores terræ; ” as on the authority of J: but I do<br>\
not find this in the S.]<br>\
غَرِيبٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ غُرُبٌ (S, K) and<br>\
↓ غَرِيبِىٌّ (AA, TA) signify the same, (S, K, TA,)<br>\

from his home, or native country; (Msb;) a man<br>\
not of one&#39;s own people: (TA:) a man not of one&#39;s<br>\
own kindred; an alien with respect to kindred;<br>\
(S in explanation of the first;) pl. of the first<br>\
غُرَبَآءُ; (S, TA;) and غُرْبٌ [also] is a pl. of غَرِيبٌ,<br>\
like as قُرْبٌ is of قَرِيبٌ: (TA in art. زلف:) fem.<br>\
of the first غَرِيبَةٌ; pl. غَرَائِبُ. (L, TA.) أَذَاعَتْ<br>\
غَزْلَهَا فِى الغَرَائِبِ, a phrase used by a poet, means<br>\
She distributed her thread among the strange<br>\
women: for most of the women who spin for hire<br>\
are strangers. (L, TA.) And one says وَجْهٌ<br>\
كَمِرْآةِ الغَرِيبَةِ [A face like the mirror of her who<br>\
is a stranger]: because, the غَرِيبَة being among<br>\
such as are not her own people, her mirror is<br>\
always polished; for she has none to give her a<br>\
sincere opinion respecting her face. (A.) And<br>\
لَأَضْرِبَنَّكُمْ ضَرْبَ غَرِيبَةِ الإِبِلِ (tropical:)  [I will assuredly beat<br>\
you with the beating of the strange one of the<br>\
camels] is a saying of El-Hajjáj threatening the<br>\
subjects of his government; meaning, as a strange<br>\
camel, intruding among others when they come<br>\
to water, is beaten and driven away. (IAth,<br>\
TA.) And [hence] قِدْحٌ غَرِيبٌ means (assumed tropical:)  [An<br>\
arrow, without feathers or head,] such as is not<br>\
of the same trees whereof are the rest of the<br>\
arrows. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  غَرِيبٌ signifies also Language<br>\
that is strange; [unusual, extraordinary, or unfamiliar;] far from being intelligible; difficult<br>\
to be understood; or obscure. (Msb, TA.) Hence,<br>\
مُصَنَّفُ الغَرِيبِ [The composition on the subject of<br>\
the strange kind of words &amp;c.]. (A, TA.) [Hence<br>\
also الغَرِيبَانِ The two classes of strange words &amp;c.,<br>\
namely, those occurring in the Kur-án, and those<br>\
of the Traditions.] And كَلِمَةٌ غَرِيبَةٌ A word, or<br>\
an expression, that is [strange, &amp;c., or] obscure:<br>\
(A, TA:) غَرِيبَةٌ applied to a word [and often<br>\
used as an epithet in which the quality of a subst.<br>\
is predominant] is opposed to فَصِيحَةٌ: and its pl.<br>\
is غَرَائِبُ. (Mz 13th نوع.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence it often<br>\
signifies Improbable.] ―<br>\
-b4-  Applied to a trad., it<br>\
means Traced up uninterruptedly to the Apostle<br>\
of God, but related by only one person. of the<br>\
تَابِعُونَ or of those termed أَتْبَاعُ التَّابِعِينَ or of<br>\
those termed أَتْبَاعُ أَتْبَاعِ التَّابِعِينَ. (KT.)<br>\
-A2-  [The<br>\
fem.] غَرِيبَةٌ, in a verse of Aboo-Kebeer El-Hudhalee, as some relate it, is expl. by Skr as meaning Black; syn. سَوْدَآءُ. (TA voce عَزِيزَةُ [q. v.<br>\
It is perhaps used by poetic license for غِرْبِيبَةٌ,<br>\
fem. of غِرْبِيبٌ.])<br>\
غَرِيبَةٌ fem. of غَرِيبٌ [q. v.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, as a<br>\
subst.,] الغَرِيبَةُ signifies (tropical:)  The hand-mill: so called<br>\
because the neighbours borrow it, (A, K, TA.)<br>\
and thus it does not remain with its owners.<br>\
(A, TA.)<br>\
غُرَابِىٌّ A sort of dates. (AHn, K, TA. [See<br>\
also غَرْبِىٌّ.]) In some copies of the K, for تمر is<br>\
put ثمر: the former is the right. (TA.)<br>\
غَرِيبِىٌّ: see غَرِيبٌ.<br>\
غَارِبٌ [The western side of a mountain &amp;c.].<br>\
You say, هٰذَا غَارِبُ الجَبَلِ and ↓ غَرْبِيُّهُ [This is<br>\
the western side of the mountain], and [in the<br>\
opposite sense] هذا شَارِقُ الجَبَلِ and شَرْقِيُّهُ. (TA<br>\
in art. شرق.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The كَاهِل [or withers],<br>\
(A, K, TA,) of the camel; (TA;) or the part<br>\
between the hump and the neck; (S, A, Msb, K,<br>\
TA;) upon which the leading-rope is thrown when<br>\
the camel is sent to pasture where he will: (Msb:)<br>\
pl. غَوَارِبُ. (Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the saying, (S,<br>\
&amp;c.,) حَبْلُكِ عَلَى غَارِبِكِ [Thy rope is upon thy<br>\
withers]; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) used (Msb,<br>\
TA) by the Arabs in the Time of Ignorance (TA)<br>\
in divorcing; (Msb, TA;) meaning (tropical:)  I have left<br>\
thy way free, or open, to thee; (TA;) go whithersoever thou wilt: (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, TA:)<br>\
originating from the fact of throwing a she-camel&#39;s leading-rope upon her withers, if it is<br>\
upon her, when she pastures; for when she sees<br>\
the leading-rope, nothing is productive of enjoyment to her. (As, S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  الغَارِبَانِ signifies<br>\
The fore and kind parts of the back [and of the<br>\
hump]: and بَعِيرٌ ذُو غَارِبَيْنِ, A camel whereof the<br>\
part between the غاربان [or fore and kind parts]<br>\
of the hump is cleft; which is mostly the case in<br>\
the بَخَاتِىّ, whose sire is the فَالِج [or large twohumped camel of Es-Sind] and his dam Arabian.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And غَارِبٌ signifies also The fore part<br>\
of the hump: thus in the following saying, in a<br>\
trad. of Ez-Zubeyr: فَمَا زَالَ يَفْتِلُ فِى الذِّرْوَةِ وَالغَارِبِ<br>\
حَتَّى أَجَابَتْهُ عَائِشَةُ إِلَى الخُرُوجِ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [And he<br>\
ceased not to twist the fur of] the upper part and<br>\
the fore part of the hump [until &#39;Áïsheh gave him<br>\
her consent to go forth]; meaning, he ceased not<br>\
to practise guile with her, and to wheedle her,<br>\
until she gave hun her consent: originating from<br>\
the fact that, when a man desires to render a<br>\
refractory camel tractable, and to attach to him<br>\
the nose-rein, he passes his hand over him, and<br>\
strokes his غارب, and twists its fur, until he has<br>\
become familiar: (L, TA:) or غَارِبٌ signifies the<br>\
upper portion of the fore part of the hump.<br>\
