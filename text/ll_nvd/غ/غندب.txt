الغُنْدُبَةُ A hard portion of flesh [app. a gland]<br>\
around [or app. on either side of] the حُلْقُوم<br>\
[which seems to mean here, as it often does, the<br>\
حَلْق, i. e. fauces, or upper part of the throat];<br>\
(O, K;) thus expl. by Lth; as also ↓ الغُنْدُبُ;<br>\
(O;) or ↓ الغُنْدُوبُ: (K:) pl. غَنَادِبُ: and it is<br>\
said that the غُنْدُبَتَانِ are [two things] like two<br>\
ganglions (شِبْهُ غُدَّتَيْنِ) in the نَكْفَتَانِ; (O, K;) in<br>\
each نَكْفَة [q. v.] is a غُنْدُبَة, and between the غندبتان<br>\
is the place of swallowing: (O:) the غَنَادِب and<br>\
the flesh that is upon them, or above them, around<br>\
the لَهَاة [app. here meaning the arches, or pillars,<br>\
of the soft palate, or the furthest part of the<br>\
mouth], compose the لَغَانِين [pl. of لُغْنُونٌ, q. v.],<br>\
which are also called the نَغَانِغ, pl. of نُغْنُغَةٌ [or<br>\
نُغْنُغٌ, q. v.]: (TA:) or the غندبتان are two<br>\
glands (عُقْدَتَانِ) in, or at, (فِى,) the root of the<br>\
tongue: (K, TA:) and they are said to be the<br>\
two amygdalæ of the fauces; i. e. the tonsils:<br>\
(اللَّوْزَتَانِ: TA:) or two portions of flesh which<br>\
are situate on either side of the لَهَاة [app. meaning<br>\
as expl. above, i. e. the arches, or pillars, of the<br>\
soft palate, or the furthest part of the mouth],<br>\
(K, TA,) and between which is a space: (TA:)<br>\
and غُنْدُبَتَا العُرْشَيْنِ is expl. as meaning the two<br>\
things that conjoin (اللَّتَانِ تَضُمَّانِ) the لَغَانِين<br>\
[above mentioned (I read اللغانين instead of<br>\
العين, an evident mistranscription in my original,<br>\
for I can only suppose the description to mean<br>\
the tonsils, as lodged between, and thus conjoining,<br>\
the anterior and posterior pillars of the soft<br>\
palate,)] on the right and left. (TA.)<br>\
