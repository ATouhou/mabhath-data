غَابَ, (S, O, Mgh, Msb, TA,) aor. يَغِيبُ,<br>\
(Msb,) inf. n. غَيْبَةٌ [the most common form] (S,<br>\
O, Mgh, Msb, K) and غَيْبٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
غَيَابٌ, (S, O,) or غِيَابٌ, (Msb, K,) and غُيُوبٌ (S,<br>\
O, Msb, K) and غُيُوبَةٌ (O, K) and غَيْبُوبَةٌ, (O,<br>\
K,) accord. to some of the measure فَعْلُولَةٌ, but<br>\
accord. to others of the measure فَيْعَلُولَةٌ i. e. originally غَيَّبُوبَةٌ, (MF,) and مَغِيبٌ (S, O, Msb, K)<br>\
and مَغَابٌ; (K;) and ↓ تغيّب; (Msb, K;) He,<br>\
or it, was, or became, absent; غَابَ being the contr.<br>\
of حَضَرَ; (S and K in art. حضر;) or distant, or<br>\
remote; (Mgh;) or hidden, concealed, or unapparent; (TA;) [or absent from the range, or<br>\
beyond the reach, of perception by sense, or of<br>\
mental perception: see غَيْبٌ.] You say, غاب عَنْهُ,<br>\
inf. n. غَيْبَةٌ (S, Mgh, TA) &amp;c., as above, (S, TA,)<br>\
He, or it, was, or became, [absent from him; or]<br>\
distant, or remote, from him; (Mgh;) or hidden,<br>\
or concealed, from him; [&amp;c.;] as also ↓ تغيّب.<br>\
(TA.) And أَوْحَشَتْنِى غَيْبَةُ فُلَانٍ [The absence of<br>\
such a one has made me to feel lonely]: and أَطَلْتَ<br>\
غَيْبَتَكَ [Thou hast made thine absence to be long].<br>\
(A.) And ↓ أَنَا مَعَكُمْ لَا أُغَايِبُكُمْ [I am with you:<br>\
I will not be absent from you]. (A.) And بَنُو<br>\
أَحْيَانًا ↓ فُلَانٍ يَشْهَدُونَ أَحْيَانًا وَيَتَغَايَبُونَ (ISk, S,<br>\
TA) i. e. [The sons of such a one are present sometimes] and are absent (يَغِيبُونَ) sometimes: but<br>\
one does not say ↓ يَتَغَيَّبُونَ [unless with عَنْ following it]: (TA:) [it seems, however, that<br>\
يتغيّبون, here, is a mistranscription for يَتَغَيَّبُونَنَا<br>\
or the like; for] one says, عَنِّى فُلَانٌ ↓ تغيّب<br>\
[Such a one was, or became, absent from me; or<br>\
absented himself from me]; (S, K, * TA;) and<br>\
↓ تَغَيَّبَنِى also in a case of necessity in verse, (S,<br>\
K, TA,) but not in any other case, (K, TA,)<br>\
accord. to the generality of authorities except the<br>\
Koofees: (TA:) Imra-el-Keys says,<br>\
فَظَلَّ لَنَا يَوْمٌ لَذِيذٌ بِنَعْمَةٍ<br>\
فَقُلْ فِى مَقِيلٍ نَحْسُهُ مُتَغَيِّبِى<br>\
[thus in my copies of the S and in the TA; but<br>\
we should read مُتَغَيِّبِ, whether it mean مُتَغَيِّبِى<br>\
or not, as is shown by what follows: the verse<br>\
may be rendered, So a delightful day, with ease<br>\
and comfort, betided us: and say thou, of a place<br>\
of midday-sleep whereof the ill luck was absent<br>\
from me,. . .]: but Fr says that the word<br>\
متغيّب is marfooa, [i. e. that the right reading is<br>\
مُتَغَيِّبُ, meaning simply absent,] that the verse is<br>\
مُكْفَأ [or made faulty in the termination], and that<br>\
it is not allowable to make that word refer to<br>\
مَقِيلٍ, like as it is not allowable to say مَرَرْتُ<br>\
بِرَجُلٍ أَبُوهُ قَائِمٍ. (S, TA. [One might be tempted<br>\
to suppose that we should read فَقِلْ; but this<br>\
would not suit the context, which see in Ahlwardt&#39;s “ Divans of the six ancient Arabic poets,”<br>\
p. 119.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [غاب, inf. n. غَيْبَةٌ, is also said of the<br>\
mind (القَلْب), meaning (assumed tropical:)  It was, or became,<br>\
absent. The inf. n. (غَيْبَةٌ) is often used as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Absence of mind; and particularly, from<br>\
self and others by its being exclusively occupied by<br>\
the contemplation of divine things: see an ex. voce<br>\
شَوًى; and another voce سَكِينَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  مَا غَابَ عَنْهُ<br>\
ابْنُ أَبِى قُحَافَةَ (assumed tropical:)  [Ibn-Abee-Koháfeh was not a<br>\
stranger to it, i. e. was not unacquainted with it,]<br>\
occurs in a trad. respecting a satirical saying of<br>\
Hassán against [the tribe of] Kureysh; meaning<br>\
that Aboo-Bekr [the son of Aboo-Koháfeh] was<br>\
skilled in genealogies and traditions, and that it<br>\
was he who instructed Hassán. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
one says also, غاب الرَّجُلُ, inf. n. غَيْبٌ and مَغِيبٌ;<br>\
and ↓ تغيّب; The man journeyed; and went<br>\
away, or far away. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And غابت الشَّمْسُ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) inf. n. غِيَابٌ and غَيْبُوبَةٌ<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, TA) and غَيْبَةٌ (Mgh) and غُيُوبٌ and<br>\
غُيُوبَةٌ and مَغِيبٌ; (TA;) and ↓ تغيّبت; (Msb;)<br>\
The sun set: (S, Msb, TA:) and the like is also<br>\
said of the moon, (Msb,) and of other celestial<br>\
bodies. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And غاب الشَّىْءُ فِى الشَّىْءِ,<br>\
inf. n. غِيَابَةٌ and غُيُوبَةٌ and غِيَابٌ and غَيَابٌ and<br>\
غِيبَةٌ, [The thing became hidden, or concealed, in<br>\
the thing.] (K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 8, in two places.<br>\
2<br>\
غيّبهُ (S, Msb, TA) He caused him, or it, to<br>\
become absent, or to disappear; or he hid, or concealed, it, عَنْهُ from him. (TA.) See also غَيَابٌ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And see 8.<br>\
3<br>\
مُغَايَبَةٌ signifies The being absent, &amp;c., one<br>\
from the other. (KL.) See also 1, former half.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also The addressing words to another [in his<br>\
absence,] not in his presence, not face to face;<br>\
(KL;) contr. of مُخَاطَبَةٌ. (S, TA.) [You say,<br>\
اغابت, inf. n. as above, He held a verbal communication with him in his absence, i. e. by means of a<br>\
letter or letters, or by a messenger or messengers.]<br>\
4<br>\
اغابت She (a woman) had her husband, (S,<br>\
Msb, TA,) or one of her family, (TA,) absent<br>\
from her. (S, Msb, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَغَيَّبَ see 1, in seven places. ―<br>\
-b2-  The inf. n. تَغَيُّبٌ<br>\
occurring in a trad. respecting the contract for the<br>\
sale of a slave means The selling a stray slave, or<br>\
one who has been found and whose owner is not<br>\
known. (L, TA.)<br>\

8<br>\
اغتابهُ [He spoke evil of him; or did so in<br>\
his absence, i. e. backbit him; (the latter being<br>\
obviously the primary signification;) not always,<br>\
though generally, meaning with truth:] he spoke<br>\
evil of him in his absence; (TA;) or said of him,<br>\
in his absence, what would grieve him (S, TA) if<br>\
he heard it; (S;) with truth: (S, TA:) he carped<br>\
at him behind the back, or in absence, by saying<br>\
what would grieve him, (بِمَا ↓ تَنَاوَلَهُ بِظَهْرِ الغَيْبِ<br>\
يَسُوؤُهُ,) of what was [reprehensible] in him: (TA:)<br>\
or he spoke of him imputing to him what he disliked, of vices, or faults, with truth: (Msb:)<br>\
when the charge is false, it is termed بُهْتَانٌ: (S,<br>\
Msb, TA:) or he attributed, or imputed, to him<br>\
a vice, or fault, or the like; and mentioned him<br>\
with what was in him of evil; (K, TA;) or said<br>\
of him what would grieve him: (TA:) and ↓ غَابَهُ<br>\
signifies the same: (K, TA:) [so does ↓ غيّبهُ:<br>\
(see Ksh in civ. 1:) that اغتابهُ does not always<br>\
signify he spoke evil of him, or the like, in his<br>\
absence, appears from several instances, such as<br>\
the phrases المُغْتَابُ فِى الوَجْهِ (K in art. لمز) and<br>\
المُغْتَابُونَ بِالحَضْرَةِ (IAar, TA in that art.): nor<br>\
does it always signify he spoke evil of him, or the<br>\
like, with truth; for the verb is used in the Ksh<br>\
and by Bd and Jel in civ. 1 having for its object<br>\
the Prophet:] IAar says that ↓ غاب is syn. with<br>\
اغتاب, and signifies he mentioned a man with the<br>\
imputation of good or of evil. (TA.) [It may<br>\
also mean He expressed, or signified, an evil<br>\
opinion of him by making signs with the side of<br>\
the mouth, or with the eye, or with the head, or<br>\
otherwise; as is indicated in the TA in arts. لمز<br>\
and همز.]<br>\
غَابٌ: see غَابَةٌ, in three places.<br>\
غَيْبٌ Whatever is absent, or hidden, from one;<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K, TA;) as though it were an inf. n.<br>\
used in the sense of the act. part. n. [in which the<br>\
meaning of a subst. is predominant]; (TA;) and<br>\
so ↓ غَائِبٌ, which [in this sense] is a subst., like<br>\
كَاهِلٌ, (K, TA,) or an act. part. n. used in the<br>\
sense of a subst.: (MF:) anything that is absent,<br>\
or hidden, from the eyes; invisible, unseen, or unapparent; whether it be, or be not, perceived in<br>\
the heart, or mind: (IAar, TA:) [or anything<br>\
unperceivable; absent from the range, or beyond<br>\
the reach, of perception by sense, or of mental<br>\
perception; or undiscoverable unless by means of<br>\
divine revelation; a mystery, or secret, such as an<br>\
event of futurity;] a thing that has been hidden<br>\
from men, and with which the Prophet has<br>\
acquainted them, of the events of the resurrection<br>\
and of Paradise and of Hell &amp;c.; thus in the<br>\
Kur ii. 2; (Zj, TA;) and [hence] Zj explains<br>\
الغَيْب as meaning, in the Kur lxxxi. 24, that<br>\
which has been revealed: (TA in art. ضن:) pl.<br>\
غُيُوبٌ. (Msb.) [See also the Ksh and Bd in ii. 2.]<br>\
[Hence, عَالَمُ الغَيْبِ The world of the unseen; the<br>\
invisible world.] And [hence also] one says, رَجَمَ<br>\
بِالغَيْبِ [and قَذَفَ بِالغَيْبِ (see art. قذف)] He<br>\
spoke of that which he did not know: (Ham<br>\
p. 494:) and قَالَ رَجْمًا بِالغَيْبِ He said conjecturally, [or speaking of that which was hidden<br>\
from him or unknown by him,] without evidence,<br>\
and without proof. (Msb in art. رجم, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And (assumed tropical:)  Doubt, or a doubting: (K:) but some disapprove this: some regard it as tropical: and<br>\
some pronounce it correct: (MF, TA:) pl. غِيَابٌ<br>\
and غُيُوبٌ. (K.) A poet says,<br>\
أَنْتَ نَبِىٌّ تَعْلَمُ الغِيَابَا<br>\
لَا قَائِلًا إِفْكًا وَلَا مُرْتَابَا<br>\
[Thou art a prophet, knowing doubts, or things<br>\
doubted; not saying a lie, nor a thing suspected:<br>\
or, more probably, the meaning is, the things<br>\
unseen]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A place, in the ground,<br>\
that hides, or conceals, one: (TA:) a low, or<br>\
depressed, place in the ground, or in a tract of<br>\
land: (S, K, TA:) or any place such that one<br>\
knows not what is in it: and a place such that one<br>\
knows not what is behind it: (Sh, TA:) pl. غُيُوبٌ.<br>\
(TA.) Hence the phrase عَنْ ظَهْرِ غَيْبٍ in a verse<br>\
of Lebeed cited voce ظَهْرٌ, q. v. (TA.) [Hence<br>\
also] one says, سَمِعْتُ صَوْتًا مِنْ وَرَآءِ الغَيْبِ i. e.<br>\
[I heard a sound, or voice,] from [behind] a<br>\
place that I saw not. (A, TA.) And تَنَاوَلَهُ<br>\
بِظَهْرِ الغَيْبِ بِمَا يَسُوؤُهُ: see 8. And تَكَلَّمَ بِهِ عَنْ<br>\
ظَهْرِ غَيْبٍ (A) or عَنْ ظَهْرِ الغَيْبِ (TA, and A and<br>\
O in art. ظهر) [app. He spoke of it by memory;<br>\
in the absence of a book or the like; as one says<br>\
in modern Arabic, عَلَى الغَائِب. See also ظَهْرٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Also The خَمْصَة [i. e. pit, or depression, as is<br>\
shown by what here follows, (thus in the A, and<br>\
in the Ksh in ii. 2, in the TA حُفْرَة, which has a<br>\
similar meaning,)] that is in the place where the<br>\
kidney is situate, (Ksh, A, TA,) and which swells<br>\
up when the beast becomes big in the belly: so says<br>\
ISh: (Ksh ubi suprà:) or the خَمْصَة that is next<br>\
to the kidney: (Bd in ii. 2: [De Sacy doubted<br>\
respecting its meaning, but conjectured that it<br>\
might be thus: see his Anthol. Gramm. Arabe<br>\
p. 55:]) pl. غُيُوبٌ: one says, شَرِبَتِ الدَّابَّةُ حَتَّى<br>\
وَارَتْ غُيُوبَ كُلَاهَا, (ISh, Ksh ubi suprà, A, TA,)<br>\
meaning هُزُومَهَا [i. e. The beast drank until it concealed the pits of its kidneys]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
Fat: (K, TA:) i. e. the fat of the ثَرْب [q. v.] of<br>\
a sheep or goat: so called because it is hidden<br>\
from the eye. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also غَائِبٌ.<br>\
غَيَبٌ: see غَائِبٌ, in two places.<br>\
غَابَةٌ is originally [غَيَبَةٌ] of the measure فَعَلَةٌ,<br>\
with fet-h to the ع. (Msb.) It signifies A low,<br>\
or depressed, place, or a hollow in the ground,<br>\
(El-Hawázinee, K, TA,) before which, or in the<br>\
way to which, (دُونَهَا,) is an eminence. (El-Hawá-<br>\
zinee, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (K) i. q. أَجَمَةٌ: (S, K, TA:)<br>\
[i. e.] A bed of canes or reeds: (AHn, Msb, TA:)<br>\
and [a thicket, wood, or forest; like أَجَمَةٌ;] a<br>\
collection of trees, (AHn, ISd, TA,) densely disposed; so called because it conceals what is in it:<br>\
(ISd, TA:) or a tall أَجَمَة, having high, or very<br>\
high, extremities [app. to its canes or reeds]:<br>\
(TA:) pl. غَابَاتٌ (Msb, TA) and [coll. gen. n.]<br>\
↓ غَابٌ. (S, Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  A long spear<br>\
(K, TA) that has extremities like those of the أَجَمَة<br>\
[expl. above]: (TA:) [but I think that this addition in the TA correctly applies to غَابَةٌ signifying<br>\
a number of spears, like a bed of canes or reeds, or<br>\
like a forest; agreeably with two of the explanations here following:] or a spear that quivers in<br>\
the wind: (K, TA:) or (tropical:)  numerous spears, like<br>\
abundant and dense trees: (A:) or an assemblage<br>\
of spears; app. so called as being likened to a<br>\
غابة meaning an أَجَمَة of dense trees: (ISd, TA:)<br>\
pl. غَابَات and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ غَابٌ. (TA.) One<br>\
says, أَتَوْنَا فِى غَابَةٍ i. e. (tropical:)  [They came to us] amid<br>\
numerous spears, like abundant and dense trees:<br>\
(A:) or غابة may be used in this case in the<br>\
sense here following. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A company,<br>\
or congregated body, of men: (Aboo-Jábir ElAsadee, K, TA:) pl. غَابَاتٌ and [coll. gen. n.]<br>\
↓ غَابٌ. (TA.)<br>\
غَيْبَةٌ an inf. n. [See 1, in several places.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, and ↓ غَيَابَةٌ, A low, or depressed, piece of<br>\
land or ground: so in the phrases وَقَعْنَا فِى غَيْبَةٍ<br>\
and غَيَابَةٍ [app. meaning We lighted upon a low,<br>\
or depressed, piece &amp;c.; or perhaps the meaning<br>\
may be we fell into &amp;c.]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also غَيَابَةٌ.<br>\
غِيبَةٌ the subst. from اِغْتَابَهُ: (Msb:) it signifies<br>\
[Evil speech respecting a person; or such speech<br>\
in his absence; not always, though generally,<br>\
meaning with truth:] evil speech respecting a<br>\
person in his absence; (TA;) or a saying of him,<br>\
in his absence, what would grieve him (S, TA) if<br>\
he heard it; (S;) with truth: (S, TA:) or speech<br>\
respecting a person imputing to him what he dislikes, of vices, or faults, with truth: (Msb:) when<br>\
it is false, it is termed بُهْتَانٌ: (S, Msb, TA:) or<br>\
an imputing to a person a vice, or fault, or the<br>\
like; and a mentioning him with what is in him<br>\
of evil; (K, TA;) or a saying of him what<br>\
would grieve him: (TA:) or it may be speech<br>\
imputing good or evil. (K, * TA.)<br>\
غَيِبَانٌ or غَيْبَانٌ, [accord. to different copies of<br>\
the K, between which the TA does not enable us<br>\
to decide with certainty, as it only states, with<br>\
respect to the ى, that it is مُخَفَّفَة, which may<br>\
mean either the contr. of doubled or the contr. of<br>\
movent, though the former is the more general<br>\
meaning, (in the TA it is said to be erroneously<br>\
written in a copy of the K with a final ت instead<br>\
of ن,)] and ↓ غَيِّبَانٌ, The roots of trees, (K, TA,)<br>\
that are hidden from view: or, accord. to AHn,<br>\
the غيبان and ↓ غيّبان and ↓ غَيَابَة, of plants, or<br>\
herbage, are, with the Arabs, what the sun has<br>\
not shone upon: and accord. to Aboo-Ziyád ElKilábee, the غيبان and ↓ غيّبان of plants, or<br>\
herbage, and also of their roots, are what is con-<br>\
cealed from the sun, so as to be not shone upon by<br>\
it. (L, TA.)<br>\
غَيِّبَانٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
غَيَابٌ A thing that hides, or conceals, a thing<br>\
from one: (Meyd:) and hence, (Meyd, TA,) a<br>\
grave; (S, Meyd, TA;) and so ↓ غَيَابَةٌ: (TA:)<br>\
one says, غَيَابُهُ ↓ غَيَّبَهُ (S, Meyd, TA) and ↓ غَيَابَتُهُ<br>\
(TA) meaning دُفِنَ فِى قَبْرِهِ (S, Meyd, TA) [i. e.<br>\
May he be buried in his grave]: an imprecation<br>\
of death against the man. (Meyd.)<br>\
غَيَابَةٌ The part of anything that veils, or conceals, one. (K.) And hence, (K,) The bottom of<br>\
a جُبّ [or well]; (S, K, * TA;) or this, accord.<br>\
to some, is the primary signification; as also<br>\
↓ غَيْبَةٌ, accord. to one reading, in the Kur xii. 10;<br>\
(TA;) [and غَيَايَةٌ;] and of a valley; (S, TA;)<br>\
&amp;c.: (TA:) pl. غَيَابَاتٌ. (K, TA.) [And A covert,<br>\
or place of concealment, of birds. (See ظِلَالَةٌ.)]<br>\
See also غَيَابٌ, in two places: and غَيْبَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
see غَيِبَانٌ.<br>\
غَائِبٌ act. part. n. of 1 [signifying Absent; distant, or remote; and hidden, concealed, or unapparent; or absent from the range, or beyond<br>\
the reach, of perception by sense, or of mental<br>\
perception]: pl. (applied to men, K, TA) غُيَّبٌ<br>\
and غُيَّابٌ (S, Msb, K) and غَائِبُونَ (K) and<br>\
↓ غَيَبٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) or rather the last is a<br>\
quasi-pl. n., (TA,) and ↓ غَيْبٌ, [which is also<br>\
properly speaking a quasi-pl. n.,] like صَحْبٌ:<br>\
(Msb [in which غَيَبٌ is not mentioned]:) the ى<br>\
in ↓ غَيَبٌ remains unchanged, notwithstanding the<br>\
two fet-hahs, because it is likened to صَيَدٌ, and,<br>\
although it is a pl. [in signification] and صَيَدٌ is<br>\
an inf. n., it may be used as meant for an inf. n.<br>\
(S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also غَيْبٌ, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
A run in which a horse reserves [somewhat of his<br>\
force for the time of need]. (A in art. شهد: see<br>\

of time, signifying] The place [and the time] of<br>\
setting of the sun and of the moon [&amp;c.]. (Msb.)<br>\
مُغِيبٌ and مُغِيبَةٌ, (Mgh, Msb, K,) or you say<br>\
مُغِيبَةٌ [only], with ة, and [in the contr. sense]<br>\
مُشْهِدٌ, without ة, (IDrd, S,) and مُغْيِبٌ (K) and<br>\
