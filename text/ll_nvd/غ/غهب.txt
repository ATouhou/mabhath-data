pronounced with kesr, (K,) is a simple subst.;<br>\
(Msb;) He erred; deviated from the right way<br>\
or course, or from that which was right: (S,<br>\

and persisted, (IAth, Msb, TA,) in that which<br>\
was vain, or false, (IAth, TA,) or in ignorant<br>\

drank the milk until he suffered indigestion; and<br>\

suffered indigestion: (TA:) or, accord. to ISk,<br>\
(S, TA,) he did not satisfy his thirst with the<br>\
biestings of his mother, (S,) or he did not drink<br>\

or he (a kid, AZ, TA) was withheld from sucking<br>\
(AZ, K, TA) until hunger injured him (AZ, TA)<br>\
so that he became emaciated, (AZ, K, TA,) and<br>\

(T, TA:) or, said of a child, and of a young<br>\
camel, he found not a sufficiency of milk, so that<br>\

Sh says that his companions held this to be the<br>\
correct meaning: (TA:) the epithet applied to<br>\
the young camel [&amp;c.] is ↓ غَوٍ. (K.) Z has mentioned the reading in the Kur [xx. 119], وَعَصَى<br>\
آدَمُ رَبَّهُ فَغَوِىَ, expl. as meaning [And Adam disobeyed his Lord, and] suffered indigestion from<br>\
much eating: but better than this is what Az<br>\
and Er-Rághib say; that it is فَغَوَى; and that<br>\
the meaning is, and his life became evil to him;<br>\
or he was disappointed; or he acted ignorantly;<br>\
or some other of the meanings mentioned by the<br>\
expositors. (TA.)<br>\

4<br>\
اغواهُ; (S, MA, Msb, K;) and ↓ غوّاهُ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. تَغْوِيَةٌ; (TA;) and ↓ غَوَاهُ, (K, TA,) mentioned by El-Muärrij; (TA;) [but] accord. to As,<br>\
one should not say otherwise than اغواهُ; (S, TA;)<br>\
He caused him to err; or to deviate from the<br>\
right course, or from that which was right: (S,<br>\
Msb, K:) and caused him to be disappointed; or<br>\
to fail of attaining his desire: (S:) or he seduced<br>\
him, misled him, or led him astray; as also<br>\

says,<br>\
وَكَائِنْ تَرَى مِنْ جَاهِلٍ بَعْدَ عِلْمِهِ<br>\
↓ الهَوَى جَهْلًا عَنِ الحَقِّ فَانْغَوَى ↓ غَوَاهُ<br>\
[How many an ignorant dost thou see, whom,<br>\
after his knowledge, love, or desire, has urged to<br>\
turn, in ignorance, from that which was right,<br>\
and who has turned: or has turned, in ignorance,<br>\
from that which was right, and who has suffered<br>\
himself to be turned; for,] accord. to Az, غَوَاهُ<br>\
الهَوَى is most correctly rendered as meaning لَوَاهُ,<br>\
and صَرَفَهُ; and انغوى is quasi-pass. thereof.<br>\
(TA.) The saying in the Kur [vii. 15], related<br>\
as from Iblees, فَبِمَا أَغْوَيْتَنِى means [Then by, or<br>\
because of,] thy having caused me to err: or, as<br>\
some say, invited me to [do] a thing whereby I<br>\
have erred. (TA.) But the saying in the same<br>\
[xi. 36], إِنْ كَانَ اللّٰهُ يُرِيدُ أَنْ يُغْوِيَكُمْ is said to<br>\
mean If God desire to punish you for erring: or<br>\
to decree, against you, your erring [i. e. that ye<br>\
shall err]. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَغَاوَوْا عَلَيْهِ They collected themselves together,<br>\
or combined, and aided one another, against him;<br>\
(S, TA;) originally, (TA,) in an evil affair; from<br>\
الغَىّ and الغَوَايَة: (S, TA:) or they aided one<br>\
another against him, and slew him; (K;) but<br>\
this addition “ and slew him ” is from a trad.<br>\
respecting the slaying of &#39;Othmán, in which it is<br>\
said, فَتَغَاوَوْا عَلَيْهِ وَاللّٰهِ حَتَّى قَتَلُوهُ [and they collected themselves together, &amp;c., against him, by<br>\
God, so that they slew him]: (TA:) or they<br>\
came against him from this quarter and from<br>\
that; though they did not slay him: (ISd, K,<br>\
TA:) or they collected themselves together, and<br>\
aided one another, against him, as do those who<br>\
err, or deviate from the right way or course;<br>\
thus expl. by Z. (TA.) [See also 6 in arts. غى<br>\
and عو.]<br>\
7<br>\
انغوى signifies اِنْهَوَى and مَالَ [app. He<br>\
declined from the right way or course; for all of<br>\
these three verbs seem to be here used in one and<br>\
the same sense, agreeably with a saying in the<br>\
JK, المُنْغَوِى شِبْهُ المُنْهَوِى المَائِلُ]: (K:) [or<br>\
rather,] accord. to Az, [it signifies he was, or<br>\
became, or suffered himself to be, made to decline,<br>\
or to turn, from the right way or course, by love,<br>\
or desire; for he says that] it is quasi-pass. of<br>\
غَوَاهُ الهَوَى, which signifies أَمَالَهُ and صَرَفَهُ: (TA:)<br>\
or he fell into error by yielding to love and desire.<br>\

S, &amp;c.; [see 1, first sentence;]) or the latter is a<br>\
simple subst.: (Msb:) [both, used as substs.,<br>\
signify Error; &amp;c.: ↓ غَيَّةٌ, of which the pl.<br>\
(غَيَّاتٌ) is mentioned by Freytag as meaning<br>\
errors, from the Deewán of the Hudhalees, is an<br>\
inf. n. of un., and signifies an error, &amp;c.:] and<br>\
غَىٌّ signifies also a state of perdition. (Ham p.<br>\
643.) See also غَيَّةٌ. ―<br>\

by God for those who err: it is said that it has<br>\
one or the other of these meanings in the Kur<br>\

because it is the consequence of غَىّ [properly thus<br>\
termed]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or it there means<br>\
evil: or the recompense of غَىّ [i. e. of error]: or<br>\
deviation from the way of Paradise. (Bd.)<br>\
