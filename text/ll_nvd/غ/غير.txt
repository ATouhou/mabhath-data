upon them abundance of the produce of the earth.<br>\

غيّر الشَّىْءَ, (S, Msb, K, *) inf. n. تَغْيِيرٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
He made the thing other than it was; (K;) made<br>\

or changed, the thing in odour, or otherwise, for<br>\
the worse; corrupted, tainted, or infected, it; rendered it ill-smelling, stinking, fetid, rancid, rank,<br>\
fusty, or frouzy. (The lexicons passim.) It is<br>\
said in the Kur [viii. 55], ذٰلِكَ بِأَنَّ اللّٰهَ لَمْ يَكُ مُغَيِّرًا<br>\
نِعْمَةً أَنْعَمَهَا عَلَى قَوْمٍ حَتَّى يُغَيِّرُوا مَا بِأَنْفُسِهِمْ [This<br>\

-A2-  See also 1, latter half.<br>\

غَيْرٌ signifies i. q. سِوًى [Other]: and the pl. is<br>\
أَغْيَارٌ: (S:) [but غَيْر itself often has a pl. meaning, as will be seen in what follows:] or [accord.<br>\
to general usage, as will be seen below,] غَيْرُ signifies i. q. سِوَى [other than; exclusively of; or<br>\
not, as used before a substantive or an adjective].<br>\
(Msb, K: in the CK [erroneously] سِوًى.) It is<br>\
used to qualify a subst.; [governing (as a prefixed noun) the noun that follows it in the gen.<br>\
case;] and when so used, it is put in the same<br>\
case as the noun preceding it. (S.) It qualifies<br>\
an indeterminate noun: (Mughnee, Msb:) you<br>\
say جَآءَنِى رَجُلٌ غَيْرُكَ [A man, other than, or<br>\
not, thou, came to me]: (Msb:) and نَعْمَلْ صَالِحًا<br>\
غَيْرَ الَّذِى كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ [We will in that case do good,<br>\
other than, or not, what we used to do: (Kur<br>\
xxxv. 34:)]: (Mughnee:) and مِنْ مَآءٍ غَيْرِ آسِنٍ<br>\
[Of water other than, or not, altered in taste and<br>\
colour]. (Kur xlvii. 16.) It is a noun necessarily<br>\
prefixed, as to the sense, to a noun which it<br>\
governs in the gen. case: but sometimes it is<br>\
without the latter, when the meaning is understood and it is preceded by لَيْسَ, (Mughnee, K,)<br>\
or by لَا: (K:) [in which case it signifies Any<br>\
other person or thing; any person or thing beside,<br>\
or else:] you say قَبَضْتُ عَشَرَةً لَيْسَ غَيْرُهَا [I received ten; not other than they was received by<br>\
me; i. e., not any other thing; or not anything<br>\
beside, or else]; (Mughnee, K;) the enunciative,<br>\
مَقْبُوضًا, being suppressed: (Mughnee:) and ليس<br>\
غَيْرَهَا, (Mughnee, K;) the noun [of ليس] being<br>\
understood; i. e., لَيْسَ المَقْبُوضُ غَيْرَهَا: (Mughnee:)<br>\
and ليس غَيْرَ; in which the affixed noun [for<br>\
المضاف, in the K, I read المضاف اليه, as in the<br>\
Mughnee,] is suppressed, and the noun [of ليس]<br>\
is also understood: (Mughnee, K:) and ليس غَيْرُ;<br>\
(Mughnee, K;) in which, accord. to Mbr, and<br>\
the later authors, غير is indecl., being likened to<br>\
قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ, so that it may be either the noun<br>\
or the enunciative [of ليس] or, accord. to Akh,<br>\
it is decl., because it is not a noun of time like<br>\
قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ, nor of place like فَوْقُ and تَحْتُ,<br>\
but like كُلٌّ and بَعْضٌ, so that it is the noun [of<br>\
ليس], and the enunciative is suppressed; (Mughnee;) or it may be either indecl. or decl., (Mughnee, K,) accord. to Ibn-Kharoof: (Mughnee:)<br>\
and ليس غَيْرًا, and ليس غَيْرٌ; (Mughnee, K;) in<br>\
both which cases it is decl., as though the affixed<br>\
noun were mentioned: (Mughnee:) and لَا غَيْرُ;<br>\
for the saying, [which we find in the Mughnee,]<br>\
app. taken from a statement of Seer, that this is<br>\
incorrect, is not good, since it occurs in the following verse, cited by Ibn-Málik;<br>\
جَوَابًا بِهِ تَنْجُو اعْتَمِدْ فَوَرَبِّنَا<br>\
لَعَنْ عَمَلٍ أَسْلَفْتَ لَا غَيْرُ تُسْأَلُ<br>\
[Aim thou at having an answer by which thou<br>\
mayest be safe; for, by our Lord, respecting an<br>\
action which thou shalt have done before, not any<br>\
other thing, or not anything beside or else, thou<br>\
wilt be asked]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It does not become<br>\
determinate by its being prefixed to another<br>\
noun, because it is very vague: but it is also<br>\
applied as an epithet to a determinate noun<br>\
which is near to being indeterminate; as in صِرَاطَ<br>\
الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ [The way<br>\
of those upon whom Thou hast conferred favour;<br>\
the other than, or those who are not, the objects of<br>\
anger; (Kur i. 6 and 7;)] because the noun rendered determinate by the art. ال denoting a genus<br>\
is near to being indeterminate, and because when<br>\
غير occurs between two contraries its vagueness<br>\
becomes weakened, (Mughnee, K, *) or altogether<br>\
departs: (K:) or it is here applied as an epithet<br>\
to a determinate noun because it resembles a determinate noun in its being prefixed to such a<br>\
noun: (Msb:) Az says that غير is here in the<br>\
gen. case because it is an epithet to الذين; and<br>\
that it may be an epithet to [what is technically<br>\
termed in this instance] a determinate noun [as<br>\
having the article ال prefixed to it] because الذين<br>\
has not [in itself] a direct meaning (لِأَنَّ الَّذِينَ<br>\
غَيْرُ مَصْمُودٍ صَمْدُهُ), [it being merely a conjunct<br>\
noun, the meaning of which is determined by<br>\
what follows it,] notwithstanding it has the art.<br>\
ال prefixed to it: Abu-l-&#39;Abbás says that Fr holds<br>\
الذين to have the office of an indeterminate noun;<br>\
and غير to be an epithet of it; not of any other<br>\
noun; but that غير, accord. to some, may be an<br>\
epithet relating to the nouns implied in انعمت<br>\
عليهم, these not having a direct meaning: Akh<br>\
says that غير [with what follows] is a substitute<br>\
[for الذين with what follows], as though the<br>\
meaning were صِرَاطَ غَيْرِ المَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ [the way<br>\
of those who are not the objects of anger]. (TA.)<br>\
The reading غَيْرَ is also related, on the authority<br>\
of Ibn-Ketheer, in the accus. case, as a denotative<br>\
of state, [meaning they being not the objects of<br>\
anger,] relating to the pronoun governed in the<br>\
gen. case by the prep. [in عليهم]; or by أَعْنِى [I<br>\
mean] understood; or as an exceptive, [accord.<br>\
to a usage to be explained below,] if the favours<br>\
be interpreted as conferred in common upon the<br>\
two classes of persons. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b3-  As it resembles<br>\
a determinate noun in its being prefixed to a determinate noun, [as المغضوب in the above-cited<br>\
passage of the Kur,] some have presumed to prefix to it the article ال: but against this it may be<br>\
urged, that its prefixion to a determinate noun is<br>\
not to render the expression determinate, but for<br>\
specification; and ال does not imply specification.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  In the following verse of Hassán,<br>\
أَتَانَا فَلَمْ نَعْدِلْ سِوَاهُ بِغَيْرِهِ<br>\
نَبِىٌّ بَدَا فِى ظُلْمَةِ اللَّيْلِ هَادِيَا<br>\
the meaning is, [A prophet came to us, who<br>\
appeared in the darkness of night, a director in<br>\
the right way,] and we did not weigh another<br>\
than him with another than the other, i. e., with<br>\
him. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [وَغَيْرُ ذٰلِكَ is a phrase of<br>\
frequent occurrence, meaning Et cœtera.] ―<br>\
-b6-  غَيْرُ<br>\
is also used in the sense of لَيْسَ [He, or it, is not];<br>\
as in the phrase كَلَامُ اللّٰهِ غَيْرُ مَخْلُوقٍ [The word<br>\
of God is not created], syn. لَيْسَ بِمَخْلُوقٍ. (Az,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  It is also used in the sense of لَا [meaning Not, as used before a participle]; (S, K;)<br>\
and then it is in the accus. case, as a denotative<br>\
of state; (S;) as in the phrase فَمَنِ اضْطُرَّ غَيْرَ بَاغٍ,<br>\
(S, K,) in the Kur [ii. 168, and other places],<br>\
(S,) i. e., جَائِعًا لَا بَاغِيًا [But whosoever is necessitated, being hungry, not transgressing the due<br>\
bounds]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  It is also used as an exceptive, (S, Mughnee,) in the sense of إِلَّا [Except; save; or but]; (Msb, K;) and then it is<br>\
put in the same case in which the word following<br>\
إِلَّا would be put in the same phrase, (S, Mughnee, Msb, K,) because it is originally a qualificative, and its use as an exceptive is adventitious:<br>\
(S:) therefore you say جَآءَ القَوْمُ غَيْرَ زَيْدٍ [The<br>\
people came, except Zeyd]; and مَا جَآءَنِى أَحَدٌ غَيْرَ<br>\
زَيْدٍ and غَيْرُ زَيْدٍ [Not any one came to me, except<br>\
Zeyd]: (Msb, K:) or its case depends upon the<br>\
governing words, so that you say مَا قَامَ غَيْرُ زَيْدٍ<br>\
[No one stood, except Zeyd], and مَا رَأَيْتُ غَيْرَ زَيْدٍ<br>\
[I saw not any, except Zeyd]: (Msb:) but Fr<br>\
says that some of the Benoo-Asad and Kudá&#39;ah<br>\
put غير in the accus. case, when used in the sense<br>\
of إِلَّا, whether the phrase before it be complete or<br>\
incomplete; saying مَا جَآءَنِى غَيْرَكَ [Not any one<br>\
came to me, except thou], and ما جاءنى أَحَدٌ غَيْرَكَ<br>\
[Not any one came to me, except thou]: (S, Msb:)<br>\
and AA says that when غير has the place of إِلَّا,<br>\
it is put in the accus. case. (Msb.) In the saying لَا إِلٰهَ غَيْرُ اللّٰهِ [There is no deity other than<br>\
God], غير is in the nom. case because it is<br>\
the enunciative of لا; but it may be put in the<br>\
accus. case, as meaning إِلَّا. (Msb.) When, as<br>\
an exceptive, it is prefixed to an indecl. word<br>\
[and not preceded by a prep.], it may be itself<br>\
indecl., with fet-h for its termination; as in the<br>\
following verse;<br>\
لَمْ يَمْنَعِ الشُّرْبَ مِنْهَا غَيْرَ أَنْ نَطَقَتْ<br>\
حَمَامَةٌ فِى غُصُونٍ ذَاتِ أَوْقَالِ<br>\
[Nought prevented the drinking from it, except<br>\
that a pigeon cooed, upon branches having اوقال,<br>\
which app. means stumps of cut shoots]. (Mughnee, K.) [See also an ex. (of غَيْرَ أَنَّ) in a verse<br>\
cited voce بَيْدَ.] ―<br>\
-b9-  [It is often used with a prep.;<br>\
as in بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ Without reckoning; (Kur ii. 208,<br>\
&amp;c.;) and مِنْ غَيْرِ سُوْءٍ Without leprosy. (Kur<br>\
xx. 23, &amp;c.)]<br>\
-A2-  غَيْرٌ (JK, K) and (JK) ↓ غِيَرٌ<br>\
(JK, S) signifying The act of altering, or<br>\
changing, i. q. تَغْيِيرٌ, (JK,) are substs. from غَيَّرَهُ;<br>\
(S with respect to the latter, and K with respect<br>\
to the former;) not inf. ns., as having no unaugmented verb. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] الدَّهْرِ ↓ غِيَرُ,<br>\
the former of these two words being of the same<br>\
measure as عِنَب, The accidents, or casualties, of<br>\
time or fortune, which alter, or change, things:<br>\
(K:) [or alteration, or change, of time or of<br>\
fortune; for] IAmb says, with respect to the<br>\
saying لَا أَرَانِى اللّٰهُ بِكَ غِيَرًا [May God not show<br>\
me, in thee, alteration of state], that غِيَرٌ is from<br>\
تَغَيُّرُ الحَالِ, a subst. like قِطَعٌ [as meaning “ a<br>\
portion of the night ”]; or that it may be a pl.,<br>\
of which the sing. is ↓ غِيْرَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence<br>\
also,] بَنَاتُ غَيْرٍ [or ↓ غِيَرٍ, as in Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov. i. 309,] (tropical:)  Lying: or a lie, or falsehood:<br>\
syn. كَذِبٌ: (TS, K:) or [rather] lies. (JK, A.)<br>\
You say جَآءَ بِبَنَاتِ غَيْرٍ [or ↓ غِيَرٍ] (tropical:)  He uttered<br>\
lies. (A.)<br>\

this is a sing., (S, TA,) of the masc. gender;<br>\
TA;) and the pl. is أَغْيَارٌ: (S, TA:) and the دِيَة<br>\
