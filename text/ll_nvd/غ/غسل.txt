(بِالمَآءِ): (MA:) غَسْلُ الشّىْءِ signifies the removing<br>\

thing, by making water to run over it. (Mgh.)<br>\
You say, غَسَلَ الجِلْدَ كُلَّهُ [He washed the skin,<br>\
all of it], and المَيِّتَ [the dead body]: and ↓ غسّل<br>\
has the like, but an intensive, meaning. (Msb.)<br>\
See also 10. ―<br>\
-b2-  وَاغْسِلْنِى بِمَآءِ الثَّلْجِ وَالبَرَدِ [lit. And<br>\
wash Thou me with the water of snow and of hail],<br>\
in a trad. relating to [forms of] prayer, means<br>\

one says, غَسَلَ اللّٰهُ حَوْبَتَكَ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  May God cleanse<br>\
thee from thy sin. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  مَا غَسَلُوا رُؤُوسَهُمْ مِنْ<br>\

wife [before his going to the mosque]; (Mgh, O;)<br>\
and El-Kutabee says that most hold this to be<br>\
the meaning; i. e., lest he should see in his way<br>\
anything that might divert his heart [from devotion]; (Mgh;) [and then washes himself;] and<br>\
Az held غَسَلَ, without teshdeed to be correct<br>\
(Mgh, O) in this sense: (Mgh:) or the meaning<br>\
accord. to the reading of غسّل is, whose performs<br>\
the [ablution termed] وُضُوءْ fully, washing every<br>\
member [of those that are to be washed] three<br>\
times, (Mgh, O,) and then washes himself for the<br>\
[prayers of] Friday; (Mgh;) and accord. to<br>\

and then washes himself for the [prayers of]<br>\
Friday; (O:) accord. to the K, ↓ التَّغْسِيلَ signifies the exceeding the ordinary bounds in washing the members: (TA:) he who explains as<br>\
meaning the causing a woman to become under<br>\
the obligation of performing a total ablution, بِأَنْ<br>\

the authorities respecting it. (Mgh.) ―<br>\

asked to wash, wash ye]: i. e., when he who was<br>\
