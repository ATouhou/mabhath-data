غَفَلَ عَنْهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
غَفُلَ, (S, O,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. غُفُولٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and غَفْلَةٌ, (S,<br>\
O, Msb,) or the latter is a simple subst., (K,) or<br>\
it is a simple subst. as well as an inf. n., and so<br>\
may be غُفْلَانٌ, said in the K to be a simple subst.;<br>\
and MF says that غَفِلَ, aor.<br>\
غَفَلَ, of which غَفَلٌ,<br>\
mentioned in the K as a subst. syn. with<br>\
غَفْلَةٌ, may be the inf. n., has been mentioned<br>\
by some as a dial. var. of غَفَلَ, but had not been<br>\
found by him in any of the lexicological works<br>\
notwithstanding much research, so that its correctness requires consideration; (TA;) He was,<br>\
or became, unmindful, forgetful, neglectful, or<br>\
heedless, of it, or inadvertent to it; (Msb;)<br>\
namely, a thing: (S, O, Msb:) or he neglected<br>\
it; and was, or became, unmindful, forgetful,<br>\
neglectful, or heedless, of it, or inadvertent to it:<br>\
(K:) and sometimes it is used as meaning he<br>\
neglected it [intentionally], leaving it, and turning<br>\
away: (Msb:) and ↓ اغفلهُ signifies the same as<br>\
غَفَلَ عَنْهُ: or غَفَلَ signifies صَارَغَافِلًا [he became<br>\
unmindful, forgetful, neglectful, heedless, or inadvertent]: and غَفَلَ عَنْهُ and ↓ اغفلهُ signify وَصَّلَ<br>\
غَفْلَتَهُ إِلَيْهِ [which is app. said merely for the purpose of showing that the former verb is made<br>\
trans. only by means of عَنْ, and the latter is<br>\
trans. without any prep.; for وَصَّلَ الفِعْلَ إِلَى<br>\
مَفْعُوِلهِ and أَوْصَلَهُ إِلَيْهِ, which latter phrase is the<br>\
more usual, mean “ he made the verb transitive ”]:<br>\
(K:) or ↓ اغفلهُ signifies he neglected it (i. e. a<br>\
thing) though remembering it. (&#39;Eyn, Sb, S, O,<br>\
Msb.) It is said in a trad., مَنِ اتَّبَعَ الصَّيْدَ غَفَلَ<br>\
i. e. He who pursues the object of the chase has<br>\
his mind busied and possessed by it so that he<br>\
becomes unmindful [&amp;c. of other things]. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
غفّلهُ, inf. n. تَغْفِيلٌ, He made him to become<br>\
unmindful, forgetful, neglectful, heedless, or inadvertent. (Msb.) ―<br>\

-b3-  التَّغْفِيلُ<br>\
signifies [also] The sufficing one&#39;s companion [in<br>\
respect of an affair] when he who is the object<br>\
thereof is unmindful, unoccupied [in mind, or<br>\
actually,] by anything. (ISk, K, TA.) [You<br>\
say, غفّل صَاحِبَهُ meaning He sufficed his companion in respect of an affair when he (the latter)<br>\
was unmindful, &amp;c.]<br>\
-A2-  And غفّلهُ, (Mgh, O, K,<br>\
but in my copy of the Mgh written without tesh-deed,) inf. n. as above, (O, K,) He concealed it,<br>\
(Mgh, O, K,) namely, a thing. (Mgh, O.)<br>\
3<br>\
غافلهُ [app. He acted with him in the manner<br>\
of him who is unmindful, forgetful, neglectful,<br>\
heedless, or inadvertent]. (TA voce سَاهَاهُ, q. v.,<br>\
in art. سهو.)<br>\
4<br>\
اغفلهُ: see 1, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
one says, مَا أَغْفَلَهُ عَنْكَ شَيْئًا [app. lit. signifying<br>\
How unmindful of thee is he as to anything! and<br>\
therefore virtually] meaning dismiss doubt [from<br>\
thee respecting him as to anything]. (TA. [See<br>\
further explanations of it voce شَىْءٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
اغفلهُ عَنْهُ He made him to be unmindful, forgetful, neglectful, or heedless, of it, or inadvertent to<br>\
it; (S, * O, TA;) namely, a thing. (S.) [Or]<br>\
اغفلهُ signifies He, or it, smote him, or lighted on<br>\
him, he (the latter) being غَافِل [i. e. unmindful,<br>\
&amp;c.]: or he made him to be غَافِل: or he called<br>\
him, or named him, غَافِل: and in like manner<br>\
↓ غفّلهُ, inf. n. تَغْفِيلٌ: (TA:) or تَغْفِيلٌ signifies<br>\
the calling [one] unmindful, &amp;c.: and the rendering [one] stupid, or foolish. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And اغفلهُ<br>\
signifies also He asked him [for, or respecting, a<br>\
thing] in the time of his occupation, not waiting<br>\
for the time of his freedom therefrom. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\

تغفّلهُ He watched for his unmindfulness, forgetfulness, negligence, heedlessness, or inadvertence;<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb;) as also عَنْهُ ↓ تغافل, (S, O,)<br>\
and ↓ استغفلهُ: (TA:) تغافل [as trans.] in this<br>\
sense [without a prep.] is a mistake. (Mgh.)<br>\
6<br>\
تغافل He feigned himself unmindful, forgetful, neglectful, heedless, or inadvertent; not being<br>\
so really. (Msb.) [And] He was intentionally,<br>\
or purposely, unmindful, forgetful, &amp;c.; as also<br>\
↓ تغفّل: (K:) or the former has this meaning:<br>\
but ↓ تغفّل signifies he was deceived, or circumvented, in a state of unmindfulness, forgetfulness,<br>\
&amp;c. (TA.) تغافل عَنْهُ: see 5. It means [also]<br>\
He was unmindful, &amp;c., of him, or it: or he<br>\
feigned himself unmindful, &amp;c., of him, or it.<br>\

though they made every portion thereof to be<br>\
what is termed غُفْلٌ: and بِلَادٌ أَغْفَالٌ, meaning<br>\
[tracts of country] wherein are no way-marks by<br>\
which to be directed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A road, or<br>\

to it, and no fine: (O, K:) [or,] accord. to Lh,<br>\
one says قِدَاحٌ غُفْلٌ, using the sing. form [of the<br>\
epithet] meaning [gaming arrows] in which are<br>\
no notches, and to which is assigned no portion<br>\
and no fine: they used to be added to give additional weight to the collection of arrows from fear<br>\
of occasioning suspicion [of foul play], i. e. to increase the number: and they were four; the first<br>\
[called] المُصَدَّرُ; the next, المُضَعَّفُ; the next,<br>\
المَنِيحُ; and the next, السَّفِيحُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
A beast (دَابَّةٌ) having no brand upon it: (S, O,<br>\
K:) and a she-camel that is not branded, in order<br>\
that the poor-rate may not be [considered as] incumbent for her: and ↓ غُفُلٌ is a dial. var. thereof,<br>\
or is used by poetic license: the pl. is أَغْفَالٌ.<br>\

or cattle, (نَعَمٌ,) that yield no milk. (TA.) ―<br>\
