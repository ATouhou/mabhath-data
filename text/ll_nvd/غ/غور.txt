gone quickly; and انجد, has risen; and that the<br>\
poet does not mean has come to the low lands nor<br>\
to the high lands; holding غار only to signify the<br>\
coming to the low land: but Fr asserts that اغار<br>\
is a dial. var. of غار; and cites this verse as<br>\
authority: and some say اغار وانجد, but when<br>\
they do not conjoin the two verbs they say غار;<br>\
like as they say هَنَأَنِى الطَّعَامُ وَمَرَأَنِى, but when<br>\
they do not conjoin these two verbs they say<br>\
أَمْرَأَنِى: (S:) As also mentions another relation<br>\
