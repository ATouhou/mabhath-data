غَتِمَ, aor.<br>\
غَتَمَ, inf. n. غَتَمٌ, He had an impotence, or an impediment, or a difficulty, in his<br>\
speech, or utterance; and a barbarousness, or<br>\
vitiousness, therein, especially in speaking Arabic;<br>\
i. e., a want of clearness, perspicuousness, distinctness, chasteness, or correctness, therein. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
غَتَمَ, said of food (طَعَام), It was, or became, wholesome, or beneficial. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اغتم الزِّيَارَةَ, (K, TA, in the CK [erroneously]<br>\
اغْتَتَمَ,) He visited much, so as to weary. (K, TA.)<br>\
One says, لَا تُغْتِمِ الزِّيَارَةَ فَتُمِلَّ [Do not thou visit<br>\
much, so as to weary]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And they said,<br>\
كَانَ العَجَّاجُ يُغْتِمُ الشِّعْرَ i. e. El-&#39;Ajjáj used to make<br>\
poetry cause much wearying: and it is said in the<br>\
A, أَغْتَمَ آلُ العَجَّاجِ الرَّجْزَ i. e. The family of El-<br>\
&#39;Ajjáj recited much poetry of the metre termed<br>\
رَجَز; and he among them. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اغتتم He suffered from indigestion (K, TA)<br>\
in consequence of much eating; and became affected<br>\
by what is termed ↓ غَتْم [app. meaning heat of the<br>\
stomach so intense as to take the breath] arising<br>\
from the distress occasioned by repletion. (TA.)<br>\
غَتْمٌ Intense heat that almost takes away the<br>\
breath. (S, K.) A rájiz says, (S,) namely,<br>\
Mes&#39;ood Ibn-Keyd [?] El-Fezáree, (TA,) describing camels, (S in art. فل,)<br>\
حَرَّقَهَا حَمْضُ بِلَادِ فِلِّ<br>\
وَغَتْمُ نَجْمٍ غَيْرِ مُسْتَقِلِّ<br>\
[The pasturage termed حمض of tracts of country<br>\
not rained upon and not having fresh herbage rendered them thirsty, and the intense and almostsuffocating heat of a star not high (above the<br>\
horizon), i. e. not having become high so as to<br>\
be concealed by the rays of the sun]; i. e. [a<br>\
star] not high (غَيْرِ مُرْتَفِعٍ) because of the constancy<br>\
of the heat attributed to it [at the time of its<br>\
auroral rising]; the heat becoming intense only<br>\
at the time of the [auroral] rising of الشِّعْرَى,<br>\
[meaning Sirius, the star to which allusion is<br>\
here made,] which is in [correctly after] الجَوْزَآء.<br>\
(S. [See الشِّعْرَى.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 8.<br>\
غُتْمٌ Thick pieces [or clots or lumps] of milk.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
غُتْمَةٌ An impotence, or an impediment, or a<br>\
difficulty, in speech, or utterance; and a barbarousness, or vitiousness, therein; i. e. a want of clearness, perspicuousness, distinctness, chasteness, or<br>\
correctness, therein; meaning, in speaking Arabic;<br>\
syn. عُجْمَةٌ. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.)<br>\
غُتْمِىٌّ: see أَغْتَمُ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, applied to milk,<br>\
[and so, accord. to Reiske, as stated in Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Lex., ↓ أَغْتَمُ,] Thick; the pouring forth of which<br>\
is without any sound. (IAar, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And One<br>\
who is heavy in spirit: from غُتْمٌ signifying as<br>\
expl. above. (TA.)<br>\
حِيَاضُ غُتَيْمٍ, like زُبَيْر, (so in copies of the K,)<br>\
[or حياض غُتَيْمَ, for it is] a proper name for المَنِيَّةُ,<br>\
(TA,) meaning Death, (K, TA,) like شَعُوبُ, imperfectly decl. [as being a proper name and of the<br>\
fem. gender]; so says Z; and, accord. to Lh,<br>\
الغُتَيْمُ signifies the same, but ISd says, “I know<br>\
it not save as from him. ” (TA.) One says, أَوْرَدَهُ<br>\
حِيَاضَ غُتَيْم [He brought him to death]: and in<br>\
like manner, وَقَعَ فِى أَحْوَاضِ غُتَيْم [He fell into<br>\
death], expl. by Lh as meaning he died. (TA.)<br>\
أَغْتَمُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ↓ غُتْمِىٌّ, (S, * K, *<br>\
TA,) [and ↓ أَغْتَمِىٌّ, occurring in the فاكهة الخلفآء,<br>\
p. 151, 1. 18, as mentioned by Freytag, who explains it as meaning “ barbarus,”] One who does<br>\
not utter anything with clearness, perspicuousness,<br>\
or distinctness, or with chasteness, or correctness;<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) i. q. أَعْجَمُ: (TA:) fem.<br>\
of the first, غَتْمَآءُ, applied to a woman: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) pl. of the first غُتْمٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and<br>\
أَغْتَامٌ, (Mgh,) or this latter is pl. of the second.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also غُتْمِىٌّ.<br>\
أَغْتَمِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مَغْتُومٌ, Burned by the heat. (TA.)<br>\
