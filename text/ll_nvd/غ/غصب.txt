غَصَبَهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
غَصِبَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. غَصْبٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb;) and ↓ اغتصبهُ;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) He took it wrongfully, unjustly, or<br>\
injuriously; (S, A, Mgh, K;) or by force; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) مِنْهُ and عَلَيْهِ [i. e. from him], both meaning the same. (S.) الغَصْبُ repeatedly occurs in<br>\
the traditions, signifying The taking another&#39;s<br>\
property wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or by<br>\
violence. (L.) But as employed in law, it means<br>\
The taking property that has a price and is forbidden, without the permission of its owner, without stealthiness: therefore it does not rightly apply<br>\
in the case of an animal that has died a natural<br>\
death or not been slaughtered according to the<br>\
law, because it is not property; nor in the case<br>\
of the free person, in like manner; nor in the<br>\
case of the wine of the Muslim, because it has<br>\
not a price; nor in the case of the property of<br>\
him with whom one is at war, because it is not<br>\
forbidden; the saying “ without the permission<br>\
of the owner ” precludes the trust, or deposit;<br>\
and the saying “ without stealthiness ” excludes<br>\
theft. (KT.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, غَصَبْتُهُ مَالًا and<br>\
غَصَبْتُ مِنْهُ مَالًا I took property from him [wrongfully, &amp;c., or] by force. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And غَصَبَهَا<br>\
نَفْسَهَا (Msb, TA) and نفسها ↓ اغتصبها (Msb) (tropical:)  He<br>\
violated her; forced her; had connection with her<br>\
against her will; (TA;) or constuprated her by<br>\
force. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And غَصَبَ فُلَانًا عَلَى الشَّىْءِ<br>\
(K, TA) and ↓ اغتصبه (TA) He compelled such a<br>\
one by force to do the thing. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
غَصَبَ الجِلْدَ, (K, TA,) inf. n. as above, (TA,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He removed from the skin its hair and its fur by<br>\
plucking and peeling, without subjecting it to the<br>\
process termed عَطْنٌ, in the tan, and without<br>\
إِغْمَال [i. e. burying it] in moist earth, (K, TA,)<br>\
or [soaking it in] urine [to loosen the hair and<br>\
fur], and without folding it up: so Az heard it<br>\
expl. by the Arabs. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
غاصبهُ إِيَّاهُ, accord. to Freytag, signifies He<br>\
took it from him by violence: but for this he has<br>\
not named any authority.]<br>\

إِغْتَصَبَ see 1, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, of<br>\
a woman, اُغْتُصِبَتْ نَفْسَهَا, meaning (tropical:)  She was constuprated by force; (A, Mgh, Msb;) as also<br>\
اُغْتُصِبَتْ عَلَى نَفْسِهَا. (Msb.)<br>\
غَصْبٌ and ↓ مَغْصُوبٌ A thing taken wrongfully,<br>\
unjustly, injuriously, (S, Mgh,) or by force: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) the former originally an inf. n. (Msb.)<br>\
غَاصِبٌ One taking, or who takes, a thing wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, (TA,) or by force:<br>\
pl. غُصَّابٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
مَغْصُوبٌ: see غَصْبٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  مَغْصُوبٌ لَهُ and مِنْهُ A<br>\
man from whom a thing has been taken [wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or] by force. (Msb.)<br>\
