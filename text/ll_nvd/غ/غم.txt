غَمَّهُ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
غَمُ3َ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
غَمٌّ, (Msb, TA,) He covered it, (S, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
veiled it, or concealed it; (TA;) namely, a thing:<br>\
(Msb, K, TA:) this is the primary meaning.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence,] one says, غُمَّ الهِلَالُ (S, Msb,<br>\
K, TA) عَلَى النَّاسِ, (S, TA,) inf. n. غَمٌّ, (TA,)<br>\
The new moon was veiled, or concealed, (S, Msb,)<br>\
to the people, (S,) by clouds, or otherwise, (S,<br>\
Msb,) or was intercepted by thin clouds, (K, TA,)<br>\
or otherwise, (TA,) so that it was not seen. (S,<br>\
Msb, TA.) It is said in a trad., فَإِنْ غُمَّ عَلَيْكُمْ<br>\
فَأَكْمِلُوا العِدَّةَ, (Mgh, * Msb, TA,) i. e. And if it<br>\
[the new moon] be veiled, &amp;c., to you, then complete ye the reckoning of Shaabán, thirty [days], in<br>\
order that the entering upon the fast of Ramadán<br>\
may be with [inferential] knowledge. (Msb.) Az<br>\
says that غُمَّ and أُغْمِىَ and غُمِىَ all signify the<br>\
same: (TA:) and all three occur in the trad.<br>\
above mentioned accord. to different relations<br>\
thereof. (Mgh.) [See also 1 in art. غمى.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And [hence] غَمَّ القَمَرُ النُّجُومَ The moon concealed<br>\
the stars: or almost concealed the light of the stars.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And غُمَّ عَلَيْهِ الخَبَرُ The information, or<br>\
narration, was dubious, confused, or vague, to<br>\
him; such as to be difficult to be understood; or<br>\
such as not to be understood; (S, K;) like أُغْمِىَ:<br>\
(S:) or was obscure, or unapparent, to him.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And غَمَّهُ, (S, K, TA,) aor.<br>\
غَمُ3َ, inf. n.<br>\
غَمٌّ, (TA,) It (i. e. هَمّ [here meaning “ grief,”<br>\
see غَمٌّ below,]) covered [or was as though it<br>\
covered] his heart: (Har p. 637:) or [accord. to<br>\
common acceptation] it, or he, grieved him; or<br>\
caused him to mourn or lament, or to be sorrowful or sad or unhappy; syn. أَحْزَنَهُ. (K, and Har<br>\
p. 422. [See also 4.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  غَمَّهُ, in which the pronoun relates to an ass, &amp;c., (S, K, TA,) aor.<br>\
غَمُ3َ,<br>\
inf. n. غَمٌّ, (TA,) means He put [as a covering]<br>\
to his mouth and his nostrils the ↓ غِمَامَة, (S, K,<br>\
TA,) which is a thing like the كِعَام [or muzzle],<br>\
(so in the S and CK,) or a thing like the فِدَام<br>\
[which seems to be here similar in meaning to<br>\
كعام]: (so in other copies of the K:) or he put<br>\
[as a covering] to his mouth a nose-bag, or the<br>\
like, to prevent his feeding; and this is termed a<br>\
↓ غِمَامَة: (TA:) [the verb that I have rendered<br>\
“ put to ” in these explanations is أَلْقَمَ, of which<br>\
I do not find in its proper place any signification<br>\
that would be exactly apposite in this case:] or<br>\
↓ غِمَامَةٌ signifies a sort of bag for the mouth of<br>\
a camel and the like, (K, TA,) his mouth being<br>\
put into it: (TA:) pl. غَمَائِمُ: (S, TA:) and one<br>\
says, غَمَّهُ بِالغِمَامَةِ [he covered his mouth with the<br>\
غمامة], aor. and inf. n. as above. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  غَمَّ<br>\
الشَّىْءَ, aor.<br>\
غَمُ3َ, also signifies عَلَاهُ [app. as meaning<br>\
It rose upon, or above, the thing, as though forming a covering over it]: mentioned on the authority of IAar, who cites [as an ex.] the saying of<br>\
En-Nemir Ibn-Towlab, [app. describing a رَوْضَة,<br>\
or meadow,]<br>\
أُنُفٌ يَغُمُّ الضَّالُ نَبْتَ بِحَارِهَا<br>\
[Not depastured, the trees called ضال rising upon,<br>\
or above, the herbage of its fertile tracts, or its<br>\
tracts near to water]. (TA.) See also 8.<br>\
-A2-  [غَمَّ<br>\
is also intrans.: one says,] غَمَّ يَوْمُنَا, (S, K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. غَمٌّ and غُمُومٌ; (TA;) and ↓ أَغَمَّ; Our day<br>\
was, or became, [sultry, or] intensely hot, (S, K,<br>\
TA,) so that it took away, (S,) or almost took<br>\
away, (TA,) the breath: (S, TA:) or both verbs,<br>\
said of a day, and of the sky, mean it brought<br>\
غَمّ [or distress that affected the breath or respiration], arising from closeness of heat, or clouds.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A3-  غَمَّ الشَّخْصُ, of the class of تَعِبَ, [the<br>\
first pers. being غَمِمْتُ,] inf. n. غَمَمٌ, The person&#39;s<br>\

غَامَمْتُهُ signifies غَمَمْتُهُ وَغَمَّنِى [I grieved him,<br>\
or caused him to mourn or lament &amp;c., and he<br>\
grieved me, or caused me to mourn or lament &amp;c.;<br>\
or I grieved him &amp;c., being grieved &amp;c. by<br>\
him]. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اغمّت السَّمَآءُ The sky became clouded: (K,<br>\
as indicated by the context:) or i. q. تَغَيَّرَت [i. e.,<br>\
became altered]: thus in the S; but some say<br>\
that it is correctly تَغَيَّمَت [agreeably with the<br>\
former of the explanations above]. (TA.) See<br>\
also 1, near the end.<br>\
-A2-  مَا أَغَمَّكَ لِى and إِلَىَّ is<br>\
[an expression of wonder, meaning How great<br>\
grief, or sadness, dost thou occasion to me!] from<br>\
الغَمُّ signifying الحُزْنُ. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Accord. to<br>\
the TK, أَغَمَّهُ signifies أَحْزَنَهُ; like غَمَّهُ: but this<br>\
I think a mistake. ―<br>\
-b3-  And Freytag explains أَغَمَّ<br>\
as occurring in the Deewán of the Hudhalees<br>\
signifying “ Demersit: ” but in which of its senses<br>\
he uses this word he does not specify.]<br>\
6<br>\
تغامّ He made a show of غَمّ [or grief, &amp;c.,]<br>\
without its being in the heart. (Har p. 126.)<br>\
7<br>\
انغمّ It (a thing, K) was, or became, covered,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) veiled, or concealed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also what next follows.<br>\
8<br>\
اغتمّ He was, or became, grieved, or caused<br>\
to mourn or lament, or to be sorrowful or sad or<br>\
unhappy; (S, * K;) as also ↓ انغمّ: (K:) both<br>\
mentioned by Sb. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, said of a<br>\
plant, or herbage, It was, or became, tall, (K,<br>\
TA,) and tangled, or luxuriant, (TA,) and abundant: (K, TA:) as also اعتمّ. (TA.) [And in<br>\
like manner ↓ غَمَّ is expl. by Freytag as occurring<br>\
in the Deewán of the Hudhalees, said of a plant,<br>\
meaning It was tall and luxuriant.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And,<br>\
said of a man, He withheld himself from going<br>\
out, or forth. (TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
غَمْغَمَ, [inf. n. غَمْغَمَةٌ, He (a bull)<br>\
uttered a cry, or cries, in fright; as also ↓ تَغَمْغَمَ:<br>\
see غَمَغْمَةٌ below. ―<br>\
-b2-  And] He (a courageous<br>\
man) raised his voice conflict with his antagonist; (Har p. 531;) [as also ↓ تَغَمْغَمَ: see, again,<br>\
غَمْغَمَةٌ below.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And He [a man] spoke while<br>\
taking a thing into his fauces, so that the hearer,<br>\
or listener, did not understand what he was saying; (Har ubi suprà;) [or spoke indistinctly;<br>\
agreeably with an explanation of غَمْغَمَةٌ below;<br>\
as also ↓ تَغَمْغَمَ. ―<br>\
-b4-  And, said of a bow, It produced a sound; agreeably with another explanation of غَمْغَمَةٌ below.] ―<br>\
-b5-  Also, said of an infant,<br>\
inf. n. غَمْغَمَةٌ, He wept over the breast, desiring<br>\
the milk: [and the inf. n. is used as a simple<br>\
subst., and therefore pluralized:] IAar cites as<br>\
an ex.,<br>\
إِذَا المُرْضِعَاتُ بَعْدَ أَوَّلِ هَجْعَةٍ<br>\
↓ سَمِعْتَ عَلَى ثُدِيِّهِنَّ غَمَاغِمَا<br>\
[When the suckling women, after the first light<br>\
sleep in the beginning of the night, are in such a<br>\
condition that thou hearest cryings over their<br>\
breasts]; meaning, as he says, that the milk of<br>\
these women is little in quantity, so that the sucking child weeps over the breast when sucking it.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَغَمْغَمَ: see R. Q. 1, in three places:<br>\
and see its inf. n. voce غَمْغَمَةٌ, below, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Said of one drowning (غَرِيق) beneath<br>\
the water, it signifies He uttered a cry, or cries:<br>\
or, as is said in the T, he was pressed upon by the<br>\
waves above him: a poet uses it of Pharaoh when<br>\
he was overwhelmed [in the sea]. (TA.)<br>\
غَمٌّ [an inf. n. used as an epithet in which the<br>\
quality of a subst. predominates,] Grief, mourning, lamentation, sorrow, sadness, or unhappiness;<br>\
syn. حُزْنٌ; (Msb, K;) so called because it covers<br>\
happiness and forbearance; (Msb;) or غَمّ in the<br>\
heart is thus called because it veils, or precludes,<br>\
happiness: (Ham p. 21:) [it may therefore be<br>\
rendered gloominess of mind:] or i. q. كَرْبٌ, (K,)<br>\
which signifies حُزْن, (K in art. كرب,) or غَمّ, (S,<br>\
in that art.,) [that affects the breath or respiration, lit.] that takes away the breath; (S and K<br>\
in that art.;) as also ↓ غَمَّآءُ (K) and ↓ غُمَّةٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
the last [expl. in the S as syn. with كُرْبَةٌ, which<br>\
is syn. with كَرْبٌ, and] mentioned by Lh: (TA:)<br>\
[see also صَقَعٌ:] it is كَرْب [or grief, &amp;c.,] that<br>\
befalls the heart because of what has happened;<br>\
differing from هَمٌّ, which is كرب that befalls<br>\
because of annoyance, or harm, that is expected<br>\
to happen: or, as some say, both are one [in<br>\
meaning]: the differing is asserted by &#39;Iyád and<br>\
[many] others: (TA:) [see also غَصَبٌ:] the pl.<br>\
of غَمٌّ is غُمُومٌ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also an inf. n.<br>\
used as an epithet in the phrase يَوْمٌ غَمٌّ (S, TA)<br>\
i. e. A day that is [sultry, or] intensely hot, so<br>\
that it [almost] takes away the breath; and لَيْلَةٌ<br>\
غَمٌّ [such a night], i. e. ↓ غَامَّةٌ: (S:) or one says<br>\
يَوْمٌ غَمٌّ and ↓ غَامٌّ and ↓ مِغَمٌّ, (K, TA,) the last<br>\
with kesr to the م, (TA,) [in the CK ↓ مُغِمٌّ,]<br>\
meaning a day of heat, (K,) or of intense heat:<br>\
(TA:) or a day of غَمّ [i. e. grief, &amp;c.]: and [in<br>\
a similar sense, as is implied by the context immediately preceding,] لَيْلَةٌ غَمٌّ and غَمَّةٌ and ↓ غَمَّى:<br>\
(K:) [but] A&#39;Obeyd mentions, on the authority<br>\
of AZ, ↓ لَيْلَةٌ غَمَّى and ↓ لَيْلَةٌ غَمَّةٌ as meaning a<br>\
night in which there is over the sky [a covering of<br>\
clouds, or] what is termed غَمْىٌ [a word belonging<br>\
to art. غمى, being in measure] like رَمْىٌ; (S;)<br>\
and [in the like sense] يَوْمٌ غَمٌّ. (So in one of my<br>\
copies of the S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And one says, كَانَ عَلَى<br>\
السَّمَآءِ غم [app. غَمٌّ, but this, I think, requires<br>\
confirmation, for which I have searched in vain,]<br>\
and غمى [app. ↓ غَمَّى, or perhaps غَمْىٌ, a word<br>\
mentioned above,] meaning There was over the<br>\
sky a collection [or an expanse] of thin clouds, or<br>\
a ضَبَابَة [i. e. mist, or the like], فَحَالَ دُونَ الهِلَالِ<br>\
[and it intercepted the new moon]: and هٰذِهِ لَيْلَةُ<br>\
↓ غَمَّى, and some say ↓ غُمَّى, This is a night [of<br>\
a covering of clouds, or] of a ضَبَابَة [or mist, or<br>\
the like], intervening between the new moon and<br>\
men; so that the new moon is not seen: (Msb:)<br>\
and [hence] ↓ صُمْنَا لِلْغَمَّى, and ↓ لِلْغُمَّى, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) both mentioned by ISk on the authority of<br>\
Fr, (S,) and ↓ لِلْغَمَّآءِ, (S, K,) and ↓ لِلْغُمِّيَّةِ, (K,<br>\
TA, but omitted in the CK,) and ↓ لِلْغُمَّةِ, (TA,)<br>\
[i. e. We fasted after, or from the time of, the<br>\
covering of clouds, or the mist, or the like, that<br>\
concealed the new moon; (the prep. لِ being here<br>\
used in the sense of بَعْدَ, or مِنْ وَقْتِ, as in the<br>\
Kur xvii. 80;) virtually] meaning [we fasted]<br>\
without a sight [of the new moon]: (Msb, TA:)<br>\
a rájiz says,<br>\
طَامِسٍ هِلَالُهَا ↓ لَيْلَةَ غُمَّى<br>\
أَوْغَلْتُهَا وَمُكْرَةٌ إِيْغَالُهَا<br>\
[In a night of a covering of clouds, or of a mist,<br>\
or the like, having its new moon effaced: I journeyed quickly and far in it, (أَوْغَلْتُهَا) being used,<br>\
app. by poetic license, for أَوْغَلْتُ فِيهَا,) and disliked was the journeying so therein]: (S, TA:)<br>\
and it is said that لَيْلَةُ غمّى [i. e. ↓ غَمَّى and<br>\
↓ غُمَّى] signifies also the last night of the [lunar]<br>\
month; being so called because the case thereof<br>\
is veiled to people so that it is not known whether<br>\
it be of the coming [month] or of the past. (TA.)<br>\
غَمَّةٌ fem. of غَمٌّ, q. v., used as an epithet.<br>\

or confusedness: (Msb:) and هُوَ فِى غُمَّةٍ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He is in a state of perplexity and darkness [in<br>\
respect of his case or affair]; from الغَمُّ signifying “ the act of covering ” [a thing]. (Ham p.<br>\

(tropical:)  [Then let not your case be to you one of] darkness, and straitness, and anxiety: (A&#39;Obeyd, S,<br>\

(TA.)<br>\
غَمَمٌ is the inf. n. of 1 in the last of the senses<br>\
expl. above: (Msb:) or it signifies The flowing<br>\
