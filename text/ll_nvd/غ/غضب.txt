غَضَبْ (S, Msb, K *) and مَغْضَبَةٌ, (S, K, *) He was<br>\
angry with him; (MA, K, * PS, &amp;c.;) and ↓ تغضّب<br>\
عليه signifies the same. (Msb.) [See الغَضَبُ<br>\
below.] And غَضِبَ مِنْ لَاشَىْءٍ i. e. [He was<br>\
angry] for nothing; meaning, for no cause. (Msb.<br>\
[لاشىء, in a case of this kind, is regarded as one<br>\
word, and is therefore as above, not لَا شَىْءِ: see<br>\
p. 1626, third col.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  غَضِبَ لَهُ (meaning He<br>\
was angry with another person for his sake, or<br>\
on his account, TA) is said when the person [on<br>\
whose account the anger is excited] is living:<br>\
and غَضِبَ بِهِ, when he is dead: (S, A, Msb, K:)<br>\
so says El-Umawee, and El-Ahmar says the like.<br>\

غُِضَاب [q. v.]. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And غضبت عَيْنُهُ,<br>\
with fet-h and kesr [i. e., app., غَضِبَتْ; or “ with<br>\
fet-h and kesr ” may be a mistranscription for<br>\
“ with damm and kesr,” so that the verb may be<br>\
غُضِبَتْ; His eye had in it what are termed غُِضَاب].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
غَاضَبْتُهُ I made him angry, he also making<br>\
me angry. (K.) ―<br>\

boiled fiercely عَلَى اللَّحْمِ [upon the flesh-meat].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
غَضْبٌ (S, K) Red (S) intense in redness: (S, K:)<br>\
you say أَحْمَرُ غَضْبٌ: so says ISk: (S:) or غَضْبٌ<br>\
signifies أَحْمَرُ غَضْبٌ (K) i. e. red that is dense, or<br>\

غَضَبٌ an inf. n. of غَضِبَ [q. v.]. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
الغَضَبُ is The contr. of الرِّضَى: (K, TA:) it is<br>\
variously defined: some say that it is a state of<br>\
excitement of the blood of the heart for the purpose<br>\
of revenge: some say that pain on account of<br>\
anything reparable is غَضَب; and for anything<br>\
irreparable, أَسَف: some say that it [is a passion<br>\
which] includes all that is evil; wherefore the<br>\
Prophet, to a man who asked of him a precept,<br>\
said, لَا تَغْضَبْ: and some say that الغَضَب is [a<br>\
passion] accompanied by an eagerness to obtain<br>\
revenge; and الغَمّ is accompanied by despair of<br>\
obtaining it: (TA: [see also غَيْظٌ:]) there is a<br>\
غَضَب that is commended, and a غَضَب that is<br>\
discommended; the former being that which is<br>\
for the sake of religion and truth, or right; and<br>\
the latter being that which is in a wrong case:<br>\
and the غَضَب of God is his disapproving of the<br>\
conduct of him who disobeys Him, and whom He<br>\
will therefore punish. (Ibn- &#39;Arafeh, TA.)<br>\
