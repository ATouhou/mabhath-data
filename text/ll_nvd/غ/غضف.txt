the upper part [of each] of the two ears, upon, or<br>\
over, the concha thereof, by reason of its width<br>\
and its largeness: (TA:) Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee says, after citing a verse of Abu-n-Nejm,<br>\
describing a lion, that it signifies a twisting, in<br>\
the ear, backwards: accord. to ISh, it is, in the<br>\
lion, a laxness, or pendulousness, of the upper eyelids, upon the eyes; arising from anger and pride:<br>\
(O:) and he says that, accord. to some, it is, in<br>\
the lion, abundance of the fur, and a folding, or<br>\
creasing, of the skin. (TA.) And one says, [app.<br>\

its uppermost part it has green سَعَف [or branches<br>\
like those of the palm-tree], (Lth, O, K,) covered<br>\
[thereby]: (Lth, O:) AHn says, it is a plant<br>\
resembling the palm-tree exactly, (O, L, TA,) but<br>\
not growing tall, (TA,) having many سَعَف, and<br>\
prickles, and [leaves such as are termed] خُوص,<br>\

and particularly what is said at the end of the<br>\
paragraph thus headed.])<br>\
-A2-  Also An [eminence<br>\
of the kind called] أَكَمَة. (O, K, TA. [For اكمة,<br>\
in this case, the TK has most strangely substituted اكمه, meaning أَكْمَهُ, for it explains it<br>\
as signifying “ blind from the birth; ” and this,<br>\
though an obvious mistake, Freytag asserts to be<br>\
the right reading and explanation.])<br>\
