غَمَصَهُ, (S, A, Mgh, K,) aor.<br>\
غَمِصَ inf. n. غَمْصٌ;<br>\
(S;) and غَمِصَهُ, aor.<br>\
غَمَصَ, inf. n. غَمْصٌ; and غَمِصَهُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
غَمَصَ, inf. n. غَمَصٌ; (K, * TA;) but the first is<br>\
the most chaste; (TA;) He despised him; held<br>\
him in contempt; (A, Mgh, K;) accounted him<br>\
little, or vile; regarded him as nothing; (S;) as<br>\
also ↓ اغتمصهُ. (S, A, K.) You say also, رَآهُ<br>\
فَغَمَصَتْهُ عَيْنُهُ He saw him and his eye despised<br>\
him. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He blamed him; found fault<br>\
with him; imputed to him a vice, or fault; and<br>\
despised his right. (A, K.) You say, وَجَدَتْ<br>\
النَّاسَ يَغْمِصُ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا [I found the people<br>\
blaming one another, &amp;c.]; as also ↓ يَغْتَمِصُ.<br>\
(A.) And غَمَصْتَهُ بِسُوْءٍ [Thou imputedst evil to<br>\
him]. (TA, from a trad.) And غَمَصْتُ عَلَيْهِ قَوْلًا<br>\
قَالَهُ I blamed him, or found fault with him, for<br>\
a saying that he said. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, (TA,)<br>\
غَمَصَ النِّعْمَةَ, (S, K,) and غَمِصَهَا, (K,) the latter<br>\
is the form authorized by the T and the Deewán<br>\
el-Adab, this verb and [its syn.] غمط being there<br>\
said to be both with kesr to the م, (TA,) He<br>\
was ungrateful, or unthankful, for the favour or<br>\
benefit; (S, K, TA;) he despised it, and disacknowledged it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence also, app.,]<br>\
غَمَصَ اللّٰهُ الخَلْقَ God diminished the height, and<br>\
breadth, and strength, and might in war, or<br>\
valour, of mankind; and made them small and<br>\
contemptible: occurring in a trad. of &#39;Alee respecting the slaughter of his brother by a son of<br>\
Adam. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  غَمَصَتْ عَيْنُهُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
غَمَصَ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. غَمَصٌ, (S,) His eye had in it what is<br>\
termed غَمَصٌ, q. v. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps,]<br>\
غَمِصَ هٰذَا الأَمْرُ عَلَىَّ This thing, or affair, turned<br>\
against me, and became attended with trouble.<br>\
(JK.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence, perhaps,] لَا تَغْمَصْ عَلَىَّ<br>\
[in the CK تَغْمِصْ] Be not thou angry with me:<br>\
so accord. to the O [and the JK]: but accord.<br>\
to the K, do not thou lie against me, or utter<br>\
falsehood. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِغْتَمَصَ see 1, in two places.<br>\
غَمَصٌ Fluid filth [or foul matter] in the inner<br>\
corner of the eye: (Mgh:) or what is fluid of<br>\
[the filth, or foul matter, or white filth, which<br>\
collects in the inner corner of the eye, and which,<br>\
when concrete, is called] رَمَص: (S, K:) or a<br>\
thing like froth, which the eye emits; a portion<br>\
whereof is termed ↓ غَمَصَةٌ: (TA:) or what resembles white froth, in the side of the eye: but<br>\
رَمَصٌ is in the side of the eyelashes: (ISh:) or<br>\
both these words signify dirt which the eye<br>\
emits: or غَمَصٌ is what is concrete. (M in art.<br>\
رمص.)<br>\
غَمِصٌ, a possessive epithet, A great imputer of<br>\
vices or faults. (TA.)<br>\
غَمَصَةٌ: see غَمَصٌ.<br>\
يَمِينٌ غَمُوصٌ i. q. غَمُوسٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  هُوَ غَمُوصُ الحَنْجَرَةِ<br>\
He is a liar. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
-A2-  الغَمُوصُ: see<br>\
الغُمَيْصَآءُ.<br>\
مَا فِى فُلَانٍ غَمِيصَةٌ There is not in such a one<br>\
anything for which his character is to be impugned, or for which he is to be blamed, censured,<br>\
or spoken against; any vice, or fault; i. q.<br>\
غَمِيزَةٌ. (A.)<br>\
غُمَيْصَآءُ dim. of غَمْصَآءُ [fem. of أَغْمَصُ]. (TA.)<br>\
Hence, (TA,) الغُمَيْصَآءُ [The star Procyon;] one<br>\
of the شِعْرَيَانِ, (S, K,) whereof the other is<br>\
الشِّعْرَى العَبُورُ [i. e. Sirius]: (TA:) the former is<br>\
also called ↓ الغَمُوصُ, (S, K,) and الرُّمَيْصَآءُ,<br>\
(TA,) and الشِّعْرَى الشَّامِيَّةُ: (IAth:) it is one of<br>\
the Mansions of the Moon [accord. to those who<br>\
make the term نَوْءٌ to signify the auroral setting;<br>\
namely, the Seventh]; (TA;) and is in the ذِرَاع;<br>\
(S;) i. e., it is the greater of the two stars called<br>\
الذِّرَاعُ المَقْبُوضَةُ: (IAth:) it is called الغميصاء<br>\
because of its smallness and its littleness of light<br>\
[in comparison with the other شعرى], from غَمَصُ<br>\
العَيْنِ: (TA:) [or the reason of its being so<br>\
called is this:] the Arabs assert that the شِعْرَيَانِ<br>\
are the sisters of سُهَيْل [or Canopus]; (IDrd, S;)<br>\
and that they [three] were together; but that<br>\
سهيل descended into the south, and الشِّعْرَى<br>\
اليَمَانِيَّةُ [which is Sirius] followed it; (IDrd;)<br>\
this latter, they say, crossed the Milky way, and<br>\
was therefore named العَبُورُ; and الغميصاء<br>\
remained in her place, weeping for the loss of the<br>\
two others until her eye became affected with<br>\
غَمَص: (IDrd, K: *) they also assert that thou<br>\
seest العبور when she rises as though she desired<br>\
to cross [the Milky Way] (كَأَنَّهَا تَسْتَعْبِرُ); but<br>\
الغميصاء thou seest not [as yet in any part of<br>\
Arabia], she having wept until she has become<br>\
affected with غَمَص. (S.)<br>\
أَغْمَصُ Having, in his eye, what is termed<br>\
غَمَصٌ, q. v.: (Mgh, K:) or disordered in the eye;<br>\
whose eyes are dim, or watery; like أَعْمَشُ: (L<br>\
and TA in art. عمش:) fem. غَمْصَآءُ: and pl. غُمْصٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
هُوَ مَغْمُوصٌ عَلَيْهِ He is censured, or blamed, or<br>\
reproached, (S, K,) with respect to his religion,<br>\
(S, A, K,) and with respect to his grounds of<br>\
pretension to respect. (A.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
إِلَّا مَغْموصٌ عَلَيْهِ النِّفَاقُ, meaning, Except one<br>\
censured, &amp;c., with respect to his religion; accused,<br>\
or suspected, of hypocrisy. (TA.)<br>\
أَنَا مُسْتَغْمِصٌ مِنْ هٰذَا الخَبَرِ وَمُتَوَهِّمٌ [I am<br>\
suspicious of this information, and opining;] is<br>\
said by one when a piece of information rejoices<br>\
him but he fears that it may not be true; or<br>\
when he fears it and yet it rejoices him. (TA.)<br>\
