غَبَّتِ الإِبِلُ, (S,) or المَاشِيَةُ, (Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
غَبِ3َ,<br>\
inf. n. غَبٌّ (S, Msb, K) and غُبُوبٌ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
The camels, (S,) or cattle, (Msb, K,) came to<br>\
water, (S,) or drank, (Msb, K,) on alternate<br>\
days; one day and not the next day. (S, Msb,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (IAth, TA,) غَبَّ said of a man<br>\
means He came visiting at intervals of some days,<br>\
or after some days. (AA, IAth, TA.) [See also<br>\
غِبٌّ: and see غُبَيْسٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And غَبَّ عَنِ القَوْمِ,<br>\
(Ks, S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
غَبُ3َ, the verb in this case<br>\
being of the class of قَتَلَ, [but this is contr. to<br>\
analogy, as well as to the derivation,] inf. n. غِبٌّ,<br>\
with kesr, He came to the people, or party, day<br>\
after day: (Msb:) or, as also القَوْمَ ↓ اغبّ, he<br>\
came to the people, or party, on alternate days,<br>\
coming one day and not the next: (Ks, S, K:) or<br>\
he came to them once in two days or more. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., فِى عِيَادَةِ المَرِيضِ ↓ أَغِبُّوا<br>\
وَأَرْبِعُوا Visit ye the sick on alternate days and<br>\
after intervals of two days: (S, TA:) not every<br>\
day, lest he find your visits to be troublesome.<br>\
(TA. [See also art. ربع.]) And you say,<br>\
↓ أَغْبَبْتُهُ, inf. n. إِغْبَابٌ, meaning I visited him<br>\
[once] in every week. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And hence غَبَّتْ<br>\
said of a fever. (Msb.) غَبَّتِ الحُمَّى and<br>\
↓ أَغَبَّت signify the same: (S:) you say, غَبَّتْ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ الحُمَّى, The fever came upon him, (Msb,)<br>\
or attacked him, (K,) one day and intermitted<br>\
one day; (Msb, K;) as also ↓ أَغَبَّتْهُ and ↓ أَغَبَّتْ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ. (K.) [See also غِبٌّ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  You say also,<br>\
غَبَّ عِنْدَنَا, (S, L, K,) and ↓ اغبّ, (L, K,) He<br>\
passed the night, or a night, at our abode. (S, L,<br>\
K.) Hence the saying, رُوَيْدَ الشِّعْرَ يَغِبَّ [so accord. to the TA, حَتَّى being understood, accord.<br>\
to the explanation of Meyd, but in the CK, and<br>\
in one of my copies of the S, and in Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Prov. i. 522, يَغِبُّ,] (S, K,) i. e. Leave<br>\
thou the poetry until some days shall have passed,<br>\
that thou mayest see what will be its result,<br>\
whether it will be praised or dispraised: (Meyd,<br>\
TA:) or it may be from غَبَّت said of a fever, and<br>\
may thus mean, leave thou the poetry to be kept<br>\
back from people, [or to be intermitted,] i. e. do<br>\
not repeat it to people in an uninterrupted manner,<br>\
lest they become weary. (Meyd. [See also art.<br>\
رود.]) ―<br>\
-b6-  And [hence] غَبَّ, (T, S, L, Msb, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
غَبِ3َ, (L, Msb,) inf. n. غَبٌّ and غِبٌّ and غُبُوبٌ<br>\
and غُبُوبَةٌ, (L,) said of food, (L, Msb,) and of<br>\
dates, or especially of flesh-meat as some say,<br>\
(L,) It remained throughout a night, whether it<br>\
became corrupt or not: (L, Msb:) and, said of<br>\
food, it became altered [for the worse] in its<br>\
odour: (L:) or, said of flesh-meat, it became<br>\
stinking: (T, S, K;) as also ↓ اغبّ: (T, K:)<br>\
and it (a thing) became corrupt. (TA. [See also<br>\
2.]) ―<br>\
-b7-  غَبَّتِ الأُمُورُ means The affairs, or events,<br>\
came to, or arrived at, their ends, conclusions,<br>\
latter or last parts or states, issues, or results. (S,<br>\

غبّب فِى الحَاجَةِ, (S, O,) inf. n. تَغْبِيبٌ, (K,)<br>\
He was remiss; or did not exert himself, or act<br>\
vigorously or strenuously; (S, O, K;) in the needful affair: (S, O:) [and] so فِيهَا ↓ تغبّب [if not<br>\
a mistranscription]. (Thus in a copy of the A.)<br>\
[Hence,] كَتَبَ إِلَيْهِ يُغَبِّبُ مِنْ هُلْكِ المُسْلِمِينَ,<br>\
(TA,) or عَنْ هَلَاكِ المسلمين, (thus in the O,)<br>\
(tropical:)  He wrote to him not acquainting him with the<br>\
great number that had perished of the Muslims:<br>\
(O, TA:) a metaphorical mode of expression;<br>\
as though he were remiss, or fell short, in making<br>\
known the essential state of the case. (TA, from<br>\
a trad.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And غبّب signifies also It (a thing)<br>\
became very corrupt. (TA. [See also 1, last<br>\
sentence but two.])<br>\
-A2-  غبّب الشَّاةَ, (O, L, *) inf. n.<br>\
as above, (L, K,) He (a wolf) seized the sheep,<br>\
or goat, by its throat, (O, K,) and fixed his<br>\

اغبّ الإِبِلَ He watered the camels on alternate<br>\
days: (S, O, Msb: *) from غِبٌّ [q. v.]. (S, O.)<br>\
-A3-  And أَغَبَّنِى is said by Th to signify وَقَعَ بِى<br>\
[app. meaning He fell upon me in fight]. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَغبّب is app. from الغِبُّ in the sense of<br>\
العَاقِبَةُ, and thus syn. with تَعَقَّبَ signifying He<br>\
looked to the consequence, end, issue, or result, of<br>\
an affair: see its part. n. مُتَغَبِّبْ, below.] ―<br>\

the water in the second of two nights (as is shown<br>\
by the context of a passage in which it occurs in<br>\
the S and O and K voce طَلَقٌ), or in the second<br>\

an old woman: (Ks, TA:) and, metaphorically,<br>\
