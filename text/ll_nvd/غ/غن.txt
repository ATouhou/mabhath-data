غَنَّ, (MA, Msb, K,) originally غَنِنَ, (Msb,<br>\
MF,) [sec. pers. غَنِنْتَ,] aor. يَغِنُّ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. غُنَّةٌ (MA, KL) and غَنَنٌ, (MA, [and the<br>\
same seems to be indicated in the Msb by its<br>\
being said that the verb is of the class of تَعِبَ,])<br>\
or غَنٌّ, (TK, [but this I think a mistake,]) He<br>\
spoke (MA, Msb, KL) in, (MA,) or from, (Msb,<br>\
KL,) or [rather] through, (KL,) his nose, (MA,<br>\
KL,) or his خَيَاشِيم [app. here meaning the innermost parts of the air-passages of the nose]. (Msb.)<br>\
[The author of the K gives no indication of the<br>\
proper signification of this verb but that of its<br>\
implying what he states to be meant by غُنَّةٌ,<br>\
which see below.] ―<br>\

[q. v.]. (K.) One says, مَا أَدْرِى مَا غَنَّنَهُ I know<br>\

-b2-  And غنّن صَوْتَهُ He made his<br>\
voice to have in it a غُنَّة [q. v.]. (Mughnee, art.<br>\
حَرْفُ النُّونِ. [See مُغَنٍّ, voce غَنَّآءٌ, in art. غنى.])<br>\

اغنّ said of a man, He made one to hear his<br>\

اغنّ الوَادِى (tropical:)  The valley had in it the sound [or<br>\
humming] of flies, [or resounded therewith,] being<br>\

beautiful and bright. (K, TA.)<br>\
غُنَّةٌ [mentioned above as an inf. n. of غَنَّ but<br>\
generally expl. as a simple subst. signifying A<br>\
sort of nasal sound, or twang:] a sound that<br>\
comes forth from the nose; (Ham p. 339;) a sound<br>\
(S, Msb) in, (S,) or that comes forth from, (Msb,)<br>\
the خَيْشُوم [app. here meaning the innermost part<br>\
of the air-passages of the nose]: (S, Msb:) or a<br>\
sound from the لَهَاة [q. v., app. here meaning the<br>\
arches, or pillars, of the soft palate, or the furthest<br>\
part of the mouth,] and the nose, like [that which<br>\
is heard in the utterance of] the ن of مِنْكَ and<br>\
عَنْكَ, for the tongue has not part in it: (Mgh:)<br>\
or the flowing [or passage] of the speech in the لَهَاة<br>\
[app. here also meaning as expl. above]: (K:) or<br>\
a mixture of the sound of the خَيْشُوم [expl. above]<br>\
in the pronunciation of a letter: (Mbr, TA:) ن<br>\
is that one of the letters in which it is greatest in<br>\
degree: (Kh, Mgh, Msb, TA:) خُنَّةٌ is [a sound]<br>\
greater in degree than غُنَّةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also The<br>\
roughness of the voice, of a boy, consequent upon<br>\
the attaining to puberty; or, as Mtr says,] الغُنَّةُ<br>\
signifies also what is incident to the boy on the<br>\
occasion of his attaining to puberty, when his voice<br>\
becomes rough. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A soft, or gentle,<br>\
plaintive, and melodious, voice, in singing. (Har<br>\

and another voce عُنَّةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And the poet Yezeed<br>\
Ibn-El-Aawar has used it in relation to the sounding of stones: (K:) [or rather] he has so used<br>\

عُنَانٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, near<br>\
the end.<br>\
أَغَنُّ One who speaks [with a nasal sound, or<br>\
twang, i. e.] in [or rather through] his nose; (TA;)<br>\

(as expl. before) the innermost parts of the airpassages of the nose]: (S, Msb:) or, accord. to<br>\
AZ, (Mgh, TA,) whose speech flows, (Mgh, K, *)<br>\
or passes forth, (TA,) in his لَهَاة [app. (as expl.<br>\
voce غُنَّةٌ) the arches, or pillars, of the soft palate,<br>\
or the furthest part of the mouth]: (Mgh, K, TA:)<br>\
fem. غَنَّآءُ, applied to a woman. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also<br>\
applied to a gazelle (ظَبْىٌ), meaning Whose cry<br>\
issues from his خَيَاشِيم [expl. above]: J has erred<br>\
in saying that it is applied to طَيْر [i. e. birds, or<br>\
flying things]: (K:) or if by طير he mean flies<br>\
(ذُبَابٌ), his saying thus is not a mistake, for it is<br>\
applied to them [as meaning making a humming<br>\
sound]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] وَادٍ أَغَنُّ (assumed tropical:)  A valley<br>\
abounding with herbs or herbage: for to such the<br>\
flies constantly keep, and in their sounds is a غُنَّة.<br>\

one says رَوْضَةٌ غَنَّآءُ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [A meadow, or garden,]<br>\
abounding with herbs or herbage: or in which the<br>\
winds pass with a sound that is not clear, [i. e.<br>\
with a confused, humming, or murmuring, sound,]<br>\
by reason of the denseness of its herbs or herbage.<br>\
(K, TA.) And [for the same reason one says]<br>\
عُشْبٌ أَغَنُّ (assumed tropical:)  Herbs, or herbage, tall, full-grown,<br>\
or of full height, and in blossom. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
(hence also, S) قَرْيَةٌ غَنَّآءُ (tropical:)  [A town, or village,]<br>\
abounding with inhabitants (S, K, TA) and buildings (K, TA) and herbs or herbage [so that in it<br>\
is heard the hum of men and women and of flies<br>\
&amp;c.]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  حَرْفٌ أَغْنُّ means A letter from<br>\
[the utterance of] which results what is termed<br>\
غُنَّة [i. e. the nasal sound thus termed]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
See also غُنَّةٌ, last sentence.<br>\
وَادٍ مُغِنٌّ (tropical:)  A valley in which is [heard] the<br>\
sound [or humming] of flies; these not being in any<br>\
valley but such as abounds with herbs or herbage;<br>\
(S;) a valley of which the flies are abundant, by<br>\
reason of the denseness, or luxuriance, of its herbs<br>\
or herbage, so that a غُنَّة [or humming] is heard,<br>\
produced by their flying: the epithet being applied<br>\
to it, but being properly applicable to the flies.<br>\
(TA.) [See also أَغَنُّ.]<br>\
