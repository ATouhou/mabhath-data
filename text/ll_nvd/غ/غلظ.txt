غَلُظَ, aor.<br>\
غَلُظَ; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) and غَلَظَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
غَلِظَ; (Sgh, K;) inf. n. [of the former] غِلَظٌ (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, K) and ↓ غِلَاظَةٌ and ↓ غِلْظَةٌ (S, *<br>\
O, K, * TK) and ↓ غُلْظَةٌ and ↓ غَلْظَةٌ, (O, K, *<br>\
TK,) all are inf. ns. of غَلُظَ, (O,) or the last three,<br>\
the second and third of which are mentioned in<br>\
the Bári&#39;, on the authority of IAar, are simple<br>\
substs.; (Msb;) and perhaps غَلْظٌ may be an<br>\
inf. n. [of the latter verb]; (ISd, TA;) It (a<br>\
thing, Msb) was, or became, thick, gross, big,<br>\
bulky, or coarse; (Mgh, Msb, K;) it (a thing)<br>\
became غلِّيظ; as also ↓ استغلظ. (S.) You say,<br>\
غَلُظَ جِسْمُهُ His body was, or became, thick, &amp;c.<br>\
(Mgh.) And الزَّرْعُ ↓ استغلظ i. q. غَلُظَ, (Jel in<br>\
xlviii. 29,) The seed-produce became thick: (Bd:)<br>\
or strong: (Msb:) or well grown and thick: and<br>\
in like manner one says of any plant or tree:<br>\
(TA:) and غَلُظَتِ السُّنْبُلَةُ, and ↓ استغلظت, the<br>\
ear of corn produced grain. (K.) [And غَلْظَ<br>\
الثَّوْبُ The garment, or piece of cloth, was thick,<br>\
or coarse.] And غَلُظَتِ الأَرْضُ, inf. n. غِلَظٌ, and<br>\
perhaps غَلْظٌ may be also an inf. n. [of this verb,<br>\
or, more probably, of غَلَظَت], The land was, or<br>\
became, rough, or rugged. (ISd. TA.) [In this<br>\
sense, also, غَلُظَ is used in relation to various<br>\
things.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Said of a colour, It was dense, or<br>\
deep: see غَلِيظٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  He was, or became,<br>\
characterized by غِلْظَة, the contr. of رِقَّة, in<br>\

rude; unkind; hard; churlish; uncivil; surly;<br>\
hard to deal with; incompliant; unobsequious;<br>\
evil in disposition; illnatured; or the like (S,<br>\
by its explanation of غِلْظَةٌ and غِلَاظَةٌ; and<br>\
Msb: *) and in like manner, [as meaning it was,<br>\
or became, hard, or difficult, and the like, (see<br>\
غَلِيظٌ,)] it is said of an affair: (TA:) and ↓ تغلّظ<br>\
is said of a crime; meaning it was gross, or great;<br>\
but this is accord. to analogy only; not on the<br>\
authority of hearsay. (Mgh.) It is said in the<br>\
Kur [ix. 74, and lxvi. 9], واغْلُظْ عَلَيْهِمْ And use<br>\
thou roughness towards them: (Bd in lxvi. 9:)<br>\
and some read وَاغْلِظْ, with kesr to the ل. (TA.)<br>\

-b2-  and<br>\
also, and more commonly, in a tropical sense,<br>\
i. e., (tropical:)  hard, or difficult, and the like]: (TA:)<br>\
and غلّظ عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. as abuse, (tropical:)  [he made<br>\
the thing hard, or difficult, or the like, to him;]<br>\
and hence دِيَةٌ مَغَلَّظَةٌ, which see below. (S, TA,)<br>\
[Hence also,] غَلَّظْتُ اليَمِينَ, inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  I<br>\
made the oath strong, or forcible; I confirmed,<br>\
or ratified, it: (Msb;) [and so ↓ أَغْلَظْتُهَا; for you<br>\
say,] حَلَفَ بِإِغْلَاظِ اليَمِينِ (tropical:)  [He swore, making the<br>\

اغلظ الثَّوْبَ He found the garment, or piece<br>\
of cloth, to be thick, or coarse: (K:) or he bought<br>\
it thick, or coarse: (S, K:) the former is the<br>\
more correct: (O:) or the former only is correct.<br>\
(TS.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اغلظت اليَمِينَ: see 2.<br>\
-A2-  اغلظ [is also<br>\
intrans., and signifies] He (a man, Ibn-&#39;Abbád)<br>\

rugged, tract of land. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اغلظ<br>\
لَهُ فِى القَوْلِ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) (tropical:)  He was, or became, rough, harsh, coarse, rude, uncivil, or ungentle, to him in speech: (Mgh, Msb, K:) one<br>\

غَلْظٌ Rough, or rugged, land or ground; (ISd,<br>\
K;) mentioned on the authority of Ibn-&#39;Abbád;<br>\
and by AHn, on the authority of En-Nadr; but<br>\
it has been repudiated: and is said to be correctly<br>\
↓ غِلَظٌ: ISd says, of the former word, “I know<br>\
not whether it be [properly] syn. with غَلِيظٌ, or<br>\
whether it be an inf. n. used as an epithet: ”<br>\
accord. to Kr, it signifies hard land without<br>\
stones: Ks says that غَلْظٌ is syn. with ↓ غِلَظٌ.<br>\
