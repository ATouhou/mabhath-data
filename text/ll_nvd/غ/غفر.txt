IAmb allows it to be in the nom. case, on the<br>\
condition that هُم is understood [before it; i. e.,<br>\
the complete phrase being جَاؤُوا هُمُ الجَمَّآءُ الغَفِيرُ]:<br>\

the accus. case فِى التَّمَامِ [i. e. in the case of its<br>\
occurring after a proposition rendered complete<br>\
by the mention of the agent. as when you say<br>\
جَآءَ القَوْمُ الجَمَّآءَ الغَفِيرَ], and in the nom. case<br>\
فِى النُّقْصَانِ [i. e. in the case of its occurring<br>\

[They have not a disposition to excuse nor a disposition to forgive;] means they do not excuse nor<br>\
do they forgive a sin, a crime, or an offence, of<br>\
any one. (TA.) The rájiz (Sakhr-el-Ghei, L)<br>\
said, (on seeing his companions, with whom he<br>\
was journeying, fly from the Benu-l-Mustalik,<br>\
whom they chanced to meet, L,)<br>\
يَا قَوْمِ لَيْسَتْ فِيهِمُ غَفِيرَهْ<br>\
