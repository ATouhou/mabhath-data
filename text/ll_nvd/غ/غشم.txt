غَشِمَ, [accord. to the TK,<br>\

غَشِمَ, He smeared him [i. e. a camel] with tar<br>\
so that he left nothing [or no part of him] without<br>\
tar, pouring it upon what was sound thereof and<br>\

an inf. n., but accord. to the TK it is a simple<br>\
subst., and the inf. n. is غَشْمٌ,] signifies the act of<br>\
so smearing. (K.) ―<br>\

them] everything that he can get; as also ↓ غَشَّامٌ<br>\

غُشُومِيَّهٌ, meaning Ignorance of affairs, is a<br>\
word of the vulgar, like that next preceding.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
غَشَّامٌ: see غَشُومٌ.<br>\
غَاشِمٌ: see غَشُومٌ.<br>\

غشو and غشى<br>\
1<br>\
غَشِيَهُ, aor. يَغْشَى, inf. n. غَشَاوَةٌ, It covered,<br>\
or concealed, him, or it; (TA;) as also ↓ تغشّاهُ.<br>\
(MA.) And one says, غَشَانِى اللَّيْلُ, i. e. غَشِيَنِى<br>\
[The night covered me, or concealed me: or the<br>\
meaning may be that which next follows]. (JK.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  غَشِيَهُ, (K, TA,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,)<br>\
is said of an event (أَمْرٌ), [and of heat, (S and K<br>\
in art. دغم,) and of cold, (K in that art.,) and of<br>\
an affection of the mind or body, and of various<br>\
things, sometimes in like manner of a man, and<br>\
of a company of men,] in a similar sense; and so<br>\
↓ تغشّاهُ; (K, TA;) both signifying It came upon,<br>\
[or invaded, so as to surprise, and so as to over-whelm, properly meaning] as a thing that covered,<br>\
him, or it. (K, * TA.) Hence, in the Kur [liii.<br>\
16], إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَى [When there was<br>\
coming upon the lote-tree so as to cover it, or overspread it, what was so coming]. (TA.) And in<br>\
the same [xx. 81], فَغَشِيَهُمْ مِنَ الْيَمِّ مَا غَشِيَهُمْ [And<br>\
there came upon them so as to overwhelm them, of<br>\
the sea, what so came upon them]. (TA.) And<br>\
in the same [viii. 11], إِذْ يَغْشَاكُمُ [followed by<br>\
االنُّعَاسُ, i. e. When it (drowsiness) was coming<br>\
upon you, or overcoming you]; accord. to one<br>\
reading; other readings being يُغْشِيكُمُ and<br>\
يُغَشِّيكُمُ [followed by النُّعَاسَ]. (TA.) See also<br>\
غَاشِيَةٌ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b3-  [A somewhat similar<br>\
signification of غَشِيَهُ will be found below.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
One says of the night, يَغْشَى بِظُلْمَتِهِ كُلَّ مَا بَيْنَ<br>\
السَّمَآءِ وَالأَرْضِ [It covers, or conceals, with its<br>\
darkness, everything that is between the heaven<br>\
and the earth]. (Jel in xcii. 1.) And [hence it<br>\
is said that] غَشِىَ اللَّيْلُ means The night was, or<br>\
became, dark; as also ↓ اغشى. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
[And غَشِيَهُ, and غَشِىَ بَصَرَهُ and ↓ غشّاهُ, signify It,<br>\
i. e. light (ضَوْءٌ), came upon him, and upon his eye,<br>\
with an overpowering effect, so as to obscure, or<br>\
dazzle, his sight.] ―<br>\
-b6-  غَشِيَهُ also signifies جَآءَهُ (S)<br>\
or أَتَاهُ (Mgh, Msb, K) [which have two meanings, i. e. He came to him, and he did it; both,<br>\
perhaps, here meant, for both are well-known<br>\
meanings of غَشِيَهُ]; and, thus used, the aor. is as<br>\
above, (TA,) and the inf. n. is غَشَيَانٌ, (S, TA,)<br>\
or غِشْيَانٌ, (so in one of my copies of the S,) or the<br>\
subst. is ↓ غِشْيَانٌ, (Msb,) with kesr, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
syn. with إِتْيَانٌ. (Mgh.) You say, غَشِىَ فُلَانًا He<br>\
came to such a one; syn. أَتَاهُ; as also غَشَاهُ, aor.<br>\
يَغْشُوهُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence,] غَشِيَهَا, (S, MA, Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. غَشَيَانٌ or غِشْيَانٌ, (accord. to different<br>\
copies of the S,) or the latter and غَشْىٌ, (MA,)<br>\
or ↓ غِشْيَانٌ is the subst. in this case also, (Msb,)<br>\
and syn. with إِتْيَانٌ, metonymically used in the<br>\
sense of جِمَاعٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) (tropical:)  He compressed her;<br>\
(S, MA, Msb, K;) namely, a woman; (MA, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ تغشّاها. (MA, Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And غَشِىَ<br>\
إِلَيْهِ مَحْجَرًا He did to him (أَتَى إِلَيْهِ) a forbidden<br>\
action. (TA in art. حجر.) [Hence,] ↓ غِشْيَانُ<br>\
المَحَارِمِ [The doing of forbidden things]. (Mgh<br>\
and Msb and K in art. رهق.) And غَشِىَ الشَّىْءَ<br>\
He occupied himself with the thing, engaged in it,<br>\
or personally managed or conducted it; syn. لَابَسَهُ<br>\
and بَاشَرَهُ. (JM.) [And ↓ تغشّى has a similar<br>\
meaning; for it is said that] التَّغَشِّى and الغَشْىُ<br>\
primarily signify الإِتْيَانُ and المُلَابَسَةُ: and they<br>\
took an extended range in using the former, so<br>\
that one said, بِالعَدْلِ ↓ تَغَشَّاهُمْ or بِالْجَوْرِ [app.<br>\
meaning He ruled them with equity or with injustice]. (Ham p. 27.) [And one says, يَغْشَى<br>\
الحُرُوبَ (see Ham p. 27), meaning He plunges<br>\
into wars, or battles: see مُغَامِسٌ, and its verb.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b9-  One says also, غَشِيَهُ بِالسَّوْطِ, (K, in which it<br>\
is said to be like رَضِيَهُ, and so accord. to some<br>\
copies of the S, the phrase in these being غَشِيَتُ<br>\
الرَّجُلَ بِالسَّوْطِ,) or بِهِ ↓ غَشَّاهُ, (accord. to other<br>\
copies of the S, the verb in these being written<br>\
غَشَّيْتُ, and thus accord. to an explanation of قَنَّعَ<br>\
رَأْسَهُ بِالسَّوْطِ in art. قنع in the K,) He struck him<br>\
(i. e. a man, S) with the whip; he flogged him.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  غُشِىَ عَلَيْهِ, (S, MA, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. غَشْىٌ, (S, Mgh, * K,) or غُشْىٌ, (MA,) or<br>\
both, (Msb,) and غَشَيَانٌ, (K, TA, and so in some<br>\
copies of the S,) or غِشْيَانٌ, (so in other copies of<br>\
the S,) and ↓ غَشْيَةٌ, (S, Mgh,) or this last is an<br>\
inf. n. of un., (Msb,) or it is the subst., (K,) He<br>\
swooned, i. e. became senseless: (MA, PS:) or i. q.<br>\
أُغْمِىَ عَلَيْهِ [q. v.]: (K, TA:) or الغَشْىُ, or الغُشْىُ,<br>\
is a state of inertness (تَعَطُّل, Mgh, Msb) of the<br>\
motive and sensitive faculties, (Mgh,) or of the<br>\
motive faculties and of the sensitive will, (Msb,)<br>\
on account of the weakness of the heart, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) and the soul&#39;s becoming drawn together<br>\
thereto by a cause that suppresses it (يُخْفِيهِ)<br>\
within so that it finds not a place of passage, and<br>\
of the causes thereof is a strangling [or stifling], or<br>\
hurtful, cold repletion, or vehement hunger, (Mgh,)<br>\
or vehement pain, (Mgh, Msb,) or cold, or excessive hunger, (Msb,) or an evil affection in some<br>\
associate, or participating, organ, such as the<br>\
heart and the stomach: (Mgh:) some say that<br>\
it is the same as الإِغْمَآءُ [for which see its proper<br>\
art.]; (Mgh, Msb;) thus say the scholastic theologians: (Mgh:) others (the physicians and the<br>\
lawyers, Mgh) make a difference between these<br>\
two terms. (Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
2<br>\
غَشَّيْتُ الشَىْءَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. تَغْشِيَةٌ, (S,)<br>\
I covered the thing; put a cover, or covering,<br>\
upon it, or over it. (S, Msb.) One says, غَشَّى<br>\
اللّٰهُ عَلَى بَصَرِهِ, inf. n. as above; and ↓ اغشى; (K,<br>\
TA;) i. e. God put a covering upon, or over, his<br>\
eyes. (TA.) And hence, (TA,) it is said in the<br>\
Kur [xxxvi. 8], فَهُمْ لَا يُبْصِرُونَ ↓ فَأَغْشَيْنَاهُمْ And<br>\
we have put a covering over them [so that they<br>\
shall not see]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [See a usage of the<br>\
inf. n. voce شِينٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  غشّاهُ said of light; see 1,<br>\
former half. ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 4. ―<br>\
-b5-  غشّاهُ بِالسَّوْطِ: see<br>\
1, latter half. ―<br>\
-b6-  One says also, غَشَّيْتُهُ سَيْفًا, or<br>\
سَوْطًا, [in my original غشيته, without any syll.<br>\
sign, but app. as I have written, for I do not<br>\
find any instance of غَشِىَ as doubly trans., meaning I equipped him with a sword, or a whip,] like<br>\
the saying كَسَوْتُهُ سَيْفًا, or عَمَّمْتُهُ. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اغشاهُ إِيَّاهُ and ↓ غشّاهُ He made it to cover it;<br>\
or to be a cover, or covering, upon it, or over it.<br>\
(MA, * TK, and Bd * and Jel * in vii. 52, &amp;c.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,] both signify He made it, i. e. an<br>\
event (أَمْر), to come upon, [or invade, so as to<br>\
surprise, or so as to overwhelm, properly meaning]<br>\
as a thing that covered, him, or it. (K, * TA,)<br>\
Both of these verbs are used in this sense in the<br>\
Kur-án accord. to different readings in vii. 52 and<br>\
xiii. 3, and likewise (as mentioned in the first<br>\
paragraph of this art., q. v.,) in viii. 11. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also, the former, He made him, or it, to<br>\
come to him. (S, MA, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 2, in<br>\
two places. ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence,] اغشى اللَّيْلُ: see 1,<br>\
former half.<br>\

three places.<br>\

استغشى ثَوْبَهُ, (T, K, [agreeably with<br>\
phrases in the Kur xi. 6 and lxxi. 6,]) and (K)<br>\
بِثَوْبِهِ, (S, K,) and بِهِ ↓ تغشّى, (S,) [see an ex. of<br>\
the latter verb in a verse of El-Khansà cited in<br>\
the first paragraph of art. رعى, where it is trans.<br>\
without a preposition,] He covered himself with<br>\
his garment (S, K) in order that he might not see<br>\
nor hear: (K: [in the CK, يُسْمَعَ and يُرَى are<br>\

اِسْتَغْشَوْا ثِيَابَهُمْ means they put their garments as<br>\
a covering over their ears; and is a phrase denoting the refusing to hearken; or, as some say,<br>\
an allusion to running, like the phrase شَمَّرَ ذَيْلًا,<br>\
and أَلْقَى ثَوْبَهُ. (TA.)<br>\

the lote-tree called سِدْر; but sometimes the tree<br>\
thus called itself]: (K:) accord to the M, [the<br>\

signifies the same: (Msb;) [the pl. of the former<br>\
is أَغْشِيَةٌ and أَغْشَآءٌ; the former regular; and the<br>\
