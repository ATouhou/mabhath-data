غَرِقَ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
غَرَقَ, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. غَرَقٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,) He, or it,<br>\
(a thing, Msb,) sank, syn. غَارَ, (Mgh,) or رَسَبَ,<br>\
(TA,) فِى المَآءِ [in water, or in the water]: (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb:) primarily [he drowned; i. e. he<br>\
sank under water, and] the water entered the two<br>\
apertures of his nose so that it filled its passages<br>\
and he died. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] غَرِقَ فِى البِلَادِ,<br>\
inf. n. as above, * He (a man) went downwards<br>\
and disappeared (رَسَبَ) in the lands, or tracts of<br>\
land. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  غَرَقَ, (thus in the O,) or غَرِقَ,<br>\
like فَرِحَ, (thus accord. to the K,) He drank a<br>\
[draught such as is termed] غُرْقَة: (O, K:) so says<br>\
IAar. (O.) And غَرَقْتُ مِنَ اللَّبَنِ, (O, and thus<br>\
in copies of the K, in the CK غَرِقْتُ,) or غَرَقْتُ<br>\
مِنَ اللَّبَنِ غُرْقَةً, (TA,) I took a [draught such as<br>\
is termed] كُثْبَة of the milk: (O, K, TA:) so<br>\
says Ibn-&#39;Abbád. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And غَرِقَ He was,<br>\
or became, without want, or need. (IAar, O, K.)<br>\
-A4-  غَرْقًا used in the sense of إِغْرَاقًا, see under 4.<br>\
2<br>\
غَرَّقَ see 4, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence تَغْرِيقٌ became used to signify (tropical:)  Any killing: the origin of<br>\
its being thus used being the fact that the midwife<br>\
used to drown the new-born infant in the fluid of<br>\
the secundine in the year of drought, (S, O, K,<br>\
TA,) whether it were a male or female, (S, O,<br>\
TA,) so that it died: (S, O, K, TA:) or it is<br>\
from the phrase غَرَّقَتِ القَابِلَةُ الوَلَدَ meaning (tropical:)  The<br>\
midwife was ungentle with the child [at the birth]<br>\
so that the [fluid called] سَابِيَآء entered its nose and<br>\
killed it: or, accord. to the A, غَرَّقَتِ القَابِلَةُ المَوْلُودَ<br>\
means the midwife did not remove from out of the<br>\
nose of the new-born infant the mucus, so that it<br>\
entered into the air-passages of the nose and killed<br>\
it. (TA.) Hence the saying of Dhu-r-Rummeh,<br>\
إِذَا غَرَّقَتْ أَرْبَاضُهَا ثِنْىَ بَكْرَةٍ<br>\
بِتَيْهَآءَ لَمْ تُصْبِحْ رَؤُومًا سَلُوبُهَا<br>\
i. e. When her ropes [with which her saddle is<br>\
bound] kill a youthful she-camel&#39;s second young<br>\
one, [and she casts it in consequence, in a desert<br>\
in which one loses his way,] she [who is bereft of<br>\
it] does not become one that shows affection for<br>\
her offspring, by reason of the fatigue that has<br>\
come upon her: (S, O, TA:) for, as is said in<br>\
the T, where this verse is cited, when the saddle<br>\
is bound on the she-camel that has been ten<br>\
months pregnant, sometimes the fœtus becomes<br>\
drowned in the fluid of the سَابِيَآء, and she casts<br>\
it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  غُرِّقَ, said of a bridle, [and of the<br>\
scabbard of a sword, as also ↓ أُغْرِقَ, (see مُغَرَّقٌ,)]<br>\
signifies (tropical:)  It was ornamented, or was ornamented<br>\
in a general manner, with silver. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See,<br>\
again, 4.<br>\
-A2-  غرّق البَيْضَةَ He removed the غِرْقِئ<br>\
[q. v.] of the egg. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
غَارَقَنِى كَذَا (tropical:)  Such a thing was, or became,<br>\
near to me; drew near to me; or approached me.<br>\
(TA.) And غَارَقَتْهُ المَنِيَّةُ (tropical:)  [Death became near<br>\
to him]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And غَارَقَتِ الوَقْعَةُ (tropical:)  The<br>\
onslaught was, or became, obligatory. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اغرقهُ, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. أِغْرَاقٌ;<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ غرّقهُ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. تَغْرِيقٌ;<br>\
(TA;) [primarily, He drowned him: (see 1, first<br>\
sentence:) generally expl. as meaning] he sank<br>\
him, or it, (TA, [see again 1, first sentence,])<br>\
فِى المَآءِ [in water, or in the water] (S, * O,<br>\
Msb, * K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اغرق أَعْمَالَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
annulled his [good] works, by the commission of<br>\
acts of disobedience. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اغرقهُ النَّاسُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The people multiplied against him and overcame<br>\
him: and in like manner, أَغْرَقَتْهُ السِّبَاعُ (assumed tropical:)  [The<br>\
beasts of prey multiplied against him &amp;c.] so<br>\
says IAar. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The saying of Lebeed,<br>\
describing a horse.<br>\
يُغْرِقُ الثَّعْلَبَ فِى شِرَّتِهِ<br>\
is said to mean (assumed tropical:)  He outstrips the ثَعْلَب [i. e. the<br>\
fox] in his sprightliness, and leaves him behind:<br>\
[see also 8:] or he causes the part of the spearshaft that enters into its iron head to disappear in<br>\
him who is pierced therewith by reason of the<br>\
vehemence of his running. (O, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b5-  اغرق<br>\
الكَأْسَ means (tropical:)  He filled the كأس [or wine-cup].<br>\
(O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See also 2, near the end. ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
اغرق فِى القَوْسِ [السَّهْمَ being understood] (tropical:)  He<br>\
(the drawer of the bow, i. e., of the string of the<br>\
bow with the arrow, S, O, K, TA, or the shooter,<br>\
Msb) drew the bow to the fall: (S, O, Msb, K:)<br>\
accord. to ISh, الاغراق signifies the sending the<br>\
arrow far by vehement drawing [of the bow]:<br>\
accord. to Useyd El-Ghanawee, the drawing of<br>\
the bow so that it brings the sinews that are<br>\
wound upon the socket of the arrow, as far as<br>\
the iron head, to the part that is grasped by the<br>\
hand; which is termed شُرْبُ القَوْسِ الرِّصَافَ; and<br>\
one says of him who does so, يَنْزِعُ حَتَّى يَشْرَبَ<br>\
بِالرِّصَافِ: (TA:) ↓ غرّق, also, signifies the same,<br>\
(O, K,) inf. n. تَغْرِيقٌ: (O:) and one says, غرّق<br>\
النَّبْلَ, meaning he drew the bow with the arrows<br>\
to the utmost extent. (TA.) In the saying in the<br>\
Kur [lxxix. 1], ↓ وَالنَّازِعَاتِ غَرْقًا, the last word is<br>\
put in the place of the proper inf. n. of أَغْرَقَ, for<br>\
إِغْرَاقًا; (Fr, * Az, O, K; *) the meaning being<br>\
By those angels that pull forth the souls of the<br>\
unbelievers from their bosoms with a vehement<br>\
pulling. (Fr, O.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Hence, i. e. from اغرق السَّهْمَ<br>\
[or اغرق فِى القَوْسِ], one says, اغرق فِى القَوْلِ,<br>\
(TA,) or فِى الشَّىْءِ, (Msb,) (tropical:)  He exceeded the<br>\
usual bounds, degree, or mode; exerted himself<br>\
much, beyond measure, or to the utmost; or was<br>\
extravagant, or immoderate; (Msb, TA;) in the<br>\
saying, (TA,) or in the thing. (Msb.) [See<br>\
also 10.]<br>\
8<br>\
اغترق الخَيْلَ (tropical:)  He (a horse) mixed among<br>\
the [other] horses, and then outstripped them, or<br>\
outwent them. (S, O, K, TA.) And اغترق حَلْبَةَ<br>\
الخَيْلِ (tropical:)  He (a horse) outstripped, or outwent, the<br>\
collection of horses started together for a wager<br>\
that were preceding. (AO, TA.) And [hence]<br>\
one says, خَاصَمَنِى فَاغْتَرَقْتُ حَلْبَتَهُ, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [He contended with me in an altercation, or he<br>\
disputed, or litigated, with me, and] I overcame<br>\
him in the altercation, &amp;c. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اغترق<br>\
التَّصْدِيرَ, (O, K, TA,) or البَطَانَ, (O, TA,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
(a camel), his belly being large, (O, K, TA,) and<br>\
his sides being swollen, (O, TA,) took up the whole<br>\
of the breast-girth, (O, K, TA,) or the belly-girth,<br>\
(O, TA,) so that it was too strait for him; as<br>\
also ↓ استغرقهُ. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اغترق النَّفَسَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He took in the whole of the breath in drawing<br>\
it in, or back, with vehemence. (S, O, TA.)<br>\
Accord. to the copies of the K, اغترقت الَّفْسُ,<br>\
meaning اِسْتَوْعَبَت: but this is a mistake: the<br>\
correct phrase is اغترق النَّفَسَ, the latter word<br>\
مُحَرَّكَة [and in the accus. case]; and the explanation, اِسْتَوْعَبَهُ فِى الزَّفِيرِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And تَغْتَرِقُ<br>\
نَظَرَهُمْ, said of a woman, (tropical:)  [She engrosses their<br>\
look; i. e.] she occupies them in looking at her so<br>\
as to divert them from looking at other than her,<br>\
by reason of her beauty: (O, K, TA:) and in like<br>\
manner one says, تغترق الطَّرْفَ (tropical:)  [she engrosses the<br>\
look]. (O, TA.) [See also what next follows.]<br>\
10<br>\
استغرق (tropical:)  He, or it, took, took in or comprised or comprehended or included, or took up or<br>\
occupied, altogether, wholly, or universally; took<br>\
in the gross; engrossed; syn. اِسْتَوْعَبَ. (S, O, K,<br>\
TA.) Hence the phrase of the grammarians, لَا<br>\
لِاسْتِغْرَاقِ الجِنْسِ (tropical:)  [لا denoting the universal inclusion of the genus]. (TA.) [Hence also several<br>\
other conventional usages of the word]. See<br>\
also 8 [with which it is interchangeable in several<br>\
cases]. ―<br>\
-b2-  اِسْتَغْرَقَ فِى الضَّحِكِ is like, (O, TA,) or<br>\
syn. with, (K,) اِسْتَغْرَبَ (tropical:)  [He exceeded the usual<br>\
bounds, or degree, in laughing; was immoderate<br>\
in laughing]. (O, K, TA.) [And in the same<br>\
sense the verb is used in other cases. See also 4,<br>\
last signification.]<br>\
12<br>\
اِغْرَوْرَقَتْ عَيْنَاهُ His eyes shed tears (S, O,<br>\
K, TA) as though they were drowned therein:<br>\
(O, K, TA:) or اِغْرَوْرَقَتْ عَيْنَاهُ بِالدُّمُوعِ his eyes<br>\
filled with tears but did not overflow. (ISk, Az,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
Q. Q. 1<br>\
غَرْقَأَتْ, as said of a hen, mentioned in<br>\
this art. in the K (as being Q. Q.) and also in the<br>\
TA as said of an egg, see in art. غرقأ.<br>\
غَرِقٌ and ↓ غَارِقٌ and ↓ غَرِيقٌ part. ns. of غَرِقَ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K,) the first and second signifying<br>\
[Drowning; or] sinking in water without dying;<br>\
(S, * Msb;) and the third, [drowned; or] dead by<br>\
sinking in water; (Kh, Msb;) i. q. مُغْرَقٌ or مُغَرَّقٌ;<br>\
(so in different copies of the S;) and accord. to<br>\
the Bari&#39;, the third may have both meanings<br>\
agreeably with analogy; (Msb;) [see an instance<br>\
of its usage in the former sense voce تَغَمْغَمَ; and<br>\
the first is sometimes used in the latter sense;<br>\
for] it is said in a trad. that the غَرِق is of those<br>\
who are [reckoned as] شُهَدَآء [or martyrs: see<br>\
شَهِيدٌ]; (O, TA;) though it is said that غَرِقٌ signifies sinking in water [like as does غَارِقٌ]; and<br>\
غَرِيقٌ, dead therein; or, accord. to Aboo-&#39;Adnán<br>\
غَرِقٌ signifies overcome by the water but not<br>\
having yet sunk; and غَرِيقٌ, having sunk [therein]:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. of غَرِيقٌ is غَرْقَى. (Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in a trad., يَأْتِى عَلَى النَّاسِ زَمَانٌ<br>\
لَا يَنْجُو فِيهِ أَحَدٌ إِلَّا مَنْ دَعَا دُعَآءَ الغَرِقِ [A time will<br>\
come upon men in which no one will become safe<br>\
but he who prays with the praying of the drowning]; app. meaning, but he who is sincere in<br>\
praying, as is he who is on the brink of destruction. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And مَاتَ غَرِقًا فِى الخَمْرِ, in<br>\
another trad., means (tropical:)  He died going to the<br>\
utmost point, or degree, in the drinking of wine.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  أَرْضٌ غَرِقَةٌ means Land in the utmost<br>\
state of irrigation. (IF, A, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  غَرِقٌ and<br>\
↓ غَرِيقٌ also signify (tropical:)  A man much [or deeply] in<br>\
debt: and overwhelmed by trials. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And<br>\
one says, إِنَّهُ لَغَرِقُ الصَّوْتِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Verily he is<br>\
frightened so that his voice is stopped short. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
غُرْقَةٌ A single draught (شَرْبَة [in the CK شُرْبَة])<br>\
of milk, &amp;c.: (A &#39;Obeyd, S, O, K:) or a small<br>\
quantity of milk, and of beverage, or peculiarly<br>\
of the former: (TA in art. عرق:) pl. غُرَقٌ.<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S, O, K.)<br>\
غِرْقِئٌ: see art. غرقأ: its hemzeh is augmentative (O, K) accord. to Fr: (O, TA:) and Aboo-Is-hák [i. e. Zj] held it to be so: (IJ, MF, TA:)<br>\
but in the opinion of MF, there is no probable<br>\
reason for this, either on the ground of analogy<br>\
or of derivation. (TA.)<br>\
غَرِيقٌ: see غَرِقٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says<br>\
also, أَنَا غَرِيقُ أَيَادِيكَ, meaning (tropical:)  [I am the<br>\
drowned in the flood] of thy favours. (TA.)<br>\
غِرْيَاقٌ A certain bird: (IDrd, O, K:) so they<br>\
assert: but it is not of established authority.<br>\
(IDrd, O.)<br>\
غَارِقٌ: see غَرِقٌ, first sentence.<br>\
غَارِيقُونٌ, (Mgh, K,) or أَغَارِيقُونٌ, (K,) an<br>\
ancient Greek word, [a&gt;gariko\n,] (TA,) A certain medicine; a thing [or substance] resembling<br>\
أَنْجُذَان; [see حِلْتِيتٌ;] male and female; in the<br>\
bitterness of which is a sweetness: (Mgh:) or the<br>\
root, or stem, (أَصْل,) of a certain plant: or a<br>\
certain thing [or substance] which originates in<br>\
worm-eaten trees; an antidote to poisons, (K,<br>\
TA,) an attenuant of turbid humour, exhilarant,<br>\
(K, * TA,) and good for sciatica; and [it is said<br>\
that] he upon whom it is suspended will not be<br>\
stung by a scorpion. (K, TA.)<br>\
مُغْرَقٌ: see مُغَرَّقٌ.<br>\
مُغْرق, [as though مُغَرِقٌ, but I think it more<br>\
probable that it is correctly ↓ مُغَرِّقٌ,] applied to a<br>\
she-camel, That casts her young one, in a perfect<br>\
state or otherwise, and will not be made to incline<br>\
to it, or to affect it, nor will be milked; not such<br>\
as yields her milk copiously, nor [such as is termed]<br>\
خَلِفَة [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
مُغَرَّقٌ, applied to a bridle, (tropical:)  Ornamented, (S,<br>\
O, K,) or ornamented in a general manner, (TA,)<br>\

and likewise applied to the scabbard of a sword.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

رَمَضَانُ مُغَارِقٌ [The observance of Ramadán is<br>\
obligatory]. (TA.)<br>\
