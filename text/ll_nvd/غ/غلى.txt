غَلَّايَةٌ A vessel of copper [or brass], in which<br>\
water is heated; thus called by the people of<br>\
Syria; the same that is called مِحَمٌّ [q. v.] and<br>\

perfumes; (Msb;) musk mixed or boiled [with<br>\
other perfumes]; (MA;) or a perfume composed<br>\
of musk and ambergris and camphor and oil of<br>\
ben: (KL:) it is said that the first who called it<br>\
thus was Suleymán Ibn-&#39;Abd-El-Melik; (S, TA;)<br>\
and he did so because it is a compound boiled<br>\
together upon the fire: or it was thus named by<br>\
Mo&#39;áwiyeh; the case being, that &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Jaafar went in to him, and the odour of perfume<br>\
was diffusing itself from him; so he said, “What<br>\
is thy perfume, O &#39;Abd-Allah? ” and he answered,<br>\
“ musk and ambergris combined with oil of ben; ”<br>\
whereupon Mo&#39;áwiyeh said, غَالِيَةٌ, meaning highpriced: (TA:) [hence some hold the word to<br>\
belong to art. غلو; and their opinion is strengthened by the fact that] غَلْوَى signifies the same.<br>\
