غَبَطَهُ aor.<br>\
غَبِطَ, (S, K,) inf. n. غَبْطٌ, (S,) He<br>\
felt with his hand his (a ram&#39;s) أَلْيَة [i. e. rump,<br>\
or tail, or fat of the tail,] in order to see if he<br>\
were fat or not: (S, K:) and he felt it (his back)<br>\
with his hand in order to know whether he were<br>\
lean or fat: (Lth, K: *) and in like manner the<br>\
verb is used in relation to a she-camel. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  غَبَطَهُ, aor.<br>\
غَبِطَ; (ISk, Az, S, Msb, K;) and<br>\
غَبِطَهُ, aor.<br>\
غَبَطَ; (Ibn-Buzurj, Sgh, K;) inf. n. غَبْطٌ<br>\
(ISk, Az, S, Msb, K) and غِبْطَةٌ, (S, K,) or the<br>\
latter is a simple subst.; (Msb;) He regarded<br>\
him [with unenvious emulation, i. e.] with a wish<br>\
for the like of his condition, (ISk, Az, S,) meaning a good condition, (Az,) or for the like of that<br>\
which he had attained, (Msb,) or for a blessing,<br>\
(K,) and that it might not pass away, (ISk, K,)<br>\
or without desiring that it should pass away, (Az,<br>\
S, Msb,) from the latter person: (ISk, Az, S,<br>\
Msb, K:) the doing so is not حَسَدٌ, (Az, S, Msb,)<br>\
for this implies the desire that what is wished for<br>\
may pass away from its possessor; (Az, Msb;)<br>\
or it is a kind of حَسَد, of a more moderate<br>\
quality: (Az:) or غِبْطَةٌ and غَبْطٌ have the signification shown above, and are also syn. with<br>\
حَسَدٌ; (K;) this latter meaning is assigned to<br>\
غَبْطٌ by IAar; and it is said that the Arabs use<br>\
غَبْطٌ in the sense of حَسَدٌ metonymically; (TA;)<br>\
[so that غَبَطَهُ and غَبِطَهُ may also mean (tropical:)  he envied him; &amp;c.; see an ex. in a prov. cited voce<br>\
بَطْنٌ; but it is said that] حَسَدٌ, when it is for<br>\
courage and the like, is syn. with غِبْطَةٌ, and then<br>\
it implies admiration, without a wish that the<br>\
thing admired may pass away from its possessor.<br>\
(Msb in art. حسد.) You say, غَبَطَهُ بِهِ, (S,) and<br>\
عَلَيْهِ, (IAth,) and فِيهِ, (Msb,) He regarded him<br>\
with a wish for the like of it, meaning a thing or<br>\
state which he had attained, without desiring that<br>\
it should pass away from the latter person. (S,<br>\
IAth, * Msb.) Mohammad was asked, “Does<br>\
الغَبْط injure? ” and he answered, “Yes, like as<br>\
الخَبْط injures: ” or, accord. to the relation of<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd, “No, save as الخَبْط injures the [trees<br>\
called] عِضَاه: ” (Az, TA:) [see خَبَطَ:] by الغيط<br>\
meaning, accord. to some, الحَسَد: (TA:) or a<br>\
kind thereof, of a more moderate quality; injurious, but not so injurious as الحسد whereby<br>\
one wishes that a blessing may pass away from<br>\
his brother; الخبط meaning the beating off the<br>\
leaves of trees; after which they become replaced,<br>\
without there resulting any injury therefrom to<br>\
the stock and branches: moreover, الغبط sometimes occasions the smiting of its object with the<br>\
evil eye. (Az, TA.) [See also غِبْطَةٌ, below.]<br>\
-A3-<br>\
Accord. to IKtt, غَبَطَ signifies also He lied;<br>\
but perhaps it is a mistranscription for عَبَطَ, which<br>\
has this meaning; for it is not mentioned by any<br>\
other. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
غَبَّطَ It is said in a trad., جَآءَ وَهُمْ يُصَلُّونَ فَيَجْعَلَ<br>\
يُغَبِّطُهُمْ; thus it is related, meaning, [He came<br>\
to them while they were praying, and he began] to<br>\
incite them to wish for the like of that action: if<br>\
related without teshdeed, [يَغْبِطُهُمْ,] the meaning<br>\
is, to regard them with a wish for the like condition, because of their forwardness to prayer.<br>\
(Nh, K.)<br>\

-A2-  اغبط الرَّحْلَ عَلَى ظَهْرِ البَعِيرِ, (S,)<br>\
or على الدَّابَّةِ, (K,) He kept the saddle constantly<br>\
(S, K) upon the back of the camel, (S,) or upon<br>\
the beast, (K,) not putting it down from him.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  إِغْبَاطٌ also signifies The continuing constantly riding. (ISk.) And أَغْبَطُوا عَلَى رِكَابِهِمْ<br>\
فِى السَّيْرِ They kept the saddles on their travellingcamels night and day, not putting them down, in<br>\
journeying. (ISh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence, (A, TA,) أَغْبَطَتْ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ الحُمَّى (tropical:)  The fever continued upon him; (S,<br>\
K, TA;) as though it set the غَبِيط upon him, to<br>\
ride him; like as you say, رَكِبَتْهُ الحُمَّى, and<br>\
اِمْتَطَتْهُ, and اِرْتَحَلَتْهُ: (A, TA:) or clave to him:<br>\
(TA:) or did not quit him for some days; as also<br>\
أَغْمَطَتْ, and أَرْدَمَتْ. (As.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And أَغْبَطَتِ السَّمَآءُ<br>\

(Aboo-Kheyreh.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And أَغْبَطَ النَّبَاتُ (tropical:)  The<br>\
herbage covered the land, and became dense, as<br>\
though it were from a single grain. (K, TA.)<br>\

which one would be regarded with unenvious emulation, i. e., with a wish to be in the like condition,<br>\
without its being desired that it should pass away<br>\

-A2-  The saying,<br>\
خَوَّى قَلِيلًا غَيْرَ مَا اغْتِبَاطِ<br>\
cited by Th, but not expl. by him, is held by ISd<br>\
to mean [He (referring to a camel) lay down, or<br>\
did so making his belly to be separated somewhat<br>\
from the ground], not resting upon a wide غَبِيط<br>\
[q. v.] of ground, but upon a place not even, and<br>\

extremities of the two skins [whereof the مزادة is<br>\
mainly composed] and then strongly sewed. (Ibn-<br>\
