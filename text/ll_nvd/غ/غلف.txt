signifies, (Msb,) or signifies also, (S,) he furnished<br>\
it with a غِلَاف; (S, Msb;) or ↓ غلّف signifies<br>\
thus: (TA:) القَارُورَةَ ↓ أَغْلَفْتُ is said by Lth to<br>\
be from الغِلَافُ; and so ↓ غَلَّفْتُهَا, inf. n. تَغْلِيفٌ.<br>\

(Mgh, TA,) and likewise with other perfume,<br>\
and with حِنَّآء; (TA;) and ↓ غَلَّفَهَا: (Mgh, TA:)<br>\
but accord. to IDrd, the vulgar say so: (O, Msb,<br>\
TA:) he says that the correct phrase is غَلَّاهَا<br>\
(Mgh, O, Msb, TA) بالغالية, (O,) and غَلَّلَهَا:<br>\
(Mgh, O, Msb:) in a trad. of &#39;Aacute;ïsheh, however,<br>\
لِحْيَةَ رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ ↓ كُنْتُ أُغَلِّفُ occurs as meaning I<br>\
used to daub, or smear, the beard of the Apostle of<br>\
God with غالية, doing so abundantly: (TA:) and<br>\

[in like manner,] ↓ اغتلف (Lth, O, TA) مِنَ<br>\
الغَالِيَةِ (Lth, O) or مِنَ الطِّيبِ: (TA:) but accord.<br>\
to the saying of IDrd [mentioned above], these<br>\
are wrong, and should be only تَغَلَّى and تَغَلَّلَ,<br>\
and اِغْتَلَى and اِغْتَلَّ: (O:) or, accord. to Ibn-El-Faraj, one says بالغالية ↓ تغلّف when it is<br>\
