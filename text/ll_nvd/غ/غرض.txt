غَرِضَ, aor.<br>\
غَرَضَ, (S, K,) inf. n. غَرَضٌ, (S, A,<br>\
K,) He was vexed, or disquieted by grief, and by<br>\
distress of mind; he was grieved, and distressed in<br>\
mind: he was disgusted; he turned away with<br>\
disgust. (S, A, K.) You say, غَرِضَ مِنْهُ He was<br>\
vexed by, or at, him, or it, and disquieted by grief,<br>\
and by distress of mind; he was grieved, and distressed in mind, by him, or it: (Mgh in art. غرض,<br>\
and TA:) he was disgusted with it, or at it; he<br>\
turned away from it with disgust: (Mgh:) and<br>\
he feared him, or it. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K, TK: but the<br>\
first and second mention only the inf. n. of the<br>\
verb in this last sense.) And غَرِضَ بِالمُقَامِ, aor.<br>\
and inf. n. as above, [He was vexed, &amp;c., by continuance, stay, residence, or abode, in a place: he<br>\
was disgusted with it, or at it.] (S.) And إِذَا<br>\
فَاتَهُ الغَرَضُ فَتَّهُ الغَرَضُ i. e. الضَّجَرُ [When the<br>\
object of aim, or endeavour, escapes him, so that<br>\
he cannot attain it, vexation, or disquietude by<br>\
grief, and by distress of mind, or disgust, crushes<br>\
him]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (A,) aor. as<br>\
above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (A, TA,) He<br>\
yearned, or longed: (S, A, K:) or he yearned,<br>\
or longed, vehemently, or intensely: (TA:) إِلَيْهِ<br>\
for him, or it: (S:) or إِلَى لِقَائِهِ for meeting<br>\
with him: the verb in this sense being made<br>\
trans. by means of الى because it imports the<br>\
meaning of اِشْتَاقَ and حَنَّ [which are made<br>\
trans. by the same means]: (A, TA:) [for]<br>\
accord. to Akh, غَرِضْتُ إِلَيْهِ signifies غَرِضْتُ مِنْ<br>\
هٰؤُلآءِ إِلَيْهِ [I turned with vexation, or disgust,<br>\
from these, to him, or it]; because the Arabs<br>\
connect the verb [with its objective complement]<br>\
by means of all these particles [mentioned above;<br>\
namely, ب and من and الى]. (S.) Mbr reckons<br>\
غَرَضٌ, as meaning both “ being disgusted ” and<br>\
“ yearning ” or “ longing,” among words having<br>\
contrary significations; and so does Ibn-Es-Seed;<br>\
(MF;) and in like manner, IKtt. (TA.) [Perhaps these derive the latter meaning from غَرَضٌ<br>\
signifying “ a butt,” or “ an object of aim,” &amp;c.]<br>\
-A2-  غَرَضَ عَنْهُ, (TA,) [in the TK غَرَضَهُ,] inf. n.<br>\
غَرْضٌ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K,) He (a man, TA) refrained, forbore, abstained, or desisted, from him,<br>\
or it; left, relinquished, or forsook, him, or it.<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, * K, * TA.)<br>\
-A3-  غَرُضَ, aor.<br>\
غَرُضَ, inf. n.<br>\
غِرَضٌ, It (a thing) was fresh, juicy, moist, not<br>\
flaccid. (S, K.)<br>\
-A4-  غَرَضَ الشَّىْءَ, aor.<br>\
غَرِضَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. غَرْضٌ; (TA;) and ↓ غرّضهُ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَغْرِيضٌ; (TA;) He plucked the thing while it<br>\
was fresh, juicy, moist, or not flaccid: or he took<br>\
it (أَخَذَهُ, in some copies of the K جَذَّهُ, which is<br>\
a mistake, TA) while it was so. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
did the thing hastily, or hurriedly, before its time;<br>\
syn. أَعْجَلَهُ عَنْ وَقْتِهِ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, TS, K. *)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  غَرَضَ السَّخْلَ, (S, K,) aor. and inf. n. as<br>\
above; (TA;) and ↓ غرّضها; (K;) (assumed tropical:)  He weaned<br>\
the lambs, or kids, before their time. (ISk, S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  غَرَضَتْ سِقَآءَهَا, (S, K,) aor. and inf. n. as<br>\
above, (S,) (assumed tropical:)  She (a woman, S) churned, or<br>\
agitated, the contents of her milk-skin, and when<br>\
its butter had formed in little clots but had not<br>\
collected together, she poured out the milk, and<br>\
gave it to people to drink. (ISk, S, K. *) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
غَرَضْتُ لَهُ غَرِيضًا (tropical:)  I gave him to drink fresh milk.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  غَرَضْتُ لِلضَّيْفِ غَرِيضًا (tropical:)  I fed the guests<br>\
with food that had not been kept through the<br>\
night: so in the A: but in the K, لَهُمْ ↓ أَغْرَضَ<br>\
غَرِيضًا (tropical:)  he kneaded for them fresh dough, and did<br>\
not feed them with food that had been kept<br>\
through the night. (TA.)<br>\
-A5-  غَرَضَهُ, aor.<br>\
غَرِضَ, [inf. n.<br>\
غَرْضٌ,] also signifies He filled it, namely, a<br>\
vessel, (S, K,) and a skin, and a wateringtrough; (TA;) and so ↓ اغرضهُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
He stopped short of filling it completely. (S, K.<br>\
[See also 2.]) Thus it has two contr. significations. (S, K.) A rájiz says,<br>\
لَقَدْ فَدَى أَعْنَاقَهُنَّ المَحْضُ<br>\
وَالدَّأْظُ حَتَّى مَا لَهُنَّ غَرْضُ<br>\
(S, TA,) i. e. Verily the محض and the دأظ [the<br>\
pure milk and the fatness and fulness so that there<br>\
is no deficiency in their skins] have ransomed them<br>\
from being slaughtered and sold. (TA.) [But see<br>\
غَرْضٌ below.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, aor.<br>\
غَرِضَ, inf. n. غَرْضٌ, He<br>\
broke it (i. e. a thing) without separating it. (TA.)<br>\
-A6-  غَرَضَ البَعِيرَ, (S,) or النَّاقَةَ, (K,) [aor.<br>\
غَرِضَ, as<br>\
appears from the word مَغْرِضٌ, for otherwise, by<br>\
rule, it would be مَغْرَضٌ,] inf. n. غَرْضٌ, (K,) He<br>\
bound the غَرْض upon the camel; (S;) as also<br>\
↓ اغْتِرضهُ; (TA;) or he bound the she-camel with<br>\
the غُرْضَة, (K,) or غَرْض; (TA;) as also ↓ أَغْرَضَهَا;<br>\
(K;) and in like manner, غَرَضَ البَغِيرَ بِالغَرْضِ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
غرّض, inf. n. تَغْرِيضٌ, He ate fresh flesh-meat. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also غَرَضَ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
One says also, غَرِّضْ فِى سِقَائَكَ Fill not thy skin<br>\
[completely; leave a portion unfilled in thy skin].<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فُلَانٌ بَحْرٌ لَا يُغَرَّضُ i. e. [Such a one<br>\
is a sea] that will not become exhausted. (S, A, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And غرّض signifies also تَفَكَّهَ, (K, TA.)<br>\
[meaning He affected jesting, or joking, for it<br>\
is] said in the I. to be from الفُكَاهَةُ signifying<br>\
المُزَاحُ. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
غارض إِبِلَهُ (tropical:)  He brought his camels to the<br>\
watering-place early in the morning; in the first<br>\
part of the day. (A, O, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اغرضهُ He made him to be vexed, or disquieted<br>\
by grief, and by distress of mind; to be grieved,<br>\
and distressed in mind: he made him to be disgusted; to turn away with disgust. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also 1, latter half, in two places.<br>\
-A3-  اغرض النَّاقَةَ:<br>\
see 1, last sentence.<br>\
-A4-  اغرض He (a man) hit, or<br>\
attained, the غَرَض [i. e. the butt, or object of aim,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (IKtt.)<br>\
5<br>\
تغرّض, (K, TA,) thus in the O, on the<br>\
authority of Ibn-&#39;Abbád; but accord. to the Tekmileh, ↓ انغرض; (TA;) said of a branch, It broke<br>\
without breaking in pieces: (K, TA:) or, accord.<br>\
to the L, the latter signifies It bent and broke<br>\
without becoming separated. (TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْغَرَضَ see what next precedes.<br>\
8<br>\
اِغْتَرَضَ: (so in a copy of the A: [and if this<br>\
be correct, the primary signification seems to be<br>\
It (a thing) was plucked, or taken, while it was<br>\
fresh, juicy, moist, or not flaccid: quasi-pass. of<br>\
غَرَضَ in the first of the senses assigned to it as a<br>\
trans. v. above:]) or اُغْتَرِضَ: (so in the JK and<br>\
TA: [and if this be correct, it is app. formed<br>\
by transposition from اُغْتُضِرَ:]) (tropical:)  He died in his<br>\
fresh state; (JK;) [i. e.] he died a youth, or<br>\
a young man: [the latter reading seems to be<br>\
the right, for it is said to be] similar to اُحْتُضِرَ<br>\
[evidently a mistranscription for اُخْتُضِرَ]. (A,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اغترض الشَّىْءَ He made the thing his<br>\
غَرَض [i. e. butt, or object of aim, &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  اغترض البَعِيرَ: see 1, last sentence.<br>\
غَرْضٌ and ↓ غُرْضَةٌ The appertenance of a camel&#39;s<br>\
saddle of the kind called رَحْل which is like the حِزَام<br>\
of the سَرْج (S, K) and the بِطَان of the قَتَب; (S;)<br>\
i. e. girth, or fore girth, (تَصْدِير,) thereof; (S;)<br>\

أَغْرَاضٌ [a pl. of pauc.] (S, K) and أَغْرُضٌ [also a<br>\
pl. of pauc.] (IB) and غُرُوضٌ [a pl. of mult.]:<br>\
and of the latter, ↓ غُرْضٌ, [or rather this is a coll.<br>\
gen. n.,] (S, K,) like as بُسْرٌ is of بُسْرَةٌ, (S,) and<br>\
غُرُضٌ. (S, K.) [Hence the saying of Mohammad,] غُرْض shall not be bound [upon camels by<br>\
pilgrims] except to three mosques; the sacred<br>\
mosque [of Mekkeh], and my mosque [of ElMedeeneh], and the mosque [El-Aksà] of Beytel-Makdis [or Jerusalem]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  غَرْضٌ also<br>\
signifies (accord. to some, in the verse cited in<br>\
the first paragraph, S, TA) The place of what<br>\
thou hast left (مَوْضِعُ مَا تَرَكْتَهُ, not ماء [i. e. not<br>\
مَآءٍ] as written in the S [and K], TA,) and not<br>\
put into it anything: (S, K, TA:) and is said<br>\
by some to be like the أَمْت [q. v.] in a skin.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A state of folding. (AHeyth,<br>\
K.) And A man&#39;s having folds (غُرُوض) in the<br>\
body when he has been fat and then has become lean.<br>\
(Sgh, K.) And you say, طَوَيْتُ الثَّوْبَ عَلَى غُرُوضِهِ<br>\
i. e. غُرُورِهِ [I folded the garment, or piece of cloth,<br>\
according to its first, or original, foldings.] (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, Z, Sgh, K.)<br>\
عُرْضٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
غَرَضٌ A butt, a mark, or an object of aim, at<br>\
which one shoots, or throws; (S, O, Msb, K;) a<br>\
thing that thou settest up (مَا أَمْثَلْتَهُ) to shoot or<br>\
throw at: (IDrd:) pl. أَغْرَاضٌ. (Msb, K.) It is<br>\
said in a trad., لَا تَتَّخِذُوا شَيْئًا فِيهِ الرَّوحُ غَرَضًا [Ye<br>\
shall not take a thing in which is the vital principle as a butt]. (TA.) And hence one says,<br>\
النَّاسُ أَغْرَاضُ المَنِيَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  [Mea are the butts of destiny,<br>\
or of death]: and جَعَلْتَنِى غَرَضًا لِشَتْمِكَ (assumed tropical:)  [Thou<br>\
madest me, or hast made me, a butt for thy reviling]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (tropical:)  An object of aim<br>\
or endeavour or pursuit, of desire or wish, or of<br>\
intention or purpose: (Msb:) a scope; or any<br>\
end which one endeavours, or seeks, or intends, or<br>\
purposes, to attain: (B:) an object of want, and<br>\
of desire: (TA:) the advantage, or good, which<br>\
one seeks, or endeavours, or purposes, to attain, or<br>\
obtain, from a thing: so much used in this tropical sense as to be, in this sense, conventionally<br>\
regarded as proper. (MF.) You say, غَرَضُهُ كَذَا<br>\
(tropical:)  His object of aim or endeavour or pursuit, &amp;c.,<br>\
is such a thing: (Msb:) or his object of want,<br>\
and of desire, is such a thing (TA.) And فَعَلَ<br>\
لِغَرَضٍ صَحِيحٍ (tropical:)  He did, or acted, for a just, or<br>\
right, object of aim &amp;c. (Msb.) And فَهِمْتُ<br>\

object of aim &amp;c., or thine intention; syn. قَصْدَكَ.<br>\

also the inf. n.]<br>\
غَرِضٌ, when followed by مِنْ, Vexed, or disquieted by grief, and by distress of mind; grieved,<br>\

of the paragraph.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Fresh, or juicy, dates. (TA.)<br>\

part of the day. (TA.) ―<br>\

-b6-  Also Any new, or novel, song.<br>\
(IB, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And hence, A singer; because of<br>\
his performing new, or novel, singing: (IB, TA:)<br>\
