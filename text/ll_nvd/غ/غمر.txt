-A3-  غَمِرَةٌ as<br>\
an epithet applied to a she-camel, see voce غَبِرٌ.<br>\

which people divided the water among themselves<br>\
in a journey when they had little of it; and this<br>\
they [sometimes] did by putting a pebble into a<br>\
vessel, and then pouring into it as much water<br>\
as would cover the pebble, and giving it to each<br>\
man among them: (TA:) or the smallest of drinking-cups or bowls: (K:) [see قَعْبٌ; and تِبْنٌ:]<br>\
accord. to ISh, it contains twice or thrice the<br>\
quantity of the measure called كِيلَجَة: [but this<br>\
seems to be a large غمر, used for watering a<br>\
horse; and the words which here immediately<br>\
follow are app. not added by ISh, but relate to<br>\
the غمر used by a man for himself or for another<br>\
man:] the قَعْب is larger than it, and satisfies the<br>\
thirst of a man: the pl. is أَغْمَارٌ. (TA.) El-Aashà<br>\
of Báhileh says, in an elegy on his brother ElMunteshir Ibn-Wahb,<br>\
تَكْفِيهِ حُزَّةُ فِلْذٍ إِنْ أَلْمَّ بِهَا<br>\

صَلُّوا عَلَى أَوَّلَ الدُّعَآءِ وَأَوْسَطَهُ وَآخِرَهُ Make ye me<br>\
not like the غُمَر of the rider: salute me in the<br>\
beginning of prayer and in the middle thereof and<br>\
in the end thereof: meaning that they should not<br>\
make the salutation of him to be a thing of no<br>\
great importance, and to be postponed: for the<br>\
rider puts on his camel his saddle and his travel-ling-provisions, and last of all hangs upon his<br>\
saddle his drinking-cup. (IAth, TA.)<br>\
غُمُرٌ: see غُمْرٌ.<br>\
غَمْرَةٌ Water that rises above the stature of a<br>\
man. (Bd in xxiii. 56.) See also غَمْرٌ, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (Bd,) فَذَرْهُمْ فِى غَمْرَتِهِمْ, in the<br>\
Kur xxiii. 56, (tropical:)  Therefore leave thou them in [the<br>\
submerging gulf, or flood, of] their ignorance;<br>\
(Fr, Bd;) or in their error: (Jel:) or in their<br>\
error and obstinacy and perplexity: (Zj, in explanation of another reading, فى غَمَرَاتِهِمْ:) and in<br>\

مِنْ لَهْوٍ, and شَبِيبَةٍ, and سُكْرٍ, (tropical:)  [He is in a submerging gulf, or flood, of frivolous diversion, and<br>\

(S, Msb, K,) and pressure, of a thing: (K:) pl.<br>\

but the بُهْمَى: (TA:) the pl. is أَغْمِرَآءُ. (K.)<br>\

thus, (TA,) waste; desolate; in a state the contrary of flourishing; in a state of ruin; syn.<br>\
خَرَابٌ: (Msb, K, TA:) [land to which this term<br>\

covered with sand or dust; or because water<br>\
generally exudes from it, so that it produces only<br>\
reeds and the بَرْدِىّ [i. e. papyrus or other rushes]:<br>\

and مَآءٌ دَافِقٌ; and made of the measure فال<br>\
only to correspond to عَامِرٌ as its opposite: (S,<br>\
TA:) waste land which water does not reach is<br>\
not called غَامِرٌ; (S;) but such is called قَفْرٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) It is said in a trad., [which shows that<br>\
the last two explanations given above are correct,]<br>\
that &#39;Omar imposed a tax of a دِرْهَم and a قَفِيز<br>\
upon every جَرِيب [of land], both عَامِر and غَامِر:<br>\
and this he did in order that the people might<br>\
