غَلَقَ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n.<br>\
غَلَقٌ, (S, O, Msb,) or غُلُوقٌ, (IAar, TA,) or both,<br>\
(Sb, TA,) (tropical:)  The pledge was, or became, a rightful<br>\
possession [i. e. a forfeit] to the receiver of it (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, K) when not redeemed within the<br>\
time stipulated; (S, O, K;) or so غَلِقَ الرَّهْنُ فِى<br>\
يَدِ المُرْتَهِنِ: (Sb, TA:) or غَلِقَ الرَّهْنُ means the<br>\
pledge remained in the hand [or possession] of the<br>\
receiver of it, the pledger being unable to redeem<br>\
it; (IAar, TA;) accord. to the Bári&#39;, it is when<br>\
a man pledges a commodity and says, “If I do<br>\
not pay thee within such a time, the pledge shall<br>\
be thine for the debt. ” (Msb.) This is forbidden<br>\
in a trad. (S, Mgh, O, Msb, &amp;c.) It is said in<br>\
a trad. of the Prophet on this subject, لَا يَغْلَقُ بِمَا<br>\
فِيهِ لَكَ غُنْمُهُ وُعَلَيْكَ غُرْمُهُ [meaning It shall not<br>\
become a forfeit to the receiver with what is<br>\
involved in it: (or, accord. to an explanation of<br>\
the first clause in the Msb, it shall not become a<br>\
rightful possession to the receiver for the debt for<br>\
which it was pledged:) to thee shall pertain the<br>\
regaining of it, and its increase, and growth, and<br>\
excess in value, if such there be, and upon thee<br>\
shall be the obligation of the debt belonging to it,<br>\
and the bearing of any unavoidable damage that<br>\
it may have sustained]: (O:) or لَهُ غُنْمُهُ وَعَلَيْهِ<br>\
غُرْمُهُ i. e., accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, to him (the owner)<br>\
it shall return, and to him shall pertain its increase<br>\
[if there be any], and if it have become defective,<br>\
or have perished, [unavoidably,] he shall be responsible for it and shall pay the debt to him to whom<br>\
it is owed without being compensated by [the remission of] aught of the debt: (Msb:) or لَكَ<br>\
غُنْمُهُ وَعَلَيْهِ غُرْمُهُ, which means to thee (the pledger)<br>\
shall pertain the increase of it (the pledge), and<br>\
its growth, and its excess in value, [if it have any,]<br>\
and upon him (the receiver of it) shall be the responsibility [to make compensation] for it if it<br>\
perish [through his fault, in his possession], (O.<br>\
[There are other, somewhat different, readings<br>\
and explanations of this trad. in the Mgh &amp;c.;<br>\
but what I have here given, from the O and<br>\
Msb, appear to me to be the most approvable.<br>\
See also غُنْمٌ: and see art. رهن.]) Zuheyr says,<br>\
وَفَارَقَتْكَ بِرَهْنٍ لَا فَكَاكَ لَهُ<br>\
يَوْمَ الوَدَاعِ فَأَمْسَى الرَّهْنُ قَدْ غَلِقَا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [And she separated herself from thee with a<br>\
pledge for which there is nothing wherewith it<br>\
may be redeemed, on the day of valediction, so<br>\
the pledge has become a forfeit to its receiver]:<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, TA:) he means that she received<br>\
his heart as a pledge, and went away with it.<br>\
(Mgh, TA.) The saying of Ows Ibn-Hajar<br>\
أَبُو غَلَقٍ فِى لَيْلَتَيْنِ مُؤَجَّلِ<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  The owner of a pledge that has become a<br>\
rightful possession [or forfeit] to its receiver, the<br>\
period for the release of which is two nights: to<br>\
this he likens a captivated heart. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  One<br>\
says also, of a slave who has received permission<br>\
to traffic, غَلِقَتْ رَقَبَتُهُ بِالدَّيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  His رَقَبَة [meaning<br>\
person] has become a rightful possession [or a forfeit to his creditor or creditors] by reason of debt,<br>\
when he is unable to free it. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And غَلِقَ<br>\
signifies also (assumed tropical:)  He was unransomed, or unredeemed; said of a captive, and of a criminal.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (tropical:)  He, or it, stuck fast: (S, O,<br>\
TA:) thus in the saying, غَلِقَ قَلْبُهُ فِى يَدِ فُلَانَةَ<br>\
[His heart stuck fast in the possession of such a<br>\
woman or girl]: (TA:) and اِحْتَدَّ فَغَلِقَ فِى حِدَّتِهِ<br>\
[He became excited by sharpness of temper, and<br>\
stuck fast in his sharpness of temper]: (S, O. TA:)<br>\
and غَلِقَ is said of anything that sticks fast in a<br>\
thing, and cleaves to it: thus one says, غَلِقَ فِى<br>\
البَاطِلِ [He stuck fast in that which was vain, or<br>\
false]: and the saying of El-Farezdak<br>\
وَلَوْ كَانُوا أُولِى غَلَقٍ سِغَابَا<br>\
means Had they been persons who had stack fast<br>\
in poverty and hunger, cleaving thereto. (Sh, TA.)<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, disquieted, (Mgh,) or disquieted by grief; (Mgh, Msb;) or angry, (Msb,<br>\
TA.) and excited by sharpness of temper. (TA.)<br>\
Hence يَمِينُ الغَلَقِ (assumed tropical:)  The oath of anger; said by<br>\
some of the lawyers to be so called because he<br>\
who swears it closes thereby against himself a<br>\
door preventing him from advancing or drawing<br>\
back. (Msb.) And hence إِيَّاكَ وَالغَلَقَ (assumed tropical:)  Beware<br>\
thou of, or avoid thou, the being disquieted, or disquieted by grief [or anger]: or, as some say, the<br>\
meaning is, التَّطْلِيقَاتُ حَتَّى لَا يَبْقَى مِنْهَا ↓ لَا يُغْلَقُ<br>\
شَىْءٌ (assumed tropical:)  [i. e. The sentences of divorce shall not be<br>\
closed, or concluded, at once, by one&#39;s saying<br>\
“ Thou art trebly divorced,” so that there shall<br>\
not remain of them aught]; for one should divorce<br>\
agreeably with the سُنَّة: (Mgh:) [or, accord. to<br>\
the TA, إِيَّاكَ وَالغَلَقَ app. means beware thou of,<br>\
or avoid thou, the state of straitness:] and الغَلَقُ<br>\
signifies also the being in a state of perdition:<br>\
(TA:) and contractedness of the mind or bosom,<br>\
(Mbr, JK, TA,) and paucity of patience. (Mbr,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  One says also, غَلِقَتِ النَّخْلَةُ, (O. K,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. غَلَقٌ, (TA,) : The palm-tree had<br>\
worms in the bases of its branches and was thereby<br>\
stopped from bearing fruit; (O, K, TA;) and so<br>\
عَنِ الإِثْمَارِ ↓ أُغْلِقَتْ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And غَلِقَ ظَهْرُ<br>\
البَعِيرِ, (S, O, K, TA,) inf. n. غَلَقٌ, (S, O, TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  The back of the camel became galled with galls<br>\
not to be cured; (S, O, K, TA;) the whole of his<br>\
back being seen to be two portions of cicatrized<br>\
skin, the results of galls that had become in a<br>\
healing state, and the two sides thereof glistening:<br>\
ISh says that in the case of the worst galls of the<br>\
camel, the furniture, or saddle and saddle-cloth,<br>\
cannot be [partially] raised from contact with<br>\
him [so as to be bearable by him]. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\

3<br>\
مُغَالَقَةٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The contending for a bet,<br>\
or wager; syn. مُرَاهَنَةٌ; (O, K;) originally, in<br>\

mare in order that he should contend upon her in<br>\

inf. n. إِغْلَاقٌ, (Mgh, K, &amp;c.,) He made the door<br>\
fast with a غَلَق, so that it could not be opened<br>\
unless with a key; (Msb;) [i. e.] he locked the<br>\
door; or bolted it: or he closed, or shut, it:<br>\
(MA:) contr. of فَتَحَهُ: (O, K: *) and ↓ غَلَقَهُ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
غَلِقَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. غَلْقٌ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb,) signifies the same; (S, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
mentioned by IDrd, on the authority of AZ; but<br>\
rare; (Msb;) or a mispronunciation; (K;) or<br>\
bad, (S, O, K,) and rejected; (S;) and غَلْقٌ is<br>\
[said to be] the subst. from أَغْلَقَ; (S, Mgh, K;)<br>\
whence the saying of a poet,<br>\
وَبَابٍ إِذَا مَا مَالَ لِلْغَلْقِ يَصْرِفُ<br>\
[And a door that, when it turns to be locked, or<br>\
closed, creaks]: (S, O, Mgh: *) and one says,<br>\
الأَبْوَابَ ↓ غَلَّقْتُ [I locked, or closed, the doors];<br>\
the verb being with teshdeed to denote multiplicity [of the objects]; (Sb, S, TA;) [and] it is<br>\
so to denote muchness [of the action] or intensiveness, (O,) [for] one says also, البَابَ ↓ غلّق, a<br>\
chaste phrase; El-Isbahánee says that ↓ غَلَّقْتُ<br>\
signifies I locked, or closed, (أَغْلَقْتُ,) many doors,<br>\
or a door several times, or a door well or thoroughly;<br>\
(TA;) and one says also أَغْلَقْتُ الأَبْوَابَ; (S, O,<br>\
TA;) said by Sb to be a good Arabic phrase;<br>\
(TA;) but this is rare; (O;) El-Farezdak says,<br>\
مَا زِلْتُ أَفْتَحُ أَبْوَابًا وَأُغْلِقُهَا<br>\
حَتَّى أَتَيْتُ أَبَا عَمْرِو بْنَ عَمَّارِ<br>\
[I ceased not to open doors and to close them until<br>\
I came to Aboo-&#39;Amr Ibn-&#39;Ammár], meaning, as<br>\
AHát says, Aboo-&#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;Alà. (S, O, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence] one says, أُغْلِقَ عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرُ (assumed tropical:)  The affair<br>\
was [as though it were closed against him; i. e.,<br>\
was made] strait to him. (TA. [See also 10.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence] إِغْلَاقٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The act of constraining: (Mgh, O, TA:) whence the saying in<br>\
a trad., لَا طَلَاقَ وَلَا عَتَاقَ فِى إِغْلَاقٍ (assumed tropical:)  [There is no<br>\
divorcement of a wife, nor liberation of a slave,<br>\
in a case of constraint]; (Mgh, * O, TA;) for the<br>\
agent is straitened in his affair, (Mgh, TA,) as<br>\
though the door were locked, or closed, against<br>\
him, and he were imprisoned. (TA.) One says,<br>\
أَغْلَقَهُ عَلَى شَىْءٍ (assumed tropical:)  He constrained him to do a<br>\
thing. (IAar, Mgh, TA.) ―<br>\

-b5-  One says also, اغلق<br>\
الرَّهْنَ (tropical:)  He made, or declared, the pledge to be<br>\
due [or a forfeit to its receiver]. (IAar, TA.)<br>\

(tropical:)  They make the stake, or wager, or thing playedfor, to be due [or a forfeit] to the player (O, TA)<br>\
who wins, or is successful. (TA.) ―<br>\

القَاتِلَ (assumed tropical:)  He delivered, or surrendered, the slayer<br>\
to the heir, or next of kin, of the slain, that he<br>\

(O, TA.) And أُغْلِقَ فُلَانٌ بِجَرِيرَتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one<br>\
was delivered, or surrendered, to be punished for<br>\
his crime]. (TA.) And El-Farezdak says,<br>\
أَسَارَى حَدِيدٍ أُغْلِقَتْ بِدِمَآئِهَا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Captives in bonds of iron, delivered, or surrendered, to be punished for their bloods that<br>\
they had shed]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And أُغْلِقَ فُلَانٌ (assumed tropical:)  Such<br>\
a one was angered. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And الإِغْلَاقُ [or<br>\
rather إِغْلَاقُ ظَهْرِ البَعِيرِ] signifies (assumed tropical:)  The galling<br>\
of the back of the camel by heavy loads: (K,<br>\
TA:) whence the phrase مَنْ أَغْلَقَ ظَهْرَهُ [meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Such as has heavily burdened his back with sins],<br>\
applied, in a trad., to one of those for whom the<br>\
Prophet will intercede; the sins that have burdened the back of the man being likened to the<br>\
weight of the load of the camel: [but] it is also<br>\
said that الإِغْلَاقُ was a practice of the Time of<br>\
Ignorance; that when the camels of any one of<br>\
them amounted to a hundred, أَغْلَقُوا بَعِيرًا, i. e.<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  They displaced the سَنَاسِن [pl. of سِنْسِنٌ, q. v.]<br>\
of one of the vertebræ of a camel, and wounded<br>\
his hump, in order that he might not be ridden,<br>\
and that no use might be made of his back; and<br>\
that camel was termed مُعَنًّى [q. v. in art. عنو].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تغالقوا They contended, one with another, for<br>\
bets, or wagers. See 3.]<br>\

Locks, as a pl. pl., i. e. as pl. of أَغْلَاقٌ, which is<br>\
pl. of غَلَقٌ.]<br>\
مُغْلَقٌ: see غُلُقٌ.<br>\
مِغْلَقٌ: see غَلَقٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S, O, K, TA,) and<br>\
↓ مِغْلَاقٌ is a dial. var. thereof in this sense, (TA,)<br>\
An arrow, (K,) i. e. any arrow, (S, O,) used in<br>\
the game called المَيْسِر: (S, O, K:) or, (K,)<br>\
accord. to Lth, (O,) المِغْلَقُ signifies السَّهْمُ السّابِعُ<br>\
فِى مُضَعَّفِ المَيْسِرِ [i. e. the seventh arrow, app.<br>\
belonging to the class, of the arrows of the game<br>\
of الميسر, to which manifold portions are assigned;<br>\
for المُضَعَّفُ as used in relation to the game called<br>\
الميسر I do not find expl. otherwise than as an<br>\
appellation of “ the second of the arrows termed<br>\
الغُفْل, to which are assigned no portion; ” (see<br>\
art. ضعف, and see also سَفِيحٌ;) and this cannot<br>\
be here meant, as the seventh arrow (which is<br>\
commonly called المُعَلَّى) has seven portions<br>\
assigned to it: therefore it seems that مُضَعَّف is<br>\
here used, if not mistakenly, in a sense which,<br>\
though admissible, is unusual in a case of this<br>\
kind]: (O, K:) pl. مَغَالِقُ: (S, O, K: in the<br>\
CK [erroneously] مَغَالِيقُ:) or المُغَالِقُ is one of<br>\
the epithets applied to the winning arrows, and is<br>\
not one of their [particular] names; (O, K;) they<br>\
being those that make what is played-for to be<br>\
a forfeit to the player (تُغْلِقُ الخَطَرَ لِلْقَامِرِ): so<br>\
accord. to Az, who says that Lth has made a<br>\
mistake in his explanation. (O.)<br>\
مِغْلَاقٌ: see غَلَقٌ. [Hence] one says, فُلَانٌ<br>\
مِفْتَاحٌ لِلْخَيْرِ مِغْلَاقٌ لِلشَّرِّ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one is a key<br>\
to that which is good, a lock to that which is evil].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. مِرْتَاجٌ [A thing with which a<br>\
door is closed, or made fast, (app. a kind of latch,)<br>\
affixed behind the door, in the part next to the<br>\
lock]. (TA.) [See art. رتج: and see مِعْلَاقٌ, which<br>\
seems to have the same, or a similar, meaning.])<br>\
―<br>\

And ذُو مِغْلَاقٍ means اَلَّذِى تُغْلَقُ عَلَى يَدِهِ قِدَاحُ<br>\
المَيْسِرِ (assumed tropical:)  [app. One by means of whom the arrows<br>\
in the game called الميسر are withheld from the<br>\
rest of the players; i. e. by his winning]: or,<br>\
accord. to Z, يُغْلِقُ الحُجَّةَ عَلَى الخَصْمِ (assumed tropical:)  [app. one<br>\
who closes the argument against the adversary in<br>\
a dispute]. (TA in art. علق.) ―<br>\
