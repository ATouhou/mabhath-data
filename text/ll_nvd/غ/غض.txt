غَضَّ طَرْفَهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor. يَغُضُّ, (Msb, *<br>\
TA,) [and يَغْضُضْ may be used, in the dial. of<br>\
El-Hijáz, instead of its contracted form يَغُضَّ,]<br>\
imp. غُضَّ, (S, A,) in the dial. of Nejd, (S,) and<br>\
اُغْضُضْ, in the dial. of El-Hijáz, (S,) inf. n. غَضٌّ<br>\
(Msb, K) and غِضَاضٌ, with kesr, (A, K,) and<br>\
غَضَاضٌ and غَضَاضَةٌ, with fet-h, (K,) He lowered<br>\
his eye, or eyes; (S, A, Msb, K;) as also غَضَّ<br>\
مِنْ طَرْفِهِ; (Msb;) [the من being redundant,<br>\
accord. to some; but see what is said on this<br>\
point below:] and he contracted his eye, or eyes;<br>\
syn. كَسَرَهُ; [so as to wrinkle the lids;] or he<br>\
blinked; i. e. he contracted his eyelids, or drew<br>\
them near together, and looked: [this signification is very common:] and he contracted (كَسَرَ)<br>\
his eye, or eyes, and looked towards the ground,<br>\
not opening his eye [or eyes]: and sometimes it<br>\
indicates a state of abasement. (TA.) Also غَضَّ<br>\
alone, inf. n. غَضَاضَةٌ, He contracted his eyelids;<br>\
like أَغْضَى: he looked languishingly. (TA.) It<br>\
is said in the Kur [xxiv. 30], قُلْ لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَغُضُّوا<br>\
مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِمْ, in which some of the grammarians<br>\
hold من to be redundant; but the meaning is<br>\
obvious, i. e. [Say thou to the believers] that they<br>\
shall abridge their look, or view, from what is<br>\
prohibited to them: (Sgh:) or that they shall<br>\
restrain somewhat of their look, or view. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He bore with forgiveness and<br>\
silence what was disagreeable, or hateful, or evil.<br>\
(S, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  غَضَّ صَوْتَهُ, (Msb,) or مِنْ صَوْتِهِ,<br>\
(S, TA,) or both, (Msb,) in like manner signifies<br>\
He lowered his voice. (S, Msb.) It is said in the<br>\
Kur [xxxi. 18], وَاغْضُضْ مِنْ صَوْتِكَ, (S, A,) i. e.<br>\
And lower thy voice: or diminish the loudness of<br>\
thy voice. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  غَضَّ مِنْ لِجَامِ فَرَسِهِ He<br>\
lowered the rein of his horse, in order to lessen his<br>\
sharpness of temper. (A, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b5-  غَضَّ مِنْهُ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) aor. يَغُضُّ, (S, TA,) inf. n. غَضٌّ (Msb,<br>\
TA) and غَضَاضَةٌ, (Msb,) He lowered and lessened<br>\
his estimation, dignity, or rank: (S, K, TA:) or<br>\
he detracted from his reputation; or attributed<br>\
or imputed to him, charged him with, or accused<br>\
him of, a vice, fault, or the like: (Msb:) and,<br>\
inf. n. غَضَاضَةٌ, he disdained it, or scorned it; as<br>\
also مِنْهُ ↓ اغتضّ. (&#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
Also غَضَّهُ, (K,) aor. as above, inf. n. غَضٌّ, (TA,)<br>\
He lessened it, diminished it, or made it defective<br>\
or deficient; (K, TA;) and so ↓ غَضْغَضَهُ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. غَصْغَضَةٌ. (TA.) You say غَضَضْتُ السِّقَآءَ<br>\
I lessened, diminished, or made defective or deficient, [the contents of] the skin. (Msb.) And<br>\
المَآءَ ↓ غَضْغَضْتُ I lessened, &amp;c., the water. (S.)<br>\
And ↓ فُلَانٌ بَحْرٌ لَا يُغَضْغَضُ Such a one is a sea,<br>\
or great river, that will not be lessened, &amp;c.: (S:)<br>\
or that will not become exhausted. (Har p. 418.)<br>\
[See also R. Q. 1 below, and R. Q. 2.] And<br>\
[you make the former verb doubly trans., saying,]<br>\
مَا غَضَضْتُكَ شَيْئًا I have not abridged thee, deprived<br>\
thee, or defrauded thee, of anything. (TA.) And<br>\
لَا أَغُضُّكَ دِرْهَمًا I will not abridge thee, deprive thee,<br>\
or defraud thee, of a dirhem. (TA.) You also<br>\
say, غَضَّ مِنَ الشَّعَرِ He shortened the hair. (M in<br>\
art. قصر.) And [in like manner] one says, غَضَّ<br>\
مِنْ رَأْسِهِ, i. q. طَمَّ رَأْسَهُ. (K voce طَمَّ, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
Also He broke it (i. e. a branch, or stick, or the<br>\
like,) but did not break it thoroughly; (L, K,<br>\
TA;) and so ↓ غضّضهُ. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And غَضَضْتُهُ<br>\
also signifies I withheld, restrained, or prevented,<br>\
it; whatever it were. (S.) [Hence the phrase in<br>\
the Kur xxiv, 30, accord. to an explanation given<br>\
above.] You say غَضَّ العَذْلَ, or المَلَامَةَ, aor. as<br>\
above, inf. n. غَصٌّ, He withheld blame. (Lth.)<br>\
And you say to a rider, in asking him to stop a<br>\
little where you are, غُضَّ سَاعَةً, (TA,) and اُغْضُضْ<br>\
لِى سَاعَةً, (A, TA,) i. e. Restrain for me thy<br>\
beast, and stop, or pause, where I am, a while.<br>\
(A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  غَضَّ, [first pers. غَضَضْتُ,] aor. يَغِضُّ;<br>\
(Msb;) or the first pers. is غَضِضْتُ and غَضَضْتُ,<br>\
(S, K,) and the aor. of each is يَغَضُّ; (K;) or,<br>\
accord. to the T, some say غَضِضْتَ, aor. تَغَضُّ,<br>\
and some say غَضَضْتَ, aor. تَغَضُّ: (IB, TA;)<br>\
but the latter of these requires consideration;<br>\
(TA;) inf. n. غُضُوضَةٌ (IAar, S, K) and غَضَاضَةٌ;<br>\
(S, K;) or the former only, accord to Alee Ibn-<br>\
Hamzeh; but the saying بَضَاضَةٌ and بُضُوضَةٌ, to<br>\
denote the quality of that which is termed بَضٌّ,<br>\
strengthens what J says [in the S] with respect<br>\
to غَضَاضَةٌ; (IB;) It (a thing) was, or became,<br>\
fresh, juicy, sappy, moist, not flaccid. (S, Msb:)<br>\
or flourishing and fresh; or luxuriant: (IAar:)<br>\
or beautiful and bright: (K:) and غَضَّتْ, aor.<br>\
تَغِضُّ and تَغَضُّ, inf. n. غَضَاضَةٌ and غُضُوضَةٌ, said<br>\
of a woman, (tropical:)  she was, or became, fine-skinned, or<br>\
thin-skinned, so that the blood appeared [through<br>\
the skin]. (Lh, TA.)<br>\

-A2-  Also, inf. n.<br>\
تَغْضِيضٌ, He ate what is termed غَضّ, (K, TA,)<br>\
i. e. the طَلْع [or spadix of a palm-tree]: (TA:)<br>\
or he became thin-skinned, and plump, and soft,<br>\
or tender: (O, K:) or he became affected with<br>\
languor and abasement; (K, TA;) or, as in the<br>\
Tekmileh, with softness, or tenderness. (TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انغضّ الطَّرْفُ i. q. انْغَمَضَ: (S, TA:) [or the<br>\
former more probably signifies The eye, or eyes,<br>\
became contracted: and the latter, the eye, or<br>\
eyes, became closed.]<br>\

غَضْغَضَهُ, inf. n. غَضْغَضَةٌ: see 1, near<br>\
the middle, in three places.<br>\

large river, TA) became scanty, or little in quantity, and sank into the earth, or disappeared in<br>\
the earth; or became scanty, or little in quantity;<br>\
or decreased: (K, TA:) or went away. (TA.)<br>\
In the TS, the inf. n. is expl. by غَيْظ, which is<br>\
an abominable mistake for غَيْض. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
غَضْغَضَةٌ also signifies A man&#39;s speaking indistinctly. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And The boiling of a cooking-pot. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تغَضْغَضَ It (water, and a sea, or<br>\
great river, S) decreased, diminished, lessened, or<br>\
became defective, or deficient; (S, K;) as also<br>\
↓ غَضْغَضَ, (TA,) inf. n. غَضْغَضَةٌ. (Msb.) You<br>\
say, مَاتَ فُلَانٌ بِبِطْنَتِهِ لَمْ يَتَغَضْغَضْ مِنْهَا شَىْءٌ Such<br>\
a one died with his property abundant, (S,) or<br>\
complete; nothing thereof having been given away<br>\
by him; a prov. relating to the death of the<br>\
niggard. (A &#39;Obeyd.) And &#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;As said,<br>\
alluding to the death of Ibn-&#39;Owf. خَرَجْتَ مِنَ<br>\
الدُّنْيَا بِبِطْنَتِكَ وَلَمْ تَتَغَضْغَضْ مِنْهَا شَيْئًا, meaning<br>\

say also مَطَرٌ لَا يَتَغَضْغَضُ Rain that will not cease<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
غَضٌّ Fresh; juicy; sappy: moist; not flaccid;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) applied to a thing, (S, Msb,) whatever it be; (TA;) as also ↓ غَضِيضً. (S. K,)<br>\
Hence the trad. مَنْ سَرَّهُ أَنْ يَقْرَأُ القُرْآنَ غَضًّا كَمَا<br>\
نَزَلَ فَلْيَقْرَأْ قِرَآءَةَ ابْنِ أَمِّ عَبْدٍ [He who is rejoiced<br>\
