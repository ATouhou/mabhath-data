غَطَلَتِ السَّمَآءُ (JK, O, K) يَوْمَنَا هٰذَا, (JK, O,)<br>\
and ↓ أَغْطَلَت, (JK, O, K,) The sky has [by its<br>\
becoming overcast] concealed the light of the sun<br>\
[in this our day]: (JK:) or its دَجْن [or shade<br>\
of the clouds in a rainy day, or its abundant rain,<br>\
or its covering of clouds full of moisture, and dark,<br>\
but containing no rain,] has overspread. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  And غَطِلَ اللَّيْلُ, aor.<br>\
غَطَلَ, (K, TA,) inf. n. غَطَلٌ,<br>\
(TA,) The darkness of the night became confused.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَغْطَلَ see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
Q. Q. 1<br>\
غَطْيَلَ, (O, K, TA,) with the ط before<br>\
the ى, (K, * TA,) He was, or became, abundant<br>\
in his property, or cattle, and his dependents, or<br>\
relations and household, or servants, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
and his weal. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And غَيْطَلَ, (O, TA,)<br>\
thus correctly in the following senses, accord. to<br>\
the K غَطْيَلَ, but this is a mistake, (TA,) He<br>\
made his traffic to be in beasts of the bovine kind,<br>\
bulls or cows, (O, K, TA,) which are termed<br>\
غَيْطَلٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And غَيْطَلَ القَوْمُ فِى الحَدِيثِ<br>\
The people, or party, pushed on, pressed on, or<br>\
were copious or profuse, in discourse; or entered<br>\
into it; and their voices became high: (K, * TA:)<br>\
on the authority of El-Hejeree. (TA.) [Accord.<br>\
to the K غَطْيَلَ, which is said in the TA to be a<br>\
mistake.]<br>\
Q. Q. 4<br>\
اِغْطَأَلَّ It became heaped up, or it<br>\
mounted, one part upon another: (A &#39;Obeyd, O,<br>\
K, TA:) and so اِغْظَأَلَّ, mentioned by IKtt:<br>\
(TA:) the former verb occurs in a verse of<br>\
Hassán Ibn-Thábit, said of the sea. (O, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And, said of the heat, It rose, or became<br>\
raised. (R, TA.)<br>\
غَيْطَلٌ is pl. of ↓ غَيْطَلَةٌ, [or rather a coll. gen. n.<br>\
of which the latter is the n. un.,] signifying<br>\
Numerous dense or tangled trees: (S, O:) or the<br>\
latter word signifies thus: (K:) or it (the latter)<br>\
signifies also dense, or tangled, trees: (S, O:) or<br>\
both signify thus: and also anything confused, or<br>\
mixed: (Ham p. 213:) or the latter has this last<br>\
meaning: and signifies also a collection of trees<br>\
and of herbs; (AHn, TA;) and a collection of<br>\
[the common tamarisks, called] طَرْفَآء; (K, TA;)<br>\
as AHn says on one occasion. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[the former, or perhaps both words,] The light of<br>\
the dawn when mingling with the darkness of the<br>\
night. (Ham p. 213 [q. v.].) ―<br>\
-b3-  And غَيْطَلُ<br>\
الضُّحَى signifies حَيْثُ تَكُونُ الشَّمْسُ مِنْ مَشْرِقِهَا<br>\
كَهَيْئَتِهَا مِنْ مَغْرِبِهَا وَقْتَ الظُّهْرِ, (JK, O, and so<br>\
in copies of the K,) or بَعْدَ الظُّهْرِ, (accord. to the<br>\
text of the K in the TA,) or وَقْتَ العَصْرِ: (so in<br>\
some copies of the K, as mentioned in the TK:)<br>\
[the last is evidently the right reading; and the<br>\
meaning, The period of the earlier part of the<br>\
forenoon, after sunrise, when the sun is distant<br>\
from its place of rising like as it is from its place<br>\
of setting at the time of the عَصْر (q. v.): الظهر is<br>\
probably an old mistranscription.]<br>\
-A2-  Also Beasts<br>\
of the bovine kind, bulls or cows. (TA.) [See also<br>\
غَيْطَلَةٌ, last explanation.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And The cat: (K,<br>\
TA:) as also خَيْطَلٌ: on the authority of Kr.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
غَيْطَلَةٌ: see غَيْطَلٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A company, or<br>\
collection, (Th, K, TA,) of men: (K, TA:) or<br>\
the assembling of men, and their becoming in a<br>\
dense, or confused, state. (IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
Darkness; as also ↓ غَيْطُولٌ; (K;) or the latter<br>\
signifies confusedness of darkness; (IDrd, O;) or<br>\
signifies also dense (lit. accumulated) darkness.<br>\
(K. [The Arabs describe thick darkness as<br>\
“ darknesses one above another: ” see Kur xxiv.<br>\
40.]) And The intricate and confused blackness<br>\
of night: (S, O, K:) or غَيْطَلَةُ اللَّيْلِ signifies the<br>\
confusedness and denseness of the darkness [of<br>\
night]: and the pl. is غَيَاطِلُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also<br>\
A confusion, or mixture, of cries or shouts or<br>\
noises; (S, * O, * K;) and so ↓ غَيْطُولٌ: (IDrd,<br>\
O, K:) غَيْطَلَاتٌ, pl. of the former, signifies clamours of men: and the sing., the numerous cries<br>\
or shouts or noises, and the dust, of war, or battle.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And The overpowering influence of<br>\
drowsiness: (O, K:) [or so غَيْطَلَةُ نُعَاسٍ: pl.<br>\
غَيَاطِلُ:] one says, رَيَّثَتْهُ غَيَاطِلُ النُّعَاسِ meaning<br>\
غَوَالِبُهُ [i. e. The overpowering influences of drowsiness retarded him, or made him late]. (A, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And The means of happiness of the present<br>\
world or state of existence: (K:) or غَيَاطِلُ الدُّنْيَا<br>\
means those means of happiness: (O:) or this<br>\
latter phrase means the consecutive means of happiness of the present world. (TA.) And The<br>\
eating and drinking and rejoicing, with security.<br>\
(Fr, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And الغَيْطَلَةُ (accord. to Fr, as is<br>\
said in the O and TA,) signifies المَالُ المُطْغِى<br>\
[as though most probably meaning Property that<br>\
causes extravagance]: (O, K, TA:) [but from<br>\
what SM remarks respecting it, I can only infer<br>\
that he holds المُطْغِى to be an epithet applied to<br>\
the cow as signifying “ having a youngling,”<br>\
which is termed طَغْيَا or طُغْيَا, (like المُعْجِلُ signifying “ having a calf,” which is termed عِجْلٌ,<br>\
and several other epithets of the same form,) and<br>\
in like manner applied to a collective number of<br>\
cows, though I do not find it mentioned in this<br>\
sense; i. e., that he understands; and would<br>\
explain, المَالُ المُطْغِى as signifying The cattle,<br>\
meaning cows, having younglings: but his derivation of it seems to be far-fetched; and perhaps<br>\
he may have been led to assign this meaning to<br>\
it by another explanation of غَيْطَلَةٌ with which it<br>\
is agreeable, and which will be found in the next<br>\
sentence:] it is not [he says] from طَغَا, aor. يَطْغُو,<br>\
signifying أَسْرَفَ فِى الظُّلْمِ, as it seems to be at<br>\
first sight; but from طَغَتْ said of the بَقَرَة وَحْشِيَّة,<br>\
signifying صَاحَتْ, the like of which is also said<br>\
of the ثَوْر. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  غَيْطَلَةٌ signifies also Such<br>\
as has milk, of gazelles, or antelopes, and of beasts<br>\
of the bovine kind [perhaps meaning of the wild<br>\
species, i. e. bovine antelopes]; (S, O, K;) pl.<br>\
غَيَاطِلُ: (S, O:) accord. to AO, the بَقَرَة وَحْشِيَّة<br>\
[or bovine antelope]: (S, O:) Th says that it signifies the بَقَرَة [or beast of the bovine kind, bull or<br>\
cow], not particularizing the wild species. (TA.)<br>\
[See also غَيْطَلٌ, last explanation but one.]<br>\
غَيْطُولٌ: see غَيْطَلَةٌ, first quarter, in two places.<br>\
غُوطَالَةٌ i. q. رَوْضَةٌ [generally meaning A meadow].<br>\
(IAar, O, K.)<br>\
شَجَرٌ مُغْطَئِلٌّ Dense, or tangled, trees. (JK.<br>\
[See also غَيْطَلٌ.]) And غُصُونٌ Soft, or<br>\
tender, branches, (O, TA,) having dense leaves.<br>\
