غَدَا, (S, M, Msb, K,) aor. يَغْدُو, (S, M,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. عُدُوٌّ (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and غَدْوٌ<br>\
(M, TA, and so accord. to the CK instead of غُدُوٌّ<br>\
[which is the only inf. n. commonly known]) and<br>\
غُدْوَةٌ, (K,) He went, or went away, in the time<br>\
called غُدْوَة, (Mgh, Msb,) i. e. [the early part of<br>\
the morning,] the period between the prayer of<br>\
daybreak and sunrise: this is the primary signification: (Msb:) or i. q. بَكَّرَ [he went forth<br>\
early in the morning; in the first part of the<br>\
day; or between the time of the prayer of daybreak and sunrise]; so in the phrase غَدَا عَلَيْهِ<br>\
[he went forth early in the morning, &amp;c., to him,<br>\
or it]; (K;) as also ↓ اغتدى: (S, * K:) and<br>\
↓ غاداهُ signifies the same as غَدَا عَلَيْهِ; (S;) or<br>\
the same as بَاكَرَهُ [which is syn. with بَكَّرَ عَلَيْهِ as<br>\
expl. above; and signifies also, like بَكَّرَ عَلَيْهِ, he<br>\
hastened to it, or to do it, at any time, morning<br>\
or evening]: (ISd, K, TA:) الغُدُوُّ is the contr<br>\
of الرَّوَاحُ [inf. n. of رَاحَ]. (S.) Hence, in the<br>\
Kur [lxviii. 22], أَنِ اغْدُوا عَلَى حَرْثِكُمْ [Saying,<br>\
Go ye forth early, &amp;c., to your land&#39;s produce]:<br>\
and the saying of a poet,<br>\
وَالطَّيْرُ فِى وُكُنَاتِهَا ↓ وَقَدْ أَغْتَدِى<br>\
[And sometimes, or often, I go forth early, &amp;c.,<br>\
while the birds are in their nests]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Afterwards, by reason of frequency of use, it<br>\
became employed as meaning He went, or went<br>\
away, or departed, at any time. (Mgh, * Msb,<br>\
TA.) Hence the saying, (Mgh, Msb,) of the<br>\
Prophet, (Msb,) in a trad., (Mgh,) اُغْدُ يَا أُنَيْسُ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) meaning Depart then, O (??)<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Freytag bas erroneously assigned to<br>\
it another meaning, i. e. “ Nutrivit ” misled by<br>\
his finding تَغْدُوْ put for تَغْذُو in art. طلى in the<br>\
CK.] ―<br>\
-b4-  غَدِىَ: see 5.<br>\
2<br>\
غَدَّيْتُهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَغْدِيَةٌ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) I fed him with the meal called غَدَآء [q. v.].<br>\
(S, * Msb, K.)<br>\
3<br>\
غَاْدَوَ see 1, first sentence. One says, أَنَا أُعَادِيهِ<br>\
وَأُرَاوِحُهُ expl. in the first paragraph of art. روح.<br>\
5<br>\
تغدّى [He ate the meal called غَدَآء, q. v.;<br>\
properly,] he ate in the first part of the day; (S,<br>\
Msb, * K;) as also ↓ غَدِىَ, (IKtt, K, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
غَدًا. (TK: but in the TA written غداء.) When<br>\
it is said to thee, تَغَدَّ [Eat thou the غَدَآء], thou<br>\
sayest, مَا بِى مِنْ تَغَدٍّ [I have no desire for eating<br>\
the غَدَآء]; and not مَا بِى غَدَآءٌ, for [the] غَدَآء is<br>\
the meal itself. (S, Msb. See also 5 in art. عشو.)<br>\
تَغَدَّى فِى رَمَضَانَ means تَسَحَّرَ [i. e. He ate the<br>\
meal, or drank the draught of milk, called سَحُور,<br>\
q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تَغَدَّتِ الإِبِلُ means The<br>\
camels pastured in the first part of the day.<br>\
(AHn, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِغْتَدَوَ see 1, first and second sentences.<br>\
[10. استغدى accord. to Freytag is syn. with<br>\
تَغَدَّى; but for this I do not find any authority.]<br>\
غَدٌ, meaning The morrow, the day next after<br>\
the present day, (Msb,) is originally ↓غَدْوٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) the و being elided, (S, Msb,) without<br>\
any substitution, (S,) and the د being made a<br>\
letter of declinability. (Msb.) And one says<br>\
غَدًا meaning [I will do such a thing, &amp;c.,] tomorrow: and بَعْدَ غَدٍ the day after to-morrow.<br>\
(MA.) See also غَدَاةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  And its signification<br>\
has been extended so that it is applied to a remote<br>\
time that is expected, (Msb, TA,) and to a near<br>\
time. (Nh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is not used in its complete<br>\
form except in poetry: (Nh, TA:) Lebeed, (S,<br>\
TA,) or Dhu-r-Rummeh, (TA,) has thus used it<br>\
in his saying,<br>\
وَمَا النَّاسُ إِلَّا كَالدِّيَارِ وَأَهْلُهَا<br>\
بَلَاقِعُ ↓ بِهَا يَوْمَ حَلُّوهَا وَغَدْوًا<br>\
[And mankind are no other than the like of dwellings, the occupants thereof being in them daring<br>\
the day in which they have alighted in them, and<br>\
to-morrow they are vacant]: (S, TA:) or, accord.<br>\
to the M, one says, هٰذَا عَدُكَ and ↓ هٰذَا غَدْوُكَ<br>\
[This is thy morrow]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It has no diminutive. (Sb, S, in art. امس.)<br>\
غَدْوٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in there<br>\
places.<br>\
غَدَاةٌ: see غُدْوَةٌ, in four places: though [properly] fem., and not heard as made mase., it may<br>\
be made mase. if meant to be understood as signifying the “ first part of the day: ” (IAmb,<br>\
Msb:) it is originally غَدَوَةٌ, because its pl. is<br>\
غَدَوَاتٌ. (IHsh, TA.) One says, ↓ آتِيكَ غَدَاةَ غَدٍ<br>\
[I will come to thee in the early part of the morning, &amp;c., of to-morrow]. (S, TA.) بِالْغَدَاةِ وَالْعَشِىِّ<br>\
in the Kur [vi. 52 and xviii. 27] means After the<br>\
prayer of daybreak and [after] the prayer of [the<br>\
period of the afternoon called] the عَصْر: or,<br>\
accord. to some, [it means in the morning and the<br>\
evening, or rather in the forenoon and the afternoon, for they say that] it denotes constancy of<br>\
religious service: Ibn-&#39;Ámir and Aboo-&#39;Abd-erRahmán Es-Sulamee read وَالْعَشِىِّ ↓ بِالْغُدْوَةِ; but<br>\
the former is the common reading; and A &#39;Obeyd<br>\
says, we think that they read thus following the<br>\
handwriting, for it is written in all the copies of<br>\
the Kur-án with و like الصَّلَوة and الزَّكَوة, and<br>\
this is not an indication of the reading [which<br>\
they have adopted], as the و in الصلوة and الزكوة<br>\
is not pronounced [otherwise than as an] of prolongation except that it requires the fet-hah that<br>\
follows to be uttered with a somewhat broad<br>\
sound]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  هُوَ ابْنُ غَدَاتَيْنِ means He is<br>\
a son of two days [i. e. he is two days old]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  The dim. is ↓ غُدَيَّةٌ: (TA:) or this is the<br>\
dim. of ↓ غُدْوَةٌ: (EM p. 56:) one says, أَرْكَبُ<br>\
إِلَيْهِ غُدَيَّةً [I will ride to him, or it, in a short<br>\
period of an early part of a morning, &amp;c.]: and<br>\
one says also, ↓ ذَتَيْتُهُ غُدَيَّانَاتٍ [I came to him, or<br>\
it, in short periods of early parts of mornings,<br>\
&amp;c.]; an anomalous [pl.] dim. like عُشَيَّانَات;<br>\
both of which are mentioned by Sb. (TA.)<br>\
غَدْوَةٌ A journey in the first part of the day:<br>\
[an inf. n. un. of غَدَا:] opposed to رَوْحَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next paragraph. ―<br>\
-b3-  And see غَدَآءٌ.<br>\
غُدْوَةٌ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) and ↓ غَدْوَةٌ, said by<br>\
MF to be well known, and ↓ غِدْوَةٌ, said by him<br>\
to be rare, or disapproved, (TA,) The early part<br>\
of the morning; the first part of the day; (K;)<br>\
or the period between the time of the prayer of<br>\
daybreak and sunrise; (S, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ غَدَاةٌ, and ↓ غَدِيَّةٌ, (K, TA,) the last [in the CK<br>\
غَدْيَةِ, but correctly] a dial. var. of غُدْوَةٌ, like<br>\
ضَحِيَّةٌ a dial. var. of ضَحْوَةٌ: (IAar, TA:) or<br>\
↓ غَدَاةٌ is syn. with ضَحْوَةٌ [meaning the early<br>\
part of the forenoon, after sunrise; accord. to<br>\
some, when the sun is yet low; or, accord. to<br>\
others, when the sun is somewhat high]: (Msb:)<br>\
[it may therefore be generally rendered morning,<br>\
before, or after, sunrise:] the pls. are غُدًى, which<br>\
is pl. of غُدْوَةٌ; (S, Msb, TA;) and غَدَوَاتٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K, TA,) which is pl. of ↓ غَدَاةٌ; (S, Msb,<br>\
TA;) and ↓ غُدُوٌّ, (K, TA,) which is a pl. of غُدْوَةٌ,<br>\
formed by rejecting the ة [of the sing.], or, accord.<br>\
to the M, an anomalous pl. of ↓ غَدَاةٌ, or, as J<br>\
says, [in the S,] referring to the phrase بِالْغَدُوِّ<br>\
وَالْآصَالِ, in the Kur [vii. 204 and xiii. 16 and<br>\
xxiv. 36], بِالغُدُوِّ there means بِالغَدَوَاتِ, and is<br>\
a verb [i. e. an inf. n.] used to denote the time,<br>\
as [is طُلُوع] in the saying طُلُوعَ الشَّمْسِ<br>\
meaning فِى وَقْتِ طُلُوعِ الشمس; (TA;) and<br>\
غَدِيَّاتٌ, (IAar, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
غَدَياتٌ,]) which is pl. of ↓ غَدِيَّةٌ; (TA;) and<br>\
غَدَايَا, (K, TA,) which is likewise a pl. of ↓ غَدِيَّةٌ,<br>\
accord. to IAar, and, if so, regularly formed from<br>\
غَدَايِوُ, in the same manner as has already been<br>\
expl. in the case of عَشَايَا [pl. of عَشِيَّةٌ, q. v. voce<br>\
عَشِىٌّ]; by some said to be a pl. of غُدْوَةٌ, but this<br>\
has been controverted by IHsh in the Expos. of<br>\
the “ Kaabeeyeh ” and by its commentator [&#39;AbdEl-Kádir] El-Baghdádee; (TA;) or غَدَايَا is<br>\
not used except in conjunction with عَشَايَا; (K,<br>\
TA;) one says, إِنِّى لَآتِيهِ بِالغَدَايَا وَالعَشَايَا [Verily<br>\
I come to him in the early parts of mornings and<br>\
in the late parts of evenings], for the purpose of<br>\
conformity. (S, TA.) Zj says that when غُدْوَة<br>\
means The بُكْرَة [or early part of the morning,<br>\
&amp;c.,] of the present day, or of a particular day,<br>\
it is imperfectly decl.: and AHei says that it is<br>\
thus accord. to the opinion commonly obtaining,<br>\
as is also بُكْرَة, each as being a generic proper<br>\
name, like أُسَامَةُ; and that when you mean to<br>\
generalize, you say, غُدْوَةٌ وَقْتُ نَشَاطٍ [An early<br>\
part of a morning is a time of briskness, liveliness,<br>\
or sprightliness]; and when you mean to particularize, لَأَسِيرَنَّ اللَّيْلَةَ إِلَى غُدْوَةَ [I will assuredly<br>\
journey to-night until the early part of the morning]: (TA:) [in the latter case also] one says,<br>\
أَتَيْتُهُ غُدْوَةَ [I came to him in the early part of the<br>\
morning of this, or of a particular, day]; غدوة<br>\
being here imperfectly decl. because it is determinate, like سَحَرَ; but it is of those adv. ns. that<br>\
may be used otherwise than as adv. ns.: you say,<br>\
سِيرَ عَلَى فَرَسِكَ غُدْوَةَ and غُدْوَةً [i. e. Journeying<br>\
was performed on thy horse, or mare, in the غُدْوَة<br>\
of this, or of a particular, day, and in a غُدْوَة,]<br>\
and غُدْوَةٌ and غُدْوَةٌ [i. e. the journey of the غُدْوَة<br>\
of this, or of a particular, day, and the journey<br>\
of a غُدْوَة, was performed (lit. was journeyed) on<br>\
thy horse, or mare, غُدْوَةُ and غُدْوَةٌ being for. مَسِيرَةُ<br>\
غُدْوَةَ and مَسِيرَةُ غُدْوَةٍ, like as شَهْرٌ in the Kur<br>\
xxxiv. 11 is for مَسِيرَةُ شَهْرٍ]; what is with tenween, of these, being indeterminate, and what is<br>\
without tenween being determinate. (S. [In one<br>\
of my copies of the S, سِرْ is put in the place of سِيرَ:<br>\
that the latter is the right is shown by the addition of غُدْوَةُ and غُدْوَةٌ; for each of these must be<br>\
what is termed نَائِبٌ عَنْ فَاعِلٍ i. e. a substitute for<br>\
an agent.]) See also غَدَاةٌ, in two places.<br>\
غِدْوَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
غَدَوِىٌّ: see غَدِىٌّ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Whatever [offspring]<br>\
is in [any of] the bellies of pregnant animals (AO,<br>\
K, TA) of camels and of sheep or goats: (AO,<br>\
TA:) or peculiarly of sheep or goats; (K, TA;)<br>\
thus in the dial. of the Prophet: (TA:) or it<br>\
[virtually, in a trad. mentioned in what follows,]<br>\
means the selling a camel, or other [animal], for<br>\
what the stallion begets: or the selling a sheep for<br>\
the offspring begotten by the ram: (K:) in all of<br>\
which senses غَذِىٌّ and غَذَوِىٌّ are [said to be]<br>\
syn.: (K in art. غذو:) or غَدَوِىٌّ, (TA,) or غَذَوِىٌّ,<br>\
or, as some relate a verse of El-Farezdak in which<br>\
it occurs, غَدَوِىٌّ, (S in art. غذو,) means the selling a thing for the offspring begotten by the ram<br>\
[or, as appears from what follows, by the stallioncamel] in that year: غَدَوِىٌّ being a rel. n. from<br>\
غَدٌ: as though they rendered one desirous by<br>\
saying, “Our camels will bring forth and we<br>\
will give thee to-morrow (غَدًا): ” (S in art. غذو,<br>\
and TA:) what is thus termed is forbidden in a<br>\
trad.: a man used to buy, for a camel or a she-goat or money, what was in the bellies of pregnant animals; and this is a hazardous proceeding,<br>\
and was therefore forbidden. (Nh, TA.) See also<br>\
art. غذو. ―<br>\
-b3-  And see عَدَوِيَّةٌ, in art. عدو.<br>\
غَدْيَانُ Eating the meal called غَدَآء: (S, K: *)<br>\
fem. غَدْيَا, of the measure فَعْلَى, applied to a<br>\
woman; (S;) or غَدْيَآءُ: (so in copies of the K:)<br>\
they are originally with و [in the place of the ى],<br>\
on the ground of preference, as is said in the M:<br>\
and غَدْيَانَةٌ is mentioned by Z, as applied to a<br>\
woman, coupled with عَشْيَانَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
غَدَآءٌ The morning-meal, that is eaten between<br>\
daybreak and sunrise; i. e. the meal, or repast,<br>\
of the غُدْوَة; (K;) or of the غَدَاة; (Msb;) the<br>\
meal, or repast, that is the contr. of the عَشآء:<br>\
(S:) [it may therefore be rendered breakfast:<br>\
but it is now commonly applied to dinner, which<br>\
is eaten soon after the prayer of noon, and which<br>\
is a lighter repast than the عَشَآء, i. e. supper:]<br>\
الغدوة [app. ↓ الغَدْوَةُ] as meaning الغَدَآءُ is vulgar:<br>\
(TA voce عَشْوَةٌ:) the pl. of غَدَآءٌ is أَغْذِيَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
And The [meal, or the draught of milk, called]<br>\
سَحُور is thus termed; because it is to the person<br>\
fasting the like of what it is to him who is not<br>\
fasting. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The pasture of camels in<br>\
the first part of the day. (TA.)<br>\
غُذُوٌّ: see غُدْوَةٌ.<br>\
غَدِىٌّ Of, or relating to, the morrow; the<br>\
rel. n. from غَدٌ; as also ↓ غَدَوىٌّ; (S, K;) the<br>\
latter allowable. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also عَدَويَّةٌ, in art.<br>\
عدو.<br>\
غَدِيَّةٌ: see its syn. غُدْوَةٌ, in three places.<br>\
غُدَيَّةٌ: and see غَدَاةٌ, last sentence.<br>\
غُدَيَّانَاتٌ: see غَدَاةٌ, last sentence.<br>\
الغَادِى The lion: (K, TA:) because he goes<br>\
forth in the early part of the morning against the<br>\
prey. (TA.)<br>\
غَادِيَةٌ A cloud that rises (S, K) in the صَبَاح (S)<br>\
or in the غُدْوَة (K) [i. e. in the first part of the<br>\
day]: or a rain of the [period of the morning<br>\
called] غَدَاة: (K, TA:) thus says Lh: the pl. is<br>\
غَوَادٍ. (TA.) [See a verse in the Ham p. 429.]<br>\
مَغْدًى and ↓ مَغْدَاةٌ [A place to which people go,<br>\
or to which they return, in the period of the morning called غُدْوَة; opposed to مَرَاحٌ and مَرَاحَةٌ]. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence] one says, مَا تَرَكَ فُلَانٌ مِنْ أَبِيهِ مَغْدًى<br>\
وَلَا مَرَاحًا, and وَلَا مَرَاحَةً ↓ مَغْدَاةً, expl. in art.<br>\
