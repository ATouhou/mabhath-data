غَرَّهُ, aor. يَغُرُّ, inf. n. غُرُورٌ (Fr, S, Msb, K)<br>\
and غَرٌّ, (Az, K,) which latter is preferable to the<br>\
former, [though less common,] because the inf. n.<br>\
of a trans. verb is scarcely ever of the measure<br>\
فُعُولٌ, (Az,) and غِرَّةٌ (Lh, K) and غَرَرٌ, (IKtt,<br>\
TA,) He (the devil, TA) deceived him; beguiled<br>\
him; (S, K;) made him to desire what was vain,<br>\
or false. (K.) You say غَرَّتْهُ الدُّنْيَا The world<br>\
deceived him, or beguiled him, by its finery, or<br>\
show, or pomp. (Msb.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[lxxxii. 6], مَا غَرَّكَ بِرَبِّكَ What hath deceived thee,<br>\
and led thee into error, so that thou hast neglected<br>\
what was incumbent on thee to thy Lord? (Aboo-Is-hák:) or what hath deceived thee respecting<br>\
thy Lord, and induced thee to disobey Him, and to<br>\
feel secure from his punishment? (TA:) or what<br>\
hath deceived thee, and emboldened thee to disobey<br>\
thy Lord? (Bd. [But see بِ as syn. with عَنْ.])<br>\
مَا غَرَّكَ بِفُلَانٍ signifies [What hath deceived thee,<br>\
and emboldened thee against such a one? or] how<br>\
is it that thou art emboldened against such a<br>\
one? (As, S, Msb, TA.) [See also 4.] And مَنْ<br>\
غَرَّكَ بِفُلَانٍ, (TA,) and مِنْ فُلَانٍ, (S, TA,) Who<br>\
hath made thee to pursue a course without being<br>\
rightly directed, or a course not plain, (مَنْ أَوْطَأَكَ<br>\
عُشْوَةً, S, TA,) with respect to such a one, (S,) or<br>\
with respect to the case of such a one? (TA. [See<br>\
again 4.]) [Also غُرَّ مِنْ فُلَانٍ, i. e. غُرَّ غُرُورًا صَادِرًا<br>\
مِنْ فُلَانٍ, He was deceived by such a one; he was<br>\
deceived with deceit proceeding from such a one.<br>\
See غَرِيرٌ, as syn. with مَغْرُورٌ.] And غَرَّ فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا<br>\
Such a one exposed such a one to perdition or destruction [app. by deceiving him]. (TA. [See<br>\
also 2, and 4.]) Also Such a one acted with such<br>\
a one in a manner resembling the slaying with the<br>\
edge of the sword. (TA. [See 3 in art. عطو.])<br>\
-A2-  غَرَّ فَرْخَهُ, (S, O, K,) aor.<br>\
غَرُ3َ, (S, O,) inf. n. غَرٌّ<br>\
(S, O, K) and غِرَارٌ, (O, K, [or the latter is inf. n.<br>\
of غَارَّ only,]) It (a bird, S, O, K, * or a pigeon,<br>\
TA) fed its young one with its bill: (S, O, K:)<br>\
and أُنْثَاهُ ↓ غارّ, (As, S, K,) inf. n. غِرَارٌ (S) or مُغَارَّةٌ,<br>\
(TA,) he (the [collared turtle-dove called] قُمْرِىّ)<br>\
fed his female with his bill. (As, S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, in a trad., كَانَ يَغُرُّ عَلِيًّا (O, TA) بِالعِلْمِ<br>\
(TA) (assumed tropical:)  He (the Prophet) used to nourish &#39;Alee<br>\
with knowledge like as the bird feeds its young one.<br>\

youth, or young man, K) was inexperienced in<br>\

That was in [the time of] my inexperience and<br>\
youth. (S.) [See also 8.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And غَرَّ, (K,)<br>\
see. pers. غَررْتَ, (IAar, T, TA,) aor. يَغَرُّ, with<br>\
fet-h, (IAar, T, K,) inf. n. غَرَارَةٌ, (IAar, T, TA,)<br>\
He acted in a youthful or childish manner:<br>\
(IAar, T, TA:) or he so acted after having<br>\
soundness of judgment, produced by experience.<br>\
(Sgh, K.) But this is at variance with what J<br>\
cites from Fr, in art. شد, that the aor. of an<br>\
intrans. verb of this class of the measure فَعَلَ,<br>\
should be of the measure يَفْعِلُ, with kesr to the<br>\
ع. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  غَرَّ, (IAar, IKtt, K,) in one place<br>\
written by IAar غَرِرَ, to show that it is of the<br>\
measure فَعِلَ, and that the sec. pers. is غَرِرْتَ,<br>\
(TA,) aor. يَغَرُّ, (IAar, IKtt, K,) inf. n. غَرَرٌ<br>\
(IAar, K) and غُرَّةٌ, (IAar, IKtt, K,) or the<br>\

subst., (TA,) and غَراَرَةٌ, (K,) He (a horse, IAar,<br>\
IKtt, and a camel, IAar) had what is termed a<br>\

became white. (IAar, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  غَرَّ, aor. يَغَرُّ, He<br>\
(a man) became eminent, or noble. (TA.) ―<br>\

-A6-  غَرَّ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
المَآءَ He poured upon him, or it, the water: like<br>\

thy watering-trough. (TA.) And غُرَّ فِى سِقَائِكَ<br>\
Fill thou thy skin by putting it into the water and<br>\
throwing the water into it with thy hand, not abstaining until thou fillest it: thus as related by Az<br>\
accord. to the usage of the desert-Arabs. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
غرّر بِنَفْسِهِ, (S, K, TA,) and بِمَالِهِ, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. تَغْرِيرٌ and تَغِرَّةٌ, (S, K,) He exposed himself,<br>\
(K, TA,) and his property, (TA,) to perdition,<br>\
or destruction, or loss, (K, TA,) without knowing<br>\
it: (TA:) he endangered, jeoparded, hazarded,<br>\
or risked, himself, (S, TA,) [and his property,]<br>\
and was negligent, or heedless, of the end, issue, or<br>\
result, of an affair. (TA.) [See also 1.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
غُزِّرَ He (a horse) was marked with a غُرَّة [i. e.<br>\
a star, or blaze, or white mark, on the forehead<br>\
or face]: you say بِمَ غُرِّرَ فَرَسُكَ With what kind<br>\
of غُرَّة is thy horse marked? and the owner<br>\
answers, With a شاَدِخَة, or with a وَتِيرَة, &amp;c.<br>\
(Mubtekir El-Aarábee, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  غَرَّرَتْ ثَنِيَّتَا الغُلاَمٍ<br>\
The central incisors of the boy showed their points<br>\
for the first time: (S:) or غرّر الغُلاَمُ the first<br>\
of the teeth of the boy showed its point; as though<br>\
the غُرَّة, i. e. whiteness, of his teeth appeared: and<br>\
غَرَّرَتْ أَسْنَانُ الصَّبِىِّ the teeth of the boy were disposed to grow, and came forth. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
hence, (TA,) غَرَّرَتِ الطَّيْرُ The birds desired, or endeavoured, to fly, and raised their wings. (K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A4-  غرّر القِرْبَةَ (Sgh, K, TA) and السِّقَآءَ (TA)<br>\

milked, drew up her milk, and would not yield it<br>\
plentifully until it collected again in her udder in<br>\
the interval before the next period of milking.<br>\
(Az.) [This signification of the verb is said in<br>\
the TA to be tropical: but I rather think it to be<br>\
proper; as the next is derived from it.] ―<br>\

غارَّت السُّوقُ, aor. تُغَارُّ, (AZ, S,) inf. n. غِرَارٌ, (AZ,<br>\
S, K,) (tropical:)  The market became stagnant, or dull,<br>\

4<br>\
اغرّهُ He, or it, emboldened him, or encouraged him; [by deceiving him;] syn. أَجْسَرَهُ: so<br>\
says AHeyth; and he cites the following verse:<br>\
أَغَرَّ هِشَامًا مِنْ أَخِيهِ ابْنِ أُمِّهِ<br>\
قَوَادِمُ صَأْنٍ يَسَّرَتْ وَرَبِيعُ<br>\
meaning [The teats of sheep that have yielded<br>\
abundance of milk and of young, and spring<br>\
herbage, i. e.] the abundance of his sheep and<br>\
their milk, have emboldened Hishám against his<br>\
brother, the son of his mother, [to pursue a wrong<br>\
course towards him, and] to forsake him, thinking<br>\
himself in dependent of him: the poet makes قوادم<br>\
to belong to sheep, whereas they properly belong<br>\
to the udders of camels, using the word metaphorically. (TA.) [But I incline to think that<br>\
the أَ in أَغَرَّ is the interrogative particle, and that<br>\
its explanation is أَجَسَّرَ, with the same particle;<br>\
and the more so as I have not found any authority, if this be not one, for أَجْسَرَ in the sense of<br>\
جَسَّرَ: so that the meaning of the verse is, Have<br>\
the teats, &amp;c.? and it shows that غَرَّهُ مِنْهُ, not<br>\
أَغَرَّهُ, means جَسَّرَهُ عَلَيْهِ, like غَرَّهُ بِهِ. See 1.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also He caused him to fall into peril, danger,<br>\
jeopardy, hazard, or risk. (TA.) [But perhaps<br>\
this meaning is also derived from a misunderstanding of the verse quoted above. See again 1.]<br>\
8<br>\
اغترّ He became deceived, or beguiled; (S,<br>\
K;) made to desire what was vain, or false;<br>\
(K;) بِشَىْءٍ by a thing. (S.) [See also 10.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
He was negligent, inattentive, inadvertent, inconsiderate, heedless, or unprepared; (S, K;) he<br>\
thought himself secure, and therefore was not on<br>\
his guard. (Msb.) [See again 10.]<br>\
-A2-  اغترَهُ He,<br>\
or it, came to him when he was negligent, inadvertent, heedless, or unprepared; (T, S, TA;) as<br>\
also ↓ استغرّهُ: (T, K, TA:) or he sought to avail<br>\
himself of his negligence, inadvertence, heedlessness,<br>\
or unpreparedness; as also اغترّبِهِ. (TA.)<br>\

in skin, (O, * S,) accord. to Lth, from fatness,<br>\

كَسْرٌ مَتَثَنٍّ, (K,) and مَكْسِرٌ: (S, * O:) pl. غُرُورٌ.<br>\
(S, TA.) [Hence,] غُرُورُ الفَخِذَيْنِ The furrows<br>\

this I see no reason.]) And hence طَوَيْتُهُ عَلَى غَرِّهِ<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  I left him as he was, without making<br>\
known his case: a saying proverbially used in<br>\
relation to one who is made to rely upon his own<br>\
opinion. (Har p. 233. [In Freytag&#39;s Arab<br>\
Prov., ii. 38, it is not well rendered nor well explained.]) Hence also the saying of &#39;Áïsheh,<br>\
respecting her father, mentioned in a trad., فَرَدَّ<br>\
نَشَرَ الإِسْلَامِ عَلَى غَرِّهِ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  And he reduced what<br>\

or to the twentieth part thereof: (K, T:) or it<br>\
means a slave of the best sort. (Mgh.) The Rájiz<br>\

عرض; &amp;c.) [And عَنْ غِرَّةٍ In consequence of inadvertence: see an ex. in a verse cited voce زَلَقٌ.]<br>\
Also Inexperience in affairs. (S.) غِرَّةٌ and غَرَارَةٌ<br>\

sale of hazard, or risk; (S, Mgh, Msb;) of<br>\
which it is unknown whether the thing will be or<br>\
not; (Mgh;) such as the sale of fish in the water,<br>\
and of birds in the air: (S, Mgh:) or, accord. to<br>\

prov., respecting the hastening a thing before its<br>\
time, سَبَقَ دِرَّتُهُ غِرَارَهُ [lit., His abundant flow of<br>\
milk preceded his paucity thereof]: (As:) or سَبَقَ<br>\
دِرَّتَهُ غِرَارُهُ [lit., his paucity of milk preceded his<br>\
abundance thereof; agreeably with an explanation<br>\
of Z, who says that it is applied to him who does<br>\
evil before he does good: see Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\

deficient form; but it is the form specially sanctioned by the Kur-án]: or the replying by saying<br>\
عَلَيْكَ, not عَليْكُمْ. (K.) This is said in explanation of a trad., لاَ غِرَارَ فِى صَلَاةٍ وَلَا تَسْلِيمٍ [There<br>\
shall be no deficiency in prayer, nor in salutation]:<br>\
but accord. to one relation, it is لا غرار فى صلاة<br>\
ولا تَسْلِيمَ, meaning, that the person praying shall<br>\
not salute nor be saluted: in the former case,<br>\
تسليم is an adjunct to صلاة: in the latter, it is<br>\
an adjunct to غرار, so that the meaning is, There<br>\
shall be no deficiency nor salutation in prayer.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\

length of a month. (So in some copies of the S,<br>\
and in the O: in other copies of the S, لَبِثَ القَوْمُ<br>\

(S, K) of arrows (S) are fashioned, (S, K,) in<br>\

fashioned his arrow-heads according to] one model,<br>\
or pattern. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And The حَدّ [app. meaning point, or perhaps the edge of the iron head or<br>\

which one is deceived, of worldly goods or advantages: (S:) or the former signifies the devil,<br>\
specially; (Yaakoob, S, K;) because he deceives<br>\
men by false promises and by inspiring hopes;<br>\
or because he urges a man to do those things<br>\
which are causes of his being loved but which<br>\
are followed by that which grieves him: (TA:)<br>\
and this last sense it has, accord. to ISk, in the<br>\
Kur xxxi. 33 and xxxv. 5: (S:) also the present<br>\
world; (K;) as an epithet in which the quality<br>\
of a subst. predominates: and this sense is assigned<br>\
to it by some as used in the passages of the Kur-án<br>\
to which reference has just been made. (TA.) [It<br>\
is masc. and fem., agreeably with analogy.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\

sense of مَغْرُورٌ [I am deceived by thee]. (TA.)<br>\
And ↓ مَغْرُورٌ signifies also A man who marries to<br>\
a woman in the belief that she is free, and finds<br>\
her to be a slave. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also غِرٌّ, in three<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b3-  It is said in a prov., أَنَا غَرِيرُكَ مِنْ هٰذَا<br>\
الأَمْرِ, meaning I am one possessing knowledge in<br>\
this affair so that when thou askest me of it I will<br>\
inform thee respecting it without being prepared<br>\
for it and without consideration: so says AZ:<br>\
and Z says the like; i. e. I [am one who] will<br>\
answer thee if thou ask me unexpectedly respecting<br>\
this affair by reason of the soundness of my knowledge of the true state of the case: or [it means<br>\
I am a deceived informant of thee respecting this<br>\
affair; for] as As says, the meaning is, thou art<br>\
not deceived by me, but I am the person deceived;<br>\
the case being this, that false information came to<br>\
me, and I acquainted thee with it, and it was not<br>\
as I told thee; I having only related what I had<br>\
heard. (TA.) And one says, أَنَا غَرِيرُكَ مِنْهُ i. e.<br>\
I caution thee [or I am thy cautioner] against<br>\
him; (K, TA:) [i. e.,] مِنْ فُلَانٍ [against such a<br>\
one]; (S, O;) meaning, as Aboo-Nasr says in the<br>\
“ Kitáb el-Ajnás,” [that] there shall not happen<br>\
to thee, from him, that whereby thou shalt be<br>\
deceived; (S, O, TA;) as though he said, I am<br>\
thy surety, or sponsor, for that. (AM, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\

to be in fear: (S, K, TA:) like عَيْشٌ أَبْلَهُ: (TA:)<br>\
pl. غُرَّانٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Hence, perhaps; or from<br>\
الغِرَّةُ [app. as meaning “ inexperience ”], which is<br>\
sometimes approved; (Har p. 607;) or because<br>\
it [sometimes] deceives; (TA;) غَرِيرٌ also signifies (tropical:)  Good disposition or nature. (S, O, K,<br>\
