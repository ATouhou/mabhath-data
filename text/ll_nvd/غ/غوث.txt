غوّث, (S, K,) inf. n. تَغْوِيثٌ; (K;) and<br>\
↓ استغاث; (TA;) He cried out, (TA,) and said,<br>\
(S, K,) ↓ وَا غَوْثَاهُ (S, K, TA) [Alas! a cry for<br>\
aid, or succour! also pronounced وا غَوْثَاهِ (accord.<br>\
to one of my copies of the S) and وا غَوْثَاهْ]. You<br>\
say, ضُرِبَ فُلَانٌ فَغَوَّثَ Such a one was beaten, and<br>\
cried وا غوثاه. (TA.) This is declared by the<br>\
leading grammarians to be the primary signification of غوّث: then they used it as meaning He<br>\
cried out, or called, desiring, or demanding, aid,<br>\
or succour. (MF.)<br>\
-A2-  See also غَوِيثٌ.<br>\
4<br>\
اغاثهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِغَاثَةٌ (Msb, K)<br>\
and ↓ مَغُوثَةٌ [which is anomalous], (K,) He aided,<br>\
or succoured, him; (Msb;) He (i. e. God, Msb)<br>\
removed from him trouble, or affliction: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) ↓ غَاثَهُ, aor. يَغِيثُهُ, is used in the sense of<br>\
اغاثهُ, but is rare, and is said [by some] to be<br>\
from الغَيْثُ, not الإِغَاثَةُ: غاثهُ, aor. يَغُوثُهُ, is mentioned by Az as not heard by him from any one;<br>\
but ISd mentions غاثهُ, inf. n. غَوْثٌ and غِيَاثٌ,<br>\
though saying that اغاثهُ is more approved. (TA.)<br>\
And one says also, أَغَاثَنَا المَطَرُ (assumed tropical:)  [The rain gave<br>\
us relief]. (Msb.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَغَاوَثُوا, accord. to Freytag, appears to be<br>\
used in the Deewán of the Hudhalees as signifying They said, one to another, وَا غَوْثَاهُ:<br>\
-A2-  and<br>\
تغاوث as syn. with أَغَاثَ.]<br>\

استغاثهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and استغاث بِهِ,<br>\
(O, Msb, TA,) the latter disallowed by some,<br>\
but used by Sb, (TA,) He sought, desired, or<br>\
demanded, aid, or succour, of, or by means of,<br>\
him, or it; he sought, &amp;c., [or called for,] his<br>\
aid, or succour. (O, MF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2.<br>\
[Hence, استغاث العُودُ (assumed tropical:)  The lute sent forth plaintive sounds: a modern phrase.]<br>\
غَوْثٌ and ↓ غُوَاثٌ and ↓ غَوَاثٌ, (S, K,) the last<br>\
deviating from the common course of speech, (K,<br>\
TA,) with respect to analogy, as will be seen<br>\
from what follows, (TA,) A cry for aid, or succour. (S, K, KL, PS.) One says, أَجَابَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
↓ دُعَآءَهُ وغُوَاثَهُ and ↓ غَوَاثَهُ [God answered his<br>\
prayer, and his cry for aid]. (Fr, S.) ↓ غَوَاثٌ<br>\
is said by Fr to be the only word significant of<br>\
a sound, or cry, having fet-h [to the first letter];<br>\
other words of this kind being with damm, as<br>\
بُكَآءٌ and دُعَآءٌ, or with kesr, as نِدَآءٌ and صِيَاحٌ.<br>\

the paragraph here following.<br>\
غِيَاثٌ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) in which the و is<br>\
changed into ى because of the kesreh preceding<br>\
it, (S,) a form disapproved by some of the lexicographers, but several others assign to it priority,<br>\
(MF,) a subst. from أَغَاثَهُ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) as<br>\
also ↓ غَوَاثٌ, ascribed by Ibn-Hajar to the majority,<br>\
and ↓ غُوَاثٌ, mentioned on the authority of Aboo-Dharr, (MF,) and ↓ غَوْثٌ; (Msb;) signifying<br>\
Aid, or succour; (Msb;) or deliverance from<br>\
difficulty, distress, or adversity, and [from] revenge; and aid to release from difficulties, distresses, or adverse circumstances. (MF.) In the<br>\
T, الغِيَاثُ is expl. as signifying That with which<br>\
God aids, or succours, one. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And غِيَاثٌ<br>\
signifies also An aider, or a succourer: you say,<br>\
فُلَانٌ غِيَاثُنَا Such a one is our aider, or succourer;<br>\
i. q. ↓ مُغِيثُنَا: (TA in art. نور:) and God is said<br>\
to be غِيَاثُ المُسْتَغِيثِينَ [The Aider of the seekers<br>\
of aid]. (O.) ―<br>\

perhaps inf. ns., the former like دَبِيبٌ &amp;c.,] Vehemence of running (شِدَّةُ عَدْوٍ). (O, K.)<br>\
مُغِيثٌ: see غِيَاثٌ, last sentence but one.<br>\

مَغَاوِثُ Waters: (O, K:) said to be one of<br>\
those plurals that have no singulars. (TA.)<br>\
يَغُوثُ A certain idol which belonged to [the<br>\
tribe of] Medhhij: (Zj, ISd, K, TA:) or a certain good man, who lived between [the times of]<br>\
Adam and Noah, and of whom, after his death,<br>\
was made an image, which, after a long time,<br>\
became an object of worship; like وَدٌّ and سُوَاعٌ<br>\
and يَغُوقُ and نَسْرٌ, mentioned therewith in the<br>\
Kur lxxi. 22 and 23. (Bd.)<br>\
