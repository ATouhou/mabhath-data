غُدَّ and<br>\
غَدَّ, said of a camel: see 4.<br>\
2<br>\
غُدِّدَ: see 4.<br>\
-A2-  غَدَّدَ, inf. n. تَغْدِيدٌ, He took<br>\
his [غُدَّة, i. e.] lot, portion, or share. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَغَدَّ (S, A, O, L, Msb, K) and أُغِدَّ, (O, L,<br>\
K,) and ↓ غُدَّ, (Az, O, L, K,) this last heard by<br>\
Az from the Arabs, (L,) [in the CK ↓ غَدَّ, but<br>\
(though the phrase غُدَّتْ إِبِلُهُمْ occurs there afterwards) غُدَّ may be less correct than غَدَّ, for the<br>\
part. n. of the former was disallowed by As,] and<br>\
↓ غُدِّدَ, (Az, O, K,) He (a camel) had the disease<br>\
termed غُدَّة [q. v.]; (Az, S, O, L, Msb, K;) or<br>\
had غُدَد [pl. of غُدَّةٌ] between the flesh and the<br>\
skin. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (A,) أَغَدَّ signifies also (tropical:)  He<br>\
(a man, As, S, A, O) was, or became, angry, (As,<br>\
S, O, L,) or swollen by reason of anger, as though<br>\
he were a camel having the disease termed غُدَّة:<br>\
(A:) and أَغَدَّ عَلَيْهِ he was angry with him; (K;)<br>\
or he swelled against him and was angry with<br>\
him. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And أَغَدَّ القَوْمُ The people, or party,<br>\
had their camels affected with the disease termed<br>\
غُدَّة. (S, O, L, K.)<br>\
غَدٌ: see art. غدو.<br>\
غُدَّةٌ (IDrd, S, O, L, Msb, K) and ↓ غُدَدَةٌ (S,<br>\
O, L, K) [A ganglion; i. e.] any hard lump in<br>\
the tendinous parts; (L, K;) [a lump of] flesh<br>\
arising from disease, between the skin and the flesh,<br>\
which may be made to move about: (Msb:) and<br>\
any small nodous lump (عُقْدَة) in the body (IDrd,<br>\
O, L, K) of a man, (IDrd, O, L,) surrounded by<br>\
fat: (IDrd, O, L, K:) pl. غُدَدٌ [properly pl. of<br>\
غُدَّةٌ, and also a coll. gen. n. of which غُدَدَةٌ is the<br>\
n. un.]: (S, O, L, Msb, K:) غُدَّةٌ [is applied in<br>\
the present day to a ganglion: and a bubo: and<br>\
a wen: and all these may be meant by its being<br>\
said that it] also signifies a [swelling such as is<br>\
termed] سِلْعَة, (L, K,) overspread by fat. (L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And غُدَّةٌ signifies likewise The plague, or<br>\
pestilence, (طَاعُون,) in camels; (As, S, O, L, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ غَدَدٌ: (K:) or the same in camels as the<br>\
طاعون in man: (Msb:) it attacks them in the<br>\
groins, and seldom do they recover from it: (L:)<br>\
or it is only in the belly; (K, TA;) and when it<br>\
extends to the camel&#39;s نَحْر [or part where he is<br>\
stabbed, or stuck, when he is slaughtered], and<br>\
to his groin, or arm-pit, the epithet دَابِرٌ [so in the<br>\
TA, but in the O دَارِئٌ, which I believe to be the<br>\
right reading,] is applied to him: so says IAar:<br>\
(TA:) or it is also in the fat parts; (Lth, O, L;)<br>\
and between the flesh and the skin. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
What is between the fat and the hump [of the<br>\
camel]. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  Another signification of غُدَّةٌ is<br>\
A part, or portion, of property; (L, K;) as in<br>\
the saying, عَلَيْهِ غُدَّةٌ مِنْ مَالٍ [He owes a part,<br>\
or portion, of some property]: (L:) pl. غَدَائِدُ,<br>\
(L, K,) and, in some of the copies of the K, غِدَادٌ.<br>\
(TA.) And [these two pls.] غَدَائِدُ and غِدَادٌ<br>\
signify also Lots, portions, or shares: (L, K:)<br>\
thus, accord. to Fr, the former of them means in<br>\
a verse of Lebeed cited and expl. voce عَدِيدَةٌ;<br>\
but the reading better known is عَدَائِدُ: accord.<br>\
to Az, غَدَائِدُ in this instance signifies redundances. (L.)<br>\
غَدَدٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
غُدَدَةٌ: see غُدَّةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [The pl.] غَدَدَاتٌ is expl. by<br>\
AHeyth as signifying Redundances of fatness:<br>\
and redundances of goodly [fur, such as is termed]<br>\
وَبَر. (L.)<br>\
غَادٌّ: see مُغِدٌّ, in two places.<br>\
مُغَدٌّ: see the paragraph here following.<br>\
مُغِدٌّ A camel having the disease termed غُدَّةٌ;<br>\
(As, Az, S, O, L, K;) as also ↓ مُغَدٌّ (L) and<br>\
↓ مَغْدُودٌ, (Az, L, K,) or this is not said, (As, O,<br>\
K,) but it was heard by Az from the Arabs, (O,<br>\
L,) and ↓ مُغَدَّدٌ (Az, L) and ↓ غَادٌّ: (O, L, K:)<br>\
مُغِدٌّ, without ة, is also applied to a she-camel:<br>\
and its pl. is مَغَادُّ: (L:) the pl. of ↓ غَادٌّ is غِدَاذٌ.<br>\
(O, L, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  An angry man: (As,<br>\
S, L:) or swollen by reason of anger, (A, L,) as<br>\
though he were a camel having the disease termed<br>\
غُدَّة. (A.) One says, رَأَيْتُ فُلَانًا مُغِدًّا and<br>\
↓ مُسْمَغِدًّا (tropical:)  I saw such a one swollen with<br>\
anger. (L.)<br>\
مُغَدَّدٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مِغْدَادٌ (assumed tropical:)  A man, (S, O, L, K,) and a woman,<br>\
(O, L, K,) much, or often, in anger: (S, O, L,<br>\
K:) or always angry: (O, K:) or angry in disposition or nature. (O, L.)<br>\
مَغْدُودٌ: see مُغِدٌّ.<br>\
مُسْمَغِدٌّ: see مُغِدٌّ.<br>\
