her child to drink what is termed غَيْل, (S, K,<br>\
TA,) i. e. the milk of her who was compressed, or<br>\

تغيّل الشَّجَرُ The trees became tangled, or<br>\
abundant and dense, (As, S, K,) in their branches,<br>\
having leafy coverings or shades; as also ↓ أَغْيَلَ<br>\

اغتالهُ He did evil to him without his knowing whence it came so that he might prepare himself. (TA.) It is said in a trad., أَعُوذُ بِكَ أَنْ<br>\
أُغْتَالَ مِنْ تَحْتِى i. e. [I seek protection by Thee<br>\
from] my being the object of an event&#39;s befalling<br>\

اِسْتَغْيَلَتْ, said of a woman, a verb of<br>\
which the subst. is غِيلَةٌ [q. v.]: (K:) [accord. to<br>\
the context in the K, in which the meaning is not<br>\
clearly indicated, it seems to signify She suckled<br>\
her child while being compressed, or while pregnant; like أَغَالَتْ for أَغَالَتْ وَلَدَهَا; and this I<br>\
believe to be the right meaning: or] it signifies<br>\
she was compressed while suckling a child, or<br>\
while pregnant. (TK.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 5, first sentence.<br>\
غَيْلٌ: see غِيلَةٌ, first sentence, in two places.<br>\

-b2-  As some say, (Msb,) it signifies The milk<br>\

drink such milk. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Water running<br>\
upon the surface of the earth; (S, Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
K;) thus correctly, with fet-h; but ↓ غِيلٌ, with<br>\
kesr, is a dial. var. thereof, mentioned by ISd:<br>\
(TA:) both are said to signify water running<br>\
amid trees: (Ham p. 555:) IB says that the<br>\
former signifies thus; and that its pl. is غُيُولٌ:<br>\
and it is also said to signify water running in<br>\
rivers or rivulets, and in streamlets for irrigation:<br>\
(TA:) and by some, to signify water running<br>\
amid stones, in the interior of a valley. (Ham<br>\
ubi suprà.) It is said in a trad., that in the case<br>\
of that [produce] which is irrigated by the water<br>\
thus termed (مَا سُقِىَ بَالغَيْلِ, S, Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
TA, or غَيْلًا, Mgh) there shall be [given for the<br>\
poor-rate] the tenth; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, TA;)<br>\
and in the case of that which is irrigated by the<br>\
bucket, half of the tenth. (S, TA.) [See also an<br>\
ex. voce صُبَابَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And Any valley in which are<br>\
flowing springs: (K:) or a place in a collection<br>\
of tangled, or abundant and dense, trees, in which<br>\
is water running upon the surface of the earth:<br>\
(Lth, TA:) and any place in which is water,<br>\
(K, TA,) such as a valley and the like: (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ غِيلٌ, with kesr, signifies any valley in<br>\
which is water; and the pl. of this is أَغْيَالٌ [a pl.<br>\
of pauc.] and غُيُولٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also غِيلٌ.<br>\
-A3-<br>\
Also A plump, full, سَاعِد [or fore arm]; (S, O,<br>\
K;) and so ↓ مُغْتَالٌ: (K:) the latter said by<br>\
Fr to be applied to a wrist as meaning full<br>\
because from الغَوْلُ; but this saying is not valid,<br>\
as غَيْلٌ is found in the same sense. (IJ, TA.)<br>\
[See an ex. of the former in a verse cited voce<br>\
طَفْلٌ.] And A fat, big, boy; as also ↓ مُغْتَالٌ:<br>\
(K:) fem. of the former غَيْلَةٌ; (TA;) which is<br>\

or dense, state: (As, S, O:) or an abundance of<br>\
such trees, (K, TA,) not thorn-trees, amid which<br>\
one may conceal himself: (TA:) and ↓ غَيْلٌ<br>\
signifies the same: (K:) and the former, a<br>\
collection of reeds or canes, and of [the kind of<br>\
high, coarse, grass called] حَلْفَآء: (K:) and i. q.<br>\
أَجَمَةٌ [i. e. a collection, or an abundant collection,<br>\
of tangled, confused, or dense, trees, or of reeds<br>\
or canes]: (S, O, K) [and in like manner ↓ غَيْلَةٌ,<br>\
occurring in the Deewán of the Hudhalees, is<br>\
expl. by Freytag, as signifying “ saltus: ”] and<br>\
the place [meaning covert] of the lion: it may<br>\
not have the termination ة: the pl. is غُيُولٌ; (S,<br>\
O;) and غَيَايِيلُ is said to be an anomalous pl. of<br>\
غِيلٌ. (O and TA in art. عيل, voce عَيَّالٌ, q. v.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also غَيْلٌ, in two places.<br>\
غَيْلَةٌ: see غِيلَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A single act of<br>\
اِغْتِيَال [q. v. voce غِيلَةٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also غِيلٌ.<br>\

(TA.)<br>\
غِيلَةٌ and ↓ غَيْلٌ signify the same; (Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb); i. e. The compressing one&#39;s wife while she<br>\
is suckling: (Mgh, Msb:) thus expl. by AO as<br>\
stated by A&#39;Obeyd: (Mgh:) and thus the<br>\
former signifies accord. to El-&#39;Alkamee; and so<br>\
says Málik: or, accord. to El-Munáwee, it signifies the compressing one&#39;s wife while she is suckling<br>\
or pregnant: or, accord. to ISk, a woman&#39;s<br>\
suckling while pregnant: (from a marginal note<br>\
in a copy of the Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer of Es-Suyootee,<br>\
in explanation of a trad. mentioned in what here<br>\
follows, commencing with the words لَقَدْ هَمَمْتُ:)<br>\
and ↓ غَيْلٌ has this last signification (Mgh, TA)<br>\
accord. to Ks: (Mgh:) غِيلَةٌ is the subst. from<br>\
اِسْتَغْيَلَتْ: (K:) and IAth says that ↓ غَيْلَةٌ is a<br>\
dial. var. thereof; or, as some say, this denotes<br>\
a single act [of what is termed غِيلَة]; or the<br>\
pronunciation with fet-h is not allowable unless<br>\
with the elision of the ة. (TA.) One says,<br>\
أَضَرَّتِ الغِيلَةُ بِوَلَدِ فُلَانٍ, meaning His mother&#39;s<br>\
being compressed while she was suckling him [injured the child of such a one], and likewise his<br>\
mother&#39;s being pregnant while she was suckling<br>\
him. (S, O.) [But] in a trad. is related the<br>\
saying, (of the Prophet, O) “ Verily I had<br>\
intended to forbid الغِيلَة (S, Mgh, * O, Msb, K)<br>\
until I remembered that the Persians and the<br>\
Greeks practise it and it does not injure their<br>\
children. ” (Mgh, O, Msb.) [See also 4 in art.<br>\
فسد.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The act of deceiving, or beguiling:<br>\
(K:) and i. q. ↓ اِغْتِيَالٌ: (S, O, K: [see 8, and<br>\
غِيلَةٌ, as expl. in art. غول:]) accord. to Aboo-Bekr,<br>\
in the language of the Arabs it signifies the<br>\
causing evil, or slaughter, to come to another<br>\
from an unknown quarter. (TA.) One says,<br>\
قَتَلَهُ غِيلَةً, meaning He deceived, or, beguiled,<br>\
him, and went with him, or took him, to a place,<br>\
and slew him (S, O, K) when he reached it:<br>\
(S, O:) or he slew him at unawares. (Abu-l-<br>\
&#39;Abbás, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The شَقْشِقَة [or faucial bag<br>\
of the he-camel]. (IAar, K.)<br>\
أُمُّ غَيْلَانَ [in Pers. مُغَيْلَان] A species of the<br>\
[trees called] غِضَاه; (Mgh, Msb;) the [species of<br>\
lote-] trees called سِدْر; (S, O, K, TA;) the fruit<br>\
of which is said to be sweeter than honey: the<br>\
saying, of some, that it is with kesr to the غ,<br>\
and that it is thus called because the غِيلان [pl.<br>\
of غُولٌ] are often found before it, is rejected and<br>\
false: (TA:) Lth and ISh say that it is the<br>\
same as the طَلْح [q. v.]. (TA in art. طلح.)<br>\
غَيُولٌ, as stated by IJ, on the authority of<br>\
Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee, who had it from his<br>\
grandfather, is sing. of غُيُلٌ, (TA,) which is an<br>\
epithet applied to oxen, or bulls and cows, (AO,<br>\
IJ, O, K, TA, [نَفَرٌ in the CK being a mistake<br>\
for بَقَرٌ,]) and to camels, (K,) signifying Numerous: and also [in the K “ or ”] fat. (AO,<br>\
IJ, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, applied to anything, Alone;<br>\
solitary: pl. غُيُلٌ. (AA, TA.)<br>\
غَيِّلٌ, like سَيِّدٌ, (O, TA,) in the K ↓ غَيْلٌ, but<br>\
this latter is said by ISd to be of weak authority,<br>\
(TA,) applied to a garment, Wide, or ample.<br>\
(O, K, TA.) And so غَيِّلَةٌ applied to a land: (O,<br>\
TA: [mentioned also in art. غول:]) or, as some<br>\
say, غَيِّلٌ, thus applied, (O, TA,) but accord. to<br>\
the context in the K ↓ غَيْلٌ, (TA,) signifies Such<br>\
as one judges to be of little extent, though it is<br>\
far extending: (O, K, * TA:) and ذَاتُ غَوْلٍ, so<br>\
applied, has been mentioned in art. غول as having<br>\
this meaning. (TA.) And غَيِّلَةٌ applied to a<br>\
woman signifies Tall: (O, TA:) and so does<br>\
ذَاتُ غَوْلٍ. (TA in art. غول.)<br>\
الغَيَّالُ The lion: (K) or the lion that is in the<br>\
غِيل [or covert]. (O.)<br>\
غَائِلٌ Much, or abundant, dust or earth. (TA.)<br>\
غَائِلَةٌ Rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite,<br>\
that is covert, or concealed. (K.) And Evil, or<br>\
mischief; as also ↓ مَغَالَةٌ: (S, K:) thus in the<br>\
saying فُلَانٌ قَلِيلُ الغَائِلَةِ and ↓ المَغَالَةِ [Such a one<br>\
is a person of little evil or mischief]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\

child given to drink what is termed غَيْل: (S, * K:<br>\
[See 4:]) or suckled while its mother is pregnant.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
مُغْيَلٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مُغِيلٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and مُغْيِلٌ (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K) A woman giving her child to drink<br>\
what is termed غَيْل: (S, K: [see 4:]) or suckling<br>\
it while she is pregnant. (Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
مَغَالَةٌ: see غَائِلَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
مُغَيِّلٌ [in the CK مُغَيَّل] and ↓ مُتَغِيِّلٌ Continuing, or remaining fixed, or stationary, in the<br>\
غِيل [meaning thicket, or covert, in the CK غَيْل]:<br>\
and entering therein. (K, TA.)<br>\
مِغْيَالٌ A tree (شَجَرَةٌ) having tangled, or<br>\
abundant and dense, branches, with leafy coverings<br>\
or shades. (K.)<br>\
