غَذَّ, aor.<br>\
غَذِ3َ (S, O, L, K, &amp;c.) and<br>\
غَذُ3َ, (K,)<br>\
but the former aor. only is known, (MF,) inf. n.<br>\
غَدٌّ, (S, O, L,) It (a wound) flowed with what<br>\
was in it; as also ↓ اغذّ: (K:) or flowed with<br>\
thick purulent matter; (S, O;) as also ↓ اغذّ [and<br>\
غَثَّ] and اغثّ: (O, L:) or flowed with purulent<br>\
matter, thick or thin: (Az, O, L:) or became<br>\
swollen: (Lth, L, K:) or this is a mistake; the<br>\
true signification being that next preceding. (Az,<br>\
O, L.) You say, تَرَكْتُ جُرْحَهُ يَغِذُّ [I left his<br>\
wound flowing with thick, or thin, purulent matter]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also It (a vein) flowed with blood<br>\
without stopping; (O, L;) and so ↓ اغذّ. (L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [And, accord. to Freytag, as on the authority<br>\
of Meyd, He delayed, or loitered, and remained<br>\
behind, in (فِى) a journey.]<br>\
-A2-  And غَدَّهُ He<br>\
diminished, or impaired, to him; or made him to<br>\
lose; syn. نَقَصَهُ; (O, K;) as also مِنْهُ ↓ غَذْغَذَ.<br>\
(O, K.) You say, مَا غَذَذْتُكَ شَيْئًا i. e. مَا نَقَصْتُكَ<br>\
[I did not diminish to thee, &amp;c., or I have not<br>\
diminished to thee, &amp;c., aught]. (O.)<br>\
4<br>\
اغذّ: see 1, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  اغذّ فِى السَّيْرِ,<br>\
(S, * O, * L, K,) inf. n. إِغْذَاذٌ; (S, O, L;) and اغذّ<br>\
السَّيْرَ; (L, K;) He hastened in the pace or<br>\
journeying; (S, O, L, K;) and he hastened the<br>\
pace or journeying. (L, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Abu-l-Hasan<br>\
Ibn-Keysán thinks, from the use of the phrase<br>\
سَيْرٌ مُغِذٌّ, that one says also, اغذّ السَّيْرُ, meaning<br>\
The pace, or journeying, was quick. (L.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
غَذْغَذَ: see 1, last sentence but one.<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَغَذْغَدَ He leaped, sprang, or bounded.<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\
غَذِيذَةٌ Thick purulent matter (S, O, L, K) of a<br>\
wound; as also غَثِيثَةٌ. (S, O, L.) Yaakoob says<br>\
that the ذ of the former is a substitute for the ث<br>\
of the latter; (L;) and so says Ibn-es-Seed.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
غَاذٌّ [act. part. n. of 1, q. v.: as such signifying<br>\
A vein incessantly bleeding. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A recrudescence (عَرَب [inf. n. of عَرِبَ], so in the O, in<br>\
copies of the K غَرَب, and in the CK غَرْب, [app.<br>\
a mistranscription suggested by another explanation of غَاذٌّ which will be found in what follows,])<br>\
in any part of the body. (L, K.) AZ says, what<br>\
we call العَرَبُ, the Arabs term الغَاذُّ. (O.) One<br>\
says of a camel that has had a gall on the back<br>\
which has healed but is, or becomes, moist [or<br>\
exuding], بِهِ غَاذٌّ [He has a gall which has healed<br>\
but is moist, or constantly discharging, or exuding].<br>\
(S, O, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A vein, or duct, in the eye,<br>\
[also called غَرْبٌ,] which flows incessantly. (L, K.)<br>\
In this sense, and in that immediately preceding,<br>\
it is a subst. like كَاهِلٌ and غَارِبٌ. (L.)<br>\
-A2-  And<br>\
الغَاذُّ signifies الحِسُّ: one says, قَطَعَ اللّٰهُ غَاذَّ فُلَانٍ<br>\
i. e. حِسَّهُ [app. meaning May God cause to cease<br>\
the sound of such a one]. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O)<br>\
الغَاذَةُ The part that is in a state of commotion,<br>\
[or that pulses,] of the top of the head of a [young]<br>\
child; as also الغَاذِيَةُ [which belongs to art. غذو].<br>\
(IAar, K, TA.)<br>\
أَغَذُّ More, or most, or very, quick, and brisk,<br>\
or sprightly. (L.)<br>\
سَيْرٌ مُغِذٌّ A quick pace or journeying: a phrase<br>\
like لَيْلٌ نَائِمٌ. (L. [See also 4: and see an ex.<br>\
voce مُرِذٌّ, in art. رذ.])<br>\
مُغَاذٌّ A camel that loathes water. (S, O, L, K.)<br>\
