غَبَنَهُ, (S, MA, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
غَبِنَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. غَبْنٌ (S, MA, Msb, K, KL) and غَبَنٌ, or<br>\
the former is [the inf. n. used in this case, i. e.] in<br>\
selling [and the like], and the latter is in judgment, or opinion, (K, agreeably with a positive<br>\
statement in the S,) He cheated, deceived, overreached, or defrauded, him, (S, MA, K, KL,<br>\
TA,) in selling; (S, MA, K, TA;) he endamaged<br>\
him, or made him to suffer loss or damage or<br>\
detriment, (Msb, KL, TA,) in selling, (KL, TA,)<br>\
&amp;c., (KL,) or in the price, or otherwise: (Msb:)<br>\
[or] he overcame him in selling and buying.<br>\
(Msb.) And غُبِنَ He was cheated, or deceived<br>\
[&amp;c. in a purchase]: (S, K, TA:) and ↓ انغبن<br>\
[in like manner signifies] he became [cheated or<br>\
endamaged or] overcome in selling and buying.<br>\
(Msb.) And it is said that غَبَنَ فِى البَيْعِ, inf. n.<br>\
غَبْنٌ, signifies He was unmindful, or inadvertent,<br>\
[or perhaps غَبَنَ is here a mistranscription for<br>\
غُبِنَ, signifying thus, and therefore meaning he<br>\
was made to suffer loss,] in selling or in buying.<br>\
(TA.) And one says also, غُبِنَ الرَّجُلُ أَشَدَّ الغَبَنَانِ<br>\
[The man was cheated or deceived &amp;c. with the<br>\
utmost degree of cheating &amp;c.]. (Ibn-Buzurj,<br>\
TA.) غَبْنٌ يَسِيرٌ [A petty overreaching or endamaging] is one of which the rate is such as has<br>\
been estimated [as allowable by custom] by one estimator, not by every one: and غَبْنٌ فَاحِشٌ [An<br>\
exorbitant overreaching or endamaging] is one of<br>\
which the rate is such as has not been estimated<br>\
[as allowable by custom] by any one. (Dict. of<br>\
Technical Terms used in the Sciences of the Musalmans.) [الغُبْنُ وَالغَبَنُ mentioned by Freytag as<br>\
occurring in the Fákihet el-Khulafà, and expl. by<br>\
him as meaning “ Fraus omnimoda,” should, I<br>\
doubt not, be الغَبْنُ وَالغَبَنُ, the two inf. ns. mentioned in the first sentence above.] ―<br>\
-b2-  غَبَنَهُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
غَبِنَ, inf. n. غَبْنٌ, signifies also He passed by<br>\
him (i. e. a man) inclining, or leaning, [or bending<br>\
down, so as as to elude his observation, i. e.] so<br>\
that he [the latter] did not see him, and was not<br>\
cognizant of him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And it is said in the<br>\
TA that غَيَنُوا النَّاسَ means None but they obtained<br>\
it: whence it appears that فِيهِ or the like has<br>\
been omitted after النَّاسَ: with this addition, the<br>\
phrase may be rendered, they overreached, or<br>\
prevented, the other people in respect of it, by obtaining it themselves.] ―<br>\
-b4-  هٰذَا يَغْبِنُ عَقْلَكَ, said to<br>\
a man whom another had cheated (غَبَنَ) in a<br>\
sale, means This [man] attributes defect, or imperfection, to thy intellect. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  قَدْ غَبَنُوا<br>\
خَبَرَهَا, and غَبِنُوا, aor. of the former verb<br>\
غَبُنَ, and of<br>\
the latter<br>\
غَبَنَ, i. e. لَمْ يَعْلَمُوا عِلْمَهَا [meaning They<br>\
have not know her case or state or condition, or<br>\
her qualities], (ISh, K, ast; TA,) is a phrase relating<br>\
to a she-camel, of which it is said that she is<br>\
what one would desire a she-camel to be as a<br>\
beast for riding and in generousness of race, but<br>\
she is ↓ مَغْبُونَةٌ, [i. e.] one of which the qualities<br>\
are not known to be as above mentioned. (ISh,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  غَبَنْتَ رَأْيَكَ [if not a mistranscription for<br>\
غَبِنْتَ (see غَبِنَ رَأْيَهُ in what follows)] means<br>\
Thou hast lost, and forgotten, thy judgment, or<br>\
opinion. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  غَبِنَ الشَّئَْ and فِى الشَّئْ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
غَبَنَ, inf. n. غَبْنٌ and غَبَنٌ, signify He forgot<br>\
the thing: or he was unmindful, neglectful, or<br>\
heedless, of it; (K, TA;) and ignorant of it:<br>\
(TA:) or he made a mistake in respect of it; (K,<br>\
TA;) as in the saying, غَبِنَ كَذَا مِنْ حَقِّهِ عِنْدَ<br>\
فُلَانٍ [he made a mistake in respect of such a thing,<br>\
of his right, or due, to be required at the hand of such<br>\
a one]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  غَبِنَ رَأْيَهُ, inf. n. غَبَنٌ (S, Msb, K)<br>\
and غَبَانَةٌ, (S, * K,) means He was, or became,<br>\
deficient in his judgment, or opinion: (S:) or he<br>\
was, or became, weak [therein]: (K:) or his intelligence, or sagacity, and his sharpness, or acuteness, of mind, went away: (Msb:) the parsing<br>\
of this phrase has been [fully] expl. voce سَفِهَ<br>\
[q. v.]. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  غَبَنَ الثَّوْبَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. غَبْنٌ, (K,) from مَغْبِنٌ [q. v.], (Msb,) He<br>\
folded, or doubled, the garment, (T, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K, * TA,) it being [too] long. (T, TA,) and then<br>\
sewed it; (Mgh, Msb;) like خَبَنَهُ [q. v.] (S,<br>\
Mgh) and كَبَنَهُ. (Mgh.) And غَبَنَ الدَّلْوَ He<br>\
folded, or doubled, [the edge of] the leathern<br>\
bucket, to shorten it. (TA: but only the inf. n.<br>\
of the verb thus used is there mentioned.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And غَبَنَ الشَّئْ He hid, or concealed, the thing<br>\
in the مَغْبِن [or armpit or groin or the like];<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ اغتبنهُ. (K, TA.) غَبَنَ الطَّعَامَ<br>\
is like خَبَنَهُ [i. e. He concealed, kept, or stored,<br>\
wheat, or food, for a time of dearth, or adversity.] (S.)<br>\

or endamaging or overcoming in selling and buying: and ↓ مُغَابَنَةٌ signifies the same; or mutual<br>\
endeavoring to cheat &amp;c: see 3 in art زبن]. (S,<br>\
MA, K, KL, TA.) Hence, يَوْمُ التَّغَابُنِ [in the<br>\
Kur lxiv. 9], an appellation of The day of resurrection; because the people of Paradise will then<br>\
overreach (تَغْبِنُ) the people of Hell, (S, K, TA,)<br>\
by the state of enjoyment in which the former<br>\
will become and the punishment which the latter<br>\
will experience; or, as El-Hasan says, because<br>\
the former will attribute defect, or imperfection,<br>\
to the intellects of the latter by reason of the preferring infidelity to faith. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تغابن<br>\
له [i. e. لَهُ, but this, I think, is probably a mistranscription for بِهِ,] signifies تَقَاعَدَ [i. e. تقاعد<br>\
