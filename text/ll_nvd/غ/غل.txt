mentioned by IAar. (TA.) ―<br>\

of the S and K, which have misled Golius and<br>\
Freytag, ماله أُلٌّ وَغُلٌّ,]) a form of imprecation,<br>\

thrust, or pushed, in the back of his neck, and<br>\
become possessed, or insane, (IB, TA in the present art. and in art. ال,) and therefore have the<br>\
غُلّ put upon him. (TA in the present art.) And<br>\
غُلَّتْ يَدُهُ إِلَى عُنُقِهِ [sometimes] means (assumed tropical:)  His hand<br>\

and ↓ اغتلّ also; He was, or became, thirsty; or<br>\
vehemently thirsty; or affected with burning of the<br>\

camels in like manner, agreeably with this last<br>\
explanation: (K:) and ↓ اِغْتَلَّتْ is also said of<br>\
sheep or goats, (K, TA,) signifying they thirsted.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  غَلَّ صَدْرُهُ, aor. يَغِلٌّ, (S, O, K, TA, [in<br>\

inf. n. غِلٌّ, with kesr, (O,) His bosom was, or<br>\
became, affected with rancour, malevolence, malice,<br>\
or spite: (S, O, K:) and with dishonesty, or insincerity. (S, O.) [See also غِلٌّ, below.] It is<br>\
said in a trad., ثَلَاثٌ لَا يَغِلُّ عَلَيْهِنَّ قَلْبُ المُؤْمِنِ<br>\
i. e. [There are three habits, (خِصَال being understood, these, as is said in the O, being “ the acting sincerely towards God,” and “ giving honest<br>\
counsel to those in command,” and “ keeping to<br>\
the community ” of the Muslims,)] while conforming to which the heart of the believer will not be<br>\
invaded by rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite,<br>\
causing it to swerve from that which is right; (S, *<br>\
O;) a saying of the Prophet; thus related by<br>\
some: accord. to others, ↓ يُغِلُّ, (S, O,) with<br>\
damm to the ى, (O,) which is from the meaning<br>\
expl. in the next sentence here following. (S, * O.)<br>\
-A4-  غَلَّ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor. يَغُلُّ, (S, O,)<br>\
inf. n. غُلُولٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) He acted<br>\
unfaithfully; as also ↓ اغلّ: (S, O, Msb, K:) or<br>\
thus the latter, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) accord. to<br>\
ISk (S, Msb) and A&#39;Obeyd, (S,) in a general<br>\
sense; (Mgh, Msb;) and he became unfaithful:<br>\
(TA:) but the former verb is used only in relation to spoil, or booty; (S, Mgh, O, * Msb, K;)<br>\
you say, غَلَّ مِنَ المَغْنَمِ meaning خَانَ [i. e. He<br>\
acted unfaithfully in taking from the spoil, or<br>\
booty]; (S, O;) or meaning he acted unfaithfully<br>\
in relation to the spoil, or booty: (Mgh:) or غَلَّ,<br>\
(IAth, Mgh, TA,) aor. as above, (Mgh,) inf. n.<br>\
غُلُولٌ, (IAth, TA,) or غَلٌّ, (Mgh, [thus in my<br>\
copy, accord. to which it is trans., as will be<br>\
shown by what follows,]) signifies also he stole;<br>\
and was unfaithful in respect of a thing privily;<br>\
and such conduct is termed غُلُولٌ because, in the<br>\
case thereof, the hands, or arms, have the غُلّ<br>\
[q. v.] put upon them: (IAth, TA:) or it signifies also he took a thing and hid it amid his<br>\
goods; and it occurs in a trad. as meaning he<br>\
took a شَمْلَة privily. (Mgh.) It is said in the<br>\
Kur [iii. 155], وَمَا كَانَ لِنَبِىٍّ أَنْ يَغُلَّ and أَنْ<br>\
↓ يُغَلَّ, accord. to different readers; the former<br>\
meaning [And it is not attributable to a prophet]<br>\
that he would act unfaithfully; and ↓ ان يُغَلَّ<br>\
meaning, [agreeably with an explanation of أَغَلَّ<br>\
فُلَانًا in the K,] that unfaithful conduct should be<br>\
imputed to him; or that there should be taken<br>\
from his [share of the] spoil, or booty; (S, O,<br>\
TA;) [or this may mean, that he should be found<br>\
to be acting unfaithfully; for, accord. to the TA,<br>\
اغلّ الرَّجُلَ means وَجَدَهُ غَالًّا;] but IB says that a<br>\
pass. aor. is seldom found in the language of the<br>\
Arabs in a phrase of this kind. (TA.) And it is<br>\
said in a trad. وَلَا إِسْلَالَ ↓ لَا إِغْلَالَ i. e. There shall<br>\
be no acting unfaithfully nor stealing: or there shall<br>\
be no act of bribery [nor stealing]: (S, O:) or,<br>\
as some say, there shall be no aiding another to<br>\
act unfaithfully [&amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
-A5-  غَلَلْتُ لِلنَّاقَةِ I<br>\
fed the she-camel with غَلِيل i. e. date-stones mixed<br>\
with [the species of trefoil called] قِتّ. (S, * O,<br>\
TA.)<br>\

-A7-  غَلَّ<br>\
عَلَى الشَّىْءِ, inf. n. غَلٌّ; and ↓ اغلّ; He was silent<br>\
at the thing: and also he was intent upon the<br>\
thing. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
غلّلهُ, (K,) or غلّل لِحْيَتَهُ, (S, O,) بِالغَالِيَةِ,<br>\
(S, O, K,) inf. n. تَغْلِيلٌ, (K,) He perfumed him,<br>\
(K,) or daubed, or smeared, his beard, much, (O,)<br>\
the teshdeed denoting muchness, (S, O,) with غَالِيَة:<br>\
(S, O, K:) and بالغالية ↓ تغلّل and ↓ اغتلّ and<br>\
↓ تَغَلْغَلَ He perfumed himself with غالية: (K:)<br>\
Lh mentions تَغَلَّى بِالغَالِيَةِ, which is either from<br>\
the word غَالِيَة or originally تَغَلَّلَ, in the latter<br>\
case being like تَظَنَّيْتُ for تَظَنَّنْتُ, but the former<br>\
is the more agreeable with analogy: accord. to<br>\
Fr, one says, بالغالية ↓ تَغَلَّلْتُ, and not تَغَلَّيْتُ:<br>\
(TA:) As held ↓ تَغَلَّلْتُ from الغالية to be allowable if meaning I introduced the غالية into my<br>\
beard or my mustache; (S, O;) and the like is<br>\
the case with respect to غَلَّلْتُ بِهَا لِحْيَتِى: (S:)<br>\
accord. to Lth, one says, from الغالية, غَلَّلْتُ and<br>\
غَلَّفْتُ and غَلَّيْتُ. (TA. [See also 1 in art. غلف;<br>\
and see art. غلى.])<br>\
4<br>\
اغلّ إِبِلَهُ, (K,) inf. n. إِغْلَالٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
watered his camels ill, so that they did not satisfy<br>\
their thirst: (K, TA:) or he brought, or sent,<br>\
them back from the water without satisfying their<br>\
thirst: (O, TA:) thus expl. by Az, who says<br>\
that it is incorrectly mentioned by A&#39;Obeyd, on<br>\
the authority of AZ, [in this sense,] with the unpointed ع. (TA. [But see 4 in art. عل.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And اغلّ signifies also اغتلّت غَنَمُهُ (O, K)<br>\
[accord. to the TA as meaning His sheep, or<br>\
goats, thirsted: but this I think doubtful: see 8].<br>\
-A2-  اغلّ and its aor. and inf. n. as relating to unfaithfulness, see in the latter half of the first paragraph, in five places.<br>\

the غَلَّة. (TA.) ―<br>\

(a butcher) left some of the flesh sticking in the<br>\
hide, in stripping it off: (S, O:) or he took some<br>\
of the flesh and of the fat [in the hide] in the skinning: (K:) and الإِهَابَ ↓ غلّ he left somewhat [of<br>\
the flesh, or of the flesh and of the fat,] remaining<br>\
in the hide on the occasion of the skinning: a dial.<br>\
var. of أَغَلَّ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And accord. to AA,<br>\
الإِغْلَالُ signifies The milking of the she-camel<br>\

The taking, or receiving, [or obtaining,] of غَلَّة:<br>\

belongs a small portion of land of which he takes,<br>\

-A2-  And غَلْغَلَةٌ signifies also A breaking<br>\
[of the bone of the nose, and of the head of a flask<br>\

-A3-  [See مُغَلْغِلَةٌ.I<br>\
do not find any instance of the usage of غَلْغَلَ<br>\
otherwise than as trans.: but in the TK, and<br>\
hence by Freytag, غَلْغَلَةٌ in a sense in which it is<br>\
expl. below is regarded as an inf. n., and consequently the verb is said to signify He went<br>\
quickly; which is a meaning of R. Q. 2.]<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَغَلْغَلَ: see 1, first quarter, in two<br>\
places. قَدْ تَغَلْغَلْتَ يَا عَدُوَّ اللّٰهِ, said to the مُخَنَّث<br>\

captive when they took him, made of thongs, upon<br>\

being likened to shackles upon the necks]. (TA.)<br>\

-b2-  [Hence] the Arabs apply it metonymically to<br>\
denote (tropical:)  A wife. (TA.) And غُلٌّ قَمِلٌ [lit. A lousy<br>\
shackle for the neck &amp;c.] is an appellation of (assumed tropical:)  a<br>\
woman of evil disposition; originating from the<br>\
fact that the غُلّ used to be of thongs, upon which<br>\
was hair, so that it became infested with lice. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, and ↓ غُلَّةٌ, (S, O, K,) and ↓ غَلَلٌ, (K,)<br>\

increase of cattle, and the like, (TA,) and from<br>\
the rent of a house, (K, TA,) and from the hire<br>\
of a slave, (Mgh, K, TA,) and the like; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) [generally meaning corn, or grain; ??]<br>\

one&#39;s lending غَلَّة in order to have such as are<br>\
free from defect returned to him is disapproved:<br>\
(Mgh:) or dirhems [or pieces of money] that are<br>\
rejected by the treasury of the state, but taken by<br>\

says,<br>\
لَا يَذْهَبُ كَلَامُنَا غَلَلَا<br>\
[Our speech shall not pass away as a feeble flow<br>\

(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A strainer, or clarifier: occur-<br>\
