غَضَنَهُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
غَضِنَ and<br>\
غَضُنَ, (K,) inf. n. غَضْنٌ,<br>\
(S,) He, or it, (a man, and a thing, S,) withheld,<br>\
restrained, hindered, or diverted, him. (S, K.)<br>\
One says, مَا غَضَنَكَ عَنَّا What withheld, hindered,<br>\
or diverted, or has withheld, &amp;c., thee from us?<br>\
(S.) In the “ Nawádir ” of IAar, this verb,<br>\
which is correctly thus, with ض, is erroneously<br>\
with ص. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  غَضَنَتْ بِوَلَدِهَا, and ↓ غَضّنت,<br>\
She (a camel) cast her young one, or fœtus, in an<br>\
imperfect state, (K, TA.) before the hair had<br>\
grown upon it and its make had become [perfectly apparent. (TA. [See also خَدَجَتْ.])<br>\
[This is what is meant in the S where, after the<br>\
mention of a signification of ↓ التَّغْضِين which<br>\
will be found below, it is said that this word signifies also الرِّجَاعُ (??) رَجَعَتْ, q. v.):<br>\
hence, app., (though referring to the K as his<br>\
authority,) Freytag has given to غضّنت, as said<br>\
of a she-camel, besides the signification mentioned<br>\
above, another, which is also assigned to رَجَعَتْ;<br>\
(??) she falsely indicated her bring pregnant, by<br>\
raising (??) &amp;c.]<br>\

المَغَاضَنَةُ signifies مُكَاسَرَةُ العَيْنيْنِ [The contracting of the (??) as to wrinkle the lids], (S,<br>\
K, TA,) by reason of (??), or suspicion. (TA.)<br>\

العَيْنَيْنِ [i. e. He talked, or act, with the<br>\

with the contracting of the (??) so as to wrinkle<br>\
the lids] (A. TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اغضنت السَّمَآءُ The sky rained continually;<br>\
(S, TA;) as also غضنت [perhaps ↓ غَضَنَت, but<br>\
more probably, I think, ↓ غَضَّنَت] (TA.) And<br>\
غضنت السَّحَابَةُ [The (??) continually].<br>\
(S and TA in explanation of رَيَّمَت.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\

persistently. (IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اغضن عَلَيْهِ اللَّيْلُ<br>\

5<br>\
تغضّن It was, or became, wrinkled, shrivelled,<br>\
or puckered; syn. تَشَنَّجَ; (S, MA, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ غَضِنَ, inf. n. غَضَنٌ [and app. غُضُونٌ, like قُبُولٌ<br>\
as an inf. n. of قَبِلَ. though this requires consideration, as will be shown by what follows].<br>\
said of the face as having this signification, or<br>\
as signifying it was, or became, wrinkled and<br>\
speckled; (MA;) [and so, perhaps, ↓ غضّن, for]<br>\
التغضين [if not a mistranscription for التَّغَضُّنُ],<br>\
as also ↓ الغُضُونُ, is syn. with التَّشَنُّجُ; and one<br>\
says فِى جَبْهَتِهِ ↓ رَجُلٌ ذُو غُضُونٍ meaning تَكَسُّرٍ<br>\
[i. e. a man having a wrinkling in his forehead;<br>\
but غُضُون may be here used as pl. of غَضْنٌ, and<br>\
thus meaning wrinkles]: and ↓ غَضَنٌ signifies a<br>\
bending (تَثَنٍّ and تَلَوٍّ) of a branch or twig or the<br>\
like. (TA.) One says also, تَغَضَّنَتِ الدِّرْعُ عَلَى<br>\

mail, (S, K,) &amp;c. (S:) pl. غُضُونٌ, S Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K,) occurring in a verse cited in art. شأب (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, كَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى غُضُونِ<br>\
كَذَا [lit. That was within the folds, meaning in<br>\
the midst, of such a thing, or such an affair or<br>\
event]; like فِى أَثْنَآءِ كذا (TA in art. ثنى ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
غُضُونُ الأُذُنِ means The places of fold the<br>\
case; syn. مَثَانِيهَا. K, TA. in the CK [erroneously] ??.)<br>\
-A2-  Also (i. p. ?? and ↓ ??.<br>\

غَضَنُ العَيْنِ signifies The exterior, or apparent<br>\

غَضْنَهٌ [A patch of the smallpox] One says of<br>\
a person whose skin has became covered, or<br>\
wholly covered, (أُلْبِسَ,) with the smallpox, أُصْبَحَ<br>\
جِلْدُهُ غَضْنَةً وَاحِدَةً [His skin has became (??)<br>\
patch of the smallpox]: and some say غَضْبَة (S,)<br>\
غِضَانٌ the subst from the verb in the phrase<br>\
غَضَنَتْ بِوَلَدِهَا [i. e. a subst. signifying The (??)<br>\

غَضِينٌ A she-camel&#39;s young one or fœtus, cast<br>\

غضو and غضى<br>\
1<br>\
غَضَا, aor. يَغْضُو; and غَضَى, aor. يَغْضَى: see<br>\
4; the former, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  غَضَا, (K, TA,<br>\
aor. يَغْضُو, thus in the M, (TA,) inf. n. غُضُوٌّ.<br>\
(K, * TK,) He, i. e. a man, [and app. it. i. e. a<br>\
thing,] was, or became, such as is termed غَاضٍ<br>\
[q. v.]. (K, TA. [In the TK it is mentioned<br>\
only as said of a thing but the context in the K<br>\
indicates that it is said of a man, and app. of a<br>\
thing also.])<br>\
-A3-  [See also غُضُوٌّ below]<br>\
-A4-  غَضِيَتِ<br>\
الإِبِلُ, inf. n. غَضًا, The camels had a complaint<br>\
(M, K, TA) of their bellies (K, TA) from eating<br>\
of the trees called غَضًا. (M, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
غَضِيَتِ الأَرْضُ The land abounded with the trees<br>\
called غَضًا. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اغضى, (K,) inf. n. إِغْضَآءٌ, (S,) He contracted<br>\
his eyelids; drew them near together; (S, K;)<br>\
like غَضَّ; (TA in art. غض;) [and] so اغضى<br>\
عَيْنَهُ; said of a man: (Msb:) or he closed his<br>\
eyelids upon his iris; so in the M; as also ↓ غَضَا,<br>\
a dial. var. of اغضى, likewise mentioned by ISd;<br>\
and ↓ غَضَى, aor. يَغْضَى, is also a dial. var. thereof:<br>\
(TA:) or he made one of his eyelids to cleave to<br>\
the other, that he might not see a thing, by reason<br>\
of shame: (Har p. 19:) or he put one of his eyelids upon the other from dislike of a thing. (Id.<br>\
p. 492.) [See also 6.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence it is used in<br>\
relation to forbearance: so that one says, أَغْضَى<br>\
عَلَى القَذَى He held, or refrained, notwithstanding annoyance, spontaneously, without being asked,<br>\
or without constraint: (Msb, TA:) or اغضى عَلَى<br>\
قَذًى he bore annoyance patiently. (M, TA.) And<br>\
اغضى عَنْهُ He feigned himself neglectful of it; [he<br>\
closed his eyes from it;] he connived at it; as<br>\
also اغمض عنه. (TA in art. غمض.) And [sometimes] الإِغْضَآءُ means The abstaining from proceeding to extremities. (Mgh in art. جوز.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Hence also, اغضى عَلَى الشَّىْءِ He was silent respecting the thing; and so ↓ غَضَا, aor. يَغْضُو. (K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And اغضى عَنْهُ طَرْفَهُ means He closed,<br>\
or turned away, from him, or it, his eye, or eyes;<br>\
syn. سَدَّهُ [in the CK شَدَّهُ], or صَدَّهُ: (K, TA:)<br>\

-A2-  اغضى اللَّيْلُ The night<br>\
was, or became, dark; (S, Msb, K;) and covered<br>\
everything (K, TA) with its darkness; from ISd;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ غَضَا, aor. يَغْضُو. (K, TA. [See<br>\
also غُضُوٌّ.])<br>\
6<br>\
تغاضى He contracted, or put together, his<br>\
eyelids, that he might not see an evil, or unseemly,<br>\
thing. (Har p. 473. [See also 4.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[hence,] تغاضى عَنْهُ i. q. تَغَافَلَ [i. e. He was, or<br>\
he feigned himself, unmindful, &amp;c., of him, or it]:<br>\
(K, TA:) like تَغَابَى عنه: mentioned by Az.<br>\
(TA. [See, again, 4.])<br>\
غَضًا, said by Th to be written [thus] with ا<br>\
but ISd says, I know not why this is; (TA;)<br>\
[the latter, it seems, holding its last letter to be<br>\
originally ى, not و;] A species of trees, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) well known, (K,) the wood of which is of the<br>\
hardest of wood, and therefore there is hardness<br>\
in its charcoal; (Msb;) it is of the plants of the<br>\
sands, and has [sprigs, or foliage, of the kind<br>\
termed] هَدَب [q. v.], like that called أَرْطًى;<br>\
(TA;) and its fire is of long continuance: (Har<br>\
p. 60:) [see also رِمْثٌ: Mr. Palgrave (in his<br>\
Travels, i. 38,) describes it as a shrub believed<br>\
by him to be peculiar to the Arabian Peninsula,<br>\
“ of the genus Euphorbia, with a woody stem,<br>\
often five or six feet in height, and innumerable<br>\
round green twigs, very slender and flexible, forming a large feathery tuft, not ungraceful to the<br>\
eye, while it affords some kind of shelter to the<br>\
traveller, and food to his camels: ”] the sing. [or<br>\
rather n. un.] is غَضَاةٌ: (K:) and AHn says that<br>\
sometimes غَضَاتٌ is a pl. [of the n. un.]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, ذِئْبُ غَضًا [A wolf of trees, or shrubs,<br>\
called غَضًا]; (S, K;) or, as in the handwriting<br>\
of Aboo-Zekereeyà ذِئْبُ الغَضَا; and such is the<br>\
most abominable, or malignant, or noxious, of<br>\
wolves; for he comes not into close proximity to<br>\
men save when he desires to attack: or this<br>\
means the wolf of the covert of trees: for ―<br>\
-b3-  غَضًا<br>\
signifies also A covert of trees: (TA:) and a<br>\
غَيْضَة [i. e. thicket; or collection of tangled, or<br>\
confused, or dense, trees; &amp;c.]. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
أَهْلُ الغَضَا is an appellation of the people of Nejd,<br>\
(K, TA,) because of the abundance of [the trees<br>\
called] غضا there. (TA.)<br>\
بَعِيرٌ غَضٍ A camel having a complaint of his<br>\
belly from eating of the trees called غَضًا: and<br>\
إِبِلٌ غَضِيَةٌ and غَضَايَا [camels having such a complaint]; (S, K;) like رَمِثَةٌ and رَمَاثَى. (S.)<br>\
غَضْيَا: see غَضْيَآءُ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K, TA,) determinate, and imperfectly decl., like [its syn.] هُنَيْدَةُ,<br>\
(TA,) A hundred camels: (IAar, K, TA:) held<br>\
by ISk to be so called as being likened to a place<br>\
producing [an abundance of] غَضًا [i. e. the trees<br>\
thus called]: AA has mentioned it with the<br>\
article ال, saying that الغَضْيَا signifies a hundred.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
غَضْيَآءُ A land (أَرْضٌ) abounding with the trees<br>\
called غَضًا. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, as also ↓ غَضْيَا, A<br>\
place in which is a collection of the trees called<br>\
غَضًا; (K, TA;) a place where they grow. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And the former, Rugged land or ground.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
غُضُوٌّ Intense darkness of the night. (IKtt, TA.<br>\
[Perhaps in this sense an inf. n. of which the<br>\
verb is غَضَا: see 4, last sentence.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The<br>\
eating of the trees called غَضًا. (IKtt, TA. [App.<br>\
in this sense an inf. n. of which the verb is غَضَا.])<br>\
-A2-  And A state of muchness, abundance, copiousness, fulness, or completeness, or a thing. (K. [See<br>\
also 1, second sentence.])<br>\
رَجُلٌ غَضِىٌّ عَنِ الخَنَا or عَنِ الفَحْشَآءِ [A man<br>\
who refrains from taking notice of that which is<br>\
foul, abominable, unseemly, or obscene,] may be<br>\
from غَضَا; or it may be from أَغْضَى, similar to<br>\
أَلِيمٌ and وَجِيعٌ; but the former derivation is the<br>\
better. (TA.)<br>\
غَضَوِىٌّ a rel. n. from الغَضَا [the trees thus<br>\
called], and applied to a camel [app. as meaning<br>\
That is fond of, or wont to feed upon, the trees<br>\
called غَضًا]. (S.)<br>\
غَضْيَانَةٌ A herd of camels of generous race: (K,<br>\
TA:) mentioned by Az, from AA. (TA.)<br>\
غَاضٍ Dark; applied to night (لَيْل); as also<br>\
↓ مُغْضٍ, but this latter is rare: (S, Msb:) and so<br>\
غَاضِيَةٌ, (S, K,) applied to a night (لَيْلَة): (S:) or,<br>\
thus applied, accord. to Az, intensely dark. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And غَاضِيَةٌ signifies also Bright, or shining<br>\
brightly; (S, K;) applied to a night, (thus in<br>\
one of my copies of the S,) or to fire (نَار): (so<br>\
in other copies of the S and in the TA:) thus<br>\
having two contr. meanings. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
Great; applied to a fire (نار): a signification<br>\
said by Az to be taken from the fire of the tree<br>\
called غَضًا, which is of the best of firewood.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  بَعِيرٌ غَاضٍ A camel that eats the trees<br>\
called غَضًا: and إِبِلٌ غَاضِيَةٌ and غَوَاضٍ [camels<br>\
