اِتَّكَأَ He sat in a firm, or settled, manner:<br>\
and he sat leaning upon one of his sides: (Msb,<br>\
in art. تكأ:) the vulgar know it only in the<br>\
latter sense: but it signifies he leaned, rested,<br>\
or stayed, his back, or his side, against, or upon,<br>\
a thing: and he leaned, rested, or stayed, himself in any manner, upon a thing. (IAth, in<br>\
Msb, art. وكأ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اِتَّكَأَ عَلَى شَىْءٍ, (S,) and ↓ توكّأ,<br>\
(S, K,) and ↓ اوكأ; (K;) and ↓ تَكِئَ, [in which<br>\

-b4-  اِتَّكَأَ He<br>\

upon which to lean, or recline: (CK, and a MS.<br>\
copy of the K:) or he made him to be a thing<br>\
upon which to lean, or recline. (TA.) [The<br>\

read أَتْكَأَ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  اِتَّكَأْنَا عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  We ate a repast<br>\
with, or at the abode of, such a one. (TA.)<br>\

was taken with the pains of labour, and cried<br>\
out. (K.) Accord. to Lth, تَوَكُّؤُ النَّاقَةِ signifies<br>\
تصلّفها عند مخاضها: (TA:) [but it is evident<br>\
that the right reading is تصلّقها; and the sense<br>\
agreeable with the above explanation].<br>\

(said Mohammad) eat not sitting in a firm, or<br>\
settled, posture, cross-legged, or in such other<br>\
similar manner as is adapted for much eating:<br>\
for he used to eat sitting upon his hams, with<br>\
his shanks erect, so as to be ready to rise.<br>\
The meaning is not [only] “ inclining on one<br>\
side,” as the vulgar among students imagine.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
مُتَّكَأ A place in which one reclines: (S:) a<br>\
chamber, or sitting-room. (Akh, S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  That<br>\
upon which one leans, or reclines, in eating,<br>\
drinking, or talking. (Zj.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  Food, or a<br>\
repast: so called because people used to recline<br>\
when they sat to eat: but the Muslims are<br>\
forbidden to do so. [See مُتَّكِئٌ.] It is said to<br>\
have this last meaning in the Kur. xii. 31.<br>\
