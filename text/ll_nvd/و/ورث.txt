وَرِثَ, aor. يَرِثُ, (S, K,) an instance of<br>\
deviation from a constant rule, there being only<br>\
the following verbs of the measure فَعِلَ which<br>\
have the aorists of the measure يَفْعِلُ only,<br>\
namely, وَثِقَ, وَرِثَ, وَرِعَ, وَرِمَ, وَرِىَ, وَفِقَ, وَلِىَ,<br>\
and وَمِقَ, (Ibn-Málik and others,) and وَصِبَ:<br>\
(TA, art. وَصب:) the و falls out in يَرِثُ [&amp;c.]<br>\
because it occurs between ى and kesreh; and in<br>\
those persons of the aor. which begin with ا and<br>\
ت and ن because these letters are changed from<br>\
ى, which is the original: (S:) inf. n. وِرْثٌ and<br>\
إِرْثٌ, (S, K,) in which the و is changed into أ,<br>\
(S,) and رِثَةٌ, (S, K,) in which the ة is a substitute for the [elided] و, (S,) and وِرَاثَةٌ (S, K,)<br>\
[the most common form] and إِرَاثَةٌ, (TA,) and<br>\
accord. to some مِيرَاثٌ, but this is an error, for<br>\
مِفْعَالٌ is not one of the measure of inf. ns.,<br>\
(ISd,) [but it is used by some of the professors<br>\
of practical law as an inf. n.,] and تُراثٌ: (Msb<br>\
[but see وِرْثٌ below]:) He inherited. (S, K,<br>\
&amp;c.) You say وَرِثَ أَبَاهُ He inherited [the property of] his father: (S, K:) but the original<br>\
phrase is وَرِثَ مَالَ أَبِيهِ He inherited the property of his father. (Msb.) Also وَرِثَ مِنْ أَبِيهِ<br>\
(and عَنْهُ, A,) He inherited of his father: (K:)<br>\
or he inherited part of the property of his father.<br>\
(Msb.) And وَرِثَ الشَّىْءَ مِنْ أَبِيهِ He inherited<br>\
the thing of, or from, his father. (S.) When<br>\
you say وَرِثَ زَيْدٌ أَبَاهُ مَالًا [Zeyd inherited of his<br>\
father property], the word مالا is a second<br>\
objective complement, if the verb be doubly<br>\
trans.; or it is a substitute of implication<br>\
(بَدَلُ اشْتِمَالٍ) for زيد. (MF.) You say وَرِثْتُهُ<br>\
مَالَهُ, and مَجْدَهُ, I inherited his property, and,<br>\
(tropical:)  his glory: and وَرِثْتُهُ عَنْهُ I inherited it from<br>\
him. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
ورثّهُ, inf. n. تَوْرِيثٌ, He included him among<br>\
the heirs of his property: (S:) or made him to<br>\
be one of his heirs: (TA:) [see also 4:] or<br>\
ورثّهُ مَالًا he included him among his heirs, he<br>\
not being one of them, and assigned him a portion:<br>\
(AZ, Msb:) [in like manner,] ورّث فِى مَالِهِ he<br>\
included among his heirs of his property one or<br>\
more not of them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَرَّثْتُ فُلَانًا مِنْ<br>\
فُلَانٍ I made such a one to be the heir of such a<br>\
one. (TA.) See 4.<br>\
-A2-  ورّث He stirred a fire,<br>\
in order that it might burn up, or blaze: (K:)<br>\
a dial. form of أَرَّثَ, q. v. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اورثهُ الشَّىْءَ He (his father) made him to<br>\
inherit the thing. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اورثهُ إِيرَاثًا حَسَنًا He<br>\
made him to have a goodly inheritance. (TA.)<br>\
اورثهُ الإِرْثَ, and المِيرَاثَ, and إِيَّاهْ ↓ ورّثهُ, He made<br>\
him to inherit the heritage. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اورثهُ and<br>\
↓ ورثّهُ He (his father) made him to be one of his<br>\
heirs. (K.) [See also 2.] ―<br>\
-b4-  اورث وَلَدَهُ He<br>\
made his son sole heir. (AZ.) ―<br>\
-b5-  اورثهُ شَيْئًا (tropical:)  It<br>\
occasioned him, as its result, a thing. Ex. اورثه<br>\
المَرَضُ ضَعْفًا (tropical:)  The disease occasioned him, as its<br>\
result, weakness. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَوَارَثوُهُ كَابِرًا عَنْ كَابِرٍ (tropical:)  [They inherited it<br>\
by degrees, one great in dignity and nobility from<br>\
another great in dignity and nobility]. (S.) [See<br>\
art. كبر.] ―<br>\
-b2-  تَوَارَثَنِى الحَوَادِثُ (Bedr Ibn-&#39;Ámir<br>\
El-Hudhalee) (tropical:)  Misfortune took me by turns,<br>\
as though they inherited me, one from another.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
وَرْثٌ (tropical:)  What is fresh, juicy, or moist, of<br>\
things. (K.)<br>\
وِرْثٌ and ↓ إِرْثٌ [see 1] and ↓ تُرَاثٌ (in which<br>\
the ت is originally و, S,) and مِيرَاثٌ (originally<br>\
مِوْرَاثٌ, the و being changed to ى because of the<br>\
kesreh immediately preceding it, S.) What is<br>\
inherited; an inheritance, or a heritage: or,<br>\
accord. to some, ورث and ميراث are used with<br>\
reference to property, or wealth; and ارث with<br>\
reference to rank or quality, nobility or eminence,<br>\
reputation, or the like, in Arabic, حَسَب: (M:)<br>\
[the pl. of ميراث is مَوَارِيثُ.] [See also art.<br>\
أرِث.] ―<br>\
-b2-  أُثْبُتُواعَلَى مَشَاعِرِكُمْ هٰذِهِ فَإِنَّكُمْ عَلَى<br>\
إِرْثٍ مِنْ إِرْثِ إِبْرٰهِيمَ (tropical:)  Remain ye steadfast in the<br>\
observance of these your rites, or ceremonies;<br>\
for ye act [therein] according to usage inherited<br>\
from Abraham. (TA, [app. from A&#39;Obeyd].)<br>\
[See also إِرْثٌ in art أرث.] ―<br>\
-b3-  لَهُمْ إِرْثُ مَجْدٍ<br>\
(tropical:)  They have an inheritance of glory. (TA.)<br>\
وَرْثَةٌ Fire. (L.)<br>\
وَارِثٌ An heir: pl. وُرَّاث and وَرَثَةٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in a prayer (of Mohammad,<br>\
TA) أَللّٰهُمَّ أَمْتِعْنِى بِسَمْعِى وَبَصَرِى وَاجْعَلْهُ الوَارِثَ<br>\
منِّى [O God, cause me to enjoy my hearing and<br>\
my sight, and make it (i. e. the enjoyment that<br>\
I pray for, TA) survive me: or,] make it to continue with me until I die. (K.) Or, accord. to<br>\
another relation, which substitutes وَاجْعَلْهُمَا for<br>\
واجعله, make them both to continue with me,<br>\
sound, until I die. Or, as some say, what is<br>\
meant is the continuance and strength of those<br>\
two faculties in old age, so that they may<br>\
survive all the other powers: so says ISh.<br>\
Some say, that by سَمْع is meant the remembering of what is heard, and the acting according<br>\
thereto; and by بَصَر, the being admonished by<br>\
what is seen, and the light of the heart, whereby<br>\
one escapes from perplexity and darkness to the<br>\
right course. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  الوَارِثُ (as an epithet<br>\
applied to God, TA.) He who remains after<br>\
the creatures have perished. (K.) He remains<br>\
after everything beside Him has perished; and<br>\
thus, what was the property of mankind, his<br>\
servants, returns to Him. (TA.)<br>\
