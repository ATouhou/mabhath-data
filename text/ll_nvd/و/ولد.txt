―<br>\
-b5-  [لَمْ يَلْدِهِ occurs in a verse cited voce رُبَّ,<br>\
for لَمْ يَلِدْهُ; like لم أَجْدِ for لَمْ أَجِدْ.]<br>\

-b2-  See وَلَدٌ.<br>\
وِلْدٌ: see وُلْد, and وَلَدٌ.<br>\
وَلَدٌ (of the measure فَعَلٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولٌ, Msb) and ↓ وُلْدٌ (S, A, L, Msb,<br>\
K) and ↓ وِلْدٌ (S, L, K) and ↓ وَلْدٌ, (K,) each<br>\
used alike as sing. and pl., (S, M, A, L, K,)<br>\
and masc. and fem., (M, L, Msb,) A child, son,<br>\
daughter, youngling, or young one; and children,<br>\

Keys, (T, Msb,) who make وَلَدٌ singular. (T.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  مَنْ دَمَّى عَقِبَيْكِ ↓ وُلْدُكِ, a proverb, (T, S,<br>\
L; but in the S, عَقِبَيْكَ;) of the Benoo-Asad,<br>\
(S, L,) Thy son is he who made thy two heels to<br>\
be smeared with blood; (TA;) i. e., whom thou<br>\
thyself broughtest forth; (K, TA;) he is thy<br>\
son really; not he whom thou hast taken from<br>\
another, and adopted. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ<br>\
وَلَدِ الرَّجُل هُوَ I know not what man he is.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
لِدَةٌ, in which the ة is a substitute for the<br>\
و that is elided from the beginning, for it is<br>\
from الوِلَادَةُ, (S, L,) or, accord. to some, it is<br>\
from لَدى, q. v., (TA,) applied to a male and<br>\
to a female, (TA, voce تِرْبٌ,) i. q. تِرْبٌ; (S, L,<br>\
K;) meaning One born at the same time with<br>\
another; coëtanean, or a contemporary in birth<br>\
(TA) of a man: (S, L:) dual لِدَانِ; (S, L;)<br>\
[but لِدَةٌ occurs in a dual sense in the Jm and O<br>\
and K, voce صَوْغٌ, q. v.;] pl. لِدَاتٌ and لِدُونَ: (S,<br>\
L, K:) AHei and other expositors of the Tesheel say, that words like لدة have the latter<br>\
form of pl. when they become proper names.<br>\
(TA.) The dim. [of the pl.] is وُلَيْدَاتٌ and<br>\
وُلَيْدُونَ, (K,) because the formation of a dim.<br>\
restores a word to its original form; (TA;)<br>\
not لُدَيَّاتٌ and لُدَيُّونَ, as some of the Arabs<br>\
erroneously make it: (K:) but this which F<br>\
pronounces an error is accordant to the authority<br>\
of the leading writers on inflexion, who say<br>\
that by regarding the original form, and restoring it thereto, the word is made to depart<br>\
from the meaning intended by it; for if its<br>\
dim. were made وُلَيْدٌ, there would be no difference between it and the dim. of وَلَدٌ. (TA.)<br>\
See also art. لدى. ―<br>\
-b2-  See مِيلَادٌ.<br>\
وِلَادٌ and وَلَادٌ: see 1. ―<br>\

Msb:) the former is the more common. (Msb.)<br>\
وَلُودٌ [Prolific; that breeds, or brings forth,<br>\
plentifully.] (S, K, art. أبد.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See وَالِدٌ.<br>\
وَلِيدٌ (of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of<br>\
the measure مَفْعُولٌ, TA,) and ↓ مَوْلُودٌ signify<br>\
the same, (T, L, K,) i. e., A new-born child:<br>\
(M, L:) a young infant: (the former in the<br>\
L, and the latter in the Msb:) the former, as<br>\
well as the latter, masc.: (M, L:) or, accord.<br>\
to some, the former is applied also to a female:<br>\
as also ↓ وَلِيدَةٌ and ↓ مَوْلُودَةٌ: pl. of وليد, وِلْدَانٌ;<br>\
and of وليدة. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الولَِيدُ فِى الجَنَّةِ<br>\
The child that dies in early infancy, or that is<br>\
prematurely born, is in paradise. (L, from a<br>\
trad.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also وَلِيدٌ, وَلَائِدُ. A boy: (S, A, L, K:) a<br>\
youth: (AHeyth, L:) (tropical:)  a boy who has arrived<br>\
at the age when he is fit for service, before he<br>\
attains to puberty: (A, L:) a youthful servant;<br>\
one is so called from the time of his birth until<br>\
he attains to manhood: the servant of a man<br>\
in paradise is a وليد always, never changing in<br>\
age: (L:) a slave; (S, L, K;) or, as some say,<br>\
one born in servitude: (TA:) fem. in these<br>\
senses, with ة: (S, A, L, K:) a female slave is<br>\
called وليدة even if aged: (L:) pl. (of the<br>\
masc., S, L) وِلْدَانٌ (S, L, K) and وِلْدَهٌ; (L;)<br>\
and (of the fem.,: S, L) وَلَائِدُ. (S, L, K.) ―<br>\

[They are in a case, or an affair, wherein (lit.<br>\
whereof) the boy, or servant-boy, or slave, will<br>\
not be called out to]: a proverb, (L,) originally<br>\
meaning, they are in a case of difficulty or<br>\
distress, such that the mother forgets her child,<br>\
and does not call out to him: and afterwards<br>\
applied to any case of difficulty or distress:<br>\
(M, L:) or they are in a formidable case, in<br>\
which children are not called out to, but those<br>\
advanced in age: (AO, or As, M, L:) and<br>\
sometimes it means, they are in such a state of<br>\
abundance and affluence that if a وليد put forth<br>\
his hand to take a thing he is not chidden away<br>\
from it: (M, L:) or it is applied to a case of<br>\
good and to one of evil, and means, they are so<br>\
occupied with their case or affair that if a وليد<br>\
put forth his hand to the most valuable of<br>\
things he is not called out to for the purpose of<br>\
chiding him: (K:) some say, that its original<br>\
reference is to the running of horses; because a<br>\
fleet and excellent horse goes without being<br>\
called out to; and that it is secondarily applied<br>\
to any case of great moment, and to any case<br>\
of abundance. (S, L.) ―<br>\
-b7-  One also says, فِى<br>\
الأَرْضِ عُشْبٌ لَا يُنَادَى وَلِيدُهُ [In the land is fresh<br>\
herbage respecting which the servant-boy, or slave,<br>\
will not be called out to]; because it matters not<br>\
in what part of such land the beasts are; the<br>\
whole abounding with herbage: and جَاؤُوا بِطَعَامٍ<br>\
لَا يُنَادَى وَلِيدُهُ [They brought food respecting<br>\
which the servant-boy, or slave, would not be<br>\
called out to]; meaning, that one would not<br>\
care what injury he might do to it, nor when he<br>\
ate of it. (ISk, L.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Muzarrid Eth-Thaalebee<br>\
says,<br>\

إِلَى اللّٰهِ مِنِّى لَا يُنَادَى وَلِيدُهَا<br>\
[I have become clear of the vice of reviling men,<br>\

called out to]; meaning, respecting which I<br>\
shall not be questioned. (ISk, L)<br>\

called by the former appellation [as well as the<br>\
latter] because of his recent age. (L, K.) [It<br>\
is difficult to mark the exact line of distinction<br>\
between the Islámees and the Muwelleds, so as<br>\
always to be certain to which of these two classes<br>\
a poet belongs. The latter are those born, not<br>\
merely since the first corruption of the Arabic<br>\
language, which happened in, or before, the<br>\
age of Mohammad, (see Mz, 44th نوع,) but<br>\
since the extensive corruption which happened<br>\
after the Arabs had spread themselves, by their<br>\
conquests, among foreigners, in consequence of<br>\
which their language became simplified. This<br>\
change took place in the latter half of the first<br>\
century of the Flight. Hence the poetry of<br>\
the Muwelleds in not cited as authoritative in<br>\
lexicology or grammar, or as to the metres of<br>\
verse, or rhymes. (See شَاهِدٌ.)] Ibn-Rasheek<br>\
mentions, as the most famous of the Muwelleds,<br>\
El-Hasan (surnamed Aboo-Nuwás) Habeeb, ElBohturee, Ibn-Er-Roomee, Ibn-El-Moatezz, and<br>\
El-Mutanebbee: [the first of whom died in<br>\
the year of the Flight 195, or -6, or -8]. Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Amr Ibn-El- &#39;Alà [who died in the year of the<br>\
Flight 154, or -9,] termed El-Farezdak and Jereer<br>\

Islámees. (Mz, 49th نوع.) ―<br>\

innovated by any of the Muwelleds, whose<br>\
phrases or words are not cited as authoritative<br>\
[in lexicology, or grammar, or as to the metres<br>\

between it and the مَصْنُوع is, that the latter is<br>\
given by its author as chaste (فصيح) Arabic;<br>\
whereas this is the contrary [i. e., confessedly<br>\
innovated]. (Mz, 21st نوع.) It is opposed to<br>\
