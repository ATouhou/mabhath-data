وَجَدَهُ, aor. يَجِدُ and يَجُدُ, (S, L, Msb, K,)<br>\
the latter of the dial. of the tribe of &#39;Ámir (S, L,<br>\
Msb) Ibn-Saasa&#39;ah, (MF,) and without a parallel<br>\
(S, L, Msb, K) in verbs of this class, (S, L, Msb,)<br>\
the و in it being dropped because it falls out in<br>\
the original form of the aor., (Msb,) both of<br>\
which forms are said by several authors to apply<br>\
to the verb in all its significations, though F<br>\
seems to restrict the latter to two significations,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. وُجُودٌ (S, L, Msb, K) and وِجْدَان<br>\
(L, Msb, K,) and إِجْدَانٌ, (IAar, L, K,) in<br>\
which the و is changed into ء, (L,) and وَجْدٌ<br>\
and وُجْدٌ and جِدَةٌ; (L, K;) and وَجِدَهُ, aor.<br>\
يَجِدُ; (K;) but this form of the verb is not<br>\
found in the lexicons, [the K only accepted,]<br>\
(MF,) in the sense here assigned to it; (TA;)<br>\
He found it; lighted on it; attained it; obtained<br>\
it by searching or seeking; discovered it; perceived it; saw it; experienced it, or became<br>\
sensible of it; (F, in the K and in the Basáïr,<br>\
on the authority of Abu-l-Kásim El-Isbahánee;)<br>\
namely, a thing sought, sought for or after, or<br>\
desired; (S, L, K;) and simply a thing. (L.)<br>\
وُجُود is of several kinds. It is The finding, &amp;c.,<br>\
by means of any one of the five senses: as when<br>\
one says وَجَدْتُ زَيْدًا [I found, &amp;c., Zeyd]:<br>\
and وَجَدَتُ طَعْمَهُ, and رَائِحَتَهُ, and صَوْتَهُ, and<br>\
خُشُونَتَهُ, [I found, or perceived, &amp;c., its taste,<br>\
and its odour, and its sound, and its roughness].<br>\
Also, The finding, &amp;c., by means of the faculty<br>\
of appetite, [or rather of sensation, which is the<br>\
cause of appetite:] as when one says وَجَدْتُ<br>\
الشِّبَعَ [I found, experienced, or became sensible<br>\
of, satiety]. Also, The finding, &amp;c., by the<br>\
intellect, or by means of the intellect: of which<br>\
kind is one&#39;s knowing God: and here it should<br>\
be observed, that وجود attributed to God is<br>\
simple knowledge: (Abu-l-Kásim El-Isbahánee,<br>\
cited in the Basáïr:) وَجَدَ اللّٰهُ, wherever it<br>\
occurs, means God knew. (Er-Rághib, Z, &amp;c.)<br>\
i. e., in the Kur-án. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَجَدَ [He found,<br>\
in the sense of] he knew [by experience]. (A,<br>\
TA, &amp;c.) [In this sense, it is a verb of the<br>\
kind called أَفْعَالُ القُلُوبِ; having two objective<br>\
complements; the first of which is called its<br>\
noun, and the second its predicate.] Ex. وَجَدْتُ<br>\
زَيْدًا ذَا الحِفَاظِ I [found, or] knew Zeyd to<br>\
possess the quality of defending those things<br>\
which should be sacred, or inviolable. (A.)<br>\
Used in this sense, as doubly trans., its inf. n.<br>\
is وَجْدَانٌ (Akh) and وُجُودٌ. (Seer.) It is also<br>\
used as singly trans., as syn. with عَلِمَ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  When وَجَدَ signifies he found, or lighted on,<br>\
a thing after it had gone away, its inf. n. is<br>\
وِجْدَانٌ. (IKtt.) ―<br>\
-b4-  وَجَدَ الضَّالَّةَ, (S, A, Msb,)<br>\
aor. يَجِد (Msb) and يَجُدُ, (MF,) inf. n. وَجْدَانٌ<br>\
(S, Msb) and لَمْ أَجِدْ مِنْ ذٰلِكَ بُدًّا (Msb) [He found the stray<br>\
beast]. ―<br>\
-b5-  لَمْ أَجِدْ مِنْ ذٰلِكَ بُدًّا, for which one<br>\
also says لَمْ اجدِ, I found no means of avoiding,<br>\
or escaping, that. (Kz, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  وَجَدَ, (L,)<br>\
and وَجَدَ فِى المَالِ, (Fs, T, S, L, Msb,) and<br>\
وَجَدَ المَالَ وَغَيَرَهُ, (Lh, M, K,) aor. يَجِدُ, (Lh,<br>\
M, L, K,) inf. n. وُجْد and وِجد and وَجْدٌ- and<br>\
جِدَهٌ (Lh, T, S, M, K) and وِجْدَانٌ (T, L) an[id<br>\
وُجُودٌ, (Yz,) He became possessed of wealth, or<br>\
property: (T:) or he was, or became, rich;<br>\
possessed of competence, or sufficiency; in no<br>\
need; without wants, or with few wants; (S, M,<br>\
L, K;) so as not to be poor afterwards: (L:)<br>\
and he gained, acquired, or earned wealth.<br>\
(Exps. of the Fs.) Hence the saying of the<br>\
Arabs, وِجْدَانُ الرَّقِينِ يُغَطِّى أَفَنَ الأَفِينِ [The<br>\
possession of money hides the weakness of judgment of the weak in judgment]. (T, L.)<br>\

and يَجُدُ; (M, L, K;) and وَجِدَ, as heard by<br>\
Fr from certain of the Arabs; (Kzz;) inf. n.<br>\
مَوْجِدَةٌ, (Fs, S, A, L, Msb, K,) by some pronounced مَوْجَدَةٌ, (Fr,) and وَجْدٌ and جِدَةٌ (L, K)<br>\
and وِجْدَانٌ (Lh, S, M, L) and وُجُودٌ (Fr, Kzz)<br>\

or he was angry with him with the anger that<br>\

&amp;c.,) and وَجِدَ, [aor. يَوْجَدُ,] (El-Hejeree, M, K,)<br>\

بِهِ, (Msb,) and لَهُ ↓ توجّدت, (S, L,) I grieved,<br>\
mourned, or sorrowed, for such a one. (S, L,<br>\
Msb.) Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee says, that in<br>\
this sense وجد is not transitive: (MF:) [i. e.,<br>\
without a prep.].<br>\
-A5-  وُجِدَ, (inf. n. وُجُودٌ, A,<br>\
Msb,) It existed; it became existent (A, Msb)<br>\
from a state of nonexistence. (S, L, K.)<br>\

أَوْجَدَنِى بَعْدَ فَقْرٍ وَآجَدَنِى بَعْدَ ضَعْفٍ Praise<br>\
be to God who enriched me after poverty and<br>\

meaning, created it; originated it; caused it to<br>\
be or exist, or to come to pass; brought it into<br>\
existence (S, L, Msb, K) from a state of nonexistence, (Msb,) not after the similitude of anything preëxisting. (TA.) وَجَدَهُ in this sense is<br>\
not allowable. (S, L, K.)<br>\

putting off the payment of his debt with promises<br>\
repeated time after time makes his punishment<br>\
allowable. (L, from a trad. See Mgh art. لوى.)<br>\

come to pass; brought into existence: (MF:)<br>\
pl. مَوْجُودَاتٌ: which is a term applied to three<br>\
kinds of things: namely, that which exists and<br>\
has neither beginning nor end; and such is only<br>\
God: that which exists and has a beginning and<br>\
an end; as the substances of the present world:<br>\
and that which exists and has a beginning but<br>\
no end; as men in the world to come. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Present.] ―<br>\
