load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'ويسوَيْسٌ a word used to. denote compassion, or<br>\
pity, and admiration of one&#39;s beauty; (M, K;)<br>\
the object being a child; (K;) as when one<br>\
says of a child, وَيْسَهُ مَا أَمْلَحَهُ [Merry on him!<br>\
or the like: how beautiful is he!]: (TA:) or<br>\
وَيْسٌ and وَيْحٌ are used in the place of وَيْلٌ;<br>\
(TA;) and وَيْسٌ لَهُ signifies وَيْلٌ لَهُ [Woe to<br>\
him!]: (M, TA:) or, as some say, وَيْسٌ is a<br>\
word denoting contempt; and has no verb;<br>\
analogy forbidding that it should have one:<br>\
(IJ, M:) Aboo-Turáb says, I heard Abu-sSemeyda&#39; say, وَيْسٌ and وَيْحٌ and وَيْلٌ have one<br>\
meaning: (TA:) or وَيْسَكَ is not said except to<br>\
children; and وَيْلَكَ is an expression in which is<br>\
roughness and reproach; and ويح is a gentle and<br>\
good expression. (AHát, TA.) See ويْحٌ and<br>\
وَيْلٌ and وَيْبٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  It also signifies Poverty.<br>\
(ISk, M.) And one may say, if it be right to<br>\
say so to one, وَيْسٌ لَهُ as meaning Poverty be to<br>\
him. (ISk.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, What a man desires.<br>\
(M, K.) So in the phrase لَقِىَ وَيْسًا He found,<br>\
or met with, or experienced, what he desired;<br>\
(M, K;) accord. to an explanation given by<br>\
IAar; so that it means much: but in one place<br>\
he says that this phrase signifies he found, &amp;c.,<br>\
what he did not desire. (M.)<br>\
ويل &amp;c.<br>\
