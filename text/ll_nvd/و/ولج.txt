وَلَجَ, aor. يَلِجُ, inf. n. وُلُوجٌ and لِجَةٌ; and<br>\
↓ إِتَّلَجَ; (S, K;) and ↓ تولّج; (L;) He, or it,<br>\
entered. (S, K.) You say وَلَجَ البَيْتَ, and<br>\
↓ اتّلجه, and ↓ تولّجهُ, He entered the house.<br>\
(L.) And وَلَجَ الشَّىْءُ فِى غَيرِهِ The thing entered<br>\
into another thing. (Msb.) As is said in the S<br>\
and L, Sb says that وَلَجَ has for its inf. n. وُلُوجٌ,<br>\
which is of one of the measures of the inf.<br>\
ns. of intrans. verbs, because the meaning [of<br>\
وَلَجْتُ البَيْتَ] is وَلَجْتُ فِيهِ: and it is said in<br>\
the M, that Sb holds the intermediate particle to<br>\
be dropped: but Mohammad Ibn-Yezeed holds<br>\
the verb to be trans. without an intermediate<br>\
particle. MF observes, that Sb&#39;s words appear<br>\
to make ولج a trans. verb, which no one asserts<br>\
it to be: that if he mean that it has as its<br>\
complement a noun in the acc. case as an adverbial noun of place, it is like دَخَلْتُ and<br>\
other intrans. verbs: but if he mean that it<br>\
governs a simple objective complement, like<br>\
ضَرَبْتُ زَيْدًا, his opinion is not correct. (TA.)<br>\

اولج, (S, K,) inf. n. إِيلَاجٌ; (Msb;) and<br>\

of the K) or أَتْلَجَ, (as in the L, and all the<br>\
copies of the K consulted by SM, in this art.,<br>\
and in art. تلج,) in which ت is substituted for<br>\
و, and this is the correct reading; (TA;) He,<br>\
or it, caused to enter; introduced; inserted.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The expression in the Kur. [xxii. 60;<br>\
and other chapters,] يُولِجُ اللَّيلَ فِى النَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ<br>\
النَّهَارَ فِى اللَّيْلِ signifies He maketh the night,<br>\
by increasing it, to enter into, [or encroach<br>\
upon,] the day, and maketh the day, in like<br>\
manner, to enter into, [or encroach upon,]<br>\
the night: (Jel:) or He increaseth the night<br>\
with a part of the day, by taking from the<br>\
latter and adding to the former, and in like<br>\
manner increaseth the day with a part of the<br>\
night. (S.) ―<br>\

وَلَجَةٌ A place, (S,) or a cavern, in which<br>\
passengers shelter themselves from rain &amp;c.:<br>\
pl. أَوْلَاجٌ and وَلَجٌ, (S, K,) [or rather the latter,<br>\
which is omitted in the CK, is a coll. gen. n., of<br>\
which ولجة is the n. un.] or وُلُجٌ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, A bend, or place of bending, of a valley:<br>\

وَلِيجَةٌ Anything that is introduced, or inserted,<br>\
into a thing, and that does not belong to it:<br>\
any such thing is termed a وليجة of a thing.<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  هُوَ وَلِيجَتُهُمْ He is an adherent<br>\
to them; (K;) one who has entered, or become<br>\
introduced, or included, among them,] and not<br>\
belonging to them. (TA.) Pl. وَلَائِجُ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  وَلِيجَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A particular, or special, intimate,<br>\
friend, or associate, of a man; syn. خَاصَّةٌ (S,<br>\
K) and بِطَانَةٌ (S) and دَخِيلَةٌ: (K:) by these<br>\
syns. A&#39;Obeyd explains it in the Kur. ix. 16:<br>\
and it is applied to one and to more than one:<br>\
(TA:) or one whom a person takes to rely upon,<br>\
or to place confidence in, not being of his family:<br>\
(K:) and so some explain the word in the verse<br>\
above referred to: (TA:) or it there signifies an<br>\
intimate friend who is one of the polytheists. (Fr.)<br>\
وَالِجَةٌ i. q. دُبَيْلَةٌ, (K,) i. e., A certain disease<br>\
in the belly. (TA.) A pain that attacks a man;<br>\
or a pain in a man; وَجَعٌ يَأْخُذُ الإِنْسَانَ, (so in<br>\
two copies of the S, and in the L,) or وَجَعٌ<br>\
فِى الإِنْسَانِ: (so in the TA and a MS. copy<br>\
of the K:) or a pain that attacks the teeth;<br>\
or a pain in the teeth; وجع يأخذ الأَسْنَانَ,<br>\

تَوْلَجٌ The hiding place of a wild beast, (or<br>\
antelope, TA,) among trees, (S, K,) into which<br>\
he enters (الَّذِى يَلِج فِيهِ); like دَوْلَجٌ: the ت,<br>\
says Sb, is substituted for و, and the word is of<br>\
the measure فَوْعَلٌ; for تَفْعَلٌ is scarcely found<br>\
in Arabic as the measure of a subst., whereas<br>\
فَوْعَلٌ is frequent. (S.)<br>\
مَوْلِجٌ A place of entrance; a place into which<br>\
one enters: (TA:) pl. مَوَالِجُ. (S.) [See its<br>\

وَالِجَة, or دُبَيْلَة. (K, TA.)<br>\
