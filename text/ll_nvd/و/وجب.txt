[(May a disease be) in his side, or (may God<br>\
afflict him, or smite him, with a disease) in his<br>\
side, and may falling down upon the ground,<br>\

i. e. بجنبه داءٌ فلتكن الوجبه به; or رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ<br>\

given as an inf. n. unrestricted to the signification of a single act:] or the sound of a thing<br>\
falling (K) and producing a sound such as<br>\

-A2-  وَجَبَهٌ An eating but<br>\
once in the course of a day and night: (S, K:)<br>\
or an eating but once in a day until the like<br>\
eating in the following day: (K:) an inf. n.<br>\
(Lh) [restricted to the signification of a single<br>\
act]: you say, فُلَانٌ يَأْكُلُ وَجْبَةً Such a one eats<br>\
but once (T) in the course of the day and night.<br>\
(AZ, S.) [See also صَيْرَمٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  In a trad. respecting the expiation of an oath, it is said, يُطْعِمُ<br>\
عَشَرَةَ مَسَاكِينَ وَجْبَةً وَاحِدَةً [He shall feed ten<br>\

maintenance: syn. وَظِيفَةٌ: (K:) i. e., what a<br>\
man is accustomed to allow himself [each day] as<br>\

in the A is وَجْبَةٌ, q. v. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَجِيبَةٌ [A<br>\
term employed in the case of] one&#39;s concluding a<br>\
sale, and then taking it [meaning what is sold to<br>\
him] by regular successive portions, one after<br>\
another, (AA, S, K,) or, as some say, on the<br>\
condition of his taking a portion of it every day,<br>\
(TA,) until he has taken the whole of his وَجِيبَة:<br>\
(K:) [which hence appears to signify both the<br>\
act above described and also what is due to one<br>\
of a thing purchased and taken in this manner;<br>\
but more probably the latter is the only meaning<br>\
intended]. When a person has finished doing<br>\
this, one says to him قَدِ اسْتَوْفَيْتَ وَجِيبَتَكَ [Thou<br>\
hast taken the whole of what was due to thee of<br>\
the thing purchased and taken by thee in the<br>\
manner above described]. (S.)<br>\
[<br>\
وُجُوبِىٌّ Obligatory, or incumbent: opposed<br>\
to اِمْتِنَانِىٌّ.]<br>\
وَجَّابٌ and وجَّابَةٌ: see وَجْبٌ.<br>\
وَاجِبٌ Slain: (S:) dying; or dead. (TA.)<br>\
So in the following verse of Keys Ibn-ElKhateem:<br>\
أَطَاعَتْ بَنُو عَوْفٍ أَمِيرًا نَهَاهُمُ<br>\
عَنِ السِّلْمِ حَتَّى كَانَ أَوَّلَ وَاجِبِ<br>\
[The sons of &#39;Owf obeyed a commander who forbade them to make peace until he was the first<br>\
who was slain, or who died]. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  وَاجِبٌ<br>\
[act. part. n. of وَجَبَ; Necessary; requisite;<br>\
unavoidable: binding, incumbent, or obligatory.<br>\
In the science of the fundamentals of religion,<br>\
Necessarily being or existing; of which the<br>\
nonexistence cannot be mentally conceived: as<br>\
the essence of God. (IbrD.)] ―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to [the<br>\
Imám] Aboo-Haneefeh, وَاجِبٌ [in matters of<br>\
religion] is not so strong a term as فَرْضٌ: [and<br>\
so may be rendered incumbent, or obligatory;<br>\
or that which is a necessary, or indispensable,<br>\
duty; yet not so decisively or manifestly shown<br>\
to be such as that which is termed فرض:] or,<br>\
accord. to Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, these two terms are<br>\
syn., signifying [binding, incumbent, or obligatory, by God&#39;s express appointment, as] a<br>\
thing for neglecting which one will be punished:<br>\
and واجب signifies that which should be preferred and approved; thus explained by ElKhattábee as occurring in the following trad.:<br>\
غُسْلُ الجُمْعَةِ وَاجِبٌ عَلَى كُلِّ مُحْتَلِمٍ The<br>\
ablution prescribed to be performed on Friday is<br>\
an act which every one who has experienced a<br>\
nocturnal pollution should prefer and approve.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  فِعْلٌ وَاجِبٌ [A verb expressing an<br>\
event as a positive fact] is such, for instance, as<br>\
in the phrase بَيْنَمَا أَنَا كَذَا إِذْ جَآءَ زَيْدٌ [while I<br>\
was thus, or in [this state, lo, or behold, Zeyd<br>\
came]. (S, L, art. اذ.)<br>\
مُوجَبٌ An effect; that which is produced by<br>\
an operating cause; a result; a consequence.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  [كَلَامٌ مُوجَبٌ, lit. An affirmed sentence; i. q. مُثْبَتٌ as contr. of مَنْفِىٌّ; virtually<br>\
the same as ↓ كَلَامٌ مُوجِبٌ, an affirmative sentence.]<br>\
[<br>\
مَوْجِبٌ A place where one falls down and<br>\
dies; where one dies]. ―<br>\
-b2-  خَرَجَ القَوْمُ إِلَى<br>\
مَوَاجِبِهِمْ, i. e. الى مَصَارِعِهِمْ; The people went<br>\
forth to the places where they should be prostrated; or, as implied in the S, where they should<br>\
full down and die; or where they should die].<br>\
(S.)<br>\
-A2-  مُوجِبٌ [and ↓ مُوجِبَةٌ] A cause; an<br>\
efficient; that which produces, or effects, anything. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See كَلَامٌ مُوجَبٌ<br>\
-A3-  مُوجِبٌ<br>\
A name of the month المُحَرَّمُ (K) in ancient<br>\
times. (TA.)<br>\

punishment [in the world to come]: (TA:) or a<br>\
great sin, and also an act of great goodness,<br>\
which makes [the punishment of] hell, or [the<br>\
reward of] paradise, the consequence thereof<br>\
unless followed by repentance &amp;c.] (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
أَللّٰهُمَّ إِنِّى أَسْأَلُكَ مُوجِبَاتِ رَحْمَتِكَ [O God, I ask<br>\
of thee those things which will procure thy<br>\
mercy!]. (TA, from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See مُوجِبٌ.<br>\
مُوَجِّبٌ One who eats but once in the course of<br>\
a day and a night. (AZ, S.)<br>\
-A2-  مُوَجِّبٌ A beast<br>\
of carriage that is frightened at everything.<br>\
(ISd.) Not known to AM. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See وَجْبٌ<br>\
in two places.<br>\
أَللّٰهُ مُسْتَوْجِبٌ الحَمْدِ God is worthy, or deserving, of praise; has a right, or just title or claim,<br>\
to it; deserves it; merits it: syn. هُوَ وَلِيُّهُ, and<br>\
مُسْتَحِقُّهُ. (TA.)<br>\
