وَثَبَ, aor. يَثِبُ, inf. n. وَثْبٌ and وُثُوبٌ (the<br>\
latter agreeable with analogy, TA,) and وَثَبَانٌ<br>\
and وَثِيبٌ (S, K) and وِثاَبٌ (K; but this is<br>\
generally affirmed to be an inf. n. of وَاثَبَ, TA;)<br>\
and ثِبَةٌ, (Ibn-Málik and others) He leaped;<br>\
jumped; sprang; bounded: (S, K:) or he leaped<br>\
down, or downwards. (Mgh, Msb, art. طفر.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
وَثَبَ المَوْضِعَ [He leaped, or jumped, upon, or<br>\
over the place]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  وَثَبَ إِلَى الشَّرَفِ وَثْبَةً<br>\
(tropical:)  [He made a single leap to eminence, or<br>\
nobility]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  وَثَبَ إِلَيْهِ [app., He leaped,<br>\
or sprang up, or he hastened, to him]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
الوُثُوبُ, except in the dial. of Himyer, signifies<br>\
The act of rising, or standing up. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  It<br>\
is also much used by the vulgar as signifying<br>\
The act of hastening to a thing; as observed by<br>\
MF, who is wrong in saying that there is nothing<br>\
in the lexicons that favours its being so used.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  وَثَبَ, [aor. يَثِبُ,] inf. n. وَثْبٌ, in the<br>\
dial. of Himyer signifies He sat; sat down.<br>\
(K, TA, from a trad.) ثِبْ in that dial. signifies<br>\
Sit; sit down. (S.) It is related that Zeyd<br>\
Ibn-Abd-Allah Ibn-Dárim came as an envoy to<br>\
one of the kings of Himyer, and found him at a<br>\
hunting-place belonging to him, on a high<br>\
mountain, and he saluted him, and mentioned to<br>\
him his lineage, or relationship; whereupon the<br>\
king said to him ثِبْ, meaning إِجْلِسْ, Sit; but<br>\
the man thought that he commanded him to leap<br>\
from the mountain; and he said, “Thou shalt<br>\
find me, O king, very obedient: ” then he leaped<br>\
from the mountain, and perished. So the king<br>\
said, “What ailed him? ” And they explained<br>\
to him his case, and his mistake respecting the<br>\
word: upon which he said لَيْسَتْ عِنْدَنَا عَرَبِيَّتْ مَنْ<br>\
دَخَلَ ظَفَارِ حَمَّرَ i. e., [“ Arabic is not current with<br>\
us: ” (for, probably, in the time of this king, the<br>\
term عَرَبِيَّة was only applied to the general language of Arabia:) “ whoso entereth Dhafári,]<br>\
let him learn [or, rather, speak, as MF says,]<br>\
the Himyeree language. ” (Mz., 16th نوع.) [The<br>\
principal facts of this anecdote are also mentioned<br>\
in the S, on the authority of As.] By the king&#39;s<br>\
saying عَرَبِيَّتْ was meant العَرَبِيَّةُ: the ة is pronounced ت in the case of a pause (which is the<br>\
case here) in their dialect. (S.) Or, accord. to<br>\
another relation of the above anecdote, the king<br>\
said لَيْسَ عِنْدَنَا عَرَبِيَّتْ كَعَرَبِيَّتْكُمْ [“ Arabic like<br>\
your Arabic is not current with us: ”] and this,<br>\
says ISd, is the right reading in my opinion:<br>\
for the king did not mean to exclude himself<br>\
from the Arabs. (MF.)<br>\
