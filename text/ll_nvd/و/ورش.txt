the pretext of the warashán, thou eatest the fresh<br>\
ripe dates of the excellent kind called مشان]:<br>\
(S, A, K:) said to him who pretends one thing<br>\
and means another: (A, K:) originating from<br>\
the fact that some people employed a slave belonging to them to guard the fresh ripe dates of<br>\
their palm-trees, and he used to eat them, and,<br>\
when reproved for his evil conduct, laid the<br>\
blame upon the warashán; wherefore this was<br>\
said to him. (Sgh.)<br>\
وَارِشٌ One who comes in to a people uninvited,<br>\

but others say, that وارش has the first signification only, relating to food: and that of a sponger<br>\
desiring food. (TA.) See رَاشِنٌ and طُفَيْلِىٌّ.<br>\
