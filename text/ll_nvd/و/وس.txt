and simple subst. وسْوَاسٌ, but see ظأْظَأَ,] He<br>\
spoke, or talked, indistinctly: (TA:) [or in a<br>\
low, faint, gentle, or soft manner, with confusedness: for] Aboo-Turáb is related to have said,<br>\

speaking in a low, faint, gentle, or soft, manner,<br>\
with confusedness: or, accord. to one relation, it<br>\
is [وَشْوَشَةٌ,] with ش. (TA.) [It is generally<br>\

but sometimes trans.; for you say,] وَسْوَسَ الرَّجُلَ<br>\
