وَرَطَهَا He veiled, concealed, hid, or covered,<br>\
her, or it, or them; [to what the pronoun relates<br>\
is not said; but I incline to think that the right<br>\
reading is وَرَّطَهَا, and that the pronoun relates to<br>\
camels; (see 2;) as also ↓ اورطها: (L, TA:)<br>\
from IAar. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
ورّطهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَوْرِيطٌ, (S, Msb,)<br>\
He made him to fall into what is termed وَرْطَة<br>\
[properly and also tropically, or in its primary<br>\
sense and also in any of its subordinate senses];<br>\
as also ↓ اورطهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِيرَاطٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) both signify (assumed tropical:)  he made him to fall into<br>\
that from which he could not extricate himself:<br>\
(TA:) or into that from which he could not<br>\
easily extricate himself. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ورّط إِبِلَهُ<br>\
فى إِبِلٍ أَخْرَى (assumed tropical:)  He hid, or concealed, his camels<br>\
among other camels [in order that they might<br>\
escape the notice of the collector of the<br>\
poor-rates]; as also ↓ اورط. (K.) [See also<br>\

وِرَاطٌ (S, Msb, TA) and مُوَارَطَةٌ (TA) [The<br>\
act of mutually making to fall into what is termed<br>\
وَرْطَة.<br>\
-A2-  And hence,] (assumed tropical:)  The act of mutually<br>\
deceiving, beguiling, or circumventing; or endeavouring to deceive, beguile, or circumvent;<br>\
(TA;) or the act of deceiving, beguiling, or circumventing; (S, Msb;) and the acting, or<br>\
advising, or counselling, dishonestly, or insincerely; (S, Msb, TA;) and ↓ وَرْطٌ and ↓ وِرَاطَةٌ,<br>\
the latter on the authority of J, [accord. to some<br>\
copies of the S, but in other copies وِرَاطٌ,] signify<br>\
the same [as substs.] (TA.) You say, لَا تُوَارِطْ<br>\
جَارَكَ فَإِنَّ الوِرَاطَ يُورِدُ الأَوْراَطَ (assumed tropical:)  [Do not thou<br>\
practise mutual deceit with thy neighbour, or<br>\
endeavour to deceiving him, &amp;c., for the doing so<br>\
brings upon its author things, or affairs, from<br>\
which it is difficult to escape]. (Z, TA.) And<br>\
it is said in trad, لَا خِلَاطَ وَلَا وِرَاطَ, which is like<br>\
his [Mohammad&#39;s] saying, (assumed tropical:)  There shall be no<br>\
putting together what is separate, nor separating<br>\
what is put together, from fear of the poor-rate:<br>\
(S:) خلاط has been explained in its place:<br>\
(TA:) وراط [has also been variously explained<br>\
in that place, and, it is said,] signifies the putting<br>\
together what is separate: and the reverse: (K:)<br>\
or the dispersing camels (K, TA) among other<br>\
camels: (TA:) or the hiding camels among<br>\
other camels; (Th, K;) or in a low, or depressed,<br>\
piece of ground; in order that the collector of<br>\
the poor-rate may not see them: (K:) or the<br>\
making one another to fall into a وَرْطَة, (TA,)<br>\
one saying to the collector of the poor-rate,<br>\
“ Such a one has that for which a poor-rate is<br>\
due,” when he has not; (K, TA;) so accord. to<br>\
IAar: accord. to Ibn-Háni, it is from أَوْرَطَ<br>\
الجَرِيرَ فِى عُنُقِ البَعِيِرِ. (TA.) See 4.<br>\

الجَرِيرَ فِى عُنُقِ البَعِير (assumed tropical:)  He put the end of the<br>\
جرير [q. v.] of the camel into its ring, and then<br>\

تورّط فِى وَرْطَةٍ He fell into what is termed<br>\
وَرْطَة [properly and also tropically, or in its<br>\
primary sense, and also in any of its subordinate<br>\
senses]. (S.) You say, تورّطتِ الغَنَمُ وَغَيْرُهَا The<br>\
sheep, or goats, &amp;c., fell into mud from which they<br>\
could not extricate themselves; or into a depressed<br>\
piece of ground in which was no way directing<br>\
to escape: and hence the verb is used in relation<br>\
to any straitness or difficulty. (Msb.) Thus you<br>\
say, تورّط فُلَانٌ فِى الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one undertook,<br>\
or embarked in, the affair, and could not easily<br>\
extricate himself; and so فيه ↓ استورط: (Msb:)<br>\
or the former signifies (assumed tropical:)  he fell into the affair,<br>\
or case: (K:) or (assumed tropical:)  he became entangled in the<br>\
affair, and could not easily extricate himself<br>\
from it; (TA;) and so ↓ the latter: (Sh, K,<br>\
TA:) and تورّط and ↓ استورط both signify he<br>\
stuck fast: or (assumed tropical:)  he perished; or died. (TA.)<br>\

إِسْتَوْرَطَ see 5, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  استورط مَعَ فُلَانٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He behaved proudly, haughtily, or insolently,<br>\
in speech, with such a one. (TA.)<br>\
وَرْطٌ: see 3.<br>\
وَرْطَهٌ Slime, or thin mud, [in the CK, الرَّحْلُ<br>\
is erroneously put for الوَحْلُ,] into which sheep or<br>\
goats fall, and from which they cannot extricate<br>\
themselves: (Msb, K:) this, or, as some say,<br>\
what here next follows, is the primary signification: (Msb:) a low, or depressed, piece of ground<br>\
or land, in which is no way, or road, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) directing to escape: (Msb:) this is said by<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd to be the primary signification: (S:)<br>\
a deep hollow, cavity, or pit, in the ground:<br>\
(TA:) a deep hollow, cavity, or pit, formed for<br>\
the purpose of a stratagem, such as may be in a<br>\
mountain, occasioning difficulty to him who falls<br>\
into it: (As:) and hence, (TA,) a well: (K,<br>\
TA:) and anything that is غَامِض [app. here<br>\
meaning low, or depressed]: (K:) also, by<br>\
derivation from the first of these significations, (Msb,) or from the second, (S, Msb,)<br>\
[or some other,] (assumed tropical:)  perdition; or destruction;<br>\
or death: (S, Msb, K:) and (assumed tropical:)  [any embarrassing, or difficult, case, or affair;] any<br>\
case, or affair, from which escape is difficult: (K:) pl. [of pauc.] أَوْرَاطٌ, (S, IS,) the<br>\
ة in the sing. being app. regarded as elided;<br>\
(IS;) and [of mult.] وِرَاطٌ, (K,) and وَرَطَاتٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\

إِسْتٌ. (K, TA.)<br>\
