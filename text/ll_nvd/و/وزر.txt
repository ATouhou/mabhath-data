kesr, (K,) He bore, or carried, a heavy load,<br>\
or burden. (A, Mgh, K.) It is said in the<br>\
Kur, [vi. 164, &amp;c.,] وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى<br>\
Nor shall any [soul] bearing [a heavy burden]<br>\
bear the [heavy] burden of another soul; (S;) i. e.,<br>\
its burden of sin: (Mgh, Msb:) meaning, that<br>\
no one shall be punished for the sin of another;<br>\
nor shall any sinning soul bear the heavy burden<br>\
of another soul; every one shall be requited for<br>\
his [own] deeds: (TA:) or nor shall any sinning<br>\
[soul] sin by the sin of another. (Akh, S, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (Akh, S,) وَزَرَ, (Akh, S, A, Msb, K,)<br>\
aor. يَزِرُ; and وَزِرَ, aor. يَوْزَرُ; (Akh, S, A, Msb,<br>\
K;) and وُزِرَ (the same and A,) aor. يُوزَرُ; (Akh,<br>\
S, K;) inf. n. وِزْرٌ and وَزْرٌ and زِرَةٌ, (K,) or<br>\
وِزْرَةٌ, accord. to Zj, as I have seen it [says IM]<br>\
pointed and well written; (L;) (tropical:)  He sinned:<br>\
(Akh, S, A, K:) or he bore [a burden of] sin-<br>\
(Msb.) See also 8. ―<br>\
-b3-  وُزِرَ also signifies (tropical:)  He<br>\
was charged with, or accused of, a sin. (K, *<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  وَزَرَ لِلْأَمِيرِ, (A,) and لِلْسُّلْطَانِ, (Msb,<br>\
[this I believe to be the right reading; but in<br>\
the only copy of the Msb, that I have, I find it<br>\
written السلطان;]) aor. يَزِرُ; (A, Msb;) inf. n.<br>\
وَزَارَةٌ; (A;) and لِلْأَمِيرِ ↓ توزّر, (S.) or لَلْمَلِكِ;<br>\
(K;) and ↓ وَازرهُ; (S, K;) (tropical:)  He was, or became,<br>\
وَزِير [or vicegerent] (S, A, Msb, K) to the governor,<br>\

[Hence,] وازر المَلِكَ أَعْبَآءَ المُلْكِ (tropical:)  He bore with<br>\

الأَمْرِ, (TA,) inf. n. مُوَازَرَةٌ, (A, TA,) He aided,<br>\
assisted, or helped, him, and strengthened him, to<br>\
do the thing: originally آزَرَهُ: (A, * TA:) the<br>\
former of these, وازره, is the more chaste. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اوزرهُ He appointed him a وَزَر, (K, TA,)<br>\
i. e., a place of refuge to which to betake himself.<br>\

copy, the syn. is written without syll. signs:]<br>\
and K [in which it is written ثِقَل:]) pl. أَوْزَارٌ.<br>\
(Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  A weapon; an instrument of<br>\
war: or weapons; arms: syn. سِلَاحٌ: (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K:) because heavy upon the wearer:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) or أَوْزَارٌ signifies the burdens and<br>\
instruments of war, &amp;c.; and the sing. is وِزْرٌ;<br>\

some. (TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely El-Aashà,<br>\

وَأَعْدَدْتُ لِلْحَرْبِ أَوْزَارَهَا<br>\
رِمَاحًا طِوَالًا وَخَيْلًا ذُكُورَا<br>\
[And I prepared for the war its weapons and<br>\
other apparatus; long lances and male horses].<br>\
(S, Mgh, TA.) And it is said in the Kur,<br>\
[xlvii. 5,] حَيَّى تَضَعَ الْحَرْبُ أَوْزَارَهَا, meaning,<br>\
(tropical:)  Until the war terminates: (Mgh, Msb:) because<br>\
then the people thereof lay down their arms:<br>\
(Mgh:) properly, until the people of the war lay<br>\
down their burdens: (Msb:) their weapons and<br>\
burdens: or, as some say, their sins. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
(tropical:)  A sin: (S, Bd, ubi supra, and Msb, K:) and<br>\
[especially] polytheism: (Fr, Bd, TA:) pl. as<br>\
above. (Bd, Msb, &amp;c.) This is the sense in<br>\
which it is most frequently used in the traditions.<br>\
(IAth.)<br>\
وَزَرٌ A mountain: this is the primary signification: (S:) or a mountain difficult of access, or<br>\
strong: (K, TK:) or a mountain to which one<br>\
betakes himself for refuge: this is the primary<br>\
signification. (Aboo-Is-hák.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A place of<br>\
refuge: (S, Msb, K:) any such place. (Aboo-Is-hák, K.) So in the Kur, lxxv. 11. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  See also وَزِيرٌ.<br>\
وَزِيرٌ i. q. مُوَازِرٌ [One who bears a burden or<br>\
burdens with another: or one who aids, assists or<br>\
helps, and strengthens, another: see 3:] (S, A, K:)<br>\
like as أَكِيلٌ signifies i. q. مُؤَاكِلٌ, (S,) and<br>\
جَلِيسٌ i. q. مُجَالِسٌ. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  [A vicegerent of<br>\
a king or the like: or a confidential minister of<br>\
state: in English commonly written vizier, in<br>\
imitation of the Turkish pronunciation; but properly, wezeer:] the familiar of the king, who<br>\
bears his master&#39;s burden, and aids him by his<br>\
counsel: (K:) or the وزير of the king is the<br>\
person who bears with him (يُوَازِرُهُ, i. e. يُحَامِلُهُ,)<br>\
the burdens of the regal office: not from مُوَازَرَةٌ,<br>\
signifying the “ act of aiding or the like,” because<br>\
the و in this latter word is substituted for ء, and<br>\
the derivative from it of the measure فَعِيلٌ is<br>\
أَزِيرٌ: (A:) ISd says, some hold that the و in وزير<br>\
is substituted for ء; but Abu-l-&#39;Abbás says, that<br>\
this is not agreeable with analogy; for the substitution of ء for و in a word of this measure is<br>\
rare, and that of و for ء is more strange: (TA:)<br>\
the وزير is so called because he bears for the king<br>\
the burden of administration: (S, * Msb:) or it<br>\
is from ↓ وَزَرٌ, signifying “ a mountain to which<br>\
one has recourse to save himself from destruction: ” so the وزير of the khaleefeh is one upon<br>\
whose counsel the khaleefeh relies in his affairs,<br>\
and to whom he betakes himself for refuge or<br>\
safety: (Aboo-Is-hák, TA:) pl. وُزَرَآءُ (A, Msb,<br>\
K) and أَوْزَارٌ; (A, K;) the latter like أَشْرَافٌ and<br>\
أَيْتَامٌ, (A, TA,) pls. of شَرِيفٌ and يَتِيمٌ. (TA.)<br>\
وِزَارَةٌ and وَزَارَةٌ The condition, or office, of a<br>\
وَزِير: (S, Msb, K:) the former word is the more<br>\
approved. (ISk, Msb.)<br>\
وَازِرٌ Bearing, or carrying, a heavy load, or<br>\
burden. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] also, (A,) and ↓ مَوْزُورٌ,<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K,) (tropical:)  Sinning: (S, A, K:) or bearing [a burden of] sin. (Msb.) مَأْزُورَاتٍ occurs<br>\
in a trad., for مَوْزُورَاتٍ, the regular form, because<br>\
it is there coupled with مَأْجُورَاتٍ, to which it is<br>\
opposed. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.)<br>\
مَوْزُورٌ: see وَازِرٌ.<br>\
