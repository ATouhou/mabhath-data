and [of mult.] وُجُرٌ. (K.) A poet uses the expression كِلَابُ وِجَارٍ, applying وجار metaphorically to the place of the dog: but it is not<br>\
improbable that the correct relation may be ضِبَاعُ<br>\
وِجَارٍ: though it may be allowable to call hyenas<br>\
كَلَاب, as her young ones are called جِرَآء. (M.)<br>\
