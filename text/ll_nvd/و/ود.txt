وَدَّهُ, first pers. وَدِدْتُ, (S, M, L, Msb,<br>\
K, &amp;c.) and وَدَدْتُ, (Ks, Z, K,) [but most disallow this] aor. يَوَدُّ, inf. n. وُدٌّ and وِدٌّ and وَدٌّ,<br>\
(S, M, L, K,) of which three forms the first is<br>\
the most common, (MF,) and مَوَدَّةٌ, (S, M, L,<br>\
K,) or this last is a simple subst., (Msb,) and<br>\
مِوَدَّةٌ (CK and some MS. copies of the K) and<br>\
مَوِدَّةٌ, (accord. to some other copies of the K,<br>\
this and the next preceding deviating from the<br>\
common forms of inf. ns., TA,) and مَوْدِدَةٌ (M,<br>\
Kz, K) and مَوْدَدَةٌ, (TA,) but these last two are<br>\
allowable only in poetry, and deviate from constant rule, the former doubly, (Kz, MF, TA,)<br>\
and وِدَادٌ and وَدَادٌ and وُدَادٌ, (M, L, K,) the first<br>\
of which last three forms is the most common,<br>\
(MF,) and وَدَادَةٌ (M, L, K) and, accord. to some,<br>\
وِدَادَةٌ and وُدَادَةٌ, (MF, TA,) and, as in a copy<br>\
of the K esteemed of good authority, مَوْدُودَةٌ,<br>\
(TA,) He loved, or affected, him, or it, (S, M,<br>\
L, Msb, K,) i. e. any means of attaining or doing<br>\
good. (AZ, M, L.) The form وَدَدْتُ is disallowed by the Basrees who hold it to be erroneous: and Zj says, We know that Ks did not<br>\
mention وَدَدْتُ without having heard it; but he<br>\
heard it from him who was no authority. (T, L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  أَوْدِدْهُ, an imp. form [of ↓ أَوَدَّهُ], without<br>\
idghám, accord. to the dial. of El-Hijáz, occurs<br>\
in a trad., meaning Love thou it, or affect it.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  وَدِدْتُ لَوْ تَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ. and وَدَدْتُ لَوْ أَنَّكَ<br>\
تَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ, (S, L,) aor. as above, inf. n. وُدٌّ and<br>\
وَدٌّ and وَدَادَةٌ (S, L, Msb) and وَدَادٌ (S, L) or<br>\
وِدَادٌ, (T, in TT,) I wished that thou wouldest do<br>\
that. (S, L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  وَدِدْتُ لَوْ كَانَ كَذَا I wished<br>\
that it had been so. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  وَدِدْتُ الشَّىْءَ I<br>\
wished for the thing. Fr says, This is the more<br>\
approved form; but some say وَدَدْتُ: in both<br>\
cases the aor. is يَوَدَّ only. (L.) [Respecting<br>\
the latter form of the pret., see above.] This is<br>\
a secondary signification of the verb. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
وادّهُ, inf. n. مُوَادَّةٌ and وِدَادٌ, He loved, or<br>\
affected him, being loved, or affected, by him.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
4<br>\

تودّدهُ He attracted to himself his love, or<br>\
affection. (IAar, L, K.) ―<br>\

two love, or affect, each other. (S, L, K.)<br>\

(S, L, Msb) and ↓ وَدِيدٌ (TA) and ↓ وَادٌّ (Kz)<br>\
A person who loves; loving; affectionate: (S,<br>\
L, Msb, TA:) the first also used in a pl. sense,<br>\
(L, K,) being [originally] an inf. n. (TA) and<br>\
the second used alike as masc. and fem. (S, L,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\

senses; (L;) and أَوُدٌّ, (S, L, K,) pl. of وُدٌّ (TA)<br>\
in the second of the above senses; (K;) or of<br>\

or quasi-pl. n., upon which I find no remark,] in<br>\
the first of the above senses, (L,) or the second;<br>\
(K;) and وُدَّادٌ, pl. of وَادٌّ; (Kz;) and أَوِدَّآءُ, (S,<br>\

above senses; (K;) and وُدَدَآءُ, pl. of وَدُودٌ (S) in<br>\
the second of the above senses, (S, K,) [and the<br>\
third]; and وَدِيدٌ is also mentioned as a pl. in<br>\
the second of the above senses in the K; but<br>\
this is probably a mistake for وِدَادٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
IAth says, that ↓ وُدٌّ, used as an epithet, is for<br>\
ذُو وُدٍّ; but وِدٌّ does not require ذو to be understood, being syn. with صَدِيقٌ. (L.)<br>\

a certain idol belonging to Kureysh, also called<br>\

-A2-  وَدٌّ A wooden pin, peg,<br>\
or stake; i. q. وَتِدٌ: (S, K:) of the dial. of<br>\
Temeem; (IDrd;) or of Nejd: as though they<br>\
made the ت quiescent and incorporated it into<br>\
the د. (S.)<br>\
وُدٌّ: see 1, and وِدٌّ, and وَدٌّ. ―<br>\
-b2-  بِوُدِّى أَنْ يَكُونَ<br>\
كَذَا I wish that such a thing may be. In the<br>\
following saying of the poet,<br>\

interpretation. (TA.)<br>\
