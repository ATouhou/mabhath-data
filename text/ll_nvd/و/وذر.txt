وَذِرَهُ, of the same measure as وَسِعَهُ, (S, K,<br>\
TA,) or وَذَرَهُ, (Lth, ISk, T, TA,) is the original<br>\
pret. of which the aor. is يَذَرُهُ (Lth, ISk, T, S,<br>\
K, TA) signifying, He leaves, lets alone, or<br>\
ceases or desists from, it, or him; he leaves it<br>\
undone; syn. يَدَعُهُ, (ISk, T, S, K, TA,) and<br>\
يَتْرُكُهُ; (Msb;) imp. ذَرْهُ, syn. دَعْهُ: (ISk, T, S,<br>\
K, TA:) but the pret. is not used, (Lth, Sb,<br>\
ISk, T, S, M, Msb, K,) تَرَكَهُ being used in its<br>\
stead; (Lth, T, S, TA;) and because its pret.<br>\
is not used, the aor. is of the measure يَفْعَلُ; for<br>\
if there were a pret., [it would most probably be<br>\
of the measure فَعَلَ, as this is the regular measure<br>\
of trans. unaugmented triliteral verbs, and] the<br>\
aor. would be of the measure يَفْعُلُ or يَفْعِلُ: (Sb,<br>\
M, TA:) nor is the inf. n. used, (Lth, T, M,<br>\
Msb, K, TA,) تَرْكٌ being used in its stead, (Lth,<br>\
T, M, TA,) i. e., instead of وَذْرٌ: (K:) nor is the<br>\
act. part. n., (ISk, T, S, Msb, K,) namely وَاذِرٌ,<br>\
instead of which تَارِكٌ is used: (ISk, T, S:) or<br>\
the pret. is sometimes used, (Msb, K,) though<br>\
rarely, (Msb,) or by the deviation from the constant course of speech: (K:) so in the K; but<br>\
in the M it is said, that the phrase لَمْ أَذِرْ وَرَآئِى<br>\
شَيْئًا [I left not behind me anything, with kesr<br>\
to the ذ, and so in the original copy of the TT,]<br>\
is related on the authority of some of the Arabs.<br>\
(TA.) You say, ذَرْ ذَا and دَعْ ذَا [Leave thou, or<br>\
let alone, or cease or desist from, this]. (ISk,<br>\
T.) It is said in the Kur, [lxxiii. 11,] وَذَرْنِى<br>\
وَالْمُكَذِّبِينَ And leave me, or let me alone, with<br>\
the beliers, or descrediters; (Bd;) commit their<br>\
case to me, (Bd, TA,) and busy not thy heart<br>\
respecting them; (TA;) for I will stand thee<br>\
in stead to recompense them. (Bd.)<br>\
