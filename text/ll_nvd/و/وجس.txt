[An intelligent person, acquainted with the circumvention of game: see دَاوَرَهُ]: (M, art. دور:)<br>\
(ISd holds it to be a possessive epithet, since it<br>\
has no known verb [of a suitable meaning that<br>\
is unaugmented]: or [the meaning of these<br>\
words is, a person possessing skill in circumventing game, a listener, or attentive, to their sounds<br>\
and motions; for], accord. to Es-Sukkaree, رجّاس<br>\
means يَتَوَجَّسُ. (TA.)<br>\

his abode, any food; (El-Umawee, S;) and [in<br>\
like manner] ↓ وَجْسًا. (TA.) And مَافِى سِقَائِهِ<br>\
أَوْجَسُ There is not in his skin a drop: thus the<br>\
phrase is given, without the mention of beverage:<br>\
or a drop of water. (TA.) It is said that the word<br>\
is not used except in negative phrases. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also, الأَوْجَسُ and الأَوْجُسُ (S, K) the latter<br>\
on the authority of Yaakoob, (S, TA,) but the<br>\
former is the more chaste, (TA,) Time; syn.<br>\
الدِّهْرَ. (S, K.) Hence the saying, (TA,) لَاأَفْعَلُهُ<br>\
سَجِيسَ الأَوْجَسِ, (S, K,) and الأَوْجُسِ, (S,) I<br>\
will not do it ever. (ISk, S, K.) And أَفْعَلُهُ<br>\
سَجِيسَ عُجَِيْسَ الأَوْجَسٍ I will not do it while<br>\
time lasts. (El-Fárisee.)<br>\
