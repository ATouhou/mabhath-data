certain mode, or manner, of walking, &amp;c. ”].<br>\

distinction [excepting that the second verb<br>\
relates to the grape rather than the date] is<br>\
meant in the K; the passage presenting what is<br>\
termed لَفٌّ وَنَشْرٌ مُرَتَّبٌ:) or the latter verb signifies it (a grape or a date) showed some degree<br>\
