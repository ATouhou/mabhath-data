وَطِئَ, aor. يَطَأُ; (S, K;) the و, falls out<br>\
from the aor. of this verb, and from that of<br>\
وَسِعَ, because they are transitive; for other<br>\
verbs of the class فَعِلَ, having the aor. of the<br>\
measure يَفْعَلُ, and the first radical letter infirm,<br>\
are intransitive; and as these two differ from<br>\
their class in being transitive, they are also<br>\
made to differ in the aor.; (S;) or يَطَأُ was<br>\
originally يَطِئُ, and therefore the و, falls out<br>\
from it; (TA;) inf. n. وَطْءٌ, (TA) [and طِئَةٌ, q.v.<br>\
infra]; and ↓ وطّأ, (K, but this has an intensive<br>\
signification, MF;) and ↓ توطّأ (S, K) He trod;<br>\
trod upon; (بِرِجْلِهِ with his foot; S) trod under<br>\
foot; trampled upon: (S, K, TA:) or وَطِئَهُ<br>\

with his hand or his foot. (TA, in art. ثطأ.)<br>\
[See also وَطْأَةٌ.] ―<br>\

ground with the soles of both thy fect; because<br>\
Mohammad raised one of his feet in prayer.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  هُمْ يَطَؤُهُمُ الطَّرِيقُ (tropical:)  They (i. e. the<br>\
sons of such a one) sojourn, or encamp, near the<br>\
road, so that its passengers tread upon them<br>\
[i. e., became their guests]: (Sb, K:) a tropical<br>\
phrase, in which الطريق is put for أَهْلُ الطَّرِيقِ;<br>\
this being done to give greater force to the<br>\
phrase, as it is one expressive of praise; for the<br>\
road is a thing that is constant; whereas its<br>\
passengers are sometimes upon it, and sometimes<br>\
absent. (L.) [It means They are a people who<br>\
take up their abode near the road in order that<br>\
many passengers may enjoy their hospitality.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  [See also طَرِيقٌ.] ―<br>\

طَأَةٌ (TA, as from the K) [and, app., طِئَةٌ, q.v.<br>\
infra], It (a place, S) was plain, level, smooth,<br>\
soft, or easy to be travelled, or to walk, or ride<br>\
or lie upon. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  كُنْتُ أَطَأُ ذِكْرَهُ<br>\

(S) and وِطَآءٌ; (TA;) and ↓ تواطأهُ and ↓ توطّأهُ;<br>\
(K;) (tropical:)  He agreed, or concurred, with him<br>\
respecting a thing. (S, K.) The radical signification of واطأ is said to be He trod in the<br>\
footsteps of another: and the signification of<br>\
agreement is therefore figurative. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
فُلَانٌ يُوَاطِئُ اسْمُهُ اسْمِى (tropical:)  [Such a one&#39;s name<br>\

contention, or dispute. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  In a trad. it<br>\
is said, that the pastors of the camels, and the<br>\
shepherds, boasted, one party over the other,<br>\
and the former overcame the latter (اوطؤوهم).<br>\
(TA.) The verb is used in this sense because it<br>\
originally signifies, with the annexed pronoun,<br>\
they made (others) to tread, or trample, upon<br>\
them: (K, TA:) for him with whom you<br>\
wrestle or fight, and whom you throw down,<br>\

changed into ا; (TA;) He repeated a rhyme in<br>\
a poem, (S, K,) using the same word in the same<br>\
sense: (Akh, K:) when the word is the same,<br>\
but the meaning different, the repetition is not<br>\
called ايطاء [but جِنَاسٌ تَامٌّ]. (TA.) This repetition (ايطاء) is deemed by Arabs a fault: or<br>\
it is only deemed a fault if it occur two, or<br>\
three, or more, times. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَوَطَّاَ See 1, 2, 3. ―<br>\

copy of the K,) measure إِفْتَعَلَ [in the TA<br>\
