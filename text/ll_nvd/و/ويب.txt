load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'ويبوَيْبٌ a word like وَيْلٌ (S, K) and وَيْحٌ and<br>\
وَيْسٌ: these four words agree in form and meaning, and have no fifth; although some of the<br>\
lexicologists differ, in holding that some of them<br>\
relate to what is good, and others to the falling<br>\
into destruction. Accord. to what is said by<br>\
Z, in the Fáïk, ويب and ويح and ويس denote<br>\
compassion: but ويل is used in reviling, and<br>\
imprecating destruction. (MF.) IKtt says, in<br>\
the Tahdheeb el-Af&#39;ál, that the invariable verbs<br>\
are nine in number: نِعْمَ and بِئْسُ and لَيْسَ and<br>\
عَسَى and the verb of wonder and وَيْحَ زَيْدٍ and<br>\
وَيْبَهُ and وَيْلَهُ and وَيْسَهُ; but that El-Mázinee<br>\
asserts the last four to be inf. ns. (TA.) You<br>\
say وَيْبَكَ, (S, K,) and وَيْبٌ لَكَ, and وَيْبٌ لِزَيْدٍ,<br>\
and وَيْبًا لَهُ, and وَيْبٍ لَهُ, (K,) with the three<br>\
different vowel-terminations, both in addressing<br>\
a person and in speaking of one who is absent,<br>\
(TA,) and وَيْبِهِ, and وَيْبِ غَيْرِهِ, (K,) [and وَيْبَ<br>\
غَيْرِكَ, (see below,)] and وَيْبَ زَيْدٍ, (S, K,) and<br>\
وَيْبِ زَيْدٍ, (TA,) [and وَيْبُ زَيْدٍ, (see below,)] and<br>\
وَيْبِ فُلَانٌ on the authority of IAar, (K,) who<br>\
adds, except the بنو اسد, who, it appears, from<br>\
his saying this, give fet-h to the ب: (TA:) the<br>\
meaning of all which is, May God make woe<br>\
(ويل) to cleave to thee! [and ―<br>\
-b2-  to Zeyd! &amp;c.:<br>\
or Woe to thee! &amp;c.: but see what is said<br>\
above.] (S, K.) Dhu-l-Khirak Et-Tuhawee uses<br>\
ويب in the sense of ويل, addressing to a wolf<br>\
the ejaculation وَيْبَ غَيْرِكَ, [which is therefore the<br>\
same in meaning as وَيْبَكَ]: (TA:) but accord.<br>\
to what is said by Z, in the Fáïk, وَيْبَكَ and<br>\
وَيْبٌ لَكَ &amp;c. signify Mercy on thee! or the like.<br>\
(MF.) When ويب is put in the acc. case, it is<br>\
so put as an inf. n. (S.) This is the opinion<br>\
generally obtaining: the opinion that وَيْبَ is a<br>\
verb is extraordinary. (TA.) When you use<br>\
the prep. ل, you [generally say] وَيْبٌ لِزَيْدٍ (or<br>\
وَيْبًا لِزَيْدٍ, L): when you use ل, it is more<br>\
elegant to put ويب in the nom. case, as an inchoative, than in the acc. case: but when you<br>\
use ويب as a prefixed noun, with its complement,<br>\
the acc. is more elegant than the nom. case:<br>\
[i. e., it is more elegant to say وَيْبَ زَيْدٍ than<br>\
وَيْبُ زَيْدٍ]. (S, L.) Ks says, Some of the Arabs<br>\
say وَيْبَكَ and وَيْبَ غَيْرِكَ; and some of them say<br>\
وَيْبًا لِزَيْدٍ, like وَيْلًا لِزَيْدٍ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  وَيْبًا لِهَذَا الأَمْرِ<br>\
(K, * TA) i. q. عَجَبًا لَهُ, [I] wonder at, or with<br>\
respect to, this thing! (K,) and so وَيْبَهُ. (TA.)<br>\
وَيْبَةٌ A measure consisting of twenty-two, or<br>\
twenty-four, أَمْدَاد (pl. of مُدٌّ), which see in art.<br>\
مك. (K.) Not mentioned by J nor by IF;<br>\
and IDrd doubted respecting it. In truth it is<br>\
a post-classical word, used by the people of<br>\
Syria and Egypt and Africa Proper. (TA.)<br>\
[At present, the ويبة in Cairo is the sixth part<br>\
of an إِرْدَبّ, which latter is equivalent, very<br>\
nearly, to five English bushels.]<br>\
