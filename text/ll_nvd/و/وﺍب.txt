should be ashamed: (S, K:) or he made him<br>\

though there were no difference of opinion respecting it:] or he turned him, or drove him, back<br>\
with ignominy, from his affair, or from the<br>\
object of his want: (so in the copies of the K;<br>\
but in an old copy, relied upon as correct, of the<br>\
Tahdheeb el-Af&#39;ál, from his companion, عن<br>\
صاحبه: TA:) as also ↓ اِتَّأَبَهُ; (K;) meaning he<br>\
turned him, or drove him, back with ignominy:<br>\
