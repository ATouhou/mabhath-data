وَحَدَ, aor. يَحِدُ; (T, L, Msb;) and وَحِدَ,<br>\
(Lh, M, L, K,) aor. يَوْحَدُ (Lh) and يَحِدُ; (K;)<br>\
with the latter aor., like وَرِثَ, aor. يَرِثُ; but وَحِدَ<br>\
with this aor. is not mentioned by the lexicologists or grammarians [except F]; (MF;) [and<br>\
its aor. is therefore probably يَوْحَدُ, only, agreeably with analogy, for which reason it seems to<br>\
be omitted in the M;] and وَحُدَ, (Lh, M, L,<br>\
Msb, K,) aor. also يَحِدُ; (K;) but this is<br>\
without a parallel, and without any authority<br>\
[except F]; (MF;) or يَوْحَدُ; (L;) [but this is<br>\
also extr., and is probably a mistake for يَوْحُدُ,<br>\
which is the form agreeable with analogy;]<br>\
inf. n. حِدَةٌ (T, M, L, Msb, K) and وَحْدٌ (M,<br>\
L, K) and وَحَدٌ (L) and وَحْدَةٌ, (L, K,) or<br>\
وُحْدَةٌ, (as in some copies of the K and in the<br>\
TA) and وُحُودٌ (K) and وَحَادَةٌ (M, L, Msb, K)<br>\
and وُحُودَةٌ; (K;) He, or it, was, or became,<br>\
alone, by himself or itself, apart from others;<br>\
(T, L, Msb;) as also [↓ إِتَّحَدَ; and ↓ توحّد;<br>\
and] ↓ استوحد; (A:) he was, or became, alone,<br>\
without anyone to cheer him by his society, company, or conversation: (L:) he remained alone,<br>\
by himself, apart from others; (Lh, M, L,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ توحّد. (M, L, K.) See also 5,<br>\
below.<br>\
2<br>\
وحّدهُ, (inf. n. تَوْحِيدٌ, K,) He made it one;<br>\
or called it one: (K:) like as one says ثَنَاهُ, and<br>\
ثَلَّثَهُ: (S, L:) as also أَحَّدَهُ. (TA.) Similar<br>\
verbs are formed from the other nouns significant of numbers, to عَشَرَةٌ. (Esh-Sheybánee,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وحّد لِامْرَأَتِهِ, or عِنْدَهَا, He remained one<br>\
night with his wife: and in like manner the verb<br>\
is used in relation to any saying or action.<br>\

asserted, or declared, God to be one: he asserted,<br>\
declared, or preferred belief in, the unity of God:<br>\
as also احّدهُ. (T, L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  التَّوْحِيدُ The belief in<br>\
God alone; (L, K;) in his unity. (L.)<br>\

اوحد اللّٰهُ جَانِبَهُ [God rendered him solitary]; i. e., he remained alone; (K;) or was<br>\
made to remain alone. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اوحدهُ لِلْأَعْدَآءِ<br>\
He left him [alone] to the enemies. (L, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
اوحدهُ He (God) made him the unequalled one<br>\
of his time: (S, L, K:) made him to have no<br>\
equal. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اوحدهُ النَّاسُ The people left<br>\

(AZ, L, K.)<br>\
وَحْدٌ: see 1, and وَحِيدٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  رَأَيْتُهُ وَحْدَهُ<br>\
(S, L, K) I saw him alone. (S, L.) وحد is<br>\
here an inf. n., having no dual nor pl. (K.)<br>\
The Koofees hold it to be in the acc. case as<br>\
an adv. n. of place: the Basrees, as an inf. n.,<br>\
in every instance; as though thou saidst أَوْحَدْتُهُ<br>\
بِرُؤْيَتِى إِبحَادًا, meaning “ I saw none save him,”<br>\
and then substituted وحده: or, as Abu-l-&#39;Abbás<br>\
says, it may mean the man&#39;s being himself<br>\
alone; as though thou saidst رَأَيْتُ رَجُلًا مُنْفَرِدًا<br>\
اِنْفِرَادًا, and then substituted وحده. (S.) Or<br>\
it is in the acc. case as a denotative of state<br>\
accord. to the Basrees [and the grammarians in<br>\
general]; not as an inf. n., J being in error in<br>\
what he says on this matter: (IB, K:) the<br>\
Basrees hold it to be a noun occupying the<br>\
place of an inf. n. in the acc. case as a denotative<br>\
of state; like جَآءَ زَيْدٌ رَكْضًا, meaning رَاكِضًا:<br>\
(IB:) excepting some of them, as Yoo, who<br>\
holds it to be in the acc. case as an adv. n. of<br>\
place, for عَلَى وَحْدِهِ, (IB, K,) like عِنْدَهُ: (TA:)<br>\
and there is a third opinion, that of Hishám;<br>\
that it is in the acc. case as an inf. n. (L.) Or,<br>\
(accord. to IAar, L,) it is a noun used as a<br>\
noun absolutely: (L, K:) so in the dial. of the<br>\
Benoo-Temeem: (Msb:) you say جَلَسَ وَحْدَهُ,<br>\
and عَلَى وَحْدِهِ, and جَلَسَا عَلَى وَحْدِ هِمَا, and<br>\
وَحْدَيْهِمَا, and جَلَسُوا عَلَى وَحْدِهِمْ, [He sat<br>\
alone, and they two sat alone, and they sat<br>\
alone]. (L, K.) When not preceded by a prefixed n. [or a prep.], it is always in the acc.<br>\
case: (Lth, L:) you say, لَا إِلَاَه إِلَّا اللّٰهُ وَحْدَهُ<br>\
[There is no deity but God alone]: and مَرَرْتُ<br>\
بِزَيْدٍ وَحْدَهُ [I passed by Zeyd alone]: (L:)<br>\
[excepting in a few cases, such as the phrases]<br>\
قُلْنَا هٰذَا الأَمْرَ وَحْدَيْنَا [We two alone said this<br>\
thing], and قَالَتَاهُ وَحْدَيْهُمَا [They two women<br>\
alone said it]; mentioned by AZ. (L.) You<br>\
say also, هٰذَا عَلَى وَحْدِهِ, and ↓ عَلَى حِدَتِهِ, This<br>\
is by itself; (L, K;) and هُمَا عَلَى حِدَتِهِمَا They<br>\
two are by themselves: and هُمْ عَلَى حِدَتِهِمْ<br>\
They are by themselves: (L:) and أَعْطِ كُلَّ وَاحِدٍ<br>\
مَنْهُمْ عَلَى حِدَتِهِ Give thou to every one of them<br>\
by himself; syn. على حِيَالِهِ. (S.) The ة in حِدَةٌ<br>\
is a substitute for the و (S, L) which is cut off<br>\
from the beginning. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  وَحْدٌ, (K,) or<br>\
↓ وَحَدٌ, (L,) A wild animal alone, by itself, or<br>\
apart from others. (L, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  وَحَدٌ, (K,) or<br>\
↓ وَحَدٌ, (L,) A man whose lineage and origin are<br>\
unknown. (Lth, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  وَحْد is used as the<br>\
complement of a prefixed n. only in the following phrases: (A&#39;Obeyd, S, L:) هُوَ نَسِيجُ وَحْدِهِ,<br>\
which is an expression of praise; (S, L, K;)<br>\
meaning, (tropical:)  He is one unequalled; one who has<br>\
no second: (L:) or he is a man of right judgment: you say also هُمَا نَسِيجَا وَحْدِهِمَا, and<br>\
هُمْ نُسَجَآءُ وَحْدِهِمْ, and هِىَ نَسِيجَةُ وَحْدِهَا, and<br>\
هُنَّ نَسَائِجُ وَحْدِهِنَّ: (Lth, L:) [see art. نسج:]<br>\
it is as though you said نَسِيجُ إِفْرَادٍ: you put<br>\
وحده in the place of an inf. n. in the gen. case:<br>\
(S:) and رَجُلُ وَحْدِهِ, (IAar, L,) and رُجَيْلُ وَحْدِهِ,<br>\
(S, L,) [A man unequalled; who has no second,<br>\
and a little man (probably meaning the contr.)<br>\
&amp;c.]: and قَرِيعُ وَحْدِهِ A man with whom no one<br>\
contends in excellence: (Lth, L:) and عُيَيْرُ وَحْدِهِ,<br>\
and جُحَيْشُ وَحْدِهِ, which are expressions of<br>\
dispraise; (S, L, K;) meaning, (tropical:)  One who does<br>\
not consult, nor mix with, any one, and who is<br>\
contemptible and weak: (Sh, L:) وَحْد being<br>\
used in the manner of an inf. n., not being an<br>\
epithet nor an enunciative so as to be in concordance with the preceding noun, would be<br>\
more properly in the acc. case; but the Arabs<br>\
use it in these instances as the complement of a<br>\
prefixed n.: (Lth, L:) these expressions are<br>\
indeterminate: for the Arabs say, رُبَّ نَسِيجِ وَحْدِهِ<br>\
قَدْ رَأَيْتُ (tropical:)  [Few unequalled men have I seen].<br>\
(Hishám, Fr., L.)<br>\
وَحَدٌ: see وَحْدٌ and وَحِيدٌ.<br>\
وَحِدٌ: see وَحِيدٌ.<br>\
وَحْدَةٌ The state of being alone, or apart from<br>\
others; solitariness; solitude. (Sb, S.) See 1.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  وَحْدَةُ القَبْرِ [The solitude of the grave]. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [لَيْلَةُ الوَحْدَةِ The night of solitude; the first<br>\
night after burial: so called because the soul is<br>\
believed to remain in the grave during this<br>\
night, and then to depart to the place appointed<br>\
for the residence of good souls until the last day,<br>\
or to the appointed prison in which wicked souls<br>\
await their final doom. See also لَيْلَةٌ الوَحْشَةِ.]<br>\
وَحْدَانِيَّةٌ The unity of God: (L, K: *) as<br>\
also أَحْدِيَّةٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
وَحْدَانِيٌّ One who is singular in his religious<br>\
opinions; who separates himself from the general<br>\
body of believers: a rel. n. from الوَحْدَةُ; the<br>\
ا and ن being added to give intensiveness to the<br>\
signification. (L.)<br>\
وُحَادَ: see مَوْحَدَ.<br>\
وَحِيدٌ (S, L, Msb, K) and ↓ مُتَوَحِّدٌ (L, K)<br>\
and ↓ وَحَدٌ and ↓ وَحِدٌ (S, L, Msb, K) and ↓ وَحْدٌ<br>\
(M, L) and ↓ وَاحِدٌ (L) A man alone; by himself; apart from others; solitary; lonely: (S,<br>\
M, L, Msb, K;) as also أَحَدٌ: (M, L, K:) or,<br>\
accord. to Az, one should not say رَجُلٌ أَحَدٌ,<br>\
nor دِرْهَمٌ أَحَدٌ, nor شَىْءٌ أَحَدٌ, though some of<br>\
the lexicologists assert that أَحَدٌ is originally<br>\
وَحَدٌ: for أَحَدٌ is an epithet applied to God<br>\
alone: (L:) the fem. epithet used in this sense is<br>\
وَحِدَةٌ: (K:) and ↓ وَاحِدٌ in this sense receives<br>\
the dual form: and the pl. is وُحْدَانٌ and أَحْدَانٌ<br>\
and وِحَادٌ. (L.) رَجُلٌ وَحِيدٌ A man who has<br>\
no one to cheer him by his society, conversation,<br>\
or company. And ↓ رَجُلٌ مُتَوَحِّدٌ A man who<br>\
remains alone, by himself, apart from others,<br>\
or solitary, not mixing with other people, not<br>\
sitting with them. (L.) See also وَحْدٌ.<br>\
وَاحِدٌ One; the first of the numbers: (S, L,<br>\
Msb, K:) syn. [in many cases, which will be<br>\
shown below,] with أَحَدٌ: (K:) [and one alone:<br>\
a single person or thing:] fem. وَاحِدَةٌ: (L,<br>\
Msb:) it sometimes receives the dual form;<br>\
(L, K;) as in the expression إِلْتَقَيْنَا وَاحِدَيْنِ<br>\
[We met, we being each of us one alone]; cited<br>\
from a poet by IAar: or the dual form pertains<br>\
to it in another sense, explained below, namely<br>\
“ alone: ” (L:) pl. وَاحِدُونَ (S, L, K) and<br>\
وُحْدَانٌ and أُحْدَانٌ; (S, L;) in the last of<br>\
which, أ is substituted for و because of the<br>\
dammeh: (L:) one says, أَنْتُمْ حَىٌّ وَاحِدٌ, and<br>\
حَىٌّ وَاحِدُونَ, (Ye are one tribe, L) like as one<br>\
says شِرْذِمَةٌ قَلِيلُونَ: (Fr, S, L:) آحَادٌ may also<br>\
be a pl. of وَاحِدٌ [and therefore originally أَوْحَادٌ,]<br>\
like as أَشْهَادٌ is pl. of شَاهِدٌ. (Th, Msb.) Its<br>\
proper signification is A thing having no subdivision: and it is secondarily applied to any<br>\
existing thing; so that there is no number to<br>\
which it may not be applied as an epithet;<br>\
wherefore one says, عَشَرَةٌ وَاحِدَةٌ [One ten], and<br>\
مِائَةٌ وَاحِدَةٌ [One hundred]. (Er-Rághib.) It<br>\
is interchangeable for أَحَدٌ when used as an<br>\
epithet applied to God; and in certain nouns<br>\
of number. [See art. أحد.] In most cases<br>\
differing from these two, there is a difference in<br>\
usage. The latter is used in affirmative phrases<br>\
as a prefixed noun only, governing the noun<br>\
which follows it in the gen. case; and is used<br>\
absolutely in negative phrases: whereas the<br>\
former is used in affirmative phrases as a prefixed<br>\
n. and otherwise. (Msb.) [See, again, art.<br>\
أَحد.] ―<br>\
-b2-  ↓ لَسْتُ فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ بأَوِْحَدَ I am not<br>\
alone, without a parallel, or watch, in this<br>\
affair: (S, * L, K: *) or simply, I am not alone<br>\
in it. (T, L.) The fem. وَحْدَآءُ is not used.<br>\
(S, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أُحْدَانٌ, the pl. of ↓ اوحد, is applied<br>\
by a poet to dogs having no equals or matches.<br>\
(S, L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  فُلَانٌ لَا وَاحِدَ لَهُ Such a one has no<br>\
equal, like, parallel, or match. (S, M, L.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
Also, One that has no equal; one unequalled.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b6-  فُلَانٌ وَاحِدُ دَهْرِهِ Such a person is the<br>\
unequalled one of his age. (S, L.) And in like<br>\
manner, (TA,) أَهْلِ زَمَانِهِ ↓ فُلَانٌ أَوْحَدُ (S, L)<br>\
Such a person is the unequalled one of the people<br>\
of his time. (TA.) The pl. of ↓ اوحد [as well<br>\
as of واحد in the same sense] is أُحْدَانٌ,<br>\
(originally وُحْدَانٌ, S) like as سُودَانٌ is pl. أَسْوَدُ.<br>\
(S, L.) ―<br>\
-b7-  وَاحِدُ أُمِّهِ [An unequalled son of his<br>\
mother], is an indeterminate expression, like<br>\
نَسِيجُ وَحْدِهِ, q. v. (Hishám, Fr. L.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Also,<br>\
A man pre-eminent in knowledge or science, or in<br>\
valour in war, (L, K [in the CK, for بَأْس is put<br>\
ناس]) or in other qualities; as though having<br>\
no equal, and thus being alone: (L:) pl.<br>\
وُحْدَانٌ and أُحْدانٌ. (L, K.) ―<br>\
-b9-  الوَاحِدُ and<br>\
الأَحَدُ (T, L) and ↓ الأَوْحَدُ and ↓ المُتَوَحِّدُ, (M,<br>\
L, K,) epithets applied to God, The One, the<br>\
Sole; He whose attribute is unity: (M, L, K:)<br>\
or the first signifies the One in essence, who has<br>\
no like nor equal; and the second, the One in<br>\
attributes, beside whom there is no other: or<br>\
the first, the One who is not susceptible of division<br>\
into parts or portions, nor of duplication, and<br>\
who has no equal nor like: (TL:) or the One<br>\
who has ever been alone, without companion:<br>\
(IAth, L:) and there is no being but God to<br>\
whom the first and second of these epithets are<br>\
applicable together, or to whom the second is<br>\
applicable alone. (T, L.) See also أَحَدٌ, in art.<br>\
أحد. ―<br>\
-b10-  الإِنْسَانُ وَالفَرَسُ وَاحِدٌ فِى الجِنْسِ The<br>\
human being and the horse are one in genus.<br>\
And زَيْد وَعَمرْوٌ وَاحِدٌ فِى النَّوْعِ Zeyd and &#39;Amr<br>\
are one in species. (Er-Rághib.) ―<br>\
-b11-  وَاحِدٌ Singular, as opposed to plural: pl. وُحْدَانٌ. (The<br>\
lexicons, passim.) ―<br>\
-b12-  أَصْحَابِى وَأَصْحَابُكَ وَاحِدٌ<br>\
[Thy companions and my companions are one<br>\
and the same]. And الجُلُوسُ وَالقُعُود وَاحِدٌ<br>\
[الجلوس and القعود are one and the same].<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b13-  See وَحِيدٌ. ―<br>\
-b14-  حَادِىَ عَشَرَ, masc., and<br>\
حَادِيَةَ عَشْرَةَ, fem., Eleventh. In this case, [and<br>\
in similar instances, as حَادِى وَعِشْرُونَ Twentyfirst, &amp;c.,] حادى and حادية are formed by transposition from وَاحِدٌ and وَاحِدَةٌ, by putting the<br>\
first radical letter after the second. [When<br>\
without the article, it is indecl.: but when rendered determinate by the article, the first word<br>\
is decl.] You say, هُوَ حَادِىَ عَشَرَهُمْ [He is the<br>\
eleventh of them]: and اليَوْمُ الحَادِى عَشَرَ [The<br>\
eleventh day]: and اللَّيْلَةُ الحَادِيَةُ عَشْرَةَ [The<br>\
eleventh night]. (ISd, L.) [The rules respecting حَادِىَ عَشَرَ and its fem. are the same as those<br>\
respecting ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ and its fem., explained in<br>\
art. ثلث, q. v.] ―<br>\
-b15-  بِوَاحِدَةٍ signifies i. q. فَقَطْ:<br>\
and is often used in the sense of البَتَّةَ. (MF,<br>\
voce ذُرُّوحٌ.)<br>\
إِحْدَى: see art. أحد.<br>\
أُحَادَ: see مُوْحَدَ.<br>\
أَوْحَدُ: see وَاحِدٌ.<br>\
مُوحِدٌ A ewe bringing forth, or that brings<br>\
forth, one ewe only. (S, K.) [See مُغْرِدٌ.]<br>\
مَوْحَدَ and ↓ وُحَادَ and أُحَادَ [used adverbially]<br>\
are imperfectly decl. because of their having the<br>\
quality of an epithet and deviating from their<br>\
original form, (S, L,) which is وَاحِدًا: (L, K:)<br>\
or because they differ from their original both as<br>\
to the letter and the meaning; the original word<br>\
being changed as above stated, and the meaning<br>\
being changed to وَاحِدًا وَاحِدًا: (S, L:) you say<br>\
دَخَلُوا مَوْحَدَ مَوْحَدَ, (S, L, K,) [and وُحَادَ وُحَادَ,]<br>\
and أُحَادَ أُحَادَ, (L, K,) They entered one [and]<br>\
one, [one and one]; or one [by] one, [one by<br>\
one]; (K;) or one at a time; one after another.<br>\
(S, L.)<br>\
[<br>\
مُوَحَّدَةٌ, (not مُوحَدَةٌ,) conv. term in lexicology, Having one diacritical point; one-pointed:<br>\
an epithet added to باء to prevent its being<br>\
mistaken for تاء, ثاء, or ياء. (The lexicons,<br>\
passim.)]<br>\
مِيحَادٌ One of several hills, such as are called<br>\
أَكَمَات, separate or remote, one from another:<br>\
pl. مَوَاحِيدُ. (L, K.) F remarks, that J is in<br>\
error in saying, المِيحَادُ مِنَ الوَاحِدِ كَالمِعْشَارِ مِنَ<br>\
العَشَرَةِ: (TA:) but the meaning of this is, that<br>\
it denotes one part or portion; like as مِعْشَارٌ<br>\
signifies one of ten: (L:) [i. e., the former signifies one of several things whereof each is<br>\
alone, or by itself:] and the same explanation<br>\
is given by [several] old authors. (TA.) [In<br>\
one copy of the S, instead of العَشَرَة, I find العُشْر;<br>\
which affords a good sense, i. e., that ميحاد, is<br>\
syn. with وَاحِدٌ; and may be the true reading.]<br>\
