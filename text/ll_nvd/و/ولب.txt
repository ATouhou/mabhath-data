وَلَبَ, aor. يَلِبُ, inf. n. وُلُوبٌ, He entered<br>\
(K) into a house or tent, or into a tract, or<br>\
quarter, or the like. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَلَبَ He hastened (K) in entering. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  وَلَبَ إِلَيْكَ الشَّىْءُ,<br>\
aor. يَلِبُ, inf. n. وُلُوبٌ, The thing, of whatever<br>\
kind it was, came to thee, or reached thee.<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, S.) In the copies of the K, وَلَبَ<br>\
الشَّىْءَ وإِلَيْكَ; accord. to which, the verb, in the<br>\
sense of وَصَلَ, there assigned to it, is trans.<br>\
both immediately and by means of إِلَى: but<br>\
the correct reading is ولب اليكالشىء, as above.<br>\
In an old, and generally correct, copy of the<br>\
Tahdheeb el-Af&#39;ál of IKtt, it is said that<br>\
ولب اليك الشَّرُّ signifies The evil reached thee:<br>\
syn. تَوَصَّلَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  وَلَبَ, inf. n. وُلُوبٌ and<br>\

increased. (IKtt.)<br>\
وَالِبٌ, Going into a thing; entering into it.<br>\
(Esh-Sheybánee, S.)<br>\
وَالِبَةٌ The offsets of the corn and the like:<br>\
(K:) so called because they enter into the roots<br>\
of the parent-plants: (TA:) or corn or the like<br>\
growing from the roots of that which has preceded it: (S:) pl. أَوَالِبُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَالِبَةٌ The<br>\
offspring of camels, (IAar, S,) and of sheep or<br>\
goats, (IAar, K,) and of cows, (K,) and of a<br>\
people. (IAar.)<br>\
تَوْلَبُ: see art. تلب. Accord. to Suh, the ت<br>\
is substituted for و, and the word is derived<br>\
from والية, the “ offsets of corn and the like: ”<br>\
and Ibn-&#39;Osfoor and IKtt assert the same.<br>\
