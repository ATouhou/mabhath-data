وَقَصَ عُنُقَهَ, (Ks, S, K,) and الشَّىْءَ, (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
TA,) aor. يَقِصُ, (Ks, S, K,) inf. n. وَقْصٌ, (Ks,<br>\
S, Mgh,) He broke his neck, (Ks, S, Mgh, K,)<br>\
and the thing. (A&#39;Obeyd, TA.) You say also,<br>\
وَقَصَتْ بِهِ رَاحِلَتُهُ [His riding-camel, or she-camel,<br>\
broke its neck]: (S, K:) like as you say, خُذِ<br>\
الخِطَامَ and خُذْ بِالخِطَام: (S:) and وَقَصَتِ<br>\
النَّاقَةُ بِرَاكِبِهَا The she-camel threw her rider and<br>\
broke his neck. (Msb.) And وُقِصَ He had his<br>\
neck broken; (S, K;) said of a man; (S:)<br>\
[and also] said of a camel, signifying, he became<br>\
diseased in his back, and without motion: and<br>\
in like manner said of the neck, and of the<br>\
back. (Khálid Ibn-Jembeh.) And وَقَصْتُ رَأْسَهُ I<br>\
pressed, or squeezed, his head; sometimes meaning, so as to break the neck. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
وَقَصَ الدَّيْنُ عُنُقَهُ (tropical:)  Debt [oppressed him as though<br>\
it] broke his neck. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] الفَرَسُ<br>\
يَقِصُ الإِكَامَ (tropical:)  The horse bruises the hills, or rising<br>\
grounds: (S, K:) or breaks the summits thereof:<br>\
(A:) and in like manner one says of a she-camel.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  You say also, الدَّابَّةُ تَذُبُّ بِذَنَبِهَا فَتَقِصُ<br>\
عَنْهَا الذُّبَابَ (tropical:)  The beast of carriage beats off<br>\
from her with her tail, and kills, the flies. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  وَقَصَتِ العُنُقُ The neck broke: thus the verb<br>\
is intrans. as well as trans.: (K:) or, accord.<br>\
to Ks, one does not say this: (S:) i. e., one<br>\
only says of the neck وُقِصَت, using the pass.<br>\
form. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  وَقِصَ, (S, K,) aor. يَوْقَصُ, (S,)<br>\
inf. n. وَقَصٌ, (S, A, Mgh, K,) He (a man, S)<br>\
was short in the neck. (S, A, Mgh, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
وقّص عَلَى نَارِهِ, (S, A,) inf. n. تَوْقِيصٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He threw fragments, or broken pieces, of sticks<br>\
upon his fire: (S, * A:) or he broke in pieces<br>\
sticks upon his fire. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اوقصهُ He (God) made him to be short in<br>\
the neck. (S, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
توقّص (tropical:)  He went a pace between that called<br>\
العَنَق and that called الخَبَب; (K;) falling short<br>\
of the latter, but exceeding the former, and removing his legs as in the pace called الخبب,<br>\
excepting that they were nearer to the ground,<br>\
and throwing himself [forward]: (AO:) or he<br>\
trod vehemently in going, (K, TA,) with short<br>\
steps, (TA,) as though breaking what was beneath<br>\
him: (K, TA:) or he (a horse) bounded (As,<br>\
S, A) in his running, (As,) making short steps,<br>\
(As, S, A,) as though breaking his steps. (A.)<br>\
You say, مَرَّ فُلَانٌ يَتَوَقَّصُ بِهِ فَرَسُهُ Such a one<br>\
passed along, his horse bounding, and making<br>\
short steps, with him. (S.)<br>\
6<br>\
تواقص He made himself like, or imitated,<br>\
him who is short in the neck: (K:) said of a<br>\
man. (TA.) Hence, تَوَاقَصَ عَلَى بُرْدَتِهِ كَىْ لَا<br>\
تَسْقط He bent and shortened himself to hold on<br>\
his بُرْدَة with his neck, that it might not fall.<br>\
(TA, from a trad.)<br>\
وَقْصٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
وَقَصٌ (tropical:)  Fragments, or broken pieces, of sticks,<br>\
which are thrown upon, (S,) or into, (K,) a fire:<br>\
(S, K:) or small pieces of fire-wood with which<br>\
a fire is made to burn more vehemently; (A,<br>\
TA;) as also وَقَشٌ: so, says Aboo-Turáb, I<br>\
heard Mubtekir say. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, sing. of<br>\
أَوْقَاصٌ, as used in relation to the [tax called<br>\
صَدَقَة; signifying (tropical:)  What is between one فِرِيضَة<br>\
and the next فَرِيضَة: (S, K:) as, for instance,<br>\
when camels amount in number to five, one sheep<br>\
or goat is to be given for them; and nothing is<br>\
to be given for such as exceed that number until<br>\
they amount to ten: thus, what is between the<br>\
five and the ten is termed وَقَصٌ: (S:) sometimes pronounced ↓ وَقْصٌ: (Msb:) and in like<br>\
manner, شَنَقٌ: (S:) or (accord. to some of the<br>\
learned, S) وقص relates to bulls and cows particularly, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or to these and to<br>\
sheep and goats, (Msb,) and شنق [q. v.] to camels:<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb:) both signifying what is between<br>\
one فريضة and the next: (S, Mgh, Msb: *) or,<br>\
accord. to Aboo-&#39;Amr, (Mgh, L,) i. e. Esh-Sheybánee, (L,) وَقَصٌ signifies camels for which<br>\
it is incumbent to give sheep or goats in payment<br>\
of the صَدَقَة, (Mgh, L,) when the camels are<br>\
between five and twenty in number; (L;) but<br>\
some disapprove of this: (Mgh, L:) accord. to<br>\
IB, it signifies sheep or goats taken in payment<br>\
of the صَدَقَة for camels. (L.)<br>\
-A3-  You also say,<br>\
صَارُوا أَوْقَاصًا (assumed tropical:)  They became scattered, or dispersed: and أَتَانَا أَوْقَاصٌ مِنْ بَنِى فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  There<br>\
came to us separate portions of the tribe of the<br>\
sons of such a one: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K: *) اوقاص<br>\
in these cases being a pl., [namely of وَقَصٌ,] like<br>\
أَسْبَابٌ, pl. of سَبَبٌ. (TA.)<br>\
وَقِيصَةٌ: see مَوْقُوصٌ.<br>\
وَاقِصَةٌ: see مَوْقُوصٌ.<br>\
أَوْقَصُ A man (S, Mgh) short in the neck; (S,<br>\
A, Mgh, K;) naturally so: (TA:) or having<br>\
the neck inclining and short: (A&#39;Obeyd, TA:)<br>\
fem. وَقْصَآءُ. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  خُدْ أَوْقَصَ الطَّرِيقَيْنِ<br>\
(tropical:)  Take thou the nearer of the two ways: (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, K: *) or shorter thereof. (A, TA.)<br>\
مَوْقُوصٌ A man (S) having his neck broken:<br>\
(S, K:) and so مَوْقُوصُ العُنُقِ: (A:) the fem. is<br>\
with ة: and ↓ وَاقِصَةٌ occurs in the sense of مَوْقُوصَةٌ<br>\
in a trad. of &#39;Alee, in which he is said to have<br>\
given judgment in the case of the قَارِصَة and the<br>\
قَامِصَة and the ↓ وَاقِصَة, that the price of blood,<br>\
or fine for homicide, should be paid in thirds;<br>\
these being three girls, who were playing together, and mounted, one upon another; and<br>\
the lowest pinched the middle one, who thereupon leaped off, so that the uppermost fell, and<br>\
her neck broke; wherefore he imposed a third<br>\
of the fine for the killing of the uppermost upon<br>\
the lowest, and the like upon the middle one,<br>\
annulling the third of the uppermost because she<br>\
aided against herself: (Mgh, TA, in art. قرص,<br>\
and Msb,) here, [accord. to those who hold that<br>\
وَقَصَ is trans. only,] ↓ واقصة is like رَاضِيَةٌ, in<br>\
the phrase عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ; (TA, in art. قرص and in<br>\
the present art.;) and is used in the place of<br>\
موقوصة for the sake of agreement in form with<br>\
the two other epithets: (Mgh, in art. قرص, and<br>\
Msb:) ↓ وَقِيصَةٌ, also, signifies having her neck<br>\
broken; and its pl. is وَقَائِصُ. (Meyd, as in<br>\
Freytag&#39;s Lex., excepting that the pl. is there<br>\
written وَقَايِصُ.) You say also عُنُقٌ مَوْقُوصَةٌ A<br>\
broken neck. (Msb.) And مَوْقُوصٌ is also applied<br>\
to a camel, signifying, Become diseased in his<br>\
back, and without motion. (Khálid Ibn-Jembeh.)<br>\
