وَعَدَ, aor. يَعِدُ, inf. n. وَعْدٌ and عِدَةٌ, (S, L,<br>\
Msb, K,) [in which the ة is a substitute for the<br>\
elided و,] or the latter is a quasi-inf. n., (L,)<br>\
and مَوْعِدٌ and مَوْعِدَةٌ, (L, Msb, K,) or the last<br>\
is a quasi-inf. n., (L,) and مَوْعُودٌ and مَوْعُودَةٌ,<br>\
(L, K,) the last two being instances of inf. ns.<br>\
of the measures مَفْعُولٌ and مَفْعوُلَةٌ, (L,) He<br>\
promised. (TA.) It is trans. immediately, and<br>\
by means of the prep. ب; (L, Msb, K;) but<br>\
some say that the ب is redundant in this case;<br>\
and most of the lexicologists disallow it with<br>\
this form of the verb, allowing it only with أَوْعَدَ.<br>\
(TA.) It is also used with reference to good<br>\
and evil: (S, L, Msb, K:) you say وَعَدَهُ خَيْرًا<br>\
[He promised him good]: and وَعَدَهُ شَرًّا (tropical:)  [He<br>\
threatened him with evil]: (Fr, Fs, S, L, Msb,<br>\
K, &amp;c.:) and, [accord. to some,] وعده بِخَيْرٍ,<br>\
and بِشَرّ. (IKoot, Msb.) When neither good<br>\
nor evil is mentioned, if you mean the former,<br>\
you say وَعَدَ [He promised good]: and if you<br>\
mean the latter, ↓ أَوْعَدَ, (Fr, T, S, L, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. إِيعَادٌ, with which وَعِيدٌ is syn., (S, L,<br>\
Msb, K,) being one irregular inf. n., [or quasiinf. n.,] (Msb,) [He threatened,] or threatened<br>\
with, evil]; and ↓ أَوْعَدَهُ [He threatened him,<br>\
menaced him, or threatened him with evil];<br>\
(Msb;) as also ↓ توعّدهُ, (L, Msb,) inf. n. تَوَعُّدٌ;<br>\
(S, L, K;) and ↓ اتّعدهُ. (L.) You also say<br>\
خَيْرًا ↓ اوعد [He promised good]; (IAar, T,<br>\
ISd, Msb, K;) but this is extr.: (L:) and<br>\
بِشَرٍّ ↓ اوعد [He threatened, or threatened with,<br>\
evil]: (S, L, Msb, K:) when ب is introduced<br>\
after this form of the verb, it relates only to<br>\
evil: (Fs, Msb:) but you also say شَرًّا ↓ اوعده.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Failure of performance, with respect<br>\
to a promise, the Arabs regard as a lie; but<br>\
with regard to a threat, as generosity. A poet<br>\
says,<br>\
وَإِنِّى وَإِنْ أَوْعَدْتُهُ أَوْ وَعَدْتُهُ<br>\
لَمُخْلِفُ إِيعَادِى وَمُنْجِزُ مَوْعِدِى<br>\
[And verily I, if I threaten him or promise him,<br>\
fail to perform my threat, but fulfil my promise].<br>\
(Msb.) Nay, they do not apply the term خُلْفٌ<br>\
to the failure of performing a threat. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
يَوْمُنَا يَعِدُ بَرْدًا (tropical:)  Our day promises cold. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
وَعَدَتِ الأَرض (tropical:)  The land promised good produce.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  وَاعَدَهُ فَوَعَدَهُ: see 3.<br>\
3<br>\
واعدهُ, inf. n. مُوَاعَدَةٌ, He promised him,<br>\
the latter doing the same to him. (Aboo-Mo&#39;ádh, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَاعَدَهُ فَوَعَدَهُ He vied with him<br>\
in promising, and surpassed him therein, by promising more. (L, K. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  وَاعَدهُ الوقْتَ, and<br>\
المَوْضِعَ, [He appointed with him the time, and<br>\
the place]. (L, K.) أَوْعَدَنِى مَوْعِدًا is a vulgar<br>\
mistake. (Aboo-Bekr, L.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَوْعَدَ see 1 throughout.<br>\
-A2-  اوعد, (A, L,) inf. n.<br>\
إِيعَادٌ, (L,) in the sense of which وَعِيدٌ is also<br>\
used [as a quasi-inf. n.], (S, A, L, K) (tropical:)  He (a<br>\
stallion-camel) brayed, (هَدَرَ, S, A, &amp;c.) on his<br>\
being about to attack and fight with other camels.<br>\
(S, A, L.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَوَعَّدَ see 1.<br>\
6<br>\
تواعدوا and ↓ اتّعدوا signify the same,<br>\
[They promised one another]: (K *, TA:) or<br>\
the former relates to good, (S, Msb, K,) signifying they promised one another something good:<br>\
(S, Msb,) and the latter, to evil, (S, L, K,) signifying they threatened one another: (L:) and<br>\
this distinction is commonly admitted and observed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تَواَعَدْنَا المَوْضِعَ, [and الوَقْتَ,<br>\
We appointed mutually the place, and the time].<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
8<br>\
اتّعد, (A,) [aor. يَتَّعِدُ,] inf. n. إِتِّعَادٌ, (S, L,<br>\
K,) He accepted a promise: (S, A, L, K:)<br>\
originally إِوْتَعَدَ; the و being changed into ت<br>\
and then incorporated [into the augmentative<br>\
ت]: some persons say ائْتَعَدَ, aor. يَأْتَعِدُ, (inf. n.<br>\
ائْتِعَادٌ, TA) and pronounce the act. part. n.<br>\
مُؤْتَعِدٌ, with ء; (S, L, K;) like as they say<br>\
يَأْتَسِرُ: (S, L:) but [if they do not change the و<br>\
into ت] they should say إِيتَعَدَ, and يَاتَعِدُ, and<br>\
مُوتَعِدٌ, without<br>\
وَعُدَ. (IB, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, He confided in the promise of another. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See<br>\
also 1: ―<br>\
-b4-  and 6.<br>\
وَعْدٌ and ↓ عِدَةٌ (in which latter the ة is a<br>\
substitute for the [elided] و, S, L) and ↓ مَوْعِدٌ<br>\
and ↓ مَوْعِدَةٌ and ↓ مَوْعُودٌ (A) and ↓ مَوْعُودَةٌ:<br>\
(L:) see 1: A promising; a promise; (A, L;)<br>\
meaning, of something good: (S, L, &amp;c.:) pl.<br>\
of the first, وُعُودٌ; (IJ, L;) or this has no pl.:<br>\
(T, S, L, Msb:) and of the second, عِدَاتٌ: (T,<br>\
S, L, Msb:) (and of the ↓ third, مَوَاعِدُ:] and<br>\
of ↓ موعود, مَوَاعِيدُ. (L.) When عِدَة is used<br>\
as a prefixed n., [in a case of wasl,] the ة is<br>\
elided, (Fr, S, L,) and ى is substituted for it:<br>\
(Fr, L:) a poet says,<br>\
وَأَخْلَفُوكَ عِدَى الْأَمْرِ الَّذِى وَعَدُوا<br>\
[And they have broken to thee the promise of the<br>\
thing which they promised]. (Fr, S, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
عَطِيَّةٌ ↓ العِدَةُ [A promise is equivalent to a gift]:<br>\
i. e., it is base to break it as it is to take back a<br>\
gift. A proverb. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  الثريَّا ↓ وَعَدَهُ عِدَةَ<br>\
بِالقَمَرِ [He promised him as the moon promises<br>\
the Pleiades]: for the moon and the Pleiades<br>\
are in conjunction once in every month. Another<br>\
proverb. (TA.) [Perhaps we may also read<br>\
عِدَّةَ الثُّزَيَّا القَمَرَ: see مدَاد, in art. عد.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
إِخْلَافُ الوَعْدِ مِنْ أَخْلَاقِ الوَغْدِ [The breaking of<br>\
a promise is one of the natural habits of the<br>\
mean and base]. A saying of the Arabs. (MF.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  وَعْدٌ also signifies The fulfilment of a promise. Ex. مَتَى هٰذَا الوَعْدُ, in the Kur, [x. 49, &amp;c.]<br>\
means, When shall be the fulfilment of this promise? (L.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also, a thing promised. (TK,<br>\

عِدِىٌّ Of, or relating or belonging to, a promise: rel. n. of عِدَةٌ, like زِنِىٌّ of زِنَةٌ, formed<br>\
without restoring the و like as it is restored in<br>\
[the rel. n. of] شِيَةٌ: [see art. شيو:] but Fr says<br>\
عِدَوِىٌّ and زِنَوِىٌّ, like شِيَوِىٌّ. (S, L.)<br>\

أَرْضٌ وَاعِدَةٌ (tropical:)  Land of which the herbage is hoped<br>\
to prove good and productive, (As, S, A, L, K,)<br>\

accord. to Mujáhid, in ch. xx. vv. 89 and 90,<br>\
of the Kur-án. (L.) ―<br>\

the inf. ns. which have pls. governing as verbs;<br>\
