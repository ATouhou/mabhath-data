وَدَأَهُ, aor. يَدَأُ, He made it even or plain.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
-A2-  See 5.<br>\
-A3-  ودأ (aor. يَدَأُ, T) Veretrum<br>\
exseruit equus: (T, K:) but AHeyth says that<br>\
this is an error, and that the correct word is<br>\
without ء: [i. e., وَدَى, q.v.]. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  دَأْنِى<br>\
[imp.], i. q. دَعْنِى, Let me &amp;c. (K.) Said by<br>\
some to be of weak authority. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
ودّأ عليه الأَرْضَ, inf. n. تَوْدِىْءٌ, He made<br>\
the earth even, or plain, over him. (AZ, S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  وَدَّأَتْهُ الأَرْضُ The earth, or the land, hid, or<br>\
concealed, him. (TA.) [See also 5.] ―<br>\
-b3-  ودّأ,<br>\
He, or it, buried. (IAar.) ―<br>\
-b4-  ودّأ بِهِمْ, inf. n.<br>\
تَوْدِئَةٌ; (S, L;) accord. to the K, وَدَأَ; but this<br>\
is incorrect; (TA;) He covered, or overwhelmed,<br>\
them with evil, or with ill treatment. (L, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تودّاتُ عَلَيْهِ الأَرْضُ The earth became even,<br>\
or plain, over him, (K,) as over a dead body in<br>\
the grave: (TA:) or enclosed him: or was<br>\
overturned over him: or was broken in pieces<br>\
over him. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The earth, or the land, hid,<br>\
or concealed, him. (TA.) [See also 2.] This<br>\
phrase is used when a person has gone away to<br>\
the more distant parts of the earth, or land,<br>\
so that it is not known what he has done: also,<br>\
when a man has died; even if among his family.<br>\
(ISh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  تودّأت عَنْهُ الأَخْبَارُ News, or tidings,<br>\
of him were cut off, or ceased to come; like<br>\
↓ وَدِئَتْ, and were hid. (K.) [In the K we<br>\
read, عنه الاخبارُ انقطعت [تودّأت] عليه و [تودّأت] و<br>\
الخ: whence it seems that تودّأت عليه الاخبار<br>\
also has the above signification. But in the<br>\
TA, after عليه, in the passage above quoted from<br>\
the K, is inserted الارض. This word, however,<br>\
has, I think, been inserted through inadvertence:<br>\
if not, تودّأت عليه الارضُ signifies The land was<br>\
interrupted to him, and hid: as also ↓ وَدِئَت.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  تودّأ عَلَى مَالِهِ He took his property or wealth,<br>\
and kept it carefully. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  تودّأ عَلَيْهِ He,<br>\
or it, destroyed him. (S, K.)<br>\
وَدَأٌ Perdition; destruction. (K.)<br>\
مُوَدَّأٌ [Earth made even, or plain, over a person: or earth hiding, or concealing, him;] like<br>\
مُحْصَنٌ for مُحْصِنٌ, &amp;c. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A grave.<br>\
(See below.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Zuheyr Ibn-Mes-ood Ed-Dabbee<br>\
says, in an elegy on his brother Ubeí,<br>\
أَ أُبَىُّ إِنْ تُصْبِحْ رَهِينَ مُوَدَّأٍ<br>\
زَلْجِ الجَوَانِبِ قَعْرُهُ مَلْحُودُ<br>\
[O Ubeí ! if thou become a deposit in a place<br>\
over which the earth is made even, or plain, (or<br>\
in a place that hideth thee, or in a grave,)<br>\
with smooth, or slippery, sides, and having its<br>\
bottom hollowed out laterally, ―<br>\
-b4- ] (S, TA. See<br>\
Ham, p. 466.) ―<br>\
-b5-  مُوَدَّأَةٌ A place of destruction,<br>\
or perdition; or a desert in which is no water.<br>\
(AA, S, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also, accord. to IAar, or without ة, as in an example which he quotes, A<br>\
grave. (TA.)<br>\
