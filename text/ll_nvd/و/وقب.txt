وَقَبَ الظَّلَامُ The darkness came in upon the<br>\
people. (S, K *.) ―<br>\
-b2-  So in the verse of the<br>\
Kur. [cxiii. 3,] وَمِنْ شَرِّ غَاسِقٍ إِذَا وَقَبَ And from<br>\
the mischief of night when it cometh in upon<br>\
men; (S;) [for other explanations see غَاسِقٌ in art.<br>\
غسق.] ―<br>\

only the latter of the two inf. ns., which is<br>\
explained as signifying “ the sounding of a<br>\
horse&#39;s prepuce: ”] or made a sound by the<br>\
motion of his penis in its prepuce. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
وَقَبَ, aor. يَقِبُ, inf. n. وَقْبٌ It (a thing) entered:<br>\
(S:) but it is said in a marginal note in a copy<br>\
of the S, that the inf. n. is correctly وُقُوبٌ, because<br>\
the verb is intrans.: accord. to some, it signifies<br>\
he, or it, entered into a وَقْبٌ, q. v.; and in the<br>\
K, وَقْبٌ is given as the inf. n. of the verb in<br>\
this sense. (TA.) [In the CK, وَقْت is put by<br>\
mistake for وَقْب.] ―<br>\

(Fr, S, K:) or, as in some Lexicons, into a وَقْب.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
وَقْبٌ A small hollow, or cavity, (نُقْرَةٌ,) in which<br>\
water collects, in a mountain: (S:) or in a rock:<br>\
as also ↓ وَقْبَةٌ: (K:) or, accord. to some, وقب is<br>\
a coll. gen. n., of which وقبة is the n. un.:<br>\
(MF:) pl. أَوْقَابٌ: (TA:) or وَقْبٌ, accord. to<br>\
the K, (but accord. to the TA ↓ وَقْبَةٌ,) signifies<br>\

وَغْبٌ: (S:) an epithet of a man: pl. أَوْقَابٌ: (K,<br>\

-b2-  So in the following trad. of El-Ahnaf: إِيَّاكُمْ وَحَمِيَّةَ الأَوْقَابِ<br>\
[Beware of the care with which stupid people<br>\
defend their rights: a proverb]. (TA.) For<br>\
الاوقاب, another relation substitutes الأَوغْاب,<br>\

أَوْقَابٌ ―<br>\

―<br>\
-b3-  وَقْبَةُ الثَّرِيدِ, (S, K,) and الدُّهْنِ, (K,) but<br>\
the latter is a mistake, and the correct word is<br>\
المُدْهُنِ, [a vase for ointment], (TA,) i. q. أَنْقُوعَتُهُ,<br>\
[i. e., its cavity or hollow]. (S, K.) Lth says,<br>\
that ↓ وَقْبٌ signifies any cavity, hollow, or pit;<br>\
as that in a [stone of the kind called] فِهْرٌ, and<br>\
in a مُدْهُن, or مُدْهُنَة, q. v. (TA.)<br>\

-b2-<br>\
مِيقَابٌ A stupid, or foolish, woman: or one<br>\
who gives birth to stupid, or foolish, children;<br>\
syn. مُحْمِقَةٌ. (K: [so in the CK: in a MS.<br>\
copy, مُحَمَّقَةٌ, one to whom stupidity, or folly,<br>\
is imputed: but the former is evidently the<br>\
right reading; ميقاب being an epithet similar to<br>\
مِذْكَارٌ and مِئْنَاثٌ &amp;c.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Latam vulvam<br>\
habens mulier. (K.) ―<br>\
