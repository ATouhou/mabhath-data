وَهَبَ لَهُ شَيْئًا, (aor. يَهَبُ, K; said to be<br>\
originally يَوْهِبُ; which is changed into يَهِبُ<br>\
because of the kesr; and then, into يَهَبُ because<br>\
of the medial guttural letter; Msb, voce وَسِعَ;)<br>\
inf. n. وَهْبٌ and وَهَبٌ and هِبَةٌ (S, K) and مَوْهِبٌ<br>\
and مَوْهِبَةٌ, (Msb,) or the last two are substs.,<br>\
(S, K, &amp;c.) He gave him a thing; properly, as<br>\
a free gift, disinterestedly, and not for any<br>\
compensation. (Msb, TA.) You should not<br>\
say وَهَبَكَهُ [he gave it to thee], (K, &amp;c.,) making<br>\
the verb doubly trans.: (TA:) or [this is<br>\
allowable, as it is said that] AA has related this<br>\
on the authority of an Arab of the desert: so in<br>\
the K: but in the L, it is said that Seer has<br>\
related this, from &#39;Amr, (meaning Sb,) from an<br>\
Arab of the desert. (TA.) En-Nawawee allows<br>\
the expression وَهَبُتُ كَذَا مِنْهُ, meaning, I gave<br>\
such a thing to him, &amp;c.; (من being redundant,<br>\
as in بِعْتُ كَذَا مِنْهُ “ I sold such a thing to<br>\
him; ”) as occurring in several trads. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See 3. ―<br>\
-b3-  وَهَبَنِىاللّٰهُ فِدَاكَ May God make me<br>\
[or give me as] thy ransom! (IAar, K.)<br>\
وُهِبْتُ فِدَاكَ May I be made [or given as] thy<br>\
ransom! Ibn-Umm-Kásim says, that وهب is<br>\
one of the verbs which signify He caused to be,<br>\
or to become: and he cites the above phrase<br>\
from IAar; and adds, that the verb is only used<br>\
in the pret. tense. Others assert it to be rare.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  هَبْنِى فَعَلْتُ ذٰلِكَ Suppose me; syn.<br>\
ظُنَّنِى; (AHei, cited by Fei;) or count me, or<br>\
reckon me; syn. أُحْسُبْنِى وَاعْدُدْنِى; (M, K;)<br>\
[or grant me;] to have done that. (M, K. *)<br>\
هَبْ زَيْدًا مَنْطَلِقًا Suppose Zeyd to be going away,<br>\
or gone away; syn. إِحْسَبْ. (So in two copies<br>\
of the S: in another, أُحْسُبْ.) Thus this verb is<br>\
doubly trans.: (S:) but it is not used in this<br>\
sense in the pret., nor in the aor.: (S, K:) you<br>\
do not say وَهَبْتُكَ فَعَلْتَ ذٰلِكَ [I supposed thee to<br>\
have done that]: nor (as some assert, Msb,) do<br>\
you say هَبْ أَنِّى فَعَلْتُ, (TA,) as say the vulgar,<br>\
though what the grammarians say, respecting<br>\
the class of verbs to which ظَنَنْتُ belongs, that<br>\
أَنَّ and إِنَّ [with what follows them] may supply<br>\
the place of the two objective complements, [as<br>\
when you say ظَنَنْتُ أَنَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ, and ظننت إِنَّ<br>\
زَيْدًا لَقَائِمٌ, “I thought Zeyd to be standing,”]<br>\
affords matter for controverting this. (Msb.)<br>\

وَاْهَبَ ↓ وَاهَبَهُ فَوَهَبَهُ, aor. of the latter verb يَهَبُ<br>\
and يَهِبُ, He strove to surpass him in giving,<br>\
freely, or disinterestedly, and he surpassed him<br>\
therein. (K.) [The former of the above aors.,<br>\
accord. to general opinion, is irregular; and the<br>\
latter, regular; because the first radical letter is<br>\
و; as in the case of وَاعَدَهُ فَوَعَدَهُ, aor. يَعِدُ:<br>\
or, accord. to the rule laid down by Ks, the<br>\
reverse is perhaps the case, because the medial<br>\
radical letter is a guttural. See Lumsden&#39;s Ar.<br>\
Gram., p. 171.]<br>\
4<br>\
اوهب لَهُ الشَّىْءَ He prepared, or made<br>\
ready, the thing for him. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَوْهَبْتُكَ الطَّعَامَ<br>\
وَالشَّرَابَ I prepared, or made ready, for thee the<br>\
food and beverage, and abundance of them.<br>\
(Tahdheeb el-Af&#39;ál.) But see this verb in an<br>\
intrans. sense. ―<br>\
-b3-  أَوْهَبَ الطَّعَامُ (tropical:)  The food, or<br>\
corn, or the like, became abundant and ample, so<br>\
that some of it was given away. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  أَوْهَبْتُ<br>\
لِأَمْرِ كَذَا (tropical:)  I became capable of such a thing<br>\
and able to do it. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَوْهَبَ لَكَ الشَّىْءُ The<br>\
thing was, or became, within thy power, or reach,<br>\
so that thou mightest take it. (K. *) Related on<br>\
the authority of IAar alone, who says, They<br>\
did not say أَوْهَبْتُهُ لَكَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَوْهَبَ لَهُ الشَّىْءُ<br>\
The thing was lasting to him. (A&#39;Obeyd, AZ,<br>\
S, K.) J cites the following verse:<br>\
عَظِيمُ القَفَا رِخْوُ الخَوَاصِرِ أَوْهَبَتْ<br>\
لَهُ عَجْوَةٌ مَسْمُونَةٌ وَخَمِيرُ<br>\
[Large in the back of the neck, soft (or loose or<br>\
flabby) in the flanks: dates of the best that ElMedeeneh produces, prepared with clarified butter,<br>\
and leaven, are lasting (provisions) to him].<br>\
But &#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh says, that this is a mistake, and that the right reading is أُرْهِنَتْ,<br>\
meaning “ are prepared, and continued. ” So in<br>\
a marginal note in a copy of the S. (TA.) [So<br>\
too in the margin of one of my MS. copies<br>\
of the S.]<br>\
6<br>\
تواهبوا They gave gifts, one to another.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  فِيهِمِ التَّوَاهُبُ [They have a habit<br>\
of mutually giving gifts]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  تَوَاهَبَهُ<br>\
النَّاسُ بَيْنَهُمْ [The people gave it; one to another].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  وَلَا التَّوَاهُبُ فِيمَا بَيْنَهُمْ صعةٌ [Nor is<br>\
their mutual giving of what is (possessed) among<br>\
them (from fear of) humiliation]: i. e., they<br>\
do not give by constraint. (TA, from a trad.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِتهَبَ (originally إِوْتَهَبَ, TA,) He accepted<br>\
a هِبَة, or gift. (S, Msb.) اتّهبه He accepted it<br>\
[as a gift]. (K.) إِتَّهَبْتُ مِنْكَ دِرْهَمًا [I accepted<br>\
from thee a dirhem, as a gift]. (L.)<br>\
10<br>\
استوهب, (S,) or استوهب هِبةَ, (Msb,) He<br>\
asked for a هبة, or gift. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  استوهبهُ<br>\
خَادِمًا [He asked him to give him a servant.]<br>\
(K, art. خدم.)<br>\
هَِبةٌ and ↓ مَوْهَبَةٌ A gift (or thing bestowed);<br>\
properly, one that is freely and disinterestedly<br>\
given, not for any compensation; a free, or<br>\
disinterested, gift. (L.) [In the K, the latter<br>\
is explained as signifying simply a gift.] Pl. of<br>\
the former هِبَاةٌ; and of the latter, مَوَاهِبُ. (A,<br>\
&amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [A هِبَاةٌ is of two kinds: مَوَاهِبُ A<br>\
free gift, for no requital, or compensation:<br>\
and هِبَةُ ثَوَابٍ A gift for a requital, or compensation. This distinction is made in law, &amp;c.]<br>\
هُبَةٌ i. q. أُهْبَةٌ q. v. (K, in art. اهب.)<br>\

وَاهِبٌ and ↓ وَهُوبٌ (K) and ↓ وَهَّابٌ and ↓ وَهَّابَةٌ<br>\
(S, K) epithets from وَهَبَ, [“ he gave, &amp;c. ”: the<br>\
first signifies Giving; properly, as a free gift,<br>\
disinterestedly; and not for any compensation:<br>\
or one who gives; &amp;c.:] the others are intensive<br>\
epithets, [as is said in the S of the third and<br>\
fourth,] signifying one who gives liberally, or<br>\
bountifully; &amp;c.: and in this sense ↓ الوَهَّابُ is<br>\
used as an epithet of God; or, accord. to the<br>\
Nh, it signifies He who dispenses his bounties<br>\
universally and perpetually, freely, or without<br>\
constraint, and disinterestedly, for no compensation. The ة in ↓ وهّابة is added to give more<br>\
force to the intensiveness; as in عَلَّامَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
مَوْهِب and ↓ مَوْهِبَةٌ substs. of وَهَبَ [“ he gave,<br>\
&amp;c.; ” signifying A gift (or act of giving);<br>\
properly, that is free and disinterested, not for<br>\
any compensation; a free, or disinterested, donation]. (S, K, &amp;c.) See 1.<br>\

-A2-  أَصْبَحَ فُلَانٌ مُوهِبًا Such a<br>\
one became prepared, or ready, (مُعَدًّا; so in<br>\

مُعِدًّا:) and able. (S.)<br>\
مَوْهَبَةٌ: see هِبَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  A cloud falling [in rain]<br>\
in any place: (K:) pl. مَوَاهِبُ: you say كَثُرَتِ<br>\

in the land. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  مَوْهَبَةٌ and ↓ مَوْهِبَةٌ (tropical:)  A<br>\
small pool of water left by a torrent: or the<br>\
former only is the correct word, and the meaning<br>\
of which, as explained in the S, is a small hollow,<br>\
or cavity, in a mountain, in which water stagnates: pl. مَوَاهِبُ: and in the T it is said that<br>\
a small cavity, or hollow, in a rock, is called<br>\
مَوْهَبَةٌ, with fet-h, being extr. [with respect to<br>\
rule]. (TA.)<br>\
