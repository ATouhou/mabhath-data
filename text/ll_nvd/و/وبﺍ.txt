وَبِئَتِ الأَرْضُ, (S, K,) aor. تِيبَأُ, (K, TA,)<br>\
or تَيْبَأُ, (CK,) and تَوْبَأُ, (accord. to the K: in<br>\
the (S and) L and other lexicons, only this last aor.<br>\
is mentioned; but it is asserted on the authority<br>\
of AZ, who says that this form of the pret. is of the<br>\
dial. of the Kusheyrees, that the aor. is تِيبَا, with<br>\
kesr to the ت, [contr. to analogy,] TA,) inf. n. وَبَأٌ;<br>\
(K;) or وَبَآءَةٌ; (S;) and وَبِيَت, aor. تَيْبَا and تَوْبَا;<br>\
(Moo&#39;ab and Jámi&#39;) and وَبُؤَت, inf. n. وَبَآءٌ and<br>\
وَبَآءَةٌ and أَبَآ and أَبَآةٌ (K, the و being changed<br>\
into أ in the latter two); and with و without<br>\
وَبُاَ,<br>\
[i. e., وَبُوَت]; (Moo&#39;ab and Jámi&#39;] and وُبِئَت,<br>\
(S, K,) like عُنِىَ, [i. e., pass. in form, but neut.<br>\
in signification,] (K,) aor. تِيبَأُ, (L and other<br>\
lexicons,) in which, the و being changed into ى,<br>\
the vowel of the first letter necessarily becomes<br>\
kesr, (TA,) or تُوبَأُ, (S,) inf. n. وَبْءٌ, (K, TA:<br>\
in the CK وَبَأٌ,) or وَبَآءٌ; (S, L, &amp;c.;) and ↓ أَوْبَأَت,<br>\
(S, K,) inf. n. إِيبَآءٌ; (TA;) The land was,<br>\
or became, afflicted with وَبَأ: (K:) or, much<br>\
afflicted with disease. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  وَبَأَ, aor. يَوْبَأُ;<br>\
(K; contr. to rule, which requires that the<br>\
aor. should be يَبَا; MF;) and ↓ وبّأ; He<br>\
put the utensils, or goods, one upon another;<br>\
or packed them up: or he prepared, set in<br>\
order, or arranged, them; syn. عَبَأَ. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  وَبَأَ إِلَيْهِ; (S, K: Ibn-El-Mukarram says, I<br>\
think that Th has mentioned وَبَأْتُ, without tesh-deed; but I am not confident of it; TA;) and<br>\
↓ اوبأ, inf. n. إِيْبَآءٌ; (S, K;) dial. vars. of وَمَأَ<br>\
and أَوْمَأَ; (S;) He made a sign to him: (S, K:)<br>\
or اوبأ اليه signifies he made a sign to him<br>\
with his fingers, forwards, that he should<br>\
approach; and اومأ اليه “ he made a sign to him<br>\
with his fingers, backwards, that he should retire,<br>\
or remain behind. ” So accord. to the K; but<br>\
this is at variance with what the leading lexicographers have transmitted. In the L it is said,<br>\
وبأ اليه and اوبأ are dial. syns. of ومأ and اومأ<br>\
he made a sign to him: or, accord. to some, اومأ<br>\
اليه signifies “ he made a sign with his hand to<br>\
him, (i. e., to a person before him,) turning his<br>\
fingers towards the palm of his hand, in order<br>\
that he should approach him; ” [in doing which,<br>\
the palm of the hand is held towards the person<br>\
beckoned;] and ↓ اوبا أليه he made a sign<br>\
to him; (i. e., to a person behind him,) opening<br>\
his fingers [from the palm] towards the back<br>\
of the hand, in order that he should retire,<br>\
or remain behind; [in doing which, the palm<br>\
of his hand is towards himself]. El-Ferezdak<br>\
says,<br>\
تَرَى النَّاسَ إِنْ سِرْنَا يَسِيرُونَ خَلْفَنَا<br>\
النَّاسِ وَقَّفُوا ↓ وَإِنْ نَحْنُ وَبَّأْنَا إِلَى<br>\
[If we journey on, thou seest the people journey<br>\
on behind us; and if we make a sign to the<br>\
people to remain behind, they stop, one after<br>\
another]. ↓ أَوْبَأْنَا is also read in this verse for<br>\
وَبَّأْنَا. Ibn-Buzruj says, that اومأ signifies “ he<br>\
made a sign with the eyebrows, and the eyes; ”<br>\
and ↓ وبّأ, he made a sign with the hands, and a<br>\
garment, and the head. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَبَأَتْ إِلَيْهِ, aor.<br>\
تَبَأُ, She (a camel) yearned towards it [i. e., towards her young one]; or uttered to it the cry<br>\
produced by yearning: syn. حَنَّتْ. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
وَبَّاَ see 1.<br>\
4<br>\
اوبأ It became unwholesome: syn. صَارَ وَبِيْأً.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See 1.<br>\
-A3-  أُوبِئَ He (a young weaned<br>\
camel) suffered in the stomach from indigestion,<br>\
in consequence of repletion. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  مَاءٌ لَا<br>\
يُوبِئُ, like يُوبِى, Water that does not fail, or<br>\
stop. The like is said of pasture. (TA.)<br>\

تَوَبَّاَ see 10.<br>\

استوبا (S, K,) and ↓ توبّأ (TA) He found,<br>\
or deemed, a country, (S, K,) or water, (TA,)<br>\
unhealthy, or unwholesome: (K, TA:) [see وَبَأٌ:]<br>\
or, much afflicted with disease. (S.)<br>\
وَبَأٌ and ↓ وَبَآءٌ, (S, K,) and also without<br>\
وَبُاَ,<br>\
[وَبًا,] (TA,) Plague, or pestilence; syn.<br>\
طَاعُونٌ: (K:) or a common, or general, [or<br>\
an epidemic,] disease: (S:) or any such<br>\
disease: (K:) or a quickness, and commonness, of death among men. (TA.) Accord.<br>\
to Ibn-En-Nefees, it is a corruption happening to the substance of the air, by reason<br>\
of causes in the heavens or the earth; as<br>\
stinking water, and carcases, such as are the<br>\
result of bloody battles. Accord. to the hakeem<br>\
Dá-ood, it is a change effected in the air by<br>\
events in the higher regions, as the conjunction of<br>\
beaming stars; and by events in the lower<br>\
regions, as bloody battles, and the opening of<br>\
graves, and the ascending of putrid exhalations;<br>\
with which causes conspire the changes of the<br>\
seasons and elements, and the revolutions of the<br>\
universe. They mention also its signs; among<br>\
which are fever, small-pox, defluxions, itch or<br>\
scab, tumours, &amp;c. What is said in the Nuzheh<br>\
necessarily implies that the طاعون is one of<br>\
the different kinds of وبا; as the physicians<br>\
hold to be the case: but the opinion which the<br>\
critics among the professors of practical law and<br>\
the relaters of traditions hold is, that these two<br>\
diseases are distinct, the one from the other; the<br>\
وبا being an unwholesomeness in the air, in consequence of which diseases become common among<br>\
men; and the طاعون being that kind [of disease]<br>\
with which men are smitten by the jinn, or genii:<br>\
an opinion which they corroborate by the words<br>\
in a trad. إِنَّهُ وَحْزُ أَعْدَائِكُمْ مِنَ الجِنِّ [Verily it<br>\
is the unpenetrating thrusting of your enemies<br>\
among the jinn]. (TA.) The pl. of وَبَأٌ is أَوْبَآءُ;<br>\
and of ↓ أَوْبِيَةٌ, وَبَآءٌ (S, K, TA) or أَوْبِئَةٌ. (CK.)<br>\
بِئَةٌ The state of a land being afflicted with<br>\
وَبَأ. (K.)<br>\
أَرْضٌ وَبِئَةٌ, and ↓ وَبِيْئَةٌ, (S, K,) and ↓ مَوْبُوْءَةٌ,<br>\
(S, L,) and مُوبِئَةٌ, (S, K,) a land much, or often,<br>\
afflicted with وَبَأ: (K:) or, much afflicted with<br>\
disease. (S.)<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  وَبِىْءٌ Unwholesome water. (TA.)<br>\
مُوبِئٌ Engendering وَبَأ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  جُرْعَةَ شَرُوبٍ<br>\
أَنْفَعُ مِنْ عَذْبٍ مُوبٍ A draught of brackish water<br>\
is more profitable than sweet water that engenders<br>\
وَبَأ. (A trad.) Here the<br>\
وَبُاَ is omitted in the last<br>\
word to assimilate it to شروب. It is a proverb,<br>\
applied to two men; one, superior in station,<br>\
and more slim; the other, inferior in station, but<br>\
more useful. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See أَرْضٌ وَبِئَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b4-  مُوبِئٌ<br>\
Water that is little in quantity; and failing, or<br>\
stopping. (K.)<br>\
