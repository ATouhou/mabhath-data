وَمَأَ إِلَيْهِ, (S, K,) aor. يَمَأُ, inf. n. وَمْءٌ; (S;)<br>\
and ↓ اومأ, (S, K, which is the chaste word, MF,)<br>\
inf. n. إِيمَآءٌ; (TA;) and ↓ ومّأ; (K;) He made<br>\
a sign to him. (K.) أَوْمَيْتُ [for أَوْمَأْتُ] is disallowed: (S:) [but see what follows in this<br>\
paragraph]. Lth says, that الايماء is the making<br>\
a sign with the head or the hand, as a sick man<br>\
does with his head for the inclination and prostration in prayer: (TA:) and اومأ بِرَأْسِهِ sometimes signifies He [made a sign with his head<br>\
as though he] said “ No: ” Akh cites this verse:<br>\
إِذَا قَلَّ مَالُ المَرْءِ قَلَّ صَدِيقُهُ<br>\
وَأَوْمَتْ إِلَيْهِ بِالعُيُونِ الأَصَابِعُ<br>\
[When the man&#39;s wealth becomes little, his friends<br>\
become few; and the fingers, together with the<br>\
eyes, make signs to him]; in which اومت is for<br>\
اومأت. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [For a further explanation of<br>\
اومأ, and the manner in which it is said to<br>\
differ from اوبأ, see art. وبأ.]<br>\

is no such root as ومى:] He took away the<br>\
thing. (TA.)<br>\

فُلَانٌ يُوَامِئُ فُلَانًا, and يُوَائِمُ, [Such a one<br>\
agrees, or vies, with such a one]. These two<br>\
verbs are of two different dialects, or the former<br>\
is formed by transposition from the latter. (K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ISh quotes,<br>\
فَأَنَا الغذَاةَ مُوَامِئُهْ<br>\

the morning, shall see him, or it: ” syn. مُعَايِنُهُ.<br>\

استومى عَلَى الأَمْرِ [for استومأ: as there<br>\
is no such root as ومى:] He made himself<br>\
master of the thing: like استولى. (Fr.)<br>\
وَامِئَةٌ A misfortune; calamity: (S, K:)<br>\
thought by ISd to be a subst. [not an act. part.<br>\
n.] because no verb from which it could be<br>\
derived is known. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَقَعَ فِى وَامِئَةٍ He<br>\
fell into a misfortune or calamity. (S.) ―<br>\

has taken it away: (M, K:) or, who has taken<br>\
it. (Yaakoob, S.) The phrase without negation<br>\
is also used. (L.) [See a similar phrase<br>\
in art. لمأ.]<br>\
