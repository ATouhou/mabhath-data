load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'ويحوَيْحٌ a word denoting compassion, or pity:<br>\
(AZ, As, S, K:) وَيْلٌ denotes [an imprecation<br>\
of] punishment; (S;) or [of] removal from<br>\
good, or from prosperity: (AZ, As:) or [of]<br>\
destruction: (AZ:) and وَيْسٌ denotes the same<br>\
as ويح; (AZ;) or less than ويح: (As:) or<br>\
ويح and ويس denote compassion, or pity, and<br>\
admiration of one&#39;s beauty; as when you say of<br>\
a child, وَيْحَهُ مَا أَمْلَحَهُ, and وَيْسَهُ ما املحه,<br>\
[Mercy on him! or the like: how beautiful is<br>\
he!] (Kh) or, accord. to most of the lexicologists, ويل is a word said to, or of, any one<br>\
who falls into destruction or trial, or misfortune,<br>\
and on whom one does not wish God&#39;s mercy:<br>\
and ويح is said to, or of, any one who falls into<br>\
trial or misfortune, and for whom one wishes<br>\
God&#39;s mercy, and his escape therefrom: the<br>\
former word being so used in the Kur-án, and<br>\
the latter by the Prophet: (T:) or ويل is said<br>\
to, or of, him who falls into destruction: and<br>\
ويح is a word by which one chides him who is<br>\
at the point of falling into destruction: (Sb:)<br>\
or ويح and ويل are syn., (Yz, En-Nadr, S,<br>\
Ibn-Et-Faraj,) and ويس signifies the same:<br>\
(Ibn-El-Faraj:) or ويح is a little softer, or<br>\
more gentle, than ويل: (En-Nadr:) [if so,<br>\
وَيْحَهُ signifies woe to him: in the same, or in a<br>\
milder, manner than وَيْلَهُ:] or the original of<br>\
ويح is وَيْ; sometimes ح being added to this<br>\
latter word, and sometimes ل and sometimes<br>\
ب, and sometimes س; (K;) so that it becomes<br>\
ويح and ويل and ويب and ويس. (TA.) [See<br>\
ويل and ويب and ويس and وي.] You say وَيْحٌ<br>\
لِزَيْدٍ [Mercy on Zeyd! or woe to Zeyd!]; putting<br>\
ويح in the nom. case as an inchoative; (S, K;)<br>\
and in like manner, وَيْلٌ لِزَيْدٍ: (S:) and also<br>\
وَيْحًا لِزَيْدٍ; putting ويح in the acc. case because<br>\
of a verb understood; (S, K;) as though you<br>\
said أَلْزَمَهُ اللّٰهُ وَيْحًا [May God make mercy, or<br>\
woe, to attend him constantly!]; and in like<br>\
manner, وَيْلًا لِزَيْدٍ: (S:) or [it is put in the<br>\
acc. case as an absolute complement of a verb<br>\
understood, i. e., as an inf. n., and] the meaning<br>\
is أَتَرَحَّمُهُ تَرَحُّمًا. [I say, May God have mercy<br>\
on him! emphatically]: (Z, in the Fáïk:) you<br>\
also say وَيْحَكَ, and وَيْحَ زَيْدٍ; (S, K;) making<br>\
ويح a prefixed n.; (S;) and putting it in the<br>\
acc. case again because of a verb understood;<br>\
(S, K;) and in like manner, وَيْلَكَ, and وَيْلَ زَيْدٍ:<br>\
(S:) and also وَيْحَمَا زَيْدٍ in the same sense.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
