تورّأت عَلَيْهِ الأَرْضُ i. q. تودّأت, The earth<br>\
became even, or plain, over him: or enclosed<br>\
him: &amp;c. (IJ, K.)<br>\
10<br>\
استورأتِ الإِبِلُ The camels took fright and<br>\
ran away, in a body, one after another: (As:)<br>\
accord. to AZ, this is said when they have taken<br>\
fright and ascended a mountain; but if they<br>\
have taken fright and run away in a plain, one<br>\
says استأورت: so in the dial. of the tribe of<br>\
&#39;Okeyl. [Thus in the TA in this art.: but see<br>\
إِسْتَؤَرتْ.]<br>\
وَرَآءَ and وَرَآءُ and وَرَآءِ, indecl., (K,) an adverbial<br>\
noun of place or time: (Bd, &amp;c.:) J mentions<br>\
it in art. ورى, regarding the<br>\
وَرُاَ as substituted for<br>\
ى; and this is the opinion of the Koofees, and<br>\
of all writers on inflexion, though disapproved<br>\
by F, who, however, mentions it again in art.<br>\
ورى as though belonging to that art.: (TA:)<br>\
Behind: and, contr., before. (K.) In like<br>\
manner, الوَرَآءُ [The location that is behind, or<br>\
beyond; and the time past: and, contr. that is<br>\
before, or preceding]. (K.) Or it does not bear<br>\
contr. meanings; but one meaning; namely,<br>\
what is concealed from one. (K, art. ورى.) Or<br>\
it is a homonym; [but not a word of contr.<br>\
meanings; as it signifies what is behind, or beyond, in respect of place, and what is before in<br>\
respect of time]. Fr. says, It is not allowable to<br>\
say, of a man behind thee, that he is بَيْنَ يَدَيْكَ;<br>\
nor of a man before thee, that he is وَرَآءَك; these<br>\
expressions being only allowable [as synonymous]<br>\
in cases relating to particular times of events or<br>\
actions: thus one may say, وَرَآءَكَ بَرْدٌ شَدِيدٌ and<br>\
بَيْنَ يَدَيْكَ برد شديد [meaning Before thee is<br>\
intense cold]: each of these expressions is allowable because the intense cold is a thing that is<br>\
coming; so, as it will overtake thee, it is, as<br>\
it were, behind thee; and as thou wilt attain<br>\
to the period thereof, it is, as it were, before<br>\
thee. It is said in the Kur, [xviii. 78,] كَانَ<br>\
وَرَآءَهُمْ مَلِكٌ There was before them a king:<br>\
[because it has reference to a certain period,<br>\
which might be said to be before them as they<br>\
would attain to it, and behind them as it would<br>\
overtake them: this passage Jelál-ed-Deen explains by saying, “there was behind them when<br>\
they returned, and before them now, a king. ”]<br>\
Of the same kind also is the phrase مِن وَرَائِهِ جَهَنَّمُ<br>\
[Kur, xiv. 19,] Before him is hell: [for the same<br>\
reason]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَيَكْفُرُونَ بِما وَرَآءَهُ, [Kur,<br>\
ii. 85,] signifies And they disbelieve in what<br>\
[hath been revealed] beside that: syn. سِوَاهُ:<br>\
(IAar:) or it may mean after that. (Jel.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  وراء is masc. and fem. (TA.) Its dim. is<br>\
وُرَيِّئَةٌ, (K,) accord. to those who hold the<br>\
وَرُاَ to be<br>\
a radical letter, not substituted for ى; namely,<br>\
the Basrees: accord. to others, وُرَيَّةٌ and وُرَىٌّ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [See also art. ورى.] ―<br>\
-b5-  رَجُلٌ مَانِعٌ مَا<br>\

-b6-  وَرَآءٌ A son&#39;s son, or<br>\
son&#39;s offspring. (K.) ―<br>\

in the أَلْوَاح, or shoulder-blades. (AAF.)<br>\
