وَحُشَ, aor.<br>\
وَحُشَ, [inf. n., probably, وُحُوشَةٌ or<br>\
وَحَاشَةٌ or both,] It (a place) abounded with wild<br>\
animals. (IKtt.) [The meaning assigned to this<br>\
verb in Freytag&#39;s Lex. belongs not to it, but to<br>\
وَخُشَ.]<br>\
-A2-  وَحَشَ بِهِ, or بِهَا,] aor. يَحِشُ, (IAar,<br>\
K,) inf. n. وَحْشٌ; (TK;) and بِهِ ↓ وحّش, (S,<br>\
K,) or بِهَا, (S, A,) which latter form of the verb<br>\
is disapproved by IAar, but both are correct;<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ توحّش [app. used alone, the objective complement being understood]; (TA;)<br>\
He threw it, or them, away, (S, K,) or to a<br>\
distance, (A,) namely, his garment, (S, K,) or<br>\
his garments, (A,) and his sword, (TA,) and his<br>\
spear, (S, TA,) and his weapon, or weapons,<br>\
(S, A,) or anything, (TA,) to lighten himself,<br>\
(A,) or his beast of carriage, (TA,) in fear of<br>\
his being overtaken: (S, K:) [or in any case;<br>\
for] it is said in a trad. of El-Ows and ElKhazraj, فَوَحَشُوا بِأَسْلِحَتِهِمْ واعْتَنَقَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا<br>\
[Then they threw away their weapons, and embraced one another]. (TA.)<br>\

اوحش It (a place, A, Msb, or a place of<br>\
alighting or abode, S, K) was, or became, desolate,<br>\
deserted, or destitute of human beings; (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K,) the people having gone from it; (S,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ توحّش. (A, Msb, K.) And [in<br>\
like manner you say of a land,] الأَرْضُ ↓ توحّشت,<br>\
[and ↓ استوحشت, (see أَرْضٌ وَحْشَةٌ, voce وَحْشٌ,)]<br>\
The land was, or became وَحْشَة (S, TA) [i. e.<br>\
desolate, deserted, &amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b2-  He (a man) was, or<br>\
became, hungry; (S, A, K, TA;) not having<br>\
eaten anything, so that his inside was empty;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ توحّش: (A:) or the latter<br>\
signifies his belly became empty by reason of<br>\
hunger. (S, K.) Also the former, His provisions<br>\
became spent, or exhausted. (S, K.) You say,<br>\
قَدْ أَوْحَشْنَا مُنْذُ لَيْلَتَيْنِ Our provisions have been<br>\
spent for two nights. (S.) You say also, ↓ توحّش<br>\
لِلدَّوَآءِ (S, A, K *) He made himself hungry;<br>\
(A;) or made his inside, (S,) or his stomach,<br>\
(K,) empty of food (S, K) and beverage; (K;)<br>\
for the purpose of drinking medicine. (S, * A, *<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A2-  اوحش الأَرْضَ He found the land to be<br>\
وَحْشَة (As, S, K) [i. e. desolate, deserted, or<br>\
destitute of human beings ―<br>\
-b2-  اوحش الرَّجُلَ (S,<br>\
A) He made the man lonely, or solitary; and<br>\
sad, sorrowful, or disquieted or troubled in mind;<br>\
[by his absence, or withdrawal of himself; and<br>\
afraid;] or he made him to feel, or experience,<br>\
وَحْشَة [i. e. loneliness, or solitude, &amp;c.]; (S;)<br>\
contr. of آنَسَهُ, (S, K, in art. أنس,) inf. n. إِينَاسٌ.<br>\
(S, in that art.) Hence the saying of the people<br>\
of Mekkeh, [and of Egypt,] أَوْحَشْتَنَا [Thou hast<br>\
made us lonely, &amp;c., by thine absence]. (TA.)<br>\
[See also an ex. from a poet, voce أُنْسٌ: And<br>\
see its quasi-pass., 10.]<br>\
5<br>\
توحّش He (a beast) became wild, or shy;<br>\
syn. أَبَدَ, (S, A, K, &amp;c., in art. أبد,) and تَأَبَّدَ.<br>\
(A, L, in that art.) And He (a man) became<br>\
unsocial, unsociable, unfamiliar, or shy; like a<br>\
wild animal; syn. أَبِدَ, (S, K, ubi supra,) and<br>\
تَأَبَّدَ: (A, K, ubi supra;) and ↓ استوحش signifies the same; (see this verb below;) or he<br>\
became, or made himself, as though on a par with<br>\
the wild animals; expl. by لَحِقَ بَالْوَحْشِ. (TA.)<br>\
[See exs. of both voce أَنِسَ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 4, in<br>\
five places. ―<br>\
-b3-  And see 1.<br>\
10<br>\
استوحش: see 5. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also quasi-pass.<br>\
of أَوْحَشَ الرَّجُلَ, (S, TA,) and [thus] signifies<br>\
He felt, or experienced, وَحْشَة [i. e. loneliness, or<br>\
solitude, &amp;c.; and sadness, grief, sorrow, or disquietude or trouble of mind, &amp;c.; and fear, &amp;c.].<br>\
(S, * K, TA.) And استوحش إِلَى الشَّىْءِ [He felt<br>\
a want of the thing]. (K, voce عُرِىَ, q. v.) You<br>\
say also استوحش مِنْهُ, (A, TA,) or عَنْهُ, (Msb,)<br>\
[meaning He was afraid of, or feared, him, or<br>\
it; agreeably with an explanation of the inf. n.<br>\
in Har, p. 331: see also an instance below, voce<br>\
وَحْشٌ: or] meaning he was shy of him; averse<br>\

-b3-<br>\
استوحشت الأَرْضُ: see 4.<br>\
-A2-  [He deemed a word,<br>\
or sound, &amp;c., strange, or uncouth.]<br>\
حِشَةٌ: pl. حِشُونَ: see وَحْشٌ.<br>\
وَحْشٌ, applied to a country, or region, (S, K,)<br>\
and a place, (TA,) and a house (داَرٌ), (A,) and<br>\
[its fem.] وَحْشَةٌ, applied to a land (أَرْضٌ), (S,<br>\
TA,) to a house (دار); (A;) Desolate, deserted,<br>\
or destitute of human beings or inhabitants; (S,<br>\
K, TA;) as also ↓ مُوحِشٌ and ↓ مُتَوَحِّشٌ: (A:)<br>\
and أَرْضٌ وَحْشَةٌ and ↓ مُسْتَوْحِشَةٌ signify the same.<br>\
(K, TA.) You say also, بِلَادٌ حِشُونَ Countries,<br>\
or regions, desolate, deserted, &amp;c.; after the<br>\
manner of سِنُونَ; and in the accus. and gen.,<br>\
حِشِينَ: pl., as Az says, of ↓ حِشَةٌ, originally<br>\
وَحْشٌ, [So I read instead of وَحْشَة, which is<br>\
evidently a mistranscription,] the و being wanting, as it is in زِنَةٌ and صِلَةٌ and عِدَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
You also say, لَقِيتُهُ بِوَحْشِ إِصْمِتَ, (S, K,) and<br>\
إِصْمِتَةَ, (TA,) i. e., I found him, or met him, in<br>\
a desolate, or deserted, country, or region. (S,<br>\
K.) [See remarks on the last word in the<br>\
former phrase in art. صمت.] And in like<br>\
manner, تَرَكْتُهُ بِوَحْشِ المَتْنِ I left him in the<br>\
desert part of the elevated plain, where one could<br>\
not reach him. (L, TA. *) And [hence] حِمَارُ<br>\
وَحْشٍ An ass of a desert; [i. e. a wild ass;] as<br>\
also حِمَارٌ وَحْشِىٌّ. (S, K.) [And بَقَرُ الوَحْشِ<br>\
The bull and cow, or bulls and cows, collectively,<br>\
of the desert; i. e., the wild bull and cow, or<br>\
bulls and cows.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence also] Animals (حَيَوَان<br>\
[which is used as a sing. and a pl., but is here<br>\
meant to be understood collectively, as appears<br>\
from what follows,]) of the desert, (S, A, K,<br>\
TA,) such as are not tame; (TA;) [i. e. wild<br>\
animals;] of the fem. gender; (TA;) as also<br>\
وُحُوشٌ (S) and ↓ وَحِيشٌ: (K:) these three words<br>\
are all used in a collective sense: (ISh:) and<br>\
↓ وَحْشِىٌّ signifies a single one of such animals;<br>\
(S, K;) like زَنْجِىٌّ in relation to زَنْجٌ, and رُومِىٌّ<br>\
to رُومٌ: (TA:) or وَحْشٌ signifies such as is not<br>\
tame, of beasts of the desert; and everything that<br>\
is afraid of human beings (كُلُّ شَىْءٍ يَسْتَوْحِشُ<br>\
عَنِ النَّاسِ); as also ↓ وَحْشِىٌّ, as though the ى<br>\
were a corroborative, as in دوَّارِىٌّ: or, accord.<br>\
to El-Fárábee, وَحْشٌ in the pl. [lexicologically,<br>\
but not in the language of the grammarians] of<br>\
↓ وَحْشِىٌّ, like as رُومٌ is of رُومِىٌّ: (Msb:) or it<br>\
is used as a sing., as well as collectively; for<br>\
you say, هٰذَا وَحْشٌ ضَخْمٌ [this is a bulky wild<br>\
animal], and هٰذِهِ شَاةٌ وَحْشٌ [this is a wild sheep<br>\
or goat, &amp;c.]: (ISh:) وُحُوشٌ is a pl. of وَحْشٌ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) and so is وُحْشَانٌ, (Sgh, K,) and so<br>\
is وَحِيشٌ, [lexicologically, but grammarians<br>\
term it a quasi-pl. n.,] like as ضَئِينٌ is of ضَأْنٌ:<br>\
(Sgh, TA:) or وُحُوشٌ is its only broken pl.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also, Wild, or shy; applied<br>\
to girls or women: see an ex. of the word in<br>\
this sense voce تَوٌّ, where it has a redundant ن<br>\
affixed to it.] ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence also] Lone; solitary;<br>\
without company. You say. مَشَى فِى الأَرْضِ<br>\
وَحْشًا He walked, or went, in the land alone,<br>\
having no other with him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence<br>\
also] Hungry; (S, A, K;) as also ↓ مُوحِشٌ,<br>\
(AZ, A,) and ↓ مُتَوَحِّشٌ, (A,) and ↓ وَحِشٌ:<br>\
(TA:) pl. of the first, أَوْحَاشٌ (S, A, K) [and<br>\
وَحْشُونَ]. You say, بَاتَ فُلَانٌ وَحْشًا, (S, A, *<br>\
K, *) and مُوحِشًا, and مُتَوَحِّشًا, (A,) Such a one<br>\
passed the night hungry, (S, A, K,) not having<br>\
eaten anything, so that his inside was empty.<br>\
(TA.) And بِتْنَا وَحْشِينَ We passed the night<br>\
without food. (TA.) [In another place in the<br>\
TA, we find لَقَدْ بِتْنَا لَيْلَتَنَا هٰذِهِ وَحْشِى, and so<br>\
in the L; the last word being evidently a<br>\
mistranscription, for وَحْشِينَ: and it is added,<br>\
as though the speaker meant, جَمَاعَةَ وَحْشَى;<br>\
doubtless a mistake for جَمَاعَةَ وَحْشٍ so that the<br>\
saying seems to mean, We have passed this our<br>\
night like a company of wild animals.]<br>\
وَحِشٌ: see وَحْشٌ, last signification.<br>\
وَحْشَةٌ Loneliness; solitude; lonesomeness; solitariness; desolateness; syn. خَلْوَةٌ: (S, K:)<br>\
sadness; grief; sorrow; disquietude, or trouble,<br>\
of mind: (S, K, TA:) or sadness, &amp;c., arising<br>\
from loneliness or solitude: (TA:) fear: (K,<br>\
TA:) or fear, or fright, arising from loneliness<br>\
or solitude: (TA:) a state of disunion between<br>\
men, and remoteness of hearts from feelings of<br>\
love or affection; from وَحْشٌ signifying “ a<br>\
wild beast,” or “ wild beasts, of the desert: ”<br>\
(Msb:) unsociableness; unfriendliness; unsocialness; unfamiliarity; shyness; wildness: [in all<br>\
the above senses] contr. of أُنْسٌ. (T, S, A, K,<br>\
in art. أنس.) [Hence, لَيْلَةُ الوَحْشَةِ The night of<br>\
loneliness, &amp;c.; the first night after burial: also<br>\
called لَيْلَةُ الوَحْدَةِ, q. v.] You say, تَرَكْتُهُ فِى<br>\
وَحْشَةٍ I left him in loneliness, or solitude. (TK.)<br>\
And أَخَذَتْهُ الوَحْشَةُ Sadness, grief, sorrow, or<br>\
disquietude or trouble of mind, or sadness, &amp;c.,<br>\
arising from loneliness or solitude, laid hold upon<br>\
him. (TA.)<br>\
وَحْشِىٌّ [Of, or belonging to, or relating to, the<br>\
desert: and hence, wild; untamed; undomesticated; uncivilized; unfamiliar: and often used<br>\
as an epithet in which the quality of a subst. is<br>\
predominant]: see وَحْشٌ, in three places: i. q.<br>\
حُوشِىٌّ; (S, Msb, art. حوش;) contr. of أَهْلِىٌّ.<br>\
(TA, in art. اهل.) ―<br>\
-b2-  كَلَامٌ وَحْشِىٌّ (tropical:)  i. q. حُوشِىٌّ,<br>\
q. v. (S, A, art. حوش:) and in like manner,<br>\
↓ لَفْظَةٌ وَحْشِيَّةٌ (tropical:)  i. q. حُوشِيَّةٌ. (Mz, 13th نوع.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  The right side of anything: (AZ, AA, S,<br>\
K, &amp;c.:) or the left side (As, S, A, K,) of anything. (As, S.) [For more full explanations of<br>\
this term, and its contr. إِنْسِىٌّ, in relation to a<br>\
beast and to a man, see the latter term: of a<br>\
beast, accord. to most authorities, it is The right,<br>\
far or off, side. See an ex. in a verse cited<br>\
voce دَفٌّ.] Of the arm or hand, and of the leg<br>\
or foot, The back; إِنْسِىٌّ signifying the side that<br>\
is towards the man: (S:) or of the foot, the<br>\
former means [the outer side, or] the side that is<br>\
the more remote from the other foot; the latter<br>\
being the contr., or that which is towards the<br>\
other foot. (TA.) Of a bow, (S, K,) or of a<br>\
Persian bow, (TA,) The back; and إِنْسِىٌّ, the<br>\
side that is towards thee: (S, K:) or of a bow,<br>\
whether Persian or not is not said, the former<br>\
means the side against which the arrow does not<br>\
lie. (TA.) And ↓ الجَانِبُ الوَحِيشُ signifies the<br>\
same as الوَحْشِىُّ. (IAar.) ―<br>\
-b4-  A sort of fig,<br>\
that grows in the mountains and in the remote<br>\
parts of valleys, of every colour, black and red<br>\
and white; it is the smallest of figs, [in the TA,<br>\
smaller than the تبن,] and when eaten newly<br>\
plucked it burns the mouth; but it is dried. (AHn,<br>\
L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  وَحْشِيَّةٌ [or رِيحٌ وَحْشِيَّةٌ] A wind that<br>\
enters one&#39;s clothes, by reason of its vehemence. (K.)<br>\
وَحْشَانُ, applied to a man, Sad; sorrowful:<br>\
pl. وَحَاشَى. (K.)<br>\
وَحِيشٌ: see وَحْشٌ, (of which it is a quasi-pl.<br>\
n.,) in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see وَحْشِىٌّ.<br>\
مُوحِشٌ: see وَحْشٌ, first sentence, and near the<br>\
end.<br>\
أَرْضٌ مَوْحُوشَةٌ A land having, (Fr, S, A,) or<br>\
abounding with, (K,) wild animals, or animals<br>\
of the desert. (Fr, S, A, K.) [See أَرْضٌ مَجْرُوَدةٌ,<br>\
in art. جرد.] In [some of] the copies of the K,<br>\
مُوحِشَةٌ, which is a mistake. (TA.)<br>\
