وَرَسَ, inf. n. وُرُوسٌ, It (a plant) became<br>\
green. (AA, A, Hn, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 4. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
وَرِسَ, (M, K,) aor. يَوْرَسُ, (K,) It (a rock, M,<br>\
K, in water, K) became overspread with [the<br>\
green substance called] طُحْلُب, so that it became<br>\

ورّسهُ, inf. n. تَوْرِيسٌ, He dyed it (a garment,<br>\
or piece of cloth,) with وَرْس, q. v. (S, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اورس المَكَانُ The place produced the plant<br>\
called وَرْس. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اورس الرِّمْثُ The [trees<br>\
called] رمث produced وَرْس, a thing yellow like<br>\
the [garments termed] مُلَآء; as also ↓ وَرَسَ: so<br>\
it is asserted, on trustworthy authority: (M:)<br>\
or became yellow in their leaves, (S, K,) after<br>\
attaining to maturity, (S,) and had upon them<br>\
what was like yellow مُلَآء; (S, K;) and in like<br>\
manner one says of a place, اورس المَكَانُ: (TA:)<br>\
or became yellow in its fruit: (A:) ―<br>\
-b3-  اورس<br>\
الشَّجَرُ The trees put forth leaves; (K;) as also<br>\
↓ وَرِسَ. (IKtt.)<br>\
وَرْسٌ A certain plant, (S, A, Msb, K,) of a<br>\
yellow colour, (S, Msb,) resembling sesame, (A,<br>\
K,) with which one dyes, (A, Msb,) and of which<br>\
is made the [liniment called] غُمْرَة for the face,<br>\
(S,) existing in El-Yemen, (S, K,) and nowhere<br>\
else, (K,) being there sown; (Msb;) it is not<br>\
wild, but is sown one year, and remains ten years,<br>\
(AHn, M,) or twenty years, (K,) without ceasing<br>\
to be profitable, resembling sesame in its manner<br>\
of growth; and when it dries, on its attaining to<br>\
maturity, its pericarps (خَرَائِط) burst, and it is<br>\
shaken, and the وَرْس shakes out from it: (AHn,<br>\
M,) it is useful for the [discolouration of the face<br>\
termed] كَلَف, used as a liniment; and for the<br>\
[leprous-like discolouration of the skin termed<br>\
بَهَق, [prepared] as a drink; and the wearing<br>\
of a garment dyed with it strengthens the venereal<br>\
faculty: (K:) or a certain yellow dye: or, as<br>\
some say, a certain plant, of sweet odour: or, as<br>\
is said in the قَانُون [of Ibn-Seenà, or Avicenna,]<br>\
a certain thing of an intensely red colour, resembling powdered saffron, brought from El-Yemen,<br>\
and said to be scraped or rubbed off, or to fall<br>\
off, from its trees: (Mgh:) or, as some say, a<br>\
species of كُرْكُم, q. v.: or, as some say, resembling كُرْكُم: (Msb:) or a certain thing, yellow,<br>\
like the [garments of the kind called مُلَآء, that<br>\
comes forth upon the [trees called] رِمْث, between<br>\
the last part of summer and the first part of<br>\
winter, (M, TA,) which, when it touches a garment, soils it: (TA:) or it also, sometimes, [accord.<br>\
to certain persons who seems to misapply the<br>\
word, is a substance which] pertains to the [trees<br>\
called] عَرْعَر and رِمْث, and to other trees, above<br>\
all in Abyssinia; but this is inferior to that first<br>\
mentioned (K, TA) in virtue and properties: as<br>\
to that of the عرعر, it is found between its rind<br>\
and the main substance, when it dries up; and<br>\
when it is rubbed, it rubs off; and there is no<br>\
good in it; but ورس [properly so called] is adulterated with it: and as to that of the رمث, when<br>\
it is the end of summer, and it has attained its<br>\
utmost state, it becomes intensely yellow, so that<br>\
what envelops it becomes yellow, and with this<br>\
also one adulterates: so says AHn: (TA:) ورس<br>\
is called in Persian اسپرك [إِسْپَرِكْ]; and in<br>\
Turkish, آلاجهره. (TK.) [Freytag adds to what<br>\
he has given on this word from the K, S, TK.<br>\
as follows: “ Memecylon tinctorium. Sprengel.<br>\
hist. med., t. ii., p. 444, ed. tert. (ubi ورز scriptum est). Spreng. hist. rei herb., t. i., p. 258.<br>\
Avicenn. p. 165 ”]<br>\
وَرِسٌ: see وَرِيسٌ.<br>\
وَرْسِىٌّ A yellow bowl: (A:) or a bowl made<br>\
of نُضَار, (M,) which is a yellow wood: (TA:)<br>\
or of the best kind of those made of نُضَار. (Lth,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A pigeon that is red inclining to yellowness: (M:) or a pigeon inclining to redness and<br>\
yellowness. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also وَرِيسٌ.<br>\
وَرِيسٌ A garment dyed with وَرْس; as also<br>\
↓ وَرِسٌ and ↓ وَارِسٌ (M) and ↓ مُوَرَّسٌ. (M, A.)<br>\
You say, مَلْحَفَةٌ وِرِيسَةٌ, (so in some copies of<br>\
the S and K) or ↓ وَرْسِيَّةٌ, (as in other copies of<br>\
the S and K, and thus in a copy of the Msb,)<br>\
[An outer wrapping garment] dyed with وس;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) i. q. ↓ مُوَرَّسَةٌ; (K;) which latter<br>\
epithet is sometimes used. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
وَارِسٌ.<br>\
وَارِسٌ applied to a place [Producing the plant<br>\
called وَرْس]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to a tree of the<br>\
kind called رِمْث, Producing وَرْس, a thing yellow<br>\
like the [garments termed] مُلَآء: (M:) or becoming yellow in the leaves, (S, K,) after attaining to maturity, (S,) and having upon it what is<br>\
like yellow مُلَآءُ: (S, K:) or becoming yellow<br>\
in its fruit: (A:) or, app., having وَرْس, like as<br>\
تَامِرٌ signifies “ possessing dates; ” (AHn;) and<br>\
↓ وَرِيسٌ likewise has the last of these significations: (TA:) ↓ مُورِسٌ also signifies the same<br>\
as وَارِسٌ, applied to a tree of the kind abovementioned; (A, K;) but is very rare, though<br>\
agreeable with analogy: (K:) it is said (M)<br>\
one should not say مُوْرِسٌ; (S, M;) but it occurs<br>\
in a poem of Ibn-Harmeh. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Applied<br>\
to a tree [of any other kind], Putting forth<br>\
leaves. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Applied to a plant, Becoming<br>\
green. (M.) You say also, صَخْرَةٌ وَارِسَةٌ بِالطُّحْلُبِ,<br>\
A rock overspread with the green substance called<br>\
طحلب, so that it is green and smooth: see 1].<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  It also denotes intenseness of colour, in<br>\
the phrase أَصْفَرُ وَارِسٌ Yellow intensely bright.<br>\
(M.) And [in like manner] you say, جَمَلٌ وَارِسُ<br>\
الحُمْرَةِ A camel intensely red. (Sgh.) And<br>\
زَعْفَرَانٌ وَارِسٌ [app., Bright-coloured saffron].<br>\
