K,) beneath the clear portion; (T, Msb;) as,<br>\

in want of milk: (T:) or flour; and what is not<br>\
drunk, as bread, and the like: (TA:) or the<br>\
refuse, or worse sort, of طَعَام [i. e. wheat, or<br>\

ثَفِلٌ (tropical:)  One who eats ثُفْل. (K. [It seems to be<br>\
there indicated that the latter word is to be understood in this case in the former of the senses<br>\
assigned to it above; but it is not so.]) One says,<br>\
لَيْسَ الثَّفِلُ كَالْمَحِضِ, i. e. (tropical:)  He who eats ثُفْل<br>\
[or grain, &amp;c.,] is not like him who drinks pure<br>\

ثُفْل, i. e. grain, (T, S, M, K, TA,) or flesh-meat,<br>\
or bread, or dates, (T,) [&amp;c.,] being in want of<br>\
milk; (T, S;) the hardest of the means of subsistence (T, S, M) to the Bedawee. (T, S.)<br>\
ثُفْلَةٌ, (T,) or ثَفَلَةٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  Somewhat remaining (T) of dates, in a sack: on the authority of<br>\

not rise and go save with reluctance: (T:) the<br>\

generality of books; but in the Tekmileh [of the<br>\
&#39;Eyn] ↓ ثِفَالٌ, and there said to be applied to a<br>\
beast and to a man. (Mgh.)<br>\
ثُفَالٌ: see the paragraph next following.<br>\
ثفَالٌ The thing by which the mill is preserved<br>\
from the ground; as also ↓ ثُفْلٌ: (M, K:) it is a<br>\
skin that is spread beneath the hand-mill to preserve the flour from the dust; (T;) a skin, (S,<br>\
Msb,) or the like, that is put beneath the mill,<br>\
(Msb,) [i. e.,] which is spread, and whereon is<br>\
placed the mill, which is turned with the hand,<br>\
(S,) in order that the flour may fall upon it. (S,<br>\
Msb.) When the ثفال has another thing to preserve it from the ground, this latter is called the<br>\
وِفَاض. (M.) Zuheyr says, (T, S, K,) describing<br>\
war, (T,)<br>\
فَتَعْرُكُكُمْ عَرْكَ الرَّحَىبِثِفَالِهَا<br>\
(T, S, K, *) meaning [And it frets you as frets the<br>\
mill] when it is with its ثفال: for they do not<br>\
place a ثفال beneath the mill except when grinding.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (sometimes, S,) The nether, or<br>\
lower, mill-stone; (S, K;) and so ↓ ثُفَالٌ. (K.) ―<br>\

washing the hand therewith. (T, M.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
