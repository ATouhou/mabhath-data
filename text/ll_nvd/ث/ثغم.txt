اثغم It (a valley) produced the kind of plant<br>\
called ثَغَام: (K:) or abounded therewith. (A,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\

ثَغَامٌ A kind of plant, (S, Msb, K, TA,) generally (Msb) found in the mountains, (S, Msb,)<br>\
having a green stem, (TA,) which becomes white<br>\
when it dries, (S, Msb, TA,) and to which hoariness is likened; (S, Msb; [Golius, app. misled<br>\
by a false reading in a copy of the S, says “ simile<br>\
anetho; ”]) it has a thick [head, or blossom, such<br>\
as is called] سَنَمَة, and [it is said that [it does not<br>\
grow save upon a black mountain-top, and is<br>\
found in Nejd and Tihámeh: (TA:) A &#39;Obeyd<br>\
says that it is a kind of plant, (TA,) IF, that it<br>\
is a tree, (Msb,) with a white blossom and fruit,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) to which hoariness is likened: (TA:)<br>\
it is called in Persian درمنه; (K; [written in<br>\
different copies of that work دِرَمْنَه and دَرَّمْنَه and<br>\
دَرَمْنَه; the last of which is said in the TA to be<br>\
the right reading; a word said to mean wormwood, and hyssop; or, accord. to Meninski, as<br>\
mentioned by Freytag, zedoary; but this last is<br>\
called in Persian زُرُنْبَا, with which word درمنه<br>\
may have been confounded;]) or درمنه اسبيد,<br>\
(S,) or دَرْمَنَه إِسْپِيد, in which [SM thinks] the<br>\
former word is a contraction of دَرْمِيَانَه; the two<br>\
together meaning “ in the middle white: ” (TA:)<br>\
the n. un. is with ة: (S, K:) and ↓ أَثْغَمَآءُ is a<br>\
quasi-pl. n.; (K;) as though the اء were a substitute for the ة of أَثْغِمَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
ثَاغِمٌ A colour white like the ثَغَام: (K:) in the<br>\
L, a head wholly white. (TA.)<br>\
أَثْغِمَآءُ: see ثَغَامٌ.<br>\
