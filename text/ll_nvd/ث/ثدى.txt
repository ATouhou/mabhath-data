ثَدِىَ, aor.<br>\
ثَدَىَ, It became moist or moistened.<br>\
(T, K.) ثَدِيَتِ الأَرْضُ i. q. سَدِيَت [The land<br>\
became moistened by much dew]: mentioned by<br>\
Yaakoob, who asserts that the ث in the former<br>\
is a substitute for the س in the latter; but is not<br>\
known. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  ثَدَاهُ, aor.<br>\
ثَدُىَ (T, K) and<br>\
ثَدِىَ, (T,)<br>\
He moistened it. (T, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And ثداهُ [so in<br>\
the TT, as form the T, without. teshdeed,] He<br>\
fed him, or nourished him: (T, TT:) [or the<br>\
verb in this sense is ↓ ثدّاهُ, for its inf. n.] تَثْدِيَةٌ<br>\
signifies the act of feeding, or nourishing. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
ثَدَّىَ see 1.<br>\
ثَدْىٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ثِدْىٌ<br>\
and ثَدًى: (K:) the first of these is the form<br>\
most commonly obtaining: (TA:) [The breast,<br>\
or mamma;] the part of the chest whereof the<br>\
حَلَمَة is the head; each of the two parts whereof<br>\
the حَلَمَتَانِ are the two heads: (Zj in his “ Khalk<br>\
el-Insán: ”) [and sometimes, but not properly,<br>\
the حَلَمَة alone; i. e., the pap, nipple, or mamilla:] you say ثَدْى مُقْعَدٌ a breast that is swelling, prominent, or protuberant, (S, A, L, K, in<br>\
art. قعد,) that fills the hand, (A in that art.,) and<br>\
has not yet become folding: (S, L, K, in that<br>\
art.:) and رَضَعَ ثَدْىَ أُمِّهِ [he sucked the breast,<br>\
meaning the pap, or nipple, of his mother].<br>\
(IKtt in TA, art. رضع:) it is peculiar to woman;<br>\
(T, K;) or common to woman and man; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) being sometimes used in relation to a<br>\
man; (Msb;) accord. to the opinion held to be<br>\
most chaste and best known by the lexicologists<br>\
[in general]: (TA:) and is masc.; (T, M, Mgh;)<br>\
or masc. and fem.; (S, Msb, K;) but most<br>\
chastely masc.: (TA;) the pl. [of pauc.] is أَثْدٍ,<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K,] [originally أَثْدُىٌ,] of the measure<br>\
أَفْعُلٌ, (Msb,) and [of mult.] ثُدِىٌّ, (S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
[originally ثُدُوىٌ,] of the measure فُعُولٌ, (S, Msb,)<br>\
and ثِدِىٌّ, with kesr to the ث because of the<br>\
kesr to the letter following, (S,) and sometimes<br>\
ثِدَآءٌ, [originally ثِدَاىٌ,] like سِهَامٌ; (Msb;) and<br>\
a poet says,<br>\
وَأَصْبَحَتِ النِّسَآءُ مُسَلِّبَاتٍ<br>\
لَهُنَّ الوَيْلُ يَمْدُدْنَ الثُّدِينَا<br>\
[And the women became widowed, or bereft of<br>\
relations, and without their ornaments, or in<br>\
mourning, having woe, pulling the breasts]; but<br>\
this is something like a mistake; and it may be<br>\
that he meant التُّدِيَّا, and changed the [latter]<br>\
ى into ن for the sake of the rhyme. (M.) It<br>\
is said in a prov., تُجَوَّعُ الحُرَّةُ وَلَا تَأْكُلُ ثَدْيَيْهَا,<br>\
meaning, أُجْرَةَ ثَدْيَيْهَا, [i. e. The ingenuous woman<br>\
will be made to hunger and will not eat the hire<br>\
of her breasts,] the prefixed noun being suppressed; or, as some relate it, بِثَدْيَيْهَا, which is<br>\
plain [as meaning, by means of her breasts]: it<br>\
is applied in relation to a man&#39;s preserving himself<br>\
from ignoble means of acquiring wealth. (Mgh.)<br>\
And جُدَّ ثَدْىُ أُمِّهِ, May his mother&#39;s breast be<br>\
cut off, is a form of imprecation against a man,<br>\
and used to imply a wish for his separation. (As,<br>\
L in art. جد.) The saying of &#39;Alee, on the day<br>\
of his slaughter of the Khawárij, اُنْظُرُوا فَإِنَّ فِيِهمْ<br>\
رَجُلًا إِحْدَى يَدَيْهِ مِثْلُ ثَدْىِ المَرْأَةِ [Look ye, for<br>\
among them is a man one of whose arms is like<br>\
the breast of the woman], not احدى ثَدْيَيْهِ as<br>\
some relate it, was applied to a man who had,<br>\
in the place of one arm, a lump of flesh upon<br>\
his shoulder-joint, which lump, when it was<br>\
stretched, became equal in length to his other<br>\
arm, and when it was left, returned [to its original form]. (Mgh.) Respecting ↓ ثُدَيَّةٌ, the<br>\
dim., whence the surname ذَو الثُّدَيَّةِ, he who<br>\
holds ثَدْىٌ to be masc. [only] says that the ة is<br>\
added because the word [virtually] means اليَد,<br>\
[which is fem.,] for the man thus surnamed had<br>\
a short arm, of the size of the ثَدْى, as is indicated by the fact that they also called him ذُو<br>\
اليُدَيَّةِ: (S:) or, accord. to Fr, (A&#39;Obeyd, T,)<br>\
ة is added, in this instance, in the dim., though<br>\
ثَدْىٌ is masc., because it applies to what resembled the remains (بَقِيَّة) of a ثَدْى, the greater<br>\
part of it having gone, so that it is like لُحَمْيَةٌ and<br>\
شُحَيْمَةٌ [dims. of لَحْمَةٌ and شَحْمَةٌ]: (T, M:) or<br>\
the ة is added because the word is regarded in<br>\
this case as meaning البَضْعَةُ [the piece, or lump,<br>\
of flesh]: (Mgh:) some say that it is the dim.<br>\
of ثَنْدُوَةٌ; (Mgh, TA;) but this requires consideration. (Mgh.)<br>\
ثُدَيَّةٌ: see ثَدْىٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A repository, or receptacle, (AA, K,) of the size of the fist, (AA,)<br>\
in which the horseman carries the [sinews called]<br>\
عَقَب [of which the bow-string is made, and which<br>\
are bound round a bow, and round an arrow, to<br>\
repair a fracture in it, (see عَقَبٌ and عَقَبَ,)]<br>\
and the feathers [which he may require to attach<br>\
to any of his arrows]. (AA, K.)<br>\
ثُدَّآءٌ A certain plant [growing] in the desert. (S.)<br>\
ثَدْيَآءُ A woman large in the ثَدْيَانِ [or breasts]:<br>\
أَثْدَى, the masc. form, is not used. (S, M.)<br>\
ثَنْدُوَةٌ, [written by some ثُنْدُوَةٌ, as well as ثَنْدُؤَةٌ<br>\
and ثَنْدُؤَةٌ,] mentioned here in the S, and in art.<br>\
ثدأ: see the latter art.<br>\
