ثُنْدُوَةٌ, of the measure فُنْعُلَةٌ, with damm to the<br>\
ف and ع, or, accord. to some, the ن is radical<br>\
and the و augmentative, the measure being فُعْلُوَةٌ,<br>\
(Msb in art. ثدى,) or ثُنْدُؤَةٌ and ثَنْدُوَةٌ, (ISk,<br>\
T, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) with damm to the ث if with<br>\

فُعْلُلَةٌ, (ISk, S,) and with fet-h to the ث if with و,<br>\
without ء, (ISk, T, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and in this<br>\
case of the measure فَعْلُوَةٌ, (ISk, S, K,) like قَرْنُوَةٌ<br>\
and عَرْقُوَةٌ, (ISk, S,) [the ن in both cases, accord.<br>\
to ISk, being radical,] so in the Bári&#39;, (Msb,)<br>\
and so says Ktr, (TA,) but A&#39;Obeyd says that<br>\
the Arabs in general pronounced the word without ء, (Msb,) The ثَدْى [which generally signifies the breast, or mamma, but sometimes the<br>\
pap, or mamilla,] of a man: (Mgh:) or the<br>\
part, of a man, that corresponds to the ثَدْى of a<br>\
woman: (T, S, Msb, K:) or the flesh of the<br>\
ثَدْى: (Lth, T, M, Mgh:) or the flesh that is<br>\
around the ثَدْى: (ISk, T, S, K:) or the base of<br>\
the ثَدْى: (As, Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán,” S,<br>\
Msb, K, KL *:) or the portion of flesh that is<br>\
at the base thereof: (Msb:) or i. q. ثَدْىٌ: (TA:)<br>\
and the pap, or mamilla, of a woman and of a<br>\
man: (KL:) accord. to the author of the Wá&#39;ee,<br>\
the pl. [of تندؤة] is ثَنَادِهُ, [with ه substituted for<br>\
ء, unless the former be a mistranscription for the<br>\
latter,] (TA,) and [that of ثندوة is] ثَنَادٍ. (Msb,<br>\
TA.) The word ثدى is used in relation to men<br>\
in the Saheeh of Muslim, and ثندؤة in relation<br>\
to women in the Sunan of Aboo-Dáwood; and<br>\
many of the lexicologists incline to the opinion<br>\
that ثدى is common to men and women. (MF<br>\
