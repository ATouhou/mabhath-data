ثِيلٌ The sheath of the penis of a camel (Lth, *<br>\
AZ, T, S, M, K) &amp;c.; (K;) [i. e.,] of a he-goat<br>\
also, and of a bull: (M:) or the penis itself:<br>\
(Lth, T, M, K:) sometimes also used in relation<br>\
to a man: (M:) and ↓ ثَيْلٌ signifies the same;<br>\
(K;) mentioned by Ibn-&#39;Abbád; and IAth adds<br>\
ثُولٌ. (TA.) Hence the prov., أَخْلَفُ مِنْ ثِيلِ<br>\
الجَمَلِ [More contrary to what is usual than the<br>\
sheath of the penis, or than the penis, of the<br>\
camel]: for the camel, like the lion, is a retromingent. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  A kind of plant; (S, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ ثَيِّلٌ: (K:) a certain plant having a<br>\
root and stem; when short, called نَجْمٌ: and a<br>\
certain herb, or, as some say, a plant, that is<br>\
found on the banks, or sides, of rivers, in meadows: and, some say, a species of the [plants, or<br>\
trees, called] جَنْبَة, which grows in the territory<br>\
of [the tribe of] Temeem, and becomes large, so<br>\
that the sheep, or goats, lie in its shelter: (M:)<br>\
AHn says, (M,) in the “ Book of Plants,”<br>\
(Mgh,) the ثِيل, (M,) or ↓ ثَيِّل, (Mgh,) [both<br>\
appellations now applied to triticum repens, or<br>\
dog&#39;s grass,] is the نَجْمَة; called in Persian<br>\
ريزوپادله [?]; (Mgh;) its leaves are like those of<br>\
wheat, but shorter, and it spreads upon the face<br>\
of the ground, extending far, and becoming com-<br>\
plicated, or tangled, so as to be like felt (M,<br>\
Mgh) upon the ground; (M;) it has many<br>\
joints, or knots, and short internodal portions;<br>\
and scarcely, or never, grows anywhere but over<br>\
water, or in a place beneath which is water; (M,<br>\
Mgh;) and it is one of the plants that are regarded as indicative of the existence of water:<br>\
n. un. with ة: (M:) Lth says that the ثِيل is a<br>\
certain plant that tangles upon the ground: Th,<br>\
on the authority of IAar, says that it is a kind of<br>\
plant said to be that called لِحْيَةُ التَّيْسِ: and Sh<br>\
says that the ثِيلَة is a green small tree [or plant]<br>\
resembling the first shoots that come forth from<br>\
grain. (T.)<br>\
ثَيِّلٌ: see ثِيلٌ, in two places.<br>\
أَثْيَلُ A camel large in the ثِيل; (T, S, M, K;)<br>\
wide therein: (M:) pl. ثِيلٌ. (K.)<br>\
مَثِيلَة A place in which is the kind of plant<br>\
called ثِيل. (Mgh.)<br>\
