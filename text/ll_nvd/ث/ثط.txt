ثَطَّ, aor.<br>\
ثَطَ3َ; (Lth, TA;) [app. accord. to him<br>\
who says رَجُلٌ أَثَطُّ; for Lth adds,] and, accord.<br>\
to him who says رَجُلٌ ثَطٌ, (Lth, TA,) ثَطَّ, aor.<br>\
ثَطِ3َ<br>\
and<br>\
ثَطُ3َ; (Lth, K;) inf. n. [of ثَطَّ of which the aor.<br>\
is<br>\
ثَطَ3َ,] ثَطَطٌ, (Lth, IDrd, S, K,) and [of the verb<br>\
of which the aor. is<br>\
ثَطِ3َ,] ثَطٌّ, and [of that of which<br>\
the aor. is<br>\
ثَطُ3َ, the second pers. of the pret. being<br>\
app. ثَطُطْتَ,] ثَطَاطَةٌ and ثُطُوطَةٌ; (Lth, K;) or<br>\
the last two, accord. to IDrd, are simple substs.,<br>\
and ISd approves of this distinction; (TA;) He<br>\
(a man, Lth, S) was, or became, such as is termed<br>\
ثَطٌّ and أَثَطُّ [explained below]. (Lth, IDrd, S, K.)<br>\
ثَطٌّ and ↓ أَثَطُّ, (Lth, S, K,) but the former is<br>\
the more correct and the more common, (Lth,)<br>\
or the former only, (IDrd, and IB on the authority of Ibn-El-Jawáleekee, and K,) the latter<br>\
being vulgar, (IDrd, K,) but AZ asserted his<br>\
having heard the latter, (AHát, cited in the Jm,)<br>\
[and the latter only is mentioned in the Mgh,] A<br>\
man (S, Mgh) having no hair upon the sides of<br>\
his face, but only upon his chin; syn. كَوْسَجٌ: (S,<br>\
Mgh, K:) or having a scanty beard: (IDrd:)<br>\
or the former signifies having little hair in the<br>\
beard, and in the eyebrows: (K:) or [when you<br>\
mean the latter] you say رَجُلٌ ثَطُّ الحَاجِبَيْنِ, (K,)<br>\
a man having thin, or scanty, eyebrows; as also<br>\
الحَاجِبَيْنِ ↓ أَثَطُّ; (TA;) the mention of the eyebrows being indispensable; (IAar, K;) and اِمْرَأَةٌ<br>\
ثَطَّةُ الحَاجِبَيْنِ [a woman having thin, or scanty,<br>\
eyebrows]: (S TA:) pl. (of pauc., TA) أَثْطَاطٌ<br>\
(Kr, K) and (of mult., TA) ثُطَّانٌ and ثِطَطَةٌ<br>\
(AZ, K) and ثُطُطٌ, (IAar,) [all of which may be<br>\
of either sing.,] and ثِطَاطٌ, (AZ, S, K,) which is<br>\
of the former sing., (S,) and ثُطٌّ, (AZ, S, K,)<br>\
which is of the latter. (S.) You say also اِمْرَأَةٌ<br>\
↓ ثَطَّآءُ A woman having no إِسْب, (Lth, TA,) i. e.<br>\
hair on the pubes; in the copies of the K incorrectly written اِسْت. (TA.) And ↓ عَارِضٌ أَثَطُّ A<br>\
side of the cheek, or of the face, having the hair<br>\
falling off. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, the former, Heavy<br>\
in the belly; (K, TA;) slow; applied to a man.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  The former also signifies Human excrement or ordure; or thin human excrement or<br>\
ordure; syn. سَلْحٌ. (Sgh, K.) [See also ثَلْطٌ.]<br>\
أَثَطُّ, and its fem. ثَطَّآءُ: see ثَطٌّ, in four places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  الثَّطَّآءُ also signifies The spider: or another<br>\
creeping thing, that stings, or bites, vehemently:<br>\
(K:) this is from Lth, as in the O and L: but<br>\
in the Tekmileh we find الثَّطَّآءُ, like شَفَّآء, [app. a<br>\
mistake for الثِّطَآءُ, like شِفَآء,] a certain small<br>\
creeping thing: or, as some say, it is الثَّطَا, of the<br>\
measure of قَفًا. (TA.)<br>\
