kind of بَقْل, (AHn, M,) well known, (S,) abundant in the country of the Arabs; (AHn, M;)<br>\
of two sorts; wild, (AHn, M, K,) and growing<br>\
in the cultivated tracts, (AHn, M,) or in gardens:<br>\
(K:) the former sort is called ثُومُ الحَيَّةِ, and is<br>\
the stronger, (K,) and is brought from Syria:<br>\
(TA:) each of them is heating, expels flatulence<br>\
and worms, and is strongly diuretic; and this is<br>\
the most excellent [property] that is therein: it<br>\
is good for obliviousness, and asthma, and chronic<br>\
cough, and [pain in] the spleen and the flank,<br>\
and colic, and sciatica, &amp;c.: (K: [in which are<br>\
added many other supposed uses:]) n. un. with ة.<br>\

(M,) ثُومَةٌ signifies also (tropical:) The pommel of a sword.<br>\
(S, M, K.) Whence, أُمُّ ثُوْمَةَ, said to be the name<br>\
of a certain woman, may mean (tropical:) A sword. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, also,] ثُوْمَةُ ذَكَرِ رَجُلٍ (assumed tropical:)  [The glans of<br>\
a man&#39;s penis]. (Az, in TA voce طُرْثُوثٌ.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
الثُّومَةُ also signifies The channel [or oblong depression] between the two mustaches, against the<br>\
partition between the two nostrils; (IAar, TA;)<br>\
i. q. الخُنْعُبَةُ, &amp;c. (TA in art. خنعب.)<br>\
-A2-  ثُومٌ is<br>\
also a dial. var. of فُومٌ, meaning Wheat. (Lh,<br>\
T, M.) And the latter is used in the [ordinary]<br>\
sense of the former. (T.)<br>\
