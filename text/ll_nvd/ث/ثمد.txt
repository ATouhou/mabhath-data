ثَمَدٌ (T, S, M, A, K) and ↓ ثَمْدٌ (S, M, K) and<br>\
↓ ثِمَادٌ, (M, K,) or the last is a pl. of one of the<br>\
two preceding words, (MF,) Water that is little<br>\
in quantity, (Lth, T, S, M, K,) that has no continual increase: (S, M, A, K:) or a little water<br>\
remaining in a tract of hard, or hard and level,<br>\
ground: or what appears in winter and goes<br>\
away in summer (الصَّيْف): (M, K:) or a small<br>\
round hollow or cavity (قَلْت) in which the rainwater collects and from which men drink during<br>\
two months of the spring-season (الصَّيْف), but<br>\
which fails when the summer (القَيْظ) comes:<br>\
(IAar, T:) and rain-water that remains retained<br>\
beneath the sand, and, when this is removed, is<br>\
yielded by the ground: (A:) pl. ثِمَادٌ (T, A) and<br>\
أَثْمَادٌ [a pl. of pauc.]: (so in the L:) some say<br>\
that ثِمَادٌ signifies holes dug or excavated, in<br>\
which is a little water; and hence A&#39;Obeyd says,<br>\
سُجِرَتِ الثِّمَادُ, meaning that the holes &amp;c. were<br>\
filled by the rain; but he does not explain it:<br>\
(M:) or ثِمَادٌ signifies wells dug around a place<br>\
which has been prepared to receive the water of<br>\
the rain, where there is continually rain-water,<br>\
this place having water-courses, and the said wells<br>\
being filled therefrom: men drink the water that<br>\
lies open to view until it becomes dried up by<br>\
the effect of the hot winds of summer; the wells<br>\
remaining. (Aboo-Málik, T.)<br>\
ثِمَادٌ: see ثَمَدٌ.<br>\
ثَامِدٌ A lamb or kid or calf that has begun to<br>\
eat. (S.)<br>\
إِثْمِدٌ [An ore of antimony: or antimony itself;<br>\
stibium; or stimmi:] collyrium-stone (حَجَرُ<br>\
الكُحْلِ), (K, TA,) which is black inclining to red,<br>\
the mines whereof are in Ispahán, whence the<br>\
best is obtained, and in the West, whence the<br>\
hardest is obtained: (TA:) a certain stone used<br>\
as a collyrium: (S:) a certain stone from which<br>\
collyrium (كُحْل) is prepared: or collyrium<br>\
(كُحْل) itself: (M:) or a substance resembling<br>\
it: (Seer, M:) or a species thereof: (Lth, T:) or<br>\
black كُحْل, the mine whereof is in the East:<br>\
said by some of the lawyers to be that of Ispahán:<br>\
and said to be an arabicized word. (Msb.) The<br>\
women of the Arabs used also to sprinkle [or<br>\
rub] it upon the lips and gums, in order that<br>\
the teeth might glisten the more. (EM p. 62.)<br>\
[And for the same purpose, many of them tattoo<br>\
their lips, so as to make them of a uniform<br>\
dull bluish hue.] ―<br>\
-b2-  One says of a man who<br>\
remains awake at night, journeying or working,<br>\
فُلَانٌ يَجْعَلُ اللَّيْلَ إِثْمِدًا [Such a one makes the<br>\
night a collyrium]; the blackness of the night<br>\
being as though it were a collyrium to his eyes<br>\
because he labours all the night in seeking the<br>\
means of attaining to eminence. (AA, T, L.)<br>\
