and pl. pl. pl. (i. e. pl. of ثُمُرٌ, S, Msb) أَثْمَارٌ;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) and the pl. of أَثْمَارٌ is أَثَامِيرُ;<br>\
(IHsh, TA:) or ثُمُرٌ is pl. of ثَمَرٌ; (AHeyth,<br>\
TA;) or it may be pl. of ثَمَرَةٌ, because it is of a<br>\
form more common as that of a pl. of a word of<br>\
this form than of the form of ثِمَارٌ: (M:) ثَمَرَةٌ is<br>\
the n. un. of ثَمَرٌ, (S, M, K,) and ثَمُرَةٌ is that<br>\
of ثَمُرٌ: (Sb, M, K: *) the pl. of ثَمَرَةٌ is ثَمَرَاتٌ<br>\
(S, Msb) and ↓ ثَمْرَآءُ: (K:) [or rather this last<br>\
is a quasi-pl. n.:] ثَمُرَةٌ, which none but Sb mentions, has, accord. to him, no broken pl.: (M:)<br>\
IHsh says that there is no word like ثَمَرٌ in its<br>\
series of pls. except أَكَمٌ. (MF: see أَكَمَةٌ.) ―<br>\

(S,) and ↓ ثَمَارٌ, (K,) or ↓ ثِيمَارٌ, (M,) or ↓ ثَيْمَارٌ;<br>\
(TA;) of which last three, the first (ثمار) is disapproved by several writers; and some say that<br>\
it is for ثَمَرٌ, the second vowel being lengthened<br>\
for the sake of metre; (MF;) (tropical:)  Property, or<br>\
wealth, (T, S,) increased and multiplied: (S:) or<br>\
various kinds of property or wealth, (I&#39;Ab, M,<br>\
K,) increased and multiplied, and gained, or acquired, for oneself: (I&#39;Ab, B:) or, accord. to<br>\
Mujáhid, ثَمَرٌ, in the Kur, means fruit; and ↓ ثَمُرٌ,<br>\
property, or wealth; but Yoo did not admit this,<br>\
app. holding both to mean the same: (T:) in<br>\
the Kur xviii. 32, AA read ↓ ثُمْرٌ, and explained<br>\
it as signifying kinds of property or wealth. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  ثَمَرٌ also signifies (tropical:)  Gold and silver: (AAF,<br>\
M, K:) so accord. to Mujáhid in the Kur xviii. 32;<br>\
but this is not known in the proper language.<br>\

fruit of the heart]: accord. to some, in the Kur<br>\
ii. 150, الثَّمَرَات means الأَوْلَاد [or children] and<br>\
الأَحْفَاد [or grandchildren, &amp;c.]. (B, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Progeny; or offspring. (K.) [Whence, app.,]<br>\
قُطِعَتْ ثَمَرَتُهُ (assumed tropical:)  His [power of] procreating was<br>\
cut off: or his appetite for sexual intercourse.<br>\
(TA from a trad.) [Another meaning of this<br>\

meaning the profit, of a thing: (Msb, TA:) as<br>\

increase of property. (A.) ―<br>\

(A, K;) because like a fruit in its form and in its<br>\
manner of hanging: (B, TA:) and ثَمَرٌ, the knots<br>\
of the extremities of whips: (S, Mj, Mgh:) or the<br>\
former signifies the end, or extremity, of a whip:<br>\

its عَذَبَة. (Mgh.) ―<br>\

extremity. (IAth, TA.) ―<br>\

pl. ثِمَارٌ: so in the phrases قُطِعَتْ ثَمَرَةُ فُلَانٍ, and<br>\
قُطِعَتْ ثِمَارُهُمْ, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one was circumcised, and they were circumcised. (A.) [Another<br>\
meaning of the former of these phrases has been<br>\
mentioned above.] ―<br>\
-b11-  (assumed tropical:)  The skin of the head.<br>\

[Hence,] خَصَّنِى بِثَمَرَةِ قَلْبِهِ (tropical:)  [He distinguished<br>\
me peculiarly, or specially,] by his love, or affection. (A, TA.) And أَعْطَاهُ صَفْقَةَ يَدِهِ وَثَمَرَةَ قَلْبِهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [He gave him his ratification of the bargain,<br>\
and] his sincerest agreement. (A, TA.) ―<br>\

-b3-  مَا نَفْسِى لَكَ بِثَمِرَةٍ<br>\

but accord. to Z, in the A, art. تمر, the last word<br>\
in this phrase is with ت, and so it is written in<br>\
the K in that art., and explained as meaning طَيِّبَةٌ<br>\
[or agreeably affected]. (TA.)<br>\
ثَمْرَآءُ: see ثَمَرٌ, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-  شَجَرَةٌ ثَمْرَآءُ A<br>\
tree having fruit; (S;) of which the fruit has<br>\
come forth: (K:) or abounding with fruit; as<br>\
also ↓ ثَمِيرَةٌ: or this latter signifies the same as<br>\
↓ مُثْمِرَةٌ; and its pl. is ثُمُرٌ. (AHn, M.) And<br>\
أَرْضٌ ثَمْرَآءُ Land abounding with fruit; as also<br>\
↓ ثَمِيرَةٌ, (AHn, M, K,) or ↓ ثَمِرَةٌ. (So in some<br>\
copies of the K, and in the TA.)<br>\
ثَمَارٌ: see ثَمَرٌ, second sentence.<br>\
ثَمِيرٌ; fem. with ة: hence شَجَرَةٌ ثَمِيرَةٌ, and أَرْضٌ<br>\
