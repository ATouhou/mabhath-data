roused. (Th, T.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  He returned to a<br>\

he became convalescent, and fat, after leanness.<br>\
(Mgh.) And ثاب جِسْمُهُ, (M, A, K,) inf. n.<br>\
ثَوَبَانٌ; (M, K;) and جِسْمُهُ ↓ اثاب; (IKt, M;)<br>\
and ثاب إِلَيْهِ جِسْمُهُ; (T, M, A;) and ↓ اثاب,<br>\
alone; (S, M, A;) (tropical:)  He became fat, after leanness; (A;) his good state of body returned to<br>\
him; (S, M, K; *) his condition of body became<br>\

its former state after some had been drawn:<br>\
(M:) the water collected [again] in a wateringtrough, or tank. (S.) ―<br>\

collected themselves together, and came. (S.)<br>\
And ثاب القَوْمُ (assumed tropical:)  The company of men came<br>\

said of a man&#39;s property, (tropical:)  It became abundant,<br>\
and collected. (A.) ―<br>\
-b9-  Said of dust, (tropical:)  It rose, or<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  ثوَب بَعْدَ خَصَاصَةٍ (tropical:)  [He returned to a state of<br>\

تَثْوِيبٌ meaning The calling, or summoning,<br>\
(M, Mgh, K,) to prayer, (M, K,) and to other<br>\
things, (M,) is said to be from ثَوْبٌ “ a garment,”<br>\
(Mgh,) because a man, when he comes crying<br>\
out for aid, makes a sign with his garment, (M,<br>\
Mgh,) moving it about, raising his hand with it,<br>\
in order that he to whom he calls may see it,<br>\
(Mgh,) and this action is like a calling, or summoning, (M, Mgh,) and an announcing, to him;<br>\
so the calling, or summoning, by reason to frequent usage of this word [as meaning the making<br>\
a sign with a garment], came to be thus called;<br>\
and one said of the caller, or summoner, ثوَب:<br>\
(Mgh:) or it means the calling, or summoning,<br>\
twice; (M, K;) or the repeating a call or summons; from ثاب “ he returned: ” (Mgh:) you<br>\
say, ثوّب, inf. n. as above, (T, Msb,) meaning<br>\
he called, or summoned, one time after another;<br>\
(T;) he repeated his call, or cry: (Msb:) and<br>\
hence تثويب in the أَذَان; (T, Msb;) i. e., the<br>\
saying of the مُؤَذِّن, after having, by the اذان,<br>\
called the people to prayer, الصَّلَاهْ رَحِمَكُمُ اللّٰهُ<br>\
الصَّلَاهْ [Prayer: may God have mercy on you!<br>\
Prayer!]; thus calling to it a second time: (T:)<br>\
or his saying, (S, TA,) in the morning call to<br>\
prayer, (S,) الصَّلَاةُ خَيْرٌ مِنَ النَّوْمٌ [Prayer is<br>\
better than sleep]; (S, TA;) for he resumes his<br>\
call by saying this after he has said, حَىَّ عَلَى<br>\
الصَّلَاهْ [and حَىَّ عَلَى الفَلَاحٌ]; desiring the people<br>\
to hasten to prayer: (TA:) or his saying, in the<br>\
morning call to prayer, الصلاة خيرمن النوم<br>\
twice, (T, K,) after having said, حَىّ علي الصلاه<br>\
حىّ علي الفلاح: (T:) or the old تثويب was<br>\
the saying of the مُؤَذِّن, in the morning call to<br>\
prayer, الصلاة خير من النوم: and the modern,<br>\
الصَّلَاهْ الصَّلَاهْ; or قَامَتْ قَامَتْ. (Mgh.) It also<br>\
signifies The إِقَامَة; (Mgh, K, TA;) [meaning, the chanting, by the مُبَلِّغُون, in a mosque,<br>\
not by the مُؤَذِّن, the common words of the أَذَان,<br>\
with the addition of قَدْ قَامَتِ الصَّلَاهْ (The time of<br>\
prayer has come), pronounced twice after حىّ<br>\
على الفلاح;] i. e. the اقامة of prayer: (IAth,<br>\
TA:) and this is what is meant by the phrase, in<br>\
a trad., إِذَا ثُوِّبَ بِالصَّلَاةِ [When the words of the<br>\
اقامة are chanted]. (IAth, Mgh, TA.) And The<br>\
praying after the prayer divinely ordained. (Yoo,<br>\
T, K.) You say, ثوّب, meaning He performed a<br>\
supererogatory prayer after the prescribed; تثويب<br>\
being only after the prescribed; being the praying after praying: (T:) and ↓ تثوّب signifies<br>\
the same. (K.) And ثّوب بِرَكْعَتَيْنِ He performed two rek&#39;ahs as a supererogatory act.<br>\
(A.) But this and the similar significations are<br>\
said to be post-classical. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 4, in<br>\
four places.<br>\
-A2-  ثَيَّبَتْ, (T, S, Mgh,) inf. n. تَثْيِيبٌ;<br>\
(T, Mgh;) formed from ثَيِّبٌ, upon supposition<br>\
[that the medial radical letter of this word is ى,<br>\
whereas many hold that letter to be و]; (Mgh;)<br>\
or ↓ تَثَيَّبَتْ; (K in art. ثيب; [the author of<br>\
which seems to have supposed that, for ثَيَّبَتْ, one<br>\
should read ثُيِّبَتْ; and therefore he gives مُثَيَّبٌ<br>\
as syn. with ثَيِّبٌ;]) She (a woman) became what<br>\
is termed ثَيِّب. (T, Mgh, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Accord. to<br>\
my copy of the Mgh, it also signifies She (a<br>\
camel) became what is termed نَاب: but I think<br>\
that, in this instance, it is a mistranscription, for<br>\
نَيَّبَتْ.]<br>\
-A3-  [See also the last sentence of the<br>\
second paragraph of art. ثرب; and compare, with<br>\
what is there said by SM, meanings assigned<br>\
below to مَثَابٌ and مَثَابَةٌ.]<br>\

(T, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اثابهُ اللّٰهُ, (T, S, * M, A, Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
إِثَابَةٌ; (Mgh;) and أَثْوَبَهُ [dev. from rule]; (M,<br>\
K;) and ↓ ثوّبهُ, (T, A,) inf. n. تثْوِيبٌ; (T, Mgh;)<br>\
God recompensed, compensated, requited, or rewarded, him: (T, S, * M, A, Mgh, * Msb, K:) said<br>\
in relation to good and to evil. (T.) And اثابهُ,<br>\
(Lh, M,) and أَثْوَبَهُ, (T,) مَثُوبَةً حَسَنَةً, (Lh, T,<br>\
M,) and مَثْوَبَةً, (Lh, M,) He (God) gave him<br>\
a good recompense, compensation, &amp;c. (M.) And<br>\
مَثُوبَتَهُ ↓ ثوّبهُ He gave him his recompense, &amp;c.<br>\
(M, K.) It is said in a trad., أَثِيبُوا أَخَاكُمْ, i. e.<br>\
Recompense ye your brother for his good deed.<br>\
(TA.) And in the Kur [lxxxiii. last verse], هَلْ<br>\
الكُفَّارُ مَا كَانُوا يَفْعَلُونَ ↓ ثُوِّبَ Have the unbelievers<br>\
been recompensed for what they did? (T, S, M.)<br>\
And one says also, اثابهُ مِنْ هِبَتِهِ, meaning He<br>\
gave him a substitute, something instead or in<br>\
exchange, or a compensation, for his gift. (Mgh, *<br>\
and TA in art. جنب.) And مِنْ كَذَا ↓ ثوّبهُ, (M,)<br>\

&amp;c., for such a thing. (M, K. *) ―<br>\
-b4-  اثاب الثَّوْبَ,<br>\

cloth, the second time: when one sews it the first<br>\

‘ running ’ ”]. (T.) ―<br>\

part of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b3-  The former also signifies<br>\
He gained, or earned, a ثَوَاب [or recompense,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (K.) But this is said to be post-classical.<br>\
(MF.)<br>\
6<br>\
تثاوب: see ثُئِبَ, in art. ثأب.<br>\
10<br>\
استثاب مَالًا He restored to himself, or<br>\
repossessed himself of, property; syn. اِسْتَرْجَعَهُ;<br>\
(T, A, K;) his property having gone away. (T,<br>\
A.) And اِسْتَثَبْتُ بِمَالِكَ I restored to myself, or<br>\
repossessed myself of, property, by means of that<br>\
which thou gavest me; my property having gone<br>\
away. (A.) El-Kumeyt says,<br>\
إِنَّ العَشِيرَةَ تَسْتَثِيبُ بِمَالِهِ<br>\
فَيُغِيرُ وَهْوَ مُوَفِّرٌ أَمْوَالَهَا<br>\
[Verily the tribe restore to themselves wealth by<br>\
means of his property; and he makes incursions<br>\
into hostile territories at his own expense, making<br>\
their property abundant by the spoil that they<br>\
gain with him]. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  استثابهُ He asked<br>\
him to recompense, compensate, requite, or reward,<br>\

ثَوْبٌ A garment, (M, Mgh, Msb, K,) [or piece<br>\
of cloth or stuff,] that is worn by men, composed<br>\
of linen, cotton, wool, fur, خَزّ [q. v.], (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) silk, or the like; (Msb;) but [properly]<br>\
not what is cut out of several pieces, such as the<br>\
shirt, and trousers, or drawers, &amp;c.; (Mgh;)<br>\
[though often applied to a shirt or shift (قَمِيص or<br>\
دِرْع) and to a جُبَّة &amp;c.:] it seems to be so called<br>\
because the wearer returns to it, or it to the<br>\
wearer, time after time: (Mgh:) [also a garment<br>\
worn by women and girls over the shift; (see<br>\
أُصْدَةٌ;) app., as in the present day, a long gown,<br>\
reaching to the feet, with very wide sleeves:] pl.<br>\
ثِيَابٌ [the pl. of mult.] (T, S, M, A, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K) and أَثْوَابٌ [a pl. of pauc.] (S, M, Msb, K)<br>\
and أَثْوُبٌ and أَثْؤُبٌ, (S, M, K,) the last two being<br>\
pls. of pauc., and the latter of them being thus<br>\
pronounced with ء by some of the Arabs because<br>\
the dammeh immediately after و is deemed difficult of utterance; for which reason they substitute<br>\
ء for و in all instances like this. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Curtains,<br>\
and the like, are not [properly] called ثِيَاب; but<br>\
أَمْتِعَةُ البَيْتِ: (Mgh, Msb:) though Es-Sarakhsee<br>\
uses the phrase ثِيَابُ البَيْتِ. (Mgh.) تَعَلَّقَ بِثِيَابِ<br>\
اللّٰهِ (tropical:)  [He clung to the curtains of the House of<br>\
God], i. e., to the curtains of the Kaabeh, is a<br>\
tropical expression. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Sometimes, ثَوْبٌ is<br>\
used metonymically to signify (tropical:)  A thing [of any<br>\
kind] that veils, covers, or protects: as in the<br>\
saying of a poet,<br>\
كَثَوْبِ ابْنِ بِيضٍ وَقَاهُمْ بِهِ<br>\
فَسَدَّ عَلَى السَّالِكِينَ السَّبِيلَا<br>\
[Like the means of protection adopted by Ibn-Beed: he protected them by it, and closed the<br>\
way against the passengers]. (TA.) Ibn-Beed<br>\
was a wealthy merchant of the tribe of &#39;Ád, who<br>\
hamstrung his she-camel upon a mountain-road,<br>\
and stopped the way [to his abode] with it. (K<br>\
in art. بيض.) ―<br>\
-b4-  In the same manner, also, ثِيَابٌ<br>\
is used to signify (tropical:)  Weapons. (Ham p. 63.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And أَثْوَابٌ is sometimes employed to signify (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
wearers of garments; the wearers&#39; bodies. (R,<br>\
TA.) Esh-Shemmákh says, (T,) or Leylà, describing camels, (TA,)<br>\
وَمَوْهَا بِأَثْوَابٍ خِفَافٍ فَلَا تَرَى<br>\
لَهَا  شَبَهًا إِلَّا النَّعَامَ المُنَفَّرَا<br>\
i. e. They mounted them, namely, the travellingcamels, (T,) with their [light, or agile,] bodies:<br>\
[and thou seest not anything like them, except<br>\
ostriches scared away.] (T, TA.) And in like<br>\
manner, also, the dual is employed to signify<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The wearer&#39;s body, or self; or what the garments infold: and ثِيَاب is employed in the same<br>\
manner. (TA.) You say, لِلّهِ ثَوْبَاهُ, i. e. (tropical:)  To God<br>\
be he [meaning his excellence] attributed! [for<br>\
nothing but what is excellent is to be attributed<br>\
to God:] (A:) or it means لِلّهِ دَرُّهُ [To God be<br>\
attributed the good that hath proceeded from<br>\
him! or his good deed! &amp;c.: see arts. اله and در].<br>\
(K.) And فِى ثَوْبَىْ أَبِى أَنْ أَفِيَهُ meaning (tropical:)  [On<br>\
me and on my father it rests, or lies, or be it, that<br>\
I pay it: or] فِىذِمَّتِى وَذِمَّةِأَبِى [on my responsibility and the responsibility of my father]. (K,<br>\
TA.) And اُسْلُلْ ثِيَابَكَ مِنْ ثِيَابِى (tropical:)  Withdraw, or<br>\
separate, thyself from me. (A.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [The following<br>\
exs. are mostly, or all, tropical.] ―<br>\
-b7-  إِنِّ المَيِّتَ<br>\
لَيُبْعَثُ فِى ثِيَابِهِ الَّتِى يَمُوتُ فِيهَا, (K, * TA,) a<br>\
saying of Mohammad, repeated by Aboo-Sa&#39;eed<br>\
El-Khudree, when, being about to die, he had<br>\
called for new garments, and put them on:<br>\
(TA:) it means Verily the dead will be raised in<br>\
his garments in which he dies; accord. to some;<br>\
and was used in this sense by Aboo-Sa&#39;eed: (ElKhattábee, MF, TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  [agreeably with] his<br>\
works (K, TA) with which his life is closed:<br>\
(TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  in the state in which he dies, according as it is good or evil. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ,<br>\
in the Kur [lxxiv. 4], means And purify thy<br>\
garments: (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, T:) or shorten thy<br>\
garments; for the shortening them is a means of<br>\
purity: (T:) or (assumed tropical:)  put not on thy garments in a<br>\
state of disobedience or unrighteousness: (I&#39;Ab,<br>\
T:) or (assumed tropical:)  be not perfidious; for [figuratively<br>\
speaking,] he who is so pollutes his garments:<br>\
(Fr, T:) or, as some say, (assumed tropical:)  purify thy heart:<br>\
(Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, T, K:) or (assumed tropical:)  purify thyself (IKt,<br>\
T, TA) from sins, or offences: (IKt, TA:) or<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  rectify thine actions, or thy conduct. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
You say, فُلَانْ نَقِىُّ الثَّوْبِ, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one<br>\
is free from vice, or fault: (A:) and طَاهِرُ الثَّوْبِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [the same; or pure in heart, or conduct, or<br>\
reputation]. (TA in art. نصح.) And دَنِسُ الثِّيَابِ<br>\
(tropical:)  Vicious, or faulty: (A:) or perfidious: (Fr,<br>\
T:) or foul, or evil, in reputation, (T, TA,) in<br>\
conduct, or actions, and in the way that he follows<br>\
[with respect to religion and morality]. (TA.)<br>\

-b12-  ثَوْبُ المَآءِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The membrane called] السَّلَى and الغِرْسُ. (K.<br>\
See these two words.)<br>\
ثِيبٌ: see ثَائِبٌ, in two places.<br>\
ثُبَةٌ The place where the water collects in a<br>\
valley or low ground; so called because the water<br>\
returns to it: (Aboo-Kheyreh, T:) and the middle<br>\
of a watering-trough or tank, (T, S, M,) to which<br>\
the water returns when it has been emptied, (S,)<br>\
or to which what remains of the water returns;<br>\
(T;) as also ↓ مَثَابٌ: (S:) the ة is a substitute<br>\
for the و, the medial radical, which is suppressed;<br>\
(S, L;) the word being from ثَابَ, aor. يَثُوبُ:<br>\
(L:) Aboo-Is-hák infers that this is the case from<br>\
its having for its dim. ↓ ثُوَيْبَةٌ: but it may be<br>\
from ثَبَّيْتُ “ I collected together: ” (M:) it is<br>\
mentioned in the K in art. ثبى or ثبو, and not<br>\
here. (TA.) See also art. ثبو or ثبى. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
A company of men; (T, M, L;) and so أُثْبِيَّةٌ:<br>\
(M:) or a company of men in a state of separation or dispersion; (T;) a distinct body, or company, of people: (Yoo, T:) and a troop of<br>\
horsemen: (M:) pl. ثُبَاتٌ and ثُبُونَ (T, M) and<br>\
ثِبُونَ: (S and M in art. ثبى, and M in art. ثبو<br>\
also:) accord. to some, from ثَابَ, being originally ثُوبَةٌ; and its dim. is ↓ ثُوَيْبَةٌ: accord. to<br>\
others, it is originally ثُبْيَةٌ; (T, L;) and its pl.<br>\
is ثُبًى. (L.) Hence, in the Kur [iv. 73], فَانْفِرُوا<br>\
ثُبَاتٍ, i. e. [And go ye forth to to war against the<br>\
unbelievers] in troops, (Fr, T,) or in distinct<br>\
bodies. (Yoo, T.) See, again, art. ثبو or ثبى.<br>\

Msb) and ↓ مَثُوبَةٌ (T, S, M, K) and ↓ مَثْوَبَةٌ, (EtTemeemee, T, M, K,) the last anomalous, (M,)<br>\
and unknown to the Kilábees, who knew the<br>\
second of these words, (T,) A recompense, compensation, requital, or reward, (T, S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) of obedience [to God]: (S:) or absolutely; for good and for evil; as appears from<br>\
the words of the Kur, هَلْ ثُوِّبَ الكُفَّارُ [cited above,<br>\
see 4]; but more especially and frequently, for<br>\
good. (IAth, L, MF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ثَوَابٌ is also used<br>\
as a quasi-inf. n., in the sense of إِثَابَةٌ; and in<br>\
this case, accord to the Koofees and Baghdádees,<br>\
it may govern as a verb, [like the inf. n.,] as in<br>\
the saying,<br>\
لِإَنَّ ثَوَابَ اللّهِ كُلَّ مُوَحِّدٍ<br>\
جِنَانٌ مِنَ الفِرْدَوْسِ فِيهَا يُخَلَّدُ<br>\
[For God&#39;s rewarding every believer in his unity<br>\
will be the giving gardens of Paradise, wherein<br>\
he will be made to abide for ever]. (Expos. of<br>\
the Shudhoor edh-Dhahab.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It signifies also<br>\
(tropical:)  Honey; (K, TA;) i. e. (TA) the good that<br>\
proceeds from bees. (A, TA.) ―<br>\

(Msb;) A woman who has become separated<br>\
from her husband (Lth, T, M, Mgh, K) in any<br>\
manner: (Lth, T, M, Mgh:) or a woman whose<br>\
husband has died, or who has been divorced, and<br>\
has then returned to the marriage-state: (AHeyth,<br>\
TA:) or one that is not a virgin: (IAth, TA:)<br>\
or a woman to whom a man has gone in; and a<br>\
man who has gone in to a woman: (Ks, ISk, S,<br>\
Mgh, K:) or a person who has married: (Msb:)<br>\
applied to a man and to a woman; (As, S, M,<br>\
Msb;) like بِكْرٌ and أَيِّمٌ: (Mgh, Msb:) from ثَابَ;<br>\
(IAth, Mgh, Msb;) because they generally return<br>\
time after time to the marriage-state: (Mgh:)<br>\
but mostly applied to a woman; because she<br>\
returns to her family in a manner different from<br>\
the first [state]; (Msb;) or because the suitors<br>\
return to her time after time: (Mgh:) or it is<br>\
not applied to a man (Lth, El-&#39;Eyn, T, M, Mgh,<br>\
K) except in the dual form, as when one says<br>\
وَلَدُ الثَّيِّبَيْنِ: (Lth, El-&#39;Eyn, T, M, K:) and a<br>\
woman is also termed ↓ مُثَيِّبٌ; (M;) or ↓ مُثَيَّبٌ,<br>\
like مُعَظَمٌ: (K: [but see 2, last sentence but<br>\
two:]) the pl. of ثَيِبٌ applied to a woman is<br>\
ثَيِّبَاتٌ, (T, Mgh, Msb,) and the post-classical<br>\
writers say ثُيَّبٌ, which has not been heard as<br>\
genuine Arabic: (Mgh, * Msb:) its pl. if applied<br>\
to a man is ثُيِّبُونَ. (Msb.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
الثَّيِّبَانِ يُرْجَمَانِ وَالبِكْرَانِ يُجْلَدَانِ وَيُغَرَّبَانِ [The<br>\
two persons of whom each has previously had<br>\
carnal intercourse in marriage with one of the<br>\
other sex shall be stoned if they commit adultery<br>\
together; and the two who have previously had<br>\
no connubial intercourse with others shall be<br>\
flogged and banished if they commit fornication<br>\
together]. (T.) ―<br>\

proper signification. (IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  This word<br>\
is mentioned in the K [and M] in art. ثيب; and<br>\
its mention in art. ثوب is said by the author of<br>\
the K to be wrong: but IAth and many others<br>\
decisively assert that it is from ثَابَ, aor. يَثُوبُ,<br>\
“ he returned. ” (MF, TA.)<br>\
ثُوَيْبَةٌ: see ثُبَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
ثِيابَةٌ and ثُيُوبَةٌ, as meaning The state of being<br>\
a ثَيِّب, are not of the genuine language of the<br>\
Arabs. (Mgh.)<br>\

bath. (K.) [A post-classical word.]<br>\

وعيب is an epithet]: (T, L, TA:) or the first<br>\
of these three phrases means a well of which the<br>\
water stops sometimes, and then returns. (Ham<br>\

(T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ثَائِبُ البَحْرِ (assumed tropical:)  The water of the sea when<br>\

reads thus [in the Kur]. (TA.) It has the first<br>\
of all these meanings in the Kur ii. 119: (T, S,<br>\
Bd, Jel, TA:) or it there means a place of recompense or reward for the pilgrimage to the Kaabeh<br>\

rarely that a word of the measure مَفَعَلَةٌ [like<br>\
مثابة] is an inf. n. (M.) [See مَثَابٌ: and see<br>\
