ثَنَاهُ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) said in the<br>\
K to be like سَعَى, implying that the aor. is<br>\
ثَنَىَ,<br>\
but this is a mistake, (MF, TA,) [for it is well<br>\
known that] the aor. is<br>\
ثَنِىَ, (Msb,) inf. n. ثَنْىٌ, (S,<br>\
M, Msb, &amp;c.,) He doubled it, or folded it; (T;)<br>\
he turned one part of it upon another; (M, K;)<br>\
he bent it; (T, S, Mgh, Msb, TA;) he drew, or<br>\
contracted, one of its two extremities to [or towards] the other; or joined, or adjoined, one of<br>\
them to the other; thus bending it; (Mgh;)<br>\
namely, a stick, or branch, or twig, (Mgh,) or a<br>\
thing, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) of any kind. (T.)<br>\
One says of a man with the mention of whom one<br>\
begins, in relation to an honourable or a praiseworthy quality, or in relation to science or knowledge, بِهِ تُثْنَى الخَنَاصِرُ, (T,) meaning With [the<br>\
mention of] him, (T, and Msb in art. خصر,)<br>\
among others of his class, (Msb ib.,) the little<br>\
fingers are bent. (T, and Msb ubi suprá. [For<br>\
the Arabs, in counting with the fingers, first bend<br>\
the tip of the little finger down to the palm of the<br>\
hand; then, the tip of the next; and so on;<br>\
bending the thumb down upon the other fingers<br>\
for five; and then continue by extending the fingers, one after another, again commencing with<br>\
the little finger.]) And a poet says,<br>\
فَإِنْ عُدَّ مَجْدٌ أَوْ قَدِيمٌ لِمَعْشَرٍ<br>\
فَقَوْمِى بِهِمْ تُثْنَى هُنَاكَ لأَصَابِعُ<br>\
[And if glory, or any old ground of pretension to<br>\
honour, be reckoned as belonging to a body of<br>\
men, it is my people, with the mention of them,<br>\
in that case, the fingers are bent]; meaning that<br>\
they are reckoned as the best; (IAar, M;) for<br>\
the best are not many. (M.) One says also,<br>\
ثَنَى وَرِكَهُ فَنَزَلَ [lit. He bent his hip, and alighted],<br>\
meaning he alighted from his beast. (T.) And<br>\
ثَنَى رِجْلَهُ عَنْ دَابَّتِهِ, meaning He drew up his leg<br>\
to his thigh, and alighted. (M.) But قَبْلَ أَنْ<br>\
يَثْنِىَ رِجْلَهُ, occurring in a trad., means Before he<br>\
turned his leg from the position in which it was<br>\
in the pronouncing of the testimony of the faith.<br>\
(IAth.) ثَنَى صَدْرَهُ, aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
[lit. He folded his breast, or bosom,] means (assumed tropical:)  he<br>\
concealed enmity in his breast, or bosom: or he<br>\
folded up what was in it, in concealment. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in the Kur [xi. 5], أَلَا إِنَّهُمْ يَثْنَونَ صُدُورَهُمْ,<br>\
meaning [Now surely] they infold and conceal [in<br>\
their bosoms] enmity and hatred: (Fr, T:) or<br>\
they bend their breasts, or bosoms, and fold up,<br>\
and conceal, what is therein: (Zj, T:) I&#39;Ab<br>\
read, صُدُورُهُمْ ↓ تَثْنَوْنِى: you say, اِثْنَوْنَى صَدْرُهُ<br>\
عَلَى البَغْضَآءِ, meaning his breast, or bosom, infolded, or concealed, vehement hatred: (T:) or<br>\
the phrase in the Kur, accord. to the former<br>\
reading, means they bend, or turn, their breasts,<br>\
or bosoms, from the truth; they turn themselves<br>\
away therefrom: or they incline their breasts, or<br>\
bosoms, to unbelief, and enmity to the Prophet:<br>\
or they turn their backs: (Bd:) [for] ―<br>\
-b2-  ثَنَاهُ, (T,<br>\
S, Msb, TA,) aor. as above, (Msb,) and so the<br>\
inf. n., (T, Msb, TA,) also signifies He turned<br>\
him, or it, away or back. (T, S, Msb, TA.) Also<br>\
He turned him, or turned him away or back,<br>\
(Lth, T, S,) from the course that he desired to<br>\
pursue, (Lth, T,) or from the object of his want:<br>\
(S:) or you say, ثَنَاهُ عَنْ وَجْهِهِ, (Mgh,) and عَنْ<br>\
حَاجَتِهِ, (TA,) and عَنْ مُرَادِهِ, (Msb,) he turned<br>\
him, or turned him away or back, (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA,) from his course, (Mgh,) and from the object<br>\
of his want, (TA,) and from the object of his<br>\
desire. (Msb.) One says also, فُلَانٌ لَا يُثْنَى عَنْ قِرْنِهِ<br>\
وَلَا عَنْ وَجْهِهِ [Such a one will not be turned, or<br>\
turned away or back, from his antagonist, nor<br>\
from his course]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also He tied it; or<br>\
tied it in a knot or knots; or tied it firmly, fast,<br>\
or strongly. (TA.) You say, ثَنَيْتُ البَعِيرَ بِثِنَايَيْنِ,<br>\
meaning, accord. to As, as related by A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
I bound both the fore legs of the camel with two<br>\
bonds: but correctly, I bound the two fore legs of<br>\
the camel with the two ends of a rope; the last<br>\
word meaning a single rope: (T:) عَقَلْتُهُ بِثَنْيَيْنِ<br>\
means I bound one of his fore shanks to the arm<br>\
with two ties, or tyings. (T, M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  ثَنْىٌ [as<br>\
inf. n. of ثَنَى] also signifies The act of drawing,<br>\
or joining, or adjoining, one [thing] to another;<br>\
(Lth, T, Mgh;) and so ↓ تَثْنِيَةٌ [inf. n. of ثنّى].<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [As ثَلَثَهُمْ signifies “ he took the third<br>\
of their property,” and “ he made them, with<br>\
himself, three,” and other verbs of number are<br>\
used in similar senses, so] ثَنَاهُ signifies He took<br>\
the half of their property: or he drew, or adjoined, to him what became with him two: (TA:)<br>\
or ثَنَيْتُهُ, (S, Msb,) aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
(Msb,) signifies I became (S, Msb) to him, (S,)<br>\
or with him, (Msb,) a second; (S, Msb;) or I<br>\
was a second to him, or it: (Er-Rághib:) or one<br>\
should not say thus, but that AZ says, (M,) هُوَ<br>\
وَاحِدٌ فَاثْنِهِ (M, K [but in the latter, هٰذَا in the<br>\
place of هُوَ, and in the CK, ↓ فأَثْنِه,]) he is one,<br>\
and be thou a second to him. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  ثَنَى,<br>\
aor. as above, also signifies He made eleven to be<br>\
twelve. (T in art. ثلث.) ―<br>\
-b7-  ثَنَى الأَرْضَ, inf. n.<br>\
as above, He turned over the land, or ground,<br>\
twice for sowing, or cultivating: (Mgh, and A *<br>\
and TA * in art. ثلث:) and ↓ تَثْنِيَةٌ [inf. n. of<br>\
ثنّى] and ثُنُيَانٌ [app. another inf. n. of ثَنَى, and<br>\
app. correctly written ثُنْيَانٌ] are often used by<br>\
[the Imám] Mohammad in the sense of ثَنْىٌ: he<br>\
who explains تَثْنِيَةٌ as signifying the turning over<br>\
[the land, or ground,] for sowing, or cultivating,<br>\
after the harvest, or as signifying the restoring<br>\
land to its owner turned over for sowing, or cultivating, commits an inadvertence. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
فَاثْنِنِى, occurring in a poem of Kutheiyir &#39;Azzeh,<br>\
is explained as meaning Then give thou to me a<br>\
second time: (M, TA:) but this is strange: (TA:)<br>\
[ISd says,] I have not seen it in any other instance. (M.) ―<br>\
-b9-  لَا يَثْنِى وَلَا يَثْلِثُ, (a phrase<br>\
mentioned by IAar, M,) or وَلَا يُثَلِّثُ ↓ لَا يُثَنِّى,<br>\
or وَلَا يُثْلِثُ ↓ لَا يُثْنِى: see 1 in art. ثلث.<br>\
2<br>\
ثنّاهُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَثْنِيَةٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
He made it two; or called it two. (S, M, MS b,<br>\
K.) [Hence,] ثَنَّى means also He counted two;<br>\
whence the saying, فُلَانٌ يُثَنِّى وَلَا يُثَلِّثُ; see art.<br>\
ثلث: (A and TA in art. ثلث:) [and so, app.,<br>\
↓ اِثَّنَى; for] a poet says,<br>\
بَدَا بِأَبِى ثُمَّ اثَّنَى بِأَبِى أَبِى<br>\
[which seems plainly to mean He began with my<br>\
father; then counted two with the father of my<br>\
father]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [He dualized it, namely, a<br>\
word; made it to have a dual. ―<br>\
-b3-  He marked it<br>\
with two points, namely, a ت or a ى.] ―<br>\
-b4-  He<br>\
repeated it; iterated it. (Mgh.) See 1, in three<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b5-  ثنّى لِامْرَأَتِهِ, or عِنْدَهَا, He remained<br>\
two nights with his wife: and in like manner the<br>\
verb is used in relation to any saying or action.<br>\
(TA voce سَبَّعَ.) ―<br>\
-b6-  ثنّى بِالأَمْرِ He did the thing<br>\
immediately after another thing. (T.) ―<br>\
-b7-  تَثْنِيَةٌ<br>\
also signifies A man&#39;s requesting others [who are<br>\
playing with him at the game called المَيْسِر] to<br>\
return, for [a chance of] the stakes, his arrow,<br>\
when it has been successful, and he has been secure,<br>\
and has won. (Lh, M.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 4.<br>\
4<br>\
أَثْنَتْ, or ↓ اِثْتَنَتْ, She brought forth her<br>\
second offspring. (TA in art. بكر.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1,<br>\
in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  اثنى, (inf. n. إِثْنَآءٌ, TA,) He<br>\
shed his tooth called the ثَنِيَّة; (S, Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
he became what is termed ثُنِىّ; said of a camel<br>\
[&amp;c.]: (M, K:) he shed his رَوَاضِع [pl. of رَاضِعَة<br>\
which is the same, in this case, as ثَنِيَّة]; said of<br>\
a horse [&amp;c.]. (IAar, T.)<br>\
-A2-  اثنى عَلَيْهِ, (T, S, M,<br>\
Msb, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. إِثْنَآءٌ; (T;) and ↓ ثنّى, inf. n.<br>\
تَثْنِيَةٌ, accord. to the K, but this is a mistake for<br>\
↓ ثبّى, inf. n. تَثْبِيَةٌ; (TA;) He praised, eulogized, commended, or spoke well of, him: and he<br>\
dispraised, censured, discommended, or spoke ill<br>\
of, him: (T, * M, Msb, K:) the object is either<br>\
God or a man: (T:) or it has the former meaning only: (M, K;) or the former meaning is<br>\
the more common: (Msb:) accord. to IAar,<br>\
اثنى signifies he spoke, or said, well, or good;<br>\
and ill, or evil; and انثى, “he defamed,” or<br>\
“did so in the absence of the object;” and “he<br>\
disdained, scorned, shunned, disliked, or hated,” a<br>\
thing: (T:) and you say, اثنى عَلَيْهِ خَيْرًا [He<br>\
spoke, or said, well, or good, of him]; (S, and<br>\
TA from a trad.;) and شَرًّا [ill, or evil], also.<br>\
(TA from the same trad.) One says also, أَثْنَيْتُ<br>\
فِعْلَهُ [I praised his deed]; meaning عَلَى فِعْلِهِ;<br>\
or because أَثْنَى means مَدَحَ. (Ham p. 696.)<br>\
5<br>\
تثنّى: see 7. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He affected an inclining of his body, or a bending, or he inclined<br>\
his body, or bent, from side to side; syn. تَمَايَلَ:<br>\
(Har pp. 269 and 271:) and he walked with an<br>\
elegant and a proud and self-conceited gait, with<br>\
an affected inclining of the body from side to<br>\
side; or with a twisting of the back, and with<br>\
extended steps; syn. تَبَخْتَرَ. (Idem p. 271.) You<br>\
say, تثنّى فِى مِشْيَتِهِ (S, and Har p. 269) He<br>\
affected an inclining of his body, or a bending, or<br>\
he inclined his body, or bent, from side to side, in<br>\
his gait. (Har ib.) [And in like manner, and<br>\
more commonly, one says of a woman.]<br>\
7<br>\
انثنى, (T, S, M, K,) and ↓ تثنّى, and ↓ اِثَّنَى,<br>\
of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ, (M, K,) originally اِثْتَنَى,<br>\
(M,) and ↓ اِثْنَوْنَى, (T, S, K,) of the measure<br>\
اِفْعَوْعَلَ, (T, S,) It was, or became, doubled, or<br>\
folded; (T;) it had one part turned upon another; (M, K;) it was, or became, bent. (T, S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] انثنى signifies also He turned, or<br>\
turned away or back, (Har pp. 44 and 120,)<br>\
عَنْ أَمْرٍ from an affair, after having determined<br>\
to do it. (Lth in TA art. زمع.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِثْتَنَىَ see 7, and 4: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also 2.<br>\
10<br>\
استثناهُ He set it aside as excluded; or he<br>\
excluded it, or excepted it; مِنْ شَىْءٍ from a thing;<br>\
syn. حَاشَاهُ: (M:) or he set it aside, or apart, for<br>\
himself: and in the conventional language of the<br>\
grammarians, [he excepted it; i. e.] he excluded<br>\
it from the predicament in which another thing<br>\
was included, or in which other things were included: (Mgh:) الاِسْتِثْنَآءُ [in grammar] is the<br>\
turning away the agent from reaching the object<br>\
of the اِسْتِثْنَآء: (Msb:) in the case of an oath<br>\
[and the like], it means the saying إِنْ شَآءَ اللّٰهُ [If<br>\
God will]. (Mgh.) [See ثُنْيَا.]<br>\
12<br>\
اثنونى: see 7; and see also 1.<br>\
ثِنْىٌ A duplication, or doubling, of a thing:<br>\
(T, * S, Msb:) pl. أَثْنَآءٌ; (S, Msb;) or the sing.<br>\
may be ↓ ثَنًى. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A folding: so in the<br>\
saying, أَنْفَذْتُ كَذَا ثِنْىَ كِتَابِى, (S, TA,) or<br>\
فِى ثِنْىِ كِتَابِىِ (so in a copy of the S,) i. e.,<br>\
فِى طَيِّهِ [lit. I sent, or transmitted, such a thing<br>\
within the folding of my writing, or letter;<br>\
meaning infolded, or enclosed, in it; and included<br>\
in it]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A duplicature, or fold, of a<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth: (TA:) or what is<br>\
turned back of the extremities thereof: (T:) pl.<br>\
as above: whence, in a trad. of Aboo-Hureyreh,<br>\
كَانَ يَثْنِيهِ عَلَيْهِ أَثْنَآءً مِنْ سَعَتِهِ [He used to fold it<br>\
upon him in folds by reason of its width]; meaning the garment. (TA.) [Hence the saying,]<br>\
وَكَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى أَثْنَآءِ كَذَا, i. e., فى غُضُونِهِ [lit And<br>\
that was in the folds, meaning, in the midst, of<br>\
such a thing, or such an affair, or event]. (TA.)<br>\
And جَاؤُوا فِى أَثْنَآءِ الأَمْرِ They came in the midst<br>\
of the affair, or event. (Msb.) [And hence,<br>\
app.,] مَضَى ثِنْىٌ مِنَ اللَّيْل An hour, or a period,<br>\
or a short portion, of the night passed; (M, K; *)<br>\
syn. سَاعَةٌ, (Th, M, K,) or وَقْتٌ. (Lh, M, K.)<br>\
[See also what is said below respecting its pl. in<br>\
relation to a night.] ―<br>\
-b4-  Also sing. of أَثْنَآءٌ meaning<br>\
The parts of a thing that are laid together like<br>\
the strands of a rope, or that are laid one upon<br>\
another as layers or strata, or side by side as the<br>\
things that compose a bundle; (قُوَاهُ, and طَاقَاتُهُ;<br>\
[rendered by Freytag “ virtutes, facultates rei; ”])<br>\
and ↓ مَثَانٍ, of which the sing. is ↓ مَثْنَاةٌ and ↓ مِثْنَاةٌ,<br>\
signifies the same. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also A bending<br>\
of the neck of a sheep, or goat, not in consequence<br>\
of disease: (K: but in the M, ثَنْىٌ [inf. n. of 1]:)<br>\
and a serpent&#39;s bending, or folding, of itself: (M,<br>\
K:) and also (thus in the M, but in the K “or”)<br>\
a curved part of a serpent that has folded itself;<br>\
(M, K;) pl. أَثْنَآءٌ, (M,) i. e. the folds of a coiled<br>\
serpent. (T.) The pl. is used metaphorically [as<br>\
though meaning (tropical:)  The turns] of a night. (M.<br>\
[But see explanations of the sing. as used in relation to a night in what precedes.] ―<br>\
-b6-  A part that<br>\
is bent, or folded, or doubled, of a وِشَاح [q. v.];<br>\
(TA;) pl. as above: (T, TA:) and so of a rope:<br>\
(S:) or a portion of the extremity of a rope<br>\
folded, or doubled, [so as to form a loop,] for<br>\
binding therewith the pastern of the fore leg of a<br>\
beast, to serve as a tether. (T.) Tarafeh says,<br>\
لَعَمْرُكَ إِنَّ المَوْتَ مَا أَخْطَأَ الفَتَى<br>\
لَكَالطِّوَلِ المُرْخَى وَثِنْيَاهُ بِالْيَدِ<br>\
[By thy life, death, while missing the strong<br>\
young man, is like the tether that is slackened<br>\
while the two folded extremities thereof are upon<br>\
the fore leg, or in the hand: see طِوَلٌ]: (T, S:)<br>\
he means that the young man must inevitably die,<br>\
though his term of life be protracted; like as the<br>\
beast, though his tether be lengthened and slackened, cannot escape, being withheld by its two<br>\
extremities: (so in a copy of the T:) or by ثنياه<br>\
he means its extremity; using the dual form<br>\
because it is folded, or doubled, upon the pastern,<br>\
and tied with a double tie: (so in another copy of<br>\
the T:) or he means, while its two extremities<br>\
are in the hand of its owner: (EM p. 91:) by<br>\
ما اخطأ, he means فِى إِخْطَائِهِ, (S in art. طول,)<br>\
or مُدَّةَ إِخْطَائِهِ: and the ل [prefixed to the ك of<br>\
comparison] is for corroboration. (EM ubi suprá.)<br>\
You say also, رَبَّقَ أَثْنَآءَ الحَبْلِ, meaning He made<br>\
loops in the middle of the rope to put upon the<br>\
necks of the young lambs or kids. (T.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Also<br>\
A bend, or place of bending, of a valley, (S, M, *<br>\
K,) and of a mountain: (S:) pl. as above: (M,<br>\
K:) and ↓ مَثَانٍ [likewise] signifies the bends of a<br>\
valley. (T, K.)<br>\
-A2-  A she-camel that has brought<br>\
forth twice, (S,) or two, (M,) or a second time:<br>\
(K:) or, as some say, that has brought forth<br>\
once: but the former is more analogical: (M:)<br>\
one does not say ثِلْثٌ [as meaning “ that has<br>\
brought forth thrice ”], nor use any similar epithet<br>\
above this: (S, TA:) pl. ثُنَآءٌ, like ظُؤَارٌ pl. of<br>\
ظِئْرٌ, accord. to Sb, (M, TA,) and أَثْنَآءٌ accord. to<br>\
others: (TA:) in like manner it is applied to a<br>\
woman, (S, M,) metaphorically: (M:) and to<br>\
the she-camel&#39;s second young one: (S, M:) accord.<br>\
to As, as related by A&#39;Obeyd, a she-camel that<br>\
has brought forth once: also that has brought<br>\
forth twice: [so says Az, but he adds,] but what<br>\
I have heard from the Arabs is this; that they<br>\
term a she-camel that has brought forth her first<br>\
young one بِكْر; and her first young one, her بِكْر;<br>\
and when she brought forth a second, she is<br>\
termed ثِنْىٌ; and her young one, her ثِنْى: and<br>\
this is what is correct. (T.) [Hence the saying,]<br>\
مَا هٰذَا الأَمْرُ مِنْكَ بِكْرًا وَلَا ثِنْيًا (tropical:)  This thing, or<br>\
affair, is not thy first nor thy second. (A and TA<br>\
in art. بكر.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also ثُنْيَانٌ.<br>\
ثَنًى: see ثِنْىٌ, first sentence.<br>\
ثُنًى: see ثِنًى: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also ثُنْيَانٌ: ―<br>\
-b3-  and<br>\
اِثْنَانِ.<br>\
ثِنًى The repetition of a thing; doing it one<br>\
time after another: (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, TA:) or a<br>\
thing, or an affair, done twice: (S, Msb, TA:)<br>\
this is the primary signification: (TA:) and ↓ ثُنًى<br>\
signifies the same. (IB, TA.) It is said in a<br>\
trad., لَا ثِنَى فِى الصَّدَقَةِ There shall be no repetition in the taking of the poor-rate; (IAth, TA;)<br>\
[i. e.] the poor-rate shall not be taken twice in one<br>\
year: (As, Ks, T, S, M, Mgh, K:) or two she-camels shall not be taken in the place of one for<br>\
the poor-rate: (M, IAth, K: *) or there shall be<br>\
no retracting of an alms; or no revoking it:<br>\
(Mgh, K, * TA:) this last is the meaning accord.<br>\
to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, (Mgh, TA,) i. e. Ed-Dareeree,<br>\
(Mgh,) who, in explaining this trad., as relating<br>\
to the giving an alms to a man and then desiring<br>\
to take it back, says he does not deny that ثِنًى<br>\
has the meaning first assigned to it above in this<br>\
paragraph. (TA.) ―<br>\

ثَنْوَى and ثُنْوَى: see ثُنْيَا, in four places.<br>\
ثُنْيَةٌ: see ثُنْيَا, in three places.<br>\
ثِنْيَةٌ The lowest, most ignoble, or meanest, of the<br>\
people of his house; applied to a man. (S, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also pl. of ثُنْيَانٌ, q. v. (S, K.)<br>\
ثُنْيَا a subst. from اِسْتِثْنَآءٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb;) as<br>\
also ↓ ثَنْوَى; the former with damm, and the latter<br>\
with fet-h: (S, Msb:) both are syn. with اِسْتِثْنَآءٌ<br>\
[used as a subst., meaning An exception]; (T;)<br>\
as also ↓ ثَنِيَّةٌ, (T, K,) or ↓ ثُنْيَةٌ, (accord. to one<br>\
copy of the T,) and ↓ مَثْنَوِيَّةٌ: (T:) so in the<br>\
saying, حَلَفَ يَمِينًا لَيْسَ فِيهَا ثُنْيَا and ↓ ثُنْوَى and<br>\
↓ ثَنِيَّةٌ or ↓ ثُنْيَةٌ and ↓ مَثْنَوِيَّةٌ [he swore an oath in<br>\
which there was not an exception]; for when the<br>\
swearer says, “By God I will not do such and<br>\
such things unless God will otherwise,” he reverses what he [first] says by God&#39;s willing otherwise: (T: [see 10:]) [and so in the saying,]<br>\
↓ حَلْفَةٌ غَيْرُ ذَاتِ مَثْنَوِيَّةٍ a swearing not made<br>\
lawful [by an exception]: (M:) [so too in the<br>\
saying,] ↓ بَيْعٌ مَا فِيهِ مَثْنَوِيَّةٌ [and ثُنْيَا &amp;c.] (K in<br>\
art. لحج) a sale in which there is not an exception: (TA in that art.:) or ثُنْيَا signifies a thing<br>\
excepted, (M, Mgh, K,) whatever it be; (K) as<br>\
also ↓ ثَنْوَى, (M, K,) with و substituted for ى,<br>\
(M,) or ↓ ثُنْوَى, (so in the TA, [but probably<br>\
through inadvertence,]) and ↓ ثَنِيَّةٌ, (M, K,) or<br>\
↓ ثُنْيَةٌ. (TA.) In a sale, it is unlawful when it is<br>\
the exception of a thing unknown; and when one<br>\
sells a slaughtered camel for a certain price and<br>\
excepts the head and extremities: (T, TA:) or<br>\
when an exception is made from things sold<br>\
without measuring or weighting or numbering:<br>\
and in a contract with another for labour upon<br>\
land on the condition of sharing the produce, it is<br>\
when one excepts a certain measure after the half<br>\
or the third. (IAth, TA.) The saying of Mo-<br>\
hammad, مَنِ اسْتَثْنَى فَلَهُ ثُنْيَاهُ means Whoso<br>\
maketh an exception, his shall be what he excepteth: (M, TA: *) as, for instance, when one<br>\
says, “I divorce her thrice, save once: ” or “ I<br>\
emancipate them, except such a one. ” (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
It also means particularly The head and legs of a<br>\
slaughtered camel; (T, M, * K;) because the<br>\
seller of the camel used, in the Time of Ignorance, to except them; (T;) and IF adds, but<br>\
incorrectly, the back-bone: (Sgh, TA:) whence,<br>\
applied to a she-camel, مُذَكَّرَةُ الثُّنْيَا, (T, M,)<br>\
meaning Resembling the make of the male in [the<br>\
largeness of] her head and legs; (Th, M;) or<br>\
جُمَالِيَّةُ الثُّنْيَا, having thick legs, like those of the<br>\
male camel in thickness. (T.) [Also, app., The<br>\
exception, or omission, of a day, in irrigation:<br>\
see 3 in art. ثلث, and ثِلْثٌ in the same art.] And<br>\
↓ ثَنِيَّةٌ signifies also A palm-tree that is excepted<br>\
from a bargain. (M, K.) And The martyrs<br>\
whom God has excepted from those who shall fall<br>\
down dead or swooning: (M, K:) these, accord.<br>\
to Kaab, are اللّٰهِ فِى الأَرْضِ ↓ ثَنِيّةُ [those whom<br>\
God has excepted on the earth]; (T, M;) alluded<br>\
to in the Kur [xxxix. 68], where it is said, “And<br>\
the horn shall be blown, and those who are in the<br>\
heavens and those on the earth shall fall down<br>\
dead, or swooning, except those whom God shall<br>\
please [to except]. ” (T.)<br>\

(of the first, S) ثِنْيَةٌ [which is also a sing., mentioned above]. (S, K.) [See an ex. in a verse<br>\
cited voce بَدْءٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  A man having no judgment<br>\
nor intelligence, or understanding. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Applied to judgment, or an opinion, (M, K,)<br>\
(tropical:)  Wrong, or having a wrong tendency; (M;)<br>\
bad, corrupt, unsound, or wrong. (K, TA.)<br>\

Also a pl. of ثَنِىٌّ [q. v.]. (S, M, &amp;c.)<br>\
ثَنَوِىٌّ rel. n. of اِثْنَانِ, and of اِثْنَا عَشَرَ, when<br>\
either or these is used as the proper name of a<br>\

mistranscription for تَثْنِيَة, inf. n. of ثَنَّى, and تَثْنِيَة<br>\
is a mistake for تَثْبِيَة, inf. n. of ثَبَّى, (see 4,)]<br>\
Praise, eulogy, or commendation, (T, S, M, Msb,<br>\
K,) of a man, (T, M,) and of God: (T:) and<br>\
dispraise, censure, or discommendation, (T, M,<br>\
Msb, K,) of a man: (T, M:) or the former only:<br>\
(M, K:) or more frequently the former: (Msb:)<br>\
so termed because it is repeated: (Ham p. 696:)<br>\
that it relates to good speech and evil is asserted<br>\
by many. (TA.)<br>\
ثُنَآءُ and ثُنَآءَ: see مَثْنَى.<br>\
ثِنَآءٌ The cord, or rope, with which a camel&#39;s<br>\
fore shank and his arm are bound together; (S,<br>\
K;) and the like; consisting of a folded, or<br>\
doubled, cord, or rope: each of the folds, or<br>\
duplicatures, thereof would be thus termed if the<br>\
word were used in the sing. form: (S:) Ibn-EsSeed [in the CK, erroneously, Ibn-Es-Seedeh]<br>\
allows it; and therefore it is given as on his<br>\
authority in the K: (TA:) and Lth allows it;<br>\
but in this instance he allows what the Arabs do<br>\
not allow: (T:) you say, عَقَلْتُ البَعِيرَ بِثِنَايَيْنِ,<br>\
meaning I bound together the fore shanks and<br>\
the arms of the camel with a rope, (S,) or with<br>\
two ropes, (M, [but this is probably a mistake of<br>\
a copyist,]) or with the two ends of a rope; (AZ,<br>\
T, S, M;) without ء because the word has no<br>\
sing.: (Kh, Sb, T, S:) Lth allows one&#39;s saying<br>\
بِثِنَآءَيْنِ also; but the Basrees and Koofees [in<br>\
general] agree that it is without ء: (T:) IB says<br>\
that it has no sing. because it is a single rope,<br>\
with one end of which one fore leg is bound, and<br>\
with the other end the other leg; and IAth says<br>\
the like: (TA:) this rope is also called ↓ ثِنَايَةٌ;<br>\
but a single rope for binding one fore shank and<br>\
arm is not thus called. (T.) See also ثِنَايَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And see ثَانٍ.<br>\
-A2-  The فِنَآء [or court, or open or<br>\
wide space, in front, or extending from the sides,]<br>\
(M, K,) of a house: (M:) [in the CK, الغِناءُ is<br>\
erroneously put for الفِناءُ:] accord. to IJ, from<br>\
ثَنَى, aor. يَثْنِى, because there one is turned back,<br>\
by its limits, from expatiating; but A&#39;Obeyd<br>\
holds the ث to be a substitute for ف. (M.)<br>\
ثَنِىٌّ Shedding his tooth called the ثَنِيَّة [q. v.]:<br>\
(S, M, Msb:) or that has shed the tooth so called:<br>\
(T, Mgh:) applied to a camel &amp;c., as follows:<br>\
(T, S, M, &amp;c.:) or, as some say, to any animal<br>\

an animal of the bovine kind, [respecting which<br>\
last see عَضْبٌ,] (T, IAth, K,) in the third year:<br>\
(T, S, IAth, Mgh, Msb, K:) or a sheep and a<br>\
goat, (M,) the latter accord. to the persuasion of<br>\
Ahmad [Ibn-Hambal], (TA,) in the second year:<br>\
(M:) and a gazelle after the age at which he is<br>\
termed جَذَعٌ: (M: [see شَصَرٌ:]) in all cases,<br>\
after what is termed جَذَعٌ and before what is<br>\
termed رَبَاعٍ: (Mgh:) pl. (masc., S, TA) ثُنْيَانٌ<br>\
and ثِنَآءٌ (S, M, Mgh, Msb) and ثُنَآءٌ, and, accord.<br>\
to Sb, ثُنٍ; (M;) and pl. fem. ثَنِيَّاتٌ. (S.)<br>\
الثُّنَىُّ, or الثُّنِىُّ: see اِثْنَانِ.<br>\
ثَنِيَّةٌ I. q. عَقَبَةٌ: (AA, M, Mgh, K:) or the<br>\
latter means a long mountain that lies across the<br>\
road, and which the road traverses; and the<br>\
former, any such mountain that is traversed:<br>\
(T:) so called because it lies before the road, and<br>\
crosses it; or because it turns away him who<br>\
traverses it: (Mgh:) or the road of what is<br>\
termed عَقَبَة: (S; and so in copies of the K:) or<br>\
a high road of what is thus termed: (K accord.<br>\
to the TA:) or a road in, or upon, a mountain,<br>\
(M, K,) like that which is termed نَقْبٌ [q. v.]:<br>\
(M:) or a road to a mountain: (M, K:) or a<br>\
mountain (M, K) itself: (M:) or a part of a<br>\
mountain that requires one, in traversing it, to<br>\
ascend and descend; as though it turned the<br>\
course of journeying: (Er-Rághib, TA:) pl. ثَنَايَا:<br>\
(T, S:) which signifies also [such roads as are<br>\
termed] مَدَارِج. (T.) Hence the phrase, فُلَانٌ<br>\
طَلَّاعُ الثَّنَايَا Such a one rises to eminences, or to<br>\
lofty things or circumstances, or to the means of<br>\
attaining such things; like the phrase طَلَّاعُ أَنْجُدٍ<br>\
[q. v.]: (S:) or, like the latter phrase, is accustomed to embark in, or undertake, or to surmount,<br>\
or master, lofty and difficult things: (Mgh:) or<br>\
is hardy, strong, or sturdy; one who embarks in,<br>\
or undertakes, great affairs. (TA. [See an ex.<br>\
under the heading of اِبْنُ جَلَا, in art. جلو: and<br>\
see also art. طلع.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) pl.<br>\
ثَنَايَا (T, S, Mgh, Msb) and ثَنِيَّاتٌ, (Msb,) One of<br>\
certain teeth, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) the foremost in the mouth, (M,) [namely, the central<br>\
incisors,] four in number, (T, M, Mgh, Msb,) to<br>\
man, and to the camel, (T, M, &amp;c.,) and to the<br>\
wild beast, (M,) in the fore part of the mouth,<br>\
(T, Mgh, K,) two above and two below: (T, M,<br>\
Mgh, K:) so called as being likened to the ثَنِيَّة<br>\
of a mountain, in form and hardness; (TA;) or<br>\
because each of them is placed next to its fellow.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  Also fem. of ثَنِىٌّ [q. v.]. (T, S, M,<br>\
&amp;c.)<br>\
-A3-  See also ثُنْيَا, in five places.<br>\
ثِنَايَةٌ A cord, or rope, of goats&#39; hair (شَعَر), or<br>\
of wool, (S, K,) or of other material; (K;) as<br>\
also ↓ ثِنَآءٌ (K) and ↓ مِثْنَاةٌ and ↓ مَثْنَاةٌ; (M, K;)<br>\
which last is explained by IAar as signifying<br>\
[simply] a cord, or rope: (M:) [or] the first<br>\
has the meaning assigned to it above, voce ثِنَآءٌ;<br>\
syn. with ثِنَايَانِ: and signifies also a long rope;<br>\
whence the saying of Zuheyr, describing the [she-camel termed] سَانِيَة,<br>\
تَمْطُو الرِّشَآءَ وَتُجْرِى فِى ثِنَايَتِهَا<br>\
مِنَ المَحَالَةِ قَبًّا رَائِدًا قَلِقَا<br>\
(T,) meaning [She draws the well-rope, and<br>\
causes to run,] with her ثناية upon her, (ISk, T,)<br>\
[a wabbling, unsteady, sheave (?) of the large<br>\
pulley;] the ثناية here being a rope of which the<br>\
two ends are tied to the saddle (قَتَب) of the<br>\
سانية; the [upper] end of the well-rope being tied<br>\
to its ↓ مِثْنَاة [which here means the folded middle<br>\
part]: (T:) but Aboo-Sa&#39;eed says that it [here]<br>\
means a piece of wood by which are connected the<br>\
two extremities of the cheeks, or side-pieces, (طرفا<br>\
الميلين, [the latter of which words I here render<br>\
conjecturally, supposing it to be similar in meaning to القَعْوِ or القَعْوَيْنِ,]) above the محالة, and<br>\
a similar piece below; the محالة and [qu. or]<br>\
the sheave turning between the tow pieces thus<br>\
called. (T, in a later portion of the art.)<br>\
ثُنَائِىٌّ [a rel. n. from اِثْنَانِ, anomalously formed,<br>\
but analogous with other rel. ns. from ns. of<br>\
number, as رُبَاعِىٌّ ثُلَاثِىٌّ, &amp;c., Of, or relating to,<br>\
two things]. ―<br>\
-b2-  كَلِمَةٌ ثُنَائِيَّةٌ A word comprising,<br>\
or composed of, two letters; as يَدٌ, and دُمْ [or دَمٌ?].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
ثِنْتَانِ a fem of اِثْنَانِ, q. v.<br>\
ثَانٍ [act. part. n. of 1; Doubling, or folding;<br>\
&amp;c.]. Hence, هُوَ ثَانٍ رِجْلَهُ While he was bending<br>\
his leg before rising, or standing up. (TA from a<br>\
trad.) [And جَآءَ ثَانِىَ عِطْفِهِ: see art. عطف.]<br>\
One says of a horseman who has bent the neck of<br>\
his beast on the occasion of his vehement running,<br>\
جَآءَ ثَانِىَ العِنَانِ [He came bending the rein by<br>\
pulling it with both hands a little apart]: (T:)<br>\
or جَآءَ ثَانِيًا مِنْ عِنَانِهِ [he came bending a part of<br>\
his rein]. (S.) And of the horse himself, one<br>\
says, جَآءَ سَابِقًا ثَانِيًا, i. e. He came outstripping,<br>\
with bent neck, by reason of briskness; because<br>\
when he is fatigued, he stretches out his neck; and<br>\
when he is not fatigued nor jaded by running,<br>\
but comes in his first run, he bends his neck:<br>\
and hence the saying of the poet,<br>\
وَمَنْ يَفْخَرْ بِمِثْلِ أَبِى وَجَدِّى<br>\
يَجِئْ قَبْلَ السَّوَابِقِ وَهُوَ ثَانِى<br>\
i. e. [And he who glories in the like of my father<br>\
and my grandfather, let him come before the<br>\
mares that outstrip,] he being like the horse that<br>\
outstrips [all others], with bent neck; or it may<br>\
mean, he bending the neck of his horse which has<br>\
outstripped the others. (T.) [Hence also,] شَاةٌ<br>\
ثَانِيَةٌ A sheep, or goat, bending the neck, not in<br>\
consequence of disease. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also Second;<br>\
the ordinal of two: fem. with ة.] You say, هٰذَا<br>\
ثَانِى هٰذَا [This is the second of this]; i. e. this is<br>\
what has made this a pair, or couple: (M:) and<br>\
فُلَانٌ (T) or هٰذَا (S) ثَانِى اثْنَيْنِ, (T, S,) i. e.<br>\
Such a one, or this, is [the second of two, or] one<br>\
of the two; (T, S;) like as you say ثَالِتُ ثَلَاثَةٍ;<br>\
and so on to عَشَرَة: but not with tenween: (S:)<br>\
[i. e.,] you may not say ثانٍ اثْنَيْنِ: (T: [see<br>\
ثَالِثٌ:]) but if the two [terms] disagree, you may<br>\
use either mode; (S;) you may say, هٰذَا (S) or<br>\
هُوَ (Mgh) ثَانِى وَاحِدٍ and ثَانٍ وَاحِدًا, (S, Mgh,)<br>\
i. e. This has become a second to one, (S,) [or<br>\
rather, becomes &amp;c. (i. e. يَثْنِى rather than ثَنَى),]<br>\
or he, or it, makes one, with himself, or itself, to<br>\
be two. (Mgh.) ↓ ثِنَآء also signifies the same in<br>\
a trad. respecting the office of commander, or<br>\
governor, or prince; where it is said, أَوَّلُهَا مَلَامَةٌ<br>\
وَثِنَاؤُهَا نَدَامَةٌ وَثِلَاثُهَا عَذابُ يَوْمِ القِيَامَةِ إِلَّا مَنْ عَدَلَ,<br>\
i. e. [The first result thereof is blame, and] the<br>\
second [is regret, and] the third [is the punishment of the day of resurrection, except in the<br>\
case of him who acts equitably]: so says Sh.<br>\
(T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And الثَّوَانِى [pl. of الثَّانِيَةُ] signifies [The<br>\
second horns;] the horns that are [next] after<br>\
the أَوَائِل. (M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [ثَانِىَ عَشَرَ and ثَانِيَةَ عَشْرَةَ,<br>\

Twelfth, are subject to the same rules as ثَالِثَ<br>\
عَشَرَ and its fem., explained in art. ثلث.]<br>\
أَثْنَآءٌ pl. of ثِنْىٌ and of اِثْنَانِ: and also syn.<br>\
with this latter, q. v.<br>\
اِثْنِىٌّ: see ثَنَوِىٌّ.<br>\
اِثْنَانِ a noun of number; (S, Msb;) applied to<br>\
the dual number; (Msb;) meaning [Two;] the<br>\
double of وَاحِدٌ; (M, K;) with a conjunctive ا<br>\
[when not immediately preceded by a quiescence,<br>\
written اثْنَانِ]; (T, S, Msb;) but this is sometimes made disjunctive when connected with a<br>\
preceding word by poetic license: (T, S:) of the<br>\
masc. gender: (S:) fem. اِثْنَتَانِ, (T, S, Msb,) in<br>\
which, also, the ا is conjunctive; (T, Msb;) and<br>\
↓ ثِنْتَانِ; (T S, M, Msb, K;) the latter sometimes<br>\
used, (T,) [much less frequently than the former,<br>\
though the only fem. form mentioned in the M<br>\
and K,] and of the dial. of Temeem; (Msb;)<br>\
like as one says, هِىَ ابْنَةُ فُلَانٍ and هِىَ بِنْتُهُ: (T:)<br>\
the ت in the dual is a substitute for the final<br>\
radical, ى, (M, TA,) as it is in أَسْنَتُوا, the only<br>\
other instance of this substitution except in words<br>\
of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ: (Sb, M, TA:) in اِثْنَانِ,<br>\
the final radical, ى is suppressed: (Msb:) it<br>\
has no sing.: (Lth, T:) if it were allowable to<br>\
assign to it a sing., it would be اِثْنٌ [for the<br>\
masc.] and اِثْنَةٌ [for the fem.], like اِبْنٌ and اِبْنَةٌ:<br>\
(S:) accord. to some, (Msb,) it is originally<br>\
ثِنْىٌ; (T, Msb, CK;) and hence the dual ثِنْتَانِ:<br>\
(Msb:) or it is originally ثَنَىٌ, (M, Msb, and so<br>\
in a copy of the K,) the conjunctive ا being then<br>\
substituted for the ى whence the dual اثْنَانِ,<br>\
like ابْنَانِ: (Msb:) this is shown by the form of<br>\
its pl., which is أَثْنَآءٌ, (M, K,) like أَبْنَآءٌ [pl. of<br>\
ابْنٌ, which is originally بَنَىٌ or بَنَوٌ,] and آخَآءٌ<br>\
[pl. of أَخٌ, which is originally أَخَوٌ]. (M.) In<br>\
the saying in the Kur [xvi. 53], لَا تَتَّخِذُوا إِٰلهَيْنِ<br>\
اثْنَيْنِ [Take not to yourselves two gods], the last<br>\
word is added as a corroborative. (M.) The<br>\
phrase ثِنْتَا حَنْظَلٍ occurs, by poetic license, for<br>\
اِثْنَتَانِ مِنْ حَنْظَلٍ, meaning حَنْظَلَتَانِ [Two colo-<br>\
cynths]. (S.) You say also, القَدَحِ ↓ شَرِبْتُ أَثْنَآءَ,<br>\
and شَرِبْتُ اثْنَىْ هٰذَا القَدَحِ, meaning [I drank]<br>\
twice as much as the bowl, and as this bowl: and<br>\
in like manner, شَرِبْتُ اثْنَىْ مُدِّ البَصْرَةِ and اثْنَيْنِ<br>\
بِمُدِّ البَصْرَةِ [I drank twice the quantity of the مُدّ<br>\
of El-Basrah]. (M.) And a poet says,<br>\
↓ فَمَا حُلِبَتْ إِلَّا الثَّلَاثَةَ وَالثُّنَى<br>\
وَلَا قُيِّلَتْ إِلَّا قَرِيبًا مَقَالُهَا<br>\
meaning [And she was not milked save] three<br>\
vessels and two, [nor was she given her middaydrink save when her midday-resting was near.]<br>\
(IAar, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (Msb,) يَوْمُ الاِثْنَيْنِ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) or الاِثْنَانِ alone, (M, K,) One of the days<br>\
of the week; [the second; namely, Monday;]<br>\
because the first, with the Arabs, is الأَحَدُ; (M;)<br>\
as also ↓ الثِّنَى, like إِلَى; (K;) so in the copies<br>\
of the K; [or,] accord. to some, ↓ الثُّنِىُّ, [originally الثُّنُوىُ,] of the measure فُعُول, like ثُدِىٌّ<br>\
[pl. of ثَدْىٌ], is used in this sense; (TA;) or<br>\
↓ اليَوْمُ الثُّنَىُّ, [so in the M, accord. to the TT,]<br>\
mentioned by Sb, on the authority of certain of<br>\
the Arabs: (M:) the pl. is أَثْنَآءٌ and أَثَانِينُ, (M,<br>\
K,) the latter mentioned on the authority of Th:<br>\
but it has no dual: and those who say أَثْنَآءٌ form<br>\
this pl. from الاِثْنُ, although this has not been in<br>\
use: (M:) or it has neither dual nor pl., (S,<br>\
Msb,) being itself a dual; (S;) but if you would<br>\
form a pl. from it, you would regard it as itself a<br>\
sing., and make its pl. أَثَانِينُ: (S, Msb:) IB says<br>\
that أَثَانِينُ has not been heard [from the Arabs],<br>\
and is only mentioned by Fr, on the ground of<br>\
analogy; that it is far-fetched in respect of analogy;<br>\
and that the pl. heard is أَثْنَآءٌ: Seer and others<br>\
mention, as heard from the Arabs, إِنَّهُ لَيَصُومُ الأَثْنَآءَ<br>\
[Verily he fasts on the Mondays]. (TA.) الثنين<br>\
in يوم الثنين has no dim. (Sb, S in art. امس.)<br>\
IJ says that the article ال in الثنين is not redundant, though the word is not an epithet:<br>\
Abu-l-&#39;Abbás says that the prefixing of the article<br>\
in this case is allowable because the virtual meaning is اليَوْمُ الثَّانِى [the second day]. (M.) The<br>\
saying اليَوْمُ الاِثْنَانِ means The name of to-day [is<br>\
الاثنان]; and is like the saying اليَوْمُ يَوْمَانِ [to-day<br>\
is two days] and اليَوْمُ خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ مِنَ الشَّهْرِ [to-day<br>\
is fifteen of the month]. (Sb, M.) Sometimes,<br>\
يَوْمُ اثْنَيْنِ, without the article ال, occurs in poetry.<br>\
(M, K.) When a pronoun refers to الاثنان [as<br>\
meaning Monday], this word may be treated in<br>\
two ways, [as a sing. and as a dual,] but the more<br>\
chaste way is to treat it as a sing., as meaning<br>\
the day: (Msb:) [thus,] Aboo-Ziyád used to say,<br>\
مَضَى الاِثْنَانِ بِمَا فِيهِ [Monday passed with what<br>\
occurred in it]; making it sing. and masc.; and<br>\
thus he did in the case of every day of the week,<br>\
except that he made الجُمْعَة fem.: Abu-I-Jarráh<br>\
used to say, مَضَى الاِثْنَانِ بِمَا فِيهِمَا, treating the<br>\
word as a numeral; and thus he treated the third<br>\
and fourth and fifth days, saying in each of these<br>\
cases بِمَا فِيهِنَّ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [اِثْنَا عَشَرَ, fem. اِثْنَتَا عَشْرَةَ;<br>\
respectively, in a case of nasb and khafd, اِثْنَىْ عَشَرَ<br>\
and اِثْنَتَىْ عَشْرَةَ; and with ا when not immediately<br>\
preceded by a quiescence; mean Twelve: see<br>\

the week. (IAar, Th, M, K.)<br>\
الاِثْنَيْنِيَّةُ [The doctrine of dualism: see ثَنَوِىٌّ].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَثْنَى (S, Mgh) and ↓ ثُنَآءُ (T, S) [Two and<br>\
two; two and two together; or two at a time and<br>\
two at a time]: they are imperfectly decl., in like<br>\
manner as [مَثْلَثُ and] ثُلَاثُ, as explained in art.<br>\
ثلث; (S, TA;) [because] changed from the original form of اِثْنَانِ اثْنَانِ; (T, Mgh, TA;) or<br>\
because of their having the quality of epithets and<br>\
deviating from the original form of اِثْنَانِ; (Sb, S<br>\
in art. ثلث, q. v.;) or because they deviate from<br>\
their original as to the letter and the meaning;<br>\
the original word being changed as above stated,<br>\
and the meaning being changed to اِثْنَانِ اثْنَانِ.<br>\
(S ibid.) You say, جَاؤُوا مَثْنَى and ↓ ثُنَآءَ (M, K)<br>\
or مَثْنَى مَثْنَى, (S,) but this is a repetition of the<br>\
word only, not of the meaning, (Mgh,) and in<br>\
like manner one says of women, (M, K, *) i. e.<br>\
They came two [and] two. (S, M, K.) And it is<br>\
said in a trad., صَلَاةُ اللَّيْلِ مَثْنَى مَثْنَى, i. e. The<br>\
prayer of night is two rek&#39;ahs [and] two rek&#39;ahs<br>\
(رَكْعَتَانِ رَكْعَتَانِ). (TA.) [See also other exs.<br>\
voce ثُلَاثُ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  مَثْنَى الأَيَادِى The repeating a<br>\
benefit, or benefaction; or reiterating it; conferring it twice, or thrice; (As, T, K;) or twice,<br>\
or more than twice: (K:) or the shares remaining<br>\
of the slaughtered camel (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, K)<br>\
in the game called المَيْسِر, (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, K,)<br>\
which shares a bountiful man used to purchase,<br>\
and give for food to the أَبْرَام, (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S,<br>\
M, K,) i. e., those who took no part in the game,<br>\
not contributing: (M:) or the taking a portion<br>\
time after time. (AA, T, S, M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  مَثَانٍ [is pl.<br>\
of مَثْنًى as signifying A place of doubling, or<br>\
folding &amp;c.: and hence means ―<br>\
-b4- ] The knees<br>\
and elbows of a horse or similar beast. (T, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And The bends of a valley. (T, K. See ثِنْىٌ.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And, as pl. of مَثْنًى, The chords of the lute that<br>\
are after the first: (M, K:) or مثنى signifies<br>\
a chord [of a lute] composed of two twists: or,<br>\
as some say, the second chord. (Har p. 244. See<br>\
مَثْلَثٌ.) ―<br>\
-b7-  مَثْنًى also signifies The زِمَام [or noserein] of a she-camel: and Er-Rághib says that<br>\
the مثناة [i. e. ↓ مَثْنَاة or ↓ مِثْنَاة] is the doubled, or<br>\
folded, part of the extremity of the زِمَام. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  المَثَانِى as relating to the Kur-án is pl. of مَثْنًى,<br>\
(Mgh,) or of ↓ مَثْنَاةٌ: (AHeyth, T, Mgh:) it has<br>\
three applications, accord. to A&#39;Obeyd: (T, Mgh:)<br>\
it signifies The Kur-án altogether; (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
T, S, M, Mgh, K;) so in the Kur xxxix 24;<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, T, Mgh;) meaning that the mention<br>\
of reward and punishment is repeated, or reiterated, in it; (Fr, T;) or so called because the<br>\
verse of mercy is conjoined with that of punishment; (S;) or because narratives and promises<br>\
and threats are repeated in it; or because one<br>\
peruses it repeatedly without being wearied:<br>\
(Mgh:) or it signifies, (M, K,) or signifies also,<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, Mgh,) [the first chapter, called]<br>\
the فَاتِحَة, (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, Mgh,) or الحَمْدُ,<br>\
(K,) which means the same; (TA;) so in the<br>\
Kur xv. 87; (A&#39;Obeyd, T, Mgh;) because it is<br>\
repeated, or recited twice, in every [act of prayer<br>\
termed a] رَكْعَة, (Fr, Zj, AHeyth, T, S,) or with<br>\
every chapter, (Th, M,) or in every prayer;<br>\
(Mgh;) or because containing praise of God:<br>\
(Zj, T, Mgh:) [but see السَّبْعُ المَثَانِى voce سَبْعَةٌ:]<br>\
or it signifies, (M, K,) or signifies also, (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
T, S, Mgh,) the chapters that are less than those<br>\
containing a hundred verses, (S, M, Mgh,) or<br>\
that are less than the long ones (الطُّوَل, q. v.),<br>\
and less than those containing a hundred verses,<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, T, K, but in [most of] the copies of<br>\
the K دُونَ المِأَتَيْنِ is put in the place of دُونَ المِئِينَ,<br>\
which is the right reading, TA,) and more than<br>\
[those of the portion called] the مُفَصَّل, (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
T, Mgh, K,) as is related on the authority of the<br>\
Prophet by Ibn-Mes&#39;ood and &#39;Othmán and Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbás; (AHeyth, T;) because, (Mgh,) or as<br>\
though, (T,) occupying the second place after<br>\
those containing a hundred verses: (T, Mgh:) or<br>\
the chapters, (T, K,) six and twenty in number,<br>\
(T,) entitled الحَجّ and القَصَص and النَّمْل and<br>\
النُّور and الأَنْفَال and مَرْيَم and العَنْكَبُوت and<br>\

الزُّخْرُف and السَّجْدَة and الأَحْقَاف and الجَاثِيَة and<br>\
الدُّخَان (T, K) and الأَحْزَاب, (K,) which last has<br>\
been omitted by the copyists of the T: (TA:) or<br>\
the chapters of which the first is the بَقَرَة, and the<br>\
last is بَرَآءَة: or what is repeated, of the Kur-án,<br>\
time after time. (M, K.)<br>\
مَثْنَاةٌ; pl. مَثَانٍ: see ثِنْىٌ: and ثِنَايَةٌ: and مَثْنًى;<br>\
the last in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in a trad. that<br>\
one of the signs of the resurrection will be the<br>\
public reading, or reciting, of the مَثْنَاة, (T, S,)<br>\
which means That which has been desired to be<br>\
transcribed from a source other than the Book of<br>\
God: (T:) or a certain book, (T, K,) [the<br>\
Mishna,] which the learned men, and the recluses,<br>\
of the Children of Israel, after Moses, composed<br>\
after their own desire, from a source other than<br>\
the Book of God, as A&#39;Obeyd says on the<br>\
authority of a man learned in the books of the<br>\
earlier times, (T,) containing the histories of the<br>\
Children of Israel after Moses, in which they<br>\
allowed and disallowed what they pleased: (K:)<br>\
or what is sung: (K:) or what is called in Persian دُو بَيْتِى, (S, K,) which means two verses,<br>\
each composed of a pair of hemistichs; (TA;)<br>\
i. e. what is sung; but A&#39;Obeyd explains it<br>\
otherwise than thus: (S:) it is what is known<br>\
among the &#39;Ajam by the term ↓ مَثْنَوِىٌّ, as though<br>\
this were a rel. n. from مَثْنَاةٌ: the vulgar say<br>\
[erroneously] ذُو بَيْت, with the pointed ذ. (TA.)<br>\
مِثْنَاةٌ; pl. مَثَانٍ: see ثِنْىٌ: and ثِنَايَةٌ; the latter<br>\
in two places: and see also مَثْنًى.<br>\
مُثَنًّى [pass. part. n. of 2. ―<br>\

with two points below: an epithet added to يآء to<br>\
prevent its being mistaken for بآء or تآء or ثآء.]<br>\
―<br>\

of sight, or disappears,] by length; mostly used<br>\
of a thing that is long without breadth. (TA.)<br>\
