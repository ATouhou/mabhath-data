ثَفِنَةٌ [The callosity, or callous protuberance,<br>\

lower parts, of the thighs; of the camel: (M, K: *)<br>\
pl. ثِفَنٌ and ثِفَانٌ (M, K) and ثِفِنَاتٌ: (T, S, M:)<br>\
the ثَفِنَات of the camel are the parts that fall upon<br>\
the ground when the animal lies down, and that<br>\
become rough, or callous, such as the two knees,<br>\
&amp;c.; (S;) the parts that are next the ground<br>\
when the camel lies down, one of them being the<br>\
كِرْكِرَة, with which they are five in number [as<br>\
explained above]: or, as some say, the ثَفِنَة is<br>\
[only the stifle-joint, i. e.,] the joint between the<br>\
thigh and the ساق [or leg properly so called],<br>\
internally, [meaning anteriorly,] and [the knee,<br>\
i. e.,] the joint between the shank and the arm:<br>\
(T:) or, accord. to some, any part that is next<br>\
the ground, of any quadruped, when he lies down<br>\
like the camel and like the sheep. (M.) ―<br>\

(TA,) [The stifle-joint, i. e.,] the joint between each<br>\
thigh and leg, internally, [meaning anteriorly,]<br>\

knee of a man: or [so accord. to the M, but in<br>\
the K “ and,”] the place of union of the shank<br>\
and thigh: (M, K:) [or the lower portion of the<br>\
fore part of the knee, which becomes callous in<br>\
consequence of much kneeling: see 3, first sentence. Hence,] &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Wahb Er-Rásibee<br>\
was surnamed ذُو الثَّفِنَاتِ (S, M, K *) from his much<br>\
praying, (M,) because long prostration produced<br>\
an [indurating] effect upon his ثفنات: (S, K:) and<br>\
&#39;Alee Ibn-El-Hoseyn Ibn-&#39;Alee, (K, TA,) known<br>\
by the appellation of Zeyn-el-&#39;Ábìdeen, (TA,) was<br>\
[likewise] so surnamed, (K, TA,) because those<br>\
parts of him upon which he prostrated himself<br>\
were like the ثفنة of the camel in consequence of his<br>\
much praying: (TA:) so too was &#39;Alee Ibn-AbdAllah Ibn-El-&#39;Abbás. (A, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  الثَّفِنَةُ مِنَ الجُلَّةِ,<br>\
(K, [in some of the copies of the K الحُلَّة, which,<br>\
as is said in the TA, is a mistake,]) or ثَفِنَتَا الجُلَّةِ,<br>\
(AHn, M,) The two edges of the lower part of the<br>\
جُلَّة, (AHn, M, K,) [meaning,] of the dates [contained in the receptacle thus called; app. because<br>\
the dates in the edges become more dry and hard<br>\
than the main portion]. (AHn, M.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A<br>\
number, and a company, of men. (M, K.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
And [as fem. of ثَفِنٌ, which is perhaps unused,]<br>\
A she-camel that strikes with her ثَفِنَات [here<br>\
meaning her stifle-joints] on the occasion of her<br>\
being milked. (M, K.) Her case is easier than<br>\
that of the ضَجُور. (M.)<br>\
مُثْفَنٌ, (M,) or ↓ مُثْفِنٌ, (TA,) may mean Large<br>\
in the ثَفِنَات. (M, TA.)<br>\
مُثْفِنٌ: see مُثْفِنٌ:<br>\

مِثْفَانٌ A camel whose ثَفِنَة [here meaning his<br>\
stifle-joint] has hit, or hurt, his side and his belly,<br>\
(K, TA,) usually. (TA.)<br>\
مُثَافِنٌ Keeping to a person, or thing, constantly,<br>\
perseveringly, or assiduously: (T, M:) or keeping, cleaving, or clinging, to another: as also<br>\
↓ مُثْفِنٌ or ↓ مُثِفِّنٌ (K, accord. to different copies,)<br>\
[or, probably, مِثْفَنٌ, q. v.].<br>\
