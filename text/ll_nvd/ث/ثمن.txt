ثَمَنٌ The price of a thing; i. e. the thing that<br>\
the seller receives in return for the thing sold,<br>\
whether money or a commodity; (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA;) the ثَمَن of a thing sold: (S:) and also<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA) a compensation, or substitute,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, Er-Rághib, TA,) whatever it be, for<br>\
a thing, (Er-Rághib, TA,) i. e., for a thing that<br>\
is sold; but in the sense commonly known, such<br>\
as it is incumbent upon one to pay, of pieces of<br>\
silver, and of gold [or other money]; not commodities and the like: (Mgh:) or the value, or<br>\
worth, of a thing; (K;) its قِيمَة: (T:) or the<br>\
estimated value, or worth, of a thing, by mutual<br>\
consent, even though it be really excessive or<br>\
deficient; whereas the قِيمَة is its real value or<br>\
worth, its equivalent: (MF:) pl. أَثْمَانٌ (T, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K) and أَثْمُنٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the latter used<br>\
only as a pl. of pauc., (Msb,) and [so] أَثْمِنَةٌ.<br>\
(CK: not in the TA.) The saying in the Kur<br>\
[ii. 38 and v. 48], وَلَا تَشْتَرُوا بِآيَاتِى ثَمَنًا قَلِيلًا is<br>\
metaphorical, meaning (tropical:)  And take ye not in exchange for my signs a small substitute: [i. e.<br>\
purchase not in exchange for belief in my word<br>\
the happiness, or enjoyments, of the present life.]<br>\
(Mgh.) With respect to this saying, Fr remarks,<br>\
when ثَمَنًا occurs in the Kur, with بِ prefixed to<br>\
the name of the thing sold or bought, in most cases<br>\
it relates to two things whereof neither is a ثمن<br>\
in the sense commonly known, i. e., such as<br>\
pieces of gold and of silver: and such is the case<br>\
when you say, اِشْتَرَيْتُ ثَوْبًا بِكِسَآءٍ [I purchased a<br>\
garment with a كساء, q. v.]: either of these<br>\
may be termed a ثمن for the other: but in<br>\
speaking of pieces of silver and of gold, you<br>\
prefix the ب to the ثمن [only]; as is done in<br>\
[the chapter of] Yoosuf, [i. e. ch. xii., v. 20,<br>\
where it is said,] وَشَرَوْهُ بِثَمَنٍ بَخْسٍ دَرَاهِمَ مَعْدُودَةٍ<br>\
[And they sold him for a deficient, or an insufficient, price: for pieces of silver not many, so as<br>\
to require their being weighed, but few, and therefore counted]: for pieces of silver are always a<br>\
ثمن: and when you purchase pieces of silver<br>\
and of gold with the like, you prefix the ب to<br>\
whichever of the two you will, because each of<br>\
them in this case is a purchase and a price. (T.)<br>\
ثُمُنٌ (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ ثُمْنٌ (M,<br>\
Msb, K) An eighth; an eighth part or portion;<br>\
as also ↓ ثَمِينٌ; (S, M, * Mgh, Msb, K;) agreeably with a general rule applying to fractions,<br>\
accord. to some; (M, K;) but ثَلِيثٌ was ignored<br>\
by AZ (T and S in art. ثلث) and by others,<br>\
(TA,) and so was خَمِيسٌ: (S in art. ثلث:) pl.<br>\
أَثْمَانٌ. (M, K.)<br>\
ثَمَانٍ and ثَمَانٌ: see ثَمَانِيَةٌ.<br>\
ثَمِينٌ: see ثُمُنٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also High-priced; or of<br>\
high value; (S, TA;) and ↓ مُثْمِنٌ [signifies the<br>\
same; or] having a price, or value: (TA:) but<br>\
accord. to the Durrat el-Ghowwás, the assertion<br>\
that the former has the meaning here assigned<br>\
to it is a mistake; for it means [only] the same<br>\
as ثُمُنٌ; and a thing that has a price, or value,<br>\
is termed مثمن [app. مُثْمِنٌ, as above; but perhaps<br>\
مُثْمَنٌ, q. v.]. (Har p. 42.)<br>\
ثَمَانِيَةٌ a noun of number, well known; [meaning Eight;] as also ↓ ثَمَانٍ, (M, TA,) which is<br>\
like يَمَانٍ, (M, K,) in form: (M:) the former is<br>\
the masc. form: the latter, the fem.: (Msb:)<br>\
this is not a rel. n. [though likened above to<br>\
يَمَانٍ]: (M, K:) or it is originally a rel. n. from<br>\
الثُّمُنُ, because it is the part, or portion, that<br>\
makes seven to be eight, so that it is its eighth:<br>\
they make the first letter to be pronounced with<br>\
fet-h, because they make changes [in some other<br>\
cases] in the rel. n., (S, K,) as when they say<br>\
سُهْلِىٌّ and دُهْرِىٌّ, [which are rel. ns. of سَهْلٌ and<br>\
دَهْرٌ,] (S,) and they suppress one of the two ى<br>\
which are characteristic of the rel. n., and compensate it by the insertion of ا, as they do in the<br>\
rel. n. of اليَمَنُ [when they say يَمَانٍ, originally<br>\
يَمَانِىٌ, for يَمَنِىٌّ]: (S, K: [and the like is said<br>\
in the Mgh:]) El-Fárisee says that the ا of ثَمَانٍ<br>\
is the characteristic of the rel. n., because this<br>\
word is not a broken pl. like صَحَارٍ; and IF<br>\
assents to this, and says that were it not so, the ة<br>\
would be inseparable, as it is in عَبَاقِيَةٌ &amp;c. (M.)<br>\
You say ثَمَانِيَةُ رِجَالٍ [Eight men], (T, S, Mgh,)<br>\
and ثَمَانِيَةُ أَيَّامٍ [eight days]. (Msb.) And when<br>\
ثمان is prefixed to another noun, its ى is retained,<br>\
like the ى in القَاضِى: (S, Msb, K:) and it is<br>\
decl. in the same manner as words of the class to<br>\
which this last belongs: (Msb:) you say ثَمَانِى نِسْوَةٍ<br>\
[Eight women], (T, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ثَمَانِى<br>\
مِائَةٍ [eight hundred], (S, Msb, K,) [in the nom.<br>\
and gen. cases;] and رَأَيْتُ ثَمَانِىَ نِسْوَةٍ [I saw<br>\
eight women], pronouncing the fet-hah [at the<br>\
end, in this case]. (Msb.) When it is with<br>\
tenween, the ى is dropped in the nom. and gen.<br>\
cases, but it is retained in the accus. case: (S,<br>\
K:) [i. e.,] when the fem. form is not prefixed<br>\
to another noun, you say, عِنْدِى مِنَ النِّسَآءِ ثَمَانٍ<br>\
[I have with me, of women, eight], and مَرَرْتُ<br>\
مِنْهُنَّ بِثَمَانٍ [I passed by, of them, eight], and<br>\
رَأَيْتُ ثَمَانِيًا [I saw eight]. (Msb.) It sometimes<br>\
occurs, in poetry, indecl.: (S, M:) this is because<br>\
it is fancied to be a pl.; (S;) or because it is<br>\
likened, as to the letter, but not as to the meaning, to جَوَارِىَ. (M.) The people of El-Hijáz<br>\
pronounce the masc. and the fem. with nasb in<br>\
every case, in phrases like أَتَوْنِى ثَلَاثَتَهُمْ and<br>\
أَتَيْنَنِى ثَلَاثَهُنَّ; and so on to ten [inclusive]. (S<br>\
voce ثَلَاثَةٌ, q. v.) Th mentions ↓ ثَمَانٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and some instances of its occurrence are cited;<br>\
but As disallows it. (T, Mgh, TA.) كِسَآءٌ ذُو<br>\
ثَمَانٍ means A [garment of the kind called] كساء<br>\
made of eight fleeces. (T.) تُقْبِلُ بِأَرْبَعٍ وَتُدْبِرُ<br>\
بِثَمَانٍ [She advances with four and goes back<br>\
with eight] is a saying of one of the مُخَنَّثُون of<br>\
El-Medeeneh; meaning, with four creases (عُكَن)<br>\
of the belly, and with eight extremities thereof;<br>\
each crease having two extremities, towards the<br>\
two sides of the woman spoken of. (Mgh in art.<br>\
هيت.) The saying الثَّوْبُ سَبْعٌ فِى ثَمَانٍ should<br>\
properly be فِى ثَمَانِيَةٍ, (S,) which means, The<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth, is seven cubits in<br>\
length by eight spans in breadth; (Msb;) because<br>\
the length is measured by the ذِرَاع, which is fem.,<br>\
and the breadth by the شِبْر, which is masc.; but<br>\
they use the fem. when they do not mention<br>\
things; as when they say, صُمْنَا مِنَ الشَّهْرِ خَمْسًا<br>\
[We fasted, of the month, five], though meaning<br>\
days: (S:) or because ذراع is fem. in most instances, and شبر is masc. (Msb.) [But it is said<br>\
that when ثمانية means the things numbered, not<br>\
the amount of the number, it is imperfectly decl.,<br>\
being regarded as a proper name: thus] you say,<br>\
تِسْعَةُ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ ثَمَانِيَةَ [Nine things are more than<br>\
eight things]. (TA voce تِسْعَةٌ, q. v.) [See also<br>\
سِتَّةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  When you make it a compound [with<br>\
the number ten], you say, عِنْدَى ثَمَانِيَةَ عَشَرَ رَجُلًا<br>\
[I have with me eighteen men]: and in the case<br>\
of the fem., you may either make the ى to be<br>\
with fet-h or make it quiescent, saying, عِنْدِى<br>\
مِنَ النِّسَآءِ ثَمَانِىَ عَشْرَةَ امْرَأَةً or ثَمَانِىْعَشْرَةَ [I have<br>\
with me, of women, eighteen women]; but the<br>\
former is the more chaste; and in one dial., the<br>\
ى is elided, on the condition of [saying ثَمَانَ<br>\
عَشْرَةَ,] making the ن to be with fet-h; (Msb;)<br>\
or in this case you say ثَمَانِ عَشْرَةَ, with kesr.<br>\
(T.) A poet says, (T, S,) namely, El-Aashà, (K,)<br>\
فَلَأَشْرَبَنَّ ثَمَانِيًا وَثَمَانِيًا<br>\
وَثَمَانِ عَشْرَةَ وَاثْنَتَيْنِ وَأَرْبَعَا<br>\
[And I will assuredly drink eight cups of wine,<br>\
(a pl. of كَأْس, which is fem., being understood,)<br>\
and eight more, and eighteen, and two, and four]:<br>\
(T, S, K: but in the S and K, وَلَقَدْ شَرِبْتُ; and<br>\
in the K, and in one copy of the S, وَثَمَانَ:) he<br>\
should properly have said ثَمَانِىَ عَشْرَةَ or ثَمَانِىْ<br>\
عَشْرَةَ, (accord. to different copies of the T and S<br>\
and K,) but he elides the ى after the dial. of him<br>\
who says طِوَالُ الأَيْدِ [for الأَيْدِى], (S, K,) and<br>\
he makes the ن to be with kesr in order to indicate the ى. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The dim. of ثَمَانِيَةٌ may<br>\
be formed either by suppressing the ا, which is the<br>\
preferable way, so that you say ↓ ثُمَيْنِيَةٌ, or by<br>\
suppressing the ى, saying ↓ ثُمَيِّنَةٌ, changing the ا<br>\
into ى and incorporating into it the ى that is the<br>\
characteristic of the dim.; and you may compensate for both [of these suppressed letters by<br>\
saying ↓ ثُمَيْنِيَّةٌ and ↓ ثُمَيِّينَةٌ]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  الثَّمَانِى is<br>\
also the name of A certain plant. (As, T, K.)<br>\
ثَمَانُونَ a well-known noun of number; [meaning Eighty;] sometimes used as an epithet: ElAashà says,<br>\
لَئِنْ كُنْتَ فِى جُبٍّ ثَمَانِينَ قَامَةً<br>\
وَرُقِّيتَ أَسْبَابَ السِّمَآءِ بِسُلَّمِ<br>\
[Assuredly if thou wert in a well eighty fathoms<br>\
deep, and wert made to ascend the tracts of<br>\
heaven by a ladder]: he uses it thus as meaning<br>\
deep. (TA. [But in this verse, as cited in the<br>\
present art in the TA, أَبْوَابَ is put in the place<br>\
of اسباب, which is the reading commonly known,<br>\
and given in the S and TA in art. سب, and in<br>\
the TA in art رقى-]) أَحْمَقُ مِنْ صَاحَبِ ضَأْنٍ ثَمَانِينَ<br>\
[More stupid than an owner of eighty sheep], (S,<br>\
K,) or مِنْ رَاعِى ضَأْنٍ ثَمَانِينَ [than a pastor of<br>\
eighty sheep], as in some of the copies of the S, or,<br>\
as in the Proverbs of Aboo-&#39;Obeyd, مِنْ طَالِبِ ضَأْنٍ<br>\
ثَمَانِينَ [than a demander of eighty sheep], (TA,)<br>\
is a saying that originated from the fact that an<br>\
Arab of the desert announced to Kisrà an event<br>\
that rejoiced him, whereupon he said, “Ask of<br>\
me what thou wilt; ” and he asked of him eighty<br>\
sheep. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It also signifies Eightieth.]<br>\
ثُمَيْنِيَةٌ and ثُمَيِّنَةٌ and ثُمَيْنِيَّةٌ and ثُمَيَّينَةٌ: see ثَمَانِيَةٌ,<br>\
last sentence but one.<br>\
ثَامِنٌ [Eighth: fem. with ة]. (S, K, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[ثَامِنَ عَشَرَ and ثَامِنَةَ عَشْرَةَ, the former masc. and<br>\
the latter fem., meaning Eighteenth, are subject<br>\
to the same rules as ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ and its fem., explained in art. ثلث, q. v.] ―<br>\
-b3-  إِبِلٌ ثَوَامِنُ, [the<br>\
latter word pl. of ثَامِنَةٌ,] Camels that come to<br>\
water on the eighth night [after the next preceding<br>\
watering]: from ثِمْنٌ. (TA.)<br>\
أَثْمَنُ Of more [and of most] price or value. (S.)<br>\
مُثْمَنٌ Sold for a price: (Msb:) or having a<br>\
price named for it, and assigned to it. (Mgh.)<br>\
[See also ثَمِينٌ.]<br>\
مُثْمِنٌ: see ثَمِينٌ<br>\
مِثْمَنَةٌ A مِخْلَاة [or nose-bag]: (IAar, T:) or<br>\
the like thereof. (S.)<br>\
مُثَمَّنٌ Octangular. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A verse composed<br>\
