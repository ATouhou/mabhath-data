ثَرَبَهُ, aor.<br>\
ثَرِبَ, (K,) inf. n. ثَرْبٌ, (TK,) [probably, in its primary sense, He stripped it of its<br>\
ثَرْب: see 2: ―<br>\
-b2-  and hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He stripped him of<br>\
his garment; namely, a sick man. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See<br>\
also 2, in three places.<br>\
2<br>\
تَثْرِيبٌ, in its primary sense, is The removing<br>\
of the ثَرْب, i. e., the fat that forms the integument<br>\
of the stomach of a ruminant: so says Z. (Har<br>\
p. 197.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (tropical:)  The act of blaming;<br>\
reproving; and punishing, or chastising, for an<br>\
offence, or a crime: (Har ubi suprà:) or (tropical:)  severe<br>\
blaming or reproving, that rends reputations,<br>\
and takes away the brightness of countenances:<br>\
(Z in Har ubi suprá:) which last meaning it has<br>\
in the Kur xii. 92: (Bd:) or لَا تَثْرِيبَ عَلَيْكُمْ<br>\
there means (assumed tropical:)  No evil, or mischief, shall come upon<br>\
you: (Zj, T:) or (assumed tropical:)  your offences, or crimes, shall<br>\
not be mentioned: (Th, M:) تثريب signifies (assumed tropical:)  the<br>\
act of blaming, or reproving; (S, Mgh;) or doing<br>\
so severely, or angrily; or, with the utmost severity or harshness: the act of upbraiding, or reproaching: and the going to the utmost length in<br>\
blaming or reproving: one says, لَا تَثْرِيبَ عَلَيْكَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [No blame, &amp;c., shall be laid on thee]: and it is<br>\
from الثَّرْبُ [as explained above]. (S.) You say,<br>\
ثرّب and ↓ ثَرَبَ and ↓ اثرب, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He blamed,<br>\
or reproved; or did so severely, or with the utmost<br>\
severity; or reproached, or upbraided: (T:) and<br>\
ثرّب عَلَيْهِ, (S, M, K,) and ثّربهُ; (A, K;) and<br>\
↓ ثَرَبَهُ, [and ثَرَبَ عليه,] aor.<br>\
ثَرِبَ, (K,) inf. n. ثَرْبٌ;<br>\
(TK;) and ↓ اثربهُ; (A, K;) (assumed tropical:)  he blamed him, or<br>\
reproved him; upbraided him, or reproached<br>\
him, (M, A, K,) with, or for, his offence, or<br>\
crime; (M, K;) and reminded him thereof;<br>\
(M;) he showed him his deed to be foul, abominable, or bad: (As, S:) or عليه ↓ ثَرَبَ, aor.<br>\
ثَرِبَ,<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  he blamed him, or reproved him; and,<br>\
as Suh says, ثرّب عليه, (assumed tropical:)  he blamed him, or reproved him, much. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The acting<br>\
ill, or corruptly; doing evil, or mischief; creating<br>\
confusion, or disorder. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also said<br>\
in the K to be syn. with طَىٌّ, which means The<br>\
building [or casing a well] with stones: but [SM<br>\
says,] I fear that this is a mistranscription for<br>\
تَثْوِيبٌ, with و. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَثْرَبَ He (a ram) increased in his fatness: (K:)<br>\
or acquired a ثَرْب, having increased in fatness.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 2, in two places.<br>\
ثَرْبٌ A thin integument of fat that covers the<br>\
stomach of a ruminant and the bowels or intestines; (Lth, T, S, M, Msb, K;) the fat that is<br>\
spread over the bowels, or intestines: (T:) pl. (of<br>\
mult., TA) ثُرُوبٌ (M, K) and (of pauc., TA)<br>\
أَثْرُبٌ, and pl. pl. أَثَارِبُ. (K.) Hence, صَارَتِ<br>\
الشَّمْسُ كَالْأَثَارِبِ The sun [upon the ground] became like the integuments above-mentioned: i. e.,<br>\
scattered; being upon one place and not upon<br>\
another, towards sunset: a phrase occurring in a<br>\
trad., in which it is said that when this is the<br>\
case, it is forbidden to perform the afternoonprayer: and in another trad. occurs the phrase,<br>\
صَارَتِ الشَّمْسُ كَثَرْبِ النَّاقَةِ [The sun upon the<br>\
ground became like the ثرب of the she-camel].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A land of which the<br>\
stones are such as those of the حَرَّة [q. v.], save<br>\
that they are white. (L.)<br>\
ثَرَبَاتٌ, (K,) or ثَرِبَاتٌ [like تَرِبَاتٌ, with which<br>\
it is nearly, or perhaps exactly, syn.], (M,) The<br>\
fingers. (M, K.)<br>\
أَثْرَبُ, (TA,) fem. ثَرْبَآءُ, (T, K,) A sheep having<br>\
a large ثَرْب; (T, TA;) i. e. (TA) a fat sheep.<br>\

مُثْرِبٌ (assumed tropical:)  One who gives little, (K, TA,) reproaching for that which he has given. (TA.)<br>\
مُثَرِّبٌ Upbraiding [&amp;c.: see the verb, 2]: (M:)<br>\
or acting ill, or corruptly; doing evil, or mischief;<br>\
creating confusion, or disorder. (M, K.)<br>\
