ثَغَرَهُ, (T, A, K,) aor.<br>\
ثَغَرَ, (K,) inf. n. ثَغْرٌ,<br>\
(T,) He broke it; (T, A;) namely, a part of a<br>\
wall; (A;) he demolished it: this is [said to be]<br>\
the primary signification: he demolished it, or<br>\
pulled it down; namely, a wall: (T:) and he<br>\
broke it (namely, anything, [as a wall and a<br>\
vessel, &amp;c.,] A) so as to make a gap in it, or a<br>\
hollow in its edge. (A, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (IAar, S,<br>\
Msb, K,) aor. as above, (Msb, K,) He broke his<br>\
ثَغْر [or front teeth], (S, Msb, K,) or his teeth.<br>\
(IAar, and TA as from the K.) And ثُغِرَ, in the<br>\
pass. form, inf. n. ثُغُورٌ, He (a boy) had his ثَغْر<br>\
[or front teeth] broken. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ثَغَرْتُ سِنَّهُ I<br>\
pulled out his tooth. (El-Hujeymee, TA.) And<br>\
ثُغِرَ He (a man) had a tooth, or teeth, pulled out.<br>\
(As, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also ثُغِرَ, (AZ, S, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. ثَغْرٌ, (AZ, Msb,) He (a boy) shed his central milk-teeth, (AZ, S, Mgh, K,) or his ثَغْر [or<br>\
front teeth]: (AZ, Msb:) or ↓ أَثْغَرَ has this latter<br>\
meaning, (A, K,) or ↓ اِتَّغَرَ; (As, TA;) and ثَغِرَ,<br>\
(K,) or ↓ اِتَّغَرَ, (Sh, TA,) or ↓ اِتَّغَرَ, (Msb,) signifies he shed his teeth: (Sh, Msb, K:) ثُغِرَ is said<br>\
to have this last signification in the Kifáyet el-Mutahaffidh; and ↓ اثّغر and ↓ اتّغر are there said<br>\
to have the contr. signification, explained below<br>\
[see 8]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  ثُغِرَ also signifies He had his<br>\
mouth bruised; and so ↓ أُثْغِرَ. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  ثَغَرَ الثُّلْمَةَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
ثَغَرَ, He stopped up, or obstructed, the gap, or<br>\
breach: thus the verb bears two contr. significations. (K.) And ثَغَرْنَاهُمْ We stopped up, or<br>\
obstructed, against them the gaps, or passes of the<br>\
mountain; (S, TA;) we stopped up, or obstructed,<br>\
against them the place of exit, so that they knew<br>\
not what way to take. (A.)<br>\

inf. n. إِكْرَامٌ, he grew his ثَغْر [or front teeth]<br>\
after the former ones had fallen out: by some,<br>\
اثّغر and اتّغر are used specially in relation to a<br>\

not in relation to a boy. (Msb.) ―<br>\
