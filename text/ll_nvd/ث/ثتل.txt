He feigned himself stupid after feigning himself<br>\

(تَغَافُل being put in the place of تَعَاقُل:) [app.<br>\

horns have branches: (T, Mgh: *) he says that<br>\
the وعول are dusky, or dingy, or of a hue inclining<br>\
to black and dust-colour, with whiteness in their<br>\
lower parts; and the ثَيَاتِل [pl. of ثَيْتَل] are like<br>\
them in their colours, and only distinguished from<br>\
them by the horns; the وعل having long horns,<br>\
which extend backwards until they meet over his<br>\
tail: (T:) also a species of [the bovine antelope<br>\
called] بَقَرُ الوَحْشِ, (M, K,) that abides in the<br>\
mountains. (M.) ―<br>\
