ثُئِبَ, (&#39;Eyn, T, M, K,) like عُنِىBَ, (K,) and<br>\
ثَئِبَ, (IKoot, L, and so in a copy of the A,)<br>\
inf. n. ثَأْبٌ, (K,) or ثَأَبٌ, (M,) He became relaxed<br>\
and sluggish; said of a man: (A:) or he became<br>\
affected with sluggishness and languor; (M;) as<br>\
also ↓ تثآءب: (M, A:) or he became affected with<br>\
sluggishness and languor like the languor of drowsiness; as also ↓ تثآءب and ↓ تثأّب; (K;) which<br>\
last is approved by IDrd and Thábit Es-Sara-<br>\
kustee, who disallow ↓ تثآءب, though this is the<br>\
form commonly known and approved, and is the<br>\
most chaste form: (TA:) or he became affected<br>\
with languor like the heaviness of drowsiness, in<br>\
consequence of something that he had eaten or<br>\
drunk, without becoming insensible; (T;) as also<br>\
↓ تثآءب: (L:) or ↓ this last signifies he yawned, or<br>\
opened his mouth, (Mgh, Msb,) by reason, (Mgh,)<br>\
or on the occasion, (Msb,) of languor (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) like the heaviness of drowsiness; (Mgh;)<br>\
or he yawned, or opened his mouth, and stretched<br>\
himself, on being affected by sluggishness or drowsiness or anxiety; (MF, TA, on the authority of<br>\
IDrst;) or he yawned, or opened his mouth, and<br>\
emitted wind from his stomach, by reason of some<br>\
affection thereof: (TA on the authority of EtTedmuree:) التَّثَاؤُبُ is from الثُّؤَبَآءُ; (AZ, T, S,<br>\
Mgh;) and is on the occasion of one&#39;s stretching<br>\
himself, and being languid: (Lth, T:) one should<br>\
not say تَثَاوَبَ; (AZ, T, S, O, Mgh;) [for] this is<br>\
vulgar. (Msb.) Hence, أَحَدُكُمْ فَلْيُغَطِّ ↓ إِذَا تَثَأَءَبَ<br>\
فَاهُ [When any one of you yawns, he should cover<br>\
his mouth with the back of his left hand; for it is<br>\
believed that the devil leaps into the uncovered<br>\
yawning mouth]. (Mgh.)<br>\

ثُؤَبَآءُ, (T, S, M, K, &amp;c.,) as also ثُؤْبَآء, accord. to<br>\
Ibn-Mis-hal, but this is strange, (TA,) is a subst.<br>\
derived from التَّثَاؤُبُ, like مُطُوَآءُ from التَّمَطِّى;<br>\
(T;) or from ثَئِبَ; and means A state of relaxation and sluggishness: (A:) or sluggishness and<br>\
languor (M, K) like the languor of drowsiness:<br>\
(K:) or languor like the heaviness of drowsiness,<br>\
in consequence of something that one has eaten or<br>\
drunk, not attended by insensibility: (T, L:) or<br>\
a yawning, or opening the mouth, by reason of<br>\
languor like the heaviness of drowsiness: (Mgh:)<br>\
or a yawning, or opening the mouth, and stretching<br>\
oneself, on being affected by sluggishness or drowsiness or anxiety: (IDrst, MF, TA:) or a yawning, or opening the mouth, and emitting wind<br>\
from the stomach, by reason of some affection<br>\
thereof. (Et-Tedmuree, TA.) Hence the prov.,<br>\
أَعْدَى مِنَ الثُّؤَبَآءِ, (S, A, TA,) and [الثُّوَبَآءِ,] without ء, as some say; (MF;) or the pronunciation<br>\
without ء  is vulgar, (IDrst, TA,) or erroneous;<br>\
(TA;) [More catching than yawning;] for when<br>\
a man yawns ( اذا تثاءب ) in the presence of others,<br>\
they become affected as he is. (TA.)<br>\
مَثْؤُوبٌ Affected with sluggishness and languor<br>\
like the languor of drowsiness: from ثُئِبَ, q. v.<br>\
