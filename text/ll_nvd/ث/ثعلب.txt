ثَعْلَبَ He (a man) was cowardly, and<br>\
eluded, or turned away, or went this way and<br>\
that, or to the right and left, quickly, and deceitfully, or guilefully; as also ↓ تَثَعْلَبَ: his doing<br>\
so being thus likened to the running of the ثَعْلَب.<br>\
(TA.) And ثعلب مِنْهُ فَرَقًا [He was cowardly,<br>\
and eluded him, or turned away from him, &amp;c.,<br>\
through fear]; i. e., from another man. (TA.)<br>\
Q. 2<br>\
تَثَعْلَبَ: see above.<br>\
ثَعْلَبٌ [The fox; canis vulpes of Linn.: but<br>\
in the dial. of Egypt, the jackal; canis aureus<br>\
of Linn.: the former animal being there called<br>\
أَبُو الحُصَيْنِ, as it often is by the Arabs of other<br>\
countries:] a certain beast of prey; (TA;) well<br>\
known: (S, K:) applied to the male and the<br>\
female; so that one says ثَعْلَبٌ ذَكَرٌ and ثَعْلَبٌ<br>\
أُنْثَى; but if one would designate the male by a<br>\
single word applying to it only, he says ↓ ثُعْلُبَانٌ,<br>\
with damm to the ث and ل: (IAmb, Msb:)<br>\
or the former applies to the female: (K:) or the<br>\
female is called ↓ ثَعْلَبَةٌ; (Ks, S, Msb, K;) and<br>\
the male, ↓ ثُعْلُبَانٌ (Ks, S, K) and ثَعْلَبٌ, (K,)<br>\
[accord. to some,] like as one says عَقْرَبَةٌ [and<br>\
عُقْرُبَانٌ] and عَقْرَبٌ: (Msb:) or ثَعْلَبٌ is the male;<br>\
and the female is called ↓ ثُعَالَةُ: (Az, TA: [but see<br>\
this word is art. ثعل:]) the pl. of ثعلب is ثَعَالِبُ<br>\
and ثَعَالٍ, (K,) accord. to Lh: but ISd disapproves of this [latter pl.]; and Sb does not<br>\
allow it except in poetry. (TA.) F charges J<br>\
with error in citing, as a proof that ↓ ثُعْلُبَانٌ signifies the male, the following verse:<br>\
أَرَبٌّ يَبُولُ الثُّعْلُبَانُ بِرَأْسِهِ<br>\
لَقَدْ ذَلَّ مَنْ بَالَتْ عَلَيْهِ الثَّعَالِبُ<br>\
[Is he a Lord, upon whose head the he-fox makes<br>\
water? (the ب in برأسه being syn. with عَلَى:<br>\
so in the Mughnee, in art. ب:) Vile indeed is he<br>\
upon whom the foxes make water!] said by a man<br>\
who was keeper of an idol, on seeing a he-fox<br>\
make water upon it: but in this, F opposes also<br>\
Ks and others; and it is asserted by several authorities that the correct reading of the word ثعلبان<br>\
in a trad. whereby F attempts to establish his<br>\
charge against J is not ثَعْلَبَانِ, dual. of ثَعْلَبٌ,<br>\
as he pronounces it to be, but ثُعْلَبَانِ, which is<br>\
said to be the masc. of ثَعْلَبٌ, like as أُفْعُوَانٌ and<br>\
عُقْرُبَانٌ are mascs. of أَفْعًى and عَقْرَبٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
دَآءُ الثَّعْلَبِ [for which Golius seems to have found<br>\
in a copy of the K دَوَآءُ الثَّعْلَبِ] A well-known<br>\
disease, [namely, alopecia,] (S, K,) in consequence<br>\
of which the hair falls off. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عِنَبُ الثَّعْلَبِ<br>\
[Fox-grape: rendered by Golius “ uvæ vulpinæ,<br>\
i. e. solanum: ” but now applied by some to the<br>\
gooseberry: and the solanum nigrum, or gardennightshade, is now commonly called عِنَبُ الذِّئْبِ:]<br>\
a certain astringent, cooling plant: seven (or,<br>\
as in one copy of the K, nine) حَبَّات [which here<br>\
seems to mean berries] thereof, swallowed, are<br>\
a cure for the jaundice (اليَرَقَان), and stop pregnancy, (K, TA,) like the berries of the خِرْوَع [or<br>\
castor-oil-plant], for the year, or, as some say,<br>\
absolutely. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  A hole, or aperture, (جُحْر,)<br>\
whence rain-water flows. (TA.) [And particularly,] The outlet, hole, or aperture, (مَخْرَج, S<br>\
and Msb, or جُحْر, K, or ثَقْب, TA,) whence the<br>\
rain-water flows from the place where dates are<br>\
dried. (S, Msb, K, TA.) And The place whence<br>\
the water flows forth (L, K) from, (L, TA,) or<br>\
to, (K, [probably a mistake,]) a watering-trough<br>\
or tank. (L, K.)<br>\
-A3-  The upper extremity of a<br>\
spear-shaft that enters into the head thereof. (S,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The lowest part of a palm-shoot when it is<br>\
cut from [the root of] the mother-tree: or the<br>\
lowest part of a [shoot such as is termed] راكُوب,<br>\
on the trunk of a palm-tree. (AA, K.)<br>\
ثَعْلَبَةٌ: see ثَعْلَبٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also The os coccygis, or<br>\
tail-bone; syn. عُصْعُصٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The podex,<br>\
or the anus; syn. اِسْتٌ. (K.)<br>\
ثُعْلُبَانٌ: see ثَعْلَبٌ, in three places.<br>\
ثَعْلَبِيَّةٌ A running of the horse like the running<br>\
of the dog. (K.)<br>\
ثْعَالَةُ: see ثَعْلَبٌ, and see art. ثعل.<br>\
أَرْضٌ مُثَعْلِبَةٌ A land having ثَعَالِب [or foxes]:<br>\
(S:) or, having many thereof; as also أَرضٌ مَثْعَلَةٌ;<br>\
(K;) which is from ثُعَالَةٌ; or it may be from<br>\
ثَعْلَبٌ, like مَعْقَرَةٌ applied to “ a land having many<br>\
عَقَارِب [or scorpions]. ” (S, L.)<br>\
