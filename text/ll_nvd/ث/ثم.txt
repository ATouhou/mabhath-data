ثَمَّهُ, (S, M, * K,) aor.<br>\
ثَمُ3َ, (S, M,) inf. n. ثَمٌّ,<br>\
(T, S, M,) He repaired it; or put it into a good,<br>\
sound, or right, state; (T, S, M, K;) [by filling<br>\
up its interstices, &amp;c.,] with ثُمَام [q. v.]. (S.)<br>\
Hence the saying, ثَمَمْتُ أُمُورِى (assumed tropical:)  I put my<br>\
affairs into a good, sound, right, or proper,<br>\
state; restored them to such a state; or set them<br>\
right, or in order. (S.) And hence also the<br>\
saying, كُنَّا أَهْلَ ثَمِّهِ وَرَمِّهِ (assumed tropical:)  [We were the fit<br>\
persons to put it into a good, sound, right, or<br>\
proper, state; &amp;c.]; (S;) occurring in a trad.;<br>\
accord. to the relaters thereof, وَرُمِّهِ ↓ ثُمِّهِ; but<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd holds the former reading to be the<br>\
right. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He spread ثُمَام for it, namely, a<br>\
skin of milk, and put it [ثمام] above it, in order<br>\
that the sun might not strike it, and its milk<br>\
become consequently decomposed, or curdled. (T.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [He stuffed it, either with ثُمَام or absolutely:<br>\
for] ثُمَّ signifies it was stuffed. (T.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He collected it together; (S, M, K;) namely, a thing;<br>\
(S, M;) mostly used in relation to dry herbage.<br>\
(M, K.) You say, ثُمَّ لَهَا, i. e. Collect thou [for<br>\
them; namely, the cattle &amp;c.; like ثِمْ لَهَا from<br>\
وَثَمَ]. (TA.) And هُوَ يَثُمُّهُ وَيَقُمُّهُ He sweeps it,<br>\
and collects the good and the bad. (S.) ―<br>\
-b5-  ثَمَّ الطَّعَامَ,<br>\
(M, K,) [aor. and] inf. n. as above, (M,) He ate<br>\
the good of the food and the bad thereof; (M,<br>\
K;) as also قَمَّهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  ثَمَّتْةُ, (T, * S, M, K,)<br>\
aor. and inf. n. as above, (M,) She (a ewe or a<br>\
goat, M, K, or, as some say, only the latter, M)<br>\
pulled it, or plucked it, up, or out, with her<br>\
mouth; (T, S, M, K;) namely, a thing, (T, M,)<br>\
or a plant, (S, K,) and anything by which she<br>\
passed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  ثَمَّ يَدَهُ بِالحَشِيشِ, (M, K,) or<br>\
بِالأَرْضِ, (S, M,) [aor. and] inf. n. as above, (TA,)<br>\
He wiped his hand (S, M, K) with the dry herbage, (M, K,) or upon the ground. (S, M.)<br>\
ثَمَّ There; syn. هُنَاكَ; (Zj, S, M, K;) a noun<br>\
of indication, (Zj, T, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) denoting a place that is remote (Zj, T, S, M, Mughnee, K) from the speaker, (Zj, T, M,) like as هُنَا<br>\
denotes that which is near; (Zj, T, S;) or denoting<br>\
a place other than that of the speaker: (Msb:)<br>\
it is an adverbial noun, not to be used otherwise<br>\
than as such; (Mughnee, K;) indecl. because of<br>\
its vagueness, and with fet-h for its termination<br>\
to avoid the concurrence of two quiescent letters.<br>\
(Zj, T, M.) Thus in the saying [in the Kur<br>\
xxvi. 64], وَأَزْلَفْنَا ثَمَّ الآخَرِينَ [And we brought<br>\
near, there, the others]. (Mughnee.) He who<br>\
makes it decl. as an objective complement (Mughnee, K) in this ex., (Mughnee,) and in the saying<br>\
in the Kur [lxxvi. 20], وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ ثَمَّ رَأَيْتَ نَعِيمًا,<br>\
is in error: (Mughnee, K: *) Zj says that the<br>\
meaning is, And when thou castest thine eyes, or<br>\
thy sight, there, thou shalt behold [scenes of]<br>\
enjoyment: that Fr asserted the meaning to be,<br>\
إِذَا رَأَيْتَ مَا ثَمَّ [when thou seest what is there];<br>\
but that this is an error; for ما, accord. to this<br>\
interpretation, is a conjunct noun, and it is not<br>\
allowable to suppress a conjunct noun and leave<br>\
its complement. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [مِنْ ثَمَّ is used by postclassical writers as meaning Therefore; for that<br>\
reason; on that account.]<br>\
ثُمَّ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) for which one also says فُمَّ,<br>\
(M, Mughnee,) substituting ف for the ث, (M,)<br>\
and ثُمَّتَ (T, S, M) and ثُمَّتْ, (M, TA,) but ثُمَّتَ<br>\
is the more common, (Mughnee and K on the<br>\
letter ت,) and فُمَّتَ and فُمَّتْ, (M, TA,) [meaning Then, i. e., afterward, or afterwards,] a<br>\
particle, (M, K,) or conjunction, (Zj, T, S, Msb,<br>\
Mughnee,) denoting order (Zj, T, S, M, Msb,<br>\
Mughnee) and a delay, (S, Msb,) or having three<br>\
properties, namely, that of virtually associating<br>\
in the same case [the latter of the two members<br>\
which it conjoins with the former of them], and<br>\
denoting order, and denoting a delay; but respecting all of these there is a difference of opinions.<br>\
(Mughnee, K. *) As to the associating in the<br>\
same case, Akh and the Koofees assert that it<br>\
sometimes fails to have this property, by its<br>\
occurring redundantly, so as not to be a conjunction at all; and they hold to accord with<br>\
this assertion the saying in the Kur [ix. 119],<br>\
حَتَّى إِذَا ضَاقَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الْأَرْضُ بِمَا رَحُبَتْ وَضَاقَتْ<br>\
عَلَيْهِمْ أَنْفُسُهُمْ وَظَنُّوا أَنْ لَا مَلْجَأَ مِنَ اللّٰهِ إِلَّا إِلَيْهِ ثُمَّ<br>\
تَابَ عَلَيْهِمْ [Until, when the earth became strait<br>\
to them, notwithstanding its amplitude, and their<br>\
minds became straitened to them, and they knew<br>\
that there was no repairing for refuge from God<br>\
save unto Him, then He returned to forgiveness<br>\
towards them]: (Mughnee, K: *) but this has<br>\
been resolved by the subaudition of the complement [of what precedes ثُمَّ, as though the meaning<br>\
were, then (they betook themselves unto Him,<br>\
begging forgiveness, and) He returned &amp;c.].<br>\
(Mughnee.) And as to its denoting order, some<br>\
hold that there are exs. of its not necessarily<br>\
implying this; (Mughnee, K; *) one of which is<br>\
the saying in the Kur [xxxix. 8], خَلَقَكُمْ مِنْ نَفْسٍ<br>\
وَاحِدَةٍ ثُمَّ جَعَلَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا: (Mughnee: [in which<br>\
are added other similar exs., one of which is given<br>\
in the K:]) but to this there are five replies: 1st,<br>\
that this passage is elliptical; the meaning being,<br>\
He created you from one person (which He<br>\
originated); then He made therefrom its mate:<br>\
2nd, that the meaning is, He created you from a<br>\
person that was alone; then &amp;c.: 3rd, that the<br>\
progeny of Adam were made to come forth from<br>\
his back like little ants; then Eve was created<br>\
from his [rib called the] قُصَيْرَى: 4th, that the<br>\
creation of Eve from Adam being unusual, ثمّ is<br>\
used to notify its order and posteriority in respect<br>\
of wonderfulness and of the manifestation of<br>\
power; not to denote order and posteriority of<br>\
time: 5th, that ثمّ is here used to denote the<br>\
order of enunciation; not the virtual order: the<br>\
replies preceding this last are better than it, inasmuch as they verify the order and the delay;<br>\
whereas the last verifies the order only, as there<br>\
is no delay between the two enunciations; but the<br>\
last reply is of more common application, applying<br>\
to the ex. given above and to others: (Mughnee:)<br>\
Fr says that the meaning of the ex. given above<br>\
is, He created you from a person (which He<br>\
created) single; then &amp;c.; and in like manner<br>\
says Zj. (T.) And as to its denoting a delay,<br>\
Fr asserts that sometimes this is not the case, as<br>\
is shown by the saying, أَعْجَبَنِى مَا صَنَعْتَ اليَوْمَ<br>\
ثُمَّ مَا صَنَعْتَ أَمْسِ أَعْجَبُ [What thou didst to-day<br>\
excited my wonder, or admiration, or pleasure;<br>\
then (I tell thee) what thou didst yesterday was<br>\
more wonderful, or admirable, or pleasing]; for<br>\
ثمّ is here used to denote the order of the enunciation; not a delay between the two enunciations.<br>\
(Mughnee, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is said that] it denotes<br>\
order and a delay when it conjoins single words:<br>\
but Akh says that it has the meaning of وَ [And],<br>\
because it is used in cases in which there is no<br>\
order; as in وَاللّٰهِ ثُمَّ وَاللّٰهِ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ [By God, and<br>\
(I say again,) By God, I will assuredly do such<br>\
a thing]: and when it conjoins propositions, it<br>\
does not necessarily denote order, but has the<br>\
meaning of وَ: (Msb:) it has the meaning of وَ,<br>\
(S, Msb,) the conjunction, (S,) in the saying in<br>\
the Kur [x. 47], ثُمَّ اللّٰهُ شَهِيدٌ عَلَى مَا يَفْعَلُونَ<br>\
[And God is witness of what they do]. (S,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The Koofees allow its being used in the<br>\
manner of فَ and وَ so as that the aor. immediately<br>\
following it after a conditional verb may be man-<br>\
soob: and Ibn-Málik allows its being thus used<br>\
so as that the aor. immediately following it after<br>\
the expression of a desire that the thing shall not<br>\
be done may be marfooa and mejzoom and man-<br>\
soob. (Mughnee.)<br>\
ثُمٌّ: see ثُمَامٌ.<br>\
-A2-  In the saying مَا لَهُ ثُمٌّ وَلَا رُمُّ<br>\
[He has not ثُمّ nor رُمّ], the former of these two<br>\
nouns signifies water-skins, or milk-skins, and<br>\
vessels; (M;) or what is bad, or the worst, of<br>\
those things, (S, K,) accord. to ISk; (S;) or<br>\
men&#39;s household-goods, or furniture and utensils,<br>\
and their water-skins, or milk-skins, and vessels;<br>\
(T, TA;) which last is the right meaning: (TA:)<br>\
and the latter noun signifies مَرَمَّةُ البَيْتِ [app.<br>\
meaning, accord. to analogy, (for I find no suitable explanation of it in any of the lexicons,) the<br>\
means by which a house, or tent, is put into a<br>\
good state; and therefore, good furniture and<br>\
utensils]. (ISk, S, M, K.) You say also, مَا يَمْلِكُ<br>\
ثُمًّا وَلَا رُمًّا, meaning the same: (S, TA:) or he<br>\
possesses not little nor much: it is not used save<br>\
with a negation. (M, TA.) An Arab of the<br>\
desert said, جَعْجَعَ بِىَ الدَّهْرُ عَنْ ثُمِّهِ وَرُمِّهِ, [thus<br>\
in some copies of the S, and in the TA, in which<br>\
latter the last two nouns are expressly said to be<br>\
with damm, but in two copies of the S, in this<br>\
instance, erroneously written, ثَمِّهِ وَرَمِّهِ,] i. e.<br>\
[Fortune has debarred me] from its little and its<br>\
much. (S, TA.) And hence the saying of the<br>\
vulgar, جَآءَ بِالثُّمِّ وَالرُّمِّ, except that they pronounce both these nouns with kesr, meaning He<br>\
brought little and much. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1.<br>\
ثَمَّةٌ: see ثُمَامٌ.<br>\
ثُمَّةٌ A handful of dry herbage. (S, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also n. un. of ثُمٌّ, which is syn. with ثُمَامٌ: see<br>\
the next paragraph in six places.<br>\
ثُمَامٌ [Panicum, or panic grass; applied to<br>\
several species thereof; but restricted by Forskål<br>\
(Flor. Aeg. Ar., descr. plant., p. 20, where its<br>\
Arabic name is written “ tummâm,” ) to panicum<br>\
dichotomum; called by Delile (Flor. Aeg., no. 58,<br>\
where its Arabic name is written “ temâm,” )<br>\
pennisetum dichotomum; and described by him<br>\
in the “ explication des planches ” accompanying<br>\
his Flora, plate 8: the Arabs use it for making<br>\
thatch for their huts:] a kind of plant, (T, S,<br>\
Msb, K, [in the M termed شَجَرٌ,]) well known in<br>\
the desert, not desired, or not much eaten, by the<br>\
camels, or cattle, except in a case of scarcity, or<br>\
drought; (T;) weak, or frail; having what are<br>\
termed خُوص [q. v.], or what resemble خوص,<br>\
sometimes used for stuffing, (S, TA,) and for<br>\
stopping up the interstices of houses; (S, Msb,<br>\
TA;) and sometimes used for removing whiteness<br>\
from the eye: (K:) accord. to Az, it is of several<br>\
species, one of which is the ضَعَة, and another is<br>\
the جَلِيلَة, and another is the غَرَف, which resembles<br>\
rushes (أُسَل), and brooms are made of it, and<br>\
water-bags are covered with it to protect them<br>\
from the sun, causing the water to become cool:<br>\
(TA:) [see also أُمْصُوخَةٌ:] it is also called ↓ ثَيْمُومٌ,<br>\
(K,) and ↓, [but see what follows,] (T, M,)<br>\
which is sometimes contracted into ثُمَةٌ; (T;) or<br>\
it is also called ↓ ثُمٌّ, of which ↓ ثُمَّةٌ is the n. un.:<br>\
(AHn, TA:) the n. un. of ثُمَامٌ is [likewise] with ة.<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K.) You say of a thing that may be<br>\
reached, or taken with the hand, without difficulty,<br>\
(T, Z, K,) هُوَ عَلَى طَرَفِ الثُّمَامِ, (IAar, T, M, Z,<br>\
K, *,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  It is easy to thee, or within thy reach,<br>\
no obstacle intervening between thee and it: (IAar,<br>\
M:) because the ثمام is not tall, (T, K,) so that<br>\
the reaching it should be difficult. (T.) And<br>\
↓ هُوَ لَكَ عَلَى رَأْسِ الثُّمَّةِ [meaning the same].<br>\
(M.) And ↓ هُوَ عَلَى رَأْسِ الثُّمَّةِ, (TA,) or لَكَ ذٰلِكَ<br>\
↓ عَلَى رَأْسِ الثُّمَّةِ, (assumed tropical:)  [That is easy of attainment to<br>\
thee], (M,) is a prov. used in relation to the<br>\
attainment of a thing that one wants. (M, TA.)<br>\
The Arabs also say, ↓ هُوَ أَبُوهُ عَلَى طَرَفِ الثُّمَّةِ,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He is like his father: and some of<br>\
them say ↓ الثَّمَّة, with fet-h. (TA.) And it is<br>\
said in a trad. of &#39;Omar, اُغْزُوا وَالغَزْوُ حُلْوٌ خَضِرٌ<br>\
قَبْلَ أَنْ يَصِيرَ ثُمَامًا ثُمَّ رُمَامًا ثُمَّ حُطَامًا (assumed tropical:)  [Engage<br>\
ye in predatory warfare while it is sweet and<br>\
fresh], meaning, while ye see, and make abundant,<br>\
your spoils, before it become feeble like the ثمام;<br>\
[then, decayed; then, broken up.] (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It<br>\
also signifies What has become dry, or dried up,<br>\
of the branches that are placed beneath the نَضَد<br>\
[q. v.]. (M.)<br>\
ثَمُومٌ A sheep (T, S, M, K) or goat (S, M, K)<br>\
that pulls, or plucks, up, or out, with her mouth,<br>\
(T, S, M, K,) a thing, (T, M,) or a plant: (S,<br>\

and lends a beast or camel for riding or carrying,<br>\
to him who has no beast or camel for riding or<br>\
carrying (يُفْقِرُ مَنْ لَا ظَهْرَ لَهُ, [in the CK, erroneously, يَفْقِرُ,]) and sets right (يَثُمُّ [in the<br>\

by ISh. (T.) And A man who is strong; who<br>\
comes after, and aids, those who have recourse<br>\

(T.) And رَجُلٌ مِعَمٌّ مِثَمٌّ مِلَمٌّ A man who sets<br>\
right an affair, and manages it, or acts vigorously<br>\
in it. (IAar, T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَجُلٌ مِثَمٌّ وَمِقَمٌّ and ↓ مِثَمَّةٌ<br>\
وَمِقَمَّةٌ, (S, K,) in which latter phrase the ة is<br>\
added to give intensiveness to the signification,<br>\
(S,) A man who sweeps and collects the good and<br>\
