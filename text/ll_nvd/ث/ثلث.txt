ثَلَثَ, aor.<br>\
ثَلِثَ, [but in this case it seems that it<br>\
should be<br>\
ثَلُثَ, as above,] is also said to signify He<br>\
slew a third. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ثَلَثَ القَوْمَ, (T, S, K,) or<br>\

ثَلِثَ,<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K,) [thus distinguished from the<br>\

two, (Fr, T, M,) or to the two men: (Msb:) or<br>\
he made them, with himself, three: (T, S, K:)<br>\

and أَسْبَعُهُمْ and أَتْسَعُهُمْ, with fet-h, because of the<br>\
ع. (S.) A poet says, (IAar, S,) namely, AbdAllah Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr El-Asadee, satirizing the<br>\
tribe of Teiyi, (IB, TA,)<br>\
فَإِنْ تَثْلِثُوا نَرْبَعْ وَإِنْ يَكُ خَامِسٌ<br>\
يَكُنْ سَادِسٌ حَتَّى يُبِيرَكُمُ القَتْلُ<br>\

make up the number of four; and if there be<br>\
a fifth of you, there shall be a sixth of us; so<br>\

-b4-<br>\
ثَلَثَ الأَرْضَ He turned over the ground three<br>\
times for sowing, or cultivating. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
See also 2. ―<br>\
-b6-  ثَلَثَ, (T, M, L, TA,) [as though<br>\
intrans., an objective complement being app. understood,] or ↓ ثلّث, (K, [but the former is app.<br>\
the right reading, unless both be correct,]) said<br>\
of a horse, He came [third in the race; i. e.,<br>\
next] after that which is called المُصَلِّى: (T, M,<br>\
L, K: [in the CK, الذى, after الفَرَسُ, should be<br>\
omitted:]) then you say رَبَعَ: then, خَمَسَ. (T,<br>\
M, L.) And in like manner it is said of a man<br>\
[as meaning He came third]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b7-  لَا يَثْنِى<br>\

or ↓ لَا يُثْنِى وَلَا يُثْلِثُ, (so in a copy of the K in<br>\
art. ثنى, [in the TA, in the present art. and in<br>\
art. ثنى, without any syll. signs,]) said of an old<br>\
man, meaning He cannot rise, (M, A, TA,) when<br>\
he desires to do so, a first time, nor can he (M,<br>\
TA) the second time, nor the third. (M, A, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
ثلّثهُ He made it three; or called it three:<br>\
(Esh-Sheybánee, and K in art. وحد:) تَثْلِيثٌ<br>\
signifies the making [a thing] three [by addition<br>\
or multiplication or division]; as also ↓ ثَلْثٌ<br>\
[inf. n. of ثَلَثَ]: and the calling [it] three. (KL.)<br>\

doctrine of the Trinity.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] فُلَانٌ<br>\
يُثَنِّى وَلَا يُثَلِّثُ Such a one counts two Khaleefehs,<br>\

Such a one counts three Khaleefehs, [namely,<br>\

three of the teats of his she-camel with the صِرَار.<br>\

اثلث القَوْمُ The party of men became three:<br>\
(Th, S, M, L, K:) and similar to this are the<br>\
other verbs of number, to ten [inclusive]: (S:)<br>\
also The party of men became thirty: and so in<br>\
the cases of other numbers, to a hundred [exclusive]. (M, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اثلثت She (a camel, and any<br>\
female,) brought forth her third young one, or<br>\
offspring; (Th, M;) and so ↓ ثلّثت, or ↓ اثتلثت.<br>\
(TA in art. بكر.) ―<br>\
-b3-  لَا يُثْنِى وَلَا يُثْلِثُ: see 1. ―<br>\

إِثْتَلَثَ see 4.<br>\
ثُلْثٌ: see ثُلُثٌ.<br>\
ثِلْثٌ The third young one or offspring, (M, A,<br>\
K,) of a she-camel, (M, K,) and, accord, to Th,<br>\
of any female: (M:) and in like manner others<br>\
are termed, to ten [inclusive]. (A.) But one<br>\
should not say نَاقَةٌ ثِلْثٌ [after the manner of ثِنْىٌ,<br>\
q. v.]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سَقَى نَخْلَهُ الثِّلْثَ He watered<br>\
his palm-trees once in three days: (A:) or he<br>\
watered them بَعْدَ الثُّنْيَا [which app. means after<br>\
excepting, or omitting, one day]. (K.) ثِلْثٌ is<br>\
not used [thus] except in this case: there is no<br>\
ثِلْث in the watering of camels; for the shortest<br>\
period of watering is the رِفْه when the camels<br>\
drink every day; then is the غِبّ, which is when<br>\
they come to the water one day and not the next<br>\
day; and next after this is the رِبْع; then, the<br>\
خِمْس; and so on to the عِشْر: so says As: (S,<br>\
TA:) and this is correct, though J&#39;s assertion<br>\
that ثِلْث is not used except in this case is said by<br>\
F to require consideration. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  حُمَّى الثِّلْثِ<br>\
i. q. حُمَّى الغِبِّ, [The tertian fever;] the fever<br>\
that attacks one day and intermits one day and<br>\
attacks again on the third day; called by the<br>\
vulgar ↓ المُثَلِّثَةُ. (Msb.)<br>\
ثُلَثٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
ثُلُثٌ (T, S, M, A, Msb, K) and ↓ ثُلْثٌ (Msb,<br>\
K) and ↓ ثُلَثٌ, which last is either a dial. var. or<br>\
is so pronounced to make the utterance more easy,<br>\
(MF,) A third; a third part or portion; (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K;) as also ↓ ثَلِيتٌ, (As, T, S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
like ثَمِينٌ and سَبِيعٌ and سَدِيسٌ and خَمِيسٌ and<br>\
نَصِيفٌ, (S,) though AZ ignored ثَلِيثٌ (T, S) and<br>\
خَمِيسٌ: (S:) [and ↓ مِثْلَاثٌ, q. v., app, signifies<br>\
the same:] the pl. of ثلث, (M, Msb,) and of<br>\
ثليث also, (M,) is أَثْلَاثٌ. (M, Msb.) It is said<br>\
in a trad., دِيَةُ شِبْهِ العَمْدِ أَثْلَاثًا [The expiatory<br>\
mulct for that homicide which resembles what is<br>\
intentional shall be thirds]; i. e., thirty-three<br>\
she-camels each such as is termed حِقَّة, and thirtythree of which each is such as is termed جَذَعَة,<br>\
and thirty-four of which each is what is termed<br>\
ثَنِيَّة. (TA.)<br>\
إِنَآءٌ ثَلْثَانُ A vessel in which the corn &amp;c. that is<br>\
measured therein reaches to one third of it: and<br>\
in like manner one uses this expression in relation<br>\
to beverage, or wine, &amp;c. (M, L.)<br>\
ثِلْثَانٌ, (so in a copy of the M,) or ثَلِثَانٌ, and<br>\
ثَلَثَانٌ, (K,) I. q. عِنَبُ الثَّعْلَبِ; (K;) the tree<br>\
thus called. (M, TA.)<br>\
ثَلَاثٌ, also written ثَلٰثٌ: see ثَلَاثَةٌ, in six places:<br>\
and ثُلَاثُ, in two places.<br>\
ثُلَاثُ and ↓ مَثْلَثُ (S, L, K) Three and three;<br>\
three and three together; or three at a time and<br>\
three at a time; (L;) imperfectly decl. [because]<br>\
changed from the original form of ثَلَاثَةٌ ثَلَاثَةٌ;<br>\
(K;) or because of their having the quality of<br>\
epithets and deviating from the original form of<br>\
ثَلَاثَةٌ: they are epithets; for you say, مَرَرْتُ بِقَوْمٍ<br>\
مَثْنَى وَثُلَاثَ [I passed by a party of men two and<br>\
two, and three and three, together]: (Sb, S:) or<br>\
they are imperfectly decl. because they deviate<br>\
from their original as to the letter and the meaning; the original word being changed as above<br>\
stated, and the meaning being changed to ثَلَاثَةٌ<br>\
ثَلَاثَةٌ: but the dim. is ↓ ثُلَيِّثٌ, perfectly decl., like<br>\
أُحَيِّدٌ &amp;c., because it is like حُمَيِّرٌ [dim. of حِمَارٌ],<br>\
assuming the form of that which is perfectly decl.,<br>\
though it is not so in the cases of أَحْسَنُ and the<br>\
like, as these words, in assuming the dim. form,<br>\
do not deviate from the measure of a verb, for<br>\
مَا أُحَيْسِنَهُ [How goodly is he!] is sometimes said.<br>\
(S.) It is said in the Kur [iv. 3], فَانْكِحُوا مَا طَابَ<br>\
لَكُمْ مِنَ النِّسَآءِ وَثُلَاثَ وَرُبَاعَ, i. e. Then marry<br>\
ye such as please you, of women, two [and] two,<br>\
and three [and] three, and four [and] four:<br>\
[meaning, two at a time, &amp;c.:] here مثنى &amp;c.<br>\
are imperfectly decl. because deviating from the<br>\
original form of اِثْنَيْنِ اِثْنَيْنِ, &amp;c., and from the<br>\
fem. form. (Zj, T, L.) And one says ↓ مَثْلَثَ مَثْلَثَ,<br>\
like ثُلَاثَ ثُلَاثَ. (T.) You say also, فَعَلْتُ الشَّىْءَ<br>\
مَثْنَى وَثُلَاثَ وَرُبَاعَ, meaning I did the thing twice<br>\
and twice, and thrice and thrice, and four times<br>\
and four times. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [ثُلَاثٌ is app. fem. of<br>\
ثُلَاثَةٌ, a dial, var. of ثَلَاثَةٌ, of which the fem. is<br>\
ثَلَاثٌ: and hence,] ذُو ثُلَاثٍ, with damm [to the<br>\
initial ث], A camel&#39;s [girth of the kind called]<br>\
وَضِين. (K.) You say, اِلْتَقَتْ عُرَا ذِى ثُلَاثِهَا<br>\
(tropical:)  [lit., The loops of her girth met together]; (A,<br>\
TA; [but in a copy of the former, ↓ ذى ثَلَاثِهَا;])<br>\
meaning, she was, or became, lean, or lank in the<br>\
belly. (A. [See a similar saying voce بِطَانٌ.])<br>\
And a poet says,<br>\
وَقَدْ ضَمَرَتْ حَتَّى بَدَا ذُو ثُلَاثِهَا<br>\
[And she had become lean, or lank in the belly, so<br>\
that her girth appeared]: but some say that ذو<br>\
ثلاثها [here] means her belly, and the two skins,<br>\
[namely,] the upper, and that which is pared, or<br>\
scraped off, after the flaying: (TA:) or, accord.<br>\
to some, the phrase is حَتَّى ارْتَقَى ذو ثلاثها, meaning, so that her fœtus rose to her back; the ثلاث<br>\
[here again in a copy of the A written with fet-h<br>\
to the initial ث, and in like manner ثلاثها,] being<br>\
the سَابِيَآء and the سَلَا and the womb. (A, TA.)<br>\
You say also ↓ عَلَيْهِ ذُو ثَلَاثٍ, [so I find it written,<br>\
but perhaps it should be ذو ثُلَاثٍ,] meaning,<br>\
(tropical:)  Upon him is a [garment of the kind called]<br>\
كِسَآء made of the wool of three sheep. (A, TA.<br>\
[In the latter without any syll. sign to show that<br>\
ثلاث here differs from the form in the exs. cited<br>\
before.])<br>\
ثِلَاث: see ثَالِثٌ.<br>\
ثَلُوثٌ A she-camel that fills three vessels (S,<br>\
M, A, L, K) such as are called أَقْدَاح, (M, L,)<br>\
when she is milked, (S, K,) [i. e.,] at one milking.<br>\
(A.) This is the utmost quantity that the camel<br>\
yields at one milking. (IAar, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
she-camel three of whose teats dry up: (S, M, A,<br>\
K: [accord. to the TA, it is said in the T that<br>\
such is termed ↓ مَثْلُوثٌ; but I think that this is a<br>\
mistranscription:]) or that has had one of her<br>\
teats cut off (IAar, T, M, L, K) by cauterization,<br>\
which becomes a mark to her, (IAar, M,) and<br>\
[in some copies of the K “ or ”] is milked from<br>\
three teats: (T, M, L, K:) or that has three<br>\
teats; (IAar, TA;) [and] so ↓ مُثَلِّثَةٌ: (T, TA:)<br>\
or a she-camel having one of her teats dried up<br>\
in consequence of something that has happened to<br>\
it. (ISk.)<br>\
ثَلِيثٌ: see ثُلُثٌ.<br>\
ثَلَاثَةٌ, also written ثَلٰثَةٌ, a noun of number,<br>\
[i. e. Three,] is masc., (S, M, Msb,) and is also<br>\
written and pronounced ↓ ثُلَاثَةٌ, with damm:<br>\
(IAar, M, TA:) the fem. is ↓ ثَلَاثٌ, also written<br>\
ثَلٰثٌ; (S, M, Msb;) [and app. ثُلَاثٌ also, mentioned above, under the head of ثُلَاثُ, but only as<br>\
occurring with ذُو prefixed to it.] You say ثُلَاثَةُ<br>\
رِجَالٍ [Three men]: and نِسْوَةٍ ↓ ثَلَاثُ [three<br>\
women]. (Msb.) In the saying of Mohammad,<br>\
↓ رُفِعَ القَلَمُ عَنْ ثَلَاثٍ [The pen of the recording<br>\
angel is withheld from three persons] ثلاث is for<br>\
ثَلَاثِ أَنْفُسٍ. (Msb. [See art. رفع.]) [In like<br>\
manner, ↓ ثَلَاثٌ occurs in several trads. for ثَلَاثُ<br>\
خِصَالٍ; as, for instance, in the saying,] ثَلَاثٌ مَنْ<br>\
كُنَّ فِيهِ حَاسَبَهُ اللّٰهُ حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا [There are three<br>\
qualities: in whomsoever they be, God will reckon<br>\
with him with an easy reckoning]: these are, thy<br>\
giving to him who denies thee, and forgiving him<br>\
who wrongs thee, and being kind to him who<br>\
cuts thee off from him. (El-Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer.)<br>\
The people of El-Hijáz say, أَتَوْنِى ثَلَاثَتَهُمْ [The<br>\
three of them came to me], and أَرْبَعَتَهُمْ, and so on<br>\
to ten [inclusive], with nasb in every case; and<br>\
in like manner in the fem., ↓ أَتَيْنَنِى ثَلَاثَهُنَّ, and<br>\
أَرْبَعَهُنَّ: but others decline the word with the three<br>\
vowels, making it like كُلُّهُمْ: after ten, however,<br>\
only nasb is used; so that you say, أَتَوْنِى أَحَدَ عَشَرَهُمْ<br>\
[and ثَلَاثَةَ عَشَرَهُمْ], and إِحْدَى عَشْرَتَهُنَّ [and ثَلَاثَ<br>\
عَشْرَتَهُنَّ]. (S.) The saying وَلَدُ الزِّنَا شَرٌ الثَّلَاثَةِ<br>\
means [The offspring of adultery, or fornication,<br>\
is the worst of the three] if he do the deeds of his<br>\
parents. (Mgh.) [It is said that when ثلاثة<br>\
means the things numbered, not the amount of<br>\
the number, it is imperfectly decl., being regarded<br>\
as a proper name; and so are other ns. of number. (See ثُمَانِيةٌ.) See also سِتَّةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  ثَلَاثَةَ عَشَرَ<br>\
[indecl. in every case, meaning Thirteen,] is pronounced by some of the Arabs ثَلَاثَةَ عْشَرَ: and<br>\
[the fem.] عَشْرَةَ ↓ ثَلَاثَ, thus in the dial. of El-<br>\
Hijáz [and of most of the Arabs], is pronounced<br>\
ثَلَاثَ عَشِرَةَ in the dial. of Nejd. (S in art. عشر.)<br>\
ثُلَاثَةٌ: see ثَلَاثَةٌ.<br>\
الثَّلَاثَآءُ, also written الثَّلٰثَآءُ, (Lth, T, S, M,) or<br>\
يَوْمُ الثَّلَاثَآءِ or الثَّلٰثَآءِ, (A, Msb, K,) and ↓ الثُّلَاثَآء,<br>\
with damm, (A, K,) [meaning The third day of<br>\
the week, Tuesday,] has this form for the sake of<br>\
distinction; for properly it should be الثَّالِثُ: (S,<br>\
M:) or it has meddeh in the place of the ة in the<br>\
noun of number [ثَلَاثَةٌ] to distinguish it from the<br>\
latter: (Lth, T:) [it is without tenween in every<br>\
case; when indeterminate as well as when determinate; being fem.:] the pl. is ثَلَاثَاوَاتٌ (S, M,<br>\
Msb) and أَثَالِثُ. (Th, M.) It has no dim. (Sb,<br>\
S in art. امس.) Lh relates that Aboo-Ziyád used<br>\
to say, مَضَى الثَّلَاثَآءُ بِمَا فِيهِ [Tuesday passed with<br>\
what occurred in it]; making ثلاثاء sing. and masc.;<br>\
[but this he did because he meant thereby يَوْمُ<br>\
الثَّلَاثَآءِ; يوم being masc.:] Th is related to have<br>\
said, بِمَا فِيهَا; making it fem.: and Abu-l-Jarráh<br>\
used to say, مَضَتِ الثَّلَاثَآءُ بِمَا فِيهِنَّ, treating the<br>\
word as a numeral. (M.)<br>\
الثُّلَاثَآءُ: see الثَّلَاثَآءُ.<br>\
ثُلَاثِىٌّ a rel. n. from ثَلَاثَةٌ, anomalously formed,<br>\
(M,) [or regularly formed from ثُلَاثَةٌ,] Of, or<br>\
relating to, three things. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Three cubits<br>\
in length, or height; applied in this sense to a<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth; (T, A;) and to a<br>\
boy. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A word comprising, or composed<br>\
of, three letters [radical only, or of three radical<br>\
letters with one or more augmentative; i. e., of<br>\
three radical letters with, or without, an augment].<br>\
(T, TA.)<br>\
ثَلَاثُونَ, [also written ثَلٰثُونَ,] the noun of number, [meaning Thirty, and also thirtieth,] is not<br>\
considered as a multiple of ثَلَاثَةٌ, but as a multiple<br>\
of عَشَرَةٌ; and therefore, if you name a man ثَلَاثُونَ,<br>\
you do not make the dim. to be ثَلِيِّثُون, but [you<br>\
assimilate the noun from which it is formed to a<br>\
pl. with و and ن from عَشَرَةٌ, or to عِشْرُونَ, and<br>\
say] ↓ ثُلَيْثُونَ. (Sb, M.)<br>\
ثُلَيْثُونَ: see what immediately precedes.<br>\
ثَلَاثَاوِىٌّ: One who fasts alone on the third day<br>\
of the week. (IAar, Th, M.)<br>\
ثُلَيِّثٌ: see ثُلَاثُ.<br>\
ثَالِثٌ [Third]: fem. with ة. (T, &amp;c.) The final<br>\
ث in الثَّالِثُ is sometimes changed into ى. (M.)<br>\
You say, هُوَ ثَالِثُ ثَلَاثَةٍ [He, or it, is the third of<br>\
three]: thus you say when the two [terms] agree,<br>\
each with the other; but not ثَالِثٌ ثَلَاثَةً; ثالث<br>\
being regarded in the former case as though it<br>\
were a subst.; for you do not mean to convey by<br>\
it a verbal signification, but only mean that he, or<br>\
it, is one of the three, or a portion of the three:<br>\
(Fr, ISk, T, S:) and in like manner you say,<br>\
هِىَ ثَالِثَةُ ثَلَاثَ [She is the third of three]; but<br>\
when there is among the females a male, you say,<br>\
هِىَ ثَالِثَةُ ثَلَاثَةٍ, making the masc. to predominate<br>\
over the fem. (T.) When the two [terms] are<br>\
different, you may make the former to govern the<br>\
gen. case or to govern as a verb; saying, هُوَ رَابِعُ<br>\
ثَلَاثَةٍ or هُوَ رَابِعٌ ثَلَاثَةً, like as you say ضَارِبُ زَيْدٍ<br>\
and ضَارِبٌ زَيْدًا; and thus you also say, هٰذَا ثَالِثُ<br>\
اثْنَيْنِ and هٰذَا ثَالِثٌ اثْنَيْنِ, meaning This makes<br>\
two to be three, with himself, or itself. (ISk, T, *<br>\
S. [In most copies of the S, for ثَالِثٌ اثْنَيْنِ is<br>\
put ثَالِثَ اثْنَيْنِ; and, in the explanation of this<br>\
phrase, ثَلَّثَ اثْنَيْنِ for ثَلَثَ اثْنَيْنِ: IB has remarked that these are mistakes.]) ↓ ثِلَاث occurs in<br>\
the sense of ثَالِث in a trad. cited voce ثَانٍ in art.<br>\
ثنى. (Sh, T in art. ثنى.) ―<br>\

A projecting portion of a mountain, by which<br>\
are placed two pieces of rock, upon all which is<br>\

-b3-  [ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ and ثَالِثَةَ عَشْرَةَ, the former masc.<br>\
and the latter fem., meaning Thirteenth, are generally held to be indecl. in every case without the art.;<br>\
but with the art., most say in the nom. الثَّالِثُ عَشَرَ,<br>\
accus. الثَّالِثَ عَشَرَ, and gen. الثَّالِثِ عَشَرَ; and in<br>\
like manner in the fem. Accord. to some,] you<br>\
say, هُوَ ثَالِثُ عَشَرَ as well as هُوَ ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ [He,<br>\
or it, is a thirteenth]: he who uses the former<br>\
phrase says that he means هُوَ ثَالِثُ ثَلَاثَةَ عَشَرَ,<br>\
(T, S,) i. e. He, or it, is one of thirteen, (T,) and<br>\
that he suppresses ثلاثه, and leaves ثالث decl. as<br>\
it was; and he who uses the latter phrase says<br>\
that he likewise means this, but that, suppressing<br>\
ثلاثة, he gives its final vowel to the word ثالث,<br>\
(T, S,) to show that there is a suppression: (S:)<br>\
but IB says that the former of these two phrases<br>\
is wrong; that the Koofees allow it, but that<br>\
the Basrees disallow it, and pronounce it a mistake. (L.) [And accord. to J, one says, هٰذَا<br>\
الثَّالِثَ عَشَرَ and هٰذِهِ الثَّالِثَةَ عَشْرَةَ This is the thirteenth, or this thirteenth: for he adds,] and you<br>\
say, هذَا الحَادِى عَشَرَ and الثَّانِىَ عَشَرَ and so on<br>\
to twenty [exclusive]; all with fet-h; for the<br>\
reason which we have mentioned: and in like<br>\
manner in the fem., in which each of the two<br>\
nouns is with ة. (S.) You say also, ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ<br>\
ثَلَاثَةَ عَشَرَ [The thirteenth of thirteen]; and so<br>\
on to تَاسِعَ عَشَرَ تِسْعَةَ عَشَرَ: and in like manner in<br>\
