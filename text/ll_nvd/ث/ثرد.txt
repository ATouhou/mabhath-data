ثَرَدَ, aor.<br>\
ثَرُدَ, (M, L,) or<br>\
ثَرِدَ, (so in one place<br>\
in the TT,) inf. n. ثَرْدٌ, (T, M, Mgh, L,) He broke<br>\
a dry or hollow thing: (T, Mgh, L:) he crumbled<br>\
a thing, or broke it into small pieces, with his<br>\
fingers. (M, L.) [Hence,] ثَرَدَ خُبْزًا, (S, M, A,<br>\
Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
ثَرُدَ, (Msb,) inf. n. as above, (S,<br>\
Msb,) He crumbled bread, or broke it into small<br>\
pieces, with his fingers, (M, A, Msb, K,) then<br>\
moistened it with broth, (A, Msb,) and then piled<br>\
it up in the middle of a bowl: (A:) or he broke<br>\
bread: (S:) and in like manner ↓ اِتَّرَدَهُ, originally<br>\
اِثْتَرَدَهُ; and ↓ اِثَّرَدَهُ: (S, K:) and ثَرِيدًا ↓ اثّرد, and<br>\
↓ اتّردهُ, he made, or prepared, ثريد [i. e. bread<br>\
crumbled &amp;c. as above described]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He<br>\
rubbed and pressed a testicle with the hand, in<br>\
lieu of castrating; (K;) inf. n. as above. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  See also 2. ―<br>\
-b4-  He dipped a garment, or piece<br>\
of cloth, in dye: (K:) he dyed it with saffron<br>\
[&amp;c.]. (TA from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b5-  ثُرِدَ مِنَ المَعْرَكَةِ, (so<br>\
in a copy of the T, and in some copies of the K,<br>\
and in the CK,) or ↓ ثُرِّدَ, (so in some copies of<br>\
the K, and in the TA,) He (a man, IAar, T) was<br>\
carried away from the place of fight wounded<br>\
much but having life remaining in him. (IAar,<br>\
T, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
ثرّد, (T, M, K,) inf. n. تَثْرِيدٌ; (T, S, Mgh;)<br>\
and ↓ ثَرَدَ; (K;) [ISd says,] I think that the latter<br>\
is a dial. var. of the former; (M;) He killed an<br>\
animal that should be slaughtered without cutting<br>\
the أَوْدَاج [or external jugular veins] so as to make<br>\
the blood flow; (M, K;) i. e., (TA,) he killed it<br>\
with a blunt knife, so that he broke, [or tore, the<br>\
flesh &amp;c.,] and did not cut so as to make the blood<br>\
flow: (A, TA:) or he killed it by squeezing and<br>\
pressing the اوداج, without cutting, and making<br>\
the blood to flow: (Mgh:) or he killed it with a<br>\
thing that did not make the blood to flow freely:<br>\
or he killed it without practising the method prescribed by the law: (T:) or تثريد in slaughtering<br>\
is the breaking [the bones or joints &amp;c. of the<br>\
animal] before it is cold; and this is forbidden.<br>\
(S.) [See also مُثَرِّدٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, last sentence.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And see ثَرَدٌ, below.<br>\
4<br>\
أَثْرَدَ [It seems that Golius found أَثْرَدَ erroneously<br>\
written in a copy of the S and in a copy of the K<br>\
for اِثَّرَدَ.]<br>\
8<br>\
اِثَّرَدَ and<br>\
اِتَّرَدَ: see 1, in four places.<br>\
ثَرْدٌ Weak rain. (IAar, M, K.)<br>\
ثَرَدٌ (S, K) and ↓ تَثْرِيدٌ (A) (tropical:)  A chapping in<br>\
the lips. (S, A, K.)<br>\
ثُرْدَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
ثَرِيدٌ and ↓ مَثْرُودٌ Bread crumbled, or broken<br>\
into small pieces, with the fingers, and then moistened with broth: (Msb:) or [simply] broken bread.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, the former, (T, A,) and ↓ ثَرِيدَةٌ (T,<br>\
M, A, K) and ↓ ثُرْدَةٌ (S, M, A, Msb) and ↓ ثَرُودَةٌ<br>\
(M, K) and ↓ مَثْرُودَةٌ (K accord. to the TA) and<br>\
↓ أُثْرُدَانٌ, (Fr, M, * K,) Bread, itself, crumbled, or<br>\
broken into small pieces, with the fingers, (T, * S, *<br>\
M, A, Msb, K, *) then moistened with broth (T,<br>\
A, Msb) &amp;c., (T,) and then piled up in the middle<br>\
of a bowl; (A;) generally having some flesh-meat<br>\
with it: (L:) or ↓ ثَرِيدَةٌ signifies a mess, or<br>\
portion, of ثَرِيد [or bread crumbled or broken<br>\
&amp;c.]; (T;) [and so ↓ ثَرُودَةٌ, and ↓ مَثْرُودَةٌ:] that of<br>\
Ghassán is said by common consent to have been<br>\
prepared with marrow, and with eggs, or the<br>\
yolks of eggs; and there was no kind more delicious than these two kinds. (TA.) The pl. of<br>\
ثريدة is ثَرَائِدُ and ثُرُدٌ and ثُرْدٌ; (A, and Ham<br>\
p. 524;) the last of which is a contraction of that<br>\
next preceding it. (Ham ubi suprà.) A poet, as<br>\
cited by IAar, says,<br>\
↓ أَلَا يَا خُبْزُ يَا ابْنَةَ يَثْرُدَانٍ<br>\
أَبَى الحُلْقُومُ بَعْدَكِ لَا يَنَامُ<br>\
[Now surely, O bread, O daughter of two preparers of ثَرِيد, the throat refuses, after swallowing<br>\
thee, to rest, by reason of desire for more]: he<br>\
says that the poet calls the bread after two young<br>\
men, or slaves, who were preparing ثريد, and<br>\
gives tenween to يثردان by a poetic license,<br>\
instead of saying يَثْرُدَانِ, which, as it is [originally] a verbal phrase, he should have said by<br>\
rule: but the word, as Fr relates it, is ↓ أُثْرُدَانٍ;<br>\
and [ISd says,] I think that this is a determinate<br>\
subst., for الثَّرِيد or المَثْرُود, and therefore properly imperfectly decl., but here made perfectly<br>\
decl. by a poetic license. (M.) It is said in a<br>\
trad. that the excellence of &#39;Áïsheh above other<br>\
women is as the excellence of ثريد above other<br>\
kinds of food; but it is said that what is here<br>\
meant is food prepared with flesh-meat, together<br>\
with ثريد, because this is generally prepared with<br>\
flesh-meat, and it is said to be one of the two<br>\
things called لَحْم. (TA.)<br>\
