ثَرَىَ, inf. n. ثَرٌى, The earth,<br>\
or land, became moist and soft, after drought<br>\
and dryness: (M, K:) or became watered by<br>\

-A2-<br>\
See also the same form of the verb in the first<br>\
paragraph of art. ثرو, in six places.<br>\

ثرّى, (T, S, M, K,) inf. n. تَثْرِيَةٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
He moistened (T, S, M, K) a place, (T,) or earth,<br>\
or the ground, or dust, (M, K,) and سَوِيق [or<br>\
meal of parched barley or wheat], (S, TA,) and<br>\
any other thing: (TA:) he sprinkled a place:<br>\
(S, K:) he poured water upon, and then stirred<br>\
about, and mixed up, [the preparation of milk<br>\
termed] أَقِط, (M, K,) and سَوِيق. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  He<br>\
made his hands to cleave to the ground (T, K)<br>\
between the two prostrations in prayer, not separating them therefrom until he performed the second<br>\
prostration. (T.)<br>\

اثرى It (rain) moistened the earth. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  أَثْرَتِ الأَرْضُ The land, or earth, had much<br>\
moisture; became abundant in moisture: (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K:) or it became compact with moisture.<br>\
(AHn, M.) [See also مُثْرٍ.]<br>\
ثَرًى Moisture; humidity; (S, M, K;) of the<br>\
earth: (S, Msb:) and moist earth; (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K;) تُرَاب that is not moist is not called ثَرًى;<br>\
(Msb;) or such as, when moistened, does not<br>\
become cohesive mud or clay; (M, K;) as also<br>\
↓ ثَرْيَآءُ [an epithet used as a subst.]: (AO, T, *<br>\
K, TA: [in the CK, erroneously, ثَرَياء:]) and<br>\
the earth;; (M, K) مَا تَحْتَ الثَّرَي, in the Kur<br>\
[xx. 5], being explained as meaning what is beneath<br>\
the earth: (M:) الثَّرَى and * أَثْرَى both signify<br>\
the earth; and the latter, being thus used as a<br>\
proper name, is imperfectly decl.: (Ham p. 351:)<br>\
dual ثَرَيَانِ (S, M, K) and ثَرَوَانِ: (Lh, M, K:<br>\
[but the sing. of the latter should be written ثَرًا:])<br>\
pl. أَثْرَآْ. (M, K.) اِلْتَقَى الثَّرَيَانِ [The two moistures met, or have met,] is said when the rain has<br>\
sunk into the ground so that it has met the moisture of the earth. (S, M, K.) Accord. to IAar, it<br>\
was also said by a man, (M,) or by an Arab of the<br>\
desert, (K,) who, (M, K,) being naked, (K,) clad<br>\
himself with a fur-garment, (M, K,) without a shirt;<br>\
(M;) meaning the hair of the pubes and the soft<br>\
hair of the fur-garment. (M, K.) And the Arabs<br>\
say, شَهْرٌ ثَرَى وَشَهْرٌ تَرَى وَشَهْرٌ مَرْعَى وَشَهْرٌ اسْتَوَى,<br>\
meaning A month [of moisture] in which the rain<br>\
begins, and sinks into the ground, and moistens<br>\
and softens the earth; for شَهْرٌ ذُو ثَرًى: and a<br>\
month in which thou seest the heads of the herbage<br>\
grown forth; for شَهْرٌ تَرَى فِيهِ رُؤُوسَ النَّبَاتِ: and<br>\
a month in which the herbage is tall enough to<br>\
be pastured upon by the cattle: (As, S, * M:)<br>\
and a month in which it is full-grown and erect.<br>\
(As, M.) One says also, بَدَا ثَرَى المَآءِ مِنَ الفَرَسِ,<br>\
meaning The sweat of the horse appeared. (S, *<br>\
M.) And إِنِّى لَأَرَي ثَرَى الغَضَبِ فِى وَجْهِ فُلَانٍ,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Verily I see the effect of anger in the<br>\
face of such a one. (T.) And هُوَابْنُ ثَرَاهَا (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
is the knowing with respect to it. (T in art. بنى.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, as being likened to moist earth,] i. q.<br>\
خَيْرٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Good; anything good; &amp;c.]. (M, K. [For<br>\
خَيْر, Golius appears to have found, in a copy of<br>\
the K, حَيْز; and this, which he has rendered<br>\
“Terræ tractus,” he has given as a signification,<br>\
not of ثَرًى, but of ثَرَآءٌ, which, like ثَرًى, he also<br>\
explains as meaning “ terra. ” ]) So in the saying,<br>\
فُلَانٌ قَرِيبُ الثَّرَى [app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one<br>\
is a person from whom good is easy of attainment: or it may mean, a person from whom good<br>\
seems to be easy of attainment: in either case<br>\
likened to land of which the moist earth is near<br>\
the surface: that the phrase may have the latter<br>\
meaning appears from what here follows]. (M.)<br>\
You say, إِنَّ فُلَانًا لَقَرِيبُ الثَّرِى بَعِيدُ النَّبَطِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Verily such a one is a person who promises<br>\
but who does not fulfil. (IAar, T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence<br>\
also, (assumed tropical:)  Fresh and vigorous friendship.] You say,<br>\
لَمْ يَبْبَسِ الثَّرَى بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [The fresh and<br>\
vigorous friendship between me and him has not<br>\
withered]: whence the phrase, مَا بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَ فُلَانٍ<br>\
* مُثْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  [That friendship which is between me and<br>\
such a one is fresh and vigorous]; i. e., it has not<br>\
ceased, or become severed. (S, * M.) Jereer says,<br>\
فَلَا تُوبِسُوا بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمُ الثَّرَى<br>\
↓ فَإِنَّ الَّذَي بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكُمُ مُثْرِى<br>\
[And wither not the fresh and vigorous friendship<br>\
between me and you; for that which is between<br>\
me and you is fresh and vigorous]. (S, M.)<br>\
[<br>\
ثَرٍ, fem. ثَرِيَةٌ, Moist; humid.] You say أَرْضٌ<br>\
ثَرِيَةٌ, (M, Msb,) like عَمِيَةٌ, (Msb,) or ↓ ثَرِيَّةٌ, like<br>\
غَنِيَّةٌ, (K, [but this is anomalous, as part. n. of<br>\
ثَرِيَت,]) and ↓ ثَرْيَآءُ, (Msb, K,) Earth, or land,<br>\
that has become moist and soft, after drought<br>\
and dryness: (M, K:) or watered by rain that<br>\
has penetrated to its moistness: (Msb:) or the<br>\
last, land of just, or moderate, moisture: (AHn,<br>\
M:) or moist land; (T, S, M;) and so the first.<br>\
(M.) And ↓ مَكَانٌ ثَرْيَانُ A place of which the<br>\
earth has in it moisture. (TA.) And ↓ يَوْمٌ ثَرِىٌّ<br>\
A humid day. (TA.)<br>\
