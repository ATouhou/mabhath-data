Nov., O. S.: (see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل; and<br>\

are many obscure stars; (IAth, TA;) the number<br>\
altogether being said to be four and twenty,<br>\
agreeably with an assertion of the Prophet: some<br>\
say that it is so called because of the abundance<br>\

the dim. form, which is used in this instance to<br>\
denote magnification. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
