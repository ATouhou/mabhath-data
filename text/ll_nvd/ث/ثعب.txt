ثَعَبَهُ, (S, A, K,) aor.<br>\
ثَعَبَ, (K,) inf. n. ثَعْبٌ,<br>\
(S,) He gave vent to it; or made it to flow forth,<br>\
run, or stream; namely, water, (S, A, K,) and<br>\
blood, and the like. (K.) ثعب دَمًا, [thought by<br>\
MF to be ثَعَبَ, but I see no reason why it should<br>\
not be ثَعَبَ,] said of a wound, means It flowed,<br>\
or ran, with blood. (TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انثعب It (water) had vent; or it flowed<br>\
forth, ran, or streamed; (S, A, K;) in, or<br>\
through, a مَثْعَب: (S TA:) and in like manner,<br>\
rain: (TA:) and blood from the nose. (S, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] صَاحَ بِهِ فَانْثَعَبَ إِلَيْهِ (tropical:)  He called out<br>\
to him and he sprang up and ran to him. (A,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
ثَعْبٌ, applied to water, (K,) and to blood,<br>\
(TA,) Flowing, running, or streaming; as also<br>\
↓ ثَعَبٌ and ↓ أُثْعُوبٌ and ↓ أُثْعُبَانٌ. (K, TA.) You<br>\
say ↓ سَيْلٌ أُثْعُوبٌ [A flowing torrent]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And [hence,] ↓ شَرٌّ أُثْعُوبٌ (tropical:)  [Evil that takes its<br>\
course like a stream]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also what next<br>\
follows.<br>\
ثَعَبٌ, (so in the S, expressly said to be بِالتَّحْرِيكِ,)<br>\
or ↓ ثَعْبٌ, (so in the K,) in some copies of the<br>\
K, erroneously, مَثْعَب, (TA,) A water-course of<br>\
a valley; a channel in which water flows in a<br>\
valley: (S, K:) accord. to Lth, the rubbish and<br>\
scum that collect in the channel in which the rainwater flows; but Az disapproves of this explanation of the word, and says that it signifies, in his<br>\
opinion, the channel itself: (TA:) the pl. is<br>\
ثْعْبَانٌ. (S, K.) One says, سَالَتِ الثُّعْبَانُ كَمَا سَالَ<br>\
الثُّعْبَانُ, i. e. The torrent [or rather the torrents<br>\
ran like the serpent called ثعبان]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also ثَعْبٌ.<br>\
ثُعْبَانٌ A kind of long serpent: (S:) a great<br>\
serpent; applied to the male and the female:<br>\
(Msb:) a bulky and long serpent, (Sh, K, TA,)<br>\
that hunts the rat or mouse, to which latter animal<br>\
the name is sometimes metaphorically applied, and<br>\
that is more useful in the house than are cats:<br>\
(Sh, TA:) or particularly the male [serpent],<br>\
(Ktr, K,) that is yellow, and ruddy: (Ktr:) or<br>\
the serpent in general, (ISh, K,) male and female,<br>\
great and small: (ISh:) [also applied to an<br>\
enormous fabulous serpent; described by Kzw<br>\
and others:] pl. ثَعَابِينُ. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [رَئيِسُ<br>\
الثَّعَابِينِ The basilisk. (Golius, from a Glossary.)]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  دَمُ الثُّعْبَانِ: see دَمٌ.<br>\
فُوهُ يَجْرِى ثَعَابِيبَ, (As, S, K,) or فَمُهُ, (TA,)<br>\
and سَعَابِيبَ, (S,) His mouth runs with clear water,<br>\
having an extended [or a ropy] flow. (As, S, K.)<br>\
أُثْعُبَانٌ: see ثَعْبٌ.<br>\
أُثْعُوب: see ثَعْبٌ, in three places.<br>\
مَثْعَبٌ [The outlet, or place of outpouring, of<br>\
the water of a watering-trough &amp;c.;] the place of<br>\
passage for the water, in the side of a wateringtrough or tank: and a channel, or conduit, for<br>\
water: (KL:) pl. مَثَاعِبُ. (S, A.) You say<br>\
مَثْعَبُ الحَوةَ [The outlet for the water of the<br>\
watering-trough or tank]: (S, A:) and مَثْعَبُ السَّطْحِ<br>\
[the outlet for the water of the house-top]: (A:)<br>\
and مَثْعَبُ المَطَرِ [the outlet, or channel, for the<br>\
rain-water]: (TA:) from ثَعَبَ المَآءَ “he gave<br>\
vent to the water,” or, “made it to flow forth,”<br>\
&amp;c. (A, TA.) And مَثَاعِبُ المَدِينَةِ, meaning The<br>\
channels, or places of flowing, of the water of the<br>\
city: (K, TA:) whence it appears that MF has<br>\
erred in saying that مَثْعَبٌ signifies [only] a مِزْرَاب<br>\
[or spout for conveying away water from a housetop &amp;c.]: not a channel, or place of flowing.<br>\
(TA.) [See also صُنْبُورٌ, and لَوْلَبْ.]<br>\
