ثَبَنَ الثَّوْبَ, aor.<br>\
ثَبِنَ, inf. n. ثَبْنٌ and ثِبَانٌ,<br>\
He folded the extremity of the garment, and<br>\
sewed it; (S, K;) [he made a tuck in the garment,<br>\
to shorten it;] like خَبَنَهُ: (S:) or, (K,) i. e.<br>\
ثَبَنَ, (TA,) he put a thing into the receptacle<br>\
[thereof] and carried it before him; as also<br>\
↓ تثبّن: and in like manner, he folded and sewed<br>\
over a thing the doubled upper border of his<br>\
trousers in front: (K, * TA:) or شَيْئًا ↓ تثبّن has<br>\
this last meaning; and signifies also he put a<br>\
thing into a ثِبَان [q. v.] and carried it before<br>\
him: (S:) and ثَبَنَ فِى ثَوْبِهِ, aor. and inf. ns.<br>\
as above; (M;) and فِيهِ ↓ اثبن, (M, K, as in the<br>\
CK,) accord. to [some of] the copies of the K<br>\
اثتبن, but the former is the right reading; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ ثبّن; (M;) he put a thing into the receptacle<br>\
[thereof] and carried it before him [in his garment]: (M, K: *) [see also أَخْبَنَ:] or you say,<br>\
فِى ثَوْبِهِ ↓ ثبّنهُ he made it a ثِبَان (or thing carried<br>\
[before him]) in his garment: (T:) and ↓ تثبّن<br>\
ثِبَانًا he made a receptacle in which he [so] carried<br>\
a thing before him. (T.)<br>\

ثِبَانٌ A receptacle, such as when one folds the<br>\
skirt of his shirt and puts in it a thing and<br>\
carries it before him: (S:) or the part, of the<br>\
garment, which is the place wherein one carries,<br>\
when he wraps it around his body, or puts a<br>\
portion thereof under his right shoulder and<br>\
another portion over his left shoulder, then folds<br>\
before him a part of it, and puts a thing in it;<br>\
as also ↓ ثُبْنَةٌ: (M:) or the part, of one&#39;s garment,<br>\
which is the place wherein he carries; folding its<br>\
extremity, and sewing it, before him, and then<br>\
putting in it some dates or other things: as also<br>\
↓ ثَبِينٌ and ↓ ثُبْنَةٌ: (K:) and the extremity of<br>\
the [garment called] رِدَآء when one folds it before<br>\
him and sews it [and puts a thing in it to carry]:<br>\
(M:) or a receptacle in which one carries a thing<br>\
before him; (T:) and ↓ ثُبْنَةٌ, of which the pl.<br>\
is ثُبَانٌ, (T,) or its pl. is ثُبَنٌ, like as the pl of<br>\
خُبْنَةٌ [which has a similar meaning] is خُبَنٌ,<br>\
(Har p. 427,) the doubled upper border of the<br>\
trousers or waist-wrapper, in which one carries<br>\
[before him] fruit and other things: [see also<br>\
خُبْنَةٌ:] or, as some say, ثِبَانٌ does not signify<br>\
a receptacle, but dates that are put and carried<br>\
in a receptacle or some other thing: and sometimes what a man carries in his sleeve; and ↓ ثُبْنَةٌ<br>\
signifies only what one carries before him, that<br>\
is little in quantity: and what is great is not<br>\
called ثِبَانٌ. (T.) It is said in a trad. of &#39;Omar,<br>\
إِذَا مَرَّ أَحَدُكُمْ بِحَائِطٍ فَلْيَأْكُلْ مِنْهُ وَلَا يَتَّخِذْ ثِبَانًا<br>\
[When any one of you passes by a garden<br>\
of palm-trees, let him eat thereof, but not<br>\
take for himself, or make, a ثبان]: i. e.,<br>\
when a necessitous hungry person passes by<br>\
a man&#39;s garden of palm-trees, he may eat of<br>\
their dates what will repel his hunger. (T.<br>\
[See also another reading voce خُبْنَةٌ.]) And one<br>\
says, قَدِمَ فُلَانٌ بِثِبَانٍ فِى ثَوْبِهِ مَا أَدْرِى مَا هُوَ<br>\
[Such a one came with a ثبان in his garment: I<br>\
know not what it was]. (T.)<br>\
ثَبِينٌ: see ثِبَانٌ.<br>\
مَثْبَنَةٌ A bag in which a woman puts her mirror<br>\
and apparatus: (M, K:) of the dial. of ElYemen. (M.)<br>\

تَثْبِيَةٌ, [inf. n. of ثبّى, mentioned in the T<br>\
and K, in all its senses, in art. ثبى, and so in the<br>\
M, except in the first of the following senses,<br>\
which is there mentioned in art. ثبى and also in<br>\
art. ثبو,] The act of collecting (K, TA) in successive assemblages (↓ ثُبَةً ثُبَةً). (TA.) You say,<br>\
ثبّاهُ He collected it, namely, a thing, (M,) and<br>\
water: (M * and TA in art. ثبو:) and he added<br>\
to it, and collected it. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The collecting what is good: and also, what is bad, or evil:<br>\
thus bearing two contr. significations. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[And hence,] The praising a man in his life-time:<br>\
(AA, S, K:) or praising him time after time in<br>\
his life-time: (TA:) or praising him much; as<br>\
though relating to him collections (↓ ثُبَات) of<br>\
praise: (Z, TA;) or the mentioning of the sundry<br>\
good qualities or actions: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and<br>\
the magnifying [a person]; or honouring [him].<br>\
(T, * K.) You say, ثبّى الرَّجُلَ, (M,) or ثبّى عَلَى<br>\
الرَّجُلِ, (T,) He praised the man in his life-time:<br>\
(T, M:) because the doing so implies the collecting his good qualities or actions. (T, * M.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
[Hence also the contr. signification,] The blaming,<br>\
or censuring, much; collecting blame, or censure,<br>\
from this and that source. (TA. [The act.<br>\
part. n. is rendered in the M agreeably with this<br>\
explanation.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  The act of completing [and augmenting a thing]. (K.) You say, ثَبِّ مَعْرُوفَكَ<br>\
Complete and augment [thy beneficence, or bounty,<br>\
or favour]. (T.) And ثبّى اللّٰهُ لَكَ النِّعَمَ [May<br>\
God complete and augment to thee benefits, or<br>\
blessings: or] may God send to thee benefits, or<br>\
blessings. (TA.) [See also 1.] ―<br>\
-b6-  The putting<br>\
a thing into a good, right, or sound, state, and<br>\
augmenting it. (T, K. *) ―<br>\
-b7-  ثبّى المَالَ He kept,<br>\
preserved, guarded, or took care of, the property.<br>\
(Kr, M.)<br>\
-A2-  ثَبَّيْتُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ, (As, S,) inf. n. تَثْبِيَةٌ,<br>\
(As, T, S, M, K,) I kept constantly, or perseveringly, to the thing. (As, T, S, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The<br>\
inf. n. signifies also The keeping, (T,) or pursuing,<br>\
(K,) the way, course, mode of acting, or the like,<br>\
of one&#39;s father: (T, K:) or the doing, or acting,<br>\
like one&#39;s father. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The complaining<br>\
of one&#39;s state, or case, and of one&#39;s want; and<br>\
asking aid, or assistance, and vengeance, or avengement. (K.) [One of the meanings assigned to<br>\
the verb by Golius, as on the authority of the K,<br>\
and by Freytag after him, is “ Disposuit paravitque<br>\
se: ” app. from the former&#39;s having found الاِسْتِعْدَادُ<br>\
written in a copy of the K for الاِسْتِعْدَآءُ.]<br>\
-A3-  أَنَا<br>\
أَعْرِفُهُ تَثْبِيَةً I know him, or it, with a seeming, not<br>\
a certain, knowledge. (T, TA.)<br>\
ثُبَةٌ A company (T, S, M, K) of men; (T, M;)<br>\
as also ↓ أُثْبِيَّةٌ; (M, K; [in the CK erroneously<br>\
written اَثْبِيَة;]) and أُثْئِيَّةٌ: (TA:) a company in<br>\
a state of separation or dispersion; or a distinct<br>\
body, or company, of men: (T:) and a troop of<br>\
horsemen; such as is termed عُصْبَة: (M, K: [in<br>\
the CK, العَصَبَةُ is erroneously put for العُصْبَةُ:])<br>\
the pl. is ثُبَاتٌ and ثُبُونَ (T, S, M, K) and ثِبُونَ<br>\
(S, M) and (the pl. of أُثْبِيَّةٌ, TA) أَثَابِىُّ and أَثَابِيَةٌ,<br>\
in which last the ة is a substitute for the last ى<br>\
[of أَثَابِىُّ]: (M, TA:) or [accord. to some,] أَثَابِىُّ,<br>\
which signifies companies, has no sing.; but, as<br>\
some say, its sing. is ↓ أَثْبِيَّةٌ, of the measure أُفْعُولَةٌ,<br>\
[originally أُثْبُويَةٌ,] which means  a numerous company: (Ham p. 796:) [it is also said that] ثُبًى is<br>\
a pl. of ثُبَةٌ as meaning a company; (L in art.<br>\
ثوب, and Ham p. 271;) and hence the phrase<br>\
الثُّبَى العَالِى, for الثُّبَى العَالِيَةُ, [the high, or exalted, companies,] the former word being made<br>\
masc. because it is like زُلَمٌ [which is sing. and<br>\
masc.]; but some say that this word here means<br>\
the assemblies of the nobles: (Ham ubi suprá:)<br>\
IAar says, الثُّبَى العَالِى مِنْ مَجَالِسِ الأَشْرَافِ; but<br>\
[ISd observes,] this is extraordinary, and I have<br>\
not heard it except in the poetry of El-Find EzZimmánee. (M.) Accord. to some, it is from<br>\
ثَابَ, being originally ثُوبَةٌ; and its dim. is ثُوَيْبَةٌ:<br>\
(T:) or it is originally ثُبَىٌ: (S:) accord. to Er-Rághib, the letter elided from ثُبَةٌ as meaning “ a<br>\
company,” but not as relating to a wateringtrough or tank, is ى; and ISd holds it to be ى:<br>\
and [if so,] its dim. is ↓ ثُبَيَّةٌ: (TA:) [but ISd<br>\
adds,] IJ says that the elided letter is و, because<br>\
it is this in most cases, as in أَبٌ and أَخٌ and سَنَةٌ<br>\
and عِضَةٌ &amp;c. (M in arts. ثبو and ثبى.) [See<br>\
also art. ثوب. It seems to signify also An assemblage, or a collection, of things of any kind:] see 2,<br>\
in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The middle of a wateringtrough or tank, (T, S, M, K,) to which the water<br>\
returns [when it has been emptied], (S,) or to<br>\
which what remains of the water returns: (T:)<br>\
and the place where the water collects in a valley<br>\
or low ground: (Aboo-Kheyreh, T:) but this is<br>\
from ثَابَ; (T, S; *) the ة is a substitute for the<br>\
و, the medial radical, which is suppressed; for it<br>\
is originally ثُوَبٌ: (S:) or it is originally ثُوبَةٌ:<br>\
(T:) or it may be from ثَبَّيْتُ “ I collected: ”<br>\
but Aboo-Is-hák makes it to be from ثَابَ المَآءُ,<br>\
aor. يَثُوبُ; and this he infers to be the case from<br>\
their saying that the dim. is ثُوَيْبَةٌ. (M.) [See<br>\
also art. ثوب.]<br>\
ثَبِىٌّ One who praises men much [while they are<br>\
living: see 2]. (TA.)<br>\
ثُبَيَّةٌ: see ثُبَةٌ, of which it is said to be the dim.<br>\
أُثْبِيَّةٌ: see ثُبَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
مُثَبًّى Property collected together. (TA.)<br>\
