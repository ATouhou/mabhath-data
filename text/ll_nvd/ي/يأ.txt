يَأْيَأَهُ, inf. n. يَأْيَأَهٌ and يَأْيَآءٌ, [respecting<br>\
the form of which latter see ظَأْظَأَ,] He made a<br>\
show of kindness, benignity, or favour to him.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  إِنَّمَا هُوَ يَأْيَآءٌ [It is only making a show<br>\
of kindness, &amp;c.: or, perhaps, He is only one<br>\
who makes a show of kindness, &amp;c,]. (L.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
يَأْيَأَ بِالقَوْمِ He called the people: (K: so too in<br>\
the L, and this is the correct meaning: TA:)<br>\
or he said to the people يَأَّيَأَّ, in order that they<br>\
should assemble, or collect together. (K) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
يَأْيَأَ بِالإِبِلِ He called to the camels by the cry<br>\
أَىْ, (whence the verb is formed by transposition,<br>\
TA,) to quiet them. (K.)<br>\
يَأْيَآءٌ The cry, or crying, of the bird called<br>\
يُؤْيُؤ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [See also the verb.] ―<br>\
-b3-  See art. أَيَا.<br>\
يُؤْيُؤٌ A certain bird (S, K) of prey, (S,)<br>\
resembling the [kind of hawk called] بَاشَق: (S,<br>\
K:) it is of the birds called صُقُور, [pl. of صَقْرٌ,]<br>\
as are also the بَازِى and the شَاهِين and the زُرَّق<br>\
and the بَاشَق: (AHát in TA, in art. بشق:)<br>\
accord. to Dmr, it is a small bird, short-tailed,<br>\
the temperament of which is, in comparison with<br>\
that of the باشق, cold and moist; for it is more<br>\
patient, or enduring, and heavier in motion:<br>\
the people of Egypt and Syria, he adds, call it<br>\
جَلَمٌ, on account of the lightness and swiftness<br>\
of its wings: (TA:) pl. يَأئِىُ, and, in a verse,<br>\
يَأئِىْ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, accord. to AA, The head,<br>\
or uppermost part, of a vessel in which كُحْل<br>\
(collyrium) is kept: mentioned before as called<br>\
بُؤْبُؤٌ, which is perhaps a mistake for يؤيؤ. (TA.)<br>\
