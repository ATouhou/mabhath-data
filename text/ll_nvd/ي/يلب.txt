load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'يلبيَلَبٌ Shields, of the kind called تِرْسَةٌ, (K,)<br>\
pl. of تُرْسٌ; or of the kind called دَرَقٌ, as<br>\
is said in the R and M; which two kinds differ<br>\
in this, that the درق, like the حَجَف, are of skin,<br>\
or leather, without any wood or sinews (or<br>\
nerves), whereas ترس is a more general appellation: (TA:) or coats of defence, syn. دُرُوعٌ,<br>\
(K,) of the fabric of El-Yemen: (TA:) made<br>\
[app. whether shields or coats of defence] of<br>\
skins; (K;) i. e., of the hides of camels: (TA:)<br>\
or coats of defence (دروع) of the fabric of ElYemen, made of skins sewed together: a coll.<br>\
gen. n., of which the n. un. is يَلَبَةٌ: &#39;Amr Ibn<br>\
Kulthoom says:<br>\
عَلَيْنَا البَيْضُ وَاليَلَبُ اليَمَانِى<br>\
وَأَسْيَافٌ يَقُمْنَ وَيَنْحَنِينَا<br>\
[Upon us (were) helmets, and leathern coats of<br>\
defence of the fabric of El-Yemen, and swords<br>\
that are straight (so accord. to the above reading,<br>\
of يَقُمْنَ, which I find in an excellent copy of<br>\
the S: but some read يُقَمْنَ, which, I think,<br>\
affords not so good a sense:) and that curve]:<br>\
(S:) or helmets made of camel&#39;s hides: [see also<br>\
أَلَبٌ and أَلَبَةٌ:] or [head-coverings made of]<br>\
plaited thongs of leather (نُسُوعٌ) woven together,<br>\
which are put on the head in lieu of the helmet:<br>\
(TA:) or skins which are sewed together, and<br>\
worn on the head, specially: (K:) or skins which<br>\
are worn beneath the [kind of coat called] دِرْع,<br>\
or [beneath that of] دِيبَاج; one of which is<br>\
called يَلَبَةٌ: or skins which are worn like the<br>\
coats of defence called دروع: or skins of which<br>\
such coats are made: (TA:) or any defensive<br>\
coverings, or armour, of skins; not of iron;<br>\
and hence, shields (دَرَقٌ) [of skins] are thus<br>\
called: a poet says,<br>\
عَلَيْهِمْ كُلُّ سَابِغَةٍِ دِلَاصٍ<br>\
وَفِى أَيْدِهِمِ اليَلَبُ المُدَارُ<br>\
[Upon them (are, or were,) all (kinds of) ample<br>\
coats of mail, smooth and glistening; and in<br>\
their hands, round shields of skins]: and يَلَبٌ,<br>\
originally is a name of that skin [of which such<br>\
coverings are made]: Aboo-Dahbal El-Jumahee<br>\
says,<br>\
دِرْعِى دِلَاصٌ شَكُّهَا شَكٌّ عَجَبْ<br>\
وَجَوْبُهَا القَاتِرُ مِنْ سَيْرِ الْيَلَبْ<br>\
[My coat of mail is smooth and glistening: its<br>\
cleaving (or sticking close) is an admirable cleaving: and its shield, of good dimensions, is of<br>\
strips of skin: so accord. to explanations in the<br>\
S, in arts. شك and قتر: but I incline to think<br>\
that جوبها here is the same as جَيْبُهَا; and that<br>\
a word is understood, which makes the meaning<br>\
to be its opening at the neck and bosom, of good<br>\
dimensions, is bordered with an edge of thongs]:<br>\
(S:) or simply skin, or hide. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
defensive coverings, or armour, of pieces of felt<br>\
(لُبُود), with a stuffing of honey (عَسَل) and sand.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, Steel; (K;) pure iron: (ISh, T,<br>\
K:) n. un. يَلَبَةٌ. (TA.) Of this signification,<br>\
the following hemistich is cited as an ex.,<br>\
وَمِحْوَرٌ أَخْلَصُ مَن مَّاءِ اليَلَبَ<br>\
[And a pulley-axis clearer (in its brightness)<br>\
than the lustre of pure iron, or steel]: but ISk<br>\
says that it is by an Arab of the desert, who,<br>\
hearing the verse of &#39;Amr Ibn-Kulthoom quoted<br>\
above, erroneously supposed يلب to signify the<br>\
most excellent kind of iron; and IDrd also<br>\
asserts that the meaning assigned to it in this<br>\
hemistich is founded upon a mistake. (TA.)<br>\
See also أَلَبَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, Anything great, big, or<br>\
large in size. (K.)<br>\
