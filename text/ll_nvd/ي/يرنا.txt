يَرْنَأَ لِحْيَتَهُ (K, TA; in the CK, [erroneously,] تَرَنَّأَ;) He dyed his beard with يرنّأ.<br>\
(K.) A strange verb as to its form, (K,) which<br>\
[except in its final vowel] is that of an aorist,<br>\
though it is a preterite. (TA.) Mentioned in<br>\
the L in art. رنأ (q. v.), on the authority of IJ;<br>\
and there also by ISd; and AHei and others<br>\
assert the ى to be augmentative. [If so, the<br>\
verb is a quasi-quadriliteral-radical word.] F<br>\
follows Sgh, in mentioning it here. (TA.)<br>\
يُرَنَّأٌ (S, K) and يَرَنَّأٌ and يُرَنَّآءٌ (K) and يُرَنَّا<br>\
(without ء) and (accord. to [the Bári&#39;, as mentioned in] the TA, art. رنأ,) يَرْنَأٌ and يُرْنَأٌ and<br>\
(accord. to MF, who omits the two forms here<br>\
immediately preceding,) يَرَنَّاءٌ and يَرَنَّا, without ء,<br>\
(TA,) i. q. حِنَّاءٌ (S, K) [The plant Lawsonia<br>\
inermis]. See also art. رنأ, where the word is<br>\
written [erroneously in my opinion] يَرُنَّأٌ. Accord.<br>\
to IB (not IJ [as in the CK]), the may only<br>\
be omitted when the word is pronounced with<br>\
dammeh to the ى. (TA.)<br>\
