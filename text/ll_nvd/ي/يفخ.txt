يَفَخَهُ, (K,) aor.<br>\
يَفَخَ, because of the guttural<br>\
letter, or<br>\
يَفُخَ, accord. to the common rule observed<br>\
in the K, or<br>\
يَفِخَ, as though it were of the same<br>\
class as وَعَدَ, (TA,) [the last is probably the<br>\
most correct form, as يَأْفِخُهُ is the aor. of أَفَخَهُ,<br>\
of which يَفَخَهُ is a dial. form,] He, or it, hit<br>\
him, or hurt him, on the part of his head called<br>\
the يَافُوخ. (K.)<br>\
يَافُوخٌ [The top of the head;] the part where<br>\
the anterior and posterior bones of the head<br>\
meet: [see يَأْفُوخٌ, of which it is a dial. form:]<br>\
pl. يَوَافِيخُ. (TA.) ISd regards this form of<br>\
pl. as an indication that the ى is a radical letter,<br>\
and therefore mentions it in this art.; (TA;)<br>\
[and F says the same in art. أفخ: but see that<br>\
art.]. ―<br>\
-b2-  مَسَّ بِيَافُوخِهِ السِّمَاكَ (assumed tropical:)  [He touched<br>\
Spica Virginis, or Arcturus, with the top of his<br>\
head]. (A.) ―<br>\

a one had lordship and eminence given to him.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  صَدَعُوا يَافُوخَ اللَّيْلِ (tropical:)  i. q. أَدْلَجُوا [They<br>\
journeyed in the night; &amp;c.] (A.) [See also<br>\
art. أفخ.]<br>\
