يَسْرٌ (TA) and ↓ يَسَرٌ, (M, A, K, TA,) [each an<br>\
inf. n. (see 1) used as an epithet,] and يَاسِرٌ, (K,<br>\
TA,) Easy and gentle in tractableness, submissiveness, or manageableness; applied to a man and<br>\
to a horse: (TA:) or [simply] easy; facile;<br>\

[respecting which see also عُسْرٌ, pl. مَيَاسِيرُ]. (A.)<br>\
Hence, ↓ يَسَرَاتٌ, pl. of يَسْرَةٌ and يَسَرَةٌ, applied to<br>\
the legs of a beast, signifies Easy: (M:) or light,<br>\
or active, legs of a beast: (S, TA:) or light, or<br>\

the legs of this horse are obedient and light or<br>\

يَسْرًا She brought forth her child easily: (M, K *:)<br>\
said of a woman: (M:) or ↓ يَسَرًا. (CK.) And<br>\

straitness. (TA.) You say also, ↓ خُذْ مَيْسُورَهُ<br>\
وَدَعْ مَعْسُورَهُ [Take thou what is easy thereof, and<br>\
leave thou what is difficult]. (A.) And ↓ مَيْسُورٌ<br>\

Kur. xvii. 30; meaning, gentle; (Bd, Jel;) easy:<br>\

against the body from right to left; or] the twisting downwards, by extending the right hand towards the body [and so rolling the rope or cord<br>\

يُسْرٌ [Easiness; facility;] contr. of عُسْرٌ; (S,<br>\
M, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ يُسُرٌ; (S, Msb, TA;)<br>\
[and ↓ يُسْرَى; (see 3, where it is variously explained;)] and ↓ مَيْسُورٌ is the contr. of مَعْسُورٌ,<br>\
[and therefore signifies as above; or easy; facile;]<br>\
(S;) or this last signifies, (accord. to the lexicologists, M,) what is made easy; or facilitated;<br>\
or (accord. to Sb, M, [but see مَعَقُولٌ,]) it is an<br>\
inf. n. of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, (M, K,) [used in<br>\
the sense of يُسْرٌ as explained above,] of the same<br>\
kind as [its contr.] مَعْسُورٌ; and Abu-l-Hasan<br>\
says, that this is the truth; for it has no unaugmented verb, and inf. ns. of this measure are not<br>\
of verbs which are in use, but only of imaginary<br>\
unaugmented triliteral-radical verbs, as in the case<br>\
of مَجْلُودٌ, which is [really] from تَجَلَّدَ. (M.)<br>\
For examples of يُسْرٌ, see عُسْرٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (accord.<br>\
to the M; but in the K, or; and in both of these<br>\
lexicons the signification here following is placed<br>\
first;) and in like manner, ↓ يُسُرٌ, (K,) and ↓ يَسَارٌ,<br>\
(S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ↓ يَسَارَةٌ, (S, K,) and<br>\
↓ مَيْسَرَةٌ, and ↓ مَيْسُرَةٌ, (S, M, K,) of which last<br>\
Sb says that it is like مَسْرُبَةٌ and مَشْرُبَةٌ in not<br>\
being after the manner of the verb, [but after<br>\
that of the simple substantive,] (M,) and ↓ مَيْسِرَةٌ,<br>\
(K.) Easiness [of circumstances]; (M, K;) competence, or sufficiency; or richness, or wealth, or<br>\
opulence; (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) abundance;<br>\
(Msb;) [in these senses, also, contr. of عُسْرٌ;]<br>\
and ↓ يُسْرَى signifies [the same; or] easy things<br>\
or affairs or circumstances; contr. of عُسْرَى; as<br>\

↓ أَنْظِرْنِى حَتَّى يَسَارِ [Grant thou me a delay until<br>\
I shall be in a state of easiness of circumstances,<br>\
&amp;c.]; in which the last word is indecl., with<br>\
kesr for its termination, because it is altered from<br>\
the inf. n., which is المَيْسَرَةُ. (S.) In the Kur.<br>\
[ii. 280,] some read, ↓ فَنَظِرَةٌ إِلَى مَيْسُرِهِ [Then let<br>\
there be a postponement, or delay, until his being<br>\
in a state of easiness of circumstances]: but Akh<br>\
says, that this is not allowable; for there is no<br>\
noun of the measure مَفْعُلٌ [of this kind]: as to<br>\
مَكْرُمٌ and مَعُونٌ, [it is said that] they are pls.<br>\
[virtually though not in the language of the<br>\
grammarians] of مَكْرُمَةٌ and مَعُونَةٌ. (S.) [On<br>\

K) for the game called المَيْسِر: (K:) pl. [يَاسِرُونَ<br>\
and] أَيْسَارٌ: (M, K:) A&#39;Obeyd says, I have heard<br>\
them put يَاسِرٌ in the place of يَسَرٌ, [for the explanations of which see what follows,] and ↓ يَسَرٌ in<br>\
the place of يَاسِرٌ, (M,) or ↓ يَسَرٌ and يَاسِرٌ signify<br>\
the same: and the pl. is أَيْسَارٌ: (S, A:) يَاسِرٌ signifies [as explained above, and also] a person who<br>\
plays with gaming-arrows, (S, Msb, TA,) [at the<br>\
game called المَيْسِر,] for a slaughtered camel;<br>\
because he is one of those who occasion the<br>\
slaughter of the camel; and the pl. is [as above<br>\
and] يَاسِرُونَ: (TA:) and ↓ يَسَرٌ, i. q. ضَرِيبٌ [which<br>\
signifies the same; and the person who is entrusted,<br>\
as deputy, with the disposal of the arrows in the<br>\
game above mentioned, and who shuffles them in<br>\
the رِبَابَة:] and, [as quasi-pl. of يَاسِرٌ, like as خَدَمٌ<br>\
is of خَادِمٌ,] a party assembled together at the<br>\
game called المَيْسِر: (M, K:) pl. أَيْسَارٌ: (M:) and<br>\
↓ يَسِيرٌ and ↓ يَسُورٌ signify one who contends with<br>\
another at a game of hazard; syn. قَامِرٌ: (K:)<br>\
or ↓ يَسَرٌ and ↓ يَسُورٌ, and also يَاسِرٌ, are applied to<br>\
one who has, or to whom pertains, a gamingarrow. (IAar, TA.)<br>\

مَيْسُرٌ: see يُسْرٌ.<br>\
مَيْسِرٌ The game, or play, with unfeathered and<br>\
headless arrows; (M, K;) the game of hazard<br>\
which the Arabs play with such arrows; (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) a game of the Arabs, played [by ten men,]<br>\
with ten unfeathered and headless arrows: they<br>\
first slaughtered a camel, [bought on credit, (see<br>\
below, in this paragraph,)] and divided it into<br>\
ten portions, or, as some say, [agreeably with<br>\
what follows,] into twenty-eight: the first arrow<br>\
was called الفَذُّ, and had [one notch and] one<br>\
portion of the slaughtered camel: the second,<br>\
التَّوْءَمُ, and had [two notches and] two portions:<br>\
the third, الرَّقِيبُ, and had [three notches and]<br>\
three portions: the fourth, الحِلْسُ, and had [four<br>\
notches and] four portions: the fifth, النَّافِسُ, and<br>\
had [five notches and] five portions; or, as some<br>\
say, this was the fourth: the sixth, المُسْبِلُ, and<br>\
had [six notches and] six portions: the seventh,<br>\
المُعَلَّى, which was the highest of them, having<br>\
[seven notches and] seven portions: the eighth<br>\
and ninth and tenth were called السَّفِيحُ and المَنِيحُ<br>\
and الوَغْدُ; and these three had no portions: [the<br>\
players to whom these three fell had to pay for<br>\
the slaughtered camel: (see المُسْبِلُ:) whence it<br>\
appears, that if the camel was divided into ten<br>\
portions, (see رَيْمٌ,) the game must have continued after all these were won, until it was seen<br>\
whose were the eighth and ninth and tenth arrows; and it seems to be the general opinion that<br>\
this was the case:] the camel being slaughtered,<br>\
they collected together the ten arrows, and put<br>\
them into the رِبَابَة, a thing resembling a quiver<br>\
(كِنَانَة), and turned them round about or shuffled<br>\
them (أَجَالُوهَا): [or they employed a person, whom<br>\
they called حُرْضَة, to do this:] then they put<br>\
them into the hand of the judge (الحَكَم), who<br>\
took them forth one after another in the name of<br>\
one after another of the party; [or they commissioned the حُرْضَه to do so;] and each took of<br>\
the portions of the slaughtered camel according<br>\
to his arrow; but those to whose lots fell the<br>\
arrows without portions were obliged to pay the<br>\
price of the slaughtered camel: with the flesh of<br>\
which they afterwards fed the poor; and him<br>\
who would not engage with them in the game<br>\
they reproached, and called a بَرَم: (Sefeenet Er-Rághib, printed at Boolák; p. 637:) [see also<br>\
رَقِيبٌ, and ضَرِيبٌ, and عَشْرٌ:] or any game of<br>\
hazard; or play for stakes, or wagers: (K:) so<br>\
that even the game of children with walnuts is<br>\
included under this name by Mujáhid in his explanation of verse 216 of chap. ii. of the Kur.:<br>\
(TA:) or anything in which is risk, or hazard:<br>\
(Kull, p. 321:) or the game of tricktrack, backgammon, or tables; syn. نَرْدٌ: (Sgh, K:) and<br>\
chess was called by &#39;Alee the مَيْسِر of the Persians,<br>\
or foreigners: (TA:) or the slaughtered camel<br>\
for which they played: for when they desired to<br>\
play, they bought on credit a camel for slaughter,<br>\
and slaughtered it, and divided it into twentyeight portions, or ten portions; and when one<br>\
[of the arrows] after another came forth [from<br>\
the رِبَابَة] in the name of one man after another,<br>\
the gain of him for whom came forth those to<br>\
which belonged portions appeared, and the fine<br>\
of him for whom came forth [any of the arrows<br>\
called] the غُفْل: (K:) so called as though it<br>\
were a place of division: and so used by the<br>\
poet Lebeed, who speaks of a fat مَيْسِر. (TA.)<br>\
