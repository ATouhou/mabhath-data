يَئِسَ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) مِنَ الشَّىْءِ, (S,<br>\
A *, Msb,) aor. يَيْئَسُ and يَيْئِسُ, (S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
the latter of which is extr., (Sb, S, M, K,)<br>\
like يَحْسِبُ, aor. of حَسِبَ, and يَنْعِمُ, aor. of نَعِمَ,<br>\
(As, S, TA,) and is of the dial. of the higher<br>\
classes of Mudar, as are also the similar instances, but the former is of the dial. of the<br>\
lower classes of the Mudar; (AZ, S, Msb, TA;)<br>\
or, as Sb says, accord. to his companions, the<br>\
verb was originally of two forms, يَئِسَ, aor.<br>\
يَيْئَسُ, and يَأَسَ, aor. يَيْئِسُ, and a compound<br>\
[which is يَئِسَ having يَيْئِسُ for its aor.] was<br>\
then formed from the two; but as to وَمِقَ, aor.<br>\
يَمِقُ, and وَفِقَ, aor. يَفِقُ, and وَرِمَ. aor. يَرِمُ, and<br>\
وَلِىَ, aor. يَلِى, and وَثِقَ, aor. يَثِقُ, and وَرِثَ, aor.<br>\
يَرِثُ, in each of these only one form is allowable,<br>\
with the kesr; (S, TA;) and some change the<br>\
second ى of the aor. of يَئِسَ into ا, and say<br>\
يَايَسُ and يَآءَسُ; (Mbr, S, TA;) and I&#39;Ab reads,<br>\
in the Kur. xii. 87, يِيئَسُ, after the manner of<br>\
the dial. of those who pronounce the first letter<br>\
of the aor. with kesr excepting such as is with<br>\
ى [for its first letter], (K, TA,) which dial, is<br>\
that of Temeem and Keys and Hudheyl and<br>\
Asad; (Ks, Lh, TA;) the case of ى being<br>\
made an exception by them because kesr with<br>\
that letter is difficult of pronunciation; (Sb,<br>\
TA;) but some of the Benoo-Kelb pronounce<br>\
ى also with kesr, which is extr.; (Fr, Lb, TA:)<br>\
and this is done in the instances of يِيئَسُ and<br>\
يِيجَلُ because one ى is here strengthened by<br>\
another; (K, TA;) [I find also, in a copy of<br>\
the M, يَئِيسُ, as an extr. form of the aor. of this<br>\
verb, on the authority of Sb; but it is doubtless<br>\
a mistranscription for يِيئَسُ; and there is another<br>\
evident mistranscription in a quotation from Sb<br>\
immediately following in that copy, relating to<br>\
aors. of the form of يِيئَسُ, which has been rendered correctly above, in the present work, from the<br>\
TA;] inf. n. يَأْسٌ (S, M, A, Msb, K) and يَأَسٌ,<br>\
(TA,) or يَآسٌ, (as in a copy of the M,) and يَآسَةٌ;<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, M, K, TA [but in a MS. copy of the<br>\
K I find it written يَأَسَةٌ; and in the CK, يَأْسَة;])<br>\
and إِيَاسٌ is also used as an inf. n. of this verb,<br>\
though properly an inf. n. of 4; (Msb;) He<br>\
despaired of the thing; syn. of the inf. n.<br>\
قُنُوط, (S, A, K,) contr. of رَجَآءٌ: (M, A, K:)<br>\
or he cut off hope of the thing: (A, K: *) or<br>\
his hope of the thing became cut off: (Mgh:)<br>\
and ↓ إِسْتَيْئَسَ signifies the same, (S, A, K,)<br>\
in like manner followed by مَنْ; (S;) and so<br>\
does ↓ إِتَّأَسَ, (S, K,) [originally إِيتَأَسَ,] of the<br>\
measure إِفْتَعَلَ, but with incorporation [of the<br>\
ى into the ت]. (S.) It is allowable to transpose the letters of يَئِسَ, so as to say أَيِسَ; but<br>\
not those of the inf. n. (Msb.) There is not a<br>\
word in the Arabic language commencing with<br>\
ى followed by ء except يَئِسَ [and its derivatives]<br>\
(IKtt) [and يَأَيَأَ and its derivatives, and words<br>\
commencing with an augmentative ى followed<br>\
by a radical<br>\
يَاُ^َ]. The expression لَا يَأْسَ مِنْ طُولٍ.<br>\
occurring in a description of Mohammad, means<br>\
that his stature was such as would not make<br>\
[one] to despair of his height; for he was nearer<br>\
to tallness than he was to shortness: (K, * TA:)<br>\
يأس is here an indeterminate noun governed in<br>\
the accus. case by the negative لا: (TA:) or,<br>\
accord. to one relation, the words are, لَا يَائِسَ<br>\
مِنْ طُولٍ, [in the CK, erroneously, لا يايَسُ,]<br>\
meaning, that his height was not despaired of;<br>\
i. e., he who vied with him in tallness would not<br>\
despair of him on account of his excessive<br>\
height: (K, TA:) so that يَائِس is here in the<br>\
sense of مَيْؤُوس, like مَآءٌ دَافِقٌ in the sense of<br>\
مَدْفُوقٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] يَئِسَتْ المَرْأَهُ The<br>\
woman was, or became, barren. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
يَئِسَ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) aor. يَيْئَسُ and يَيْئِسُ,<br>\
(M,) also signifies (tropical:)  He knew; syn. عَلِمَ; (S,<br>\
M, A, Msb, K;) in the dial. of En-Nakha&#39;;<br>\
(S, Msb;) or, accord. to El-Kelbee, (M,) or<br>\
Ibn-El-Kelbee, (TA,) in the dial. of Wahbeel,<br>\
a tribe of En-Nakha&#39;; or, accord. to El-Kásim<br>\
Ibn-Maan, of the dial. of Hawázin. (M, TA.)<br>\
So in the Kur. [xiii. 30] أَفَلَمْ يَيْئَسِ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا<br>\
[Do not then those who have believed know?]:<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K:) or, accord. to some of the<br>\
lexicologists, do not then those who have believed<br>\
know with a knowledge wherewith they despair<br>\
of its being otherwise than what they know? or<br>\
the meaning is, do not then those who have<br>\
believed despair of the belief of those whom<br>\
God has described as those who will not believe?<br>\
(M, TA;) but I&#39; Ab (M, TA) and &#39;Alee and<br>\
others (TA) used to read أَفَلَمْ يَتَبَيَّنِ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا;<br>\
and I&#39;Ab said that he thought that the writer<br>\
had written يَيْئَس in a state of drowsiness. (M *,<br>\
TA.) Soheym Ibn-Wetheel El-Yarboo&#39;ee also<br>\
uses the verb in this sense, in a verse cited in<br>\
art. يسر, voce يَسَرَ, q. v. (S, M *). [Z-says,] You<br>\
say, قَدْ يَئِسْتُ أَنَّكَ رَجُلُ صِدْقٍ, meaning, (tropical:)  I have<br>\
known [that thou art a good man], because<br>\
with eager desire is restlessness, and with<br>\
the cessation thereof is quiet and tranquility;<br>\
wherefore it is said, اليَأْسُ أَحَدُ الرَّاحَتَيْنِ [Despair is one of the two states of rest.] (A,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَيْأَسَهُ, (S, M, A, Mgh, K,) inf. n. إِيَاسٌ,<br>\
(L, Mgh, Msb,) of the same measure as كِتَابٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) originally إِيْآسٌ, (L, Msb,) like إِيْعَاسٌ,<br>\
(L,) and إِيْمَانٌ, (Msb,) He made him to despair:<br>\
(S, M, A, K:) or to cut off hope: (A:) or<br>\
to cease to have hope: (Mgh:) مَنْ كَذَا of such<br>\
a thing: (S:) as also ↓ آيَسَهُ [from أَيِسَ]. (Mgh,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] أَيْأُسَهَا اللّٰهُ God made her to be,<br>\
or become, barren. (Msb.)<br>\

إِسْتَيْاَ^َ see 1.<br>\
يَأَسٌ Phthisis, or consumption; syn. سِلٌّ;<br>\
(M, K;) because he who is affected by it is<br>\
despaired of; (M;) or [because] the first who<br>\
was affected by it was اليَأَسُ, (K, TA,) or<br>\
إِلْيَاس, (TA,) the son of Mudar the son of Nizár:<br>\
(K, TA:) or, as Suh says, in the R, this<br>\
disease was called دَآءُ يَاس, or دَآءُ إِلْيَاسَ, because<br>\
الياس the son of Mudar died of it. (TA.)<br>\
يَؤُسٌ: see يَائِسٌ.<br>\
يَؤُوسٌ: see يَائِسٌ.<br>\
يَئِيسٌ: see يَائِسٌ.<br>\
يَائِسٌ (M, Mgh, Msb) and ↓ يَئِيس (M) and<br>\
↓ يَؤُوسٌ (S, M, A, K) and ↓ يَؤُسٌ (M, K) Despairing: (S, M, A, Mgh, K:) but the third has<br>\
an intensive signification, (Bd, xli. 49,) [and<br>\
so the last.]<br>\
يَائِسَةٌ, A barren woman. (Msb.)<br>\
مَيْؤُوسٌ مِنْهُ Despaired of. (M, Mgh, Msb. *)<br>\
