Msb, * TA) and يَبْسٌ (M) and يُبُوسَةٌ, (K [but<br>\

former] يَتَّبِسُ and [of the latter] يَاتَبِسُ, (M,)<br>\
signifies the same as يَبِسَ: (M, K:) or is quasipass. of ↓ يَبَّسَهُ [and therefore signifies it became<br>\

يَابِسٌ Dry, or dried up, after having been<br>\

and also, [but perhaps tropically,] stiff, rigid,<br>\

(M:) pl. يُبَّسٌ (M) and ↓ يَبْسٌ, which latter is<br>\
like رَكْبٌ as pl. of راكِبٌ: (ISk, S, Msb:)<br>\
and ↓ يُبْسٌ is a dial. form. of يَبْسٌ: (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
S:) or يَبْسٌ is [rather] a quasi-pl. of يَابِسٌ, as is<br>\

↓ يَبِيسٌ, (K,) and ↓ يَبْوسٌ, (M,) and ↓ يَبَاسٌ,<br>\
(TA,) and ↓ أَيْبَسُ: (K:) or ↓ يَبَسٌ signifies dry<br>\
from its origin, not having been known moist:<br>\
(K:) but ↓ يَبْسٌ is applied to a thing dry after<br>\
having been known to be moist: (TA:) and as<br>\
to the path of Moses, [to which the former of<br>\
the last two epithets is applied in the Kur.<br>\
xx. 79,] it had never been known as a path<br>\
either moist or dry, for God only showed it to<br>\
them created such; but the epithet is also read<br>\
with sukoon to the ب, because, though it had<br>\
not been a path, it was a place wherein had been<br>\
water and which had dried up: (K, TA:) the<br>\
latter reading is that of El-Hasan El-Basree:<br>\
and El-Aamash read the word with kesr to<br>\
the ب: (TA:) Th [however] says, (S,) you<br>\
say ↓ حَطَبٌ يَبْسٌ, dry fire-wood, as though it<br>\
were so naturally: (S, Msb:) [and J says,]<br>\
↓ يَبَسٌ signifies a place dry after having been<br>\
moist; and so in the instance in the Kur. mentioned above: (S:) [and Fei says,] it signifies<br>\
a place that has had in it water which has gone<br>\
away; or, as Az says, a path in which is no<br>\
moisture: (Msb:) [and ISd says,] ↓ يَبْسٌ and<br>\
↓ يَبَس signify a place that is dry: and in like<br>\
manner, applied to land (أَرْض), of which the<br>\
water and pasturage have dried up: and the<br>\
latter, so applied, (assumed tropical:)  hard; (M;) as also يَابِسٌ<br>\
(tropical:)  applied to a stone: (A:) ↓ يَبيسٌ is [generally]<br>\
applied to a plant, or herbage, as signifying<br>\
dry, or dried up; (S, M, A, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
[sometimes] يَابِسٌ; (M, K;) the former being<br>\
of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure<br>\
فَاعِلٌ: (Msb:) or it is so applied to herbs, or<br>\
leguminous plants, of the sort termed أَحْرَار [that<br>\
are eaten without being cooked, or that are<br>\
slender and succulent, &amp;c.], (As, K,) and of the<br>\
sort termed ذُكُور [that are hard and thick, or<br>\
thick and rough, &amp;c.]; (As, TA;) and [so As,<br>\
in the TA; and so in some copies of the K;<br>\
but in the CK, or] those herbs and leguminous<br>\
plants that become scattered when they dry up;<br>\
