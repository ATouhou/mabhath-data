ياقوتٌ أَزْرَقُ: and the topaz, oriental topaz, or<br>\
yellow sapphire, also called ياقوتٌ أَصْفَرُ: the<br>\
jacinth, or hyacinth, accord. to Golius, who<br>\
observes, as on the authority of the Teyfáshee,<br>\
that by this name are called various gems of<br>\
the East; four species thereof being enumerated;<br>\
the red, the yellow, or gold-coloured, the blue,<br>\
or azure, and the white: that the sapphire and<br>\
the chrysolite are also thus called: but that,<br>\
by the word used absolutely, the red jacinth,<br>\
or hyacinth, commonly called the ruby, is meant:<br>\
which last remark is agreeable with modern<br>\
usage:] a well known gem; (K;) of which<br>\
there are many varieties, (TA,) the most excellent<br>\
whereof is that called الياقوتُ الأَحْمَرُ الرُّمَّانِىُّ,<br>\
(K,) also called البَهْرَمَانِىُّ; [the finest kind of<br>\
ruby or carbuncle;] said to be brought from<br>\
Sarandeeb [or Ceylon]: it has the property<br>\
of exhilarating, and of conjoining [separated<br>\
friends]; (TA;) and is profitable for disturbance<br>\
of the mind (occasioned by the black bile, TA)<br>\
and palpitation, and weakness of the heart and<br>\
stomach, if drunk; [being app. reduced to<br>\
powder for that purpose, as is done with some<br>\
other gems in the East;] and for congealment<br>\
of the blood, if hung [upon the person]: (K:)<br>\
it is a Persian word, (S,) arabicized: (S, K:)<br>\
of the measure فَاعُولٌ: n. un. with ة; and pl.<br>\
