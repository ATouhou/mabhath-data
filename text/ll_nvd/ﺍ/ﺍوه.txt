(K;) He said آهِ or أَوْهِ &amp;c. [i. e. Ah! or alas!];<br>\
(S, Mgh, K;) he moaned; or uttered a moan, or<br>\
moaning, or prolonged voice of complaint; (S,<br>\
TA;) i. q. تَوَجَّعَ. (Msb.)<br>\
آهِ, (Az, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) as also آهٍ, (IAmb, K,)<br>\
and آهًا, and ↓ آهَةً, (TA,) and ↓ أَوْهِ, (S, Msb, K,) and<br>\
↓ أَوْهَ, (ISd, K,) and ↓ أَوْهُ, (K,) and ↓ أَوِّهْ, (S,) or<br>\
↓ أَوِّهِ, (K,) and ↓ أَوَّهْ, (Hr, Mgh, Msb, K,) so in<br>\
some copies of the S, but in a copy in the author&#39;s<br>\
handwriting ↓ آوَّهْ, there said to be with medd,<br>\
and with teshdeed and fet-h to the و, and with<br>\
the ه quiescent, (TA,) [or,] accord. to Aboo-<br>\
Tálib, آوَّهْ, with medd, thus pronounced by the<br>\
vulgar, is wrong, (T in art. او,) and ↓ أَوَّاه, and<br>\
↓ أَوُّوه, [in both of which, and in some other forms<br>\
which follow, it is doubtful whether the ه be<br>\
quiescent or movent, and if movent, with what<br>\
vowel,] (TA,) and ↓ آوُوهُ, (K, TA,) or ↓ أَوُوهُ, but<br>\
said by ISd to be with medd, and mentioned by<br>\
AHát as heard from the Arabs, (TA,) and ↓ أَوَتَاه,<br>\
(K, TA,) or ↓ أَوَتَاهُ, (CK,) or ↓ أَوَّتَاه, and ↓ آوَّتَاه,<br>\
(S, [in one copy of which the ه is marked as<br>\
quiescent,]) and ↓ آوَيَّاه, (K, TA,) with medd,<br>\
(TA,) or ↓ أَوِيَّاهُ, (CK,) and أَوِّ (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
and آوِ, and آوٍ, (K, TA,) and وَاهًا, and هَاهٌ or هَاهُ,<br>\
(TA,) [Ah! or alas!] a word imitative of the<br>\
voice, cry, or exclamation, of the مُتَأَهِّه; (Az and<br>\
TA in explanation of آهِ;) [i. e.] a word expressive<br>\
of pain, grief, sorrow, lamentation, complaint, or<br>\
moaning; (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) denoting the<br>\
prolongation of the voice with complaint: (S,<br>\
TA, after أَوَّهْ or آوَّهْ:) sometimes, also, a man<br>\
says آهِ from a motive of affection, or pity, or<br>\
compassion, and of impatience: (Az, TA:) [and<br>\
it is also said that] آهًا is a word expressive of<br>\
grief or lamentation, or of most intense grief<br>\
or lamentation or regret; [that] it is put in<br>\
the accus. case as being used in the manner<br>\
of inf. ns.; and [that] the hemzeh is originally<br>\
و: but IAth says, آهًا is a word expressive of<br>\
pain, grief, sorrow, lamentation, complaint, or<br>\
moaning, used in relation to evil, like as وَاهًا<br>\
is used in relation to good: (TA in art. اه:)<br>\
and آوَّهْ and آوِ and آوٍ are cries uttered to horses,<br>\
to make them return. (ISh and TA in art. اوى.<br>\
See 2 in that art. in the present work.) You say,<br>\
آهِ مِنْ كَذَا [Ah, or alas, on account of, or for,<br>\
such a thing!]; (S, Msb;) and in like manner,<br>\
أَوْهِ [&amp;c.], followed by مِنْ, and by لِ, (S, TA,)<br>\
and by عَلَى. (TA.) [See also أَوِّ in art. او.]<br>\
آهَةٌ a subst. from تَأَوَّهَ; occurring in the saying<br>\
of El-Muthakkib El-&#39;Abdee,<br>\
إِذَا مَاقُمْتُ أَرْحَلُهَا بِلَيْلٍ<br>\
تَأَوَّهُ آهَةَ الرَّجُلِ الحَزِينِ<br>\
[When I arise to saddle her, by night, she moans<br>\
with the moaning of the sorrowful man]: (S,<br>\
ISd:) ISd says that, in his opinion, the subst. is<br>\
here put in the place of the inf. n., i. e. تَأَوُّه: (TA:)<br>\
but some recite the verse differently, saying, أَهَّةَ,<br>\
from أَهَّ meaning تَوَجَّعَ: (S:) and some say,<br>\
تَهَوَّهُ هَاهَةَ. (TA.) And hence the saying, in imprecating evil on a man, آهَةً لَكَ [May God cause<br>\
moaning to thee!], and أَوَّةً لَكَ, with the ه suppressed, and with teshdeed to the و. (S.) [See<br>\
also أَوَّةٌ in art. او.] And see آهِ above.<br>\
-A2-  [Also]<br>\
Measles: thus in the phrase, used in imprecating<br>\
evil on a man, آهَةً وَمَاهَةً [May God cause] measles<br>\
and small-pox [to befall thee]! (K, * TA,) mentioned by Lh on the authority of Aboo-Khálid.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
أَوْهِ and ٰأَوْهَ and أَوْهُ and أَوِّه &amp;c.: see آهِ.<br>\
أَوَّاهٌ A man often saying Ah! or alas! or often<br>\
moaning: (Mgh:) or one who says Ah! or alas!<br>\
from a motive of affection, or pity, or compassion,<br>\
and fear: or mourning, or sorrowing, much, or<br>\
often: (TA:) or compassionate; tender-hearted:<br>\
or often praying, or frequent in prayer: (K, *<br>\
TA:) or one who celebrates the praises of God,<br>\
or praises Him greatly, or glorifies Him: or who<br>\
praises much, or often: or who abases himself, or<br>\
addresses himself with earnest supplication, [to<br>\
God], confident of his prayer&#39;s being answered:<br>\
(TA:) or one having certain knowledge (K, TA)<br>\
of his prayer&#39;s being answered: (TA:) or inviting<br>\
much, or often, to what is good: (TA:) or skilled<br>\
in the law: or a believer; so in the Abyssinian<br>\
language: (K:) occurring in the Kur [ix. 115<br>\
and xi. 77]. (TA.)<br>\
