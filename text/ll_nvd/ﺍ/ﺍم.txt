اَمُ3َ, (T, M, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. أَمٌّ, (T, S, M, Msb,) He tended, repaired,<br>\
betook himself, or directed his course, to, or towards, him, or it; aimed at, sought, endeavoured<br>\
after, pursued, or endeavoured to reach or attain<br>\
or obtain, him, or it; intended it, or purposed it;<br>\
syn. قَصَدَهُ, (Lth, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) and<br>\
تَوَخَّاهُ, (T,) and تَعَمَّدَهُ, (Mgh,) and تَوَجَّهَ إِلَيْهِ;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ أَمَّمَهُ, and ↓ تأمّمهُ, (T, S, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) and ↓ ائتمّهُ, (M, K,) and ↓ يَمَّمّهُ,<br>\
(T, M, K,) and ↓ تَيَمَّمَهُ; (T, M, Mgh, K;) the<br>\
last two being formed by substitution [of ى for أ].<br>\
(M.) Hence, يَااَللّٰهُ أُمَّنَا بِخَيْرٍ [O God, bring us<br>\
good]. (JK in art. اله, and Bd in iii. 25.) And<br>\
لَأَمَّ مَا هُوَ, occurring in a trad., meaning He has<br>\
indeed betaken himself to, or pursued, the right<br>\
way: or it is used in a pass. sense, as meaning<br>\
he is in the way which ought to be pursued. (TA.)<br>\
And رَسُولَ اللّٰهِ ↓ انْطَلَقْتُ أَتَأَمَّمُ, in another trad.,<br>\
I went away, betaking myself to the Apostle of<br>\
God. (TA.) Hence, also, الصَّعِيدَ لِلصَّلَاهِ ↓ تَيَمَّمَ<br>\
[He betook himself to dust, or pure dust, to wipe<br>\
his face and his hands and arms therewith, for<br>\
prayer]: (T, * M, * Mgh, TA:) as in the Kur<br>\
iv. 46 and v. 9: (ISk, M, TA:) whence الَّتَّيَمُّمُ<br>\
as meaning the wiping the face and the hands and<br>\
arms with dust; (ISk, T, * M, * Mgh, TA;) i. e.<br>\
the performing the act termed تَوَضُّؤٌ with dust:<br>\
formed by substitution [of ى for آ]: (M, K:)<br>\
originally التَّأَمُّمُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 8.<br>\
-A2-  أَمَّهُ, (S,<br>\
M, Mgh, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
اَمُ3َ, (M, Mgh,) inf. n. أَمٌّ, (M,<br>\
Mgh, K,) He broke his head, so as to cleave the<br>\
skin, (S, Msb,) inflicting a wound such as is<br>\
termed آمَّة [q. v.]; (S;) [i. e.] he struck, (M,<br>\
Mgh, K,) or wounded, (M, K,) the أُمّ [q. v.] of<br>\
his head, (M, Mgh, K,) with a staff, or stick.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
-A3-  أَمَّهُمْ (S, M, K) and أَمَّ بِهِمْ, (M, K,)<br>\
[aor.<br>\
اَمُ3َ,] inf. n. إِمَامَةٌ, (S, [but in the M and K<br>\
it seems to be indicated that this is a simple<br>\
subst.,]) He preceded them; went before them;<br>\
took precedence of them; or led them, so as to<br>\
serve as an example, or object of imitation; syn.<br>\
تَقَدَّمَهُمْ; (M, K;) [and particularly] فِى الصَّلَاةِ<br>\
[in prayer]. (S.) And أَمَّهُ and بِهِ أَمَّ He prayed<br>\
as إِمَام [q. v.] with him. (Msb.) And أَمَّ الصُّفُوفَ<br>\
He became [or acted as] إِمَام to the people composing the ranks [in a mosque &amp;c.]. (Har p. 680.)<br>\
You say also, لَا يَؤُمُّ الرَّجُلُ الرَّجُلَ فِى سُلْطَانِهِ [A<br>\
man shall not take precedence of a man in his<br>\
authority]; meaning, in his house, and where he<br>\
has predominance, or superior power, or authority;<br>\
nor shall he sit upon his cushion; for in doing so<br>\
he would show him contempt. (Mgh in art. سلط.)<br>\
-A2-  أَمَّتٌ, (S, M, K,) [first pers. أَمُمْتُ,] aor.<br>\
اَمُ3َ,<br>\
(M,) inf. n. أُمُومَةٌ, (M, K,) She (a woman, S)<br>\
became a mother; (S, M, K;) [as also أَمَّتٌ<br>\
having for its first pers. أَمِمْتُ, aor.<br>\
اَمَ3َ; for] you<br>\
say, مَا كُنْتِ أُمَّا وَلَقَدْ أَمِمْتِ [Thou wast not a<br>\
mother, and thou hast become a mother], (S, M,<br>\
K, [in the last فَأَمِمْتِ,]) with kesr, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
أُمُومَةٌ. (S, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَمَمْتُهُ I was to him a mother. (A in art. ربض.) IAar, speaking of a<br>\
woman, said, كَانَتْ لَهَا عَمَّةٌ تَؤُمُّهَا, meaning [She<br>\
had, lit. there was to her, a paternal aunt] who<br>\
was to her like the mother. (M.)<br>\
2<br>\
أَمَّمَهُ and<br>\
يَمَّمَهُ: see 1, first sentence, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
3<br>\
آمّهُ It agreed with it, neither exceeding nor<br>\
falling short. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [See also the part. n.<br>\
مُؤَامٌّ, voce أَمَمٌ; whence it seems that there are<br>\
other senses in which آمَّ may be used, intransitively.]<br>\
5<br>\
تَأَمَّمَ and<br>\
تَيَمَّمَ: see 1, former part, in four<br>\
places.<br>\
-A2-  تأمّم بِهِ: see 8.<br>\
-A3-  تَمَّمْتُ I took for<br>\
myself, or adopted, a mother. (S.) And تَأَمَّمَهَا<br>\
He took her for himself, or adopted her, as a<br>\
mother; (S, * M, K;) as also ↓ استآمّها, (M, K,)<br>\
and تَأَمَّهَهَا. (M.)<br>\
8<br>\
ائتمّهُ [written with the disjunctive alif<br>\
اِيتَمَّهُ]: see 1, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-  ائتمّ بِهِ He followed his example; he imitated him; he did as<br>\
he did, following his example; or taking him as<br>\
an example, an exemplar, a pattern, or an object<br>\
of imitation; (S, Mgh, Msb;) as also ↓ أَمَّهُ: (Bd<br>\
in xvi. 121:) the object of the verb is termed<br>\
إِمَامٌ; (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) applied to a learned<br>\
man, (Msb,) or a head, chief, or leader, or some<br>\
other person. (M, K.) He made it an أُمَّة or إِمَّة<br>\
[i. e. a way, course, or rule, of life or conduct;<br>\
as explained immediately before in the work<br>\
whence this is taken]; as also به ↓ تأمّم. (M.)<br>\
You say, ائتمّ بِالشَّيْءِ and ائْتَمَى به, by substitution [of ى for م], (M, K,) disapproving of the<br>\
doubling [of the م]. (M.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَاْمَ3َ see 5.<br>\
أَمْ is a conjunction, (S, M, K,) connected with<br>\
what precedes it (Msb, Mughnee) so that neither<br>\
what precedes it nor what follows it is independent, the one of the other. (Mughnee.) It<br>\
denotes interrogation; (M, K;) or is used in a<br>\
case of interrogation, (S, Msb,) corresponding to<br>\
the interrogative أَ, and meaning أَىّ, (S,) or, as<br>\
Z says, أَىُّ الأَمْرَيْنِ كَائِنٌ; [for an explanation of<br>\
which, see what follows;] (Mughnee;) or, [in<br>\
other words,] corresponding to the interrogative أَ,<br>\
whereby, and by أَمْ, one seeks, or desires, particularization: (Mughnee:) it is as though it were<br>\
an interrogative after an interrogative. (Lth, T.)<br>\
Thus you say, أَزَيُدٌ فِى الدَّارِ أَمْ عَمْرٌو [Is Zeyd in<br>\
the house, or &#39;Amr?]; (S, Mughnee;) i. e. which<br>\
of them two (أَيُّهُمَا) is in the house? (S;) therefore what follows ام and what precedes it compose<br>\
one sentence; and it is not used in commanding<br>\
nor in forbidding; and what follows it must correspond to what precedes it in the quality of noun<br>\
and of verb; so that you say, أَزَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ أَمع قَاعِدٌ<br>\
[Is Zeyd standing, or sitting?] and أَقَامَ زَيْدٌ أَمْ<br>\
قَعَدَ [Did Zeyd stand, or sit?]. (Msb.) It is not<br>\
to be coupled with أَ after it: you may not say,<br>\
أَعِنْدَكَ زَيْدٌ أَمْ أَعِنْدَكَ عَمْرٌو. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  As connected<br>\
in like manner with what goes before, it is preceded by أَ denoting equality [by occurring after<br>\
سَوَآءٌ &amp;c.], and corresponds thereto, as in [the Kur<br>\
lxiii. 6,] سَوَآءُ عَلَيْهِمْ أَسْتَغْفَرْتَ لَهُمٌ لَمٌ تَسْتَغُفِرْ لَهُمٌ<br>\
[It will be equal to them whether thou beg forgiveness for them or do not beg forgiveness for them].<br>\
(Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is also unconnected with what<br>\
precedes it, (S, Msb, Mughnee,) implying always<br>\
digression, (Mughnee,) preceded by an enunciative, or an interrogative, (S, Msb, Mughnee,)<br>\
other than أَ, (Mughnee,) or by أَ not meant<br>\
[really] as an interrogative but to denote disapproval, (Mughnee,) and signifies بَلْ, (Lth, Zj,<br>\
T, S, M, Mughnee, K,) or بَلْ and أَ together,<br>\
(Msb,) and this is its meaning always accord.<br>\
to all the Basrees, but the Koofees deny this.<br>\
(Mughnee.) Thus, using it after an enunciative,<br>\
you say, إِنَّهَا لَإِبِلٌ أَمْ شَآءٌ [Verily they are camels:<br>\
nay, or nay but, they are sheep, or goats: or nay,<br>\
are they sheep, or goats?]: (S Msb, Mughnee:)<br>\
this being said when one looks at a bodily form,<br>\
and imagines it to be a number of camels, and<br>\
says what first occurs to him; then the opinion<br>\
that it is a number of sheep or goats suggests<br>\
itself to him, and he turns from the first idea, and<br>\
says, أَمْ شَآءٌ, meaning بَلْ, because it is a digression<br>\
from what precedes it; though what follows بل<br>\
is [properly] a thing known certainly, and what<br>\
follows ام is opined. (S, TA.) And using it after<br>\
an interrogative in this case, you say, هَلْ زيْدٌ<br>\
مُنْطَلِقٌ أَمْ عَمْرٌو [Is Zeyd going away? Nay<br>\
rather, or, or rather, is &#39;Amr?]: you digress from<br>\
the question respecting Zeyd&#39;s going away, and<br>\
make the question to relate to &#39;Amr; so that ام<br>\
implies indecisive opinion, and interrogation, and<br>\
digression. (S.) And thus using it, you say, هَلْ زَيْدٌ<br>\
قَامَ أَمْ عَمْرٌو [Did Zeyd stand? Nay rather, or<br>\
or rather, did &#39;Amr?]. (Msb.) And an ex. of<br>\
the same is the saying [in the Kur xiii. 17],<br>\
هَلْ يَسْتَوِى الْأَعْمَى وَالْبَصِيرُ أَمْ هَلْ تَسْتَوِى الظُّلُمَاتُ<br>\
وَالنُّورُ [Are the blind and the seeing equal? Or<br>\
rather are darkness and light equal?]. (Mughnee.)<br>\
And an ex. of it preceded by أَ used to denote<br>\
disapproval is the saying [in the Kur vii. 194],<br>\
أَلَهُمْ أَرْجُلٌ يَمْشُونَ بِهَا أَمْ لَهُمْ أَيْدٍ يَبْطِشُونَ بِهَا [Have<br>\
they feet, to walk therewith? Or have they hands<br>\
to assault therewith?]: for أَ is here equivalent to<br>\
a negation. (Mughnee.) [It has been shown<br>\
above that] أَمْ is sometimes introduced immediately before هَلْ: (S, K:) but IB says that this<br>\
is when هل occurs in a phrase next before it; [as<br>\
in the ex. from the Kur xiii. 17, cited above;]<br>\
and in this case, the interrogative meaning of ام<br>\
is annulled; it being introduced only to denote a<br>\
digression. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It is also used as a simple<br>\
interrogative; accord. to the assertion of AO; in<br>\
the sense of هَلْ; (Mughnee;) or in the sense of<br>\
the interrogative أَ; (Lth, T, K) as in the saying,<br>\
أَمْ عِنْدَكَ غَدَآءِ حَاضِرٌ, meaning Hast thou a morning-meal ready? a good form of speech used by<br>\
the Arabs; (Lth, T;) and allowable when preceded by another phrase. (T.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And sometimes<br>\
it is redundant; (AZ, T, S, Mughnee, K) in the<br>\
dial. of the people of El-Yemen; (T;) as in the<br>\
saying,<br>\
يَا دَهْنَ أَمْ مَا كَانَ مَشْيِى رقَصَا<br>\
بَلْ قَدْ تَكُونُ مِشْيَتِى تَوَقُّصَا<br>\
(T, S, * [in the latter, يا هِنْدُ, and only the former<br>\
hemistich is given,]) meaning O Dahnà, (the<br>\
curtailed form دَهْنَ being used for دَهْنَآء,) my<br>\
walking was not, as now in my age, [a feeble<br>\
movement like] dancing: but in my youth, my<br>\
manner of walking used to be a bounding: (T:)<br>\
this is accord. to the opinion of AZ: but accord.<br>\
to another opinion, ام is here [virtually] conjoined<br>\
with a preceding clause which is suppressed; as<br>\
though the speaker had said, يَا دَهْنَ أَكَانَ مَشْيِى<br>\
رَقَصَّا أَمْ مَا كَانَ كَذلِكَ. (A &#39;Hát, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  It is<br>\
also used (T, Mughnee) in the dial. of the people<br>\
of El-Yemen, (T,) or of Teiyi and Himyer,<br>\
(Mughnee,) in the sense of ال, (T,) to render a<br>\
noun determinate. (Mughnee.) So in the trad.,<br>\
لَيْسَ مِنَ امْبِرّ امْصِيامُ فِى امْسَفَرِ, (T, Mughnee,)<br>\
i. e. الَيْسَ مِنَ البِرِّ الصِّيَامُ فِى السَّفَرِ [Fasting in<br>\
journeying is not an act of obedience to God].<br>\
(T, and M in art. بر.) So too in the trad., اَلْآنَ<br>\
طَابَ امْضَرْبُ Now fighting has become lawful;<br>\
as related accord. to the dial. of Himyer, for<br>\
الضَّرْبُ. (TA in art. طيب.) It has been said that<br>\
this form ام is only used in those cases in which<br>\
the ل of the article does not become incorporated<br>\
into the first letter of the noun to which it is prefixed; as in the phrase, خُذِ الرُّمْحَ وَارْكَبِ امْفَرَسَ<br>\
[Take thou the spear, and mount the mare, or<br>\
horse], related as heard in El-Yemen; but this<br>\
usage may be peculiar to some of the people of<br>\
that country; not common to all of them; as<br>\
appears from what we have cited above. (Mughnee.)<br>\
-A3-  أَمَ for أَمَا, before an oath: see art. اما.<br>\
-A4-  And أَمَ اللّٰهِ and أَمُ اللّٰهِ &amp;c.: see أَيْمُنُ اللّٰهِ, in<br>\
art. يمن.<br>\
أُمٌّ A mother (T, S, M, Msb, K, &amp;c.) [of a<br>\
human being and] of any animal; (IAar, T;)<br>\
as also ↓إِمٌّ, (Sb, M, Msb, K) and ↓إُمَّةٌ, (T,<br>\
M, Msb, K,) and ↓أُمَّهَةٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) which<br>\
last is the original form (S, Msb) accord. to<br>\
some, (Msb,) or the ه in this is augmentative (M,<br>\
Msb) accord. to others: (Msb:) the pl. is أُمَّهَاتٌ<br>\
(Lth, T, S, M, Msb, K) and أُمَّاتٌ; (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K;) or the former is applied to human beings,<br>\
and the latter to beasts; (T, S;) or the former to<br>\
rational beings, and the latter to irrational; (M,<br>\
K;) or the former is much applied to human<br>\
beings, and the latter to others, for the sake<br>\
of distinction; (Msb;) but the reverse is sometimes the case: (IB:) IDrst and others hold<br>\
the latter to be of weak authority: (TA:) the<br>\
dim. of أُمٌّ is ↓ أُمَيْمَةٌ (T, S, K) accord. to some<br>\
of the Arabs; but correctly, [accord. to those<br>\
who hold the original form of أُمٌّ to be أُمَّهَةٌ,]<br>\
it is ↓ أُمَيْمِهَةٌ. (Lth, T, TA. [In a copy of the<br>\
T, I find this latter form of the dim. written<br>\
اميهة.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  أُمَّ لَكَ denotes dispraise; (S;) being<br>\
used by the Arabs as meaning Thou hast no<br>\
free, or ingenuous, mother; because the sons<br>\
of female slaves are objects of dispraise with the<br>\
Arabs; and is only said in anger and reviling:<br>\
(A Heyth, T:) or, as some say, it means thou<br>\
art one who has been picked up as a foundling,<br>\
having no Known mother: (TA:) [or] it is also<br>\
sometimes used in praise; (A &#39;Obeyd, T, S, K;)<br>\
and is used as an imprecation without the desire<br>\
of its being fulfilled upon the person addressed,<br>\
being said in vehemence of love; [lit. meaning<br>\
mayest thou have no mother!], like ثَكِلَتْكَ أُمُّكَ,<br>\
and لَا أَبَا لَكَ, [and قَاتَلَكَ اللّٰهُ,] &amp;c. (Har p. 165.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Some elide the ا of أُمّ; as in the saying of<br>\
&#39;Adee Ibn—Zeyd.<br>\
أَيُّهَا العَائِبُ عِنْدِمَّ زَيْدٍ<br>\
[O thou who art blaming in my presence the<br>\
mother of Zeyd]; meaning, عِنْدِى أُمَّ زَيْدٍ; the<br>\
ى of عندى being also elided on account of the<br>\
occurrence of two quiescent letters [after the<br>\
elision of the ا of أُمّ]: (Lth, T, S:) and as in<br>\
the phrase وَيْلُمِّهِ, (S,) which means وَيْلٌ لِأُمِّهِ.<br>\
(S, and K in art. ويل, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b4-  هُمَا أُمَّاكّ means<br>\
They two are thy two parents: or thy mother<br>\
and thy maternal aunt. (K.) [But] فَدَّاهُ بِأُمَّيْهِ<br>\
is said to mean [He expressed a wish that he<br>\
(another) might be ransomed with] his mother<br>\
and his grandmother. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  One says also,<br>\
لَا تَفْعَلِى ↓ يَا أُمَّتِ [O my mother, do not thou<br>\
such a thing], and [in like manner] يَا أَبَتِ افْعَلْ;<br>\
making the sign of the fem. gender a substitute<br>\
for the [pronominal] affix ى; and in a case<br>\
of pause, you say يَا أُمَّهْ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And one says,<br>\
مَا أُمِّى وَأُمُّهُ, and مَا شَكْلِى وَشَكْلُهُ, meaning [What<br>\
relationship have I to him, or it? or what concern<br>\
have I with him, or it? or] what is my case<br>\
and [what is] his or its, case? because of his,<br>\
or its, remoteness from me: whence, (T,)<br>\
وَمَا أُمِّى وَأُمُّ الوَحْشِ لَمَّا<br>\
تَفَرَّعَ فِى مَفَارِقِىَ الْمَشِيبُ<br>\
[And what concern have I with the wild animals<br>\
when hoariness hath spread in the places where<br>\
my hair parts?]; (T, S;) i. e. مَا أَنَاوَطَلَبُ<br>\
الوَحْشِ بَعْدَ مَا كَبِرْتُ [i. e. مَا أمْرِي وَطَلَبُ الوَحْشِ:<br>\
in one copy of the S, وَطَلَبَ, i. e. with وَ as a<br>\
prep. denoting concomitance, and therefore governing the accus. case: both readings virtually<br>\
meaning what concern have I with the pursuing<br>\
of the wild animals after I have grown old?]:<br>\
he means, the girls: and the mention of أُمّ in<br>\
the verse is superfluous. (S.) ―<br>\
-b7-  أُمٌّ also relates<br>\
to inanimate things that have growth; as in<br>\
أُمُّ الشَّجَرَةِ [The mother of the tree]; and أُمُّ النَّخْلَةِ<br>\
[the mother of the palm-tree]; and أُمُّ المَوْزِةَ [the<br>\
mother of the banana-tree; of which see an ex.<br>\
in art. موز]; and the like. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And<br>\
it signifies also The source, origin, foundation,<br>\
or basis, (S, M, Msb, K,) of a thing, (S, Msb,<br>\
[in the former of which, this is the first of the<br>\
meanings assigned to the word,]) or of anything;<br>\
(M, K) its stay, support, or efficient cause of<br>\
subsistence. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b9-  Anything to which other<br>\
things are collected together, or adjoined: (IDrd,<br>\
M, K:) anything to which the other things that<br>\
are next thereto are collected together, or adjoined:<br>\
(Lth, T:) the main, or chief, part of a thing;<br>\
the main body thereof: and that which is a compriser, or comprehender, of [other] things: (Ham<br>\
p. 44:) the place of collection, comprisal, or comprehension, of a thing; the place of combination<br>\
thereof. (En-Nadr, T.) ―<br>\
-b10-  And hence, (IDrd,<br>\
M,) The head, or chief, of a people, or company<br>\
of men; (IDrd, S, M, K;) because others collect<br>\
themselves together to him: (IDrd, TA:) so<br>\
in the phrase أُمُّ عِيَالٍ [lit. the mother of a household], in a poem of Esh-Shenfarà: (IDrd, M:)<br>\
or in this instance, it has the signification next<br>\
following, accord. to Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee. (T.) ―<br>\
-b11-  A<br>\
man who has the charge of the food and service<br>\
of a people, or company of men; accord. to EshSháfi&#39;ee: (T:) or their servant. (K.) ―<br>\
-b12-  A<br>\
man&#39;s aged wife. (IAar, T, K.) ―<br>\
-b13-  A place of<br>\
habitation or abode. (K.) So in the Kur [ci. 6],<br>\
فَأُمُّهُ هَاوِيَةٌ His place of habitation or abode [shall<br>\
be] the fire [of Hell]: (Bd, Jel, TA:) or, as<br>\
some say, the meaning is أُمُّ رَأْسِهِ هَاوِيَةٌ فِيهَا [his<br>\
brain shall fall into it, namely, the fire of Hell].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b14-  The ensign, or standard, which an army<br>\
follows. (S.) [See أُمُّ الرُّمْحِ, below.] ―<br>\
-b15-  It is said<br>\
in a trad., respecting the prophets, أُمَّهَا تُهُمْ شَتَّى,<br>\
meaning that, though their religion is one, their<br>\
laws, or ordinances, or statutes, are various, or<br>\
different: or the meaning is, their times are<br>\
various, or different. (TA in art. شت.) ―<br>\
-b16-  See<br>\
also أُمَّةٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b17-  أُمّ is also prefixed to<br>\
nouns significant of many things. (M.) [Most<br>\
of the compounds thus formed will be found<br>\
explained in the arts. to which belong the nouns<br>\
that occupy the second place. The following are<br>\
among the more common, and are therefore here<br>\
mentioned, with the meanings assigned to them<br>\
in lexicons in the present art., and arranged in<br>\
distinct classes.] ―<br>\
-b18-  أُمُّ الرَّجُلِ The man&#39;s wife;<br>\
and the person who manages the affairs of his<br>\
house or tent. (TA.) And أُمُّ مَثْوَى الرَّجُلِ The<br>\
man&#39;s wife, to whom he betakes himself for lodging,<br>\
or abode: (T:)  the mistress of the man&#39;s place<br>\
of abode. (S, M.) ―<br>\
-b19-  أُمُّ عَامِرٍ The hyena, or<br>\
female hyena; as also أُمُّ عَمْرٍو; (TA;) and<br>\
أُمُّ الطَّرِيقِ. (S, TA. [See also other significations<br>\

-A5-  The stature of a man; tallness, and beauty of stature; or justness of stature;<br>\
syn. قَامَةٌ; (T, S, M, Msb, K;) and شَطَاطً: (M,<br>\
TA: [in the K, the signification of نَشَاطٌ is<br>\

the next three before the latter of them in the M;<br>\
and the next five after the former word in the K<br>\

-A2-  Accord. to IKtt, it<br>\

-b2-  [Near; nigh.]<br>\
You say, أَخَذْتُ ذلِكَ مِنْ أَمَمٍ I took that from<br>\

same; (T;) of a middle, or middling, kind  or<br>\
sort; neither exceeding, nor falling short of, what<br>\
is right; (AA, T, S, M;) applied to an affair, or<br>\
a case, (T, S,) and a thing [of any kind]; (S;)<br>\
as also ↓ مُؤَمٌّ; (TA;) and convenient, or suitable:<br>\
(M, K:) and أَمَمٌ and ↓ مُؤَامٌّ both signify an<br>\
affair, or a case, that is manifest, clear, or plain,<br>\
(M, K,) not exceeding the due bounds or limits.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
الأَمَامُ The location that is before; (M, Msb, *<br>\
K;) contr. of الوَرَآءُ. (M, K.) It is used [absolutely] as a noun, and adverbially, (M, Msb, * K,)<br>\
necessarily prefixed to another noun: (Mgh:)<br>\
and is fem., (Ks, M,) and sometimes mase.: (M,<br>\
K:) or it is mase., and sometimes fem. as meaning<br>\
the جِهَة: or, as Zj says, they differ as to making<br>\
it masc. and making it fem. (Msb.) You say,<br>\
كُنْتُ أَمَامَهُ I was before him, in respect of place.<br>\
(S.) In the saying of Mohammad, to Usámeh,<br>\
الصلَاةُ أَمَامَكَ, the meaning is The time of prayer<br>\
[is before thee], or the place thereof; and by the<br>\
prayer is meant the prayer of sunset. (Mgh.)<br>\
You also say, أَمَامَكَ [i. c. Look before thee;<br>\

you caution another, (M, K,) or notify him, of a<br>\

(Msb,) whose example is followed, or who is<br>\
imitated; (S, Mgh, Msb;) any exemplar, or<br>\
object of imitation, (T, M, K,) to a people, or<br>\
company of men, (T,) such as a head, chief, or<br>\
leader, or some other person, (M, K,) whether<br>\
they be following the right way or be erring<br>\
therefrom: (T:) applied alike to a male and to a<br>\
female: (Mgh, Msb:) applied to a female, it<br>\
occurs in a phrase in which it is written by some<br>\
with ة: (Mgh:) but this is said to be a mistake:<br>\
(Msb:) it is correctly without ة, because it is a<br>\
subst., not an epithet: (Mgh, Msb:) or it is<br>\
allowable with ة, because it implies the meaning<br>\
of an epithet: (Msb:) and ↓ أُمَّةٌ signifies the<br>\
same: (T, M, K:) the pl. of the former is أَيِمَّةْ,<br>\
(T, S, M, K, [but omitted in the CK,]) originally<br>\
أَأْمِمَةٌ, (T, S,) of the measure أَفعِلَةٌ, like أَمْثِلَةٌ,<br>\
pl. of مِثَالٌ, (T,) but as two meems come together,<br>\
the former is incorporated into the latter, and its<br>\
vowel is transferred to the hemzeh before it, which<br>\
hemzeh, being thus pronounced with kesr, is<br>\
changed into ى; (T, S; *) or it is thus changed<br>\
because difficult to pronounce; (M;) or, as Akh<br>\
says, because it is with kesr and is preceded by<br>\
another hemzeh with fet-h: (S:) but some pronounce it أَئِمَّةٌ, (Akh, T, S, M, K,) namely, those<br>\
who hold that two hemzehs may occur together;<br>\
(Akh, S;) the Koofees reading it thus in the<br>\
Kur ix. 12; (M;) but this is anomalous: (M,<br>\
K:) it is mentioned as on the authority of Aboo-Is-hák, and [Az says,] I do not say that it is not<br>\
allowable, but the former is the preferable: (T:)<br>\
or the pl. is أَئِمَّةٌ, originally أَأْمِمَةٌ like أَمْثِلَةٌ: one<br>\
of the two meems being incorporated into the<br>\
other after the transfer of its vowel to the hemzeh<br>\
[next before it]; some of the readers of the Kur<br>\
pronouncing the [said] hemzeh with its true<br>\
sound; some softening it, agreeably with analogy,<br>\
in the manner termed بَيْنَ بَيْنَ; and some of the<br>\
grammarians changing it into ى; but some of<br>\
them reckon this incorrect, saying that there is no<br>\
analogical reason for it: (Msb:) and accord. to<br>\
some, (M,) its pl. is also إِمَامُ, (M, K,) like the<br>\
sing., (K,) occurring in the Kur xxv. 74; (M;)<br>\
not of the same category as عَدْلٌ (M, K) and رِضَّى,<br>\
(M,) because they sometimes said إِمَامَانِ, but a<br>\
broken pl.: (M, K: *) or, accord. to A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
it is in this instance a sing. denoting a pl.: (M,<br>\
S: *) or it is pl. of آمٌّ, [which is originally آمِمْ,]<br>\
like as صِحَابٌ is pl. of صَاحِبٌ: (M:) the dim.<br>\
of أَيِمَّةٌ is ↓ أُوَيْمَّةْ; or, as El-Mázinee says, ↓ أُيَيْمَّةٌ.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الإمَامُ also signifies The Prophet: (K:)<br>\
he is called إِمَامُ [the exemplar, object of<br>\
imitation, leader, or head, of his nation, or people];<br>\
(T;) or إِمَامُ الأمَّةِ [the exemplar, &amp;c., of the nation, or people]; (M;) it being incumbent on all<br>\
to imitate his rule of life or conduct. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
The Khaleefeh: (Msb, K:) he is called إمَامُ الرَّعِيَّةِ<br>\
[the exemplar, &amp;c., of the people, or subjects].<br>\
(M.) The title of الإمَامُ is still applied to the<br>\
Kings of El-Yemen: Aboo-Bekr says, you say,<br>\
فُلَانٌ إِمَامُ القَوْمِ, meaning such a one is the first<br>\
in authority over the people, or company of men:<br>\
and إِمَامُ المَسْلِمِينَ means the head, chief, or<br>\
leader, of the Muslims. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The person<br>\
whose example is followed, or who is imitated,<br>\
[i. e. the leader,] in prayer. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [The<br>\
leading authority, or head, of a persuasion, or<br>\
sect. The four أيِمَّة or أَئِمَّة are the heads of the<br>\
four principal persuasions, or sects, of the Sunnees; namely, the Hanafees, Sháfi&#39;ees, Málikees,<br>\
and Hambelees. And the Hanafees call the two<br>\
chief doctors of their persuasion, after Aboo-<br>\
Haneefeh, namely, Aboo-Yoosuf and Mohammad,<br>\
الإِمَامَانِ The two Imáms.] ―<br>\
-b6-  The leader of an<br>\
army. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  The guide: (K:) he is called<br>\
إِمَامُ الإِبِلِ [the leader of the travellers]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
The conductor, or driver, of camels (M, K) is<br>\
called إِمَامُ الإِبِلِ, though he be behind them,<br>\
because he guides them. (M.) ―<br>\
-b9-  The manager,<br>\
or conductor, and right disposer, orderer, or<br>\
rectifier, of anything. (M, K. *) ―<br>\
-b10-  The Kur-án<br>\
(M, K) is called إِمَامُ المُسْلِمينَ [the guide of the<br>\
Muslims]; (M;) because it is an exemplar.<br>\
(TA.) [The model-copy, or standard-copy, of the<br>\
Kur-án, namely the copy of the Khaleefeh &#39;Othmán, is particularly called الإِمَامُ.] ―<br>\
-b11-  [The scripture of any people: and, without the article, a<br>\
book, or written record.] It is said in the Kur<br>\
[xvii. 73], يَوْمَ نَدْعُو كُلَّ أُنَاسٍ بِإمَامِهِمْ The day<br>\
when we shall call every one of mankind with<br>\
their scripture: or, as some say, with their<br>\
prophet and their law: or, as some say, with<br>\
their book in which their deeds are recorded. (T.)<br>\
It is also said in the Kur [xxxvi. 11], كُلَّ شَيْءٍ<br>\
أَحْصَيْنَاهُ فِى إِمَامٍ مُبِينٍ, meaning, says El-Hasan,<br>\
[And everything have we recorded] in a perspicuous book, or writing; (S, Jel;) i. e., on the<br>\
Preserved Tablet. (Bd, Jel.) ―<br>\
-b12-  The lesson of a<br>\
boy, that is learned each day (T, M, K) in the<br>\
school: (T:) also called السَّبَقُ. (TA.) ―<br>\

omitted in some copies,] M, K:) or a manifest<br>\

K;) i. e. one who raves, or is delirious, (يَهْذِى,<br>\

the M and K ↓ أمَيْمَةٌ, [in a copy of the M, however, I find it without any syll. signs, so that<br>\
it would seem to be ↓ أَمِيمَةٌ,] explained as signifying stones with which heads are broken: (TA:)<br>\
pl. أَمَائِمُ. (S, TA.)<br>\
أُمَائِمُ Three hundred camels: (M, K:) so explained by Abu-l-&#39;Alà. (M.)<br>\

الإِمِامِيَّةُ One of the exorbitant sects of the<br>\
Shee&#39;ah, (TA,) who asserted that &#39;Alee was expressly appointed by Mohammad to be his successor. (Esh-Shahrastánee p. 122, and KT.)<br>\
أُمَيْمِهةٌ [dim. of أُمَّهةٌ] : see أُمٌّ, first sentence.<br>\
أُمِّىٌّ (T, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ أُمَّانٌ (K) [the<br>\
former a rel. n. from أُمَّةٌ, and thus properly<br>\
meaning Gentile: whence, in a secondary, or<br>\
tropical, sense,(assumed tropical:) a heathen;] (assumed tropical:) one not having<br>\
a revealed scripture; (Bd in iii. 19 and 69;) so<br>\
applied by those having a revealed scripture:<br>\
(Bd in iii.69:) [and particularly] an Arab:<br>\
(Jel in iii. 69, and Bd and Jel in lxii. 2:) [or]<br>\
in the proper language [of the Arabs], of, or<br>\
belonging to, or relating to, the nation (أُمَّة) of<br>\
the Arabs, who did not write nor read: and<br>\
therefore metaphorically applied to (tropical:) any one not<br>\
knowing the art of writing nor that of reading:<br>\
(Mgh:) or (assumed tropical:) one who does not write; (T, M, K;)<br>\
because the art of writing is acquired; as though<br>\
he were thus called in relation to the condition<br>\
in which his mother (أُمَّهُ) brought him forth:<br>\
(T:) or (assumed tropical:) one who is in the natural condition of<br>\
the nation (الأُمَّة) to which he belongs, (Zj, * T, M, *<br>\
K, *) in respect of not writing, (T,) or not<br>\
having learned writing; thus remaining in his<br>\
natural state: (M, K:) or (assumed tropical:) one who does not<br>\
write well; said to be a rel. n. from أمٌّ; because<br>\
the art of writing is acquired, and such a person<br>\
is as his mother brought him forth, in respect of<br>\
ignorance of that art; or, as some say, from أُمَّةُ<br>\
العَرَبِ; because most of the Arabs were of this<br>\
description: (Msb:) the art of writing was known<br>\
among the Arabs [in the time of Mohammad] by<br>\
the people of Et-Táïf, who learned it from a man<br>\
of the people of El-Heereh, and these had it from<br>\
the people of El-Ambár. (T.) أُمِّيُّون لَا يَعْلَمُونَ,<br>\
الكِتَابَ, in the Kur ii. 73, means Vulgar persons,<br>\
[or heathen,] who know not the Book of the Law<br>\
revealed to Moses: (Jel:) or ignorant persons,<br>\
who know not writing, so that they may read that<br>\
book; or, who know not the Book of the Law<br>\
revealed to Moses. (Bd.) Mohammad was termed<br>\
أُمِّىّ [meaning A Gentile, as distinguished from<br>\
an Israelite: or, accord. to most of his followers,<br>\
meaning illiterate;] because the nation (أُمَّة) of<br>\
the Arabs did not write, nor read writing; and<br>\
[they say that] God sent him as an apostle when<br>\
he did not write, nor read from a book; and this<br>\
natural condition of his was one of his miraculous<br>\
signs, to which reference is made in the Kur<br>\
[xxix. 47], where it is said, “thou didst not read,<br>\
before it, from a book, nor didst thou write it<br>\
with thy right hand:” (T, TA:) but accord. to the<br>\
more correct opinion, he was not well acquainted<br>\
with written characters nor with poetry, but<br>\
he discriminated between good and bad poetry:<br>\
or, as some assert, he became acquainted with<br>\
writing after he had been unacquainted therewith, on account of the expression “ before it ”<br>\
in the verse of the Kur mentioned above: or, as<br>\
some say, this may mean that he wrote though<br>\
ignorant of the art of writing, like as some<br>\
of the kings, being أُمِّيُّون, write their signs, or<br>\
marks: (TA:) or, accord. to Jaafar Es-Sádik,<br>\
he used to read from the book, or scripture, if<br>\
he did not write. (Kull p. 73.) [Some judicious<br>\
observations on this word are comprised in Dr.<br>\
Sprenger&#39;s Life of Mohammad (pp. 101-2);<br>\
a work which, in the portion already published<br>\
(Part I.), contains much very valuable information.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K,) or [only] أُمِّىٌّ, (AZ, T, M,)<br>\
applied to a man, (AZ, T,) Impotent in speech,<br>\
(عَيِىّ, in the K incorrectly written غَبِىّ, TA,)<br>\
of few words, and rude, churlish, uncivil, or<br>\
surly. (AZ, T, M, K.)<br>\
أُمِّيَّةٌ The quality denoted by the epithet أُمِّىٌّ:<br>\
(TA:) [gentilism: (assumed tropical:) heathenism: &amp;c.:] (assumed tropical:) the<br>\
quality of being [in the natural condition of<br>\
the nation to which one belongs, or] as brought<br>\
forth by one&#39;s mother, in respect of not having<br>\
learned the art of writing nor the reading thereof.<br>\

أُمَّانٌ: see أُمِّىٌّ; and see also art. امن<br>\
أُمَّهَدٌ: see أُمٌّ.<br>\
آمٌّ [act. part. n. of 1;] i. q. قَاصِدٌ: [see 1, first<br>\
sentence:] (TA:) pl. إِمَامٌ, like as صِحَابٌّ is<br>\
pl. of صَاحِبٌ, (M, K,) accord. to some, but others<br>\
say that this is pl. of إِمَامٌ [q. v.; the sing. and<br>\
pl. being alike]; (M;) and آمُّونَ. (TA.) Hence,<br>\
in the Kur [v. 2], وَلَا آمِّينَ الْبَيْتَ الْحَرَامَ [Nor<br>\
those repairing to the Sacred House]. (TA.)<br>\
آمَّةٌ (S, Msb) and ↓ مَأْمُومَةٌ, as some of the<br>\
Arabs say, (IB, Msb,) because it implies the<br>\
meaning of a pass. part. n., originally; (Msb;)<br>\
but &#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh says that this is a mistake;<br>\
for the latter word is an epithet applied to the<br>\
part called أُمُّ الدِّمَاغِ when it is broken; (IB;)<br>\
or شَجَّةٌ آمَّةٌ and ↓ مَأْمُومَةٌ; (M, Mgh, K;) A<br>\
wound by which the head is broken, (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K,) reaching to the part called أُمُّ الدِّمَاغِ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) or, [which means the same,] أُمُّ الرَّأْسِ,<br>\
(M, K,) so that there remains between it and<br>\
the brain [only] a thin skin: (S:) it is the most<br>\
severe of شِجَاج [except that which reaches the<br>\
brain (see شَجَّةٌ)]: ISk says that the person<br>\
suffering from it roars, or bellows, (يَصْعَقُ,) like<br>\
thunder, and like the braying of camels, and<br>\
is unable to go forth into the sun: (Msb:) the<br>\
mulct for it is one third of the whole price of<br>\
blood: (TA:) IAar assigns the meaning of [this<br>\
kind of] شَجَّة to ↓ أَمَّةٌ; which seems, therefore,<br>\
to be either a dial. var. or a contraction of آمَّةٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) the pl. of آمَّةٌ is أَوَامُّ (Mgh, Msb) and<br>\
↓ مآئِمُ; or this latter has no proper sing.: (M,<br>\
TA:) the pl. of ↓ مأْمُومَةٌ is مَأْمُومَاتٌ. (Mgh,<br>\
Msb.)<br>\
أَوَمُّ and أَيَمُّ Better in the performance of the<br>\
office termed إِمَامَةٌ; followed by مِنْ: (Zj, T, M,<br>\
K:) originally أَأَمُّ: the second hemzeh being<br>\
changed by some into و and by some into ى.<br>\
(Zj, T, M.)<br>\
أُيَيْمَّةٌ, or أُيَيْمَّةٌ, dim. of أَيِمَّةٌ, pl. of إِمَامٌ,<br>\
q. v. (S.)<br>\
مُؤمٌّ: see أَمَمٌ.<br>\
مِئَمٌّ A camel that leads and guides: (M:) or<br>\
a guide that shows the right way: and a camel<br>\
that goes before the other camels: (K:) fem.<br>\
with ة; (M, K;) applied to a she-camel (M, TA)<br>\
that goes before the other she-camels, and is<br>\
followed by them. (TA.)<br>\
مأْمُومٌ: see أَمِيمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A camel having his<br>\
hump bruised internally by his being much ridden,<br>\
or having his hump swollen in consequence of the<br>\
galling of the saddle and the cloth beneath it,<br>\
and bruised, and having his hump corroded:<br>\
(S:) or whose fur has gone from his back in<br>\
consequence of beating, or of galls, or sores, produced by the saddle or the like. (M, K.) ―<br>\
