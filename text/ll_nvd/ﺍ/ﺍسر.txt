اَسِرَ, inf. n. أَسْرٌ (S, M, K)<br>\
and إِسَارٌ, (M, TA,) He bound, braced, or tied,<br>\
him, [namely, his captive,] or it, (S, M, A, K,)<br>\
namely, his قَتَب [or camel&#39;s saddle], (S, A,) or<br>\
his horse&#39;s saddle, (A,) with an إِسَار, i. e. a thong<br>\
of untanned hide, (S, A,) by tying the two extremities of the عَرْقُوْتَانِ of the camel&#39;s saddle, or<br>\
of the curved pieces of wood of the horse&#39;s saddle.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, aor. as above, and so the inf. n.,<br>\
i. e. أَسْرٌ (S, Msb) and إِسَارٌ, (Lth, S,) He made<br>\
him a captive; captived him; or took him a<br>\
prisoner; whether he bound him with an إِسَار<br>\
or did not; (S;) as also ↓ آسرهُ, of the same form<br>\
as أَكْرَمَ; (Msb;) and ↓ استأسرهُ, accord. to a<br>\
trad., in which it occurs thus used, transitively:<br>\
(Mgh:) and he imprisoned him. (TA, from a<br>\
trad.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (S, Msb,) inf. n. أَسْرٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He (God) created him, or formed him, (S,<br>\
Msb,) in a goodly manner. (Msb.) You say,<br>\
أَسَرَهُ اللّٰهُ أَحْسَنَ الأَسْرِGod created him, or formed<br>\
him, in the best manner. (Fr, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  أُسِرَ, (S,<br>\
A,) aor. يُؤْسَرُ; (S;) or أَسِرَ, aor. يَأْسَرُ; (IKtt;) or<br>\
أُسِرَ بَوْلُهُ; (M;) inf. n. أَسْرٌ, (M, and so in a<br>\
copy of the S,) or the latter is a simple subst.;<br>\
(M, IKtt;) He (a man, S, A) suffered suppression of his urine. (S, M, IKtt, A.) [See أُسْرٌ,<br>\
below.]<br>\
2<br>\
أسّرHe bound, or tied, tight, fast, or<br>\
firmly. (So accord. to Golius; but for this he<br>\
names no authority.)]<br>\
4<br>\
آسَرَ see 1.<br>\
5<br>\
تأسّر عَلَيْهِ فُلَانٌ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one excused himself<br>\
to him, and was slow, or tardy: (AZ, T, K:*)<br>\
thus as related by Ibn-Hánee from AZ: as<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd relates it from him, تأسن; but this is a<br>\
mistake: it is correctly with ر. (T.)<br>\
8<br>\
يَأْتَسِرُ, inf. n. ائْتِسَارٌ [written with the disjunctive alif اِيتِسَارٌ]; for يَتَّسِرُ, inf. N. اتِّسَارٌ: see<br>\
art. يسر.<br>\
10<br>\
استأسر لِلْعَدُوِ He submitted himself as a<br>\
captive to the enemy. (Mgh.) You say, اِسْتَأْسِرْ,<br>\
meaning Be thou a captive to me. (S,)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also 1.<br>\
أَسْرٌ i. q. إِسَارٌ, q. v. (S.) Hence the saying,<br>\
هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ لَكَ بِأَسْرِهِ This thing is for thee, or is<br>\
thine,[lit.] with its thong of untanned hide<br>\
[wherewith it is bound]; meaning, altogether;<br>\
like as one says, بِرُمَّتِهِ. (S.) And خُذْهُ بِأَسْرِهِ<br>\
Take thou it all, or altogether. (Msb.) And<br>\
جَآءَ القَوْمُ بِأَسْرِهِمْ The people came altogether.<br>\
(Aboo-Bekr.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Strength of make, or form. (M,<br>\
K.) [Accord. to the copies of the K in my<br>\
hands, it also signifies Strength of natural disposition; but instead of وَالخُلُق, in those copies,<br>\
we should read وَالخَلْقُ, agreeably with other<br>\
lexicons, as is implied in the TA: see 1.] You<br>\
say, فُلَانٌ شَدِيدٌ أَسْرٍ الخَلْقِ (tropical:)  Such a one is of<br>\
strong, firm, or compact, make, or form. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  شَدَدْنَا أَسْرَهُمْ, in the Kur [lxxvi. 28], means<br>\
(tropical:)  We have strengthened their make, or form:<br>\
(S, A, Msb:) or, their joints: or, their two<br>\
sphincters which serve as repressers of the urine<br>\
and feces (مَصَرَّتَىِ البَوْلِ وَ الغَائِطِ), which contract<br>\
when the excrement has passed forth; or the<br>\
meaning is, that these two things do not become<br>\
relaxed before one desires. (IAar, K.)<br>\
أُسْرٌ, (S, M, IKtt, A,) a subst., (M, IKtt,) as<br>\
also ↓ أُسُرٌ, (M, Lb,) meaning Suppression of the<br>\
urine: (S, M, &amp;c.:) suppression of the feces<br>\
is termed حُصْرٌ: (S:) or a dribbling of the urine,<br>\
with a cutting pain in the bladder, and pangs<br>\
like those of a female in the time of parturition.<br>\
(IAar.) You say, أَخَذَهُ الأَسْرُ [Suppression of<br>\
urine, &amp;c., took him, or affected him]. (A.) And<br>\
أَنَالَهُ اللّٰهُ أُسْراً [May God give him a suppression<br>\
of urine, &amp;c.]: a form of imprecation. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, (M,) عُودُ أُسْرٍ (IAar, S, M, A, K) and<br>\
عُودٌ أُسْرٌ and عُودُ الأُسْرِ (Expositions of the Fs)<br>\
and عُودُ يُسْرِ, (IAar, K,) or this is a corruption,<br>\
(K,) or a vulgar mistake, (A,) and should not<br>\
be said, (Fr, S, A,) unless meant to be used as<br>\
ominous of good, (A,) A stick, or piece of wood,<br>\
which is put upon the belly of a man affected by<br>\
a suppression of his urine, (S, A, K, &amp;c.,) and<br>\
which cures him. (A.)<br>\
أُسُرٌ: see أُسْرٌ.<br>\
أُسْرَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A man&#39;s kinsmen that are more, or  most,<br>\
nearly related to him; his near kinsmen: (S, *<br>\
M, A, * Msb, * K:) or a man&#39;s nearer, or nearest,<br>\
relations on his father&#39;s side: (Aboo-Jaafar En-Nahhás:) so called because he is strengthened<br>\
by them. (S, A.)<br>\
إِسَارٌ A thing with which one binds; (M, K;)<br>\
a thong of untanned hide, (S, A, Msb,) with<br>\
which one binds a camel&#39;s saddle, (As, S,) [as<br>\
also إِصَارٌ,] and a captive; and so أَسْرٌ, q. v.:<br>\
(S:) and a rope, or cord, with which a captive<br>\
is bound: and a pair of shackles: (TA:) pl.<br>\
أُسُرٌ. (M, K.) [See also 1.] You say, حَلَّ إِسَارَهُ<br>\
فَأَطْلَقَهُ He untied his thong of untanned hide<br>\
wherewith he was bound, and released him. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  See also أَسِيرٌ.<br>\
أَسِيرٌ i. q. ↓ مَأْسُورٌ; (S, TA;) Bound with an<br>\
إِسَار: (M, TA:) shackled: (K:) imprisoned:<br>\
(Mujáhid, M, K:) captived, or a captive; (S,<br>\
M, K;) absolutely, (TA,) although not bound<br>\
with an اسار: (S:) and ↓ إِسَارٌ is sometimes used<br>\
in the same sense. (Msb.) اسير is also applied as<br>\
an epithet to a woman, (Mgh, Msb,) when the<br>\
woman is mentioned; but otherwise أَسِيرَةٌ is used<br>\
as the fem.: you say, قَتَلْتُ الأَسِيرَةَ [I slew the<br>\
female captive], like as you say, رَأَيْتُ القَتِيلَةَ.<br>\
(Msb.) The pl. is أَسْرَى (S, M, Msb, K) and<br>\
أَسَرَآءُ (M, K) and (accord. to several authors, pls.<br>\
of أَسْرَى, TA) أُسَارَى (S, M, Msb, K) and أَسَارَى:<br>\
(M, K:) the first of these forms of pl. is proper<br>\
to epithets applied to those who are hurt or<br>\
afflicted in their bodies or their intellects: (Aboo-Is-hák:) it is used in this instance because a<br>\
captive is like one wounded or stung. (Th, M.)<br>\
تَآسِيرُ السَّرْجِ [in the CK, erroneously, تَأْسِير]<br>\
The thongs of the horse&#39;s saddle, whereby it is<br>\
bound: (K:) accord. to the more correct opinion,<br>\
a pl. without a sing. (MF.)<br>\
مَأْسُورٌ: see أَسِيرٌ. A camel&#39;s saddle bound with<br>\
an إِسَار: pl. مَآسِيرُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A man, and a<br>\
beast, having strongly-knit joints. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A<br>\
man suffering suppression of his urine. (S.)<br>\
