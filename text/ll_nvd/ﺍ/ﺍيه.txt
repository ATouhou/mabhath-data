ايّه بِهَا, (S, TA,) and, accord. to some, بِهِمْ<br>\
(TA,) and بِهِ, (K, * TA,) inf. n. تَأْيِيهٌ, (S, K,) He<br>\
cried out to, or shouted to, and called, (S, K, TA,)<br>\
them, namely, camels, (S, TA,) and, accord. to<br>\
some, horses, and men, (TA,) and him, (K, TA,)<br>\
namely, a camel: (TA:) or ايّه به signifies he<br>\
said to him, namely, a man, and a horse, يَا وَيْهَاهْ<br>\
[Ho! On!]: (A &#39;Obeyd:) and he said to him,<br>\
namely, a man, يَا أَيُّهَا الرَّجُلُ [O thou man]: (K:)<br>\
or he called him, يا ايّها الرجل: (IAth:) and he cried out<br>\
to him, or at him; or drove him away with<br>\
crying or a cry; namely, an object of the chase.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
أَيْهَ would seem to be a dial. var. of وَيْهَ; for<br>\
it is said that] أَيْهَكَ is syn. with وَيْهَكَ. (K: [but<br>\
see وَيْهَ.])<br>\
-A2-  أَيْهًا: see أَيْهَاتَ.<br>\
إِيهْ, with the ه quiescent, is a word used in<br>\
chiding, or checking; meaning حَسْبُكَ [Sufficient<br>\
for thee is such a thing; &amp;c.]. (ISd, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
إِيهًا signifies, (S, K,) as also ايهَ, (K,) a command<br>\
to be silent, (S, K,) and to abstain; (S, TA;)<br>\
i. e. Be silent; and abstain, or desist: (TA:)<br>\
both are used in chiding, or checking: and هِيهَ is<br>\
used in the place of إِيهَ. (Lth, TA.) You say<br>\
[also,] إِيهًا عَنَّا Be silent, and abstain from [troubling] us. (S, TA.) And إِيهَا عَنِّى الْآنَ Abstain<br>\
thou from [Troubling] me now. (AZ, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
إِيهًا also occurs as meaning I hold that to be true,<br>\
and approve it. (IAth, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  إِيهِ, as also إِيهَ<br>\
and إِيهٍ, is a word denoting a desire, or demand,<br>\
for one to add, or to give, or do, more; (Lth,<br>\
K;) and a desire for one to speak: (K:) it (i. e.<br>\
إِيهِ) is an imperative verbal noun, (S,) indecl.,<br>\
with kesr for its termination: (K:) you say to a<br>\
man, when you desire, or demand, his telling or<br>\
saying more of a [certain] story or subject of discourse, or his doing more of a [certain] deed, إِيهِ,<br>\
with kesr. to the ه; (S;) [i. e. Tell me, or say,<br>\
more of this; say on; go on, or proceed, with<br>\
this; or do more of this;] and افْعَلْ إِيهِ [Go on,<br>\
or proceed, with this; do it]; (AZ;) and for<br>\
إِيهِ, you say, هِيهِ: (Lth:) but when you make<br>\
no interruption after it, you pronounce it with<br>\
tenween, (ISk, S, K,) and say إِيهٍ, (ISk, S,)<br>\
which means حَدِّثْنَا [i. e. Tell us, or relate to us,<br>\
something]; (Ks, Lh, (ISk, * S; *) and for this<br>\
one says هِيهٍ, by substitution of one letter for<br>\
another: (Ks, Lh:) or it means زِدْ [i. e. tell, or<br>\
say, or do, something more]; and هَاتِ [i. e. give,<br>\
or relate, something]; (Har p. 592;) and تَكَلَّمَ<br>\
[i. e. speak]. (Idem p. 419.) In the following<br>\
saying of Dhu-r-Rummeh,<br>\
وَقَفْنَا وَ قُلْنَا إِيهِ عَنْ أُمِّ سَالِمٍ<br>\
وَ مَا بَالُ تَكْلِيمِ الدِّيَارِ البَلَاقِعِ<br>\
[We stopped, and we said, Tell us some tidings:<br>\
inform us (أَخْبِرِينَا being app. understood) respecting Umm-Sálim: but what is the case (meaning<br>\
what is the use) of speaking to the vacant dwellings?], he has used the word without tenween,<br>\
though making no interruption after it, because<br>\
he intended a pause. (ISk, S.) Ibn-Es-Seree<br>\
says, When you say, إِيهِ يَا رَجُلُ, you only command him to tell you more of the subject of<br>\
discourse known to you and him, as though<br>\
you said, هَاتِ الحَدِيثَ [Give, or relate, the story,<br>\
or narrative, O man]: but if you say, إِيهٍ, with<br>\
tenween, it is as though you said, هَاتِ حَدِيثًا مَّا<br>\
[Give, or relate, some story or narrative], because<br>\
the tenween renders indeterminate: and Dhu-rRummeh meant the tenween, but omitted it<br>\
through necessity. (S.) As says that Dhu-rRummeh has committed a mistake; the expression of the Arabs being only إِيهٍ [in a case of this<br>\
kind]: ISd says, the truth is, that it is without<br>\
tenween when determinate, and with tenween<br>\
when indeterminate; and that Dhu-r-Rummeh<br>\
asks the ruins to tell him more of a known<br>\
story, as though he said, Relate to us the story,<br>\
or tell us the tidings: (TA:) Aboo-Bekr Ibn-Es-Sarráj says, citing this verse, that ايه is not<br>\
known in a case of this kind without tenween<br>\
in any of the dialects; meaning that it is never<br>\
conjoined with a following word unless it be<br>\
with tenween. (IB, TA.)<br>\
أَيْهَا: see what next follows.<br>\
أَيْهَاتَ i. q. هَيْهَاتَ [Far, or far from being<br>\
believed or from the truth, is such a thing: or<br>\
remoteness, or remoteness from being believed or<br>\
from the truth, is to be attributed to such a<br>\
thing.]: as also ↓ أَيْهَانِ, (S, K,) and ↓ أَيْهَانَ, (K,<br>\
TA, in the CK اَيْهَانُ,) [and several other dial.<br>\
vars., for which see هَيْهَاتَ,] and ↓ أَيْهَا, (TA;<br>\
and so in some copies of the S and K; in other<br>\
copies of these, ↓ أَيْهًا; [but the former is app.<br>\
the right;]) with the ن [or the ت] suppressed,<br>\
(TA,) which is said in pronouncing [a thing] to<br>\
be remote [whether in a proper or a tropical sense]:<br>\
(S, TA:) Th explains ↓ أَيْهَانِ as meaning بَعِيدٌ<br>\
ذٰلِكَ AA explains it as meaning بَعُدَ ذٰلِكَ, making<br>\
it a verbal noun; and this is the correct explanation: (TA:) or the meaning is البُعْدُ, [as I have<br>\
indicated above,] (K in art. هيه,) but this is only<br>\
when لِ is prefixed to what follows it, as Sb says.<br>\
(TA. [See هَيْهَاتَ.])<br>\
أَيْهَانَ and أَيْهَانِ: see أَيْهَاتَ, in three places.<br>\
أَيِّهٌ Having a strong, or loud, voice; and<br>\
vigilant, or wary. (Ham p. 675.)<br>\
أَيُّهَا: see أَىٌّ; last portion of the paragraph.<br>\
