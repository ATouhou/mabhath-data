أَخَوْتَ, [third pers. أَخَا,] (S, K,) aor. تَأْخُو,<br>\
(S,) inf. n. أُخُوَّةٌ; (S, K, &amp;c.;) and ↓ آخَيْتَ, (K,<br>\
TA,) [in the CK اَخَيْتُ, which is wrong in<br>\
respect of the pers., and otherwise, for it is correctly] with medd, (TA,) inf. n. إِخَآءٌ and مُؤَاخَاةٌ;<br>\
(Lth;) and ↓ تَأَخَّيْتَ; (K;) Thou becamest a<br>\
brother [in the proper sense of this word, and also<br>\
as meaning a friend, or companion, or the like].<br>\
(S,* K,* TA.) ↓أُخُوَّةٌ is also [used as] a simple<br>\
subst., (TA,) signifying Brotherhood; fraternity;<br>\
the relation of brother; as also ↓إِخَآءٌ and مُؤَاخاةٌ;<br>\
and ↓تَأَخٍ: (Lth, TA:) and the relation of sister.<br>\
(S.) You say, بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَهُ أُخُوَّةٌ and ↓إِخَآءٌ [&amp;c.,<br>\
meaning] Between me and him is brotherhood.<br>\
(JK, TA.) And ↓بَيْنَ السَّمَاحَةِ وَالحَمَاسَةِ تَأَخٍ (assumed tropical:) [Between liberality and courage is a relation like that<br>\
of brothers]. (TA.) And خُوَّةٌ is a dial. var. of<br>\
أُخُوَّةٌ, occurring in a trad. (IAth, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [It is<br>\
also trans.] You say, أَخَوْتُ عَشَرَةً I was, or became, a brother to ten. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
أَخَّيْتُ لِلدَّابَّةِ, (S, K,) or الدَّابَّةَ, (Msb, [so<br>\
accord. to a copy of that work, but probably this<br>\
is a mistranscription,]) inf. n. تَأْخِيَةٌ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) I made an آخِيَّة [q. v.] for the beast, (Msb,<br>\
K,) and tied the beast therewith; (Msb;) [and<br>\
so, app., ↓ آخَيْتُ (which, if correct, is probably<br>\
of the measure أَفْعَلْتُ); for it is related that] an<br>\
Arab of the desert said to another, لِى آخِيَّةً ↓ آخِ<br>\
أَرْبِطُ إَلَيْهَا مُهْرِى [Make thou for me an آخيّة to<br>\
which I shall tie my colt]. (TA.) And you say,<br>\
فُلَانٌ فِى فُلَانٍ آخِيَّةً فَكَفَرَهَا ↓ آخِى (assumed tropical:)  Such a one<br>\
did a benefit to such a one, and he was ungrateful<br>\
for it. (TA.) [But perhaps آخِ and آخَى in<br>\
these two exs. are mistranscriptions for أَخِّ and<br>\
أَخَّى.]<br>\
3<br>\
آخاهُ, (S, K,) vulgarly وَاخَاهُ, (S,) or the<br>\
latter is a dial. var. of weak authority, (K,* TA,)<br>\
said by some to be of the dial. of Teiyi, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. مُؤَاخَاةٌ and إِخآءٌ (S, K) and وِخَآءٌ, (K) and<br>\
[quasi-inf. n.] ↓ إِخَاوَةٌ (Fr, K) and وِخَاوَةٌ, (CK,)<br>\
He fraternized with him; acted with him in a<br>\
brotherly manner: (S,* K,* PS, TK:) A&#39;Obeyd<br>\
mentions, on the authority of Yz, آخَيْتُ and<br>\
وَاخَيْتُ, and آسَيْتُ and وَاسَيْتُ, and آكَلْتُ and<br>\
وَاكَلْتُ: the pret. is said to be thus assimilated<br>\
to [a form of] the fut.; for they used [sometimes]<br>\
to say, يُوَاخِى, changing the hemzeh into و. (IB,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in a trad., آخَى بَيْنَ المُهَاجِرِينَ<br>\
وَالأَنْصَارِ, meaning He united the emigrants [to<br>\
El-Medeeneh] with the assistants [previously dwel-ling there] by the brotherhood of El-Islám and<br>\
of the faith. (TA.) You say also, آخَيْتُ بَيْنَ<br>\
الشَّيْئَنْنِ [I united the two things as fellows, or<br>\
pairs]; and sometimes one says, وَاخَيْتُ, like as<br>\
one says, وَاسَيْتُ, for آسَيْتُ; mentioned by ISk.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 1, in three places.<br>\

آخَوَ see 2, in three places.<br>\
5<br>\
تَأَخَّيْتَ, and the inf.n. تَأَخٍ: see 1, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  تَأَخَّيْتُ أَخًا I adopted a brother: (S, K:) or<br>\
[تَأَخَّيْتُهُ signifies] I called him brother. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
تَأَخَّيْتُ الشَّىْءَ, (S, K, TA,) or بِالشَّىْ, (Msb,) I<br>\
sought, endeavoured after, pursued, or endeavoured<br>\
to reach or attain or obtain, the thing; (S, Msb,<br>\
K, TA;) as the brother does the brother; and in<br>\
the same manner the verb is used with a man for<br>\
its object: but تَوَخَّيْتُ, in the same sense, is more<br>\
common. (TA.) You say, تَأَخَّيْتُ مَحَبَّتَكَ I<br>\
sought, &amp;c., thy love, or affection. (TA in art.<br>\
وخى.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَآخَيَا They became brothers, or friends or<br>\
companions or the like, to each other. (S,* TA.)<br>\
أَخٌ, (S, Msb, K,) originally أَخَوٌ, (Kh, S, Msb,)<br>\
as is shown by the first of its dual forms mentioned below, and by its having a pl. like آبَآءٍ,<br>\
(S,) and أَخٌّ, (K,) with the second letter doubled to<br>\
compensate for the و suppressed, as is the case in<br>\
أَبٌّ, (TA,) and ↓ أَخًا, [like أَبًا,] and ↓ أَخُو, (IAar,<br>\
K, TA, [the last, with the article prefixed to it,<br>\
erroneously written in the CK الاُخُوٌّ,]) and ↓ أَخْوٌ,<br>\
like دَلْوٌ, (Kr, K,) a well-known term of relationship, (K, TA,) i. e. A brother; the son of one&#39;s<br>\
father and mother, or of either of them: and also<br>\
applied to a foster-brother: (TA:) and (assumed tropical:) a friend;<br>\
and a companion, an associate, or a fellow: (K:)<br>\
derived from آخِيَّةٌ [q. v.]; as though one أَخ were<br>\
tied and attached to another like as the horse is<br>\
tied to the آخيّة: (Har p. 42 :) or, accord. to<br>\
some of the grammarians, it is from وَخَى meaning<br>\
قَصَدَ; because the أَخ has the same aim, endeavour,<br>\
or desire, as his أَخ: (TA:) when أَخ is prefixed<br>\
to another noun, its final vowel is prolonged:<br>\
(Kh:) you say, هذَا أَخُوكَ [This is thy brother,<br>\
&amp;c.], and مَرَرْتُ بِأَخِيكَ [I passed by thy brother,<br>\
&amp;c.], and رَأَيْتُ أَخَاكَ [I saw thy brother, &amp;c.] :<br>\
(S: [in which it is also asserted that one does not<br>\
say أَخُو without prefixing it to another noun;<br>\
but this is inconsistent with the assertion of IAar<br>\
and F, that الأَخُو is a syn. of الأَخُ:]) the dual is<br>\
أَخَوَانِ, (S, Msb, Kur xlix. 10, Ham p. 434,) or<br>\
أَخْوَانِ, with the خ quiescent, (TA, [but this I<br>\
have found nowhere else,]) and some of the Arabs<br>\
say أَخَانِ, (S, Msb,) and Kr mentions أَخُوَانِ,<br>\
with damm to the خ, said by IB to occur in<br>\
poetry, and held by ISd to be dual of أَخُو, with<br>\
damm to the خ: (TA:) the pl. is إِخْوَةٌ and إِخْوَانٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) the former generally applied<br>\
to brothers, and the latter to friends [or the like],<br>\
(T, S,*) but not always, as in the Kur xlix. 10,<br>\
where the former does not denote relationship,<br>\
and in xxiv. 60 of the same, where the latter does<br>\
denote relationship, (T, TA,) and sometimes the<br>\
former is applied to a [single] man, as in the<br>\
Kur iv. 12, (S,) and أُخْوَةٌ, (Fr, S, Msb, K, [in<br>\
the CK اَخْوَةٌ,]) or this is a quasi-pl. n., (Sb, TA,)<br>\
and أُخْوَانٌ, (Kr, Msb, K,) and آخَآءٌ, (S, K,) like<br>\
آبَآءٌ, (S,) and أُخُوٌّ, and أُخُوَّةٌ, (ISd, K,) the last<br>\
mentioned by Lh, and thought by ISd to be<br>\
formed from the next preceding by the addition<br>\
of ة characterizing the pl. as fem., (TA,) and<br>\
أَخُونَ, (S, Msb, K,) and اخاوون. (Msb: [there<br>\
written without any syll. signs, and I have not<br>\
found it elsewhere.]) The fem. of أَخٌ is ↓ أُخْتٌ<br>\
[meaning A sister: and (assumed tropical:)  a female friend, &amp;c.]:<br>\
(S, Msb, K, &amp;c. :) written with damm to show<br>\
that the letter which has gone from it is و; (S;)<br>\
the ت being a substitute for the و; (TA;) not to<br>\
denote the fem. gender, (K, TA,) because the<br>\
letter next before it is quiescent: this is the<br>\
opinion of Sb, and [accord. to SM] it is the correct opinion: for Sb says that if you were to use<br>\
it as a proper name of a man, you would make it<br>\
perfectly decl.; and if the ت were to denote the<br>\
fem. gender, the name would not be perfectly<br>\
decl.; though in one place he incidentally says<br>\
that it is the sign of the fem. gender, through<br>\
inadvertence: Kh, however, says that its ت is<br>\
[originally] ه [meaning ة]: and Lth, that أُخْتٌ<br>\
is originally أَخَةٌ: and some say that it is originally أَخْوَةٌ: (TA:) the dual. is أُخْتَانِ: (Kh:)<br>\
and the pl. is أَخَوَاتٌ. (Kh, S, Msb, K.) The<br>\
saying لَا أَخَالَكَ بِفُلَانٍ [Thou hast no brother, or<br>\
(assumed tropical:) friend, in such a one] means لَيْسَ لَكَ بِأَخٍ [such a<br>\
one is not a brother, or friend, to thee]. (S, K.)<br>\
It is said in a prov., مَنْ لَكَ بِأَخِيكَ كُلِّهِ [Who<br>\
will be responsible to thee for thy brother, or (assumed tropical:)  thy<br>\
friend, altogether? i. e., for his always acting to<br>\
thee as a brother, or friend]. (JK.) And in<br>\
another, رُبَّ أَخٍ لَكَ لَمْ تَلِدْهُ أُمُّكَ [(assumed tropical:)  There is many<br>\
a brother to thee whom thy mother has not brought<br>\
forth]. (TA.) And in another, أَخُوكَ أَمِ الذَّئْبُ<br>\
[Is it thy brother, or the wolf?]; said in suspecting a thing: as also أَخُوكَ أَمِ اللَّيْلُ [Is it thy<br>\
brother, or is it the night that deceives thee?].<br>\
(Har p. 554.) And another saying is, الرُّمْحُ أَخُوكَ<br>\
وَرُبَّمَا خَانَكَ [(assumed tropical:) The spear is thy brother, but sometimes, or often, it is unfaithful to thee]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Ibn-&#39;Arafeh says that when أُخُوَّةٌ does not<br>\
relate to birth, it means conformity, or similarity;<br>\
and combination, agreement, or unison, in action:<br>\
hence the saying, هذَا الثَّوْبُ أَخُو هذَا [(assumed tropical:) This<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth, is the like, or fellow,<br>\
of this] : and hence the saying in the Kur [xvii.<br>\
29], كَانُوا إِخْوَانَ الشَّيَاطِينِ  (assumed tropical:)  They are the likes,<br>\
or fellows, of the devils: and in the same [xliii. 47],<br>\
↓ إِلَّا هِىَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أُخْتِهَا (assumed tropical:)  But it was greater than<br>\
its like, or fellow; i. e., than what was like to it<br>\
in truth &amp;c. (TA.) It is said in a trad., النَّوْمُ<br>\
أَخُ المَوْتِ [Sleep is the like of death]. (El-Jámi&#39;<br>\
es-Sagheer.) One says also, لَقِىَ فُلَانٌ أَخَا المَوْتِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Such a one met with the like of death. (Msb,<br>\
TA.) And they said, لَهَا ↓ وَمَاهُ آللّٰهُ بِلَيْلَپٍ لَا أُخْتَ<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  God afflicted him with a night having none like to<br>\
it], i. e., a night in which he should die. (TA.) And<br>\
لَا أُكَلِّمُهُ إِلَّا أَخَا السِّرارِ (assumed tropical:)  I will not speak to him<br>\
save the like of secret discourse. (As, TA.) [And<br>\
hence,] سُهَيْلٍ ↓ أُخْتَا [(assumed tropical:)  The two sisters of Canopus;]<br>\
the two stars called الشّعْرَى العَبُورُ and الشّعْرَى<br>\
الغُمَيْصَآءُ. (S and K in art. شعر, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b3-  يَاَ أَخَا بَكْرٍ,<br>\
or تَمِيمٍ, means (assumed tropical:)  O thou of [the tribe of] Bekr, or<br>\
Temeem. (Ham p. 284.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Lh mentions, on the<br>\
authority of Abu-d-Deenár and Ibn-Ziyád, the<br>\
saying, القُمْمُ بِأَخِى الشَّرَّ, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  The people,<br>\
or company of men, are in an evil state or condition. (TA.) [But accord. to others,] one says,<br>\
تَرَكْتُهُ بِأَخِى الخَيْرِ, meaning (tropical:)  I left him in an<br>\
evil state or condition: (JK, * Msb, K, TA:) and<br>\
بِأَخِى الشَّرِّ (tropical:)  in a good state or condition. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  You say also, هُوَأَخُو الصَّدْقِ (assumed tropical:)  He is one who<br>\
cleaves, or keeps, to veracity. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [أِخُو, as<br>\
a prefixed noun, is also used in the sense of أَهْلُ,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Worthy, or deserving, of a thing: and<br>\
meet, fit, or fitted, for it. So in the phrase أَخُو ثِقَةٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Worthy, or deserving, of trust, or confidence;<br>\
expl. by W (p. 91) as meaning a person in whom<br>\
one trusts, or confides. And so in the prov.,<br>\
لَيْسَ أَخُو الكِظَاظِ مَنْ يَسْأَمُهُ (assumed tropical:)  He who is fit, or<br>\
fitted, for vehement striving for the mastery is<br>\
not he who turns away from it with disgust: see<br>\
art. كظ.] ―<br>\
-b7-  It is also used in the sense of ذُو:<br>\
as in the phrase, هُوَأَخُو الغِنَى [(assumed tropical:)  He is possessed,<br>\
or a possessor, of wealth, or competence, or sufficiency]. (Msb.) [So too in the phrase, أَخُو الخَيْرِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Possessed, or a possessor, of good, or of what is<br>\
good. And in like manner,] أَخُو الخَنَعِ means<br>\
[ذُو الخَنَعِ, i. e. ذُو الذِّلَّةِ, i. e.] الّذَّلِيلُ [(assumed tropical:)  The low,<br>\
base, or abject]. (Ham p. 44.) [So too] سَيْرُنَا<br>\
أَخُو الجِيْدِ means [سَيْرُنَا ذُوالجَيْدِ, i. e.] سَيْرُنَا جَاهِدٌ<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  Our journeying is laborious: see an ex. in the<br>\
first paragraph of art. غدر]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  حُمَّى<br>\
الأَخَوَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  A fever that affects the patient two<br>\
days, and quits him two days; or that attacks on<br>\
Saturday, and quits for three days, and comes<br>\
[again] on Thursday; and so on. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
دَمُ الأَخَوَيْنِ: see دَمٌ, in art. دمى.<br>\
أَخًا:see أَخٌ.<br>\
أَخْوٌ:see أَخٌ.<br>\
أَخُو:see أَخٌ.<br>\
أُخْتٌ: see أَخٌ, in four places.<br>\
[<br>\
أُخَيٌّ and أُخَيَّةٌ dims. of أَخٌ and أُخْتٌ.]<br>\
أَخَوِيٌّ Brotherly; fraternal; of, or relating<br>\
to, a brother, and a friend or companion: and<br>\
also, sisterly; of, or relating to, a sister; because<br>\
you say أَخَوَاتٌ [meaning “sisters”]; but Yoo<br>\
used to say ↓ أُخْتِىُّ, which is not agreeable with<br>\
analogy. (S, TA.)<br>\
أُخْتِىُّ: see أَخَوِىُّ.<br>\
إِخْوَانٌ, besides being a pl. of أَخٌ, q. v., is a<br>\
dial. var. of خِوَانٌ. (TA. [See art. خون.])<br>\
إِخَاوَةٌ: see 3.<br>\
أُخُوَّهٌ an inf. n. of 1: and also [used as] a<br>\
simple subst. (TA.) See 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  When it does<br>\
not relate to birth, it means (assumed tropical:)  Conformity, or<br>\
similarity; and combination, agreement, or unison,<br>\
in action. (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, TA.)<br>\
آخِيَّةٌ, (Lth, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) originally of the<br>\
measure فَاعُولَةٌ, [i. e. آخُويَةٌ,] (Msb,) and آخِيَةٌ,<br>\
(Lth, Msb, K,) and أَخِيَّةٌ, (JK, K, TA, [but in<br>\
the K the orthography of these three words is<br>\
differently expressed in different copies, and somewhat obscurely in all that I have seen,]) A piece<br>\
of rope of which the two ends are buried in the<br>\
ground, (ISk, JK, S,) with a small staff or stick,<br>\
or a small stone, attached thereto, (ISK, S,) a<br>\
portion thereof, resembling a loop, being apparent,<br>\
or exposed, to which the beast is tied; (ISk, JK,<br>\
S;) it is made in soft ground, as being more<br>\
commodious to horses than pegs, or stakes, protruding from the ground, and more firm in soft<br>\
ground than the peg, or stake: (TA:) or a loop<br>\
tied to a peg, or stake, driven [into the ground],<br>\
to which the beast is attached: (Msb:) or a<br>\
stick, or piece of wood, (K, TA,) placed crosswise<br>\
(TA) in a wall, or in a rope of which the two ends<br>\
are buried in the ground, the [other] end [or<br>\
portion] protruding, like a ring, to which the<br>\
beast is tied: (K, TA:) or a peg, or stake, to<br>\
which horses are tied: (Har p. 42:) [see also<br>\
آرِىُّ:] the pl. of the first is أَوَاخِىُّ; (JK, S, Msb,<br>\
K;*) and of the second, أوَاخٍ; (Msb;) and of<br>\
the third, أَخَايَا, (JK, K,*) like as خَطَايَا is pl.<br>\
of خَطِيَّةٌ. (TA.) In a trad., the believer and<br>\
belief are likened to a horse attached to his آخيّة;<br>\
because the horse wheels about, and then returns<br>\
to his آخيّة; and the believer is heedless, and then<br>\
returns to believe. (TA.) And in another, men<br>\
are forbidden to make their backs like the أَخَايَا<br>\
of beasts; i. e., in prayer; meaning that they<br>\
should not arch them therein, so as to make them<br>\
like the loops thus called. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q.<br>\
طُنُبٌ; (K;) i. e. The kind of tent-rope thus<br>\
called. (TA in art. طنب, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
sacred, or an inviolable, right or the like; syn.<br>\
حُرْمَةٌ and ذِمَّةٌ. (S, K.) You say, لِفُلَانٍ أَوَاخِىُّ<br>\
وَأَسْبَابٌ تُرْعَى [(assumed tropical:)  To such a one belong sacred, or<br>\
inviolable, rights, and ties of relationship and love,<br>\
to be regarded]. (S.) And لَهُ عِنْدِى آجِيَّةٌ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
has, with me, or in my estimation, a strong,<br>\
sacred, or inviolable, right; and a near tie or<br>\
connexion, or means of access or intimacy or ingratiation. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  In a trad. of &#39;Omar, in<br>\
which it is related that he said to El-&#39;Abbás,<br>\
أَنْتَ آخِيَّةُ آبَآءِ رَسُولِ اَللّٰهِ, it is used in the sense of<br>\
بَقِيَّةَ; [and the words may therefore be rendered<br>\
Thou art the most excellent of the ancestors of<br>\
the Apostle of God;] as though he meant, thou<br>\
art he upon whom one stays himself, and to<br>\
whom one clings, of the stock of the Apostle of<br>\
God. (TA.)<br>\
