AZ, أَجَلْتُ عَلَيْهِمٌ, inf. n. as above, signifies I committed a crime against them: and AA says that<br>\
جَلَبْتُ عَلَيْهِمْ and جَرَرْتُ and أَجَلْتُ have one and<br>\

10<br>\
إِسْتَاْجَلَ see 2 and 5.<br>\
أَجْلٌ is originally the inf. n. of أَجَلَ شَرًّا “ he<br>\
committed evil; ” and is used to indicate the<br>\
causation of crimes; and afterwards, by extension<br>\
of its application, to indicate any causation: (Bd in<br>\
v. 35:) one says, فَعَلْتُهُ مِنْ أَجْلِكَ, and ↓ من إِجْلِكَ,<br>\
(S, K,) and فَعَلْتُهُ أَجْلَكَ, and ↓ إِجْلَكَ, (so in some<br>\
copies of the K,) and من أَجْلَالِكَ, and من إِجْلَالِكَ,<br>\
(K, [belonging to art. جلو, in which also they are<br>\
mentioned,]) and من أَجْلالِكَ, and من إِجْلَالِكَ,<br>\
(so in some copies of the K and in the TA, [belonging to art. جل,]) i. e. [I did it] مِنْ جَرَّاكَ,<br>\
(S,) which means [originally] in consequence of<br>\
thy committing it: (Bd ubi suprà:) [and then,<br>\
by extension of its application, as shown above,<br>\
because of thee, or of thine act &amp;c.; on thine<br>\
account; for thy sake; as also لِأَجْلِكَ, which is<br>\
more common in the present day:] or منْ جَلَلِكَ:<br>\
(K:) and مِنْ أَجْلِهِ كَانَ كَذَا, i. e. بِسَبَبِهِ [Because<br>\
of him, or it, it was thus, or such a thing was].<br>\
(Msb.) An instance of its occurrence without<br>\
مِنْ [or لِ] is presented by the saying of &#39;Adee<br>\
Ibn-Zeyd,<br>\
أَجْلَ أَنَّ اللّٰهَ قَدْ فَضَّلَكُمْ<br>\
[Because that God hath made you to have excel-lence, or hath preferred you]. (TA.)<br>\
إِجْلٌ, whence فَعَلْتُهُ مِنْ إِجْلِكَ, and فَعَلْتُهُ إِجْلَكَ:<br>\
see أَجْلٌ, in two places.<br>\
أَجَلٌ, (S, Mughnee, K,) with the ل quiescent,<br>\
(Mughnee,) is written with kesr and with fet-h<br>\
[to the medial letter, i. e. ↓ أَجِلْ as well as أَجَلْ]<br>\
like نعم [which is written نَعِمٌ as well as نَعَمْ]:<br>\
(TA:) it is a particle (Mughnee) denoting a<br>\
reply; like نَعَمْ; (S, Mughnee, K;) importing<br>\
acknowledgment of the truth of the speaker, to<br>\
him who gives information; and the making a<br>\
thing known, to him who asks information; and<br>\
a promise, to him who seeks, or demands;<br>\
(Mughnee;) i. e. It is as thou sayest [in the first<br>\
case; and yes, or yea, in the same, and in the<br>\
other cases]; (K voce بَسَلٌ;) therefore it occurs<br>\
after such sayings as “ Zeyd stood ” and “ did<br>\
Zeyd stand? ” and “ beat thou Zeyd: ” but ElMálakee restricts the information to that which is<br>\
affirmative, and the saying expressive of seeking<br>\
or demanding to that which is without prohibition:<br>\
and it is said by some that it does not occur after<br>\
an interrogation: (Mughnee:) Er-Radee says, in<br>\
the Expos. of the Káfiyeh, after Z and others,<br>\
that it is to denote acknowledgment of the truth<br>\
of information, and does not occur after a saying<br>\
in which is the meaning of seeking, or demanding:<br>\
(TA:) or, accord. to Z and Ibn-Málik and others,<br>\
it relates particularly to information: and accord.<br>\
to Ibn-Kharoof, it occurs mostly after information:<br>\
(Mughnee:) in the Expos. of the Tes-heel, it is<br>\
said to be for denoting acknowledgment of the<br>\
truth of information, past or other, affirmative or<br>\
negative, and not to occur after an interrogation:<br>\
(TA:) Akh says that it is better than نَعَمْ (S,<br>\
Mughnee, K *) after information, (Mughnee,) in<br>\
acknowledging the truth of what is said; (S,<br>\
Mughnee, K;) and نعم is better than it after an<br>\
interrogation: (S, Mughnee, K:) so that when<br>\
one says, سَوْفَ تَذْهَبُ [Thou wilt, or shalt, go<br>\
away], thou sayest أَجَلْ [Yes]; and it is better<br>\
than نعم: but when one says, أَتَذْهَبُ [Wilt thou<br>\
go away?], thou sayest نعم; and it is better than<br>\
اجل. (S.)<br>\
أَجَلٌ The term, or period, of a thing: (S, K:)<br>\
its assigned, appointed, or specified, term or<br>\
period: this is the primary signification: (TA:)<br>\
or the term, or period, and time of falling due, of<br>\
a thing: (Msb:) pl. آجَالٌ. (Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
The period of women&#39;s waiting, before they may<br>\
marry again, after divorce: as in the Kur ii. 231<br>\
and 232. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The period, or extremity of time,<br>\
in which falls due a debt (K, TA) and the like.<br>\
(TA.) You say, بَاعَهُ إِيَّاهُ إِلَي أَجَلٍ [He sold it<br>\
to him for payment at an appointed period]: and<br>\
سَلَّمَ الدَّارَاهِمَ فِى طَعَامٍ إِلَي أَجَلٍ [He delivered the<br>\
money for wheat, or the like, to be given at an<br>\
appointed period]. (Msb in art. كلأ.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The<br>\
term, or period, of death; (K;) the time in<br>\
which God has eternally decreed the end of life<br>\
by slaughter or otherwise: or, as some say, the<br>\
whole duration of life: and its end: a man&#39;s life<br>\
being thus termed: and his death, by which it<br>\
terminates: (Kull p. 17:) the assigned, or appointed, duration of the life of a man. (TA.) One<br>\
says, دَنَا أَجَلُهُ, meaning His death drew near;<br>\
originally, اسْتِيفَآءُ الأَجَلِ the completion of the<br>\
duration of life. (TA.) In the Kur vi. 128,<br>\
(see 2, above,) the meaning is, The term of death:<br>\
or, as some say, the term of extreme old age:<br>\
(TA:) or the day of resurrection. (Bd, * Jel.)<br>\
The words of the Kur [vi. 2] ثُمَّ قَضَى أَجَلًا وَ أَجَلٌ<br>\
مَسَمَّى عِنْدَهُ mean [Then He decreed a term,] the<br>\
term of death, and [there is a term named with<br>\
Him,] the term of the resurrection: or the period<br>\
between the creation and death, and the period<br>\
between death and the resurrection; for اجل is<br>\
applied to the end of a space of time and to the<br>\
whole thereof: (Bd:) or the meaning is, the<br>\
period of sleep, and the period of death: (Bd,<br>\
TA:) or the period of those who have passed<br>\
away, and the period of those who remain and<br>\
those who are to come: (Bd:) or the period of<br>\
remaining in this world, and the period of remaining in the world to come: or in both instances<br>\
death is meant; [accidental, and natural;] for<br>\
the اجل of some is by accidental means, as the<br>\
sword, and drowning, and burning, and eating<br>\
what disagrees, and other means of destruction;<br>\
while some have their full periods granted to them<br>\
and are preserved in health until they die a natural<br>\
death: or the اجل of some is that of him who<br>\
dies in a state of happiness and enjoyment; and<br>\
of others, that of him who reaches a limit beyond<br>\
which God has no? appointed, in the natural<br>\
course of this world, any one to remain therein;<br>\
and to both of these, reference is made in the Kur<br>\
[xvi. 72 and] xxii. 5. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Sometimes, also,<br>\
it means Destruction: and thus it has been explained as occurring in the Kur [vii. 184], where<br>\
it is said, وَأَنْ عَسَى أَنْ يَكُونَ قَدِ ا قْتَرَبَ أَجَلُهُمْ<br>\
[And that, may be, their destruction shall have<br>\
drawn near]. (TA.)<br>\
أَجِلْ: see أَجَلٌ.<br>\
أَجِلٌ: see آجِلٌ.<br>\
أَجِيلٌ Having a delay, or postponement, granted<br>\
to him, to a certain time; i. q. إِلَى وَقْتٍ ↓ مُؤَجَّلٌ.<br>\
(Lth.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also آجِلٌ.<br>\
آجِلٌ Delayed; postponed; kept back; syn.<br>\
مُتَأَخِّرٌ; [but in some copies of the K, for آجِلٌ,<br>\
we find ↓ أَجِلٌ;] as also ↓ أَجِيلٌ, of which the pl.<br>\
is أُجْلٌ: (K:) and therefore, (TA,) not present;<br>\
future; to come; contr. of عَاجِلٌ: (S, Msb, TA:)<br>\
and ↓ مُتَأَجِّلٌ, also, signifies delayed, deferred, or<br>\
postponed, to the time of the end of a period;<br>\
originally, contr. of مُتَعَجِّلٌ. (Mgh.) [See also<br>\
أَجِيلٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] الآجِلَةُ The [future,] latter,<br>\
ultimate, or last, dwelling, or abode, or life; the<br>\
world to come; syn. الآخِرَةُ; (K, TA;) contr. of<br>\
العَاجِلَةُ. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Committing a crime; or a<br>\
committer of a crime. (S, TA.)<br>\
مُؤَجَّلٌ Determined, defined, or limited, as to<br>\
time; applied to a writing: so in the Kur iii. 139:<br>\
(Bd, Jel, TA:) and to a debt; contr. of حَالٌّ,<br>\
q. v. (Mgh in art. حل.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also أَجِيلٌ.<br>\
مُتَأَجِّلٌ: see آجِلٌ.<br>\
