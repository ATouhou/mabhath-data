أَجَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
اَجُرَ and<br>\
اَجِرَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) which<br>\
latter form of the aor., though known to most of<br>\
the lexicologists, is disacknowledged by a few of<br>\
them, (TA,) inf. n. أَجْرٌ; (S, Msb;) and ↓ آجرهُ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K,) a form disacknowledged by<br>\
As, but said by some to be the more chaste of the<br>\
two, of the form أَفْعَلَ, not فَاعَلَ, as IKtt by<br>\
evident inadvertence makes it to be by saying that<br>\
its aor. is يُؤَاجِرُ, (TA,) inf. n. إِيجَارٌ; (S;) He<br>\
(God, S, A, Mgh, Msb, and a man, Mgh) recompensed, compensated, or rewarded, him, (S, A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) عَلَي مَا فَعَلَ for what he had done. (A.)<br>\
[See أَجْرٌ, below.] أُجِرَ فُلَانٌ خَمْسَةً مِنْ وَلَدِهِ [Such<br>\
a one became entitled to a reward for five of his<br>\
children, by their death, (for it is believed that the<br>\
Muslim will be rewarded in Paradise for a child<br>\
that has died in infancy)], (S,) and أُجِرَ وَلَدَهُ, (A,)<br>\
and أُجِرَ فِي أَوْلَادِهِ, (K,) mean that his children<br>\
died, and became [causes of] his reward. (S, A,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَجَرَهُ, (K,) aor.<br>\
اَجُرَ, (S,) [He served him<br>\
for hire, pay, or wages;] he became his hired<br>\
man, or hireling. (S, K.) So in the Kur xxviii. 27.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَجَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
اَجُرَ, (L, Msb, K,) and<br>\
اَجِرَ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) inf. n. أَجْرٌ, (L, K,) He let him (namely<br>\
his slave) on hire, or for pay, or wages; (L, *<br>\
Msb, * K;) as also ↓ آجرهُ, inf. n. إِيجَارٌ; (&#39;Eyn,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) and ↓ آجرهُ, inf. n. مؤاجرة: (K:)<br>\
all these are good forms of speech, used by the<br>\
Arabs: (L:) or ↓ آجرهُ having for its inf. n. مؤاجرة<br>\
signifies he appointed him (namely another man)<br>\
hire, pay, or wages, for his work; (Mj, Mgh;) or<br>\
he engaged with him to give him hire, pay, or<br>\
wages; (A, Mgh, Msb;) and can have only one<br>\
objective complement: whereas, ↓ when it is of<br>\
the measure أَفْعَلَ it is doubly trans.; (Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
so that one says, مَمْلُوكَهُ ↓ آجَرَنِي He let me his<br>\
slave on hire. (Mgh.) One also says, أَجَرَ الدَّارَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
اَجُرَ and<br>\
اَجِرَ, inf. n. أَجْرٌ, He let the house on hire;<br>\
and so الدَّارَ ↓ آجر, [inf. n. إِيجَارٌ:] (Msb, TA:)<br>\
and الدَّارَ ↓ آجرهُ, [inf. n. إِيجَارٌ,] He let to him the<br>\
house on hire: (S, A, Mgh, Msb:) the latter verb<br>\
being of the measure أَفْعَلَ, not of the measure<br>\
فَاعَلَ: (A, Mgh, Msb:) and the vulgar say, وَاجَرَ:<br>\
(S:) some, however, say, الدَّارَ ↓ آجَرْتُ, inf. n.<br>\
مُؤَاجَرَةٌ, making the verb of the measure فاعل:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) some also say, الدَّارَ زَيْدَّا ↓ آجَرْتُ [I<br>\
let the house to Zeyd], inverting the order of<br>\
the words: (Msb, TA:) and the lawyers say,<br>\
الدَّارَ مِنْ زَيْدٍ ↓ آجَرْتُ [in the same sense, like as<br>\
بِعْتُ مِنْ زَيْدٍ الدَّارِ means the same as بِعْتُ زَيْداً<br>\
الدَّارَ]. (Msb: [but in the Mgh, the like of this<br>\
is said to be vulgar.])<br>\
3<br>\
آجر, inf. n. مُؤَاجَرَةٌ: see 1, latter half, in<br>\
three places: and see 10. One says also, of a<br>\
woman, (K,) or a whorish female slave, (TA,)<br>\
آجَرَتْ, [of the measure فَاعَلَتْ, not أَفْعَلَتْ, (see مُؤْجِرٌ,<br>\
below,)] meaning She prostituted herself for hire.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
4<br>\
آجَرَتٌ, inf. n. إِيجَارٌ: see 1, first sentence: ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
and see the latter half of the same paragraph, in<br>\
seven places.<br>\
8<br>\
ائتجر [written with the disjunctive alif اِيتَجَرَ]<br>\
He gave alms, seeking thereby to obtain a reward<br>\
[from God]: (L, K *:) and ائتجربِهِ He gave it<br>\
as alms, seeking thereby a reward. (L.) اتَّجَرَ for<br>\
ائتجر is not allowable, because ء cannot be incorporated into ت: [or, accord. to some, this is<br>\
allowable, as in اتَّزَرَ for ائتزر, and اتَّمَنَ for ائتمن,<br>\
&amp;c.:] Hr allows it; and cites an ex. in a trad.;<br>\
but IAth says that the proper reading in this<br>\
instance is يَأْتَجِرُ, not يَتَّجِرُ; or, if the latter be<br>\
allowed, it is from التِّجَارَةُ, not from الأَجْرُ. (L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  اُوتُجِرَ عَلَيْهِ بِكَذَا [in which the radical ء is<br>\
changed into و because the alif preceding it is<br>\
made disjunctive and with damm, (in one copy of<br>\
the S, and in the L and TA, erroneously written<br>\
اِيْتَجَرَ,) He was hired to do it for such a sum or<br>\
thing, (see مُؤْتَجَرٌ, below,)] is from الأُجْرَةُ. (S, L.)<br>\
10<br>\
استأجرهُ, (S, K,) and ↓ آجرهُ, (K,) [the<br>\
latter of the measure فَاعَلَ, as has been clearly shown<br>\
above, from the A and Mgh and Msb,] He hired<br>\
him; took him as a hired man, or hireling. (S,<br>\
K, TA.) You say also, استأجر الدَّارَ [He hired the<br>\
house; took it on hire]. (A, Mgh,)<br>\
أَجْرٌ A recompense, compensation, or reward,<br>\
(S, K, &amp;c.,) for what one has done; (K;) i. q.<br>\
ثَوَابٌ; (S;) as also ↓ إِجَارَةٌ and ↓ أَجَارَةٌ and ↓ أٌجَارَةٌ,<br>\
(K,) of which three forms the first is the most<br>\
generally known and the most chaste, (TA,) and<br>\
↓ أُجْرَةٌ: (TA:) or, as some say, there is a distinction between أَجْرٌ and ثَوَابٌ: El-&#39;Eynee says, in<br>\
the Expos. of El-Bukháree, that what is obtained by<br>\
the fundamental practices of the law, and by obligatory religious services, is termed ثواب; and what<br>\
is obtained by supererogatory acts of religion, اجر;<br>\
for ثواب is properly a substitute for a thing itself;<br>\
and اجر, for the profit arising from a thing; though<br>\
each is sometimes used in the sense of the other:<br>\
(TA:) it is well known that اجر signifies a<br>\
recompense, or reward, from God to a man, for<br>\
righteous conduct; (MF;) and ↓ إِجَارَةٌ, recompense, compensation, hire, pay, or wages, from<br>\
one man to another, for work; (Mgh, MF;) and<br>\
hence الأَجِيرُ; (MF;) and ↓ أُجْرَةٌ also has this<br>\
latter signification, (Mgh, TA,) and is syn. with<br>\
كِرَآءٌ; (S, Mgh, K;) [signifying likewise rent for<br>\
a house, and the like;] but أَجْرٌ is used [sometimes]<br>\
in the sense of إِجَارَةٌ and in that of أُجْرَةٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
the pl. of أَجْرٌ is أُجُورٌ (Msb, K) and آجَارٌ; (K;)<br>\
but the latter form was unknown to MF: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. of ↓ أُجْرَةٌ is أَجَرٌ and أُجُرَاتٌ and أُجَرَاتٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) [One says, أَجْرُكَ عَلَي اللّٰهِ Thy recompense is due from God. And, to console a person<br>\
for the death of a relation or friend, عَظَّمَ اللّٰهُ أَجْرَكَ<br>\
فِيهِ May God largely compensate thee for him!<br>\
i. e., for the loss of him.] By the expression<br>\
أَجْرٍ كِرِيمٍ in the Kur xxxvi. 10 is said to be<br>\
meant Paradise. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  A dowry, or nuptial gift; a gift that is given to, or for, a bride:<br>\
(K:) pl. أُجُورٌ: so in the Kur xxxiii. 49 [&amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  Praise; good fame. (K.) So, as<br>\
some say, in the Kur xxix. 26. (TA.)<br>\
أَجُرٌّ and أُجُرٌ: see آجُرٌّ.<br>\
أُجْرَةٌ: see أَجْرٌ, in three places.<br>\
إِجْرِيَّا and إِجْرِيَّآءُ: see إِجِّيرَى.<br>\
أَجُورٌ: see آجُرٌّ.<br>\
أَجِيرٌ (S, K, &amp;c.) A hired man; a hireling:<br>\
(L:) or of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure مُفَاعَلٌ, i. e. a man with whom one has<br>\
engaged to give him hire, pay, or wages: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb: *) pl. أُجَرَآءُ. (L, Msb.)<br>\
إِجَارَةٌ and أَجَارَةٌ and أُجَارَةٌ: see أَجْرٌ, in four<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  إِجَارَةٌ also signifies The giving of usufructs for a compensation. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Land<br>\
which its owners have let to him who will build<br>\
upon it: so explained by the lawyers. (Mgh.)<br>\
إِجَّارٌ (S, M, IAth, Mgh, K) and ↓ إِجَّارَةٌ (M)<br>\
and ↓ إِنْجَارٌ (Mgh, K) The flat top, or roof, of a<br>\
house, (S, M, IAth, Mgh, K,) that has not around<br>\
it anything to prevent a person&#39;s falling from it:<br>\
(M, * IAth:) of the dial. of the people of Syria<br>\
and of El-Hijáz: (S:) pl. [of the first and second]<br>\
أَجَاجِيرُ and أَجَاجِرَةٌ; (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K;) and [of<br>\
the third] أَنَا جِيرُ. (Mgh, K.)<br>\
إِجَّارَةٌ: see إِجَّارٌ.<br>\
إِجِّيرَى (ISk, K) and ↓ إِجْرِيَّا and ↓ إِجْرِيَّآءُ (S in<br>\
art. هجر) A custom; a habit. (ISk, K, and S<br>\
ubi suprà.) The hemzeh is said to be a substitute<br>\
for ه [in هِجِّيرَى &amp;c.] (TA.) You say, مَا زَالَ<br>\
ذٰلِكَ إِجِّيرَاهُ That ceased not to be his custom, or<br>\
habit. (ISk.)<br>\
آجَرٌ and آجُرٌ and آجِرٌ, and the pls. آجُرُونَ and<br>\
آجِرُونَ: see what next follows.<br>\
آجُرٌّ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ آجُرٌّ (AA, Ks, K)<br>\
and ↓ آجُورٌ (S, K) and ↓ أَجُورٌ and ↓ يَاجُورٌ (K) and<br>\
↓ أَجُرٌ (as in some copies of the K) and ↓ آجَرٌ, (as<br>\
in some copies of the K and in the TA,) or<br>\
↓ أُجُرٌ, (as in other copies of the K,) and ↓ آجِرٌ<br>\
[to which is erroneously added in the CK آجِرَةٌ]<br>\
and [the pls.] ↓ آجُرُونَ and ↓ آجِرُونَ (K) are syn.,<br>\
(S, K,) of Persian origin, (S,) [from آگُورْ or آگُرْ,]<br>\
arabicized, (S, Mgh, K,) signifying Baked bricks;<br>\
(Msb;) baked clay, (Mgh, L,) with which one<br>\
builds: (S, L:) آجُرٌّ and آجُورٌّ and آجُرٌ [&amp;c.] are<br>\
pls., [or rather coll. gen. ns., except the two forms<br>\
ending with و and ن,] and their sings. [or rather<br>\
ns. un.] are with ة, i. e. آجُرَّةٌ &amp;c. (L.)<br>\
آجُورٌ: see آجُرٌّ.<br>\
إِنْجَارٌ: see إِجَّارٌ.<br>\
مُؤْجَرٌ [A slave, or] a house, let on hire; (Akh,<br>\
T, Msb;) as also ↓ مَأْجُورٌ; (L;) and some say,<br>\
↓ مُؤَاجَرٌ. (Akh, Msb.)<br>\
مُؤْجِرٌ One who lets on hire [a slave, or] a house:<br>\
one should not say ↓ مُوَاجِرٌ; for this is wrong<br>\
with respect to the classical language, and abominable with respect to the conventional acceptation<br>\
and common usage; a foul reproach being meant<br>\
thereby [as is shown by the explanation of آجَرَتْ,<br>\
given above: or, accord to some, it is allowable<br>\
when it relates to a house: (see أَجَرَهُ:) it seems<br>\
to be disallowed only when used absolutely].<br>\
(A, Mgh.)<br>\
مَأْجُورٌ: see مُؤْجَرٌ.<br>\
مُؤَاجَرٌ: see مُؤْجَرٌ.<br>\
مُؤَاجِرٌ: see مُؤْجِرٌ.<br>\
مُؤْتَجَرَ [part. n. of اُوتُجِرَ]. Mohammad Ibn-Bishr El-Khárijee, not [as is said in the S] Aboo-Dahbal, says, (L,)<br>\
يَا لَيْتَ أَنِّى بِأَثْوَابِي وَ رَاحِلَتِى<br>\
عَبْدٌ لِأَهْلِكَ هٰذَا الشَّهْرَ مُؤْتَجَرُ<br>\
[O would that I were, with my clothes and my<br>\
riding-camel, a hired slave to thy family, this<br>\
month]: (S, L.) i. e., مَعَ أَثْوَابِي. (S.)<br>\
يَاجُورٌ: see آجُرٌّ.<br>\
