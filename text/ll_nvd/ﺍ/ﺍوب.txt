إيوَابٌ, of the measure فِيعَالٌ, (M, TA,) or,<br>\
accord. to Fr, إِيَّابٌ is incorrect, and the right<br>\
word is إِيَابٌ: (TA:) [and if so, أَيَّبَ is perhaps<br>\
changed from أَوَّبَ, like as أَيْبَةٌ is from أَوْبَةٌ; and<br>\
تَأْيِيبٌ is perhaps its inf. n., changed from تَأْوِيبٌ:]<br>\

would have come to thee; in which the verb may<br>\
be trans. by itself, or the prep. إِلَى may be understood. (M, TA.) ―<br>\

آبَ إِلَى اللّٰهِ He returned unto God from his sin,<br>\
or offence, and repented. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  آبَ بِهِ إِلَيْهِ<br>\
He made him to return to him, or it; as also<br>\
إلَيْهِ ↓ اوّبهُ. (M.) And آبَ يَدَهُ إِلَى سَيْفِهِ, (as in<br>\

him; [i. e., with David;] (S, * M, TA;) but some<br>\
read معه ↓ اُوبِى, meaning return ye with him in<br>\
praising as often as he returneth therein: (M,<br>\

meaning is, 0 mountains, labour ye with him in<br>\
praising God all the day, until the night: (T:)<br>\

[And if thou, or they, (meaning camels,) vie with<br>\
