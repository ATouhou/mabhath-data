آضَ, aor. يَئِيضُ, inf. n. أَيْضٌ, i. q. عَادَ;<br>\
(ISk, S, M, Msb, * K;) as in the phrase آضَ إِلَى<br>\
الشَّىْءِ [He returned to the thing, i. e. to the doing<br>\
of the thing; he did the thing again, or a second<br>\
time]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. رَجَعَ; (S, M, Msb, K;)<br>\
as in the phrase آضَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ [He returned to his<br>\
family]. (S, M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  In the phrase فَعَلْتُ كَذَا<br>\
↓ أَيْضًا, the last word is the inf. n. of آضَ in the<br>\
sense of عَادَ, (ISK, IDrd, S, M, Msb, *) and in the<br>\
sense of رَجَعَ: (IDrd, M:) and the meaning is,<br>\
[I did such a thing again, or a second time;]<br>\
I returned to the doing of such a thing: (IDrd,<br>\
M:) or I did such a thing returning to what<br>\
had preceded. (Msb, K. *) [It also, and more<br>\
commonly, signifies I did such a thing also.]<br>\
When one says, ↓ فَعَلْتُ ذٰلِكَ أَيْضًا [I did that<br>\
again, &amp;c.], you say, ↓ قَدْ أَكْيَرْتَ مِنْ أَيْضٍ [Thou<br>\
hast made much use of the expression أَيْضًا], and<br>\
↓ دَعْنِى مِنْ أَيْضٍ [Let me alone and cease from<br>\
using the expression أَيْضًا]. (ISk, S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  أَيْضٌ<br>\
also signifies (tropical:)  A thing&#39;s becoming another, or a<br>\
different, thing; and being changed from its<br>\
state or condition [to another and a different<br>\
state or condition]: (Lth, K: *) so says Kh.<br>\
(Ham p. 356.) And آضَ كَذَا (tropical:)  He, or it, became<br>\
such a thing. (Lth, S, M, * K.) You say, آضَ<br>\
سَوَادُ شَعَرِهِ بَيَاضًا (A, TA) (tropical:)  The blackness of his<br>\
hair became whiteness. (TA.) And Zuheyr says,<br>\
speaking of a land which he traversed,<br>\
قَطَعْتُ إِذَامَاالآلُ آضَ كَأَنَّهُ<br>\
سُيُوفٌ تُنَحَّى سَاعَةً ثُمَّ تَلْتَقِى<br>\
[I traversed, when the mirage, or the mirage of<br>\
the morning, became as though it were swords<br>\
which were removed a while, then met]. (S.)<br>\
أَيْضٌ and أَيْضًا: see above, in four places.<br>\
