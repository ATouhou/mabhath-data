the later authors have ascribed meanings amounting to twelve: (Mughnee:) a particle which,<br>\
when occurring in an enunciative phrase, [generally] denotes doubt, and vagueness of meaning;<br>\
and when occurring in an imperative or a prohibitive phrase, [generally] denotes the giving of<br>\
option, or choice, and the allowing a thing, or<br>\
making it allowable. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  First, (Mughnee,) it<br>\
denotes doubt. (T, S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K.) So in<br>\
the saying, رَأَيْتُ زَيْدًا أَوْ عَمْرًا [I saw Zeyd or<br>\
&#39;Amr]. (T, * S, Msb.) And جَآنِى رَجُلٌ أَوِ امْرَأَةٌ<br>\
[A man or a woman came to me]. (Mbr, T.)<br>\
And لَبِئْنَا يَوْمًا أَوْ بَعْضَ يَوْمٍ [in the Kur xviii. 18<br>\
and xxiii. 115, We have remained a day or part<br>\
of a day]. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Secondly, (Mughnee,)<br>\
it denotes vagueness of meaning. (S, Msb, Mughnee, K.) S [it may be used] in the first of the<br>\
.exs. given above. (Msb.) And so in the saying,<br>\
وَأَنَّا أَوْ إِيَّاكُمْ لَعَلَى هُدًي أَوْ فِى ضَلَالٍ مُبِينٍ [And<br>\
verily we or ye are following a right direction or<br>\
in manifest error], (S, Mughnee,) in the Kur<br>\
[xxxiv. 23]; (S;) the ex. being in the former او.<br>\
(Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Thirdly, (Mughnee,) it denotes<br>\
the giving of option, or choice. (T, S, M, Mughnee, K.) So in the saying, كُلِ السَّمَكَ أَوِ اشْرَبِ<br>\
اللَّبَنَ [Eat thou the fish, or drink thou the milk];<br>\
i. e. do not thou both of these actions; (Mbr, T,<br>\
S;) but choose which of them thou wilt. (Mbr,<br>\
T.) And تَزَوَّجْ هِنْدًا أَوْ أُخْتَهَا [Take thou as wife<br>\
Hind or her sister]. (Mughnee.) And [in like<br>\
manner] it denotes the making choice. (T.) [So<br>\
when you say, سَأَتَزَوَّجُ هِنْدًا أَوْ أُخْتَهَا, meaning I<br>\
will take as wife Hind or her sister; whichever<br>\
of them I choose.] ―<br>\
-b5-  Fourthly, (Mughnee,) it<br>\
denotes the allowing a thing, or making it allowable. (T, S, Msb, Mughnee, K.) So in the saying,<br>\
جَالِسِ حَسَنَ أَوِ ابْنَ سِيرِينَ [Sit thou with El-<br>\
Hasan or Ibn-Seereen]. (Mbr, T, S.) And<br>\
قُمْ أَوِ اقْعُدْ [Stand thou or sit]: and the person<br>\
to whom this is said may do [one or] both of<br>\
the se actions. (Msb.) [And similar exs. are<br>\
given in the Mughnee.]) But وَلَا تُطِعْ مِنْهُمْ آثِمًا<br>\
أَو كَفُورًا [in the Kur lxxvi. 24, And obey not<br>\
thou, of them, a sinner or a person very ungrateful to God,] means that thou shalt not obey<br>\
either of such persons: (Mbr, T, Mughnee:) in<br>\
which case او is more forcible than وَ; for when<br>\
you say to a person, لَا تُطِعْ زَيْدًا وَعَمْرًا [Obey not<br>\
thou Zeyd and &#39;Amr], he may obey one of them,<br>\
since the command is that he shall not obey the<br>\
two. (Zj, T.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Fifthly, (Mughnee,) it denotes<br>\
unrestricted conjunction. (Mughnee, K.) So in<br>\
the saying, in the Kur [iv. 46 and v. 9], أَوْ جَآءَ<br>\
أَحَدٌ مِنْكُمْ مِنَ الغَائِطِ [And if any one of you<br>\
cometh from the privy]; (TA;) [where, however,<br>\
it may also be rendered or, though] meaning<br>\
وَجَآءَ; (T, TA;) the و in this explanation being<br>\
what is termed a denotative of state. (T.) So,<br>\
too, accord. to AZ, in the expression أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ<br>\
[And they exceeded that number], in the Kur<br>\
[xxxvii. 147]: but see below. (TA.) And so in<br>\
the words, أَوْ أَنْ نَفْعَلَ فِى أَمْوَالِنَا مَا نَشَآءُ [And<br>\
our doing, in respect of our possessions, what we<br>\
will], in the Kur [xi. 89]. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Sixthly,<br>\
it denotes transition, (Mughnee,) used in the<br>\
sense of [the adversative particle] بَلْ, (T, S, M,<br>\
Mughnee, K,) in a case of amplification of speech;<br>\
(S;) accord. to Sb, on two conditions; that it<br>\
shall be preceded by a negation or a prohibition,<br>\
and that the agent shall be mentioned a second<br>\
time; as in مَا قَامَ زَيْدٌ أَوْ مَا قَامَ عَمْرٌو [Zeyd did<br>\
not stand: nay, rather &#39;Amr did not stand]; and<br>\
لَا يَقْمٌ زَيدٌ أَوْ لَا يَقُمْ عَمْرُو [Let not Zeyd stand:<br>\
nay, rather let not &#39;Amr stand]. (Mughnee.)<br>\
Accord. to Fr, (Th, M, Mughnee,) it has this<br>\
meaning in أَوْ يَزِيدُونَ [Nay, rather they exceeded<br>\
that number], (Th, S, M, Mughnee,) in the Kur<br>\
[xxxvii. 147, cited above]: (S:) or the meaning<br>\
is, or they would exceed [that number] in your<br>\
estimation: or these words with those preceding<br>\
them in the same verse mean, we sent him to a<br>\
multitude of whom, if ye saw them, ye would say,<br>\
They are a hundred thousand, or they exceed<br>\
[that number]; (M, Mughnee; *) so that it denotes doubt on the part of men, not of God, for<br>\
He is not subject to doubt: (M:) or we sent him<br>\
to a hundred thousand in the estimation of men,<br>\
or they exceeded [that number] in the estimation<br>\
of men; for God does not doubt: (S:) or او is<br>\
here used to denote vagueness of meaning: (IB,<br>\
Mughnee:) or, it is said, to denote that a person<br>\
might choose between saying, “they are a hundred<br>\
thousand,“ and saying, “they are more;“ but this<br>\
may not be when one of the two things is the<br>\
fact: or, accord. to some of the Koofees, it has<br>\
the meaning of وَ: and each of these meanings,<br>\
except the last, has been assigned to او as occurring in the Kur ii. 69 and xvi. 79. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
Seventhly, it denotes division; (Mughnee, K; *)<br>\
as in the saying, الكَلِمَةُ اسْمٌ أَوْ فِعْلٌ أَوْ حَرْفٌ [The<br>\
word is a noun or a verb or a particle]: so said<br>\
Ibn-Málik: or, as he afterwards said, in preference, it denotes separation (التَّفرِيق) divested<br>\
of the attribute of denoting doubt and vagueness<br>\
of meaning and the giving of option or choice;<br>\
adducing as one of his exs. of this meaning the<br>\
saying, وَقَالُوا كُونُوا هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَى [in the Kur<br>\
ii. 129, And they said, “Be ye Jews” or “Christians”]; because the use of و in division is better;<br>\
as when you say, الكَلِمَةُ اسْمٌ وَفِعْلٌ وَحَرْفٌ: or it<br>\
denotes, accord. to some, distinction (التَّفْصِيل);<br>\
and the meaning of the ex. last cited, say they, is,<br>\
and the Jews said, “Be ye Jews,” and the Christians said, “Be ye Christians.” (Mughnee.) It<br>\
is [said to be] used in this last sense (that of<br>\
التفضيل) in the saying, كُنْتُ آكُلُ اللَّحْمَ أَوِ العَسَلَ<br>\
[I used to eat flesh-meat or honey]; i. e. I used<br>\
to eat flesh-meat one time and honey another time:<br>\
and so in the Kur vii. 3 and x. 13. ―<br>\
-b9-  Eighthly,<br>\
(Mughnee,) it is used in the sense of the exceptive<br>\
إِلَّا, (Mughnee, K,) or إِلَّا أَنْ (M;) and in this<br>\
case the aor. after it is mansoob, because of أَنْ<br>\
suppressed. (Mughnee, K.) So in the saying,<br>\
لَأَقْتُلَنَّهُ أَوْ يُسْلِمَ [I will assuredly slay him or he<br>\
shall become a Muslim; i. e., unless he become a<br>\
Muslim]. (Mughnee. [And a similar ex. is given<br>\
in the M.]) So, too, in the saying,<br>\
وَكُنْتُ إِذَا غَمَزْتُ قَنَاةَ قَوْمٍ<br>\
كَسَرْتُ كُعُوبَهَا أَوْ تَسْتَقِيمَا<br>\
[And I used, when I pinched and pressed the<br>\
spear of a people, to break its knots, or joints, or<br>\
its internodal portions, (the shaft being a cane,)<br>\
or, i. e. unless, it became straight]: (Mughnee,<br>\
K: *) a prov., of which the author is Ziyád ElAajam; meaning, when a people behaved with<br>\
hardness to me, I endeavoured to soften them:<br>\
(TA in art. غمز:) thus related by Sb, the verb<br>\
ending it being rendered mansoob by او; and thus<br>\
he heard it from some one or more of the Arabs;<br>\
but in the original verses, which are but three, it<br>\
is تَسْتَقِيمُ, with refa. (IB and TA in art. غمز.)<br>\
[And similar to these above are the sayings,] إنَّهُ<br>\
لِفُلَانٍ أَوْمَا بِنَجْدٍ قَرظَهُ [Verily it belongs to such<br>\
a one or there is not, i. e. unless there be not, in<br>\
Nejd, a قَرَظَة (see art. قرظ)]: and لَآتِيَنَّكَ أَوْ مَا<br>\
بِنَجْدٍ قَرَظَةٌ [I will assuredly come to thee or there<br>\
is not, i. e. unless there be not, in Nejd, a قَرَظَة];<br>\
meaning I will assuredly come to thee, in truth.<br>\
(T.) ―<br>\
-b10-  Ninthly, (Mughnee,) it is used in the<br>\
sense of إِلَى, (Mughnee, K,) or إِلَى أَنْ; (S;) in<br>\
which case also the aor. after it is mansoob, because of أَنْ suppressed: (Mughnee:) and in the<br>\
sense of حَتَّى [which is also syn. with إِتَى]. (Fr,<br>\
T, M, K.) So in the saying, لَأَضْرِبَنَّهُ أَوْ يَتُوبَ [I<br>\
will assuredly beat him until he repent]. (S.<br>\
[And similar exs. of او as explained by حَتَّي are<br>\
given in the T (from Fr) and in the M and in the<br>\
Mughnee.]) And so in the saying of the poet,<br>\
لَأَسْتَسْهِلَنَّ الصَّعْبَ أَوْ أُدْرِكَ المُنَى<br>\
فَمَا انْقَادَتِ الآمَالُ إِلَّا لِصَابِرِ<br>\
[I will assuredly deem easy what is difficult until<br>\
I attain the objects of wish; for hopes become<br>\
not easy of accomplishment save to one who<br>\
is patient]. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b11-  Tenthly, some say,<br>\
(Mughnee,) it denotes nearness [of one event<br>\
or thing to another]; as in the saying, مَا أَدْرِى<br>\
أَسَلَّمَ أَوْ وَدَّعَ [I know not whether he saluted or<br>\
bade farewell]: (Mughnee, K: [but in the CK<br>\
this ex. is misplaced:]) this, however, is manifestly wrong; او being here used to denote doubt,<br>\
and the denoting of nearness being only inferred<br>\
from the fact of the saluting being confounded<br>\
in the mind with the bidding farewell, since this<br>\
is impossible or improbable when the two times<br>\
are far apart. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b12-  Eleventhly, (Mughnee,) it occurs as a conditional, (T, Mughnee, K,)<br>\
accord. to Ks alone; (T;) or rather as a conjunctive and conditional; وَإِنْ being meant to be<br>\
understood in its place; though in truth the verb<br>\
that precedes it indicates that the conditional<br>\
particle [إِنْ] is meant to be understood [before<br>\
that verb], and او retains its proper character,<br>\
but forms part of that which has a conditional<br>\
meaning because conjoined with a preceding conditional phrase. (Mughnee.) So in the saying,<br>\
لَأَضْرِبَنَّهُ عَاشَ أَوْ مَاتَ, (Mughnee, K,) i. e., إِنْ<br>\
عَاِض بَعْدَ الضَّرْبِ وَ إِنْ مَاتَ [I will assuredly<br>\
beat him if he live (after the beating) or if he<br>\
die]: so says Ibn-Esh-Shejeree. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b13-<br>\
Twelfthly, accord. to Ibn-Esh-Shejeree, on the<br>\
authority of some one or more of the Koofees,<br>\
(Mughnee,) it denotes division into parts, or portions; as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 129, before<br>\
cited,] وَقَالُوا كُونُوا هُودًا أَو نَصَارَى, (Mughnee, K,)<br>\
i. e. And they said, “Be ye, some of you, Jews,<br>\
and, some of you, Christians:” (TA:) but [IHsh<br>\
says,] it appears to me that the meaning here is<br>\
that of التَّفْصِيل mentioned before. (Mughnee.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b14-  [In the K it is said to occur also in the sense<br>\
of أَنْ: but this is evidently a mistake, app. originating in one of the two principal sources of the<br>\
K, namely, the M, in which the same is said, but<br>\
is exemplified by a phrase in which it is explained<br>\
by إِلَّا أَنْ, the eighth of the meanings of أَوْ mentioned above.] ―<br>\
-b15-  See also أَوٌّ below.<br>\
أَوَ in أَوَ لَمْ يَرَوْا &amp;c. is [the conjunction] وَ with<br>\
the interrogative ا prefixed to it. (Fr, T.)<br>\
أَوِّ مِنْ كَذَا (T, M) and أَوَّ (M) [Alas, on<br>\
account of, or for, such a thing!] an expression<br>\
denoting complaint of distress, or of anxiety, or of<br>\
grief or sorrow; (T;) or an expression of grief<br>\
or sorrow; (M;) like ↓ آوِ and ↓ آوٍ and ↓ أَوَتَاه<br>\
(K and TA in art. اوه,) or ↓ أَوَتَاهُ (CK in that art.,)<br>\
or ↓ أَوَّتَاه, or ↓ آوَّتَاه, (S in that art., [the ه in one<br>\
copy of which is marked as quiescent,]) and like<br>\
آهِ and أَوْهِ &amp;c. (S and Msb and K in art. اوه: see<br>\
آهِ in that art.) AZ says, one says, أَوْهِ عَلَى زَيْدٍ<br>\
[meaning Alas, for Zeyd!] with kesr to the ه,<br>\
and عَلَيْكَ ↓ أَوَّتَا [thus without ه, meaning Alas,<br>\
for thee!] with ت; an expression of regret for a<br>\
thing, whether of great or mean account. (T.)<br>\
أَوٌّ The word ↓ أَوْ when made a noun. (T, K.) So<br>\
say the grammarians. (T.) You say, هٰذهِ أَوٌّحَسَنَةٌ<br>\
[This is a good أَوْ]. (T.) And to one who uses<br>\
the phrase أَفْعَلُ كَذَا أَوْ كَذَا, (T,) you say, دَعِ<br>\
الأَوَّجَانِبًا [Let thou, or leave thou, the word أَوْ<br>\
alone]. (T, K.)<br>\
أَوَّةٌ [A moaning (see its syn. آهَةٌ in art. اوه)] is<br>\
said by some to be of the measure فَعْلَةٌ, in which<br>\
the ة is the sign of the fem. gender; for they say,<br>\
سَمِعْتُ أَوَّتَكَ [I heard thy moaning], making it<br>\
ت: and so says Lth; أَوَّةٌ is after the manner of<br>\
فَعْلَةٌ: (T:) you say, أَوَّةً لَكَ [May God cause<br>\
moaning to thee!], (Lth, T, and S in art. اوه,)<br>\
and آهَةً لَكَ: [but accord. to J, the former of these<br>\
is cognate with the latter; for he says that] the<br>\
former is with the ه suppressed, and with teshdeed<br>\
to the و. (S in art. اوه, where see آهَةٌ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَوَّتَا عَلَيكَ;<br>\
and أَوَّتَاه, or آوَّتَاه, or أَوَتَاه, or أَوَتَاهُ: see أَوِّ مِنْ<br>\
كَذَا.<br>\
أُوَّةٌ i. q. دَاهِيَةٌ [A calamity, a misfortune, &amp;c.:<br>\
or, perhaps, very cunning, applied to a man]: pl.<br>\
أُوَوْ; (AA, T, K, TA; [but in copies of the K,<br>\
written أُوَوٌ;]) which is one of the strangest of the<br>\
things transmitted from the Arabs; the regular<br>\
form being أُوَّى, like قُوَّي, pl. of قُوَةٌ; but the word<br>\
occurring as above in the saying of the Arabs,<br>\
مَا هُوَ إِلَّا أُوَّةٌ مِنَ الأُوَوْ [It is no other thing than a<br>\
calamity of the calamities: or, perhaps, he is no<br>\
other than a very cunning man of the very cunning]. (AA, T, TA.)<br>\
آوِ and آوٍ: see أَوِّ: and see آهِ in art. اوه.<br>\
أَوَوِىٌّ and آوِىٌّ: see آيَةٌ, in art. اى.<br>\
آوَّتَاه: see أَوِّ.<br>\
