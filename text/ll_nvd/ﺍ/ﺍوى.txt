أَوَى إِلَيْهِ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) and أَوَاهُ,<br>\
(M, Msb, K,) aor. يَأْوِى, (T, S, Msb,) imperative<br>\
اِيوِ (T,) inf. n. أُوِىُّ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
with damm, (K,) of the measure فُعُولٌ, [originally<br>\
أُوُوىٌ,] (S,) and إِوِىٌّ, (Fr, M, K,) with kesr, (K,)<br>\
and إِوَآءٌ; (S;) and اليه ↓ أوّى, (M, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَأْوِيَةٌ; (K;) and ↓ تأوّى; (M, K;) and ↓ اأْتَوَى,<br>\
(thus [more commonly ائتوى] accord. to a copy<br>\
of the M,) or ↓ اتَّوَى, (K,) like اتَّخَذَ, (TK,) and<br>\
↓ اِيتَوَى, (M, K,) both of the measure افتعل;<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ آوَى is used by some in the same<br>\
sense, but rejected, in this sense, by several;<br>\
(Msb;) the pronoun relating to a place of abode;<br>\
(T, S, M, Msb, K;) He betook himself to it, or<br>\
repaired to it, for lodging, covert, or refuge;<br>\
(Mgh;) and [simply] he got him or got himself,<br>\
betook himself, repaired, or resorted, to it; (T,<br>\
Mgh;) he returned to it; (M;) he took up his<br>\
abode in it; he lodged, or abode, or dwelt, in it.<br>\
(Msb, K.) Hence, in the Kur [xi. 45], سَآوِى إِلَى<br>\
جَبَلٍ يَعْصِمُنِى مِنَ المَآءِ [I will betake myself for<br>\
refuge to a mountain that shall preserve me from<br>\
the water]. (S.) الأُوِىُّ properly relates to living<br>\
beings; but is used otherwise, metaphorically.<br>\
(M.) In the saying of Lebeed,<br>\
بِصَبُوحِ صَافِيَةٍ وَجَذْبِ كَرِينَةٍ<br>\
لَهُ إِبْهَامُهَا ↓ بِمُوَترٍ تَأْتَى<br>\
[With a morning-potation of clear wine (خَمْرٍ<br>\
being understood), and a female singer&#39;s straining<br>\
of her chords, with a stringed instrument to which<br>\
her thumb returns after the straining], he means<br>\
تَأْتَوِى لَهُ, of the measure تَفْتَعِلُ, from أَوَيْتُ إِلَيْهِ<br>\
signifying عُدْتُ; the و being changed into ا<br>\
[written ى], and the ى, which is the final radical,<br>\
being elided. (M. [But see another reading near<br>\
the end of the first paragraph of art. اول.]) أَوَى,<br>\
aor. as above, inf. n. أُوِىٌ, also signifies He turned<br>\
away: and hence, [it is said,] إِذْ أَوَى الفِتْيَةُ إِلَى الكَهْفِ<br>\
[When the young men turned away to the cave:<br>\
though the verb may be here well rendered betook<br>\
themselves for refuge]. (Har p. 246.) You say<br>\
also, أَوَيْتُ إِلَى فُلَانٍ, (A&#39;Obeyd, T,) or لَهُ, (as<br>\
afterwards written in a copy of the T,) [I betook<br>\
myself to such a one, or repaired to him, for<br>\
lodging, covert, or refuge; or] I joined myself,<br>\
got myself, betook myself, repaired, or resorted,<br>\
to such a one: and accord. to AHeyth, أَوَيْتُ<br>\
فُلَانًا signifies the same; but he did not know<br>\
أَوَيْتُ to be syn. with آوَيْتُ as explained below.<br>\
(T.) And أَوَى إِلَى اللّٰهِ He returned unto God.<br>\
(TA, from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَوَى said of a wound: see<br>\
5.<br>\
-A2-  See also 4, in seven places.<br>\
-A3-  أَوَى لَهُ, (T,<br>\
S, M, Mgh, K,) like رَوَى, (K, TA,) but it would<br>\
have been more explicit if the author of the K<br>\
had said like رَمَى, (TA,) [as is shown by the false<br>\
reading in the CK, أوِىَ لَهُ كَرَوِىّ,] aor. يَأوِى,<br>\
(T, S, Mgh,) inf. n. أَوْيَةٌ (S, K) and إِيَّةٌ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
K,) with kesr, (TA,) [originally إِوْيَةٌ,] the و<br>\
being changed into ى because of the kesreh<br>\
before it, (S,) or because combined with ى and<br>\
preceded by sukoon [a mistake for “kesreh”],<br>\
(IB as cited in the TA,) [in a copy of the T<br>\
written ايَّة, and in a copy of the M and in the CK<br>\
اَيَّة,] and مَأْوِيَةٌ, (S, M, K,) without teshdeed, (S,<br>\
TA,) [in my copy of the Mgh written with tesh-deed,] and مَأْوَاهٌ, (S, M, K,) He compassionated<br>\
him; felt compassion, or pity, for him; (T, S,<br>\
M, Mgh, K;) as also ↓ ائتوى, (T, K,) of the<br>\
measure افتعل. (TA.) In using the imperative<br>\
form, you say, اِوِ لَهُ, [unless this be a mistranscription for اِيوِ لَهُ,] meaning Be thou compassionate to him. (T, TA.)<br>\

-A3-  أَوَّيْتُ<br>\
بِالخَيْلِ (ISh, T) [I drew together the horses: this<br>\
meaning seems to be indicated in the T, by the<br>\
context: or] I called out to the horses آوَّهْ, in<br>\
order that they should return at hearing my<br>\
voice: (ISh:) and in like manner one says to<br>\
them ↓ آوِ or آوٍ; (ISh, T, TA;) a well-known<br>\
call of the Arabs to horses; and sometimes آى,<br>\
with a long meddeh, is said to them from afar.<br>\
(T, TA.) [See also 5.]<br>\
4<br>\
آواهُ, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. إيوَآءٌ;<br>\
(T, S, Mgh;) and ↓ أوّاهُ; (K;) and ↓ أَوَاهُ; (T,<br>\
S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) the first of which is the<br>\
[most] approved; (T;) the last used by some;<br>\
(T, Msb;) both given on the authority of AZ,<br>\
(S,) and of A&#39;Obeyd, accord. to whom you say,<br>\
أَوَيْتُ إِلَيْهِ, with the short ا only; (T, M;) He, or<br>\
it, gave him, or afforded him, lodging, covert, or<br>\
refuge; harboured him; sheltered him; protected<br>\
him; (Mgh;) he lodged him, or lodged him with<br>\
himself; made him his guest; or gave him refuge<br>\
or asylum, absolutely, or with himself; syn. أَنْزَلَهُ;<br>\
(K;) or أَنْزَلَهُ. (T, S, TA.) You say also,<br>\
الرَّجُلَ إِلَىَّ ↓ أَوَيْتُ and آوَيْتُهُ [I took the man to<br>\
me to lodge, to be my guest, or to give him refuge<br>\
or asylum]. (M.) And آوَاهُ سَقْفٌ [A roof shel-tered him]. (Mgh.) And الإِبِلَ ↓ أَوَيْتُ and آوَيْتُهَا<br>\
[I lodged the camels in their nightly resting-place];<br>\
both meaning the same. (T.) And it is said in a<br>\
trad., الحَمْدُ لِلّهِ الَّذِى كَفَانَا وَآوَانَا i. e. [Praise be<br>\
to God who hath sufficed us and] hath brought<br>\
us to a place of abode for us, and not made us to<br>\
be scattered like the beasts. (TA.) AHeyth disallowed ↓ أَوَيْتُ as syn. with آوَيْتُ; but it is correct.<br>\
(T.) It is said in a form of divorce, ↓ لَا يَأْوِينِى<br>\
وَإِيَّاكِ بَيْتٌ [A house, or tent, shall not lodge, or<br>\
comprise, me with thee]. (Mgh.) And among<br>\
other instances, is the saying of the Prophet, (T,)<br>\
الضَّالَّةٌ إلَّا ضَالٌّ ↓ لَا يَأْوِى [No one will harbour the<br>\
stray beast but a person straying from the right<br>\
course of conduct]. (T, Mgh.) And his saying,<br>\
الجَرِينُ ↓ لَا قَطْعَ فِى ثَمَرٍ حَتَّى يَأْوِيِه i. e. [There<br>\
shall be no cutting off of the hand in the case of<br>\
stealing fruit] unless the place where the fruit is<br>\
dried contain it [at the time of the stealing thereof].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, إِيوَآءُ خَشَبِ الفَحْمِ The throwing<br>\
of dust, or earth, upon the wood of which charcoal<br>\
is made, and covering it therewith. (Mgh.)<br>\

تَاَوَّىَ see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  تَأَوَّتِ الطَّيْرُ The<br>\
birds collected, or flocked, together; (Lth, T, S,<br>\
M, K;) as also ↓ تَآوَت: (K:) the latter is allowable. (T.) And in like manner one says of other<br>\
things. (M.) [Thus,] one says, تَأَوَّتِ الخَيْلُ The<br>\
horses drew, or gathered, themselves together:<br>\
and تأوّى النَّاسُ The men did so. (T.) You say<br>\
also, of a wound, ↓ تآوى, and ↓ أَوَى, meaning<br>\
It drew together, for healing; and so تآزى, and<br>\
أَزَى: so in the Nawádir el-Aaráb. (T.)<br>\
-A2-  One<br>\
may also say, يَتَأَوَّى, without saying it with ه,<br>\
[i. e. يَتَأَوَّهُ,] meaning He says أَوْهِ. (Fr and T in<br>\

in four places.<br>\
-A2-  See also the last sentence but<br>\
one of the same paragraph.<br>\
10<br>\
اسْتَأْوَيْتُهُ I asked him, or desired him, to<br>\
compassionate me, or have mercy on me; syn.<br>\
اسْتَرْحَمْتُهُ. (T.) A poet (namely, Dhu-r-Rummeh, TA) says,<br>\
وَلَوْ أَنَّنى اسْتَأْوَيْتُهُ مَا أَوَى لِيَا<br>\
[And if I had asked him, or desired him, to compassionate me, he would not have compassionated<br>\
me]. (T, S.)<br>\
أُوَيَّةٌ dim. of آءٌ: see the letter ا.<br>\
آوِ or آوٍ: see 2.<br>\
-A2-  آوٍ [the part. n. of 1] has for<br>\
its pl. أُوِىٌّ [like one of the inf. ns. of 1]. (T, S.)<br>\
The latter is applied to birds, signifying Collecting, or flocking, together; (T, S, M, * K; *) syn.<br>\
↓ مُتَأَوِّيَةٌ (Lth, T) and مُتَأَوِّيَاتٌ. (Lth, T, S, M, K.)<br>\
اِبْنُ آوَى, a determinate noun, (S, M,) [The<br>\
jackal; vulgarly called in the present day وَاوِى;]<br>\
a certain small beast, (M, K,) called in Persian<br>\
شَغَالْ, (S,) or in that language [or in Turkish]<br>\
چَقَالْ: (TA:) it has been said to be the offspring<br>\
of the wolf; but is well known to be not of the<br>\
wolf-kind: (Msb;) آوَى is inseparable from ابن:<br>\
(M:) it is imperfectly decl., (T, S, Msb,) being<br>\
of the measure أَفْعَلُ, (S,) or regarded as such;<br>\
(Lth, T;) or because it has the quality of a proper<br>\
name and the measure of a verb : (Msb :) the<br>\
pl. is بَنَاتُ آوَى, (T, S, Msb, K,) though applying<br>\
to males [as well as females], like بَنَاتُ أَعْوَجَ and<br>\
بَنَاتُ لَبُون. (AHeyth, T.)<br>\
آوِىٌ and أَوَوِىٌّ, said to be rel. ns. of آيَةٌ; which<br>\
see, in, art. اى.<br>\
آيَةٌ, said by some to be originally أَوَيَةٌ:see<br>\
art. ا ى.<br>\
مَأْوًى (S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ مَأْوٍ and ↓ مَأْوَاهٌ (M,<br>\
K [but respecting these two forms see what follows]) nouns of place from the first of the verbs<br>\
in this art.; (M, K;) [A place to which one<br>\
betakes himself, or repairs, for lodging, covert,<br>\
or refuge; a refuge; an asylum; a place of<br>\
resort; (see 1;)] any place to which a thing<br>\
betakes itself, &amp;c., (يَأْوِى إِلَيْهِ,) by night or. by<br>\
day; (S;) the lodging-place, or abode, of any<br>\
animal; the nightly resting-place of sheep or<br>\
goats; (Msb;) and of camels: (Idem in art.<br>\
روح:) ↓ مَأْوٍ is used peculiarly in relation to<br>\
camels: (S;) مَأْوِى الإِبِلِ being a dial. var. of<br>\
مَأْوَى الإِبِلِ, but anomalous, (Fr, T, S, Msb,) and<br>\
the only instance of the kind except مَأْقِى العَيْنِ:<br>\
(Fr, T, M: [but see art. مأق:]) مَأْوَى and مُؤْق<br>\
and مَأْق are the forms preferred: (Fr, T:) [Az<br>\
also says,] I have heard the chaste in speech of<br>\
the Benoo-Kiláb use, for مَأْوَى الإِبِلِ, the word<br>\
↓ مَأْوَاة. (T.) جَنَّةُ المَأْوَى, in the Kur [liii. 15],<br>\
is said to mean The paradise to which repair the<br>\
souls of the martyrs, (M, Bd, Jel, TA,) or the<br>\
pious, (Bd, Jel,) or the angels: (Jel:) or that<br>\
in which the night is passed. (TA.)<br>\
