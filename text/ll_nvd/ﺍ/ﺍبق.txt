أَبَقَ, aor.<br>\
اَبِقَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) which<br>\
is the most common form, (Msb,) and<br>\
اَبُقَ, (S, TS,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) and<br>\
اَبَقَ, (K,) so in the copies of the<br>\
K in the place of<br>\
اَبُقَ; (TA;) and أَبِقَ, aor.<br>\
اَبَقَ;<br>\
(IDrd, Msb, K;) inf. n. إِبَاقٌ (S, Mgh, Msb)<br>\
and أَبْقٌ and أَبَقٌ, (K,) or the first of these is a<br>\
simple subst., and the second and third are the<br>\
inf. ns.; (Msb;) He (a slave) ran away, or fled,<br>\
(T, S, Mgh, Msb,) or went away, (K,) from his<br>\
master, (T, Msb,) without [being induced to do<br>\
so by] fear, or severity of work: (Msb, K:)<br>\
thus the signification is restricted in the &#39;Eyn:<br>\
(Msb:) and in this case, the law ordains that the<br>\
slave shall be restored; but if the act arise from<br>\
severity of work or from fear, he is not to be<br>\
restored: (Lth, TA:) in the Kur xxxvii. 140, it<br>\
is said of Jonas, (T, Bd,) because he fled from his<br>\
people without the permission of his Lord: (Bd:)<br>\
and it is also, tropically, said of a fish: (Mgh:)<br>\
or he (a slave) hid himself, and then went away:<br>\
(M, K:) as also ↓ تأبّق: (M:) or this signifies,<br>\
simply, he hid, or concealed, himself: or he confined, restricted, limited, restrained, or withheld,<br>\
himself: (S, K:) or it has both of the last two<br>\
significations: (Sgh:) and he abstained from a<br>\
thing, as from a sin, or crime. (IAar, K *.)<br>\
A poet says, (S,) namely, &#39;Ámir Ibn—Kaab,<br>\
(AZ,) or &#39;Ámán Ibn-Kaab, or, as some say,<br>\
Ghámán, (AA,)<br>\
↓ أَلَا قَالَتْ بَهَانِ وَ لَمْ تَأَبَّقْ<br>\
كَبِرْتَ وَلَا يَلِيقُ بِكَ النَّعِيمُ<br>\
[Now surely Baháni said, and she did not hide<br>\
herself, or did not restrain herself, Thou hast<br>\
grown old, and enjoyment doth not befit thee]:<br>\
(S:) or she did not hide herself [or her mind],<br>\
but said openly: (TA:) or she did not go far<br>\
[from the person whom she addressed, or from<br>\
the truth]; so says AZ, taking it from إِبَاقٌ as<br>\
relating to a slave: (TA:) or she did not abstain<br>\
from her speech, as from a sin, or crime: (IAar:)<br>\
or she did not disdain, or scorn. (TA.) AHát<br>\
says that he asked As respecting ↓تأبّق, and he<br>\
answered that he knew it not. (TA.)<br>\

تَاَبَّقَ see 1, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2- تَأَبَّقَتْ She (a<br>\
camel) withheld her milk. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  تأبّق الشَّىْءَ<br>\
[or مِنَ الشَّىْءِ] He denied, or disacknowledged, the<br>\
thing. (K.) One says to a man, “Verily in thee<br>\
is such a quality; “ and he replies, مَا أَتَأَبَّقُ I do<br>\
not deny, or disacknowledge: and one says, “O<br>\
son of such a woman; ” and the man replies,<br>\
مَا أَتَأَبَّقُ مِنْهَا I do not deny, or disacknowledge,<br>\
her. (IF.)<br>\
