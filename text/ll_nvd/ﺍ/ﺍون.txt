آنَ, aor. يَؤُونُ, inf. n. أَوْنٌ, He was, or<br>\
became, at rest, or at ease; he rested in a journey.<br>\
(IAar, T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أُنْتُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, I<br>\
enjoyed a life of ease and plenty; a state of<br>\
freedom from trouble or inconvenience, and toil<br>\
or fatigue; a state of ease, repose, or tranquillity. (AZ, T, S, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  I was, or became,<br>\
grave, staid, steady, sedate, or calm. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
I was, or became, gentle; or I acted gently:<br>\
(T, S, M, Msb, K:) and I acted, or proceeded,<br>\
with moderation, without haste or hurry, in pace<br>\
or journeying: (M:) I went gently, softly, or<br>\
in a leisurely manner: (S, K:) أَوْنٌ [the inf. n.]<br>\
is formed by substitution [of أ for ه] from هَوْنٌ.<br>\
(S.) You say, أُنْتُ بِالشَّىْءِ, and عَلَى الشَّىْءِ, I<br>\
was gentle, or I acted gently, with the thing;<br>\
(M;) and فِى الأَمْرِ in the affair. (Msb.) And<br>\
أُنْ عَلَى نَفْسِكَ Act thou gently with thyself, or<br>\
be thou gentle, in pace or journeying: and proceed<br>\
thou with moderation, without haste or hurry:<br>\
(T, S:) said in the latter sense to one who has<br>\
become unsteady, or irresolute. (T.) [In like<br>\
manner,] you say, عَلَى قَدْرِكَ ↓ أَوِّنْ, meaning<br>\
اِتَّئِدْ عَلَى نَحْوِكَ [app. Act thou with moderation,<br>\
gentleness, deliberation, or in a leisurely manner,<br>\
according to thine ability, or to the measure of<br>\
thine ability; for قَدْرٌ and نَحْوٌ are both syn.<br>\
with مِقْدَارٌ]. (T, K.) And فِى سَيْرِكُمْ ↓ أَوِّنُوا<br>\
Proceed ye with moderation in your course or<br>\
pace or journeying. (ISk, T.) And فِى ↓ تَأَوَّنَ<br>\
الأَمْرِ He paused, or was patient, in the affair.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
-A2-  أَوْنٌ also signifies The being weary, or<br>\
fatigued; like أَيْنٌ. (M.) [Whether, in this<br>\
sense, it have a verb, is doubtful: see its syn.<br>\
here mentioned.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The putting oneself to<br>\
trouble, or inconvenience, for the sake of what one<br>\
may expend upon himself and his family. (M.)<br>\
And hence, accord. to one [whose name is imperfectly written in the TA], the word ↓ مَؤُونَةٌ,<br>\
[as being originally مَأْوُنَةٌ,] of the measure مَفْعُلَةٌ:<br>\
but others say that it is of the measure فَعُولَةٌ,<br>\
from مَأَنْتُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  ↓ آنَ أَوْنُكَ and أَوَانُكَ [and<br>\
أَيْنُكَ] signify the same. (M.) [See art. اين.]<br>\
2<br>\
اَوَّنَ see 1, in two places.<br>\
5<br>\
تَاَوَّنَ see 1.<br>\
الآنَ and its vars.: see art. اين. [Accord. to<br>\
some, it belongs to the present art., in which it<br>\
is mentioned in the Msb.]<br>\
أَوْنٌ: see 1 [of which it is the inf. n.]: and<br>\
see also what next follows.<br>\
أَوَانٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ إِوَانٌ, (T, M,<br>\
Msb, K,) the latter mentioned by Ks on the<br>\
authority of Aboo-Jámi&#39;, but the former is the<br>\
usual mode of pronouncing it, (T,) and ↓ أَوْنٌ,<br>\
(M,) A time; a season: pl. آوِنَةٌ; (T, S, M,<br>\
Msb, K;) but Sb says آوناتٌ; (M; [so in a<br>\
copy of that work; app. آوِنَاتٌ, as though pl.<br>\
of آوِنَةٌ;]) and آيِنَةٌ is syn. with آوِنَةٌ. (AA, T,<br>\
K.) You say, جَآءَ أَوَانُ البَرْدِ [The time, or season,<br>\
of cold came]. (T.) And فُلَانٌ يَصْنَعُ ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرَ<br>\
آوِنَةً, (S, K, *) and آيِنَةً, (K, [in the CK آئِنَةً,])<br>\
Such a one does that thing sometimes, leaving<br>\
it undone sometimes. (S, K. *) And أَتَيْتُهُ آينَةً<br>\
بَعْدَ آيِنَةٍ I came to him times after times. (AA,<br>\
T.) And آوِنَةً signifies Time after time. (TA,<br>\
from a trad.) In the saying (of Aboo-Zubeyd, L),<br>\
طَلَبُوا صُلْحَنَا وَلَاتَ أَوَانٍ<br>\
(M,) or إِوَانٍ, (L,) [They sought our reconciliation with them, but it was not the time that<br>\
reconciliation should be sought], accord. to Abu-l-<br>\
&#39;Abbás, the tenween of the last word is not a sign<br>\
of the genitive case, but is, as in the instance<br>\
of إِذٍ, because of the suppression of a proposition<br>\
to which the word should be prefixed, as when<br>\
you say, جِئْتُ أَوَانَ قَامَ زَيْدٌ I came at the time<br>\
that Zeyd stood. (M, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, أَوَانَئِذٍ At<br>\
that time or season; then; like حِينَئِذٍ.]<br>\
إِوَانٌ: see أَوَانٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and see also إِيَوَانٌ.<br>\
آئِنٌ [part. n. of 1:] A man enjoying a life of<br>\
ease and plenty; a state of freedom from trouble<br>\
or inconvenience, and toil or fatigue; a state<br>\
of ease, repose, or tranquillity. (AZ, T, S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence the saying,] رِبْعٌ آئِن خَيْرٌ مِنْ غِبٍّ<br>\
حَصْحَاصٍ [An easy, or a gentle, journey in which<br>\
the camels are watered only on the first and<br>\
fourth days is better than a laborious, or quick,<br>\
journey in which they are watered only on the<br>\
first and third days]. (TA.) [The fem. is آئِنَةٌ:<br>\
the pl. of which is أَوَائِنُ and آئِنَاتٌ.] You say,<br>\
بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَ مَكًّةَ ثَلَاثُ لَيَالٍ أَوَائِنُ Between us and<br>\
Mekkeh are three nights of easy, or gentle, journeying: (S, K: *) and عَشْرُلَيَال آئِنَاتٌ ten nights<br>\
of easy journeying. (S, M, K.)<br>\
إِيوَانٌ and ↓ إِوَانٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) [each] a<br>\
foreign word, [i. e. Persian,] (M,) A chamber,<br>\
or an apartment, (T, Msb,) or a large صُفَّة [i. e.<br>\
porch, or roofed vestibule, or the like], (S, K,)<br>\
similar to an أَزَج [or oblong arched or vaulted<br>\
structure, or a portico], (T, S, M, K,) or built in<br>\
the form of an أَزَج, (Msb,) not closed in the<br>\
front, or face: (T, M, Msb: *) [and a palace;<br>\
often used in this sense in Arabic as well as in<br>\
Persian: and in the present day, the former, and<br>\
more commonly لِيوَان, which is Persian, is also<br>\
applied to an estrade; a slightly-raised portion<br>\
of the floor, generally extending nearly from the<br>\
door to the end, or to each end, of a room:] pl.<br>\
of the former, أَوَاوِينُ, (T, S, K,) because the sing.<br>\
is originally إِوْوَانٌ, (S,) and إِيوَانَاتٌ; and pl. of<br>\
the latter, أُونٌ. (T, S, K.) Hence, إِيوَانُ كِسْرَى<br>\
[The great porch, or the palace, of Kisrà, or<br>\
Chosroes, who is called صَاحِبُ الإِيوَانِ]. (T, S,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also the latter, [and app., accord. to<br>\
the Msb, the former also,] Any prop, or support,<br>\
of a thing: (T, Msb:) particularly, a pole of a<br>\
[tent of the kind called] خِبَآء. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The إِيوَان<br>\
of the لِجَام [is The headstall of the bridle; and]<br>\
has for its pl. إِيوَانَاتٌ. (T, K.)<br>\
