أَمَلَهُ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
اَمُلَ, (T, S, M, Msb,)<br>\
and<br>\
اَمِلَ, (so in the M accord. to the TT,) inf. n.<br>\
أَمَلٌ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) this being the inf. n. accord.<br>\
to IJ, [as distinguished from أَمْلٌ and إِمْلٌ,]<br>\
(M,) He hoped it; or hoped for it; syn. رَجَاهُ;<br>\
(S, * M, * [see أَمَلٌ below,] K;) meaning, what<br>\
was good for him; (S;) as also ↓ أمَلهُ, (T, * M,<br>\
K,) inf. n. تَأميلٌ: (S, T:) or he expected it;<br>\
[or had a distant, or remote, expectation of it;<br>\
for] it is mostly used in relation to that of which<br>\
the occurrence, or coming to pass, is deemed<br>\
remote; as in the saying of Zuheyr,<br>\
أَرْجُو وَآمُلُ أَنْ تَدْنُو مَوَدَّتُهَا<br>\
[I hope, and have a distant expectation, that her<br>\
love may approach]: he who has determined<br>\
upon a journey to a distant town or country says,<br>\
أَمَلْتُ الوُصُولَ [I have formed an expectation, or<br>\
a distant expectation, of arriving]; but he does<br>\
not say, طَمِعْتُ until he has become near thereto;<br>\
for طَمَعٌ relates only to that of which the occurrence, or coming to pass, is [deemed] near: and<br>\
الرَّجَآءُ is between الأَمَلُ and الطَّمَعُ; for it is sometimes attended with fear that the thing expected<br>\
may not come to pass, wherefore it is used in<br>\
the sense of fear; and when the fear is strong,<br>\
[lest the thing expected should not come to pass,<br>\
it denotes distant expectation, and thus] it is used<br>\
in the sense of الأَمَلُ; whence the usage in the<br>\
verse of Zuheyr; but otherwise it is used in the<br>\
sense of الطَّمَعُ: (Msb:) or الرجاء signifies the<br>\
expectation of benefit, or advantage, from some<br>\
preceding cause or means: so says El-Harállee:<br>\
or it is properly syn. with الأَمَلُ; and in common<br>\
conventional language, means the clinging of the<br>\
heart to the coming to pass of a future desired event:<br>\
so says Ibn-El-Kemál: or, accord. to Er-Rághib,<br>\
an opinion requiring the coming to pass of an<br>\
event in which will be a cause of happiness:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ أمّلهُ, inf. n. تَأْمِيلٌ, signifies he expected it much; and is more commonly used<br>\
than the form without teshdeed. (Msb.)<br>\
2<br>\
اَمَّلَ see 1, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  تَأْمِيلٌ also signifies<br>\
The inducing [one] to hope or expect. (KL.)<br>\

تأملالشَّىءِ [He considered the thing, or<br>\
studied it, or contemplated it, carefully, or attentively, with investigation;] he looked at the<br>\
thing endeavouring to obtain a clear knowledge<br>\
of it: (S:) or i. q. تَدَبَّرَهُ; (Msb, TA;) i. e.,<br>\
(Msb,) he looked into the thing, considered it,<br>\
examined it, or studied it, repeatedly, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
in order to know it, or until he knew it, (Msb,)<br>\
or in order to ascertain its real case: (TA:) or<br>\
he looked intently, or hardly, at, or towards, the<br>\
thing: (TA:) or تأمّل signifies he acted, or proceeded, deliberately, not hastily, syn. تَثَبَّتَ, (T,<br>\
M,) or he paused, or waited, syn. تَلَبِّثَ, (K,)<br>\
in an affair, and in consideration; (M, K, TA;)<br>\
he paused, and acted with deliberation. (TA.)<br>\
فِيهِ تَأَمُّلٌ [meaning It requires careful, or attentive, consideration, or simply it requires consideration,] is a phrase [of frequent occurrence<br>\
in the larger lexicons &amp;c., used to imply doubt,<br>\
and also to insinuate politely that the words to<br>\
which it relates are false, or wrong,] like فِيهِ نَظَرٌ<br>\
[q. v.]. (MF in art. صفح.)<br>\

إِمْلٌ: see أَمَلٌ.<br>\
أَمَلٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ إٍِمْلٌ (IJ, M, K)<br>\
and ↓ أَمْلٌ, (K,) the first of which is an inf. n.,<br>\
accord. to IJ, (M,) and is the form commonly<br>\
known, (TA,) Hope; syn. رَجَآءٌ: (S, M, K:) or<br>\
expectation; [or distant, or remote, expectation;<br>\
being] mostly used in relation to that of which<br>\
the occurrence, or coming to pass, is deemed<br>\
remote: applied also to an affection of the heart<br>\
from some good to be attained: (Msb, TA: [in<br>\
both of which are further explanations, for which<br>\
see 1:]) ↓ إِمْلَةٌ, also, signifies the same as أَمَلٌ,<br>\
(S, M, K,) or تَإْمِيلٌ; (Lh, M, K;) [or a manner<br>\
of hoping or expecting; for J adds,] and it is<br>\
like جِلْسَةٌ and رِكْبَةٌ: (S:) and ↓ مُؤَمَّلٌ, likewise, signifies the same as إَمَلٌ: (TA:) the pl.<br>\
of أمَلٌ and إَمْلٌ and أَمْلٌ is آمَلٌ. (M, * K, TA.)<br>\
You say, خَابَ سَعْيُهُ وَأَمَلُهُ [His labour, and his<br>\
hope, or expectation, were disappointed, frustrated, or balked]. (A and TA in art. خيب.) And<br>\
↓ مَا أَطْوَلَ إَمْلَتَهُ How far-reaching is his hope,<br>\
or expectation! (T, * S, M, K:) [or his manner<br>\
of hoping or expecting!] from الأَمَلُ. (T.) ―<br>\
