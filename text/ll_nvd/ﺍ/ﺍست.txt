load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'استاِسْتٌ, signifying The podex, or the anus, (K,)<br>\
or signifying the former, and sometimes used as<br>\
meaning the latter, (S in art. سته,) is with a conjunctive hemzeh, [written اسْتٌ, when not immediately preceded by a quiescence,] and its final<br>\
radical letter is clided; for the original form is سَتَهٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) and it is mentioned in art. سته. (K.)<br>\
[It is of the fem. gender.] It is said in a prov.,<br>\
applied to him who fails of attaining the object<br>\
that he seeks, أَخْطَأَتِ اسْتُهُ الحُفْرَةَ [His anus<br>\
missed the hole in the ground]. (Meyd.) —<br>\
[Hence,] اِسْتُ الدَّهْرِ (tropical:)  The first, or beginning, of<br>\
time; (A;) old, or ancient, time. (IB, A, * K. *)<br>\
One says, مَا زَالَ عَلَى اسْتِ الدَّهْرِ مَجْنُونًا (tropical:)  [He<br>\
ceased not, or has not ceased, from the beginning<br>\
of time, or from old time, to be insane, or mad;<br>\
or] he always was, or always has been, known as<br>\
being insane, or mad: like as one says, عَلَى إِسِّ<br>\
الدَّهْرِ. (AZ, S.) And Aboo-Nukheyleh says,<br>\
مَا زَالَ مُذْ كَانَ عَلَى ا سْتِ الدَّهْرِ<br>\
ذَا حُمُقٍ يَنْمِى وَعَقْلٍ يَحْرشى<br>\
(tropical:)  [He ceased not, or has not ceased, to be, since<br>\
he was in the beginning of time, or in old time,<br>\
i. e., from the first of his existence, a person of<br>\
increasing foolishness, and of decreasing intellect].<br>\
(AZ, S.) IB says, J has erred in mentioning<br>\
است in this section [of the S]; its proper place<br>\
being in art. سته, where he has also mentioned<br>\
it; for its hemzeh is conjunctive, by common<br>\
consent; and if conjunctive, it is augmentative:<br>\
also, his saying that they have changed the [final]<br>\
س in إِسٌّ into ت, like as they have changed the<br>\
[final] س of طَسٌّ into ت, making this word طَسْتٌ,<br>\
is a mistake; for, were it so, the hemzeh of است<br>\
would be disjunctive [in every case; whereas it is<br>\
always conjunctive except after a pause, when<br>\
it is pronounced with kesr]: moreover, he has<br>\
attributed this assertion to AZ, who never made<br>\
it, but only mentioned است الدهر with اسّ الدهر<br>\
because of their agreement in meaning. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence also,] اِسْتُ الكَلْبَةِ (assumed tropical:)  Calamity, or misfortune: (K:) adversity; difficulty; distress;<br>\
affliction: (TA:) what is hated, disliked, disapproved, foul, abominable, or evil. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
اِسْتُ المَتْنِ (assumed tropical:)  The desert: (K:) or the wide desert.<br>\

أُسْتِىٌّ The warp of cloth; (K;) as also أُسْدِىٌّ<br>\
and أُزْدِىٌّ: (TA:) but it is improperly mentioned<br>\
in this art.; for it is [originally أُسْتُوىٌ,] of the<br>\
measure أُفْعُولٌ. (K.)<br>\
اِسْتِىٌّ Of, or relating to, the اِسْت. (TA in art.<br>\
