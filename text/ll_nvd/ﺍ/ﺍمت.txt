أَمَتَهُ, (T, S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
اَمِتَ, (T, M, K,) inf. N.<br>\
أَمْتٌ, (T, S, M,) He measured it; determined its<br>\
measure, quantity, or the like; computed, or conjectured, its measure, quantity, &amp;c.; (T, S, * M,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ امّتهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَأْمِيتٌ. (TA.)<br>\
You say, اِيمِتْ يَا فُلَانُ هٰذَا لِى كَمْ هُوَ Compute<br>\
thou, O such a one, this, for me, how many it is.<br>\
(T.) And أَمَتَ القَوْمَ He computer, or conjectured,<br>\
the number of the people, or company of men.<br>\
(T.) And أَمَتَ المَآءَ He measured, or computed,<br>\
the distance between him and the water. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, (S, K,) aor. as above, (K,) and so the<br>\
inf. n., (S,) i. q. قَصَدَهُ [He tended, repaired,<br>\
betook himself, or directed his course, to it, or<br>\
towards it; aimed at it; sought after it; or<br>\
intended, or purposed, it]; (S, K;) namely, a<br>\
thing. (S.)<br>\
2<br>\
أمّتهُ: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  أُمِّتَ بِلشَّرِّ He was suspected<br>\
of evil. (M, TA.)<br>\
أَمْتٌA measure of distance [&amp;c.]; as in the<br>\
saying, كَمْ أَمْتُ بَيْنَكَ مَا بَيْنَ الكُوفَةِ What is<br>\
the measure of the distance between thee and<br>\
El-Koofeh? (T, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Doubt: (Th, T, M:)<br>\
said to be so termed because this word signifies<br>\
the “ computing, or conjecturing, measure, quantity, and the like,” in which there is doubt. (T,<br>\
TA.) [See 1.] So in the following ex.: الخَمْرُ<br>\
حَرُمَتْ لَا أَمْتَ فِيهَا Wine is unlawful: there is no<br>\
doubt respecting the unlawfulness of it: (Sh, Th,<br>\
T, K:) or the meaning is, there is no indulgence, or<br>\
lenity, with respect to it; from أَمْتٌ as signifying<br>\
“feebleness, or weakness,” in a journey, or pace.<br>\
(T, TA.) And in the saying, لَيْسَ فى الخَمْرِ أَمْتٌ<br>\
There is no doubt respecting wine, that it is<br>\
unlawful. (Th, M.) [Or in the like of these<br>\
two instances it signifies] Disagreement, or diversity of opinion, (اِخْتِلَافٌ,) respecting a thing<br>\
(فِى شَىْءٍ). (M, K.)<br>\
-A3-  Curvity, crookedness,<br>\
distortion, or unevenness: (M, K:) ruggedness<br>\
in one place and smoothness in another; (K;)<br>\
[inequality of surface;] one part being higher,<br>\
or more prominent, than another: (TA:) an<br>\
elevated place: (T, S, K:) small mounds: (Fr,<br>\
Th, T, S, M, K:) or what is elevated, of ground:<br>\
or, as some say, water-courses of valleys, such<br>\
as are low, or depressed: (Fr, T, TA:) small<br>\
hills; hillocks: (M, TA:) a hollow, or depressed<br>\
place, between any two elevated portions of ground<br>\
&amp;c.: (IAar, T, M:) depression and elevation,<br>\
or lowness and highness, (S, M, A, K,) in the<br>\
ground; (A;) used in this sense in the Kur<br>\
xx. 106; (S;) and the same in a water-skin not<br>\
completely filled: (S, A: *) or laxity in a water-skin when it is not well filled so as to overflow:<br>\
(T, * TA:) or a [consequence of] pouring [water]<br>\
into a skin until it doubles, or creases, and not<br>\
filling it; so that one part of it is higher, or<br>\
more prominent, than another: (M, TA:) pl.<br>\
إِمَاتٌ (M, K, TA, but in some copies of the K<br>\
آمَاتٌ, and in the CK اَماتٌ,) and أُمُوتٌ. (M, K.)<br>\
You say, اسْتَوَتِ الأَرْضُ فَمَا بَهَا أَمْتٌ The earth,<br>\
or ground, was even, so that there was not in<br>\
it any depression and elevation. (A, TA.) And<br>\
اِمْتَلَأَ السِّقَآءُ فَمَا بِهِ أَمْتٌ The skin became full,<br>\
so that there was not in it any depression  [of one<br>\
part of its surface] and elevation [of another<br>\
part]. (S, A. *) Az says, (TA,) I have heard<br>\
the Arabs say, قَدْ مَلَأَ القِرْبَةَ مَلْأً لَا أَمْتَ فِيهِ He<br>\
had filled the water-skin so full that there was no<br>\
laxity in it. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A fault, a defect, an<br>\
imperfection, a blemish, or the like, (T, M, K,)<br>\
in the mouth, and in a garment, or piece of cloth,<br>\
and in a stone. (M, K.) [Hence the saying,]<br>\
أَمْتٌ فِى الحَجَرِ لَا فِيكَ i. e. [May there be a<br>\
defect, or the like,] in stones; not in thee: meaning, may God preserve thee when the stones shall<br>\
have perished: (Sb, M:) امت is here put in the<br>\
nom. case, though the phrase is significant of<br>\
a prayer, because it is not a verbal word: the<br>\
phrase is like التُّرابُ لَهْ: and the commencing<br>\
the sentence with an indeterminate noun is approvable because it is virtually a prayer. (M.)<br>\
This prov. is mentioned by the expositors of the<br>\
Tes-heel: not by Meyd. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Weakness;<br>\
feebleness; (T, K;) langour; remissness. (TA.)<br>\
You say, سِرْنَا سَيْرًا لَا أَمْتَ فِيهِ We performed a<br>\
journey, or went a pace, in which was no weakness, or feebleness [&amp;c.]. (T, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  A good<br>\
way, course, mode, or manner, of acting, or<br>\
conduct, or the like. (T, K.)<br>\
مُؤَمَّتٌ Suspected of evil and the like. (K.)<br>\
[See 2.]<br>\
-A2-  [A water-skin] filled [so as to be<br>\
equally distended: see أَمْتٌ]. (K.)<br>\
مَآْءٌ مَأْمُوتٌ A water of which the distance is<br>\
computed, or conjectured. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  هُوَ إِلَى أَجَلٍ<br>\
مَاْمُوتٍ It is until a determined, defined, or<br>\
definite, period. (S, K. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  شَىْءٌ مَأْمُوتٌ A thing<br>\
that is known. (M, TA.) [And so مَوْمُوتٌ.]<br>\
