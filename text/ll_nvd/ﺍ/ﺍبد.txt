abode, or dwelt, (T, S, M, K,) constantly, continually, or permanently, without quitting, (T,<br>\

having for its aor.<br>\
اَبُدَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَبَدَ, (S, M, A, &amp;c.,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
اَبِدَ and<br>\
اَبُدَ, (T, S, M, L, Msb, K,) inf. n. أُبُودٌ;<br>\
(M, L, Msb;) and ↓ تأبّد; (T, M, A, Mgh, L;)<br>\
He (a beast) became wild, or sky; syn. تَوَحَّشَ:<br>\
(S, M, A, Mgh, L, Msb, K:) [because wild<br>\
animals live long, unless killed by accident; accord. to what is said by As and others in explanation of أوَابِدٌ (sing. آبِدَةٌ) applied to animals, as<br>\
meaning wild:] took fright, and fled, or ran away<br>\
at random: (Mgh:) took fright at, and shunned,<br>\
mankind. (T, Msb.) أُبُودٌ also signifies The<br>\
shrinking from a thing, or shunning it; syn. نُفُورٌ.<br>\
(Kull pp. 30 and 31.) And أَبِدَ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\

(K;) and ↓ تأبّد; (A, K;) He (a man, S, A,)<br>\
became unsocial, unsociable, unfamiliar, or sky;<br>\
like a wild animal; syn. توحّش. (S, A, K.) ―<br>\

اَبِدَ, inf. n. أُبُودٌ, (TA,) (tropical:) He<br>\
(a poet) made use, in his verses, of words, or<br>\
phrases, strange, unusual, unfamiliar, or far from<br>\
being intelligible, (K, * TA,) such as were not<br>\
understood (K) at first sight, or on first consideration. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And perhaps from أَبِدَ in<br>\
the sense explained above, but more probably, I<br>\
think, by the substitution of أ for و,] أَبِدَ, aor,<br>\
اَبَدَ,<br>\
(T, S, &amp;c.,) inf. n. أَبَدٌ, (L,) He (a man, S) was<br>\
angry; (T, S, M, L, K;) as also أَمِدَ and وَبِدَ and<br>\

angry with him. (L.)<br>\
2<br>\
أبّد, inf. n. تَأْبِيدٌ, He made, or rendered,<br>\
perpetual. (S, K.) [See also the pass. part. n.<br>\
below.] لَمْ أَفْعَلْ تَأْبِيدًا is a phrase used as though<br>\
meaning ↓ لَمْ آتِ بِآبِدَةٍ [I did not a deed ever to<br>\
be remembered, or mentioned]. (Ham p. 191.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\

5<br>\
تأبّد: see 1, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  He (a man)<br>\
was long distant from his home; expl. by طَالَتْ<br>\
غُرْبَتُهُ; (K;) or was long in a state of celibacy;<br>\
طالت عُزْبَتُهُ, as in one copy of the K; (TA;) and<br>\
became little in need, or little desirous, of women.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It (a place of abode or sojourning) became deserted [by mankind]: (T, M, K:) and<br>\
became inhabited by wild animals. (T, M, A.)<br>\
إِبْدٌ: see إِبِدٌ<br>\
أَبَدٌ Time, syn. دَهْرٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) in an<br>\
absolute sense: (TA:) or a long time, syn. دَهْرٌ<br>\
طَوِيلٌ: (A, and Mgh: [and this may be meant<br>\
in the S &amp;c. by the syn. دَهْرٌ alone, q. v.:]) or,<br>\
properly, a long time (دهر طويل) that is unlimited:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) or an extended space of time that<br>\
is indivisible; for you say زَمَانُ كَذَا: “ the time<br>\
of such a thing,” but not أَبَدُ كَذَا: (Er-Rághib:)<br>\
[and generally, time, or duration, or continuance,<br>\
or existence, without end; endless time, &amp;c.; prospective eternity; opposed to أَزَلٌ, which signifies<br>\
“ time, or duration, &amp;c., without beginning: ” (see<br>\
the latter word for further explanations, &amp;c.:) each<br>\
of these significations may be meant by the explanation in the S and M and K, which is also<br>\
given in the Msb: each correctly applies in particular instances:] pl. [of pauc.] آبَادٌ (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K) and [of mult.] أُبُودٌ (S, M, K) [and أَبَدُونَ, of<br>\
which an ex. will be found below]: but the use<br>\
of these pls. is restricted to particular cases, to<br>\
signify portions of time, or to serve as corroboratives to the sing.: (MF:) as signifying an extended indivisible space of time, [or the like,]<br>\
أَبَدٌ should have neither dual nor pl.; but آبَادٌ is<br>\
sometimes said, when the sing. is restricted to<br>\
denote a particular part, or portion, of the whole<br>\
of that to which it applies, in like manner as a<br>\
generic noun is restricted to a special and partial<br>\
signification: some, however, have mentioned<br>\
آبَادٌ as being post-classical; not of the language<br>\
of the Arabs called العَرَبُ العَرْبَآءُ. (Er-Rághib.)<br>\
طَالَ الأَبَدْ عَلَى لُبَدْ [The time became long to<br>\
Lubad, the last, and the longest of life, of Luk-<br>\
mán&#39;s seven vultures, to the term of the life of<br>\
which his own term of life was decreed to extend,]<br>\
is a proverb applied to any thing that has been of<br>\
long duration. (M.) And you say, رَزَقَكَ اللّٰهُ عُمُرًا<br>\
طَوِيلَ الآبَادِ بَعِيدَ الآمَادِ [May God grant thee a<br>\
life long in duration (lit. durations, the pl. form<br>\
being used not in its proper sense, but to give<br>\
intensiveness of signification), and remote in limit<br>\
(lit. limits)]. (A.) And كَانَ هٰذَا فِى آبَادِ الدَّهْرِ<br>\
This was a long time ago. (Mgh.) And ↓ أَبَدٌ آبِدٌ<br>\
(TA) and ↓ أَبَدٌ أَبِيدٌ, (S, M, TA,) meaning دَائِمٌ<br>\
[in an intensive sense]; (TA;) [A long, or an<br>\
endless, period of time;] like as you say, دَهْرٌ دَاهِرٌ<br>\
(S) or دَهْرٌ دَهِيرٌ. (M.) [In each of these phrases,<br>\
the latter word is added as a corroborative, or to<br>\
give intensiveness to the signification.] لِلْأَبِدَ and<br>\
لِأَبِدٍ and [in an intensive sense, as will be seen<br>\
below,] لِأَبِدَ أَبَدٍ and لِأَبَدِ الأَبَدِ, accord. to different<br>\
recitals of a trad., signify To the end of time; for<br>\
ever; and for ever and ever. (TA.) أَبَدًا is an adv. n.,<br>\
of which the signification includes all future time;<br>\
[meaning Ever; like قَطُّ in relation to past time;]<br>\
(El-Khafájee, El-Bedr Ed-Demámeenee, MF;)<br>\
and عَلَى الأَبَدِ signifies the same. (TA.) [So, too,<br>\
does الأَبَدَ, unless used in a limited sense known<br>\
to the hearer.] When you say, لَا أُكَلِّمُهُ أَبَدًا,<br>\
you mean, [I will not speak to him as long as I<br>\
live, or henceforth, or ever; or I will never speak<br>\
to him; i. e.,] from the time of your speaking to<br>\
the end of your life. (Msb.) [In this case, أَبَدًا<br>\
may also be considered as a mere corroborative. It<br>\
is used in both these ways (للتَّأْسِيسِ and لِلتَّوْكِيدِ)<br>\
in affirmative as well as negative sentences. For<br>\
exs. of its use in affirmative sentences, see the<br>\
Kur xviii. 2 and iv. 60, &amp;c.] One also says,<br>\
لَا أَفْعَلُهُ, (S, M, A,) and لَا آتِيهِ, (T, K,) أَبَدَ الآبَادِ,<br>\
(T, M, A, K,) which, though of classical authority, is said to be no evidence of the use of آباد as<br>\
a pl. of أَبَدٌ in a general way by the Arabs of the<br>\
classical ages, as it is here added merely as a corroborative, as آزال is in the phrase أَزَلَ الآزَالِ;<br>\
(MF;) and أَبَدَ الأَبَدِينَ, (M, A, K,) in which the<br>\
latter word is not a rel. n., for if so it would be<br>\
الأَبَدِيِّينَ, but app. a pl., (M,) like أَرَضُونَ; (M,<br>\
K;) and ↓ أَبَدَ الآبِدِينَ, (S, K,) like as you say,<br>\
دَهْرَ الآبِدِينَ; (S;) and ↓ أَبَدَ الأَبَدِيَّةِ; (M, K;)<br>\
and ↓ أَبَدَ الأَبِيدِ; (T, S, M, A, K;) and أَبِيدَ<br>\
↓ الأَبِيدِ; (M, K;) and أَبَدَ الأَبَدِ; (K;) and أَبَدَ<br>\
الدَّهْرِ; (M, K; [in the T يَدَ الدَّهْرِ;]) all of<br>\
which phrases are the same in meaning; (K;)<br>\
[i. e. I will not do it, and I will not come to him,<br>\
(or لا آتيه may here mean the same as لا افعله,)<br>\
during the endless space of all future times, or time;<br>\
or the like; or for ever and ever;<br>\
εἰ� αἰῶνα τῶν αἰώνων<br>\
; in seculum seculorum; in omne ævum;]<br>\
the last word in every case being a corroborative.<br>\
(MF.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, [for ذُو أَبَدٍ, and (applied to a<br>\
fem. n.) ذَاتُ أَبَدٍ,] Lasting: or everlasting. (S,<br>\
A, K.) So in the saying, الدُّنيَاء أَمَدٌ وَالآخِرَةُ أَبَدٌ<br>\
[The present state of existence is limited in duration, but the final state of existence is everlasting].<br>\
(&#39;Obeyd Ibn-&#39;Omeyr and L.) And الأَبَدُ signifies<br>\
[The Everlasting; i. e. God; because He alone<br>\
is ↓ البَاقِى الأَبَدِيّ The Enduring without end or<br>\
cessation; for the Muslims hold that all living<br>\
creatures (even the angels) must die, and be<br>\
raised again to life: or] The Ancient without<br>\
beginning. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Offspring that is a year<br>\
old. (K.)<br>\
أَبِدٌ Unsocial, unsociable, unfamiliar, or shy;<br>\
like a wild animal; applied to a man, and to a<br>\
young camel: (S, L:) and ↓ إِبِدٌ, applied to a<br>\
female slave, and to a she-ass, signifies shunning<br>\
mankind, shy, or wild. (K.) [See also آبِدٌ.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also إِبِدٌ, in four places.<br>\
إِبِدٌ: see أَبِدٌ.<br>\
-A2-  This word, (Lth, ISh, S, K,)<br>\
said by Lth and ISh to be the only word of its<br>\
measure heard from the Arabs except إِبِلٌ and<br>\
نِكِحٌ and خِطِبٌ, but Az says that he had not<br>\
heard the last two from any person worthy of<br>\
reliance, and that they are pronounced نِكْحٌ and<br>\
خِطْبٌ, (L,) [see إِبِلٌ,] and ↓ أَبِدٌ and ↓ إِبْدٌ, (K,)<br>\
which are thought by Az to be dial. vars. of the<br>\
first, (L,) applied to a female slave, and to a<br>\
she-ass, signify Prolific; that breeds, or brings<br>\
forth, plentifully; (S, K;) and ↓ أَبِدٌ and ↓ أَبِدَةٌ<br>\
(Aboo-Málik, TA) and ↓ إِبِدَةٌ, (Aboo-Málik, K,)<br>\
applied to a she-camel, signify the same: (Aboo-Málik, K, TA:) and إِبِدٌ (Lth, ISh, L) and ↓ أَبِدٌ,<br>\
(M, L,) applied to a female slave, (M, L,) and<br>\
to a she-ass, (Lth, ISh, M, L,) and to a mare,<br>\
(M, L,) that brings forth every year; (Lth, ISh,<br>\
L;) or applied as a pl. to the female slave and<br>\
the mare and the she-ass, that breed, or bring<br>\
forth: (M, L:) and الإِبِدَانِ the female slave and<br>\
the mare. (K, TA.) In the following saying,<br>\
الَّابِجَدِّ ذِى الإِبِدْ  لَنْ يُقْلِعَ الجَدُّ النَّكِدْ<br>\
فِى كُلِّ مَا عَامٍ تَلِدْ<br>\
[Hard fortune will not depart save with the fortune which is the necessary attendant of the possessor of the female slave, as long as he possesses<br>\
her, (or, if we take ذى in the sense of هٰذِهِ, save<br>\
with the fortune of this female slave,) who every<br>\
year (ما being redundant) brings forth,] الابد<br>\
means the female slave because her being prolific<br>\
is an obstacle to prosperity, and is not good fortune; i. e., she only increases evil [and brings<br>\
reproach upon her master by bearing him children;<br>\
for the Arab in ancient times was considered as<br>\
dishonoured by his having a child by a slave].<br>\
(S.) The Arabs also said, لَنْ يَبْلُغَ الجَدَّ النَّكِدْ<br>\
↓ الاَّ الأَبِدْ, meaning Nothing will attain to the<br>\
object of removing hard fortune save female<br>\
slaves and beasts or cattle which breed, or bring<br>\
forth. (M, L: [in the latter of which is added,<br>\
فِى كُلِّ عَامٍ تَلِدْ in every year bringing forth.])<br>\
أَبِدَةٌ: see إِبِدٌ.<br>\
إِبِدَةٌ: see إِبِدٌ.<br>\
أَبَدِىٌّ: see أَبَدٌ, last sentence but one.<br>\
أَبَدِيَّةٌ [The quality, or attribute, of unlimited,<br>\
indivisible, or endless, duration; everlastingness].<br>\
(M, K.) See أَبَدٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  أَبَدِيَّاتٌ a term applied to<br>\
Sayings of which the following is an ex.: لَا آتِيكَ<br>\
مَا بَلَّ بَحْرٌ صُوفَةً. (M in art. صوف [q. v.]; &amp;c.)<br>\
أَبُودٌ: see آبِدٌ.<br>\
أَبِيدٌ: see أَبَدٌ, in three places.<br>\
آبِدٌ Remaining, staying, abiding, or dwelling,<br>\

also ↓ مُتَأَبِّدٌ. (A.) Wild animals are called أَوَابِدُ<br>\
(S, M, L, K) and أُبَّدٌ (M, L, K) because they<br>\
endure for a long, or [naturally] unlimited, time;<br>\
(M, L;) because they do not die a natural death,<br>\
(As, M, L, K,) but from some evil accident; and<br>\
the same is asserted of the serpent. (As, M, L.)<br>\
[See also أَبِدٌ.] [Hence,] قَيْدُ الأَوَابِدِ (assumed tropical:)  The light,<br>\
or active, horse, which overtakes the wild animals,<br>\
and which they can hardly, or never, escape: so<br>\
called because he prevents their escaping the<br>\
pursuer like a shackle. (Msb.) [See also art. قيد.]<br>\
[Hence also the saying,] النِّعَمُ أَوَابِدُ فَقَيِّدُوهَا بِالشُّكْرِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Benefits are fugitive, or fleeting; therefore detain ye them by gratitude]. (A trad.)<br>\
آبِدَةٌ fem. of آبِدٌ, q. v. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, [as a subst.,]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A deed, (Har p. 364,) or a calamity, (S, M,<br>\

strange, an unusual, or an unfamiliar, word or<br>\
saying; one far from being intelligible; (M;)<br>\

verses, or poems; syn. شَوَارِدُ مِنَ القَوَافِى, (S,) or<br>\

verses by arrogating to yourselves the verses of<br>\
