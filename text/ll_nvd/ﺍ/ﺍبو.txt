أَبَوْتُ, [third pers. أَبَا,] (T, S, M, K,) and<br>\
أَبَيْتُ, [third pers. أَبَى,] (T, M, K,) the latter accord. to Yz, (T,) aor. آبُو, (TK,) inf. n. أُبُوَّةٌ, (Yz,<br>\
T, S, Msb,) or this is a simple subst., (M,) I became a father. (T, * S, * M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَبَوْتُهُ, (ISk, T,<br>\
M, K,) aor. آبُوهُ, (IAar, ISk, T,) inf. n. إِبَاوَةٌ,<br>\
(M, K,) I was, (IAar, ISk, T,) or became, (M,<br>\
K,) a father to him. (IAar, ISk, T, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence, I fed him, or nourished him; and reared<br>\
him, or brought him up.] You say, فُلَانٌ يَأْبُو هٰذَا<br>\
اليَتِيمَ, inf. n. إِبَاوَةٌ, Such a one feeds, or nourishes,<br>\
this orphan, like as the father does his children.<br>\
(Lth, T.) And مَالَهُ أَبٌ يَأْبُوهُ (ISk, T, S) He has<br>\
not a father to feed him, or nourish him, and to<br>\
rear him, or bring him up. (S.)<br>\
2<br>\
أَبَّيْتُهُ, inf. n. تَأْبِيَةٌ, I said to him بِأَبِى [meaning فُدِيَتِ بِأَبِى Mayest thou be ransomed with my<br>\
father! or the like: see أَبٌ, below]. (K, TA.<br>\
[In the CK, erroneously, يا اَبِى.])<br>\
5<br>\
تأبّاهُ He adopted him as a father; (M, K,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ استأباهُ; (M in art. اب;) and so<br>\
تأبّاهُ أَبًا, accord. to A&#39;Obeyd: (TA:) [or,] accord.<br>\
to A&#39;Obeyd, you say, تَأَبَّيْتُ أَبًا I adopted a father:<br>\
(T:) and you say also, اِسْتَأَبَّ أَبًا and اِسْتَأْبَبَ أَبًا<br>\
he adopted a father. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَاْبَوَ see 5.<br>\
أَبٌ is originally أَبَوٌ, (S, Msb, K,) as is shown<br>\
by the first of its dual forms and of its pl. forms<br>\
mentioned below; (S, Msb;) and signifies A<br>\
father [in the ordinary sense: and also as meaning (assumed tropical:)  an ancestor]: (M:) as also ↓ أَبًا, a dial. var.,<br>\
(M, K,) the same in the nom. and accus. and gen.<br>\
cases, like قَفًا: (M:) and أَبٌّ is a dial. var. of the<br>\
same, [the second letter being doubled to compensate for the و suppressed, as is the case in أَخٌّ,<br>\
(TA voce أَخٌ)] but is rare. (Msb.) Accord. to<br>\
the dial. commonly obtaining, when you use it as<br>\
a prefixed noun, you decline it with the letters و<br>\
and ا and ى, saying, هٰذَاأَبُوهُ [This is his father],<br>\
(Msb,) and أَبُوكَ [thy father]; (M;) and رَأَيْتُ أَبَاهُ<br>\
[I saw his father]; and مَرَرْتُ بِأَبِيهِ [I passed by<br>\
his father]: (Msb:) but accord. to one dial.,<br>\
you say, هٰذَا أَبَاهُ, (Msb:) and أَبَاكَ; (M;) and<br>\
رَأَيْتُ أَبَاهُ; and مَرَرْتُ بِأَبَاهُ: (Msb:) and accord.<br>\
to one dial., which is the rarest of all, it is defective in every case, like يَدٌ and دَمٌ; (Msb;) and<br>\
[thus] you say, هٰذَا أَبُوكَ [&amp;c.]. (M.) The dual is<br>\
أَبَوَانِ, (S, M, Msb,) meaning [two fathers, and]<br>\
father and mother; and some say أَبَانِ: (S, M:)<br>\
you say, هُمَاأَبَوَاهُ, meaning They two are his<br>\
father and mother; and in poetry you may say,<br>\
هُمَا أَبَاهُ; and in like manner, رَأَيْتُ أَبَيْهِ [I saw his<br>\
father and mother], (T,) and أَبَيْكَ [thy father<br>\
and mother]; (S;) but the usual, or chaste, form<br>\
is رَأَيْتُ أَبَوَيْهِ. (T.) The pl. is آبَآءٌ, (T, S, M, Msb,<br>\
K,) the best form, (T,) and أَبُونَ, (T, S, M, K,)<br>\
and أُبُوٌّ (M, K, [in the CK الاَبْوٌ is erroneously<br>\
put for الأُبُوٌّ,]) and أُبُوَّةٌ, (Lh, T, S, M, K, *) like<br>\
عُمُومَةٌ and خُؤُولَةٌ: (T, S:) you say, هٰؤُلَآءِ أَبُوكُمْ,<br>\
meaning آبَاؤُكُمْ [These are your fathers]; (T;)<br>\
and hence, in the Kur [ii. 127], accord. to one<br>\
reading, وَإِلٰهَ أَبِيكَ إِبرٰهِيمَ وَإِسْمٰعِيلَ وَإِسْحٰقَ [And<br>\
the God of thy fathers, Abraham and Ishmael<br>\
and Isaac], meaning the pl. of أبٌ, i. e. أَبِينَكَ, of<br>\
which the ن is suppressed because the noun is<br>\
prefixed [to the pronoun]; (S;) and some of the<br>\
Arabs say, أَبُوَّتُنَا أَكْرَمُ الآبَآءِ [Our fathers are the<br>\
most generous of fathers]. (T.) The dim. is ↓ أُبَّىٌّ;<br>\
originally أُبَيْوٌ, with the final radical letter restored.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَا يَدْرِى لَهُ مِنْ أَبٍ, and مَا أَبٌ, mean-<br>\
ing He knows not who is his father, and what is<br>\
his father, are sayings mentioned by Lh on the<br>\
authority of Ks. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  لَا أَبَا لِكَ, (T, S, M, K,<br>\
&amp;c.,) [accord. to the dial. of him who says أَبًا instead of أَبٌ,] as also لَا أَبَ لَكَ, and لَا أَبَاكَ, (S, K,)<br>\
[the last, accord. to J, because the ل (meaning<br>\
the ل in لك in the preceding phrases) is as though<br>\
it were redundant, but he seems not to have<br>\
known the dial. var. أَبًا, and I rather think that<br>\
لَا أَبَاكَ, is for لَا أَبْقَى اللّٰهُ أَبَاكَ, or the like,] and<br>\
لَا أَبَكَ, (Mbr, Sgh, K,) and لَابَ لَكَ, (K,) which<br>\
is for لَا أَبَ لَكَ, (M,) means Thou art, in my estimation, one deserving of its being said to him,<br>\
Mayest thou have no father! it is used in the<br>\
manner of a proverb, is of frequent occurrence in<br>\
poetry, (M,) is said to him who has a father and<br>\
to him who has not a father, and is an imprecation as to the meaning, of necessity, though enunciative as to the letter; (M, K;) and hence the<br>\
saying of Jereer,<br>\
يَا تَيْمُ تَيْمَ عَدِىٍّ لَا أَبَا لَكُمْ<br>\
[O Teym, Teym of &#39;Ades, may ye have no<br>\
father!]; which is the strongest evidence of its<br>\
being a proverb, and not having a literal meaning;<br>\
for all of [the tribe of] Teym could not have one<br>\
father, but all of them were fit objects of imprecation and rough speech: (M:) it is an expression<br>\
of praise: (S:) [i. e.] it is an imprecation against<br>\
him to whom it is addressed, not, however, said<br>\
with the desire of its having effect, but on an<br>\
occasion of intense love, like لَا أُمَّ لَكَ, &amp;c.: (Har<br>\
p. 165:) and sometimes in dispraise, like لَا أُمَّ لَكَ:<br>\
and in wonder, like لِلّهِ دَرُّكَ: (TA:) or, as A<br>\
Heyth says, on the authority of Aboo-Sa&#39;eed Ed-<br>\
Dareer, it expresses the utmost degree of reviling;<br>\
[meaning Thou hast no known father;] and<br>\
لَا أُمَّ لَكَ expresses reviling also, but means Thou<br>\
hast no free, or ingenuous, mother: (Meyd in<br>\
Har p. 165: [see أُمَّ:]) sometimes it means<br>\
Strive, or exert thyself, in thine affair; for he<br>\
who has a father relies upon him in some circumstances of his case: (TA:) accord. to Kh, it means<br>\
Thou hast none to stand thee in stead of thyself:<br>\
(ISh, TA:) Fr says that it is a phrase used by<br>\
the Arabs [parenthetically, i.e.,] to divide their<br>\
speech: (TA:) [thus, for instance,] Zufar Ibn-El-Hárith says,<br>\
أَرِينِى سِلَاحِى لَا أَبَا لَكَ إِنَّنِى<br>\
أَرَى الحَرْبَ لَا تَزْدَادُ إِلَّا تَمَادِيَا<br>\
[Show thou me my weapons: (mayest thou have<br>\
no father! or thou hast no father: &amp;c.:) verily<br>\
I see the war, or battle, increases not save in perseverance]. (TA.) [Aboo-&#39;Alee, as cited in the M,<br>\
observes that the ا (meaning the final ا) in أَبَا, in<br>\
the phrase لَا أَبَا لَكَ, indicates that it is a prefixed<br>\
noun, and determinate; whereas the ل in لك<br>\
together with the government exercised upon the<br>\
noun by لا indicates that it is, on the contrary,<br>\
indeterminate, and separate from what follows it:<br>\
but it seems that he was unacquainted with the<br>\
dial. var. أَبَّا; for لَا أَبَا لَكَ in the dial. of him who<br>\
uses the form أَبَّا instead of أَبٌ is the same grammatically as لَا أَبَ لَكَ in the dial. of him who uses<br>\
the form أَبٌ.] Suleymán Ibn-&#39;Abd-El-Melik<br>\
heard an Arab of the desert, in a year of drought,<br>\
say, أَنْزِلْ عَلَيْنَا الغَيْثَ لَا أَبَا لَكَ, and Suleymán put<br>\
the best construction upon it, [as though it meant,<br>\
Send down upon us rain: Thou hast no father],<br>\
and said, I testify that He hath no father nor<br>\
female companion nor offspring. (TA.) They say<br>\
also, in paying honour [to a person], لَا أَبَ لِشَانِئِكَ,<br>\
and لَا أَبَ لِشَانِئِكَ, (TA,) i. e. May thy hater have<br>\
no father! or, accord. to ISk, each is a metonymical expression for لَا أَبَا لَكَ. (S in art. شنأ,<br>\
q. v.) ―<br>\
-b4-  One also says, on the occasion of an<br>\
occurrence that is approved and commended, by<br>\
way of expressing wonder and praise, لَلِّهِ أَبُوكَ,<br>\
meaning To God, purely, is attributable [the<br>\
excellence of] thy father, seeing that he begat thee<br>\
a generous son, and produced the like of thee!<br>\
(TA;) [or to God be attributed (the excellence<br>\
of) thy father!] it means that to God [alone]<br>\
belongs the power to create the like of this man<br>\
[to whom it relates], from whom has proceeded<br>\
this wonderful action. (Har p. 44.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
هِىَ بِنْتُ أَبِيهَا, meaning She resembles her father<br>\
in strength of mind, or spirit, and sharpness of<br>\
disposition, and in hastening, or striving to be<br>\
first, to do things: said of Hafsah, by &#39;Áïsheh.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  بِأَبِى, (TA,) or بِأَبِى أَنْتَ, (T in art. بأ,)<br>\
[said to a person,] means [فُدِيتَ بِأَبِى Mayest<br>\
thou be ransomed with my father! (see the next<br>\
sentence but one;) or] أَفْدِيكَ بِأَبِى [I will ransom thee with my father]; (T ubi suprà;) or<br>\
أَنْتَ مَفْدِىٌّ بِأَبِى Thou art, or shalt be, ransomed<br>\
with my father]; or فَدَيُتُكَ بِأَبِى [I have in my<br>\
heart ransomed thee, or I would ransom thee, with<br>\
my father]; the ب being dependent upon a word<br>\
suppressed, which, accord. to some, is a [pass.<br>\
participial] noun, and accord. to others, a verb;<br>\
and this word is suppressed because of the frequent usage of the phrase. (TA.) You say also,<br>\
بِأَبِى أَنْتَ وَ أُمِّى [With my father mayest thou be<br>\
ransomed, and with my mother!]. (TA.) And<br>\
بِأَبِى مَنْ وَدَدتُّهُ, i. e. فُدِىَ بِأَبِى مَنْ وَدَدتُّهُ [May<br>\
he whom I love be ransomed with my father!],<br>\
meaning may he [my father] be made a ransom<br>\
for him [whom I love]! (El-Wáhidee on the<br>\
Deewán of El-Mutanebbee, in De Sacy&#39;s Chrest.<br>\
Arabe, sec. ed. vol. iii. p. 35 of the Arabic text.)<br>\
Sometimes they change the ى into ا: a poet<br>\
says,<br>\
وَقَدْ زَعَمُوا أَنِّى جَزِعْتُ عَلَيْهِمَا<br>\
وَهَلْ جَزَعٌ أَنْ قُلْتُ وَا بِأَبَا هُمَا<br>\
[And they have asserted that I have become impatient on account of them two: but is it an evidence of impatience that I said, Alas, with my<br>\
father may they two be ransomed?]; meaning<br>\
وَا بِأَبِى هُمَا. (S.) And some of the Arabs used to<br>\
say, وَا بِأَبَا أَنْتَ [Alas, with my father mayest thou<br>\
be ransomed!]: this, says AM, being like يَا وَيْلَتَا<br>\
for يَا وَيْلَتِى; as also يَا بَيْبَا, with the hemzeh<br>\
changed into ى, originally يَا بِأَبَا, meaning يَابِأَبِى:<br>\
and hence what is related, in a trad., of Umm-<br>\
&#39;Ateeyeh; that she used not to mention the Prophet without saying, بِيَبَا [for بِأَبِ هُوَ]. (TA in<br>\
art. بأ.) A woman said,<br>\
يَا بِأَبِى أَنْتَ وَ يَا فَوْقَ البِيَبْ<br>\
[O thou to whom I would say, With my father<br>\
mayest thou be ransomed! and O thou who art<br>\
above him to whom I would address the saying,<br>\
With my father mayest thou be ransomed!]; respecting which Fr observes that the two words<br>\
[بِ and أَب] are made as one [by prefixing the<br>\
article] because of their frequent occurrence; (S;)<br>\
and Aboo-&#39;Alee says that the ى in بِيَب is substituted for ء, not necessarily; but ISk quotes the<br>\
words as commencing with يَا بِيَبَا, which is the<br>\
right reading, in order that this expression may<br>\
agree with البِئَبْ, which is derived from it: EtTebreezee, however, relates Abu-l-&#39;Alà&#39;s reciting<br>\
the words as ending with البِئَبْ; saying that this<br>\
is compounded from the phrase بِأَبِي, and that<br>\
therefore the ء is preserved. (TA.) [See also the<br>\
first paragraph in art. بأ.] ―<br>\
-b7-  You say also, يَا أَبَتِ<br>\
[meaning O my father], (S, M, K,) as in يَا أَبَتِ<br>\
افْعَلْ [O my father, do thou such a thing]; (S;)<br>\
and يَا أَبَتَ; (S, M, K;) and يَاأَبَتُ; (Z in the<br>\
Ksh xii. 4;) and يَا أَبَهْ (S, M, K) when you pause<br>\
after it. (S, M.) The ة, [here written ت,] (Kh,<br>\
M,) the sign of the fem. gender, (S, Z,) is substituted for the [pronominal] affix ى, (Kh, S, M, Z,)<br>\
as in يَاأُمَّتِ; (S;) and is like the ة in عَمَةٌ and<br>\
خَالَةٌ, as is shown by your saying, in pausing,<br>\
يَا أَبَهٌ, like as you say, يَا خَالَةٌ: (Kh, M:)<br>\
the annexing of the fem. ت to a masc. noun<br>\
in this case is allowable, like as it is in حَمَامَةٌ ذَكَرٌ<br>\
and شَاةٌ ذَكَرٌ and رَجُلٌ رَبْعَةٌ and غَلَامٌ يَفَعَةٌ: its<br>\
being made a substitute for the affix ى is allowable because each of these is an augmentative<br>\
added at the end of a noun: and the kesreh is the<br>\
same that is in the phrase يَا أَبِى: (Z ubi suprà:)<br>\
the ت does not fall from اب in the phrase يَا أَبَتِ<br>\
when there is no pause after it, though it [sometimes] does from أُمّ in the like phrase in that<br>\
case, because the former word, being of [only]<br>\
two letters, is as though it were defective. (S.)<br>\
يَا أَبَتَ is for يَا أَبَتَا, (Aboo-&#39;Othmán El-Mázinee,<br>\
S, * M, [the latter expression mentioned also in<br>\
the K, but not as being the original of the former,])<br>\
the ا [and ه] being suppressed; (the same Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Othmán and M;) or for يَا أَبَتَا, the ا being suppressed, like as the ى is in يَا غُلَامِ; or it may be<br>\
after the manner of يَاأَبِىَ. (Z ubi suprà.) يَا أَبَتُ<br>\
is thus pronounced after the usual manner of a<br>\
noun ending with the fem. ة, without regard to<br>\
the fact that the ت is in the former a substitute<br>\
for the suffix ى. (Z ubi suprà.) يَا أَبَهْ is said in a<br>\
case of pause, except in the Kur-án, in which, in<br>\
this case, you say, يَا أَبَهْ, following the written<br>\
text; and some of the Arabs pronounce the fem. ة,<br>\
in a case of pause, ت [in other instances], thus<br>\
saying, يَا طَلْحَتُ. (S.) يَا أَبَاهُ is also said; (M,<br>\
K;) though scarcely ever. (M.) A poet uses the<br>\
expression يَا أَبَاتَ, for يَا أَبَتَاهْ: (S, M:) IB says<br>\
that this is used only by poetic license, in a case<br>\
of necessity in verse. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  أَبٌ is tropically<br>\
applied to signify (tropical:)  A grandfather, or any ancestor. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b9-  It is also applied to signify (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
paternal uncle; as in the Kur ii. 127, quoted<br>\
before. (M.) ―<br>\
-b10-  [It is also (like أُمّ and اِبْن and<br>\
بِنْت) prefixed to nouns of various significations.<br>\
Most of the compounds thus formed will be found<br>\
explained in the arts. to which belong the nouns<br>\
that occupy the second place. The following are<br>\
among the more common, and are therefore here<br>\
mentioned, as exs. of different kinds.] ―<br>\
-b11-  أَبُو المَرْأَةِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The woman&#39;s husband: (Ibn-Habeeb, M:) it is<br>\
said in the TS that الأَبُ, in certain of the dials.,<br>\
signifies the husband: MF deems this meaning<br>\
strange. (TA.) أَبُو المَثْوَى (assumed tropical:)  The master of the<br>\
dwelling, or of the place of abode: (TA:) and<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  the guest. (K in art. ثوى.) أَبُو الأَضْيَافِ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
very hospitable man. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-  أَبُو الحَارِثِ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
lion. (TA.) أَبُو جَعْدَةَ (assumed tropical:)  The wolf. (TA.) أَبُو<br>\
الحُصَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  The fox. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b13-  أَبُو جَابِر (assumed tropical:)  Bread. (S<br>\
and K in art. جبر.) ―<br>\
-b14-  أَبُو مَالِكٍ (assumed tropical:)  Extreme old age:<br>\
(TA:) and (assumed tropical:)  hunger. (MF in art. جبر.)<br>\

أُبُوَةٌ [in copies of the K ↓ إِبْوَآء, and in the CK<br>\

of fathership]. (S.)<br>\
