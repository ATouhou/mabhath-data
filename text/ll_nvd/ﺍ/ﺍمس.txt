load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'امسإَمْس, meaning Yesterday, or the day before<br>\
the present day (Msb, K) by one night, (K,) and<br>\
tropically applied to (tropical:)  what is before that, (Msb,)<br>\
or a short time before, (Bd in x. 25,) [used as a<br>\
subst. and as an adv.,] is indecl., with any of the<br>\
three vowels for its termination: (K:) [written<br>\
أَمْسِ and أمْسَ and أمْسُ:] or it is an adv. n.,<br>\
indecl., with kesr for its termination, unless made<br>\
indeterminate, or made determinate [be the article<br>\
ال]; and sometimes indecl. with fet-h: (EzZejjájee, M, TA:) or, accord. to I Hsh, the termination with fet-h is a rejected form; and that with<br>\
damm is not mentioned by any of the grammarians: (TA:) but مُذْ أَمْسَ [Since yesterday]<br>\
occurs, used by poetic licence: (Sb, S:) أَمْس is<br>\
a noun of which the last letter is made movent to<br>\
avoid the concurrence of two quiescent letters:<br>\
and the Arabs differ respecting it: (S:) most of<br>\
them make it indecl., with kesr for its termination,<br>\
when it is determinate [without the article ال]:<br>\
but some of them make it [imperfectly] decl.<br>\
when it is determinate [in the same manner]: (S,<br>\
K: *) [accord. to the most approved usage,] you<br>\
say, [رَأَيْتُهُ أَمْسِ, and بِالأَمْسِ, which is more common, and الأَمْسَ, I saw him yesterday; and]<br>\
مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْأَمْسِ [I have not seen him since<br>\
yesterday]; and if you have not seen him [since<br>\
the day next] before that, you say, مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْ أَوَّلُ<br>\
مِنْ أَمْسِ [I have not seen him since the day<br>\
before yesterday]; and if you have not seen him<br>\
[since] two days before that, you say, مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْ<br>\
أَوَّلُ مِنْ أَوَّلَ مِنْ أَمْسِ [I have not seen him since<br>\
the day before the day before yesterday]. (ISk,<br>\
TA.) The phrase رَأَيْتُهُ أَمْسٍ [I saw him yesterday] has also been heard, but it is extr. (K.)<br>\
The people of El-Hijáz make أَمْس indecl., with<br>\
kesr for its termination; and the Benoo-Temeem<br>\
do the same when it is in the accus. or gen. case;<br>\
but these latter make it [imperfectly] decl. when<br>\
it is in the nom. case, saying, ذَهَبَ أَمْسُ بِمَا فِيهِ<br>\
[Yesterday has gone with what happened during<br>\
it]; whereas the people of El-Hijáz say, ذَهَبَ<br>\
أَمْسِ بِمَا فِيهِ, because it is [held by them to be]<br>\
indecl. on account of its implying that it has the<br>\
determinative article ال [understood as prefixed<br>\
to it], the kesreh being added to avoid the<br>\
concurrence of two quiescent letters; while the<br>\
Benoo-Temeem hold it to be, in the nom. case,<br>\
a deviation from الإَمْسُ, and therefore imperfectly<br>\
decl., because of its being determinate, [and so<br>\
resembling a proper name,] and its deviation from<br>\
the original form, like سَحَرُ in the like case: (IB,<br>\
TA:) all of the Arabs, however, make it decl.<br>\
when the article ال is prefixed to it, (S, K, *)<br>\
and when it is made indeterminate, or is prefixed<br>\
to another noun: (S:) they say, using it indeterminately, كُلُّ غَدٍ صَائِرٌ أَمْسٍا [Every morrow becomes a yesterday]; (S, * IB;) and making it<br>\
determinate by the article ال, they say, كَانَ<br>\
الأَمْسُ طَيِّبًا [The yesterday was good], (IB,) and<br>\
مَضَي الأَمْسُ المُبَارَكُ [The blessed yesterday has<br>\
past]; (S;) and prefixing it to another noun,<br>\
كُلُّ أَمْسِنَا كَانَ طَيِّبًا [All of our yesterday was<br>\
good], (IB,) and مَضَى أَمْسُنَا [Our yesterday has<br>\
past]: (S:) [therefore,] in the following verse,<br>\
وَإِنِّى وَقَفْتُ اليَوْمَ وَالأَمْسِ قَبْلَهُ<br>\
بِبَابِكَ حَتَّى كَادَتِ الشَّمْسُ تَغْرُبُ<br>\
[And verily I stood to-day, and yesterday before<br>\
it, at thy door until the sun was almost setting],<br>\
(thus related by IAar in two different ways,<br>\
الأَمْسِ and الأَمْسَ,) if we read الأَمْسِ, the ال is<br>\
redundant, because it is implied in the word<br>\
أَمْسِ; but if we read الأَمْسَ, the ال is not implied<br>\
in أَمْسَ, and therefore is prefixed to make it determinate. (IJ, M.) The pl. is آمُسٌ and آمَاسٌ,<br>\
(Zj, K,) both pls. of pauc., (Zj, TA,) and أمُوسٌ,<br>\
(Zj, K, TA, [in the CK, incorrectly, امُوْسٌ,])<br>\
which is a pl. of mult. (Zj, TA.) There is no<br>\
dim. form of أَمْس; like as there is none of غَدٌ<br>\
and البَارِحَةُ and كَيْفَ and أَيْنَ and مَتَى and أَىُّ<br>\
and مَا and عِندَ and the names of the months and<br>\
those of the days of the week, except الجُمْعَةُ.<br>\
(Sb, S.)<br>\
إِمْسِىٌّ, contr. to analogy, (M, TA,) and أَمْسِىٌّ<br>\
[which is agreeable with analogy] is allowable,<br>\
as related by Sgh on the authority of Fr, but the<br>\
former is the more chaste, (TA,) Of, or relating<br>\
to, or belonging to, yesterday. (M, TA.)<br>\
