أخّر, (S, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. تَأْخِيرٌ, (K,) is trans.<br>\

recede, retreat, retire, or retrograde: he put, or<br>\
drove, back: he put, or placed, behind, or after;<br>\

back, hang back, or lag behind: he kept, or held,<br>\
back: he postponed, put off, procrastinated, deferred, delayed, or retarded: he made backward,<br>\
or late: contr. of قَدَّمَ. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَخَّرَنِى<br>\
إِلَى مُدَّةٍ He granted me a delay, or postponement,<br>\
to a certain term, or period. (TA in art. اجل.)<br>\
-A2-  For its significations as an intrans. verb, see 5,<br>\
in two places.<br>\

تأخّر is quasi-pass. of the trans. verb أخّر;<br>\
(S, A, Msb;) i. e. He, or it, went back or backwards, drew back, receded, retreated, retired, or<br>\

تَقَدَّمَ: (TA:) and ↓ استأخَر is syn. therewith;<br>\
(S, K:) and ↓ أخّر, inf. n. تَأْخِيرٌ, signifies the<br>\
same, being intrans. as well as trans. (K.) An<br>\
ex. of the latter occurs in a saying of Mohammad<br>\
to &#39;Omar: عَنّىِ ↓ أَخِّرْ Retire thou from me: or<br>\
the meaning is, أَخِّرْعَنِّى رَأْيَكَ [hold thou back<br>\
from me thine opinion; or reserve thou thine<br>\
opinion until after mine shall have been given].<br>\
(TA.) You say, تَأَخِّرَ عَنْهُ تَأَخُّرَةً وَاحِدَةً [He went<br>\
back, &amp;c., from him, or it, once]. (Lh.) And<br>\
تأخّر عَنِ الشَّىْءِ, or الأَمْرِ, He went back, &amp;c.,<br>\
from the thing, or the affair: he was, or became,<br>\
behind, behindhand, or backward, with respect to<br>\
it: he held back, hung back, refrained, or abstained, from it; and عَنْهُ ↓ استأخر signifies the<br>\
same. (The Lexicons in many places.) فَإِذَا جَآءَ<br>\
سَاعَةً ↓ أَجَلُهُمْ لَا يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ, in the Kur vii. 32 and<br>\
other places, means And when their time is come,<br>\
for punishment, they will not remain behind, or<br>\
be respited, [any while, or] the shortest time: or<br>\
they shall not seek to remain behind, by reason of<br>\
intense terror. (Bd.)<br>\

إِسْتَاْخَرَ see 5, in three places.<br>\
أَخِرٌ [an epithet variously explained]. One<br>\
says, in reviling, (S, TA,) but not when the<br>\
object is a female, (TA,) أَبْعَدَ اَللّٰهُ الأَخِرَ, (Th, S,<br>\
A, &amp;c.,) and ↓ الآخِرَ (M, &amp;c.,) or this latter is<br>\
wrong, (Meshárik of &#39;Iyád, Mgh, Msb,) as is<br>\
also ↓ الآخَرَ, (Meshárik of &#39;Iyád,) meaning (tropical:)  May<br>\
God alienate, or estrange, from good, or prosperity, or may God curse, him who is absent<br>\
from us, (A, Msb, TA,) distant, or remote:<br>\
(A, Msb:) or the outcast; the alienated: (Msb:)<br>\
or him who is put back, and cast away: so says<br>\
Sh: or, accord. to ISh, him who is put back,<br>\
and remote from good: and he adds, I think<br>\
that ↓ الأَخِير is meant: (L:) or the base fellow :<br>\
or the most ignoble: or the miserable wretch:<br>\
(Et-Tedmuree and others:) or the last speaker:<br>\
(Nawádir of Th:) or الاخر is here a metonymy<br>\
for the devil: (Lb:) it is a word used [for the<br>\
reason explained voce أَبْعَدُ] in relating what has<br>\
been said by one of two persons cursing each<br>\
other, to the other; (Expositions of the Fs;)<br>\
and the phrase above mentioned is meant to<br>\
imply a prayer for those who are present [by<br>\
its contrasting them with the person to whom it<br>\
directly applies]. (A.) One also says, لَا مَرْحَبًا<br>\
بِالْأَخِرِ, [alluding to a particular person,] meaning<br>\
[May the place, or land, not be ample, or spacious,<br>\
or roomy,] to the remote from good. (TA.) It<br>\
is said in a trad. of Mázin, إِنَّ الأَخِرَقَدْ زَنَى<br>\
Verily the outcast, (Mgh, Msb,) or he who is<br>\
remote, and held back, from good,, (Mgh, * TA,)<br>\
hath committed adultery, or fornication: the<br>\
speaker meaning himself; (Mgh, Msb;) as<br>\
though he were an outcast. (Msb.) And in<br>\
another trad. it is said, المَسْأَلَةُ أَخِرُ كَسْبِ المَرْءِ<br>\
Begging is the most ignoble [mode of] gain of<br>\
man: but El-Khattábee relates it with medd,<br>\
[i. e. ↓ آخِرُ,] explaining it as meaning begging is<br>\
the last thing whereby man seeks sustenance when<br>\
unable to gain [by other means]. (TA.)<br>\
أُخُرٌ The back, hinder, or latter, part: the<br>\
hindermost, or last, part: contr. of قُدُمٌ. (K.)<br>\
[See also مُؤَخَّرٌ; from which it appears to be<br>\
distinguished by its being used only adverbially,<br>\
or with a preposition: and see آخِرٌ.] You say,<br>\
شُقَّ ثَوْبُهُ أُخُرًا, and مِنْ أُخُرٍ, (S, K, *) His garment<br>\
was rent, or slit, in its back, or hinder, part,<br>\
(S,) or behind. (K.) And تَأَخَّرَ أُخُرًا [He retired backwards]. (A.) And جَآءِ أُخُرًا: see آخِرٌ,<br>\

بِعْتُهُ بِأَخِرَةٍ I sold it (namely the article of<br>\
merchandise, TA) with postponement of the payment; upon credit; for payment to be made at<br>\
a future period; syn. بِنَظِرةٍ; (S, A, K;) i. e.<br>\

أُخَيْرَى dim. of أُخْرَى, fem. of آخَرُ, q. v. (S.)<br>\
آخَرُ a subst., of the measure أَفْعَلُ, but implying<br>\
the meaning of an epithet, (S,) from أَخَّرَ in the<br>\
sense of تَأَخَّرَ, (TA,) Another; the other; a<br>\
thing [or person] other than the former or first;<br>\
(L;) i. q. غَيْرٌ; (K;) as in the phrases, رَجُلٌ آخَرُ<br>\
another man, and ثَوْبٌ آخَرُ another garment or<br>\
piece of cloth: (TA:) or one of two things<br>\
[or persons]; (S, Sgh, Msb;) as when you say,<br>\
جَآءَ القَوْمُ فَوَاحِدٌ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا وَآخَرُ كَذَا The people<br>\
came, and one was doing thus, and one [i. e.<br>\
another] thus: (Sgh, Msb:) originally meaning<br>\
more backward: (TA:) fem. ↓ أُخْرَى (S, Msb,<br>\
K) and ↓ أُخْرَاةٌ; (K) which latter is not well<br>\
known: (MF:) pl. masc. آخَرُونَ and أُخَرُ; (S,<br>\
K;) [the latter irreg. as such;] and, applied to<br>\
irrational things, أَوَاخِرُ, like as أَفَاضِلُ is pl. of<br>\
أَفْضَلُ: (Msb:) and pl. fem. إُخْرَيَاتٌ and إُخَرُ;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) which latter is imperfectly decl.;<br>\
for an epithet of the measure أَفْعَلُ which is accompanied by مِنْ has no [dual nor] pl. nor fem.<br>\
as long as it is indeterminate; but when it has<br>\
the article ال prefixed to it, or is itself prefixed<br>\
to another noun which it governs in the gen. case,<br>\
it has a dual and a pl. and a fem.; but it is not<br>\
so with آخَرُ; for it has a fem. [and dual] and pl.<br>\
without مِنْ and without the article ال and without its being prefixed to another noun: you say,<br>\
مَرَرْتُ بِرَخُلٍ آخَرَ, and بِرِجَالٍ أُخَرَ and آخَرِينَ,<br>\
and بِاٌمْرَأَةٍ, and بِنِسْوَةٍ [I passed by<br>\
another man, and by other men, and by another<br>\
woman, and by other women;] therefore, as it<br>\
[namely إُخَرُ] is thus made to deviate from its<br>\
original form, [i. e. آخَرُ, (I&#39; Ak p. 287,) which<br>\
is of a class of words used, when indeterminate,<br>\
alike as sing. and dual and pl.,] and is [essentially<br>\
and originally] an epithet, it is imperfectly decl.,<br>\
though a pl.: but when you name thereby a man,<br>\
it is perfectly decl., when inderminate, accord. to<br>\
Akh, or imperfectly decl. accord. to Sb. (S, L.)<br>\
The dim. of آخَرُ is ↓ أُوَيْخِرُ; the ا with the ء<br>\
suppressed following the same rule as the ا in<br>\
ضَارِبٌ: (TA:) and the dim. of إُخْرَى is ↓ أُخَيْرَى.<br>\
(S.) See also الأُخْرَى voce آخِرٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  لَا أَفْعَلُهُ أُخْرَى<br>\
اللَّيَالِى, (S, K,) or اخرى المَنُونِ, (K,) means I<br>\
will not do it ever: (S, K:) or the latter, I will<br>\
not do it to the end of time. (S.) And أُخْرَى<br>\
القَوْمِ, The last of the people. (S, K.) One says,<br>\
جَآءَ فِى أُخْرَى القَوْمِ He came among the last of<br>\
the people. (TA.) And جَآءِ فِى أُخْرَيَاتِ النَّاسِ<br>\
He came among those who were the last of the<br>\
people. (S, A, K.) [See also آخِرٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  In أَبْعَدَ<br>\

فَاعِلٌ, (S,) and ↓ أَخِيرٌ, (S, Msb,) The last; aftermost; hindmost: and the latter; after; hinder:<br>\
and [as a subst.] the end: contr. of أَوَّلُ: [or of<br>\
أَوَّلٌ when used as a subst.:] (A, Msb, K:) or of<br>\
مُتَقَدِّمٌ: (Lth, Msb:) or what is after the first or<br>\
former: (S:) fem. of the former آخِرَةٌ: (S, Msb,<br>\
K:) pl. [masc.] آخِرُونَ (Kur xxvi. 84, &amp;c.,) and<br>\
(masc. and fem., Msb) أَوَاخِرُ (S, Msb) and fem.<br>\
آخِرَاتٌ also: (Th:) and ↓ مَآخِيرُ is syn. with<br>\
أَوَاخِرُ; as in مَآخِيرُاللَّيْلِ [occurring in the S and<br>\
K in art. جهم, meaning The last, or latter, parts,<br>\
or portions, of the night]. (TK in art. جهم.)<br>\
You say, جَآءِ آخِرًا and ↓ أَخِيرًا and ↓ أُخُرًا and<br>\
↓ بِأَخَرَةٍ, all meaning the same [He came lastly, or<br>\
latterly]: and in like manner, ↓ مَا عَرَفْتُهُ إِلَّا أَخِيرًا<br>\
and ↓ الّا بِأَخَرَةٍ [I did not know it save at the last,<br>\

إِذَا أَرَادَ أَنْ يَقُومَ مِنَ المَجْلِسِ ↓ كَانَ يَقُولُ بِأَخَرَةٍ<br>\
كَذَا وَكَذَا He used to say, at the end of his sitting,<br>\
when he desired to rise from the place of assembly,<br>\
thus and thus: or, accord. to IAth, it may mean,<br>\
in the last, or latter, part of his life. (TA.) And<br>\
you say, أَتَيْتُكَ آخِرَ مَرَّتَيْنِ and آخِرَ مَرَّتَيْنِ (IAar,<br>\
M, K. *) And لَا أُكَلِّمُهُ آخِرَ الدَّهْرِ I will not<br>\
