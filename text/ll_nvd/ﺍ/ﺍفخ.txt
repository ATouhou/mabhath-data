أَفَخَهُ, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, L, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
اَفِخَ, inf. n.<br>\
أَفْخٌ, (L,) He, [or it] struck him, or hit him, [or<br>\
hurt him,] on the part of his head called the<br>\
يَأْفُوخ. (A&#39;Obeyd, S, L, Msb, K.) He who pronounces يافوخ without ء says يَفَخَهُ. (Msb.)<br>\
مَأْفُوخٌ A man having his head broken in the<br>\
part called the يَأْفُوخ. (L.)<br>\
يَأْفُوخٌ, (Lth, Az, S, Msb, K,) as also يَافُوخٌ,<br>\
without ء, but the former is the more correct and<br>\
the better, (Lth, Az, Msb,) and is of the measure<br>\
يَفْعُولٌ, (Lth, Az, S, Msb,) whereas the latter is<br>\
of the measure فَاعُولٌ, (Lth, Az, Msb,) [The top,<br>\
vertex, or crown, of the head; or the part of the<br>\
top of the head which is crossed by the coronal<br>\
suture, and comprises a portion of the sagittal<br>\
suture;] the part where the anterior and posterior bones of the head meet; (K;) the place<br>\
that is in a state of commotion in the head of<br>\
an infant; (S;) the place which, in the head<br>\
of a child, does not close up until after some<br>\
years; or does not become knit together in its<br>\
several parts; and this is where the bone of the<br>\
anterior part of the head and that of its posterior<br>\
part meet; (Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán; ”) the<br>\
place that is soft, in a child&#39;s head, before the two<br>\
bones called the نَمَّاغَة and رَمَّاعَة meet, between the<br>\
هَامَة [or middle of the head] and the forehead:<br>\
(L:) or the middle of the head when it has<br>\
become hard and strong; before which it is not<br>\
thus called: (Msb:) pl. يَآفِيخُ; (S;) so in the<br>\
old lexicons [in general]; but in the T and K<br>\
يَوَافِيخُ [which is pl. of يافوخ without ء; or, as pl.<br>\
of يأفوخ, is like تَوَارِيخُ as pl. of تَأْرِيخٌ]; and<br>\
because of this form of the pl., F says that J is<br>\
in error in mentioning the word in the present<br>\
art.: it has been shown, however, that J is not in<br>\
error in this case. (TA.) — [Hence the saying,]<br>\
أَنْتُمْ يَآفِيخُ الشَّرَفِ (tropical:)  Ye are the centres and summits<br>\
of the heads of nobility. (L, from a trad.) And<br>\
يَأْفُوخُ اللَّيْلِ (assumed tropical:)  The main [or middle] part of the<br>\
night. (S, K.) — [See also art. يفخ.]<br>\
