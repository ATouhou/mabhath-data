أَثَفَ القِدْرَ: see 2.<br>\
-A2-  أَثَفَهُ, aor.<br>\
اَثِفَ, (T, S, M,<br>\
K,) inf. n. أَثْفٌ, (T, M,) He followed him. (Ks,<br>\
T, S, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He drove away, or drove away<br>\
and pursued closely, or hunted, him; syn. طَرَدَهُ.<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He sought, or sought after,<br>\
or pursued after, him, or it: in which sense the<br>\
aor. is اثّف القِدٌرَ, (AA, K) and تَأْثِيفٌalso. (So in some copies<br>\
of the K.)<br>\
2<br>\
اثّف القِدْرَ, (T, S, M, K,) inf. n. تَأْثِيفٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
He put the cooking-pot upon the أَثَافِى[pl. of<br>\
أُثْفِيَّةٌ, q. v.]; (T,* S, M,* K;) as also ↓ أَثَفَهَا,<br>\
(M, TA,) inf. n. أَثْفٌ; (TA;) or ↓ آثَفَهَا, (so in<br>\
some copies of the K in art. ثفى,) inf. n. إِيثَافٌ;<br>\
(TA in that art.;) the first of which is a dial. var.<br>\
of ثَفَّاهَا, inf. n. تَثْفِيَةٌ; (S;) and ↓ أَثْفَاهَا, whence<br>\
قِدْرٌ مُؤَثْفَاةٌ. (M.)<br>\
4<br>\
آثَفَ see 2.<br>\
5<br>\
تَأَثًّفَتِ القِدْرُThe cooking-pot was put upon<br>\
the أَثَافِى. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  تَأَثَّفُوهُThey surrounded him,<br>\
or it: (S, K: *) they became around him, or it,<br>\
like the أُثْفِيَّة[or rather like the أَثَافِى]: (M:)<br>\
they collected themselves together around him, or<br>\
it. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2- تأثّف المَكَانَ, (T, S, K,) or بِالمَكَانِ,<br>\
(M,) He (a man, S) kept to the place; (T, K;)<br>\
remained in it; (M;) did not quit it. (AZ, T,<br>\
S, M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  تأثّفهُalso signifies He followed after<br>\
him, and pressed or importuned him, and ceased<br>\
not to incite him. (T, K.) In my opinion, [says<br>\
Az,] this is not in any way derived from الأُثْفِيَّةُ;<br>\
but from أَثَفْتُ الرَّجُلَ, meaning “ I followed the<br>\
man.” (T.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And تأثّفوا عَلَى الأَمْرِThey aided,<br>\
or assisted, one another to do, or accomplish, the<br>\
thing, or affair. (M, L.)<br>\
Q. Q. 1<br>\
أَثْفَى القِدْرَ: see 2. [But accord. to<br>\
Az, in the T, يُؤَثْفِى, as aor. of أَثْفَى, is يُثْفِىreduced to its original form; and the like is said in<br>\
the S and M in art. ثفى. If this be the case,<br>\
مُؤَثْفَاةٌ, q. v., may be مُثْفَاةٌreduced in the same<br>\
manner, i. e., to its original form.]<br>\
أَثِفٌ[probably a mistake for ↓آثِفٌ] Continuing,<br>\
permanent, constant, firm, or established: (K,<br>\
TA:) so in the Moheet. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K, and<br>\
so in a copy of the S,) or ↓ آثِفٌ, [agreeably with<br>\
analogy, and therefore more probably the correct<br>\
form,] (so in other copies of the S and in the T,)<br>\
Following. (Ks, T, S, K.)<br>\
أُثْفِيَّةٌand إِثْفِيَّةٌ[the former of which is the more<br>\
common, and this only I find in copies of the T,]<br>\
The stone [which is one of the three] whereon the<br>\
cooking-pot is placed: (A&#39;Obeyd, M, K:) it is,<br>\
with the Arabs, a stone like the head of a man: (T:)<br>\
the pl. is أَثَافِيُّand أَثَافٍ; (T, S, [in which latter<br>\
it is written differently in different copies, with<br>\
the article prefixed, الأَثَافِيُّand الأَثَافِي, but in<br>\
both manners in art. ثفى,] M, K;) the latter<br>\
being allowable; (T,) or, accord. to Akh, the<br>\
latter only is used by the Arabs; (M;) applied<br>\
to the three stones mentioned above: (TA in art.<br>\
سفع; &amp;c.:) upon these the cooking-pot is set up;<br>\
but what is of iron, having three legs, is not<br>\
called اثفيّة, but مِنْصَبٌ; (T;) [and this is what<br>\
is meant by أَثْفِيَّةٌ مِنْ حَدِيدٍin art. سفعin the K;]<br>\
i. e. an iron trivet upon which a cooking-pot is<br>\
set up. (TA in art. نصب.) أُثْفيَّةٌmay be of the<br>\
measure فُعْلُويَةٌ[from اثف], and it may be of<br>\
the measure أُفْعُولَةٌ[from ثفى; in either case<br>\
originally أُثْفُويَةٌ]. (A, L.) ثَالِثَةُ الأَثَافِىsignifies<br>\
The part, not detached, of a mountain; by the<br>\
side of which, two pieces are put [for the cookingpot to be set thereon]. (A&#39;Obeyd, T, K.) And<br>\
hence the saying, (A&#39;Obeyd, T,) رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ بثَالِثَةِ,<br>\
الأَثَافِي(A&#39;Obeyd, T, K) May God smite him<br>\
with the mountain; meaning, with a calamity;<br>\
(Th, TA, K in art. ثفى;) with a calamity like the<br>\
mountain [in greatness]; (Th, M;) for when they<br>\
do not find the third of the اثافى, they rest the<br>\
cooking-pot [partly] upon the mountain: (M, K,<br>\
in art. ثفى:) or, with difficulties, or troubles, or<br>\
calamities: (As, T:) or, with all evil; evils being<br>\
likened to one اثفيّةafter another, and the third<br>\
being the last: (T, K:) so says Aboo-Sa&#39;eed:<br>\
(T:) or, with the last of evil; and the last of<br>\
everything hateful: (AO in Har p. 84:) or,<br>\
with a great calamity. (Har ib.) One says also,<br>\
الأَثَافِى فُلَانٌ ثَالِثَةُ, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one is the<br>\
heaviest, most burdensome, or most troublesome, of<br>\
the people. (Har ubi suprà.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence also,]<br>\
الأَثَافِىis a name applied to (assumed tropical:)  certain stars [accord.<br>\
to Ideler, as mentioned by Freytag in his Lex.,<br>\
the stars σand τand υDraconis] over against<br>\
the head of the قِدْر; which is the name of certain<br>\
stars disposed in a round form. (AHát, K.)<br>\
[Also] a name given by the vulgar to (assumed tropical:)  [The three<br>\
chief stars in the constellation called] الشَّلْيَاقُ[i. e.<br>\
Lyra]. (Kzw.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The sing., (K,) i. e. each of<br>\
the two forms thereof, but written in the copies of<br>\
the S with damm [only], (TA in art. ثفى,) or<br>\
[only] the latter, with kesr, (M, and so in the K<br>\
in art. ثفى,) also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A number, (M,) or<br>\
a great number, (K, and so in the S in art. ثفى,)<br>\
and a company, or congregated body, of men:<br>\
(M, K:) pl. as above. (M.) You say, هُمْ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
أُثْفِيَّةٌ وَاحِدَةٌ(assumed tropical:)  [They are against him one band].<br>\
(TA.) And بَقِيَتْ مِنْ بَنِى فُلَانٍ أُثْفِيَّةٌ خَشْنَآءُ<br>\
There remained of the sons of such a one a great<br>\
number. (S in art. ثفى.)<br>\
آثفٌ: see أَثفٌ, in two places.<br>\
مُؤَثَّفٌ(assumed tropical:)  Short, broad, plump, and fleshy. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And, with ة, (tropical:)  A woman whose husband has<br>\
two wives beside her; she being the third of them:<br>\
they being likened to the أَثَافِىof the cookingpot. (M.) [See also مُثَفَّاةٌ, in art. ثفى.)<br>\
قِدْرٌ مُؤَثْفَاةٌA cooking-pot put upon the أَثَافِى<br>\
[pl. of أُثْفِيَّةٌ, q. v.]. (M, and K in art. ثفى: in<br>\
some copies of the latter, مؤْثَفَاةٌ.) [See Q. Q. 1.]<br>\
