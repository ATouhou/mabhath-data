load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'اجصإِجَّاصٌ [The plum;] a certain fruit, (K, TA,)<br>\
of the description termed فَاكِهَة, (TA,) well known;<br>\
(Msb, K;) cold and moist; or, as some say, of<br>\
moderate temperature; (TA;) which facilitates<br>\
the flow of the yellow bile; (K;) i. e., its juice, or<br>\
water, does so, when drunk with sugar-candy<br>\
(طَبَرْزَذ) and manna (تَرَنْجُبِين) added to it;<br>\
(TA;) and allays thirst, and heat of the heart;<br>\
(K;) but it relaxes the stomach, and does not<br>\
agree with it; and it generates a watery mixture;<br>\
and its injurious effect is repelled by the drinking<br>\
of sugary سِكَنْجُبِين [or oxymel]: it is of several<br>\
kinds: (TA:) [the most common is the Damasc,<br>\
or Damascene, plum:] the best is (K, TA) the<br>\
Armenian, (TA,) that which is sweet and large:<br>\
(K, TA:) the sour, or acid, is less laxative, and<br>\
more cold: (TA:) the n. un. is with ة: (S, Msb,<br>\
K:) you should not say إِنْجَاصٌ; (Yaakoob, S,<br>\
K;) or this is a word of weak authority, (K, TA,)<br>\
and you say إِجَّاصٌ and إِنجَاصٌ like as one says<br>\
إِجَّارٌ and إِنْجَارٌ: (TA:) in the dial. of the Syrians,<br>\
the إِجَّاصٌ [or إِنْجَاص or إِنجَاس accord. to common modern usage among them] is the [pear<br>\
which they formerly called] مِشْمِش and [which<br>\
others call] كُمَّثْرَي: (K:) it is of the growth of<br>\
the country of the Arabs: (AHn:) اجّاص is an<br>\
adventitious word, (S, K,) or arabicized, (Msb,)<br>\
because ج and ص do not both occur in any<br>\
Arabic word: (S, Msb, K:) or, accord. to Az,<br>\
they do so occur; as, for instance, in حَصَّصَ, and<br>\
in صَجٌّ. (TA.)<br>\
