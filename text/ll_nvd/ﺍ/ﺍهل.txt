أهّل بِهِ, (K,) or أهّلهُ, (Ham p. 184,) inf. n.<br>\
تَأْهِيلٌ, (Ham, K,) He said to him أَهْلًا: (Ham:)<br>\
or he said to him مَرْحَبًا وَأَهْلًا: (K:) like رَحَّبَ بِهِ:<br>\
(TA:) [see أَهْلٌ:] IB says that [the first pers. of]<br>\

to rule: a strange assertion]. (TA.) ―<br>\

استأهلهُ as signifying He was, or became,<br>\
worthy, or deserving, of it, or he merited it, or<br>\
he had a right, or just title or claim, to it, is not<br>\
allowable: (Msb, * MF:) not only does J disallow it, but the generality of those before him do<br>\
so; saying that it is not chaste: in the Fs it is<br>\
said to be of weak authority; and the expositors<br>\
thereof confirm this assertion, saying that it occurs,<br>\
but is inferior to other words in chasteness; and<br>\
El-Hareeree asserts it to be erroneous: (MF:) or<br>\
it is good in this sense; and J&#39;s disallowance of<br>\
it is of no account: (K:) Az and Z and Sgh and<br>\
others assert it to be good: and Az says, in the<br>\
T, some have asserted the saying فُلَانٌ يَسْتَأْهِلُ أَنْ<br>\
يُكْرَمَ أَوْ يُهَانَ, as meaning [Such a one] is worthy,<br>\
or deserving, [of being treated with honour, or of<br>\
being held in light estimation,] to be erroneous;<br>\
and الاِسْتِئْهَالُ to be only from الإِهَالَةُ; but I do<br>\
not disallow it, nor charge with error him who<br>\
says thus; for I have heard the verb thus used<br>\
by a chaste Arab of the desert, of the BenooAsad, and there was present a number of Arabs<br>\
of the desert who did not disapprove his saying:<br>\
and this is confirmed by the saying in the Kur<br>\
[lxxiv. 55], هُوَ أَهْلُ التَّقْوَي وَ أَهْلُ المَغْفِرَةِ [explained<br>\
below: see أَهْلُ]. (T.)<br>\
-A2-  استأهل, (JK, K,) or<br>\
استأهل الأَهَالَةَ, (Msb,) He took the إِهَالَةَ: (JK,<br>\
K:) or he ate the اهالة: see this word below.<br>\
(Msb, TA.)<br>\
أَهْلٌ [The people of a house or dwelling, and of<br>\
a town or village, and of a country: and the<br>\
family of a man:] a man&#39;s cohabitants of one<br>\

one family or race, and of one religion, and of<br>\
one craft or art or the like: (Er-Rághib, Kull:)<br>\
or, as some say, relations, whether they have<br>\
followers or dependents, or not; whereas آلٌ signifies relations with their followers or dependents:<br>\
(Kull:) or it originally signifies relations: and<br>\
sometimes is applied to followers or dependents:<br>\
and signifies also the أَهْل [i. e. people, or inhabitants, or family,] of a house or tent: (Msb:)<br>\
or a man&#39;s nearer, or nearest, relations by descent<br>\
from the same father or ancestor; or his kinsfolk; his relations: (K:) or, accord. to [the<br>\
Imám] Mohammad, a man&#39;s wife [or wives] and<br>\

his expenditure; and thus, any brother and sister,<br>\
or paternal uncle and son of a paternal uncle,<br>\
or strange or distantly-related child, whom a<br>\
man feeds or sustains in his abode: the most<br>\
particular, or most special, dependents, or the<br>\
like, of a man: on the authority of El-Ghooree:<br>\
(Mgh:) [J indicates some of these meanings merely<br>\
by saying that it signifies] the أَهْل of a man, and<br>\
the أَهْل of a house; as also ↓ أَهْلَةٌ: (S:) [see<br>\
also آلٌ; in the explanations of which, certain distinctions between it and أَهْلٌ will be found mentioned:] the pl. is أَهْلُونَ, [like أَرْضُونَ, a form<br>\
sometimes used for أَرَضُونَ] (Mgh, Msb, K,) and<br>\
أَهَالٍ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) with an additional ى [implied by the tenween, and expressed in the accus. case,<br>\
and when the word is determinate, as in الأَهَالِى,]<br>\
(S,) contr. to rule, (S, Mgh,) like لَيَالٍ, pl. of<br>\
لَيْلٌ, (S,) [and like أَرَاض, respecting which and<br>\
ليَالٍ and أَهَالٍ, see أَرْضٌ,] and آهَالٌ, (S, K,) a<br>\
pl. [of pauc.] sometimes occurring in poetry, (S,)<br>\

-b2-  أَهْلُ البَيْتِ The [people<br>\
or] inhabitants [or family] of the house or tent.<br>\
(Mgh, K.) But أَوْصَى لأَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ means the same<br>\
as اوصى لِجِنْسِهِ, i. e. He left by will, of his<br>\
property, to the children of his father, [or his<br>\
kindred by the father&#39;s side,] exclusively of all<br>\
relations of the mother. (Mgh in art. جنس.)<br>\

السِّيلِ إِلَى السَّهْلِ a prov. [meaning Kinsfolk are<br>\
quicker of tendency to kinsfolk than the torrent<br>\
to the plain]. (TA.) So, too, a saying of a poet<br>\
cited voce خَفْضٌ. (TA.) [And] أَهْلَكَ وَاللَّيْلَ a<br>\
prov. meaning بَادِر أَهْلَكَ وَاحْذَرِ اللَّيْلَ وَ ظُلْمَتَهُ<br>\

Thou hast come to a people who are [like] kinsfolk, and to a place that is plain, even, not<br>\

-b9-  أَهْلُ النَّبِىِّ The [family or] wives<br>\

&#39;Alee: or his women; and (as some say, TA)<br>\

in the present day, أَهْلُ بَيْتِ الرَّجُلِ;] and so,<br>\
too, ↓ أَهْلَتُهُ. (K.) Hence the phrase بَنَى عَلَي<br>\
أَهْلِهِ [see art. بنىِ]: (Kull:) and دَخَلَ بِأَهْلِهِ and<br>\
دَخَلَ عَلَى أَهْلِهِ [see art. دخل]. (Har p. 502;<br>\

as a sing. and as a pl., (K,) having a right, or<br>\
just title, to such a thing; entitled thereto;<br>\
worthy, or deserving, thereof; meet, or fit, for<br>\
it: (S, K:) the vulgar say ↓ مُسْتَأْهِلٌ, which is<br>\

of no account. (K: see 10.) You say, هُو أَهْلٌ<br>\
لِإِكْرَامِ He is entitled to be, or worthy of being,<br>\
treated with honour. (Msb.) And لِكُّلِ ↓ هُوَ أَهْلَةٌ<br>\
