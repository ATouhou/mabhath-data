أَبَى, aor. يَأْبَى, (S, M, Msb, K,) which is<br>\
anomalous, (S, M, Msb,) because it has no faucial<br>\
letter (S, Msb) for its second or third radical,<br>\
(Msb,) and يَأْبِى, (M, Msb, K,) mentioned by IJ<br>\
as sometimes said, (M,) agreeably with analogy,<br>\
(TA,) and يِئْبَى, which is doubly anomalous, first<br>\
because the pret. is of the measure فَعَلَ, and this<br>\
pronunciation of the ى of the aor. is [regularly<br>\
allowable only] in the case of a verb of the<br>\
measure فَعِلَ, aor. يَفْعَلُ, and secondly because it<br>\
is only in an aor. like يِيْجَلُ, (Sb, M,) i. e., of a<br>\
verb of which the first radical letter is و or ى,<br>\
(TA in art. وجل,) and يِئْبِى, (IB, [who cites as<br>\
an ex. a verse ending with the phrase حَتَّى تِئْبِيَهْ,])<br>\
inf. n. إِبَآءٌ (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and إِبَآءَ ةٌ, (K,)<br>\
or إِبَاةٌ, (so in a copy of the M,) or إِبَايَةٌ, (so in<br>\
the Msb,) He refused; or refrained, forbore,<br>\
abstained, or held back; syn. اِمْتَنَعَ; (S, Msb, MF,<br>\
Bd in ii. 32, Kull p. 8,) voluntarily, or of his<br>\
own free will or choice: (Bd ubi suprà, Kull:)<br>\
[thus when used intransitively: and it is also used<br>\
transitively:] you say, أَبَى الأَمْرَ he refused assent,<br>\
or consent, to the thing, or affair; disagreed to<br>\
it; and did not desire [to do] it: (Mtr in Har<br>\
p. 483:) he did not assent to, consent to, approve,<br>\
or choose, it; he disallowed it; rejected it: (Mgh:)<br>\
and أَبَي الشَّىْ ءَ he disliked, was displeased with,<br>\
disapproved of, or hated, the thing. (M, K.) Fr<br>\
says that there is no verb with fet-h to its medial<br>\
radical letter in the pret. and fut. [or aor.] unless<br>\
its second or third radical is a faucial letter, except<br>\
أَبَى: that AA adds رَكَنَ: but that one says رَكَنَ<br>\
with يَرْكُنُ for its fut., and رَكِنَ with يَرْكَنُ for<br>\
its fut.: (T:) so that the instance mentioned by<br>\
AA is one of an intermixture of two dial. vars.:<br>\
(TA:) Th adds قَلَى and غَسَا and شَجَا; and Mbr<br>\
adds جَبَا: but most of the Arabs say يَقْلِى and<br>\
يَغْسُو and يَشْجُو and يَجْبِى. (T.) [Some other<br>\
instances are mentioned by other authors; but<br>\
these are verbs of which the aors. are rarely with<br>\
fet-h, or are instances of the intermixture of two<br>\
dial. vars.] أَبَيْتَ اللَّعْنَ is a greeting which was<br>\
addressed to kings in the time of ignorance;<br>\
meaning Mayest thou refuse, or dislike, (ISk, *<br>\
S, * M, * Har p. 491,) to do a thing that would<br>\
occasion thy being cursed! (ISk, S, M;) or, to<br>\
do that for which thou wouldst deserve the being<br>\
cursed! for it implies the meaning of a prayer;<br>\
i. e., may God make thee to be of those who<br>\
dislike the being cursed! and hence it occurs<br>\
parenthetically. (Har ubi suprà.) You say also,<br>\
أَبَى أَنْ يُضَامَ [He refused, or did not submit, to<br>\
be harmed, or injured]. (T.) [And sometimes<br>\
لَا is inserted after أَنْ, and is either redundant, or<br>\
corroborative of the meaning of the verb, as in<br>\
the case of أَنَ لَا or أَلَّا after مَنَعَ.] It is said in<br>\
the Kur ix. 32, وَيَأْبَى اللّهُ إِلَّا أَنْ يُتِمَّ نَورَهُ, meaning<br>\
But God will not consent or choose [save to complete, or perfect, his light]. (Bd.) And in the<br>\
same xvii. 91, فَأَبَي أَكْثَرُ النَاسَ إِلَّا كُفُورًا, i. e.<br>\
[But the greater number of men have not consented<br>\
to, or chosen, aught] save denying [its truth, or<br>\
disbelieving it]; this phrase with إِلَّا being allowable because it is rendered by means of a negative. (Bd.) You also say, كَانَ يَأْبَى اللَّحْمَ [He<br>\
used to refuse, or dislike, flesh-meat], (K,) or<br>\
أَكْلَ اللَّحْمِ [the eating of flesh-meat]. (Mgh.)<br>\
And أَبَى فَلَانٌ المَآءِ [Such a one refused, or disliked, water, or the water]: (S:) or أَبَى مِنْ شُرْبِ<br>\
المَآءِ [he refused, or voluntarily refrained from,<br>\
the drinking of water, or the water]. (AAF, M.)<br>\
And أَبَى عَلَيْهِ الأَمَرَ, (Mgh, and Mtr. [author of the<br>\
Mgh] in Har p. 483,) and عَلَيْهِ ↓ تَأَبَّاهُ, both signify He refused him his assent, or consent, to the<br>\
thing, or affair. (Mtr ubi suprà, in Har.) Hence,<br>\
(Mtr ubi suprà,) أَبَى عَلَيْهِ, (Mgh, and Mtr ubi<br>\
suprà,) and عَلَيْهِ ↓ تَأَبَّى, (T, S, and Mtr ubi suprà,)<br>\
He was incompliant, or unyielding, to him; he<br>\
resisted him, withstood him, or repugned him;<br>\
syn. اِمْتَنَعَ (T, S, Mgh, and Mtr ubi suprà) عَلَيْهِ:<br>\
(T:) thus explained because the objective complement (الأَمْرَ) is suppressed. (Mtr ubi suprà.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
أَبِيْتُ الطَّعَامَ, (K,) or مِنَ الطَّعَامِ, and اللَّبَنِ, (M,<br>\
TA, [in a copy of the former of which the verb is<br>\
written ابَيْتُ, but this I suppose to be a mistranscription, on account of what here follows,]) like<br>\
رَضِيْتُ, (K,) inf. n. أَبَّى, (M, and so in some<br>\
copies of the K,) or إِبَّى, (so in some copies of the<br>\
K,) with kesr, and with the short final alif, (TA,<br>\
[i.e. like رِضَّى, but perhaps this may have been<br>\
supposed to be the right reading only because the<br>\
verb is likened to رَضِيتُ, of which رِضَّى is the<br>\
most common inf. n.,]) I left, or relinquished, the<br>\
food, (M, K,) and the milk, (M, TA,) without<br>\
being satiated, or satisfied. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَبِىَ الفَصِيلُ,<br>\
and أُبِىَ, inf. n. أَبَّى, The young camel, or young<br>\
weaned camel, suffered indigestion from the milk,<br>\
and became affected with a dislike of food. (M,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A3-  أَبَيْتُ as syn. with أَبَوْتُ: see the latter.<br>\
4<br>\
آبَيْتُهُ إِيَّاهُ [in the CK, erroneously, أَبَيْتُهُ] I<br>\
made him to refuse it; or to refrain, forbear,<br>\
abstain, or hold back, from it, voluntarily, or<br>\
of his own free will or choice: (S: [this meaning<br>\
being there implied, though not expressed:]) or<br>\
I made him to dislike it, to be displeased with it,<br>\
to disapprove of it, or to hate it: (M, K:) namely,<br>\
water [&amp;c.]. (S, M.) One says, فُلَانٌ بَحْرٌ لَا بُؤْبِى,<br>\
(ISk, S, K, * [in the CK, erroneously, لا يُؤْبى,])<br>\
i. e., لَا يَجْعَلُكَ تَأْبَاهُ [Such a one is like a sea, or<br>\
great river, that will not make thee to refuse it,<br>\
or dislike it, &amp;c.]; (K;) i. e., that will not fail,<br>\
or come to an end, (ISk, S, K,) by reason of its<br>\
abundance. (ISk, S.) In like manner one says,<br>\
of any water, مَآءٌ لَا يُؤْبِى [Water that will not<br>\
fail, or come to an end]. (TA.) And عِنْدَنَا مَآءٌ مَا<br>\
يُؤْبِى With us, or at our abode, is water that does<br>\
not become scanty, or little in quantity. (Lh, T,<br>\
M.) And آبَى المَآءُ The water decreased, or became deficient. (AA, from El-Mufaddal.) And<br>\
قَلِيبٌ لَا يُؤْبِى A well that will not become exhausted: (IAar, M:) one should not say, يُؤْبَى.<br>\
(M, TA.) In like manner, also, one says, كَلَأَ<br>\
لَا يُؤْبَى Herbage, or pasture, that will not fail, or<br>\
come to an end. (S.) And عِنْدَهُ دَرَاهِمُ لَا تُؤْبِى<br>\
He has dirhems, or money, that will not fail, or<br>\
come to an end. (TA.) And آبَى المَآءُ signifies<br>\
also The water [in a well] was, or became, difficult of access (اِمْتَنَعَ), so that no one was able to<br>\
descend to it but by exposing himself to peril or<br>\
destruction: (M:) if a drawer of water descend<br>\
into the well, (T, TA,) and the water be altered<br>\
for the worse in odour, (TA,) he expose himself<br>\
to peril, or destruction. (T, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَأَبَّى عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرَ: and تأبّى عَلَيْهِ alone: see 1,<br>\
latter half of the paragraph.<br>\
إِبْيَةٌ A paucity, or deficiency, and revulsion, of<br>\
the milk in the breast: (Fr, TS:) or a revulsion<br>\
of the milk in the udder; (K;) but the saying<br>\
“in the udder” requires consideration. (TA:)<br>\
You say to a woman, when she has a fever on the<br>\
occasion of childbirth, إِنَّمَا هذِهِ الحُمَّى إِبْيَةٌ ثَدْيِكَ<br>\
[This fever is only occasioned by the paucity, or<br>\
deficiency, and revulsion, of the milk in thy breast.]<br>\

measure فُعَالٌ, (S, M,) with damm, (S, K,) because it is like a disease, and nouns significant of<br>\
diseases are generally of that measure. (M.) You<br>\
say, أَخَذَهُ أُبَآءٌ (T, S, M, K) مِنَ الطَّعَامِ (K) He<br>\
was, or became, taken, or affected, with a dislike,<br>\
or loathing, of food. (T, S, M, K.)<br>\

back [voluntarily, or of his own free will or<br>\
choice]: (S, Msb, TA: *) [refusing assent or consent; &amp;c.:] disliking, being displeased with a thing,<br>\
disapproving of it, or hating it: (M, * K, * TA:)<br>\
or the first and second, a man disliking, or loathing, food: (M, K, TA:) and the third, (K,) and<br>\
↓ أَبْيَانٌ, (so in a copy of the M,) or أبَيَانٌ, (K,) a<br>\

having vehement ابآء [app. أُبَآء, i. e. dislike, or<br>\
loathing, of food; agreeably with a common<br>\
quality of words of the measure فَعْلَان]: (T, TA:<br>\
[but in copy of the T, accord. to the TT, ابآء<br>\
in this last explanation is written اِبآء: in the TA<br>\
it is without any vowel-sign:]) the pl. of آبٍ is<br>\
آبُونَ and أُبَاةٌ (M, K) and أُبِىٌّ, (K,) with damm,<br>\
then kesr, and then teshdeed, (TA, [in the CK<br>\
اُبَىّ, and in a copy of the M اُبِين,]) and أُبَّآءٌ, (M,<br>\

CK اُباء:]) the pl. of ↓ أَبِىٌّ is أَبِيُّونَ; (M, K;) of<br>\
which an instance occurs wherein the pl. ن is<br>\
likened to a radical ن; the gen. case being<br>\
written, at the end of a verse, أَبيِينِ: (M:) the<br>\
pl. of ↓ أَبْيَانٌ, (M,) or أَبَيَانٌ, (K,) is إِبْيَانٌ. (Kr,<br>\
