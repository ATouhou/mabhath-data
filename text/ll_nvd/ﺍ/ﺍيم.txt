آمَتْ, (T, M, Mgh, K,) aor. تَئِيمُ, (T, K,)<br>\
inf. n. أَيْمَةٌ, (T, M, Mgh, K,) or this is a simple<br>\
subst., (Msb,) and إِيمَةٌ and أَيْمٌ and أُيُومٌ, (M,<br>\
K,) She had no husband; said of a virgin and<br>\
of one who is not a virgin; (IAar, T, M, Mgh,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ تأيّمت (Lth, T, M) and ↓ ائتامت:<br>\
(M:) or, as some say, ↓ تأيّمت signifies she lost<br>\
her husband by his death, she being still fit for<br>\
husbands, having in her a remaining force of<br>\
youth: (T:) and you say, آمَتْ مِنْ زَوْجِهَا, aor.<br>\
تَئِيمُ, inf. n. أَيْمَةٌ and أَيْمٌ and أُيُومٌ, (S, TA,<br>\
[accord. to the former app. signifying the same<br>\
as آمَتْ alone as explained above: or]) meaning<br>\
she became bereft of her husband by his death,<br>\
or by his being slain, and remained without<br>\
marrying. (TA.) And آمَ, (T, S, Msb,) aor.<br>\
يَئِيمُ, (T, Msb,) inf. n. أَيْمَةٌ, (T,) He had no<br>\
wife: (T, Msb:) or he lost his wife by her<br>\
death: (S, * K, * and Ham p. 650:) and he did<br>\

It is said of the Prophet, in a trad., كَانَ يَتَعَوَّذُ<br>\
مِنَ الأَيْمَةِ (T, S) He used to pray for preservation<br>\
from remaining long without a wife. (T.) And<br>\
Yezeed Ibn-El-Hakam Eth-Thakafee says,<br>\
كُلُّ امْرِىءٍ سَتَئِيمُ مِنْهُ العِرْسُ أَوْمِنْهَا يَئِيمُ<br>\
(S) i. e. Every man, the wife will be bereft of<br>\
him by his death, or he will be bereft of her<br>\
by her death. (Ham p. 531.) One says also,<br>\
مَا لَهُ آمَ وَعَامَ, meaning [What aileth him?] May<br>\
his wife and his cattle die, or perish, so that he<br>\
shall have no wife (حَتَّى يَئيِمَ) and be vehemently<br>\
desirous of milk (يَعِيمَ). (S, K: [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, امٌ و عامٌ; and in a MS. copy of the<br>\
K آمٌ ولاعامٌ.])<br>\

أَيَّمَهُ اللّٰهُ inf. n. تَأْيِيمٌ, God made him to have<br>\
no wife. (K, * TK.) And أَيَّمْتُ المَرْأَةَ, inf. n. as<br>\

أَعَمْتُهَا; (T, S;) I made the woman to be a<br>\
widow, by slaying her husband. (T, * S, and<br>\
Ham ubi suprà.) Taäbata-sharrà says,<br>\
فَأَيَّمْتُ نِسْوَانًا وَأَيْتَمْتُ إِلْدَةً<br>\
[And I have made women widows, by slaying<br>\
their husbands; and children fatherless]. (TA.)<br>\

تأيّم: see 1, in three places.<br>\
The former is also explained as signifying She<br>\
became forlorn (تَحَوَّشَتْ) of her husband. (K in<br>\
art. حوش.) And also, (TA,) or تَأَيَّمَتْ زَمَانًا,<br>\

termed أَيِّم [without a husband]. (M, K.)<br>\
أَيْمَ is a contraction of أَىُّ مَا, meaning أَىُّ شَىْءٍ:<br>\
it is thus in the saying, أَيْمَ هُوَيَا فُلَانُ [What<br>\
thing is it, O such a one?]: and أَيْمَ تَقُولُ [What<br>\
thing sayest thou?]. (TA.)<br>\

اللّٰهِ]: see in art. يمن. (K.)<br>\

أَيْمَانُ A man whose wife has died: and أَيْمَى<br>\
A woman whose husband has died: pl. أَيَامَى,<br>\
of both; like as سَكَارَي is pl. of سَكْرَانُ: accord.<br>\
to ISk, أَيَامَى is originally أَيَائِمُ. (Msb.) [See<br>\
also أَيِّمٌ.] أَيْمَانُ عَيْمَانُ are epithets applied to a<br>\
man, (M, K, TA,) meaning Whose wife [and<br>\
cattle] have died or perished [so that he has no<br>\
wife and is vehemently desirous of milk; as shown<br>\
above; see 1, last signification]: (TA:) the<br>\
former relates to wives; and the latter, to milk:<br>\
(S, K, TA:) fem. أَيْمَى عَيْمَى, applied to a<br>\
woman. (M, K.)<br>\
أَيِّمٌ A woman having no husband; (Lth, T, S,<br>\
M, Mgh, Msb, K;) whether she be a virgin or<br>\
not; (IAar, T, S, M, Mgh, K;) or whether she<br>\
have married before or not; (Sgh, Msb;) as<br>\
also أَيِّمَةٌ; (Msb;) [said to be] applied to one<br>\
who has not married: (IAar, T:) or if not a<br>\
virgin; accord. to [the Imám] Mohammad;<br>\
agreeably with a reading of a trad. by which the<br>\
أَيِّم is distinguished from the virgin: (Mgh:)<br>\
also, the former, a man having no wife; (S, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) whether he have married before<br>\
or not: (S, Sgh, K:) or who has not married:<br>\
(IAar, T:) pl. أَيَامَى (S, M, K) and أَيَائِمُ; (M,<br>\
K;) the latter of which is the original form:<br>\
(S, M:) [or both, accord. to the Msb, are pls.<br>\
of أَيْمَانُ, q. v.:] and أَيِّمُونَ is a pl. applied to<br>\
men, and أَيِّمَاتٌ applied to women: and آمَةٌ, also,<br>\
signifying men having no wives, is pl. of ↓ آئِمٌ for<br>\
أَيِّمٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A free woman: (K:) pl.,<br>\
in this sense also, أَيَامَى, used in this sense in<br>\
the Kur xxiv. 32, (T, TA,) accord. to some.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A female relation; (K;) in which<br>\
sense also أَيَامَى is pl.; (T, TA;) meaning such<br>\
as the daughter and the sister and the maternal<br>\
aunt. (T, K.)<br>\
