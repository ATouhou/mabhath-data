آلَ, aor. يَؤُولُ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) inf. n. أَوْلٌ<br>\
(T, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and مَآلٌ (M, K) and<br>\
إِيَالٌ, which last is used as a subst. in relation to<br>\
objects of the mind, (Msb,) and أَيْلُولَةٌ [like<br>\
دَيْمُومَةٌ], (TA,) He, or it, returned; syn. رَجَعَ;<br>\
(T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) and عَادَ; (T;) [and<br>\
he resorted; (see an instance voce إِيَّلٌ;)] إِلَيْهِ to<br>\
it; (M, K;) namely a thing [of any kind; the thing,<br>\
or place, whence he, or it, originated, or came; his,<br>\
or its, origin, or source; his, or its, original state,<br>\
condition, quantity, weight, &amp;c.; any place; and<br>\
a former action, or saying, or the like: see رَجَعَ,<br>\
by which, as the explanation of آلَ, may be meant<br>\
to be implied some other significations, here following, which these two verbs have in common]:<br>\
(M:) and آلَ عَنْهُ he (a man, M) returned,<br>\
or reverted, from it. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  From آلَ as<br>\
syn. with رَجَعَ is the phrase, فُلَانٌ يَؤُولُ إِلَى كَرَمٍ<br>\
[meaning either Such a one returns to generosity,<br>\
or, as كَرَمٌ is used in the sense of كِرَامٌ, is<br>\
referable to generous, or noble, ancestors]. (TA.)<br>\
[And hence the phrase,] آلَ إِلَيْهِ بِنَسَبٍ [He bore<br>\
a relation to him, as a member to a head, by<br>\
kindred], and بِدِينٍ [by religion]. (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh.)<br>\
And the saying, in a trad., مَنْ صَامَ الدَّهْرَ فَلَا<br>\
صَامَ وَ لَا آلَ, i. e. (tropical:)  [He who fasts ever, or always,<br>\
may he neither fast] nor return to what is good.<br>\
(TA.) [In the Mgh, art. دهر, for آل I find أَفْطَرَ;<br>\
and it is there said that this is an imprecation<br>\
uttered by the Prophet, lest a man should believe<br>\
this kind of fasting to be ordained by God; or,<br>\
through impotence, should become insincere; or<br>\
because, by fasting all the days of the year, he<br>\
would do so on the days on which fasting is<br>\
forbidden. See other readings voce أَلَا in art.<br>\
الو.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence also the saying, آلتِ الضَّرْبَهُ إِلَى<br>\
النَّفْسِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  The blow, or stroke, resulted<br>\
in destroying life; in slaying, or killing. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Hence also, آلَ الأَمْرُ إِلَى كَذَا [The affair,<br>\
or case, became ultimately reduced to such a state,<br>\
or condition; came to such a result; came to<br>\
be thus]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Hence also, طَبَخْتُ الشَّرَابَ<br>\
فَآلَ إِلَى قَدْرِ كَذَا I cooked the wine, or beverage,<br>\
and it became reduced (رَجَعَ) to such a quantity.<br>\
(S.) And طَبَخَهُ حَتَّى آلَ إِلَى الثُّلُثِ أَوِالرُّبعِ He<br>\
cooked it (namely نَبِيذ [i. e. must, or mead, or<br>\
wort,]) until it became reduced (رَجَعَ) to the<br>\
third, or to the fourth: (T:) or, said of the<br>\
same, (Mgh,) or of medicine, (TA,) حَتَّى آلَ<br>\
المَنَّانِ مَنَّا وَاحِدًا, (Mgh,) or إِلَى مَنٍّ وَاحِدٍ, (TA,)<br>\
until twice the quantity, or weight, of a مَنّ<br>\
became [reduced to] (صَارَ) one مَنّ. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
[Hence also, مَجَازُ الأَوْلِ The proleptic, or anticipative, trope; as فَصِيلٌ applied to “a young<br>\
camel” before it is weaned, because it is to be<br>\
weaned.] ―<br>\
-b7-  [And hence also, app.,] آلَ الشَّىْءُ,<br>\
inf. n. مَآلٌ, The thing [became reduced in quantity or size;] decreased; diminished; or became<br>\
defective, or deficient. (M, K.) And آلَ لَحْمُ<br>\
النَّاقَةِ The flesh of the she-camel went away, so<br>\
that she became lean, or slender and lean, or lean<br>\
and lank in the belly. (T, K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  آلَ, (T, S, M,<br>\
K,) inf. n. أَوْلٌ (T, M, K) and إِيَالٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
is also said of tar, (T, S, M,) and of honey, (S,)<br>\
and of milk, (M,) and of wine, or beverage,<br>\
(TA,) and of urine, (M,) or of the urine of<br>\
camels that have been contented with green pasture instead of water, at the end of their being in<br>\
that state, (T,) and of oil, (M, K,) and other things,<br>\
(K,) as meaning It became thick: (T, S, M, K:)<br>\
said of milk, it thickened and coagulated: (M:)<br>\
said of wine, or beverage, it thickened, and<br>\
became intoxicating in its utmost degree: (Az,<br>\
TA:) and said of oil, it attained its full perfume,<br>\
or sweetness of odour, by being well prepared<br>\
or compounded. (T.) ―<br>\
-b9-  مَا لَكَ تَؤُولُ إِلَى كَتِفَيْكَ<br>\
[written in the TA without any vowel-signs, app.<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  What aileth thee that thou shruggest<br>\
thy shoulders? lit., drawest thyself together to<br>\
thy two shoulder-blades?] is said [to a man] إِذَا<br>\
انْضَمَّ إِلَيْهِمَا وَاجْتَمَعَ [when he draws himself together to them, and contracts himself]; and is<br>\
a tropical phrase: so says Z. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  آلَ مِنْ<br>\
فُلَانٍ He escaped, or became safe or secure, from<br>\
such a one: a dial. var. of وَأَلَ: (T, K:) of the<br>\
dial. of the Ansár. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  You say also, آلَ,<br>\
aor. يَؤُولُ; (T, Msb;) or أَوِلَ, aor. يَأْوَلُ; (K;)<br>\
meaning He, or it, preceded; went before; was,<br>\
or became, before, beforehand, first, or foremost;<br>\
(T, Msb, K;) and came: (Msb:) with this, also,<br>\
وَأَلَ is syn.; and from it [says Az] is most probably derived أَوَّلُ, so that its original form is أَأْوَلُ:<br>\
[or, as Fei says,] hence is derived the phrase,<br>\
used by the vulgar, العَشْرُ الأَوَّلُ with fet-h to the<br>\
hemzeh [as meaning “the first, or preceding, ten<br>\
(nights of the month),” for الأُوَلُ, pl. of الأُولَى,<br>\
fem. of الأَوَّلُ; but this is generally regarded as<br>\
being originally الأَوْأَلُ, from وَأَلَ]. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
آلَهُ: see 2. ―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to Lth, (TA,) أُلْتُهُ, (M,<br>\
K,) aor. أَؤُولُهُ, inf. n. أَوْلٌ, (TA,) signifies I<br>\
made it (namely, milk, M, or oil &amp;c., K) to<br>\
thicken, (M, K,) and to coagulate; (M;) the<br>\
verb being both intrans. and trans.: (K:) but<br>\
Az says that it is not known as trans., in this<br>\
sense, in the language of the Arabs [of the classical ages]. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  آلَ رَعِيّتَهُ, (S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
aor. يُؤُولُ, inf. n. أَوْلٌ (S) and إِيَالٌ, (S, M, K,)<br>\
of which the simple subst. is إِيَالَةٌ, (S, * Msb,)<br>\
He (a prince or commander, S, or a king, M, K)<br>\
ruled, or governed, his subjects; presided over<br>\
their affairs, as commander or governor; (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K;) and did so well: (S:) and آلَ عَلَيْهِمْ,<br>\
inf. n. أَوْلٌ and إِيَالٌ and إِيَالَةٌ, [or this last, as<br>\
said above, is a simple subst.,] he presided over<br>\
them; held command, or authority, over them;<br>\
(M, K;) namely, a people, or company of men;<br>\
(K;) or, over their affairs. (TA.) It is said<br>\
in a prov., (M,) قَدْ أُلْنَا وَإِيلَ عَلَيْنَا (T, S, M) We<br>\
have ruled and been ruled; (T;) we have presided and been presided over. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  آلَ مَالهُ,<br>\
(T, S, M, * Msb, K,) inf. n. إِيَالَةٌ, (T, Msb,) He<br>\
put into a good, or right, state, or condition, and<br>\
managed, or tended, his مال [meaning cattle];<br>\
(T, S, M, * K;) as also ↓ ائتالهُ [written with the<br>\
disjunctive alif اِيتَالَهُ], (K,) inf. n. اِيتِيَالٌ: (S:)<br>\
or he managed his camels, and his sheep or goats,<br>\
in such a manner that they throve, or became<br>\
in a good state or condition, by his management.<br>\
(Msb.) Lebeed describes a female singer<br>\
إِبْهَامُهَا ↓ بِمُوَتَّرٍتَأْتَالُهُ<br>\
(T, S,) meaning with a stringed lute, (EM<br>\
p. 169,) which her thumb adjusts; (S, EM;)<br>\
from أُلْتُ, (T, S,) signifying I put into a good,<br>\
right, or proper, state, or condition. (T. [But<br>\
see another reading in the first paragraph of art.<br>\
اوي.]) You say also, أُلْتُ الشَّىْءَ meaning I composed, or collected together, the thing, and put<br>\
it into a good, right, or proper, state, or condition: and some of the Arabs say, اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ ↓ أَوَّلَ<br>\
أَمْرَكَ, i. e. May God compose for thee thine<br>\
affair: and, by way of imprecation, اللّٰهُ ↓ لَا أَوَّلَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ شَمْلَهُ [May God not compose for him his<br>\
discomposed, disorganized, deranged, or unsettled,<br>\
affair, or affairs]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أُلْتُ الإِبلَ, inf. n.<br>\
أَوْلٌ and إِيَالٌ, also signifies I drove the camels:<br>\
(M:) or, accord. to the T, I bound the camels&#39;<br>\
udders with the أَصِرَّة (صَرَرْتُهَا) until the time of<br>\
milking, when I loosed them. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
أوّلهُ إِلَيْهِ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَأْوِيلٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
returned it (namely, a thing, M) to him, or it;<br>\
he made it, or caused it, to return to him, or it;<br>\
syn. رَجَعَهُ: (M, K: in the CK رَجَّعَهُ:) and ↓ آلَهُ<br>\
also signifies the same; syn. رَدَّهُ. (TA.) You<br>\
say, أَوَّلَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْكَ ضَالَّتَكَ May God restore to<br>\
thee thy stray; (T, * TA;) cause it to return to<br>\
thee; (TA;) bring together thee and it. (T.)<br>\
And أَوَّلْتُهُ إِلَى كَذَا I caused him, or it, to come<br>\
to such a state or condition; brought, or reduced,<br>\
him, or it, thereto; syn. صَيَّرْتُهُ إِلَيْهِ. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also 1, near the end of the paragraph, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b3-  تَأْوِيلٌ also signifies The discovering,<br>\
detecting, revealing, developing, or disclosing, or<br>\
the explaining, expounding, or interpreting, that<br>\
to which a thing is, or may be, reduced, or that<br>\
which it comes, or may come, to be: (S, O, TA:)<br>\
you say, أَوَّلْتُهُ, inf. n. تَأْوِيلٌ; and ↓ تَأَوَّلْتُهُ, inf. n.<br>\
تَأَوُّلٌ; in one and the same sense: and hence the<br>\
saying of El-Aashà:<br>\
حُبِّهَا ↓ عَلَى أَنَّهَا كَانَتْ تَأَوُّلُ<br>\
رِبْعِىِّ السِّقَابِ فَأَصْحَبَا ↓ تَأَوُّلَ<br>\
(S:) or حُبَّها ↓ تاوَّل: (so in a copy of the T: [the<br>\
former word being, accord. to this reading, a<br>\
contraction of تَتَأَوَّلُ; but this does not altogether<br>\
agree with what here follows:]) AO says, تَأَوُّلُ حُبِّهَا<br>\
means تَفْسِيرُهُ وَمَرْجِعُهُ: [i. e., the explanation of<br>\
her love, or of the (poet&#39;s) love of her, and the<br>\
state, or condition, to which it eventually came,<br>\
is this:] (S:) it was small in his heart, and<br>\
ceased not to grow until it became great; like as<br>\
the little young camel [born in the season called<br>\
ربيع, or in the beginning of the breeding-time,]<br>\
ceases not to grow until he becomes great like his<br>\
mother, (T, * S,) and has a son accompanying<br>\
him: (S:) [or] أوّلهُ and ↓ تأوّلهُ, (M, K,) inf. n.<br>\
of the former as above, (K,) when said of language, signify دَبَّرَهُ وَقَدَّرَهُ وَفَسَّرَهُ [he considered its<br>\
end, or what it might be to which it led or pointed,<br>\
and compared one part of it with another, and<br>\
then explained, or expounded, or interpreted, it]:<br>\
(M, K:) hence, [if the explanation in the M and<br>\
K be meant to denote three distinct meanings,<br>\
which I do not think to be the case,] it would<br>\
seem as though تَأْوِيلٌ and تَفْسِيرٌ were syn.; but<br>\
accord. to other authorities, they differ: (TA:)<br>\
[Az says,] accord. to Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà, these<br>\
two words and مَعْنًى are all one: but تأويل seems<br>\
to me to signify the collecting the meanings of<br>\
dubious expressions by such expression as is clear,<br>\
or plain, without dubiousness: or, accord. to Lth,<br>\
it is the interpreting of language that has different<br>\
meanings; and this cannot be rightly done but by<br>\
an explanation which changes the expression; as<br>\
also ↓ تأَوُّلٌ: (T:) or the turning a verse of the<br>\
Kur-án from its apparent meaning to a meaning<br>\
which it bears, or admits, when the latter is<br>\
agreeable with the Scripture and the Sunneh: for<br>\
instance, in the words of the Kur [vi. 95, &amp;c.],<br>\
يُخْرِجُ الْحَىَّ مِنَ المَيِّتِ, if the meaning be [thus<br>\
explained] “He produceth the bird from the egg,”<br>\
this is تفسير: and if [it be explained as meaning]<br>\
“He produceth the believer from the unbeliever,”<br>\
or “the knowing from the ignorant,” this is<br>\
تأويل: so says Ibn-El-Kemál: (TA:) [hence,<br>\
although it may often be rendered by interpretation, like تفسير, it more properly signifies the<br>\
rendering in a manner not according to the letter,<br>\
or overt sense; explaining the covert, or virtual,<br>\
meaning; interpreting in a manner not according<br>\
to the obvious meaning:] or the reducing a thing<br>\
to its ultimate intent, whether it be a saying or<br>\
an action: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or تفسير signifies<br>\
the “discovering, detecting, revealing, or disclosing, what is meant by a dubious expression;”<br>\
and تأويل, the reducing one of two senses, or<br>\
interpretations, which an expression bears, or<br>\
admits, to that which suits the apparent meaning:<br>\
(L and K in art. فسر, and TA in that and in the<br>\
present art.:) or the former signifies the “expounding, explaining, or interpreting, the narratives which occur collected without discrimination<br>\
in the Kur-án, and making known the significations of the strange words or expressions, and<br>\
explaining the occasions on which the verses were<br>\
revealed;” and the latter, the explaining the<br>\
meaning of that which is مُتَشَابِهِ, [or what is<br>\
equivocal, or ambiguous,] i. e., what is not understood without repeated consideration. (TA: [in<br>\
which are some further explanations; but these<br>\
add nothing of importance.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence, أوّل لَفْظًا,<br>\
in grammar, He rendered a word, or an expression, or a phrase, in grammatical analysis, by<br>\
another word, or expression, or phrase.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
[hence likewise,] تَأْوِيلٌ signifies also The interpretation, or explanation, of a dream; the telling the<br>\
final sequel, or result, thereof: (M, K:) as in<br>\
the Kur xii. 101. (M.) ―<br>\
-b6-  It is also used [as a<br>\
simple subst.] to signify The end, issue, result, or<br>\
final sequel, of a thing; syn. عَاقِبَةٌ; (Bd in iv. 62<br>\
and xvii. 37;) or ↓ مَآلٌ; (Jel in the same places;)<br>\
or مَرْجِعٌ, and مَصِيرٌ; as in the Kur [iii. 5], وَمَا<br>\
يعْلَمُ تَأْوِيلَهُ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ [But none knoweth the end,<br>\
&amp;c., thereof, except God]: (A&#39;Obeyd, T:) or<br>\
this phrase means, but none knoweth when will be<br>\
the resurrection, and to what the case will eventually come, (T, M,) when the hour shall arrive,<br>\
(TA,) except God: (T, M:) so says Aboo-Is-hák:<br>\
(T:) and in like manner, [in the Kur vii. 51,]<br>\
هَلْ يَنْظُرُونَ إِلَّا تَأْوِيلَهُ means Do they wait for<br>\
aught save the result to which their case will come<br>\
by the resurrection? (Aboo-Is-hák, T, M:) or,<br>\
the result to which it will come (Bd, Jel) in the<br>\
manifestation of its truth by the appearance of<br>\
the promises and threats of which it has told?<br>\
(Bd:) in like manner, also, the saying, تَقْوي اللّٰهِ<br>\
أَحْسَنُ تَأْوِيلًا means The fear of God is best in<br>\
respect of result; syn. عَاقِبَةً. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَاَوَّلَ see 2, in the former half of the paragraph,<br>\
in six places. ―<br>\
-b2-  تأوّل فِيهِ الخَيْرَ He discovered in<br>\
him the existence of good, or goodness, from its<br>\
outward signs: and he sought, or looked for,<br>\
good, or goodness, in him. (TA.) You say also,<br>\
تَأَوَّلْتُ فِى فُلَانٍ الأَجْرَ I sought, or looked for,<br>\
recompense in (or of or from) such a one. (T.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِاْتَوَلَ see 1, near the end of the paragraph, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
10<br>\
استآل الرُّؤْيَا He sought the interpretation of<br>\
the dream, by consideration. (TA in art. سوأ.)<br>\
آلٌ A man&#39;s أَهْل [or family]; (T, S, M, Msb,<br>\
K;) i. e. his relations: (Msb:) his عَشِيرَة [or<br>\
kinsfolk; or nearer, or nearest, relations by<br>\
descent from the same father or ancestor; &amp;c.];<br>\
from أَوْلٌ as signifying رُجُوعٌ, because recourse is<br>\
had to them in all affairs: (Har p. 578:) and his<br>\
household; (S, TA;) the people of his house:<br>\
(Msb:) and his followers; (S, Msb, K;) including soldiers: (S, TA:) and his أَوْلِيَآء [i. e.<br>\
friends, and the like]: (K:) those who bear a<br>\
relation to him, as members to a head, (مَنْ آلَ إِلَيْهِ,)<br>\
by religion or persuasion or kindred; as in the<br>\
Kur iii. 9 and viii. 54 and 56 &amp;c.: (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh:)<br>\
[or in these and many other instances, it may be<br>\
rendered people:] but in general it is not used<br>\
save in relation to that in which is eminence, or<br>\
nobility; so that one does not say, آلُ الإِسْكَافِ,<br>\
like as one says أَهْلُهُ: (K:) and it is peculiarly<br>\
used as a prefix to the proper names of rational<br>\
beings; not to indeterminate nouns, nor to nouns<br>\
of places or of times; so that one says, آلُ فُلَانٍ;<br>\
but not آلُ رَجُلٍ, nor آلُ زَمَانِ كَذَا, nor آلُ مَوْضَعِ<br>\
كَذَا, like as one says, [أَهْلُ رَجُلٍ, and أَهْلُ زَمَانِ<br>\
كَذَا, and] أَهْلُ بَلَدِ كَذَا and مَوْضِعِ كَذَا: (TA:)<br>\
Ks disallows its being prefixed to a pronoun; so<br>\
that one should not say, آلُهُ, but أَهْلُهُ; but his<br>\
opinion in this matter is not correct: it is originally أَوَلٌ; the و being changed into ا, (M, *<br>\
Msb,) as in قَالَ [which is originally قَوَلَ]: so<br>\
say some: (Msb:) or it is originally أَهْلٌ, (T,<br>\
M, Msb, K,) then أَأْلٌ, and then آلٌ: (K:) so say<br>\
some, arguing thus from its having أُهَيْلٌ for its<br>\
dim.: (T, Msb:) but accord. to Ks, it assumes<br>\
the form ↓ أُوَيْلٌ as a dim.: (T:) or each of these<br>\
is its dim. (M, K.) By the آل of the Prophet<br>\
are meant, accord. to some persons, His followers,<br>\
whether relations or others: and his relations,<br>\
whether followers or not: (Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà,<br>\
T:) or, as some say, his family (أَهْلُهُ [q. v.]) and<br>\
his wives: [but it seems to be indicated that what<br>\
I have rendered “and his wives” is meant as an<br>\
explicative adjunct to اهله:] or, as some say, the<br>\
people of his religion: (Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, T:) being<br>\
himself asked who were his آل, he answered all<br>\
pious persons: (Anas, TA:) but in a trad. in<br>\
which it is said that the poor-rates are prohibited<br>\
to him and to his آل, by this is meant those to<br>\
whom was appropriated the fifth [of the spoils]<br>\
instead of the poor-rates; and these were the<br>\
genuine descendants of Háshim and El-Muttalib.<br>\
(Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  يَا لَزَيْدٍ and يَالَ زَيْدٍ, accord.<br>\
to the Koofees, are contractions of يَا آلَ زَيْدٍ [O<br>\
family of Zeyd]. (Mughnee, on the letter ل;<br>\
and El-Ashmoonee on the Alfeeyeh of Ibn-Málik,<br>\
section الاستغاثة. [See the letter ل.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  [See<br>\
also إِيلَةٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  (tropical:)  I. q. شَخْصٌ [meaning The body,<br>\
or corporeal form or figure or substance, (of anything, as is said in the T,) which one sees from a<br>\
distance; or, in this case, often, though not always,<br>\
the person, or self]; (AA, T, S, M, K;) of a<br>\
man: a metaphorical application, from آلٌ as<br>\
signifying أَهْلٌ and عَشِيرَةٌ; because comprising<br>\
the members and the senses. (Har p. 578.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Sometimes, it is redundant, or pleonastic; [being<br>\
only used for the sake of metre in verse, or to<br>\
give more force to an expression;] as in the<br>\
following instance:<br>\
أُلَاقِى مِنْ تَذَكُّرِ آلِ لَيْلَى<br>\
كَمَا يَلْقَى السَّلِيمُ مِنَ العِدَادِ<br>\
[I experience, from remembrance of Leylà, or of<br>\
Leylà&#39;s person or self, the like of what the person<br>\
bitten or stung by a venomous reptile experiences<br>\
from the paroxysm of pain occasioned by the bits<br>\
or sting]. (TA.) [See also another ex., voce<br>\
جَأْبٌ; and another, voce مِزْمَارٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [Like شَخْصٌ,<br>\
it seems to be sometimes applied to Any material<br>\
thing that is somewhat high, and conspicuous:<br>\
and hence, perhaps, the signification next following.] ―<br>\
-b4-  مَا أَشْرَفَ مِنَ البَعِيرِ [app. meaning The<br>\
overtopping, or higher, part, or parts, of the<br>\
camel]. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  A [tent of the kind called]<br>\
خَيْمَة. (M.) ―<br>\
-b6-  The poles of the خَيْمَة; (M, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ آلَةٌ; of which the pl. is آلاتٌ: (K:) or<br>\
↓ آلَةٌ is the sing. of آلٌ and آلَاتٌ, [or n. un. of the<br>\
former and pl. of the latter,] which signify the<br>\
pieces of wood (خَشَبَات) upon which the خيمة is<br>\
raised, or constructed: and hence Kutheiyir<br>\
likens the legs of his she-camel to four آلات of<br>\
the [wood of the tree called] طَلْح. (S.) ―<br>\
-b7-  The<br>\
pieces of wood (خَشَب, T, M, K) of خَيْم [or tents],<br>\
(M,) stripped [of the tent-cloths]. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
Also, [app. because rising from the general surface of the ground,] The extremities and sides of<br>\
a mountain. (M, K. *)<br>\
-A3-  The سَرَاب [or mirage]:<br>\
(As, T, M, K:) or peculiarly applied to that which<br>\
is in the first part of the day, (K,) as though<br>\
raising figures seen from a distance (شُخُوص),<br>\
and making them to quiver: (TA:) or that<br>\
which one sees in the first part of the day, and in<br>\
the last part thereof, as though raising figures<br>\
seen from a distance (شخوص); not the same as<br>\
the سراب: (S:) or what resembles the سراب:<br>\
(Msb:) or, as some say, that which is in the<br>\
ضُحَى [or early part of the day when the sun is<br>\
yet low], like water between the sky and the earth,<br>\
[in appearance] raising figures seen from a distance (شخوص), and making them to quiver;<br>\
whereas the سراب is that which is at mid-day,<br>\
[apparently] cleaving to the ground, as though<br>\
it were running water: Th says, the آل is in the<br>\
first part of the day: (M:) As says that the آل<br>\
and the سراب are one: but others say that the<br>\
former is from the ضُحَى [see above] to the<br>\
declining of the sun from the meridian; whereas<br>\
the سراب is after the declining of the sun from the<br>\
meridian to the prayer of the عَصْر; and in favour<br>\
of their assertion they urge, that the former [in<br>\
appearance] raises everything so that it becomes<br>\
what is termed آل, i. e. شَخْص; for the آل of<br>\
everything is its شخص; and that the سراب [in<br>\
appearance] lowers every شخص in it so that it<br>\
becomes [as though it were] cleaving to the<br>\
ground, having no شخص: Yoo says, the Arabs<br>\
say that the آل is from the غُدْوَة [or period between the prayer of daybreak and sunrise] to the<br>\
time when the sun is very high, or near the meridian; then it is called سراب for the rest of the<br>\
day: ISk says, the آل is that which [in appearance] raises figures seen from a distance (شخوص),<br>\
and is in the ضُحَى [explained above]; and the<br>\
سراب is that which is upon the surface of the<br>\
ground, as though it were water, and is at midday: and this, I [namely Az] say, is what I have<br>\
found the Arabs in the desert to say: (T:) El-<br>\
Hareeree speaks of the glistening of the آل; app.<br>\
using this word in the sense of سراب; for it is the<br>\
latter that glistens; not the former: (Har p. 363:)<br>\
the word is masc. and fem. (Msb, K.) The<br>\
phrase يَرفَعُ الْآلَا, ending a verse (S, M) of En-Nábighah, (M, TA,) i. e. Edh-Dhubyánee, (TA,)<br>\
or El-Jaadee, (S,) [variously cited in the S and M<br>\
and TA,] is an instance of inversion; the meaning<br>\
being يَرْفَعُهُ الْآلُ [The آل raising it]: (S, TA:)<br>\
or the meaning is, making the آل conspicuous<br>\
more than it would otherwise be; the agent of<br>\
the verb being a prominent portion of a mountain,<br>\
which, being itself raised [in appearance] by the<br>\
آل, has the effect of doing this. (M.)<br>\

(M, K:) or, (K,) as some say, (M,) it is a pl.<br>\
having no sing. (M, K) as to the letter: (M:)<br>\
[but it is very often used as a sing.:] and the pl.<br>\
is آلَاتٌ. (S, K.) In the saying of &#39;Alee, يَسْتَعْمِلُ<br>\
آلَةَ الدِّينِ فِى طَلَبِ الدُّنيَا [lit. He makes use of<br>\
the instrument of religion in seeking the goods of<br>\
the present world], (assumed tropical:)  science, or knowledge, is<br>\

―<br>\
-b4-  The bier of a corpse. (Abu-l-&#39;Omeythil, S,<br>\
M, K.) Thus, accord. to some, in the following<br>\
verse, (S, * M,) of Kaab Ibn-Zuheyr:<br>\
كُلُّ ابْنِ أُنْثَى وَإِنْ طَالتْ سَلَامَتُهُ<br>\
يَوْمًا عَلَى آلَةٍ حَدْبَآءَ مَحْمُولُ<br>\
[Every son of a female, though his health, or<br>\
safety, long continue, is one day borne upon a<br>\
gibbous bier: for the bier of the Arabs of the<br>\
desert was generally composed of two poles connected by a net-work of cords upon which the<br>\
corpse lay depressed]: (S, M:) or, as some say,<br>\
[in a distressing state, or condition; for, they<br>\
say,] آلَة here signifies حَلَة. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also<br>\
آلٌ, in two places, near the middle of the paragraph.<br>\

K,) the last on the authority of IAar, (TA,) but<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd says that it is إِيَّلٌ, with kesr, (T,) and<br>\
this is the approved form, (TA,) The [animal<br>\
called] وَعْل: (K:) or the male وَعْل; (ISh, T,<br>\
S, Mgh, Msb;) i. e. the mountain-goat: (Msb:)<br>\
accord. to some, (S,) what is called in Persian<br>\
كَوَزْن; (S, Mgh;) by which word Sh explains<br>\
the word إِيَّلٌ: ISh says, it is the animal that is<br>\
very wide between the horns, and bulky, like<br>\
the domestic bull: (T:) [see بَقَرُ الوَحْشِ in art.<br>\
بقر:] and Lth says, it is called thus because it<br>\
resorts (يَؤُولُ) to the mountains: sometimes the<br>\
ى is changed into ج: the fem. is of the same<br>\
three forms with ة: (TA:) and the pl. is أَيَائِلُ<br>\

have been contented with green pasture instead<br>\
of water, at the end of their being in that state;<br>\
(T;) or to milk, (S, M, TA,) and to oil, and<br>\
other things, such as tar, and honey, and wine,<br>\
or beverage: (TA:) pl. ↓ أُيَّلٌ: (S, M:) which<br>\
last word [in one copy of the M written إِيلٌ,<br>\
but this I think a mistranscription,] signifies also<br>\
the remains of thickening, or thick, milk; or,<br>\
as some say, the [seminal] water in the womb:<br>\
(M:) or this same word (أُيَّلٌ) has the last of<br>\
these significations; and also, [as a sing. epithet,]<br>\
the first of the meanings explained in this paragraph; as also آئِلٌ, applied to milk; (K;) or to<br>\
milk thickening, or thick, and mixed; not excessively thick, but in a somewhat good degree, and<br>\
changed in its flavour: (AHát, TA:) or it [app.<br>\
أُيَّلٌ, as in the TK,] signifies the vessel, or receptacle, thereof; (K;) [a meaning assigned in the<br>\
M to إِيَالٌ;] in which milk thickens: (TA:)<br>\
Sh says that ↓ إِيَّلٌ signifies the milk of the أَيَائِل<br>\
[pl. of إِيَّلٌ]; and so says AA: but AHeyth says<br>\
that this is absurd; and that the right word is<br>\
↓ أُيَّلٌ, having the signification first explained in<br>\
this paragraph, i. e. thickening, or thick, milk:<br>\
En-Nadr says that ↓ إِيَّلٌ signifies thick urine of<br>\
she-goats of the mountain; which, when drunk<br>\
by a woman, excites her venereal faculty: (T:)<br>\
or this last word is used to signify milk of an<br>\
إِيَّل, which is said to strengthen in the venereal<br>\
faculty, and to fatten, as Ibn-Habeeb asserts;<br>\
and ↓ أُيَّلٌ, which he affirms to be wrong, is a dial.<br>\
var. thereof; and it may also be a quasi-pl. n.<br>\
thereof: (M:) as a pl. [of آئِلٌ], applied to milk,<br>\
↓ آُيَّلٌ is extr. in two respects; as a pl., of this<br>\
form, of an epithet not applied to an animal; and<br>\
as being regularly أُوَّلٌ. (IJ, M.)<br>\
-A2-  إِنَّهُ لَآئِلُ مَالٍ<br>\
and مَالٍ ↓ أَيِّلُ Verily he is a good manager, or<br>\
tender, of cattle, or camels, or the like. (M, TA.)<br>\

returns; and, to which he, or it, ultimately, or<br>\
eventually, comes]. (TA, [where this is given as<br>\
a signification not mentioned in the K; so that<br>\
مرجع is not here used as an inf. n.: it is, moreover, a signification well known.]) See also 2,<br>\
last sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  A refuge: applied in this sense<br>\
to God. (Har p. 361.)<br>\
هُوَ مُؤْتَالٌ لِقَوْمِهِ مُقْتَالٌ عَلَيْهِمْ He is ruler, or<br>\

judicially. (A, TA.)<br>\
