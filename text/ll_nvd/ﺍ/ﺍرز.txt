(K:) or this is called ↓ أَرْرَةٌ, and أَرْزٌ is the pl.:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S:) [or rather أَرْزٌ is a coll. gen. n.,<br>\
and أَرْزَةٌ is the n. un.:] or the male of that kind<br>\
of tree; (AHn, K;) as also ↓ أَرْزَةٌ; (K;) and<br>\
the author of the Minháj adds, it is that which<br>\
does not produce fruit; but pitch (زِفْت) is extracted from its trunks and roots, and its wood<br>\
is employed as a means of light, like as candles<br>\
are employed; and it grows not in the land of<br>\
the Arabs: A &#39;Obeyd says, ↓ أَرْزَةٌ is the name<br>\
of a tree well known in Syria, called with us<br>\
صَنَوْبَرٌ, because of its fruit: he says also, I have<br>\
seen this kind of tree, called أَرْزَةٌ, and it is called in<br>\
El-&#39;Irák صَنَوْبَرٌ, but this last is the name of the fruit<br>\
of the أَرْز: (TA:) or i. q. عَرْعَرٌ [a name given to<br>\
the cypress and to the juniper-tree]. (K.) It<br>\
is said in a trad., المُجْذِيَةِ ↓ مَثَلُ الكَافِرِ مَثَلُ الأَرْزَةِ<br>\
عَلَى الأَرْضِ حَتَّى يَكُونَ آنْجِعَافُهَا بِمَرَّةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ [The<br>\
similitude of the unbeliever is the similitude of<br>\
the pine-tree standing firmly upon the ground<br>\
until it is pulled up at once]: respecting which<br>\
AA and AO say that it is ↓ الأَرَزَة, with fet-h to<br>\
the ر; meaning the tree called الأَرْزَن: but<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd thinks this to be a mistake, and that<br>\
it is ↓ الأَرْزَة, with the ر quiescent. (L.)<br>\

أَرَزَةٌ The tree called أَرْزَنٌ [which is a hard kind,<br>\
from which staves are made]: (AA, S, K:)<br>\
some say that it is ↓ آرِزَةٌ, of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ;<br>\

last but one, that commonly obtaining among the<br>\
vulgar; (TA;) and the last, of the dial. of &#39;AbdEl-Keys; (S, TA;) [Rice;] a certain grain, (S,<br>\
K,) well known: (K:) [said in the TA to be a<br>\
species of بُرّ; but this is an improper explanation:]<br>\
there are several kinds; Egyptian and Persian and<br>\
Indian; and the best kind is the جوهرى [perhaps<br>\
a mistake for مِصْرىّ, or Egyptian]: it is cold<br>\
and dry in the second degree; or, as some say,<br>\
moderate; or, as some say, hot in the first degree;<br>\
and its husk is poisonous. (El-Minháj, TA.)<br>\
