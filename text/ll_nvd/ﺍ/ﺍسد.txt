other dispositions; (S, A, TA;) as also ↓ استأسد;<br>\
(M, A, K;) [and ↓ تأسّد; (see أَسِدٌ;)] عَلَيْهِ towards him, or against him. (A.) You say<br>\
أَسَدٌ بَيِّنُ الأَسَدِ [A lion bearing evidence of being<br>\
like a lion in boldness]: an extr. phrase, like<br>\
حِقَّةٌ بَيِنَّةٌ الحِّقَةِ; (TA;) which is [said to be] the<br>\
only other instance of the kind. (TA in art. حق.)<br>\

↓ استأسد. (S, Msb, K.) And (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, angry with him: (M, L, K: *) or (so<br>\
accord. to the M and L, but in the K, “and,”)<br>\

أَسِدَ, (S, K,) aor. as above, (K,) and so the inf. n.,<br>\
(TA,) also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He (a man, S) became<br>\
stupified (S, K) by fear (S) at seeing a lion. (S,<br>\
