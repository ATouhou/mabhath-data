أزّى الحَوْضَ, inf. n. تَأْزِيَةٌ (S, K) and تَأْزِىْءٌ,<br>\
or تَوْزِىْءٌ, (accord. to different copies of the S,<br>\
[the latter irregular,]) or both, (accord. to the<br>\
TA,) He put, or made, an إِزَآء [q. v.], to the<br>\
watering-trough or tank; (S, K;) i. e. he put<br>\
upon its mouth a stone, or a جُلَّة [explained<br>\
below, voce إِزَآء], or the like; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ آزاهُ, inf. n. إِيزَآءٌ; (S, TA;) or ↓ تأزّاهُ. (K.)<br>\
3<br>\
آزاهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. مُؤَازَاةٌ, (Msb in art. حذو,<br>\
and TA in art. وزى, &amp;c., [though it would seem<br>\
from the K to be إِيزَآءٌ,]) He (a man, S) was,<br>\
or became, over against it, or opposite to it;<br>\
he faced, or fronted, him, or it. (S, * K, * TA<br>\
in art. وزى.) Accord. to the S, one should not<br>\
say, وَازَاهُ: but it is said in a trad. respecting the<br>\
prayer of fear, فَوَازَيْنَا العَدُوَّ, i. e. And we faced,<br>\
or fronted, the enemy: (TA:) and the inf. n.<br>\
is مُوَازَاةٌ. (TA in art. وزى.) [Its syn. حَاذَاهُ<br>\
is more common.]<br>\
-A2-  [Hence مُؤَازَأْق signifying<br>\
A conformity, a mutual resemblance, or a correspondence, with regard to sound, of two words<br>\
occurring near together; like اِزْدِوَاجٌ &amp;c.: see<br>\
art. زوج.]<br>\
-A3-  [Hence, likewise,] آزِاهُ also signifies<br>\
He contended with him, syn. جَارَاهُ; (K, TA;)<br>\
and opposed, or withstood, him, syn. قَاوَمَهُ. (TA.)<br>\
Whence the saying in a trad., وَفِرْقَةٌ آزَتِ الْمُلُوكَ<br>\
فَقَاتَلَتْهُمْ عَلَى دِينِ اللّٰهِ [And a party contended<br>\
with, and opposed, or withstood, the kings, and<br>\
fought with them for the religion of God].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

آزى الحَوْضَ i. q. أَزَّاهُ, q. v. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And He repaired, or put into a right or proper<br>\
state, the إِزَآء [q. v.] of the watering-trough or<br>\
tank. (IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He poured forth the<br>\
water from its إِزَآء. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And آزى فِيهِ He<br>\
poured forth upon its إِزَاء. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَاَزَّىَ see 2.<br>\
نَاقَةٌ أَزِيَةٌ, (accord. to some copies of the S,)<br>\
or ↓ آزِيَةٌ, (accord. to other copies of the S,) or<br>\
both, (IAar, TA,) each after the manner of a<br>\
relative noun, [having no verb,] (TA,) A she-camel that drinks from the إِزَآء [q. v.]: (TA:) or<br>\
that will not drink save from the إِزَآء of the trough<br>\
or tank; and عَقِرَةٌ signifies one “that will not<br>\
drink save from the عُقْر [thereof]:” (S, TA, and<br>\
IAar in art. عقر in the TA:) or, accord. to IAar,<br>\
that will not come to the watering-trough or tank,<br>\
to drink, until they leave it unoccupied for her;<br>\
as also قَذُورٌ. (TA in the present art.)<br>\
الإِزَآءُ i. q. الحِذَآءُ [The front, as meaning the<br>\
part, place, or location, that is over against,<br>\
opposite, facing, fronting, or in front]. (Msb,<br>\
and K &amp;c. in art. حذو.) You say, هُوَبِإِزَائِهِ He<br>\
is over against, opposite to, facing, fronting, or<br>\
in front of, him; syn. بِحِذَائِهِ, (S,) or مُحَاذِيهِ.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, بِإِزَآئِهِ signifies also Corresponding to it; as when one says,] الأَبْجَلُ عِرْقٌ مِنَ<br>\
الفَرَسِ وَ البَعِيرِ بِإِزَآءِ الأَكْحَلِ مِنَ الإِنْسَانِ [The ابجل<br>\
is a vein of the horse and the camel, corresponding<br>\
to the اكحل of man]. (TA in art. بجل.) [You<br>\
say also, وَضَعَ لَفْظًا بِإِزَآءِ مَعْنَّى He applied a word,<br>\
or phrase, as correspondent to an idea, or a meaning.]<br>\
-A2-  إِزَآءٌ is also applied to a man, and to a<br>\
woman, and to a number of persons, in senses<br>\
here following. (TA.) You say, هُوَ إِزَآءُ الأَمْرِ He<br>\
is the manager, conductor, orderer, regulator, or<br>\
superintendent, of the affair. (S, Msb, TA.) And<br>\
in the same sense the word is used by Homeyd,<br>\
in the phrase إِزَآءُ مَعَاشٍ [The manager, or orderer,<br>\
of the means of subsistence], applied to a woman.<br>\
(TA.) And in an instance in which a poet likens<br>\
the إِزَآء of a watering-trough or tank to the [stinking animal called] ظَرِبَان: (S, TA:) in this case<br>\
it means The water-drawer [of the trough or<br>\
tank]. (As, IB, TA.) [But in relation to a<br>\
watering-trough or tank, it generally has another<br>\
meaning, which see below.] You say also, فُلَانٌ<br>\
إِزَآءٌ مَالٍ (S) [Such a one is] a manager, tender,<br>\
or superintendent, of cattle, or camels &amp;c.; (K, *<br>\
TA;) a good pastor thereof. (TA.) And إِزَآءُ<br>\
الحَرْبِ The vigorous wager, or prosecutor, of war.<br>\
(K.) And فُلَانٌ إِزَآءُ فُلَانٍ Such a one is the fellow<br>\
and assistant of such a one. (TA.) And هُمْ إِزَاؤُهُمْ<br>\
They are their fellows, (K, TA,) who assist<br>\
them, and order, or set in order, their affairs:<br>\
(TA:) or they are those who order, or set in<br>\
order, their affairs. (Msb.) And إِنَّهُ لَإِ زَآءُ خَيْرٍ,<br>\
and شَّرٍ, Verily he is a possessor of goodness,<br>\
and of evilness. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, الإِزَآءُ, (K,)<br>\
or إِزَآءُ العيش, (TK,) The means of sustenance: or what has been caused, or occasioned,<br>\
of plentifulness and easiness, and of superabundance, of sustenance. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  Also The place<br>\
where the water is poured into the wateringtrough or tank; (As, S, K;) i. e. its fore part;<br>\
[the part next to the well or other source whence<br>\
it is filled;] the hinder part, where the camels<br>\
stand when they come to water, being called the<br>\
عُقْر: (S in art. عقر:) or, accord. to AZ, a mass<br>\
of stone, and what is put for protection [of the<br>\
brink of the trough or tank (as it is generally<br>\
constructed of stones cemented and plastered with<br>\
mud)] upon the place where the water is poured<br>\
when the bucket is emptied: (S in the present<br>\
art.:) or the whole (جَمِيع [said in the TA to be<br>\
a mistake for جمع, but this I think extremely<br>\
improbable,]) of what is between the wateringtrough or tank and the cavity of the well,<br>\
[namely,] of the [casing of stones, or bricks,<br>\
called] طَّى: (K:) or a stone, or skin, or جُلَّة<br>\
[i. e. a thing made of palm-leaves woven together,<br>\
generally used as a receptacle for dates], put [for<br>\
protection] upon the mouth [or part of the border<br>\
where the water is poured in] of the wateringtrough or tank: (K, * TA:) in the K, يُوضَعُ عَلَيْهَا<br>\
الحَوْضُ is erroneously put for يوضع عَلَى فَمِ<br>\
الحَوْضِ. (TA.)<br>\
