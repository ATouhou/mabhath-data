load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'اذاإِذَا denotes a thing&#39;s happening suddenly, or unexpectedly; (Mughnee, K;) or one&#39;s experiencing<br>\
the occurrence of a thing when he is in a particular<br>\
state; (S;) like إِذٌ: (S voce إِذٌ:) it pertains<br>\
only to nominal phrases; does not require to<br>\
be followed by a reply, or the complement of<br>\
a condition; does not occur at the commencement<br>\
of a sentence; and signifies the present time,<br>\
(Mughnee, K,) not the future; (Mughnee;) as<br>\
in خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا الأَسَدُ بالبَابِ [I went forth, and lo,<br>\
or behold, or there, or then, at that present time,<br>\
(accord. to different authorities, as will be seen<br>\
below,) the lion was at the door]; and (in the<br>\
saying in the Kur [xx. 21], TA,) فَإِذَا هِىَ حَيَّةٌ<br>\
تَسْعَى [And lo, or behold, &amp;c., it was a serpent<br>\
running]; (Mughnee, K;) and in the saying,<br>\
خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ, which means I went forth,<br>\
and Zeyd presented himself to me suddenly, or<br>\
unexpectedly, at the time, by standing. (S, TA.)<br>\
Accord. to Akh, it is a particle, (Mughnee, K,)<br>\
and his opinion is rendered preferable by their<br>\
saying, خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا إِنَّ زِيْداً بِالبَابِ  [I went forth,<br>\
and lo, or behold, verily Zeyd was at the door];<br>\
for [اذا cannot here be a noun governed in the<br>\
accus. case, as] what follows إِنَّ, which is with<br>\
kesr, does not govern what precedes it: (Mughnee:) accord. to Mbr, it is an adverbial noun of<br>\
place: accord. to Zj, an adverbial noun of time.<br>\
(Mughnee, K.) Ibn-Málik adopts the first of<br>\
these opinions; Ibn-&#39;Osfoor, the second; (Mughnee;) and so El-Fenjedeehee; (TA;) and Z,<br>\
the third; and he asserts that its governing word<br>\
is a verb understood, derived from المُفَاجَأَةُ;<br>\
[agreeably with the explanation cited above from<br>\
the S;] but others hold that the word which<br>\
governs it in the accus. case is the enunciative,<br>\
which is either expressed, as in خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا زَيْدٌ<br>\
جَالِسٌ [I went forth, and there, in that place,<br>\
or then, at that time, Zeyd was sitting], or meant<br>\
to be understood, as in فَإِذَا الأَسَدُ, i. e. حَاضِرٌ [And<br>\
there, or then, the lion was present]; or if it<br>\
be supposed to be [itself] the enunciative, its<br>\
governing word is مُسْتَقِرُّ or اِسْتَقَرَّ [understood]:<br>\
and in the last of the phrases here mentioned, it<br>\
may be an enunciative accord. to the opinion of<br>\
Mbr, the meaning being فَبِالْحَاضِرَةِ الأَسَدُ [And<br>\
among the things present was the lion]; but not<br>\
accord. to the opinion of Zj, because a noun signifying time cannot be the enunciative of one signifying a corporeal thing; nor accord to the opinion<br>\
of Akh, because a particle cannot be used to denote<br>\
the enunciative of such a thing; or, as signifying<br>\
time, it may be the enunciative of such a thing<br>\
if we suppose a prefixed noun to be suppressed,<br>\
the meaning of فَإِذَا الأَسَدُ being فَإِذاَ حُضُورُ الأَسَدِ<br>\
[And then was the presence of the lion]. (Mughnee.) You may say either خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا زَيْدٌ جَالِسٌ<br>\
or جَالِساً [I went forth, and lo, or behold, &amp;c.,<br>\
Zeyd was sitting or Zeyd was there sitting], with<br>\
the nom. as an enunciative and with the accus.<br>\
as a denotative of state. (Mughnee.) The Arabs<br>\
said, قَدْ كُنْتُ أَظُنُّ أَنَّ العَقْرَبَ أَشَدُّ لَسْعَةً مِنَ<br>\
الزُّنْبُورِ فَإِذاَ هُوَ هِى [I used to think that the<br>\
scorpion was more vehement in stinging than<br>\
the hornet, and lo, he is (as vehement as) she],<br>\
and also, فَإِذاَ هُوَ إِيَّاهَا, which Sb disallowed,<br>\
in contending with Ks, who allowed it, and<br>\
appealed for confirmation thereof to certain Arabs,<br>\
whose judgment was pronounced in his favour;<br>\
but it is said that they were bribed to give<br>\
this judgment, or that they knew the place which<br>\
Ks held in the estimation of Er-Rasheed; and<br>\
if the latter expression be of established authority,<br>\
it is irregular and unchaste. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It<br>\
also denotes the complement of a condition, like<br>\
فَ, (S, Msb,) with which it is in this case syn.,<br>\
(Msb,) as in the words of the Kur [xxx. 35],<br>\
وَإِنْ تُصِبْهُمْ سَيِّئَةٌ بِمَا قَدَّمَتْ أَيْدِيهِمْ إِذَا هُمُ يَقْنَطُون<br>\
[And if an evil befall them for that which their<br>\
hands have sent before, (i. e. for sins which they<br>\
have committed,) then they despair]. (S, Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  It is also an adverbial noun denoting future<br>\
time, (S, Msb, Mughnee, K, *) and implying the<br>\
meaning of a condition, (Msb, Mughnee,) and<br>\
this is generally the case when it is not used<br>\
in the manner first explained above. (Mughnee.)<br>\
In this case it is not used otherwise than as<br>\
prefixed to a proposition, (S, Mughnee,) which is<br>\
always verbal, as in the words of the Kur [xxx. 24],<br>\
ثُمَّ إِذَا دَعَاكُمَ دَعْوَةً مِنَ الأَرْضِ إذَا أَنْتُمْ تَخْرُجُونَ<br>\
[Then, when He shall call you, or when He<br>\
calleth you, (for, as in Arabic, so in English,<br>\
a verb which is properly present is often tropically<br>\
future,) with a single call from out the earth,<br>\
lo, or behold, or then, ye shall come forth], in<br>\
which occur both the usages of اذا here mentioned;<br>\
(Mughnee;) and in the phrase, إِذَا جِئْتَ أَكْرَمْتُكَ<br>\
[When thou shalt come, I will treat thee with<br>\
honour]; (Msb;) and in the phrase, أَجِيْؤُكَ إِذَا<br>\
احْمَرَّالبُسْرُ [I will come to thee when the fullgrown unripe dates shall become red], and إِذَا قَدِمَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ [when such a one shall arrive], which shows<br>\
it to be a noun because this is equivalent to<br>\
يَوْمَ يَقْدَمُ فُلَانٌ [on the day when such a one<br>\
shall arrive]: (S:) or in the phrase قُمْ إِذَا احْمَرَّ<br>\
البُسْرُ [and in many other cases] it denotes time<br>\
divested of any accessory idea, the meaning being<br>\
[Arise thou] at the time of the full-grown unripe<br>\
dates&#39; becoming red: and so in the saying of EshSháfi&#39;ee, If a man were to say, أَنْتِ طَالِقٌ إِذَا لَمْ<br>\
أُطَلِّقْكِ, or مَتَى لم اطلّقك, [Thou art divorced<br>\
when I do not divorce thee,] and then be silent<br>\
for a time sufficient for the divorce to be pronounced therein, she would be divorced; but<br>\
should he make it dependent upon a thing in the<br>\
future, the divorce would be delayed to that time,<br>\
as if he said, اذا احمرّ البسر  [using it in the sense<br>\
first assigned to this phrase above]. (Msb.) The<br>\
verb after it is in most cases a pret.: in other<br>\
cases, an aor.: both occur in the saying of Aboo-Dhu-eyb,<br>\
وَ النَّفْسُ رَاغِبَةٌ إِذَا رَغَّبْتَهَا<br>\
وَإِذَا تُرَدُّ إِلَى قَلِيلٍ تَقْنَعُ<br>\
[And the soul is desirous when thou makest it<br>\
desirous; and when thou reducest it, or restrictest<br>\
it, to little, it is content]. (Mughnee.) When it<br>\
is immediately followed by a noun, as in [the<br>\
phrase in the Kur lxxxiv. 1,] إذَا السَّمَآءُ انْشَقَّتْ,<br>\
the noun is an agent with a verb suppressed,<br>\
explained by what follows it; contr. to the opinion<br>\
of Akh; (Mughnee;) the complete phrase being<br>\
إِذَا انْشَقَّتِ السَّمَآءُ انْشَقَّتْ [When the heaven shall<br>\
be cleft, (when) it shall be cleft]; and in like<br>\
manner, إِنْ, as in the saying, in the Kur [ix. 6],<br>\
وَ إِنْ أَحَدٌ مِنَ المُشْرِكِينَ اسْتَجَارَكَ. (I &#39;Akp. 123.)<br>\
And in the saying of the poet,<br>\
إِذَا بَاهِلِىٌّ تَحْتَهُ حَنْظَلِيَّةٌ<br>\
لَهُ وَلَدٌ مِنْهَا فَذَاكَ المُدَرَّعُ<br>\
كَانَ is meant to be understood after اذا [so that<br>\
the meaning is, When a Báhilee (a man of the<br>\
tribe of Báhileh) has, or shall have, as his wife a<br>\
Handhaleeyeh (a woman of the tribe of Handhaleh, who were renowned for generosity), he having<br>\
offspring from her, that (offspring) is, or will<br>\
be, the mail-clad]. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Sometimes it<br>\
denotes past time, (Mughnee, K,) like as إِذْ sometimes denotes future time, (Mughnee,) as in [the<br>\
saying in the Kur lxii. 11,] وَ إِذَا رَأَوْا تِجَارَةً أَوْ لَهْواً<br>\
انْفَضُّوا إِلَيْهَا [And when they saw merchandise or<br>\
sport, they dispersed themselves to it]. (Mughnee,<br>\
K.) [Thus] it occurs in the place of إِذْ, like as إِذْ<br>\
occurs in the place of إِذَا. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And sometimes it denotes the present time; and this is after<br>\
an oath, as in [the phrase in the Kur xcii. 1,]<br>\
وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَى [By the night when it covereth<br>\
with its darkness]. (Mughnee, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  It also<br>\
occurs in the sense of the conditional إِنْ, as in<br>\
the saying, أُكْرِمُكَ إِذَا أَكْرَمْتَنِى, meaning إِنْ<br>\
أَكْرَمْتَنِى [I will treat thee with honour if thou<br>\
treat me with honour]: (T:) [for] what is possible is made dependent upon it as well as what is<br>\
known to be certain, as in the phrases, إِذَا جَآءَ زَيْدٌ<br>\
[If Zeyd come] and إِذَا جَآءَ رَأْسُ الشَّهْرِ [When the<br>\
beginning of the month shall come]; or, accord.<br>\
to Th, there is a difference between إِذَا and إِنْ;<br>\
(Msb;) the latter being held by him to denote<br>\
what is possible, and the former to denote what is<br>\
ascertained; so that one says, إِنْ جَآءَ زَيْدٌ and<br>\
إذَا جَآءَ رَأْسُ الشَّهرِ. (Msb in art. ان.) ―<br>\
-b7-  When a<br>\
verb in the first person sing. of the pret. is<br>\
explained by another verb after it immediately<br>\
preceded by إِذَا, [تَقُولُ is understood before the<br>\
former verb, and therefore] the latter verb must<br>\
be in the second pers. sing., as in لُجْتُهُ إِذَا أَدَرْتَهُ<br>\
فِى فيِكَ [meaning Thou sayest (of a thing) لُجْتُهُ<br>\
when, or if, thou hast turned it about in thy<br>\
mouth]. (MF in art. لوج. See also أَىْ; last<br>\
sentence but one.) ―<br>\
-b8-  It is sometimes redundant,<br>\
like as إِذْ is sometimes [accord. to some], as<br>\
in the saying of &#39;Abd-Menáf Ibn-Riba El-Hudhalee,<br>\
حَتَّى إِذَا أَسْلَكُوهُم فِى قُتَائِدَةٍ<br>\
شَلَّا كَمَا تَطْرُدُ الجَمَّالَةُ الشُّرُدَا<br>\
[Until they made them to pass along Kutáīdeh,<br>\
(here meaning a certain mountain-road so named,<br>\
S in art. قتد,) urging on, like as the owners, or<br>\
attendants, of camels drive those that take fright<br>\
and run away]; for it is the end of the poem: or<br>\
he may have abstained from mentioning the enunciative because of its being known to the hearer.<br>\
(S.) When إِذَا is preceded by حَتَّى, [as in this<br>\
instance,] it is generally held that اذا is not<br>\
governed by حتّى in the gen. case, but is still an<br>\
adverbial noun, حتّى being an inceptive particle<br>\
without government. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b9-  As to what<br>\
it is that governs إِذَا in the accus. case, there are<br>\
two opinions; that it is its conditional proposition;<br>\
or a verb, or the like, in the complement thereof:<br>\
(Mughnee, K:) the former is the opinion of the<br>\
critical judges; so that it is in the predicament of<br>\
مَتَى and حَيْثُمَا and أَيَّانَ. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b10-  Sometimes it is used so as not to denote a condition,<br>\
as in the words of the Kur [xlii. 35], وَإِذَا مَا<br>\
غَضِبُوا هُم يَغفِرُونَ [And when, or whenever, they<br>\
are angry, they forgive], in which it is an adverbial noun relating to the enunciative of the<br>\
inchoative after it; for if it denoted a condition,<br>\
and the nominal proposition were a complement,<br>\
it would be connected by فَ: and the same is the<br>\
case when it is used after an oath, as in an<br>\
ex. given above. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b11-  See also what<br>\
follows.<br>\
إِذًا, (Msb, TA, the latter as on the authority of<br>\
Lth,) with tenween, (TA,) or إِذَن, (T, S, M,<br>\
Msb, Mughnee, K, the first as on the authority of<br>\
Lth,) written in the former manner, (TA,) or in<br>\
the latter, (T,) when connected with a following<br>\
proposition, (T, TA,) and in a case of pause<br>\
written ↓ إِذًا, (T, S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K, TA,)<br>\
and therefore the Basrees hold that in other cases<br>\
it should be written إِذًا, (Msb,) though El-Má-<br>\
zinee and Mbr hold that it should be in this case<br>\
also with ن, while Fr holds that it should be<br>\
written with ا; when it governs, and otherwise<br>\
with ن, in order to distinguish between it and<br>\
[the adverbial noun] إِذَا: (Mughnee:) a particle,<br>\
(S, Msb, Mughnee, TA,) accord. to the general<br>\
opinion; and accord. to this opinion, it is a simple<br>\
word, not compounded of إِذْ and أَنْ; and as<br>\
being simple, it is that which renders an aor.<br>\
mansoob, not أَنْ suppressed and meant to be<br>\
understood after it: some say that it is a noun:<br>\
(Mughnee:) [but a knowledge of its meaning is<br>\
necessary to the understanding of the reason given<br>\
for asserting it to be a noun.] It denotes a<br>\
response, or reply, corroborating a condition;<br>\
(Lth, T, TA;) or compensation, or the complement of a condition; (Msb;) or a response, or<br>\
reply, (Sb, S, Mughnee, K,) in every instance;<br>\
(TA;) and compensation, or the complement of a<br>\
condition, (Sb, S, M, Mughnee, K,) though not<br>\
always: (Mughnee, TA:) and its virtual meaning<br>\
is [Then; i. e., in that case; or] if the case, or<br>\
affair, be as thou hast mentioned, (M, K, TA,)<br>\
or as has happened: (M, TA:) [and hence,]<br>\
accord. to those who say that it is a noun, the<br>\
original form of the phrase إِذَنْ أُكْرِمَكَ [Then, or<br>\
in that case, or if the case be so, I will treat thee<br>\
with honour, said in reply to one who says “ I<br>\
will come to thee,”] is إِذَا جِئْتَنِى أُكرِمُكَ [When<br>\
thou shalt come to me, I will treat thee with<br>\
honour]; then the proposition [جئتنى] is thrown<br>\
out, and tenween [or ن] is substituted for it,<br>\
(Mughnee,) for which reason, and to distinguish<br>\
between it and [the adverbial] ن, the Koofees<br>\
hold that it should be written with إِذَا, (Msb,) and<br>\
أَنْ [preceded by يَجِبُ عَلَىَّ or the like] is suppressed and meant to be understood [as that which<br>\
renders the aor. mansoob; so that when one says<br>\
إِذَنْ أُكْرِمَكَ, it is as though he said إِذَا جِئْتَنِى<br>\
When thou shalt come to<br>\
me, it will be incumbent, or obligatory, on me to<br>\
treat thee with honour]. (Mughnee.) It renders<br>\
an aor. following it mansoob on certain conditions:<br>\
(Mughnee, TA:) to have this effect, the aor. must<br>\
have a future signification, (T, S, Mughnee, TA,)<br>\
not present: (TA:) يَجِبُ عَلَىَّ أَنْ أُكُرِمَكَ must commence the phrase<br>\
in which the aor. occurs; (Mughnee, TA;) [or,<br>\
in other words,] the aor. must not be syntactically<br>\
dependent upon what precedes اذا: (TA:) and<br>\
there must be nothing intervening between اذا and<br>\
the aor., (T, Mughnee, TA,) unless it is a particle,<br>\
(T,) or an oath, (T, Mughnee,) or the negative لَا:<br>\
(Mughnee:) therefore, to a person who says,<br>\
“To-night I will visit thee,” (S,) or who says,<br>\
“I will come to thee,” (Mughnee,) you say,<br>\
إِذَنْ أُكْرِمَكَ [Then, or in that case, &amp;c., I will<br>\
treat thee with honour]; (T, S, Mughnee;) and<br>\
to one who says, “I will treat thee with honour,”<br>\
you say, إِذًا أَجِيْئَكَ [Then, or if the case be so, I<br>\
will come to thee]. (TA.) When the verb after<br>\
اذن has the present signification, it does not<br>\
govern: (S, Mughnee, TA:) therefore, to a person who says, “I love thee,” you say, إِذَنْ أَظُنُّكَ<br>\
[Then, or if the case be so, I think thee<br>\
veracious]; for this is a mere reply: (Mughnee:)<br>\
and to one talking to thee, إِذًا أَظُنُّكَ كَاذبًا [Then<br>\
I think thee to be lying]. (TA.) When it is put<br>\
in a middle place, (S,) not commencing the phrase,<br>\
(Mughnee,) the verb after it not being syntactically dependent upon what is before it, (S, TA,)<br>\
it does not govern: (S, Mughnee, TA:) therefore, to one who says, “I will come to thee,”<br>\
(Mughnee, TA,) you say, أَنَا إِذَنْ أُكْرِمُكَ [I, in<br>\
that case, will treat thee with honour]: (S, Mughnee, TA:) for اذن among the words which govern<br>\
verbs is likened to الظَّنُّ among those which<br>\
govern nouns: (S:) and when it is put at the<br>\
end, it does not govern; as when you say,<br>\
أُكرِْمُكَ [I will treat thee with honour in that<br>\
case]. (S.) The saying [of the poet, or rájiz],<br>\
لَا تَتْرُكَنِّى فِيهِمُ شَطِيرَا<br>\
إِنِّى إِذًا أَهْلِكَ أَوْ أَطِيرَا<br>\
is explained by regarding it as an instance of the<br>\
suppression of the enunciative of إِنّ, so that the<br>\
meaning is, إِنِّى لاَ أَقْدِرُ عَلَى ذٰلِكَ, and then a<br>\
new phrase commences [wherefore the verse means<br>\
Do not thou leave me among them remote, or<br>\
a stranger: verily I cannot endure that: in that<br>\
case I should perish, or I should flee]. (Mughnee.) When it is immediately preceded by a<br>\
conjunction such as وَ or فَ, the aor. may be<br>\
either marfooa or mansoob. (S, Mughnee.)<br>\
When a noun is introduced between it and the<br>\
aor., the latter is marfooa, (T, Mughnee,) as<br>\
in the saying, إِذَنْ أَخُوكَ يُكْرِمُكَ [Then, or in<br>\
that case, thy brother will treat thee with honour],<br>\
(T,) or إِذًا يَا عَبْدَ اللّٰهِ أُكُرِمُكَ [Then, or in that<br>\
case, O ‘Abd-Allah, I will treat thee with honour];<br>\
but Ibn-’Osfoor allows the intervention of an<br>\
adverbial noun [without annulling the government]; and Ibn-Bábshádh, that of the vocative,<br>\
and of a prayer; and Ks and Hishám, that of a<br>\
word governed by the verb; but Ks in this case<br>\
prefers nasb; and Hishám, refa. (Mughnee.)<br>\
When you put an oath in the place of the noun,<br>\
you make the aor. mansoob, as in the saying,<br>\
إِذًا وَ اللّٰهِ تَنَامَ [Then, or if the case be so, by<br>\
God, thou wilt sleep]: but if you prefix ل to<br>\
the verb with the oath, you make the aor. marfooa,<br>\
saying, إذَنْ وَاللّٰهِ لَتَنْدَهُم [Then, or if the case be<br>\
so, by God, assuredly thou wilt regret, or repent].<br>\
(T.) When you introduce a particle between it<br>\
and the aor., you make the latter either marfooa<br>\
or mansoob, saying, إِذَنْ لَا أُكْرِمُكَ and لَا أُكُرِمَكَ<br>\
[Then, or in that case, I will not treat thee with<br>\
honour]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Sometimes the ا is rejected,<br>\
and they say, ذَنْ لَا أَفُعَلُ [Then, (a word exactly<br>\
agreeing with ذَنْ in sound as well as in meaning,) or in that case, I will not do such a thing].<br>\
(M, K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  IJ relates, on the authority of<br>\
Khálid, that إِذًا is used in the dial. of Hudheyl<br>\
for إِذًا. (M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  إِذَنْ or إِذًا is mentioned and<br>\
explained in the S and K and TA in art. اذن,<br>\
and in the TA in باب الالف الليّنة also.]<br>\
