(AZ, AHát, T, M, Msb,) also of أَنِسَ, (AZ,<br>\
AHát, Msb, TA,) but this is rare, (T, TA,)<br>\
and أُنْسٌ, (T, S, M, A, K,) which is the more<br>\
common, (T, TA,) and is of أَنَسَ, (S,) or أُنْسٌ has<br>\
a different signification from إِنْسٌ the inf. n. of<br>\
أَنِسَ, [see أُنْسٌ below,] (AZ, AHát,) or it is a<br>\
subst. from أَنِسَ بِهِ, (Msb,) and أُنْسَةٌ; (M;) [but<br>\
this also is probably a subst.;] one says أُنْسٌ and<br>\
أُنْسَةٌ, like as one says بُعْدٌ and بُعْدَة; (Ham p. 768;)<br>\
He was, or became, sociable, companionable, conversable, inclined to company or converse, friendly,<br>\
amicable, or familiar, with him, or by means of<br>\
him, and to him: and [انس به] he was, or became,<br>\
cheered, or gladdened, by his company or converse,<br>\
or by his, or its, presence; or cheerful, gay, or gladsome: the inf. n. signifying the contr. of وَحْشَةٌ: (T,<br>\
S, A, K:) or he was, or became, at ease, or tranquil,<br>\
with him: (M:) or his heart was, or became, at ease,<br>\
or tranquil, with him; without shrinking, or aversion: (Msb:) and بِهِ ↓ استأنس, (S, M, A, Msb,) and<br>\
إِلَيْهِ, (A,) and بِهِ ↓ تأنّس, signify the same, (S,<br>\
M, Msb,) i. e., the same as أَنِسَ (M, A, Msb,<br>\
TA) and أَنَسَ (M, Msb) and أُنُسَ: (M:) أَنِسَ بِفُلَانٍ<br>\
is likewise explained as signifying he delighted, or<br>\
rejoiced, in such a one; he was happy, or pleased,<br>\
with him: (IAar, TA:) [and ↓ آنسهُ, a form of frequent occurrence, inf. n. مُؤَانَسَةٌ, which occurs in<br>\
this art. in the TA, also signifies he was, or became,<br>\
sociable, &amp;c., with him; like أَنِسَ بِهِ &amp;c.: it is<br>\
also said in the TA that أَنِسَ بِهِ and بِهِ ↓ آنَسَ are<br>\
syn., meaning, app., like استأنس and تأنّس به,<br>\

measure فَاعَلَ; but this admits of some doubt, as<br>\
it is said immediately after آنسهُ as meaning the<br>\
contr. of أَوْحَشَهُ:] and ↓ استأنس, (K, TA,) said of<br>\
a wild animal, (TA,) signifies [he became familiar,<br>\
or tame, or domesticated; or] his wildness (تَوَحُّشُهُ)<br>\
departed: (K, TA:) you say إِذَا جَآءَ اللَّيْلُ اسْتَأْنَسَ<br>\
كُلُّ وَحْشِىٍّ وَاسْتَوْحَشَ كُلُّ إِنْسِىٌ [When the night<br>\
comes, every wild animal becomes familiar with<br>\
his kind, and every human being becomes shy of<br>\
his kind, i. e., of such thereof as he does not know,<br>\
when meeting them in the dark]. (A, TA, Msb<br>\
in art. وحش.)<br>\

him; [see 1, in two places;] he, or it, cheered him,<br>\
or gladdened him, by his company or converse, or by<br>\
his, or its, presence; he, or it, solaced, or consoled,<br>\
him; contr. of أَوْحَشَهُ; (S, * K;) as also ↓ أنّسهُ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. تَأْنِيسٌ: (S, K:) or he, or it, rendered<br>\
him easy, at ease, or tranquil; as also ↓ the latter<br>\
verb, occurring in the following ex.: سَمَّاهَا<br>\
بِالْمُؤْنِسَاتِ لِأَنَّهُنَّ يُؤَنِّسْنَهُ بِأَقْرَانِهِ فَيُؤَمِّنَّهُ أَوْيُحَسِّنَّ<br>\
ظَنِّهُ [He has called them (referring to weapons)<br>\
المؤنسات because they render him at ease with his<br>\
adversaries, and secure, or cause him to have<br>\
a good opinion of his safety, and thus, cheer him,<br>\
or solace him, by their presence]. (M: [and<br>\
the like is said in the A.])<br>\
-A2-  He perceived it;<br>\
syn. of the inf. n. إِدْرَاكٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He saw<br>\
him, or it, (S, M, A, * Msb, K,) and looked at<br>\
him, or it; (M, TA;) as also ↓ أنّسهُ, inf. n.<br>\
تَأْنِيسٌ; (K;) and ↓ استأنسهُ: (M:) or he saw<br>\
it so that there was no doubt or uncertainty in<br>\
it: or he saw it, meaning a thing by the sight<br>\
or presence of which he was cheered, gladdened,<br>\
solaced, or consoled; إِينَاسٌ signifying إِبْصَارُ مَا<br>\
يُؤْنَسُ بِهِ: (Bd in xx. 9:) or he saw it, not having<br>\
before known it, or been acquainted with it.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He heard it; namely, a sound or voice.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He felt it; was sensible of it; (M, K,<br>\
TA;) experienced it in himself; (TA;) namely,<br>\
[for instance,] fright, or fear. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He<br>\
knew it: (S, M, Msb, K:) he was acquainted<br>\
with it: (TA:) he had certain knowledge of it;<br>\
was certain of it. (M, TA.) You say, آنَسْتُ<br>\
مِنْهُ رُشْدًا (S, A, TA) I knew him to be characterized by رُشْد, (S, TA,) i. e., maturity of intel-lect, and rectitude of actions, and good management of affairs. (TA.) [See Kur iv. 5.] And<br>\
it is said in a prov., بَعْدَ اطِّلَاعٍ إِينَاسٌ, i. e. After<br>\
appearance [is knowledge, or certain knowledge].<br>\
(Fr, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تأنّس بِهِ: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  تأنّس البَازي The falcon<br>\
looked, raising his head (M, A, K) and his eyes.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تأنّس لَهُ: see 10.<br>\
10<br>\
استأنس, and استأنس بِهِ and إِلَيْهِ: see 1.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
استأنس signifies also He (a wild animal) became<br>\
sensible of the presence or nearness of a human<br>\
being. (S, K.)<br>\
-A3-  He looked; as in the phrase<br>\
اِذْهَبْ فَاسْتَأْنِسْ هَلْ تَرَى أَحَدًا [Go thou and look<br>\
if thou see any one]: (Fr, TA:) he considered,<br>\
or examined, endeavouring to obtain a clear knowledge of a thing; (K, TA;) and looked aside, or<br>\
about, to ascertain if he could see any one:<br>\
(TA:) he sought, or asked for, knowledge, or<br>\
information; he inquired: (M, TA:) and hence,<br>\
(Bd in xxiv. 27,) he asked permission. (Fr, Zj,<br>\
K, TA, and Bd ubi suprà.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[xxiv. 27], لَا تَدْخُلُوا بُيُوتًا غَيْرَ بُيُوتِكُمْ حَتَّي تَسْتَأْنِسُوا<br>\
وَتُسَلِّمُوا [Enter ye not houses other than your<br>\
own houses] until ye inquire whether its inhabitants desire that ye should enter or not; [and<br>\
salute:] (M:) or (which is essentially the same,<br>\
M) until ye ask permission: (Fr, Zj, M, TA:)<br>\
but Fr says that the sentence presents an inversion,<br>\
and that the meaning is, until ye salute, and ask<br>\
if ye shall enter or not: (TA:) I&#39;Ab says that<br>\
تَستأنسوا is a mistranscription; and he and Ubeí<br>\
and Ibn-Mes&#39;ood read تَسْتَأْذِنُوا, which signifies<br>\
the same: (Az, TA:) [it is said that] استأنس<br>\
also signifies he made a reiterated hemming, like<br>\
a slight coughing; [as a man does to notify his<br>\
nearness;] syn. تَنَحْنَحَ: and so some explain it<br>\
in the text of the Kur quoted above. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
استأنس لَهُ He listened to, or endeavoured or sought<br>\
to hear, him, or it; as also ↓ تأنّس. (A.) [See<br>\
the Kur xxxiii. 53.]<br>\
-A4-  استأنسهُ: see 4.<br>\
أُنْسٌ Sociableness; companionableness; conversableness; inclination to company or converse;<br>\
friendliness; amicableness; socialness; familiarity: cheerfulness; gayness; gladsomeness:<br>\
contr. of وَحْشَةٌ: (T, S, A, K:) joy; gladness;<br>\
happiness: (Har p. 652:) or ease, or tranquillity: (M:) or ease, or tranquillity, of heart, and<br>\
freedom from shrinking, or from aversion:<br>\
(Msb:) an inf. n. of 1, (S, M,) as are also ↓ أَنَسٌ<br>\
and ↓ أَنَسَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ إِنْسٌ, (M,) but this is<br>\
rare as signifying the contr. of وَحْشَةٌ: (T, TA:)<br>\
or ↓ إِنْسٌ is the inf. n. of أَنِسَ بِهِ; but أُنُسٌ is not:<br>\
(AZ, AHát, Msb, TA:) this latter is a subst. from<br>\
that verb [signifying as explained above]: (Msb:)<br>\
or only signifying converse, and companionship,<br>\
or familiarity, with women; (AZ, AHát, TA;)<br>\
or amatory conversation and conduct; or the talk<br>\
of young men and young women: (Fr, TA:)<br>\
[but of all the forms above, أُنْسٌ is that which<br>\
is most commonly used, at least in post-classical<br>\
works, as signifying the contr. of وَحْشَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Also (assumed tropical:)  Delight, as meaning a cause of delight,<br>\
or thing that gives delight.] A poet says,<br>\
يَا سَاكِنِى مَكَّةَ لَا زِلْتُمُ<br>\
أُنْسًا لَنَا إِنِّىَ لَمْ أَنْسَكُمْ<br>\
مَا فِيكُمُ عَيْبٌ سِوَى قَوْلِكُمْ<br>\
عِنْدَ اللِّقَا أَوْحَشَنَا أُنْسُكُمْ<br>\
[O inhabitants of Mekkeh, may ye not cease to<br>\
be a delight to us: verily I have not forgotten<br>\
you: there is in you no fault beside your saying,<br>\
at meeting, Your sociableness, or companiableness,<br>\
&amp;c., has made us feel lonely and sad; meaning,<br>\
in your absence]. (TA in art. وحش.) [See<br>\
أَوْحَشَ. But this signification, though allowable<br>\
as tropical, is perhaps post-classical.] ―<br>\
-b3-  اِبْنُ أُنْس:<br>\
and فُلَانٌ ابْنُ أُنْسِ فُلَانٍ: and كَيْفَ ابْنُ أُنْسِكَ:<br>\
and كَيْفَ تَرَى ابْنَ أُنْسِكَ: see إِنْسٌ.<br>\
إِنْسٌ: see أُنْسٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  (tropical:)  A chosen,<br>\
select, particular, or special, friend or companion;<br>\
(S, K;) as also اِبْنُ إِنْسٍ (S, K,) or ↓ اِبْنُ أُنْسٍ.<br>\
(So in a copy of the A.) You say, هٰذَا إِنْسِى;<br>\
(S;) and إِنْسُكَ, and ابْنُ إِنْسِكَ; (K;) (tropical:)  This is<br>\
my chosen, or particular, friend; (S;) and thy<br>\
chosen, or particular, friend. (K.) And فُلَانٌ<br>\
ابْنُ إِنْسِ فُلَانٍ (S,) or فلان ↓ ابن أُنْسِ (A,)<br>\
(tropical:)  Such a one is the chosen, or particular, friend<br>\
of such a one. (S, A.) One also says, كَيْفَ<br>\
ابْنُ إِنْسِكَ and ↓ أُنْسِكَ, (S, M,) or كَيْفَ تَرَي ابْنَ<br>\
إِنْسِكَ (AZ, Fr, A) and ↓ أُنْسِكَ, (A,) meaning himself, (AZ, Fr, S, S TA,) i. e., (assumed tropical:)  How dost thou regard<br>\
me in my companionship with thee? (S:) or<br>\
the meaning is, (tropical:)  how dost thou find thyself?<br>\
(A:) or how is thyself? (M, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Mankind;<br>\
(S, M, A, K;) the opposite of جِنٌّ; (Msb;) as<br>\
also ↓ أَنَسٌ, (Akh, S, TA,) and ↓ إِنْسَانٌ; (A, K;)<br>\
the last being a gen. n., (Msb,) but applied to the<br>\
male (S, * Msb) and female, (S, Msb, K,) and sing.<br>\
and pl.: (Msb:) one is [also] termed ↓ إِنْسِىٌّ and<br>\
↓ أَنَسِىٌّ; (S, K;) the former of which is a rel. n.<br>\
from إِنْسٌ; (M;) [and the latter, from أَنَسٌ: the<br>\
fem. of each is with Bْ:] the vulgar apply to a<br>\
woman, instead of ↓ إِنْسَانٌ, [which is the more<br>\
approved,] ↓ إِنْسَانَةٌ: (S, K:) this latter [accord.<br>\
to some] should not be used: (S:) but it is correct, though rare: it is said in the K to occur<br>\
in poetry, but supposed to be post-classical: it<br>\
occurs, however, in classical poetry, and has been<br>\
transmitted by several authors: (MF:) the pl.<br>\
(of إِنْسٌ, M, TA) is آنَاسٌ; (M, K, TA;) and<br>\
(of the same, K in art. نوس, or of ↓ إِنْسَانٌ, M)<br>\
أُنَاسٌ, (M, K ubi suprà,) with which نَاسٌ is syn.,<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K,) being a contraction thereof; (Sb,<br>\
S, M, Msb;) and (of ↓ إِنْسِىٌّ, S, M, or ↓ أَنَسِىٌّ,<br>\
S, or of ↓ إِنْسَانٌ, Lh, S, M, Msb) أَنَاسِىٌّ, (Lh, S,<br>\
M, Msb, K,) like as كَرَاسِىُّ is pl. of كُرْسِىٌّ, or<br>\
like as سَرَاحينُ is pl. of سِرحَانٌ, but ى being<br>\
substituted for ن, (M, TA,) after the same manner as they say أَرَانٍ for أَرَانِبُ; (Fr, TA;) and<br>\
أَنَاسٍ, (Lh, M,) in the accus. case أَنَاسِىَ, as the<br>\
word is read in the Kur xxv. 51, by Ks, (TA,)<br>\
and by Yahyà Ibn-El-Hárith, (K, TA,) dropping<br>\
the ى between the second and last radical letters,<br>\
[for, with some others, it seems, they held the<br>\
word to be derived from the root نسى,] (TA,)<br>\
and أَنَاسِيَةٌ, (S, M, K,) in which the ة is a substitute for one of the two yás in أَنَاسِىُّ, a pl. of<br>\
إِنْسَانٌ; or, accord. to Mbr, أَنَاسِيَةٌ is pl. of إِنْسِىٌّ,<br>\
[in the TA, of إِنْسِيَّةٌ, which I regard as a mistranscription,] and is like زَنَادَقَةٌ for زَنَادِيقُ, and<br>\
فَرَازِتَةٌ for فَرَازِينُ; (M, TA;) and you say also<br>\
إِنْسَيُّونَ. (TA.) نَاسٌ is masc., as in the Kur<br>\
ii. 19, &amp;c.; and sometimes fem., as meaning A<br>\
tribe, or a body of men, قَبِيلَةٌ, or طَائِفَةٌ; as in<br>\
the phrase, mentioned by Th, جَآءَتَْكَ النَّاسُ, meaning, The tribe, or portion of people (قِطْعَة), came<br>\
to thee. (M, TA.) ↓ بَنُوالإِنْسَانِ means The sons<br>\
of Adam. (M.) And النَّاسُ النَّاسُ, an expression<br>\
mentioned by Sb, means, Men in every place and<br>\
in every state are men: a poet says,<br>\
بِلَادٌ بَهَا كُنَّا وَكُنَّا نُحِبُّهَا<br>\
إِذِ النَّاسُ نَاسٌ وَالبِلَادُ بِلَادُ<br>\
meaning [A country in which we were, and<br>\
which we used to love,] since the men were ingenuous men, and the country was a fruitful<br>\
country. (M.) The following trad., لَوْ أَطَاعَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
النَّاسَ فِى النَّاسِ لَمْ يَكُنْ نَاسٌ If God complied<br>\
with the prayer of men with respect to men there<br>\
would be no men, is said to mean, that men love<br>\
to have male children born to them, and not<br>\
females, and if there were no females, or if the<br>\
females were not, men would cease to be. (TA.)<br>\
It is related that a party of the jinn, or genii,<br>\
came to a company of men, and asked permission<br>\
to go in to them, whereupon the latter said to<br>\
them, Who are ye? and they answered, نَاسٌ مِنَ<br>\
الجنِّ [A people of the jinn], making their answer<br>\
to accord. with common usage; for it is customary<br>\
for men, when it is said to them, Who are ye?<br>\
to answer, نَاسٌ مِنْ بَنِى فُلَانٍ [Men of the sons<br>\
of such a one]. (IJ, M, L: but in the L, for<br>\
ناس, in both instances, we find أُنَاسٌ.) [See also<br>\
نَاسٌ in art. نوس.] Respecting the derivation of<br>\
↓ إِنْسَانٌ, authors differ, though they agree that<br>\
the final ن is augmentative: the Basrees say that<br>\
it is from الإِنْسُ; (Msb;) and its measure is<br>\
فِعْلَانٌ; (S, Msb;) but an addition, of ى, is<br>\
made in its dim., [which is أُنَيْسِيَانٌ,] like as an<br>\
addition is made in رُوَيْجِلٌ, the dim. of رَجُلٌ:<br>\
(S:) [but it should be observed that رُوَيْجِلٌ is more<br>\
probably the dim. of رَاجِلٌ:] some say that it is<br>\
from إِينَاسٌ, signifying “perception,” or “sight,”<br>\
and “knowledge,” and “sensation;” because<br>\
man uses these faculties: (TA:) and Mohammad<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Arafeh El-Wásitee says that men are called<br>\
إِنسِيُّونِ because they are seen (يُؤْنَسُونَ, i. e.<br>\
يُرَوْنَ), and that the jinn are called جِنّ because<br>\
they are [ordinarily] concealed (مُجْتَنُّونَ, i. e.<br>\
مُتَوَارُونَ,) from the sight of men: (TA:) [it is<br>\
said in the B, as cited in the TA, that the form<br>\
أَنِسَان is also used for إِنْسَانٌ; as though it were<br>\
a dual, meaning “a double associate,” i. e., an<br>\
associate with the jinn and with his own kind;<br>\
for it is added, أَنِسَ بِالآْجِنِّ وَأَنِسَ بِالآْخَلْقِ:] some<br>\
derive the word from النَّوْسُ, signifying “motion:”<br>\
(TA:) some (namely, the Koofees, Msb) say that<br>\
it is originally إِنسِيَانٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) of the<br>\
measure إِفْعِلَانٌ, (S, Msb,) from النِّسْيَانُ [“forgetfulness”], (Msb,) and contracted to make it<br>\
more easy of pronunciation, because of its being so<br>\
often used; (S;) but it is restored to its original<br>\
in forming the dim., (S, Msb,) which is أُنَيْسِيَانٌ:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) this form of the dim., they say,<br>\
shows the original form of the word which is its<br>\
source; (TA;) and they adduce as an indication<br>\
of its derivation the saying of I&#39;Ab, إِنَّمَا سُمِّيَ<br>\
إِنْسَانًا لِأَنَّهُ عُهِدَ إِلَيْهِ فَنَسِىَ [He (meaning the first<br>\
man) was only named انسان because he was commanded and he forgot]: (S, TA:) [in like manner,] it is said that النَّاسُ is originally النَّاسِى; the<br>\
former of these, accord. to one reading, and the<br>\
latter accord. to another, occurs in the Kur ii. 195;<br>\
the latter referring to Adam, and to the words of<br>\
the Kur in xx. 114: (TA:) but Az holds that<br>\
إِنْسِيَانٌ is of the measure فِعْلِيَانٌ, from الإِنْسُ,<br>\
and similar to خِرْصِيَانٌ. (L, TA. *)<br>\

-b3-<br>\
A tribe (حَىُّ) staying, residing, dwelling, or<br>\
abiding: (S, K:) the people of a place of alighting<br>\
or abode: (M, TA: [but in the latter, in one<br>\
place, said to be إِنْسٌ, with kesr; though a verse<br>\
cited in both, as an ex., shows it to be أَنَسٌ:]) the<br>\
inhabitants of a house: (AA, TA:) pl. (of the<br>\
word in the first sense, of these three, TA, and in<br>\
the second, M, TA) آنَاسٌ. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  One with<br>\
whom a person is sociable. (Ham p. 136.) You say<br>\
also, هُمْ أَنَسُ فُلَانٍ They are they with whom such<br>\
a one is sociable (اَلَّذِينَ يَسْتَأْنِسُ إِلَيْهِمْ). (Lh, M.)<br>\
And هُوَ أَنَسُ فُلَانٍ He is much accustomed to the<br>\
serving of him. (Har p. 472.)<br>\
أَنَسَةٌ i. q. أُنْسٌ, q. v. (S, K.)<br>\
إِنْسِىُّ Of, or belonging to, mankind; human;<br>\
[as also ↓ أَنَسِىٌّ, and ↓ إِنْسَانِىُّ;] a rel. n. from<br>\
إِنْسٌ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A human being; a man; as also<br>\
↓ أَنَسِىٌّ, (S, K,) and ↓ إِنْسَانٌ. (S, A, Msb, K.) See<br>\
إِنْسٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  [Domestic, as opposed to<br>\
wild. Ex.] حُمُرٌ إِنْسِيَّةٌ Domestic asses; asses that<br>\
are accustomed to the houses: commonly known as<br>\
written with kesr to the أُنْسِيَّةٌ: but in the book of<br>\
Aboo-Moosà is an indication of its being with<br>\
damm to the ء [أَنَسِيَّةٌ]: and as some relate a trad.<br>\
in which it occurs, أَنَسِيَّةٌ, which is said to be of no<br>\
account. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The left side (AZ, S, M, Msb,<br>\
K) of an animal, (Msb,) or of a beast and of a<br>\
man, (M,) or of anything: (AZ, S, K:) or the<br>\
right side: (As, S:) [but the latter seems to be a<br>\
mistake:] Az says that Lth has well explained<br>\
this term and its contrary وَحْشِىٌّ, saying that the<br>\
latter is the right side of every beast; and the<br>\
former, the left side; agreeably with those of the<br>\
first authority in sound learning; and [that] it is<br>\
related of El-Mufaddal and As and AO, that all<br>\
of them asserted the latter to be, of every animal<br>\
except man, [the “far” side, or “off” side,] the<br>\
side on which it is not milked nor mounted; and<br>\
the former, [the near side,] the side on which the<br>\
rider mounts and the milker milks: (TA in art.<br>\
وحش:) [and the like is said, as a citation from Az,<br>\
in the Msb in art. وحش: but after this, in my<br>\
copy of the Msb, there seems to be an omission;<br>\
for it is immediately added, “But Az says, This<br>\
is not correct in my opinion:”] it is said that<br>\
everything that is frightened declines to its right<br>\
side; for the beast is approached to be mounted<br>\
and milked on the left side, and, fearing thereat,<br>\
runs away from the place of fear, which is the left<br>\
side, to the place of safety, which is the right side:<br>\
(S, * IAmb in Msb; both in art. وحش:) [accordingly,] Er-Rá&#39;ee describes a beast as declining<br>\
to the side termed الوحشى because frightened on<br>\
the left side: (S and Msb in art. وحش:) and<br>\
&#39;Antarah alludes to one&#39;s shrinking with the side<br>\
so termed from the whip, [which he likens to a<br>\
cat,] because the whip of the rider is in his right<br>\
hand: (S in art. وحش:) but Abu-l-&#39;Abbás says<br>\
that people differ respecting these two terms when<br>\
relating to a man: that, accord. to some, they<br>\
mean the same in this case as in the cases of horses<br>\
and other beasts of carriage, and of camels: but<br>\
some say, that in the case of a man, the latter term<br>\
means the part next the shoulder-blade; and the<br>\
former, the part next the arm-pit. (TA in art.<br>\
وحش.) Of every double member of a man, as the<br>\
upper half of each arm, and the two fore arms,<br>\
and the two feet, it means That [side] which is<br>\
towards the man; and وحشىّ, that which turns<br>\
away from him: (As, S:) or, of the foot, the<br>\
former means that [side] which is towards the<br>\
other foot; [i. e., the inner side;] and the latter,<br>\
the contrary of the former. (TA in art. وحش.)<br>\
Of a bow, (S, M, K,) or of a Persian bow, (TA in<br>\
art. وحش,) That [side] which is towards thee;<br>\
(S, K;) and وحشىّ, the back: (S and K in art.<br>\
وحش:) or the former, that [side] which is next to<br>\
the archer; and the latter, that which is next to<br>\
the animal shot at: (M, TA:) or of a bow, whether<br>\
Persian or not is not said, [the former means the<br>\
side against which the arrow lies; and] the latter,<br>\
the side against which the arrow does not lie.<br>\
