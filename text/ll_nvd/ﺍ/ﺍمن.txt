أَمِنَ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
اَمَنَ, (T, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. أَمْنٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and إِمْنٌ (Zj, M,<br>\
K) and أَمَنٌ (M, K) and أَمَنَةٌ (T, S, M, K) and<br>\
إِمْنَةٌ (T) and أَمَانٌ (M, K) [and app. أَمَانَةٌ, for<br>\
it is said in the S that this is syn. with أَمَانٌ,]<br>\
and آمنٌ, an instance of an inf. n. of the measure<br>\
فَاعِلٌ, which is strange, (MF,) or this is a subst.<br>\
like فَالِجٌ, (M,) He was, or became, or felt,<br>\
secure, safe, or in a state of security or safety;<br>\
originally, he was, or became, quiet, or tranquil,<br>\
in heart, or mind; (Msb;) he was, or became,<br>\
secure, or free from fear; أَمْنٌ signifying the<br>\
contr. of خَوْفٌ, (S, M, K,) and so أَمَنَةٌ (S) and<br>\
آمِنٌ [&amp;c.]: (M, K:) he was, or became, or felt,<br>\
free from expectation of evil, or of an object of<br>\
dislike or hatred, in the coming time; originally,<br>\
he was, or became, easy in mind, and free from<br>\
fear. (El-Munáwee, TA.) [See أَمْنٌ, below.]<br>\
You say also, يَإْمَنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ [He is secure,<br>\
or safe, or free from fear, for himself]. (M.)<br>\
And أَمِنَ البَلَدُ, meaning The inhabitants of the<br>\
country or district, or town, were in a state of<br>\
security, or confidence, therein. (Msb.) The<br>\
verb is trans. by itself, and by means of the<br>\
particle مِنْ; as in أَمَنَ زَيْدٌ الأَسَدَ and أَمِنَ مِنَ<br>\
الأَسَدِ, meaning Zeyd was, or became, or felt,<br>\
secure from, safe from, [or free from fear of,]<br>\
the lion. (Msb.) You say also, أَمِنَ كَذِبَ مَنْ<br>\
أَخْبَرَهُ [He was secure from, or free from fear<br>\
of, the lying of him who informed him]. (M.)<br>\
And لَا آنَنُ أَنْ يَكُونَ كَذلِكَ [I am not free from<br>\
fear of its being so; I am not sure but that it<br>\
may be so]. (Mgh in art. نبذ; and other lexicons<br>\
passim.) And, of a strong-made she camel, أَمِنَتْ<br>\
أَنْ تَكُونَ ضَعَيفَةً [She was secure from, or free<br>\
from fear of, being weak]: (M: [in a copy of the<br>\
S أُمِنَتْ:]) and أَمِنَتِ العِثَارَ وَالإَعْيَآءٍ [She was<br>\
secure from, or free from fear of, stumbling, and<br>\
becoming jaded]: (M:) and أُمِنَ عِثَارُهَا [Her<br>\
stumbling was not feared]. (So in a copy of the<br>\
S.) And, of a highly-prized camel, أُمِنَ أَنْ يُنْحَرَ<br>\
[It was not feared that he would be slaughtered;<br>\
or his being slaughtered was not feared]. (M.)<br>\
[أَمنَهُ sometimes means He was, or became, free<br>\
from fear, though having cause for fear, of<br>\
him, or it. i. e. he thought himself secure, or safe,<br>\
from him or it. (See Kur vii. 97.)] ―<br>\
-b2-  أمِنَهُ<br>\
(inf. n. أَمْنٌ TK) [and accord. to some copies<br>\
of the K ↓ آمَنَهُ] and ↓ أمّنهُ (inf. n. تَأْمِينٌ K) and<br>\
↓ ائتمنهُ ([written with the disjunctive alif اِيتَمَنَهُ,<br>\
and] also written اِتَّمَنَهُ, on the authority of Th,<br>\
which is extr., like اِتَّهَلَ [&amp;c.], M) and ↓ استأمنهُ<br>\
all signify the same (M, K, TA) [He trusted,<br>\
or confided, in him; (as also آمن بِهِ, q. v.;) he<br>\
intrusted him with, or confided to him, power,<br>\
authority, control, or a charge; he gave him<br>\
charge over a thing or person: these meanings<br>\
are vaguely indicated in the M and K and TA.].<br>\
You say, يَأْمَنُهُ النَّاسُ وَلَا يَخَافُونَ غَائِلَتَهُ [Men, or<br>\
people, trust, or confide, in him, and do not fear<br>\
his malevolence, or mischievousness]. (T, M.) And<br>\
أَمِنَهُ عَلَى كَذَا (S, Mgh, * Msb *) and ↓ ائتمنهُ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ, (S, Msb, K,) [He trusted, or confided, in<br>\
him with respect to such a thing; he intrusted<br>\
him with, or confided to him, power, authority, control, or a charge, over it; he gave him<br>\
charge over it;] he made him, or took him<br>\
as, أَمِين over such a thing. (Mgh.) Hence, in<br>\
a trad., the مُؤَذِّن is said to be مُؤْتَمَنٌ; i. e.<br>\
النَّاسُ عَلَ الأَوْقَاتِ الَّتِى يُؤَذَّنُ فِيهَا ↓ يَأْتَمِنُهُ [Men<br>\
trust, or confide, in him with respect to the times<br>\
in which he calls to prayer], and know, by his<br>\
calling to prayer, what they are commanded to<br>\
do, as to praying and fasting and breaking fast.<br>\
(Mgh.) It is said in the Kur [xii. 11], مَا لَكَ<br>\
لَا تَأْمَنُنَا عَلَى يُوسُفَ and [تَأْمَنَّا] with idghám [i. e.<br>\
What aileth thee that thou dost not trust, or<br>\
confide, in us with respect to Joseph? or, that<br>\
thou dost not give us charge over Joseph?]; (S;)<br>\
meaning, why dost thou fear us for him? (Bd;)<br>\
some pronouncing the verb in a manner between<br>\
those of the former and the latter modes of writing<br>\
it; but Akh says that the latter is better: (S:)<br>\
some read تِيمَنَّا. (Bd.) You say also, ↓ اُوتُمِنَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ [Such a one was trusted, or confided, in<br>\
&amp;c.;] when it begins a sentence, changing the<br>\
second ء into و; in like manner as you change<br>\
it into ى when the first is with kesr, as in اِيتَمَنَهُ;<br>\
and into ا when the first is with fet-h, as in<br>\
آمَنَ. (S.) The phrase أَمَانَةً ↓ اُوتُمِنَ, in a saying<br>\
of Mohammad, if it be not correctly عَلَى أَمَانَةٍ,<br>\
may be explained as implying the meaning of<br>\
اُسْتُحْفِظَ أَمَانَةً [He was asked to take care of a<br>\
deposite; or he was intrusted with it]. (Mgh.)<br>\
[You also say, أَمِنَهُ بِكَذَا, meaning He intrusted<br>\
him with such a thing; as, for instance, money<br>\
or other property: see two exs. in the Kur iii. 68.]<br>\
-A2-  أَمُنَ, (M, Mgh, K,) or أَمِنَ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
أَمَانَةٌ, (M, Mgh, Msb,) He was, or became,<br>\
trusted in, or confided in: (M, K:) or he was,<br>\
or became, trusty, trustworthy, trustful, confidential, or faithful: said of a man. (Mgh.)<br>\
2<br>\
أمّنهُ, inf. n. تَأْمِينٌ: see 4: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also<br>\
أَمِنَهُ.<br>\
-A2-  أمّن, inf. n. as above, also signifies He<br>\
said آمِينَ or أَمِينَ, (T, S, Msb,) after finishing<br>\
the Fátihah, (T,) or عَلَي الدُّعَآءِ on the occasion of<br>\
the prayer, or supplication. (Msb.)<br>\
4<br>\
آمَنَ is originally أَأْمَنَ; the second ء being<br>\
softened. (S.) You say, آمنهُ, [inf. n. إِيمَانٌ;]<br>\
(S, M, Msb;) and ↓ أمّنهُ, [inf. n. تَأْمِينٌ;] (M,<br>\
TA;) meaning He rendered him secure, or safe;<br>\
(Msb;) he rendered him secure, or free from<br>\
fear; (S, M, TA;) contr. of أَخَافهُ: (TA:) so<br>\
in آمَنْتُهُ مِنْهُ I rendered him secure, or safe,<br>\
from him, or it. (Msb.) And of God you say,<br>\
آمَنَ عِبادَهُ مِنْ أَنْ يَظْلِمَهُمْ [He hath rendered<br>\
his servants secure from his wronging them].<br>\
(S.) And يُؤْمِنُ عِبَادَهُ مِنْ عَذَابِهِ [He rendereth<br>\
his servants secure from his punishment]. (M.)<br>\
You say also, آمَنْتُ الأَسِيرَ, meaning I gave, or<br>\
granted, الأَمَان [i. e. security or safety, or protection or safeguard, or the promise or assurance<br>\
of security or safety, or indemnity, or quarter,]<br>\
to the captive. (Msb.) And آمَنَ فُلَانٌ الَعَدُوَّ<br>\
[Such a one granted security, &amp;c., to the enemy],<br>\
inf. n. as above. (T.) It is said in the Kur ch. ix.<br>\
[verse 12], accord. to one reading, لَا إِيمَانَ لَهُمْ<br>\
They have not the attribute of granting protection;<br>\
meaning that when they grant protection, they do<br>\
not fulfil their engagement to protect. (T.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
إِيمَانٌ also signifies The believing [a thing, or in a<br>\
thing, and particularly in God]; syn. تَصْدِيقٌ;<br>\
(T, S, &amp;c.;) by common consent of the lexicologists and other men of science: (T:) its primary<br>\
meaning is the becoming true to the trust with<br>\
respect to which God has confided in one, by a<br>\
firm believing with the heart; not by profession<br>\
of belief with the tongue only, without the assent<br>\
of the heart; for he who does not firmly believe<br>\
with his heart is either a hypocrite or an ignorant<br>\
person. (T, TA.) Its verb is intrans. and trans.<br>\
(TA, from a Commentary on the Mutowwal.)<br>\
You say, آمَنَ, meaning He believed. (T.) And<br>\
it is said to be trans. by itself, like صَدَّقَ; and by<br>\
means of بِ, considered as meaning اِعْتِرَافٌ [or<br>\
acknowledgment]; and by means of لِ, considered<br>\
as meaning إِذْعَانٌ [or submission]. (TA.) [Thus]<br>\
you say, [آمنهُ and] آمن بِهِ, (inf. n. إِيمَانٌ, T, K,)<br>\
namely, a thing. (T, M.) And آمن بِاللّٰهِ He<br>\
believed in God. (T.) It seems to be meant by<br>\
what is said in the Ksh [in ii. 2], that آمن بِهِ [or<br>\
آمَنَهُ] properly signifies آمَنَهُ التَّكْذِيبَ [He rendered him secure from being charged with lying,<br>\
or falsehood]; and that the meaning he believed<br>\
him or in him, is tropical; but this is at variance<br>\
with what its author says in the A; and Es-Saad<br>\
says that this latter meaning is proper. (TA.)<br>\
The phrase in the Kur [ix. 61], وَيُؤْمِنُ لِلْمؤْمِنِينَ,<br>\
accord. to Th, means And he believeth the believers; giveth credit to them. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Sometimes<br>\
it is employed to signify The acknowledging with<br>\
the tongue only; and hence, in the Kur [lxiii. 3],<br>\
ذلِكَ بأَنَّهُمْ آمَنُوا ثُمَّ كَفَرُوا That is because they<br>\
acknowledged with the tongue, then disacknowledged with the heart. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
trusting, or confiding, or having trust or confidence. (M, K.) [You say, آمن بِهِ, meaning<br>\
He trusted, or confided, in him, or it: for] the<br>\
verb of ايمان in this sense is trans. by means of<br>\
بِ without implication; as Bd says. (TA.)<br>\
[And it is also trans. by itself: for] you say,<br>\
مَا آمَنَ أَنْ يَجِدَ صَحَابَةً, meaning (tropical:)  He trusted<br>\
not that he would find companions; (M, * K, *<br>\
TA;) said of one who has formed the intention<br>\
of journeying: or the meaning is مَا كَادَ [i. e.<br>\
he hardly, or scarcely, found &amp;c.; or he was not<br>\
near to finding &amp;c.]. (M, K.) See also أَمِنَهُ. ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
Also The manifesting humility or submission, and<br>\
the accepting the Law, (Zj, T, * K,) and that<br>\
which the Prophet has said or done, and the firm<br>\
believing thereof with the heart; (Zj, T, M;)<br>\
without which firm belief, the manifesting of<br>\
humility or submission, and the accepting that<br>\
which the Prophet has said or done, is termed<br>\
إِسْلَامٌ, for which one&#39;s blood is to be spared. (T.)<br>\
[In this sense, it is trans. by means of لِ, accord.<br>\
to some, as shown above; or by means of بِ, for,<br>\
accord. to Fei,] you say, آمَنْتُ بِاللّٰهِ, inf. n. as<br>\
above, meaning I submitted, or resigned, myself<br>\
to God. (Msb.) [There are numerous other<br>\
explanations which it is needless to give, differing<br>\
according to different persuasions. ―<br>\
-b5-  See also<br>\

10<br>\
استأمنهُ He asked, or demanded, of him<br>\

TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also أَمِنَهُ. ―<br>\
-b3-  استأمن إِلَيْهِ He entered<br>\
within the pale of his أمَان [or protection, or safeguard]. (S, Msb.)<br>\

signifies Security, or safety: (see أَمِنَ:) or]<br>\
security as meaning freedom from fear; contr.<br>\

and ↓ أَمِنٌ (M, K) and ↓ أَمَنَهُ (S, M, K) [and<br>\
↓ إِمْنَةٌ (see أَمِنَ)] and ↓ أَمَانٌ and ↓ آمِنٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
which last is an inf. n. of أَمِنَ [like the rest],<br>\
(MF,) or a subst. like فَالِجٌ; (M;) and ↓ أَمَانَةٌ is<br>\
syn. with أَمَانٌ, (S,) both of these signifying<br>\
security, or safety, and freedom from fear: (PS:)<br>\
or أَمْنٌ signifies freedom from expectation of<br>\
evil, or of an object of dislike or hatred, in the<br>\
coming time; originally, ease of mind, and freedom from fear. (El-Munáwee, TA.) You say,<br>\
أَنْتَ فِى أَمْنٍ [Thou art in a state of security],<br>\
(T, M,) مِنْ ذَاكَ [from that]; and ↓ فى أَمَانٍ<br>\
signifies the same; (T;) and so ↓ فى آمِنٍ. (M.)<br>\
And نُعَاسًا ↓ أَمَنَةً, in the Kur [iii. 148], means<br>\
Security (أَمْنًا) [and slumber]. (S.) ↓ أَمَانٌ also<br>\
signifies Protection, or safeguard: and [very<br>\
frequently] a promise, or an assurance, of security<br>\
or safety; indemnity; or quarter: in Pers. پَنَاهْ<br>\
and زِنْهَارٌ: (KL:) syn. إِلُّ. (K in art. ال.) You<br>\
say, ↓ دَخَلَ فِى أَمَانِهِ [He entered within the pale<br>\
of his protection, or safeguard]. (S, Msb.) [And<br>\
اللّٰهِ ↓ كُنٌ فِى أَمَانِ Be thou in the protection, or<br>\
safeguard, of God.] And ↓ أَعْطَيْتُهُ الأَمَانَ [I<br>\
gave, or granted, to him security or safety, or<br>\
protection or safeguard, or the promise or assurance of security or safety, or indemnity, or<br>\
quarter]; namely, a captive. (Msb.) And طَلَبَ<br>\
↓ مِنْهُ الأَمَانَ [He asked, or demanded, of him<br>\
security or safety, or protection or safeguard,<br>\
&amp;c., as in the next preceding ex.]. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  أَمْنًا in the Kur ii. 119 means ذَا أَمْن [Possessed of security or safety]: (Aboo-Is-hák, M:)<br>\
or مَوْضِعَ أَمْنٍ [a place of security or safety; like<br>\
مَأْمَنًا]. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also آمِنٌ. ―<br>\
-b4-  You say also,<br>\

إِمْنٌ: see أَمْنٌ.<br>\
أَمَنٌ: see أَمْنٌ, first and last sentences.<br>\
أَمِنٌ: see آمِنٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K, [there said to be<br>\
like كَتِفٌ,]) or ↓ آمِنٌ, (M, [so written in a copy<br>\
of that work,)] Asking, or demanding, or seeking,<br>\

from fear, for himself: (M, K:) so says IAar. (M.)<br>\

who believes in everything that he hears; who<br>\

or people, trust, or confide, and whose malevolence,<br>\
or mischievousness, they do not fear: (T, M:) and<br>\
↓ أُمَنَةٌ signifies trusted in, or confided in; [like<br>\
أَمِينٌ;] and by rule should be أُمْنَةٌ, because it has<br>\
the meaning of a pass. part. n. [like لُعْنَةٌ and<br>\
ضُحْكَةٌ and لُقْطَلةٌ &amp;c. (see لَقَطٌ)]: (M:) or both<br>\

K:) [a person in whom one trusts or confides; a<br>\
confidant; a person intrusted with, or to whom<br>\
is confided, power, authority, control, or a charge,<br>\
عَلَى شَىْءٍ over a thing; a person intrusted with<br>\

a trustee; a depositary;] a guardian: (TA:)<br>\
trusty; trustworthy; trustful; confidential;<br>\
faithful: (Mgh, Msb: *) pl. أُمَنَآءُ, and, accord.<br>\
to some, ↓ أَمَنَةٌ, as in a trad. in which it is said,<br>\

the sake of the metre), mercy on thee! or woe to<br>\
thee! that I have sworn an oath that I will not<br>\
act treacherously to him in whom I trust?] i. e.<br>\
↓ مَأْمُونِى: (S:) or the meaning here is, him who<br>\

↓ أُمَّانٌ, mentioned above, and occurring in a verse<br>\
of El-Aashà, applied to a merchant, is said by<br>\
some to mean Possessed of religion and excellence.<br>\
(M.) ↓ مُؤْتَمَنٌ is applied, in a trad., to the مُؤَذِّن,<br>\
as meaning that men trust, or confide, in him<br>\
with respect to the times in which he calls to<br>\
prayer, and know by his call what they are commanded to do as to praying and fasting and<br>\

syn. قَوِىٌّ. (K, TA: [in the latter of which is<br>\
given the same reason for this signification as is<br>\

may be a mistranscription; but see أَمُونٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
One who trusts, or confides, in another; (ISk, T,<br>\
K;) [as also ↓ آمِنٌ, of which see an ex. voce حَذِرٌ;]<br>\
so accord. to ISk in the verse cited above in this<br>\

trustworthiness; trustfulness; faithfulness; fidelity; (M, Mgh, K;) as also ↓ أَمَنَةٌ. (M, K.)<br>\
أَمَانَةُ اللّٰهِ [for أَمَانَةُ اللّٰهِ قَسَمِي or مَا أُقْسِمُ The<br>\
faithfulness of God is my oath or that by which<br>\
I swear] is composed of an inf. n. prefixed to the<br>\
agent, and the former is in the nom. case as an<br>\
inchoative; the phrase being like لَعَمْرُ اللّٰهِ, as<br>\
meaning an oath; and the enunciative being suppressed, and meant to be understood: accord. to<br>\
some, you say, أَمَانَةَ اللّٰهِ [app. for نَشَدْتُكَ أَمَانَةَ اللّٰهِ<br>\
I adjure thee, or conjure thee, by the faithfulness<br>\
of God, or the like], making it to be governed in<br>\
the accus. case by the verb which is to be understood: and some correctly say, وَأَمَانَةِ اللّٰهِ [By the<br>\
faithfulness of God], with the و which denotes<br>\
an oath: (Mgh:) or this last is an oath accord.<br>\
to Aboo-Haneefeh; but Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee does not<br>\
reckon it as such: and it is forbidden in a trad. to<br>\
swear by الأَمَانَة; app. because it is not one of<br>\
the names of God. (TA.) [Or these phrases may<br>\
have been used, in the manner of an oath, agreeably with explanations here following.]<br>\
-A2-  A<br>\
thing committed to the trust and care of a person;<br>\
a trust; a deposite; (Mgh, Msb;) and the like:<br>\

Kur [viii. 27], وَتَخُونُوا أَمَانَاتِكُمْ [Nor be ye<br>\
unfaithful to the trusts committed to you]. (Mgh.)<br>\
And in the same [xxxiii. 72], إِنَّا عَرَضْنَاالأَمَانَةَ عَلَى<br>\
السّموَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِوَالْجِبَالِ فَأَبَيْنَ أَنْ يَحْمِلْنَهَا وَأَشْفَقْنَ<br>\
مِنْهَا وَحَمَلَهَا الْإِنْسَانُ [Verily we proposed, or<br>\
offered, the trust which we have committed to<br>\
man to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, and (accord. to explanations of Bd and<br>\
others) they refused to take it upon themselves, or<br>\
to accept it, and they feared it, but man took it<br>\
upon himself, or accepted it: or, (accord. to<br>\
another explanation of Bd, also given in the T,<br>\
and in the K in art. حمل, &amp;c.,) they refused to<br>\
be unfaithful to it, and they feared it, but man<br>\
was unfaithful to it: but in explaining what this<br>\
trust was, authors greatly differ: accord. to some,]<br>\
الامانة here means obedience; so called because<br>\
the rendering thereof is incumbent: or the obedience<br>\
which includes that which is natural and that<br>\
which depends upon the will: [for] it is said that<br>\
when God created these [celestial and terrestrial]<br>\
bodies, He created in them understanding: or it<br>\
may here [and in some other instances] mean<br>\
reason, or intellect: [and the faculty of volition:<br>\
and app. conscience: these being trusts committed<br>\
to us by God, to be faithfully employed: (see an<br>\
ex. voce جَذْرٌ:)] and the imposition of a task or<br>\
duty or of tasks or duties [app. combined with<br>\
reason or intellect, which is necessary for the<br>\
performance thereof]: (Bd:) or it here means<br>\
prayers and other duties for the performance of<br>\
which there is recompense and for the neglect of<br>\
which there is punishment: (Jel:) or, accord. to<br>\
I&#39;Ab and Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Jubeyr, (T,) the obligatory<br>\
statutes which God has imposed upon his servants:<br>\
(T, K: *) or, (T, K,) accord. to Ibn-&#39;Omar, [the<br>\
choice between] obedience and disobedience was<br>\
offered to Adam, and he was informed of the<br>\
recompense of obedience and the punishment of<br>\
disobedience: but, in my opinion, he says, (T,)<br>\
it here means the intention which one holds in the<br>\
heart, (T, K,) with respect to the belief which he<br>\
professes with the tongue, and with respect to all<br>\
the obligatory statutes which he externally fulfils;<br>\
(K;) because God has confided to him power<br>\
over it, and not manifested it to any [other] of his<br>\
creatures, so that he who conceives in his mind,<br>\
with respect to the acknowledgment of the unity<br>\
of God, (T, K,) and with respect to belief [in<br>\
general], (T,) the like of that which he professes,<br>\
he fulfils the امانة [or trust], (T, K,) and he who<br>\
conceives in his mind disbelief while he professes<br>\
belief with the tongue is unfaithful thereto, and<br>\
every one who is unfaithful to that which is confided to him is [termed] حَامِلٌ, (T,) or حَامِلُ<br>\
الأَمَانَةِ, and مُحْتَمِلُهَا: (Bd:) and by الإِنْسَانُ is<br>\
here meant the doubting disbeliever. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, [as being a trust committed to him by God,<br>\
A man&#39;s] family, or household; syn. أَهْلٌ. (TA.)<br>\
أُمَّانٌ: see أَمينٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also One<br>\
who does not write; as though he were (كَأَنَّهُ [in<br>\
the CK لاَنَّهُ because he is]) an أُمِّى. (K, TA.)<br>\
[But this belongs to art. ام; being of the measure<br>\
فُعْلَانٌ, like عُرْيَانٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And A sower, or cultivator of land; [perhaps meaning a clown, or<br>\
boor;] syn. زَرَّاعٌ: (CK:) or sowers, or cultivators<br>\
of land; syn. زُرَّاعٌ: (K, TA:) in one copy of the<br>\
K زِرَاع. (TA.)<br>\
آمِنٌ Secure, safe, or free from fear; as also<br>\
↓ أَمِينٌ (Lh, T, * S, * M, Msb, K) and ↓ أَمِنٌ. (M,<br>\
K.) Hence, in the Kur [xcv. 3], ↓ وَهذَا الْبَلَدِ الْأَمِينِ<br>\
[And this secure town]; (Akh, Lh, T, S, M;)<br>\
meaning Mekkeh. (M.) بَلَدٌ آمِنٌ and ↓ أَمِينٌ<br>\
means A town, or country, or district, of which<br>\
the inhabitants are in a state of security, or confidence, therein. (Msb.) It is also said in the<br>\
Kur [xliv. 51], ↓ إِنَّ الْمُتَّقِينَ فِي مَقَامٍ أَمِينٍ,<br>\
meaning [Verily the pious shall be in an abode]<br>\
wherein they shall be secure from the accidents,<br>\
or casualties, of fortune. (M.) [And hence,]<br>\
↓ الأَمِينُ is one of the epithets applied to God,<br>\
(Mgh, K,) on the authority of El-Hasan; (Mgh;)<br>\
an assertion requiring consideration: it may mean<br>\
He who is secure with respect to the accidents, or<br>\
casualties, of fortune: but see المُؤْمِنُ, which is<br>\
[well known as] an epithet applied to God. (TA.)<br>\
آمِنُ المَالِ means What is secure from being<br>\
slaughtered, of the camels, because of its being<br>\
highly prized; by المال being meant الإِبِل: or,<br>\
as some say, (tropical:)  what is highly esteemed, of property<br>\
of any kind; as though, if it had intellect, it<br>\
would feel secure from being exchanged. (M.)<br>\
You say, أَعْطَيْتُهُ مِنْ آمِنِ مَالِي, (K, TA, [in the<br>\
CK آمَنِ,]) meaning (tropical:)  I gave him of the choice,<br>\
or best, of my property; of what was highly<br>\
esteemed thereof; (K, TA;) and مَالِى ↓ مِنْ أَمْنِ<br>\
which Az explains as meaning of the choice, or<br>\
best, of my property. (TA: [in which is given<br>\
a verse cited by ISk showing that أَمْن, thus used,<br>\
is not a mistranscription for آمِن.]) And آمِنُ الحِلْمِ<br>\
means Steadfast in forbearance or clemency; of<br>\
whose becoming disordered in temper, and free<br>\
from self-restraint, there is no fear. (M.) ―<br>\

آمِينَ [in the CK, erroneously, آمِينُ] and<br>\
↓ أَمِينَ; (Th, T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) both<br>\
chaste and well known, (TA,) the latter of the<br>\
dial. of El-Hijáz, (Msb, TA,) as some say, (TA,)<br>\
[and this, though the less common, is the original<br>\
form, for] the medd in the former is only to give<br>\
fulness of sound to the fet-hah of the أ, (Th, M,<br>\
Msb, TA,) as is shown by the fact that there<br>\
is no word in the Arabic language of the measure<br>\
فَاعِيلٌ; (Msb, TA;) and some pronounce the<br>\
former آمِّينَ, (K,) which is said by some of the<br>\
learned to be a dial. var., (Msb,) but this is a<br>\
mistake, (S, Msb,) accord. to authorities of good<br>\
repute, and is one of old date, originating from<br>\
an assertion of Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà, [i. e. Th,]<br>\
that آمِينَ is like عَاصِينَ, by which he was falsely<br>\
supposed to mean its having the form of a pl.,<br>\
[and being consequently آمِّينَ,] (Msb, [and part<br>\
of this is said in the M,]) whereas he thereby<br>\
only meant that the م is without teshdeed, like<br>\
the ص in عَاصِينَ; (M;) beside that the sense<br>\
of قَاصِدِينَ [which is that of آمِّينَ, from أَمَّ,]<br>\
would be inconsistent after the last phrase of the<br>\
first chapter of the Kur [where آمينَ is usually<br>\
added]; (Msb;) and sometimes it is pronounced<br>\
with imáleh, [i. e. “émeena,”] as is said by ElWáhidee in the Beseet; (K;) but this is unknown in works on lexicology, and is said to be<br>\
a mispronunciation of some of the Arabs of the<br>\
desert of El-Yemen: (MF:) each form is indecl.,<br>\
(S,) with fet-h for its termination, like أَيْنَ and<br>\
كَيْفَ, to prevent the occurrence of two quiescent<br>\
letters together: (T, S, TA:) it is a word used<br>\
immediately after a prayer, or supplication: (S, *<br>\
M:) [it is best expressed, when occurring in a<br>\
translation, by the familiar Hebrew equivalent<br>\
Amen:] El-Fárisee says that it is a compound<br>\
of a verb and a noun; (M;) meaning answer<br>\
Thou me; [i. e. answer Thou my prayer;] (M,<br>\
Mgh;*) or O God, answer Thou: (Zj, T, Msb,<br>\
K:) or so be it: (AHát, S, Msb, K:) or so do Thou,<br>\
(K, TA,) O Lord: (TA:) it is strangely asserted<br>\
by some of the learned, that, after the Fátihah,<br>\
[or Opening Chapter of the Kur-án,] it is a prayer<br>\
which implies all that is prayed for in detail in<br>\
the Fátihah: so in the Towsheeh: (MF:) or<br>\
it is one of the names of God: (M, Msb, K:)<br>\
so says El-Hasan (M, Msb) El-Basree: (Msb:)<br>\
but the assertion that it is for يَا اَللّٰهُ [O God],<br>\
and that اسْتَجِبٌ [answer Thou] is meant to be<br>\
understood, is not correct accord. to the lexicologists; for, were it so, it would be with refa,<br>\
not nasb. (T.)<br>\
إِيمَانٌ [inf. n. of 4, q. v. ―<br>\
-b2-  Used as a simple<br>\
subst., Belief; particularly in God, and in his<br>\
word and apostles &amp;c.: faith: trust, or confidence: &amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Sometimes it means Prayer;<br>\
syn. صَلَاةٌ: as in the Kur [ii. 138], where it is<br>\
said, وَمَا كَانَ اللّٰهُ لِيُضِيعَ إِيَمانَكُمْ, (Bd, Jel, TA,)<br>\
i. e. [God will not make to be lost] your prayer<br>\
towards Jerusalem, (Bd, * Jel,) as some explain<br>\
it. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Sometimes, also, it is used as meaning The law brought by the Prophet. (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
مَأْمَنٌ A place of security or safety or freedom<br>\
from fear; or where one feels secure. (M, TA.)<br>\
مُؤْمَنٌ pass. part. n. of آمَنَهُ. (T.) It is said<br>\
in the Kur [iv. 96], accord. to one reading, (T,<br>\
M,) that of Aboo-Jaafar El-Medenee, (T,) لَسْتَ<br>\
مُؤْمَنًا [Thou art not granted security, or safety,<br>\
&amp;c.; or] we will not grant thee security, &amp;c.<br>\
(T, M.)<br>\
مُؤْمِنٌ [act. part. n. of 4; Rendering secure,<br>\
&amp;c.]. المُؤْمِنُ is an epithet applied to God;<br>\
meaning He who rendereth mankind secure from<br>\
his wronging them: (T, S:) or He who rendereth<br>\
his servants secure from his punishment: (M,<br>\
IAth:) i. q. المُهَيْمِنُ, (M,) which is originally<br>\
المُؤَأْمِنُ; [for the form مُفْعِلٌ is originally مُؤَفْعِلٌ;]<br>\
the second ء being softened, and changed into ى,<br>\
and the first being changed into ه: (S:) or the<br>\
Believer of his servants (Th, M, TA) the Muslims,<br>\
on the day of resurrection, when the nations shall<br>\
be interrogated respecting the messages of their<br>\
apostles: (TA:) or He who will faithfully perform to his servants what He hath promised<br>\
them: (T, TA:) or He who hath declared in his<br>\
word the truth of his unity. (T.) ―<br>\
