أَرَتِ الدَّابَّةُ مَرْبَطَهَا, (M, K,) and مِعْلَفَهَا, [aor.<br>\
تَأْرِى,] inf. n. أَرْىٌ, (M,) The beast kept to its<br>\
place where it was tied, (M, K,) and to its manger. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَرَتِ الدَّابِّةُ إِلَى الدَّابَّةِ, (K,) aor.<br>\
as above, (S,) and so the inf. n., (TA,) The<br>\
beast joined itself, or became joined, to the beast,<br>\

أَرَّيْتُ لِلدَّابَّةِ, (S, M, K,) and الدَّابَّةَ, (M, K,)<br>\
inf. n. تأْرِيَةٌ, (S, M, K,) I made for the beast an<br>\
آرِىّ [q. v.], (S, * M,) or an آرِيَّة. (K: [in the<br>\
CK اَرِيَّة; but this and آرِيَّة are probably mistakes<br>\
of copyists.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَرَّىَ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. as above, He<br>\
rendered the thing permanent, or steadfast; confirmed it; established it. (M, K.) Hence, in<br>\
a trad., اَللٰهُمَّ أَرِّمَا بَيْنَهُمْ, i. e. O God, make permanent, or confirm, or establish, what is between<br>\
them, of love, or affection; said in praying for<br>\
a man and his wife. (M, TA.) Mohammad is<br>\
also related to have said, with this intention,<br>\
اَللٰهُمَّ أَرِّبَيْنَهُمَا, meaning O God, render permanent,<br>\
or confirm, the union, or concord, or love, of them<br>\
tow; (A&#39;Obeyd, TA;) or cause union to subsist,<br>\
and render permanent, or confirm, love, or affection, between them two: (IAth, TA:) or اَللٰهُمَّ<br>\
أَرِّ كُلَّ وَاحِدٍ مِنْهُمَا صَاحِبَهُ, meaning O God, confine each of them two to the other, so that the<br>\
heart of neither may become turned away to any<br>\
but that other: the correct form of speech, however, is عَلَي صَاحِبِهِ, unless it be like تَعَلَّقْتُ فُلَانًا<br>\
for تعلّقت بِفُلَانٍ. (IAmb, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
آرَيْتُ الدَّابَّةَ I joined the beast to another<br>\
beast, and made it to keep with the other to one<br>\
manger: (S, in the present art.; and K:) or<br>\
آرَيْتُ الدَّابَّتَيْنِ I joined the two beasts together,<br>\
and made them both keep to one manger. (So<br>\
accord. to the S in art. وأر.)<br>\

تأري بِالمَكَانِ He remained, stayed, or abode,<br>\
in the place: (S, Mgh, Msb:) or he became confined, or he confined himself, therein; (T, M, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ ائتري [written with the disjunctive alif<br>\
اِيتَرَى]. (M, K.) ―<br>\

فَاعُولٌ, (T, S, Mgh, Msb,) from تَأَرَّى بِالمَكَانِ as<br>\
explained above, (Mgh,) or hence this verb,<br>\
(Msb,) and ↓ أَرِىٌّ, (M, K, * [but accord. to the<br>\
latter, the second form may be either thus (as it<br>\
is written in the M) or ↓ آرٍ, (agreeably with the<br>\
latter of the two pls. mentioned below,) for the<br>\
two forms are there expressed by الآرِىُّ وَ يُخَفَّفُ,<br>\
(in the CK, erroneously, الاَرىُّ و يُخَفَّفُ,) and in<br>\
another place in the K we find it written ↓ آرِيَّة,<br>\
or, as in the CK, ↓ اَرِيَّة,]) The place of confinement of a beast: (ISk, T, S:) or i. q. آخِيَّةٌ; (M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) used in this sense by the Arabs;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,;) or sometimes having this application; meaning a rope to which a beast is tied in<br>\
its place of confinement;; (S;) or a loop of a rope<br>\
to which a beast is tied in that place: (Mgh:) so<br>\

S,) by the vulgar, and by the lawyers, (Mgh,)<br>\
applied to a manger::(ISk, T, S, Mgh, Msb:) pl.<br>\
أَوَارِىُّ (T, S, Mgh, Msb) and أَوَارٍ (S.)<br>\
-A2-  Hence,<br>\
أَوَارِىُّ is metaphorically applied to (tropical:) The places<br>\
(أَحْيَاز) that are made, in shops, for grain and<br>\
other things: and to (tropical:)  the water-tanks, or troughs,<br>\
in a bath. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A3-  El-&#39;Ajjáj says, describing a<br>\
[wild] bull, and his covert,<br>\
وَاعْتَادَ أَرْبَاضَّا لَهَا آرِىُّ<br>\
meaning [And he frequented lodging-places]<br>\
having a firm foundation for the quiet of the<br>\
wild animals therein [as having been from the<br>\
first occupied by such animals and unfrequented<br>\
by men]. (S.)— آرِىُّ is also said to signify<br>\
Land of a kind between even and rugged. (M.)<br>\
آرِيَّةٌ: see آرِىٌّ.<br>\
