&amp;c.:) or, accord. to some, it is a conjunct noun,<br>\
and this is the correct opinion; but some say it<br>\
is a conjunct particle; and some, a particle of<br>\
determination: (I &#39;AK p. 40:) [it is equivalent to<br>\
our article The;] as in الرَّجُلُ [The man]: (S and<br>\
K in art. لوم, and I &#39;Ak p. 48:) accord. to Kh,<br>\
[what is termed] the determinative is اَلْ [altogether, and therefore it is called by some “the<br>\
determinative alif and lám“]; but accord. to Sb,<br>\
it is the ل alone; [wherefore it is called by some,<br>\
as in the S &amp;c., “the lám of determination;”;] so<br>\
that accord. to Kh, the hemzeh is a hemzeh of<br>\
disjunction; but accord. to Sb, it is a hemzeh of<br>\
conjunction: (I &#39;Ak ubi suprà:) [J says,] the<br>\
ل being quiescent, the conjunctive ا is prefixed to<br>\
it in order that it may commence therewith; but<br>\
when it is conjoined with what precedes it, the ا is<br>\
dropped, as in لِلرَّجُلِ. (S in art. لوم.) Sometimes<br>\
the Arabs suppress hemzeh after it; and sometimes<br>\
they also suppress the ا of the article itself: thus,<br>\
for الأَحْمَرُ, they say الَحْمَرُ, and لَحْمَرُ. (Zj, cited<br>\
in TA in art. ايك.) In the dial. of some of the<br>\
people of El-Yemen, (TA in art. ام, q. v.,) or in<br>\
the dial. of Himyer, (TA in art. طيب,) امْ is<br>\
used in the sense of ال. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is used to<br>\
distinguish a noun as known [to the hearer or<br>\
reader in a particular and definite sense]: (Mughnee, I &#39;Ak ubi suprà:) first, by its being mentioned [before]; (Mughnee;) as in [the words of<br>\
the Kur lxxiii. 15 and 16,] كَمَ أَرْسَلْنَا إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ<br>\
رَسُولًا فَعَصَى فِرْعَوْنُ الرَّسُولَ [Like as we sent unto<br>\
Pharaoh an apostle, and Pharaoh disobeyed the<br>\
apostle]; (Mughnee, I &#39;Ak;) in which case, the<br>\
pronoun may supply the place which it and the<br>\
noun that it accompanies occupies: secondly, by<br>\
its being conceived in the mind; as in [the Kur<br>\
ix. 40,] إِذْ هُمَا فِى الغَارِ [When they two were in<br>\
the cave]: and thirdly, by its being applied to a<br>\
thing present; and accord. to Ibn-&#39;Osfoor, this<br>\
does not occur except after nouns of indication, as<br>\
in جَآءَ نِى هٰذَا الرَّجُلُ [This man (lit. this, the<br>\
man,) came to me]; or after أَىّ in calling, as in<br>\
يَا أَيُّهَا الرَّجُلُ [O man]; or after إِذَا denoting a<br>\
thing&#39;s happening suddenly, or unexpectedly, as<br>\
in خَرَجْتُ فَإِذَا الأَسَدُ [I went forth, and lo, there<br>\
was the lion]; or after the noun denoting the<br>\
present time, as اَلْآنَ [Now]: but this requires<br>\
consideration; for you say to the reviler of a man<br>\
in you presence, لَا تَشْتِمِ الرَّجُلَ [Revile not thou<br>\
the man]; and because that which is after إِذَا does<br>\
not render determinate anything present at the<br>\
time of speaking; and because that in الآن is<br>\
really redundant, being inseparable, which the<br>\
determinative is never known to be: the good<br>\
example in this case is the saying in the Kur<br>\
[v. 5], اَلْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِيْنَكُمْ [This day I have<br>\
completed for you your religion]. (Mughnee.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  It is also used to denote the species: first, to<br>\
denote the totality of the individuals of the species;<br>\
and this may have its place supplied by كُلّ used<br>\
in its proper sense; (Mughnee, I &#39;Ak * ubi suprà;)<br>\
as in [the Kur iv. 32,] وَخُلِقَ الإِنْسَانُ ضَعِيفًا [For<br>\
man was created weak]: secondly, to denote the<br>\
totality of the properties of the individuals, or the<br>\
combination of all those properties in one thing;<br>\
and this may have its place supplied by كُلّ used<br>\
in a tropical sense; as in زَيْدٌ الرَّجُلُ عِلْمًا [Zeyd<br>\
is the man in respect of knowledge; as though he<br>\
combined in himself the knowledge of all the<br>\
individuals of his species]; i. e., he is the complete, or perfect, [or we would rather say,<br>\
preeminent,] in knowledge; and hence, [in the<br>\
Kur ii. 1,] ذٰلِكَ الكِتَابُ [That is the book, or<br>\
scripture; as though combining in itself the<br>\
excellences of all other books or scriptures; or<br>\
meaning that is preeminently the book, or scripture]: and thirdly, to denote the quiddity, or<br>\
essence; and this may not have its place supplied<br>\
by كُلّ used either properly or tropically; as in<br>\
the saying, [in the Kur xxi. 31,] وَجَعَلْنَا مِنَ المَآءِ<br>\
كُلَّ شَىْءٍ حَىٍّ [And we have made of water<br>\
(meaning, accord. to common opinion, sperma<br>\
genitale,) everything living]; or, accord. to some,<br>\
it is used in this case to distinguish a thing as<br>\
known [in a particular sense] by its being conceived in the mind. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It is also<br>\
used to denote predominance of application; as<br>\
in المَدِينَةُ [The city], meaning the city of the<br>\
Apostle; and الكِتَابُ [The book], meaning the<br>\
book of Seebaweyh: and in this case, it may not<br>\
be suppressed, except when the noun is used<br>\
vocatively, or when it is prefixed to another noun<br>\
which it governs in the gen. case; and in some<br>\
anomalous instances, as in هٰذَا عَيُّوقٌ طَالِعًا [This<br>\
is the star Capella, rising], originally العَيُّوقٌ.<br>\
(I &#39;Ak p. 51.) [In a case of this kind, it is said<br>\
in the Mughnee to be redundant; but I think it<br>\
is clearly not so in any of the instances here<br>\
mentioned, except the last; and this I would<br>\
rather assign to a category yet to be noticed, in<br>\
which ال is certainly redundant, and, by rule,<br>\
inseparable.] ―<br>\
-b5-  It is also prefixed to a noun<br>\
transferred from its original application to that of<br>\
a proper name; it being so prefixed to convey an<br>\
allusion to the original signification; and such<br>\
noun being generally an epithet, as حَارِثٌ; but<br>\
sometimes an inf. n., as فَضْلٌ; and sometimes a<br>\
generic noun, as نُعْمَانٌ; so that in any of these<br>\
cases you may prefix ال, saying الحَارِثُ and<br>\
الفَضْلُ and النُّعْمَانُ, with a view to the original<br>\
signification; and you may suppress it, with a<br>\
view to the actual state [which is that of a proper<br>\
name]: for when you mean that a name of this<br>\
kind is given as one ominous of good, you prefix<br>\
the ال in order to indicate this; as when you say<br>\
الحَارِثُ with a view to a person&#39;s being thus<br>\
named to prognosticate that he will live and be a<br>\
tiller, or cultivator; but when you only consider<br>\
it as a proper name, you do not prefix the ال:<br>\
thus the prefix ال conveys a meaning not obtained<br>\
without it; and therefore it is not redundant, as<br>\
some assert it to be. (I &#39;Ak p. 50.) [The author<br>\
of the Mughnee is one of those who consider ال<br>\
redundant in this case.] ―<br>\
-b6-  It is in some cases<br>\
redundant: and in some of these, it is inseparable;<br>\
as in [a proper name which cannot be used with a<br>\
view to an original application from which it has<br>\
been transferred to that of a proper name though<br>\
it may have been so transferred, such as] اللَّاتُ,<br>\
which is the name of a certain idol that was at<br>\
Mekkeh [so called because a man used to moisten<br>\
سَوِيق with clarified butter, for the pilgrims, at the<br>\
place thereof]; and, accord. to some, [as before<br>\
mentioned,] in الآنِ; and in the conjunct nouns<br>\
الَّذِى and its variations, accord. to those who hold<br>\
that a noun of this kind is rendered determinate<br>\
by its complement: in other cases, where it is<br>\
redundant, it is separable; and this is when it is<br>\
prefixed to a proper name by poetic licence, as in<br>\
بَنَاتُ الأَوْبَرِ for بَنَاتُ أَوْبَرَ, a species of truffle; or,<br>\
accord. to Mbr, this is not a proper name, and<br>\
the ال is not redundant; and when it is prefixed<br>\
to a specificative, as in طِبْتَ النَّفْسَ for طِبْتَ نَفْسًا,<br>\
accord. to the Basrees, who hold, in opposition to<br>\
the Koofees, that the specificative may only be<br>\
indeterminate; (I &#39;Ak p. 49;) [and, in like manner, as redundant and separable,] it is irregularly<br>\
prefixed [by poetic licence] in الأَمْسِ [q. v.],<br>\
when it is left in its original form with kesr.<br>\
(T.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Accord. to the Koofees, and some of the<br>\
Basrees, and many of the later authors, it may<br>\
also supply the place of the affixed pronoun; and<br>\
such they hold to be the case in the saying in the<br>\
Kur [lxxix. 41], فَإِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ هِىَ الْمَأوِى [Verily<br>\
Paradise, it shall be his place of abode]; and in<br>\
مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ حَسَنٍ الوَجْهُ [I passed by a man<br>\
beautiful in his face]; and ضُرِبَ زَيْدٌ الظَّهْرُ وَالبَطْنُ<br>\
[Zeyd was beaten, his back and his belly]; when<br>\
الوجه and الظهر and البطن are thus in the nom.<br>\
case: but those who deny its being used in this<br>\
manner hold that لَهُ is to be understood in the<br>\
verse of the Kur, and مِنْهُ in the other examples:<br>\
and Ibn-Málik restricts the licence to cases not<br>\
including the صِلَة [or complement of ال used in<br>\
the manner which is here next to be explained].<br>\
(Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b8-  It is also a conjunct noun in the<br>\
sense of الَّذِى and its variations; and as such is<br>\
prefixed to an act. part. n., and to a pass. part. n.,<br>\
and, as some say, to a simple epithet; (Mughnee,<br>\
and I&#39; Ak p. 43;) as الضَّارِبُ [which is equivalent<br>\
to الَّذِى يَضْرِبُ], and المَضْرُوبُ [which is equivalent<br>\
to الَّذِى ضُرِبَ], and الحَسَنُ الوَجْهِ: (I &#39;Ak:) but<br>\
this last not to be regarded, as it cannot be<br>\
rendered by means of a verb. (Mughnee.) As<br>\
such, also, it is sometimes prefixed to an adverbial<br>\
noun, (Mughnee and I &#39;Ak,) extraordinarily;<br>\
(I &#39;Ak;) as in the saying,<br>\
مَنْ لَا يَزَالُ شَاكِرًا عَلَى يلْمَعَهْ<br>\
فَهْوَ حَرٍ بِعِيشَةٍ ذَاتِ سَعَهْ<br>\
[Whoso ceases not to be grateful, or thankful, for<br>\
what is with him, or what he has, he is worthy of<br>\
a state of life such as is attended with plenty.]<br>\
(Mughnee and I &#39;Ak.) As such it is also sometimes prefixed to a nominal proposition; as in the<br>\
saying,<br>\
مَنَ القَوْمِ الرَّسُولُ اللّٰهِ مِنْهُمْ<br>\
لَهُمْ دَانَتْ رِقَابُ بِنَي مَعَدِّ<br>\
[Of the people of whom is the apostle of God, of<br>\
those to whom the necks of the sons of Ma&#39; add<br>\
have become abased]. (Mughnee and I &#39;Ak.)<br>\
And as such it is also sometimes prefixed to a<br>\
verbal proposition, of which the verb is an aor.;<br>\
which shows that it is not [in this case] a particle<br>\
of determination; (Mughnee;) as in the phrase,<br>\
صَوْتُ الحِمَارِ اليُجَدَّعُ [The voice of the ass that<br>\
has his ear, or ears, cut off]. (T and Mughnee.)<br>\
But all these three cases are peculiar to poetry;<br>\
contrary to the opinion of Akh, and, with respect<br>\
to the last case, to that of Ibn-Málik. (Mughnee.)<br>\
[Respecting the last instance, see also art. جدع.]<br>\
Another instance of its usage prefixed in this sense<br>\
to an aor. is the saying,<br>\
مَا أَنْتَ بِالْحَكَمَ التُرْضَى حُكُومَتُهُ<br>\
[Thou art not the judge whose judgment is approved]; (IAmb, T, I &#39;Ak) a saying of ElFarezdak: (IAmb, T:) it is an extraordinary<br>\
case; (I &#39;Ak;) and is [said to be] an instance of<br>\
a bad poetic license, the like of which in prose<br>\
would be an error by common consent. (Expos.<br>\
of the Shudhoor edh-Dhahab.) In like manner,<br>\
one says, accord. to AZ, هٰذَا اليَضْرِبُكَ, meaning<br>\
This is he who beats thee; and رَأَيْتُ اليَضْرِبُكَ I<br>\
saw him who beats thee; and هٰذَا الوُضِعَ لِلشِّعْرِ<br>\
This is what is appropriated to poetry. (T: [in<br>\
which this last ex. is perhaps intended to intimate<br>\
that the prefixing of ال in this manner to a verb<br>\
is allowable only in poetry.]) ―<br>\
-b9-  The Arabs also<br>\
say, هَوَ الحَصِينُ أَنْ يُرَامَ وَ هُوَ العَزِيزُ أَنْ يُضَامَ,<br>\
meaning أَحْصَنُ مِنْ أَنْ يُرَام وَأَعَزُّ مِنْ ذَنْ يُضَام<br>\
[He is more strongly fortified, or protected<br>\
against attack, than that he will be sought, or<br>\
desired, and he is more mighty than that he will<br>\
be injured; i. e., too strongly fortified, or protected against attack, to be sought, or desired,<br>\
and too mighty to be injured: see مِن.] (TA in<br>\
art. لوم. [But الحِصْنُ is there erroneously put<br>\
for الحَصِينُ.])<br>\
-A2-  Among strange usages, is that<br>\
of أَلْ as an interrogative, mentioned by Ktr; as<br>\
in أَلْ فَعَلْتَ in the sense of هَلْ فَعَلْتَ [Didst thou<br>\
do? or hast thou done?]. (Mughnee.)<br>\
إِلٌّ Anything which has a quality requiring<br>\
it to be regarded as sacred, or inviolable; which<br>\
has some right pertaining to it: and thus used<br>\
in particular senses here following. (R, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Relationship; or nearness with respect to kindred;<br>\
(Fr, T, S, M, R, K;) as also ↓ إِلَّةٌ, (Fr, T, K,) of<br>\
which the pl. is إِلَلٌ. (K.) So in the Kur [ix. 8],<br>\
لَا يَرْقُبُوا فِيكُمْ إِلَّا (Fr, T) They will not regard,<br>\
with respect to you, relationship; (Bd, Jel;)<br>\
accord. to some. (Bd.) And so in a trad. of<br>\
&#39;Alee, يَخُونُ العَهْدَ وَ يَقْطَعُ الإِلَّ [He is unfaithful<br>\
to the covenant, and cuts the tie of relationship].<br>\
(TA.) Hassán Ibn-Thábit says,<br>\
لَعَمْرُكَ إِنَّ إِلَّكَ مِنْ قُرَيْشٍ<br>\
كَإِلِّ السَّقْبِ مِنْ رَأْلِ النَّعَامِ<br>\
[By thy life, thy relationship to Kureysh is like<br>\
the relationship of the young camel to the young<br>\
of the ostrich]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Good origin. (K.) So,<br>\
accord. to some, in a saying of Aboo-Bekr, which<br>\
see below. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  I. q. مَعْدِنٌ, (K,) or مَعْدِنٌ<br>\
صَحِيحٌ [as meaning A place, or person, whence<br>\
a thing, or person, originates, free from imperfection, or from everything that would induce<br>\
doubt or suspicion or evil opinion]. (El-Muärrij,<br>\
TA: [in which the verse of Hassán cited above<br>\
is given as an ex. of this signification.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  A<br>\
compact, or covenant; or one by which a person<br>\
becomes responsible for the safety, or safe-keeping,<br>\
of a person or thing; syn. عَهْدٌ: (AO, Aboo-Is-<br>\
hák, T, S, M, R, K:) a confederacy, or league;<br>\
syn. حِلْفٌ; (Aboo-Is-hák, T, M, K;) and so,<br>\
accord. to some, in the Kur ubi suprà: (Bd:)<br>\
a covenant between two parties by which either<br>\
is bound to protect the other; syn. جُوَارٌ: (Aboo-Is-hák, T, R:) a promise, or an assurance, of<br>\
security or safety; or indemnity; syn. أَمَانٌ;<br>\
(K;) a meaning which it has, accord. to some,<br>\
in the verse of the Kur cited above. (TA.)<br>\
Hence, وَفِىُّ الإِلِ A fulfiller, performer, or keeper,<br>\
of the compact, or covenant. (TA, from a trad.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  Lordship; syn. رُبُوبِيَّةٌ. (M, K.) So in the<br>\
Kur ubi suprà, accord. to some. (Bd.) And so<br>\
in the saying of Aboo-Bekr, above referred to,<br>\
when he heard the rhyming prose of Museylimeh,<br>\
هٰذَا كَلَامٌ لَمْ يَخْرُجْ مِنْ إِلٍّ [This is language<br>\
which did not proceed from lordship]: so explained by A &#39;Obeyd: (Suh, TA:) or it has here<br>\
another signification, mentioned before; the meaning being, which did not come from the origin<br>\
whence came the Kur-án: or, accord. to some, it<br>\
has here the signification next following. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
Revelation, or inspiration. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  الإِلُّ also<br>\
signifies God: [like the word<br>\
אֵל or rather<br>\
165 as used in Hebrew:] (T, S, M, K:) so<br>\
say Mujáhid and Esh-Shaabee: (T:) and so<br>\
it is said to signify in the verse of the Kur<br>\
cited above: (T, TA:) [and so it seems<br>\
to signify in the saying of Aboo-Bekr, also<br>\
cited above, accord. to the M:] but Aboo-Is-<br>\
hák disallows this; and so does Suh, in the<br>\
R. (TA.) Ibn-El-Kelbee says, (M,) when<br>\
إِلُّ ends any name, it has this meaning, and is<br>\
the complement of a prefixed noun; and so إِيلُ;<br>\
(M, K;) as in جَبْرَئِلُّ [and جَبْرَئِيلُ &amp;c.]; and<br>\
so say most of the learned: (TA:) but this is<br>\
not a valid assertion; for were it so, جَبْرَئِلُّ and<br>\
the like would be perfectly decl.: (M:) some<br>\
say that these names are constructed inversely,<br>\
after the manner of the language of the &#39;Ajam;<br>\
ال and ايل meaning servant, and the first part<br>\
of the name being a name of God. (Suh, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  I. q. شَخْصٌ [used in a pl. sense]. (Mughnee<br>\
in art. إِلَّا. [See what is said to be an ex. of<br>\
this meaning in a verse of Dhu-r-Rummeh cited<br>\
in art. الا in the present work.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is said<br>\
that] إِلٌّ is also syn. with جَارٌ [A neighbour; &amp;c.].<br>\
(K: [and so, accord. to the TA, in the M; but<br>\
I have consulted the M without finding this<br>\
explanation, and think it to be probably a mistranscription for جُوَارٌ, (see above,) as in the T<br>\
and R.])<br>\
إِلَّةٌ: see إِلٌّ.<br>\
أَمْرٌ إِلَّىٌّ A thing, or an affair, relating, or<br>\
attributable, to الإِل, meaning either God, or<br>\
revelation or inspiration. (TA.)<br>\
' } );
