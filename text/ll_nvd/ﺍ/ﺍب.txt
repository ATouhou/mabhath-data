أَبَّ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
اَبِ3َ, (M, K,) agreeably with analogy in the case of an intrans. verb<br>\
of this class, (TA,) and<br>\
اَبُ3َ, (AZ, T, S, M, K,)<br>\
contr. to analogy, (TA,) inf. n. أَبٌّ (T, S, M, K)<br>\
and أَبِيبٌ (M, K) and أَبَابٌ and أَبَابَةٌ (S, M, K)<br>\
and إِبَابَةٌ; (M;) and ↓ ائْتَبَّ [written with the disjunctive alif اِيتَبَّ]; (T, K;) He prepared himself, (AZ, S, M, A, K,) and equipped himself,<br>\
(AZ, S, A,) for (لِ) departing, or going away,<br>\
(AZ, S,) or for journeying: (M, A, K:) or he<br>\
determined upon journeying, and prepared himself. (T.) El-Aashà says,<br>\
صَرَمْتُ وَلَمْ أَصْرِمْكُمُ وَكَصَارِمٍ<br>\
أَخٌ قَدْ طَوَى كَشْحًا وَأَبَّ لِيَذْهَبَا<br>\
(T, S, M, TA,) i. e. I cut [in effect, while I did<br>\
not really cut]  you: for like one who cuts is a<br>\
brother who has determined and prepared to go<br>\
away. (TA.) [Hence,] لَا عَبَابَ وَ لَا أَبَابَ, [or<br>\
لا عَبَابِ ولا أَبَابِ,] a prov. [which see explained in<br>\
art. عب]. (TA.) [And hence the saying,] هُوَ فِى<br>\
أَبَابِهِ, (S, M, K,) and أَبَابَتِهِ, and إِبَابَتِهِ, (M,) He<br>\
is in his [state of, or he is engaged in his,] preparation or equipment [for departing or journeying]. (S, M, K.) The hemzeh in أَبَّ is sometimes<br>\
changed into و; and thus وَبَّ, inf. n. وَبٌّ, signifies He prepared himself to assault, or charge, in<br>\
battle. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَبَّتْ أَبَابَتُهُ, and إِبَابَتُهُ, His<br>\
way, or course, of acting, or conduct, or the like,<br>\
was, or became, rightly directed, or ordered. (M,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ↓ أَبَّ أَبَّهُ i. q. قَصَدَ قَصْدَهُ, (K,) which signifies He tended, repaired, betook himself, or directed his course, towards him, or it: (S and Msb<br>\
in art. قصد:) and also, he pursued his (another‘s)<br>\
course, doing as he (the latter) did. (L in art.<br>\
وكد.) ―<br>\

extr. form; (IAar, M;) from أَبٌّ, a dial. var. of<br>\
أَبٌ: (TA:) regularly, اِسْتَأْبَاهُ. (M.) And استأبّ<br>\
أَبًا and اِسْتَأْبَبَ أَبًا He adopted a father. (TA in<br>\
art. ابو.)<br>\
أَبٌ: see art. ابو.<br>\
أَبٌّ Herbage, (M, K,) whether fresh or dry:<br>\
(M, * K, * TA:) or pasture, or herbage which<br>\
beasts feed upon, (Fr, AHn, Zj, T, S, M, A,<br>\
Msb, K,) of whatever kind, (AHn, Zj,) [or]<br>\
not sown by men: (Msb:) it is, to cattle and<br>\
other beasts, what fruit is to men: (Mujáhid,<br>\
T, Msb:) or whatever grows upon the face of<br>\
the earth; (Atà, Th, T, M;) whatever vegetable the earth produces: (K, * TA:) and also,<br>\
green herbage, or plants: (K, * TA:) and, as<br>\
some say, straw, (Jel in lxxx. 31, and TA,) because cattle eat it: (TA:) or herbage prepared<br>\
for pasture and for cutting: (TA:) accord. to<br>\
IF, (Msb,) dried fruits; because prepared for<br>\
winter (Bd in lxxx. 31, and Msb) and for journeying: (Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَوُبٌّ, originally<br>\
أَأْبُبٌ. (I&#39; Ak p. 367.) You say, فُلَانٌ رَاعَ لَهُ الحَبُّ<br>\
وَطَاعَ لَهُ الأَبُّ, meaning Such a one&#39;s seed-produce<br>\
[or grain] increased, and his pasture became<br>\
ample. (A.)<br>\

إِبَّانٌ The time, or season, of a thing: (Msb:)<br>\
or the time of preparing, or making ready, of<br>\
a thing: (Mgh:) as, for instance, of fruit: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) it is of the measure فِعْلَانٌ, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
from أَبَّ in the first of the senses assigned to it<br>\
above, (Mgh,) the ن being augmentative; (Msb;)<br>\
or of the measure فِعَّالٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) from أَبَّنَ<br>\
“he watched” or “observed” a thing, (Mgh,)<br>\
the ن being radical: (Msb:) but the former<br>\
derivation is the more correct. (Mgh.) [See also<br>\
art. ابن.]<br>\
