for the worse: (Th:) and in the Iktitáf occurs<br>\
أَجَنَ, aor.<br>\
اَجَنَ, which is unknown, but may be a<br>\
mixture of two dial. vars. [namely of أَجَنَ having<br>\
for its aor.<br>\
اَجِنَ and<br>\
اَجُنَ, and يَأْجَنُ having for its pret.<br>\
أَجِنَ]. (MF)<br>\

washed; (Msb;) a [vessel also called] مِرْكَن,<br>\
resembling a لَقَن [which is a kind of basin], in<br>\
which clothes are washed: (Mgh:) or what is<br>\
called in Persian پنگان [i. e. پِنْگانْ a small cup]:<br>\
(PS:) [it probably received this last meaning,<br>\
and some others, in post-classical times: Golius<br>\
explains it as meaning “ lagena, phiala, crater: ”<br>\
adding, “hinc vulgo Fingiána [i. e. فِنْجَانَة] calix<br>\
vocatur: item Urceus: hydria: [referring to<br>\
John ii. 6:] Vas dimidiœ seriœ simile, in quo<br>\
aqua et similia ponuntur: ” on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof: and, on the same authority, “Labrum<br>\
seu vas lapideum instar pelvis, in quo lavantur<br>\
vestes: ”] pl. أَجَاجِينُ: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) meaning [also] what resemble troughs, surrounding<br>\
trees. (Msb.)<br>\

in taste and colour, (S, Mgh, K,) from some such<br>\
cause as long standing, (TA,) but still drinkable:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) or altered for the worse in its<br>\
odour by oldness: or covered with [the green<br>\
substance called] طُحْلُب and with leaves: (Mgh:)<br>\
pl. أُجُونٌ; thought by ISd to be pl. of أَجْنٌ and<br>\
آجِنٌ. (TA.)<br>\
إِنْجَانَةٌ: see إِجَّانَةٌ.<br>\
إِيجَانَةٌ: see إِجَّانَةٌ.<br>\
مِئْجَنَةٌ [in Golius&#39;s Lex. مِئْجَنٌ] The instrument<br>\
for beating used by the قَصَّار [or whitener of cloth,<br>\
