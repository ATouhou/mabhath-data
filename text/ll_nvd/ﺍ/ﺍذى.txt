أَذِىَ, aor.<br>\
اَذَىَ, inf. n. أَذًى, (T, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
in [some of] the copies of the K written أَذًا, and<br>\
so by IB, (TA,) and أَذَآءٌ, (CK, [but not found<br>\
by me in any MS. copy of the K nor in any other<br>\
lexicon,]) and, accord. to IB, أَذَاةٌ and أَذِيَّةٌ,<br>\
(TA,) or these two are simple substs.; (M, K;)<br>\
and ↓ تأذّى; (T, S, M, Msb, K;) [He was, or<br>\
became, annoyed, molested, harmed, or hurt;]<br>\
he experienced, or suffered, slight evil, [i. e.,<br>\
annoyance, molestation, harm, or hurt,] less than<br>\
what is termed ضَرَر; (El-Khattábee;) or he<br>\
experienced, or suffered, what was disagreeable,<br>\
or hateful, or evil, (Msb, K,) in a small degree;<br>\
(K;) بِهِ [by him, or it]; (T, S, M, K;) [and<br>\
مِنْهُ from him, or it:] ↓ التَّأَذِّى signifies the being<br>\
affected by what is termed الأَذَى [i. e. what<br>\
annoys, molests, harms, or hurts, one]: and also<br>\
the showing the effect thereof; which is forbidden<br>\
by the saying of &#39;Omar, بِالنَّاسِ ↓ إِيَّاكَ وَالتَّأَذِّى<br>\
[Avoid thou, or beware thou of, showing the<br>\
being annoyed, molested, harmed, or hurt, by<br>\
men]; for this is what is within one&#39;s power.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, aor. and inf. n. as above, It<br>\
(a thing) was unclean, dirty, or filthy. (Msb.)<br>\
4<br>\
آذى signifies فَعَلَ الأَذَى [He did what<br>\
annoyed, molested, harmed, or hurt]. (M, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And آذِاهُ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) aor. يُؤْذِيهِ, (S,)<br>\
inf. n. إِيذَآءٌ (T, IB, Msb) and [quasi-inf. n.]<br>\
أَذِيَّةٌ, (T,) or أَذَّى and أَذَاةٌ and أَذِيَّةٌ, (S, K,) but<br>\
IB refuses his assent to this, saying that these<br>\
three are inf. ns. of أَذِىَ, and MF says of إِيذَآءٌ,<br>\
which is expressly disallowed by the author of<br>\
the K, though he himself uses it, that others<br>\
assert it to have been heard and transmitted, and<br>\
to be required by rule, but he adds that he had<br>\
searched for examples of it in the language of<br>\
the Arabs, and investigated their prose and their<br>\
poetry, without finding this word; (TA;) [He,<br>\
or it, annoyed him, molested him, harmed him,<br>\
or hurt him; or] he did what was disagreeable,<br>\
or hateful, or evil, to him. (Bd in xxxiii. 53,<br>\
Msb.) It is said in the Kur [xxxiii. 47],<br>\
وَدَعْ أَذَاهُمْ, meaning And leave thou the requiting<br>\
of them until thou receive a command respecting<br>\
them; (M, Bd, Jel;) namely, the hypocrites:<br>\
(M:) or leave thou unregarded their doing to<br>\
thee what is [annoying, molesting, harmful, hurtful, or] disagreeable, &amp;c., to thee. (Bd.)<br>\

harmed, or hurt]; (T;) or مَا يُؤْذِيكَ [a thing<br>\
that annoys, molests, harms, or hurts thee]:<br>\
