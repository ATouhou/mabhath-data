[these it is unnecessary to mention, for] the truth<br>\
is that it is a foreign word, [i. e. Hebrew,]<br>\

not much so; only found in plains, and producing<br>\
vegetation, which, however, is disapproved, because its situation is rugged, and little water<br>\
remains in it: (ISh:) pl. أَيَادِيمُ, (As, Esh-Sheybánee, IB, K,) which J erroneously says has no<br>\
sing.: (K:) for he says, [in the S,] أَيَادِيمُ signifies<br>\

has no sing. (TA.)<br>\
