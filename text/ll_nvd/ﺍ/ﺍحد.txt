أحّدهُ, [inf. n. تَأْحِيدٌ,] He made it one; or<br>\
called it one: as also وحّدهُ. (TA in art. وحد.)<br>\
You say, أَحِّدِ الِاثْنَيْنِ Make thou the two to become one. (K.) It is related in a trad., that<br>\
Mohammad said to a man who was making a<br>\
sign with his two fore fingers in repeating the<br>\
testimony of the faith, [There is no deity but God,<br>\
&amp;c.,] أَحِّدْأَحِّدْ [meaning that he should make the<br>\
sign with one finger only]. (S.) And أَحَدَّ اللّٰهَ<br>\
means He declared God to be one; he declared,<br>\
or professed, the unity of God; as also وحّدهُ.<br>\
(T and L in art. وحد.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَحِّدِ العَشَرَةَ, (S, K,)<br>\
inf. n. تَأْحِيدٌ, (K,) Make thou the ten to become<br>\
eleven, (S, K,) is a phrase mentioned by Fr on<br>\
the authority of an Arab of the desert. (S.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِتَّحَدَ: see art. وحد: and see what here<br>\
next follows.<br>\
10<br>\
استأحد He (a man, S) was, or became,<br>\
alone, by himself, apart from others, or solitary;<br>\
syn. اِنْفَرَدَ; (S, K;) as also ↓ اتَّحَدَ [written with<br>\
the disjunctive alif اِتَّحَدَ, originally اِئْتَحَدَ or<br>\
اِوتَحَدَ], (K, TA,) or تَوَحَّدَ. (CK.)<br>\
-A2-  مَا اسْتَأْحَدَ بِهِ<br>\
He did not know it; did not know, or had not<br>\
knowledge, of it; did not understand it; did not<br>\
know the minute circumstances of it; or did not<br>\
perceive it by any of the senses; syn. لَمْ يَشْعُرْ بِهِ;<br>\
(L, K;) i. e., a thing, or an affair: of the dial. of<br>\
El-Yemen. (L.)<br>\
أَحَدٌ, originally وَحَدٌ, the و being changed into أ,<br>\
(Msb,) One; the first of the numbers; (S;) syn.<br>\
[in many cases] with وَاحِدٌ; (S, Msb, K;) with<br>\
which it is interchangeable in two cases, to be<br>\
explained below: (Msb:) pl. آحَادٌ and أٌحْدَانٌ<br>\
(K) and أَحَدُونَ, which last occurs in a phrase<br>\
hereafter to be mentioned; (TA;) or it has no<br>\
pl. in this sense; (Msb, K, * TA;) and as to<br>\
آحَادٌ, it may be pl. of وَاحِدٌ, [and originally أَوْحَادٌ,]<br>\
like أَشْهَادٌ as pl. of شَاهِدٌ, (Th, Msb,) a pl. of<br>\
pauc. (Msb.) The fem. is ↓ إِحْدَى only; and<br>\
this is only used in particular cases, to be shown<br>\
below: (Msb:) most agree that the ى in this<br>\
word is the characteristic of the fem. gender: but<br>\
some say that it is to render it quasi-coordinate to<br>\
the quadriliteral-radical class: [this, however, is<br>\
inconsistent with its pronunciation, which is invariably إِحْدَى, not إِحْدَّى:] (TA:) its pl. is<br>\
إِحَدٌ, as though the sing. were إِحْدَةٌ, like as is<br>\
said of ذِكَرٌ as pl. of ذِكْرَى: one of the expositors<br>\
of the Tes-heel writes it أُحَدٌ, with damm and then<br>\
fet-h; but a pl. of this measure is not applicable<br>\
to a sing. of the measure فِعْلَى, with kesr. (MF.)<br>\
The dim. of أَحَدٌ is ↓ أُحَيْدٌ; and that of إِحْدَى is<br>\
↓ أُحَيْدَى. (L in art. وحد.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is interchangeable with وَاحِدٌ in two cases: first, when it is<br>\
used as an epithet applied to God: (Msb:) for<br>\
الأَحَدُ, as an epithet, is applied to God alone,<br>\
(Msb, K,) and signifies The One; the Sole; He<br>\
who has ever been one and alone: or the Indivisible: or He who has no second [to share] in his<br>\
lordship, nor in his essence, nor in his attributes:<br>\
(TA:) you say, هُوَ الوَاحِدُ and هُوَ الأَحَدُ: and in<br>\
like manner, أَحَدٌ, without the article, is used as<br>\
an epithet specially in relation to God, and is<br>\
interchangeable in this case [but not in other<br>\
cases] with وَاحِدٌ: therefore you do not say<br>\
رَجُلٌ أَحَدٌ nor دِرْهَمٌ أَحَدٌ and the like [but رَجُلٌ<br>\
وَاحدٌ and دِرهَمٌ وَاحِدٌ &amp;c.] (Msb.) [See also<br>\
وَاحِدٌ, in art. وحد.] In the phrase in the Kur<br>\
[cxii. 1], قُلْ هُوَ اللّٰهُ أَحَدٌ [Say, He is God, One<br>\
God], أَحَدٌ is a substitute for اللّٰهُ; for an indeterminate noun is sometimes a substitute for a<br>\
determinate noun, as in another passage in the<br>\
Kur, xcvi. 15 and 16. (S.) Secondly, it is interchangeable with وَاحِدٌ in certain nouns of number:<br>\
(Msb:) you say أَحَدَ عَشَرَ [masc.] and إِحْدَى عَشْرَةَ<br>\
[fem.] (S) [meaning Eleven: and in these two<br>\
cases you may not substitute وَاحِدٌ and وَاحِدَةٌ for<br>\
أَحَدٌ and إِحْدَى: but] in أَحَدٌوعَشْرُونَ [One and<br>\
twenty, and the like,] أَحَدٌ is interchangeable with<br>\
وَاحِدٌ. (Msb.) Ks says, When you prefix the<br>\
article ال to a number, prefix it to every number;<br>\
therefore you should say, مَا فَعَلَتِ الأَحَدَ العَشَرَ<br>\
الأَلْفَ الدِّرْهَمَ [What did the eleven thousand<br>\
dirhems?]: but the Basrees prefix it to the first<br>\
only, and say, ما فعلت الأَحَدَ عَشَرَ أَلْفَ دِرْهَمٍ. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  In [most] cases differing from these two, there<br>\
is a difference in usage between أَحَدٌ and وَاحِدٌ:<br>\
the former is used in affirmative phrases as a prefixed noun only, governing the noun which follows it in the gen. case; [as in exs. which will be<br>\
found below;] and is used absolutely in negative<br>\
phrases; [as will also be seen in exs. below;]<br>\
whereas وَاحِدٌ is used in affirmative phrases as a<br>\
prefixed noun and otherwise: the fem. إِحْدَى,<br>\
also, is only used as a prefixed noun, except in<br>\
numbers (Msb) [and in one other instance, which<br>\
see below]. Using أَحَدٌ and its fem. in affirmative<br>\
phrases as prefixed nouns, you say, قَامَ أَحَدُ الثَّلَاثَةِ<br>\
[One of the three stood]; and قَالَتْ إِحْدَا هُمَا [One<br>\
of them two (females) said]; and خُذْ إِحْدَى<br>\
الثَّلَاثَةِ [Take thou one of the three]. (TA.) The<br>\
phrase إِحْدَى بَنَاتِ طَبَقٍ means A calamity:<br>\
(K:) or, as some say, (TA, but in the K “ and,”)<br>\
a serpent; (K, TA;) so called because it twists<br>\
itself round so as to become like a طَبَق. (TA.)<br>\
And the phrase إِحْدَى الإِحَدِ, (L, K, TA,) in<br>\
which the latter word has kesr to the إ and fet-h<br>\
to the ح, and is pl. of the former, also written<br>\
الأُحَدِ, but this form is disapproved by MF, as<br>\
has been shown above, (TA, [in several copies<br>\
of the K incorrectly written الأَحَدِ,]) [lit. means<br>\
One of the ones; and] is applied to a great, or<br>\
mighty, event; (L, K, TA;) one that is difficult,<br>\
distressing, grievous, or terrible. (L, TA.) You<br>\
say, أَتَى بِإِحْدَى الإِحَدِ [the last of which words<br>\
is here again written in several copies of the K<br>\
الأَحَدِ] He brought to pass a grievous, and great,<br>\
or mighty, event, (K, TA,) when you desire to<br>\
express the greatness and terribleness of an event.<br>\
(TA.) You also say, فُلَانُ أَحَدُ الأَحَدِينَ, and<br>\
وَاحِدُ الأَحَدِينَ, (K, TA,) the latter in one copy<br>\
of the K written وَاحِدُ الوَاحِدِينَ, in which the<br>\
latter word is pl. of the former, (TA,) and وَاحِدُ<br>\
الآحَادِ, and إِحْدَى الإِحَدِ, (K, TA,) like a phrase<br>\
before mentioned, only the former is applied to a<br>\
calamity, and this to an intelligent being, and<br>\
written in the two manners before mentioned, the<br>\
difference being only in application, (TA, [in<br>\
several copies of the K here again written إِحْدَى<br>\
الأَحَدِ, and in the CK اَحَدِىُّ الاَحَدِ,]) and إِحْدَى<br>\
الأَحَدِينَ, (Et-Tes-heel,) and إِحْدَى الآحَادِ, (TA,)<br>\
which are expressions of the utmost praise, (IAar,<br>\
A Heyth, K,) [lit. Such a man is one of the ones;<br>\
meaning] such a one is unique among the uniques;<br>\
(TA;) one who has no equal; unequalled; incomparable. (IAar, Tes-heel.) It seems that the<br>\
form of pl. used in the phrase أَحَدُ الأَحَدِينَ is<br>\
used only as applied to rational beings; but it is<br>\
said in the Expositions of the Tes-heel that this<br>\
phrase signifies One of the calamities; the form<br>\
of the rational pl. being given to nouns significant<br>\
of things deemed great, mighty, or grievous.<br>\
(AHeyth.) In the phrase إِحْدَى الإِحَدِ, the fem.<br>\
forms are said to be used for the purpose of giving<br>\
intensiveness to the signification, as though the<br>\
meaning were دَاهِيَةُ الدَّوَاهِى, the word داهية being<br>\
[an intensive epithet] from دَهَآءٌ as signifying<br>\
intelligence, or intelligence mixed with craft or<br>\
cunning and forecast; or by داهية being meant a<br>\
calamity. (Expositions of the Fs, TA.) AHei<br>\
thought أَحَدُ الأَحَدِينَ to be an epithet applied to<br>\
a male, and إِحْدَى الإِحَدِ to be applied to a<br>\
female: but his opinion has been refuted by EdDemámeenee in the Expos. of the Tes-heel: and<br>\
this latter author there remarks, that in expressions<br>\
meant to denote praise [of a man], أَحَدٌ and<br>\
إِحْدَى are prefixed to their own proper pls., as<br>\
أَحَدُونَ and إِحَدٌ; or to an epithet, as in the case<br>\
of أَحَدُ العُلَمَآءِ [One of the learned]; but that they<br>\
have not been heard prefixed to generic nouns.<br>\
(TA.) You say likewise, هُوَ ابْنُ إِحْدَاهَا He is<br>\
born of noble, or generous, ancestors, both on the<br>\
father&#39;s and the mother&#39;s side; speaking of a<br>\
man and of a camel. (L and K in art. وحد.) And<br>\
لَا يَقُومُ بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ إِلَّا ابْنُ إِحْدَاهَا None will manage<br>\
this thing, or affair, but a noble, or generous,<br>\
man. (AZ, L in art. وحد.) And ↓ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُهَا<br>\
ابْنُ إِحْداتِهَا [None will be able to perform it but<br>\
a noble, or generous, man]. (L in art. وحد.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
One instance is mentioned, of the occurrence, in<br>\
a trad., of إِحْدَى not used as a part of a number<br>\
[i. e. not as a part of the compound إِحْدَى عَشْرَةَ]<br>\
nor as a prefixed noun; viz., إِحْدَى مِنْ سَبْعٍ<br>\
[One of seven]; in which سبع is said to mean the<br>\
nights of &#39;Ád [during which that tribe was destroyed], or the years of Joseph [during which<br>\
Egypt was afflicted with dearth]. (MF, from the<br>\
Fáïk &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Used in a negative phrase, أَحَدٌ<br>\
signifies Any one with whom one may talk or<br>\
speak: and in this manner it is used without<br>\
variation as sing. and pl. and fem. (S) as well as<br>\
masc. (Msb.) You say, لَا أَحَدَ فِي الدَّارِ [There<br>\
is not any one in the house]: but you do not say,<br>\
فِيهَا أَحَدٌ [as meaning the contrary]. (S.) We<br>\
read in the Kur [lxix. 47, this ex. of its use as a<br>\
masc. pl.], فَمَا مِنْكُمْ مِنْ أَحَدٍ عَنْهُ حَاجِزِينَ [And<br>\
not any persons of you should have withheld me<br>\
from punishing him]. (S.) And in the same<br>\
[xxxiii. 32, we find this ex. of its use as a fem.<br>\
pl.], لَسْتُنَّ كَأَحَدٍ مِنَ النِّسَآءِ [Ye are not like any<br>\
others of women]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b6-  It is also used in<br>\
interrogative phrases; as in the saying, هَلْ أَحَدٌ<br>\
رَأَي مِثْلَ هٰذَا [Has any one seen the like of this?];<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, L;) and in the saying, يَا حَدْ رَآهَا [for<br>\
يَا أَحَدٌ, O, has any one seen her, or it?]. (L,<br>\
from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b7-  It is [said to be] also used in the<br>\
sense of شَىءٌ [meaning Anything], applied to an<br>\
irrational being; as in the saying, مَا بِا لدَّارِ مِنْ أَحَدٍ<br>\
إِلَّا حِمَارًا There is not in the house anything,<br>\
rational or irrational, except an ass: so that the<br>\
thing excepted is united in kind to that from<br>\
which the exception is made [accord. to this rendering; but this instance is generally regarded as<br>\
one in which the thing excepted is disunited in<br>\
kind from that from which the exception is made].<br>\
(Msb.) So too in the Kur lx. 11, accord. to the<br>\
reading of Ibn-Mes&#39;ood: (Msb:) but others there<br>\
read شَىْءٌ, which may mean any one or any thing.<br>\
(Bd, Jel.) ―<br>\
-b8-  الأَحَدٌ, (K,) as also يَوْمَ الأَحَدِ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) as a proper name, (Msb,) is applied to<br>\
A certain day; (K;) [Sunday;] the first day of<br>\
the week; or, as some say, [i. e. as some term it,]<br>\
the second of the week; (TA;) for the Arabs are<br>\
said, by IAar, to have reckoned the Sabbath, or<br>\
Saturday, as the first, though they called Sunday<br>\
the first of the days: (Msb in art. جمع:) it is<br>\
sing., and masc.: (Lh:) pl. [as above, i. e.]<br>\
آحَادٌ (S, Msb, K) and أُحْدَانٌ: (K:) or it has no<br>\
pl. (K: [but in the TA this last observation is<br>\
very properly restricted, as relating only to أَحَدٌ<br>\
as syn. with وَاحِدٌ, and as applied to any unknown<br>\
person.]) In this sense, it has no dim. (Sb, in S,<br>\
art. امس.) ―<br>\
-b9-  الآحَادُ in lexicology signifies What<br>\
have been transmitted by some of the lexicologists,<br>\
but not by such a number of them as cannot be<br>\
supposed to have agreed to a falsehood: what has<br>\
been transmitted by this larger number is termed<br>\
مُتَوَاتِرُ. (Mz 3rd نوع.)<br>\
إِحْدَي: fems. of أَحَدٌ, q. v.<br>\
إِحْدَاةٌ: fems. of أَحَدٌ, q. v.<br>\
أَحَدِيَّةٌ The unity of God; (Msb;) as also<br>\
وَحْدَانِيَّةٌ. (L and K in art. وحد.)<br>\
أُحَادَ [accus. of أُحَادُ] is imperfectly decl., because of its deviation from its original, (S, K,)<br>\
both in form and in meaning; (S;) [being<br>\
changed in form from وَاحِدًا, and in meaning<br>\
from اوَاحِدًا: (see ثُلَاثَ:)] you<br>\
say, جَاؤُوا أُحَادَ أُحَادَ, [احاد being repeated for<br>\
the purpose of corroboration,] meaning, They<br>\
came one [and] one, one [and] one; or one [by] one,<br>\
one [by] one. (S, K.) The dim. of أُحَادُ is ↓ أُحَيِّدٌ,<br>\
perfectly decl., like ثُلَيِّثٌ [q. v.] &amp;c. (S, in art.<br>\
ثلث.)<br>\
أُحَيْدٌ dim. of أَحَدٌ, q. v.<br>\
