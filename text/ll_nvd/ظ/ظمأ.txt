ظِمْءٌ a subst. from ظَمِئَ (S, M, K) in both of<br>\

keeping of camels from the water [during that<br>\
interval, i. e.] until the extreme limit of the<br>\
coming thereto: (S:) pl. أَظْمَآءٌ. (T, S, M.) The<br>\
shortest ظِمْءٌ of camels is that termed غِبٌّ, i. e.,<br>\
when they come to the water one day and return,<br>\
and are in the place of pasture a day, and come<br>\
to the water [again] on the third day; the interval between their two drinkings being termed a<br>\
ظِمْء: this is during the greatest heat: but when<br>\
Suheyl [i. e. Canopus] rises [aurorally, which it<br>\
did in Central Arabia, about the commencement<br>\
of the era of the Flight, on the 4th of August,<br>\
O. S.], they increase the ظِمْء, so that the camels<br>\
remain in the place of pasture two days, and<br>\
come to the water on the fourth; and one says,<br>\
وَرَدَتْ رِبْعًا: then follow the خِمْس and the سِدْس<br>\
to the عِشْر: and the interval between their two<br>\
drinkings is termed ظِمْءٌ, whether long or short.<br>\
(T.) One says, مَا بَقِىَ مِنْ عُمُرِهِ إِلَّا ظِمْءُ الحِمَارِ,<br>\
(T, S, * K, * TA,) meaning There remained not of<br>\
his life save a little; [lit., save the period between<br>\
the two drinkings of the ass;] (S, K, * TA;) because there is no beast that bears thirst for a<br>\
shorter time than the ass; (T, S, * K, * TA;)<br>\
for he comes to the water in summer every day<br>\
twice. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
