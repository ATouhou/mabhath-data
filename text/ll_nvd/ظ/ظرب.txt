ظَرِبَ بِهِ, aor.<br>\
ظَرَبَ, He, or it, stuck, adhered,<br>\
or clave, to him, or it. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
ظُرِّبَتِ الحَوَافِرُ, inf. n. تَظْرِيبٌ, The solid hoofs<br>\
became hard and strong. (T, K.)<br>\
ظَرِبٌ A stone projecting (Lth, T, M, Msb, K)<br>\
from a mountain or from rugged ground (Lth,<br>\
T) and having a sharp point: (Lth, T, M, K:) or<br>\
an expanded mountain, (M, K, TA,) accord. to<br>\
some, that is not high: (TA:) or a small mountain: (M, K:) or a small hill: (T, S, Msb:)<br>\
pl. ظِرَابٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and أَظْرُبٌ, (Nh,<br>\
TA,) [the latter a pl. of pauc.,] the former pl. of<br>\
a rare kind, for by rule it should be أَظْرَابٌ, and<br>\
it seems as though they had imagined the sing. to<br>\
be ظَرْبٌ, and so made the pl. like سِهَامٌ, pl. of<br>\
سَهْمٌ: (Msb, TA:) or, accord. to En-Nadr, ظَرِبٌ<br>\
signifies the smallest of [hills such as are termed]<br>\
آكَام, and the sharpest in stones, all its stones<br>\
being sharp like knives, the white thereof and the<br>\
black and of every colour: and the pl. is أَظْرَابٌ.<br>\
(T.) [See also this pl. below.]<br>\
ظُرُبٌّ Short, and thick, (M, K, TA,) and fleshy:<br>\
(Lh, TA:) or a short and fleshy man. (S.)<br>\
ظَرْبَى and ظِرْبَى: see ظَرِبَانٌ, in three places.<br>\
ظِرْبَآء and ظَِرِبَآء: see the next paragraph, in four<br>\
places.<br>\
ظَرِبَانٌ (S, M, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ظِرْبَانٌ (AA,<br>\
AZ, Msb, TA) and ظَرْبَانٌ (IJ, TA) and ↓ ظِرَبَآءُ<br>\
(M, CK, TA, or ↓ ظِرْبَآء or ↓ ظِرِبَآء accord. to two<br>\
different copies of the K) A small, stinking beast,<br>\
(AZ, S, M, Msb, K,) resembling a cat, (AZ, S,<br>\
M, K,) or resembling a short Chinese dog, (Msb,)<br>\
or resembling an ape or a monkey, (AA, T, M,<br>\
TA,) or above the whelp of a dog, (El-Mustaksee,<br>\
TA,) that often emits a noiseless wind from the<br>\
anus; (M, Msb, * TA;) said by Az, on the<br>\
authority of the handwriting of AHeyth, to be<br>\
a beast that has small legs, their length being that<br>\
of half a finger, but which is broad, its breadth<br>\
being equal to the space measured by the extension<br>\
of the thumb and the little finger, or of the thumb<br>\
and the fore finger, and its length being a cubit,<br>\
having a compact head, and its ears [for ادناه, in<br>\
my original, I read أُذُنَاهُ] being like the cat&#39;s;<br>\
(TA;) it is small and short in the ears, (أَصْلَمُ<br>\
الأُذُنَيْنِ, M, Msb,) or having a stoppage of the<br>\
ears, (أَصَمُّ الاذنين, TA,) its earholes [only] hearing a confused, or humming, or ringing, sound;<br>\
(M, TA;) long in the snout, [but El-Farezdak<br>\
speaks of it as having a short nose, as is shown<br>\
in the S,] black in the back, white in the belly;<br>\
(M, Msb, TA;) it is said that its back is [or<br>\
rather contains] one single bone, without any قَفَص<br>\
[or cage-formed structure of ribs, &amp;c.], and that<br>\
the sword has no effect upon it by reason of the<br>\
hardness of its skin, unless striking its nose: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. is ظَرَابِينُ, (M, K,) or ظَرَابِىُّ, (AZ, T, S,<br>\
Msb,) sometimes, (S,) or this latter also, (M, K,)<br>\
as though it were pl. of ظِرْبَآء, (S,) or the first ى<br>\
is a substitute for the ا [of the sing. ظَرِبَانٌ] and<br>\
the second for the ن, (M,) and (quasi-pl. ns.,<br>\
M, K) ↓ ظِرْبَى (AZ, T, M, Msb, K) and ↓ ظِرْبَآءُ,<br>\
(M, K,) or ↓ ظِرْبَى, is a pl. like حِجْلَى pl. of<br>\
حَجَلٌ, (S, TA,) and these two are [said to be]<br>\
the only pls. of this measure, (AHei, TA,) and<br>\
Lth and AHeyth say that ظِرْبَآءُ is incorrect, and<br>\
is rightly ↓ ظِرْبَى. (T, TA.) A poet says, (namely,<br>\
&#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Hajjáj Ez-Zebeedee, M, TA,)<br>\
أَلَا أَبْلِغَا قَيْسًا وَخِنْدِفَ أَنَّنِى<br>\
ضَرَبْتُ كَثِيرًا مَضْرِبَ الظَّرِبَانِ<br>\
[Now tell ye Keys and Khindif that I have struck<br>\
Ketheer in the place of striking of the ظربان],<br>\
meaning that he had struck Ketheer Ibn-Shiháb<br>\
(S, M, TA) El-Medh-hijee upon his face; for<br>\
the ظربان has a line, or long mark, upon his<br>\
face; and he likens the blow that he inflicted<br>\
upon his face to that mark: [see مَضْرِبٌ:] and<br>\
the same words of the latter hemistich, except<br>\
that عُبَيْدًا is substituted in them for كَثِيرًا, occur<br>\
in a verse of Asad Ibn-Nághisah, who slew<br>\
&#39;Obeyd by order of En-Noamán. (TA.) One<br>\
says, فَسَا بَيْنَنَا الظَّرِبَانُ, (S,) or بَيْنَهُم, (Msb, K,) [lit.<br>\
The ظربان emitted a noiseless wind from its anus<br>\
among us, or among them,] a prov., (S,) meaning<br>\
that we, or they, became disunited, and alienated,<br>\
one from another: [for] when this animal emits<br>\
a noiseless wind from its anus in the garment of<br>\
a man, the stink does not go away until the garment wears out: (S, Msb, K:) the Arabs of the<br>\
desert assert that it does so in the garment of him<br>\
who hunts it: (S:) and it is said to do so in the<br>\
hole of the [lizard called] ضَبّ, which, being<br>\
stupified by the foulness of the stink, is taken<br>\
and eaten by it. (M, K, TA.) One says also,<br>\
تَشَاتَمَا فَكَأَنَّمَا جَزَرَا بَيْنَهُمَا ظَرِبَانًا [They reviled each<br>\
other, and it was as though they slaughtered<br>\
between them a ظربان]: the foulness of their<br>\
reviling being likened to the stink of that animal.<br>\
(M, TA.) And يَتَنَازَعَانِ جِلْدَ الظَّرِبَانِ They two<br>\
contend in pulling at the skin of the ظربان,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  they revile each other: (M, TA:) and<br>\
يَتَمَاشَنَانِ جِلْدَ الظَّرِبَانِ They wipe their hands together upon the skin of the ظربان, [likewise]<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  they revile each other. (IAar, T, TA.)<br>\
الأَظْرَابُ [accord. to some] signifies Four teeth<br>\
behind the نَوَاجِذ [or other grinders; app.<br>\
meaning, of a horse]: (K:) or the sockets (أَسْنَاخ)<br>\
of the teeth: (S, K:) [and it is said that] أَظْرَابُ<br>\
اللِّجَامِ signifies the knots that are at the extremities of the bit. (M, TA.) J cites the following<br>\
verse, ascribing it to &#39;Ámir Ibn-Et-Tufeyl,<br>\
وَمُقَطِّعٍ حَلَقَ الرِّحَالَةِ سَابِحٍ<br>\
بَادٍ نَوَاجِذُهُ عَنِ الأَظْرَابِ<br>\
[thus in the S, (but in the M and TA عَلَى<br>\
الأَظْرَابِ,) as though meaning And breaking in<br>\
pieces the rings of the girth of the saddle, running<br>\
with the fore legs well stretched forth, his grinders<br>\
appearing from the sockets]: but IB says, [following the reading in the M and TA,] the verse is<br>\
by Lebeed; and the poet is describing a horse<br>\
that breaks in pieces the rings of the saddle<br>\
by his springing forward, and whose grinders<br>\
(نَوَاجِذُهُ) appear when he treads upon the [stones,<br>\
or hills, called] ظِرَاب: [see ظَرِبٌ, of which both<br>\
ظِرَابٌ and أَظْرَابٌ are said to be pls.:] also that<br>\
the right reading is وَمُقَطِّعٌ [and سَابِحٌ]: and by<br>\
the نواجذ are meant the ضَوَاحِك [or teeth next<br>\
behind the canine teeth], accord. to Hr. (TA.)<br>\
حَوَافِرُ مُظَرَّبَةٌ [accord. to the TA مُظَرِّبَةٌ, but this<br>\
is evidently a mistake (see 2),] means [Solid<br>\
hoofs] that have become hard and strong: (K,<br>\
TA:) [but] accord. to El-Mufaddal, المُظَرَّبُ,<br>\
like مُعَظَّم [in measure], signifies الَّذِى قَدْ لَوَّحَتْهُ<br>\
الظِّرَابُ [app. meaning that which the stones, or<br>\
hills, called ظِرَاب have altered, or, perhaps,<br>\
heated, in its treading upon them]. (TA.)<br>\
