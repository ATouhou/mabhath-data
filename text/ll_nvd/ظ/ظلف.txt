and so طَلَّفَ and طَلَّثَ and ذَرَّفَ &amp;c. (T, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
ظالفهُ: see 1, former half: it is a mistake,<br>\
in the K, for اظلفهُ. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اظلف, said of a man, (IAar, T, O,) or of a<br>\

ground such as horses like to run upon: (T:) or<br>\
(i. e. the last) a place elevated above the water<br>\
and the mud; and so ↓ ظَلِفٌ; (K;) this last<br>\
thus expl. by Ibn-&#39;Abbád: (O:) or this last and<br>\
↓ ظَلِفَةٌ, accord. to ISh, (TA,) or ↓ ظَلَفٌ and<br>\
↓ ظَلَفَةٌ, (so accord. to a copy of the T, in which<br>\
the authority is not mentioned,) signify ground,<br>\
or land, in which the foot-mark will not appear,<br>\
and which is high and rugged: and accord. to<br>\
Fr, ↓ ظَلِفٌ and ↓ ظَلِفَةٌ signify ground, or land,<br>\
that will not show a foot-mark; as though it<br>\
were prevented from doing so: (T, TA:) and<br>\
↓ ظِلْفٌ, (so in a copy of the T,) or ↓ ظَلِفٌ, (so in<br>\
the TA,) accord. to Fr, signifies such as is soft,<br>\
of ground, or land: but accord. to IAar, such as<br>\
is hard, and does not show a foot-mark; in which<br>\
is no softness, so as to be difficult to him who walks<br>\
upon it; nor sand, so that the camels would have<br>\
their feet burnt upon it; nor stones, so that they<br>\
would be chafed, or abraded, in the soles of their<br>\
feet, upon it: and it is also expl. (by IAar, TA)<br>\
as meaning such as is rugged and hard, of ground,<br>\

means of subsistence.]<br>\
-A2-  ظَلْفٌ also signifies Ineffectual, null, or void: and allowable. (TK.)<br>\
One says, ذَهَبَ دَمُهُ ظَلْفًا, (AA, S, M, O, K,)<br>\
and ↓ طَلَفًا, (AA, T, S, M, O, K,) and ↓ ظَلِيفًا,<br>\
(M,) as also طَلْفًا and طَلَفًا (AA, O) [and طَلِيفًا],<br>\
His blood went for nothing; as a thing of no<br>\
account; ineffectually; or in vain; unretaliated,<br>\
or uncompensated by a mulct. (AA, T, S, M,<br>\
O, K.)<br>\
[<br>\
الظُّلْفُ in Har p. 312, there said to be used<br>\
as meaning Continence, and disdain of base<br>\
actions, is app. a mistake for الظَّلْفُ, inf. n. of 1<br>\
in the phrase ظَلَفَ نَفْسَهُ.]<br>\
ظِلْفٌ The ظُفْر [meaning cloven hoof] of any<br>\
ruminant (T, M) of the bovine kind and the like;<br>\
(T;) [i. e.] it is an appertenance of the bovine<br>\
kind and of the sheep and goat (S, O, Msb, K)<br>\
and of the gazelle or antelope (S, O, K) and the<br>\
like, (O, Msb, K,) which is to them like the ظُفْر<br>\
to man, (Msb,) or like the قَدَم to us: (K:) one<br>\
says the رِجْل and قَدَم of a man, and the حَافِر of a<br>\
horse, and the خُفّ of a camel and of an ostrich,<br>\
and the ظِلْف of a bovine animal and of a sheep<br>\
or goat [and the like]: (ISk, T, TA:) pl. أَظْلَافٌ<br>\
(S, M, O, Msb, K) and ظُلُوفٌ: (S, O, K:) and<br>\
أَظْلَاف is applied, by &#39;Amr Ibn-Maadee-kerib, to<br>\
the hoofs of horses, (S, M, O,) as is said by Lth<br>\
and Az and IF, by poetic license, (O,) metaphorically: (S, O:) and by El-Akhtal, metaphorically, to the feet of men. (M, IB, TA.)<br>\
[Its dual is used in the K, in explanations of the<br>\
words شَعِرَةٌ and أَشْعَرُ, in the latter instance on<br>\
the authority of Lh, as meaning The two<br>\
halves of a cloven hoof.] And one says, مَا<br>\
جَشِمْتُ إِلَيْكَ ظِلْفًا [app. meaning I have not had<br>\
the trouble of bringing to thee so much as the<br>\
hoof of a gazelle or the like]. (AZ, TA in art.<br>\
جشم, q. v.) And هُوَ يَأْكُلُهُ بِضِرْسٍ وَيَطَؤُهُ بِظِلْفٍ<br>\
[He eats it with a lateral tooth, and treads it<br>\
with a cloven hoof; app. meaning, vehemently].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is sometimes used as meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  Cloven-hoofed animals. (TA.) One says, مَا<br>\
لَهُ خُفٌّ وَلَا حَافِرٌ وَلَا ظِلْفٌ (tropical:)  [He possesses not<br>\
camels, nor horses or asses or mules, nor sheep or<br>\
goats or other cloven-hoofed beasts]. (TA in art.<br>\
خف.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It also signifies [or implies] The making<br>\
consecutive progressions in walking and in other<br>\
actions, (T, K,) or, accord. to the L, in a thing.<br>\
(TA.) One says, جَآءَتِ الإِبِلُ عَلَى ظِلْفٍ وَاحِدٍ<br>\
(T, A, O, TA) i. e. The camels came following<br>\
one another. (A, TA. [See also a similar phrase<br>\
voce خُفٌّ.]) And غَنَمُ فُلَانٍ ظِلْفٍ وَاحِدٍ<br>\
and وَاحِدٍ ↓ ظَلَفٍ The sheep, or goats, of such a<br>\
one, have all of them brought forth [app. one after<br>\
another]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A thing that is suitable<br>\
to the requirements of a man, and of a beast:<br>\
(M:) and an object of desire: (M, O, K:) and<br>\
an object of want. (T, K.) One says, أَصَابَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ ظِلْفَهُ Such a one attained what was suitable<br>\
to his requirements, and what he desired: and<br>\
sometimes one says the like of any beast that<br>\
finds, or lights on, or meets with, that which he<br>\
likes. (M.) وَجَدَتِ الدَّابَّةُ ظِلْفَهَا is a prov., (M,<br>\
O,) applied to him who finds the means of attaining that which he seeks; (Meyd;) meaning [The<br>\
beast found what was suitable to its requirements;<br>\
or,] what withheld it [from other things] and<br>\
prevented its desire [thereof]. (A, TA. [See<br>\
also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov., ii. 807.]) And one<br>\
says, وَجَدَتِ الشَّاةُ ظِلْفَهَا The sheep, or goat, found<br>\
suitable pasturage, and therefore did not quit it:<br>\
(K, TA:) a prov. mentioned by Fr; applied to<br>\
him, of men and of beasts, that finds what is<br>\
suitable to him. (TA.) And بَلَدٌ مِنْ ظِلْفِ الغَنَمِ<br>\
A country of such as are suitable to sheep or goats.<br>\
(M.) And وَجَدَ ظِلْفَهُ He found what he loved,<br>\
(O,) or what he desired, (K,) and what was<br>\
suitable to him; (TA;) said of a man. (O.)<br>\
And مَا وَجَدْتُ عِنْدَهُ ظِلْفِى I did not find with<br>\
him the object of my want. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
ظَلْفٌ, near the middle of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  [In<br>\
some copies of the K, الظِّلْفُ is erroneously put<br>\
for الظَّلَفُ as relating to the means of subsistence.<br>\
And in the CK ظِلْفُهَا is erroneously put for ظَلِفُهَا<br>\
as meaning ظَلِفُ النَّفْسِ.]<br>\
ظَلَفٌ [as an inf. n.: see 1, last quarter. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also] Hardness, or difficulty, (S, O, K,) or<br>\
coarseness, (M,) in the means of subsistence: (S,<br>\
M, O, K:) thus the word is correctly written:<br>\
not ظِلْف, as we find it written in [copies of] the<br>\
K: [nor ظَلْف, as in the CK:] and ظَلَفُ العَيْشِ<br>\
occurs in a trad., (O, TA,) meaning straitness,<br>\
and hardness or difficulty, and coarseness, of the<br>\
means of subsistence. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also ظَلْفٌ,<br>\
in three places, near the beginning of the paragraph.<br>\

estimation, paltry, or despicable; [as also طَلَفٌ;]<br>\
syn. كُلُّ هَيْنٍ, (M,) or كُلُّ هَيِّنٍ. (TA.)<br>\

See also ظِلْفٌ, latter half. ―<br>\
-b2-  And see ظَلِيفَة.<br>\
ظَلِفٌ: see ظَلْفٌ, former half, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  ظَلِفُ النَّفْسِ, [accord. to the CK ظَلْفُ النَّفْسِ,<br>\
but this is a mistranscription,] and النَّفْسِ ↓ ظَلِيفُ,<br>\
(M, O, K,) A man who withholds himself from<br>\
the love, or blamable love, of a thing: (M:) or<br>\
one who abstains from that which is indecorous;<br>\
syn. نَزِهُ النَّفْسِ. (O, K.) And اِمْرَأَةٌ ظَلِفَةُ النَّفْسِ<br>\
i. q. عَزِيزَةٌ عِنْدَ نَفْسِهَا [app. A woman strong to<br>\
resist, in her own estimation; and therefore<br>\
meaning one who abstains from that which is<br>\
indecorous: Golius renders it mulier pudica, et<br>\
de honore suo sollicita]. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also<br>\
ظَلِفَةٌ.<br>\
[<br>\
الظُّلَفُ in Har p. 623, there said to mean The<br>\
restraining the soul from its desire, or blamable<br>\
inclination, is app. a mistranscription for الظَّلَفُ,<br>\
inf. n. of ظَلِفَتِ النَّفْسُ.]<br>\
ظَلْفَةٌ: see ظَلْفٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain brand, or<br>\
mark made with a hot iron, upon a camel; and<br>\
so ↓ ظَلِفَةٌ. (O, K.)<br>\
ظَلَفَةٌ: see ظَلْفٌ, in two places, near the beginning. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps,] one says, أَقَامَهُ اللّٰهُ,<br>\
عَلَى الظَّلَفَاتِ, (TA, [there said to be مُحَرَّكَة,])<br>\
or الظلِفات, (so in a copy of the T, [i. e.<br>\
↓ الظَّلِفَاتِ,]) meaning [God made him to keep to]<br>\
a state of hardship and straitness. (T, TA.)<br>\
ظَلِفَةٌ: see ظَلْفٌ, in four places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see<br>\
ظَلَفَةٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and ظَلْفَةٌ.<br>\
-A3-  Also The [lower] end of<br>\
the [curved piece of wood called the] حِنْو [that lies<br>\
against the side, at the fore part and at the hinder<br>\

the [kind called] إِكَاف, and the like; being in<br>\
what is next to the ground, of the sides thereof:<br>\
(Lth, T, TA:) or its pl., which is ظَلِفَاتٌ (S, M,<br>\
O, K) and ↓ ظَلِفٌ, (O, K, [or rather the latter is<br>\
a coll. gen. n.,]) signifies the four pieces of wood,<br>\
(S, M, O, K,) of the [saddle called the] رَحْل and<br>\
of the [saddle called the] قَتَب, (S, O,) that are<br>\
upon the two sides of the camel, (S, M, O, K,) the<br>\
lower ends of which touch the ground when they<br>\
are put down upon it; in the وَاسِط [or fore part<br>\
of the saddle] are two (i. e. ظَلِفَتَانِ), and so in<br>\
the مُؤَخَّرَة [or hinder part], and they are the<br>\
lower portions of the حِنْوَانِ; (S, O, K;) for the<br>\
parts above them, next to the [pieces of wood called<br>\
the] عَرَاقِى, are [called] the عَضُدَانِ, and the<br>\
elongated pieces of wood upon the sides of the<br>\
camel are the أَحْنَآء [pl. of حِنْوٌ]: (S, O:) AZ<br>\
says that the upper portions of the ظَلِفَتَانِ, [a<br>\
mistake for the حِنْوَانِ, as is shown by what<br>\
follows,] next to the عَرَاقِى, are [called] the<br>\

are the lower parts of the حِنْوَانِ of the وَاسِط and<br>\
