ظَلَّ, aor. يَظِلُّ, inf. n. ظِلَالَةٌ: see 4.<br>\
-A2-  ظَلَّ,<br>\
(T, M, Msb, K,) first pers. ظَلِلْتُ, (T, S, M, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) [and accord. to SM ظَلَلْتُ also, for<br>\
he says that] the verb is of the class of مَنَعَ as<br>\
well as of the class of تَعِبَ, (TA,) and ظَلْتُ,<br>\
(T, S, * M, O, K,) likened to لَسْتُ, (M, K, *)<br>\
formed by rejecting the former ل in ظَلِلْتُ,<br>\
(T, O,) and ظِلْتُ, which is [also] originally<br>\
ظَلِلْتُ, (Sb, T, M, O, K,) formed by transferring<br>\
to the ظ the vowel of the rejected ل, (Sb, T, M,<br>\
O,) anomalously, (Sb, M,) the latter of the dial.<br>\
of the people of El-Hijáz; (T;) aor. يَظَلُّ; (S, *<br>\
M, O, * Msb, K;) imperative اِظْلَلْ and ظَلْ (T)<br>\
[and it is implied in the M voce قَرَّ that one says<br>\
also اِظْلِلْ and ظِلْ, which indicates that the aor.<br>\
is also يَظِلُّ, but this requires confirmation, which<br>\
I have not anywhere found]; inf. n. ظُلُولٌ (T,<br>\
S, M, O, Msb, K) and ظَلٌّ (M, K) and ظِلٌّ;<br>\
(thus also in a copy of the M; [but this I think<br>\
doubtful;]) accord. to Lth, (T,) or Kh, (Msb,)<br>\
[i. e. accord. to the author of the &#39;Eyn,] is said<br>\
only of a thing that is done in the day, or daytimes; (T, S, M, O, Msb;) like as بَاتَ, aor. يَبِيتُ,<br>\
is said only of a thing that is done in the night:<br>\
(T:) it is an incomplete [i. e. a non-attributive]<br>\
verb, relating to a time in which is a shade from<br>\
the sun, from morning to evening, or from sunrise to sunset: (Esh-Shiháb, TA:) one says, ظَلَّ<br>\
فُلَانٌ نَهَارَهُ صَائِمًا [Such a one was during his day<br>\
fasting; or he passed his day fasting]: (Lth, T:)<br>\
and ظَلَّ نَهَارَهُ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا [He was in, or during,<br>\
his day doing such a thing; or he passed his day<br>\
doing such a thing]: (M, K:) and ظَلِلْتُ أَعْمَلُ<br>\
كَذَا [I was in the day or daytime, or I passed<br>\
the day, doing such a thing; or] I did such a<br>\
thing in the day or daytime. (S, O, Msb. *) In<br>\
the saying of &#39;Antarah,<br>\
وَلَقَدْ أَبِيتُ عَلَى الطَّوَى وَأَظَلُّهُ<br>\
حَتَّى أَنَالَ بِهِ كَرِيمَ المَأْكَلِ<br>\
[app. meaning And verily I pass the night in<br>\
hunger, and I pass the day in it, that I may<br>\
attain thereby plentiful eating], أَظَلُّهُ is for أَظَلُّ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ. (S, O.) And accord. to some, (TA,) ظَلَّ<br>\
لَيْلَهُ occurs in poetry; (M, K, TA;) so that one<br>\
says, ظَلَّ لَيْلَهُ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا [He was in, or during,<br>\
his night, or he passed his night, doing such a<br>\
thing]: but it is said that in this case the verb<br>\
has the meaning next following. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
it signifies also He, or it, became; syn. صَارَ:<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA:) being in this sense likewise<br>\
an incomplete [i. e. a non-attributive] verb,<br>\
divested of that meaning of time which it<br>\
radically denotes; as in the phrase in the Kur<br>\
[xvi. 60 and xliii. 16], ظَلَّ وَجْهُهُ مُسْوَدًّا [His<br>\
face becomes black]: so says Ibn-Málik: (TA:)<br>\
or this may mean his face continues all the day<br>\
black: (Bd in xvi. 60:) and one says also, ظَلَّ<br>\
يَفْعَلُ كَذَا meaning He continued doing such a<br>\
thing: this too is mentioned by Ibn-Málik, and<br>\
is of the dial. of the people of Syria. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
It is also a complete [i. e. an attributive] verb as<br>\
meaning He, or it, continued; as is said in the<br>\
Expos. of the “ Shifè,” and by Ibn-Málik; and,<br>\
as Ibn-Málik likewise says, it was, or became,<br>\
long. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
ظللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ [He made it to give shade over<br>\
him, or it,] (M,) inf. n. تَظْلِيلٌ. (O.) It is said<br>\
in the Kur [vii. 160, and the like is said in ii. 54],<br>\
وَظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الغَمَامَ And we made the clouds to<br>\
give shade over them. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And ظللّٰهُ signifies He shaded him, or it. See an ex. in a<br>\
verse of Jereer in art. ردف, conj. 3.] لٰكِنْ عَلَى<br>\
الأَثَلَاتِ لَحْمٌ لَا يُظَلَّلُ [But at the tamarisk-trees<br>\
is flesh that will not be shaded, or, accord. to<br>\
the reading given by Meyd, بِالأَثَلَاتِ,] is a prov.,<br>\
said by Beyhes, in allusion to the flesh of his<br>\
slain brothers, on the occasion of persons saying,<br>\
ظَلِّلُوا لَحْمَ جَزُورِكُمْ [Shade ye the flesh of your<br>\
slaughtered camel]. (S, O.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 4.<br>\
-A3-<br>\
One says also ظلّل بِالسَّوْطِ, meaning He made<br>\
a sign with the whip for the purpose of frightening. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اظلّ, said of a day, It was, (S, O,) or<br>\
became, (M, K,) shady, or a day having shade:<br>\
(S, M, O, K:) or it was a day having clouds, or<br>\
other [causes of shade]: (T:) or it was continually<br>\
shady; as also ↓ ظَلَّ, aor. يَظِلُّ, inf. n. ظِلَالَةٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, said of a thing, [It extended its<br>\
shade; or] its shade extended; as also ↓ ظلّل.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  أَظَلَّتْنِى الشَّجَرَةُ [The tree shaded me,<br>\
or afforded me shade]: and in like manner one<br>\
says of other things than trees. (S, O.) أَظَلَّكَ<br>\
said of a building, or of a mountain, or of a<br>\
cloud, means It protected thee, and cast its shade<br>\
upon thee. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اظلّهُ (assumed tropical:)  He took<br>\
him into his shelter, or protection: (TA:) or he<br>\
guarded, or protected, him, and placed him within<br>\
the scope of his might, or power of resistance or<br>\
defence. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And أَظَلَّنِى (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
(a thing) covered me: (M, K:) or it approached<br>\
me, or drew near to me, so as to cast its shade<br>\
upon me: (K:) or it has both of these meanings:<br>\
(M:) or أَظَلَّكَ means he, (T, S,) or it, (O,)<br>\
approached thee, or drew near to thee, as though<br>\
he, or it, cast his, or its, shade upon thee. (T, S,<br>\
O.) And hence one says, أَظَلَّكَ أَمْرٌ (assumed tropical:)  An event<br>\
approached thee, or drew near to thee: (S, O:)<br>\
and in like manner one says of a month. (T, S,<br>\
O.) And اظلّ [alone] (assumed tropical:)  It (a thing) advanced:<br>\
or approached, or drew near. (Msb.) And i. q.<br>\
أَشْرَفَ [app. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, became<br>\
within sight, or view]. (Msb.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَظَلَّ3َ see the next paragraph. It is also pronounced تَظَلَّى: (IAar, T:) and signifies He<br>\
kept to shady places, and to ease, or repose:<br>\
(IAar, T and K in art. ظلى:) it is like تَظَنَّيْتُ<br>\
from الظَّنُّ. (T in that art.)<br>\
10<br>\
استظلّ, (T,) or استظلّ بِالِظِّلِّ, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
He (a man, T) sheltered, or protected, himself by<br>\
means of the shade: (T, TA:) or the latter<br>\
means he inclined to the shade and sat in it.<br>\
(M, K.) And استظلّ مِنَ الشَّىْءِ and بِهِ means<br>\
↓ تَظَلَّلَ [i. e. he shaded himself (تظلّل being<br>\
quasi-pass. of ظَلَّلَهُ) from the thing and by means<br>\
of it]. (M, K.) You say, استظلّ بِهِ مِنَ الشَّمْسِ<br>\
[He shaded himself with it, or by means of it,<br>\
from the sun]. (T.) And استظلّ بِالشَّجَرَةِ He<br>\
shaded and sheltered himself by means of the tree.<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  استظلّ الدَّمُ The blood<br>\
was in the جَوْف [or belly, or interior of the belly,<br>\
or the chest]. (T, O, K, TA. [In the CK, من<br>\
الجَوْفِ is put for فِى الجَوْفِ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  استظلّت العَيْنُ,<br>\
(T, Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,) or العُيُونُ, (K,) The eye, (T,<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,) meaning that of a she-camel,<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,) or the eyes, (K,) sank, or became depressed, in the head. (T, Ibn-&#39;Abbád,<br>\
O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And استظلّ الكَرْمُ The grape-vine<br>\
became luxuriant, or abundant and dense, in its<br>\
branches whereon were the bunches. (M, K.)<br>\
ظِلٌّ properly signifies Shade; i. e. the light of<br>\
the sun without the rays: when there is no light,<br>\
it is ظُلْمَةٌ, not ظِلٌّ: (S, O:) contr. of ضِحٌّ: (M,<br>\
K:) or i. q. فَىْءٌ: (K:) so some say: (M:) or<br>\
so the [common] people say: (IKt, Msb:) or<br>\
the former is [shade] in the morning; and the<br>\
latter is in the evening: (M, K:) or, accord.<br>\
to IKt, the former is in the morning and in the<br>\
evening; but the latter is only after the declining<br>\
of the sun from the meridian: ISk says that the<br>\
former is from the rising of the sun to its declining;<br>\
and the latter, from the declining to the setting:<br>\
Th says that the ظِلّ of a tree &amp;c. is in the morning; and the فَىْء, in the evening: (Msb:) Ru-beh<br>\
says, (M, Msb,) any place, (M,) or any thing,<br>\
(Msb,) upon which the sun has been and which<br>\
it has quitted is termed ظِلٌّ and فَىْءٌ; (M, Msb;)<br>\
but a thing [or place] upon which the sun has not<br>\
been is termed ظِلٌّ [only]; and hence it is said<br>\
that the sun annuls, or supersedes, the ظِلّ, and<br>\
the فَىْء annuls, or supersedes, the sun: (Msb:)<br>\
AHeyth says, the ظِلّ is anything upon which the<br>\
sun has not come; and the term فَىْء is applied<br>\
only after the declining of the sun; the فَىْء<br>\
being eastwards and the ظِلّ being westwards;<br>\
and the ظِلّ being termed ظِلّ from the beginning<br>\
of the day to the declining of the sun; after which<br>\
it is termed فَىْء until the night: (T, TA:) one<br>\
says the ظِلّ of Paradise, but not its فَىْء, because<br>\
the sun will never replace its ظِلّ; but En-Nábighah<br>\
El-Jaadee has assigned to Paradise فَىْء having<br>\
ظِلَال: (M, TA:) in a verse of Aboo-Sakhr ElHudhalee, ظِلٌّ is made fem. as meaning مَنِيَّة [i. e.<br>\
death]: (Ham p. 161:) the pl. [of mult.] is ظِلَالٌ<br>\
(S, M, O, K) and ظُلُولٌ and [of pauc.] أَظْلَالٌ.<br>\
(M, O, K.) The saying of a rájiz,<br>\
كَأَنَّمَا وَجْهُكَ ظِلٌّ مِنْ حَجَرْ<br>\
[As though thy face were a shade of a stone] is<br>\
said to mean hardness of face, and shamelessness:<br>\
or the being black in the face: (T, TA:) for the<br>\
Arabs say that there is nothing more dense in<br>\
shade than a stone. (TA.) قَدْ ضَحَا ظِلُّهُ [His<br>\
shade, or shadow, has become sun] is said of the<br>\
dead. (TA.) مَرَّ بِنَا كَأَنَّهُ ظِلُّ ذِئْبٍ [He passed<br>\
by us as though he were the shadow of a wolf]<br>\
means swiftly, as does a wolf. (M.) اِنْتَعَلَتْ<br>\
ظِلَالَهَا (assumed tropical:)  [They made their shadows to be as<br>\
though they were sandals to them] is said of<br>\
camels or other beasts when it is midday in<br>\
summer and they have no shadow [but such as is<br>\
beneath them]: a rájiz says,<br>\
قَدْ وَرَدَتْ تَمْشِى عَلَى ظِلَالِهَا<br>\
وَذَابَتِ الشَّمْسُ عَلَى قِلَالِهَا<br>\
[They came to the water walking upon their<br>\
shadows, and the sun was intensely hot upon the<br>\
tops of their heads and humps]. (T.) And one<br>\
says, هُوَ يَتْبَعُ ظِلَّ نَفْسِهِ (tropical:)  [He follows the shadow<br>\
of himself; i. e. a thing that he will not overtake;<br>\
for], as a poet says, the shadow that goes with<br>\
thee thou wilt not overtake by following: and<br>\
هُوَ يُبَارِى ظِلَّ نَفْسِهِ (tropical:)  [He strives to outstrip the<br>\
shadow of himself], meaning that he walks with a<br>\
proud and self-conceited gait: so in the A.<br>\
(TA.) And اِنْتَقَلْتُ عَنْ ظِلِّى (tropical:)  I left my state,<br>\
or condition. (TA.) And تَرَكَ الظَّبْىُ ظِلَّهُ: so<br>\
in the T and S and O: (TA:) but [said to be]<br>\
correctly, أَتْرُكُهُ تَرْكَ الظَّبْىِ ظِلَّهُ, (K,) or لَأَتْرُكَنَّهُ,<br>\
(M, TA,) i. e. [I will forsake him, or I will<br>\
assuredly forsake him, as the gazelle forsakes] the<br>\
place of its shade: (O, TA:) [each, however,<br>\
is app. right; and the former is the more agreeable with the following explanations:] a prov.,<br>\
(M,) applied to the man who is wont to take<br>\
fright and flee; for the gazelle, when it takes<br>\
fright and flees from a thing, never returns to<br>\
it: (S, O, K:) by the ظِلّ is here meant the<br>\
covert in which it shades and shelters itself in the<br>\
vehemence of the heat; then the hunter comes to<br>\
it and rouses it, and it will not return thither;<br>\
and one says, تَرَكَ الظَّبْىُ ظِلَّهُ, meaning the place<br>\
of its shade: it is applied to him who takes fright<br>\
and flees from a thing, and forsakes it so as not<br>\
to return to it; and to the case of a man&#39;s forsaking his companion. (Meyd.) [ثَقِيلُ الظِّلِّ as<br>\
applied to a man, see expl. in art. ثقل: see<br>\
also Har p. 250, where it is indicated that it may<br>\
be rendered One whose shadow, even, is oppressive,<br>\
and therefore much more so is his person.] In the<br>\
phrase وَلَا الظِّلُّ وَلَا الْحَرُورُ, (M, K) in the Kur<br>\
[xxxv. 20], Th says, accord. to some, (M,) الظِّلُّ<br>\
means Paradise; (M, K;) and الحَرُورُ, the fire<br>\
[of Hell]: but he adds, I say that الظِّلُّ is the ظِلّ<br>\
itself [i. e. shade], and الحَرُورُ is the حَرّ itself [i. e.<br>\
heat]: (M: [see also حَرُورٌ:]) and Er-Rághib<br>\
says that ظِلٌّ is sometimes assigned to anything;<br>\
whether it be approved, as in the phrase above<br>\
mentioned; or disapproved, as in وَظِلٍّ مِنْ يَحْمُومٍ<br>\
in the Kur [lvi. 42, meaning And shade of smoke,<br>\
or black smoke]. (TA.) And الظِّلَالُ means<br>\
ظِلَالُ الجَنَّةِ [The shades of Paradise]: (Fr, T,<br>\
O, K, TA:) in some copies of the K, وَالظِّلَالُ<br>\
الجَنَّةُ, which is a mistake: (TA:) [but this<br>\
requires consideration; for] El-&#39;Abbás Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abd-El-Muttalib says,<br>\
مِنْ قَبْلِهَا طِبْتَ فِى الظِّلَالِ وَفِى<br>\
مُسْتَوْدَعٍ حَيْثُ يُخْصَفُ الوَرَقُ<br>\
[Before it t?? wast good in, or in the shades of,<br>\
Paradise, and in a depositary in the part where<br>\
leaves are sewed together to conceal the pudenda];<br>\
(T, O, TA;) i. e. before thy descent to the earth<br>\
(to which the pronoun in قبلها relates), thou wast<br>\
good in the loins of Adam when he was in<br>\
Paradise. (TA.) الجَنَّةُ تَحْتَ ظِلَالِ السُّيُوفِ<br>\
[Paradise is beneath the shades of the swords] is a<br>\
trad., meaning that fighting against unbelievers<br>\
is a way of attaining to Paradise. (Marg. note<br>\
in a copy of the “ Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer.) مُلَاعِبُ ظِلِّهِ<br>\
is an appellation of A certain bird; [see art.<br>\
لعب;] and one says مُلَاعِبَا ظِلِّهِمَا; and مُلَاعِبَاتُ<br>\
ظِلِّهِنَّ: but when you make them indeterminate,<br>\
you say مُلَاعِبَاتُ أَظْلَالِهِنَّ. (T, O, K. [But in<br>\
the TA in art. لعب, it is said that one dualizes<br>\
and pluralizes both nouns, because the appellation<br>\
becomes determinate.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  ظِلُّ اللَّيْلِ means<br>\
(tropical:)  The blackness of the night: (T, S, O, Msb;)<br>\
metaphorically thus termed; (S;) as in the saying, أَتَانَا فِى ظِلِّ اللَّيْلِ [He came to us in the<br>\
blackness of the night]: (S, O:) or it signifies<br>\
جُنْحُ اللَّيْلِ [app. as meaning the darkness, and<br>\
confusedness, of the night; see جُنْحٌ]; (M, TA;)<br>\
or so الظِّلُّ: (K:) or this means the night, (M,<br>\
K, TA,) itself; (M, TA;) so the astronomers<br>\
say: (TA:) all the night is ظِلٌّ: and so is all<br>\
the period from the shining of the dawn to the<br>\
rising of the sun. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ظِلُّ النَّهَارِ is The colour<br>\
of the day when the sun predominates over it [app.<br>\
meaning when the light of the sun predominates<br>\
over that of the early dawn]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  ظِلُّ<br>\
السَّحَابِ means Such, of the clouds, as conceal the<br>\
sun: or the blackness of the clouds. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And ظِلَالُ البَحْرِ means The waves of the sea;<br>\
(O, K, TA;) because they are raised so as to<br>\
shade the ship and those that are in it. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  ظِلٌّ also signifies A خَيَال (M, O, K) that is<br>\
seen, (M, K,) [i. e. an apparition, a phantom, or<br>\
a thing that one sees like a shadow, i. e. what we<br>\
term a shade,] of the jinn, or genii, and of others:<br>\
(M, O, K:) or the like of a خَيَال of the jinn.<br>\
(T.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Also Anything that shades one. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  And it is the subst. from أَظَلَّنِى الشَّىْءُ meaning “ the thing covered me; ” (M, K;) [i. e. it<br>\
means A covering;] in which sense Th explains<br>\
it in the phrase إِلَى ظِلٍّ ذِى ثَلَاثِ شُعَبٍ [in the<br>\
Kur lxxvii. 30, Unto a covering having three<br>\
parts, or divisions]; saying, the meaning is that<br>\
the fire will have covered them; not that its<br>\
ظِلّ will be like that of the present world. (M.<br>\
[See شُعْبَةٌ.]) And ظِلُّ الشَّىْءِ means (assumed tropical:)  That which<br>\
serves for the veiling, covering, or protecting, of<br>\
the thing; syn. كِنُّهُ. (M.) [Hence] one says,<br>\
فُلَانٌ يَعِيشُ فِى ظِلِّ فُلَانٍ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one lives]<br>\
in the shelter, or protection, of such a one. (T, *<br>\
S, O, Msb, * K. *) And السُّلْطَانُ ظِلُّ اللّٰهِ فِى الأَرْضِ,<br>\
(O, TA,) a saying of the Prophet, (O,) [meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The sovereign, or ruling, power is God&#39;s means<br>\
of defence in the earth,] because he wards off<br>\
harm from the people like as the ظِلّ [properly<br>\
so called] wards off the harm of the heat of the<br>\
sun: (TA:) or the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  God&#39;s means<br>\
of protection: or God&#39;s خَاصَّة [or special<br>\
servant]. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Might; or power<br>\
of resistance or defence: (M, K, TA:) whence<br>\
[as some say] its usage in the Kur xiii. 35, and<br>\
the usage of [the pl.] ظِلَال in xxxvi. 56 and in<br>\
lxxvii. 41: [but the primary signification is more<br>\
appropriate in these instances:] and so in the<br>\
saying, جَعَلَنِى فِى ظِلِّهِ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He placed me<br>\
within the scope of his might, or power of resistance or defence]: so says Er-Rághib. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
And (assumed tropical:)  A state of life ample in its means or<br>\
circumstances, unstraitened, or plentiful, and easy,<br>\
pleasant, soft, or delicate. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
beginning of winter. (T, O. [Accord. to the<br>\
copies of the K, of youthfulness: but I think<br>\
that الشَّبَاب in this instance, in the K, is evidently<br>\
a mistranscription for الشِّتَآء.]) And (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
vehemence (T, O, K) of the heat (T, O) of<br>\
summer. (T, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b12-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The شَخْص [as<br>\
meaning person of a human being, and as meaning the bodily or corporeal form or figure or substance which one sees from a distance, or the<br>\
material substance,] of anything; (M, K, TA;<br>\
[in the second and third of which is added, “or<br>\
its كِنّ,” a signification which I have mentioned<br>\
above on the authority of the M;]) because of<br>\
its [apparent] blackness [or darkness, resembling<br>\
that of a shade or shadow]: (M, TA:) whence<br>\
the saying, لَا يُفَارِقُ ظِلِّى ظِلَّكَ (assumed tropical:)  [My person will<br>\
not quit thy person]; like the saying, لَا يُفَارِقُ<br>\
سَوَادِى سَوَادَكَ: and the following exs. have been<br>\
cited as instances of ظِلّ in the sense of شَخْص:<br>\
the saying of a poet,<br>\
لَمَّا نَزَلْنَا رَفَعْنَا ظِلَّ أَخْبِيَةٍ<br>\
[as though meaning When we alighted, we raised<br>\
the material fabric of tents], for it is said that<br>\
they do not set up the ظِلّ which is the فَىْء, but<br>\
they only set up the tents; and the saying of<br>\
another,<br>\
تَتَبَّعَ أَفْيَآءَ الظِّلَالِ عَشِيَّةً<br>\
[as though meaning He followed the shadows of<br>\
the material objects in the evening]: but Er-Rághib says that the former means, we raised<br>\
the tents, and so raised the ظِلّ thereof; and in<br>\
the other ex., الظلال is a general term, and الفَىْء<br>\
[or افيآء] is a special term, so that it is an<br>\
instance of the إِضَافَة of a thing to its kind [i. e.<br>\
of prefixing a noun to one significant of its kind].<br>\
(TA.) [See also ظَلَالَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b13-  And accord. to Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, (O,) it signifies also The nap, or villous<br>\
substance, upon the surface of a garment, or piece<br>\
of cloth; syn. زِئْبِرٌ. (O, K.)<br>\
ظَلَّةٌ i. q. إِقَامَةٌ [Continuance, residence, abode,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. صِحَّةٌ: thus accord. to<br>\
the copies of the K; but this may be a mistranscription; for Az and others mention, among the<br>\
significations of ظلّة, [in a copy of the T, written<br>\
in this case, as in others, ↓ ظُلَّة,] that of صَيْحَةٌ<br>\
[q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
ظُلَّةٌ A thing that covers, or protects, [or shades,]<br>\
one, overhead: accord. to Lth, i. q. ↓ مَظَلَّةٌ or<br>\
مِظَلَّةٌ meaning a thing that shades one from the<br>\
sun: (T:) see an ex. voce مِظَلَّةٌ: a covering:<br>\
and i. q. بُرْطُلَّةٌ: (M, K:) this latter word correctly signifies a مِظَلَّة for the summer: (TA in<br>\
art. برطل:) and a thing by which one is protected<br>\
from the cold and the heat: (M:) anything that<br>\
protects and shades one, as a building or a mountain or a cloud: (Mgh:) the first portion that<br>\
shades (AZ, S, K) of a cloud (AZ, S) or of<br>\
clouds; (K;) accord. to Er-Rághib, mostly said<br>\
of that which is deemed unwholesome, and which<br>\
is disliked; whence the use of the word in the<br>\
Kur vii. 170: (TA:) and what shades one, of<br>\
trees: (K:) or anything that forms a covering<br>\
over one, (T, TA,) or shades one: (T:) and<br>\
[particularly] a thing like the صُفَّة [q. v.], (S,<br>\
M, O, K,) by which one protects himself from the<br>\
heat and the cold: (K:) or, accord. to the<br>\
lawyers, ظُلَّةُ الدَّارِ means the سُدَّة [or projecting<br>\
roof] over the door of the house: or that of which<br>\
the beams have one end upon the house and the<br>\
other end upon the wall of the opposite neighbour:<br>\
(Mgh:) pl. ظُلَلٌ (S, M, O, K) and ظِلَالٌ. (M,<br>\
K.) [See also ظَلَالٌ.] One says also, دَامَتْ ظُلَّةُ<br>\
الظِّلِّ and الظِّلِّ ↓ ظِلَالَةُ, meaning That whereby<br>\
one shades himself, (K, TA,) of trees, or of stones,<br>\
or of other things, (TA,) [continued.] عَذَابُ يَوْمِ<br>\
الظُّلَّةِ, in the Kur. [xxvi. 189], is said to mean<br>\
[The punishment of the day of] clouds beneath<br>\
which was a hot wind (سَمُوم): (S, O, K:) or<br>\
an overshadowing cloud, beneath which they collected themselves together, seeking protection thereby<br>\
from the heat that came upon them, whereupon<br>\
it covered them, (T, * K, TA,) and they perished<br>\
beneath it: (T, TA:) or, accord. to some, i. q.<br>\
عَذَابُ يَوْمِ الصُّفَّةِ. (T: see art. صف.) And<br>\
لَهُمْ مِنْ فَوْقِهِمْ ظُلَلٌ مِنَ النَّارِ وَمِنْ تَحْتِهِمْ ظُلَلٌ, in<br>\
the Kur [xxxix. 18], means To them shall be<br>\
above them coverings of fire, and beneath them<br>\
coverings to those below them; Hell consisting<br>\
of stages, one beneath another. (T, TA.) Seditions, or conflicts and factions, are mentioned in<br>\
a trad. as being like ظُلَل, by which are meant<br>\
Mountains, and clouds: and El-Kumeyt likens<br>\
waves of the sea to ظُلَل. (TA.) And [the pl.]<br>\
ظُلَلٌ is used as meaning The chambers of a<br>\
prison. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also ظَلَّةٌ.<br>\
ظِلَّةٌ i. q. ظِلَالٌ; (T, K, TA;) app. a pl. of<br>\
ظَلِيلٌ, like as طِلَّةٌ is of طَلِيلٌ. (TA.)<br>\
ظَلَلٌ Water that is beneath a tree, (O,) or<br>\
beneath trees, (K,) upon which the sun does not<br>\
come. (O, K.) [See also ضَلَلٌ.]<br>\
ظَلَالٌ, like سَحَابٌ, [so accord. to the K, but<br>\
in my copies of the S, ↓ ظِلَال,] A thing that<br>\
shades one, (IAar, S, O, K, TA,) such as a cloud,<br>\
(IAar, S, TA,) and the like. (IAar, TA.) [See<br>\
also ظُلَّةٌ.]<br>\
ظِلَالٌ pl. of ظِلٌّ: (S, M, O, K:) ―<br>\
-b2-  and of<br>\
ظُلَّةٌ. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Also, app., pl. of ظَلِيلٌ: see<br>\
ظِلَّةٌ. ―<br>\
-b4-  Freytag has app. understood it to be<br>\
expl. in the K as syn. with مَظَلَّةٌ; though it<br>\
certainly is not.] ―<br>\
-b5-  See also ظَلَالٌ.<br>\
مَكَانٌ ظَلِيلٌ A place having shade: (M, K:)<br>\
or having constant shade. (T, S, M, O, K.) And<br>\
hence ظِلٌّ ظَلِيلٌ (M, K) Constant shade: (S:)<br>\
or extensive shade: (O:) or in this case the latter<br>\
word denotes intensiveness [meaning dense]; (M,<br>\
K, TA;) being like شَاعِرٌ in the phrase شِعْرٌ شَاعِرٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ظِلًّا ظَلِيلًا in the Kur iv. 60 is said by<br>\
Er-Rághib to be an allusion to ease and pleasantness of life. (TA.) One says also أَيْكَةٌ ظَلِيلَةٌ<br>\
A collection of trees tangled, or luxuriant, or<br>\
abundant and dense. (TA.) In the saying of<br>\
Uheyhah Ibn-El-Juláh, describing palm-trees,<br>\
هِىَ الظِّلُّ فِى الحَرِّ حَقَّ الظَّلِ??<br>\
??لِ وَالمَنْظَرُ الأَحْسَنُ الأَجْمَلُ<br>\
[ISd says] in my opinion, he means الشَّىْءُ الظَّلِيلُ<br>\
حَقَّ الظَّلِيلِ; [so that the verse should be rendered<br>\
They are the shade in the heat, the shady thing,<br>\
the extremely shady, and the most goodly, the most<br>\
beautiful, thing at which one looks; (see the<br>\
phrase هٰذَا العَالِمُ حَقَّ العَالِمِ, voce حَقٌّ;)] the<br>\
inf. n. being put in the place of the subst. (M.)<br>\
لَا ظَلِيلٍ in the Kur [lxxvii. 31] means Not<br>\
profitable as the shade in protecting from the<br>\
heat. (TA.)<br>\
ظَلَالَةٌ, (M, TA,) with fet-h, (TA,) the subst.<br>\
from the verb in the phrase ظَلَّلْنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الغَمَامَ<br>\
[expl. above, see 2; as such app. meaning either<br>\
The making to give shade, like the inf. n. تَظْلِيلٌ,<br>\
or a thing that gives shade, like ظِلَالَةٌ]. (M,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. شَخْصٌ [expl. above, see ظِلٌّ,<br>\
last quarter]: (O, K:) and so طَلَالَةٌ, with ط. (O.)<br>\
ظِلَالَةٌ: see ظُلَّةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A cloud that one sees<br>\
by itself, and of which one sees the shadow upon<br>\
the earth. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And one says, رَأَيْتُ ظِلَالَةً<br>\
مِنَ الطَّيْرِ i. e. غَيَابَةً [app. meaning I saw a<br>\
covert, or place of concealment, of birds]. (TA.)<br>\
ظَلِيلَةٌ A place in which a little water collects<br>\
and stagnates in a water-course and the like:<br>\
(Lth, T:) or a place in which water collects and<br>\
stagnates in the lower part of the torrent of a<br>\
valley: (M, K:) or the like of an excavated<br>\
hollow in the interior of a water-course, such that<br>\
the water stops, and remains therein: (AA, O:)<br>\
pl. ظَلَائِلُ. (Lth, AA, T, O.) And A meadow<br>\
(رَوْضَة) abounding with collections of trees, or of<br>\
dense and tangled trees: (AA, T, O, K:) pl. as<br>\
above. (K.)<br>\
ظُلَّيْلَةٌ A thing which a man makes for himself,<br>\
of trees, or of a garment, or piece of cloth, by<br>\
which to protect himself from the heat of the sun:<br>\
a vulgar word. (TA.)<br>\
ظُلْظُلٌ i. q. سُعْنٌ, i. e. A ↓ مِظَلَّة [q. v.; or as<br>\
expl. in the L, in art. سعن, a ظُلَّة (q. v.), or a<br>\
thing like the ظُلَّة, which is made upon the flat<br>\
house-tops, for the purpose of guarding against<br>\
the dew that comes from the direction of the sea in<br>\
the time of the greatest heat]; on the authority of<br>\
IAar. (T. [Accord. to the O and K, i. q. سُفُنٌ,<br>\
which is evidently a mistranscription.])<br>\
أَظَلُّ [More, and most, dense in shade]. The<br>\
Arabs say, لَيْسَ شَىْءٌ أَظَلَّ مِنْ حَجَرٍ [There is not<br>\
anything more dense in shade than a stone].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And أَظَلّ, [as a subst., i. e. أَظَلٌّ<br>\
accord. to a general rule, or, if regarded as originally an epithet, it may be أَظَلُّ,] by poetic<br>\
license أَظْلَل, (S, M, O, K,) signifies The under<br>\
part, (S, O,) or the concealed part, (M, AHei,<br>\
K,) of the مَنْسِم, (S, M, O, K,) or of the خُفّ,<br>\
(AHei, TA,) [the former app. here used, as it is<br>\
said be in other cases, in the same sense as the<br>\
latter, meaning the foot,] of the camel; (S, M,<br>\
O, AHei, K;) so called because of its being<br>\
concealed: (AHei, TA:) and, (M, K,) in a<br>\
human being, (M,) الأَظَلُّ signifies بَطْنُ الإِصْبَعِ;<br>\
(M, K;) and [ISd says] this is in my opinion<br>\
the right explanation; but it is said that أَظَلُّ<br>\
الإِنْسَانِ signifies بُطُونُ أَصَابِعِهِ, which means the<br>\
portion, of what is next to the fore part [of the<br>\
bottom] of the foot, from the root of the great toe<br>\
to the root of the little toe, of the human being:<br>\
(M:) the pl. is ظُلٌّ, which is anomalous, (M,<br>\
K,) or formed after the manner of the pl. of an<br>\
epithet: (M:) or الظُّلُّ فِى الإِنْسَانِ means the<br>\
roots, or bases, (أُصُول) of what are termed بُطُونُ<br>\
الأَصَابِعِ, next to the fore part [of the bottom] of<br>\
the foot. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.) Hence the prov.,<br>\
إِنْ يَدْمَ أَظَلُّكَ فَقَدْ نَقِبَ خُفِّى [If the fore part of<br>\
the sole of thy foot be bleeding, the sole of my foot<br>\
has become worn through, in holes: see نَقِبَ]:<br>\
said to the complainer to him who is in a worse<br>\
condition than he. (AHei, TA.)<br>\
مظلّ [app. مَظِلٌّ, being from ظَلَّ of which the<br>\
aor. is يَظِلُّ; A place of shade, or of continual<br>\
shade]. One says, هٰذَا مُنَاخِى وَمَحَلِّى وَبَيْتِى وَمظلِّى<br>\
[This is my nightly resting-place for the camels,<br>\
and my place of abode, and my tent, and my<br>\
place of shade, or of continual shade]. (TA.)<br>\
مُظِلٌّ A thing having shade; by means of which<br>\
one shades himself; as also ↓ مُظَلِّلٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
And [A cloudy day;] a day having clouds: or<br>\
having continual shade. (TA.)<br>\
مِظَلَّةٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and مَظَلَّةٌ, (T, M,<br>\
Msb, K,) the former with kesr to the م as an<br>\
instrumental noun, (Msb,) [and the latter with<br>\
fet-h as a noun of place,] A large tent of [goats&#39;]<br>\
hair; (S, O, Msb;) more ample than the خِبَآء;<br>\
so says El-Fárábee: (Msb:) one of the kinds of<br>\
tents of the Arabs of the desert, the largest of the<br>\
tents of [goats&#39;] hair; next after which is the<br>\
وَسُوط; and then, the خِبَآء, which is the smallest<br>\
of the tents of [goats&#39;] hair; so says AZ: but<br>\
Aboo-Málik says that the مظلّة and the خبآء are<br>\
small and large: IAar says that the خَيْمَة is of<br>\
poles roofed with [the panic grass called] ثَمَام,<br>\
and is not of cloths; but the مظلّة is of cloths:<br>\
(T:) or it is of the tents called أَخْبِيَة; (M;) such<br>\
as is large, of the أَخْبِيَة; (K;) and it is said to<br>\
be only of cloths; and it is large, having a رِوَاق<br>\
[q. v.]; but sometimes it is of one oblong piece of<br>\
cloth (شُقَّة), and of two such pieces, and of three;<br>\
and sometimes it has a كِفَآء, which is its hinder<br>\
part: or, accord. to Th, it is peculiarly of<br>\
[goats&#39;] hair: (M:) see also ظُلَّةٌ, and ظُلْظُلٌ:<br>\
the pl. is مَظَالُّ; (M, Msb;) and مَظَالِ or مَظَالِى<br>\
occurs at the end of a verse of Umeiyeh Ibn-Abee-&#39;Áïdh El-Hudhalee, for مَظَالِّ; the [latter]<br>\
ل being either elided, or changed into ى. (M.)<br>\
عِلَّةٌ مَا عِلَّةُ أَوْتَادٍ وَأَخِلَّةٍ وَعَمَدِ المِظَلَّةِ اُبْرُزُوا لِصِهْرِكُمْ<br>\
↓ ظُلَّةٌ [A pretext: what is the pretext of tentpegs, and of pins for fastening together the edges<br>\
of the pieces of the tent-cloth, and of the poles of<br>\
the large tent? go ye forth: he who has married<br>\
among you has a tent for shade from the sun:] is<br>\
a prov., and was said by a girl who had been<br>\
married to a man, and whose family delayed to<br>\
conduct her to her husband, urging in excuse<br>\
that they had not the apparatus of the tent: she<br>\
said this to urge them, and to put a stop to their<br>\
excuse: (Meyd, TA: *) and the prov. is applied<br>\
in attributing untruth to pretexts. (Meyd.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, as being likened thereto, (assumed tropical:)  A booth, or<br>\
shed, made of palm-sticks, and covered with [the<br>\
panic grass called] ثُمَام. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The<br>\
thing [i. e. umbrella] by means of which kings are<br>\

copy of the T, but in the TA المُسْتَظِلُّ,] to<br>\
Certain thin flesh, adhering to the interior of the<br>\

in the flesh of the camel none thinner, nor any<br>\
softer, but there is in it no grease. (T.)<br>\
