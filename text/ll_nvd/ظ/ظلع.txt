ظَلَعَ, aor.<br>\
ظَلَعَ, inf. n. ظَلْعٌ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) said of a camel, (S, O, Msb, K,) and of a<br>\
man also, (Msb, TA,) and, by Aboo-Dhu-eyb,<br>\
of a horse, (S, TA,) [and likewise said of a dog,<br>\
(see ظَالِعٌ,)] He limped, or halted, syn. غَمَزَ فِى<br>\
مَشْيِهِ, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) and عَرِجَ; (TA;) or<br>\
was slightly lame: (Mgh:) what it signifies<br>\
resembles عَرَجٌ [or natural lameness], and therefore<br>\
it is said to be a slight عَرَج. (Msb.) One says,<br>\
اِرْقَ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ, (S, O, L, K,) a prov., (O, L,)<br>\
meaning Ascend thou the mountain with knowledge<br>\
[or because] of thy limping, or slight lameness, not<br>\
jading thyself: (L:) or deal gently with thyself, and<br>\
burden not thyself with more than thou art able to<br>\
do: (S:) or impose upon thyself, of what is difficult,<br>\
[only] what thou art able to do; for he who ascends<br>\
a ladder or stair, or a mountain, when he is one<br>\
who limps, or has a slight lameness, deals gently<br>\
with himself; i. e. exceed not thy proper limit in<br>\
thy threatening, but see thy deficiency, and thine<br>\
impotence to execute it: (O, K: *) and some say<br>\
اِرْقَأْ, with, meaning rectify thine affair first;<br>\
(O, K;) or as meaning abstain, and restrain<br>\
thyself; (O;) or, accord. to AZ, abstain thou,<br>\
for I know thy vices, or faults: (TA:) or the<br>\
meaning of both is, be silent, because, or in consideration, of the fault that is in thee. (Ks, O,<br>\
K. *) One says also, اِرْقِ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ, with kesr<br>\
to the ق, [meaning Charm thou thy slight lameness, to cure it,] from الرُّقْيَةُ: and it is said in<br>\
another prov.,<br>\
اِرْقِ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ أَنْ يُهَاضَا<br>\
[app. meaning Charm thou thy slight lameness,<br>\
that it may become mitigated: see art. هيض: the<br>\
final ا in يهاضا being what is termed أَلِفُ الإِطْلَاقِ,<br>\
not a radical]. (O, K.) And قِ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ [Be<br>\
cautious, because, or in consideration, of thy<br>\
limping]: said when there is a vice, or fault, in<br>\
a man, and you chide him in order that it may<br>\
not be called to mind: (O, K: [for يَذْكُرَ in the<br>\
CK, I read يُذْكَرَ, as in other copies of the K<br>\
and in the O:]) and to this he replies, or may<br>\
reply, وَقَيْتُ. (TA. [See also art. وقى.]) And<br>\
اِرْبَعْ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ [Act gently, or with deliberation,<br>\
or restrain thyself, because of thy limping];<br>\
meaning thou art weak; therefore refrain from<br>\
that which thou art not able to do. (O, K. [See<br>\
also art. ربع.]) And لَا يَرْبَعُ عَلَى ظَلْعِكَ مَنْ لَيْسَ<br>\
يَحْزُنُهُ أَمْرُكَ, meaning He will not mind thine<br>\
affair (Hr, O, K) whom thy condition does not<br>\
grieve: (Hr, O:) or, originally, he will not pause<br>\
because of thy limping, when thou laggest behind<br>\
thy companions on account of thy weakness, who<br>\
does not care for thy case. (Hr, O, K. * [See,<br>\
again, art. ربع.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, said of a man, (tropical:)  He<br>\
stopped short, and lagged behind. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
ظَلَعَتِ الأَرْضُ بِأَهْلِهَا (tropical:)  The land became straitened<br>\
with its inhabitants, by reason of their multitude;<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S, O, K;) it would not bear them, by<br>\
reason of their multitude, like the beast that limps<br>\
with its load because of its heaviness. (Z, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  ظَلَعَت said of a bitch, (tropical:)  She desired copulation.<br>\
(As, O, K, TA.) And ظَلَعَ said of a dog, (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
desired to copulate. (TA.)<br>\

(a woman) contracted and inclined her eye.<br>\

rode, to limp, or become lame. (A, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَظَلَّعَ In the following saying of a poet,<br>\
وَمَا ذَاكَ مِنْ جُرْمٍ أَتَيْتُهُمُ بِهِ<br>\
وَلَا حَسَدٍ مِنِّى لَهُمْ يَتَظَلَّعُ<br>\
ISd thinks the meaning to be, [And that was not<br>\
a crime, or an offence, that I committed against<br>\
them, nor envy on my part] arising in their<br>\
minds, and occurring hastily to their understandings. (TA.)<br>\
ظَلَعٌ, thus with fet-h to the ل, A declining from<br>\
the truth, or from that which is right; and a sin,<br>\
crime, fault, or misdeed. (TA.)<br>\
ظُلَاعٌ A disease in the legs of a beast, not from<br>\
journeying nor from fatigue, (Lth, K, TA, [in<br>\
the O inadvertently written ضُلَاع,]) in consequence of which it limps. (Lth, TA.)<br>\
ظَالِعٌ Limping, or halting; [or slightly lame;]<br>\
applied to a camel, and a horse, [&amp;c.,] (S,)<br>\
[i. e.,] to a beast, (TA,) to the male and the<br>\
female alike, (Lth, O, K, TA,) to the former as<br>\
a part. n., and to the latter as a possessive noun,<br>\
(TA,) like غَامِزٌ; (Lth, O, TA;) or the fem. of<br>\
ظَالِعٌ is ظَالِعَةٌ, (S, O, K, TA,) but one does not<br>\
say غَامِزَةٌ: (O, TA:) [pl. ظُلَّعٌ.] One says, لَا<br>\
أَنَامُ حَتَّى يَنَامَ ظَالِعُ الكِلَابِ [I will not sleep until<br>\
the limping dog sleeps]; (O, K;) a prov., (O,)<br>\
meaning, until the dogs become still; (O, K;)<br>\
because the ظالع, of dogs, waits until there remains none other, and then copulates, and sleeps:<br>\
(As, O, K:) ―<br>\
-b2-  or the ظالع is the dog that is<br>\
lusting for the female; for such does not sleep;<br>\
and the saying is applied to him who is mindful<br>\
of his affair, who does not neglect it: ―<br>\
-b3-  or the<br>\
bitch that is lusting for the male; because the<br>\
dogs follow her, and will not let her sleep. (O,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also Inclining, or declining: (O, K:)<br>\
like ضَالِعٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And [Declining from the<br>\
truth, or from that which is right; (see ظَلَعٌ;)]<br>\
committing a sin, crime, fault, or misdeed. (TA.)<br>\

-A2-  In the saying<br>\
of Ru-beh,<br>\
فَإِنْ تُخَالِجْنَ العُيُونَ الظُّلَّعَا<br>\

like, as meaning That limps, or halts, much].<br>\
