part, in two places.<br>\
6<br>\
تظافروا عَلَيْهِ and<br>\
تضافروا and تظاهروا all<br>\
signify the same; so says Ibn-Buzurj; (T, TA;)<br>\
explaining the meaning to be, They leagued together, and aided one another, against him; i. e.<br>\
عَلَى فُلَانٍ [against such a one]: (TA in art.<br>\
ضفر:) the first of these has been said to be incorrect; but it is mentioned also by Sgh, as syn.<br>\
with the third; and by Ibn-Málik, among words<br>\
that are with ض and with ظ. (TA in the<br>\
present art.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِظْتَفَرَ see 2, in three places:<br>\
-A2-  and see also 1, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
ظَفْرٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
ظُفْرٌ (T, S, M, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ ظُفُرٌ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) which latter is the most chaste form,<br>\
and the form adopted by the seven readers in the<br>\
Kur vi. 147, and the former is a contraction of<br>\
this, [but is the most common form,] (Msb,) and<br>\
↓ ظِفْرٌ, which is extr., (M, Msb, K,) and disallowed by IDrd, (O,) and ↓ ظِفِرٌ, which is also<br>\
extr., (Msb,) and ↓ أُظْفُورٌ, (T, M, A, Msb, K,)<br>\
which is erroneously mentioned in the S as a pl.<br>\
of ظُفْرٌ, (Sgh, Msb, K,) by an anticipation of the<br>\
pen; (Msb;) or, accord. to MF, it si said in<br>\
most of the copies of the S, (but this is not the<br>\
case,) ظُفْرٌ has for its pl. أَظْفَارٌ; and أُظْفُورٌ [has<br>\
for its pl.] أَظَافِيرُ; (TA;) [and this, being the<br>\
reading in most of the copies of the S seen by<br>\
MF, is probably what J wrote;] A certain wellknown thing; (M;) [i. e. a nail; and a talon,<br>\
or claw;] pertaining to a human being, (M, Ibn-Es-Seed, Msb, K,) and to others; (M, K;) to<br>\
the beasts and birds mentioned in the next following sentence, [as well as to man,] accord. to the<br>\
authorities there cited; (TA;) and to every<br>\
ruminant, as syn. with ظِلْفٌ [i. e. a cloven hoof]:<br>\
(T and M in art. ظلف:) or to a beast, or bird,<br>\
that does not prey; [as well as to man;] that of<br>\
such as preys being termed مِخْلَبٌ: (M:) [and<br>\
in the present day applied also to the spur of a<br>\
cock:] it is of the masc. gender: (Lh, M, Msb:)<br>\
the pl. (of ظُفْرٌ, S, M, Msb, &amp;c.) is أَظْفَارٌ (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K, &amp;c.) and sometimes أَظْفُرٌ, (Msb,) [both<br>\
of which are pls. of pauc., but the former is used<br>\
as a pl. of mult. also,]. and (of أُظْفُورٌ, M, Msb, or<br>\
of أَظْفَارٌ, and therefore a pl. pl., M) أَظَافِيرُ: (M,<br>\
Msb, K:) that ↓ أُظْفُورٌ is a sing. [and not like<br>\
أُبْقُورٌ which is a quasi-pl. n.] is shown by the<br>\
saying of a poet,<br>\
مَا بَيْنَ لُقْمَتِهَا الأُولَى إِذَا انْحَدَرَتْ<br>\
وَبَيْنَ أُخْرَى تَلِيهَا قِيسُ أُظْفُورِ<br>\
(K) or قِيدُ أُظْفُورِ (Msb) [i. e. What is between<br>\
her first morsel, when it descends into her throat,<br>\
and another that follows it, is the measure of a<br>\
finger-nail]: or, as some relate it, إِذَا ازْدَرَدَتْ<br>\
[when she swallows]; and it is thus cited [in the<br>\
T and] in the “ Basáïr ” of the author of the K.<br>\
(TA.) The phrase كُلَّ ذِى ظُفُرٍ in the Kur<br>\
vi. 147 comprises camels and ostriches; (so in<br>\
the T and TS and L; but in the K, الأَنْعَام is<br>\
erroneously put for النَّعَام; TA;) because their<br>\
مَنَاسِم are like أَظْفَار to them: (T, K, TA:) I&#39;Ab<br>\
says that it comprises camels; and also ostriches,<br>\
because they have nails like camels: or any bird<br>\
that has a مِخْلَب, and any beast that has a solid<br>\
hoof: or, accord. to Mujáhid and Katádeh, every<br>\
beast and bird that has not divided toes; as the<br>\
camel and ostrich and goose and duck. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] الأَظْفَارُ is the name of (assumed tropical:)  Certain<br>\
small stars; (S;) certain stars before النَّسْر<br>\
[meaning النَّسْر الوَاقِع i. e. the star a of Lyra:<br>\
app. because regarded as the talons of the نسر]:<br>\
(K:) or a certain dim star in الشَّلْيَاق [q. v., i. e.<br>\
the constellation Lyra]. (Kzw.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,]<br>\
إِنَّهُ لَكَلِيلُ الظُّفْرِ, (T,) or إِنَّهُ لَمَقْلُومُ الظُّفْرِ, (TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  Verily he is one who does not slay or wound an<br>\
enemy: (T, TA:) and إِنَّهُ مَقْلُومُ الظُّفْرِ عَنْ أَذَى<br>\
النَّاسِ (tropical:)  Verily he is one who does little hurt to<br>\
mankind. (T, A, TA.) And هُوَ كَلِيلُ الظُّفْرِ<br>\
(tropical:)  He is weak, or abject, or despicable; (T, S, K,<br>\
TA;) said of a man; (K, TA;) or so مُقَلَّمُ الظُّفْرِ:<br>\
(K: [in the TA, as from the K, مُقَلَّمُ الأَظْفَارِ:])<br>\
or (tropical:)  he is sick, or diseased. (A.) And بِهِ ظُفْرٌ مِنْ<br>\
مَرَضٍ (tropical:)  [app. meaning In him is an evil result of<br>\
a disease, that has clung to him]. (A, TA.<br>\
[In the A, this immediately follows what here<br>\
next precedes it; and is immediately followed by<br>\
the words وَذُبَابٌ ظَفِرَ مِنْهُ, which seem to be added<br>\
by way of explanation; thus in my copy; but I<br>\
think that ظَفِرَ مِنْهُ here is a mistake for ظَفَّرَ فِيهِ,<br>\
and have assumed this to be the case in rendering<br>\
the phrase.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And قَرَّحْتُهُ مِنْ ظُفْرِهِ إِلَى شُفْرِهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [lit. I wounded him much, from his nail to the<br>\
edge of his eyelid; but mentioned as tropical;<br>\
app. meaning from toe to head]; like as one says,<br>\
مِنْ قَرْنِهِ. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And مَا بَالدَّارِ ظُفْرٌ, (K,) or<br>\
ما بالدار ظُفْرٌ وَلَا شُفْرٌ, (A, O,) (tropical:)  There is not in<br>\
the house any one. (A, O, K.) And مَا تَرَكَتِ<br>\
السَّنَةُ ظُفْرًا وَلَا شُفْرًا (tropical:)  The year of drought left not<br>\
anything: and sometimes they said شَفْرًا, with<br>\
fet-h, and in this case they said ↓ ظَفْرًا, for assimilation. (A in art. شفر.) And رَأَيْتُهُ بِظُفْرِهِ (tropical:)  I<br>\
saw him himself. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  ظُفْرُ النَّسْرِ is the<br>\
name of (assumed tropical:)  A certain plant, (K, TA,) resembling<br>\
what is [properly] thus termed [i. e. the talon of<br>\
the vulture]. (TA.) And ظُفْرُ القِطِّ is the name<br>\
of (assumed tropical:)  Another plant. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And الظُّفْرُ,<br>\
(M,) or الأَظْفَارُ, (T, M, A, Mgh, O, K, &amp;c.,) for<br>\
this word in the sense here following has no sing.<br>\
(T, M, O, K) accord. to the author of the &#39;Eyn,<br>\
(M,) but sometimes one said وَاحِدَةٌ ↓ أَظْفَارَةٌ,<br>\
which is not allowable by rule, and made the pl.<br>\
of this to be أَظَافِيرُ, (T, O, K, * [mentioned in the<br>\
M as a pl. of الظُّفْرُ,]) though, if they formed a<br>\
sing. from it, it should be ظُفْرٌ, (T, O, K,) signifies (tropical:)  A certain odoriferous substance, (T, Mgh,<br>\
O, K,) or a sort thereof, (M,) [i. e. unguis odoratus, (called in the present day ظُفْرُ الطِّيبِ and<br>\
ظُفْرُ العِفْرِيتِ,) or ungues odorati,] black, (T, M,<br>\
O,) resembling a ظُفْر [or nail] (T, M, Mgh, O,<br>\
K) of a man (M) pulled out (in the M and O<br>\
and K مُقْتُلَف, and in the T مُقَلَّف,) from the<br>\
root thereof, (T, M, O, K, [but in the M, the<br>\
words which I have rendered “ pulled out ” &amp;c.<br>\
immediately follow the words ضَرْبٌ مِنَ العِطْرِ<br>\
أَسْوَدُ,]) or resembling the أَظْفَار [or finger-nails],<br>\
(A,) and put into دُخْتَة [or incense]: (T, M, O:)<br>\
and, accord. to the K, ↓ ظَفَارٌ, sometimes imperfectly decl., i. e. ↓ ظَفَارُ, signifies the same; but<br>\
this is very strange, for [SM says] I have referred<br>\
to the M and T and O and other lexicons without<br>\
finding them to have mentioned in this sense any<br>\
term but الأَظْفَارُ or الظُّفْرُ: accord. to the “ Minháj,” أَظْفَارُ الطِّيبِ are pieces of an odoriferous<br>\
substance resembling the أَظْفَار [properly so called];<br>\
they are said by [the Arabic translator of] Dioscorides to be of the nature of the shards of shells,<br>\
[so I render مِنْ جِنْسِ أَخْزَافِ الصَّدَفِ, supposing<br>\
اخزاف to be here used tropically,] found in an<br>\
island of the Sea of India where is the سُنْبُل [or<br>\
spikenard], a sort whereof is [called] قُلْزُمِىّ [i. e.<br>\
of El-Kulzum], and another which is [called]<br>\
بَابِلِىّ [i. e. of Bábil], black and small, and the<br>\
best is that which inclines to whiteness, which<br>\
drifts to El-Yemen and El-Bahreyn. (TA.)<br>\
[Forskål, in his “ Descr. Animalium ” &amp;c., mentions what here follows, among the animal substances of the materia medica of Cairo, in page<br>\
143: “ Unguis odoratus. (Opercula Cochl.) Dofr<br>\
el afrît, ضفر العفريت i. e. unguis dæmonis. E<br>\
Mochha per Sués. Arabes etiam afferunt. Nigritis fumigatorium est. ” (ضفر is here written,<br>\
agreeably with the usual vulgar pronunciation,<br>\
for ظُفْر.) See also قُسْطٌ,] ―<br>\
-b8-  أَظْفَارٌ signifies also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Large قِرْدَان [or ticks]. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The creased parts of a skin. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  And<br>\
the ظُفْر of a bow is (tropical:)  The part in the curved end<br>\

to the extremity: (As, T, S, M, * O, K: *) or the<br>\
end of the bow: (K:) or each end of the bow,<br>\

(A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A man having upon his eye what is<br>\
termed a ظَفَرَة; (A;) and so ↓ مَظْفُورٌ. (T, A,<br>\
Mgh, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَيْنٌ ظَفِرَةٌ An eye having what<br>\
is termed a ظَفَرَة; (T, M, A, K;) as also ↓ مَظْفُورَةٌ.<br>\
(A.)<br>\
-A2-  Also [Successful;] victorious; applied to<br>\
a man; (S;) and so ↓ ظَافِرٌ: (Msb, TA:) or<br>\
ظَفِرٌ (IDrd, M, A, K) and ↓ ظَفِيرٌ (IDrd, M, K)<br>\
and ↓ ظِفِّيرٌ, (IDrd, Sgh, K) but this is said by<br>\
IDrd to be not of established authority, (TA,)<br>\
and ↓ مُظَفَّرٌ (IDrd, M, A, K) and ↓ مِظْفَارٌ,<br>\
(IDrd, O, K,) all signify a man very, or often,<br>\
successful or victorious: (IDrd, O, TA:) or (tropical:)  one<br>\
who does not endeavour after a thing without attaining it. (M, A, K.)<br>\
ظُفُرٌ and ظِفِرٌ: see ظُفْرٌ.<br>\
ظُفْرَةٌ A certain plant, burning, or biting, to<br>\
the tongue, (K, TA,) resembling the ظُفْر [or nail]<br>\

Mgh, O, K,) growing from the side next the nose,<br>\
(T, S, O,) upon the white of the eye, (S, Mgh,<br>\
O,) extending to the black: (S, O:) sometimes<br>\

ظَفَارٌ and ظَفَارُ: see ظُفْرٌ.<br>\
-A2-  [ظَفَارِ is well<br>\
known as the name of a city in El-Yemen; or,<br>\
accord. to the O, of two cities and two fortresses<br>\
in El-Yemen. And accord. to the TA, it signifies Any land that is ذات مَعَزَّة: but the latter of<br>\
these two words has been altered by an erasure<br>\
over the second letter, and is perhaps incorrect:<br>\
if not, it may mean, agreeably with the analogy<br>\
of many words of the measure مَفْعَلَةٌ, as مَقْدَرَةٌ<br>\
and مَفْلَحَةٌ and مَنْجَاةٌ &amp;c., such as possesses<br>\
means of overcoming, or withstanding, invaders:<br>\
