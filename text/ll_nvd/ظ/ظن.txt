ظَنَّ, aor.<br>\
ظَنُ3َ, inf. n. ظَنٌّ, (Msb,) [He thought,<br>\
opined, supposed, or conjectured: and he doubted:<br>\
and he knew, but not by ocular perception: see<br>\
ظَنٌّ below:] you say, ظَنَنْتُ الشَّىْءَ, aor. أَظُنُّهُ,<br>\
inf. n. ظَنٌّ; and ↓ اِظَّنَنْتُهُ and اِظْطَنَنْتُهُ; and<br>\
↓ تَظَنَّنْتُهُ and تَظَنَّيْتُهُ, this last formed by changing<br>\
the last ن into ى: [i. e. I thought the thing,<br>\
&amp;c:] and Lh mentions, as heard from the<br>\
Benoo-Suleym, ظَنْتُ ذَاكَ i. e. ظَنَنْتُ ذاك [I<br>\
thought that, &amp;c.] like ظَلْتُ and other instances<br>\
of the dial. of Suleym. (M.) [In the first of<br>\
the senses expl. above, it governs two objective<br>\
complements, which are originally an inchoative<br>\
and an enunciative:] you say, ظَنَنْتُكَ زَيْدًا [I<br>\
thought thee Zeyd, originally I thought thou wast<br>\
Zeyd], and ظَنَنْتُ زَيْدًا إِيَّاكَ [I thought Zeyd<br>\
thee, originally I thought Zeyd was thou], denoting<br>\
by a pronoun what is originally an inchoative [in<br>\
the former phrase] and what is originally an<br>\
enunciative [in the latter phrase]. (S, TA.) It<br>\
is also used [in this sense] in the same manner as<br>\
a verb signifying an oath, the Arabs giving it<br>\
the same kind of complement, saying, ظَنَنْتُ لَعَبْدُ<br>\
اللّٰهِ خَيْرٌ مِنْكَ [I thought surely &#39;Abd-Allah was<br>\
better than thou]. (S in art. درد.) [ظَنَّ بِهِ كَذَا<br>\
means I thought of him, or it, such a thing: and<br>\
I thought such a thing to be in him, or it: and is<br>\
used in relation to good and to evil.] It is said<br>\
in the Kur [xxxiii. 10], وَتَطُنُّونَ بِاللّٰهِ الظُّنُونَا [And<br>\
ye were thinking, of God, various thoughts]. (M.)<br>\
Accord. to Sb, ظَنَنْتُ بِهِ means I made him, or<br>\
it, the place [i. e. object] of my ظَنّ [or thought,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (M.) [In all these exs. the verb denotes<br>\
a state of mind between doubt and certainty, but<br>\
the latter is predominant: and hence ظَنَّ sometimes means He doubted: and sometimes, he<br>\
knew, by considering with endeavour to understand, not by ocular perception; being more frequently used in this sense than as meaning “ he<br>\
doubted,” though not so frequently as it is in the<br>\
sense of “ he thought,” whence the meaning “ he<br>\
knew ” is held by some to be tropical.] إِنَّى,<br>\
ظَنَنْتُ أَنِّى مُلَاقٍ حِسَابِيَهْ, in the Kur [lxix. 20],<br>\
means Verily I knew [that I should meet with my<br>\
reckoning]. (T.) And الَّذِينَ يَظُنُّونَ أَنَّهُمْ مُلَاقُو<br>\
رَبِّهِمْ, in the same [ii. 43], means Who know<br>\
[that they shall meet their Lord, lit., be meeters of<br>\
their Lord]. (Msb.) And ظَنَنْتُ مَا قَالَ, occurring in a trad., means I knew [what he meant to<br>\
say by his making a sign with his hand]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  ظَنَنْتُهُ, (M, Mgh, Msb,) aor. as above, (Msb,)<br>\
and so the inf. n., (M,) signifies also I suspected<br>\
him; thought evil of him; (M, Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
and (M) so ↓ اِظَّنَنْتُهُ (S, M, Mgh, K) and<br>\
اِظْطَنَنْتُهُ (M, TA) and اِطَّنَنْتُهُ. (TA.) [Thus,<br>\
too, ↓ أَظْنَنْتُهُ accord. to several copies of the S<br>\
and accord. to the CK; but this is app. a mistranscription.] In the saying of Ibn-Seereen, لَمْ<br>\
فِى قَتْلِ عُثْمَانَ ↓ يَكُنْ عَلِىٌّ يُظَّنُّ, (T, S, K, but in<br>\
the T مَا كَان,) meaning Alee was not suspected<br>\
[in the case of the slaying of &#39;Othmán], (T,)<br>\
يُظَّنُّ is of the measure يُفْتَعَلُ, originally يُظْتَنُّ:<br>\
(T, S, K:) so says A&#39;Obeyd: (T:) or, as some<br>\
relate it, the word is يُطَّنُّ. (TA.) One says,<br>\
بِكَذَا ↓ هُوَ يُظَّنُّ and يُطَّنُّ, meaning He is suspected of such a thing. (TA in art. طن.) And<br>\
طَنَنْتُ بِزَيْدٍ and ظَنَنْتُ زَيْدًا I suspected Zeyd: in<br>\
this sense the verb has a single objective complement. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَظْنَنْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ I made him to think the thing.<br>\
(M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And أَظْنَنْتُ بِهِ النَّاسَ [I made the<br>\
people to suspect him: or] I exposed him to suspicion; (M, Msb, TA;) [and] so أَظنَنْتُهُ [alone].<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 1, last quarter.<br>\
5<br>\
التَّظَنِّى means The exercising, employing, or<br>\
using, of الظَّنّ [i. e. thought, &amp;c.]; originally<br>\
التَّظَنُّنُ. (S, K.) A&#39;Obeyd says, تَظَنَّيْتُ is from<br>\
ظَنَنْتُ, and is originally تَظَنَّنْتُ; the ن being<br>\
many, one of them is changed into ى: it is like<br>\
قَصَّيْتُ, which is originally قَصَّصْتُ. (T.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also 1, first sentence.<br>\
8<br>\
إِظْتَنَ3َ see 1, first sentence: ―<br>\
-b2-  and again, in the<br>\
last quarter, in three places.<br>\
ظَنٌّ is a simple subst. as well as an inf. n.;<br>\
(TA;) and signifies Thought, opinion, supposition, or conjecture: (Er-Rághib, Mgh, TA:)<br>\
or a preponderant belief, with the admission that<br>\
the contrary may be the case: (KT, El-Munáwee, TA:) or a preponderating wavering<br>\
between the two extremes in indecisive belief:<br>\
(K:) or an inference from a sign, or mark, or<br>\
token; when strong, leading to knowledge; and<br>\
when weak, not exceeding the limit of وَهْم: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or doubt or uncertainty; (T, M;)<br>\
or it has this meaning also; (Er-Rághib, TA;)<br>\
contr. of يَقِينٌ: (Msb:) and sometimes it is put<br>\
in the place, (S, K,) or used in the sense, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) of عِلْمٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) or يَقِينٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
[i. e. knowledge, or certainty,] in which sense it<br>\
is [held by some to be] tropical; (Mgh;) or it<br>\
signifies also knowledge, or certainty, (يَقِينٌ, T,<br>\
M,) such as is obtained by considering with endeavour to understand, not by ocular perception,<br>\
(M,) or not such as relates to an object of sense:<br>\
(MF:) and it also means suspicion, or evil<br>\
opinion: (Er-Rághib, TA: [but in this last sense,<br>\
ظِنَّةٌ is more common:]) as a subst., (TA,) its pl.<br>\
is ظُنُونٌ and أَظَانِينُ, (M, K, TA,) the latter<br>\
anomalous, or (as ISd says, TA) it may be pl.<br>\
of ↓ أُظْنُونَةٌ, but this I do not know. (M, TA.)<br>\
One says, هُوَ سَيِّئُ الظَّنِّ بِكُلِّ أَحَدٍ [He is evil in<br>\
opinion of everyone]. (M.) [And سَآءَ ظَنُّهُ بِفُلَانٍ<br>\
His opinion of such a one was evil.] And عِلْمُهُ<br>\
بِالشَّىْءِ ظُنُونٌ [His knowledge is but opinions];<br>\
meaning that no confidence is to be placed in him.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
ظِنَّةٌ Suspicion, or evil opinion; (T, S, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) as also طِنَّةٌ; the ظ being<br>\
changed into ط, though there is no إِدْغَام in this<br>\
case, because of their being accustomed to say<br>\
اِطَّنَّ [for اِظَّنَّ, which is for اِظْطَنَّ]; an instance<br>\
like الدِّكْرُ, which is made to accord with اِدَّكَرَ<br>\
[for اِذَّكَرَ, which is for اِذْدَكَرَ], as mentioned by<br>\
Sb; (M;) and ↓ ظَنَانَةٌ, (so accord. to a copy of<br>\
the M,) or ↓ ظِنَانَةٌ, like كِتَابَةٌ, (TA,) signifies<br>\
the same: (M, TA:) the pl. of ظِنَّةٌ is ظِنَنٌ.<br>\
(S, K.) One says, عِنْدَهُ ظِنَّتِى and هُوَ ظِنَّتِى,<br>\
meaning He is the place [i. e. object] of my<br>\
suspicion. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] (assumed tropical:)  A little [like<br>\
the French “ soupçon ”] of a thing. (TA.)<br>\
ظُنَنٌ: see ظَنَّانٌ.<br>\
ظَنُونٌ A man who thinks evil (S, M) of everyone. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A man possessing little good or<br>\
goodness: or, as some say, of whom one asks [a<br>\
thing] thinking that he will refuse, and who is as<br>\
he was thought to be: (M:) [or] ↓ ظَنِينٌ has this<br>\
latter meaning. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A man in whose goodness no trust, or confidence, is to be placed. (M.)<br>\
And Anything in which no trust, or confidence, is<br>\
to be placed, (M, TA,) of water, and of other<br>\
things; (TA;) as also ↓ ظَنِينٌ. (M, TA.) A<br>\
well (بِئْرٌ) having little water, (S, M, K,) in the<br>\
water of which no trust, or confidence, is to be<br>\
placed: (M:) or a well, (S, K,) or a drinkingplace, (M,) of which one knows not whether there<br>\
be in it water or not: (S, M, K:) or water<br>\
which one imagines, or supposes, to exist, but of<br>\
which one is not sure. (TA.) كُلُّ مَنِيَّةٍ ظَنُونٌ<br>\
إِلَّا القَتْلَ فِى سَبِيلِ اللّٰهِ is a saying mentioned, but<br>\
not expl., by IAar; [app. meaning Every death<br>\
is doubtful as to its consequence except slaughter<br>\
in the way, or cause, of God; but ISd says,] in<br>\
my opinion the meaning is that it is of little good<br>\
and profit. (M.) دَيْنٌ ظَنُونٌ means A debt of<br>\
which one knows not whether he who owes it will<br>\
pay it or not: (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, * K:) it is<br>\
said in a trad. of &#39;Omar that there is no poorrate in the case of such a debt. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also<br>\
A man suspected in relation to his intellect, or intelligence. (Aboo-Tálib, TA.) And A woman<br>\
suspected in relation to her grounds of pretension<br>\
to respect, or honour, on account of lineage &amp;c.<br>\
(TA.) And A woman of noble rank or quality,<br>\
who is taken in marriage, (M, K,) from a desire<br>\
of obtaining off spring by her, when she is advanced<br>\
in age. (M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also A weak man. (K. [See<br>\
also ظَنينٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b6-  And A man having little artifice,<br>\
cunning, ingenuity, or skill. (K.)<br>\
ظَنِينٌ Suspected; (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
applied to a man; (S, M;) i. q. ↓ مَظْنُونٌ,<br>\
(Mbr, Msb,) in this sense: (Msb:) pl. أَظِنَّآءُ.<br>\
(M, TA.) Thus in the saying in the Kur [lxxxi.<br>\
24], وَمَا هُوَ عَلَى الْغَيْبِ بِظَنِينٍ, (T, M, Msb,)<br>\
meaning And he is not suspected as to what he<br>\
makes known from God, of the knowledge of<br>\
that which is undiscoverable, as is related on the<br>\
authority of &#39;Alee: or, accord. to Fr, it may mean<br>\
weak; for ظَنِينٌ may have this meaning like as<br>\
ظَنُونٌ has: (T:) some read بِضَنينٍ. (TA in art.<br>\
ضن, q. v.) شَهَادَةُ ظَنِينٍ, which is said in a trad.<br>\
to be not allowable, is The testimony of one who<br>\
is suspected as to his religion. (TA.) And نَفْسٌ<br>\
↓ ظَنَّآءُ means [A soul, or person,] suspected.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also One who treats or regards<br>\
another, or others, with enmity, or hostility; (T,<br>\
M;) because of his evil opinion and the evil<br>\
opinion of which he is an object. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See<br>\
also ظَنُونٌ, in two places.<br>\
ظَنَانَةٌ or ظِنَانَةٌ: see ظِنَّةٌ.<br>\
ظَنَّآءُ: see ظَنِينٌ.<br>\
ظَنَّانٌ One who opines, or conjectures, much<br>\
[and] in an evil manner; as also ↓ ظُنَنٌ. (TA.)<br>\
أَظَنُّ [Such as is more, or most, fit that one<br>\
should think of him to do a thing]. You say,<br>\
نَظَرْتُ إِلَى أَظَنِّهِمْ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ ذٰلِكَ I looked towards<br>\
him who was the most fit of them that I should<br>\
think of him to do that. (M, TA.)<br>\
أُظْنُونَةٌ: see ظَنٌّ, near the end.<br>\
مَظِنَّةٌ, (M, Mgh, Msb, TA,) of which مَظَنَّةٌ,<br>\
mentioned by Ibn-Málik and others, and مِظَنَّةٌ,<br>\
are dial. vars., (TA,) or [rather] مَظِنَّةُ شَىْءٍ,<br>\
(IF, S, Msb, K, TA,) signifies The place, (IF,<br>\
S, Msb, K, TA,) and the accustomed place, (IF,<br>\
S, Msb, TA,) in which is thought to be the<br>\
existence, (S, K, TA,) of a thing; (IF, S, Msb,<br>\
K, TA;) [a place] where a thing is thought to<br>\
be: (M:) or it signifies, (Mgh, Msb,) or signifies also, (S,) a place where a thing is known to<br>\
be: (S, Mgh, Msb:) [a thing, and a person, in<br>\
which, or in whom, a thing, or quality, is thought,<br>\
supposed, presumed, suspected, inferred, known,<br>\
or accustomed, to be, or exist:] accord. to IAth,<br>\
by rule it should be مَظَنَّةٌ: (TA:) [it may therefore be properly rendered a cause of thinking,<br>\
&amp;c., the existence of a thing; and مَظِنَّةٌ لِكَذَا may<br>\
be well expl. as meaning a thing, and a person,<br>\
that occasions one&#39;s thinking, supposing, presuming<br>\
suspecting, inferring, or knowing, the existence of<br>\
such a thing or quality, in it, or in him: and<br>\
hence, an indication, or evidence, or a symptom,<br>\
diagnostic, characteristic, sign, mark, or token, of<br>\
the existence of such a thing or quality:] the pl.<br>\
is مَظَانُّ. (M, Mgh, Msb, TA.) One says, مَوْضِعُ<br>\
كَذَا مَظِنَّةٌ مِنْ فُلَانٍ i. e. Such a place is a place<br>\
in which such a one is known [&amp;c.] to be. (S,<br>\
TA.) And فُلَانٌ مَظِنَّةٌ مِنْ كَذَا i. e. Such a one<br>\
is one in whom such a thing, or quality, is known<br>\
[&amp;c.] to be. (Lh, T.) And فُلَانٌ مَظِنَّةٌ لِلْخَيْرِ<br>\
i. e. Such a one is one in whom good, or goodness,<br>\
is thought [&amp;c.] to be. (Ham p. 437.) And En-Nábighah says,<br>\
فَإِنْ يَكُ عَامِرٌ قَدْ قَالَ جَهْلًا<br>\
فَإِنَّ مَظِنَّةَ الجَهْلِ الشَّبَابُ<br>\
[And if &#39;Ámir has spoken ignorantly, verily<br>\
youthfulness is a state in which ignorance is<br>\
usually found to exist]: (S, Msb: *) or, as some<br>\
relate the verse, السِّبَابُ [so that the meaning is,<br>\
mutual reviling is an act in which &amp;c.]: (S:)<br>\
or, accord. to another relation, the latter hemistich is<br>\
فَإِنَّ مَطِيَّةَ الجَهْلِ الشَّبَابُ<br>\
(S, * TA;) because one finds it [i. e. youthfulness] to be easy like as he does the beast on<br>\
which one rides. (TA.) And one says also,<br>\
طَلَبَهُ مَظَانَّهُ [He sought him, or it, in the places<br>\
where he, or it, was thought to be;] meaning, by<br>\
night and by day. (TA.) And إِنَّهُ لَمَظِنَّةٌ أَنْ<br>\
يَفْعَلَ ذٰلِكَ i. e. Verily he is apt, meet, fitted, or<br>\
suited, for one to think of his doing that: and in<br>\
like manner one says of two, and of a pl. number,<br>\
and of a female. (Lh, M.)<br>\
مَظْنُونٌ [Thought, opined, &amp;c.: see its verb:<br>\
and] see ظَنِينٌ. Applied to a narrative, or story,<br>\
it means [Doubted; or] of which one is not to be<br>\
made to know the real state. (TA in art. رجم.)<br>\
