ظَمِىَ, [and ظَمِيَتْ, aor.<br>\
ظَمَىَ,] inf. n. ظَمًى, He,<br>\
or it, [and she, or it,] had any of the qualities denoted by the epithet أَظْمَى [and its fem. ظَمْيَآءُ].<br>\
(M, TA. [See أَظْمَى, and see also ظَمًى expl.<br>\
below.])<br>\
2<br>\
ظَمَّىَ see the next paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
أُظْمِىَ, inf. n. إِظْمَآءٌ, He (a horse) was made<br>\
lean, or lank; as also ↓ ظُمِّىَ, inf. n. تَظْمِيَةٌ. (T,<br>\
TA. [See also 4 in art. ظمأ.])<br>\
ظَمًى is the inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]: and [it is said<br>\
that it] signifies The withering, or drying up, of<br>\
the lip, from thirst: (M:) so says Lth: but it<br>\
signifies paucity of the flesh and blood of the lip;<br>\
not the withering, or drying-up, in consequence of<br>\
thirst: it is a quality that is commended: (T:)<br>\
or a tawny, or brownish, or dusky, colour, and a<br>\
withering, or drying-up, in the lip. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
Paucity of the blood of the gum: (Lth, T:) or<br>\
paucity of the blood and flesh of the gum. (M.)<br>\
[In the T is added ويعتريه الحُسْنُ: and in the<br>\
M, وهو يعترى الحُبْسَ, in which الحُبْسَ seems to<br>\
be evidently a mistranscription for الحُبْشَ: I<br>\
therefore think it most probable that in the T,<br>\
as well as in the M, the right reading is وَهُوَ<br>\
يَعْتَرِى الحُبْشَ, meaning and it is incidental to<br>\
the Abyssinians.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And Tawniness of a spearshaft. (T.)<br>\

أَظْمَى Anything withering, or withered; or<br>\
becoming, or become, dried up; from heat; as<br>\
also ↓ ظَمٍ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] شَفَةٌ ظَمْيَآءُ A lip<br>\
that is not swollen, [not] having much blood;<br>\
(T;) accord. to Lth, from thirst; but AZ says<br>\
that it is not so: (TA: [see ظَمًى:]) or a lip in<br>\
which is a tawny, or brownish, or dusky, colour,<br>\
and a withering, or lack of moisture: (S:) or a<br>\
lip withering, or withered, or lacking moisture,<br>\
inclining to a tawny, or brownish, or dusky,<br>\
colour. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And لِثَةٌ ظَمْيَآءُ A gum having<br>\
little blood: (S, K:) or, accord. to the M, having<br>\

(T in art. روى.) ―<br>\
-b6-  أَظْمَى is also applied to a<br>\
man, as signifying Black in the lip: (M:) and<br>\
so ظَمْيَآءُ applied to a woman. (T, M.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And<br>\
the former applied to a man, and the latter to a<br>\
woman, Having the quality of the gum termed<br>\
ظَمًى expl. above. (M.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Both also, accord.<br>\
to Lh, signify Tawny, brownish, or dusky; the<br>\
former as applied to a man, and the latter to a<br>\
woman: (M:) and thus the former applied to a<br>\
spear, (As, T, S, M,) and the latter to a spearshaft (قَنَاة). (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And أَظْمَى signifies also<br>\
Black: (T:) thus as applied to shade: (S:) and<br>\
so the fem. applied to a she-camel: (K:) or the<br>\
latter applied to a she-camel, and [the pl.] ظُمْىٌ<br>\
