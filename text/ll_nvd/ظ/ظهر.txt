ظَهَرَ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
ظَهَرَ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
ظُهُورٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) [It was, or became, outward, exterior, external, extrinsic, or<br>\
exoteric: and hence,] it appeared; became apparent, overt, open, perceptible or perceived,<br>\
manifest, plain, or evident; (S, Mgh, Msb, K,<br>\
TA;) after having been concealed, or latent:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) and ↓ تظاهر signifies the same.<br>\
(Har p. 85.) Hence the phrase ظَهَرَ لِى رَأْىٌ (assumed tropical:)  [An<br>\
idea, or opinion, occurred to me], said when one<br>\
knows what he did not know before. (Msb.)<br>\
[And هٰذَا مَا يَظْهَرُ لِى (assumed tropical:)  This is what appears to<br>\
me to be the case, or to be the right way or<br>\
course; or this is my opinion.] ظَهَرَ الحَمْلُ,<br>\
inf. n. as above, means Pregnancy became apparent, or manifest: it is said that this is not the<br>\
case in less than three months. (Msb.) And<br>\
it is said in a trad. of &#39;Áïsheh, كَانَ يُصَلِّى العَصْرَ<br>\
فِى حُجْرَتِى قَبْلَ أَنْ تَظْهَرَ i. e. [He used to perform the prayer of the afternoon in my chamber]<br>\
before it (meaning the sun) became high and apparent: (TA:) or وَالشَّمْسُ فِى حُجْرَتِى لَمْ تَظْهَرْ<br>\
بَعْدُ i. e. [when the sun was in my chamber,] it not<br>\
having risen high so as to be on the flat roof<br>\
[thereof]: referring to the Prophet. (O. [But العَصْرَ<br>\
must be a mistranscription for الفَجْرَ, i. e. the<br>\
prayer of the dawn.]) The saying in the Kur<br>\
[xxiv. 31], وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا [which<br>\
is app. best rendered And that they discover not<br>\
their ornature except what is external thereof] has<br>\
been expl. in seven different ways, most correctly<br>\
as meaning the clothes: (O, TA:) accord. to<br>\
&#39;Áïsheh, it means the bracelet (القُلْب) and the<br>\
ring (الفَتَخَة): and accord. to I&#39;Ab, the hand and<br>\
the signet-ring and the face. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
He went forth, or out, (Mgh, TA,) to the outside<br>\
of a place. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He (a bird)<br>\
migrated, or went down, from one country or<br>\
region to another: used in this sense by AHn in<br>\
relation to the vulture, migrating to Nejd. (L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  ظَهَرَ عَنْهُ, said of a vice, or fault, (O, TA,) or<br>\
a disgrace, (JK, A, O,) (tropical:)  It did not cleave to<br>\
him; (A, O, TA;) it was remote from him;<br>\
(TA;) it quitted him, or departed from him.<br>\
(JK.) ―<br>\
-b5-  ظَهَرْتُ بِهِ, (O, TA,) inf. n. ظَهْرٌ, (K,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I gloried, or boasted, by reason of it. (O, K *<br>\
TA.) [Respecting a meaning assigned to ظَهَرَ<br>\
بِفُلَانٍ in the K, see 4.] ―<br>\
-b6-  أَكَلَ الرَّجُلُ أُكْلَةً<br>\
ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا ظَهْرَةً means (assumed tropical:)  [The man ate some food]<br>\
in consequence of which] he became fat. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  ظَهَرَهُ He mounted it; went, or got, upon it,<br>\
or upon the top of it; (S, A, * Mgh, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
as also ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ; (O;) namely, a house, (S,)<br>\
or a house-top, (A, Mgh, O,) and a mountain,<br>\
(A,) and a wall; (O, Msb;) properly, he became<br>\
upon its back: (Mgh:) and [in like manner] one<br>\
says, فُلَانٌ نَجْدًا ↓ ظَهَّرَ, inf. n. تَظْهِيرٌ, Such a one<br>\
mounted, or went up, upon the high region (ظَهْر)<br>\
of Nejd. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (Mgh, Msb,) ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and بِهِ, (K,) inf. n. ظُهُورٌ<br>\
(Bd in xxiv. 31) and ظَهْرٌ also, (Ham p. 301,)<br>\
He overcame, conquered, subdued, overpowered, or<br>\
mastered, him; gained the mastery or victory, or<br>\
prevailed, over him; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
namely, his enemy; (Msb;) and in like manner,<br>\
[he conquered, won, achieved, or attained, it, i. e.]<br>\
a thing. (O, TA.) [The saying فُلَانٌ لَا يَظْهَرُ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ أَحَدٌ is expl. in the L and TA by the words<br>\
اى لا يَسْلَم, and said to be tropical: but Ibr D<br>\
thinks that the correct reading is لا يُسَلِّمُ, from<br>\
التَّسْلِيمُ; and that it is said of one who will not<br>\
give up, or resign, what is in his hand; so that<br>\
the meaning is, (tropical:)  Such a one is a person whom no<br>\
one will overcome in respect of that which he holds<br>\
in his possession.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence also] ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) inf. n. ظُهُورٌ, (TA,) He knew, became<br>\
acquainted with, or got knowledge of, him, or<br>\
it. (Msb, TA.) So in the Kur xxiv. 31, وَالطِّفْلُ<br>\
الَّذِينَ لَمْ يَظْهَرُوا عَلَى عَوْرَاتِ النِّسَآءِ [And the young<br>\
children] who have not attained knowledge of the<br>\
عورات, (Bd, Jel,) meaning [pudenda, or] parts<br>\
between the navel and the knee, (Jel,) of women,<br>\
by reason of their want of discrimination: (Bd:)<br>\
or (tropical:)  who have not attained to the generative<br>\
faculty; (O, Bd, * TA;) from الظُّهُورُ in the sense<br>\
of الغَلَبَةُ. (Bd.) So too in the Kur [xviii. 19],<br>\
إِنْ يَظْهَرُوا عَلَيْكُمْ If they get knowledge of you.<br>\
(O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And [hence] ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ, (Fr, A, O,<br>\
TA,) and ↓ استظهرهُ, (S, A, O, K,) (tropical:)  He knew it,<br>\
or learned it, by heart; namely, the Kur-án;<br>\
(A, O, TA;) and he recited it by heart: (A, *<br>\
TA; and so in the S and O in explanation of the<br>\
latter:) or [simply] he recited it by heart; namely,<br>\
the Kur-án; as also ↓ اظهرهُ: (O, K, TA:) in<br>\
the copies of the K we find أَظْهَرْتُ عَلَى القُرْآنِ and<br>\
أَظْهَرْتُهُ; but the former is a mistake for ظَهَرْتُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
ظَهَرَ. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  For another signification of<br>\
ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ, see 3.<br>\
-A4-  ظَهَرَ بِحَاجَتِى, (S, A, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
ظَهَرَ, (TA,) inf. n. ظَهْرٌ; (TK;) and ↓ ظهّرها,<br>\
(K, TA,) in some copies of the K ظَهَرَهَا; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ اظهرها, (K,) inf. n. إِظْهَارٌ; (TA;) and<br>\
↓ اِظَّهَرَهَا, (K,) of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ; (TA;)<br>\
(tropical:)  He held the object of my want in little, or light,<br>\
estimation, or in contempt; (S, A;) [lit.] he put<br>\
it behind [his] back; (S, K;) as though he put it<br>\
away, [out of his sight,] and paid no regard to it.<br>\
(S, TA.) One says also, يَظْهَرُونَ بِهِمْ وَلَا يَلْتَفِتُونَ<br>\
إِلَى أَرْحَامِهِمْ [They hold them in contempt, and<br>\
do not pay any regard to their ties of relationship]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 10, in three places.<br>\
-A5-<br>\
ظَهَرَهُ, (O, K,) aor.<br>\
ظَهَرَ, inf. n. ظَهْرٌ, (K,) He struck,<br>\
or smote, (TA,) or hit, or hurt, (O, K,) his back.<br>\
(O, K, TA.)<br>\
-A6-  ظَهِرَ, (S, O, K,) aor.<br>\
ظَهَرَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. ظَهَرٌ, (O, K,) He (a man, S, O) had a<br>\
complaint of his back. (S, O, K.)<br>\
-A7-  ظَهُرَ, (JK,<br>\
O, L,) or ظَهَرَ, (K, [but this is app. a mistranscription,]) inf. n. ظَهَارَةٌ, (S, O, L, K,) said of a<br>\
camel, (JK, S, O,) He was, or became, strong<br>\
(JK, S, O, L, K) in the back. (L, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
ظَهَّرَ see 1, near the middle: ―<br>\
-b2-  and again, in<br>\
the last quarter: ―<br>\
-b3-  and see also 3. ―<br>\
-b4-  ظهّر الثَّوْبَ<br>\
[and ↓ اظهرهُ, contr. of بطّنهُ and ابطنهُ,] He faced<br>\
the garment, or piece of cloth; put a facing, or<br>\
an outer covering, (ظِهَارَة,) to it. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also 4, last sentence.<br>\
3<br>\
ظاهرهُ, (A,) inf. n. مُظَاهَرَةٌ, (S, O, Msb,) He<br>\
aided, or assisted, him; (S, A, O, Msb;) as also<br>\
عَلَيْهِ ↓ ظَهَرَ. (Th, K.) And ظاهر عَلَيْهِ He aided,<br>\
or assisted, against him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ظاهر بِهِ: see<br>\
10. ―<br>\
-b3-  ظاهر بَيْنَهُمَا, (K,) i. e. (TA) بَيْنَ ثَوْبَيْنِ,<br>\
(S, A, Mgh, TA,) and دِرْعَيْنِ, (A, Mgh, TA,)<br>\
and نَعْلَيْنِ, (TA,) i. q. طَارَقَ بَيْنَهُمَا, (S, TA,) or<br>\
طَابَقَ, (A, K, TA,) i. e. (TA) He put them on,<br>\
or attired himself with them, [namely, two garments, and two coats of mail, and two sandals<br>\
or soles, or rather, when relating to two soles,<br>\
he sewed them together,] one over, or outside, the<br>\
other: (Mgh, TA:) app. from تَظَاهُرٌ in the sense<br>\
of “ mutual aiding or assisting. ” (IAth.) The<br>\
phrase ظاهر بِدِرْعَيْنِ requires consideration; and<br>\
the ب in it should be regarded as meant to denote<br>\
conjunction; not as a part of the necessary complement of the verb. (Mgh.) ظاهر الدِّرْعَ is said<br>\
to signify لَأَمَ بَعْضَهَا عَلَى بَعْضٍ [app. meaning<br>\
He folded over and fastened one part of the coat<br>\
of mail upon another]. (TA.) And ظاهر عَلَيْهِ<br>\
جِلَالًا means He threw upon him (i. e. a horse)<br>\
housings or coverings [one over another]. (TA<br>\
in art. حنذ.)<br>\
-A2-  ظاهر مِنِ امْرَأَتِهِ, (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) inf. n. ظِهَارٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and<br>\
مُظَاهَرَةٌ; (JK, TA;) and مِنْهَا ↓ تظاهر, (A, Mgh,<br>\
O, TA,) and ↓ اِظَّاهَرَ; (Mgh;) and منها ↓ تظهّر,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) and ↓ اِظَّهَّرَ; (O, TA;) and منها ↓ ظهّر,<br>\
(S, O, K,) inf. n. تَظْهِيرٌ; (S;) signify the same;<br>\
(O;) He said to his wife أَنْتِ عَلَىَّ كَظَهْرِ أُمِّى<br>\
[Thou art to me like the back of my mother];<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K;) [as though he said رُكُوبُكِ<br>\
حَرَامٌ عَلَىَّ;] meaning رُكُوبُكِ لِلنِّكَاحِ حَرَامٌ عَلَىَّ<br>\
كَرُكُوبِ أُمِّى لِلنِّكَاحِ; the back being specified<br>\
in preference to the بَطْن or فَخِذ or فَرْج because<br>\
the woman is likened to a beast that is ridden,<br>\
and the act of نِكَاح to that of رُكُوب: the phrase<br>\
being a form of divorce used by the Arabs in the<br>\
Time of Ignorance. (Msb, * TA.) In the Kur<br>\
lviii. 2 [and 4], some read ↓ يَظَّهَّرُونَ; some<br>\
↓ يَظَّاهَرُونَ; and &#39;Ásim read يُظَاهِرُونَ. (Bd.)<br>\
The verb is made trans. by means of مِن because<br>\
the man who uttered this sentence estranged himself from his wife. (IAth.)<br>\
4<br>\
اظهرهُ He made it apparent, overt, open,<br>\
perceptible or perceived, manifest, plain, or evident;<br>\
he showed, exhibited, manifested, displayed, discovered, revealed, or evinced, it; or put it forth:<br>\
(S, O, K:) [it is also used in relation to a saying,<br>\
and an action, and the like, as meaning it showed,<br>\
&amp;c., as above, or it bespoke, it:] and Mtr relates<br>\
his having heard from one worthy of reliance of<br>\
the people of Baghdád, that they say ↓ تظاهرتُ<br>\
بِهِ in the place of أَظْهَرْتُهُ, and scarcely ever employ اظهر in its usual sense. (Har p. 85.)<br>\
[Hence, اظهر التَّضْعِيفَ He made the doubling of<br>\
a letter distinct; as in لَحِحَتْ; which, accord.<br>\
to a general rule, should be لَحَّتْ: opposed to<br>\
أَدْغَمَ. And اظهر لَهُ كَذَا He showed, &amp;c., to him<br>\
such a thing: and he made a show of, professed,<br>\
pretended, or feigned, to him such a thing: as, for<br>\
instance, love.] ―<br>\
-b2-  أَظْهَرْتُ بِفُلَانٍ means أَعْلَيْتُ بِهِ<br>\
[a phrase which I have not found except in this<br>\
instance, app. I elevated, or exalted, such a one:<br>\
like أَعْلَيْتُهُ, which has this meaning]: (S, IKtt,<br>\
L, TA:) or أَعْلَنْتُ بِهِ [app. meaning I made<br>\
such a one to be, or become, publicly known]: (So<br>\
in the O:) [but the former explanation seems to<br>\
be regarded by SM as the right; for he remarks<br>\
that,] accord. to all the copies of the K, the explanation is أَعْلَنَ بِهِ, and refers to ظَهَرَ بِفُلَانٍ<br>\
[instead of أَظْهَرَ]; so that what its author says<br>\
in this case differs in two points of view from<br>\
what is found in the “ Kitáb el-Abniyeh ” of<br>\
IKtt, in which the ى in أَعْلَيْتُ has been marked<br>\
as correct, and in the L [as well as in the S].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اظهرهُ اللّٰهُ عَلَى عَدُوِّهِ means God made<br>\
him to overcome, conquer, subdue, overpower,<br>\
master, gain the victory over, or prevail over, his<br>\
enemy. (S, A, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] اظهرهُ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ He (God) made him to know it, or become<br>\
acquainted with it: you say, أَظْهَرَنِى اللّٰهُ عَلَى مَا<br>\
سُرِقَ مِنِّى God made me to know [or discover]<br>\
what had been stolen from me. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See<br>\
also 1, last quarter, in two places.<br>\
-A4-  And see 2.<br>\
-A5-  اظهر signifies also He entered upon the time<br>\
called the ظَهِيرَة: (A, Msb, K:) or the time called<br>\
the ظُهْر. (Msb.) And He went, or journeyed,<br>\
in the time called the ظَهِيرَة; as also ↓ ظهّر, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. تَظْهِيرٌ: (TA:) or the time called the ظُهْر.<br>\
(S, O.)<br>\
5<br>\
تظهّر and<br>\
اِظَّهَّرَ: see 3, latter half, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
6<br>\
تَظَاْهَرَ see 1, first sentence: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also 4, first<br>\
sentence. ―<br>\
-b3-  تظاهروا They aided, or assisted, one<br>\
another. (S, O, * K.) And تظاهروا عَلَى فُلَانٍ<br>\
They leagued together, and aided one another,<br>\
against such a one. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA in art.<br>\
ضفر.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also They regarded, or treated, one<br>\
another with enmity, or hostility; or severed<br>\
themselves, one from another: (S, Msb, K:) as<br>\
though they turned their backs, one upon another:<br>\
(S:) or, because they who do so turn their backs,<br>\
one upon another. (Msb.) Thus the verb has<br>\
two contr. meanings. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  تظاهر مِنِ امْرَأَتِهِ<br>\
and اِظَّاهَرَ: see 3, latter half, in three places.<br>\
8<br>\
اِظَّهَرَ: see 1, last quarter.<br>\
10<br>\
استظهر بِهِ He sought aid, or assistance, in,<br>\
or by means of, him, or it, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
عَلَيْهِ [against him, or it]; as also استظهرهُ. (TA.)<br>\
[In the CK, after the explanation of استظهر به,<br>\
is an omission, to be supplied by the insertion of<br>\
وَقَرَأَهُ.] One says, استظهر بِالْغِنَى عَلَى النَّوَائِبِ<br>\
[He sought aid in wealth against calamities, or<br>\
afflictions]. (Msb.) And بِهِ ↓ ظاهر signifies the<br>\
same as استظهر [in this sense or in another of the<br>\
senses expl. in what follows]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
استظهرتُ بِالشَّىْءِ, and بِهِ ↓ ظَهَرْتُ, and ↓ ظَهَرْتُهُ,<br>\
I put the thing behind my back for protection, or<br>\
security. (Har p. 265.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And استظهر He prepared for himself a camel, or two camels, or<br>\
more, for future need: (T:) and استظهرهُ, and<br>\
بِهِ ↓ ظَهَرَ, He prepared him, namely, a camel,<br>\
for future need: (K:) and استظهر بِبَعِيرَيْنِ<br>\
ظِهْرِيَّيْنِ He prepared for himself two camels for<br>\
future need. (T. [See ظِهْرِىٌّ.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  Hence, (T,)<br>\
استظهر signifies also He used precaution (T,<br>\
Msb) with respect to anything: (T:) he secured<br>\
himself, (اِسْتَوْثَقَ,) by using precaution; as, for<br>\
instance, a woman does by remaining three days,<br>\
before she performs the ablution termed غُسْل,<br>\
and prays, after the usual period of the menses.<br>\
(T, L.) One says, يُسْتَحَبُّ الاِسْتِظْهَارُ بِغَسْلَةٍ ثَانِيَةٍ<br>\
وَثَالِثَةٍ The using precaution by a second and a<br>\
third washing, to make sure of being pure, is<br>\
approved. (Er-Ráfi&#39;ee, Msb.) And استظهرتُ<br>\
فِى طَلَبِ الشَّىْءِ I adopted the most fit, or proper,<br>\
way, and used precaution, in seeking to attain<br>\
the thing. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also 1, in the middle<br>\
of the latter half.<br>\
ظَهْرٌ The back; contr. of بَطْنٌ: (S, A, O, Msb,<br>\
K:) in a man, from the hinder part of the كَاهِل<br>\
[or base of the neck] to the nearest part of the<br>\
buttocks, where it terminates: (TA:) in a camel,<br>\
the part containing six vertebræ on the right and<br>\
left of which are [two portions of flesh and sinew<br>\
called the] مَتْنَانِ: (AHeyth, T, O:) of the masc.<br>\
gender: (Lh, A, K:) pl. [of pauc.] أَظْهُرٌ, and [of<br>\
mult.] ظُهُورٌ and ظُهْرَانٌ. (Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَجُلٌ<br>\
خَفِيفُ الظَّهْرِ (tropical:)  A man having a small household to<br>\
maintain: and ثَقِيلُ الظَّهْرِ (tropical:)  having a large household to maintain. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَنْت عَلَىَّ كَظَهْرِ<br>\
أُمِّى Thou art to me like the back of my mother:<br>\
said by a man to his wife. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.)<br>\
[This has been expl. above: see 3.] ―<br>\
-b4-  عَدَا فِى<br>\
ظَهْرِهِ (tropical:)  He stole what was behind him: (A:) [or<br>\
he acted wrongfully in respect of what was behind<br>\
him: for] لِصٌّ عَادِى ظَهْرٍ is expl. by the words<br>\
عَدَا فِى ظَهْرٍ فَسَرَقَهُ [so that it app. means (tropical:)  A<br>\
thief who has acted wrongfully in respect of<br>\
what was behind one, and stolen it]. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
أَقْرَانُ الظَّهْرِ (S, O, K) and الظُّهُورِ (O, TA)<br>\
Adversaries who come to one from behind his<br>\
back, in war, or fight. (S, O, K, * TA.) In the<br>\
copies of the K, يُحِبُّونَكَ is erroneously put for<br>\
يَجِيؤُونَكَ. (TA.) You say also, فُلَانٌ قِرْنُ الظَّهْرِ<br>\
Such a one is an adversary who comes to one<br>\
from behind, unknown. (IAar, As.) ―<br>\
-b6-  قَتَلَهُ ظَهْرًا<br>\
He slew him unexpectedly; he assassinated him;<br>\
syn. غِيلَةٌ. (IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  جَعَلَنِى بِظَهْرٍ (tropical:)  He<br>\
cast me off. (TA.) And جَعَلتُ حَاجَتَهُ بِظَهْرٍ<br>\
(tropical:)  I cast his want behind my back: (AO, K:)<br>\
and ↓ جَعَلَهَا ظِهْرِيَّةً signifies the same: (S:) and<br>\
↓ اِتَّخَذَهَا ظِهْرِيًّا, (K,) and ↓ ظِهْرِيَّةً: (TA:) or<br>\
the former of the last two phrases signifies he<br>\
held it in contempt; as though ظهريّا were an<br>\
irreg. rel. n. from ظَهْرٌ: (TA:) or ↓ اِتَّخَذَهُ ظِهْرِيًّا<br>\
signifies he neglected, or forgot, (S, O, * Msb,)<br>\
him, as in the Kur xi. 94, (S, O,) or it, namely,<br>\
what was said. (Msb.) And لَا تَجْعَلْ حَاجَتِى<br>\
بِظَهْرٍ (tropical:)  Forget not thou, or neglect not, my want:<br>\
(S:) and ↓ جَعَلَهُ ظِهْرِيًّا signifies he forgot it; as<br>\
well as جعله بِظَهْرٍ. (A.) And جَعَلْتُ هٰذَا الأَمْرَ<br>\
بِظَهْرٍ, and رَمَيْتُهُ بِظَهْرٍ, (tropical:)  I cared not for this thing.<br>\
(Th, O.) ―<br>\
-b8-  فُلَانٌ مِنْ وَلَدِ الظَّهْرِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is<br>\
of those who do not belong to us: or of those to<br>\
whom no regard is paid: (TA:) or of those who<br>\
are held in contempt, and to whose ties of<br>\
relationship no regard is paid. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
هُوَ ابْنُ عَمِّهِ ظَهْرًا (tropical:)  [He is his cousin on the<br>\
father&#39;s side,] distantly related: contr. of دِنْيًا<br>\
[and لَحًّا]. (As, A, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  رَجَعَ عَلَى ظَهْرِهِ<br>\
[He receded, retired, or retreated]. (K in art.<br>\
ثبجر.) ―<br>\
-b11-  هُوَ نَازِلٌ بَيْنَ ظَهْرَيْهِمْ, and ↓ بين ظَهْرَانَيْهِمْ,<br>\
(S, A, O, Msb, K, *) in which latter the ا and ن<br>\
are said by some to be added for corroboration,<br>\
(Msb,) and for which one should not say<br>\
ظَهْرَانِيهِمْ, (IF, S, O, Msb, K,) and بين أَظْهُرِهِمْ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) (tropical:)  He is making his abode in the<br>\
midst of them; in the main body of them: (K,<br>\
TA:) originally meaning he is making his abode<br>\
among them for the purpose of seeking aid of<br>\
them and staying himself upon them: as though<br>\
it meant that the back of one of them was before<br>\
him, and that of another behind him, so that he<br>\
was defended in either direction: afterwards, by<br>\
reason of frequency of usage, it came to be<br>\
employed to signify abiding among a people<br>\
absolutely. (IAth, Msb.) You say also هُوَ بَيْنَ<br>\
ظَهْرَيْهِ, and ↓ بَيْنَ ظَهْرَانَيْهِ, meaning It (anything)<br>\
is in the midst, or main part, of it, namely,<br>\
another thing. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-  لَقِيتُهُ بَيْنَ الظَّهْرَيْنِ, and<br>\
↓ بَيْنَ الظَّهْرَانَيْنِ, (S, O, Msb, K,) (tropical:)  I met him<br>\
during the day, (Msb,) or during the two days,<br>\
(S, O, K,) or during the three days, (K,) or the<br>\
days: (S, O, Msb:) from the next preceding<br>\
phrase. (TA.) And أَتَيْتُهُ مَرَّةً بَيْنَ الظَّهَرْينِ (tropical:)  I<br>\
came to him one day: or, accord. to Aboo-Fak&#39;as, on a day between two years. (Fr.)<br>\
And اللَّيْلِ ↓ رَأَيْتُهُ بَيْنَ ظَهْرَانَىِ (tropical:)  I saw him between nightfall and daybreak. (TA.) And<br>\
النَّهَارِ ↓ جِئْتُهُ بَيْنَ ظَهْرَانَىِ (tropical:)  [I came to him between the beginning and end of the day]. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b13-  تَقَلَّبَ ظَهْرًا لِبَطْنٍ (assumed tropical:)  It turned over and over,<br>\
or upside down, (lit. back for belly,) as a serpent<br>\
does upon ground heated by the sun. (S and TA<br>\
in art. قلب.) [Hence,] قَلَبْتُ الأَرْضَ ظَهْرًا لِبَطْنٍ<br>\
(tropical:)  [I turned the earth over, upside-down]. (A.)<br>\
And [hence,] قَلَّبَ أَمْرَهُ ظَهْرًا لِبَطْنٍ, (O, * TA,)<br>\
and ظَهْرَهُ لِبَطْنٍ, and ظَهْرَهُ لِبَطْنِهِ, and ظَهْرَهُ لِلْبَطْنِ,<br>\
which last form is preferred by El-Farezdak to<br>\
the second, because [as in the third form] the<br>\
second of the two words is determinate like the<br>\
first word, (tropical:)  He meditated, or managed, the<br>\
affair with forecast, and well. (O, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b14-  The<br>\
Arabs used to say, هٰذَا ظَهْرُ السَّمَآءِ and هذا بَطْنُ<br>\
السَّمَآءِ, both meaning (tropical:)  This is the apparent,<br>\
visible, part of the sky. (Fr, Az.) And the like<br>\
is said of the side of a wall, which is its بَطْن to<br>\
a person on the same side, and its ظَهْر to one on<br>\
the other side. (Az.) ―<br>\
-b15-  مَا نَزَلَ مِنَ القُرْآنِ آيَةٌ إِلَّا<br>\
لَهَا ظَهْرٌ وَبَطْنٌ, [part of] a saying of Mohammad,<br>\
[of which see the rest voce مُطَّلَعٌ,] means (assumed tropical:)  Not<br>\
a verse of the Kur-án has come down but it has a<br>\
verbal expression and an interpretation: (K, *<br>\
TA:) or a verbal expression and a meaning: or<br>\
that which has an apparent and a known [or an<br>\
exoteric] interpretation and that which has an<br>\
intrinsic [or esoteric] interpretation: (TA:) or<br>\
narration (K, TA) and admonition: (TA:) or<br>\
[it is to be read and to be understood and taught;<br>\
for] by the ظهر is meant the reading; and by the<br>\
بطن, the understanding and teaching. (TA.)<br>\
[See also بَطْنٌ.] ―<br>\
-b16-  ظَهْرٌ signifies also (tropical:)  Camels on<br>\
which people ride, and which carry goods; (S, *<br>\
A, * O, K, * TA;) camels that carry burdens upon<br>\
their backs in journeying: (TA:) [or] a beast:<br>\
or a camel for riding: (Mgh:) pl. ظُهْرَانٌ.<br>\
(TA.) It is said in a trad. of &#39;Arfajeh, فَتَنَاوَلَ<br>\
السَّيْفَ مِنَ الظَّهْرِ And he reached, or took in his<br>\
hand, the sword from the camels for carrying<br>\
burdens and for riding: and in another, أَتَأْذَنُ<br>\

our camels which we ride? (TA.) And one<br>\
says also, هُوَ عَلَى ظَهْرٍ (tropical:)  He is determined upon<br>\
travel: (K:) as though he had already mounted<br>\
a beast for that purpose. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b17-  [Hence,<br>\
app.,] (assumed tropical:)  Property consisting of camels and sheep<br>\
or goats: (TA:) or much property. (K, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b18-  (assumed tropical:)  The short side [or lateral half] of a<br>\
feather: (S, O, K:) pl. ظُهْرَانٌ: (S, M, K, TA,<br>\
&amp;c.:) opposed to بَطْنٌ, sing. of بُطْنَانٌ, (TA,)<br>\
which latter signifies the “ long sides: ” (S, TA:)<br>\
and ↓ ظُهَارٌ signifies the same as ظَهْرٌ, (K,) or the<br>\
same as ظُهْرَانٌ, being an irregular pl.; and this<br>\
is meant by the saying الظُّهَارُ بِالضَّمِ الجَمَاعَةُ,<br>\
mentioned in a later place in the K [in such a<br>\
manner as to have led to the supposition that<br>\
ظُهَارٌ is also syn. with جَمَاعَةٌ]: (TA:) AO says<br>\
that among the feathers of arrows are the ظُهَار,<br>\
which are those that are put [upon an arrow] of<br>\
the ظَهْر [or outer side] of the عَسِيب [app. here<br>\
meaning the shaft] of the feather; (S, TA;)<br>\
i. e., the shorter side, which is the best kind of<br>\
feather; as also ظُهْرَان: sing. ظَهْرٌ: (TA:) ISd<br>\
says that the ظُهْرَان are those parts of the feathers<br>\
of the wing that are exposed to the sun and rain:<br>\
(TA:) Lth says that the ظُهَار are those parts of<br>\
the feathers of the wing that are apparent. (O,<br>\
TA.) One says, رِشْ سَهْمَكَ بِظُهْرَانٍ وَلَا تَرِشْهُ بِبُطْنَانٍ<br>\
[Feather thine arrow with short sides of feathers,<br>\
and feather it not with long sides of feathers].<br>\
(S, TA.) [De Sacy supposes that ظُهُورٌ and<br>\
بُطُونٌ are also pls. of ظَهْرٌ and بَطْنٌ thus used:<br>\
(see his “ Chrest. Arabe,” sec. ed., tome ii., p.<br>\
374:) but his reasons do not appear to me to be<br>\
conclusive.] ↓ ظُهَارٌ and ظُهْرَانٌ are also used as<br>\
epithets: you say, رِيشٌ ظُهَارٌ and رِيشٌ ظُهْرَانٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b19-  [ظَهْرُ الكَفِّ and ↓ ظَاهِرُهَا mean (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\

and ↓ ظَاهِرُهَا mean (assumed tropical:)  The upper, or convex, side,<br>\
or back, of the human foot, corresponding to the<br>\
back of the hand, including the instep: opposed<br>\

upper surface of the tongue.] ―<br>\
-b20-  And ظَهْرٌ also<br>\
signifies (tropical:)  A way by land. (S, M, O, Msb, K.)<br>\
This expression is used when there is a way by<br>\
land and a way by sea. (M.) You say, سَارُوا<br>\
فِى طَرِيقِ الظَّهْرِ (tropical:)  They journeyed by land. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b21-  And (assumed tropical:)  An elevated tract of land or ground;<br>\
as also ↓ ظَاهِرةٌ: (A:) or rugged and elevated<br>\
land or ground; (JK, K;) as also ↓ ظَاهِرَةٌ:<br>\
(JK:) opposed to بَطْنٌ, which signifies “ soft<br>\
and plain and fine and low land or ground: ”<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ ظَوَاهِرُ [pl. of. ظَاهِرَةٌ] signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  elevated tracts of land or ground: (S, K:) you<br>\
say, هَاجَتْ ظَوَاهِرُ الأَرْضِ, meaning, (assumed tropical:)  the herbs,<br>\
or leguminous plants, of the elevated tracts of<br>\
land, or ground, dried up: (As, S, L:) and<br>\
↓ ظَاهِرٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  the higher, or highest, part of a<br>\
mountain; (ISh, L, TA;) whether its exterior be<br>\
plain or not: (TA:) and ↓ ظَاهِرَةٌ, the same, of<br>\
anything: (L:) when you have ascended upon<br>\
the ظَهْر of a mountain, you are upon its ظَاهِرَة.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b22-  سَالَ وَادِيهِمْ ظَهْرًا means (assumed tropical:)  Their valley<br>\
flowed with the rain of their own land: opposed<br>\
to دُرْءًا, meaning, “from other rain: ” (IAar, O,<br>\
K: *) or the former signifies their valley flowed<br>\
with its own rain: and the latter, “with other<br>\
than its own rain: ” (TA:) and some say<br>\
↓ ظُهْرًا, which Az thinks the better form. (O,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b23-  [Hence, probably,] أَصَبْتُ مِنْهُ مَطَرَ ظَهْرٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I obtained from him, or it, much good. (Sgh,<br>\
O, K.) ―<br>\
-b24-  And another signification of ظَهْرٌ is<br>\
What is absent, or hidden, or concealed, from one.<br>\
(O, K.) ―<br>\
-b25-  It is sometimes prefixed to another<br>\
noun to give plainness and force to the expression; as in ظَهْرُ الغَيْبِ and ظَهْرُ القَلْبِ, meaning<br>\
نَفْسُ الغَيْبِ and نَفْسُ القَلْبِ: (Msb:) or it is<br>\
redundant in these instances. (Mgh.) Lebeed<br>\
says, describing a [wild] cow going about after a<br>\
beast of prey that had eaten her young one,<br>\
وَتَسَمَّعَتْ رِزَّ الأَنِيسِ فَرَاعَهَا<br>\
عَنْ ظَهْرِ غَيْبٍ وَالأَنِيسُ سَقَامُهَا<br>\
[And she heard the sound of man, and it frightened her, from a place that concealed what was in<br>\
it; for man is her malady; i. e., a cause of pain<br>\
and trouble and death to her]: (TA:) meaning,<br>\
she heard the sound of the hunters, &amp;c. (TA in<br>\
art. غيب.) And you say, تَنَاوَلَهُ بِظَهْرِ الغَيْبِ بِمَا<br>\
يَسُوؤُهُ He carped at him behind the back, or in<br>\
absence, by saying what would grieve him. (TA<br>\
in art. غيب.) And تَكَلَّمْتُ بِهِ عَنْ ظَهْرِ الغَيْبِ<br>\
(A, O) or عن ظَهْرِ غَيْبٍ (TA) [app., (tropical:)  I spoke it<br>\
by memory; in the absence of a book or the like;<br>\
as one says in modern Arabic, عَلَى الغَائِب. See<br>\
also غَيْبٌ.] And قَرَأَهُ عَنْ ظَهْرِ القَلْبِ (tropical:)  He recited<br>\
it by heart, or memory; without book: (L, K:<br>\
[in the latter, مِنْ is put in the place of عَنْ; but<br>\
the right reading is that in the L: and in the CK<br>\
is an omission here, to be supplied by the insertion of وَقَرَأَهُ:]) and ↓ قرأه ظَاهِرًا and قرأه عَلَى<br>\
ظَهْرِ لِسَانِهِ [signify the same]. (K.) And حَمَلَ<br>\
القُرْآنَ عَلَى ظَهْرِ لِسَانِهِ like حَفِظَهُ عَلَى ظَهْرِ قَلْبِهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [He knew the Kur-án by heart]. (A, * O, TA.)<br>\

-b26-  One says also, فُلَانٌ يَأْكُلُ عَلَى ظَهْرِ يَدِ فُلَانٍ<br>\
(tropical:)  Such a one eats at the expense of such a one.<br>\

عَلَى ظَهْرِ أَيْدِى النَّاسِ (tropical:)  The poor eat at the expense of the people. (A, TA.) And أَعْطَاهُ عَنْ<br>\
ظَهْرِ يَدٍ (tropical:)  He gave him originally; without compensation. (O, * K; but in some copies of the K<br>\
we find مِنْ in the place of عَنْ.) It is said [in a<br>\
trad.], أَفْضَلُ الصَّدَقَةِ مَا كَانَ عَنْ ظَهْرِ غِنًى (tropical:)  The<br>\
most excellent of alms is that which is [derived]<br>\
from competence; ظهر: (Msb:) or<br>\
simply عَنْ غِنًى, the word ظهر being here redundant: (Mgh:) or from manifest competence upon<br>\
which one relies, and in which he seeks aid against<br>\
calamities, or afflictions: or from what remains<br>\
after fight: (Msb:) or from superfluous property.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also ظَهِيرٌ<br>\
-A3-  قِدْرُ ظَهْرٍ means (assumed tropical:)  An<br>\

and fem.; unless when the word صَلَاة is prefixed<br>\
to it, in which case it is fem. only: (Msb:) [pl.<br>\
أَظْهَارٌ. See also ظَهِيرَةٌ.] صَلَاةُ الظُّهْرِ means The<br>\
prayer [i. e. the divinely-ordained prayer] of midday, or noon: (IAth, TA:) or of the time after<br>\
the declining of the sun. (S, O.) In the phrases<br>\
أَبْرِدُوا بِالظُّهْرِ [Defer ye the prayer of midday until<br>\
the cooler time of day] and صَلَّى الظُّهْرَ [He performed the prayer of midday], the prefixed<br>\
noun (صَلَاة) is suppressed. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  سَالَ<br>\
وَادِيهِمْ ظُهْرًا: see ظَهْرٌ, last quarter.<br>\

ظِهْرِىٌّ A camel prepared for future need; (T,<br>\
S, O, K;) taken, by way of precaution, to bear<br>\
the burden of any camel that may happen to fail<br>\
in a journey: sometimes two or more unladen<br>\
camels are taken for this purpose: some say that<br>\
such a camel is thus called because its owner<br>\
puts it behind his back, not riding it nor putting<br>\
any burden upon it: (T, TA:) the word appears<br>\
to be an irreg. rel. n. from ظَهْرٌ: (ISd, TA:) pl.<br>\
ظَهَارِىٌّ, imperfectly decl., because the rel. ى<br>\
retains its place in the sing. [inseparably; there<br>\
being no such word as ظِهْر: but if it be a rel. n.,<br>\
this pl. is irreg., like مَهَارِىٌّ]. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\

against such a one: and عَلَى هٰذَا ↓ أَنَا ظِهْرَتُكَ<br>\

[lxvi. 4], وَالْمَلَائِكَةُ بَعْدَ ذٰلِكَ ظَهِيرٌ [And the angels<br>\
