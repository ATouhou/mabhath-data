ظَلَمَ, aor.<br>\
ظَلِمَ, has for its inf. n. ظَلْمٌ, (M,<br>\
Msb, K, and so in some copies of the S,) or<br>\
↓ ظُلْمٌ, (so in other copies of the S,) or both, (T,)<br>\
or the latter is a simple subst., (T, M, Msb, TA,)<br>\
which is put in the place of the inf. n., (TA,<br>\
[and the same is indicated in the T and K by the<br>\
saying that the proper inf. n. is with fet-h,]) and<br>\
↓ مَظْلِمَةٌ, (S, TA,) or this is likewise a simple<br>\
subst., (Msb,) and ↓ مَظْلَمَةٌ, [or this also is a<br>\
simple subst.,] and ↓ ظِلَامٌ also is said to be an<br>\
inf. n. like ظُلْمٌ, these two being like لِبَاسٌ and<br>\
لُبْسٌ, [or it is a simple subst. like as ظُلْمٌ is said<br>\
to be, or it is an inf. n. of 3, as such occurring in<br>\
the middle of this paragraph,] or, accord. to Kr,<br>\
it is pl. of ظُلْمٌ [like as رِمَاحٌ is pl. of رُمْحٌ]:<br>\
(TA:) [ظَلَمَ when intrans. generally means He<br>\
did wrong; or acted wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically: and when trans., he<br>\
wronged; or treated, or used, wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically; or he misused:] accord. to most of the lexicologists, (Er-Rághib, TA,) primarily, (As, T, S, Msb,) ↓ الظُّلْمُ<br>\
signifies the putting a thing in a place not its<br>\
own; putting it in a wrong place; misplacing it:<br>\
(As, T, S, M, Er-Rághib, Msb, K:) and it is<br>\
by exceeding or by falling short, or by deviating<br>\
from the proper time and place: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) or the acting in whatsoever way one pleases<br>\
in the disposal of the property of another: and<br>\
the transgressing the proper limit: (El-Munáwee,<br>\
TA:) [i. e.] the transgressing the proper limit<br>\
much or little: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or, accord. to<br>\
some, it primarily signifies النَّقْص [as meaning<br>\
the making to suffer loss, or detriment]: (MF,<br>\
TA:) and it is said to be of three kinds, between<br>\
man and God, and between man and man, and<br>\
between a man and himself; every one of which<br>\
three is really لِلنَّفْسِ [i. e. a wrongdoing to oneself]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [when it is used as a<br>\
simple subst.,] the pl. of ظُلْمٌ, accord. to Kr. is<br>\
ظِلَامٌ, as mentioned above, and ↓ ظُلَامٌ, with<br>\
damm, is said to be syn. with ظُلْمٌ, or a pl. thereof,<br>\
[of an extr. form, commonly regarded as that of<br>\
a quasi-pl. n.,] like رُخَالٌ. (TA.) One says,<br>\
مَنِ اسْتَرْعَى الذِّئْبَ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ [He who asks, or<br>\
desires, the wolf to keep guard surely does wrong,<br>\
or puts a thing in a wrong place]: a prov. (S,<br>\
Msb.) And مَنْ أَشْبَهَ أَبَاهُ فَمَا ظَلَمَ, (As, T, S,) a<br>\
prov., meaning [Whoso resembles his father in a<br>\
quality, or an attribute,] he has not put the likeness<br>\
in a wrong place. (As, T. [See art. شبه.]) وَلَمْ<br>\
تَظْلِمْ مِنْهُ شَيْئًا, in the Kur [xviii. 31], means<br>\
وَلَمْ تَنْقُصْ [i. e. And made not aught thereof to<br>\
suffer loss, or detriment]: (M, K:) and in like<br>\
manner Fr explains the saying in the Kur [ii. 54<br>\
and vii. 160], وَمَا ظَلَمُونَا وَلٰكِنْ كَانُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ<br>\
يَظْلِمُونَ And they made not us to suffer loss, or<br>\
detriment, by that which they did, but themselves<br>\
they made to suffer loss, or detriment: (T, TA:) in<br>\
which sense it seems to be indicated in the A that<br>\
the verb is tropical. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also trans.<br>\
by means of بِ; as in the phrase in the Kur [vii.<br>\
101 and xvii. 61] فَظَلَمُوا بِهَا, because the meaning is كَفَرُوا [i. e. And they disbelieved in them],<br>\
referring to the آيَات [or signs]; (M, TA; *) the<br>\
verb having this meaning tropically or by implication; or being thus made trans. because implying the meaning of التَّكْذِيب: or [the meaning<br>\
is, and they wronged themselves, or the people,<br>\
because of them; for], as some say, the ب is<br>\
causative, and the objective complement, i. e.<br>\
أَنْفُسَهُمْ, or النَّاسَ, is suppressed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
it is doubly trans. by itself: (TA:) one says,<br>\
ظَلَمَهُ حَقَّهُ [He made him to suffer loss, or detriment, of his right, or due; or defrauded, or despoiled, or deprived, him of it]; and حَقَّهُ ↓ تظلّمهُ:<br>\
(M, K:) [and] you say, فُلَانٌ ↓ تَظَلَّمَنِى, [as<br>\
well as تظلّمنى مَالِى, occurring in a verse cited<br>\
in the M,] meaning ظَلَمَنِى مَالِى [i. e. Such a one<br>\
caused me to suffer loss, &amp;c., of my property].<br>\
(S.) It is said in the Kur [iv. 44], إِنَّ اللّٰهَ لَا<br>\
يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ, for لَا يَظْلِمُهُمْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةِ, and the<br>\
verb is made doubly trans. because the meaning<br>\
is لَا يَسْلُبُهُمْ [i. e. Verily God will not despoil<br>\
them, or deprive them, of the weight of one of the<br>\
smallest of ants, or a grub of an ant, &amp;c.]: or<br>\
مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ, may be put in the place of the inf. n.,<br>\
for ظَلْمًا حَقِيرًا كَمِثْقَالِ ذَرَّةٍ [i. e. with a paltry<br>\
spoliation or deprivation, such as the weight of one of<br>\
the smallest of ants, &amp;c.]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  One says also,<br>\
أَرَادَ ظِلَامَهُ and مُظَالَمَتَهُ, [these two nouns being<br>\
inf. ns. of ↓ ظَالَمَهُ, or the former, as mentioned<br>\
above, is, accord. to some, an inf. n. of ظَلَمَ,]<br>\
meaning ظُلْمَهُ or ظَلْمَهُ [i. e. He desired the<br>\
wronging, &amp;c., of him]. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  ظَلَمَهُ,<br>\
inf. n. ظُلْمٌ [or ظَلْمٌ?], also means He imposed<br>\
upon him a thing that was above his power, or ability.<br>\
(TA.) And يُظْلَمُ He is asked for a thing that is<br>\
above his power, or ability. (S.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And one<br>\
says, ظَلَمَ البَعِيرَ (tropical:)  He slaughtered the camel without disease. (S, K, TA.) And ظُلِمَتِ النَّاقَةُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The she-camel was slaughtered without disease:<br>\
or was covered without her desiring the stallion.<br>\
(M.) And ظَلَمَ الحِمَارُ الأَتَانَ (tropical:)  The he-ass leaped<br>\
the she-ass (K, TA) before her time: (TA:) or<br>\
when she was pregnant: (K, TA:) so in the A.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And ظَلَمَ الوَطْبَ, (S, K,) inf. n. ظُلْمٌ<br>\
[or ظَلْمٌ?], (S,) (tropical:)  He gave to drink of the milk of<br>\
his skin before its becoming thick (S, K, TA) and<br>\
its butter&#39;s coming forth. (TA. [And the like is<br>\
said in the T and M.]) And ظَلَمَ القَوْمَ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
gave to drink to the people, or party, (T, M, K,)<br>\
milk before it had attained to maturity, (T, K,)<br>\
as related on the authority of A &#39;Obeyd, (T,) or<br>\
[milk such as is termed] ظَلِيمَة: (M:) but this is<br>\
a mistake: it is related on the authority of<br>\
Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà [i. e. Th] and AHeyth that<br>\
one says, ظَلَمْتُ السِّقَآءَ, and اللَّبَنَ, meaning I<br>\
drank, or gave to drink, what was in the skin,<br>\
and the milk, before its attaining to maturity and<br>\
the extracting of its butter: accord. to ISk, one<br>\
says, ظَلَمْتُ وَطْبِىَ القَوْمَ, [but I think that it is<br>\
correctly ظَلَمْتُ وَطْبِى لِلْقَومِ, agreeably with a<br>\
verse cited in the T and M,] meaning I gave to<br>\
drink [to the people, or party,] the contents of my<br>\
milk-skin before the thickening thereof. (T.)<br>\
And ظَلَمْتُهُ is said of anything as meaning (assumed tropical:)  I<br>\
did it hastily, or hurriedly, before its proper time,<br>\
or season. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  ظَلَمْتُ الحَوْضَ means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I made the watering-trough in a place in which<br>\
watering-troughs should not be made. (ISk, T.)<br>\
And ظَلَمَ الأَرْضَ means (tropical:)  He dug the ground in<br>\
what was not the place of digging: (M, K, TA:)<br>\
or when it had not been dug before. (M.) And,<br>\
said of a torrent, (assumed tropical:)  It furrowed the earth in a<br>\
place that was not furrowed. (T.) And ظَلَمَ<br>\
البِطَاحَ, said of a torrent, (tropical:)  It reached the بطاح<br>\
[or wide water-courses containing fine, or broken,<br>\
pebbles, &amp;c.], not having reached them before.<br>\
(A, TA.) And ظَلَمَ الوَادِى (tropical:)  The water of the<br>\
valley reached a place that it had not reached<br>\
before. (Fr, T, S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  When men have<br>\
added upon the grave other than its own earth,<br>\
لَا تَظْلِمُوا (tropical:)  [Transgress not ye the proper limit]<br>\
is said to them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  And one says, لَا<br>\
تَظْلِمْ وَضَحَ الطَّرِيقِ (assumed tropical:)  Turn not thou from the<br>\
main part, or the beaten track, of the road.<br>\
(M.) And لَا تَظْلِمْ عَنْهُ شَيْئَا (assumed tropical:)  Turn not thou<br>\
from it at all. (T.) And لَزِمَ الطَّرِيقَ فَلَمْ يَظْلِمْهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [He kept to the road, and] did not turn from it<br>\
to the right and left. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  And مَا ظَلَمَكَ<br>\
أَنْ تَفْعَلَ (T, K, TA) (tropical:)  What has prevented thy<br>\
doing (K, TA) such a thing? (TA.) A man<br>\
complained to Abu-l-Jarráh of his suffering<br>\
indigestion from food that he had eaten, and he<br>\
said to him, مَا ظَلَمَكَ أَنْ تَقِىْءَ (assumed tropical:)  [What has<br>\
prevented thy vomiting?]. (Fr, T.) And one<br>\
says, مَا ظَلَمَكَ عَنْ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  What has prevented<br>\
thee from such a thing? (T.) Respecting the<br>\
saying<br>\
قَالَ بَلَى يَا مَىَّ وَاليَوْمُ ظَلَمْ<br>\
[addressed by a man to a woman who had invited him to visit her], Fr says, they say that the<br>\
meaning is حَقًّا [Truly, or in truth; i. e. He<br>\
said, Yes, O Meiya, truly, or in truth, I will<br>\
visit thee]; and it is a prov.; (T;) or اليَوْمُ ظَلَمَ,<br>\
or بَلَى وَاليَوْمُ ظَلَمَ, is a prov.; (Meyd;) and thus<br>\
it was expl. by IAar, as used in the manner of<br>\
an oath: but Fr says, in my opinion the meaning<br>\
is, and a day in which is a cause of prevention<br>\
shall not prevent me: [so that the words of the<br>\
hemistich above may be rendered, he said, Yes,<br>\
O Meiya, though the day present an obstacle,<br>\
for I will overcome every obstacle]: (T:)<br>\
accord. to Kr, قَدِمَ فُلَانٌ وَاليَوْمُ ظَلَمَ means Such<br>\
a one came truly, or in truth: [or it may be<br>\
rendered such a one came though the day presented an obstacle:] but in the saying<br>\
إِنَّ الفِرَاقَ اليَوْمَ وَاليَوْمُ ظَلَمْ<br>\
the meaning is said by some to be وَاليَوْمُ ظَلَمَنَا<br>\
[i. e. Verily separation is to-day, and the day has<br>\
wronged (us)]: or, as some say, ظلم here means,<br>\
has put the thing in a wrong place: (M:)<br>\
accord. to ISk, the phrase وَاليَوْمُ ظَلَم means<br>\
[And, or but, or though,] the day has put the<br>\
affair in a wrong place. (T.) [See also Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Prov. ii. 911.]<br>\
-A2-  ظَلِمَ, said of the night:<br>\
see 4.<br>\
2<br>\
ظلّمهُ, inf. n. تَظْلِيمٌ, (T, S, &amp;c.,) He told<br>\
him that he was ظَالِم [i. e. doing wrong or acting<br>\
wrongfully &amp;c., or a wrongdoer]: (T:) or he<br>\
attributed, or imputed, to him ظُلْم [i. e. wrongdoing, &amp;c.]. (S, M, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He (a<br>\
judge) exacted justice for him from his wronger,<br>\
and aided him against him. (T.)<br>\
3<br>\
ظَاْلَمَ see 1, in the middle of the paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
اظلم, said of the night, (Fr, T, S, M, Msb,<br>\
K,) and ↓ ظَلِمَ, (Fr, T, S, K,) the latter with<br>\
kesr, (S,) like سَمِعَ, (K,) [erroneously written in<br>\
the TT as from the M ظَلَمَ,] It became dark; (S,<br>\
K;) or it became black; (M;) or it came with<br>\
its darkness. (Msb.) It is said in the Kur [ii.<br>\
19], وَإِذَا أَظْلَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ قَامُوا [And when it becomes<br>\
dark to them they stand still]; the verb being<br>\
intrans.: or, accord. to the Ksh, and Bd follows<br>\
it, it may be trans. [so that the meaning is, and<br>\
when He makes their place dark &amp;c.]; as is<br>\
shown by another reading, which is أُظْلِمُوا:<br>\
accord. to AHei, it is known by transmission as<br>\
only intrans.; but Z makes it to be trans. by<br>\
itself; Ibn-Es-Saláh affirms it to be trans. and<br>\
intrans.: and Az [so in the TA, but correctly<br>\
ISd, in the M,] mentions the saying, تَكَلَّمَ فَأَظْلَمَ<br>\
عَلَيْنَا البَيعتَ (assumed tropical:)  [He spoke, and made dark to us<br>\
the house, or chamber, or tent], meaning he made<br>\
us to hear what we disliked, or hated, the verb<br>\
being trans. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And أَظْلَمُوا They entered<br>\
upon the ظَلَام [or darkness, or beginning of<br>\
night]: (S, M, Msb, K:) or, as in the Mufradát<br>\
[of Er-Rághib], they became in darkness. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And they said, مَا أَظْلَمَهُ and ما أَضْوَأَهُ [How<br>\
dark is it! and How light, or bright, is it!];<br>\
which is anomalous. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And اظلم<br>\
الثَّغْرُ The front teeth glistened. (T, K.) Hence<br>\
the saying [of a poet],<br>\
إِذَا مَا اجْتَلَى الرَّائِى إِلَيْهَا بِطَرْفِهِ<br>\
غُرُوبَ ثَنَايَاهَا أَضَآءَ وَأَظْلَمَا<br>\
[as though meaning, When the beholder of her<br>\
with his eye looks at the fineness, or sharpness,<br>\
(but غُرُوب is variously explained,) of her central<br>\
teeth, it shines brightly, and glistens: but Az<br>\
plainly indicates another meaning; i. e., he sees<br>\
(lit. lights on, or finds,) brightness and lustre; for<br>\
he immediately adds, without the intervention of<br>\
وَ or أَوْ, evidently in relation to this verse,] أَضَآءَ<br>\
أَىْ أَصَابَ ضَوْءًا وَأَظْلَمَ أَصَابَ ظَلْمًا: (T:) [and<br>\
ISd cites the verse above with the substitution of<br>\
بِعَينِهِ for بِطَرْفِهِ and of أَنَارَ for أَضَآءَ immediately<br>\
after saying that] أَظْلَمَ signifies he looked at the<br>\
teeth and saw lustre (الظَّلْمَ). (M.) [In the K,<br>\
next after the explanation of اظلم الثَّغْرُ given<br>\
above, it is added that اظلم said of a man signifies أَصَابَ ظَلْمًا: thus, with fet-h, to the ظ,<br>\
accord. to the TA: in my MS. copy of the K<br>\
and in the CK, ظُلْمًا, which is doubtless a mistranscription.]<br>\
5<br>\
تظلّم مِنْهُ CCC (T, S, M, K, [but in some copies<br>\
of the S, منه is omitted,]) He complained of his<br>\
ظُلْم [or wrongdoing, &amp;c.], (S, M, K,) إِلَى الحَاكِمِ<br>\
[to the judge]: (T:) in some copies of the S,<br>\
تُظُلِّمَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تظلّم signifies also He<br>\
transferred the responsibility for the ظُلْم [or<br>\
wrongdoing, &amp;c.,] upon himself, (M, K,) accord.<br>\
to IAar, who has cited as an ex.,<br>\
كَانَتْ إِذَا غَضِبَتْ عَلَىَّ تَظَلَّمَتْ<br>\
[as though meaning She used, when she was angry<br>\
with me, to transfer the responsibility for the<br>\
wrongdoing upon herself; which may mean that<br>\
she finally confessed the wrongdoing to be hers];<br>\
but [ISd says] I know not how that is: the<br>\
تَظَلُّم in this case is only the complaining of<br>\
الظُّلْم; for when she was angry with him, it<br>\
was not allowable [to say] that she attributed<br>\
the ظُلْم to herself. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 1, former<br>\
half, in two places.<br>\
6<br>\
تظالم القَوْمُ (S, M, Msb) The people, or company of men, treated, or used, one another wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically (ظَلَمَ<br>\
بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا). (M, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence]<br>\
تَظَالَمَتِ المِعْزَى (tropical:)  The goats smote one another<br>\
with their horns by reason of their being fat and<br>\
having abundance of herbage. (IAar, M, TA.)<br>\
One says, وَجَدْنَا أَرْضًا تَظَالَمَ مِعْزَاهَا (tropical:)  We found a<br>\
land whereof the goats smote one another with<br>\
their horns by reason of satiety and liveliness.<br>\
(T, TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْظَلَمَ see the next paragraph.<br>\
8<br>\
اِظَّلَمَ (T, S, M, K) and اِظْطَلَمَ and اِطَّلَمَ,<br>\
(S, M,) which last is [said to be] the most usual,<br>\
(S,) [but I have mostly found the first to be used,]<br>\
of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ, (S, M,) He took upon himself [the bearing of] ظُلْم [or wrong, &amp;c.,] in<br>\
spite of difficulty, trouble, or inconvenience: (S,<br>\
TA:) or he bore الظُّلْم [or wrong, &amp;c.,] (T, M,<br>\
K, TA,) willingly, being able to resist; (T, TA;)<br>\
and ↓ اِنْظَلَمَ signifies [thus likewise, or] he bore<br>\
الظُّلْم. (S, M, K.)<br>\
ظَلْمٌ The lustre, and brightness, of gold. (Z,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (Z, TA,) The lustre (lit.<br>\
running water) upon the teeth; (Lth, T, Z, TA;)<br>\
the lustre (مَآء, S, M, K, and بَرِيق, S, K) of the<br>\
teeth, (Lth, T, S, M, Z, K, TA,) from the clearness of the colour, not from the saliva, (Lth, * T, *<br>\
M,) like blackness within the bone thereof, by reason<br>\
of the intense whiteness, (S, K,) resembling the فِرِنْد<br>\
[q. v.] of the sword, (S, K,) or appearing like the<br>\
فِرِنْد [of the sword], so that one imagines that there<br>\
is in it a blackness, by reason of the intense lustre<br>\
and clearness: (M:) or, accord. to Sh, whiteness<br>\
of the teeth, as though there were upon it [somewhat of] a blackness: or, as Abu-l-&#39;Abbás ElAhwal says, in the Expos. of the “ Kaabeeyeh,”<br>\
lustre (lit. running water) of the teeth, such that<br>\
one sees upon it, by reason of its intense clearness<br>\
[app. meaning transparency], what resembles dustcolour and blackness: or, accord. to another explanation, fineness, or thinness, and intense whiteness,<br>\
of the teeth: (TA:) pl. ظُلُومٌ. (S, M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
Snow: (M, K:) it is said to have this meaning:<br>\
and the phrase مُشْرَبَةِ الثَّنَايَا بِمَآءِ الظَّلْمِ, used by a<br>\
poet, may mean [Having the central teeth suffused<br>\
with the lustre termed ظَلْم, as is indicated in the<br>\
T and S, or] with the water of snow. (Lth, T.)<br>\
ظُلْمٌ [as a simple subst. generally means Wrong,<br>\
wrongdoing, injustice, injuriousness, or tyranny]:<br>\
see 1, first sentence, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [ظُلْمُ<br>\
الارضِ in the CK is a mistranscription for ظَلَمَ<br>\
الأَرْضَ. ―<br>\
-b3-  And الظُلْمُ in one place in the CK,<br>\
as syn. with الظَّلْمَآءُ, is a mistake for الظُّلْمَةُ.]<br>\
لَقِيتُهُ أَدْنَى ظَلَمٍ, (S, M, K,) or أَدْنَى ذِى ظَلَمٍ,<br>\
(K, TA, [in the CK اَوَّلَ ذِى ظَلَمٍ,]) means (tropical:)  I<br>\
met him the first of everything: (S, K, TA:) or<br>\
the first thing: (M:) or when the darkness was<br>\
becoming confused: (M, K:) or أَدْنَى ظَلَمٍ means<br>\
near; (El-Umawee, S, M, K;) or nearness:<br>\
(M, K:) and one says, هُوَ مِنْكَ أَدْنَى ذِى ظَلَمٍ<br>\
[app. He is near thee], and رَأَيْتُهُ أَدْنَى ذِى ظَلَمٍ<br>\
[app. I saw him near]: (M:) and ظَلَمٌ is also<br>\
syn. with شَخْصٌ [as meaning an object seen from<br>\
a distance, or a person]; (K;) or, as some say,<br>\
it has this meaning in the phrase أَدْنَى ظَلَمٍ [so<br>\
that لَقِيتُهُ أَدْنَى ظَلَمٍ may mean I met him the<br>\
nearest object seen from a distance, or the nearest<br>\
person]: (M:) and accord. to Kh, one says,<br>\
↓ لَقِيتُهُ أَدْنَى ظُلْمَةٍ, or أَوَّلَ ذِى ظُلْمَةٍ, (as in different copies of the S,) meaning I met him the<br>\
first thing that obstructed my sight. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ظَلَمٌ<br>\
signifies also A mountain: and the pl. is ظُلُومٌ.<br>\
(M, K.)<br>\
ظُلَمٌ an appellation of Three nights (T, S, K)<br>\
of the lunar month (T, S) next after the three<br>\
called دُرَعٌ; (T, S, * K; *) so says A&#39;Obeyd: (T:)<br>\
thus called because of their darkness: (S:) the<br>\
sing. is ↓ ظَلْمَآءُ; (T, S;) so that it is anomalous;<br>\
for by rule it should be ظُلْمٌ; (S;) and the sing.<br>\
of دُرَعٌ is دَرْعَآءُ: so says A&#39;Obeyd: but accord. to<br>\
AHeyth and Mbr, the sings. are ↓ ظُلْمَةٌ and<br>\
دُرْعَةٌ, agreeably with rule; and this is the correct<br>\
assertion. (T. [See more in art. درع, voce أَدْرَعُ.])<br>\
ظِلَمٌ: see ظِلَّامٌ.<br>\
ظُلْمَةٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ ظُلُمَةٌ (S, M, K)<br>\
[accord. to the CK ظُلْمٌ and ظُلُمٌ, both of which<br>\
are wrong,] and ↓ ظَلْمَآءُ (S, M, Msb, K) Darkness; contr. of نُورٌ: (S, Msb:) or nonexistence of<br>\
نُور [or light]: or an accidental state that precludes<br>\
the coëxistence therewith of نُور: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) or the departure of light; as also ↓ ظَلَامٌ;<br>\
(M, K;) which last has no pl.; (T, TA;) or<br>\
this last signifies the beginning, or first part, of<br>\
night, (S, M, Msb,) even though it be one in which<br>\
the moon shines; and is said by Sb to be used<br>\
only adverbially; one says, أَتَيْتُهُ ظَلَامًا, meaning<br>\
I came to him at night, and مَعَ الظَّلَامِ i. e. at<br>\
the time of the night: (M, TA:) the pl. of ظُلْمَةٌ<br>\
is ظُلَمٌ and ظُلُمَاتٌ and ظُلَمَاتٌ (T, S, Msb) and<br>\
ظُلْمَاتٌ, (S, Msb,) or, accord. to IB, the first of<br>\
these pls. is of ظُلْمَةٌ and the second is of ظُلُمَةٌ.<br>\
(TA.) One says, ↓ هُوَ يَخْبِطُ الظَّلَامَ [or فِى الظَّلَامِ,<br>\
expl. in art. خبط], and الظُّلْمَةَ [which means the<br>\
same] and ↓ الظَّلْمَآءَ [which is also expl. in art.<br>\
خبط]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ظُلْمَةٌ is also [tropically] used<br>\
as a term for (assumed tropical:)  Ignorance: and (assumed tropical:)  belief in a<br>\
plurality of gods: and (assumed tropical:)  transgression, or unrighteousness: like as نُورٌ is used as a term for<br>\
their contraries: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and it is<br>\
said in the A that الظُّلْمُ is ظُلْمَةٌ, like as العَدْلُ<br>\
is نُورٌ. (TA.) ظُلُمَاتُ البَحْرِ means (assumed tropical:)  The troubles,<br>\
afflictions, calamities, or hardships, of the sea.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
-A2-  And one says لَيْلَةٌ ظُلْمَةٌ, [using the<br>\
latter word as an epithet, (in the CK, erroneously, ظَلِمَةٌ,)] and ↓ لَيْلَةٌ ظَلْمَآءُ, both meaning<br>\
A night intensely dark; (M, K;) or the latter<br>\
means مُظْلِمَةٌ [i. e. dark, or black]: (S:) and<br>\
↓ لَيْلٌ ظَلْمَآءُ also, (M, K,) which is anomalous,<br>\
(K,) mentioned by IAar, but [ISd says] this is<br>\
strange, and in my opinion he has put لَيْلٌ in the<br>\
place of لَيْلَةٌ, as in his mentioning لَيْلٌ قَمْرَآءُ [q. v.].<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\

the outer angle of the eye, with anger, or aversion]. (K.)<br>\
ظَلُومٌ: see ظَلَّامٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says اِمْرَأَةٌ<br>\
ظَلُومٌ لِلسِّقَآءِ (assumed tropical:)  [A woman wont to give to drink the<br>\
milk of the skin before its attaining to maturity<br>\
and the extracting of its butter: see ظَلَمَ الوَطْبَ,<br>\
and what follows it, in the first paragraph]. (M.)<br>\
ظَلِيمٌ [as syn. with مَظْلُومٌ in the primary<br>\
sense of the latter I have not found: but as an<br>\
epithet in which the quality of a subst. predominates it signifies] (tropical:)  Milk that is drunk before<br>\
its becoming thick and its butter&#39;s coming forth or<br>\
being extracted; (S, * M;) as also ↓ ظَلِيمَةٌ, (T,<br>\

-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  A place<br>\

grave was dug in a place not proper for digging<br>\
[it]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  The earth of land that is<br>\

لَحْد [or lateral hollow] of a grave; which is put<br>\

K:) said (by IDrd, TA) to be so called because<br>\
he makes a place for the laying and hatching of<br>\
the eggs (يُدَحِّى, inf. n. تَدْحِيَةٌ,) where the doing<br>\
so is not proper: (M, TA:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib and others, because he is believed to be<br>\
deaf: (TA:) pl. ظِلْمَانٌ (T, M, K) and ظُلْمَانٌ<br>\
(M, K) and أَظْلِمَةٌ, (T, M,) which last is a pl. of<br>\
pauc. (T.) ―<br>\

curved end of the bow [i. e.<br>\
λ and<br>\
μ, above the<br>\
nine stars called النَّعَائِم, or “ the ostriches ”].<br>\
(Kzw in his descr. of Sagittarius.) And الظَّلِيمُ<br>\
is the name of The bright star [<br>\
α] at the<br>\
end of النَّهْر [i. e. Eridanus]: and A star upon<br>\
the mouth of الحُوت [i. e. Piscis Australis]<br>\
(Kzw in his descr. of Eridanus.) [It seems to<br>\
be implied in the K that الظَّلِيمُ is the name of<br>\
two stars; or it may be there meant that each of<br>\
two stars is thus called. Freytag represents the<br>\
sing. as “ a name of stars,” and the dual also as<br>\
“ a name of stars; ” referring, in relation to the<br>\
former, to Ideler&#39;s “ Untersuch,” pp. 201, 228,<br>\
and 233; and in relation to the latter, to the<br>\
same work, pp. 106 and 184.]<br>\

The more wrongful in conduct of me and of thee<br>\

اللّٰهُ أَظْلَمِى وَأَظْلَمَكَ i. e. [May God curse] the<br>\
more wrongful in conduct of us. (K. [But in<br>\
the TA, a doubt is intimated as to the correctness<br>\
of this latter saying.]) One says also, لَهُوَ أَظْلَمُ<br>\
مِنْ حَيَّةٍ [i. e. Verily he is more wrongful in conduct than a serpent]: because it comes to a<br>\
