ظَرُفَ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) inf. n. ظَرَافَةٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) or ظَرْفٌ and ظَرَافَةٌ, (T, M, Mgh, * O, K,)<br>\
but the latter is rare, (K,) allowable in poetry,<br>\
(T, M,) or, as some say, is of frequent occurrence, and confirmed by analogy, (MF, TA,)<br>\
said of a man, (S, O,) [or only of a young man,<br>\
and ظَرُفَت of a young woman,] He possessed the<br>\
quality, or qualities, termed ظَرْف meaning as<br>\
expl. below [i. e. excellence, or elegance, in mind,<br>\
manners, and address or speech; and in person,<br>\
countenance, or garb, guise, or external appearance; or all of these qualities combined: he was,<br>\
or became, clever, ingenious, intelligent, or acute<br>\
in intellect; well-mannered, well-bred, accomplished, or polite; beautiful in person or countenance; elegant, or graceful; or elegant in garb,<br>\
guise, or external appearance]. (T, S, O, Msb,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also what here follows.<br>\
3<br>\
ظَاْرَفَ ↓ ظَارَفَنِى فَظَرَفْتُهُ [He vied, or contended,<br>\
with me in ظَرْف] and I was more ظَرِيف (كُنْتُ<br>\
↓ أَظْرَفَ) than he. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اظرف He (a man) had many [ظُرُوف, or]<br>\
receptacles [of any kind]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He<br>\
begat, (S, Mgh, O, K,) or had born to him, (M,)<br>\
children that were ظُرَفَآء (S, M, O, K) or ظِرَاف<br>\
[pls. of ظَرِيف, q. v.]. Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اظرف بِالرَّجُلِ<br>\
He mentioned the man as possessing ظَرْف. (M,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And اظرف فِى العِبَارَةِ is explainable [as<br>\
meaning He was elegant, or eloquent, in the expression, or phrase, or speech], if the saying be<br>\
received from those who are trustworthy: if not,<br>\
it is correctly أَطْرَفَ, with the unpointed ط;<br>\
meaning “ he said what was novel and pleasing. ”<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  اظرف المَتَاعَ, (O,) in the K, erroneously, فُلَانًا, (TA,) He put, or assigned, or made,<br>\
a ظَرْف [or receptacle] for the goods. (O, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تظرّف He affected ظَرْف; (S, O, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ تظارف. (TA.) One says, فُلَانٌ يَتَظَرَّفُ<br>\
وَلَيْسَ بِظَرِيفٍ [Such a one affects ظَرْف and he is<br>\
not ظَرِيف]. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَظَاْرَفَ see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
10<br>\
استظرفهُ He found him [or held him] to be<br>\
ظَرِيف. (O, * TA.)<br>\
ظَرْفٌ A receptacle (Lth, T, S, M, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K) of anything; (Lth, T, M;) [a vessel,<br>\
or vase;] an إِبْرِيق is thus termed as being a<br>\
ظرف for what is in it: (Lth, T, TA:) and AHn<br>\
applies it to a seed-vessel, or pericarp, or a cell of<br>\
a pericarp: (M, TA:) [and it is also applied to<br>\
a case, or cover, for a book or the like:] the pl.<br>\
is ظُرُوفٌ: (T, S, * M, Mgh, O, Msb, K:) أَظْرَافٌ<br>\
is a mistake. (Mgh.) [Applying it to a vessel<br>\
of silver,] Har uses it as meaning “ silver. ” (P.<br>\
614 [referring to a phrase in p. 213].) One<br>\
says, أَخَذْتُ المَتَاعَ بِظَرْفِهِ [I took the goods with the<br>\
receptacle thereof]. (A, TA.) And hence, (A,<br>\
TA,) رَأَيْتُهُ بِظَرْفِهِ (tropical:)  I saw him himself. (A, O,<br>\
K, TA.) And هُوَ نَقِىُّ الظَّرْفِ (tropical:)  He is faithful,<br>\
(O, K, TA,) not treacherous. (M, O, K, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And hence (assumed tropical:)  [An adverbial noun of place or<br>\
of time, implying the meaning of the preposition<br>\
فى; and also by some applied to a noun of place<br>\
or of time together with that preposition; i. e.]<br>\
what are termed ظَرْفُ المَكَانِ and الزَّمَانِ, (O,)<br>\
pl. ظُرُوفُ الزَّمَانِ and المَكَانِ: (S, M: *) the descriptive terms that denote the places [or times] of<br>\
things are called ظُرُوفٌ: (Lth, T:) they are thus<br>\
termed by Kh; and by Ks, مَحَالُّ; and by Fr,<br>\
صِفَاتٌ. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also [Excellence, or elegance, in<br>\
mind, manners, and address or speech; and in<br>\
person, countenance, or garb, guise, or external<br>\
appearance; or all of these qualities combined:] a<br>\
term denoting a condition that combines the<br>\
generality of mental and bodily and extrinsic<br>\
excellences; likened [by reason of its comprehensiveness] to the receptacle thus called: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or cleverness, ingeniousness, intelligence, or acuteness in intellect; syn. كِيَاسَةٌ, (S,<br>\
O, K,) or كَيْسٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) and ذَكَآءٌ:<br>\
(Mgh:) or i. q. بَرَاعَةٌ, and ذَكَآءُ قَلْبٍ; [the<br>\
former meaning excellence in knowledge, or other<br>\
qualities; or accomplishment, or perfection, in<br>\
every excellence, and in goodliness;] (&#39;Eyn, M, O,<br>\
Msb, K; *) thus accord. to most of the copies of<br>\
the K [as well as the &#39;Eyn and M and O and<br>\
Msb], but correctly بَزَاعَة, with the letter زاى:<br>\
(TA:) [if so, these two explanations (بَزَاعَةٌ and<br>\
ذَكَآءُ قَلْبٍ) add nothing to others here given:] or<br>\
skilfulness (M, K, TA) in a thing (M, TA) is thus<br>\
termed by the people of El-Yemen: (TA:) or it is<br>\
in the tongue, (IAar, T, K,) only; (K;) meaning<br>\
beauty of expression, (M, L, TA,) and eloquence;<br>\
(L, TA;) and حَلَاوَةٌ is in the eyes, and مَلَاحَةٌ is in<br>\
the mouth, and جَمَالٌ is in the nose: (IAar, T:)<br>\
or beauty of garb, guise, or external appearance:<br>\
(M:) or beauty of face, and of garb, guise, or external appearance: (O, K:) or it is in the face and<br>\
in the tongue: (Ks, O, K:) or goodliness, or beauty;<br>\
and أَدَب [as having the meaning first assigned to<br>\
ظَرْفٌ in this sentence, i. e. excellence, or elegance,<br>\
in mind, manners, or address or speech; or as<br>\
meaning good breeding, good manners, politeness,<br>\
or polite accomplishments]: (Msb:) or, as an<br>\
inf. n., the being elegant, graceful, or beautiful:<br>\
and the being intelligent, sagacious, or acute in<br>\
intellect: (KL:) accord. to the author of the<br>\
&#39;Eyn, (O,) it is only an attribute of young men<br>\
and young women (M, O, Msb, * K) that are<br>\
acute in intellect, clever, or skilful; (M, O, K;)<br>\
not of elders, nor of lords, or chiefs: (M, K:)<br>\
but as meaning كِيْسٌ, it is common to young<br>\
persons and elders: (Msb:) some of those who<br>\
affect distinctness of speech by twisting the sides<br>\
of the mouth say that the word is ↓ ظُرْفٌ, with<br>\
damm, to distinguish it from ظَرْفٌ meaning “ a<br>\
receptacle; ” but this is a sheer mistake. (MF,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
ظُرْفٌ: see what immediately precedes.<br>\
[<br>\
ظَرْفِيَّةٌ, a term of grammar, The quality of<br>\
denoting place, or time, adverbially, by a noun<br>\
implying the meaning of the preposition فِى; and<br>\
also, accord. to some, by a noun together with<br>\
that preposition. One says مَنْصُوبٌ عَلَى الظَّرْفِيَّةِ,<br>\
meaning Put in the accusative case as denoting<br>\
place, or time, adverbially.]<br>\
ظُرَافٌ: see ظَرِيفٌ, near the beginning and near<br>\
the end.<br>\
[<br>\
ظَرُوفٌ perhaps signifies Possessing the quality,<br>\
or qualities, termed ظَرْف, in a great, or an extraordinary degree: used alike as masc. and fem.:<br>\
for I find it stated that] one says قَيْنَةٌ ظَرُوفٌ [A<br>\
female slave, or slave-songstress, that is very intelligent or skilful or elegant &amp;c.]. (TA. [But I<br>\
think it most probable that this is a mistranscripfor قِتْيَةٌ ظُرُوفٌ, a phrase which I find in the T,<br>\
and there expl. as meaning ظُرَفَآءُ.])<br>\
ظَرِيفٌ Possessing the quality, or qualities, termed<br>\
ظَرْف; (T, S, M, O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ ظُرَافٌ,<br>\
(Lh, M, O, K,) the two being like طَوِيلٌ and<br>\
طُوَالٌ, (O,) [or the latter has an intensive signification, (see طُوَالٌ, and see also the “ Durrat<br>\
el-Ghowwás,” in De Sacy&#39;s Anthol. Gramm.<br>\
Arabe, p. 48 of the Ar. text,)] and ↓ ظُرَّافٌ, (M,<br>\
K,) or this last, which is like طُوَّالٌ, denotes<br>\
more than ظُرَافٌ without teshdeed: (O:) accord.<br>\
to Mbr, it is derived from ظَرْف signifying “ a<br>\
receptacle,” as though meaning a receptacle for<br>\
excellence, or elegance, in mind, manners, or<br>\
address or speech: (TA:) [it may be rendered,<br>\
agreeably with explanations of ظَرْفٌ, excellent, or<br>\
elegant, in mind, manners, and address or speech;<br>\
and in person, countenance or garb, guise, or external appearance: or clever, ingenious, intelligent,<br>\
or acute in intellect; well-mannered, well-bred,<br>\
accomplished, or polite; beautiful in person or<br>\
countenance; elegant, or graceful; &amp;c.:] and is<br>\
expl. as meaning eloquent; thus by As and IAar:<br>\
and possessing knowledge and courage: and<br>\
goodly, or beautiful, in clothing, and in outer<br>\
apparel: (TA:) and is used by the people of<br>\
El-Yemen as meaning skilful: (O:) and, as Ks<br>\
says, it is applied as an epithet to a tongue, and<br>\
to a face: (TA:) the pl. of ظَرِيفٌ is ظِرَافٌ (S,<br>\
M, O, Msb, K) and ظُرَفَآءُ (T, S, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
ظَرِيفُونَ (O, K) and ظُرُفٌ, (S, M, IB, K,) a form<br>\
sometimes used, (IB, TA,) and ظُرُوفٌ, (T, S,<br>\
M, O, K,) also a form sometimes used, (S, O,)<br>\
approvable in poetry, (T,) as though formed from<br>\
ظَرْفٌ, or [anomalous] like مَذَاكِيرُ (S, O, K)<br>\
accord. to Kh (S, O) and Sb: (TA:) the pl.<br>\
of ↓ ظُرَافٌ is ظُرَفَآءُ: (Lh, M, K:) and the pl. of<br>\
↓ ظُرَّافٌ is ظُرَّافُونَ: (M, K:) the fem. of ظَرِيفٌ<br>\
is ظَرِيفَةٌ; and the pl. of this is ظِرَافٌ, (Sb, T, M,<br>\
Msb, TA,) like a pl. of the masc., (Sb, M, TA,)<br>\
and ظَرَائِفُ. (T, M, TA.) It is said in a trad.<br>\
of &#39;Omar, mentioned by IAar, (Mgh, O, TA,)<br>\
and by As, (TA,) إِذَا كَانَ اللِّصُّ ظَرِيفًا لَا يُقْطَعُ,<br>\
(Mgh,) or لَمْ يُقْطَعْ, (O, TA,) meaning When the<br>\
thief is eloquent (Mgh, O, TA) and intelligent,<br>\
(Mgh,) he averts from himself the prescribed<br>\
punishment by his pleading [so that he will not be,<br>\
or is not, mutilated by amputation of the hand].<br>\
(Mgh, O, TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
ظَرِيفَةٌ, as a subst., A thing, and a saying, that<br>\
is ظَرِيف, meaning elegant, &amp;c.: pl. ظَرَائِفُ.]<br>\
ظُرَّافٌ: see ظَرِيفٌ, near the beginning and<br>\
near the end.<br>\
ظَارِفٌ [is distinguished from ظَرِيفٌ like as<br>\
شَارِفٌ is from شَرِيفٌ, q. v.]. Lh mentions the<br>\
saying اُظْرُفْ إِنْ كُنْتَ ظَارِفًا [Possess thou ظَرْف<br>\
if thou be one who will possess it]: in meaning the<br>\
actual state, they said إِنَّهُ لَظَرِيفٌ [Verily he is<br>\
one who possesses ظَرْف]. (M.)<br>\
أَظْرَفُ: see 3. Ks allows the saying, interrogatively, مَا أَظْرَفُ زَيْدٍ أَلِسَانُهُ أَظْرَفُ أَمٌ وَجْهُهُ [What<br>\
is the part that is the more excellent in ظَرْف (or<br>\
elegance, &amp;c.), of Zeyd? is his tongue the more so,<br>\
or his face?]. (TA.)<br>\
يَا مَظْرَفَانُ is an expression similar to يَا مَلْكَعَانُ<br>\
[and مَكْذَبَانُ &amp;c.; meaning O thou who possessest<br>\
the quality, or qualities, of ظَرْف in a great, or an<br>\
extraordinary degree]. (A, TA.)<br>\
