تظبّى, if used, means He acted like the<br>\
ظَبْى, or gazelle; being similar to تَذَأَّبَ and تَنَمَّرَ<br>\
&amp;c.: its part. n. is mentioned in the first paragraph of art. ربض.]<br>\
ظَبْىٌ A certain animal, (TA,) well known;<br>\
(S, Msb, K, TA;) the غَزَال [or gazelle; to which<br>\
the former word is applied when used unrestrictedly, and which is app. here meant by the<br>\
latter word, though this seems properly to signify<br>\
“ a young gazelle ”]; (M;) [it is the gazella<br>\
dorcas, also called antilope dorcas, of which the<br>\
ariel, or antilope Arabica, is said to be a variety;<br>\
or, accord. to some, each is a distinct species of<br>\
gazelle: the name seems to be properly, but not<br>\
always (as is shown by an explanation of رِئْمٌ),<br>\
applied only to the true antelope of Arabia and<br>\
adjacent countries, as distinguished from the cervine and bovine antelopes:] it is a name for the<br>\
male; which is also called تَيْسٌ, when he has<br>\
become what is termed a ثَنِىّ [q. v.], which he<br>\
continues to be termed until he dies: (AHát,<br>\
Msb, TA:) the female is called ظَبْيَةٌ, (AHát,<br>\
T, M, Msb, K, TA,) and عَنْزٌ and مَاعِزَةٌ: (AHát,<br>\
Msb, TA:) the dual is ظَبْيَانِ: (Msb, TA:) and<br>\
the pl. is أَظْبٍ, (S, M, Msb, K,) originally أَظْبُىٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb,) a pl. of pauc., (S,) and ظُبِىٌّ and ظِبَآءُ,<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K,) which last is of the masc. and<br>\
fem., (M, Msb,) and ظَبَيَاتٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
which is of the fem. (M, Msb.) One says, بِهِ<br>\
دَآءُ ظَبْىٍ [lit. In him is the disease of a gazelle];<br>\
meaning in him is no disease; as there is [said to<br>\
be] no disease in the ظبى. (AA, T.) And لَكَ<br>\
عِنْدِى مِائَةٌ سِنَّ الظَّبْىِ [To thee I owe a hundred<br>\
camels of the age of the gazelle], i. e., all of them<br>\
ثُنْيَان [pl. of ثَنِىٌّ, q. v.], because the ظبى does<br>\
not exceed what is termed إِثْنَآءٌ. (M.) [See also<br>\
a verse cited voce سِنٌّ; in which the phrase<br>\
فَجَآءَتْ كَسِنِّ الظَّبْىِ means And they came; like<br>\
the age of the gazelle was the age of every one of<br>\
them.] It is said in a prov., ↓ لَأَتْرُكَنَّهُ تَرْكَ ظُبَىٍّ<br>\
ظِلَّهُ [I will assuredly forsake him as a little gazelle<br>\
forsakes the place of its shade]; because the ظبى,<br>\
when it leaves its covert, does not return to it: it<br>\
is said in confirming the relinquishing of anything.<br>\
(T. [See ظِلٌّ, where other relations of this prov.<br>\
are mentioned.]) And in another prov., الظِّبَآءَ<br>\
عَلَى البَقَرِ, said when the tie of relationship and<br>\
friendship between two men is severed, and it<br>\
was used in the Time of Ignorance as a form of<br>\
divorce: الظباء is in the accus. case by reason of<br>\
اِخْتَرْتُ, or اِخْتَارَ, understood, [so that the meaning<br>\
is I have preferred, or he has preferred, the<br>\
gazelles to the wild cows,] by the بقر being meant<br>\
the women: whence the saying, جَآءَ يَجُرُّ بَقَرَهُ<br>\
[expl. in art. بقر]. (Meyd. [See also Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Prov. ii. 61.]) And one says, أَتَيْتُهُ حِينَ<br>\
شَدَّ الظَّبْىَ ظِلُّهُ i. e. [I came to him when its shade]<br>\
confined the ظبى [or gazelle] by reason of the<br>\
vehemence of the heat: or, as some relate it,<br>\
حِينْ نَشَدَ الظَّبْىُ ظِلَّهُ, meaning طَلَبَهُ [i. e., when<br>\
the gazelle sought its shade]. (TA.) And it is<br>\
said in a trad., إِذَا أَتَيْتَهُمْ فَارْبِضْ فِى دَارِهِمْ ظَبْيًا<br>\
[expl. voce رَبَضَ]. (T, TA.) بِهِ لَا بِظَبْىٍ, (S,<br>\
TA,) or بِهِ لَا بِظَبْىٍ أَعْفَرَ, a prov., meaning May<br>\
this accident befall him, (لِيَنْزِلْ بِهِ هٰذِهِ الحَادِثَةُ,)<br>\
not a white antelope, (Meyd,) is said on an occasion of rejoicing at another&#39;s affliction, (S, Meyd,<br>\
TA,) by way of imprecation, i. e. may God make<br>\
that which has befallen him to cleave to him. (S,<br>\
TA. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 148.])<br>\
