depart, (S, Msb, K,) or remove; and بِهِ ↓ ظَعَنَ<br>\
signifies the same [or he journeyed, &amp;c., with<br>\

8<br>\
اِظَّعَنَتْهُ She rode him, (S, K, TA,) namely,<br>\
a camel: you say, هٰذَا بَعِيرٌ تَظَّعِنُهُ المَرْأَةُ This is a<br>\
camel that the woman rides (S, TA) in her<br>\
journeying, and in the day of her departure.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
ظَعَنٌ: see 1:<br>\
-A2-  and see also ظَاعِنٌ.<br>\
ظُعْنَةٌ A short journey. (TA.)<br>\
ظِعْنَةٌ A state or condition, or a mode or<br>\
manner, of journeying or departing. (TA.)<br>\
ظِعَانٌ A rope with which a هَوْدَج [or woman&#39;s<br>\
camel-vehicle] is bound; (S, K;) or with which<br>\
a load is bound, accord. to the T: and ↓ ظَعُونٌ<br>\
signifies the same. (TA.)<br>\
ظَعُونٌ A camel used for work and for bearing<br>\
burdens: (S, K, TA:) or, as some say, peculiarly,<br>\
[like ظَعِينَةٌ,] a camel that is ridden by a woman.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also ظِعَانٌ.<br>\
ظَعِينَةٌ A هَوْدَج [or woman&#39;s camel-vehicle] (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K, TA) in which is a woman, (TA,)<br>\
or whether there be in it a woman or not:<br>\
(S, Msb, K, TA:) this is [said to be] the primary<br>\
signification: (Mgh:) pl. ظَعَائِنُ and ظُعُنٌ (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K) and ظُعْنٌ (S, K) and [pl. of pauc.]<br>\
أَظْعَانٌ (S, Mgh, K) and pl. pl. ظُعُنَاتٌ. (TA.<br>\
[But see, in what follows, an assertion of AZ<br>\
respecting the pl. ظُعُنٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A woman,<br>\
(ISk, Mgh, Msb, TA;) whether in a هَوْدَج or<br>\
elsewhere; (ISk, TA;) the word being used in<br>\
the sense of مَظْعُونَةٌ [for مَظْعُونٌ بِهَا]; because<br>\
her husband journeys (يَظْعَنُ) with her: (Msb:)<br>\
or a man&#39;s wife; because she journeys with her<br>\
husband: (TA:) or a woman as long as she is in<br>\
the هودج; (S, Msb, K;) when not in it she is<br>\
not thus called: (S:) or this is the primary<br>\
meaning: then it was applied to her though in<br>\
her tent, because she might become مَظْعُونَة [i. e.<br>\
مَظْعُون بِهَا]: (Msb:) it is mostly applied to a<br>\
woman riding [in a هودج]: then, to a هودج<br>\
without a woman: and to a woman without a<br>\
هودج. (TA.) &#39;Amr Ibn-Kulthoom says,<br>\
قِفِى قَبْلَ التَّفَرُّقِ يَا ظَعِينَا<br>\
نُخَبِّرْكِ اليَقِينَ وَتُخْبِرِينَا<br>\
[Pause thou before separation, O woman in the<br>\
camel-vehicle: we will inform thee of the real<br>\
truth respecting our case, and thou shalt inform<br>\
us respecting thy case]: (S:) يَا ظَعِينَا is for يَا<br>\
ظَعِينَةُ. (EM p. 185.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, accord. to Lth,<br>\
A camel that is ridden by women: [like ظَعُونٌ:]<br>\
and applied to signify a woman because she<br>\
rides it: or, accord. to IAmb, a camel upon<br>\
which one journeys: and hence the trad., لَيْسَ<br>\
فِى جَمَلٍ ظَعِينَةٍ صَدَقَةٌ i. e. [There is no poor-rate<br>\
in the case of] the camel upon which one journeys;<br>\
if the phrase be thus: but if it be فِى جَمَلِ ظَعِينَةٍ,<br>\
by the last word is meant a woman: (TA:) AZ<br>\
says, one should not say حُمُولٌ nor ظُعُنٌ except<br>\
as meaning the camels upon which are هَوَادِج,<br>\
whether there be in them women or not. (S.)<br>\
ظَاعِنٌ Journeying, going away, departing, or<br>\
removing: (Msb:) [a traveller:] any one going<br>\
forth on a journey, on pilgrimage, or on a warring and plundering expedition, or journeying<br>\
from one city [or town &amp;c.] to another: contr.<br>\
of خَافِضٌ [and of مُقِيمٌ]: one says, أَظَاعِنٌ أَنْتَ<br>\
أَمْ مُقِيمٌ [Art thou journeying or abiding?]: the<br>\
pl. is ظَاعِنُونَ and ظُعُنٌ, and ↓ ظَعَنٌ is a quasipl. n. syn. with ظَاعِنُونَ. (TA.)<br>\
مِظْعَانٌ, applied to a horse or mare, and to a<br>\
she-camel, Easy in pace. (TA.)<br>\
مَظْعُونٌ Made to journey, go away, depart, or<br>\
remove; originally مَظْعُونٌ بِهِ; the complement<br>\
being suppressed because of frequency of usage.<br>\
