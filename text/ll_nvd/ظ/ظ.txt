ظ<br>\
The seventeenth letter of the alphabet: called ظَآءٌ<br>\
[and ظَا]. (TA.) It is a letter peculiar to the<br>\
Arabic language; and is one of the letters termed<br>\
مَجْهُورَة [or vocal, i. e. pronounced with the voice,<br>\
not with the breath only]; and of the letters<br>\
termed لِثَوِيَّة [or gingival], like ث and ذ. (TA.)<br>\
As it does not exist in the language of the<br>\
Nabathæans, they change it into ط. (IF, TA.)<br>\
[It is substituted for the ت in the measure اِفْتَعَلَ<br>\
and the forms inflected therefrom when immediately following ظ; as in اِظَّلَمَ, for اِظْظَلَمَ, for<br>\
اِظْتَلَمَ:] and it is substituted for ذ; as in تَرَكْتُهُ<br>\
وَقِيذًا and وَقِيظًا; as is related on the authorities<br>\
of ISk and Kr; and as in أَرْضٌ جِلْذَآءٌ and جِلْظَآءٌ,<br>\
as is mentioned in the Nawádir el-Aaráb. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [As a numeral, it denotes Nine hundred.]<br>\
