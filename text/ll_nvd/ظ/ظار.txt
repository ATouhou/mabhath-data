ظَأَرَهَا, (S, Mgh, K,) or ظَأَرَهَا عَلَى وَلَدِ غَيْرِهَا,<br>\
(M,) aor.<br>\
ظَاَ^َ, (M, K,) inf. n. ظَأْرٌ (S, M, K) and<br>\
ظِئْارٌ, (M, K,) He made her (a camel, S, Mgh)<br>\
to incline to, or to affect, a young one not her<br>\
own, (S, M, Mgh, K,) and to suckle it; (M, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ أَظْأَرَهَا, and ↓ ظَآءَرَهَا: (K:) and [it is also<br>\
said that] ظِئَارٌ signifies the making a she-camel to<br>\
incline to, or to affect, and suckle, the young one<br>\
of another, by the application of a غِمَامَة in her<br>\
nose, (S, * K, * TA,) i. e. by stopping her nose, and<br>\
also her eyes, (TA,) and by the insertion of a دُرْجَة<br>\
[q. v.] composed of rags into her vulva, (رَحِم, T,<br>\
TA, or حَيَآء, S), and closing its [i. e. the vulva&#39;s]<br>\
edges by means of two pointed pieces of wood stuck<br>\
through, and putting upon her a غِمَامَة covering<br>\
her head, and leaving her in this state until it<br>\
distresses her, (T, TA,) and she imagines herself<br>\
to be in labour; (TA;) when the درجة is pulled<br>\
out from her vulva (حَيَآء), and the young one of<br>\
another is brought near to her, having its head<br>\
and skin bedaubed with what has come forth with<br>\
the درجة from the lower part of the vulva; (T, *<br>\
TA;) then they open her nose and her eyes; (TA;)<br>\
and when she sees and smells the young one, she<br>\
imagines that she has brought it forth, and yields<br>\
it milk: moreover, when the درجة is inserted, the<br>\
space between the two edges of her vulva is closed<br>\
by a thong [passed round the extremities of the<br>\
two pointed pieces of wood]. (T, TA.) It is said<br>\
in a trad., of &#39;Omar, (T,) or Ibn-&#39;Omar, (S, TA,)<br>\
that he purchased a she-camel, and, seeing in her<br>\
the laceration on the occasion of ظِئْار, returned<br>\
her. (T, S, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ظَأَرَهُ عَلَى أَمْرِ<br>\
كَذَا, and ↓ أَظَأَرَهُ, and ↓ ظَآءَرَهُ, (tropical:)  He made him to<br>\
incline to such a thing: (Lth, T, TA:) and<br>\
ظَأَرَنِى عَلَى الأَمْرِ, (so in the CK,) or ↓ ظَآءَرَنِى<br>\
عَلَيْهِ, (M, TA, and so in some copies of the K,)<br>\
inf. n. مُظَآءَرَةٌ, (TA,) he endeavoured to turn me,<br>\
or to entice me, to do the thing; (M, K, TA;) it<br>\
not being in my mind: (TA:) or he compelled me<br>\
to do the thing, against my will; (K, TA;) I<br>\
having refused to do it. (TA.) It is said in a<br>\
prov., الطَّعْنُ يَظْأَرُ, meaning, Thrusting, or<br>\
piercing, with the spear inclines [one&#39;s enemies]<br>\
to peace: (As, T, A, K:) J says يَظْأَرُهُ, as also<br>\
IKtt, which F disapproves; but others approve<br>\
it: or the reading of the S is ↓ يُظْئِرُهُ. (TA.)<br>\
The Arabs also said, الطَّعْنُ ظِئَارُ قَوْمٍ (M, K)<br>\
Thrusting, or piercing, with the spear is a means<br>\
of inclining a people to peace; (K;) meaning,<br>\
make people to fear, that they may love thee.<br>\
(M, K.) It is also said, in a trad. of &#39;Alee,<br>\
أَظْأَرُكُمْ إِلَى الحَقِّ وَأَنْتُمْ تَفِرُّونَ مِنْهُ, [perhaps a<br>\
mistake for على الحقّ,] I incline you [or I<br>\
endeavour to turn you] to the truth, and ye flee<br>\
from it. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  ظَأَرَتْ, (S, K,) [of which<br>\
ظُؤُورَةٌ, q. v., appears to be an inf. n.; or you say<br>\
ظَأَرَتْ عَلَى وَلَدِ غَيْرِهَا, and عَلَى بَوٍّ;] and ↓ اِظَّأَرَتْ;<br>\
(T, M, K; in one copy of the K اِظْآرَّتْ;) She<br>\
(a camel, T, S, M) inclined to, or affected, a young<br>\
one not her own, (T, M, K,) and suckled it: (K:)<br>\
or inclined to, or affected, the stuffed skin of a<br>\
young camel. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ظَأَرَ عَلَى عَدُوِّهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  He returned against his enemy. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
And ظَأَرَ, aor.<br>\
ظَاَ^َ; (Msb;) or ↓ ظَآءَرَ, inf. n. مُظَآءَرَةٌ.<br>\
(AZ, S;) He took to himself a ظِئْر [or nurse].<br>\
(AZ, S, Msb.) [See also 8.]<br>\
3<br>\

-b2-  One says also,<br>\
ظَآءَرَتْ, (inf. n. مُظَآءَرَةٌ, T, A,) She took to herself<br>\
a child to suckle. (T, M, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And بَيْنَهُمَا<br>\
مُظَآءَرَةٌ There is between them two that relation<br>\
which consists in each one&#39;s being the ظِئْر [or<br>\
rather the fosterer of the child] of the other.<br>\
(M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  ظَاوِرْ occurs in a trad. for ظَائِرْ. (TA.)<br>\
[But in what sense is not explained.]<br>\

-b2-  اِظَّأَرَ لِوَلَدِهِ ظِئْرًا, (S,<br>\
and so in some copies of the K,) or اِظْطَأَرَ, (M,<br>\
and so in some copies of the K,) the former being<br>\
similar to اِظَّلَمَ, (S,) means He took a nurse for<br>\
his child. (S, M, K.)<br>\
10<br>\
استظأرت She (a bitch) desired the male:<br>\
(K:) mentioned by AM; but he says, “I hesitate respecting it. ” (TA.) [I think it is probably<br>\
a mistake for استطارت, mentioned in art. طير.<br>\
See also ظُؤْرَى.]<br>\
ظَأْرٌ Anything accompanied by the like thereof:<br>\
thus applied to a run (عَدْوٌ): (As, T, TA:) in the<br>\
K, and in the Tekmileh, عَدُوٌّ is erroneously put<br>\
for عَدْوٌ: (TA:) and عَدْوٌ ظَأْرٌ is used by the<br>\
poet El-Arkat, in describing [wild] asses, as<br>\
meaning a run not unsparingly performed. (T,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
ظِئْرٌ One that inclines to, or affects, the young<br>\
one of another, and suckles [or fosters] it; applied<br>\

to a male: (M, A, K:) or a she-camel that inclines to, or affects, the young one of another;<br>\
(Msb;) as also ↓ ظَؤُورٌ: (S:) and hence applied<br>\
also to a strange woman that nurses, or fosters,<br>\
the child of another: and likewise to a man who<br>\
fosters the child of another: and also pronounced<br>\
ظِيرٌ, with the ء suppressed: (Msb:) and the epithet ظِئْرَةٌ is also applied to a female: (A:) the<br>\
pl. [of pauc.] is أَظْؤُرٌ (M, K) and أَظْآرٌ, (S, M,<br>\
A, Msb, K,) [which latter is also used as a pl.<br>\
of mult., accord. to an ex. given in the A;] and<br>\
[the proper pls. of mult. are] ظُؤُورٌ and ↓ ظُؤَارٌ,<br>\
(S, M, K,) which last is an extr. form, (M,) and<br>\
↓ ظُؤْرَةٌ, (M, K,) or, accord. to Sb, this is a quasipl. n., (M,) and ظُؤُورَةٌ, (M, K,) like فُحُولَةٌ and<br>\
بُعُولَةٌ: (M:) or the pl., applied to camels, is<br>\
↓ ظُؤَارٌ; and to women, ظُؤُورَةٌ: (M:) or to<br>\
women, ظِئَارٌ and ↓ ظُؤَارٌ: (Msb:) ↓ ظُؤُورَةٌ also<br>\

to the young one, or to the stuffed skin of a young<br>\
one. (M.) ―<br>\

a poet, M, TA) to (tropical:)  The three stones upon which<br>\
the cooking-pot is placed: (S, M, K, TA:) likened<br>\
to camels; (M, TA;) because of their inclining<br>\
(S, M, TA) towards, (S,) or around, (M, TA,)<br>\
the ashes. (S, M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And ظِئْرٌ signifies<br>\
also (tropical:)  An angle, or a corner, of a قَصْر [or pavilion,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A buttress built against a<br>\
wall; (K, * TA;) likewise called ↓ ظِئْرَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\

ظِئَارٌ A غِمَامَة [q. v.] that is put into the nose of<br>\

the young one of another, in order that she may<br>\
not perceive the smell of her young one. (A.)<br>\
[See also 1.]<br>\
ظَؤُورٌ: see ظِئْرٌ, in two places.<br>\
ظُؤُورَةٌ Inclination to, or affection for, the young<br>\
one of another: (M, K:) it may be an inf. n.,<br>\
as well as a pl. [of ظِئْرٌ]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also [The<br>\
relation in which one stands by being a ظِئْر, or<br>\
