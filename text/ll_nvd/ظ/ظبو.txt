load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'ظبوظُبَةٌ The حَدّ, (T, M, Msb, K,) or طَرَف, (S,)<br>\
[both of which mean the end, or extremity, but<br>\
the former means also the edge,] of a sword, (T,<br>\
S, M, Msb, K,) or of a spear-head and the like,<br>\
(K,) or also of a spear-head and of an arrowhead and of a dagger and the like; (M;) or the<br>\
part next to the طَرَف [or extremity] of the sword;<br>\
also called its ذُبَاب: (T:) or the ظُبَتَانِ are the<br>\
parts of the two edges that are on either side of<br>\
the ذُبَاب [by which last word is here app. meant<br>\
the point] of the sword: (AZ, T and TA voce<br>\
ذُبَابٌ, q. v.:) [for the swords of the Arabs, in<br>\
the older times, were generally straight, twoedged, and tapering to a point:] or, accord. to<br>\
Aboo-Riyásh, the ظُبَة of the sword is the part<br>\
that is four digits&#39; measure below, or within,<br>\
(دُونَ,) the ذُبَاب thereof; and is the strikingplace thereof: and it is also its حَدّ; and the<br>\
ظُبَة of the spear-head is likewise its حَدّ: (Ham<br>\
p. 48:) the ة in ظُبَةٌ is a substitute for و, which<br>\
is the final radical, (S, M, Msb, K,) the word<br>\
being originally ظُبَوٌ: (S, TA:) the pl. is أَظْبٍ,<br>\
(S, K,) a pl. of pauc., (S,) and ظُبَاتٌ (T, S, M,<br>\
Msb, K) and ظُبَاةٌ [which is originally ظُبَوَةٌ] (S, *<br>\
TA) and ظُبُونَ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and ظِبُونَ and<br>\
ظُبًا or ظُبًى. (M, K.) In the saying of EsSemow-al Ibn-&#39;Ádiyà,<br>\
تَسِيلُ عَلَى حَدِّ الظُّبَاتِ نُفُوسُنَا<br>\
وَلَيْسَتْ عَلَى غَيْرِ الظُّبَاتِ تَسِيلُ<br>\
[Our bloods flow upon the edge of the ظبات, and<br>\
upon other than the edge of the ظبات they flow<br>\
not], by the ظبات may be meant the swords,<br>\
altogether, or the striking-places of the swords.<br>\
(Ham p. 52. [See also a similar ex. in p. 48 of<br>\
the same.])<br>\
-A2-  Also A kind of مَزَاد [or leathern<br>\
water-bag]. (M.)<br>\
-A3-  And A place of bending,<br>\
or turning, of a valley; like ظَبْيَةٌ [which belongs<br>\
to art. ظبى]: pl. of the former ظُبَآءٌ, a pl. of a<br>\
rare form. (M in art. ظبى.)<br>\
