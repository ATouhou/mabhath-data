شَفَعَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
شَفَعَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. شَفْعٌ, (S, Msb,) He made it to be a شَفْع;<br>\
(S, K, TA;) meaning (TA) he made it (a single<br>\
thing) to be a زَوْج [i. e. he made it to be one of a<br>\
pair or couple; and sometimes, he made it to be a<br>\
pair or couple together]: (Mgh, TA:) or he<br>\
adjoined it to, or coupled it with, that which<br>\
was a single thing: (Msb:) accord. to Er-Rághib,<br>\
الشَّفْعُ signifies the adjoining a thing to its like.<br>\
(TA.) You say, كَانَ وِتْرًا فَشَفَعْتُهُ, (S,) or كَانَ<br>\
وِتْرًا فَشَفَعْتُهُ بِآخَرَ i. e. [It was a single thing, and]<br>\
I made it to be one of a pair, or couple, with<br>\
another. (Mgh. [In Har p. 194, I find the<br>\
phrase بآخر ↓ كان وترا فشفّعه, expl. in like<br>\
manner; but شفّعه thus used I do not find in any<br>\
lexicon: it may, however, be correctly thus used;<br>\
for تشفّع, which has the form, app. has also<br>\
the signification, of its quasi-pass.]) [And شُفِعَ<br>\
المِلْكُ بِمِلْكٍ آخَرَ The possession (here meaning<br>\
house, or piece of land,) was coupled by purchase<br>\
with another possession: and شُفِعَ بِهِ مِلْكٌ It<br>\
had a possession coupled with it by purchase: see<br>\
شُفْعَةٌ.] You say also, شَفَعْتُ الرَّكْعَةَ I made the<br>\
ركعة to be two. (Msb.) And a poet says,<br>\
مَا كَانَ أَبْصَرَنِى بِغِرَّاتِ الصِّبَى<br>\
فَالْيَوْمَ قَدْ شُفِعَتْ لِىَ الْأَشْبَاحُ<br>\
[How clear was my sight with the inadvertencies<br>\
of youth! but to-day, objects have become doubled<br>\
to me]: i. e., I see the object [as] two objects, by<br>\
reason of the weakness and dispersedness of my<br>\
sight. (O, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says of a she-camel, (S, O,) and of a ewe, or she-goat, (O,)<br>\
شَفَعَتْ, (S, O,) inf. n. شَفْعٌ, (S,) meaning She<br>\
became such as is termed شَافِعٌ [q. v.]: (S, O:)<br>\
she is thus termed لِأَنَّ وَلَدَهَا شَفَعَهَا أَوْ شَفَعَتْهُ<br>\
[because her young one has made her to be one of<br>\
a pair, or couple, with itself, or because she has<br>\
made it to be one of a pair or couple, with<br>\
another that is in her belly], (S, O, K,) inf. n.<br>\
شَفْعٌ, or the inf. n. in this case is شِفْعٌ, with kesr.<br>\
(O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  One says also, إِنَّهُ لَيَشْفَعُ عَلَىَّ بِالعَدَاوَةِ,<br>\
(K,) or لِى, (O,) i. e. (tropical:)  Verily he aids [another,<br>\
becoming to him one of a pair, by enmity] against<br>\
me, and acts injuriously to me [conjointly with<br>\
another]. (O, K, TA.) Accord. to Er-Rághib,<br>\
يَشْفَعُ means He joins himself to another, and<br>\
aids him, becoming to him one of a pair, or a<br>\
شَفِيع [i. e. an intercessor], in doing good or evil,<br>\
so that he aids him, or partakes with him, in<br>\
[procuring] the benefit or the harm thereof; and<br>\
thus it means in the saying in the Kur [iv. 87],<br>\
مَنْ يَشْفَعْ شَفَاعَةً حَسَنَةً [and in what follows the<br>\
same]: (TA:) or these words mean Whoso adds<br>\
a [good] deed to a [good] deed: (O, K:) or, as<br>\
some say, the شفاعة here is a man&#39;s instituting,<br>\
or prescribing, to another, a way of good or evil,<br>\
so that he [the latter] imitates him, and thus<br>\
becomes as though he were to him one of a pair.<br>\
(TA.) [But accord. to the expositors in general,<br>\
and accord. to the general usage of the inf. n.<br>\
شَفَاعَةٌ as distinguished from شَفْعٌ, what is here<br>\
meant is Intercession.] ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence also,] شَفَعَ لَهُ<br>\
إِلَى فُلَانٍ, (S, * K, * TA,) or الى الأَمِيرِ, (MA,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
شَفَعَ, (K, TA,) inf. n. شَفَاعَةٌ; (MA, K, TA;)<br>\
and لَهُ ↓ تشفّع, (MA,) or فِيهِ ↓ تشفّع; (S, TA;)<br>\
He made petition, or intercession, for him [to<br>\
such a one, or to the prince or the like; thus<br>\
adjoining himself to him as an aider]: (MA,<br>\
TA:) and شَفَعَ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ [He interceded between<br>\
the people], inf. n. شَفَاعَةٌ: (Jel in iv. 87:) and<br>\
شَفَعْتُ فِى الأَمْرِ, (Msb,) inf. n. شَفَاعَةٌ (IKtt, Msb,<br>\
TA) and شَفْعٌ, (Msb, [but the latter is scarcely to<br>\
be found elsewhere thus used,]) I pleaded, [or<br>\
interceded,] in the affair, or case, [in favour of<br>\
another,] for some means of access or ingratiation,<br>\
or some right or due: (IKtt, * Msb, TA: *) شَفَاعَةٌ<br>\
is mentioned, but not explained, in the K: (TA:)<br>\
as distinguished from شَفْعٌ meaning as expl.<br>\
above, it signifies the joining oneself to another<br>\
as an aider to him or a petitioner respecting him<br>\
[or for him]; and in most instances the former<br>\
person is one of higher station than the latter:<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA:) or the speaking of the شَفِيع<br>\
[or intercessor] to the king [or some other person]<br>\
respecting some object of want which the speaker<br>\
asks for another person: it is also expl. as signifying the passing over without punishment, or the<br>\
forgiving, [or rather the asking, or requesting,<br>\
the passing over &amp;c., (for the word طَلَبُ, probably accidentally omitted by the transcriber at<br>\
the commencement of the explanation, should<br>\
doubtless be supplied,)] of sins, crimes, or misdeeds. (TA.) Hence, in a trad., ↓ اِشْفَعْ تُشَفَّعْ<br>\
[Intercede thou: thou shalt have thine intercession accepted]. (TA.) The saying in the Kur [ii.<br>\
117], وَلَا تَنْفَعُهَا شَفَاعَةٌ [Nor shall intercession<br>\
profit it] means that it shall have no شَافِع [or<br>\
intercessor] for his شَفَاعَة [or intercession] to<br>\
profit it; being a denial of the شَافِع; (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Arafeh, O, K;) and the same is the case in the<br>\
Kur lxxiv. 49, (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, O, TA,) and xx.<br>\
108. (TA.) شَفَعَ, inf. n. شَفْعٌ and شَفَاعَةٌ, also<br>\
signifies He prayed, or supplicated: and thus<br>\
Mbr and Th explain the words of the Kur [ii.<br>\
256], مَنْ ذَا الَّذِى يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ [Who is he<br>\
that shall pray, or supplicate, in his presence,<br>\
except by his permission?]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Accord. to<br>\
El-Kutabee, (Mgh,) [i. e.] El-Kuteybee, (TA,) one<br>\
says also, of a neighbour of one who desires to<br>\
sell a dwelling [or land] شَفَعَ إِلَيْهِ فِى مَا بَاعَ, meaning He made a demand to him, i. e. to the latter,<br>\
respecting that which he sold [for the right of<br>\
pre-emption]: and of the latter person, ↓ فَشَفَّعَهُ<br>\
[and he admitted his right of pre-emption, i. e.]<br>\
and he pronounced him to have a better right, or<br>\
title, or claim, [as a purchaser,] to that which<br>\
was sold, that he whose connexion was more<br>\
remote. (Mgh, TA. *)<br>\
-A2-  شَفَعَ, inf. n. شَفْعٌ, signifies also He, or it, was, or became, tall, or high.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And شُفِعَ, like عُنِىَ, He (a man) was<br>\
smitten by the [evil] eye. (IKtt, TA. [But see<br>\
شُفْعَةٌ, last sentence.])<br>\
2<br>\
شَفَّعَ see 1, near the beginning. ―<br>\
-b2-  شَفَّعْتُهُ فِيهِ,<br>\
inf. n. تَشْفِيعٌ, I accepted his intercession (شَفَاعَتَهُ)<br>\
[for him]. (S, * O, K.) See, again, 1, in the last<br>\
quarter of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b3-  And see another signification of the verb in a later part of the same<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
5<br>\
تشفّع [signifies It was made a pair or<br>\
couple, accord. to the K voce وِتْرٌ; this word<br>\
being there expl. as meaning مَا لَمْ يَتَشَفَّعْ مِنَ العَدَدِ:<br>\
but in the M and A, in the same place, instead of<br>\
يَتَشَفَّعْ, we find يُشْفَعْ]. ―<br>\
-b2-  تشفّع لَهُ, and فِيهِ: see 1,<br>\
near the middle of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b3-  [It is said<br>\
in the TA that تَشَفَّعَهُ also is quasi-pass. of<br>\
اِسْتَشْفَعَ بِهِ: but تَشَفَّعَهُ is evidently, here, a mistranscription, app. for تَشَفَّعَ, meaning He was<br>\
granted intercession.]<br>\
-A2-  Also He became a<br>\
شَافِعِىّ [i. e. a follower of the Imám Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee]<br>\
in persuasion: but this is post-classical. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
اِسْتَشْفَعْتُهُ إِلَى فُلَانٍ I asked him to make<br>\
intercession for me (أَنْ يَشْفَعَ لِى) to such a one.<br>\
(S, O, K. *) And اِسْتَشْفَعْتُ بِهِ I sought, or demanded, intercession (الشَّفَاعَةَ) [by means of him].<br>\
(Msb.) A poet, cited by Aboo-Leylà, says,<br>\
زَعَمَتْ مَعَاشِرُ أَنَّنِى مُسْتَشْفِعٌ<br>\
لَمَّا خَرَجْتُ أَزُورُهُ أَقْلَامَهَا<br>\
i. e. Companies of men asserted me to be seeking<br>\
intercession (زَعَمُوا أَنِى أَسْتَشْفِعُ) for the object of<br>\
eulogy, [when I went forth repairing to visit<br>\
him,] by means of their writing-reeds (بِأَقْلَامِهِمْ),<br>\
meaning by their letters (بِكُتُبِهِمْ). (O, TA.)<br>\
شَفْعٌ contr. of وِتْرٌ; (S, Mgh, O, K;) i. q. زَوْجٌ<br>\
[i. e., like زَوْجٌ, it signifies One of a pair or<br>\
couple; and sometimes, but rarely, a pair or<br>\
couple together; and sometimes, (see for instance<br>\
زَكَا) an even number, a number that may be<br>\
divided into two equal numbers]: (O, K:) also<br>\
one with which another is made to be a pair or<br>\
couple: (TA:) [and, as will be seen in what<br>\
follows, one with which an odd number is made<br>\
to be an even number:] pl. شِفَاعٌ, (TA,) and app.<br>\
أَشْفَاعٌ, whence الصَّلَاةُ بَيْنَ الأَشْفَاعِ, meaning<br>\
التَّرَاوِيح [q. v. voce تَرْوِيحَةٌ]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الشَّفْعُ<br>\
also signifies The day of the sacrifice; (O, K;)<br>\
thus in the words of the Kur [lxxxix. 2] وَالشَّفْعِ<br>\
وَالْوِتْرِ; by الوتر being meant the day of &#39;Arafát:<br>\
(O:) or in this instance it means the creatures of<br>\
God, (O, K,) because of the saying in the Kur<br>\
[li. 49], “and of everything we have created two<br>\
of a pair; ” (K;) الوتر meaning God: (O, K:) or<br>\
Adam&#39;s wife; الوتر meaning Adam, who was<br>\
made a pair with her: (I&#39;Ab, O, TA:) or Adam&#39;s<br>\
children: (TA:) or the two days after the sacrifice; الوتر meaning the third day: (O, TA:) or<br>\
God; [and الوتر, those who compose an odd<br>\
number;] because of the saying in the Kur [lviii.<br>\
8], “there can be no secret discourse of three,<br>\
but He is the maker of them, with Himself, to<br>\
be four: ” (K:) or the meaning of الشَّفْعُ وَالوِتْرُ is<br>\
the prayers; of which some are شَفْع [i. e. an even<br>\
number of rek&#39;ahs], and some are وِتْر [i. e. an odd<br>\
number of rek&#39;ahs]: (O, TA:) [for] it is said that<br>\
all the numbers consist of شَفْع [i. e. even] and وِتْر<br>\
[i. e. odd]. (TA.)<br>\
شَفْعَةٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places,<br>\
near the end.<br>\
شُفْعَةٌ is used in relation to a house and to land;<br>\
(S, TA;) and ↓ شُفُعَةٌ, with two dammehs, is a<br>\
dial. var. thereof thus used. (TA.) It signifies<br>\
A مِلْك [here meaning house, or piece of land,]<br>\
that is coupled (مَشْفُوع) [by purchase] with one&#39;s<br>\
مِلْك [i. e. house, or piece of land, previously<br>\
possessed, and adjoining thereto]; (Mgh, Msb; *)<br>\
from the phrase كَانَ وِتْرًا فَشَفَعْتُهُ [expl. above, in<br>\
the second sentence of this art.]; (Mgh; [and the<br>\
like is said in the Msb;]) a noun of the same<br>\
class as لُقْمَةٌ; being of the measure فُعْلَةٌ in the<br>\
sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (Mgh, Msb: *) this<br>\
is the primary signification: then it was applied<br>\
to denote a particular kind of obtaining possession; (Mgh;) [i. e.] it is also used as meaning the<br>\
obtaining possession of that مِلْك [or house, or<br>\
piece of land, by purchasing it, and coupling it<br>\
with that previously possessed, and adjoining<br>\
thereto]; (Msb;) or one&#39;s making a demand<br>\
respecting that which he seeks [to possess, for the<br>\
right of the pre-emption thereof], and adjoining<br>\
it to that which he [already] has: (O, K:) and<br>\
with the lawyers it signifies the right of obtaining<br>\
possession of a piece of land, [i. e. the right of<br>\
pre-emption thereof, or of a house,] against one&#39;s<br>\
co-sharer whose possession is recent, by compulsion, for a compensation: (K:) or the right of<br>\
obtaining possession of a piece of land, by compulsion, for [the payment of] what it cost the<br>\
[former] purchaser, by reason of partnership or<br>\
of [immediate] neighbourship: (KT:) or the<br>\
right of [immediate] neighbourship with respect<br>\
to [pre-emption of] a house or land. (PS.) [See<br>\
1 in art. سقب.] El-Kutabee says, in explaining<br>\
this word, in the Time of Ignorance, when a man<br>\
desired to sell a house, his neighbour used to<br>\
come to him and to make a demand to him (شَفَعَ<br>\
إِلَيْهِ i. e. طَلَبَ) respecting that which he sold [for<br>\
the right of pre-emption], and he pronounced<br>\
him to have a better right, or title, or claim, [as a<br>\
purchaser,] to that which was sold, than he whose<br>\
connexion was more remote: as though he took<br>\
it from الشَّفَاعَةُ: but the [right] derivation is that<br>\
first mentioned. (Mgh.) We have not heard,<br>\
(Mgh,) or there is not known, (Msb,) any verb<br>\
belonging to it [in the classical language]. (Mgh,<br>\
Msb.) Esh-Shaabee uses it in the first and in the<br>\
second of the senses expl. above, [or nearly so,]<br>\
in his saying, مَنْ بِيعَتْ شُفْعَتُهُ وَهُوَ حَاضِرٌ فَلَمْ<br>\
يَطْلُبْ ذٰلِكَ فَلَا شُفْعَةَ لَهُ [i. e. He whose claimed<br>\
possession to be coupled by purchase with one<br>\
already belonging to him is sold when he is present<br>\
without his demanding that possession, there shall<br>\
be no obtaining possession for him by his purchasing it for that purpose]. (Mgh. [And the<br>\
like is said in the Msb.]) Esh-Shaabee says<br>\
[also], الشُّفْعَةُ عَلَى رُؤُوسِ الرِجَالِ [The possession<br>\
that is coupled by purchase with another possession is apportioned according to the heads of the<br>\
men entitled thereto]: i. e., when the house is<br>\
shared by a company of men whose shares are<br>\
different, and one of them sells his portion, what<br>\
is sold to his co-sharers is to be apportioned among<br>\
them equally, according to their heads, not according to their [former] shares: (O, K, TA:)<br>\
so in the Nh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شُفْعَةُ الضُّحَى The two<br>\
rek&#39;ahs (رَكْعَتَانِ) of the [prayer that is performed in the period of the morning called the]<br>\
ضُحَى; as also الضحى ↓ شَفْعَةُ: (O, K:) occurring<br>\
in a trad., thus accord. to two different relations.<br>\
(O.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Diabolical, or demoniacal, possession; or madness, or insanity; (AA, O, K;) and<br>\
so ↓ شَفْعَةٌ; the latter expl. in this sense by IAar;<br>\
and as syn. with سَفْعَةٌ and شُنْعَةٌ and رَدَّةٌ and نَظْرَةٌ,<br>\
[perceived] in the face: [see these words; the<br>\
second and third of which generally mean an<br>\
unseemliness or ugliness; and so, sometimes, does<br>\
the last:] the pl. of شُفْعَةٌ in the sense here expl.<br>\
on the authority of AA is شُفَعٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
IF states that it has been said to signify The<br>\
[evil] eye, by which one is smitten: but he doubts<br>\
its correctness; and thinks that it may be with<br>\
the unpointed س. (O.) [See سَفْعَةٌ, not سُفْعَةٌ.]<br>\
شُفُعَةٌ: see شُفْعَةٌ, first sentence.<br>\
شَفُوعٌ A she-camel that fills two milking-vessels<br>\
in one milking. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also شَافِعٌ.<br>\
شَفِيعٌ i. q. صَاحِبُ شَفَاعَةٍ; (S, K, TA;) i. e.<br>\
(TA) An intercessor; as also ↓ شَافِعٌ: pl. of the<br>\
former شُفَعَآءُ. (Msb, TA.) [See السُّقَفَآء, in art.<br>\
سقف.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q. صَاحِبُ شُفْعَةٍ; (S, K;) [meaning A possessor of the right termed شُفْعَة; or]<br>\
one who demands, and is granted, as a neighbour<br>\
[or a partner], in preference to him whose connexion is more remote, the right of purchasing<br>\
a house [or piece of land] that is to be sold.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
شَفَائِعُ Sorts of pasture, or herbage, that grow<br>\
two and two: (Ibn-Abbád, O, K:) or twins<br>\
(تُؤَام [pl. of تَوْءَم]) of plants. (O, K.)<br>\
شَافِعٌ [act. part. n. of 1, q. v. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence], applied<br>\
to a she-camel, (tropical:)  Having a young one in her<br>\
belly and another following her: (Fr, Sh, S, Mgh,<br>\
K, TA:) or applied in this sense to a ewe or she-goat: (K:) or, thus applied, having her young one<br>\
with her: (A&#39;Obeyd, S, Mgh:) thus called because<br>\
her young one has made her to be one of a pair<br>\
[with it], or because she has made it to be one of<br>\
a pair [with her]: (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K:) and ↓ شَفُوعٌ,<br>\
thus applied, signifies the same as شَافِعٌ: and one<br>\
says also, هٰذِهِ شَاةُ الشَّافِعِ, like as one says صَلَاةُ<br>\
الأُولَى and مَسْجِدُ الجَامِعِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A<br>\
he-goat, (O, K, TA,) himself: (O:) or a ram:<br>\
or such as, when he impregnates, impregnates<br>\
with twins. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عَيْنٌ شَافِعَةٌ An eye [that<br>\
makes a thing to appear a pair, i. e.,] that sees<br>\
doubly. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  فُلَانٌ يُعَادِينِى وَلَهُ شَافِعٌ means<br>\
(tropical:)  Such a one treats me with enmity, and has one<br>\
who aids him to do so. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See also<br>\
شَفِيعٌ and مُشَفَّعٌ.<br>\
أَشْفَعُ Tall, or high. (L, TA.)<br>\
مُشْفِعٌ A ewe, or she-goat, that suckles any<br>\
animal. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
مُشَفَّعٌ One whose intercession is accepted:<br>\
hence the Kur-án is termed by Ibn-Mes&#39;ood<br>\
مُشَفَّعٌ ↓ شَافِعٌ, i. e. An intercessor of which the<br>\
intercession will be accepted, for him who follows<br>\
it and does according to what is in it, that his<br>\
unpremeditated transgressions may be forgiven.<br>\
(O, TA.)<br>\
مُشَفِعٌ One who accepts intercession. (L, TA.)<br>\
مَشْفُوعٌ A possession (مِلْكٌ [here meaning house,<br>\
or piece of land,]) coupled [by purchase] with a<br>\
man&#39;s possession [previously belonging to him,<br>\
upon certain conditions expl. voce شُفْعَةٌ]. (Mgh,<br>\
Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Affected with diabolical, or demoniacal, possession; or with madness, or insanity;<br>\
(O, K;) and مَسْفُوعٌ, with the unpointed س, is a<br>\
dial. var. thereof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And مَشْفُوعَةٌ is said<br>\
to signify A woman smitten by the [evil] eye:<br>\
(IF, O, L: [but see شُفْعَةٌ, last sentence:]) the<br>\
masc. is not used in this sense. (L, TA.)<br>\
' } );
