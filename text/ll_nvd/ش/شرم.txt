شَرَمَهُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
شَرِمَ, (K,) inf. n. شَرْمٌ, i. q.<br>\
شَقَّهُ [meaning He slit it; or rent it; and perhaps<br>\
also he clave it, split it, &amp;c.]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is<br>\
also said in the K that الشَّرْمُ signifies قَطْعُ مَا بَيْنَ<br>\
الأَرْنَبَةِ: but ما بين should be struck out: and the<br>\
passage, moreover, is defective: it should be, as<br>\
in the M, الشَّرْمُ and ↓ التَّشْرِيمُ signify The cutting<br>\
(قَطْع [or rather شَقّ i. e. slitting or rending]) of<br>\
the end, or tip, of the nose, and of the ثَفْر [here<br>\
meaning the vulva, or the orifice of the vagina,]<br>\

(TA. [See also 2; and see شَرِيمٌ.]) ―<br>\

aor. and inf. n. as above, and the latter, by poetic<br>\
license, شَرَمٌ, He ate of the sides, or of the edge,<br>\

with broth]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  شَرَمَ لَهُ مِنْ مَالِهِ, (S, K,)<br>\
aor. as above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (TA,) He<br>\
gave him little of his مال (i. e. property, or cattle]. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  شَرِمَ, aor.<br>\
شَرَمَ, is quasi-pass. of شَرَمَهُ;<br>\
[i. e. it signifies It was, or became, slit, or rent;]<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ انشرم. (S, TA. [In the former<br>\
it is implied that the meaning of the latter verb is<br>\
اِنْشَقَّ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, aor. as above, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
شَرَمٌ, (S, * Msb, K, *) He (a man) had his nose<br>\

for the purpose of] the making a she-camel to<br>\
affect and suckle a young one not her own [by<br>\
causing her to imagine, from the pain thus occasioned, that she has recently brought forth that<br>\
young one]; (TA;) تشريم in this phrase signifying<br>\
تَشْقِيق. (T in art. ظأر.) It is said in a trad. of<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Omar, that he purchased a she-camel, and,<br>\
seeing in her what is thus termed, returned her:<br>\
(S:) in this instance, تشريم الظئار means The<br>\
laceration of the two edges of the vulva on the<br>\
occasion of ظئار. (T and TA in art. ظأر: see 1 in<br>\
that art.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تَشْرِيمُ الصَّيْدِ is The wounding of the<br>\
skin of the animal of the chase without piercing<br>\

fathomless deep,] of the بَحْر [or sea]: (K:) or<br>\
the deepest part thereof: (TA:) or a غَمْرَة [or<br>\

-b2-  And Any fissure in a mountain or rock, not<br>\

شَرِيمٌ A woman having her vagina and rectum<br>\
united by the rending of the separation between<br>\
them; syn. مُفْضَاةٌ; (S, Mgh, K;) as also ↓ شَرُومٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) and ↓ شَرْمَآءُ; (K;) or the last of these in<br>\
this sense has not been heard, though mentioned<br>\
in the sense here following. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
she-camel having her ثَفْر [here meaning the vulva,<br>\
or the orifice of the vagina,] cut [or rather slit<br>\
or rent]; and so ↓ شَرْمَآءُ, and ↓ مَشْرُومَةٌ: (M, TA:)<br>\
or ↓ شَرْمَآءُ applied to a she-camel and to a she-ass,<br>\
accord. to the Tekmileh, means having the vulva<br>\
slit, or rent: therefore the first-mentioned meaning of this epithet, applied to a woman, if correct,<br>\
may be tropical. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The فَرْج [or<br>\
vulva]; (K;) because of its being cleft. (TA.)<br>\

(IAar, TA:) fem. شَرْمَآءُ, applied to a woman.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  For the fem., see also شَرِيمٌ, in three<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b3-  The fem. is also applied to an ear<br>\
(أُذُنٌ), meaning Having a small portion cut from<br>\
the upper part; and so ↓ مُشَرَّمَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
مُشَرَّمٌ Slit, or rent, in several places: so in a<br>\
