to signify] the imposition of a thing as obligatory<br>\
[upon a person], and the taking it upon oneself as<br>\
such, in a sale and the like; (K;) [but this is a<br>\
loose explanation, as is observed in the TK; the<br>\
meaning being a thing imposed upon a person as<br>\
obligatory, and taken upon oneself as such: in the<br>\
S, it is merely said to be well known:] and<br>\
↓ شَرِيطَةٌ signifies the same: (S, Msb, K:) pl. of<br>\
the former, شُرُوطٌ: (S, Msb, K:) and of the latter,<br>\
شَرَائِطُ. (Msb, TA.) It is said in a trad., لَا يَجُوزُ<br>\
شَرْطَانِ فِى بَيْعٍ [Two conditions in a sale are not<br>\
allowable]; as when one says, “I sell to thee this<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth, for ready money for a<br>\
deenár, and on credit for two deenárs. ” (TA.)<br>\
And it is said in a prov., الشَّرْطُ أَمْلَكُ عَلَيْكَ أَمْ لَكَ<br>\
(TA) The condition is most valid, or binding,<br>\
[whether it be against thee or in thy favour:]<br>\
(Mgh in art. ملك:) relating to the keeping of<br>\
conditions between brothers. (Sgh, TA.) [شَرْطٌ<br>\
also relates to other things beside sales and the<br>\
like: for instance, you say, شَرْطُ المَصْدَرِ كَذَا وَكَذَا,<br>\
meaning What is required to justify the application of the term مصدر is such a thing, and such a<br>\
thing.]<br>\
-A2-  شَرْطَا نَهْرٍ The two banks of a river.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [The pl.] شُرُوطٌ also signifies Roads<br>\
leading in different directions. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also<br>\
شَرَطٌ, in two places.<br>\
شَرَطٌ A sign, token, or mark, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
which men appoint between them; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ شَرْطٌ: (TA:) pl. of the former, أَشْرَاطٌ. (Msb,<br>\
K.) And hence, (Msb,) أَشْرَاطُ السَّاعَةِ The signs<br>\
of the resurrection, or of the time thereof; (S,<br>\
Msb, TA;) mentioned in the Kur [xlvii. 20]: or<br>\
the small events prior thereto, which men deny:<br>\
(El-Khattábee:) or the means thereof, exclusive<br>\
of the main circumstances thereof, and of the<br>\
event itself. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence also,] الشَّرَطَانِ The<br>\
two stars [a and b] which are the two horns of<br>\
Aries; (S, K, Kzw;) the brighter whereof is<br>\
called النَّاطِحُ; (Kzw;) [and the other, النَّطْحُ;]<br>\
the First Mansion of the Moon: (Kzw:) to-<br>\
wards the north of them is a small star which<br>\
some of the Arabs reckon with those two, saying<br>\
that it (namely this mansion, K) consists of three<br>\
stars, and calling them الأَشْرَاطُ: (S, K:) IAar<br>\
mentions an instance of the use of the sing.,<br>\
الشَّرَطُ; but the dual is more approved, and more<br>\
commonly known: (TA:) the two stars above<br>\
mentioned are the first asterism of the spring.<br>\
(ISd, Z.) [See مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل.] Hassán<br>\
Ibn-Thábit says,<br>\
فِى نَدَامَى بِيضِ الوُجُوهِ كِرَامٍ<br>\
نُبِّهُوا بَعْدَ هَجْعَةِ الأَشْرَاطِ<br>\
meaning [Among fair-faced, generous cup-companions, roused from sleep after] the setting of<br>\
the اشراط: though another meaning, which see<br>\
below, has been assigned to the last word. (Sgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, (ISd, Z,) شَرَطٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
beginning of a thing; (ISd, * Z, * K;) as also<br>\
↓ مِشْرَاطٌ: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K:) pl. of the former,<br>\
أَشْرَاطٌ, which is applied to the beginnings of any<br>\
event that happens because the شَرَطَان are the<br>\
first asterism of the spring: (ISd, Z:) the pl. of<br>\
↓ مشراط in the sense here expl. is مَشَارِيطُ. (K.)<br>\
Hence, accord. to some, أَشْرَاطُ السَّاعَةِ, expl. above.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  The refuse, (S, Msb, K, TA,) such as<br>\
the galled in the back, and the emaciated, (TA,)<br>\
and the young, (K,) and the bad, (A&#39;Obeyd,) of<br>\
camels or the like, (S, K,) or of goats, (Msb,) or<br>\
of goats also: (S:) used alike as sing. and pl. and<br>\
masc. and fem.: and applied particularly to the<br>\
young of camels, as a pl. and as a sing.: also, to<br>\
a she-camel and to a he-camel: and to such, of<br>\
camels, as is brought, or driven, from one place<br>\
to another for sale; as the aged she-camel, and the<br>\
camel that is galled in the back: (TA:) also the<br>\
same, not ↓ شَرْطٌ as in the K, [without restriction<br>\
of its application,] low, base, vile, or mean; (K, *<br>\
TA;) and so ↓ أَشْرَطُ: (TA:) pl. أَشْرَاطٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
and pl. pl. أَشَارِيطُ. (S,* TA.) You say, الغَنَمُ<br>\
أَشْرَاطُ المَالِ [Sheep, or goats, are the refuse, or<br>\
meanest sort, of beasts that people possess]. (S.)<br>\
And شَرَطٌ is also applied to men; (S, TA;) شَرَطُ<br>\
النَّاسِ signifying The refuse, or lowest or basest or<br>\
meanest sort, pf mankind or people. (TA.) In<br>\
the verse of Hassán Ibn-Thábit cited above,<br>\
الأَشْرَاط is said to mean The guards, or watchmen,<br>\
and the lowest or basest or meanest sort of people;<br>\
(S, Sgh;) [so that هَجْعَة must be understood in<br>\
the sense of “ a light sleep in the first part of the<br>\
night; ”] but the correct meaning is that expl.<br>\
before. (Sgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also أَشْرَاطٌ, The noble, eminent,<br>\
or honourable, sort of men: thus the word has<br>\
two contr. significations. (Yaakoob, S, K.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
And A small water-course coming from a space<br>\
of ten cubits: (AHn, O, K:) or what flows from<br>\
even tracts of ground into the [larger water-courses called] شِعَاب. (TA.)<br>\
شَرْطَةٌ A single act of scarifying; a scarification. (Msb.)<br>\
شُرْطَةٌ A thing which one has made a condition.<br>\
(Sgh, K.) You say, خُذْ شُرْطَتَكَ Take thou that<br>\
which thou hast made a condition. (Sgh, K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also, and ↓ شُرَطَةٌ, (Mgh,) or شُرَطٌ, (K,) which is<br>\
the pl. (Mgh, K) of the former, (K,) The choice<br>\
men of the army: (Mgh:) and such as compose<br>\
the first portion of the army that is present in the<br>\
war or fight, (Mgh, K,) and prepare for death;<br>\
(K;) [the braves of an army;] they are the<br>\
Sultán&#39;s choice men of the army; and the term<br>\
شُرْطَةٌ is applied in a trad. to a party making it a<br>\
condition to die, and not return, unless victorious:<br>\
(TA:) or this appellation, and ↓ شُرَطَةٌ, which is a<br>\
rare form, are applied to a body of soldiers; and<br>\
the pl. is شُرَطٌ: and the pl. is applied to the aids<br>\
(أَعْوَان [here app. meaning guards]) of the Sul-<br>\
tán: (Msb:) شُرْطَةٌ, also, is applied to a wellknown body of the aids (أَعْوَان [here meaning<br>\
armed attendants, officers, or soldiers,]) of the<br>\
prefects [of the police]; (K;) pl. شُرَطٌ: (TA:) the<br>\
شُرَط, (As, S, Msb,) or the شُرْطَة, (K,) are so<br>\
called because they assumed to themselves signs,<br>\
or marks, whereby they might be known (As,<br>\
S, Msb, K) to the enemies: (Msb:) or the شُرَط<br>\
are so called because they were prepared: (AO,<br>\
S:) or as being likened to the شَرَط, or “ refuse,”<br>\
of goats; because they were low persons: (Msb:)<br>\
[or, probably, because they were prepared, or exposed, to be slain:] a single person of the شُرَط is<br>\
called شُرْطَةٌ (S, Msb) and ↓ شُرَطِىٌّ: (S:) or<br>\
↓ شُرْطِىٌّ and ↓ شُرْطِىٌّ are applied to a single person<br>\
of the شُرْطَة: (K:) ↓ شُرْطِىٌّ is a rel. n. from شُرْطَةٌ;<br>\
and such also is ↓ شُرَطِىٌّ from شُرَطَةٌ; not from<br>\
شُرَطٌ, because this is a pl. (Mgh.) صَاحِبُ الشُّرْطَةِ<br>\
signifies The governor, or prefect, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
[of the police, or] of a town, or city, or district,<br>\
or province; to whom formerly pertained both<br>\
religious and civil affairs; but now it is not so.<br>\
(Mgh. [See رِدْفٌ.]) [In later times, this title<br>\
has been commonly applied to The chief, or<br>\
prefect, of the police.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The best, best part,<br>\
or choice, of anything; as also ↓ شَرِيطَةٌ: the latter<br>\
occurring in a trad., as related by Sh; but Az<br>\
thinks it should be the former word. (TA.)<br>\
شُرَطَةٌ: see شُرْطَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
شَرَطِىٌّ Of, or relating to, [the asterism called]<br>\
the شَرَطَان and the أَشْرَاط; as also ↓ أَشْرَاطِىٌّ; the<br>\
latter being formed from the pl., (IB, TA,)<br>\
because the stars thus called are regarded as<br>\
composing one thing. (TA.) You say, رَوْضَةٌ<br>\
↓ أَشْرَاطِيَّةٌ, meaning [A garden, or meadow, &amp;c.,]<br>\
rained upon by the نَوْء [q. v.] of the شَرَطَان. (S.<br>\
TA.) In the A we find ↓ نَوْءٌ شِرَاطِىٌّ: but probably it should be شَرَطِىٌّ. (TA.)<br>\
شُرْطِىٌّ and شُرَطِىٌّ: see شُرْطَةٌ, in five places.<br>\
شَرِيطٌ A rope, or cord, of twisted palm-leaves:<br>\
(S, Msb:) and threads of wool and of fibres of<br>\
the palm-tree [twisted together]: (TA:) or palmleaves twisted together, with which is woven<br>\
(يُشْرَطُ, as in the K, or, as in the O, accord. to the<br>\
TA, يُشْرَحُ, [app. a mistake for يُشْرَجُ,]) a couch, or<br>\
bier, [app. meaning the part thereof upon which<br>\
a man or corpse lies,] and the like: (O, K:) so<br>\
called because its palm-leaves are split, and then<br>\
twisted together: if of fibres of the palm-tree, it is<br>\
called دِسَارٌ: (TA:) or a wide rope [or flat plait]<br>\
woven of fibres or leaves of the palm-tree: (Mgh<br>\
in art. قمط:) or a rope of any kind: pl. شَرَائِطُ<br>\
and شُرُطٌ. (TA.) Also Threads of silk, or of silk<br>\
and of gold, twisted together [or woven, so as to form<br>\
a kind of flat lace, like tape]: so called as being<br>\
likened to the threads of wool and of fibres of the<br>\
palm-tree [twisted together]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The<br>\
[sort of basket, or small box, called] عَتِيدَة in<br>\
which a woman puts her perfumes (IAar, O, K)<br>\
and her utensils or apparatus. (IAar, O.) And<br>\
The [sort of receptacle called] عَيْبَة [q. v.].<br>\

slit: (K, TA:) of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ in the sense<br>\
of the measure مَفْعُولَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\

or goat having a slight scar made upon its throat,<br>\
like the scarification of the cupper, without the<br>\
severing of the [veins called] أَوْدَاج, and without<br>\
making the blood to flow copiously: thus they<br>\
used to do in the Time of Ignorance, cutting a<br>\
little of the animal&#39;s throat, (K, TA,) and then<br>\
leaving it to die; (TA;) and they considered it a<br>\
lawful mode of slaughtering it; but the eating of<br>\
such an animal is forbidden in a trad.: (K, TA:)<br>\
or one scarified on account of some disease; and<br>\
when such died, they said that they had slaughtered it. (TA.)<br>\
شِرَاطِىٌّ: see شَرَطِىٌّ.<br>\
شِرْوَاطٌ, applied to a man, Tall: (O, K:) and,<br>\
applied to a camel, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,) or to a hecamel, (Kudot;,) swift: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K:) or it is<br>\
applied in the former sense to a man, and is also<br>\
applied to a camel, male and female alike, (&#39;Eyn,<br>\
S,) as meaning tall and slender: (&#39;Eyn:) or it<br>\
means tall, spare of flesh, slender; applied to a<br>\
man and to a camel, and to the female likewise,<br>\
without ة. (L.)<br>\
الغَنَمُ أَشْرَطُ المَالِ Sheep, or goats, are the vilest<br>\
sort of beasts that one possesses: an instance of a<br>\
noun of superiority without a verb; which is<br>\
extr.: (K, TA:) this is from the “ Isláh el-Alfádh ” of ISk: but in some of the copies of that<br>\
work, we find أَشْرَاط in the place of أَشْرَط. (ISd,<br>\
