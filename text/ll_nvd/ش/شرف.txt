him high, elevated, exalted, or eminent, [in rank,<br>\
condition, or estimation; or ennobled him:] (S,<br>\

honour. (TA.) [And Golius explains it as meaning He decked with a royal garment; on the<br>\
authority of the KL; in my copy of which I find<br>\

-b3-  شرّف المَرْبَأَ, expl. in the K as<br>\

[q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  شرّف النَّاقَةَ, inf. n. as above,<br>\
means He almost severed the teats of the she-camel by binding them [tightly] with the صِرَار<br>\

S and K in the beginning of art. بلغ, he was, or<br>\
became, at the point of reaching it, or attaining<br>\
it, namely, a place,] or of obtaining it, or getting<br>\
possession of it: [and he was, or became, at the<br>\
point of experiencing it, (See Bd in lxxviii. 14,)<br>\

عَلَوْتُهُ [An eminence rose into view to me, and I<br>\
ceased not to urge on my beast until I ascended,<br>\

acquainted with it; or knew it: all of which<br>\
meanings may be intended to be conveyed by the<br>\
explanation in the Msb, which is اِطَّلَعْتُ عَلَيْهِ:]<br>\
and الشَّىْءَ ↓ شَارَفْتُ signifies the same as أَشْرَفْتُ عَلَيْهِ<br>\

His soul was vehemently eager for a thing.<br>\

لَمْ يُبَارَكْ لَهُ فِيهَا [Whoso takes the enjoyments of the<br>\

solicitous affection or pity or compassion. (O, *<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [And اشرف لِى He, or it, came within<br>\

-b7-  And [hence,] اشرف لَكَ<br>\
الشَّىْءُ The thing became, or has become, within<br>\

مُشَارَفَةٌ; (TA;) He (a man, S, O) ascended, or<br>\
mounted, upon the elevated place of observation.<br>\

اشترف He, or it, stood up, or upright, or<br>\
erect; (S, O, TA;) and (TA) so ↓ استشرف [if this<br>\
be not a mistranscription, which I incline to think<br>\
it may be as the former verb (of which see the<br>\
part. n. below) is not mentioned in the K]. (K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استشرف الشَّىْءَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and لِلشَّىْءِ,<br>\
(Msb in art. طمح,) He raised his eyes (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K) towards the thing, (O, K,) or to look at<br>\
the thing, (Msb,) or looking at the thing, (S,)<br>\
and expanded his hand over his eyebrow like as<br>\
does he who shades [his eyes] from the sun. (S,<br>\
O, K.) A poet says,<br>\
تَطَالَلْتُ وَاسْتَشْرَفْتُهُ فَرَأَيْتُهُ<br>\
فَقُلْتُ لَهُ آأَنْتَ زَيْدُ الأَرَامِلِ<br>\
[I stretched up myself, and raised my eyes<br>\
towards him, expanding my hand over my eyebrow like him who is shading his eyes from the<br>\
sun; and I said to him, Art thou Zeyd-el-Arámil?]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) أُمِرْنَا أَنْ<br>\
نَسْتَشْرِفَ العَيْنَ وَالأُذُنَ, (Mgh, * O, K, TA,) in a<br>\
trad. (O, TA) relating to the sheep or goat to be<br>\

or, (Mgh, O,) as some say, (O,) [in the K “ that<br>\
is,”] to seek that they be of high estimation, by<br>\
being perfect (Mgh, * O, K) and sound: (Mgh,<br>\
O:) or, accord. to some, it is from الشُّرْفَةُ signifying “ the choice ones,” or “ best,” of cattle; and<br>\

them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And يَسْتَشْرِفُ مَعَالِىَ الأُمُورِ (tropical:)  He<br>\

or an honour]; (O, K;) and أَرَى ذٰلِكَ شُرْفَةً [I<br>\
regard that as a favour, and a glory or an<br>\
honour]: (O:) the pl. of شَرَفٌ is أَشْرَافٌ, like as<br>\

highest portions of a قَصْر; but what are thus<br>\
termed are only what are built on the top of a<br>\
wall, distinct from one another, [side by side, like<br>\
merlons of a parapet,] according to a well-known<br>\
form: (TA:) the شُرْفَة is what is called by the<br>\
[common] people ↓ شُرَّافَة: (Ham p. 824:) the<br>\
شُرَّافَة of a mosque is a word used by the lawyers,<br>\

شُرَفَآءُ (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ شَرَفٌ, so in the K, app.<br>\
denoting that this last is one of the pls. of شريف,<br>\
and it is said in the O that شَرَفٌ is syn. with<br>\
شُرَفَآءُ; but in the L it is said that it is syn. with<br>\
شَرِيفٌ; and hence the saying هُوَ شَرَفُ قَوْمِهِ<br>\
meaning He is the شَرِيف of his people, and<br>\
كَرَمُهُمْ meaning the كَرِيم of them; and thus it<br>\
has been expl. as used in a trad.: (TA:) [but<br>\
both these assertions are probably correct; for it<br>\
seems to be, agreeably with analogy, an inf. n.<br>\
used as an epithet, and therefore applicable to a<br>\
single person and to a pl. number, and also to two<br>\
persons, and likewise to a female as well as to a<br>\
male.] ―<br>\

applied to the he-camel; but it is so applied, as<br>\
well as to the she-camel, accord. to the Towsheeh<br>\

black decrepit she-camels, (Aboo-Bekr, TA,)<br>\
الشُّرُفُ الجُونُ, with two dammehs, [which I think<br>\
a mistake, unless it mean with a dammeh to each<br>\

occurring in a trad., meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Trials, or conflicts and factions,] like portions of the dark<br>\

the case in my rendering]: or of which the<br>\
feathers and the sinews [wherewith they are<br>\
bound] have become uncompact: or slender and<br>\

[so in the O, and in one of my copies of the S:<br>\
in my other copy of the S, and in the K, جَبَلٌ,<br>\
i. e. the name of a certain mountain:] a postclassical word. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And شَارُوفٌ also signifies A broom: (S, O, K:) a Pers. word, (S,)<br>\
arabicized, from جَارُوبٌ, (O, K,) originally جَاىْ<br>\
رُوبْ, which means “ a place-sweeper. ” (O.)<br>\
أَشْرَفُ [More, and most, high, elevated, exalted,<br>\

meaning the “ being curved in the back ”]. (TA.)<br>\
And أُذُنٌ شَرْفَآءُ A long ear; (S, O, K;) standing<br>\

signifies Having a prominent, or an apparent,<br>\
ear: opposed to أَسَكُّ, q. v. ―<br>\
-b4-  Hence,] الأَشْرَفُ is<br>\
an appellation of The bat; (O, K, TA;) because<br>\
its ears are prominent and apparent: it is bare of<br>\
downy and other feathers, and is viviparous, not<br>\
oviparous: so in the saying of Bishr Ibn-ElMoatemir,<br>\
وَطَائِرٌ لَيْسَ لَهُ وَكْرُ وَطَائِرٌ أَشْرَفُ ذُو جُرْدَةٍ<br>\
[And a flying thing that has prominent and apparent ears and a denuded body, and a flying thing<br>\
that has no nest]: (O, TA:) in the K is added,<br>\
and another bird, that has no nest, &amp;c.: but this<br>\
is taken from an explanation of the latter hemistich of the verse cited above; which explanation<br>\
is as follows: (TA:) the bird that has no nest is<br>\
one of which the Bahránees [so in the TA, but<br>\
accord. to the O “ the sailors,”] tell that it does<br>\
not alight save while it makes, of the dust, or<br>\
earth, a place in which it lays its eggs, and which<br>\
it covers over; then it flies into the air, and its<br>\
eggs break open of themselves at the expiration<br>\
of the term thereof; and when its young ones are<br>\
able to fly, they do after the habit of their parents.<br>\
(O, L, TA: and the same is said, less fully, in the<br>\
K.) ―<br>\

O, K, *) pl. of شُرْفَةٌ [q. v.]: (O:) the pl. of أَشْرَفُ<br>\
and of شَرْفَآءُ, accord. to rule, is شُرْفٌ. (Mgh. [In<br>\
the copies of the K, الشُّرُفُ is erroneously said to<br>\
be pl. of الشَّرْفَآءُ.]) It is said in a trad. of Ibn-<br>\
&#39; Abbás, أُمِرْنَا أَنْ نَبْنِىَ المَدَائِنَ شُرْفًا وَالمَسَاجِدَ جُمًّا<br>\
i. e. We have been commanded to build cities<br>\
with شُرَف and mosques without شُرَف. (Mgh, O. *)<br>\
أَشْرَافٌ The ears and nose of a man: (O, K,<br>\

an epistle, considered as conferring honour: pl.<br>\
تَشْرِيفَاتٌ.]<br>\
مَشْرَفٌ: see شَرَفٌ, in the middle of the paragraph: and see also what here next follows.<br>\
مُشْرَفٌ, (O, K,) like مُكْرَمٌ, (K,) or ↓ مَشْرَفٌ<br>\
[q. v. voce شَرَفٌ], (so in my two copies of the S,)<br>\
A place from which one overlooks, i. e. looks upon,<br>\
or views, [a thing] from above. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence the saying in a trad., مَا جَآءَكَ مِنْ هٰذَا<br>\
المَالِ وَأَنْتَ غَيْرُ مُشْرَفٍ وَلَا سَائِلٍ فَخْذْهُ (O, TA)<br>\

called in relation to مَشَارِفُ, (S,) or in relation to<br>\
مَشَارِفُ الشَّامِ, (O, Msb, K,) i. e. certain towns, or<br>\
villages, of the land of the Arabs, near to the<br>\
رِيف [q. v.]: (S, O, Msb, K:) so says AO: (S,<br>\
O:) or, as some say, this is a mistake, and they<br>\
are so called in relation to a place of El-Yemen:<br>\
(Msb:) [or, accord. to some, in relation to المَشَارِفُ,<br>\
certain towns, or villages, near Howrán: (see<br>\
De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Ar., sec. ed., iii. 53:)] and it is<br>\
said that مَشْرَف was the name of a blacksmith<br>\
who made swords: (TA:) one says سَيْفٌ مَشْرَفِىٌّ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb,) not مَشَارِفِىٌّ, because a rel. n. is not<br>\
formed from a pl. of the measure of مَشَارِفُ.<br>\
(S, O.)<br>\
مُشَرَّفٌ [Elevated, or exalted, in rank, condition,<br>\
or estimation; or ennobled]; (K, TA;) an epithet<br>\
applied to a man; from الشَّرَفُ. (TA.)<br>\
