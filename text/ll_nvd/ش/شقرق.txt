شَرَقْرَقٌ, (K,) [the first and second now applied to<br>\
The green wood-pecker, picus viridis: and to the<br>\
common roller, coracias garrula:] a certain bird,<br>\

Arabs, (Fr, TA,) called أَخْيَل, (Fr, S, O, Msb,<br>\

evil omen; (S;) less than the pigeon, the colour<br>\

words of Lth, بارض الجرم, thus, with ج, [perhaps<br>\

hot,] in the places in which palm-trees grow; of the<br>\
