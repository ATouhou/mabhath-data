شُوْلٌ, (TK,) It rose; or became raised, or elevated;<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K;) said, in this sense, of a she-camel&#39;s tail; (S, O, K;) [and in like manner of a<br>\

-b2-  [Hence,] شال المِيْزَانُ The balance had<br>\
one of its two scales higher than the other, (S, O,<br>\
Msb, TA,) by reason of its lightness. (Msb.)<br>\

inf. n. شَوَلَانٌ, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one was overcome in contending with another for superiority<br>\

and شال الزِّقُّ, The legs of the water-skin, and of<br>\
the skin for wine &amp;c., became raised, or elevated,<br>\

(عِزُّهُمْ) departed: (O, K:) or their abodes became<br>\
clear of them, as though lightened of them, (خَفَّتْ<br>\

(TA:) or their expression of opinion was, or became, discordant: (تَفَرَّقَتْ كَلِمَتُهُمْ: K:) or they<br>\
died: and they became scattered, or dispersed; as<br>\
though there remained not of them save a remnant; [see شَوْلٌ;] النَّعَامَةُ signifying الجَمَاعَةُ:<br>\
(TA:) or they became irresolute, by reason of<br>\
fear, and fled: (Msb:) or they were frightened,<br>\
and fled. (M in art. رأل.) [See also نَعَامَةٌ: and<br>\
see a verse cited voce إِمَّا.]<br>\
-A2-  شُلْتُ بِهِ, and شُلْتُهُ;<br>\
(Msb;) and ↓ أَشَلْتُهُ; (O, Msb;) or شُلْتُ بِالجَرَّةِ,<br>\
for which one should not say شِلْتُ [which the<br>\

شَوَّلَ شوّلت, said of a she-camel, (S, O, K,) She<br>\
became such as is termed شَائِلَة: (S, O, TA: [in<br>\
one of my copies of the S, صَارَ شَوْلًا is erroneously<br>\
put for صَارَتْ شَائِلَةً:]) or her supplies of milk<br>\
dried up; (جَفَّتْ أَلْبَانُهَا; K, TA; [but perhaps the<br>\
right reading is خَفَّتْ, meaning became scanty;<br>\
for SM adds,]) and became little in quantity.<br>\
(TA.) And شوّلت الإِبِلُ The camels became in<br>\
such a state that their bellies [were drawn up as<br>\
though they] reached their backs: (K, TA:) or<br>\
became such as to have [only] a شَوْل [or small<br>\
quantity remaining] of milk: like as one says,<br>\
(O, TA,) شوّلت المَزَادَةُ The مزادة [or leathern<br>\
water-bag] had little water remaining in it: (O,<br>\
K, TA:) one should not say شَالَت. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence, app.,] تَشْوِيلٌ of the ذَكَر signifies Its<br>\
being in a relaxed state on the occasion of مُجَامَعَة.<br>\
(O, K.) And شوّل said of a horse means, like<br>\

حَتَّى إِذَا مَا العِشْرُ عَنْهَا شَوَّلَا<br>\
the poet means, ذَهَبَ and تَصَرَّمَ [i. e. Until, when<br>\
the coming to water on the tenth day after the<br>\
next preceding period of abstinence ceased from<br>\
her or them... referring to a camel or to camels].<br>\

شَالٌ A certain fish of the sea, or of great rivers<br>\
(سَمَكَةٌ بَحْرِيَّةٌ): (TA:) [in Egypt this name is<br>\
applied to a fish of the genus silurus, found in the<br>\
Nile: it is well described by Sonnini, in p. 407<br>\
of the 4to Engl. ed. of his Travels in Upper and<br>\
Lower Egypt.]<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain kind of رِدَآء<br>\
[here meaning shawl], made in Cashmere and<br>\
Lahore, and brought for sale to other countries;<br>\
[erroneously] said to be made of camels&#39; fur; and<br>\
so called because raised to the shoulders, if it be<br>\

and of the leathern water-bag: (TA:) [in the<br>\
CK, المالُ القَلِيلُ is erroneously put for المَآءُ<br>\

(Meyd, TA,) i. e. Her small quantity of water<br>\

if thou be in want of it: (Meyd:) or applied to<br>\

-b2-  And A man light, active, or agile,<br>\
(خَفِيفٌ,) in work, and in service, (S, O, K,) and<br>\

See also what next follows.]<br>\
شُوَلٌ, like صُرَدٌ [in measure], One who aids, or<br>\

شَوْلَةٌ The part that it raises of the tail of the<br>\
scorpion; (S, O, K;) and so ↓ شَوْلٌ: (Ham p.<br>\
649:) or, accord. to Sh, its sting, with which it<br>\
strikes. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] الشَّوْلَةُ (assumed tropical:)  Two bright<br>\
stars, near together, [<br>\
λ and<br>\
ν,] (S, O,) in the end<br>\
of the tail of Scorpio, (Kzw,) which are one of the<br>\
Mansions of the Moon, (S, O, Kzw,) namely, the<br>\
Nineteenth Mansion; (Kzw;) also called حُمَةُ<br>\
العَقْرَبِ. (S, O.) [See مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And شَوْلَةُ is a proper name for The scorpion;<br>\
(O, TA;) [and] so ↓ شَوَّالَةُ. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A<br>\
foolish, or stupid, woman. (IAar, O, K.) شَوْلَةُ<br>\
was the name of A certain foolish female slave,<br>\
belonging to [the tribe of] &#39;Adwán, and she used<br>\
to give advice to her masters, and it resulted in<br>\
evil to them; whence the saying, أَنْتَ شَوْلَةُ النَّاصِحَةُ<br>\
[Thou art Showleh the giver of advice]. (S, O,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also the name of The mare of Zeyd-el-Fawáris Ed-Dabbee. (O, K.)<br>\
شُوَيْلَآءُ A certain plant, (AHn, O, K,) mentioned, but not described, by As; of the kind<br>\
termed عُشْب, growing in plain, or soft, land,<br>\
(AHn, O,) used as a medicament, (AHn, O, K,)<br>\
and well known: (AHn, O:) [Sgh says,] I have<br>\
seen it: it is dust-coloured, spreads upon the<br>\
ground, has no thorns, and the cattle eagerly<br>\
desire it: (O:) it is called (O, K) sometimes, (K,)<br>\
by some of the people of El-&#39;Irák, (O,) ↓ شُوَّيْلٌ,<br>\
like فُبَّيْطٌ [in measure]. (O, K.)<br>\
شَوَّالٌ The tail of the scorpion. (TA. [So called<br>\
because often raised.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
and sometimes it is called الشَّوَّالُ, (Msb,) The<br>\
month of the festival of the breaking of the fast;<br>\
(Msb, K; *) the month next after رَمَضَان; (TA;)<br>\
the first of the months of the pilgrimage; (S, O;)<br>\
[the tenth month of the lunar year:] as some<br>\
assert, (IDrd, O,) so called because [when first<br>\
thus named] it coincided with the season when<br>\
the she-camels [being seven or eight months gone<br>\
with young] raised their tails: (IDrd, O, Msb,<br>\
TA:) [for the camels generally couple in winter:]<br>\
or because of their milk becoming then withdrawn; such being the case with the camels in<br>\
the time of vehement heat and of the coming to an<br>\
end of the juicy fresh herbage: [see a table of the<br>\
months voce زَمَنٌ:] the Arabs used to regard the<br>\
making of marriage-contracts in this month as of<br>\
evil omen; and to say that the woman [then]<br>\
married would resist him who married her, like<br>\
as the she-camel resists the stallion and raises her<br>\
tail; but the Prophet abolished their thus auguring, and he married &#39;Áïsheh in this month:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. is شَوَّالَاتٌ and شَوَاوِيلُ (S, Msb, K)<br>\
and شَوَاوِلُ, this last formed by rejecting the augmentative letter [in the second]. (TA.)<br>\
شُوَّيْلٌ: see شُوَيْلَآءُ.<br>\
شَوَّالَةٌ [not (as is implied in the K) شَوَّالَةُ] A<br>\
certain bird, (AHát, O, K,) a دُخَّلَة [n. un. of<br>\
دُخَّلٌ q. v.], of a dusky colour, which, when it<br>\
alights upon a stone or a tree, moves up and down<br>\
its tail like as does the camel; so called because<br>\
it raises its tail; and in its belly and its hinder<br>\
part is somewhat of redness. (AHát, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also شَوْلَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, as being likened to the<br>\
scorpion, whence also the phrase إِنَّهُ لَتَدِبُّ عَقَارِبُهُ,]<br>\
اِمْرَأَةٌ شَوَّالَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A woman wont to calumniate. (K.)<br>\
شَائِلٌ A she-camel raising her tail, (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) having conceived, (Msb,) or by reason of<br>\
having conceived, and having no milk whatever:<br>\
(S, O, K:) or a she-camel that has conceived, and<br>\
raises her tail to the stallion as a sign of her<br>\
having conceived, raising her head therewith, and<br>\
elevating her nose: (Az, TA:) the word is without<br>\
ة because it is an epithet of peculiar application<br>\
[to a female]: (Msb:) or it is without ة anomalously; for the male also raises his tail: (ISd,<br>\
TA:) the pl. is شُوَّلٌ (Az, S, O, Msb, K) and شُيَّلٌ<br>\
and شِيَّلٌ and شُوَّالٌ. (K.) Also, with ة, applied to<br>\
a mare, as meaning Raising the tail. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And شَائِلَةٌ, which is anomalously with ة because<br>\
it is an epithet denoting an attribute not shared<br>\
with the female by the male, (ISd, TA,) A she-camel that has passed seven months, (S, O, K,)<br>\
or eight, (S, O,) since the period of her bringing<br>\
forth, (S, O, K,) or of her becoming pregnant,<br>\
(K,) and whose milk has dried up, (جَفَّ لَبَنُهَا,<br>\
K, and so in a copy of the S,) or whose<br>\
milk has become scanty, (خَفَّ لَبَنُهَا, O, and<br>\
so in another copy of the S,) and her udder<br>\
drawn up, (S, O,) there remaining in her udder<br>\
no more than a شَوْل, a third of the quantity of the<br>\
contents thereof when her bringing forth was<br>\
recent: (TA:) she-camels in this case are termed<br>\
↓ شَوْلٌ, (S, O, K,) an anomalous pl., (K,) [or<br>\
rather a quasi-pl. n.,] expl. by some as applied to<br>\
she-camels whose milk has become deficient, which<br>\
is the case when their young are weaned at the<br>\
period of the [auroral] rising of سُهَيْل [or Canopus, a period which commenced, in Central Arabia,<br>\
about the beginning of the era of the Flight, on<br>\
the 4th of August, O. S.], and they cease not to<br>\
be thus termed until the stallion is sent among<br>\
them; (TA;) the pl. pl. [or pl. of شَوْلٌ] is أَشْوَالٌ;<br>\
(K;) and شَوَائِلُ is a pl. of شَائِلَةٌ meaning [as expl.<br>\
above, or] a she-camel whose milk has become<br>\
withdrawn. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  شَائِلٌ is also applied to<br>\
Anything that is raised, or drawn up, or withdrawn. (TA.)<br>\
شَوْشَلَآءُ Initus; syn. نَيْكٌ: said to be an Abyssinian word. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
مِشْوَلٌ A small مِنْجَل [or reaping-hook: in the<br>\
CK, erroneously, مُنْخُل]. (S, O, K, TA.)<br>\
مُشِيلٌ act. part. n. of 4. See an ex. in a verse<br>\
cited voce خَافِض; cited also in the present art. in<br>\
the S and O.<br>\
مِشْوَلَةٌ is said by Yz to signify A certain thing<br>\
with which one plays. (O, TA.)<br>\
مِشْوَالٌ A stone that is raised. (Lh, K.)<br>\
