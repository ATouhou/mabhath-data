phrase يُؤَخِّرُونَ الصَّلَاةَ إِلَى شَرَقِ المَوْتَى, (S, M, O,<br>\
K, [in the CK, erroneously, شَرْقِ,]) occurring in<br>\
a trad., (S, M, O,) in a saying of the Prophet,<br>\
(O, K,) is expl. as meaning Who postpone, or<br>\
defer, the prayer until there remains not, (S, M,<br>\
O, K,) of the sun, (S,) or of the day, (M, O, K,)<br>\

the meaning is, until the sun is [but just] above<br>\

to the east: (M, TA:) and he directed himself to<br>\
the east. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He prayed at sunrise:<br>\
and hence, app., He performed the prayer of the<br>\
festival of the sacrifice: (TA:) or this meaning is<br>\
from شَرَقَتِ الشَّمْسُ. (Mgh: it is also mentioned<br>\
in the M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  شرّقت الأَرْضُ, inf. n. as above, The<br>\
land became affected with drought, and dryness<br>\
of the earth, being [parched by the sun and] not<br>\
reached by water: whence the term ↓ شَرَاقِىّ<br>\
[q. v.] in the dial. of Egypt. (TA.) ―<br>\

also signifies The being beautiful, and [sunny or]<br>\
shining in face. (Sh, O, K.)<br>\

manner also] تَشْرِيقُ الشَّعِيرِ signifies The throwing<br>\
barley in a sunny place in order that it may dry.<br>\
(Mgh.) And one says of the [wild] bull, يُشَرِّقُ<br>\
مَتْنَهُ, meaning He exposes his back to the sun in<br>\
order that what is upon it of the dew of night<br>\
may dry: in this sense the phrase is used by<br>\
Aboo-Dhu-eyb. (M.) ―<br>\

sacrifice: (S, M, O, Msb:) [i. e. the eleventh and<br>\
twelfth and thirteenth days of Dhu-l-Hijjeh:]<br>\
these days were so called because the flesh of the<br>\
victims was therein cut into strips, and dried in<br>\
the sun, or spread in the sun to dry: (S, M, Mgh,<br>\
O, Msb, K: *) or because the victims were not<br>\
sacrificed until the sun rose: (IAar, S, O, K:) or<br>\
from the prayer of the day of sacrifice, which<br>\
they follow: (Mgh:) or because they used to say,<br>\
[on that day,] (S, M, O,) in the Time of Ignorance, (M,) ثَبِيرْ كَيْمَا نُغِيرْ ↓ أَشْرِقْ, (S, M, O,)<br>\
which means Enter thou upon the time of sunrise, Thebeer, (addressing one of the mountains<br>\
of Mekkeh, M, * Mgh,) that we may push, or<br>\
press, on, or forward, (M, Mgh, Msb,) to return<br>\
from Minè: (M: [see also 4 in art. غور:]) Aboo-<br>\
Haneefeh used to hold that التَّشْرِيق means التَّكْبِير<br>\
[i. e. the saying اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرْ]; but none beside him<br>\
has held this opinion. (TA.) It is said in a trad.<br>\
that the days thus called are days of eating and<br>\
drinking, and of celebrating the praises of God.<br>\
(O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  شرّق الثَّوْبَ (assumed tropical:)  He made [or dyed] the<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth, yellow: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád,<br>\
O:) [or he dyed it red: (see the pass. part. n.,<br>\
below:)] or تَشْرِيقٌ signifies the dyeing with saffron, (M, L,) so that the thing dyed is saturated,<br>\
(L,) or not so that the thing is saturated: (so in<br>\
a copy of the M:) it is not with safflower. (M, L.<br>\
[See also 4, last signification.])<br>\
-A3-  شرّق الَحْوَض is<br>\
sometimes said for صَرَّجَهُ, meaning He plastered<br>\
the watering-trough, or tank, with شَارُوق [q. v.],<br>\
or صَارُوج. (M in art. صرج.)<br>\

اشرق وَجْهُهُ, (S,) and لَوْنُهُ, (M,) His face, (S,)<br>\
and his colour, or complexion, (M,) shone, (S,<br>\
M,) and was bright, with beauty. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Some<br>\
allow its being made trans.; [meaning It caused,<br>\
or made, to shine;] as in the saying,<br>\
ثَلَاثَةٌ تُشْرَقُ الدُّنْيَا بِبَهْجَتِهَا<br>\
شَمْسُ الضُّحَى وَأَبُو إِسْحَاقَ والقَمَرُ<br>\
[There are three things, with the beauty of which<br>\
the world is made to shine; the sun of the bright<br>\
early morning, and Aboo-Is-hák, and the moon]:<br>\
but there is no proof in this, because [the right<br>\
reading may be تُشْرِقُ, and so] الدنيا may be an<br>\
agent; therefore the making the verb trans. [in<br>\
this sense] is said to be post-classical, though it is<br>\
mentioned by the author of the Ksh. (MF, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  It signifies also He entered upon the time of<br>\
sunrise: (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K:) similarly to<br>\
أَفْجَرَ, and أَصْبَحَ, and أَظْهَرَ. (TA.) See 2.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
اشرق عَدُوَّهُ He caused his enemy to become choked<br>\
[with his spittle, or with water, or the like: see 1].<br>\

utterance, or impeded the action, of such a one;]<br>\
I did not allow such a one to say, or to do, a<br>\
thing. (Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اشرق الثَّوْبَ بِالصِّبْغِ, (Moheet,<br>\
A, O,) or فِى الصِّبْغِ, (K,) (tropical:)  He exceeded the<br>\
usual degree in dyeing the garment, or piece of<br>\

5<br>\
تشرّق He sat in a sunny place (S, O, K) [at<br>\
any season, (see مَشْرُقَةٌ,) or particularly] in winter. (O, K.) ―<br>\

in one of my copies of the S in the place of the<br>\
former:) [or] ↓ شَرْقَةٌ has this signification: (M,<br>\
Msb:) and شَرْقٌ signifies the rising sun; (M,<br>\
TA;) as some say; (M;) thus accord. to AA<br>\
and IAar; (TA;) and so ↓ شَرَقٌ, (M, Msb,) and<br>\
↓ شَرْقَةٌ, and ↓ شَرِقَةٌ, (M, K,) and ↓ شَرَقَةٌ, (TA,) and<br>\
↓ شَارِقٌ, (S, * M, K,) and ↓ شَرِيقٌ: (M, K:) one<br>\
says, طَلَعَتِ الشَّرْقُ The sun rose; (S, M, O; in<br>\
one of my copies of the S ↓ الشَّرَقُ;) but not<br>\
غَرَبَتِ الشَّرْقُ: (M:) and ↓ آتِيكَ كُلَّ شَارِقٍ I will<br>\
come to thee every day that the sun rises: or, as<br>\
some say, شَارِقٌ signifies the upper limb (قَرْن) of<br>\
the sun: (M:) and one says, لَا آتِيكَ مَا ذَرَّ شَارِقٌ<br>\

gate in Heaven, called ↓ المِشْرِيقُ [q. v.], قَدْ رُدَّ<br>\
حَتَّى مَا بَقِىَ إِلَّا شَرْقُهُ (O, K, TA) i. e. It had<br>\

كِلْسٌ, [q. v.,] (Kr, M,) i. q. صَارُوجٌ. (K. [See<br>\
this last word: and see also the last sentence of<br>\
the next preceding paragraph above.])<br>\
مَشْرَقٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
مَشْرِقٌ (S, M, O, Msb, K,) which by rule<br>\
should be ↓ مَشْرَقٌ, (M, Msb,) but this latter is<br>\
rarely used, (Msb,) The place, (M,) or quarter,<br>\
or direction, (Msb,) of sunrise; (M, Msb;) [the<br>\
east, or orient;] and ↓ شَرْقٌ signifies the same;<br>\
(S, M, O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ مِشْرِيقٌ: (Seer, M:)<br>\
the pl. of the first is مَشَارِقُ; and the pl. of ↓ شَرْقٌ<br>\
is أَشْرَاقٌ. (M.) The dual, المَشْرِقَانِ, means The<br>\
place of sunrise of summer and that of winter<br>\
[E. 26 degrees N. and E. 26 degrees S. in Central Arabia]. (S,<br>\
O, TA.) And also The place of sunrise and the<br>\
place of sunset; [or the east and the west;] (M,<br>\
O;) the former being thus made predominant<br>\
because it denotes existence, whereas the latter<br>\
denotes non-existence: (M:) thus in the saying,<br>\
(M, O,) in the Kur [xliii. 37], (O,) يَا لَيْتَ بَيْنِى<br>\
وَبَيْنَكَ بُعْدَ الْمَشْرِقَيْنِ [O, would that between me<br>\
and thee were the distance of the east and the<br>\
west]. (M, O.) And [in like manner] one says<br>\
↓ مَا بَيْنَ الشَّرْقَيْنِ, meaning What is between<br>\
the place of sunrise and the place of sunset. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also مَشْرُقَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  The saying, cited by IAar,<br>\
قُلْتُ لِسَعْدٍ وَهْوَ بِالأَزْارِقِ<br>\
عَلَيْكَ بِالمَحْضِ وَبِالمَشَارِقِ<br>\
he explains as meaning [I said to Saad, he being<br>\
at El-Azárik (a certain water in the بَادِيَة, TA<br>\
in art. زرق)], Keep thou [to pure milk, and] to<br>\
the sun [or the places of sunshine] in winter: but<br>\
[ISd says,] in my opinion, المَشَارِق is here pl. of<br>\
↓ مُشَرَّقٌ applied to flesh-meat that is “ [cut into<br>\
strips and] spread in the sun [to dry]; ” and this<br>\
is confirmed by his saying بالمحض, each of them<br>\
being food. (M.)<br>\
مُشْرِقٌ: see شَرِقٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Entering upon the<br>\
time of sunrise: the pl. occurs in this sense in the<br>\
Kur xv. 73 and xxvi. 60. (TA.)<br>\

O, K,) the last mentioned by Ks, (O,) A place of<br>\
sitting in the sun; (S, O, K;) accord. to some,<br>\
peculiarly, (TA,) in the winter; (O, K, TA;)<br>\
and ↓ شَرْقَةٌ and ↓ مِشْرَاقٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ مِشْرِيقٌ<br>\
(O, K) signify the same: (S, O, K:) or a place<br>\
upon which the sun shines; accord. to some,<br>\
peculiarly, in the winter, (M,) as also ↓ شَرْقَةٌ and<br>\
↓ شَرَقَةٌ (M, TA) and ↓ شَرْقٌ (M) and مشرق [app.<br>\
↓ مَشْرِقٌ, of the pl. of which, or of one of the first<br>\
three words in this paragraph, see an ex. in a<br>\
verse cited voce مَشْرِقٌ if the explanation of that<br>\
verse by IAar be correct]. (TA.)<br>\
مَشْرِقِىٌّ (Msb, TA) and مَشْرَقِىٌّ both [applied<br>\
to a man] signify Of the east; or eastern: (Msb:)<br>\
pl. مَشَارِقَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
مُشَرَّقٌ A place of prayer; syn. مُصَلًّى; (As, S,<br>\
M, Mgh, K;) i. e., in an absolute sense: (TA:)<br>\
or the place of prayer of the festival (العِيد):<br>\
(TA:) or the place of prayer of the two festivals:<br>\
and المُشَرَّقُ is said to mean the place of prayer of<br>\
the festival at Mekkeh: (M, TA:) and the mosque<br>\
of El-Kheyf. (S, K.) ―<br>\

its verb: or] dyed with a red colour. (O, K.)<br>\

2, last sentence,)] plastered with شَارُوق. (O, K.)<br>\
مُشَرِّقٌ Taking to the direction of the east, or<br>\
place of sunrise: one says, شَتَّانَ بَيْنَ مُشَرِّقٍ<br>\
وَمُغَرِّبٍ [Different, or widely different, are one<br>\
going towards the east and one going towards the<br>\
west]. (S.)<br>\
