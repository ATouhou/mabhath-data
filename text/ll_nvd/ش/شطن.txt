(TA.)<br>\
Q. Q. 2<br>\
تَشَيْطَنَ: see what next precedes.<br>\
شَطَنٌ A rope, (S, Msb, K,) in a general sense:<br>\
(K:) or a long rope: (Kh, S, K:) or a long and<br>\
strongly-twisted rope by means of which one<br>\
draws water: (TA:) pl. أَشْطَانٌ. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
Mention is made, in a trad., of a horse as being<br>\
مَرْبُوطٌ بِشَطَنَيْنِ [i. e. Tied with two ropes, or long<br>\
ropes, &amp;c.,] because of his strength. (TA.) And<br>\
one says of a strong-spirited horse, إِنَّهُ لَيَنْزُو بَيْنَ<br>\
شَطَنَيْنِ [Verily he leaps between two ropes, or<br>\
long ropes, &amp;c.]: a saying applied as a prov. to<br>\
him who exults, or exults greatly, or excessively,<br>\
and behaves insolently and ungratefully, and is<br>\
strong. (TA.) An Arab of the desert described<br>\
a horse (S, Msb) that did not become abraded in<br>\
the sole of his hoof (so in a copy of the S) by<br>\
saying, كَأَنَّهُ شَيْطَانٌ فِى أَشْطَانٍ [As though he<br>\
were a devil in ropes, or long ropes, &amp;c.]. (S,<br>\
Msb.)<br>\
نَوًى شَطُونٌ (S) or نِيَّةٌ شَطُونٌ (K) [A place to<br>\
which one purposes journeying] that is distant, or<br>\
remote. (S, K.) And غَزْوَةٌ شَطُونٌ [A warring<br>\
and plundering expedition] that is distant. (K.)<br>\
And حَرْبٌ شَطُونٌ [Distant war: or] (assumed tropical:)  war that<br>\
is difficult [because distant]. (TA. See an ex. in<br>\
a verse cited voce جُبَّةٌ.) [See also شَطِينٌ, and<br>\
شَاطِنٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  بِئْرٌ شَطُونٌ (tropical:)  A deep well, (S, K, TA,)<br>\
curving in its interior: (TA:) or a well from<br>\
which the bucket is drawn out by means of two<br>\
ropes, from its two sides, wide in the upper part<br>\
and narrow in the lower part; (K, TA;) so that<br>\
if one draws out the bucket from it by means of<br>\
one rope, one draws it against the casing, and it<br>\
becomes rent. (TA.) And رُمْحٌ شَطُونٌ (assumed tropical:)  A long<br>\
and crooked spear. (TA.)<br>\
شَطِينٌ Distant, or remote. (TA. [See also<br>\
شَطُونٌ, and شَاطِنٌ.])<br>\
شَاطِنٌ [Distant, or remote, in respect of the<br>\
place of alighting or abode]; i. q. شَاطِبٌ [q. v.].<br>\
(TA in art. شطب. [See also شَطُونٌ, and شَطِينٌ.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  Far from the truth [and from the<br>\
mercy of God: see 1]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And i. q.<br>\
خَبِيثٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Bad, corrupt, &amp;c.; like سَاطِنٌ]. (K.)<br>\
Umeiyeh (S, TA) Ibn-Abi-s-Salt, referring to<br>\
Solomon, (TA,) says,<br>\
أَيُّمَا شَاطِنٍ عَصَاهُ عَكَاهُ<br>\
ثُمَّ يُلْقَى فِى السِّجْنِ وَالأَغْلَالِ<br>\
[Whatever bad one disobeyed him, he bound him<br>\
in irons; then he was cast into the prison and the<br>\
shackles for the neck and hands]. (S, TA.)<br>\
شَيْطَانٌ a word of well-known meaning [i. e. A<br>\
devil; and with the article ال, the devil, Satan]:<br>\
(S, K:) any that is excessively, or inordinately,<br>\
proud or corrupt or unbelieving or rebellious, or<br>\
that is insolent and audacious in pride and in<br>\
acts of rebellion, of mankind, and of the jinn, or<br>\
genii, and of beasts; (A&#39;Obeyd, S, Msb, K;) as<br>\
is shown in relation to the first and second of<br>\
these by what is said in the Kur vi. 112, and ii.<br>\
13 and 96: (TA:) the ن is radical, (S, Msb,<br>\
TA,) the word being of the measure فَيْعَالٌ, from<br>\
شَطَنَ, (Msb, TA,) signifying “ he was, or became,<br>\
distant, or remote,” (TA,) or signifying “ he was,<br>\
or became, remote, or far, from the truth, and from<br>\
the mercy of God; ” (Msb;) as is indicated by the<br>\
pl. شَيَاطِينُ; [for] the reading of El-Hasan in the<br>\
Kur xxvi. 210, الشَّيَاطُونَ, is anomalous, [like<br>\
بَسَاتُونَ for بَسَاتِينُ,] and is said by Th to be a<br>\
mistake: (TA:) or, as some say, the ن is augmentative, (S, Msb, TA, *) and the ى is radical,<br>\
so that the word is of the measure فَعْلَان, (Msb,)<br>\
from شَاطَ, aor. يَشِيطُ, (Msb, TA,) signifying “ it<br>\
was, or became, null, void, of no account,” and<br>\
the like, and “ it burned,” or “ became burnt,”<br>\
(Msb,) or signifying “ he burned with anger: ”<br>\
but the former opinion is the more common:<br>\
(TA:) [in the Kur, the word is always perfectly<br>\
decl.; and so it is said to be by SM, in art. شيط<br>\
of the TA; unless used as a proper name: but J<br>\
says,] if you make it to be of the measure فَيْعَال<br>\
from تَشَيْطَنَ said of a man, [or rather because<br>\
they say of a man تشيطن,] you make it perfectly<br>\
decl.; but if you make it to be from شَيَّطَ [“ he<br>\
burned ” a thing], you make it imperfectly decl.,<br>\
because it is of the measure فَعْلَان. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
The serpent: (S, K:) or a certain species of<br>\
serpents; (Fr, S, TA;) having a mane, of foul<br>\
aspect: or, as some say, a slender, light, or active,<br>\
serpent. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Respecting the saying in the<br>\
Kur [xxxvii. 63], طَلْعُهَا كَأَنَّهُ رُؤُوسُ الشَّيَاطِينِ<br>\
[Its fruit is as though it were the heads of the<br>\
شياطين], Fr says that there are three ways in<br>\
which it may be explained: one is, that the طلع<br>\
is likened to the heads of the شياطين [meaning<br>\
devils] in respect of foulness, or ugliness, because<br>\
these are described as foul, or ugly: (S:) or it is<br>\
likened to the evil in disposition of the jinn,<br>\
because these are imagined as foul, or ugly: Zj<br>\
says, in explaining it, that one says of a thing<br>\
deemed foul, or ugly, كَأَنَّهُ وَجْهُ شَيْطَانٍ [as<br>\
though it were the face of a devil], and كَأَنَّهُ رَأْسُ<br>\
شَيْطَانٍ [as though it were the head of a devil];<br>\
for though the شيطان is not seen, he is conceived<br>\
in the mind as the foulest, or ugliest, of things:<br>\
(TA:) the second is, that [the meaning is foul,<br>\
or ugly, serpents; for] the Arabs apply the name<br>\
شيطان to a sort of serpents, having a mane, foul,<br>\
or ugly, in the head and face: (S, TA: *) the<br>\
third is, that a certain foul, or ugly, plat is<br>\
named رُؤُوسُ الشَّيَاطِينِ; (S, TA;) which is expl.<br>\
in the K only as meaning a certain plant. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  شَيْطَانُ الفَلَا [lit. The devil of the waterless<br>\
deserts] means (assumed tropical:)  thirst. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  شَيْطَانٌ signifies<br>\
also (assumed tropical:)  Any blamable faculty, or power, [or propensity,] of a man. (Er-Rághib, TA.) One says,<br>\
رَكِبَهُ شَيْطَانُهُ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [His anger got the ascendency<br>\
over him; or] he was, or became, angry. (TA.)<br>\
And نَزَعَ شَيْطَانَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He plucked out his pride.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also, [probably as being likened to a<br>\
serpent,] (assumed tropical:)  A mark made with a hot iron in the<br>\
upper part of the haunch of a camel, perpendicularly, upon the thigh, extending to the hock; (K,<br>\
TA;) from the “ Tedhkireh ” of Aboo-&#39;Alee;<br>\
(TA;) likewise called ↓ مُشَيْطَنَةٌ. (AZ, K, TA.)<br>\
الشَّيْطَانِيَّةُ A certain sect of the extravagant<br>\
zealots of [the schismatics called] the شِيعَة; so<br>\
named from [their founder] شَيْطَانُ الطَّاقِ, (TA,)<br>\
an appellation of Mohammad Ibn-En-Noaman.<br>\
(K and TA in art. طوق.)<br>\
مُشَاطِنٌ One who draws out the bucket from<br>\
the well بِشَطَنَيْنِ, (K, TA,) i. e. with two ropes.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُشَيْطَنَةٌ: see شَيْطَانٌ, last sentence.<br>\
