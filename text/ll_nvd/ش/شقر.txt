شَقِرَ, aor.<br>\
شَقَرَ, inf. n. شَقَرٌ (M, L, Msb, K [in<br>\
the CK and TA شَقْرٌ, which is evidently wrong,])<br>\
and شُقْرَةٌ, (Lth, K,) or the latter is a simple<br>\
subst.; (M;) and شَقُرَ; and ↓ اِشْقَرَّ; (M, K;) He<br>\

إِشْقَرَّ see 1.<br>\
شَقْرٌ: see شُقُورٌ.<br>\
شَقِرٌ [The red, or blood-coloured, anemone;] i. q.<br>\
شَقَائِقُ النُّعْمَانِ: (S, M, A, Msb, K:) it is not a<br>\
sweet-scented flower: (Msb:) n. un. with ة; (S,<br>\
M, Msb, K;) pl. [of the n. un.] شَقِرَاتٌ: (K:) as<br>\
also ↓ شُقَّارٌ and ↓ شَقِرَانٌ, (so in some copies of the<br>\
K,) the latter so written by IDrd and Sgh, and<br>\
thought by IDrd to be a place or a plant, (TA,)<br>\
or ↓ شُقْرَانٌ, (so in some copies of the K and in the<br>\
TA,) and ↓ شُقَّارَى and ↓ شُقَارَى: (K:) or شَقِرٌ is<br>\
the name of a certain other plant, not the شقائق,<br>\
but red like it: (M, * K, * TA:) or it signifies<br>\
cinnabar: (A:) or شَقِرَةٌ has this signification, (T,<br>\
K,) as well as that first assigned to it above:<br>\
(K:) and accord. to AHn, (M, TA,) ↓ شُقَّارَى is<br>\
the name of a certain plant (S, M, TA) that<br>\
grows is sands, having a pungent odour, which<br>\
is tasted in the flavour of milk: and he adds that,<br>\
accord. to some, it is the same as the شَقِر; but<br>\
that this opinion is not well founded: (M, TA:)<br>\
it is also said that it is a certain plant having<br>\
a flower of a dingy red colour, the seed, or grain,<br>\
of which is called خِمْخِمٌ: (TA:) and that ↓ شُقَّارَى<br>\
(M, TA) and ↓ شُقَارَى, (M,) or ↓ شُقَّارٌ, (TA,) are<br>\
names of a certain plant, having a flower of a<br>\
colour somewhat of that termed شُكْلَةٌ, with slender,<br>\
or delicate, dust-coloured leaves, which grows in<br>\
the manner of قَضْب [a kind of trefoil], is approved in pasturage, and grows only in fruitful<br>\
years. (M, TA.)<br>\

شُقْرَةٌ The colours described in the explanations<br>\
of the epithet أَشْقَرُ, below. (S, M, Msb, &amp;c.)<br>\
شَقِرَانٌ, or شُقْرَانٌ: see شَقِرٌ.<br>\
شَقِرَّاقٌ and its vars.: see in art. شقرق.<br>\
شَقُورٌ: see the next paragraph, in four places.<br>\
شُقُورٌ (AHeyth, Fr, A&#39;Obeyd, S, K) and ↓ شَقُورٌ<br>\
(AHeyth, As, Abu-l-Jarráh, S, K) A want; or a<br>\
needful, or requisite, thing, affair, or business:<br>\
(S, K:) or the former signifies wants: (Ham p.<br>\
716:) A&#39;Obeyd says that the former word is the<br>\
more correct, because شُقُورٌ signifies things, or<br>\
affairs, that cleave to the heart, disquieting it;<br>\
and is pl. of ↓ شَقْرٌ; and that ↓ شَقُورٌ, with fet-h,<br>\
has the signification of an epithet [meaning<br>\
cleaving to the heart and disquieting it]: (S:) or,<br>\
accord. to some, this latter signifies grief, mourning, sorrow, or sadness; disquietude of mind: or<br>\
disquietude of mind that causes one to be sleepless:<br>\
the former is also expl. as signifying a man&#39;s case,<br>\
and his secret: and ↓ both are also said to signify<br>\
tidings: and a man&#39;s state, or condition. (TA.)<br>\
One says, أَخْبَرْتُهُ بِشُقُورِى I acquainted him with<br>\
my want; like as one says أَفْضَيْتُ إِلَيْهِ بِعُجَرِى<br>\
وَبُجَرِى: (S:) or I acquainted him with my<br>\
tidings. (TA.) And أَفْضَيْتُ إِلَيْهِ بِشُقُورِى I acquainted him with my case, and with what I kept<br>\
secret from others; (TA;) and so نَفَضْتُ لَهُ<br>\
شُقُورِى: (Ham p. 716:) or I revealed to him my<br>\
secret, and acquainted him with all my affairs.<br>\
(Mgh.) And ↓ بَثَّهُ شَقُورَهُ, and شُقُورَهُ, He complained to him of his state, or condition. (M,<br>\
TA.)<br>\

أَشْقَرُ, applied to a man, [Of a ruddy complexion<br>\
combined with fairness: or] of a clear ruddy<br>\

red mane and tail: (S, M, K:) when the mane<br>\
and tail are black, the epithet كُمَيْتٌ [meaning<br>\
bay, or dark bay, or brown,] is applied to the<br>\
horse: (S:) the اشقر is said to be the best of<br>\
horses: (IAar, M: [but it is said in Har p. 399<br>\
to be regarded by the Arabs as of evil omen:])<br>\
and applied to a camel, intensely red: (S:) or of<br>\
a colour resembling that of a horse thus termed:<br>\
