Lyra,] consisting of ten stars, the bright star<br>\
[alpha] of which is called النَّسْرُ الوَاقِعُ: the Arabs<br>\
liken it to a vulture (نَسْر) which has contracted<br>\
its wings to itself, as though it had alighted upon<br>\
a thing: the vulgar call [the three chief stars in]<br>\
it الأَثَافِى: and before the bright star is a dim<br>\
star which the Arabs call الأَظْفَار [i. e. the talons].<br>\
