شَمَسَ (K) and<br>\
شَمُسَ also,<br>\
like فَضِلَ, aor. يَفْضُلُ, accord. to the lexicologists,<br>\
as ISd says, but he holds the aor. of شَمِسَ to<br>\
be<br>\
شَمَسَ [only]; (TA;) and ↓ اشمس; (S, K;) It (a<br>\
day) was, or became, sunny, or sunshiny; it had<br>\
sun, or sunshine: (S, Msb, K:) or it had sun, or<br>\
sunshine, all the daytime: or it was, or became,<br>\

and شِمَاسٌ, (S, Msb, K,) He (a horse) refused to<br>\
be ridden or mounted: (S, K:) or took fright and<br>\
broke loose and ran away, refusing to be ridden,<br>\
by reason of the vehemence of his force of resistance, [for لِشِدَّةِ متعبه in the TA, I read لشدّة<br>\
مَنَعَتِهِ,] and his sharpness of temper, so that he<br>\
would not remain still: (TA:) or became rebellious<br>\
against his rider. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] شَمَسَتِ<br>\
المَرْأَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The woman abstained from looking at<br>\

-b3-<br>\
And شَمَسَ لِى فُلَانٌ (tropical:)  Such a one showed enmity<br>\
to me: (K: *) or showed his enmity to me, (T, S,<br>\
A,) and almost made it to take effect, (A,) or as<br>\

فِى فُلَانٍ signifies, [unless فى be a mistake for<br>\
لِى, and فُلَانٍ for فُلَانٌ,] he showed his enmity<br>\
[towards such a one], and could not conceal it.<br>\

الشَّمْسُ [The sun;] the body of the solar light,<br>\
that runs its course in the firmament: (Lth, *<br>\
TA:) it is fem.: (S, * Msb, K:) and has neither<br>\
dual nor pl.: (Msb:) or it has a pl., [though this<br>\
is not used in a pl. sense,] namely, شُمُوسٌ, (S,<br>\
K,) as though they called every part of it a شمس,<br>\
like as they said مَفَارِقُ for مَفْرِقٌ. (S.) When it<br>\
is made determinate without the article ال, [as]<br>\
in the name عَبْدُ شَمْسَ, meaning The Servant of<br>\
the Sun, (Msb, K,) i. e., of this luminous object,<br>\
(Msb,) the شمس of heaven, because they used<br>\
to worship it, (K,) it is imperfectly decl., (Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Alee, Msb, K,) because it is determinate and of<br>\
the fem. gender, (Aboo-&#39;Alee, K,) or because it is<br>\
a proper name and of the fem. gender and altered<br>\
from الشَّمْس: (Msb:) and a poet says,<br>\
كَلَّا وَشَمْسَ لَنَخْضِبَنَّهُمُ دَمًا<br>\
[Nay verily, by the sun, we will assuredly dye<br>\
them with blood], making شمس imperfectly decl.<br>\
because he means the art. ال to be understood:<br>\
(IAar, TA:) but some say that in the former<br>\
instance, (Msb, TA,) and in the latter, (TA,) the<br>\
word in question has a different signification,<br>\
which will be shown below: (Msb, TA:) and Sb<br>\
says that none of the Arabs made شمس determinate without the art. ال, except in the proper<br>\
name mentioned above, in which all of them made<br>\
it so. (TA.) The dim. is ↓ شُمَيْسَةٌ. (S, TA.) ―<br>\

(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (K, TA,) or شَمْسٌ, (Msb,) A<br>\
certain ancient idol. (Msb, K.) Accord. to Ibn-El-Kelbee, it is this that is meant by the proper<br>\
name mentioned above; and if so, it is perfectly<br>\
decl.: (Msb:) and some say that it is this also<br>\
that is meant in the words of the poet cited above,<br>\
and that he makes the word imperfectly decl.<br>\
because he uses it as a proper name of the image<br>\
(الصُّورَة). (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شَمْسٌ also signifies A kind of<br>\
necklace or collar: (S, K:) or a pendant, or suspended ornament, (مِعْلَاق,) of the necklace or collar<br>\
upon the neck: or the collar of a dog: (TA:) or<br>\
a kind of women&#39;s ornament: of the masc. gender:<br>\
(Lh, TA:) pl. شُمُوسٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A kind of<br>\

يَوْمٌ شَمِسٌ: see شَامِسٌ.<br>\

[see 1:]) or that will hardly remain still: (A:)<br>\
or that rebels against his rider: (Msb:) or that<br>\
