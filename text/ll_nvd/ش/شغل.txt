شَغَلَهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
شَغَلَ, (O, K, MS,)<br>\
inf. n. شَغْلٌ (Msb, K) and شُغْلٌ, (K,) the latter<br>\
on the authority of Sb, (TA,) He, or it, (a man,<br>\
S, or an affair, Msb,) busied him, occupied him,<br>\
or employed him; (K;) i. q. أَلْهَاهُ [signifying as<br>\
above; and particularly he, or it, busied him, &amp;c.,<br>\
so as to divert him from (عَنْ) something; or<br>\
diverted him from a thing by busying him, &amp;c.]:<br>\
(S and Msb and K in art. لهو, and Bd and Jel in<br>\
xv. 3, &amp;c.:) [↓ شغّلهُ signifies he, or it, busied<br>\
him, &amp;c., much; i. e.] with teshdeed it denotes<br>\
muchness: (Bd in xlviii. 11:) ↓ اشغلهُ is a good<br>\
dial. var. of شَغَلَهُ; or is rare; or bad: (K:)<br>\
accord. to IDrd [and J], (O,) one should not say<br>\
أَشْغَلْتُهُ; (S, O;) for it is bad: (S:) accord. to IF,<br>\
they scarcely ever say أَشْغَلْتُ, [thus in the O, but<br>\
in the Msb ↓ اِشْتَغَلَ,] but it is allowable: (O:)<br>\
none of the leading lexicologists is known to have<br>\
pronounced it good. (TA.) [Hence the saying,<br>\
شَغَلَتْ سَعَاتِى جَدْوَاىَ (see art. سعو and سعى),<br>\
or, as some relate it, شغلت شِعَابِى جدواى (see<br>\
art. شعب).] See another ex. voce شَاغِلٌ. One<br>\
says also شُغِلَ بِهِ, (Msb, K,) meaning تَلَهَّى [i. e.<br>\
He was, or became, busied, &amp;c., by it], (Msb,)<br>\
and به ↓ اشتغل [meaning the same]; (Az, Msb,<br>\
K;) and شُغِلْتُ عَنْكَ بِكَذَا [I was, or became,<br>\
busied, &amp;c., so as to be diverted from thee, by such<br>\
a thing], (S, O,) and ↓ اِشْتَغَلْتُ [in the same<br>\
sense]: (S:) and عَنْهُ ↓ تشاغل, (TA,) which likewise signifies تَلَهَّى [meaning as expl. above, or<br>\
he busied himself, &amp;c., so as to divert himself<br>\
from him, or it]: (TA in art. لهو, and Bd and<br>\
Jel in lxxx. 10:) some disallow ↓ اِشْتَغَلَ, in the<br>\
form of an active verb, but say اُشْتُغِلَ, in the form<br>\
of a pass. verb; but it is originally quasi-pass of<br>\
أَشْغَلْتُهُ, like as are اِحْتَرَقَ and اِكْتَهَلَ of أَحْرَقْتُهُ<br>\
and أَكْهَلْتُهُ; [though why of أَشْغَلْتُهُ rather than<br>\
of شَغَلْتُهُ, I do not see:] Az mentions the usage<br>\
of its act. and pass. part. ns.: (Msb:) accord. to<br>\
AHát and IDrd, one should not say ↓ اِشْتَغَلَ;<br>\
but IF mentions, as transmitted from the Arabs,<br>\
اُشْتُغِلَ فُلَانٌ بِالشَّىْءِ, and the pass. part. n. (O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, نَحْنُ نَشْغَلُ عَنْكَ المَرْتَعَ (assumed tropical:)  [We<br>\
occupy the place of pasturage so as to keep it<br>\
from thee], and المَآءَ [the water]; meaning, it is<br>\
sufficient for us without being more than sufficient.<br>\
(S in art. شفه.) And شُغِلَ عَنْكَ مَا عِنْدَنَا (assumed tropical:)  [What<br>\
we had was employed so as to be kept from thee].<br>\
(JK in that art.)<br>\
2<br>\
شَغَّلَ see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
اشغلهُ: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  مَا أَشْغَلَهُ [meaning How<br>\
much is he busied! &amp;c.], (Th, S, K,) denoting<br>\
wonder, (Th, TA,) is anomalous, because one<br>\
does not [regularly] form a verb of wonder from<br>\
one in the form of a pass. verb. (Th, S, K.)<br>\
6<br>\
تشاغل عَنْهُ: see 1. [Accord. to Golius,<br>\
تشاغلوا signifies They occupied one another, on<br>\
the authority of the KL; in which, however, I<br>\
find only تَشَاغُلٌ expl. as meaning خودرا بچيزى<br>\
مشغول كردن i. e. To make oneself busied, &amp;c.,<br>\
with a thing.]<br>\
8<br>\
إِشْتَغَلَ see 1, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also,<br>\
اِشْتَغَلَ فِيهِ السَّمُّ The poison crept into him, or<br>\
pervaded him; syn. سَرَى: and اشتغل فِيهِ الدَّوَآءُ<br>\
The medicine entered into him, and produced an<br>\
effect upon him, or showed its effect upon him;<br>\
syn. نَجَعَ. (TA.)<br>\
شَغْلٌ an inf. n. of 1. (K, Msb.) See the next<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  And see also شَغْلَةٌ.<br>\
شُغْلٌ and ↓ شَغْلٌ and ↓ شُغُلٌ (S, O, Msb, K)<br>\
and ↓ شَغَلٌ (S, O, K;) Business, occupation, or<br>\
employment; (PS;) contr. of فَرَاغٌ: (K:) [and<br>\
particularly business, &amp;c., that diverts one from a<br>\
thing:] or an occurrence that causes a man to<br>\
forget, or neglect, or be unmindful: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَشْغَالٌ (S, O, K) and [of<br>\
mult.] شُغُولٌ: (K:) شُغْلٌ is mentioned by Sb as<br>\
an instance of an inf. n. having a pl., namely,<br>\
أَشْغَالٌ; like عَقْلٌ and مَرَضٌ. (TA in art. مرض.)<br>\
[See also أُشْغُولَةٌ.]<br>\
شَغَلٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
شَغِلٌ Busy, or busied, occupied, or employed:<br>\
(K:) [and particularly busy, &amp;c, so as to be<br>\
diverted from a thing:] thought by ISd to be a<br>\
possessive epithet [meaning ذُو شُغْلٍ], because it<br>\
has no verb to which it is conformable: (TA:)<br>\
it is an epithet applied to a man, from الشَّغْلُ [or<br>\
الشُّغْلُ]: (IAar, in O:) and ↓ مَشْغُولٌ signifies the<br>\
same; (Msb, TA;) and ↓ مُشْتَغِلٌ (Az, Msb, K)<br>\
and ↓ مُشْتَغَلٌ, (Az, IF, O, Msb, K,) the latter<br>\
[said to be] extr. [meaning anomalous, for<br>\
اُشْتُغِلَ is not mentioned by F]. (K.)<br>\
شُغُلٌ: see شُغْلٌ.<br>\
شَغْلَةٌ Reaped grain or wheat, collected together,<br>\
in the place where it is trodden out; syn. بَيْدَرٌ<br>\
and كُدْسٌ (IAar, O, K) and عَرَمَةٌ; (IAar, O;)<br>\
as also ↓ شَغَلَةٌ: (IAth, TA:) pl. [or coll. gen. n.]<br>\
of the former ↓ شَغْلٌ, (O, K, TA, [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, شُغَلٌ,]) like as تَمْرٌ is of تَمْرَةٌ. (O,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
شَغَلَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
شَغَّالٌ signifies كَثِيرُ الشُّغْلِ [i. e. Having much<br>\
business or occupation or employment; or who<br>\
busies or occupies or employs himself much].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
شَاغِلٌ act. part. n. of شَغَلَهُ; [Busying, occupying, or employing; &amp;c.;] (S, Msb;) applied to a<br>\
man, (S,) or to an affair. (Msb.) [Hence,] one<br>\
says, عَنْكَ الشَّوَاغِلُ ↓ شَغَلَتْنِى [Busying affairs<br>\
busied me, or have busied me, so as to divert me<br>\
from thee]: the last word being pl. of شَاغِلٌ.<br>\
(TA.) شُغْلٌ شَاغِلٌ [lit. Busying business, or the<br>\
like,] has an intensive meaning: (K:) the latter<br>\
word in this case is a corroborative, as in لَيْلٌ<br>\
لَائِلٌ. (S.)<br>\
أَشْغَلُ [More, and most, busy &amp;c.]. أَشْغَلُ مِنْ<br>\
ذَاتِ النِّحْيَيْنِ [More busy than she who was the<br>\
owner of the two skins of butter] is a prov. [mentioned in the TA]: she was a woman of [the<br>\
tribe of] Teym-Allah: she used to sell clarified<br>\
butter, in the Time of Ignorance; and Khowwát<br>\
Ibn-Jubeyr El-Ansáree came to her, demanding<br>\
to buy clarified butter of her, and saw no one<br>\
with her, and he bargained with her: so she<br>\
untied a skin, and he looked at it: then he said<br>\
to her, “Hold thou it until I look at another: ”<br>\
and she said, “Untie thou another skin: ” and he<br>\
did so, and looked at it, and said, “I desire<br>\
other than this; therefore hold thou it: ” and she<br>\
did so: and when her hands were [thus] occupied,<br>\
he assaulted her, and she was unable to repel the<br>\
him. (Meyd.)<br>\
أُشْغُولَةٌ an instance of the measure أُفْعُولَةٌ from<br>\
الشُّغْلُ [similar to أُلْهُوَّةٌ and أُلْهِيَّةٌ, and to أُلْعُوبَةٌ,<br>\
&amp;c.; app. meaning A thing with which one is<br>\
busied, &amp;c.: and also syn. with شُغْلٌ]. (O, K.)<br>\
مَشْغَلَةٌ A thing that causes one to be busied,<br>\
&amp;c.: (K, * TA:) pl. مَشَاغِلُ. (TA.)<br>\
مَشْغُولٌ: see شَغِلٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] فُلَانٌ فَارِغٌ<br>\
مَشْغُولٌ Such a one is devoted to that which is<br>\
unprofitable. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And جَارِيَةٌ مَشْغُولَةٌ A<br>\
young woman having a husband. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
مَالٌ مَشْغُولٌ Property devoted to commerce.<br>\

شَغِىَ, aor.<br>\
1َ2َ3َ, inf. n. شَغًا, [signifies accord.<br>\
to some] He (a man) had a tooth, or teeth,<br>\
exceeding the other teeth: and [accord. to others,<br>\
agreeably with what is said to be the right<br>\
meaning of شَاغِيَة below,] he had a tooth, or<br>\
teeth, differing in the manner of growth from the<br>\
other teeth. (S.) [And] شَغِيَتِ السِّنُّ, aor.<br>\

other teeth: (Msb:) and [accord. to others]<br>\
(Msb) the tooth differed from the other teeth<br>\
(Msb, K, TA) in an absolute sense, (TA,) or in<br>\
respect of its place of growth, (Msb,) or in its<br>\
manner of growth, in length, and shortness, and<br>\
receding, and projecting: (K, TA:) or, accord. to<br>\
the A, شَغًا signifies the differing in respect of the<br>\
manner of growth and of collocation: or the<br>\
upper teeth&#39;s not falling upon the lower: (TA:)<br>\
or, as IF says, the advancing of the upper teeth<br>\
beyond the lower. (Msb.) The epithet applied<br>\
to a man is ↓ أَشْغَى; and to a woman, شَغْوَآءُ; and<br>\
the pl. is شُغْوٌ: (S, Msb:) [and] the epithet applied to a tooth is شَغْوَآءُ and شَغِيَآءُ; (K;) or<br>\
↓ شَاغِيَةٌ; (S, Msb;) which last is said by Az to<br>\
have two meanings; one whereof is exceeding [the<br>\
other teeth]; and the other, being longer and<br>\
larger, and differing in respect of the place [or<br>\
more probably the manner] of its growth from<br>\
those next to it: (Msb:) or, accord. to a marginal<br>\
note in the S, in the handwriting of Aboo-Zekereeyà, this signifies differing in the manner of<br>\
its growth from the manner of growth of the<br>\
others, whether exceeding or not exceeding: or,<br>\
accord. to a marginal note in the copy of Aboo-Sahl El-Harawee, crooked; not exceeding. (TA.)<br>\
