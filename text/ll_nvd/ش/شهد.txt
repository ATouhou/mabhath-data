شَهِدَ, (S, A, Mgh, L, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
شَهَدَ; (K;)<br>\
and شَهُدَ, aor.<br>\
شَهُدَ; (K;) also pronounced and written<br>\
شَهْدَ, (Akh, S, K,) and شِهْدَ, and شِهِدَ, accord. to<br>\
a rule applying to all verbs of the measure فَعِلَ of<br>\
which the medial radical letter is a faucial; (MF;)<br>\
inf. n. شَهَادَةٌ (S, A, Mgh, L, Msb, K) and شهد;<br>\
(TA;) [there written without any syll. sign, and<br>\
not found by me in any other Lex.;]) He told, or<br>\
gave information of, what he had witnessed, or<br>\
seen or beheld with his eye: (Mgh, L, Msb:) this<br>\
is the primary signification: (L:) he declared<br>\
what he knew: he gave testimony, attestation, or<br>\
evidence; he bore witness: (L:) he gave decisive<br>\
information. (S, A, L, K.) [See also شَهَادَةٌ below.] You say, شَهِدَ بِكَذَا, inf. n. as above, (S,<br>\
A, Mgh, L, Msb, K,) He told, or gave information of, such a thing, as having witnessed it, or<br>\
seen or beheld it with his eye; (Mgh, Msb;) or<br>\
declared such a thing as knowing it; (L;) or<br>\
gave his testimony, attestation, or evidence, respecting it; or bore witness of it, or to it; (S, A,<br>\
L, K;) عِنْدَ الحَاكِمِ [in the presence of the judge];<br>\
لِفُلَانٍ [for, or in favour of, such a one], (S,<br>\
Mgh, L, K,) and عَلَى فُلَانٍ [against, or in opposition to, such a one]. (Mgh.) And شَهِدَ عَلَى<br>\
كَذَا He gave decisive information [respecting<br>\
such a thing (as in the Kur xlvi. 9, and in many<br>\
other instances); he testified respecting it]. (S,<br>\
L. [See also another meaning of this phrase in<br>\
what follows.]) [Hence,] شَهِدَ اللّٰهُ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَاهَ إِلَّا هُوَ,<br>\
in the Kur [iii. 16], means God hath given<br>\
evidence that there is no deity but He: (Abu-l-<br>\
&#39;Abbás, IAmb, Jel:) or God knoweth &amp;c.; (Ah-<br>\
mad Ibn-Yahyà, K;) and so شَهِدَ اللّٰهُ throughout<br>\
the Kur-án: (Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà:) or God saith<br>\
&amp;c.: or God hath written &amp;c. (K.) And أَشْهَدُ<br>\
أَنْ لَا إِلَاهَ إِلَّااللّٰهُ I know, (Msb, K,) [or acknowledge,] and I declare, [or testify, that there is no<br>\
deity but God:] (K:) [Fei says,] the verb is<br>\
trans. in this phrase by itself [i. e. without the<br>\
intervention of a prep.] because it is used in the<br>\
sense of أَعْلَمُ. (Msb.) [And hence, كَلِمَةُ الشَّهَادَةِ<br>\
means The sentence declaring that there is no<br>\
deity but God and that Mohammad is God&#39;s<br>\
apostle.] ―<br>\
-b2-  شَهِدَ بِاللّٰهِ, (Mgh, * Msb,) aor.<br>\
شَهَدَ, inf. n.<br>\
شَهَادَةٌ, (Mgh,) means He swore by God: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) and أَشْهَدُ بِكَذَا I swear by such a thing.<br>\
(S, K.) أَشْهَدُ بِاللّٰهِ لَقَدْ كَانَ كَذَا I swear by God<br>\
that such a thing happened, or took place, combines the meaning of witnessing with that of<br>\
swearing and that of informing at the time of<br>\
uttering these words; as though the speaker said,<br>\
I swear by God that I witnessed such a thing,<br>\
and now I inform of it. (Msb.) Accord. to<br>\
some, when one says only أَشْهَدُ, not adding بِاللّٰهِ,<br>\
it is an oath. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  شَهِدَ عَلَى كَذَا, a phrase<br>\
of which one meaning has been expl. above,<br>\
means also He became a witness (شَاهِد) of, or to,<br>\
such a thing; (S, K;) he had knowledge of such<br>\
a thing, and witnessed it, or saw it or beheld it<br>\
with his eye: (Msb:) and شَهِدَهُ, (Mgh, L,) inf. n.<br>\
شَهَادَةٌ, (L,) [likewise] signifies he witnessed it;<br>\
or saw, or beheld, it, or him, with his eye; (Mgh,<br>\
L;) and (Mgh, L, Msb) so ↓ شاهدهُ, (A, Mgh, L,<br>\
Msb, K,) inf. n. مُشَاهَدَةٌ. (S, A, L, Msb.) [Hence,]<br>\
one says, مِنْهُ حَالٌ جَمِيلَةٌ ↓ شُوهِدَتْ [A comely, or<br>\
pleasing, state, or condition, of him was witnessed]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And شَهِدَهُ, (aor.<br>\
شَهَدَ, K,) inf. n.<br>\
شُهُودٌ, He was, or became, present at it, or in it;<br>\
(S, A, Mgh, L, Msb, * K;) namely, a place,<br>\
(Mgh,) or an assembly. (Msb.) Hence the<br>\
saying, (Msb,) فَمَنْ شَهِدَ مِنْكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ, in the<br>\
Kur [ii. 181], Therefore whosoever of you shall<br>\
be present in the month, and stationary, not<br>\
journeying, he shall fast therein (Mgh, Msb) as<br>\
long as he shall remain present and stationary:<br>\
(Msb:) الشهر being here in the accus. case as an<br>\
adv. n. of time. (Mgh, Msb.) [And hence,]<br>\
شَهِدَ الجُمْعَةَ He attained to [the being present at]<br>\
the جُمْعَة [here meaning, as in many other instances, the prayer of Friday]: (Mgh:) and<br>\
شَهِدَ العِيدَ he attained to [the being present at] the<br>\
عِيد [or festival, or the prayer thereof]. (Msb.)<br>\
[Hence also,] it is said in a trad., يَشْهَدُ بَيْعَكُمُ<br>\
الحَلِفُ وَاللَّغْوُ [Swearing, and unprofitable speech,<br>\
attend your selling]. (TA in art. شوب: see 1 in<br>\
that art.)<br>\

شَهَّدَ see 4.<br>\
3<br>\
شَاْهَدَ see 1, latter half, in two places.<br>\
4<br>\
أَشْهَدْتُهُ عَلَى كَذَا I made him to be a witness (شَاهِد) of, or to such a thing: (S, Mgh, L:)<br>\
[and in like manner,] أَشْهَدْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ I made him<br>\
to have knowledge of the thing, and to witness it,<br>\
or see it or behold it with his eye. (Msb.) See<br>\
also 10. إِشْهَادٌ in relation to criminal matters<br>\
means [The causing one to take notice of a thing<br>\
that threatens to occasion some injury, with a<br>\
view to the prevention of such injury; as, for<br>\
instance,] the saying to the owner of a house,<br>\
“ This thy wall is leaning, therefore demolish it,”<br>\
or “ feared, therefore repair it. ” (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
اشهدهُ also signifies He caused him to be present.<br>\
(K.) You say, أَشْهَدَنِى إِمْلَاكَهُ He caused me<br>\
to be present [at, or on the occasion of, his being<br>\
put in possession]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أُشْهِدَ: see 10.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
اشهد [as intrans.] (assumed tropical:)  Humorem tenuem e pene<br>\
emisit vir propter lusum amatorium vel osculum;<br>\
(S, K;) as also ↓ شهّد, (K,) inf. n. تَشْهِيدٌ: (TA:)<br>\
[from شَهْدٌ signifying “ honey; ” for] عُسَيْلَةٌ is a<br>\
term for مَذْىٌ. (S.) (assumed tropical:)  He rendered his مِئْزَر [or<br>\
waist-wrapper] of a reddish hue and of a dark<br>\
dust-colour (أَخْضَر) [by the act above-mentioned].<br>\
(L.) (assumed tropical:)  He (a boy) attained to puberty. (Th,<br>\
TA.) And اشهدت She (a girl) menstruated:<br>\
and attained to puberty. (K.)<br>\
5<br>\
التَّشَهُّدُ in prayer is well known; (S, K;)<br>\
The reciting of the form of words commencing<br>\
with التَّحِيَّاتُ لِلّٰهِ: [see art. حى:] from the occurrence therein of the words أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَاهَ إِلَّا اللّٰهُ<br>\
وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ. (Mgh, * TA. [See<br>\
also Har p. 611.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تَشَهَّدَ also signifies He<br>\
sought, or desired to obtain, martyrdom. (L.)<br>\
10<br>\
استشهدهُ He asked him, or required him,<br>\
to tell what he had witnessed, or seen or beheld<br>\
with his eye; to declare what he knew; to give<br>\
testimony, or evidence; to bear witness; or to<br>\
give decisive information. (S, Mgh, L, Msb, K.)<br>\
You say, اِسْتَشْهَدْتُ فُلَانًا عَلَى فُلَانٍ I asked, or<br>\
required, [or cited, or summoned,] such a one to<br>\
give his testimony, or evidence, or to bear witness,<br>\
against such a one. (L.) And اِسْتَشْهَدْتُ الرَّجُلَ<br>\
عَلَى إِقْرَارِ الغَرِيمِ and ↓ أَشْهَدْتُهُ I asked, or required, [&amp;c., and made,] the man to bear witness<br>\
to, or to be witness of or to, the confession, or<br>\
acknowledgment, of the debtor. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
استشهد بِبَيْتٍ عَلَى مَعْنَى كَلِمَةٍ [He adduced, or<br>\
urged, or cited, a verse as an evidential example<br>\
of the meaning of a word]. (A phrase of frequent<br>\
occurrence in the larger lexicons.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اُسْتُشْهِدَ (S,<br>\
K) and ↓ أُشْهِدَ (K) He was slain a martyr in the<br>\
cause of God&#39;s religion. (S, K. [See شَهِيدٌ.])<br>\
شَهْدٌ: see شَاهِدٌ, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-  Also, and<br>\
↓ شُهْدٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the former of the dial. of<br>\
Temeem, and the latter of the people of El-&#39;Áliyeh,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) Honey: (K:) or honey in its wax<br>\
[i. e. its comb]; (S, Msb;) honey not expressed<br>\
from its wax [or comb]: (TA:) pl. شِهَادٌ: (S,<br>\
Msb, K:) شَهْدَةٌ is a more particular term, (S,<br>\
K,) the n. un., [signifying a portion thereof; and<br>\
a honey-comb, or a portion of a honey-comb;] as<br>\
also شُهْدَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
شُهْدٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
شُهُودٌ: see شَاهِدٌ, in two places.<br>\
شَهِيدٌ is also written and pronounced شِهِيدٌ, with<br>\
kesr to the ش: (K, TA:) and in like manner is<br>\
every word of the measure فَعِيلٌ having a faucial<br>\
letter for its, medial radical, whether an epithet,<br>\
like this, or a subst., like رَغِيفٌ and بَعِيرٌ: ElHemdánee says, in the “ Iaráb el-Kur-án,” that<br>\
the people of El-Hijáz, and Benoo-Asad, say<br>\
رَحِيمٌ and رَغِيفٌ and بَعِيرٌ, with fet-h to the first<br>\
letter; and Keys and Rabee&#39;ah and Temeem say<br>\
رَحِيمٌ and رِغِيفٌ and بِعِيرٌ, with kesr to the first<br>\
letter: Sub says, in the R, that Temeem pronounce every فَعِيل of which the medial radical<br>\
letter is hemzeh or any other faucial with kesr to<br>\
the first letter: and En-Nawawee states, on the<br>\
authority of Lth, that some of the Arabs do the<br>\
same when the medial radical letter is not a faucial; as in كبير and كريم and جليل and the<br>\
like thereof. (TA.) [This last pronunciation obtains extensively in the present day: and so, in<br>\
similar cases, does the intermediate pronunciation<br>\
termed إِمَالَةُ الفَتْحِ, (i. e. the pronouncing fet-h<br>\
like “ e ” in the English word “ bed,”) which<br>\
may be justly regarded as the best to be followed<br>\
because intermediate and because sanctioned by<br>\
the usage of the classical times, except in cases<br>\
that are pointed out by the grammarians as presenting obstacles to the pronunciation thus termed.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  شَهِيدٌ is syn. with شَاهِدٌ [in several senses, as<br>\
shown below]: and its pl. is شُهَدَآءُ. (S, K.) See<br>\
شَاهِدٌ, in six places. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Possessing much<br>\
knowledge with respect to external things: خَبِيرٌ<br>\
is used in the like sense with respect to internal<br>\
things; and عَلِيمٌ, in the like sense absolutely.<br>\
(L.) [Hence, perhaps,] وَادْعُوا شُهَدآءَكُمْ, in the<br>\
Kur ii. 21, [as though meaning And call ye to<br>\
your aid those of you who possess much knowledge: or] the meaning here is, your helpers:<br>\
(Bd:) or your gods whom ye worship. (Jel.)<br>\
الشَّهِيدُ as a name of God means The Faithful, or<br>\
Trusty, in his testimony (Zj, L,) or in testimony:<br>\
(K:) and (Zj, K) as some say, (Zj,) He from<br>\
whose knowledge nothing is hidden; the Omniscient. (Zj, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, derived from الشَّهَادَةُ,<br>\
or from المُشَاهَدَةُ, or from الشُّهُودُ, [all inf. ns.,]<br>\
accord. to different opinions; (TA;) and of the<br>\
measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) or in the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ;<br>\
(TA;) A martyr who is slain in the cause of<br>\
God&#39;s religion; (S, K;) [i. e.] one who is slain by<br>\
unbelievers on a field of battle; (Msb;) one who<br>\
is slain fighting in the cause of God&#39;s religion:<br>\
(IAth:) so called because the angels of mercy are<br>\
present with him; (K;) because the angels are<br>\
present at the washing of his corpse, or at the<br>\
removal of his soul to Paradise: (Msb:) or because God and his angels are witnesses for him of<br>\
his title to a place in Paradise: (IAmb, Mgh, *<br>\
K:) or because he is one of those who shall be<br>\
required to bear witness on the day of resurrection, (K, TA,) with the Prophet, (TA,) against<br>\
the people of past times, (K, TA,) who charged<br>\
their prophets with falsehood: (TA:) or because<br>\
of his falling upon the ↓ شَاهِدَة, or ground: (K:)<br>\
or because he is still living, and present with his<br>\
Lord: (ISh, Mgh, K:) or because he witnesses.<br>\
or beholds, God&#39;s world of spirits and his world<br>\
of corporeal beings: (K, * TA:) [and several other<br>\
reasons are assigned for this appellation:] the<br>\
primary application is that expl. above: but it is<br>\
also applied by the Prophet to one who dies of<br>\
colic: one who is drowned: one who is burned to<br>\
death: one who is killed by a building falling to<br>\
ruin upon him: one who dies of pleurisy: (IAth,<br>\
L:) one who dies of plague, or pestilence: a<br>\
woman who dies in a state of pregnancy: (L:)<br>\
and to some others: (IAth:) the pl. is شُهَدَآءُ.<br>\
(A, Msb, K, &amp;c.)<br>\
شَهَادَةٌ [see 1:] Information of what one has<br>\
witnessed, or seen or beheld with his eye: (IF,<br>\
Mgh, L, Msb:) this is the primary signification:<br>\
(L:) said to be a subst. from المُشَاهَدَةُ: (Msb:)<br>\
declaration of what one knows: testimony, attestation, evidence, or witness: (L:) decisive<br>\
information. (S, A, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  An oath: pl.<br>\
شَهَادَاتٌ: so in the Kur xxiv. 6 [and 8]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Martyrdom in the cause of God&#39;s religion.<br>\
(S, K. [See شَهِيدٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also i. q. مَشْهَدٌ as expl.<br>\
below: see the latter word. ―<br>\
-b5-  [And it is used in<br>\
the sense of مُشَاهَدٌ: thus,]وَالشَّهَادَة الغَيْبِ عَالِمُ , in<br>\
the Kur vi. 73 &amp;c., means The Knower of what is<br>\
unseen and of what is seen. (Jel.)<br>\
شَهِيدَةٌ A roasted lamb: or [the kind of food<br>\
called] هَرِيسَة [q. v.]: pl. شِهَادٌ. (Har. p. 609.)<br>\
[<br>\
شَهَّادٌ Always present. (Freytag from the Deewán of the Hudhalees.)]<br>\
شَاهِدٌ (S, Mgh, L, K) and ↓ شَهِيدٌ (S, * Mgh, L)<br>\
One who tells, or gives information of, what he<br>\
has witnessed, or seen or beheld with his eye:<br>\
(Mgh, L:) one who declares what he knows: (L:)<br>\
one who knows, and declares what he knows:<br>\
(ISd, TA:) a witness, as meaning one who gives<br>\
testimony, or evidence; who bears witness: (S, *<br>\
L, K: *) [one who gives decisive information: (see 1,<br>\
first sentence:)] pl. of the former ↓ شَهْدٌ, (Akh,<br>\
S, K,) or [rather] this is a quasi-pl. n., (Sb, TA,)<br>\
like as صَحْبٌ is of صَاحِبٌ, and سَفْرٌ of سَافِرٌ, (S,)<br>\
but some disallow this; (TA;) and ↓ شُهُودٌ [but<br>\
see what is said of this in the latter half of the<br>\
paragraph] and أَشْهَادٌ are also pls. of شَاهِدٌ, (Mgh,<br>\
L,) or of شَهْدٌ: (S, K:) the pl. of ↓ شَهِيدٌ is شُهَدَآءُ.<br>\
(S, Mgh.) [Hence,] ↓ مَعَهَا سَائِقٌ وَشَهِيدٌ, in the<br>\
Kur 1. 20: see art. سوق. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence also] الشَّاهِدُ<br>\
a name of the Prophet; (K;) meaning The<br>\
witness against those to whom he has been sent.<br>\
(Jel in xxxiii. 44.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And شَاهِدٌ An angel: (S,<br>\
L, K:) or a guardian angel: (Mujáhid:) pl.<br>\
أَشْهَادٌ: or this means the prophets. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And The tongue: (S, L, K:) from the saying,<br>\
لِفُلَانٍ شَاهِدٌ حَسَنٌ Such a one has an elegant<br>\
diction. (L.) One says also, مَا لِفُلَانٍ رُوَآءٌ وَلَا شَاهِدٌ<br>\
Such a one has neither goodliness of aspect nor<br>\
tongue. (Aboo-Bekr, L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [As a conventional<br>\
term used in lexicology &amp;c.,] An evidential<br>\
example, generally poetical, of the form or meaning<br>\
of a word or phrase: pl. شَوَاهِدُ: the sciences that<br>\
require شَوَاهِد being those of اللُّغَة and الصَّرْف and<br>\
النَّحْو and المَعَانِى and البَيَان and البَدِيع and<br>\
العَرُوض and القَوَافِى. (MF on the خُطْبَة of the<br>\
K.) [One says, هٰذَا شَاهِدٌ لِكَذَا and عَلَى كَذَا<br>\
This is an evidential example of such a thing.]<br>\
With respect to the classical language, absolutely,<br>\
شواهد are taken, by universal consent, from the<br>\
Kur-án, and from the language [both verse and<br>\
prose (Kull p. 348)] of those Arabs who lived<br>\
before the period of the corruption [in any considerable degree] of the Arabic tongue: [see<br>\
مُوَلَّدٌ:] also, accord. to the general decision of the<br>\
learned, from the Traditions of Mohammad;<br>\
[which last source is excluded by some because<br>\
traditions may be corrupted in language by their<br>\
transmitters, and interpolated, and even forged;]<br>\
and electively from the language of those Arabs<br>\
who lived after the first corruption of the Arabic<br>\
tongue, but before the corruption had become extensive. (Mz, 1st نوع; and MF ubi suprà. [See,<br>\
again, مُوَلَّدٌ.]) The classes of the poets from<br>\
whose poetry شواهد are taken are the Pagan<br>\
Arabs, the Mukhadrams, the Islámees, and the<br>\
Muwelleds: [see جَاهِلِىٌّ and مُخَضْرَمٌ and إِسْلَامِىٌّ<br>\
and مُوَلَّدٌ:] with respect to all the sciences above<br>\
mentioned, they are taken from the poetry of the<br>\
first, second, and third, classes; from that of the<br>\
first and second by universal consent, and from<br>\
that of the third electively: (MF ubi suprá:) but<br>\
they are taken from the poetry of the fourth class<br>\
with respect only to the sciences of المَعَانِى and<br>\
البَيَان and البَدِيع. (Idem, and Kull p. 348.)<br>\
[The age of the earliest existing classical poems<br>\
(though some older fragments and couplets and<br>\
single verses have been preserved) is only about<br>\
a century before the birth of Mohammad: that of<br>\
the latest, about a century after his death. (See<br>\
the Preface to this work.)] ―<br>\
-b6-  Knowing,<br>\
(Msb,) and witnessing, or seeing or beholding<br>\
with his eye; a witness, as meaning an eyewitness; (L, Msb;) as also ↓ شَهِيدٌ: pl. of the<br>\
former [or, as is said in the L in art. مجد, of the<br>\
former or of the latter,] أَشْهَادٌ and شُهُودٌ; [but see<br>\
what is said of these pls. in the first sentence of<br>\
this paragraph;] and of the latter شُهَدَآءُ. (Msb.)<br>\
[See an ex. of ↓ شَهِيدٌ in this sense in a verse<br>\
cited voce رَبٌّ.] ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence, in the present day,<br>\
applied to A notary, who hears and writes and<br>\
attests cases to be submitted for judgment in the<br>\
court of a kádee.] ―<br>\
-b8-  Present; a witness as<br>\
meaning one personally present; (S, L, Msb, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ شَهِيدٌ: (Msb:) pl. of the former شُهَّدٌ (S,<br>\
L, K) [and أَشْهَادٌ, as above,] and ↓ شُهُودٌ, (K,) or<br>\
this last is used as a pl. but is originally an inf. n.<br>\
(S, L.) One says, الشَّاهِدُ يَرَى مَا لَا يَرَى الغَائِبُ,<br>\
meaning The present knows what the absent knows<br>\
not. (Msb.) And قَوْمٌ شُهُودٌ People, or persons,<br>\
present. (S, A.) And كَلَّمْتُهُ عَلَى رُؤُوسِ الأَشْهَادِ<br>\
[I spoke to him before witnesses, or persons<br>\
present]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b9-  [Hence, app., being opposed<br>\
to غَائِبٌ,] A running in which a horse exerts his<br>\
force unsparingly; (A, L;) as in the saying,<br>\
لِلْفَرَسِ غَائِبٌ وَشَاهِدٌ The horse has a run which he<br>\
reserves [for the time of need], and a run which<br>\
he performs unsparingly; like the saying, لَهُ<br>\
صَوْنٌ وَبَذْلٌ: (A: [see 1 in art. بذل:]) or شَاهِدٌ<br>\
means a running that testifies the excellence of a<br>\
horse, (IAar, K,) and his quality of outstripping<br>\
others. (IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  A star [app. when visible]; (Aboo-Eiyoob, K;) as being present and<br>\
apparent in the night. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  [Hence, accord.<br>\
to some,] صَلَاةُ الشَّاهِدِ The prayer of sunset; (A,<br>\
L, Msb, K;) because it is the prayer that is performed when the star becomes visible; (Sh, L;)<br>\
also called صَلَاةُ البَصَرِ, because the stars are seen<br>\
at the time thereof: or, accord. to some, the<br>\
prayer of daybreak; (L;) [and so, accord. to<br>\
some, صَلَاةُ البَصَرِ; (see art. بصر;)] as also ↓ المَشْهُودُ;<br>\
(TA;) and it is said to be so called because he<br>\
who is travelling must perform it without<br>\
abridging it, like him who is present at his home:<br>\
Aboo-Sa&#39;eed Ed-Dareer says that the former<br>\
prayer is so called for this reason [as is also said<br>\
in the A and Msb]: AM asserts that the first<br>\
reason assigned above is the right one, because<br>\
the prayer of daybreak, in like manner, may not<br>\
be abridged, and is not thus called; but it is thus<br>\
called by a poet. (L.) ―<br>\
-b12-  And الشَّاهِدُ is a name<br>\
