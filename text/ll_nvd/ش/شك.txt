شَكَّ is intrans. by itself, and trans. by means<br>\
of the particle فى: ―<br>\
-b2-  one says شَكَّ الأَمْرُ, aor.<br>\
يَشُكُّ [contr. to analogy in the case of an intrans.<br>\
verb of this class], inf. n. شَكٌّ, The thing, or case,<br>\
or affair, was, or became, dubious, or confused:<br>\
(Msb:) ―<br>\
-b3-  and شَكَّ فِيهِ, (MA, K,) first pers.<br>\
شَكَكْتُ فيه, (S, Msb,) aor. as above, (JM, PS,<br>\
&amp;c.,) and so the inf. n., (MA, &amp;c.,) He doubted,<br>\
wavered or vacillated in opinion, or was uncertain, respecting it; (MA, Msb, and so accord. to<br>\
explanations of شَكٌّ [q. v. infrà] in the S and<br>\
Msb and K &amp;c.;) syn. اِرْتَابَ; (Msb;) and<br>\
↓ تشكّك signifies the same. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  شَكَّ عَلَىَّ<br>\
الأَمْرُ means شَقَّ [i. e. The case, or affair, was<br>\
difficult, hard, distressing, &amp;c., to me]: (O, TA:)<br>\
or, as some say, [was such that] I doubted<br>\
(شَكَكْتُ) respecting it. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شَكَّ said of a<br>\
camel, (IAar, S, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
(S,) He limped, or halted; or had a slight lameness, (IAar, S, TA,) of his hind leg: (IAar,<br>\
TA:) or his arm stuck to his side, (K, TA,) and<br>\
he had a slight lameness in consequence thereof:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ اشتكّ, likewise said of a camel, he<br>\
had a slight lameness; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, TA;)<br>\
like شَكَّ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شَكٌّ also signifies<br>\
The cleaving or sticking [of a thing to another<br>\
thing]. (S, O, TA.) So in a verse of Aboo-Dahbal El-Jumahee cited voce يَلَبٌ. (S.) And<br>\
one says, شَكَّتِ الرَّحِمُ The relationship was, or<br>\
became, closely united. (O, TA. [See رَحِمٌ شَاكَّةٌ,<br>\
voce شَاكٌّ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  شَكَّ فِى السِّلَاحِ, (K, TA,) aor.<br>\
and inf. n. as above, (TA,) He put on [or around<br>\
him,] or attired himself with, the arms, or weapons, completely, not leaving any of them; (TA;)<br>\

-A3-<br>\
شَكَكْتُهُ بِالرُّمْحِ, (S, O, Msb, in the K شَكَّهُ,) and<br>\
بِالسَّهْمِ, and the like, aor. as above, (TA,) and so<br>\
the inf. n., (Msb, TA,) I pierced, or transpierced,<br>\
him, or it, (طَعَنْتُهُ, Msb, or خَزَقْتُهُ, O, and in like<br>\
manner in the TA, but in my copies of the S<br>\
خَرَقْتُهُ [meaning I made a hole in him, or it],<br>\
and thus in one place in the TA, and اِنْتَظَمْتُهُ, S<br>\
O, and in like manner in the K,) with the spear,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K,) and with the arrow, &amp;c.: (TA:)<br>\
but IDrd says that, accord. to some, شَكٌّ is only<br>\
by the conjoining two things with an arrow or a<br>\
spear: (O, TA:) [thus,] فَشَكَّ رِجْلَهُ مَعَ رِكَابِهِ<br>\
means And he clave and transpierced his leg, or<br>\
foot, together with his stirrup. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] شَكَكْتُ إِلَيْهِ البِلَادَ I traversed, or crossed,<br>\
or cut through, the countries, or districts, to him.<br>\
(O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And شُكَّ عَلَيِه الثَّوْبُ The garment<br>\
was put [or drawn] together upon him, and<br>\
fastened with a thorn or a wooden pin: or was<br>\
let down, or made to hang down, upon him. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  شَكُّوا بُيُوتَهُمْ They placed their tents in one<br>\
row, or series, (O, Msb, K,) in one regular order,<br>\
(T, TA,) near together. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Hence; شَكُّوا<br>\
الأَرْحَامَ They made the relationships to be closely<br>\
connected. (Msb.) And شُكَّ He was made, or<br>\
asserted, to be connected with the lineage of<br>\
another. (IAar, O.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And شَكَكْتُهُ said of anything means I drew and joined, or adjoined, it<br>\
[to another thing]. (Msb.) [And I infixed it<br>\
in, or thrust it into, another thing.] ―<br>\
-b7-  مَا شَكَّ<br>\
كَفِى خَلِيلُهَا, [or, more probably, ما شُكَّ,] a<br>\
phrase in a verse of El-Farezdak,] in which it<br>\
forms an apodosis,] means مَا قَارَنَ [i. e., app., Its<br>\
friend (the sword, or the spear, both of which<br>\
are meanings of الخَلِيل,) would not be conjoined<br>\
(or grasped) with my hand]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  شَكَّ<br>\
الثَّوْبَ He (the sewer) made the stitch-holes far<br>\
apart [in sewing the garment, or piece of cloth].<br>\
(O, TA.) [Thus the verb has two contr. meanings.]<br>\
-A4-  شَكِكْتُ إِلَيْهِ, with kesr, and شَكِكْتُهُ, (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O, and so in the K accord. to the TA, as<br>\
also in the TK, in the CK and in my MS. copy<br>\
of the K شَكَكْتُهُ and اليه,) I inclined to him, or<br>\
it; or trusted to, or relied upon, him, or it, so as<br>\
to be, or become, easy, or quiet, in mind; or<br>\
leaned, rested, or relied, upon him, or it; syn.<br>\
رَكَنْتُ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
شكّكنى فِيهِ, (S, O, K, *) inf. n. تَشْكِيكٌ, (O,)<br>\
He made me to doubt, to waver or vacillate in<br>\
opinion, or to be uncertain, respecting it; (S, K,<br>\
TA;) he threw me, or made me to fall, into<br>\
doubt, &amp;c., respecting it. (O.)<br>\

شَكٌّ [used as a subst.] signifies Doubt; (Msb;<br>\
[see 1;]) or the contr. of يَقِينٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
by which explanation is meant a wavering or<br>\
vacillation in opinion between two things, whether<br>\
they be equal [in probability] or such that one of<br>\
them outweighs [therein] the other; or, as the<br>\
expositors explain its meaning in the Kur x. 94,<br>\
uncertainty: (Msb:) or a wavering or vacillation in opinion, between two inconsistent things,<br>\
without making either of them to outweigh the<br>\
other in the estimation of him who conceives the<br>\
شَكّ: or, as some say, a pausing, or hesitation,<br>\
between two extremes that are equal [in probability], without the mind&#39;s inclining to either of<br>\
them: when one of them is made to outweigh,<br>\
without the other&#39;s being rejected, it is ظَنٌّ:<br>\
(KT:) accord. to Er-Rághib, it is the alternation,<br>\
or confusedness, of two inconsistent things, in the<br>\
judgment of a man, and their being equal: this is<br>\
sometimes because of there being two indications,<br>\
equal in his judgment, of the two inconsistent<br>\
things; or of there being no indication thereof:<br>\
and sometimes it relates to the question whether a<br>\
thing be, or be not; and sometimes, to the question<br>\
of what kind it is; and sometimes, to some of its<br>\
qualities; and sometimes, to the accident that is<br>\
the cause of its being: it is a species of جَهْل; but<br>\
is more special than this; for جهل is sometimes<br>\
the utter nonexistence of knowledge of the two<br>\
inconsistent things; so that every شكّ is جهل,<br>\
but every جهل is not شكّ: (TA:) accord. to<br>\
some, the primary meaning is a state of commotion, or disturbance, of the heart and mind:<br>\
(Msb:) pl. شُكُوكٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, يَوْمُ الشَّكِ<br>\
The day of which one doubts whether it be the<br>\
last of one month or the first of the next month:<br>\
and generally, whether it be the last of Shaabán<br>\
or the first of Ramadán; and to fast on this day<br>\
is forbidden.]<br>\
-A2-  Also A small crack in a bone.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A seam, or line of sewing, of a<br>\
garment. (L in art. صوح.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And accord. to<br>\
Freytag, A coat of mail composed of narrow<br>\
rings: but he names no authority for this.]<br>\
-A3-<br>\
And [Arsenic;] a certain medicament, that<br>\
destroys rats; brought from Khurásán, from the<br>\
mines of silver; (K, TA;) of two kinds, (TA,)<br>\
white and yellow; (K, TA;) now known by the<br>\
name of سَمُّ الفَأْرِ [ratsbane]. (TA.)<br>\

is put into the hole (خُرْت) [in which is inserted<br>\

says, ضَرَبُوا بُيُوتَهُمْ شِكَاكًا They pitched their tents<br>\

proportion, or beautiful, and slender; or light, or<br>\
active, in her work; and clever; is vulgar. (TA.)<br>\

instances,) or شُكِّىٌّ, (thus in the K, [but if this<br>\
were the right reading, the rule of the author<br>\
would require him to add “ with damm,” therefore I suppose it to have been mistranscribed in<br>\
an early copy of the K,]) applied to a لِجَام [i. e.<br>\
bit, or bridle], Difficult. (O, K.) [See also<br>\

الحَدِيدِ [a people, or party, completely clad in<br>\
sets of iron arms or weapons]. (S, O. [In one<br>\
of my copies of the S, بِالحَدِيدِ.]) [Accord. to<br>\
the TA, one says مِنْ قَوْمٍ شُكَّاكٍ ↓ رَجُلٌ شَكَّاكٌ: but<br>\
شَكَّاكٌ seems evidently to be a mistranscription for<br>\
شَاكٌّ. See also شَاكُ السِّلَاحِ and شَاكِى السِّلَاحِ in<br>\
arts. شوك and شكو.] ―<br>\

س, and with fet-h to the م; a word which I do<br>\
not find in any lexicon: it is said that] مسك<br>\
signifies a coat of mail narrow in the rings: and<br>\
the poet means, And of many an ample coat of<br>\
mail [narrow in the rings] have I rent open the<br>\
middle parts with the sword, from over a man<br>\

it was his duty to defend, who was pointed to as<br>\
