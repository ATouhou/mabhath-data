(S, L;) or a road in a valley: or in the upper,<br>\

[thus written in the L in this instance], as ISd<br>\
mentions on the authority of A&#39;Obeyd, but adding<br>\
that, as such, it is irregular, and that it is more<br>\
properly to be regarded as pl. of ↓ شَاجِنَةٌ. (L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, الحَدِيثُ ذُو شُجُونٍ, (S,<br>\
Meyd, L, K,) شُجُون being pl. of شَجْنٌ, with the<br>\
ج quiescent; (Meyd;) a prov., (Meyd, L,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  The story is involved, or intricate; (S,<br>\
Meyd, L;) or has several ways [in which it may<br>\
be understood]; (Meyd;) or has several modes,<br>\
or manners; and objects of aim: (L, K:) applied<br>\
to a story by which one calls to mind another:<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, Meyd, L:) the first who said it was<br>\
Dabbeh Ibn-Udd Ibn-Tábikhah: he had two<br>\
sons, named Saad and So&#39;eyd: and some camels<br>\
belonging to him ran away by night, so he sent<br>\
his two sons to seek them; and they separated;<br>\
and Saad found them and restored them; but<br>\
So&#39;eyd went on seeking them; and El-Hárith<br>\
Ibn-Kaab met him; and there were upon the<br>\
young man two [garments such as are called]<br>\
burds (بُرْدَانِ), which El-Hárith asked him to<br>\
give to him, but he refused to comply with his<br>\
desire; whereupon he slew him, and took his two<br>\
burds: and Dabbeh, when he saw a dark object<br>\
in the night, used to say, أَسَعْدٌ أَمْ سُعَيْدٌ [“ Is it<br>\
Saad or So&#39;eyd? ” (see سَعْدٌ)]; and this saying<br>\
of his became current as a prov.: some time after<br>\
this, having gone on pilgrimage, he met El-<br>\
Hárith Ibn-Kaab at &#39;Okádh, and saw upon him<br>\
the two burds of his son So&#39;eyd, and asked him<br>\
respecting them; and he answered that he had<br>\
met a young man wearing them, and slain him,<br>\
and taken them: Dabbeh said, “With this thy<br>\
sword? ” and he answered, “Yes: ” and he said,<br>\
“ Give it me that I may look at it, for I think it<br>\
to be sharp: ” and El-Hárith gave it him: and<br>\
he took it, and shook it, and said, إِنَّ الحَدِيثَ ذُو<br>\
شُجُونٍ; and slew him with it: whereupon it was<br>\
said to him, “O Dabbeh, in the sacred month? ”<br>\
and he said, سَبَقَ السَّيْفُ العَذْلَ [“ The sword preceded the censure ”): these three provs. he originated. (Meyd.)<br>\
شُجْنٌ and شِجْنٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
شَجَنٌ Grief, mourning, lamentation, sorrow,<br>\
sadness, or unhappiness; (S, L, K;) and anxiety:<br>\
(L, K:) pl. أَشْجَانٌ (S, L, K) and شُجُونٌ; (L,<br>\
K; [in the latter of which these pls. are mentioned after all the explanations of the sing.;])<br>\
the former a pl. of pauc., and the latter of mult.<br>\
(Ham p. 404.) [See a verse cited voce عَرَضٌ, in<br>\
which it means A cause of anxiety.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And The<br>\
soul&#39;s love, or its inclination, or its blamable inclination: (L:) [or] love that is followed by<br>\
anxiety and grief. (Kull p. 165.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A<br>\
want, (S, L, Msb, K,) as also ↓ شَجِينٌ, (L,)<br>\
wherever it be: (S, L, K:) pl. شُجُونٌ (S, L, Msb,<br>\
K) and أَشْجَانٌ; (L, Msb, K;) the latter being<br>\
pl. of شَجِينٌ also. (L.) A rájiz says,<br>\
لِى شَجَنَانِ شَجَنٌ بِنَجْدِ<br>\
وَشَجَنٌ لِى بِبِلَادِ السِّنْدِ<br>\
[I have two wants; a want in Nejd, and I have<br>\
a want in the country of Es-Sind]. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
An intricately-intermingling branch of a tree;<br>\
(L, K;) and a شُعْبَة [i. e. branch, or branchlet,<br>\
or the like,] of anything; (K;) like ↓ شِجْنَةٌ and<br>\
↓ شُجْنَةٌ and ↓ شَجْنَةٌ (L, K) in the former sense:<br>\
(L: [accord. to the K, app., in the latter sense:])<br>\
or, accord. to IAar, one says ↓ شُجْنَةٌ and ↓ شُجْنٌ<br>\
meaning a branch of a tree, [or the latter app.<br>\
means branches, for it seems to be a coll. gen. n.,]<br>\
and ↓ شِجْنَةٌ and ↓ شِجْنٌ, and [the pl. of ↓ شُجْنَةٌ<br>\
is] شُجْنَاتٌ and شُجُنَاتٌ: (L:) or, accord. to J,<br>\
(L,) ↓ شِجْنَةٌ and ↓ شُجْنَةٌ signify roots of trees intricately intermingling: (S, L:) [but] the primary signification of ↓ شِجْنَةٌ and ↓ شُجْنَةٌ is a<br>\
branchlet (a شُعْبَة of a غُصْن) of a tree: (L:) or<br>\
↓ شِجْنَةٌ signifies tangled, or luxuriant, or abundant and dense, trees. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also شِجْنَةٌ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And see شَجْنٌ. ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, (K,) or شجنة, (L,<br>\
[thus written without any syll. signs, perhaps fem.<br>\
of شَجَنٌ, i. e. شَجَنَةٌ, but it seems to be indicated<br>\
by the context in the L that it is ↓ شُجْنَةٌ,]) A<br>\
she-camel compact in make, of which the several<br>\
parts are interknit, one with another, (L, K, *)<br>\
like the parts of a tree. (L.)<br>\
شَجْنَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\

-A2-<br>\
Also, as some say, Leanness; or slenderness, and<br>\
leanness; or leanness, and lankness in the belly. (L.)<br>\

with kesr, (K,) or ↓ شَجَنٌ and ↓ شَجَنَةٌ, (L,) A<br>\
branchlet of a bunch of a grape-vine of which all<br>\
the grapes come to maturity. (L, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  شِجْنَةٌ<br>\
signifies also (assumed tropical:)  Relationship closely, or intimately,<br>\
connected. (L.) One says, بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَهُ شِجْنَةُ رَحِمٍ,<br>\
and رَحِمٍ ↓ شُجْنَةُ, (assumed tropical:)  Between me and him is a relationship closely, or intimately, connected. (S.)<br>\
And it is said in a trad., الرَّحِمُ شِجْنَةٌ مِنَ اللّٰهِ i. e.<br>\
(tropical:)  الرَّحِمُ is derived from الرَّحْمٰن: (S, L: [see<br>\
رَحِمٌ:]) or, accord. to AO, (L,) the meaning is,<br>\
[الرَّحِم is] relationship, from God, closely, or intimately, connected, like the roots of trees. (S,<br>\
L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A crack, or cleft, in a mountain.<br>\
(Lh, L, K.)<br>\
شَجَنَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
شَجُونُ ↓ شَاجِنَتِى is a saying of the Arabs like<br>\
their saying عَابِلَتِى عَبُولُ [i. e., app., My withholder is death, or shall be death alone; for<br>\
شَجَنَتْهُ شَجُونُ may be rendered Death withheld<br>\
him, like as عَبَلَتْهُ عَبُولُ is rendered “ death separated him ”]. (L.)<br>\
شَجِينٌ: see شَجَنٌ.<br>\
شَاجِنٌ Grieving, mourning, or lamenting; or<br>\

شَاجِنَةٌ [as a subst.]; pl. شَوَاجِنُ: see شَجْنٌ, in<br>\
five places.<br>\
