شَهَرَ, (S, K,) inf. n. شَهْرٌ<br>\
and شُهْرَةٌ; (S;) and ↓ شهّرهُ, (S, A, O, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَشْهِيرٌ; (S;) and ↓ اشتهرهُ; (S, K;) He made it<br>\
apparent, conspicuous, manifest, notorious, notable,<br>\
commonly known, or public: (S, O, MF:) or [it<br>\
generally means] he made it apparent, &amp;c., as<br>\
bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly; he exposed it as such; or rendered it notorious in a<br>\
bad sense, or infamous. (A, K.) You say, شَهَرْتُ<br>\
الحَدِيثَ, inf. n. as above, I divulged the story, or<br>\
discourse. (Msb.) And ↓ لِفُلَانٍ فَضِيلَةٌ اشْتَهَرَهَا<br>\
النَّاسُ [Such a one has an excellent quality which<br>\
the people have made commonly known]. (S.)<br>\
And شَهَرْتُهُ بَيْنَ النَّاسِ I rendered him conspicuous<br>\
[or notorious or celebrated or renowned] among<br>\
the people. (Msb.) And شَهَرْتُ زَيْدًا بِكَذَا and<br>\
↓ شهّرته [I rendered Zeyd conspicuous, notorious,<br>\
celebrated, or renowned, for such a thing];<br>\
(Mgh, * Msb;) [but] the latter has an intensive<br>\
signification: ↓ أَشْهَرْتُهُ, with ا, in the sense of<br>\
شَهَرْتُهُ, has not been transmitted: (Msb:) or is<br>\
not of established authority. (Mgh.) One says also,<br>\
شُهِرَ بِكَذَا, and ↓ اِشْتَهَرَ, [generally, but not always,<br>\
in a bad sense, meaning] He was rendered, or<br>\
became, notorious, or infamous, for such a thing:<br>\
(A:) the latter verb being intrans. as well as<br>\
trans. (TA.) And [hence one says,] ↓ اِشْتَهَرْتُ<br>\
فُلَانًا meaning (tropical:)  I held such a one in light, or<br>\
little, estimation, or in contempt, and exposed his<br>\
vices, faults, or evil qualities or actions. (A.) ―<br>\

Msb, TA) from its scabbard: (TA:) or he drew<br>\
his sword and raised it over the people; (A, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ شهّرهُ. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
شَهَّرَ see above, in three places. [In modern<br>\
Arabic, شهّر often signifies He paraded an offender as a public example; and it occurs in this<br>\
sense in the S and TA in art. بلس, &amp;c.: the<br>\
offender, in this case, is generally mounted upon<br>\
an ass or a camel, and often with his face towards<br>\
the animal&#39;s tail.]<br>\

or hireling, for [or by] the month: (Lh, K:) or<br>\
he made an engagement, or a contract, with him<br>\
for work or the like, by the month, or month by<br>\
month: (TA:) المُشَاهَرَةُ from الشَّهْرُ is like المُعَاوَمَةُ<br>\
from العَامُ. (S, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَشْهَرَ see 1.<br>\
-A2-  أَشْهَرْنَا, (S, Msb, * K,) inf. n. إِشْهَارٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) A month passed (lit. came) over us. (S,<br>\
Msb, * K.) And اشهر الصَّبِىُّ [The child became a<br>\
month old; or] a month passed (lit. came) over<br>\
the child: similar to أَحْوَلَ, (A,) or to أَحَالَ.<br>\
(Msb.) And اشهرت الدَّارُ The house became<br>\
altered, or changed, and months passed over it.<br>\
(TA in art. حول.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also We remained, stayed,<br>\
dwelt, or abode, a month in a place. (ISk, S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And We entered upon the month, i. e., the<br>\
lunar month. (Th, S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And اشهرت She (a<br>\

اشتهر It was, or became, apparent, conspicuous, manifest, notorious, notable, commonly<br>\
known, or public: (S:) or [it generally means] it<br>\

شَهْرٌ The new moon, when it appears: (IF, A,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, K:) so called because of its conspicuousness. (Mgh, Msb.) This is the original<br>\
signification. (Mgh.) [See the last sentence of<br>\
this paragraph.] You say, رَأَيْتُ الشَّهْرَ, meaning<br>\
I saw the new moon of the month. (Mgh.)<br>\
Hence it is said in a trad., صُومُوا الشَّهْرَ, meaning<br>\
Fast ye the first day of the lunar month. (Lh,<br>\
TA.) And hence the trad., إِنَّمَا الشَّهْرُ تِسْعٌ وَعِشْرُونَ,<br>\
meaning The utility of watching for the new<br>\
moon is on the nine and twentieth night. (L,<br>\
TA.) [Or the meaning is, that the lunar month<br>\
is a period of nine and twenty nights.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
The moon: or the moon when conspicuous, and<br>\
near to being full. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [A lunar month;]<br>\
a certain well-known number of days: so called<br>\
because made manifest by the moon: (ISd, K:)<br>\
an arabicized word; or, as some say, Arabic;<br>\
(Msb;) and so called because of its being manifest: (Msb, TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَشْهُرٌ (Msb, K)<br>\
and [of mult.] شُهُورٌ. (S, Msb, K.) The following<br>\
are the modern names of the months: 1. المُحَرَّمُ<br>\

3. رَبِيعٌ الأَوَّلُ: 4. رَبِيعٌ الآخِرُ [or الثَّانِى]: 5.<br>\
جُمَادَى الأُولَى: 6. جُمَادَى الآخِرَةُ [or الثَّانِيَةُ]:<br>\
7. رَجَبٌ [to which is often added the epithet<br>\
الأَصَمُّ, and that of الفَرْدُ]: 8. شَعْبَانُ [to which we<br>\
often find the epithet المُعَظَّمُ added, and sometimes that of الشَّرِيفُ]: 9. رَمَضَانُ [to which the<br>\
epithet المُبَارَكُ is appropriated]: 10. شَوَّالٌ [to<br>\
which the epithet المُكَرَّمُ is frequently added]:<br>\
11. ذُو القَعْدَةِ: and 12. ذُو الحِجَّةِ: [see the second<br>\
of the two tables in p. 1254:] and the following<br>\
are the names by which they were called by the<br>\
tribe of &#39;Ád, agreeably with the foregoing numeration: 1. مُؤْتَمِرٌ: 2. نَاجِرٌ: 3. خَوَّانٌ: 4. بُصَّانٌ<br>\
[q. v.]: 5. رُبَّى: 6. حَنِينٌ: 7. الأَصَمُّ: 8. عَاذِلٌ:<br>\
9. نَاتِقٌ: 10. وَعْلٌ: 11. وَرْنَةُ: and 12. بُرَكٌ [or<br>\
بُرَكُ?]. (Ibn-El-Kelbee, in TA, voce مُؤْتَمِرٌ.<br>\
[But authors differ respecting some of these names,<br>\
as will be seen in other articles.]) أَشْهُرٌ مَعْلُومَاتٌ,<br>\
said, in the Kur [ii. 193], to be the period of the<br>\
pilgrimage, for by الحَجُّ, which immediately<br>\
precedes, is meant وَقْتُ الحَجِّ, (Mgh, Msb,) or<br>\
زَمَانُ الحَجِّ, (Msb,) applies to Showwál and Dhul-Kaadeh and ten days of Dhu-l-Hijjeh, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) accord. to Aboo-Haneefeh (Mgh) and<br>\
most of the learned, part of Dhu-l-Hijjeh being<br>\
called a month tropically, as is often done by the<br>\
Arabs in similar cases, relating to time; for ex.<br>\
when they say, مَا رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْ يَوْمَانِ, the period of<br>\
separation having been a day and a part of a day:<br>\
(Msb:) or [and] nine days of Dhu-l-Hijjeh with the<br>\
night preceding the day of the sacrifice, accord. to<br>\
Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee: (Mgh:) or [and] all Dhu-l-Hijjeh,<br>\
accord. to Málik: (Mgh, Msb:) [in these two explanations the two months next preceding being<br>\
meant to be included:] or Showwál and Dhu-l-<br>\
Kaadeh and Dhu-l-Hijjeh and Moharram, accord.<br>\
to Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Shaabee. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
learned man: (O, K:) [because of his celebrity:]<br>\
pl. شُهُورٌ. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [And accord. to the K, it<br>\
signifies also The like of a nail-paring: but this<br>\
is app. a mistake, perhaps originating from a<br>\
mutilated transcript of what here follows:] a poet<br>\
says, describing camels,<br>\
أَبْدَأْنَ مِنْ نَجْدٍ عَلَى ثِقَةٍ<br>\
وَالشَّهْرُ مِثْلُ قُلَامَةِ الظُّفْرِ<br>\
[They went forth from Nejd in a state of confidence, the new moon being like the nail-paring].<br>\
(O.)<br>\
شُهْرَةٌ a subst. from الاِشْتِهَارُ, (Mgh,) signifying<br>\
The appearance, conspicuousness, manifestness,<br>\
notoriousness, notableness, or publicity, of a thing:<br>\
(S, O, Msb:) or [generally] its appearance, &amp;c.,<br>\
as bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly; its<br>\
notoriousness in a bad sense, or infamousness.<br>\
(A, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Any evil thing that exposes its author<br>\
to disgrace; any disgraceful, or shameful, thing;<br>\
a vice, or fault, or the like. (IAar, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\

one of the vilest or meanest kind: both of which<br>\
are forbidden. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [It is also used in the<br>\
sense of مَشْهُورٌ.] One says, جَعَلَهُ شُهْرَةً (tropical:)  [He<br>\
rendered him notorious, either in a bad or in a<br>\
good sense]. (A.) And صَارَ شُهْرَةً, (K in art. دول,)<br>\
i. e. مَشْهُورًا (assumed tropical:)  [He became notorious, &amp;c.]; said of<br>\
a man. (TK in that art.)<br>\
بِرْذَوْنٌ شِهْرِىٌّ A برذون [or hackney] between the<br>\
رَمَكَة [or mare of mean breed] and the horse of<br>\
generous breed: one says, لَمْ يَرْكَبِ الشِّهْرِيَّةَ and<br>\
الشَّهَارِىَ [He did not ride hackneys of the sort<br>\
above mentioned]: (A:) or شِهْرِيَّةٌ signifies بَرَاذِين<br>\
[or hackneys]; and its pl. is شَهَارٍ: (Mgh:) or a<br>\
sort of بَرَاذِين [or hackneys]; (Lth, O, K;) a<br>\
horse of which the dam is Arabian but not the<br>\
sire. (Lth, O.)<br>\
شَهِيرٌ: see مَشْهُورٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  شَهِيرَةٌ A woman, and a she-ass, broad (O, K) and bulky. (O.)<br>\

مَشْهُورٌ Of known place or station; (K;) well<br>\
known; well spoken of; celebrated; held in repute; reputable; notable; eminent; (O, K,<br>\
TA;) applied to a man; (O, TA;) as also ↓ شَهِيرٌ,<br>\
