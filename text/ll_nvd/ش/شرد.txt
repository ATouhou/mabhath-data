شَرَدَ, aor.<br>\
شَرُدَ, inf. n. شُرُودٌ (S, L, Msb, K) and<br>\
شِرَادٌ, (S, L, K,) or the latter is a simple subst.,<br>\
(Msb,) and شُرَادٌ (K) and شَرْدٌ, (L,) said of a<br>\
camel, (S, A, L, Msb,) and of a horse or the like,<br>\
(L,) He took fright, or shied, and fled, or ran<br>\
away at random; or became refractory, and<br>\
went away at random, or ran away, or broke<br>\
loose, and went hither and thither by reason of<br>\
his sprightliness; syn. نَفَرَ, (S, L, Msb, K,) and<br>\
نَدَّ: (Msb:) and [simply] he fled, or ran away;<br>\
said of a camel &amp;c. (Aboo-Bekr, TA.) The<br>\
saying of the Prophet, أَمَا يَشْرُدُ بِكَ بَعِيرُكَ (tropical:)  [Does<br>\
not thy camel take fright and run away with<br>\
thee?], addressed by him to Khowwát, who<br>\
answered, أَمَا مُنْذُ قَيَّدَهُ الإِسْلَامُ فَلَا [As to the<br>\
period since El-Islám shackled him, no], mentioned in the A, points to a story related of<br>\
Khowwát Ibn-Jubeyr, (TA,) that, being found<br>\
by the Prophet sitting by some strange women,<br>\
he endeavoured to excuse himself by saying that<br>\
he had a camel which took fright and ran away,<br>\
and he was seeking for something wherewith to<br>\
shackle him: the Prophet used afterwards to<br>\
taunt him by inquiring of him respecting the<br>\
running-away of his camel: what Kr says, and<br>\
J in the S [in art. نحى], is incorrect. (IAth,<br>\
L.) You say also, شَرَدَ عَنِّى فُلَانٌ Such a one<br>\
fled, or went away or aside or apart or to a distance, from me; syn. نَفَرَ. (A.) [Or] شَرَدَ said of<br>\

see 1]: (Msb:) or he drove him away, or expelled<br>\
him; (S, * L, K; *) as also ↓ اشردهُ; (L;) [and so<br>\
شرّد بِهِ; for] you say شَرَّدْتُهُ عَنٍّى and شَرَّدْتُ بِهِ<br>\
[I drove him away from me]. (A.) And تَشْرِيدٌ<br>\
signifies also The act of dispersing, or scattering.<br>\

[viii. 59], means Disperse thou, or scatter thou,<br>\
by them, those [who shall come] after them: (S,<br>\

away at random; &amp;c.: or a disposition thereto].<br>\
(Msb.) You say, of a camel, بِهِ شِرَادٌ [He has a<br>\
disposition to take fright, or shy, &amp;c.]. (A.)<br>\
شَرُودٌ: see شَارِدٌ, in five places.<br>\

or shy, &amp;c.: and] is applied to a male animal and<br>\
to a female: (L:) [the fem. of the former is with<br>\
ة:] pl. of the former شُرَّدٌ (A, * L) and ↓ شَرَدٌ, (S,<br>\
L, K,) [or rather this is a quasi-pl. n.,] like as<br>\
خَدَمٌ is of خَادِمٌ; (S, K;) [and the pl. of شَارِدَةٌ is<br>\
شُرَّدٌ and شَوَارِدُ;] and the pl. of ↓ شَرُودٌ is شُرُدٌ, like<br>\
