شمّر, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَشْمِيرٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
He raised, (S, Msb, K,) or tucked up, or contracted,<br>\
(A,) his garment, (Msb, K,) or his waist-wrapper,<br>\
(S,) [or his sleeve,] or his skirts. (A.) One says,<br>\
شمّر عَنْ سَاقِهِ [He raised, or tucked up, his garment, or waist-wrapper, or skirts, from his shank].<br>\
(S.) [And in like manner, ↓ تشمّر signifies He<br>\
raised, or tucked up, his garment, &amp;c.: for] one<br>\
says also, تشمّر عَنْ سَاعِدَيْهِ [He tucked up his<br>\
sleeves from his fore arms]. (TA.) It is said in<br>\
a prov., شَمَّرَ ذَيْلًا وَادَّرَعَ لَيْلًا i. e. [lit.] He contracted, or drew up, his [or a] skirt [and clad<br>\
himself with night as with a tunic]: (TA:) or<br>\
شَمِرْ ذَيْلًا وَادَّرِعْ لَيْلًا, meaning (tropical:)  Use thou prudence, or precaution, or good judgment, and<br>\
journey all the night. (S and K in art. درع.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He strove, or laboured, exerted himself or his power or ability, employed himself<br>\
vigorously or laboriously or with energy, or took<br>\
extraordinary pains, (AA, Msb, TA,) and was<br>\
quick, (AA, TA,) فِى الأَمْرِ [in the affair]; as<br>\
also ↓ شَمَرَ, inf. n. شَمْرٌ: (TA:) and فِى العِبَادَةِ [in<br>\
religious service]: (Msb:) and فِى سَيْرِهِ [in his<br>\
pace, or journeying]; like تَجَرَّدَ and اِنْجَرَدَ. (L<br>\
and TA in art. جرد.) Also, (K,) inf. n. as above;<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ شَمَرَ, (K,) aor.<br>\
شَمُرَ, inf. n. شَمْرٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ انشمر, and ↓ تشمّر; (K;) (assumed tropical:)  He passed along<br>\
striving, or exerting himself, or vigorously: or<br>\
he passed along with a proud and self-conceited<br>\
gait; (K;) [and] ↓ مَرَّ يَشْمُرُ, inf. n. as above, has<br>\
the latter meaning. (S.) And شمّر فِى الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
was, or became, light, or active, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
and quick, (Msb,) in, or for, the affair: (S,<br>\

TA,) and شمّر عَنْ سَاقِهِ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He was, or<br>\
became, light, or active, and he rose, or hastened,<br>\
to do the thing, or affair. (A, TA.) And شمّرت<br>\
الحَرْبُ and شمّرت عَنْ سَاقِهَا (tropical:)  [The war, or battle,<br>\
became vehement; like كَشَفَتْ عَنْ سَاقٍ]. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also He contracted a thing; syn. قَلَّصَ;<br>\
(TA;) [and so, perhaps, ↓ شَمَرَ; for] الشَّمْرُ signifies تَقْلِيصُ الشَّىْءِ, like التَّشْمِيرُ: (K:) [or the<br>\
author of the TA may have misunderstood this<br>\
explanation in the K, and the meaning may be it<br>\
(a thing) contracted, or became contracted; for<br>\
قَلَّصَ is trans. and also (like قَلَصَ) intrans.: that<br>\
شمّر has this latter meaning, whether it have also,<br>\
or have not, the former, is shown by the statement<br>\
that] one says, شَمَّرَتِ الشَّفَةُ meaning قَلَصَت [i. e.<br>\
The lip became contracted, or became contracted<br>\
upwards]: (M in art. قلص:) and ↓ تشمّر [in like<br>\
manner] signifies it (a thing) contracted, or became contracted; syn. تَقَلَّصَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also,<br>\
(inf. n. as above, As, S,) (tropical:)  He launched forth a<br>\
ship, or boat; let it go; let it take its course; (As,<br>\
IAar, S, A, K;) and in like manner, a hawk;<br>\
(A;) and he discharged, or shot, an arrow: (As,<br>\
IAar, S, A, Msb:) and hence, (As, S,) (tropical:)  he sent,<br>\
sent forth, or sent away, (As, S, M, A, K,) a<br>\
thing. (M, A.) [See also سَمَّرَ.] And شمّر الإِبِلَ,<br>\
inf. n. as above; (TA;) and ↓ اشمرها; (K;) (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
hastened the camels; made them to hasten; syn.<br>\
أَكْمَشَهَا, [which seems to be either syn. with, or a<br>\
mistranscription for, كَمَّشَهَا, (see سَمَّرَ,)] and<br>\
أَعْجَلَهَا. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And شَمَّرْتُ النَّخْلَ (tropical:)  I<br>\
cut off the fruit of the palm-trees; syn. صَرَمْتُهُ;<br>\
(A, TA;) or so ↓ شَمَرْتُهُ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,) [for]<br>\
الشَّمْرُ signifies صِرَامُ النَّخْلِ. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اشمر الإِبِلَ: see 2, last sentence but one. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\

the she-camel covered by him. (O, K.) ―<br>\

أَدْرَجَهُ. (O, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تشمّر: see 2, third sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
تشمّر لِلْأَمْرِ, (S, K,) or لِلْعَمَلِ (A,) and ↓ انشمر<br>\
لَلامر, (S,) (assumed tropical:)  He prepared himself (S, A, K) for<br>\
the affair, (S, K,) or for the work. (A.) [Freytag mentions اشمر للامر in a similar sense, “Paratus fuit ad rem peragendam,” as on the authority<br>\
of J; but I do not find it in the S,] ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 2<br>\
as syn. with 1 and 7.<br>\
-A2-  [Also, app., as quasipass. of 2, It (a garment, &amp;c., was, or became,<br>\
raised, or tucked up, or contracted; and so signifies ↓ انشمر.] ―<br>\
-b2-  See 2 again, in the latter part of<br>\
the paragraph.<br>\
7<br>\
انشمر: see 5, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2<br>\
as syn. with 1 and 5. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also He (a horse)<br>\
hastened, or went quickly. (S, O. [Accord. to<br>\
Freytag, the verb in this sense in the S is اشتمر;<br>\
but this is a mistake.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And i. q. مَضَى and<br>\
نَفَذَ [app. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  It, or he, acted with a<br>\
penetrative force  or energy (see شِمْرٌ and شَمَّرِىٌّ)];<br>\
