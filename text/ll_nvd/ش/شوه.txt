syn. with حُسْنٌ [app. as an inf. n., of which the<br>\

-b3-<br>\
Also, (K,) as an inf. n., (TK,) The neck&#39;s being<br>\
long, (K, TA,) and high, and the head&#39;s overtopping; whence ↓ أَشْوَهُ applied to a horse: (TA:)<br>\

two contr. meanings: (K:) one says, [app. of a<br>\
horse,] شَوِهَتْ عُنُقُهُ His neck was long [&amp;c.]: and<br>\
his neck was short: (TK:) or شَوَهٌ said of the neck<br>\
[of a horse] signifies the being extended: and said<br>\
of the شِدْق [or side of the mouth], the being wide,<br>\

inf. n. شَوْهٌ, (TA,) He smote such a one with the<br>\
[evil] eye; (K, TA;) as also ↓ اشاههُ: (TA in art.<br>\
شهو:) and in like manner, مَالَهُ [his cattle, or<br>\

vehemently therewith. (TA.) And عَلَىَّ ↓ لَا تُشَوِّهْ<br>\
Smite not thou me with an [evil] eye: (K:) or,<br>\
accord. to Abu-l-Mekárim this means say not,<br>\
How eloquent art thou! (Az, TA,) or say not,<br>\
How beautiful art thou! (ISk, S,) and so doing<br>\
smite me with the [evil] eye, or with an [evil] eye.<br>\
(ISk, Az, S, TA.) ↓ تشوّه signifies He practised<br>\
artifice to smite people with the evil eye. (JK.)<br>\
And one says, أَمْوَالَ النَّاسِ لِيُصِيبَهَا بِالعَيْنِ ↓ هُوَ يَتَشَوَّهُ<br>\
i. e. He raises his look towards the cattle, or possessions, of the people to smite them with the [evil]<br>\

الوُجُوهَ I rendered foul, unseemly, or ugly, the<br>\
faces. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And شَوَّهَ اللّٰهُ حُلُوقَكُمْ God rendered, or may God render, wide your throats, or<br>\
fauces. (TA.) ―<br>\

TA,) A sheep, or goat; [each and either, but more<br>\
commonly the former; see an instance voce<br>\
صُوفٌ;] i. e. one of what are termed غَنَم; (S, *<br>\
Msb, * K;) applied to the male and to the female;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) so that one says of the male, هٰذَا شَاةٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) which is said by Kh to be like the phrase<br>\
هٰذَا رَحْمَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّى; (Sb, TA;) and of the female,<br>\
هٰذِهِ شَاةٌ; and شَاةٌ ذَكَرٌ and شَاةٌ أُنْثَى: (Msb:) or it<br>\
may be [one] of sheep, and of goats, and of<br>\
gazelles or antelopes, and of the bovine kind [app.<br>\
of the wild bovine kind i. e. of bovine antelopes],<br>\
and of ostriches, and of wild asses; (K;) it is<br>\
applied to a wild bull by Tarafeh, in his saying,<br>\
كَسَامِعَتَىْ شَاةٍ بِحَوْمَلَ مُفْرَدِ<br>\
(S) i. e. Like the two ears of a wild bull, in<br>\
Howmal, solitary; the poet likening thereto the<br>\
ears of a she-camel in respect of sharpness and<br>\
erectness; (EM p. 76;) and likewise by Lebeed,<br>\
and by El-Farezdak: (IB, TA:) and it is also<br>\
applied to [a wild cow; (though said in the K in<br>\
art. شوى to signify the wild bull, specially the<br>\
male;) and hence, as being likened thereto,] (tropical:)  a<br>\
woman; (K, TA;) thus by El-Aashà; and thus<br>\
also by Antarah, in his saying,<br>\
يَا شَاةَ مَا قَنَصٍ لِمَنْ حَلَّتْ لَهُ<br>\
حَرُمَتْ عَلَىَّ وَلَيْتَهَا لَمْ تَحْرُمِ<br>\
(TA) O شاة [i. e. wild cow] of the chase (ما being<br>\
redundant) for him to whom she is lawful: she<br>\
has become forbidden to me, and would that she<br>\
were not forbidden: (EM p. 246:) pl. ↓ شَآءٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) originally شَاهٌ, (K,) used when they are<br>\
many in number, (S,) [but this is properly termed<br>\
a coll. gen. n.,] and شِيَاهٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) with<br>\
ه, which is used of a number from three to ten<br>\
[inclusive], for more than which it is with ت<br>\
[meaning ة, i. e. شَاةٌ, agreeably with a general<br>\
rule], (S,) and شِوَاهٌ, [the original of شِيَاهٌ,] (K,)<br>\
and ↓ شَوِىٌّ, (S, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
شَوًى,]) which is pl. of شَآءٌ, (S, TA,) or rather a<br>\
quasi-pl. n., originally شَوِيهٌ, the ه being changed<br>\
into ى like as it is in ذِى for ذِهْ, (TA,) and<br>\
أَشَاوِهُ, (K,) and ↓ شَيْهٌ, (so in copies of the K, [in<br>\
the TA said to be like عِنَبٌ, which is a mistake,<br>\
(perhaps for عَيْنٌ,) for it is there said to be a<br>\
quasi-pl. n., which could not be said if it were<br>\
شِيَهٌ,]) and ↓ شِيهٌ, (CK, [but this, which is another<br>\
quasi-pl. n., is not in my MS. copy of the K nor<br>\
in the TA,]) and ↓ شَيِّهٌ, (K,) originally شَيْوِهٌ, but<br>\
this, also, is a quasi-pl. n., (TA,) and ↓ شِيَةٌ also is<br>\
syn. with شَآءٌ: (IAar, K in art. شوى:) it has not<br>\
a pl. formed with ا and ت, [i. e. it has not for a<br>\
pl. شَاآتٌ,] whether it be used as a gen. n. or as a<br>\
proper name: (TA:) the dim. is ↓ شُوَيْهَةٌ. (S,<br>\
Msb.) The sing. is also used in the sense of the<br>\
pl., in the saying فُلَانٌ كَثِيرُ الشَّاةِ وَالبَعِيرِ [Such a<br>\
one is possessor of a large number of sheep or<br>\
goats, and of camels], because the article ال<br>\
denotes the genus. (S.) And it is said in a trad.<br>\
فَأَمَرَ لَهَا بِشِيَاهِ غَنَمٍ [And he ordered that sheep or<br>\
goats should be given to her]: شياه being prefixed<br>\
to غنم, governing it in the gen. case, for the sake<br>\
of distinction; because the Arabs [sometimes]<br>\
call an animal of the wild bovine kind شاة. (IAth,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الشَّاةُ is also the name of (assumed tropical:)  Certain small<br>\
stars (K in art. شوى) between القرحه [or الفرجة,<br>\
thus in the work of Kzw, in his descr. of Cepheus,<br>\
and there said to be the star in the breast of<br>\
Cepheus,] and الجَدْىُ [i. e. the pole-star]; (TA<br>\
in that art.;) [the same that are described by Kzw<br>\
as certain small stars, called by the Arabs الأَغْنَامُ,<br>\
between the legs of Cepheus and the star الجَدْىُ.]<br>\
شَاهُ البَصَرِ, and شَاهِى البَصَرِ: see شَائِهٌ.<br>\
شَوَهٌ an inf. n., of شَوِهَ. (Mgh, Msb, TA. [See 1,<br>\
in several places.])<br>\
-A2-  Also a subst. meaning<br>\
Unluckiness, or inauspiciousness, of a woman.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
شَيْهٌ and شِيهٌ and شِيَةٌ: see شَاةٌ.<br>\
شُوهَةٌ Remoteness: (K, TA:) and so بُوهَةٌ: one<br>\
says, in dispraise, شُوهَةً لَهُ وَبُوهَةً [i. e. بُعْدًا لَهُ, lit.<br>\
Remoteness to him! meaning may God alienate<br>\
him or estrange him, from good, or prosperity!<br>\
or, curse him!]. (TA.)<br>\
شَوِىٌّ, originally شَوِيهٌ: see شَاةٌ.<br>\
شُوَيْهَةٌ dim. of شَاةٌ, q. v. (S, Msb.)<br>\
شَائِهٌ Envying: pl. شُوَّهٌ: (As, Lh, TA:) or the<br>\
latter signifies persons practising artifice to smite<br>\
men with the [evil] eye. (JK.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And شَائِهُ البَصَرِ,<br>\
(JK, S, K,) and البَصَرِ ↓ شَاهُ, (JK, K,) and شَاهِى<br>\
البَصَرِ, (JK, TA, and S and K in art. شهو,) the<br>\
last formed by transposition from the first, (S in<br>\
art. شهو,) A man sharp of sight. (JK, S, K.)<br>\
شَائِىٌّ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
شَاهِىٌّ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
شَاوِىٌّ and ↓ شَاهِىٌّ A man possessing شَآء [meaning sheep or goats or both]: (K:) the former is<br>\
the rel. n. of شَآءٌ; and the latter, that of شَاةٌ: but<br>\
used as a proper name of a man, it is ↓ شَائِىٌّ, and,<br>\
if you will, شَاوِىٌّ. (S, TA. *)<br>\
شَيِّهٌ: see the next paragraph:<br>\
-A2-  and see شَاةٌ.<br>\

or ugly, (JK, Msb, K,) in face, (JK, K,) or in<br>\
aspect, (Msb,) and, as also ↓ شَيِّهٌ, of which the pl.<br>\

the masc. applied to a man, (Lth, S, TA,) and<br>\

smites quickly with the [evil] eye: (Lth, S, TA:)<br>\
or that smites people effectually with his, and her,<br>\
[evil] eye. (TA.) And أَشْوَهُ العَيْن Having an<br>\
evil eye. (Fr, TA in art. شزر.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The fem. is also<br>\
applied to a mare, (JK, T, S, K,) as an epithet of<br>\
commendation, but not the masc. to a horse,<br>\
meaning, it is said, Wide in the شِدْقَانِ [or two<br>\
