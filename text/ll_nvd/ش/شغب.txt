شَغَبَ عَلَيْهِمْ, (S, A, Msb, K,) and بِهِمْ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) and فِيهِمْ, (TA,) and شَغَبَهُمْ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) aor.<br>\
شَغَبَ, (A, Msb, K,) inf. n. شَغْبٌ, (S, * A, * K, *<br>\
TA,) with which شَغَبٌ is syn., (A, K,) a syn. sometimes used, (A,) or this latter is not allowable, (S,<br>\
K,) as some say, (K,) and is ascribed by IAth to the<br>\
vulgar, and said by El-Hareeree in the “ Durrat<br>\
el-Ghowwás ” to be a mistake, but IB says in the<br>\
commentaries on the “ Durrah ” that it is correct,<br>\
mentioned by IDrd, and MF says that it is<br>\
mentioned by IJ, as well as by Z in the A;<br>\
(TA;) and one says also شَغِبَ عليهم, [and it<br>\
seems to be implied that one says likewise شَغِبَ<br>\
بهم, and شَغِبَهُمْ,] aor. as above, (S, K,) inf. n.<br>\
شَغَبٌ; (S, TA;) but this latter form of the verb,<br>\
with kesr, is of weak authority; (S, * TA;)<br>\
[whence it seems that شَغَبٌ is correct as inf. n. of<br>\
شَغِبَ, but disallowed by some who knew not this<br>\
form of the verb;] He excited, or stirred up, (S,<br>\
A, Msb, K, TA,) [against them, or] among them,<br>\
(Msb,) evil, or mischief, (S, A, Msb, K, TA,) and<br>\
conflict, faction, sedition, or discord, and contention, or altercation, and opposition: (TA:) and [it<br>\
is said that] تَشْغِيبٌ is like شَغْبٌ signifying the exciting, or stirring up, evil, &amp;c.; (K, TA;) [but]<br>\
↓ شغّب, inf. n. تَشْغِيبٌ, signifies he excited, or<br>\
stirred up, evil, &amp;c., much, or often. (O.) A trad.<br>\
mentioned in [the first paragraph of] art. شعب is<br>\
quoted by IAth thus: مَا هٰذِهِ الفْتْيَا الَّتِى شَغَبَتْ<br>\
فِى النَّاسِ [What is this judicial decision which<br>\
has excited evil, &amp;c., among the people?]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [See also شَغْبٌ below.] ―<br>\
-b3-  The saying of<br>\
&#39;Amr Ibn-Kameeäh,<br>\
فَإِنْ تَشْغِبِى فَالشَّغْبُ مِنِّى سَجِيَّةٌ<br>\
means (tropical:)  And if thou oppose, or contravene, me,<br>\
and do that which is not agreeable to me, [know<br>\
that opposition, &amp;c., is a natural disposition of<br>\
mine; عَلَىَّ being understood after تشغبى, as appears from what here follows.] (TA. [See also<br>\
3, and 6.]) Accord. to El-Báhilee, ذَاتُ شَغْبٍ<br>\
[applied to a she-ass] means (tropical:)  Having the quality<br>\
of opposing or contravening [the male]: so in<br>\
the saying of El-&#39;Ajjáj,<br>\
كَأَنَّ تَحْتِى ذَاتَ شَغْبٍ سَمْحَجَا<br>\
قَوْدَآءَ لَا تَحْمِلُ إِلَّا مُخْدَجَا<br>\
(tropical:)  [As though beneath me were a she-ass] such as<br>\
opposes or contravenes [the male], long-bodied,<br>\
long-necked, [that would not bear in her womb<br>\
aught save a fœtus imperfectly formed;] meaning, لَا تُؤَاتِبهِ وَتَشْغَبُ عَلَيْهِ [i. e. that she (the<br>\
beast that he was riding) would not comply with<br>\
his desire, and was contravening him]. (TA.)<br>\
[Accord. to J,] ذَاتُ شَغْبٍ وَضِغْنٍ, [in the TA<br>\
وصغب, and so in a copy of the A, an evident<br>\
mistranscription,] applied to a she-ass that has<br>\
not conceived during a year or two years or some<br>\
years, means (tropical:)  Refractory, or incompliant, to<br>\
the strong, or bulky, male. (S: there expl. by the<br>\
words إِذَا وَحِمَتْ وَاسْتَصْعَبَتْ عَلَى الجَأْبِ [which<br>\
have been misunderstood by Golius, and rendered by him, and by Freytag after him, as applied to a woman, and meaning respuens maris<br>\
congressum, aut picâ laborans].) ―<br>\
-b4-  And شَغَبَ<br>\
signifies also (assumed tropical:)  He declined, or deviated, from the<br>\
right way or course: (Sh, TA:) or شَغَبَ عَنِ<br>\
الطَّرِيقِ, aor.<br>\
شَغَبَ, (K,) inf. n. شَغبٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
declined, or deviated, from the road or way. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
شَغَّبَ see 1, end of the first sentence.<br>\
3<br>\
شاغبهُ, (S, A, K, TA,) inf. n. مُشَاغَبَةٌ and<br>\
شِغَابٌ, (TA,) He acted with him in an evil<br>\
manner; treated him with enmity, or hostility;<br>\
contended in altercation with him; or did evil to<br>\
him, obliging him to do the like in return: (A,<br>\
K, TA:) he opposed, or contravened, him. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
طَلَبْتُ مِنْهُ كَذَا فَتَشَاغَبَ وَامْتَنَعَ (tropical:)  I sought,<br>\
or demanded, of him such a thing, and he manifested incompliance (تَعَاصَى), and refused. (A,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
شَغْبٌ inf. n. of شَغَبَ [q. v. passim]. (S, * A, *<br>\
K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Clamour, or a confusion of<br>\
cries or shouts or noises: (Ham p. 505:) or much<br>\
clamour and confused or indistinct speech, leading,<br>\
or conducing, to evil, or mischief. (Har p. 311.)<br>\
One says شَغْبُ الجُنْدِ [The clamour, &amp;c., of the<br>\
army]. (S, and Ham ubi suprà.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,<br>\
app., this word, or the next, is used by some postclassical writers as signifying The plaintive cry of<br>\
the بُلْبُل. (See De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Ar., sec. ed.,<br>\
iii. 500 — 502.)]<br>\
شَغَبٌ inf. n. of شَغِبَ [q. v.]. (S, TA.)<br>\
شَغِبٌ, (S, O, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\

the latter in an intensive sense, (TA,) and ↓ شِغَبٌّ,<br>\
