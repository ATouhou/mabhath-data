شَنَفْتُ إِلَى الشَّىْءِ, (S,) aor.<br>\
شَنِفَ, (O, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. شَنْفٌ, (S, O, K,) I looked in a state of opposition, or resistance, (فِى اعْتِرَاضٍ,) at the thing;<br>\
like شَفَنْتُ: (S, O: *) or الشَّنْفُ signifies the looking<br>\
at a thing, (O,) or the looking at a thing like him<br>\
who is opposing it, or resisting it, (كَالمُعْتَرِضِ عَلَيْهِ,<br>\
K, TA,) and the raising of the eyes in looking at<br>\
a thing, (TA,) like him who wonders at it, or<br>\
like him who dislikes it, or hates it; (O, K, TA;)<br>\
and so الشَّفْنُ, as AZ says. (TA.) [See also 2.]<br>\
-A2-  شَنِفَ لَهُ, (S, O, K,) and بِهِ also, or, correctly,<br>\
accord. to ISd, this verb is trans. in the sense<br>\
here next following without any particle, (TA,)<br>\
[but two exs. are cited in the O from trads. in<br>\
which it is trans. by means of ل,] aor.<br>\
شَنَفَ, (S, K,)<br>\
inf. n. شَنَفٌ, (S, O,) He hated him, (أَبْغَضَهُ,) and<br>\
met him in a morose manner: (S, O, K: [in the<br>\
K, the latter meaning is expressed by تَنَكَّرَهُ, for<br>\
تَنَكَّرَ لَهُ: in the S and O, the former meaning is<br>\
expressed as above, on the authority of ISk; and<br>\
it is also said that الشَّنْفُ is syn. with البُغْضُ and<br>\
التَّنَكُّرُ:] in the former of these two senses it is<br>\
like شَئِفَهُ, with ء: (S, O:) or الشنف [i. e. الشَّنَفُ]<br>\
is a subst. signifying vehemence of enmity. (Ham<br>\
p. 108.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And شَنِفَ لَهُ, (IAar, ISd, O, * K,<br>\
TA,) and بِهِ, (ISd, TA,) i. q. فَطِنَ [i. e. He<br>\
knew it; knew, had knowledge, or was cognizant,<br>\
of it; or knew it instinctively; &amp;c.]. (IAar, ISd,<br>\
O, K, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And شَنِفَ, (K, TA, [in the former<br>\
of which it is erroneously implied that the verb is<br>\
followed by لَهُ,]) His upper lip turned upwards;<br>\
(K, TA;) inf. n. شَنَفٌ; (TA;) or this is a subst.,<br>\
signifying a turning upwards of the upper lip:<br>\
so says AZ. (O.)<br>\
2<br>\
شَنَّفَهَا, inf. n. تَشْنِيفٌ, He adorned her (i. e.<br>\
a woman, S, or a girl, or young woman, O, K)<br>\
with the [ornament called] شَنْف; (S, O, K;) like<br>\
as one says, قَرَّطَهَا; (S, TA;) as also ↓ أَشْنَفَهَا.<br>\
(Zj, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] شَنَّفَ كَلَامَهُ وَقَرَّطَهُ (tropical:)  [He<br>\
adorned and embellished his language]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
شنّف إِلَيْهِ, inf. n. as above, He looked at him, or<br>\
it, from the outer corner of the eye. (Yaakoob,<br>\

5<br>\
تشنّفت She adorned herself with the [ornament called] شَنْف; (S, O, K;) like as one says,<br>\
تقرّطت. (S.)<br>\
شَنْفٌ (incorrectly pronounced with damm,<br>\
IDrd, O, K, i. e. شُنْفٌ, O, TA) The upper قُرْط<br>\
[i. e. ear-ring or ear-drop]: (S, O, K:) or a<br>\
pendant (مِعْلَاقٌ) in [or suspended from] the قُوف<br>\
[app. meaning the upper part, or perhaps, the<br>\
helix, in the CK erroneously written فَوْق,] of the<br>\
ear; (Lth, O, K;) and likewise such as is attached<br>\
to necklaces: (Lth, O:) or such as is suspended<br>\
from the upper part of the ear; what is suspended<br>\
from the lower part [or lobe] thereof being termed<br>\
قُرْطٌ; (IDrd, O, K;) or this latter is termed رُعْثَةٌ:<br>\
(IAar, TA:) or, as some say, i. q. قُرْطٌ: (TA:)<br>\
pl. [of mult.] شُنُوفٌ (IDrd, S, O, K) and [of<br>\
pauc.] أَشْنَافٌ. (TA.)<br>\
شَنِفٌ Hating, (S, O, K,) and meeting in a<br>\
morose manner. (K.) IB cites, as an ex.,<br>\
وَلَنْ تُدَاوِى عِلَّةَ القَلْبِ الشَّنِفْ<br>\
[And thou will not cure the hating heart]. (TA.)<br>\
شَفَةٌ شَنْفَآءُ [A lip, meaning an upper lip] turning<br>\
upwards: (O:) or شَاةٌ شَنْفَآءُ [A sheep or goat]<br>\
having the upper lip turning upwards. (TA.)<br>\
شَانِفٌ Turning away, or averse. (O, K.) One<br>\
says, مَا لِى أَرَاكَ شَانِفًا عَنِّى What ails me that I<br>\
see thee turning away, or averse, from me? (O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And إِنَّهُ لَشَانِفٌ عَنَّا بِأَنْفِهِ (tropical:)  Verily he is raising<br>\
his nose [in aversion] from us. (O, * K.)<br>\
مَشْنُوفَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A she-camel having a زِمَام [or noserein] attached to her. (AA, O, K.)<br>\
