شَحَوَ, (Ks,<br>\
TA,) or<br>\
شَحُوَ, (S,) inf. n. شَحْوٌ, (Ks, S, TA,) said<br>\
of a man, (TA,) He opened his mouth; (S, K,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ اشحى [or app., اشحى فَاهُ], (K,)<br>\
and فَاهُ ↓ شحّى, inf. n. تَشْحِيَةٌ. (TA.) شَحَا فَاهُ<br>\
[meaning as above] is also said of the ass when<br>\
about to bray. (TA.) And one says of the bit,<br>\
شَحَا فَمَ الدَّابَّةِ [It opened the mouth of the beast].<br>\
(TA.) [See also art. شحى.]<br>\
-A2-  And شَحَا فُوهُ,<br>\

شَحُوَ, (S,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) His<br>\
mouth opened; (S, K;) as also فوه ↓ شحّى;<br>\
(TA;) but one should not say اشحى فوه. (IAar,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And شَحَا, inf. n. as above, He stepped,<br>\
paced, or walked. (TA.) Hence it is related in a<br>\
trad. of &#39;Alee, that, having mentioned sedition, or<br>\
conflict and faction, or the like, he said to &#39;Ammár,<br>\
لَتَشْحُوَنَّ فِيهَا شَحْوًا لَا يُدْرِكُكَ الرَّجُلُ السَّرِيعُ,<br>\
meaning Thou shalt assuredly go [or step or pace]<br>\
quickly, and advance, therein [so that the swift<br>\
man shall not overtake thee]. (TA.) And it is<br>\
said that شَحَا فِيهِ signifies He went far; and<br>\
took a wide, or an ample, range; in it. (TA.<br>\

تشحّى, accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, primarily<br>\
signifies He took a wide, or an ample, range in<br>\
anything. (TA. [See also 1, last explanation.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] تشحّى عَلَيهِ He spread out, or<br>\
stretched out, his tongue, [or he gave wide range<br>\
to his tongue,] respecting him [or against him].<br>\
(K.)<br>\
شَحًا, (K,) thus with the short ا, (TA,) Wide;<br>\
applied to anything: and ↓ شَحْوَآءُ, applied to a<br>\
well, signifies the same: (K:) or the latter, thus<br>\
applied, wide in the head [or upper part]. (TA.)<br>\
شَحْوَةٌ A step, pace, or single act of stepping or<br>\
pacing. (S, K.) One says, فَرَسٌ بَعِيدُ الشَّحْوَةِ A<br>\

رَغِيبُ الشَّحْوَةِ (S in art. رغب) a horse wide of<br>\
step; that takes a large space of ground with his<br>\
legs. (TA: but there, الشَّحْوِ [which is the<br>\
inf. n.].) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] رَجُلٌ بَعِيدُ الشَّحْوَةِ فِى مَقَاصِدِهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [A man who strides along in his pursuits].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And إِنَآءٌ وَاسِعُ الشَّحْوَةِ i. e. (tropical:)  [A vessel<br>\
wide] in the interior. (TA.)<br>\
شحآء: see the next paragraph.<br>\
شَحْوَآءُ: see شَحًا. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A she-camel wide of<br>\
step: and it is said in a trad. that the Prophet<br>\
had a horse named ↓ الشحآء, thus related, with<br>\
medd, [app. الشَّحَآءُ, like الوَسَاعُ,] expl. as meaning<br>\
the wide of step: so says IAth. (TA.)<br>\
شَاحٍ [act. part. n. of 1: fem. شَاحِيَةٌ; pl. of the<br>\
latter شَوَاحٍ and شَاحِيَاتٌ]. One says, جَآءَتِ الخَيْلُ<br>\
شَوَاحِىَ The horses came opening their mouths:<br>\
(S, A, K, * TA:) and so أَقْبَلَتِ الخَيْلُ شَاحِيَاتٍ.<br>\
(M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And جَآءَنَا شَاحِيًا He came to us<br>\
stepping along. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  He came to us<br>\
without any want. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  الشَّوَاحِى is applied<br>\
by the vulgar to The large pieces of wood resembling columns: but [SM says,] I have not seen<br>\
any mention thereof in the [classical] language.<br>\
