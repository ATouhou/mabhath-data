poetry with the ا made movent, i. e. ↓ اِشْعَأَلَّ,<br>\
inf. n. اِشْعِيلَالٌ; (TA; [in my copy of the Mgh<br>\
written اِشْعِلَال;]) or ↓ اشعلّ, (S,) or this last also,<br>\

in the “ Khizánet el-Fik-h ” is ↓ الإِشْعَالُ, [expl.<br>\

the war; or made it to burn fiercely, or to rage];<br>\
and ↓ شَعَلْتُهَا; mentioned by Abu-l-&#39;Alà. (Ham<br>\

↓ مَا الحَرْبُ شُبَّتْ أَشْعَلُوا بِالشَّاعِلِ<br>\
(S, O, and Ham ubi suprà,) (assumed tropical:)  They are not persons in whom is no good, nor such as are not firm<br>\
on their horses: [when war is kindled,] they make<br>\
to burn fiercely, and excite, that which is slightly<br>\
burning: such may be the meaning; for it may<br>\
be that the ب in بالشاعل is pleonastically inserted,<br>\
and الشاعل may mean as above: or بالشاعل may<br>\
mean by him who makes it to burn fiercely, [as is<br>\
implied in the S and O,] or by that which does<br>\
so. (Ham.) ―<br>\

manner] one says اشعلوا الغَارَةَ (assumed tropical:)  [They spread, or<br>\

making a hostile, or predatory, incursion became<br>\
dispersed, or dispersed themselves. (S, K.) ―<br>\

having four legs (S, O, K) of wood, to which it<br>\
