شَرِبَ, (S, A, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
شَرَبَ, (A, K,) inf. n. شُرْبٌ<br>\
and شَرْبٌ (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and شِرْبٌ, (S, A, K,)<br>\
agreeably with three different readings of the Kur<br>\
lvi. 55, (S, TA,) the first of which (with damm)<br>\
is that generally obtaining, (Fr, TA,) and is the<br>\
only one admitted by Jaafar Ibn-Mohammad,<br>\
notwithstanding which the second form (with<br>\
fet-h) is said by MF to be the most chaste as well<br>\
as the most agreeable with analogy, (TA,) or the<br>\
second (with fet-h) is an inf. n., and the first is a<br>\
simple subst., (AO, S, Msb, K,) and so is the<br>\
third, (AO, S, K,) and مَشْرَبٌ, (S, K,) which is<br>\
also a n. of place [and of time], (S,) and تَشْرَابٌ,<br>\
(S K, TA,) a form used when muchness of the<br>\
act is meant, (TA,) and تِشْرَابٌ, which is anomalous, (TA voce بَيَّنَ, q. v.,) He drank, (KL,<br>\
PS, TK,) or he swallowed, syn. جَرِعَ, (A, K, [but<br>\
the former meaning is evidently intended by this<br>\
explanation, and such I shall assume to be the<br>\
case in giving the explanations of the derivatives in<br>\
the A and K. &amp;c.,]) water, &amp;c., (S,) or a liquid,<br>\
properly by sucking in, or sipping; and otherwise<br>\
tropically; (Msb;) [generally, gulping it; for]<br>\
you say, شَرِبَ المَآءَ فِى كَرَّةٍ [He drank the water<br>\
at once, or at a single draught]; and فِى ↓ تشرّبهُ<br>\
مُهْلَةٍ [He drank it leisurely, or gently, or slowly]:<br>\
(Mgh:) شُرْبٌ signifies the conveying to one&#39;s<br>\
inside, by means of his mouth, that in the case of<br>\
which chewing is not practicable: (KT:) [but]<br>\
Es-Sarakustee says, one does not say of a bird<br>\
شَرِبَ المَآءَ, but حَسَاهُ. (Msb.) In the saying of<br>\
Aboo-Dhu-eyb, describing clouds,<br>\
شَرِبْنَ بِمَآءِ البَحْرِ ثُمَّ تَرَفَّعَتْ<br>\
[which is evidently best rendered They drank of<br>\
the water of the sea, then rose aloft, agreeably<br>\
with what has been stated respecting بِ in the<br>\
sense of مِنْ in p. 143, it is said that] the ب is<br>\
redundant, or, as رَوِينَ is rendered trans. by<br>\
means of بِ, [though I do not think that this is<br>\
the case unless بِ be used as meaning “ by means<br>\
of,” and I do not remember to have met with an<br>\
instance of it,] شَرِبْنَ is thus rendered trans.<br>\
(TA.) [See a similar ex. in the 28th verse of the<br>\
Mo&#39;allakah of &#39;Antarah, EM p. 232. One says<br>\
also, شَرِبَ فِى إِنَآءٍ, meaning He drank out of a<br>\
vessel; agreeably with an explanation of مِشْرَبَةٌ,<br>\
in the S and K, as meaning إِنَآءٌ يُشْرَبُ فِيهِ.] And<br>\
one says, إِنِّى لَأَمْكُثُ اليَوْمَيْنِ مَا أَشْرَبُهُمَا مَآءً, meaning مَا أَشْرَبُ فِيهِمَا مَآءً [i. e. Verily I tarry the two<br>\
days not drinking in them water]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [شَرِبَ<br>\
الدَّوَآءَ, in the conventional language of the physicians, as is indicated in the Mgh, voce بَنْجٌ<br>\
(q. v.), on the phrase شَرِبَ البَنْجَ, and as is shown<br>\
in many instances in the K &amp;c., means He took,<br>\
i. e. swallowed, the medicine, whether fluid or<br>\
solid. ―<br>\
-b3-  And in the present day, they say, شَرِبَ<br>\
الدُّخَانَ, meaning He inhaled, properly imbibed,<br>\
smoke of tobacco; or he smoked tobacco, or the<br>\
tobacco.] ―<br>\
-b4-  One says of seed-produce, or corn,<br>\
when its culms have come forth, قَدْ شَرِبَ الزَّرْعُ<br>\
فِى القَصَبِ (assumed tropical:)  [The seed-produce, or corn, has<br>\
imbibed into the culms]: (O, TA:) and when the<br>\
sap (المَآء) has come into it, شَرِبَ قَصَبُ الزَّرْعِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The culms of the seed-produce, or corn, have<br>\
imbibed]. (TA.) And one says, شَرِبَ السُّنْبُلُ<br>\
الدَّقِيقَ (tropical:)  [The ears of corn imbibed the farina; or]<br>\
became pervaded by the farina; (En-Nadr, A,<br>\
O;) or had in them the alimentary substance;<br>\
as though the farina were water which they<br>\
drank. (TA.) And وَقَدْ شَرِبَ الزَّرْعُ الدَّقِيقَ, occurring in the story of Ohod, (O, TA,) as some<br>\
relate it, or ↓ شُرِّبَ as others relate it, means<br>\
(tropical:)  [And the seed-produce, or corn, had imbibed, or<br>\
had been made to imbibe, the farina, or] had<br>\
become hardened in its grain, and near to maturity. (TA.) [And ↓ أُشْرِبَ means the same:<br>\
for one says,] أُشْرِبَ الزَّرْعُ (tropical:)  [The seed-produce, or<br>\
corn, was made to imbibe the farina; or] became<br>\
pervaded by the farina: and in like manner,<br>\
أُشْرِبَ الزَّرْعُ الدَّقِيقَ, i. e. (tropical:)  [The seed-produce, or<br>\
corn, was made to imbibe the farina, or] its<br>\
alimentary substance. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  One also says,<br>\
أَكَلَ غَنَمِى وَشَرِبَهَا (tropical:)  [He ate the flesh of my sheep,<br>\
or goats, and drank the milk of them]. (TA in<br>\
art. اكل.) And [in like manner] أَكَلَ فُلَانٌ مَالِى<br>\
وَشَرِبَهُ (tropical:)  [Such a one fed upon, devoured, or consumed,<br>\
my property]. (A.) And أَكَلَ عَلَيْهِ الدَّهْرُ وَشَرِبَ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Time wasted him, or wore him away; as though<br>\
it fed upon him]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And مَا لَمْ ↓ أَشْرَبْتَنِى<br>\
أَشْرَبْ [lit. Thou hast made me to drink what I<br>\
have not drunk,] meaning (tropical:)  thou hast charged<br>\
against me, or accused me of doing, what I have<br>\
not done; (S, A, K;) like أَكَّلْتَنِى مَا لَمْ آكُلْ.<br>\
(S in art. اكل.) ―<br>\
-b7-  شَرِبَ also signifies He was,<br>\
or became, satisfied with drinking: (TA:) and in<br>\
like manner شَرِبَت is said of camels. (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
S, TA.) And He was, or became, thirsty; (K,<br>\
TA;) thus having two contr. significations; (TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ أَشْرَبَ. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Also, and ↓ أَشْرَبَ,<br>\
His camels were, or became, satisfied with drinking: and, i. e. both these verbs, his camels were,<br>\
or became, thirsty: (K, TA:) or the former verb<br>\
signifies, or signifies also, (accord. to different<br>\
copies of the K,) his camel was, or became, weak.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شَرِبَ بِهِ, and بِهِ ↓ أَشْرَبَ, He lied<br>\
against him. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  شَرَبَ, aor.<br>\
شَرُبَ, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. شَرْبٌ, (O, TA,) He understood: (O, K,<br>\
TA:) on the authority of AA. (TA.) [In a<br>\
copy of the A, the verb in this sense is written<br>\
شَرِبَ; and app. not through the fault of the<br>\
transcriber, for it is there mentioned as tropical:<br>\
but in the O, it is said to be like كَتَبَ, aor.<br>\
شَرُبَ,<br>\
inf. n. كَتْبٌ; and in the K, to be like نَصَرَ.] One<br>\
says, شَرَبَ مَا أُلْقِىَ إِلَيْهِ, i. e. He understood [what<br>\
was told to him]. (TA.) And one says to a<br>\
stupid person, اُحْلُبْ ثُمَّ اشْرُبْ Kneel thou; then<br>\
understand. (O, TA. See also 1 in art. حلب.)<br>\
2<br>\
شَرَّبَ [شرّبهُ, inf. n. تَشْرِيبٌ, He made him to drink<br>\
water &amp;c.; and so, as is indicated in the S and K<br>\
&amp;c., and as is well known, ↓ أَشْرَبَهُ: and] شَرَّبْتُ<br>\
المَآءَ I gave to drink the water; as also ↓ أَشْرَبْتُهُ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, ظَلَّ مَالِى يُؤَكَّلُ<br>\
وَيُشَرَّبُ [lit. My cattle passed the day made to eat<br>\
and made to drink,] i. e. (assumed tropical:)  pasturing as they<br>\
pleased. (S, TA.) And شَرَّبَ مَالِى وَأَكَّلَهُ [lit.<br>\
He made people to drink my property, and made<br>\
them to eat it; or to drink the milk of my cattle,<br>\
and to eat the flesh thereof;] i. e. (assumed tropical:)  he fed people,<br>\
(S,) or gave people to drink and to eat, (TA,)<br>\
[of] my property, or cattle. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
شرّب الأَرْضَ وَالنَّخْلَ (assumed tropical:)  He gave drink to the land<br>\
and the palm-trees. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And شرّب لُقْمَةً<br>\
بِالدَّسَمِ (assumed tropical:)  [He imbued, or soaked, a morsel, or<br>\
mouthful, with grease, or gravy]. (TA in art.<br>\
روغ.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And شَرَّبْتُ القِرْبَةَ, (A &#39;Obeyd, S,) inf. n.<br>\
تَشْرِيبٌ, (A &#39;Obeyd, K,) (assumed tropical:)  I rendered the water-skin sweet; (K;) I put into the water-skin, it<br>\
being new, clay and water, in order to render its<br>\
savour sweet. (A &#39;Obeyd, S.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And شُرِّبَ الزَّرْعُ<br>\
الدَّقِيقَ: see 1, in the latter half of the paragraph.<br>\
3<br>\
شاربهُ, (S, A, K, TA,) inf. n. مُشَارَبَةٌ and<br>\
شِرَابٌ, He drank with him; namely, a man.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And He watered his camels, &amp;c. with<br>\
his, i. e. with another&#39;s : or he drew water with<br>\
him for the watering of camels &amp;c.:] see an ex.<br>\
of the latter inf. n. in a verse cited voce شَرِيبٌ.<br>\
4<br>\
أَشْرَبَ see 2, in two places. One says, أَشْرَبْتُ<br>\
الإِبِلَ حَتَّى شَرِبَتْ [I made the camels to drink<br>\
until they were satisfied with drinking; or I<br>\
watered the camels, or gave them to drink, &amp;c.];<br>\
(S, TA;) [for] أَشْرَبَ is syn. with سَقَى. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] الثَّوْبُ يُشْرَبُ الصٍّبْغَ: see 5. And أُشْرِبَ<br>\
الثَّوْبُ حُمْرَةً (tropical:)  The garment, or piece of cloth, was<br>\
imbued, or saturated, with redness. (A.) And<br>\
أَشْرَبَ اللَّوْنَ (tropical:)  He saturated the colour [with dye].<br>\
(K, TA.) And أُشْرِبَ لَوْنًا (assumed tropical:)  It was intermixed<br>\

أُشْرِبَ الأَبْيَضُ حُمْرَةً (assumed tropical:)  The white was suffused, or<br>\
tinged over, with redness. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, أُشْرِبَ<br>\
is also said of a sound, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  It was mixed<br>\
with another sound; as appears from the words<br>\
here following:] حِسُّ الصَّوْتِ فِى الفَمِ مِمَّا لَا إِشْرَابَ<br>\
لَهُ مِنْ صَوْتِ الصَّدْرِ (assumed tropical:)  [The faint, or gentle, sound of<br>\
the voice in the mouth, of such kind as has no<br>\
mixture of the voice of the chest]. (K in art.<br>\
همس.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence also,] أُشْرِبَ الزَّرْعُ: see 1, latter<br>\
half. ―<br>\
-b5-  And أُشْرِبَ فِى قَلْبِهِ حُبَّهُ, (S,) or أُشْرِبَ<br>\
حُبَّ فُلَانٍ, (K,) or حُبَّ فُلَانَةَ, (A,) (tropical:)  [He was<br>\
made to imbibe into his heart the love of him, or<br>\
of such a man, or of such a female;] meaning<br>\
that the love of him, or of her, pervaded, or commingled with, his heart, (S, A, K, TA,) like<br>\
beverage. (TA.) Whence, in the Kur [ii. 87],<br>\
وَأُشْرِبُوا فِى قُلُوبِهِمُ الْعِجْلَ, for حُبَّ العِجْلِ, (S,<br>\
TA,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  And they were made to imbibe [into<br>\
their hearts] the love of the calf.. (Zj, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
And رَفَعَ يَدَهُ فَأَشْرَبَهَا الهَوَآءَ ثُمَّ قَالَ بِهَا عَلَى قَذَالِهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [He raised his hand, and made the air to<br>\
swallow it up, (i. e. raised it so high and so<br>\
quickly that it became hardly seen,) then gave a<br>\
blow with it upon the back of his head]. (A,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And أَشْرَبْتَنِى مَا لَمْ أَشْرَبْ: see 1, latter<br>\
half. ―<br>\
-b8-  And one says to his she-camel, لَأُشْرِبَنَّكِ<br>\
الحِبَالَ (tropical:)  [I will assuredly put upon thee the ropes,<br>\
or cords], and العِقَالَ [the cord, or rope, with<br>\
which the fore shank and the arm are bound<br>\
together]. (A.) [Or] اشربهُ means (tropical:)  He put the<br>\
rope, or cord, upon his neck; namely, a man&#39;s,<br>\
(K, TA,) and a camel&#39;s, and a horse&#39;s or the like:<br>\
(TA:) and اشرب الخَيْلَ he put the ropes, or<br>\
cords, upon the necks of the horses. (K,) And<br>\
اشرب إِبِلَهُ (tropical:)  He tied his camels, every one to<br>\
another. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اشرب as an intrans. verb:<br>\
see 1, last quarter, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He (a<br>\
man, TA) attained to the time for the drinking of<br>\
his camels. (K, * TA.)<br>\
-A3-  اشرب بِهِ: see 1, near<br>\
the end of the paragraph.<br>\
5<br>\
تَشَرَّبَ see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence one says,<br>\
(Mgh,) تشرّب الثَّوْبُ العَرَقَ, (S, Mgh, * K,) and<br>\
الصِّبْغَ, (A, Mgh, L,) (tropical:)  The garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth, imbibed, or absorbed, (S, A, Mgh, * L, K,)<br>\
the sweat, (S, Mgh, K,) and the dye; (A, Mgh,<br>\
L;) as though it drank it by little and little:<br>\
(Mgh:) and [in like manner] one says, الثَّوْبُ<br>\
يشرب الصِّبْغَ [app. ↓ يُشْرَبُ, (like as one says<br>\
يُشْرَبُ حُمْرَةً, as shown in the next preceding<br>\
paragraph,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  The garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth, is made to imbibe, or absorb, the dye].<br>\
(TA.) [It is said that] the verb is not used intransitively in the [proper] language of the Arabs.<br>\
(Mgh.) [But] one says, تشرّب الصِّبْغُ فِى الثَّوْبِ,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  The dye pervaded the garment, or<br>\
piece of cloth: (K, * TA:) and الصِّبْغُ يَتَشَرَّبُ الثَّوْبَ<br>\
(tropical:)  [The dye pervades the garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth]. (TA.) [See also the explanation of a<br>\
verse cited voce تَسَقَّى.]<br>\
10<br>\
استشرب لَوْنُهُ (assumed tropical:)  His, or its, colour became<br>\
intense. (K.) And استشربت القَوْسُ حُمْرَةً (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
bow became intensely red: such is the case when<br>\
it is made of the [tree called] شَرْيَان. (AHn,<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
11<br>\
اِشْرَابَّ: see 4, near the beginning.<br>\
Q. Q. 4<br>\
اِشْرَأَبّ, (S, A, O, K,) inf. n. اِشْرِئْبَابٌ,<br>\
(S, O,) (tropical:)  He raised his head like the camel that<br>\
has satisfied his thirst on the occasion of drinking:<br>\
(A:) or he stretched forth his neck to look: (S,<br>\
A, O, K:) not improbably, from الشُّرْبُ in its<br>\
well known sense, as though he did so when<br>\
preparing to drink: (O:) or, as is said in the L,<br>\
from مَشْرَبَةٌ as syn. with غُرْفَةٌ: (TA:) you say,<br>\
اِشْرَأَبَّ لَهُ, (S, A,) or إِلَيْهِ, (K,) or both; (TA;)<br>\
[the former of which may be rendered He raised<br>\
his head at it, or he stretched forth his neck at it<br>\
to look; or, as also the latter, he stretched forth<br>\
his neck to look at it;] namely, a thing: (S:) or<br>\
اشرأبّ originally means he stretched forth his<br>\
neck in preparing to drink water: and then, in<br>\
consequence of frequency of usage, he raised his<br>\
head, and stretched forth his neck, in looking;<br>\
and hence is trans. by means of إِلَى: (Har p.<br>\
152:) or he raised, or exalted, himself. (K, * TA.)<br>\
يَشْرَئِبُّونَ لِصَوْتِهِ, occurring in a trad., means (tropical:)  They<br>\
will raise their heads at his voice to look at him.<br>\
(TA.) And اِشْرَأَبَّ النِّفَاقُ وَارْتَدَّتِ العَرَبُ, in<br>\
another trad., means (tropical:)  Hypocrisy exalted itself<br>\
[and the Arabs apostatized, or revolted from their<br>\
religion]. (TA.)<br>\

&amp;c.)<br>\
-A2-  And a pl., (S, Msb,) or [rather] a quasipl. n., (ISd, TA,) of شَارِبٌ, q. v. (S, ISd, Msb,<br>\

-A3-  [Golius assigns to it also the meaning<br>\
of “ Linum tenue,” as on the authority of Meyd.]<br>\
شُرْبٌ an inf. n. of شَرِبَ [q. v.]; (S, A, Msb, K,<br>\
&amp;c.;) like ↓ شِرْبٌ: (S, A, K:) or a simple subst.<br>\
[signifying The act of drinking]; (AO, S Msb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ شِرْبٌ. (AO, S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  In the phrase<br>\
أَخُوكَ شُرْبٌ it is used as [an epithet,] meaning ذُو<br>\
شُرْبٍ [which may be regarded as virtually syn.<br>\
with شَارِبٌ or as similar to this latter but intensive<br>\
in signification]. (Ham p. 194.)<br>\
شِرْبٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Water, (K, TA,) itself; so some<br>\
say; (TA;) as also ↓ مِشْرَبٌ, (K, accord. to the<br>\
TA,) with kesr, (TA,) or ↓ مَشْرَبٌ, (so in the<br>\
CK and in my MS. copy of the K,) i. e. water<br>\
that one drinks; so says AZ: pl. of the former<br>\
أَشْرَابٌ. (TA.) [See also شَرَابٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [And A<br>\
draught of milk: see an ex. in a verse cited in<br>\
art. سلف, conj. 4.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And A share, or portion<br>\
that falls to one&#39;s lot, of water: (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K:) or so شِرْبٌ مِنْ مَآءٍ. (ISk, TA.) It is said in<br>\
a prov., آخِرُهَا أَقَلُّهَا شِرْبًا [The last of them is the<br>\
one of them that has the least share of water]:<br>\
originating from the watering of camels; because<br>\
the last of them sometimes comes to the water<br>\
when the watering-trough has been exhausted.<br>\
(S. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 61.]) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
As a law-term, it means The use of water [or the<br>\
right to use it] for the watering of sown-fields<br>\
and of beasts. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also A wateringplace; syn. مَوْرِدٌ: (AZ, K:) pl. as above. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  And (assumed tropical:)  A time of drinking: (K:) but they say<br>\
that it denotes the time only by a sort of tropical<br>\
application; and they differ respecting the connexion of this meaning with the proper meaning.<br>\
(MF, TA.)<br>\
شَرَبٌ: see شَرَبَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
شَرْبَةٌ A single act of drinking. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
A single draught, or the quantity that is drunk<br>\
at once, of water. (S.) It is said in a prov.,<br>\
نِعْمَ مِعْلَقُ الشَّرْبَةِ هٰذَا [Excellent, or most excellent,<br>\
is the traveller&#39;s drinking-cup, or bowl, that will<br>\
hold a single draught, namely, this!]: the مِعْلَق<br>\
is said by As to be a drinking-cup or bowl which<br>\
the rider upon a camel suspends [to his saddle]:<br>\
(Meyd:) it is said in describing a camel: (TA:)<br>\
and it means that, to the place of alighting to<br>\
which he desires to go, he is content with a single<br>\
draught, not wanting another: (Meyd, TA:) the<br>\
prov. is applied to him who, in his affairs, is<br>\
content with his own opinion, not wanting that of<br>\
another person. (Meyd.) شَرْبَةُ أَبِى الجَهْمِ [The<br>\
draught of Abu-l-Jahm] is said of a thing that is<br>\
sweet, or pleasant, but in its result unwholesome:<br>\
(MF, TA:) Abu-l-Jahm was a frequent visiter of<br>\
the Khaleefeh El-Mansoor El-&#39;Abbásee, who,<br>\
finding him troublesome, ordered that a poisoned<br>\
draught should be given to him, in his presence:<br>\
which having been done, Abu-l-Jahm, pained by<br>\
the draught, rose to depart; and being asked by<br>\
the Khaleefeh whither he was going, he answered,<br>\
Whither thou hast sent me, O Prince of the<br>\
Faithful. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b3-  In the Mo&#39;allakah of Tarafeh,<br>\
it is applied to A draught of wine. (EM p. 87.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  [In the conventional language of the physicians, it is a term applied to A dose of medicine,<br>\
such as is drunk and also such as is eaten.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also A palm-tree that grows from the date stone:<br>\
(K:) pl. شَرَبَاتٌ. (TA. [It seems to be there<br>\
added that شَرَائِبُ and شَرَابِيبُ are also its pls.:<br>\
the former may be like ضَرَائِرُ pl. of ضَرَّةٌ: the<br>\
latter is app. a mistranscription, and should perhaps be شَرَائِيبُ, for شَرَائِبُ; like مَحَامِيرُ for مَحَامِرُ,<br>\
&amp;c.])<br>\
شُرْبَةٌ, (K,) or شُرْبَةٌ مِنْ مَآءٍ, (S,) The quantity<br>\
of water that satisfies thirst. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شُرْبَةٌ is<br>\
also syn. with ↓ إِشْرَابٌ [originally an inf. n.]<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  A colour tinged over with another<br>\
colour; as in the saying, فِيهِ شُرْبَةٌ مِنْ حُمْرَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [In<br>\

K.) You say, هُوَ شَرِيِبِى [He is my companion in<br>\
drinking; or in watering his camels with mine:<br>\
&amp;c.]. (TA.) And a rájiz says,<br>\
رُبَّ شَرِيبٍ لَكَ ذِى حُسَاسِ<br>\
كَالحَزِّ بِالمَوَاسِى ↓ شِرَابُهُ<br>\
[Many a one who waters his camels with thine,<br>\

(S, Msb,) or, accord. to ISd, (TA,) شَرْبٌ, which<br>\
signifies people drinking, (K, TA,) and assembling<br>\

رَكْبٌ and رَجْلٌ; and شُرُوبٌ, which is said by<br>\
IAar [and in the S] to be pl. of شَرْبٌ, is pl. of<br>\
شَارِبٌ, like as شُهُودٌ is of شَاهِدٌ; (TA;) شَرَبَةٌ also<br>\
is allowable as a pl. of شَارِبٌ, like as كَفَرَةٌ is pl.<br>\
of كَافِرٌ; (Msb;) and أَشْرُبٌ is pl. of شَرْبٌ, or it<br>\
may be an anomalous pl. of شَارِبٌ: (MF:) the<br>\
pl. شُرُوب occurs in the saying of El-Aashà,<br>\
هُوَ الوَاهِبُ المُسْمِعَاتِ الشُّرُو<br>\
بَ بَيْنَ الحَرِيرِ وَبَيْنَ الكَتَنْ<br>\

some clad in silk and some in linen]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also شِرِّيبٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, The mustache; i. e.] the<br>\
defluent hair over the mouth; (Msb;) or so<br>\
شَوَارِبُ, (Lh, A, K,) which is the pl., (Lh, S,<br>\
Msb,) as though the sing, applied to every distinct<br>\
part: (Lh:) the two [halves] are called شَارِبَانِ:<br>\
(S, TA:) or, as some say, only the sing. is used,<br>\
and the dual is a mistake: (TA:) accord. to<br>\
AHát (Msb, TA) and AAF, (TA,) the dual is<br>\
is scarcely ever, or never, used; but accord. to<br>\
AO, the Kilábees say شَارِبَانِ, with regard to the<br>\
two extremities: (Msb, TA:) and the pl., (A,<br>\
K,) or, accord. to the T &amp;c., the dual, (TA,)<br>\
signifies the long portions [of the hair] on the two<br>\
sides of the سَبَلَة [q. v.]: (T, A, K, TA:) or (K,<br>\
TA) شَارِبٌ signifies the سَبَلَة altogether, (A, K,<br>\
TA,) as some say; but this is not correct. (TA.)<br>\
One says, طَرَّ شَارِبُ الغُلَامِ [The mustache of the<br>\
boy, or young man, grew forth]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
hence, as being likened to the two long portions<br>\
of hair on each side of the سَبَلَة, the شَارِبَانِ of the<br>\
sword, (T, TA,) i. e. (tropical:)  Two long projections<br>\
(أَنْفَانِ طَوِيلَانِ) at the lower part of the hilt,<br>\
(A, * K, TA,) [extending from the guard,] one on<br>\
one side and the other on the other side of the<br>\

throat], (K, TA,) that imbibe the water [or<br>\
saliva?], being the channels thereof: (TA:) and,<br>\
(K,) or, as some say, (TA,) the channels of the<br>\
water [or saliva?] (S, K, TA) in the حَلْق [i. e.<br>\
fauces or throat] (S) or in the neck: (K, TA:)<br>\
or certain ducts (عُرُوق) adhering to the windpipe,<br>\
and the lower parts thereof to the lungs: so says<br>\
IDrd: or rather, some say, the hinder part<br>\
thereof [adhering] to the وَتِين [or aorta], having<br>\
tubes from which the voice issues, and in which<br>\
choking takes place, and whence the saliva issues:<br>\
and those of the horse are said to be [certain<br>\
ducts] by the side of the أَوْدَاج [or external<br>\
jugular veins], where the veterinary surgeon<br>\
draws blood by cutting the اوداج: the sing. seems<br>\
by implication to be شَارِبٌ. (TA.) Hence the<br>\
phrase حِمَارٌ صَخِبُ الشَّوَارِبِ (assumed tropical:)  An ass that brays<br>\
vehemently. (S, TA.) And صَخِبُ الشَّوَارِبِ (tropical:)  [A<br>\
man] having a disagreeable voice: thus likened<br>\
to an ass. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Accord. to IAar, الشَّوَارِبُ<br>\
