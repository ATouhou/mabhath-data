شَهِيَهُ and<br>\
شَهَاهُ: see 8.<br>\
-A2-  شَهَا, aor.<br>\
شَهُوَ; and<br>\
شَهِىَ, aor.<br>\
شَهَوَ; inf. n. شَهْوَةٌ; It [food &amp;c.] was good,<br>\
sweet, pleasant, or the like. (MA. [But this, the<br>\
only meaning there assigned to these two verbs, I<br>\
do not find elsewhere.])<br>\
2<br>\
شَهَّيْتُهُ [I made him, or caused him, to desire,<br>\
to long, or to desire eagerly]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And<br>\
شهّى It excited desire, longing, eager desire, or<br>\
appetence. For ex., in art. سمق in the K, يُشَهِّى<br>\
is said of the سُمَّاق, or berry of the sumach,<br>\
meaning It excites appetence.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And شهّى الشَّىْءَ<br>\
He, or it, caused the thing to be desired, longed<br>\
for, or desired eagerly: made it to be good,<br>\
sweet, pleasant, or the like. (MA.) One says,<br>\
هٰذَا شَىْءٌ يُشَهِّى الطَّعَامَ i. e. [This is a thing that<br>\
causes the food to be desired, &amp;c.; that makes it<br>\
sweet, &amp;c.; or] that incites to desire, or eager<br>\
desire, of the food. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And accord. to<br>\
an explanation of the inf. n., تَشْهِيَةٌ, in the KL,<br>\
شهّاهُ seems to signify also He said to him, I will<br>\
give to thee what thou desirest, longest for, or<br>\
eagerly desirest; agreeably with a rendering of<br>\
the verb alone, as on the authority of that work,<br>\
by Golius.]<br>\
3<br>\
شاهاهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. مُشَاهَاةٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
was, or became, like him; he resembled him.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also He jested, or joked, with him:<br>\
(IAar, TA:) [and] so هَاشَاهُ. (K in art. هشو.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And accord. to IAar, it is also used in relation<br>\
to the smiting action of the [evil] eye [perhaps<br>\
meaning He vied with him in smiting with the<br>\
evil eye: see also 4]. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اشهاهُ He gave him what he desired or<br>\
eagerly desired. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He smote him<br>\
with an [evil] eye: (K:) in this sense [said to be]<br>\
formed by transposition from أَشَاهَهُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
مَا أَشْهَاهَا إِلَىَّ means that she is desired, or eagerly<br>\
desired, [i. e. How great an object of desire is<br>\
she to me!] as though it were from شُهِىَ, though<br>\
this was not said: and مَا أَشْهَانِى لَهَا means that<br>\
thou art desiring, or eagerly desiring, [i. e. How<br>\
desirous, or eagerly desirous, am I of her!] so<br>\
says Sb. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تشهّى He demanded with repeated desire.<br>\
(K, TA.) So in the saying, (TA,) تشهّى عَلَى<br>\
فُلَانٍ كَذَا (S, TA) [He demanded with repeated<br>\
desire, of such a one, such a thing]. ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
what next follows.<br>\
8<br>\
اشتهاهُ (S, &amp;c.) He desired it, or longed for<br>\
it: (Msb:) he loved it; and desired it, or wished<br>\
for it: (K:) or he desired it eagerly, or intensely: (M in art. فرس: [see an ex. in a poetical<br>\
citation voce فَرَّسَ:]) and ↓ شَهِيَهُ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
شَهَوَ; (Msb, K;) as also ↓ شَهَاهُ, aor.<br>\
شَهُوَ; (AZ,<br>\
Msb, K;) inf. n. شَهْوَةٌ (S, TA) and شَاهِيَةٌ, which<br>\
last is an inf. n. [of a rare class] like عَاقِبَةٌ; (TA;)<br>\
signifies the same: (S, Msb, K:) and so does<br>\
↓ تشهّاهُ. (K.) [See what next follows.]<br>\
شَهْوَةٌ [mentioned above as an inf. n.] is a word<br>\
of well-known meaning; (S;) Desire, or longing,<br>\
or yearning, of the soul for a thing; (Er-Rághib,<br>\
Msb, TA;) [meaning for a thing gratifying<br>\
to sense: or eager, or intense, desire; particularly<br>\
for such a thing; for] it has a more intensive signification than إِرَادَةٌ; and the intelligent agree in<br>\
opinion that it is not commendable: (M in art.<br>\
فرس:) [being either lawful or unlawful, it may<br>\
be rendered as above: or appetite: or appetence:<br>\
or lust: or carnal lust:] in the present state of<br>\
existence, it is of two sorts, صَادِقَةٌ [i. e. true], and<br>\
كَاذِبَةٌ [i. e. false]; the former being that without<br>\
which the body becomes in an unsound state, as<br>\
the شَهْوَة [or desire &amp;c.] for food on the occasion<br>\
of hunger; and the latter being that without<br>\
which the body does not become in an unsound<br>\
state: and sometimes it is applied to the object of<br>\
desire &amp;c., or thing desired &amp;c.: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) and agreeably with this last explanation the<br>\
first of the following pls. is used in the Kur iii.<br>\
12: (Ksh, Bd, Jel:) sometimes also it is applied<br>\
to the faculty to which a thing is made an object<br>\
of desire &amp;c.: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [also, to the<br>\
gratification of venereal lust; thus in the K in<br>\
art. شفر; see شَفِرَتْ and شَفِرَةٌ:] the pl. is شَهَوَاتٌ<br>\
(Msb, TA) and أَشْهِيَةٌ and شُهًى; the last mentioned by AHei, and a rare instance of a pl. of the<br>\
measure فُعَلٌ from a sing. of the measure فَعْلَةٌ<br>\
having an infirm letter for its last radical, like<br>\
جُهًى pl. of جَهْوَةٌ [and like قُرًى pl. of قَرْيَةٌ].<br>\
(TA.) [الشَّهْوَتَانِ means The two appetites, that<br>\
of the stomach and that of the generative organ.]<br>\
الشَّهْوَةُ الخَفِيَّةُ [The latent desire &amp;c.] mentioned<br>\
in a trad. is said to be any act of disobedience<br>\
which one conceives in his mind, and upon which<br>\
he resolves: or one&#39;s seeing a beautiful young<br>\
woman, and lowering his eyes, then looking with<br>\
his heart, and imaging her to his mind, and so<br>\
tempting himself. (JM.) [شَهْوَةُ الطِّينِ, lit. The<br>\
longing for clay, is app. used as a general term<br>\
for malacia: see حُمَّاضٌ.]<br>\
شَهْوَانُ (S, Msb, K, TA) and ↓ شَهْوَانِىٌّ and<br>\
↓ شَهِىٌّ, (K, TA,) applied to a man, Desirous, or<br>\
longing; (S, * Msb, * K, * TA;) or very desirous<br>\
or longing; greedy; or voracious: (TA:) fem.<br>\
(of the first, Msb) شَهْوَى: (Msb, K, TA:) pl. [of<br>\
the first] شَهَاوَى, (K, TA,) like سَكَارَى [pl. of<br>\
سَكْرَانُ]. (TA.) [See an ex. of the pl. in a verse<br>\
cited voce جَرْدَبَانٌ.] One says, رَجُلٌ شَهْوَانُ لِلشَّىْءِ<br>\
[A man desirous &amp;c. of the thing]. (S.)<br>\
شَهْوَانِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
شَهِىٌّ i. q. ↓ مُشْتَهًى (S, Msb) [i. e. Desired,<br>\
longed for, or eagerly desired:] or pleasant,<br>\
delicious, or sweet: (Msb, TA:) applied to food,<br>\
(S,) and to water. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] أَبُو الشَّهِىِّ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The بَرْبَط [or Persian lute]. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And<br>\
Golius adds, as on the authority of a gloss in a<br>\
copy of the KL, (assumed tropical:)  The water-melon (anguria).]<br>\
-A2-  See also شَهْوَانُ.<br>\
شَهَّآءٌ A man having much, or frequent, desire or<br>\
longing or eager desire. (TA.) [See also شَهْوَانُ.]<br>\
شَاهٍ [act. part. n. of 1; Desiring, or longing;<br>\
&amp;c.]. (Sb, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شَاهِى البَصَرِ A man sharp of<br>\
sight: (S, K:) formed by transposition from<br>\
شَائِهُ البَصَرِ. (S.)<br>\
أَشْهَى [More, and most, desirable, or pleasant<br>\
or delicious or sweet]. One says, هُوَ أَشْهَى إِلَىَّ<br>\
مِنْ كَذَا [It is more desirable, or pleasant &amp;c.,<br>\
to me, or in my estimation, than such a thing].<br>\
(Msb voce إِلَى.) See also another ex. in a verse<br>\
cited voce إِلَى, in art. الو.<br>\
مُشْتَهًى: see شَهِىٌّ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Used as a subst., its pl.<br>\
is مُشْتَهَيَاتٌ.]<br>\
