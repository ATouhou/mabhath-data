شَابَ, aor. يَشِيبُ, inf. n. شَيْبٌ and شَيْبَةٌ (Msb,<br>\
TA) and مَشِيبٌ, (TA,) He became whitehaired, or hoary. (Msb, TA.) And شاب<br>\
رَأْسُهُ (S,) and رَأْسُهَا, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. شَيْبٌ<br>\
and شَيْبَةٌ, (S,) His head, and her head, became<br>\
white, or hoary. (S, Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
شَابَتْ رُؤُوسُ الآكَامِ (tropical:)  [The heads, or summits, of<br>\
the hills became white, or hoary]. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  And<br>\
شاب الرَّأْسَ It whitened the head: so expl. by<br>\
ISk as used in the following saying, (S,) ascribed<br>\
by J to &#39;Adee, but it is of &#39;Abeed Ibn-El-Abras:<br>\
(IB, TA:)<br>\
تَصْبُو وَأَنَّى لَكَ التَّصَابِى<br>\
↓ وَالرَّأْسُ قَدْ شَابَهُ المَشِيبُ<br>\
[Thou inclinest to silly and youthful conduct: but<br>\
whence cometh to thee the inclining to such conduct when hoariness, or the entering upon the<br>\
period of hoariness, hath whitened the head?].<br>\
(S, * IB, TA.) [See also 2.]<br>\
2<br>\
شيّبهُ الحُزْنُ, (Ks, S, A,) and شيّب الحُزْنُ<br>\
رَأْسَهُ, and بِرَأْسِهِ, (Ks, S, Msb, K,) which last is<br>\
a strange phrase, as it exhibits together two means<br>\
by which a verb is rendered trans., [namely, the<br>\
doubling of the medial radical letter of the verb<br>\
and the introduction of the prep. بِ,] (TA,) Grief<br>\
rendered him white-headed, or hoary-headed; (Ks,<br>\
S, A, Msb, K;) as also ↓ اشابهُ, (A,) and ↓ اشاب<br>\
رَأْسَهُ and بِرَأْسِهِ. (Ks, S, Msb, K. *)<br>\
4<br>\
اشاب, said of a man, He had children that<br>\
had become white-headed, or hoary. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
شَيْبٌ The hair (K, TA) itself: sometimes it is<br>\
thus called: (TA:) [but app. only when white,<br>\
or hoary; in which sense it is often used; as in<br>\
the TA in arts. خضب and صبغ &amp;c.:] or (K, TA,<br>\
in the CK “ and ”) whiteness of the hair, or<br>\
hoariness; (A, K, TA;) as also ↓ مَشِيبٌ: (K,<br>\
TA:) both signify the same [and are thus used as<br>\
simple substs. and are also inf. ns.]: (S:) or the<br>\
former has the latter of the two significations<br>\
given above; (As, S, Mgh, Msb;) and is little<br>\
and much [whiteness of the hair]: one says,<br>\
عَلَاهُ الشَّيْبُ [Whiteness of the hair, or hoariness,<br>\
came upon him]: (TA:) but ↓ مَشِيبٌ signifies a<br>\
man&#39;s entering upon the period of whiteness of<br>\
the hair, or hoariness: (As, S, Msb:) see an ex.<br>\
of this latter in the first paragraph. In the phrase<br>\
in the Kur [xix. 3], وَاشْتَعَلَ الرَّأْسُ شَيْبًا, (S,) meaning And whiteness of the hair of the head hath<br>\
spread therein like as the radiance of fire spreads<br>\
in firewood, (Jel,) [or the head has become<br>\
glistening with whiteness of the hair, or hoariness,]<br>\
شيبا is in the accus. case as a specificative: or,<br>\
accord. to Akh, as an inf. n., as though it were<br>\
said وَشَابَ الرَّأْسُ شَيْبًا. (S, TA. *)<br>\
شِيبٌ, of a whip, a genuine Arabic word of wellknown meaning; (S;) The thong (K, TA) at<br>\
the upper extremity (TA) of a whip: (K, TA:)<br>\
there are two of such thongs, called شِيبَانِ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A word imitative of the sounds made by<br>\
the lips of camels (S, K) in drinking. (S.)<br>\
-A3-  And<br>\
pl. of أَشْيَبُ [q. v.]. (S, K, &amp;c.)<br>\
شُيُبٌ a pl. of which the sing. is doubted: see<br>\
أَشْيَبُ.<br>\
شَيْبَةٌ an inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
accord. to El-Khafájee, A white, or hoary, beard:<br>\
but MF says that this is a conventional postclassical meaning. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [Also, in the present<br>\
day, applied to A species of artemisia; (Forskål&#39;s<br>\
Flor. Aegypt. Arab., p. lxxiii., no. 439;) the<br>\
artemisia arborescens of Linn.: (Delile&#39;s Flor.<br>\
Aegypt. Illustr., no. 799:) ―<br>\
-b2-  and Lichen;<br>\
(Forskål ubi suprà;) the lichen prunastri of Linn.<br>\
(Delile, ib., no. 976 (assumed tropical:) .) And شَيْبَةُ الجَبَلِ Lichen<br>\
scyphifer. (Forskål, p. lxxviii., no. 559.)]<br>\
شَيْبَانُ: see أَشْيَبُ; near the end of the paragraph:<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  and see also the paragraph here following.<br>\
شِيبَانُ and مِلْحَانُ, (S, A,) thus in a verse of<br>\
El-Kumeyt, as related by Ibn-Selemeh, with<br>\
kesr to the ش and م, (S,) or the former word is<br>\
written ↓ شَيْبَانُ, and sometimes شِيبَانُ, and the<br>\
latter is as above, (K,) and sometimes مَلْحَانُ,<br>\
(TA,) (tropical:)  The two months of winter; (A, TA;)<br>\
[as though meaning the second of the Six Seasons,<br>\
commencing two months after the autumnal<br>\
equinox; (see the former of the two tables in p.<br>\
1254;)] i. q. شَهْرَا قِمَاحٍ, (S, A, K, TA,) which are<br>\
the two coldest months; (S, K, TA;) so called<br>\
because of the earth&#39;s being then white with snow<br>\
and hoar frost; (S, TA;) falling at the period of<br>\
the [auroral] rising of the Scorpion and the<br>\
Vulture, (العَقْرَب and النَّسْر, [by which latter is<br>\
meant النَّسْرُ الوَاقِعُ, i. e. the star a of Lyra,])<br>\
said by him who knows not to be the two Kánoons<br>\
[i. e. كَانُونُ الأَوَّلُ and كَانُونُ الثَّانِى, corresponding<br>\
to December and January O.S.]: (TA:) [it<br>\
appears that they nearly agree with the two<br>\
Kánoons; for El-Kazweenee and others say that<br>\
القَلْبُ (i. e. the heart of the Scorpion, which is<br>\
the 18th of the Mansions of the Moon,) and<br>\
النَّسْرُ الوَاقِعُ rise together, and their auroral rising<br>\
in Central Arabia, about the commencement of<br>\
the era of the Flight, accord. to my calculation,<br>\
(see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ in art. نزل,) was on the 25th of<br>\
November O. S.: see also مِلْحَانُ, and قِمَاحٌ:<br>\
it is also said that] شِيبَانُ [used alone] is a name<br>\
of [the month] كانون الاوّل, because of the whiteness of the earth by reason of the hoar-frost and<br>\
snow. (Mgh.)<br>\
شِيَابٌ and شِيَابَةٌ [the former erroneously written<br>\
by Golius شَيَّابٌ]: see شَوْبٌ, in art. شوب.<br>\
شَيُوبٌ: see أَشْيَبُ.<br>\
شَائِبٌ [Being, or becoming, white-haired, or<br>\
hoary]: see أَشْيَبُ. ―<br>\
-b2-  شَيْبٌ شَائِبٌ is a phrase like<br>\
لَيْلٌ لَائِلٌ, (S,) or like شِعْرٌ شَاعِرٌ: it means Intense<br>\
whiteness of the hair. (TA.)<br>\
أَشْيَبُ White-haired, white-headed, or horary:<br>\
(S, A, Mgh, Msb, K:) [it is said to be] anomalous<br>\
in form; (S, Mgh, Msb;) for an epithet of this<br>\
measure is only formed [by rule] from a verb of<br>\
the measure فَعِلَ, aor. يَفْعَلُ; (S, TA;) and it is<br>\
a condition of the formation of such an epithet<br>\
that it must denote a defect or the like, or a<br>\
colour: but أَشْيَبُ signifies white-headed, or hoaryheaded; [so that it does denote a colour;] and ElKhafájee says that it is reckoned among epithets<br>\
denoting defects, or blemishes, like أَعْمَى and<br>\
أَعْرَجُ: (MF, TA:) it is said in the K that it has<br>\
no فَعْلَآء, i. e., (TA,) the epithet شَيْبَآءُ is not applied<br>\
to a woman; (Msb, TA;) شَمْطَآءُ being used in its<br>\
stead; (TA;) though one says شَابَ رَأْسُهَا: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) [but see Har p. 418, where شَيْبَآءُ is mentioned, applied to a woman, as meaning aged, and<br>\
white, or hoary, in the head: and see شَيْبَآءُ in art.<br>\
شوب:] the pl. is شِيبٌ; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
with which is syn. شُيَّبٌ; (TA, as from the K;<br>\
[but not found by me in the copies of the K to<br>\
which I have had access;]) and ↓ شُيُبٌ: (K,<br>\
TA:) this last is said by IM to be allowable in<br>\
poetry, عَلَى التَّمَامِ [here meaning as though it<br>\
were a word composed of sound letters]; and this<br>\
is the assertion of the lexicologists [in general]:<br>\
ISd thinks it to be pl. of ↓ شَائِبٌ [q. v.], like as<br>\
بُزُلٌ is of بَازِلٌ; or pl. of ↓ شَيُوبٌ [which app. means<br>\
very white or hoary in the head], accord. to the<br>\
dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, who say دَجَاجَةٌ<br>\
بَيُوضٌ and دَجَاجٌ بُيُضٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one<br>\
says, رَأَيْتُ الجِبَالَ شِيبًا (tropical:)  I saw the mountains<br>\
white with snow and hoar frost. (A, TA.) And<br>\
شِيبٌ [used alone] signifies (assumed tropical:)  Mountains upon<br>\
which snow falls, and which are white, or hoary,<br>\
therewith: (S, L:) or mountains white with snow<br>\
or with dust: and, some say, white clouds: sing.<br>\
أَشْيَبُ. (L, TA.) And, applied to truffles (كَمْأَة),<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  White and large: (TA:) or simply white. (Id.<br>\
voce تَعَاشِيبُ.) ―<br>\
-b3-  يَوْمٌ أَشْيَبُ (assumed tropical:)  A day in which are<br>\
cold and clouds and صُرَاد [correctly صُرَّاد, meaning<br>\
thin clouds, or cold and humid clouds, in which<br>\
is no water]; as also ↓ يَوْمٌ شَيْبَانُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  لَيْلَةُ<br>\
الشَّيْبَآءِ, (K,) or لَيْلَةُ شَيْبَآءَ, (TA,) and لَيْلَةٌ شَيْبَآءُ,<br>\
(TA voce حُرٌّ,) (assumed tropical:)  The last night of the [lunar]<br>\
month: (K, TA:) its first night is called لَيْلَةُ<br>\
حُرَّةٍ and لَيْلَةٌ حُرَّةٌ. (K voce حُرٌّ.) بَاتَتْ بِلَيْلَةِ شَيْبَآءَ,<br>\
and بِلَيْلَةِ الشَّيْبَآءِ: see in art. شوب.<br>\
مَشِيبٌ: see شَيْبٌ, in two places.<br>\
