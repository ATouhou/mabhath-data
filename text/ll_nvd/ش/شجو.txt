شَجِىَ, aor.<br>\
شَجَوَ, inf. n. شَجًا, He was choked;<br>\
or his throat, or fauces, became obstructed; (S,<br>\
K;) بِهِ by it; i. e. a bone or the like. (K.) One<br>\
says, عَلَيْكَ بِالكَظْمِ وَلَوْ شَجِيتَ بِالعَظْمِ [Keep thou<br>\
to self-restraint though thou be choked by the<br>\
bone]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, [hence, by a metaphor,<br>\
(see Har p. 33,)] aor. and inf. n. as above, (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
grieved, mourned, or lamented; or was sorrowful,<br>\
sad, or unhappy: (S, Msb:) and he was, or became, anxious, or disquieted in mind. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also, aor. and inf. n. as above, said of a creditor<br>\
(غَرِيم), He went away, عَنْهُ [from him]. (K.<br>\
[See 4.])<br>\
-A2-  شَجَا بَيْنَهُمْ It was, or became, an<br>\
occasion of contention, or dispute, or of disagreement, or difference, between them. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  شَجَاهُ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
شَجُوَ, inf. n. شَجْوٌ, (S, Msb,) [app.<br>\
originally syn. with أَشْجَاهُ in the first of the senses<br>\
assigned to the latter in the next paragraph: ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
and hence,] (assumed tropical:)  It (anxiety, Msb) grieved him; or<br>\
caused him to mourn or lament, or to be sorrowful<br>\
or sad or unhappy; (S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ اشجاهُ.<br>\
(K.) And, said of wealth (الغِنَى), inf. n. شَجْوٌ,<br>\
It excited his griefs, mournings, &amp;c., and his<br>\
desire. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, and ↓ اشجاهُ, (assumed tropical:)  It caused<br>\
him to be mirthful, (Ks, K, TA,) and excited<br>\
him. (Ks, TA.) Thus each of these verbs has<br>\
two contr. significations. (K.) But MF observes<br>\
that طَرَّبَهُ, the explanation here given in the K,<br>\
is said by the author of the K [in art. طرب] to<br>\
denote a lightness arising from joy or grief. (TA.)<br>\
[Generally, however, it means as rendered above.]<br>\
4<br>\
اشجاهُ, inf. n. إِشْجَآءٌ, It choked him; or<br>\
caused his throat, or fauces, to be obstructed;<br>\
syn. أَغَصَّهُ; (S, TA;) said of a bone lying across<br>\
in the throat, or fauces. (TA.) [This is clearly<br>\
shown to be the meaning in the S, as well as in<br>\
the TA, intended by أَغَصَّهُ; with which it is also<br>\
syn. in another sense; for] ―<br>\
-b2-  It signifies [also]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  It, or he, caused him to fall into grief, mourning, lamentation, sorrow, sadness, or unhappiness.<br>\
(K.) See also 1, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
subdued, overpowered, or overcame, him, (K,<br>\
TA,) so that he grieved, or was sorrowful. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  He angered him. (Ks, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He made him to go away. (Az, TA.) And<br>\
أَشْجَيْتُهُ عَنِّى (assumed tropical:)  I gave him (i. e. a creditor or petitioner) what contented him, so that he went away.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَشَاجَتْ عَلَيْهِ, (As, T, K, * TA,) said of a<br>\
woman of the desert with reference to a young<br>\
man who had been dallying, and holding amorous<br>\
converse, with her, (As, T, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  She resisted<br>\
him, and expressed grief, or unhappiness, to him,<br>\
or on account of him, [i. e. on account of his<br>\
advances,] saying, Alas, my grief, or my unhappiness! (As, T, K, * TA.) And said of a<br>\
woman with reference to her husband, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  She expressed grief, &amp;c., as above. (A, TA.)<br>\
شَجًا A bone, or some other thing (S, K) of the<br>\
like sort, (K,) sticking fast, (S,) or lying across,<br>\
or forming an obstruction, (K,) in the throat, or<br>\
fauces, (S, K,) of a human being, and of a beast;<br>\
(TA;) a thing in the throat, or fauces, that<br>\
[chokes one, or] prevents from swallowing: (Har<br>\
p. 69:) an inf. n. used as a subst. [properly thus<br>\
termed]. (Har p. 33.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next paragraph.<br>\
شَجْوٌ (assumed tropical:)  Anxiety, or disquietude of mind; and<br>\
grief, mourning, lamentation, sorrow, sadness,<br>\
or unhappiness; (S;) [and] so ↓ شَجًا: thus<br>\
termed because a man is choked thereby. (Har<br>\
p. 33.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  A want; an object of want.<br>\
(Az, K, TA.) One says, بَكَى فُلَانٌ شَجْوَهُ [app.<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one wept for his object of want]:<br>\
and دَعَتِ الحَمَامَةُ شَجْوَهَا [app. (assumed tropical:)  The pigeon called<br>\
for its object of want]. (TA.)<br>\
شَجٍ (assumed tropical:)  Grieving, mourning, or lamenting; or<br>\
sorrowing, sad, or unhappy; applied to a man;<br>\
(S, Msb;) and شَجِيَةٌ, of the measure فَعِلَةٌ, applied to a woman: one says, وَيْلٌ لِلشَّجِى مِنَ<br>\
الخَلِىِّ [mentioned and expl. voce خَالٍ, in art.<br>\
خلو, where each of these epithets is written with<br>\
teshdeed to the ى; and likewise in another saying there mentioned]: (S:) or, in this saying,<br>\
(TA,) it signifies occupied [by anxiety or grief];<br>\
(K, TA; [in the CK, الشَّجا is erroneously put<br>\
for الشَّجِى;]) and خَلِىّ means “ free [therefrom]: ” so says AZ: and in this instance الشَّجِى<br>\
may mean occupied by a bone choking, or obstructing, his throat, or fauces, or by anxiety,<br>\
and not having found a way of escape therefrom;<br>\
or by his opponent, or adversary, whom he has<br>\
been unable to withstand: (TA:) and sometimes<br>\
one says ↓ شَجِىٌّ, like as one says حَزِنٌ and<br>\
حَزِينٌ; though this is rare; (Msb;) it is mentioned in the &#39;Eyn; but شَجٍ is more known; and<br>\
is said by Az to be the chaste form: (TA:) Mbr<br>\
says, the ى of الخلى is with teshdeed, and the<br>\
ى of الشَّجِى is without teshdeed, (S,) and sometimes this ى is with teshdeed in poetry; (S, K;)<br>\
but if you make it to be from شَجَاهُ, it is ↓ شَجِىٌّ<br>\
only, syn. with مَشْجُوٌّ. [i. e. grieved, &amp;c.]; (S;)<br>\
and so it is said to be by Az and Z: and Az adds,<br>\
the second way of accounting for it is, that they<br>\
often lengthen فَعِلٌ with a ى, saying, فُلَانٌ قَمِنٌ<br>\
لِكَذَا and قَمِينٌ, and سَمِجٌ and سَمِيجٌ, and كَرٍ and<br>\
كَرِىٌّ: and the third way is, that they assimilated one word in measure to another, as in الغَدَايَا<br>\
وَالعَشَايَا, the [proper] pl. of غَدَاةٌ being only<br>\
غَدَوَاتٌ. (TA.)<br>\
شَجِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
مَفَازَةٌ شَجْوَآءُ [A desert, or waterless desert,]<br>\
difficult to travel. (S, K. *)<br>\
شَجَوِىٌّ, with fet-h to the ج; rel. n. of شَجٍ. (S.)<br>\
شَجَوْجًى, (S, K,) of the measure فَعَوْعَلٌ [and<br>\
therefore with tenween], (Mz 40th نوع, and MF<br>\
and TA,) like خَجَوْجًى &amp;c., (S, * and Mz ibid.,)<br>\
and ↓ شَجَوْجَآءٌ, (K,) applied to a man, (S,) Long<br>\
in the legs: (S, K:) or very tall: or very tall,<br>\
with bigness (ضِخَم, in the CK ضَخْم,) of the<br>\
bones: or long in the back, short in the leg; (K;)<br>\
thus in the M; but Az says the reverse, i. e. long<br>\
in the legs, short in the back. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
(K,) or the former, (TA,) A bulky horse. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And The عَقْعَق [or magpie]; (K;) [and] so<br>\
شَجَجَى; (K and TA in art. شج;) fem. with ة<br>\
[i. e. شَجَوْجَاةٌ]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A wind continually<br>\
blowing; as also شَجَوْجَاةٌ. (K.) All this is in<br>\
the M. (TA.)<br>\
شَجَوْجَآءٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
أَمْرٌ شَاجٍ An affair, or event, grieving; or<br>\
causing to mourn or lament, or to be sorrowful or<br>\
sad or unhappy. (TA.)<br>\
