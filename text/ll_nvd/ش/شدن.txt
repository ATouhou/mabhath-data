شَدَنَ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
شَدُنَ, (S,) inf. n. شُدُونٌ, (S,<br>\
K,) said of a gazelle, and of the young of any<br>\
cloven-hoofed animal, and camel, and solid-hoofed<br>\
animal, He became strong, and in no need of his<br>\
mother: (K:) or he became strong, and in a good<br>\
state of body, and active and grown up, and vied<br>\
with his mother in his faculties [so I render<br>\
مَالَكَ أُمَّهُ of which I do not find any explanation]<br>\
so that he went along with her; and [in this sense]<br>\
it is said of a colt also: (TA:) or, said of a<br>\
young gazelle, he became strong, and his horns<br>\
came forth, and he became in no need of his<br>\
mother: and sometimes it is said of a colt [in a<br>\
similar sense]. (S.) Hence, it is said of a boy,<br>\
meaning He became strong, and active and grown<br>\
up. (Har p. 536.)<br>\

اشدنت She (a gazelle) had a young one that<br>\
had become such as is termed شَادِن. (S, K.)<br>\
شَدْنٌ A kind of tree, (K, TA,) having weak,<br>\
or soft, and thick stems, (TA,) the flower of which<br>\
is like the jasmine (K, TA) in form, but tinged<br>\
with redness, and more pleasant [in odour] than<br>\
the jasmine; said by IB to be of pleasant odour.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
شَدَنِيَّاتٌ Certain she-camels, so called in relation<br>\
to a place in El-Yemen, (S, K, and EM p. 229,)<br>\

certain stallion. (IAar, K, TA. [In the CK,<br>\
فَحْلٌ is erroneously put for فَحْلٍ.])<br>\
شَادِنٌ A young gazelle that has become strong,<br>\
and whose horns have come forth, and that has<br>\
become in no need of his mother: (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
TA: [see شَصَرٌ:]) when used alone, [not as an<br>\
epithet, in which quality it seems to be applied<br>\
also to the young of any cloven-hoofed animal,<br>\
and camel, and solid-hoofed animal, (see 1,)] it<br>\
means [simply] a young gazelle. (S, TA.)<br>\
مُشْدِنٌ [without ة] A doe-gazelle whose young<br>\
one has become such as is termed شَادِن: (S, K,<br>\
TA:) or who has a شَادِن following her: and in<br>\
like manner applied to other animals of the clovenhoofed kind, and of the solid-hoofed, and to a<br>\
camel: (TA:) pl. مَشَادِنُ and مَشَادِينُ, (S, K,)<br>\
like مَطَافِلُ and مَطَافِيلُ, (S,) [pls. of مُطْفِلٌ,] the<br>\
latter pl. anomalous. (TA.)<br>\

has newly attained to puberty, and has not been<br>\
married; or that is between the periods of puberty<br>\
and middle age; &amp;c.]. (IAar, K.)<br>\
