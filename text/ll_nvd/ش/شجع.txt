ability, lean, or emaciated, and small in body,<br>\
having no heart; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K;) as also<br>\
↓ شَجْعَةٌ: (Lh, K:) the former seems to have the<br>\
meaning of a pass. part. n., [i. e. of مَشْجُوعٌ, q. v.,]<br>\
like سُخْرَةٌ and other words. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád.)<br>\

شَجَاعٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
شُجَاعٌ and ↓ شِجَاعٌ (Lh, ISk, S, Msb, K) and<br>\
↓ شَجَاعٌ, (Msb, K,) which is of the dial, of Benoo-<br>\
&#39;Okeyl, being made by them to accord with its<br>\
contr., which is جَبَانٌ, (Msb,) and ↓ شَجِيعٌ (Lh,<br>\
S, Msb, K) and ↓ أَشْجَعُ (S, K) and ↓ شَجِعٌ (K)<br>\
and ↓ شِجَعٌ, (as in some copies of the K,) or<br>\
↓ شِجَعَةٌ, (as in other copies of the K and in the<br>\

S, Msb) شِجْعَةٌ [a pl. of pauc.] (AO, S, Msb, K)<br>\
and [of the first three, and perhaps of the 4th<br>\
also,] شَجَعَةٌ (S, K) and (of the 1st, S) شِجْعَانٌ<br>\
(Lh, S, K) and (of the 4th, S) شُجْعَانٌ (Lh, ISk,<br>\

as is said in the TA, but the word is there written<br>\
without any syll. signs,] and (of the 4th, S, Msb)<br>\
↓ شُجَعَآءُ (S, Msb, K) and [of the 4th, and perhaps<br>\
of others also,] شِجَاعٌ, (K,) and also, (but these<br>\
are quasi-pl. ns., TA,) ↓ شَجْعَةٌ (AO, S, K) and<br>\
↓ شُجْعَةٌ (K) and ↓ شَجَعَآءُ [app. a mistake<br>\
for شِجَعَآءُ or شَجْعَآءُ]: (TA:) pl. fem. [all of<br>\
شَجِيعَةٌ, or the last of شَجْعَآءُ or of شَجِعَةٌ,] شَجَائِعُ<br>\
and شِجَاعٌ and شُجُعٌ: (Lh, K:) or شُجَاعٌ is [an<br>\
epithet] peculiar to men: (K, * TA:) AZ says,<br>\
“ I have heard the Kilábees say, رَجُلٌ شُجَاعٌ, but<br>\
they do not apply this epithet to a woman: ” (S:)<br>\
↓ شَجِعَةٌ and ↓ شَجِيعَةٌ, however, are applied to a<br>\
woman, and signify bold, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K,) longtongued, and vehemently clamorous, towards men;<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA;) audacious in her speech, (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, K, [but these two epithets as applied to<br>\
a woman and signifying “ bold ” &amp;c. are omitted<br>\
in the CK,]) and in her length of tongue, and<br>\
vehement clamorousness. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
شُجَاعٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ شِجَاعٌ (K) also signify<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The serpent; (K;) and so does ↓ أَشْجَعُ: (TA:)<br>\
or (tropical:)  the male serpent: (Mgh, K:) or a certain<br>\
species of serpent, (Sh, S, Msb, K,) as also ↓ أَشْجَعُ,<br>\
(S,) small, (K,) or slender, and asserted to be the<br>\
boldest of the serpent-kind: (Sh:) pl. شِجْعَانٌ<br>\
(Lh, IDrd, K) and شُجْعَانٌ, (IDrd, K,) the former<br>\
of which is the more common: (IDrd:) the pl.<br>\
of أَشْجَعُ is أَشَاجِعُ; or, as some say, this is pl. of<br>\
أَشْجِعَةٌ, which is pl. [of pauc.] of شجاع, signifying the serpent. (TA.) [See also شَجْعَمٌ, above.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  The serpent called صَفَرٌ, that presents<br>\
itself in the belly (S, K, * TA) of a man, as the<br>\
Arabs assert, when he has been long hungry: (S,<br>\
TA:) but As says that شُجَاعُ البَطْنِ signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  vehemence of hunger. (Az, TA.)<br>\
شِجَاعٌ: see شُجَاعٌ, in two places.<br>\
شَجِيعٌ; fem. with ة: see شُجَاعٌ, in three places.<br>\
شَاجِعٌ: see شَجْعَةٌ.<br>\
أَشْجَعُ; fem. شَجْعَآءُ: see شُجَاعٌ, in four places.<br>\
You say also, لَبُؤَةٌ شَجْعَآءُ A bold lioness. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to a man, accord. to some, it signifies,<br>\
(S,) or it signifies also, (K,) In whom is lightness, or unsteadiness, like what is termed هَوَجٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) by reason of his strength. (S.) See also<br>\
شَجِعٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  Mad; or possessed by a devil: (TA:)<br>\
Lth says that, applied to a man, it signifies one<br>\
who is as though there were in him madness, or<br>\
diabolical possession; but Az says that this is a<br>\
mistake; for, were this its meaning, the poets<br>\
would not have used it in praise. (TA, in another<br>\
part of the art.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Tall: (IDrd, Msb, K:) and<br>\
so the fem. applied to a woman. (IDrd, Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  Bulky; big-bodied; or stout: or, as some<br>\
say, youthful; or in a state of youthful vigour.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  The lion. (Lth, S, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  It is said in<br>\
the K that الأَشْجَعُ also signifies الدَّهْرُ [i. e. Time;<br>\
or fortune; &amp;c.]; and J says that this is what the<br>\
poet means by the expression, أَشْجَعُ أَخَّاذٌ: but<br>\
this cannot be the correct meaning, for the poet,<br>\
namely El-Aashà, says,<br>\
بِأَشْجَعَ أَخَّاذٍ عَلَى الدَّهْرِ حُكْمُهُ<br>\
by الاشجع meaning himself, or some other thing.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (S, K,) and إِشْجَعٌ, (K,) or the<br>\
latter accord. to some, but this was not known to<br>\
Abu-l-Ghowth, (S,) sing. of أَشَاجِعُ, [in some<br>\
copies of the S written أَشَاجِيعُ, but the former,<br>\
which, as is mentioned in the TA, is found in the<br>\
handwriting of J, is that which is commonly<br>\
known,] which signifies [The knuckles nearest<br>\
to the wrist; this being what is meant by]<br>\
the bases (أُصُول) of the fingers, which are<br>\
connected with the tendons of the outer side of<br>\
the hand: (S, K:) in the T, we find the heads<br>\
(رُؤُوس) of the fingers, instead of اصول: (TA:)<br>\
or اشجع in the hand and foot [but see what<br>\
follows] signifies the tendons extended above the<br>\
سُلَامَى [here meaning the metacarpal and metatarsal bones] from the wrist to the bases<br>\
(أُصُول) of the fingers or toes, which are called<br>\
أَطْنَابُ الأَصَابِعِ, above the outer side of the hand:<br>\
or the bone which connects the finger with the<br>\
wrist; [i. e. the metacarpal bone;] every finger<br>\
having to it a bone thus called: he who says that<br>\
the أَشَاجِع [so here instead of اشجع as above]<br>\
are the tendons calls those bones the أُسْنَاع.<br>\
(TA.) Aboo-Bekr is described as عَارِى الأَشَاجِعِ<br>\
عَنْ مَفَاصِلِ الأَصَابِعِ, meaning Having little flesh<br>\
upon what are thus termed: or having their<br>\
tendons apparent. (TA.) [See also رَاجِبَةٌ and<br>\
بُرْجُمَةٌ.]<br>\
-A3-  أَشْجَعُ مِنْ دِيكٍ [More courageous<br>\
than a cock] is one of the proverbs of the Arabs.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
مُشْجَعٌ, like مُجْمَلٌ, (K, TA,) i. e. having the<br>\
form of a pass. part. n., (TA,) [in the CK مَشْجَع,<br>\
like مَحْمَل,] In the utmost state of madness, or<br>\
diabolical possession: (K:) so says Ibn-Abbád;<br>\
and hence, accord. to him, شُجَاعٌ [but in what<br>\
sense he does not say]. (TA.)<br>\
مَشْجُوعٌ Overcome, or surpassed, in شَجَاعَة [or<br>\
courage, &amp;c.]. (K, TA.)<br>\
