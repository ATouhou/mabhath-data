شَاحَ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also, accord. to Freytag,<br>\
on the authority of the “ Kitáb el-Addád,” He<br>\
was brave, or bold: thus having two contr. significations. ―<br>\
-b3-  Another meaning assigned to it by<br>\
him, in common with شَايَحَ and أَشَاحَ, as on the<br>\
authority of the K, i. e. “ Diligens fuit,” is a mistake.]<br>\
2<br>\
شيّحهُ, (O,) inf. n. تَشْيِيحٌ, (K,) He cautioned<br>\
him; or made him to fear, or be in fear. (O, K. *)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And He removed him, or it, far away. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  And شيّح, (O, TA,) inf. n. as above, (K,) He<br>\
looked at his adversary, or antagonist, and<br>\
straitened him, or treated him with hardness or<br>\
harshness: (O, K, * TA:) from IAar. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
شَاْيَحَ see the next paragraph, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also He fought. (T, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اشاح, (S, A, K,) inf. n. إِشَاحَةٌ, (IAar, TA,)<br>\
He was cautious, or in fear, (S, A, K,) مِنْهُ [of<br>\
it], (A, TA,) i. e. a thing, or an affair, (TA,) and<br>\
عَلَى حَاجَتِهِ [for the thing that he wanted]; (K;)<br>\
as also ↓ شايح, (S, A, K,) inf. مُشَايَحَةٌ and شِيَاحٌ;<br>\
and ↓ شَاحَ: (K:) or he was cautious and in fear,<br>\
endeavouring to repel death. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  But in the<br>\
dial. of Hudheyl, (S,) He strove, laboured, toiled,<br>\
or exerted himself, فِى أَمْرٍ [in an affair]; and so<br>\
↓ شايح. (S, A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He continued journeying, or going on. (O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اشاح بِوَجْهِهِ He turned<br>\
away his face, (S, A, TA,) from a [person or]<br>\
thing, or from the heat of fire, or a hot odour, and<br>\
from something hurtful: (TA:) or he exerted<br>\
himself in aversion or turning away. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
One says, كَلَّمْتُهُ فَأَشَاحَ بِوَجْهِهِ I spoke to him, and<br>\
he turned away his face. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  اشاح also signifies He advanced, or came forward; syn. أَقْبَلَ.<br>\
(Fr, O, TA.) [Thus it has two contr. meanings.<br>\
See also the part. n., مُشِيحٌ.] ―<br>\
-b6-  And He defended<br>\
what was behind his back. (IAth, TA.) [See,<br>\
again, the part. n.] ―<br>\
-b7-  اشاح بِذَنَبِهِ, said of a horse,<br>\
He let his tail hang down loosely. (Lth, S.) F, in<br>\
the K, following Az and Sgh, says that this is<br>\
a mistranscription of the verb, for اساح; but his<br>\
assertion requires proof. (MF.) [See the latter<br>\
verb, in art. سيح.]<br>\
-A2-  اشاحت الأَرْضُ The land<br>\
produced the plant called شِيح. (AHn, O, K.)<br>\
شِيحٌ Cautious, or fearing; (A, K;) as also<br>\
↓ شَائِحٌ, (A, TA,) and ↓ مُشِيحٌ: (As, O:) or this<br>\
last, cautious, or fearing, and at the same time<br>\
striving, labouring, toiling, or exerting himself:<br>\
(Az, TA:) or all signify prudent; discreet; or<br>\
having, or using, precaution, or good judgment;<br>\
(Ham p. 281;) and so ↓ شَيْحَانُ. (Id. p. 43.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
In the dial. of Hudheyl, (S, O,) Striving, labouring, toiling, or exerting himself, (S, A, O, K,) in<br>\
affairs; (S, O, K;) and so ↓ شَائِحٌ, (A, K,) and<br>\
↓ مُشِيحٌ: (As, O, K:) pl. of the first [and app.<br>\
of the second also] شِيَاحٌ: (S, O.)<br>\
-A2-  Also [The<br>\
artemisia Judaïca; and absinthium Ponticum;<br>\
species of wormwood;] a certain plant, (AHn,<br>\
S, A, O, K,) well known, (AHn, O, K,) of several<br>\
species, (AHn, O,) of some [species] whereof<br>\
brooms are made, (L,) [and which is also used<br>\
for fumigation,] the leaves of which are [of the<br>\
kind called] هَدَب; (AHn, O, L;) it has a sweet<br>\
odour, but its taste is bitter; is pasture for horses<br>\
and camels; and the places of its growth are the<br>\
plains and the meadows: (AHn, O, L:) pl.<br>\
شِيحَانٌ. (Fr, O, L.)<br>\
-A3-  Accord. to the K, [probably on the authority of Lth,] it signifies also A<br>\
[garment of the kind called] بُرْد, of El-Yemen:<br>\
but Az says that there is no kind of garment so<br>\
called: the correct word is سَيْحٌ, with [the unpointed] س [and with fet-h]. (TA.)<br>\
شَيْحَانُ [and probably with tenween also]: see<br>\
شِيحٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Very jealous; (S, O, K;) because<br>\
such is cautious for his wives, or women under<br>\
covert, or household or family; (S, O;) and so<br>\
↓ شَائِحٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (O, K,) and ↓ شِيحَانٌ,<br>\
(As, O, K,) Tall: (O, K:) or goodly in tallness.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And the former, That makes, or utters, a<br>\
low sound in running; [so I render يَتَهَمَّسُ عَدْوًا<br>\
in the K and TA; in the O and in my MS. copy<br>\
of the K, يَتَهَمَّشُ; but the former I think the<br>\
right reading; app. by reason of quickness, or<br>\
swiftness; for it is added,] quickness, or swiftness,<br>\
is meant thereby: (O, TA: *) mentioned by Az,<br>\
on the authority of Khálid Ibn-Jembeh. (TA.)<br>\
[In this sense it seems to be with tenween: for]<br>\
شَيْحَانَةٌ [is its fem. and] means A quick, or swift,<br>\
she-camel. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also A horse strong in<br>\
spirit; syn. شَدِيدُ النَّفْسِ; (O, K, TA; in the<br>\
CK, النَّفَسِ [i. e. in breath];) and so ↓ شِيحَانٌ:<br>\
thus expl. by Skr. (O.)<br>\
شِيحَانٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
شِيَاحٌ Mutual caution or fear. (And The<br>\
act of striving, labouring, toiling, or exerting oneself, in anything. (K.) [But in both of these<br>\
senses it seems to be an inf. n. of 3, q. v.]<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
(K) Drought, dearth, scarcity. (O, K.)<br>\
شَائِحٌ: see شِيحٌ, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also<br>\
شَيْحَانُ.<br>\
مُشِيحٌ: see شِيحٌ, in two places. It is also expl.<br>\
as meaning Striving, labouring, toiling, or exerting himself, and persevering in his work: (A:)<br>\
and striving &amp;c., and hastening, or going quickly.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Advancing, or coming forward, to<br>\
one. (Fr, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Defending what is behind one&#39;s back. (Fr, O, K.)<br>\
مُشَيَّحٌ is expl. as meaning Striped; applied to<br>\
a garment: but Az says that there is no such<br>\
word, so applied: the correct word is مُسَيَّحٌ, with<br>\
[the unpointed] س. (TA.)<br>\
مَشِيحَى: see the following paragraph.<br>\
مَشِيحَآء: see the following paragraph.<br>\
مَشْيُوحَى: see the following paragraph.<br>\
مَشْيُوحَآءُ (S, O, K) and ↓ مَشِيحَى (O, K) A<br>\
state of haste: (S, O, K:) or a state of confusion:<br>\
(K:) the latter meaning mentioned in the L:<br>\
(TA:) you say, هُمْ فِى مَشْيُوحَآءَ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ (S, O,<br>\
K) and فى مَشِيحَى من امرهم (O, K) They are<br>\
in a state of haste in respect of their affair:<br>\
(S, O, K:) or in a state of confusion in their<br>\
affair: (L, K:) as having the latter meaning,<br>\
Ibn-Málik says that it is مَشِيجَآء, with ج and<br>\
medd, of the measure فَعِيلَآء, not مَفْعِلَآء; but this<br>\
requires consideration: Ibn-Umm-Málik and<br>\
others, following AHei, say that ↓ القَوْمُ فِى مَشِيحَآءَ<br>\
مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ means the people, or party, are in a<br>\
state of striving, labour, toil, or exertion, and<br>\
determination, or resolution, in respect of their<br>\
affair. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  مَشْيُوحَآءُ also signifies A land<br>\
that produces the plant called شِيح; (S, O, K;)<br>\
and so ↓ مَشْيُوحَى: (O, K:) or it signifies many<br>\
plants of the kind so called: thus in the T, on the<br>\
authority of As and A &#39;Obeyd, and so says AHn,<br>\
as is stated [in the O and] in the R; (TA;)<br>\
AHn saying further that it is like مَشْيُوخَآء meaning a company of شُيُوخ [or elderly men], and<br>\
مَعْيُورَآء meaning a herd of عُيُور [or asses], &amp;c.;<br>\
(O;) [so that it is a quasi-pl. n.;] but this is<br>\
disallowed by El-Mufaddal Ibn-Selemeh. (TA.)<br>\
