the camel by means of his زِمَام [or nose-rein], (S,<br>\
K,) or pulled the خِطَام [or halter, or leadingrope,] of the camel, (M,) while riding him, (S,<br>\
M,) in the direction of his [own] head, (M,) so<br>\
as to make the prominences behind his [the<br>\
camel&#39;s] ears cleave to the upright piece of wood<br>\
rising from the fore part of the saddle: (M, K:)<br>\
or he raised the camel&#39;s head (M, Msb, K) by<br>\
pulling his زِمَام, (M, Msb,) while riding him,<br>\
(Msb, K,) like as the rider of the horse does with<br>\
his horse: (Msb:) and ↓ اشنقهُ signifies the same:<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K:) or ↓ اشنق is intrans.; you say,<br>\
شَنَقَ البَعِيرَ and هُوَ ↓ اشنق, the reverse of the usual<br>\
rule; (IJ, M;) or the latter is intrans. also; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) signifying he (the camel) raised his<br>\
head. (S, M, Msb, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, شَنَقْتُهَا, occurring in a trad., referring to a female hare, inf. n.<br>\
as above, means, as implying restraint, I cast, or<br>\
shot, at her, or I struck her, so as to render her<br>\

the K,) or to a peg, (M,) or to an elevated peg,<br>\
(K,) so that his neck became extended and erect.<br>\
(M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And شَنَقَ القِرْبَةَ, (IDrd, O, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
شَنُقَ, (IDrd, O,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
bound the mouth of the water-skin with the bond<br>\
called وِكَآء, and then bound the extremity of its<br>\
وِكَآء to its fore legs: (IDrd, O, K, TA: [in the<br>\
CK, أَوْكَأَها is erroneously put for أَوْكَاهَا, or, as<br>\
in some copies of the K, وَكَاهَا:]) or he suspended<br>\
it: and [in like manner] القِرْبَةَ ↓ اشنق, inf. n. as<br>\
above, he suspended the water-skin to a peg:<br>\
(TA:) or the latter signifies he put a شِنَاق to the<br>\
water-skin: (M:) or he bound the water-skin<br>\
with a شِنَاق, (S, K, TA,) i. e. a cord with which<br>\
its mouth is bound. (S.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [Hence شَنَقَهُ, as used<br>\
in the present day, and in post-classical works,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He hanged him by the neck, till he<br>\
died: (see the pass. part. n., below:) whence<br>\

شينق beneath it; and sometimes two portions of<br>\
the honey-comb, and three: (M: [accord. to which<br>\
one says also, شَنَقَ فِى الخَلِيَّةِ القُرْصَيْنِ وَالثَّلَاثَةَ:])<br>\
this is done only when the bees are rearing their<br>\
young ones. (M, K. *) ―<br>\
-b8-  Accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed,<br>\
الشَّىْءَ ↓ أَشْنَقْتُ and شَنَقْتُهُ signify the same: (TA:<br>\
[in which the meaning is not expl.; but it is immediately added, app. to indicate the meaning<br>\
here intended;]) El-Mutanakhkhil El-Hudhalee<br>\
says, describing a bow and arrows,<br>\
شَنَقْتُ بِهَا مَعَابِلَ مُرْهَفَاتٍ<br>\
i. e. I put its string into [the notches of] arrows<br>\
[broad and long in the heads, made sharp or<br>\
pointed]. (O, * TA.)<br>\

(K;) and شَنَقَ, (M, K,) aor.<br>\
شَنِقَ; (K;) He loved a<br>\
thing, and became attached to it; (M, K, TA;)<br>\
said of a man: (TA:) and شَنِقَ, inf. n. شَنَقٌ, is<br>\
said of a man&#39;s heart, (O, TA,) meaning as above:<br>\
(O:) or شَنَقٌ signifies the heart&#39;s yearning towards, or longing for, or desiring, a thing.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A3-  شَنَقٌ also signifies The being long:<br>\
(M:) or the being long in the head, (JK, S, TA,)<br>\
as though it were stretched upwards: (TA:) one<br>\
says of a horse, شَنِقَ inf. n. شَنَقٌ, meaning He<br>\
was long in the head. (JK.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شَنَقُ المَرْأَةِ, signifies اِسْتِنَانُهَا مِنَ الشَّحْمِ [app. meaning The woman&#39;s<br>\
becoming sleek, like مَسَانّ (or whetstones) by<br>\
reason of fat: see اِسْتَنَّتِ الفِصَالُ, in art. سن]:<br>\
and the epithet applied to her is ↓ شَنِقَةٌ, pl. شَنِقَاتٌ.<br>\
(JK, Ibn-&#39; Abbád, O, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
شنّق الخَلِيَّةَ, inf. n. تَشْنِيقٌ: see 1, in the latter<br>\
half of the paragraph. ―<br>\

cutting [a thing] in pieces. (O, K. [See the<br>\
pass. part. n.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The adorning [a person or<br>\
thing]. (K. [See 5.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also the next paragraph, near the end.<br>\
3<br>\
شانقهُ, inf. n. مُشَانَقَةٌ and شِنَاقٌ, He mixed<br>\
his cattle with his [i. e. another&#39;s] cattle: (K,<br>\
TA:) this is when [contributions to the poor-rate<br>\
such as are termed] أَشْنَاق [pl. of شَنَقٌ] are incumbent on a man, or two men, or three, when their<br>\
cattle are separate, and one says to another,<br>\
شَانِقْنِى, i. e. Mix thou my cattle and thy cattle;<br>\
for if they are separate, a شَنَق will be obligatory,<br>\
or incumbent, on each of us; and if they are<br>\
mixed, the case will be light to us: so the شِنَاق<br>\
signifies the sharing in the شَنَق or in the شَنَقَانِ.<br>\
(L, TA.) [See also what follows in this paragraph:<br>\
and see شَنَقٌ.] One says also ↓ لَا تَشَانَقُوا [for<br>\
لَا تَتَشَانَقُوا] Ye shall not put together what are<br>\
separate [of cattle]; التَّشَانُقُ being syn. with<br>\
المُشَانَقَةُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شِنَاقٌ signifies also The taking<br>\
somewhat from the شَنَق: and hence the trad.,<br>\
لَا شِنَاقَ: (K, TA:) this means There shall not be<br>\
taken from the شَنَق [any contribution to the poorrate] unless it is complete [in number]: (A&#39; Obeyd,<br>\
S, TA:) the شَنَق being, of camels, such as exceed<br>\
five, up to ten; and what exceed ten, up to<br>\
fifteen: (A &#39;Obeyd, TA:) Aboo-Sa&#39;eed Ed-Dareer<br>\
says, up to nine; and up to fourteen: but this is<br>\
pronounced in the L to be wrong: (TA:) [Mtr<br>\
also says,] it means there shall not be taken aught<br>\
of what exceed five, up to nine, for example: or,<br>\
accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed Ed-Dareer, it is like the<br>\
mixing; but this requires consideration: (Mgh:)<br>\
Aboo-Sa&#39;eed says that لَا شِنَاقَ means a man shall<br>\
not adjoin (↓ لَا يُشْنِقُ [thus written here and thus<br>\
expl. in the TA]) his sheep or goats, and his<br>\
camels, to the sheep or goats [and the camels] of<br>\
another person, in order to annul what is obligatory, or incumbent, on him, of the poor-rate:<br>\
this is [for instance] in the case in which each of<br>\
them has forty sheep or goats; so that it is incumbent on them to give two sheep or goats;<br>\
but when one of them adjoins (أَحَدُهُمَا ↓ فَإِذَا شَنَّقَ<br>\
[thus in this instance in the TA, perhaps a mistranscription for أَشْنَقَ,]) his sheep or goats to<br>\
those of another, and the collector of the poorrate finds them in his [the latter&#39;s] possession, he<br>\
takes from them one sheep or goat. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اشنق: see 1, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  إِشْنَاقٌ [as<br>\
inf. n. of أُشْنِقَ, from أَشْنَقَ القِرْبَةَ expl. in the first<br>\
paragraph,] also signifies The having the hand<br>\
attached to the neck by means of a غُلّ [q. v.].<br>\
(AA, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 3, in the latter half.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Accord. to IAar, (O, TA,) اشنق also signifies<br>\
He took (O, K, TA) the شَنَق, i. e., (O, TA,) the<br>\
[fine termed] أَرْش: (O, K, TA:) or it was, or<br>\
became, obligatory, or incumbent, on him to give<br>\
the أَرْش; thus having two contr. meanings [assigned to it]: (K:) or it signifies also, accord. to<br>\
IAar, it was, or became, obligatory on him to give<br>\
what is termed a شَنَق; and this is the case until<br>\
his camels amount to five and twenty, when what<br>\
is due of them is [a she-camed such as is termed]<br>\
اِبْنَة مَخَاض. (O.) A man of the Arabs said,<br>\
مِنَّا مَنْ يُشْنِقُ, which may mean Of us is he who<br>\
gives the شُنُق, i. e. cords, pl. of شِنَاقٌ: or it may<br>\
mean, who gives the شَنَق, i. e. أَرْش. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
اشنق عَلَيْهِ He exalted himself above him; domineered over him; or oppressed him. (O, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تشنّق He adorned himself; or was, or became, adorned: (JK, O:) and he clad himself<br>\
with garments. (JK.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَشَاْنَقَ see 3.<br>\
شَنَقٌ What is between one فَرِيضَة and the next<br>\
فَرِيضَة, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
[meaning a number that is between two other<br>\
numbers whereof each imposes the obligation of<br>\
giving a due termed فَرِيضَة,] of camels, and of<br>\
sheep or goats, (M, TA,) in relation to the poorrate: (S, Mgh, K, TA:) so called because nothing<br>\
is taken therefrom; so that it is adjoined (أُشْنِقَ<br>\
i. e. أَضِيفَ) to that [number] which is next to it<br>\
[of the numbers below it]: (JK:) accord. to<br>\
some, it is syn. with وَقَصٌ; (Mgh, Msb;) but<br>\
some say that it relates peculiarly to camels; (M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb;) and وَقَصٌ, to bulls and cows: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) used in relation to sheep or goats, it is<br>\
what is between forty and a hundred and twenty;<br>\
and in like manner as to other numbers [that<br>\
impose the obligation of giving a فريضة]: K,<br>\
TA:) Ahmad Ibn-Hambal is related to have said<br>\
that the شَنَق is what is above the فريضة, absolutely; as, for instance, what is above forty sheep<br>\
or goats: (TA: [I here render the word دُونَ<br>\
“ above,” though it also means “ below,” because<br>\
nothing is due from sheep or goats fewer than<br>\
forty:]) as A&#39;Obeyd says, it is, of camels, such as<br>\
exceed five, up to ten; and what exceed ten, up to<br>\
fifteen: (O, * TA: [see also 3:]) Ks states, on<br>\
the authority of some one or more of the Arabs,<br>\
that it is up to twenty-five; and says that it is<br>\
what does pot impose the obligation of the فريضة;<br>\
meaning what is between five and twenty-five:<br>\
(Fr, TA:) [but it is also expl. as applied to the<br>\
due itself that is to be contributed to the poorrates for certain numbers of camels: thus] Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee says, the شَنَق for five<br>\
camels is a sheep or goat; for ten, two sheep or<br>\
goats; for fifteen three sheep or goats; and for<br>\
twenty, four sheep or goats; the term شَنَقٌ being<br>\
applied alike to the sheep or goat, and to the two<br>\
sheep or goats, and to the three sheep or goats,<br>\
and to the four sheep or goats; what exceeds this<br>\
last being termed فَرِيضَةٌ: (TA:) or, in the case<br>\
of the poor-rate, the lowest شَنَق (الشَّنَقُ الأَسْفَلُ) is<br>\
a sheep or goat for five camels; and the highest<br>\
شَنَق (الشَّنَقُ الأَعْلَى) is a بِنْت مَخَاض for five and<br>\
twenty: (O, K:) the pl. of شَنَقٌ is أَشْنَاقٌ (M,<br>\
Msb, TA) and شِنَاقٌ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also What is<br>\
above the bloodwit (مَا دُونَ الدِّيَةِ): (As, S, O,<br>\
Msb, K:) the term أَشْنَاق, (S, M, Msb,) pl. of<br>\
شَنَقٌ, (M,) being applied to the fines, for wounds,<br>\
that are sent with the complete bloodwit (S, M, *<br>\
O, Msb) by him upon whom rests the obligation<br>\
to send such; (S, O, Msb;) as though they were<br>\
attached to the main, or greatest, fine: (S, M, *<br>\
O:) and an addition, in the bloodwit, (M, Msb,)<br>\
of five, (M,) or of six, (M, Msb,) or of seven,<br>\
(Msb,) to the hundred camels [which constitute<br>\
the complete bloodwit], (M, Msb, *) in order that<br>\
it may be described as ample: (Msb:) [for,] as<br>\
IAar and As and El-Athram say, the man of<br>\
rank or quality, when he gave [the bloodwit],<br>\
used to add to it five [or more] camels, to show<br>\
thereby his excellence and his generosity: (TA:)<br>\
a redundancy [in the case of the bloodwit]; (O,<br>\
K;) one of the explanations of the term given by<br>\
As: (O:) or in the case of bloodwits (دِيَات), the<br>\
lowest شَنَق (الشَّنَقُ الأَسْفَلُ) is twenty camels whereof<br>\
every one is a بِنْت مَخَاض; and the highest شَنَق<br>\
(الشَّنَقُ الأَعْلَى) is twenty camels whereof every one<br>\
is a جَذَعَة: (O, K:) and some say that أَشْنَاقُ الدِّيَاتِ<br>\
means the sorts of bloodwits; the bloodwit for<br>\
purely-unintentional homicide being a hundred<br>\
camels, which those who are responsible for it<br>\
undertake to give in fifths, consisting of twenty<br>\
whereof every one is an اِبْنَة مَخَاض, and twenty<br>\
whereof every one is an اِبْنَة لَبُون, and twenty<br>\
whereof every one is an اِبْن لَبُون, and twenty<br>\
whereof every one is a حِقَّة, and twenty whereof<br>\
every one is a جَذَعَة; these also being termed<br>\
أَشْنَاق. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It signifies also A fine, or<br>\
mulct, for a wound or the like; (O, Msb, K;)<br>\
as, for instance, for a burn, (O, TA,) or such as<br>\
a wound on the head that lays bare the bone,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) and other wounds, (Msb,) and for a<br>\
tooth [knocked out], and for an eye blinded, and<br>\
for an arm or a hand vitiated, or rendered unsound and motionless, or stiff; and for anything<br>\
short of what requires the complete bloowit:<br>\
(TA:) or, as some say, a fine for that which does<br>\
not render obnoxious to retaliation; as a scratch,<br>\
or laceration of the skin, and the like: (M:) pl.<br>\
أَشْنَاقٌ. (M, Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A burden borne on<br>\
one side of a beast, equiponderant to another<br>\
borne on the other side; syn. عِدْلٌ: (K, TA: [in<br>\
the CK and my MS. copy of the K, العَدْلُ is<br>\
erroneously put for العِدْل:]) الشَّنَقَانِ signifies<br>\
العِدْلَان. (JK, Ibn-&#39; Abbád, O, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A<br>\
rope, or cord. (Ibn-&#39; Abbád, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A<br>\
bow-string; (O, TA;) as also ↓ شِنَاقٌ; (O, K, *<br>\
TA;) so called because it is bound to the head<br>\
of the bow: (O, TA:) or, accord. to Sh, a good<br>\
bow-string, i. e. strong and long. (TA.) [See<br>\
what follows.]<br>\
-A3-  الشَّنَقُ also signifies العَمَلُ [The<br>\
making a thing]: (K:) thus accord. to some in<br>\
the saying of Ru-beh, describing a sportsman<br>\
[and his bow],<br>\
سَوَّى لَهَا كَبْدَآءَ تَنْزُو فِى الشَّنَقْ<br>\
[as though meaning He prepared for it, or them,<br>\
a bow such that the part whereby it was held<br>\
filled the hand, springing in the making by reason<br>\
of its elasticity and strength: but the word which<br>\
I have written تَنْزُو, and which is thus in one place<br>\
in the TA, and in another place in the same,<br>\
where the verse is repeated, تَنْزُوا, is illegible in<br>\
the copy of the O, and may be a mistranscription]:<br>\
accord. to others, however, the last word, الشَّنَقْ,<br>\
here means the bow-string. (O, TA.)<br>\
شَنِقٌ, applied to a heart, Loving intensely, or<br>\
very passionately or fondly; syn. هَيْمَانُ. (M,<br>\
TA.) Accord. to Lth, ↓ قَلْبٌ شَنِقٌ مِشْنَاقٌ signifies<br>\

قَلْبٌ شَنِقٌ كَكَتِفٍ مُشْتَاقٌ طَامِحٌ إِلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ;<br>\
but the right reading is قَلْبٌ شَنِقٌ مِشْنَاقٌ كَكَتِفٍ<br>\
وَمِحْرَابٍ, and the signification as above; primarily<br>\
relating to the eye. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to a man,<br>\
Cautious; or fearful. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  شَنِقَةٌ, applied to<br>\
a woman: see 1, last sentence.<br>\
شِنَاقٌ A rope, or cord, with which the head of a<br>\
he-camel and of a she-camel is pulled: [see 1, first<br>\
sentence:] pl. [of pauc.] أَشْنِقَةٌ and [of mult.]<br>\
شُنُقٌ. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A cord, (A&#39; Obeyd, S, K,) or<br>\
thong, (A&#39; Obeyd, K,) with which the mouth-of a<br>\

in order that the water may pour forth: (A&#39; Obeyd,<br>\
TA:) or the suspensory cord of a water-skin:<br>\

a woman, and to a he-camel, and to a she-camel:<br>\
applied to a she-camel as meaning tall, and longnecked; as also ↓ شَنْقَآءُ: and to a he-camel as<br>\
meaning tall and slender: (ISh, TA:) also, and<br>\
↓ مَشْنُوقٌ, applied to a horse as meaning tall. (T,<br>\
TA.) See also أَشْنَقُ.<br>\
شَنِيقٌ One whose origin is suspected; syn. دَعِىٌّ:<br>\
a poet says,<br>\

دَنِىْءٌ وَلَا يُدْعَى إِلَيْهِ شَنِيقُ<br>\
