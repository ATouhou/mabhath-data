شَكُمَ, inf. n. شَكْمٌ, He bitted him;<br>\
[namely, a horse or the like;] he put the bit<br>\
(شَكِيمَة) into his mouth. (TA.) ―<br>\

الوَالِىَ, (S, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  He bribed the والى [i. e. prefect, or the like];<br>\
as though he stopped his mouth with the شَكِيمَة,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) i. e. the [bit, or] iron thing of the<br>\
لِجَام. (TA.) And شَكَمَ فَاهُ بِالإِتَاوَةِ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [He<br>\
stopped (lit. bitted) his mouth] with the bribe.<br>\
(TA in art. اتو.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فَعَلَ فُلَانٌ أَمْرًا فَشَكَمْتُهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Such a one did a thing, or performed an affair,<br>\
and I settled, or established, it. (Lth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And شَكَمَهُ, (S, K,) aor. as above, (S,) and so the<br>\
inf. n.; (K;) and ↓ اشكمهٌ; (Th, K;) He repaid,<br>\
requited, compensated, or recompensed, him; (S,<br>\
K; *) or gave him what is termed شُكْم [q. v.]:<br>\
(K:) he gave him his hire, or pay. (S, from a<br>\
trad.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And, as some say, (S,) شَكَمَهُ, inf. n.<br>\
شَكْمٌ and شَكِيمٌ, He bit him. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  شَكِمَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
شَكَمَ, (K,) inf. n. شَكَمٌ, (TK,) He was, or became, hungry. (K.)<br>\

شُكْمٌ (S, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ شُكْمَى; (K;) of the latter,<br>\
ISd says, “I think it to be a dial. var., but I am<br>\
not certain of it; ” (TA;) A repayment, requital,<br>\
compensation, or recompense; (El-Umawee,<br>\
A&#39; Obeyd, S, K;) and شُكْبٌ is a dial. var. thereof:<br>\
(TA:) when the gift is initial, it is termed شُكْدٌ:<br>\
(S:) or a substitute; or thing given, received,<br>\
put, or done, by way of replacement or exchange:<br>\
(Ks, TA:) and (K) a gift; (As, K, TA;) as also<br>\
شُكْدٌ; (As, TA;) or the latter signifies a gift<br>\
without compensation: (TA:) or شُكْمٌ signifies a<br>\

(Lth, TA.)<br>\
شَكِمٌ A lion: (K:) expl. in this sense as occurring in a verse of Aboo-Sakhr El-Hudhalee: or,<br>\
accord. to Skr, as there used, quickly, or soon,<br>\
angry; or violently angry. (TA.)<br>\
شُكْمَى: see شُكْمٌ.<br>\
شَكِيمٌ: see شَكِيمَةٌ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The<br>\
loop-shaped handles of the cooking-pot. (S, K.)<br>\
[<br>\
شَكَامَةٌ expl. by Golius as meaning “ Malitia<br>\
indolis, contumacia,” as on the authority of the<br>\
KL, is app. a mistake for شَكَاسَةٌ, which I find<br>\
expl. in the KL as signifying the “ being evil in<br>\
nature, or natural disposition,” but not شكامة. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Freytag explains it as meaning also Likeness; a<br>\
signification of شَكِيمَةٌ, also mentioned by him;<br>\
but for this he names no authority, and I know of<br>\
none.]<br>\
شَكِيمَةٌ, in the لِجَام, [The bit-mouth, or mouthpiece of a pit; i. e.] the transverse piece of iron<br>\
in the mouth of the horse, in which is the فَأْس<br>\
[q. v.]; (S, K;) as also ↓ شَكِيمٌ: (S:) [see also<br>\
لِجَامٌ, and مِسْحَلٌ:] or ↓ شَكِيمٌ is pl. of شَكِيمَةٌ, as<br>\
also شَكَائِمُ and شُكُمٌ, (K, TA,) this last with two<br>\
dammehs, [but written in the CK شُكْمٌ,] or [rather<br>\
↓ شَكِيمٌ is a coll. gen. n., and] شُكُمٌ is said by some<br>\
to be pl. of شَكِيمٌ, not of شَكِيمَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
[as used in phrases mentioned below,] (TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  Resistance, or incompliance: (S, TA:) disdain,<br>\
scorn, or disdainful and proud incompliance or<br>\
refusal: and self-defence from wrong treatment:<br>\
(K:) and self-magnification, pride, or haughtiness; syn. شَمَمٌ; السَّمُّ in the copies of the K being<br>\
a mistake for الشَّمَمُ: (TA:) firmness, strength, or<br>\
vehemence, of spirit; (TA, and Ham p. 140;)<br>\
and evilness of nature or disposition: (Ham<br>\
ibid:) strength of heart: (IAar, TA:) hardiness;<br>\
courage, or courage and energy; or determination; syn. عَارِضَةٌ: vigorousness, strenuousness, or<br>\
energy: (TA:) also [simply] nature, or natural<br>\
disposition; syn. طَبْعٌ. (K, TK: in the CK الطَّبَعُ<br>\
is [erroneously] put in the place of الطَّبْعُ.) One<br>\
says, فُلَآنٌ ذُو شَكِيمَةٍ (tropical:)  Such a one is resistant, or<br>\
incompliant: (S, TA:) or disdainful, or scornful;<br>\
resistant, unyielding, or incompliant: one who<br>\
defends himself from wrong treatment: proud:<br>\
hardy: courageous: one possessing prudence or<br>\
discretion, or firmness or soundness of judgment.<br>\
(TA.) And فُلَانٌ شَدِيدُ الشَّكِيمَةِ, meaning [in<br>\
like manner] (tropical:)  Such a one is firm, strong, or<br>\
vehement, of spirit; (S, TA, and Ham p. 140;)<br>\
disdainful, or scornful; resistant, unyielding, or<br>\
incompliant; (S, K, TA;) so says ISk: (TA:)<br>\
or, as some say, one possessing strength, or vehemence, of tongue; and perspicuity, or eloquence,<br>\
of speech or language; or perspicuity of speech<br>\
with quickness, or sharpness, of intellect; and<br>\
much hardiness, or courage, or courage and<br>\
energy, or determination. (Ham p. 140.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also (assumed tropical:)  Likeness, or resemblance. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A compact, or covenant; syn. عَهْدٌ: (K, TA:)<br>\
in some copies of the K, الفَهْدُ is erroneously put<br>\
for العَهْدُ. (TA.)<br>\
شكو and شكى<br>\
1<br>\
شَكَا, (K,) first pers. شَكَوْتُ, (S, Msb,) of<br>\
which شَكَيْتُ is a dial. var., (K in art. شكى,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
1َ2ُ3َ, (S, Msb,) [and of the latter<br>\
1َ2ِ3َ,] inf. n.<br>\
شَكْوٌ, (S, Msb,) or شَكْوَى, (K,) or this is a simple<br>\
subst., (S, Msb,) also pronounced شَكْوًى, (K,)<br>\
and شِكَايَةٌ, (S, K,) with kesr, (K,) in which the<br>\
ى is [said to be] substituted for و because most<br>\
inf. ns. of the measure فِعَالَةٌ of verbs ending with<br>\
an infirm radical letter are of verbs of which that<br>\
letter is ى, (TA,) or this also is a simple subst.,<br>\
(Msb,) and شَكَاةٌ, (S, K,) or this too is a simple<br>\
subst., (Msb,) and شَكَاوَةٌ, (K,) and شَكِيَّةٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
is a trans. verb; (S, Msb, K;) and ↓ اشتكى signifies the same; (S, K;) as also ↓ تشكّى: (K:)<br>\
one says, شَكَا أَمْرَهُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ and ↓ اشتكى [i. e.<br>\
اشتكى أَمْرَهُ], and ↓ تشكّى [i. e. تشكّى أَمْرَهُ], (K,<br>\
TA,) meaning [He complained of his case to<br>\
God; or] he told to God the weakness of his<br>\
condition: (TA:) and شَكَوْتُ فُلَانًا and ↓ اِشْتَكَيْتُهُ<br>\
[I complained to such a one of his conduct to<br>\
me]; (S;) [or] شَكَا فُلَانًا means he told such a one<br>\
of his evil conduct to him: (TA:) and شَكَا فُلَانًا<br>\
إِلَى فُلَانٍ He complained of such a one to such a<br>\
one: (MA:) [and شَكَوْتُ إِلَيْهِ كَذَا I complained<br>\
to him of such a thing:] see 4: and [in like manner] إِلَيْهِ كَذَا ↓ اشتكى He complained to him of<br>\
such a thing: (MA:) and مِنْهُ ↓ اِشْتَكَيْتُ [I complained of him, or it; like شَكَوْتُهُ]: (Msb:) Er-Rághib says, الشِكَايَةُ is The showing, or revealing,<br>\
of grief, or sorrow; whence the saying in the<br>\
Kur [xii. 86], إِنَّمَا أَشْكُو بَثِّى وَحُزْنِى إِلَى اللّٰهِ [I<br>\
only show my grief and my lamentation to God];<br>\
and in the same [lviii. 1], إِلَى اللّٰهِ ↓ وَتَشْتَكِى [And<br>\
showeth her grief, or sorrow, to God]; the primary signification of الشَّكْوُ being the opening of<br>\
the small skin for water or milk called شَكْوَة, and<br>\
showing what is in it; so that it is as though<br>\
originally metaphorical [though what is termed<br>\
حَقِيقَةٌ عُرْفِيَّةٌ (expl. in art. حق)]; like the phrases<br>\
بَثَثْتُ لَهُ مَا فِى وِعَائِى and نَفَضْتُ لَهُ مَا فِى جِرَابِى,<br>\
meaning “ I showed him what was in my heart. ”<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شَكَا is also said of a camel as meaning<br>\
He stretched out his neck, and made much moaning,<br>\
or prolonged utterance of a complaining voice,<br>\
being fatigued by journeying. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
شَكَاهُ, (MA, K, TA,) inf. n. شَكْوٌ and شَكَاةٌ and<br>\
شَكْوَى, (MA, TA,) is said in relation to a disease,<br>\
or sickness; (MA, K, TA;) meaning He (a<br>\
diseased, or sick, person) complained of it, namely,<br>\
his disease, or sickness; (MA; [accord. to the<br>\
TK, followed in this case, as in many others, by<br>\
Freytag, it means it (i. e. disease, or sickness,)<br>\
afflicted him; which I think to be indubitably a<br>\
mistake;]) and ↓ تشكّى and ↓ اشتكى signify the<br>\
same [as شَكَا مَرَضَهُ he complained of his disease,<br>\
or sickness]: (TA:) [or] these two verbs (تشكّى<br>\
and اشتكى) signify [or signify also] he was, or<br>\
became, diseased, or sick. (TA in additions at<br>\
the end of this art.) One says also, ↓ اشتكى<br>\
عُضْوًا مِنْ أَعْضَائِهِ and ↓ تشكّى, both meaning the<br>\
same [i. e., originally, He complained of a pain,<br>\
or disease, in some one of his members; but<br>\
generally meaning he had a complaint of, or a<br>\
pain or a disease in, some one of his members;<br>\
and شَكَا عُضْوًا not unfrequently occurs used in the<br>\
same sense]: (S:) [thus one often says of a brute;<br>\
for ex.,] As says, in explaining القُلَابُ as meaning<br>\
“ a certain disease that attacks the camel,”<br>\
مِنْهُ قَلْبَهُ ↓ يَشْتَكِى [he has a pain in consequence<br>\
thereof in his heart; in which قَلْبَهُ, though<br>\
determinate, may be considered as an explicative,<br>\
like بَطْنَهُ in the phrase أَلِمَ بَطْنَهُ, q. v.]. (S in art.<br>\
قلب.) ―<br>\
-b4-  One says also, هُوَ يُشْكَى بِكَذَا, meaning<br>\
He is accused, or suspected, of such a thing; syn.<br>\
يُتَّهَمُ بِهِ: (K: [there mentioned as though it were<br>\
from أُشْكِىَ, and held to be so by the author of the<br>\
TK; but it is from شُكِىَ; as though meaning he<br>\
is complained of by reason of such a thing:])<br>\
mentioned by Yaakoob, in the “ Alfádh. ” (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شكى فُلَانٌ [thus in my original, app. شَكَا or<br>\
شَكَى,] is mentioned by Az as meaning The nails<br>\
of such a one became split in several, or many,<br>\
places. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
شَكَّتِ النِّسَآءُ, inf. n. تَشْكِيَةٌ; and ↓ اشتكت; and<br>\
↓ تشكّت; (K;) or, accord. to Th, only this last;<br>\
(TA;) The women took for themselves, or made,<br>\
a شَكْوَة [q. v.] for the churning of milk; (K,<br>\
TA;) because it was little in quantity; the شكوة<br>\
being small, so that only a small quantity can be<br>\
churned in it: (TA:) or, as in the T, شكّى and<br>\
↓ تشكّى he took for himself, or made, a شَكْوَة:<br>\
(TA:) [or] so ↓ اشتكى: (S:) and so ↓ اشكى.<br>\
(IKtt, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شَكَّى شَاكِيَهُ, inf. n. تَشْكِيَةٌ, expl.<br>\
in the K as meaning كَفَّ عَنْهُ and طَيَّبَ نَفْسَهُ, is<br>\
a foul mistranscription: correctly, سَلَّى شَاكِيَهُ,<br>\
meaning “ He comforted his complainer, and<br>\
consoled him for that which had befallen him; ”<br>\
as in the Tekmileh. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
شاكاهُ, inf. n. مُشَاكَاةٌ, He complained of<br>\
him, i. q. شَكَاهُ: or he told of his deceit, guile, or<br>\
circumvention, and his vices, or faults. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اشكاهُ [He made him, or caused him, to<br>\
complain;] he did to him that which made him,<br>\
or caused him, to have need to complain of him.<br>\
(S, Msb.) He increased his annoyance and complaining. (Az, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He removed, or<br>\
did away with, his complaint; or made his complaint to cease; (S, * Mgh, Msb, K;) he caused<br>\
him to be pleased or contented [and so relieved<br>\
him from his complaint]; syn. أَعْتَبَهُ مِنْ شَكْوَاهُ;<br>\
(S, and Har p. 337;) i. e. أَرْضَاهُ; (Har ibid.;) and<br>\
he desisted from that of which he complained:<br>\
(S, * Msb:) thus it has two contr. significations.<br>\
(S, K.) Hence the saying, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) in<br>\
a trad., (TA,) إِلَى رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ حَرَّ الرَّمْضَآءِ ↓ شَكَوْنَا<br>\
فِى صِيَامِنَا فَلَمْ يُشْكِنَا [We complained, to the<br>\
Apostle of God, of the heat of the burning<br>\
ground, in our fasting,] and he did not remove,<br>\
or cause to cease, our complaint. (Mgh, * Msb,<br>\
TA.) And [hence] one says, اشكى فُلَانًا مِنْ فُلَانٍ,<br>\
meaning He took for such a one, from such a one,<br>\
what pleased or contented him [and so relieved<br>\
him from complaining of him]. (ISd, K, TA:<br>\
omitted in the CK.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also He told him his<br>\
complaint, and the desire, or longing of the soul,<br>\
that he endured. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And i. q. وَجَدَهُ شَاكِيًا<br>\
[which may mean He found him to be complaining, or, as seems to be indicated by what immediately precedes it in the K, he found him to be<br>\
complaining of a disease of the slightest sort]:<br>\
(K:) or, as in the T, اشكى [app. meaning اشكى<br>\
حَبِيبَهُ] signifies he found the object of his love, or<br>\
his friend, to be complaining; expl. by صَادَفَ<br>\
حَبِيبَهُ يَشْكُو. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 2.<br>\
5<br>\
تشكّى He expressed complaint or lamentation, pain, grief, or sorrow; syn. تَوَجَّعَ; (Msb<br>\
and K in art. وجع;) he made complaint or<br>\
lamentation. (MA, KL.) See 1, in four places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence] one says, تشكّى شَآئِى أَرْضَ كَذَا,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [My sheep or goats] forsook such a<br>\
land, [as though they complained of it,] and did<br>\
not go near it. (TA. [But I have substituted<br>\
شَائِى for what is there written شاكى, an evident<br>\
mistranscription.])<br>\
-A2-  See also 2, in two places.<br>\
6<br>\
تَشَاكَوْا They complained, one to another.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِ1ْتَ2َ3َ see 1, in nine places:<br>\
-A2-  and see also 2, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
شَكْوٌ inf. n. of شَكَا. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also used<br>\
in the sense of وَجْدٌ [meaning Grief, mourning,<br>\
or sorrow]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, and ↓ شَكْوَى, and<br>\
↓ شَكَاةٌ, and ↓ شَكَآءٌ, and ↓ شَكْوَآءُ, (K,) this last<br>\
mentioned by Az, (TA,) [but it is omitted in<br>\
some copies of the K,] A complaint, meaning a<br>\
disease, malady, or sickness. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, the<br>\
first, A small, or young, lamb: or a small, or<br>\
young, camel: (K accord. to different copies: in<br>\
some, الشَّكْوُ having for its explanation الحَمَلُ<br>\
الصَّغِيرُ, and thus in the TA: in others, الجَمَلُ<br>\
الصغير:) mentioned by ISd. (TA.)<br>\
شَكَاةٌ an inf. n. of شَكَا; (S, K;) or a simple<br>\
subst., like شَكْوَى. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also شَكْوٌ. ―<br>\

a verse cited voce رِفَاقٌ.]<br>\
شَكْوَةٌ The skin of a sucking kid, (T, * S, M, *)<br>\
for milk: that of the جَذَع and of such as is<br>\
above that [in age] is termed وَطْبٌ; (S;) or that<br>\
of the جَذَع is termed سِقَآءٌ; and that of such as is<br>\
weaned, بَدْرَةٌ: (T, TA:) or a receptacle of skin<br>\

as some say, in which water is cooled and in<br>\
which milk is kept close: (TA:) or a small skin<br>\

which water is put: (Er-Rághib, TA:) the dim.<br>\
is ↓ شُكَيَّةٌ: (TA:) and the pl. is شَكَوَاتٌ and شِكَآءٌ<br>\
(K, TA) and شُكِىٌّ [like as بُدُورٌ is a pl. of بَدْرَةٌ,<br>\
being originally شُكُووٌ, like as دُلِىٌّ (pl. of دَلْوٌ) is<br>\
originally دُلُووٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
شَكْوَى an inf. n. of شَكَا, as also شَكْوًى; (K;) or<br>\
a simple subst. [signifying Complaint]: (S, Msb:)<br>\
pl. شَكَاوَى. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also شَكْوٌ.<br>\

Pained; syn. مُوجَعٌ; (K, TA;) in this sense an<br>\
instance of فَعِيلٌ in the sense of مَفْعُولٌ: (TA:)<br>\
or causing pain; syn. مُوجِعٌ: [thus accord. to<br>\
both of my copies of the S: and this appears to<br>\
be correct; for it is there immediately added,]<br>\
El-Tirimmáh says,<br>\
وَسْمِى شَكِىٌّ وَلِسَانِى عَارِمُ<br>\
[which is inconsiderately cited in the TA immediately after the former of these two explanations: I say “ inconsiderately ” because the<br>\
meaning evidently is, not that thus indicated in<br>\
the TA, but, My branding, or stigmatizing, by<br>\
satire, (for one says وَسَمَهُ بِالهِجَآءِ,) is such as<br>\
causes pain, and my tongue is vehement: or شَكِىٌّ<br>\
may here have the last but one of the meanings<br>\
expl. in this paragraph]: وَسْمِى is from السِّمَةُ.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Affected with a complaint, meaning<br>\
disease, malady, or sickness, [app. in an absolute<br>\
sense, (see شَكْوٌ,) and also] of the least, or lightest,<br>\

-b4-  And<br>\
i. q. ↓ مَشْكُوٌّ, (S, Msb, K,) which is a pass. part. n.<br>\
of شَكَا; [and therefore signifies Complained of;<br>\
and also complained to; but mostly seems to be<br>\
used in the former of these senses;] as also<br>\
↓ مَشْكِىٌّ. (S, Msb.)<br>\
شِكَايَةٌ an inf. n. of شَكَا; (S, K:) or a simple<br>\
subst., like شَكْوَى. (Msb.)<br>\
شَكِيَّةٌ an inf. n. of شَكَا. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And also (TA)<br>\
a subst. signifying A thing complained of (اِسْمٌ<br>\
لِمَشْكُوٍّ); like رَمِيَّةٌ a subst. signifying “ a thing<br>\
cast at or shot at ” (اِسْمٌ لِمَرْمِيٍّ): (Msb, TA:) pl.<br>\
شَكَايَا. (TA.)<br>\

thing: mentioned by Sgh. (TA.)<br>\
شُكَيَّةٌ dim. of شَكْوَةٌ, q. v. (TA.)<br>\
شَكِّىٌّ, (thus in copies of the K,) or شُكِّىٌّ, with<br>\
damm to the ش, (TA,) is mentioned in art. شك<br>\
[q. v.], and J has committed a mistake (K, TA)<br>\
in mentioning it here, as Sgh has observed:<br>\
(TA:) [accord. to F, it seems to be a rel. n.<br>\
applied to a bit, or bridle; for it is said to be so<br>\
applied in the K, as well as in the O, in art. شك,<br>\
in which both explain it as meaning Difficult;<br>\
and also to a skin; for immediately after asserting that J has committed a mistake, F adds,] and<br>\
شَكَّى, like حَتَّى, is a town in Armenia, whence<br>\
[are brought] bits, or bridles, (لُجُم,) and skins,<br>\
(K,) [and SM adds that they are termed شكّيّة:<br>\
but what I find J to have stated is as follows:]<br>\
الشَّكِىُّ, [thus in one of my copies of the S,] or<br>\
الشُكِى, [thus in the other of those copies,] in relation to weapons, is an arabicized word, and is in<br>\
Turkish لَش or لَشْ. (S. [But in the JM, this<br>\
last word is written, as from the S, تشن: it may<br>\
therefore be correctly لَشْن, or لَشِن, which, though<br>\
used in Turkish, is a Pers. word, meaning<br>\
smooth.])<br>\
شَاكٍ: see شَكِىٌّ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  In the phrase<br>\
رَجُلٌ شَاكِى السِّلَاحِ, (S,) which means A man<br>\
whose weapon is sharp, or whose weapons are<br>\
sharp, (S, K, *) Akh says that شاكى is formed<br>\
by transposition from شَائِك [q. v. in art. شوك]:<br>\
(S:) and accord. to AZ, one says also شَاكٍ فِى<br>\
السِّلاحِ. (TA in art. شوك.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And الشَّاكِى [is<br>\
app. formed in like manner from الشَّائِكُ, and]<br>\

مِشْكَاةٌ A niche in a wall; i. e. a hole, or hollow,<br>\
(كُوَّةٌ,) in a wall, not extending through; (Fr,<br>\
S, M, K, &amp;c.;) in which a lamp, placed therein,<br>\
gives more light than it does elsewhere: thus expl:<br>\
by the generality of the expositors [of the Kur-án];<br>\
and this is said by Ibn-&#39; Ateeyeh to be the most<br>\
correct explanation: (TA:) said by Aboo-Moosà to<br>\
mean the iron, or leaden, thing in which is the wick<br>\
[of the lamp]: thought by Az to mean the tube<br>\
which is the place of the wick in the glass lamp,<br>\
as being likened to the كُوَّة which is thus called:<br>\
(TA:) some expl. it as having this meaning in<br>\
the Kur xxiv. 35, and say that the مِصْبَاح there<br>\
mentioned is the lighted wick: (Bd:) accord. to<br>\
Mujáhid, the pillar, or the like, (العَمُود,) upon<br>\
the top, or head, of which the مِصْبَاح [meaning<br>\
lamp] is put: or the iron things by means of<br>\
which the قِنْدِيل [or lamp] is suspended: IJ says<br>\
that its ا is originally و, and hence it is [often]<br>\
written مِشْكٰوةٌ: and Zj says that it is an Abyssinian word, and used in the language of the<br>\
Arabs: (TA:) [the pl. is مَشَاكٍ, like مَسَاحٍ pl. of<br>\
مِسْحَاةٌ:] Kaab says that, in the verse of the Kur<br>\
[xxiv. 35], by the مِشْكَاة is meant the breast of<br>\
Mohammad; and by the مِصْبَاح, his tongue; and<br>\
by the زُجَاجَة, his mouth. (TA.)<br>\
مَشْكُوٌّ and مَشْكِىٌّ: see شَكِىٌّ, last sentence.<br>\
