شَخَرَ, aor.<br>\
شَخِرَ, inf. n. شَخِيرٌ (S, K) and شَخْرٌ,<br>\
(K,) He raised his voice, with snorting; said of<br>\
an ass: (S:) he uttered a sound from the fauces:<br>\
or from the nose: (K:) or from the mouth, without the nose: (TA:) he (a horse) neighed: (K:)<br>\
or uttered a sound after neighing: (TA:) or<br>\
uttered a sound from his mouth, (K, TA,) without<br>\
the nose: (TA:) As says that among the sounds<br>\
made by horses are those termed شَخِيرٌ and نَخِيرٌ<br>\
and كَرِيرٌ; the first of which is from the mouth;<br>\
the second, from the nostrils; and the third, from<br>\
the chest: some say that شَخَرَ is like نَخَرَ [he<br>\
snorted]. (TA.)<br>\
شَخْرٌ The first period or stage of youth; (K,<br>\
TA;) and the sharpness thereof; like شَرْخٌ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  The part, of a رَحْل [or camel&#39;s saddle], that<br>\
is between the قَادِمَة and the آخِرَة, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
which are the كَرَّانِ: (TA:) [said to be] also<br>\
called the شَرْخ, [which is an evident mistake,<br>\
perhaps originating from its having been said that<br>\
شَخْرٌ and شَرْخٌ are syn., meaning in another sense,<br>\
mentioned above,] (O, TA,) and the شَجْر [q. v.]:<br>\
(TA:) or the space between the upper part of the<br>\
two extremities [at the fore part and hind part]<br>\
of the [saddle called] قَتَب. (JK.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The<br>\
chink of the buttocks. (JK, O. [In the K, for<br>\
وَشَخْرُ الاِسْتِ شَقُّهَا, the reading in the JK and O,<br>\
is put وَشَخَرَ الاِسْتَ شَقَّهَا.])<br>\
شِخِّيرٌ That utters much, or often, the sound<br>\
termed نَخِير: (K:) or, as in some copies of the<br>\
K [and in the O], شَخِير: (TA:) [see نَخَرَ and<br>\
شَخَرَ:] applied to an ass in this sense, (O,) or as<br>\
signifying vociferous. (TA.)<br>\
