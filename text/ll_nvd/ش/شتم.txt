شَتَمَهُ, (MA, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
شَتِمَ (Msb, K)<br>\
and<br>\
شَتُمَ, (K,) inf. n. شَتْمٌ (S, MA, Msb, K) and<br>\
مَشْتَمَةٌ and مَشْتُمَةٌ, (K, TA,) the last of these<br>\
[written مَشْتِمَة in the CK] with damm to the ت,<br>\
or this and the next before it, though said to be<br>\
inf. ns., may be simple substantives, as A&#39;Obeyd<br>\
inclines to think them, (TA,) He reviled him,<br>\
vilified him, upbraided him, reproached him,<br>\
defamed him, or gave a bad name to him; (S, *<br>\
MA, K, TA;) syn. سَبَّهُ: (K, TA:) or, as some<br>\
say, شَتْمٌ signifies [the addressing with] foul<br>\
speech, without قَذْف [here meaning the casting<br>\
an accusation, though commonly used and expl.<br>\
as syn. with شَتْمٌ]: (TA:) and ↓ شاتمهُ signifies<br>\
the same as شَتَمَهُ, (MA, Msb,) being a rare instance of a verb of the measure فَاعَلَ denoting an<br>\
act of a single agent when it has an unaugmented<br>\
verb of the same radical letters [and the same<br>\
signification], as صَادَمَهُ الحِمَارُ meaning صَدَمَهُ,<br>\
and زَاحِمَهُ meaning زَحَمَهُ. (Msb.) Hence the<br>\
saying, فَإِنْ شُتِمَ فَلْيَعُلْ إِنِّى صَائِمٌ [And if he be<br>\
reviled, let him say, Verily I am fasting], which<br>\
may mean that he should say this with his tongue,<br>\
which is the more proper meaning, or mentally:<br>\
or ↓ فَإِنْ شُوتِمَ, which is allowable, though the<br>\
former is the more proper. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شاتمهُ<br>\
فَشَتَمَهُ: see 3.<br>\
-A2-  شَتُمَ, aor.<br>\
شَتُمَ, (S, K,) inf. n. شَتَامَةٌ<br>\
(S, IB) and شَتَمٌ, (IB, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He (a man, S)<br>\
was, or became, displeasing, or hateful, in countenance. (S, K.)<br>\
-A3-  [شَتِمَ, trans. by means of ب,<br>\
expl. by Golius as meaning He rejoiced at evils,<br>\
or misfortunes, of an enemy, is, I doubt not, a<br>\
mistake for شَمِتَ; though it might be supposed<br>\
to be formed by transposition, like جَبَذَ from<br>\
جَذَبَ.]<br>\
2<br>\
شتّم, accord. to Reiske, said of a camel<br>\
when haltered, and of a lion, as mentioned by<br>\
Freytag, signifies (assumed tropical:)  He was harsh, and surly, in<br>\
countenance, and uttered a grumbling sound: if<br>\
used, it must be شُتِّمَ, agreeably with the part. n.,<br>\
expl. below.]<br>\
3<br>\
مُشَاتَمَةٌ is syn. with مُسَابَّةٌ, (S,) signifying<br>\
The reviling, vilifying, upbraiding, reproaching,<br>\
defaming, or giving a bad name to, each other:<br>\
(KL:) and [in like manner] ↓ تَشَاتُمٌ is syn. with<br>\
تَسَابٌّ, (S,) signifying as above [but used in relation to two persons and more than two]: (KL:)<br>\
you say, شَاتَمَا and ↓ تَشَاتَمَا meaning تَسَابَّا [They<br>\
reviled, vilified, &amp;c., each other]: (K:) and<br>\
↓ تشاتموا They reviled, &amp;c., one another; like<br>\
تَسَابُّوا. (MA.) [شاتمهُ may therefore be rendered<br>\
He reviled him, &amp;c., being reviled, &amp;c., by him:<br>\
but sometimes it is syn. with شَتَمَهُ:] see 1, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, ↓ شَاتَمَهُ فَشَتَمَهُ, aor.<br>\
شَتُمَ,<br>\
meaning [He vied, or contended, with him in<br>\
reviling, vilifying, &amp;c.,] and he overcame him<br>\
[therein, i. e.] in reviling, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تشتّم is said by Freytag to signify He exposed himself to contumelies; on the authority of<br>\
the Ham p. 310: but I there find only the part. n.,<br>\
مُتَشَتِّمٌ, signifying as expl. below: so that the<br>\
verb, if used, means he became exasperated by<br>\
reviling, vilifying, &amp;c., and addressed, or applied,<br>\
himself thereto. ―<br>\
-b2-  He also explains it as signifying (assumed tropical:)  He contracted the face very austerely; on<br>\
the authority of the Deewán of the Hudhalees.]<br>\
6<br>\
تَشَاْتَمَ see 3, in three places.<br>\
شِتَامٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
شَتِيمٌ: see مَشْتُومٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Displeasing, or<br>\
hateful, in countenance; (S, K;) applied to a<br>\
man, and to a lion; (S;) and to an ass, as meaning thus, and foul, or ugly: (TA:) or to a lion<br>\
as meaning (tropical:)  grim-faced; or stern, austere, or<br>\
morose, in countenance; as also ↓ مُشَتَّمٌ; and<br>\
↓ شَتَّامَةٌ; (K, TA;) the last like جَبَّانَةٌ [in measure, but in the CK written شَتامَة]. (TA.) One<br>\
says, فُلَانٌ شَتِيمُ المُحَيَّا (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is displeasing,<br>\
or hateful, in countenance. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, and<br>\
↓ شِتَامٌ, An obstruction (سُدَّة) of the fauces, combined with foulness, or ugliness, of face. (TA.)<br>\
شَتِيمَةٌ a subst., (S, Msb, K, and Ksh in lxxiv.<br>\
41, [by Bd, in explaining the same passage of the<br>\
Kur, improperly said to be an inf. n.,]) from<br>\
شَتَمَهُ, (Msb, K,) in the sense of شَتْمٌ [meaning<br>\
The act of reviling, vilifying, or upbraiding; reproach, obloquy, or contumely]; (S, * and Ksh<br>\
ubi suprà;) as also ↓ مَشْتَمَةٌ, and ↓ مَشْتُمَةٌ, or, as<br>\
mentioned above, [see 1, first sentence,] these two<br>\
are inf. ns. (TA.)<br>\
شَتَّامٌ [One who reviles, &amp;c., much]. (Ham p.<br>\
310.)<br>\
شَتَّامَةٌ One who reviles, &amp;c., [very] much. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also شَتِيمٌ.<br>\
[<br>\
شَاتِمٌ act. part. n. of 1, Reviling, &amp;c. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is<br>\
also said by Golius, on the authority of the Mirkát<br>\
el-Loghah, to signify Rejoicing at another&#39;s evils,<br>\
or misfortunes: but this I believe to be a mistake<br>\
for شَامِتٌ: see 1, last sentence.]<br>\
الاشتيام, with kesr, [which seems to indicate<br>\
that it is الإِشْتِيَامُ,] is expl. by IB as meaning<br>\
رئيس الركاب [app. رَئِيسُ الرُّكَّابِ The headman,<br>\
or master, of the riders: but whence this is<br>\
derived I know not, unless it be arabicized, from<br>\
the Pers. أُسْتَا يَام (if there be such an appellation),<br>\
meaning “ the master of the post-horse ”]. (TA.)<br>\
مَشْتَمَةٌ and مَشْتُمَةٌ: see شَتِيمَةٌ.<br>\
مُشَتَّمٌ: see شَتِيمٌ; and see also مُشَبَّمٌ.<br>\
مَشْتُومٌ Reviled, vilified, upbraided, reproached,<br>\
defamed, or called by a bad name: and so with<br>\
ة applied to a female, as also ↓ شَتِيمٌ; (K, TA;)<br>\
this last, without ة, mentioned on the authority<br>\
of Lh. (TA.)<br>\
مُتَشَتِّمٌ Exasperated by reviling, &amp;c., and addressing, or applying, himself thereto. (Ham<br>\
p. 310: there expl. by the words متحكك بالشتم<br>\
ومعترض له [i. e. مُتَحَكِّكٌ بِالشَّتْمِ وَمُعْتَرِضٌ لَهُ:<br>\
see 5].)<br>\
