شَأَنْتُ شَأْنَهُ i. q. قَصَدْتُ قَصْدَهُ [meaning I<br>\
pursued his (another&#39;s) way, or course, doing as<br>\
he did]; (S, L, K: * in the K, شَأَنَ شَأْنَهُ and<br>\
قَصَدَ قَصْدَهُ;) and in like manner one says,<br>\
شَأْنَهُ ↓ اشتأن. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And اِشْأَنْ شَأْنَكَ Do thou<br>\
what thou dost well. (S, L, K. *) And Keep thou<br>\
to thy affair. (IAar, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And مَا شَأَنَ شَأْنَهُ<br>\
He did not know, or had not knowledge of, him,<br>\
or his affair or case or state: (Lh, IAar, L, K:)<br>\
[from a passage in the L, imperfectly written, it<br>\
seems, accord. to Lh, to be said of one who does<br>\
what another likes or dislikes, app. without<br>\
regard to his liking it or disliking it, agreeably<br>\
with what here follows:] or (K) this means, (S,<br>\
K,) or means also, (L,) he did not care for,<br>\
mind, heed, or regard, him. (S, L, K. [In the S<br>\
and L, the verb in the sense thus expl. is in the<br>\
first pers.: and in one place in the L it is expl.<br>\
by أَرَادَ, which often has this meaning.]) One<br>\
says also, لَأَشْأَننَّ شَأْنَهُمْ, meaning I will assuredly<br>\
know, or try, prove, or test, (لَأَخْبُرَنَّ,) their<br>\
affair or case or state: (L:) or this means I<br>\
will assuredly corrupt, or pervert, or mar, their<br>\
affair or case or state: (S, L, K: *) and لَأَشْأَنَنَّ<br>\
خَبَرَهُ, (L,) or خَبَرَهُمْ, (K,) means I will assuredly<br>\
know, or try, prove, or test, [his, or their, state,<br>\
or] him, or them. (L, K. [In the CK and in my<br>\
MS. copy of the K, لَاُخْبِرَنَّهُمْ, is erroneously put for<br>\
لَأَخْبُرَنَّهُمْ.])<br>\
-A2-  شَأَنَ بَعْدَكَ means صَارَ لَهُ شَأْنٌ [i. e.,<br>\
app., He became a person to whom importance<br>\
attached (accord. to the general meaning of لَهُ<br>\
شَأْنٌ) after thou knewest, or sawest, or mettest,<br>\
him; بَعْدَكَ being for بَعْدَ عَهْدِكَ بِهِ, agreeably<br>\
with common usage]. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اشأن شَأْنَهُمْ is mentioned by Golius as<br>\
meaning “ Corrupit ac pervertit rem eorum,”<br>\
as on the authority of the S, (the right reading in<br>\
which has been given above,) and on that of the<br>\
KL, in my copy of which I find nothing of the<br>\
sort.]<br>\
8<br>\
إِشْتَاَ^َ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
شَأْنٌ A thing, an affair, or a business; syn.<br>\
أَمْرٌ; (S, L, K;) and خَطْبٌ [in the same sense,<br>\
or in that next following]: (L, K:) a great<br>\
thing or affair: (Har p. 274:) state, condition,<br>\
case, quality, or manner of being; syn. حَالٌ: (S,<br>\
L:) [also property, or nature: and importance<br>\
attaching to a person or thing:] pl. شُؤُونٌ and<br>\
شِئَانٌ, (L, K,) the latter mentioned by IJ on the<br>\
authority of AAF, and شُونٌ occurs in poetry for<br>\
the former of these, or as another pl. originally<br>\
شُؤْنٌ, of the measure فُعْلٌ. (L.) It is said in the<br>\
Kur [lv. 29], كُلَّ يَم ٍ هُوَ فِى شَأْن ٍ [Every day<br>\
He is employing Himself in an affair of some<br>\
kind]: expl. as meaning that, of his business<br>\
(مِنْ شَأْنِهِ [which may also be rendered “ of his<br>\
property ”]) it is to render mighty one who is<br>\
brought low, and to bring low one who is<br>\
mighty, and to enrich one who is poor, and to<br>\
impoverish one who is rich; and no affair occupies him so as to divert him from an affair<br>\
(لَا يَشْعَلُهُ شَأْنٌ عَنْ شَأْن ٍ). (L.) [And one says,<br>\
مَا شَأْنُكَ What is thy affair? or what is thy case?<br>\
And شَأْنَكَ, for اِشْأَنْ شَأْنَكَ i. e. Pursue thy way<br>\
or course, or thy affair; or do what thou dost<br>\
well; or keep to thy affair: or the like: and to<br>\
this is often added, وَمَا تُرِيدُ i. e. and what thou<br>\
wilt, or wishest, or desirest. And مِنْ شَأْنِهِ أَنْ<br>\
يَفْعَلَ كَذَا It is of his business, or of his property, or nature, to do, or that he should do, such<br>\
a thing. And رَجُلٌ سَهْلُ الشَّأْنِ (a phrase occurring in the S and K in art. هش) A man of easy<br>\
nature. And لَهُ شَأْنٌ, sometimes meaning There<br>\
is for him, or he has, a great thing or affair to<br>\
perform or transact: but more commonly, great<br>\
importance attaches to him, or to it: see 1, last<br>\
sentence. And a grandee, or a prince, is said to<br>\
be عَظِيمُ الشَّأْنِ i. e. Of great importance or rank<br>\
or dignity.]<br>\
-A2-  Also [A suture of the skull; i. e.]<br>\
the place of junction of the قَبَائِل [or principal<br>\
bones, namely, the frontal, occipital, and two<br>\
parietal, bones,] of the head: (K:) sing. of<br>\
شُؤُونٌ, (Mgh,) which signifies the places of<br>\
junction, (As, S, Mgh, L,) and of meeting, (S,<br>\
L,) of the قَبَائِل (As, S, Mgh, L) of the head;<br>\
(S, L;) between every two of which قبائل is a<br>\
شَأْن: (As, L:) [it is fancifully said that] from<br>\
them come the tears: (As, S, L:) the pl. is also<br>\
expl. as meaning the سَلَاسِل [i. e. sutures as being<br>\
likened to the سلاسل (or lines) of writing] that<br>\
unite the قبائل: by Lth, as the نَمَانِم [likewise<br>\
meaning sutures resembling lines of writing] of<br>\
the skull; between the قبائل: by AHát, as the<br>\
شُعَب [meaning serrated edges] that unite the<br>\
قبائل of the head. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The channel by<br>\
which the tears flow, or run, to the eye: pl. [of<br>\
pauc.] أَشْؤُنٌ and [of mult.] شُؤُونٌ: (L, K:)<br>\
[perhaps thus called because supposed to come<br>\
from the sutures of the skull: but they may have<br>\
been supposed to come thence because tears are<br>\
called مَآءُ الشُّؤُونِ (as in a verse cited voce رَسَمَ);<br>\
for this phrase may have been misunderstood as<br>\
signifying “ the water of the sutures of the skull,”<br>\
whereas it seems to be properly rendered “ the<br>\
water of the channels of the tears: ”] it is said<br>\
that the شُؤُون connect the قبائل of the head<br>\
[expl. above] to the eye: Lth says that they are<br>\
the ducts (عُرُوق) of the tears from [the interior<br>\
of] the head to the eye: and Th, that they are<br>\
certain ducts (عروق) above the قبائل, which<br>\
become strong by degrees as the man advances in<br>\
age: (L: [but it seems that Th has confounded<br>\
explanations of شؤون in two different senses:])<br>\
accord. to ISk, (S,) or AA and others, (L,) the<br>\
شَأْنَانِ are two ducts (عِرْقَانِ) descending from [the<br>\
upper part of] the head to the eyebrows and then<br>\
to the eyes. (S, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [The pl. شُؤُونٌ is also<br>\
expl. as though meaning Tears themselves, in a<br>\
phrase mentioned voce ذَئِرٌ (q. v.), on the authority of the K.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And شُؤُونٌ الخَمْرِ means (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
effluvia of wine that creep (مَا دَبَّ مِنَ الخَمْرِ)<br>\
in the veins of the body. (L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  شَأْنٌ also signifies A vein of earth in a mountain, (L, K,) i. e.<br>\
a cleft therein, (L,) in which palm-trees are<br>\
planted; (L, K;) or in which trees of the kind<br>\
called نَبْع grow; or that produces plants, or herbage: (L:) pl. شُؤُونٌ: (L, K:) which is said<br>\
by ISd to mean lines, or streaks, in a mountain:<br>\
or, as some say, cracks, or clefts: and to these<br>\
cracks, or clefts, the poet Keys Ibn-Kuráa likens<br>\
[imaginary] clefts in the liver, occasioned by<br>\
love. (L.)<br>\
إِنَّهُ لَمِشْأَنُ شَأْن ٍ أَنْ نُفْسِدَكَ is a saying mentioned by Lh, expl. [only] by the words اى ان<br>\
نعمل فى فسادك [i. e. أَنْ نَعْمَلَ فِى فَسَادِكَ, app.<br>\
meaning Verily he is busying himself in the doing<br>\
of a thing in order that we may labour in causing<br>\
thee to be in a bad, or corrupt, state]. (L.)<br>\
