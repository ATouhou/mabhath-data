شَآءَنِى, formed by transposition from شَآنِى,<br>\
aor. يَشُوْءُ and يَشِىْءُ, [but the latter form of the<br>\
aor. is disallowed by MF,] He preceded me, or<br>\
outwent me. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  And He grieved me. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And He pleased me. (K.) Thus it bears two<br>\
contr. significations. (TA.) And شُؤْتُهُ, aor.<br>\
أَشُوْؤُهُ, I pleased him. (Lth, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And شُؤْتُ بِهِ I<br>\
was pleased with, and rejoiced in, him, or it.<br>\
(Lth, O, K.) [See also art. شأو.]<br>\
شَآءٌ, n. un. شَاةٌ: see art. شوه.<br>\
شَيِّآنٌ, (K, TA, and L in art. تيح,) in form like<br>\
the dual of سَيِّدٌ [except as to the final vowel],<br>\
(TA,) [erroneously written in the CK شَيْئاٰن,]<br>\
and شَيَّآنٌ, like تَيِّحَانٌ and تَيَّحَانٌ [q. v.], (L in<br>\
art. تيح,) [applied to a man,] Far-sighted; (K;)<br>\
either in the proper sense, or metonymically applied to a man characterized by deliberation, and<br>\
reflection, and looking to the results of affairs.<br>\
(TA.) Each is also applied as an epithet to a<br>\
horse. (L in art. تيح.) [The radical letters of<br>\
this epithet are either شوأ or شيأ; therefore it is<br>\
mentioned again in art. شيأ; and another form<br>\
thereof, without ء, (شَيَّان,) is mentioned in art.<br>\
شوى.]<br>\
