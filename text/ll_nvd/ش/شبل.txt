شَبَلَ, (K,) aor.<br>\
شَبُلَ, (TK,) inf. n. شُبُولٌ, He<br>\
(a boy, TA) became a youth, or young man, (K,)<br>\
or grew up, and became a youth, or young man,<br>\
(TA,) in a state of ease and plenty. (K, TA.<br>\
[In the CK, فى نِعْمَة ٍ is erroneously put for فى<br>\
نَعْمَة ٍ.]) Accord. to Ks, one says, شَبَلْتُ فِى بَنِى<br>\
فُلَان ٍ, meaning I grew up, or became a youth, or<br>\
young man, among the sons of such a one: (S,<br>\
TA:) and قَدْ شَبَلَ الغُلَامُ أَحْسَنَ شُبُول ٍ The boy<br>\
has grown up, or become a youth, or young man,<br>\
in the best manner: (S:) but accord. to others,<br>\
it is not said except in the case of being in a state<br>\
of ease and plenty. (TA.)<br>\

أَشْبَلَتِ المَرْأَةُ بَعْدَ بَعْلِهَا (assumed tropical:)  The woman bore<br>\
with her children, [tending them patiently, after<br>\
the loss of her husband,] without marrying: (S,<br>\
O:) [and] اشبلت عَلَى وَلَدِهَا (tropical:)  She (a woman)<br>\
applied herself constantly to the care of her children, after [the loss of] her husband, (K, TA,)<br>\
and bore with them, (TA,) not marrying: (K,<br>\
TA:) and the epithet applied to her is ↓ مُشْبِلٌ<br>\
[without ة]. (TA.) One says, هِىَ فِى إِشْبَالِهَا<br>\
كَاللَّبُوَةِ عَلَى أَشْبَالِهَا (tropical:)  [She is, in her constant<br>\
application of herself to the care of her children,<br>\
&amp;c., like the lioness over her whelps]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And اشبل عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  He inclined to him; affected<br>\
him; or was, or became, favourably inclined<br>\
towards him: (S, O, K, TA:) and he aided,<br>\

انشبل is expl. by Golius as signifying<br>\
“Leviter e loco exivit, effluxit;” as on the authority of the KL; but I do not find it in my copy<br>\
of that work; and think that it is some other<br>\
word to which this meaning is there assigned.]<br>\
شِبْلٌ The whelp, or young one, of the lion:<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb:) or the young one of the lion<br>\
when it has attained to the seeking, or taking, of<br>\
prey: (K, TA:) [and Freytag says, on the authority of Meyd, of any wild beast:] pl. أَشْبَالٌ<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K) and أَشْبُلٌ (S, O, K) [both properly pls. of pauc.] and [pl. of mult.] شُبُولٌ and<br>\
شِبَالٌ. (K.)<br>\
شَابِلٌ A lion whose canine teeth have become<br>\
such as lock together, dissimilar; expl. by the<br>\
words اَلَّذِى اشْتَبَكَتْ أَنْيَابُهُ. (K. [Perhaps, in this<br>\
sense, a mistranscription for شَابِكٌ, q. v.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
(K) (assumed tropical:)  A boy, or young man, full [or plump] in<br>\
body, by reason of ease and plenty and of youthfulness: (IAar, O, K: *) and so شَابِنٌ, and<br>\
حِضَجْرٌ. (IAar, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [شَابِلَةٌ, expl. by Golius<br>\
as signifying “Diminuta lacte camela, pulli<br>\
septimestris mater,” as on the authority of the<br>\
KL, is a mistake for شَائِلَةٌ.]<br>\
[<br>\
أَشْبَلُ, expl. by Golius as signifying “Magno<br>\
veretri præputio camelus,” as on the authority of<br>\
the KL, is a mistake for أَثْيَلُ.]<br>\
مُشْبِلٌ A lioness whose whelps, or young ones,<br>\
accompany her, (S, O, Msb,) going with her.<br>\
(S, O.) And A she-camel whose young one has<br>\
become strong, and goes with her. (AZ, S, O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also 4.<br>\
مَشْبُولٌ A place in which are lions&#39; whelps or<br>\
young ones. (Ham p. 416.)<br>\
