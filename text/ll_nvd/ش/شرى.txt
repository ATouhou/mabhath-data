شَرَاهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
شَرِىَ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. شِرًى (S, Mgh, Msb, TA) and شِرَآءٌ,<br>\
(S, * Mgh, Msb, * TA,) the former inf. n. the more<br>\
in repute, (Msb, TA,) and this is of the dial. of<br>\
Nejd, the latter being of the dial. of El-Hijáz, or<br>\
the latter may be said to be with medd for the<br>\
purpose of assimilating it to a preceding word,<br>\
accord. to El-Munádee, or it may be regarded as<br>\
an inf. n. of شَارَاهُ, (TA,) i. q. بَاعَهُ [in the sense<br>\
in which this is generally used, i. e. He sold it];<br>\
(S, Mgh, K;) he gave it for a price: (Msb:) and<br>\
i. q. ↓ اِشْتَرَاهُ [in the sense in which this is generally<br>\
used, i. e. he bought it]; (S, Mgh;) i. e. شَرَاهُ signifies also he took it, or acquired it, for a price:<br>\
(Msb:) or this and ↓ اشتراه both signify بَاعَهُ [as<br>\
meaning he sold it]; (T, * K, TA;) but the former<br>\
is more used than the latter in this sense: (T,<br>\
TA:) and both signify also [he bought it; i. e.]<br>\
he possessed it by sale; (K;) which is the more<br>\
usual meaning of the latter: (T, TA:) thus the<br>\
former has two contr. meanings, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
and the latter also: (K:) for the two persons<br>\
selling and buying sell and buy the price and the<br>\
thing upon which the price is put; so that each of<br>\
the things given in exchange is sold in one point<br>\
of view and bought in another. (Msb, TA.) It<br>\
is said in the Kur [ii. 203], وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَنْ يَشْرِى<br>\
نَفْسَهُ ابْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاةِ اللّٰهِ i. e. [And of men is he]<br>\
who sells [himself in the endeavour to obtain the<br>\
approval of God]. (S, * TA.) And in the same,<br>\
[xii. 20], وَشَرَوْهُ بِثَمَنٍ بَخْسٍ i. e. And they sold<br>\
him [for a deficient, or an insufficient, price].<br>\
(S, TA.) And in the same [ii. 15], أُولَائِكَ الَّذِينَ<br>\
الضَّلَالَةَ بِالْهُدَى ↓ اشْتَرَوُا, originally اشْتَرَيُوا, (S,)<br>\
[lit. Those are they who have purchased error<br>\
with right direction,] meaning, (tropical:)  who have taken<br>\
الضلالة in exchange for الهدى: (Ksh, Bd, Jel:)<br>\
or (tropical:)  who have preferred الضلالة to الهدى: (Ksh,<br>\
Bd:) [for] of any one who relinquishes a thing<br>\
and lays hold upon another thing, one says اشتراه;<br>\
(K, TA;) which is thus tropically used [as meaning (tropical:)  he took it in exchange بِغَيْرِهِ by giving up<br>\
another thing]; (TA;) and hence this saying in<br>\
the Kur-án. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] شَرَى بِنَفْسِهِ<br>\
عَنِ القَوْمِ (tropical:)  He advanced before the people, or<br>\
party, (K, TA,) to their enemy, (TA,) and fought<br>\
in defence of them: or (tropical:)  he advanced to the<br>\
Sultán, and spoke for the people: (K, TA:) [as<br>\
though he sold himself for them; the ب in بنفسه<br>\
being app. redundant:] or, as in the Tekmileh,<br>\
شَرَى بِنَفْسِهِ إِلَى القَوْمِ (tropical:)  he advanced to the people,<br>\
or party, and fought them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And شَرَى<br>\
فُلَانًا, (K,) inf. n. شِرًى, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He mocked at,<br>\
scoffed at, laughed at, derided, or ridiculed, such<br>\
a one: (K:) [and] so ↓ شَرَّاهُ. (TA voce جَدَّعَهُ<br>\
[q. v.: thus there written, perhaps for the purpose<br>\
of assimilating it to جَدَّعَهُ].) ―<br>\
-b4-  And i. q. أَرْغَمَهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [He angered such a one; or did evil to him,<br>\
and angered him]: (Lh, K, TA:) and so أَوْرَمَهُ,<br>\
and غَطَاهُ [or perhaps عَظَاهُ, for both are expl.<br>\
alike]: all said of God. (Lh, TA.) And فَعَلَ<br>\
بِهِ مَا شَرَاهُ (assumed tropical:)  He did to him that which occasioned<br>\
evil to him; or that which displeased, grieved, or<br>\
vexed, him; syn. سَآءَهُ. (TA.) And لَحَاهُ اللّٰهُ وَشَرَاهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [May God remove him far from good or prosperity, or curse him, and do evil to him, or displease or grieve or vex him]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شَرَى اللّٰهُ<br>\
فُلَانًا, (K,) inf. n. شِرًى, (TA,) also signifies God<br>\
smote him, or may God smite him, with the<br>\
eruption termed شَرًى [q. v.]. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And<br>\
شَرَاهُ, (K,) aor.<br>\
شَرِىَ, inf. n. شِرًى, (TA,) i. q. شَرَّرَهُ,<br>\
(K, TA,) i. e. He spread it [to dry]; (TA;) [in<br>\
copies of the K, in art. شر, written, in this sense,<br>\
↓ شَرَّاهُ;] namely, flesh-meat, and a garment, or<br>\
piece of cloth, and [the preparation of curd called]<br>\
أَقِط. (K.)<br>\
-A4-  شَرِىَ, aor.<br>\
شَرَىَ, inf. n. شَرًى, (S, K,)<br>\
said of lightning, (S, K, &amp;c.,) It shone, or<br>\
gleamed, much: (S:) or it shone, or gleamed,<br>\
(K, TA,) and spread in the face of the clouds, or,<br>\
as in the T, became dispersed in the face of the<br>\
clouds: (TA:) and ↓ اشرى signifies the same;<br>\
(K;) or it shone, or gleamed, consecutively: the<br>\
latter verb mentioned by Sgh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
hence, (S,) said of the nose-rein of a camel, (S,<br>\
TA,) It was, or became, in a state of commotion,<br>\
(TA,) or, of much commotion. (S, TA.) [See<br>\
also 12.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (K,) aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
(TA,) He (a man) was, or became, angry: (K,<br>\
TA:) or he was, or became, flurried by reason of<br>\
anger. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And, said of evil, or mischief, It spread, بَيْنَهُمْ among them: (K, TA:) or<br>\
became great, or formidable; and in like manner<br>\
said of an affair, or event. (Nh, TA. [See also<br>\
10.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also, and ↓ استشرى, He (a man, S)<br>\
persisted, or persevered, (S, K,) in an affair, (S,)<br>\
or in his error, and his corrupt conduct: and the<br>\
former, said of a man, is like غَرِىَ in measure<br>\
and meaning [i. e. he persisted, or persevered, in<br>\
his anger]. (TA.) One says of a horse, شَرِىَ فِى<br>\
سَيْرِهِ, (S, K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) He per-<br>\
sisted, or persevered, in his pace, or going; as also<br>\
↓ استشرى: (S:) or he exceeded the usual bounds<br>\
therein, (K, TA,) and went on without languor:<br>\
(TA:) and فِى عَدْوِهِ ↓ استشرى he (i. e. a horse)<br>\
persisted, or persevered, in his running: (Mgh:)<br>\
and شَرِىَ فِى لِجَامِهِ he (a horse) strained his<br>\
bridle. (A, TA.) And شَرِيَتْ عَيْنُهُ بِالدَّمْعِ His<br>\
eye persisted, or persevered, in the shedding of<br>\
tears, the tears pouring forth consecutively.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A5-  And شَرِىَ, (S, K, TA,) aor.<br>\
شَرَىَ, inf. n.<br>\
شَرًى, (K, * TA,) He, (TA,) or his skin, broke<br>\
out with the eruption termed شَرًى [q. v.]. (S,<br>\

2<br>\
شَرَّىَ see the preceding paragraph, in two places.<br>\
3<br>\
شَارَاهُ, inf. n. مُشَارَاةٌ and شِرَآءٌ, i. q. بَايَعَهُ [as<br>\
signifying He sold and bought with him: and he<br>\
bartered, or exchanged commodities, with him:<br>\
that شاراه has both of these meanings (like بايعه)<br>\
is shown by the fact that مُشَارَاةٌ is also expl. in<br>\
the TA, on the authority of Er-Rághib, as signifying the same as قِبَاضٌ]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (Mgh,)<br>\
inf. n. مُشَارَاةٌ, (TA,) He persisted in contention,<br>\
litigation, or wrangling: (Mgh:) one says, هُوَ<br>\
يُشَارِيهِ (T, M, K) He persists in contention, litigation, or wrangling, with him: (M, TA:) or he<br>\
contends in altercation, disputes, or litigates, with<br>\
him; or does so vehemently, or obstinately; syn.<br>\
يُجَادِلُهُ: (K, TA:) and it is said of the Prophet,<br>\
in a trad., كَانَ لَا يُشَارِى وَلَا يُمَارِى [He used not<br>\
to persist in contention, &amp;c.]: (Mgh, TA:) meaning accord. to Th, بِالشَّرِّ ↓ كَانَ لَا يَسْتَشْرِى [he<br>\
used not to persist, or persevere, with evil conduct]: (TA:) from اِسْتَشْرَى فِى عَدْوِهِ [expl. above<br>\
(see 1 near the end)] as said of a horse: (Mgh:)<br>\
or, accord. to Az, (TA,) originally يُشَارِرُ; one of<br>\
the رs being changed into ى. (K, * TA. [See 3<br>\
in art. شر: and see also 3 in art. جرى.])<br>\
4<br>\
اشرى, said of lightning: see 1, latter half.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Said of a camel, He sped, or went quickly.<br>\
(IKtt, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اشرى بَيْنَهُمْ He excited discord,<br>\
strife, or animosity, between them, or among them.<br>\
(Az, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اشرى الحَمَلُ (K accord. to the CK,<br>\
[which, I think, evidently gives the right reading,]<br>\
in the TA and in my MS. copy of the K الجمل,)<br>\
i. q. تَفَلَّقَتْ عَقِيقَتُهُ [i. e. The lamb had its wool<br>\
cleaving open, or becoming cleft]: (K: [Freytag,<br>\
following the TK, and reading الحِمْلُ, explains<br>\
the verb as said of fruit, and meaning “ diffissos<br>\
habuit nucleos; ” but I cannot find any authority<br>\
for the signification that he thus assigns to عَقيقة:])<br>\
mentioned by Sgh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  اشرت الشَّجَرَةُ The<br>\
plant [crept upon the ground, or] was like the<br>\

اشرى جَفْنَةً he filled a bowl, (S,) or جِفَانَهُ his<br>\
bowls for the guests. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He made it<br>\
to incline, (K, TA,) فِى نَاحِيَةِ كَذَا [in the direction of such a thing]. (TA.) Hence the saying of a poet,<br>\
وَأَنَّنِى حَيْثُمَا يُشْرِى الهَوَى بَصَرِى<br>\
مِنْ حَوْثَمَا سَلَكُوا أَدْنُو فَأَنْظُورُ<br>\
[And that I, wherever love makes my eye, or<br>\
eyes, to incline, wherever they travel, approach<br>\
and look: فانظور being for فَأَنْظُرُ]: or, as some<br>\
relate it, أَثْنِى فَأَنْظُورُ [i. e. turn myself, or my<br>\
eyes, and look]. (TA.) ―<br>\

motion; namely, a bridle. (Freytag, from the<br>\
Deewán of the Hudhalees.)]<br>\

leaves thereof. (TA.) One says, هُوَ أَحْلَى مِنَ<br>\
الأَرْىِ وَأَمَرُّ مِنَ الشَّرْىِ [He, or it, is sweeter than<br>\
honey and more bitter than colocynth]. (TA.)<br>\
And فُلَانٌ لَهُ طَعْمَانِ أَرْىٌ وَشَرْىٌ [Such a one has<br>\
two flavours, that of honey and that of colocynth].<br>\
(S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Any kind of plant that spreads<br>\
upon the ground, running [or creeping] and extending; such as the melon and the cucumber.<br>\
(AHn, O voce سُطَّاحٌ, q. v., and TA * in the present<br>\
art.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Palm-trees that grow from the datestones: (K:) and with ة [as the n. un.] one of such<br>\

worse, or worst, of cattle: accord. to J, [in the<br>\
S,] ↓ شَرْىٌ, [said in the S to be like شَوَى المَالِ,]<br>\

and the good, or better, or best, thereof; as also<br>\
↓ شَرَاةٌ: thus having two contr. significations:<br>\
(K:) and so says ISk: but ISd says that إِبِلٌ<br>\

dirhems: (TA:) or small pimples or purulent<br>\

body: (K, TA:) thus in the “ Kánoon ” of Ibn-Seenà [or Avicenna]. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  ذُو الشَّرَى A<br>\
certain idol of [the tribe of] Dows (دَوْس), (K,<br>\

(TA,) [when used as a simple subst., signifying<br>\
A sale and also a purchase,] has أَشْرِيَةٌ for its pl.,<br>\
which, as pl. of a sing. of the measure فِعَلٌ, is<br>\
anomalous. (S, TA.)<br>\
شَرَاةٌ: see شَرًى, in two places.<br>\
شَرَآءٌ: see شَرًى.<br>\

it is in تَقْوَى and the like, (TA,) The like (S, K)<br>\
of a thing: (S:) because a thing is sometimes<br>\
bought with the like thereof: (TA:) [used alike<br>\
as sing. and pl.: and, accord. to the TA, it seems<br>\
that ↓ شَرْىٌ signifies the same.] It is said of<br>\
Shureyh, كَانَ يُضَمِّنُ القَصَّارَ شَرْوَى الثَّوْبِ الَّذِى<br>\
أَهْلَكَهُ [He used to make the washer responsible<br>\
for the like of the garment, or piece of cloth, that<br>\
he destroyed]. (TA.) And it is said in a trad. of<br>\
&#39;Omar, relating to the [collecting of the] poorrate, فَلَا يَأْخُذُ إِلَّا تِلْكَ السِّنَّ مِنْ شَرْوَى إِبِلِهِ [i. e.<br>\

شَرْيَانٌ see شَرْىٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see what next follows.<br>\
شِرْيَانٌ and ↓ شَرْيَانٌ, (S, K,) the former of which<br>\
is the more in repute, (TA,) the former said to be<br>\
quasi-quadriliteral, like جِرْيَالٌ, [and therefore<br>\
mentioned also in the TA in art. شرن,] but held<br>\
by IB to be of the measure فِعْلَانٌ, (TA in art.<br>\
شرن,) A kind of tree, (S, K, TA,) of the عِضَاه<br>\
[q. v.] of the mountains, (TA,) of which bows are<br>\
made: (S, K, TA:) n. un. with ة: the tree thus<br>\
called grows in the manner, and of the height and<br>\
width, of the [species of lote-tree called] سِدْر, and<br>\
has a yellow, sweet نَبِقَة [or drupe]: so says AHn:<br>\
and he adds, Aboo-Ziyád says, bows are made of<br>\
the شريان, and the bow made thereof is good, but<br>\
black tinged with redness; its wood being of those<br>\
woods of which good bows are [commonly] made;<br>\
and they assert that it seldom, or never, becomes<br>\
crooked: Mbr says that the نَبْع and شَوْحَط [q. v.]<br>\
and شريان are one kind of tree, but differing in<br>\
name and estimation according to the places of<br>\
growth; such thereof as is upon the summit of the<br>\
mountain being the نبع; and such as is at the base,<br>\
or foot, or lowest or lower part, thereof, the<br>\
شريان. (TA. [But see شَوْحَطٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also sing. of<br>\
شَرَايِينُ signifying The arteries; i. e. the pulsing veins; (S, K;) which spring from the<br>\
heart: (S:) but the anatomists assert that they<br>\
spring from the liver, and pass by the heart.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  شِرْيَانٌ, with kesr, signifies also A crack,<br>\
or fissure, [in a rock,] such as is termed ثَتٌّ.<br>\
(Az, TA.)<br>\
شِرَائِىٌّ: see شِرَوِىٌّ.<br>\
شَارٍ Selling, or a seller: (Mgh, TA:) and<br>\
buying, or a buyer: as also ↓ مُشْتَرٍ [in both senses,<br>\
but generally in the latter sense; whereas شَارٍ is<br>\
generally used in the former sense]: (TA:) pl. of<br>\
the former شُرَاةٌ. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S, TA,) and<br>\
↓ شَارِىٌّ, in which latter the ى is not the ى of a<br>\
rel. n. but is an affix corroborative of the epithet,<br>\
as in the cases of أَحْوَرُ and أَحْوَرِىٌّ [or أَحْمَرُ and<br>\
أَحْمَرِىٌّ] and صُلَّبٌ and صُلَّبِىٌّ, (TA,) One of the<br>\
people to whom is applied the appellation الشُّرَاةُ,<br>\
(S, TA,) which means the [heretics, or schismatics, commonly known by the name of] خَوَارِج<br>\
[pl. of خَارِجِىٌّ, q. v.]: (S, M, Mgh, K, &amp;c.:) so<br>\
called because they said, We have sold ourselves<br>\
in obedience to God, i. e., for Paradise, when we<br>\
separated ourselves from the erring Imáms: (S:)<br>\
or because they sold themselves for the sake of<br>\
what they believed: or because they said, Verily<br>\
God has purchased us and our possessions:<br>\
(Mgh:) but ISk says, because of their vehement<br>\
hatred of the Muslims: and the author of the K<br>\
says that it is from شَرِىَ signifying “ he was<br>\
angry,” and “ he persisted, or persevered; ” and<br>\
he charges J with error in his explaining it as<br>\
above, from their saying “ we have sold ourselves ” &amp;c.; but this charge is senseless, for J<br>\
has followed herein more than one of the leading<br>\
authorities: the author of the K has followed ISd,<br>\
who, however, adds, as to themselves, they say<br>\
“ We are the شُرَاة ” because of the saying in the<br>\
Kur ii. 203 [cited in the first paragraph of this<br>\
art.], and the saying [in ix. 112] “ Verily God<br>\
hath purchased, of the believers, themselves ”<br>\
