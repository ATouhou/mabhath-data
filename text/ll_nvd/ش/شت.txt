شَتٌّ an inf. n. of 1 [q. v.] (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And signifying Separation, disunion, or dispersion: so in the saying, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِى جَمَعَنَا مِنْ<br>\
شَتٍّ [Praise be to God who has brought us<br>\
together from a state of separation, disunion, or<br>\
dispersion]: (TA:) a saying mentioned by AA,<br>\
as heard by him from an Arab of the desert:<br>\
(S, TA:) and ↓ شَتَاتٌ is [similar in meaning,<br>\
being] likewise an inf. n. of 1; (S, A, K;) or it<br>\
is a subst. from the intrans. verb شَتَّ, (Msb,) and<br>\
signifies a state of separation or disunion; as in<br>\
the saying, أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمُ الشَّتَاتَ [I fear for you<br>\
separation, or disunion]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q.<br>\
مُتَفَرِّقٌ [meaning Dissolved, broken up, discomposed, deranged, disorganized, disordered, or unsettled; and separated, disunited, dispersed, or<br>\
scattered]; as also ↓ شَتِيتٌ, (S, A, Msb,) [and<br>\
↓ شَتَاتٌ, as will be shown in what follows;] or<br>\
↓ شَتِيتٌ is syn. with مُفَرَّقٌ, [which is virtually the<br>\
same as مُتَفَرِّقٌ,] and مُشَتَّتٌ: (K:) the pl. of شَتٌّ<br>\
is أَشْتَاتٌ (S) [and شُتُوتٌ also, as will be shown by<br>\
an ex. in what follows]: and ↓ شَتَّى is pl. of<br>\
↓ شَتِيتٌ, like as مَرْضَى is of مَرِيضٌ; (Jel in xx.<br>\
55, and MF;) or, accord. to some, it is a sing.<br>\
noun. (MF.) One says أَمْرٌ شَتٌّ i. e. مُتَفَرِّقٌ [A<br>\
state of affairs dissolved, broken up, &amp;c.]; (S;)<br>\
and [so] ↓ أَمْرٌ شَتَاتٌ, the latter word being an<br>\
inf. n. used as an epithet. (Ham p. 176.) And<br>\
↓ صَارَ جَمْعُهُمْ شَتِيتًا i. e. مُتَفَرِّقًا [Their company, or<br>\
congregated body, became separated, disunited,<br>\
dispersed, or scattered]. (A.) And جَاؤُوا أَشْتَاتًا<br>\
They came separated, disunited, dispersed, or<br>\
scattered; syn. مُتَفَرِّقِينَ: (S, Msb, K:) and so<br>\
↓ جاؤوا شَتَاتَ شَتَاتَ, (K,) in one copy of the K<br>\
شَتَاتَ وَشَتَاتَ; and MF allows ↓ شُتَاتَ, like ثُلَاثَ<br>\
and رُبَاعَ; but there is no apparent reason for the<br>\
repetition; and accord. to the L, the phrase as<br>\
transmitted from the authorities worthy of confidence is ↓ جَآءَ القَوْمُ شَتَاتًا and شَتَاتَ i. e. The<br>\
people, or party, came separated, &amp;c. (TA.) And<br>\
↓ قَوْمٌ شَتَّى (S, Msb, K, TA) A people, or party,<br>\
separated, &amp;c.; syn. مُتَفَرِّقُونَ: (Msb, TA:) or<br>\
consisting of sundry, or distinct, bodies; not of one<br>\
tribe. (K.) And إِنَّ المَجْلِسَ لَيَجْمَعُ شُتُوتًا مِنَ<br>\
النَّاسِ, (S, TA,) and مِنَ النَّاسِ ↓ شَتَّى, Verily the<br>\
assembly comprises sundry, or distinct, bodies of<br>\
men; (TA;) or men not of one tribe. (S TA.)<br>\
And ↓ أَشْيَآءُ شَتَّى [Things of sundry, or different,<br>\
or distinct, kinds or sorts]. (S.) أَزْوَاجًا مِنْ نَبَاتٍ<br>\
↓ شَتَّى, in the Kur xx. 55, means Sorts, of plants,<br>\
various, or different, in colours, tastes, &amp;c. (Jel.)<br>\
↓ أُمَّهَاتُهُمْ شَتَّى see expl. voce أُمٌّ. And تَؤُوبُ ↓ شَتَّى<br>\

شَتَاتٌ and شَتَاتَ and شَتَاتًا: see شَتٌّ, in five<br>\
places.<br>\
شُتَاتَ: see شَتٌّ.<br>\
شَتِيتٌ: see شَتٌّ, in four places. ثَغْرٌ شَتِيتٌ<br>\
means [Fore teeth] separate, or wide-apart, one<br>\
from another. (S, A, K.) Tarafeh says,<br>\
مِنْ شَتِيتٍ كَأَقَاحِ الرَّمْلِ غُرْ<br>\
[meaning From separate fore teeth like white<br>\
chamomiles of the sands: ثَغْرٍ being understood,<br>\
and غُرْ being for غُرٍّ]. (TA.)<br>\
شَتَّى: see شَتٌّ, in seven places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see<br>\
also the last sentence of the following paragraph.<br>\
شَتَّانَ بَيْنُهُمَا, (K, TA, but omitted in the CK,)<br>\
with damm to the ن of بين, (TA,) [Different,<br>\
or distinct, are they two: or widely different or<br>\
distinct are they two: or how very, or widely,<br>\
different or distinct, are they two! lit., the union<br>\
of them two is severed: or the interval between<br>\
them two is far-extending, or wide: or how<br>\
greatly is the union of them two severed! as will<br>\
be shown below.] AZ quotes, in his “ Nawádir,”<br>\
with بين in the nom. case, the following verse:<br>\
شَتَّانَ بَيْنُهُمَا فِى كُلِّ مَنْزِلَةٍ<br>\
هٰذَا يَخَافُ وَهٰذَا يَرْتَجِى أَبَدَا<br>\
[Different, or widely different, &amp;c., are they two<br>\
in every predicament: this fears, and this hopes,<br>\
ever]. (TA.) The mansoob form, however, is<br>\
also employed (K, TA, but omitted in the CK)<br>\
by some of the Arabs in the above-mentioned<br>\
phrase, so that one says, شَتَّانَ بَيْنَهُمَا, مَا being<br>\
understood, as though one said, شَتَّ الَّذِى بَيْنَهُمَا<br>\
[meaning, as above explained, Different, or<br>\
widely different, &amp;c., are they two: lit., separated, or disunited, or severed, is that which is<br>\
between them two: or far-extending, or wide, is<br>\
the interval between them two: or how greatly<br>\
separated, or severed, is the union between them<br>\
two!]: Hassán Ibn-Thábit says,<br>\
وَشَتَّانَ بَيْنَكُمَا فِى النَّدَى<br>\
وَفِى البَأْسِ وَالخُبْرِ وَالمَنْظَرِ<br>\
[And different, or widely different, &amp;c., are ye<br>\
two in munificence and in valour and internal<br>\
state and external appearance]. (TA.) In like<br>\
manner also, [but with ما,] one says, شَتَّانَ مَا بَيْنَهُمَا,<br>\
(A, Msb, K,) accord. to Th. (TA.) This [as also,<br>\
consequently, the same phrase without ما] is<br>\
disallowed by As and IKt: IB, however,<br>\
says that this phrase occurs in the verses of<br>\
chaste Arabs: for instance, Abu-l-Aswad EdDuälee says,<br>\
وَشَتَّانَ مَا بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكَ إِنَّنِى<br>\
عَلَى كُلِّ حَالٍ أَسْتَقِيمُ وَتَظْلَعُ<br>\
[And different, or widely different, &amp;c., are I<br>\
and thou: for I, in every case, go erect, and thou<br>\
haltest]: and similar is the saying of El-Ba&#39;eeth,<br>\
وَشَتَّانَ مَا بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَ ابْنِ خَالِدٍ<br>\
أُمَيَّةَ فِى الرِّزْقِ الَّذِى يَتَقَسَّمُ<br>\
[And different, or widely different, &amp;c., are I<br>\
and Ibn-Khálid Umeiyeh, with respect to the<br>\
supplies for the wants of life that are divided<br>\
among mankind]. (TA.) One says also, شَتَّانَ<br>\
مَا هُمَا; (S, A, K;) and شَتَّانَ مَا عَمْرٌو وَأَخُوهُ; (S,<br>\
K;) Different, or distinct, or widely different, &amp;c.,<br>\
are they two; and &#39;Amr and his brother: [lit.,<br>\
separate, or distinct, are they two; &amp;c.: or remote<br>\
are they two, one from the other; &amp;c.:] or how<br>\
greatly, or widely, are they two separated; &amp;c.!<br>\
(S, A, K:) here ما is redundant; and in the<br>\
former phrase, هما is the agent of شتّان; as is the<br>\
former of the two nouns, to which the latter noun<br>\
is conjoined, in the latter phrase. (TA.) ElAashà says,<br>\
شَتَّانَ مَا يَوْمِى عَلَى كُورِهَا<br>\
وَيَوْمُ حَيَّانَ أَخِىجَابِرِ<br>\
[Different, or widely different, &amp;c., are (or were)<br>\
my day upon her (the camel&#39;s) saddle, and the day<br>\
of Heiyán the brother of Jábir: in which, for يَوْمِى<br>\
and يَوْمُ, some read نَوْمِى and نَوْمُ]. (S, TA.)<br>\
And in like manner, [but without ما,] one says,<br>\
شَتَّانَ أَخُوهُ وَأَبُوهُ [Different, or widely different,<br>\
&amp;c., are his brother and his father]. (TA.) [See<br>\
also an ex. in a verse cited voce دَائِمٌ, in art. دوم.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  شَتَّانَ, is a preterite verbal noun, signifying<br>\
اِفْتَرَقَ, [and so expl. above,] accord. to many<br>\
authorities, [including most of the grammarians,]<br>\
and therefore they have made it a condition that<br>\
its agent must be what denotes more than one:<br>\
[for اشترطوا فى فعله التردّد, I read اشترطوا فى<br>\
فاعلهُ التعدّد, which agrees with what is afterwards<br>\
said in the TA and here; though the former phrase<br>\
may be so rendered as to convey essentially the<br>\
same meaning: but this condition is not necessary<br>\
if we render شتّان by بَعُدَ:] (TA:) or it signifies<br>\
تَبَاعَدَ and اِفْتَرَقَ; (Ibn-Umm-Kásim;) or بَعُدَ;<br>\
[and so expl. above;] (S, A, Msb, K;) and is inflected from شَتُتَ; (S, K;) [which is a verb not<br>\
used; in the CK, incorrectly, شَتَتَ;] the fet-hah<br>\
of the ن being the fet-hah originally pertaining<br>\
to the [final] ت [of the verb]; and this fet-hah<br>\
shows the word to be inflected from the preterite<br>\
verb, like as سَرْعَانَ is from سَرُعَ, and وَشْكَانَ from<br>\
وَشُكَ: (S:) or, accord. to Er-Radee, it implies<br>\
wonder, [like several verbs of the measure فَعُلَ,<br>\
as shown in remarks on هَيُؤَ &amp;c.,] and means how<br>\
greatly separated, disunited, or severed, &amp;c.!<br>\
(TA:) or, accord. to El-Marzookee and Hr and<br>\
Zj and some others, it is an inf. n.: El-Marzookee<br>\
says, in his Expos. of the Fs, that it is an inf. n.<br>\
of a verb not used, [namely شَتُتَ,] and is indecl.,<br>\
with fet-hah for its termination, because it is put<br>\
in the place of a pret. verb, being equivalent to<br>\
شَتَّ, [for شَتُتَ,] i. e., تَشَتَّتَ أَوْ تَفَرَّقَ جِدًّا [as expl.<br>\
above]: and Zj says that it is an inf. n. occupying<br>\
the place of a verb, of the measure فَعْلَان, and<br>\
therefore indecl., because differing thus from<br>\
others of its class: Aboo-&#39;Othmán El-Mázinee<br>\
says that شَتَّان and سُبْحَان may receive tenween,<br>\
whether they be substs, or occupying the place of<br>\
substs.: upon which AAF observes that if شتّان<br>\
be in its proper place, it is a verbal noun, meaning شَتَّ: if with tenween, it is indeterminate; if<br>\
without tenween, determinate; and if translated<br>\
from its office of a verbal noun, and made a subst.<br>\
answering to التَّشْتِيتُ, and determinate, it is<br>\
similar to سبحان in the phrase سُبْحَانَ مِنْ عَلْقَمَةَ<br>\
الفَاخِرِ, which is a subst. answering to التَّنْزِيهُ.<br>\
(TA.) The ن in شَتَّان (sometimes, TA) receives<br>\
kesreh; (K;) though this is contr. to what is said<br>\
by AZ and by IDrst: its being sometimes with<br>\
kesreh is mentioned by Th, on the authority of<br>\
Fr: and Er-Radee seems to infer that its being<br>\
so was an opinion of As; and gives two reasons<br>\
for his disallowal of the expression شتّان ما بين;<br>\
first, because شتّان occurs with kesr to the ن; and<br>\
second, because its agent cannot be otherwise than<br>\
what denotes more than one: [but see what has<br>\
been observed above on this point:] IAmb says<br>\
that one must not say شَتَّانِ مَا بَيْنَ أَخِيكَ وَأَبِيكَ,<br>\
because, in this case, شتّان [virtually] governs<br>\
only one noun in the nom. case: but that one may<br>\
say, شَتَّانِ أَخُوكَ وَأَبُوكَ, and شَتَّانِ مَا أَخُوكَ وَأَبُوكَ,<br>\
using شَتَّانِ as the dual of شَتٌّ; though correctly<br>\
شتّان is a verbal noun: MF, however, observes<br>\
that the Expositors of the Fs seem to say that Fr<br>\
makes شَتَّانِ to be the dual of شَتٌّ; but that he<br>\
only mentions it as a dial. var. of شَتَّانَ: the following is adduced as an ex.<br>\
لَشَتَّانَ مَا أَنْوِى وَيَنْوِى بَنُو أَبِى<br>\
[Different, or widely different, &amp;c., are that<br>\
which I intend and that which the sons of my<br>\
father intend]: in which شتّان is read with both<br>\
fet-hah and kesreh: and it is said in the O that<br>\
شَتَّانِ is a dial. var. of شَتَّانَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  IJ mentions ↓ شَتَّى as an accidental syn. of شتّان; and<br>\
says that it is not the fem. of the latter: therefore<br>\
the assertion of some, that it is used by poetical<br>\
license in the following verse of Jemeel requires<br>\
consideration:<br>\
أُرِيدُ صِلَاحَهَا وَتُرِيدُ قَتْلِى<br>\
وَشَتَّى بَيْنَ قَتْلِى وَالصِّلَاحِ<br>\
[I desire to make peace with her, but she desires<br>\
to slay me: and different, or widely different,<br>\
&amp;c., are slaying me and making peace]. (TA.)<br>\
