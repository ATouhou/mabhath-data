manner like that which is termed نَضْحٌ [i. e.<br>\
sprinkling]; (TA;) عَلَى الشَّرَابِ [upon the wine,<br>\
or beverage]: (S, K:) سَنَّهُ signifies “ he poured<br>\
it gently. ” (TA.) And شَنَّتِ العَيْنُ دَمْعَهَا The eye<br>\
poured forth its tears; (TA;) or sent forth [or<br>\
shed] its tears; like شَلَّت, (Lh, TA in art. شل,)<br>\

substitution [of ل for ن]. (TA in that art.) ―<br>\

-b3-<br>\
And شَنَّ بِسَلْحِهِ (AA, S, * TA) He cast forth his<br>\
excrement, or dung, in a thin [and scattered]<br>\

تَشَنَّنَتِ القِرْبَةُ, and ↓ تشانّت, (S, K,) and<br>\
↓ اشنّت and ↓ استشنّت, (K,) The water-skin became old, and worn out: (S, K:) or ↓ تشانّ,<br>\
said of skin, or a skin, does not signify thus, but<br>\
signifies, (AA, S,) or signifies also, (K,) and so<br>\
تشنّن, (S, K, TA,) said of the skin of a man, in extreme old age, (S,) it contracted, shrank, shrivelled,<br>\
or wrinkled; or became contracted or shrunk<br>\
&amp;c.; (S, K, TA;) and dried up: (S, TA:) and<br>\
↓ استشنّ is likewise said of the skin of a man,<br>\
meaning it became old, and worn out, like the old,<br>\
and worn-out, شَنّ. (Har p. 675.) It is said in<br>\

wolf made an incursion among the sheep or goats;<br>\

(Kh, S, K,) said of a man, (Kh, S, TA,) and of a<br>\
camel, (TA,) (tropical:)  He became lean, or emaciated,<br>\
(Kh, S, K, TA,) like the water-skin that has<br>\
become old, and worn out: so says Aboo-Kheyreh:<br>\
(TA:) or, said of an animal, he became dried up,<br>\
and lean, or emaciated. (Har p. 530.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
استشنّ إِلَى اللَّبَنِ i. q. عَامَ, (K,) i. e. He betook<br>\

شَنْشَنَةٌ [an inf. n., of which the verb,<br>\
if it be used, is شَنْشَنَ,] The motion of paper, and<br>\
of a new garment: [or rather the making a kind<br>\
of crackling sound by the motion thereof:] mentioned by Az in art. فقع: (TA:) and نَشْنَشَةٌ signifies the same: both thus expl. by IAar. (TA<br>\
in art. قع.)<br>\
شَنٌّ A skin, (Msb,) or a water-skin, (S,<br>\
Mgh,) or a small water skin, (K,) or, as some<br>\
say, any vessel made of skin, (TA,) applied<br>\
by a poet to a دَلْو [or leathern bucket], (Ham<br>\
p. 602,) that is old, and worn out; (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K, TA;) and so ↓ شَنَّةٌ; (S, K;) but app.<br>\
one that is small: (S: [in which this addition<br>\
to the explanation seems to relate peculiarly to<br>\
the latter word: see an ex. of this latter word in<br>\
some verses cited in the first paragraph of art.<br>\
سقى:]) or both signify an old water-skin; as<br>\
also ↓ مِشَنٌّ: (MA:) and ↓ شَنَنٌ, also, signifies<br>\
an old, worn-out, water-skin: (TA:) pl. (of the<br>\
first, Mgh, Msb) شِنَانٌ: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) and<br>\
Lh mentions the phrase قِرْبَةٌ أَشْنَانٌ, as though<br>\
they applied the term شَنٌّ to every portion of the<br>\
قربة and then pluralized it thus; but he says that<br>\
he had not heard أَشْنَانٌ as a pl. of شَنٌّ except in<br>\
this case: (TA:) the water in a شَنّ is cooler<br>\
[than that in a skin not so old]. (Mgh.) It is<br>\
said in a prov., لَا يُقَعْقَعُ لِى بِالشِّنَانِ [A confused<br>\
and clattering noise will not be made to me with<br>\
the old and worn-out water-skins to frighten me]:<br>\
(S in the present art.: [in the S and K in art.<br>\
قع, with مَا in the place of لا; and in the K in<br>\
that art., with لَهُ in the place of لى:]) مَا يُقَعْقَعُ لَهُ<br>\
بِالشِّنَانِ is applied to him who will not be abased<br>\
by misfortunes, nor frightened by that which has<br>\
no reality: (Sgh and K in art. قع:) or it means,<br>\
he will not be deceived nor frightened: شِنَان<br>\
being pl. of شَنٌّ, a dried up skin, which is shaken<br>\
to a camel to frighten him. (L and TA in art.<br>\
قع.) An old man is likened to the skin thus<br>\
termed. (Har p. 675.) And ↓ شَنَّةٌ signifies also<br>\
(tropical:)  A worn-out old woman; as being likened to the<br>\
skin thus termed. (IAar, TA.) And one says,<br>\
رَفَعَ فُلَانٌ الشَّنَّ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a man raised<br>\
himself bearing upon the palm of his hand. (IKh,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q. غرض [app. غَرَضٌ, i. e. A butt,<br>\
at which one shoots or casts: probably because<br>\
an old water-skin was sometimes used as a butt]:<br>\
pl. as above. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And, as Freytag states,<br>\
on the authority of Meyd, (assumed tropical:)  Dry herbage.]<br>\

K,) signifying Hatred; [or the hating of another;]<br>\
(S;) mentioned by AO. (S in art. شنأ.)<br>\
شُنَانٌ Water in a scattered state, or being scattered. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (K) Cold water: (As,<br>\
Skr, ISd, K:) this explanation is preferred by<br>\
Aboo-Nasr. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Clouds (سَحَاب) pouring (يَشُنُّ i. e. يَصُبُّ) water. (Skr, TA.)<br>\
شَنُونٌ A camel in a state between that of the<br>\
lean, or emaciated, and that of the fat; (S;) so<br>\
called because some of his fatness has gone:<br>\
(Aboo-Kheyreh, TA:) one says مَهْزُولٌ; then<br>\
مُنْقٍ, when he has become a little fat; then شَنُونٌ;<br>\
then سَاحٌّ; and then مُثَرْطِمٌ, when fat in the utmost<br>\
degree: (Lh, TA:) so says Aboo-Ma&#39;add El-Kilá-<br>\
bee. (TA in art. سح.) [But it is said that] it signifies<br>\
also Lean, or emaciated; (K;) applied to a beast:<br>\
(TA:) and fat: thus having two contr. meanings. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Hungry: (S, K:) applied<br>\
in this sense by Et-Tirimmáh to a wolf, because<br>\
this animal is not described as fat or lean. (S.)<br>\
شَنِينٌ Poured forth: applied in this sense by<br>\
the Hudhalee poet &#39;Abd-Menáf to thick blood<br>\
(عَلَق). (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Pure milk upon which<br>\

milk, whether fresh or collected in a skin at<br>\
different times, upon which water is poured.<br>\

from a tree. (S.)<br>\
شَانَّةٌ The [channel called] مَدْفَع [q. v.] of a<br>\
small valley: or a small مَدْفَع of a valley: (TA:<br>\
[the want of a vowel-sign in my original renders<br>\
it doubtful which of these meanings is the right<br>\
one:]) or شَوَانُّ, its pl., signifies the channels of<br>\
water, of mountains, that pour forth into valleys<br>\
from a rugged place. (AA, TA.)<br>\
شِنْشِنَةٌ A nature; or a natural, a native, or an<br>\
innate, disposition or temper or the like; syn.<br>\
طَبِيعَةٌ, (S, Mgh, K,) and خُلُقٌ, (S,) and سَجِيَّةٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and a custom, habit, or wont: (Mgh, K:)<br>\
[pl. شَنَاشِنُ.] One says فِيهِ مِنْ أَبِيهِ شَنَاشِنُ In him<br>\
are habits [or natural dispositions inherited]<br>\
from his father. (TA.) Hence,<br>\
شِنْشِنَةٌ أَعْرِفُهَا مِنْ أَخْزَمْ<br>\
[A natural disposition, or a habit, which I know,<br>\
as inherited from Akhzam]: (S, Meyd, Mgh:)<br>\
or, accord. to one relation, نِشْنِشَةٌ, which is app.<br>\
formed by transposition from شِنْشِنَةٌ: (Meyd:)<br>\
a prov.: (Meyd, Mgh:) [of its origin there are<br>\
different explanations: see Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov.<br>\
i. 658, and Har pp. 591 and 596:] أَخْزَمُ is the<br>\
proper name of a man: (Meyd, Mgh, &amp;c.:) or<br>\
accord. to Lth, it is an epithet applied to a penis;<br>\
one says كَمَرَةٌ خَزْمَآءُ “ a glans of a penis having a<br>\
short frænum,” and ذَكَرٌ أَخْزَمُ; and شنشنة means<br>\
the dropping of water [i. e., in this case, of the<br>\
seminal fluid]: (Meyd:) the prov. is applied in<br>\
relation to nearness of resemblance. (Meyd,<br>\
Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A bit of flesh-meat, as much as is<br>\
chewed at once; syn. مُضْغَةٌ: or a piece of flesh-meat; (K, TA;) and so نِشْنِشَةٌ: on the authority<br>\
of AA. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [the pl.] شَنَاشِنُ signifies<br>\
