شَحَطَ, aor.<br>\
شَحَطَ, inf. n. شَحْطٌ (S, K) and شَحَطٌ<br>\
(K) and شُحُوطٌ (S, K) and مَشْحَطٌ; (K;) and<br>\
شَحِطَ, aor.<br>\
شَحَطَ, (K,) inf. n. شَحَطٌ; (TA;) It was,<br>\
or became, distant, or remote: (S, K:) or شَحْطٌ<br>\
and شَحَطٌ signify the being distant, or remote, in<br>\
all states or circumstances. (TA.) You say,<br>\
شَحَطَ المَزَارُ The place of visiting was, or became,<br>\
distant, or remote. (S.) And لَا أَنْسَاكَ عَلَى شَحْطِ<br>\
الدَّارِ I will not forget thee notwithstanding the<br>\
distance of the dwelling. (TA.) And El-&#39;Ajjáj<br>\
says,<br>\
وَالشَّحْطُ قَطَّاعُ رَجَآءِ مَنْ رَجَا<br>\
[And distance is the severer of the hope of him<br>\
who hopeth]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شَحَطَ فِى السَّوْمِ He went<br>\
far, or far from what was right, and exceeded<br>\
the due limit, in the demanding of a price. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Hence, (TA,) شَحَطَ البَعِيرَ فِى السَّوْمِ, (K,<br>\
TA, [in the CK, and in a MS. copy of the K,<br>\
البّعِيرُ,]) aor.<br>\
شَحَطَ, inf. n. شَحْطٌ, (TA,) He went to<br>\
the utmost of the value of the camel in the demanding of a price: (K, TA:) or he went far from<br>\
what was right, and exceeded the due limit:<br>\
(K:) and شَحِطَ signifies the same; (K;) or is<br>\
thought to do so by ISd. (TA.) Hence, also, what<br>\
is said in a trad., by Rabee&#39;ah, respecting a man<br>\
emancipating a portion of a slave: يَكُونُ عَلَى<br>\
المُعْتِقِ قِيمَةُ أَنْصِبَآءِ شُرَكَآئِهِ يُشْحَطُ الثَّمَنُ ثُمَّ يُعْتِقُ<br>\
كُلَّهُ [The value of the portions of his copartners<br>\
shall be imposed upon the emancipater;] the<br>\
price of the slave shall be carried to the utmost;<br>\
[then he shall emancipate the whole of him:] or<br>\
the meaning is, the price of the slave shall be<br>\
collected; from شَحَطَ الإِنَآءَ, which see below.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  شَحَطَ فُلَانًا He preceded, outwent, got<br>\
before, or passed beyond, such a one, and became<br>\
far from him: (K, TA:) and in like manner,<br>\
الخَيْلَ [the horses, or horsemen]. (T, TA.) One<br>\
says also, شَحَطَتْ بَنُو هَاشِمٍ العَرَبَ The sons of<br>\
Háshim surpassed, and outstripped, the Arabs<br>\
[in general] in excellence. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شَحَطَ الإِنَآءَ<br>\
He filled the vessel. (Fr, K.)<br>\
-A3-  See also 5.<br>\

شحّطهُ, inf. n. تَشْحِيطٌ, (S, K,) He made<br>\
him (a slain man) to struggle, or flounder, بِدَمِهِ<br>\
in his blood: (S:) or he besmeared, bedawbed,<br>\
befouled, or defiled, him, بِالدَّمِ with blood. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اشحطهُ He made him, or caused him, to be,<br>\
or become, distant, or remote; he put him, sent<br>\
him, or removed him, far away. (S, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تشحّط He (a slain man) struggled, or<br>\
floundered, بِدَمِهِ in his blood: (S:) and ↓ شَحْطٌ<br>\
[inf. n. of شَحَطَ] also signifies the struggling, or<br>\
floundering, in blood: (Lth, ISd, K:) or the<br>\
former signifies he struggled, or floundered, and<br>\
rolled, or wallowed, فِى دَمِهِ in his blood: (TA:)<br>\
or became besmeared, bedawbed, befouled, or defiled, (Mgh, K,) and he rolled, or wallowed,<br>\
(Mgh,) or struggled, or floundered, (K,) فِى دَمِهِ<br>\
in his blood. (Mgh, K. *) And It (the fœtus)<br>\
struggled, or floundered, فِى السَّلَى in the membrane enclosing it. (K.)<br>\
شَحَّاطٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
مَنْزِلٌ شَاحِطٌ A distant, or remote, place of<br>\
abode; as also ↓ شَحَّاطٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شَوَاحِطُ الأَوْدِيَةِ,<br>\
[the former word being pl. of شَاحِطَةٌ,] The distant, or remote, parts of the valleys. (TA.)<br>\
شَوْحَطٌ Certain trees, (K,) a species of the trees<br>\
of the mountains, (S,) meaning of the mountains<br>\
of the سَرَاة, [the mountain-range extending from<br>\
near &#39;Arafát to Nejrán in El-Yemen,] for there<br>\
they grow, (TA,) of which bows are made: (S,<br>\
K:) AHn says, One acquainted with [the kind<br>\
of trees called] the شوحط has informed me that<br>\
it grows in the manner of the أَرْز [or pine-tree],<br>\
many rods growing from one stem; its leaves<br>\
are thin and long, and it has a fruit like the long<br>\
grape, [the word here rendered “ grape ” is عنبة,<br>\
but it has been altered in the MS., and may<br>\
therefore be incorrect,] except that its extremity<br>\
is more slender, and it is soft, and is eaten:<br>\
(TA:) or i. q.  نَبْعٌ: (IB:) or a species of the<br>\
نَبْع, (K,) of which bows are made: (TA:) or<br>\
the شوحط and نبع and شِرْيَان are one; the name<br>\
varying according to the excellence of their places of<br>\
growth; what is upon the summit of the mountain<br>\
being called نبع; what is upon its base, or foot,<br>\
or lowest or lower part, شريان; and what is in<br>\
the depressed tract by its base, شوحط: (Mbr,<br>\
Az, K:) IB says the same with respect to the<br>\
نبع, but that the شوحط is that which is upon the<br>\
lowest part of the mountain; and this is confirmed<br>\
by what is said by AZ and others: El-Ghanawee<br>\
El-Aarábee says, the نبع and شوحط and سَرَآء are<br>\
one: as to the شريان, no one holds it to be of the<br>\
نبع except Mbr: Aboo-Ziyád says that bows are<br>\
made of the شريان, and they are good, but of a<br>\
black colour tinged with redness: and AHn says<br>\
in one place, that the نبع and شوحط are yellow<br>\
in the wood, heavy in the hand; and when they<br>\
become old, they become red: (TA:) the n. un. is<br>\
with ة. (K.)<br>\
