شَنِئَهُ, (Th, S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) and شَنَأَهُ,<br>\
(K,) but this is said by AHeyth to be a bad dial.<br>\
var. of the former, (TA,) aor.<br>\
شَنَاَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
شَنْءٌ (AO, S, Msb, K) and شِنْءٌ and شُنْءٌ (Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee, S, K) and شَنْأَةٌ (K, TA, in<br>\
the CK شَناءَة [i. e. شَنَآءَةٌ, which is afterwards added<br>\
in the TA, not as in the K, and mentioned in the<br>\
S but not there said to be an inf. n.,]) and شَنَأٌ<br>\
(TA from Es-Safákusee) and شَنَآءٌ (TA [as from J,<br>\
but perhaps from Az, for I do not find it in the<br>\
S,]) and مَشْنَأٌ (S, CK, and TA as from Es-Safá-<br>\
kusee, not as from the K,) and مَشْنَأَةٌ and مَشْنُؤَةٌ<br>\
(K, TA, the last in the CK مَشْنُوءَة [i. e. مَشْنُوْءَةٌ],)<br>\
and مَشْنِئَةٌ (TA from Es-Safákusee) and شَنَآنٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) which is anomalous as being of a measure<br>\
regularly employed [only] for the inf. n. of a verb<br>\
signifying motion and agitation, as ضَرَبَانٌ and<br>\
خَفَقَانٌ, (S, TA,) for though it has been said that<br>\
[hatred (which it signifies) is attended by anger<br>\
and] anger is accompanied by agitation of the<br>\
heart, there is no necessary connection between<br>\
hatred and anger, and it is anomalous also as being<br>\
of a measure not proper to [the inf. n. of] a<br>\
trans. verb, (TA,) and شَنْآنٌ, (S, Msb, K,) which<br>\
is also anomalous, and [said to be] the only<br>\
instance of its kind (S, TA) except لَيَّانٌ, though<br>\
some few others have been mentioned, as زَيْدَانٌ,<br>\
but this is not well known, [and خَشْيَانٌ, of which<br>\
the same may be said,] and وَشْكَانٌ [perhaps a<br>\
simple subst.], and جَوْلَانٌ which is said to occur<br>\
in a verse [perhaps contracted from جَوَلَان by<br>\
poetic license], (TA,) and AO mentions شَنَانٌ,<br>\
without ء, as being like شَنْآنٌ; (S;) these inf. ns.<br>\
being fourteen, which is said by IKtt to be the<br>\
greatest number of inf. ns. to any one verb, only<br>\
seven other verbs, he says, having this number,<br>\
namely, قَدَرَ, لَقِىَ, وَرَدَ, هَلَكَ, تَمَّ, مَكَثَ and غَلَبَ;<br>\
but Es-Safákusee makes the inf. ns. of شَنِئَ to be<br>\
fifteen, [though the fifteenth form (which is perhaps مَشْنُوْءَةٌ) I do not find mentioned,] and this<br>\
is the greatest number known; (TA;) He hated<br>\
him: (IKoot, IF, S, ISd, IKtt, Mgh, Msb, K,<br>\
&amp;c.:) or, as some say, he hated him vehemently.<br>\
(TA.) يشنى, [app. يُشْنَى, for يُشْنَأُ,] with the<br>\
hemzeh changed into ى, occurs in a trad. (TA.)<br>\
And شُنِئَ signifies He (a man, S) was hated, (S,<br>\
and so accord. to some copies of the K,) or was<br>\
rendered hateful, or an object of hatred, (so<br>\
accord. to other copies of the K,) even if beautiful<br>\
or comely. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  شَنِئَ لَهُ حَقَّهُ, (K,) so says<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd, or, accord. to Th, شَنَأَ إِلَيْهِ, like مَنَعَ [in<br>\
form], and this is the more correct, aor. of each<br>\
شَنَاَ,<br>\
(TA,) He gave him his right, or due. (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
Th, K, TA.) And شَنِئَ بِهِ He acknowledged it:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) or he gave him (K) his right, or<br>\
due, (TA,) [or the meaning in the K may be he<br>\
gave it,] and declared himself clear, or quit, of<br>\
him or it; as also شَنَأَ: (K:) [but accord. to SM,<br>\
this is wrong, for he says that] the author of the<br>\
K should have said, or شَنِئَ إِلَيْهِ, like شَنَأَ, aor.<br>\
شَنَاَ,<br>\
he gave him, and declared himself clear, or quit,<br>\
of him or it. (TA.) And شَنِئَ الشَّىْءَ He produced<br>\
the thing: (K, TA:) or, as A&#39;Obeyd says, شَنِئَ حَقَّهُ<br>\
he acknowledged his right, or due, and produced<br>\
it from his possession. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَشَانَؤُوا They hated one another. (S, O, K.)<br>\
شَنْءٌ and شِنْءٌ and شُنْءٌ [all mentioned above as<br>\
inf. ns., when used as simple substs. signify<br>\
Hatred; and thus ↓ شَنَآءَةٌ, likewise mentioned<br>\
above as an inf. n., signifies accord. to the S;<br>\
and so ↓ شَنِيْئَةٌ accord. to Freytag, as on the<br>\
authority of Meyd; and app. also شَنُوْءَةٌ, q. v.; or<br>\
all signify] vehement hatred; in which sense the<br>\
first is expl. by AO: (TA:) or ↓ شَنَآءَةٌ signifies<br>\
hatred mixed with enmity and evilness of disposition. (Ham p. 108)<br>\
شَنُؤَةٌ: see شَنُوْءَةٌ, in three places.<br>\
شَنَآءَةٌ: see شَنْءٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also, and<br>\
↓ شَنَائِيَةٌ, epithets applied to a man, Rendered hateful, or an object of hatred, evil in disposition. (Lth,<br>\
O, TA.) [See also the latter word voce شَنْآن;<br>\
and see مَشْنُوْءٌ, and مِشْنَآءٌ.]<br>\
شَنُوْءَةٌ The removing oneself far, or keeping<br>\
aloof, from unclean things; (S, K, TA;) and the<br>\
continual doing so, or the continual purification<br>\
of oneself; as also ↓ شَنُؤَةٌ; and accord. to the K,<br>\
شُنُوْءَةٌ, but this is not found elsewhere. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, (S,) أَزْدُ شَنُوْءَةَ, the appellation of a tribe of<br>\
El-Yemen; (S, K; *) sometimes called أَزْدُ شَنُوَّةَ:<br>\
(ISk, S, K:) [or] this tribe was so called because<br>\
of شَنْآن among them; (K, TA;) i. e. because of<br>\
mutual hatred that occurred among them: (TA:)<br>\
[whence it seems that شَنُوْءَةٌ signifies also Hatred:]<br>\
or because of their removing far from their<br>\
[original] district: or, accord. to El-Khafájee,<br>\
because of their high lineage, and good deeds;<br>\
from the phrase رَجُلُ شَنُوْدَةٍ, meaning A man of<br>\
pure lineage and of manly virtue; and AO says<br>\
the like. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And accord. to Reiske, as<br>\
stated by Freytag, (who has written it ↓ شَنُؤَةٌ in<br>\
all its senses,) it is expl. by Meyd as meaning<br>\
What is esteemed sordid, of words and of actions.]<br>\
-A2-  Also One who removes himself far, or keeps<br>\
aloof, from unclean things; (K, TA;) and so<br>\
↓ شَنُؤَةٌ. (TA.) Thus both of these words are<br>\
epithets, as well as substs. (TA.)<br>\
شَنِيْئَةٌ: see شَنْءٌ.<br>\
شَنْآن, of which the fem. is شَنْآنَةٌ and شَنْأَى, [so<br>\
that one may say either شَنْآنٌ or شَنْآنُ,] is an<br>\
epithet applied to a man; (K;) [signifying either<br>\
Hating or (like مَشْنُوْءٌ) hated; the former meaning seeming to be indicated by what immediately<br>\
precedes it in the K; but the latter appears from<br>\
what here follows to be the right meaning, and<br>\
perhaps it may be that which is meant in the K;]<br>\
as also ↓ شَنَانِئَةٌ or ↓ شَنَائِيَةٌ [q. v. voce شَنَآءَةٌ]:<br>\
so accord. to different copies of the K. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
In the Kur v. 3 and 11, it is accord. to some an<br>\
inf. n., and some read there شَنَآن: [see 1, first<br>\
sentence:] accord. to others, it is an epithet, signifying مُبْغَضٌ or بَغِيضٌ [i. e. Hated or odious].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  شَنْآنُ الشِّتَآءِ, in a trad. of Kaab, is said<br>\
to be a metaphorical expression for بَرْدُ الشِّتَآءِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [The cold of winter]; because it is hated: or, as<br>\
some say, by the بَرْد thereof is meant ease and<br>\
repose: and the meaning intended is either<br>\
mutual hatred or ease and repose. (TA.)<br>\
شَنَائِيَةٌ: see شَنَآءَةٌ, and شَنْآن.<br>\
شَنَانِئَةٌ: see شَنْآن.<br>\
شَانِئٌ Hating, or a hater, (Fr, S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA,) and an enemy: (Fr, TA:) fem. with ة.<br>\
(Mgh, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  لَا أَبَا لِشَانِئِكَ, as also لَا أَبَ لِشَانِئِكَ,<br>\
(S, O, [but in my two copies of the S لِشَانِيكَ,<br>\
which perhaps expresses the general pronunciation, and in the TA لا ابا لشانئك and لا ابا لشانيك,])<br>\
means لِمُبْغِضِكَ [i. e., lit., May there be no father<br>\
to thy hater]; and is said by ISk to be a metonymical expression for لَا أَبَا لَكَ [q. v., lit. an imprecation, but generally meant as an expression of<br>\
praise]. (S, O, TA.)<br>\
شَوَانِئُ المَالِ means [Camels, or the like,] not<br>\
avariciously retained; as though hated, and therefore liberally given away: (IAar, K, TA:) شوانئ<br>\
being app. an act. part. n. [in the pl.] used in the<br>\
sense of a pass. part. n., like the instances in<br>\
مَآءٌ دَافِقٌ and عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ. (MF, TA.)<br>\
مَشْنَأٌ, applied to a man, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, O,) like<br>\
مَشْنَعٌ [in form, and perhaps in meaning],<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, TA,) Foul, or ugly, in aspect; as also<br>\
↓ مِشْنَآءٌ: (S, O:) or foul, or ugly, (K, TA,) in<br>\
face, (TA,) even if made an object of love [by<br>\
good qualities]: (K, TA:) [originally an inf. n.,<br>\
and therefore] used alike as sing. (S, O, K) and<br>\
dual (S, O) and pl. (S, O, K) and masc. and<br>\
fem.: (K:) so says Lth: (TA:) or one who hates<br>\
men; (K;) and so ↓ مِشْنَآءٌ, accord. to &#39;Alee Ibn-<br>\
Hamzeh El-Isbahánee: (TA:) or ↓ this last signifies one whom men hate: or it may be well<br>\
rendered one who does much for which he is to be<br>\
hated; for it is one of the measures of the act.<br>\
part. n. [used in an intensive sense]. (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
K.)<br>\
مِشْنَآءٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
مَشْنُوْءٌ, applied to a man, (S,) Hated, (S, and<br>\
so in some copies of the K, [see also شَنْآن,]) or<br>\
rendered hateful, or an object of hatred, (so<br>\
accord. to other copies of the K,) even if beautiful, or comely; (S, K;) and مَشْنُوٌّ and مَشْنِىٌّ<br>\
signify the same. (K in art. شنو.)<br>\
مَشْنِيْئَةٌ, occurring in a trad. of &#39;Áïsheh, [A kind<br>\
of food that is supped, or sipped;] i. q. حَسَآءٌ and<br>\
تَلْبِينَةٌ: [see these two words:] said by IAth to be<br>\
irregularly formed from مَشْنُوْءَةٌ, by changing the<br>\
ء into ى [so that the word becomes مَشْنُويَةٌ, and<br>\
then, by rule, مَشْنِيَّةٌ, which is mentioned in the<br>\
TA, in art. شنو, as occurring thus in a trad.,] and<br>\
then by restoring the ء [in the place of the second<br>\
ى], the meaning being hated. (TA.)<br>\
