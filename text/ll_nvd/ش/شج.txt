شَجَّهُ, aor.<br>\
شَجُ3َ and<br>\
شَجِ3َ, (S, Msb, K,) the former<br>\
reg., (Msb,) [the latter irreg.,] inf. n. شَجٌّ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) He broke it, [so as to cleave its skin or its<br>\
flesh,] namely, another&#39;s head: (S, * K, TA:) or<br>\
he clave his skin of the face or of the head; or<br>\
he clave its skin, i. e. the skin of the face or of the<br>\
head: (Msb:) originally he struck it, namely,<br>\
the head, so as to wound it and cleave it [in the<br>\
skin or flesh thereof]; and then used in relation<br>\
to other members: (TA:) or شَجَّهُ فِى رَأْسِهِ and<br>\
فِى وَجْهِهِ [he wounded him so as to cleave the<br>\
skin or the flesh in his head and in his face]. (A.)<br>\
Accord. to some, [contr. to the authority of the<br>\
A,] it is from شَجَّتِ السَّفِينَةُ البّحْرَ [expl. below].<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] it is said in a prov., فُلَانٌ<br>\
يَشُجُّ بِيَدٍ وَيَأْسُو بِأُخْرَى [Such a one breaks a head<br>\
with one hand and cures with another]; meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  such a one corrupts, or mars, one time, and<br>\
rectifies, or repairs, another time. (TA.) And<br>\
زَيْدٌ يَشُجُّ مَرَّةً وَيَأْسُو مَرَّةً (tropical:)  Zeyd does, or says,<br>\
wrong one time, and right one time. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And شَجَّتِ السَّفِينَةُ البَحْرَ (tropical:)  The ship clave the sea:<br>\
(S, A, L, Msb:) and [in like manner] شَجَّ البَحْرَ<br>\
(tropical:)  he clave the sea; (K, TA;) said of a swimmer.<br>\
(TA.) And شَجَّ المَفَازَةَ (tropical:)  He traversed the desert.<br>\
(S, A, K.) And شَجَّ الأَرْضَ بِرَاحِلَتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He traversed the land, with his camel that he rode, at a<br>\
vehement rate. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And شَجَّ الشَّرَابَ, (K,<br>\
TA,) or شَجَّ الخَمْرَ بِالمَآء, aor.<br>\
شَجُ3َ and<br>\
شَجِ3َ, inf. n.<br>\
شَجٌّ, [as above,] (TA,) (tropical:)  He mixed the beverage,<br>\
or the wine, (K, TA,) with water. (TA.) Hence,<br>\
فَكَانَ يَشُِجُّ عَلَىَّ مِسْكًا, occurring in a trad., means<br>\
(tropical:)  And it was as though it mixed with her odour<br>\
of musk the breath of wind that reached my<br>\
organ of smell. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
تَشْجِيجٌ [The breaking of another&#39;s head<br>\
much, so as to cleave the skin or the flesh: or the<br>\
breaking of heads so as to cleave the skin or the<br>\
flesh. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, perhaps,] (assumed tropical:)  The acting with<br>\
penetrative energy, vigour, or effectiveness; syn.<br>\
تَصْمِيمٌ. (O, K.)<br>\
3<br>\
بَيْنَهُمْ شِجَاجٌ (A, O, K) and ↓ تَشَاجٌّ (A, TA)<br>\
Between them is a mutual breaking of heads.<br>\
(A, O, K, TA. [In the CK, شَجَاجٌ is erroneously<br>\
put for شِجَاجٌ.])<br>\
6<br>\
تَشَاْجَ3َ see what next precedes.<br>\
شَجَّةٌ A single act of breaking of one&#39;s head [so<br>\
as to cleave its skin or its flesh]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
A wound by which the head is broken (S, * A, * L,<br>\
Msb) so as to cleave its skin or its flesh: (L:)<br>\
and [such] a wound in the face: (A, * Msb:) pl.<br>\
شِجَاجٌ (S, A, L, Msb) and شَجَّاتٌ. (Msb.) What<br>\
are termed شِجَاج are of ten different kinds, (A,<br>\
L,) distinguished by the following epithets: [1]<br>\
حَارِصَةٌ, which peels off the [external] skin, but<br>\
does not bring blood: [2] دَامِيَةٌ, which brings<br>\
blood: [3] بَاضِعَةٌ, [which cleaves the flesh slightly,<br>\
and brings blood, but does not make it to flow:<br>\
(but in art. دمغ, voce دَامِغَةٌ, q. v., what are here<br>\
mentioned as the second and third are transposed:)<br>\
4, مُتَلَاحِمَةٌ,] which cleaves the flesh much: [5]<br>\
سِمْحَاقٌ, which leaves between it and the bone<br>\
only a thin skin: these are five شجاج for which<br>\
there is no retaliation nor any determinate mulct,<br>\
but respecting which a judge must give his sentence: [6] مُوضِحَةٌ, which reaches to the bone,<br>\
and for which the mulct is five camels: [7] هَاشِمَةٌ,<br>\
which breaks the bone, and for which the mulct<br>\
is ten camels: [8] مُنَقِّلَةٌ, from which bone is removed, from one place to another, and for which<br>\
the mulct is fifteen camels: [9] مَأْمُومَةٌ, also<br>\
called آمَّةٌ, which leaves between it and the brain<br>\
only a thin skin, and for which the mulct is one<br>\
third of the whole price of blood: [10] دَامِغَةٌ,<br>\
which reaches the brain, and for which the mulct<br>\
is also one third of the whole price of blood. (L.)<br>\
The شَجَّة of &#39;Abd-El-Hameed, [who was the<br>\
goodliest man of his age,] the son of &#39;Abd-Allah<br>\
the son of &#39;Omar the son of El-Khattáb, was the<br>\
subject of a prov. on account of its beauty [and is<br>\
said to have increased his goodliness]. (MF.)<br>\
شَجَجٌ The mark, or scar, of a wound by which<br>\
the forehead has been broken. (S, * A, K, * TA.)<br>\
شَجَجَى The عَقْعَق [or magpie]; (K, TA;<br>\
omitted in the CK;) [and] so ↓ شَجَوْجًى. (K<br>\
and TA in art. شجو.)<br>\
شَجِيجٌ and ↓ مَشْجُوجٌ A head broken [so that<br>\
its skin or its flesh is cloven]: or a man having<br>\
his head [so] broken: (S, TA:) pl. [of the former]<br>\
شَجَّى: you say قَوْمٌ شَجَّى. (AZ, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Each<br>\
is also applied as an epithet to a wooden peg or<br>\
stake [as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Having its head broken, or<br>\
mangled, by blows]: and so is ↓ مُشَجَّجٌ, but in an<br>\
intensive sense. (S, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And both the first and<br>\
↓ last signify (tropical:)  A wooden peg or stake; (A, TA;)<br>\
each as an epithet in which the quality of a subst.<br>\
predominates: because its head is separated, or<br>\
uncompacted, in its component parts [or fibres by<br>\
its being battered]. (TA.) One says, مَا بِالدَّارِ<br>\
شَجِيجٌ and ↓ مُشَجَّجٌ (tropical:)  There is not in the house<br>\
[even] a wooden peg or stake. (A, TA.)<br>\
شَجَوْجًى: see شَجَجَى.<br>\
سَابِحٌ شَجَّاجٌ (tropical:)  A swimmer that cleaves the<br>\
water vehemently. (TA.)<br>\
أَشَجُّ A man having a mark, or scar, of a wound<br>\
by which his forehead has been broken. (S, A, K.)<br>\
مُشَجَّجٌ: see شَجِيجٌ, in three places.<br>\
مَشْجُوجٌ: see شَجِيجٌ.<br>\
