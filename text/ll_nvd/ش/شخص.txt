فَكَانَ مِجَنِّى دُونَ مَنْ كُنْتُ أَتَّقِى<br>\

breasts were beginning to swell and one who had<br>\
attained the age of puberty, were my shield<br>\
against such as I was fearing]: meaning ثَلَاثَةُ<br>\
أَنْفُسٍ: (L:) [the poet making the word in question<br>\
fem. because it relates here to females: but] Rubeh is related to have said ثَلَاثَةُ أَشْخُصٍ, meaning,<br>\
of women. (M, voce نَفْسٌ.) A شَخْص [meaning<br>\
a person] ceases to be a شخص by its being<br>\
divided; whereas, when a جِسْم is divided, no part<br>\
of it ceases to be a جسم. (Er-Rághib, TA in art.<br>\
جسم.) It is said in a trad., لَا شَخْصَ أَغْيَرُ مِنَ اللّٰهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [There is not any being more jealous than<br>\
God]; شخص being here metaphorically used for<br>\
ذَات: or the meaning is, a person (شخص) should<br>\
not be more jealous than God: but accord. to one<br>\
relation, the words are لَا شَىْءَ أَغْيَرُ مِنَ اللّٰهِ [which<br>\
has the first of the two meanings mentioned<br>\
above]. (IAth, TA.) [It is also used in a pl.<br>\
sense: see a verse of Ziyád el-Aajam in art. الى.]<br>\
شَخِيصٌ Big, bulky, or corpulent: (S, K, TA:)<br>\

chief, man of rank or quality, or a personage.<br>\
(AZ, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  مَنْطِقٌ شَخِيصٌ (tropical:)  Sour, crabbed, or<br>\
austere, speech. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, A, K. [See also<br>\

greatness of شَخْص [or person] and make. (TA.)<br>\
[Said to be a subst.: but see شَخُصَ.]<br>\
شَاخِصٌ [part. n. of the intrans. verb شَخَصَ].<br>\

heard of thy coming, and my heart is throbbing<br>\
between my two sides, and my eye beneath my<br>\
bone of the eyebrow fixedly open, &amp;c.]. (A, TA.)<br>\
With the pl., أَبْصَارٌ, you say شَاخِصَةٌ, (A, Msb,<br>\
TA,) and شَوَاخِصُ, (A, TA,) or شُخُوصٌ [like<br>\
شُهُودٌ as pl. of شَاهِدٌ; if not an inf. n., as which it<br>\
may be applied, in the place of an epithet, to a<br>\
pl. subst.]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سَهْمٌ شَاخِصٌ (tropical:)  An arrow<br>\
passing beyond the butt, or object of aim, going<br>\
above it. (S, A.) You say, رُمِىَ بِالشَّاخِصَاتِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [He was shot at with arrows which passed<br>\
beyond him, going above him: perhaps doubly<br>\
tropical, meaning he was assailed with invectives<br>\
which did not harm him]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  شَاخِصٌ also<br>\
signifies A man prosecuting war [during three or<br>\
more days together,] not on alternate days: and<br>\

the trans. verb, [for شَاخِصٌ بَصَرَهُ,] (Msb,) (assumed tropical:)  [A<br>\
man raising his eye, or sight, and looking fixedly;<br>\
as does a dying man: or stretching and raising<br>\
his sight: (see 1:) or] a man opening his eyes and<br>\
not moving his eyelids. (S, * Msb.)<br>\
[<br>\
مَشْخَصٌ, as though signifying The place of a<br>\
شَخْص used in the sense of صُورَةِ: accord. to<br>\
modern usage sing. of] مَشَاخِصُ deenárs [or pieces<br>\
of gold] figured [or stamped with effigies]. (TA.)<br>\
مُشَخَّصٌ (tropical:)  A thing individuated. (A, TA.)<br>\
مُتَشَاخِصٌ Discordant; (A&#39;Obeyd, K;) applied<br>\
to language, or speech; (A&#39;Obeyd, TA;) and to<br>\
a thing, or an affair; (TA;) and مُتَشَاخِسٌ signifies the same. (A&#39;Obeyd, TA.)<br>\
