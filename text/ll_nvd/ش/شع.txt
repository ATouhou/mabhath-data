accord. to another, تَشَعْسَعَ, with two سs. (TA.)<br>\
شَعٌّ: see شَعَاعٌ, first and last sentences.<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\

شَعَاعٌ. (TA.)<br>\
شُعٌّ A spider&#39;s web. (AA, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
شُعَاعٌ.<br>\
شَعَاعٌ [an inf. n. (see 1) used as an epithet, and<br>\

the former] to anything, (K, TA,) such as blood,<br>\

(TA;) and ↓ شَعِيعٌ, which is wrongly expl. in the<br>\
K as syn. with شَعٌّ in another sense, as stated<br>\
above; (TA;) and ↓ شَعْشَاعٌ. (S, K.) One says,<br>\
ذَهَبَ دَمُهُ شَعَاعًا His blood went scattered, or dispersed: (TA:) or شَعَاعٌ applied to blood signifies<br>\
spirtling from a wound made with a spear or the<br>\
like; as in a verse cited voce نَفَذٌ. (Az, TA. [See<br>\
also شُعَاعٌ.]) And ذَهَبُوا شَعَاعًا They went away<br>\
scattered, or dispersed. (K.) And أُمَّةٌ شَعَاعٌ A<br>\
nation, or people, scattered, or dispersed. (TA,<br>\
from a trad.) And تَطَايَرَتِ العَصَا شَعَاعًا The staff,<br>\
or stick, broke into scattered pieces; as when one<br>\
has broken it by striking with it upon a wall:<br>\
and in like manner, القَصَبَةُ the reed, or cane.<br>\
(TA.) And رَأْىٌ شَعَاعٌ A disordered, or an unsettled, opinion. (S, K.) And نَفْسٌ شَعَاعٌ A mind<br>\
of which the purposes, or intentions, (هِمَمُهَا, as in<br>\
the S [and O], for which, in the K, هُمُومُهَا is<br>\
erroneously substituted, TA,) and the opinions,<br>\
(Z, TA,) are disordered, or unsettled, (S, K,<br>\
TA,) so that it is not directed to a decided affair.<br>\
(Z, TA.) And طَارَ فُؤَادُهُ شَعَاعًا [His mind fled in<br>\
a disordered, or an unsettled, state, as though<br>\
dissipated; expl. as] meaning تَفَرَّقَتْ هُمُومُهُ [a<br>\
mistranscription, as before: correctly تفرّقت هِمَمُهُ<br>\
i. e. his purposes, or intentions, became disordered,<br>\
or unsettled: see also Ham p. 44, and Har p.<br>\
366]. (K.) And a rájiz says,<br>\
الغَدَرْ ↓ صَدْقُ اللِّقَآءِ غَيْرُ شَعْشَاعِ<br>\
meaning [Firm, or steady, in encounter, or conflict,] not disordered, or unsettled, in respect of<br>\

or beams, of the sun; or] what one sees, (S, O,<br>\

like spears, (O, K,) at the rising, or the beginning<br>\
of the rising, (S,) or a little after the rising, (O,<br>\
K,) of the sun; (S, O, K;) or what one sees, like<br>\
cords coming towards him, when looking at the<br>\
sun; or the dispersing light of the sun: (K:)<br>\
n. un. with ة: (S, O, K) [and Freytag states that<br>\
↓ شِعْشِعَةٌ is said by Jac. Schultens to signify<br>\
rays: but this I do not find in any lexicon:] the<br>\
pl. (of شُعَاعٌ, O) is أَشِعَّةٌ, (O, K,) accord. to<br>\
analogy, (O,) [a pl. of pauc.,] and شُعُعٌ (O, K)<br>\

having no rays]. (S: in the O, مِنْ غَدِهَا.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In<br>\
the verse cited voce نَفَذٌ, As is related to have<br>\
read الشُّعَاعُ instead of الشَّعَاعُ, as meaning The<br>\
light, [or brightness] and redness, and scattered<br>\
state, of the blood: ISd says, I know not whether<br>\
he said it meaning by original application or by<br>\
way of comparison. (TA.) ―<br>\
