شَبَثَ,<br>\
inf. n. شَبَثٌ: (L, TA:) or, accord. to Esh-Shiháb,<br>\
in the Expos. of the Shifè, to a thing in which<br>\
was weakness: or, accord. to the &#39;Ináyeh, he, or<br>\
it, clung, &amp;c., to it with weakness; and therefore<br>\
↓ مُتَشَبِّثٌ is used as an epithet applied to a spider;<br>\
and تَمَسُّكَ signifies a stronger action; and تشبّث<br>\
به is also expl. as meaning he, or it, took fast, or<br>\
firm, hold upon it: (L, TA:) and he stuck, or<br>\
fixed, or struck, the claw, or talons, or nails,<br>\
into it: (MA, PS:) and الشَّىْءَ ↓ شَبِثَ he laid<br>\
hold upon the thing, and took it: IAar was<br>\
asked respecting some verses, and he said, مَا<br>\
أَدْرِى مِنْ أَيْنَ شَبِثْتُهَا I know not whence I laid<br>\
hold upon them [and took them]. (L, TA.)<br>\
Q. Q. 1<br>\
accord. to the S and L, شَنْبَثَ: see<br>\

شَبَثٌ The spider: (K:) or a large spider,<br>\
with many legs. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (K) A certain<br>\
small creeping thing, (S, A, Msb, K,) having<br>\
many legs, (S, A, K,) of the أَحْنَاش [or creeping<br>\
things &amp;c.] of the earth: (S, Msb:) it should not<br>\
be called شِبْثٌ: (S:) or a certain small creeping<br>\
thing, having six long legs, yellow in the back,<br>\
and in the outer sides of the legs, black in the<br>\
head, and blue in the eye: or a certain small<br>\
creeping thing, having many legs, large in the<br>\
head, of the احناش of the earth: or a certain<br>\
small creeping thing, wide in the mouth, high in<br>\
the hinder part, that perforates the ground, is<br>\
found where there is moisture, and eats scorpions; and it is what is called شَحْمَةُ الأَرْضِ:<br>\
(TA:) pl. شِبْثَانٌ. (S, A, Msb, K.) The [marks<br>\
termed] أَثْر of the blade of a sword are likened by<br>\
a poet, (S, TA,) namely, Sá&#39;ideh Ibn-Ju-eiyeh,<br>\
(TA,) to the tracks of شِبْثَان. (S, TA.)<br>\
رَجُلٌ شَبِثٌ A man whose nature it is to cling,<br>\
catch, cleave, or adhere, to a thing. (S, K.) And<br>\
ضِرْسٌ ضَبِثٌ شَبِثٌ [A tooth, or molar tooth,] that<br>\
catches, or fastens, to a thing. (TA.)<br>\
شُبَثَةٌ, (K,) or شُبَثَةٌ ضُبَثَةٌ, (TA,) A man (TA)<br>\
who cleaves to his قِرْن [i. e. opponent, or adversary], not quitting him. (K, TA.)<br>\
شِبِثٌّ [erroneously written in some copies of the<br>\
K شِبْثٌ, and in the L شِبِثٌ,] A certain wellknown plant; (AHn, L, Msb;) a certain herb,<br>\
or leguminous plant; (K;) [i. q. شِبِتٌّ and سِبِتٌّ,<br>\
q. v.; i. e. anethum graveolens, or dill, of the<br>\
common garden-species:] Sgh says that شبث is a<br>\
foreign word of which سِبِتٌّ is an arabicized form;<br>\
and it is made of the measure فِعِلٌّ because this<br>\
measure has many examples; whereas the measure فِعِلٌّ, of which إِبِلٌ is an instance, is extraordinary. (Msb.)<br>\
شَبَّاثٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
شَبُّوثٌ and ↓ شَبَّاثٌ [so in the CK and in my<br>\
MS. copy of the K, but the latter is strangely<br>\
said in the TA to be with kesr,] sings. of شَبَابِيثُ,<br>\
which signifies The flesh-hooks (كَلَالِيب) of the<br>\
fire. (K.)<br>\
