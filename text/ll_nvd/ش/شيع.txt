or manifest; (Msb, TA;) فِى النَّاسِ [among the<br>\
people]; so as to reach every one, becoming<br>\
equally known by the people, not known by some<br>\
exclusively of others. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,]<br>\
شاع, aor. as above, said of a thing, signifies also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  It became scattered, or dispersed; like شَعَّ.<br>\
(TA in art. شع.) You say, شاع اللَّبَنُ فِى المَآءِ,<br>\
(Msb,) or شاعت قَطْرَةٌ مِنَ اللَّبَنِ فِى المَآءِ, and<br>\
↓ تشيّعت, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  The milk, (Msb,) or the drop<br>\
of milk, (TA,) became dispersed in the water,<br>\

السَّلَامُ [Safety, or peace, &amp;c., be, or light and<br>\
abide, on you]; (S, O, K;) but is only said by a<br>\
man to his companions when he desires to quit<br>\
them: (S, O:) or it means [may safety, &amp;c.,]<br>\
follow you: (O, K:) or, not quit you: (K:)<br>\
whence, (TA,) one says also شَاعَكَ الخَيْرُ may<br>\
prosperity not quit thee; and in like manner<br>\
Lebeed says of praise (حَمْدٌ): (O, TA:) [and J<br>\
says that] شاعهُ, inf. n. شِيَاعٌ, signifies he, or it,<br>\
followed him: (S:) or شاعكم السلام, (Yoo, O, K,)<br>\
aor. يَشَاعُكُم, inf. n. شَيْعٌ, (Yoo, O,) means [may<br>\

(TA,) which means he called to the camels, (K in<br>\
another part of the art., and TA,) when some of<br>\
them remained, or lagged, behind: (TA:) and [in<br>\

بِسِتَّةٍ] (assumed tropical:)  I made [the fasting of] Ramadán to be<br>\
followed by [the fasting of] six [days] of Showwál expl. by أَتْبَعْتُهُ بِهَا [a well-known phrase, of<br>\
frequent occurrence, but one which I have not<br>\
found in any of the lexicons, except in explanations; the approved phrase used in its stead being<br>\
أَتْبَعْتُهُ إِيَّاهَا, lit. meaning “ I made them to follow<br>\
it; ” this being virtually the same as “ I made it to be<br>\
followed by them ”]: (Msb:) [and in like manner,<br>\
the elliptical phrase] شيّع رَمَضَانَ, (K,) or شيّع شَهْرَ<br>\
رَمَضَانَ, (O, TA,) means He fasted after Rama-<br>\
dán, or the month of Ramadán, six days; (O,<br>\

(O, Msb,) namely, a guest, (Msb,) in order to bid<br>\
him farewell, and to conduct him to his place of<br>\
alighting, [app. meaning, to his first place of<br>\
alighting,] (Lth, O, K,) or to show honour, or<br>\
courtesy, to him; and I bade him farewell:<br>\
(Msb:) or شيّع الضَّيْفَ signifies he followed the<br>\
guest [app. on the occasion of his departure, in<br>\
order to bid him farewell, &amp;c.]: (Mgh:) or<br>\
شيّعهُ عِنْدَ رَحِيلِهِ he went forth with him on the<br>\

by his company to some place: and ↓ شايعهُ signifies the same. (TA.) ―<br>\

always going behind him]. See المُشَيِّعَةُ, voce مُشَيَّعٌ.<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  He burned him, or it, with fire. (S, K, TA.)<br>\

مُشَايَعَةٌ primarily signifies The following<br>\
another, or conforming with him, in, or as to, an<br>\
affair, and an opinion; as also شِيَاعٌ; [an inf. n. of<br>\
شايعهُ, like the former;] and so too signifies<br>\
↓ تَشَيُّعٌ [if not a mistranscription for ↓ تَشْيِيعٌ,<br>\
which I rather think it to be, agreeably with what<br>\
follows]: and the agreeing, or complying, with<br>\
him, or obeying him. (TA.) You say, شايعهُ<br>\
عَلَى أَمْرٍ, (Lth, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. مُشَايَعَةٌ (Msb)<br>\
[and شِيَاعٌ], He followed him, or conformed with<br>\

likewise على رَأْىٍ in, or as to, an opinion; as<br>\
also عَلَيْهِ ↓ شيّعهُ, referring to an opinion [and an<br>\
affair]. (TA.) And مَا تُشَايِعُنِى رِجْلِى وَلَا سَاقِى<br>\
My leg does not conform with [my wish] nor aid<br>\
me to walk, nor does my shank. (TA.) And<br>\
شَايَعَتْهُ نَفْسُهُ عَلَى ذٰلِكَ His soul conformed [or<br>\

friendly to him; syn. وَالَاهُ, (S, O, K,) from<br>\
الوَلِىُّ. (S.) ―<br>\

also, شَايَعَ بِهِمُ الدَّلِيلُ فَأَبْصَرُوا الهُدَى The guide<br>\
called to them [and they saw the right direction].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  الشِّيَاعُ occurs in a trad., as some relate<br>\
it, and is expl. as there meaning المُفَاخَرَةُ بِكَثْرَةِ<br>\
الجِمَاعِ: but AA says that it is a mistranscription<br>\
for السِّبَاعُ, with س and ب; or that it may be from<br>\
شَاعَةٌ signifying “ a wife. ” (IAth, TA.)<br>\

secret. (L, TA.) And اشاع ذِكْرَ الشَّىْءِ He made<br>\

K; expl. in the K in two places;) but this is only<br>\

-b5-  اشاع بِالإِبِلِ: see 2. ―<br>\

تَشَفَّعَ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [Accord. to Golius, it is expl.<br>\
in the KL as meaning He left a portion of a<br>\

شِيعَةٌ A separate, or distinct, party, or sect,<br>\

opinion. (S.) The saying, in the Kur [xxxiv.<br>\
last verse], كَمَا فُعِلَ بِأَشْيَاعِهِمْ مِنْ قَبْلُ means As<br>\
was done with the likes of them, of the same persuasion as they, of the peoples that have gone<br>\
before: (S, * TA:) and similar to this is the saying<br>\

&#39;Alee, saying that he was the [rightful] Imám<br>\
after the Apostle of God, and believing that the<br>\
office of Imám should not depart from him and<br>\

people, who are innovators; the extravagant<br>\
zealots among them are the Imámeeyek, who<br>\
revile the Two Sheykhs [Aboo-Bekr and &#39;Omar];<br>\
and the most extravagant of them call the Two<br>\
Sheykhs disbelievers: some of them rise to the<br>\
pitch of [that misbelief which is termed] الزَّنْدَقَة<br>\
[q. v.]. (TA.) [It is also applied to A single<br>\
person of this party, or sect; agreeably with what<br>\
has been said above; and such a person is likewise<br>\

former is the more chaste, (O, [and the same is<br>\
implied in the K,]) (tropical:)  Slender firewood, with<br>\
which a fire is made to blaze or flame, burn up,<br>\
or burn brightly or fiercely: (S, O, K, TA:) and<br>\
↓ شَيُوعٌ signifies [the same, i. e.] slender firewood<br>\
(AHn, O, K) that is quickly kindled by a weak<br>\
fire, so that it prevails over the thick, or large,<br>\
firewood. (AHn, O.)<br>\
شَيُوعٌ: see next preceding sentence.<br>\
شَيِّعٌ A sharer, or partner: (TA:) pl. شُيَعَآءُ.<br>\
(O, K, TA.) One says, هُمْ شُيَعَآءُ فِيهَا [They are<br>\
sharers, or partners, in it, i. e. a house (دَار) or<br>\
land;] i. e. every one of them is a شَيِّع to his<br>\
fellow [or fellows]. (O, K.) And ↓ هُمَا مُتَشَايِعَانِ<br>\
فِى دَارٍ, (O, K,) or أَرْضٍ; (O;) and ↓ مُشْتَاعَانِ,<br>\
(O, TA,) in the copies of the K, erroneously,<br>\
مُتَشَاعَانِ; (TA;) They two are sharers, or partners, in a house, (O, K,) or land. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
الدَّارُ شَيِّعَةٌ بَيْنَهُمْ The house is undivided [i. e.<br>\
shared] among them; syn. ↓ مُشَاعَةٌ. (O, K. [See<br>\
also شَائِعٌ.])<br>\

of news, a narrative, or a story, spreading; or<br>\
becoming spread, published, divulged, revealed,<br>\
made known, disclosed, apparent, or manifest;<br>\
فِى النَّاسِ [among the people]; so as to reach<br>\
every one, becoming equally known by the people,<br>\
not known by some exclusively of others: (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ شَاعَةٌ [is app. a pl. thereof, like as بَاعَةٌ is of<br>\
بَائِعٌ, signifying, or so أَخْبَارٌ شَاعَةٌ,] news, or<br>\
tidings, &amp;c., spreading, or becoming spread.<br>\
(IAar, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [(assumed tropical:)  A thing scattered, or dispersed, or in a state of dispersion: fem. with ة:<br>\
pl. of the latter شَوَائِعُ; which may also be pl. of<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  The horsemen came scattered, or dispersed, or<br>\

O;) and ↓ مُشَاعٌ; (S, K;) [i. e. shared in common;<br>\
as though] spread; (TA;) so called because<br>\
mixed, not being separated: (Msb:) [and it<br>\
seems, from the usage of a phrase in art. خلط of<br>\
the K, (المُشَارِكُ فِى الشُيُوعِ,) that ↓ شَيْعٌ, as sing.<br>\
of شُيُوعٌ, signifies an undivided portion.] ―<br>\
-b4-  Also<br>\
