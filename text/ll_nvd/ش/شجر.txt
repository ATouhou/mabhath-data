perhaps the verb in this sense is in the passive<br>\

CK with ز,]) which are the قَادِمَة and the آخِرَة,<br>\

being what conjoins the ظَلِفَتَانِ [in the fore part<br>\
of the saddle and in like manner in the hinder<br>\
part]: the part between the كَرَّانِ is also called<br>\
the شَخْر. (TA in the present art. [It is there<br>\
said that this part is also called the شَرْخ as well as<br>\

شِيَرٌ, (K,) in which last the ج is changed into ى,<br>\
like as the ى is changed into ج, as in غَنِجٌّ, originally غَنِىٌّ, or, accord. to IJ, the ى in شِيَرٌ is<br>\
not changed from ج because it remains ى in the<br>\
dim., in which, where it so changed, it should be<br>\
changed back into ج, whereas the dim. of شِيَرَةٌ is<br>\
said to be شُيَيْرَةٌ and شِيَيْرَةٌ, and because it has kesr<br>\
instead of fet-h to the ش, [whence it appears that<br>\
IJ knew not شِجَرٌ,] (TA,) [as coll. gen. ns.,<br>\
Trees; and shrubs, or bushes; which latter are<br>\
also called, for distinction, دِقُّ الشَّجَرِ; and sometimes applied to plants in general; and, as a<br>\

(TA:) the pl. [of شَجَرٌ] is أَشْجَارٌ (S, Msb) and [of<br>\
شَجَرَةٌ] شَجَرَاتٌ (Msb, TA) and [of شِيَرَةٌ] شِيَرَاتٌ:<br>\
(TA:) ↓ شَجْرَآءُ also signifies the same as شَجَرٌ:<br>\
(K:) or it is a pl. [or rather a quasi-pl. n.] of<br>\
شَجَرَةٌ; a pl. [or quasi-pl. n.] of which there are<br>\
few other instances; قَصْبَآءُ of قَصَبَةٌ, and طَرْفَآءُ of<br>\
طَرَفَةٌ, and حَلْفَآءُ of حَلَفَةٌ; or, accord. to As, the<br>\
sing. [or n. un.] of حلفآءُ is حَلِفَةٌ: and accord.<br>\
to Sb, شَجْرَآءُ is sing. and pl., and so are قَصْبَآءُ and<br>\

Paradise, by the former is said to be meant The<br>\
grape-vine: or the tree beneath which allegiance<br>\
was sworn to the Prophet; and which, it is said,<br>\
was a شَمُرَة [or gum-acacia-tree]: (TA:) and by<br>\
the latter, the صخرة [or rock] of Jerusalem. (TA<br>\
in art. صخر, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b4-  By الشَّجَرَةُ الطَّيِّبَةُ, mentioned in the Kur in xiv. 29, is said to be meant<br>\

in the Kur xvii. 62, means The tree called الزَّقُّوم:<br>\

-b5-  شَجَرَةٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The stock, or origin, of a<br>\
man: (O, TA:) [hence,] one says, هُوَ مِنْ شَجَرَةٍ<br>\

(so in my copy of the A, and accord. to the CK,)<br>\
or ضرعها ↓ شَجْرَةَ, (O, and so accord. to the text<br>\
of the K as given in the TA, [but Z has, in the<br>\
A, distinguished the phrase as tropical, and hence<br>\
it seems that he held the former reading to be<br>\
the right,]) (tropical:)  How goodly are the shape, (A,) or<br>\
the size, (O, K,) and the appearance, of her<br>\
