treated, by him: (L, Msb, K, KL:) or, as some<br>\
say, مُشَاحَنَةٌ is such reviling, and blaming, upbraiding, or reproaching, reciprocally, as does<br>\
not amount to fighting one another; from شَحْنَآءُ<br>\

(see 1, last sentence; and 3;) or] with enmity. (L.)<br>\
شَحْنَةٌ [thus written, with fet-h to the ش, but I<br>\

part of the Sultán. (Az, L, K. *) And (K) A<br>\

country or town. (S, L.) IB says that the<br>\
vulgar usage of this word as syn. with أَمِيرٌ [i. e.<br>\
A commander or commandant, &amp;c., being used<br>\
app. only in post-classical times, from the Pers.<br>\
شَحْنَهْ, meaning in Pers., and hence in Arabic<br>\

the saying, كَانَ بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ أَخِيهِ شَحْنَآءُ i. e.<br>\
[There was between him and his brother] enmity.<br>\
(L.)<br>\
شُحُون in the following verse, cited by ISd,<br>\
تَأَطَّرْنَ فِى المِينَآءِ ثُمَّ تَرَكْنَهُ<br>\
وَقَدْ لَجَّ مِنْ أَحْمَالِهِنَّ شُحُونُ<br>\
may be, accord. to him, an inf. n. of شَحَنَ, or an<br>\
extr. pl. of شِحْنَةٌ: (L:) [but I rather think that<br>\
it is a pl. of ↓ شَاحِنٌ, like as شُهُودٌ is of شَاهِدٌ; and<br>\
accordingly I would render the verse (which<br>\
evidently relates to ships) thus: They kept close<br>\
in the port, then they left it, and laders had persisted in contention by reason of their burdens,<br>\
i. e. the burdens of the ships, because of the<br>\
labour that they occasioned.]<br>\
شَاحِنٌ [act. part. n. of شَحَنَ]: see the next<br>\
preceding paragraph. ―<br>\

لَكَ [He is bearing enmity &amp;c. towards thee]. (L.)<br>\
مَشْحُونٌ A ship (فُلْكٌ, so in the Kur [xxvi.<br>\
119 &amp;c.], S, L, or مَرْكَبٌ, K [in the L, erroneously, رَكَبٌ],) Filled [or laded, and completely<br>\
equipped or furnished: see 1, first sentence];<br>\
(S, L, K;) as also ↓ شَاحِنٌ, like كَاتِمٌ in the sense<br>\
of مُكْتُومٌ, (L, K,) mentioned by Kr. (L.)<br>\
مُشْحَئِنٌّ Becoming angered; or made angry.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
عَدُوٌّ مُشَاحِنٌ [An enemy who regards, or treats,<br>\
another with rancour, &amp;c., being so regarded, or<br>\
treated by him: see 3]. (S, L.) المُشَاحِنُ as<br>\
used in a trad. means The schismatic innovator<br>\
in religion: (L, K:) so says El-Owzá&#39;ee: or the<br>\
transgressor: (L:) or it means he who has in his<br>\
