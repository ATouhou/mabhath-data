-A4-  And شَفِرَ, aor.<br>\
شَفَرَ, It decreased, diminished, or became defective or deficient. (IAar, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
شفّرها, (K,) inf. n. تَشْفِيرٌ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,<br>\
K,) He compressed her (i. e. a woman, Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O) on the شُفْر of her فَرْج. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And شَفَّرْتُ الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. as above, I<br>\
eradicated, or extirpated, the thing. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\

(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,) said of a man, (assumed tropical:)  He was, or<br>\

4<br>\
اشفر is said in the Tekmileh to signify He<br>\
(a camel) strove, or exerted himself, in running:<br>\
but perhaps it should be اشغر, mentioned before<br>\
[in art. شغر]. (TA.)<br>\
شَفْرٌ: see the next paragraph, in four places.<br>\
شُفْرٌ The place of growth of the eyelash, (Sh, T,<br>\
S, A, Msb, K,) which is the edge of the eyelid;<br>\
(S, Msb;) as also ↓ شَفْرٌ (Kr, A, K) and ↓ شَفِيرٌ:<br>\
(K:) or, accord. to some, this last signifies the<br>\
upper side of the inner angle of the eye: (TA:)<br>\
and with the vulgar, the first signifies the eyelash; but this is [said to be] a mistake: (IKt,<br>\
Msb:) it occurs, however, in this sense, in a<br>\
trad. of Esh-Shaabee; (IAth, TA;) and in like<br>\
manner the pl. occurs in another trad.; but the<br>\
word شَعَر should be considered as understood<br>\
before it; or what grows is thus called by the<br>\
name of the places of growth, and the like of this<br>\
is not rare: (Mgh:) it is of the masc. gender:<br>\
(Lh, K:) and the pl. is أَشْفَارٌ, (Sb, S, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
the only pl. form. (Sb, TA.) [Hence,] one says,<br>\
↓ مَا بِالدَّارِ شَفْرٌ, (Ks, Fr, T, S, Msb, K,) and شُفْرٌ,<br>\
(Lh, Msb, K,) but Sh disallows this latter, (TA,)<br>\
and ↓ شَفْرَةٌ, (Fr, Sgh, K,) (tropical:)  There is not in the<br>\
house any one: (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.:) and مَا رَأَيْتُ<br>\
↓ مِنْهُمْ شَفْرًا (tropical:)  I saw not of them any one: from the<br>\
شفر of the eye: meaning one having a شفر: (A:)<br>\
and شفر is also used in this sense without a negation. (TA.) One says likewise, مَا تَرَكَتِ السَّنَةُ<br>\
ظُفْرًا وَلَا شُفْرًا (tropical:)  The year of drought left not<br>\
anything: and sometimes they said ↓ شَفْرًا, with<br>\
fet-h, and in this case they said ظَفْرًا, for assimilation. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S A, Mgh, Msb, K,) and<br>\
↓ شَفِيرٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) The edge, border, margin,<br>\
brink, brow, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or side, (A, K,) of<br>\
anything; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) as of a valley<br>\
and the like, (S,) or as of a river &amp;c.: (Mgh and<br>\
Msb, in relation to the latter word:) one says,<br>\
النَّهْرِ ↓ قَعَدُوا عَلَى شَفِيرِ, and البِئْرِ, and القَبْرِ, They<br>\
sat upon the side of the river, and of the well, and<br>\
of the grave: (A:) and both words signify the<br>\
side of the upper part of a valley. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
الشُّفْرُ, (K,) or شُفْرُ الفَرْجِ, (Msb,) and شُفْرُ المَرْأَةِ,<br>\
(TA,) The edge, (Msb, K,) or border, (TA,) of<br>\
the vulva, or external portion of the organs of<br>\
generation, [meaning, of each of the labia majora,]<br>\
of a woman: (Msb, K, TA:) pl. أَشْفَارٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
the إِسْكَتَانِ are the two sides [or labia majora] of<br>\
the vulva of a woman; and the شُفْرَانِ are the<br>\
two borders of the said اسكتان: (AHeyth, Mgh,<br>\
TA:) Lth says that the ↓ شَافِرَانِ are [two parts]<br>\
of the pudendum muliebre: (TA:) and شُفْرُ الرَّحِمِ<br>\
and ↓ شَافِرُهَا signify [in like manner] the edges of<br>\
the vulva: (S:) and شُفْرَا المَرْأَةِ and ↓ شَافِرَاهَا, the<br>\
two edges of the رَحِم [or vulva (for الرَّحِم is here<br>\
used tropically, for الفَرْج, as it is in many other<br>\
instances,)] of a woman. (TA.)<br>\

signification, on the authority of Meyd;]) or a<br>\

and شَفَرَاتٌ (Msb) and [coll. gen. n., of which<br>\
شِفْرَةٌ is the n. un., or it may be a quasi-pl. n. of<br>\
شَفْرَةٌ,] ↓ شِفْرٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\

ears: (S:) or having large ears: or having long<br>\
ears, and bare toes, [in the CK, for العَارِى البَرَاثِنِ,<br>\

a prov., أَرَاكَ بَشَرٌ مَا أَحَارَ مِشْفَرٌ [lit. External skin<br>\
hath shown thee what a lip hath transmitted to<br>\
the stomach;] meaning, the external appearance hath rendered thee in no need of inquiring<br>\
respecting the internal state: (S, K:) originally<br>\
said of a camel; (TA;) for when you see his<br>\
external skin, whether he be fat or lean, you take<br>\
it as an indication of the quality of his food.<br>\
(K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The vulva, or external portion<br>\

مِشْفَرِ الأَسَدِ [which may be rendered I left him<br>\
at the like of the lip of the lion]; (TA;) applied<br>\
