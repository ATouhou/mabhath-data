became tall, (S, K, TA,) and tangled and dense,<br>\

a mistake with respect to both of these verbs, the<br>\
latter of which is well known to be trans. only by<br>\
means of عَلَى.])<br>\
-A5-  [And i. q. أَشْبَهَ.] One says,<br>\

العَقْرَبُ;]) a proper name thereof; it may be from<br>\
الشَّبَا signifying its sting; (Ham p. 385;) determinate; (TA;) imperfectly decl.: (A&#39;Obeyd, S,<br>\
TA:) it is said in the K, “and [the article] ال<br>\
is prefixed to it; ” but this is a mistake: it should<br>\
be, “and ال is not prefixed to it: (TA:) [but,<br>\
although a proper name, it has a pl.;] the pl. is<br>\
