شَسَعَ النَّعْلَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
شَسَعَ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. شَسْعٌ, (O, K,) He put a شِسْع [q. v.]<br>\
to the sandal; (S, * Msb, * K;) as also ↓ شَسَّعَهَا,<br>\
and ↓ أَشْسَعَهَا. (S, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  شَسِعَتِ النَّعْلُ, aor.<br>\
شَسَعَ,<br>\
The sandal had its شِسْع broken. (Ibn-Buzurj, O,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شَسِعَ الفَرَسُ, aor. as above, inf. n. شَسَعٌ,<br>\
The horse had a gap, or space, between his central incisor and the tooth next to it. (Aboo-Málik, IDrd, O, K. *)<br>\
-A3-  شَسَعَ, aor. as above,<br>\
inf. n. شَسْعٌ and شُسُوعٌ, It was, or became, distant,<br>\
or remote; said of a place of alighting, or abode.<br>\
(K.) And, said of anything, i. q. تَنَآءَى [It was<br>\
or became, far from another thing]: and شَخَصَ<br>\
[it rose, &amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شَسَعَ He put, or<br>\
sent, or removed, him, or it, away, or far away;<br>\
as also ↓ اشسعهُ. (TA.)<br>\

شَسَّعَ see the preceding paragraph.<br>\

أَشْسَعَ see 1, first and last sentences.<br>\
شِسْعٌ (S, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and شِسِعٌ (K) and<br>\
↓ شِسْعَنٌّ, so in some of the copies of the K, (TA,)<br>\
[thus in my MS. copy of the K, and also in the<br>\
O,] with an augmentative ن, (O, TA,) The قِبَال<br>\
of the sandal; (K;) [i. e.] the appertenance of<br>\
the sandal that is attacked, or tied, to its زِمَام;<br>\
(S;) [meaning] one of the thongs, or straps, or<br>\
strips of leather, of the sandal, being that which<br>\
passes between two toes, of which the [lower]<br>\
end enters the hole, or perforation, that is in the<br>\
fore part of the sandal, and which is attacked<br>\
[at its upper end] to the زِمَام [or, as it is also<br>\
called, the شِرَاك, a thong, or strap, or strip of<br>\
leather, extending towards the ankle, and having<br>\
two arms, (its عَضُدَانِ,) which are attacked to<br>\
the أُذُنَانِ (q. v.), or pass through these and unite<br>\
behind the foot]: (IAth, TA:) a poet says, referring to camels,<br>\
↓ أَحْدُو بِهَا مُنْقَطِعًا شِسْعَنِّى<br>\
[I urge them on by singing to them, with the<br>\
interdigital thong of my sandal broken]: (Lth, O,<br>\
TA:) the pl. of شِسْعٌ is شُسُوعٌ (S, O, Msb, K,<br>\
TA) and أَشْسَاعٌ: (O, K, TA:) ISd and Z affirm<br>\
that it has only the former pl.; but AHei contradicts this: (TA:) the latter pl. [a pl. of pauc.]<br>\
occurs in the saying of &#39;Obeyd Ibn-Eiyoob El-<br>\
&#39;Amberee,<br>\
يُدِيرُ نَعْلَيْهِ لِئَلَّا تُعْرَفَا<br>\
يَجْعَلُ أَشْسَاعَهُمَا نَحْوَ القَفَا<br>\
[He turns round his sandals, in order that they<br>\
may not be known by their prints upon the ground;<br>\
putting the interdigital thongs thereof in the<br>\
direction of the back of the neck]. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] قِبَالُ الشِّسْعِ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The serpent;<br>\
mentioned by IAar with قِبَالُ الشِّبْرِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And شِسْعٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The extremity of a<br>\
place. (O, K.) One says, حَلَلْنَا شِسْعَ الدَّهْنَآءِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [We alighted in the extremity of the sandy<br>\
desert, or of the desert called Ed-Dahnà]. (O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A narrow tract of land. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And (tropical:)  Somewhat remaining of property or cattle.<br>\
(IAar, O, K, TA.) And (K) (tropical:)  A small quantity<br>\
or number of property or cattle. (Mohárib, O,<br>\
K, TA.) One says, لَهُ شِسْعُ مَالٍ (tropical:)  He has a small<br>\
quantity of property, or a small number of cattle;<br>\
(Mohárib, O, K, TA;) or a small collection of<br>\
camels and of sheep or goats: (K, TA:) and Fr<br>\
adds مَالٍ ↓ شَسِيعُ [app. in the same sense: but see<br>\
another explanation of شِسْعُ مَالٍ in what follows].<br>\
(O.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And (tropical:)  The greater portion or number of<br>\
property or cattle. (El-Mufaddal, O, K, TA.)<br>\
Thus it has two contr. [?] significations. (K.)<br>\
One says, ذَهَبَ شِسْعُ مَالِهِ (tropical:)  The greater portion<br>\
of his property, or the greater number of his<br>\
cattle, went, or passed, away. (El-Mufaddal, O,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And فُلَانٌ شِسْعُ مَالٍ (tropical:)  Such a one is a<br>\
good manager of cattle or camels &amp;c.; (S, O, K,<br>\
TA;) one who keeps assiduously to the tending, or<br>\
pasturing, thereof: (A, TA:) and Fr says, هُوَ<br>\
مَالٍ ↓ شَسِيعُ, as syn. with شِسْعُ مَالٍ. (TA: [but<br>\
see above.])<br>\
شِسْعَنٌّ: see شِسْعٌ, in two places.<br>\
شَسُوعٌ: see شَاسِعٌ.<br>\
شَسِيعُ مَالٍ: see شِسْعٌ, in two places.<br>\
شَاسِعٌ A man having his شِسْع broken. (O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also Distant, or remote; and so ↓ شَسُوعٌ:<br>\
(S, O, K:) both applied to a place of alighting, or<br>\
abode: (O, K:) pl. [of either, irreg.,] شُسْعٌ. (K.)<br>\
One says بِلَادٌ شَاسِعَةٌ [Distant countries or towns].<br>\
(Msb.) And رَجُلٌ شَاسِعُ الدَّارِ A man whose<br>\
house, or abode, or country, is distant. (TA.)<br>\
And شَفَرٌ شَاسِعٌ A far journey. (TA.)<br>\
