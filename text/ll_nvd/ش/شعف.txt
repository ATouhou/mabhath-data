شَعَفَ, (S, O, K,) aor.<br>\
شَعَفَ, (K,) inf. n. شَعَفٌ,<br>\
though it is implied in the K, by its being said<br>\
that the verb is like مَنَعَ, that it is شَعْفٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He smeared, anointed, or overspread, a camel<br>\
[suffering from the mange, or scab], with tar,<br>\
(S, O, K, and Bd in xii. 30,) and burned him by<br>\
so doing. (Bd ibid.) Imra-el-Keys says,<br>\
لِيَقْتُلَنِى وَقَدْ شَعَفْتُ فُؤَادَهَا<br>\
كَمَا شَعَفَ المَهْنُوْءَةَ الرَّجُلُ الطَّالِى<br>\
[That he should slay me, I having overspread her<br>\
heart with love of me, like as the man anointing<br>\
overspreads her (meaning the camel) that is<br>\
smeared with tar]: but it is also related otherwise,<br>\
i. e. قَطَرْتُ فُؤَادَهَا كَمَا قَطَرَ: (O, TA:) Aboo-&#39;Alee<br>\
El-Kálee says that she [the camel] that is smeared<br>\
with tar experiences, by reason of the tar, a<br>\
pleasurable sensation with a burning. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, [as indicated above,] قَدْ شَعَفَهَا حُبًّا [He<br>\
has overspread and burned her heart with love];<br>\
as some read in the Kur xii. 30; others reading<br>\
شَغَفَهَا: (Bd:) [or he has burned her heart with<br>\
love; for] شَعَفَهُ الحُبُّ means love burned his<br>\
heart: (S:) there are two readings of the words<br>\
of the Kur above; (O, K;) [as well as two other<br>\
readings mentioned in art. شغف;] قَدْ شَعَفَهَا حُبًّا,<br>\
(S, O, K,) one, a reading of El-Hasan (S, O) and<br>\
others; meaning [as above: or], accord. to AZ,<br>\
he has diseased her heart with love, (S, * O,) and<br>\
melted it: (O:) or, accord. to El-Hasan, he has<br>\
penetrated into her with love: (S:) the other<br>\
reading is قَدْ شَعِفَهَا حُبًّا, (O, K,) meaning he has<br>\
become attached to her with love, and loved her<br>\
excessively: (O:) [but it is also said that] شَعَفَنِى<br>\
حُبُّهُ means The love of him overspread my heart<br>\
from above; (O, K;) from شَعَفَةٌ signifying the<br>\
“ head ” of the heart, “at the place of suspension<br>\
of [or from] the نِيَاط; ” (O, * K;) and in like manner, شُعِفْتُ بِهِ and بِحُبِّهِ, (O, and so in the CK,)<br>\
or شَعِفْتُ: (so in other copies of the K, in which,<br>\
and in the CK, the verb in this case is said to be<br>\
like فَرِحَ: [but this I regard as a mistake:]) and<br>\
شَعَفَ القَلْبَ He, or it, struck, or smote, the<br>\
شَعَفَة, or uppermost part, of the heart: (Ham p.<br>\
545:) Az, however, says, I know not any one<br>\
that has assigned to the heart a شَعَفَة, except Lth;<br>\
and vehement love takes possession of the core<br>\
(سَوَاد) of the heart; not of its extremity: [but]<br>\
accord. to Fr, شُعِفَ بِفُلَانٍ, like عُنِىَ, means The<br>\
love of such a one rose to the highest places of his<br>\
heart: others say that الشعف [app. الشَّعَفُ] signifies the being frightened, and disquieted, like the<br>\
beast when it is frightened; and that the Arabs<br>\
transferred its attribution from beasts to human<br>\
beings: (TA:) Abu-l-&#39;Alà says that الشَّعَفُ signifies a thing&#39;s falling into the heart: (IB, TA:)<br>\
one says also, شَعَفَهُ المَرَضُ Disease melted him:<br>\
(TA:) and accord. to AZ, شُعِفَ بِكَذَا means He<br>\
became diseased by such a thing. (S.)<br>\
شَعَفٌ: see شَعَفَةٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The<br>\
upper, or uppermost, part of the hump of the<br>\
camel: (O, K:) Lth says that it is like the heads<br>\
of truffles, and the three stones upon which the<br>\
cooking-pot is placed, that are round in their<br>\
upper, or uppermost, parts. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Vehemence of love: (L:) [or simply love: for] one<br>\
says, أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ شَعَفَهُ, meaning [He cast] his love<br>\
[upon him, or it]; as also شَغَفَهُ. (TA.)<br>\
شَعَفَةٌ The head [or summit] of a mountain:<br>\
(S, O, K:) and the upper, or uppermost, part of<br>\
anything: (Ham pp. 130 and 545:) pl. ↓ شَعَفٌ<br>\
[or rather this is a coll. gen. n., and accord. to<br>\
Freytag it is used as a sing., in the two senses<br>\
above mentioned, in the Deewán of Jereer,] and<br>\
[the pl. is] شُعُوفٌ and شِعَافٌ and شَعَفَاتٌ: (S, O,<br>\
K:) and ↓ شَعَفٌ is also expl. as signifying an<br>\
elevated part of the earth or ground. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also A lock of hair (خُصْلَةٌ) upon the head, (K,)<br>\
or upon the upper, or uppermost, part of the<br>\
head. (O, TA.) And شِعَافٌ (its pl., TA) signifies The hair of the head: so in the phrase رَجُلٌ<br>\
صُهْبُ الشِّعَافِ [A man whose hair of the head is<br>\
red, or red in the outer part and black beneath,<br>\
or of a red colour tinged over with blackness,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The [pendent lock of<br>\
hair termed] ذُؤَابَة of a boy, or young man. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And شَعَفَةُ القَلْبِ signifies The head of the<br>\
heart, at the place of suspension of [or from] the<br>\
نِيَاط [q. v.]. (O, TA. [But see, in the first<br>\
paragraph, what Az says respecting this meaning.])<br>\
شَعَافٌ, like سَحَابٌ, Love&#39;s making away with<br>\
the heart. (TA.)<br>\
شُعَافٌ Insanity, or madness. (O, K.)<br>\
[<br>\
شُعَيْفَةٌ dim. of شَعَفَةٌ: pl. شُعَيْفَاتٌ.] One says,<br>\
مَا عَلَى رَأْسِهِ إِلَّا شُعَيْفَاتٌ There is not upon his<br>\
head aught save some small hairs of the [pendent<br>\
lock of hair termed] ذُؤَابَة. (S, O, K.)<br>\
مَشْعُوفٌ [Burned in the heart by love: (see 1:)<br>\
or] diseased [therein]: (AZ, S:) or struck, or<br>\
smitten, in the شَعَفَة of his heart by love, or by<br>\
fright, or by insanity, or madness. (O, K.)<br>\
Insane, or mad. (O, K.) Bereft of his heart.<br>\
(TA.) [See also مَشْغُوفٌ.]<br>\
