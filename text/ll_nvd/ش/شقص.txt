and a pig: (L, A, TA:) or he divided it (namely,<br>\
a pig,) into parts or portions, and members, for<br>\

بَاعَ الخَمْرَ فَلْيُشَقِصِ الخَنَازِيرَ (L, A) He who sells<br>\
wine, let him cut up swine and divide their<br>\
members, as is done to a sheep or goat when its<br>\
flesh is sold: meaning, he who holds the selling<br>\
of wine to be lawful, let him hold the selling of<br>\
swine to be so; for they are equally forbidden.<br>\
(L, TA.)<br>\
شِقْصٌ A piece, or part, of a thing; (S, M,<br>\

Mgh, K;) like نِصْفٌ and نَصِيفٌ: (M:) as, for<br>\
instance, in property; (IDrd;) and of a slave:<br>\

called: (Az, TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَشْقَاصٌ (M, Msb)<br>\
and [of mult.] شِقَاصٌ. (M, TA.)<br>\
شَقِيصٌ: see شِقْصٌ, throughout.<br>\
-A2-  Also A<br>\

having such a نصل, (Lth, IF, K,) with which<br>\
wild animals are shot; (Lth;) but Az says that<br>\
this explanation is at variance with what has been<br>\
heard from the Arabs: (TA:) or it signifies, (M,)<br>\

a broad one: (M:) or an arrow having such a<br>\
نصل; (M;) with which wild animals are shot:<br>\
(K:) or a long and broad نصل: (S:) or it is of<br>\
half the size of a نصل, and is worthless; children<br>\

[-head], and is used for shooting at objects of the<br>\
chase and any other thing: (TA:) pl. مَشَاقِصُ. (S.)<br>\
مُشَقِصٌ A butcher. (A, K.)<br>\
