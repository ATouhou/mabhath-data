شَنِبَ, aor.<br>\
شَنَبَ, (K,) inf. n. شَنَبٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
had the quality termed شَنَبٌ meaning as expl.<br>\
below. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And It (a day) was, or became,<br>\
cool, or cold. (A, K.)<br>\
شَنَبٌ Lustre, and fineness, or delicacy, or thinness, and coolness, and sweetness, in the teeth:<br>\
(A, K:) or lustre, and fineness, or delicacy, or<br>\
thinness, in the fore teeth: (TA:) or these two<br>\
qualities, together with coolness and sweetness, in<br>\
the mouth, accord. to As, or in the teeth: (TA:)<br>\
or coolness and sweetness in the teeth: or sharpness of the teeth: (S:) or sharpness of the canine<br>\
teeth, like غَرْبٌ, so that they appear like a saw:<br>\
(K:) or white specks in the teeth: (A, K:) or the<br>\
state of the teeth when they appear somewhat<br>\
tinged with blackness, like the appearance of<br>\
blackness in hail; غُرُوبٌ signifying the “ lustre ”<br>\
of the teeth; and ظَلْمٌ, their “ whiteness that is as<br>\
though there were over it a blackness: ” (ISh,<br>\
TA:) Abu-l-&#39;Abbás says, It is variously expl., as<br>\
a serrated state of the teeth: and their clearness<br>\
and cleanness: and their being separate, or apart,<br>\
one from another: and the sweetness of their<br>\
odour: (TA:) El-Jarmee says, I heard As say<br>\
that this word signifies coolness of the mouth and<br>\
teeth; and I said, Our companions say that it is<br>\
their sharpness when they come forth; by which<br>\
is meant their new, or recent, and fresh state; for<br>\
when they have undergone the lapse of years,<br>\
they become abraded, or worn: but he said, It is<br>\
nothing but their coolness: and the saying of<br>\
Dhu-r-Rummeh,<br>\
وَفِى اللِّثَاتِ وَفِى أَنْيَابِهَا شَنَبُ<br>\
[which should be rendered And in the gums, and<br>\
in her canine teeth, is coolness], corroborates the<br>\
assertion of As; for there is no sharpness in the<br>\
gum: (S, L, TA:) it is also related of As that he<br>\
said, I asked Ru-beh respecting the meaning of<br>\
شَنَبٌ, and he took a grain of pomegranate, and<br>\
pointed to its lustre: (Mz, TA:) [and ↓ شُنْبَةٌ signifies the same:] a poet says,<br>\
مُنَصَّبُهَا حَمْشٌ أَحَمُّ يَزِينُهُ<br>\
عَوَارِضُ فِيهَا شُنْبَةٌ وَغُرُوبُ<br>\
[Her even set of front teeth are slender and white,<br>\
side teeth in which are coolness and lustre adorning<br>\
them]. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [In the present day, it signifies The mustache.]<br>\
شَنِبٌ and ↓ شَانِبٌ, (A, K,) the former regular,<br>\
the latter on the authority of usage, (TA,) A cool,<br>\
or cold, day. (A, K.)<br>\
شُنْبَةٌ Coolness, or coldness, of a day. (O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also شَنَبٌ, near the end.<br>\
شَنِيبٌ: see أَشْنَبُ.<br>\
شَانِبٌ: see شَنِبٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and what here follows.<br>\
أَشْنَبُ Having the quality termed شَنَبٌ meaning<br>\
as expl. above; (A, O, K;) as also ↓ شَانِبٌ, (K,)<br>\
which is irregular, (TA,) and ↓ شَنِيبٌ, (K,)<br>\
[which is likewise irregular;] but the first of<br>\
these three is the most common: (TA:) applied<br>\
to a man, (O,) and to the ثَغْر [or front teeth],<br>\
(A,) [and to the mouth, as in a verse cited voce<br>\
زَرْنَبٌ:] fem. شَنْبَآءُ, (S, O, K,) applied to a woman,<br>\
(S, O,) and also written شَمْبَآءُ, (K,) the ن being<br>\
changed into م because of the following ب, and<br>\
in like manner [the pl. شُنْبٌ is also written]<br>\
شُمْبٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شَنْبَآءُ also signifies A pomegranate (رُمَّانَةٌ) such as is termed إِمْلِيسِيَّةٌ, having<br>\
no grains, but only juice within the rind, (A, K,<br>\
TA,) in the form of grains without stones. (TA.)<br>\
مِشْنَبٌ A young boy whose teeth are sharp and<br>\
serrated by reason of his youthfulness. (IAar,<br>\
O.)<br>\
مَشَانِبُ Sweet mouths. (O, K.)<br>\
