شَنُعَ, aor.<br>\
شَنُعَ, inf. n. شَنَاعَةٌ (S, O, Msb, K)<br>\
and شَنَعٌ and شَنَاعٌ, but this last, occurring in a<br>\
verse, may be used by poetic license for شَنَاعَةٌ,<br>\
(TA,) It (a thing, S) was, or became, bad, evil,<br>\
abominable, foul, or unseemly; (S, * O, * Msb, K;)<br>\
syn. قَبُحَ. (Msb. [In the S and O and K, it is<br>\
said that شَنَاعَةٌ signifies the same as فَظَاعَةٌ; but<br>\
the latter seems to import more than the former.])<br>\
-A2-  شَنَعَ فُلَانًا He regarded such a one as bad, evil,<br>\
abominable, foul, or unseemly, (اِسْتَقْبَحَهُ, S, O, K,<br>\
TA, in the CK اسْتَخَفَّهُ,) and reviled, or vilified,<br>\
him, (شَتَمَهُ, O, K, TA, and so accord. to one of<br>\
my copies of the S,) or loathed him, (سَئِمَهُ,) thus<br>\
in some of the lexicons, [and accord. to one of my<br>\
copies of the S,] but [SM says that] شَتَمَهُ is shown<br>\
to be the right reading by the saying of IAar that<br>\
شَنَعَهُ, inf. n. شَنْعٌ, means سَبَّهُ. (TA.) [See also<br>\
10.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (O, K,) inf. n. شَنْعٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
disgraced such a one; put him to shame; or<br>\
exposed his vices, faults, or evil qualities or actions. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And شَنَعَ الخِرْقَةَ He<br>\
frayed the torn-off piece of cloth so that it became shaggy (شَعَّثَهَا حَتَّى تَنَفَّشَ): (O, K: [in the<br>\
CK, in the place of the last word of the explanation, which is for تَتَنَفَّشَ, is put تَنْفَشَّ:]) and in<br>\
like manner one says of a thing similar to a<br>\
خِرْقَة. (O.)<br>\
-A3-  شَنِعَ بِهِ: see 10.<br>\
2<br>\
التَّشْنِيعُ signifies تَكْثِيرُ الشَّنَاعَةِ [app. meaning<br>\
The uttering, or saying, much, or often, what is<br>\
bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly: and the<br>\
doing what is bad &amp;c. much or often]: (K:) or<br>\
the uttering, or saying, what is bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly, (KL, PS,) against any<br>\
one: (PS:) and the representing, or regarding, as<br>\
bad, &amp;c.: (KL, PS: *) and the committing [an<br>\
action that is bad, &amp;c., or] a fault, or vitious<br>\
action. (KL.) You say, شَنَّعْتُ عَلَيْهِ, inf. n.<br>\
تَشْنِيعٌ, (S, O,) I uttered, or said, what was bad,<br>\
evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly, against him:<br>\
(PS:) from الشَّنَاعَةُ. (O.) And شنّع عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرَ,<br>\
inf. n. as above, He showed, or declared, to him<br>\
that the affair was bad, evil, &amp;c.: (TA: [see also<br>\
5:]) or characterized the affair to him as bad,<br>\
evil, &amp;c. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  And The striving, labouring,<br>\
or exerting oneself, and being quick, and vigorous,<br>\
or energetic, syn. التَّشْمِيرُ, (S, O, K, TA, [in the<br>\
CK, erroneously, التَّشْهِيرُ,]) and الاِنْكِمَاشُ, and<br>\
الجِدُّ, (O, K,) in pace, or going; (O, * K;) as also<br>\
↓ التَّشَنُّعُ (K) [and ↓ الإِشْنَاعُ]: thus شنّع is said of<br>\
a man, meaning He strove, laboured, or exerted<br>\
himself, and was quick: (TA:) and in like manner شَنَّعَتْ is said of a she-camel, (As, A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
S, O,) and of camels, (O,) as also ↓ تشنّعت, (S, *<br>\
O, expl. in the former by جَدَّتْ only,) and<br>\
↓ اشنعت; (O;) in pace, or going: (S, O:) or<br>\
↓ اشنعت said of a she-camel means she was quick,<br>\
or swift. (K.)<br>\

تشنّع القَوْمَ He showed, or declared, the case<br>\
of the people, or party, to be bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly, by reason of their disagreement, and the unsound, or unsettled, state of<br>\
their opinion. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And تشنّع He (a man)<br>\
purposed to do a bad, an evil, an abominable, a<br>\
foul, or an unseemly, thing or affair. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also 2, last sentence, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence,<br>\
(IAar, TA,) He prepared himself for fight:<br>\
(IAar, K, TA:) or, said of a party of men, they<br>\
prepared themselves for fight: (O:) and accord.<br>\
to AA, تشنّع لِلشَّرِّ He prepared himself for evil,<br>\
or mischief. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And It ( a garment, or<br>\
piece of cloth,) became rent, or slit. (O, K.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
تشنّع الغَارَةَ He spread, or dispersed, the horsemen<br>\
making a raid, or sudden attack, upon an enemy.<br>\
(AA, S, O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تشنّع الفَرَسَ He<br>\
mounted the horse. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And تشنّع<br>\
السِّلَاحَ He put on the weapon, or weapons. (S,<br>\
O, K.)<br>\
10<br>\
استشنعهُ He reckoned it bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly. (O, TA.) And accord.<br>\
to Lth, (O, TA,) one says, بِهِ ↓ رَأَى أَمْرًا شَنِعَ,<br>\
meaning استشنعهُ, (O, K, TA,) i. e. [He saw a<br>\
thing] which he regarded as bad, evil, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And accord. to him, one says also, قَدِ اسْتَشْنَعَ<br>\
بِفُلَانٍ جَهْلُهُ, (O, TA,) meaning His ignorance<br>\
has rendered such a one light, inconstant, or unsteady. (TA.)<br>\
شَنِعٌ: see شَنِيعٌ.<br>\
شُنْعَةٌ the subst. from شَنُعَ; (S, O, K;) [i. e.]<br>\
Badness, evilness, abominableness, foulness, or<br>\
unseemliness; syn. قُبْحٌ; (Har p. 196;) as also<br>\
↓ شُنُوعٌ: (O, K:) thus in the saying, فِى فُلَانٍ<br>\
↓ شُنُوعٌ [In such a one is unseemliness, or ugliness]; as also نَظْرَةٌ and رَدٌّ [or rather رَدَّةٌ]: (TA:)<br>\
and one says also, فِى وَجْهِهِ شُنْعَةٌ and رَدَّةٌ and نَظْرَةٌ<br>\
[app. meaning In his face is unseemliness, or<br>\

شَنِيعٌ Bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly;<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ شَنِعٌ (O, K) and ↓ أَشْنَعُ,<br>\
(S, O, K,) the last like أَكْبَرُ in the phrase اَللّٰهُ<br>\
أَكْبَرُ, meaning كَبِيرٌ, accord. to one of the two<br>\
interpretations of this phrase: (O, TA:) pl. of the<br>\
first شُنُعٌ. (Msb, TA. *) It is applied to a day, in<br>\
this sense: or as meaning disliked, or hated:<br>\
(TA:) and so is ↓ أَشْنَعُ, (S, O, K, TA,) in the<br>\
former sense, (TA,) or in the latter. (O, K, TA.)<br>\
And you say مَنْظَرٌ شَنِيعٌ and ↓ مُشَنَّعُ [An aspect<br>\
that is bad, evil, &amp;c.] and ↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ مُشَنَّعَةٌ, meaning<br>\
قَبِيحَةٌ [i. e. An unseemly, or ugly, woman]. (TA.)<br>\
And اِسْمٌ شَنِيعٌ [An evil, or abominable, name]:<br>\
and قَوْمٌ شُنُعُ الأَسَامِى [A people, or party, having<br>\
evil, or abominable, names]. (A, TA.) And<br>\
↓ قِصَّةٌ شَنْعَآءُ [An evil, or abominable, or a foul,<br>\
story]. (TA.) And ↓ غَيْرَةٌ شَنْعَآءُ Abominable,<br>\
excessive jealousy: (O, K, TA:) in [some of] the<br>\
copies of the K, erroneously, غبرة. (TA.)<br>\
شَنَعْنَعٌ Incongruous, unsound, weak, or faulty,<br>\
[and therefore unseemly,] in make; (IDrd, O, K,<br>\
TA;) as also الخَلْقِ ↓ أَشْنَعُ; applied to a man:<br>\
the former is from الشُّنُوعُ: and some say that it<br>\
signifies tall. (TA.)<br>\

places: and see also شَنَعْنَعٌ.<br>\
