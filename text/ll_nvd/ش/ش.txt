ش<br>\
The thirteenth letter of the alphabet: called<br>\
شِينٌ. It is one of the letters termed مَهْمُوسَة [or<br>\
non-vocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only,<br>\
without the voice]; and of the letters termed<br>\
شَجْرِيَّة, (TA,) from الشَّجْرُ, which means “ the<br>\
place of the opening of the mouth. ” (TA on the<br>\
letter ج. See also شِيْنٌ in art. شين.) It is sometimes substituted for the affixed pronoun of the<br>\
second pers. fem., كِ; as in رَأَيْتُشِ for رَأَيْتُكِ, and<br>\
as in the following verse,<br>\
فَعَيْنَاشِ عَيْنَاهَا وَجِيدُشِ جِيدُهَا<br>\
وَلٰكِنَّ السَّاقِ مِنْشِ رَقِيقُ<br>\
[And thy two eyes are her two eyes, and thy neck<br>\
is her neck; but the bone of thy shank is slender];<br>\
i. e. عَيْنَاكَ and جِيْدُكِ and مِنْكِ: this substitution<br>\
for the affixed pronoun of the second pers. fem.<br>\
is of dial. of Benoo-&#39;Amr and Temeem; and<br>\
is not restricted to cases of pausation, as is shown<br>\
by the verse above cited, though some assert it to<br>\
be so: it is also substituted for the ك of دِيك,<br>\
when with kesr, so that they said دِيشٍ: also for<br>\
جٍ, as in مُدَمَّشٌ[or مُدْمَشٌ], for مُدَمَّجٌ [or<br>\
مُدْمَجٌ]: and for س, as in جَعْشُوشٌ, for جَعْسُوسٌ.<br>\

Three hundred.]<br>\
