شَكَلَ, as an intrans. verb: see 4, in three<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  And see 5.<br>\
-A2-  شَكَلَ الفَرَسَ بِالشِّكَالِ, (S,)<br>\
or شَكَلَ الدَّابَّةَ, (Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
شَكُلَ, inf. n. شَكْلٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) He bound [the horse or] the beast, with<br>\
the شِكَال; (Msb;) [i. e.] he bound the legs of<br>\
[the horse or] the beast with the rope called شِكَال;<br>\
as also ↓ شَكَّلَهَا, (K,) inf. n. تَشْكِيلٌ. (TA.) And<br>\
شَكَلْتُ الطَّائِرَ [app. I bound the legs of the bird in<br>\
like manner]. (S.) And شَكَلْتُ عَنِ البَعِيرِ I<br>\
bound the camel&#39;s شِكَال between the fore girth and<br>\
the hind girth; (S;) [i. e.] I put [or extended],<br>\
between the hind girth and the fore girth of the<br>\
camel, a cord, or string, called شِكَال, and then<br>\
bound it, in order that the hind girth might not<br>\
become [too] near to the sheath of the penis.<br>\
(TA in art. حقب.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence, i. e.] from<br>\
the شِكَال of the beast, (TA,) شَكَلَ الكِتَابَ, (AHát,<br>\
S, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. as above, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  He restricted [the meaning or pronunciation of]<br>\
the writing, (قَيَّدَهُ, AHát, S, TA,) or he marked<br>\
the writing, (أَعْلَمَهُ, Msb,) with the signs of the<br>\
desinential syntax (AHát, * S, * Msb, TA *) [and<br>\
the other syllabical signs and the diacritical<br>\
points]: or i. q. أَعْجَمَهُ: (K:) but AHát says that<br>\
شَكَلَ الكِتَابَ has the former meaning; and أَعْجَمَهُ<br>\
signifies he dotted, or pointed, it [with the diacritical points]: (TA:) and الكِتَابَ ↓ اشكل signifies the same as شَكَلَهُ; (S, Msb, K, TA;) as though<br>\
[meaning] he removed from it dubiousness and<br>\
confusion; (S, K, * TA;) so that the أ in this case<br>\
is to denote privation: (TA:) this [J says (TA)]<br>\
I have transcribed from a book, without having<br>\
heard it. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And شَكَلَتْ شَعْرَهَا, (O, TA,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
شَكُلَ; thus correctly, as pointed by IKtt; accord.<br>\
to the K ↓ شكّلت; (TA;) (assumed tropical:)  She (a woman)<br>\
plaited two locks of her hair, of the fore part of<br>\
her head, on the right and left, (O, K, TA,) and<br>\
then bound with them her other ذَوَائِب [or pendent locks or plaits]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And شكل [thus<br>\
in the TA, so that it may be either شَكَلَ or ↓ شكّل,]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He (the lion) compressed the lioness: on the<br>\
authority of IKtt. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  شَكِلَتْ, aor.<br>\
شَكَلَ; (K,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. شَكَلٌ, (TA,) She (a woman) used<br>\
amorous gesture or behaviour; or such gesture, or<br>\
behaviour, with coquettish boldness, and feigned<br>\
coyness or opposition; displayed what is termed<br>\
شِكْل, i. e. غُنْج and دَلّ and غَزَل; (K, TA;) and<br>\
↓ تشكّلت [signifies the same], i. e. تَدَلَّلَتْ [and in<br>\
like manner تشكّل is said of a man]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also شَكَلٌ below, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
شَكِلْتُ إِلَى كَذَا, with kesr [to the ك], i. q. رَكَنْتُ<br>\
[i. e. I inclined to such a thing; or trusted to, or<br>\
relied upon, it, so as to be, or become, easy, or<br>\
quiet, in mind]. (O.)<br>\
2<br>\
شكّل, as an intrans. verb: see 4: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see<br>\
also 5.<br>\
-A2-  شكّلهُ, inf. n. تَشْكِيلٌ, He formed,<br>\
fashioned, figured, shaped, sculptured, or pictured,<br>\
it; syn. صَوَّرَهُ; (K, TA;) namely, a thing. (TA.)<br>\

3<br>\
مُشَاكَلَةٌ signifies The being conformable,<br>\
suitable, agreeable, similar, homogeneous, or congenial; syn. مُوَافَقَةٌ; (S, K;) as also ↓ تَشَاكُلٌ:<br>\
(IDrd, S, K:) Er-Rághib [strangely] says that<br>\
المُشَاكَلَةُ is from الشَّكْلُ signifying “ the binding,”<br>\
or “ shackling,” a beast [with the شِكَال]. (TA.)<br>\
You say, هُوَ يُشَاكِلُهُ [He, or it, is conformable,<br>\
&amp;c., with him, or it; or resembles him, or it].<br>\
(Msb.) And هٰذَا الأَمْرُ لَا يُشَاكِلُكَ i. e. لَا يُوَافِقُكَ<br>\
[This affair will not be suitable to thee]. (TA.)<br>\
And ↓ تَشَاكَلَا They resembled each other. (MA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اشكل [primarily] signifies صَارَ ذَا شَكْلٍ<br>\
[meaning It, or he, was, or became, such as had<br>\
a likeness or resemblance, or a like, or match, &amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence, app.,] said of a thing, or<br>\
case, or an affair; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ شَكَلَ, (O, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, شَكِلَ,<br>\
evidently not meant by the author of the K, as it<br>\
is his rule, after mentioning a verb of this form,<br>\
to add كَفَرِحَ or the like,]) inf. n. شَكْلٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ شكّل, (K,) inf. n. تَشْكِيلٌ; (TA;) (assumed tropical:)  It was,<br>\
or became, dubious, or confused; syn. اِلْتَبَسَ, (S,<br>\
O, Msb, K,) and اِخْتَلَطَ, (O, TA,) or اِشْتَبَهَ:<br>\
(Mgh:) [and ↓ اشتكل is mentioned in this sense<br>\
by Golius as on the authority of J (whom I do<br>\
not find to have mentioned it either in this art. or<br>\
elsewhere), and by Freytag as on the authority of<br>\
Abu-l-&#39;Alà: accord. to Sh, اشكل in this sense is<br>\
from شُكْلَةٌ signifying “ redness mixed with whiteness: ” (see مُشْكِلٌ:) but] accord. to Er-Rághib,<br>\
إِشْكَالٌ in a thing, or case, or an affair, is metaphorical, [and] like اِشْتِبَاهٌ from الشِبْهُ. (TA.)<br>\
One says, اشكل الأَمْرُ عَلَى الرَّجُلِ (assumed tropical:)  [The thing,<br>\
or case, or affair, was, or became, dubious, or<br>\
confused, to the man]; and ↓ شَكَلَ means the<br>\
same. (Zj, O.) And أَشْكَلَتْ عَلَىَّ الأَخْبَارُ (assumed tropical:)  [The<br>\
tidings were dubious, or confused, to me], and<br>\
أَحْكَلَتْ; both meaning the same. (TA.) And<br>\
one says also, عَلَيْهِ إِشْكَالٌ and عليه إِشْكَالَاتٌ<br>\
[meaning There is doubt, or uncertainty, and<br>\
there are doubts, or uncertainties, respecting it:<br>\
thus using the inf. n. as a simple subst., and therefore pluralizing it]. (Mz, 3rd نوع; &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is<br>\
also said of a disease; [app. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  It became nearly cured; because still in a somewhat<br>\
doubtful state;] like as you say تَمَاثَلَ; and so<br>\
↓ شَكَلَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اشكل النَّخْلُ The palm-trees<br>\
became in that state in which their dates were<br>\
sweet (Ks, S, A, O, K) and ripe, (Ks, S, O, Msb,)<br>\
or nearly ripe; (A, TA;) and ↓ تشكّل signifies<br>\
the same. (O.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And اشكلت العَيْنُ The eye<br>\
had in it what is termed شُكْلَةٌ [q. v.: see also<br>\
شَكَلٌ]. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  اشكل الكِتَابَ: see 1.<br>\
5<br>\
تشكّل It (a thing, TA) was, or became,<br>\
formed, fashioned, figured, shaped, sculptured, or<br>\
pictured; syn. تَصَوَّرَ. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He<br>\
became goodly in shape, form, or aspect. (TK in<br>\
art. طرز.) ―<br>\
-b3-  تشكّل العِنَبُ, (S, K,) and ↓ شَكَلَ, and<br>\
↓ شكّل, (K,) The grapes became in that state in<br>\
which some of them were ripe: (S, K:) or became<br>\
black, and beginning to be ripe: (K:) thus in the<br>\
M. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 4, near the end. ―<br>\

استشكلهُ is often used by the learned in the<br>\
present day as meaning He deemed it (i. e. a word<br>\
or phrase or sentence) dubious, or confused.]<br>\
شَكْلٌ i. q. شَبَةٌ [as meaning A likeness, resemblance, or semblance; a well-known signification<br>\
of the latter word, but one which I do not find<br>\
unequivocally assigned to it in its proper art. in any<br>\
of the lexicons]. (AA, K, TA. [In the CK, and<br>\
in my MS. copy of the K, in the place of الشَّبَهُ as<br>\
the first explanation of الشَّكْلُ in the K accord. to<br>\
the TA, we find الشِّبْهُ; but that the explanation<br>\
which I have given is correct, is shown by what<br>\
here follows.]) One says, فِى فُلَانٍ شَكْلٌ مِنْ أَبِيهِ,<br>\
meaning شَبَهٌ [i. e. In such a one is a likeness, or<br>\
resemblance, of his father]: (AA, TA:) and<br>\
مِنْ أَبِيهِ ↓ فِيهِ أَشْكَلَةٌ and ↓ شُكْلَةٌ (AA, O, K, TA)<br>\
and ↓ شَاكِلٌ, (O, K, TA,) [likewise] meaning<br>\
شَبَهٌ, (AA, O, K, TA,) and مُشَابَهَةٌ: (TK:) and<br>\
↓ شَاكِلَةٌ also is syn. with شَكْلٌ [in the sense of<br>\
شَبَهٌ]; (K, TA;) [for] one says, هٰذَا عَلَى شَاكِلَةِ<br>\
أَبِيهِ as meaning شَبَهِهِ [i. e. This is accordant to<br>\
the likeness of his father]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And I. q.<br>\
مِثَالٌ: you say, هٰذَا عَلَى شَكْلِ هٰذَا, meaning على<br>\
مِثَالِهِ [i. e. This is according to the model, or<br>\
pattern, or the mode, or manner, of this]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And The shape, form, or figure, (صُورَة,) of a<br>\
thing; such as is perceived by the senses; and such<br>\
as is imagined: (K:) the form (هَيْئَة), of a body,<br>\
caused by the entire contents&#39; being included by<br>\
one boundary, as in the case of a sphere; or by<br>\
several boundaries, as in those bodies that have<br>\
several angles or sides, such as have four and such<br>\
as have six [&amp;c.]: so says Ibn-El-Kemál: (TA:)<br>\
pl. [of pauc., in this and in other senses,] أَشْكَالٌ<br>\
and [of mult.] شُكُولٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [It often means<br>\
A kind, sort, or variety, of animals, plants, food,<br>\
&amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b5-  [And The likeness, or the way or manner,<br>\
of the actions of a person:] it is said in a trad.<br>\
respecting the description of the Prophet, سَأَلْتُ<br>\
أَبِى عَنْ شَكْلِهِ, meaning [I asked my father<br>\
respecting the likeness of his actions, or] respecting<br>\
what was like his actions; accord. to IAmb: or,<br>\
accord. to Az, respecting his particular way,<br>\
course, mode, or manner, of acting, or conduct:<br>\
(O:) and ↓ شَاكِلَةٌ [likewise, and more commonly,] signifies a particular way, course, mode,<br>\
or manner, of acting, or conduct; (S, O, K, TA;)<br>\
as in the saying, كُلٌّ يَعْمَلُ عَلَى شَاكِلَتِهِ, (S, O,<br>\
TA,) in the Kur [xvii. 86], (O, TA,) i. e. Every<br>\
one does according to his particular way, &amp;c.,<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, S, O, Bd, Jel, TA,) that is suitable<br>\
to his state in respect of right direction and of<br>\
error, or to the essential nature of his soul, and<br>\
to his circumstances that are consequent to the<br>\
constitution, or temperament, of his body: (Bd:)<br>\
and according to his nature, or natural disposition,<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, Er-Rághib, O, TA,) by which he is<br>\
restricted [as with a شِكَال]: (Er-Rághib, TA:)<br>\
and his direction towards which he would go:<br>\
(Akh, S, O, K, * TA:) and his side [that he<br>\
takes]: (Katádeh, O, K, * TA:) and his aim,<br>\
intention, or purpose: (Katádeh, O, K, TA:)<br>\
and شَكْلٌ [likewise] signifies aim, intention, or<br>\
purpose; syn. قَصْدٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also A thing that<br>\
is suitable to one; or fit, or proper, for one: you<br>\
say, هٰذَا مِنْ هَوَاىَ وَمِنْ شَكْلِى [This is of what<br>\
is loved by me and of what is suitable to me]:<br>\
(K, TA:) and لَيْسَ شَكْلُهُ مِنْ شَكْلِى [What is<br>\
suitable to him is not of what is suitable to me].<br>\
(TA.) [And hence, app.,] one says, مَاشَكْلِى وَشَكْلُهُ,<br>\
meaning What is my case and [what is] his, or<br>\
its, case? because of his, or its, remoteness from<br>\
me. (T and TA voce أُمٌّ.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And sing. of أَشْكَالٌ<br>\
(L, K, TA) signifying Discordant affairs and<br>\
objects of want, concerning things on account of<br>\
which one imposes upon himself difficulty and for<br>\
which one is anxious: (Lth, TA:) and dubious,<br>\
or confused, affairs: (TA:) or discordant, and<br>\
dubious, or confused, affairs. (K. [In the CK,<br>\
المُشَكَّلَة is erroneously put for المُشْكِلَة.])<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
A like; syn. مِثْلٌ; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) and so<br>\
↓ شِكْلٌ: (O, K:) or, as some say, the like of<br>\
another in nature or constitution: (Msb: [and<br>\
accord. to Er-Rághib, it seems that the attribute<br>\
properly denoted by it is congruity between two<br>\
persons in respect of the way or manner of acting<br>\
or conduct: but in the passage in which this is<br>\
expressed in the TA, I find erasures and alterations which render it doubtful:]) pl. أَشْكَالٌ (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, K *) and شُكُولٌ [as above]. (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K. *) One says, هٰذَا شَكْلُ هٰذَا This is the<br>\
like of this. (Msb.) And فُلَانٌ شَكْلُ فُلَانٍ Such<br>\
a one is the like of such a one in his several states<br>\
or conditions [&amp;c.]. (TA.) In the saying in the<br>\
Kur [xxxviii. 58], وَآخَرُ مِنْ شَكْلِهِ, (O, TA,)<br>\
meaning And other punishment of the like thereof,<br>\
(Zj, TA,) Mujáhid read ↓ من شِكْلِهِ. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also sing. of أَشْكَالٌ signifying, (O, K,) accord.<br>\
to IAar, (O,) Certain ornaments (O, K) consisting of pearls or of silver, (K,) resembling one<br>\
another, worn as ear-drops by women: (O, K:)<br>\
or, as some say, the sing. signifies a certain thing<br>\
which girls, or young women, used to append to<br>\
their hair, of pearls or of silver. (O.)<br>\
-A4-  And A<br>\

colour, (K,) yellow and red. (IAar, O, K.)<br>\
-A5-<br>\
[And The various syllabical signs, or vowel-points<br>\
&amp;c., by which the pronunciation of words is indicated and restricted: originally an inf. n., and<br>\
therefore thus used in a pl. sense.]<br>\
-A6-  See also<br>\
the next paragraph.<br>\
شِكْلٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, latter<br>\
part, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also, as an attribute of a<br>\
woman, Amorous gesture or behaviour; or such<br>\
gesture, or behaviour, combined with coquettish<br>\
boldness, and feigned coyness or opposition; syn.<br>\
دَلٌّ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and غُنْجٌ, and غَزَلٌ; (K;<br>\
[in the CK, غَزْل, which is a mistranscription;])<br>\
or her غُنْج, and comely or pleasing دَلّ, whereby<br>\
a woman renders herself comely or pleasing;<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ شَكْلٌ signifies the same. (K.) One<br>\
says اِمْرَأَةٌ ذَاتُ شِكْلٍ [A woman having amorous<br>\
gesture or behaviour; &amp;c.]. (S, O, Msb.)<br>\
شَكَلٌ, in a sheep or goat, The quality of being<br>\
white in the شَاكِلَة. (S, O. [See أَشْكَلُ.]) [In<br>\
this sense, accord. to the TK, an inf. n., of which<br>\
the verb is ↓ شَكِلَ, said of a ram &amp;c.]. ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
in an eye, The quality of having what is termed<br>\
شُكْلَة [q. v.]. (S, O.) [Accord. to the TK, in<br>\
this sense also an inf. n., of which the verb is<br>\
↓ شَكِلَ, said of a thing, as meaning It had a redness in its whiteness.]<br>\
شُكْلَةٌ: see شَكْلٌ, first signification. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says<br>\
also, فِيهِ شُكْلَةٌ مِنْ سُمْرَةٍ [In him, or it, is an<br>\
admixture of a tawny, or brownish, colour], and<br>\
شُكْلَةٌ مِنْ سَوَادٍ [an admixture of blackness]:<br>\
(TA:) [or] شُكْلَةٌ signifies redness mixed with<br>\
whiteness: (Sh, Msb, TA:) in camels, (K, TA,)<br>\
and in sheep or goats, (TA,) blackness mixed<br>\
with redness, (K, TA,) or with dust-colour: in<br>\
the hyena, accord. to IAar, a colour in which are<br>\
blackness and an ugly yellowness: (TA:) in the<br>\
eye, a redness in the white: (Mgh:) or, in the<br>\
eye, i. q. شُهْلَةٌ [q. v.]: (K:) or, accord. to AO,<br>\
(TA,) the like of a redness in the white of the<br>\
eye; (S, O, TA;) and such was in the eyes of the<br>\
Prophet; (O;) but if in the black of the eye, it is<br>\
termed شُهْلَةٌ: (S, O, TA:) and the like is in the<br>\
eyes of the [hawks, or falcons, termed] صُقُور and<br>\
بُزَاة: accord. to some, it is yellowness mixing with<br>\
the white of the eye, around the black, as in the<br>\
eye of the hawk (الصَّقْر); but he [i. e. AO] says,<br>\
I have not heard it used except in relation to<br>\
redness, not in relation to yellowness. (TA.)<br>\
فِيهِ شُكْلَةٌ مِنْ دَمٍ means In him, or it, is a little<br>\
[or a small admixture] of blood. (TA.)<br>\
شَكِلَةٌ A woman using, or displaying, what is<br>\

on the authority of IAar; (O;) accord. to Er-Rághib, such as binds, or shackles, (تُقَيِّد,) a man<br>\
[as though with a شِكَال]. (TA.) One says,<br>\
↓ لَنَا قِبَلَكَ أَشْكَلَةٌ [&amp;c.] i. e. حَاجَةٌ [We have a want<br>\
to be supplied to us on thy part; meaning we<br>\
want a thing of thee]. (S, O.)<br>\
-A3-  Also i. q.<br>\
مُدَاهَنَةٌ. (So in the O and TA. [But whether by this<br>\
explanation be meant the inf. n., or the fem. pass.<br>\
part. n., of دَاهَنَ, is not indicated. Words of the<br>\
measure فَعْلَآءُ having the meaning of an inf. n.,<br>\
like بَغْضَآءُ, are rare.])<br>\

[hobbles for a horse or the like, having a rope<br>\
extending from the shackles of the fore feet to<br>\
those of the hind feet: so accord. to present<br>\
usage; and so accord. to the TK, in Turkish<br>\
كوستك: Fei says only,] the شِكَال of the beast<br>\
(دابّة) is well known; and the pl. is as above.<br>\
(Msb.) In relation to the [camel&#39;s saddle called]<br>\
رَحْل, (K, TA,) accord. to As, (S, O, TA,) A<br>\
string, or cord, that is put [or extended and tied]<br>\
between the تَصْدِير [or fore girth] and the حَقَب<br>\
[or hind girth], (S, O, K, TA,) in order that the<br>\
latter may not become [too] near to the sheath of<br>\
the penis; also called the زِوَار, on the authority of<br>\
AA: (S, O, TA:) and [in relation to the saddle<br>\
called قَتَب,] a bond [in like manner extended and<br>\
tied, for the same purpose,] between the حَقَب [or<br>\
hind girth] and the بِطَان [by which is meant the<br>\

and a bond [probably meaning the rope men-<br>\
tioned in the explanation given from the K in the<br>\
preceding sentence] between the fore leg and the<br>\
hind leg. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, in a horse, (tropical:)  The<br>\
quality of having three legs distinguished by [the<br>\
whiteness of the lower parts which is termed]<br>\
تَحْجِيل, and one leg free therefrom; (S, O, K,<br>\
TA;) [this whiteness] being likened to the عِقَال<br>\
termed شِكَال: (S, O:) or having three legs free<br>\
from تَحْجِيل, and one hind leg distinguished<br>\
thereby: (S, O, K, * TA: *) accord. to A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
it is only in the hind leg; not in the fore leg: (S,<br>\
O:) or, accord. to AO, (TA,) having the whiteness of the تَحْجِيل in one hind leg and fore leg,<br>\
on the opposite sides, (Mgh, * TA,) whether the<br>\
whiteness be little or much: (TA:) [when this is<br>\
the case, the horse is said to be ذُو شِكَالٍ مِنْ خِلَافٍ:<br>\
see 3 (last sentence) in art. خلف:] the Prophet<br>\
disliked what is thus termed in horses. (O.)<br>\
