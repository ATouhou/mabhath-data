شَاخَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor. يَشِيخُ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. شَيَخٌ, with fet-h to the ى, (S, K,) and<br>\
شُيُوخَةٌ (K) and شِيُوخَةٌ (TA) and شُيُوخِيَّةٌ (K) and<br>\
شِيُوخِيَّةٌ (Zbd, TA) and شَيْخُوخَةٌ [the most common form, respecting which see what follows,]<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K) and شَيْخُوخِيَّةٌ; (K;) and ↓ شيّخ,<br>\
inf. n. تَشْيِيخٌ; (S, A, K;) and ↓ تشيّخ; (K;) He<br>\
became a شَيْخ [i. e. an old, or elderly, man;<br>\
&amp;c.]: (S, A, Msb, K:) in شَيْخُوخَةٌ, the ى is<br>\
originally movent [with fet-h], and afterwards<br>\
made quiescent, for there is not in the language<br>\
a word of the measure فَعْلُولٌ [except صَعْفُوقٌ, as<br>\
is said in the S in art. حيد]: as to the similar<br>\
words whose medial radical letter is و, as كَيْنُونَةٌ<br>\
and قَيْدُودَةٌ and دَيْمُومَةٌ and هَيْعُوعَةٌ, these are<br>\
originally كَيَّنُونَةٌ [for كَيْوَنُونَةٌ, of the measure<br>\
فَيْعَلُولَةٌ,] and the like, and are contracted; for<br>\
were it not so, they would be كَوْنُونَةٌ and the<br>\
like. (S, L.)<br>\
2<br>\
شيّخ: see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  شيّخهُ,<br>\
(S, K,) inf. n. تَشْيِيخٌ, (TA,) He called him by<br>\
the appellation of شَيْخ, to pay him honour, or<br>\
respect. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And شيّخ عَلَيْهِ He attributed or imputed to him, or charged him with,<br>\
a vice, or fault; blamed, or reproached, him;<br>\
(K, TA;) cast a bad, an evil, a foul, or an excessively bad or evil or foul, imputation upon him.<br>\
(TA.) And شيّخ بِهِ [and so شيّخهُ accord. to an<br>\
explanation of شَيَّخْتُ الرجل, as on the authority<br>\
of AZ, in the TA, but this may be a mistranscription for شيّخت بِالرَّجُلِ,] He exposed his vices,<br>\
faults, or evil actions; disgraced him; or put<br>\
him to shame. (K, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تشيّخ: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  [It signifies also] He feigned,<br>\
or made a show of, old age. (KL.)<br>\
شَيْخٌ (S, A, Mgh, L, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ شَيْخُونٌ,<br>\
(K,) but the latter is a strange word, mentioned<br>\
by some of the expositors of the Fs, as expressing<br>\
more than the former word, (MF,) [An old, or<br>\
elderly, man; an elder, as meaning a man whose<br>\
age gives him a claim to reverence or respect; a<br>\
senior;] one advanced in age, (Mgh,) such as is<br>\
beyond him who is termed كَهْلٌ, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
which means him whose شَبَاب [i. e. youthfulness,<br>\
or prime of manhood,] is ended: (Mgh:) one in<br>\
whom age has become apparent, (L, K,) and<br>\
hoariness: (L:) or a man from the age of fifty,<br>\
or fifty-one, to the end of his life, or to the age of<br>\
eighty: (L, K:) also expl. as meaning a man<br>\
advanced in age but having strength, or vigour,<br>\
to fight: and an old and weak, or a decrepit,<br>\
man, who is of no service: (Mgh:) [in the present<br>\
day, شَيْخٌ is used in the senses above mentioned;<br>\
and is also especially applied, as an appellation of<br>\
honour, to a doctor of religion and law; a head,<br>\
or chief, of a religious confraternity; a chief of a<br>\
tribe or the like, and of a village; and to a reputed saint:] fem. ↓ شَيْخَةٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) an<br>\
old, or aged, woman; syn. عَجُوزٌ: (A:) [and<br>\
applied in the present day particularly to a learned<br>\
woman; an instructress; and the like:] the pl. [of<br>\
pauc.] of شَيْخٌ is أَشْيَاخٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and<br>\
شِيخَةٌ (Kr, ISd, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and [of mult.]<br>\
شُيُوخٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and شِيُوخٌ (K, with<br>\
kesr, to agree with the ى, TA) and شِيخَانٌ (S,<br>\
A, Msb, K) and شِيَخَةٌ (S, Mgh, K) and شَيَخَةٌ<br>\
(A [there said to be like عَبَدَةٌ]) and ↓ مَشْيَخَةٌ, (K,<br>\
and so in one of my copies of the S,) or this last<br>\
is a quasi-pl. n., (Mgh, Msb,) and [so are]<br>\
↓ مِشْيَخَةٌ and ↓ مَشْيُخَةٌ and ↓ مِشْيُخَةٌ (TA) and<br>\
↓ مَشِيخَةٌ (K, and so in one of my copies of the<br>\
S,) and ↓ مَشْيُوخَآءُ, (S, K,) the last like مَشْيُوحَآءُ<br>\
and مَعْلُوجَآءُ and مَسْلُومَآءُ and مَعْبُودَآءُ and مَعْيُورَآءُ,<br>\
which are said to be the only other instances of<br>\
this form, (TA,) [but to these should be added<br>\
مَحْمُورَآءُ and مَكْبُورَآءُ and مَتْيُوسَآءُ and perhaps<br>\
some other instances,] and ↓ مَشْيُخَآءُ, (K,) and<br>\
another pl. is ↓ مَشَايِخُ, (S, A, K,) or this last is<br>\
pl. of مَشْيَخَةٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) and is disallowed by<br>\
IDrd and Kz (TA) [though very commonly used<br>\
in the present day, especially as applied to doctors<br>\
of religion and law]; and the pl. of أَشْيَاخٌ is<br>\
أَشَايِيخُ, like أَنَايِيبُ pl. of أَنْيَابٌ: (Z, TA:) the<br>\
dim. of شَيْخٌ is ↓ شُيَيْخٌ (S, A, K) and ↓ شِيَيْخٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) with kesr to the ش: (S:) ↓ شُوَيْخٌ is not<br>\
allowable, (S, A,) or is rare. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [الشَّيْخَانِ,<br>\
The two Sheykhs, is a title peculiarly applied to<br>\
the first two Khaleefehs, Aboo-Bekr and &#39;Omar.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  شَيْخٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A woman&#39;s husband, (K,)<br>\
though young: and in like manner, a man&#39;s wife,<br>\
whether old or young, is called his عَجُوز. (Az,<br>\
TA in art. عجز.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And (tropical:)  An ancestor. Accord. to a copy of the A that seems to have been<br>\
used by the author of the TA, one says, وَرِثَ مِنْ<br>\
مَشِيخَةِ الكَرَم and من أَشْيَاخِهِ, which is tropical,<br>\
meaning مِنْ آبَائِهِ: but the right reading is evidently ↓ من مَشِيخَتِهِ, and الكَرَمَ; and the meaning,<br>\
(tropical:)  He inherited, from his ancestors, generosity.] ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
شَيْخُ النَّارِ means (tropical:)  Iblees: because he was created<br>\
of fire, or because his ultimate place will be the<br>\
fire of Hell. (Har p. 130.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And الشَّيْخُ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
mountain-goat that is advanced in age, or fullgrown. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And (assumed tropical:)  The milk-skin. (TA.)<br>\

-b8-  أَشْيَاخُ النُّجُومِ i. q. أُصُولُهَا, (K,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
seven [or five] planets; (TK;) or the دَرَارِىْء [also<br>\
applied by some to the five planets, Mercury,<br>\
Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn]; accord. to<br>\
IAar, اشياخ النجوم, (TA in this art.,) or أَسْنَاخُ<br>\
النُّجُومِ as is related by Th, (TA in art. سنخ,)<br>\
means the stars that do not make their [temporary] abode in the Mansions of the Moon, which<br>\
[latter] are called نُجُومُ الأَخْذِ: ISd says, I think<br>\
that he means, by the نجوم, the fixed stars: Th<br>\
says that they are called only أَسْنَاخُ النُّجُومِ, i. e.<br>\
the أُصُول thereof, around which the [other] stars<br>\
revolve, and pursue their courses. (TA. [See<br>\
also سِنْخٌ, last sentence.])<br>\
-A2-  شَيْخٌ signifies also<br>\
A certain tree; (AZ, K, TA;) also called شَجَرَةُ<br>\
الشُّيُوخِ, the fruit of which is a جِرْو [q. v.] like<br>\
that of the خِرِّيع, which is the bastard saffron<br>\
(شَجَرَةُ العُصْفُرِ); it grows in the meadows, and<br>\
the قُرْيَان [or places where water runs to, or in,<br>\
or into, meadows, &amp;c.]. (AZ, TA.)<br>\
