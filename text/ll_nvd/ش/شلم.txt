شَيْلَمٌ The رُؤَان [now applied to darnel-grass<br>\
(but see this latter word زؤان)] that is [often<br>\
found] in wheat; also called ↓ شَالَمٌ (Msb, K) and<br>\
↓ شَوْلَمٌ; (K;) of Pers., or foreign, origin; (أَصْلُهُ<br>\
أَعْجَمِىٌّ;) and it is said that one of its two extremities is sharp and the other thick: (Msb:)<br>\

زِيوَان [sic.] and سَعِيع: AHn says that it is a<br>\
small, oblong, red, erect grain, resembling in form<br>\
the سُوس [or grub] of wheat; and it does not<br>\
intoxicate, but renders the wheat very bitter: and<br>\
in one place he says, the plant of the شيلم spreads<br>\
upon the ground, and its leaves are like those of<br>\
the خِلَاف [or salix Aegyptia] that is termed<br>\
بَلْخِىّ, very green, and juicy, or tender; people eat<br>\
its leaves when they are fresh, and they are<br>\
pleasant [to the taste], without bitterness; but its<br>\
grain is more intensely, or nauseously, bitter<br>\
(أَعْقَى) than aloes. (TA.) [Forskål, in his Flora<br>\
Aegypt. Arab. p. 199, after describing the زؤان,<br>\
says, “شيلم etiam agri vitium; a priore tamen<br>\
diversa species: decocto plantæ obtunduntur sensus<br>\
hominis qui operationem chirurgicam subire<br>\
debet; Avicenna sic referente. ” See also سَكَرَةٌ.]<br>\
