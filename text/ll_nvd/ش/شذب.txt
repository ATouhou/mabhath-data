the pass. part. n.]. ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  Tall; (S, A;) as also<br>\
↓ شَوْذَبٌ; (S;) the former as an epithet applied to<br>\
a horse, (S, A,) from the same epithet as applied<br>\
to a palm-trunk: (A:) and (assumed tropical:)  tall, and goodly in<br>\

to anything [meaning any animal], (assumed tropical:)  tall, and excellent or of high breed or strong and light and<br>\
swift: A &#39;Obeyd says that the former signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  excessively tall, and is applied in this sense to<br>\
anything [i. e. a man and any animal]: Kt says,<br>\
after explaining شَذَّبْتُ المَالَ as it has been expl.<br>\
above, that he who is excessively tall is as though<br>\
his frame were disconnected, and not compact;<br>\
and therefore he is thus termed: but IAmb says<br>\
that Kt has made a mistake in asserting that this<br>\
epithet signifies (assumed tropical:)  tall, conspicuous for tallness,<br>\
and that it is from the palm-tree from which the<br>\
branches have been lopped off, (in consequence of<br>\
which, as is said in the Fáïk, it becomes taller,<br>\
MF, TA,) and that he who is (assumed tropical:)  conspicuous for<br>\
tallness is not thus called unless somewhat deficient in flesh: it is applied to a horse as meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  tall, and not very fleshy. (TA.)<br>\
