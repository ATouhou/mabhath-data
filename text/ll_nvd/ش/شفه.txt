شَفَهَهُ, aor.<br>\
شَفَهَ, (K,) inf. n. شَفْهٌ, (TK,) He<br>\
struck his شَفَة [i. e. lip]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شُفِهَ, [said of<br>\
a water, (assumed tropical:)  It had many lips of drinkers applied<br>\
to it; i. e. it had many drinkers: (see its part. n.:)<br>\
and] said of food, (tropical:)  It had many eaters: (K, TA:)<br>\
or [as a consequence thereof] it became little in<br>\
quantity. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence], said of property,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  It had many seekers. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And, said of a<br>\
man, (assumed tropical:)  He had many askers, or beggars, (K,<br>\
TA,) so that they consumed what he had, or<br>\
possessed. (TA.) [Or (assumed tropical:)  He was importuned by<br>\
begging, so that what he had, or possessed, was<br>\
consumed: as pass. of what next follows.] ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
شَفَهَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He importuned him by begging, so that he<br>\
consumed what he had, or possessed. (S, K.)<br>\
And one says, كَادَ العِيَالُ يَشْفَهُونَ مَالِى (tropical:)  The<br>\
family, or household, almost consumed my property. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also, (S, K,) inf. n. شَفْهٌ,<br>\
(S,) i. q. شَغَلَ. (S, K.) You say, شَفَهَنِى عَنْ كَذَا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He, or it, occupied me so as to divert me from<br>\
such a thing; syn. شَغَلَنِى. (S.) And نَحْنُ<br>\
نَشْفَهُ عَلَيْكَ المَرْتَعَ, and المَآءَ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  We<br>\
occupy the place of pasturage so as to keep it<br>\
from thee, and the water, (نَشْغَلُهُ عَنْكَ,) i. e. it is<br>\
sufficient for us without being more than sufficient.<br>\
(S, TA.) And شُفِهَ عَنْكَ مَا عِنْدَنَا (assumed tropical:)  What we<br>\
had was employed so as to be kept from thee;<br>\
syn. شُغِلَ عَنْكَ. (JK.)<br>\
-A2-  IAar mentions the<br>\
phrase شَفَهْتُ نَصِيبِى, with fet-h, without explaining it; but Th says that it is سفهت, [i. e.<br>\
سَفِهْتُ, with س, and with kesr to the ف,] meaning<br>\
“ I forgot [my share, or portion]. ” (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
شافههُ, (K,) inf. n. مُشَافَهَةٌ, (TA,) He put<br>\
his lip (شَفَتَهُ) near to his [another&#39;s] lip. (K,<br>\
TA.) And كَلَّمَهُ مُشَافَهَةً (Msb, TA) and مُشَافَاةً<br>\
(Msb) He spoke to him putting his lip near to<br>\
his lip: (TA:) [or mouth to mouth; for,] accord.<br>\
to J, (TA,) مُشَافَهَةٌ signifies the talking with<br>\
another mouth to mouth: (S, TA:) but the usage<br>\
of the inf. n. of a verb different from that which<br>\
it is thus made to qualify is, as Sb says, restricted to instances that have been heard: the<br>\
phrase كَلَّمَهُ مُفَاوَهَةً [has not been heard, and<br>\
therefore] is not allowable. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
شافه البَلَدَ, and الأَمْرَ, (tropical:)  He was, or became, or<br>\
drew, near to the town, or country, and the affair.<br>\
(A, K, TA.)<br>\
شَفَةٌ, (T, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) also pronounced<br>\
↓ شِفَةٌ, (K,) is a word of which the third, i. e. the<br>\
final, radical letter is elided; (T, Msb;) and<br>\
accord. to some, (Msb,) this letter is ه, (T, Msb,<br>\
K, TA,) so accord. to all of the Basrees, (TA,)<br>\
the word being originally ↓ شفهة, (T, S, Msb, TA,)<br>\
i. e. شَفَهَةٌ, (so in copies of the S,) or شَفْهَةٌ, like<br>\
كَلْبَهٌ and سَجْدَةٌ, (Msb,) because it has the<br>\
former of the dims. mentioned below, and the<br>\
first of the pls. mentioned below, with ه, (S,<br>\
Msb, *) and it is sometimes pronounced شفهة;<br>\
(T, TA;) or, as some assert, the deficient letter is<br>\
و, (S, Msb,) the word being originally شَفْوَةٌ, like<br>\
شَهْوَةٌ, (Msb,) because it has the last of the pls.<br>\
mentioned below, (S, [but omitted in one of my<br>\
copies,] and Msb, *) and the latter of the two<br>\
dims. mentioned below; (Msb;) both of which<br>\
assertions are stated on the authority of Kh; (IF,<br>\
Msb;) [The lip of a human being;] شَفَتَا الإِنْسَانِ<br>\
meaning the two covers of the mouth of the<br>\
human being: (K:) it is [properly] only of a<br>\
human being: (Msb:) but it is sometimes, metaphorically, of the horse: and in like manner, of<br>\
the دَلْو [or leathern bucket] as used by A&#39;Obeyd;<br>\
but ISd has expressed a doubt whether he had<br>\
heard this from the Arabs: (TA:) the pl. is شِفَاهٌ<br>\
(S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and شَفَهَاتٌ (Lth, Msb, TA) and<br>\
شَفَوَاتٌ, (Lth, S, Msb, K,) the second of which is<br>\
said by Lth to be more agreeable with analogy<br>\
than the third, though the third is more common,<br>\
as being likened to سَنَوَاتٌ [pl. of سَنَةٌ]: (Az,<br>\
(Msb, TA:) and Ks mentions the phrase, إِنَّهُ<br>\
لَغَلِيظُ الشِفَاهِ [as meaning Verily he is thick in the<br>\
lip], as though the term شَفَةٌ applied to every<br>\
portion of the شَفَة: (TA:) the dim. is ↓ شُفَيْهَةُ<br>\
(S, Msb) and شُفَيَّةٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] هُمْ أَهْلُ<br>\
الشَّفَةِ (assumed tropical:)  They are those who have the right of<br>\
drinking with their lips (بِشِفَاهِهِمْ) and of watering<br>\
their beasts. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And بِنْتُ شَفَةٍ (tropical:)  A word;<br>\
(S, Msb, K, TA;) as also ذَاتُ شَفَةٍ. (TA.) One<br>\
says, مَا كَلَّمْتُهُ بِبِنْتِ شَفَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  I spoke not to him a<br>\
word: (S:) or مَا كَلَّمَنِىبِنْتَ شَفَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  He spoke<br>\
not to me a word: (TA:) and مَا سَمِعْتُ مِنْهُ بِنْتَ شَفَةٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I heard not from him a word: (Msb:) and<br>\
مَا كَلَّمْتُ فُلَانًا ذَاتَ شَفَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  I spoke not to such<br>\
a one a word. (AZ, T voce ذُو.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And فُلَانٌ<br>\
خَفِيفُ الشَّفَةِ (tropical:)  Such a one is a person who asks, or<br>\
begs, little of people: (ISk, S, K, * TA:) and also,<br>\
(tropical:)  importunate, (K, TA,) one who asks, or begs,<br>\
much of people: (TA:) thus having two contr.<br>\
meanings. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And لَهُ فِى النَّاسِ شَفَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
has praise, or commendation, among the people:<br>\
(S:) and لَهُ فِينَا شَفَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ (tropical:)  He has a good report,<br>\
or reputation, among us. (A, K, TA.) And<br>\
إِنَّ شَفَةَ النَّاسِ عَلَيْكَ لَحَسَنَةٌ (tropical:)  Verily the people&#39;s<br>\
speaking of thee is good. (Lh, TA.) And مَا<br>\
أَحْسَنَ شَفَةَ النَّاسِ عَلَيْكَ (tropical:)  How good is the people&#39;s<br>\
speaking of thee! (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See also شَفًا, in<br>\
art. شفو and شفى.<br>\
شِفَةٌ, and see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
شَفَهَةٌ or شَفْهَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
شَفَهِىٌّ and شَفِىٌّ are both allowable as rel. ns. of<br>\
شَفَةٌ [i. e. as meaning Labial: and so, accord. to<br>\
some, is شَفَوِىٌّ]. (S.) الحُرُوفُ الشَّفَهِيَّةُ (Kh, T,<br>\
S, Msb, K) and الشَّفَوِيَّةُ, (Kh, T, Msb,) or the<br>\
latter is not allowable, (S,) [i. e. The labial<br>\
letters,] are ب and ف and م: (T, S, K:) [or,<br>\
accord. to Lumsden (Ar. Gr. p. 28), ب and م<br>\
and و: and, it seems, accord. to some, (see De<br>\
Sacy&#39;s Gr. Ar. sec. ed. i. 27,) ج and ش and ض,<br>\
which is strange:] so called because their place of<br>\
utterance is from the شَفَة, without any action of<br>\
the tongue. (T, TA.)<br>\
شُفَيْهَةٌ: dim. of شَفَةٌ, q. v.<br>\
شُفَاهِىٌّ A man (S, Mgh) large [in some copies<br>\
of the S thick] in the شَفَتَانِ [or lips]; (S, Mgh,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ أَشْفَهُ. (Mgh. [But see this latter<br>\
below.])<br>\
شَافِهٌ Thirsty, (K, TA,) not finding water<br>\
enough to moisten his lip: like سَافِهٌ, mentioned in<br>\
art. سفه. (TA.)<br>\
أَشْفَهُ: see شُفَاهِىٌّ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Accord. to some,] أَشْفَى<br>\
signifies A man whose lips do not close together:<br>\
(S, K:) but there is no proof of its correctness:<br>\
(S:) the fem. in this sense is شَفْيَآءُ. (TA in art.<br>\
شفى.)<br>\
مَشْفُوهٌ (tropical:)  A water at which there are many lips<br>\
(شِفَاه TA, and Har p. 669,) of those coming to<br>\
drink, (Har,) so that it has become little in quantity; (TA;) or water at which are many people:<br>\
(S, K: *) or water that is sought: or, as some say,<br>\
forbidden to those who come to drink of it because<br>\
of its being little in quantity. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
hence, (Har ubi suprà,) (tropical:)  Food upon which are<br>\
[put] many hands; (K, TA, Har;) having many<br>\
eaters: or that has become little in quantity.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  Property sought by many: (TA:)<br>\
[or little in quantity; for] one says, أَتَانَا وَ أَمْوَالُنَا<br>\
مَشْفُوهَةٌ (tropical:)  He came to us when our possessions<br>\
were little in quantity. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
man of whom people have asked, or begged, much,<br>\
(S,) or importuned by begging, (K,) so that all<br>\
that he had, or possessed, is consumed: (S, K:)<br>\
like مَثْمُودٌ, and مَضْفُوفٌ, and مَكْثُورٌ عَلَيْهِ: (so in<br>\
one of my copies of the S:) and sometimes it<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  one whose household and guests have<br>\
consumed his property. (IB, TA.)<br>\
شفو and شفى<br>\
1<br>\
شَفَتِ الشَّمْسُ, aor.<br>\
1َ2ُ3َ, [inf. n. app. شَفًا, but<br>\
said in the TK to be شَفْوٌ,] The sun was, or became, near to setting: (K in art. شفو:) and<br>\
شَفَت, (K in art. شفى,) [aor.<br>\
1َ2ِ3َ,] inf. n. شَفًا,<br>\
(TA,) it (the sun) set; as also شَفِيَت: (K:) or,<br>\
accord. to IKtt, set save a little; and the like is<br>\
said in the T. (TA.) قُبَيْلَ الشَّفَا means A little<br>\
before the setting of the sun. (TA.) [See also<br>\
شَفًا below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And شَفَا said of the هِلَال [or<br>\
moon a little after or before the change], It rose.<br>\
(K.) And said of a شَخْص [or bodily form or<br>\
figure seen from a distance, or a person], It,<br>\
or he, appeared, or became apparent. (K.)<br>\

1َ2ِ3َ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
شِفَآءٌ, (S, Msb,) He (God, S, Msb) recovered<br>\
him, or restored him to convalescence, syn.<br>\
أَبْرَأَهُ, so in the M, but in the K بَرَاهُ, (TA,)<br>\
namely a sick person, (Msb,) مِنْ مَرَضِهِ [from<br>\
his disease, or sickness]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,<br>\
شَفَيْتُهُ, in art. بضع in the S, said by a person<br>\
respecting one who asked him concerning a<br>\
question, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  I relieved him from doubt:<br>\
and شَفَاهُ عَنِ المَسْأَلَةِ in the same art. in the K, as<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He relieved him from doubt respecting<br>\
the question. See 8 as quasi-pass. of the verb<br>\
thus used.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And يَشْفِيكَ إِنْ قَالَ (assumed tropical:)  [He will<br>\
please thee if he speak; i. e.] his speech will please<br>\
thee. (Har p. 433.) ―<br>\
-b4-  شَفَاهُ also signifies He<br>\
sought, or demanded, or desired, for him, recovery, or restoration to convalescence; and so<br>\
↓ أَشْفَاهُ: (K, TA:) thus in the M. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
شفّاهُ بِكُلِ شَىْءٍ, inf. n. تَشْفِيَةٌ, He treated<br>\
him medically, or curatively, with everything<br>\
whereby he might attain recovery, or restoration<br>\
to convalescence. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَا شَفَّى فُلَانٌ أَفْضَلُ<br>\
مِمَّا شَفَّيْتَ i. e. مَا ازْدَادَ and رَبِحَ [meaning The<br>\
gain of such a one (ما being here what is termed<br>\
مَصْدَرِيَّة, as اِزْدَادَ and رَبِحَ are intrans.,) is more<br>\
excellent than thy gain] is said to be an instance<br>\
of substitution, [originally شَفَّفَ and شَفَّفْتَ,] like<br>\
[قَصَّى and تَقَصَّى and] تَقَضَّى [for قَصَّصَ and<br>\
تَقَصَّصَ and تَقَضَّضَ]. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
مُشَافَاةٌ [an inf. n. of which the verb, if used,<br>\
is شَافَى]: see 3 in art. شفه.<br>\
4<br>\
اشفى عَلَيْهِ He was, or became, on the brink<br>\
of it; (S, Msb, K, TA;) namely, a thing; and<br>\
death: (S, Msb:) mostly used in relation to evil,<br>\
but also in relation to good: so says IKtt. (TA.)<br>\
[See شَفًا.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And اشفى [alone] (assumed tropical:)  He was, or<br>\
became, at the point of [giving or receiving] a<br>\
charge or an injunction, or a trust or deposit.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, in the last<br>\
part of the night; which is termed شَفَا اللَّيْلِ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  أَشْفَى نَفْسَهُ عَلَى هُلْكٍ (K and TA in<br>\
art. خطر) and اشفى بِهَا (TA in the same) i. e.<br>\
عَلَى شَفَا هُلْكٍ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  He caused himself to<br>\
be on the brink of destruction]. (TA ibid.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
اشفاهُ He gave him a remedial medicine. (Az,<br>\
TA.) And He prescribed for him a remedy in<br>\
which should be his recovery, or restoration to<br>\
convalescence. (TA.) And أَشْفَيْتُكَ الشَّىْءَ (S, K *)<br>\
I gave thee the thing in order that thou shouldst<br>\
attain, or seek, recovery, or restoration to convalescence, thereby. (S: in two copies thereof,<br>\
بِهِ ↓ تَشْتَفِى: in two other copies thereof, and in<br>\
like manner in the K, بِهِ ↓ تَسْتَشْفِى.) And اشفاهُ<br>\
اللّٰهُ عَسَلًا God made honey to be his remedy.<br>\
(AO, S: and the like is said by IKtt as cited in<br>\
the TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b3-  اشفى<br>\
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He gave [a person] something.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تشفّى: see 8 [with which it is syn.]. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] تشفّى مِنْ غَيْظِهِ (S, MA, K) (assumed tropical:)  He recovered from his anger, wrath, or rage. (MA.)<br>\
And تشفّى مِنْ عَدُوِّهِ, (T, TA,) or بِالعَدُوِّ, and<br>\
به ↓ اشتفى, (Msb,) (assumed tropical:)  He inflicted injury upon<br>\
his enemy [or the enemy] in a manner that rejoiced him [or relieved him from his anger]: (T,<br>\
TA:) [or he attained what he desired from his<br>\
enemy or the enemy, and so appeased his anger:]<br>\
because latent anger is like a disease; and when<br>\
it departs by reason of that which one seeks to<br>\
obtain from his enemy, he is as though he became<br>\
free, or recovered, from his disease. (Msb.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَشَافَيْتُ المَآءَ a phrase mentioned by IAar as<br>\
meaning I exhausted the water: said by ISd to<br>\
be originally تَشَافَفْتُ. (TA in art. شف.)<br>\
8<br>\
اشتفى بِكَذَا (S, K, TA) He attained recovery, or restoration to convalescence, by means<br>\
of such a thing: (TA;) and so ↓ تشفّى: (TK:)<br>\
and مِنْ عِلَّتِهِ ↓ استشفى [if not a mistranscription<br>\
for اشتفى] he became free from his disease, sickness, or malady; recovered from it; or became<br>\
convalescent. (TA.) See 4, latter part. ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
see also 5. ―<br>\
-b3-  [Also (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, content<br>\
with such a thing; or relieved from doubt thereby:<br>\
and] (assumed tropical:)  he profited by such a thing. (MA.) One<br>\
says, اِشْتَفَيْتُ بِمَا أَخْبَرَنِى فُلَانٌ (assumed tropical:)  I was, or became, content with that which such a one told me,<br>\
[or relieved from doubt thereby,] because it was<br>\
true. (IB in art. حك, from Az.) And أَخْبَرَهُ<br>\
فُلَانٌ فَاشْتَفَى بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one gave him information] and he profited by his veracity. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استشفى He sought, or demanded, a remedy,<br>\
or cure. (TA.) See 4, latter part. ―<br>\
-b2-  And see<br>\
also 8.<br>\
شَفًا The point or extremity, verge, brink, or<br>\
edge, of anything; (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.;) like ↓ شَفَةٌ;<br>\
for شَفَا الحُفْرَةِ (Ksh in iii. 99) or شَفَا البِئْرِ (Bd<br>\
ibid.) and شَفَتُهَا both signify the same, (Ksh, Bd,)<br>\
i. e. حَرْفُهَا (Ksh) or طَرَفُهَا; (Bd;) but the final و<br>\
in the former is changed into ا, and in the latter<br>\
[accord. to those who hold شَفَةٌ to be originally<br>\
شَفْوَةٌ] it is elided; (Ksh, Bd;) شَفًا being originally<br>\
شَفَوٌ: (Bd:) [but شَفًا generally signifies as expl.<br>\
above; and شَفَةٌ almost always signifies the “ lip ”<br>\
of a human being:] the dual is شَفَوَانِ; this being<br>\
known, as Akh says, by the fact that إِمَالَة in the<br>\
word شَفًا is not allowable: (S:) and the pl. is<br>\
أَشْفَآءٌ. (TA.) It is said in the Kur [iii. 99],<br>\
وَكُنْتُمْ عَلَى شَفَا حُفْرَةٌ مِنَ النَّارِ فَأَنْقَذَكُمْ مِنْهَا [And<br>\
ye were on the verge, or brink, of a pit of the fire<br>\
of Hell, and He saved, or rescued, you from it].<br>\
(S.) And one says, هُوَ عَلَى شَفَا الهَلَاكِ (tropical:)  [He is<br>\
on the brink of destruction]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  A<br>\
little; (S, A, K, TA;) a small part, or portion;<br>\
somewhat; (A, TA;) somewhat remaining of the<br>\
moon when near the change, (K, TA, [الهَلاك in<br>\
the CK is erroneously put for الهِلَال,]) and of the<br>\
sight (البَصَر), and of the day, and the like, as in<br>\
the T. (TA.) One says of a man on the occasion of<br>\
his dying, and of the moon at [the last period of the<br>\
month called] its مُحَاق, and of the sun at its<br>\
setting, (S,) مَا بَقِىَ مِنْهُ إِلَّا شَفًا [and مِنْهَا when<br>\
said of the sun] (assumed tropical:)  There has not remained of him,<br>\
or it, save a little: (S, K: *) and [in like manner]<br>\
مِنَ العُمُرِ [of life]. (S.) And one says, أَتَيْتُهُ<br>\
بِشَفًا مِنْ ضَوْءِ الشَّمْسِ (assumed tropical:)  [I came to him in a time<br>\
when there was little remaining of the light of the<br>\
sun]. (TA.) El-&#39;Ajjáj says,<br>\
أَشْرَفْتُهُ بِلَا شَفًا أَوْ بِشَفَا  وَمِرْبَأٍ عَالٍ لِمَنٌ تَشَرَّفَا<br>\
meaning [Many an elevated place of observation,<br>\
high to him who ascends it, I have ascended]<br>\
when the sun had set or when there was somewhat<br>\
of it remaining. (S.) One says also, صَارَ فِى شَفَا<br>\
القَمَرِ meaning (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, in the last<br>\
part of the night. (TA.) And it is said in a trad.,<br>\
(in relation to [the temporary marriage termed]<br>\
المُتْعَة,) فَلَوْ لَا نَهْيُهُ عَنْهَا مَا احْتَاجَ إِلَى الزِّنَا إِلَّا شَفًا,<br>\
accord. to the T meaning [Were it not for his<br>\
(i. e. God&#39;s) forbidding it, none would need having<br>\
recourse to fornication,] save a small number of<br>\
men: (T, TA:) or, accord. to &#39;Atà, it means, but<br>\
would be on the brink thereof, without falling<br>\
into it; شَفًا being thus used in the place of the<br>\
inf. n. إِشْفَآء: so says IAth, as from Az. (TA.)<br>\
شَفَةٌ, in which the deficient letter is و, (K, TA,)<br>\
for it has for pl. شَفَوَاتٌ, (TA,) or ه, (K, TA,)<br>\
for it has [also] for pl. شِفَاهٌ, (TA,) has been<br>\
mentioned before, (K, TA,) in art. شفه [q. v.].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also شَفًا above, first sentence.<br>\
شِفَآءٌ, (K, TA,) like كِسَآءٌ, (TA,) [in the CK<br>\
erroneously written شَفاء,] primarily signifies The<br>\
becoming free from disease, sickness, or malady;<br>\
recovering therefrom; or becoming convalescent:<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  and then, Medical, or curative, treatment:<br>\
(TA:) the giving of health; (KL:) inf. n. of شَفَاهُ<br>\
[q. v.]: (S, Msb, TA:) ―<br>\
-b3-  and [then], (TA,) A<br>\
medicine, or remedy: pl. أَشْفِيَةٌ, and pl. pl. أَشَافٍ.<br>\
(K, TA.) [Hence, دَارُ الشِفَآءِ The hospital.] ―<br>\
