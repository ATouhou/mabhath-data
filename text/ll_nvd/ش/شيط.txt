blood, (S,) or it, (his blood,) (Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\

the expression لَوْ تُشَاطُ دِمَاؤُنَا [If our bloods were<br>\
mixed]; (S, TA;) accord. to one relation; but<br>\

latter also signifies He burned its wool, namely,<br>\
that of a sheep, in order to cleanse it; and so<br>\
شوّطهُ: (S, TA:) and each of these, he (a cook)<br>\
set it on fire, namely the foot of a bull or cow, or<br>\

he laboured to destroy him, or to kill him: (K,<br>\

استشاط (tropical:)  He became inflamed by anger;<br>\
عَلَيْهِ against him: (K, TA:) or he became as<br>\
though he were inflamed in his anger; accord. to<br>\
As, from مِشْيَاطٌ as applied to a she-camel: (S,<br>\
TA:) [or] he burned, and became inflamed, by<br>\
vehement anger. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  He (a man, TA)<br>\

fat: (S, TA:) [as though he desired, or demanded,<br>\
that he should be slaughtered, and that his flesh<br>\

شَيْطَان [i. e. شَيْطَانٌ or شَيْطَانُ, accord. to different authorities, as shown below, A devil; and<br>\
with the article ال, the devil, Satan;] is, accord.<br>\
to some, from شَاطَ, (Msb, K, TA,) as signifying<br>\
“ it was, or became, null, void, of no account; ”<br>\
and the like: (Msb, TA:) or “ he perished: ”<br>\
(K, TA:) or “ he went away: ” or “ it burned,”<br>\
or “ became burnt: ” two reasons given for this<br>\
derivation are, that among the names of the devil<br>\
are المُذْهَبُ and البَاطِلُ: and another is this; that<br>\
several read, in the Kur xxvi. 210, الشَّيَاطُونَ<br>\
[instead of الشَّيَاطِينُ]: but some say that it is from<br>\
شَطَنَ, signifying “ he became distant,” or “ remote: ” Sb gives both of these derivations:<br>\
respecting the former of which, it should be observed that if from شاط as signifying “ it burned,”<br>\
or “ became burnt,” it is proper; but if from the<br>\
same in any of the other senses mentioned above,<br>\
it is tropical: and if belonging to this art., it is<br>\
imperfectly decl., being of the measure فَعْلَان:<br>\
(S in art. شطن, in which see it:) [but in the<br>\
Kur-án it is always perfectly decl.: and SM says<br>\
that] it is perfectly decl., unless used as a proper<br>\
name; in the latter case being imperfectly decl.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
شِيَاطٌ The smell of a piece of cotton burning, or<br>\
burnt. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also مِشْيَاطٌ.<br>\
شَائِطٌ and شَاطٍ, like هَائِرٌ and هَارٍ, [the latter being<br>\
formed by transposition from the former, شَاطٍ and<br>\
هَارٍ being for شَاطِىٌ and هَارِىٌ,] Flesh-meat [&amp;c.]<br>\
burning, or being burnt. (TA.)<br>\
تَشْيِيطٌ Flesh-meat roasted, (K,) or made good,<br>\
and roasted, (TA,) for a company of men: (K:)<br>\
a subst., like تَمْتِينٌ. (K, TA.) [In the CK, for<br>\
اِسْمٌ كَالتَّمْتِينِ, we find واسمٌ كالتَّمْتِينِ.]<br>\
مِشْيَاطٌ (tropical:)  A she-camel that quickly becomes fat:<br>\
(As, S, A, K:) applied also to a he-camel: (TA:)<br>\
pl. مَشَايِيطُ; (S, K;) in some of the copies of the<br>\
S, مَشَايِطُ: and you say also ↓ إِبِلٌ شياط [app. a<br>\
mistake for مِشْيَاطٌ, which is fem., like إِبِلٌ, as well<br>\
as masc.]: AA says that مشايط, [or مَشَايِيطُ,]<br>\
applied to camels, signifies assigned for slaughter;<br>\
from شَاطَ said of a person&#39;s blood. (TA.)<br>\
مُسْتَشِيطٌ (tropical:)  A fat camel. (K.) [See 10.] ―<br>\
