شَهَبٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *) It (a thing, S) was,<br>\
or became, of the colour termed شُهْبَة, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
i. e. of a [gray] colour in which whiteness predominated over blackness, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or in<br>\
which whiteness was interrupted by blackness;<br>\
(K, * TA;) as also شَهُبَ, aor.<br>\

TA,) inf. n. تَشْهِيبٌ, (O,) said of cold, It altered<br>\
the colour of the trees: and النَّاسَ ↓ شهّب is likewise said of cold [as meaning It altered the colour<br>\
of the men or people]. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And شَهَبَتِ<br>\
السَّنَةُ القَوْمَ The year of drought destroyed the<br>\
cattle (أَمْوَال) of the people or party: (so accord.<br>\
to the CK and my MS. copy of the K:) or the<br>\
verb in this sense is ↓ أَشْهَبَت. (So accord. to the<br>\
text of the K as given in the TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Freytag<br>\

another meaning, belonging to 4.]<br>\

شَهَّبَ see the preceding paragraph, in three places.<br>\

اشهب, said of a stallion, He had offspring<br>\
of the colour termed شُهْبَة born to him: so accord.<br>\
to the K: but accord. to IM and the other<br>\
lexicologists, it is said of a man, meaning the<br>\
offspring of his horses were of the colour termed<br>\
شُهْبَة: IAar says that there are not, among horses,<br>\
such as are termed شُهْبٌ [pl. of أَشْهَبُ]: A&#39; Obeyd,<br>\
however, [as will be seen below,] explains شُهْبَة<br>\
as meaning a colour of horses. (TA.) ―<br>\

-A2-  And a boy, or young man, light, or<br>\
active, in body, and sharp-headed. (IAar, TA<br>\
voce عَضْبٌ. [See also شِهَابٌ.])<br>\
شَهَبٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
شُهْبَةٌ A [gray] colour in which whiteness predominates over blackness, (S, Msb,) or in which<br>\
whiteness is interrupted by blackness; as also<br>\
↓ شَهَبٌ; (A, K;) which latter is [properly] an<br>\
inf. n., of شَهِبَ: (S, Msb:) or whiteness mixed<br>\
with blackness: (Har p. 150:) not pure whiteness,<br>\
as some have imagined it to be. (TA.) And in<br>\
horses, A colour in which the main hue is interrupted by a hoariness, or by some white hairs,<br>\
whether the horse be [in his general colour]<br>\
كُمَيْت or أَشْقَر or أَدْهَم. (A&#39; Obeyd, TA.)<br>\
شَهَبَانٌ A kind of plant (شَجَرٌ), resembling the<br>\
ثُمَام [or panic grass]; (K;) like شَبَهَانٌ. (TA.<br>\
[But see this last word.])<br>\
شَهَابٌ (AHát, S, K) and ↓ شُهَابَةٌ (AHát, Kr, K)<br>\
Milk mixed with much water: (AHát, S:) or a<br>\
mixture of which one third is milk and the rest<br>\
water: (K, TA:) Az heard several of the Arabs<br>\
apply the former term to milk mixed with water:<br>\
so called on account of the alteration of its colour.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
شِهَابٌ, in its primary acceptation, A شُعْلَة [i. e.<br>\
either brand or flame (app. the former, agreeably<br>\
with what follows,)] of fire: (TA:) or a شُعْلَة<br>\
of fire gleaming or radiating: (S, K:) accord. to<br>\
ISk, a firebrand; i. e. a stick in which is fire:<br>\
or, accord. to AHeyth, originally, a piece of wood,<br>\
or stick, in which is fire gleaming or radiating:<br>\
(Az, TA:) pl. شُهُبٌ, (S, K,) and some allow شُهْبٌ,<br>\
(TA,) and شُهْبَانٌ (Akh, S, K) and شِهْبَانٌ, (K,)<br>\
which is strange, (TA,) and أَشْهُبٌ, (K,) which<br>\
last is [a pl. of pauc., but] thought by IM to be a<br>\
quasi-pl. n. (TA.) The reading بِشِهَابِ قَبَسٍ, instead<br>\
of بِشِهَابٍ قَبَسٍ, in the Kur [xxvii. 7], is an<br>\
instance of a word prefixed to another identical<br>\
therewith. (Fr. L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, [A shooting, or<br>\
falling, star;] a star, or the like of a star, that<br>\
darts down [or is hurled] by night; and particularly after a devil; as occurring in the Kur [xv.<br>\
18 and] xxxvii. 10; and in a trad.; respecting<br>\
the attempt of a devil to hear, by stealth, words<br>\
uttered in heaven. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] الشُّهُبُ<br>\
signifies The shining, or brightly-shining, stars:<br>\
(K:) or the seven stars [or planets; meaning,<br>\
not the Pleiades (which are called النَّجْمُ), but<br>\
the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars,<br>\
Jupiter, and Saturn: the first three of which are<br>\
said by Freytag to be called صِغَارُ الشُّهُبِ]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  For another meaning assigned in the K to<br>\
الشُّهُبُ, see الشُّهْبُ, voce أَشْهَبُ. ―<br>\
-b5-  شِهَابٌ also signifies (tropical:)  One who is penetrating, sharp, or energetic,<br>\
in an affair; (K, TA;) as being likened to the<br>\
[shooting] star. (TA.) One says, إِنَّ فُلَانًا لَشِهَابُ<br>\
حَرْبٍ (tropical:)  Verily such a man is one who is penetrating, sharp, or energetic, in war. (S, A. *) And<br>\
هٰؤُلَآءِ شُهْبَانُ الجَيْشِ (tropical:)  [These are the braves, or<br>\
heroes, of the army]. (A.) ―<br>\

أَشْهَبُ Of the colour termed شُهْبَةٌ; (S, Msb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ شَاهِبٌ, (K,) occurring in the poetry<br>\
of Hudheyl: (TA:) fem. of the former شَهْبَآءُ:<br>\
(S, Msb, K: *) and pl. شُهْبٌ: (O:) the former<br>\
epithet is applied to a horse, (S,) [contr. to an<br>\
assertion of IAar, (see 4,)] and to a he-mule,<br>\
(Msb,) and شَهْبَآءُ to a she-mule. (Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
[Golius, on the authority of Meyd, explains<br>\
أَشْهَبُ أَدْهَمُ, applied to a horse, as meaning Subniger, spadiceus: and أَشْهَبُ أَخْضَرُ as meaning<br>\
lucide leviterve viridis: the correct meaning of<br>\
the former seems to be of a blackish, or brownish,<br>\
gray: and that of the latter, of a dark dustcoloured gray: see أَدْهَمُ and أَخْضَرُ.] الشَّهْبَآءُ was<br>\
the name of a mare belonging to El-Kattál ElBejelee. (O, K; in the CK El-Bejlee.) Applied<br>\
to a she-goat, شَهْبَآءُ signifies Of a white colour<br>\
intermixed with black: thus applied, it is like<br>\
مَلْحَآءُ applied to a ewe. (K.) Applied to a غُرَّة<br>\

from الأَشْهَبُ as though this were a subst.] applied<br>\
to the Benu-l-Mundhir, (K,) or one of the troops<br>\
of En-Noamán Ibn-El-Mundhir, consisting of the<br>\
sons of his paternal uncle and his maternal uncles,<br>\
and their brethren; (TA;) so called because of<br>\
their comeliness, (K,) or because of the whiteness<br>\
of their faces. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to ambergris,<br>\
(K, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  Of an excellent colour, i. e., (TA,)<br>\
inclining to whiteness. (K, TA.) And applied to<br>\
an iron head or blade of an arrow or of a spear<br>\
&amp;c., (tropical:)  That has been filed so that its blackness has<br>\
gone: (S, A, TA:) or that has been filed lightly,<br>\
so that all its blackness has not gone. (AHn,<br>\
TA.) [Hence,] كَتِيبَةٌ شَهْبَآءُ (assumed tropical:)  A great troop having<br>\
numerous weapons; (K;) so called because of<br>\
the iron; (S;) or because of the whiteness of the<br>\
weapons and iron, intermixed with blackness: or<br>\

armour] is white and bright: (TA:) or, as also<br>\
↓ كَتِيبَةٌ شَهَّابَةٌ, a troop upon which is [seen] the<br>\
whiteness of the iron [weapons &amp;c.]. (T, TA.<br>\
[See also كَتِيبَةٌ مَلْحَآءُ, voce أَمْلَحُ.]) And جَيْشٌ<br>\
أَشْهَبُ A strong army [app. because of its numerous<br>\
weapons]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَرْضٌ شَهْبَآءُ (assumed tropical:)  A land in which<br>\
is no verdure, by reason of the paucity of rain.<br>\
(TA.) And [hence,] سَنَةٌ شَهْبَآءُ (tropical:)  A year of<br>\
drought, or sterility, white in consequence thereof,<br>\
(TA,) in which is no verdure, or in which is no<br>\
rain: (K, TA:) next in degree is the بَيْضَآء; then,<br>\
the حَمْرَآء, which is more severe than the بَيْضَآء;<br>\
(TA;) and then, the سَوْدَآء: (TA in art. حمر:)<br>\
or a year that is white by reason of the abundance<br>\
of snow and the want of herbage: (IB, TA:) or<br>\
a year of drought, or sterility; because the seedproduce dries up therein, and becomes yellow:<br>\
and عَامٌ أَشْهَبُ signifies the same. (Har p. 150.)<br>\
And أَشْهَبَانِ (assumed tropical:)  Two white years (عَامَانِ أَبْيَضَانِ)<br>\
between which is no verdure (K, TA) of herbage.<br>\

TA:) a day of cold wind and hoar frost; and<br>\
[in like manner] the night (اللَّيْلَةُ) is termed شَهْبَآءُ.<br>\

فِدًى لِبَنِى ذُهْلِ بْنِ شَيْبَانَ نَاقَتِى<br>\
إِذَا كَانَ يَوْمٌ ذُو كَوَاكِبَ أَشْهَبُ<br>\
[May my she-camel be a ransom for the sons of<br>\
Dhuhl Ibn-Sheybán when there is a day of difficulties, or distresses, . . .] the meaning may be<br>\
اشهب [or whitish] by reason of the whiteness of the<br>\
weapons, or by reason of the dust. (TA.) And<br>\
الشُّهْبُ [pl. of أَشْهَبُ], (O,) or ↓ الشُّهُبُ [pl. of شِهَابٌ],<br>\
(K,) [but the former, I think, is evidently the<br>\
right,] (assumed tropical:)  The white nights; (اللَّيَالِى البِيضُ;) [i. e.<br>\
the thirteenth and fourteenth and fifteenth nights<br>\
of the lunar month; so called because lighted by<br>\
the moon throughout, (see art. بيض;)] (O;)<br>\
three nights of the month; (K, TA;) because of<br>\

art. بزل.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  And الأَشْهَبُ signifies The lion. (O,<br>\
K.) [And in the Deewán of Jereer, it is applied<br>\
to The swine. (Freytag.)]<br>\
