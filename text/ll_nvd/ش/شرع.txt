The beasts entered into the water, (S, K, TA,)<br>\
and drank of it: (TA:) and شَرَعَ, aor. as above,<br>\
and so the inf. ns., he (one coming to water to<br>\
drink) took the water with his mouth: (TA:) or<br>\
شَرَعْتُ فِى المَآءِ, inf. ns. as above, I drank the<br>\
water with my hands: or I entered into the<br>\
water: and شَرَعَ المَالُ the cattle came to the water<br>\
to drink: (Msb:) and الدَّابَّةُ ↓ شَرَّعَتِ [if not a<br>\
mistranscription for شُرِّعَت] the beast was, or<br>\

pointed directly [towards a person: see an explanation of the trans. verb in what follows]. (S,<br>\
K: but in the latter, شَرَعَت, said of spears.) See<br>\
also شَرْعٌ. ―<br>\
-b5-  And, said of a road, (Mgh,) and of<br>\
an affair, or a case, (TA,) It was, or became,<br>\
apparent, manifest, or plain. (IAar, Mgh, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شَرَعَ المَالَ, aor. as above, [inf. n., app., شَرْعٌ,]<br>\
He brought the cattle to the watering-place; a<br>\

signifies the bringing camels to the wateringplace to drink without requiring in doing so to<br>\
draw with the pulley and its appertenances nor<br>\
to give them to drink in a watering-trough or<br>\
tank. (O, K.) It is said in a prov, (S,) أَهْوَنُ<br>\
↓ السَّقْىِ التَّشْرِيعُ (S, K) The easiest mode of<br>\
watering is the making of the camels to enter into<br>\
the water: applied to him who takes an easy way<br>\
of performing an affair, and does not exert himself<br>\

One says, شَرَعَ اللّٰهُ لَنَا كَذَا God made apparent,<br>\
manifest, or plain, to us, such a thing. (Msb.)<br>\
And شَرَعَ فُلَانٌ Such a one made apparent, manifest, or plain, the truth, or right. (TA.) ―<br>\

شَرَعَ لَهُمْ i. q. سَنَّ [i. e. He instituted, established,<br>\

-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] one says, اشرع يَدَهُ إِلَى المِطْهَرَةِ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
put his hand [to and] into the مطهرة [or vessel<br>\
for purification]. (TA.) And it is said in a trad.<br>\
(respecting the [ablution termed] وُضُوْء), حَتَّى<br>\
أَشْرَعَ فِى العَضُدِ meaning Until, or so that, he<br>\
made the upper half of the arm to reach to (lit.<br>\
to enter) the water. (TA. [This ex. is elliptical<br>\

gave me what sufficed me: and اشرعنى الشَّىْءُ<br>\

فُلَانٌ يَشْتَرِعُ شِرْعَتَهُ [meaning Such a one<br>\
originates, or embraces, or follows, his way of<br>\
religion] is similar to the phrases يَفْتَطِرُ فِطْرَتَهُ and<br>\
يَمْتَلُّ مِلَّتَهُ; from شِرْعَةُ الدِّينِ and فِطْرَتُهُ and مِلَّتُهُ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
شَرْعٌ, originally an inf. n.: ―<br>\
-b2-  then applied as a<br>\
name for A manifest, a plain, or an open, track,<br>\
or road, or way: ―<br>\
-b3-  and then, metaphorically, to<br>\
The divine way of religion; so says Er-Rághib;<br>\
(TA;) syn. with شَرِيعَةٌ, q. v. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  In the<br>\
saying مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ شَرْعِكَ, (so in the K,) or مررت<br>\
بِرَجُلٍ شَرْعُكَ مِنْ رَجُلٍ, (so in the S and O, [for<br>\
هُوَ شَرْعُكَ,]) with kesr and with damm to the ع [of<br>\
شرعك], (TA,) i. e. [I passed by a man] sufficing<br>\
thee [as a man], (S, O, K,) the meaning is, of the<br>\
sort to which thou directest thyself and which<br>\
thou seekest (فِيهِ وَتَطْلُبُهُ ↓ تَشْرَعُ): (S, O:) and the<br>\
word in this sense is used alike as sing. and pl.<br>\
(S, O, K) and dual, because it is [originally] an<br>\
inf. n. (S, O.) You say, شَرْعُكَ هٰذَا [and هٰذَانِ<br>\
and هٰؤُلَآءِ] i. e. Sufficient for thee [is this and are<br>\
these two and are these]. (S: and the like is said<br>\
in the Mgh.) And it is said in a prov.,<br>\
شَرْعُكَ مَا بَلَّغَكَ المَحَلَّا<br>\
thus correctly, for it is a hemistich; not المَحَلَّ,<br>\
as in the S and K; (TA;) i. e. Sufficient travel-ling-provision for thee is that which will cause<br>\
thee to reach the place [of alighting] to which thou<br>\
repairest: (K, TA:) applied to the case of being<br>\
content with little. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also شَرَعٌ, in<br>\
two places. ―<br>\
-b6-  And see شِرْعَةٌ.<br>\
شِرْعٌ [in the CK, erroneously, شَرْع,] The like of<br>\
a thing; as also ↓ شِرْعَةٌ: (K, TA:) [but the former<br>\
is masc. and ↓ the latter is fem.; for] one says,<br>\
هٰذَا شِرْعُ هٰذَا This is the like of this; and so هٰذِهِ<br>\
هٰذِهِ ↓ شِرْعَةُ: and هٰذَانِ شِرْعَانِ these two are likes.<br>\
(S, O, TA.) [The pls., or rather coll. gen. ns. and<br>\
pls., following this meaning in the K belong to<br>\
شِرْعَةٌ and شَرْعَةٌ in another sense; as is shown by<br>\
exs. in the O and TA.]<br>\
-A2-  Also The chords of the<br>\
بَرْبَط, (O, K, TA,) which is the [Persian] عُود<br>\
[or lute]. (TA.) [In this sense, a coll. gen. n.:]<br>\
see its n. un. شِرْعَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, as being likened<br>\
thereto, (TA,) (tropical:)  The [thong called] شِرَاك of a<br>\
sandal. (O, K, TA.) It is related in a trad. that<br>\
a man said, إِنِّى أُحِبُّ الجَمَالَ حَتَّى فِى شِرْعِ نَعْلِى<br>\
(O, TA) i. e. (tropical:)  [Verily I love elegance, even] in<br>\
the شراك of my sandal. (TA.)<br>\
شَرَعٌ: see شَرِيعَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  One says, النَّاسُ فِى هٰذَا<br>\
الأَمْرِ شَرَعٌ and ↓ شَرْعٌ, (S, Msb, K,) the latter a<br>\
contraction of the former, (Msb,) allowed by Kr<br>\
and Kz, but disallowed by Yaakoob, (IDrst,<br>\
TA,) The people are in this affair equals: (S,<br>\
Msb, K:) in this sense, used alike as sing. and<br>\
pl. and fem. (S, TA) and masc.: (TA:) [of<br>\
شَرَعٌ] Az says that it seems to be pl. [or quasi-pl.<br>\
n.] of ↓ شَارِعٌ, like as خَدَمٌ is of خَادِمٌ; i. e., [the<br>\
phrase means] the people enter into this affair<br>\
(يَشْرَعُونَ فِيهِ) together. (TA.) One says also,<br>\
النَّاسُ شَرَعٌ وَاحِدٌ and واحد ↓ شَرْعٌ, meaning The<br>\
people are one sort. (K.)<br>\
شَرْعَةٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\

قَطًا, (Lth, O, K, TA,) with which to capture<br>\
them, (O, TA,) made of sinews: (Lth, O, TA:)<br>\

-b2-  Also, (S, O, K,) and ↓ شَرْعَةٌ,<br>\
(K,) A string, or chord: (S, O, K, TA:) or such<br>\
as is slender: or while continuing stretched upon<br>\
the bow; (TA;) and so ↓ شِرَاعٌ; (Lth, O, K;) or<br>\
upon the lute; and so ↓ شِرَاعٌ: (TA:) the pl. [or<br>\
rather coll. gen. n.] (of ↓ شِرْعَةٌ, S, O, [i. e. of this<br>\
n. un. meaning the “ chord of a lute,” as is shown<br>\
by exs. in the O and TA,]) is ↓ شِرْعٌ (S, O, K)<br>\
and (that of ↓ شَرْعَةٌ, TA) ↓ شَرْعٌ, (O, K, TA,) like<br>\
as تَمْرٌ is of تَمْرَةٌ, (O, TA,) and [the pl. properly<br>\
so termed] (of شِرْعَةٌ, S, O) شِرَعٌ, and pl. pl. شِرَاعٌ:<br>\
(S, O, K:) and the pl. of ↓ شِرَاعٌ as a sing. syn.<br>\
with شِرْعَةٌ is شُرُعٌ. (TA.)<br>\
شَرَعَةٌ i. q. سَقِيفَةٌ [i. e. A roof, or covering, such<br>\
as projects over the door of a house &amp;c.; or a<br>\
place roofed over]: pl. أَشْرَاعٌ. (O, K.)<br>\

or legitimate.]<br>\
شُرَاعٌ A plant, or herbage, full-grown, (O, K,<br>\
TA,) that satiates the camels. (TA.)<br>\
شِرَاعٌ: see شَرِيعَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  The شِرَاعٌ of a ship or<br>\
boat (S, Mgh, O, Msb) is called in Pers. بَادْبَان<br>\
[i. e. A sail]; (MA, Mgh, KL;) i. q. قِلْعٌ; (MA,<br>\
TA;) a thing like a wide مُلَآءَة [q. v.], (O, K,<br>\
TA,) of cloth or of matting, (TA,) [raised, or<br>\
attached,] upon a piece of wood [i. e. a mast or a<br>\
yard]; which is beaten upon by the wind (تُصَفِّقُهُ<br>\
الرِّيحُ,) and causes the ship, or boat, to go along:<br>\
(O, K, TA:) so called because it is raised (يُشْرَعُ<br>\
i. e. يُرْفَعُ) above the ship, or boat: (TA:) pl.<br>\
أَشْرِعَةٌ and شُرُعٌ; (O, K;) the former a pl. of pauc.<br>\
(O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, as being likened thereto,<br>\
(TA, [and the same is implied in the S and O,])<br>\
(tropical:)  The neck of a camel. (S, O, K, TA.) Sometimes<br>\
they said of a camel, رَفَعَ شِرَاعَهُ, meaning (tropical:)  He<br>\

-b3-  One says also<br>\
رَجُلٌ شِرَاعُ الأَنْفِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  A man having the<br>\

man. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Good, or excellent, flax.<br>\

-b2-  And The ليف [or fibres that grow at the<br>\
base of the branches of the palm-tree] of which the<br>\
prickles (شَوْك) are strong, and such as, by reason<br>\
of their thickness, are fit for the sewing of leather<br>\
therewith. (TA.)<br>\

and مَآءٍ ↓ شِرَاعُ (TA) A watering-place; a resort<br>\

TA;) a place to which men come to drink therefrom and to draw water, (Msb, * TA,) and into<br>\
which they sometimes make their beasts to enter,<br>\
to drink: (TA:) but the term ↓ مشرعة, (Az,<br>\
Msb,) or شريعة, (TA,) is not applied by the<br>\
Arabs to any but [a watering-place] such as is<br>\
permanent, and apparent to the eye, (Az, Msb,<br>\
TA,) like the water of rivers, (Msb,) not water<br>\
from which one draws with the well-rope: (Az,<br>\
Msb, TA:) the pl. of شَرِيعَةٌ is شَرَائِعُ; and that of<br>\
↓ مَشْرَعَةٌ or ↓ مَشْرَعٌ [or of both] is مَشَارِعُ; which<br>\
is also expl. as meaning gaps, or breaches, in the<br>\
banks of rivers or the like by which men or beasts<br>\
come to water: (TA:) and [in like manner it is<br>\
said that] شَرِيعَةٌ signifies a place of descent to<br>\
water: (Lth, TA:) or a way to water. (Bd in<br>\
v. 52.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (Lth, Kr, Msb, TA, and<br>\
Bd ubi suprà,) الشَّرِيعَةُ, (Lth, Kr, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,)<br>\
as also ↓ الشِّرْعَةُ, (Msb, K, &amp;c.,) and ↓ الشَّرْعُ,<br>\
(Msb,) signifies likewise الدِّينُ; (Msb, and Bd<br>\
ubi suprà;) because it is a way to the means of<br>\
eternal life; (Bd ibid.;) or because of its manifestness; (Msb;) [i. e.] The religious law of God;<br>\
(Lth, Kr, S, O, K, * TA;) consisting of such ordinances as those of fasting and prayer and pilgrimage (Lth, Kr, TA) and the giving of the poorrate (Kr, TA) and marriage, (Lth, TA,) and<br>\
other acts (Lth, Kr, TA) of piety, or of obedience<br>\
to God, or of duty to Him and to men: (Kr,<br>\

conduct that is manifest (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, Mgh, K)<br>\
and right (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, K) in religion; (Mgh;)<br>\

شُرَاعِىٌّ, as an epithet applied to A spear-head<br>\
and a spear, of Shuráa, (TA,) which was the<br>\
name of a certain man who made spear-heads and<br>\
spears, (K, TA,) as they assert: but IAar says<br>\
that it may be a reg. rel. n. from شُرَاعٌ, or an<br>\
irreg. rel. n. from some other name of which the<br>\
radical latters are شرع: and [SM says also that,]<br>\
applied to a spear, it signifies long: (TA:) or<br>\
↓ شِرَاعِىٌّ, thus applied, has this meaning, a rel. n.<br>\
[from شِرَاعٌ]. (S, O.) شُرَاعِيَّةٌ and ↓ شِرَاعِيَّةٌ [in the<br>\
CK without teshdeed], applied to a she-camel,<br>\
signify (tropical:)  Long-necked; (O, K, TA:) thus expl.<br>\
by ISh: but Az thinks the latter to be the more<br>\
probably correct; the neck being likened to the<br>\
شِرَاع of the ship or boat, because of the height<br>\
thereof. (O.)<br>\
شِرَاعِىٌّ; and its fem., with ة: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
شَرَّاعٌ A seller of the flax called شَرِيع. (IAar, K.)<br>\
شَارِعٌ Entering into water [to drink]: pl. شُرَّعٌ<br>\

(Aboo-Leylà, TA:) or raising their heads: (K,<br>\
TA:) or directing themselves, or repairing,<br>\
(شَارِعَاتٌ,) from the deep water to the bank, or<br>\
side: (S, TA:) and حيتان شُرُوعٌ signifies the<br>\
same: (TA:) or شُرَّعًا in the Kur vii. 163, referring to fish, means appearing upon the surface<br>\
of the water. (Bd, Jel. *) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, applied to a<br>\
place of alighting, or an abode, (مَنْزِلٌ,) Situate<br>\
upon a road that is a thoroughfare: and شَارِعَةٌ<br>\
applied to a house (دَارٌ) signifies the same; (K;)<br>\
or having its door [opening] upon such a road;<br>\
(TA;) or near to the road and to the people [or<br>\
passengers]: (Mgh, * TA:) and دُورٌ شَارِعَةٌ houses<br>\
having their doors opening into the streets: or<br>\
دُورٌ شَوَارِعُ, as expl. by IDrd, houses upon one open<br>\
road. (TA.) It is said in a trad., كَانَتِ الأَبْوَابُ<br>\
شَارِعَةً إِلَى المَسْجِدِ The doors were opening towards<br>\
the mosque. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And Anything near (K,<br>\
TA) to a thing, or overlooking it: whence شَارِعَةٌ<br>\
applied to a house (دَارٌ) near to the road and to<br>\

نُجُومٌ شَوَارِعُ Stars near to setting. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [Also<br>\
Pointing directly towards a person; applied to a<br>\
spear.] One says رِمَاحٌ شَارِعَةٌ and شَوَارِعُ (K, TA)<br>\
and شُرَّعٌ as in some of the copies of the S (TA)<br>\
Spears pointing directly: and ↓ رِمَاحٌ مَشْرُوعَةٌ and<br>\

or يَشْرَعُ فِيهِ النَّاسُ, Mgh, TA) in common, or in<br>\
general; (Mgh, Msb, TA;) by a tropical attribution; (Mgh;) [i. e.] شَارِعٌ in this case has the<br>\
