شَكَرَ لَهُ, and شَكَرَهُ, (S, Mgh, K,) but the<br>\
former is the more chaste, (S,) and the latter is<br>\
for شَكَرَ نِعْمَتَهُ, (A,) aor.<br>\
شَكُرَ, (TA,) inf. n. شُكْرٌ and<br>\
شُكْرَانٌ (S, A, * Msb, K) and شُكُورٌ, (S, K) which<br>\
last, in the Kur lxxvi. 9, may be either an inf. n.<br>\
or pl. of شُكْرٌ [used as a simple subst.], (S,) He<br>\
thanked him; or praised, eulogized, or commended,<br>\
him, for a benefit or benefits: (S:) he was grateful, or thankful, to him; or he acknowledged his<br>\
beneficence, and spoke of it largely: (S, *  K: [but<br>\
in the S, the verb in the former sense has شُكْرٌ<br>\
only for its inf. n., and it is implied that in the<br>\
latter sense it has for its inf. n. only شُكْرَانٌ, as<br>\
will be seen below:]) and شَكَرَ لِلّٰهِ, and شَكَرَ اللّٰهَ,<br>\
(Lh, Msb, K,) which latter is less common than<br>\
the former, and even disallowed by As in prose,<br>\
though allowed by him in verse, (Msb,) and<br>\
شَكَرَ بِاللّٰهِ and شَكَرَ نِعْمَةَ اللّٰهِ, and شَكَرَ بِنِعْمَةِ اللّٰهِ,<br>\
(Lh, K,) and شَكَرَ لِلّٰهِ نِعْمَتَهُ, (A,) inf. n. شُكْرٌ and<br>\
شُكْرَانٌ (Msb) [and شُكُورٌ], He thanked, or praised,<br>\
God for his beneficence: (A:) he was grateful, or<br>\
thankful, to God; or acknowledged his beneficence,<br>\
and spoke of it largely: (K:) he acknowledge<br>\
the beneficence of God, and acted in the manner<br>\
incumbent on him in rendering Him obedience<br>\
and abstaining from disobedience; so that شُكْر is<br>\
in word and in deed: (Msb:) and لَهُ ↓ تَشَكَّرَ<br>\
signifies the same as شَكَرَ لَهُ: (S, A, Msb, K:) you<br>\
say, لَهُ مَا صَنَعَ ↓ تَشَكَّرْتُ [I thanked him, &amp;c., for<br>\
what he did]: (A:) and لَهُ بَلَآءَهُ ↓ تشكّر [He was<br>\
grateful to Him, &amp;c., i. e. to God, for his probation]: (K:) and أَشْكُرُ إِلَيْكَ نِعَمَ اللّٰهِ [I praise to<br>\
thee, or mention to thee with thanks, the favours<br>\
of God]: (L in art. حمد:) [but there are many<br>\
explanations of شَكَرَ beside those given above: its<br>\
meanings will be more fully shown by what here<br>\
follows:] شُكْرٌ is the thanking a benefactor; or<br>\
praising, eulogizing, or commending, him, (S, A,)<br>\
for a benefits: (S:) or the being grateful, or thankful; or acknowledging beneficence;<br>\
and speaking of it largely; and [in the copies of<br>\
the K, “or,” but this is evidently a mistake,] it is<br>\
only on account of favour received; (K;) and<br>\
شُكْرَانٌ is [the same, being] contr. of كُفْرَانٌ: (S:)<br>\
شُكْرٌ [sometimes] differs from حَمْدٌ; (Msb in art.<br>\
حمد;) for شكر is only on account of favour received; whereas حمد is sometimes because of<br>\
favour received, (Th, Az, TA in art. حمد, and<br>\
Msb ubi suprà,) and sometimes form other causes;<br>\
(Th ubi suprà;) [and thus] the latter is of more<br>\
common application than the former; (S in art.<br>\
حمد;) therefore you do not say شَكَرْتُهُ عَلَى<br>\
شَجَاعَتِهِ, but you say حَمِدْتُهُ على شجاعته: (Msb<br>\
ubi suprà:) or شُكْرٌ is more common than حَمْدٌ<br>\
with respect to its kinds and means, and more<br>\
particular with respect to the objects to which it<br>\
relates; and the latter is more common with<br>\
respect to the objects to which it relates, and<br>\
more particular with respect to the means; for the<br>\
former is, with the heart, the being humble, or<br>\
lowly, and submissive; and with the tongue, the<br>\
act of praising, eulogizing, or commending; and<br>\
acknowledging beneficence; and with the members,<br>\
the act of obeying, and submitting one&#39;s self; and<br>\
the object to which it relates is the benefactor,<br>\
exclusively of his essential qualities; therefore<br>\
one does not say شَكَرْنَا اللّٰهَ عَلَى حَيَاتِهِ [we thanked<br>\
God for his existence, or praised Him, &amp;c.]; but<br>\
He is مَحْمُود on that account, like as He is for his<br>\
beneficence; and شُكْرٌ is also for beneficence: thus<br>\
حَمْدٌ relates to every object to which, as an object,<br>\
شُكْرٌ relates; but the reverse is not the case: and<br>\
everything whereby is حمد, thereby is شكر; but<br>\
the reverse is not the case; for the latter is by<br>\
means of the members, or limbs, and the former<br>\
is by means of the tongue: شُكْرٌ is of three kinds;<br>\
with the heart, or mind, which is the forming an<br>\
[adequate] idea of the benefit; and with the<br>\
tongue, which is the praising, eulogizing, or<br>\
commending, the benefactor; and with the members, or limbs, which is the requiting the benefit<br>\
according to its desert: it rests upon five foundations; humility of him who renders it towards<br>\
him to whom it is rendered; his love of him; his<br>\
acknowledgment of his benefit; the eulogizing<br>\
him for it; and his not making use of the benefit<br>\
in a manner which he [who has conferred it] dislikes: it is also explained as devotion of the heart<br>\
to love of the benefactor, and of the members to<br>\
obey him, and the employment of the tongue in<br>\
mentioning him and eulogizing him: [and there<br>\
are several other explanations of it which it is<br>\
unnecessary to add:] some say that it is formed<br>\
by transposition from كَشْرٌ, the “ act of uncovering, or exposing to view: ” others, that it is from<br>\
عَيْنٌ شَكْرَى “ a full fountain, or eye; ” accord. to<br>\
which etymology it would signify the being full<br>\
of the praise of the benefactor. (B, TA.) ―<br>\

commending [a person]: (K:) or (assumed tropical:)  the forgiving<br>\
a man: or (tropical:)  the regarding him with content,<br>\
satisfaction, good will, or favour: and hence,<br>\

in the K that these verbs are from شكير in all of<br>\
certain significations there mentioned; app. meaning, all that are there mentioned after the next<br>\
preceding verb: and hence they seem to have<br>\
the significations here following: ―<br>\
-b4-  said of palmtrees (نَخْل), (assumed tropical:)  They put forth leaves around<br>\
their branches:: ―<br>\
