شَفِقَ and<br>\
شَفَقَ: see 4, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  شَفِقَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ signifies He was niggardly of it: (TA:)<br>\
[thus] the saying [of a poet]<br>\
كَمَا شَفِقَتْ عَلَى الزَّادِ العِيَالُ<br>\
means [Like as the household] are niggardly of<br>\
the provision: (IDrd, M, O:) because he who is<br>\
niggardly of a thing is عَلَيْهِ ↓ مُشْفِقٌ [i. e. fearful, or cautious, on account of it]. (M.)<br>\
2<br>\
تَشْفِيقٌ signifies (tropical:)  The making [a gift or the<br>\
like (see مُشَفَّقٌ)] scanty, or little in amount or<br>\
quantity; as also ↓ إِشْفَاقٌ. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
(tropical:)  The weaving badly. (K, TA.) You say, شفّق<br>\
المِلْحَفَةَ (tropical:)  He wove badly, (M,) or so as to make<br>\
it scanty in the yarn, or unsubstantial, (TA,) the<br>\
[kind of wrapper called] ملحفة. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also 4, last sentence.<br>\
4<br>\
اشفق signifies He feared, or was cautious;<br>\
as also ↓ شَفِقَ [in the CK شَفَقَ]; or only the<br>\
former: (K, TA:) [accord. to ISd,] ↓ شَفِقَ, inf. n.<br>\
شَفَقٌ, signifies he feared: (M:) IDrd says, ↓ شَفِقْتُ<br>\
[in one of my copies of the S شفَقتُ] and أَشْفَقْتُ<br>\
are syn., (S, O, TA,) as some assert, (O, TA,)<br>\
but the lexicologists disallow this, (S, O,) saying<br>\
that one should only say أَشْفَقْتُ: (O:) accord. to<br>\
Er-Rághib, الإِشْفَاقُ signifies [the being affected<br>\
with] care, or solicitude, mixed with fear; and<br>\
when it is trans. by means of مِنْ, the meaning of<br>\
fear is most apparent in it; but when trans. by<br>\
means of عَلَى, the meaning of care, or solicitude,<br>\
is most apparent in it: (TA: [and the like is said<br>\
by Bd in xxi. 29:]) or it signifies [the being<br>\
affected with] fright [or fear]; sometimes mixed<br>\
with faithful or sincere or honest advice; and<br>\
sometimes divested thereof: (Ham p. 179:) one<br>\
says, أَشْفَقْتُ مِنْهُ, (S,) or مِنْ كَذَا, (Msb,) I<br>\
feared, or was cautious of, (S, Msb,) him, or it,<br>\
(S,) or such a thing: (Msb:) or اشفق مِنْهُ he<br>\
feared him, or it: (MA:) and أَشْفَقْتُ عَلَيْهِ, (S,<br>\
[in which it is implied that this differs from<br>\
أَشْفَقْتُ مِنْهُ,]) or عَلَى الصَّغِيرِ, I was affectionate,<br>\
kind, or compassionate, and favourably inclined,<br>\
[towards him, or] towards the little one: (Msb:<br>\
[and a similar explanation is given in the MA:])<br>\
and ↓ شَفَقْتُ, aor.<br>\
شَفِقَ, is a dial. var. thereof [i. e. of<br>\
أَشْفَقْتُ when trans. by means of عَلَى, and perhaps<br>\
also when it is trans. by means of مِنْ]: (Msb:)<br>\
or اشفق عَلَيْهِ signifies [he was solicitously affectionate, &amp;c., towards him; agreeably with the<br>\
explanation of Er-Rághib above, and with that<br>\
here following;] he was affected with pity, or compassion, and tenderness, and fear, for him, at the<br>\
same time giving him faithful or sincere or honest<br>\
advice, أَنْ يَنَالَهُ مَكْرُوهٌ [lest some disliked or evil<br>\
event should betide him]: (TA:) or he feared, or<br>\
was cautious, for him: and اشفق مِنْهُ he was<br>\
impatient of him, or it: and ↓ شَفَقَ is a dial. var.<br>\
[of اشفق when trans. by means of مِنْ, and app.<br>\
also when trans. by means of عَلَى]. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also 2.<br>\
-A3-  Also He entered upon [the time of]<br>\
the شَفَق [q. v.]. (M.) And He came in a [time<br>\
of] شَفَق: and so ↓ شفّق. (M.)<br>\
شَفَقٌ Fear: (K:) [see also شَفِقَ, (of which it is<br>\
the inf. n.) in the next preceding paragraph:] or<br>\
fear [arising] from strictness (شِدَّة) of faithful<br>\
or sincere or honest advice; (M, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ شَفَقَةٌ: (M:) or ↓ the latter signifies the fear of<br>\
him who gives faithful or sincere or honest advice,<br>\
in consequence of his doing so, for him to whom<br>\
such advice is given: (O:) or the former, (K,<br>\
TA,) and ↓ the latter also, (TA,) the eagerness,<br>\
or striving, of him who gives such advice, to<br>\
rectify, or amend, the state of him to whom that<br>\
advice is given: (K, TA: [said in the latter to be<br>\
a tropical application of the words; but why, I see<br>\
not:]) ↓ شَفَقَةٌ is subst. from الإِشْفَاقُ, (S, Msb,<br>\
TA,) and شَفَقٌ is syn. therewith (S, O, K, TA) as<br>\
being also a subst. from الإِشْفَاقُ: (S, TA:) [it is<br>\
said that] the primary signification of ↓ شَفَقَةٌ is<br>\
weakness: (Ham p. 179:) and it is conjoined with<br>\
خَوْفٌ [fear]; therefore it is not applied as an<br>\
attribute to God: (Idem p. 722:) [generally] it<br>\
signifies affection, kindness, benignity, compassion, or favourable inclination: (MA:) [or<br>\
solicitous affection &amp;c.:] or pity, or compassion,<br>\
and tenderness, and fear of the betiding of some<br>\
disliked or evil event, together with faithful or<br>\
sincere or honest advice. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شَفَقٌ also<br>\
signifies The redness (Kh, S, Msb, K) in the<br>\
horizon (K) from sunset until the time of the last<br>\
عِشَآء [i. e. nightfall], (Kh, S, Msb, K,) when it<br>\
disappears, (Kh, S, Msb,) and the white شَفَق<br>\
remains until the middle [or rather until a late<br>\
period varying at different seasons] of the night:<br>\
(Msb:) or until near that time: or until near the<br>\
عَتَمَة [q. v., generally meaning the same, or nearly<br>\
so]: (K:) or the redness that is seen in the sky at<br>\
sunset: (IDrd, O:) or the remains of the light<br>\
and redness of the sun in the first part of the<br>\
night, until near the عَتَمَة: (S:) or the light and<br>\
redness of the sun, seen at sunset, until the time<br>\
of the prayer of nightfall: (M:) or the mixture<br>\
of the light of day with the blackness of night at<br>\
sunset: (Er-Rághib, TA:) accord. to Zj, the<br>\
redness that is in the region of sunset after the<br>\
setting of the sun: this is the meaning given as of<br>\
common repute in the books of lexicology; and<br>\
Mtr says [in the Mgh] that it means the redness<br>\
accord. to a number of the Companions of the<br>\
Prophet and of the people of the generation next<br>\
succeeding them: but accord. to Aboo-Hureyreh,<br>\
it means the whiteness [after sunset, which, to<br>\
distinguish it from the شَفَق commonly so called,<br>\
is often termed the white شَفَق, as in an instance<br>\
above]: (Msb:) IAth says that this word has<br>\
two contr. meanings; being applied to the redness<br>\
that is seen after sunset; and to the whiteness<br>\
remaining in the western horizon after the said<br>\
redness. (TA.) Fr says, I heard one of the<br>\
Arabs say, عَلَيْهِ ثَوْبٌ كَأَنَّهُ الشَّفَقُ [Upon him is,<br>\
or was, a garment as though it were the شَفَق]:<br>\
and it was red. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  A garment,<br>\
or piece of cloth, dyed red. (AA, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
Day. (Zj, M, K.)<br>\
-A3-  Also i. q. نَاحِيَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [A side,<br>\
&amp;c.; or a remote side]: pl. أَشْفَاقٌ. (O, K.) One<br>\
says, أَنَا فِى أَشْفَاقٍ مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ i. e. نَوَاحٍ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  I am apart, or aloof, from this affair; as<br>\
though in, or on, remote sides thereof]: (O, TA:)<br>\
and in like manner فِى عُرُوضٍ مِنْهُ [app. a mistranscription for عَرُوضٍ i. e. نَاحِيَةٍ] and فى<br>\
أَعْرَاضٍ منه i. e. نَوَاحٍ. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  And (tropical:)  A bad<br>\
thing; syn. رَدِىْءٌ: (Lth, S, M, O, K, TA: [in the<br>\
TA said to be written by J with kesr to the ف;<br>\
but not so in either of my copies of the S:])<br>\
applied to a garment, or piece of cloth, (Mgh,<br>\
TA, and Ham p. 179,) [in this sense, or] as<br>\
meaning bad and thin: (Mgh in art. خرث:)<br>\
[said to be] from شَفَقَةٌ signifying “ weakness: ”<br>\
(Ham ubi suprà:) seldom pluralized: (O:) and<br>\
used alike as masc. and fem., being applied as an<br>\
epithet to a مِلْحَفَة, (M, O,) meaning رَدِيئَةٌ. (M.)<br>\
شَفِقٌ: see شَفِيقٌ, in two places.<br>\
شَفَقَةٌ: see شَفَقٌ, in five places.<br>\
شَفُوقٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
شَفِيقٌ is syn. with ↓ مُشْفِقٌ as part. n. of 4 [signifying Fearing, or fearful, or cautious; and also<br>\
affectionate, kind, or compassionate, &amp;c.]; (S, O,<br>\
Msb, * K;) as also ↓ شَفِقٌ (Msb) [and in an intensive sense ↓ شَفُوقٌ; and , from what follows, it<br>\
appears that شَفِيقٌ also is used as an intensive<br>\
epithet]: or ↓ شَفِقٌ signifies fearing; and its pl. is<br>\
شَفِقُونَ: (M, TA:) and شَفِيقٌ, one giving faithful<br>\
or sincere or honest advice, eager, or striving, to<br>\
rectify, or amend, the state of him to whom that<br>\
advice is given. (M.)<br>\
إِنَّ الشَّفِيقَ بِسُوْءِ ظَنٍ مُولَعٌ<br>\
[Verily the affectionate, &amp;c., or the very affectionate &amp;c., is addicted to evil opinion,] is a<br>\
prov., applied in the case of the man who fears,<br>\
for his friend, the accidents of fortune, by reason<br>\
of his excessive شَفَقَة [or affection, &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
And it is said in the Kur [xxi. 50], وَهُمْ مِنَ<br>\
↓ السَّاعَةِ مُشْفِقُونَ [meaning And who are fearful<br>\
of the time of the resurrection]; the signification<br>\
of fear being most apparent when مُشْفِقٌ is thus<br>\
trans. by means of مِنْ. (TA.) See also an<br>\
instance of ↓ مُشْفِقٌ [in a similar sense] in the first<br>\
paragraph of this art.<br>\
مُشْفَقٌ: see the last paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  [Accord. to<br>\
Freytag, it signifies also Fear: but he names no<br>\
authority for this.]<br>\
مُشْفِقٌ: see شَفِيقٌ, in three places.<br>\
عَطَآءٌ مُشَفَّقٌ (tropical:)  A gift made scanty, or little in<br>\
amount or quantity; (S, TA;) as also ↓ مُشْفَقٌ.<br>\
