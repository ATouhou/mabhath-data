شَآءَهُ, (Msb,) [originally شَيِئَهُ,] like خَافَهُ,<br>\
[which is originally خَوِفَهُ,] (MF,) first. pers.<br>\
شِئْتُهُ, (S, K,) aor. يَشَاؤُهُ, (Msb,) [and by poetic<br>\
license يَشَاهُ, without ء,] first pers. أَشَاؤُهُ, (S. K,)<br>\
inf. n. شَىْءٌ (Msb, K) and مَشِيْئَةٌ, (S, * K,) or this<br>\
is a simple subst., (Msb,) and مَشَآءَةٌ and مَشَائِيَةٌ,<br>\
(K,) [or these two also are simple substs.,] He,<br>\
and I, willed, wished, or desired, it; syn. أَرَادَهُ<br>\
(Msb) and أَرَدْتُهُ: (S, * K:) most of the scholastic<br>\
theologians make no difference between المَشِيْئَةُ<br>\
and الإِرَادَةُ, though they are [said to be] originally<br>\
different; for the former, in the proper language,<br>\
signifies the causing to be or exist, syn. الإِيجَادُ;<br>\
and the latter, the willing, wishing, or desiring;<br>\
syn. الطَّلَبُ. (TA.) A Jew objected, to the<br>\
Prophet, his people&#39;s saying مَا شَآءَ اللّٰهُ وَشِئْتُ<br>\
[What God hath willed and I have willed], as<br>\
implying the association of another being with<br>\
God: therefore the Prophet ordered them to say<br>\
مَا شَآءَ اللّٰهُ ثُمَّ شِئْتُ [What God hath willed, then I<br>\
have willed]. (TA.) [مَا شَآءَ اللّٰهُ as signifying<br>\
What hath God willed! is used to express admiration. And as signifying What God willed<br>\
it is a phrase often used to denote a vague,<br>\
generally a great or considerable, but sometimes<br>\
a small, number or quantity or time: See De<br>\
Sacy&#39;s Relation de l&#39;Égypte par Abdallatif, pp.<br>\
246 and 394 &amp;c.]<br>\

شَيَّأْتُهُ عَلَى الأَمْرِ [in some copies of the K<br>\
(erroneously) شِئْتُهُ] I incited him, or made him,<br>\
to do the thing, or affair. (As, S, L, K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
And شَيَّأَ اللّٰهُ وَجْهَهُ, (K, TA,) and خَلْقَهُ, (TA,)<br>\
God rendered, or may God render, foul, unseemly, or ugly, his face, (K, TA,) and his make.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَشَآءَهُ إِلَيْهِ He, or it, compelled him, constrained him, or necessitated him, to have recourse,<br>\
or betake himself, to it; syn. أَلْجَأَهُ; (S, K;) a<br>\
dial. var. of أَجَآءَهُ; (S;) of the dial. of Temeem.<br>\
(TA.) Temeem say, شَرٌّ مَا يُشِيؤُكَ إِلَى مُخَّةِ عُرْقُوبٍ,<br>\
meaning يُجِيؤُكَ [q. v., i. e. It is an evil thing<br>\
that compels thee to have recourse to the marrow<br>\
of a hock]. (S.)<br>\
5<br>\
تشيّأ His anger became appeased: (K:)<br>\
said of a man. (TA.)<br>\
شَىْءٌ [A thing; anything; something; somewhat;] a word of well-known meaning: (K:)<br>\
[sometimes, in poetry, written and pronounced<br>\
شَىٌّ: see an ex. in a verse cited voce صُؤَابَةٌ: see also<br>\
the last sentence but one of this paragraph:] الشَّىْءُ<br>\
properly signifies what may be known, and that<br>\
whereof a thing may be predicated: (Mgh, KT:)<br>\
accord. to Sb, it denotes existence, and is a name<br>\
for anything that has been made to have being,<br>\
whether an accident, or attribute, or a substance,<br>\
and such that it may be known, and that a thing<br>\
may be predicated thereof: (KT:) MF says that<br>\
it is app. an inf. n. used in the sense of a pass.<br>\
part. n., meaning what is willed, and meant, or<br>\
intended, [in which sense ↓ مَشِيْئَةٌ (pl. مَشِيْآتٌ) is<br>\
often used,] without restriction to its actuality or<br>\
possibility of being, so that it applies to that which<br>\
necessarily is, and that which may be, and that<br>\
which cannot be; accord. to the opinion adopted<br>\
by the author of the Ksh: [or, as an inf. n. in the<br>\
sense of a pass. part. n., it may be expl., agreeably<br>\
with what is said to be the proper meaning of the<br>\
verb, as signifying what is caused to be or exist;<br>\
accordingly,] Er-Rághib says that it denotes whatever is caused to be or exist, whether sensibly, as<br>\
material substances, or ideally, as sayings; and<br>\
Bd and others expressly assert that it signifies<br>\
peculiarly what is caused to be or exist; but Sb<br>\
says that it is the most general of general terms;<br>\
and some of the scholastic theologians apply it to<br>\
what is non-existent; such, however, are overcome in their argument by its not being found to<br>\
have been thus used by the Arabs, and by such<br>\
passages as كُلُّ شَىْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلَّا وَجْهَهُ [Everything<br>\
is subject to perish except Himself (Kur xxviii.<br>\
last verse)] and وَإِنْ مِنْ شَىْءٍ إِلَّا يُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِهِ<br>\
[And there is not anything but it glorifies Him<br>\
with praising (Kur xvii. 46)], for what is nonexistent cannot be described as perishing nor<br>\
imagined to glorify God: (TA:) the pl. is أَشْيَآءُ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) imperfectly decl., (Msb, TA,)<br>\
or rather this is a quasi-pl. n., (Sb, TA,) respecting<br>\
the formation of which there is much difference<br>\
of opinion [as will be shown hereafter], (Msb,<br>\
TA,) and أَشْيَاوَاتٌ, (S, K,) a pl. pl. [i. e. pl. of<br>\
أَشْيَآءٌ], (MF, TA,) and أَشَاوَاتٌ, [a contraction of<br>\
that next preceding,] (K,) and أَشَاوَى, (S, K,)<br>\
with fet-h to the و, (MF, TA,) and it is also<br>\
mentioned as with kesr, (TA,) [and is written in<br>\
both of my copies of the S أَشَاوَى, though if with<br>\
kesr it should be either أَشَاوٍ or أَشَاوِىُّ, but أَشَاوَى<br>\
only is meant by J, as is shown by what here<br>\
follows,] originally أَشَايِىُّ, with three ى s, not<br>\
أَشَائِىُّ as J says, [or rather as the word is written<br>\
in copies of the S, for J may have held it to be<br>\
أَشَائِىُّ or أَشَايِىْءُ, as he says that the ء was changed<br>\
into ى thus occasioning the combination of three<br>\
ىs, so that he held its secondary form to be<br>\
أَشَايِىُّ, as will presently be shown,] because the<br>\
first ى is radical, not augmentative, (IB, K,) the<br>\
medial ى of the three being suppressed, and the<br>\
final one changed into ا [though written ى], and<br>\
the initial one changed into و, (S,) and another<br>\
form of pl. is أَشَايَا, (S, Msb, K,) with the ى<br>\
preserved, not changed into و [as it is in أَشَاوَى],<br>\
(TA,) [likewise] a pl. of أَشْيَآءُ, (Msb,) and أَشَيَايَا<br>\
also is mentioned, (K,) as formed [from أَشْيَآءُ] by<br>\
the change of ء into ى and adding ا, (TA,) and<br>\
أَشَاوِهُ, which is strange, (Lh, K,) as there is no ه<br>\
in أَشَيَآءُ, (Lh,) or in شَىْءٌ: (K:) with respect to<br>\
the first of these forms, [the quasi-pl. n.] أَشَيَآءُ, the<br>\
most probable opinion is that of Kh: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) accord. to him, (S, Msb, K,) it is originally<br>\
of the measure فَعْلَآءُ, (S, K, *) in lieu of أَفْعَالٌ,<br>\
(K,) and therefore imperfectly decl., (S,) [i. e.] it<br>\
is originally شَيْئَآءُ, (Msb,) and the two hemzehs<br>\
combined in the latter portion being found<br>\
difficult of pronunciation, the former of them is<br>\
transposed to the beginning of the word, so that<br>\
it becomes of the measure لَفْعَآءُ, (S, Msb,) as is<br>\
shown by its having for its pls. أَشَاوَى and أَشَايَا<br>\
and أَشْيَاوَاتٌ: (S:) accord. to Akh, it is [originally] of the measure أَفْعِلَآءُ; (S, K;) but if it were<br>\
thus a broken pl., [not a quasi-pl. n.,] its dim.<br>\
would not be ↓ أُشْيَّآءُ, as it is, but شُيَيْآتٌ: (S:)<br>\
accord. to Ks, it is of the measure أَفْعَالٌ, and<br>\
made imperfectly decl. because of frequency of<br>\
usage, being likened to فَعْلَآءُ; but were it so, أَبْنَآء<br>\
and أَسْمَآء would be imperfectly decl.: (S, K:)<br>\
accord. to Fr, شَىْءٌ is originally شَيِّئٌ, and therefore has a pl. of the measure أَفْعِلَآءُ, afterwards<br>\
contracted to فَعْلَآءُ; but were it so, it would not<br>\
have for its pl. أَشَاوَى. (S. [Much more respecting<br>\
this pl. is added in the TA, but it is comparatively<br>\
unprofitable.]) The dim. of شَىْءٌ is ↓ شُيَىْءٌ and<br>\
↓ شِيَىْءٌ; (S, K, TA, but only the former in some<br>\
copies of the K, the word being written in other<br>\
copies شُِيَىْءٌ;) not ↓ شُوَىٌّ, or ↓ شُوَىْءٌ; (the former<br>\
accord. to my two copies of the S and accord. to<br>\
the copies of the K followed in the TA, in which<br>\
it is said to be with teshdeed to the ى, and the<br>\
latter accord. to the CK and my MS. copy of the<br>\
K;) or this is a dial. var. of weak authority, (K,)<br>\
used by post-classical poets in their verses. (MF,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  When a man says to thee, “What dost<br>\
thou desire? ” thou answerest, لَا شَيْئًا [Nothing]:<br>\
and when he says, “Why didst thou that? ” thou<br>\
answerest, لِلَا شَىْءٍ [For nothing]: and when he<br>\
says, “What is thine affair? ” thou answerest,<br>\
لَا شَىْءٌ [Nothing]: it is with tenween in every<br>\
one of these cases. (As, AHát, TA.) [When one<br>\
says لَا شَىْءَ, he means thereby There is nothing.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  لَيْسَ بِشَىْءٍ means [It is nought, of no account<br>\
or weight; it is not worthy of notice, or not worth<br>\
anything;] it is not a good thing; or it is not a<br>\
thing to be regarded. (W p. 27.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [لَيْسَ مِنَ الأَمْرِ<br>\
فِى شَىْءٍ is a phrase of frequent occurrence, meaning He has no concern with the affair; see two<br>\
exs. in the first paragraph of art. حوص. ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
فِيهِ شَىْءٍِ مِنَ الطُّولِ occurs in the TA voce حُسْبَانَةٌ,<br>\
meaning In it is somewhat, or some degree, of<br>\
length; i. e. it is somewhat long; and is used in<br>\
the present day in this sense.] ―<br>\
-b6-  In the phrase<br>\
هُوَ أَحْسَنُ مِنْكَ شَيْئًا, the last word is for بِشَىْءٍ<br>\
[i. e. He is better than thou in something; meaning he is somewhat better than thou]. (IJ, L.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
مَا أَغْفَلَهُ عَنْكَ شَيْئًا is a phrase of the Arabs [app.<br>\
lit. signifying How unmindful of thee is he as to<br>\
anything!] mentioned by Sb as meaning دَعِ الشَّكَّ<br>\
عَنْكَ [Dismiss doubt from thee (respecting him<br>\
as to anything)]: IJ says that شيئا is here put in<br>\
the accus. case as an inf. n., as though the saying<br>\
were مَا أَغْفَلَهُ عَنْكَ غُفُولًا, because the verb of<br>\
wonder does not require to be corroborated by the<br>\
inf. n. [proper to it]: (L, TA:) [or it is a specificative:] IF says that it is a phrase of dubious<br>\
meaning; and that the most probable explanation<br>\
of it is this; that ما is here lit. interrogative, but<br>\
in meaning denotative of wonder; and that شيئا is<br>\
governed in the accus. case by some other word,<br>\
or phrase, as though the saying were dismiss a<br>\
thing by which he is not occupied in mind, and<br>\
dismiss doubt as to his being occupied in mind by<br>\
it. (TA in art. ما.) ―<br>\
-b8-  [شَيْئًا فَشَيْئًا means Thing<br>\
by thing, part by part, bit by bit, piecemeal, inch<br>\
by inch, drop by drop, little and little in succession, by little and little, by degrees or gradually.] ―<br>\
-b9-  أَىُّ شَىْءٍ [meaning What thing?] is,<br>\
by the alleviation of the ى [in اىّ] and the suppression of the ء [in شىء], made into one word,<br>\
أَيْشَىْ: so says El-Fárábee: (Msb:) or, [as is<br>\
commonly the case in the present day,] by reason<br>\
of frequency of usage, it is contracted into أَيْشَ.<br>\
(TA in art. جرم, as on the authority of Ks.) ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
شَىْءٌ in the Kur lx. 11 may mean Any one (Bd,<br>\
Jel) or more. (Jel.) ―<br>\
-b11-  [It is also applied to<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The penis of a man; as in the explanation of a<br>\
phrase mentioned voce ذَنَبٌ; like as its syn. هَنٌ<br>\
is to the same and (more commonly) to the<br>\
“ vulva ” of a woman.] ―<br>\
-b12-  In algebra, it signifies<br>\
[A square root;] a number that is multiplied into<br>\
itself; which in arithmetic [and in algebra also] is<br>\
called جذر [i. e. جَذْرٌ]; and in geometry, ضلع<br>\
[i. e. ضِلْعٌ or ضِلَعٌ]; (“ Dict. of the Techn. Terms<br>\
used in the Sciences of the Musalmans,” p. 202;)<br>\
an unknown number that is multiplied into itself.<br>\
(Idem, p. 730.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also said, on the authority<br>\
of Lth, to signify Water: and he cites as an ex.,<br>\
تَرَى رَكْبَهُ بِالشَّىْءِ فِى وَسْطِ قَفْرَةٍ<br>\
[Thou seest, or wilt see, his company of riders at<br>\
the water in the midst of a desert]: but AM says,<br>\
I know not الشىء in the sense of “ water,” nor<br>\
know I what it is. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  يَا شَىْءَ is an expression of regret, (El-Ahmar, Ks, TA,) or of<br>\
wonder, (K, TA,) [or of both,] meaning [Oh! or]<br>\
O my wonder! (Ks, Lh, TA.) One says, يَا شَىْءَ<br>\
مَا لِى, (El-Ahmar, Ks, Lh, K,) and يَا شَىَّ مَا لِى,<br>\
i. e. with and without ء, (Ks, TA,) and يَا هَىْءَ مَا<br>\
لِى, (Lh, K,) يا هَىَّ ما لى, and يَا فَىَّ ما لى,<br>\
(El-Ahmar, Ks, TA,) neither of these two with<br>\
ء, (Ks, TA,) [meaning Oh! or O my wonder!<br>\
What has happened to me?] in all of these, (Ks,<br>\
TA,) ما being in the place of a noun in the nom.<br>\
case. (Ks, Lh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Some also say, يَا شَىْءَ<br>\
and يَا هَىَّ and يَا فَىَّ, and some add مَا, saying,<br>\
يَا شَىْءَ مَا and يَا هَىَّ مَا and يَا فَىَّ مَا, meaning<br>\
How good, or beautiful, is this! (Ks, TA.)<br>\
شِيْئَةٌ [Will, wish, or desire,] a subst. from شَآءَهُ,<br>\
(Lh, K,) [and] so is ↓ مَشِيْئَةٌ [which is mentioned<br>\
in the K as an inf. n.]. (Msb.) One says, كُلُّ<br>\
شَىْءٍ بِشِيْئَةِ اللّٰهِ, (S, K,) i. e. ↓ بَمِشِيْئَتِهِ [Everything<br>\
is by the will of God]. (S.)<br>\
شُيَىْءٌ and شِيَىْءٌ and شُوَىٌّ or شُوَىْءٌ: see شَىْءٌ<br>\
in the middle of the paragraph.<br>\
شَيِّآنٌ and شَيَّآنٌ: see art. شوأ.<br>\
أُشَيَّآءُ dim. of أَشْيَآءُ: see شَىْءٌ, in the latter part<br>\
of the former half of the paragraph.<br>\
مَشِيْئَةٌ: see شِيْئَةٌ, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also<br>\
شَىْءٌ, near the beginning of the paragraph.<br>\
مُشَيَّأٌ Incongruous, unsound, (K, TA,) foul, or<br>\
ugly, (TA,) in make, or formation. (K, TA. [See<br>\
Ham p. 192.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed,<br>\
A child born preposterously, the legs coming forth<br>\
before the arms. (TA.)<br>\
