شَلَّتْ يَمِينُهُ, (S, O,) or يَدُهُ, (Mgh, TA,) or<br>\
اليَدُ, (Msb, K,) originally شَلِلَتْ, (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA,) aor. تَشَلُّ, (S, O, &amp;c.,) inf. n. شَلَلٌ (S, * O, *<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K) and شَلٌّ, (Msb, K,) or the latter<br>\
is not allowable; (Ham p. 69;) this is the chaste<br>\
form of the verb; (Th, TA;) and ↓ أُشِلَّتْ; (Th,<br>\
K;) and شُلَّتْ, (Th, O, K,) but this last is bad,<br>\
(Th, O, TA,) and is disallowed by Fr; (TA;)<br>\
His right hand or arm, or his hand or arm, or<br>\
the hand or arm, was, or became, unsound, or<br>\
vitiated: (S, O, TA:) or deprived of the power of<br>\
motion by an unsound, or a vitiated, state of its<br>\
عُرُوق [meaning veins or nerves]: (Msb:) or<br>\
dried up; or stiff: or it went [or wasted] away.<br>\
(K, TA.) One says, in praying for a person,<br>\
لَا تَشْلَلْ يَدُكَ [May thy hand, or arm, not become<br>\
unsound, &amp;c.]: (S, Msb, * K: *) and لَا شَلَلًا and<br>\
↓ لَا شَلَالِ, which mean the same; the last word<br>\
like قَطَامِ. (K.) And شَلَّ عَشْرُهُ, and خَمْسُهُ, [His<br>\
ten fingers became unsound, &amp;c., and his five<br>\
fingers,] and some say شَلَّتْ, but this is more<br>\
rare; i. e., the suppression of the fem. ت is more<br>\
usual in a case of this kind. (Lh, TA.) To one<br>\
who has shot or thrown, or who has pierced or<br>\
thrust, well, one says, لَا شَلَلًا وَلَا عَمًى [Mayest<br>\
thou not experience unsoundness, &amp;c., nor blindness]; and لَا شَلَّ عَشْرُكَ [May thy ten fingers not<br>\
become unsound, &amp;c.], meaning أَصَابِعُكَ. (S, O.)<br>\
He who says شَلَّ المَارِنُ and شَلَّتِ الأُذُنُ is a<br>\
foreigner. (Mgh.) The lawyers [improperly] use<br>\
الشَّلَل in relation to the ذَكَر. (Msb.) One says<br>\
also, شَلِلْتَ يَا رَجُلُ [Thou hast become unsound,<br>\
&amp;c., in thy hand or thine arm, O man]. (S, O.)<br>\
And لَا شَلَلَ, meaning لَا تَشْلَلْ, because it occupies the place of an imperative. (Lth, TA.) In<br>\
the saying of the rájiz, (S,) namely, Abu-l-Khudree<br>\
El-Yarboo&#39;ee, (O, TA,)<br>\
مُهْرَ أَبِى الجَبْحَابِ لَا تَشَلِّى<br>\
[Colt of Abu-l-Habháb, mayest thou not become<br>\
unsound, &amp;c., in the fore leg], (S, TA, [in the O,<br>\
ابى الحَرِثِ, for ابى الحٰرِثِ,]) the last word is<br>\
thus [for لا تَشْلَلْ] on account of the rhyme: (S,<br>\
O, TA:) [for] the next hemistich is<br>\
بَارَكَ فِيكَ اللّٰهُ مِنْ ذِى أَلِّ<br>\
[God bless thee as one possessing fleetness, or<br>\
swiftness]; (O, TA;) ذى الّ in this instance<br>\
meaning ذى سُرْعَةٍ. (S in art. ال.)<br>\
-A2-  شَلَّهُ; (K;)<br>\
and شَلَلْتُ الإِبِلَ, (S, O,) and الرَّجُلَ; (Msb;)<br>\

شَلُ3َ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. شَلٌّ (S, O, Msb, K *)<br>\
and شَلَلٌ, (K, * and Ksh in xii. 3,) like as قَصَصٌ<br>\
is inf. n. of قَصَّ, (Ksh ibid.,) or شَلَلٌ is a simple<br>\
subst.; (S, O;) He drove him away; (K;) and<br>\
I drove away (S, O, Msb) the camels, (S, O,)<br>\
and the man. (Msb.) And مَرَّ فُلَانٌ يَشُلُّهُمْ بِالسَّيْفِ<br>\
Such a one passed along urging them on, and<br>\
driving them, with the sword. (S.) [See also 4.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,] الصُّبْحُ يَشُلُّ الظَّلَامَ (tropical:)  The dawn drives<br>\
away the darkness. (TA.) ―<br>\

aor.<br>\

coat of mail; on the authority of ISh. (O, TA.)<br>\

(O,) I sewed the garment, or piece of cloth, (S, O,<br>\
Msb, TA,) slightly; (S, O, TA; [omitted, probably by inadvertence, in my copy of the Msb;])<br>\
[previously to the second sewing termed الكَفُّ;]<br>\
strangely omitted in the K: ↓ شِلَالَةٌ is [app. a<br>\
subst., not an inf. n., signifying The act, or art, of<br>\
so sewing;] the contr. of كِفَافَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\

waste] away: (K:) or اشلّ اليَدَ He (i. e. God)<br>\
made the hand or arm to become deprived of the<br>\
power of motion by an unsound, or a vitiated,<br>\
state of its عُرُوق [meaning veins or nerves].<br>\
(Msb.) And اشلّ اللّٰه يَدَهُ is said by way of<br>\
imprecation [as meaning May God render his<br>\
hand or arm unsound, &amp;c.]. (O.) See also 1,<br>\
first sentence.<br>\
-A2-  [It is said that] إِشْلَالٌ signifies<br>\
