شَوِىَ, TA,) inf. n. شَىٌّ, (S,<br>\
MA, Msb, K,) He roasted, broiled, or fried, the<br>\
flesh-meat; (MA, KL, * PS;) and ↓ اشواهُ signifies the same; as also ↓ اشتواهُ; (Msb, TA;) or<br>\

MA, * TA,) شِوَآء, (S, TA, *) or roasted, broiled, or<br>\
fried, flesh-meat. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And شَوَى المَآءَ,<br>\
(IAar, K,) aor. as above, (TA,) He heated the<br>\
water. (IAar, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And accord. to Freytag,<br>\
شَوَى signifies also He cut off from (من) roasted<br>\
flesh-meat: but for this he has named no authority.]<br>\
-A2-  See also 4.<br>\
2<br>\
شَوَّىَ see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also شوّاهُ لَحْمًا He gave him<br>\
flesh-meat [app. in an unrestricted sense]. (TA.)<br>\

4<br>\
اشوى اللَّحْمَ: see 1. ―<br>\

K;) and ↓ شَوَّاهُمْ, inf. n. تَشْوِيَةٌ; (K;) He fed<br>\
them with شِوَآء [i. e. roasted, or broiled, or fried,<br>\
flesh-meat]. (S, Msb, K.) And (both verbs with<br>\
their complements) He gave them flesh-meat that<br>\
they might roast, or broil, or fry, thereof. (AZ,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A2-  And اشوى (tropical:)  He left a portion remaining<br>\
of his supper: (S, K, TA:) or he left some roasted,<br>\
or broiled, or fried, flesh-meat of his supper. (A,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And اشوى القَمْحُ The wheat became fit<br>\
to be rubbed with the hands and to be roasted.<br>\
(ISd, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اشوى السَّعَفُ (assumed tropical:)  The palmbranches became yellow on the occasion of their<br>\

-A4-<br>\
اشواهُ said of a shooter or caster, He hit (S, *<br>\
Msb, * K) his شَوَى, (K,) i. e. [one or more of his]<br>\
extremities, (TA,) not a [vital] place where a<br>\
wound would occasion death; (S, Msb, K;) and<br>\
so ↓ شَوَاهُ, as in the Tekmileh: in the K, erroneously, شوّاهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, He missed it,<br>\
i. e. the object of his aim. See مُشْوًى: and see<br>\

says that اشوى is allowable in the sense of أَسْقَطَ<br>\

like أَسْوَى [q. v.]. (TA in art. سوى.)<br>\
-A5-  In the<br>\
saying مَا أَعْيَاهُ وَأَشْيَاهُ (S, K, [in some copies of<br>\
the K وَمَا أَشْيَاهُ,]) and so in ما اعياه وَأَشْوَاهُ, (S, *<br>\
K, * TA,) the latter verb is an imitative sequent<br>\
to the former [added only for the purpose of<br>\
corroboration]. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انشوى اللَّحْمُ The flesh-meat became roasted,<br>\

شَاةٌ: see what next follows: and see more in<br>\
art. شوه.<br>\
شِيَةٌ i. q. شَآءٌ [q. v. in art. شوه]; as also ↓ شَوِىٌّ;<br>\
(IAar, K;) the latter is like غَنِىٌّ, [الشَّوٰى in the<br>\
CK as syn. with الشّاءُ being a mistranscription,]<br>\
and is said by IAth to be a quasi-pl. n., or [what<br>\
lexicographers term] a pl., of ↓ شَاةٌ [n. un. of<br>\
شَآءٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
شِىٌّ is originally شِوْىٌ. (ISd, TA.) One says,<br>\
جَآءَ بِالعِىِّ وَالشِّىِّ, (S, K,) using the latter noun as<br>\
an imitative sequent to the former [for the purpose<br>\
of corroboration: see art. عى]. (TA.)<br>\
شَوًى is pl. of شَوَاةٌ: [or rather the former is a<br>\
coll. gen. n. of which the latter is the n. un.:] the<br>\
latter signifies The skin of the head: (S, TA:) so<br>\
[accord. to some] in the Kur lxx. 16: (TA:) or<br>\
the exterior of the skin of the head, in which<br>\
grows the hair: (Aboo-Safwán, TA in art. بشر:)<br>\
and some say, the exterior of all, or of any part,<br>\
of the skin: (TA in the present art.:) and the<br>\
former signifies the arms or hands and the legs<br>\
or feet, or the fore and hind legs, (S, K,) and (K)<br>\
the extremities (Msb, K) collectively, (K,) and<br>\
the head of a human being, (S,) or the قِحْف of<br>\
the head [i. e. the bone above the brain, or a<br>\
separate portion of the skull, or a distinct bone of<br>\
the skull], (K,) but of a horse the legs, not the<br>\
head, because one says عَبْلُ الشَّوَى [i. e. thick in<br>\
the legs], for this cannot relate to the head of the<br>\
horse, (S,) and any part that is not a [vital]<br>\
place [i. e.] where a wound causes death (S, Msb,<br>\
K) such [for instance] as the legs. (Msb.)<br>\
ثَالِبَةُ الشَّوَى means A woman having cracked, or<br>\
chapped, feet. (S and K in art. ثلب.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is<br>\
also a subst. [app. meaning a quasi-inf. n.] from<br>\
أَشْوَاهُ [q. v.] as said of a shooter or caster: (TA:)<br>\
[and hence] the saying (S, TA) of the Hudhalee,<br>\
(S, [accord. to the TA, Khálid Ibn-Zuheyr,])<br>\
فَإِنَّ مِنَ القَوْلِ الَّتِى لَا شَوَى لَهَا<br>\
إِذَا زَلَّ ظَهْرِ اللِّسَانِ انْفِلَاتُهُ<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  [And, or for] verily of speech is that<br>\
sentence (كَلِمَة, a word understood,) which does<br>\
not hit a place where a wound will not occasion<br>\
death, [i. e. which does not miss its object, when<br>\
its escaping from the upper surface of the tongue<br>\
is quick,] but which kills. (S, TA.) And شَوًى<br>\
is used [app. in like manner, as a quasi-inf. n.,]<br>\
in the case of anything that has missed an object<br>\
of aim, though there be to it [really] no place<br>\
where a wound would occasion death nor anything that is [properly] termed شَوًى [as meaning<br>\
a place where a wound will not occasion death].<br>\
(TA.) And [hence] it signifies (assumed tropical:)  A mistake; syn.<br>\
خَطَأٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  A thing, (S,) or an affair,<br>\
(K,) that is paltry, mean, despicable, or of no<br>\
account or weight or worth: (S, K, * TA:) in<br>\
this sense, from the same word as signifying the<br>\
“ extremities ” [of an animal]. (IAth, TA.) Hence,<br>\
in a trad. of Mujáhid, كُلُّ مَا أَصَابَ الصَّائِمَ شَوًى<br>\
إِلَّا الغَيْبَةَ (tropical:)  [Everything that befalls the faster<br>\
is a matter of no account, except absence of mind];<br>\
i. e. nothing that befalls the faster annuls his fast<br>\
except الغيبة, for this does annul it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And (assumed tropical:)  The worse, or viler, sort of cattle, (S, K,<br>\
TA,) of camels, and of sheep or goats; and the<br>\
small, or young, thereof. (TA.) [See also شُوَايَةٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  A remainder, or remaining portion.<br>\
(TA.) [See, again, شُوَايَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b6-  Also i. q. إِبْقَآءٌ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The making, or causing, or suffering, to remain; or, perhaps, to continue in life, and if it<br>\
mean thus, it may be from the same word in a<br>\
sense expl. above, for the animal that one hits in<br>\
a part that is not vital is suffered to continue in<br>\
life]. (TA.)<br>\
شُوَآءٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
شِوَآءٌ Roasted, broiled, or fried, flesh-meat; (S, *<br>\
MA, Msb, K, * KL;) as also ↓ شُوَآءٌ; (Ks, Sgh,<br>\
K;) but the former is more usual and more<br>\
chaste: (TA:) a subst. from شَوَى اللَّحْمَ: and<br>\
↓ شِوَآءَةٌ [as its n. un.] signifies a piece thereof. (S.)<br>\
شَوِىٌّ (K) and ↓ مَشْوِىٌّ (Msb) [Roasted,<br>\
broiled, or fried], the latter originally مَشْوُوىٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) [In the K the former is said to be like<br>\
شِوَآءٌ; but it has the signification of the latter, i. e.,<br>\
of a pass. part. n.]<br>\
-A2-  See also شِيَةٌ.<br>\
-A3-  Ks says,<br>\
(S,) in the phrase عَيِىٌّ شَيِىٌّ, and so in عَيِىٌّ شَوِىٌّ,<br>\
(S, K,) some say (S) the latter word is an<br>\
imitative sequent to the former [i. e. a corroborative: see art. عى]. (S, K.)<br>\
شِوَآءَةٌ: see شِوَآءٌ.<br>\
شَوِيَّةٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
شَوَايَةٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
شُوَايَةٌ What is cut off from, or of, flesh-meat:<br>\
(K, TA:) or what the slaughterer cuts off from,<br>\
or of, the extremities of a sheep or goat. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  A small thing [or portion] of that which is<br>\
large; as a piece, or detached portion, of a sheep,<br>\
or goat: one says, مَا بَقِىَ مِنَ الشَّاةِ إِلَّا شُوَايَةٌ<br>\
[There remained not of the sheep, or goat, save a<br>\
piece]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (S, K,) and ↓ شِوَايَةٌ and<br>\
↓ شَوَايَةٌ, (K,) A قُرْص [or round cake, or small<br>\
round cake,] of bread. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And, all the<br>\
three, A remaining portion of people, or of cattle,<br>\
that have perished; as also ↓ شَوِيَّةٌ; (K;) or this<br>\
last, a remaining portion of people that have<br>\
perished: (S:) pl. (of the last, S) شَوَايَا. (S, K.)<br>\
[See also شَوًى.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And (tropical:)  The bad, or vile, sort,<br>\
(K, TA,) or worse, or viler, sort, (TA,) of camels,<br>\
and of sheep, or goats: (K, TA:) in this sense<br>\
written by ISd with kesr and with fet-h. (TA.)<br>\
[See, again, شَوًى.] ―<br>\
-b6-  [And accord. to Freytag,<br>\
شواية الرضف (i. e. شوايةُ الرَّضْفِ) is expl. by Meyd<br>\
as meaning Cooked milk cast upon a hot stone, so<br>\
that only a small portion remains.]<br>\
شِوَايَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
شَوَّآءٌ A seller of roasted, broiled, or fried, flesh-meat. (KL.)<br>\
