شَقَحَ النَّخْلُ, and ↓ شقّح, The palm-trees<br>\
were, or became, goodly with their fruit. (TA.)<br>\
[See also 4.]<br>\
-A2-  شَقَحَ اللّٰهُ فُلَانًا, [inf. n. شَقْحٌ,]<br>\
accord. to AZ, is syn. with قَبَحَهُ اللّٰهُ [i. e. God<br>\
removed such a one far from good, or prosperity,<br>\
&amp;c.; or may God remove &amp;c.]: (TA:) [or, as<br>\
may be inferred from what follows, the former of<br>\
these verbs is used by some as an imitative sequent to the latter of them:] and accord. to Sb,<br>\
(TA,) شَقُحَ, (K, TA,) inf. n. [شُقْحٌ and] شَقَاحَةٌ,<br>\
(TA,) is syn. with قَبُحَ [i. e. He, or it, was, or<br>\
became, bad or evil, foul or ugly, &amp;c.]: (K, TA:)<br>\
[but in this case also it seems that the former of<br>\
these verbs may be used by some as an imitative<br>\
sequent to the latter of them: for] one says,<br>\
قَبْحًا لَهُ وَشَقْحًا [May removal far from good, or<br>\
prosperity, &amp;c., betide him], (S, O, K,) in which<br>\
شَقْحًا is an imitative sequent to قَبْحًا, or syn.<br>\
therewith; (S, K;) and [in like manner] قُبْحًا<br>\
لَهُ وَشُقْحًا; (O, K;) and, of a man, قَبُح وَشَقُحَ,<br>\
inf. n. of the latter as above and in like manner of<br>\
the former; (S;) and جَآءَ بِالقَبَاحَةِ وَالشَّقَاحَةِ [He<br>\
did, or said, what was bad or evil, &amp;c.]: (K:)<br>\
and ↓ هُوَ قَبِيحٌ شَقِيحٌ [He is bad or evil, foul or<br>\
ugly, &amp;c.]: (S, * O, K: *) and ↓ قَعَدَ مَقْبُوحًا مَشْقُوحًا<br>\
[He sat, or remained, far removed from good, or<br>\
prosperity, &amp;c.]: in like manner: (K:) but Sb<br>\
intimates that ↓ شَقيِحٌ is not an imitative sequent,<br>\
by his stating that the Arabs say شَقِيحٌ وَذَمِيمٌ<br>\
[Bad, or evil, &amp;c., and blamed, &amp;c.; or, more<br>\
probably, شَقِيحٌ وَدَمِيمٌ, meaning foul and ugly]:<br>\
(L, TA:) and [it is said that] ↓ شَقِيحٌ signifies<br>\
Recovering (نَاقِهٌ [for which Freytag appears to<br>\
have read نَاقَة]) from disease; (O, K, TA;) and<br>\
hence one says, فُلَانٌ قَبِيحٌ شَقِيحٌ [as though<br>\
meaning Such a one is unsightly, being just<br>\
recovering from disease]: (TA:) and accord. to<br>\
AZ, ↓ مَشْقَوحٌ is [not an imitative sequent, but]<br>\
syn. with مَقْبُوحٌ: (L, TA:) in the phrase abovementioned, مَشْقُوحًا is said in the &#39;Ináyeh to mean<br>\
broken: or far removed: (TA:) or it means<br>\
reviled. (O.)<br>\
-A3-  [As indicated above,] شَحَقَهُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
شَقَحَ, (Lh, O, K,) inf. n. شَقْحٌ, (Lh, O,) also<br>\
signifies He broke it. (Lh, O, K.) One says,<br>\
لَأَشْقَحَنَّكَ شَقْحَ الجَوْزَةِ بِالجَنْدَلِ, i. e. I will assuredly break [or crush] thee [as in the breaking<br>\
of the walnut] with stones: (O, TA: *) or I will<br>\
assuredly extract all that thou hast [as in the<br>\
extracting of the contents of the walnut by<br>\
means of stones]: for شَقَحَ الجَوْزَةَ, inf. n. as<br>\
above, means He extracted what was in the<br>\
walnut. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
شَقَّحَ see 1, first sentence: and see also 4, in three<br>\
places.<br>\

شاقحهُ He reviled him; or contended with<br>\
him in reviling; (K, TA;) and contended with<br>\
him in annoyance. (O, TA.)<br>\

أَزْهَى [meaning The palm-trees showed redness, or<br>\
yellowness, in their fruit]: (S, A, O, K:) or their<br>\
dates became altered from greenness to yellowness:<br>\
(Mgh:) the former is said by As to be of the<br>\
dial. of El-Hijáz: and ↓ the latter verb is also<br>\
said of the [kind of tree called] أَرَاك, meaning it<br>\
became coloured in its fruit. (TA.) And اشقح<br>\
التَّمْرُ, (O,) or البُسْرُ, (K,) inf. n. إِشْقَاحٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ شقّح, (O, K,) inf. n. as above; (TA;) The<br>\
dates, or the unripe dates, became coloured, (O,<br>\
K,) red, or yellow: (O, TA:) or, as some say,<br>\
became sweet. (TA.) The Prophet forbade the<br>\
selling of dates before their becoming in this<br>\
state. (S, * A, * O, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اشقحهُ He removed<br>\
him far away. (O, K. *)<br>\
-A3-  أَقْبِحْ بِهِ وَأَشْقِحْ [app.<br>\
How foul, or ugly, or the like, is he! as seems to<br>\
be shown by what here follows]: IDrd cites,<br>\
أَقْبِحْ بِهِ مِنْ وَلَدٍ وَأَشْقِحْ<br>\
مِثْلُ جُرَىِّ الكَلْبِ لَا بَلْ أَقْبَحْ<br>\
[How foul is he, as offspring, and how ugly!<br>\
like the little whelp of the dog; nay, rather, more<br>\
foul!]. (O.)<br>\
شُقْحٌ [and inf. n. of شَقُحَ, q. v. ―<br>\
-b2-  And,] accord.<br>\
to AZ, i. q. شُحٌّ [i. e. Niggardliness, &amp;c.; or the<br>\

شُقْحَةٌ and ↓ شَقْحَةٌ An unripe date altering in<br>\
redness, (K,) or altered to redness. (As, TA.) ―<br>\

And the former signifies The [ruddy] colour<br>\
termed شُقْرَة. (O, K.)<br>\
حُلَّةٌ شُقَحِيَّةٌ A red [dress, or garment, such as<br>\
is termed] حُلَّة: (K:) the latter word being a<br>\
rel. n. from شُقْحَةٌ meaning “ an unripe date<br>\
altering to redness. ” (TA.)<br>\
