youth, or young man; i. e. he attained to the<br>\
state termed شَبَابٌ meaning as expl. below; (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) said of a boy. (S, Msb.) [And<br>\
in like manner شَبَّتْ is said of a girl, i. e. She<br>\
became a young woman.] ―<br>\
-b2-  شُبَّ used as a noun:<br>\
see below. ―<br>\
-b3-  [Perhaps as an inf. n. of which the<br>\
verb is شَبَّ, (as Freytag has assumed,) but more<br>\
probably of شُبَّ, which will be found mentioned<br>\
in this paragraph, for I do not find the former<br>\
verb in the requisite sense,] شَبٌّ signifies Anything&#39;s being, or becoming, raised, or elevated.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\

in art. شبو, said of a mare.]) And likewise He<br>\
was or became, restive, or refractory: one says,<br>\
برِئْتُ إِلَيْكَ مِنْ شِبَابِهِ and شَبِيبِهِ and عِضَاضِهِ and<br>\
عَضِيضِهِ [I am irresponsible to thee for his being<br>\
restive, or refractory, and for his biting]. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  شَبَّتِ النَّارُ, [aor., accord. to rule,<br>\
شَبِ3َ,] (Msb,<br>\
K,) and شُبَّت [pass. of the trans. verb شَبَّ, q. v.<br>\

شَبُ3َ, (S, O, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\

تَشْبِيبٌ; (L;) and ↓ اشبّها: (A and TA in art.<br>\
حش:) and so شَبَاهَا. (TA in art. شبو.) And in<br>\
like manner, شَبَّ الحَرْبَ (assumed tropical:)  He kindled war, or<br>\
the war; or made it to burn, or burn fiercely.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] شَبَّ, aor.<br>\
شَبُ3َ, said of the blackness of a garment, (Sh, A, TA,) (tropical:)  It heightened<br>\
and increased, (A,) or made to appear bright<br>\
and beautiful, and [as it were] burning, or glowing, (Sh, TA,) the whiteness of the wearer. (Sh,<br>\
A, TA.) And شَبَّ لَوْنَهَا (aor. as above, S) (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
(a woman&#39;s hair) showed, [or set off,] and rendered beautiful, her colour, or complexion: (S:)<br>\
it (a woman&#39;s head-covering, and her hair,) increased, and showed, [or heightened, and set off,]<br>\

her beautiful. (TA.) And يَشُبُّ الوَجْهَ, said of<br>\

شبّب النَّارَ, inf. n. تَشْبِيبٌ: see the preceding<br>\
paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, تَشْبِيبُ الشِّعْرِ (tropical:)  The making<br>\
the commencement of poetry elegant, or ornate,<br>\
by the mention of women: (L, TA:) or the primary meaning of التَّشْبِيبُ is the mention of the<br>\
days of youth and of play or sport, and amatory<br>\
language; and it is in the commencing of odes;<br>\
and the commencement thereof is so called, absolutely, though there be not in it any mention of<br>\
youth: (TA:) it means النَّسِيبُ, (S, O,) or<br>\
النَّسِيبُ بِالنِّسَآءِ, (K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
التَّشَبُّبُ بالنِساءِ,]) i. e. بِذِكْرِهِنَّ: (TA:) one says,<br>\
يُشَبِّبُ بِقُلَانَةَ, (S, O,) and بِهَا ↓ يتشبّب [if this be<br>\
not a mistranscription for يُشَبِّبُ], (TA,) meaning<br>\
يَنْسِبُ بِهَا: (S, O, TA:) [see this fully expl. in<br>\
art. نسب: i. e.] شبّب بِفُلَانَةَ, inf. n. تَشْبِيبٌ,<br>\
means, (tropical:)  He spoke of such a female in amatory<br>\
language [in the commencement of his ode],<br>\
(Msb, TA,) and alluded to the love of her:<br>\
(Msb:) and شبّب قَصِيدَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He embellished [the<br>\
commencement of] his ode by the mention of<br>\
women: (Mgh, Msb:) and شبّب قَصِيدَتَهُ بِفُلَانَةَ<br>\
(tropical:)  [He embellished the commencement of his ode by<br>\
mentioning, in amatory language, such a female]:<br>\
(A, TA:) and ↓ شَبَابٌ is used in the sense of<br>\
تَشْبِيبٌ; thus a قَصِيدَة is said to be حَسَنَةٌ الشَّبَابِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Beautiful in the mention of women &amp;c.]; and<br>\
Jereer is said to have been أَرَقُّ النَّاسِ شَبَابًا (tropical:)  [The<br>\
most elegant of men in the mention of women &amp;c.].<br>\
(A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence, i. e. from تَشْبِيبٌ القَصِيدَةِ, may<br>\
be derived التَّشْبِيبُ as a conventional term in the<br>\
science of the division of inheritances; meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The mention of daughters according to the<br>\
different degrees [of descent]: (Mgh:) it is as<br>\
when one says, “he died, and left three daughters<br>\
of a son, subordinate one to another, and three<br>\
daughters of a son&#39;s son, in like manner, and<br>\
three daughters of a son&#39;s son&#39;s son, in like<br>\
manner, and the sons died and the daughters<br>\
remained. ” (O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  تَشْبِيبُ الكُتُبِ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
commencing of books, or writings: and hence<br>\
شَبَّبَ يُجَاوِبُهُ, occurring in a trad., meaning (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
commenced answering him: not from the تَشْبِيب<br>\
of women in poetry. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اشبّهُ اللّٰهُ God made him, or may God make<br>\
him, to become a youth, or young man; i. e.,<br>\
to attain to the state termed شَبَابٌ meaning as<br>\
expl. below: and اشبّ اللّٰهُ قَرْنَهُ means the same:<br>\
(S, A, TA:) the latter [lit. means God made, or<br>\
may God make, his equal in age to become a<br>\
youth, &amp;c., (see Har p. 572,) and therefore] is<br>\
tropical. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَشْبَيْتُ الفَرَسَ I excited the<br>\
horse to be brisk, lively, or sprightly, and to raise<br>\
his fore legs together, as though in leaping, and<br>\
to play. (S, * K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اشبّ النَّارَ: see 1. ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
أُشِبَّ لِىَ الرَّجُلُ, inf. n. إِشْبَابٌ; as also ↓ شُبَّ; (tropical:)  The<br>\
man appeared before my upraised eyes when not<br>\
hoped for. (AZ, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And أُشِبَّ لِى كَذَا, and<br>\
↓ شُبَّ, (tropical:)  Such a thing was prepared, or appointed,<br>\
or ordained, for me. (S, K, * TA.)<br>\
-A2-  أَشَبُّ (tropical:)  He<br>\
became one whose child, or children, had attained<br>\
to the state of شَبَاب [i. e. youth, or young manhood, &amp;c.]: (K:) [or] أَشَبَّ الرَّجُلُ بَنِينَ (tropical:)  the man<br>\
became one whose children had attained to that<br>\
state: (S, TA:) and in like manner, أَشَبَّتْ أَوْلَادًا<br>\
is said of a woman. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And أَشَبَّ said of<br>\
[the species of bovine antelope called] the wild<br>\
bull, (S, K,) He became such as is termed شَبَبٌ<br>\
[q. v.], i. e., (S,) he became advanced in age, or<br>\
full-grown; (مُسِنّ, S, K;) one whose state termed<br>\
إِسْنَان [q. v.] had ended. (S.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَشَبَّ3َ [تَشَبَّتِ النَّارُ The fire became kindled; or<br>\
made to burn, burn up, burn brightly or fiercely,<br>\
blaze, or flame: see also 1.] One says on the<br>\
occasion of kindling fire,<br>\
تَشَبَّبِى تَشَبُّبَ النَّمِيمَهْ<br>\
جَآءَتْ بِهَا تَمْرٌ إِلَى تَمِيمَهْ<br>\
[Be thou kindled like the state of kindling of the<br>\
calumny that Temr brought to Temeemeh: but<br>\
to what this alludes I know not]: it is like the<br>\
saying, أَوْقَدَ بِالنَّمِيمَةِ نَارًا [He kindled a fire with<br>\
calumny]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2.<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَشْبَ3َ It is said in a trad., يَجُوزُ شَهَادَةُ الصِّبْيَانِ<br>\
عَلَى الكِبَارِ يُسْتَثَبُّونَ [The boy&#39;s giving testimony<br>\
against those that are full grown is allowable,<br>\
when they (the former) are deemed to have<br>\
attained to the state of youths, or young men]:<br>\
it is as though it were said that if they take upon<br>\
themselves the bearing witness in boyhood, and<br>\
give their testimony when full grown, it is allowable: (TA:) or يُسْتَشَبُّونَ means they shall be<br>\
sought youths, such as have attained to puberty,<br>\
or maturity, in the case of giving testimony: or<br>\
they shall be waited for, in the case of giving<br>\
testimony, until the period of becoming youths,<br>\
or young men. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And it is said in<br>\
another trad., اِسْتَشِبُّوا عَلَى أَسْوُقِكُمْ فِى البَوْلِ, i. e.<br>\
Sit upon your shanks as one does when preparing<br>\
to rise, not stooping with the whole body near to<br>\
the ground; [having your feet only upon the<br>\
ground; in the voiding of urine:] from شَبَّ<br>\
الفَرَسُ meaning “ the horse raised his fore-legs<br>\
together from the ground. ” (TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
شَبْشَبَ He completed [a thing]; (AA,<br>\
O, K;) said of a man. (AA, TA.)<br>\
شَبٌّ, and its fem. شَبَّةٌ: see شَابٌّ.<br>\
-A2-  Also The stones<br>\
of زَاج [or vitriol]: (K:) or the stones from which<br>\
زاج and the like thereof are obtained; the best<br>\
whereof is that which is brought from El-Yemen,<br>\
which is white شبّ, and is very glistening: (TA:)<br>\
[but شَبٌّ يَمَانِىٌّ, as also شَبٌّ alone, is a name now<br>\
commonly given to alum:] or it is a certain<br>\
thing resembling زاج: (S, Msb:) or a species<br>\
thereof: accord. to El-Fárábee, the stones from<br>\
which come زاج and the like: Az says, it is one<br>\
of the minerals produced by God in the earth,<br>\
with which one tans, and resembling زاج, and the<br>\
name [correctly] heard is thus, with ب, but is by<br>\
some mistranscribed with the three-dotted ث,<br>\
[i. e. شَثٌّ,] which is a kind of tree of bitter taste,<br>\
and I know not whether one tans with it or not:<br>\
accord. to Mtr, in the saying that one tans with<br>\
شبّ, this word is a mistranscription; for شبّ is a<br>\
dye, and one does not tan with a dye; it is mistranscribed for شَثّ, which is a kind of tree like<br>\
the dwarf apple-tree, whereof the leaves are like<br>\
those of the خِلَاف [q. v.], and with them one<br>\
tans: El-Fárábee also says, in the section of ث,<br>\
that the شَثّ is a species of mountain-tree, with<br>\
which one tans: from all which it appears that<br>\
one tans with both of them; for an affirmation is<br>\
to be preferred to a negation: (Msb:) and it is a<br>\
well-known medicine; (K, TA;) as some say:<br>\
so accord. to the correct copies of the K, in some of<br>\
which, دَآءٌ is put for دَوَآءٌ. (TA.)<br>\
شُبّ and دُبّ, though originally verbs, are used<br>\
as nouns, by the introduction of مِنْ before them:<br>\
one says, أَعْيَيْتَنِى مِنْ شُبَّ إِلَى دُبَّ and مِنْ شُبّ ٍ<br>\
إِلَى دُبّ ٍ [expl. in art. دبَ]: (S:) and in like<br>\
manner they are used in another saying expl. in<br>\
art. دب [q. v.]: (S in that art.:) or, without<br>\
tenween, they may be regarded as verbs used in<br>\
the way of حِكَايَة [or imitation]. (MF.)<br>\
شَبَّةٌ The burning, burning up, burning brightly<br>\
or fiercely, blazing, or flaming, of fire. (TA.)<br>\
شَبَبٌ and ↓ شَبُوبٌ, applied to a [bovine antelope<br>\
of the species called the] wild bull, (As, S, K,)<br>\
and to a sheep or goat, (K,) and ↓ مُشِبٌّ, applied<br>\
to the former, and ↓ مِشَبٌّ, (As, S, K,) sometimes, applied to the former, (As, S,) or to both,<br>\
(K,) Advanced in age, or full-grown, (مُسِنٌّ, S,<br>\
K,) whose state termed إِسْنَان [q. v.] has ended;<br>\
(As, S;) and ↓ مُشِبَّةٌ is in like manner applied to<br>\
a she-camel as meaning مُسِنَّةٌ: (TA:) or ↓ شبُوبٌ,<br>\
(AA, K,) applied to both, (K,) as also ↓ مُشِبٌّ,<br>\
(TA,) or to a bull, (AA,) is syn. with ↓ شابٌّ<br>\
[meaning youthful, or in the prime of life]:<br>\
(AA, K, TA:) and accord. to AO, شَبَبٌ, applied<br>\
to a bull, means that has attained to the end of<br>\
شَبَاب [i. e. youthfulness, or the prime of life]:<br>\
(S, TA:) or, as some say, that has attained to<br>\
the end of his full growth and strength; as also<br>\
↓ شَبُوبٌ, which is likewise applied to the female;<br>\
or, accord. to AHát and ISh, when he is a year<br>\
old, and weaned, he is called دَبَبٌ; and then,<br>\
شَبَبٌ [meaning more than a year old]; and the<br>\
female, شَبَبةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
شَبَابٌ and ↓ شَبِيبَةٌ [both mentioned above as<br>\
inf. ns.] (S, Msb, K) [and ↓ شَبَابِيَّةٌ which is a simple<br>\
subst.] Youth, youthfulness, the prime of man-<br>\
hood, or young manhood; syn. فَتَآءٌ; (K;) or<br>\
حَدَاثَةٌ; contr. of شَيْبٌ: (S:) or the state from<br>\
puberty to the completion of thirty years; or<br>\
from sixteen years to thirty-two; after which a<br>\
man is called كَهْلٌ; (TA;) the age before الكُهُولَة:<br>\
(Msb:) or the state between thirty and forty:<br>\
(Mgh:) or, accord. to Mohammad Ibn-Habeeb,<br>\
the state from the seventeenth year to the completion of fifty-one years is termed ↓ شَبَابِيَّةٌ; the<br>\
period before, from birth, being termed غُلُومِيَّةٌ;<br>\
and in the period after, a man being called شَيْخٌ,<br>\
until he dies. (TA.) One says, سَقَى اللّٰهُ عَصْرَ<br>\
↓ الشَبِيبَةِ [May God freshen as with rain the<br>\
times, or mornings, or afternoons, of youth, &amp;c.],<br>\
and عُصُورَ الشَّبَائِبِ [the times, &amp;c., of the states of<br>\
youth, &amp;c.]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [شَبَابٌ often signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The sap, or vigour, of youth or young manhood.]<br>\
One says, اِسْتَحَارَ شَبَابُهَا, as in a verse of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, (assumed tropical:)  The sap [or vigour] of youth (مَآءٌ<br>\
الشَّبَابِ) flowed in her. (IB, TA in art. حير.) And<br>\
اِمْتَلَأَ شَبَابًا (assumed tropical:)  [He became full of the sap, or vigour,<br>\
of youth or young manhood]. (The lexicons, &amp;c.,<br>\
passim.) [But] مَآءٌ الشَّبَابِ signifies [also] (tropical:)  The<br>\
freshness, or brightness, and beauty, of youth.<br>\
(Har p. 340.) [And ↓ شَبِيبَةٌ app. signifies also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Youthful folly, or the like; (see an ex. voce<br>\
غَمْرَةٌ;) and so, probably, does شَبَابٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,]<br>\
شَبَابٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The first, or beginning, or<br>\
the new, or recent, state, of a thing; (K, TA;)<br>\
and so ↓ شَبِيبَةٌ. (TA.) One says, قَدِمَ فِى شَبَابِ<br>\
الشَّهْرِ (A, TA) (tropical:)  He came, or arrived, in the beginning of the month. (TA.) And لَقِيتُهُ فِى<br>\
شَبَابِ النَّهَارِ (A, TA) (tropical:)  I met him in the beginning<br>\
of the day: (TA:) and جِئْتُكَ فِى شَبَابِ النَّهَارِ and<br>\
بِشَبَابِ النَّهَارِ (assumed tropical:)  I came to thee in the beginning of<br>\
the day: (Lh, TA:) or شَبَابُ النَّهَارِ means the<br>\
period when the sun has risen high, when one<br>\
fifth of the day has passed. (A in art. رأد.) And one<br>\
says also ↓ فَعَلَ ذٰلِكَ فِى شَبِيبَتِهِ He did that at<br>\
the commencement thereof. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also شَابٌّ<br>\
-A3-  And see 2.<br>\
شِبَابٌ an inf. n. of شَبَّ said of a horse. (S,<br>\

places.<br>\
شِبَابٌ: see شَبَّ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
horse whose hind feet pass beyond his fore feet;<br>\
(K;) which is a fault: accord. to Th, such is<br>\
termed ↓ شَبِيبٌ: IM says that the correct word<br>\
is شَئِيتٌ: [but] see this in its proper place. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A thing with which a fire is kindled, or<br>\
made to burn, burn up, burn brightly or fiercely,<br>\
blaze, or flame; (S, K;) and so ↓ شِبَابٌ. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence, as also ↓ شِبَابٌ,] (tropical:)  A thing that<br>\
serves [as a foil] for beautifying, or setting off,<br>\
(K,) [or making to appear bright and beautiful,]<br>\
or for increasing, or enhancing, and strengthening,<br>\
[or heightening, in beauty,] (S, TA,) to another<br>\
thing. (S, K, TA.) So in the saying, هٰذَا شَبُوبٌ<br>\
لِكَذَا (tropical:)  This is a thing that serves for increasing,<br>\
or enhancing, [or heightening, in beauty,] to such<br>\
a thing. (S, TA.) One says of a woman&#39;s headcovering, هُوَ شَبُوبٌ لِوَجْهِهَا (tropical:)  [It is a thing that<br>\
serves for giving an appearance of additional<br>\
brightness and beauty to her face]. (A.)<br>\

IAar mentions ↓ شَبٌّ as an epithet applied to a<br>\
man [in the same sense as شَابٌّ]: (TA:) a female<br>\
is termed شَابَّةٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ شَبَّةٌ; both signifying the same: (S, K:) the pl. of شَابٌّ is<br>\
شُبَّانٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and شَبَبَةٌ (S, A, K)<br>\
and ↓ شَبَابٌ, (S, A, * K,) or the last is an inf. n.<br>\

females, (Msb,) or women, (K,) are termed<br>\
شَوَابٌّ (Msb, K) and شَبَائِبُ, (K,) the latter said<br>\
by AZ to be allowable in the sense of the former,<br>\
(TA,) which is pl. of شَابَّةٌ, (Msb,) شَبَائِبُ, accord.<br>\
to Az, being pl. (not of شَابَّةٌ but) of شَبَّةٌ, like as ضَرَائِرُ<br>\
is of ضَرَّةٌ: (TA:) the dim. of شَابَّةٌ is ↓ شُوَيْبَّةٌ, and<br>\
some of the Arabs say ↓ شُوَابَّةٌ, changing the ى<br>\
into ا before a double letter [as in دُوَابَّةٌ for دُوَيْبَّةٌ].<br>\
(ISd, L in art. هد.) One says, مَرَرْتُ بِرِجَال ٍ شَبَبَة ٍ<br>\
