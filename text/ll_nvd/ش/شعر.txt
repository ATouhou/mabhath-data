شَعَرَ بِهِ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) and شَعُرَ بِهِ, (K,)<br>\

correct, though the former is the [more] chaste,<br>\
(TA,) aor.<br>\
شَعُرَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. شِعْرٌ (S, Msb,<br>\
K, &amp;c.) and شَعْرٌ (K, TA) and شَعَرٌ, (TA, and so<br>\
in the CK in the place of شَعْرٌ,) but the first is the<br>\
most common, (TA,) and شِعْرَةٌ (Msb, K) and<br>\
شَعْرَةٌ and شُعْرَةٌ, (K,) of which last three the first<br>\
is the most common, (TA,) and شِعْرَى and شُعْرَى<br>\
(K) and شَعْرَى (TA) and شُعُورٌ (Msb, K) and<br>\
شُعُورَةٌ, (K,) which is said to be the inf. n. of شَعُرَ,<br>\
(TA,) and مَشْعُورٌ and مَشْعُورَةٌ (Lh, K) and<br>\
مَشْعُورَآءُ, (K,) which is of extr. form, (TA,) He<br>\
knew it; knew, or had knowledge, of it; was<br>\
cognizant of it; or understood it; (S, * A, Msb,<br>\
K, TA;) as also شَعَرَ لَهُ: (Lh, TA:) or he knew<br>\
the minute particulars of it: or he perceived it by<br>\
means of [any of] the senses. (TA.) Lh mentions<br>\
the phrase أَشْعُرُ فُلَانًا مَا عَمِلَهُ and أَشْعُرُ لِفُلَانٍ مَا<br>\
عَمِلَهُ [I know what such a one did or has done],<br>\
and مَا شَعَرْتُ فُلَانًا مَا عَمِلَهُ [I knew not what such<br>\
a one did], as on the authority of Ks, and says<br>\

شَعُرَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. شِعْرٌ and شَعْرٌ, (K,<br>\
TA,) or شَعَرٌ, (so accord. to the CK instead of<br>\
شَعْرٌ,) He said, or spoke, or gave utterance to,<br>\
poetry; spoke in verse; poetized; or versified;<br>\
syn. قَالَ شِعْرًا; [for poetry was always spoken by<br>\
the Arabs in the classical times; and seldom<br>\
written, if written at all, until after the life-time<br>\
of the author;] (A, Msb, K;) as also شَعُرَ: (K:)<br>\
or the latter signifies he made good, or excellent,<br>\
poetry or verses; (K, MF;) and this is the signification more commonly approved, as being more<br>\
agreeable with analogy: (MF:) or the latter signifies he was, or became, a poet; (S;) as also<br>\
شَعِرَ, aor.<br>\
شَعَرَ. (TA.) One says, شَعَرْتُ لِفُلَانٍ I<br>\
said, or spoke, poetry, &amp;c., to such a one. (TS,<br>\
O, TA.) And لَوْ شَعُرَ بِنَقْصِهِ لَمَا شَعَرَ [Had he<br>\
known his deficiency, he had not spoken poetry, or<br>\
versified]. (A.)<br>\

شَاْعَرَ ↓ شَاعَرَهُ فَشَعَرَهُ, (S, K,) aor. of the latter<br>\
شَعَرَ,<br>\
that is with fet-h, (S, MF,) accord. to Ks, who<br>\
holds it to be thus even in this case, where superiority is signified, on account of the faucial<br>\
letter; or, accord. to most,<br>\
شَعُرَ, agreeably with the<br>\
general rule; (MF;) He vied, or contended, with<br>\
him in poetry, and he surpassed him therein. (S,<br>\
K, MF.)<br>\
-A2-  And شاعرهُ, (S,) and شاعرها, (A,<br>\
Msb, K,) and ↓ شَعَرَهَا, (A, K,) He slept with<br>\
him, and with her, (نَاوَمَهُ, S, and نَامَ مَعَهَا, Msb,<br>\
K, or ضَاجَعَهَا, A,) in one شِعَار [or innermost<br>\
garment]. (S, A, Msb, K.)<br>\
-A3-  [Reiske, as mentioned by Freytag, explains شاعر as signifying<br>\
also Tractavit, prensavit, vellicavit: but without<br>\
naming any authority.]<br>\
4<br>\
اشعرهُ He made him to know. (S.) You<br>\
say, اشعرهُ بِالأَمْرِ and الأَمْرَ, (K,) the latter of<br>\
which is less usual than the former, because one<br>\
says شَعَرَ بِهِ but not شَعَرَهُ, (MF,) He aquainted<br>\
him with the affair; made him to know it. (K.)<br>\
And أَشْعَرْتُ أَمْرَ فَلَانٍ I made known the affair of<br>\
such a one. (A.) And أَشْعَرْتُ فُلَانًا I made such<br>\
a one notorious for an evil deed or quality. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (inf. n. إِشْعَارٌ, Msb,) He marked it,<br>\
namely a beast destined for sacrifice at Mekkeh,<br>\
(S, * Mgh, Msb, * K, TA,) by stabbing it in the<br>\
right side of its hump so that blood flowed from<br>\
it, (S,) or by making a slit in its skin, (K,) or by<br>\
stabbing it (K, TA) in one side of its hump with<br>\
a مِبْضَع or the like, (TA,) so that the blood appeared, (K, TA,) or by making an incision in its<br>\
hump so that the blood flowed, (Msb,) in order<br>\
that it might be known to be destined for sacrifice. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, app.,] (assumed tropical:)  He wounded<br>\
him so as to cause blood to come. (TA.) It is<br>\
said in a trad. respecting the assassination of<br>\
&#39;Othmán, أَشْعَرَهُ مِشْقَصًا (assumed tropical:)  He wounded him so as<br>\
to cause blood to come with a مشقص [q. v.]:<br>\
(TA:) and in another trad., أَشْعِرَ أَمِيرُ المُؤْمِنِينَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The Prince of the Faithful was wounded so<br>\
that blood came from him]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  He<br>\
pierced him with a spear so as to make the spearhead enter his inside: and اشعرهُ سِنَانًا (tropical:)  he made<br>\
the spear-head to enter into the midst of him:<br>\
[but this is said to be] from اشعرهُ بِهِ “ he made<br>\
it to cleave to it. ” (TA.) أَشْعِرَ is said specially<br>\
of a king, meaning He was slain. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
Also He made it to be a distinguishing sign: as<br>\
when the performance of a religious service is<br>\
made, or appointed, by God to be a sign [whereby<br>\
his religion is distinguished]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And<br>\
اشعروا They called, uttering their شِعَار [whereby<br>\
they might know one another]: or they appointed<br>\
for themselves a شِعَار in their journey. (Lh, K,<br>\
TA. [See also 10.])<br>\
-A2-  مَا أَشْعَرَهُ [How good, or<br>\
excellent, a poet is he !]. (TA in art. خزى: see<br>\
مُخْزٍ in that art.)<br>\
-A3-  اشعر [from شَعْرٌ or شَعَرٌ signifying “ hair ”] It (a fœtus, S, A, K, in the belly<br>\
of its mother, TA) had hair growing upon it;<br>\
(S, A, K;) as also ↓ تشعّر; (S, K;) and ↓ شعّر,<br>\
inf. n. تَشْعِيرٌ; and ↓ استشعر. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And اشعرت<br>\
She (a camel) cast forth her fœtus with hair upon<br>\
it. (Ktr, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اشعر He lined a boot, (A,<br>\
K,) and a جُبَّة, (A,) and the مِيثَرَة of a horse&#39;s<br>\
saddle, and a قَلَنْسُوَة, and the like, (TA,) with<br>\
hair; (A, K;) as also ↓ شَعَرَ; (Lh, A, K;) and<br>\
↓ شعّر, (K,) inf. n. تَشْعِيرٌ: (TA:) or, said of a<br>\
ميثرة, he covered it with hair. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
اشعرهُ He clad him with a شِعَار [i. e. an innermost<br>\
garment]. (S, A, K.) And He put on him a<br>\
garment as a شِعَار, i. e., next his body. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence,] اشعرهُ فُلَانٌ شَرًّا (tropical:)  Such a one involved<br>\
him in evil. (S, A.) And اشعرهُ الحُبُّ مَرَضًا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Love involved him in disease]. (S.) And<br>\
اشعرهُ بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He made it (i. e. anything) to cleave,<br>\
or stick, to it, [like the شِعَار to the body,] i. e.,<br>\
to another thing. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [And (assumed tropical:)  It clave to<br>\
him, or it, as the شِعَار cleaves to the body.<br>\
Hence,] اشعرهُ الهَمُّ (tropical:)  [Anxiety clave to him as the<br>\
شِعَار cleaves to the body]. (A.) And اشعر الهَمُّ<br>\
قَلْبِى (tropical:)  Anxiety clave to my heart (K, TA) as the<br>\
شِعَار cleaves to the body. (TA.) And أَشْعَرَ الرَّجُلُ<br>\
هَمًّا (tropical:)  The man clave to anxiety as the شِعَار cleaves<br>\
to the body. (S, TA. [In one of my copies of the<br>\
S, أُشْعِرَ, accord. to which reading, the phrase<br>\
should be rendered The man was made to have<br>\
anxiety cleaving to him &amp;c.])<br>\
-A4-  اشعر السِّكِّينَ<br>\
(tropical:)  He put a شَعِيرَة [q. v.] to the knife. (S, A, K. *)<br>\
5<br>\

poet, not being such. (See its part. n., below.)]<br>\
10<br>\
استشعرت البَقَرَةُ The cow uttered a cry to<br>\
her young one, desiring to know its state. (A,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And استشعروا They called, one to another,<br>\
uttering the شِعَار [by which they were mutually<br>\
known], in war, or fight. (TA. [See also 4.])<br>\
-A2-  استشعر as syn. with اشعر and تشعّر: see 4, in<br>\
the latter half of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (A,) or<br>\
استشعر شِعَارًا, (K,) He put on, or clad himself<br>\
with, a شعار [i. e. an innermost garment]. (A,<br>\
K.) [Hence,] اِسْتَشْعِرْ خَشْيَةَ اللّٰهِ (tropical:)  Make thou<br>\
the fear of God to be شِعَارَ قَلْبِكَ [i. e. the thing<br>\

(tropical:)  He conceived in his mind fear. (S, A. *)<br>\
شَعْرٌ and ↓ شَعَرٌ, (A, Msb, K, but only the latter<br>\
in my copies of the S and in the O,) two wellknown dial. vars., the like being common in<br>\
cases of this kind, in which the medial radical<br>\
letter is a faucial, (MF,) [but the latter I have<br>\
found to be the more common,] Hair; i. e. what<br>\
grows upon the body, that is not صُوف nor وَبَر;<br>\
(K;) it is an appertenance of human beings and<br>\
of other animals: (S, A, Msb:) [when spoken of<br>\
as used in the fabrication of cloth for tents &amp;c.,<br>\
the meaning intended is goats&#39; hair: (see 4 in art.<br>\
بنى:)] of the masc. gender: (Msb, TA:) pl. (of<br>\
the former, Msb) شُعُورٌ and (of the latter, Msb)<br>\
أَشْعَارٌ (S, Msb, K) and (of the latter also, TA)<br>\
شِعَارٌ: (K, TA:) and ↓ أُشَيْعَارٌ, properly dim. of<br>\
أَشْعَارٌ, is used, accord. to Aboo-Ziyád, as dim. of<br>\
شُعُورٌ: (TA:) the n. un. is with ة: (S, A, * Msb,<br>\
K:) and this, i. e. شَعْرَةٌ [or شَعَرَهٌ], is also used<br>\
metonymically as a pl. (K, TA.) One says,<br>\
بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكَ المَالُ شَقُّ الشَّعْرَةِ and شَقُّ الأُبْلُمَةِ (assumed tropical:)  [The<br>\
property is, or shall be, equally divided between<br>\
me and thee]. (TA.) And رَأَى فُلَانٌ الشَّعْرَةَ Such<br>\
a one saw, or has seen, hoariness, or white hairs,<br>\
(Yaakoob, S, A, TA,) upon his head. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[The n. un.] شَعْرَةٌ is also used, metonymically, as<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  A daughter. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And ↓ شَعَرٌ (K,<br>\
and so accord. to the TA, but in the CK ↓ شُعْرٌ,)<br>\
signifies also (tropical:)  Plants and trees; (K, TA;) as<br>\
being likened to hair. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And the same,<br>\
(A, K, TA, but in the CK ↓ شُعْرٌ,) (tropical:)  Saffron<br>\
(A, K) before it is pulverized. (A.)<br>\
شُعْرٌ: see the next two preceding sentences.<br>\
شِعْرٌ [an inf. n., (see 1, first sentence,) and used<br>\
as a simple subst. signifying] Knowledge; cognizance: (K, TA:) or knowledge of the minute<br>\
particulars of things: or perception by means of<br>\
[any of] the senses. (TA.) One says, لَيْتَ<br>\
شِعْرِى فُلَانًا مَا صَنَعَ, (Ks, Lh, S, * Msb, * K, *) and<br>\
لَيْتَ شِعْرِى لَهُ مَا صَنَعَ, and لَيْتَ شِعْرِى عَنْهُ مَا صَنَعَ,<br>\
(Ks, Lh, K, *) i. e. Would that I knew what such<br>\
a one did, or has done; (S, * K, * Msb, * TA;)<br>\
for would that my knowledge were present at, or<br>\
comprehending, what such a one did, or has done;<br>\
the phrase being elliptical: (TA:) accord. to Sb,<br>\
لَيْتَ شِعْرِى is for ليت شِعْرَتِى, the ة being elided<br>\
as in هُوَ أَبُو عُذْرِهَا [for هو ابو عُذْرَتِهَا], (S, TA,) the<br>\
elision of the ة in this latter instance, as Sb says,<br>\
being peculiar to the case of the words being preceded by ابو; [but see عُذْرَةٌ;] and as in إِقَامَة<br>\
when used as a prefixed noun; though لَيْتَ شِعْرَتِى<br>\
is not now known to have been heard. (TA.)<br>\
One says also, لَيْتَ شِعْرِى مَا كَانَ Would that I<br>\
knew what happened, or has happened. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
The predominant signification of شِعْرٌ is Poetry,<br>\
or verse; (Msb, K;) because of its preeminence<br>\
by reason of the measure and the rhyme; though<br>\
every kind of knowledge is شِعْرٌ: (K:) or because<br>\
it relates the minute affairs of the Arabs, and the<br>\
occult particulars of their secret affairs, and their<br>\
facetiæ: (Er-Rághib, TA:) it is properly defined<br>\
as language qualified by rhyme and measure intentionally; which last restriction excludes the<br>\
like of the saying in the Kur [xciv. 3 and 4],<br>\
اَلَّذِى أَنْقَضَ ظَهْرَكْ وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكْ, because this<br>\
is not intentionally qualified by rhyme and measure: (KT; and the like is said in the Msb:) and<br>\
sometimes a single verse is thus termed: (Akh,<br>\
TA:) pl. أَشْعَارٌ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Falsehood;<br>\
because of the many lies in poetry. (B, TA.)<br>\
شَعَرٌ: see شَعْرٌ, in two places.<br>\
شَعِرٌ: see أَشْعَرُ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [The fem.] شَعِرَةٌ signifies<br>\
[particularly] A sheep or goat (شَاةٌ) having hair<br>\
growing between the two halves of its hoof, which<br>\
in consequence bleed: or having an itching in its<br>\
knees, (K, TA,) and therefore always scratching<br>\
with them. (TA.)<br>\
شَعْرَةٌ and شَعَرَةٌ ns. un. of شَعْرٌ [q. v.] and شَعَرٌ.<br>\
شِعْرَةٌ The hair of the pubes; (T, Msb, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ شِعْرَآء, [accord. to general analogy with<br>\
tenween,] or ↓ شَعْرَآء, [and if so, without tenween,]<br>\
accord to different copies of the K; (TA;) of a<br>\
man and of a woman; and of the hinder part of<br>\
a woman: (T, Msb:) or the hair of the pubes of<br>\
a woman, specially: (S, O, Msb:) and the pubes<br>\
(عَانَة) [itself]: (K:) and the place of growth of<br>\
the hair beneath the navel. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
A portion of hair. (K, * TA.)<br>\
الشِّعْرَى [The star Sirius;] a certain bright<br>\
star, also called المِرْزَمُ; (TA; [but see this latter<br>\
appellation;]) the star that rises [aurorally]<br>\
after الجَوْزَآء [by which is here meant Gemini],<br>\
in the time of intense heat, (S, TA,) and after<br>\
الهَقْعَة [app. a mistranscription for الهَنْعَة]: (TA:)<br>\
[about the epoch of the Flight, it rose aurorally,<br>\
in Central Arabia, on the 13th of July, O. S.:<br>\
(see النَّثْرَةُ; and see also مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل:)<br>\
on the periods of its rising at sunset, and setting<br>\
aurorally, see دَبَرٌ and دَبُورٌ:] the Arabs say, إِذَا<br>\
طَلَعَتِ الشِّعْرَى جَعَلَ صَاحِبُ النَّخْلِ يَرَى [When<br>\
Sirius rises aurorally, the owner of the palm-trees<br>\
begins to see what their fruit will be]: (TA:)<br>\
there are two stars of this name; الشِّعْرَى العَبُورُ<br>\
and الشِّعْرَى الغُمَيْصَآءُ, (S, K,) together called<br>\
الشِّعْرَيَانِ: the former is that [above mentioned]<br>\
which is in [a mistake for “ after ”] الجَوْزَآء, and the<br>\
latter is [Procyon,] in the ذِرَاع [by which is<br>\
meant الذِّرَاعُ المَقْبُوضَةُ, not الذِّرَاعُ المَبْسُوطَةُ]; (S;)<br>\
and both together are called the two Sisters of<br>\
Suheyl (سُهَيْل [i. e. Canopus]): (S, K:) the<br>\
former was worshipped by a portion of the Arabs;<br>\
and hence God is said in the Kur-án to be Lord of<br>\
الشِّعْرَى: (TA:) it is called العَبُور because of its<br>\
having crossed the Milky Way; and the other is<br>\
called الغُمَيْصَآء because said by the Arabs to have<br>\
wept after the former until it had foul thick<br>\
matter in the corner of the eye: (K in art. غمص:)<br>\
the former is also called الشِّعْرَى اليَمَانِيَّةُ [the<br>\
Yemenian, or Southern, شعرى]; and the latter,<br>\
الشِّعْرَى الشَّامِيَّةُ [the Syrian, or Northern, شعرى].<br>\
(Kzw.)<br>\
شَعْرَآءُ fem. of أَشْعَرُ [q. v.: under which head it<br>\
is also mentioned either as a subst. or as an epithet in which the quality of a subst. is predominant]. ―<br>\
-b2-  See also شِعْرَةٌ.<br>\
شِعْرَآء [app., if correct, with tenween]: see<br>\
شِعْرَةٌ.<br>\
شِعْرِىٌّ [Of, or relating to, poetry; poetical. ―<br>\

And also (assumed tropical:)  False, or lying]. One says أَدِلَّةٌ شِعْرِيَّةٌ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  False, or lying, evidences or arguments: because<br>\
of the many lies in poetry. (B, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [And<br>\

رَعَيْنَا شِعْرِىَّ المَرَاعِى We pastured our cattle upon<br>\

(TA:) or حَمْض upon which hares feed, and in<br>\
which they [make their forms, i. e.] lie, cleaving<br>\
to the ground; it is like the large أُشْنَانَة [here<br>\
app. used as the n. un. of أُشْنَانٌ, i. e. kali, or glasswort], has slender twigs, and appears from afar<br>\
black. (AHn, TA.)<br>\
شُعْرُورٌ [A poetaster]: see شَاعِرٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also, accord.<br>\
to analogy, sing. of شَعَارِيرُ, which is (assumed tropical:)  Syn. with<br>\

the flies that collect upon the sore on the back of<br>\
a camel, and, when roused, disperse themselves from<br>\
it. (TA.) [Hence the saying,] ذَهَبَ القَوْمُ شَعَارِيرَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The people dispersed themselves, or became<br>\
dispersed: (S:) and ذَهَبُوا شَعَارِيرَ بِقُذَّانَ, (K,) or<br>\
بِقَذَّانَ, and بِقِذَّانَ, (TA,) and بِقِنْدَحْرَةَ, (K,) and<br>\
بِقِنْذَحْرَةَ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  They went away in a state of<br>\
dispersion, like flies: (K:) شعارير thus used being<br>\
pl. of شُعْرُورٌ; (TA;) or having no sing. (Fr,<br>\
Akh, S, TA.) And أَصْبَحَتْ شَعَارِيرَ بِقِرْدَحْمَةَ, and<br>\
بِقِرْذَحْمَةَ, and بِقِنْدَحْرَةَ and بِقِدَّحْرَةَ, and بِقِذَّحْرَةَ,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  They became beyond reach, or power. (Lh, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And the same pl. شَعَارِيرُ, having no sing., also<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  A certain game (S, K, TA) of children.<br>\
(TA.) You say, لَعِبْنَا الشَّعَارِيرَ [We played at<br>\

forms of شَاعِرٌ and شَعَّار. (Sb, TA.)<br>\
شَاعِرٌ A poet: (T, S, Msb, K:) so called because<br>\
of his intelligence; (S, Msb;) or because he knows<br>\
what others know not: (T, TA:) accord. to Akh,<br>\
it is a possessive epithet, like لَابِنٌ and تَامِرٌ: (S:)<br>\
pl. شُعَرَآءُ, (S, Msb, K,) deviating from analogy:<br>\
(S, Msb:) Sb says that the measure فَاعِلٌ is<br>\
likened in this case to فَعِيلٌ; and hence this pl.:<br>\
(TA:) or, accord. to IKh, the pl. is of this form<br>\
because the sing. is from شَعُرَ, and therefore<br>\
should by rule be of the measure فَعِيلٌ, like شَرِيفٌ<br>\
[from شَرُفَ]; but were it so, it might be confounded with شَعِير meaning the grain thus called,<br>\
therefore they said شَاعِرٌ, and regarded in the pl.<br>\
the original form of the sing. (Msb.) A wonderful poet is called خِنْذِيذٌ: one next below<br>\
him, شَاعِرٌ: then, ↓ شَوَيْعِرٌ [the dim.]: (Yoo, K:)<br>\

T, K:) or known poetry: but the former explanation is the more correct. (TA.) One also says,<br>\
sometimes, كَلِمَةٌ شَاعِرَةٌ, [by كلمة] meaning<br>\
قَصِيدَةٌ: but generally in a phrase of this kind the<br>\
two words are cognate, as in وَيْلٌ وَائِلٌ and لَيْلٌ لَائِلٌ.<br>\

the neck] is said of a man though he have not hair<br>\
upon his neck, as meaning (tropical:)  such a one is strong,<br>\

signifies A testicle, or scrotum, (خُصْيَةٌ,) having<br>\

See also شِعْرَةٌ. ―<br>\

of the skin surrounding the solid hoof, (K, TA,)<br>\

containing, or having, trees: or abounding in<br>\

a kind of fly that stings the ass, so that he goes<br>\

and touches nothing but the dog: that of the<br>\
camel inclines to yellowness, is larger than that<br>\
of the dog, has wings, and is downy under the<br>\
wings: sometimes it is in such numbers that the<br>\
owners of the camels cannot milk in the day-time<br>\

parts of the udder and around them, and beneath<br>\
the tail and the belly and the armpits; and they<br>\
do not protect the animal from it save by tar:<br>\
it flies over the camels so that one hears it to<br>\
make a humming, or buzzing, sound. (TA. [See<br>\
also شُعْرُورٌ, under which its pl. شُعْرٌ is mentioned.])<br>\
