شَامَ الشَّىْءَ فِى الشَّىْءِ, (K,) [aor. يَشِيمُ,] inf. n.<br>\
شَيْمٌ, (TA,) He hid, or concealed, the thing in<br>\
the thing: (K, TA:) and he inserted the thing in<br>\
the thing. (TA.) [Hence,] شام سَيْفَهُ, (K,) first<br>\
pers. شِمْتُهُ, (S,) aor. as above, (K,) inf. n. شَيْمٌ,<br>\
(TA,) He sheathed his sword; (S, K;) and [in<br>\
like manner] شام نَبْلَهُ [He put his arrows into<br>\
the quiver]: (TA:) and the former signifies also<br>\
He drew his sword: thus having two contr.<br>\
meanings: (S, K:) A &#39;Obeyd doubted of the latter<br>\
meaning; and Sh knew it not; but the verb is<br>\
said to have this meaning in a verse of ElFarezdak. (TA.) It is said in a trad. of Aboo-Bekr that a complaint was made to him against<br>\
Khálid Ibn-El-Weleed, and he said, لَا أَشِيمُ سَيْفًا<br>\
سَلَّهُ اللّٰهُ عَلَى المُشْرِكِينَ i. e. I will not sheath a<br>\
sword [which God has drawn against the believers in a plurality of gods]. (TA.) [Hence<br>\
also,] one says, شام أَبَا عُمَيْرٍ (K, TA) i. e. [He<br>\
sheathed] the ذَكَر; (TA;) meaning (assumed tropical:)  he attained<br>\
his desire of the virgin. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And شام<br>\
فِى الفَرَسِ سَاقَهُ He struck the mare with his<br>\
shank to make her run: (K:) or he impressed<br>\
(lit. inserted) his leg [or shank] in the belly of the<br>\
mare, striking her [with it]. (Aboo-Málik; TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شِمْتُ مَخَايِلَ الشَّىْءِ I directed my look towards the indications, or symptoms, of the thing,<br>\
waiting, or watching, for it. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,<br>\
or the reverse may be the case,] شِمْتُ البَرْقَ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K, *) aor. and inf. n. as above, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
I looked at, (S, K, *) or watched, or observed,<br>\
(Msb,) the lightning, (Msb, K,) or the cloud<br>\
thereof, to see where it would rain, (S,) or to see<br>\
where it would pour, or bring rain, (Msb,) or to<br>\
see whither it tended and where it would rain:<br>\
(K:) this is done only when it flickers and disappears without delay: and [it is said, but, in my<br>\
opinion, fancifully, and with little reason, that]<br>\
the drawing and sheathing of a sword are likened<br>\
to lightning flickering and disappearing. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence the phrase, شِمْتُ بَرْقَ فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  I looked<br>\
hoping for the benefits of such a one: mentioned<br>\
by Freytag on the authority of Meyd: and the<br>\
like is said in Har p. 319.] And شام السَّحَابَ He<br>\
looked at the clouds from afar: and [in like<br>\
manner,] النَّارَ the fire. (TA.) It is said in a<br>\
prov.,<br>\
لَا تَشِمِ الغَيْثَ فَقَدْ أَوْدَى النَّقَدْ<br>\
i. e. [Look not thou hoping for rain, for] the<br>\
lambs have perished: addressed to him who<br>\
mourns for that which has past. (Meyd.) And<br>\
one says, فُلَانٌ مُوسِرٌ وَلَا أَشِيمُهُ مِنْ فَقْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Such<br>\
a one is wealthy, and I do not look at him in<br>\
hope by reason of poverty]; meaning that he is<br>\
independent of him. (Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,]<br>\
شِمْ مَا بَيْنَهُمَا (tropical:)  Compute thou, or estimate, or<br>\
consider, (K, TA,) and look, or see, (TA,) what<br>\
[relation, or difference,] is between them two.<br>\
(K, TA. [In the CK, شَيَّمَ is erroneously put for<br>\
شِمْ; and قَدَّرَهُ, in the explanation, for قَدِّرْهُ.])<br>\
-A3-<br>\
شَامَ also signifies It (a thing, TA) entered,<br>\
فِى شَىْءٍ into a thing; (K, TA;) quasi-pass. of<br>\
the same verb in the latter of the two senses expl.<br>\
in the first sentence of this art.; (TA;) and so<br>\

(K.) And شِيمَ, inf. n. شَيْمٌ, [perhaps a mistranscription for شَيَمٌ,] He was marked with a شَامَة<br>\
[or mole]: or, as some say, [the pass. part. n.]<br>\
مَشْيُومٌ [signifying “ marked with a شامة ”] has<br>\
no verb: and AZ says that ↓ شَيَمٌ, signifying the<br>\
having upon him a شامة, has no known verb:<br>\
(TA:) or شَيَمٌ is an inf. n. signifying the having<br>\
upon him شَام [i. e. moles]. (Ham p. 361.)<br>\
-A5-<br>\
شَامَ فُلَانًا, (K,) aor. as above, (TA,) He soiled the<br>\
legs, or feet, of such a one with dust, or earth:<br>\
(K, TA:) in [some of] the copies of the K,<br>\
غَيَّرَ رِجْلَيْهِ بِالشِّيَامِ; but correctly, [as in the CK<br>\
and in my MS copy of the K,] غَبَّرَ; and accord.<br>\
to the M, from الشِّيَام, [meaning that the verb is<br>\
derived from this word,] i. e. التُّرَاب. (TA.)<br>\

تَسَنَّمَهُ [q. v.]. (S, TA.) And تشيّم الحَرِيقُ القَصَبَ<br>\
The fire entered, and mixed with, the reeds, or<br>\
canes. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And تشيّمهُ الشَّيْبُ (tropical:)  Hoariness<br>\
came upon him, (K, TA,) and became intermixed<br>\
upon him: or, accord. to IAar, became abundant<br>\
upon him, and spread; (TA;) as also تَسَنَّمَهُ.<br>\
(IAar, M and TA in art. سنم.)<br>\

the person; (Msb;) [i. e.] a pimple inclining<br>\
to blackness, upon the person; (Mgh;) or a<br>\
[natural] mark differing from the colour of the<br>\
