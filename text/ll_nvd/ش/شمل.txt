شَمِلَهُمُ الأَمْرُ, aor.<br>\
شَمَلَ; and شَمَلَهُم, aor.<br>\
شَمُلَ; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) but the latter verb was unknown to As,<br>\
(S, TA,) and is said by Lh to be rare; (TA;)<br>\

(Msb,) and شُمُولٌ, (Msb, K,) and شَمْلٌ; (K;)<br>\

شَرًّا ↓ أَشْمَلَهُمْ [means] عَمَّهُمْ بِهِ [i. e. he, or it,<br>\
included them in common, in general, or universally, with, or by, evil]: (K:) but one should not<br>\
say, اشملهم خَيْرًا. (TA.) [Whether what precedes,<br>\
or what next follows, should be regarded as<br>\
giving the primary signification of شَمِلَ, is uncertain.] ―<br>\

شَمَلَ, inf. n. شَمْلٌ and شُمُولٌ,<br>\
He covered [or enveloped] him with the شَمْلَة, (K,<br>\

-b3-  هٰذِهِ شَمْلَةٌ<br>\
تَشْمَلُكَ means تَسَعُكَ [i. e. This is a شملة sufficient<br>\

-b5-  شَمِلَتْ إِبِلُكُمْ بَعِيرًا لَنَا<br>\

(TA,) The wind shifted to a northerly direction<br>\
(شَمَالًا); (S, TA;) so expl. by Lh: (TA:) or the<br>\

↓ أَشْمَلَت. (O. [In the TA, I find أَشْمَلَت الريح<br>\
ذهبت شماليل مثل شَمَّلت: but this, I doubt not,<br>\
is a mistranscription of the passage in the O,<br>\
which I have here followed; i. e. أَشْمَلَتِ الرِيحُ<br>\
هَبَّت شَمالًا مِثل شَمَلَت; or of a similar passage in<br>\
which إِذَا هَبَّتْ is put instead of هَبَّتْ alone.])<br>\
One says of two persons when they are separated,<br>\
شَمَلَتْ رِيحُهُمَا (assumed tropical:)  [Their wind has become north,<br>\

manner in the Ham p. 595,) or شَمِلُوا, [expressly<br>\
said to be] like فَرِحُوا, (K, [but this I think to be<br>\
a mistake, the weight of authority, and the form<br>\
of the part. n., which is مَشْمُولٌ, being against it,])<br>\
They were smitten, or blown upon, by the wind<br>\
called the شَمَال. (S, K.)<br>\
-A4-  شَمَلَ النَّخْلَةَ, (K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
شَمُلَ, inf. n. شَمْلٌ, (TA,) He picked the ripe<br>\
dates that were upon the palm-tree; as also<br>\
↓ اشملها, and ↓ شَمْلَلَهَا: (K:) or this last (which<br>\
is mentioned on the authority of Seer), accord. to<br>\
some, signifies he took of the شَمَالِيل of the palmtree; i. e., of the few dates remaining upon it.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

with young from half to two thirds of the number<br>\
of his شَوْل [or she-camels that had passed seven<br>\
or eight months since the period of their bringing<br>\

with young, one says, أَقَمَّهَا; (AZ, S, O, TA;) and<br>\
of the شول one says, قَمَّتْ, inf. n. قُمُومٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\

art. درس,)] inf. n. تَشَمُّلٌ and ↓ تَشْمِيلٌ; (K;) the<br>\
former reg.; the latter, which is mentioned by<br>\

the Kur lxxiii. 8], وَتَبَتَّلْ إِلَيْهِ تَبْتِيلًا; (TA;) He<br>\
covered himself with the شَمْلَة [q. v.]. (K.) [See<br>\
also 8.]<br>\
7<br>\
انشمل i. q. شَمَّرَ, (K, TA,) or اِنْشَمَرَ, (O,<br>\
TA,) [both of which signify He passed along<br>\
striving, or exerting himself; and the latter signifies also he acted with a penetrative force or<br>\
energy; and he hastened, or went quickly;]<br>\
فِى حَاجَتِهِ [in his needful affair]. (O, TA.)<br>\
And i. q. أَسْرَعَ [He hastened; went quickly; or<br>\

copy of the Msb:) and likewise (O, K) ↓ شَمْلَلَ,<br>\
(S, O, K,) inf. n. شَمْلَلَةٌ: (S:) and so ↓ شمّل,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. تَشْمِيلٌ. (TA.) And i. q. اِنْشَمَرَ (O,<br>\
TA) and اِنْضَمَّ, (TA,) [both meaning It became<br>\
contracted,] as used by a poet in relation to a<br>\
she-camel&#39;s udder. (O, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اشتمل بِثَوْبِهِ He wrapped, or inwrapped,<br>\
himself with his garment; syn. تَلَفَّفَ: (S, O:) or<br>\
اشتمل بِالثَّوْبِ signifies he wrapped the garment<br>\
around the whole of his body so that his arm, or<br>\
hand, did not come forth from it: (K:) or, as<br>\
some say, he wrapped himself with the garment,<br>\
and threw [a part of] it upon his left side. (TA.)<br>\
[See also 5.] اِشْتِمَالُ الصَّمَّآءِ, which is forbidden<br>\
by the Prophet, is, accord. to As, The wrapping<br>\
oneself with the garment so as to cover with it his<br>\
body, not raising a side thereof in such a manner<br>\
that there is in it an opening from which he may<br>\
put forth his hand, or arm: (O:) this is also<br>\
termed التَّلَفُّعُ: and sometimes one reclines in the<br>\
state thus described: (TA:) but A &#39;Obeyd says,<br>\
accord. to the explanation of the lawyers, it is the<br>\
wrapping oneself with one garment, not having<br>\
upon him another, then raising it on one side and<br>\
putting it upon his shoulders: [so says Sgh; and<br>\
he adds,] he who explains it thus has regard to<br>\
the dislike of one&#39;s uncovering himself and exposing to view the pudenda; and he who explains<br>\
it as do the lexicologists dislikes one&#39;s covering<br>\
his whole body for fear of his becoming in a state<br>\
in which his respiration would become obstructed<br>\
so that he would perish: (O:) or it is one&#39;s<br>\
covering his whole body with the كِسَآء or with the<br>\
إِزَار; (S, Msb;) to which some add, not raising<br>\
aught of the sides thereof. (Msb.) [See also art.<br>\
صم.] One says also, يَشْتَمِلُ عَلَى السَّيفِ [He<br>\
wraps his garment over the sword; or] he covers<br>\
the sword with his garment. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,<br>\
اشتمل عَلَى كَذَا It comprehended, or comprised,<br>\
such a thing.] One says, الرَّحِمُ تَشْتَمِلُ عَلَى الوَلَدِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The womb comprises [or encloses] the young.<br>\
(TA.) [And in like manner one says of a woman,<br>\
اشتملت مِنْهُ عَلَى وَلَدٍ (assumed tropical:)  She became with child by<br>\
him. And الكِتَابُ يَشْتَمِلُ عَلَى كَذَا وَكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
book, or writing, comprises such and such things.<br>\
And hence the phrase in grammar, بَدَلُ اشْتِمَالٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A substitute for an antecedent to indicate an<br>\
implication therein.] ―<br>\
-b3-  One says also, اشتمل<br>\
عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرُ, meaning (tropical:)  The event [such as a misfortune or an evil of any kind beset him, or beset<br>\
him on every side, or] encompassed him; (K,<br>\
TA;) like as the كِسَآء encompasses the body.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  One says of wine, تَشْتَمِلُ عَلَى العَقْلِ<br>\
فَتَمْلِكُهُ وَتَذْهَبُ بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [It compasses the intellect,<br>\
and so takes possession of it, and makes away with<br>\
it]: (Ham p. 555:) or تَشْتَمِلُ عَلَى عَقْلِ الإِنْسَانِ<br>\
فَتُغَيِّبُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [It compasses the intellect of the man,<br>\
and conceals it]; and thus one says of the present<br>\
world or its enjoyments (الدُّنْيَا). (TA.) [اشتمل<br>\
عَلَى شَىْءٍ often means (assumed tropical:)  He took, or got, possession of a thing; got it, or held it, within his<br>\
grasp, or in his possession.] ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence,] one<br>\
says, اشتمل عَلَى نَاقَةٍ فَذَهَبَ بِهَا (assumed tropical:)  He mounted a<br>\
she-camel and went away with her. (AZ, O.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
And اشتمل عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He shrouded, covered, or protected, him with himself, or his own person.<br>\

شَمْلٌ A state of union or composedness: and a<br>\
state of disunion or discomposedness: thus having<br>\
two contr. significations: (MF, TA:) or a united,<br>\
or composed, state of the affairs, (S, Msb, TA,)<br>\
and of the number, (TA,) of a people, or company of men: (S, Msb, TA:) and a disunited, or<br>\
discomposed, state of the affairs [&amp;c.] thereof.<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb.) In imprecating evil upon enemies, (O, TA,) [or upon an enemy,] one says,<br>\
شَتَّتَ اللّٰهُ شَمْلَهُمْ, (O, TA,) or فَرَّقَ اللّٰهُ شَمْلَهُمْ,<br>\
(Msb,) or فرّق اللّٰه شَمْلَهُ, (S,) i. e. [May God<br>\
dissolve, break up, discompose, derange, disorganize, disorder, or unsettle,] their, (Msb,) or<br>\
his, (S,) united, or composed, state of affairs;<br>\
(S, Msb;) and شَتَّ شَمْلُهُمْ i. e. [May their united,<br>\
or composed, state of affairs &amp;c.] become dissolved, broken up, discomposed, &amp;c.: (O, TA:)<br>\
and [in the contr. case] one says, جَمَعَ اللّٰهُ شَمْلَهُمْ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, TA,) or شَمْلَهُ, (Mgh,) i. e. [May<br>\
God unite, or compose,] their, (S, Msb,) or his,<br>\
(Mgh,) disunited, or discomposed, state of affairs<br>\
[&amp;c.]. (S, Mgh, Msb.) And ↓ شَمَلٌ signifies the<br>\
same: El-Ba&#39;eeth says,<br>\
قَدْ يَنْعَشُ اللّٰهُ الفَتَى بَعْدَ عَثْرَةٍ<br>\
وَقَدْ يَجْمَعُ اللّٰهُ الشَّتِيتَ مِنَ الشَّمَلْ<br>\
[Sometimes, or often, God raises the young man<br>\
after a stumble: and sometimes, or often, God<br>\
unites, or composes, what is dissolved, or broken<br>\
up, of the state of affairs previously united, or<br>\
composed]: (S, O:) AZ cites this ex. in his<br>\
“ Nawádir: ” (S:) but Aboo-&#39;Omar El-Jarmee<br>\
says that he had not heard the word thus except<br>\
in this verse: (S, O:) Ibn-Buzurj, however,<br>\
cites another verse as presenting an ex. of the<br>\
same. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  دَخَلَ فِى شَمْلِهَا and ↓ شَمَلِهَا, said<br>\
of a he-camel that has become concealed among a<br>\
herd of [she-] camels, means He entered amid<br>\
their dense multitude: (K, TA:) so in the M<br>\

-A2-  Also, (AHn, O, K,)<br>\
and so ↓ شِمْلٌ, and ↓ شِمِلٌّ, (K,) A raceme of a<br>\

thereto a camel&#39;s tail: (TA:) or such as has<br>\
little fruit: (K:) or of which some of the fruit<br>\
has been plucked: but AO used to say that it is<br>\
the produce [or spadix] of the male palm-tree,<br>\
while not abundant and large. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also<br>\
شَمَالٌ.<br>\
-A4-  And شَمْلٌ مِنْ جُنُونٍ signifies Fear, or<br>\

the end.<br>\
شَمَلٌ: see شَمْلٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q.<br>\
كَنَفٌ [as meaning Quarter, or shelter or protection]: الكَتِفُ in the copies of the K being a<br>\
mistake for الكَنَفُ: one says, نَحْنُ فِى شَمَلِكُمْ i. e.<br>\
فِى كَنَفِكُمْ [We are in your quarter, &amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And A small quantity (S, K) of dates<br>\

and in like manner ↓ شُمْلُولٌ [app. in all of these<br>\
applications]; (K;) [or] as meaning a light<br>\
quantity of fruit of the palm-tree; (TA;) and the<br>\
pl. of the latter is شَمَالِيلُ: (K:) one says, مَا<br>\

There is not upon the palm-tree save a small<br>\

↓ مَابَقِىَ فِى النَّخْلَةِ إِلَّا شَمَلَةٌ and ↓ شَمَالِيلُ There<br>\
remained not upon the palm-tree save somewhat<br>\
in a sparse state [of its fruit]: (TA:) and أَصَابَنَا<br>\
شَمَلٌ مِنْ مَطَرٍ A small quantity of rain fell upon<br>\
us: and رَأَيْتُ شَمَلًا مِنَ النَّاسِ وَالإِبِلِ I saw a<br>\
small number of men and of camels. (S.)<br>\

the last two expl. by Lth as a كِسَآء having a<br>\
sparse villous substance, with which one wraps<br>\
himself, smaller than the قَطِيفَة: (TA:) or the<br>\
first signifies a small كِسَآء which one wears in<br>\
the manner of the إِزَار [or waist-wrapper]: (Msb:)<br>\
or with the Arabs it is a مِئْزَر [or waist-wrapper]<br>\
of wool or of [goats&#39;] hair, which one wraps<br>\
round him: and ↓ مِشْمَلَةٌ, such as is made of two<br>\
pieces sewed together, with which a man wraps<br>\
himself when he sleeps by night: (Az, TA:) and<br>\
this last, accord. to Meyd, signifies a كِسَآء comprising the steel with which one strikes fire, with<br>\
the apparatus of this latter: (Har p. 628:) the<br>\
pl. of the first is شِمَالٌ (Msb, TA) and شَمَلَاتٌ.<br>\

شِمْلَةٌ A mode, or manner, of اِشْتِمَال [or wrapping oneself with a garment as expl. above: see<br>\
8]. (K, TA.) الشِمْلَةُ الصَّمَّآءُ is That [mode of<br>\
wrapping oneself] which is without a shirt and<br>\
without drawers beneath; in the case of which,<br>\
prayer is disliked. (TA. [See 8, and see also<br>\

شَمَلَةٌ: see شَمَلٌ, in two places.<br>\
شَمَلٌّ: see شَمَالٌ.<br>\
شِمِلٌّ: see شَمْلٌ, near the end of the paragraph.<br>\

accord. to AA, he means his hand, or arm, called<br>\
the شِمَال; [i. e. I lowered my left hand or arm;]<br>\
شِمْلَالٌ and شِمَالٌ meaning the same. (S, O.)<br>\

heard except in the poetry of El-Ba&#39;eeth, (TA,)<br>\
and ↓ شَمَلٌّ, (MF, TA,) [every one of these] used<br>\
as a subst. and as an epithet, (K,) [so that one<br>\
says رِيحُ الشَّمَالِ &amp;c. as well as رِيحٌ شَمَالٌ &amp;c.<br>\
and شَمَالٌ &amp;c. alone; The north wind: or a<br>\
northerly wind:] the wind that is the opposite to<br>\
the جَنُوب: (Msb:) the wind that blows from the<br>\
direction of the قُطْب [or pole-star]: (S:) or the<br>\
wind that blows from the direction of the حِجْر<br>\
[which is on what is called the north, but what is<br>\
rather to be called the north-west, side of the<br>\
Kaabeh]: (M, K:) or the wind that blows from<br>\
the direction of the right hand of a person facing<br>\
the Kibleh [by which is meant the angle of the<br>\
Black Stone; i. e., correctly speaking, from the<br>\
north]: (Th, M, K:) or, correctly, the wind that<br>\
blows from between the place of sunrise and the<br>\
constellation of the Bear (بَنَات نَعْش): or from<br>\
between the place of sunrise and the place of<br>\
setting of the constellation of the Eagle (النَّسْر<br>\
الطَّائِر): (IAar, K:) [i. e. the wind that blows<br>\
from some point of the north-east quarter, or<br>\
nearly so: but it was probably thus named as<br>\
being the wind that blows from the direction of<br>\
the شِمَال (or left side) of a person facing the<br>\
rising sun; and therefore the north wind or a<br>\
northerly wind:] it seldom, or never, blows in the<br>\
night: (K:) when it blows for seven days upon<br>\
the people of Egypt, they prepare the graveclothes, for its nature is deadly: it is cold and<br>\
dry: (TA:) [see also نَكْبَآءُ:] the pl. of شَمَالٌ is<br>\
شَمَالَاتٌ (S, O, K) and شَمَائِلُ, which is anomalous,<br>\
as though pl. of شَمَالَةٌ: (S, O:) الأَشَامِل also<br>\
occurs, coupled with الأَجَانِب, in a verse of Et-<br>\
Tirimmáh; and [as أَجَانِبُ is a reg. pl. of أَجْنُبٌ,<br>\
which is a pl. of جَنُوبٌ,] ISd thinks that they<br>\
formed from شَمْلٌ the pl. أَشْمَلٌ; and then from<br>\
this last, the pl. أَشَامِلُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one<br>\
says, ↓ أَصَبْتُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ شَمَلًا i. e. رِيحًا [(assumed tropical:)  I perceived from such a one an odour, app. meaning a<br>\
foul odour]. (TA.)<br>\
شِمَالٌ, (S, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) applied to one of<br>\
the hands or arms, (S, Msb,) The left; contr. of<br>\
يَمِينٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ شِيمَالٌ, (K, TA,<br>\
[in the CK, الشَّمال and الشّمال are erroneously<br>\
put for الشِّمَال and الشِّيمَال,]) the latter thought by<br>\
ISd to be used only by poetic license, for شِمَالٌ,<br>\
(TA,) and ↓ شِمْلَالٌ, (AA, S, O, K,) this last not<br>\
known to Ks nor to As: (TA:) of the fem.<br>\
gender: (S, O, Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَشْمُلٌ, (S,<br>\
O, Msb, K,) because it is fem., (S, O,) and [of<br>\
mult.] شَمَائِلُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) which is anomalous, (S, O,) and شُمُلٌ, and شِمَالٌ like the sing.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The direction [or side] of the hand<br>\
so called: you say, اِلْتَفَتَ يَمِينًا وَشِمَالًا i. e. [He<br>\
looked, or turned his face,] in the direction of the<br>\
يمين and in the direction of the شمال: and the<br>\
pl. in this sense also is أُشْمُلٌ and شَمَائِلُ: (Msb:)<br>\
you say, ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَيْمُنِ الإِبِلِ وَأَشْمُلِهَا He went<br>\
to the right sides of the camels and the left sides<br>\
thereof. (TA in art. يمن.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  Ill<br>\
luck, unluckiness, or evil fortune. (K, TA.) طَيْرُ<br>\
الشِّمَالِ means (tropical:)  Birds of ill luck: (A, TA:)<br>\
every bird from which one augurs evil. (O,<br>\
TA.) One says, جَرَى لَهُ غُرَابُ شِمَالٍ, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  What was disliked, or hated, happened to him:<br>\
as though the bird [to which this is likened] came<br>\
to him from the شِمَال [or direction of the left<br>\
hand]. (TA.) And when the place that a person<br>\
occupies is rendered evil, one says, فُلَانٌ عِنْدِى<br>\
بِالشِّمَالِ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one is with me, or in my estimation, in an evil plight]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also<br>\
شَمَالٌ. ―<br>\
-b5-  Also Every handful of corn, or seedproduce, which the reaper grasps [app. because<br>\
grasped with his left hand]. (K.)<br>\

of bag that is put upon the udder of the ewe or<br>\
goat (S, O, K) when it (i. e. the udder, TA) is<br>\
heavy [with milk]: (K, * TA:) or it is peculiar to<br>\
the she-goat: (K:) pl. شُمُلٌ. (K voce عَرَابَةٌ.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And A similar thing that is put to the raceme of<br>\
a palm-tree, made with pieces of [the garments<br>\
called] أَكْسِيَة [pl. of كِسَآءٌ], in order that the<br>\
fruit may not be shaken off. (S, O.) [In this<br>\
sense it may perhaps be from the same word as<br>\
pl. of شَمْلَةٌ.]<br>\
-A3-  And A mark made with a hot<br>\
iron (سِمَةٌ) upon the udder of a ewe or goat. (K.)<br>\
-A4-  Also A nature; or a natural disposition or<br>\
temper or the like: (O, Msb, K:) accord. to Er-Rághib, so called because [it is as though it were a<br>\
thing] inwrapping the man [and restricting his<br>\
freedom of action], like as the [garments called]<br>\
شِمَال [pl. of شَمْلَةٌ] inwrap the body: (TA:) the<br>\
pl. is شَمَائِلُ, (O, K, TA,) and شِمَالٌ, also, [which<br>\
seems to be rarely used as a sing. in this sense,]<br>\
may be a pl., like دِلَاصٌ. (TA; and Ham p. 489,<br>\
q. v.) &#39;Abd-Yaghooth El-Hárithee says,<br>\
أَلَمْ تَعْلَمَا أَنَّ المَلَامَةَ نَفْعُهَا<br>\
قَلِيلٌ وَمَا لَوْمِى أَخِىمِنْ شِمَالِيَا<br>\
[Know not ye two that the utility of censure is<br>\
little, and my censuring my brother is not of my<br>\
nature, or of my natural dispositions?]: (O,<br>\
TA:) here it may be a pl., of the class of هِجَانٌ<br>\
and دِلَاصٌ: or it may be [شَمَالِيَا,] an instance of<br>\
transposition, for شَمَائِلِى. (TA.)<br>\
-A5-  See also شِمِلٌّ.<br>\
شَمْأَلٌ and شَمْأَلٌّ: see شَمَالٌ.<br>\
شَمُولٌ: see شَمَالٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Wine: (S, K:) or<br>\
wine that is cool (K, TA) to the taste; but this is<br>\
not of valid authority; (TA;) as also ↓ مَشْمُولَةٌ:<br>\
[wine is said to be] thus called because it envelops<br>\
(تَشْمَلُ) men with its odour: or because it has a<br>\
strong puff (عَصْفَة), [when opened,] like that<br>\
of the [wind called] شَمَال [in the CK شمال].<br>\

[Hence,] ذَهَبُوا شَمَالِيلَ They went away in distinct<br>\
parties: (K:) or they dispersed themselves. (S,<br>\
O.) ―<br>\

and in like manner, a meadow, and a pool of<br>\
water left by a torrent; (O;) or, applied to this<br>\
last, smitten by the wind thus called so as to become cool: (S:) and hence, with ة, wine (tropical:)  cool to<br>\
the taste; (S, O, TA; *) or wine exposed to the<br>\

as ISd thinks, from شَمُولٌ [q. v.]: (TA:) or<br>\
مَشْمُولُ الخَلَائِقِ a man whose natural dispositions<br>\
are commended; as being likened to wine that is<br>\
commended: and also whose natural dispositions<br>\
are discommended; as though from الشَّمَالُ, because they do not commend it when it disperses<br>\
the clouds: (Har p. 285:) [for] أَخْلَاقٌ مَشْمُولَةٌ<br>\
[sometimes] means discommended, evil, natural<br>\

شَمَال]: or, as some relate it,<br>\

[meaning in like manner, as is said in the TA, on<br>\
the authority of IAar, in art. جنب: or,] accord.<br>\
to ISk, meaning her familiarity is commended,<br>\
because the جنوب, with rain, is desired for<br>\
abundance of herbage; and her promises are<br>\
not commended. (TA.) ―<br>\

used by Zuheyr, is expl. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  [A tract,<br>\

separates friends; because the [wind called]<br>\
شَمَال disperses the clouds: (TA:) or it means<br>\
quickly [or soon] becoming exposed to view;<br>\
(ISk, O, TA;) from the fact that when the wind<br>\
called the شَمَال blows the clouds, they delay not<br>\
to become cleared away, and to depart: (O:) or,<br>\
accord. to IAar, it means مَأْخُوذٌ بِهَا ذَاتُ الشِّمَالِ<br>\
