شَفِ3َ, inf. n. شُفُوفٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
K) and شَفِيفٌ (S, O, K) and شَفَفٌ, (CK, [but<br>\
not in my MS. copy of the K nor in the TA,])<br>\
It (a garment, or piece of cloth,) was thin, fine,<br>\
or delicate, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) so that what<br>\
was behind it was visible, (S, * IB, Mgh, [for<br>\
خَلَقَهُ in some copies of the S, and خَلْفَهُ in others,<br>\
I read مَا خَلْفَهُ, which is the right reading accord.<br>\
to IB and the TA, agreeably with the reading in<br>\
the Mgh, which is مَا وَرَآءَهُ,]) or so as to tell what<br>\
was beneath it: (O, K:) [and it, (a gem, or the<br>\
like,) was translucent: or was transparent. (See<br>\
شَفَّافٌ.)] One says, شَفَّ عَلَيْهِ ثَوْبُهُ His garment<br>\
was thin, &amp;c., upon him. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ―<br>\
-b3-  And شَفَّ<br>\
جِسْمُهُ, aor.<br>\
شَفِ3َ, inf. n. شُفُوفٌ, His body became<br>\
lean, or emaciated. (S, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  شَفَّ, aor.<br>\
شَفِ3َ,<br>\
inf. n. شِفٌّ, It (a thing, O, Msb) exceeded; or<br>\
was, or became, redundant. (S, O, Msb, K.)<br>\
Hence, in a trad., شَفَّ نَحْوًا مِنْ دَانِقٍ It exceeded<br>\
by about a دانق. (Sh, O.) And one says, شَفَّ<br>\
عَلَيْه, aor. يَشُفُّ, [so in the L and TA, contr. to<br>\
rule, probably a mistranscription for يَشِفُّ,] inf. n.<br>\
شُفُوفٌ; and ↓ شفّف, and ↓ استشفّ; [app. meaning,<br>\
as seems to be indicated by the context, It exceeded it:] and شَفِفْتُ فِى السِّلْعَةِ [app. a mistranscription for شَفَفْتُ] I gained in, or upon, the<br>\
the article of merchandise: (TA: [and so, app.,<br>\
↓ شَفَّفْتُ: see شَفَّى:]) and فى تِجَارَتِهِ ↓ استشفّ<br>\
[He obtained what is termed شِفٌّ in his traffic;<br>\
i. e.] he made gain, or profit, in his traffic; syn.<br>\
رَبِحَ. (S and K in art. ربح.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And sometimes<br>\
(Msb) it signifies also the contr.; i. e. It fell<br>\
short; or was, or became, deficient. (Msb, K.)<br>\
One says, (O, Msb,) of a dirhem, (O,) هٰذَا<br>\
يَشِفُّ قَلِيلًا This falls short, or is deficient, a little.<br>\
(O, Msb.) And شَفَّ عَنْهُ الثَّوْبُ, aor.<br>\
شَفِ3َ, The garment was too short for him. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also شَفَّ,<br>\
(O, K,) aor.<br>\
شَفِ3َ, (O,) It (a thing, O) was, or<br>\
became, in a state of motion, commotion, or<br>\
agitation. (O, K.)<br>\
-A4-  And شَفَّ لَكَ الشَّىْءُ i. q.<br>\
دَامَ and ثَبَتَ [app. meaning The thing belonged,<br>\
or pertained, to thee permanently, or constantly;<br>\
or may the thing belong, &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
-A5-  شَفَّهُ,<br>\
(S, M, O, K,) aor.<br>\
شَفُ3َ, inf. n. شَفٌّ (S, M, TA) and<br>\
شُفُوفٌ, (M, TA,) It (anxiety) rendered him lean,<br>\
or emaciated; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ شَفْشَفَهُ; (S;)<br>\
both are also expl. as meaning it rendered him<br>\
lean, or lank in the belly, so that he became<br>\
slender: (TA:) or, accord. to the M, it (grief,<br>\
and love,) pained his heart: or rendered him<br>\
lean, or emaciated: or deprived him of his reason:<br>\
and it is said of grief as meaning it manifested<br>\
what he felt of impatience. (TA.) And شَفَّ<br>\
النُّفُوسَ, as used in a verse of Towbeh Ibn-El-<br>\
Homeiyir, It hurt and melted the souls. (Ham<br>\
p. 594.)<br>\
-A6-  See also 8, in two places.<br>\
2<br>\
شَفَّ3َ see the preceding paragraph, in two places.<br>\
4<br>\
أَشْفَفْتُهُمْ I preferred them, or judged them to<br>\
excel. (K.) You say, أَشْفَفْتُ بَعْضَ وَلَدِى عَلَى<br>\
بَعْضٍ I preferred some of my children above<br>\
some. (S. [And the like is said in the Mgh.])<br>\
And أَشْفَفْتُ هٰذَا عَلَى هٰذَا I preferred this above<br>\
this. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And اشفّ فُلَانٌ الدِّرْهَمَ Such a<br>\
one made the dirhem to exceed: or, made it to<br>\
fall short. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  أَشَفَّ عَلَيْهِ [if not a mistranscription for أُشِفَّ, which I rather think it to<br>\
be,] He excelled him, or surpassed him. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  أَشَفَّ الفَمُ The mouth had in it a fetid odour.<br>\
(Ibn-Buzurj, TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَشَافَفْتُهُ I took away his or its, شِفّ, i. e.<br>\
excess, or redundance. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the<br>\
next paragraph, in three places.<br>\
8<br>\
اشتفّ مَا فِى الإِنَآءِ (S, O, K) كُلَّهُ (K) He<br>\
drank what was in the vessel, all of it, (S, O, K,)<br>\
even the شُفَافَة [or last drop or remains], (O,)<br>\
not leaving any of it remaining; (S;) [and so<br>\
اِجْتَفَّ;] as also ↓ تشافّ: (S, O, K:) and ↓ استشفّ<br>\
المَآءَ He drank the water to the uttermost, not<br>\
leaving any of it remaining; as also ↓ شَفَّهُ, aor.<br>\
شَفُ3َ,<br>\
inf. n. شَفٌّ: and المَآءَ ↓ شَفَفْتُ I drank much of<br>\
the water without having my thirst satisfied.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence,] in the trad. of Umm-Zara,<br>\
وَإِنْ شَرِبَ اشْتَفَّ [And if he drank, he drank up<br>\
all that was in the vessel]. (S, O.) And it is said<br>\
in a prov., ↓ لَيْسَ الرِّىُّ عَنِ التَّشَافِّ (S, O, TA)<br>\
i. e. The satisfying of thirst is not from the<br>\
drinking up all that is in the vessel; for it is<br>\
sometimes effected by less than this: (O, TA:) it<br>\
is applied in forbidding one&#39;s going to the utmost<br>\
in an affair, and persevering therein. (S, * O,<br>\
TA.) Accord. to IAar, one says also تَشَافَيْتُ<br>\
المَآءَ I exhausted the water; which, ISd says, is<br>\
originally ↓ تَشَافَفتُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Sebreh El-Harashee uses the first of these verbs<br>\
metaphorically in relation to death; saying,<br>\
سَاقَيْتُهُ المَوْتَ حَتَّى اشْتَفَّ آخِرَهُ<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  [I vied with him in giving the draught<br>\
of death] until he drank the last of it, i. e., the<br>\
last of death. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اشتفّ البَعِيرُ الحِزَامَ<br>\
كُلَّهُ means The camel filled, and took up wholly,<br>\
the girth, (O, K, TA,) so that nothing remained<br>\
of it redundant, by reason of the largeness of the<br>\
middle of his body. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استشفّهُ, (O, K,) or استشفّ مَا وَرَآءَهُ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) He saw what was behind it. (O, Msb, K.)<br>\
[Thus the former signifies He saw through it:<br>\
and it is used in this sense both properly and<br>\
tropically.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the saying to the seller of<br>\
cloths, اِسْتَشِفَّ هٰذَا الثَّوْبَ, [which may be rendered<br>\
Look thou through this garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth; but is expl. as] meaning make thou this<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth, single, [by unfolding<br>\
it,] and raise it, or hold it up, in shade, in order<br>\
that I may see whether it be close in texture or<br>\
flimsy. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  استشفّ also signifies [agreeably<br>\
with the explanation of استشفّ مَا وَرَآءَهُ mentioned above] (assumed tropical:)  He distinguished a thing plainly,<br>\
like as one distinguishes plainly a thing behind<br>\
glass. (Har p. 244.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And one says, كَتَبْتُ<br>\
كِتَابًا فَاسْتَشَفَّهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [I wrote a letter, or<br>\
writing, &amp;c., and] he examined attentively what<br>\
was in it. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 8.<br>\
-A3-  And see 1, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
-A4-  [Freytag mentions as a signification of استشفّ “ Desiderio alicujus rei implevit; ”<br>\
with الى before the object: but he names no<br>\
authority for this; and I doubt its correctness.]<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
شَفْشَفَهُ: see 1, latter part. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
accord. to IAar, (O, TA,) inf. n. شَفْشَفَةٌ, (K,<br>\
TA,) It (heat, and cold,) dried it up; namely,<br>\
a thing, (O, K, TA,) such as herbage, (O, TA,)<br>\
&amp;c. (TA.) And accord. to AA, الشَّفْشَفَةُ signifies<br>\
The hoar-frost&#39;s burning [meaning blasting] the<br>\
herbage of the earth: or the burning of a medicament that is sprinkled upon a wound: (O:) or it<br>\
has the former of these two meanings, and signifies also the sprinkling of a medicament upon a<br>\
wound. (K. [But I think that, for وَذَرُّ الدَّوَآءِ in<br>\
the K, we should read وَذَرِّ الدَّوَآءِ, and thus reconcile the K in this case with the O: see, however, what next follows; which may be regarded<br>\
either as confirming the reading in the K, or as<br>\
having misled its author, in this instance.])<br>\
-A2-<br>\
الشَّفْشَفَةُ signifies also The sprinkling of urine<br>\
and the like. (K.) You say, شَفْشَفَ بِبَوْلِهِ He<br>\
sprinkled his urine. (O.)<br>\
-A3-  Also The trembling,<br>\
and the being confused (الاِخْتِلَاطُ), (O, K, TA,)<br>\
resulting from intense jealousy. (TA. [See<br>\
مُشَفْشَفٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And شَفْشَفَ عَلَيْهِ He was solicitously affectionate, or pitiful or compassionate,<br>\
towards him, (TA.) [See, again, مُشَفْشَفٌ.])<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَشَفْشَفَ, said of herbage, It began to<br>\
dry up. (TA.)<br>\
شَفٌّ A thin, fine, or delicate, garment or piece<br>\
of cloth; (AZ, S, Mgh, O, * Msb, K; *) as also<br>\
↓ شِفٌّ (AZ, S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ شَفِيفٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
you say ثَوْبٌ شَفٌّ (S, Mgh, Msb) and ↓ شِفٌّ (S,<br>\
Msb) and ↓ شَفِيفٌ. (Msb:) [see also شَفَّافٌ:]<br>\
and the garment, or piece of cloth, itself, is termed<br>\
شَفٌّ and ↓ شِفٌّ: (Har p. 70:) [i. e. each of these<br>\
words is also used as a subst.; and this is perhaps<br>\
meant in the O and K: or] شَفٌّ signifies also<br>\
a certain thin, fine, or delicate, veil or covering:<br>\
or, accord. to Aboo-Nasr, a certain thin, fine, or<br>\
delicate, veil or covering, of wool, through which<br>\
one sees what is behind it: (S:) pl. شُفُوفٌ. (O,<br>\
Msb, K.) Among the verses of “ the Book ” [of<br>\
Sb, cited as exs. therein], is the following:<br>\
لَلْبْسُ عَبَآءَةٍ وَتَقَرُّ عَيْنِى<br>\
أَحَبُّ إِلَىَّ مِنْ لُبْسِ الشُّفُوفِ<br>\
[Verily the wearing of a woollen cloak, my eye<br>\
being therewithal unheated by tears, is more<br>\
pleasing to me than the wearing of thin, fine, or<br>\
delicate, garments]. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  See also شِفٌّ.<br>\
-A3-<br>\
شفّ [app. شَفٌّ] also signifies Pimples, or small<br>\
pustules, that come forth and then go away.<br>\
(Ibn-Buzurj, TA.)<br>\
شِفٌّ: see شَفٌّ, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  Also, (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, K,) and ↓ شَفٌّ, (L, K,) but the former<br>\
is that which is well known, (L, TA,) and<br>\
↓ شَفِيفٌ, (TA,) Gain, or profit; increase obtained in traffic: and excess, surplus, or redundance: syn. رِبْحٌ [q. v.] : and فَضْلٌ; (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
K;) and زِيَادَةٌ. (Mgh, TA.) Hence (Mgh)<br>\
نَهَى عَنْ شِفِّ مَا لَم يُضْمَنْ, meaning [He (the<br>\
Prophet, TA) forbade] the رِبْح [i. e. gain, or<br>\
profit, of that for which one has not made himself responsible to the purchaser]. (O, Mgh.)<br>\
And one says, لِهٰذَا عَلَى هٰذَا شِفّق [There is, or<br>\
pertains, to this, an excess above this]. (Ksh in<br>\
ii. 15.) And قَالَ قَوْلًا شِفًّا He said a saying that<br>\
was a redundance. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A deficiency:<br>\
thus having two contr. meanings. (ISk and S<br>\
and O in explanation of the first word, K in explanation of the first and second words, and TA<br>\
in explanation of all.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, the first word,<br>\
i. q. مَهْنَأٌ: one says to a person when regarding<br>\
him with a wish for the like of a thing that he<br>\
has attained, or that he possesses, without desiring<br>\
that it should pass away from him, شِفٌّ لَكَ يَا<br>\
فُلَانُ [May it be an unalloyed gratification to<br>\
thee, O such a one]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A thing that<br>\
is little, or small, in quantity; mean, or paltry.<br>\
(TA.) [See also شَفِيفٌ, last signification.]<br>\

-A2-  Also<br>\
i. q. خِفَّةٌ [Lightness, &amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And sometimes it signifies Evilness, or narrowness of the<br>\
circumstances, (رِقَّة,) of one&#39;s state, or condition.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
شُفَافٌ: see شُفَافَةٌ.<br>\
شَفِيفٌ: see شَفٌّ, in two places:<br>\
-A2-  and see<br>\
شِفٌّ.<br>\
-A3-  Also Cold, as a subst.; (ISk, S, O, Msb;)<br>\
thus in the saying, وَجَدَ فِى أَسْنَانِهِ شَفِيفًا [He felt,<br>\
or experienced, in his teeth, cold]; (S, O;) and<br>\
so ↓ شَفَّانٌ: (ISk, Msb:) or, as some say, (O,)<br>\
the hurting, or paining, (لَذْع, [in the CK لَدْغ,]<br>\
of cold: (S, O, K:) and intense cold, with rain<br>\
and wind; and شِفَافٌ is its pl.: (TA:) or intense<br>\
cold [alone]: (Msb:) or a cold wind in which is<br>\
moisture: (O:) and ↓ شَفَّانٌ signifies the cold of a<br>\
wind in which is moisture: (S:) or شَفِيفٌ has<br>\
this last signification; and ↓ شَفَّانٌ, the signification next preceding it: one says, لَهَا ↓ أَلْجَأَهُ شَفَّانٌ<br>\
شَفِيفٌ A cold and moist wind, having [much]<br>\
cold and moisture, made him to betake himself to<br>\
a covert: (IDrd, IF, Msb:) or شَفِيفٌ signifies<br>\
rain and hail: (O:) or so ↓ شَفَّانٌ; [or rain and<br>\
cold: for برد is written in my original without<br>\
any syll. sign;] wherefore some of the lawyers<br>\
say that it is rain and more: (Msb:) or شَفِيفٌ<br>\
signifies also rain in which is hail: (K, TA:) or<br>\
rain in which is cold: (CK:) or a cold wind;<br>\
(K;) as also ↓ شَفْشَافٌ: (O, K:) or this last signifies a wind of mild cold: (S, TA:) and ↓ شَفَّانٌ,<br>\
cold and wind: (O, K:) one says, غَدَاةٌ ذَاتُ شَفَّانٍ<br>\
a morning having cold and wind (S, * O, K) with<br>\
moisture. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Intense heat (IDrd, EsSarakustee, O, Msb, K) of the sun: (IDrd, O,<br>\
K:) thus having two contr. significations. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And Pain in the stomach. (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed,<br>\
O.)<br>\
-A4-  [Also Affected with pain: or with hurt,<br>\

vessel; (S, O, K;) and likewise, of milk: (TA:)<br>\
or the last drop remaining in a vessel: (Ham p.<br>\
239:) IAth says that some of the later writers<br>\
mention it as being with س. (TA.) Dhu-rRummeh uses the phrase الشَّفَا ↓ شُفَافَ, in a verse,<br>\
as meaning In the remaining portion of the<br>\
day. (O.)<br>\
شَفَّافٌ Extremely [or very] thin or fine or<br>\
delicate, so that a thing behind it is visible:<br>\
(KL:) [translucent:] transparent: applied to a<br>\
gem, or the like; and to a garment, or piece of<br>\
