ending of his braying, or the final sounds thereof;]<br>\
(S;) [for] شَهِيقٌ signifies the ending, or final part,<br>\
of the crying, or braying, of the ass; (S, O;) and<br>\

the crying, or braying, of the ass: (O, K:) Zj<br>\

afflicted [in Hell] means a very high-sounding<br>\
moaning: and that, accord. to some, زَفِيرٌ [as used<br>\
in the Kur ubi suprà] is similar to the beginning<br>\
of the cry of the ass, termed شَهِيق; and that شَهِيقٌ<br>\
is in the chest. (TA.) [Said of a man,] شَهَقَ,<br>\
