شَرَّ, (L, K,) sec. pers. شَرِرْتَ, (S, Msb, K,<br>\
MF,) aor. يَشَرُّ; (L, Msb, MF;) and sec. pers.<br>\
شَرُرْتَ, (S accord. to some copies, L, Msb, K,<br>\
MF,) aor. يَشُرُّ; (L, Msb, K, * MF;) and sec. pers.<br>\
شَرَرْتَ, (S accord. to some copies, M, K, MF,)<br>\
aor. يَشِرُّ; (M, K, MF;) of which three vars. the<br>\
first is the best known; and the last is strange,<br>\
and disallowed by most authorities; (MF;) inf. n.<br>\
[of the first or third] شَرٌّ (S, K) and [of the first]<br>\
شَرَرٌ (S) and [of the second or third] شَرَارَةٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
and شِرَّةٌ also is an inf. n. [syn. with شَرٌّ]; (S;)<br>\
He (a man) was, or became, evil, a wrongdoer,<br>\
unjust, bad, corrupt, wicked, mischievous, vitious,<br>\
or depraved. (S, * L, Msb, K, * &amp;c.) The manner<br>\
in which the K mentions شَرَّ with the two aors.<br>\
يَشُرُّ and يَشِرُّ [only, omitting the most common<br>\
aor., i. e. يَشَرُّ,] obviously demands consideration.<br>\
(MF.) One says, شَرِرْتَ يَا رَجُلُ [Thou hast been<br>\
evil, or a wrongdoer, &amp;c., O man], (S, K,) and<br>\
so شَرُرْتَ and شَرَرْتَ. (S accord. to different copies,<br>\
and K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شَرَّ, aor. يَشَرُّ, also signifies He increased in evil, wrongdoing, &amp;c. (L.) It is said<br>\
in a prov., كُلَّمَا تَكْبَرُ تَشَرُّ [In proportion as thou<br>\
growest old, thou increasest in evil, &amp;c.]. (AZ,<br>\
L.) ―<br>\

-A2-  شَرَّهُ, (O,<br>\
K,) aor. يَشُرُّ, (O, TA,) inf. n. شُرٌّ, (O, K,) with<br>\
damm, (K, [which is said in the TA to indicate<br>\
that the aor., not the inf. n., is with damm, but<br>\
this is inconsistent with the common practice of<br>\
the author of the K, and is evidently wrong,])<br>\
He blamed him; found fault with him; attributed<br>\
or imputed to him, charged him with, or accused<br>\
him of, a vice, fault, defect, blemish, or something<br>\
amiss. (O, K, * TA. [See also 4.]) One says,<br>\
مَا قُلْتُ ذَاكَ لِشُرِّكَ وَإِنَّمَا قُلْتُةُ لِغَيْرِ شُرِّكَ I said not<br>\
that to find fault with thee, but I only said it for<br>\
a different purpose than that of finding fault with<br>\
thee: (S, TA:) or this has a different meaning,<br>\
which see below, voce شُرٌّ. (TA.) One says also,<br>\
قَدْ قَبِلْتُ عَطِيَّتَكَ ثُمَّ رَدَدْتُهَا عَلَيْكَ مِنْ غَيْرِ شُرِّكَ وَلَا<br>\
ضُرِّكَ, meaning [I have accepted thy gift; then I<br>\
have given it back to thee] without rejecting it to<br>\
thee or blaming thee [and without injuring thee].<br>\
(IAar, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also شَرَّهُ, (S,) or شَرَّهُ فِى الشَّمْسِ,<br>\
(A,) [aor. and inf. n. as in the next sentence;]<br>\
and ↓ شرّرهُ, (A,) inf. n. تَشْرِيرٌ; (S;) and ↓ اشرّهُ;<br>\
and ↓ شَرْشَرَهُ; (A;) He spread it (i. e. a garment,<br>\
or piece of cloth, S, or some other thing, TA) in<br>\
the sun: (S, A, TA:) this is the primary signification. (TA.) And [hence,] شَرَّهُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
يَشُرُّ. (S,) inf. n. شَرٌّ; (S, K;) and ↓ اشرّهُ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. إِشْرَارٌ; (TA;) and ↓ شرّرهُ, (K,) inf. n. as<br>\
above; (TA;) and شَرَّاهُ [or شَرَاهُ without tesh-deed?]; (K;) He put it (i. e. [the preparation of<br>\
curd called] أَقْط, and flesh-meat, S, K, and the<br>\
like, and salt, S, and a garment, or piece of cloth,<br>\
and the like, K) upon a خَصَفَة, (S, K,) i. e. a<br>\
mat, (TA,) or some other thing, (K,) to dry.<br>\

him in an evil manner; (K;) he treated him<br>\
with enmity, or hostility: (L, TA:) he contended,<br>\

voce جَارَّ.]<br>\
4<br>\
اشرّهُ He attributed, or imputed, to him evil,<br>\
wrongdoing, injustice, or the like: (S, K:) but<br>\
some disallow this. (S. [See also 1.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَشَرُّوهُ<br>\
They banished him, or drove him away, and<br>\
caused him to be alone. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, latter<br>\
part, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] اشرّهُ signifies<br>\
also (tropical:)  He manifested it, revealed it, published<br>\
it, or made it known. (S, A, K.) Thus in a verse<br>\
of Imra-el-Keys, where he says, لَوْ يُشِرُّونَ مَقْتَلِى<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [that they might publish, or make known, my<br>\
slaughter]; as related by As; but it is better with<br>\
س. (S.)<br>\
-A3-  مَا أَشَرَّهُ, and ↓ مَا شَرَّهُ, [the latter of<br>\
which is extr. with respect to form, but more<br>\
commonly used than the former, meaning How<br>\
evil, wrongdoing, unjust, bad, corrupt, wicked,<br>\
mischievous, vitious, or depraved, is he!] phrases<br>\
similar to مَا أَخْيَرَهُ and مَا خَيْرَهُ [which have the<br>\
contr. meaning]. (TA in art. خير.)<br>\

(S,) He split it, or clave it: (A &#39;Obeyd, S:) and<br>\
cut it much, or in many pieces. (A &#39;Obeyd, S,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He bit it, and then shook it; namely, a<br>\
thing. (O, K, TA. [In the CK, نَقَضَهُ is erroneously put for نَفَضَهُ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  شَرْشَرَتْهُ الحَيَّةُ The<br>\

(Msb:) [and evil fortune, misfortune, woe, or<br>\
unhappiness:] contr. of خَيْرٌ: (S, A, K:) pl. شُرُورٌ.<br>\
(Msb, K.) It is said in a trad., in a form of<br>\
prayer, (TA,) used by the Prophet, (Msb,)<br>\
وَالخَيْرُ كُلُّهُ بِيَدَيْكَ وَالشَّرُّ لَيْسَ إِلَيْكَ, (Msb, * TA,)<br>\
meaning [And all good is in thy hands, and evil<br>\
i. e.] wrongdoing, or injustice, or corruptness, is<br>\
not imputable to Thee: (Msb, TA:) or evil is not<br>\
a means of advancement in thy favour, or of<br>\

ascend to Thee. (Nh, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شَرٌّ also signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Poverty. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  Fever. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It is<br>\
also an epithet, applied to a man, (Yoo, S,) and so<br>\

wrongdoing, unjust, bad, corrupt, wicked, mischievous, vitious, or depraved: (Yoo, * Akh, * S, *<br>\
A, * Msb, K: *) [fem. of the former شَرَّةٌ, like as<br>\
خَيْرَةٌ is fem. of its contr. خَيْرٌ; and شُرَّى, fem. of<br>\
أَشَرُّ, is used in the same sense, as will be shown<br>\
in what follows:] the pl. of شَرٌّ, (Yoo, S,) or of<br>\
↓ شَرِيرٌ, (Akh, S, Msb, K,) is أَشْرَارٌ, (Yoo, Akh, S,<br>\
Msb, K,) and of the former شِرَارٌ; (Ham p. 514;)<br>\
and you say قَوْمٌ أَشِرَّآءُ [pl. of شَرٌّ or of ↓ شَرِيرٌ].<br>\
(S.) A woman of the Arabs, (S, L,) who, accord.<br>\
to some, was of the Benoo-&#39;Ámir, (L,) is related to<br>\

(S, L:) or an eye that looks at one with vehement<br>\
hatred. (TA.) And الشَّرُّ [The evil one] is an<br>\
appellation of Iblees. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [It is also used to<br>\
denote the comparative and superlative degrees;<br>\
like the contr. خَيْرٌ.] You say, هُوَ شَرٌّ مِنْكَ [He is<br>\
worse, or more evil or wrongdoing &amp;c., than thou].<br>\
(K.) And هٰذَا شَرٌّ مِنْ ذَاكَ [This is worse, &amp;c.,<br>\
than that]. (Msb.) And فُلَانٌ شَرُّ النَّاسِ [Such a<br>\
one is the worst, &amp;c., of mankind]; (S;) and<br>\
↓ أَشَرُّ; (S, Msb, K;) this latter being the original,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) but rare, (K,) or bad, (S, K,)<br>\
peculiar to the dial. of the Benoo-&#39;Ámir, (Msb,)<br>\
or unused. (Mgh.) The fem. [of شَرٌّ] is شَرَّةٌ, [like<br>\
as the fem. of its contr., خَيْرٌ, is خَيْرَةٌ,] (K,) and<br>\

شُرٍّ بِهِ I did not give this back to thee on account<br>\
of any fault &amp;c., in it, but I preferred to give<br>\
it to thee. (TA.) And مَا قُلْتُ ذَاكَ لِشُرِّكَ I said<br>\
not that on account of a thing that thou disapprovest, &amp;c.: (K, TA:) or this has a different<br>\
meaning, expl. above in the first paragraph. (TA.)<br>\

there is an eagerness for this Kur-án: then men<br>\
have a weariness of it]. (L.)<br>\
شَرَرٌ; n. un. with ة: see what next follows.<br>\
شَرَارٌ, (S, A, O, Msb, TA,) accord. to the K<br>\
شِرَارٌ, but this is a mistake, (MF,) and ↓ شَرَرٌ, (S,<br>\
A, O, Msb, K,) which is a contraction of شَرَارٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) Sparks of fire: (S, O, Msb, K:) n. un.<br>\
of each with ة. (S, A, O, Msb, * K.) See an ex.<br>\
voce شَرَّارٌ.<br>\

which signifies also seas or great rivers [themselves]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (as some say, TA) A kind<br>\
of tree that grows in the sea, or in a great river.<br>\

but one.<br>\
شَرِيرَةٌ A [large needle such as is termed] مِسَلَّة<br>\
(K, TA) of iron. (TA.)<br>\
شِرَّارٌ [Emitting many sparks]. One says, أَبُوكَ<br>\
↓ نَارٌ شَرَّارَةٌ وَأَتْتَ مِنْهَا شَرَارَةٌ [Thy father is a fire<br>\
that emits many sparks, and thou art a spark<br>\
from it]. (A.)<br>\
شَرَّانٌ Certain insects (K) resembling بَعُوض [or<br>\
gnats], (S, K,) which cover the face of a man,<br>\
but do not bite; sometimes called الأَذَى: (S:) of<br>\
the dial. of the people of Es-Sawád: (T, TA:) [it is<br>\
with tenween; for] the n. un. is with ة. (K.)<br>\
شِرِّيرٌ (S, A, K) Abounding in شَرّ [or evil or<br>\
wrongdoing &amp;c.; very evil &amp;c.]; applied to a man:<br>\
(S, A:) pl. شِرِّيرُونَ (K) and أَشْرَارٌ, which latter is<br>\
anomalous. (Ham. p. 699.)<br>\
شَرْشَرٌ, (IAar, S, K,) or (so in the S, but in the<br>\
K “ and ”) ↓ شِرْشِرٌ, (Ibn-Ziyád, S, K,) A certain<br>\
plant, (S, K,) which extends along the ground like<br>\
ropes, (Ibn-Ziyád, AHn, K,) in the same manner<br>\
as the قُطْب, but having no thorns that hurt any<br>\
one: (Ibn-Ziyád, AHn:) Az says that it is a<br>\
well-known plant, seen by him in the desert;<br>\
that it fattens the camels, and makes their milk<br>\
plentiful; and that it is mentioned by IAar and<br>\
others among the plants of the desert: ↓ شِرْشِرَةٌ is<br>\
expl. in the K as though it were the name of<br>\
another plant; but it is not so; for شِرْشِرٌ is the<br>\
pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] thereof: it is a herb<br>\
smaller than the عَرْفَج, having a yellow flower, and<br>\
twigs, or shoots, and large dust-coloured leaves:<br>\
it grows in plain, or soft, ground; and spreads<br>\
wide, as though it were ropes, by reason of length,<br>\
of the measure of a man in a standing posture;<br>\
and has berries (حَبّ), like those of the هَرَاس.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شِوَآءٌ شَرْشَرٌ Roasted flesh-meat, of which<br>\
the grease, or gravy, drips; (S, K;) like شَلْشَلٌ<br>\
and رَشْرَاشٌ. (TA.)<br>\
شِرْشِرٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
شَرْشَرَةٌ, (&#39;Ináyeh, and so in some copies of the K,)<br>\
or ↓ شُرْشُرَةٌ, (so in other copies of the K, accord. to<br>\
the TA,) sing. of شَرَاشِرُ, (K,) which signifies The<br>\
fringe-like extremities of a tail; (S, * K, * A, TA;)<br>\
and of wings. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, metaphorically,<br>\
[or synecdochically,] the pl. is used as signifying<br>\
(tropical:)  The whole: and hence the saying, أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ<br>\
شَرَاشِرَهُ (tropical:)  He betook himself altogether to it; as<br>\
though, says As, by reason of his eagerness, he<br>\
threw himself altogether upon it: accord. to EshShiháb, it means he betook himself [to it], openly<br>\
or secretly: or شَرَاشِرُ signifies (assumed tropical:)  the whole body;<br>\
(K;) and القى عليه شراشره and أَجْرَانَهُ and أَجْرَامَهُ,<br>\
provs. mentioned by Meyd, all signify the same<br>\
[app. (assumed tropical:)  he threw upon it the weight of his body:<br>\
see Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov., ii. 409 and 410: and<br>\
see art. جرم]: or the first of these means (assumed tropical:)  he<br>\
loved it so that he courted death, or destruction,<br>\
(اِسْتَهْلَكَ,) in his love of it: (TA:) or he loved it<br>\
with a love that he would not give up, because of<br>\
his necessity: (Lth, TA:) or (tropical:)  he desired it inordinately, or eagerly, and loved it. (A.) [See<br>\
also أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ أَرْوَاقَهُ, voce رَوْقٌ. Accord. to different authorities,] شَرَاشِرُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  Burdens,<br>\
or weights; (S, K;) sing. شَرْشَرَةٌ: (S:) and it is so<br>\
expl. as used in the saying mentioned above: or<br>\
it there signifies (assumed tropical:)  weight, and whole person: or<br>\
the reduplication implies intensiveness; as though<br>\
this word originally signified weight of evil: but<br>\
F, in his comments on the Preface of the Ksh,<br>\
objects to this, as the word does not imply the<br>\
contr. of خَيْرٌ, but dispersion. (TA.) Also (tropical:)  Self:<br>\
(K, TA:) and the saying mentioned above is expl.<br>\
as meaning (tropical:)  He threw himself upon it, through<br>\
inordinate, or eager, desire, and love. (S, TA.)<br>\
And (assumed tropical:)  Love: (K:) or (assumed tropical:)  love of self. (Kr, TA.)<br>\
شُرْشُرَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
شِرْشِرَةٌ A piece of anything. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\

شُرْشُورٌ A certain bird, (K, TA,) of small size;<br>\
said by As to be thus called by the people of El-<br>\
Hijáz; and by the Arabs of the desert, بَرْقَش [a<br>\
mistranscription for بِرْقِش]: it is said to be dustcoloured; in elegance, like the حُمَّرَة; and to be a<br>\
little larger than the عُصْفُور [or sparrow]. (L,<br>\
TA.) [Freytag, on the authority of Dmr, says<br>\
that it is the same as is called ابو براقش: (but see<br>\
بِرْقِشٌ:) and describes it as being of an ashy<br>\
colour, with some mixture of redness; and of the<br>\
passerine kind.]<br>\
أَشَرُّ; and its fem., شُرَّى: see شَرٌّ, latter half, in<br>\
three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  شُرَّى is also applied to a woman<br>\
as meaning A great imputer of vices, faults, or<br>\
the like, to others. (AA, L.)<br>\
إِشْرَارَةٌ A خَصَفَة, (S, K,) i. e. mat, (TA,) upon<br>\
which [the preparation of curd called] أَقِط (S,<br>\
K) and other things (S) are spread (S, K *) to<br>\
dry; (TA;) [as also ↓ مَشَرُّ or ↓ مِشَرٌّ, as written in<br>\
different copies of the S voce عَبَثَت:] or a piece<br>\
of cloth, of those whereof a tent is composed, used<br>\
for that purpose: (TA:) or a tablet of stone or<br>\
wood, upon which flesh-meat is dried: (Lth,<br>\
IAar:) pl. أَشَارِيرُ: or this pl. signifies pieces of<br>\
flesh-meat cut into strips and dried: (S:) or the<br>\
sing. signifies also flesh-meat cut into strips and<br>\
dried. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A great herd of camels:<br>\
(K:) because scattered. (TA.)<br>\
مَشَرٌّ or مِشَرٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\

biting ” a thing “ and then shaking ” it. (Sgh,<br>\
