شَطْرٌ The half of a thing; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ شَطِيرٌ: (TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَشْطُرٌ (S, K)<br>\
and [of mult.] شُطُورٌ. (K.) It is said in a prov.,<br>\
اُحْلُبْ حَلَبًا لَكَ شَطْرُهُ [Milk thou a milking of<br>\
which half shall be for thee]. (S.) And one says<br>\
شَعَرٌ شَطْرَانِ Hair [half] black and [half] white.<br>\
(A.) Accord. to Ibráheem El-Harbee, (O,) the<br>\
saying of the Prophet, مَنْ مَنَعَ صَدَقَةً فَإِنَّا آخِذُوهَا<br>\
وَشَطْرَ مَالِهِ [Whoso refuses to render a poor-rate,<br>\
verily we take it from him, and half of his property], thus related by Bahz, is a mistake, and<br>\
the right wording is, وَشُطِرَ مَالُهُ, meaning and his<br>\
property shall be divided into two halves, and the<br>\
collector of the poor-rate shall have the option<br>\
given him and shall take that rate from out of the<br>\
better of the two halves, as a punishment for the<br>\
man&#39;s refusal of the rate; (O, K;) but it is said<br>\
that this law was afterwards abrogated: (O:)<br>\
Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, however, says that, in the old time,<br>\
when one refused the poor-rate of his property, it<br>\
was taken from him, and half of his property was<br>\
taken as a punishment for his refusal; and he<br>\
adduces this trad. as evidence thereof; but says<br>\
that in recent times, only the poor-rate was taken<br>\
from him, and this trad. was asserted to be abrogated. (TA. [More is there said on this subject,<br>\
but I omit it as unprofitable.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  It occurs in<br>\
two trads. as meaning Half a مَكُّوك [q. v.], or<br>\
half a وَسْق [q. v.], of barley. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [In prosody, Half a verse.] ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (tropical:)  A part, or portion, or somewhat, of a thing; (Mgh, K;) and so<br>\
↓ شَطِيرٌ. (TA.) In the trad. of the night-journey,<br>\
فَوَضَعَ شَطْرَهَا means (assumed tropical:)  [And He remitted] part, or<br>\
somewhat, thereof; (K;) i. e., of the prayer.<br>\
(TA.) And similar is the saying in another trad.,<br>\
الطَّهُورُ شَطْرُ الإِيمَانِ (assumed tropical:)  [Purification is part of<br>\
faith]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Either the fore pair or the<br>\
hind pair of the teats of a she-camel: she has two<br>\
pairs of teats, a fore pair and a hind pair, and<br>\
each pair is thus called: (S, K:) and either of the<br>\
two teats of a ewe or she-goat: (IAar, TA:) pl.<br>\
أَشْطُرٌ. (S, TA.) Hence the saying, (S,) فُلَانٌ<br>\
حَلَبَ الدَّهْرَ أَشْطُرَهُ (tropical:)  Such a one has known, or<br>\
tried, varieties of fortune: (S, * TA:) has experienced the good and evil of fortune; (S, K,<br>\
TA;) its straitness and its ampleness: being<br>\
likened to one who has milked all the teats of a<br>\
camel, that which yields plenty of milk and that<br>\
which does not; the fore pair being the good;<br>\
and the hind pair, the evil: or, as some say,<br>\
أَشْطُر means streams, or flows, of milk: and [in<br>\
like manner] one says, حَلَبَ الدَّهْرَ شَطْرَيْهِ. (TA.)<br>\
And, as is said in the “ Kámil ” of Mbr, one says<br>\
of a man experienced in affairs, فُلَانٌ قَدْ حَلَبَ<br>\
أَشْطُرَهُ (tropical:)  Such a one has endured the difficulties<br>\
and [enjoyed] the ampleness of fortune, and<br>\
managed his affairs in poverty and in wealth:<br>\
lit., has milked his pairs of teats, one pair after<br>\
another. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also A direction in which<br>\
one looks or goes or the like. (S, A, Msb, K.)<br>\
One says, قَصَدَ شَطْرَهُ He went in his, or its,<br>\
direction; towards him, or it. (S, A.) And it is<br>\
said in the Kur [ii. 139 and 144 and 145],<br>\
فَوَلِّ وَجْهَكَ شَطْرَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ Then turn thou<br>\
thy face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque.<br>\
(Fr, S.) The noun in this sense has no verb<br>\
belonging to it: or one says, شَطَرَ شَطْرَهُ [expl.<br>\
above: see 1]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Also Distance, or remoteness. (TA.)<br>\
شُطُرٌ: see شَطِيرٌ [of which it is both a syn. and<br>\
a pl.].<br>\
وَلَدُ فُلَانٍ شِطْرَةٌ The offspring of such a one are<br>\
half males and half females. (S, A, K. [In the<br>\
Ham p. 478, it is written شَطْرة.])<br>\
شَطْرَانُ, (S, A, K,) fem. شَطْرَى, (K,) A bowl,<br>\
(S, K,) or vessel, (A, K,) half full. (S, A, K.)<br>\
شَطُورٌ A ewe, or she-goat, having one teat<br>\
longer than the other; (S, O, K;) like حَضُونٌ in<br>\
this sense [and perhaps in others also, agreeably<br>\
with what is said of شِطَارٌ in the first paragraph of<br>\
this art.]: (S in art. حَضن:) and (so in the S and<br>\
O, but in the K “ or ”) one having one of her<br>\
teats dried up: (S, O, K:) and a she-camel<br>\
having two of her teats dried up; for she has four<br>\
teats. (S, O.) And A garment, or piece of cloth,<br>\
having one of the two extremities of its breadth<br>\
longer than the other. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the<br>\
next paragraph.<br>\
شَطِيرٌ: see شَطْرٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also Distant,<br>\
or remote; (As, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) applied to<br>\
a town, or country, (As, S,) an abode, (A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) and a tribe. (A.) And so ↓ شُطُرٌ in the<br>\
phrase نَوًى شُطُرٌ [A distant tract, or region,<br>\
towards which one journeys]: (S, K:) so too<br>\
↓ شَطُورٌ in the phrase نِيَّةٌ شَطُورٌ [which may mean<br>\
as above, (like نِيَّةٌ شَطُونٌ,) or a remote, or farreaching, intention, or aim, or purpose]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also A stranger; (S, O, Msb, K;) because<br>\
of his remoteness from his people; (TA;) as in a<br>\
verse cited voce إِذًا: (S, O:) or one who is alone,<br>\
or solitary: (A:) pl. شُطُرٌ. (TA.)<br>\
شَاطِرٌ [One who withdraws far away from his<br>\
family; or breaks off from them, or quits them,<br>\
in anger: (see 1, last sentence:) or] one who<br>\
disagrees with his family, (Msb,) and who<br>\
wearies them by his wickedness (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
baseness (Msb) and guile: (TA:) i. q. خَلِيعٌ<br>\
[meaning as above, and having other similar<br>\
meanings; generally vitious, or immoral; bad,<br>\
evil, wicked, or mischievous]: (A:) accord. to<br>\
some, it is post-classical: Aboo-Is-hák says that<br>\
it signifies one who takes a wrong course: it is<br>\
also expl. as signifying one who outstrips; like<br>\
the [messenger called] بَرِيد, who takes a long<br>\
journey in a short space of time: and hence, [as a<br>\
conventional term of the mystics,] it is applied to<br>\
one who outstrips, and is quick, in attaining<br>\
nearness to God: or as meaning one who has<br>\
wearied his family, and withdrawn far from<br>\
them [n spirit], though with them [bodily], because of their inviting him to carnal lusts, and<br>\
accustomed ways [of the world]: (TA:) [in the<br>\
present day, it is applied to a sharper, or clever<br>\
thief: and to any clever, or cunning, person:] pl.<br>\
شُطَّارٌ. (TA.)<br>\
مَشْطُورٌ [Halved. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] A verse of the<br>\
metre termed الرَّجَز, (O, K,) and of that termed<br>\
السَّرِيع, (TA,) having three of its six feet wanting;<br>\
(O, K;) properly, having half thereof taken<br>\
away. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Bread done over with [the<br>\
seasoning, or condiment, called] كَامَخ. (O, K.)<br>\
هُمْ مُشَاطِرُونَا They are persons whose houses<br>\
adjoin ours. (O, K.).<br>\
