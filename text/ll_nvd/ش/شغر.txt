شَغڤرَ The inf. n. شَغْرٌ, accord. to Ibn-Nubáteh,<br>\
primarily signifies The raising the leg or hind leg,<br>\
without restriction; and then by a metaphorical<br>\
usage, the doing so for the purpose of copulation,<br>\
and for making water: but the explanations of J<br>\
[and of Z in the A] and of Fei and of F are at<br>\
variance with his assertion. (MF.) [Accord. to<br>\
these authorities,] شَغَرَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\

(Msb, K.) And the verb is also trans.: you say,<br>\

is a strange form in the case of a trans. verb,])<br>\
He raised the woman&#39;s leg, (Msb, and so in some<br>\
copies of the K) or legs, (IDrd, O, and so in<br>\

of a guardian, or protector, to defend it: (Msb:)<br>\
or destitute of people: [and so, app., شَغَرَ البَلَدُ<br>\
