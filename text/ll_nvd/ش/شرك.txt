شَرِكَهُ فِيهِ, aor.<br>\
شَرَكَ, inf. n. شِرْكَةٌ (S, Mgh, *<br>\
Msb, K) and شَرِكَةٌ, the former a contraction of<br>\
the latter, but the more usual, (Msb,) and شِرْكٌ<br>\
(Mgh, Msb) and شَرِكٌ, the former of these two a<br>\
contraction of the latter, but the more usual,<br>\
(Msb,) or شِرْكٌ [q. v. infrà] is a simple subst.,<br>\
(S, K,) [He shared, participated, or partook,<br>\
with him in it;] he was, or became, a شَرِيك [or<br>\
copartner &amp;c.] to him in it; (Msb;) namely, a<br>\
sale or purchase, and an inheritance, (S, K,) or<br>\
an affair; (Msb;) and فيه ↓ شاركهُ [signifies the<br>\
same]. (Mgh, Msb, * K. * [It is said in the TA,<br>\
after the mention of شَرِكَهُ with its inf. n. شِرْكَةٌ,<br>\
that it is more chaste than ↓ اشركهُ; by which it<br>\
is implied that this latter is sometimes used as<br>\
syn. with the former; for which I do not find any<br>\
express authority.] And He entered with him<br>\
into it; [or engaged with him in it;] namely, an<br>\
affair. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شَرِكَتِ النَّعْلُ, aor.<br>\
شَرَكَ, The sandal<br>\
had its شِرَاك broken; (Ibn-Buzurj, K;) inf. n.<br>\
شَرَكٌ. (TK.)<br>\
2<br>\
شَرَّكَ see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  [The inf. n.] تَشْرِيكٌ also signifies<br>\
The selling a part [or share] of what one has<br>\
purchased for that for which it was purchased.<br>\
(Mgh, K.)<br>\
-A2-  شرّك النَّعْلَ, (S, * Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. تَشْرِيكٌ, (S, K,) He put a شِرَاك to the<br>\
sandal; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ أَشْرَكَهَا, (S,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. إِشْرَاكٌ. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
شَارَكْتُ فُلَانًا, (S, TA,) inf. n. مُشَارَكَةٌ, (TK,)<br>\
[I shared, participated, or partook, with such a<br>\
one;] I was, or became, the شَرِيك [or copartner<br>\
&amp;c.] of such a one. (S, TA.) El-Jaadee says,<br>\
وَشَارَكْنَا قُرَيْشًا فِى تُقَاهَا<br>\
العِنَانِ ↓ وَفِى أَحْسَابِهَا شِرْكَ<br>\
[And we shared with Kureysh in their piety and<br>\
in their several grounds of pretension to respect,<br>\
with a sharing exclusive of other properties].<br>\
(S.) See also 1. [And see 8.]<br>\
4<br>\
أَشْرَكْتُهُ فِى الأَمْرِ I made him a شَرِيك [or<br>\
copartner &amp;c.] to me in the affair: and ↓ شَرَّكْتُ<br>\
بَيْنَهُمْ فِى المَالِ [I made them copartners in the<br>\
property; and شَرَّكَهُمْ, occurring in this art. in the<br>\
TA, on the authority of Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, means, in<br>\
like manner, he made them copartners; and<br>\
أَشْرَكَ بَيْنَهُمْ is used in this sense in the present art.<br>\
in the K]. (Msb.) وَأَشْرِكْهُ فِى أَمْرِى, in the Kur<br>\
[xx. 33], means And make Thou him my شَرِيك<br>\
[or copartner, or associate, or colleague,] in my<br>\
affair. (S.) And one says also, اشركهُ مَعَهُ فِى<br>\
الأَمْرِ He made him to enter [or engage] with him<br>\
in the affair: and اشرك فُلَانًا فِى البَيْعِ He made<br>\
such a one to enter [or share] with him in the<br>\
sale or purchase. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اشرك بِاللّٰهِ<br>\
He attributed to God a شَرِيك [or copartner<br>\
&amp;c.] (Mgh, TA) in his dominion: (TA:) [or he<br>\
attributed to God شُرَكَآء i. e. copartners &amp;c.,<br>\
such as the angels and the devils: (see Kur vi.<br>\
100, &amp;c., and any of the expositions thereof:)<br>\
i. e. he believed in a duality, or a plurality, of<br>\
gods:] and [in a wider sense,] he disbelieved [or<br>\
misbelieved] in God: syn. كَفَرَ: (S, * Msb, K, TA:)<br>\
used in this latter sense because الكُفْرُ is not free<br>\
from some kind of شِرْك. (Kull p. 49.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also 1:<br>\
-A3-  and 2.<br>\

تَشَاْرَكَ see the next paragraph, in three places.<br>\
8<br>\
اشتركوا and ↓ تشاركوا, (Mgh, Msb,) and<br>\
اشتركا and ↓ تشاركا, (K,) and اشتركنا and<br>\
↓ تشاركنا, (S,) [They, and they two, and we,<br>\
shared, participated, or partook, one with another,<br>\
and each with the other; or were, or became,<br>\
copartners, &amp;c.;] فِى كَذَا [in such a thing]. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] الاِشْتِرَاكُ in lexicology signifies The<br>\
being homonymous; lit. the being shared, or participated, in by several meanings: [used as a<br>\
subst., homonymy:] (Mz, 25th نوع; and Intr. to<br>\
the TA:) one says of a noun [or word] that is<br>\
termed مُشْتَرَكٌ [q. v.], تَشْتَرِكُ فِيهِ مَعَانٍ كَثِيرَةٌ<br>\
[Many meanings share, or participate, in it].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اشترك الأَمْرُ (assumed tropical:)  The affair, or case,<br>\
was, or became, confused, and dubious. (TA.)<br>\
شَرْكٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
شِرْكٌ is an inf. n. of شَرِكَهُ, as mentioned in the<br>\
first sentence of this art.: (Mgh, Msb:) or a<br>\
subst. therefrom: (S:) and is syn. with ↓ شِرْكَةٌ,<br>\
[signifying A sharing, participating or participation, partaking, or copartnership, and mentioned before as an inf. n.,] (K,) as also are<br>\
↓ شَرِكٌ and ↓ شَرِكَةٌ, [likewise mentioned before as<br>\
inf. ns.,] and ↓ شَرْكٌ and ↓ شَرْكَةٌ, (MF, TA,) and<br>\
so is ↓ شُرْكَةٌ, with damm, (K,) this last said by<br>\
MF to be unknown, but it is common in Syria,<br>\
almost to the exclusion of the other dial. vars.<br>\
mentioned above. (TA.) An ex. of the first<br>\
occurs in a trad, of Mo&#39;ádh, أَجَازَ بَيْنَ أَهْلِ اليَمَنِ<br>\
الشِّرْكَ, meaning [He allowed, among the people<br>\
of El-Yemen,] the sharing, one with another,<br>\
(الاِشْتِرَاك,) in land [and app. its produce], by its<br>\
owner giving it to another for the half [app. of<br>\
its produce], or the third, or the like thereof: and<br>\
a similar ex. of the same word occurs in another<br>\
trad. (TA.) See also an ex. in a verse cited<br>\
above, conj. 3. And one says, رَغِبْنَا فِى شِرْكِكُمْ,<br>\
meaning We are desirous of sharing with you in<br>\
affinity, or relationship by marriage. (K, * TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And A share: (Mgh, O, Msb, TA:) as in the<br>\
saying, بِيعَ شِرْكٌ مِنْ دَارِهِ [A share of his house<br>\
was sold]: (Mgh:) and as in the saying, أَعْتَقَ<br>\
شِرْكًا لَهُ فِى عَبْدٍ [He emancipated a share belonging to him in a slave]: (Msb:) pl. أَشْرَاكٌ.<br>\
(O, Msb, TA.) [See a verse of Lebeed cited<br>\
voce زَعَامَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  It is also a subst. from أَشْرَكَ بِاللّٰهِ;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) thus in the Kur xxxi. 12;<br>\
(Mgh, TA;) meaning The attribution of a شَرِيك<br>\
[or copartner &amp;c., or of شُرَكَآء i. e. copartners<br>\
&amp;c., (see 4,)] to God: (Mgh:) [so that it may be<br>\
rendered belief in a plurality of gods:] and [in a<br>\
wider sense,] unbelief [or misbelief]; syn. كُفْرٌ.<br>\
(S, Msb, K, TA.) And it is also expl. as meaning<br>\
Hypocrisy: (Mgh, TA:) so in the saying of the<br>\
Prophet, إِنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافُ عَلَى أُمَّتِى الشِّرْكُ<br>\
[Verily the most fearful of what I fear for my<br>\
people is hypocrisy]: (Mgh:) and so in the trad.,<br>\
الشِّرْكُ أَخْفَى فِى أُمَّتِى مِنْ دَبِيبِ النَّمْلِ [Hypocrisy is more latent in my people than the creeping<br>\
of ants]. (IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also شَرِيكٌ, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
شَرَكٌ The حِبَالَة [properly a sing., meaning<br>\
snare, but here app. used as a gen. n., meaning<br>\
snares, as will be seen from what follows,] of the<br>\
صَائِد [i. e. sportsman, or catcher of game, or wild<br>\
animals, or birds]; one of which is called<br>\
↓ شَرَكَةٌ: (S, O:) the meaning of the شَرَك of the<br>\
صَائِد is well known; and the pl. is أَشْرَاكٌ; like<br>\
سَبَبٌ and أَسْبَابٌ: or, as some say, شَرَكٌ is the pl.<br>\
of ↓ شَرَكَةٌ, [or rather is a coll. gen. n. of which<br>\
↓ شَرَكَةٌ is the n. un.,] like قَصَبٌ and قَصَبَةٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) [i. e.,] شَرَكٌ signifies the حَبَائِل [or snares,<br>\
or by this may perhaps be meant the cords composing a snare, for حَبَائِلُ is an anomalous pl. of<br>\
حَبْلٌ,] for catching wild animals or the like; and<br>\
what is, or are, set up for [catching] birds:<br>\
(K, TA:) one whereof is said to be called ↓ شَرَكَةٌ<br>\
[a term used in the K, in art. شبك, as the explanation of شَبَكَةٌ, which means a net]: (TA:) and<br>\
the pl. of شَرَكٌ is شُرُكٌ, with two dammehs, which<br>\
is extr. [with respect to analogy, like فُلُكٌ pl. of<br>\
فَلَكٌ]. (K.) Hence the trad., أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ<br>\
الشَّيْطَانِ وَشَرَكِهِ, meaning حَبَائِلِهِ وَمَصَايِدِهِ [i. e.<br>\
I seek protection by Thee from the mischief of<br>\
the Devil, and his snares]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شَرَكُ الطَّرِيقِ<br>\
means The main and middle parts of the road;<br>\
(S, K;) syn. جَوَادُّهُ: or the tracks that are [conspicuous and distinct,] not obscure to one nor<br>\
blended together: (K:) pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]<br>\
of ↓ شَرَكَةٌ: (S:) or the أَنْسَاع of the road; (As,<br>\
TA;) i. e. the furrows of the road, made by the<br>\
beasts with their legs [or feet] in its surface, a<br>\
↓ شَرَكَة here and another by the side of it: (TA:)<br>\
or أَشْرَاكٌ [is its pl., and] signifies the small tracks<br>\
that branch off from the main road and then stop,<br>\
or terminate. (Sh, TA.) [See أُسٌّ.]<br>\
شَرِكٌ: see شِرْكٌ, first sentence.<br>\
شَرْكَةٌ: see شِرْكٌ, first sentence.<br>\
شُرْكَةٌ: see شِرْكٌ, first sentence.<br>\
شِرْكَةٌ: see شِرْكٌ, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
piece of flesh-meat; of the dial. of El-Yemen;<br>\
originally, of a slaughtered camel, in which people<br>\
share, one with another. (TA.)<br>\
شَرَكَةٌ: see شَرَكٌ, in six places.<br>\
شَرِكَةٌ: see شِرْكٌ, first sentence.<br>\
شُرَكِىٌّ and شُرَّكِىٌّ A quick, or swift, pace:<br>\
(K:) so says ISd. (TA.) And لَطْمٌ شُرَكِىٌّ A<br>\
quick and consecutive slapping, (S, O, K,) like<br>\
the camel&#39;s slapping when a thorn has entered<br>\
his foot and he beats the ground with it with a<br>\
consecutive beating. (S, * O.) Ows Ibn-Hajar<br>\
says,<br>\
وَمَا أَنَ إِلَّا مُسْتَعِدٌّ كَمَا تَرَى<br>\
أَخُو شُرَكِىِّ الوِرْدِ غَيْرُ مُعَتِّمِ<br>\
[And I am none other than one who is ready, as<br>\
thou seest; one in the habit of quick and consecutive coming to water; not one who is dilatory]:<br>\
i. e., one coming to water time after time, consecutively: he means, I will do to thee what thou<br>\
dislikest, not delaying to do that. (S.)<br>\
شِرَاكٌ The thong, or strap, of the sandal, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K, TA,) that is on the face thereof, (TA,)<br>\
upon the back [meaning upper side] of the foot,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) [extending from the thong, or strap,<br>\
that passes between two of the toes, towards the<br>\
ankle, and having two arms (its عَضُدَانِ), which<br>\
are attached to the أُذُنَانِ (q. v.), or pass through<br>\
these and unite behind the foot: see also خِزَامَةٌ,<br>\
and فَرَصَهُ, whence it appears to mean also each<br>\
arm, and the two arms, of the شِرَاك properly so<br>\
called: and see سَيْرٌ, where it appears to be used<br>\
as meaning a thong or strap, absolutely:] the<br>\
شِرَاك of the sandal is well known: (O:) pl. شُرُكٌ,<br>\
(O, K, TA,) and accord. to the K أَشْرُكٌ also, but<br>\
this is a mistake. (TA.) To this is likened, in a<br>\
trad., the shadow at the base of a wall, on the<br>\
eastern side thereof, when very small [or narrow],<br>\
showing that the sun has begun to decline from<br>\
the meridian. (Mgh, Msb,) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
streak of herbage: (S, O, K:) pl. شُرُكٌ, (S, O,<br>\
TA,) expl. by AHn as meaning herbage in<br>\
streaks; not continuous. (TA.) One says, الكَلَأُ<br>\
فِى بَنِى فُلَانٍ شُرُكٌ (assumed tropical:)  The herbage among the sons<br>\
of such a one is composed of streaks. (Aboo-Nasr, S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [In the K voce بَنَقَ it is used as<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  A row of shoots, or offsets, cut from<br>\
palm-trees and planted, such as are termed, when<br>\
planted, مُبَنَّقٌ and مُنَبَّقٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,] one says,<br>\
مَضَوْا عَلَى شِرَاكٍ وَاحِدٍ (tropical:)  [They went away in one<br>\
uniform line or manner]. (TA.) And اِجْعَلِ<br>\
الأَمْرَ شِرَاكًا وَاحِدًا (assumed tropical:)  Make thou the affair, or<br>\
case, [uniform, or] one uniform thing. (Fr, TA<br>\
in art. بأج.)<br>\
شَرِيكٌ act. part. n. of شَرِكَةٌ; (Mgh;) i. q.<br>\
↓ مُشَارِكٌ [A sharer, participator, partaker, or<br>\
partner, with another; a copartner, an associate,<br>\
or a colleague, of another]; (K;) and ↓ شِرْكٌ<br>\
signifies the same: (Az, K, TA:) a sharer in<br>\
what is not divided: (K and TK in art. خلط:)<br>\
or a sharer in the rights of a thing that is<br>\
sold: (Mgh in that art.:) pl. شُرَكَآءُ and أَشْرَاكٌ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K, TA,) like شُرَفَآءُ and أَشْرَافٌ pls. of<br>\
شَرِيفٌ; (S, O, TA;) or the latter is pl. of ↓ شِرْكٌ:<br>\
(Az, TA:) a woman is termed شَرِيكَةٌ; (S, O, K;)<br>\
which is applied to a man&#39;s جَارَة [i. e. wife, or<br>\
object of love]; (TA;) and the pl. of this is شَرَائِكُ.<br>\
(S, O, K.) Az mentions his having heard one of<br>\
the Arabs say, فُلَانٌ شَرِيكُ فُلَانٍ meaning Such a<br>\
one is married to the daughter, or to the sister, of<br>\
such a one; what people call the خَتَن [of such a<br>\
one]. (TA.)<br>\
مُشْرِكٌ and ↓ مُشْرِكِىٌّ, (S, O, K,) like as one<br>\
says دَوٌّ and دَوِّىٌّ, and قَعْسَرٌ and قَعْسَرِىٌّ, (S, O,)<br>\
One who attributes to God a شَرِيك [or copartner<br>\
&amp;c., or شُرَكَآء i. e. copartners &amp;c. (see 4)]: (O:)<br>\
[i. e. a believer in a duality, or a plurality, of<br>\
gods:] and [in a wider sense,] a disbeliever [or<br>\
misbeliever] in God. (S, O, K.) Abu-l-&#39;Abbás<br>\
explains [the pl.] مُشْرِكُونَ in the Kur xvi. 102<br>\
as meaning Those who are مشركون by their<br>\
obeying the Devil; by their worshipping God<br>\
and worshipping with Him the Devil. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[In one place, in the CK, the former word is<br>\
erroneously put for مُشْتَرَكٌ, q. v., last sentence.]<br>\
مُشْرِكِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
الفَرِيضَةُ المُشَرَّكَةُ, (O, K, TA,) or المَسْأَلَةُ<br>\
المَشَرَّكَةُ, (Msb,) for المُشَرَّكُ فِيهَا, (Msb, TA,) is<br>\
That [assigned portion of inheritance, or the<br>\
question relating thereto (المَسْأَلَةُ المُشَرَّكَةُ being<br>\
for مَسْأَلَةُ الفَرِيضَةِ المُشَرَّكَةِ),] in which the brothers<br>\
by the mother&#39;s side [only] and those by [both]<br>\
the father&#39;s and the mother&#39;s sides are made to<br>\
share together; (O, Msb, * K, TA;) also called<br>\
↓ المُشَرِّكَةُ [that makes to share], tropically;<br>\
(Msb;) and called also ↓ المُشْتَرَكَةُ [for المُشْتَرَكُ<br>\
فِيهَا i. e. that is shared in]: (Lth, K, TA:) this is<br>\
the case of a husband and a mother and brothers<br>\
by the mother&#39;s side and brothers by the father&#39;s<br>\
and mother&#39;s sides: (O, K, TA:) for the wife is<br>\
half; and for the mother, a sixth; and for the<br>\
brothers by the mother&#39;s side, a third, and the<br>\
brothers by the father&#39;s and mother&#39;s sides share<br>\
with them: (O, TA:) &#39;Omar decided in a case of<br>\
this kind by assigning the third to two brothers<br>\
by the mother&#39;s side, and not assigning anything<br>\
to the brothers by the father&#39;s and mother&#39;s sides;<br>\
whereupon they said, يَا أَمِيرَ المُؤْمِنِينَ هَبْ أَنَّ<br>\
أَبَانَا كَانَ حِمَارًا فَأَشْرِكْنَا بِقَرَابَةِ أُمَّنَا [O Prince of<br>\
the Believers, suppose that our father was an ass,<br>\
and make us to share by reason of the relationship of our mother]: so he made them to share<br>\
together (فَأَشْرَكَ بَيْنَهُمْ [thus in the O and K, but<br>\
correctly فَشَرَّكَ بينهم, or, as afterwards in the TA,<br>\
فَشَرَّكَهُمْ]): (O, K, TA:) therefore it (i. e. the<br>\
فَرِيضَة, TA) was called مُشَرَّكَة [and مُشَرِّكَة] and<br>\
مُشْتَرَكَة, [in the CK, erroneously, مُشْرَكَة,] and<br>\
also حِمَارِيَّة: (K, TA:) and it is also called حَجَرِيَّة,<br>\
because it is related that they said, هَبْ أَنَّ أَبَانَا<br>\
كَانَ حَجَرًا مُلْقًى فِى اليَمِّ [suppose that our<br>\
father was a stone thrown into the sea]; and<br>\
[therefore] some called it يَمِّيَّة: and it was called<br>\
also عُمَرِيَّة. (TA. [More is there added, explaining different decisions of this case.])<br>\
المُشَرِّكَةُ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مُشَارِكٌ: see شَرِيكٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  رِيحٌ مُشَارِكٌ means A<br>\
wind to which the نَكْبَآء [q. v.] is nearer than the<br>\
two winds between which this blows. (K.)<br>\
مُشْتَرَكٌ, applied to a road (طَرِيق, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA), is for مُشْتَرَكٌ فِيهِ, (Msb,) meaning [Shared<br>\
in: or] in which the people are equal [sharers].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, الأَجِيرُ المُشْتَرَكُ [in my copy of<br>\
the Mgh, erroneously, المُشْتَرِكُ,] The hired man<br>\
[that is shared in; i. e.,] whose work no one has<br>\
for himself exclusively of others, but who works<br>\
for every one who repairs to him for work, like<br>\
the tailor in the sitting-places of the markets;<br>\
(Msb;) or who works for whom he pleases: as to<br>\
أَجِيرُ المُشْتَرَكِ, it is not right, unless the word thus<br>\
governed in the gen. case be expl. as an inf. n.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also الفَرِيضَةُ المُشَرَّكَةُ, above. ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
اِسْمٌ مُشْتَرَكٌ [in like manner for مُشْتَرَكٌ فِيهِ A<br>\
noun shared in by several meanings; i. e. a homonym;] a noun shared in by many meanings, such<br>\
as عَيْنٌ and the like: (Mz, 25th نوع; and TA<br>\
in the present art. and in the Intr.:) or مُشْتَرَكٌ<br>\
signifies a word having two, or more, meanings;<br>\
and is applied to a noun, and to the pret. of a verb<br>\
as denoting predication and prayer, and to the<br>\
aor. as denoting the present and the future, and<br>\
to a particle: (Mz ubi suprà:) [مُشْتَرَكٌ used as<br>\
a subst., meaning a homonym, has for its pl.<br>\
مُشْتَرَكَاتٌ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  [الحِسُّ المُشْتَرَكُ, for المُشْتَرَكُ فِيهِ,<br>\
signifies, in the conventional language of the<br>\
philosophers, The faculty of fancy; so called<br>\
because “ participated in ” by the five senses:<br>\
but it is vulgarly used as meaning common sense.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  مُشْتَرَكٌ applied to a man, [for مُشْتَرَكٌ فِيهِ,]<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  Talking to himself, like him who is affected with anxiety; (As, S, K, TA; [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, مُشْرِكٌ;]) his judgment being shared<br>\
in; not one. (TA.)<br>\
