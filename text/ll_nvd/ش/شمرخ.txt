شَمْرَخَ النَّخْلَةَ He stripped off the unripe<br>\
dates of the palm-tree. (L.) And شَمْرِخِ العِذْقَ<br>\
Strip thou the شَمَارِيخ [or fruit-stalks] of the<br>\
raceme of the palm-tree with the مِخْلَب, cutting<br>\
off [the dates]. (L, * K. [In the former, in the<br>\
place of قَطْعًا, the last word in the explanation in<br>\
the K, is put قَعْطًا, app. by a mistake of the<br>\
copyist.])<br>\
شِمْرَاخٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ شُمْرُوخٌ (S,<br>\
Msb, K) A [fruit-] stalk of the raceme of a<br>\
palm-tree; (Mgh;) the عِثْكَال, (S, L,) or thing,<br>\
(Msb,) upon which are the dates; (L, Msb;)<br>\
[i. e. any one of the stalks that branch off from<br>\
the main stem of the raceme, and on which hang<br>\
the dates; each of these stalks comprising a number of dates, one below another:] pl. of both<br>\
شَمَارِيخُ: (Msb:) the عِذْق, or كِبَاسَة, [q. v.,]<br>\
comprises the شَمَارِيخ: (Msb voce عِذْقٌ:) or an<br>\
عِثْكَال upon which are unripe dates, or grapes:<br>\
(K:) originally relating to a raceme of dates; but<br>\
sometimes, to grapes: (L:) and the former word<br>\
[or each] signifies a small bunch of grapes,<br>\
growing apart, but attached to the lower portion<br>\
of the stalk of a larger bunch. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
شِمْرَاخٌ, The head of a mountain: (S, K:) or a<br>\
round, tall, slender head, or peak, of a mountain:<br>\
(L:) accord. to As, [the pl.] شَمَارِيخُ signifies the<br>\
heads of mountains: (TA:) or it signifies the<br>\
upper, or uppermost, part [or parts] of a mountain; and in like manner, of trees. (Ham p. 786.)<br>\
And (assumed tropical:)  The upper, or uppermost, parts of clouds:<br>\
(K:) or [the pl.] شَمَارِيخُ is metaphorically applied to the upper, or uppermost, parts of clouds.<br>\
(Ham ubi suprà.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A blaze upon the face<br>\
of a horse, when it is narrow, (S, K, TA,) and<br>\
long, (TA,) and extending so as to cover the [part<br>\
of the nose called] خَيْشُوم, but not reaching to the<br>\
lip: (S, K, TA:) or a blaze, upon the face of a<br>\
horse, extending downwards on the nose. (Lth,<br>\
TA.) [See غُرَّةٌ سَائِلَةٌ, in art. سيل.] Accord. to J,<br>\
The horse itself [that has such a blaze] is also<br>\
thus called; but this is a mistake: (K:) it seems<br>\
that he meant to have said ذُو شِمْرَاخٍ; but this, in<br>\
a verse which he cites, is the name of a horse of<br>\
Málik Ibn-&#39;Owf En-Nadree, as is said in the K.<br>\
(MF.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [The pl.] الشَّمَارِيخُ is also a name applied by the Arabs to (assumed tropical:)  The stars of Centaurus<br>\
(قَنْطُورُس) and Lepus (السَّبُعُ) collectively. (Kzw.)<br>\
شُمْرُوخٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, first<br>\
sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A slender, and soft or tender,<br>\
branch, that has grown forth, within a year, upon<br>\
the upper part of a thick branch. (L.)<br>\
الشِّمْرَاخِيَّةُ A sect of the heretics, or schismatics,<br>\
(الخَوَارِج,) the companions [or followers] of &#39;AbdAllah Ibn-Shimrákh. (S, K.)<br>\
