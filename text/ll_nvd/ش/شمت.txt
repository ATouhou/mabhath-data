شَمِتَ, aor.<br>\
شَمَتَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. شَمَاتَةٌ<br>\
(S, K) and شَمَاتٌ, (K,) or the former is a simple<br>\
subst., (Msb, [in which no inf. n. is mentioned,])<br>\
He (an enemy) rejoiced: (TA:) or he (a man,<br>\
TA) rejoiced at the affliction of the enemy: (K,<br>\
TA:) you say, شَمِتَ بِهِ He rejoiced at his [an<br>\
enemy&#39;s] affliction. (S, A, Msb.)<br>\
2<br>\
شَمَّتَ see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  تَشْمِيتٌ is syn. with تَسْمِيتٌ: [i. e.]<br>\
تَشْمِيتُ العَاطِسِ signifies The uttering a prayer<br>\
for the sneezer; (S;) when he has, in obedience<br>\
to an injunction of the Prophet, said الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ<br>\
[Praise be to God]: (Har p. 250:) you say,<br>\
شَمَّتَ العَاطِسَ, (ISd, A, TA,) and شمّت عَلَيْهِ,<br>\
meaning [as expl. in art. سمت: or] He prayed<br>\
for the sneezer that he might not be in a state in<br>\
which his enemy might rejoice at his affliction:<br>\
(ISd, TA:) شمّت is better and more common<br>\
than سمّت: (A &#39;Obeyd, TA in art. سمّت and in<br>\
the present art.:) but the latter is said by Th to<br>\
be the original word: or the meaning is, he said<br>\
to the sneezer, May God put away, or avert,<br>\
from thee that on account of which one would<br>\
rejoice at thy affliction: or it is from الشَّوَامِتُ as<br>\
signifying “ the legs ” of a quadruped, as though<br>\
meaning he prayed for the sneezer that he might<br>\
be firm, or steadfast, in his obedience to God.<br>\
(L and TA from the Fáïk &amp;c.) And شمّت لَهُ<br>\
and عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. as above, He prayed for what<br>\
was good for him; prayed for a blessing upon<br>\
him; as also سمّت, but the former is the better<br>\
and the more common. (L and TA from the T<br>\
and Fáïk &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also i. q. تَخْيِيتٌ: (K:) you<br>\
say, شمّتهُ فُلَانٌ, meaning خَيَّبَهُ [Such a one disappointed him; or caused him to be disappointed<br>\
of attaining what he desired or sought: or denied<br>\
him, refused him, prohibited him from attaining,<br>\
or debarred him from, that which he desired or<br>\
sought]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And i. q. جَمْعٌ [The act of<br>\
collecting, &amp;c.]. (K. [But SM says that he had<br>\
searched to the utmost for this meaning without<br>\
finding it in any other lexicon.])<br>\
4<br>\
اشمتهُ اللّٰهُ بِهِ God made him (i. e. the enemy,<br>\
A, Msb) to rejoice at his affliction. (A, * Msb,<br>\
K, TA.) For فَلَا تُشْمِتْ بِىَ الْأَعَدَآءَ [Therefore<br>\
make not thou the enemies to rejoice at my affliction], in the Kur [vii. 149], Mujáhid is related<br>\
to have read ↓ فلا تُشَمِّتْ: but the correctness of<br>\
this is doubted. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَشَمُّتٌ signifies A people&#39;s returning disappointed of attaining their desire, without spoil.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِشْتِمَاتٌ [A camel&#39;s] beginning to be fat. (K.<br>\
[See the part. n., below.])<br>\
شِمَاتٌ Disappointment; frustration of one&#39;s<br>\
endeavour or hope: (IB, TA:) a subst. from<br>\
تَشْمِيتٌ as signifying تَخْيِيبٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
thus written in copies of the K, [and in the S,]<br>\
with kesr, (TA,) [but in the CK شَمات,] and<br>\
↓ شَمَاتَى, (K,) Persons suffering disappointment;<br>\
or failing of attaining their desire; (K, TA;)<br>\
without spoil: (TA:) [pls.] without any sing.;<br>\
(K:) or the latter has no sing. known to ISd:<br>\
(TA:) [but] ↓ شَامِتٌ has this meaning as a sing.<br>\
part, n., and شمات [app. شِمَاتٌ] is its pl. (IB,<br>\
TA.) One says, ↓ رَجَعُوا شَمَاتَى, (IAar, TA,) or<br>\
شِمَاتًا, (S,) They returned suffering disappointment; or failing of attaining their desire; (IAar,<br>\
S, TA;) without spoil; and so ↓ مُشَمَّتِينَ and<br>\
↓ مُتَشَمِّتِينَ. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
شَمِيتٌ Reproach (“ convicium ”): so Golius,<br>\
as from the KL; but I do not find it in my copy<br>\
of that work.]<br>\
شَمَاتَى: see شِمَاتٌ, in two places.<br>\
شَامِتٌ One rejoicing at the affliction of an<br>\
enemy: [fem. with ة: pl. masc. شُمَّاتٌ and fem.<br>\
شَوَامِتُ; or the latter may be anomalously masc.,<br>\
like فَوَارِسُ &amp;c.; and as such it is evidently used<br>\
in the L, in one place; but in another place,<br>\
where it cites an explanation by AO, as fem.:<br>\
both are mentioned in the M and L and TA, and<br>\
the latter in the S and A also.] One says, اَللّٰهُمَّ<br>\
لَا تُطِيعَنَّ لِى شَامِتًا [O God, comply not with the<br>\
desire of one who is to me a rejoicer at my affliction]; meaning, do not with me that which one<br>\
who rejoices at my affliction likes, or approves;<br>\
for in that case, Thou wouldst be as though Thou<br>\
obeyedst him. (ISk, L, TA.) And بَاتَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
بَلَيْلَةِ الشَّوَامِتِ Such a one passed a night such as<br>\
would make to rejoice those, or those females, that<br>\
would rejoice at the affliction of an enemy; (S,<br>\
A, L, TA;) i. e., a distressing night. (A.) [And<br>\
a verse cited in the next paragraph presents, as<br>\
some read it, a similar ex. of الشَّوَامِت.]<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also شِمَاتٌ.<br>\
شَامِتَةٌ [fem. of شَامِتٌ, q. v.<br>\
-A2-  Also], as a subst.,<br>\
sing. of شَوَامِتُ (S, TA) which signifies The legs<br>\
of a beast. (S, A, K, TA.) One says, لَا تَرَكَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
لَهُ شَامِتَةً, i. e. [May God not leave to him] a leg<br>\
of a beast. (AA, S, A, TA.) And En-Nábighah<br>\
[Edh-Dhubyánee] says,<br>\
فَارْتَاعَ مِنْ صَوْتِ كَلَّابٍ فَبَاتَ لَهُ<br>\
طَوْعَ الشَّوَامِتِ مِنْ خَوْفٍ وَمِنْ صَرَدِ<br>\
[And that has been frightened at the voice of a<br>\
huntsman with his dogs,] and passed the night in<br>\
consequence thereof standing, (lit. obeying the<br>\
legs,) by reason of fear and [also] of cold; the<br>\
poet describing a [wild] bull: (AO, L, TA:) but<br>\
some read طَوْعُ (instead of طَوْعَ); and accord. to<br>\
this reading, the meaning is, and passed the night<br>\
having, of fear and of cold, what was agreeable<br>\
with the desire of such as would rejoice at his<br>\
affliction; the phrase being like the saying اَللّٰهُمَّ<br>\
لَا تُطِيعَنَّ لِى شَامِتًا meaning as expl. in the next<br>\
preceding paragraph: (ISk, L, TA:) or he passed<br>\
the night having [of fear and of cold] what would<br>\
rejoice the شَوَامِت that heard thereof: (AO, L,<br>\
TA:) [and in like manner, Z says,] بَاتَ طَوْعَ<br>\
الشَّوَامِتِ [without لَهُ, and with طوع in the accus.<br>\
case, lit. he passed the night obeying those, or those<br>\
females, that rejoiced at his affliction,] means, as<br>\
those that rejoiced at his affliction liked, or approved. (A.)<br>\
مُشَمَّتٌ A king prayed for (K, TA) with the<br>\
prayers that are offered for kings. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also شِمَاتٌ, last sentence.<br>\
مُشَمِّتٌ Any one praying, or who prays, for<br>\
what is good; as also مُسَمِّتٌ. (S.)<br>\
إِبِلٌ مُشْتَمِتَةٌ Camels beginning to be fat. (TA.)<br>\
مُتَشَمِّتٌ: see its pl. voce شِمَاتٌ, last sentence.<br>\
