شَابَهُ, aor. يَشُوبُهُ, (S, A, Msb,) inf. n. شَوْبٌ<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K) and شِيَابٌ, (K,) He mixed it;<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K;) such as milk with water; (Msb;)<br>\
or honey with water. (A.) [And It mingled<br>\
with it: for] one says also, كَأَنَّ رِيقَتَهَا خَمْرٌ يَشُوبُهَا<br>\
عَسَلٌ [As though her saliva were wine with which<br>\
honey mingled]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is sometimes used<br>\
in a good sense, but more frequently in a bad<br>\
sense; and often means He adulterated, vitiated,<br>\
or sophisticated, it.] It is said in a trad., يَشْهَدُ<br>\
بَيْعَكُمُ الحَلِفُ وَاللَّغْوُ فَشُوبُوهُ بِالصَّدَقَةِ (assumed tropical:)  [Swearing,<br>\
and unprofitable speech, attend your selling;<br>\
therefore mix ye it with alms]. (TA.) And it is<br>\
said in a prov., هُوَ يَشُوبُ وَيَرُوبُ (assumed tropical:)  He mixes, or<br>\
confounds, or makes a confusion or disorder, in<br>\
speech and in actions: (S, TA:) or he says right<br>\
one time and wrong another time: (As, TA:) or<br>\
he defends without energy: (TA:) or he is sometimes incited to motion, or action, and defends<br>\
himself, but without energy, and sometimes he is<br>\
motionless, and does not become excited to motion,<br>\
or action; and it is not from [the words شَوْبٌ and<br>\
رَوْبٌ applied to] milk: so says Aboo-Sa&#39;eed [i. e.<br>\
As]: and he says also that شَابَ عَنْهُ وَرَابَ means<br>\
he defended him at one time, and was sluggish, or<br>\
indolent, at another time: and that عنه ↓ شوّب,<br>\
inf. n. تَشْوِيبٌ, means he defended him without<br>\
energy: and thus this latter is expl. in the K, as<br>\
is likewise شاب عنه: also that the Arabs say,<br>\
لَقِيتُ فُلَانًا اليَوْمَ يَشُوبُ عَنْ أَصْحَابِهِ, meaning I<br>\
found such a one to-day defending his companions<br>\
in some measure. (TA.) [See also art. روب.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
شاب also signifies He acted treacherously, perfidiously, or unfaithfully: (Fr, TA:) he lied:<br>\
he deceived in selling or buying: and he acted<br>\
dishonestly, insincerely, or with dissimulation.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [See also Har p. 448; where it is<br>\
implied that it signifies also He spoke truth, or<br>\
was veracious.]<br>\

شَوَّبَ see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْشَوَبَ see what next follows.<br>\
8<br>\
إِشْتَوَبَ اشتاب It was, or became, mixed; (O, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ انشاب. (K.)<br>\
شَوْبٌ inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (S, A, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
لَا شَوْبَ وَلَا رَوْبَ, occurring in a trad., means<br>\
There is, or shall be, no dishonesty, insincerity, or<br>\
dissimulation, nor mixing, in the selling, or<br>\
buying: so says IAar: or I am irresponsible with<br>\
respect to this commodity: or, as he is related to<br>\
have said, thou art irresponsible for its being<br>\
faulty, or defective. (TA. [See also شَوْبَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And شَوْبٌ (TA) and ↓ شِيَابٌ, (S, TA,) [each an<br>\
inf. n. used as a subst. properly so termed,] or<br>\
↓ شِيَابَةٌ, (so in one copy of the S,) signify A<br>\
mixture; an admixture; or a thing mixed with<br>\
another thing. (S, TA.) Thus شَوْبًا signifies in<br>\
the Kur xxxvii. 65: (TA:) or, accord. to one<br>\
reading, the word there is ↓ شُوبًا, meaning a thing<br>\
with which another thing is mixed. (Bd.) الشَّوْبُ<br>\
also signifies [particularly] What is mixed [with<br>\
something else], of water or of milk: (K:) one<br>\
says, سَقَاهُ الذَّوْبَ بِالشَّوْبِ He gave him to drink<br>\
honey with water, or milk, mixed [therewith]:<br>\
(TA:) or سَقَاهُ الشَّوْبَ بِالذَّوْبِ He gave him to<br>\
drink milk [mixed] with honey. (IDrd, TA.)<br>\
And Mixed honey; as in the saying, مَا عِنْدِى<br>\
شَوْبٌ وَلَا رَوْبٌ I have not mixed honey nor milk<br>\
such as is termed رَائِب [q. v.]: (IAar, TA:) or<br>\
[simply] honey &amp;c.; (A, Msb, TA;) so called because they mix it with beverages; (Msb;) as in the<br>\
saying, سَقَاهُ الشَّوْبَ بِالرَّوْبِ He gave him to drink<br>\
honey with clarified butter, or with milk. (A.)<br>\
And Broth; as in the saying, مَا عِنْدَهُ شَوْبٌ وَلَا رَوْبٌ<br>\
He has not broth nor milk. (S, K: but in the<br>\
latter, مَا لَهُ.) And شَوْبٌ signifies also A piece of<br>\
dough. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And [the pl.] أَشْوَابٌ signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A medley, or mixed multitude, of sundry sorts:<br>\
a less particular term than أَوْبَاشٌ, which signifies<br>\
a medley, or mixed multitude, of the low, or<br>\
lower, or lowest, sort: (TA, from a trad.:) accord.<br>\
to El-Jawáleekee, it is an arabicized word, from<br>\
the Pers. آشُوبٌ. (TA in art. وشب.)<br>\
شُوبٌ: see شُوبًا in the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
شَوْبَةٌ Deceit, delusion, guile, or circumvention:<br>\
(K: [see also شَوْبٌ:]) [or, app., somewhat thereof:] one says, فِى فُلَانٍ شَوْبَةٌ [In such a one is<br>\
deceit, &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
شَيْبَآءُ A virgin in the night of her devirgination: (Ibn-Abi-l-Hadeed, MF:) [either from<br>\
شَابَ having for its aor. يَشُوبُ, signifying “ he<br>\
mixed,” or from شَابَ having for its aor. يَشِيبُ,<br>\
signifying “ he became white-headed, or hoary; ”<br>\
as shown by what follows:] one says, بَاتَتْ<br>\
بِلَيْلَةِ شَيْبَآءَ, (S and A in art. شيب, and K in the<br>\
present art.,) and بِلَيْلَةِ الشَّيْبَآءِ, (K,) She passed<br>\
the night of a virgin then devirginated, (S, A,<br>\
K,) and of the virgin then devirginated: (K,<br>\
TA:) said of a virgin-bride when she is devirginated by the bridegroom in the night in which<br>\
she has been first brought to him: (A, K, TA:)<br>\
in the contr. case, when she is not devirginated,<br>\
one says, بَاتَتْ بِلَيْلَةِ حُرَّةٍ: (S, TA:) and one says<br>\
also, بِلَيْلَةٍ شَيْبَآءَ and بِلَيْلَةٍ حُرَّةٍ: (TA in art. حر:)<br>\
Z, in the A, mentions the first phrase in art. شيب,<br>\
and makes it to be tropical, as though the bride<br>\
were in that night afflicted by an event so severe<br>\
as to cause the locks of her hair to become white:<br>\
in the L it is said that the ى in شيباء is substituted<br>\
for و, because of [the allusion of the phrase to]<br>\
the mixing of the sperma genitale of the man with<br>\
that of the woman; but that ٰشَوْبَآء has not been<br>\
heard instead of شيباء: ISd, in the M, mentions it<br>\
in arts. شوب and شيب; observing that the ى is<br>\
said to take the place of و: J, as well as Z and<br>\
others, mentions it in art. شيب [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
شِيَابٌ and شِيَابَةٌ: see شَوْبٌ.<br>\
شَائِبَةٌ sing. of شَوَائِبُ meaning The whiteness<br>\
[mixing] with the darkness of night. (Har p.<br>\
58.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The saying لَيْسَ فِيهِ شَائِبَةُ مُلْكٍ may be<br>\
from شَابَهُ “ he mixed it; ” meaning There is not<br>\
in it anything [of ownership, or right of possession,] mixed therewith, though small, or however<br>\
small; like as one says, لَيْسَ فِيهِ عُلْقَةٌ وَلَا شُبْهَةٌ; it<br>\
being an instance of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ in the<br>\
sense of the measure مَفْعُولَةٌ, as in عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ:<br>\
thus the lawyers use it. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  شَائِبَةٌ is also<br>\
sing. of شَوَائِبُ meaning Uncleannesses, filths, or<br>\
pollutions; or unclean, filthy, or foul, things. (S,<br>\
Msb, K. *)<br>\
مَشُوبٌ (S, Msb) and مَشِيبٌ, the latter from شِيب<br>\
[“ it was mixed ”], Mixed. (S, Msb.) A poet<br>\
says, (namely, Suleyk Ibn-Es-Sulakeh EsSaadee, TA,)<br>\
وَمَآءُ قُدُورٍ فِى القِصَاعِ مَشِيبُ<br>\
i. e. [And the water of cooking-pots, in the<br>\
wooden bowls,] mixed with seeds for seasoning and<br>\
with sauces. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الفَتْحَةُ المَشُوبَةُ بِالكَسْرَةِ means<br>\
[The fet-hah that is mingled with kesreh; which<br>\
is] the fethah that precedes the ا of إِمَالَة; as in<br>\
عَابِدٌ and عَارِفٌ [when they are pronounced<br>\
“ &#39;ébidun ” and “ &#39;érifun ”]; for امالة consists in<br>\
inclining [the sound of] fet-hah towards [that of]<br>\
kesreh; whereby [the sound of] the ا that follows<br>\
it is inclined, and is not a pure ا; for like as [the<br>\
sound of] the fet-hah is mingled [with that of<br>\
kesreh], so is [the sound of] the ا [mingled with<br>\
that of ى]. (L, TA.)<br>\
مُشَاوَبٌ, with damm [to the م], and fet-h to the<br>\
و, [not with both of these vowels to the و as<br>\
supposed by Freytag,] The case (غِلَاف) of a flash<br>\
or bottle; (K;) because it is mixed with redness<br>\
and yellowness and greenness; mentioned by<br>\
AHát on the authority of As: (TA:) pl. مَشَاوِبُ:<br>\
(AHát, K:) or the pl. signifies [receptacles of the<br>\
sorts called] أَسْفَاط [pl. of سَفَطٌ] and حُقَق [pl. of<br>\
حُقَّةٌ] made of palm-leaves. (A.)<br>\
