شَقَّهُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
شَقُ3َ, (M, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. شَقٌّ, (S, M, Msb,) He cut it [or divided<br>\
it] lengthwise; (TA in art. قد;) [i. e.] he clave<br>\
it, split it, rived or rifted it, or slit it; so as to<br>\
separate it; [i. e. he clave, split, rived or rifted,<br>\
slit, rent, ripped, tore, broke, or burst, it asunder;]<br>\
or without separating it; [i. e. he cracked, chapped, incided or incised, gashed, slashed, furrowed,<br>\
or trenched, it; or clave, split, &amp;c., or cut, it<br>\
open;] syn. صَدَعَهُ; (K;) or [more explicitly]<br>\
الشَّقُّ signifies الصَّدْعُ البَائِنُ [the cleaving &amp;c. that<br>\
separates]; or غَيْرُ البَائِنِ [that which does not<br>\
separate]; or الصَّدْعُ [the cleaving, &amp;c.,] in a<br>\
general sense: (M:) and in like manner, [but<br>\
with an intensive signification, or implying frequency or repetition of the action, or its application to several objects, generally meaning he clave<br>\
it, &amp;c., much, or in pieces, or in several places,]<br>\
↓ شقّقهُ: (M, K:) you say, شقّق الحَطَبَ (S, K)<br>\
وَغَيْرَهُ (S) i. e. شَقَّهُ [but properly meaning He<br>\
clave in pieces the firewood &amp;c.]. (K. [In the<br>\

الحطب.]) ―<br>\

-b3-  شَقَّ العَصَا [lit. He split<br>\
the staff] means (tropical:)  he separated himself from the<br>\
community; (S, K, TA;) and particularly, that of<br>\
the Muslims: because the staff is not thus called<br>\
but when it is whole, not when it is split: accord.<br>\
to Lth, يَشُقُّ عَصَا المُسْلِمِينَ and ↓ يُشَاقُّهُمْ signify<br>\
alike: but they differ in meaning, as will be<br>\
shown hereafter. (TA.) شَقَّ عَصَا المُسْلِمِينَ, K,<br>\
TA,) said of a خَارِجِىّ [i. e. heretic or schismatic],<br>\
also means (assumed tropical:)  He effected disunion and dissension<br>\

of allegiance, or obedience; became a rebel]. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  لَا وَالَّذِى شَقَّ الرِّجَالَ لِلْخَيْلِ وَالجِبَالَ لِلسَّيْلِ<br>\
[app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  No, by Him who clave men for<br>\
the riding upon horses, and the mountains for the<br>\
flowing of the torrent,] is a saying mentioned by<br>\

added, وَعِنْدِى أَنَّهُ جَعَلَ الرِّجَالَ وَالجِبَالَ جُمْلَةً<br>\
وَاحِدَةً ثُمَّ خَرَقَهُمَا فَجَعَلَ الرِّجَالَ لِهٰذِهِ وَالجِبَالَ لِهٰذَا:<br>\
an expression of opinion which is, to me, by no<br>\
means clear, though reconcilable with my rendering.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  المَالُ بَيْنَنَا شَقَّ الأَبْلَمَةِ and الأُبْلُمَةِ [The<br>\
property is divided between us as in the dividing<br>\
of the ابلمة; or the cattle are divided &amp;c.;] means<br>\
we are equal in respect of the property, or cattle:<br>\
for the ابلمة means the [kind of leaf called]<br>\
خُوصَة, which, when it is split lengthwise, splits<br>\
in halves: (M:) or, accord. to Aboo-Ziyád, the<br>\
ابلمة is a herb, or leguminous plant, (بَقْلَةٌ,) to<br>\
which there come forth pods, like [those of] the<br>\
bean; and when you split them lengthwise, they<br>\
split in halves, equally, from the first part to the<br>\
last thereof: شَقَّ is in the accus. case as an inf. n.,<br>\
مَشْقُوقٌ being understood. (Har p. 639.) [See<br>\

like manner, (TA,) meaning it made its first<br>\
appearance: (M:) and said also of a plant, [as<br>\
meaning it came forth] on the ground&#39;s first<br>\

signifies the being in a شِقّ [or side] other than<br>\

cloven (Bd, Jel) in twain, (Jel,) as a sign to the<br>\
Prophet: (Bd, Jel:) or shall be cloven on the day<br>\

مِنَ الغَضَبِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one was as though his interior<br>\

the thing. (TK.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  The taking [or deriving] a word from a word, (S, K,) with the<br>\
condition of reciprocal relation in meaning and<br>\
[radical] composition, and of reciprocal difference<br>\

is that derivation in which there is a reciprocal<br>\
relation between the two words in the letters and<br>\
in the order [thereof]; as in ضَرَبَ from الضَّرْبُ:<br>\
الاشتقاق الكَبِيرُ is that in which there is a reciprocal<br>\
relation between the two words as to the letter<br>\
and the meaning, exclusively of the order; as in<br>\
جَبَذَ from الجَذْبُ: الاشتقاق الأَكْبَرُ is that in<br>\
which there is a reciprocal relation between the<br>\
two words in the place [or places] of utterance;<br>\
as in نَعَقَ from النَّهْقُ. (KT.) [You say, اشتقّ<br>\
حَرْفًا or كَلِمَةً or لَفْظًا, and اسْمًا, He derived a<br>\
word, and a name, مِنْ آخَرَ from another; and<br>\
↓ شَقَّهُ sometimes signifies the same, as is shown<br>\

-b3-  [And, as syn. with<br>\
اِخْتِرَاعٌ, (see 8 in art. خرع,)] The constructing, or<br>\

in speech, and in contention, or disputation, or<br>\
litigation: (S, K, TA:) or اِشْتِقَاقُ الكَلَامِ signifies<br>\
the taking to the right and left in speech: (so in<br>\
a copy of the M: [but I think that the right<br>\
reading is الاِشْتِقَاقُ فِى الكَلَامِ, agreeably with<br>\
what here follows:]) you say, اشتقّ فِى الكَلَامِ, and<br>\
فِى الخُصُومَةِ. (TK.) See also 6. And [in like<br>\
manner] one says of a horse, اشتقّ فِى عَدْوِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\

one of his two sides (عَلَى أَحَدِ شِقَّيْهِ), in order to<br>\

by Freytag, is expl. by Jac. Schultens, but on<br>\
what authority is not said, as signifying “ Prodiit,<br>\
manifestus evasit. ”]<br>\

that] the primary meaning of شَقْشَقَةٌ is Loudness<br>\
of voice; or the being loud in voice. (JK.) ―<br>\

TA:) or one says of a sparrow, يُشَقْشِقُ فِى صَوْتِهِ<br>\
[app. meaning It makes a loud twittering in its<br>\
cry]. (S.)<br>\
شَقٌّ sing. of شُقُوقٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) originally an inf. n.; (S, Msb;) An opening forming an<br>\
interstice in a thing: (Msb:) or a fissure, cleft,<br>\
chink, split, slit, rent, crack, or the like, syn.<br>\

an incision, a gash, or a furrow, or trench]: (M,<br>\
K:) as though an inf. n. used as a subst. in this<br>\
sense: pl. as above, شُقُوقٌ: (M:) it differs from<br>\
شُقَاقٌ, (S, Mgh,) by having a general signification: (Mgh:) accord. to Yaakoob, one says,<br>\
بِيَدِ فُلَانٍ شُقُوقٌ (S, Mgh) and بِرِجْلِهِ (S) [i. e. In<br>\
the hand, or arm, of such a one are cracks, or the<br>\
like, and in his foot, or leg]: but [it is asserted<br>\
that in this case] one should not say شُقَاقٌ: (S,<br>\
Mgh: [see, however, this word:]) and hence,<br>\
شَقُّ القَبْرِ The trench, or oblong excavation, in the<br>\

signifies صُدُوع [i. e. fissures, &amp;c.,] in mountains,<br>\

divided lengthwise; (M;) as also ↓ شِقَّةٌ. (AHn,<br>\
S, * M, K.) One says, أَخَذْتُ شِقَّ الشَّاةِ and ↓ شِقَّةَ<br>\

TA:) the vulgar pronounce the ش with fet-h.<br>\
(TA.) And خُذْ هٰذَا الشِّقَّ Take thou this ↓ شِقَّة<br>\
[i. e. half] of the sheep or goat. (TA.) Hence<br>\
the trad., تَصَدَّقُوا وَلَوْ بِشِقِّ تَمْرَةٍ i. e. [Give ye<br>\
alms though it be but] the half of a date; meaning<br>\
deem not anything little that is given as alms.<br>\
(TA.) And المَالُ بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَكَ شِقَّ الشَّعَرَةِ and<br>\
الشَّعَرَةِ ↓ شَقَّ, (O, K, * [in the CK and in my MS.<br>\
copy of the K شقُّ, but the former reading appears<br>\
to be the right, شَقَّ being an inf. n. as in a similar<br>\
saying in the former half of the first paragraph of<br>\
this art., and شِقَّ being a subst. used as an inf. n.<br>\
or for كَشِقِّ,]) meaning [The property is between<br>\
us] two halves, equal [in division]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\

having the form of the half of a human being.<br>\
(Kzw in his Descr. of the Jinn.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The lateral<br>\
half, or half and side; as when one says that a<br>\
person paralyzed has a شِقّ inclining; and as<br>\

either of the two dorsers, or panniers, or oblong<br>\
chests, which are borne, one on either side, by a<br>\
camel, and which, with a small tent over them,<br>\
compose a مَحْمِل: see this last word, and مَحَارَةٌ].<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The side of the body; as when one<br>\
says of a person that his left شِقّ was grazed, or<br>\

K, TA,) of a thing; the two sides of a thing<br>\
being called شِقَّاهُ: (Lth, TA:) or, as some say,<br>\

one says, فُلَانٌ مِنْ شِقِّ العَشِيرَةِ لَا مِنْ صَمِيمِهَا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Such a one is of the collateral class of the<br>\
kinsfolk, or tribe, not of the main stock thereof].<br>\
(Mgh in art. عرض.) ―<br>\
-b6-  I. q. ↓ شَقِيقٌ; (S, Msb,<br>\
K;) [which primarily signifies The cloven-off<br>\
half of a thing; i. e.,] when a thing is cloven in<br>\
halves, each of the halves is called the شَقِيق of the<br>\
other. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [And hence, (assumed tropical:)  The counterpart of a person or thing: and this appears to be<br>\
meant by J, and accord. to SM in the K, where<br>\
it is said that شِقٌّ is syn. with ↓ شَقِيقٌ; for they<br>\
add immediately after:] one says هُوَ أَخِى وَشِقُّ<br>\
نَفْسِى (tropical:)  [He is my brother, and the counterpart of<br>\
myself]; (S, TA;) as though he were cloven<br>\
from me, because of the resemblance of each of<br>\
us to the other. (TA.) One says also, هذَا<br>\
↓ شَقِيقُهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  This is the like of him, or it.<br>\
(TA.) And [hence] it is said in a trad., النِّسَآءُ<br>\
شَقَائِقُ الرِّجَالِ, [in which شَقَائِقُ is the pl. of ↓ شَقِيقٌ<br>\
as fem., or of شَقِيقَةٌ in the same sense,] meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Women are the likes of men in natural dispositions; as though they were cloven from them;<br>\
or because Eve was created from Adam. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  And (tropical:)  A man&#39;s brother; (M;) and so ↓ شَقِيقٌ;<br>\
(S, M, O, K, TA;) meaning a brother by the<br>\
father and mother; (TA;) from شَقِيقٌ as meaning<br>\
“ either half of a thing that is cloven in halves; ”<br>\
(S, TA;) or as though the relationship of one<br>\
were cloven from that of the other: (IDrd, O,<br>\
K:) pl. of the latter أَشِقَّآءُ. (M, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And a<br>\
name for A thing at which one looks: (Lth, O,<br>\
K:) [but this is app. taken from the following<br>\
saying of Lth, in which I think الشِّقُّ is a mistranscription for الشَّقُّ, meaning “ the crack,” &amp;c.:]<br>\
الشَّقُّ is the inf. n. of شَقَقْتُ, and الشِّقُّ is a name<br>\
for that at which one looks [i. e. for the visible<br>\
effect of the act signified by the verb], and the pl.<br>\
is الشُّقُوقُ [which is well known as the pl. of الشَّقُّ].<br>\
(JK.)<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. ↓ مَشَقَّةٌ (S, M, O, Msb, K) i. e.<br>\
Difficulty, hardship, distress, affliction, trouble,<br>\
inconvenience, fatigue, or weariness; (M, TA;)<br>\
and languor, or lack of power, that overtakes the<br>\
mind and the body; (Er-Rághib, TA;) and so<br>\
↓ شَقٌّ; (IJ, S, M, O, K;) thus it is sometimes<br>\
pronounced with fet-h; mentioned by A&#39;Obeyd;<br>\
(S;) and by AZ; (M;) or this is an inf. n., and<br>\
شِقٌّ is the subst.; (O, K;) and ↓ شُقَّةٌ and ↓ شِقَّةٌ<br>\
also signify the same as مَشَقَّةٌ, (K,) or such as<br>\
overtakes a man in consequence of travel; (TA;)<br>\
and the pls. of these two are شُقَقٌ, (K, TA,) mentioned by Fr, (TA,) and شِقَقٌ, (K, TA,) mentioned on the authority of some one or more of<br>\
[the tribe of] Keys: (TA:) the pl. of ↓ مَشَقَّةٌ is<br>\
مَشَاقُّ and مَشَقَّاتٌ. (TA.) Hence, in the Kur<br>\
[xvi. 7], لَمْ تَكُونُوا بَالِغِيهِ إِلَّا بِشِقِ الْأَنْفُسِ [Which<br>\
ye would not reach save with difficulty, or distress, &amp;c., of the souls]; where some read ↓ بِشَقِّ.<br>\
(S, * TA.)<br>\
شُقَّةٌ primarily signifies The half of a garment<br>\
[consisting of two oblong pieces sewed together,<br>\
side by side]: then it was applied to [such] a<br>\
garment as it is [when complete: in both of these<br>\
senses it is used in the present day]: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) or a piece (قِطْعَةٌ) of a garment: (Mgh:)<br>\
or the شُقَّة of ثِيَاب [thus, and thus only, in the S,<br>\
meaning of garments and of cloths, for it is of<br>\
both,] is an oblong piece; syn. سَبِيبَةٌ مُسْتَطِيلَةٌ:<br>\
(M, K:) [it is often applied to an oblong piece of<br>\
cloth of those pieces of which a tent is composed:]<br>\
pl. شُقَقٌ and شِقَاقٌ. (M, Mgh, TA.) One says,<br>\
فُلَانٌ يَبِيعُ شِقَاقَ الكَتَّانِ [Such a one sells pieces,<br>\
or oblong pieces, &amp;c., of linen]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
A piece of a مَزَادَة [q. v.]. (B, TA in art. بصر.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And A piece, or portion, [or tract,] of Hell;<br>\
likewise pronounced ↓ شِقَّةٌ. (Ham p. 816.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And A far journey; as also ↓ شِقَّةٌ, (S, M, K,)<br>\
sometimes thus pronounced with kesr: (S:) a far,<br>\
long journey: a far-extending space: (TA:) or a<br>\
road difficult to him who travels it: (Mgh:) or<br>\
[simply] a journey: and i. q. ثنيا [so in my copy<br>\
of the Msb, app. a mistranscription for ثَنِيَّة, i. e.<br>\
a mountain-road, &amp;c.]: pl. شُقَقٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
A part, region, quarter, or tract, (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh,<br>\
Er-Rághib, K, TA,) towards which one draws<br>\
near, (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, TA,) or towards which the<br>\
traveller directs himself, (K, TA,) [like شُكَّةٌ,]<br>\
or in the reaching of which one is overtaken by<br>\
difficulty, or distress; (Er-Rághib, TA;) And<br>\
↓ شِقَّةٌ signifies the same. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And Distance;<br>\
and so ↓ شِقَّةٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  See also شِقٌّ, last sentence<br>\
but one.<br>\
شِقَّةٌ A splinter (S, K) that splits off, (S,) or a<br>\
piece (M, Mgh, TA) split off, (M, TA,) of a<br>\

piece of wood, (S, Mgh,) or other thing: (M,<br>\
TA:) a piece split, or divided, lengthwise, of a<br>\
staff, or stick, and of a garment, or piece of cloth,<br>\
&amp;c.: (IDrd, O, K:) and a piece split (K, TA)<br>\
from anything; such as the half: (TA:) pl.<br>\
شِقَقٌ. (O, TA.) One says of him who is angry,<br>\
اِحْتَدَّ فَطَارَتْ مِنْهُ شِقَّةٌ فِى الأَرْضِ وَشِقَّةٌ فِى السَّمَآءِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [He became excited by sharpness of temper, or<br>\
angriness, and he was as though a bit flew from<br>\
him upon the ground, and a bit into the sky].<br>\

See also شِقٌّ, first three sentences. ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
شُقَّةٌ, in four places. ―<br>\

شُقَاقٌ A cracking in several places, (تَشَقُّقٌ, S,<br>\
K,) or cracks, (Mgh,) or a certain disease occasioning cracks, (M,) in the pasterns of horses or<br>\
the like, (S, M, Mgh, K,) and in their hoofs, (M,<br>\
Mgh,) and sometimes rising to their shanks: so<br>\
says Yaakoob: (S:) and, accord. to Lth, (Mgh,)<br>\
and Az, (TA,) a cracking in several places<br>\
(تَشَقُّقٌ) of the skin, from cold or some other cause,<br>\
in the hands or arms, and the face: (Mgh, TA:)<br>\

from disease: (M, TA:) As says that it is in the<br>\
hand or arm, and the foot or leg, of a human<br>\
being, and in the fore leg and kind leg of an<br>\
animal: (Mgh, TA:) but this is inconsistent<br>\
with what is said by Yaakoob [as stated voce<br>\
شَقٌّ, first sentence]. (Mgh.) See also أَسْعَدُ: and<br>\

شَقِيقٌ: see شِقٌّ, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  شَقِيقُ البَرْقِ [so<br>\

as meaning Lightning that cleaves the clouds, and<br>\

or third, year]. (JK.)<br>\
شَقُوقَةٌ A certain bird; also called ↓ شَقِيقَةٌ: (M,<br>\
K:) and ↓ شُقَيِّقَةٌ is the dim. thereof: (K:) AHát<br>\
says, the ↓ شَقُوقَة is a very little thing, grayish<br>\
(زُرَيْقَآءُ), of the colour of ashes; ten and fifteen of<br>\
what are thus called congregate; and I think it<br>\
to be the ↓ شُقَيِّقَة, which is a دُخَّلَة of the دُخَّل<br>\
[q. v.]; it is somewhat dusky; and its form is the<br>\
form of these, but it is smaller than they: it is<br>\
called ↓ شُقَيِّقَة becanse of its smallness: IDrd, in<br>\
the class of فُعَيْعِل, mentions ↓ الشُّقَيِّقُ as signifying<br>\
a certain species of birds [app. as a coll. gen. n.,<br>\
of which the n. un. is with ة]. (O, TA.)<br>\

by an Arab of the desert, (TA,) producing herbage: (S, M, O, K:) or a rugged tract between<br>\
two elongated, or extended, tracts of sand, producing good herbage; (M, TA;) so in the T, as<br>\
expl. to its author by an Arab of the desert:<br>\
(TA:) pl. شَقَائِقُ, (T, S, O, K, TA,) expl. by<br>\
some as meaning sands themselves: (TA:) or a<br>\
great piece of sand: or a piece of sand between<br>\
two pieces thereof. (Ham p. 282.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [In the A<br>\
and TA voce قِطُّ, it is used as meaning A slice cut<br>\
off of a melon &amp;c.]<br>\
-A2-  A rain, (M,) or a violent<br>\
rain, consisting of large drops, (K, TA,) wide in<br>\

The pl., شَقَائِقُ, is expl. by Az as signifying<br>\
Clouds that have cloven asunder with copious<br>\
rains. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  شَقِيقَةُ بَرْقٍِ, (O, K,) and عَقِيقَتُهُ,<br>\
both as expl. by Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, (O,) A flash of<br>\
lightning that has spread (O, K) in the horizon,<br>\
(O,) or from the horizon: (K: [but see شَقِيقُ<br>\
البَرْقِ:]) or شَقِيقَةٌ signifies a flash of lightning that<br>\
has spread in the breadth of the clouds, and filled<br>\
the sky: pl. as above. (Ham p. 557.)<br>\
-A3-  A headache, (JK, T, TA,) or a pain, (S, O, K,) or a<br>\
certain disease, (M,) in the half of the head, (JK,<br>\
T, S, M, O, K,) [i. e. hemicrania,] and of the<br>\
face: (JK, T, S, O, K:) or, accord. to IAth, a<br>\
sort of headache in the fore part of the head and<br>\
towards the sides thereof. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  شَقَائِقُ النُّعْمَانِ,<br>\
used alike as sing. and pl., (S, O, K,) having no<br>\
proper sing., (Msb,) or its sing. is شَقِيقَةٌ; (M, O,<br>\
Msb;) [The red, or blood-coloured, anemone;] a<br>\
certain plant; (M;) a certain red flower; (Lth,<br>\
O;) well known; (S, K;) the شَقِر; (Msb;) or, as<br>\
AHn says, on the authority of AA and Aboo-Nasr and others, it is the شَقِرَة [n. un. of شَقِرٌ];<br>\
and the sing. of شقائق is شَقِيقَةٌ: (O, TA:) it is<br>\
called شقائق النعمان because of its redness, as<br>\
being likened to the شَقِيقَة of lightning: (M, K:)<br>\
or from النُّعْمَان as meaning “ blood,” as resembling<br>\
blood in colour; (Msb, TA;) so that it signifies<br>\
“ pieces of blood: ” (TA:) or in relation to En-Noamán Ibn-El-Mundhir, because he prohibited<br>\
to the public a piece of land in which it abounded:<br>\
(S, K, TA:) or because he alighted upon شَقَائِق<br>\
of sand that had produced red شَقِر, and he deemed<br>\
them beautiful, and commanded that they should<br>\
be prohibited to the public; so the شَقِر were called<br>\
the شقائق of En-Noamán, by the name of the<br>\
place of their growth. (TA.)<br>\
-A5-  See also شَقُوقَةٌ.<br>\
شُقَيِّقٌ, and with ة: see شَقُوقَةٌ, in four places.<br>\
شَقَّاقٌ, meaning One who glories, or boasts,<br>\
vainly, and praises himself for that which is not<br>\

protrudes from his mouth when he is excited by<br>\
lust; (S, O, K;) a skin in the fauces of the<br>\
Arabian camel, which he inflates with wind, and<br>\
in which he brays; whereupon it appears from<br>\
the side of his mouth; so says En-Nadr; and he<br>\
adds that it does not pertain to any but the<br>\
Arabian camel, [as is said in the M, and] as Hr<br>\
says; but this requires consideration; (TA;) [also<br>\
expl. as] the لَهَاة [q. v.] of the he-camel, (M, and<br>\
Har p. 16,) which he protrudes from his mouth<br>\
when he brays: (Har ubi suprá:) pl. شَقَاشِقُ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  To this is likened the tongue of the<br>\
chaste, or eloquent, and able speaker; himself<br>\
being likened to the braying stallion-camel: (O:)<br>\
and hence they say of an orator, or a preacher,<br>\
that he is ذُو شِقْشِقَةٍ: (S:) one says likewise of an<br>\
orator, or a preacher, that is loud in voice and<br>\
skilful in speech, هُوَ أَهْرَتُ الشِقْشِقَةِ [lit. He is wide,<br>\
or ample, in respect of the شقشقة]: (TA:) and<br>\
one says, هَدَرَتْ شِقْشِقَتُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [meaning His utterance<br>\
was sonorous and fluent]. (A and TA in art.<br>\
هدر.) Orators, or preachers, are also termed<br>\
شَقَاشِق [for ذَوُو شَقَاشِقَ]: and one says, فُلَانٌ<br>\
شِقْشِقَةُ قَوْمِهِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is the noble,<br>\
and the chaste in speech, or eloquent, of his<br>\
people. (M.) And in a trad. of &#39;Omar, (M, O,<br>\
TA,) accord. to A&#39;Obeyd and others, or of &#39;Alee<br>\
accord. to Hr, (TA,) شَقَاشِق are assigned to the<br>\
Devil, in his saying, إِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِنَ الخُطَبِ مِنْ<br>\
شَقَاشِقِ الشَّيْطَانِ [lit. Verily many of the orations,<br>\
or harangues, are from the شقاشق of the Devil];<br>\
because of the lying introduced into them. (M,<br>\
O, * TA. *)<br>\
الخُطْبَةُ الشِّقْشِقِيَّةُ an appellation applied to a<br>\
certain خُطْبَة [i. e. oration, or harangue, or sermon,] of &#39;Alee, because of his saying to Ibn-<br>\

speech, (O,) in reply to a remark of the latter<br>\
person upon his not having continued his speech<br>\
uninterruptedly, تِلْكَ شِقْشِقَةٌ هَدَرَتْ ثُمَّ قَرَّتْ [That<br>\
was a شقشقة that uttered a braying, then became<br>\
still]. (O, K.)<br>\
شَاقٌّ Difficult, hard, distressing, grievous, afflicting, troubling, molesting, fatiguing, or wearying. (KL.) One says أَمْرٌ شَاقٌّ [An affair, or<br>\
event, that is difficult, &amp;c.]; from شَقَّ عَلَيْنَا الأَمْرُ.<br>\
