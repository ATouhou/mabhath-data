account of the protruding of her womb on the<br>\
occasion of her bringing forth; (M, O, K;) syn.<br>\
of the inf. n. تَزْنِيدٌ. (S.) See also شِصَارٌ, below.<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And شَصَرَ النَّاقَةَ, (K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,)<br>\
signifies also He inserted the piece of wood called<br>\

شَخَصَ,) and the eye became inverted; at the time<br>\
of death: (O, K:) thus, nearly in the same words,<br>\
expl. by Lth and IF and Ibn-&#39;Abbád: (O:) or the<br>\
correct word is شَصَا, or شَطَرَ; (so accord. to<br>\
different copies of the K, the latter being the<br>\
reading in the TA;) or both; for Az says that<br>\
this explanation of شصر بصره is in his opinion a<br>\
mistake, and that it is correctly شَصَا بَصَرُهُ and<br>\
شَطَرَ, meaning that he was as though he looked at<br>\
thee and at another. (O, TA. *)<br>\

when he has become strong and active: (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\

that has become old enough to smite with his<br>\
horn: or that has become a month old: or that<br>\
has not yet cropped the herbage [but only sucked<br>\
his mother]; expl. by الَّذِى لَمْ يَحْتَنِكْ: (K:)<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd states that it is said by more than one of<br>\
the Arabs of the desert that the young one of the<br>\
gazelle is called طَلًا; then, خِشْفٌ; and when his<br>\
horns come forth, شَادِنٌ; and when he has become<br>\
strong and active, شَصَرٌ, of which the fem. [as is<br>\
also said in the K] is شَصَرَةٌ; then, جَذَعٌ; and<br>\
then, ثَنِىٌّ, which name he continues to have<br>\
until he dies: (S:) [perhaps correctly corresponding to our six terms which are as follows: a fawn<br>\
(applied to a buck or doe of the first year), a<br>\
pricket (to a buck of the second year), a sorel<br>\
(to a buck of the third year), a sore (to a buck of<br>\

or prickle, (K,) or the small sharp-pointed pieces<br>\
of wood, or prickles, (IDrd, S,) with which the<br>\
operation termed تَزْنِيدٌ [which is that described<br>\
above in the explanation of شَصَرَ النَّاقَةَ] is performed; (IDrd, S, K;) as also ↓ شِصْرٌ: (K:) or<br>\
↓ شِصْرَانِ, or شِصَارَانِ, is a term applied to two<br>\
pieces of wood, which are thrust through the edge<br>\
of the rectum of a she-camel, and then bound with<br>\
a strong string of the fibres of the palm-tree,<br>\
behind them: this is done when they desire to<br>\
make a she-camel affect the young one of another:<br>\
they take a stuffed دُرْجَة [q. v.], and insert it into<br>\
her rectum, and transfix the rectum with two<br>\
sharp-pointed pieces of wood, which they bind as<br>\
above described: this operation is termed ↓ شَصْرٌ<br>\
and تَزْنِيدٌ. (ISh.) [See also 1.] ―<br>\

شُصُوٌّ, (S, TA, and so in copies of the K, accord.<br>\
to the CK شَصْوٌ, [and this, though wrong, is<br>\
agreeable with a rule generally observed in the<br>\
K, as it is not there followed by any indication of<br>\
the form,]) like عُلُوٌّ, (TA,) His eye, or eyes,<br>\
became fixedly open, or raised, or stretched and<br>\
raised, or his eyelids became raised and he looked<br>\
intently and became disquieted or disturbed, syn.<br>\

1َ2ُ3َ; and<br>\
and شَصِىَ aor.<br>\
1َ2َ3َ; (K;) but this last requires<br>\
consideration, differing as it does from what is in<br>\
the S [without any allusion to the latter&#39;s being<br>\
wrong]; (TA; [see also شَظَى;]) said of a corpse;<br>\
(Ks, S, K;) Its arms and legs rose, or rose high;<br>\
(K;) or it became inflated, or swollen, and its<br>\
arms and legs rose, or rose high. (Ks, S.) ―<br>\

so that its legs are raised; and of a wine-skin,<br>\
