شَعَبَ, (S, Msb,) aor.<br>\
شَعَبَ, (Msb,) inf. n. شَعْبٌ,<br>\
(A, Msb, K,) He collected; brought, gathered, or<br>\
drew, together; or united; (S, A, Msb, K;) a<br>\
thing, (S,) any thing or things, and a people or<br>\
party: (Msb:) and he separated; put apart, or<br>\
asunder; divided; disunited; or dispersed or<br>\
scattered; (S, A, Msb, K;) a thing, (S,) any<br>\
thing or things, and a people or party: (Msb:)<br>\
thus having two contr. significations: (S:) so<br>\
expressly state A&#39;Obeyd and Aboo-Ziyád: (TA:)<br>\
but accord. to IDrd, it has not two contr. significations [in one and the same dial.]: he says that<br>\
the two meanings are peculiar to the dials. of two<br>\
peoples, (Msb, TA, *) each meaning belonging to<br>\
the dial. of one people exclusively. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence, as it seems to be indicated in the S and<br>\
A, or from شَعْبٌ meaning “ a tribe,” as it seems<br>\
to be indicated in the Ham p. 538,] one says,<br>\
تَفَرَّقَ شَعْبُهُمْ, (S,) or شَتَّ شَعْبُهُمْ, (A, Ham,)<br>\
(tropical:)  [Their union became dissolved, or broken up; or<br>\
their tribe became separated;] meaning they<br>\
became separated after being congregated: (S,<br>\
Ham:) and اِلْتَأَمَ شَعْبُهُمْ (S, A, Ham) (tropical:)  [Their<br>\
separation became closed up, or their tribe drew<br>\
together;] meaning they drew together after being<br>\
separated. (S, Ham.) And شَعَبَتْهُمُ المَنِيَّةُ Death<br>\
separated them: (S:) and شَعَبَتْهُ شَعُوبُ [Death<br>\
separated him from his companions]; (TA;)<br>\
said of a man when he has died. (O in art. عبل:<br>\
in the K, in that art., ↓ اِشْتَعَبَتْهُ [perhaps a mistranscription].) And it is said in a trad., مَا هٰذِهِ<br>\
الفُتْيَا الَّتِى شَعَبْتَ بِهَا النَّاسَ i. e, [What is this<br>\
judicial decision] with which thou hast divided<br>\
the people? (S. [In the TA, on the authority of<br>\
IAth, التى شَغَبَتْ فِى النَّاسِ, which means,<br>\
“ which has excited evil among the people. ”])<br>\
One says also, شَعَبَ الرَّجُلُ أَمْرَهُ (assumed tropical:)  The man broke<br>\
up, discomposed, deranged, or disorganized, [or<br>\
rendered unsound, impaired, or marred, (agreeably with another explanation of the verb in what<br>\
follows,)] his state of affairs: (As, A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
TA:) whence the saying of &#39;Alee Ibn-El-&#39;Adheer<br>\
El-Ghanawee,<br>\
وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ المَرْءَ يَشْعَبُ أَمْرَهُ<br>\
شَعْبَ العَصَا وَيَلَجُّ فِى العِصْيَانِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [And when thou seest the man break up his<br>\
state of affairs as with the breaking up of the<br>\
staff, and persevere in disobedience, or rebellion].<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, aor, as above, (Msb,)<br>\
and so the inf. n., (S, A, Msb, K,) He repaired<br>\
a cracked thing [such as a wooden bowl or some<br>\
other vessel, by closing up its crack or cracks, or<br>\
by piecing it: see 2, which has a similar signification, but implying muchness]: (S, Msb:) and<br>\
[in a general sense,] he repaired, mended,<br>\
amended, adjusted, or put into a right, or proper,<br>\
state: (A, K, TA:) and it signifies the contr.<br>\
also [of the former meaning and] of this, in the<br>\
same, or in another, dial.: (TA:) [i. e.] he cracked<br>\
a thing [such as a wooden bowl &amp;c.]: (A, Msb:)<br>\
and he corrupted, rendered unsound, impaired, or<br>\
marred. (A, K, TA.) شَعْبٌ صَغِيرٌ مِنْ شَعْبٍ كَبِيرٍ,<br>\
occurring in a trad. of &#39;Omar, means A little<br>\
repairing, of, or amid, much impairing. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [He gave a portion of property; as though he<br>\
broke it off.] One says, اِشْعَبْ لِى شُعْبَةً مِنَ المَالِ<br>\
Give thou to me a portion of the property. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  He (the commander, or prince, S) sent a messenger (S, K) إِلَيْهِ [to him], (K,) or إِلَى مَوْضِعِ كَذَا<br>\
[to such a place]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b5-  He turned, or sent,<br>\
him, or it, away, or back: (K, TA:) aor. and<br>\
inf.n. as above. (TA.) And شَعَبَ اللِّجَامُ الفَرَسَ<br>\
The bridle turned away or back, or withheld, or<br>\
restrained, the horse from the direction towards<br>\
which he was going. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  He, or it, diverted<br>\
a man by occupying him, busying him, or engaging his attention. (K, TA.) One says, مَا<br>\
شَعَبَكَ عَنِّى [What diverted thee, or what has<br>\
diverted thee, &amp;c., from me?]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  It is<br>\
also intrans.: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Thus it signifies He<br>\
quitted his companions, desiring others.] One<br>\
says, شَعَبَ إِلَيْهِمْ (K, TA) فِى عَدَدِ كَذَا (TA) He<br>\
yearned towards them [with such a number of<br>\
men], and quitted his companions. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And He, or it, appeared [distinct from others]:<br>\
(K, TA:) whence the month [شَعْبَان, q. v.,] is<br>\
[said to be] named. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, (K, TA,)<br>\
aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,) said of a camel,<br>\
He cropped (اِهْتَضَمَ) the upper, or uppermost,<br>\
parts of trees [or shrubs]. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  شَعِبَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
شَعَبَ, (K,) inf. n. شَعَبٌ, (S, * K, * TA,) He (a<br>\
goat, S, TA, and a gazelle, TA) was wide, (K,)<br>\
or very wide, (S,) between the horns, (S, K,) and<br>\
between the shoulders. (K, * TA.) [See also<br>\
شَعَبٌ, below.]<br>\
2<br>\
شعّب [app. signifies He collected several<br>\
things; or he collected much: and] he separated<br>\
several things; or he separated much. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also He repaired a cracked wooden bowl [or<br>\
some other vessel] in several places [by closing up<br>\
its cracks, or by piecing it]: (S, O:) [and app.,<br>\
in a general sense, he repaired, mended, amended,<br>\
adjusted, or put into a right, or proper, state,<br>\
several things; or he repaired, &amp;c., much: and it<br>\
seems to signify also the contr. of these two<br>\
meanings: i. e. he cracked several things; or he<br>\
cracked in several places: and he corrupted,<br>\
rendered unsound, impaired, or marred, several<br>\
things; or he corrupted, &amp;c., much.]<br>\
-A2-  It is also<br>\
intrans.: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  Thus, said of seed-produce, It<br>\
branched forth, or forked, after being in leaf, or<br>\
blade; (TA;) like ↓ تشعّب. (K, * TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
one says, إِنِّى أَرَى الشَّرَّ شَعَّبَ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily I see<br>\
the evil to have grown like seed-produce when it<br>\
branches forth]; like as one says, قَصَّبَ, and نَبَّبَ.<br>\
(TA in art. نب.)<br>\
3<br>\
شاعبهُ He became distant, or remote, from<br>\
him; (K, TA;) namely, his companion. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence,] شاعب الحَيَاةَ (assumed tropical:)  [He quitted life]. (TA.)<br>\
And شَاعَبَتْ نَفْسُهُ (K, TA) His soul [departed,<br>\
or] quitted life; (TA;) meaning he died; (K,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ انشعب [i. e. انشعب هُوَ]. (K.)<br>\
[See also what next follows.]<br>\
4<br>\
اشعب He died: (S, K: [see also 3:]) or (so<br>\
in the S and TA, but in the K “ and ”) he separated himself from another or others, never to<br>\
return; (S, K;) as also ↓ شعّب or ↓ شَعَبَ, accord.<br>\
to different copies of the K, the latter as in the L.<br>\
(TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely, En-Nábighah<br>\
El-Jaadee, (IB, TA.)<br>\
وَكَانُوا أُنَاسًا مِنْ شُعُوبٍ فَأَشْعَبُوا<br>\
(S, IB, TA,) or وَكَانُوا شُعُوبًا مِنْ أُنَاسٍ, accord.<br>\
to different readings: [app. meaning, And they<br>\
were men of divided races or tribes, or were<br>\
divided races or tribes of men; so they perished;<br>\
or separated, never to return:] IB says, after<br>\
mentioning the former reading, i. e. they were of<br>\
men who should perish; so they perished: having<br>\
previously mentioned the latter reading, and<br>\
added, i. e. they were of those whom شعوب<br>\
should overtake. (TA. [IB&#39;s explanations seem<br>\
at first sight to indicate that he read شَعُوبَ and<br>\
شَعُوبًا; neither of which is admissible: each of<br>\
his explanations app. relates to both readings; as<br>\
though he understood the poet to mean, they<br>\
were men separated from different tribes, to be<br>\
overtaken by others; so they perished.])<br>\
5<br>\
تشعّب and ↓ انشعب are quasi-pass. verbs,<br>\
the former of شَعَّبَ and the latter of شَعَبَ: (TA:)<br>\
[the former, therefore, is most correctly to be<br>\
regarded and used as intensive in its significations,<br>\
or as relating to several things or persons: but it<br>\
is said that] both signify alike: [app. It became<br>\
collected; it became brought, gathered, or drawn,<br>\
together; or it became united: and also] it became<br>\
separated, put apart or asunder, divided, disunited, or dispersed or scattered: (S, K:) and<br>\
it, or he, became distant, or remote. (K.) One<br>\
says, تَشَعَّبُوا فِى طَلَبِ المِيَاهِ [They became separated, &amp;c., or they separated themselves, &amp;c., in<br>\
search of the waters], and فِى الغَارَاتِ [in predatory excursions]. (TA.) And عَنِّى ↓ انشعب<br>\
فُلَانٌ Such a one became distant, or remote, from<br>\
me; or withdrew to a distance, or for away, from<br>\
me. (TA.) And الطَّرِيقُ ↓ انشعب [and تشعّب]<br>\
The road separated. (S, A, Msb.) And ↓ انشعب<br>\
النَّهْرُ and تشعّب The river separated [or branched<br>\
forth] into other rivers. (TA.) And ↓ انشعبت<br>\
أَغْصَانُ الشَّجَرَةِ (S, Msb, TA) and تشعّبت (TA)<br>\
The branches of the tree separated, divided,<br>\
straggled, or spread out dispersedly; (S, TA;) or<br>\
branched forth from the stem, and separated,<br>\
divided, &amp;c. (Msb.) See also 2. One says also,<br>\
تشعّب أَمْرُ الرَّجُلِ (assumed tropical:)  [The state of affairs of the<br>\
man became broken up, discomposed, deranged,<br>\
disorganized, or (agreeably with another explanation of the verb in what follows) rendered unsound, impaired, or marred]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also ↓ the<br>\
latter verb, [or each,] It became closed up; [or<br>\
repaired by having a crack or cracks closed up,<br>\
or by being pieced;] said of a cracked thing:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ both verbs, i. q. اِنْصَلَحَ [which<br>\
means, in a general sense, it became rectified,<br>\
repaired, mended, amended, adjusted, or put into<br>\
a right, or proper, state; &amp;c.; but I have not<br>\
found this verb (انصلح) in its proper art. in any<br>\
of the Lexicons]: (K, TA:) and ↓ the latter signifies also it became cracked; (A;) [and in like<br>\
manner the former, said of a number of things;<br>\
or it became cracked in several places when said<br>\
of a single thing: and hence ↓ both signify, in a<br>\
general sense, it became corrupted, rendered unsound, impaired, or marred; a meaning which<br>\
may justly be assigned to the former verb in the<br>\
phrase mentioned in the next preceding sentence.]<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْشَعَبَ see 5, in nine places: and see also 3.<br>\
8<br>\
إِشْتَعَبَ see 1, in the former half of the paragraph.<br>\
شَعْبٌ inf. n. of شَعَبَ [q. v.]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Used<br>\
as a simple subst., it signifies Collection, or<br>\
union: and also separation, division, or disunion;<br>\
and] a state of separation or division or disunion;<br>\
(K, TA;) as also ↓ شُعْبَةٌ: (S, TA:) pl. of the<br>\
former شُعُوبٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence, perhaps,<br>\
as implying both union and division,] Such as is<br>\
divided [into sub-tribes], of the tribes of the<br>\
Arabs and foreigners: (S: [in my copy of the<br>\
Msb, ما انقسمت فيه قبائل العرب, as though<br>\
it meant the tribes of the Arabs collectively,<br>\
agreeably with another explanation to be mentioned below; but I think that there may be a<br>\
mistranscription in this case:]) pl. شُعُوبٌ: (S,<br>\
Msb:) or it signifies, as some say, (Msb,) or<br>\
signifies also, (S,) a great tribe; syn. قَبِيلَةٌ عَظِيمَةٌ,<br>\
(S, A, K,) or حَىٌّ عَظِيمٌ; (Msb;) the parent of<br>\
the [tribes called] قَبَائِل, to which they refer their<br>\
origin, and which comprises them: (S:) or, as<br>\
some say, a great tribe (حَىٌّ عَظِيمٌ) forming a<br>\
branch of a قَبِيلَة: or a قَبِيلَة itself: (TA:)<br>\
A&#39; Obeyd says, on the authority of Ibn-El-Kelbee,<br>\
on the authority of his father, that the شَعْب is<br>\
greater than the قَبِيلَة; next to which is the فَصِيلَة;<br>\
then, the عَمَارَة; then, the بَطْن; then, the فَخِذ:<br>\
(S, TA:) but IB says that the true order is that<br>\
which Ez-Zubeyr Ibn-Bekkár has stated, and is<br>\
as follows: (TA:) [i. e.] the genealogies of the<br>\
Arabs consist of six degrees; (Msb;) first, the<br>\
شَعْب; then, the قَبِيلَة; then, the عَمَارَة, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) with fet-h and with kesr, to the ع; (Msb;)<br>\
then, the بَطْن; then, the فَخِذ; and then, the<br>\
فَصيلَة: thus, Khuzeymeh is a شعب; and Kináneh,<br>\
a قبيلَة; and Kureysh, an عمارة; and Kuseí, a<br>\
بطن; and Háshim, a فخذ; and El-&#39;Abbás, a<br>\
فصيلة: (Msb, TA:) and Aboo-Usámeh says that<br>\
these classes are agreeable with the order obtaining in the structure of man; the شعب is the<br>\
greatest of them, derived from the شَعْب [or<br>\
suture] of the head; next is the قبيلة, from the<br>\
قبيلة [which is a term applied to any one of the<br>\
four principal bones] of the head; then, the عمارة,<br>\
which is the breast; then, the بطن [or belly];<br>\
then, the فخذ [or thigh]; and then, the فصيلة,<br>\
which is the shank: to these some add the عَشِتيرَة,<br>\
which consists of few in comparison with what<br>\
are before mentioned: (TA:) and some add after<br>\
this the رَهْط: some also add the جِذْم before the<br>\
شعب: (TA in art. بطن:) the pl. is as above.<br>\
(TA.) It signifies also A nation, people, race, or<br>\
family of mankind; syn. جِيلٌ; as expl. by IM<br>\
and others: in the K, [and in a copy of the A,]<br>\
erroneously, جَبَل [a mountain]: (TA:) but it is<br>\
[strangely] said by Aboo-&#39;Obeyd El-Bekree that<br>\
accord. to all except Bundár, the word in this<br>\
sense is ↓ شِعْبٌ, with kesr. (MF.) And the pl.,<br>\
شُعُوبٌ, is [said to be] especially applied to denote<br>\
the foreigners (العَجَم): (TA:) [thus it is said<br>\
that] the phrase, in a trad., إِنَّ رَجُلًا مِنَ الشُّعُوبِ<br>\
أَسْلَمَ means [Verily a man] of the foreigners<br>\
(العَجَم) [became a Muslim: but see الشُّعُوبِيَّةُ].<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, [as implying separation,] Distance,<br>\
or remoteness. (A, K.) So in the phrase شَعْبُ<br>\
الدَّارِ [The distance, or remoteness, of the abode, or<br>\
dwelling]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And A crack (S, A, K,<br>\
TA) in a thing, (S,) which the شَعَّاب repairs.<br>\
(S, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And The place of junction [i. e. the<br>\
suture] of the قَبَائِل [or principal bones] of the<br>\
head; (K;) the شَأْن which conjoins the قبائل of<br>\
the head: the قبائل in the head being [the frontal<br>\
bone, the occipital bone, and the two parietal<br>\
bones; in all,] four in number. (S.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence,<br>\
perhaps,] هُمَا شَعْبَانِ (assumed tropical:)  They two are likes [or like<br>\
each other]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b8-  See also شِعْبٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
Distant, or remote; (K;) as in the phrase مَآءٌ<br>\
شَعْبٌ [Distant, or remote, water]: pl. شُعُوبٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
شُعْبٌ: see the dual شُعْبَانِ voce شُعْبَةٌ.<br>\
شِعْبٌ A road: (Msb:) or a road in a mountain:<br>\
(S, A, O, L, Msb, K:) primarily a road in a<br>\
mountain (Har p. 29) and in valleys: (Id. p. 72:)<br>\
afterwards applied to any road: (Id. p. 29:) [see<br>\
also مَشْعَبٌ:] pl. شِعَابٌ. (S, O, Msb.) And A<br>\
water-course, or place in which water flows, in [a<br>\
low, or depressed, tract, such as is called] a بَطْن<br>\
of land, (ISh, A, O, K,) having two elevated<br>\
borders, and in width equal to the stature of a<br>\
man lying down, and sometimes between the two<br>\
faces, or acclivities, of two mountains. (ISh, O.)<br>\
Or it signifies, (K,) or signifies also, (A,) A<br>\
ravine, or gap, [or pass,] between two mountains.<br>\
(A, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also [A reef of rocks in the sea: so<br>\
in the present day: or] a زِرْبَة or زَرَبَة (accord. to<br>\
different copies of the K in art. جهن [but neither<br>\
of these two words do I find in their proper art.<br>\
in any Lex.]) in the sea, such as is connected with<br>\
the shore: if not connected with the shore, a bowshot distant, it is called جُهْنٌ. (K and TA in art.<br>\
جهن.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A brand, or mark made with a<br>\
hot iron, (S, K,) upon camels, (K,) peculiar to<br>\
the Benoo-Minkar, in form resembling the<br>\
[hooked stick called] مِحْجَن: (S:) or a brand<br>\
upon the thigh, lengthwise, [consisting of] two<br>\
lines meeting at the top and separated at the<br>\
bottom: (ISh, TA:) or a brand united [at the<br>\
upper part and] at the lower part separated:<br>\
(Aboo-&#39; Alee in the “ Tedhkireh,” TA: [but there<br>\
is an omission here, so that the reverse may<br>\
perhaps be meant:]) or a brand upon the neck,<br>\
like the مِحْجَن: (Suh in the R, TA:) in a marginal note in the copy of the L, it is said that<br>\
شعب signifying a brand is with kesr to the ش<br>\
and with fet-h [i. e. شِعْبٌ and ↓ شَعْبٌ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
See also شَعْبٌ. ―<br>\
-b5-  [And see the pl. شِعَابٌ below.]<br>\
شَعَبٌ Width, or distance, (A, K,) or great<br>\
width or distance, (S,) between the horns (S, A,<br>\
K) of a goat (S, TA) and of a gazelle, (TA,) and<br>\
between the shoulders, (A, K,) and between two<br>\
branches. (A.) [See also 1, last signification.]<br>\
شُعْبَةٌ: see شَعْبٌ, second sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The<br>\
space, or interstice, between two horns: and<br>\
between two branches: (K:) pl. شُعَبٌ and شِعَابٌ,<br>\
(K, * TA,) in this and all the following senses.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A cleft in a mountain, to which<br>\
birds (الطَّيْرُ, for which المَطَرُ is erroneously substituted in [several of] the copies of the K, TA)<br>\
resort: pl. as above. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A branch<br>\
of a tree, (S, A, * Mgh, * Msb, TA,) growing out<br>\
a part, or divaricating, therefrom: (Msb, * TA:)<br>\
or the extremity of a branch: (K, TA: [said in<br>\
the latter to be tropical in this latter sense; but<br>\
why, I see not:]) pl. شُعَبٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, TA)<br>\
and شِعَابٌ, as above. (TA.) And شُعَبُ الغُصْنِ<br>\
The divaricating, or straggling, [branchlets, or]<br>\
extremities [or shoots or stalks] of the branch.<br>\
(TA.) And [hence] عَصًا فِى رَأْسِهَا شُعْبَتَانِ [A<br>\
staff having at his head two forking portions or<br>\
projections]; (A, TA;) and Az mentions, as<br>\
heard by him from the Arabs, ↓ شُعْبَانِ, without<br>\
ت, instead of شُعْبَتَانِ in this phrase. (L, TA.)<br>\
And شُعْبَةٌ مِنْ رَيْحَانٍ [A sprig, spray, bunch, or<br>\
branchlet, of sweet basil, or of sweet-smelling<br>\

him; (S, and so in some copies of the K;) as the<br>\
neck, and the مِنْسَج [or withers, &amp;c.], (S, TA,)<br>\
and the crests of the hips, (TA,) or such as his<br>\
head, and his حَارِك [or withers, &amp;c.], and the<br>\
crests of his hips. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also A small water-course, or channel in which water flows; as in<br>\
the phrase شُعْبَةٌ حَافِلٌ a small water-course filled<br>\
with a torrent: (S:) or a water-course in sand;<br>\
(K;) or in the elevated part of a depressed tract<br>\
into which sand has poured and remained. (TA.)<br>\
And A small portion of a [water-course such as<br>\
is called] تَلْعَة; or what is smaller than a تَلْعَة;<br>\
accord. to different copies of the K; الشُّعْبَةُ being<br>\
expl. as meaning مَا صَغُرَ مِنَ التَّلْعَةِ, and, in one<br>\
copy, عَنِ التَّلْعَةِ. (TA.) And Such as is large,<br>\
of the channels for irrigation of valleys: (K,<br>\
TA:) or, as some say, a branch from a تَلْعَة, and<br>\
from a valley, or torrent-bed, taking a different<br>\
course therefrom: pl. as above. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And<br>\
A portion, part, or piece, of a thing; or somewhat thereof: (S, Msb, K, TA:) pl. as above.<br>\
(TA.) One says, اِشْعَبْ لِى شُعْبَةً مِنَ المَالِ Give<br>\
thou to me a portion of the property. (TA.)<br>\
And فِى يَدِهِ شُعْبَةُ خَيْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  [In his hand is somewhat<br>\
of good, or of wealth]. (TA.) And it is said in<br>\
a trad., الحَيَآءُ شُعْبَةٌ مِنَ الإِيمَانِ (assumed tropical:)  Modesty is a<br>\
part of faith: and in another, الشَّبَابُ شُعْبَةٌ مِنَ<br>\
الجُنُونِ (assumed tropical:)  [Youth is a part of insanity]. (TA.)<br>\
In explanation of the phrase, in the Kur [lxxvii.<br>\
30], إِلَى ظِلٍّ ذِى ثَلَاثِ شُعَبٍ [Unto a shade, or<br>\
shadow, having three parts, or divisions], it is<br>\
said that the fire [of Hell], on the day of resurrection, will divide into three parts; and whenever<br>\
they shall attempt to go forth to a place, it will<br>\
repel them: by ظِلّ being here meant that the<br>\
fire will form a covering; for [literally] there<br>\
will be no ظِلّ in this case. (Th, L.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And A<br>\
piece such as is called رُؤبَة, with which a wooden<br>\
bowl [or the like] is repaired. (S.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Accord. to<br>\
Lth, (T, TA,) شُعَبُ الدَّهْرِ means (tropical:)  The changes,<br>\
or vicissitudes, of time or fortune; (T, A, TA;)<br>\
and he cites the saying of Dhu-r-Rummeh,<br>\
وَلَا تُقَسِّمُ شَعْبًا وَاحِدًا شُعَبُ<br>\
which he explains by saying, i. e. I thought that<br>\
one thing, or state of things, would not be divided<br>\
into many things, or states: [i. e. Nor did I think<br>\
that the vicissitudes of fortune would divide one<br>\
whole body of men into many parties:] but Az<br>\
disapproves of this explanation, and says that<br>\
شُعَب here means Intentions, designs, or purposes:<br>\
he says that the poet describes tribes assembled<br>\
together in the [season called] رَبِيع, who, when<br>\
they desired to return to the watering-places,<br>\
differed in their intentions, or designs; wherefore<br>\
he says, Nor did I think that various intentions<br>\
would divide [one whole body of men who before<br>\
had] a consentient intention. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  [See<br>\
also the pl. شِعَابٌ below.]<br>\
شَعْبَانُ, imperfectly decl., (Msb,) The name of<br>\
a month [i. e. the eighth month of the Arabian<br>\
year]: pl. شَعْبَانَاتٌ (S, Msb, K) and شَعَابِينُ:<br>\
(Msb, K:) so called from تَشَعَّبَ “ it became<br>\
separated; ” (K, TA;) because therein they used<br>\
to separate, or disperse themselves, in search of<br>\
water [when the months were regulated by the<br>\
solar year; this month then corresponding partly<br>\
to June and partly to July, as shown voce زَمَنٌ,<br>\
q. v.]; or, as some say, for predatory expeditions<br>\
[after having been restrained therefrom during<br>\
the sacred month of Rejeb]; or, accord. to some,<br>\
as Th says, from شَعَبَ “ it appeared; ” because of<br>\
its appearance between the months of Rejeb and<br>\
Ramadán. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  غَزَالُ شَعْبَانَ A certain insect, (K, * TA,) a species of the جُنْدَب, or of the<br>\
جُخْدُب. (TA.)<br>\
شِعَابٌ pl. of شِعْبٌ: (S, O, Msb:) and of شُعْبَةٌ.<br>\
(K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شَغَلَتْ شِعَابِى جَدْوَاىَ is a prov.,<br>\
[expl. as] meaning The abundance of the food<br>\
[that I have to procure for my family] has occupied me so as to divert me from giving to people:<br>\
(S, TA:) [Z considers شعاب, here, as pl. of شُعْبَةٌ<br>\
“ a branch,” and as meaning duties, and relations:<br>\
(Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov., i. 653:)] but El-Mundhiree says that شِعَابِى is a mistranscription: the<br>\
other reading is سَعَاتِى, meaning “ my expending<br>\
upon my family. ” (Meyd. [See also سَعَاةٌ, in<br>\
art. سعو and سعى.])<br>\
شَعُوبُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) without the article ال,<br>\
and imperfectly decl., (Msb,) and الشَّعُوبُ, (A,<br>\
Msb, K,) with the article, and perfectly decl.,<br>\
(Msb,) but several authors disallow this latter,<br>\
accounting it wrong; (TA;) a name for Death;<br>\
(S, A, * Msb, K; *) so called because it separates<br>\
men: (S, Msb:) the former is a proper name:<br>\
(Msb:) J says [in the S] that it is determinate,<br>\
and does not admit the article ال: in the L, it is<br>\
said that شَعُوبُ and الشَّعُوبُ both signify as above;<br>\
and that in either case it may be originally an<br>\
epithet, being like the epithets قَتُول and ضَرُوب;<br>\
and if so, the article in this case is as in العَبَّاسُ<br>\
and الحَسَنُ and الحٰرِثُ: and this opinion is confirmed by what is said of its derivation: but he<br>\
who says شَعُوب, without the article, makes the<br>\
word a pure substantive, and deprives it literally<br>\
of the character of an epithet; wherefore the<br>\
article is not necessarily attached to it, as it is not<br>\
to عَبَّاس and حٰرِث; yet the essence of an epithet<br>\
is in it still, as in the instance of جَابِرُ بْنُ حَبَّةَ, a<br>\
name for “ bread,” so called because it reinvigorates the hungry; and as in وَاسِط, [a certain<br>\
town] so called, accord. to Sb, because midway<br>\
between El-&#39;Irák [&#39; Irák el-&#39;Ajam] and El-Basrah:<br>\
thus in the L. (TA.) One says of a person when<br>\
he has been at the point of death and then escaped,<br>\
أَقَصَّتْهُ شَعُوبُ [Death became near to him]. (TA.)<br>\
And it is said in a trad., فَمَا زِلْتُ وَاضِعًا رِجْلِى<br>\
عَلَى خَدِّهِ حَتَّى أَزَرْتُهُ شَعُوبَ, i. e. [And I ceased<br>\
not putting my foot upon his cheek until] I made<br>\
death to visit him. (TA.)<br>\
شَعِيبٌ A [leathern water-bag such as is called]<br>\
مَزَادَة [q. v.]; (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K;) as also رَاوِيَةٌ and<br>\
سَطِيحَةٌ: (A&#39;Obeyd, S:) or one that has been<br>\
repaired, or pieced: (TA:) or one that is made<br>\
of two hides: (K:) or one that is made of two<br>\
hides facing each other, without فِئَام at their<br>\
corners; فئام in [the making of] مَزَايِد being the<br>\
taking of the hide and folding it, and then adding<br>\
at the sides what will widen it: or one that is<br>\
pieced (تُفْأَمُ) with a third skin, between the two<br>\
skins, that it may be rendered wider: or one that<br>\
is made of two pieces joined together: (TA:) or<br>\
one that is sewed (مَخْرُوزَة, K and TA, in the<br>\
CK مَحْزُوزَة,) on both sides: (K:) called thus<br>\
because one part is joined to another: (L, TA:)<br>\
pl. شُعُبٌ. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also An old, worn-out<br>\
skin for water or milk: (K:) because it is pieced,<br>\
or repaired: (TA:) pl. as above. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
A camel&#39;s saddle; syn. رَحْلٌ: because it is joined,<br>\
part to part: so in the saying of El-Marrár,<br>\
describing a she-camel,<br>\
إِذَا هِىَ خَرَّتْ خَرَّ مِنْ عَنْ يَمِينِهَا<br>\
شَعِيبٌ بِهِ إِحْمَامُهَا وَلُغُوبُهَا<br>\
[When she falls down, or fell down, there falls<br>\
down, or fell down, from her right side a saddle<br>\
by reason of which was her fevered and jaded<br>\
state]. (TA.) ―<br>\

(IM, Msb, TA,) شُعُوبٌ being predominantly applied to the &#39;Ajam; (IM, TA;) like أَنْصَارِىٌّ<br>\
[from الأَنْصَارُ]. (IM, Msb, * TA.) In the phrase<br>\
إِنَّ رَجُلًا مِنَ الشُّعُوبِ أَسْلَمَ, occurring in a trad.,<br>\
[and mentioned before, voce شَعْبٌ,] الشعوب may<br>\
mean العَجَم; or it may be [used as] a pl. of<br>\
الشُّعُوبِىُّ, like as اليَهُودُ and المَجُوسُ are [used as]<br>\
pls. of اليَهُودِىُّ and المَجُوسِىُّ. (IAth, TA.)<br>\
