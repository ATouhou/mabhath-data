place, or predicament, of the [other] thing, by<br>\
reason of an attribute connecting them [or common<br>\
to them]; which attribute may be real and ideal;<br>\
real as when one says, “this dirhem is like this<br>\
dirhem,” and “ this blackness is like this blackness; ” and ideal as when one says, “Zeyd is<br>\
like the lion ” or “ like the ass ” i. e. in his strength<br>\
or his stupidity, and “ Zeyd is like &#39;Amr ” i. e. in<br>\
his power and his generosity and similar qualities;<br>\
and sometimes it is tropical, as when one says,<br>\
“ the absent is like the non-existent,” and “ the<br>\
garment is like the dirhem ” i. e. the value of<br>\
the garment is equivalent to the dirhem. (Msb.)<br>\
شَبَّهُ, [app. for شبّه شَيْئًا بِشَىْء ٍ,] accord. to IAar,<br>\

-b2-  [Hence,] شبّههُ عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. as<br>\
above, He rendered it confused to him [by making<br>\
it to appear like some other thing]; (JK, * TA;)<br>\
he rendered it ambiguous, dubious, or obscure, to<br>\

أبَهُ فَمَا ظَلَمَ, as some relate it, (TA,) [Whoso resembles his father, he has not done that which is<br>\
wrong:] a prov., meaning, he has not put the<br>\
likeness in the wrong place; for there is not any<br>\
one more fit, or proper, for him to resemble than<br>\
he: or it may mean that the father has not done<br>\
that which is wrong. (Meyd. [See also Har<br>\
pp. 667-8.]) And اشبه الرَّجُلُ أُمَّهُ, (IAar, K,)<br>\

إِنَّ اللَّبَنَ يُشْبَهُ عَلَيْهِ [Verily one becomes like by<br>\
feeding upon milk]: i. e. the infant that is suckled<br>\

him, or it; (MA, KL; *) i. q. تمثّل: (S, * TA:<br>\
[in the former, this meaning is indicated, but not<br>\
expressed:]) said of a man. (S.) See also 4, last<br>\

rendered confused, or dubious, to him: (K, * TA:)<br>\

the only other instances of the kind, i. e. of words<br>\

بِالتَّمْرَةِ [More like than the date to the date] is a<br>\

↓ مُشَبِّهَاتٌ, [thus agreeably with an explanation of<br>\

resembling one another so that they become confounded, or confused, or dubious, and not resembling one another &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
مُتَشَابِهٌ Consimilar, or conformable, in its several<br>\
parts: thus مُتَشَابِهًا means in the Kur xxxix. 24.<br>\
(Jel.) And مُتَشَابِهَاتٌ Things like, or resembling,<br>\
one another. (JK, S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also مُشْتَبِهٌ. ―<br>\

مُتَشَابِهَاتٌ in the Kur iii. 5 means Verses that are<br>\
equivocal, or ambiguous; i. e. susceptible of different interpretations: (Ksh:) or verses unintelligible; such as the commencements [of many] of<br>\
the chapters: (Jel:) or the مُتَشَابِه in the Kur is<br>\
that of which the meaning is not to be learned<br>\
from its words; and this is of two sorts; one is<br>\
that of which the meaning is known by referring<br>\
it to what is termed مُحْكَم [q. v.]; and the other<br>\
is that of which the knowledge of its real meaning<br>\
is not attainable in any way: (TA:) or it means<br>\
what is not understood without repeated con-<br>\
sideration: (TA in art. فسر:) Ed-Dahhák is related to have explained المُحْكَمَاتُ as meaning<br>\
“ what have not been abrogated; ” and المُتَشَابِهَاتُ<br>\
as meaning what have been abrogated. (TA in<br>\
the present art.)<br>\
