شَطَبَ, (K, TA,) aor.<br>\
شَطُبَ, (TA,) inf. n. شَطْبٌ,<br>\
(AZ, TA,) He cut (K, TA) into oblong pieces, or<br>\
strips, flesh-meat, and a camel&#39;s hump, and a<br>\
hide, or leather: (TA:) or he cut into strips, but<br>\
without separating them, a camel&#39;s hump. (AZ,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And شَطَبَتِ الجَرِيدَ, [aor.<br>\
شَطُبَ,] inf. n. شَطْبٌ,<br>\
She (a woman) split the palm-sticks, or palmbranches stripped of their leaves, to make of them<br>\
mats: which being done, says A&#39;Obeyd, [or<br>\
when they have been peeled,] the شَاطِبَة [q.v.]<br>\
throws them to the مُنَقِّيَة. (S.) [Or] شَطَبَت,<br>\
aor.<br>\
شَطُبَ, inf. n. شُطُوبٌ, She removed the upper peel<br>\
of the شَطْب, or [fresh, green] palm-branches.<br>\
(ISk, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شَطَبَ also signifies It inclined, or<br>\
declined, turned aside or away, deflected, or<br>\
deviated, and became distant, or remote; (As, O,<br>\
K;) and so شَطَفَ; and both signify it went<br>\
away. (As, TA.) One says, شَطَبَ عَنْهُ It turned<br>\
aside or away, and became distant, or remote,<br>\
from him, or it. (K.) Thus, in a trad., شَطَبَ<br>\
الرُّمْحُ عَنْ مَقْتَلِهِ The spear deflected from, and<br>\
failed to reach, his vital part. (O, TA. *) And<br>\
one says also, شَطَبَتِ الدَّارُ The dwelling was, or<br>\
became, distant, or remote. (O.)<br>\
7<br>\
انشطب It flowed; (S, K;) said of water,<br>\
&amp;c. (K.)<br>\
شَطْبٌ pl. of ↓ شَطْبَةٌ, (S, Msb,) [or rather a<br>\
coll. gen. n., of which the latter is the n. un.,] like<br>\
as تَمْرٌ is of تَمْرَةٌ; (Msb;) Fresh, (A,) or green,<br>\
(Msb,) or green and fresh, (S, K,) palm-branches<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K) stripped of their leaves: (A:) or<br>\
they are less than what are termed شَطَائِبُ, of<br>\
which the sing. is ↓ شَطِيبَةٌ; and the شطائب are<br>\
less than the كَرَانِيف: [i. e. the كِرْنَاف is the<br>\
thickest part of the palm-branch; next is the<br>\
شَطِيبَة; and next to this, the شَطْبَة:] or ↓ شَطْبَةٌ<br>\
signifies a green palm-branch. (K.) كَمَسَلِّ<br>\
↓ شَطْبَةٍ, in a trad. of Umm-Zara, [as expl. in art.<br>\
سل, q. v.,] means Like a green palm-stick drawn<br>\
forth from its skin: or like a sword drawn forth<br>\
[from its scabbard]: (TA in art. سل:) [for] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
↓ شَطْبَةٌ signifies also A sword. (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, app.,] شَطْبٌ is used also as an<br>\
epithet, meaning (tropical:)  Tall, and well made; (A, K,<br>\
TA;) applied to a man and to a horse. (TA.)<br>\
And, applied to a boy, or young man, (tropical:)  Plump;<br>\
or fat, soft, thin-skinned, and plump: and so<br>\
↓ شَطْبَةٌ applied to a girl, or young woman: (A:)<br>\
or the former, applied to a boy, or young man,<br>\
well made, and neither tall nor short: (TA:) or,<br>\
so applied, light, or active, in body, and sharpheaded: (IAar, TA in art. عضب, voce عَضْبٌ:)<br>\
or it means, so applied, long and even (سَبِطٌ) in<br>\
the bones, light of flesh; likened to the palm-stick<br>\
that is split: but this epithet is mostly used with<br>\
ة, i. e. ↓ شَطْبَةٌ, which is applied to a mare: (Ham<br>\
p. 298:) or this epithet, شَطْبَةٌ, applied to a mare,<br>\
means lank (سَبِطَةٌ) in flesh; (K, TA;) or tall;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ شِطْبَةٌ in the former sense, (K,<br>\
TA,) or in the latter; and the masc. is not thus<br>\
used, applied to a horse: (TA:) and ↓ شَطْبَةٌ, (S,)<br>\
or ↓ شِطْبَةٌ, (K,) or both, but the former is the<br>\
more approved, (TA,) beautiful; plump; or fat,<br>\
soft, thin-skinned, and plump; (K, TA;) and<br>\
tall: (K:) or simply tall; (S, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ مَشْطُوبٌ and ↓ مُشَطَّبٌ applied to a man. (TA.)<br>\
شَطْبَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
seven places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see what next follows.<br>\
شُطْبَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ شِطْبَةٌ (K) and ↓ شَطْبَةٌ (TA)<br>\
and ↓ شُطَبَةٌ, (K,) which last is said by some to be<br>\
a n. un. of شُطَبٌ [mentioned in what follows as a<br>\
pl.], (MF,) A [raised] line (طَرِيقَة, S, O, or<br>\
طَرِيق, K, [meaning a ridge, and sometimes also<br>\
a depressed line, as shown voce مُشَطَّبٌ, i. e. a<br>\
channel,]) in the مَتْن [i. e. broad side, or middle<br>\
of the broad side, of the blade] (S, O) of a sword:<br>\
(S, O, K:) pl. شُطَبٌ and شُطُبٌ, (S, O,) or شُطُوبٌ<br>\
and شُطَبٌ and شُطُبٌ: (K: [in which it is said<br>\
that the pl. is شُطُوبٌ and شُطَبٌ like غُرَفٌ and<br>\
كُتُبٌ: but I think that شُطُوبٌ is a mistranscription, and that the right reading is شُطَبٌ and<br>\
شُطُبٌ like غُرَفٌ and كُتُبٌ:]) hence it would seem<br>\
that شُطَبٌ and شُطُبٌ are pls. of one sing.; but<br>\
Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee expressly states that the<br>\
former is pl. of شُطْبَةٌ; and the latter, of ↓ شَطِيبَةٌ;<br>\
(MF;) of which شَطَائِبُ also is a pl.; (L in art.<br>\
عمد;) and which signifies [the same as شُطْبَةٌ,<br>\
i. e.] the rising عَمُود [i. e. the ridge] in the مَتْن<br>\
of a sword. (ISh, TA.) [See also مُشَطَّبٌ: and<br>\
see عَمُودٌ and مَيْنٌ.]<br>\

شَطِيبَةٌ A slice, or strip, of flesh-meat: (TA:)<br>\
or a piece cut lengthwise of a camel&#39;s hump; (S,<br>\
O, K, TA;) as also ↓ شِطْبَةٌ: (O, K:) or a piece<br>\
cut in the form of a strip, but not separated, of a<br>\
camel&#39;s hump; and so ↓ the latter word: pl. of the<br>\
former شَطَائِبُ. (AZ, TA.) ―<br>\

lengthwise of a hide or of leather; (S, O;) as also<br>\

palm-branches [stripped of their leaves]: (ISk,<br>\
TA:) the pl. occurs in a verse cited voce تَذَرَّعَ.<br>\

-A2-  Also, [from the intrans. verb شَطَبَ,]<br>\
طَرِيقٌ شَاطِبٌ A road inclining, declining, or<br>\
