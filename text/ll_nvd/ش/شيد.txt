شَادَهُ, aor. يَشِيدُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. شَيْدٌ,<br>\
(S,) He plastered it (a wall) with شِيد, (S, K,)<br>\
i. e. gypsum, or the like: (K:) he built it (a<br>\
structure) with شِيد, meaning gypsum. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2. ―<br>\
-b3-  شَادُوا الدِّينَ (assumed tropical:)  They strengthened<br>\
and exalted the religion: from شَادَ in the first of<br>\
the senses expl. above: (Har p. 5:) [or rather<br>\
from this verb as syn. with شَيَّدَ and أَشَادَ.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
See also 4. ―<br>\
-b5-  As inf. n. of شَادَ in the phrase<br>\
شَادَ بِالإِبِلِ, aor. as above, (TK,) شِيَادٌ signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The calling camels, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K, TA,)<br>\
as also ↓ إِشَادَةٌ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,) raising the voice<br>\
in doing so. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also, (K,) as inf. n. of<br>\
the same verb, (TK,) (assumed tropical:)  The rubbing perfume with<br>\
the skin; (K;) as also ↓ تَشَيُّدٌ; in some copies of<br>\
the K, ↓ تَشْيِيدٌ: (TA:) [the former of these two<br>\
seems to be the right; and the meaning seems to<br>\
be, the rubbing the skin with perfume; for,]<br>\
accord. to AA, one says بِهٰذَا الطِّيبِ ↓ تَشَيَّدْ,<br>\
meaning Rub thy skin with this perfume. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  شَادَ, (said of a man, TA,) aor. as above, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. شَيْدٌ, (TA,) also signifies He perished, or<br>\
died. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
شيّدهُ, (A, L, Msb, TA,) inf. n. تَشْيِيدٌ, (L,<br>\
Msb, TA,) He raised it high; (A, Msb, TA;)<br>\
namely, a palace, (A,) or a building; (Msb,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ اشادهُ, (A, L, TA,) and ↓ شَادَهُ:<br>\
(A: [this last is app. included with the two other<br>\
verbs, in the A, as having this meaning, which is<br>\
confirmed, as pertaining to it, by an explanation<br>\
of its pass. part. n., مَشِيدٌ, q. v.:]) or شيّدهُ [implies a repetition of the act of building: (see<br>\
مَشِيدٌ:) or] signifies he built it firmly, or strongly,<br>\
and raised it high. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1.<br>\
4<br>\
اشادهُ: see 2. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (L,) إِشَادَةٌ signifies<br>\
(tropical:)  The raising the voice in saying a thing (Lth, S,<br>\
L, K) [of any kind, or] such as one&#39;s companion<br>\
dislikes; like تَنْدِيدٌ. (Lth, L.) See also 1. You<br>\
say, اشاد صَوْتَهُ and بِصَوْتِهِ (tropical:)  He raised his voice.<br>\
(A.) And اشاد بِهِ (tropical:)  He proclaimed it, or cried<br>\
it, raising his voice; namely, a stray, or any other<br>\
thing: (As, L:) (tropical:)  he made it known; (AA, S, A,<br>\
K; *) namely, a stray. (S, K.) And اشاد بِذِكْرِهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  He raised his good fame, by praising him;<br>\
raised a good report of him: (S, * A, L:) and he<br>\
raised his ill fame, by dispraising him; raised an<br>\
evil report of him: and اشادهُ and ↓ شَادَهُ he raised<br>\
his notoriety or fame. (L.) And اشاد عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  He<br>\
published against him something disliked, disapproved, or odious: one says, اشاد عَلَيْهِ قَبِيحًا<br>\
and بِقَبِيحٍ (tropical:)  [He published against him something<br>\
bad, evil, abominable, or foul]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
إِشَادَةٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The act of destroying: (K,<br>\
TA:) from the same word as syn. with تَنْدِيدٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَشَيَّدَ see 1, in two places.<br>\
شَيْدٌ, a Pers. word, [or rather of Pers. origin,<br>\
from شَيْدَا,] Possessed; or mad, or insane: or<br>\
intoxicated. (TA.)<br>\
شِيدٌ Anything with which a wall is plastered,<br>\
(S, A, K,) consisting of gypsum and the like;<br>\
(A, K;) J says, of gypsum or بَلَاط; but this last<br>\
word is a mistake, [probably originated by an<br>\
early transcriber of the S,] for مِلَاط, i. e. mud, or<br>\
clay: (K:) or [peculiarly] gypsum. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Az says that some of the Arabs sometimes call<br>\
thus A حِصْن [i. e. fortress, fort, or fortified<br>\
place]. (TA.)<br>\
مَشِيدٌ Plastered with شِيد; and so, as some say,<br>\
↓ مُشَيَّدٌ: (T:) or built with gypsum: (Msb:) or<br>\
made with شيد, (S, A, K,) i. e. gypsum; and so,<br>\
some say, ↓ مُشَيَّدٌ: (A:) or the latter signifies<br>\
raised high, or made lofty; (A &#39;Obeyd, S, A, K;)<br>\
and so the former, applied to a place, (A,) or<br>\
building: (TA:) the former has this meaning in<br>\
the Kur xxii. 44: (Jel:) J says in the S, Ks<br>\
says, مَشِيدٌ is applied to a sing., from the saying<br>\
in the Kur, [ubi suprà,] وَقَصْرٍ مَشِيدٍ; and ↓ مُشَيَّدٌ,<br>\
to a pl., from the saying in the same, [iv. 80,]<br>\
فِى بُرُوجٍ مُشَيَّدَةٍ: but this is a mistake: what Ks<br>\
says is that مُشَيَّدَةٌ, with ة and teshdeed, is a pl.<br>\
[i. e. a lexicological, not a grammatical, pl.] of<br>\
مُشَيَّدٌ: (IB, K: *) or the saying of Ks [if as quoted<br>\
in the S] may be expl. accord. to the opinion of<br>\
those who hold that مَشِيدٌ and مُشَيَّدٌ both signify<br>\
plastered with شِيد, on the supposition that the<br>\
Arabs did not use مَشِيدَةٌ as applied to a pl., but<br>\
only to a sing.: (Az, L:) [for] Fr says that the<br>\
pass. part. n. of the unaugmented verb only is<br>\
used when applied to a sing. and not denoting<br>\
repetition, or muchness; but either this or the<br>\
pass. part. n. of the verb of the measure فَعَّلَ may<br>\
be used when applied to a sing. and denoting<br>\
repetition, or muchness, and when applied to a<br>\
pl.: thus you say كَبْشٌ مَذْبُوحٌ [“ a slaughtered<br>\
ram ”]; but not مُذَبَّحٌ; but you may say ثَوْبٌ<br>\
مُخَرَّقٌ [as meaning “ a garment in which holes<br>\
have been repeatedly made,” or “ in which many<br>\
holes have been made,” or “ much pierced with<br>\
holes,” as well as ثَوْبٌ مَخْرُوقٌ meaning “ a garment in which a hole has been made,” or “ in<br>\
which holes have been made,”] and كِبَاشٌ مُذَبَّحَةٌ<br>\
[“ slaughtered rams ”]: and hence you may say<br>\
↓ قَصْرٌ مُشَيَّدٌ; because تَشْيِيدٌ denotes building, and<br>\
the act of building is repeated, and a building<br>\
becomes high by degrees. (L.)<br>\
مُشَيَّدٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
four places.<br>\
