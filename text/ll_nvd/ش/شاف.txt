I think that the right reading is شَأَفُ, and that its<br>\
verb is شَئِفَ, or it may be شَأْفُ, and inf. n. of<br>\
شُئِفَ,]) signifies The wound&#39;s becoming in a corrupt<br>\
state, so that it will hardly, or not at all, be<br>\
cured. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  شَئِفَ صَدْرُهُ عَلَىَّ His bosom<br>\
bore concealed enmity and violent hatred, or<br>\
rancour, malevolence, malice, or spite, against<br>\

اِسْتَشْأَفَتْ, said of a قُرْصَة, [so in the TA, an<br>\
evident mistranscription, app. for قَرْحَة, and so in<br>\
the next paragraph, i. e. an ulcer, or imposthume,]<br>\
means صَارَ لَهَا أَصْلٌ [It had, or acquired, root, or<br>\
rootedness, or permanence; as though it became<br>\
a شَأْفَة]. (TA.)<br>\
شَئِفٌ [part. n. of شَئِفَ, and properly meaning<br>\
Having an ulcer, or imposthume, such as is termed<br>\
شَأْفَة,] is applied as an epithet to a heart, in the<br>\
following verse, cited by IKtt,<br>\
يَا أَيُّهَا الجَاهِلُ أَلَّا تَنْصَرِفْ<br>\
وَلَمْ تُدَاوِ قُرْصَةَ القَلْبِ الشَّئِفْ<br>\
[in which قُرْصَةَ is doubtless a mistranscription (like<br>\
that in the next preceding paragraph) for قَرْحَةَ;<br>\
the obvious meaning of the verse being, (assumed tropical:)  O thou<br>\
ignorant one, wherefore wilt not thou revert, when<br>\
thou hast not cured the sore of an ulcerated heart?].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
?? An ulcer, or imposthume, (قَرْحَةٌ,) that<br>\
breaks out in the bottom of the foot, and is cauterized, (S, IAth, O, K,) or is cut, (Yaakoob,<br>\
IAth, O,) and goes away; (Yaakoob, S, IAth, O,<br>\
K;) and the word is also pronounced without ء<br>\
[i. e. شَافَةٌ]: (IAth, TA:) or an ulcer, or imposthume, in the foot of a person, who dies if it is<br>\
cut: (O, K:) and it is also said to be a tumour<br>\
in the hand, and foot, from the entering of a piece<br>\
of wood, or stick, into the flesh of the foot, or the<br>\
palm of the hand, and its remaining therein, so<br>\
that the place swells, and becomes large. (TA.)<br>\
اِسْتَأْصَلَ اللّٰهُ شَأْفَتَهُ (S, O, K) is a prov. (S, O)<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  May God cause him to go away like as<br>\
the شأفة above mentioned goes away: (S, O, K:)<br>\
or this means may God extirpate him: for ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
شَأْفَةٌ is also syn. with أَصْلٌ [i. e. Root, &amp;c.]: (O,<br>\
K:) so says Sh. (O.) [See also 10 in art. اصل:<br>\
and see what here follows.] ―<br>\
-b3-  It is also said to<br>\
signify The family and household of a man: and<br>\
hence the form of imprecation, اِسْتَأْصَلَ اللّٰهُ شَأْفَتَهُمْ<br>\
[May God extirpate their family and household].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  Enmity. (TA.)<br>\
شَأَفَةٌ, thus with fet-h to the ء, is an epithet<br>\
applied to a man, meaning Mighty, potent, powerful, or strong; inaccessible, or difficult of access.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
رِجْلٌ مَشْؤُوفَةٌ A foot affected with an ulcer, or<br>\
imposthume, such as is termed سَأْفَةٌ, breaking out<br>\
in it: (O, K:) from شُئِفَتْ رِجْلُهُ. (O, * K, * TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And مَشْؤُوفٌ, from شُئِفَ, Frightened, or<br>\
afraid; (A&#39;Obeyd, O, K;) applied to a man.<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, O.)<br>\
1<br>\
شُئِمَ عَلَيْهِمْ (S; MA, K,) inf. n. شُؤْمٌ, (MA,)<br>\
He (a man, S) was, or became, unlucky, or inauspicious, (صَارَ شُؤْمًا, S, K, in the MA شوم شد,)<br>\
to them: (S, MA, K;) as also شَأَمَهُمْ, and شَأَمَ<br>\
عليهم, and شَؤُمَ عليهم: (K:) or شَأَمَهُمْ, (AZ,<br>\
Ham p. 224,) or شَأَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ, (S,) or both of these,<br>\
(TA,) aor.<br>\
شَاَ^َ, (S, TA,) inf. n. شَأْمٌ, (TA,) he drew<br>\
upon them ill luck, or evil fortune; (S, TA;) or<br>\
caused ill luck, or evil fortune, to befall them<br>\
from him: (AZ, Ham ubi suprà, TA:) or شُؤُمٌ<br>\
as an inf. n. signifies the being unlucky: and the<br>\
rendering unlucky: and so شُومٌ [as it is commonly pronounced: see شُؤُمٌ below]. (KL.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
And شَأَمَهُمْ, inf. n. شَأْمٌ, so in the L; in the K,<br>\
↓ شَأَّمَهُمْ, inf. n. تَشْئِيمٌ; but the former is the right;<br>\
(TA;) He made them to go, or journey, to الشَّأْم<br>\
[i. e. Syria]. (K, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
شَاَّ^َ see what next precedes.<br>\
3<br>\
شَائِمْ بِأَصْحَابِكَ Take thou the direction of<br>\
the left hand with thy companions: (S, K, TA:)<br>\
يَامِنْ signifies “ take thou the direction of the<br>\
right hand. ” (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And شَآمَ He (a man)<br>\
came to الشَّأْم [i. e. Syria]: like يَامَنَ signifying<br>\
“ he came to El-Yemen. ” (TA. [See also 4.])<br>\
4<br>\
اشأم He desired the left: like as أَيْمَنَ signifies “ he desired the right. ” (TA in art. يمن.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And He (a man, S) came to الشَّأْم [i. e. Syria]:<br>\
(S, K, TA: [see also 3:]) or he went thither:<br>\
and أَيْمَنَ signifies “ he came to El-Yemen. ”<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  مَا أَشْأَمَهُ (S, K, TA) How unlucky, or<br>\
inauspicious, is he! (TA:) the vulgar say, مَا<br>\
أَيْشَمَهُ. (S, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تشأّم بِهِ, (MA, TA,) from الشُّؤْمُ, (TA,) He<br>\
found him, or it, unlucky, or inauspicious: and<br>\
he became unlucky by means of him, or it:<br>\
(MA:) or تشأّم signifies he had ill luck, or evil<br>\
fortune. (KL.) See also 6. ―<br>\
-b2-  And تشأّم He<br>\
took the direction of his left hand: (K, TA:)<br>\
and in like manner تَيَامَنَ, [whence it seems that<br>\
تشأّم in the sense expl. above may be a mistake<br>\
for ↓ تشآءم,] “ he took the direction of his right<br>\
hand. ” (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He asserted his relationship to [the people of] الشَّأْم [i. e. Syria]: (S, K:)<br>\
a verb similar to تكوّف and تقيّص. (S.)<br>\
6<br>\
تشآءموا بِهِ, (S, Msb, K, TA, &amp;c.,) in some<br>\
of the copies of the K ↓ تشأّموا, (TA,) [and in<br>\
like manner تشأّم بِهِ, which is often opposed to<br>\
تَيَمَّنَ بِهِ, (see an instance in Bd xvii. 14,) is used<br>\
in the K in art. عطس, and تشأّم مِنْهُ in the TA<br>\
in the same art. as on the authority of IKh,<br>\
whence it seems that both these verbs are correct<br>\
in the sense here following, though the former is<br>\
probably preferable, and بِهِ ↓ استشأم is used in the<br>\
same manner in “ Les Oiseaux et les Fleurs,”<br>\
p. 83, as mentioned by Freytag, so that تشأّم به<br>\
and استشأم are the contr. of تيمّن به and استيمن,]<br>\
They augured evil from him, or it; regarded<br>\
him, or it, as an evil omen; (Msb, KL; *) like<br>\
تَطَيَّرُوا بِهِ: (Msb:) deemed him, or it, unlucky,<br>\
or inauspicious. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تشآءم, thus, with medd,<br>\
also signifies He took the direction of الشَّأْم[i. e.<br>\
Syria]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 5.<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَشْاَ^َ see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
الشَّأْمُ, the name of a certain country [i. e.<br>\
Syria], is masc. and fem.; (S;) sometimes masc.:<br>\
(K:) and may also be pronounced الشَّامُ [as it<br>\
commonly is in the present day]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[And as this country lies on the north of Arabia,<br>\
الشَّأْمُ also signifies The northern region; opposed<br>\
to اليَمَنُ.]<br>\
شُؤْمٌ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) thus, with ء, but always<br>\
pronounced شُومٌ, without ء, (TA,) is an inf. n.:<br>\
(MA, KL: [see 1, first sentence, in two places:])<br>\
and signifies [as a simple subst.] Unluckiness, inauspiciousness, unfortunateness, unprosperousness,<br>\
evil fortune, or ill luck; contr. of يُمْنٌ; (S, K;)<br>\
[i. e.] i. q. َحْسٌ: (Har p. 158:) evil [of any<br>\
kind]; syn. شَرٌّ: (Msb:) [and particularly] an<br>\
evil omen: (PS:) and ↓ مَشْأَمَةٌ signifies the same<br>\
as شُؤْمٌ: (TA:) [or, like مَنْحَسَةٌ, a cause of unluckiness, &amp;c.:] مَشَائِمُ is a pl. of شُؤْمٌ, [or of<br>\
↓ مَشْأَمَةٌ: if of the former,] irreg., like as its syn.<br>\
مَنَاحِسُ is [said to be] of نَحْسٌ. (TA in art.<br>\
نحس.) It is said in a trad., إِنْ كَانَ الشُّوْمُ فَفِى<br>\
ثَلَاث ٍ المَرْأَةِ وَالدَّارِ وَالفَرَسِ, meaning If there be<br>\
that whereof the consequence is disliked, or hated,<br>\
and feared, [or if there be unluckiness,] it is in<br>\
three things, the wife, and the house, and the<br>\
horse: i. e., if any of you have a wife whose<br>\
companionship he dislikes, or a house in which<br>\
he dislikes dwelling, or a horse that he dislikes<br>\
taking for the purpose of keeping post on the<br>\
enemies&#39; frontier, let him separate himself therefrom, by divorcing the wife, and removing from<br>\
the house, and selling the horse: or, as some<br>\
say, the شؤم of the wife is her not producing<br>\
children; and that of the house, its straitness, and<br>\
the badness of its neighbour; and that of the<br>\
horse, one&#39;s not going to war upon it. (JM.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also مَشْؤُومٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also Black camels: and<br>\
حِضَارٌ signifies “ white ” camels, (K, TA,) and is<br>\
also written and pronounced حَضَارٌ: (TA:) neither<br>\
of these has a sing.: (K:) both occur in a verse<br>\
of Aboo-Dhu-eyb: but accord. to one reading<br>\
thereof it is شِيم; pl. of أَشْيَمُ: so says AA: and<br>\
IJ says that شُومٌ, [without ء,] being originally<br>\
شُيْمٌ, of the measure فُعْلٌ, may also be pl. of<br>\
أَشْيَمُ. (TA.)<br>\
شَأْمَةٌ and ↓ مَشْأَمَةٌ The left, meaning the left<br>\
side or direction or relative location or place;<br>\
(S, K;) i. q. [يَسْرَةٌ and] مَيْسَرَةٌ; (S;) contr. of<br>\
يَمْنَةٌ and مَيْمَنَةٌ. (K.) One says of a man, قَعَدَ<br>\
شأْمَةٌ [He sat on the left]. (S.) And one says,<br>\
خُذْ بِهِمْ شَأْمَةً i. e. [Take thou with them] the<br>\
direction of the left hand. (S.) And نَظَرْتُ يَمْنَةً<br>\
وَشَأْمَةً [I looked in a right direction and in a left<br>\
direction]. (TA.) And hence ↓ أَصْحَابُ المَشْأَمَةِ,<br>\
in the Kur [lvi. 9 and xc. 19], (TA,) meaning<br>\
[The occupants of the left: or] those who shall<br>\
have their records given to them in their left<br>\
hands: or the occupants of the low, or ignoble,<br>\
place, or station: or the havers of unfortunateness (الشُّؤْم): and أَصْحَابُ المَيْمَنَةِ is expl. as<br>\
having the contr. senses. (Ksh and Bd in lvi. 9.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, the former, A mole (خَالٌ) upon the<br>\
person: thus, with ء, as mentioned by IAth:<br>\
also mentioned without ء in art. شيم. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also شَامَةٌ as meaning “ a black she-camel,”<br>\
in art. شيم.<br>\
شِئْمَةٌ Nature; natural, native, or innate, disposition, temper, or other quality or property:<br>\
(K, TA:) mentioned thus, as with ء, by AZ and<br>\
Lh, and said by IJ to be sometimes thus pronounced; but the pronunciation thereof with ء is<br>\
held by ISd to be extraordinary. (TA.) [See<br>\
art. شيم.]<br>\
شَامِىٌّ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) without ء, (TA,) and<br>\
↓ شَآم ٍ, (S, Msb, K,) of the measure فَعَال ٍ, (S,) an<br>\
allowable form, without ى, (Msb,) like تَهَام ٍ and<br>\
يَمَان ٍ, (TA,) and ↓ شَآمِىٌّ, (Sb, S, K,) [Syrian;]<br>\
of, or relating to, الشَّأْم: (S, Msb, K:) one<br>\
should not say شَأْم ٍ; any instance [of this] occurring by poetic license being accounted for as a<br>\
case of the use of the name of the country for the<br>\
rel. n.: (S:) the fem., applied to a woman, is<br>\
شَامِيَّةٌ and ↓ شَآمِيَةٌ, the latter without teshdeed:<br>\
(S, TA;) the pl. of شَامِىٌّ is شُوَامٌ, like غُرَابٌ [in<br>\
measure]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence, Northern.]<br>\
شَآم ٍ, and شَآمِيَةٌ the fem. of the former; and<br>\
شَآمِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
شَائِمٌ: see مَشْؤُومٌ.<br>\
أَشْأَمُ [More, and most, unlucky, inauspicious,<br>\
unfortunate, or unprosperous]. The Arabs say,<br>\
أَشْأَمُ كُلِّ امْرِئ ٍ بَيْنَ لَحْيَيْهِ, (Meyd, TA,) as some<br>\
relate it, or, as others relate it, فَكَّيْهِ, which means<br>\
the same, (Meyd,) [app. meaning accord. to the<br>\
TA, The most unlucky thing of every man is<br>\
between his two jaws, or the two lateral portions<br>\
of his lower jaw; but it is said that] أَشْأَمُ is here<br>\
used in the sense of شُؤْمٌ [i. e. the unluckiness, &amp;c.];<br>\
and in a similar manner [the contr.] أَيْمَنُ is used<br>\
[in the sense of يُمْن]: so says AHeyth: (Meyd:)<br>\
the prov. meaning the tongue. (AHeyth, TA.)<br>\
The fem. is شُؤْمَى. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) اليَدُ<br>\
الشُّؤْمَى The left hand or arm; contr. of اليُمْنَى;<br>\
(K, TA;) i. q. الشِّمَالُ. (TA.) It is said in a<br>\
trad., respecting camels, لَا يَأْتِى خَيْرُهَا إِلَّا مِنْ<br>\
جَانِبِهَا الأَشْأَمِ [Their goodness comes not save from<br>\
their left side]: i. e. they are milked and mounted<br>\
only from the left side. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also مَشْؤُومٌ,<br>\
in three places. ―<br>\
-b4-  Zuheyr, in the following saying,<br>\
فَتُنْتَجْ لَكُمْ غِلْمَانَ أَشْأَمَ كُلُّهُمْ<br>\
كَأَحْمَرِ عَاد ٍ ثُمَّ تُرْضِعْ فَتَفْطِمْ<br>\
uses it in the sense of the inf. n. شُؤْم; (S;) meaning غِلْمَانَ شُؤْم ٍ: (S, and EM p. 124:) he says,<br>\
And it, i. e. war, will bring forth for you boys<br>\
of ill luck, or evil omen; all of them like Ahmar<br>\
of&#39; Ád: then it will suckle these boys, and wean<br>\
them: by Ahmar of &#39; Ád, he means Ahmar of<br>\
Thamood, for Ahmar was the surname of him<br>\
who hamstrung the she-camel of Sálih, and his<br>\
name was Kudár: he says thus for the sake of<br>\
the measure: or, as some say, Thamood were<br>\
called &#39;Ád-el-Ákhireh. (EM.)<br>\
مَشْأَمَةٌ: see شُؤْمٌ, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also<br>\
شَأْمَةٌ, likewise in two places.<br>\
مَشْؤُومٌ, (S, MA, K, KL,) and مَشُومٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
the latter like مَقُولٌ, (TA,) [a contraction of the<br>\
former,] Unlucky, or inauspicious, (S, MA, K,<br>\
KL,) عَى قَوْمِهِ [to his people, or party], (S,<br>\
MA, K,) and عَلَى نَفْسِهِ [to himself]: (Ksh and<br>\
Bd in lvi. 9:) [and so ↓ شُؤْمٌ; (as in an ex. in<br>\
the first sentence of this art.;) this being an epithet as well as a subst., like its syn. نَحْسٌ; syn.<br>\
with مَشْؤُومٌ, like as نَحْسٌ is syn. with مَنْحُوسٌ;<br>\
and app., like نَحْسٌ, used alike as sing. and pl.,<br>\
for it seems to be originally an inf. n.:] and so<br>\
↓ شَائِمٌ; (K;) or this signifies drawing ill luck,<br>\
or evil fortune, upon his people [and upon himself]: (S, TA:) and أَشَائِمُ, a pl., likewise signifies unlucky, or inauspicious; (KL;) contr. of<br>\
أَيَامِنُ; (S, K, TA;) these being pls. of ↓ أَشْأَمُ<br>\
and أَيْمَنُ: (TA:) the pl. of مَشْؤُومٌ is مَشَائِيمُ, (S,<br>\
KL, TA,) which is extr., for by rule it should be<br>\
مَشْؤُومُونَ. (TA.) One says also ↓ طَائِرٌ أَشْأَمُ<br>\
meaning [An omen] happening, or occurring,<br>\
(جَار ٍ,) with unluckiness, or inauspiciousness; [i. e.<br>\
an unlucky, or inauspicious, omen;] (K, TA;)<br>\
and [in like manner] ↓ طَيْرٌ أَشْأَمُ: and the pl. is<br>\
