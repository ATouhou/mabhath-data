شَمْعٌ and شَمَعٌ, both chaste accord. to ISd:<br>\
(TA:) accord. to Fr, (S, O, Msb, TA,) the former<br>\
is post-classical; (S, O, Msb, K, TA;) but ISd<br>\
says that this is a mistake: (TA:) accord. to ISk<br>\
one should say the latter, and not the former:<br>\
(TA:) or accord. to him, the word is with fet-h<br>\
to the م, and some of the Arabs make the م<br>\
quiescent: accord. to Th, it is with fet-h to the م;<br>\
and if you will, you may make it quiescent:<br>\
accord. to IF, the م is sometimes with fet-h; so<br>\
that he gives one to understand that it is more frequently made quiescent: (Msb:) A kind of thing<br>\
with which one lights himself: (S, O, Msb, K:)<br>\

rather the former and wax-candles, are meant by شَمْعٌ<br>\

bees&#39; wax]: (Lth, K:) the n. un., (CK,) or what<br>\
denotes a piece, or portion, thereof, (so in copies<br>\
of the K and in the TA,) is with ة, (K, TA,)<br>\
