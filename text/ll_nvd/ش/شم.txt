شَمِمْتُ, aor. أَشَمُّ; and شَمَمْتُ, aor. أَشُمُّ;<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K;) the latter mentioned by AO;<br>\
(S, TA;) third pers. of each شَمَّ; (Mgh;) inf. n.<br>\
شَمُّ (S, Msb, K) and شَمِيمٌ, (S, K,) which are of<br>\
both verbs, (TA,) and شِمِّيمَى, mentioned by Z<br>\
(K, TA) alone; (TA;) I smelt, i. e. perceived<br>\
by the nose, (K,) a thing, (S, Msb, K, *) or an<br>\
odour; (Mgh;) and ↓ اِشْتَمَمْتُ signifies the same;<br>\
(S, Msb, K, TA; [اَشْمَمْتُهُ in the CK is a mistranscription for اِشْتَمَمْتُهُ;]) and ↓ تَشَمَّمْتُ also, (K,)<br>\
and ↓ شَمَّيْتُ, thus in the copies of the K, but<br>\
correctly ↓ شَمَّمْتُ: (TA: [both, however, are<br>\
mentioned in the CK: the former like قَصَّيْتُ for<br>\
قَصَّصْتُ:]) or الشَّىْءَ ↓ تَشَمَّمْتُ signifies شَمِمْتُهُ فِى<br>\
مُهْلَةٍ [I smelt the thing leisurely, or gently]: (S,<br>\
TA:) or الشَّىْءَ ↓ تشمّم and ↓ اشتمّهُ both signify<br>\
he put the thing near to his nose in order that he<br>\
might draw in its odour. (AHn, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See an<br>\
ex. in a prov. mentioned voce خِمَارٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,]<br>\
شُمَّ (assumed tropical:)  He was tried, or proved by trial or experiment or experience; syn. اُخْتُبِرَ. (IAar, K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
شَمَّ, see. pers. شَمِمْتَ, aor. يَشَمُّ, (Msb,) inf. n. شَمَمٌ,<br>\
(S, * Msb, K, *) He (a man) was high, or elevated,<br>\
in the nose. (S, * Msb, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,]<br>\
شَمَّ, (K,) [sec. pers. شَمِمْتَ,] inf. n. شَمَمٌ, (TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  He (a man, TA) magnified himself; or behaved<br>\
proudly, or haughtily. (K, TA. [And اشمّ has a<br>\
similar meaning.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  [This verb is also probably<br>\
used in other senses, said of a mountain, &amp;c.: see<br>\
شَمَمٌ below.] ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 4, near the end.<br>\
2<br>\
شَمَّمْتُ and<br>\
شَمَّيْتُ: see above, in two places.<br>\
3<br>\
شَامَّا, (K,) inf. n. مُشَامَّةٌ, (S, TA,) They smelt<br>\
each other; (S, * K;) as also ↓ تشامّا, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَشَامٌّ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] شَامِمْهُ (tropical:)  Look thou to see<br>\
what is with him, or in his mind, (مَا عِنْدَهُ, S, K,<br>\
TA,) and draw near to him, (K, TA,) and seek<br>\
after the knowledge of what is with him, or in<br>\
his mind, (ما عنده,) by means of informations and<br>\
disclosure; as though each smelt what was with<br>\
the other in order to act according thereto. (TA.)<br>\
And hence the saying, شَامَمْنَاهُمْ ثُمَّ نَاوَشْنَاهُمْ (tropical:)  [We<br>\
endeavoured, or looked, to ascertain their condition; then we engaged them in near, though not<br>\
close, conflict]. (TA.) You say also, شَامَمْتُ<br>\
الرَّجُلَ meaning [simply] (assumed tropical:)  I drew near to the<br>\
man. (S.) مُشَامَّةٌ [used tropically] signifies (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
looking into a thing. (KL.) And (assumed tropical:)  The approaching the enemy so that the two parties see<br>\
each other. (S.)<br>\
4<br>\
اشمّهُ إِيَّاهُ He made him to smell it, or perceive<br>\
it by the nose. (K.) You say, أَشْمَمْتُهُ الطِيبَ [I<br>\
made him to smell the perfume]. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And [hence] one says to the prefect, or governor,<br>\
or prince, or commander, أَشْمِمْنِى يَدَكَ أُقَبِّلْهَا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Suffer me to approach thy hand that I may kiss<br>\
it]; (S, * TA;) a phrase like نَاوِلْنِى يَدَكَ, (TA,)<br>\
but better than the latter phrase: so says Kh. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And اشمّ الخِتَانَ, and اشمّت البَظْرَ, (tropical:)  He, and<br>\
she, i. e. the operator, took, (K, TA,) or cut off,<br>\
(TA,) a small portion of the prepuce, and of the<br>\
بَظْر [q. v.]: (K, TA:) or the latter signifies she<br>\
cut off a portion of the نَوَاة [q. v.], not extirpating<br>\
it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And اشمّ الحَرْفَ, (S, * K,) inf. n.<br>\
إِشْمَامٌ, (S,) (assumed tropical:)  He made the consonant to have a<br>\
smack of the dammeh or the kesreh, (lit., made it<br>\
to smell, S, or to taste, K, the dammeh or the<br>\
kesreh,) in such a manner (S, K) that the<br>\
إِشْمَام, (S,) or that the dammeh or kesreh, (K,)<br>\
was not heard, (S, K,) what is termed إِشْمَامُ<br>\
الحَرْفِ being less than what is termed رَوْمُ الحَرَكَةِ,<br>\
the former being apparent only by the motion of<br>\
the lip, (S,) or of the upper lip, (so in one of my<br>\
copies of the S,) no account being taken of it,<br>\
(S, K,) i. e. of the dammeh or kesreh, (K,) it not<br>\
being reckoned as a حَرَكَة because of its feebleness,<br>\
the consonant in this case being quiescent or like<br>\
that which is quiescent, (S,) and the prosodical<br>\
measure not being broken thereby: (K:) for ex.,<br>\
in the following verse,<br>\
مَتَى أَنَامُ لَا يُؤَرِّقْنِى الكَرِى<br>\
لَيْلًا وَلَا أَسْمَعُ أَجْرَاسَ المَطِى<br>\
[meaning الكَرِىّ and المَطِىّ, (as is said in one of my<br>\
copies of the S,) i. e. When I sleep, he who lets<br>\
beasts on hire will not render me wakeful by night,<br>\
nor do I hear the bells of the camels on which<br>\
people ride], the Arabs [or, as is said in the TA,<br>\
some of the Arabs] make the ق [in يؤرّقنى] to<br>\
have a smack of the dammeh; but if you took<br>\
account of the حَرَكَة of the إِشْمَام [in this case,]<br>\
the measure of the verse would be broken, [the<br>\
foot] رقنى الكرى becoming, in the scanning,<br>\
مُتَفَاعِلُنْ, which may be only in the كَامِل;<br>\
whereas this verse is of the رَجَز: (Sb, S:) another<br>\
case of إِشْمَام is that of the ى in دُوَيْبَّةٌ, [in which<br>\
that letter is quiescent, but made to have a smack<br>\
of kesreh,] as is the same letter in every similar<br>\
case, in a dim. noun, when followed by a doubled<br>\
letter. (Zj, T in art. دب.) Also He pronounced<br>\
the consonant with a حَرَكَة [or vowel-sound]<br>\
between damm and kesr, apparent only in utterance, not in writing; as in قِيلَ and غِيضَ in the<br>\
Kur xi. 46. (I &#39;Ak pp. 130 and 131.) [See also<br>\
رَوْمُ الحَرَكَةِ, voce رَامَ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  [Golius explains اشمّ as<br>\
signifying also “ Reduxit, fecit ut converteret se<br>\
ab aliqua re; ” as on the authority of the KL; in<br>\
my copy of which, however, I do not find this meaning.]<br>\
-A2-  اشمّ, (S, K,) inf. n. إِشْمَامٌ, [as an intrans.<br>\
verb,] said of a man, (S,) also signifies He passed<br>\
by, or along, raising his head; (S, K, TA;) and<br>\
magnified, or exalted, himself; behaved proudly,<br>\
or disdainfully; or elevated his nose, from pride.<br>\
(TA. [See also 1, near the end.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He<br>\
turned away from a thing. (K.) One says<br>\
بَيْنَا هُمْ فِى وَجْهٍ إِذْ أَشَمُّوا, i. e. [While they were in<br>\
a certain direction, lo,] they turned away; (S,<br>\
TA, as from AA;) or ↓ شَمُّوا. (Thus in one of my<br>\
copies of the S [but I think it to be a mistranscription].) And اشمّ القَوْمُ The people, or party,<br>\
deviated in their directions to the right and left:<br>\
a phrase heard in this sense by AA. (S.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَشَمَّ3َ see 1, in three places.<br>\
6<br>\
تَشَاْمَ3َ see 3, first sentence.<br>\
8<br>\
إِشْتَمَ3َ see 1, in two places.<br>\
10<br>\
استشمّ He desired to smell. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
He perceived a smell, or an odour, from a thing.<br>\
(KL.) ―<br>\
-b3-  دَخَلَ المُخَاطُ أَنْفَهُ فَأْسْتَشَمَّهُ فَأَدْخَلَهُ فِى<br>\
حَلْقِهِ, said of a man, means اِسْتَنْشَقَهُ [i. e. (tropical:)  The<br>\
mucus entered his nose, and he snuffed it up, and<br>\
made it to pass into his fauces]; the verb being<br>\
metaphorically thus used, like as الاِسْتِنْشَاقُ is<br>\
metaphorically used for الشَّمُّ. (Mgh.)<br>\
شَمَمٌ inf. n. of the intrans. verb شَمَّ [q. v.].<br>\
(Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Used as a simple subst.,] Highness of the nose: (Msb:) or highness of the bone<br>\
of the nose, (S, K,) and beauty thereof, (K,) with<br>\
evenness, or straightness, of its upper part, (S, K,<br>\
when there is in it a gibbousness it is termed<br>\
قَنًا, S,) and uprightness of the end, or lowest part:<br>\
(K:) or, as some say, this last quality [alone]:<br>\
(TA:) or length of the end, or lower part, of the<br>\
nose, so that it extends over the middle of the<br>\
mustache, (وُرُودُ الأَرْنَبَةِ,) with beautiful evenness,<br>\
or straightness, of the bone, and highness thereof<br>\
greater than the highness that is termed ذَلَفٌ:<br>\
or length and slenderness of the nose, and a<br>\
downward extending of its رَوْثَة [i. e. end or tip,<br>\
or part where the blood that flows from the<br>\
nostrils drops or drips]: (K:) or [simply] length.<br>\
in the nose. (Ham p. 789.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, in a man,<br>\
The quality of having what is termed شَمَمٌ of the<br>\
nose. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And hence, (tropical:)  Self-magnification,<br>\
or pride, or haughtiness: see 1, near the end.] ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And (tropical:)  Generosity. (Ham p. 728.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also Highness, (K,) or tallness of the head, (S,) of a<br>\
mountain. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And (tropical:)  Nearness: and<br>\
(tropical:)  remoteness: thus having two contr. meanings.<br>\
(K, TA.) It has both of such meanings in the<br>\
phrase دَارُهُ شَمَمٌ (tropical:)  [His house, or abode, is near:<br>\
and, remote]: (K, TA:) and in the phrase<br>\
رَأَيْتُهُ مِنْ شَمَمٍ (tropical:)  [I saw him, or it, from within<br>\
a short distance: and, from afar]. (TA.)<br>\
شَمُومٌ A thing [odorous, fragrant, or] fit to be<br>\
smelt. (KL.)<br>\
شَمِيمٌ High, or elevated: (S, K:) applied in<br>\
this sense to a [camel&#39;s saddle such as is called]<br>\
قَتَب. (S.)<br>\
شَمَّامٌ A sort of melon resembling a small<br>\
colocynth, [or rather a small melon resembling a<br>\
colocynth,] streaked with redness and greenness and<br>\
yellowness: called in Pers. دَسْتَنْبُويَه [i. e. “ perfume ”]; (K;) originally دَسْتْ بُوى [or دَسْتْ<br>\
بُويَهْ]: (TA:) its odour is cool, pleasant, lenitive,<br>\
and narcotic; and the eating of it is laxative to<br>\
the bowels: (K:) [The cucumis dudaïm of Linn.;<br>\
called by Forskål cucumis schemmam: the latter<br>\
thus describes it (Flora Aegypt. Arab. p. 169):<br>\
“ Caules 5-sulcati, setis rigidis, scandentes,<br>\
cirrhosi: folia cordato-oblonga, acuta, subsinuata,<br>\
dentato-repanda, hispida: calyces villosi, molles:<br>\
flores flavi, conferti in alis: fructus globosoovatus, glaberrimus, magnitudine citri, flavus,<br>\
maculis inæqualibus, fulvo-ferrugineis, versus<br>\
polos in lineas confluentibus; pulpa aquosa,<br>\
seminibus tota plena: fructus juvenis villosus;<br>\
maturus glaber: odor, fortis nec ingratus; eamque<br>\
ob caussam cultus; non edulis: ” in the present<br>\
day, the same appellation is applied in Egypt to<br>\
several species of melon, of pleasant odour and<br>\
taste; but this application I believe to be of very<br>\
late origin: see also لُفَّاحٌ: and see De Sacy&#39;s<br>\
“ Rel. de l&#39;Égypte par Abd-allatif,” pp. 126-7.]<br>\
شَمَّامَاتٌ Sweet odours that one smells. (K.)<br>\
شَمَاشِمُ Ripe dates remaining upon the raceme.<br>\
(AZ, K.)<br>\
[<br>\
شَامٌّ Smelling, or perceiving by the nose.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
يَا ابْنَ شَامَّةِ الوَذْرَةِ [O son of her who smells the<br>\
وَذْرَة] is an expression of reproach. (S.)<br>\
أَشَمُّ, applied to a man, (Msb,) Having that<br>\
quality of the nose which is termed شَمَمٌ; (Msb,<br>\
K;) or so أَشَمُّ الأَنْفِ, thus applied: (S:) fem.<br>\
شَمَّآءُ: (Msb, TA:) and pl. شُمٌّ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[hence, (tropical:)  Self-magnifying, or proud, or haughty:<br>\
or] a chief characterized by disdainfulness, scornfulness, or disdainful and proud incompliance,<br>\
(K, TA,) and high-minded. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A<br>\
mountain tall, (S, TA,) or high, (TA,) in the<br>\
head. (S, TA.) [And High, as applied to a place<br>\
of ascent in a mountain: see an ex. of the pl. in a<br>\
verse cited voce تَصَدَّفَ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And A shoulder<br>\
high in the head of its bone. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Freytag<br>\
mentions two other meanings: ―<br>\
-b6-  “ Ventus ex<br>\
alto veniens, qui penetrantioris est odoratus: ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
[and] fem. شَمَّاء Jugum extensum in monte: ”<br>\
from the Deewán of the Hudhalees.]<br>\
مُشِمٌّ [Turning away, or averse]. One says,<br>\
عَرَضْتُ عَلَيْهِ كَذَا فَإِذَا هُوَ مُشِمٌّ لَا يُرِيدُهُ [I offered<br>\
to him such a thing, and lo, he was averse, not<br>\
desiring it]. (S.)<br>\
[<br>\
مِشَمٌّ An instrument of smelling; like as مِسْمَعٌ<br>\
signifies “ an instrument of hearing. ” ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
its pl.] مَشَامُّ signifies Noses. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [This pl.<br>\
is expl. by Jac. Schultens, as meaning Perfumes<br>\
(odoramenta): so says Freytag.]<br>\
مَشْمُومٌ A thing that is smelt; such as any<br>\
sweet-smelling plant: like as مَأْكُولٌ signifies “ a<br>\
thing that is eaten: ” (Msb:) [and] musk: (S,<br>\
K:) [pl. مَشْمُومَاتٌ.]<br>\
