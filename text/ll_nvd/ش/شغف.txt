شَغَفَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. شَغْفٌ, (Msb,) He, or it, struck, or smote,<br>\
his شَغَاف; (O, K;) like كَبَدَهُ meaning “ he, or<br>\
it, struck, or smote, his كَبِد ” [or “ liver ”];<br>\
(O, TA;) so says Yoo: (TA:) or it (i. e. love)<br>\
rent the شَغَاف of his heart: (Fr, TA:) or it<br>\
(love) reached his شَغَاف: (ISk, S, TA:) or<br>\
شَغَفَ قَلْبَهُ it (love) reached the شَغَاف of his heart,<br>\
i. e. his pericardium. (Msb.) I&#39;Ab read, [in the<br>\
Kur xii. 30,] قَدْ شَغَفَهَا حُبًّا, and expl. the meaning to be [He has affected her so that] the love<br>\
of him has entered beneath the شَغَاف: (S, TA:)<br>\
or the meaning is, the love of him has struck, or<br>\
smitten, her شَغَاف: (Lth, O, TA:) or he has rent<br>\
the شَغَاف of her heart, i. e. its حِجَاب, [app.<br>\
meaning her midriff,] so as to reach her heart,<br>\
with love: (Bd:) Abu-l-Ash-hab read قَدْ شَغِفَهَا<br>\
حُبًّا, with kesr to the غ, [meaning he has became<br>\
attached to her, or has loved her,] like the reading of Thábit El-Bunyánee, شَعِفَهَا, with kesr to<br>\
the unpointed ء: (O, TA:) [for] شَغِفَهُ, aor.<br>\
شَغَفَ,<br>\
[inf. n. app. شَغَفٌ,] signifies he became attached<br>\
to him, or loved him. (K, TA.) One says also,<br>\
شَغَفَهُ المَالُ, meaning The property became embellished to him, [or pleasing to him,] so that he<br>\
loved it. (Msb.) And شُغِفَ بِالشَّىْءِ, like عُنِىَ,<br>\

thing; or fond of it. (TA.) And شَغِفَ بِالشَّىْءِ,<br>\
like فَرِحَ, He became disquieted, or disturbed, by<br>\
the thing. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
مَا هٰذِهِ الفُتْيَا الَّتِى تَشَغَّفَتِ النَّاسَ, a saying of<br>\
I&#39;Ab, means [What is this judicial sentence] that<br>\
has put vain suggestions into the minds of the<br>\
people, and separated them? as though it entered<br>\
the شَغَاف of their hearts. (TA.) [See also 1 in<br>\
arts. شعب and شغب.]<br>\

K,) or غِشَآء, (Msb,) of the heart: (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K:) or [app. a mistake for “ and,” as will be<br>\
shown by what follows,] its حِجَاب [generally<br>\
meaning the midriff], (K,) [here said to be,]<br>\
accord. to AHeyth, a certain fat that clothes the<br>\
heart: (TA:) [J seems to confound the غِلَاف of<br>\
the heart with its حِجَاب; for after “ the غَلاف of<br>\
the heart,” he adds, “and it is a skin beneath it<br>\
(دُونَهُ), like the حِجَاب: ”] or the حَبَّة (K) or<br>\
the سُوَيْدَآء [both generally meaning the core]<br>\
thereof: (O, K:) or the place of entrance (مَوْلج)<br>\
of the phlegm: (Lth, O, K:) and ↓ شَغْفٌ and<br>\
↓ شَغَفٌ signify the same in the two senses, (K,)<br>\
or in the first and second senses: (TA:) or<br>\
القَلْب ↓ شَغْفُ and ↓ شَغَفُهُ signify the same as<br>\
شَغَافُهُ, accord. to AHeyth: (O:) the pl. of the<br>\
شَغَاف of the heart is شُغُفٌ; which is metaphorically applied in a saying of &#39;Alee to the place<br>\
of the fœtus [in the belly]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also,<br>\

agreeable with analogy as the name of a disease,<br>\
(TA,) A certain disease that attacks one, beneath<br>\
the شَرَاسِيف [pl. of شُرْسُوفٌ, q. v.], in the right<br>\
side: (A&#39;Obeyd, S, O, K:) and (some say, TA)<br>\
a pain of the belly: (K, TA: [in the CK, البَظْر is<br>\
erroneously put for البَطْن:]) and (some say,<br>\
TA) a pain of the شَغَاف of the heart: (K, TA:)<br>\
accord. to As, شَغَافٌ signifies a certain disease in<br>\
the heart, which, if it reaches to the spleen, kills<br>\
the patient. (TA.)<br>\
شُغَافٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مَشْغُوفٌ Insane, or mad; (O, K;) like مَشْعُوفٌ.<br>\

is embellished [or rendered pleasing,] so that he<br>\
loves it. (Msb.)<br>\
