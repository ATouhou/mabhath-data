شَأَوْتُ القَوْمَ, (AZ, S,) aor.<br>\
شَاُ^َ, (JM, PS,)<br>\
or<br>\
شَاَ^َ, (Ham p. 786,) inf. n. شَأْوٌ, (AZ, S, K,) I<br>\
preceded, or outwent, the people, or party. (AZ,<br>\
S, K. *) Accord. to [several of] the copies of the<br>\
K, شَآءَهُ i. e. like شَاعَهُ in measure, which is incorrect, [in other copies ↓ شَآءَاهُ, agreeably with<br>\
what is said in the S,] signifies He strove, or<br>\
contended, with him to precede him, or outgo him:<br>\
or he preceded him, or outwent him: but in the<br>\
S it is said, شَآءَاهُ, of the measure فَاعَلَهُ, signifies he<br>\
strove, or contended, with him to precede him, or<br>\
outgo him: and شَآءَهُ like شَأَاهُ, [the former belonging to art. شوأ and] formed by transposition, signifies he preceded him, or outwent him; and both<br>\
of these are used by the poet (El-Hárith Ibn-Khálid El-Makhzoomee, TA) in his saying,<br>\
مَرَّ الحُدُوجُ وَمَا شَأَوْنَكَ نَقْرَةً<br>\
وَلَقَدْ أَرَاكَ تُشَآءُ بِالأَظْعَانِ<br>\
this [passage in the S], however, is taken from<br>\
what is said by A&#39;Obeyd, in [his work] “ ElGhareeb el-Musannaf,” which is as follows:<br>\
شَآءَنِى الأَمْرُ, like شَاعَنِى [in measure], and شَآنِى,<br>\
like شَعَانِى, mean the affair, or event, grieved<br>\
me; and thus in the verse of El-Hárith Ibn-Khálid, which he cites; and the same is said in<br>\
the T on the authority of IAar, who says that<br>\
the poet has used two dial. vars.: [accordingly<br>\
the verse may be rendered, The camels with their<br>\
saddles upon them passed along and they grieved<br>\
thee not at all; but I see thee that thou art<br>\
grieved by the women borne in the camel-vehicles:]<br>\
it is said in the M, شَآءَنِى الشَّىْءُ means the thing<br>\
preceded me, or outwent me: and also the thing<br>\
grieved me: formed by transposition from شَآنِى,<br>\
as is proved by its having no inf. n.: IAar says<br>\
that they are two dial. vars. because of his not<br>\
being a grammarian. (TA.) [See also 8.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
And شَأَوْتُ البِئْرَ, (Lh, TA,) or شأوت مِنَ البِئْرِ, (S,)<br>\
inf. n. شَأْوٌ, (K, TA,) I drew forth the earth from<br>\
the well: (S, K: *) or I drew forth a basketful of<br>\
earth (شَأْوًا) or two basketfuls of earth (شَأْوَيْنِ)<br>\
from the well. (Lh, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
شَآءَاهُ: see 1. يُشَاوِى occurs in a verse of<br>\
Milhah El-Jarmee, meaning يُسَابِقُ, from شَأْوٌ<br>\
meaning طَلَقٌ: one says شَأَاهُ, aor. يَشْأَاهُ, meaning<br>\
سَبَقَهُ: but the verb of the measure regularly formed<br>\
from الشَّأْوُ is شَآءى; so that يشاوى is formed by<br>\
transposition and by the change of the ء into ى.<br>\
(Ham p. 786.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَشَآءَى مَا بَيْنَهُمَا, (S, K, TA, [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, تَشاوَى,]) like تَشَاعَى [in measure],<br>\
(S,) The space between them two became farextending. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تشآءى القَوْمُ The people,<br>\
or party, became scattered, or dispersed. (S, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِشْتَأَى He preceded, or outwent: (S, K:)<br>\
so says El-Mufaddal. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He gave ear,<br>\
hearkened, or listened. (S, K.)<br>\
شَأْوٌ The utmost extent, term, limit, point,<br>\
reach, or goal. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A heat, or<br>\
single run to a goal or limit: so in the saying,<br>\
عَدَا شَأْوًا (S) or جَرَى شَأْوًا (Msb) [He (a horse,<br>\
TA) ran a heat]. ―<br>\
-b3-  And i. q. هِمَّةٌ: thus in the<br>\
saying, إِنَّهُ لَبَعِيدُ الشَّأْوِ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily he is far-aiming,<br>\
or far-aspiring, in purpose, desire, or ambition]:<br>\
(Lh, TA:) and سَأْوٌ is a dial. var. thereof. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A [basket such as is termed] زَبِيل; and<br>\
so ↓ مِشْآةٌ: (K:) or ↓ زَبِيل in<br>\
which the earth of a well is taken forth; of the<br>\
measure of مِشْعَاةٌ; and the pl. is مَشَآء ٍ: (S:) and<br>\
شَأْوٌ signifies, (S,) or signifies also, (K,) the earth<br>\
that is taken forth from a well (S, K) with the<br>\
like of the مِشْآة, (as in a copy of the S,) or such<br>\
as fills the مشْآة: (so in another copy of the S<br>\
[agreeably with what next follows]:) a زَبِيل of<br>\
the earth of a well. (As, T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,<br>\
i. e. as being likened to a زبيل of the earth of a<br>\
well, (assumed tropical:)  The dung that the he-ass and the she-ass<br>\
casts forth: (As, T, TA:) or the dung of the she-camel; (M, K;) but the more approved word is<br>\
[سَأْوٌ,] with س. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also The nose-rein<br>\
(زِمَام) of a she-camel. (Lth, K.)<br>\
مِشْآةٌ; see the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
مُشْتَأ ٍ [part. n. of 8, q. v.: ―<br>\
-b2-  and] i. q. مُخْتَلِفٌ<br>\
[app. as meaning Disagreeing, differing, or discordant]. (TA.)<br>\
