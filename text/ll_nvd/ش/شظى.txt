شَظِىَ, [aor. and inf. n. as in the next sentence,] said of a stick, or branch, or piece of<br>\
wood, [&amp;c.,] It was, or became, split. (AHn,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Said of a horse, (As, S, Mgh, K,) aor.<br>\
شَظَىَ,<br>\
inf. n. شَظًى, (K,) His شظى, (As, S, Mgh, K,)<br>\
i. e. the small bone called الشَّظَى, (As, S, Mgh, *)<br>\
moved from its place, (As, S, Mgh,) or became<br>\
displaced, syn. زُوِىَ, (A, TA,) or became unsteady, or wabbling: (K:) and so ↓ تشظّى, (K,<br>\
TA,) this latter on the authority of ISd: (TA:)<br>\
or [the inf. n.] شَظًى, accord. to some, signifies<br>\
the sinews&#39; becoming split, or slit: (As, S, Mgh:)<br>\
or شَظًى has this meaning also; (K;) and so<br>\
↓ تَشَظّ. (ISd, K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Accord. to the K,<br>\
شَظِىَ, said of a corpse, is syn. with شَصِىَ: but<br>\
correctly, the former verb is شَظَى, aor.<br>\
شَظِىَ, inf. n.<br>\
شُظِىٌّ, and the latter verb is شَصَا [q. v.], as they<br>\
are said to be by Az: and in like manner, شَظِى,<br>\
aor.<br>\
شَظِىَ, is said of a سِقَآء [or skin for water or<br>\
milk], meaning It being filled, its legs became<br>\
raised, or raised high. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
شظّى, (TA,) inf. n. تَشْظِيَةٌ, (K, TA,) He<br>\
separated into several, or many, portions or<br>\
divisions; or dispersed, or scattered; (K, * TA;)<br>\
[a thing; or] (tropical:)  a company of men. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And He made [a horse] to be such that his<br>\
شظى (شَظَاهُ) became unsteady, or wabbling.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اشظاهُ He, or it, hit, or hurt, his شظى<br>\
(شَظَاهُ): (K:) Sgh says, by rule it should be<br>\
شَظَاهُ [i. e. the verb should be thus, being derived<br>\
from الشَّظَى, like قَفَاهُ from القَفَا]. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تشظّى, said of a stick, or branch, or piece of<br>\
wood, (A, Msb, K, TA,) or of a thing, (S, TA,)<br>\
It split, or became split, in pieces, or in several<br>\
or many places: (A, Msb, TA:) or it became<br>\
scattered, or dispersed, in splinters, or pieces<br>\
split off: (S, K:) and it [i. e. anything, nothing<br>\
in particular being specified,] became separated<br>\
into several, or many, portions or divisions; or<br>\
dispersed, or scattered. (TA.) One says also,<br>\
تشظّى اللُّؤْلُؤُ عَنِ الصَّدَفِ (tropical:)  [The pearls became<br>\
separated, or scattered, from the oyster-shells].<br>\
(A, TA.) See also 1, in two places.<br>\

رباعية broke, or became broken. (TA.)<br>\
شَظًى, of a staff, or stick, The like of a لِيطَة<br>\
[i. e. a piece, or sharp piece, of the exterior portion], that enters into the hand, and wounds it.<br>\
(Ham p. 474. [But شَظِيَّةٌ is more commonly<br>\
used in this and similar senses.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  A small bone,<br>\
(عُظَيْمٌ, K, TA, [in the CK عَظْمٌ, i. e. a bone, and<br>\
so in my copy of the Mgh,]) or a slender small<br>\
bone, (As, S,) adhering to the ذِرَاع [here app.<br>\
meaning the arm-bone of a horse], (As, S, K,) or<br>\
to the bone of the ذِرَاع, (Mgh,) which sometimes<br>\
moves from its place; (As, S, Mgh; [see شَظِيَّةٌ;])<br>\
or to the knee; (K;) thus in the M; (TA;) or to<br>\
the وَظِيف [app. here meaning the fore shank of a<br>\
horse]; (K;) thus in the A: (TA:) or certain<br>\
small sinews (عَصَب) therein; (K;) i. e. in the<br>\
وظيف; thus in the T. (TA.) AO says that<br>\
تَحَرُّكُ الشَّظَى [i. e. The motion of the شظى from<br>\
its place (see 1)] is like what is termed اِنْتِشَارُ<br>\
العَصَبِ, except that the horse has more power of<br>\
endurance of the latter than of the former. (T,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Portions of a thing that are separated, or dispersed, or scattered. (Har p. 160.)<br>\
It is said by ISd to be a pl. [or rather it is a coll.<br>\
gen. n.] of which the sing. [or n. un.] is شَظَاةٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A portion of fur upon the mark<br>\
left by a gall, or sore, on the back [of a camel],<br>\
such as reaches the utmost extent thereof: (K,<br>\
accord. to the TA: [الشَّظَى being there expl. by<br>\
the words الوبرة على اثر الدبرة حتى تبلغ اقصاها:<br>\
in the CK, and in my MS. copy of the K, الدَّبَرَةُ<br>\
على أَثَرِ الدَّبَرَةِ فى المَزْرَعَةِ حَتَّى تَبْلُغَ أَقْصَاهَا;<br>\
which Freytag renders “ sulcus ad latus alterius<br>\
in arvo ductus, ut ejus extremum attingeret; ”<br>\
but which, I think, evidently presents a mistranscription and an interpolation:]) the pl. is<br>\
أَشْظِيَةٌ: and sometimes there are ten [?] portions<br>\
of fur [of this description, app. meaning, upon one<br>\
camel: the word that I here render “ ten ” is<br>\
more like عشه than عشر; but the final letter, as is<br>\
often the case in the MS. of the TA, is written in<br>\
a form differing little from a common form of ر]:<br>\
mentioned by ISh, from Et-Táïfee; as is said in<br>\
the T. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The followers, and incorporated confederates, of a people, or party;<br>\
(S, K;) contr. of the صَمِيم thereof: (S:) or the<br>\
freedmen and followers. (M, TA.)<br>\
شَظِىٌّ and شِظِىٌّ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
شِظِيَّةٌ A splinter, or piece split off, (T, S, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) of a staff, or stick, and the like,<br>\
(S,) or of wood, (T, Mgh, Msb,) and the like,<br>\
(Msb,) or of a reed, or cane, (T, Mgh,) or of<br>\
silver, (T, TA,) or of bone, (T, Mgh,) or of anything: (M, K:) pl. شَظَايَا (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and<br>\
↓ شَظِىٌّ, (K,) [or rather this is a coll. gen. n.,] like<br>\
as رَكِىٌّ is of رَكِيَّةٌ, (TA,) or a quasi-pl. n., like<br>\
عَبِيدٌ, improperly said by IAar to be pl. of شَظًى,<br>\
(ISd, TA,) and ↓ شِظِىٌّ, (K, TA, [in the latter<br>\
as omitted in the K, with kesr to the ش on<br>\
account of the same vowel-sound following,])<br>\
mentioned by Sgh, from Ks. (TA.) AO terms<br>\
the إِبْرَة [q. v.] at the head of the elbow [of<br>\
the horse] a شَظِيَّة adhering to the ذِرَاع, but not<br>\
[forming a portion] of it. (TA. [See شَظًى.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also A bow: (K:) because its wood is split: on<br>\
the authority of AHn. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The shankbone. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A great mass of rock wrenched<br>\
from the side of a mountain; (K, TA;) as though<br>\
it were a piece split off, broken [off] but not<br>\
parted so as to form an interstice, or a gap: and<br>\
also a piece cut from a mountain, like a house or<br>\
a tent: and it is said in the copies of the K that<br>\
شِظْيَةٌ, with kesr, signifies the same; but the word<br>\
is correctly ↓ شِنْظِيَةٌ, with an augmentative ن as<br>\
in the T, and mentioned also by Hr in the<br>\
“ Ghareebeyn: ” pl. of the former شَظَايَا. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  See also شَنْظَاةٌ.<br>\
شَاظٍ part. n. of شَظِىَ [q. v.] said of a horse.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
شَنْظَاةٌ The head, or top, of a mountain, (K,<br>\
TA,) [and so ↓ شَظِيَّةٌ, (Freytag, from the Deewán<br>\
of the Hudhalees,)] resembling the شُرْفَة [q. v.]<br>\
of a mosque: pl. شَنَاظٍ: and الجِبَالِ ↓ شَوَاظِى<br>\
[likewise] signifies the heads, or tops, of the<br>\
mountains. (TA.)<br>\
شِنْظِيَةٌ: see شَظِيَّةٌ, near the end.<br>\
شَوَاظِى الجِبَالِ: see شَنْظَاةٌ.<br>\
[<br>\
مَشْظًى, pl. مَشَاظِى, A fragment of wood:<br>\
(Freytag, from the Deewán of Jereer:) but the<br>\
pl., when indeterminate, is correctly مَشَاظٍ.]<br>\
