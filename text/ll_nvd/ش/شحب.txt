شَحَبَ, aor.<br>\
شَحُبَ (S, A, O, K, &amp;c.) and<br>\
شَحَبَ, (A,<br>\
O, K, &amp;c.,) but the former more commonly<br>\
obtains, (TA,) inf. n. شُحُوبٌ; (S, O, K;) and<br>\
شَحُبَ, (Fr, S, A, O, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. شُحُوبَةٌ, (Fr,<br>\
S, O, K,) but this form of the verb is disapproved<br>\
by AZ and &#39;Iyád; (TA; [in which, however,<br>\
nine authorities for it are mentioned;]) said of<br>\
one&#39;s body; (Fr, S, O;) or of one&#39;s colour, or<br>\
complexion, (A, K,) and so شُحِبَ, (A, O, K,)<br>\
inf. n. شُحُوبٌ; (A;) [It was, or became, altered<br>\
[for the worse, wan, or haggard], (Fr, S, A, O,<br>\
K, &amp;c.,) in consequence of emaciation, (K,) or<br>\
hunger, (A, K,) or sleeplessness, and the like,<br>\
(A,) or travel, (K,) or work, or disease, or impatience, or distress or fatigue: or, accord. to the<br>\
author of the “ Wá&#39;ee,” شُحُوبٌ signifies emaciation itself: (TA:) in this sense, it is of the dial.<br>\
of Benoo-Kiláb. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  شَحَبَ الأَرْضَ,<br>\
(IDrd, O, K,) aor.<br>\
شَحَبَ, inf. n. شَحْبٌ, (IDrd, O,)<br>\
He pared the ground, or scraped off its superficial part, with a shovel, (IDrd, O, K,) or some<br>\
other thing: of the dial. of El-Yemen. (IDrd, O.)<br>\
شَحِبٌ: see what follows.<br>\
شَاحِبٌ A man having his colour, or complexion,<br>\
altered [for the worse, wan, or haggard], (TA,)<br>\
or so شَاحِبُ اللَّوْنِ, (A,) in consequence of disease,<br>\
or travel, or the like: (TA: [see 1:]) and emaciated, or lean; (TA, KL;) as also ↓ شَحِبٌ.<br>\
(KL.) It is said in a trad., لَا تَلْقَى المُؤْمِنَ إِلَّا<br>\
شَاحِبًا [Thou wilt not find the believer otherwise<br>\
than wan, or haggard; or emaciated, or lean];<br>\
because شُحُوب is one of the effects of fear, and<br>\
of paucity of food, and of little enjoying of plentifulness and pleasantness or easiness, and softness<br>\
or delicacy, of life. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also applied<br>\
as an epithet to a sword, meaning Altered in its<br>\
colour by blood that has dried upon it: used in<br>\
this sense by the poet Taäbbata-sharrà. (TA.)<br>\
