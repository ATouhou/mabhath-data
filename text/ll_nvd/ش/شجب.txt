[sorts;] a speaker of what is bad, or an utterer of<br>\
foul, or obscene, language, aiding in wrongdoing;<br>\
and a speaker of what is good, and an enjoiner<br>\

which clothes are put: (S:) Suh says, in the R,<br>\
that they used to call the water-skin شَجْبٌ, and<br>\
they used not to hold it otherwise than suspended,<br>\
so that مِشْجَبٌ properly signifies the piece of<br>\
wood, or stick, to which the water-skin is suspended: then they amplified the application of<br>\
this word so as to call thereby the thing upon which<br>\
clothes are suspended: (MF, TA:) the pl. is<br>\
مَشَاجِبُ. (A.)<br>\
