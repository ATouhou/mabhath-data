شَرَهَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. شَرَهٌ, (S, MA, Mgh, Msb,) said of a man,<br>\
(S,) He was vehemently desirous, or greedy;<br>\
(MA;) or very vehemently desirous, or very<br>\
greedy; (Mgh, Msb;) or overcome by vehement<br>\
desire, or greediness; (S, K;) of the food (MA,<br>\
Mgh, Msb) &amp;c.: (Msb:) or, as some say, he was<br>\
affected with the worst of vehement desire, or of<br>\
greediness. (TA.)<br>\
شَرِهٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ شَرْهَانُ (Lth, K) [Vehemently desirous, or greedy; (see 1;) or] very<br>\
vehemently desirous, or very greedy; (Msb;) or<br>\
overcome by vehement desire, or greediness: (K:)<br>\
or, accord. to some, affected with the worst of vehement desire, or of greediness. (TA.)<br>\
شَرْهَانُ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
إِهْيَا أَشَرْ إِهْيَا, with kesr to the ء in اهيا, and with<br>\
fet-h to the ء in اشر, and to the ش, (K, TA,) and<br>\
with the ر quiescent, (TA,) [mentioned in this<br>\
art. in consequence of the supposing اشر with اهيا<br>\
after it to compose one word,] but this is not its<br>\
proper place; (K, TA;) so says Sgh; (TA;) an<br>\
ancient Greek expression, (K, TA,) or Syriac,<br>\
or, more correctly, Hebrew; (TA;) [the truth is<br>\
that it is a mode of writing the Hebrew words<br>\
?? “ I shall be that I am,” in<br>\
Exod. iii. 14, rendered in our Authorized Version “ I am that I am; ”] said in prayer; (TA;)<br>\
[virtually] meaning The existing from eternity,<br>\
that will not cease to be: (K:) Sgh says, thus one<br>\
of the learned men of the Jews pronounced it to<br>\
me in &#39;Adan Abyan: and some say هيا شراهيا, as<br>\
though abridging it, meaning يَا حَىُّ يَا قَيُّومُ<br>\
[which may be rendered O Ever-living, O Selfsubsisting by Whom all things subsist; but the<br>\
latter epithet is variously explained]; so says<br>\
Lth: (TA:) the people now say أَهْيَا شَرَاهِيَا, (so in<br>\
some copies of the K,) with fet-h to the ء in اهيا,<br>\
and dropping the ء in what follows this word,<br>\
[which, however, probably means that they say<br>\
أَهْيَا شَرْ أَهْيَا,] or, as in the handwriting of Sgh,<br>\
with medd to the ء in the former; (TA;) [in my<br>\
MS. copy of the K آهِيَا شَراهيا; in the CK, آهِيًّا<br>\
شَراهِيًّا;] which is said in the K to be a mistake<br>\
accord. to the assertion of the learned men of the<br>\
Jews: but this, which is said to be a mistake, is<br>\
what commonly obtains in the books of the<br>\
people, [i. e. of the Jews,] and they seldom, or<br>\
never, pronounce it otherwise than thus: As says<br>\
that the vulgar say يَا هِيَا, which is post-classical;<br>\
correctly يَا هَيَاهَ [or يَا هَيَا], with fet-h to the ء:<br>\
AHát says, I think it to be originally يَا هَيَا شراهيا<br>\
[which is inconsistent with the Hebrew]: and<br>\
Ibn-Buzurj says, they said يَا هِيَا and يَا هَيَا in<br>\
speaking to one from a near place. (TA.)<br>\
