hired him, or took him as a hireling]: (TA:)<br>\
from الشِّتَآءُ [i. e. the subst.]; (S;) like مُرَابَعَةً<br>\

خَرَفِىٌّ, (S,) [signifying Of, or relating to, the<br>\
season called شِتَآء,] are rel. ns. of شِتَآءٌ (S, Msb, K)<br>\
regarded as pl. of شَتْوَةٌ: (Msb:) or it may be<br>\
that they formed the rel. n. from شَتْوَةٌ, and discarded that of شِتَآءٌ; as is said in the M: (TA:)<br>\
or those who regard شِتَآءٌ as a sing. make its rel. n.<br>\
to be ↓ شِتَائِىٌّ and ↓ شِتَاوِىٌّ. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
الشَّتَوِىُّ, (S, K,) thus with fet-h to the ش and ت,<br>\
(K,) signifies also The rain of the [season called]<br>\
شِتَآء; and so ↓ الشَّتِىُّ; (S, K;) the latter occurring in a verse (S, TA) of En-Nemir Ibn-Towlab.<br>\

زَمَنٌ; and see also نَوْءٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The increase, or<br>\
offspring, (نِتَاج,) of sheep and goats in the<br>\
[season called] رَبِيع [by which is here meant<br>\
the season called الرَّبِيعُ الأَوَّلُ and رَبِيعُ الكَلَأِ, commencing in January and ending in March: see<br>\
the former of the two tables mentioned above]:<br>\
(Aboo-Nasr, TA voce صَفَرِىٌّ [q. v.]:) [and in<br>\
like manner, of camels; for] شَتْوِىٌّ and شَتَوِىٌّ and<br>\
↓ شَتِىٌّ are applied to the young camel brought<br>\
forth by her that is termed ↓ مُشْتٍ, meaning<br>\
مُرْبِعٌ [i. e. that brings forth in the (season called)<br>\
رَبِيع]. (TA.)<br>\
شِتَآءٌ a word of well-known meaning [in the<br>\
sense in which it is most commonly used, i. e.<br>\
Winter]; (S;) one of the quarters [of the circle]<br>\
of the seasons; (K;) and ↓ شَاتَاةٌ signifies the<br>\
same; (Sgh, K;) [and so does ↓ شَتِيَّةٌ; (see an<br>\
ex. voce رِبْعِىٌّ;)] and so does ↓ مَشْتَاةٌ: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) [also the half-year commencing at the<br>\
autumnal equinox:] ISk says, السَّنَةُ is with the<br>\
Arabs a name for twelve months: then they<br>\
divided it into two halves, and commenced the<br>\
سَنَة [or year] at the commencement of the شِتَآء<br>\
because this word is masc. and the word صَيْف<br>\
[meaning in this case the “ half-year commencing<br>\
at the vernal equinox ”] is fem.: then they divided<br>\
the شِتَآء into two halves; the شتوى being the<br>\
former; and the ربيع, the latter; [but this is a<br>\
manifest mistake, probably attributable to a<br>\
copyist; for, as is well known, the former half is<br>\
called the رَبِيع; and the latter, the شِتَآء or ↓ شَتْوَة;]<br>\
each consisting of three months; and in like<br>\
manner the صَيْف and the قَيْظ consist, each, of<br>\
three months: (TA:) also one of the six seasons<br>\
into which the year is divided, each whereof consists of two months; namely, the season [commencing in November and ending in January,]<br>\
next after that called الخَرِيفُ: (S and K voce<br>\
رَبِيعٌ: [see this word; and see, again, the former<br>\
of the two tables mentioned above:]) accord. to<br>\
Mbr, (S,) شِتَآءٌ is pl. of ↓ شَتْوَةٌ; (S, Msb, K;) it<br>\
is said to be so by IF on the authority of Kh,<br>\
and by some on the authority of Fr or some<br>\
other: or شِتَآءٌ and ↓ شَتْوَةٌ signify the same, (K,)<br>\
as is said in the M; (TA;) [i. e.] some say that<br>\
الشِّتَآءُ is a proper name for the quarter [&amp;c.]:<br>\
(Msb:) the pl. is أَشْتِيَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) i. e. pl. of<br>\
شِتَآءٌ, (S, Msb,) because أَفْعِلَةٌ, as pl. of فِعَالٌ, is<br>\
peculiar to a masc. [noun]; (Msb;) and شُتِىٌّ<br>\
also, (K, TA,) originally أُشْتُوىٌ [a mistake for<br>\
شُتُوىٌ], written in the Tekmileh شِتِىٌّ, as on the<br>\
authority of Fr.: (TA:) the pl. of its syn. ↓ مَشْتَاةٌ<br>\
is مَشَاتٍ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, i. e. شِتَآءٌ, Hail, syn.<br>\
بَرَدٌ, (K, TA, [in the CK بَرْدٌ,]) that falls from the<br>\
sky. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Drought, or dearth: (K,<br>\
and Ham pp. 117 and 150:) this meaning being<br>\
assigned to the شتآء exclusively of the صَيْف because in it the people keep to the tents, not going<br>\
forth to seek after herbage. (TA.)<br>\
شَتِىٌّ: see شَتْوِىٌّ, in two places.<br>\
شَتِيَّةٌ: see شِتَآءٌ [with which it is syn.].<br>\
شِتَائِىٌّ and شِتَاوِىٌّ: see شَتْوِىٌّ.<br>\
شَاتٍ Entering the شِتَآء, which, with them, [i. e.<br>\
the Arabs, and app. in this case,] means [a season<br>\
of] drought, or dearth. (Ham pp. 149-50.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
يَوْمٌ شَاتٍ A day intensely cold: (Msb:) or a day<br>\
in which is بَرَد [i. e. hail (accord. to the CK بَرْد)];<br>\
and in like manner غَدَاةٌ شَاتِيَةٌ [a morning in<br>\
which is hail]. (K, TA.)<br>\
شَاتَاةٌ: see its syn. شِتَآءٌ.<br>\
مَشْتًى The place [in which one resides, stays,<br>\
dwells, or abides, during the season] of the شِتَآء<br>\
[or winter, &amp;c.]; as also ↓ مَشْتَاةٌ: (K:) pl. مَشَاتٍ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُشْتٍ: see شَتْوِىٌّ, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in<br>\
a trad., as some relate it, وَالنَّاسُ مُرْمِلُونَ مُشْتُونَ,<br>\
meaning The people being in a state of straitness,<br>\
or dearth, and hunger, and paucity of milk: but<br>\
IAth says that the reading commonly known is<br>\
مُسْنِتُونَ. (TA.)<br>\
مَشْتَاةٌ: see شِتَآءٌ, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and مَشْتًى.<br>\
