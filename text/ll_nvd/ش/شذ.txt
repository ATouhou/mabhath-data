شَذِ3َ and<br>\
شَذُ3َ, (S, M, L,<br>\
Msb, K,) the former agreeable with analogy, and<br>\
that which is mentioned by the leading writers on<br>\
inflection, and the latter anomalous, (TA,) and<br>\
Esh-Shiháb mentions<br>\
شَذَ3َ, but this is not known,<br>\
and there is no reason for it unless فَعِلَ be established as a form of the pret., and this has not been<br>\
mentioned, (MF,) inf. n. شُذُوذٌ (S, M, Mgh, L,<br>\
Msb, K) and شَذٌّ, (M, L, K,) It (a thing, M, L)<br>\
was, or became, apart, (S, A, L, Msb,) and it<br>\
fell, or went, or came, out, or forth, (S, M, L, K,)<br>\
from the generality of things, or the general<br>\
assemblage, main body, bulk, or common mass,<br>\
(S, M, A, L, K,) to which it pertained, (M, L,)<br>\
or from other things: (Msb:) it (anything) was,<br>\
or became, apart, or alone: and he (a man) was,<br>\
or became, apart from his companions, or alone:<br>\
(Lth, L:) and (assumed tropical:)  he [app. a beast] took fright, and<br>\
ran away. (Msb.) You say, شَذَّ عَنْهُ It was, or<br>\
became, apart, &amp;c., from it. (S, L.) And شَذَّ<br>\
عَنِ الجَمَاعَةِ He was, or became, apart from the<br>\
collective body [or generality] of people. (Mgh.)<br>\
And مَا يَشِذُّ عَلَيْهِ شَىْءٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Nothing is out of his<br>\
way, or sphere, or compass]. (S and K in art.<br>\
حوذ.) And شَذَّ الحَصَى The pebbles became scat-<br>\
tered, or dispersed. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شَذَّ, aor.<br>\
شَذِ3َ and<br>\
شَذُ3َ,<br>\
inf. n. شُذُوذٌ and شَذٌّ, also signifies (tropical:)  It (a word,<br>\
form or measure, construction, or government,)<br>\
deviated from the common, or constant, course of<br>\
speech in respect of analogy, or rule; deviated<br>\
from common, or constant, analogy, or rule; was<br>\
extraordinary, or exceptional, as to rule; or was<br>\
anomalous, abnormal, or irregular: and it (the<br>\
same) deviated from the common, or constant,<br>\
course of speech in respect of usage; deviated<br>\
from common, or constant, usage; was extraordinary, or exceptional, as to usage; or was unusual: [the verb is used absolutely to express each<br>\
of these meanings; the context in general showing<br>\
clearly which meaning is intended: the former is<br>\
that which is most frequently intended: and] the<br>\
former meaning is also expressed by the phrase<br>\
شَذَّ فِى القِيَاسِ or عَنِ القِيَاسِ: and the latter, by<br>\
the phrase شَذَّ فِى الاِسْتِعْمَالِ. (Mz, 12th نوع.)<br>\

اشذّهُ; (S, M, K;) and ↓ شذّذهُ; (K;) and<br>\
↓ شَذَّهُ, aor.<br>\
شَذُ3َ, only; (M, K;) but As disallows<br>\
this last form of the verb; (IJ, L;) He, or it,<br>\
caused it to be, or to become, apart, (S, L,) to<br>\
fall, or go, or come, out, or forth, from the<br>\
generality of things, or the general assemblage,<br>\
main body, bulk, or common mass, (S, M, L, K,)<br>\
to which it pertained: (M, L:) and the first<br>\
signifies he removed it, and put it far away;<br>\
namely, a thing: (K:) and he set him, or exposed<br>\
him, apart from his companions, or alone: (IJ,<br>\
L:) and he scattered, or dispersed, it. (IKtt.)<br>\
A poet says,<br>\
فَأَشَذَّنِى لِمُرُورِهِمْ فَكَأَنَّنِى<br>\
غُصْنٌ لِأَوَّلِ عَاضِدٍ أَوْ عَاصِفِ<br>\
[And he, or it, (perhaps meaning fortune,) exposed me apart from my companions, to their<br>\
passing by, or by reason of their passing away,<br>\
so that I was as though I were a branch that<br>\
should become a prey for the first lopper or<br>\
stormy wind]. (IJ, L.) And one says of a she-camel, اشذّت الحَصَى She scattered, or dispersed,<br>\
the pebbles [with her feet]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اشذّ also<br>\
signifies نَادٍّ ↓ جَآءَ بِقَوْلٍ شَاذٍّ (assumed tropical:)  [He said what<br>\
deviated from the common course of speech]. (K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
شَذَّان: see شَاذٌّ, in four places.<br>\
شِذَّانٌ The [species of lote-tree called] سِدْر. (K.)<br>\
شَاذٌّ A thing that is, or becomes, apart, (S, L,<br>\
Msb,) and that falls, or goes, or comes, out, or<br>\
forth, from the generality of things, general<br>\
assemblage, main body, bulk, or common mass,<br>\
(S, L,) to which it pertains: (L:) anything apart,<br>\
or alone: and a man apart from his companions,<br>\
or alone: (Lth, L:) and [app. a beast] taking<br>\
fright, and running away: (Msb:) شُذَّانٌ is a pl.<br>\
thereof, like as شُبَّانٌ is of شَابٌّ; [and so is شُذَّاذٌ,<br>\
agreeably with analogy;] and ↓ شَذَّان is used in<br>\
a similar sense, but is an epithet of the measure<br>\
فِعْلَان, not a pl. of شَاذٌّ. (L.) مَا يَدَعُ فُلَانٌ شَاذًّا وَلَا<br>\
نَادًّا إِلَّا قَتَلَهُ [Such a one does not leave any one<br>\
apart from his companions, nor any one taking<br>\
fright and running away, but he slays him,] is<br>\
said of a courageous man whom no one encounters without his slaying him. (IAar, L.) And<br>\
one says شُذَّانُ قَوْمٍ Those, of a people, who have<br>\
become apart, or separate, from their companions.<br>\
(L, from a trad.) And شُذَّاذُ النَّاسِ Those who are<br>\
among a people but do not belong to their tribes<br>\
(S, L) nor to their places of abode: (L:) and<br>\
those who are scattered, or dispersed, of people;<br>\
(A, L;) as also النَّاسِ ↓ شَذَّانُ, (S, L,) and شُذَّانُهُمْ.<br>\
(L.) And قَوْمٌ شُذَّاذٌ A people not among their<br>\
own tribe nor in their own places of abode: (L,<br>\
K: *) or a people among another people, not<br>\
among their own tribes nor in their own places of<br>\
abode. (M, TA.) And شُذَّاذُ الآفَاقِ The strangers.<br>\
(Har p. 352.) And جَاؤُوا شُذَّاذًا They came few<br>\
in number. (L, K. *) And الإِبِلِ ↓ شَذَّانُ and<br>\
شُذَّانُهَا Those that are scattered, or dispersed, of<br>\
the camels. (L.) And شُذَّانُ الحَصَى (M, L) and<br>\
الحَصَى ↓ شَذَّانُ (S, IJ, M, L, K) What are scatterred, or dispersed, of pebbles; (S, L, K;) what<br>\
have flown about, and become scattered or dispersed, thereof: (M, L:) and in like manner one<br>\
says of other things, (L, K,) or of similar things.<br>\
(M, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to a word, form or measure,<br>\
construction, or government, it signifies (tropical:)  Deviating from the common, or constant, course of<br>\
speech in respect of analogy, or rule; deviating<br>\
from common, or constant, analogy or rule;<br>\
extraordinary, or exceptional, as to rule; or<br>\
anomalous, abnormal, or irregular: such a word,<br>\
&amp;c., though itself admitted if agreeable with<br>\
common usage, is not taken as an example to be<br>\
imitated: also, applied to the same, deviating<br>\
from the common, or constant, course of speech in<br>\
respect of usage; deviating from common, or<br>\
constant, usage; extraordinary, or exceptional, as<br>\
to usage; unusual: [used absolutely to express<br>\
each of these significations; the context in general<br>\
showing clearly which signification is meant: the<br>\
former is that which is most frequently intended:]<br>\
a word, &amp;c., may be شاذّ in respect of usage but<br>\
agreeable with common analogy or rule; as the<br>\
pret. of يَذَرُ and يَدَعُ; and the regular phrase<br>\
مَكَانٌ مُبْقِلٌ, the epithet more commonly heard<br>\
being بَاقِلٌ: and شاذّ in respect of analogy, or rule,<br>\
but agreeable with common usage; as أَخْوَصَ<br>\
الرِّمْثُ, and اِسْتَصْوَبْتُ الأَمْرَ: and شاذّ in respect of<br>\
analogy, or rule, and of usage, together; as ثَوْبٌ<br>\
مَصْوُونٌ, and مِسْكٌ مَدْوُوفٌ: (Mz, 12th نوع: [and<br>\
the like is said, but less fully, in the Msb:]) the<br>\
pl. masc. is شُذَّاذٌ; and pl. fem. شَوَاذُّ. (Mz, ib.)<br>\
See 4, last sentence. [See also the contr. مُطَّرِدٌ:<br>\
and see شَذَّ, latter part.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Applied to a tradition,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Having a single ascription, attested by a [single]<br>\
sheykh, whether he be trustworthy or not: in<br>\
the latter case, not accepted: in the former case,<br>\
one hesitates respecting it, and does not adduce it<br>\
as an argument, or evidence. (KT.)<br>\
