شَدَّ, as an intrans. verb, aor.<br>\
شَدِ3َ, inf. n. شِدَّةٌ:<br>\
see 8; and see also شِدَّةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] لَشَدَّ مَا is an<br>\
expression used in the same sense as لَعَزَّ مَا (A<br>\
and K in art. عز) and لَحَقَّ مَا: (A and TA in that<br>\
art.:) [and in like manner without the ل: thus]<br>\
one says, شَدَّ مَا أَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ, meaning حَقَّ أَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ<br>\
[i. e. It is distressing, or it distresses me, that<br>\
thou art going away]: and if you please, you may<br>\
consider شَدَّ as similar to نِعْمَ; as when you say,<br>\
نِعْمَ العَمَلُ أَنَّكَ تَقُولُ الحَقَّ [Excellent, or most<br>\
excellent, is the deed, thy saying the truth].<br>\
(Sb, TA.) [And it is also used to render intensive<br>\
a verb following it; as in the saying, لَشَدَّ مَا<br>\
أَبْغَضَنِى Much indeed, or greatly indeed, did he<br>\
hate me.] ―<br>\
-b3-  شَدَّ عَلَيْهِ, aor.<br>\
شَدَ3َ (S, L) and<br>\
شَدِ3َ, (L,)<br>\
inf. n. شَدٌّ (S, L) and شُدُودٌ, (L,) He charged, or<br>\
made an assault or attack, upon him, in war, or<br>\
battle. (S, L.) You say, شَدَّ عَلَى العَدُوِّ شَدَّةً<br>\
وَاحِدَةً, and شَدَّاتٍ كَثِيرَةً, He made one charge, or<br>\
assault, or attack, upon the enemy, and many<br>\
charges, &amp;c. (L.) And شَدَّ عَلَى قِرْنِهِ بِسِكِّينٍ, or<br>\
بِعَصًا, He made an assault, or attack, upon his<br>\
adversary, with a knife, or with a staff; as also<br>\
عَلَيْهِ ↓ اشتدّ. (Mgh.) And شَدَّ الذِّئْبُ عَلَى الغَنَمِ<br>\
The wolf asaulted, or attacked, the sheep or goats.<br>\
(L.) In the phrase, شَدُّوا الإِغَارَةَ, the meaning is<br>\
شَدُّوا لِلْإِغَارَةِ [They made a charge for the purpose<br>\
of a sudden attack upon an enemy, or a predatory<br>\
incursion]; and therefore الاغارة is put in the<br>\
accus. case, not as an objective complement.<br>\
(Ham p. 8.) ―<br>\
-b4-  شَدَّ, (S,) aor.<br>\
شَدُ3َ and<br>\
شَدِ3َ, (TK,)<br>\
inf. n. شَدٌّ, (S, L, K,) also signifies He ran; (S,<br>\
L, * K; *) and so ↓ اشتدّ. (S, L, K.) رُبَّ شَدٍّ فِى<br>\
الكُرْزِ [Many a run is in the sack] is a prov.,<br>\
originating from the fact that a man riding a<br>\
pregnant mare was pursued by an enemy, and<br>\
she cast her foal, which ran with its mother,<br>\
whereupon the horseman alighted, and carried it<br>\
off in a sack; and the enemy overtook him, and<br>\
said to him, “Throw to me the foal;” and he<br>\
replied in these words, meaning that the foal was<br>\
of generous race: it is applied to him whose<br>\
internal, or intrinsic, qualities are commended.<br>\
(Meyd.) And one says, شَدَّ فِى العَدْوِ, (A, Mgh,<br>\
L,) inf. n. شَدٌّ; (L;) and ↓ اشتدّ; (A, Mgh, L;)<br>\
He hastened, or was quick, in running: (Mgh,<br>\
L:) and شَدَّ الإِحْضَارَ [meaning the same]. (S in<br>\
art. افر.) ―<br>\
-b5-  شَدَّ النَّهَارُ, (S, L,) and الضُّحَى, (L,)<br>\
inf. n. شَدٌّ; (L, K; but in the latter, النَّار is erroneously put for النَّهَار; TA;) and ↓ اشتدّ; (L;)<br>\
The day, and the morning, became advanced, the<br>\
sun being high. (S, * L, K. *) [See also شَدٌّ below.]<br>\
-A2-  شَدَّهُ, aor.<br>\
شَدُ3َ (S, A, L, Msb) and<br>\
شَدِ3َ, the latter<br>\
anomalous, for the aor. of a trans. verb of this<br>\
class, of the measure فَعَلَ, should be<br>\
شَدُ3َ only, and<br>\
that of an intrans. verb of the same class and<br>\
measure should be<br>\
شَدِ3َ, and this is the only instance,<br>\
or almost the only one, of its kind, with both of<br>\
these forms of aor., except عَلَّ [and بَتَّ] and نَمَّ<br>\
الحَدِيثَ, but there is one trans. verb of the same<br>\
class having the latter form of aor. only, namely,<br>\
حَبَّ, (Fr, S, L,) inf. n. شَدٌّ, (L, Msb, K,) He<br>\
made it, or rendered it, hard; used in relation to<br>\
substances and attributes: (L:) he made, or rendered, it, or him, firm, compact, or sound; and<br>\
strong, powerful, or forcible; vigorous, robust, or<br>\
sturdy; syn. أَحْكَمَهُ, (L,) and قَوَّاهُ; (S, A, L, K; *)<br>\
as also ↓ شدّدهُ, [inf. n. تَشْدِيدٌ,] i. e. as syn. with<br>\
احكمهُ (L) and قوّاهُ: (S, A, L:) he bound, or tied,<br>\
him, or it, firmly, fast, or strongly; syn. أَوْثَقَهُ:<br>\
[which may also be meant to convey the signification immediately preceding this last:] (S, L,<br>\
Msb, K:) and [simply] he tied, bound, or made<br>\
fast, him, or it; syn. رَبَطَهُ. (S and Msb and K<br>\
&amp;c. in art. ربط.) One says, شَدَّ عَضُدَهُ i. e. He<br>\
strengthened [his fore arm, or perhaps his upper<br>\
arm, but the former is app. here meant]. (S, L.)<br>\
And شَدَّ عَلَى يَدِهِ He strengthened him, [lit. his<br>\
arm, or hand,] and aided him. (L.) And شَدَّ<br>\
اللّٰهُ مُلْكَهُ, and ↓ شَدَّدَهُ, God strengthened, or may<br>\
God strengthen, his dominion. (S, L. [See also<br>\
a similar ex. voce أَزْرٌ.]) And شَدَّ العُقْدَةَ [He tied<br>\
firmly or fast or strongly, or he pulled tight, or<br>\
tightened, the knot], (A, Mgh, Msb,) and الوَثَاقَ<br>\
[the bond]. (Kur xlvii. 4.) [And شَدَّ الدَّابَّةَ He<br>\
bound the saddle on the beast: see an ex. voce<br>\
دَلِيلٌ.] شَدُّ الرِّحَالِ [lit. The binding of the camels&#39;<br>\
saddles upon their backs] is a metonymical phrase<br>\
for (tropical:)  the going a journey. (Mgh, Msb.) And<br>\
شَدُّ المِئْزَرِ, occurring in a trad., [lit. The binding<br>\
of the waist-wrapper upon the waist] is a metonymical phrase for (tropical:)  the avoiding of women: or the<br>\
exerting oneself, or employing oneself vigorously<br>\
or laboriously, in work: or for both of these<br>\
together. (L.) مَا أَمْلِكُ شَدًّا وَلَا إِرْخَآءً [lit. I<br>\
possess not power to tighten nor to slacken] means<br>\
I am not able to do anything. (TA.) [And شَدَّهُ<br>\
also signifies He pressed, compressed, or squeezed,<br>\
it: and he pulled, or strained, it.] وَاشْدُدْ عَلَى<br>\
قُلُوبِهِمْ, in the Kur [x. 88], means And put Thou<br>\
a seal upon their hearts, so that they may not<br>\
heed admonition, nor be disposed, or directed, to<br>\
that which is good. (L.)<br>\
-A3-  أَشَدُّ لَقَدْ كَانَ كَذَا,<br>\
as also أَشَدُ without teshdeed, means أَشْهَدُ [q. v.]:<br>\
(K:) a strange saying. (TA.)<br>\

He made it, or rendered it, namely, a beating, and<br>\
anything, hard to be borne, heavy, vehement,<br>\
violent, intense, severe, strict, rigorous, or excessive; he intensified it, or aggravated it: (L:)<br>\
تَشْدِيدٌ is the contr. of تَخْفِيفٌ [in this sense and<br>\
in other senses here following]. (S.) [Hence, the<br>\
objective complement being understood,] one says,<br>\
شدّد عَلَيْهِ, (A, Msb,) which is the contr. of خَفَّفَ<br>\
[i. e. of خَفَّفَ عَنْهُ; thus meaning He rendered his<br>\
burden, suffering, distress, uneasiness, or the like,<br>\
hard to be borne, heavy, vehement, violent, intense,<br>\
severe, strict, rigorous, or excessive; intensified it,<br>\
or aggravated it; or he pressed hard upon him;<br>\

rigour]: (Msb:) and مَنْ شَدَّدَ شَدَّدَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ<br>\

opposed to تَخْفِيفٌ, also signifies The characterizing of a letter by a lengthened pronunciation<br>\
equivalent in grammatical analysis and in prosody<br>\
to doubling, denoted in writing by the sign called<br>\
↓ شَدَّة, i. e. by the sign ّ over that letter; as also<br>\
تَثْقِيلٌ.] ―<br>\

Whoso contendeth for superiority in strength with<br>\
this religion, and withstandeth it, or opposeth it,<br>\

one shall contend for superiority in strength with<br>\
religion, &amp;c. but he will be overcome by the religion. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\

فِيهِ ↓ شَادَّ; for] المُشَادَّةُ فِى الشَّىْءِ and التَّشَدُّدُ فِيهِ<br>\
signify the same: (S, L, K: * [see an ex. of<br>\
تشدّد in the first paragraph of art. جلد:]) [and]<br>\
both of these phrases signify the showing hardness,<br>\
&amp;c., in the thing. (PS.) You say also تشدّد لِلْأَمْرِ<br>\

thirty years: (Mgh:) or the age of forty years;<br>\
as in the Kur xlvi. 14: (L:) أَشُدٌّ [originally<br>\
أَشْدُدٌ] is a sing. having a pl. form, like آنُكٌ; and<br>\
these two words are [said to be] the only instances<br>\
of the kind: (S, K: [but see آنُكٌ:]) or a pl.<br>\
having no proper sing., (S, Mgh, K,) like<br>\
آسَالٌ and أَبَابِيلُ and عَبَادِيدُ and مَذَاكِيرُ: (S:) or<br>\
its sing. is ↓ شِدَّةٌ, (AHeyth, S, Mgh, K,) accord.<br>\
to Sb; and this is good with respect to the meaning, because one says, بَلَغَ الغُلَامُ شِدَّتَهُ; (S;) but<br>\
فِعْلَةٌ does not form a pl. of the measure أَفْعُلٌ;<br>\
(S, K;) for as to أَنْعُمٌ, (S,) which is said by<br>\
AHeyth to be pl. of نِعْمَةٌ, (TA,) [and respecting which Mtr says that] أَشُدٌّ is said to be pl.<br>\
of شِدَّةٌ like as أَنْعُمٌ is of نِعْمَةٌ, formed by regarding the ة as elided, (Mgh, [and AHeyth says the<br>\
like,]) it is only pl. of نُعْمٌ in the phrase يَوْمُ نُعْمٍ:<br>\
(S:) or its sing. is شَدٌّ, like as كَلْبٌ is of أَكْلُبٌ;<br>\
or شِدٌّ, like as ذِئْبٌ is of أَذْؤُبٌ; (S, K;) accord.<br>\
to some; (S;) but neither شَدٌّ nor شِدٌّ has been<br>\
heard from the Arabs [as sing. of أَشُدٌّ]; and they<br>\
are only deduced from analogy: (S, K:) or it is<br>\
pl. of أَشَدُّ; and the أ is not regarded in the formation of this pl. (IJ, from A &#39;Obeyd.)<br>\
مَشَدُّ العِصَابَةِ [The place, or part, where the<br>\
fillet, or the like, is bound, or tied]. (A.)<br>\
مُشِدٌّ A man having, (A, Mgh, L,) or having<br>\
with him, (L,) a strong beast, (A, Mgh, L,) or strong<br>\
beasts; (L;) contr. of مُضْعِفٌ. (Mgh, L.) It is<br>\
said in a trad., يَرُدُّ مُشِدُّهُمْ عَلَى مُضْعِفِهِمْ [He<br>\
among them who has a strong beast, or strong<br>\
beasts, shall give back a portion of the spoil to him<br>\
of them who has a weak beast, or weak beasts];<br>\
meaning that the strong warrior and plunderer<br>\
shall share with (يُسَاهِمُ) the weak in the plunder<br>\
that he gains. (L.)<br>\
مُتَشَدِّدٌ: see شَدِيدٌ.<br>\
