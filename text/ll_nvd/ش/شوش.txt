شوّش عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرَ, inf. n. تَشْوِيشٌ, He rendered the affair, or state, or case, confused, disordered, or perplexed, to him: (El-Fárábee, S, *<br>\
Msb: the inf. n., and that only, mentioned in the<br>\
S in art. شيش:) or, accord. to certain of those<br>\
skilled in the abstrusities and niceties of science,<br>\
شوّش is a post-classical word, and the chaste word<br>\
is هَوَّشَ: accord. to IAmb, the leading lexicologists hold that one should only say هوّش; and<br>\
Az and others say the same: (Msb:) [F also<br>\
says,] تَشْوِيشٌ is a mistake for تَهْوِيشٌ. (K.) See<br>\
also شَوَاشٍ.<br>\

تشوّش عَلَيْهِ الأَمْرُ The affair, or state, or<br>\
case, became confused, or perplexed, to him: (ElFárábee, S, Msb: mentioned in the S in art.<br>\
شيش:) or this is post-classical: (Msb:) or تَشَوُّشٌ<br>\
is a mistake for تَهَوُّشٌ. (K.)<br>\

تشاوش القَوْمُ The people, or company of<br>\
men, became mixed, or confounded, together; syn.<br>\
تَهَاوَشَ. (Sgh, K. *)<br>\
شَوشٌ in the phrase أَبْطَالٌ شُوشٌ i. q. شُوسٌ [pl.<br>\
of أَشْوَسُ, q. v.]. (O, K.)<br>\
شَوْشَآءُ and شَوْشَاةٌ, (Lth, O, K,) or the former is<br>\
a mistake, (TA,) the latter said by Az to be that<br>\
which he heard from the Arabs, (O, TA,) applied<br>\
to a she-camel, Light, or agile: (Lth, O, K:) or,<br>\
so applied, swift: (A&#39;Obeyd, O:) and applied to<br>\
a woman as an epithet of discommendation. (O.)<br>\
A poet, cited by AA, applies the epithet ↓ شَوَاشِئ,<br>\
with hemz, by poetic license, to a نَاضِح [properly<br>\
meaning a camel upon which water is drawn from<br>\
a well]; originally from شَوْشَآءُ, (O,) or شَوْشَاةٌ,<br>\
(TA,) meaning “ Light,” or “ agile,” applied to<br>\
a she-camel: so says AA. (O, TA.)<br>\
بَيْنَهُمْ شَوَاشٍ, (O, and so in the TA as from the<br>\
K,) or شَوَاشٌ, (so in the CK and in my MS.<br>\
copy of the K,) Between them is disagreement,<br>\
dissension, discord, or difference: (O, K:) the<br>\
vulgar say ↓ تَشْوِيشٌ. (O, TA.)<br>\
شَوَاشِئ: see شَوْشَآءُ.<br>\
مَشُوشٌ, (so accord. to my copy of the KL,) or<br>\
مِشْوَشٌ, (so accord. to Golius from the KL,) A<br>\
small turban (دَسْتَارْچَهْ). (KL. [Comp. مِشْوَذٌ.])<br>\
مُشَاوِشٌ Water not to be seen, (K,) or hardly to<br>\
be seen, (TA,) by reason of its remoteness [from<br>\
the surface of the ground] or its paucity: (K:) a<br>\
dial. var. of مُشَاوِسٌ [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
