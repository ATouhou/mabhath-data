(O, K,) I polished it; (S, O, K;) namely, a<br>\
thing, (S, O,) or an ornament of gold or silver.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] شِيفَتِ الجَارِيَةُ, (S, O, K,)<br>\

used in the present day as meaning He saw, and<br>\
he looked at, a thing.]<br>\

plain country and its freedom from those whom<br>\
they feared, in order that they might repair to<br>\
the water and the pasturage. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
تشوّف لِكَذَا He (a man) raised, or stretched and<br>\
raised, his eyes, or sight, towards such a thing:<br>\

and looked, and overlooked, or looked down, from<br>\
