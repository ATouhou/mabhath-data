دَنَأَ, aor.<br>\
دَنَاَ; and دَنُؤَ, aor.<br>\
دَنُاَ; inf. n. دَنَآءَةٌ,<br>\
(AZ, Lh, T, S, M, Msb, K,) of the former verb,<br>\
and of the latter also, (AZ, Lh, T, M,) and دُنُوْءٌ,<br>\
of the former, (Fr, T,) or of the latter, (AZ, T,)<br>\
and [of the latter] دُنُوْءَةٌ; (S, K;) He (a man)<br>\
was, or became, low, ignoble, or mean, in his<br>\
actions; and cared not for what he did, nor for<br>\
what was said to him: (ISk and T in explanation<br>\
of the former verb, and S in explanation of both<br>\
verbs:) or the former verb, (AZ, T,) or each,<br>\
(Lh, T, M, K,) he was, or became, bad, corrupt,<br>\
or foul, in respect of the belly and the genital<br>\
member [i. e. in respect of appetite for food and<br>\
for sexual enjoyment]; not caring for what he<br>\
did, nor for what was said to him: (AZ, Lh, T,<br>\
M, K:) and the former verb, (S) or each, (M,<br>\
K,) [accord. to some,] he was, or became, such as<br>\
is termed دَنِىْءٌ, i. e. خَسِيسٌ [app. as meaning<br>\
contemptible]; (S, M, K;) like دَنَا, aor. يَدْنُو,<br>\
inf. n. دَنَاوَةٌ; (Msb;) and destitute of good:<br>\
(S:) but some make a distinction between the<br>\
verbs with ء and the verb without ء; saying that<br>\
the meaning “ he was, or became, خسيس ” is that<br>\
of دنا, without ء; (T, Msb;) and the truth is,<br>\
that the verbs with ء have the meanings assigned<br>\
to them by AZ and Lh; (T;) or signify he was,<br>\
or became, low, ignoble, or mean: (Msb:) or<br>\
these two verbs also signify, (K,) or signify as<br>\
some say, (M,) he was one in whom was little or<br>\
no good; contemned or contemptible, mean,<br>\
paltry, or of no weight or worth. (M, K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
دَنِئَ, (M, K,) aor.<br>\
دَنَاَ, (K,) inf. n. دَنَأْ, (S, M,)<br>\
He was, or became, hump-backed. (S, M, K. *)<br>\
4<br>\
ادنأ He committed an action such as is<br>\
termed دَنِىْءَ. (M, K. *)<br>\
5<br>\
تدنّأهُ He, or it, incited him to دَنَآءَة [i. e.<br>\

دَنُؤَ, of which دَنَآءَة is an inf. n.]. (K.)<br>\
دَنِىْءٌ (AZ, Lh, T, S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ دَانِئٌ,<br>\
(Lh, T, S, * M, K,) applied to a man, Low,<br>\
ignoble, or mean, in his actions; not caring for<br>\
what he does, nor for what is said to him:<br>\
(S:) or bad, corrupt, or foul, in respect of the<br>\
belly and the genital member [i. e. in respect of<br>\
appetite for food and for sexual enjoyment]; not<br>\
caring for what he does, nor for what is said to<br>\
him: (AZ, Lh, T, M, K:) and [accord. to some,]<br>\
i. q. خَسِيسٌ [app. as meaning contemptible]; (S,<br>\
M, K;) like دَنِىٌّ, without ء; (Msb;) and destitute of good: (S:) but some make a distinction<br>\
between دَنِىْءٌ and دَنِىٌّ; saying that the latter<br>\
means خسيس; (T, Msb;) and the former, as<br>\
explained by AZ and Lh; and this is the truth;<br>\
(T;) or that دَنِىْءٌ means لَئِيمٌ [i. e. low, ignoble,<br>\
or mean, as contr. of كَرِيمٌ]: (Msb:) دَنِىْءٌ is<br>\
also applied to an action: (M, K: * [see 4:]) and<br>\
signifies likewise, (K,) or as some say, and so<br>\
↓ دَانِئٌ, (M,) one in whom is little or no good;<br>\
contemned or contemptible, mean, paltry, or of<br>\
no weight or worth: (M, K:) the pl. of دَنِىْءٌ is<br>\
أَدْنِيَآءُ, (AZ, T, M,) or أَدْنِئَآءُ, (Lh, T, TA,) or<br>\
أَدْنَآءٌ, (K, TA,) like أَشْرَافٌ pl. of شَرِيفٌ, (TA,)<br>\
and دُنَآءٌ, (K,) which is anomalous, (TA,) or<br>\
دُنَأءُ. (M.)<br>\
دَنِيْئَةٌ A low, or base, quality, property, natural<br>\
disposition, habit, practice, or action; syn. نَقِيصَةٌ;<br>\
(S, K;) or such as is blamed; also pronounced<br>\
دَنِيَّةٌ. (TA in art. دنو, q. v.)<br>\
دَانِئٌ: see دَنِىْءٌ, in two places.<br>\
أَدْنَأُ [More, and most, low, ignoble, or mean,<br>\
in his actions; &amp;c.]. You say, هُوَ أَدْنَأُ مِنْهُ [He<br>\
is more low, &amp;c., than he]. (Zj, T.) Fr says<br>\
that أَدْنَى in the Kur ii. 58 is [for أَدْنَأُ,] derived<br>\
from دَنَآءَةٌ: accord. to one reading, it is أَدْنَأُ.<br>\
