woman in the time of the menses puts into her<br>\
vulva, (K, TA,) to see if there be any remains of<br>\
the blood: (MF:) likened to the درجة of a she-camel. (K.) It is said in a trad. of &#39;Áïsheh,<br>\
كُنَّ يَبْعَثْنَ بِاالدَّرَجَةِ فِيهَا الكُرْسُفُ [They (women)<br>\
used to send the درجة, with cotton therein]:<br>\
(IAth, K, * TA:) but accord. to one reading it<br>\
is دِرَجَة, (IAth, K,) pl. of دُرْجٌ [explained above],<br>\
meaning “ a thing like a small سَفَط, in which a<br>\
woman puts her light articles and her perfumes: ”<br>\
(IAth:) El-Bájee read دَرَجَة, which seems to be<br>\
a mistake. (K.) ―<br>\

And see what here next follows.<br>\
دَرَجَةٌ A single stair, or step, of a series of stairs<br>\
or of a ladder; one of the دَرَج of a سُلَّم: (Mgh:)<br>\
and hence, by a synecdoche, (Mgh,) a series of<br>\
stairs, or a ladder, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,) constructed of wood or of clay [&amp;c.] against a wall<br>\
or the like, (Mgh,) by which one ascends to the<br>\
roof of a house; (TA;) as also ↓ دُرَجَةٌ (S, K)<br>\
and ↓ دُرْجَةٌ and ↓ دُرَجَّةٌ and ↓ أَدْرُجَّةٌ: (K:) the<br>\
pl. of the first is ↓ دَرَجٌ, (S,) or [rather] دَرَجَةٌ [has<br>\
for its proper pl. دَرَجَاتٌ, and] is n. un. of دَرَجٌ<br>\
like as قَصَبَةٌ is of قَصَبٌ. (Msb.) ↓ دَرَجٌ and<br>\
دَرَجَاتٌ also signify Stages upwards: opposed to<br>\
دَرَكٌ and دَرَكَاتٌ: and hence دَرَجَاتٌ is used in relation to Paradise; and دَرَكَاتٌ, in relation to<br>\
Hell. (B voce دَرَكٌ, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A degree in progress and the like: you say دَرَجَةً دَرَجَةً By<br>\

certain bird, (ISk, S, K,) of which the inside of<br>\
the wings is black, and the outside thereof dustcoloured; in form like the قَطَا, but smaller, or<br>\
more slender: (ISk, S:) thought by IDrd to be<br>\
the same as the دُرَّاج. (TA.) [See also دَرَّاجَةٌ,<br>\
last sentence.]<br>\
دُرَجَّةٌ: see دَرَجَةٌ.<br>\
رِيحٌ دَرُوجٌ A wind swift in its course: (S, K:)<br>\

ريح دروج signifies a wind of which the latter<br>\
part leaves marks (يَدْرُجُ) so as to produce what<br>\
resembles [the track made by the trailing of] the<br>\

(TA.)<br>\
دُرَّاجٌ A certain bird, (S, K,) [the attagen,<br>\
francolin, heath-cock, or rail,] resembling the<br>\
حَيْقُطَان, and of the birds of El-&#39;Irák, marked<br>\
with black and white spots, or, accord. to the T,<br>\
spotted: IDrd says, I think it is a post-classical<br>\
word; and it is the same as the دُرَجَة and دُرَّجَة:<br>\
in the S it is said that the names دُرَّاجٌ and ↓ دُرَّاجَةٌ<br>\
are applied to the male and the female [respectively] until one says حَيْقُطَان, which is applied<br>\
peculiarly to the male. (TA.) [See also De<br>\
Sacy&#39;s “ Chrest. Ar. ” 2nd ed. ii. 39.]<br>\

made for the purpose of besieging, beneath which<br>\
men enter. (K.) [The first and last of these significations are also assigned by Golius and Freytag to دُرَجَةٌ: but for this I find no authority;<br>\
although, after the latter of them, Golius indicates the authority of the S and K; and Freytag,<br>\
that of the K.]<br>\
