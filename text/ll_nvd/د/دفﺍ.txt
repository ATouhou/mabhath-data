دَفَئِىٌّ, (T, S, M, K,) also termed دَثَئِىٌّ, (As,<br>\
IAar, S, K,) but this latter is not of established<br>\

on the 11th of February O. S.,) when the sharpness of winter is broken, and the trees put forth<br>\
their leaves: see also 1 in art. نتج]: (Lth, IAar,<br>\
Th, M:) or the rain that is after [that called]<br>\
the رَبِيع[q.v.], before, (قَبْل, as in one copy of<br>\
the S, in another قبل without any syll. signs,)<br>\
or in the first part of, (قُبُل, as in the TA,) [that<br>\
called] the صَيْف[q. v., see also نَوْءٌ], when<br>\
the كَمْأَة disappear entirely from the earth:<br>\
(S, O, TA:) AZ says that the beginning of the<br>\
دَفَئِىّ is وُقُوعُ الجَبْهَةِ and the end is الصّرْفَةُ [i. e.<br>\
the period extends from the auroral setting of<br>\
the Tenth Mansion of the Moon (about the 11th<br>\
of February O. S. as explained above, when the<br>\
sun in Arabia has begun to have much power,)<br>\
to about the 9th of March O. S.: see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ,<br>\
in art. نزل; and see also another statement voce<br>\
نَوْءٌ]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\

as a subst., or as an epithet in which the quality<br>\
of a subst. is predominant, for مِيرَةٌ دَفَئِيَّةٌ,] is<br>\

syll. signs in a copy of the S, and قبلَ in the<br>\
CK,) or in the first part of, (قُبُل, as in the M<br>\
and TA and in a copy of the S and in one of the<br>\
K, [and this appears to be the right reading,] in<br>\
a copy of the T قِبل,) the صَيْف [here meaning<br>\
spring]: (AZ, T, S, M, K:) this is the third<br>\
ميرة; [see this word for an explanation of the<br>\
statement here given;] the first being that called<br>\
the رِبْعِيَّة[q. v.]; and the second, that called the<br>\
صَيْفِيَّة[q. v.]: then comes the دفئيّة; and then,<br>\
the رَمَضِيَّة, which comes when the earth becomes<br>\
burnt [by the sun]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And in like manner<br>\
also, (AZ, S,) i. e., by the term دَفَئِىٌّ is also<br>\
meant, (M,) The نِتَاج [or offspring] (AZ, S, M)<br>\
of sheep or goats [brought forth at that period,<br>\
as is implied in the S, or] in the end of winter:<br>\
