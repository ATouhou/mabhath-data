دَمَغَةٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
دَمَغَ (IDrd,<br>\
Msb, K) and<br>\
دَمُغَ, (IDrd, K,) inf. n. دَمْغٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) He broke his head so that the wound<br>\
reached the دِمَاغ [or brain]: (S, K:) or he broke<br>\
the bone of his دِمَاغ: (Msb:) or he struck it,<br>\
namely, a person&#39;s head, so that the stroke reached<br>\
to the دِمَاغ: (Mgh:) and he struck his دِمَاغ,<br>\
(K, TA,) and broke the interior of the skull,<br>\
next the دِمَاغ. (TA.) And دَمَغَتْهُ الشَّمْسُ The<br>\
sun pained his دِمَاغ. (IDrd, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, inf. n.<br>\
as above, (tropical:)  He overcame, or subdued, and abased,<br>\
him, or it: like as the truth does falsehood: and<br>\
hence فَيَدْمَغَهُ in the Kur [xxi. 18], meaning (tropical:)  so<br>\
that it may overcome it, or prevail over it, and<br>\
abolish it: or, accord. to Az, so that it may do<br>\
away with it, in such a manner as to render it<br>\
despicable, or ignominious. (TA.) And ↓ دمّغهُ<br>\
signifies (tropical:)  He overcame him, or prevailed over<br>\
him, much, so as to subdue him, or abase him.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, app.,] دُمِغَتِ الأَرْضُ (assumed tropical:)  [The<br>\
produce of] the land was eaten. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And دَمَغَهُمْ بِمُطْفَئَةِ الرَّضْفِ (tropical:)  He slaughtered<br>\
for them a lean sheep or goat: (K:) so says<br>\
Lh, except that he does not explain the verb,<br>\
which is thus explained by Ibn-&#39;Abbád and Z:<br>\
(TA:) or, as some say, a fat sheep or goat. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  دمغت حَوِيَّتَهَا, [the verb written in the L and<br>\
TA without teshdeed, so that it is app. دَمَغَتْ,<br>\
but it may be ↓ دَمَّغَتْ,] She (a woman) made, or<br>\
put, a دَامِغَة [q. v.] to her حويّة [or stuffed thing<br>\
whereon she rode upon her camel]. (ISh, L, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
دمّغ, inf. n. تَدْمِيغٌ, (tropical:)  He made a ثَرِيدَة [or<br>\
mess of crumbled, or broken, bread,] soft with<br>\
grease, or gravy. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also 1, in two places.<br>\
الدِّمَاغُ a word of which the signification is well<br>\
known; (S, Msb;) [The brain;] the marrow of<br>\
the head; (K;) or the stuffing of the head:<br>\
(TA:) or [app. a mistake for “and” (what<br>\
is termed)] أُمُّ الهَامِ or أُمُّ الرَّأْسِ or [in one<br>\
copy of the K “and”] أُمُّ الدِّمَاغِ is a thin<br>\
skin, like a pouch, in which it is contained: (K:)<br>\
[these three terms, امّ الهام and امّ الرأس and امّ<br>\
الدماغ, appear all to signify the meninx; (see أُمٌّ;)<br>\
but the first and second of them seem to have<br>\
been mistaken by the author or transcribers of the<br>\
K for different explanations of الدَّمَاغُ:] the pl.<br>\
[of pauc.] is أَدْمِغَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and [of mult.]<br>\
دُمُغٌ. (TA.)<br>\
دَمِيغٌ and ↓ مَدْمُوغٌ Having his head broken so<br>\
that the wound reaches the دِمَاغ [or brain]:<br>\
(IDrd, K:) the former is likewise applied to a<br>\
woman: and the pl., applied to men and to<br>\
women, is دَمْغَى. (IDrd, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, both<br>\
words, (assumed tropical:)  Stupid; foolish; or unsound, or dull, or<br>\
deficient, in intellect: ↓ مُدَمَّغٌ is incorrectly used<br>\
by the vulgar in this sense; (K, TA;) as though<br>\
meaning overcome, so as to be subdued, or abased,<br>\
by the devil: it is said in the “Námoos” that<br>\
this last word may be correct as having an intensive signification; but it may admit of such a<br>\
signification, and yet may be incorrect, not heard<br>\
from persons of chaste speech. (TA.)<br>\
دَامِغَةٌ A wound in the head, reaching the دِمَاغ<br>\
[or brain]; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) with which there<br>\
is no living: (Msb:) it is the last [in degree] of<br>\
[the wounds termed] شِجَاج [pl. of شَجَّةٌ]; these<br>\
being ten, as follows: [1] قَاشِرَةٌ, also called حَارِصَةٌ<br>\
(S, K, TA) and حَرْصَةٌ, or, as some think, the<br>\
حارصة or حرصة is different from the قاشرة: (TA:)<br>\
[2] بَاضِعَةٌ: [3] دَامِيَةٌ: [4] مُتَلَاحِمَةٌ: [5] سِمْحَاقٌ:<br>\
[6] مُوضِحَةٌ: [7] هَاشِمَةٌ: [8] مُنَقَّلَةٌ: [9] آمَّةٌ, (S,<br>\
K, TA,) also termed مَأْمُومَةٌ: (TA:) [10] دَامِغَةٌ:<br>\
(S, K, TA:) and A&#39;Obeyd adds دَامِعَةٌ, with the<br>\
unpointed ع, after دَامِيَةٌ; (S;) or, accord. to F,<br>\
who pronounces J to have erred in saying thus,<br>\
before دامية: but J is right in this case. (TA.)<br>\
[See شَجَّةٌ دَامِعَةٌ, voce دَامِعٌ. Several other terms<br>\
are mentioned in the TA; but these, which will<br>\
be found in their proper arts., appear to be all<br>\
syn. with some that are mentioned above. See<br>\
also شَجَّةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A spadix (طَلْعَةٌ) that comes<br>\
forth from amid the broken portions of the قُلْب<br>\
[or heart of the palm-tree], long and hard, and,<br>\
if left, mars the palm-tree; (S, K, * TA;) wherefore, when its existence is known, it is detached.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And An iron above the مُؤَخَّرَة [or<br>\
hinder part] of the [camel&#39;s saddle called] رَحْل;<br>\
(As, K;) also called غَاشِيَةٌ: (TA:) or an iron<br>\
with which the back of the رحْل is fastened:<br>\
(JK:) the pl. is دَوَامِغُ: ISh says that the دوامغ<br>\
are above the middle of the heads, or upper extremities, of the [curved pieces of wood called]<br>\
أَحْنَآء [pl. of حِنْوٌ]; and sometimes they are of<br>\
wood, firmly bound; and i. q. خَذَارِيفُ, pl. of<br>\
خُذْرُوفٌ [q. v.]: [but] Az says that when the<br>\
دامغة is of iron, it is placed across, or athwart,<br>\
above the two extremities of the حِنْوَانِ, and<br>\
nailed with two nails, the خذاريف being fastened<br>\
upon the heads of the cross-pieces, in order that<br>\
it, or they, may not become disconnected. (TA.)<br>\
[What it is, I am unable further to explain. It<br>\
is perhaps thus called because so placed that a<br>\
person is liable to have his head wounded by it.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And A piece of wood placed across between<br>\
two poles, upon which is hung the skin for water<br>\
or milk. (JK, Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
دَامُوغٌ One that wounds so as to reach the دِمَاغٌ<br>\
[or brain]; and that breaks the head or the like.<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.) And حَجَرٌ دَامُوغَةٌ A stone<br>\
that does so much, or vehemently: the ة denoting<br>\
intensiveness of signification. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
