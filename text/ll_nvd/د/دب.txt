دُبَّ and شُبَّ are used as nouns, by the introduction of مِنْ before them, though originally<br>\
verbs. (S and K * and TA in art. شب.) One<br>\

Kr, who assigns to it the former meaning, and<br>\
says that ↓ دَبَّةٌ is syn. with زَغَبٌ, not that it is<br>\
syn. with زَغَبَةٌ: (M:) or دَبَبٌ signifies hair upon<br>\

bull is a year old, and weaned, he is thus called;<br>\
and the female, دَبَبَةٌ, and دبان. (TA in art. شب.<br>\
[But for “ and دبان,” I think it evident that we<br>\
should read “ and the pl. is دُبَّانٌ,” or “ دِبَّانٌ,”<br>\
like as جُذْعَانٌ and جِذْعَانٌ are pls. of جَذَعٌ. See<br>\
also شَبَبٌ.])<br>\

دُبَّآءٌ and ↓ دَبَّةٌ The gourd: (M, K:) or round<br>\

Hajar to be a mistake of En-Nawawee; and he<br>\
asserts it to be i. q. يَقْطِينٌ [q. v.]: or it is the<br>\
fruit of the يقطين: (TA:) n. un. of the former<br>\
with ة. (M, K.) Accord. to F [and ISd] and<br>\
several others, this is the proper art. of the former<br>\
word, the ء being considered by them augmentative: accord. to Z and others, its proper art. is<br>\
دبى: and some also allow its being written and<br>\
pronounced دُبًّى: this is mentioned by Kz and<br>\
&#39;Iyád as a dial. var. of دُبَّآء. (TA.) [See an ex.<br>\
voce رِشَآءٌ, in art. رشو.]<br>\
مَا بِالدَّارِ دُبِّىٌّ and دِبِّىٌّ There is not in the<br>\
house any one: (S, M, * K:) دُبِّىٌّ being from<br>\
دَبَبْتُ; i. e. مَنْ يَدِبُّ; and it is not used in any<br>\
but a negative phrase. (Ks, S.) [See also دِبِّيجٌ<br>\
and دِبِّيحٌ.]<br>\
دُبَّآءَةٌ A locust while smooth and bare, before<br>\

what is thrown upon them from above: (TA:)<br>\
it is also called ضَبْرٌ. (Mgh.)<br>\
دَبْدَبٌ The walk of the long-legged ant. (M,<br>\

motion, or pace, performed with short steps:<br>\

(T.)<br>\

-b2-  And A bulky, or corpulent, man. (K.)<br>\
دَابَّةٌ [originally a fem. part. n.], for نَفْسٌ دَابَّةٌ,<br>\
(M,) [or the ة is added لِلنَّقْلِ, i. e. for the purpose of transferring the word from the category<br>\
of epithets to that of substs.,] Anything that<br>\
walks [or creeps or crawls] upon the earth; as<br>\
also ↓ دَبِيبٌ: (S: see دِبَّةٌ:) an animal that walks<br>\
or creeps or crawls (يَدِبُّ); (M, A, K;) discriminating and not discriminating: (M:) any<br>\
animal upon the earth: (Msb:) it is said in the<br>\
Kur [xxiv. 44], وَاللّٰهُ خَلَقَ كُلَّ دَابَّةٍ مِنْ مَآءٍ فَمِنْهُمْ<br>\
مَنْ يَمْشِى عَلَى بَطْنِهِ وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَمْشِى عَلَى رِجْلَيْنِ<br>\
وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَمْشِى عَلَى أَرْبَعٍ [And God hath<br>\
created every دابّة of water (meaning of the<br>\
seminal fluid); and of them is he that goeth upon<br>\
his belly, and of them is he that goeth upon two<br>\
legs, and of them is he that goeth upon four]:<br>\
here, as دابّة applies to a rational and an irrational creature, the expression فمنهم is used; for<br>\
which, if it applied only to an irrational creature,<br>\
فَمِنْهَا or فَمِنْهُنَّ would be used: moreover, the expression من يمشى is used, though دابّة applies<br>\
originally to an irrational creature, [or rather a<br>\
beast, and a reptile,] because the different classes<br>\
of beings are spoken of collectively: (M:) and<br>\
this passage of the Kur refutes the assertion of<br>\
him who excludes the bird from the significations<br>\
of this word: (Msb:) in the last verse but one<br>\
of ch. xxxv. of the Kur, it is said to relate to<br>\
mankind and the jinn (or genii) and every rational being; or to have a general signification:<br>\
(M:) its predominant signification is a beast that<br>\
is ridden: (S, M, A, K:) especially a beast of<br>\
the equine kind; i. e. a horse, a mule, and an<br>\
ass: (Kull:) or particularly a بِرْذَوْن [meaning<br>\
hackney, or horse for ordinary use and for<br>\
journeying: (M:) but as particularly applied,<br>\
when used absolutely, to a horse and a mule, it is<br>\
an adventitious conventional term: (Msb:) it is<br>\
applied to a male and a female: (M, A, Msb,<br>\
K:) and is properly an epithet: (M:) pl. دَوَابُّ.<br>\
(Msb, TA.) The dim. [signifying Any small<br>\
animal that walks or creeps or crawls upon the<br>\
earth, a small beast, a small reptile or creeping<br>\
thing, a creeping insect, and any insect, and also<br>\
a mollusk, a shell-fish (as in an instance cited voce<br>\
مَحَارَةٌ in art. حور) and the like,] is ↓ دُوَيْبَّةٌ, (Zj,<br>\
T, Msb,) in which the ى is quiescent, but pronounced with إِشْمَام [i. e. a slight approximation<br>\
to the sound of kesr], as it is in every similar<br>\
case, in a dim. n., when followed by a doubled<br>\
letter: (Zj, T:) and ↓ دُوَابَّةٌ also has been heard,<br>\
with the ى changed into ا anomalously. (Msb;<br>\
and L in art. هد, on the authority of ISd.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
دَابَّةُ الأَرْضِ [The Beast of the Earth] is an appellation of one of the signs of the time of the<br>\
resurrection: (S, M, K:) or the first of those<br>\
signs. (K.) It is said to be a beast sixty cubits<br>\
in length, or height, with legs, and with fur<br>\
(وَبَر), and to be diverse in form, resembling a<br>\
number of different animals. (TA.) It will come<br>\
forth in Tihámeh, or between Es-Safà and ElMarweh, (M,) or at Mekkeh, from Jebel Es-<br>\
Safà, which will rend open for its egress, during<br>\
one of the nights when people are going to<br>\
Minè; or from the district of Et-Táïf; (K) or<br>\
from three places, three several times. (M, K.)<br>\
It will make, upon the face of the unbeliever, a<br>\
black mark; and upon the face of the believer, a<br>\
white mark: the unbeliever&#39;s mark will spread<br>\
until his whole face becomes black; and the<br>\
believer&#39;s, until his whole face becomes white:<br>\
then they will assemble at the table, and the<br>\
believer will be known from the unbeliever.<br>\
(M.) It is also said that it will have with it the<br>\
rod of Moses and the seal of Solomon: with the<br>\
former it will strike the believer; and with the<br>\
latter it will stamp the face of the unbeliever, impressing upon it “ This is an unbeliever. ” (K.)<br>\

أَدَبٌّ Having down (K, TA) upon the face:<br>\
(TA:) or having much hair: (M, K:) and<br>\
having much وَبَر [or fur]: (M:) it is applied to<br>\
a man: (M:) and to a camel, (M, K,) in the<br>\
second of these senses, (K, TA,) or in the third<br>\
sense, or as meaning having much fur upon the<br>\
face; (TA;) or i. q. أَزَبُّ: (M:) and occurs<br>\
in a trad. written أَدْبَب, (M, K,) to assimilate it<br>\
in measure to a preceding word, namely, حَوْءَب:<br>\
(M:) the fem. is دَبَّآءُ; with which ↓ دَبِبَةٌ is syn.;<br>\
(M, K;) signifying a woman having hair upon<br>\
her face: (TA:) or having much hair upon the<br>\
جَبِين [or part above the temple]. (M, TA.)<br>\
مَدِبٌّ and مَدَبٌّ The track, or course, of a<br>\
torrent, (S, M, K, *) and of ants: (S, K:) pl.<br>\
مَدَابُّ. (TA.) One says, of a sword, لَهُ أَثْرٌ كَأَنَّهُ<br>\
مَدَبُّ النَّمْلِ and مَدَابُّ الذَّرِّ [It has diversified<br>\
wavy marks like the track of ants and the tracks<br>\
of little ants]. (TA.) The subst. is with kesr;<br>\
and the inf. n., with fet-h; accord. to a rule constantly obtaining, (S, * K, * TA,) except in some<br>\
anomalous instances, (TA,) when the verb is of the<br>\
measure فَعَلَ (S, K, TA) or فَعِلَ, (TA,) and its<br>\
aor. is of the measure يَفْعِلُ. (S, K, TA.) [Here<br>\
it should be observed that مَجْرًى, given as the<br>\
explanation of مَدِبٌّ and مَدَبٌّ in the K, is both<br>\
an inf. n. and a n. of place and of time: but J<br>\
clearly explains both these words as above; and<br>\
F seems, in the K, to assign to them both the<br>\
same signification.]<br>\
أَرْضٌ مَدَبَّةٌ A land abounding with دِبَبَة [or<br>\

مُدَبَّبٌ, like مُعَظَّمٌ, (TA,) or مِدْبَبٌ, (so in a<br>\

دبادب (TA) [app. دَبَادِبَ, and if so it seems to mean<br>\
