دَرَأَهُ, aor.<br>\
دَرَاَ, (M, Msb, K,) inf. n. دَرْءٌ (S,<br>\
M, Mgh, Msb, K) and دَرْأَةٌ; (K;) and ↓ درّأهُ;<br>\
(M, TA; [or this latter has probably an intensive<br>\
signification;]) He pushed it, or thrust it; or<br>\
pushed it, or thrust it, away, or back; repelled<br>\
it; or averted it; syn. دَفَعَهُ; (S, * M, Mgh, *<br>\
Msb, K;) namely, a thing. (Msb.) Hence,<br>\
كَانَ بَيْنَ عُمَرَ وَمُعَاذِ بْنِ عَفْرَآءَ دَرْءٌ There was,<br>\
between &#39;Omar and Mo&#39;ádh Ibn-&#39;Afrà, a contending, and a mutual pushing or thrusting, &amp;c.<br>\
(Mgh.) And دَرَأَ عَنْهُمْ He repelled from them, or<br>\
defended them; as also دَرَهَ, which is formed by<br>\
substitution from the former, like هَرَاقَ from أَرَاقَ.<br>\
(S in art. دره.) And دَرَأَ عَنْهُ الحَدَّ He averted<br>\
(دَفَعَ) from him the prescribed castigation: (M,<br>\
Mgh:) or he deferred his prescribed castigation:<br>\
and in like manner the verb is used in relation to<br>\
other things. (AZ, T.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
اِدْرَؤُوا الحُدُودَ بِالشُّبُهَاتِ [Avert ye, or defer ye, the<br>\
prescribed castigations on account of dubious circumstances]. (ISk, M, TA.) And اِدْرَؤُوا الحُدُودَ<br>\
مَا اسْتَطَعْتُمْ [Avert ye, or defer ye, the prescribed<br>\
castigations as long as ye are able]. (S, form a<br>\
trad.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5. ―<br>\
-b3-  دَرَأَ عَنِ البَعِيرِ الحَقَبَ is<br>\
explained by Sh as meaning He pushed back the<br>\
kind girth of the camel: but AM says that the<br>\
correct meaning is, he spread the kind girth upon<br>\
the ground, and made the camel to lie down upon<br>\
it [in order that he might gird him]. (TA.)<br>\
[For] دَرَأَ signifies also He spread, or laid flat,<br>\
(K, TA,) a thing upon the ground. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
دَرَأَ الشَّىْءَ بِالشَّىْءَ He supported the thing by the<br>\
thing; made the. thing to be a support to the<br>\
thing. (TA.) [Hence,] دَرَأَ الحَائِطَ بِبِنَآءٍ He conjoined the wall with a structure [so as to support<br>\
the former by the latter]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  دَرَأَ بِحَجَرٍ<br>\
He cast a stone; like رَدَأَ. (TA.) You say,<br>\
دَرَأَهُ بِحَجَر and رَدَأَهُ بِهِ He cast a stone at him.<br>\
(M in art. ردأ.) ―<br>\
-b6-  دَرَأَ said of a torrent, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. دَرْءٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  It rushed, or poured forth<br>\
with vehemence; as also ↓ اندرأ. (K.) And<br>\
دَرَأَ الوَادِى بِالسَّيْلِ (assumed tropical:)  The valley poured along the<br>\
torrent. (TA.) [See also دَرْءٌ, below.] ―<br>\
-b7-  دَرَأَ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. دُرُوْءٌ, (TA,) is syn. with طَرَأَ [He<br>\
came from a place, or from a distant place, unexpectedly; &amp;c.]. (K.) And you say, دَرَأَ عَلَيْنَا<br>\
فُلَانٌ, (T, S, K, * TA,) inf. n. دُرُوْءٌ (S, TA) and<br>\
دَرْءٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اندرأ (S, TA) and ↓ تدرّأ; (TA;)<br>\
Such a one came, or came forth, upon us unexpectedly, (T, S, K, * TA,) or whence we knew not;<br>\
as also طَرَأَ, (T,) and دَرَهَ. (IAar, TA in art. دره.)<br>\
And عَلَيْهِ بِشَرٍّ ↓ اندرأ, vulg. اندرى, He came<br>\
upon him suddenly with evil, or mischief. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  Hence, i. e. from دَرَأَ signifying “ he came, or<br>\
came forth, unexpectedly,” (T, S, TA,) دَرَأَ, inf. n.<br>\
دُرُوْءٌ, said of a star, meaning (tropical:)  It shone, or glistened, (S, K, TA,) intensely, (S, TA,) and its<br>\
light spread: (TA:) or, as some say, it rose.<br>\
(T.) [Hence also,] دَرَأَتِ النَّارُ (assumed tropical:)  The fire gave<br>\
light, shone, was bright, or shone brightly.<br>\
(Sh, K.)<br>\
-A2-  دَرَأَ, (T, S, K,) aor.<br>\
دَرَاَ, (T,) inf. n.<br>\
دُرُوْءٌ, (T, S,) He (a camel) had what is termed<br>\
the غُدَّة, (S, K,) i. e. the plague, or pestilence,<br>\
(طَاعُون,) of camels, (T,) and had therewith a<br>\
tumour in his back, (S, K,) or in his نَحْر [or<br>\
stabbing-place, in the uppermost part of the<br>\
breast]: but in a female, it is in the udder:<br>\
(TA:) or had a tumour in his نَحْر. (IAar, T.)<br>\
The epithet applied to the male is ↓ دَارِئٌ: and so,<br>\
accord. to ISk, to the female, (T, S,) meaning<br>\
Attacked by the غُدَّة in her مَرَاق, (T, and so in a<br>\
copy of the S,) thus, without teshdeed to the ق,<br>\
signifying the part, of her throat, which is the<br>\
place of passage of the water, (T, TA,) or in her<br>\
مَرَاقّ [or thin and soft parts of the belly], (so in<br>\
one of my copies of the S,) so that the protuberance of the غُدَّة [or pestilential tumour] is<br>\
apparent: which protuberance is termed ↓ دَرْءٌ.<br>\
(T, S.)<br>\
2<br>\
دَرَّاَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
3<br>\
مُدَارَأَةٌ, primarily, (TA,) signifies The act of<br>\
opposing; and repelling, or striving to repel:<br>\
(S, TA:) or treating in an evil, or adverse,<br>\
manner; and opposing: (A &#39;Obeyd, TA:) or<br>\
the putting one off in the matter of a right or<br>\
due, by promising to render it time after time;<br>\
and treating in an evil, or adverse, and a contrary, manner. (Mgh in arts. درى and شرى.)<br>\
One says, دَرَأْتُهُ I repelled him, or strove to repel<br>\
him. (T, Msb, K.) And فُلَانٌ لَا يُدَارِئُ وَ لَا يُمَارِى,<br>\
(S, TA,) i. e. Such a one does not act in an evil,<br>\
or adverse, manner, nor oppose, [nor does he<br>\
wrangle, or dispute obstinately:] and لا يُدَارِى,<br>\
meaning, accord. to Sgh, if for لا يُدَارِئُ, does not<br>\
repel, or strive to repel, him who has a right<br>\
from his right. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to El-Ahmar,<br>\
in [the exercise of] good disposition, (T, S,) and<br>\
in social intercourse, (S,) it is with and without ء; (T, S;) contr. to the assertion of A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
who says that in this case it is without ء. (T.)<br>\
[F says,] دَارَأْتُهُ is syn. with دَارَيْتُهُ and دَافَعْتُهُ and<br>\
لَايَنْتُهُ [the second of which has a meaning explained above; the first and last meaning I<br>\
treated him with gentleness or blandishment,<br>\
soothed him, coaxed him, or wheedled him; &amp;c.];<br>\
thus bearing two contr. significations: (K:) [or]<br>\
دَرَأْتُهُ and دَارَيْتُهُ both signify I was fearful, or<br>\
cautious, of him; and treated him with gentleness or blandishment, or soothed him, coaxed him,<br>\
wheedled him, or cajoled him: (S:) [but Az<br>\
says,] I say that the verb with ء means I was<br>\
fearful, or cautious, of him, as says AZ; or of<br>\
his evil, or mischief: and دَارَيْتُ signifies “ I<br>\
deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or<br>\
outwitted; ” as also دَرَيْتُ. (T.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَدْرَأَتْ بِضَرْعِهَا, (AZ, T, S,) inf. n. إِدْرَآءٌ, (AZ,<br>\
T,) [as also اذرأت, with ذ,] She (a camel) excerned<br>\
(أَنْزَلَتْ) the milk, (AZ, T, S,) and relaxed her<br>\
udder, on the occasion of bringing forth. (AZ, S.)<br>\
The epithet applied to the she-camel so doing is<br>\
↓ مُدْرِئٌ. (AZ, T, S, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَدَرَّاَ see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  تدرّأ عَلَيْنَا He domineered over us.<br>\
(S.) And تدرّؤوا عَلَيْهِمْ They domineered over<br>\
them, (K, TA,) and aided one another against<br>\
them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  تدرّؤوا, (M, K, TA,) and ↓ اِدَّرَؤُوا<br>\
دَرِيْئَةً, (TA,) They concealed themselves from a<br>\
thing in order to beguile it, or circumvent it:<br>\
(M, K, TA:) or they made use of a ذَرِيعَة [or<br>\
دَرِيْئَة] for hunting and spearing or thrusting [or<br>\
shooting objects of the chase]: (TA:) and ↓ ادّرأتُ<br>\
لِلصَّيْدِ, (S,) or الصَّيْدِ, (K,) I prepared for myself a دَرِيئَة for the chase: (S, K:) and ↓ دَرَأَ<br>\
الدَّرِيْئَةَ لِلصَّيْدِ, aor.<br>\
دَرَاَ, inf. n. دَرْءٌ, He drove the<br>\
دريئة to the chase, and concealed himself by it.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
6<br>\
تدارؤوا They repelled, or strove to repel, one<br>\
another (M, Msb, K) in contention, or altercation, (M, K,) and the like; and disagreed. (M.)<br>\
اِدَّارَأْتُمْ is originally تَدَارَأْتُمْ, (S, K,) the ت being<br>\
incorporated into the د, (S, TA,) because they<br>\
have the same place of utterance, (TA,) and the ا<br>\
being added to commence the word: (S, TA:)<br>\
the meaning is, Ye disagreed; and repelled, or<br>\
strove to repel, one another. (S.) فَادَّارَأْتُمْ فِيهَا,<br>\
in the Kur ii. 67, means And ye contended together respecting it; because those who contend<br>\
repel one another: or ye repelled, or strove (??)<br>\
repel, one another, by each of you casting the<br>\
slaughter upon his fellow. (Bd.)<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْدَرَاَ see 1, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  The phrase الحُدُودُ<br>\
تَنْدَرِئُ بِالشُّبُهَاتِ [The prescribed castigations shall<br>\
be, or are to be, averted, or deferred, on account<br>\
of dubious circumstances,] is agreeable with<br>\
analogy, but has not been heard [from the Arabs<br>\
of classical times]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اندرأ الحَرِيقُ The<br>\
fire [of a burning house &amp;c.] spread, (K, TA,)<br>\
and gave light, shone, was bright, or shone<br>\
brightly. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِدْتَرَاَ see 5, in two places.<br>\
دَرْءٌ and inf. n. of 1 in senses pointed out above.<br>\
(S, M, &amp;c.) So of that verb said of a torrent.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence,] جَآئَ السَّيْلُ دَرْءًا and ↓ دُرْءًا The<br>\
torrent rushed, or poured forth with vehemence, [or<br>\
came rushing, &amp;c.,] from a place, (M, K,) or<br>\
from a distant place, (TA,) unknown: (M, K,<br>\
TA:) or the latter signifies the torrent came<br>\
from a distant land or tract. (S.) And جَآءَ<br>\
↓ الوَادِى دُرْءًا The valley flowed with the rain of<br>\
another valley: if with its own rain, you say,<br>\
سَالَ ظَهْرًا: (IAar, M; and the like is said in the<br>\
TA in the present art. and in art. ظهر:) or سال<br>\
دُرْءًا means it flowed with other than its own<br>\
rain; and ظَهْرًا, “with its own rain. ” (TA in<br>\
art. ظهر.) Hence ↓ الدُّرْءُ has been metaphorically<br>\
used by a rájiz to signify (tropical:)  The flowing of water<br>\
from the mouths of camels into their insides.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
-A2-  A bending; (TA;) a crookedness, or<br>\
curvity; (S, M, K, TA;) in a cane, or spearshaft, and the like; (M, K;) or in a staff, and<br>\
anything that is hard to straighten: (T, TA:)<br>\
pl. دُرُوْءٌ. (M.) One says, أَقَمْتُ دَرْءٌ فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  I<br>\
rectified the crookedness and opposition, or resistance, of such a one. (S.) And hence, بِئْرٌ ذَاتُ دَرْءٍ<br>\
A well having a part [of its shaft] projecting, or<br>\
protuberant. (S, O.) And طَرِيقٌ ذُو دُرُوْءٍ A road<br>\
having furrows, (M, * K, *) or abrupt, water-worn, ridges, (T, S, M,) and protuberances, and<br>\
the like. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The extremity, or edge, of a<br>\
thing; because it repels therewith. (Ham p. 213.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  A portion of a mountain that projects, or<br>\
juts out, from the rest, (M, K, TA, and Ham<br>\
p. 213 in explanation of the pl.,) unexpectedly:<br>\
(TA:) pl. as above. (M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 1, last<br>\
sentence. ―<br>\
-b5-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Disobedience, and resistance,<br>\
and hatred, or dislike, (T, TA,) and crookedness,<br>\
(T,) and disagreement, on the part of a wife.<br>\
(T, TA.)<br>\
دُرْءٌ: see دَرْءٌ, in three places.<br>\
دَرِيْئَةٌ A ring by aiming at which one learns to<br>\
pierce or thrust [with the spear] (S, M, K) and<br>\
to shoot: (T, * M, K:) said by As to be with ء:<br>\
(S:) and also called وَتِيرَةٌ. (S in art. وتر.) &#39;Amr<br>\
Ibn-Maadee-Kerib says,<br>\
ظَلِلْتُ كَأَنِّى لِلرِّمَاحِ دَرِيْئَةٌ<br>\
أُقَاتِلُ عَنْ أَبْنَآءَ جَرْمٍ وَفَرَّتِ<br>\
[I passed the day as though I were a ring for<br>\
the spears to be aimed at, fighting in defence of<br>\
the sons of Jarm, when they had fled]. (T, S,<br>\
M. [See also Ham p. 75, where it is written<br>\
دَرِيَّةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A camel, (T, S,) or other thing,<br>\
(S,) or anything, (M, K,) by which one conceals<br>\
himself (T, S, M, K) from the wild animals, (T,)<br>\
or from the objects of the chase, (S, * M, K,) in<br>\
order that they may be circumvented, (T, S, M,<br>\
K,) so that when the man is able to shoot, or<br>\
cast, he does so: (T, S:) like ذَرِيعَةٌ: (S in art.<br>\
ذرع:) accord. to AZ, it is with ء, (S,) because<br>\
the دريئة is driven (تُدْرَأُ, i. e. تُدْفَعُ,) towards the<br>\
objects of the chase: (T, * S:) but IAth says that<br>\
it is دَرِيَّةٌ, without ء; and that it signifies an<br>\
animal by means of which the sportsman conceals<br>\
himself, leaving it to pasture with the wild animals<br>\
until they have become familiar with it and so<br>\
rendered accessible to him, when he shoots, or<br>\
casts, at them: (TA:) the pl. of دَرِيْئَةٌ is دَرَايَا<br>\
and دَرَائئُ with two hemzehs, each of them extr.<br>\
[with respect to analogy]. (M, TA.)<br>\
دَرِّىْءٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
دُرِّىْءٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
كَوْكَبٌ دِرِّىْءٌ, (T, S, K, &amp;c.,) like خِمِّيرٌ and<br>\
سِكِّيرٌ (S) or سِكِّينٌ, (K,) from دَرَأَ عَلَيْنَا فُلَانٌ;<br>\
(S;) and ↓ دُرِّىْءٌ, (M, K,) the only instance of<br>\
the measure فُعِّيلٌ except مُرِّيقٌ; (K;) [which<br>\
latter word has been mistaken by Golius and<br>\
Freytag for a noun qualified by the epithet درّىء;]<br>\
but A&#39;Obeyd says that when it is pronounced<br>\
with the first letter madmoomeh it is دُرِّىٌّ, without ء, a rel. n. from دُرٌّ, of the measure فُعْلِىٌّ,<br>\
[and the like is said in the K, though دُرِّىْءٌ is also<br>\
there mentioned as correct,] because there is not<br>\
[to his knowledge] in the language of the Arabs<br>\
any word of the measure فُعِّيلٌ; and that he who<br>\
pronounces it [دُرِّىْءٌ] with ء means that it is<br>\
[originally of the measure] فُعُّولٌ, like سُبُّوحٌ, and<br>\
that one of its vowels is changed to kesr because<br>\
it is deemed difficult of pronunciation; and Akh<br>\
mentions also ↓ دَرِّىْءٌ, with ء, of the measure<br>\
فَعِّيلٌ, with fet-h to the first letter, (S, TA,) on<br>\
the authority of Katádeh and AA; (TA;) (tropical:)  A<br>\
star that shines, or glistens, (S, K, TA,) intensely:<br>\
(S:) or a star that is impelled in its course from<br>\
the east to the west: (M:) accord. to IAar, [a<br>\
shooting star;] a star that is impelled (يُدْرَأُ)<br>\
against the devil [or a devil; for the Arabs<br>\
believed, and still believe, that a shooting star is<br>\
one that is darted against a devil when he attempts<br>\
to hear by stealth the discourse of the angels in<br>\
the lowest heaven]: (T, TA:) and said by some<br>\
to signify one of the five planets: (TA in art.<br>\
در:) pl. دَرَارِىْءُ; (T, S, M;) said by Fr to be<br>\
applied by the Arabs to the great stars of which<br>\
the names are not known. (S.)<br>\
دَارِئٌ Coming from a place, or from a distant<br>\
place, unexpectedly: (M, TA: but only the pls.<br>\
of the word in this sense are there mentioned:)<br>\
an enemy showing open hostility, or coming forth<br>\
into the field to encounter another in battle: and<br>\
a stranger: (T:) pl. دُرَأءُ (T, M, TA) and دُرَّآءٌ.<br>\
(M, TA.) People say, نَحْنُ فُقَرَآءُ دُرَأءُ [We are<br>\
poor men, come from a distant place, or strangers]. (T, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] metaphorically used by Ru-beh as<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  Swollen with anger. (M, TA.)<br>\
السُّلْطَانُ ذُو تُدْرَأٍ, (S, M, * K,) and ↓ تُدْرَأَةٍ, (K,)<br>\
accord. to different relations of a trad. in which it<br>\
occurs, (TA,) The Sultán is possessed of apparatus [of war], (عُدَّة, S, and so in some copies of<br>\
the K,) or might, (عِزّ, so in other copies of the<br>\
K,) and power, to repel his enemies: (S, M, *<br>\
K: *) accord. to IAth, ذو تدرأ signifies impetuous,<br>\
not fearing or dreading; and so, having power to<br>\
repel his enemies: (TA:) it is used in relation to<br>\
war and contention. (M.) You say also, هُوَ ذُو<br>\
تُدْرَأٍ and تُدْرَهٍ: and هُوَ ذُو تُدْرَئِهِمْ and تُدْرَهَهِمْ<br>\
(TA in art. دره, q. v.)<br>\
تُدْرَأَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مُدْرِئٌ: see 4.<br>\
مِدْرَأٌ A thing with which one pushes, or thrusts;<br>\
or pushes, or thrusts, away, or back. (TA.)<br>\
[Applied in the present day, pronounced مِدْرَا,<br>\
without ء, to A boat-pole.]<br>\
ذَاتُ المِدْرَأَةِ The she-camel of violent spirit.<br>\
