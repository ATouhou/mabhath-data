دَخَلَ, (S, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
دَخُلَ, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
دُخُولٌ (S, Msb, K) and مَدْخَلٌ, (S, K,) He, or<br>\
it, entered; or went, came, passed, or got, in;<br>\
contr. of خَرَجَ; (K;) as also ↓ اِدَّخَلَ, of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ, and ↓ اندخل, (S, K,) this last occuring in poetry, but not chaste, (S,) and ↓ تدخّل,<br>\
(K,) or this signifies it (a thing) entered by little<br>\
and little. (S, O.) You say, دَخَلْتُ مَدْخَلًا حَسَنًا<br>\
[like دُخُولًا حَسَنًا I entered with a good entering].<br>\
(S.) And دَخَلْتُ البَيْتَ (S) or الدَّارَ, i. e. [I entered the house, or] I became within the house,<br>\
and the like, (Msb,) correctly meaning إِلَى البَيْتِ<br>\
[&amp;c., or فِى البَيْتِ &amp;c., i. e. I entered into the<br>\
house, &amp;c.], the prep. being suppressed, and the<br>\
noun put in the accus. case after the manner of<br>\
an objective complement: for nouns of place are<br>\
of two kinds, vague and definite; the vague being<br>\
such as the six relative locations, خَلْفٌ, and قُدَّامٌ,<br>\
and يَمِينٌ, and شِمَالٌ, and فَوْقٌ, and تَحْتٌ, and the<br>\
like, such as أَمَامٌ, and وَرَآءٌ, and أَعْلَى, and أَسْفَلُ,<br>\
and عِنْدَ, and لَدُنْ, and وَسْطٌ in the sense of بَيْنٌ,<br>\
and قُبَالَةٌ, all which, and similar nouns of place,<br>\
may become adverbs, because indefinite; for dost<br>\
thou not see that what is خَلْف to thee may be<br>\
قُدَّام to another? but that which is definite,<br>\
having make, and corporeal substance, and tracts<br>\
that comprehend it, as a mountain and a valley<br>\
and a market and a house and a mosque, the<br>\
noun signifying such a thing cannot become an<br>\
adverb; for you may not say, قَعَدْتُ الدَّارَ, nor<br>\
صَلَّيْتُ المَسْجِدَ, nor نِمْتُ الجَبَلَ, nor قُمْتُ الوَادِىَ;<br>\
the phrases of this kind that occur being instances<br>\
of the suppression of a prep.; as دَخَلْتُ البَيْتَ,<br>\
and نَزَلْتُ الوَادِىَ, and صَعِدْتُ الجَبَلَ. (S, O, TA.)<br>\
You say also, دَخَلْتُ عَلَى زَيْدٍ الدَّارَ, meaning I<br>\
entered the house after Zeyd, he being in it.<br>\
(Msb.) [And simply دَخَلَ عَلَيْهِ He came in<br>\
upon him: and also he came upon him; i. e. invaded him.] And دَخَلَ بِامْرَأَتِهِ, (Msb, TA,) and<br>\
عَلَيْهَا, (MA,) inf. n. دُخُولٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) [like<br>\
دَخَلَ بِأَهْلِهِ, and عَلَيْهَا, (see أَهْلٌ,) i. e. (tropical:)  He went<br>\
in to his wife or woman,] is a metonymical<br>\
phrase, denoting الجِمَاع, (Msb, TA,) i. e. الوَطْء,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, TA,) whether it be such as is allowed<br>\
by the law or such as is forbidden, (Mgh,) generally such as is lawful. (Msb, TA. [See what<br>\
is said in explanation of the term خَلْوَةٌ in the first<br>\
paragraph of art. خلو.]) And دَخَلَ بَعْضُهُ فِى<br>\
بَعْضٍ i. q. تَدَاخَلَ [q. v.]. (TA in art. قصر, &amp;c.)<br>\
[For ex.,] you say, دَخَلَ بَعْضُ النُّجُومِ فِى بَعْضٍ<br>\
[The stars became confused together]. (Mgh and<br>\
TA in art. شبك: in the former coupled with<br>\
اِخْتَلَطَتْ.) And دَخَلَ فِيهِمْ [He entered among<br>\
them, so as to become a member of their community, confraternity, party, sect, or the like;] said<br>\
of a stranger. (K.) [And دَخَلَ فِى طَاعَتِهِ: see<br>\
طَائِعٌ, in art. طوع.] When دَخَلَ is said of income, or revenue, [meaning It came in, accrued,<br>\
or was received,] the aor. is as above, and the<br>\
inf. n. دَخْلٌ: (Msb:) and you say, يَدْخُلُ عَلَى<br>\
الإِنْسَانِ [It comes in, or accrues, to the man].<br>\
(Msb, K. *) دَخَلَ بِهِ [lit. He entered with him,<br>\
or it]: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, دَخَلَ فِيهِ meaning (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
became included, comprehended, or comprised, in<br>\
it. And hence,] دَخَلَ فِى دِينِ الإِسْلَامِ (assumed tropical:)  [He<br>\
entered within the pale of the religion of ElIslám; he entered the communion of that religion; he entered into, embraced, or became a<br>\
proselyte to, that religion]. (Msb in art. سلم, &amp;c.<br>\
[See Kur cx. 2.]) And دَخَلَ فِى الأَمْرِ, inf. n.<br>\
دُخُولٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He entered upon, began, or commenced,<br>\
the affair. (Msb.) [And دَخَلَ فِى أَمْرِ غَيْرِهِ, and<br>\
أُمُورِ غَيْرِهِ, and ↓ تدخّل, and ↓ تداخل (assumed tropical:)  He entered<br>\
into, or mixed himself in, another&#39;s affair, and another&#39;s affairs.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also, دَخَلَ عَلَيْهِ said<br>\
of night, &amp;c., It came upon him, or invaded him.<br>\
And said of a word, such as a prep. &amp;c., It was,<br>\
or became, prefixed to it, preposed to it, or put<br>\
before it.] ―<br>\
-b4-  [دَخَلَنِى مِنْهُ seems (from an instance<br>\
in art. بضع in the K) to mean (assumed tropical:)  An evil opinion<br>\
of him entered my mind; from دَخْلٌ as signifying<br>\
“ a thing that induces doubt, or suspicion, or evil<br>\
opinion. ”]<br>\
-A2-  دُخِلَ, (S, K,) like عُنِىَ; (K;)<br>\
and دَخِلَ, aor.<br>\
دَخَلَ; inf. n. [of the former] دَخْلٌ<br>\
and [of the latter] دَخَلٌ; (K;) (assumed tropical:)  He had an unsoundness (دَخَلٌ, S, K, i. e. فَسَادٌ, K) in his intel-lect, (S, K,) or in his body, (K,) or in his grounds<br>\
of pretension to respect. (TA in explanation of<br>\
the former verb.) And دَخِلَ أَمْرُهُ, aor.<br>\
دَخَلَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. دَخَلٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  His affair, or case, or state,<br>\
was, or became, intrinsically bad or corrupt or<br>\
unsound. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  دُخِلَ الطَّعَامُ The corn, or food,<br>\
became eaten by worms or the like. (JK.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
دُخِلَ عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He was led into a mistake, or an<br>\
error, respecting a thing, without knowing it, by<br>\
his having preconceived it. (Msb.)<br>\
2<br>\
دخّل, inf. n. تَدْخِيلٌ, He put dates into a<br>\
دَوْخَلَّة [q. v.]. (TA.) [In the present day, دخّلهُ<br>\
is used in the first of the senses assigned below to<br>\
أَدْخَلَهُ; but for this I have not found any classical<br>\
authority.]<br>\
3<br>\
مُدَاخَلَةٌ [inf. n. of داخل] signifies The<br>\
entering [with another] into a place: or (assumed tropical:)  into<br>\
an affair. (KL.) You say, داخلهُ فِى أُمُورِهِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [He entered with him into, or mixed with him<br>\
in, his affairs]. (JK, S.) And دَاخَلَهُمْ [alone<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He entered with them into, or mixed with them<br>\
in, their affairs: he mixed with them in familiar,<br>\
or social, intercourse: he conversed with them;<br>\
or was, or became, intimate with them]. (Lh,<br>\
TA in the present art. and in art. خلط. [See 3<br>\
in art. خلط.]) And دَاخَلَهُ فَسَادٌ فِى عَقْلٍ أَوْ جِسْمٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Unsoundness in intellect, or body, infected him,<br>\
as though commingling with him; like خَالَطَهُ].<br>\
(K.) دِخَالٌ [also is an inf. n. of داخل]: see 6,<br>\
in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [See also دِخَالٌ below.]<br>\
4<br>\
ادخلهُ, inf. n. إِدْخَالٌ and مُدْخَلٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
He made, or caused, him, or it, to enter; or to<br>\
go, come, pass, or get, in; he put in, inserted,<br>\
brought in, or introduced, him, or it; as also<br>\
بِهِ ↓ دَخَلَ [lit. he entered with him, or it], (K,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. دُخُولٌ. (TA.) You say, أَدْخَلْتُ<br>\
زَيْدًا الدَّارَ, [for فِىالدَّارِ, I made, or caused,<br>\
Zeyd to enter the house, or I brought, or introduced, Zeyd into the house,] inf. n. مُدْخَلٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) Hence, in the Kur [xvii. 82], رَبِّ أَدْخَلْنِى<br>\
مُدْخَلَ صِدْقٍ (S, * TA) O my Lord, cause me to<br>\
enter El-Medeeneh in a good, or an agreeable,<br>\
manner: (Jel: [see also various similar explanations in Bd:]) [or ↓ مُدْخَل may be here a n.<br>\
of place, or of time: see, in art. خرج, what is<br>\
said of the words of the Kur that follow, أَخْرِجْنِى<br>\
مَخْرَجَ صِدْقٍ.] One says also, أَدْخَلْتُ الخُفَّ فِى<br>\
رِجْلِى and القَلَنْسُوَةَ فِى رَأْسِى [for أَدْخَلْتُ رِجْلِى فِى<br>\
الخُفِّ and رَأْسِى فِى القَلَنْسُوَةِ I put, or inserted,<br>\
my leg, or foot, into the boot and my head into<br>\
the cap]. (Ham p. 43.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the saying,<br>\
يُدْخِلُ عَلَى قَوْمِهِ مَكْرُوهًا يَلْطَخُهُمْ بِهِ [He brings<br>\
against his people an abominable, or evil, charge,<br>\
aspersing them with it]. (S in art. عر.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَدَخَّلَ see 1, first sentence: and again in the latter<br>\
half of the paragraph.<br>\
6<br>\
تداخل signifies دَخَلَ بَعْضُهُ فِى بَعْضٍ [One<br>\
part of it entered into another, or parts of it<br>\
into others; meaning it became intermixed, intermingled, commixed, or commingled; it intermixed; it became confused: and hence it often<br>\
means it became compact, or contracted]. (TA<br>\
in art. قصر.) [Hence,] تَدَاخَلٌ signifies The<br>\
entering of joints one into another; (M;) as<br>\
also ↓ دِخَالٌ (JK, M, K) and ↓ دَخِيلٌ; (K;) but<br>\
this last is not in the M [nor in the JK], and<br>\
requires consideration: (TA:) [perhaps the joints<br>\
(مَفَاصِل) here mentioned are those of a coat of<br>\
mail; for it is said immediately before in the<br>\
JK that دِخَالٌ in coats of mail signifies firmness,<br>\
or compactness, of make. Hence also,] تَدَاخُلُ<br>\
اللُّغَاتِ [The intermixture, or commixture, of<br>\
dialects]. (Mz 17th نوع.) And تَدَاخُلُ الأُمُورِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The dubiousness and confusedness of affairs;<br>\
as also الأُمُورِ ↓ دِخَالُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, in the<br>\
latter half of the paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  [It is also trans.]<br>\
You say, تَدَاخَلَنِ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ [Something thereof,<br>\
or therefrom, crept into me, i. e., into my mind].<br>\
(S, TA. [In the former, this meaning seems to be<br>\
indicated by what there immediately precedes.])<br>\
And تَدَاخَلَنِى مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ رَمَضٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Distress<br>\
and disquietude, or grief, crept into me from, or<br>\
in consequence of, this thing]. (A and TA in<br>\

-b2-  And He entered a<br>\
خَمَر [or covert of trees &amp;c., or some other place<br>\
of concealment]: said of one lurking to shoot, or<br>\
cast, at objects of the chase. (TA.)<br>\
دَخْلٌ Income, or revenue, or profit, that comes<br>\
in, or accrues, to a man from his immovable<br>\
property, such as land and houses and palm-trees<br>\
&amp;c., (T, Msb, K,) and from his merchandise;<br>\
(Msb;) contr. of خَرْجٌ; (S;) as also ↓ مَدْخُولٌ<br>\
[for مَدْخُولٌ بِهِ]: (TA:) the former is originally<br>\
an inf. n., of which the verb is دَخَلَ, aor.<br>\
دَخُلَ.<br>\
(Msb.) You say, دَخْلُهُ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ خَرْجِهِ [His<br>\
income is more than his outgoings, or expenditure]. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  See also دُخْلَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  A disease;<br>\
(K;) as also ↓ دَخَلٌ: (K, TA; but not decisively<br>\
shown to have this meaning in the CK:) a vice,<br>\
fault, defect, or blemish; (S, K;) and particularly in one&#39;s grounds of pretension to respect,<br>\
(Az, TA,) as also, thus restricted, ↓ دَخَلٌ: (K,<br>\
TA:) and a thing that induces doubt, or suspicion, or evil opinion; as also ↓ دَخَلٌ [app.<br>\
in all the senses explained in this sentence: each<br>\
originally an inf. n.: see دُخِلَ and دَخِلَ]. (S,<br>\
K.) Hence the saying, (S, TA,) of<br>\
دَخُلَ Athmeh<br>\
Bint-Matrood, (TA,)<br>\
وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ بِالدَّخْلِ  تَرَى الفِتْيَانَ كَالنَّخْلِ<br>\
[Thou seest the youths, or young men, like palmtrees; but what will acquaint thee with the vice,<br>\
&amp;c., that is, or may be, in them]: (S, O, TA:)<br>\
applied in relation to him who is of pleasing<br>\
aspect, but devoid of good. (O, TA. [See also<br>\
another reading of this verse voce رَقْلَةٌ.])<br>\
-A3-  See<br>\
also دِخَالٌ:<br>\
-A4-  and دَخِلٌ.<br>\
دُخْلٌ [A species of millet;] i. q. جَاوَرْسٌ; as<br>\
also دُخْنٌ. (TA.)<br>\
دِخْلٌ: see دُخْلَةٌ.<br>\
دَخَلٌ primarily signifies A thing that enters<br>\
into another thing and is not of it. (Bd in<br>\
xvi. 94.) See دَخْلٌ, in three places. Also Badness, corruptness, or unsoundness; or a bad, a<br>\
corrupt, or an unsound, state or quality; (S in<br>\
art. دغل, and K;) in intellect or in body [&amp;c.].<br>\
(K.) You say, فِى عَقْلِهِ دَخَلٌ [In his intellect is<br>\
an unsoundness]. (S, K.) And هٰذَاالأَمْرُ فِيهِ دَخَلٌ<br>\
and دَغَلٌ [This affair, or case, in it is an unsoundness]: both signify the same. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Rottenness in a palm-tree. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Leanness, or emaciation. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Perfidiousness, faithlessness,<br>\
or treachery: (K and TA; but not in the CK:)<br>\
deceit, guile, or circumvention. (S, K.) Hence,<br>\
in the Kur [xvi. 96], وَلَا تَتَّخِذُوا أَيْمَانَكُمْ دَخَلًا<br>\
بَيْنَكُمْ [And make ye not your oaths to be a means<br>\
of] deceit, or guile, or circumvention, between<br>\
you. (S, TA. [And in the same sense it is used<br>\
in verse 94 of the same ch.])<br>\
-A2-  Also People, or<br>\
persons, who assert their relationship to those of<br>\
whom they are not: (K:) in this sense thought<br>\
by ISd to be a quasi-pl. n. [app. of دَخِيلٌ (q. v.),<br>\
like as شَرَفٌ is of شَرِيفٌ]. (TA.) You say,<br>\
هُمْ دَخَلٌ فِى بَنِى فُلَانٍ They are, among the sons<br>\
of such a one, persons who assert their relationship to them not being of them. (S, K.) [But<br>\
Freytag asserts, though without naming any<br>\
authority, evidently taking it from the TK, in<br>\
which I find it, that one says, هم دخل لهم, and<br>\
also هو; thus applying it to a single person<br>\
(which is questionable) as well as to a plurality.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And Tangled, or luxuriant, or abundant and<br>\
dense, trees; (K;) as also دَغَلٌ. (TA.)<br>\
دَخِلٌ Intrinsically bad or corrupt or unsound:<br>\
and ↓ دَخْلٌ occurs in the same sense at the end of<br>\
a verse: this may be a contraction of the former,<br>\
or it may be for ذُو دَخْلٍ. (TA.)<br>\
دَخْلَةٌ A place in which bees, (K,) or wild bees,<br>\
(AA, TA,) deposit their honey. (AA, K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also the next paragraph.<br>\

a bride to her husband. (TA.) [In the present<br>\
day, this night is commonly called لَيْلَةُالدُّخْلَةِ;<br>\
vulgarly لَيْلَة اَلدُّخْلَهْ.]<br>\
-A2-  (assumed tropical:)  The inward, or intrinsic, state, or circumstances, of a man; as<br>\
also ↓ دَاخِلَةٌ: (S:) or, as also ↓ دِخْلَةٌ and ↓ دَخْلَةٌ<br>\
and ↓ دَخِيلَةٌ and ↓ دَخِيلٌ and ↓ دُخْلُلٌ and ↓ دُخْلَلٌ<br>\
and ↓ دُخَيْلَآءُ and ↓ دَاخِلَةٌ and ↓ دُخَّلٌ and ↓ دِخَالٌ,<br>\

↓ دُخَّيْلَى and ↓ دِخْلٌ and ↓ دَخْلٌ (assumed tropical:)  a man&#39;s intention: his way of acting, or his opinion: his<br>\
whole case or circumstances: his mind, or heart:<br>\
and his secret. (K.) You say, هُوَ عَالِمٌ بِدُخْلَتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
is acquainted with his inward, or intrinsic, state or<br>\
circumstances. (S.) And every one of the foregoing<br>\
fourteen syn. words is prefixed to the word أَمْر,<br>\
so that you say, عَرَفْتُ دُخْلَةَ أَمْرِهِ &amp;c., meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I knew the whole [of the inward, or intrinsic,<br>\
circumstances] of his case. (TA.) ↓ فَرَشْتُهُ دِخْلَةَ<br>\
أَمْرِى, or فَرَشْتُ لَهُ دِخْلَةَ أَمْرِى, is a post-classical<br>\
prov., meaning (assumed tropical:)  I laid open to him the inward,<br>\
or intrinsic, and true, or real, state of my case.<br>\
(Har p. 306.) One says also, ↓ هُوَ حَسَنُّ الدِّخْلَةِ<br>\
and ↓ المَدْخَلِ (tropical:)  He is good in his way of acting<br>\
in his affairs: (K, TA:) and ↓ فُلَانٌ حَسَنُ المَدْخَلِ<br>\
وَالمَخْرَجِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is good, and laudable, in<br>\
his way of acting, or conduct. (TA.)<br>\

voce وَلِيجَةٌ) and ↓ دِخْلَةٌ [app. for صَاحِبُ دِخْلَة]:<br>\
(L voce وَلِيجَةٌ:) [the pl.] دُخْلُلُونَ signifies<br>\
special, or particular, and choice, or select,<br>\
friends: (Az, TA:) or دُخْلُلٌ signifies, as also<br>\
↓ دِخْلَلٌ and ↓ دَخِيلٌ and ↓ مُدَاخِلٌ, one who enters<br>\
with another into the affairs of the latter: (K,<br>\
TA:) [i. e.] الرَّجُلِ ↓ دَخِيلُ and دُخْلُلُهُ signify the<br>\
man&#39;s particular, or special, intimate, who enters<br>\
with him into his affairs. (S.) You say, بَيْنَهُمَا<br>\
دُخْلُلٌ and ↓ دِخْلَلٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Between them two<br>\
is a particular, or special, intimate, who enters<br>\
with them into their affairs: so says Lh: but<br>\
ISd says, I know not what it is: accord. to the T,<br>\
on the authority of AO, the meaning is, between<br>\
them is brotherhood, or fraternization, and love,<br>\
or affection: and accord. to ISd and the K,<br>\
الحُبِّ ↓ دُخْلَلٌ and دُخْلُلُهُ [the latter not in the<br>\
CK nor in my MS. copy of the K] and ↓ دَاخِلُهُ signify (assumed tropical:)  purity of inward love. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  دُخْلُلُونَ<br>\
signifies also Persons of the lower, or lowest, sort,<br>\
who enter among a people, or party, of whom<br>\
they are not: thus having two contr. meanings.<br>\
(Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  الدخلل [app. الدُّخْلُلُ] and ↓ الدُّخَّالُ<br>\
[thus in the TA] and ↓ الدَّاخِلُ, accord. to IAar,<br>\
all signify The same as الأُذُنِ ↓ دَخَّالِ [an appellation now applied to the ear-wig; in the K, art.<br>\
عقرب, said to be the عُقْرُبَان, but not as meaning<br>\
the عَقْرَب or the male عَقْرَب]: accord. to AZ, it<br>\
is the هرنصان [i. e. هِرْنِصَان or هِرِنْصَان, a kind of<br>\
worm, the species of which is doubtful]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\

(K,) or the bringing back a camel, that has<br>\
drunk, from the resting-place by the water, to the<br>\
watering-trough, and putting him in between two<br>\
thirsty camels, (S,) in order that he may drink<br>\
what, may-be, he has not drunk: (S, K:) in like<br>\
manner it is explained in the T, on the authority<br>\
of As, who adds that this is done only when the<br>\
water is scanty: (TA:) or the putting in a weak<br>\
or sick camel [that has already drunk] with those<br>\
that are drinking, and then, after that, with those<br>\
that are returning to the water, so that he drinks<br>\
three times: (Skr:) or the driving of camels to<br>\

↓ دُخْلُلٌ: (K:) n. un. دُخَّلَةٌ: ISd says that it is<br>\
an intrusive bird, smaller than the sparrow, found<br>\

Book of Birds,” that the دُخَّلَة is a certain bird<br>\

and is caught by children: when winter comes,<br>\
the birds of this kind disperse; and some of them<br>\
become of a dusky colour, and of a dark and<br>\

-b2-<br>\
It is [also] applied as an epithet to a disease, and<br>\

a subst.,] The interior of anything; (M, Msb, *<br>\
TA;) contr. of خَارِجٌ. (Msb.) Sb says that it<br>\
is not used adverbially unless with a particle; [so<br>\

but you say فِى دَاخِلٍ; and in like manner you<br>\
say إِلَى دَاخِلٍ meaning In, or inwards; and<br>\
مِنْ دَاخِلٍ meaning From within;] i. e. it is only<br>\
a subst.; because it has a special signification,<br>\
like يَدٌ and رِجْلٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  دَاخِلُ الحُبِّ: see<br>\
دُخْلُلٌ.<br>\
