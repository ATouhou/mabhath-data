(M, Msb, K,) with his hand: (S, M, Msb, K:)<br>\
[or he did so well: or he pressed it, or squeezed it,<br>\
and rubbed it: for] دَلْكٌ signifies the act of rubbing, or rubbing and pressing, well: (KL:) or<br>\
the act of pressing, or squeezing, and rubbing:<br>\
(Ham p. 798:) [and in like manner, ↓ دلّكهُ, inf. n.<br>\
تَدْلِيكٌ, signifies in the present day he rubbed it,<br>\
or rubbed it and pressed it; and particularly, a<br>\
person&#39;s body and limbs, in the bath: its proper<br>\
meaning, however, is, he rubbed it, or rubbed it<br>\
and pressed it, much or well: Golius explains it as<br>\
signifying he rubbed it much or well on the anthority of the KL; but it is not in my copy of<br>\
that work.] You say, دَلَكَ الثَّوْبَ He rubbed, or<br>\
rubbed and pressed, the garment, or piece of cloth,<br>\
to wash it. (TA.) And دَلَكْتُ السُّنْبُلَ حَتَّى<br>\

the ground. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] دَلَكَهُ الدَّهْرُ<br>\
(tropical:) Time, or fortune, disciplined him well, tried, or<br>\

or firm or sound in judgment, and taught him??<br>\
(K,* TA.) And دَلَكَتْهُ الأَسْفَارُ (tropical:)  Journeyings inured<br>\
him to them; namely, a camel. (TA.) And<br>\
دُلِكَ بِالأَسْفَارِ, said of a camel, (A, O, L, K,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
was inured by journeyings, and habituated thereto:<br>\
(A, L:) or he was fatigued, or jaded, by journeyings; like [دُكَّ and] كُدَّ. (O, TA.) ―<br>\

-A2-  دَلَكَتِ الشَّمْسُ, (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
دَلُكَ, (Msb,) inf. n. دُلُوكٌ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
&amp;c.,) (tropical:)  The sun set; (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.;)<br>\
accord. to Z, because he who looks at it rubs<br>\
(يَدْلُكُ) his eyes, so that it is as though it were the<br>\
rubber; (TA;) and i(??) like manner, النُّجُومُ the<br>\
stars: (Msb:) or became yellow, (K, TA,) and<br>\
inclined to setting: (TA:) or declined (K, * TA)<br>\
so that the beholder almost required, when looking<br>\
at it, to contract the rays from his eyes with the<br>\
palm of his hand: (TA:) or declined after midday: (Ibn-&#39;Omar, TA:) or it signifies (or signifies<br>\
also, Msb) the sun declined from the meridian,<br>\
or midheaven, (I&#39;Ab, Fr, Zj, Az, S, * Mgh, *<br>\
Msb, K, &amp;c.,) at noon; (I&#39;Ab, Fr, Zj, Az;) and<br>\
in like manner, النُّجُومُ the stars. (Msb.) Az<br>\
says that, in his opinion, the words of the Kur<br>\
[xvii. 80] أَقِمَ الصَّلَاةَ لِدُلُوكِ الشَّمْسِ (TA) mean<br>\
Perform thou prayer from the declining of the<br>\
sun at noon: so that the command expressed by<br>\
these words with what follows them includes the<br>\
five prayers: (Mgh, * TA:) for by the دلوك are<br>\
included the first prayer [of noon] and that of the<br>\
عَصْر; and by the غَسَق of night, the two prayers<br>\
[of sunset and nightfall] of which each is called<br>\
عِشَآء; and by the قُرْآن of the فَجْر, the prayer of<br>\
daybreak: if you make the دلوك to be the setting,<br>\
the command is restricted to three prayers: in the<br>\
language of the Arabs, دُلُوكٌ is said to be syn.<br>\
with زَوَالٌ; and therefore the sun is said to be<br>\
دَالِكَةٌ when it is declining at noon and when it is<br>\
setting. (TA.) [Respecting the phrase دَلَكَتْ بَرَاحِ<br>\
or بِرَاحِ, accord. to different readings, occurring at<br>\
the end of a verse, see بَرَاحِ, and see also رَاحَةٌ in<br>\
art. روح.] It is said in [one of the works entitled]<br>\
the “ Nawádir el-Aaráb,” that دَلَكَتِ الشَّمْسُ signifies The sun became high; like دَمَكَت and عَلَت<br>\
and اِعْتَلَت. (TA.)<br>\

delayed, or deferred, with him, or put him off,<br>\
(namely, his creditor, S, TA,) promising him<br>\

asked, أَيُدَالِكُ الرَّجُلُ امْرَأَتَهُ [May the man delay,<br>\
or defer, with his wife?], meaning, in the matter<br>\
of the dowry; and he answered, “Yes, if he be in<br>\

S, TA.) And you say likewise, الرَّجُلَ حَقَّهُ ↓ دَلَكَ<br>\

giving the man his right, or due. (TA.) ―<br>\
