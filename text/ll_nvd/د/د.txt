د<br>\
The eighth letter of the alphabet: called دَالٌ. It<br>\
is one of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة [or vocal, i. e.<br>\
pronounced with the voice, not with the breath<br>\
only]; and of the letters termed نِطَعِيَّة [pronounced by pressing the tip of the tongue against<br>\
the upper gums and suddenly withdrawing it],<br>\
like ط and ت. (TA.) It is substituted, agreeably with general usage, for the ت of the form<br>\
اِفْتَعَلَ and its variations, when the first radical<br>\
letter is ز, as in اِزْدَادَ [for اِزْتَادَ]; or ذ, as in اِدَّكَرَ<br>\
[for اِذْدَكَرَ, originally اِذْتَكَرَ]; or د, as in اِدَّرَأَ<br>\
[for اِدْدَرَأَ, originally اِدْتَرَأَ]: and sometimes after<br>\
ج, as in اِجْدَمَعُوا, a dial. var. of اِجْتَمَعُوا: also,<br>\
sometimes, for the pronominal affix ت after د,<br>\
as in جَلَدُّ for جَلَدْتُ; and after ز, as in جُزْدُ for<br>\
جُزْتُ: it is also substituted for the ت of تَوْلَجٌ,<br>\
contr. to analogy: and it occurs substituted for<br>\
ط, contr. to general usage, as in مَرَدَى for مَرَطَى.<br>\
