دَرِعَ, aor.<br>\
دَرَعَ, inf. n. دَرَعٌ, He (a horse, and a<br>\
sheep or goat,) was black in the head, and white<br>\
[in the other parts]: or, as some say, was black<br>\
in the head and neck. (Msb: [in my copy of<br>\
which is an evident omission, which I have<br>\
supplied: see أَدْرَعُ.]) [See also دَرَعٌ, below.]<br>\
2<br>\
درّع, inf. n. تَدْرِيعٌ, (S, K,) He clad a man<br>\
with a دِرْع, (K,) i. e. a درع of iron [or coat of<br>\
mail]: (TA:) and a woman with a قَمِيص [or<br>\
shift]. (S, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
ادرع الشَّهْرُ, (K,) inf. n. إِدْرَاعٌ, (TA,) The<br>\
month passed its half. (ISh, K.) إِدْرَاعُهُ also signifies The blackness of its first part. (ISh.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَدَرَّعَ see 8, in three places.<br>\
8<br>\
اِدَّرَعَ He (a man) clad himself with a دِرْعٌ<br>\
(S K) of iron [i. e. a coat of mail]; (K;) as<br>\
also ↓ تدرّع. (S, K.) And اِدَّرَعَتْ She (a woman)<br>\
clad herself with a دِرْع, (S, K,) i. e. a قَمِيص [or<br>\
shift]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ادّرع مِدْرَعَةً, and ↓ تدرّعها, and<br>\
↓ تَمَدْرَعَهَا, (Kh,) and ↓ تدرّع alone, (S,) and<br>\
↓ تَمَدْرَعَ, (S, K,) but this last is of weak authority, (S,) He clad himself with a مِدْرَعَة [q. v.].<br>\
(S, K,) ―<br>\
-b3-  ادّرع فُلَانٌ اللَّيْلِ (tropical:)  Such a one entered<br>\
into the darkness of the night, journeying therein;<br>\
(K, TA;) like اِغْتَمَدَ اللَّيْلَ. (S and L in art.<br>\
غمد.) Hence the saying, (TA,) شَمِّرْ ذَيْلًا وَادَّرِعْ<br>\
لَيْلًا (tropical:)  Use thou prudence, or precaution, or good<br>\
judgment, and journey all the night. (S, K.)<br>\
[See also art. شمر.] ―<br>\
-b4-  ادّرع الخَوْفَ (tropical:)  He made<br>\
fear as it were his innermost garment; by closely<br>\
cleaving to it. (TA.)<br>\
Q. Q. 2<br>\
تَمَدْرَعَ: see 8, in two places.<br>\
دِرْعٌ A coat of mail; syn. زَرَدِّيَةٌ: (IAth, Msb,<br>\
TA:) [or a coat of defence of any kind; being a<br>\
term applied in the S and K &amp;c. to a يَلَبَة, i. e.<br>\
a coat of defence of skins, or of camel&#39;s hide:]<br>\
and also, of plate-armour: (AO, in his book on<br>\
the دِرْع and بَيْضَة, cited in the TA voce مِغْفَرٌ:)<br>\
[but the first is the most general, and proper,<br>\
meaning:] as meaning a دِرْع of iron, it is fem.;<br>\
(S, Mgh, K *) or mostly so; (Msb;) but sometimes masc.: (K:) AO says that it is masc. and<br>\
fem.; (S, TA;) and so Lh: (TA:) pl. أَدْرُعٌ and<br>\
أَدْرَاعٌ and دُرُوعٌ; (S, Msb, K;) the first and second,<br>\
pls. of pauc.; the third, a pl. of mult. (S.) The<br>\
dim. is ↓ دُرَيْعٌ, which is anomalous, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
for by rule it should be with ة; (S;) or this<br>\
may be [a regular form] of the dial. of those who<br>\
make the word masc.; and some say ↓ دُرَيْعَةٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A woman&#39;s قَمِيص [or shift]; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) a garment, or piece of cloth, in the<br>\
middle of which a woman cuts an opening for<br>\
the head to be put through, and to which she puts<br>\
arms [or sleeves], and the two openings of which<br>\
[at the two sides] she sews up: (T, TA:) or a<br>\
woman&#39;s garment which is worn above the قَمِيص:<br>\
or, accord. to El-Hulwánee, one of which the<br>\
opening for the head to pass through extends<br>\
towards, or to, the bosom; whereas the قميص is<br>\
one of which the slit is towards, or to, the<br>\
shoulder-joint; but this [says Mtr] I find not in<br>\
the lexicons: (Mgh:) a small garment which a<br>\
young girl wears in her house, or chamber, or<br>\
tent: (TA:) as meaning a woman&#39;s دِرْع, it is<br>\
masc., (Lh, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) only; (Lh;) or<br>\
sometimes fem.: (TA:) pl. أَدْرَاعٌ. (S, K.) [See<br>\
a verse cited voce مِجْوَلٌ.]<br>\
دَرَعٌ Whiteness in the breast of a sheep, or goat,<br>\
and in its نَحْر [or part where it is slaughtered,<br>\
but وَنَحْرِهَا, in the K, is probably a mistranscription, for وَنَحْوِهَا, meaning and the like thereof,<br>\
i. e., of the sheep, or goat], and blackness in the<br>\
thigh. (Lth, K.) [See also 1; and see دُرْعَةٌ.]<br>\
لَيَالٍ دُرَعٌ: see أَدْرَعُ.<br>\
دُرْعَةٌ, in a horse, and in a sheep or goat, Blackness of the head, and whiteness [of the other<br>\
parts]: or, accord. to some, blackness of the head<br>\
and neck: a subst. from دَرِعَ [q. v.]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also أَدْرَعُ, in the middle of the paragraph.<br>\
دِرْعِيَّةٌ, applied to an arrow-head or the like,<br>\
Penetrating into, or piercing through, the coats<br>\
of mail: pl. دَرَاعِىُّ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
دُرَيْعٌ and دُرَيْعَةٌ: see دِرْعٌ.<br>\
دُرَّاعَةٌ: see مِدْرَعَةٌ, in four places.<br>\
دَارِعٌ Having, or possessing, a دِرْع [or coat of<br>\
mail]: (Mgh:) or a man having upon him a<br>\
دِرْع; (S, K;) as though having, or possessing,<br>\
a دِرْع; [being properly a possessive epithet] like<br>\
لَابِنٌ and تَامِرٌ. (S.)<br>\
أَدْرَعُ, applied to a horse, and to a sheep or<br>\
goat, Having a black head, the rest being white:<br>\
(S, Msb, * K:) or, as some say, having a black<br>\
head and neck, (Msb, TA,) the rest being white:<br>\
(TA:) or having a white head and neck, the rest<br>\
being black: (TA:) fem. دَرْعَآءُ: (S, Msb:) pl.<br>\
دُرْعٌ: (S:) or دَرْعَآءُ signifies having what is termed<br>\
دَرَعٌ [q. v.]; applied to a sheep or goat, (K,) and<br>\
to a mare: (TA:) or a sheep or goat black in<br>\
the body, and white in the head: or black in the<br>\
neck and head, the rest of her being white: or,<br>\
accord. to AZ, a ewe having a black neck: or,<br>\
accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, sheep or goats differing<br>\
in colour: or, accord. to ISh, black except in<br>\
having the neck white: and red [or brown], but<br>\
having the neck white: and also, having the head<br>\
with the neck white: accord. to Az, the right<br>\
explanation is that given by AZ, meaning having<br>\
the fore part black; being likened to the nights<br>\
termed دُرَعٌ; or the latter are likened to the<br>\
former: and hence, (TA,) ―<br>\
-b2-  لَيْلَةٌ دَرْعَآءُ (tropical:)  A night<br>\
of which the moon rises at the dawn, (K,) or at<br>\
the commencement of the dawn; the rest thereof<br>\
being black, and dark. (TA.) And ↓ لَيَالٍ دُرَعٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) said by AHát to have been heard by him<br>\
only on the authority of AO, but so accord. to<br>\
As and A &#39;Obeyd and AHeyth, (TA,) and دُرْعٌ;<br>\
(K;) the former contr. to rule, for by<br>\
rule it should be دُرْعٌ, its sing. being دَرْعَآءُ;<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S;) or, accord. to AHeyth, you say<br>\
ثَلَاثٌ دُرَعٌ وَثَلَاثٌ ظُلَمٌ, and دُرَعٌ and ظُلَمٌ are pls.<br>\
of ↓ دُرْعَةٌ and ظُلْمَةٌ, not of دَرْعَآءُ and ظَلْمَآءُ; and<br>\
Az says that this is correct and regular; but IB<br>\
says that دَرْعَآءُ has دُرَعٌ for its pl. for the purpose<br>\
of assimilation to ظُلَمٌ in the saying ثَلَاثٌ ظُلَمٌ<br>\
وَثَلَاثٌ دُرَعٌ, and that no other instance had been<br>\
heard by him of a word of the measure فَعْلَآءُ<br>\
having a pl. of the measure فُعَلٌ; (TA;) (tropical:)  Three<br>\
nights of the month which follow those called<br>\
البِيضُ; (As, S, K; *) namely, the sixteenth and<br>\
seventeenth and eighteenth nights; (TA;) because<br>\
of the blackness of their first parts, and the whiteness of the rest thereof: (S, K:) there is no<br>\
difference in what As and AZ and ISh say respecting them: but some say that they are the<br>\
thirteenth and fourteenth and fifteenth; because<br>\
part of them is black and part of them white:<br>\
[this, however, seems to have originated from a<br>\
misunderstanding of an explanation running thus;<br>\
three nights of the month which follow those<br>\
called البِيض, which, meaning the latter, are the<br>\
thirteenth &amp;c.; for the thirteenth and fourteenth<br>\
and fifteenth are all white:] or, accord. to AO,<br>\
اللَّيَالِى الدُّرَعُ signifies the nights of which the fore<br>\
parts are black and the latter parts white, of the<br>\
end of the month; and those of which the fore<br>\
parts are white and the latter parts black, of the<br>\
commencement of the month. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَدْرَعُ also<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  One whose father is free, or an Arab,<br>\
and whose mother is a slave; syn. هَجِينٌ; (K;)<br>\
as also مُعَلْهَجٌ. (TA.) And قَوْمٌ دُرْعٌ (tropical:)  A people,<br>\
or company of men, of whom half are white and<br>\
half black. (TA.)<br>\
مِدْرَعٌ: see the following paragraph.<br>\
مِدْرَعَةٌ A certain garment, [a tunic,] like that<br>\
called ↓ دُرَّاعَةٌ, never of anything but wool, (Lth,<br>\
K,) [and having sleeves; for] mention is made,<br>\
in a trad., of a مدرعة narrow in the sleeve;<br>\
wherefore the wearer, in performing the ablution<br>\
termed وُضُوْء, put forth his arm from beneath the<br>\
مدرعة, and so performed that ablution: (TA:)<br>\
accord. to some, the ↓ درّاعة is a [garment of the<br>\
kind called] جُبَّة, slit in the fore part; (TA;)<br>\
[thus resembling a kind of جُبَّة worn by persons<br>\
in Northern Africa, reaching to, or below, the<br>\
knees, and having the two front edges sewed<br>\
together from the bottom, or nearly so, to about<br>\
the middle of the breast: it is said in the MA to<br>\
be a wide vest or shirt; a large جُبَّة: and the<br>\
مِدْرَعَة is there said to be a woollen دُرَّاعَة; a woollen tunic: El-Makreezee (cited by De Sacy in his<br>\
“ Chrest. Arabe,” 2nd ed., vol. i., p. 125,) describes the ↓ دراّعة as a garment worn in Egypt<br>\
particularly by Wezeers, slit in the fore part to<br>\
near the head of the heart, with buttons and<br>\
loops: Golius describes it as “ tunica gossipina,<br>\
fere grossior; ” adding, “estque exterior tum<br>\
virilis tum muliebris; ” as on the authority of J,<br>\
who says nothing of the kind, and of the Loghat<br>\
Neamet-Allah: and as epomis, seu amiculum<br>\
quod humeris injicitur; on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof: J only says,] the ↓ مِدْرَع and مِدْرَعَة are<br>\
one; and ↓ دُرَّاعَةٌ is sing. of, or signifies one of<br>\
what are called, دَرَارِيعُ: (S:) the pl. of مدرعة is<br>\
مَدَارِعُ. (MA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The [appendage called]<br>\
صُفَّة [q. v.] of a رَحْل [or camel&#39;s saddle], when<br>\
the heads of the وَاسِطَة [or fore part (Az says the<br>\
وَسَط, accord. to the TA,)] and the آخِرَة [or hinder<br>\
part] appear from [above] it. (K.)<br>\
