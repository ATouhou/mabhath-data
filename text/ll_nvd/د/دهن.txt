n. تَدْهِينٌ signifies the same [but app. in an intensive sense, or as applying to many objects]:<br>\
(TA:) and إِدْهَانٌ [inf. n. of ↓ أَدْهَنَ] is like<br>\
تَدْهِينٌ. (AHeyth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] دَهَنَ الأَرْضَ,<br>\
said of rain, (S, K,) (tropical:)  It moistened the ground<br>\
slightly, or a little: (S, TA:) or it moistened the<br>\
surface of the ground. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence also,]<br>\
دَهَنْتُهُ بِالعَصَا (S, K *) (tropical:)  I struck him (S, K, TA)<br>\
gently (TA) with the staff, or stick; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
like as one says, مَسَحَهُ بِالعَصَا and بِالسَّيْفِ. (TA.)<br>\
And دَهَنْتُهُ بِالعَصَا دَهَنَاتٍ (tropical:)  I struck him [gently]<br>\
with the staff or stick [some gentle strokes:<br>\
دَهَنَاتٌ being pl. of ↓ دَهْنَةٌ, which is the inf. n. of<br>\
un.]. (So in a copy of the S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence, likewise,] دَهَنَ signifies also He (a man, TA) played<br>\
the hypocrite. (K, TA.) And you say, دَهَنَ فُلَانًا,<br>\
aor.<br>\
دَهُنَ, inf. n. دَهْنٌ, meaning He acted with such<br>\
a one hypocritically. (TK. [See also 3.])<br>\

-b2-  And دَهِنَ, inf. n. دَهْنٌ, [or,<br>\
as appears to be probable from what follows and<br>\
from general analogy, دَهَنٌ,] said of a man, (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
was, or became, weak: and also, foolish, or stupid:<br>\
and [app. soft, flaccid, or flabby; for] دَهَنٌ signifies the being soft, flaccid, or flabby; or softness,<br>\
flaccidity, or flabbiness. (JK.) [See دَهِينٌ.]<br>\
2<br>\
دَهَّنَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\

مُدَاهَنَهٌ and ↓ إِدْهَانٌ signify the same; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) i. e. (tropical:)  The endeavouring to conciliate;<br>\
syn. مُصَانَعَةٌ: (S, TA:) or the making peace with<br>\
another; or becoming reconciled with another:<br>\
(Msb:) or the pretending the contrary of, or what<br>\
is different from, that which one conceals in his<br>\
mind: (K:) and the former signifies also the<br>\
acting with dishonesty, or dissimulation: or ↓ the<br>\
latter has this signification; and the former signifies the striving to outwit, deceive, beguile, or<br>\
circumvent; syn. مُوَارَبَةٌ: (TA:) or دَاهَنْتُ signifies<br>\
I hid, concealed, or covered; syn. وَارَيْتُ [accord.<br>\
to four copies of the S; but probably this is a mistranscription for وَارَبْتُ, meaning I strove to outwit, deceive, beguile, or circumvent, as is indicated<br>\
in the TA]; and ↓ أَدْهَنْتُ signifies I acted with<br>\
dishonesty, or dissimulation: (S:) or ↓ إِدْهَانٌ is<br>\
[originally] like تَدْهِينٌ [as has been stated above]:<br>\
but is used as denoting the act of treating with<br>\
gentleness or blandishment, soothing, coaxing,<br>\
wheedling, beguiling, or deluding; and abstaining<br>\
from restraint or prohibition: (AHeyth, TA:) or<br>\
it originally signified the anointing such a thing<br>\
as a hide with some oil or the like: and as such a<br>\
thing is rendered soft to the sense [of feeling], it<br>\
was used tropically, or metaphorically, to denote<br>\
ideal softness, absolutely: hence, the treating<br>\
with gentleness or blandishment, soothing, coaxing,<br>\
wheedling, beguiling, or deluding, was termed<br>\
مُدَاهَنَةٌ: then this tropical signification became<br>\
commonly known, and conventionally regarded as<br>\
proper: and then the word [مداهنة or ↓ ادهان, or<br>\
rather each of these words,] was tropically used as<br>\
signifying the holding a thing in light, or little, or<br>\
mean, estimation, or in contempt: so in the<br>\
&#39;Ináyeh. (MF, TA.) It is said in the Kur [lxviii.<br>\
9], ↓ وَدُّوالَوْ تُدْهِنُ فَيُدْهِنُونَ (tropical:)  They wish that thou<br>\
wouldst endeavour to conciliate [them], and in<br>\
that case they will endeavour to conciliate [thee]:<br>\
(S, TA: *) or that thou wouldst be soft, pliant, or<br>\
gentle, in thy religion, and in that case they will<br>\
be soft, pliant, or gentle: (TA:) or that thou<br>\
wouldst be soft, pliant, or gentle, to them, and in<br>\
that case they will be so to thee: (Jel:) or, accord.<br>\
to Fr, that thou wouldst be an unbeliever, and they<br>\
will be unbelievers. (TA.)<br>\

الإِبْقَآءُ, which, accord. to IAmb, is the primary<br>\
signification: in the copies of the K erroneously<br>\
written الإِنْقَآءُ. (TA.) One says, لَا تُدْهِنْ عَلَيْهِ,<br>\
meaning لَا تُبْقِ عَلَيْهِ [Show not thou mercy to<br>\
him; or pity not him; or pardon not him].<br>\
(IAmb, TA.) And مَا أَدْهَنْتَ إِلَّا عَلَى نَفْسِكَ, i. e.<br>\

pls. signifying kinds of oil &amp;c.;] or ↓ الدِّهَانُ signifies that with which one anoints; (Bd ubi<br>\
suprà) or it has this signification also: (TA:)<br>\
you say, دَهَنْتُهُ بِالدِّهَانِ [meaning I anointed him<br>\

colours, by reason of the very great terror, like<br>\
divers oils: or, accord. to Er-Rághib, like the<br>\
