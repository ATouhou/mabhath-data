or suspicion, or evil opinion; [in an affair; or]<br>\
in a man: (Mgh ubi suprà:) or a cause of badness, corruption, or unsoundness, in an affair.<br>\

and so by IF in the Mj, (TA,) as on the authority of A &#39;Obeyd, who said only دَغَاوِل, (K,) and<br>\
thus it is in a verse of Sakhr El-Hudhalee:<br>\
(TA:) [but in one of my copies of the S it is<br>\
written دَغَاوِل:] it has no sing.: (K:) or, as<br>\
El-Bekree says, its sing. is not known: but<br>\
some say that it is دغولة [thus without any syll.<br>\
signs]. (TA.)<br>\
دَاغِلٌ One who seeks, or desires, to do evil, or<br>\
