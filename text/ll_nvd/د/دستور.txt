Persian دَسْتُورْ,] by some of the Arabs, [and in<br>\
the present day generally,] pronounced دَسْتُورٌ,<br>\
which is not absolutely erroneous, as it is the<br>\
original form of the word before its being arabicized, (MF,) The copy, or original, [of the<br>\
register, as will be seen from what follows,]<br>\
which is made for the several classes [of the<br>\
officers and servants of the government], from<br>\
which their transcription is made, (expl. by<br>\
النُّسْخَةُ المَعْمُولَةُ لِلْجَمَاعَاتِ التَّىِ مِنْهَا تَحْرِيرُهَا, K,)<br>\
and in which are collected the rules and ordinances of the King; (TA;) the register (دَفْتَر)<br>\
in which are collected the rules of the realm:<br>\
(Kull p. 186:) pl. دَسَاتِيرُ. (K.) ―<br>\

great wezeer (وَزِير) to whom recourse is had [by<br>\
the King] with respect to what he may prescribe<br>\
concerning the circumstances of the people, because<br>\
he is the possessor of the register so called:<br>\
(Mefáteeh el-&#39;Uloom by Ibn-Kemál-Páshà, in<br>\
TA; and Kull ubi suprà:) the officer who manages, conducts, orders, or regulates, the affairs<br>\
of the King. (TA.) ―<br>\

―<br>\
-b4-  Also, vulgarly, Permission; leave. (TA.)<br>\
[For instance, it is used in this sense by a man<br>\
entering a house, or approaching an apartment,<br>\
in which he supposes that there may be some<br>\
woman whom he should not see unveiled, in<br>\
order that she may veil herself or retire: on such<br>\
an occasion, he repeats the word دستور several<br>\
times as he advances.]<br>\
