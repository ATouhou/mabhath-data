دَرْهَمَتْ, said of the خُبَازَى [or mallow],<br>\
(K, TA,) It became round [in its leaves]; (TA;)<br>\
its leaves became like [the silver coins called]<br>\
دَرَاهِم. (K.)<br>\
Q. 4<br>\
اِدْرَهَمَّ, (S, K,) inf. n. اِدْرِهْمَامٌ, (S,) He<br>\
(a man, TA) became aged: (K, TA:) or he (an<br>\
old man) tottered (سَقَطَ) by reason of age. (S,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ادرهمّ بَصَرَهُ His sight became dim, or<br>\
obscure. (K.)<br>\
دِرْهَمٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) of the measure فِعْلَلٌ,<br>\
(Msb, MF,) of which it has been said that there<br>\
are only three other instances, but there are<br>\
many more; (MF;) an arabicized word, (S,<br>\
Msb,) from the Pers. [دِرَمْ]; (S;) also pronounced ↓ دِرْهِمٌ, (S, Msb, K,) but this is of rare<br>\
occurrence; (TA;) and ↓ دِرْهَامٌ, (S, K,) which is<br>\
more rare; (TA;) A certain silver coin; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) like as دِينَارٌ signifies a certain gold coin:<br>\
(Mgh:) [and the weight thereof; i. e. a drachm,<br>\
or dram:] its weight is six دَوَانِيق [or dániks];<br>\
(Msb, and K in art. مك;) i. e., the weight of the<br>\
دِرْهَم إِسْلَامِىّ: but in the Time of Ignorance,<br>\
some dirhems were light, being four دوانيق; and<br>\
these were called طَبَرِيَّةٌ: and some were heavy,<br>\
being eight دوانيق; and these were called عَبْدِيَّةٌ,<br>\
or بَغْلِيَّةٌ: and of these two they made two that<br>\
were equal; so that each درهم was six دوانيق:<br>\
this is said to have been done by &#39;Omar: or,<br>\
accord. to another account, some dirhems were of<br>\
the weight of twenty carats, and were called the<br>\
weight of ten [i. e. of ten dániks]; and some were<br>\
of the weight of ten [carats], and were called the<br>\
weight of five; and some were of the weight of<br>\
twelve [carats], and were called the weight of six;<br>\
and they put the three weights together, and called<br>\
the third part thereof the weight of seven: and<br>\
one of the weights of the درهم before El-Islám<br>\
was twelve carats, which is six دوانيق: but the<br>\
درهم اسلامىّ is sixteen carats; the دانق of this<br>\
being a carat and two thirds: (Msb:) or dirhems<br>\
should be fourteen carats [i. e. seven dániks]; ten<br>\
being of the weight of seven مَثَاقِيل [or mithkáls]:<br>\
in the Time of Ignorance, some were heavy,<br>\
[equal to] مثاقيل; and some were light, [called]<br>\
طَبَرِيَّةٌ; and when they were coined in the age<br>\
of El-Islám, they made of the heavy and the light<br>\
two dirhems, so that ten became equal to seven<br>\
مثاقيل: A &#39;Obeyd says that this was done in the<br>\
time [of the dynasty] of the sons of Umeiyeh:<br>\
(El-Karkhee, cited in the Mgh:) [see also De<br>\
Sacy&#39;s “ Chrest. Arabe,” sec. ed., vol. ii. p. 110<br>\
of the Arabic text, and p. 282 of the transl.; where<br>\
it is further stated, on the authority of Ibn-Khaldoon, that the دِرْهَم مَغْرِبِىّ was three دوانيق; and<br>\
the يَمَنِىّ, one دانق; and, as is said in the Msb,<br>\
that &#39;Omar adopted the mean between the بغلىّ<br>\
and the طبرىّ, making the درهم to be six:] the<br>\
pl. (of درهم, S) is دَرَاهِمُ and (of درهام, S) دَرَاهِيمُ.<br>\
(S, K.) [The former of these pls. is often used<br>\
as signifying Money, cash, or coin, in an absolute sense.] The dim. is ↓ دُرَيْهِمٌ and ↓ دُرَيْهِيمٌ:<br>\
the latter held by Sb to be anomalous; for he<br>\
says that it is as though it were formed from<br>\
دِرْهَامٌ, though this was not used by them. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, as being likened thereto, [i. e., to the<br>\
coin thus called,] (TA,) دِرْهَمٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
حَدِيقَة [app. as meaning a round piece of land<br>\
surrounded by a fence or the like, or by elevated<br>\
land; for this is one of the significations of<br>\
حَدِيقَةٌ]. (K.) [It is said that] this is taken from<br>\
the saying of &#39;Antarah, [describing shower of<br>\
copious rain,]<br>\
فَتَرَكْنَ كُلَّ حَدِيقَةٍ كَالدِّرْهَمِ<br>\
[So that they left every ridged-round spot of<br>\
ground like the درهم]. (TA.) [But accord. to<br>\
one reading, he said, كُلَّ قَرَارَةٍ; meaning, as is<br>\
said in the EM, p. 227, “every round hollow; ”<br>\
and likening such a hollow to the درهم because of<br>\
its roundness, and the clearness and whiteness of<br>\
its water.]<br>\

دُرَيْهِيمٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مُدَرْهَمٌ A man possessing many دَرَاهِم: (AZ,<br>\
K:) it has no verb: (TA:) you should not say<br>\
دُرْهِمَ. (AZ, K.)<br>\
مُدْرَهِمٌّ An old man tottering (سَاقِطٌ) by reason<br>\
of age. (S, K.)<br>\
