دَفَقَهُ, aor.<br>\
دَفُقَ (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and<br>\
دَفِقَ, (Jm,<br>\
K,) inf. n. دَفْقٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) and by poetic<br>\
license دَفَقٌ, (TA,) He poured it forth, or out:<br>\
(S, K:) or he poured it forth, or out, with vehemence: (Mgh, Msb:) namely, water [&amp;c.]. (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb.) And دُفِقَ المَآءُ The water poured<br>\
out, or forth: one should not say دَفَقَ المَآءُ: (S:)<br>\
or this last, aor.<br>\
دَفُقَ, inf. n. دَفْقٌ, signifies the water<br>\
poured forth, or out, with vehemence: but As<br>\
disallowed its being used in an intrans. sense:<br>\
(Msb:) [the forms of the verb commonly used<br>\
intransitively are 7 and 5:] accord. to Lth, alone,<br>\
(K,) i. e. in the &#39;Eyn, (TA,) دَفَقَ المآءُ, (K, TA,)<br>\
and الدَّمْعُ, aor.<br>\
دَفُقَ, (TA,) inf. n. دَفْقٌ and دُفُوقٌ,<br>\
signify the water, (K, TA,) and the tears, (TA,)<br>\
poured forth, or out, at once: (K. TA:) but<br>\
Az disallows this. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] دَفَقَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
رُوحَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [God poured forth his spirit; i. e.] God<br>\
caused him to die: (K:) or it means may he<br>\
die. (S.) As says, I alighted at the abode of an<br>\
Arab woman of the desert, and she said to a<br>\
daughter of hers, Bring to him the drinking-bowl<br>\
(العُسّ): and she brought me a drinking-bowl in<br>\
which was milk, and spilled it; whereupon she<br>\
said to her دَفَقَتْ مُهْجَتُكِ [May thy blood, or<br>\
heart&#39;s blood, be poured forth: or, as appears<br>\
from a statement above, the right reading is probably دُفِقَتْ]. (TA. [See also مُهْجَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  One<br>\
says also, of a river, or rivulet, and of a valley, دَفَقَ,<br>\
[app. for دَفَقَ المَآءَ,] meaning, It became full so<br>\
that the water poured forth, or overflowed, or<br>\
so that it poured forth the water, from its sides.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And دَفَقَ الكُوزَ He poured forth, (JK,)<br>\
or scattered, (K,) the contents of the mug at<br>\
once; (JK, K;) as also ↓ ادفقهُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  The<br>\
verb is also used transitively and intransitively in<br>\
relation to a beast: you say, دَفَقْتُ الدَّابَّةَ (assumed tropical:)  I<br>\
made the beast to hasten, or go quickly: ―<br>\
-b6-  and<br>\
دَفَقَتِ الدَّابَّةُ (assumed tropical:)  The beast hastened, or went quickly:<br>\
(Msb:) and [in like manner] one says of a quick<br>\
camel, فِى مِشْيِهِ ↓ يَتَدَفَّقُ (assumed tropical:)  [He hastens, speeds,<br>\
or presses forward, in his pace, or going]: and<br>\
الأُتُنُ ↓ تَدَفَّقَتِ The wild she-asses hastened, or<br>\
went quickly. (TA.)<br>\

دَفَقَ,] (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. دَفَقٌ, (JK, S, TA,) He (a camel) had his<br>\
teeth standing outwards: (S, TA:) or had his<br>\
elbows far apart from his sides. (JK. [See also<br>\

دَفَّقَ [دفّقهُ He poured it forth, or out, copiously,<br>\
or abundantly; namely, water &amp;c. See an ex.<br>\
of the inf. n. used as a pass. part. n. voce دَحِيقٌ.]<br>\

تَدْفِيقٌ, (K,) His two hands poured forth largess<br>\
(S, K) [copiously, or abundantly, for] it is with<br>\
teshdeed to denote muchness. (S.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَدْفَقَ see 1, in the latter half of the paragraph.<br>\
5<br>\
تدفّق i. q. تَصَبَّبَ (S, K) [meaning (as the<br>\
former is explained in the KL) It poured forth<br>\
or out, or became poured forth or out, copiously,<br>\
or abundantly; for it is quasi-pass. of دَفَّقَهُ;<br>\
though تَصَبَّبَ is said to be quasi-pass. of صَبَّهُ<br>\
like اِنْصَبَّ, and though it is said in the TA that<br>\
تدفّق is quasi-pass. of دَفَقَهُ like اندفق]. ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\

-b3-  [Hence,]<br>\
هُوَ يَتَدَفَّقُ فِى البَاطِلِ (tropical:)  He hastens to do that<br>\
which is false, vain, or unprofitable. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\

which, if allowable, is less usual]. (S, K.)<br>\

استدفق الكُوزُ The mug had its contents<br>\
poured forth or out (اِنْصَبَّ) at once. (TA.)<br>\

at once, like دُفْعَةٌ, (S and K in art. دفع, q. v.,)<br>\

a shower, fall, or storm, as meaning the quantity<br>\

good] is said in prognostication on the occasion of<br>\
the pouring forth of the contents of such a thing<br>\

-b2-  مَآءٌ دَافِقٌ means مَدْفُوقٌ<br>\
[i. e. Water poured forth or out, &amp;c.]; (IKoot,<br>\

(IKoot, S, Msb,) and عَارِفٌ meaning مَعْرُوفٌ, and<br>\
عَاصِمٌ meaning مَعْصُومٌ, (IKoot, Msb,) after a<br>\
manner obtaining among the people of El-Hijáz,<br>\
who change the مَفْعُولٌ into فَاعِل when it is used<br>\
as an epithet: (Fr, Msb, TA:) or it means ذُو دَفْقٍ<br>\
[having a pouring forth or out, &amp;c.]; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA;) accord. to Kh and Sb (TA) and<br>\
Zj; (Msb, TA;) and in like manner they say<br>\

Lth, [i. e.] in the &#39;Eyn, it means water pouring<br>\
forth, or out, at once: (TA:) it occurs in the<br>\
Kur lxxxvi. 6; where دَافِق is said by Kh and<br>\
Sb to signify مُنْدَفِق [i. e. pouring forth or out]:<br>\
(Az, TA:) and it [there] means the sperma genitale. (JK.)<br>\

-b2-  The former is also applied to a pace, or rate of going, as<br>\
meaning Quick, or swift: (S, K:) or, accord.<br>\
to AO, it means أَقْصَى العَنَقِ [the utmost of the<br>\

the S, erroneously, العُنُقِ: in the TA without<br>\
any vowel signs, app. because needless to any<br>\
but the tyro in Arabic.])<br>\
-A2-  Also, i. e. the former,<br>\
A man bowed, or bent, (IAar, K,) in his back,<br>\
(IAar,) by age or grief. (IAar, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
i. q. أَعْوَجُ [here meaning Oblique]: (Aboo-Málik, K:) applied to a هِلَال [or new moon]:<br>\
(Aboo-Málik:) Aboo-Málik says that the هلال<br>\
thus termed is better, or more auspicious, than<br>\
that termed حَاقِنٌ, which means “ having its two<br>\
extremities elevated, and its back decumbent: ”<br>\
and AZ says the like: (TA:) [or] ادفق applied<br>\
to a هلال signifies erect (مُسْتَوٍ [which must here<br>\
mean nearly, not exactly, erect,] and white, not<br>\
turning sideways upon one of its two extremities:<br>\
(K:) [and this also is esteemed more auspicious<br>\
than that termed حاقن, q. v.:] so in the “ Nawádir. ” (TA.) ―<br>\

K,) and to a mouth, (JK, TA,) Having the<br>\
