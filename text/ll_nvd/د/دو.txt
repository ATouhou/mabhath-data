دوّى He took his way in the دَوّ [q. v.].<br>\
(M, K.) And دوّى فِىالأَرْضِ He went away<br>\
into the country, or in the land. (T.) Ru-beh<br>\
uses the phrase دوّى بِهَا as signifying He passed<br>\
by them; meaning, by them, a male [wild] ass<br>\
and his she-asses. (T.) And it is said of the<br>\
دَوِّيَّة that it is thus called لِأَنَّهَا تُدَوِّى صَارَ فِيهَا,<br>\
i. e. Because it makes away with those who are in<br>\
it. (T.)<br>\
-A2-  See also art. دوى.<br>\
دَوٌّ and ↓دَوِّيَّةٌ (T, S, M, K, the latter [erroneously] written in the CK دَوِيَّة) A desert, or<br>\
waterless desert; syn.مَفَازَةٌ, (S, M,) or فَلَاةٌ; (K;)<br>\
as also ↓ دَوِّىٌّ (S) and ↓ دَاوِيِّةٌ, (S, M, K,) in<br>\
which the first و which is quiescent, [in دَوِّيِّةٌ, for<br>\
دَوْوِيَّةٌ,] is changed into ا because of the fet-hah<br>\
before it, though this instance is not to be copied<br>\
as a model, (S,) and ↓دَاوِيَةٌ: (M, K:) or دَوٌّ<br>\
signifies a wide فَلَاة: (M:) or a level land; likened<br>\
by Dhu-r-Rummeh to the hand of the purchaser,<br>\
meaning when he strikes his hand upon that of<br>\
another in token of the ratification of a bargain:<br>\
and ↓دَوِّيَّةٌ, a land of which the extremities are<br>\
far apart, level, and spacious; said to be so<br>\
called because of the sound termed دَوِىّ that is<br>\
heard in it; [and if so, these two words (the<br>\
latter of which is also mentioned in art. دوى)<br>\
belong to one and the same art.;] or because it<br>\
makes away with those who are in it; [see 2,<br>\
above;] and ↓دَاوِيَّةٌ and ↓دَاوِيَةٌ signify the same:<br>\
(T:) it is also said that دَوٌّ is [in origin] a Pers.<br>\
word; as though he who traversed the دَوّ said to<br>\
his companion دَوْدَوْ, meaning “ Hasten: ”<br>\
(TA:) or, as some say, a certain region, four<br>\
nights&#39; journey in extent, like a shield, vacant,<br>\
traversed by means of the stars, in which one<br>\
feared losing his way, on the way from El-Basrah<br>\
to Mekkeh, was named الدَّوُّ for this reason, from<br>\
the Persians&#39; hastening one another while crossing<br>\
it by saying دَوْدَوْ. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] بَنَاتُ الدَّوِّ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The wild asses. (T in art. بنى.)<br>\
دَوِّىٌّ [a rel. n. from دَوٌّ;] One inhabiting a دَوّ.<br>\
(S.) [Hence the saying,] مَا بِهَا دَوِّىٌّ, (S, K, TA,<br>\
[in the CK, erroneously, دَوِىٌّ,]) and ↓, دُوِّىٌّ (Sgh,<br>\
K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, دُوِىٌّ,]) and<br>\
↓دُوْوِىٌّ, as in the M, or ↓دَوَوِىٌّ, as in the K,<br>\
(TA,) i. e. [There is not in it (meaning بِالدَّارِ in<br>\
the house)] any one (S, M, K) of those who<br>\
inhabit the دَوّ: like as one says مَا بِهَا طُورِىٌّ, and<br>\
دُورِىٌّ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See دَوٌّ, with which it is also<br>\
syn. (S.)<br>\
