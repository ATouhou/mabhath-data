مُدَاعَكَةٌ [app. The act of contending, disputing, or litigating, vehemently: (see مُدَاعِكٌ,<br>\

names no authority,) the act of conflicting, or<br>\
contending; as though rubbing against another.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also] The delaying with another, deferring<br>\
with him, or putting him off, by repeated promises. (Z, TA.) You say, داعك الغَرِيمَ He delayed, or deferred, with the creditor, or put him<br>\

of that Lexicon آلَةُ; for he has explained مِدْعَكٌ,<br>\
as on the authority of the K, by “ Instrumentum<br>\
quo quid defricatur aut levigatur; ” a meaning<br>\
which it may possibly have, as agreeable with<br>\
analogy, but for which I find no authority.]<br>\
