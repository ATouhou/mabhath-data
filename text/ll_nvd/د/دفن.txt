or beneath layers, or strata, of earth, or dust;<br>\
(Msb;) namely, a thing; (S, Msb;) primarily<br>\
having for its object a dead body: (M:) and<br>\
↓ دفّنهُ signifies the same; [but app. in an intensive sense or applying to a number of objects;]<br>\
(M, TT;) or ↓ اِدَّفَنَهُ, of the measure اِفْتَعَلَهُ. (K.<br>\
[So too, accord. to the TA, in the M; but in the<br>\
text of the M as given in the TT, دفّنهُ.]) One<br>\
says to a man who is obscure, unnoted, or of no<br>\
reputation, دَفَنْتَ نَفْسَكَ فِىحَيَاتِكَ (tropical:)  [Thou hast<br>\
buried thyself in thy lifetime]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\

(M, TA.) And دَفَنْتُ الحَدِيثَ (assumed tropical:)  I hid or concealed, the information, or news, &amp;c. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence also, دَفَنَ الرَّكِيَّةَ He filled up, stopped<br>\
up, or choked up, with earth or dust, the well.]<br>\
And دَفَنْتُ عُيُونَ المِيَاهِ I stopped up the sources of<br>\
the waters; syn. عَوَّرْتُهَا, and سَدَدْتُهَا. (Sh, TA in<br>\

-A2-  دَفَنَتْ, aor.<br>\
دَفِنَ, inf. n. دَفْنٌ, said of a<br>\
she-camel, She went her own way, or at random,<br>\
or heedlessly, (M, K,) without need: (M:) or it<br>\
signifies, (M,) or signifies also, (K,) she was, or<br>\
became, (M, K,) usually, (K,) in the midst of the<br>\
other camels when they came to water: (M, K:)<br>\
and ↓ اِدَّفَنَتْ, (En-Nadr, T, TA,) of the measure<br>\

TA;) i. e. she absented, or hid, herself from the<br>\
other camels: or went her own way, at random,<br>\
or heedlessly, alone. (En-Nadr, T.)<br>\

6<br>\
التَّدَافُنُ signifies المَوْتَى ↓ مُدَافَنَةُ [i. e. The<br>\
cooperating in the burying of the dead]. (TA.)<br>\
لَا يَكَادُ النَّاسُ يَتَدَافَنُونَ [The people can hardly, or<br>\
cannot nearly, bury one another] is said in the<br>\
case of a quick and spreading death. (TA voce<br>\
ذَرِيغٌ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] تَدَافَنُوا (tropical:)  They practised concealment, one with another; syn. تَكَاتَمُوا. (S, K,<br>\
TA.) It is said in a trad., لَوْ تَكَاشَفْتُمْ لَمَا تَدَافَنْتُمْ<br>\
(tropical:)  [If ye revealed, one to another his faults, or his<br>\
secrets, ye would not practise concealment, one<br>\
with another, in any case]; meaning, if the fault,<br>\
(عَيْب, as in my copies of the S and in the TA in<br>\
the present art.,) or secret or secrets, (غَيْب, as in<br>\
one of my copies of the S in art. كشف,) of each<br>\
one of you were open, or revealed, to each other<br>\
of you: (S, TA:) or, accord. to IAth, [if ye<br>\
revealed, one to another his secrets, ye would not<br>\
bury one another; for he says that] the meaning<br>\
is, if each one of you knew what is concealed in<br>\
the mind of each other of you, the conducting of<br>\
his funeral, and his burial, would be deemed<br>\
onerous. (TA in art. كشف.)<br>\
7<br>\
اندفن It was, or became, buried, or interred;<br>\
i. e., hidden, concealed, or covered, (S, * M, Msb,<br>\
K, TA,) in the earth, or dust, (TA,) or beneath<br>\
layers, or strata of earth, or dust: (Msb:) and<br>\
↓ اِدَّفَنَ, of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ, signifies the same;<br>\
(S;) or ↓ تدفّن. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, said of a<br>\
portion of a well, (S,) or of a well [absolutely],<br>\
and of a watering-trough or tank, and of a water-ing-place, or spring to which camels came to<br>\
water, (M, K, TA,) [and] so ↓ ادّفن, (T,) [It was,<br>\
or became, filled up, stopped up, or choked up,<br>\
with earth or dust; (see 1, of which each of these<br>\
verbs is a quasi-pass.;) or] it had the dust swept<br>\
into it by the wind [so that it became filled up,<br>\
stopped up, or choked up]. (T, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِدَّفَنَ, of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ: see 7, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, said of a slave, He ran away<br>\
[given without any addition as one of the explanations in the S] before arriving at the city [or<br>\
place] in which he was to be sold: (T, M, K:)<br>\
this is not a running away (إِبَاق) for which he is<br>\
to be returned [to the seller]: so says Yezeed Ibn-Hároon: but he adds that if he arrive there and<br>\
run away, he is to be returned for it, though he<br>\
do not absent himself from that city [or place]:<br>\
(T:) or he absented himself, (T,) or stole away,<br>\
(S, M, Mgh,) from his owners [or owner] for a<br>\
day or two days, (T, S, M, Mgh,) as AZ says,<br>\
(T, S,) or, (T, M,) as AO says, (T, S,) without<br>\
absenting himself from the city [or place in which<br>\
he was sold]; (T, S, M, Mgh;) as though he<br>\
buried himself in the houses of that city [or place]<br>\
in fear of punishment for an offence that he had<br>\
committed: (Mgh:) thus, agreeably with the explanations of AZ and AO, the verb is used by the<br>\
Arabs: (A&#39;Obeyd, T:) and the epithet ↓ دَفُونٌ,<br>\
applied to a slave, means one who does as is described above; (K;) or who is wont to do so: (T,<br>\
S, M, Mgh:) or the verb signifies he fled from<br>\
his owner, or from hard, or severe, work, but did<br>\
not go forth from the town, or the like; and the<br>\
doing so is not a fault [for which he may be<br>\
returned to the seller], for it is not termed إِبَاق.<br>\

used as a sing., applied to land (أَرْضٌ). (TA.<br>\
