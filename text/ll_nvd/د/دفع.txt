دَفَعَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
دَفَعَ, (K,) inf. n. دَفْعٌ<br>\
(Msb, K) and دَفَاعٌ (TA) and مَدْفَعٌ, (K,) [He<br>\
impelled it, pushed it, thrust it, or drove it; and<br>\
particularly, so as to remove it from its place;<br>\
he propelled it; he repelled, or repulsed, it; he<br>\
pushed it, thrust it, or drove it, away, or back;]<br>\
he put it away, or removed it from its place,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) by, or with, force, or strength: (TA:)<br>\
or دَفْعٌ signifies the putting away or removing or<br>\
turning back a thing before the coming or arriving [of that thing]; like as رَفْعٌ signifies the<br>\
“ putting away or removing or turning back ”<br>\
a thing “ after the coming or arriving ” thereof.<br>\
(Kull p. 185.) Hence the saying in the Kur<br>\
[ii. 252, and xxii. 41], وَلَوْ لَا دَفْعُ اللّٰهِ النَّاسَ [And<br>\
were it not for God&#39;s repelling men]; where<br>\
some read ↓ دِفَاعُ [which means the same, as will<br>\
be seen in the course of what follows, though<br>\
bearing also another interpretation, likewise to be<br>\
seen in what follows]. (TA.) You say, دَفَعْتُ<br>\
الرَّجُلَ [I impelled, pushed, &amp;c., the man]. (S.)<br>\
And ↓ دافعهُ, inf. n. دِفَاعٌ [and مُدَافَعَةٌ]; and<br>\
↓ دفّعهُ; (TA;) [both, app., accord. to the TA,<br>\
signifying the same; but the latter more properly relates to several objects together, or signifies he impelled it, pushed it, &amp;c., much, or<br>\
vehemently, or often; whereas] مُدَافَعَةٌ (K, TA)<br>\
and دِفَاعٌ (TA) are [often exactly] syn. with دَفْعٌ.<br>\
(K, TA.) Thus, (TA,) you say, as meaning the<br>\
same, عَنْهُ ↓ دافع and دَفَعَ [He repelled from him;<br>\
whence another explanation of these two phrases,<br>\
which see in what follows]. (S, TA.) And hence,<br>\
دَفَعَ اللّٰهُ عَنْكَ المَكْرُوهَ, inf. n. دَفْعٌ, (tropical:)  [May God<br>\
repel, or avert, from thee what is disliked, or<br>\
hated, or evil]: (TA:) and اللّٰهُ عَنْكَ السُّوْءَ ↓ دَافَعَ,<br>\
inf. n. دِفَاعٌ, (tropical:)  [May God repel, or avert, from<br>\
thee evil]. (S, TA.) And دَفَعْتُ عَنْهُ الأَذَى (tropical:)  [I<br>\
repelled, or averted, from him what was hurtful,<br>\
or annoying; as also ↓ دَافَعْتُ]. (Msb, K, TA.)<br>\
Sb mentions, as a saying of the Arabs, اِدْفَعِ الشَّرَّ<br>\
وَلَوْ إِصْبَعًا (tropical:)  [Repel thou, or avert thou, evil, or<br>\
mischief, though but with a finger: the last word<br>\
being in the accus. case by reason of the subaudition of the prep. ب; the meaning being بِإِصْبَعٍ].<br>\
(TA.) [See also an ex. voce دَفُوعٌ.] When<br>\
دَفْعٌ is made trans. by means of عَنْ, [and has<br>\
a single objective complement, a second objective complement is understood, and in general] it<br>\
has the meaning or the act of (assumed tropical:)  Defending; as in<br>\
the Kur [xxii. 39], إِنَّ اللّٰهَ يَدْفَعُ عَنْ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Verily God defendeth those who have believed;<br>\
i. e. repelleth from them aggression and the like];<br>\
(B;) and ↓ يُدَافِعُ, in the same, (K, TA,) accord.<br>\
to another reading, signifies the same; (K, TA;)<br>\
or this latter signifies (assumed tropical:)  defendeth energetically,<br>\
with the energy of him who contendeth for superiority in so doing. (Bd.) And عَنْهُ ↓ دَافَعْتُ signifies [also] (assumed tropical:)  I pleaded, or contended in arguments, in defence of him. (Msb.) [Exceptions<br>\
to the statement cited above form the B will be<br>\
found in what follows in this paragraph; and<br>\
another exception, voce مُدَفَّعٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [In the exs.<br>\
which follow, the verb is used in senses little<br>\
differing, essentially, from those assigned to it in<br>\
the first sentence of this art.] ―<br>\
-b3-  دَفَعْتُ مِنَ الإِنَآءِ<br>\
دَفَْعَةً [I poured forth from the vessel a single<br>\
pouring]: the last word, which is with fet-h, is<br>\
an inf. n. [of un.]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  دَفَعَتِ اللِّبَأَفِى<br>\
ضَرْعِهَا قُبَيْلَ النِّتَاجِ (tropical:)  [She (a ewe, or goat, S, or a<br>\
camel, S, K) infused the first milk into her<br>\
udder, i. e. secreted it therein, a little before<br>\
bringing forth]. (S, K.) And دَفَعَتِ اللَّبَنِ عَلَى<br>\
رَأْسِ وَلَدِهَا لِكَثْرَتِهِ (tropical:)  [She (a ewe or goat, or a<br>\
camel, TA) secreted the milk in her udder when<br>\
about to produce her young, by reason of its<br>\
abundance]; for the milk becomes abundant in<br>\
her udder only when she is about to bring forth:<br>\
the inf. n. [app. the inf. n. of un.] is دَفْعَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
And دَفَعَتْ alone, said of a ewe or goat, signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:) She secreted milk in her udder when about to<br>\
produce the young; expl. by أَضْرَعَتْ عَلَى رَأْسِ<br>\
الوَلَدِ [which see in art. ضرع]. (S, TA.) Accord.<br>\
to En-Nadr, one says دَفَعَتْ بِلَبِنِهَا, and بِاللَّبَنِ,<br>\
when her young is in her belly; but when she<br>\
has brought forth, one does not say دَفَعَتْ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  In the saying, غَشِيِتْنَا سَحَابَةٌ فَدَفَعْنَاهَا إِلَى غَيْرِنَا<br>\
[lit. A cloud overspread us, and we drove it away<br>\
to other persons], meaning (tropical:)  it departed from us<br>\
to other persons, دفعناها is for دَفَعَتْنَا, which<br>\
means دُفِعَتْ عَنَّا [lit. it was driven away from<br>\
us]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  دَفَعَهُ بِحُجَّةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [He refelled him,<br>\
or refuted him, by an argument or the like].<br>\
(MF in art. كفح.) ―<br>\
-b7-  دَفَعْتُ القَوْلَ (assumed tropical:)  I rebutted<br>\
the saying; repelled it by an argument, an allegation, or a proof. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b8-  اِدْفَعْ هٰذَا (tropical:)  Leave<br>\
thou this, sparing him. (As, TA.) [See مُدَفَّعٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b9-  [In several exs. here following, the verb<br>\
resembles اندفع; نَفْسَهُ, or the like, being understood after it.] ―<br>\
-b10-  دَفَعَ المَآءُ [The water poured<br>\
out, or forth, as though it impelled, or propelled,<br>\
itself]: (TA: [where it is followed by وَانْصَبَّ,<br>\
as an explicative adjunct:]) and so السَّيْلُ [the<br>\
torrent]. (ISh.) [See also 6.] And دَفَعَ الوَادِى<br>\
بِالمَآءِ [The valley poured with water]. (TA in<br>\
art. حشك.) ―<br>\
-b11-  دَفَعَ فِى عَدْوِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He pushed, or<br>\
pressed, on, or forward, as though he impelled<br>\
himself, in his running]. (S in art. غور; &amp;c.)<br>\
[See also 7.] ―<br>\
-b12-  دَفَعَ القَوْمُ (assumed tropical:)  The people, or company of men, came at once. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b13-  دَفَعَ إِلَى<br>\
المَكَانِ, (TA,) and دُفِعَ إِلَيْهِ, (Msb, TA,) in the<br>\
pass. form, (Msb,) (tropical:)  He reached, or came to, the<br>\
place. (Msb, TA.) You say also, هٰذَا طَرِيقٌ يَدْفَعُ<br>\
إِلَى مَكَانِ كَذَا (tropical:)  This is a road which reaches to<br>\
such a place. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b14-  دَفَعَ مِنْ عَرَفَاتٍ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
commenced the journey from &#39;Arafát, and impelled and removed himself thence, or impelled<br>\
his she-camel, and urged her to go. (TA, from a<br>\
trad.) And دَفَعْتُ عَنِ المَوْضِعِ (assumed tropical:)  I removed, went,<br>\
went away, or journeyed, from the place. (Msb.)<br>\
[See again 7.] ―<br>\
-b15-  دَفَعَ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He returned.<br>\
(MF.) ―<br>\
-b16-  When دَفْعٌ is made trans. by means<br>\
of إِلَى, it [generally, but not always, as has been<br>\
shown above,] has the meaning of the act of<br>\
Giving, or delivering; as in the Kur [iv. 5],<br>\
فَادْفَعُوا إِلَيْهِمْ أَمْوَالَهُمْ [Then give ye, or deliver ye,<br>\
to them their property]. (B.) You say, دَفَعْتُ<br>\
إِلَىى فُلَانٍ شَيْئًا [I gave, or delivered, to such a one a<br>\
thing]. (S, K. *) And دَفَعْتُ الوَدِيعَةَ إِلَى صَاحِبِهَا I<br>\
restored the deposit to its owner. (Msb.) And<br>\
دَفَعْتُ لَهُ قِطْعَةً مِنَ المَالِ [I gave him a part, or<br>\
portion, of the property]. (S in art. زعب; and<br>\
the like is said in that art. in the K.) And دَفَعَهُ<br>\
[alone] He gave it; syn. أَعْطَاهُ. (Er-Rághib,<br>\
MF.)<br>\
2<br>\
دَفَّعَ see 1; fourth sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  دفّعهُ إِلَى كَذَا<br>\
(tropical:)  He drove him, compelled him, or necessitated him,<br>\
to do, or to have recourse to, such a thing. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  دفّعهُ also signifies He rendered him abject<br>\

[See the pass. part. n., below.] ―<br>\
-b4-  دفّع قَوْسَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
made his bow even. (AHn, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\

him, or repel him; or the pushing, or repelling,<br>\
another, being pushed, or repelled, by him; or the<br>\

[Hence, يُدَافِعُ الأَخْبَثَيْنِ He is striving to suppress<br>\
the urine and ordure: see أَخْبَثُ. And مُدَافَعَةُ<br>\
العَيْشِ The striving to retain life: see 2 in art.<br>\
زلج. ―<br>\
-b2-  But it is often used in the same sense as<br>\
دَفْعٌ:] see the verb and its two inf. ns. in seven<br>\
places in the former half of the first paragraph of<br>\
this article. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  i. q. مُمَاطَلَةٌ: (S, K, TA:)<br>\
in some of the copies of the S, مُطَاوَلَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
You say, دَافَعْتُهُ بِحَقِّهِ, (Jm, TA,) or عَنْ حَقِّهِ,<br>\
(Msb,) (assumed tropical:)  I deferred with him, delayed with him,<br>\
or put him off, in the matter of his right, or due,<br>\
by promising time after time to render it to him;<br>\
[and so repelled him, or strove to repel him, from<br>\

بِحَاجَتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He deferred, delayed, postponed, or put<br>\

6<br>\

or repelled, one another; or pushed against one<br>\
another. (Msb.) You say, تدافعوا فِى الحَرْبِ They<br>\

-b2-  [Hence,] تدافع الكَلَامَانِ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\

each other; conflicted; were mutually repugnant.<br>\

repel, or repulse, every one of them from himself].<br>\
(IDrd, K.)<br>\
7<br>\
اندفع is quasi-pass. of دَفَعَهُ; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
and ↓ تدفّع is quasi-pass. of دفّعهُ; and ↓ تدافع is<br>\
quasi-pass. of دافعهُ: but all three are used in the<br>\
same sense: see 6: (TA:) [the first, however,<br>\
primarily signifies He, or it, became impelled,<br>\
pushed, thrust, or driven; and particularly, so as<br>\
to be removed from his, or its, place; became propelled; became repelled; became impelled, pushed,<br>\
thrust, or driven, away, or back, or onwards;<br>\
became put away, or removed from its place; as<br>\
is implied in the S and K and TA: whereas the<br>\
second, properly, has an intensive signification:<br>\
and the third properly denotes the acting of two<br>\
or more persons or things, or of several parts or<br>\
portions of a thing, against, or upon, one another;<br>\
as is shown by exs. and explanations above:<br>\
though the second and third are often used in the<br>\

though impelled: see 1, which has a similar meaning, particularly in the phrases دَفَعَ المَآءُ, and<br>\
السَّيْلُ, and دَفَعَ فِى عَدْوِهِ, &amp;c.]. ―<br>\

دَفْعَةٌ A single impulsion; a push, a thrust, or<br>\
single act of driving; and particularly, so as to<br>\

دَفُوعٌ and ↓ مِدْفَعٌ [That impels, pushes, thrusts,<br>\
drives, propels, or repels, much, or vehemently:]<br>\

[lii. 8], مَا لَهُ مِنْ دَافِعٍ There shall not be any<br>\
repeller thereof. (Bd.) And in the same [lxx. 2],<br>\
لَيْسَ لَهُ دَافِعٌ There shall not be for it any repeller:<br>\

if you will, you say, هِىَ دَافِعٌ, alone. (TA.)<br>\
دَافِعَةٌ [fem. of دَافِعٌ, q. v.: and, used as a<br>\
subst.,] The lower, or lowest, part of any [water-course such as is called] مَيْثَآء: pl. دَوَافِعُ: this<br>\
latter signifying the lower, or lowest, parts of the<br>\

into the valleys, (ISh,) or where the valleys pour<br>\

signification is An instrument for impelling, propelling, or repelling: and hence it is applied in<br>\
modern Arabic to a cannon: and to an instrument used by midwives for protruding the fœtus.<br>\
