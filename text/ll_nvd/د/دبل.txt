an ulcer that penetrates into the belly: [see also<br>\

side, and discharges internally; the sufferer from<br>\
which seldom recovers: also called ذَاتُ الجَنْبِ:<br>\
(TA in art. جنب:) a large tumour (in Pers.<br>\
وَرَم بُزُرگ). (KL.) [Abu-l-Kásim Ez-Zahráwee<br>\

order to hasten its coming to maturity. (See<br>\
“ Albucasis de Chirurgia,” p. 98, where the word<br>\
is twice written ذبيلة; once, ذبعيلة; and once,<br>\
correctly, دبيلة.) Golius explains دَبْلَةٌ and دُبْلَةٌ<br>\
by “ vomica, apostema,” as on the authority of<br>\
the S and KL; in neither of which do I find<br>\
anything of the kind: nor do I find دَبْلَةٌ even<br>\
mentioned in either of those works.] ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
دِبْلٌ. Hence the saying, دَبَلَتْهُمُ الدُّبَيْلَةُ: see 1, in<br>\
the latter part of the paragraph.<br>\

دبو and دبى<br>\
1<br>\
دَبَى, aor. يَدْبِى, inf. n. دَبْىٌ [and app. also<br>\
دَبًى, q. v. infrà], He walked, or went, gently, or<br>\
in a leisurely manner. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
تَدْبِيَةٌ i. q. صَنْعَةٌ. (K.) You say, دبّاهُ, meaning صَنَعَهُ [He made it, or wrought it; &amp;c.].<br>\
(TK.)<br>\
4<br>\
ادبى, said of the [tree, or shrub, called]<br>\
رِمْث, (S,) or of the عَرْفَج, (M, K,) or of each of<br>\
these, (TA,) It put forth what resembled [the<br>\
young locusts termed] دَبًى; (M, K;) [i. e.] what<br>\
came forth, of its leaves, resembled دَبًى; (S;)<br>\
and thus became fit to be eaten. (S, M.) [See<br>\
أَبْقَلَ and ثَقَّبَ and حَنَطَ; and see also رِمْثٌ, and<br>\
عَرْفَجٌ.]<br>\
دَبًى or دَبًا [sometimes written with ى and<br>\
sometimes with ا] Locusts before they fly: (S:)<br>\
or locusts when they [first] put themselves in<br>\
motion, and become black, before their wings<br>\
grow: in their first state, when they are white,<br>\
they are termed سَرْءٌ: (AO, T:) or the smallest<br>\
of locusts, and of ants: (M, K:) or [locusts]<br>\
after the state of that which is termed سِرْوَةٌ:<br>\
(M:) [see جَرَادٌ:] n. un. دَباةٌ. (S, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
↓ جَآءَ بِدَبَى دُبَىٍّ, (M,) or بِدَبَا دُبَىٍّ, and بِدَبَا دُبَيَّيْنِ,<br>\
(IAar, T, Mj, K,) and ↓ بِدَبَى دُبَيَّانَ and بِدَبَى<br>\
دُبَيَّانٍ, (Th, M,) (assumed tropical:)  He came with, or brought,<br>\
much; and what was good: (M:) he came with,<br>\
or brought, much property or wealth, or many<br>\
cattle: (M, K:) ↓ دُبَىٌّ is a soft tract in EdDahnà, frequented by locusts, which lay their<br>\
eggs therein; (M;) it is a spacious place; so<br>\
that the phrase [جَآءَ بِدَبَى دُبَىٍّ] is as though it<br>\
meant he came with, or brought, property, or<br>\
wealth, or cattle, like the [locusts termed] دبا of<br>\
the spacious place called دبىّ. (T.) J is in error<br>\
as to this phrase: (K, TA:) for it is stated in<br>\
the S, as on the authority of IAar, that one says,<br>\
جَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِدَبَا دَبَا, meaning Such a one came with,<br>\
or brought, property, or wealth, or cattle, like<br>\
the دبا in abundance: and thus it is found in his<br>\
handwriting: and in the Tekmileh it is written,<br>\
as on the same authority, بِدَبَى دَبًى. (TA.)<br>\
Accord. to Abu-l-&#39;Abbás [Th], the [right] phrase<br>\
is ↓ بِدَبَى دُبِىٍّ: and in one place he says that<br>\
↓ دَبىٌّ [thus (for دَبِىٌّ) in the TT as from the T,<br>\
but probably a mistranscription for ↓ دُبَىٌّ,] signifies<br>\
Much property or wealth, or many cattle: and<br>\
accord. to AA, one says, ↓ جَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِدُبَىٌّ, meaning Such a one came with, or brought, property,<br>\
or wealth, or cattle, like the دبا. (T.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A<br>\
gentle, or leisurely, manner of walking or going.<br>\
(K. [See 1.])<br>\
دَبِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph, last<br>\
sentence but one.<br>\
دُبَىٌّ: see دَبًى, in five places.<br>\
دُبَيَّان: see دَبًى.<br>\
دُبًّى: see the next paragraph.<br>\
دُبَّآءٌ The gourd: n. un. with ة: (S, Msb:) it<br>\
is mentioned in this art. by J and Z [and Fei]:<br>\
but accord. to Hr and the K, its proper art. is<br>\
دب [q. v.]: accord. to Az, دبأ, for he says that<br>\
its measure is فُعَّالٌ: (TA:) some allow its being<br>\
written and pronounced ↓ دُبًّى. (TA in art. دب.)<br>\
أَرْضٌ مَدْبَاةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
أَرْضٌ مُدْبِيَةٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ مَدْبَاةٌ (S) A land<br>\
abounding with [the locusts termed] دَبًى or دَبًا.<br>\
(S, M, K.)<br>\
أَرْضٌ مَدْبُوَّةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
أَرْضٌ مَدْبِيَّةٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ مَدْبُوَّةٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
the و being substituted for the ى as interchangeable therewith, (M,) A land of which the herbage<br>\
has been eaten by [the locusts termed] دَبًى or دَبًا.<br>\
(S, M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Accord. to Z, both signify [also]<br>\
A land that produces دُبَّآء, i. e. gourds. (TA in<br>\
art. دب.)<br>\
