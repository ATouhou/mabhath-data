دَمِىَ, (T, S, M, MA, Msb, K,) [held by<br>\
some to be originally دَمِوَ,] like رَضِىَ, (S, K,)<br>\
which is from الرِّضْوَانُ, being thus [with ى]<br>\
because of the kesreh, (S,) [but most hold the<br>\

I struck him, or smote him, so that blood issued<br>\
from him: (S:) [and I made him bloody; for]<br>\
دَمَّاهُ signifies [also] he smeared him, or defiled<br>\

blood. (MA.) Hence the prov., وُلْدُكِ مَنْ دَمَّى<br>\
عَقَبَيْكِ, (M, TA,) Thy son is he who made thy two<br>\
heels to be smeared with blood; (TA in art. ولد;)<br>\

such cases]. (Th, M.) ―<br>\

in art. دوم.)<br>\
-A2-  استدمى غَرِيمَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He acted gently<br>\
with his debtor; as also اِسْتَدَامَهُ: (Fr, M and K<br>\

دَمٌ [Blood;] one of the [four] أَخْلَاط [or<br>\
humours], (M,) well known: (T, M, K:) accord.<br>\
to some, (Msb,) it is originally دَمَوٌ: (S, Msb:)<br>\
or it is originally دَمًى; (Zj, Mbr, S, M, Msb,<br>\
K;) thus in the correct copies of the K; (TA;<br>\
[in some copies دَمْىٌ, and in the CK دَمَىٌ;])<br>\
though deviating from other words of the same<br>\
form in respect of its pl. [which see below];<br>\
(Mbr, S;) as is shown by its dual, (Zj, M,)<br>\
which is دَمَيَانِ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) whereby<br>\
[also] the letter gone from it is shown to be ى;<br>\
(Mbr, S;) but it has also for its dual دَمَانِ;<br>\
(T, M, Msb, K;) and some of the Arabs say<br>\
دَمَوَانِ; (S, M;) in which last, however, [accord.<br>\
to ISd,] the و is substituted for ى, though<br>\
generally و is changed into ى: (M:) and this<br>\
original form is used by a poet, [namely, Hoseyn<br>\
Ibn-El-Homám, accord. to one of my copies of<br>\
the S,] in his saying,<br>\
فَلَسْنَا عَلَى الأَعْقَابِ تَدْمَى كُلُومُنَا<br>\
↓ وَلٰكِنْ عَلَى أَقْدَامِنَا يَقْطُرُ الدَّمَى<br>\
[And we have not our wounds bleeding upon the<br>\
heels; but upon our feet the blood drops]: (S:)<br>\
or it is originally دَمْىٌ; (Sb, T, S, M, Msb;) as<br>\
is shown by its pls., (Sb, S,) which are دِمَآءُ (Sb,<br>\
T, S, M, K) and دُمِىٌّ, (Sb, S, M, K,) also pronounced دِمِىٌّ; (TA;) like as ظَبْىٌ and دَلْوٌ have<br>\
for their pls. ظِبَآءُ and ظُبِىٌّ and دِلَآءٌ and دُلِىٌّ; for<br>\
if it were like قَفًا and عَصًا, it would not have such<br>\
pls. (Sb, S.) دَمٌّ is ignored by Ks; but is used<br>\
by poetic license; (M;) or it is a dial. var. of دَمٌ.<br>\
(K in art. دم.) ↓ دَمَةٌ has a more special signification than دَمٌ, the two words being like بَيَاضَةٌ<br>\
and بَيَاضٌ; (S;) [i. e.] it signifies A portion of<br>\
blood: (T, M, K:) or it is a dial. var. of دَمٌ, (M,<br>\
K,) accord. to IJ. (M.) The dim. of دَمٌ is<br>\
↓ دُمَىٌّ. (S.) [Hence,] رَجُلٌ ذُو دَمٍ A man<br>\
seeking to obtain, or prosecuting for, [the revenge<br>\
of] blood. (TA.) دَمُ فُلَانٍ فِى ثَوْبِ فُلَانٍ is a<br>\
saying of the Arabs, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is the<br>\
slayer of such a one. (Ham p. 632.) الدَّمُ الدَّمُ<br>\
وَالهَدْمُ الهَدْمُ, or وَالهَدَمَ الهَدَمَ, is a saying of the<br>\
Arabs, meaning If thy blood be sought, my blood<br>\
shall be sought; and if thy blood go for nought,<br>\
my blood shall go for nought: or, accord. to the<br>\
latter reading, as is said in the Nh, and where<br>\
thou shalt be buried, I will be buried: or thine<br>\
abode shall be mine abode. (JM in art. هدم,<br>\
q. v.) See also an ex. voce دُمْيَةٌ. ―<br>\

see دَمٌ.<br>\
دَمٍ Bleeding; having blood issuing from it:<br>\
(S, * Msb:) [and] bloody; i. e. smeared, or defiled,<br>\
with blood: and ↓ دَامٍ signifies the same [in both<br>\
senses]. (MA.)<br>\
دُمْيَةٌ An image, or effigy, (S, M, Mgh, K,)<br>\
of ivory and the like, (S,) or of marble, (M, K,)<br>\
variegated, decorated, embellished, or coloured,<br>\
(M, Mgh, K,) in which is redness like blood:<br>\
(Mgh:) or an image, or effigy, in a general<br>\
sense: (Kr, M, K:) accord. to Abu-I-&#39;Alà, because originally painted with red, as though from<br>\
الدَّمُ: and any beautiful female is likened thereto,<br>\
because adorned: (TA:) metonymically applied<br>\
to (tropical:)  a woman: (IAar, T:) or anything that is<br>\
deemed beautiful in respect of whiteness: (TA:)<br>\
and an idol: (Lth, S, K:) said in the R to be so<br>\
called because of the shedding of blood at the<br>\
place thereof for the purpose of propitiation; but<br>\
MF says that this derivation requires consideration: more probably because it is decorated:<br>\
(TA:) pl. دُمًى. (S, Mgh, K.) Accord. to MF,<br>\
it is also pronounced ↓ دِمْيَةٌ. (TA.) One says,<br>\
أَحْسَنُ مِنَ الدُّمْيَةِ, meaning More beautiful than<br>\
the image of ivory. (Har p. 611.) And لَاوَ الدُّمَى<br>\
is an oath of the Pagan Arabs, meaning No, by<br>\
