upon it. (Mgh, K. *) [Accord. to another explanation, mentioned in the TA, the blackness<br>\
denoted by this phrase is behind the ear: but<br>\

على طَرَفٍ مِنْهُ [app. I am beside, or out of, the<br>\

دَسَمٌ a word of well-known meaning; (S;)<br>\
i. q. وَدَكٌ; (M, K;) both signifying Grease, or<br>\
gravy; i. e. the dripping that exudes from flesh-meat and from fat; (Msb in art. ودك;) the وَدَك<br>\
of flesh-meat and of fat: (Mgh: [in the CK,<br>\
الوَرَكُ is erroneously put for الوَدَكُ:]) or, accord.<br>\
to the T, anything that has وَدَك, of flesh-meat<br>\
and of fat: (TA:) and dirt, or filth: (M, K:)<br>\
and ↓ دَسْمٌ signifies the same as دَسَمٌ, accord. to<br>\
El-Kurtubee; but El-Welee El-&#39;Irákee says, I<br>\
have not seen this on the authority of any other<br>\
lexicologist. (TA.) You say, يَدُهُ مِنَ الدَّسَمِ سَلِطَةٌ<br>\
[app. meaning, if correctly transcribed, His hand<br>\
is hard by reason of dirt adhering to it: in my<br>\
MS. copy of the K, the last word is written<br>\
سَطِلَةٌ; a word which I do not find in any sense:<br>\
in the TK, سطلة: this Freytag thinks to be the<br>\
right reading, though I know of no such word;<br>\
and he renders the phrase, “manus ejus propter<br>\
sordes inhaerentes catinus est; ” evidently assuming that سطلة is a dial. var. of سَطْلٌ]. (K.)<br>\
[It seems that you say also, مَا فِيهِ دَسَمٌ meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  There is not in him, or it, any profit, or good:<br>\
a sense assigned in the TA to the phrase ما فيه<br>\
ديسم دسم; in which I think it evident that the<br>\
transcriber has written ديسم by mistake, and<br>\
forgotten to erase it after adding دسم.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
The bowels, or intestines. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Accord. to<br>\
IAar, it means also كَثِيرُ الذِّكْرِ [Praising, or<br>\
glorifying, God, much]; a sense in which it is<br>\
incorrectly said in the K to be ↓ دَسِيمٌ, like أَمِيرٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and hence the trad., of weak authority,<br>\
لَا يَذْكُرُونَ اللّٰهَ إِلَّا دَسَمًا: (K:) or, accord. to Z,<br>\
this is from دَسَمَ said of rain: and, as related by<br>\
Abu-d-Dardà, the words are أَرَضِيتُمْ إِنْ شَبِعْتُمْ<br>\
عَامًا أَلَّا تَذْكُرُونَ اللّٰهَ إِلَّا دَسَمًا, meaning [Do ye<br>\
approve, if ye be satisfied in your stomachs<br>\
throughout a year,] that ye should not praise, or<br>\
glorify, God, save a little? (TA:) or it may<br>\
denote commendation; so that the meaning of<br>\
لا يذكرون اللّٰه الّا دسمًا is, that praise, or glorification, is the stuffing of their hearts and of their<br>\
mouths: and it may denote discommendation;<br>\
as meaning that they praise, or glorify, little;<br>\
from تَدْسِيمُ نُونَةِ الصَّبِىِّ; (K, TA;) the blackness<br>\
denoted by this phrase being small in quantity:<br>\
or, as some say, the meaning is, that they do not<br>\
praise, or glorify, God for anything but eating,<br>\
and the grease, or gravy, in their insides. (TA.)<br>\
دَسِمٌ A thing greasy; or having in it, or upon<br>\
it, grease or gravy, (M, Mgh,) of flesh-meat or<br>\
of fat: (Mgh:) [and dirty, or filthy: pl. دُسْمٌ;<br>\
like as ذُرْبٌ is pl. of ذَرِبٌ.] You say مَرَقَةٌ دَسِمَةٌ<br>\
[Greasy broth]. (TA.) And ثِيَابٌ دُسْمٌ, Dirty,<br>\
or filthy, garments. (S, TA.) And دَسِمَ الثَّوْبِ,<br>\
applied to a man, [Dirty in the garment: and<br>\
hence, going on foot;] not riding; as also ↓ أَدْسَمُ<br>\
الثَّوْبِ. (TA.) [Hence also,] (assumed tropical:)  Defiled by culpable dispositions. (TA.) A rájiz says,<br>\
لَاهُمَّ إِنَّ عَامِرَ بْنَ جَهْمِ<br>\
أَوْذَمَ حَجًّا فِى ثِيَابٍ دُسْمِ<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [O God, verily &#39;Ámir Ibn-Jahm]<br>\
hath imposed upon himself, (S in art. وذم,) or<br>\
hath performed, (M,) pilgrimage being defiled by<br>\
sins. (S in art. وذم, and M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عِمَامَةٌ دَسِمَةٌ signifies A black turban; (TA;) as also عمامة<br>\
↓ دَسْمَآءُ. (Az, Mgh, TA.) And دَسِمٌ occurs in a<br>\
trad. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Strict, or pious, [though]<br>\
black, (أَسْوَدُ, [or this may here mean a genuine<br>\
Arab, as opposed to أَحْمَرُ meaning a foreigner,])<br>\
and religious. (TA.)<br>\
أُمُّ دَسْمَة [probably a mistranscription for أُمُّ<br>\
↓ دُسْمَةٍ, lit. “ the mother of blackness; ”] (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
cooking-pot. (T in art. ام.)<br>\
-A2-  آخِرُ دَسْمَةٍ i. q.<br>\
آخِرُ عَهْدٍ [The last time]; like آخِرُ مَخْطَرٍ. (TA<br>\
in art. خطر. [See خَطْرَةٌ, last sentence.])<br>\
دُسْمَةٌ A thing with which a hole in a skin for<br>\
water or milk is stopped up. (M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Blackness; (IAar, TA;) [and] so ↓ دَيْسَمٌ: (K:) or<br>\
dust-colour inclining to blackness. (M, K.) Hence<br>\
the Abyssinian is called أَبُو دُسْمَةٍ. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
See also أُمُّ دَسْمَة, above.<br>\
-A3-  Applied to a man,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Low, or ignoble; base; vile; mean, or sordid:<br>\
(S, TA:) or bad, corrupt, base, or vile. (M, K.<br>\
[Freytag erroneously assigns the meaning “ vilis ”<br>\
to أَدْسَمُ.]) One says, مَا أَنْتَ إِلَّا دُسْمَةٌ (tropical:)  Thou<br>\
art none other than one in whom is no good.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
دِسَامٌ A stopper; (M, K;) a thing with which<br>\
one stops up the ear, and a wound, and the like,<br>\
and the head of a flask or bottle, and the like.<br>\
(S.) It is said in a trad. that the Devil has a<br>\
دِسَام; meaning that he has a stopper by which<br>\
he prevents one from seeing the truth (M, TA)<br>\
and from keeping in mind admonition. (TA.)<br>\
دَسِيمٌ: see دَسَمٌ.<br>\
دَاسِمٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
دَيْسَمٌ Darkness. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also دُسْمَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  The fox: (K:) [or] the young one of the<br>\
fox: (M:) or, as some say, (M,) the young one<br>\
of the fox from the bitch: (M, K:) and (so in<br>\
the M, but in the K “ or ”) of the wolf from the<br>\
bitch: (S, M, K:) and the bear: (K:) or the<br>\
young one of the bear; (S, M, K;) which is the<br>\
only meaning allowed by Abu-l-Ghowth. (S.)<br>\
Also, (K,) or as some say, (M,) The young one<br>\
of the bee. (M, K.) And, accord. to Abu-lFet-h, (TA,) whose name was دَيْسَمٌ, (K, * TA,)<br>\
the companion of Kutrub, A [young ant, such as<br>\
is termed] ذَرَّةٌ: (TA:) or ↓ دَيْسَمَةٌ [in the CK<br>\
erroneously written دَسَمَة] has this last signification. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also A certain plant, (S,<br>\
K, KL,) called in Pers. بستان افروز [which is<br>\
said to be a name applied to the amaranth,<br>\

dust-colour inclining to blackness: (M, K:) fem.<br>\
as above. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Freytag assigns to it also<br>\
the significations “ Multum pinguis ” and “ Oleo<br>\
conspurcatus; ” both as on the authority of the<br>\
K, in which I do not find either of them: also<br>\
that of “ Vilis,” as applied to a man; a signification belonging to دُسْمَةٌ.]<br>\
