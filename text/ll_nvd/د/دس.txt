دَسَّهُ, (S, M, A, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
دَسُ3َ, (M, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. دَسٌّ (M, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and دَسِّيسَى,<br>\
(K,) like خِصِّيصَى, (TA,) He hid it, or concealed it, (Lth, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) namely, anything, (A, Mgh, Msb,) in the earth or dust, (S,<br>\
Mgh,) or beneath a thing: (A, Mgh:) he buried<br>\
it (A, Msb, K) in the earth or dust, (Msb,) or<br>\
beneath a thing: (K:) or he put it in, or inserted it, beneath: (M:) or, accord. to some, he<br>\
put it in, or inserted it, with force; he thrust it in:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ دَسَّسَهُ and ↓ دَسَّاهُ, (M, K, *) in the<br>\
latter of which one of the س is changed<br>\
into ى because the reduplication is disliked, (M, *<br>\
TA,) signify the same as دَسَّهُ, (M, K, *) [or,<br>\
probably, have an intensive signification.] It is<br>\
said in the Kur [xvi. 61], أَمْ يَدُسُّهُ التُّرَابِ<br>\
Or whether he shall bury it in the dust: meaning,<br>\
his female child, which he buried alive: the<br>\
pronoun agreeing with the word ما [which precedes in the same verse]. (T, TA.) It is also said<br>\
in the Kur [xci. 9 and 10], قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ زَكَّاهَا وَقَدْ<br>\
↓ خَابَ مَنْ دَسَّاهَا, (M, K, *) in which دسّاها is for<br>\
↓ دَسَّسَهَا, like تَظَنَّيْتُ for تَظَنَّنْتُ, (K,) because the<br>\
niggardly conceals his place of sojourning and<br>\
his property, but the liberal makes his place of<br>\
sojourning upon an open and elevated spot that<br>\
he may not be concealed from guests and those<br>\
who desire to come to him: (Fr, Zj, K: *) or the<br>\
meaning is, He is successful who maketh it<br>\
(namely his soul) pure and believing, and he is<br>\
unsuccessful who introduceth it among the good<br>\
when he is not of them: (IAar, Th, M, K: *) or<br>\
[he is successful who maketh it to increase in<br>\
grace by good works,] and he is unsuccessful who<br>\
maketh it vile and little by evil works: (M:) or<br>\
the latter clause means, and he is unsuccessful<br>\
who hideth it, and maketh it obscure and of no<br>\
reputation, by the neglect of almsgiving and of<br>\
obedience [to God in other matters]: (TA:) or<br>\
the soul is unsuccessful that God rendereth obscure [so I render, here, دسّاها]. (Fr, K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
دَسَّ البَعِيرَ, aor.<br>\
دَسُ3َ, inf. n. دَسٌّ, He anointed the<br>\
camel with tar, not thoroughly, [but only in the<br>\
arm-pits, and the inner parts of the roots of the<br>\
thighs or other similar parts:] (M:) [for it is<br>\
said that] دُسَّ البَعِيرُ signifies the camel was<br>\
anointed with tar in the parts called the مَسَاعِر:<br>\
(S: [see دَجَلَ:]) or the latter signifies the camel<br>\
became swollen in the parts so called. (M.)<br>\
Hence the prov., لَيْسَ الهَنْءُ بِالدَّسِّ [which see<br>\
explained in art. هنأ]. (TA in art. هنأ. [In the<br>\
S and M and TA, in the present art., instead of<br>\
الهَنْءُ, we find الهِنَآءُ: but the former is the preferable reading.])<br>\

دَسَّسَهُ and<br>\
دَسَّاهُ: see دَسَّهُ; each in two<br>\
places.<br>\

اندسّ [He, or it, became hidden, or concealed, in the earth or dust, or beneath a thing:<br>\
he, or it, hid, or concealed, himself, or itself, in<br>\
the earth &amp;c.:] he, or it, became buried: he, or<br>\
it, buried himself, or itself: (S, K:) or it became<br>\
put in, or inserted, or it put in, or inserted, itself,<br>\
beneath. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اندسّ فُلَانٌ إِلَى فُلَانٍ<br>\
يَأْتِيهِ بِالنَّمَائِمِ (tropical:)  [Such a one came secretly to such<br>\
a one, bringing him calumnies]: (TA:) or اندسّ<br>\
الى فلان means (assumed tropical:)  he came to such a one with<br>\
calumnies. (Ham p. 219.)<br>\
دَسٌّ Tar with which the arm-pits, and the<br>\
inner parts of the roots of the thighs or other<br>\
similar parts, of camels, are anointed. (TA.)<br>\
دَسِيسٌ The concealment of guile or artifice.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
-A2-  One whom thou hidest, or concealest,<br>\
(مَنْ تَدُسُّهُ,) in order that he may bring thee<br>\
news, or information: (M, K:) accord. to some,<br>\
similar to مُتَحَسِّسٌ; (M;) or مُتَجَسِّسٌ; and<br>\
called by the vulgar ↓ دَاسُوسٌ: (TA:) or دَسِيسُ<br>\
قَوْمٍ signifies one whom a people send secretly to<br>\
bring them news, or information; (A;) the spy<br>\
of a people, who searches for, and then brings,<br>\
news, or information; syn. جَاسُوس. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And دُسُسٌ [pl. of دَسِيسٌ] Persons hypocritical in<br>\
their actions, who enter among the reciters of the<br>\
Kur-án when they are not of them. (IAar, K.)<br>\
دَسِيسَةٌ [app. The coming secretly to a person,<br>\
bringing him calumnies: in modern Arabic, a<br>\
secret machination or the like]. (TA, where,<br>\
after the phrase اندسّ فلان الى فلان يأتيه<br>\
بالنمائم, (see 7,) it is added, وَهِىَّ الدَّسِيسَةٌ.)<br>\
دَسَّاسٌ That enters much, or often; wont to<br>\
enter; syn. دَخَّالٌ: so in the saying, العِرْقُ دَسَّاسٌ<br>\
[The natural disposition is wont to enter and<br>\
actuate him in whom it is engendered: generally<br>\
applied to him who has some fault derived from<br>\
his mother, or the like; as is said in a marginal<br>\
note in my copy of the TA: see عِرْقٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
دَاسُوسٌ: see دَسِيسٌ.<br>\
مَدْسُوسٌ, applied to a camel: part. n. of دُسَّ<br>\
