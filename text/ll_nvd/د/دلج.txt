دَلَجَ, (S, L, K,) aor.<br>\
دَلُجَ (S, L) and<br>\
دَلِجَ, (L,)<br>\
inf. n. دُلُوجٌ, He transferred the bucket from the<br>\
mouth of the well to the watering-trough, to<br>\
empty it therein: (S, K:) or he took the bucket,<br>\
when it came forth, and went with it whithersoever he pleased. (TA.) One says also, هُوَ يَدْلُجُ<br>\
بِالدَّلْوِ and يَدْجُلُ بِهَا: the latter verb being formed<br>\
by transposition. (Fr, TA in art. دجل.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
He transferred the milk, when the camels had<br>\
been milked, to the [large bowls called] جِفَان.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\

ادلج, (inf. n. إِدْلَاجٌ, Msb, TA,) He journeyed from the beginning of the night: and<br>\
↓ اِدَّلَجَ he journeyed from the latter part of the<br>\
night: (Th, S, K:) or the former signifies he<br>\
journeyed all the night: and ↓ the latter, he<br>\
journeyed in the latter part of the night: (A,<br>\
Msb, TA:) or the former, he journeyed in the<br>\
night, at any hour from the beginning to the<br>\
end thereof: (Th, from Aboo-Suleymán ElAarábee:) or, accord. to El-Fárisee, ↓ both these<br>\
verbs are syn., and each bears the first and second<br>\
of the significations given above: IDrst contends<br>\
against the assertions of those who make a difference between them, and affirms them to be syn.,<br>\
and to signify he journeyed in the night, at any<br>\
time, in the beginning or middle or end thereof:<br>\
therefore, he says, their signification is restricted,<br>\
in several examples, by the context; and hence,<br>\
he adds, the appellation مُدْلِجٌ given to a hedgehog: (TA:) [agreeably with this explanation,]<br>\
&#39;Alee says,<br>\
اِصْبِرْ عَلَى السَّيْرِ وَالإِدْلَاجِ فِى السَّحَرِ<br>\
[Endure thou with patience travelling, and journeying in the night, in the period a little before<br>\
daybreak]. (MF.) [See another ex. voce أَصْبَحَ.]<br>\

the first and second, (TA,) a journeying all the<br>\

journeying a little before daybreak: (ISd, TA:)<br>\
or the first and second (TA) and third (IDrst,<br>\
TA) a journeying in the night; and this seems<br>\
to be the meaning intended in the trad., عَلَيْكُمْ<br>\
بِالدُّلْجَةِ فَإِنَّ الأَرْضَ تُطْوَى بِاللَّيْلِ [Keep ye to<br>\
journeying in the night, for the earth is to be<br>\
traversed by night]: (TA:) [and ↓ دَلِيجٌ occurs<br>\
in the L in the sense of دُلْجَةٌ &amp;c.:] the pl. of<br>\
the first is دُلَجٌ. (Ham p. 521.) One says also,<br>\
الدُّلْجَةَ قَبْلَ البُلْجَةِ [Keep to the journeying in<br>\
the night, &amp;c., before the breaking of the dawn].<br>\
