mentioned by El-Ahmar; (T;) and compared<br>\

radical letter sometimes ن and sometimes an<br>\
infirm letter and sometimes elided, to لَدُنْ and<br>\
لَدَا and لَدْ; the second like قَفًا and عَصًا, and the<br>\
third like يَدٌ, (T, TA,) and by some written دَدٌّ,<br>\
with teshdeed; (TA; [but it is there implied<br>\
that this is of doubtful authority;]) and the second<br>\
and third said by some to be formed from the<br>\
first, by the change of ن into ا and by the elision<br>\
of ن; (TA;) Diversion, sport, play, or such as<br>\
is vain, or frivolous; (T, S, K;) as also دَيْدٌ,<br>\
[which should be mentioned in art. ديد,] and<br>\

contr. significations: (K:) or, accord. to Th, a<br>\
sword with which trees are cut; called by others<br>\
مِعْضَدٌ; and this is not necessarily the contr. of a<br>\
blunt sword. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, applied to a man,<br>\
[perhaps from the first of the significations mentioned above,] meaning لَاغَنَآءَ عِنْدَهُ [Not having,<br>\
or not possessing, what suffices; or not profitable<br>\
to any one]. (Fr, S, K.)<br>\
