without teshdeed, and is an imitative sequent to<br>\
حاجة: (S:) [see art. دوج:] but accord. to one<br>\
relation, it is ما تركت حَاجَّةٌ وَلَا دَاجَّةٌ, meaning,<br>\
accord. to El-Khattábee, [I left not a company<br>\
of] pilgrims to Mekkeh, nor those returning.<br>\
(TA.) One says also, أَمَا وَحَوَاجِّ بَيْتِ اللّٰهِ وَ دَوَاجِّهِ<br>\
لَأَفْعَلَنَّ كَذَا وَكَذَا [Nay, by the pilgrims to the<br>\
