دَحْرَجَ, inf. n. دَحْرَجَةٌ and دِحْرَاجٌ, (S, L,<br>\
K,) [He rolled a thing along: and] he rolled a<br>\
thing down. (L, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And He rounded a thing;<br>\
made it round: see the pass. part. n., below.]<br>\
Q. 2<br>\
تَدَحْرَجَ quasi-pass. of Q. 1; (S, L, K;)<br>\
[It (a thing) rolled along: and] it rolled down.<br>\
(L, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And It became round.]<br>\
دُحْرُوجَةٌ The little ball [of dung] that is rolled<br>\
along by the جُعَل [or species of black beetle<br>\
called cantharus, and in which it deposits its<br>\
eggs]: (S, K:) pl. دَحَارِيجُ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It also signifies ما تدحرج من القدر: [so in the L and TA:<br>\
but the following verse, cited as an ex. of this<br>\
signification, suggests that القدر is probably a<br>\
mistranscription for القُرْدِ or القُرُدِ, i. e. “ ticks; ”<br>\
to which, in several different stages of growth,<br>\
the Arabs apply different appellations: (see<br>\
حَمْنَانٌ:) and this is rendered more probable by<br>\
the fact that, in the L, د and ر are often written<br>\
almost exactly alike: if so, the meaning is (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
round tick; or a tick that has become round:<br>\
likened, I suppose, to the little ball of dung<br>\
above mentioned:] pl. as above: En-Nábighah<br>\
says,<br>\
أَضْحَتُ يُنَفِّرُهَا الوِلْدَانُ مِنْ سَبَأٍ<br>\
كَأَنَّهُمْ تَحْتَ دَفَّيْهَا دَحَارِيجُ<br>\
[app. describing a she-camel, and meaning, She<br>\
became so that the children of Seba scared her<br>\
away, as though they were round ticks biting her<br>\
beneath her two sides]. (L, TA. [This verse is<br>\
also cited in the M and TA in art. سبأ; but not<br>\
there explained.])<br>\
مُدَحْرَجٌ pass. part. n. of Q. 1 [as meaning<br>\
Rolled along: and rolled down]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And]<br>\
Rounded; or round; syn. مُدَوَّرٌ. (S, K.)<br>\
المُدَحْرِجُ [The roller; meaning] the جُعَل [or<br>\
species of black beetle mentioned above, voce<br>\
دُحْرُوجَةٌ]. (IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  هَالِبُ الشَّعْرِ and مُدَحْرِجُ<br>\
البَعْرِ are [Two] days of winter. (K in art.<br>\
هلب.)<br>\
