دَغَرَ, aor.<br>\
دَغَرَ, (K,) inf. n. دَغْرٌ, (S, A, K,) He<br>\
pushed, thrust, drove, impelled, or repelled. (S,<br>\
A, K.) This is the primary signification. (S, A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  دَغَرَهُ, aor. as above, He pressed him, or<br>\
squeezed him, until he died. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  دَغَرَتْ حَلْقَ<br>\
الصَّبِىّ, (TK,) aor.<br>\
دَغَرَ, (K,) inf. n. دَغْرٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
She pressed the throat, or fauces, of the child,<br>\
(K, * TA,) on account of the pain termed العُذْرَةُ,<br>\
(S, * TA,) and (or that is to say, TA) raised his<br>\
uvula with her finger, (S, K, TA,) compressing<br>\
that part on the occasion of the pain&#39;s being excited by the blood. (A &#39;Obeyd, TA.) So in the<br>\
trad., عَلَامَ تُعَذِّبْنَ أَوْلَادَكُنَّ بِالدَّغْرِ Wherefore do<br>\
ye torment your children by raising the uvula<br>\
&amp;c.: (S:) and لَا تُعَذِّبْنَ أَوْلَادَكُنَّ بِالدَّغْرِ Torment ye not your children by pressing the throat,<br>\
or fauces, &amp;c. (A &#39;Obeyd, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And دَغَرَتْ<br>\
وَلَدَهَا, (TK,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (K,) She<br>\
fed her child ill: and she suckled him without<br>\
satisfying him, (K,) so that he remained hungry,<br>\
and applied himself to every one he met, and ate<br>\
and sucked, and would suck the dug of a ewe or<br>\
goat: and the like is said of a she-camel with<br>\
respect to her young one, accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed<br>\
Es-Sukkaree, who thus explains the latter of the<br>\
two traditions quoted above; but Az says that<br>\
the right explanation is that given by A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
as is shown in the traditions [elsewhere]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  دَغَرَ الشَّىْءَ بِالشَّىْءِ, (TK,) aor . and inf. n. as<br>\
above, (K,) He mixed the thing with the thing.<br>\
(K, * TK.)<br>\
-A2-  دَغَرَ عَلَيْهِ, (K,) aor.<br>\
دَغَرَ, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
دَغْرٌ, (K,) and ↓ دَغْرَى, (K, TA,) or the latter is<br>\
a simple subst., (TA,) He rushed upon him without consideration; (K, TA;) he charged upon<br>\
him. (TA.) Hence the saying, لَاصَفَّى ↓ دَغْرَى,<br>\
(S, A, K, *) and ↓ دَغَرَى, and ↓ دَغْرَآءَ, (K,) and<br>\
دَغْرًا لَا صَفًّا, (S, K,) like عَقْرَى وَحَلْقَى, and عَقْرًا<br>\
وَحَلْقًا, (S,) i. e., Rush ye upon them without<br>\
consideration, and oppose them not in regular<br>\
ranks: (S, * A, * K, * TA:) or mix ye among<br>\
them, &amp;c. (Kr.) A woman is related to have said<br>\
to her son, وَلَا صَفَّى ↓ إِذَا رَأَتِ العَيْنُ العَيْنَ فَدَغْرَى<br>\
When the eye sees the eye, [or when eye meets<br>\
eye in war,] then rush thou &amp;c. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  دَغَرَ فِى<br>\
البَيْتِ He entered the house: (K:) as though he<br>\
thrust himself in. (TA.)<br>\
اِدَّغَرَ: see 8 in art. ثغر.)<br>\
دَغْرٌ (TA) and ↓ دَغْرَةٌ (S, A, K) The act of<br>\
snatching a thing unawares; seizing it hastily<br>\
when its owner is unawares: (S, A, K:) or the<br>\
springing, or rushing, upon a commodity, to<br>\
snatch it unawares: or the filling one&#39;s hand<br>\
with a thing and carrying it off. (TA.) Hence<br>\
the trad. (S, A) of &#39;Alee, (TA,) ↓ لَاقَطْعَ فِى الدَّغْرَةِ<br>\
[There shall be no amputation of the hand for<br>\
snatching a thing unawares: &amp;c.]. (S, A, TA.)<br>\
دَغْرَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
دَغْرَى and دَغَرَى and دَغْرَآء: see 1; the first, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
مَدْغَرَةٌ A fierce war, in which the word is دَغْرَى,<br>\
(K,) or دَغْرًا. (TA.)<br>\
