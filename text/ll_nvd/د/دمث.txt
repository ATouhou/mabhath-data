دَمِثَ, (S, M, A, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
دَمَثَ, (S, A, Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. دَمَثٌ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb,) sometimes<br>\
contracted into دَمَثٌ, (Msb,) It (a place, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K, or other thing, A, K) was, or<br>\
became, soft and even: (M, A, Mgh, Msb, K:)<br>\
or it (a place) was, or became, soft and sandy.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And دمث, (Msb,) [i. e. دَمُثَ, or دَمِثَ as<br>\
above,] inf. n. دَمَاثَةٌ (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K)<br>\
and دُمُوثَةٌ (M, TA) and دَمَثٌ, (A,) or دَمْثٌ,<br>\
(Mgh,) (tropical:)  He (a man) was, or became, easy in<br>\
nature, or disposition. (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
دمّثهُ, (T, M, A, Msb,) inf. n. تَدْمِيثٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) He made it even, (T, A,) or soft, (S, K,)<br>\
or soft and even; (Msb;) namely, a place, (T,<br>\
A, Msb,) or a bed, or place on which to lie: (S:)<br>\
and (A) he macerated it, namely, a thing, and<br>\
mashed it, (M, A,) with his hand, (A,) in order<br>\
that it might become soft. (M, A.) [Hence,]<br>\
دَمِّثْ لِجَنْبِكَ قَبْلَ اللَّيْلِ مُضْطَجَعَا<br>\
(T,) or قَبْلَ النَّوْمِ, (A,) [lit. Make soft and even<br>\
for thy side a bed, or place on which to lie, before<br>\
night, or before sleeping;] a prov., meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  prepare for an event before its happening.<br>\
(T, * A.) [Hence also,] مَنْ كَذَبَ عَلَىَّ فَإِنَّمَا<br>\
يُدَمِّثُ مَجْلِسَهُ مِنَ النَّارِ, i. e. [Whoso lieth against<br>\
me, verily] he will make even, meaning will<br>\
prepare, his sitting-place in the fire [of Hell];<br>\
a saying of Mohammad. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,]<br>\
دمّث الحَدِيثَ, (T, A,) inf. n. as above, (K,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
mentioned (T, A, K) the beginning of (T, A)<br>\
the tradition, or story. (T, A, K.) You say,<br>\
دَمِّثْ لِى ذٰلِكَ الحَدِيثَ حَتَّى أَطْعُنَ فِى خَوْضِهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  Mention thou to me the beginning of that<br>\
tradition, or story, in order that I may know<br>\
the manner thereof (T, A) and how I should<br>\
enter upon it [so that I may push on in it].<br>\
(A.)<br>\
4<br>\
مَا كَانَ أَدْمَثَ فُلَانًا وَأْلْيَنَهُ (tropical:)  How easy in<br>\
nature, or disposition, was such a one! [and how<br>\
gentle was he!]. (S, TA.)<br>\
دَمْثٌ: see دمِثٌ, in two places.<br>\
دَمَثٌ: see the next paragraph, in three places.<br>\
دَمِثٌ Even, or soft; applied to a valley, and<br>\
to anything: (T:) or a place soft and even;<br>\
(Mgh, TA;) as also ↓ دَمِيثٌ, (A,) and ↓ دَمْثٌ, or<br>\
↓ دَمَثٌ; the last also explained as a subst.,<br>\
meaning an even, or a soft, tract of land; app.<br>\
an inf. n. used as a subst.: (Mgh:) or دَمِثٌ [in<br>\
one copy of the S erroneously written دِمِثٌ, and<br>\
in another دِمْثٌ,] signifies a soft and sandy<br>\
place; and its pl. is دِمَاثٌ: (S:) or a place soft to<br>\
the tread; as also ↓ دَمَثٌ: and so this last applied<br>\
to a tract of sand (رَمْلَةٌ); as though it were an<br>\
inf. n. used as an اِسْم [here meaning an epithet;<br>\
wherefore it is used alike as masc. and fem. and<br>\
sing. and dual and pl.]: and [for this reason]<br>\
↓ دَمَثٌ signifies also plain, or soft, tracts of land;<br>\
pl. [of pauc.] أَدْمَاثٌ and [of mult.] دِمَاثٌ: (M:)<br>\
or دِمَاثٌ has this last meaning; and its sing. is<br>\
↓ دَمِثَةٌ [with ة added to transfer the word from<br>\
the category of epithets to that of substantives];<br>\
and دِمَاث consist of sands and of what are not<br>\
sands: دَمَائِثُ likewise is applied to what is [or<br>\
are] even and soft; and its sing. is ↓ دَمِثَةٌ [like as<br>\
خَرِبَةٌ is sing. of خَرَائِبُ]: (T: [but for دَمِثَةٌ, in<br>\
this last instance, I find ↓ دَمِيثَةٌ: if this be right,<br>\
the pl. is agreeable with analogy; but if دَمِثَةٌ be<br>\
the sing., the pl. is anomalous:]) and دَمِثٌ is<br>\
applied to sand, as meaning not cohering. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., مَالَ إِلَى دَمِثٍ فَبَالَ فِيهِ,<br>\
(Mgh,) or ↓ دَمْثٍ, (A, Mgh,) accord. to different<br>\
readings, i. e. [He turned to] a soft and even<br>\
place [and made water upon it]. (Mgh.) And<br>\
you say, ↓ نَزَلْنَا بِأَرْضٍ مَيْثَآءَ دَمْثَآءَ [We alighted, or<br>\
alighted and abode, in a tract of land even, or soft,<br>\
or soft and even]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (T,) (tropical:)  A man<br>\
easy in nature, or disposition, (T, M, TA,) and<br>\
generous; (T;) as also ↓ دَمِيثٌ: (TA:) and in<br>\
the same sense ↓ دَمِيثَةٌ is applied to a woman;<br>\
(T;) or دَمِثَةٌ; (TA;) she being likened to land<br>\
so termed, because such is the best, or most<br>\
productive, of land. (T, TA.) And دَمِثُ<br>\
الأَخْلَاقِ (tropical:)  A man easy in natural dispositions.<br>\
(A.)<br>\
