K written دَدّ, and said in the TA, in art ددن, to<br>\
be so written by some, though it is there implied<br>\
that this is of doubtful authority,]) without tesh-deed, (A, TA,) like يَدٌ, (MF,) Diversion, sport,<br>\
play, or such as is vain, or frivolous; (S, A, K;)<br>\
as also دَدًا, like قَفًا; and دَدنٌ, (S, K,) and ↓ دَدَدٌ:<br>\
(Ed-Demámeenee, CK:) but accord. to IB, it<br>\
should be mentioned in art. ددن [in which دَدَنٌ<br>\
is mentioned again in the S and K], or art. ددو<br>\
[in which دَدًا is mentioned again together with<br>\
دَدٌ and دَدَنٌ]. (L.) [The proper place of دَدٌ<br>\
seems to be art. ددو (like as art. اخو is the proper<br>\
place in which أَخٌ should be mentioned), as well<br>\
as of دَدًا; and the proper place of دَدَنٌ, art.<br>\
ددن.] Hence, (A,) مَا أَنَا مِنْ دَدٍ وَلَا الدَّدُ مِنِّى [I<br>\
have no concern with diversion, &amp;c., nor has diversion, &amp;c., any concern with me]: a saying [of<br>\
Mohammad] occurring in a trad. (S, A.)<br>\

دَدَدٌ: see above.<br>\
دَدِدٌ [meaning Diverting himself, sporting, playing, or doing so in a vain, or frivolous, manner,]<br>\
occurs [accord. to one reading] in a verse of Et-<br>\
Tirimmáh [cited in this art. in the K, and in the<br>\
present work in art. طرب, as an ex. of اِسْتَطْرَبَ]:<br>\
the poet has annexed to it a third د because an<br>\
epithet is not susceptible of variation unless comprising three letters: (K:) or such is the opinion<br>\
of F; but this requires consideration. (MF.)<br>\
