دَنَّ: see R. Q. 1, in four places.<br>\
-A2-  [دَنِنَ is<br>\
mentioned by Golius and Freytag (by the<br>\
former as from the S) as though it were the verb<br>\
of which دَنَنٌ (q. v.) is the inf. n.; but I find no<br>\
authority for it: and if دَنَنٌ have a verb, it<br>\
should, accord. to rule, be دَنَّ, aor. يَدَنُّ.]<br>\
2<br>\
دَنَّ3َ see R. Q. 1.<br>\
4<br>\
ادنّ, (T, K,) inf. n. إِدْنَانٌ, (T, TA,) He<br>\
(a man, T, TA) remained, stayed, abode, or dwelt,<br>\
(T, K, TA,) [as though set in the ground like a<br>\
دَنّ,] بَالمَكَانِ in the place; like أَبَنَّ: (T, TA:)<br>\
on the authority of Aboo-Turáb, (T,) or Ibn-ElFaraj. (TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
دَنْدَنَ It buzzed, or made a buzzing<br>\
sound; syn. صَوَّتَ, and طَنَّ, (K,) and طَنْطَنَ;<br>\
(Sh, T, TA;) as also ↓ دَنَّ, and ↓ دنّن; said of<br>\
the fly, (K,) [and of the bee, and of the hornet,<br>\
and the like; for] دَنْدَنَةٌ [inf. n. of دَنْدَنَ] (Lth,<br>\
T, M, K) and دَنِينٌ [inf. n. of ↓ دَنَّ] (Lth, T,<br>\
M) and ↓ دِنْدِنٌ [a simple subst.] (M) signify<br>\
the buzzing (صَوْت, Lth, T, M, K) of the fly,<br>\
(M, K,) or the bee, (Lth, T,) and the hornet,<br>\
(Lth, T, M, K,) and the like. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[hence,] He (a man) spoke in a low, gentle, or<br>\
soft, tone, so that his speech was not understood;<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, K, TA;) [as also ↓ دَنَّ; for] دَنْدَنَةٌ<br>\
[inf. n. of the former] (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, K)<br>\
and دَنِينٌ [inf. n. of ↓ دَنَّ] and ↓ دِنْدِنٌ (M, K)<br>\
signify the speaking in a low, gentle, or soft, tone,<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, T, S,) or in the manner termed<br>\
هَيْنَمَةٌ, (M, K,) so that the speech is not understood:<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, M:) or دَنْدَنَةٌ signifies [merely]<br>\
the speaking in a low, or faint, tone: (M:)<br>\
accord. to IAth, it is a little above what is termed<br>\
هَيْنَمَةٌ. (TA.) A poet says,<br>\
نُدَنْدِنُ مَثْلَ دَنْدَنَةِ الذُّبَابِ<br>\
[We buzz in our speech like the buzzing of the<br>\
fly]. (Sh, T.) And it is said in a trad., حَوْلَهَا<br>\
نُدَنْدِنُ, (S,) or حَوْلَهُمَا, (M, JM, TA,) which is<br>\
thus explained: the Prophet asked an Arab of the<br>\
desert, “What dost thou say in the تَشَهُّد? ” [see<br>\
this word, which means the repetition of a form<br>\
of words at the close of the ordinary prayers:]<br>\
and he answered, “I ask of God Paradise, and<br>\
seek protection of Him from the fire [of Hell]:<br>\
but as to thy دَنْدَنَة and the دَنْدَنَة of Mo&#39;ádh, I<br>\
do not approve it: ” and the Prophet said,<br>\
حَوْلَهُمَا نُدَنْدِنُ; (M, JM; *) i. e. [We speak with<br>\
a low, or faint, voice] about those two things,<br>\
namely, the seeking Paradise and the praying for<br>\
protection from the fire [of Hell]; and on account<br>\
of them: (JM:) accord. to some, it is from<br>\
دَنْدَنَ حَوْلَ المَآءِ He went round about the water:<br>\
[hence it may mean we utter our prayer respecting<br>\
them with a low, or faint, sound, as though we<br>\
were buzzing round about them like flies; seeking<br>\
to enter the one, and to keep outside the other:]<br>\
As says that it may be from the signification of<br>\
the sound [of buzzing], or from that of going<br>\
round about: (TA:) or, accord. to one relation,<br>\
the Prophet said, عَنْهُمَا نُدَنْدِنُ [From a consideration of them we utter our prayer with a<br>\
low, or faint, voice;] i. e. our دَنْدَنَةُ arises from<br>\
them; and is because of them: and hence, (JM,)<br>\
دَنْدَنَ means also He (a man, JM) went to and<br>\
fro in one place. (JM, TA.)<br>\
دَنٌّ A wine-jar: (MA:) a [jar of the kind<br>\
called] حُبّ: (S:) or [a jar] in form like a حُبّ:<br>\
(Msb:) or a large رَاقُود [or earthen jar, smeared<br>\
inside with pitch, long in the lower part], (M,<br>\
K,) in form like the حُبّ, (M,) but taller; (M;<br>\
in the K, or taller than the حُبّ;) uniform in<br>\
make, [tapering to the bottom,] having at the<br>\
lower end what resembles the قَوْنَس [or tapering<br>\
top] of a helmet: (M:) or smaller than the<br>\
حُبّ, having a pointed lower extremity, [so I<br>\
render عُسْعُسٌ, (agreeably with the TK,) regarding it as a dial. var., or perhaps a mistranscription, of عُصْعُصٌ, which properly signifies the<br>\
“ os coccygis,”] (M, K,) so that (M) it will not<br>\
sit [upright] without one&#39;s digging a hole for it:<br>\
(M, K:) IDrd says that it is a genuine Arabic<br>\
word: (M:) pl. [of mult.] دِنَانٌ (T, S, M, Msb)<br>\
[and دِنَنَةٌ and (of pauc.) أَدْنُنٌ and أَدُنٌّ, as appears<br>\
from the following saying of IAar, quoted by Az:]<br>\
one says دَنٌّ and أَدْنُنٌ and أَدُنٌّ and دِنَانٌ and<br>\
دِنَنَةٌ. (T.) [See an ex. in a verse of El-Aashà<br>\
cited voce اِرْتِسَامٌ.]<br>\
دَنَنٌ A bending, or curving, in the back [so<br>\
that it resembles a دَنّ: see أَدَنُّ]: (M, K:) and<br>\
a nearness [to the ground] in the neck and breast,<br>\
(M, K,) and a stooping, (M,) and lowness,<br>\
therein, (M, K,) by original natural constitution:<br>\
it is in a man, (M,) and in a horse or the like,<br>\
and any quadruped: (M, K:) or shortness, and<br>\
lowness, or depression, of the neck: (R, TA:) or,<br>\
in a horse, shortness of the fore legs: or, accord.<br>\
to As, in any quadruped, nearness of the breast to<br>\
the ground; which is one of the worst of faults:<br>\
(S:) or, accord. to AZ, in a camel, a leaning<br>\
forward, with shortness of the fore legs: and,<br>\
accord. to AHeyth, in a horse or similar beast,<br>\
shortness of the fore legs, and a consequent nearness of the neck to the ground. (T.)<br>\
دِنَّةٌ A certain insect resembling an ant: (K:)<br>\
so called because of its shortness. (TA.)<br>\
دِنِّيَّةٌ The [kind of cap called] قَلَنْسُوَة, of a<br>\
Kádee; likened to a دَنّ; (K;) a قلنسوة worn by<br>\
Kádees, as though so called in relation to the<br>\
دَنّ, because high and round: (Har p. 109:)<br>\
accord. to Esh-Shereeshee, originally دَنِينَةٌ; a<br>\
قلنسوة pointed at the extremity, [in my original<br>\
الاطراف is erroneously put for الطَّرَف,] worn by<br>\
Kádees and great men: not a genuine Arabic<br>\
word, but of the dial. of El-&#39;Irák. (TA.)<br>\
دِنْدِنٌ syn. with دَنْدَنَةٌ: see R. Q. 1, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
-A2-  Also Herbage (S, M, K) and trees,<br>\
(M, K,) or dry herbage, (As, T,) become black,<br>\
(As, T, S, K,) or wasted and black, (M,) by<br>\
reason of oldness: (As, T, S:) or what is broken<br>\
in pieces of [the species of barley-grass called]<br>\
بُهْمَى, when it has become black and old: or the<br>\
stems (أُصُول) of old and wasted trees: (M:)<br>\
accord. to Lth, the stems (اصول) of trees: but<br>\
the right explanation is that given above on the<br>\
authority of As. (T.)<br>\
دَنَادِنُ The ذَلَاذِل [or lower parts, that are next<br>\
the ground,] of garments. (K.)<br>\
أَدَنُّ One whose back resembles the دَنّ; (IAar,<br>\
T;) [i. e.] having a bending, or curving, in the<br>\
back; (S, M, K;) applied to a man; (S;)<br>\
hump-backed: (Fr, TA in art. عجر:) and having<br>\
the neck and breast near [to the ground], (M, K,)<br>\
and stooping, (M,) and low, (M, K,) by original<br>\
natural constitution: applied to a man, (M,) and<br>\
to a horse or the like, and any quadruped: (M,<br>\
K:) or, applied to a horse, short in the fore legs:<br>\
(S:) or, applied to a camel, leaning forward,<br>\
with shortness of the fore legs: (AZ, T:) or,<br>\
applied to a horse or the like, short in the fore<br>\
legs, and consequently having his neck near to the<br>\
ground: (AHeyth, T:) As said that no أَدَنّ ever<br>\
outstripped except that of the Benoo-Yarbooa:<br>\
(M:) fem. دَنَّآءُ. (M, K.) [See also دَنَنٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, applied to a house, or chamber, or tent,<br>\
(بَيْت, [for which Golius appears to have read<br>\
نَبْت,]) Low, or depressed, [app. in its roof.]<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
