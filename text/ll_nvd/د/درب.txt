5<br>\
تدرّب quasi-pass. of 2: (Msb:) see 1.<br>\
دَرْبٌ is not a word of Arabic origin: (Msb:)<br>\
الدَّرْبٌ is [the Arabic name of the ancient Derbe,<br>\
near the Cilician Gates, which were the chief<br>\
mountain-pass, from the direction of the countries<br>\
occupied by the Arabs, into the territory of the<br>\
Greek Empire: these “ Gates ” are mentioned<br>\
by El-Idreesee as fortified, and guarded by troops<br>\
who watched the persons going and coming:]<br>\
a well-known place in الرُّوم [or the territory of<br>\
the Greek Empire], mentioned by Imra-el-Keys,<br>\
[as El-Idreesee also says,] in the words,<br>\
بَكَى صَاحِبِى لَمَّا رَأَى الدَّرْبَ حَوْلَهُ<br>\
[My companion wept when he saw the درب<br>\
around him; knowing himself to be in the power<br>\
of the Greeks]. (MF, TA.) [Hence,] Any place<br>\
of entrance, (Kh, T, M, A, Mgh [in my copy of<br>\
which it is written دَرَب in all its senses], K,) or<br>\
a narrow pass, (Mgh,) to [the territory of]<br>\
الرُّوم: (Kh, T, M, A, Mgh, K:) or such as is<br>\
not open at both ends: such as is open at both<br>\
ends being called ↓ دَرَبٌ: (K:) or a place of<br>\
entrance between two mountains: (Msb:) or a<br>\
narrow pass in mountains: and hence it has<br>\
another meaning well known: (S:) [i. e.] the<br>\
gate of a سِكَّة [here meaning street: misunderstood by Golius, who has consequently explained<br>\
دَرْبٌ as having, for one of its meaning, “porta<br>\
ingressusve palmeti ”]; used in this sense by the<br>\
Arabs because it [i. e. the درب properly so called]<br>\
is like a gate, or entrance, to that whereto it<br>\
leads: (Msb:) or the gate of a wide سِكَّة: (T:)<br>\
or a wide gate of a سِكَّة; and the largest gate;<br>\
(M, K;) both of which explanations mean the<br>\
same: (M:) and also a wide سِكَّة itself: so in the<br>\
phrase, زُقَاقٌ أَوْ دَرْبٌ غَيْرُ نَافِذٍ [a narrow street or a<br>\
wide street not being a thoroughfare]: (Mgh: [in<br>\
my copy of which, دَرَبٌ is put for دَرْبٌ:]) [but in<br>\
the present day, and as used by El-Makreezee<br>\
and others, a by-street, whether wide or narrow,<br>\
branching off from a great street, or passing<br>\
through a حَارَة (or quarter), open, or having a<br>\
gate, at each end:] pl. دُرُوبٌ (Kh, T, M, Mgh,<br>\
TA) and دِرَابٌ. (Sb, K. [The former pl., the<br>\
only one commonly known, is not mentioned<br>\
in the K.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A place in which dates are<br>\
put to dry. (M, K.)<br>\
دَرَبٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
دَرِبٌ [part. n. of دَرِبَ]. You say, هُوَ دَرِبٌ بِهِ<br>\
[He is accustomed, or habituated, to it; attached,<br>\
addicted, given, or devoted, to it; and bold to do<br>\
it, or undertake it: and] he knows it, has knowledge of it, or is knowing in it. (A, TA.) And<br>\
some use ↓ دَارِبٌ as part. n. of دَرِبَ: (Msb:) it<br>\
signifies Skilful in his handicraft: (IAar, T,<br>\
Msb:) and with ة, intelligent: (IAar, T, K:)<br>\
and skilful in her handicraft: (K:) and [hence]<br>\
a female drummer. (IAar, T, K.) And عُقَابٌ<br>\
↓ دَارِبٌ (M) or عُقَابٌ دَارِبٌ عَلَى الصَّيْدِ (K) means<br>\
دَرِبَةٌ (K) or دَرِبَةٌ بِالصَّيْدِ (M) [An eagle accustomed, or habituated, or trained, to the chase;<br>\
and bold to practise it].<br>\
دُرْبَةٌ Custom, or habit; (IAar, T, S, M, A, K;)<br>\
or habituation; (T, Msb;) and boldness to engage<br>\
in, or undertake, war, and any affair: (IAar,<br>\
T, S, A, * Msb, * K:) and ↓ دُرَّابَةٌ, (M, TA,) with<br>\
teshdeed, (TA,) on the authority of IAar, (M,<br>\
TA,) but written in the K ↓ دُرَابَة, (TA,) signifies the same. (M, K, TA.) One says, مَا زِلْتُ<br>\
أَعْفُو عَنْ فُلَانٍ حَتَّى اتَّخَذَهَا دُرْبَةً [I ceased not to<br>\
forgive such a one until he took it as a habit].<br>\
(T, * S.)<br>\
دَرَبُوتٌ (Lh, M, K [in the CK دَرَبُوبٌ]) and<br>\
↓ دَرُوبٌ, (K,) the former like تَرَبُوتٌ, in which the<br>\
[initial] ت is [said to be] a substitute for د, (Lh,<br>\
M,) A he-camel, (M, K,) or such as is termed<br>\
بَكْرٌ, (Lh, M,) and a she-camel, (Lh, M, K,) submissive, or tractable, (M, K,) or rendered submissive or tractable: and a she-camel that will<br>\
follow a person if he takes hold of her lip or her<br>\
eyelash. (Lh, M, K. [But I read بِهُدْبِ عَيْنِهَا, as<br>\
in the explanation of تَرَبُوتٌ in the TA, instead of<br>\
نَهَزْتَ عَيْنَهَا in the M and CK in this art., and<br>\
نَهَزَتْ عَيْنُهَا in my MS. copy of the K. See also<br>\
تَرَبُوتٌ.])<br>\
