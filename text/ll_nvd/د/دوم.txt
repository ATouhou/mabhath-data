دَامَ, aor. يَدُومُ and يَدَامُ; (S, M, Msb, K;)<br>\
the see. pers. of the pret. when the aor. is يَدُومُ<br>\
being دُمْتَ; and when the aor. is يَدَام, دِمْتَ;<br>\
(M;) and accord. to Kr, (M,) you say also<br>\
دِمْتَ, aor. تَدُومُ, which is extr., (M, K,) and not<br>\
of valid authority, held by the lexicologists [in<br>\
general] to be anomalous like مِتَّ having for its<br>\
aor. تَمُوتُ, and فَضِلَ of which the aor. is يَفْضُلُ,<br>\
and حَضِرَ of which the aor. is يَحْضُرُ, and said by<br>\
Aboo-Bekr to be a compound of the pret. of which<br>\
the aor. is تَدَامُ with the aor. of which the pret. is<br>\
دُمْتَ; (M;) inf. n. دَوْمٌ and دَوَامٌ [which is the<br>\
most common form] and دَيْمُومَةٌ [originally<br>\
دَيْوَمُومَةٌ, like قَيْدُودَةٌ originally قَيْوَدُودَةٌ, &amp;c.];<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K;) i. q. ثَبَتَ [as meaning It (a<br>\
thing, S, M, Msb) continued, lasted, endured, or<br>\
remained]: (Msb, TK:) and it became extended,<br>\
or prolonged; syn. اِمْتَدَّ: (TK:) and [it continued,<br>\
lasted, endured, or remained, long;] its time was,<br>\
or became, long: (TA:) and i. q. بَقِىَ [as syn.<br>\
with ثَبَتَ (explained above) and as meaning it<br>\
continued, lasted, or existed, incessantly, always,<br>\
endlessly, or for ever; it was, or became, permanent, perpetual, or everlasting]: (Msb in art.<br>\
بقى:) and ↓ استدام signifies the same as دام [in<br>\
all of these senses]: (TA:) [but Mtr says,]<br>\
استدام السَّفَرُ [The journey continued, or continued<br>\
long,] is not of established authority. (Mgh.)<br>\
[Hence, دَامَ مُلْكُهُ May his dominion be of long<br>\
continuance.] And دام عَلَى الأَمْرِ; (MA;) and<br>\
عَلَيْهِ ↓ داوم, [and ↓ داومهُ, as is shown by a usage<br>\
of the act. part. n. in art. دمن in the S, &amp;c.,]<br>\
(S, * MA,) inf. n. مُدَاوَمَةٌ; (S;) He kept continually, or constantly, to the thing, or affair.<br>\
(S, MA.) مَا دَامَ means Continuance; because ما<br>\
is a conjunct noun to دام; and it is not used<br>\
otherwise than adverbially, like as inf. ns. are<br>\
used adverbially: you say, لَا أَجْلِسُ مَا دُمْتَ قَائِمًا,<br>\
i. e., دَوَامَ قِيَامِكَ [I will not sit during the continuance of thy standing]; (S, TA;) [or as long<br>\
as thou standest; or while thou standest; for]<br>\
ما denotes time; and قُمْ مَا دَامَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا means<br>\
مُدَّةَ قِيَامِ زَيْدٍ [i. e. Stand thou during the period of<br>\
Zeyd&#39;s standing]. (Ibn-Keysán, TA.) [And<br>\
عَلَىالدَّوَامِ means Continually, or constantly;<br>\
like دَائِمًا.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Said of rain, it means It fell, or<br>\
descended, consecutively, continuously, or constantly. (Msb.) Some say, (M,) دَامَتِ السَّمَآءُ,<br>\
aor. تَدِيمٌ, inf. n. دَيْمٌ, (M, K,) which, if correct,<br>\
should be included in art. ديم, (M,) meaning The<br>\
sky rained continually; as also ↓ دَوَّمَت and<br>\
دَيَّمَت, (M, K,) in which last the و is changed into<br>\
ى as it is in دِيمَةٌ, (M,) and ↓ ادامت: (K:) or<br>\
rained such rain as is termed دِيمَة; (M in art.<br>\
ديم;) and so ↓ دَيَّمَت, inf. n. تَدْيِيمٌ; (S in art.<br>\
ديم;) and ↓ ادامت. (Z, TA.) [See also دَوْمٌ,<br>\
below.] IAar cites the following verse, (M, TA,)<br>\
by Jahm Ibn-Shibl, (TA in this art.,) or Ibn-Sebel, (TA in art. سبل, in which, also, the verse<br>\
is cited,) in praise of a horse, as is said in “ the<br>\
Book of Plants ” of Ed-Deenäwaree, and in<br>\
“ the Book of Horses ” of Ibn-El-Kelbee, not, as<br>\
J asserts it to be, in praise of a munificent<br>\
man, (TA,)<br>\
هُوَ الجَوَادُ بْنُ الجَوَادِ بْنِ سَبَلْ<br>\
جَادَ وَ إِنْ جَادُوا وَبَلْ ↓ إِنْ دَيَّمُوا<br>\
[He is the fleet, the son of the fleet, the son of<br>\
Sebel (a famous mare): if they are unremitting<br>\
in their running, (the masc. pl. being here used,<br>\
though relating to horses, in like manner as it is<br>\
used in the Kur xli. 20,) he is fleet; and if they<br>\
are fleet, he is vehement in his running]: or, as<br>\
some relate it, إِنْ دَوَّمُوا. (M, TA. [It should be<br>\
observed that the three verbs in this verse, and<br>\
the word سبل, also relate to rain.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  It (a<br>\
thing, T) was, or became, still, or motionless; said<br>\
of water (T, S, * Msb, K, * TA) left in a pool by a<br>\
torrent, and of the boiling of a cooking-pot;<br>\
(Msb;;) and said, in this sense, of the sea: (M:)<br>\
and it stopped, or stood still. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
was, or became, tired, or fatigued: (T, TA:)<br>\
[app. because he who is so stops to rest.] ―<br>\
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
(a thing) went round, revolved, or circled: (T,<br>\
TA:) [app. because that which does so keeps<br>\
near to one place.] دَوَمَانٌ [an inf. n. of دَامَ like<br>\
as حَوَمَانٌ is of حَامَ,] signifies (tropical:)  The circling of a<br>\
bird (K, TA) around water. (TA. [But in my<br>\
MS. copy of the K, and in the CK, in the place<br>\
of الدَّوَمَانُ I find ↓ الدَّوَمَآءُ. See also 2.]) [Hence,]<br>\
دِيمَ بِهِ (tropical:)  He was taken, or affected, with a vertigo,<br>\
or giddiness in the head; as also بِهِ ↓ أُدِيمَ, (M,<br>\
TA,) and ↓ اُسْتُدِيمَ [app., in like manner, followed<br>\
by بِهِ]. (Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  دَامَتِ الدَّلْوِ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
دَوْمٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  The bucket became full: (K:) in<br>\
this meaning, regard is had to the stagnant water<br>\
[in the bucket]. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
دَوَّمَتِ السَّمَآءُ, and دَيَّمَت: and دَيَّمُوا said of<br>\
horses: see 1, in the latter half of the paragraph,<br>\
in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  دوّمت الكِلَابُ The dogs went<br>\
far: (Akh, IAar, M, K:) or continued their<br>\
course. (IAar, M.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says, (de<br>\
scribing a wild bull, T, TA,)<br>\
حَتَّى إِذَا دَوَّمَتْ فِى الأَرْضِ رَاجَعَهُ<br>\
كِبْرٌ وَ لَوْ شَآءَ نَجَّى نَفْسَهُ الهَرَبُ<br>\
[Until, when they went far in the land, pride<br>\
returned to him: but, had he pleased, flight had<br>\
saved his blood: J, however, assigns to the verb<br>\
in this instance another signification, as will be<br>\
seen below]. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  دوّم said of a bird,<br>\
(T, M, K,) inf. n. تَدْوِيمٌ, (T, S,) (tropical:)  It circled<br>\
(Lth, T, S, M, K, TA) in the sky, (Lth, T, M, K,)<br>\
as also ↓ تداوم, (KL,) [or ↓ تَدوّم, (see مُتَدَوِّمَاتٌ,)]<br>\
to rise high towards the sky; (S;) as also ↓ استدام:<br>\
(M, K:) or circled in the sky, (M,) or flew,<br>\
(T, * K,) without moving its wings; (T, M, K;)<br>\
like the kite and the aquiline vulture: (T, TA:)<br>\
or put itself into a state of commotion in its<br>\
flying. (TA. [See also 1, near the end of the<br>\
paragraph.]) Dhu-r-Rummeh makes التَّدْوِيم to be<br>\
on the earth, or ground, in the verse cited above<br>\
in this paragraph; [as though the meaning were,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Until, when they went round &amp;c.;] As disallows<br>\
this, and asserts that one says only دَوَّى فِىالأَرْضِ,<br>\
and دَوَّمَ فِى السَّمَآءِ; but some affirm that التَّدْوِيمُ<br>\
فِىالأَرْضِ is correct; and say that hence is de<br>\
rived ↓ الدُّوَّامَةُ, meaning “ the round thing [or<br>\
top] which the boy throws, and makes to revolve,<br>\
or spin, upon the ground, by means of a string; ”<br>\
though others say that this is so called from the<br>\
phrase دَوَّمْتُ القِدْرَ [explained below], because, by<br>\
reason of the quickness of its revolving, or spinning, it seems as though it were at rest: and<br>\
تَدْوَامٌ is like تَدْوِيمٌ: some, however, say that<br>\
تَدْوِيمُ الكَلْبِ signifies the dog&#39;s going far in flight:<br>\
(S:) AHeyth says that, accord. to As, التَّدْوِيمُ is<br>\
only the act of a bird in the sky: (T, TA:) AAF<br>\
says that, accord. to some, التَّدْوِيمُ is in the sky,<br>\
and التَّدْوِيَةُ is on the earth, or ground; but accord.<br>\
to others, the reverse is the case; and this, he<br>\
says, is the truth in his opinion. (M, TA. [See<br>\
also دَوَّىَ in art. دوى.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  You say also, دَوَّمَتِ,<br>\
الشَّمْسُ, (M, K,) or دوّمت الشمس فى السَّمَاءِ, (T,)<br>\
or فِىكَبِدِ السَّمَآءِ, (S,) i. e. دَارَتْ فِى السَّمَآءِ [or<br>\
دارت فى كبد السماء, lit. (tropical:)  The sun spun in the<br>\
sky, or in the middle of the sky; meaning, was as<br>\
though it were spinning]; (T, M, K;) or was as<br>\
though it were motionless [&amp;c.]: (T, S:) and<br>\
hence is [said to be] derived the word ↓ دُوَّامَةٌ<br>\
applied to the boy&#39;s revolving, or spinning, thing.<br>\
(T.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says, (describing the [insect<br>\
called] جُنْدَب, [generally said to be a species of<br>\
locust,] TA in art. رمض)<br>\
مَعْرَوْرِيًا رَمَضَ الرَّضْرَاضِ يَرْكُضُهُ<br>\
وَالشَّمْسُ حَيْرَى لَهَا فِى الجَوِّ تَدْوِيمُ<br>\
(T, * S, TA) i. e. Venturing upon the [vehement]<br>\
heat of the pebbles, [meaning the vehemently-hot<br>\
pebbles,] striking them with its foot, for so the<br>\
جندب does, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  when the sun is [apparently]<br>\
stationary in the summer midday, [as though<br>\
perplexed in its course,] as though having a spinning [in the region between heaven and earth]:<br>\
(T, TA:) or as though it were motionless. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And one says, دَوَّمَتْ عَيْنُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [His eye rolled;<br>\
i. e.] the black of his eye revolved as though it<br>\
were in the whirl of a spindle. (IAar, M, K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
[دوّم is also trans.] You say, دوّم الدُّوَّامَةَ, (M, K,)<br>\
inf. n. تَدْوِيمٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He made the دوّامة [or top]<br>\
to revolve, or spin [so as to seem to be at rest, as<br>\
has been shown above]: (M, K:) or he played<br>\
with the دوّامة. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And دوّمت الخَمْرُ شَارِبَهَا<br>\
(tropical:)  The wine intoxicated its drinker so as to make<br>\
him turn round about. (As, S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
دَوَّمُوا العَمَائِمَ (assumed tropical:)  They wound the turbans around<br>\
their heads. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And دوّم المَرَقَةَ (assumed tropical:)  He put<br>\
much grease into the broth so that it swam round<br>\
upon it. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  التَّدْوِيمُ [or app. تَدْوِيمُ<br>\
اللِّسَانِ] also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The mumbling the tongue,<br>\
and rolling it about in the mouth, in order that<br>\
the saliva may not dry up: so says Fr. (S, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  [Hence, app., as the context seems to indicate,]<br>\
Dhu-r-Rummeh says, describing a camel braying<br>\
in his شِقْشِقَة [or faucial bag],<br>\
دَوَّمَ فِيهَا رِزَّهُ وَ أَرْعَدَا<br>\
[as though meaning (assumed tropical:)  He made his braying to<br>\
roll, or rumble, in it, and threatened]. (Fr, S,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And دوّم signifies (tropical:)  He moistened a thing.<br>\
(S, M, K.) Ibn-Ahmar says,<br>\
وَقَدْ يُدَوِّمُ رِيقَ الطَّامِعِ الأَمَلُ<br>\
(S, M;) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [And hope sometimes, or often,]<br>\
moistens the saliva [of the eager]: (S:) he is<br>\
praising En-Noamán Ibn-Besheer, and means<br>\
that his hope moistens his saliva in his mouth by<br>\
making his eulogy to continue. (IB.) ―<br>\
-b8-  (tropical:)  He<br>\
mixed, or moistened, or steeped, (دَافَ,) saffron,<br>\
(Lth, T, S, M, K, TA,) and stirred it round in<br>\
doing so: (Lth, T, TA:) he dissolved saffron in<br>\
water, and stirred it round therein. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
دوّم القِدْرَ, and ↓ ادامها, (S, M, K,) He stilled the<br>\
boiling of the cooking-pot by means of some [cold]<br>\
water: (S:) or he sprinkled cold water upon [the<br>\
contents of] the cooking-pot to still its boiling:<br>\
(M, K:) or the former, (K,) or both, (M,) he<br>\
allayed the boiling of the cooking-pot by means of<br>\
something, (M, K,) and stilled it: (M:) and the<br>\
latter signifies he left the cooking-pot upon the<br>\
أَثَافِى [or three stones that supported it], after it<br>\
had been emptied, (Lh, M, K,) not putting it down<br>\
nor kindling a fire beneath it. (Lh, M.)<br>\

it to continue, last, endure, or remain: to be<br>\
extended, or prolonged: to continue, last, endure,<br>\
or remain, long: and to continue, last, or exist,<br>\
incessantly, always, endlessly, or for ever; to be<br>\
permanent, perpetual, or everlasting]: (TK:) he<br>\
did it continually, or perpetually: (MA:) he had<br>\
it continually, or perpetually. (MA, KL.) [Accord. to Golius, followed in this case by Freytag,<br>\
↓ تداوم signifies Perennitate donavit; a signification app. given by Golius as on the authority of<br>\
the KL; but not in my copy of that work.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
ادام القِدْرَ: see 2, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b3-  ادام الدَّلْوَ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
filled the bucket. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  الإِدَامَةٌ also signifies تَنْقِيرُ السَّهْمِ عَلَى الإِبْهَامِ [i. e. The trying the<br>\
sonorific quality of the arrow by turning it round<br>\
upon the thumb: or, as explained in this art. in<br>\
the TK, the making the arrow to produce a sharp<br>\
sound upon the thumb: or rather this or the<br>\
former is the meaning of إِدَامَةُ السَّهْمِ; for, as is<br>\
said in the TK, ادام السَّهْمَ signifies نقره على الابهام<br>\
(i. e. نقّرهُ)]. (T, K.)<br>\

↓ تدوّم, (K, [or this may perhaps be used only<br>\
without an objective complement expressed,]) and<br>\
رَقَبَ, (T,) or تَرَقَّبَ: (Sh, TA:) you say, اِسْتَدِمْ<br>\

expect, await, wait for, or watch for, such a<br>\
thing.] (T.) [When no objective complement is<br>\
expressed, it seems to mean (assumed tropical:)  He paused, and<br>\
acted with deliberation, or in a patient or leisurely<br>\
manner, or he waited in expectation; app. from<br>\
the same verb as syn. with دَوَّمَ; and thus, like one<br>\
who hovers about a thing: see حَوَّمَ; and see also<br>\
اِنْتَظَرَ.] And استدامهُ (tropical:)  He acted with moderation,<br>\
gently, deliberately, or leisurely, in it; (S, M, K,<br>\
TA;) namely, an affair, or a case: (S:) or he<br>\
sought, desired, asked, or demanded, its continuance, or long continuance, or endless continuance:<br>\
and so ↓ داومهُ (M, K, TA) in both of these<br>\
senses: (K, TA:) or he asked him to render a<br>\
thing continual &amp;c.: (Mgh, Msb, TA:) and also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  he acted gently and deliberately in it; namely,<br>\
an affair, or a case: (Msb:) and (assumed tropical:)  he acted gently<br>\
with him; (Fr, T in art. ديم, M, Msb, Kt;) i. e.,<br>\
another person, (Msb,) or his creditor; as also<br>\
اِسْتَدْمَاهُ, (Fr, T, M, K,) which we judge to be<br>\
formed from the former by transposition, because<br>\
we do not find it [in this sense] to have any inf. n.<br>\
(M.) A poet says, (T, S, Msb,) namely, Keys<br>\
Ibn-Zuheyr, (S,)<br>\
فَلَا تَعْجَلْ بِأَمْرِكَ وَاسْتَدِمْهُ<br>\
↓ فَمَا صَلَّى عَصَاكَ كَمُسْتَدِيمِ<br>\
(T, S, Msb,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [Therefore haste not in thine<br>\
affair, but act with moderation, gently, deliberately, or leisurely, therein]; for no one has<br>\
straightened thy staff by turning it round over the<br>\
fire, (T,) meaning, no one has managed thine affair<br>\
soundly, like one who acts with moderation, &amp;c.<br>\
(T, Msb.) And another says, (S,) namely,<br>\
Mejnoon, (TA,)<br>\
وَإِنَّى عَلَى لَيْلَى لَزَارٍ وَإِنَّنِى<br>\
عَلَىذَاكَ فِيمَا بَيْنَنَا أَسْتَدِيمُهَا<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [And verily I am blaming Leylà; and<br>\
verily, notwithstanding that,] I look for her<br>\
aiding me by good conduct [in the matter that<br>\
is between us]. (S.) You say also, أَسْتَدِيمُ اللّٰهَ<br>\
نِعْمَتَكَ I seek, or desire, or ask, of God the<br>\
continuance, or long continuance, or endless continuance, of thy favour, or the like. (Mgh, TA. *)<br>\
And أَسْتَدِيمُ اللّٰهَ عِزَّكَ I ask God to continue, or<br>\
continue long, &amp;c., thy might, or power, &amp;c.<br>\
(Msb.) The phrase استدام لُبْسَ الثَّوْبِ, meaning<br>\
[He continued long the wearing of the garment,<br>\
or] he did not hasten to pull off the garment,<br>\
may be from the saying اِسْتَدَمْتُ عَاقِبَةَ الأَمْرِ,<br>\

night; and the most thereof, of any period: (AZ,<br>\
S in art. ديم:) or rain that continues some days:<br>\
(Msb:) or rain that continues long and is still,<br>\
without thunder and lightning: (K, * TA:) or<br>\
rain that continues five days, or six, (M, K,) or<br>\
seven, (K,) or a day and a night, (T in art. ديم,<br>\
M, K,) or more; (T, TA;) or the least whereof<br>\
is a third of a day or of a night; and the most<br>\
thereof, of any period: (K, TA:) pl. دِيَمٌ, (S, M,<br>\
K,) the و being changed [into ى] in the pl.<br>\
because it is changed in the sing., (M,) and دُيُومٌ,<br>\
(Abu-l-&#39;Omeythil, T, K,) and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ دِيْمٌ<br>\
(Sh, T, TA.) [See also مُدَامٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence other<br>\
things are thus termed by way of comparison.<br>\
(S.) It is said in a trad. (S, M) of &#39;Áïsheh, (M,)<br>\
كَانَ عَمَلُهُ دِيمَةً (S, M, Msb) (assumed tropical:)  His work was<br>\
incessant [but moderate, or not excessive]; (Msb;)<br>\
referring to Mohammad; (T, S, M, Msb;) on her<br>\
being asked if he preferred some days to others:<br>\
(T:) she likened it to the rain termed ديمة in<br>\
respect of continuance and moderation. (T, M.)<br>\
And it is related of Hudheyfeh that he said,<br>\
mentioning فِتَن [i. e. trials, or probations, or<br>\
conflicts and factions, &amp;c.], إِنَّهَا لَآتِيَتُكُمْ دِيمًا دِيمًا,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Verily they are coming to you]<br>\
filling the earth, or land, [and] with continuance. (T.)<br>\
دَامَآءُ (in the CK [erroneously] دَأْماءُ) The sea,<br>\
or a great river; syn. بَحْرٌ; (M, K;) because of<br>\
the continuance of its water: (M:) originally<br>\
دَوَمَآءُ, or دَوْمَآءُ: if the latter, the change of the و<br>\
into ا is anomalous. (TA.)<br>\
الدَّوَمَآءُ: see 1, near the end of the paragraph.<br>\
دَيْمُومٌ and دَيْمُومَةٌ, held by Aboo-&#39;Alee to be<br>\
from الدَّوَامُ, and therefore to belong to the present<br>\
art.: (TA:) see art. دم.<br>\
-A2-  The latter is also an<br>\
inf. n. of دَامَ [q. v.]. (S, M, Msb, K.)<br>\
دُوَامٌ (tropical:)  A vertigo, or giddiness in the head; i. q.<br>\
دُوَارٌ (S, * M, * K, TA. [In the CK, دَواءٌ is erroneously put for دُوَارٌ.]) You say, أَخَذَهُ دُوَامٌ (tropical:)  [A<br>\
vertigo took him, or attacked him]. (S.) And<br>\
بِهِ دُوَامٌ (tropical:)  [He has a vertigo]. (As, TA.)<br>\
دُوَّامٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
دُوَّامَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  The فَلْكَة [or round thing, i. e. top,]<br>\
which the boy throws, and makes to revolve, or<br>\
spin, upon the ground, by means of a string:<br>\
(S, M, * K: *) the derivation of the word has been<br>\
explained above: see 2, in two places: (T, S:)<br>\
pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] ↓ دُوَّامٌ. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
دُوَّامَةُ البَحْرِ (assumed tropical:)  [The whirlpool of the sea; so in<br>\
the present day;] the middle of the sea, upon<br>\
which the waves circle (تدوم [i. e. تُدَوِّم]). (TA.)<br>\
دَائِمٌ [Continuing, lasting, enduring, or remaining: being extended or prolonged: (see 1, first<br>\
sentence:)] continuing, lasting, enduring, or remaining, long: (TA:) [and continuing, lasting,<br>\
or existing, incessantly, always, endlessly, or for<br>\
ever; permanent, perpetual, or everlasting: (see,<br>\
again, 1, first sentence:)] and ↓ دَوْمٌ signifies the<br>\
same as دَائِمٌ, (S, M, K,) applied to shade; (S,<br>\
M;) being an inf. n. used as an epithet: (M:)<br>\
and ↓ دَيُّومٌ, also, (M, K,) [of the measure فَيْعُولٌ,<br>\
originally دَيْوُوِمٌ,] like قَيُّومٌ, (M,) signifies the<br>\
same as دائمٌ [app. in the last of the senses explained above; being of a form proper to intensive<br>\
epithets]: (M, K:) Lakeet Ibn-Zurárah says,<br>\
شَتَّانَ هٰذَا وَالعِنَاقُ وَالنَّوْمٌ<br>\
وَالمَشْرَبُ البَارِدُ وَالظِّلُّ الدَّوْمْ<br>\
[Different, or widely different, are this and<br>\
embracing and sleeping and the cool drinkingplace and the continual shade]. (IB, TA.) And<br>\
the Jews are related, in a trad. of &#39;Áïsheh, to have<br>\
said [to the Muslims], ↓ عَلَيْكُمْ السَّامُ الدَّامُ, meaning المَوْتُ الدَّائِمُ, [i. e. May everlasting death<br>\
come upon you; saying السَّامُ in the place of<br>\
السَّلَامُ, and] suppressing the ى [or rather the<br>\
hemzeh] because of [their desire to assimilate الدائم<br>\
to] السام. (TA.) [Hence دَائِمًا meaning Continually: and always, or for ever.] — Also (tropical:)  Still,<br>\
or motionless; said, in this sense, of water; (S,<br>\
M, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) and so ↓ دَوْمٌ. (M, TA.)<br>\
— It is also said of that which is in motion, [as<br>\
signifying (assumed tropical:)  Going round, revolving, or circling,<br>\
(see 1,)] as well as of that which is still, or<br>\
motionless; thus having two contr. meanings:<br>\
so says Aboo-Bekr. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ↓ مَرَقَةٌ<br>\
دَاوِمَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Broth into which is put much grease so<br>\
that this swims round upon it]: which is extr.,<br>\
because the و in this instance should by rule be<br>\
changed into a hemzeh. (M. [The meaning is<br>\
there indicated by the mention of this phrase<br>\
immediately after دَوَّمَ المَرَقَةَ, q. v.])<br>\
مَرَقَةٌ دَاوِمَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
دَيُّومٌ:see دَائِمٌ, first sentence.<br>\
أَدْوَمُ [More, and most, continual, lasting, &amp;c.]<br>\
You say, هُوَ أَدْوَمُ مِنْ كَذَا [It is more continual,<br>\
or lasting, &amp;c., than such a thing]: from الدَّوَامُ.<br>\
(IJ, M.)<br>\
مُدَامٌ Continual, or lasting, rain. (IJ, M, K.)<br>\
[See also دِيمَةٌ, above.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And Wine; as also<br>\
↓ مُدَامَةٌ: (T, S, M, K:) so called because it is<br>\
made to continue for a time (T, M) in the دَنّ,<br>\
(T,) or in its receptacle, (M,) until it becomes<br>\
still after fermenting: (T:) or because, by reason<br>\
of its abundance, it does not become exhausted:<br>\
(Sh, T:) or because of its oldness: (AO, T:) or<br>\
because it is the only beverage of which the<br>\
drinking can be long continued: (M, K:) or<br>\
because the drinking thereof is continued for days,<br>\
to the exclusion of other beverages. (A, TA.)<br>\
مُدَامَةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
مِدْوَمٌ and ↓ مِدْوَامٌ A stick, or piece of wood,<br>\
(M, K,) or some other thing, (M,) with which one<br>\
stills the boiling of the cooking-pot. (Lh, M, K.)<br>\
أَرْضٌ مَدِيمَةٌ, (Yz, S, M, K, TA, [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, مُدِيمَةٌ,]) and ↓ مُدَيَّمَةٌ, (M, TA,)<br>\
Land upon which have fallen rains such as are<br>\
termed دِيِمٌ [pl. of دِيمَةٌ]. (Yz, * S, * M, K, * TA.)<br>\
مُدِيمٌ i. q. رَاعِفٌ (S, K) [Having blood flowing<br>\
from his nose: or, accord. to the PS and TK as<br>\
meaning having a continual bleeding of the nose].<br>\
أَرْضٌ مُدَيَّمَةٌ: see مَدِيمَةٌ.<br>\
مِدْوَامٌ: see مِدْوَمٌ.<br>\
مُتَدَوِّمَاتٌ, applied to birds, means Going round,<br>\
or circling, over a thing: and this is meant by<br>\
↓ مُتَدَاوِمَات, which is used for the former word,<br>\
in the saying [of a rájiz], describing horses,<br>\
كَالطَّيْرِ تَبْقِى مُتَدَاوِمَاتِهَا<br>\
i. e. Like birds when thou lookest at, or watchest,<br>\
those of them that are going round, or circling,<br>\
over a thing: (S, TA: *) or متدوّمات signifies<br>\
waiting, or watching. (TA.)<br>\
مُتَدَاومَاتٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
مُسْتَدِيمٌ: see 10. Accord. to Sh, (TA,) it<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  Exceeding the usual bounds in an<br>\
affair; striving, or labouring, therein; or taking<br>\
pains, or extraordinary pains, therein. (T, TA.)<br>\
