دَغَمَ, aor.<br>\
دَغَمَ, (K,) inf. n. دَغْمٌ, (JK, S,) He,<br>\
or it, broke the nose, making the breach to extend into the interior. (JK, S, K. [So too accord.<br>\
to the explanation of the inf. n. in the KL;<br>\
though Golius renders it, and app. دَغَّمَ also, as<br>\
on the authority of the KL, “depressit nasum; ”<br>\
while Freytag follows him in thus rendering only<br>\
the latter verb; which I do not find in any<br>\
Lexicon.])<br>\
-A2-  Also, (M, K,) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(M, TA,) He covered a vessel. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And,<br>\
said of rain, It covered, or overwhelmed, and<br>\
prevailed over, or subdued, the earth, or land; as<br>\
also ↓ ادغم. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And دَغَمَهُمْ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
دَغَمَ;<br>\
(K;) and دَغِمَهُمْ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
دَغَمَ; (K;) inf. n.<br>\
دَغْمٌ and دَغَمانٌ; (TA;) said of heat, (S, K,)<br>\
and of cold also, (JK, K,) It came upon them,<br>\
[properly] as though it were a thing that covered<br>\
them; syn. غَشِيَهُمْ; as also ↓ أَدْغَمَهُمْ. (S, K. [Golius,<br>\
app. misled by a wrong interpretation which I<br>\
find in the KL, (mentioned by him as one of his<br>\
authorities in this case, in addition to the S and<br>\
K,) explains these three verbs as meaning “ totum<br>\
corripuit, et deliquio animi affecit: ” and Freytag<br>\
has followed him herein.])<br>\
-A3-  [The inf. n.] دَغْمًا<br>\
is also used, (K, TA,) in a form of imprecation,<br>\
(TA,) as an imitative sequent to رَغْمًا [q. v.], and<br>\
is in like manner followed by سِنَّغْمًا, (K, TA,)<br>\
or شِنَّغْمًا. (TA.) And one says, فَعَلْتُ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى<br>\
رَغْمِهِ وَدَغْمِهِ وَشِنَّغْمِهِ [meaning I did that in spite<br>\
of him; or against his will]. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَدْغَمَ see above, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  ادغم الفَرَسَ<br>\
اللِّجَامَ He put the bit into the mouth of the<br>\
horse; (JK, Az, S, K;) as also ادغم اللِّجَامَ فِى<br>\
فَمِ الفَرَسِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (Az, S, TA,)<br>\
though some say that the reverse is the case,<br>\
(TA,) ادغم الحَرْفَ (Az, S, K) فِى الحَرْفِ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. إِدْغَامٌ, (JK, S,) He inserted [or incorporated] the letter into the letter; (JK, K, TA;)<br>\
as also ↓اِدَّغَمَهُ, (S, K,) [which is itself an<br>\
example of the incorporation of one letter<br>\
into another, being] originally اِدْتَغَمَهُ. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  ادغمهُ, said of God, He blackened his face:<br>\
(K:) and i. q. أَرْغَمَهُ; (K, * TA;) both signify<br>\
(tropical:)  He did evil to him, and angered him: or the<br>\
former verb has the former of these significations,<br>\
explained in the K; and the latter verb signifies,<br>\
with its pronoun, “he angered him. ” (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
ادغمهُ إِلَى كَذَا He, or it, caused him to want<br>\
such a thing; (AA, TA in art. دمغ;) [and] so<br>\
ادغمهُ لِكَذَا; (L in art. جلد;) as also ادمغهُ.<br>\
(AA, L in art. جلد voce أَجْلَدَ, and TA in art.<br>\
دمغ.)<br>\
-A4-  ادغم فُلَانٌ Such a one vied, or strove,<br>\
with the people, or party, in hastening [to eat],<br>\
fearing lest they should be before him, and therefore ate the food without chewing. (K, * TA.)<br>\
[And أَدْمَغَ طَعَامَهُ, as explained in the TA in art.<br>\
دمغ, has a similar meaning.]<br>\

إِدْتَغَمَ see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
11<br>\
ادغامّ, inf. n. اِدْغِيمَامٌ, said of a horse, He<br>\
was of a colour inclining to blackness in his face<br>\
and lips, [or in his face and the part next the<br>\
lips,] blacker therein than in the other parts of<br>\
his body. (K.)<br>\
دَغَمٌ and ↓ دُغْمَةٌ, in a horse, [and in some other<br>\
animals, (see أَدْغَمُ,)] A colour inclining to blackness, (S, K,) in the face and the part next the<br>\
lips, (S,) or in the face and the lips, (K,) differing from, (S,) or blacker than, (K,) the colour of<br>\
the other parts of the body. (S, K.)<br>\
دُغْمَةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
دُغْمَانٌ, with damm, (S, K,) applied to a man,<br>\
(S,) Black: (S, K:) or black and big. (K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also a pl. of أَدْغَمُ [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
دُغَامٌ A pain in the fauces. (K.)<br>\
دَاغِمٌ an imitative sequent to رَاغِمٌ. (K, * TA.)<br>\
أَدْغَمُ A horse of a colour inclining to blackness,<br>\
(S, K,) or of a black colour, (Mgh,) in the face<br>\
and the part next the lips, (S,) or in the face and<br>\
the lips, (K,) or in the face and the muzzle,<br>\
(Mgh,) differing from, (S, Mgh,) or blacker<br>\
than, (K,) the colour of the other parts of the<br>\
body; (S, Mgh, K;) called in Pers. دَيْزَج [or<br>\
rather دِيزَهْ, from which دَيْزَجٌ is arabicized];<br>\
(AO, * S, Mgh, K;) in some instances, without<br>\
any admixture of خُضْرَة [here meaning dark, or<br>\
ashy, dust-colour]: (AO, TA:) it is also applied<br>\
as an epithet to a wolf: and the fem. is دَغْمَآءُ:<br>\
and the pl. is دُغْمٌ: (S:) the masc. is also applied<br>\
to a ram, meaning having any, the least, blackness; especially in the end of the nose and beneath<br>\
the chin: and the fem. to a ewe, meaning black<br>\
in the end of the nose and in the chin; (TA;) or,<br>\
thus applied, black in the face: (JK:) and the<br>\
masc. also signifies black in the nose: (JK, K:)<br>\
in which sense it has for its pl. دُغْمَانٌ: (TA:)<br>\
accord. to the K [and the JK], دُغْمٌ, a pl. of أَدْغَمُ,<br>\
signifies white; as though it had two contr.<br>\
meanings; but this is a mistranscription for دُعْمٌ,<br>\
with the unpointed ع. (TA.) It is said in a<br>\
prov., الذّئْبُ أَدْغَمُ [The wolf is blackish in the<br>\
face and in the part next the lips, not being so<br>\
in the other parts; or rather, is black in the<br>\
nose]: for, whether he lap from a vessel or not,<br>\
دُغْمَة is a necessary characteristic of the wolf,<br>\
[all] wolves being دُغْم; and therefore he is sometimes, or often, suspected of having lapped from<br>\
a vessel when he is [really] hungry: the prov. is<br>\
applied to him who is regarded with a wish for<br>\
the like of that which he has not obtained. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also One who snuffles; i. e., speaks from<br>\
[i. e. through] his nose; (JK, K, TA;) i. e. i. q.<br>\
أَخَنُّ. (TA.)<br>\
