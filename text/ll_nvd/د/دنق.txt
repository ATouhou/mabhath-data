دَنَقَ, aor.<br>\
دَنُقَ and<br>\
دَنِقَ, inf. n. دُنُوقٌ, He pursued<br>\
small, little, or minute, things. (JK, Ibn-&#39;Abbád,<br>\
Z, K. [See also 2.]) [Two other significations<br>\
assigned to دَنَقَ in the CK and in the Lexicons of<br>\
Golius and Freytag belong to دَنَّقَ.]<br>\
2<br>\
دنّق, (S, Mgh, TA,) inf. n. تَدْنِيقٌ, (Mgh,<br>\
K,) He went to the utmost point [in his dealings<br>\
&amp;c.]: (S, K, TA:) he was minute, observant of<br>\
small things, nice, or scrupulous: (Mgh:) he<br>\
examined minutely into his dealings and expenses.<br>\
(So accord. to an explanation of the act. part. n.<br>\
in the TA.) Hence the saying, لَا تُدَنَّقُوا فَيُدَنَّقَ<br>\
عَلَيْكُمْ [Go not ye to the utmost point against<br>\
others, for in that case the utmost point may be<br>\
gone to against you]. (S, TA.) And the saying<br>\
of El-Hasan, (Mgh, TA,) لَعَنَ اللّٰهُ الدَّانَقَ وَ مَنْ<br>\
دَنَّقَ, (TA,) or وَ مَنْ دَنَّقَ بِهِ, (Mgh,) [May God<br>\
curse the دانق and him who has been minute, &amp;c.,<br>\
in his dealings, or and him who has been minute,<br>\
&amp;c., therewith;] as though he meant to forbid the<br>\
considering and examining a paltry or contemptible thing: (TA:) or, as some relate it, وَ أَوَّلَ مَنْ<br>\
أَحْدَثَ الدَّانَقَ [and the first who innovated the<br>\
دانَق], meaning El-Hajjáj. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
تَدْنِيقٌ, metonymically, signifies (tropical:)  The being niggardly, stingy, or avaricious. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
The continuing to look at a thing; (S, K;) as<br>\
also تَرْنِيقٌ: [or rather each has this signification<br>\
elliptically; for] you say, دنّق إِلَيْهِ النَّظَرَ and رنّق<br>\
[meaning He continued looking at it]. (S.)<br>\
[See رَنَّقَ.] And in like manner, The looking<br>\
weakly. (S, TA.) And دنّق بَصَرَهُ He looked<br>\
hard, and sharply, or intently. (JK.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also<br>\
(tropical:)  The approaching of the sun to setting. (S, K,<br>\
TA.) You say, دنّقت الشَّمْسُ (tropical:)  The sun became<br>\
near to setting. (JK, TA. [See also رنّقت.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And دنّق (tropical:)  He (a man) died: (JK, TA:) or<br>\
(tropical:)  he was near to dying; inf. n. as above. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And دنّقت عَيْنُهُ, (JK, K, TA, [accord. to the<br>\
CK دَنَقَتْ, which is wrong,]) inf. n. تَدْنِيقٌ, (S,<br>\
TA,) (tropical:)  His eye sank, or became depressed, in his<br>\
head: (JK, S, K, TA:) or, accord. to Az, the<br>\
more correct explanation is, the ball, or globe,<br>\
of his eye became prominent, and apparent.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And دنّق وَجْهُهُ, (Lth, K, TA, [in the<br>\
CK, erroneously, دَنَقَ,]) inf. n. تَدْنِيقٌ, (Lth, TA,)<br>\
His face exhibited emaciation, arising from<br>\
fatigue or disease. (Lth, K, TA.)<br>\
دُنُوقٌ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned]<br>\
Persons niggardly, or parsimonious, in expenditure, towards their households (IAar, K, TA)<br>\
and themselves. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
دَنِيقٌ One who alights by himself, (TA,) and<br>\
eats by himself in the daytime, and in the moonlight by night, last the guest should see him: (K,<br>\
TA:) mentioned by IAar, on the authority of Abu-I-Mekárim: and so كِيصٌ and صُوصٌ. (TA.)<br>\
دَانَقٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
دَانِقٌ Foolish; stupid; having little, or no,<br>\
intellect, or understanding: (K:) and so دَائِقٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  A thief. (JK, Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Emaciated and falling down, or emaciated<br>\
and tottering; expl. by مَهْزُولٌ سَاقِطٌ: (AA, S, K:)<br>\
or falling down, or tottering, (سَاقِطٌ,) by reason of<br>\
emaciation: (JK:) applied to a man (AA, K)<br>\
and to a she-camel. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Having a constant,<br>\
or chronic, disease, and oppressed thereby so as to<br>\
be at the point of death. (AA, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also,<br>\
and ↓ دَانَقَ, (JK, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) the former,<br>\
accord. to some, the more chaste, arabicized [from<br>\
the Pers. دَانْك or دَانَك], (Msb,) and ↓ دَانَاقٌ,<br>\
(JK, S, K,) like as they said دِرْهَمٌ and دِرْهَامٌ, (S,)<br>\
[but دَانَاقٌ seems to have been disallowed by Sb,<br>\
either as unused or as post-classical,] The sixth<br>\
part of a dirhem (or drachm); (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
[i. e.] two carats; (Mgh;) [i. e.] two grains of<br>\
the خُرْنُوب [or carob], with the ancient Greeks,<br>\
for the dirhem with them was twelve grains of<br>\
the خرنوب; but the دانق of the Muslims is two<br>\
grains of the خرنوب and two thirds of a grain of<br>\
the خرنوب, for the dirhem of the Muslims is<br>\
sixteen grains of the خرنوب: (Msb:) and the<br>\
sixth part of the deenár: (TA: [but this I find<br>\
nowhere else: see دِينَارٌ: and see also رِطْلٌ:]) the<br>\
pl. of دانق is دَوَانِقُ and دَوَانِيقُ; (Mgh, TA;) the<br>\
former is said by Az to be pl. of دَانِقٌ; and the<br>\
latter, of دَانَقٌ; and it is said that every pl. of the<br>\
measure فَوَاعِلُ or مَفَاعِلُ may be lengthened with<br>\
ى so that one may say فَوَاعِيلُ and مَفَاعِيلُ:<br>\
(Msb:) or, accord. to Sb, دَوَانِيقُ is pl. of ↓ دَانَاقٌ,<br>\
though this be not in their speech. (TA.) [Also<br>\
A small silver coin, the sixth part of the coin<br>\
called دِرْهَم.] The dim. is ↓ دُوَيْنِيقٌ. (TA.)<br>\
دَانَاقٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
دَوَانِقِىٌّ [rel. n. from دَوَانِقُ pl. of دَانِقٌ], (ElMekeen, “Hist. Sarac. ” p. 104,) or دَوَانِيقِىٌّ<br>\
[rel. n. from دَوَانِيقُ pl. of دَانَاقٌ], (TA,) [Of, or<br>\
belonging or relating to, dániks: and hence,] a<br>\
surname of the &#39;Abbásee Khaleefeh Aboo-Jaáfar<br>\
El-Mansoor; (El-Mekeen, TA;) because of his<br>\
extreme niggardliness. (El-Mekeen.)<br>\
دُوَينِيْقٌ: see دَانِقٌ, last sentence.<br>\
مُدَنِّقٌ One who examines minutely into his<br>\
dealings and expenses: used in this sense by the<br>\
people of El-&#39;Irák. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَيْنٌ مُدَنِّقَةٌ An eye<br>\
of which the ball, or globe, is prominent, and<br>\
apparent: so accord. to AZ; and Az holds this<br>\
to be the correct explanation, rather than an eye<br>\
sunk, or depressed, in the head. (TA.)<br>\
