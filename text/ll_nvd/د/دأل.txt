دَاَ^َ, inf. n. دَأْلٌ (S, M, K) and دَأَلٌ<br>\
(K [perhaps a mistake for the next, which is<br>\
well known but not mentioned in the K, but see<br>\
ذَأَلَ,]) and دَأَلَانٌ (S, M) and دَأَلَى, (M, K,) He<br>\
walked, or went, in a weak manner, (M, K,) and<br>\
with haste: (M:) or he ran with short steps:<br>\
(M, K:) or he walked, or went, in a brisk, or<br>\
sprightly, manner: (K:) or he walked, or went,<br>\
as though labouring in his gait, by reason of<br>\
briskness, or sprightliness: (M:) [or he went<br>\
along by little and little, stealthily, lest he should<br>\
make a sound to be heard: for] دَأْلٌ is syn. with<br>\
خَتْلٌ: or, accord. to AZ, it signifies the walking,<br>\
or going, in a manner resembling that which is<br>\
termed خَتْلٌ; and in the manner of him who is<br>\
heavily burdened, or overburdened: and As, in<br>\
describing the manner in which horses go, explains دَأَلَانٌ as signifying the walking, or going,<br>\
with short steps, and in an unusual manner, as<br>\
though heavily burdened, or overburdened. (S.)<br>\

-b2-  [Hence, app.,] دَأَلَ لَهُ, aor. as<br>\
above, inf. n. دَأْلٌ and دَأَلَانٌ, He deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or outwitted, him;<br>\
syn. خَتَلَهُ: (M, K:) [and ↓ دَاأَلَهُ signifies the<br>\
same: or he practised with him mutual deceit,<br>\
delusion, &amp;c.: for] مُدَاأَلَةٌ is syn. with مُخَاتَلَةٌ;<br>\
and sometimes it is with a quick pace: (AA,<br>\
T, K:) you say, دَأَلْتُ لَهُ and دَاأَلْتُهُ: (AA, T,<br>\
TA:) and الذِّئْبُ بَدْأَلُ لِلْغَزَالِ لِيَأْكُلَهُ i. e. يَخْتُلُهُ<br>\
[The wolf deceives, &amp;c., the gazelle, or young<br>\
gazelle, that he may eat him]. (AZ, T, TA.)<br>\

دُئِلٌ, and sometimes it is pronounced ↓ دُؤُلٌ,<br>\
The jackal; as also ↓ دَأَلَانٌ and ↓ دَأْلٌ: and the<br>\
wolf: and a certain small animal resembling<br>\
what is called اِبْنُ عِرْسٍ [the weasel]: (K accord.<br>\
to the TA: [accord. to the CK, and app. most<br>\
MS. copies of the K, ↓ دَأْلٌ has the last two significations, and not the first signification: but<br>\
this is inconsistent with what follows the last signification in the K, as it would require us to read<br>\
that الدَّأْلُ, instead of الدُّئِلُ, which is well known<br>\
as the correct form, is the name of the father of a<br>\
certain tribe:]) دُئِلٌ has the last of these significations: (T, S:) or it signifies a certain small<br>\
animal resembling the fox; and this is well<br>\
known: and accord. to Kr. ↓ دُؤُلٌ signifies a certain small animal; but this is not known: and<br>\
accord. to him also, ↓ دَأَلَانٌ, with fet-h to the ء,<br>\
signifies the wolf; (M;) as also ذَأَلَانٌ; (TA;)<br>\
or so ↓ دَأْلَانٌ and ذَأْلَانٌ; and also the jackal.<br>\
(Lth in art. ذأل.) دُئِلٌ is the only instance of the<br>\
measure فُعِلٌ (S, K) known to Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà, (S,) i. e. Th: (TA:) but there are several<br>\
other instances: (MF, TA:) [one of these is رُئِمٌ,<br>\
or الرُّئِمُ.]<br>\
دَأْلَانٌ and دَأَلَانٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in three places.<br>\
دُؤْلُولٌ A calamity, or misfortune: (S, M, O,<br>\
K:) pl. دَآلِيلُ. (S.) And Confusion. (K.) You<br>\
say, وَقَعَ القَوْمُ فِى دُؤْلُولٍ The people, or party,<br>\
fell into confusion in respect of their case or<br>\
affairs. (S.)<br>\
دَؤُولٌ [That runs in the manner termed دَأَلَانٌ,<br>\
inf. n. of 1,] is [an epithet] from الدالان [i. e.<br>\
الدَّأَلَانُ], which signifies a kind of running, as<br>\
also ↓ دَأالين and ↓ دااليل [i. e. دَآلِينُ and دَآليلُ,<br>\
pls. of دَأَلَانٌ; the latter irreg., like ذَآلِيلُ pl. of<br>\
دَأَلَانٌ, q. v.]. (Ham p. 458.) [See also ذَؤُولٌ.]<br>\
