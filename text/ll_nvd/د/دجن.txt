دَجُنَ, inf. n. دَجْنٌ and دُجُونٌ, It (a<br>\
day) was, or became, one in which the clouds<br>\

signifies the same, accord. to IAar. (TA. [See<br>\
also 4.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  دَجَنَتِ السَّحَابُ i. q. ↓ ادجنت [meaning The clouds rained continually]: (TA:) [for]<br>\
السَّمَآءُ ↓ ادجنت signifies the sky rained continually: (S, K:) [or دَجَنَتِ السَّحَابُ and ↓ ادجنت<br>\
may mean the clouds covered the sky, or the<br>\
regions of the sky, or the earth: for] ↓ الدَّجْنُ [is<br>\
app. the inf. n. of the former verb, and] signifies<br>\
the clouds&#39; covering (S, M, K) the sky, (S,) or<br>\
the regions of the sky, (M, K,) or the earth.<br>\

place; (S, Msb, K, TA;) kept to it, or became<br>\
accustomed to it: (TA:) and so ↓ ادجن. (S,<br>\

-b4-  And hence, (TA,) دَجَنَ said of the<br>\
pigeon, and the sheep or goat, &amp;c., (K, TA,) as,<br>\
for instance, the camel, (TA,) (tropical:)  It kept to the<br>\
house or tent. (K, TA.) ―<br>\

in the M, that it signifies the mixing in familiar,<br>\
or social, intercourse, or conversing, in a good<br>\
manner. (TA.) [Golius assigns to داجن another signification of داهن; namely “ He held in<br>\
contempt;” as on the authority of the KL; in<br>\
my copy of which it is not mentioned; nor can I<br>\
find it elsewhere.]<br>\

أَدْجَنَ see 1, in six places. ―<br>\
-b2-  ادجن also signifies<br>\
It (a day) became one of much rain; and so<br>\
↓ اِدْجَوْجَنَ: (K:) or the latter has a more intensive meaning, i. e. it became cloudy with mist<br>\
or vapour, and dark [with rain]; and [simply]<br>\
it became dark, or obscure. (TA. [See also 1,<br>\
first sentence.]) ―<br>\

اِدْجَوْجَنَ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
دَجْنٌ: see 1, second sentence: and see also<br>\
دُجُنَّةٌ [which has the same, or a similar, signification]. Accord. to Az, it signifies The shade of<br>\
the clouds in a day of rain. (TA.) ―<br>\

meaning, accord. to the K, A day of much, or<br>\
abundant, rain; but it seems to be indicated in<br>\
the S that the meaning is a day of clouds covering<br>\
the whole sky, full of moisture, and dark, but<br>\
containing no rain]: and in like manner one says<br>\
of the night [app. لَيلَةُ دَجْنٍ and لَيْلَةٌ دَجْنٌ as<br>\
well as ↓ لَيْلَةٌ دُجُنَّةٍ and لَيْلَةٌ دُجُنَّةٌ]: using the<br>\
latter word both as the complement of a prefixed<br>\
noun and as an epithet. (AZ, S, K.)<br>\
دُجْنٌ: see دُجُنَّةٌ.<br>\
دُجْنَةٌ [or ↓ دُجُنَّةٌ ?] Rain: so in the phrase<br>\
يَوْمٌ ذُو دُجْنَةٍ [or دُجُنَّةٍ ?] a day of rain; as also<br>\
ذُو دُغْنَةٍ [or دُغُنَّةٍ]. (TA.) ―<br>\

دُجُنٌّ: see the next paragraph, in three places.<br>\
دُجُنَّةٌ (AZ, S, K) and ↓ دِجِنَّةٌ and ↓ دُجُنٌّ (K)<br>\
Clouds covering the whole sky, full of moisture,<br>\
and dark, but containing no rain; (AZ, S, K;)<br>\
pl. ↓ دُجُنٌّ [or this is a coll. gen. n. of which دُجُنَّةٌ<br>\
is the n. un., though said to be syn. with this last,<br>\
as well as a pl.]: (K:) and darkness; syn.<br>\
ظُلْمَةٌ: or the first of these words (دُجُنَّةٌ) has this<br>\
last signification; i. e. ظُلْمَةٌ, or ظَلْمَآءُ; [thus in<br>\
some copies of the K and in the TA; but in<br>\
other copies of the K ظَلْمَآءُ only;] and is also<br>\
without teshdeed; (K;) i. e., it is also written<br>\
↓ دُجْنَةٌ, as in the “ Book ” of Sb: this is explained by Seer [and in the S] as syn. with ظُلْمَةٌ;<br>\
and, accord. to Sb, its pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]<br>\
is ↓ دُجْنٌ; but in the S it is said that its pl. is<br>\
دُجَنٌ, i. e. like صُرَدٌ, and دُجُنَاتٌ and دُجَنَاتٌ:<br>\
(TA: [but in one copy of the S, I find دُجْنٌ<br>\
and دُجْنَاتٌ; and in another, دُجَنٌ and دُجُنَاتٌ:])<br>\
and ↓ دُجُنٌّ is syn. with ↓ دَجْنٌ [q. v.]: (K, TA:<br>\
[in the CK, الدُّجُنُ is erroneously put for الدُّجُنُّ;<br>\
and الدَّجْنُ, which should immediately follow it,<br>\
is omitted:]) the pl. of دُجُنَّةٌ is دُجُنَّاتٌ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\

earth, and being heaped; one upon another, and<br>\

and still, &amp;c.]. (AZ, S, K. [Freytag has written the word, as on the authority of the K,<br>\

upon him for the irrigation of land; syn. سَانٍ<br>\
[q. v.]: (K:) or that is accustomed to the irrigation of land, or to be used for drawing water<br>\
upon him for that purpose: (TA:) and ↓ مَدْجُونَةٌ<br>\
applied to a she-camel has this latter signification.<br>\
(K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And دَاجِنٌ (S, Mgh, K) and رَاجِنٌ,<br>\
and some of the Arabs say دَاجِنَةٌ, (ISk, S,) applied to a sheep or goat (شَاةٌ), (ISk, S, Mgh, K,)<br>\
and a pigeon, (K,) &amp;c., (ISk, S, K,) as, for instance, a camel, (TA,) (tropical:)  That keeps to the houses<br>\
or tents; (ISk, S, Mgh, K, TA;) domesticated,<br>\

occurs in a trad. as meaning a sheep or goat<br>\
home-fed; that is fed by men in their places of<br>\
abode: (TA:) pl. دَوَاجِنُ; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
applied to sheep or goats and pigeons and the<br>\
like that keep to the houses or tents; (Msb; [in<br>\
which it is added that some say دَاجِنَةٌ;]) by ElKarkhee said to be contr. of سَائِمَةٌ; (Mgh;) and<br>\
applied by Lebeed to dogs used for the chase,<br>\
(S,) in this instance meaning trained, or taught:<br>\
(EM p. 164:) or دَاجِنٌ applied to a dog means<br>\
that keeps to the houses or tents; and so ↓ دَجُونٌ.<br>\
(TA)<br>\
