ادقل النَّخْلُ, (inf. n. إِدْقَالٌ, TA,) The palmtrees produced dates such as are termed دَقَل:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) or the dates of the palm-trees<br>\
became دَقَل. (Es-Sarakustee, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ادقلت<br>\
الشَّاةُ The sheep, or goat, was, or became, lean, or<br>\
emaciated, and small in body; despised and little<br>\
in the eyes of beholders. (K.)<br>\

(IAar, TA.)<br>\
دَقَلٌ [A certain kind of palm-trees;] i. q.<br>\
خِصَابٌ [not as meaning “ palm-trees having much<br>\
fruit,” but as an appellation applied by the people<br>\
of El-Bahreyn to the palm-trees which others call<br>\
دَقَلٌ: see art. خصب]: (S, O, TA:) in the K,<br>\
الخِضَابُ is erroneously put for الخِصَابُ: (TA:)<br>\
n. un. with ة: (S:) Az says that دَقَلٌ signifies<br>\
species (أَلْوَانٌ, of which the sing. is لَوْنٌ, [but<br>\
here meaning varieties,]) of palm-trees; and the<br>\
dates thereof are bad, though the دَقَلَة may be<br>\
abundant in fruit; and some have red dates, and<br>\
some have black; the body of the dates being<br>\
small, and the stones being large: (TA:) accord.<br>\
to AHn, the term دَقَلٌ is applied to any palmtrees [of which the varieties are] unknown: the<br>\
n. un. دَقَلَةٌ is syn. with خَصْبَةٌ, of which the pl.<br>\
is خِصَابٌ: and what are termed أَدْقَالٌ [pl. of<br>\
دَقَلٌ] are the worst of palm-trees, and their dates<br>\
are the worst of dates. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also [The<br>\
fruit of the trees thus called; described above;]<br>\
the worst of dates: (JK, S, Msb, K:) or a bad<br>\
kind of dates: (Mgh:) or dates of which the<br>\
kinds are unknown: (M, K:) accord. to EsSarakustee, the fruit of the دَوْم: n. un. with ة.<br>\
(Msb.) A rájiz says,<br>\
لَوْ كُنْتُمُ تَمْرًا لَكُنْتُمُ دَقَلَا<br>\
أَوْ كُنْتُمُ مَآءً لَكُنْتُمُ و شَلَا<br>\
[If ye were dates, ye would be dates of the worst<br>\
kind; and if ye were water, ye would be such as<br>\
distils scantily, in interrupted drops, from a<br>\
mountain or rock]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The mast<br>\
(سَهْم) of a ship; (S, K;) from the same word<br>\
in the first of the senses explained above; (S;)<br>\
in Pers., تِيرِ كِشْتِى, (MA, PS,) and سُتُونْ;<br>\
(MA;) i. e., (or so دَقَلَةٌ [the n. un.], JK,) the<br>\
tall piece of wood of a ship, (JK, T, M, Mgh,)<br>\
fixed in the midst thereof, (JK, T, M,) for the<br>\
sail, (JK,) i. e., upon which the sail is extended,<br>\
(T,) or [rather] to which the sail is suspended;<br>\
(Mgh;) as also ↓ دَوْقَلٌ. (K.)<br>\
دَقَلَةٌ n. un. of دَقَلٌ [which see throughout].<br>\

and ↓ مُدْقِلٌ A sheep, or goat, lean, or emaciated,<br>\
and small in body; despised and little in the<br>\
eyes of beholders: pl., of any but the last, دِقَالٌ:<br>\
(K:) or, as ISd thinks, the pl., of دَقِيلَةٌ is دَقَائِلُ,<br>\
unless it be formed by the rejection of the augmentative letter [in the sing.]. (TA.)<br>\
دَقِلَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
دَقِيلَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
دَوْقَلٌ: see دَقَلٌ, last sentence.<br>\
