the contr. of غَلِيظ; as also ↓ استدقّ: (S, K:)<br>\
[i. e. it was, or became, thin as meaning slender,<br>\
or small in diameter or circumference as compared with length: also small in all dimensions;<br>\
small in size; minute, or fine, either as a whole,<br>\
or in its component particles: and sometimes, as<br>\
said of a garment or the like, thin, or fine, as<br>\
opposed to thick or coarse; like رَقَّ:] contr. of<br>\
غَلُظَ: (Msb:) ↓ استدقّ is said of the هِلَال [or<br>\
moon a little after or before the change], and of<br>\
other things. (TA.) [See also رِقَّةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[hence], aor. and inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  He, or it,<br>\
was, or became, little in estimation, paltry, inconsiderable, mean, vile, or contemptible. (TA.) One<br>\
says to him who refuses to confer a benefit, دَقَّ بِكَ<br>\

hath rendered thee mean, &amp;c.; the verb being<br>\
made trans. by بِ, agreeably with a common<br>\
usage mentioned in p. 141]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also,<br>\
[aor. and] inf. n. as above, said of a thing, an<br>\
affair, or a case, [and of speech, or language,] (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
was, or became, subtile, nice, abstruse, recondite,<br>\

(tropical:)  [He was, or became, subtile, nice, abstruse, &amp;c.,<br>\

دَقُ3َ, inf. n. دَقٌّ, (M, Msb,) He<br>\
broke it, (M, K, TA,) or crushed it, (M,) in<br>\
any manner: (M, TA:) or he bruised, brayed,<br>\
or pounded, it; i. e., he beat it with a thing so<br>\
that he broke it, or crushed it: (M, K: *) namely,<br>\
a thing, (S, M, TA,) such as medicine, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence, He beat it; namely, a garment<br>\

دَقَّ البَابَ He knocked at the door for admission.]<br>\

-b3-  And [hence also, (in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
“ or,”) as appears from what follows,] (assumed tropical:)  He made<br>\
it apparent; showed, exhibited, manifested, or<br>\
revealed, it: (K:) so says IAar, citing the<br>\
following verse of Zuheyr:<br>\
تَدَارَكْتُمَا عَبْسًا وَذُبْيَانَ بَعْدَمَا<br>\
تَفَانَوْا وَدَقُّوا بَيْنَهُمْ عِطْرَ مَنْشِمِ<br>\
(TA:) i. e. Ye two repaired the condition of the<br>\
tribes of &#39;Abs and Dhubyán by peace, (تَلَافَيْتُمَا<br>\
أَمْرَهُمَا بِالصُّلْحِ,) after they had shared, one with<br>\
another, in destruction, and had brayed [among<br>\
themselves] the perfume of Menshim as a sign<br>\
of their having leagued together against their<br>\
enemy; i. e., after slaughter had come upon the<br>\
last of their men, as upon the last of those who<br>\
perfumed themselves with the perfume of Menshim: for [it is said that] منشم is the name of<br>\
a woman who sold perfume in Mekkeh, and<br>\
a party bought of her some perfume, and leagued<br>\
together to fight their enemy, making the dipping of their hands in that perfume to be a sign<br>\
of their league; and they fought until they were<br>\
slain to the last of them: whence the prov.,<br>\
أَشْأَمُ مِنْ عِطْرِ مَنْشِمَ: (EM p. 117:) [so that,<br>\
accord. to this explanation, which is one of many,<br>\
منشم is made perfectly decl. for the sake of the<br>\
rhyme:] or the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  after they had<br>\
manifested enmities and faults. (TA.) One says<br>\
also, in cases of enmity, لَأَدُقَّنَّ شُعُورَكَ, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I will assuredly manifest thy circumstances.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

brayed, or pounded, finely; he comminuted, or<br>\
pulverized; syn. أَنْعَمَ الدَّقَّ. (S, K.) This is the<br>\
primary signification. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [He made a minute examination. ―<br>\
-b3-  And He<br>\
spoke, or expressed himself, and] he proved a<br>\
question, or a problem, in a subtile, nice, abstruse,<br>\

scrupulous, with his companion in the reckoning; and so داقّهُ فِى الحِسَابِ;] (JK, K, TA;)<br>\
he reckoned with his companion with minuteness:<br>\
(TK:) it signifies an act between two. (TA.) [And<br>\
داقّهُ فِى الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  He was minute, &amp;c., with him<br>\
in the affair, or case.] المُدَاقَّةُ فِى الأَمْرِ signifies<br>\

وَنَفَقَاتِهِ [He examined minutely into his dealings<br>\

-b2-  And<br>\

in art. دنق.)<br>\
4<br>\
ادقّهُ He made, or rendered, it (a thing,<br>\
S, M) دَقِيق [i. e. thin, or slender, &amp;c.]; (S, M,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ دقّقهُ. (S, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He gave<br>\
him a small thing: (S, TA:) or he gave him<br>\
little: (S in art. جل:) or (tropical:)  he gave him a sheep,<br>\
or goat; (M;) or sheep, or goats. (K, TA.)<br>\
You say, أَتَيْتُهُ فَمَا أَدَقَّنِى وَلَا أَجَلَّنِى (S, M) I came<br>\
to him, and he gave me not a small thing, nor<br>\
gave he me a great thing: (S in the present art.:)<br>\
or he gave me not little, nor gave he me much:<br>\
(S in art. جل:) or he gave me not a sheep, or<br>\
goat, nor gave he me a camel. (M.) ―<br>\

of غَلِيظٌ. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  دِقٌّ in measuring, relating to<br>\

the ground; as also ↓ دُقَاقَةٌ: (TA:) or دُقَقُ<br>\
التُّرَابِ signifies fine dust; and دُقَّةٌ is its sing.:<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  Also Seeds that are used in cooking, for<br>\
seasoning food, (IDrd, M, K,) bruised, or brayed,<br>\

seeds of the cooking-pot are called دُقَّة by the<br>\

such seeds mixed therewith: (M, K:) this is the<br>\
application now commonly obtaining: (TA:)<br>\
or salt alone: (M:) or salt bruised, or brayed:<br>\
(Lth, K:) whence the saying, مَا لَهُ دُقَّةٌ He has<br>\
not salt. (Lth, M, K. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,] (tropical:)  Beauty,<br>\
or prettiness: (M, K, TA:) whence the phrase<br>\

whole, or in its component particles: and sometimes, as applied to a garment or the like, thin,<br>\
or fine, as opposed to thick or coarse; like رَقِيقٌ:<br>\
but properly,] دَقِيقٌ differs from رَقِيقٌ; the former<br>\
signifying the contr. of غَلِيظٌ [as stated above],<br>\
and the latter, the contr. of ثَخِينٌ: therefore one<br>\
says حَسًا رَقِيقٌ and حَسًا ثَخِينٌ [“ thin soup ” and<br>\
“ thick soup ”], but not حَسًا دَقِيقٌ; and one says<br>\
سَيْفٌ دَقِيقُ المَضْرِبِ [a sword thin in the edge, or<br>\

You say, جَرَى الدَّقِيقُ فِى السُّنْبُلِ [The farina<br>\
pervaded the ears of wheat]. (L in art. قمح.)<br>\
