-b2-  دَحَيْتُ الإِبِلَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. as above, (TA,) I drove the camels; (K;)<br>\
as also ذَحَيْتُهَا. (TA.)<br>\

أَدْحَىَmentioned by Freytag as on the authority<br>\

دحو.<br>\
دَحَيْتُهُ A single act of دَحْىٌ, i. e. spreading,<br>\
&amp;c. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  A she-ape, or she-monkey. (K.)<br>\
دِحْيَةٌ A mode, or manner, of دَحْىٌ, i. e. spreading, &amp;c. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  A headman, or chief, (R,<br>\
K, TA,) in an absolute sense, in the dial. of ElYemen, (R, TA,) and particularly, of an army,<br>\
or a military force. (K, TA.) AA says that it<br>\
originally signifies “ a lord,” or “ chief,” in<br>\
Pers.; but seems to be from دَحَاهُ, aor. يَدْحُوهُ,<br>\
meaning “ he spread it, and made it plain or<br>\
even; ” because it is for the headman or chief to<br>\
do this; the و being changed into ى as it is in<br>\
صِبْيَةٌ and فِتْيَةٌ; and if so, it belongs to art. دحو.<br>\
(TA.) [Accord. to Golius, the pl. is دِحَآءٌ; but<br>\
I think that it is more probably دِحًى.] It is<br>\
said in a trad. that what is called البَيْتُ المَعْمُورُ<br>\
[q. v. in art. عمر] is entered every day by seventy<br>\
thousand companies of angels, every one of these<br>\
companies having with it a دِحْيَة and consisting<br>\
of seventy thousand angels. (TA.)<br>\
