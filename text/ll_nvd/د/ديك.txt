(Msb, TA:) pl. (of mult. TA) دِيَكَةٌ and دُيُوكٌ<br>\
(S, Msb, K) and (of pauc. TA) أَدْيَاكٌ. (K.)<br>\
Sometimes it is employed as meaning دَجَاجَةٌ,<br>\
(K,) [which is a n. un., applied to the male and<br>\
to the female,] and is therefore made [grammatically] fem., (TA,) [though still applying to<br>\
the male, agreeably with a common license in the<br>\
case of a masc. noun that has a fem. syn., and<br>\
vice versa,] as in the saying,<br>\
دَجَاجَةٌوَزَّقَتِ الدَّيكُ بِصَوْتٍ زَقَّا<br>\
[And the cock muted with a sound, with vehement<br>\
muting]; (K;) because the ديك is also a دَجَاجَة:<br>\
so says ISd. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  دِيكُ الجِنِّ [The cock of<br>\
the jinn, or genii;] a certain little creeping thing,<br>\
or insect, (دُوَيْبَّة,) found in gardens. (Kzw.)<br>\
And the surname of the poet &#39;Abd-Es-Selám.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
-A2-  Solicitously affectionate; compassionate:<br>\
(K:) or solicitously affectionate; affectionate to<br>\
off spring; applied to a man, in the dial. of ElYemen: so accord. to El-Muärrij; who says<br>\
that hence the ديك [or domestic cock] is thus<br>\
called. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  (assumed tropical:)  The [season called] رَبِيع [here<br>\
meaning spring]; as though so called because of the various colours of its plants, or<br>\
herbage, (K, TA,) and thus likened to the ديك<br>\
[or domestic cock]. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  One, and all, of<br>\
the three stones on which the cooking-pot is<br>\
placed: used alike as sign. and pl. (El-Muärrij,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A5-  The protuberant bone behind the ear of<br>\
the horse: (K:) IKh explains it as meaning a<br>\
certain bone behind the ear; not particularizing a<br>\
horse nor any other animal. (IB.)<br>\
[<br>\
دِيكَةٌ is said by Golius, as on the authority of<br>\
the K, in which it is not found, to be sometimes<br>\
used as signifying A domestic hen.]<br>\
أَرْضٌ مَدَاكَةٌ and مُدَاكَةٌ and ↓ مَدِيكَةٌ A land<br>\
abounding with دِيَكَة [or domestic cocks]. (K.)<br>\
