(assumed tropical:)  upon latent rancour or malevolence: (S and<br>\
TA in art. هدن:) but A&#39;Obeyd, in explaining a<br>\
trad. in which it occurs, takes it from دَخَنٌ as<br>\
signifying “ a duskiness, or dinginess, inclining<br>\
to blackness,” in the colour of a beast or of a<br>\
garment; for he says that it means [a case in<br>\
which] the mutual love of two parties will not<br>\

-b3-  It also means (assumed tropical:)  Dearth, drought,<br>\
sterility, or unfruitfulness; and hunger: and so<br>\
it has been said to mean in the Kur xliv. 9: for<br>\
it is said that the hungry [once] saw smoke<br>\
(دُخَان) between him and the sky: or hunger is<br>\
thus called because of the dryness of the earth in<br>\
drought, and the rising of the dust, which is<br>\
likened to دُخَان [properly so termed]. (TA.) ―<br>\
