(A, Mgh, Msb) and دَفْرٌ, (A,) or the latter is a<br>\
simple subst.; (Mgh, Msb;) and ↓ ادفر; (Msb;)<br>\
It, (a thing, A, Msb,) and he, (a man, TA,)<br>\
stank: (A, Mgh, Msb, K:) [see also دَفْرٌ, below:]<br>\
but some say, of دَفِرٌ, that it is a possessive epithet,<br>\
having no verb pertaining to it: and accord. to<br>\
IAar, ↓ ادفر signifies he (a man) smell of his art.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  دَفِرَ, aor.<br>\
دَفَرَ, (TK,) inf. n. دَفَرٌ, (K,) or<br>\
دَفْرٌ, (M,) It (food, or wheat, M, K, and flesh-meat, M, TA) became maggotty. (M, K, TK.) ―<br>\

دَفْرٌ (T, S, M, A, Msb, K) and ↓ دَفَرٌ, (IAar,<br>\
M, A, K,) the former a simple subst., and the<br>\
latter an inf. n., (Msb,) or both inf. ns., (A,)<br>\
and ↓ دَفْرَةٌ, (Msb,) Stink; stench: (IAar, T, S,<br>\
M, A, Msb, K:) never used to signify a sweet<br>\
smell: (M:) accord. to Aboo- ” Alee El-Kálee,<br>\
↓ دَفَرٌ has the above-mentioned signification; but<br>\
دَفْرٌ signifies pungency of odour, whether stinking<br>\
or sweet: other authorities, however, assert,<br>\
accord. to what is transmitted from them, that<br>\
the word signifying intense pungency of odour,<br>\
whether sweet or bad, is ذَفَرٌ, with ذ, and with two<br>\
fet-hahs, whence مِسْكٌ أَذْفَرُ: I Aar says that ↓ ذَفَرٌ<br>\
signifies stink, or stench; and ذَفْرٌ, baseness, or<br>\
vileness; but this is not known on any other<br>\
authority. (M, L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the saying of<br>\
&#39;Omar, وَدَفْرَاهْ, meaning [Alas, what stench! i. e.,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Alas, what an abominable thing! i. e.] وَانَتْنَاهْ:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, T, S, M:) or it means Alas, what<br>\
baseness, or vileness! (IAar, T, M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence<br>\
also the phrase, دَفْرًا لَهُ, meaning [May God make<br>\
stench to cleave to him, or it! i. e., (assumed tropical:)  Fy, or shame,<br>\
upon him, or it! i. e.] نَتْنًا لَهُ: (S, Mgh:) and<br>\
لِمَا يَجِىْءُ بِهِ فُلَانٌ↓دَفْرًا دَفِرًا, (T, * S, M,) meaning<br>\
[May foul stench cleave to that which such a one<br>\
doth! i. e., (assumed tropical:)  Foul shame upon it! i. e.] نَتْنًا;<br>\
(S, M;) but in an intensive sense; (M;) said in<br>\
declaring a man&#39;s case, or affair, to be bad, or<br>\
abominable. (T, S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Hence, too, الدَّفْرُ, (TA,)<br>\
and أُمُّ دَفْرٍ, (S, K,) (assumed tropical:)  Calamity, or misfortune.<br>\
(S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And أُمُّ دَفْرٍ, (T, S, A, K,) written by Aboo-&#39;Alee El-Kálee ↓ أُمُّ دَفَرٍ, but this is<br>\
wrong, (R,) and ↓ أُمُّ دَفْرَةَ, (IAar,) and ↓ دَفَارِ, and<br>\
