دُنَيْنِيرٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
دِينَارٌ, an arabicized word, (M, K,) from the<br>\
Persian [دِينَارْ], (M,) or from دِينْ آرْ, meaning<br>\
“ the law brought it ” [into being or circulation]:<br>\
(Er-Rághib:) some say, (TA,) its original is<br>\
دِنَّارٌ; one of its ن being changed into ى (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) to render it more easy to be pronounced,<br>\
(Msb,) or that it may not be confounded with<br>\
inf. ns., such as كِذَّابٌ; (S, K;) and hence its<br>\
pl. is دَنَانِيرُ, (M, Msb,) and its dim. ↓ دُنَيْنِيرٌ:<br>\
(M:) this is the opinion generally obtaining:<br>\
others say that it is of the measure فِيعَالٌ; but<br>\
this opinion is contradicted by the absence of the<br>\
ى in [the second syllable of] the pl.; for were<br>\
it so, its pl. would be like دَيَامِيسُ, pl. of دِيمَاسٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) [it is the name of A certain gold coin;]<br>\
its weight is seventy-one barley-corns and a half,<br>\
nearly, reckoning the دَانِق as eight grains of<br>\
wheat and two fifths; but if it be said that the<br>\
دانق is eight grains of wheat, then the دينار is<br>\
sixty-eight grains of wheat and four sevenths: it<br>\
is the same as the مَثْقَال. (Msb.)<br>\
شَرَابٌ دِينَارِىٌّ A kind of wine or beverage, so<br>\
called in relation to Ibn-Deenár el-Hakeem, or<br>\
because like the دينار in its redness. (TA.)<br>\
مُدَنَّرٌ, applied to a دِينَار, (M, K,) and to gold,<br>\

or having a spotting (↓ تَدْنِير) of black intermixed<br>\

(TA:) and of a white colour predominating over<br>\
blackness, with a round blackness intermixed with<br>\
the former colour upon his back and rump: (M:)<br>\
