دَنِفَ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
دَنَفَ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. دَنَفٌ; (M, Msb;) and ↓ ادنف; (S, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) or, accord. to Sb, one does not<br>\
say دَنِفَ, though they sometimes said دَنِفٌ, for<br>\
he regarded this as a possessive epithet; (M;)<br>\
said of a sick man, (S, Mgh, K,) He had a<br>\
constant, or chronic, disease: (Msb: [see دَنَفٌ,<br>\
below:]) or he was, or became, heavy, (S, Mgh,<br>\
K, TA,) by reason of disease, (Mgh, TA,) and<br>\
near to death, (Mgh,) or at the point of death:<br>\
(TA:) or he became emaciated by disease so as to<br>\
be at the point of death. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,]<br>\
دَنِفَتِ الشَّمْسُ, and ↓ ادنفت, (tropical:)  The sun was near<br>\
to setting, and became yellow. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And دَنِفَ الأَمْرُ (tropical:)  The thing, or event, was, or<br>\
became, near (K, TA) to passing. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
ادنف: see 1, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  ادنفهُ, said of<br>\
a disease, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) It rendered him<br>\
constantly, or chronically, ill; or clave to him<br>\
constantly: (Msb:) or it rendered him heavy [so<br>\
that he was near to death, or at the point of<br>\
death: see 1]: (S, Mgh, K:) or, said of God,<br>\
He caused him to become emaciated by disease so<br>\
as to be at the point of death. (M.) Thus the<br>\
verb is trans. as well as intrans. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And أَدْنَفْتُ الأَمْرَ (tropical:)  I caused the thing, or event, to<br>\
be near, or brought it near, (K, TA,) to passing.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
دَنَفٌ A constant, or chronic, disease; (S, M,<br>\
K;) such as infects, or pervades, the person or the<br>\
inside: or, as some say, any disease, whatever it<br>\
be. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (S, M, K,) and ↓ دَنِفٌ, (S,<br>\
M, Msb, K,) the latter held by Sb to be a possessive epithet, as he disallowed the verb دَنِفَ, (M,)<br>\
A man having a constant, or chronic, disease;<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K;) such as infects, or pervades, his<br>\
person or his inside: or, accord. to some, having<br>\
any disease: or emaciated by disease so as to be<br>\
at the point of death: and ↓ مُدْنَفٌ and ↓ مُدْنِفٌ<br>\
signify the same: (M:) or these two signify<br>\
rendered heavy by disease [so as to be near to<br>\
death, or at the point of death: see 1]: (S, Mgh,<br>\
K:) [and Freytag adds ↓ دَانِفٌ, explained as<br>\
meaning “ interitui obnoxius,” as from the Ham;<br>\
in which I only find (p. 624) authority for دَنِفٌ,<br>\
signifying being at the point of death or destruction:] دَنَفٌ is used alike as masc. (Fr, T, S,<br>\
M, K) and fem. (S, M, K) and sing. (Fr, T, S,<br>\
M, K) and dual (S, M) and pl., (Fr, T, S, M,<br>\
K,) as though it were an inf. n. used as an<br>\
epithet: (M:) but if you say ↓ دَنِفٌ, you vary it<br>\
for the fem. and dual and pl., (T, * S, M, K,)<br>\
saying اِمْرَأَةٌ دَنِفَةٌ, (S, M,) &amp;c., (S,) i. e., saying<br>\
also رَجُلَانِ دَنِفَانِ, (TA,) and قَوْمٌ أَدْنَافٌ, (M,) or<br>\
رِجَالٌ أَدْنَافٌ: (TA:) and sometimes دَنَفٌ has a<br>\
dual form and a pl.; (K;) [i. e.] one may say<br>\
أَخَوَاكَ دَنَفَانِ and إِخْوَتُكَ أَدْنَافُ. (Fr, T.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Applied to the sun, it means (tropical:)  Near to setting,<br>\
(M, TA,) and (TA) becoming yellow. (T, TA.)<br>\
So in the saying (of El-&#39;Ajjáj, T, TA),<br>\
وَالشَّمْسُ قَدْ كَادَتْ تَكُونُ دَنَفَا<br>\
(tropical:)  [And the sun had almost become near to setting,<br>\
and to turning yellow]. (T, M, TA.) [See Q. 2<br>\
in art. زحلف.]<br>\
