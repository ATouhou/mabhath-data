دَعَوْتُ and<br>\
دَعَيْتُ signify the same: (Fr, K<br>\
and TA in art. دعى:) the aor. of the former is<br>\
أَدْعُو, (TA in that art.,) sec. pers. fem. sing.<br>\
تَدْعِينَ and تَدْعُوِينَ and تَدٌعُيْنَ, the last with an<br>\
inclination to the sound of a dammeh in the<br>\
vowel of the ع [so that it is between a kesreh and<br>\
a dammeh], and sec. pers. masc. and fem. pl.<br>\
تَدْعُونَ: (S, TA:) aor. of the latter verb أَدْعِى:<br>\
inf. n. دُعَآءٌ. (TA in art. دعى.) دُعَآءٌ [generally]<br>\
signifies [or implies] The act of seeking, desiring,<br>\
asking, or demanding. (KT.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say, دَعَا<br>\
اللّٰهَ, (K,) first pers. دَعَوْتُ, aor. أَدْعُو, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. دُعَآءٌ (Msb, K) and دَعْوَى, (K,) in which<br>\
latter the alif [written ى] is to denote the fem.<br>\
gender, [and therefore the word is without tenween,] (TA,) He prayed to God, supplicated<br>\
Him, or petitioned Him humbly, (Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
desiring to obtain some good that He had to<br>\
bestow. (Msb, TA.) And دَعَوْتُ اللّٰهَ لَهُ [I prayed<br>\
to God for him]; and عَلَيْهِ [against him]; inf. n.<br>\

-b4-<br>\
[Hence,] دَعَا بِهِ, said of anything in the earth,<br>\
means It needed it; or required it: [and so<br>\
دَعَا إِلَيْهِ: one says of a wall, دَعَا إِلَى إِصْلَاحِهِ It<br>\
needed, or required, its being repaired: (see 10<br>\
in art. رم:) and] one says to him whose clothes<br>\
have become old and worn out, قَدْ دَعَتْ ثِيَابُكَ<br>\
[Thy clothes have become such as to need thy<br>\
putting on others; or] thou hast become in need<br>\
of putting on other clothes. (Aboo-&#39;Adnán, TA.)<br>\
[See also 10.] ―<br>\
-b5-  دَعَوْتُهُ, (S, MA, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
and دَعَوْتُ بِهِ, (MA, [and of frequent occurrence,])<br>\
inf. n. [دُعَآءٌ and] دَعْوٌ, (TA, [but the former is<br>\
more common,]) also signify I called him, called<br>\
out to him, or summoned him, (S, MA, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) syn. نَادَيْتُهُ, (Mgh, Msb,) or الدُّعَآءُ is to the<br>\
near and النِّدَآءُ is to the distant, (Kull p. 184,)<br>\
and desired him to come, to come forward, or<br>\
to advance; (Msb;) and ↓ اِسْتَدْعَيْتُهُ signifies the<br>\
same, (S, MA,) [i. e.] I called him to myself. (MA.) One says, دَعَا المُؤَذِّنُ النَّاسَ إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ<br>\
[The مؤذّن called the people to prayer]. (Msb.)<br>\
And the saying of En-Nahdee كُنَّا نَدْعُو وَنَدَعُ<br>\
means We used to call, or invite, them to ElIslám at one time, and to leave doing so at<br>\
another time. (Mgh.) And دَعَوْتُ النَّاسَ, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. دُعَآءٌ and دَعْوَةٌ, (S,) or the latter is a simple<br>\
subst., (Msb,) and مَدْعَاةٌ, (S, [app. there mentioned as an inf. n., agreeably with many other<br>\
instances,]) means also I invited people to eat<br>\
with me, or at my abode. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [Hence,]<br>\
مَا دَعَاكَ إِلَى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ What drew, led, induced,<br>\
or caused, and constrained, or drove, thee to do<br>\
this thing? (TA.) And دَعَانَا غَيْثٌ وَقَعَ بِبَلَدٍ قَدْ<br>\
أَمْرَعَ, i. e. [Rain that fell in a region which had<br>\
become abundant in herbage invited us thither,<br>\
or] was the cause of our seeking its herbage.<br>\
(TA.) And يَدْعُومَا بَعْدَهُ, (S, Mgh, K, *) or<br>\
يَدْعُومَا وَرَآءَهُ مِنَ اللَّبَنِ, (Nh, TA,) [It draws,<br>\
or attracts, what is to come after it, of the milk,]<br>\
said of some milk left in the udder. (S, Nh,<br>\
Mgh, K, TA.) And دَعَاهُ إِلَى الأَمِيرِ He drove<br>\
him, or urged him to go, [but more commonly<br>\
meaning he summoned him,] to the prince, or<br>\
commander. (K, * TA. [In the TK, الى الأَمْرِ<br>\
to the thing, or affair.]) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence likewise,]<br>\
الدُّعَآءُ signifies also The calling to one&#39;s aid:<br>\
thus, [in the Kur ii. 21,] وَادْعُوا شُهَدَآءَكُمْ means<br>\
And call ye to your aid [your helpers]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  And دَعَا المَيِّتَ He called upon the dead,<br>\
praising him, and saying, Alas for such a one!<br>\
or he wailed for, wept for, or deplored the loss<br>\
of, the dead, and enumerated his good qualities<br>\

[See also 5.]) ―<br>\
-b9-  And دَعَوْتُهُ زَيْدًا and بِزَيْدٍ (tropical:)  I<br>\
called him, i. e. named him, Zeyd. (Msb, K,<br>\
TA.) And دَعَوْتُهُ بِابْنِ زَيْدٍ (assumed tropical:)  I called him, i. e.<br>\
asserted him to be, the son of Zeyd. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
دَعَاهُ اللّٰهُ (assumed tropical:)  God destroyed him: [as though He<br>\
called him away:] whence تَدْعُو مَنْ أَدْبَرَ وَتَوَلَّى,<br>\
in the Kur lxx. 17, [describing the fire of Hell,]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  It shall destroy him who shall have gone back<br>\
from the truth and turned away from obedience:<br>\
or this means (tropical:)  it shall draw, and bring, &amp;c.: or<br>\
it refers to the زَبَانِيَة of Hell [i. e. the tormentors<br>\
of the damned]: (Bd:) or it means (assumed tropical:)  it will do<br>\
to them hateful deeds. (TA.) [Also] God<br>\
punished him, or tormented him. (TA.) And<br>\
دَعَاهُ اللّٰهُ بِمَكْرُوهٍ (tropical:)  God caused an evil, or abominable, event to befall him. (ISd, Z, K.) ―<br>\
-b11-  دَعَا<br>\
فِى الضَّرْعِ (tropical:)  He left some milk, such as is termed<br>\
دَاعِيَة, in the udder. (M, K, TA.) Accord. to<br>\
IAth, دَاعِيَةٌ is an inf. n., like عَاقِبَةٌ and عَافِيَةٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
مُدَاعَاةٌ signifies (tropical:)  The proposing an enigma<br>\
or enigmas to a person; or the contending with<br>\
another in doing so; syn. مُحَاجَاةٌ. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
You say, دَاعَيْتُهُ (tropical:)  I proposed to him an enigma or<br>\
enigmas; &amp;c. (TA.) A poet says,<br>\
أُدَاعِيكَ مَا مُسْتَصْحَبَاتٌ مَعَ السُّرَى<br>\
حِسَانٌ وَمَا آثَارُهَا بِحِسَانِ<br>\

that are taken as companions in night-journeying,<br>\
good, and the effects whereof are not good?]:<br>\

down, or demolished, the wall upon them, from<br>\
the sides [or foundations] thereof. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
[Golius assigns other significations to دَاعَى, for<br>\
which I find no authority: namely, “Convocavit<br>\
ad Deum propheta, præco sacer,” followed by an<br>\
accus.: and “ Contendit contra alium: Provocavit:<br>\
pecul. rem vindicans sibi vel arrogans. ”]<br>\
4<br>\
أَدْعَاهُ [so in some copies of the K; in other<br>\
copies ↓ اِدَّعَاهُ; the former of which I regard as<br>\
the right reading;] He made him to assert his<br>\
relationship as a son [for يُدْعَى, in my copies of<br>\
the K, I read ↓ يَدَّعِى, syn. with يَعْتَزِى,] to one<br>\
who was not his father. (K.) [SM, who appears<br>\
to have read ↓ اِدَّعَاهُ, says that it is like اِسْتَلْحَقَهُ<br>\
and اِسْتَلَاطَهُ.]<br>\
5<br>\
التَّدَعِّى [inf. n. of تَدَعَّتْ] signifies The<br>\
تَطْرِيب [or singing, or quavering or trilling and<br>\

dead. (TA. [See دَعَا المَيِّتَ, above.])<br>\
6<br>\
التَّدَاعِى signifies The calling, summoning,<br>\

تَدَاعَوْ لِلْحَرْبِ [They called, summoned, or convoked, one another for war: and hence,] (assumed tropical:)  they<br>\
prepared themselves for war. (TA.) And تَدَاعَوْا<br>\
عَلَيْهِ, (Msb, K,) or عَلَى بَنِى فُلَانٍ, (T, M,) They<br>\
collected themselves together, (K,) or called one<br>\
another so that they assembled together, (M,) or<br>\
leagued together, and called one another to<br>\
mutual aid, (T, Msb, *) against him, (Msb, K,)<br>\
or against the sons of such a one. (T, M.) And<br>\
تَدَاعَى عَلَيْهِ العَدُوُّ مِنْ كُلِّ جَانِبٍ (assumed tropical:)  The enemy<br>\
advanced against him from every side. (K, *<br>\

مِنْ كُلِّ جَانِبٍ (assumed tropical:)  The cloud lightened and thundered from every quarter. (TA.) And تَدَاعَى<br>\

(Msb, TA:) or cracked in several places, without<br>\

(Mgh,) the walls cracked in several places, without falling: (Mgh, K: *) and تَدَاعَتِ الحِيطَانُ<br>\
لِلْخَرَابِ the walls fell to ruin by degrees; syn.<br>\
تَهَادَمَت: (S:) [but Mtr says,] تَدَاعَتْ إِلَى الخَرَابِ<br>\
is a vulgar phrase; not [genuine] Arabic. (Mgh.)<br>\
And تداعى said of a sand-hill, (assumed tropical:)  It, being put in<br>\
notion, or shaken in its lower part, poured down.<br>\
(Msb.) And [hence,] تَدَاعَتْ إِبِلُ بَنِى فُلَانٍ (tropical:) (tropical:)  The<br>\
camels of such a one became broken by emaciation. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  تَدَاعَوْ بِالأَلْقَابِ They called one<br>\

-A2-<br>\
[It is also used transitively:] you say, تَدَاعَوُا القَوْمَ<br>\
They [together] called the people. (Mgh in art.<br>\
نقض. [See 6 in that art.])<br>\
7<br>\
اندعى i. q. أَجَابَ. (K.) Akh heard one<br>\
or more of the Arabs say, لَوْدَعَوْنَا لَانْدَعَيْنَا, meaning لَأَجُبْنَا [i. e. Had they called us, &amp;c., we had<br>\
certainly answered, or replied, or assented, or<br>\
consented]. (S.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِدَّعَى He asserted a thing to be his, or to<br>\
belong to him, or to be due to him, either truly or<br>\
falsely: (K, * TA:) he claimed a thing; laid<br>\
claim to it; or demanded it for himself: and he<br>\
desired a thing; or wished for it. (Msb.) And<br>\
اِدَّعَوُا الشَّىْءَ and الشىء ↓ تَدَاعَوُا signify the same<br>\
[i. e. They claimed the thing, every one of them<br>\
for himself]. (Mgh.) You say, اِدَّعَيْتُ عَلَى فُلَانٍ<br>\
كَذَا [I asserted myself to have a claim upon<br>\
such a one for such a thing; preferred a claim<br>\
against such a one for such a thing; or claimed<br>\
of such a one such a thing]. (S.) And اِدَّعَى زَيْدٌ<br>\
عَلَى عَمْرو مَالًا [Zeyd asserted himself to have a<br>\
claim upon &#39;Amr for property; or preferred a<br>\
claim against &#39;Amr &amp;c.]. (Mgh.) And اِدَّعَيْتَ<br>\
عَلَىَّ مَا لَمْ أَفْعَلْ [Thou hast asserted against me,<br>\
or charged against me, or accused me of, that<br>\
which I have not done]. (S and K in art. شرب,<br>\
and S in art. اكل.) هٰذَا الَّذِى كُنْتُمْ بِهِ تَدَّعُونَ,<br>\
in the Kur [lxvii. 27], means This is that on<br>\
account of which ye used to assert vain and false<br>\
things: or which ye used to deny, or disbelieve:<br>\
or, accord. to Fr, the latter verb may here be<br>\
used in the sense of تَدْعُونَ; and the meaning<br>\
may be, this is that which ye desired to hasten,<br>\
and for which ye prayed to God in the words of<br>\
the Kur [viii. 32], “O God, if this be the truth<br>\
from Thee, then rain Thou upon us stones from<br>\
Heaven, or bring upon us some [other] painful<br>\
punishment: ” it may be from الدُّعَآءُ: and it may<br>\
be from الدَّعْوَى: (TA:) [i. e.] it means this is<br>\
that which ye used to demand, and desire to hasten;<br>\
from الدُّعَآءُ: or that which ye used to assert,<br>\
[namely,] that there will be no raising to life;<br>\
from الدَّعْوَى. (Bd.) And وَلَهُمْ مَا يَدَّعُونَ, in the<br>\
Kur [xxxvi. 57], is explained as meaning And<br>\
they shall have what they desire, or wish for;<br>\
which is referrible to the meaning of الدُّعَآءُ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also, اِدَّعَى غَيْرَ أَبِيهِ [He<br>\
asserted the relationship of father to him of one<br>\

And يَدَّعِى إِلَى غَيْرِ أَبِيهِ [He asserts his relationship as a son, or claims the relationship of a son,<br>\
to one who is not his father]. (T, Msb. See 4,<br>\
in three places.) And يَدَّعِيهِ غَيْرُ أَبِيهِ [One who<br>\
is not his father asserts him to be his son; or<br>\
claims him as his son]. (T, Msb.) الاِدِّعَآءُ in<br>\
war signifies The asserting one&#39;s relationship;<br>\
syn. الاِعْتِزَآءُ; (S, TA;) as also ↓ التَّدَاعِى;<br>\
(TA;) i. e. the saying “ I am such a one the<br>\
son of such a one. ” (S.) And [hence] sometimes it includes the meaning of Informing, or<br>\
telling; and therefore بِ may be prefixed to<br>\
its objective complement; so that one says, فُلَانٌ<br>\
يَدَّعِى بِكَرَمِ فِعَالِهِ, i. e. Such a one informs of the<br>\
generosity of his deeds. (Msb.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَدْعَوَ see 1, near the middle of the paragraph.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, استدعى signifies also It called for,<br>\
demanded, required, or invited, a thing. See<br>\
also دَعَابِهِ.]<br>\
دَعْوَةٌ [as an inf. n. of un.] signifies A single<br>\
time or act (S, Msb) [of prayer and of imprecation, as is indicated in the S, and also, though<br>\
less plainly, in the TA]. See دُعَآءٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also, as<br>\
such, A call.] You say, هُوَمِنِّى دَعْوَةُ الرَّجُلَ (K,<br>\
TA) and الكَلْبِ, and دَعْوَةَ الرَّجُلِ and الكَلْبِ, in the<br>\
former case دعوة being used as a simple subst.,<br>\
and in the latter case as an adv. n., (TA,) meaning قَدْرُ مَا بَيْنِى وَبَيْنَهُ ذَاكَ [i. e. He, or it, is<br>\
distant from me the space of the call of the man<br>\
and of the dog]. (K, TA.) And لَهُمُ الدَّعْوَةُ عَلَى<br>\
غَيْرِهِمْ The call is to them before the others of them:<br>\
(K, TA: [يَبْدَأُ in the CK is a mistake for يُبْدَأُ:])<br>\
accord. to the T and the Nh, in the case of gifts,<br>\
or pay, or salary. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The call to prayer:<br>\
whence, in a trad., الدَّعُوَةُ فِى الحَبَشَةِ [meaning<br>\
The office of calling to prayer rests among the<br>\
Abyssinians]; (JM, TA;) said by the Prophet<br>\
in preference of his مُؤَذِّن Bilál. (JM.) ―<br>\
-b4-  A<br>\
call, or an invitation, to El-Islám. (Mgh.) You<br>\
say, أَدْعُوكَ بِدَعْوَةِ الإِسْلَامِ and السلام ↓ دِعَايَةِ and<br>\
الاسلام ↓ دَاعِيَةِ, meaning I call thee, or invite<br>\
thee, by the declaration of the faith whereby the<br>\
people of false religions are called: دَاعِيَةٌ being<br>\
an inf. n. syn. with دَعْوَةٌ, like عَافِيَةٌ and عَاقِبَةٌ:<br>\
(JM:) دَعْوَةُ الإِسْلَامِ and ↓ دَعايَتُهُ and ↓ دَاعِيَتُهُ signify the same: and دَعْوَةُ الحَقِّ [in like manner]<br>\
means the declaration that there is no deity but<br>\
God. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  An invitation to food, (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K, TA,) and to beverage; or, accord. to<br>\
Lh, specially a repast, feast, or banquet, on the<br>\
occasion of a wedding or the like: (TA:) thus<br>\
pronounced by most of the Arabs, except &#39;Adee<br>\
of Er-Rabáb, who pronounce it, in this sense,<br>\
↓ دِعْوَةٌ: (A &#39;Obeyd, S, M, Msb:) it is an inf. n.<br>\
in this sense, (S,) or a simple subst.: (Msb:)<br>\
and ↓ دُعْوَةٌ signifies the same; (K;) or, as some<br>\
say, this, which is given as on the authority of<br>\
Ktr, is a mistake: (TA:) and so does ↓ مَدْعَاةٌ<br>\
[app. an inf. n.]. (S, Msb, K.) You say, كُنَّافِى<br>\
دَعْوَةِ فُلَانٍ and ↓ مَدْعَاتِهِ, meaning [We were included in] the invitation (دُعَآء [see 1]) of such a<br>\
one to food: (S, Msb: [but in the latter, نَحْنُ,<br>\
in the place of كُنَّا:]) [or we were at the repast,<br>\
or feast, or banquet, of such a one; for] you say<br>\
[also] دَعَاهُ إِلَى الدَّعْوَةِ and ↓ الى المَدْعَاةِ [He<br>\
invited him to the repast, or feast, or banquet:<br>\
and in this sense دَعْوَة is commonly used in the<br>\
present day]. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See also دِعْوَةٌ: ―<br>\
-b7-  and<br>\
دَعْوَى. ―<br>\
-b8-  Also i. q. حَلِفٌ or حَلْفٌ (accord. to<br>\
different copies of the K) [both in the sense of<br>\
Confederation to aid or assist]: (K, TA:)<br>\
[whence] one says, دَعْوَةٌ فُلَانٍ فِى بَنِى فُلَانٍ<br>\
[meaning The confederation of such a one is with<br>\
the sons of such a one]. (TA.)<br>\
دُعْوَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
دِعْوَةٌ respects relationship, (S, Msb,) like ↓ دَعْوَى<br>\
or دَعْوَى فِى النَّسَبِ; (S;) meaning A claim in<br>\
respect of relationship; (K;) [i. e.] one&#39;s claiming as his father a person who is not his father;<br>\
(Az, Mgh, Msb;) [in other words,] one&#39;s claiming the relationship of a son to a person who is<br>\
not his father: or one&#39;s being claimed as a son<br>\
by a person who is not his father: (Az, Msb:)<br>\
thus pronounced by most of the Arabs, except<br>\
&#39;Adee of Er-Rabáb, who pronounce it, in this<br>\
sense, ↓ دَعْوَةٌ. (S, Msb.) See also دَعْوَى. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also Kindred, or relationship, and brotherhood:<br>\
so in the saying, لِى فِىالقَوْمِ دِعْوَةٌ [I have in, or<br>\
among, the people, or company of men, kindred,<br>\
or relationship, and brotherhood]. (Ks, Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  See also دَعْوَةٌ.<br>\
دَعْوَى: see دُعَآءٌ, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also a<br>\
subst. from 8; (S, M, Mgh, Msb, TA;) omitted<br>\
in the K, though better known than the sun;<br>\
(TA;) and so ↓ دَعَاوَةٌ (M, Msb, K) and ↓ دِعَاوَةٌ<br>\
and ↓ دِعْوَةٌ, (M, K,) accord. to the general pronunciation, (M, TA,) and ↓ دَعْوَةٌ, (M, K,) accord.<br>\
to the pronunciation of &#39;Adee of Er-Rabáb, (M,<br>\
TA,) and ↓ دَاعِيَةٌ; (TA, there said to be syn.<br>\
with دَعْوَى;) [meaning An assertion that a<br>\
thing belongs to one, or is due to one; a claim;<br>\
as is indicated in the S and Mgh and K &amp;c.;] a<br>\
demand; a suit; (Yz, Az, Msb;) whether true<br>\
or false: (Mgh, K, TA:) the pl. of دَعْوَى is<br>\
دَعَاوٍ and دَعَاوَى; the former of which is preferable accord. to some, being, as IJ says, the<br>\
original form; but some say that the latter is<br>\
preferable: (Msb:) [the latter only is mentioned<br>\
in the Mgh:] the alif in the sing. [written ى]<br>\
is a sign of the fem. gender; and therefore the<br>\
word is without tenween. (Mgh.) Yz mentions<br>\
the sayings, لِى فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ دَعْوَى I have, in<br>\
respect of this thing, [a claim or] a demand, and<br>\
دَعَاوَى or دَعَاوٍ [claims or] demands, as written in<br>\
different copies. (Az, Msb.) And لَوْ أُعْطِىَ النَّاسُ<br>\

claims, or demands,] occurs in a trad. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  See also دِعْوَةٌ.<br>\
دُعْوِىٌّ is a word used only in negative sentences: (S:) you say, مَا بِالدَّارِ دُعْوِىٌّ There is<br>\
not in the house any one: (S, K: *) Ks says that<br>\
it is from دَعَوْتُ, and [properly] means لَيْسَ فِيهَا<br>\
مَنْ يَدْعُو [there is not in it one who calls, &amp;c.].<br>\
(S.)<br>\
دُعَآءٌ is an inf. n. of 1; (Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ دَعْوَى: (K:) the former is originally دُعَاوٌ:<br>\
(S:) [both, used as simple substs., signify A<br>\
prayer, or supplication, to God:] and the pl. of<br>\
the former is أَدْعِيَةٌ. (S.) IF says that some of<br>\
the Arabs, for ↓ دَعْوَةٌ, say ↓ دَعْوَى, with the fem.<br>\
alif [written ى]. (Msb, TA.) One says, اَللّٰهُمَّ<br>\
المُسْلِمِينَ ↓ أَشْرِكْنَا فِى دَعْوَى, meaning [O God,<br>\
make us to share] in the prayer (دُعَآء) of the<br>\
Muslims. (TA.) And hence, in the Kur [x. 10],<br>\
فِيهَا سُبْحَانَك اللّٰهُمَّ ↓ دَعْوَاهُمْ [Their prayer in it<br>\
shall be سبحانك اللّٰهمّ]. (TA.) [دُعَآءٌ followed<br>\
by لِ signifies An invocation of good, a blessing,<br>\
or a benediction: followed by عَلَى, an imprecation of evil, a curse, or a malediction.] سُورَهُ الدُّعَآءِ<br>\
is a title of The first chapter of the Kur-án.<br>\
(Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] دُعَآءٌ signifies also Adoration,<br>\
worship, or religious service. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And i. q.<br>\
إِيمَانٌ [i. e. Belief; particularly in God, and in<br>\
his word and apostles &amp;c.: faith: &amp;c.]: a meaning mentioned by the Expositors of El-Bukháree.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\

one who is claimed as a son by a person who is<br>\
not his father; (Az, Msb;) an adopted son:<br>\
(S, K:) pl. أَدْئِيَآءُ, (S,) which is anomalous; (Bd<br>\
in xxxiii. 4;) occurring in the Kur [in the verse<br>\
just referred to], where it is said, وَمَاجَعَلَ<br>\
أَدْئِيَاءَكُمْ أَبْنَآءَكُمْ (S) Nor hath He made your<br>\
adopted sons to be your sons in reality. (Jel.)<br>\
―<br>\

or invites, to obey a right or a wrong religion:<br>\
(TA:) pl. دُعَاةٌ (Mgh, Msb, TA) and دَاعُونَ.<br>\
(Msb, TA.) [Hence,] دَاعِى اللّٰهِ [God&#39;s summoner, or inviter; i. e.] the prophet: (K:) and<br>\
also, (Msb, K,) or simply الدَّاعِى, (TA,) The<br>\

signify (tropical:)  A mean, or means; a cause; or a<br>\
motive; (Har p. 306;) [as also ↓ دَاعٍ, often used<br>\
