a thing, one part upon another; (K;) as also<br>\

R. Q. 2<br>\
تَدَهْدَهَ, said of a stone, (S, K,) &amp;c.,<br>\
(S,) It rolled down; (S,* K,* TA;) as also<br>\
تَدَهْدَى. (S, K.) ―<br>\

إِلَّا دَهْ فَلَا دَهْ, (JK, and so in some copies of<br>\
the K,) or إِلَّا دَهٍ فَلَا دَهٍ, (As, IAar, S, TA, and<br>\
so in copies of the K,) a saying of the Arabs,<br>\
meaning If this thing be not now, it will not be<br>\
after the present time: (As, S, K:) As says, I<br>\
know not its origin, but I think it to be Pers.,<br>\
and to mean, if thou strike not him, or it, now,<br>\
thou wilt not strike him, or it, ever: (S:) accord.<br>\
to IAar, it is said to a man when he is at the<br>\
point of accomplishing his want in respect of a<br>\
creditor of his, or in respect of his blood-revenge,<br>\
or in respect of paying honour to a friend of his;<br>\
(TA;) and means if thou seize not the opportunity now, thou wilt never meet with it: (K,<br>\
TA:) accord. to Lth, (TA,) it means, if thou<br>\
avenge not his blood, or if thou slay him not in<br>\
blood-revenge, now, thou wilt never do so. (JK,<br>\
TA.) Accord. to As, one says also, لَا دَهٍ فَلَا دَهٍ,<br>\
meaning I will not accept either of the two<br>\
actions proposed. (TA.) Az says that this saying shows ده to be Pers., and to mean The act of<br>\
striking: you say to a man, ↓ دِهْ, meaning<br>\
Strike thou: and he says, I have seen it written<br>\
with kesr in the book of AZ. (TA.) ↓ دِهْ in<br>\
Pers. means Give thou: and metonymically, the<br>\
act of striking. (TA.)<br>\
دُهْ دُهْ A cry by which camels are chidden;<br>\
(IAar, TA;) a cry by which camels are called to<br>\
their young ones. (K in art. دوه.)<br>\
-A2-  دُهْ دُرَّيْنِ,<br>\
or دُهْ دُرَّيْنْ: see art. دهدر.<br>\
دِهْ: see دَهْ, last two sentences.<br>\
دَهْدَهَةٌ A hundred camels, and more; (JK,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ دَهْدَهَانٌ and ↓ دُهَيْدِهَانٌ: (K:) or<br>\
↓ the second of these three words signifies many<br>\
camels. (JK, S.)<br>\
دَهْدَهَانٌ: see what next precedes, in two<br>\
places: and what next follows.<br>\
دَهْدَاءٌ Small, or young, camels: (JK, S, K:)<br>\
pl. دَهَادِهُ. (S, * K.) A rájiz says,<br>\
قُلَيِّصَاتٍ وَأُبَيْكِرِينَا  ↓ قَدْ رَوِيَتْ إِلَّا دُهَيْدِهِينَا<br>\
[They had satisfied their thirst, except some<br>\
small, or young, camels; little young she-camels<br>\
and little young he-camels]: as though he formed<br>\
from دَهْدَاهٌ the pl. دَهَادِهُ; and from this, the<br>\
dim. دُهَيْدِهٌ; and from this, the pl. دُهَيْدِهِينَ [in<br>\
the nom. case دُهَيْدِهوُنَ]: (S, TA:*) and in like<br>\
manner, أُبَيْكِرِينَ as pl. of أُبَيْكِرٌ, dim. of أَبْكُرٌ, pl.<br>\
of بَكْرٌ. (S.) [Accord. to a passage imperfectly<br>\
written in the TA, it seems to signify also Many<br>\
small, or young, camels; and so, as there written,<br>\
دهدان, app. for ↓ دَهْدَهَانٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also,<br>\
مَا أَدْرِى أَىٌّ الدَّهْدَاهِ هُوَ, (TA,) or الدَّهْدَأِ and<br>\
الدَّهْدَآءِ, the last on the authority of Ks, meaning<br>\
I know not what one of men he is. (S, TA.)<br>\
دُهْدُوهٌ, (K, [accord. to the TA دُهْدُوَهٌ, but this<br>\
is a mistake,]) or دُهْدُوهَةٌ, (IB,) The thing which<br>\
the جُعَل [or species of black beetle called cantharus] rolls, (IB, K, TA,) consisting of dung<br>\
which it collects, (IB, TA,) in a round form;<br>\
(TA;) and so دُهْدُوَّةٌ and دُهْدِيَّةٌ, [the last of<br>\
these, for alleviation of the utterance,] also without teshdeed. (IAar, K.)<br>\
دُهَيْدِهَانٌ: see دَهْدَهَةٌ.<br>\
