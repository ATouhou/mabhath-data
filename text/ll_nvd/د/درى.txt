دَرَى الشَّىْءَ He knew the thing; syn. عَلِمَهُ;<br>\
(M;) [and so دَرَى بِالشَّىْءِ; for] you say, دَرَيْتُهُ<br>\
(S, Msb, K) and دَرَيْتُ بِهِ, (S, K,) aor. أَدْرِى, (Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. دَرْىٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and دِرْىٌ (Lh,<br>\
M, K) and دِرْيَةٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and دَرْيَةٌ, (M, *<br>\
K,) which last is said by Sb to be not used as an<br>\
inf. n. of un., but as denoting a state, or condition, (M,) and, accord. to some copies of the<br>\
S, دُرْيَةٌ, (TA, [so in one of my copies of the S,])<br>\
and دِرَايَةٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and دَرَيَانٌ and دِرْيَانٌ<br>\
(M, K) and دُرِىٌّ, (TS, K,) I knew it; (S, Msb,<br>\
K;) syn. عَلِمْتُهُ (Msb, K) or عَلِمْتُ بِهِ: (S:) or<br>\
it has a more special meaning than عَلِمْتُهُ: it is<br>\
said to signify I knew it after doubting: so says<br>\
Aboo-&#39;Alee: (TA:) or I knew it by a sort of<br>\
artifice, or cunning, or skill; (K, TA;) or with<br>\
painstaking, and artifice or cunning or skill;<br>\
(Har p. 24;) and therefore دَرَى is not said of<br>\
God: (TA:) a rájiz says, (S, * TA,) but this is<br>\
an instance of the rude speech of the Arabs of<br>\
the desert, (TA,)<br>\
↓ لَا هُمَّ لَا أَدْرِى وَأَنْتَ الدَّارِى<br>\
[O God, I know not, but Thou art the knowing]:<br>\
(S, TA: [in Har, p. 24, it is cited as commencing<br>\
with اَلّٰهُمَّ, and therefore as a prose-saying,<br>\
ascribed to Mohammad, and as adduced by some<br>\
to show that الدَّارِى is allowable as an epithet<br>\
applied to God:]) or, as some relate it, لَا أَدْرِ,<br>\
(S,) in which the ى is elided in consequence of<br>\
the frequent usage of the phrase; (S, M;) like<br>\
the phrases لَمْ أُبَلْ and لَمْ يَكُ; (S;) and like<br>\
لَا يَأْلُ in the saying أَقْبَلَ بِضَرْبَهٍ لَا يَأْلُ [q. v. in<br>\
art. الو]. (M.) [The saying لَا دَرَيْتُ وَلَا ائْتَليْتَ<br>\
or أَلَيْتَ &amp;c. is explained in the latter part of<br>\
the first paragraph of art. الو.] One says,<br>\
مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ النَّاسِ هُوَ [I know not who of mankind<br>\
he is]. (The Lexicons passim.) And IAar mentions the saying مَا تَدْرِى مَا دِرْيْتُهَا, (M,) or دُرَيْتُهَا,<br>\
(TA,) as meaning Thou knowest not (مَا تَعْلَمُ<br>\
[which may also be rendered she knows not])<br>\
what is her knowledge. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  دَرَى, (T,<br>\
M, K,) aor. يَدْرِى, (T, S,) inf. n. دَرْىٌ, (T, M, K,)<br>\
He deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or<br>\
outwitted, (ISk, T, S, M, K,) a man, (ISk, T,)<br>\
and an object of the chase; as also ↓ اِدَّرَى and<br>\
↓ تدرّى: (T, S, M, K: [ادْراهُ in the CK is a<br>\
mistake for ادّراهُ:]) he hid, or concealed, himself,<br>\
and deceived, deluded, &amp;c. (S.) A rájiz says,<br>\
↓ كَيْفَ تَرَانِىأَذَّرِى وَأَدَّرِى<br>\
غِرَرِى ↓ غِرَّاتِ جُمْلٍ وَتَدَرَّى<br>\
(T, S, M) i. e. How seest thou me winnowing the<br>\
dust of the mine and deceiving Juml by looking<br>\
at her while she is inadvertent, (T, S,) she also<br>\
deceiving me [by looking at me while I am inadvertent]: تَدَرَّى being for تَتَدَرَّى. (S.) See<br>\
also 3.<br>\
-A3-  دَرَى رَأْسَهُ, (K,) aor. يَدْرِى, inf. n. دَرْىٌ,<br>\
(TA,) He scratched his head with the مِدْرَى:<br>\
(K:) or رَأْسَهُ ↓ درّى he combed his head with the<br>\
مِدْرَى: (M: [see Ham p. 159, line 11: and see<br>\
also ذَرَّىَ:]) and ↓ تَدَرَّتْ she (a woman, S) loosed<br>\
and let down, or loosed and separated, or combed,<br>\
her hair (S, K, TA) with the مِدْرَاة. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
دَرَّىَ see above, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  دَرَّيْتُ تُرَابَ<br>\
المَعْدِنِ, inf. n. تَدْرِيَةٌ, [I winnowed the dust of the<br>\
mine to separate its gold: a dial. var. of ذَرَّيْتُ:<br>\
or perhaps a mistake for the latter.] (Msb.)<br>\
3<br>\
داراهُ, (T, M, Msb,) inf. n. مُدَارَاةٌ, (T, S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) He treated him with gentleness, or<br>\
blandishment; soothed, coaxed, wheedled, or cajoled, him: (S, * M, Msb:) or deceived, deluded,<br>\
beguiled, circumvented, or outwitted, him; or<br>\
strove, endeavoured, or desired, to do so: (T,<br>\
Mgh:) مُدَارَاةُ النَّاسِ and مُدَارَأَةُ النَّاسِ both signify المُدَاجَاةُ and المُلَايَنَةُ: (S in the present<br>\
art.:) and دَارَأْتُهُ and دَارَيْتُهُ both signify I was<br>\
fearful, or cautious, of him; and treated him<br>\
with gentleness or blandishment, or soothed him,<br>\
coaxed him, wheedled him, or cajoled him: (S in<br>\
art. درأ:) or دَارَأْتُهُ means “ I was fearful, or<br>\
cautious, of him,” as says AZ; or “ of his evil,<br>\
or mischief: ” and دَارَيْتُ signifies I deceived,<br>\
deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or outwitted; as<br>\
also ↓ دَرَيْتُ: (T in art. درأ:) and مُدَارَاةٌ also signifies [the acting with] good nature or disposition; and the holding familiar intercourse with<br>\
others. (T in the present art.) You say also,<br>\
داراهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ, and عَلَيْهِ, He endeavoured to turn<br>\
him, or entice him, by blandishment, or by deceitful arts, from the thing, and to it; syn. رَاوَدَهُ.<br>\
(L in art. رود.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And دارى عَنْهُ He defended<br>\
him; or spoke, or pleaded, or contended, in<br>\
defence of him; like رَاجَمَ عَنْهُ. (TA in art. رجم.)<br>\
4<br>\
ادارهُ بِهِ He made him to know, or have<br>\
knowledge of, it; acquainted him with it. (S,<br>\
M, Msb, K.) The reading وَلَا أَدْرَأَكُمْ بِهِ, with ء,<br>\
[in the Kur x. 17,] is incorrect: the proper<br>\
reading is without ء. (S, M.)<br>\
-A2-  ادرى دَرِيَّةً, and<br>\
↓ تدرّى, (M, TA,) He took for himself, or prepared, a دريّة. (TA.) [See also تَدَرَّأَ.]<br>\
5<br>\
تَدَرَّىَ see 1, latter part, in two places,<br>\
-A2-  and also<br>\

-A4-  جَيْشٌ<br>\
يَتَدَرَّى [as though for يَتَدَرَّأُ] An army of which<br>\
one part presses upon another; like يَتَجَعْبَى.<br>\
(TA in art. جعب.)<br>\
7<br>\
اِنْدَرَى for اِنْدَرَأَ is vulgar. (TA in art. درأ.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِدْتَرَىَ see 1, latter part, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  اِدَّرَوْ مَكَانًا<br>\
means They directed their course to, or towards,<br>\
a place, making an inroad, or incursion, upon an<br>\
enemy, and going to fight and plunder: (M,<br>\
TA:) or as though they did so. (S.)<br>\
دُرْيَةٌ, accord. to some copies of the S, is an<br>\
inf. n. of دَرَيْتُهُ meaning عَلِمْتُهُ, like دِرْيَةٌ &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  أَتَى هٰذَا الأَمْرُ مِنْ غَيْرِ دُرْيَةٍ means This thing,<br>\
or event, came without any act, or deed. (T,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
دَرِيَّةٌ, without ء, A beast, (As, T, S,) or a camel,<br>\
(ISk, T,) or a she-camel, or a cow, (M,) by<br>\
means of which one conceals himself from the<br>\
objects of the chase, or wild animals, (As, ISk,<br>\
T, S, M,) so deceiving them, (ISk, T, M,) shooting,<br>\
or casting, when he is able to do so: (As, ISk,<br>\
T, S:) or, accord. to AZ, it is with ء, [دَرِيْئَةٌ,]<br>\
because the دريئة is driven (تُدْرَأُ, i. e. تُدْفَعُ,)<br>\
towards the objects of the chase. (S, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also A wild animal, or wild animals, (وَحْش,)<br>\

p. 75,) by aiming at which one learns to pierce<br>\
or thrust [with the spear]. (Ham, K.) So in a<br>\
verse cited voce دَرِيْئَةٌ, in art. درأ. (Ham ubi<br>\
suprà.)<br>\

مِدْرًى and ↓ مِدْرَاةٌ (T, S, M, K) and ↓ مَدْرِيَةٌ,<br>\

kesr to the ر, (TA, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\

of a woman&#39;s hair; (S;) a thing with which the<br>\

explanation of the second:) and, (T, S,) as being<br>\
likened to the iron instrument thus called, (T,)<br>\
a horn (T, S, M, K) of a [wild] bull [and of a<br>\
gazelle], (T, S,) with which the female hairdresser sometimes adjusts, or puts in order, the<br>\
locks of a woman&#39;s hair, (S,) or with which one<br>\
scratches his head: (K:) and, accord. to some<br>\
copies of the K, a comb: (TA:) the pl. is مَدَارٍ<br>\
and مَدَارَى, (M, K, TA,) in the latter of which,<br>\
the alif [written ى] is a substitute for ى [properly so called]. (M, TA.) [Hence,] جَأْبٌ المِدْرَى,<br>\
or جَابُ المدرى (accord. to different copies of<br>\
the S, [or جَأْبَةُ المِدْرَى, or جَأْبَةُ المدرى, see arts.<br>\
