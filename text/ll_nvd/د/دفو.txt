دَفِىَ, [aor. يَدْفَى,] inf. n. دَفًا, He, or it, was,<br>\
or became, such as is termed أَدْفَى, in any of the<br>\
senses of this epithet. (M.) [See also 4.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
دَفَوْتُ الجَرِيحَ, (S, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
دَفَيْتُ,]) aor. أَدْفُوهُ, inf. n. دَفْوٌ; (S, TA;) and<br>\
↓ دَافَيْتُهُ and ↓ أَدْفَيْتُهُ; (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K;) I despatched the wounded man; i. e. hastened and<br>\
completed his slaughter; or made his slaughter<br>\
sure, or certain: (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K:) and so<br>\
دَافَأْتُهُ and أَدْفَأْتُهُ (TA) [and دَافَقْتُهُ &amp;c.: see 3 in<br>\
art. دف]. Accord. to Ibn-Abi-l-Hadeed, دَفَى,<br>\

[دَفَأَ,] signifies He slew, in the dial. of Kináneh.<br>\

-A2-  It is related in a trad. that a<br>\
captive was brought to the Prophet, (S, TA,)<br>\
shivering by reason of cold, (TA,) and he said to<br>\
some persons, اِذْهَبُوا بِهِ فَأَدْفُوهُ, meaning [Take ye<br>\
him away and] clothe him so as to protect him<br>\
from the cold; (S, TA;) for أَدْفِئُوهُ; because the<br>\
pronunciation of ء was not of the dial. of Kureysh;<br>\
but they thought that he meant slaughter; (TA;)<br>\
and they took him away and slew him: therefore<br>\
he paid the fine for his blood. (S, TA.) As is<br>\
said in the K, أَدْفَيْتُ is a dial. var. of أَدْفَأْتُ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  ادفى said of a gazelle, His horns were,<br>\

[denoting alternation of any kind]: (S, K:)<br>\

مُتَجَافِيًا [The camel went along with an inclining<br>\
from side to side]. (S.) [See also the second of<br>\
the verses cited in the first paragraph of art. دف:<br>\
from the explanation of which by ISd, it appears<br>\
that تَدَافَى is perhaps originally تَدَافَّ.]<br>\
