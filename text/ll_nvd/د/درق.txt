دَرَقَةٌ i. q. حَجَفَةٌ, (S, K, TA,) or تُرْسٌ, (Mgh,)<br>\
[i. e. A shield,] made without wood and without<br>\
sinews: (Mgh, TA:) or made of skins sewed one<br>\
over another: (ISd and TA voce حَجَفَةٌ, q. v.:)<br>\
pl. ↓ دَرَقٌ, (S, K,) [or rather this is a coll. gen. n.,]<br>\
and [the pl. is] أَدْرَاقٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and دِرَاقٌ;<br>\
(K;) this last mentioned by IDrd, who says,<br>\
they are made of the skins of beasts found in the<br>\
country of the Abyssinians, (TA,) [as are shields<br>\
thus called in the present day: they are made of<br>\
the skin of the hippopotamus, and of other pachydermatous animals; and sometimes of the skin<br>\
of the crocodile; generally oval, with a large<br>\
protuberance in the middle, behind which is the<br>\
handle, and between a foot and a half and two<br>\
feet in length.]<br>\
-A2-  Also A خَوْخَة [here meaning<br>\
sluice] in a rivulet: an arabicized word, from<br>\
[the Persian] دَرِيچَهْ. (K, TA.) This is what is<br>\
meant by the saying of the lawyers, that the repairing of the درقة is incumbent on the owner of<br>\
the rivulet. (TA.)<br>\
دِرَّاقٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
دِرْيَاقٌ (S, K) and دَرْيَاقٌ (El-Hejeree, K) and<br>\
↓ دِرْيَاقَةٌ and ↓ دَرْيَاقَةٌ (K) and ↓ دِرَّاقٌ, (Fr, TA,)<br>\
with kesr, like دِنَّارٌ &amp;c., not دَرَّاقٌ, as it would<br>\
seem to be from the manner in which it is mentioned in the K, (TA,) [and as it is written in the<br>\
CK and my MS. copy of the K,] i. q. تِرْيَاقٌ<br>\
[q. v.]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K,) or ↓ دِرْيَاقَةٌ, (TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  Wine; (K, TA;) as being likened to ترياق<br>\
[properly so called: a meaning also borne by<br>\
تِرْيَاقٌ and تِرْيَاقَةٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
دِرْيَاقَةٌ and دَرْيَاقَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in three places.<br>\
دَوْرَقٌ A certain measure for wine, or beverage,<br>\
(S, A, O, L,) containing the quantity to be drunk<br>\
[at once]: a Persian word, [originally دَوْرَهْ or<br>\
دُورَهْ,] arabicized: (L, TA:) [J says,] I think it<br>\
to be Persian, arabicized: (S:) it is thus correctly written; not, as the context of the K requires it to be in this sense, دَرْدَقٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also A jar having a loop-shaped handle, (K,<br>\
TA,) that is lifted, or carried, by the hand: of<br>\
the dial. of the people of Mekkeh: pl. دَوَارِقُ.<br>\
(TA.) [In Egypt, it is applied to A narrownecked drinking-bottle, made of a dust-coloured,<br>\
or grayish, porous earth, for the purpose of cooling the water by evaporation: several varieties<br>\
of this kind of bottle are figured in ch. v. of my<br>\
“ Modern Egyptians. ”]<br>\
