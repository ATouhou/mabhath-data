i. q. قَطِرَانٌ and زِفْتٌ [both app. here meaning<br>\
Tar, or liquid pitch]: (K:) or such as is thick:<br>\
mentioned in this art. by IF, and also as written<br>\
with ذ. (TA.)<br>\
دِفْلَى, (T, S, M, K, &amp;c.,) accord. to those who<br>\
make the alif to be a sign of the fem. gender;<br>\
and دِفْلًى, accord. to those who make that letter to<br>\
be one of quasi-coordination; used alike as a sing.<br>\
and a pl.; (S;) and ↓ دِفْلٌ; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K;)<br>\
[the first of these appellations applied in the present<br>\
day to The rose-bay, or laurel-bay; oleander,<br>\
nerium oleander, rhododendron, or rhododaphne:<br>\
and also to the common laurel:] a certain tree,<br>\
(T, M,) or plant, (S, K,) bitter, (T, S, M, K,)<br>\
very bitter, (TA,) and poisonous, (T,) green, and<br>\
beautiful in appearance, the blossom of which is<br>\
beautifully tinged, (M,) called in Persian خَرْزَهْرَهْ:<br>\
(K:) there is a river-kind, and a land-kind:<br>\
the leaves are like those of the حَمْقَآء [or gardenpurslane], but more slender; and the branches,<br>\
or twigs, are long, spreading over the ground;<br>\
at the leaves are thorns; and it grows in waste<br>\
places: the river-kind grows upon the banks<br>\
of rivers; its thorns are unconspicuous, or unapparent; its leaves are like those of the خِلَاف<br>\
[or salix Aegyptia] and of the almond, broad;<br>\
and the upper part of its stem is thicker than the<br>\
lower part thereof: (TA:) it is very deadly:<br>\
its blossom is like the red rose, (K,) very rough<br>\
(خشن جدّا [but this I think is a mistranscription<br>\
for حَسَنٌ جِدًّا very beautiful], and upon it is a<br>\
kind of tuft like hair: (TA:) its fruit is like<br>\
the خُرْنُوب [q. v.]; (K;) having an aperient,<br>\
or a deobstruent, property; and stuffed with a<br>\
substance like wool: (TA:) it is good for the<br>\
mange, or scab, and the itch (حِكَّة), used in the<br>\
manner of a liniment, (K,) and especially the<br>\
expressed juice of its leaves; (TA;) and for<br>\
pain of the knee and the back, (K,) of long<br>\
duration, (TA,) applied in the manner of a<br>\
poultice, or plaster; and for expelling fleas and<br>\
the [insect called] أَرَض, by the sprinkling of a<br>\
decoction thereof; and the rubbing over with<br>\
the heart thereof twelve times, after cleansing,<br>\
is good for removing the [malignant leprosy<br>\
termed] بَرَص; (K;) and its leaves put upon<br>\
hard tumours are very beneficial: but it is a<br>\
poison: [yet] sometimes it is mixed with wine<br>\
and rue, and given to be drunk, and saves from<br>\
the poisons of venomous reptiles: the Ra-ees<br>\
[Ibn-Seenà, or Avicenna,] says that it is perilous<br>\
by itself, and its blossom, to men, and to horses<br>\
and the like, and to dogs, but is beneficial when<br>\
made into a decoction with rue, and drunk:<br>\
(TA:) IAar says that the [trees termed] آء and<br>\
أَلَآء and حبر [app. a mistranscription for خَبْر, a<br>\
species of lote-tree,] are all called دِفْلَى. (T.)<br>\
AHn says that the زَنْد made from the دِفْلَى is<br>\
excellent for producing fire: and hence the prov.,<br>\
اِقْدَحْ بِدِفْلَى فِى مَرْخِ ثُمَّ شُدَّ بَعْدُ أَوْ أَرْخِ [Endeavour thou to produce fire with wood of the دفلى<br>\
upon wood of the مرخ: then tighten afterwards<br>\
or loosen]: (M:) said when one incites a bad<br>\
man against another bad man: (M, Meyd:) or,<br>\
accord. to IAar, said in relation to a man whom<br>\
one needs not to press, or importune. (Meyd.)<br>\
