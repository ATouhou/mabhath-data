behind his back; he followed his back; (M, TA;)<br>\
he followed him, with respect to place, and also<br>\
with respect to time, and also (assumed tropical:)  with respect to<br>\

He came following them. (M, TA.) And دَبَرَنِى<br>\
فُلَانٌ Such a one came after me, behind me, (T,<br>\
A,) or following me nearly. (A.) And دَبَرَهُ, inf.<br>\
n. دَبْرٌ, He succeeded him, and remained after him.<br>\
(TA.) And قَبَحَ اللّٰهُ مَا قَبَلَ مِنْهُ وَ مَا دَبَرَ [May<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  See also 4, in four places. ―<br>\
-b3-  دَبَرَ said of an<br>\

دَبُخَ, (M, TA,) inf. n. دَبَارٌ,<br>\

like دَمَارَةٌ (q. v.), and app. ↓ دَبَرَى, (see الخَيْبَرَى,)<br>\
or دَبرَى may be a simple subst.,] The people, or<br>\
company of men, perished; (As, * S, * M, K *<br>\
TA;) went away, turning the back, and did not<br>\
return. (TA. [And ادبر (q. v.) has a similar, or<br>\
the same, meaning.]) Hence, عَلَيْهِ الدَّبَارُ Perdition<br>\
befall him; may he go away, turning the back,<br>\
and not return. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And دَبَرَ (tropical:)  He became an old man. (S, A, K.) Hence, as some<br>\
say, the expression in the Kur [lxxiv. 36], وَاللَّيْلُ<br>\

K.) [Hence,] دَبَرَتْ لَهُ الرِّيحُ بَعْدَ مَا أَقْبَلَتْ [lit.<br>\
The wind became west to him after it had been<br>\
east: meaning (tropical:)  his fortune became evil after it<br>\
had been good]: and دَبَرَ بَعْدَ إِقْبَالٍ [(tropical:)  which means<br>\
the same: see دَبُورٌ; and see also 4 in this art., and<br>\
in art. قبل]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And دُبِرَ, (S, K,) a verb of<br>\
which the agent is not named, (S,) He, (K,) a man,<br>\
(TA,) or it, a people, (S, M,) was smitten, or<br>\
affected, by the wind called الدَّبُور. (S, M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  دَبَرَ الحَدِيثَ عَنْهُ: see 2.<br>\
-A3-  قَبَلْتُ الحَبْلَ وَدَبَرْتُهُ:<br>\
see دَبِيرٌ.<br>\
-A4-  دَبَرَ, aor.<br>\
دَبُخَ, inf. n. دَبْرٌ, signifies, accord.<br>\
to Kr, He wrote a writing or letter or book: but<br>\

(M.) [The inf. n. is explained in the K as syn.<br>\
with اِكْتِتَابٌ.]<br>\
-A5-  دَبِرَ, (S, M, Mgh, K,) aor.<br>\
دَبَخَ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. دَبَرٌ, (M, Mgh,) He (a horse or the<br>\
like, M, K, and a camel, S, M, Mgh) had galls,<br>\
or sores, on his back, (M, Mgh, K, * TA,) produced by the saddle and the like; (Mgh;) as also<br>\
↓ ادبر. (K. [But the corresponding passage in the<br>\
M shows that this is probably a mistake for أَدْبَرُ<br>\
a syn. of دَبِرٌ.])<br>\
2<br>\
دبّر الأَمْرَ, (T, M, A,) or فِى الأَمْرِ (S,) inf. n.<br>\
تَدْبِيرٌ, (T, S, K,) He considered, or forecast, the<br>\
issues, or results, of the affair, or event, or case;<br>\
(TA;) and so ↓ تدبّرهُ: (Mgh:) or its end, issue,<br>\
or result; (T, M, K;) as also ↓ تدبّرهُ: (T, M,<br>\
Msb, K:) or he looked to what would, or might,<br>\
be its result: and فِيهِ ↓ تدبّر he thought, or meditated, upon it; (S;) [as also ↓ تدبّرهُ:] Aktham<br>\
Ibn-Seyfee said to his sons, أَعْجَازَ ↓ يَابَنِىَّ لَا تَتَدَبَّرُوا<br>\
أُمُورٍ قَدْ وَلَّتْ صُدُورُهَا [O my sons, think not upon<br>\
the ends of things whereof the beginnings have<br>\
passed]: (T: [see عَجُزٌ:]) and in the Kur [iv.<br>\
84] it is said, القُرْآنَ ↓ أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ Will they,<br>\
then, not consider the meanings of the Kur-án,<br>\
and endeavour to obtain a clear knowledge of<br>\
what is in it? (Bd:) and again, in the Kur<br>\
[xxiii. 70], القَوْلَ ↓ أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُوا Have they, then,<br>\
not thought upon, (TA,) and endeavoured to understand, (يَتَفَهَّمُوا, K,) what has been said to them<br>\
in the Kur-án? for ↓ تَدَبُّرٌ signifies the thinking,<br>\
or meditating, upon [a thing], and endeavouring<br>\
to understand [it]; syn. تَفَكُّرٌ and تَفَهُّمٌ: (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ تدبّرهُ he looked into it, considered it, examined it, or studied it, repeatedly, in order to<br>\
know it, or until he knew it. (Msb in art. امل.)<br>\
دبّر أَمْرًا, inf. n. as above, signifies [also] He did,<br>\
performed, or executed, a thing, or an affair,<br>\
with thought, or consideration. (Msb.) [And<br>\
He devised, planned, or plotted, a thing, عَلَى غَيْرِهِ<br>\
against another. And hence, He managed, conducted, ordered, or regulated, an affair; because<br>\
the doing so requires consideration of the issues,<br>\
or results, of the affair. You say, دبّر أُمُورَ البِلَادِ,<br>\
and, elliptically, دبّر البِلَادَ, He managed, conducted, ordered, or regulated, the affairs of the<br>\
provinces, or country: and in like manner, the<br>\
affairs of a house. تَدْبِيرٌ is also attributed to irrational animals; as, for ex., to horses; meaning<br>\
their conducting the affair of victory: and to inanimate things; as, for ex., to stars; meaning<br>\
their regulating the alternations of seasons &amp;c.: see<br>\
Bd in lxxix. 5. And دبّر alone signifies He acted<br>\
with consideration of the issues, or results, of<br>\
affairs, or events, or cases; acted with, or exercised, forecast, or forethought; or acted with<br>\
policy.] ―<br>\

free after his own death, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
saying to him, Thou art free after my death:<br>\

to depend upon his own death. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  دبّر<br>\
الحَدِيثَ, (inf. n. as above, K,) He related the<br>\
tradition, narrative, or story, having received it,<br>\
or heard it, from another person: (As, T, S, K: *)<br>\
and هُوَ يُدَبِّرُ حَدِيثَ فُلَانٍ He relates the tradition, &amp;c., of, or received from, or heard from,<br>\
such a one: (As, S:) and دبّر الحَدِيثَ عَنْهُ; (M;)<br>\
or عَنْهُ ↓ دَبَرَهُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
دَبُخَ; (TA;) He related<br>\
the tradition, &amp;c., having received it, or heard it,<br>\
from him, (S, M, K,) after his death: (S, K:)<br>\
Sh says that دبّر الحَدِيثَ is unknown; but so the<br>\
phrase is related on the authority of A&#39;Obeyd:<br>\
Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà [i. e. Th] disallows يُدَبِّرُهُ as<br>\
meaning he relates it; and says that it is يَذْبُرُهُ,<br>\
with ذ, meaning “he knows it, or learns it, well,<br>\
soundly, or thoroughly;” syn. يُتْقِنُهُ. (T.)<br>\
3<br>\
دابرهُ, (S, A, *) inf. n. مُدَابَرَةٌ and دِبَارٌ, (K,)<br>\
[He turned his back upon him: see 6. ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He severed himself from him, and<br>\
avoided him, or shunned him; (TA;) became<br>\
at variance with him; (A;) regarded him, or<br>\
treated him, with enmity, or hostility. (S, A, K.)<br>\
And دابر رَحِمَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He cut, or severed, the ties, or<br>\
bonds, of his relationship; disunited himself from<br>\
his relations. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  دَابَرْتُهَا I made a slit such<br>\
as is termed إِدْبَارَة in her (a ewe&#39;s or goat&#39;s or<br>\
camel&#39;s) ear. (As, S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 4.<br>\
4<br>\
ادبر, (M, K, and Bd in ix. 25,) inf. n. إِدْبَارٌ<br>\
(S, M) and ↓ دُبْرٌ, accord. to Kr, but correctly the<br>\
latter is a simple subst. [or quasi-inf. n.]; (M;)<br>\
and ↓ دَبَرَ, (IAar, S, K,) inf. n. دَبْرٌ (TA) and دُبُورٌ;<br>\
(TK;) He went, turning his back; turned back;<br>\
went back; took a backward course; retreated;<br>\
retired; retrograded; declined; syn. وَلَّىِ (S, M,<br>\
K) and تَأَخَّرَ (IAar) and ذَهَبَ إِلَى خَلْفٍ; (Bd<br>\
ubi suprà, and S and K in art. قبل;) contr. of<br>\
أَقْبَلَ. (S, Bd.) And ادبر بِهِ [He went back, or<br>\
backward, with it, or him; removed, or turned,<br>\
it, or him, backward]. (S, K.) You say, يُدْبِرُ<br>\
بِالدَّلْوِ إِلَى الحَوْضِ [He goes back with the bucket<br>\
to the watering-trough]: opposed to the phrase<br>\
يُقْبِلُ بِهَا إِلَى بِئْرِ. (A.) See also دَبِيرٌ, first sentence. And ادبر عَنْهُ [He went back, &amp;c., from<br>\
it, or him]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  He feigned<br>\
himself negligent of, or inattentive to, the want of<br>\
his friend; (K;) as though he turned back from<br>\
him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] ادبر signifies (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
went backward, to a bad state; said of the affair,<br>\
or case, of a people. (M, TA.) You say also,<br>\
أَمْرٌ فُلَانٍ إِلَى إِقْبَالٍ and [in the contr. sense] الى<br>\
إِدْبَارٌ (assumed tropical:)  [The affair, or case, of such a one is inclining to advance, and to go backward, to a bad<br>\
state]. (A.) [إِدْبَارٌ often signifies The retiring,<br>\
or declining, of good fortune; opposed to إِقْبَالٌ:<br>\
see also 1, in the latter part of the paragraph.]<br>\
And ادبر القَوْمُ (assumed tropical:)  The case of the people took a<br>\
backward course, and there remained none of them.<br>\
(TA.) And ادبر النَّهَارِ and ↓ دَبَرَ (inf. n. of the latter<br>\
دُبُورٌ, A) signify the same; (Fr, T, S, M;) i. e. The<br>\
day went, or departed; (M, A;) and so الصَّيْفُ<br>\
[the summer, or the spring]: and in like manner<br>\
one says [in the contr. sense] أَقْبَلَ and قَبَلَ: so<br>\
says Fr, and he adds, but you say of a man,<br>\
اقبل الرَّاكِبُ and ادبر only, with ا, though [Az<br>\
says] it seems to me that the two forms are applicable in the same manner to men as they are to<br>\
times. (T.) Some read, in the Kur [lxxiv. 36],<br>\
↓ وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا دَبَرَ, (T, S,) which, accord. to some,<br>\
means And the night when it cometh after the<br>\
day; (T;) or when it followeth the day: (S:<br>\
[for another rendering, see 1:]) others, (T, S,)<br>\
the greater number, (T,) read اذا أَدْبَرَ, (T, S,)<br>\
meaning when it retreateth to depart. (T.)<br>\
[Hence,] ادبرت الصَّلَاةُ (assumed tropical:)  The prayer ended. (Bd<br>\
in l. 39.) And وَإِدْبَارَ السُّجُودِ: and وَإِدْبَارَ النُّجُومِ:<br>\
see دُبُرٌ. And ادبر (assumed tropical:)  He died; (K;) as also ↓ دابر.<br>\
(Lh, M, K. [See also دَبَرَ القَوْمُ, in the first paragraph.]) ―<br>\

↓ مِنْهُ وَمَا دَبَرَ signify the same [i. e. What is in<br>\
front, of the mountain; and what is behind].<br>\
(JK.)<br>\
-A2-  ادبر also signifies He made a man to<br>\
be behind him. (M.)<br>\
-A3-  And It, (the saddle,<br>\
S, K, or a burden, M, TA,) and he, (a man, S,<br>\
Mgh,) caused a camel, (S, M, Mgh,) or a horse<br>\
or the like, (K,) to have galls, or sores, on the<br>\
back; galled the back. (M, Mgh, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
His camel became galled in the back. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
See also 1, last signification.<br>\
-A4-  It is also said [app.,<br>\
of a man, as meaning He slit the ear of a she-camel<br>\
in a particular manner, i. e.,] when (T) the فَتْلَة<br>\
[or twisted slip formed by slitting (see إِدْبَارَةٌ)] of<br>\
the ear of a she-camel, (T, K,) it being slit, (T,<br>\
[but for اذا نحرت in the TT and TA, from which<br>\
this is taken, I read إِذَا بُحِرَتْ, an emendation evidently required,]) turns towards the back of the<br>\
neck: (IAar, T, TT, K, * TA:) and أَقْبَلَ is said<br>\
in like manner when this فتلة is turned towards<br>\
the face. (IAar, T, TT, TA. [See also 3.])<br>\
-A5-  It<br>\
signifies also عَرَفَ دَبِيرَهُ مِنْ قَبِيلِهِ, (IAar,) or عَرَفَ<br>\
قَبِيلَهُ مِنْ دَبِيرِهِ; (K;) said of a man. (IAar.<br>\
[See دَبِيرٌ.])<br>\
-A6-  Also He, (K,) a man, (TA,) or it,<br>\
a company of men, (S, M,) entered upon [a time<br>\
in which blew] the wind called الدَّبُور. (S, M,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A7-  And He journeyed on the day called دُبَار,<br>\
i. e. Wednesday. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A8-  And He became<br>\
possessed of much property or wealth, or of many<br>\
camels or the like. (Msb, * K.)<br>\

-b2-  عَرَفَ الأَمْرَ تَدَبُّرًا<br>\
means He knew the thing at the last, (M, Mgh,)<br>\
after it had past. (Mgh.) Jereer says, (M,)<br>\
وَلَا تَتَّقُونَ الشَّرَّ حَتَّىيُصِيبَكُمْ<br>\
وَلَا تَعْرِفُونَ الأَمْرَ إِلَّا تَدَبُّرَا<br>\
[And ye fear not evil until it befalleth you, and<br>\
ye know not the thing save at the last, when it<br>\
has past]. (M, Mgh. *) [See also 10.] And in<br>\
like manner, تَدَبَّرَ الكَلَامَ [meaning He postponed<br>\
the saying] is said of one who has sworn after<br>\
doing a thing. (Mgh.)<br>\
6<br>\
تدابروا They turned their backs, one upon<br>\
another. (A&#39;Obeyd, T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\

one another; (A&#39;Obeyd, T;) became at variance,<br>\

also,] He came behind him. (TA.) You say,<br>\

cast, or shot, at him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [As such also,<br>\
He saw it behind him: he looked back to it: he<br>\

or knew, (TA,) at the end of it, namely, an<br>\
affair, or a case, what he did not see, (M, K,) or<br>\
know, (TA,) at the beginning of it: (M, K:)<br>\
[or rather] he knew it at the end of an affair, or a<br>\
case; namely, a thing that he did not know at<br>\
the beginning of it. (T, A.) You say, اِسْتَدْبَرَ<br>\
مِنْ أَمْرِهِ مَالَمْ يَسْتَقْبِلْ He knew at the end of his<br>\
affair, or case, what he did not know at the<br>\
beginning of it. (A.) And إِنَّ فُلَانًا لَوِ اسْتَقْبَلَ مِنْ<br>\

one, had he known at the beginning of his affair,<br>\

affair. (T.) [See also 5.] ―<br>\
-b4-  استدبرهُ عَلَى غَيْرِهِ<br>\
He appropriated it to himself exclusively, in preference to others: (AO, K:) because he who<br>\

thing. (K. [In the CK, for خَلْف is put خَلَف.])<br>\
Hence the saying, (TA,) جَعَلْتُ كَلَامَهُ دَبْرَ أُذُنِى<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I turned away from his speech, and feigned<br>\

un.] are ↓ دَبْرَةٌ and ↓ دِبَارَةٌ; which signify A<br>\
مَشَارَة [explained in the TA as meaning a channel<br>\
of water; but it seems to be here used as meaning a portion of ground separated from the<br>\
adjacent parts, for sowing or planting, being surrounded by dams, or by ridges of earth, which<br>\
retain the water for irrigation, as explained in<br>\
art. شور, and as is indicated by its Persian equivalent here following,] in, (S,) or of, (K,) land<br>\
that is sown or for sowing; (S, K;) called in<br>\
Persian كُرْد: (S:) and دِبَارٌ signifies small<br>\
channels for irrigation between tracts of seedproduce; (K;) and its sing. is دَبْرَةٌ: (TA:)<br>\
[Mtr says,] دَبْرَةٌ is syn. with مَشَارَةٌ; in Persian<br>\
كَرْدَه [app. a mistranscription for كُرْد as above];<br>\
and the pl. is دَبْرٌ and دِبَارٌ: (Mgh:) [ISd says,]<br>\
دَبْرَةٌ signifies a small channel for irrigation<br>\
between tracts of land sown or for sowing: or,<br>\
as some say, i. q. مَشَارَةٌ: and the pl. is دِبَارٌ: it is<br>\
also said that دِبَارٌ signifies i. q. كُرْدَةٌ; and its<br>\
n. un. is دِبَارَةٌ: and دِبَارَاتٌ signifies rivulets that<br>\
flow through land of seed-produce; and its sing.<br>\
is دَبْرَةٌ: but I know not how this is, unless دَبْرَةٌ<br>\
have دِبَارٌ for its pl., and this have ة added to it,<br>\
as in فِحَالَةٌ, and so دبارات be a pl. pl., i. e. perfect<br>\
pl. of دِبَارَةٌ: AHn says that دَبْرَةٌ signifies a patch<br>\
of ground that is sown; [as is also said in the<br>\
K;] and the pl. is دِبَارٌ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A piece<br>\

-b3-  And A mountain; (T, K;) in the<br>\
Abyssinian language: (TA: [Az says, “I<br>\

مِنَ المُسْلِمِينَ [I would not that I had a mountain of gold and that I had harmed a man of<br>\
the Muslims]: (T, K:) but [SM says that] this<br>\
is a confounding of two readings; which are,<br>\
دَبْرًا مِنْ ذَهَبٍ and أَنْ يَكُونَ دَبْرٌ لِى ذَهَبًا: (TA:)<br>\
another reading is ذَبْرًا مِنْ ذَهَبٍ. (TA in art.<br>\
ذبر.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also دِبْرٌ. ―<br>\
-b5-  Also, (S, M, K, &amp;c.,)<br>\
and ↓ دِبْرٌ, (AHn, M, K,) A swarm of bees: and<br>\
hornets, or large wasps; syn. زَنَابِيرُ: (S, M, K:)<br>\
and the like thereof, having stings in their hinder<br>\
parts: (B:) it has no sing., or n. un.: (As, M:)<br>\
or the n. un. is ↓ دَبْرَةٌ or ↓ دِبْرَةٌ; of which the<br>\
dim. ↓ دُبَيْرَةٌ occurs in a trad.: (TA:) pl. [of<br>\
pauc.] أَدْبُرٌ (K) and [of mult.] دُبُورٌ: (As, S, K:)<br>\
and ↓ دَبُورٌ, with fet-h to the first letter, signifies<br>\
bees; and has no proper sing. (M.) &#39;Ásim Ibn-Thábit El-Ansáree was called حَمِىُّ الدَّبْرِ [The<br>\
protected of hornets, or bees], because his corpse<br>\
was protected from his enemies by large hornets,<br>\
(S,) or by a swarm of bees. (M, Mgh * in art.<br>\
حمى.) ―<br>\
-b6-  دَبْرٌ also signifies The young ones of<br>\
locusts; (AHn, K;) and so ↓ دِبْرٌ. (AHn, M, K.)<br>\
دُبْرٌ: see دُبُرٌ: and دَبَرِىٌّ; the latter in two<br>\
places.<br>\
-A2-  See also 4, first sentence.<br>\
دِبْرٌ: see دَبْرٌ, last sentence but two, and last<br>\
sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S, M, K,) and ↓ دَبْرٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
Much property or wealth; or many camels or<br>\
the like; (S, M, K;) such as cannot be computed, or calculated: (M:) the sing. [and dual]<br>\
and pl. are alike: you say [using it as an epithet]<br>\
مَالٌ دِبْرٌ and مَالَانِ دِبْرٌ and أَمْوَالٌ دِبْرٌ: (S, M:)<br>\
this mode of usage is best known; but sometimes دُبُورٌ is used as its pl.: (M:) in like manner you say مَالٌ دَثْرٌ: and you say also رَجُلٌ ذُو<br>\
دِبْرٍ, (S, TA,) and رجل دبر, [unless this be a mistake for the phrase immediately preceding,] (Fr,<br>\
TA,) meaning a man having large possessions in<br>\
land or houses or other property. (Fr, S, TA.)<br>\
دَبَرٌ [app. signifies A tract of the western sky<br>\
at sunset: for] the Arabs said, إِذَا رَأَيْتَ الثُّرَيَّا<br>\
بِدَبَرْ فَشَهْرٌ نِتَاجْ وَشَهْرٌ مَطَرْ وَإِذَا رَأَيْتَ الشِّعْرَى بِقَبَلْ<br>\
فَمَجْدُ فَتًى وَحِمْلُ جَمَلْ, meaning When thou<br>\
seest the Pleiades near to setting with sunset,<br>\
then [is a month which] is a time of breeding of<br>\
camels, and [a month which is] a time of rain:<br>\
and when thou seest Sirius [near to rising] with<br>\
sunset, [then is the glory of the generous man,<br>\
and the time for the burden of the full-grown hecamel; for] then is the most intense degree of<br>\
cold, when none but the generous and noble and<br>\
ingenuous man will patiently persevere in the<br>\
exercise of hospitality and beneficence, and when<br>\
the heavy burden is not laid save upon the strong<br>\
full-grown he-camel, because then the camels<br>\
become lean and the pasturage is scanty. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, and so is أَدْبَارٌ, a pl. [or rather the former is a coll. gen. n.] of ↓ دَبَرَةٌ, (S, M, K,) which<br>\
signifies A gall, or sore, on the back (M, * Mgh,<br>\
K, * TA) of a horse or the like (M, K, TA) and<br>\
of a camel, (M, Mgh,) produced by the saddle<br>\
and the like; (Mgh;) and also on the كِرْكِرَة<br>\
[or callous projection on the breast] of a camel.<br>\
(S and K in art. سر.) They used to say, in the<br>\
Time of Ignorance, إِذَا بَرَأَ الدَّبَرُ وَعَفَا الأَثَرُ, explained as meaning [When] the galls on the back<br>\
of the beast or upon the foot of the camel [shall<br>\
heal, and the footstep, or mark, become obliterated]. (TA from a trad.)<br>\
-A3-  Also inf. n. of<br>\
دَبِرَ. (M, Mgh.)<br>\
دَبِرٌ (M, K) and ↓ أَدْبَرُ (M) A horse or the like,<br>\
(M, K,) and a camel, (M,) having galls, or sores,<br>\
(M, K,) on his back (TA) [produced by the saddle<br>\
and the like; having his back galled: see دَبَرٌ]:<br>\
fem. [of the former] دَبِرَةٌ and [of the latter]<br>\
↓ دَبْرَآءُ: and pl. [of either] دَبْرَى. (M, TA.)<br>\
[Hence the prov.,] هَانَ عَلَى الأَمْلَسِ مَا لَاقَى الدَّبِرُ<br>\
[What he that had galls on his back experienced<br>\
was a light matter to him that had a sound<br>\
back]: applied to one who has an ill concern<br>\
for his companion. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In the phrase رَجُلٌ<br>\
خَسِرٌ وَدَبِرٌ [app. meaning A man erring and<br>\
perishing], Lh says that دَبِرٌ is an imitative sequent to خَسِرٌ: but [ISd says,] I think that خَسِرٌ<br>\
is a verbal epithet, and that دَبِرٌ is a possessive<br>\
epithet. (M in art. دمر.) You say also أَحْمَقٌ<br>\
دَامِرٌ ↓ خَاسِرٌ دَابِرٌ: (T in art. بت: [see art. خسر:])<br>\
and دَابِرٌ is said to be an imitative sequent to<br>\
خَاسِرٌ. (TA.)<br>\
دُبُرٌ and ↓ دُبْرٌ, (the latter a contraction of the<br>\
former, Msb, [and not so commonly used, like as<br>\
إِبْلٌ is not so commonly used as إِبِلٌ,]) The back;<br>\
syn. ظَهْرٌ: (S, A, B, K;) the first signification<br>\
given in the [S and] A and B: pl. أَدْبَارٌ. (TA.)<br>\
You say, وَلَّى دُبُرَهُ [lit., He turned his back;<br>\
and tropically,] (tropical:)  he was put to flight. (A.)<br>\
And وَلَّاهُ دُبُرَهُ [lit., He turned his back to him;<br>\
and tropically,] the same as the phrase immediately preceding. (Mgh, Msb.) It is said in<br>\
the Kur [liv. 45], وَيُوَلُّونَ الدُّبُرَ [And they shall<br>\
turn the back, in flight]: where الدبر is used in a<br>\
collective sense, agreeably with another passage<br>\
in the Kur [xiv. 44], لَا يَرْتَدُّ إِلَيْهِمْ طَرْفُهُمْ. (S, B.)<br>\
You also say, ↓ وَلَّوْا دَبْرَةً (tropical:)  They turned back in<br>\
flight, or being routed. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The back,<br>\
or hinder part, contr. of قُبُلٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) of<br>\
anything: (Msb:) as, for instance, of a shirt.<br>\
(Kur xii. 25, 27, and 28.) You say, وَقَعَ السَّهْمُ<br>\
بِدُبْرِ الهَدَفِ The arrow fell behind the butt. (TA<br>\
in art. قبل.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The backside; posteriors; buttocks; rump; or podex: and the anus: syn.<br>\
اِسْتٌ. (K.) [It has the former of these two significations in many instances; and the latter of them<br>\
in many other instances: in the S and K in art.<br>\
جعر, it is given as a syn. of مَجْعَرٌ, which has the<br>\
latter signification in the present day. This latter<br>\
signification may also be intended in the S, M,<br>\
A, Msb, and K, by the explanation “ contr. of<br>\
قُبُلٌ,” as well as the “ back, or hinder part,” of<br>\
anything: for قُبُلٌ very often signifies the “ anterior pudendum ” of a man or woman, and is so<br>\
explained. The anus is also called حَلْقَةُ الدُّبُرِ<br>\
and حِتَارُ الدُّبُرِ and شَرَجُ الدُّبُرِ.] Its pl. أَدْبَارٌ is also<br>\
applied to the part which comprises the اِسْت [or<br>\
anus] and the حَيَآء [or vulva, i. e., external<br>\
portion of the female organs of generation,] of a<br>\
solid-hoofed animal, and of a cloven-hoofed<br>\
animal, and of that which has claws, or talons:<br>\
or, as some say, of a camel, or an animal having<br>\
feet like those of the camel: and the sing., to the<br>\
حَيَآء [or vulva] alone, of any such animal. (M,<br>\
TT.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  The latter, or last, part, (T, S, M,<br>\
Msb, K,) of a thing, an affair, or an event, (T,<br>\
S, Msb,) or of anything: (M, K:) pl. أَدْبَارٌ<br>\
(M) [and دِبَارٌ: see دَبَرِىٌّ]. [See also دَابِرٌ.]<br>\
One says, جِئْتُكَ دُبُرِ الشَّهْرِ, and فِى دُبُرِهِ, and عَلَى<br>\
دُبُرِهِ, and أَدْبَارَ الشَّهْرِ, and فِى أَدْبَارِهِ, (tropical:)  I came to<br>\
thee in the latter, or last, part or parts, of the<br>\
month. (M, K.) And أَدْعُو لَكَ فِى أَدْبَارِ الصَّلَوَاتِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [I will petition for thee in the latter, or last,<br>\
parts, or the conclusions, of the prayers]. (A.)<br>\
See also دَبَرِىٌّ. In the Kur [I. xxxix.], وَأَدْبَارَ<br>\
السُّجُودِ signifies (assumed tropical:)  And in the latter parts, or the<br>\
ends, of the prayers: and السُّجُودِ ↓ وَإِدْبَارَ [virtually] signifies the same [i. e. and in the ending<br>\
of prostration], and is another reading of the<br>\
text: Ks and Th adopt the former reading,<br>\
because every single prostration has its latter<br>\
part: or, accord. to the T, the meaning is, and in<br>\
the two rek&#39;ahs (الرَّكْعَتَانِ) after sunset; as is<br>\
related on the authority of &#39;Alee the son of Aboo-Tálib. (TA.) The similar expression in the<br>\
Kur [lii. last verse] وَأَدْبَارَ النُّجُومِ is explained<br>\
by the lexicologists as signifying (assumed tropical:)  And during<br>\
the consecution of the stars, and their taking<br>\
towards the west, to set: but [ISd says,] I know<br>\
not how this is, since أَخْذٌ, by which they explain<br>\
it, is an inf. n., and أَدْبَار is a pl. of a subst.:<br>\
النُّجُومِ ↓ وَإِدْبَارَ, which is another reading of the<br>\
text, signifies and during the setting of the stars:<br>\
and Ks and Th adopt this latter reading: (M:)<br>\
or, accord. to the T, both mean and in the two<br>\
rek&#39;ahs before daybreak. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also The<br>\
hinder part, (M,) and angle, (زَاوِيَة,) of a house<br>\
or chamber or tent. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  عِتْقَ العَبْدِ عَنْ<br>\
دُبُرٍ (S, K) means The emancipation of the slave<br>\
after the death of his owner. (S, Mgh, * Msb. *<br>\
[See 2.]) ―<br>\
-b7-  [See also دَبِيرٌ, of which, and of دِبَارٌ,<br>\
دُبُرٌ is said in the TA in art. قبل to be a pl.].<br>\
دَبْرَةٌ: see دُبُرٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A turn of evil fortune; an unfavourable turn of fortune: or a<br>\
turn to be vanquished; contr. of دَوْلَةٌ: (As, M,<br>\
K:) دَوْلَةٌ relates to good; and دَبْرَةٌ, to evil: one<br>\
says, جَعَلَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ الدَّبْرَةَ (assumed tropical:)  [May God make the<br>\
turn of evil fortune to be against him]: (As, T,<br>\
M:) this [says ISd] is the best explanation that<br>\
I have seen of دَبْرَةٌ: (M:) or (so accord. to the<br>\
M, but in the K “ and ”) it signifies (assumed tropical:)  the issue,<br>\
or result, of a thing or an affair or a case; (M,<br>\
K;) as in the saying of Aboo-Jahl to Ibn-Mes&#39;ood, when he [the former] lay prostrate,<br>\
wounded, لِمَنِ الدَّبْرَةُ (assumed tropical:)  In whose favour is the<br>\
issue, or result? and was answered, “In favour<br>\
of God and his apostle, O enemy of God: ” (T,<br>\
TA:) also (tropical:)  defeat in fight; (S, A, Mgh, K;)<br>\
a subst. from الإِدْبَارُ, as also ↓ دَبَرَةٌ, (S,) and ↓ دَابِرَةٌ:<br>\
(IAar, A, K:) you say, كَانَتِ الدَّبْرَةُ لَهُ, meaning (tropical:)  His adversary was defeated; and عَلَيْهِ<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  He was himself defeated: (A:) and<br>\
لِمَنِ الدَّبْرَةُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Who is the defeater? and<br>\
عَلَىمَنِ الدَّبْرَةُ (assumed tropical:)  Who is the defeated? the pl.<br>\
of دَبْرَةٌ in the last sense is دِبَارٌ: (TA:) which<br>\
also signifies conflicts and defeats; (K;) as in<br>\
the saying, أَوْقَعَ اللّٰهُ بِهِمُ الدِّبَارَ God caused, or<br>\
may God cause, to befall them conflicts and<br>\
defeats. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also دَبْرٌ, in two places.<br>\
دِبْرَةٌ The direction, or point, towards which one<br>\
turns his back; contr. of قِبْلَةٌ. (S, K.) One<br>\
says, مَا لَهُ قِبْلَةٌ وَلَا دِبْرَةٌ, meaning (tropical:)  He has no<br>\
way of applying himself rightly to his affair.<br>\
(S, K, TA.) And لَيْسَ لِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ قِبْلَةٌ وَلَا دِبْرَةٌ<br>\
(tropical:)  The right way of executing this affair is not<br>\
known. (S, A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also إِدْبَارَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  And see<br>\
دَبْرٌ, near the end.<br>\

دَبَرَى: see 1.<br>\
دَبْرِىٌّ: see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
دَبَرِىٌّ [Backward: and hence, (tropical:)  late]. You<br>\
say, العِلْمُ قَبَلِىٌّوَلَيْسَ بِالدَّبَرِىِّ (assumed tropical:)  [True learning is<br>\
prompt, and is not backward]: i. e., the man of<br>\
sound learning answers thee quickly; but the backward says, I must consider it. (Th, T.) And<br>\
تَبِعْتُ صَاحِبِى دَبَرِيًّا (assumed tropical:)  I followed my companion,<br>\
fearing that he would escape me, after having<br>\
been with him, and having fallen back from him.<br>\
(M.) And شَرُّ الرَّأْىِ الدَّبَرِىُّ (T, S, A, K *) (tropical:)  The<br>\
worst opinion, or  counsel, is that which occurs [to<br>\
one] late, when the want [of it] is past; (T, S,<br>\
K, * TA;) i. e., when the affair is past: or رَأْىٌ<br>\
دَبَرِىٌّ signifies an opinion, or a counsel, not<br>\
deeply looked into; and in like manner, جَوَابٌ,<br>\
an answer, or a reply. (M.) And فُلَانٌ لَا يُصَلِّى<br>\
الصَّلَاةَ إِلَّا دَبَرِيًّا (AZ, S, M, A, K) and ↓ دَبْرِيًّا,<br>\
(AHeyth, K,) and the relaters of traditions say<br>\
↓ دُبُرِيًّا, (S,) which is said in the K to be a corruption, but it may have been heard from a good<br>\
authority, and with respect to the rules of the<br>\
language is chaste, for, accord. to IAth, دَبَرِىٌّ is<br>\
a rel. n. irregularly formed from دُبُرٌ, (TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  Such a one performs not prayer save in the<br>\
last part of its time. (AZ, S, K *) It is said in<br>\
a trad., لَا يَأْتِى الصَّلَاةِ إِلَّا دَبَرِيًّا; and in another,<br>\
↓ الّا دُبْرًا or ↓ دَبْرًا, accord. to different relations;<br>\
(tropical:)  He will not come to prayer save at the last, or<br>\
late: and in another, ↓ أَتَى الصَّلَاةَ دِبَارًا (tropical:)  He came<br>\
to prayer at the latest of the times thereof;<br>\
(IAar, TA;) or after the time had gone: (S:)<br>\
↓ دِبَارٌ being a pl. of ↓ دُبُرٌ and ↓ دُبْرٌ meaning the<br>\
last of the times of prayer &amp;c. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
One says also, ↓ جَآءَ فُلَانٌ دَبْرِيًّا (tropical:)  Such a one came<br>\
last, or latest. (A, * TA.) دبريًّا is in the accus.<br>\
case as an adv. n. of time [like دُبْرًا and دَبْرًا and<br>\
دِبَارًا], or as a denotative of state with respect to<br>\
the agent of the verb. (TA.) In the passage in the<br>\
K [where it is said that دَبَرِىٌّ signifies Prayer in<br>\
the last of its time, &amp;c.], there is a looseness.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
دُبُرِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\

prose,]) and ↓ دِبَارٌ, (K,) Wednesday; the fourth<br>\
day of the week; (S, K;) an ancient name<br>\
thereof: (S, M, * TA:) or, accord. to the &#39;Eyn,<br>\
(K,) the night of [i. e. preceding the day of]<br>\
Wednesday: (M, K:) which latter explanation<br>\
is preferred by some authorities. (TA.) Wednesday is a day of ill luck: Mujáhid, being asked<br>\
respecting the day of ill luck, answered, “The<br>\

the last Wednesday,] in the month. ” (TA.)<br>\

إِدْبَارَةٌ A slit in the ear [of a ewe or she-goat or<br>\
she-camel], which being made, that thing [thus<br>\
made, meaning the pendulous strip,] is twisted,<br>\
and turned backward: if turned forward, it is<br>\
termed إِقْبَالَةٌ: and the hanging piece of skin of<br>\
the ear is termed إِدْبَارَةٌ [in the former case]<br>\
and إِقْبَالَةٌ [in the latter case]; as though it were<br>\
a زَنَمَة [q. v.]; (As, S, M, * K;) and, respectively,<br>\
↓ إِدْبَارٌ and إِقْبَالٌ, and ↓ دِبْرَةْ and قِبْلَةٌ. (TA in<br>\
art. قبل.) The ewe or she-goat [to which this<br>\
has been done] is termed ↓ مُدَابَرَةٌ [in the former<br>\
case] and مُقَابَلَةٌ [in the latter]: and you say of<br>\
yourself [when you have performed the operation,<br>\
in these two cases respectively], دَابَرْتُهَا and قَابَلْتُهَا:<br>\
and the she-camel is termed ذَاتُ إِدْبَارَة and ذَاتُ<br>\
إِقْبَالَةٌ; (As, S, K;) and so is the ewe or she-goat; (As, T;) and the she-camel, ↓ ذَاتُ إِدْبَارٍ<br>\

receive admonition. (IKtt.) [See أُخَايِلٌ.]<br>\
مُدْبِرٌ [Going, turning his back; turning back;<br>\
&amp;c.: see its verb, 4]. You say, مَا لَهُمْ مِنْ مُقْبِلٍ<br>\
وَلَا مُدْبِرٍ They have not one that goes forward<br>\
nor one that goes back. (A.) In the phrase in<br>\
the Kur [ix. 25], ثُمَّ وَلَّيْتُمْ مُدْبِرِينَ [Then ye<br>\
turned back retreating], the last word is a corroborative denotative of state; for with every تَوْلِيَة<br>\
is إِدْبَار. (M.) See also دَابِرٌ. ―<br>\

think that there is an omission, and that the<br>\
latter phrase has the contr. meaning.])<br>\
مَدْبَرَةٌ i. q. إِدْبَارٌ [inf. n. of 4, q. v.]. (M.)<br>\
مُدَبَّرٌ A slave made to be free after his owner&#39;s<br>\

(TA.)<br>\
مُدَبِّرٌ [is extensively and variously applied as<br>\
meaning One who manages, conducts, orders, or<br>\
regulates, affairs of any kind, but generally<br>\
affairs of importance]. فَالْمَدَبِّرَاتِ أَمْرًا, in the<br>\
Kur [lxxix. 5], signifies [accord. to most of the<br>\
Expositors] And those angels who are charged<br>\
with the managing, conducting, ordering, or<br>\

-b2-  مُدَابَرَةٌ<br>\

applied, Having a portion of the hinder part of<br>\
her ear cut, and left hanging down, not separated:<br>\
and also when it is separated: and مُقَابَلَةٌ is<br>\
applied in like manner to one having a portion<br>\
of the extremity [or fore part] of the ear so cut:<br>\
(As, T:) and the former, applied to a she-camel,<br>\
having her ear slit in the part next the back of<br>\
the neck: or having a piece cut off from that<br>\
part of her ear: and in like manner applied to a<br>\
ewe or she-goat: also an ear cut, or slit, in the<br>\
hinder part. (M.) [It seems that a she-camel<br>\
had her ear thus cut if of generous race. And<br>\

arrows in the رِبَابَة in that game. (TA.) [See an<br>\
ex. in a verse cited in art. خض.]<br>\
فُلَانٌ مُسْتَدْبِرٌ المَجْدِ مُسْتَقْبِلُهُ (tropical:)  Such a one is<br>\
[as though he had behind him and before him<br>\
honour or dignity or nobility; meaning that he<br>\
is] generous, or noble, in respect of his first and<br>\
