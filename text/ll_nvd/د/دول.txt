دَالَ i. q. دَارَ. (TA.) You say, دالتِ الأَيَّامُ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) aor. تَدُولُ, (Msb,) inf. n. دَوْلٌ,<br>\
(KL,) meaning دَارَت; (S, Msb, K;) [i. e.] The<br>\
days came round [in their turns]. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
دَوْلٌ also signifies The changing of time, or<br>\
fortune, from one state, or condition, to another;<br>\
(K;) and so دَوْلَةٌ. (TA.) [Hence,] one says,<br>\
دالت لَهُ الدَّوْلَةُ [The turn of fortune was, or<br>\
became, in his favour; or] good fortune came to<br>\
him: and دالت عَلَيْهِ الدَّوْلَةُ [The turn of fortune<br>\
was, or became, against him; or] good fortune<br>\
departed from him. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Golius assigns<br>\
to دال, with دَوْلَةٌ for its inf. n., as on the authority of the S and KL, two significations app.<br>\
from two meanings of دَوْلَةٌ, one of which he<br>\
seems to have misunderstood, and to neither of<br>\
which do I find any corresponding verb: they<br>\
are “ Obivit alter alterum in bello: ” and “ superior<br>\
evasit. ” There are many inf. ns. that have no<br>\
corresponding verbs.] ―<br>\
-b4-  دال, aor. يَدُوِلُ, (T, K,)<br>\
inf. n. دَوْلٌ and دَالَةٌ, (K,) or دَوْلَةٌ, (T,) He<br>\
became notorious [either in a bad or in a good<br>\
sense]; expl. by صَارَ شُهْرَةً, (IAar, T, K,) i. e.<br>\
مَشْهُورًا. (TK.) ―<br>\
-b5-  دال الثَّوْبُ, aor. يَدُولُ, The<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth, was, or became, old, and<br>\
worn out. (AZ, S.) [Hence,] جَعَلَ وُدُّهُ يَدُولُ<br>\
(tropical:)  His love, or affection, was beginning to become,<br>\
or at the point of becoming, worn out. (AZ, S,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See also 7.<br>\
2<br>\
دوّل He wrote a د. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
داول, [inf. n. مُدَاوَلَةٌ,] He made to come<br>\
round [by turns, or to be by turns]: hence the<br>\
saying in the Kur [iii. 134], و تِلْكَ الْأَيَّامُ نُدَاوِلُهَا<br>\
بَيْنَ النَّاسِ And those days, we make them to come<br>\
round [by turns] to men: (S, * K, * TA:) or this<br>\
means, we dispense them by turns to men; (Bd,<br>\
Jel;) to these one time, and to these another;<br>\
(Bd;) or one day to one party, and one day to<br>\
another. (Jel.) You say, دَاوَلْتُ الشَّىْءَ بَيْنَهُمْ<br>\
↓ فَتَدَاوَلُوهُ [I dispensed the thing among them by<br>\
turns, and they had, or received, or took, it by<br>\
turns]. (Bd on the passage of the Kur quoted<br>\
above.) مُدَاوَلَةٌ also signifies The giving a turn<br>\
of fortune, or good fortune. (KL. [See what<br>\
next follows.])<br>\
4<br>\
ادالهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. إِدَالَةٌ, (T, TA,) [signifying He gave him a turn of good fortune, or a<br>\
turn to prevail over another in war, &amp;c.,] is<br>\
from الدَّوْلَةُ. (T, M, K, TA. [See what next precedes.]) Hence, [in the CK from الدُّولَة,] the<br>\
saying, أَدَالَنَا اللّٰهُ مِنْ عَدُوِّنَا [God gave us, or may<br>\
God give us, a turn to prevail over our enemy].<br>\
(S, K.) And أَدَالَكَ اللّٰهُ مِنْ عَدُوِّكَ and عَلَى عَدُوِّكَ,<br>\
i. e. جَعَلَ لَكَ عَلَيْهِ دَوْلَةً [May God appoint thee,<br>\
or give thee, a turn to prevail over thine enemy].<br>\
(Ham p. 547.) And ادال اللّٰهُ زَيْدًا مِنْ عَمْرٍو<br>\
[God gave to Zeyd a turn to have the superiority<br>\
over &#39;Amr;] i. e. God took away the turn of<br>\
good fortune, or the good fortune, (الدولة,) from<br>\
&#39;Amr, and gave it to Zeyd. (Har p. 118.)<br>\
Hence, also, (TA,) El-Hajjáj said, إِنَّ الأَرْضَ<br>\
سَتُدَالُ مِنَّا كَمَا أُدِلْنَا مِنْهَا [Verily the earth will<br>\
be given (?) turn to prevail over us, like as we have<br>\
been given a turn to prevail over it]; (Lth, T,<br>\
TA;) meaning that it will consume us, like as<br>\
we have consumed [of] it. (T, TA.) And<br>\
[hence] إِدَالَةٌ signifies غَلَبَةٌ [or Victory]: (S, K:)<br>\
or [rather], as some say, it signifies نُصْرَةٌ [i. e.<br>\
aid against an enemy]: (Har ubi suprà:) you<br>\
say, اَللّٰهُمَ أَدِلْنِى عَلَى فُلَانٌ O God, aid me against<br>\
such a one. (S, and Har ubi suprà. [In the<br>\
former, وَانْصُرْنِىعَلَيْهِ, as an explicative adjunct:<br>\
in the latter, اى نصِّرنى عليه, for انْصُرْنِى.])<br>\
6<br>\
تَدَاوَلُوهُ They took it, or had it, by turns.<br>\
(S, Msb, K. See 3.) You say, تَدَاوَلْنَا الأَمْرَ We<br>\
took [or did] the affair by turns. (M.) And<br>\
تَدَاوَلْنَا العَمَلَ وَ الأَمْرَبَيْنَنَا We did the work, and<br>\
the thing, or affair, by turns, among us. (T.)<br>\
And تَدَاوَلُوا البَاطِلَ They took it by turns to say,<br>\
or to do, that which was false, wrong, vain,<br>\
futile, or the like; syn. تَبَطَّلُوا بَيْنَهُمْ. (Az and K<br>\
in art. بطل.) And تَدَاوَلَتْهُ الأَيْدِى The hands<br>\
took it by turns. (S.) And تَدَاوَلَتِ الرِّيَاحُ رَسْمَ<br>\
الدَّارَ The winds blew by turns upon, or over, the<br>\
remains that marked the site of the house [so as<br>\
to efface them]; one time from the south, and<br>\
another time from the north, and another time<br>\
from the east, and another time from the west.<br>\
(Az, TA in art. عور.) And, of a thing, you say,<br>\
يُتَدَاوَلُ (T) or يُتَدَاوَلُ بِهِ (S) [meaning It is<br>\
taken, or done, by turns]. And تُدُوْوِلَتِ الأَرْضُ<br>\
بِالرَّعْىِ [The land was pastured on by turns].<br>\
(S and K in art. وظب.) [تَدَاوَلُوهُ also signifies<br>\
They made frequent use of it; i. e., used it time<br>\
after time, or turn after turn; namely, a word<br>\
or phrase: but perhaps in this sense it is postclassical: see an ex. in De Sacy&#39;s “ Chrest.<br>\
Arabe,” sec. ed., p. 141 of the Arabic text.]<br>\
And تَدَاوَلَتِ الأَشْيَآءُ The things alternated; or<br>\
succeeded one another by turns, one taking the<br>\
place of another: (L in art. نسخ:) and [in like<br>\
manner] الأَزْمَنَةُ [the times]. (Msb and K in that<br>\
art.) [See also 6 in art دفو.]<br>\
7<br>\
اندال القَوْمُ The people, or party, removed,<br>\
or shifted, from one place to another. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
اندال مَا فِىبَطْنِهِ What was in his belly, (M, K,)<br>\
of intestines or peritonæum, (M,) came forth,<br>\
(M, K,) in consequence of its being pierced.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اندال It (the belly) became wide,<br>\
and near, or approaching, to the ground. (M, K.)<br>\
Also (K) It (the belly) was, or became, flaccid,<br>\
flabby, or pendulous; (S, O, K;) and so ↓ دَالَ.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And It (a thing) dangled, or moved to<br>\
and fro; and hung. (M, K.)<br>\
دَالٌ One of the letters of the alphabet, (د,) the<br>\
place of utterance of which is near to that of ت:<br>\
masc. and fem.; so that you say دَالٌ حَسَنٌ and<br>\
حَسَنَةٌ [a beautiful د]: the pl. is أَدْوَالٌ if masc.,<br>\
and دَالَاتٌ [if fem.; the latter the more common].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A fat woman. (Kh, TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
See also دَالَةٌ.<br>\
دَوْلٌ an inf. n. of دَالَ in senses explained above.<br>\
(K, KL.)<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. دَلْوٌ [A bucket]: (K:)<br>\
[an arabicized word from the Pers. دُولْ: or]<br>\
formed from دَلْوٌ by transposition. (TA.)<br>\
دَوَلٌ, as an epithet applied to نَبْلٌ [or arrows]<br>\
i. q. ↓ مُتَدَاوَلٌ. (IAar, M, K. *) So in the saying,<br>\
يُلُوذُ بِالجَوْدِ مِنَ النَّبْلِ الدَّوَلْ<br>\
[app. relating to a wild animal, and meaning. He<br>\
seeks, or takes, refuge in the copious rain from the<br>\
arrows received in turns by one after another of<br>\
the herd]. (IAar, M.)<br>\
-A2-  See also دَوْلَةٌ.<br>\
دَالَةٌ i. q. شُهْرَةٌ [Notoriousness, &amp;c.]: pl. [or<br>\
rather coll. gen. n.] ↓ دَالٌ. (IAar, T, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Accord. to the K, it is also an inf. n.: see 1.]<br>\
دَوْلَةٌ A turn, mutation, change, or vicissitude,<br>\
of time, or fortune, (K, TA,) from an unfortunate and evil, to a good and happy, state or<br>\
condition; (TA;) [i. e.,] relating to good; as<br>\
دَبْرَةٌ, on the contrary, relates to evil: (As, T and<br>\
M in art. دبر:) [therefore meaning a turn of good<br>\
fortune; a favourable turn of fortune: or] good<br>\
fortune [absolutely]: (KL:) a happy state or<br>\
condition, that betides a man: (MF:) [also] a<br>\
turn which comes to one or which one takes [in<br>\
an absolute sense]; syn. نَوْبَةٌ: (K in art. نوب:)<br>\
and [particularly] (K) a turn (عُقْبَةٌ) [to share]<br>\
in wealth, and [to prevail] in war; as also ↓ دُولَةٌ:<br>\
(&#39;Eesà Ibn-&#39;Omar, * T, * S, * M, K: *) or each is<br>\
a subst. [in an absolute sense, app. as meaning a<br>\
turn of taking, or having, a thing,] from تَدَاوَلُوا<br>\
الشَّىْءَ signifying “ they took, or had, the thing by<br>\
turns: ” (Msb:) or ↓ دُولَةٌ is in wealth; and دَوْلَةٌ<br>\
is in war; (Aboo-&#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;Alà, T, S, M,<br>\
Msb, K;) this latter being when one of two<br>\
armies defeats the other and then is defeated;<br>\
(Fr, T;) or when one party is given a turn to<br>\
prevail (تُدَال) over the other: one says, كَانَتْ<br>\
لَنَا عَلَيْهِمُ الدَّوْلَةُ فِى الحَرْبِ [The turn to prevail<br>\
over them in war was ours]: (S:) and قَدْ رَجَعَتِ<br>\
الدَّوْلَةُ عَلَى هٰؤُلَآءِ [The turn to prevail against<br>\
these returned]; as though meaning المَرَّةُ: so<br>\
says Fr: but ↓ دُولَةٌ, he says, is in religions and<br>\
institutions that are altered and changed with<br>\
time: (T:) accord. to Zj, (T,) or A&#39;Obeyd, (so<br>\
in two copies of the S,) ↓ دُولَةٌ signifies a thing<br>\
that is taken by turns; and دَوْلَةٌ, the act [of<br>\
taking by turns]; (T, S;) and a transition from<br>\
one state, or condition, to another: (T: [in this<br>\
last sense, app. an inf. n.: see 1, third sentence:])<br>\
you say, بَيْنَهُمْ ↓ صَارَ الفَىْءُ دُولَةً, meaning [The فىء<br>\
(or spoil, &amp;c.,) became] a thing taken by turns<br>\
among them: (S:) and the saying, in the<br>\
Kur [lix. 7], بَيْنَ الأَغْنِيَآءِ مِنْكُمْ ↓ كَىْ لَا يَكُونَ دُولَةً<br>\
means That it may not be a thing taken by turns<br>\
[among the rich of you]: (T:) or دَوْلَةٌ relates to<br>\
the present life or world; and ↓ دُولَةٌ, to that<br>\
which is to come: (M, K:) and it is said that<br>\
the former of these two words signifies prevalence, predominance, mastery, or victory; and<br>\
↓ the latter, the transition of wealth, blessing, or<br>\
good, from one people, or party, to another:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. (of دَوْلَةٌ, S, Msb) is دَوِلٌ, (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K,) like as قِصَعٌ is pl. of قَصْعَةٌ, (Msb,) and<br>\
(of ↓ دُولَةٌ, T, S, Msb), دُوَلٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K)<br>\
and دُولَاتٌ, (S, TA,) and ↓ دَوَلٌ (M, K) is [a<br>\
quasi-pl. n.] of both, because, as IJ says, دَوْلَةٌ is<br>\
regarded as though it were originally دُولَةٌ. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [In post-classical works, it signifies also A<br>\
dynasty: and a state, an empire, or a monarchy.]<br>\
-A2-  Also The حَوْصَلَة [or stomach of a bird; its<br>\
triple stomach: or only its first stomach; the<br>\
crop, or craw]: because of its اِنْدِيَال [or flaccidity]. (Ibn-&#39;Abbaád, K.) And The قَانِصَة<br>\
[which may here mean the same as the حوصلة,<br>\
for this is one of the meanings assigned to it, and<br>\
this explanation of دولة is not given by Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád: or it may here mean the intestines, of a<br>\
bird, into which the food passes from the stomach:<br>\
or the gizzard]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The شِقْشِقَة [or<br>\
faucial bag of the he-camel]. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And A thing like a مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag] with a narrow mouth. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And The side of the belly. (K.) [But]<br>\
accord. to Ibn-&#39;Abbád, مَا أَعْظَمَ دَوْلَةَ بَطْنِهِ means<br>\
How large is his navel! (TA.)<br>\
دوُلَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in nine<br>\
places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also what next follows, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
دُوَلَةٌ (T, S, K) and ↓ دِوَلَةٌ (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA)<br>\
[and ↓ دُولَةٌ, as appears from what follows]; as<br>\
also تُوَلَةٌ (T, S) [and تِوَلَةٌ and تُوَلةٌ]; A calamity,<br>\
or misfortune: (T, Ibn-&#39;Abbád, S, K:) pl. دُوَلَاتٌ<br>\
(S) and دِوَلَاتٌ and دُوَلَاتٌ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA.)<br>\
You say, جَآءَ بِدُوَلَاتِهِ (S) [and ↓ بِدِوَلَاتِهِ] and<br>\
↓ بِدُولَاتِهِ (Ibn-&#39;Abbad, TA) and ↓ بِدُولَاهُ, as also<br>\
بِتُولَاهُ, (Aboo-Málik, K,) He, or it, came with,<br>\
or brought, or brought to pass, his, or its, calamities, or misfortunes: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, S, K. *)<br>\
دِوَلَةٌ: and جَآءَبِدَوَلَاتِهِ: see دُوَلَةٌ.<br>\
جَآءَ بِدُولَاهُ: see دُوَلَةٌ.<br>\
دَوِيلٌ A plant that is a year old, (S, M, K,)<br>\
and dry: (M, K:) or two years old, (AZ, K,)<br>\
and worthless: (AZ, TA:) or especially what is<br>\
dry of the [plants called] نَصِىّ and سَبَط: (M, K, *<br>\
TA:) or any plant broken and black. (TA.)<br>\
دَوَالِىُّ A sort of grapes of Et-Táïf, (M, K,)<br>\
black inclining to redness. (M.) [See also دَوَالٍ,<br>\
in art. دلو.]<br>\
دَوَالَيْكَ i. q. مُدَاوَلَةً, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
مُتَداوَلَةً,] used in an imperative sense [with its<br>\
verb and the objective complement thereof understood before it, and thus meaning دَاوِلِ الفِعْلَ<br>\
مُدَاوَلَةً Make thou the action to come round, or<br>\
to be, by turns]: (M, K:) or it may be rendered<br>\
as meaning that the thing happened in this<br>\
manner [i. e. the action being made to come<br>\
round, or to be, by turns]: (Sb, M:) or it means<br>\
تَدَاوُلٌ بَعْدَ تَدَاوُل [i. e. a taking, or doing, (a<br>\
thing) by turn after (another&#39;s) doing so, and<br>\
may be rendered virtually in the same manner as<br>\
above, i. e. let the action be done by turns: or<br>\
the action being done by turns]: (S, O, K: [in<br>\
the PS, تَدَاوُلًا بَعْدَ تَدَاوُلٍ, which better explains<br>\
the two manners in which it is said to be used:])<br>\
IAar says that it is an invariable expression, like<br>\
حَجَازَيْكَ and هَذَاذَيْكَ; and is from the phrase<br>\
تَدَاوَلُوا الأَمْرَ بَيْنَهُمْ, said of persons when this takes<br>\
a turn and this a turn. (T, TA.) &#39;Abd-Beni-l-<br>\
Has-hás says,<br>\
إِذَ شُقَّ بُرْدٌ شُقَّ بِالبُرْدِ مِثْلُهُ<br>\
دَوَالَيْكَ حَتَّى لَيْسَ لِلْبُرْدِ لَابِسُ<br>\
[When a burd (a kind of garment) is rent, the<br>\
like thereof is rent with the burd, the action being<br>\
done by turns, so that there is no wearer of the<br>\
burd; it having been rent so as to fall off]:<br>\
(S:) the poet is speaking of a man&#39;s rending<br>\
the clothing of a woman to see her person, and<br>\
her rending his also. (T, TA. [This verse is<br>\
related with several variations: see another reading of it voce هَذَاذَيْكَ, in art. هذ; with another<br>\
explanation of it.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Ibn-Buzurj says, (T,)<br>\
sometimes the article ال is prefixed to it, so that<br>\
one says الدَّوَالَيْكَ, (T,) meaning One&#39;s walking<br>\
with an elegant and a proud and self-conceited<br>\
gait, with an affected inclining of the body from<br>\
side to side, (T,) or one&#39;s urging, or pressing<br>\
forward, and striving, (أَنْ يَتَحَفَّزَ, [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, ان يَتَحَفَّزَ,]) in his gait, or pace,<br>\
(K,) when he moves about his shoulder-joints, and<br>\
parts his legs widely, in walking. (T, K,* TA.<br>\
In the copies of the K, جال [or جاءك] is erroneously put for حَاكَ, the reading in the T, TA.<br>\
[The author of the TK follows the reading<br>\
جال; and has fallen into several other evident<br>\
mistakes in explaining this expression; which is<br>\
itself, in my opinion, when with the article ال, a<br>\
mistake for الدَّوَالِيْكُ, mentioned in art. دلك.])<br>\
A poet uses the phrase يَمْشِى الدَّوَالَيْكَ as meaning Walking, or going, in the manner explained<br>\
above: (Ibn-Buzurj, T and TA in the present<br>\
art.:) or يَمْشِى الدَّوَالِيكَ. (TA in art. دلك.)<br>\
مُنْدَالٌ as meaning Dangling, or moving to and<br>\
fro; and hanging; is said by Seer to be of the<br>\
measure مُنْفَعِلٌ from التَّدَلَّى, and formed by<br>\
transposition; and if so, it has no inf. n.; for the<br>\
word that is formed by transposition has no inf. n.<br>\
(M. [But for this assertion I see no satisfactory<br>\
reason.])<br>\
