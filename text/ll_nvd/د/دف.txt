دَفَّ, (M, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
دَفِ3َ, (T, M, TA,)<br>\
or<br>\
دَفُ3َ, (Msb, [but this is a deviation from a<br>\
general rule, and is probably a mistake,]) inf. n.<br>\
دَفِيفٌ (Lth, T, S, M, Msb) and دَفٌّ; (M, TA;)<br>\
and ↓ ادفّ; (Ibn-&#39; Abbád, M, Msb, K;) said of a<br>\
bird, (Lth, T, S, &amp;c.,) It beat its sides (دَفَّيْهِ, i. e.,<br>\
Msb, جَنْبَيْهِ, M, Msb) with its wings: (M, Msb:)<br>\
this is what is meant by the following explanation: (Msb:) it moved [or flapped] its wings<br>\
(Msb, K) for its flight, (Msb,) as the pigeon (K)<br>\
and the like: (TA:) and it went [or flew] along<br>\
a little above the ground: (S, K:) or it moved<br>\
[or flapped] its wings, with its feet upon the<br>\
ground, (Lth, T, M, K,) flying, and then rose;<br>\
(Lth, T;) and in like manner ↓ دَفْدَفَ and<br>\
↓ استدفّ: (K:) [or] دفّ and ↓ ادفّ signify also<br>\
it (a bird) went along quickly, with its feet upon<br>\
the ground, and then raised itself flying. (Msb.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., يُؤْكَلُ مَا دَفَّ وَلَا ُؤْكَلُ مَا<br>\
صَفَّ, (K, * TA,) i. e. What moves [or flaps] its<br>\
wings [in flying], as the pigeon (K, TA) and the<br>\
like, (TA,) may be eaten; but [what skims along<br>\
without flapping,] such as vultures (K, TA) and<br>\
hawks and the like, (TA,) may not be eaten.<br>\
(K, * TA.) [But] دَفَّ, aor.<br>\
دَفِ3َ, said of an eagle,<br>\
signifies It approached, or was near to, the<br>\
ground in its flying. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, دَفَّ, aor.<br>\
دَفِ3َ,<br>\
(M, Msb,) inf. n. دَفِيفٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and دَفٌّ,<br>\
(K,) He, or it, (said of a camel, K, TA, and of<br>\
a bird, TA, or of a party of men, Msb,) went a<br>\
gentle pace; (S, M, Msb, K;) as also ↓ دَفْدَفَ.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) Dhu-r-Rummeh uses it metaphorically in relation to الدَّبَرَانِ [the asterism of the<br>\
Hyades, or<br>\
α of Taurus], describing الثُّرَيَّا [the<br>\
Pleiades]; saying,<br>\
يَدِفُّ عَلَىآثَارِهَا دَبَرَانُهَا<br>\
فَلَا هُوَ مَسْبُوقٌ وَلَا هُوَ يَلْحَقُ<br>\
[Their Debarán goes along gently near after<br>\
them, so that it is not outstripped, nor does it<br>\
overtake]. (M.) [And ↓ تَدَافَّ, accord. to ISd,<br>\
seems to signify nearly the same: for it is immediately added in the M,] in the saying,<br>\
إِلَيْكَ أَشْكُو مَشْيَهَا تَدَافِيَا<br>\
مَشْىَ العَجُوزِ تَنْقُلُ الأَثَافِيَا<br>\
[app. complaining, to God, of the slowness of his<br>\
she-camel, as though meaning To Thee I complain of her pressing on slowly and laboriously,<br>\
like the gait of the old woman removing the three<br>\
stones for the support of the cooking-pot], the<br>\
poet means تَدَافُفًا. (M. [But I rather think that<br>\
the meaning here intended is, going along with<br>\
an inclining from side to side; perhaps from<br>\
دَفٌّ signifying the “ side. ” See also 6 in art.<br>\
دفو.]) One says also, الجَيْشُ يَدِفُّونَ نَحْوَ العَدُوِّ<br>\
The troops go gently, or leisurely, towards the<br>\
enemy. (S.) And دَفَّتْ عَلَيْنَا مِنْ بَنِى فُلَانٍ<br>\
↓ دَافَّةٌ [A company coming gently, or leisurely,<br>\
of the sons of such a one, so came to us]. (S.)<br>\
And مِنَ الأَعْرَابِ ↓ دَفَّتْ عَلَيْهِمْ دَافَّةٌ A company<br>\
of Arabs of the desert journeying leisurely in search<br>\
of herbage and sustenance [so] came to them. (Z,<br>\
TA.) And هُمْ قَوْمٌ يَدِفُّونَ, inf. n. دَفِيفٌ, They are a<br>\
party journeying together not a hard pace. (AA,<br>\
T.) And دَفَّ عَلَى وَجْهِ الأَرْضِ (IAar, T, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
دَفٌّ, (K, TA,) He went lightly upon the ground;<br>\
(K, * TA;) and ذَفَّ signifies the same. (IAar,<br>\

(EM p. 233:) [or the meaning is, as though she<br>\
were shrinking with the outside of her off side;<br>\
lit, with the side of her off side; for, accord. to<br>\
ISd,] this is an instance of the prefixing of a<br>\
noun to another identical therewith [in signification]. (M.) [Hence also,] رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ بِذَاتِ الدَّفِّ<br>\

pairs of tinkling plates of brass in apertures in<br>\
the hoop, and sometimes, as in the kind used by<br>\
hired wailing-women, without those tinkling<br>\
plates;] and four-sided: [the latter seems to be<br>\

the two boards, meaning the whole contents, of<br>\
