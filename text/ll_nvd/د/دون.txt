دَانَ, aor. يَدُونُ, inf. n. دَوْنٌ; and ↓ أُدِينَ,<br>\
(S, K,) with damm, (K,) inf. n. إِدَانَةٌ; (S;) He,<br>\
or it, was, or became, such as is termed دُونٌ;<br>\
(S, K;) [i. e.] low, base, vile, &amp;c.: or weak:<br>\
(K:) mentioned by Er-Rághib on the authority<br>\
of IKt: (TA:) so say some: but accord. to<br>\
others, دُونٌ has no verb. (S, TA.) لَمْ يَدُنْ, (as<br>\
in my copies of the S,) or لم يُدَنْ, (as in the<br>\
TA,) at the end of a verse of &#39;Adee, as some<br>\
relate it, [perhaps the only authority for these<br>\
two verbs,] is accord. to others لم يدَنّْ, from دَنَّى<br>\
meaning “ he, or it, was, or became, weak. ”<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
دوّن الدَّيوَانَ, (inf. n. تَدْوِينٌ, TA,) He<br>\
wrote, composed, or drew up, the register [&amp;c.].<br>\
(S, * Msb, K, TA. *) And دوّن الدَّوَاوِينَ He<br>\
instituted, appointed, or arranged, the registers<br>\
for the prefects, or administrators, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
and the Kádees, (Mgh,) or others: (Msb:) said<br>\
of &#39;Omar; who is related to have been the first<br>\
that did this, (Mgh, Msb,) among the Arabs.<br>\
(Msb.) And دوّن الكُتُبَ He collected the writings.<br>\
(Mgh.) [And دوّن شِعْرَ فُلَانٍ He collected the<br>\
poetry of such a one.] And تَدْوِينٌ signifies also<br>\
The writing [a person&#39;s name &amp;c.] in a دِيوَان<br>\
[or register]. (KL.) You say, دوّنهُ He wrote it<br>\
[in a register]. (MA.) [And He registered<br>\
him.]<br>\
4<br>\
أُدِينَ, inf. n. إِدَانَةٌ: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  مَا أَدْوَنَهُ [as<br>\
meaning How low, base, vile, &amp;c., is he, or it!]<br>\
is [asserted to be] a phrase not used, (As, T, K,<br>\
TA,) because [it is said that] دُونٌ has no verb.<br>\
(As, T, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تدوّن He was, or became, in a state of complete richness, wealth, or competence. (IAar, T,<br>\
K.) [See also تذوّن. Perhaps both are correct,<br>\
as dial. vars.]<br>\
دُونً Low, base, vile, mean, paltry, inconsiderable, or contemptible; (Fr, T, S, M, * Msb, K;)<br>\
applied to a man &amp;c.: (T, Msb:) and inferior,<br>\
i. e. lower, baser, viler, &amp;c., in grounds of pretension to respect or honour [or in any approvable<br>\
quality]: (Lth, T:) and such as falls short [of a<br>\
thing]; used in this sense as a prefixed noun:<br>\
(Ham p. 686:) [see below what is said of its<br>\
usage as a prefixed noun by Lth and by Sb: and<br>\
used as an epithet, scanty, or deficient; applied<br>\
to anything:] and of a middling sort; between<br>\
good and bad; applied to a man and to a commodity: (M:) and also high, or eminent, in rank<br>\
or condition; noble, or honourable: (T, K:) thus<br>\
it bears two contr. significations (K) [and significations intermediate between those two]. A<br>\
poet says,<br>\
إِذَا مَا عَلَا المَرْءُ رَامَ العَلَآء<br>\
وَيَقْتَعُ بِالدُّونِ مَنْ كَانَا دُونَا<br>\
[When the man is high in rank, or nobility, he<br>\
seeks highness: and he who is low is content with<br>\
that which is low]. (S.) Accord. to the most<br>\
common usage, (Msb,) or accord. to what is<br>\
asserted to be the most common usage, (Lh, M,)<br>\
one says رَجُلٌ مِنْ دُونٍ (T, M, Msb, K) and<br>\
شَىْءٌ مِنْ دُونٍ (M, Msb) A man who is [of a<br>\
kind that is] low, base, &amp;c., and a thing that is<br>\
[of a kind that is] low, base, &amp;c.: (Msb:) but<br>\
sometimes they said رَجُلٌ دُونٌ and شَىْءٌ دُونٌ,<br>\
without مِنْ; (M, Msb;) and ثَوْبٌ دُونٌ a bad<br>\
[or an inferior] garment, or piece of cloth: (M:)<br>\
or one should not say رَجُلٌ دُونٌ; (T, K;) for the<br>\
Arabs did not use this phrase. (T.) Accord. to<br>\
Lth, one says, هٰذَا دُونُ ذَاكَ [This is the inferior<br>\
of that], when meaning to denote by it low estimation, using the nom. case: (T:) [but this is<br>\
uncommon, if allowable:] Sb says that دُون is<br>\
not used in the nom. case as a prefixed noun: as<br>\
to the saying in the Kur [lxxii. 11, an instance<br>\
similar to which occurs also in vii. 167], مِنَّا<br>\
الصَّالِحُونَ وَ مِنَّا دُونَ ذٰلِكَ, the meaning is, وَ مِنَّا<br>\
قَوْمٌ دُونَ ذٰلِكَ [i. e. Of us are the righteous, and of<br>\
us are a party below that party in rank or estimation]; (M, TA;) or, as another says, دون is<br>\
here in the accus. case but in the place of a noun<br>\
in the nom. case because it is generally used as an<br>\
adv. n. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  As an adv. n., دُون signifies<br>\
Below, contr. of فَوْق; (S, K;) as denoting a<br>\
falling short of the [right or approved] limit;<br>\
(S;) or denoting low, or mean, estimation or<br>\
condition; (Lth, T, M;) or a condition lower,<br>\
baser, viler, &amp;c., than that of another, in grounds<br>\
of pretension to respect or honour [or in any<br>\
approvable quality]; (Lth, T;) [and hence, inferior to, beneath, under, or short of, another in<br>\
rank, height, size, &amp;c.;] and less than another,<br>\
and more deficient than another: (Fr, T:) and<br>\
also above; i. q. فَوْق; (T, K;) in highness, or<br>\
eminence, of rank or condition, or in nobility;<br>\
(T;) [and hence, exceeding another, and more than<br>\
another:] thus bearing two contr. significations.<br>\
(K.) You say, زَيْدٌ دُونَكَ meaning Zeyd is [below<br>\
thee, or] in a condition lower, baser, viler, &amp;c.,<br>\
than thine, in grounds of pretension to respect or<br>\
honour [&amp;c.]: and when one says, “Verily such<br>\
a one is high, or eminent, in rank or condition,”<br>\
or “ is noble,” another replies, وَ دُونَ ذٰلِكَ meaning<br>\
And above that. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Beneath, below in<br>\
situation, or under; syn. تَحْت. (T, TA.) Using<br>\
it in this sense, you say, دُوَن قَدَمِكَ خَدُّ عَدُوِّكَ<br>\
[May the cheek of thine enemy be beneath thy foot]:<br>\
(T, TA:) and جَلَسَ دُونَهُ [He sat below him].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also Before in respect of place, or in<br>\
front: and [the contr., namely,] behind, or beyond.<br>\
(T, M, K.) [You may say, using it in the former<br>\
sense, جَلَسَ دُونَهُ He sat before him, or in front<br>\
of him: (see Ham p. 86:) and, using it in the<br>\
latter sense,] you say, هٰذَا أَمِيرٌ عَلَى مَا دُونَ<br>\
جَيْحُونَ This [man] is governor, or prince, over<br>\
what is beyond [the river] Jeyhoon. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And i. q. قَبْل [generally signifying Before in<br>\
respect of time; but as some say, in respect of<br>\
place also, which may perhaps be here meant]:<br>\
(T:) and [the contr., namely,] i. q. بَعْد [generally meaning after in respect of time; but as<br>\
some say, in respect of place also, which may<br>\
perhaps be here meant]. (Fr, T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  It<br>\
signifies also Nearer than another thing: (S,<br>\
Msb, K:) so in the phrase هٰذَا دُونَ ذٰلِكَ [This<br>\
is nearer than that]; (S Msb;) or هٰذَا دُونَهُ<br>\
[this is nearer than he, or it]. (K.) [Hence,]<br>\
one says also, اُدْنُ دُونَكَ meaning Draw thou<br>\
near in the space that is between me and thee:<br>\
(A Heyth, T:) [or approach thou nearer to me:]<br>\
or draw thou near [or nearer] to me. (IAar, T,<br>\
M, K.) And يَزِيدُ بَغُضُّ الطَّرْفَ دُونِى, a saying of<br>\
a poet, means Yezeed lowers the eye towards a<br>\
spot between me and him. (A Heyth, T.) [خَشَعَتْ<br>\
دُونَهُ الأَبْصَارُ, also, has a similar meaning: see 1 in<br>\
art. خشع. So, too, has the phrase, خَاوَتَ طَرْفَهُ<br>\
دُونِى: see 3 in art. خوت. And hence,] one<br>\
says, دُونَ النَّهْرِ جَمَاعَةٌ [In the way of, or to, the<br>\
river, or on this side of the river, or nearer than<br>\
the river, is a company of men; or] before thy<br>\
reaching the river [there is to be found, or encountered, a company of men]. (K.) And دُونَ قَتْلِ<br>\
الأَسَدِ أَهْوَالٌ [In the way of, or to, the slaying of<br>\
the lion, or] before thine attaining to the slaying<br>\
of the lion, terrors [are to be encountered]. (T,<br>\
TA.) [And دُونَهُ خَرْطُ القَتَادِ: see 1 in art. خرط.]<br>\
And حَالَ دُونَ الشَّىْءِ [It intervened as an obstacle<br>\
in the way to the thing; or] it prevented from<br>\
attaining the thing. (W p. 71.) [And لَيْسَ دُونَهُ<br>\
شَىْءٌ There is nothing intervening as an obstacle<br>\
in the way of, or to, him, or it.] And [hence,]<br>\
قُتِلَ دُونَ مَالِهِ, and نَفْسِهِ, and أَخِيهِ, and جَارِهِ, He<br>\
was slain in defence of his property, and of himself, and of his brother, and of his neighbour.<br>\
(Occurring in a trad. commencing with the words<br>\
الغَرِيقُ شَهِيدٌ, in the “ Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer,” and thus<br>\
explained in the margin of a copy of that work.)<br>\
[And نَبَحَ دُونَهُ is a modern phrase meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He defended him as though by barking in the<br>\
way to him.] ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence,] also i. q. عَلَى [as<br>\
meaning Against; denoting defence by means of<br>\
intervention: see an ex. in a verse cited voce<br>\
شَخْصٌ]. (Fr, T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And i. q. عِنْدَ [meaning At, near, nigh, by, or near by; with, or present with; &amp;c.]. (Fr, T, Ibn-Es-Seed.) Accord.<br>\
to Ez-Zowzanee, it has this meaning in the saying<br>\
of Imra-el-Keys, [describing a horse,]<br>\
فَأَلْحَقَنَا بِالهَادِيَاتِ وَ دُونَهُ<br>\
جَوَاحِرُهَا فِى صَرَّةٍ لَمْ تُزَيَّلِ<br>\
(TA, but only the former hemistich is there given,)<br>\
i. e. And he made us to overtake the foremost of<br>\
the wild animals, while near to him were those<br>\
that lagged behind, in a herd, not dispersed.<br>\
(EM p. 48.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And i. q. غَيْر [as meaning Other<br>\
than, beside, or besides, exclusively of, or not as<br>\
used before a substantive or an adjective]. (K.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [xxi. 82], وَيَعْمَلُونَ عَمَلًا دُونَ<br>\
ذٰلِكَ [And who should do work other than, or<br>\
beside, that]. (Fr, TA.) And in the same [iv.<br>\
51 and 116], وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذٰلِكَ But He will<br>\
forgive what is other than that: or, as some say,<br>\
what is less than that. (Er-Rághib, TA.) And<br>\
so, it is said, in the trad., لَيْسَ فِيمَا دُونَ خَمْسِ أَوَاقٍ<br>\
صَدَقَةٌ [There is no poor-rate to be exacted in the<br>\
case of what is other than, or not, or, rather<br>\
less than, five ounces]. (K.) So, too, it is said<br>\
to mean in the trad., أَجَازَ الخُلْعَ دُونَ عِقَاصِ رَأْسِهَا<br>\
[He allowed the divorcing a wife for a gift, or<br>\
compensation, other than the عِقَاص (q. v.) of her<br>\
head: in the CK, in which الخَلْعُ is erroneously<br>\
put for الخُلْعَ, this is given as an ex. of ذُونَ in the<br>\
sense of سَوِى, which is syn. with غَيْر]: or the<br>\
meaning is, for anything, even for the عقاص of<br>\
her head. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  It is also used (M, K,<br>\
TA) as a subst. (M, TA) with مِنْ prefixed to it,<br>\
[very often in this case, in the Kur and elsewhere,<br>\
as meaning غَيْر and sometimes in other senses<br>\
explained above,] and likewise with بِ (M, K,<br>\
TA,) though rarely. (K.) One says, هٰذَا دُونَكَ<br>\
and هٰذَا مِنْ دُونِكَ [This is below thee, or above<br>\
thee: &amp;c.]. (M, TA.) And it is said in the Kur<br>\
[xxviii. 23], وَوَجَدَ مِنْ دُونِهِمُ امْرَأَتَيْنِ (M, TA)<br>\
And he found in a place below them two women:<br>\
(Bd:) or beside them, or exclusively of them.<br>\
(Jel.) One says also, هٰدَا لِىدُونَ لَكَ or مِنْ دُونِكَ<br>\
[meaning This belongs to me exclusively of thee];<br>\
i. e. thou hast no right nor share [with me] in<br>\
this. (Kull p. 186.) The phrase فِيهِمْ مَنْ لَيْسَ<br>\
بِدُونِهِ [app. as meaning Among whom was such<br>\
as was not below him in respect of knowledge of<br>\
poetry] is used by Akh in his book on rhymes.<br>\
(M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  It also denotes a command, (T, K,)<br>\
and an incitement (Fr, T, S, K) to do a thing.<br>\
(S.) Using it in the former sense, you say,<br>\
دُونَكَ الدِّرْهَمَ, meaning Take thou the dirhem;<br>\
(T;) or دُونَكَ الشَّىْءَ and دُونَكَ بِالشَّىْءِ, meaning<br>\
Take thou the thing: (M:) and using it in the<br>\
latter sense, you say, دُونَكَهُ, (S, K, TA,) meaning<br>\
Keep thou, cleave thou, cling thou, or hold thou<br>\
fast, to him; and take care of him: (TA:) or<br>\
دُنَكَ زَيْدًا Keep thou, &amp;c., to Zeyd, taking care<br>\
of him. (T.) Temeem [meaning a party of the<br>\
tribe so named] said to El-Hajjáj, when he had<br>\
slain, i. e. crucified, Sálih Ibn-&#39; Abd-Er-Rahmán,<br>\
“ Permit us to bury Sálih: ” and he replied,<br>\
دُونَكُمُوهُ [Take ye him]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-  And it also<br>\
denotes a threat. (T, K.) So in the sayings<br>\
دُوَكَ صِرَاعِى [Beware thou of wrestling with me]<br>\
and دُونَكَ فَتَمَرَّسْ بِى [Beware thou, and then set<br>\
thyself against me to do evil if thou canst]. (T,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b13-  It is said that no verb is derived from it:<br>\
(T, S, M, Msb:) but some assert that دَانَ and<br>\
أُدِينَ [mentioned in the first paragraph of this art.]<br>\
are derived from it. (S.) ―<br>\
-b14-  The dim. of دُونَ is<br>\
↓ دُوَيْنَ: (Ham p. 404:) and ↓ دُوَيْنَةَ occurs as a<br>\
dim. in a verse of a post-classical poet; but, [ISd<br>\
says,] of what word I know not, unless they said<br>\
↓ دُونَةَ [for دُونَ]. (M.)<br>\
دُونَةَ: see the next preceding sentence.<br>\
دُوَيْنَ: see the next preceding sentence.<br>\
دُوَيْنَةَ: see the next preceding sentence.<br>\
دَيْوَانٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
دِيوَانٌ, an arabicized word, (AO, M, Msb, &amp;c.,)<br>\
from the Pers. [دِيوَانْ]; (AO, M, &amp;c.;) [though<br>\
some hold it to be of Arabic origin:] J says,<br>\
(TA,) it is originally دِوَّانٌ, but ى is substituted<br>\
for one of the و s ; as is shown by its pl., (S, Msb,)<br>\
which is دَوَاوِينُ; (S, M, Msb, K;) for if the ى<br>\
were radical, they would say دَيَاوِينُ; (S;) but<br>\
accord. to IDrd and IJ, (IB, TA,) it has this<br>\
latter pl. also: (M, IB, K, TA:) Sb says that the<br>\
و in دِيوَانٌ, though after ى, is not changed into<br>\
ى, as it is in سَيِّدٌ, because the ى in the former<br>\
word is not inherent; that word being of the<br>\
measure فِعَّالٌ, from دَوَّنْتَ; (M;) [i. e.] it is from<br>\
دَوَّنَ الكُتُبَ meaning “ he collected the writings; ”<br>\
as is shown by their saying ↓ دُوَيْوِينٌ, (M,) which<br>\
is the dim.: (Msb:) ISk says that ديوان is with<br>\
kesr only [to the د]; (M;) but one says ↓ دَيْوَانٌ<br>\
also, (K,) which is mentioned by Ks, as postclassical, and by Sb; like بَيْطَارٌ: (M:) the meaning<br>\
is A دَفْتَر [or register]: (Shifá el-Ghaleel, TA:)<br>\
or a collection of written leaves or papers [forming<br>\
a book, generally for registration]: (ISk, M,<br>\
Mgh, * K:) or a register of accounts; an accountbook: (Msb:) and a register of soldiers and<br>\
pensioners [and others]: (IAth, K:) the first who<br>\
instituted, or appointed, or arranged, such a book,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K,) among the Arabs, (Msb,) for the<br>\
prefects, or administrators, (Mgh, Msb,) and the<br>\
Kádees, (Mgh,) is said to have been &#39;Omar:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K: *) accord. to El-Máwardee, it is<br>\
a register of what concerns the rights, or dues, of<br>\
the state, relating to the acts of the government,<br>\
and the finances, and the military and other<br>\
administrators thereof: (TA:) then any book<br>\
was thus called: and especially the poetry of some<br>\
particular poet: so that this meaning became<br>\
[conventionally regarded as] a proper signification<br>\
thereof; (Shifá el-Ghaleel, TA;) i. e. a collection<br>\
of poetry [of a particular poet]. (TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
one says, فُلَانٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ الدِّيوَانِ, meaning Such a<br>\
one is of those whose names are written in the<br>\
register. (Mgh.) [Also Such a one is of the<br>\
keepers of the register; or, is of the registrars.<br>\
(And sometimes it has another meaning, which<br>\
see below.) And hence the saying] الشِّعْرُ دِيوَانُ<br>\
العَرَبِ (assumed tropical:)  [Poetry is the register of the Arabs]:<br>\
because they used to refer to it on their differing<br>\
in opinion respecting genealogies and wars or<br>\
fights and the appointing of stipends or allowances<br>\
from the government-treasury, like as the people<br>\
of the ديوان [properly so called] refer to their<br>\
ديوان in a case that is doubtful to them; or<br>\
because it was the depository of their sciences,<br>\
and the preserver of their rules of discipline, and<br>\
the mine of their histories. (Har p. 263.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Afterwards, also, it was applied to signify An<br>\
account, or a reckoning. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
Writers [of accounts or reckonings]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And A place of account or reckoning, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) and of writers [of accounts or reckonings]<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Also A council, court, or tribunal:<br>\
see دَسْتٌ. Hence أَهْلُ الدِّيوَانِ sometimes means<br>\
The people of the council, court, or tribunal.<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And also, in the present day, A long seat,<br>\
formed of a mattress laid against the side of a<br>\
room, upon the floor or upon a raised structure<br>\
or frame, with cushions to lean against; or two<br>\
or more of such mattresses &amp;c. similarly placed.]<br>\
ديوَانِىٌّ Of, or belonging to, a دِيوَان. (TA.)<br>\
دُوَيْوِينٌ dim. of دِيوَانٌ, q. v. (M, * Msb.)<br>\
أَدْوَنُ is used by IJ in the phrase ذٰلِكَ أَقَلٌّ<br>\
الأَمْرَيْنِ وَأَدْوَنُهُمَا [That is the lesser of the two<br>\
affairs, or cases, and the lower, baser, &amp;c., of<br>\
them]: but [ISd says that] this is strange, because<br>\
[he held that], like أَحْنَكَ, it has no verb belonging to it. (M.)<br>\
