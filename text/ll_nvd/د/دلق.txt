دَلَقٌ, a Persian word (S, Msb) arabicized, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) originally دَلَهٌ; (Msb, K;) [A species<br>\
of weasel; accord. to some, app., the common<br>\
weasel;] a certain small beast (دُوَيْبَّةٌ, S, Msb, K)<br>\
like the سَمُّور [or sable], (K,) or like the cat,<br>\
having a long back, [of the coat] of which are<br>\
made fur garments: some say that it is the [animal<br>\
called] اِبْن مِقْرَض [q. v.; and this is agreeable<br>\
with the description of Kzw, who says that it is<br>\
“ a certain wild animal, an enemy to pigeons,<br>\
likened to the cat, which, when it enters a pigeonhouse, leaves not in it anything, and abundant in<br>\
Egypt; ” a description altogether applicable to<br>\
the common weasel, now generally called اِبْن<br>\
نِمْس]: some say that it resembles the عِرْس [or<br>\
ichneumon]: some, that it is the Greek ichneumon (نِمْس رُومِىّ): (Msb in the present art.:)<br>\
accord. to IF, the [common] نِمْس. (Msb in art.<br>\
نمس.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also, from the same Persian original,<br>\
in post-classical times, but variously pronounced<br>\
by moderns, دَلَقٌ and ↓ دَلِقٌ and دَلْقٌ and (now<br>\
generally by the vulgar) دِلْقٌ; the third being<br>\
perhaps a contraction of the first, like as شَعْرٌ is<br>\
of شَعَرٌ, or, as also the fourth, of the second, like<br>\
as كَتْفٌ and كِتْفٌ are contractions of كَتِفٌ;<br>\
A certain kind of garment; first probably applied<br>\
to one made of the fur of the animal so called:<br>\
then applied to a kind of garment formerly worn<br>\
by the kádees and other &#39;ulamà and the khateebs<br>\
of mosques, (see De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Ar., 2nd ed.,<br>\
vol. ii. pp. 267-269,) and by other persons of<br>\
religious orders: and lastly, to a kind of patched<br>\
garment worn by many devotees, reputed saints,<br>\
and darweeshes; also called مُرَقَّعَةٌ (q. v.) and<br>\
خِرْقَةٌ. It occurs in a piece of post-classical poetry,<br>\
quoted in p. 45 of the Arabic text of the vol. of<br>\
the Chrest. above referred to, necessarily with the<br>\
ل quiescent; probably by poetic license, or in<br>\
conformity with the common vulgar pronunciation.]<br>\

(S,) and ↓ دِلْقَمٌ, (TA,) A she-camel having her<br>\
teeth broken by old age (S, K) so that she spirts<br>\

cited by Yaakoob, says,<br>\
لَا سِنَّ لَهَا ↓ شَارِفٌ دَلْقَآءُ<br>\
تَحْمِلُ الأَعْبَآءَ مِنْ عَهْدِ إِرَمْ<br>\

age so that water falls from her mouth when she<br>\
drinks, having no tooth left, carrying burdens<br>\
from the time of Irem, i. e. Aram the son of Shem<br>\
the son of Noah]: and ↓ شَارِفٌ دَلْقَآءُ occurs in a<br>\
trad. as meaning having the teeth broken so that<br>\
water falls from her mouth when she drinks:<br>\
(TA:) [but] AZ says that one applies to the she-camel, after what is termed بُزُولٌ, the epithet<br>\
شَارِفٌ; then, عَوْزَمْ; then, لِطْلِطٌ then, جَحْمَرِشٌ;<br>\
then, جَعْمَآءُ; and then, ↓دِلْقِمٌ, when having her<br>\
teeth (أَضْرَاس) fallen out by reason of extreme old<br>\
