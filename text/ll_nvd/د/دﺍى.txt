دَأَى, and دَأَا, aor. يَدْأَى, (T, M, K,) inf. n.<br>\
دَأْىٌ, (T, M,) of the former verb, (M,) and دَأْوٌ,<br>\
(T, K,) of the latter verb, (K,) said of a wolf,<br>\
(M, K,) [and of a man, as shown below,] He<br>\
deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or outwitted, him. (T, M, K.) You say, دَأَيْتُ لَهُ, (S,<br>\
K,) aor. أَدْأَىْ لَهُ, inf. n. دَأْىٌ, I deceived, deluded,<br>\
&amp;c., it, namely, a thing, (S, K,) or him, namely,<br>\
a man; (so in one of my copies of the S;) and<br>\
so دَأَوْتُ لَهُ. (S, M.) And الذِّئْبُ يَدْأَى لِلْغَزَالِ<br>\
The wolf deceives, deludes, &amp;c., the gazelle, or the<br>\
young gazelle: (S, M:) or walks, or goes, in the<br>\
manner of him who deceives, deludes, &amp;c., to the<br>\

دَأْىٌ and ↓ دِئِىٌّ and ↓ دُئِىٌّ, (M, K,) the last<br>\
said by IB, on the authority of As, to be pl. of<br>\
[the n. un.] ↓ دَأْيَةٌ, of the measure فُعُولٌ, [originally دُؤُوىٌ,] (TA,) The vertebræ of the كَاهِل<br>\
[or withers (app. of a camel)] and of the back:<br>\
or the cartilages of the breast: or the ribs thereof,<br>\
where it meets the side: (M, K:) or ↓ الدَّأَيَاتُ<br>\
signifies the ribs of [i. e. within] the shoulderblade, three on either side; (IAar, M, K;) sing.<br>\
↓ دَأْيَةٌ: (M:) or ↓ دَأْيَةٌ, (T,) or دَأْىٌ, (S,) signifies the part of the camel against which lies the<br>\
[piece of wood called] ظَلِفَة of the saddle, and which<br>\
is [often] galled thereby: (T, S:) or دَأْىٌ is the<br>\
pl. [or coll. gen. n.] of ↓ دَأْيَةٌ, and signifies the<br>\
vertebræ of the withers, in the part between the<br>\
two shoulder-blades, of the camel, peculiarly;<br>\
(Lth, T;) and the pl. [of دَأْيَةٌ] is ↓ دَأَيَاتٌ: (Lth,<br>\
T, S:) or the دأيات are the vertebræ of the neck:<br>\
or the vertebræ of the spine: (AO, T:) or the<br>\
two ribs next to the وَاهِنَتَانِ are called the دَأْيَتَانِ:<br>\
AZ says that the Arabs knew not the term دأيات<br>\
in relation to the neck, but they knew it in relation to the ribs, as signifying six [ribs] next to<br>\
the stabbing-place of the camel, three on either<br>\
side; and this is correct: (T:) [and it is said in<br>\
the L, in art. جنح, that دَأْىٌ signifies the ribs of<br>\
the back, of a man, which are called the جَوَانِح,<br>\
pl. of جَانِحَةٌ, six in number, three on the right<br>\
and three on the left:] the pl. of دَأْىٌ [or rather<br>\
the quasi-pl. n.] is دَئِىٌّ, like as ضَئِينٌ is of ضَأْنٌ,<br>\
and مَعِيزٌ of مَعْزٌ: (S:) and, accord. to IB, دُئِىٌّ<br>\
is a pl. of ↓ دَأْيَةٌ, as mentioned above, meaning<br>\
the vertebræ of the neck. (TA.)<br>\
دَأْيَةٌ; and its pls. دَأَيَاتٌ and دُئِىٌّ: see the next<br>\
preceding paragraph, in seven places. ―<br>\

(S,) اِبْنُ دَأْيَةَ The غُرَاب [or crow]: (S, M, K:)<br>\

دأية of the camel that has galls, or sores. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The part, of a bow, upon which the<br>\
arrow lies: there are two parts of which each is<br>\
