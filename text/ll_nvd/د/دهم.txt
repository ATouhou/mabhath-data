Ibn-Ez-Zebbán Edh-Dhuhlee, who was slain,<br>\
with his brothers, and their heads were put upon<br>\
her, (S, K, TA,) in sacks hung upon her neck,<br>\

K, TA:) or, as some say, seven brothers were<br>\
slain in a warring and plundering expedition, and<br>\

K;) when of a deeper hue, so as to be very black,<br>\
he is termed جَوْنٌ: (S:) or, as some say, applied<br>\
to a camel, like أَصْفَرُ, [in this case meaning black<br>\
with some intermixture of yellow,] but less black:<br>\
(TA:) fem. دَهْمَآءُ; which, when applied to a<br>\

of a pure or an unmixed brown colour (خَالِصَةُ<br>\
الحُمْرَةِ): (S, M, Msb, K:) pl. دُهْمٌ. (TA.) The<br>\

in the Kur [lv. 64], (S, TA,) [Two gardens<br>\
(جَنَّتَانِ)] of which the greenness inclines to blackness; for every green plant, when its abundance<br>\
and its moisture, or irrigation, are complete,<br>\
inclines to blackness: (Zj, TA:) or black by<br>\
reason of intense greenness arising from abundant<br>\
moisture, or irrigation; and everything that is<br>\

A, K:) or the black cooking-pot: (ISh, TA:) and<br>\
the old cooking-pot. (K. [But it is implied in the<br>\
TA that this last meaning is a mistake, occasioned<br>\
by an omission; and that, instead of القِدْرُ وَالقَدِيمَةُ,<br>\
(in the CK القِدْرُ القَدِيمَةُ,) we should read,<br>\
القِدْرُ وَالوَطْأَةُ الدَّهْمَآءُ القَدِيمَةُ, explained above.<br>\
Accord. to Golius, on the authority of a gloss in<br>\
