دَبَجَ, aor.<br>\
دَبُجَ [or<br>\
دَبِجَ, as will be shown below],<br>\
(L,) inf. n. دَبْجٌ, (L, K,) [not دَبَجٌ and دَبَجَةٌ as<br>\
in the Lexicons of Golius and Freytag,] He<br>\
variegated, decorated, embellished, adorned, or<br>\
ornamented: (L, K: *) [and so ↓ دبّج, inf. n.<br>\
تَدْبِيجٌ, occurring in the TA in art. نمش; but<br>\
app. in an intensive sense.] And [hence,] دَبَجَ<br>\
الأَرْضَ, (A, L, Msb,) aor.<br>\
دَبُجَ (L, A) or<br>\
دَبِجَ, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. as above; (A, L, Msb;) and ↓ دَبَّجَهَا [but<br>\
app. in an intensive sense]; (A;) (tropical:)  It adorned<br>\
the land with meadows, or gardens: (A, L:) or<br>\
it watered the land, and produced various<br>\
flowers. (Msb.) It is a Pers. word, arabicized:<br>\
(L:) or derived from دِيبَاجٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
2<br>\
دَبَّجَ see above, in two places. [Accord. to<br>\
Golius, (for III. is inadvertently put in his Lex.<br>\
for II.,) as on the authority of the S and K, in<br>\
neither of which is the verb mentioned, “Veste<br>\
ديباج alium ornavit. ”]<br>\
مَا بِالدَّارِ دِبِّيجٌ, (ISk, S, A,) or فِى الدَّارِ, (K,)<br>\
(tropical:)  There is not in the house any one: (ISk, S, A,<br>\
K:) دِبِّيجٌ is not used otherwise than in a negative phrase: IJ derives it from دِيبَاجٌ; because<br>\
men adorn the earth: (TA:) [Z says,] it is<br>\
from دَبَجَ, like سِكِّيتٌ from سَكَتَ; because men<br>\
adorn houses: (A:) Abu-l-&#39;Abbás says that<br>\
دِبِّيحٌ is more chaste than دِبِّيجٌ: (TA:) [ISk<br>\
says, or J, for the passage is ambiguous,]<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd doubted respecting the ج and the ح;<br>\
and I asked respecting this word, in the desert,<br>\
a company of the Arabs thereof, and they said,<br>\
مَا فِى الدَّارِ دِبِّىٌّ, and nothing more; but I have<br>\
found in the handwriting of Aboo-Moosà El-<br>\
Hámid, ما فى الدار دِبِّيجٌ, with ج, on the authority of Th: (S:) AM says that the ج in دِبِّيٌج<br>\
is substituted for the [latter] ى in دِبِّىٌّ, in like<br>\
manner as they say مُرِّىٌّ and مُرِّجٌّ &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
دُبَيْبِيجٌ: see the next paragraph, near the<br>\
end.<br>\
دِيبَاجٌ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) or دَيْبَاجٌ,<br>\
(Th,) or both, (IAar, A&#39;Obeyd,) the latter<br>\
having been sometimes heard, (IAar,) or the<br>\
latter is post-classical, (A&#39;Obeyd,) or wrong,<br>\
(AZ,) a word of well-known meaning, (K,)<br>\
[Silk brocade;] a certain kind of cloth, or garment, made of إِبْرِيسَم [i. e. silk, or raw silk]:<br>\

warp and woof are both of ابريسم: and particularly a name for that which is variegated,<br>\
decorated, or embellished: (Mgh, Msb:) a kind<br>\
of woven stuff, variegated, or diversified, with<br>\
colours: (Lb, TA:) [accord. to Golius, as on<br>\
the authority of the S and K, in neither of<br>\
which is the word explained at all, “vestis<br>\
serica: imprimis picta, pec. Attalica, auro intexta:] derived from دَبَجَ: (Ks:) or it is a<br>\
Pers. word, (Kr, S, A,) arabicized; (Kr, S, A,<br>\
Msb, K;) so some say, and from it دَبَجَ is<br>\
derived; (Msb;) originally دِيبَاىْ, or دِيبَا;<br>\
(Kr;) [or rather دِيبَاهْ, for the change of the<br>\
final ه into ج in arabicized words from the Pers.<br>\
is very common;] or دِيوْ بَافْ, i. e. “ the weaving<br>\
of the deevs, or jinn, or genii: ” (Shifá el-Ghaleel:)<br>\
pl. دَيَابِيجُ and دَبَابِيجُ; (S, Msb, K;) the latter<br>\
being from the supposed original form of the<br>\
sing., i. e. دِبَّاجٌ; (S, Msb;) like دَنَانِيرُ [pl. of<br>\
دِينَارٌ, which is supposed to be originally دِنَّارٌ]:<br>\
and in like manner is formed the dim. [↓ دُيَيْبِيجٌ<br>\
and ↓ دُبَيْبِيجٌ]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  دِيبَاجُ القُرْآنِ is a title<br>\
given by Ibn-Mes&#39;ood to The chapters of the<br>\
Kur-án called الحَوَامِيمُ [the fortieth and six<br>\

the letters حٰم]. (TA.) ―<br>\

the two sides of the neck, beneath the ears; syn.<br>\
اللِّيتَانِ. (TA.) You say, فُلَانٌ يَصُونُ دِيبَاجَتَيْهِ,<br>\
i. e. (tropical:)  [Such a one preserves from disgrace] his<br>\
cheeks; (A;) or دِيبَاجَتَهُ his face: and يَبْذُلُ<br>\

1 (near the end) in the same art.; where similar<br>\
exs. are given.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Golius, after mentioning<br>\
the signification of “ the two cheeks,” adds, as<br>\
on the authority of the K, in which even the<br>\
word itself is not mentioned, “et quibusdam<br>\
quoque Nates. ”] ―<br>\
