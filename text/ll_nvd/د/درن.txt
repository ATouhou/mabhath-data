دَرِنَ, aor.<br>\
دَرَنَ, inf. n. دَرَنٌ; (T, * S, * M, Msb,<br>\
K; *) and ↓ ادرن; (T, M, K;) It (a garment,<br>\
S, M, &amp;c.) was, or became, dirty, or filthy: (S,<br>\
M, Msb, K:) or was, or became, defiled, polluted, or smeared, with dirt, or filth. (T, K.)<br>\

or filth: (T, K:) and accord. to the K, ↓ الإِدْرَوْنٌ<br>\
also is syn. with الدَّرَنُ; but ISd says that this is<br>\
not known. (So in the TA. [In the text of the<br>\
M, however, as given in the TT, in the place of<br>\
الدَّرَنُ in this case I find الرَدِى (for الرَّدِىْءُ, i. e.<br>\
the bad, &amp;c.); and another passage in the M,<br>\
respecting a signification of إِدْرَوْنٌ, (which see<br>\
below,) suggests that the explanation of الإِدْرَوْنُ<br>\
as meaning الدَّرَنُ may have been taken from this<br>\
passage in consequence of an oversight.]) مَاكَانَ<br>\
إِلَّا كَدَرَنٍ بِكَفِّى, meaning It was no otherwise<br>\
than like dirt in my hand, which I therefore<br>\
wiped with the other hand, is a prov. applied in<br>\
