load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'دهدردُهْدُرٌّ a noun signifying What is false, or vain;<br>\
a lie; syn. بَاطِلٌ and كَذِبٌ: as also دُهْدُرَّيْنِ,<br>\
(K,) its dual, (TA,) or دُهْ دُرَّيْنِ, or دُهْ دُرَّيْنْ: (as<br>\
in different copies of the S:) whence دُهْدُرَّيْنِ<br>\
and ↓ دُهْدُرِّيَّةٌ are epithets applied to a liar; or a<br>\
great or habitual liar: and accord. to AZ, the<br>\
Arabs used to say, دُهْدُرَّانِ لَا يُغْنِياَنِ عَنْكَ شَيْئًا<br>\
[Lies will not avail thee aught]: and دُهْدُنٌّ signifies the same as دُهْدُرٌّ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  دُهْدُرَّيْنِ is also<br>\
a noun, (K,) i. e. a verbal noun, (TA,) signifying He was, or has become, unoccupied, or without work; syn. بَطَلَ; (K;) like سَرْعَانَ for سَرُعَ,<br>\
and هَيْهَاتِ for بَعُدَ. (TA.) Hence the prov.,<br>\
(TA,) دُهْدُرَّيْنِ سَعْدُ القَيْنِ, (As, K,) without the<br>\
conjunction وَ [after the first word], and دهدرّين<br>\
being written as one word, (TA,) meaning Saad<br>\
the blacksmith became, or has become, unoccupied, or without work; not being employed<br>\
because of the people&#39;s being diverted from other<br>\
things by drought (As, K) and distress. (TA.)<br>\
Some say سَاعدُ القَيْنِ: and Aboo-&#39;Obeydeh<br>\
Maamar Ibn-El-Muthennà relates it thus: دهدرّين<br>\
سَعْدَ القَيْن, with سعد in the accus. case, and says<br>\
that دهدرّين is governed in the accus. case by a<br>\
verb understood; apparently meaning that it is a<br>\
noun signifying البَاطِلُ, dual of دُهْدُرٌّ, not a verbal<br>\
noun, as though the prov. meant Cast ye away<br>\
what is false, or vain, and Saad the blacksmith:<br>\
but what he says is not correct. (TA.) Or a<br>\
certain blacksmith asserted his name to be Saad<br>\
for some time, and then his lying became manifest; so this was said to him; meaning, Thou<br>\
hast added falsehood to falsehood, O Saad the<br>\
blacksmith. (K.) It is also related separately;<br>\
(K;) and so J and others relate it; saying ده<br>\
درّين: (TA:) [in one copy of the S, I find it<br>\
written دُهْ دُرَّيْنْ: in another, دُهْ دُرَّيْنِ:] دُهْ being<br>\
an imperative from الدَّهَآءُ; its final radical letter<br>\
being transposed to the place of the medial, so<br>\
that it becomes دُوْهْ, and the و being then rejected<br>\
because of the two quiescent letters, (K,) so<br>\
that it becomes دُهْ, like as is done in the case of<br>\
قُلْ: (TA:) and دُرَّيْنِ being from دَرَّ, “it was<br>\
consecutive; ” (K;) by the dual form being<br>\
meant repetition, as in the case of لَبَّيْكَ &amp;c.:<br>\
(TA:) so that the meaning is Be thou very<br>\
lying (K) and cunning, (TA,) O Saad (K) the<br>\
blacksmith: (TA:) and this explanation, says<br>\
IB, is good, except inasmuch as that the د in<br>\
درّين thus derived should be with fet-h; or, he<br>\
adds, it may be with damm to assimilate it to the<br>\
د in دُهْ [like as القَيْنِ is terminated with kesr to<br>\
assimilate it to دُرَّيْنِ]. (TA.) Or the origin of<br>\
the saying was this: Saad the blacksmith was a<br>\
Persian, who went about the districts of ElYemen, working for the people; and when he<br>\
became without work in a district, he used to<br>\
say, in Persian, دِهْ بَدْرُودْ: [so in a copy of the<br>\
S; and this, or دِهْ بِدْرُودْ, is the correct reading:<br>\
in another copy of the S, دَهْ بَدُورُدْ: and in the<br>\
copies of the K, دِهْ بَدْرُودْ:] (S, K:*) meaning,<br>\
[O town, or village,] farewell: to acquaint them<br>\
that he was going forth on the morrow: (K:)<br>\
or meaning I am going forth to-morrow: (S:)<br>\
in order that he might be employed: and they<br>\
arabicized the expression, and made him the<br>\
subject of a prov. with respect to lying; and said,<br>\
When ye hear of the blacksmith&#39;s departure at<br>\
night, he is assuredly coming in the morning.<br>\
(S, K.) Some say that the prov. is elliptical, for<br>\
بَطَلَ قَوْلُ سَعْدٍ الخ [False is the saying of Saad<br>\
&amp;c.]. (TA.) [This is mentioned in the S in<br>\
art. در.]<br>\
دُهْدُرَّيَّةٌ: see above, first sentence.<br>\
