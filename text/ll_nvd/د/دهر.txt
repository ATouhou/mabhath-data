دَهَرَهُمْ أَمْرٌ, (JK, A, K,) and دَهَرَ بِهِمْ أَمْرٌ, (S,<br>\
TA,) aor.<br>\
دَهَرَ, (K,) An event befell them (S, A)<br>\
from fate, or fortune: (A:) or an evil event<br>\
befell them. (JK, K.) In a trad. respecting the<br>\
death of Aboo-Tálib occur these words [as said<br>\
by him]: لَوْ لَا أَنًّ قُرَيْشًا تَقُولُ دَهَرَهُ الجَزَعُ لَفَعَلْتُ<br>\
[Were it not that the tribe of Kureysh would say,<br>\
Impatience hath befallen him, (or, perhaps, constrained him, from دَهْرٌ signifying “fate,” or<br>\
overcome him, see what follows,) I would do<br>\
it]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  دَهَرَهُ, (Bd in xlv. 23,) inf. n. دَهْرٌ,<br>\
(K,) He overcame, conquered, subdued, overpowered, or mastered, him; gained the mastery,<br>\
prevailed, or predominated, over him; or surpassed him. (Bd ubi suprà, B, * K.)<br>\
3<br>\
عَامَلَهُ مُدَاهَرَةٌ and<br>\
دِهَارًا is like مُشَاهَرَةً [i. e. it<br>\
means He made an engagement, or a contract, or<br>\
bargain, with him to work, or the like, for a long<br>\
period, or for a constancy; like as مُشَاهَرَةً means<br>\
“for a month”]. (K.) And in like manner one<br>\
says, اِسْتَأْجَرَهُ مُدَاهَرَةً and دِهَارًا [He hired him for<br>\
a long period, or for a constancy]. (Lh, TA.)<br>\
Q. Q. 1<br>\
دَهْوَرَهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. دَهْوَرَةٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He collected it together, and threw it into a deep<br>\
place. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He pushed it, namely, a wall,<br>\
so that it fell. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  دهوراللُّقَمَ He made the<br>\
mouthfuls large, (S, A,) or round, (Az,) and<br>\
gulped them down. (Az, A.)<br>\
Q. Q. 2<br>\
تَدَهْوَرَ It (sand) poured down, and<br>\
for the most part fell. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,<br>\
He, or it, fell down, from a higher to a lower<br>\
place. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And It (the night) for the<br>\
most part went: (Msb:) or departed, or retreated. (K, TA.)<br>\
دَهْرٌ (T, S, M, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ دَهَرٌ, (M, K,) the<br>\
latter either a dial. var., agreeably with the<br>\
opinion of the Basrees in cases of this kind, and<br>\
therefore such cases are limited by the authority<br>\
of hearsay, or it is so written and pronounced<br>\
because of the guttural letter, and so is accordant<br>\
to a universal rule, agreeably with the opinion of<br>\
the Koofees, (ISd,) Time, from the beginning of<br>\
the world to its end; (Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, Az, Msb, Er-Rághib;) as also حِينٌ: (Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, Az:)<br>\
this is the primary signification: (Er-Rághib:)<br>\
and any long period of time; (Z, Mgh, K, Er-Rághib;) thus differing from زَمَانٌ, which will<br>\
be explained below: (Er-Rághib:) and a portion<br>\
of the longest period of time: (Az:) or دَهْرٌ signifies, (S, A,) or signifies also, (Az, Msb,) time;<br>\
or a time; or a space, or period, of time; syn.<br>\
زَمَانٌ, (Sh, Az, S, A, Mgh, Msb,) whether long or<br>\
short: (Msb:) or this is the proper signification<br>\
of زَمَانٌ, but not of دَهْرٌ: (Er-Rághib:) and (tropical:)  a<br>\
division of the year: and (tropical:)  a less period: (Az,<br>\
Msb:) Az says, I have heard more than one of<br>\
the Arabs say, أَقَمْنَا عَلَى مَآءِ كَذَا دَهْرًا [We<br>\
stayed at such a water a long time, or a time];<br>\
and هٰذَا المَرْعَى يَكْفِينَا دَهْرًا [This pasture-land<br>\
will suffice us a long time, or a time]; but one<br>\
does not say that الدَّهْرُ is four times, or four<br>\
seasons, because its application to (tropical:)  a short period<br>\
of time is tropical, and an extension of its proper<br>\
signification: (Msb:) or it signifies i. q. أَبَدٌ<br>\
[meaning a long unlimited time; or an extended<br>\
indivisible space of time; or duration without<br>\
end; time without end]; (S, Msb;) it differs<br>\
from زَمَانٌ in having no end: (Khálid Ibn-Yezeed:) or a prolonged, or lengthened, term;<br>\
syn. أَبَدٌ مَمْدُودٌ: (K, in some copies of which, in<br>\
the place of ابد, we find أَمَد:) and (tropical:)  the period,<br>\
or duration, of life; an age: (Kull p. 183:) the<br>\
present state of existence: (Msb:) and (assumed tropical:)  a thousand years: (K:) pl. [of pauc.] أَدْهُرٌ (K) and<br>\
[of mult.] دُهُورٌ: (S, A, K:) both said to be pls.<br>\
of دَهْرٌ, and no other pls. are known as those of<br>\
دَهَرٌ; the form أَدْهَارٌ not having been heard.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say مَضَى عَلَيْهِ دَهْرٌ and دُهُورٌ [A<br>\
long time and long times, or an age and ages, &amp;c.,<br>\
passed over him, or it]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And كَانَ ذٰلِكَ<br>\
دَهْرَ النَّجْمِ That was in the time of God&#39;s creation<br>\
of the stars; meaning, in the beginning of time;<br>\
in ancient time. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And فِى أَوَّلِ الدَّهْرِ In<br>\
the beginning of time. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [And يَبْقَى الدَّهْرَ It<br>\
remains for ever. ―<br>\
-b6-  And لَا آتِيهِ الدَّهْرَ I will not<br>\
come to him, ever. See also دَاهِرٌ.] ―<br>\
-b7-  And صَامَ<br>\
الدَّهْرَ [He fasted ever, or always]. (TA in art.<br>\
اول, &amp;c. [See a trad. cited voce آلَ, in that<br>\
art.]) ―<br>\
-b8-  [Hence, because, in one sense, time<br>\
brings to pass events, good and evil,] الدَّهْرُ was<br>\
applied by the Arabs to Fortune; or fate: and<br>\
they used to blame and revile it: and as the<br>\
doing so was virtually blaming and reviling<br>\
God, since events are really brought to pass by<br>\
Him, Mohammad forbade their doing thus. (Az,<br>\
Mgh, TA, &amp;c.) It is said in a trad., لَا تَسُبُّوا الدَّهْرَ<br>\
فَإِنَّ الدَّهْرَ هُوَ اللّٰهُ, (S, Mgh, TA, &amp;c.,) or, accord.<br>\
to one reading, فَإِنَّ اللّٰهُ هُوَ الدَّهْرُ, (Az, Mgh, TA,<br>\
&amp;c.,) in which some explain الدهر in the first<br>\
proposition as having a different meaning from<br>\
that which it has in the second, whereas others<br>\
assign to it the same meaning in both cases:<br>\
(TA:) the meaning of the trad. is, Revile ye not<br>\
[fortune, or] the Efficient of fortune; for the<br>\
Efficient of fortune is God: (Az, S, TA, &amp;c.:)<br>\
or, accord. to the second reading, for God is the<br>\
Efficient of fortune. (TA.) Hence, (TA,) some<br>\
reckon الدَّهْرُ as one of the names of God: (K,<br>\
&amp;c.:) but some disallow this: and some say that<br>\
it is allowable if meant to signify, as rendered<br>\
above, the Efficient of fortune. (TA, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
زَوْجُ دَهْرٍ A husband prepared for the accidents or<br>\
calamities of fortune. (S in art. بهر. [See بَهْرٌ.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b10-  دَهْرٌ also signifies An evil event or accident;<br>\
a misfortune; a calamity. (K.) See also دَهَارِيرُ.<br>\
[And see 1.] ―<br>\
-b11-  Also A purpose; an intention:<br>\
(S, K:) a desire: (TA:) the scope, or end that<br>\
one has in view. (K, TA.) You say, مَا دَهْرِى<br>\
بِكَذَا, (S, TA,) and مَا دَهْرِى كَذَا, (TA,) My purpose, or intention, (S, TA,) and my desire, and my<br>\
scope, or the end that I have in view, (TA,) is<br>\
not such a thing. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-  Also (tropical:)  A custom,<br>\
or habit, (S, K,) that is constant, or permanent,<br>\
(Kull p. 183,) or that lasts throughout life.<br>\
(TA.) You say, مَا ذَاكَ بِدَهْرِى (tropical:)  That is not my<br>\
custom, or habit, (S,) that lasts throughout my<br>\
life: (TA:) and مَا دَهْرِى بِكَذَا (tropical:)  My habit<br>\
throughout life is not so. (TA.)<br>\
دَهَرٌ: see دَهْرٌ.<br>\
دَهْرِىٌّ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ دُهْرِىٌّ (K) One<br>\
who deviates from the truth, and introduces into<br>\
it that which does not belong to it, syn. مُلْحِدٌ;<br>\
(S, A;) who asserts that the duration of the<br>\
present world is from eternity, (A, Msb,) or that<br>\
it is everlasting, (K,) and does not believe in the<br>\
resurrection, (Msb,) or in the world to come.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And the latter, (S, A, Msb, K,) or the<br>\
former, (IAmb,) An old, or aged, man. (IAmb,<br>\
S, A, Msb, K.) Th says that both are rel. ns.<br>\
from الدَّهْرُ, though the latter is contr. to rule, [as<br>\
is also remarked in the Msb,] like سُهْلِىٌّ from<br>\
الأَرْضُ السَّهْلَةُ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Some say also that the<br>\
latter signifies An acute, or ingenious, or expert,<br>\
man. (TA.)<br>\
دُهْرِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
دِهْرَارٌ: see دَهَارِيرُ.<br>\
دُهرُورٌ: see دَهَارِيرُ.<br>\
دِهْرِيرٌ: see دَهَارِيرُ.<br>\
دَهيِرٌ: see دَاهِرٌ.<br>\
دَهَارِيرُ, a pl. without a sing.; (K, TA;) or its<br>\
sing. is ↓ دَهْرٌ, like as the sing. of مَذَاكِيرُ is ذَكَرٌ,<br>\
and that of مَشَابِهُ, شَبَهٌ; or its sing. is ↓ دُهْرُورٌ, or<br>\
↓ دِهْرَارٌ, [in the TA written by mistake دهرات,]<br>\
or ↓ دِهْرِيرٌ; (TA;) Misfortunes; calamities: as<br>\
in the phrase وَقَعَ فِى الدَّهَارِيرِ He fell into misfortunes, or calamities. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Severe,<br>\
or calamitous. (S.) It is said in a trad. of Sateeh,<br>\
فَإِنَّ ذَا الدَّهْرَ أَطْوَارًا دَهَارِيرُ<br>\
[For verily this age is at times calamitous].<br>\
(TA.) دَهْرٌ دَهَارِيرُ, A severe, or calamitous, age,<br>\
is a phrase like لَيْلَةُ لَيْلَآءُ, and نَهَارٌ أَنْهَرُ, &amp;c.: (S:)<br>\
[see also دَاهِرٌ:] and it also signifies a time of<br>\
two states, adverse and prosperous: (TA:) and<br>\
دُهُورٌ دَهَارِيرٌ, various, or varying, times: (K:) or<br>\
long times. (A.) [See دَاهِرٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also دَهَارِيرُ [or<br>\
rather, as IbrD says, دَهْرُ الدَّهَارِيرِ, for this has the<br>\
signification immediately following,] The beginning of time past: and [absolutely] preceding,<br>\
or past, time. (K, TA.) You say كَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى<br>\
دَهْرِ الدَّهَارِيرِ [That was in the beginning of past<br>\
time: or in the time of by-gone ages]. (TA.)<br>\
دَهْرٌ دَاهِرٌ (S, K) and ↓ دَهْرٌ دَهِيرٌ (K) are phrases<br>\
in which the epithet has an intensive effect,<br>\
[meaning A long, or an endless, period, or course,<br>\
of time,] (K,) like أَبَدٌ أَبِيدٌ (S, TA) and أَبَدٌ آبِدٌ:<br>\
(TA:) or a severe, or calamitous, age. (TA.)<br>\
[See also دَهَارِيرُ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  لَا آتِيكَ دَهْرَ الدَّهِرِينَ I will<br>\
not come to thee, ever: (S, K:) similar to the<br>\
phrase أَبَدَ الآبِدِينَ. (TA.)<br>\
هُمْ مَدْهُورٌ بِهِمٌ, and مَدْهُورُونَ, They are afflicted<br>\
with an evil event. (K.)<br>\
