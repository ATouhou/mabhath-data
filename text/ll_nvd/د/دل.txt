be rightly directed? but how shall the dull and<br>\
slack be rightly directed?]. (T, M, TA: but in<br>\
the M, يا فُلَانُ; and in the TA, يا أَعْوَرُ.) And<br>\
sometimes ↓ استدلّ is quasi-pass. of دَلَّهُ الطَّرِيقَ<br>\

coquettishness, feigning opposition: (M, Msb,<br>\

certain properties, or peculiar qualities. (IAar,<br>\

accord. to rule, يَدُلُّ,] He emboldened: so in the<br>\
phrase, مَا دَلَّكَ عَلَىَّ [What emboldened thee, or<br>\

(M, Mgh, * K:) and هِىَ تُدِلُّ عَلَيْهِ [and ↓ تَتَدَلَّلُ]<br>\
She emboldens herself against him. (T.) Imrael-Keys says,<br>\
↓ أَفَاطِمَ مَهْلًا بَعْضَ هٰذاَ التَّدَلُّلِ<br>\
فَإِنْ كُنْتِ قَدْ أَزْمَعْتِ صَرْمِى فَأَجْمِلِى<br>\
[O Fátimeh (فاطم being a contraction of فَاطِمَةُ),<br>\
act thou gently: relinquish somewhat of this<br>\
boldness; (or, as is said in the EM, p. 15, of this<br>\
amorous gesture or behaviour, and coquettish<br>\
boldness, and feigned coyness or opposition; see<br>\
1;) and if thou have determined upon cutting<br>\
me, act with goodness, or moderation]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also He confided in his love, and therefore<br>\
acted presumptuously towards him. (IDrd, M,<br>\
K. *) In the copies of the K, أَوْثَقَ is here put<br>\
in the place of وَثِقَ. (TA.) [And in the CK,<br>\
أَوْثَقَ بِحَبَّتِه is put for وَثِقَ بِمُحَبِّتِهِ.] Hence,<br>\
(TA,) one says, أَدَلَّ فَأَمَلَّ [He acted presumptuously, confiding in another&#39;s love, and disgusted]:<br>\
(S, M, TA:) a prov. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  One says<br>\
also, هُوَ يُدِلُّ بِفُلَانٍ, meaning [simply] He confides in such a one. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And ادلّ عَلَى أَقْرَانِهِ,<br>\
(S, M, K,) meaning أَخَذَهُمْ مِنْ فَوْقٍ [i. e. He<br>\
overcame, or overpowered, his adversaries], (M,<br>\
K,) in war, or battle: (S:) and so البَازِى عَلَى<br>\
صَيْدِهِ [the hawk, his prey, or quarry]. (S, M, K.)<br>\
-A3-  ادلّ said of a wolf, He became mangy, or<br>\
scabby, and lean, or emaciated, and small in<br>\
body. (Sgh, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَدَلَّ3َ see 1, and 4; the latter in three places.<br>\
تدلّل also signifies He exalted himself; or was,<br>\
or became, haughty, proud, or disdainful: you<br>\
say, هُمْ يَتَدَلَّلُونَ عَلَى السُّلْطَانِ [They exalt themselves against the Sultán; or behave haughtily<br>\
to him]. (S in art. دكل.)<br>\

استدلّ He desired, or sought, an indication, an evidence, a proof, or an argument: [this<br>\
is the primary signification: and hence,] he<br>\
adduced an indication, &amp;c.: and he drew an inference, or a deduction: (KL:) or he established<br>\
an indication for the purpose of obtaining a<br>\
certain knowledge of a thing indicated, or for<br>\
the purpose of affirming a thing indicated: and<br>\
sometimes it is quasi-pass. of دَلَّهُ الطَّرِيقَ [explained above, so that it signifies he was, or became,<br>\
directed, or rightly directed, to the way]. (TA.<br>\
See 1.) [You say, استدلّ بِشَىْءٍعَلَى شَىْءٍ آخَرَ<br>\
He desired, or sought, to be directed, or guided,<br>\
by a thing, to another thing: he adduced, or<br>\
took, or regarded, a thing as an indication, an<br>\
evidence, or a proof, of another thing, or as an<br>\
argument in favour of another thing: he inferred, from a thing, another thing: he sought,<br>\
or found, or perceived, or saw, in a thing, an indication, an evidence, or a proof, of another<br>\
thing, or an argument in favour of another<br>\
thing: he was, or became, directed, or guided, or<br>\
he directed or guided himself, by a thing, to<br>\
another thing, or to the knowledge of another<br>\
thing. الدَّلِيلُ مَا يُسْتَدَلَّ بِهِ, occurring in the S,<br>\
means The دليل is that whereby one is directed,<br>\
or guided.]<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
دَلْدَلَ, (M,) inf. n. دَلْدَلَةٌ and دِلْدَالٌ,<br>\
(M, K,) He put in motion or in a state of<br>\

of motion or commotion, or it moved about, (T,<br>\
S, K,) hanging down; i. e. it dangled: (S, K:)<br>\
it hung down loosely. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
تَدَلْدَلُوا بَيْنَ أَمْرَيْنِ فَلَمْ يَسْتَقِيمُوا [(assumed tropical:)  They wavered,<br>\
vacillated, or hung in suspense, between two<br>\
affairs, and did not pursue a direct course]. (Lh,<br>\
T, K.)<br>\
دَلٌّ Amorous gesture or behaviour, of a woman,<br>\
with coquettish boldness, and feigned coyness or<br>\
opposition; as also ↓ دَلَالٌ: (S, M:) the former is<br>\
an inf. n., [see 1,] and ↓ the latter is a simple<br>\
subst.; (Msb;) both signifying a woman&#39;s boldness of behaviour (M, Msb, K) towards the<br>\
husband, (M, K,) with amorous gesture, and<br>\
coquettishness, feigning opposition; (M, Msb, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ دَالُولَآءُ, (K,) and ↓ دَالَّةٌ: (Har p. 567:)<br>\
or دَلٌّ signifies a woman&#39;s pleasing talk and<br>\
jesting and mien or guise; as also ↓ دَلَالٌ: (Sh,<br>\
T:) and pleasing talk and jesting of a man with<br>\
his wife: (TA in art. سمت:) and also, (Kudot;,)<br>\
accord. to A&#39;Obeyd (T, S) and Hr, (M,) like<br>\
هَدْىٌ, (K,) or nearly the same as this word,<br>\
(T, S, M,) both signifying a certain calm or<br>\
placid or grave manner of deportment, with<br>\
pleasingness of mien or guise or aspect, (T, S, M,<br>\
K,) and of the natural dispositions &amp;c., (T, S,)<br>\
of a man: (T, S, M:) and boldness [or presumptuousness]; (T in art. دلو;) as also ↓ دَلَالٌ<br>\
and ↓ دَالَّةٌ: (Mgh, and Har p. 243, and T ubi<br>\
suprà in explanation of the last:) or this last<br>\
signifies a kind of boldness (IAar, T, M, * K *)<br>\
towards a person in whose estimation one holds a<br>\
high place, (IAar, T,) or towards a person beloved, or a beloved and loving relation; (M, K;)<br>\
and is a subst. from أَدَلَّ; (S;) syn. with إِدْلَالٌ;<br>\
(Har p. 243;) as is also ↓ دِلَّةٌ. (Fr, T.) One<br>\
says, هِىَ حَسَنَةُ الدَّلِّ and ↓ الدَّلَالِ [She is pleasing<br>\
in respect of her amorous gesture &amp;c.]. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also an arabicized word, from the Pers.<br>\
دِلْ signifying The heart, or mind: (M, K:)<br>\
sometimes used in the speech of the Arabs, (M,)<br>\
and applied by them as a proper name (M, K,)<br>\
to a woman: (M:) with fet-h (M, K) and<br>\
teshdeed (K) because there is no such word in<br>\
their language as دِلٌّ; wherefore they changed it<br>\
to دَلٌّ, which has the first of the meanings assigned<br>\
to it above. (M.)<br>\
[<br>\
دَلَّةٌ, to which Golius assigns a meaning partly<br>\
belonging to دَلْدَلَةٌ, an inf. n. of دَلْدَلَ, and partly<br>\
to other words of this art, (“ Capitis membrorumve motus seu gestus, extrinsecus gravitatem<br>\
præ se ferens, profectus tamen ab eo qui amat<br>\
favetque,”) as on the authority of the K and KL,<br>\
I do not find in either of those works.]<br>\
دُلَّةٌ A favour, or benefit, conferred, or bestowed.<br>\
(Fr, T.)<br>\
دِلَّةٌ: see دَلٌّ.<br>\
دَلَالٌ: see دَلٌّ, in five places.<br>\
دَلِيلٌ i. q. ↓ دَالٌّ; (S, Msb, TA;) i.e.[A director; or] a right director (Msb, Kull, TA) to<br>\
that which is sought or desired; a guide; (Kull;)<br>\
one who directs, or rightly directs, another; (M;)<br>\
[an indicator;] and a discoverer: (Msb:) and<br>\
a thing by which one is directed, or guided,<br>\
(مَا يُسْتَدَلُّ بِهِ S, TA,) or by which one is rightly<br>\
directed; (TA;) [an indication; an evidence; a<br>\
proof; and an argument;] a sign set up for the<br>\
knowledge of a thing indicated; (whence smoke<br>\
is called دَلِيلٌ عَلَى النَّارِ [an indication of fire];)<br>\
anything whereby a thing indicated is known,<br>\
whether relating to an object of sense or to the<br>\
law [&amp;c.], decisive or indecisive: and ↓ دَلَالَةٌ is<br>\
used in the sense of دَلِيلٌ, because a thing is<br>\
called by the inf. n. of its verb: (Kull:) and so is<br>\
↓ دِلِّيلَى, (S, MF, TA,) though this is asserted in<br>\
the K to have been said heedlessly by J because<br>\
this last word is an inf. n.; for the inf. n. is used<br>\
in the sense of the act. part. n., almost by a<br>\
general rule, as it is also in the sense of the pass.<br>\
part. n.: (MF, TA:) the pl. of دَلِيلٌ is أَدِلَّآءُ<br>\
[generally restricted to rational beings, or always<br>\
so restricted,] and أَدِلَّةٌ [generally restricted to<br>\
things by which one is directed &amp;c., but properly<br>\
a pl. of pauc.,] (M, TA) and, accord. to some,<br>\
دَلَائِلُ, (Kull,) or this is pl. of ↓ دَلِيلَةٌ [fem. of<br>\
دَلِيلٌ, or of ↓ دَلَالَةٌ, as is also دَلَالَاتٌ. (TA.)<br>\
يَا دَلِيلَ المُتَحَيِّرِينَ means O guide of those who<br>\
are perplexed to that by means of which their<br>\
perplexity will depart. (Kull.) The saying of a<br>\
poet,<br>\
شَدُّوا المَطَى عَلَى دَلِيلٍ دَائِبِ<br>\
means, as some say, بِدَلِيلٍ [i.e. They bound the<br>\
saddles upon the camels for riding, with, or by<br>\
means of, a toiling guide]: or, accord. to IJ, it<br>\
may be elliptical, for عَلَىدِلَالَةِ دَلِيلٍ, and is like<br>\
the phrase سِرْ عَلَى اسْمِ اللّٰهِ; as though he said,<br>\
مُعْتَمِدِينَ عَلَى دَلِيلٍ دَائِبِ [relying upon a toiling<br>\
guide]. (M.)<br>\
دَلَالَةٌ: see the next paragraph, in four places;<br>\

-b2-  see also دَلِيلٌ, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b3-  As a conventional term, (TA,) it means<br>\
A word&#39;s signification, or indication of meaning:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) this is of three kinds: thus إِنْسَانٌ<br>\
signifies, or indicates, “an animal endowed with<br>\
reason ” بِالمُطَابَقَةِ, i. e. by complete correspondence; and “ an animal ” or “ a being endowed<br>\
with reason ” بِالتَّضَمُّنِ, i. e. [by partial inclusion,<br>\
or] partially; and “ a being capable of knowledge ” بِالِالْتِزَامِ, i. e. [necessarily, or] by a necessary idea attached to it in the mind. (TA.)<br>\
دِلَالَةٌ a subst. signifying Direction, right direction, or guidance; (Fr, T, M, Msb;) as also<br>\
↓ دَلَالَةٌ, (Fr, T, Msb,) or the former only accord.<br>\
to IDrd, (M,) and ↓ دُلُولَةٌ and ↓ دِلِّلَيلَى; (M;) or<br>\
this last is an inf. n. like ↓ دَلَالَةٌ; (K;) or signifies<br>\
the skill of a guide in direction or right direction<br>\
or guidance; his well-grounded skill therein.<br>\
(Sb, M, K.) A poet says,<br>\
إِنِّى امْرَأٌ بِالطُّرْقِ ذُو دَلَالَاتْ<br>\
[Verily I am a man possessing varied skill in<br>\
guiding in the roads, or ways]. (A&#39;Obeyd, S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  The occupation of the دَلَّال [q. v.]; (M, K;)<br>\

دُلُولَةٌ an inf. n. of دَلَّ [q. v.]: (S, Msb, K:) or<br>\
a simple subst.: (M:) see the next preceding<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
دَلِيلَةٌ: see دَليِلٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also what next<br>\
follows.<br>\
دُلَّى A conspicuous road or beaten track.<br>\
(IAar, K.) In the T, at the end of art. لد it is<br>\
said that ↓ دَلِيلَةٌ signifies A white road or beaten<br>\
track; on the authority of AA. (TA.)<br>\
دَلَّالٌ A broker; or one who acts as an intermediary between the seller and the buyer, for effecting<br>\
the sale; because he directs the purchaser to the<br>\
merchandise, and the seller to the price; also<br>\
called سِمْسَارٌ; (TA in art. سمسر;) one who brings<br>\
together the seller and the buyer. (M, K.)<br>\

people, or party, wavering, vacillating, or hanging in suspense, between two affairs, and not<br>\
pursuing a direct course. (Lh, T, K.) You say<br>\
also, جَاوُوا دُلْدُلًا, meaning They came wavering;<br>\
not inclining to these nor to those. (ISk, T, S.)<br>\

male قنفذ: (MF:) or an animal like the قنفذ;<br>\
(M, K;) it is a certain beast that shakes, and<br>\
shoots forth prickles like arrows: the difference<br>\
between it and the قنفذ is like that between فِئَرَة<br>\
and جِرْذَانْ, and the ox-kind and buffaloes, and<br>\
Arabian camels and those called بَخَاتِىّ: (M:)<br>\
or a certain large thing, larger than the قنفذ,<br>\
