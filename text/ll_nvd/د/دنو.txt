دَنَا, (T, M, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) first pers.<br>\
دَنَوْتُ, (T, S,) aor. يَدْنُو, (T, Msb,) inf. n. دُنُوٌّ<br>\
(T, S, M, Msb, K) and دَنَاوَةٌ, (M, K,) He, or it,<br>\
was, or became, near; drew near, or approached;<br>\
(T, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ ادنى; (IAar,<br>\
T, K;) and ↓ دنّى, inf. n. تَدْنِيَةٌ; (IAar, T;) and<br>\
↓ دانى, inf. n. مُدَانَاةٌ; (KL, but only the inf. n.<br>\
is there mentioned;) and ↓ اِدَّنَى, inf. n. اِدِّنَآءٌ:<br>\
(TA:) it is either in person, or substance, or in<br>\
respect of predicament, and in place, and in<br>\
time: (El-Harállee, TA:) you say, دَنَا مِنْهُ, (M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) and دَنَوْتُ مِنْهُ, (T, S,) and إِلَيْهِ, (M,<br>\
Msb,) and لَهُ, (TA,) and عَلَيْهِ occurs in a verse of<br>\
Sá&#39;ideh as meaning مِنْهُ, (M,) He, or it, and I,<br>\
was, or became, near, &amp;c., to him, or it: (T, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb:) [and in like manner you use the<br>\
other verbs mentioned above, except ↓ دانى,<br>\
which is immediately trans.: or دَنَا مِنْهُ with<br>\
دَنَاوَةٌ for its inf. n. means, or means also, He was<br>\
near to him in respect of kindred; was related to<br>\
him: for] دَنَاوَةٌ is syn. with قَرَابَةٌ (S, M, K) and<br>\
قُرْبَى: (M, K:) you say, بَيْنَهُمَا دَنَاوَةٌ meaning<br>\
قَرَابَةٌ [i. e. Between them two is relationship];<br>\
(S;) and مَا تَزْدَادُ مِنَّا إِلَّا قُرْبًا وَدَنَاوَةٍ [Thou increasest not save in nearness and relationship to<br>\
us]. (ISk, T, S.) A rájiz says,<br>\
مَا لِى أَرَاهُ دَالِفًا قَدْدُنْىَ لَهُ<br>\
meaning دُنِىَ لَهُ [i. e. What hath happened to me<br>\
that I see him walking gently or with short steps,<br>\
or rendered lowly by age, having been approached<br>\
by death?]: it is from دَنَوْتُ, but the و is changed<br>\
into ى because of the kesreh before it, and then<br>\
the ن is made quiescent: and there are similar<br>\
instances of contraction of verbs: but [ISd says,]<br>\
I know not دُنْىَ except in this instance; and As<br>\
used to say of the poem in which this occurs,<br>\
This rejez is not ancient: it is app. of Khalaf ElAhmar or some other of the Muwelleds. (M.)<br>\
One says also, دَنَتِ الشَّمْسُ لِلْمَغُرُوبِ and ↓ أَدْنَت<br>\
[The sun was, or became, near to setting]. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  دَنِىَ, (T, M, K, TA, [in the CK, ما كانَ دَنْيَا<br>\
ولقد دَنا is erroneously put for مَا كَانَ دَنِيًا وَلَقَدْ<br>\
دَنِىَ,]) like رَضِىَ, (TA,) aor. يَدْنَى, (T,) inf. n.<br>\
دَنًا (T, M, K) and دَنَايَةٌ, (T, K, TA,) or دِنَايَةٌ;<br>\
(M, accord. to the TT; and so in the CK; [app.<br>\
a mistranscription occasioned by a misunderstanding of what here follows;]) the ى [in دَنِىَ]<br>\
being substituted for و because of the nearness of<br>\
the kesreh; all on the authority of Lh; (M;) and<br>\
دَنُوَ, aor. يَدْنُو, without ء, inf. n. دَنَآءَةٌ, with ء,<br>\
(ISk, T,) and دُنُوٌّ; (T;) or دَنَا, aor. يَدْنُو, inf. n.<br>\
دَنَاوَةٌ; i. q. دَنَأَ and دَنُؤَ; (Msb;) [i. e.] He (a man,<br>\
T, M) was, or became, such as is termed ↓ دَنِىٌّ;<br>\
(T, M, Msb, K;) and دَنِىْءٌ; (Msb;) meaning<br>\
weak; contemptible (خَسِيسٌ); not profitable to<br>\
any one; who falls short in everything upon<br>\
which he enters: (T: [like مُدَنٍّ:]) or low,<br>\
ignoble, or mean; (سَاقِطٌ;) weak; (M, K;) such<br>\
as, when night affords him covert, will not quit<br>\
his place, by reason of weakness: (M:) or low,<br>\
ignoble, or mean, (لَئِيمٌ,) in his actions, or conduct; bad, evil, or foul; accord. to the explanation of دَنَا by Es-Sarakustee: but some distinguish<br>\
between دَنِىْءٌ and دَنِىٌّ; making the former to<br>\
signify “ low, ignoble, or mean; ” (لَئِيمٌ;) and the<br>\
latter, خَسِيسٌ [app. as meaning contemptible].<br>\
(Msb, and so the latter is explained in the Mgh.)<br>\
2<br>\
دَنَّوَ see 1:<br>\
-A2-  and 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in a trad.,<br>\
سَمُّوا وَ سَمِّتُواوَ دَنُّوا, i.e. [Pronounce ye the name<br>\
of God, (i. e. say, In the name of God,) and<br>\
invoke a blessing upon him at whose abode or<br>\
table ye eat, (see art. سمت,) and] make your<br>\
words to be near together in praising God. (M.)<br>\
And in another trad., إِذَا أَكَلْتُمْ فَسَمُّوا اللّٰهَ وَدَنُّوا,<br>\
i. e. [When ye eat, pronounce the name of God,<br>\
and] eat of that which is near you: (M:) or<br>\
إِذَا أَكَلْتُمْ فَدَنُّوا, i. e. [When ye eat,] eat of that<br>\
which is next you. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  دَنَّى, (T, M,) inf. n.<br>\
تَدْنِيَةٌ, (T,) also signifies He (a man) sought after<br>\
mean, paltry, or contemptible, things. (Lh, T,<br>\
M.) And دنّى فِى الأُمُورِ, (inf. n. as above, S, K,)<br>\
He pursued small matters, and mean, paltry, or<br>\
contemptible: (T, S, TA:) in the K, erroneously,<br>\
and great. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also He was, or became,<br>\
weak; syn. ضَعُفَ. (S and TA in art. دون.)<br>\
3<br>\
دانى, inf. n. مُدَانَاةٌ: see 1, in two places.<br>\
You say also, دَانَيْتُ الأَمْرَ I was, or became, near<br>\
to [doing, or experiencing,] the affair, or event.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  دَانَيْتُ القَيْدَ لِلْبَعِيرِ I made the shackles,<br>\
or hobbles, strait, or contracted, to the camel.<br>\
(M, K.) And دَانَى القَيْدُ قَيْنَىِ البَعِيرِ (M, TA)<br>\
The shackles, or hobbles, straitened, or contracted,<br>\
[the two parts of the camel that were the places<br>\
thereof.] (TA.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says,<br>\
دَانَى لَهُ القَيْدُ فِى دَيْمُومَةٍ قَذَفٍ<br>\
قَيْنَيْهِ وَانْحَسَرَتْ عَنْهُ الأَنَاعِيمُ<br>\
[The shackles, or hobbles, straitened to him, in a<br>\
far-extending, wide desert, the two parts of him<br>\
that were the places thereof, and enjoyments became removed from him]. (M.) And you say<br>\
also, دَانَيْتُ بَيْنَ الأَمْرَيْنِ I made the two affairs,<br>\
or events, to be nearly uninterrupted; syn.<br>\
قَارَبْتُ: (T, S, Msb:) or I made the two affairs,<br>\
or events, to be connected; syn. جَمَعْتُ. (M.)<br>\
4<br>\
ادناهُ He made him, or it, to be, or become,<br>\
near; to draw near, or to approach; he drew<br>\
near, or brought near, him, or it; (S, M, Mgh,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ دنّاهُ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَدْنِيَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] أَدْنَتْ ثَوْبَهَا عَلَيْهَا She (a woman) let<br>\
down her garment upon her, and covered, or<br>\
veiled, herself with it. (Mgh.) And أَدْنَيْتُ السِّتْرَ<br>\
I let down the veil, or curtain, [for the purpose<br>\
of concealment.] (Msb.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[xxxiii. 59], يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنّ مِنْ جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ [They<br>\
shall let down upon them a portion of their outer<br>\
wrapping-garments]; (Mgh;) meaning they shall<br>\
let down a portion of their outer wrapping-garments over their faces, when they go forth for<br>\
their needful purposes, except one eye. (Jel.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
ادنى is also intrans.: see 1, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] أَدْنَتْ, said of a she-camel, (S, TA,) and<br>\
of a woman, (TA,) She was, or became, near to<br>\
bringing forth. (S, TA.) And أَدْنَتْ عَلَى رَأْسِ<br>\
الوَلَدِ [a phrase similar to أَضْرَعَتْ عَلَى رَأْسِ الوَلَدِ,<br>\
q. v.]. (Occurring in a verse cited in the TA in<br>\
art. فكه.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And ادنى He lived a strait life,<br>\
(IAar, T, K,) after easiness and plenty. (IAar, T.)<br>\
5<br>\
تدنّى He (a man, S) drew near, or approached, by little and little. (S, K.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَدَانَوْا They drew near, or approached, one<br>\
to another. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] تدانى It (a<br>\
thing) drew together, or contracted; or became<br>\
drawn together or contracted. (M* and L in art.<br>\
قلص.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And تَدَانَتْ إِبِلُ الرَّجُلَ The camels of<br>\
the man became few and weak. (M.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِدَّنَى, inf. n. اِدِّنَآءٌ: see 1.<br>\
10<br>\
استدناهُ He sought, desired, or demanded,<br>\
of him, nearness, or approach; (M, K, TA;)<br>\
he sought, or desired, to make him draw near, or<br>\
approach: and he drew him near, or caused him<br>\
to approach. (MA. [See also 4.])<br>\
دَنًا inf. n. of دَنِىَ, q. v. (T, M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  أَدْنَى دَنًا:<br>\
see ادنى.<br>\
هُوَ ابْنُ عَمّ دِنْىٍ and دِنْيًا and دِنْيَا and ↓ دُنْيَا<br>\
mean [He is a son of a paternal uncle] closely<br>\
related; syn. لَحًّا [q. v.]: when you pronounce<br>\
the د with damm, you do not make the word<br>\
perfectly decl.: when you pronounce it with<br>\
kesr, you make it either perfectly or imperfectly<br>\
decl.: but when you prefix عَمّ to a determinate<br>\
noun, دِنْى may not be in the gen. case: for instance, you say, هُوَ ابْنُ عَمِّهِ دِنْيًا, i. e. [He is the<br>\
son of his paternal uncle] closely related; as also<br>\
↓ دِنْيَةٌ; because دِنْى, being indeterminate, cannot<br>\
be an epithet applied to that which is determinate:<br>\
(S:) and [in like manner] you say, هُوَ ابْنُ عَمِّى,<br>\
or ابن خَالِى, or ابن عَمَّتِى, or ابن خَالَتِى, or<br>\
ابن أَخِى, or ابن أُخْتِى, (M, K,) all mentioned<br>\
by Lh, the last two as on the authority of Aboo-<br>\
Safwán, but all except the first and second as<br>\
unknown to Ks and to As, (M,) followed by<br>\
↓ دِنْيَةٌ and دِنْيًا and دِنْيَا and ↓ دُنْيَا, (M, K, TA,)<br>\
the last two without tenween, (TA; [and so<br>\
written in the M; but in the CK and my MS.<br>\
copy of the K, in the place of these two is put<br>\
دُنْيًا, which is disallowed by J;]) meaning [He is<br>\
the son of my paternal uncle, and the son of my<br>\
maternal uncle, &amp;c.,] closely related: (M, K:)<br>\
and ↓ هُوَ عَمُّهُ دُنٌيَا and ↓ دِنْيَةً and دِنْيًا and دِنْيَا<br>\
[He is his paternal uncle closely related]: (Ks,<br>\
T:) Lh says that the و is changed into ى in<br>\
↓ دِنْيَةً and دِنٌيًا because of the nearness of the<br>\
kesreh and the weakness of the intervening letter,<br>\
as is the case in فِتْيَةٌ and عِلْيَةٌ: but it seems that<br>\
these words are originally ↓ دُنْيَا, i. e., by a relationship, or uterine relationship, nearer to me<br>\
than others; and that the change of the letter is<br>\
made only to show that the ى is that of the fem.<br>\
of أَدْنَى. (M.) You say also, ↓ هُمْ رَهْطُهُ دِنْيَةً<br>\
They are his people, and his tribe, closely related.<br>\
(S and TA in art. رهط.)<br>\
دِنْيَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in five<br>\
places.<br>\
دُنْيَا fem. of أَدْنَى [q. v.].<br>\
دُنْيِىٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
دُنْيَوِىٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
دُنْيَاوِىٌّ [Of, or relating to, the present world,<br>\
or state of existence; worldly:] a rel. n. from<br>\
الدُّنْيَا; (T, S;) as also ↓ دُنٌيَوِىٌّ and ↓ دُنْيِىٌّ. (S.)<br>\
دَنِىٌّ i. q. قَرِيبٌ [as meaning Near, in person,<br>\
or substance, or in respect of predicament, and in<br>\
place, and in time: (see 1, first sentence: and see<br>\
also دَانٍ:) and a relation]: (T, S:) and a friend;<br>\
or a sincere, or secret, or particular, friend; syn.<br>\
خُلْصَانٌ. (T.) It has these significations (of<br>\
قريب and خلصان) in the prov. كُلُّ دَنِىٍّ دُوَنهُ دَنِىٌّ<br>\
[app. meaning There is a relation, or a friend,<br>\
nearer than every other relation, or friend; like<br>\
another prov., namely, دُونَ كُلِّ قُرَيْبَى قُرْبَى, for<br>\
the meaning and application of which see art.<br>\
قرب: Freytag renders it, “Quod attinet ad<br>\
quemlibet propinquum (amicum), præter eum est<br>\
propinquus:” (Arab. Prov. ii. 357:) and he adds,<br>\
“ Proverbii sensus esse videtur: Quilibet propinquus seu amicus unicus non est; sed præter<br>\
eum est alius ”]: (T, Meyd:) so says AZ.<br>\
(Meyd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also أَدْنَى.<br>\
-A2-  As an epithet applied to a man, signifying Weak; contemptible;<br>\
&amp;c.: see 1, near the end of the paragraph: [but J<br>\
says that] as meaning دُونٌ, it is [دَنِىْءٌ,] with ء:<br>\
(S:) the pl. is أَدْنِيَآءُ. (T, M.) [In the CK, by a<br>\
mistranscription mentioned above (voce دَنِىَ),<br>\
دَنْىٌ is made to signify the same.]<br>\
دَنِيَّهٌ A low, or base, quality, property, natural<br>\
disposition, habit, practice, or action; syn. نَقِيصَةٌ;<br>\
(Mgh;) or such as is blamed; originally دَنِيْئَةٌ:<br>\
(TA:) pl. دَنَايَا. (Har p. 327.) Hence the saying<br>\
of Ibn-Háritheh, المَنِيَّةَ لَا الدَّنِيَّةَ, meaning I choose<br>\
death rather than, or not, disgrace. (Har ubi<br>\
suprà.)<br>\
دَانٍ [Being, or becoming, near; drawing near,<br>\
or approaching: and hence, near; like دَنِىٌّ:]<br>\
act. part. n. of دَنَا مِنْهُ. (Msb.)<br>\
أَدْنَى Nearer, and nearest; opposed to أَقْصَى:<br>\
(TA:) fem. دُنْيَا; (M, TA;) in which the [radical] و is changed into ى, as in عُلْيَا and قُصْيَا:<br>\
(ISd, TA voce بُقْوَى:) [the pl. of the masc. is<br>\
أَدَانٍ and أَدْنَوْنَ; the latter in the accus. and gen.<br>\
أَدْنَيْنِ: and] the pl. of the fem., دُنًى, (S, K,<br>\
TA,) like كُبَرٌ pl. of كُبْرَى, and صُغَرٌ pl. of<br>\
صُغْرَى; (S, TA;) said by some to be extr. and<br>\
strange [in respect of usage]; and El-Mutanebbee<br>\
has been blamed for using it; (MF, TA;) but<br>\
in the case referred to he has used الدُّنَى for<br>\
الدُّنْيَا, [not as a pl.,] suppressing the ى by poetic<br>\
license. (TA.) [Hence,] غُلِبَتِ الرُّومُ فِى أَدْنَى<br>\
الأَرْضِ, in the Kur xxx. 1 and 2, The Greeks<br>\
have been overcome in the nearer, or nearest, part<br>\
of the land. (Bd, Jel.) And الجَمْرَةُ الدُّنْيَا [The<br>\
nearest heap of pebbles;] the heap of pebbles<br>\
nearest to Minè. (TA. [See art. جمر.]) And<br>\
السَّمَآءُ الدُّنْيَا [The nearest heaven; i. e. the lowest;]<br>\
the heaven that is the nearest to us: (T, TA:)<br>\
also called سَمَآءُ الدُّنْيَا [which means the heaven of<br>\
the present world; as will be seen from what<br>\
follows]. (TA.) See also exs. of the fem. in the<br>\
paragraph commencing with the words هُوَ ابْنُ<br>\
عَمٍّ دِنْىٍ, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Former, and<br>\
first; and fore, and foremost; opposed to آخِرٌ.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence,] ↓ لَقِيتُهُ أَدْنَى دَنِىٍّ (S, K, TA)<br>\
and ↓ أَدْنَى دَنًا, (K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
ادنى دَنّىٰ and ادنى دَنِىٍّ,]) i. e. I met him the<br>\
first thing. (S, K.) [And أَدْنَى الفَمِ The fore,<br>\
or foremost, part of the mouth.] And الدُّنْيَا [for<br>\
الدَّارُ الدُّنْيَا, and الحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا, The former dwelling,<br>\
or abode, and life; i. e. the present world, and<br>\
life, or state of existence]; contr. of الآخِرَةُ:<br>\
(M, K:) [or] it is so called because of its nearness: (T, S:) [and may be rendered the sublunary abode, &amp;c.: and the inferior abode, &amp;c.<br>\
It also signifies The enjoyments, blessings, or<br>\
good, of the present world, or life; worldly<br>\
blessings or prosperity, &amp;c.] And sometimes it is<br>\
with tenween, (K, TA,) when used indeterminately: (TA:) [thus,] IAar mentions the saying<br>\
مَا لَهُ دُنْيًا وَ لَا آخِرَةٌ [as meaning He has none of<br>\
the enjoyments, or blessings, of the present world,<br>\
nor in prospect any enjoyments, or blessings, of<br>\
the world to come]; with tenween. (M, TA.)<br>\
And you say, بَاعَ دُنْيَاهُ بِآخِرَتِهِ [He purchased his<br>\
enjoyments of the present world at the expense of<br>\
his enjoyments of the world to come]. (Z, TA<br>\
in art. بيع.) And اَبْنُ الدُّنْيَا means The rich<br>\
man. (Msb in art. بنى.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also More, and<br>\
most, apt, fit, or proper: thus in the Kur<br>\
[xxxiii. 59], in the phrase ذٰلِكَ أَدْنَى أَنْ يُعَرَفْنَ<br>\
[That will be more, or most, apt, fit, or proper,<br>\
that they may be known]; (Ksh, Mgh;) i. e.,<br>\
that they may be known to be free women, as<br>\
distinguished from female slaves, who did not<br>\
cover their faces. (Jel.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also Less [in number<br>\
or quantity &amp;c.], and least [therein]; opposed to<br>\
أَكْثَرُ. (TA.) وَلَا أَدْنَى مِنْ ذٰلِكَ وَلَاأَكْثَرَ, in<br>\
the Kur [lviii. 8], means Nor less in number<br>\
than that, nor more in number. (Bd.) And<br>\
وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُمْ مِنَ الْعَذَابِ الْأَدْنَى دُونَ الْعَذَابِ الْأَكْبَرِ,<br>\
in the Kur [xxxii. 21, lit. And we will assuredly<br>\
make them to taste of the smaller punishment besides<br>\
the greater punishment], means, accord. to Zj, whatever punishment is inflicted in the present world<br>\
and the punishment of the world to come. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  Also Worse, [or inferior in quality,] and<br>\
worst; or more, and most, low, ignoble, base,<br>\
vile, mean, or weak; opposed to خَيْرٌ. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in the Kur [ii. 58], أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ الَّذِى هُوَ<br>\
أَدْنَى بِالَّذِى هُوَ خَيْرٌ [Will ye take in exchange<br>\
that which is worse, or inferior, for that which is<br>\
better? or], accord. to Zj, meaning that which is<br>\
less in value [for that which is better]? ادنى<br>\
being thus, without ء: Fr says that it is here<br>\
from الدَّنَآءَةٌ: and Zuheyr El-Kurkubee [or<br>\
(accord. to some) El-Furkubee] read أَدْنَأُ. (T.)<br>\
مُدْنٍ and مُدْنِيَةٌ, applied to a she-camel, (M,<br>\
K,) and to a woman, (M,) Near to bringing<br>\
forth. (M, K.)<br>\
مُدَنٍّ, applied to a man, Weak; (S, TA;) contemptible (خَسِيسٌ); not profitable to any one;<br>\
who falls short in everything upon which he<br>\
enters; [like دَنِىٌّ;] (TA;) or falling short of<br>\
accomplishing that which it behooves him to do:<br>\
(AHeyth, T:) also, for the sake of rhyme, [by<br>\
poetic license,] written مُدَنْ. (T.)<br>\
