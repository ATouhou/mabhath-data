دَحَرَهُ, (S, A, K,) aor.<br>\
دَحَرَ, (K,) inf. n. دُحُورٌ<br>\
(S, A, K) and دَحْرٌ, (T, K,) He (God, S) drove<br>\
him away; expelled, or banished, him: he removed him; put, or placed, him at a distance, or<br>\
away, or far away: (T, S, A, K:) he pushed,<br>\
thrust, or repelled, him, (K,) with roughness, or<br>\
violence, and ignominy. (TA.) It is said, in a<br>\
form of prayer, اَلّٰهُمَّ ادْحَرْ عَنَّا الشَّيْطَانَ O God,<br>\
drive away from us the devil. (TA.)<br>\
دَحُورٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
دَاحِرٌ and ↓ دَحُورٌ Driving away; expelling, or<br>\
banishing: removing; putting or placing at a<br>\
distance, or away, or far away: pushing, thrusting, or repelling, (K,) [with roughness, or violence, and ignominy: see the verb.] In the Kur<br>\
[xxxvii. 8-9], some read وَيُقْذَفُونَ مِنْ كُلِّ جَانِبٍ<br>\
دَحُورًا, meaning [And they shall be darted at<br>\
from every side] with that which driveth away,<br>\
or expelleth, &amp;c.; as though it were said بِدَاحِرٍ,<br>\
or بِمَا يَدْحَرُ: so says Fr; but he does not approve<br>\
of this reading. (TA.)<br>\
أَدْحَرُ More [or most] violently and ignominiously repelled. (TA from a trad., cited voce<br>\
أَدْحَقُ.)<br>\
مَدْحَرَةٌ [said in Har p. 210 to be syn. with the<br>\
inf. n. دُحورٌ signifies A cause, or means, of<br>\
driving away, &amp;c.].<br>\
مَدْحُورٌ Driven, or removed, far away: so in<br>\
the Kur vii. 17 and xvii. 19. (S.) And hence,<br>\
الشَّيْطَانُ مَدْحُورٌ مِنْ رَحْمَةِ اللّٰهِ The devil is driven<br>\
away, or banished, from the mercy of God. (A.)<br>\
