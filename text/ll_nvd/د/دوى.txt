rising: ” he says that التَّدْوِيمُ is not upon the<br>\

[they say, “He is affected with the remains of<br>\
intoxication; ” and this is his remedy: on me, if<br>\
the case be so, walking to the House of God is<br>\
incumbent]: meaning that they said, “Flogging,<br>\
and chastisement, is his دِوآء: ” but he says, “On<br>\
me is incumbent a pilgrimage walking if I<br>\
have drunk it: ” but it is said [by some] that<br>\
دِوَآءٌ is only an inf. n. of دَاوَيْتُهُ, like مُدَاوَاةٌ. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\

preference, like as the guest has, and the child.<br>\
