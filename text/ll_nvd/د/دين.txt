دَانَ, (IAar, S, K, TA,) aor. يَدِينُ, (IAar,<br>\
M, K, TA,) [inf. n. دِينٌ, (which see below,) in<br>\
this and most of the other senses, or the inf. n. is<br>\
دَيْنٌ, and دِينٌ is a simple subst.,] He was, or<br>\
became, obedient; he obeyed: (IAar, S, M, K,<br>\
TA:) this is the primary signification: or, as<br>\
some say, the primary signification is the following; namely, he was, or became, abased and<br>\
submissive: (IAar, * K, * TA:) or he was, or<br>\
became, abased and enslaved and obedient. (S.)<br>\
You say, دَانَ لَهُ, (S,) and دِنْتُ لَهُ and دِنْتُهُ, (M,<br>\
TA,) He, and I, was, or became, obedient to him<br>\
[&amp;c.], or obeyed him [&amp;c.]. (S, M, TA.) And<br>\
دِنْتُهُ, (M, K,) aor. أَدِينُهُ, (K,) I served him, did<br>\
service for him, or ministered to him, and acted<br>\
well to him. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] He became<br>\
[a servant of God, or] a Muslim. (TK.) You<br>\
say, دَانَ بِالْإِسْلَامِ, inf. n. دِينٌ, with kesr, [and<br>\
دِيَانَةٌ,] He became, or made himself, a servant of<br>\
God by [following the religion of] El-Islám;<br>\
[i. e. he followed El-Islám as his religion;] and<br>\
so ↓ تديّن. (Msb.) And دَانَ بِكَذا, (S,) and<br>\
دِنْتُ بِهِ, (M, K,) inf. n. دِيَانَةٌ [and دِينٌ]; and<br>\
به ↓ تديّن, [and تديّنتُ به; He, and I, followed<br>\
such a thing as his, and my, religion;] (S, TA;)<br>\
from دِينٌ as signifying “ obedience. ” (S.) And<br>\
دان بِدِينِهِمْ He followed them in their religion;<br>\
agreed with them, or was of one mind or opinion<br>\
with them, upon, or respecting, their religion;<br>\
took, or adopted, their religion as his. (TA.)<br>\
And the trad. of &#39;Alee, مَحَبَّةُ العُلَمَآءُ دِينٌ يُدَانُ<br>\
اللّٰهُ بِهِ [The love of the learned is a kind of<br>\
religion with which God is served]. (TA.) In<br>\
the phrase وَ لَا يَدِينُونَ دِينَ الحَقِّ [Nor follow the<br>\
religion of the truth, or the true religion], in the<br>\
Kur ix. 29, El-Islám is meant. (Jel.)<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
He was, or became, disobedient; he disobeyed:<br>\
and he was, or became, mighty, potent, powerful,<br>\
or strong; or high, or elevated, in rank, condition,<br>\
or state; noble, honourable, glorious, or illustrious.<br>\
(IAar, T, K.) Thus it bears significations contr.<br>\
to those mentioned in the first part of this paragraph. (MF.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, (S, M, Msb, K,) first<br>\
pers. دِنْتُ, (T, M8gh,) aor. as above, (T, S, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. دَيْنٌ, (S, Msb,) from المُدَايَنَةُ, (Msb, [see<br>\
3,]) i. q. أَخَذَ الدَّيْنَ, (IKt, M, Msb, K,) or<br>\
[rather] أَخَذَ دَيْنًا, (T,) [He took, or received, a<br>\
loan, or the like; he borrowed: or he took, or<br>\
received, or bought, upon credit; which is the<br>\
meaning generally obtaining: and ↓ اِدَّانَ and<br>\
↓ أَدَانَ and ↓ استدان and ↓ تديّن signify [in like<br>\
manner] أَخَذَ دَيْنًا: (K:) or the first, i. e. دان,<br>\
signifies he sought, or demanded, a loan, or the<br>\
like; (ISk, S, Mgh, Msb;) as also ↓ ادّان and<br>\
↓ استدان: (S, Mgh:) and he became indebted, in<br>\
debt, or under the obligation of a debt: (S:) and<br>\
↓ ادّان and ↓ أَدَانَ and ↓ استدان signify أَخَذَ بِدَيْنٍ<br>\
[he took, or received, by incurring a debt; i. e. he<br>\
took, or received, or bought, upon credit; like<br>\
أَخَذَ دَيْنًا]; (M;) or the first and last of these<br>\
three signify أَخَذَ الدَّيْنَ, and اِقْتَرَضَ [which<br>\
means the same]: but ↓ أَدَانَ signifies he gave, or<br>\
granted, what is termed دَيْنٌ [meaning a loan, or<br>\
the like: or he gave, or granted, or sold, a thing<br>\
upon credit]: (TA:) accord. to Esh-Sheybánee,<br>\
this last verb signifies he became entitled to a<br>\
debt from others [or from another]: Lth says<br>\
that it (أَدَانَ) signifies he was, or became, such as<br>\
is termed مُسْتَدِينٌ; [i. e. it is syn. with استدان,<br>\
as it is said to be in the M and K;] but [Az<br>\
says,] this, which has been mentioned on the<br>\
authority of some one or more by Sh, is in my<br>\
opinion a mistake; أَدَانَ means he sold upon<br>\
credit; or became entitled to a debt from others<br>\
[or from another]; (T, TA;) or he sold to persons<br>\
upon a limited credit, or for payment at an<br>\
appointed period, so that he became entitled to a<br>\
debt from them: (S:) and accord. to Sh, ↓ ادّان<br>\
signifies he became much in debt. (T, TA.)<br>\
El-Ahmar cites the following verse of El-&#39;Ojeyr<br>\
Es-Saloolee:<br>\
نَدِينُ وَيَقْضِى اللّٰهُ عَنَّا وَقَدْ نَرَى<br>\
مَصَارِعَ قَوْمٌ لَا يَدِينُونَ ضُيَّعِ<br>\
[We incur debt, and God pays for us; and<br>\
sometimes, or often, we see the places of overthrow<br>\
of a people, who incur not debt, in a state of<br>\
perdition]: in the S [and the T] ضُيَّعَا; but correctly as above; for the whole of the قَصِيدَة is<br>\
مَخْفُوضَة. (IB, TA.) And it is said in a trad.,<br>\
مُعْرِضًا ↓ اِدَّانَ, (S, K,) or, as some relate it, دَانَ,<br>\
(K,) He bought upon credit, or borrowed, or<br>\
sought or demanded a loan, of whomsoever he<br>\
could, addressing himself to such as came in his<br>\
way: (S, TA:) or both mean he bought upon<br>\
credit avoiding payment: or he contracted a debt<br>\
with every one who presented himself to him:<br>\
(K, TA: [see also other explanations voce<br>\
مُعْرِضٌ:]) ↓ ادّان signifies he bought upon credit:<br>\
(K:) or [thus and also] the contr., i. e. he sold<br>\
upon credit. (T, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also trans.; and so<br>\
is ↓ أَدَانَ. (Msb.) You say, دِنْتُهُ, (M, Mgh, K,<br>\
[in the CK دِينَةٌ is here put for دِنْتُهُ,]) inf. n.<br>\
دَيْنٌ; (TA;) and ↓ أَدَنْتُهُ (M, Mgh, K,) inf. n.<br>\
إِدَانَةٌ; (TA;) I gave him, or granted him, to a<br>\
certain period, what is termed دَيْنٌ [meaning the<br>\
loan, or the like; I lent to him: or I gave him,<br>\
or granted him, credit; or sold to him, upon<br>\
credit]: (M, K, TA:) so that he owed a debt:<br>\
(TA:) and i. q. أَقْرَضْتُهُ [I gave him, or granted<br>\
him, a loan, or the like]; (M, * Mgh, K;) as also<br>\
↓ دَيَّنْتُهُ: (Mgh:) or دِنْتُهُ has this last meaning:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S, M:) and ↓ أَدَنْتُهُ signifies I sought,<br>\
or demanded, of him a loan, or the like; syn.<br>\
اِسْتَقْرَضْتُ مِنْهُ; as also ↓ اِسْتَدَنْتُهُ: (M:) or دِنْتُهُ<br>\
has each of the last two meanings: (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
T, Msb:) and signifies also I received from him<br>\
a loan, or the like. (K.) And one says, ↓ أَدِنِّى<br>\
عَشَرَةَ دَرَاهِمَ meaning Lend thou to me ten dirhems.<br>\
(S, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  دانهُ, (S,) first pers. دِنْتُهُ, (M, Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. دِينٌ (S, M, K) and دَيْنٌ, (M, K,) or<br>\
the latter is the inf. n. and the former is a simple<br>\
subst., (M,) also signifies He repaid, requited,<br>\
compensated, or recompensed, him, (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K,) بِفِعْلِهِ for his deed: and so ↓ داينهُ, inf. n.<br>\
مُدَايَنَةٌ and دِيَانٌ. (M.) And دِنَّاهُمْ We did to<br>\
them like as they did to us. (Ham p. 10.) One<br>\
says, كَمَا تَدِينُ تُدَانُ, (T, S, M,) a prov., (M,)<br>\
meaning Like as thou repayest, or requitest, &amp;c.,<br>\
thou shalt be repaid, or requited, &amp;c.; (S, M;)<br>\
i. e. according to thy deed thou shalt be repaid,<br>\
or requited, &amp;c.: (S:) or, as some say, like as<br>\
thou doest, it shall be done to thee: (M:) or like<br>\
as thou doest thou shalt be given, and repaid, &amp;c.<br>\
(T.) And it is said in a trad., اَللّٰهُمَّ دِنْهُمْ كَمَا<br>\
يَدِينُونَنَا, meaning O God, repay them, or requite<br>\
them, &amp;c., with [the like of] that which they do<br>\
to us. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اَللّٰهُ لَيَدِينُ مِنَ الجَمَّّآءِ لِلْقَرْنَآءِ, a<br>\
trad. of Selmán, means God will assuredly retaliate [for her that is hornless upon her that is<br>\
horned]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And one says, مَنْ دَانَ نَفْسَهُ<br>\
رَبِحَ, i. e. He who reckons with himself [gains]<br>\
(Ham p. 10. [Or the verb may here have the<br>\
meaning next following.])<br>\
-A5-  Also, دانهُ, He<br>\
abased him, (T, S, K,) and enslaved him. (T, S.)<br>\
Hence, (T,) it is said in a trad., الكَيِّسُ مَنْ دَانَ<br>\
نَفْسَهُ وَعَمِلَ لِمَا بَعْدَ المَوْتِ, (S, T,) i. e. [The<br>\
intelligent is] he who abases, and enslaves, himself<br>\
[and works for that which shall be after death]:<br>\
or, as some say, who reckons with himself: (T:)<br>\
or, accord. to some, who overcomes himself.<br>\
(TA.) And دانهُ, (K,) first pers. دِنْتُهُ, (T,)<br>\
signifies He made him to do that which he disliked. (AZ, T, K.) And دِينَ He was made to<br>\
do that which he disliked. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And دِنْتُهُ,<br>\
inf. n. دِينٌ, I ruled, governed, or managed, him,<br>\
or it. (M, TA.) And I possessed it; owned it;<br>\
or exercised, or had, authority over it. (Sh, S,<br>\
K, TA.)<br>\
-A6-  دان, (IAar, T, K,) aor. يَدِينٌ, (K,)<br>\
[inf. n., app., دِينٌ, which see below,] signifies<br>\
also He became accustomed or habituated, or he<br>\
accustomed or habituated himself, to good or to<br>\
evil: (IAar, T, K:) and, accord. to Lth, (T,)<br>\
دِينَ signifies he was accustomed or habituated:<br>\
(T, M:) or, as some say, دِينٌ signifying “ custom,” or “ habit,” has no verb. (M.)<br>\
-A7-  And<br>\
He (a man, IAar, T) was, or became, smitten, or<br>\
affected, by a disease. (IAar, T, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
ديّنهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَدْيِينٌ, (S,<br>\
K,) He left him to his religion; (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K;) left him and his religion, not opposing him<br>\
in that which he held allowable in his belief.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He believed him: so in the saying,<br>\
ديّنهُ فِى القَضَآءِ [He believed him in respect of the<br>\
judgment, or judicial decision], (T, M, Mgh, *)<br>\
and فِيمَا بَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ اللّٰهَ [in respect of what was<br>\
between him and God]: (T, M:) but this is a<br>\
conventional signification used by the professors.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  دَيَّنْتُ الحَالِفَ (T, TA) I confirmed<br>\
the swearer (قَوَّيْتُهُ [so in the TA, but in the T<br>\
بَرَّيْتُهُ, app. for بَرَّأْتُهُ, I held him, or pronounced<br>\
him, to be clear, or quit, if not a mistranscription<br>\
for قَوَّيْتُهُ,]) in that which he swore. (T, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, in the latter half of the paragraph.<br>\
-A3-  دَيَّنْتُهُ القَوْمَ I made him ruler, governor, or<br>\
manager of the affairs, of the people, or company<br>\
of men. (M.) And ديّنهُ الشَّىْءَ, (T, * TA,) inf. n.<br>\
as above, (TA,) He made him to possess the<br>\
thing: to own it; or to exercise, or have, authority<br>\
over it. (T, * TA.) El-Hotei-ah says, (T, S, M,)<br>\
addressing his mother, (T,)<br>\
لَقَدْ دُيِّنْتِ أَمْرَ بَنِيكِ حَتَّى<br>\
تَرَكْتِهِمُ أَدَقَّ مِنَ الطَّحِينِ<br>\
(T, S, M,) meaning مُلِّكْتِ [i. e. Verily thou hast<br>\
been made to have the ordering of the affairs of<br>\
thy sons until thou hast rendered them finer than<br>\
flour]. (T, S.) And hence the saying, يُدَيَّنُ<br>\
الرَّجُلُ أَمْرَهُ i. e. يُمَلَّكُ [The man shall be made to<br>\
have the ordering of his affair, or affairs, or<br>\
case]. (Sh, T.)<br>\

-A2-  See also 1, in the latter half of the paragraph.<br>\
-A3-  Each of the inf. ns. mentioned above is<br>\
also syn. with مُحَاكَمَةٌ [The summoning another<br>\

in the former half of the paragraph, in three<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  As a trans. v.: see 1, in the latter half<br>\
of the paragraph, in four places. ―<br>\
-b3-  [The following<br>\
significations, namely, “Subegit,” and “ Pensavit,” assigned to this verb by Golius as on the<br>\
authority of the KL, and “ Voluit sibi esse servum,” and “ Servum cepit,” followed by an<br>\
accus., assigned to it by him as on the authority<br>\
of the S, I do not find in either of those works.]<br>\
5<br>\
تديّن: see 1, in the former half of the<br>\
paragraph, in three places.<br>\
6<br>\
تَدَايَنُوا They sold and bought, one with<br>\
another, upon credit; and in like manner تَدَايَنَا<br>\
is said of two persons: (S:) or they took, or<br>\
received, or bought, upon credit [app. one of<br>\
another]: and so اِدَّايَنُوا [which is a variation of<br>\
the former]. (M.) إِذَا تَدَيَنْتُمْ بِدَيْنٍ, in the<br>\
Kur ii. 282, means When ye deal, one with<br>\
another, (Ksh, Bd, Jel, Msb,) upon credit, giving<br>\
or taking, (Ksh, * Bd,) or by prepayment, (Jel,<br>\
Msb,) or lending or the like, (Jel,) &amp;c. (Msb.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِدَّانَ, originally اِدْتَانَ: see 1, in six places.<br>\
10<br>\
استدان, as an intrans. v.: see 1, in the<br>\
former half of the paragraph, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
استدانهُ He sought, or demanded, of him what is<br>\
termed دَيْنٌ [meaning a debt]: and also i. q.<br>\
اِسْتَقْرَضَ مِنْهُ. (M.) See 1, in the latter half of the<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
دَيْنٌ [is an inf. n. of 1: ―<br>\
-b2-  and is also a simple<br>\
subst., and] properly signifies [A debt; such as]<br>\
the price of a thing sold [which the purchaser is<br>\
under an obligation to pay]; and a dowry<br>\
[which one engages to pay]: and a loan, or the<br>\
like; syn. قَرْض: (Msb:) or it is [a debt] such<br>\
as has an appointed time of falling due: what<br>\
has not such an appointed time is [properly, but<br>\
not always,] termed قَرْضٌ: (K:) and ↓ دِينَةٌ<br>\
signifies the same as دَيْنٌ (T, M, K) in the sense<br>\
above explained: (K:) a valid دَينْ (دَينٌ صَحِيحٌ)<br>\
is such as does not become annulled save by payment, or by one&#39;s being declared clear, or quit:<br>\
compensation in the case of a contract which a<br>\
slave makes with his owner to pay him a certain<br>\
sum as the price of himself and on the payment<br>\
thereof to be free is not a valid دَيْن, because it<br>\
may become annulled without payment, and<br>\
without his being declared clear, or quit; that is,<br>\
by the slave&#39;s being unable to pay it: (KT:) in<br>\
the language of the law, but not in the proper<br>\
language, دَيْنٌ is also applied to (assumed tropical:)  [a debt incurred<br>\
by] a thing taken unjustly, injuriously, or by violence; as being likened to a دَيْن properly so<br>\
called: (Msb:) and it signifies also anything that<br>\
is not present: [app. meaning anything to be paid,<br>\
or done, at a future time:] (M, K:) the pl. [of<br>\
pauc.] is أَدْيُنٌ (Lh, M, K) and [of mult.] دُيُونٌ<br>\
(S, M, K) [and in the CK is added and دِينَةٌ, with<br>\
kesr; but this is a mistranscription for دِنْتُهُ, as<br>\
syn. with أَدَنْتُهُ, which follows it, connected therewith by وَ]: the pl. of ↓ دِينَةٌ is دِيَنٌ. (TA.) You<br>\
say, مَا أَكْثرَ دَيْنَهُ and ↓ دِينَتَهُ [How great in<br>\
amount. is his debt!]; both meaning the same.<br>\
(AZ, T.) And ↓ جِئْتُ لِطَلَبِ الدِّينَةِ i. e. الدَّيْنِ<br>\
[I came for the demanding of the debt]. (AZ, T.)<br>\
And عَلَيْهِ دَيْنٌ [On him lies a debt; i. e. he owes<br>\
a debt]: and لَهُ دَيْنٌ [To him is due a debt; i. e.<br>\
he has a debt owed to him]. (S, TA.) And اِشْتَرَى<br>\
بِالدَّيْنِ [He bought upon credit]: (K:) and<br>\
أَخَذَ الدَّيْنَ (IKt, M, Msb, K) or [rather] أَخَذَ<br>\
دَيْنًا [signifies the same; or he took, or received,<br>\
upon credit: or he took, or received, a loan, or<br>\
the like; he borrowed]: (T, K:) and أَخَذَ بِدَيْنٍ<br>\
[likewise signifies the same; or he took, or received, by incurring a debt]. (M.) And بَاعَ<br>\
بِالدَّيْنِ [He sold upon credit]: (K:) and بِعْثُهُ<br>\
بِدَيْنٍ (TA) or ↓ بِدِينَةٍ (S) [I sold to him upon<br>\
credit]: and أَعْطَيْتُهُ الدَّيْنَ [signifies the same; or<br>\
I gave him, or granted him, credit: or I gave<br>\
him, or granted him, the loan, or the like].<br>\
(M, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  Death; (K, TA;)<br>\
because it is a دَيْن [or debt] which every one<br>\
must pay when [the angel who is] the demander<br>\
of its payment comes. (TA.) And hence the<br>\
prov., رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ بِدَيْنِهِ (tropical:)  [May God smite him<br>\
with his death]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Thaalebeh Ibn-&#39;Obeyd<br>\
says, describing palm-trees,<br>\
تَضَمَّنُ الحَاجَاتِ العِيَالِ وَ ضَيْفِهِمْ<br>\
وَمَهْمَا تَضَمَّنْ مِنْ دُيُونِهِمْ تَقْضِ<br>\
[They comprise the wants of the household and<br>\
of their guest; and whatever they comprise of<br>\
their debts, they pay]; by the دُيُون meaning<br>\
what is obtained of their fruit that is gathered.<br>\
(M, TA.)<br>\
دِينٌ [is an inf. n. of 1: and is also used as a<br>\
simple subst., signifying] Obedience; (T, S, M,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ دِينَةٌ: (K: [in the M it is said,<br>\
without any restriction, that دِينَةٌ is like دِينٌ:])<br>\
this is its primary meaning: and its pl. is أَدْيَانٌ:<br>\
or, as some say, its primary meaning is that next<br>\
following: (TA:) a state of abasement, (M, K,<br>\
TA,) and submissiveness. (TA.) الدِّينُ لِلّٰهِ means<br>\
Obedience to, and the service of, God. (T, K. *)<br>\
And the saying, in the Kur [iv. 124], وَ مَنْ أَحْسَنُ<br>\
دِينًا مِمَنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلّٰهِ means [And who is<br>\
better] in obedience [than he who resigns himself<br>\
to God?] (Er-Rághib, TA.) In like manner,<br>\
also, in the same [ii. 257], لَا إِكْرَاهَ فِى الدِّينِ<br>\
means [There shall be no compulsion] in obedience. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A religion: (K, and<br>\
in one of my copies of the S:) pl. as above: (S:)<br>\
so termed as implying obedience, and submission<br>\
to the law: [for ex.,] it is said in the Kur [iii. 17],<br>\
إِنَّ الدِّينَ عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ الْإِسْلَامُ [Verily the only true<br>\
religion in the sight of God is El-Islám]. (TA.)<br>\
الدِّينُ is a name for That whereby one serves<br>\
God. (S, * K.) [It is applied to Religion, in the<br>\
widest sense of this term, practical and doctrinal:<br>\
thus comprehending الإِيمَانُ, which means “ religious belief. ”] And it [particularly] signifies<br>\
[The religion of] El-Islám. (M, K.) And The<br>\
religious law of God; consisting of such ordinances as those of fasting and prayer and pilgrimage and the giving of the poor-rate, and the<br>\
other acts of piety, or of obedience to God, or of<br>\
duty to Him and to men; syn. الشَّرِيعَةُ. (TA.)<br>\
And The belief in the unity of God. (K.) And<br>\
Piety, or pious fear, and abstinence from unlawful things; syn. الوَرَعُ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A<br>\
particular law; a statute; or an ordinance; syn.<br>\
حُكْمٌ (K, and Jel in xii. 76) and قَضَآءٌ [which<br>\
signifies the same as حُكْمٌ]. (Katádeh, T, K.) It<br>\
is said in the Kur [xii. 76], مَا كَانَ لِيَأْخُذَ أَخَاهُ فِى<br>\
دِينِ الْمَلِكِ, meaning He (Joseph) was not to<br>\
take his brother as a slave for the theft according<br>\
to the law of the king of Egypt; i. e., فِى حُكْمِ<br>\
مَلِكِ مِصْرَ, (Jel,) or فىقَضَائِهِ; (Katádeh, T;)<br>\
for his punishment according to him was beating,<br>\
and a fine of twice the value of the thing stolen;<br>\
not enslavement: (Jel:) or, accord. to ElUmawee, the meaning is, in the dominion of the<br>\
King. (T.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [A system of usages, or rites and<br>\
ceremonies &amp;c., inherited from a series of ancestors.] It is said in a trad., of the Prophet,<br>\
كَانَ عَلَى دِينِ قَوْمِهِ, meaning He used to conform with the old usages obtaining among his<br>\
people, inherited from Abraham and Ishmael, in<br>\
respect of their pilgrimage and their marriagecustoms (IAth, K, TA) and their inheritances<br>\
(IAth, TA) and their modes of buying and selling<br>\
and their ways of acting, (IAth, K, TA,) and<br>\
other ordinances of the faith [&amp;c.]; (IAth, TA;)<br>\
but as to the belief in the unity of God, they had<br>\
altered it; and the Prophet held no other belief<br>\
than it: (IAth, K, TA:) or, as some say, the<br>\
meaning here is, their dispositions, in respect of<br>\
generosity and courage; from دِينٌ in the sense<br>\
next following. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Custom, or habit;<br>\
(AZ, T, S, M, K;) as also ↓ دِينَةٌ: (M, * TA:)<br>\
and business: (S, TA:) pl., as above, أَدْيَانٌ.<br>\
(M, TA.) This, also, has been said to be the<br>\
primary signification. (TA.) One says, مَا زَالَ<br>\
ذٰلِكَ دِينِى That has not ceased to be my custom,<br>\
or habit. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  A way, course, mode, or<br>\
manner, of acting, or conduct, or the like. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  I. q. تَدْبِيرٌ [app. as meaning Management,<br>\
conduct, or regulation, of affairs]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  State,<br>\
condition, or case. (S, M, K.) ISh says, I asked<br>\
an Arab of the desert respecting a thing, and he<br>\
said to me, لَوْ لَقِيتَنِى عَلَى دِنٍ غَيْرِ هٰذِهِ لَأَخْبَرْتُكَ<br>\
[Hadst thou found me in a state other than this,<br>\
I had informed thee]. (S, M.) ―<br>\
-b9-  A property,<br>\
such as is an unknown cause of a known effect;<br>\
syn. خَاصِّيَّةٌ. (KL. [The significations of “ Via ”<br>\
and “ Signum ” and “ Opera,” mentioned by<br>\
Golius as from the KL, I do not find in my copy<br>\
of that work.])<br>\
-A2-  Disobedience. (S, K.) [Thus<br>\
it bears a signification the contr. of that first<br>\
mentioned in this paragraph.]<br>\
-A3-  Repayment, requital, compensation, or recompense: (S, M, K:)<br>\
or, as some say, such as is proportioned to the<br>\
deed of him who is its object. (TA.) Hence,<br>\
مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ, i. e. [The King] of the day of<br>\
requital, in the Kur [i. 3]: (M, T, TA:) or the<br>\
meaning in this instance is the next but one of<br>\
those here following. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Retaliation,<br>\
by slaying for slaying, or wounding for wounding,<br>\
or mutilating for mutilating. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A reckoning. (T, S, M, K.) [See the sentence next but<br>\
one above.] Hence, in the Kur [ix. 36], ذٰلِكَ<br>\
الدِّينُ القَيِّمُ [is said to mean] That is the right,<br>\
correct, or true, reckoning. (T, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  Compulsion against the will: (K:) subdual, subjection,<br>\
or subjugation; ascendency: sovereign, or ruling,<br>\
power; or power of dominion: (S, K:) mastership, or ownership; or the exercise, or possession,<br>\
of authority. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A5-  A disease: (Lh, IAar,<br>\
T, S, M, K:) or, accord. to El-Mufaddal, an old<br>\
disease. (IAar, T.)<br>\
-A6-  [It is said to signify also]<br>\
A constant, or a gentle, rain; as also ↓ دِينَةٌ:<br>\
(K:) accord. to the book of Lth, [by which is<br>\
meant the &#39;Eyn,] (T,) rain that has been constantly, (T,) or usually, (K,) recurring in a place:<br>\
(T, K:) but this is a mistake of Lth, or of some<br>\
one who has added it in his book: a verse of Et-<br>\
Tirimmáh, there cited as an ex., ends with وَدِينِ,<br>\
which is in that instance syn. with مَوْدُون, meaning “ moistened; ” its و being the primal radical,<br>\
not the conjunction وَ; and دِينٌ as meaning any<br>\
kind of rain being unknown. (T, TA.)<br>\
-A7-  See<br>\
also دَائِنٌ.<br>\
دَيْنَةٌ, (so in the TT, as from the T,) or ↓ دِينَةٌ,<br>\
with kesr, (so in the TA,) A cause of death.<br>\
(T, TA.)<br>\
دِينَةٌ: see دَيْنٌ, in five places:<br>\
-A2-  and دِينٌ, in<br>\
three places:<br>\
-A3-  and دَيْنَةٌ.<br>\
دَيِّنٌ Religious; or one who makes himself a<br>\
servant of God; (S, Msb;) as also ↓ مُتَدَيِّنٌ. (S.)<br>\
دَيَّانٌ A requiter, (S, M, K,) who neglects not<br>\
any deed, but requites it, with good and with evil;<br>\
(K, TA;) in this sense, with the article ال,<br>\
applied as an epithet to God: (S, M, TA:) a<br>\
subduer; (T, K;) applied to a man in this sense;<br>\
(T;) and also, in the same sense, with the article<br>\
ال, to God: (TA:) a judge; a ruler, or governor;<br>\
(T, K;) in these senses, likewise, applied to a<br>\
man; and, with the article ال, to God: (T:) a<br>\
manager, a conducter, or an orderer, (S, M, K,)<br>\
of affairs of another. (S.)<br>\
دَائِنٌ A debtor; (S, M, Msb, * K;) as also<br>\
↓ مَدِينٌ and ↓ مَدْيُونٌ, (S, * M, Msb, * K,) this last<br>\

and ↓ مُدَّانٌ: (K:) or all of these, (M, K,) or<br>\
↓ مَدْيُونٌ, (S, TA,) one much in debt: (S, M, K,<br>\
TA:) and ↓ مُدَّانٌ, constantly in debt: (Sh, T:)<br>\
and دَائِنٌ signifies one who takes, or receives, a<br>\
loan, or the like; who borrows; or who takes, or<br>\
receives, or buys, upon credit: (Sh, T, Msb:)<br>\
and also one who repays a debt: (Sh, T, TA:)<br>\
thus bearing two contr. meanings: (TA:) or also<br>\
one who gives, or grants, credit; or sells upon<br>\
credit: (Msb:) pl. دَائِنُونَ, with which ↓ دِينٌ is<br>\
syn. [as a quasi-pl. n.], as in the saying of a poet,<br>\
وَكَانَالنَّاسُ إِلَّا نَحْنُ دِينَا<br>\
[And the people, except us, were debtors]. (S.)<br>\
مُدَانٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مَدِينٌ: see دَائِنٌ.<br>\
-A2-  [Also Repaid, requited,<br>\
compensated, or recompensed: and reckoned with.]<br>\
أَئِنَّا لَمَدِينُونَ, in the Kur [xxxvii. 51], means<br>\
Shall we indeed be requited, and reckoned with?<br>\
(S, TA.) [See also what follows, in two places.]<br>\
-A3-  Possessed; owned; had, or held, under authority: (TA:) [and hence,] a slave; fem. with<br>\

meaning] not requited [for your deeds]. (T.)<br>\
[And it is said that] أَئِنَّا لَمَدِينُوننَ [mentioned<br>\
above] means ائنّا لَمَمْلُوكُونَ [i. e. Shall we indeed<br>\
be held in possession, or under authority, as<br>\
servants of God?]. (M.)<br>\
مَدِينَةٌ A city; syn. مِصْرٌ: (S, K:) so called<br>\
