or دَوْسٌ and دِيَاسٌ, but some say that دِيَاسٌ is<br>\
not of the language of the Arabs, and some say<br>\
that it is tropical, as though from دَاسَ in the<br>\
sense explained above, (Msb,) or the professors<br>\
of practical religion use it in the place of دِيَاسَةٌ<br>\
by a kind of license, relying upon the understanding of the hearer or reader, or do so erroneously, (Mgh,) He trod, or thrashed, (M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) the wheat, (Mgh, Msb,) or grain, (M,)<br>\
either by the feet of beasts, or by repeatedly<br>\
drawing over it the مِدْوَس [q. v. infrà] until it<br>\

↓ أَدَاسَهُ. (M.) You say, دَاسُوهُ دَوْسَ الحَصِيدِ<br>\

دَوْسٌ, (A, K,) (tropical:)  Inivit eam; scil., feminam:<br>\
(A:) vehementer inivit eam: (A, K: [in the<br>\

it; namely, a sword, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
and the like, (K,) or some other thing. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  Hence, دَوْسٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The framing,<br>\
and dressing up, of deceit, guile, or circumvention: (As, A, TA:) [agreeably with which explanation the verb, دَاسَ, is probably used, though<br>\
not mentioned in the A nor in the TA:] or<br>\
simply, the act of deceiving, beguiling, circumventing, and practising artifice. (TA.) You say,<br>\
أَخَذْنَا فِى الدَّوْسِ (tropical:)  We set about the framing, and<br>\
dressing up, of deceit, guile, or circumvention:<br>\
(A:) or we set about deceiving, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
