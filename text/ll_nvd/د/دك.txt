دَكَّ, aor.<br>\
دَكُ3َ, (S,) inf. n. دَكٌّ, (S, K,) He<br>\
broke, or crushed, in any manner; or bruised,<br>\
brayed, or pounded; i. e., beat with a thing so<br>\
as to break or crush; i. q. دَقَّ. (S, K.) He<br>\
threw down, pulled to pieces, or demolished. (K.)<br>\
He broke a wall, and a mountain. (Lth, TA.)<br>\
He beat a thing and broke it so as to lay it even<br>\
with the ground. (S.) Hence the saying in the<br>\
Kur [lxix. 14], فَدُكَّتَا دَكَّةً وَاحِدَةً, (S,) i. e.<br>\
And they shall be beaten together with one beating, and the whole shall become fine dust: or<br>\
they shall both be spread with one spreading,<br>\
so as to become an even ground. (Bd.) [For]<br>\
دَكَّ الأَرْضَ, (TA,) inf. n. as above, (K, TA,)<br>\
means He made even the elevations and depressions of the earth, or ground. (K, TA.) أَذَا<br>\
دُكَّتِ الأَرْضُ دَكًّا, in the Kur [lxxxix. 22], means<br>\
When the earth shall be made level, without<br>\
hills, (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, Bd,) and without mountains:<br>\
or it means, shall become fine dust scattered:<br>\
(Bd:) or shall be shaken so that every building<br>\
thereon shall be demolished and non-existent.<br>\
(Jel.) See also دَكٌّ below. ―<br>\
-b2-  دَكٌّ also signifies<br>\
The spreading (كَبْس [for which كَنْس is erroneously put in the CK]) of earth, and making it<br>\
even. (K.) When a roof, or flat house-top, has<br>\
been spread with earth (كُبَِسَ بِالتُّرَابِ), one says,<br>\
دُكَّ التُّرَابُ عَلَيْهِ [Earth was spread upon it]:<br>\
and دَكَّ التُّرَابَ عَلَى المَيِّتِ, inf. n. دَكٌّ, means<br>\
He poured earth upon the corpse. (AZ, AHn.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also The filling up a well (K, TA) with<br>\
earth; and so ↓ دَكْدَكَةٌ. (TA.) You say,<br>\
دَكَكْتُ الرَّكِىَّ I filled up the wells with earth:<br>\
(S:) and الرَّكِىَّ ↓ دَكْدَكَ He filled up the wells<br>\
with earth. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And دَكَّهُ signifies also<br>\
He pushed him, or thrust him; like صَكَّهُ and<br>\
لَكَّهُ. (As, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence,] دَكَّ جَارِيَتَهُ (tropical:)  He<br>\
(a man) distressed his young woman, or female<br>\
slave, by throwing his weight upon her when<br>\
desiring to compress her. (AA, TA. [See also<br>\
رَكَّ.]) And دَكَّ الدَّابَّةَ بِالسَّيْرِ (tropical:)  He distressed, or<br>\
jaded, or fatigued, the beast by journeying.<br>\
(TA.) And دُكَّ الرَّجُلُ, (S, K,) i. e. دَكَّتْهُ الحُمَّى,<br>\
(AZ, S,) or دَكَّهُ المَرَضُ, (K,) meaning (tropical:)  Fever,<br>\
or disease, weakened the man: (TA:) or he<br>\
became sick, or ill. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And دَكٌّ also signifies The sending forth camels all together. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
دكّكهُ He mixed it; namely, colocynth<br>\
with dates or some other thing. (O, L, K.) You<br>\
say, دَكِّكُوا لَنَا Mix ye for us. (L, O.) [See<br>\
مُدَكَّكٌ.]<br>\
6<br>\
تداكّ عَلَيْهِ القَوْمُ The people pressed, or<br>\
crowded, upon him. (TA.) It is said in a trad.<br>\
of &#39;Alee, ثُمَّ تَدَاكَكْتُمْ عَلَىَّ تَدَاكُكَ الإِبِلِ الهِيمِ<br>\
عَلَى حِيَاضِهَا, i. e. Then ye pressed [upon me like<br>\
the pressing of thirsty camels upon their wateringtroughs]. (TA.) And one says, تَدَاكَّتْ عَلَيْهِمُ<br>\
الخَيْلُ The horses, or horsemen, pressed upon<br>\
them. (TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
اندكّ It (a place) became levelled, its elevations and depressions being made even. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
It (a camel&#39;s hump) became spread upon the<br>\
animal&#39;s sides, (TA,) or upon his back. (IDrd,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\

R. Q. 1<br>\
دَكْدَكَ, inf. n. دَكْدَكَةٌ: see 1, in<br>\
two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says of the stallion-camel<br>\
when he covers, يُدَكْدِكُ النَّاقَةَ [app. meaning<br>\
He distresses the she-camel by his weight: see<br>\
دَكَّ الجَارِيَتَهُ, above]. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَدَكْدَكَثِ الجِبَالُ The mountains became دَكَّاوَات, i. e. hills of mould or clay. (S.)<br>\
دَكٌّ An even, or a level, place; (K;) [and so<br>\
↓ أَدَكُّ, as is shown by an explanation of its fem. in<br>\
this paragraph:] or land, or ground, broken, and<br>\
made even: (S:) you say أَرْضٌ دَكٌّ: (Akh, S:)<br>\
pl. دُكُوكٌ. (S, K.) Hence, in the Kur [vii. 139<br>\
and xviii. 98], جَعَلَهُ دَكًّا, (Akh, S, TA,) i. e.<br>\
[He made it, in the former instance, and shall<br>\
make it, in the latter instance,] even, or level,<br>\
(AZ, Az, Ibn-&#39;Arafeh,) without any hill: (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Arafeh: [this addition relating to the former<br>\
instance:]) or crumbled: (Ksh, * Bd:) or, accord.<br>\
to Akh, دَكًّا may be here an inf. n.; as though<br>\
the meaning were ↓ دَكَّهُ دَكًّا: [see 1:] or it may<br>\
be elliptical, meaning جَعَلَهُ ذَا دَكٍّ: another<br>\
reading is ↓ جَعَلَهُ دَكَّآءَ, (S,) meaning in the<br>\
former instance a hill rising from the ground like<br>\
the دَكَّةَ: (Ksh:) or meaning جَعَلَهُ أَرْضًا دَكَّآءَ,<br>\
(S,) i. e. He made it even, or level, ground;<br>\
(Ksh, Bd;) because the word جَبَل [to which<br>\
دكّآء virtually relates] is masc. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, [as<br>\
a subst.,] Even, or level, sand; and so ↓ دَكَّةٌ: pl.<br>\
[of either, agreeably with analogy,] دِكَاكٌ. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And A [mound, or hill, of dust or earth, such<br>\
as is called] تَلّ: (K:) or the like of a تَلّ: (L:)<br>\
in some of the copies of the K, التكّ is erroneously<br>\
put for التّل. (TA.)<br>\
دُكٌّ A low mountain: (S, K:) or an elevated,<br>\
or overlooking, hill of mould, or clay, in which is<br>\
somewhat of ruggedness: (As, TA:) pl. دِكَكَةٌ;<br>\
(As, S, K;) and دِكَكٌ [app. another, though<br>\
irregular, pl. of the same,] is said to signify<br>\
قِيرَان [i. e. small isolated mountains, or knolls of<br>\
mountains, &amp;c., (see قَارَةٌ,)] breaking, or crumbling,<br>\
down: or disintegrated [hills, or mountains, such<br>\
as are called] هِضَاب. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [See also أَدَكُّ,<br>\
of which it is a pl.]<br>\
-A2-  Also Strong and bulky.<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
دَكَّةٌ A certain thing, (S,) [i. e.] an elevated<br>\
place, (Msb,) a flat-topped structure, (K,) upon<br>\
which one sits; (S, Msb, K;) i. q. مَسْطَبَةٌ [a<br>\
kind of wide bench, of stone or brick &amp;c., generally built against a wall]: (Msb:) pronounced<br>\
by the vulgar ↓ دِكَّةٌ [and commonly applied by<br>\
them to a long seat of wood]: (TA:) and<br>\
↓ دُكَّانٌ signifies the same; (S, Msb, K;) but<br>\
accord. to some, this belongs to art. دكن [q. v.]:<br>\
(S, Msb, TA:) the pl. of the former is دِكَكٌ, like<br>\
as the pl. of قَصْعَةٌ is قِصَعٌ: (Msb:) and the pl.<br>\
of ↓ دُكَّانٌ is دَكَاكِينُ. (TA.) [For another<br>\
modern application, see مَحْفِلٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  See also دَكٌّ.<br>\
دِكَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[It is also vulgarly used for تِكَّةٌ, q. v.]<br>\

bruised, or crushed. (TA.)<br>\
دُكَكَةٌ A thing [meaning food] made of هَبِيد<br>\
[i. e. colocynths, or colocynth-seeds,] and flour,<br>\
when flour is scarce. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA.) [See<br>\
also مُدَّكَكٌ.]<br>\
دَكِيكٌ, applied to a year, (S, TA,) and a month,<br>\
(TA,) and a day, (K,) Complete. (S, K.)<br>\
دَكَّآءُ, fem. of أَدَكُّ [q. v.], used as a subst.,<br>\
(TA,) A hill of mould or clay, (As, S, M, K,)<br>\
not rugged, (As, M, K,) nor amounting to a<br>\
mountain: (TA:) or the pl. signifies natural<br>\
[mounds, or hills, of dust or earth, such as are<br>\
called] تِلَال: (TA:) the pl. is دَكَّاوَاتٌ, (As, S,<br>\
M, K,) because it is used as a subst.: (TA:) or<br>\
it has no sing.: (K:) ISd says, this is what the<br>\
lexicologists say; but in my opinion the sing. is<br>\
دَكَّآءُ. (TA.)<br>\
دُكَّانٌ: see دَكَّةٌ, in two places: and see also<br>\
art. دكن.<br>\
دَكْدَكٌ and دِكْدِكٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
دَكْدَاكٌ (As, S, K) and ↓ دَكْدَكٌ and ↓ دِكْدِكٌ<br>\

much elevated: (As, TA:) or sand containing<br>\
dust or earth, compacted together: (AHn, TA:)<br>\

which is ruggedness: (K:) or a low, or depressed,<br>\

ة: (ISh, T in art. ربو:) pl. دَكَادِيكُ and دَكَادِكُ.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
أَدَكُّ, and its fem. دَكَّآءُ: see دَكٌّ. You say also<br>\
أَكَمَةٌ دَكَّآءُ, meaning A hill wide [and app. flat,<br>\
or nearly so,] in its top: (TA:) or an expanded<br>\
hill: (Msb:) pl. دَكَّاوَاتٌ, which is extr. in this<br>\
case, because دكّآء is here an epithet. (TA.)<br>\
And دُكٌّ, [its regular pl.,] applied to sands, Even<br>\
and compact. (AHn, M in art. ذلف.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\

sides: (TA:) pl. دُكٌّ and دَكَّاوَاتٌ, (S,) said in the<br>\
S to be like حُمْرٌ and حَمْرَاوَاتٌ, but one does not<br>\
say حَمْرَاوَاتٌ, like as one does not say أَحْمَرُونَ:<br>\
(IB:) and in like manner the masc. is applied to<br>\
a he-camel: (K:) or دَكَّآءُ [in the sense here explained] has no masc., and therefore it is allowable to say دَكَّاوَاتٌ. (IB.)<br>\
مِدَكٌ (tropical:)  A strong man, that treads the ground<br>\
vehemently: (S, TA:) or strong to work; (K;)<br>\
and the fem., with ة, is applied in this latter sense<br>\
