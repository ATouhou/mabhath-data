[for the purpose of testing its sonorific quality]:<br>\
the arrow does not thus turn, nor does it produce the<br>\
kind of sound termed حَنِين, unless in consequence of the hardness of its wood, and its goodly<br>\
straightness, and its compact make. (AHn.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
دَرَّ also signifies It (a thing) was, or became, soft,<br>\
tender, or supple. (IAar, K.)<br>\

being دَرِرْتَ,] and, if so, the aor. is not extr.,<br>\
(MF,) It (a man&#39;s face) became goodly after<br>\
disease. (K.)<br>\

دَرْدَرَ, (inf. n. دَرْدَرَةٌ, TK,) He (a child,<br>\
S) chewed, or mumbled, an unripe date (S, K)<br>\
with his toothless gums. (TA.) Hence the saying of a certain Arab, to whom El-Asma&#39;ee had<br>\
come, أَتَيْتَنِى وَ أَنَا أُدَرْدِرُ [Thou camest to me when<br>\
I was a child mumbling with toothless gums: or<br>\
it may mean thou hast come to me when I am<br>\
old, mumbling &amp;c.: see دُرْدُرٌ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
He (a man) lost his teeth, and their sockets<br>\
became apparent. (TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَدَرْدَرَ It (a thing) was, or became, in<br>\
a state of motion or commotion, or it moved<br>\
about. (T in art. دل.) And تَدَرْدَرَتِ اللَّحْمَةُ The<br>\

of a woman, تَدَرْدَرُ, [for تَتَدَرْدَرُ,] meaning She<br>\
quivers in her buttocks, by reason of their largeness, when she walks. (TA.)<br>\
دَرٌّ an inf. n. used as a subst., (Msb,) Milk;<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K;) as also ↓ دِرَّةٌ. (K.) Hence,<br>\

And أُمَّهَاتُ الدَّرِّ The teats of a camel or clovenfooted animal. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence also the saying,<br>\
لِلّٰهِ دَرُّكَ (tropical:)  To God be attributed the good that hath<br>\
proceeded from thee! or thy good deed! (TA:)<br>\
or thy deed: (A:) or thy gift! and what is received from thee! [and thy flow of eloquence!<br>\
and the like: when said to an eloquent speaker or<br>\
poet, it may be rendered divinely art thou gifted!]<br>\
a man&#39;s gift [or the like] was originally thus<br>\
likened to the milk of a camel; and then this<br>\
phrase became so common as to be used as expressive of admiration of anything: (Aboo-Bekr,<br>\
TA:) it was first said by a man who saw another<br>\
milking camels, and wondered at the abundance<br>\
of their milk: (ISd, TA:) the thing alluded to<br>\
therein is attributed to God to indicate that none<br>\
other could be its author. (TA.) You say also,<br>\
لِلّٰهِ دَرُّهُ (tropical:)  To God be attributed his deed! (S, K:)<br>\
or his knowledge! or his good! or bounty! or<br>\
beneficence! (Har p. 418:) [&amp;c.:] meaning<br>\
praise. (S.) Accord. to IAar, دَرٌّ signifies (tropical:)  A<br>\
deed, whether good or evil. (TA.) Ibn-Ahmar<br>\
says, لِلّٰهِ دَرِّى [To God be attributed what hath<br>\
brought me to this state!] wondering at himself.<br>\
(TA.) One also says, لِلّٰهِ دَرُّكَ مِنْ رَجُلٍ, which is<br>\
likewise an expression of praise, (S,) meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  To God be attributed the goodness, or good<br>\
action, of thee, as a man! [i. e., of such a man<br>\
as thou!] (TA.) And لِلّٰهِ دَرُّهُ فَارِسًا (tropical:)  [To God be<br>\
attributed his excellence as a horseman!]. (Msb.)<br>\
And, in dispraise, (S,) دَرُّهُ ↓ لَا دَرَّ May his good,<br>\
or wealth, not be, or become, much, or abundant!<br>\
(S, A, TA:) or may his work not thrive! (K.)<br>\
El-Mutanakhkhil says,<br>\
لَا دَرَّ دَرِّىَ إِنْ أَطْعَمْتُ نَازِلَهُمْ<br>\
قِرْفَ الحَتِّىِ وَعِنْدِى البُرُّ مَكْنُوزُ<br>\
[May my wealth not become abundant, or may<br>\
my work not thrive, if I feed him among them<br>\
who is a guest with the rind of حَتِىّ (q. v.) when<br>\
I have wheat stored up]: this verse is cited by<br>\
Fr, who also mentions the phrase, دَرَّ دَرُّ فُلَانٍ<br>\
[May the wealth of such a one become abundant!<br>\
or may his work thrive!]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The<br>\
soul; syn. نَفْسٌ. (K.) One says رَجُلٌ سَرِىٌّ الدَّرِّ<br>\
A man of generous and manly soul. (TK.) And<br>\
دَفَعَ اللّٰهُ عَنْ دَرِّهِ May God defend his soul. (Lh.)<br>\
دُرٌّ and دُرَرٌ (S, Msb, K) and دُرَّاتٌ (K) pls., (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) or rather the first is a coll. gen. n., and<br>\
the second and third are pls., (MF,) of ↓ دُرَّهٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) which last signifies A pearl: (S:) or a<br>\
large pearl. (Msb, K.)<br>\
دَرَّةٌ: see دِرَّةٌ.<br>\
دُرَّةٌ: see دُرٌّ.<br>\
دِرَّةٌ: see دَرٌّ, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Copious, or<br>\
abundant, flowing milk; milk flowing copiously,<br>\
or abundantly: (TA:) and a flow, or stream,<br>\
or a flowing or streaming, of milk; (S,<br>\
K;) and its abundance or abounding: (S, Msb,<br>\
K:) as also ↓ دَرَّةٌ: (L:) or this latter signifies a<br>\
single flow, or stream, of milk. (Msb.) Hence<br>\
the prov., لَا آتِيكَ مَااخْتَلَفَتِ الدِّرَّةُ وَالجِرَّةُ I will<br>\
not come to thee as long as the flow of milk and<br>\
the cud go [the former] downwards and [the<br>\

-b3-<br>\
[Hence also the phrase,] لِلسَّحَابِ دِرَّةٌ (assumed tropical:)  The clouds<br>\
have a pouring forth: pl. دِرَرٌ. (S.) En-Nemir<br>\
Ibn-Towlab says,<br>\
وَرَحْمَتُهُ وَسَمَآءٌ دِرَرْ  سَلَامُ الإِلَاهِ وَرَيْحَانُهُ<br>\
meaning ذَاتُ دِرَرٍ [i. e. The peace, or security, &amp;c.,<br>\
of God, and his bounty, and his mercy, and a sky<br>\
pouring forth showers]. (S.) Some say that دِرَرٌ<br>\
signifies ↓ دَارٌّ [flowing, or streaming; or flowing,<br>\
or streaming, copiously, or abundantly]; like as<br>\
قِيَمًا in the Kur vi. 162 signifies قَائِمًا. (TA.)<br>\
In like manner one says also دِيَمٌ دِرَرٌ [Lasting<br>\
and still rains pouring down]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
لِلسُّوقِ دِرَّةٌ (assumed tropical:)  The market has a brisk traffic going<br>\

whip: (Msb:) [app. a whip for flogging criminals; as seems to be implied in the TA: I<br>\
have not found any Arab who can describe it in<br>\
the present day: it seems to have been a kind of<br>\
whip, or scourge, of twisted cords or thongs, used<br>\
for punishment and in sport, such as is now called<br>\
فِرْقِلَّة: or a whip made of a strip, or broad strip,<br>\
(see 1 in art. خفق,) of thick and tough hide, or<br>\
the like: it is described by Golius and Freytag<br>\
(by the latter as from the S and K, in neither of<br>\
which is any such explanation found,) as “ strophium ex fune aliave re contortum, aut nervus<br>\
taurinus, similisve res, quibus percuti solet: ”]<br>\

which is a humour that becomes بَقّ [i. e. bugs<br>\
