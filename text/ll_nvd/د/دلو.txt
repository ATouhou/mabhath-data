دَلَا الدَّلْوَ, (Mgh, K, [in the CK, دَلّاها is<br>\
erroneously put for دَلَاهَا,]) [and دَلَا بِالدَّلْوِ,] first<br>\
pers. دَلَوْتُ الدَّلْوَ, (T, S, Msb,) and دَلَوْتُ بِالدَّلْوِ,<br>\
(Msb,) aor., first pers., أَدْلُو, inf. n. دَلْوٌ; (T;) and<br>\
الدَّلْوَ ↓ ادلى; (Mgh; [the only authority that I<br>\
find for the latter verb in the sense here explained;]) He pulled the دَلْو [or bucket] up, or<br>\
out, (T, S, Mgh, Msb,) from the well, (T, Mgh,)<br>\
full: (T, Mgh:) or he pulled the دلو to make it<br>\
come forth. (K.) Hence, i. e. from ادلى الدلو<br>\
as explained above, the saying, in a trad., if it be<br>\
correct, عَنِ المَآءَ ↓ وَرَدُوا مَآءٍ فَسَأَلُوا أَهْلَهُ أَنْ يُدْلُوهُمْ<br>\
[They came to water, and they asked its owners<br>\
to draw for them from the water]; for يُدْلُوا لَهُمْ,<br>\
or يُدْلُوا دَلْوَهُمْ. (Mgh.) And أَدْلُو حَاجَتِى, from<br>\
دَلَوْتُ الدَّلْوَ explained above, means (assumed tropical:)  I seek, or<br>\
demand, the accomplishment of my want: (Ham<br>\
p. 500:) or دَلَا حَاجَتَهُ means (assumed tropical:)  He sought, or<br>\
demanded, the object of his want. (TA.) And<br>\
دَلَوْتُ بِفُلَانٍ إِلَيْكَ, (S, TA,) inf. n. as above, (TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  I begged, or beg, such a one to make intercession<br>\
for me to thee. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence also,] دَلَا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He drove, or urged on: (IAar, T:) or did so<br>\
gently; for دَلْوٌ [the inf. n.] means the driving, or<br>\
urging on, gently. (M.) You say, دَلَوْتُ النَّاقَةَ,<br>\
(S, K,) aor. أَدْلُو, (TA,) inf. n. دَلْوٌ, (S, TA,) (tropical:)  I<br>\
made the she-camel to go gently, or leisurely.<br>\
(S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And دَلَوْتُهُ and ↓ دَالَيْتُهُ (tropical:)  I was<br>\
gentle with him; namely, a man; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
treated him with gentleness or blandishment,<br>\
soothed him, coaxed him, or wheedled him;<br>\
(S, TA; and K in art. دلى [in which, as is said<br>\
in the TK, دَاوَيْتُهُ is erroneously put, in some<br>\
copies, for دَارَيْتُهُ];) endeavoured to conciliate<br>\
him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 4, in three places.<br>\
2<br>\
تَدْلِيَةٌ [inf. n. of دلّى] signifies The lowering<br>\
a thing; like ↓ إِدْلَآءٌ [inf. n. of 4]. (Bd in vii.<br>\
21.) You say, دلّى الشَّىْءَ فِى مَهْوَاةٍ He let down<br>\
the thing, made it to hang down, or let it fall,<br>\
into a pit or the like. (T, * M, TA.) And<br>\
دَلَّاهُ مِنْ سَطْحٍ بِحَبْلٍ He let him, or it, down from<br>\
a house-top by means of a rope. (Mgh.) And<br>\
دلّى رِجْلَيْهِ مِنَ السَّرِيرِ [He hung down his legs<br>\
from the couch]; and ↓ ادلى occurs in the same<br>\
sense. (Mgh.) It is said in a trad., دُلِّىَ عَلَىَّ<br>\
جِرَابٌ مِنْ شَحْمٍ مِنْ بَعْضِ حُصُونِ خَيْبَرَ, meaning<br>\
[A bag, or provision-bag, of fat] was let down,<br>\
or let fall, upon me [from one of the forts of<br>\
Kheyber]. (Mgh.) See also 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  And دلّى الشَّىْءَ<br>\
He made, or brought, or drew, the thing near to<br>\
another thing (مِنْ غَيْرِهِ); like الدَّلْوِ ↓ إِدْلَآءُ. (Har<br>\
p. 173.) ―<br>\
-b3-  دَلَّاهُ بِغُرُورٍ (assumed tropical:)  He caused him to fall<br>\
into that which he desired [to bring about] by<br>\
exposing him to perdition, or destruction, or loss,<br>\
without his knowledge; from الدَّلْوِ ↓ إِدْلَآءُ. (S.)<br>\
[In the Kur vii. 21,] فَدَلَّاهُمَا بِغُرُورٍ means (assumed tropical:)  And<br>\
he caused them to fall (فدلّاهما) into disobedience<br>\
by deceiving, or beguiling, them: so says Aboo-Is-hák [Zj]: or (assumed tropical:)  he excited their cupidity [with<br>\
deceit, or guile]; originating from the case of a<br>\
thirsty man&#39;s being let down (يُدَلَّى) into a well<br>\
in order that he may satisfy his thirst from its<br>\
water, and his not finding water in it, so that he<br>\
is let down into it with deceit, or guile: or it<br>\
means he emboldened them to eat of the tree with<br>\
deceit, or guile; originally دَلَّلَهُمَا. (T.)<br>\
3<br>\
دَالَيْتُهُ: see 1.<br>\
4<br>\
أَدْلَيْتُ, [in the CK, erroneously, دَلَيْتُ,] and<br>\
↓ دَلَوْتُ (K;) or أَدْلَيْتُ الدَّلْوَ, (T, S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) inf. n. إِدْلَآءٌ; (T, Msb;) and الدَّلْوَ ↓ دَلَوْتُ,<br>\
[and app. بِالدَّلْوِ,] aor. أَدْلُو, [inf. n. دَلْوٌ;] (T, *<br>\
Msb;) I let down the دَلْو [or bucket] (T, S, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K) into the well, (T, S, Mgh, K,)<br>\
to fill it, (T,) or to draw water with it. (M,<br>\
Msb.) أَدْلِ دَلْوَكَ فِى الدِّلَآءِ [Let down thy bucket<br>\
with the other buckets] is a prov. used in urging<br>\
[a person] to strive, or labour, for gain; (TA;)<br>\
originating from a company&#39;s assembling at a<br>\
well, and letting down their buckets in order that<br>\
every one of them may take his share of the<br>\
water, or what is easily procurable by him thereof:<br>\
meaning, use means to acquire, like as do others.<br>\
(Har p. 167.) See also 2, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, (Mgh,) ادلى بِحُجَّتِهِ (tropical:)  He adduced his<br>\
plea, or the like, (T, S, M, Mgh, K,) correctly,<br>\
or validly; (T;) or he defended himself by<br>\
adducing it or urging it: (S:) or he established<br>\
his plea, or the like, and so obtained his claim or<br>\
demand or suit. (Msb.) And in like manner you<br>\
say, ادلى بِحَقِّهِ (tropical:)  [He urged, or established, his<br>\
right or due]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And ادلى بِمَالِهِ (tropical:)  He<br>\
gave, (دَفَعَ, M, K, TA,) or presented, or offered,<br>\
(رَفَعَ, S, TA,) his property, (S, M, K, TA,)<br>\
إِلَيْهِ [to him], (M,) or الى الحَاكِمَ [to the judge].<br>\
(S.) Hence, in the Kur [ii. 184], وَتُدْلُوا بِهَا إِلَى,<br>\
الحُكَّامِ, (S, K,) i. e. (tropical:)  And [do not] give it, or<br>\
offer it, as a bribe to the judges: (S, * TA:) or<br>\
and do not endeavour to conciliate with it the<br>\
judges in order that they may cut off for you what<br>\
is the right of others: (T:) or and do not throw<br>\
it to the judges to be decided by them, (Mgh,<br>\
Bd, Jel,) or as a bribe. (Jel.) And in a letter of<br>\
&#39;Omar, فَافْهَمْ إِذَا أُدْلِىَ إِلَيْكَ And understand thou<br>\
when an application is made to thee by litigants<br>\
for the decision of a cause. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
ادلى بِرَحِمِهِ (tropical:)  He sought to bring himself near, to<br>\
approach, or to gain access, [إِلَى غَيْرِهِ to another,]<br>\
by means of his relationship: (S, K, TA:) and<br>\
he pleaded, or made intercession, thereby. (TA.)<br>\
بِهِ إِلَيْكَ ↓ وَقَدْ دَلَوْنَا, in a prayer for rain, of &#39;Omar,<br>\
referring to El-&#39; Abbás, i. e., accord. to the<br>\
“ Ghareebeyn,” (assumed tropical:)  And we have sought to approach, or to gain access, to Thee by him, app.<br>\
means that they sought to obtain the mercy and<br>\
aid of God [by means of his intercession], like as<br>\
one seeks to get at, or obtain, the water by means<br>\
of the دَلْو [or bucket]. (M.) One says also,<br>\
أَدْلَى إِلَى المَيَّتِ بِالبُنُوَّةِ وَنَحْوِهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
was united to the dead by sonship, and the like;<br>\
from إِدْلَآءُ الدَّلْوِ. (Msb.) And فُلَانٌ يُدْلِى إِلَى<br>\
المَيِّتِ بِذَكِرٍ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is united with the dead<br>\
by a male. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b5-  ادلى فِيهِ means (tropical:)  He said<br>\
of him what was evil, or foul. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And<br>\
ادلى said of a horse &amp;c., He put forth his yard,<br>\
for the purpose of staling or covering; (M, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ دلّى said of an ass, as is also the former<br>\
verb. (M.) ―<br>\
-b7-  See also 1, first and second<br>\
sentences.<br>\
5<br>\
تدلّى It was let down or lowered; it hung<br>\
down, or dangled; it was let down; (T, * M,<br>\
Mgh;) into, and over, a pit or the like; (M;) it<br>\
hung (K) from (مِنْ) a tree; (S, K) it hung down<br>\
as a fruit [from a tree]. (Bd in liii. 8.) [Hence,]<br>\
تدلّى عَلَيْنَا مِنْ أَرْضِ كَذَا [He, or it, came down,<br>\
or descended, upon us from such a land]. (TA.)<br>\
And تدلّى بِالشَّرِّ He descended upon one with evil,<br>\
or mischief. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He drew near, or<br>\
approached: (K in art. دلى:) or he drew near,<br>\
or approached, [from above, or] after being high.<br>\
(IAar, T.) Accord. to Fr, ثُمَّ دَنَا فَتَدَلَّى [in the<br>\
Kur liii. 8] means ثَمَّ تَدَلَّى فَدَنَا, (T,) i. e. Then<br>\
he (Gabriel) hung down from the highest region<br>\
of the sky, and so drew near to the Apostle:<br>\
showing that he took him up without becoming<br>\
separated from his place: or the meaning of the<br>\
phrase, as it stands, is, then he drew near to the<br>\
Prophet, and he clung to him: (Bd:) but accord.<br>\
to Zj, it means then he drew near, and drew<br>\
nearer; and is like the phrase دَنَا فُلَانٌ مِنِّى وَقَرُبَ.<br>\
(T. [See also another explanation in what follows.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He was, or became, lowly,<br>\
humble, or submissive; or he lowered, humbled,<br>\
or abased, himself. (IAar, T; and K in art.<br>\
دلى.) ―<br>\
-b4-  In the saying of a poet,<br>\
كَأَنَ رَاكِبَهَا غُصْنٌ بِمَرْوَحَةٍ<br>\
إِذَا تَدَلَّتْ بِهِ أَوْ شَارِبٌ ثَمِلٌ<br>\
تدلّت may be quasi-pass. of دَلَا, inf. n. دَلْوٌ, signifying “ he drove, or urged on, gently: ” or it<br>\
may be for تَدَلَّلَتْ: [so that the meaning may<br>\
be, As though her rider were a branch of a<br>\
tree in a place over which the wind was blowing,<br>\
when she became urged on gently with him, or<br>\
an intoxicated drinker: or, when she emboldened<br>\
herself with him, &amp;c.:] (M:) [for] تَدَلَّى is also<br>\
syn. with تَدَلَّلَ: (S, K:) and [J says that] this<br>\
is its meaning in the saying in the Kur [otherwise explained above] ثُمَّ دَنَا فَتَدَلَّى: being like<br>\
يَتَمَطَّى in the Kur [lxxv. 33], i. e. يَتَمَطَّطُ. (S.)<br>\
12<br>\
اِدْلَوْلَى, of the measure اِفْعَوْعَلَ, He hastened,<br>\
made haste, sped, or went quickly; (S;) [like<br>\
اذلولى.]<br>\
دَلًا: see what next follows.<br>\
دَلْوٌ [A bucket, generally of leather;] a certain<br>\
thing with which one draws water; (S, TA;) a<br>\
vessel with which one draws water from a well;<br>\
(KL;) well known; (T, K;) in Pers. دول [i. e.<br>\
دُولْ, pronounced “ dól ”]: (MA:) masc. and<br>\
fem.; (M;) sometimes masc.; (K;) mostly<br>\
fem., (M, Msb,) and thus accord. to the more<br>\
approved usage: (M:) pl. (of pauc., T, S, Msb)<br>\
أَدْلٍ, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) of the measure أَفْعُلٌ,<br>\
[originally أَدْلُوٌ,] (S,) and (of mult., T, * S, Msb)<br>\
دِلَآءٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and دُلِىٌّ, (S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
which is of the measure فُعُولٌ (S, Msb) originally,<br>\
(Msb,) and دِلِىٌّ (T, M, K, omitted in the CK)<br>\
and دُلِيَّةٌ, omitted here by the author of the K but<br>\
mentioned by him in art. نحو, (TA,) and ↓ دَلَا;<br>\
(K; [there said to be like عَلَى; but correctly<br>\
دَلًا;]) or دَلًا is syn. with دِلَآءٌ, and its sing. [or<br>\
n. un.] is ↓ دَلَاةٌ; (S, M;) like as that of فَلًا is<br>\
فَلَاةٌ; (M;) [for] دَلَاةٌ is syn. with دَلْوٌ: (T:) or<br>\
دَلَاةٌ signifies, (K,) or signifies also, (M,) a small<br>\
دَلْو. (M, K. [But in the M, in one place, it<br>\
seems to be stated that, accord. to some, دَلَاةٌ and<br>\
دَلًا signify the same, in a pl. sense: for, after the<br>\
pls. of دَلْوٌ, it is added, وَهِىَ الدَّلَاةُ وَالدَّلَا. I think,<br>\
however, that he who first said this meant<br>\
thereby that الدَّلَاةُ and الدَّلَا signify, respectively,<br>\
the same as الدَّلْوُ and الدِّلَآءُ &amp;c.]) [Hence the<br>\
saying, أَتْبِعِ الدَّلْوَ رِشَآءَهَا: see 4 in art. تبع.] As<br>\
masc., it has for its dim. ↓ دُلَّىٌّ: as fem., ↓ دُلَيَّةٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) See also دَالِيَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (M,) الدَّلْوُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [The sign of Aquarius;] one of the signs of the<br>\
Zodiac. (S, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  The hopper of a<br>\
mill. (Golius on the authority of Meyd.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And (assumed tropical:)  A certain mark made with a hot iron<br>\
upon camels; (S, K;) app. in the form of a دَلْو<br>\
[properly so called]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  Calamity,<br>\
misfortune, or mischief. (S, K.) So in the saying, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِالدَّلْوِ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one brought calamity, &amp;c.]. (S.)<br>\
دَلَاةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A share, or portion: so in the saying<br>\
of a rájiz,<br>\
آلَيْتُ لَا أُعْطِىَ غُلَامًا أَبَدَا<br>\
دَلَاتَهُ إِنِّى أُحِبُّ الأَسْوَدَا<br>\
meaning [I have sworn, or, emphatically, I<br>\
swear, I will not give a boy, ever,] his share, or<br>\
portion, of love, or affection: [verily I love ElAswad:] El-Aswad was the name of his son.<br>\
(S, TA.)<br>\
دُلَىٌّ: see دَلْوٌ, of which they are dims.<br>\
دُلَيَّةٌ: see دَلْوٌ, of which they are dims.<br>\
دَالٍ Pulling up, or out, a دَلْو [or bucket] from<br>\
a well: (T:) and occurring in poetry in the<br>\
sense of مُدْلٍ [meaning letting down a دَلْو into a<br>\
well]: (S:) pl. دُلَاةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
دَالِيَةٌ A [water-wheel, or machine for irrigating land, such as is called] مَنْجَنُون, (S, M, K,)<br>\
that is turned by an ox or a cow: (S:) and<br>\
[such as is called] a نَاعُورَة: (K:) or the ناعورة is<br>\
turned by water: (S:) and a thing made of<br>\
palm-leaves (M, K) and pieces of wood, with<br>\
which water is drawn [for irrigating land] by<br>\
means of ropes, or cords, (M,) [app. held and<br>\
drawn at one end by a man, and at the other<br>\
end] tied to a tall palm-trunk: (M, K:) it is a<br>\
bucket (دَلْو), and the like, with pieces of wood<br>\
made in the form of a cross, [i. e. with two<br>\
pieces of wood placed across and so tied together,]<br>\
the two arms of which are bound to the top [or<br>\
rim] of the bucket; them one end of a rope is<br>\
tied to it, and the other end to a palm-trunk<br>\
standing at the head of the well; and one irrigates [land] with it [app. by drawing and swinging it up by means of another, or of the same,<br>\
rope]: the word is of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ in the<br>\
sense of the measure مَفْعُولَةٌ [because it is pulled<br>\
up]: the pl. is دَوَالٍ: El-Fárábee deviates from<br>\
others, by explaining it as meaning a مَنْجَنُون;<br>\
and J follows him: (Msb:) [a similar apparatus<br>\
for irrigating land is used in the northern parts<br>\
of Egypt, called قَطْوَة and ↓ دَلْو: it consists of<br>\
a bowl-shaped bucket, with four cords attached<br>\
to its rim: two men, each holding two of the<br>\
cords, throw up the water by means of it into<br>\
a trough or trench: accord. to Mtr,] the دَالِيَة is<br>\
a tall palm-trunk set in the manner of the machine<br>\
with which rice is beaten [to remove the husks],<br>\
having at its head a large bowl, with which<br>\
water is drawn [for irrigating land]. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also Land that is irrigated by means of the<br>\
دَلْو [or bucket] or the [machine called] مَنْجَنُون<br>\
[mentioned above]. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And the pl.,<br>\
دَوَالٍ, Unripe dates hung, and eaten when they<br>\
become ripe. (T, K.) Hung fruit. (Bd in liii. 8.<br>\
[But perhaps الثمر is there a mistranscription<br>\
for التّمْرُ.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (i. e. the pl.) Black grapes,<br>\
but not intensely black, (AHn, M, K,) the bunches<br>\
of which are the largest of all bunches, appearing<br>\
like goats hung [upon the vines]: the berries<br>\
thereof are coarse, breaking in the mouth, and<br>\
round; and are dried. (AHn, M.) [See also<br>\
دَوَالِىُّ, in art. دوال.) ―<br>\

grape-vine itself: and a shoot of a grape-vine:<br>\
pl. as above.]<br>\
