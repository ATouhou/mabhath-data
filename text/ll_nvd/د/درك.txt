دَرَكَ, from which should be derived دَرَاكِ and<br>\
دَرَّاكٌ, is unused, though its noun درك [i. e. دَرْكٌ<br>\
or دَرَكٌ, which latter (the more common of the<br>\
two) see below,] is used. (IB.) [دَرَكَ in Golius&#39;s<br>\
Lex. is evidently a mistranscription for دَارَكَ.]<br>\
2<br>\
تَدْرِيكٌ The dropping of rain with close consecutiveness, (IAar, K, TA,) as though one portion<br>\
thereof overtook another. (IAar, TA.) You say,<br>\
درّك المَطَرُ The rain dropped with close consecutiveness. (TK.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The hanging a rope<br>\
upon the neck of a person in coupling him with<br>\
another. (AA.)<br>\
3<br>\
دِرَاكٌ The making one part, or portion, of a<br>\
thing, (K, TA,) whatever it be, (TA,) to follow<br>\
another uninterruptedly; (K, TA;) as also<br>\
مُدَارَكَةٌ: (TA:) both [are inf. ns. of دارك, and]<br>\
signify the same [i. e. the continuing, or carrying<br>\
on, a thing uninterruptedly]: (S:) مُدَارَكَةٌ is<br>\
when there are no intervals between things following one another; like مُوَاصَلَةٌ: otherwise it<br>\
is مُوَاتَرَةٌ. (S and K in art. وتر.) You say, of a<br>\
man, دارك صَوْتَهُ He continued his voice uninterruptedly. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A horse&#39;s overtaking, or coming up with, wild animals (K, TA)<br>\
&amp;c. (TA.) You say, of a horse, دارك الوَحْشَ,<br>\
inf. n. دِرَاكٌ, He overtook, or come up with, the<br>\
wild animals. (TK.) [Thus it is syn. with ادرك.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  In the saying, لَا بَارَكَ اللّٰهُ فِيهِ وَلَا دَارَكَ,<br>\
(S, K, * TA,) it is an imitative sequent: (K, TA:)<br>\
all these verbs have one and the same meaning.<br>\
(S, TA. [See تَارَكَ.])<br>\
4<br>\
ادركهُ, (S Msb, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. إِدْرَاكٌ (S,<br>\
Msb) and مُدْرَكٌ, (Msb,) He, or it, attained,<br>\
reached, overtook, or came up with, him, or it:<br>\
(S, K, TA:) or sought, or pursued, and attained,<br>\
reached, &amp;c., him, or it: (Msb:) [داركهُ, also,<br>\
signifies the same, as shown above:] and ↓ تداركهُ,<br>\
likewise, [of which اِدَّراَكَهُ is a variation,] is syn.<br>\
with ادركهُ; (Jel in lxviii. 49, and KL, * and<br>\
TA; *) and so is ↓ اِدَّرَكَهُ. (TA.) You say,<br>\
أَدْرَكْتُ الرَّجُلَ and ↓ اِدَّرَكْتُهُ [I attained, reached,<br>\
overtook, or came up with, the man]. (IJ,<br>\
TA.) And مَشَيْتُ حَتَّى أَدْرَكْتُهُ I walked, or<br>\
went on foot, until I overtook him, or came up<br>\
with him. (S, TA.) And عِشْتُ حَتَّى أَدْرَكْتُ زَمَانَهُ<br>\
I lived until I attained, or reached, his time.<br>\
(S, TA.) And أَدْرَكْتُ الفَائِتَ [I attained, &amp;c.,<br>\
that which was passing away]. (Mgh.) And<br>\
ادركهُ بِمَكْرُوهٍ [He overtook him, or visited him,<br>\
with some displeasing, or abominable, or evil,<br>\
action]. (M and K in art. وتر. See also 6, in the<br>\
latter half of the paragraph, in two places: and<br>\
see 10, first sentence.) And أَدْرَكَنِى الجَهْدُ [Difficulty, or distress, &amp;c., overtook me, ensued to<br>\
me, or came upon me]; a phrase similar to بَلَغَنِى<br>\
الكِبَرُ in the Kur [iii. 35]: and so أَدْرَكْتُ الجَهْدَ<br>\
[I came to experience difficulty, &amp;c.]; like بَلَغْتُ<br>\
مِنَ الكِبَرِ عُتِيًا in the Kur [xix. 9]. (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA in art. بلغ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, He attained, obtained, or acquired, it; and so ↓ تداركهُ, as is<br>\
shown in the KL; so too ادرك بِهِ, for one says,]<br>\
ادرك بِدَمِهِ [He obtained revenge, or retaliation,<br>\
for his blood]. (S in art. وتر.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,<br>\
He perceived it; attained a knowledge of it by<br>\
any of the senses.] You say, أَدْرَكْتُهُ بِبَصَرِى [I<br>\
perceived it by my sight;] I saw it. (S, TA.)<br>\
لَا تُدْرِكُهُ الأَبْصَارُ, in the Kur [vi. 103], means,<br>\
accord. to some, The eyes [perceive him not]:<br>\
accord. to others, the mental perception comprehendeth not [or attaineth not the knowledge of]<br>\
the real nature of his hallowed essence. (TA.)<br>\
You say also, ادرك عِلْمِى, meaning My knowledge comprehended that such a thing was a fact.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence likewise, as an intrans. v., or a<br>\
trans. v. of which the objective complement is<br>\
understood,] ادرك also signifies [He attained a<br>\
knowledge of the uttermost of a thing; or] his<br>\
knowledge attained the uttermost of a thing.<br>\
(TA.) See also 6, in the former half of the paragraph, in two places. ―<br>\
-b5-  Also It (a thing)<br>\
attained its proper time: (Msb, K:) it attained<br>\
its final time or state, or its utmost point or<br>\
degree. (K.) [He (a boy, and a beast,) attained<br>\
his perfect, ripe, or mature, state; and in like<br>\
manner ادركت is said of a girl: or it is like ادرك<br>\
as meaning] he (a boy) attained to puberty, (S,<br>\
Msb,) or to the utmost term of youth. (TA.)<br>\
It (fruit) attained to ripeness, or maturity;<br>\
became ripe, or mature; (S Msb;) attained its<br>\
time, and its utmost degree of ripeness or maturity.<br>\
(T, TA.) And ادركت القِدْرُ The cooking-pot<br>\
attained its proper time [for the cooking of its<br>\
contents]. (TA.) And ادركت الخَمْرُ [The wine<br>\
became mature]. (Msb and K in art. خمر.) And<br>\
ادرك مَآءُ الرَّكِيَّةِ The water of the well reached its<br>\
دَرَك, i. e. its bottom (Aboo-&#39; Adnán, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also<br>\
It passed away and came to an end; came to<br>\
nought; became exhausted; or failed entirely:<br>\
(S, K:) said in this sense of flour, or meal: (S:)<br>\
and thus it has been explained as used in the<br>\
Kur [xxvii. 68], where it is said, [accord. to one<br>\
reading,] بَلْ أَدْرَكَ عِلْمُهُمْ فِى الآخِرَةِ [Nay, their<br>\
knowledge hath entirely failed respecting the<br>\
world to come]. (TA. [See also 6.]) Sh mentions this signification as heard by him on no<br>\
other authority than that of Lth; and Az asserts<br>\
it to be incorrect: but it has been authorized by<br>\
more than one of the leading lexicologists, and<br>\
the language of the Arabs does not forbid it; for<br>\
it is said of flour, or meal, and in this case can<br>\
only mean it came to its end, and entirely failed,<br>\
or became exhausted; and fruits, when they are<br>\
ripe (إِذَا أَدْرَكْتْ) are exposed to coming to<br>\
nought, and so is everything that has attained to<br>\
its extreme term; so that the signification of<br>\
“ coming to nought ” is one of the necessary<br>\
adjuncts of the meaning of إِدْرَاكٌ. (TA.) [In<br>\
like manner,] ↓ اِدَّرَكَ signifies It (a thing) continued uninterruptedly and then come to nought:<br>\
(IJ, TA:) and agreeably with this signification<br>\
is explained the saying in the Kur [xxvi. 61],<br>\
إِنَّا لَمُدَّرِكُونَ [Verily we are coming to nought,<br>\
by those who read thus instead of لَمُدْرَكُونَ being<br>\
overtaken]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  You say also, ادرك الثَّمَنُ<br>\
المُشْتَرِىَ, meaning [The payment of] the price<br>\
was, or became, obligatory on the purchaser:<br>\
this is an ideal reaching, or overtaking. (Msb.)<br>\
6<br>\
تدّاركوا i. q. تلاحقوا (S) [i. e.] They attained, reached, overtook, or came up with, one<br>\
another; as also اِدَّارَكُوا, and ↓ اِدَّرَكُوا; (Sh,<br>\
TA;) [or] the last of them attained, reached,<br>\
overtook, or came up with, the first of them. (S<br>\
Msb, K, TA.) Hence, in the Kur [vii. 36], (S,)<br>\
حَتَّى إِذَا ادَّارَكُوا فِيهَا جَمِيعًا [Until, when they<br>\
have overtaken one another, or have successively<br>\
arrived, therein, all together]: originally تَدَارَكُوا.<br>\
(S, K. *) And تدارك الثَّرِيَانَ [The two moistures<br>\
reached each other; (like اِلْتَقَى الثَّرَيَانِ;) meaning] the moisture of the rain reached the moisture<br>\
of the earth. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] تدارك signifies [It continued, or was carried on, uninterruptedly; it was closely consecutive in its<br>\
parts, or portions;] one part, or portion, of it,<br>\
followed, or was made to follow, another uninterruptedly; said of anything. (TA.) You say,<br>\
تدارك السَّيْرُ [The course, or pace, or journeying,<br>\
continued uninterruptedly]. (S and TA in art.<br>\
حفد, &amp;c.) And تداركت الأَخْبَارُ The tidings<br>\
followed one another closely. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,<br>\
when said of knowledge, meaning, accord. to Fr,<br>\
It continued unbroken in its sequence or concatenation.] بَلِ ادَّرَاكَ عِلْمُهُمْ فِى الآخِرَةِ (K, TA,)<br>\
in the Kur [xxvii. 68], (TA,) [virtually] means<br>\
Nay, they have no knowledge respecting the world<br>\
to come: (K, TA:) or, as IJ says, their knowledge is hasty, and slight, and not on a sure footing, &amp;c.: Az says that AA read بَلْ أَدْرَكَ [of<br>\
which an explanation has been given above (see<br>\
4)]: that I&#39;Ab is related to have read ↓ بَلَىآأَدْرَكَ<br>\
[&amp;c., i. e. Yea, hath their knowledge reached its<br>\
end &amp;c.?], as interrogatory, and without tesh-deed: and that, accord. to the reading بل ادّراك<br>\
Fr says that the proper meaning is, [Nay,] hath<br>\
their knowledge continued unbroken so as to<br>\
extend to the knowledge of the world to come,<br>\
whether it will be or not be? wherefore is added,<br>\
بَلْ هُمْ فِى شَكٍّ مِنْهَا بَلْ هُمْ مِنْهَا عَمُونَ: he says<br>\
also that Ubeí read, أَمْ تَدَارَكَ; and that the<br>\
Arabs substitute بَلْ for أَمْ, and أَمْ for بَلْ, when<br>\
a passage begins with an interrogation: but this<br>\
explanation of Fr is not clear; the meaning is<br>\
[said to be] their knowledge shall be unbroken<br>\
and concurrent [respecting the world to come]<br>\
when the resurrection shall have become a manifest event, and they shall have found themselves<br>\
to be losers; and the truth of that wherewith<br>\
they have been threatened shall appear to them<br>\
when their knowledge thereof will not profit<br>\
them: accord. to Aboo-Mo&#39;ádh the Grammarian,<br>\
the readings ↓ بَلْ أَدْرَكَ &amp;c. and بَلِ ادَّارَكَ &amp;c.<br>\
mean the same; i. e. they shall know in the<br>\
world to come; like the saying in the Kur<br>\
[xix. 39], أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ, &amp;c.: and Es-Suddee<br>\
says of both these readings that the meaning is,<br>\
their knowledge shall agree, or be in unison, in<br>\
the world to come; i. e. they shall know in the<br>\
world to come that that wherewith they have been<br>\
threatened is true: or, accord. to Mujáhid, the<br>\
meaning of بَلِ ادَّارَكَ عِلْمُهُمْ &amp;c. is said to be, is<br>\
their knowledge concurrent respecting the world<br>\
to come? بل being here used in the sense of أَم:<br>\
(TA:) or it may mean their knowledge hath gone<br>\
on uninterruptedly until it hath become cut short;<br>\
from the phrase تدارك بَنُو فُلَانٍ meaning The sons<br>\
of such a one went on uninterruptedly into destruction. (Bd.)<br>\
-A2-  تداركهُ: see 4, in two places.<br>\
It is used in the [primary] sense of أَدْرَكَهُ in the<br>\
saying in the Kur [lxviii. 49], لَوْ لَا أَنْ تَدارَكَهُ<br>\
نِعْمَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّهِ لَنُبِذَ بِالْعَرَآءِ [Had not favour (meaning mercy, Jel) from his Lord reached him, or<br>\
overtaken him, he had certainly been cast upon<br>\
the bare land]. (Jel.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, elliptically,<br>\
He overtook him, or visited him, with good, or<br>\
with evil.] El-Mutanebbee says,<br>\
أَنَ فِى أُمَّةٍ تَدَارَكَهَا اللّٰ<br>\
هُ غَرِيبٌ كَصَالِحٍ فِى ثَمُودِ<br>\
[I am among a people (may God visit them with<br>\
favour and save them from their meanness, or<br>\
visit them with destruction so that I may be safe<br>\
from them,) a stranger, like Sálih among Thamood]: تداركها اللّٰه is a prayer for the people,<br>\
meaning ادركها ↓ اللّٰه ونجّاهم من لومهم [i. e.<br>\
لُؤْمِهِمْ]: or it may be an imprecation against<br>\
them, i. e. اللّٰه بالاهلاك لِأَنْجُوَ منهم ↓ ادركهم:<br>\
[each meaning as explained above:] and IJ says<br>\
that because of this verse the poet was named<br>\
المتنبّى. (W p. 35. [The verse there commences<br>\
with أَنَا; but أَنَ is required by the metre, and is<br>\
more approved in every case except the case of a<br>\
pause.]) It is mostly used in relation to aid, or<br>\
relief, and benefaction: [so that it signifies He<br>\
aided, or relieved, him; he benefited him; he<br>\
repaired his, or its, condition; he repaired,<br>\
amended, corrected, or rectified, it:] whence the<br>\
saying of a poet,<br>\
تَدَارَكَنِى مِنْ عَثْرَةِ الدَّهْرِ قَاسِمٌ<br>\
بِمَا شَآءَ مِنْ مَعْرُوفِهِ المُتَدارِكِ<br>\
[Kásim relieved me, or has relieved me, from the<br>\
slip of fortune with what he pleased of his relieving, or continuous, beneficence]. (TA.) [See<br>\
also, in the first paragraph of art. دق, another<br>\
example, in a verse of Zuheyr, which is cited<br>\
in that art. and the present in the TA: and see<br>\
the syn. تَلَافَاهُ. Hence,] تَدَارَكْتُ مَا فَاتَ i. q.<br>\
استدركتهُ, q. v. (S, Msb, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِدَّرَكَ: see 4, first and second sentences: ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
and near the end of the paragraph: ―<br>\
-b3-  and see<br>\
also 6, first sentence.<br>\
10<br>\
استدرك الشَّىْءَ بِالشَّىءِ [properly] signifies<br>\
بِهِ ↓ حَاوَلَ إِدْرَاكَهُ [i. e. He sought, or endeavoured, to follow up the thing with the thing]:<br>\
(K:) as, for instance, الخَطَأَ بِالصَّوَابِ [the mistake with what was right]. (TK.) [Hence,] you<br>\
say, اِسْتَدْرَكْتُ مَافَاتَ [I repaired, amended, corrected, or rectified, what had passed neglected by<br>\
me, or by another; and I supplied what had so<br>\
passed, or what had escaped me, or another,<br>\
through inadvertence]; and ↓ تَدَارَكْتُهُ signifies<br>\
the same [in relation to language and to other<br>\
things; whereas the former verb is generally<br>\
restricted to relation to language or to a writer or<br>\
speaker]. (S, Msb.) You say also, استدرك عَلَيْهِ<br>\
قَوْلَهُ He corrected, or rectified, what was wrong,<br>\
or erroneous, in his saying: [but more commonly,<br>\
he supplied what he had omitted in his saying; generally meaning, what he had omitted through inadvertence: and اِسْتَدْرَكْتُهُ عَلَيْه I subjoined it, or<br>\
appended it, to what he had written, or said, by<br>\
way of emendation; or, more commonly, as a<br>\
supplement, i. e., to supply what had escaped<br>\
him, or what he had neglected:] and hence,<br>\
عَلَى البُخَارِىِّ ↓ المُسْتَدْرَكُ [The Supplement to ElBukháree; a work supplying omissions of ElBukháree;] by El-Hákim. (TA.) [Thus]<br>\
اِسْتِدْرَاكٌ signifies The annulling a presumption, or<br>\
surmise, originating from what has been before<br>\
said, [by correcting an error, or errors, or by<br>\
supplying a defect, or defects,] in a manner<br>\
resembling the making an exception. (Kull.)<br>\
[Hence حَرْفُ اسْتِدْرَاكٍ, meaning A particle of<br>\
emendation, applied to بَلْ, and to لٰكِنَّ or لٰكِنْ.]<br>\
دَرْكٌ: see the next paragraph, in eight places.<br>\
دَرَكٌ The act of attaining, reaching, or overtaking; syn. لَحَاقٌ; (K, TA; [in the CK, اللِّحاقُ<br>\
is erroneously put for اللَّحَاقُ;]) [properly an<br>\
inf. n. of the unused verb دَرَكَ (q. v.), but, having<br>\
no used verb, said to be] a noun from الإِدْرَاكُ<br>\
[with which it is syn.], (TA,) or a noun from<br>\
أَدْرَكْتُ الشَّىْءَ; as also ↓ دَرْكٌ: and hence ضَمَانٌ<br>\
الدَّرَكِ [which see in what follows]. (Msb.)<br>\
[Hence,] لَا تَخَافُ دَرَكًا, in the Kur [xx. 80.],<br>\
means Thou shalt not fear Pharaoh&#39;s overtaking<br>\
thee. (TA.) One says also الطَّريدَةِ ↓ فَرَسٌ دَرْكُ,<br>\
meaning A horse that overtakes what is hunted;<br>\
like as they said فَرَسٌ قَيْدُ الأَوَابِدِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also The attainment, or acquisition, of an<br>\
object of want: and the seeking the attainment<br>\
or acquisition thereof: as in the saying, بَكِّرْ فَفِيهِ<br>\
دَرَكٌ [Be thou early; for therein is attainment,<br>\
&amp;c.]: and ↓ دَرْكٌ signifies the same. (Lth, TA.)<br>\
[Hence, perhaps,] يَوْمُ الدَّرِكَ: this was [a day of<br>\
contest] between El-Ows and El-Khazraj: (K:)<br>\
thought to be so by IDrd. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And i. q.<br>\
تَبِعَةٌ [i. e. A consequence; generally meaning an<br>\
evil consequence: and perhaps it also means here<br>\
a claim which one seeks to obtain for an injury]:<br>\
as also ↓ دَرْكٌ. (S, K.) One says, مَا لَحِقَكَ مِنْ<br>\
دَرَكٍ فَعَلَىِّ خَلَاصُهُ (S, TA) and ↓ من دَرْكٍ [i. e.<br>\
Whatever evil consequence ensue to thee, on me<br>\
be the compensation thereof]: in the A, ما أَدْرَكَهُ<br>\
من دَرَكٍ فعلىّ خلاصه i. e. مَا يَلْحَقُهُ مِنْ تَبِعَةٍ<br>\
[Whatever evil consequence ensue to it, &amp;c.;<br>\
relating to a thing sold]. (TA.) And hence<br>\
ضَمَانُ الدَّرَكِ in the case of a claim for indemnification for a fault of a defect or an imperfection<br>\
in a thing sold [meaning either Responsibility, or<br>\
indemnification, (see ضَمَانٌ,) for evil consequence]:<br>\
(TA in the present art:) or this means [indemnification for evil consequence in a sale; i. e.,<br>\
virtually,] the returning of the price to the purchaser on the occasion of requirement by the thing<br>\
sold: the vulgar say incorrectly [ضَمَان دَرَك, and<br>\
still more incorrectly] ضُمَان دَرَك [generally meaning thereby I sell this, or I purchase this, on the<br>\
condition of responsibility, or indemnification,<br>\
for any fault or defect or imperfection that may<br>\
be found in it]: (TA in art. ضمن:) [and in this<br>\
manner ضَمَانُ الدَّرَكِ may be correctly rendered;<br>\
for] دَرَكٌ also signifies a fault or a defect or an<br>\
imperfection [in a thing sold]; for instance, in a<br>\
slave that is sold. (TA in art. عهد.) [In the<br>\
KT, الدَّرَكُ is also explained as signifying The<br>\
purchaser&#39;s taking from the seller a pledge for<br>\
the price that he has given him, in fear that the<br>\
thing sold may require it: but this seems to be<br>\
an explanation of the case in which the word is<br>\
used; not of the word itself.]<br>\
-A2-  Also A rope,<br>\
(M, K,) or a piece of rope, (S,) that is tied upon<br>\
the [lower] extremity of the main rope (S, M, K)<br>\
of a well, to the cross pieces of wood of the bucket,<br>\
(S,) so as to be that which is next the water,<br>\
(S, M, K,) in order that the main rope may not<br>\
rot (S, M) in the drawing of water: (M:) or<br>\
a doubled rope that is tied to the cross pieces of<br>\
wood of the bucket, and then to the main wellrope: (Az, TA:) and ↓ دَرْكٌ signifies the same.<br>\
(K. [But only دَرَكٌ is authorized by the TA in<br>\
this sense.]) [See also كَرَبٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, and<br>\
↓ دَرْكٌ, The bottom, or lowest depth, (Sh, T, S,<br>\
M, K,) of a thing, (T, M, K,) as of the sea and<br>\
the like, (T,) or of anything deep, as a well and<br>\
the like: (Sh:) pl. أَدْرَاكٌ, (K,) a pl. of both, of a<br>\
form frequent and analogous with respect to the<br>\
former, but extr. with respect to the latter; and<br>\
دَرَكَاتٌ also. (TA.) And A stage of Hell:<br>\
(IAar:) a stage downwards: (MA:) or stages<br>\
downwards; like دَرَكَاتٌ: (B:) opposed to دَرَجٌ<br>\
(MA, B) and دَرَجَاتٌ, (B,) which are upwards:<br>\
wherefore, (MA, B,) the abodes of Hell, or the<br>\
stages thereof, are termed دَرَكَاتٌ; (AO, S, MA,<br>\
K, B;) [Golius and Freytag give دَرَكَةٌ as its<br>\
sing.; the former as from the S, and the latter as<br>\
from the K, in neither of which it is found;] and<br>\
those of Paradise, دَرَجَاتٌ. (S, MA, B.) It is<br>\
said in the Kur [iv. 144], إِنَّ الْمُنَافِقِينَ فِىالدَّرَكِ<br>\
الْأَسْفَلِ مِنَ النَّارِ [Verily the hypocrites shall be<br>\
in the lowest stage of the fire of Hell]: here the<br>\
Koofees, except two, read ↓ فى الدَّرْكِ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Golius gives another signification, “Pars<br>\
terræ,” as on the authority of the S and K, in<br>\
neither of which it is found.]<br>\
دِرْكَةٌ The ring of the bow-string, (K, TA,) that<br>\
falls into the notch of the bow. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
A thong that is joined to the string of the bow,<br>\
(K,) of the Arabian bow. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A<br>\
piece that is joined to the girdle when it is too<br>\
short, (Lh, K,) and in like manner, to a rope, or<br>\
cord, when it is too short. (Lh, TA.)<br>\
دَرَاكِ an imperative verbal noun, (S,) meaning<br>\
أَدْرِكْ [Attain thou, reach thou, overtake thou,<br>\
&amp;c.]: (K:) form the unused verb دَرَكَ: (IB:)<br>\
like تَرَاكِ [from تَرَكَ], meaning أُتْرُكْ. (TA.)<br>\
دِرَاكٌ [an inf. n. of 3, used in the sense of the<br>\
part. n. ↓ مُتَدَارِكٌ]. You say, طَعَنَهُ طَعْنًا دِرَاكًا<br>\
He thrust him, or pierced him, with an uninterrupted thrusting or piercing: and شَرِبَ شُرْبًا<br>\
دِرَاكًا He drank with an uninterrupted drinking:<br>\
and ضَرْبٌ دِرَاكٌ An uninterrupted beating or<br>\
striking. (TA.)<br>\
دِرَاكَةٌ: see مَدْرَكٌ.<br>\
دَرِيكَةٌ i. q. طَرِيدَةٌ [as meaning An animal that<br>\
is hunted]. (S, K.)<br>\
دَرَّاكٌ an epithet from أَدْرَكَ, (S, Kudot;,) applied to a<br>\
man, (K,) and signifying كَثِيرُ الإِدْرَاكِ [i. e. One<br>\
who attains, reaches, or overtakes, &amp;c., much, or<br>\
often: and also having much, or great, or strong,<br>\
perception: as will be seen from what follows]:<br>\
(S, TA:) and so ↓ مُدْرِكٌ [expressly said in the<br>\
TA to signify كثير الادراك, though why it should<br>\
have this signification as well as that (which it<br>\
certainly has) of simply attaining &amp;c., I cannot<br>\
see,] and ↓ مُدْرِكَةٌ: (K, TA:) the last explained<br>\
by Lh as signifying سَرِيعُ الإِدْرَاكِ [i. e. quick in<br>\
attaining, &amp;c.]. (TA.) Keys Ibn-Rifá&#39;ah says,<br>\
↓ وَصَاحِبُ الوِتْرِ لَيْسَ الدَّهْرَ مُدْرِكَهُ<br>\
عِنْدِى وَإِنِّى لَدَرَّاكٌ بِأَوْتَارِ<br>\
[And he who has a claim for blood-revenge is not<br>\
ever an attainer of it with (meaning from) me;<br>\
but verily I am one who often attains bloodrevenges]. (IB.) Seldom does فَعَّالٌ come from<br>\
أَفْعَلَ; but they sometimes said حَسَّاسٌ دَرَّاكٌ [i. e.<br>\
Having much, or great, or strong, perception];<br>\
it being [in this instance] a dialectal syn. [of<br>\
حسّاس], or thus for conformity: (S:) it is said<br>\
to be the only instance of فَعَّالٌ from أَفْعَلَ except<br>\
جَبَّارٌ and سَأّرٌ; [and some other instances might<br>\
be added; but all of them require consideration:]<br>\
accord. to IB, درّاك is from the unused verb دَرَكَ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَدْرَكٌ: see مُدْرَكٌ ―<br>\

sense in excess; [app. a preternatural perception,<br>\
or a second sight;] and so ↓ دِرَاكَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
مُدْرَكٌ A place, and a time, of إِدْرَاكٌ [i. e. attaining, reaching, overtaking, &amp;c.]. (Msb.) Hence<br>\

which are sought the ordinances of the law;<br>\
where one seeks for guidance by means of texts<br>\
[of the Kur-án or the Sunneh] and by means of<br>\
investigation by reason and comparison: (Msb:)<br>\
the lawyers make the sing. to be ↓ مَدْرَكٌ; (Mgh, *<br>\
Msb;) but there is no way of resolving this:<br>\
(Msb:) correctly, by rule, it is مُدْرَكٌ; because<br>\
the meaning intended is a place of إِدْرَاك. (Mgh.)<br>\
