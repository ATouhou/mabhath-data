its plants or herbage. (AHn, M, S.)<br>\

ادبسّ, inf. n. اِدْبِسَاسٌ; (S, K;) or ↓ ادباسّ;<br>\
(M;) He (a horse, S, M, K, and a sheep, or<br>\
goat, M, and a bird, S) became black: (K:) or<br>\
[brown; i. e.] of a colour between black and red;<br>\
(S;) or black tinged, or intermixed, with redness. (M, TA.) [See دُبْسَةٌ and أَدْبَسُ.]<br>\
11<br>\
إِدْبَاْسَّ see 9. ادباسّت الأَرْضُ The blackness of the<br>\
land became mixed with redness. (M, TA.)<br>\
دَبْسٌ Anything black. (Lth, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,<br>\
app.,] Much people; as also ↓ دِبْسٌ: (IAar, K:)<br>\
the former is also common to other things; (M, *<br>\
TA;) so that you say مَالٌ دَبْسٌ, meaning much<br>\
property. (TA.)<br>\
دُبْسٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
دِبْسٌ (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ دُبْسٌ (M)<br>\
and ↓ دِبِسٌ (K) The expressed juice of fresh<br>\
ripe dates; (A, Mgh, Msb;) what flows from<br>\
fresh ripe dates; (S;) the honey of dates; [i. e.<br>\
the sweet, thick, or inspissated, juice thereof;]<br>\
(M, K;) the expressed juice of dates, (M,) or of<br>\
fresh ripe dates not cooked: (AHn, M:) what<br>\
is called صَقْرٌ in the dial. of the people of ElMedeeneh: said by some to be the honey of fresh<br>\
ripe dates: by some, what flows, or exudes, from<br>\
raisins and from fresh grapes: and by some,<br>\
what flows from the baskets of dates: (TA:)<br>\
[see also رُبٌّ, in an explanation of which the inspissated juice of any fruit is termed its دِبْس:]<br>\
also the honey of bees, عَسَلُ النَّحْلُ: so in the<br>\
copies of the K and in [some of the copies of] the<br>\
A; a signification not known; but [AHn] EdDeenawaree mentions the word دَبَاسَاتٌ, and explains it as signifying “ domestic bee-hives; ” and<br>\
by this it is seen that the application of دبس to<br>\
what bees eject may be correct: or the true reading may be عَسَلُ النَّخْلِ, with خ, as in some<br>\
copies of the A; and it may be meant as explaining what precedes, meaning the expressed juice of<br>\
the fruit of the palm-tree, by a kind of trope;<br>\
though, as such, a useless repetition: but it is<br>\
said in the O, on the authority of IDrd, that<br>\
bees&#39; honey is called ↓ دِبِسٌ: (TA:) the vulgar<br>\
apply the word to [the inspissated juice of fresh<br>\
ripe grapes, which resembles thick honey: and<br>\
sometimes to] the honey of raisins. (MF.)<br>\
