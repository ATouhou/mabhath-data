دَهْقَنَ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  دَهْقَنُوهُ,<br>\
(inf. n. دَهْقَنَةٌ, TK,) They made him a دِهْقَان.<br>\
(K.) El-&#39;Ajjáj says,<br>\
دُهْقِنَ بِالتَّاجِ وَبِالتَّسْوِيرِ<br>\
[He was made a دهقان by receiving the تاج<br>\
(meaning either crown or turban) and by being<br>\
decked with bracelets]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  دَهْقَنَ الطَّعَامَ,<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, TA,) inf. n. دَهْقَنَةٌ, with which دَهْمَقَةٌ<br>\
is syn., (As, TA,) He made the food soft, or<br>\
delicate: (As, A&#39;Obeyd, TA:) because softness,<br>\
or delicacy, of food is from الدَّهْقَنَةُ [as meaning<br>\
التَّدَهْقُن]. (As, TA.)<br>\
Q. 2<br>\
تَدَهْقَنَ He was, or became, a دِهْقَان: (S,<br>\
K, Mgh, TA:) or he had, or possessed, much<br>\
wealth; as also ↓ دَهْقَنَ [app. in both of these<br>\
senses]: (Msb:) derived from دِهْقَانٌ. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also He affected, or feigned, or made a show of,<br>\
sharpness or quickness of intellect, cleverness,<br>\
ingeniousness, skilfulness, knowledge, or intelligence; syn. تَكَيَّسَ. (TA.)<br>\
دَهْقَنَةٌ [inf. n. of Q. 1: and signifying The state,<br>\
or condition, of a دِهْقَان;] a subst from دِهْقَانٌ;<br>\
(JK, K;) derived from the latter word. (Mgh.)<br>\
You say, لَهُ دَهْقَنَةٌ بِمَوْضِعِ كَذَا [He has a state,<br>\
or condition, which is that of a دِهْقَان in such a<br>\
place. (S.)<br>\
دِهْقَانٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) also written<br>\
دُهْقَانٌ, (JK, Msb, K,) in [some of] the copies of<br>\
the S written [دِهْقَانٌ and دَهْقَانٌ,] with kesr and<br>\
fet-h, [thus written in one of my copies of the S,]<br>\
and said by AO [as there cited] to be like قرطاس,<br>\
which is written with each of the three vowels,<br>\
(TA,) an arabicized word, (S, Msb, K,) from the<br>\
Pers. [دِهْ “a town or village” and خَانْ “a prince<br>\
or lord”]; (TA;) if derived from تَدَهْقَنَ, (Kh,<br>\
Sb, S,) i. e. if the ن be regarded as radical,<br>\
perfectly decl. [and written as above]; (Kh, Sb,<br>\
S;) but if derived from الدَّهْقُ, imperfectly decl.<br>\
[and written دِهْقَانُ &amp;c.], because of the measure<br>\
فعلانُ; (S;) [but this statement relates especially<br>\
to the measure فَعْلَان, with fet-h to the ف; except<br>\
in the case of a proper name; and an epithet of<br>\
this measure, moreover, that forms its fem. by the<br>\
addition of ة, as دهقان does, is perfectly decl.;<br>\
and it should be observed also, that,] accord.<br>\
to IJ, دهقان is of the measure فعلال, from<br>\
تَدَهْقَنَ, and there is no instance, in the language,<br>\
of the measure تَفَعْلَنَ; (Har p. 102;) it signifies<br>\
The headman, or chief, of a village or town:<br>\
(Es-Sem&#39;ánee, Msb, TA: [agreeably with the<br>\
Pers. original:]) or the proprietor thereof, in<br>\
Khurásán and El-&#39; Irák: (Es-Sem&#39;ánee, TA:)<br>\
or, as used by the Arabs, a great man of the<br>\
unbelievers of the &#39; Ajam [or Persians]: but they<br>\
disdained this appellation: (Mgh:) Lth says that<br>\
it is a nickname, or name of reproach: (TA:) it<br>\
became predominantly applied to such of them as<br>\
was of the people of the districts of cultivated<br>\
land and of villages or towns: and then to anyone possessing much land or other immoveable<br>\
property: (Mgh:) [it signifies generally a dweller,<br>\
or one having a fixed abode, in a district of<br>\
cultivated land, or in a village or town of such a<br>\
district; a rustic; a husbandman:] or it signifies<br>\
a chief, headman, or person in authority, over the<br>\
husbandmen, or peasants, of the &#39;Ajam [or Persians]: and the headman of a province: (K:)<br>\
and a possessor of land or other immoveable<br>\
property: (Msb:) and a merchant: (Msb, K:)<br>\
and one who manages affairs firmly, or strongly,<br>\
with sharpness: (K:) the fem. is with ة: (JK,<br>\
Mgh, K:) and the pl. is دَهَاقِينُ (Msb, K) and<br>\
دَهَاقِنَةٌ. (K.) [See a verse cited voce جَذَا in art.<br>\
جذو. The same verse, but with قَرْيَتِى (my<br>\
village or town) in the place of قَرْيَةٍ, is also cited<br>\
in the TA in the present art.]<br>\
