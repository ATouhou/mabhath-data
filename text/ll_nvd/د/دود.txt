دُودٌ a word of well-known signification, [Worms,<br>\
grubs, maggots, and the like; including molluscs;<br>\
as a coll. gen. n.: and, as a simple gen. n., the<br>\
worm, grub, maggot, &amp;c.:] pl. of دُودَةٌ [or rather,<br>\
as already said, and as is implied in several of<br>\
the lexicons, دُودٌ is a coll. gen. n.; therefore دُودَةٌ<br>\
is the n. un. thereof]: and the pl. of دُودٌ is<br>\
دِيدَانٌ. (T, S, L, Msb. [In the K, دِيدَانٌ is said<br>\
to be pl. of دُودَةٌ: and in the L, as from the T,<br>\
دُودَانٌ is said to be another pl. of دُودٌ: this, however, I regard as a mistake; for I do not find it<br>\
in the T; but I there find added, after دِيدَانٌ,<br>\
“ and دُودَانٌ is a tribe of Benoo-Asad. ”]) J says<br>\
that the dim. is ↓ دُوَيْدٌ, and that by rule it should<br>\
be دُوَيْدَةٌ: but this is a mistake [unless it be<br>\
meant that دُوَيْدَةٌ is the regular dim. of دُودَةٌ]:<br>\
it is regularly دُوَيْدٌ, like as تُمَيْرٌ and قُيَيْحٌ are<br>\
regular dims. of تَمْرٌ and قَمْحٌ, which are pls. [or<br>\
rather coll. gen. ns.] of تَمْرَةٌ and قَمْحَةٌ. (IB.)<br>\

track, when they play [upon the seesaw], doing<br>\

دَوْدَاةٌ is [said by ISd to belong to art. دو, and to<br>\

دَارَ, aor. يَدُورُ, inf. n. دَوْرٌ and دَوَرَانٌ (S, M,<br>\
A, Msb, K) and دُؤُورٌ (M) and مَدَارٌ; (Lth, T;)<br>\
and ↓ استدار; (M, A, Msb, K;) and ↓ ادار; (M;)<br>\
He, or it, went, moved, or turned, round; circled;<br>\
revolved; returned to the place from which he,<br>\
or it, began to move. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say, دَارُوا<br>\
حَوْلَهُ and ↓ استداروا They went round it: (A:)<br>\
and دار حَوْلَ البَيْتِ and ↓ استدار He went<br>\
round the house [or Kaabeh]. (Msb.) Z and<br>\
others dislike the phrase داربِالبَيْتِ, [which seems<br>\
to have been used in the same sense as دار حَوْلَهُ,]<br>\
preferring the phrase طَافَ بِالبَيْتِ, because of the<br>\
phrase دار بَالدُّوَارِ, signifying He went round<br>\
about in the circuit called الدُّوَار, round the idol<br>\
called by the same name. (TA.) [بِهِ ↓ استدار<br>\
mostly signifies It encircled, or surrounded, or<br>\
encompassed, it.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [You say also, دار بَيْنَهُمْ It<br>\
(a thing, as, for instance, a wine-cup) went<br>\
round, or circulated, among them. And] دار<br>\
الفَلَكُ فِى مَدَارِهِ [The firmament, or celestial orb<br>\
or sphere, revolved upon its axis]: (A:) دَوَرَانُ<br>\
الفَلَكِ signifies the consecutive incessant motions<br>\
of the several parts of the firmament. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Hence the saying دَارَتِ المَسْأَلَةُ, [inf. n. دَوْرٌ,]<br>\
The question formed a circle; one of its propositions depending for proof upon another following<br>\
it, and perhaps this upon another, and so on, and<br>\
the latter or last depending upon the admission of<br>\
the first. (Msb.) [And in like manner, دار,<br>\
inf. n. دَوْرٌ, signifies He reasoned in a circle.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  It is said in a trad., ↓ إِنَّ الزَّمَانَ قَدِ اسْتَدَارَ<br>\
كَهَيْئَتِهِ يَوْمَ خَلْقِ اللّٰهِ السَّمٰوَاتِ وَ الأَرْضَ [Verily<br>\
time hath come round to the like of the state in<br>\
which it was on the day of God&#39;s creating the<br>\
heavens and the earth: this was said by Mohammad after he had forbidden the practice of intercalating a lunar month, by which the Arabs had<br>\
long imperfectly adjusted their lunar year to the<br>\
solar.] (TA.) And one says, دَارَتِ الأَيَّامُ [The<br>\
days came round in their turns]. (S and Msb<br>\
and K in art. دول.) And يَوْمٌ لَا يَدُورُ فِى شَهْرِهِ<br>\
[A day of the week that does not come round<br>\
again in its month: as the last Wednesday, &amp;c.].<br>\
(Mujáhid, TA voce دُبَارٌ [q. v.].) [And دار is said<br>\
of an event, as meaning It came about. See an<br>\
ex. in a verse cited in art. اذ.] ―<br>\
-b6-  داربِهِ It went<br>\
round with him; as the ground and the sea do<br>\
[apparently] with a person sick by reason of<br>\
vertigo, or giddiness in the head. (L in art. ميد.<br>\
[See also 4.]) ―<br>\
-b7-  One says also, بِمَا فِى ↓ استدار<br>\
قَلْبِى (tropical:)  He comprehended [as though he encircled]<br>\
what was in my heart. (A.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And فُلَانٌ يَدُورُ<br>\
عَلَى أَرْبَعِ نِسْوَةٍ (tropical:)  Such a one has within the circuit<br>\
of his rule and care four wives, or women. (A.)<br>\
And فُلَانٌ يَدُورُ حَوْلَ فُلَانَةَ وَيُجَمِّشُهَا (tropical:)  [Such a<br>\
man has within his power and care such a<br>\
female, and toys, dallies, wantons, or holds<br>\
amorous converse, with her]. (A and TA in art.<br>\
حوض.) And أَنَا أَدُ(??) حَوْلَ ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ (tropical:)  [I have<br>\

-b2-  See also<br>\
4, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  [One says also, دوّر الآرَآءَ فِى<br>\

thoughts, or ideas, or opinions, in his mind, respecting an affair: like as one says, قَلَّبَ الفِكَرَ<br>\
فَى أَمْرٍ.]<br>\
3<br>\

hence, (assumed tropical:)  He circumvented him.] Aboo-Dhu-eyb<br>\
says,<br>\
حَتَّى أُتِيحَ لَهُ يَوْمًا بِمَرْقَبَةٍ<br>\
ذُو مِرَّةٍ بِدِوَارِ الصَّيْدُ وَجَّاسُ<br>\
[Until there was prepared for him, one day, in a<br>\
watching-place, an intelligent person, acquainted<br>\
with the circumvention of game]: وجّاس is here<br>\
made trans. by means of ب because it means the<br>\
same as عَالِمٌ in the phrase عَالِمٌ بِهِ. (M.) [Or the<br>\
meaning of the latter hemistich is, a person possessing skill in circumventing game, attentive to<br>\
their motions and sounds.] ―<br>\
-b3-  داورهُ also signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He endeavoured to induce him to turn, or<br>\
incline, or decline; or he endeavoured to turn<br>\
him by deceit, or guile; عَنِ الأَمْرِ from the thing;<br>\
and عَلَيْهِ to it; syn. لَاوَصَهُ. (M, K.) It is said<br>\
in the trad. respecting the night-journey [of Mo-<br>\
hammad to Jerusalem, and his ascension thence<br>\
into Heaven], that Moses said to Mohammad,<br>\
لَقَدْ دَاوَرْتُ بَنِى إِسْرَائِيلَ عَلَى أَدْنَى مِنْ هٰذَا فَضَعُفُوا<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  Verily I endeavoured to induce the children of<br>\
Israel to incline to less than this, and they were<br>\
unable]: or, accord. to one relation, he said<br>\
رَاوَدْتُ. (TA.) See also 4. ―<br>\
-b4-  دَاوَرَ الأُمُورَ (tropical:)  He<br>\
sought to find the modes, or manners, of doing,<br>\
or performing, affairs, or the affairs: (A:)<br>\
المُدَاوَرَةٌ is like المُعَالَجَةٌ [signifying the labouring,<br>\
taking pains, applying one&#39;s self vigorously, exerting one&#39;s self, striving, or struggling, to do, execute, or perform, or to effect, or accomplish, or<br>\
to manage, or treat, a thing; &amp;c.]. (S, K.)<br>\

signifying He was made to turn round; by<br>\
which, as by the third also, is meant] he became<br>\
affected by a vertigo, or giddiness in the head.<br>\
(S, * A, * K. [See also 1.]) ―<br>\

―<br>\
-b7-  And hence, (TA,) دَارٌ also signifies (tropical:)  A tribe;<br>\

You say, مَرَّتْ بِنَا دَارُ بَنِى فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  The tribe<br>\

-A2-  Mtr states that it is said to signify also A<br>\
