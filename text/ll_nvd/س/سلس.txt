and the epithet applied to the palm-tree in this<br>\
case is ↓ مِسْلَاسٌ; (K;) or, accord. to the Tekmileh and O and L, ↓ مُسْلِسٌ; but it seems that<br>\
↓ نَخْلَةٌ مُسْلِسٌ means a palm-tree that lets fall<br>\
and strews its unripe dates; and ↓ مِسْلَاسٌ, that<br>\
usually does thus: (TA:) and ↓ سَلَسٌ means<br>\

thrown off the mufflers. (M.)<br>\
