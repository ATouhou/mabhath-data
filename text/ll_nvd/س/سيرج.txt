the giving, or paying, thereof: for] one says,<br>\
سَمْرِجْ لَهُ, meaning Give thou to him [the tax so<br>\
called]. (ISh, O, K. [It seems to be intentionally indicated in the O and K, by what immediately precedes the explanation of this phrase,<br>\
which explanation is أَعْطِهِ, that الخَرَاجَ is to be<br>\
understood after it.])<br>\

therefore probably سَمْرَجْ,] sing. of سَمَارِجُ, (TA,)<br>\

of land. (T, * Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, TA. *)<br>\

مَرَّة “ a time,”] The levying of the [tax called]<br>\
خَرَاج at three several times [or instalments]: (S,<br>\

TA;) a day when the foreigners, or Persians,<br>\
