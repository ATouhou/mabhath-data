سَقِبَ, aor.<br>\
سَقَبَ, inf. n. سَقَبٌ, He, or it, was,<br>\
or became, near. (Msb.) سَقَبٌ is syn. with قُرْبٌ.<br>\
(S, A, K.) You say, سَقِبَتْ دَارُهُ, (S, and so in the<br>\
K accord. to the TA,) with kesr [to the ق], (S,)<br>\
[inf. n. as above;] or سَقَبَت, (so in the CK and<br>\
in my MS. copy of the K and in my copy of the<br>\
Mgh,) inf. n. سَقْبٌ, (so in my copy of the Mgh,)<br>\
or سُقُوبٌ; (K;) [but I believe the verb to be<br>\
correctly سَقِبَت, like its syn. صَقِبَت, and the<br>\
inf. n. to be correctly سَقَبٌ, and perhaps سُقُوبٌ<br>\
also;] His house was near; (S, Mgh, K;) as also<br>\
↓ أَسْقَبَت. (S, K.) It is said in a trad., الجَارُ أَحَقُّ<br>\
بِسَقَبِهِ, meaning [The neighbour has a better, or<br>\
the best, claim to pre-emption] by reason of his<br>\
being near: (S, * A, Msb:) or the ب is a connective of احقّ with its complement, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) not to denote a cause, (Mgh,) and بِسَقَبِهِ<br>\
is expl. as meaning بِالضْلَرRُّفْعَةِ; (Mgh, Msb;) i. e.<br>\
the neighbour has a better, or the best, claim to<br>\
الضْلَرRُّفْعَة [or pre-emption], when his house is contiguous: (Mgh:) IAth says that it is adduced<br>\
as an evidence that الضْلَرRُّفْعَة belongs to the neighbour though not a sharer; i. e., that he has a<br>\
better claim thereto than one who is not a neighbour: but some explain الجار as meaning the<br>\
partner, or sharer: or the meaning of the trad.<br>\
may be, the neighbour has a better, or the best,<br>\
claim to kindness and assistance because of his<br>\
being near. (L, TA. [See also another reading<br>\
(بِصَقَبِهِ), and explanations thereof, in art. صقب.])<br>\
4<br>\
اسقبهُ He made him, or it, to be near: (K:)<br>\
or اسقب دَارَهُ he made his house to be near. (S.)<br>\
[And so with ص.]<br>\
-A2-  See also the paragraph<br>\
above.<br>\
-A3-  أَسْقَبَتْ is also said of a she-camel,<br>\
meaning She brought forth mostly males. (A, *<br>\
TA.) [And اسقب He got, or got mostly, male<br>\
offspring.] In the following saying, (S, TA,) of<br>\
Ru-beh, describing the two parents of a man<br>\
eulogized [by him], (TA,)<br>\
وَكَانَتِ العِرْسُ الَّّتِى تَنَخَّبَا<br>\
لِفَحْلٍ أَسْقَبَا ↓ غَرَّآءَ مِسْقَابًا<br>\
[And the wife whom he chose was generous, or<br>\
noble, or fair, one that brought forth, or brought<br>\
forth mostly, male offspring, to a male that<br>\
begot, or begot mostly, such offspring,] the last<br>\
word is a verb, in the pret. tense, not an epithet<br>\
applied to فحل. (S, * TA. [In the former, only<br>\
the second hemistich is cited.])<br>\
6<br>\
تساقبت أَبْيَاتُهُمْ was probably used as meaning Their tents, or houses, were near together:<br>\
see the part. n. of this verb below.]<br>\
سَقْبٌ The young one of a camel: or, when just<br>\
brought forth: (K:) or only the male young one<br>\
of a camel: (S, K:) [see also صَقْبٌ:] when a<br>\
she-camel has brought forth her young one, the<br>\
latter, when just born, is called سَلِيلٌ, before it is<br>\
known whether it is a male or a female; but<br>\
when it is known, if it is a male, it is called<br>\
سَقْبٌ: (As, TA:) the female is not called سَقْبَةٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) but حَائِلٌ: (S:) or it is [sometimes]<br>\
called by the former of these appellations: (K:)<br>\
[see De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe, 2nd ed., ii. 358:<br>\
and see سَقْبَةٌ below:] the pl. is أَسْقُبٌ [a pl. of<br>\
pauc.] and سِقَابٌ and سُقُوبٌ and سُقْبَانٌ. (K.)<br>\
أَذَلُّ مِنَ السُّقْبَانِ بَيْنَ الحَلَائِبِ<br>\

among the milch camels] is a prov. [from a verse<br>\

وَسَاقِيَيْنِ مِثْلَ زَيْدٍ وَجُعَلْ<br>\
سَقْبَانِ مَمْضْلَرRُوقَانِ مَكْنُوزَا العَضَلْ<br>\
سَقْبَانِ signifies طَوِيلَانِ [tall], and is also written<br>\
صَقْبَانِ: (Sh, TA:) [so that the meaning may be,<br>\
And two waterers, or givers of drink, like Zeyd and<br>\
Jo&#39;al: they being two tall persons, light of flesh,<br>\
compact in the muscles: I suppose هُمَا to be<br>\
understood before the latter hemistich; because<br>\
of the ns. in the nom. case: and I have substituted مَكْنُوزَا for مَنْكُوزَا, the reading in the TA,<br>\
doubtless a mistranscription:] or it is for مِثْلَ<br>\
سَقْبَيْنِ [meaning like two male young ones of<br>\
camels]. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The pole of a [tent<br>\

(TA,) and put upon her head, making its extremity to protrude from a hole, or rent, of her<br>\
