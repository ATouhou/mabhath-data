the hair over his forehead]: or سَفْعٌ signifies the<br>\
laying hold upon, or seizing, the سُفْعَة of the<br>\

لَنَسْفَعًا بِالنَّاصِيَةِ; (S, K, &amp;c.;) [or لَنَسْفَعَا; (see<br>\
أَلِفُ النُّونِ الخَفِيفَةِ in art. ا;)] the Arabs [sometimes] substituting ا for the quiescent ن [in a<br>\

upon his ناصية and drag him thereby with violence to the fire: (Bd:) or we will assuredly<br>\

face black, and his eyes blue: (O:) or we will<br>\
assuredly abase him: or, render him despicable:<br>\
(O, K:) or we will assuredly abase him and<br>\
make him to stand: so in the L and other lexicons; for these, instead of أولَنُقْمِئَنَّهُ in the O<br>\
and K, have وَلَنُقِيمَنَّهُ, and this is shown to be the<br>\
right reading by the last explanation in the sentence next preceding. (TA.)<br>\
