سَكَرَ,<br>\
(TK,) inf. n. سَكَرٌ, (IAar, K,) It (a wateringtrough, or tank, TK) was, or became, full.<br>\

in my MS. copy of the K,) or سَكَرَت, (S, O, and<br>\
so in the CK,) aor.<br>\
سَكُرَ, (S, O,) or, as some<br>\
relate a verse of Jendel Ibn-El-Muthennà Et-<br>\
Tuhawee, in which it occurs,<br>\
سَكَرَ, (O,) [indicating<br>\
that the pret. is سَكِرَت or that the aor. is irreg.,]<br>\
inf. n. سُكُورٌ (S, O, K) and سَكَرَانٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  The<br>\

(S.) And سَكَرَ, [or سَكِرَ,] inf. n. سُكُورٌ, (tropical:)  It (water)<br>\
became still, ceasing to run: so says AZ: and (tropical:)  it<br>\

-b3-  Also, (S, Mgh, Msb,) aor. as above, (S,<br>\
Msb,) and so the inf. n.; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) and<br>\
↓ سكّرهُ, inf. n. تَسْكِيرٌ; (MF;) He stopped it up, or<br>\
dammed it; namely, a river, or rivulet. (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K, MF.) And hence, سَكَرَ البَابَ, and ↓ سكّرهُ,<br>\

-b4-<br>\
سُكِرَتْ أَبْصَارُنَا: see 2.<br>\
2<br>\
سكّرهُ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  And see also 1, last two explanations. ―<br>\
-b3-  سُكِرَتْ أَبْصَارُنَا, in the Kur [xv. 15],<br>\
means (tropical:)  Our eyes have been prevented from<br>\
seeing, and dazzled: (S, K:) or have been covered<br>\
over: (Aboo-&#39; Amr Ibn-El-&#39; Alà, S, K:) and ↓ سُكِرَتْ,<br>\
without teshdeed, have been prevented from seeing:<br>\
(Fr, K: *) or this latter, which is the reading of<br>\
El-Hasan, means, accord. to him, have been enchanted: (S:) or both mean, have been covered<br>\
and closed by enchantment, so that we imagined<br>\
ourselves to behold things which we did not<br>\
really see: (T, TA:) Mujáhid explains the latter<br>\
reading as meaning, have been stopped up; i. e.,<br>\
have been covered by that which prevented their<br>\
seeing, like as water is prevented from flowing by<br>\
a سِكْر [or dam]: (A &#39;Obeyd:) and another reading<br>\
is ↓ سَكِرَتْ, meaning, have become dazzled, like<br>\
those of the intoxicated: (Ksh, Bd: *) AO says<br>\
that أَبْصَارُ القَوْمِ ↓ سَكِرَتْ means (tropical:)  The people became<br>\
affected by a giddiness; and an affection like<br>\
cloudiness of the eye, or weakness of the sight,<br>\
came over them, so that they did not see; and<br>\
Aboo-&#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;Alà says that this signification is derived from سُكْرٌ; as though their eyes<br>\
were intoxicated: Zj says that عَيْنُهُ ↓ سَكِرَتْ means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  his eye became dazzled, and ceased to see. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  سُكِّرَ لِلْحَاجَةِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  His judgment, or<br>\
opinion, was confused respecting the object of<br>\
want, is said of a man only before he has determined upon the thing alluded to. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
سكّرهُ, inf. n. تَسْكِيرٌ, also signifies He squeezed his<br>\
throat, or throttled him. (S, K.) One says,<br>\
البَعِيرُ يُسَكِّرُ آخَرَ بِذِرَاعِهِ حَتَّى يَكَادُ يَقْتُلُهُ [The<br>\
camel throttles another with his arm so that he<br>\
almost kills him]. (S.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسكرهُ It (wine, or beverage,) intoxicated,<br>\
or inebriated, him; (S, A;) or deprived him of<br>\
his reason; (Msb;) as also, accord. to some,<br>\
↓ سَكَرَهُ; (MF, TA;) but the former is that which<br>\
commonly obtains; (TA;) [and ↓ سكّرهُ has the<br>\
same signification; or its inf. n.] تَسْكِيرٌ signifies<br>\
the causing, or making, to be affected with the<br>\
remains of intoxication. (KL. [See the pass.<br>\
part. n. of this last, below.]) The first is also said<br>\
of قريض [app. a mistranscription for قريص,<br>\
which may be syn. with قَارِصٌ, meaning “ sour<br>\
milk,” for this has an effect like intoxication<br>\
when too much of it has been drunk]; and thus<br>\
applied it is tropical. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تساكر He feigned intoxication, or a state<br>\
of drunkenness. (S, A. *)<br>\
8<br>\
استكر الضَّرْعُ The udder became full of milk.<br>\
(MA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And استكرت السَّمَآءُ The sky rained<br>\
vehemently. (MA.)<br>\
سَكْرٌ: see سَكْرَانُ:<br>\
-A2-  and سِكْرٌ.<br>\
-A3-  Also A certain herb, or leguminous plant, (بَقْلَةٌ,) of such as<br>\
are termed أَحْرَار [pl. of حُرٌّ], (Aboo-Nasr, K,)<br>\
which is of the best of بُقُول: (TA as from the<br>\
K: [but not in my MS. copy of the K nor in the<br>\
CK:]) AHn says that no description of its<br>\
general attributes or qualities had come to his<br>\
knowledge. (TA.)<br>\
سُكْرٌ an inf. n., (A, Mgh, K,) or a simple<br>\
subst., signifying Intoxication, inebriation, or<br>\
drunkenness; i. e. the state thereof; (S, Msb;)<br>\
a state that intervenes as an obstruction between<br>\
a man and his intellect; mostly used in relation<br>\
to intoxicating drinks: but sometimes as meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:) such a state arising from anger, or from the<br>\
passion of love: a poet says,<br>\
سُكْرَانِ سُكْرُ هَوًى وَسُكْرُ مُدَامَةٍ<br>\
أَنَّى يُفِيقُ فَتًى بِهِ سُكْرَانِ<br>\
[Two intoxications, the intoxication of love and<br>\
the intoxication of wine: how shall a youth recover his senses in whom are two intoxications?].<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
سِكْرٌ a subst. from السَّكْرُ (Mgh, K) as meaning<br>\
“ the stopping up, or damming,” of the river, or<br>\
rivulet; (K;) i. e. A dam; a thing with which<br>\
a river, or rivulet, is stopped up; (S, * Msb, K,<br>\
TA;) and ↓ سَكْرٌ, originally an inf. n., occurs in<br>\
the same sense: (Mgh:) the pl. of the former is<br>\
سُكُورٌ. (K.)<br>\
سَكَرٌ Wine: (K:) so, accord. to Fr and others<br>\
in the Kur [xvi. 69], تَتَّخِذُونَ مِنْهُ سَكَرًا وَرِزْقًا حَسَنًا,<br>\
meaning, ye obtain therefrom wine, and raisins<br>\
and dried dates and the like; this being said<br>\
before wine was prohibited: (TA:) and the<br>\
[beverage called] نَبِيذ (S, A) prepared from dried<br>\
dates: (S:) so in the Kur, ubi suprà: (S:) or<br>\
the expressed juice of fresh ripe dates when it has<br>\
become strong; (Mgh, Msb;) originally an inf. n.:<br>\
(Mgh:) or an infusion of dried dates, untouched<br>\
by fire: (A &#39;Obeyd:) a beverage, (A,) or نَبِيذ,<br>\
(K,) made from dried dates and from كَشُوث<br>\
[a species of cuscuta, or dodder] (A, K) and<br>\
myrtle, آس, (A,) which is the most bitter beverage in the world, (A,) and forbidden like wine;<br>\
(TA;) or made from dried dates and كشوث,<br>\
disposed layer upon layer, upon which water is<br>\
poured; and some assert that sometimes myrtle<br>\
(آس) is mixed with it, and this increases its<br>\
strength: (AHn:) also anything that intoxicates: (K:) and what is forbidden [that is obtained] from fruit (I&#39;Ab, T, K) [of the palm-tree<br>\
and grape vine], meaning wine, before its being<br>\
forbidden; and الرِّزْقُ الحَسَنُ is what is lawful<br>\
[that is obtained] from grapes and dates: (I &#39;Ab,<br>\
T, TA:) and vinegar; (K;) accord. to some of<br>\
the expositors of the Kur, ubi suprà; but this is<br>\
a meaning unknown to the leading lexicologists:<br>\
(B, TA:) and food: (K:) so accord. to AO<br>\
alone; as in the following saying of a poet;<br>\
جَعَلْتَ أَعْرَاضَ الكِرَامِ سَكَرَا<br>\
[Thou hast made the reputations of the generous<br>\
to be food: or] thou hast made the vituperation<br>\
of the generous to be food to thee: but the leading<br>\
lexicologists disallow this; and Zj says that the<br>\
more probable meaning here is wine. (TA.)<br>\
سَكِرٌ: see سَكْرَانُ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and سِكِيرٌ.<br>\
سَكْرَةٌ A fit of intoxication: (A, Mgh:) pl.<br>\
سَكَرَاتٌ. (Mgh.) You say, ذَهَبَ بَيْنَ الصَّحْوَةِ<br>\
وَالسَّكْرَةِ He went away in state between that<br>\
of sensibility and insensibility, or mental perception and inability thereof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
(tropical:)  A fit of anger. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  An overpowering sensation of delight, affecting youth.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  سَكْرَةُ المَوْتِ (tropical:)  [The intoxication of death;<br>\
meaning] the confusion of the intellect by reason<br>\
of the severity of the agony of death: (B, TA:)<br>\
the oppressive sensation attendant upon death,<br>\
which deprives the sufferer of reason: (Bd in<br>\
1. 18:) the oppressive sensation, (S, A, * Mgh, K,)<br>\
and disturbance of the mind, and insensibility,<br>\
(K,) attendant upon death. (S, * A, Mgh, K.)<br>\
And in like manner, سَكْرَةُ الهَمِ, (K,) and النَّوْمِ,<br>\
(TA,) (tropical:)  The oppressive sensation, &amp;c., attendant<br>\
upon anxiety, (K,) and upon sleep. (TA.)<br>\
سَكَرَةٌ I. q. شَيْلَمٌ; (K;) [or resembling the<br>\
شَيْلَم; (see زُؤَانٌ;) a certain plant, app. called<br>\
by the former name because a decoction thereof<br>\
is used as an anæsthetic; said to be] the same<br>\
that is called مُرَيْرَآءُ, that is [often found] in<br>\
wheat. (TA.)<br>\
سَكْرَانُ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and سَكْرَانٌ, (TA,)<br>\
which latter is seldom used, and is of the dial. of<br>\
the Benoo-Asad, as is said in the S and Msb of<br>\
its fem., (TA,) and ↓ سَكْرٌ; (K; [in the TA ↓ سَكِرٌ,<br>\
but this is afterwards mentioned in the K as an<br>\
intensive epithet;]) fem. [of the first,] سَكْرَى;<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K;) and [of the second,] سَكْرَانَةٌ;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) and [of the third,] سَكْرَةٌ; (K; [in<br>\
the TA سَكِرَهٌ;]) Intoxicated; inebriated; drunken:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) [see سُكْرٌ:] pl. سُكَارَى [which is<br>\
said in the TA to be also pl. of سَكِرٌ] and سَكَارَى,<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) of which the former is the more<br>\
common, or, as some say, the latter, and the<br>\
former of which is said to be the only instance of<br>\
the kind, except كُسَالَى and عُجَالَى and غُيَارَى,<br>\
(TA,) [to which should be added حُيَارَى, and<br>\
probably some other instances,] and سَكْرَى; (S,<br>\
K;) or this is a fem. sing. applied as an epithet<br>\
to a pl. n.; (Fr;) and in the Kur iv. 46, ElAamash read سُكْرَى, with damm, which is very<br>\
strange, since no pl. of the measure فُعْلَى is<br>\
known. (TA.) Th says that the words of the<br>\
Kur [iv. 46] لَا تَقْرَبُواالصَّلَاةَ وَأَنْتُمْ سُكَارَى [Engage<br>\
ye not in prayer when ye are intoxicated] was<br>\
said before the prohibition of wine was revealed:<br>\
others say that the meaning is, when ye are<br>\
intoxicated with sleep. (TA.)<br>\
سُكُرْكَةٌ, written by Sh سُكْرُكَةٌ: see art. سكرك.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
سَكُورٌ: see سِكِيرٌ.<br>\
سُكَّرٌ [Sugar;] a certain sweet substance, (TA,)<br>\
well known: (Msb, TA:) a Pers. word, (S,)<br>\
arabicized, (S, K,) from شَكَرْ: (K:) n. un. with ة<br>\
[signifying a piece of sugar]: (S, K:) it is hot<br>\
and moist, accord. to the most correct opinion;<br>\
but some say, cold: and the best sort of it is the<br>\
transparent, called طَبَرْزَذٌ; and the old is more<br>\
delicate than the new: it is injurious to the<br>\
stomach, engendering yellow bile; but the juice<br>\
of the لَيْمُون and نَارَنْج counteract its noxiousness:<br>\
it is said to be a word recently introduced; but<br>\
some say that it occurs in one trad. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also Like سُكَّر [or sugar] in sweetness: so used<br>\
by Aboo-Ziyád El-Kilábee. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A<br>\
certain kind of sweet fresh ripe dates; (K;) a<br>\
sort of fresh ripe dates, likened to sugar in sweetness: (Mgh:) or a kind of very sweet dates;<br>\
(AHát, T, Msb;) known to the people of ElBahreyn, (T,) and in Sijilmáseh and Dar&#39;ah,<br>\
and, as some say, in El-Medeeneh, where, how-<br>\
ever, they require to be dried artificially. (MF.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  A kind of grapes, which, being affected<br>\
by what is termed مَرَق, fall off, (K,) for the<br>\
most part: their bunches are of middling size;<br>\
and they are white, juicy, and very sweet, (TA,)<br>\
of the best kinds of grapes; (K;) and are made<br>\
into raisins. (TA.)<br>\
سُكَّرِىٌّ [Sugary; saccharine. ―<br>\
-b2-  And] Cake<br>\
containing sugar, or barley-sugar, with almonds,<br>\

called نَبِيذ; syn. نَبَّاذٌ. (S, K.)<br>\

often; a drunkard; a tippler; (K;) as also<br>\
↓ مِسْكِيرٌ (S, K) and ↓ سَكُورٌ (IAar, K) and ↓ سَكِرٌ:<br>\
(K:) or constantly intoxicated: (S:) the pl. of<br>\
سَكِرٌ is سُكَارَى, which is also pl. of سَكْرَانُ. (TA.)<br>\
رِيحٌ سَاكِرَةٌ (tropical:)  Wind becoming still. (A.) And<br>\
لَيْلَةٌ سَاكِرَةٌ (tropical:)  A still night; a night in which the<br>\

سَيْكُرَانٌ A certain plant, always green, the<br>\
grain whereof is eaten: (K: [but this description<br>\
seems to be an incorrect abstract of what here<br>\
follows:]) Ed-Deenawaree [i. e. AHn] says, it is<br>\
of the plants that continue green throughout the<br>\
whole of the summer: I asked a sheykh of the<br>\
Arabs of Syria, and he said, it is the سُخَر, [correctly سُخَّر,] and we eat it in its fresh state, with<br>\
what an eating! and, he said, it has green grains,<br>\
like the grain of the رَازِيَانَج [or fennel], except<br>\
that they are round: (O:) [in the present day,<br>\
it is applied to henbane, or a species thereof:<br>\
accord. to Forskål, (Flora Aegypt. Arab.,<br>\
p. lxiii.,) hyoscyamus datora. See also شَيْكُرَانٌ.]<br>\
