such a rope is also termed ↓ مَسْحُولٌ; but not<br>\
↓ مُسْحَلٌ, for the sake of [analogy to] مُبْرَمٌ; (S,<br>\
TA;) or the latter epithet is sometimes applied to<br>\

or spun thread not composed of two twists. (TA.)<br>\

Msb, * TA,) meaning “ a white garment or piece<br>\
of cloth (Mgh, TA) of cotton; ” (TA;) but this<br>\
is [said to be] a mistake; (Msb;) or it is allowable because فُعُولٌ sometimes occurs as the<br>\
measure of a sing., to which this pl. is likened;<br>\
as is said in the O: (TA:) or the former appellation is applied, as some say, to garments, or<br>\
pieces of cloth, beaten and washed and whitened;<br>\

in plain, or soft, tracts: (AHn, TA:) its twigs<br>\
are used for cleaning the teeth: (AHn, K * TA:)<br>\
and Imra-el-Keys likens the fingers of a woman<br>\

شَكِيم of the bridle, (K, TA,) which is [generally<br>\
applied to the bit-mouth, but is here said by SM<br>\
to be] the piece of iron that is beneath the lower<br>\

desisting from it: (K, TA:) مِسْحَلٌ signifying<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  error: (K:) and [in like manner] طَعَنَ فِى<br>\

جَانِبُ:)] or the lower part of each عِذَار [or side<br>\

in the CK is a mistake for أَسْفَلُ:]) or the place<br>\
of the عِذَار: (Az, TA:) or the temple; مِسْحَلَانِ<br>\
meaning the two temples: (TA:) and (K) the<br>\
