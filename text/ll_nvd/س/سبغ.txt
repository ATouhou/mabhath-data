but when it [the helmet] is not of plate, or expanded metal, but is [a head-covering] of mail, it<br>\
is called مِغْفَرٌ and غِفَارَةٌ and تَسْبِغَةٌ: (TA:) [the<br>\
pl. is تَسَابِغُ:] and the helmet [that has a تَسْبِغَة<br>\

term the mail attached to the bottom thereof,] is<br>\
called ↓ سَابِغٌ: (JK:) or, accord. to As, one says<br>\
بَيْضَةٌ لَهَا سَابِغٌ, (S,) or لَهَا تَسَابِغُ. (K, TA: in the<br>\
CK [erroneously] تَسَابُغٌ.)<br>\
مُسْبِغٌ, (S, A, L, TA,) in the O and K ↓ سُبُغٌ,<br>\
like عُنُقٌ, which seems to be a mistranscription,<br>\
copied by the author of the K, accord, to his<br>\
usual practice, from the O, (TA,) A man having<br>\
upon him a coat of mail such as is termed سَابِغَةٌ.<br>\
(S, A, O, L, K.)<br>\
مُسَبَّغٌ is expl. by Kr as meaning The young<br>\
