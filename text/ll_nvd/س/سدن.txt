سَدُنَ, (S, L,) inf. n. سَدْنٌ<br>\
and سِدَانَةٌ, [or the latter, accord. to the Msb,<br>\

سَدُنَ, inf. n. سَدْنٌ, has the former meaning.<br>\
(Msb.) A &#39;Obeyd says, (L,) سِدَانَةُ الكَعْبَةِ signifies<br>\
The ministry, or service, of the Kaabeh, (Mgh,<br>\
L,) and the superintendence thereof, and the<br>\
opening and locking of its door. (L.) The<br>\
سِدَانَة and the لِوَآء [q. v.] belonged to [the family<br>\
named] Benoo-&#39;Abd-ed-Dár in the Time of Ignorance, and the Prophet confirmed it to them<br>\
in El-Islám: (S, L:) [in the first age of ElIslám,] the سدانة of the Kaabeh belonged to the<br>\
sons of &#39;Othmán Ibn-Talhah [of the family of<br>\
Benoo-&#39;Abd-ed-Dár]. (Mgh.) السِّدَانَةُ signifies<br>\
[also (L)] الحِجَابَةُ [which seems to be properly<br>\
a subst., meaning The office of door-keeper, or<br>\
chamberlain, but here seems, from the context, to<br>\
be used as an inf. n., meaning the performing<br>\
that office]: you say, سَدَنَهُ, aor. as above, [app.<br>\
meaning He acted as door-keeper, or chamberlain,<br>\

سَدَنَهُ, inf. n. سِدَانَةٌ, signifies he served it, or him.<br>\

some to be a substitute for ل: (M, L:) or<br>\
أَسْدَانٌ is a dial. var. of أَسْدَالٌ signifying the<br>\

سَادِنٌ A minister, or servant, of the Kaabeh,<br>\

(M, L:) but IB says that there is this difference<br>\
between the سَادِن and the حَاجِب; that the latter<br>\
precludes, and his license to do so belongs to<br>\
another; whereas the سادن precludes, and his<br>\
license to do so belongs to himself. (L.)<br>\

their going along; (TA;) as also ↓ استدى, (M,<br>\
K, TA,) in [some of] the copies of the K اسدى,<br>\
but the former is the right. (TA.) You say of a<br>\

or beautiful, is her stretching forth of her hind<br>\

not obeying a guide to the right course, in<br>\
journeying; (S, M;) said in relation to camels<br>\

(K,) aor. يَسْدُو, (TA,) inf. n. سَدْوٌ, (M, TA,)<br>\
He (a boy, or child,) played with walnuts, (M,<br>\

↓ سدّى as signifying also “ Oblivit telam viscosiore<br>\

conciliandi ergo; ” as on the authority of the KL;<br>\
in my copy of which I find only its inf. n.,<br>\
تَسْدِيَةٌ, expl. as meaning the weaver&#39;s making a<br>\
warp in a garment, or piece of cloth (تار درجامه<br>\
كردن جولاه): and Freytag adds, as a signification assigned to the same verb by Jac. Schultens,<br>\
“ Cirris s. fimbriis ornavit vestem. ”] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
one says, الأُمُورَ وَيُنِيرُهَا ↓ هُوَ يُسَدِّى (A in art. نير)<br>\
or يُسْدِى (TA in that art.) [meaning (assumed tropical:)  He commences things, or affairs, and completes them].<br>\

in the latter case, عليه, not اليه,]) or اسدى إِلَيْهِ<br>\
مَعْزُوفًا, (Msb,) he did to him, or conferred upon<br>\
him, a benefit, benefaction, favour, or the like:<br>\
(M, * Msb, TA:) [app. from اسدى الثَّوْبَ, and<br>\
سدّاهُ; and accordingly mentioned in the M in<br>\
art. سدى: or] it is from سدى [or rather سَدَا,<br>\
inf. n. سَدْوٌ,] as meaning “ he (a camel) put forward his fore legs in going along; ” for he of<br>\
whom one says أَسْدَاكَ خَيْرًا [he did to thee good,<br>\
like أَسْدَى إِلَيْكَ خَيْرًا,] is as though he stretched<br>\
forth to the his arm, or hand, therewith, advancing: (Ham p. 696:) you say, اسدى نِعْمَةً,<br>\
meaning اِصْطَنْع [i. e. he did a benefit, &amp;c.]. (Idem<br>\
p. 759.) ―<br>\
-b6-  You say also, طَلَبْتُ أَمْرًا فَأَسْدَيْتُهُ i. e.<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [I sought a thing, and] I attained it, or obtained it: [as though meaning I stretched forth<br>\
my hand to it and reached it:] if you do not<br>\
attain it, or obtain it, you say, أَعْمَسْتُهُ: (S:) or<br>\
إِسْدَآءٌ signifies the attaining quickly. (KL.<br>\
[There expl. by the words زود دريافتن: for which<br>\
Golius seems to have found in his copy زود رفتن;<br>\
for he has assigned to اسدى, as on the authority<br>\
of the KL, the meaning of cito incessit.])<br>\
-A2-<br>\
اسداهُ also signifies He left, let alone, or neglected, him, or it: (K:) he left him to himself,<br>\
uncontrolled, (M, Msb,) neither commanded nor<br>\
forbidden. (M.) And you say, أَسْدَيْتُ إِبِلِى,<br>\

(S, M, K;) syn. رَكِبَهُ, (M, K,) and عَلَاهُ; (S,<br>\
M, K;) namely, a thing. (M.) A poet says, (S,<br>\
TA,) namely, Imra-el-Keys, (TA,)<br>\
فَثَوْبًا نَسِيتُ وَثَوْبًا أَجُرْ  فَلَمَّا دَنَوْتُ تَسَدَّيْتُهَا<br>\
[And when I drew near, I got upon her, and a<br>\
garment I forgot, or neglected, and a garment I<br>\
was dragging upon the ground: أَجُرْ being for<br>\
أَجُرُّ]. (S, TA.) And سدى جَارِيَتَهُ [or ↓ سَدَا (for<br>\
تسدّاهُ meaning as expl. above is mentioned in<br>\
the M in art. سدو), or it may be ↓ سدّى] signifies [in like manner] عَلَاهَا. (TA.) ―<br>\

commander, recited an oration, or a harangue,<br>\

said to mean ”]) the portion [or threads] thereof<br>\
extended longitudinally (M, * Msb, K *) in the<br>\
weaving: (Msb:) and it is said to mean the<br>\
lower, or lowest, part thereof: (M: [but this is<br>\
a strange explanation, which I do not find elsewhere:]) it is [said to be] from السَّدْوُ [inf. n. of<br>\
سَدَا] signifying “ the stretching forth the arm, or<br>\
hand, or the fore leg, towards a thing: ” (Har<br>\
p. 241: [but it is mentioned in the M as belonging to art. سدى; and its dual, mentioned below,<br>\

also [and more commonly] written ↓ أُسْدِىٌّ, (K,)<br>\
signifies the same; (M, K;) as also ↓ سَدَاةٌ; (S,<br>\
K;) or this last is the n. un. of سَدًى, (M, TA,)<br>\
having a more special signification, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
[as though meaning a warp, or a sort of warp;<br>\
or the لُحْمَةٌ may be affixed for the purpose of assimilating the word to its contr. سَدًى, with which it<br>\
is often coupled:] the dual [of سَدًى] is سَدَيَانِ:<br>\
(S, Msb, TA:) and the pl. is أَسْدِيَةٌ (accord. to<br>\
the S) or أَسْدَآءٌ. (Msb.) ↓ مَا أَنْتَ بِلُحْمَةٍ وَلَا سَدَاةٍ<br>\
[lit. Thou art neither a woof nor a warp] is said<br>\

dial. of El-Medeeneh. (TA.) [See also the last<br>\
sentence of the next paragraph: and see سَيَابٌ.]<br>\
-A3-  Also sometimes used in the sense of سُدًى.<br>\

sense to anything. (AHn, M.) ―<br>\

And you say أَرْضٌ سَدِيَةٌ A land moist with much<br>\
night-dew. (S, Msb.) And لَيْلَةٌ سَدِيَةٌ A night<br>\
moist with much dew: (M, * TA:) the epithet<br>\
[سَدٍ] is seldom applied to a day. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And بَلَحٌ سَدٍ Dates in the state in which they<br>\
are termed بَلَح, (S, M, K,) accord. to As, when<br>\

(As, T, M:) one thereof [i. e. a بَلَحَة] is termed<br>\
