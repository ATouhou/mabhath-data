سَوِىَ, aor. يَسْوَى: see 3, in two places.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
[Accord. to Golius, سَوَى, inf. n. سِوًى, signifies<br>\
He intended, or proposed to himself: this he says<br>\
as on the authority of the KL, in which only the<br>\
inf. n. is mentioned with the explanation قصد<br>\
وآهنگ كردن: and to this, Freytag adds the<br>\
authority of Meyd; and also that the verb governs<br>\
the thing which is its objective complement in the<br>\
accus. case. In the S and other lexicons of good<br>\
repute, I find the meaning of قَصَدَ assigned to<br>\
اِسْتَوَى followed by إِلَى; but in none to سَوَى.]<br>\
2<br>\
سوّاهُ, (S, M, &amp;c.,) inf. n. تَسْوِيَةٌ, (K,) He<br>\
made it equal, equable, uniform, even, level,<br>\
flat, plane or plain; (S, * M, MA, Msb, K;) or<br>\
equal in respect of elevation or of depression;<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA;) [and straight, right, direct,<br>\
or rightly directed; (see its quasi-pass. 8;)] and<br>\
↓ اسواهُ signifies the same; (M, K;) namely, a<br>\
place, (Msb, K,) or a thing, (S, M, Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA,) or an uneven, or a crooked, thing. (Mgh.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., فَأَمَرَ بِالخِرَبِ فَسُوِّيَتْ [And he<br>\
gave orders respecting the ruins, and they were<br>\
levelled]. (TA in art. خرب.) And in another<br>\
trad., سَوَّيْنَا عَلَى رُقَيَّةَ, meaning We buried Ru-<br>\
keiyeh, and made the earth of the grave even, or<br>\
level, over her. (Mgh.) [Hence also,] سُوِّيتْ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ الأَرْضُ: see 8. And hence the saying in the<br>\
Kur [iv. 45], لُوْ تُسَوَّى بِهِمُ الْأَرْضُ, (TA,) i. e.<br>\
That they were buried, and that the ground were<br>\
made level over them; (S, * Bd;) بِ being here<br>\
syn. with عَلَى: (TA in art. ب:) or the meaning<br>\
is, that they became like the dust of the earth;<br>\
(M, Jel;) thus expl. by Th; (M;) or that they<br>\
had not been created, and that they and the earth<br>\
were alike. (Bd.) [Hence also,] بَلَى قَادِرِينَ<br>\
عَلَى أَنْ نُسَوِّىَ بَنَانَهُ, in the same [lxxv. 4], is said<br>\
to mean [Yea: we are able] to make his hand<br>\
like the foot of the camel, without fingers: or to<br>\
make his fingers uniform, of one measure or size:<br>\
(TA:) or the meaning is, we are able to put<br>\
together the bones of his fingers [consistently] as<br>\
they were. (Bd, Jel.) And بَيْنَ ↓ حَتَّى إِذَا سَاوَى<br>\
الصَّدَفَيْنِ, in the Kur [xviii. 95], means سَوَّى<br>\
بَيْنَهُمَا [i. e. Until, when he had made the space<br>\
between the two sides of the mountains even, or<br>\
level, by filling it up]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also He made<br>\
it uniform, equal, or consimilar, with another<br>\
thing.] One says, سَوَّيْتُهُ بِهِ, (M, K,) inf. n. as<br>\
above; (K;) and به ↓ سَاوَيْتُهُ, (M, * TA, TK,)<br>\
and به ↓ أَسْوَيْتُهُ; I made it uniform, or equal,<br>\
with it; or like it: (M, K, TA:) and ↓ سَاوَيْتُ<br>\
هٰذَا بِذَاكَ I raised this so as to make it equal in<br>\
measure, or quantity, or amount, with that. (TA.)<br>\
And سَوَّيْتُ بَيْنَهُمَا, and ↓ سَاوَيْتُ, (S, M, K,) I<br>\
made them uniform, or equal, each with the<br>\
other; or like each other. (M, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And<br>\
He made it symmetrical or symmetrically, by, or<br>\
with, a just adaptation of its component parts;<br>\
made it congruous or consistent in its several<br>\
parts, or with congruity or consistency in its<br>\
several parts: he made it, formed it, or fashioned<br>\
it, in a suitable manner: he made it to be<br>\
adapted, or so as to be adapted, to the exigencies,<br>\
or requirements, of its case, or of wisdom: he<br>\
made it complete, or in a complete manner; completed it, or completed its make: he made it<br>\
right or good, or in a right or good manner;<br>\
rectified it; adjusted it; or put it into a right,<br>\
or good, state.] In the Kur xxxii. 8, it means He<br>\
made him symmetrical [or symmetrically], by the<br>\
fit, or suitable, formation of his members. (Bd,)<br>\
And سَوَّيْتُهُ in the same, xv. 29 and xxxviii. 72,<br>\
I made his creation symmetrical: (Bd:) or I<br>\
completed him, or made him complete. (Jel.)<br>\
And سَوَّى in the same, lxxxvii. 2, He made what<br>\
He created congruous or consistent in the several<br>\
parts. (Jel.) And الَّذِى خَلَقَكَ فَسَوَّاكَ, in the<br>\
same [lxxxii. 7], means [Who created thee,] and<br>\
made thy creation to be adapted to the exigencies,<br>\
or requirements, of wisdom. (TA.) وَنَفْسٍ وَمَا<br>\
سَوَّاهَا, in the same, [xci. 7, means By a soul and<br>\
what made it to be adapted to its exigencies, i. e., to<br>\
the performance of its functions, for it] is indicative<br>\
of the faculties of the soul: this explanation is more<br>\
proper than that which makes ما to mean [Him<br>\
who, i. e.] God. (TA.) And رَفَعَ سَمْكَهَا فَسَوَّاهَا,<br>\
in the same, lxxix. 28, means He hath raised<br>\
high [its canopy, or] the measure of its elevation<br>\
from the earth, or its thickness upwards, and<br>\
made it symmetrical, or even, (Bd,) or completed<br>\
it by adorning it with the stars, (Bd, TA, *)<br>\
agreeably with what is said in the Kur xxxvii. 6,<br>\
(TA,) and by means of the revolvings [thereof],<br>\
&amp;c.: from the saying next following. (Bd.) سوّى<br>\
فُلَانٌ أَمْرَهُ Such a one rectified, or adjusted, his<br>\
affair; or put it into a right, or good, state.<br>\
(Bd in lxxix. 28.) [Hence,] one says, سَوِّ وَلَا<br>\
تُسَوِّئْ Rectify thou, and do not corrupt, or mar.<br>\
(A and TA in art. سوأ.) [One says also, سوّى<br>\
الطَّعَامَ He cooked the food thoroughly: see 8 as<br>\
its quasi-pass.] And سوّى فُلَانٌ مَنْصُوبَةً [Such a<br>\
one framed a stratagem, or plot]. (TA in art.<br>\
نصب.)<br>\
-A2-  سَوَّى [as an intrans. verb, if not a mistranscription for سُوِّىَ], inf. n. as above: see 8.<br>\
-A3-<br>\
And سُوِّىَ, [app. for سُوِّئَ,] inf. n. as above, signifies It was, or became, altered [for the worse];<br>\
syn. غُيِّرَ. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
ساواهُ, (S, * M, * Msb,) inf. n. مُسَاوَاةٌ (M, Er-Rághib, Msb, TA) and سِوآءٌ, (M,) It was, or became, equal to it, (S, Er-Rághib, Msb, TA,) and<br>\
like it, in measure, extent, size, bulk, quantity, or<br>\
amount, and in value, (Msb, TA,) or in linear<br>\
measure, and in weight, and in the measure of<br>\
capacity, [as well as in value:] one says هٰذَا<br>\
لِذٰلِكَ الثَّوْبِ ↓ الثَّوْبُ مُسَاوٍ [This garment, or piece<br>\
of cloth, is equal in length and breadth to that<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth]; and هٰذَا الثَّوْبُ<br>\
لِذٰلِكَ الدِّرْهَمِ ↓ مُسَاوٍ [This garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth, is equivalent to that dirhem]: and sometimes it means in mode, or manner of being: one<br>\
says, لِذٰلِكَ السَّوَادِ ↓ هٰذَا السَّوَادُ [This blackness is equal in quality to this blackness]. Er-Rághib, TA.) It is said in a trad., سَاوَى الظِّلُّ<br>\
التِّلَالَ The shade, or shadow, was like, in its<br>\
extent, to the mounds, in their height. (TA.) [And<br>\
ساوى الشَّىْءُ رَأْسَهُ means The thing equalled in<br>\
height his head: see an ex. of the verb tropically<br>\
used in this sense voce سِىٌّ.] One says also, هٰذَا<br>\
يُسَاوِى دِرْهَمًا This is worth, or equal in its value<br>\
to, a dirhem: and in a rare dial., one says,<br>\
دِرْهَمًا ↓ سَوِىَ, aor. يَسْوَاهُ; (Msb, TA;) which AZ<br>\
disallows, saying, one says ساواه, but not يَسْوَاهُ.<br>\
(Msb.) And هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ لَا يُسَاوِى كَذَا This thing<br>\
is not equivalent to [or is not worth] such a thing:<br>\
(Fr, S:) or لَايُسَاوِى شَيْئًا [It (a garment, or some<br>\
other thing, M) is not worth anything]: (M, K:)<br>\
↓ لا يَسْوَى is of a rare dial., (K,) unknown to Fr,<br>\
(S,) disallowed by A&#39;Obeyd, but mentioned by<br>\
others: (M:) Az says that it is not of the language<br>\
of the Arabs [of pure speech], (Msb, TA,) but is<br>\
post-classical; and in like manner ↓ لا يُسْوِى is<br>\
not correct Arabic: this last is with damm to the<br>\
[first] ى: MF says that the generality of authorities disallow it, and the Fs expressly disallows it,<br>\
but the expositors thereof say that it is correct and<br>\
chaste, of the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz,<br>\
though an instance of a verb of which the aor. only<br>\
is used. (TA.) One says likewise, ساوى الرَّجُلُ قِرْنَهُ<br>\
The man equalled his opponent, or competitor, in<br>\
knowledge, or in courage. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 6.<br>\
-A2-  And see 2, in four places, in the former half<br>\
of the paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
اسوى as a trans. verb: see 2, in two places,<br>\
in the former half of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  لَايُسْوِى<br>\
in the sense of لَايُسَاوِى is not correct Arabic:<br>\
see 3, in the latter part of the paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  As<br>\
an intrans. verb: see 8. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He was like his<br>\
son, or offspring, [in some copies of the K his<br>\
father, which, as is said in the TA, is a mistake,]<br>\
in make, (M, K,) or in symmetry, or justness of<br>\
proportion; (Fr, TA;) or simply he was like his<br>\
son, or offspring. (M.) [In this instance, and in<br>\
all the senses here following that are mentioned<br>\
in the K, the verb is erroneously written in the<br>\
CK استوى.] ―<br>\
-b3-  اسوى فِى المَرْأَةِ i. q. أَوْعَبَ, (M,<br>\
K, TA,) i. e. He inserted the whole of his ذَكَر<br>\
into the فَرْج [of the woman]. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, [as<br>\
though originally أَسْوَأَ,] He was, or became, base,<br>\
abased, object, vile, despicable, or ignominious;<br>\
syn. خَزِىَ; (M, K;) from السَّوْأَةُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
He voided his ordure; syn. أَحْدَثَ; (Az, M,<br>\
K;) [likewise] from السَّوْأَةُ, as meaning “ the<br>\
anus. ” (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, in the opinion<br>\
of Az, and thought by J to be originally أَسْوَأَ [as<br>\
he says in the S], (TA,) [though trans.,] He<br>\
dropped, left out, omitted, or neglected, (S, M,<br>\
K,) and did so through inadvertence, (S, K,) a<br>\
thing, (S,) or a letter, or word, of the Kur-án,<br>\
(M, K,) or a verse thereof: (M:) mentioned by<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd: (S:) and in like manner, accord. to<br>\
IAth, in reckoning, and in shooting, or casting:<br>\
and Hr says that أَشْوَى, with ش, is allowable, as<br>\
meaning أَسْقَطَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also He was, or became, affected with بَرَص [or leprosy, which is<br>\
sometimes termed السُّوْءُ; so that the verb in this<br>\
sense also seems to be originally أَسْوَأَ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And He was, or became, restored to health, [or<br>\
free from سُوْءٌ as meaning an evil affection, (as<br>\
though the verb were in this sense likewise<br>\
originally أَسْوَأَ, the incipient أ being privative, as<br>\
it is in many other instances, like the Greek<br>\
privative<br>\
α,)] after a disease, or malady. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  أَسْوَيْتُهُ بِهِ: see Q. Q. 1 in art. اسو.<br>\
5<br>\
تَسَوَّىَ see 8.<br>\
6<br>\
تَسَاوَيَا They two were, or became, equal, like<br>\
each other, or alike; as also ↓ اِسْتَوَيَا. (M, K.)<br>\
↓ استوى has two and more agents assigned to it:<br>\
one says, استوى زَيْدٌ وُعَمْرُو وَخَالِدٌ فِى هٰذَا [Zeyd<br>\
and &#39;Amr and Khálid were equal, or alike, in<br>\
this]; i. e. تَسَاوَوْا: whence the saying in the Kur<br>\
[ix. 19], عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ ↓ لَا يَسْتَوُونَ [They will not be<br>\
equal, or alike, in the sight of God]. (TA.) And<br>\
one says, تَسَاوَوْا فِى المَالِ They were, or became,<br>\
equal in respect of the property, none of them<br>\
exceeding another; as also فِيهِ ↓ اِسْتَوَوْا. (Msb.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., as some relate it, ↓ مَنْ سَاوَى<br>\
يَوْمَاهُ فَهُوَ مَغْبُونٌ, in which the meaning is said to<br>\
be تَسَاوَى [i. e. He whose two days are alike,<br>\
neither being distinguished above the other by<br>\
any good done by him, is weak-minded]. (TA.)<br>\
And in another it is said, لَا يَزَالُ النَّاسُ بِخَيْرٍ مَا<br>\
تَفَاضَلُوا فَإِذَا تَسَاوَوْا هَلَكُوا, (S, * TA,) i. e. [Men<br>\
will not cease to be in a good state while they vie<br>\
in excellence,] but when they cease from vying in<br>\
excellent qualities and are content with defect<br>\
[and thus become alike, they perish]: or when<br>\
they become equal in ignorance: or when they<br>\
form themselves into parties and divisions, and<br>\
every one is alone in his opinion, and they do not<br>\
agree to acknowledge one exemplar or chief or<br>\
leader [so that they are all alike]: or, accord. to<br>\
Az, when they are alike in evil, there being none<br>\
among them possessed of good. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
استوى [seems, accord. to Bd, to signify<br>\
primarily He sought, or desired, what was equal,<br>\
equable, uniform, even, or the like: for he says<br>\
(in ii. 27) that the primary meaning of الاِسْتِوَآءُ<br>\
is طلَبُ السَّوَآءِ; app. indicating the sense in which<br>\
السوآء is here used by what follows. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,<br>\
accord. to him, but I would rather say primarily,<br>\
as being quasi-pass. of سَوَّاهُ,] It was, or became,<br>\
equal, equable, uniform, even, level, flat, plane or<br>\
plain, [or equal in respect of elevation or of depression, (see 2, first sentence,)] straight, right,<br>\
direct, or rightly directed; syn. اِعْتَدَلَ (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K, TA, and Ksh and Bd in ii. 27) فِى ذَاتِهِ,<br>\
(TA,) said of a place, (Msb,) and اِسْتَقَامَ, said of<br>\
a stick, or piece of wood, &amp;c. (Ksh ubi suprà.)<br>\
And ↓ سَوَّى, [if not a mistranscription for سُوِّىَ,]<br>\
inf. n. تَسْوِيَةٌ, signifies the same as استوى [app.<br>\
meaning as above], accord. to IAar; and so does<br>\
↓ أَسْوَى, as also أَوْسَى, formed from it by transposition. (TA.) One says, اِسْتَوَتْ بِهِ الأَرْضُ [lit.<br>\
The earth, or ground, became equable, uniform,<br>\
even, &amp;c., with him, he having been buried in it],<br>\
meaning he perished in the earth; as also<br>\
↓ تَسَوَّتْ, and عَلَيْهِ ↓ سُوِّيَتْ. (M, K.) And استوت<br>\
أَرْضُهُمْ Their land became [even in its surface,<br>\
being] affected with drought, or barrenness. (M, *<br>\
TA.) And استوى المَآءُ وَالخَشَبَةَ, meaning مَعَ<br>\
الخَشَبَةِ [i. e. The water became even, or level, with<br>\
the piece of wood]. (TA.) See also 6, in four<br>\
places. One says also, استوى المُعَوَّجُ [or المُعْوجُّ<br>\
(as in the MA) i. e. The crooked, or uneven,<br>\
became straight, or even]: (Mgh:) and استوى<br>\
مِنِ اعُوِجَاجٍ [It became even from a state of unevenness]. (S.) فَاسْتَوَى عَلَى سُوقِهِ, in the Kur<br>\
xlviii. last verse, means And has stood straight,<br>\
or erect, (Bd,) or become strong, and stood<br>\
straight, or erect, (Jel,) upon its stems. (Bd,<br>\
Jel. [Golius erroneously assigns a similar meaning to استسوى, a verb which I do not anywhere<br>\
find.]) And فَاسْتَوَى in the same, liii. 6, And he<br>\
stood straight, or erect, in his proper form in<br>\
which God created him: or was endowed by his<br>\
strength with power over the affair appointed to<br>\
him: (Bd:) or became firm, or steady. (Jel.)<br>\
استوى said of a stick &amp;c. means It stood up or<br>\
erect: and was, or became, even, or straight:<br>\
hence one says, استوى إِلَيْهِ كَالسَّهْمِ المُرْسَلِ He,<br>\
or it, went towards him, or it, with an undeviating,<br>\
a direct, or a straight, course, like the arrow hot<br>\
forth: and hence, ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى إِلَى السَّمَآءِ is metaphorically said of God, in the Kur ii. 27 [and xli.<br>\
10]; (Ksh;) meaning (tropical:)  Then He directed himself<br>\
by his will to the [heaven, or] elevated regions,<br>\
(Ksh, Bd,) or upwards, (Ksh,) or to the heavenly<br>\
bodies; (Bd;) syn. عَمَدَ, (Zj, M, K,) and قَصَدَ<br>\
(Zj, S, M, K, and Ksh and Bd) بِإِرَادَتِةِ; (Ksh,<br>\
Bd;) for when الاِسْتِوَآءُ is trans. by means of إِلَى<br>\
it imports the meaning of the directing of oneself,<br>\
or, as in this case, of one&#39;s design: (TA;) you<br>\
say of any one who has finished a work and has<br>\
directed himself to another, قَدِ اسْتَوَى لَهُ and إِلَيْهِ:<br>\
(Har p. 631:) or the meaning here is صَعِدَ, (Zj,<br>\
M, K,) or صَعِدَ أَمْرُهُ [i. e. his command ascended];<br>\
(M;) and this is what is intended here by صَعِدَ:<br>\
(TA:) or أَقْبَلَ عَلَيْهَا [i. e. He advanced to it,<br>\
namely, the heaven]; (Fr, Th, M, K;) like as one<br>\
says, كَانَ فُلَانٌ مُقْبِلًا عَلَى فُلَانٍ ثُمَّ اسْتَوَى عَلَىَّ<br>\
يُشَاتِمُنِى and إِلَىّض also, meaning أَقْبَلَ [i. e. Such a<br>\
one was advancing against such a one, then he<br>\
advanced against me, and to me, reviling me, or<br>\
contending with me in reviling]: (TA:) or it<br>\
means اِسْتَوْلَى, (M, K,) as some say: (M:) J<br>\
says, [in the S,] but not explaining thereby the<br>\
verse above cited, that it signifies also اِسْتَوْلَى and<br>\
ظَهَرَ [as meaning He had, or gained, the mastery,<br>\
or victory]: and hence the saying of El-Akhtal,<br>\
cited by him [in the S,]<br>\
قَدِ اسْتَوَى بِشْرٌ عَلَى العِرَاقِ<br>\
مِنْ غَيْرِ سَيْفٍ وَدَمٍ مُهْرَاقِ<br>\
[Bishr has gained the mastery over El-&#39;Irák<br>\
without sword and without shed blood]: Er-Rághib says that when this verb is trans. by<br>\
means of عَلَى, it imports the meaning of الاِسْتِيلَآء;<br>\
as in the saying in the Kur [xx. 4], اَلرَّحْمٰنُ عَلَى<br>\
الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَى [which may be rendered, The Compassionate hath ascendancy over the empyrean so<br>\
as to have everything in the universe equally<br>\
within his grasp; agreeably with what here<br>\
follows]: he then adds, it is said to mean that<br>\
everything is alike in relation to Him in such<br>\
manner that no one thing is nearer to Him<br>\
than another thing, since He is not like the<br>\
bodies that abide in one place exclusively of another place. (TA.) The saying لَمَّا اسْتَوَتْ بِهِ<br>\
رَاحِلَتُهُ عَلَى البَيْدَآءِ means [When his riding-camel]<br>\
ascended with him upon the desert: or stood up<br>\
with him straight upon its legs. (Mgh.) And<br>\
one says, استوى عَلَى ظَهْرِ دَابَّتِهِ, (S, TA,) or<br>\
عَلَى الفَرَسِ, (Msb,) He was, or became, firm, or<br>\
steady, [or he settled himself, or became firmly<br>\
seated, or sat firmly,] upon the back of his beast,<br>\
or upon the horse: (S, Msb, TA:) and استوى<br>\
جَالِسًا [He became firm, or steady, sitting; or he<br>\
settled himself in his sitting place; or sat firmly].<br>\
(Msb.) [استوى as quasi-pass. of سَوَّاهُ also signifies It was made, or became, symmetrical; congruous, or consistent in its several parts: was<br>\
made, formed, or fashioned, in a suitable manner:<br>\
was made, or became, adapted to the exigencies,<br>\
or requirements, of its case, or of wisdom: was<br>\
made, or became, complete: was made, or became,<br>\
right, or good; became rectified, adjusted, or put<br>\
into a right or good state. And hence,] استوى<br>\
الرَّجُلُ i. q. بَلَغَ أَشُدَّهُ [q. v.]; (M, K;) [generally<br>\
meaning] The man [became full-grown, of full<br>\
vigour, or mature, in body, or in body and intellect; i. e.] attained the utmost limit of [the<br>\
period termed] his شَبَاب; (S;) or attained the<br>\
utmost limit of his شَبَاب, and the completion of<br>\
his make and of his intellect, by the completion of<br>\
from twenty-eight to thirty [years]: (T, TA:)<br>\
or attained to forty (T, M, K) years. (K.) And<br>\
استوى الطَّعَامُ The food became thoroughly cooked.<br>\
(Msb.) [خَطُّ الاِسْتِوَآءِ means The equinoctial line.]<br>\
سَىٌّ, [app. a dial. var. of سِىٌّ]: see لَا سِيَّمَا, in<br>\
the next paragraph.<br>\
سِىٌّ, originally سِوْىٌ; and its dual: see سَوَآءٌ,<br>\
in ten places, all except one in the latter half of<br>\
the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] of him who is, or<br>\
has become, in a state of wealth, or welfare, [or<br>\
rather, of abundant wealth or welfare,] one says,<br>\
هُوَ فِى سِىِّ رَأْسِهِ and رَأْسِهِ ↓ سَوَآءِ, (Fr, S,) or وَقَعَ<br>\
فِى سِىِّ رَأْسِهِ [in the CK (erroneously) سَىِّ] and<br>\
رأسه ↓ سَوَآءِ (M, K) and رأسه ↓ سِوَآءِ, (K,) or وَقَعَ<br>\
رأسه ↓ مِنَ النِّعْمَةِ فِى سِوَآءِ, (Ks, M,) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [He is<br>\
in, or has lighted upon, or come upon,] what is in<br>\
the predicament of his head (حُكْمِ رَأْسِهِ) [in point<br>\
of eminence, of wealth, or welfare]: or what<br>\
covers his head [thereof]: (M, K:) or what<br>\
equals his head [in eminence] (يُسَاوِى رَأْسَهُ), of<br>\
wealth, or welfare: (T, TA:) or what has equalled<br>\
his head [in eminence], of wealth, or welfare; i. e.<br>\
what has accumulated upon him, and filled [or<br>\
satisfied] him: (M:) or [what equals] the number<br>\
of the hairs of his head, of wealth, or good;<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, S, K;) as some explain it. (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
S.) See also سِنٌّ, last sentence but one. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence likewise,] لَا سِيَّمَا, (S, M, Msb, K,) also<br>\
pronounced لا سِيَمَا, without teshdeed, (Msb,<br>\
Mughnee, K,) and ↓ لا سَيَّمَا is a dial. var. thereof,<br>\
(Msb,) a compound of سِىّ and مَا, denoting exception: (S:) one says, لَا سِيَّمَا زَيْدٍ, i. e. لَا مِثْلَ<br>\
زَيْدٍ [lit. There is not the like of Zeyd; virtually,<br>\
and generally, meaning above all Zeyd, or especially Zeyd]; مَا being redundant: and لا سيّما<br>\
زَيْدٌ also; like as one says, دَعْ مَا زَيْدٌ: (M, K:)<br>\
[J says,] with respect to the case of the noun<br>\
following ما, there are two ways: you may make<br>\
مَا to be in the place of الَّذِى, and mean that an<br>\
inchoative is to be understood, [namely, هو or the<br>\
like,] and put the noun that you mention in the<br>\
nom. case as the enunciative; thus you may say,<br>\
جَآءَنِى القَوْمُ لَا سِيَّمَا أَخُوكَ, meaning لَا سِىَّ الَّذِى<br>\
هُوَ أَخُوكَ [i. e. The people, or party, came to me,<br>\
and there was not the like of him who is thy<br>\
brother; or above all, or especially, he who is thy<br>\
brother]: (S, TA: [thus in a copy of the S: in<br>\
other copies of the same, and in the TA, for<br>\
سِىَّ, سِيَّمَا:]) but this rendering is invalidated<br>\
in such a phrase as وَلَا سِيَّمَا زَيْدٌ by the supression of the correlative of the noun in the nom.<br>\
case where there is no lengthiness, and by the<br>\
applying ما to denote a rational being: (Mughnee:) or you may put the noun after it in the<br>\
gen. case, making ما redundant, and making سِىّ<br>\
to govern the noun in that case because the meaning of سِىّ is مِثْل: [and this is the preferable<br>\
way:] (Mughnee:) in both of these ways is<br>\
recited the saying of Imra-el-Keys,<br>\
أَلَا رُبَّ يُوْمٍ لَكَ مِنْهُنَّ صَالِحٍ<br>\
وَلَا سِيَّمَا يَوْمٌٍ بِدَارَةِ جُلْجُلِ<br>\
[Verily many a good day was there to thee by<br>\
reason of them; but there was not the like of a<br>\
day, or above all a day, or especially a day, at<br>\
Dárat Juljul, a certain pool, where Imra-el-Keys<br>\
surprised his beloved, &#39;Oneyzeh, with others, her<br>\
companions, bathing: see EM pp. 9 and 10]: you<br>\
say also, أَضْرِبُ القَوْمَ وَلَا سِيَّمَا أَخِيكَ, meaning وَلَا<br>\
مِثْلَ ضَرْبِ أَخِيكَ [i. e. I will beat the people, or<br>\
party, but there shall not be the like of the beating of thy brother]: and if you say, وَلَا سِيَّمَا أَخُوكَ,<br>\
the meaning is, وَلَا مِثْلَ الَّذِى هُوَ أَخُوكَ [and there<br>\
shall not be the like of him who is thy brother]:<br>\
in the saying إِنَّ فُلَانًا كَرِيمٌ وَلَا سِيَّمَا إِنْ أَتَيْتَهُ<br>\
قَاعِدًا, accord. to Akh, ما is a substitute for the<br>\
affixed pronoun هُ, which is suppressed; the meaning being, وَلَا مِثْلَهُ إِنْ أَتَيْتَهُ قَاعِدًا [i. e. Verily<br>\
such a one is generous, and there is not the like<br>\
of him if thou come to him sitting]: (S, TA:)<br>\
it is said in the Msb, [after explaining that ما in<br>\
سيّما may be redundant, and the noun after it<br>\
governed in the gen. case as the complement of a<br>\
prefixed noun; and that ما may be used in the<br>\
sense of الّذى, and the noun following put in the<br>\
nom. case as the enunciative of the inchoative هو<br>\
which is suppressed;] that, accord. to some, the<br>\
noun following may be in the accus. case, as<br>\
being preceded by an exceptive; [or, as a specificative; (Mughnee;) in which case we must regard ما as a substitute for the affixed pronoun هُ;]<br>\
but that this is not a good way; [and in this case,<br>\
accord. to the generality of the authorities, it must<br>\
be an indeterminate noun, not, like زَيْدٌ, determinate: (Mughnee:)] also that سيّما should not<br>\
be used without لا preceding it: and that it<br>\
denotes the predominance of what follows it over<br>\
what precedes it: but it is added that لا is sometimes suppressed [as is said in the Mughnee]<br>\
because known to be meant, though this is rare.<br>\
(TA.) One says also, لَاسِىَّ لِمَا فُلَانٌ (Lh, M,<br>\
K) i. e. There is not the like of such a one: (TA:)<br>\
and لَا سِيَّكَ مَا فُلَانٌ (Lh, M, K) i. e. Such a one<br>\
is not the like of thee. (TA.) [In both of these<br>\
instances, ما is obviously redundant. Other<br>\
(similar) usages of سِىّ are mentioned voce سَوَآءٌ,<br>\
to which reference has been made above.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
سِىٌّ also signifies A [desert such as is termed]<br>\
مُفَازَة; (S, M, K) because of the evenness of its<br>\
routes, and its uniformity. (TA.) [Hence السِّىُّ<br>\
is the name of a particular tract, said in the M to<br>\
be a certain smooth place in the بَادِيَة.] ―<br>\
-b5-  See<br>\
also art. سيو.<br>\
سِيَّة: see سَوَآء, near the end of the paragraph.<br>\
سُوًى: see سَوَآءٌ, in seven places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see<br>\
also سِوًى, in two places.<br>\
سِوًى: see سَوَاءٌ, in seven places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, and<br>\
likewise ↓ سُوًى, (Akh, S, Msb, Mughnee, K,)<br>\
and ↓ سَوَآءٌ, (Akh, S, M, Mughnee, K,) and ↓ سِوَآءٌ,<br>\
(Mughnee,) i. q. مَكَانٌ, (Mughnee,) or غَيْرٌ, (Akh,<br>\
S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) accord. to different<br>\
authorities: each used as an epithet, and as denoting exception, like غَيْر; accord. to Ez-Zejjájee<br>\
and Ibn-Málik, used in the same sense and manner<br>\
as غَيْر: but accord. to Sb and the generality of<br>\
authorities, an adv. n. of place, always in the<br>\
accus. case, except in instances of necessity:<br>\
(Mughnee:) one says, عِنْدِى رَجُلٌ سِوَى زَيْدٍ,<br>\
meaning بَدَلَ زَيْدٍ and مَكَانَ زَيْدٍ [i. e. I have with<br>\
me a man instead of Zeyd and in the place of<br>\
Zeyd]: (Ham p. 570, and TA: *) [but] one says<br>\
[also] مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ سِوَاكَ and ↓ سُوَاكَ and ↓ سَوَائِكَ,<br>\
meaning غَيْرِكَ [i. e. I passed by a man other than<br>\
thee]: (S:) and ↓ جَآءَنِى سَوَاؤُكَ [and سِوَاك &amp;c.<br>\
Other than thou came to me], using it as an<br>\
agent; and ↓ رَأَيْتُ سَوَآءَكَ [and سِوَاكَ &amp;c. I saw<br>\
other than thee], using it as an objective complement: and ↓ مَا جَآءَنِى أَحَدٌ سَوَآءَكَ [and سِوَاكَ &amp;c.<br>\
None except thou came to me]: and مَا جَآءَنِى أَحَدٌ<br>\
↓ سَوَاؤُكَ [and سِوَاكَ &amp;c. None other than thou<br>\
came to me]: (Mughnee:) and قَصَدْتُ القَوْمَ سِوَى<br>\
زَيْدٍ, meaning غَيْرَ زَيْدٍ [i. e. I betook myself to, or<br>\
towards, the people, or party, others than Zeyd,<br>\
which is virtually the same as except Zeyd]:<br>\
(Msb:) and لَئِنْ فَعَلْتَ ذَاكَ وَأَنَا سِوَاكَ لَيَأْتِيَنَّكَ مِنِّى<br>\
مَا تَكْرَهُ, meaning [If thou do that] when I am in<br>\
a land other than thy land, [what thou dislikest,<br>\
or hatest, shall assuredly come to thee from me.]<br>\
(Ibn-Buzurj, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The Arabs also said, عَقْلُكَ<br>\
سِوَاكَ, meaning Thine intellect has departed from<br>\
thee. (IAar, M.)<br>\
-A2-  The strangest of the meanings of سِوَى, in this sense with the short alif and<br>\
with kesr, is قَصْدٌ. (Mughnee.) سِوَى الشَّىْءِ<br>\
means قَصْدُهُ [i. e. The tendency, or direction, of<br>\
the thing]. (M.) And one says, قَصَدْتُ سِوَى<br>\
فُلَانٍ, meaning قَصَدْتُ قَصْدَهُ [i. e. I tended, or<br>\
betook myself, in the direction of, or towards,<br>\
such a one]. (S, K. * [In the CK, and in my<br>\
MS. copy of the K, سَوَاهُ is erroneously put for<br>\
سِوَاهُ.]) And hence, (Mughnee,) a poet says,<br>\
(namely, Keys Ibn-El-Khateem, TA,)<br>\
وَلَأَصْرِفَنَّ سِوَى حُذَيْفَةَ مِدْحَتِى<br>\
[And I will surely turn towards Hodheyfeh my<br>\
eulogy]. (S, Mughnee.)<br>\
سَوَآءٌ [in some copies of the K erroneously<br>\
written without ء] in its primary acceptation is an<br>\
inf. n., [but without a proper verb, used as a<br>\
simple subst.,] meaning Equality, equability,<br>\
uniformity, or evenness; syn. اِسْتِوَآءٌ; (Mughnee;)<br>\
as also ↓ سَوِيَّةٌ: (M, K:) or [rather] it is a subst.,<br>\
(S, and Ksh and Bd in ii. 5,) meaning اِسْتِوَآءٌ,<br>\
(Ksh and Bd ibid.,) from اِسْتَوَى in the sense of<br>\
اِعْتَدَلَ; (S;) and signifies [as above: and] equity,<br>\
justice, or rectitude; syn. عَدْلٌ; (S, M, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ سَوِيَّةً; (M;) and ↓ سِوًى and ↓ سُوًى, as<br>\
well as سَوَآءٌ, accord. to Fr, are syn. with نَصَفٌ;<br>\
and accord. to him, (TA,) and to Akh, (S, TA,)<br>\
syn. with عَدْلٌ; (S, K, TA;) [but app., only syn.<br>\
with عَدْلٌ and نَصَفٌ not as a subst. but as an<br>\
epithet, like وَسَطٌ thus used, as will be shown by<br>\
what follows, although] each said by Er-Rághib<br>\
to be originally an inf. n. (TA.) One says, هُمَا<br>\
مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ ↓ عَلَى سَوِيَّةً, meaning سَوَآءٍ [i. e.<br>\
They two are on an equality, or on a par, in<br>\
respect of this affair, or case]: (S, TA:) and<br>\
↓ هُمْ عَلَى سَوِيَّةٍ, meaning [likewise] اِسْتِوَآءٌ [i. e.<br>\
They are on an equality, or on a par], (M, K,)<br>\
فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ [in this affair, or case]. (M.) And<br>\
↓ قَسَمْتُ الشَّىْءَ بَيْنَهُمَا بِالسَّوِيَّةِ, (S,) meaning بِالعَدْلِ<br>\
[i. e. I divided the thing between them two with<br>\
equity, justice, or rectitude]. (TA.) And it is<br>\
said in the Kur [viii. 60], فَانْبِذْ إِلَيْهِمْ عَلَى سَوَآءٍ,<br>\
meaning عَدْلٍ [as expl. in art. نبذ, q. v.]. (S, *<br>\
TA.) [Hence,] لَيْلَةُ السَّوَآءِ The night of the<br>\
thirteenth [of the lunar month; the first being<br>\
that on which the new moon is first seen]; (As,<br>\
S, K, TA;) in which the moon becomes equable<br>\
or uniform (يَسْتَوِى) [in illumination]: (TA:)<br>\
or the night of the fourteenth. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
i. q. وَسَطٌ [as meaning The middle, or midst, of a<br>\
thing]; (S, M, Mughnee, K;) as also ↓ سُوًى and<br>\
↓ سِوًى. (Lh, M, K.) Hence, سَوَآءُ الشَّىْءِ The<br>\
middle, or midst, of the thing; (S, M;) as also<br>\
↓ سُوَاهُ and ↓ سِوَاهُ. (Lh, M.) It is said in the<br>\
Kur [xxxvii. 53,] فَرَآهُ فِى سَوَآءِ الْجَحِيمِ [And he<br>\
shall see him] in the middle or midst [of the fire of<br>\
Hell]. (S, * Mughnee, TA.) In like manner also<br>\
one says سَوَآءُ السَّبِيلِ [The middle of the road]:<br>\
or, accord. to Fr, it means the right direction of<br>\
the road or way. (TA.) And one says, اِنْقَطَعَ<br>\
سَوَائِى, meaning My waist [broke], or my middle.<br>\
(TA.) And سَوَآءُ النَّهَارِ means The middle of the<br>\
day. (M, K. [In some copies of the K, مُتَّسَعُهُ<br>\
is erroneously put for مُنْتَصَفُهُ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, perhaps, as being generally the middle or nearly so,]<br>\
The summit of a mountain. (M, K.) And An<br>\
[eminence, or a hill, or the like, such as is termed]<br>\
أَكَمَة: or a [stony tract such as is termed] حَرَّة:<br>\
or the head of a حَرَّة. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also used as<br>\
an epithet; (Mughnee;) and signifies Equal,<br>\
equable, uniform, or even; syn. ↓ مُسْتَوٍ; (M,<br>\
Mughnee, K;) applied in this sense to a place;<br>\
(Mughnee;) as also, thus applied, ↓ سَوِىٌّ, and<br>\
↓ سِىٌّ; (M, K;) or these two signify, thus applied, [like سَوَآءٌ as expl. hereafter,] equidistant in<br>\
respect of its two extremities. (TA.) And as<br>\
syn. with ↓ مُسْتَوٍ, it is applied [to a fem. noun as<br>\
well as to a sing., and] to one and more than one,<br>\
because it is originally an inf. n.; whence the<br>\
phrase لَيْسُوا سَوَآءً [They are not equal; in the<br>\
Kur iii. 109]. (Mughnee.) Using it in this sense,<br>\
one says أَرْضٌ سَوَآءٌ [An even land]: and دَارٌ سَوَآءٌ<br>\
A house uniform (↓ مُسْتَوِيَةٌ) in respect of the<br>\
[appertenances termed] مَرَافِق: and ثَوْبٌ سَوَآءٌ A<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth, equal, or uniform,<br>\
(↓ مُسْتَوٍ,) in its breadth and its length and its<br>\
two lateral edges: but one does not say جَمَلٌ سَوَآءٌ,<br>\
nor حَمَارٌ سَوَآءٌ, nor رَجُلٌ سَوَآءٌ: (M, TA:) though<br>\
one says رَجُلٌ سَوَآءُ البَطْنِ A man whose belly is<br>\
even with the breast: and سَوَآءُ القَدَمِ having no<br>\
hollow to the sole of his foot. (TA.) One says<br>\
also الخَلْقِ ↓ رَجُلٌ سَوِىٌّ, (S, M,) meaning ↓ مُسْتَوٍ<br>\
[i. e. A man uniform in make, or symmetrical;<br>\
or full-grown, of full vigour, or mature in body,<br>\
or in body and intellect: see 8]: (S:) and رَجُلٌ<br>\
↓ سَوِىٌّ A man equally free from excess and deficiency in his dispositions and his make: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or sound in limbs: (TA voce مِرَّةٌ,<br>\
q. v.:) and ↓ غُلَامٌ سَوِىٌّ A boy, or young man,<br>\
uniform in make, or symmetrical, (الخَلْقِ ↓ مُسْتَوِى,)<br>\
without disease, and without fault, or defect:<br>\
(Mgh:) and the fem. is سَوِيَّةٌ. (M.) Accord. to<br>\
Er-Rághib, ↓ السَّوِىُّ signifies That which is preserved from excess and deficiency: and hence<br>\
↓ الصِّرَاطِ السَّوِىِّ [in Kur xx. last verse, as<br>\
though meaning The road, or way that neither<br>\
exceeds, nor falls short of, that which is right];<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA;) the right, or direct, road:<br>\
(Bd, Jel:) and some read السَّوَآءِ, meaning the<br>\
middle, good, road: and السَّوْءِ (Ksh, Bd) i. e. the<br>\
evil, or bad, road: (Bd:) and السُّوْءَى [i. e. most<br>\
evil, or worst; fem. of أَسْوَأُ; for الصِّرَاطُ is fem. as<br>\
well as masc.]: (Ksh, Bd:) [and] ↓ السُّوَىَ, of the<br>\
measure فُعْلَى from السَّوَآءُ, [with which it is syn.,]<br>\
or originally السُّوْءَى [mentioned above]: (K:)<br>\
and ↓ السُّوَىِّ, (Ksh, Bd,) which is dim. of السَّوَآء,<br>\
(Lth, TA,) [or] as dim. of السَّوْء [in which case<br>\
it is for السُّوَىْءِ]. (Ksh, Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] it signifies also Complete: (Mughnee:) you say, هٰذَا<br>\
دِرْهَمٌ سَوَآءٌ (M, Mughnee) This is a complete<br>\
dirhem; (Mughnee;) using the last word as an<br>\
epithet: and سَوَآءً also, using it as an inf. n., as<br>\
though you said اِسْتِوَآءً: and in like manner in the<br>\
Kur xli. 9, some road سَوَآءً; and others, سَوَآءٍ.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Equitable, just, or right; syn.<br>\
عَدْلٌ: used in this sense in the saying in the<br>\
Kur [iii. 57], تَعَالَوْا إِلَى كَلِمَةٍ سَوَآءٍ بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَكُمْ<br>\
[Come ye to an equitable, or a just, or right,<br>\
sentence, or proposition, between us and you].<br>\
(Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And Equidistant, or midway,<br>\
(عَدْلٌ, and وَسَطٌ, S, or نَصَفٌ, Mughnee,) between<br>\
two parties, (S,) or between two places; (Mughnee;) applied as an epithet to a place; as also<br>\
↓ سِوًى and ↓ سُوًى; (S, Mughnee;) of which<br>\
three words the second (سِوًى) is the most chaste;<br>\
(Mughnee;) or the last two signify equal (مُسْتَوٍ)<br>\
in respect of its two extremities; and are used as<br>\
epithets and as adv. ns.; originally, inf. ns. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ↓ مَكَانًا سِوًى and ↓ سُوًى, (M, K,)<br>\
in the Kur xx. 60, accord. to different readings,<br>\
means A place equidistant, or midway, (Ksh,<br>\
Bd, Jel,) between us and thee, (Ksh, Bd,) or to<br>\
the comer from each of the two extremities:<br>\
(Jel:) or مَكَانٌ سِوًى and سُوًى means مُعْلَمٌ [i. e.<br>\
a place marked], (so in a copy of the M and in<br>\
one of the K,) or مَعْلَمٌ, (so in other copies of the<br>\
K and in the TA,) which is for ذُو مَعْلَمٍ, meaning<br>\
having a mark, or sign, by which one is guided,<br>\
or directed, thereto. (MF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Also Equal,<br>\
or alike, in any respect.] One says, مَرَرْتُ بِرَجُلٍ<br>\
سَوَآءٍ وَالعَدَمُ, (M, Mughnee, K,) and وَالعَدَمُ ↓ سِوَآءٍ,<br>\
(K,) and وَالعَدَمُ ↓ سِوًى, and وَالعَدَمُ ↓ سُوًى, (M,<br>\
K,) meaning وُجُودُهُ وَعَدَمُهُ سَوَآءٌ [i. e. I passed by<br>\
a man whose existence and whose non-existence<br>\
are equal, or alike, to me, or in my opinion]:<br>\
(M, K: *) and Sb mentions the phrase, سَوَآءٌ هُوَ<br>\
وَالعَدَمُ [as meaning His existence and his nonexistence are equal, or alike, to me]. (M.) And<br>\
سَوَآءٌ عَلَىَّ قُمْتَ أَوْ قَعَدْتَ [It is equal, or alike, to<br>\
me, that thou stand or that thou sit, or whether<br>\
thou stand or sit; or that thou stand or that thou<br>\
sit is equal, or alike, to me: see Kur ii. 5, and<br>\
the expositions thereof]. (S.) [And ↓ سِوًى is<br>\
used as an adv. n., or as an inf. n. adverbially,<br>\
meaning Alike: see an ex. in a verse cited voce<br>\
سَبْتٌ.] ―<br>\
-b6-  Also A like; a similar person or thing;<br>\
(S, M, K;) and so ↓ سِىٌّ: [each used as masc.<br>\
and fem.; and the former as sing. and dual and<br>\
pl., though having proper dual and pl. forms:]<br>\
the pl. of the former is أَسْوَآءٌ, (S, M, K,) and also,<br>\
(S, * K,) but anomalous, (S,) or [rather] quasi-pl.<br>\
ns., all anomalous, (M,) ↓ سَوَاسِيَةٌ (S, M, K) and<br>\
↓ سَوَاسٍ and ↓ سَوَاسِوَةٌ: (M, K:) and أَسْوَآءٌ is also<br>\
pl. of ↓ سِىٌّ: (TA:) as to ↓ سَوَاسِيَةٌ, Akh says,<br>\
سَوَآءٌ is of the measure فَعَالٌ, and سِيَةٌ may be of<br>\
the measure فِعَةٌ or فِلَةٌ, the former of which is the<br>\
more agreeable with analogy, the و being changed<br>\
into ى in سِيَةٌ because of the kesreh before it, for<br>\
it is originally سِوْيَةٌ; and it is from أَسْوَيْتُ الشَّىْءَ<br>\
meaning “ I neglected the thing: ” [see 4:] (S:)<br>\
accord. to Aboo-&#39;Alee, the ى in سَوَاسِيَةٌ is changed<br>\
from the و in سَوَاسِوَةٌ, in which latter some preserve it to show that it is the final radical: (M:)<br>\
accord. to Fr, سَوَاسِيَةٌ has no sing., and relates only<br>\
to equality in evil: (T, TA:) so in the saying,<br>\
سَوَاسِيَةٌ كَأَسْنَانِ الحِمَارِ<br>\
[Equals like the teeth of the ass]. (TA.) It requires two [or more nouns for its subjects]: you<br>\
say, سَوَآءٌ زَيْدٌ وَعَمْرٌو, meaning ذَوَا سَوَآءٍ [i. e., lit.,<br>\
Two possessors of equality, or likeness, are Zeyd<br>\
and &#39;Amr], (M, K,) because it is [originally] an<br>\
inf. n.: (M:) and هُمَا فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ سَوَآءٌ [They<br>\
two are in this affair, or case, likes]: (S:) and<br>\
هُمَا سَوَاآنِ (S, M, K) and ↓ سِيَّانِ i. e. They two<br>\
are likes: (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K:) and هُمْ سَوَآءٌ and<br>\
أَسْوَآءٌ and ↓ سَوَاسِيَةٌ i. e. They are likes; (S;<br>\
[the first and last of these three are mentioned in<br>\
the Mgh as identical in meaning;]) or, accord.<br>\
to Fr, the last means they are equals in evil, not<br>\
in good: (T, TA:) and ↓ مَاهُوَ لَكَ بِسِىٍّ He is not<br>\
a person like to thee: and مَاهُمْ لَكَ بِأَسْوَآءٍ [They<br>\
are not persons like to thee]: (Lh, M:) and<br>\
↓ مَاهِىَ لَكَ بِسِىٍّ (Lh, M, K *) i. e. She is not a<br>\
person like to thee: (TA:) and مَاهُنَّ لَكَ بِأَسْوَآءٍ<br>\
[They (females) are not persons like to thee]:<br>\
and لِمَنْ فَعَلَ ذَاكَ ↓ لَا سِىَّ [There is not a like to<br>\
him who did that]: and إِذَا فَعَلْتَ ذَاكَ ↓ لَا سِيَّكَ<br>\
[There is not the like of thee when thou doest<br>\
that]: (Lh, M, K:) and فُلَانٍ ↓ لَا سِيَّةَ (K)<br>\
[There is not the like of such a one: in the CK,<br>\
فُلَانٌ: perhaps the right reading is فُلَانٌ ↓ لَا سِيَّكَ<br>\
Such a one is not the like of thee]. سَوَآءٌ and<br>\
↓ سِيَّانِ should not be used with أَوْ in the place of وَ<br>\
except by poetic license: one of the exceptions to<br>\
this rule is the saying of Aboo-Dhu-eyb,<br>\
وَكَانَ سِيَّانِ أَلَّا يَسْرَحُوا نَعَمًا<br>\
أَوْ يَسْرَحُوهُ بِهَا وَاغْبَرَّتِ السُّوحُ<br>\
[And they were two like cases that they should<br>\
not send forth cattle to pasture or send him forth<br>\
with them when the tracts were very dusty by<br>\
reason of drought]. (M.) For two other exs. of<br>\

صَالِحِينَ ↓ مُسْتَوِينَ [as enunciatives of أَصْبَحْنَا or<br>\
أَمْسَيْنَا understood, but I think that مُسْتَوِينَ is a<br>\
mistranscription for مُسْوِينَ], meaning In a good,<br>\
right, state, with respect to our children and our<br>\
cattle. (S, M, TA.)<br>\
