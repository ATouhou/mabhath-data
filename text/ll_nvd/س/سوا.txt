سَآءَ, (Lth, M, Msb, K,) aor. يَسُوْءُ, (Lth, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. سَوْءٌ, (Lth, M,) or سَوَآءٌ, like سَحَابٌ, (K,)<br>\
[but the former is that which is commonly known,]<br>\
It (a thing, Lth, M) was, or became, evil, bad,<br>\
abominable, foul, unseemly, unsightly, or ugly.<br>\
(Lth, M, Msb, K.) It is used in this sense, (IKt,<br>\
TA,) or [rather] is like بِئْسَ, (Bd, Jel,) in the<br>\
Kur [xvii. 34], where it is said, سَآءَ سَبِيلًا [Evil,<br>\
&amp;c., is it as a way of acting]: (IKt, Bd, Jel,<br>\
TA:) which is like the saying, سَآءَ هٰذَا مَذْهَبًا<br>\
[Evil, &amp;c., is this as a way of acting or believing,<br>\
&amp;c.]: the noun being in the accus. case as a<br>\
specificative. (IKt, TA.) And so in the saying,<br>\
سَآءَ مَا فَعَلَ فُلَانٌ صَنِيعًا [Evil, &amp;c., as an action,<br>\
is that which such a one has done]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
One says also, سُؤْتُ بِهِ ظَنًّا, and بِهِ الظَّنَّ ↓ أَسَأْتُ,<br>\
[lit. I was evil in opinion respecting him, or it,<br>\
and I made the opinion respecting him, or it, to<br>\
be evil, each virtually meaning I held, or formed,<br>\
an evil opinion respecting him, or it,] the noun<br>\
being determinate, with the article ال, in the<br>\
latter case, (ISk, S, Msb, TA,) because it is an<br>\
objective complement, for the verb is trans., (IB,<br>\
TA,) and the noun being indeterminate in the<br>\
former case, (IB, Msb, TA,) because it is in the<br>\
accus. case as a specificative; (IB, TA;) but<br>\
some allow it to be indeterminate after ↓ أَسَأْتُ,<br>\
which is here the contr. of أَحْسَنْتُ. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
It is also trans.: (Lth, TA:) you say, سَآءَهُ, (S,<br>\
M, K,) aor. يَسُوْؤُهُ, (S,) inf. n. سَوْءٌ (S, M, K) and<br>\
(??), with damm also, (TA, [and said to be an<br>\
(??)n. in the Ksh and by Bd in ii. 46, but as it is<br>\
(??)entioned as an inf. n. in the S nor in the M<br>\
(??) the K, but is expressly said in all these to<br>\
(??)st., I think that is should be rejected, or<br>\
(??) as a quasi-inf. n. like كَلَامٌ and ثَوَابٌ<br>\
(??) سَوَآةٌ (K) and سَوَآءَةٌ (AZ, M, K) and<br>\
(??), K,) of the measure فَعَالِيَةٌ, like<br>\
(??) M,) and سَوَايَةٌ, (S, M, K,) which<br>\
is a contraction of that next preceding, (Kh, S,<br>\
M,) and مَسَآءٌ (M, K) and مَسَآءَةٌ, (S, M, K,) originally مَسْوَأَةٌ, (Har p. 81,) and مَسَائِيَةٌ, which is<br>\
originally مَسَاوِئَةٌ, (Kh, S, M, K,) and مَسَايَةٌ,<br>\
(S, M, K,) which is a contraction of that next<br>\
preceding, (Kh, S,) and مَسَائِيَّةٌ, (M, K,) this last<br>\
written in the L with two ى s, [i. e. مَسَاييَِةٌ,]<br>\
(TA,) [He did evil to him;] he did to him that<br>\
which he disliked, or hated; (M, K;) he displeased, grieved, or vexed, him; contr. of سَرَّهُ.<br>\
(S.) One says, سُؤْتُ الرَّجُلَ, meaning I displeased,<br>\
grieved, or vexed, the man by what he saw [or<br>\
experienced] from me. (S.) And أَرَدْتُ مَسَآءَتَكَ<br>\
and مَسَائِيَتَكَ [I desired to displease, grieve, or vex,<br>\
thee]. (Lth, TA.) And إِنَّ اللَّيْلَ طَوِيلٌ وَلَا يَسُؤْ<br>\
بَالُهُ [Verily the night is long, and may the state<br>\
thereof not displease, grieve, or vex, me]: meaning لَا يَسُؤْنِى بَالُهُ; and expressing a prayer. (Lh,<br>\
M. [In the TA, in the place of بَالُهُ is put ما له;<br>\
as though meaning مَا لَهُ مِنَ الحَوَادِثِ or the like,<br>\
i. e. its events, or accidents, &amp;c.]) And لَهُ عِنْدِي<br>\
مَا سَآءَهُ وَنَآءَهُ [I have, belonging to him, or I owe<br>\
him, what grieved him, and oppressed him by its<br>\
weight], and مَا يَسُوْؤُهُ وَيَنُوْؤُهُ [what does, or will,<br>\
grieve him, &amp;c.]. (S.) تَرَكَ مَا يَسُوْؤُهُ وَيَنُوْؤُهُ [He<br>\
left, or has left, what will grieve him, and oppress<br>\
him by its weight, on the day of judgment, by the<br>\
responsibility that it has imposed upon him,] is a<br>\
prov., said of him who has left his property to his<br>\
heirs. (Meyd, TA.) It is said that El-Mahboobee<br>\
was possessed of riches; and when death visited<br>\
him, he desired to make a testament; so it was<br>\
said to him, “What wilt thou write? ” and he<br>\
answered, “Write ye, &#39;Such a one,&#39; meaning<br>\
himself, &#39;has left what will grieve him, and oppress him by its weight:&#39; ” i. e., property which<br>\
his heirs will devour, while the burden thereof<br>\
will remain upon him. (Meyd, TA.) [See also 4.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, سُؤْتُ وَجْهَ فُلَانٍ, aor. أَسُوْؤُهُ,<br>\
inf. n. مَسَآءَةٌ and مَسَائِيَةٌ, (Lth, TA,) i. q. قَبَحْتُهُ<br>\
[i. e. I said, May God remove the person (lit.<br>\
the face) of such a one far from good, or prosperity, &amp;c.]. (TA. [It is said in a copy of the<br>\
M, that سُؤْتُ لَهُ وَجْهَهُ means قَبَّحْتُهُ: but I think<br>\
that the right explanation is قَبَحْتُهُ, without tesh-deed, meaning I said to him, قَبَحَ اللّٰهُ وَجْهَكَ: see<br>\
art. قبح.])<br>\
2<br>\
سوّأ [He corrupted, or marred]. You say,<br>\
سَوِّ وَلَا تُسَوِّئْ Rectify thou, and do not corrupt, or<br>\
mar. (A, TA.) [See also 4.] ―<br>\
-b2-  سوّأ عَلَيْهِ He said<br>\
to him أَسَأْتُ [Thou hast done ill]. (M.) You say,<br>\
سَوَّأْتُ عَلَيْهِ مَا صَنَعَ, (S,) or صَنِيعَهُ, (K,) i. e. فِعْلَهُ,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. تَسْوِئَةٌ and تَسْوِىْءٌ, I discommended to<br>\
him what he had done, or his deed; and said to him<br>\
أَسَأْتَ [Thou hast done ill]. (S, K.) And إِنْ أَسَأْتُ<br>\
فَسَوِّئْ عَلَىَّ [If I do ill, say thou to me, Thou hast<br>\
done ill]. (S.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَسَآءَ, [inf. n. إِسَآءَةٌ,] He did evil, or ill; or<br>\
acted ill; contr. of أَحْسَنَ: (S, M, K:) [and so]<br>\
اسِآء فِى فِعْلِهِ. (Msb.) You say, اسآء إِلَيْهِ (S, K)<br>\
and لَهُ and عَلَيهِ and بِهِ (TA) He did evil or ill,<br>\
or acted ill, to him. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [See also<br>\
أَسْوَى, in several senses, in art. سوي.]<br>\
-A2-  اسآءهُ<br>\
He corrupted it, or marred it; (M, K;) [did it<br>\
ill;] did it not well; namely, a thing. (M.) It<br>\
is said in a prov., أَسَآءَ كَارِهٌ مَا عَمِلَ [An unwilling<br>\
person did ill what he did]; relating to a man<br>\
who was compelled against his will, by another,<br>\
to do a thing, and marred it, or did it not well: it<br>\
is applied to the man who seeks an object of want<br>\
and does not take pains to accomplish it. (M,<br>\
Meyd. *) See also 1, in two places, in the former<br>\
half of the paragraph. [And see 2.]<br>\
8<br>\
استآء He experienced evil, or that which he<br>\
disliked or hated, (S, * K, TA,) or displeasure,<br>\
(TA,) or grief, or anxiety. (M, TA.) اِسْتَآءَ لَهَا<br>\
occurs in a trad. as meaning He (the Prophet)<br>\
became displeased, or grieved, or anxious, on<br>\
account of it; i. e., on account of a dream that<br>\
had been related to him: or, accord. to one relation, the right reading is اِسْتَآلَهَا, meaning “ he<br>\
sought the interpretation of it, by consideration. ”<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
سَوْءٌ is an inf. n. of سَآءَ, (Lth, S, M, K,) intrans.,<br>\
(Lth, M,) and trans.: (S, M, K:) and is also used<br>\
as an epithet, applied to a man, (M, Msb, and<br>\
Ham p. 712,) and to an action. (Msb.) You<br>\
say رَجُلُ سَوْءٍ (S, M, Msb, K) [A man of evil<br>\
nature or doings; or] a man who does what is<br>\
evil, displeasing, grievous, or vexatious: (M, TA:)<br>\
and رَجُلُ السَّوْءِ [the man of evil nature or doings<br>\
&amp;c.]: (S, K:) and ذِئْبُ السَّوْءِ [the wolf of evil<br>\
nature &amp;c.], as in a verse cited voce أَحَالَ, in art.<br>\
حول: (S:) and عَمَلُ سَوْءٍ [a deed of evil nature]:<br>\
(M, Msb:) and عَمَلُ السَّوْءِ [the deed of evil<br>\
nature]: (Ham p. 498:) and نَعْتُ سَوْءٍ [an epithet of evil nature]: (O and K in art. سحق:)<br>\
and سَعْفُ سَوْءٍ a bad commodity: (O and TA in<br>\
art. سعف:) and if you make the former word<br>\
determinate [by means of the article ال], you use<br>\
the latter as an epithet [also], (M, * Msb, and<br>\
Ham, p. 712, *) and you say الرَّجُلُ السَّوْءُ [the evil<br>\
man, or the man who does what is evil &amp;c.]:<br>\
(Msb, and Ham p. 712:) and العَمَلُ السَّوْءُ [the<br>\
evil deed]: (Msb:) [this last phrase I hold to be<br>\
correct, regarding السَّوْءُ in this case as originally<br>\
an inf. n. of the intrans. verb سَآءَ, and therefore<br>\
capable of being used as an epithet applied to<br>\
anything; though] IB says that السَّوْءُ used as an<br>\
epithet is applied to a man but not to a deed:<br>\
(TA:) [in what here follows from the S, denying<br>\
the correctness of another phrase mentioned above<br>\
on the authority of lexicologists of high repute,<br>\
there is, in my opinion, an obvious mistranscription, twice occurring, السَّوْءُ for السُّوْءُ, which I<br>\
suppose to have passed from an early copy of that<br>\
work into most other copies thereof, for I find it<br>\
alike in all to which I have had access:] Akh<br>\
says, one should not say الرَّجُلُ السَّوْءُ, though one<br>\
says الحَقُّ اليَقِينُ as well as حَقُّ اليَقِينِ; for السَّوْءُ<br>\
is not the same as الرَّجُلُ, but اليَقِينُ is the same<br>\
as الحَقُّ: he says, also, nor should one say, هٰذَا<br>\
رَجُلُ السُّوْءِ with damm: (S:) [here the expres-<br>\
sion “ with damm ” may perhaps be meant to<br>\
refer to السوء in all of the three instances above;<br>\
not in the last only:] IB says, [in remarking on<br>\
this passage of the S, in which he appears to have<br>\
read السُّوْء, with damm, in all of the three instances,] Akh allows one&#39;s saying رَجُلُ السَّوْءِ and<br>\
رَجُلُ سَوْءٍ, with fet-h to the س in both; but not<br>\
رَجُلُ السُّوْءِ, with damm to the س, because السُّوْءُ<br>\
is a subst., meaning “ harm, injury, hurt, mischief, or damage,” and “ evilness of state or condition; ” and رَجُل is prefixed, as governing a<br>\
gen. case, only to the inf. n.: and he adds that<br>\
one says, هٰذَا الرَّجُلُ السَّوْءُ, not prefixing [the<br>\
former noun to the latter, but using the latter as<br>\
an epithet]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next paragraph, in six places.<br>\
سُوْءٌ is the subst. from سَآءَهُ; (S, M, * K;) [so,<br>\
app., accord. to the generality of the lexicologists;]<br>\
or inf. n. (Ksh and Bd in ii. 46) of سَيِّئٌ, (Ksh<br>\
ibid.,) or of سَآءَ, aor. يَسُوْءُ, (Bd ibid.,) or of سَآءَهُ<br>\
[q. v.]; (TA;) signifying Evilness, badness, abominableness, foulness, or unseemliness; [and displeasingness, grievousness, or vexatiousness;] as,<br>\
for instance, of natural disposition, and of doings:<br>\
(Ksh ubi suprà:) vitious, immoral, unrighteous,<br>\
sinful, or wicked, conduct: [hence, رَمَاهُ بِسُوْءٍ: see<br>\
art. رمي:] anything disapproved, or disallowed;<br>\
or regarded as evil, bad, abominable, foul, or<br>\
unseemly: (S, TA:) [an evil action or event:]<br>\
evilness of state or condition: harm, injury, hurt,<br>\
mischief, or damage: (IB, TA:) anything that<br>\
is mentioned as being سَيِّئ [i. e. evil, &amp;c.]: (Lth,<br>\
TA:) any evil, evil affection, cause of mischief<br>\
or harm or injury, noxious or destructive thing,<br>\
calamity, disease, or malady: (M, K, TA:) [pl.<br>\
أَسْوَآءٌ, accord. to a general rule.] The saying<br>\
مَا أُنْكِرُكَ مِنْ سُوْءٍ means I do not disacknowledge<br>\
thee in consequence of سُوْء [i. e. evilness, &amp;c.,] that I<br>\
have seen in thee, but only in consequence of my<br>\
little knowledge of thee. (S.) لِنَصْرِفَ عَنْهُ السُّوْءَ<br>\
وَالفَحْشَآءَ, in the Kur [xii. 24], is said by Zj to<br>\
mean, [In order that we might turn away from<br>\
him] unfaithfulness to his master, and adultery.<br>\
(M, TA.) And سُوْءُ الحِسَابِ, in the Kur [xiii. 18,<br>\
i. e. The evilness of the reckoning], is expl. by<br>\
him as meaning a reckoning in which no good<br>\
work will be accepted, and no evil work passed<br>\
over; because infidelity will have made the former<br>\
to be of no avail: or, as some say, it means a<br>\
reckoning pursued to the utmost extent, in which<br>\
no evil work will be passed over. (M, TA.) لَا<br>\
خَيْرَ فِى قَوْلِ السُّوْءِ means There is no good in thy<br>\
saying سُوْء [i. e. a thing that is evil; قول being<br>\
here used in its original sense of an inf. n.]: but<br>\
if you say ↓ السَّوْء, [you use قول in the sense of<br>\
مَقُول, and] the meaning is, in evil speech. (TA<br>\
as from the K, but not in the CK nor in my MS.<br>\
copy of the K.) سُوْءٌ accord. to one reading, and<br>\
↓ سَوْءٌ accord. to another, (K, TA, [but all that is<br>\
given in this sentence as from the K is so given<br>\
only on the authority of the TA, not being in the<br>\
CK nor in my MS. copy of the K]) the latter of<br>\
which readings is the more common, (TA,) in the<br>\
phrase دَائِرَةُ السّوء, (K, TA,) in the Kur [ix. 99<br>\
and xlviii. 6], (TA,) mean Defeat, and evil;<br>\
(K, TA;) and trial, or affliction, and torment;<br>\
(TA;) and perdition, and destruction, or corruption: (K, TA:) and in like manner in the<br>\
saying, أُمْطِرَتْ مَطَرَ السّوءِ, (K, TA,) in the Kur<br>\
[xxv. 42]: (TA:) or السُّوْء means harm, injury,<br>\
hurt, mischief, or damage; and evilness of state<br>\
or condition; [as expl. before;] and ↓ السَّوْء, corruption, or destruction, or perdition: (K, * TA:)<br>\
or السُّوْء in the phrase دَائِرَةُ السُّوْءِ means defeat and<br>\
evil; and the reading ↓ السَّوْء is from [i. e. syn.<br>\
with] المَسَآءَة [as inf. n.]. (S. [See also دَائِرَةٌ, in<br>\
art. دور.]) Accord. to Zj, in the saying in the<br>\
Kur [xlviii. 6], ↓ الظَّانِّينَ بِاللّٰهِ ظَنَّ السَّوْءِ, (TA,)<br>\
meaning ظَنَّ الأَمْرِ السَّوْءِ [i. e. Who opine, of God,<br>\
the opining of the evil thing], (Bd,) it is allowable<br>\
to read ظَنَّ السُّوْءِ; (T, TA;) and thus some read<br>\
in this instance: (Jel:) but AM says, in the<br>\
saying in the Kur [xlviii. 12], ↓ وَظَنَنْتُمْ ظَنَّ السَّوْءِ<br>\
[And ye opined the evil opining], it is read only<br>\
with fet-h, and damm to the س is not allowable<br>\
in this instance, for there is in it no meaning of<br>\
trial, or affliction, and torment: (TA:) [for this<br>\
distinction, however, I see no reason; and it is<br>\
not correct; for] السوء is with fet-h and with<br>\
damm to the س in the three sentences [whereof<br>\
this last is one] in which it occurs in this chapter.<br>\
(Jel.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In the Kur vii. 188, it is said to mean<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Diabolical possession; or insanity, or madness.<br>\
(M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  Leprosy, syn. بَرَصٌ, (Lth, S, M,<br>\
K, TA,) is said to be its meaning in the Kur<br>\
xx. 23 and xxvii. 12 and xxviii. 32. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The fire: so in the Kur xxx. 9, accord. to the<br>\
reading السُّوْءَ: (K, TA:) said to mean there Hell:<br>\
but the reading commonly known is ↓ السُّوْءَى.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  Weakness in the eye. (K. [Thus,<br>\
i. e. with damm to the س, in the CK and TK:<br>\
in the TA said to be بالفتح; but this is evidently<br>\
a mistake for بالضمّ.])<br>\
سَىْءٌ: see سَيِّئٌ.<br>\
سَوْءَةٌ The عَوْرَة [or pudendum], (S, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
i. e. (Msb) the فَرْج [which means the same, or<br>\
the external portion of the organs of generation],<br>\
(Lth, M, IAth, Msb, K,) of a man, and of a<br>\
woman: (Lth, Msb, TA:) and the anus: (Az<br>\
and TA in art. سوى:) dual سَوْءَتَانِ: and pl.<br>\
سَوْآتٌ: so called because its becoming exposed to<br>\
men displease [or shames] the owner thereof;<br>\
(Msb;) or because of its unseemliness. (Ham<br>\
p. 510.) In the Kur vii. 19, for سَوْآتِهِمَا, some<br>\
read سَوَاتِهِمَا; and some, سَوَّاتِهِمَا. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In the<br>\
Kur v. 34, it means The dead body, or corpse;<br>\
(Bd, Jel;) because it is deemed unseemly to be<br>\
seen. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Accord. to IAth, the former is the<br>\
primary signification: and hence it is transferred<br>\
to denote Any saying, or action, of which one is<br>\
ashamed when it appears: (TA:) any evil, bad,<br>\
abominable, foul, or unseemly, saying or action;<br>\
(S, K, TA;) as also ↓ سَوْآءُ: (M:) any disgracing<br>\
action or thing: (Lth, TA:) an evil, abominable,<br>\
or unseemly, property, quality, custom, or practics; (K, TA;) as also ↓ سَوْآءُ, or ↓ سَوْءَى; (accord. to different copies of the K; [the latter<br>\
perhaps fem. of ↓ أَسْوَأُ like the former, of the same<br>\
class as دَفْأَى and دَنْأَى, or fem. of ↓ سَوْآنُ, like<br>\
عَطْشَى fem. of عَطْشَانُ;]) or so both of these;<br>\
(TA;) or so ↓ سَوْءَةٌ سَوْآءُ: (S:) [or this last means<br>\
a property, &amp;c., that is very evil &amp;c.] One says,<br>\
سَوْءَةً لِفُلَانٍ May a disgracing action or thing<br>\
befall such a one; [or disgrace, or shame, to such<br>\
a one;] using the accus. case because it is an expression of reviling and imprecation. (Lth, TA.)<br>\
[See also سَيِّئَةٌ and سُوْءَى.] ―<br>\
-b4-  ↓ السَّوْءَةُ السَّوْءَى [or<br>\
↓ السَّوْءَةُ السَّوْآءُ] also means The contrarious wife<br>\
or woman. (TA.)<br>\
سَايَةٌ as used in the saying ضَرَبَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى فُلَانٍ<br>\
سَايَةً is held by some to be originally with ء, and<br>\
of the measure فَعْلَةٌ, from السَّوْءُ; so that the saying means Such a one did to such a one a thing<br>\
that caused displeasure to him; and did evil to<br>\
him: others hold that the saying means such a one<br>\
made a way to do what he desired to such a one;<br>\
in which case, ساية is of the measure فَعْلَةٌ from<br>\
سَوَّيْتُ; originally سَوْيَةٌ, which is changed into<br>\
سَيَّةٌ, and then into سَايَةٌ, in like manner as دِوَّانٌ<br>\
is changed into دِيوَانٌ. (Aboo-Bekr, TA.) [See<br>\
the same word in art. سوى.]<br>\
سَوْءَى: see سَوْءَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
سُوْءَى is [fem. of ↓ أَسْوَأُ, q. v., as meaning More,<br>\
and most, evil, bad, abominable, foul, unseemly,<br>\
unsightly, or ugly: and is also] a subst. signifying an evil, a bad, an abominable, a foul, or an<br>\
unseemly, action; (Msb, TA;) i. q. فَعْلَةٌ سَيِّئَةٌ<br>\
[and سَيِّئَةٌ alone]: in this sense, [as well as in the<br>\
former,] (TA,) contr. of حُسْنَى. (S, M, K, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  In the Kur xxx. 9, (S, TA,) accord. to the<br>\
reading commonly known, (TA,) [as contr. of<br>\
الحُسْنَى,] السُّوْءَى means (assumed tropical:)  The fire (S, K, TA)<br>\
of Hell. (TA.) See also سُوْءٌ, last explanation<br>\
but one.<br>\
سَوْآءُ: see أَسْوَأُ (of which it is said by some to<br>\
be fem.) in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also سَوْءَةٌ, in<br>\
four places.<br>\
خَزْيَانُ سَوْآنُ is [app. an instance of the alteration of the latter of two epithets to assimilate it to<br>\
the former, originally خَزْيَانُ أَسْوَأُ, meaning<br>\
Ashamed, or base, or vile, or ignominious, and<br>\
evil, bad, &amp;c.,] from القُبْحُ. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
سَوْءَةٌ.<br>\
سَيِّئٌ, [originally سَيْوِئٌ (as will be shown below,<br>\
voce سَيِّئَةٌ), then سَيْيِئٌ, and then سَيِّئٌ,] applied to<br>\
a thing [of any kind], (Lth, TA,) Evil, bad,<br>\
abominable, foul, unseemly, unsightly, or ugly;<br>\
(Lth, Msb, TA;) contr. of حَسَنٌ: (Msb:) sometimes contracted into ↓ سَىْءٌ, like as هَيِّنٌ is contracted in هَيْنٌ, and لَيّنٌ into لَيْنٌ; as in the<br>\
saying of Et-Tuhawee,<br>\
وَلَا يَجْزُونَ مِنْ حَسَنٍ مِسَىْءٍ<br>\
وَلَا يَجْزُونَ مِنْ غِلَظٍ بِلِينِ<br>\
[And they will not requite good with evil, nor<br>\
will they requite roughness with gentleness]. (S.)<br>\
You say قَوْلٌ سَيِّئٌ [An evil saying; or] a saying<br>\
that displeases. (M, TA.) And فَعْلَةٌ سَيِّئَةٌ [An<br>\
evil action or deed]. (TA.) And it is said in the<br>\
Kur [xxxv. 41], وَمَكْرَ السَّيِّئِ وَلَا يَحِيقُ الْمَكْرُ السَّيِّئٌ<br>\
إِلَّا بِأَهْلِهِ [And in the plotting of that which is<br>\
evil; but the evil plotting shall not beset any save<br>\
the authors thereof]. (M, TA.) One says also,<br>\
فُلَانٌ سَيِّئُ الاِخْتِيَارِ [Such a one is evil in respect<br>\
of choice, or preference]. (S.) [See also the next<br>\
paragraph.]<br>\
سَيِّئَةٌ [fem. of سَيِّئٌ, q. v.: and also a subst.,<br>\
being transferred from the category of epithets<br>\
to that of substs. by the affix ة], originally<br>\
سَيْوِئَةٌ, (S,) An evil act or action; contr. of حَسَنَةٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) a fault, an offence, or an act of disobedience; or such as is intentional; a sin, a crime,<br>\
or an act of disobedience for which one deserves<br>\
punishment; syn. خَطِيْئَةٌ: (M, K:) pl. سَيِّئَاتٌ.<br>\
(TA.) It is said in a trad., الحَسَنَةُ بَيْنَ السَّيِّئَتَيْنِ<br>\
[The good act is between the two evil acts];<br>\
meaning that the exceeding of the just bounds is<br>\
a سَيِّئَة, and the falling short thereof is a سَيِّئَة, and<br>\
the pursuing a middle course between these two<br>\
is a حَسَنَة. (TA.) [See also سَوْءَةٌ and سُوْءَى.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also; tropically, (tropical:)  The recompense of a سَيِّئَة<br>\
properly so termed [i. e. as expl. above]. (Msb<br>\
in art. مكر.) ―<br>\
-b3-  An evil, or evil accident; a<br>\
calamity; a misfortune; (Ksh in iv. 81;) a<br>\
trial, or an affliction; opposed to حَسَنَةٌ; (Ksh<br>\
and Bd in iv. 80;) scarcity of herbage, or of the<br>\
goods, conveniences, and comforts, of life; straitness of circumstances; and unsuccessfulness; thus<br>\
[likewise] opposed to حَسَنَةٌ in the Kur iv. 80.<br>\
(Er- Rághib, TA in art. حسن.)<br>\
أَسْوَأُ; fem. سُوْءَى: see the latter word. One<br>\
says, هُوَ أَسْوَأُ القَوْمِ He is the most evil, &amp;c., of the<br>\
people, or party; syn. أَقْبَحُهُمْ: and هِىَ السُّوْءَى<br>\
She is the most evil, &amp;c. (Msb.) And the<br>\
[common] people say أَسْوَأُ الأَحْوَالِ, meaning The<br>\
[worst, or] most scanty, and weakest, of states or<br>\
conditions. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  [Also,] applied as an epithet to a man, (El-Umawee, M, TA,) Evil, bad,<br>\
abominable, foul, unseemly, unsightly, or ugly: (ElUmawee, M, K, TA:) fem. ↓ سَوْآءُ, (El-Umawee,<br>\
M, K,) which is thus applied to a woman; (ElUmawee, S, M;) or this is an instance of the<br>\
measure فَععلَآءُ having no [masc. of the measure]<br>\
أَفَعَلُ. (M, TA.) See also سَوْءَةٌ, in four places. It<br>\
is said in a trad. (M, TA) of the Prophet, or of<br>\
&#39;Omar, (TA,) وَلُودٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ حَسْنَآءَ عَقِيمٍ ↓ سَوْآءُ<br>\
[An ugly prolific woman is better than a beautiful<br>\
barren one]. (M, TA.)<br>\
مَسَآءَةٌ an inf. n. of سَآءَهُ: (S, M, K:) and [also a<br>\
subst. signifying An evil, as being] a cause of<br>\
grief or vexation; contr. of مَسَرَّةٌ: originally<br>\
مَسْوَأَةٌ: and therefore the pl. is ↓ مَسَاوٍ, for مَسَاوِئُ;<br>\
(Msb;) signifying also vices, faults, defects, or<br>\
imperfections; (S, Msb, K, TA;) and diseases;<br>\
(S, TA;) and acts of disobedience: (Msb:) so in<br>\
the saying, بَدَتْ مَسَاوِيهِ His acts of disobedience,<br>\
and vices, faults, &amp;c., appeared: (Msb:) and<br>\
الخَيْلُ تَجْرِى عَلَى مَسَاوِيهَا Horses run, notwithstanding their vices, or faults, &amp;c., (S, Meyd, K,)<br>\
and diseases; (S, Meyd;) for their generousness<br>\
impels them to do so: (S, Meyd, K: but omitted<br>\
in the CK:) and in like manner, the ingenuous<br>\
generous man bears difficulties, and defends, or<br>\
protects, what he is bound to defend or protect,<br>\
or to regard as sacred, or inviolable, though he<br>\
be weak, and practises generosity in all circumstances: (Meyd, TA:) or it is applied in relation<br>\
to the protection and defence of what should be<br>\
sacred, or inviolable, or of wives, or women under<br>\
covert, and the members of one&#39;s household, notwithstanding harm, or injury, and fear: or it<br>\
means that one may seek to defend himself by<br>\
means of a man though there be in him qualities<br>\
disapproved: (MF, TA:) but accord. to Lh,<br>\
المَسَاوِى has no proper sing., like المَحَاسِنُ:<br>\
(Meyd, TA: *) accord. to some of the writers on<br>\
inflection, it is the contr. of المَحَاسِنُ, and an<br>\
anomalous pl. of السُّوْءُ, being originally with ء.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَسَاوٍ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
