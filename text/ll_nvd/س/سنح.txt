غَارَةٌ سَنْحَآءُ [app. as meaning An incursion into<br>\
the territory of an enemy taking by surprise],<br>\
accord. to one reading of a trad., is from سَنَحَ<br>\

سَانِحٌ (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ سَنِيحٌ (S, A,<br>\
K) both signify the same, (S, A, K,) applied to<br>\
a gazelle, (S, K, *) or to a bird, (S, A, Msb,)<br>\

the spectator; thus expl. by Ru-beh to Yoo,<br>\
in the presence of AO; i. e. passing from the<br>\
direction of the left hand of the spectator<br>\
towards the direction of his right hand: (S:) or<br>\
coming from the direction of the right side of the<br>\
spectator (Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee, IF, A, L,<br>\
Msb) towards the direction of his left hand;<br>\
turning towards him its left side, which is that<br>\
termed الإِنْسِىُّ: contr. of بَارِحٌ [q. v.]: (Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee, L:) the pl. [of the former]<br>\
is سَوَانِحُ and سَانِحَاتٌ and [of either] سُنُحٌ: and<br>\
this last is also employed to signify auspicious<br>\
and inauspicious gazelles [&amp;c.], accord. to the<br>\
different opinions of the Arabs. (L.) The Arabs<br>\
[who apply the epithet in the latter of the two<br>\
senses first explained] regard the سَانِح as a good<br>\
omen, and the بَارِح as an evil omen; (Aboo-&#39;Amr<br>\
Esh-Sheybánee, S, L;) because one cannot shoot<br>\
at the latter without turning himself: (S in art.<br>\
برح:) but some of them hold the reverse of this:<br>\
(Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee, L:) the people of<br>\
Nejd hold the سانح to be a good omen; but<br>\
sometimes a Nejdee adopts the [contr.] opinion<br>\
of the Hijázee. (IB, TA,) It is said in a prov.,<br>\
مَنْ لِى بِالسَّانِحِ بَعْدَ البَارِحِ [expl. in art. برح].<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is said in Har p. 671 that السَّانِحُ<br>\
also signifies المتطيّر المتفاّل, as though<br>\
meaning The person auguring, or who augurs,<br>\
evil or good, from birds: but I think that the<br>\
right reading is المُتَطَيَّرُ بِهِ وَالمُتَفَأَّلُ بِهِ مِنَ الطُّيُورِ,<br>\
i. e. what is regarded as an evil omen and as a<br>\
good omen, of birds.]<br>\
