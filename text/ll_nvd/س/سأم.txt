not turn away with disgust until ye turn away<br>\
with disgust; like لَا يَمَلُّ حَتَّى تَمَلُّوا, and thus the<br>\

or loathing, and contempt, and cursing, rest upon<br>\
you]: thus related with ء, meaning ye shall turn<br>\
away with disgust from your religion: but commonly related without ء [and with a different<br>\
meaning], as will be stated hereafter [in art.<br>\
