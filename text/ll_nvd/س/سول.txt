سَالَ, aor. يَسَالُ, (Akh, and S, M, Msb, K, all<br>\
in art. سأل,) like خَافَ, aor. يَخَافُ, (Msb and K<br>\
ibid.,) first pers. pret. سِلْتُ, [like خِفْتُ,] (Sb, M<br>\
in the present art., [in the K in this art., erroneously, سَلْتُ,]) and aor. أَسَالُ, (Sb, M and K in<br>\
this art.,) imperative سَلْ, (S, Msb, K, TA, all in<br>\
art. سأل,) dual سَلَا, and pl. سَلُوا, these two<br>\
being irregular, (Msb in that art.,) inf. n. سُوَالٌ,<br>\
(M and K in the present art.,) mentioned by Sb<br>\
and by Th, (M ibid.,) and سِوَالٌ, (M and K ibid.,)<br>\
mentioned by Th, (M ibid.,) i. q. سَأَلَ [He asked,<br>\
&amp;c.], (Akh, and S, M, Msb, K, all in art. سأل,)<br>\
and سَأَلْتُ; a dial. var. of the verb with أ, (Sb, M<br>\
and K in the present art.,) the medial radical<br>\
being originally و, (M and K ibid.,) not a substitute for أ, (M ibid.) as is shown by the phrase<br>\
هُمَايَتَسَاوَلَانِ, (M and K ibid.,) mentioned by<br>\
AZ: (M ibid.:) it is of the dial. of Hudheyl.<br>\
(TA in art. سأل.) [For the pass. (سِيلَ &amp;c.), see<br>\
سَأَلَ.] A certain elegant scholar says,<br>\
سَالَتْ هَذَيْلٌ رَسُولَ اللّٰهِ فَاحِشَةً<br>\
i. e. [Hudheyl] asked of the Apostle of God as a<br>\
thing wished for [something beyond measure evil]:<br>\
it is not from سَأَلَ, [i. e. it is originally سَوِلَ, not<br>\
formed from سَأَلَ by the substitution of ا for أ,]<br>\
as many of the elegant scholars say. (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  سَوِلَ, (M, K,) [aor. يَسْوَلُ,] inf. n. سَوَلٌ,<br>\
(M,) He, or it, was, or became, lax, flaccid, or<br>\
uncompact; or it hung down loosely; was, or<br>\
became, pendent, or pendulous: (M, K:) [or,<br>\
said of a man, he was, or became, flaccid, or pendulous, in the belly, or in the part of the belly<br>\
below the navel; as appears from an explanation of<br>\
أَسْوَلُ and from what here follows:] سَوَلٌ, (S,<br>\
TA,) in the K, erroneously, ↓ سَوْلَة, (TA,) signifies flaccidity, or uncompactness, or pendulousness, (S, K, TA,) of the belly, (K,) and so ↓ تَسَوُّلٌ<br>\
and تَسَوُّنٌ, (TA,) or of the part of the belly below<br>\
the navel; (S, TA;) and of other things, (K,<br>\
TA,) as, for instance, (TA,) of a cloud also.<br>\
(S, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
سَوَّلَتْ لَهُ نَفْسُهُ أَمْرًا, (S,) or كَذَا, (M, K,) or<br>\
الشَّىْءَ, (Msb,) inf. n. تَسْوِيلٌ, (TA,) His soul embellished [or commended] to him (S, M, Msb, * K)<br>\
a thing, or an affair, (S,) or such a thing, (M,<br>\
K,) or the thing: (Msb:) or made it [to appear]<br>\
easy to him, and a light matter in his eyes; from<br>\
سَوَلٌ signifying “ laxness ” or the like: (Bd in<br>\
xii. 18:) the inf. n. signifies the embellishing, a<br>\
thing, and making it to be loved or approved, in<br>\
order that one may do it or say it: (TA:) or the<br>\
soul&#39;s embellishing a thing that is eagerly desired,<br>\
and picturing what is foul thereof as goodly:<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA:) and it is said to be from سُولٌ<br>\
signifying “ an object of a man&#39;s desire, which<br>\
embellishes to the seeker thereof that which is<br>\
false, or vain, and other things of the deceptions<br>\
of the present world. ” (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also,<br>\
يُسَوَّلُ إِلَىَّ كَذَا Such a thing is imaged in the<br>\
mind to me; is an object of fancy to me; or<br>\
seems to me. (L in art. هد.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And سوّل لَهُ said<br>\
of the Devil, He led him into error; or made him<br>\
to err: (M, K:) or facilitated to him the commission of great sins; from سَوَلٌ meaning as expl.<br>\
above in this paragraph: or incited him to indulgence in appetences, or lusts; from السُّولُ meaning<br>\
[by implication] التَّمَنِّى: (Bd in xlvii. 27:) or<br>\
[as though meaning] let down his rope [to him to<br>\
aid in the accomplishment of his desire]. (Ham<br>\
p. 748.)<br>\

هُمَايَتَسَاوَلَانِ [They two ask, or beg, each<br>\
other; i. q. يَتَسَآءَلَانِ, q. v.]: (M, K:) a phrase<br>\
mentioned by AZ. (M.)<br>\
سُولٌ i. q. مَسْأَلَةٌ [as signifying A petition; or a<br>\
request; meaning a thing that is, or has been,<br>\
asked, or begged; see سُؤْلٌ]; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ سُولَةٌ; (K, TA;) each, (TA,) a dial. var. of the<br>\
word with ء: (K, TA: [but it is also said in the<br>\
latter that سُؤْلٌ is the original of سُولٌ because the<br>\
readers of the Kur-án read the word with ء in<br>\
chap. xx. verse 36:]) or an object of desire or<br>\
wish (أُمْنِيَّةٌ), which one asks; (TA:) or an object<br>\
of want, which the soul eagerly desires: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or an object of a man&#39;s desire<br>\
(أُمْنِيَّةٌ), which embellishes to the seeker thereof<br>\
that which is false, or vain, and other things of<br>\
the deceptions of the present world: but there is<br>\
a difference between سُولٌ and ↓ سُولَةٌ on the one<br>\
hand and أُمْنِيَّةٌ on the other hand, in that the<br>\
former relate to what is sought, or demanded,<br>\
and امنيّة relates to what is meditated (قُدِّرَ);<br>\
(TA;) [for] this last primarily signifies “ a thing<br>\
that a man meditates (يُقَدِّرُهُ) in his mind,” from<br>\
مَنَى signifying قَدَّرَ; (Bd in ii. 73;) so that the<br>\
↓ سُولَة seems to be after the أُمْنِيَّة: (TA:) سُولٌ<br>\
may be from سَوَّلَتْ لَهُ نَفْسُهُ كَذَا in the first of the<br>\
senses assigned to it above, and [from] سَوَّلَ said<br>\
of the Devil in the last of the senses assigned to it<br>\
above. (Ham p. 748.) [See also سُوَالٌ, below.]<br>\
سَوْلَةٌ: see 1, last sentence.<br>\
سُولَةٌ: see سُولٌ, in three places.<br>\
سُوَلَةٌ, (M, K,) applied to a man, (M,) One<br>\
who asks, or begs, much; (K;) i. q. [سُؤَلَةٌ and]<br>\
سَؤُولٌ. (M.)<br>\
سُوَالٌ an inf. n. of سَالَ as syn. with سَأَلَ: (Sb,<br>\
Th, M, K:) [and used as a simple subst., like<br>\
سُولٌ and سُولَةٌ, for] IJ mentions أَسْوِلَةٌ as its pl.<br>\
(M, TA.)<br>\
سَوِيلٌ An equal. (M, K.) So in the saying,<br>\
أَنَا سَوِيلُكَ فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ [I am thy equal in this<br>\
affair]. (M.)<br>\
أَسْوَلُ Lax, flaccid, or uncompact; or hanging<br>\
down loosely; or pendent, or pendulous; in the<br>\
lower part: (M, K:) or a man flaccid, or pendulous, in the part of the belly below the navel:<br>\
fem. سَوْلَآءُ: and pl. سُولٌ. (S.) And سَحَابٌ أَسْوَلُ<br>\
Clouds that are uncompact, (S, TA,) their skirts,<br>\
or fringes, hanging down; and in like manner,<br>\
سَحَائِبُ سُولٌ; sing. سَحَابَةٌ سَولَآءُ. (TA.) And<br>\
دَلْوٌ سَوْلَآءُ A large bucket. (M, K. *)<br>\
