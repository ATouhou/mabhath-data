سَبَقَهُ, (S, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
سَبِقَ (O, Msb,<br>\
K) and<br>\
سَبُقَ, (O, K,) but the former is of higher<br>\
authority, or more usual, (O, TA,) inf. n. سَبْقٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb,) He preceded him; he was, or became,<br>\
got, went, or came, before him, or ahead of him;<br>\
he outwent, or outstripped, him; he had, got, or<br>\
took, precedence of him; syn. تَقَدَّمَهُ; (K, TA;)<br>\
in running, and in everything. (TA.) Some<br>\
read, in the Kur [xxi. 27], لَا يَسْبُقُونَهُ بِالقَوْلِ, thus,<br>\
with damm, meaning They say not [anything]<br>\
without his having taught them: (O, TA:) or<br>\
they say not anything until He has said it:<br>\
originally, لَا يَسْبُِقُ قَوْلُهُمْ قَوْلَهُ [their saying does<br>\
not precede his saying]: this reading is from the<br>\
phrase سَابَقْتُهُ فَسَبَقْتُهُ, [expl. below,] aor. of the<br>\
latter أَسْبُقُهُ. (Bd.) See 3. ―<br>\
-b2-  سَبَقَ الفَرَسُ فِى<br>\
الحَلْبَةِ The horse outstripped, or came in first,<br>\
among those started together for a wager, or in<br>\
the race-ground. (O, K.) Hence the trad. of<br>\
&#39;Alee, سَبَقَ رَسُولُ اللّٰهِ وَصَلَّى أَبُو بَكْرٍ وَثَلَّثَ عُمَرُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The Apostle of God came in first in the race,<br>\
and Aboo-Bekr came in next, and &#39;Omar came<br>\
in third]. (O, TA.) [And سَبَقَ used in like<br>\
manner with the objective complement understood means He preceded, &amp;c., as above; and<br>\
hence, he was, or became, first, foremost, or<br>\
beforehand; he had, or got, the priority, or precedence. And He was, or became, one of the<br>\
first or foremost: see سَابِقٌ. See also قَصَبُ السَّبْقِ<br>\
in art. قصب.] ―<br>\
-b3-  سَبَقَ النَّاسَ إِلَى الأَمْرِ [He preceded the other people; was, or became, before<br>\
them; or had, got, or took, precedence of them;<br>\
in betaking, or applying, himself to the affair].<br>\
(S, K.) And in like manner one says, لَهُ سَبْقٌ فِى<br>\
هٰذَا الأَمْرِ To him belongs priority, or precedence,<br>\
in this affair; like سَابِقَةٌ; syn. قُدْمَةٌ. (A, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,] سَبَقَ وَهْمُهُ إِلَى شَىْءٍ فَغَلِطَ فِيهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He<br>\
preconceived a thing, and therefore made a mistake, or erred, respecting it]. (Msb, in explanation of دُخِلَ عَلَيْهِ.) [And سَبَقَ ذِهْنُهُ إِلَى الشَّىْءِ<br>\
means in like manner (assumed tropical:)  He preconceived the<br>\
thing: or his mind adverted hastily, before reflection, or without premeditation, to the thing;<br>\
from what next follows.] ―<br>\
-b5-  سَبَقَ إِلَيْهِمْ He went,<br>\
or passed, hastily, or quickly, to them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
[And hence,] سَبَقَ إِلَيْهِ مِنِّى قَوْلٌ (assumed tropical:)  A saying proceeded hastily, before reflection, or without premeditation, to him from me; syn. فَرَطَ: (S in<br>\
art. فرط:) and سَبَقَ مِنْهُ كَلَامٌ (assumed tropical:)  speech proceeded<br>\
hastily, &amp;c., from him; syn. فَرَطَ: (Msb in that<br>\
art.:) [but this phrase also means, more agreeably<br>\
with the primary signification of the verb, (assumed tropical:)  speech<br>\
proceeded previously from him; (see the Kur<br>\
x. 20, &amp;c.;) and in like manner the former phrase.]<br>\
See also 8. And سَبَقَهُ القَىْءُ, (S, Msb, K, all in<br>\
art. ذرع,) i. e. سَبَقَهُ فِى الخُرُوجِ إِلَى فِيهِ [meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The vomit came forth to his mouth before he<br>\
was aware]. (TA in that art.) [And سَبَقَ القَلَمُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The pen anticipated, skipping over something,<br>\
in transcribing.] ―<br>\
-b7-  One says also, سَبَقْتُ عَلَيْهٍ,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  I overcame him. (TA.) And سَبَقَ<br>\
عَلَى قَوْمِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He overcame his people in generosity.<br>\
(TA.) And سَبَقَهُ فِى الكَرَمِ (assumed tropical:)  He exceeded him in<br>\
generosity. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
سبّق, (inf. n. تَسْبِيقٌ, Mgh,) He took, or received, the سَبَق [i. e. stake, or wager, laid at a<br>\
race or a shooting-match, to be taken by the successful competitor]: (IAar, O, K:) or سَبَّقْتُهُ I<br>\
took, or received, the سَبَق, from him. (Az, Mgh,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He gave the سَبَق: (IAar, O, K:)<br>\
or سَبَّقْتُهُ I gave him the سَبَق. (Az, Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
Thus it has two contr. significations. (IAar, Az,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, K.) Hence, in the trad. of Rukáneh the wrestler, مَا تُسَبِّقُنِى, i. e. What wilt<br>\
thou give me [if I overcome] ? and he said, The<br>\
third of my sheep, or goats. (Mgh.) And سَبَّقَ<br>\
البَدْرَةَ بَيْنَ الشُّعَرَآءِ (tropical:)  He made the [sum of money<br>\
termed] بدرة to be a سَبَق [i. e. stake, or wager,]<br>\
among the poets, to be taken by him who should<br>\
overcome. (Z, TA.) And it is said in a trad.,<br>\
أَمَرَ بِإِجْرَآءِ الخَيْلِ وَسبَّقَهَا ثَلَاثَةَ أَعْذُقٍ مِنْ ثَلَاثِ<br>\
نَخَلَاتٍ, meaning [He ordered the making of the<br>\
horse to run, and] gave them as a سَبَق [three<br>\
racemes of dates from three palm-trees]: or it<br>\
may mean, he took, or received, as their سَبَق:<br>\
or it [i. e. سبقها] may be without teshdeed, [as a<br>\
subst. with its affixed pronoun,] meaning the<br>\
property assigned [as their سَبَق]. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
One says also, سَبَّقْتُ بَيْنَ الخَيْلِ [app. meaning<br>\
I gave a سَبَق among the horses]: (O:) or سَبَّقْتُ<br>\
الخَيْلَ, and بَيْنَهَا ↓ سابقت, meaning I sent forth<br>\
the horses with their riders upon them, to see<br>\
which of them would outstrip. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
سبّقت الشَّاةُ, inf. n. as above, The ewe, or she-goat,<br>\
cast her young one, or fœtus, in an incomplete<br>\
state: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K:) but سبّغت, with غ,<br>\
is better known. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.)<br>\
-A2-  سَبَّقْتُ<br>\
الطَّائِرَ (tropical:)  I put the سِبَاقَانِ [or pair of jesses] upon<br>\
the legs of the bird, and [so] shackled it. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
سَابَقْتُهُ, inf. n. مُسَابَقَةٌ and سِبَاقٌ, [I strove, or<br>\
contended, with him to precede him; to be, or<br>\
become, get, go, or come, before him, or ahead of<br>\
him; to outgo, or outstrip, him; to have, get, or<br>\
take, precedence of him; in running (i. e. I<br>\
raced, or ran a race, with him); and in everything.] (Msb, TA.) You say, ↓ سَابَقْتُهُ فَسَبَقْتُهُ [I<br>\
strove, or contended, with him to precede him,<br>\
&amp;c., and I surpassed him, or overcame him, in<br>\
doing so]: (S:) the aor. of the latter verb in this<br>\
case is أَسْبُقُهُ, (Bd in xxi. 27,) and the inf. n. is<br>\
سَبْقٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 6. ―<br>\
-b3-  And see 2.<br>\
4<br>\
اسبق القَوْمُ إِلَى الأَمْرِ [perhaps a mistranscription for ↓ استبق] The people, or party,<br>\
hastened to the thing, or affair; or employed the<br>\
fulness of their power, or force, to hasten to it;<br>\
syn. بَادَرُوا. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تسابقا and ↓ استبقا signify the same: (K,<br>\
TA:) thus the saying [in the Kur xii. 25]<br>\
البَابَ ↓ وَاسْتَبَقَا means تَسَابَقَا إِلَيْهِ, i. e. And they<br>\
strove, or contended, each with the other, to precede, or get before, to the door. (TA.) [And<br>\
both are trans. by means of إِلَى:] you say,<br>\
تسابقوا إِلَى كَذَا and إِلَيْهِ ↓ استبقوا [They strove,<br>\
or contended, together, to precede, or be first, in<br>\
attaining to such a thing: and so ↓ سَابَقُوا: see<br>\
the Kur lvii. 21, here سَابِقُوا إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ is expl.<br>\
by Bd as meaning سَارِعُوا مُسَارَعَةَ المُسَابِقِينَ فِى<br>\
المِضْمَارِ i. e. Strive ye, one with another, in<br>\
hastening, with the striving of those that contend<br>\
to outstrip in the hippodrome, to obtain forgiveness]. (Msb.) And you say, فِى العَدْوِ ↓ اِسْتَبَقْنَا,<br>\
meaning تَسَابَقْنَا [i. e. We strove, or contended,<br>\
one with another, to precede, get before or ahead,<br>\
or outstrip, in running: and in like manner each<br>\
of these verbs is used in relation to any object of<br>\
contention for precedence]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تسابقوا<br>\
and ↓ استبقوا (tropical:)  They competed, or contended, together in shooting. (TA.) ↓ ذَهَبْنَا نَسْتَبِقُ, in the<br>\
Kur [xii. 17], means (assumed tropical:)  We went to compete, or<br>\
contend, together in shooting: (S, Bd:) or in<br>\
running. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And ↓ the latter of these verbs,<br>\
as well as the former, signifies also They laid bets,<br>\
wagers, or stakes, one with another. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِسْتَبَقَ [استبقهُ and استبق إِلَيْهِ i. q. بَادَرَ إِلَيْهِ. Thus]<br>\
فَاسْتَبِقُوا الخَيْرَاتِ, in the Kur [ii. 143 and v. 53],<br>\
means Therefore hasten ye to good acts, &amp;c.;<br>\
or employ the fulness of your power, or force, in<br>\
hastening thereto; syn. بَادِرُوا إِلَيْهَا. (O.) See also<br>\
4. ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also, استبق إِلَيْهِ الأَمْرُ, (K in art.<br>\
بدر,) or ↓ سَبَقَ, (M in that art.,) The thing, or<br>\
event, came to him, or happened to him, hastily,<br>\
quickly, or speedily; and beforehand [or before<br>\
he expected it]; syn. بَدَرَهُ, and بَدَرَ إِلَيْهِ. (M and<br>\
K in that art.) ―<br>\
-b3-  فَاسْتَبَقُوا الصِّرَاطَ, in the Kur<br>\
xxxvi. 66, in which الصراط is in the accus. case<br>\
because of إِلَى suppressed before it, or by making<br>\
الاِسْتِبَاقُ to imply the meaning of الاِبْتِدَارُ, (Bd,)<br>\
means And they would hasten, make haste, or<br>\
strive to get first or beforehand, to the road that<br>\
they were wont to travel: (Bd, Jel:) or (tropical:)  they<br>\
would go along the road and leave it behind<br>\
them, (Bd, * O, K, TA,) so that they would<br>\
wander from the right way. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\

(K:) pl. of the former أَسْبَاقٌ. (O, K.) It is said<br>\
in a trad., لَا سَبَقَ إِلَّا فِى خُفٍّ أَوْ حَافِرٍ أَوْ نَصْلٍ,<br>\

سَابِقٌ [act. part. n. of 1, Preceding, &amp;c.: and<br>\
sometimes it means one of the first or foremost:<br>\
as is shown by what here follows]: sometimes<br>\
what is thus termed has one coming up with it;<br>\
as [sometimes happens] in the case of the سابق of<br>\
horses: and sometimes it is like him who obtains<br>\
the winning-cane (قَصَبَة السَّبْق [see art. قصب]);<br>\

him in it, there being none coming up with him.<br>\
(Msb.) It is applied to a horse That outstrips;<br>\
