and was, or became, quiet, still, or motionless:<br>\

was, or became, motionless: (S, TA:) Az says<br>\
that سَبَتَ in the first of these senses is not known<br>\
in the language of the Arabs: (TA:) [but J says<br>\
that] the primary signification of سُبَاتٌ is “ rest: ”<br>\
and hence the former of these verbs signifies he slept.<br>\

سَبْت [or sabbath]: (S, M:) or they (the Jews)<br>\
ceased from seeking the means of subsistence, and<br>\
the labouring to acquire gain. (Msb.) It is said<br>\
in the Kur [vii. 163], وَيَوْمَ لَا يَسْبِتُونَ And on the<br>\
day when they were not keeping the ordinances<br>\
of their سَبْت: (S:) where some read ↓ لا يُسْبِتُونَ,<br>\
from أَسْبَتَ; and some, ↓ لا يُسْبَتُونَ, in the pass.<br>\
form, meaning when they were not made to enter<br>\
upon [the observance of] the سَبْت. (Bd.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
سَبَتَتْ, aor.<br>\
سَبِتَ, inf. n. سَبْتٌ, She (a camel) went<br>\

is shown in the TA]; (M, A, Mgh, K, TA;) as<br>\
also ↓ سبّتهُ: expl. by Lh as relating particularly<br>\
to necks. (M, TA.) [Hence,] سَبَتَ عِلَاوَتَهُ, (S, M,)<br>\

decapitate him]: (S, M, K:) and سُبِتَتْ عِلَاوَتُهُ,<br>\

the present day.]<br>\

7<br>\
انسبت [It became cut off, interrupted, put<br>\
a stop to, or put an end to, or it ceased: meanings<br>\
indicated in this art. in the M and TA. ―<br>\
-b2- ] It<br>\
became extended: (K:) or long and extended,<br>\
together with softness. (TA.) It is said in a<br>\
description of the countenance of the Prophet,<br>\
(TA,) كَانَ فِى وَجْهِهِ انْسِبَاتٌ There was, in his<br>\
face, length, and extension. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It (a<br>\
hide) became soft by the process of tanning.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  انسبتت الرُّطَبَةُ The date became<br>\
wholly pervaded by ripeness: (M, TA:) and became soft. (TA.) And انسبت الرُّطَبُ The dates<br>\
became all ripe, or ripe throughout. (M, TA.)<br>\
سَبْتٌ Rest: (S, K:) and quiet, stillness, or<br>\

-b2-  السَّبْتُ, (M, K,)<br>\
or يَوْمُ السَّبْتِ, (S, Msb,) [The sabbath, or Saturday;] one of the days of the week; (M, K;) the<br>\
seventh of those days: (M:) so called because<br>\
the creation commenced on the first day of the<br>\
week and continued to [the end of] Friday, and<br>\
on the سبت there was no creation, the work<br>\
having ceased thereon: or, as some say, because<br>\
the Jews ceased thereon from work, and the<br>\
management of affairs: (M, TA:) or because the<br>\
days [of the week] end thereon: (S, TA:) Az<br>\
says that he errs who asserts it to have been so<br>\
called because God commanded the Children of<br>\
Israel to rest thereon, and that God created the<br>\
heavens and the earth in six days, whereof the<br>\
last was Friday, then rested, and the work ceased,<br>\
and therefore He named the seventh day يوم<br>\
السبت: this, he says, is an error, because [he<br>\
affirms that] سَبَتَ as meaning “ he rested ” is not<br>\
known in the language of the Arabs, but signifies<br>\
قَطَعَ; and rest cannot be attributed to God,<br>\
because He knows not fatigue, and rest is only<br>\
after fatigue and work: (TA:) the pl. [of pauc.]<br>\
is أَسْبُتٌ and [of mult.] سُبُوتٌ: (S, M, Msb, K:)<br>\
it has no dim. (Sb, S in art. امس.) ―<br>\
-b3-  سَبْتٌ also<br>\
means A week; from the سَبْت to the سَبْت [i. e.<br>\
from the sabbath to the sabbath]: so in the saying, in a trad., فَمَا رَأَيْنَا الشَّمْسَ سَبْتًا [And we saw<br>\
not the sun for a week]: as when one says<br>\
“ twenty autumns ” meaning “ twenty years: ” or<br>\
it means in this instance a space of time, whether<br>\
short or long. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  I. q. بُرْهَةٌ [i. e. A space,<br>\
or period, or a long space or period,] (M, K, TA)<br>\
مِنَ الدَّهْرِ [of time]: (TA:) so in the saying,<br>\
أَقَمْتُ سَبْتًا [I remained, staid, dwelt, or abode, a<br>\
space, or a long space, of time]; as also ↓ سَبْتَةً<br>\
and ↓ سَنْبَتًا and ↓ سَنْبَتَتًا. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And i. q. دَهْرٌ<br>\
[meaning Time; or a long time; or a space, or<br>\
period, of time, whether long or short; &amp;c.]; as<br>\
also ↓ سُبَاتٌ. (S, M, K.) And [hence] ↓ اِبْنَا سُبَاتٍ<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  The night and the day: (S, M, K:) Ibn<br>\
Ahmar says,<br>\
وَكُنَّا وَهُمْ كَابْنَىْ سُبَاتٍ تَفَرَّقَا<br>\
سِوًى ثُمَّ كَانَا مُنْجِدًا وَتَهَامِيَا<br>\
[And we were, with them, like the night and the<br>\
day that parted asunder alike, then became one<br>\
going towards Nejd and one going towards<br>\
Tihámeh]: (S, K:) such, they say, is the meaning: (S:) or, as IB says, on the authority of<br>\
Aboo-Jaafar Mohammad Ibn-Habeeb, ابنا سبات<br>\
were two men, one of whom saw the other in a<br>\
dream, and then one of them awoke in Nejd, and<br>\
the other in Tihámeh: or they were two brothers,<br>\
one of whom went to the east to see where the<br>\
sun rose, and the other to the west to see where<br>\
it set. (L, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain pace (S, M,<br>\
K) of camels: (S, K:) or a quick pace: (TA:)<br>\
or i. q. عَنَقٌ [q. v.]: (AA, S:) or a pace exceeding<br>\
that termed العَنَقُ. (M.)<br>\
-A3-  A swift, or an excellent, horse; (K, TA;) that runs much. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  A boy, or young man, of bad disposition, or<br>\
illnatured, and bold, or daring. (K) ―<br>\
-b3-  A man<br>\
cunning, i. e. possessing intelligence, or sagacity,<br>\
or intelligence mixed with craft and forecast;<br>\
and excellent in judgment; or very cunning &amp;c.;<br>\
(K, TA;) silent, or lowering his eyes, looking<br>\
towards the ground; (TA;) and ↓ سُبَاتٌ signifies<br>\
the same. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  A man who sleeps much;<br>\
(K;) i. e. كَثِيرُ السُّبَاتِ. (TA.) See also مَسْبُوتٌ.<br>\
-A4-  See also what next follows.<br>\
سُبْتٌ A certain plant, resembling the خِطْمِىّ<br>\
[or marsh-mallow]; (Kr, M, K;) as also ↓ سَبْتٌ,<br>\
(K [there expressly said to be with fet-h],) or<br>\
↓ سِبْتٌ: (M [so written in a copy of that work]:)<br>\
said to be a certain plant used for tanning.<br>\
(MF.) See the next paragraph.<br>\
سِبْتٌ The hides, or skins, of oxen; (M, K;)<br>\
whether tanned or not tanned: so some say:<br>\
(M:) or (so accord. to the M, in the K and TA<br>\
“ and,” but the و is omitted in the CK,) any<br>\
tanned hide; (As, AA, M, K;) said to be so<br>\
called [because the tanning removes the hair,]<br>\
from السَّبْتُ, “the act of shaving: ” (AA, TA:)<br>\
or such. as is tanned with قَرَظ [q. v.]: (M, K:)<br>\
or only ox-hides tanned: so says AHn on the<br>\
authority of As and AZ: (TA:) or ox-hides<br>\
tanned with قَرَظ, (S, Mgh,) whereof are made<br>\
[the sandals called] ↓ نِعَالٌ سِبْتيَّةٌ: (S) these are<br>\
hence thus called: (Mgh:) they are sandals<br>\
having no hair upon them: (M, Msb:) or sandals<br>\
tanned with قرَظ: (AA, TA:) accord. to Az, they<br>\
are thus called because their hair has been shaven<br>\
off (سُبِتَ, i. e. حُلِقَ,) and removed by a wellknown process in tanning, (Mgh, * TA,) so that<br>\
they are soft; and they are of the sandals of<br>\
people that lead a life of ease and softness:<br>\
(Mgh:) IAar says that they are thus called<br>\
because of their having become soft by the<br>\
tanning: accord. to this, they should be called<br>\
↓ سَبْتِيَّة; and so accord. to a saying of EdDáwoodee, that they are called in relation to<br>\
سُوقُ السَّبْتِ [“ the Market of the Sabbath ”]:<br>\
it is also said that they are called in relation to<br>\
the ↓ سُبْت, with damm, which is a plant used for<br>\
tanning therewith; so that they should be called<br>\
↓ سُبْتِيَّة, unless the appellation be an instance of a<br>\
rel. n. deviating from its source of derivation [or<br>\
unless this plant be also termed سِبْتٌ, as it is<br>\
accord. to a copy of the M]: (TA:) see سُبْتٌ.<br>\
It is related of the Prophet, that he saw a man<br>\
walking among the graves wearing his sandals,<br>\
and said, يَا صَاحِبَ السِّبْتَينِ اِخْلَعْ سِبْتَيْكَ [meaning (tropical:)  O wearer of the pair of sandals of سِبْت,<br>\
pull off thy pair of sandals of سِبْت]: (S, * TA:)<br>\
and accord. to the A, they are thus termed<br>\
tropically: it is like the saying “ Such a one<br>\
wears wool, and cotton, and silk; ” meaning<br>\
“ garments made thereof; ” as is said in the<br>\
Nh: but, as some relate it, what he said was,<br>\
↓ يَا صَاحِبَ السِّبْتِيَّيْنِ, the last of these words<br>\
being a rel. n.; and thus it is found in the handwriting of Az, in his book. (TA.)<br>\
سِبِتٌّ, (M, L, K,) like فِلِزٌّ, (TA,) [in a copy<br>\
of the M erroneously written سِبْت,] A certain<br>\
plant; [anethum graveolens, or dill, of the common garden-species;] an arabicized word, from<br>\
[the Pers.] شِبِتّ [or شِبِتْ]: (AHn, M, L:) or<br>\
i. q. شِبِتٌّ; both words arabicized from شِوِذْ [or<br>\
شِوِدْ]: (K:) asserted by some to be the same as<br>\
سَنُّوتٌ [q. v.]: (M, L:) Az says that شِبِتٌّ, the<br>\
name of a well-known herb, or leguminous plant,<br>\
is an arabicized word; that he had heard the<br>\
people of El-Bahreyn call it سِبِتٌّ, with the<br>\
unpointed س, and with ت; that it is originally,<br>\
in Pers., شِوِذْ; and that it has another dial. var.,<br>\
namely, سبط [i. e. سِبِطٌّ]. (El-Jawáleekee, TA.)<br>\
سَبْتَةٌ: see سَبْتٌ, in the middle of the paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  Also Goats, collectively. (K.)<br>\
سَبْتَآءُ A [desert such as is termed] صَحْرَآء:<br>\
(AZ, K:) or أَرْضٌ سَبْتَآءُ is like صَحْرَآءُ: or a land<br>\
in which are no trees: (M:) and i. q. ↓ مَسْبُوتَةٌ<br>\
[i. e. a bare land; as though shorn of its herbage]: (TA:) pl. سَبَاتِىُّ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, [in like<br>\
manner] a fem. epithet, Having spreading, or<br>\
expanded, ears, whether long or short. (K.)<br>\
سَبْتِىٌّ One who fasts alone on the سَبْت [i. e.<br>\
sabbath, or Saturday]: thus in the saying mentioned by Th, on the authority of IAar, لَا تَكُ<br>\
سَبْتِيًّا [Be not thou one who fasts &amp;c.]. (M.)<br>\
نِعَالٌ سِبْتِيَّةٌ, and سَبْتِيَّةٌ, and سُبْتِيَّةٌ; and the dual.<br>\
of سِبْتِىٌّ, applied to a pair of sandals: see سِبْتٌ,<br>\
in four places.<br>\
سِبْتَانٌ, with kesr, Foolish, stupid, or of little<br>\
sense; (K, TA;) confounded, or perplexed, and<br>\
unable to see his right course; without understanding. (TA.)<br>\
سُبَاتٌ primarily signifies Rest [like سَبْتٌ]:<br>\
(S, Msb:) and hence, sleep: (S, K:) or heavy<br>\
sleep: (Msb:) or sleep that is hardly perceptible<br>\
(خَفِىّ, M, K, [in some copies of the K, as mentioned by Freytag, خَفِيف, i. e. light,]), like a<br>\
swoon: (M:) or the commencement of sleep in<br>\
the head [and its continuance] until it reaches<br>\
the heart: (Th, M, K:) or the sleep of one who<br>\
is sick; i. e. light sleep: (TA:) and ↓ سَبْتٌ signifies the same as سُبَاتٌ. (T, TA.) Hence, in<br>\
the Kur [lxxviii. 9, and in like manner the word<br>\
is used in xxv. 49], وَجَعَلْنَا نَوْمَكُمْ سُبَاتًا; (S;) i. e.<br>\
قَطْعًا; as though a man, when he slept, were cut<br>\
off from [the rest of] mankind: (IAar, TA:) or<br>\
سبات is when one is cut off, or ceases, from<br>\
motion, while the soul still remains in the body;<br>\
i. e., the text means, And we have made your<br>\
sleep to be rest unto you: (Zj, TA:) or we have<br>\
made your sleep to be a cutting off from sensation<br>\
and motion, for rest to the animal forces, and<br>\
for causing their weariness to cease: or, to be<br>\
death: (Bd:) or, to be rest unto your bodies by<br>\
the interruption of labour, or work. (Jel.)<br>\

سَبَنْتًى, (S, M, K,) as also سَبَنْدًى, (S,) Bold,<br>\
or daring; (S, M, K;) as an epithet applied to<br>\
anything [i. e. man or brute]: the ى is added to<br>\
render it quasi-coordinate to the class of quinqueliteral-radical words, not to denote the fem.<br>\
gender, for it receives ة as a termination [to<br>\
denote the fem.], becoming سَبَنْتَاةٌ; (S;) and has<br>\
tenween. (TA.) A poet applies the fem. epithet<br>\
to a she-camel. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The leopard; (S,<br>\
M, K;) so too with ة; (AHeyth, L in art. سبد;)<br>\
and so سَبَنْدًى: probably thus called because of<br>\
his boldness, or daringness: (S:) or, as some<br>\
ay, the lion: fem. with ة: or the fem, signifies a<br>\
bold, or daring, lioness: or a she-camel of bold,<br>\
or daring, breast; but this last is not of valid<br>\
authority: (M:) and a beast of prey [absolutely]:<br>\
(L in art. سيد:) pl. سَبَانِتُ; (K, TA;) and some<br>\
of the Arabs make سَبَاتِى [or rather سَبَاتٍ] to be<br>\
its pl. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The fem. also, applied to a<br>\
woman, signifies Sharp in tongue; or clamorous;<br>\
or clamorous and foul-tongued; or long-tongued<br>\
and vehemently clamorous. (TA.)<br>\

[or sabbath]. (TA.)<br>\
مَسْبُوتٌ Affected with [the kind, or degree, or<br>\
semblance, of sleep termed] سُبَات [q. v.]: (IAar,<br>\
M:) or affected with a swoon: and, applied to a<br>\
sick man, prostrated like him who is sleeping,<br>\
generally closing his eyes: (S:) or confounded,<br>\
or perplexed, and unable to see his right course:<br>\
(Msb:) and ↓ سَبْتٌ signifies the same as مَسْبُوتٌ;<br>\
as in the saying, cited by As,<br>\
يُصْبِحُ مَخْمُورًا وَيُمْسِى سَبْتَا<br>\
[He is in the morning affected with the remains<br>\
