Lth, (T, TA,) سِوَاكٌ is masc. and fem., (IDrd, T,<br>\
M, O, K,) though it is the more approvable way<br>\
to make it masc.; (O;) but Az holds this to be<br>\
a mistake, and the word to be masc. [only]; and<br>\
Hr says that this assertion of Lth is one of his<br>\
foul mistakes: (TA:) its pl. is سُوُكٌ (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K) and سُوْكٌ (Az, TA) and سُؤُكٌ, (AHn, TA,)<br>\

مَسَاوِيكُ. (TA.) In the saying, in a trad., خَيْرُ<br>\
خِلَالِ الصَّائِمِ السِّوَاكُ, a prefixed n. is [said to be]<br>\
suppressed [so that the meaning is The best of the<br>\
habits, or customs, of the faster is the use of the<br>\
tooth-stick: but see 2, where سِوَاكٌ is said, on the<br>\
authority of the Msb, to be also an inf. n.].<br>\
