skin: also he rubbed it, namely, a thing, with<br>\
another thing, so as to abrade, or remove, its<br>\
superficial part: and it, namely, a thing, hitting<br>\
another thing, abraded from it a little of its<br>\
superficial part; as when a thing hits the solid<br>\
hoof previously to [that state of attenuation and<br>\
abrasion which is termed] الوَجَى. (TA.) You<br>\
say, سَحَجْتُ جِلْدَهُ I abraded, or removed, the<br>\
outer integument [i. e. the cuticle] of his skin.<br>\
(S.) And أَصَابَهُ شَىْءٌ فَسَحَجَ وَجْهَهُ [A thing hit<br>\
him, and abraded the cuticle of his face]. (S.)<br>\
And سَحَجَ العُودَ بِالمِبْرَدِ He abraded the outer<br>\
part of the wood, or piece of wood, or stick, with<br>\
the file. (TA.) And يَسْحَجُ الأَرْضَ بِخُفِّهِ, referring to a camel, (S, K, TA,) He pares the surface of the ground with his foot, so that he is not<br>\
slow in becoming attenuated and abraded in the sole.<br>\
(TA.) And سَحَجَتِ الرِّيَاحُ الأَرْضَ [The winds<br>\
pared the surface of the earth, removing the dust<br>\
and pebbles: like سَهَجَت]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He bit<br>\
him so as to make a mark, or marks, upon him;<br>\
[or so as to lacerate his skin;] used especially in<br>\
relation to wild asses; and so ↓ سحّجهُ, [but in<br>\
an intensive sense, i. e. he so bit him much, or<br>\
many times, (see مُسَحَّجٌ,)] inf. n. تَسْحِيجٌ and<br>\

-b3-  also signifies The combing<br>\
gently upon the skin of the head: (K, TA:)<br>\
[combing the hair with a gentle pressure upon<br>\
the skin of the head:] one says, سَحَجَ شَعَرَهُ بِالمُشْطِ,<br>\
inf. n. سَحْجٌ, He combed his hair [pressing the<br>\
comb] gently [upon the skin of his head]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And The going quickly [as though paring the<br>\
surface of the earth with the feet, or making<br>\
marks upon it]. (O, K.) You say, مَرَّ يَسْحَجُ<br>\
He passed along going quickly: and [so] يَسْحَجُ<br>\
السَّيْرَ. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And A running of beasts<br>\
falling short of such as is vehement. (K.) ―<br>\

above, (K, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He made the oaths to follow<br>\
one another with little, or no, interruption. (K, *<br>\

2<br>\
سحّجهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَسْحِيجٌ and مُسَحَّجٌ,<br>\
[of which latter, see an ex. in what follows,]<br>\
(TA,) He abraded, or otherwise removed, its<br>\
outer integument, or superficial part, much, or<br>\
often. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1. An ex. of the latter<br>\
inf. n. occurs in the following hemistich of the<br>\
“ Jeemeeyeh ” of El-&#39;Ajjáj:<br>\
جَأْبَا تَرَى بِلِيِتِهِ مُسَحَّجَا<br>\
[A bulky, or strong, wild ass, in the side of whose<br>\
neck thou seest much biting, or lacerating of the<br>\
skin, that has made marks upon it]: thus heard<br>\
by AHát from the mouth of AZ, and thus recited<br>\
by the former to As, who disallowed it, and said,<br>\
تَلِيلَهُ [i. e. whose neck, or cheek, thou seest to be<br>\
much bitten, &amp;c., instead of بِلِيِتِهِ], but abstained<br>\
from objecting after AHát had adduced other exs.<br>\
[of similar inf. ns.], and among them the saying<br>\
in the Kur [xxxiv. 18], وَ مَزَّقْنَاهُمْ كُلَّ مُمَزَّقٍ: Az<br>\
says that مسحّجا is here made an inf. n., like<br>\
تَسْحِيجًا. (TA)<br>\
5<br>\
تسحّج It had its outer integument, or<br>\
superficial part, abraded, or otherwise removed,<br>\
much, or often: (S, K:) said of the skin<br>\
[&amp;c.]. (S.)<br>\
7<br>\
انسحج It had its outer integument, or<br>\
superficial part, abraded, or otherwise removed:<br>\
(S, K:) said of the skin: (S:) [and it seems from<br>\
the phrase سَحَجُ الفَخِذَيْنِ occurring in the O<br>\
and K in art. بذح, that ↓ سَحِجَ, inf. n. سَحَجٌ,<br>\
may signify the same: but سَحَجُ may there be a<br>\
mistranscription for سَحْجُ.] One says, اِنْسَحَجَ<br>\
جِلْدُهُ مِنْ شَىْءٍ مَرَّ بِهِ His skin had its cuticle<br>\
abraded in consequence of a thing that passed by<br>\
him. (TA.)<br>\
سَحْجٌ inf. n. of سَحَجَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,<br>\
Dysentery, or the like; because attended by<br>\
abrasion, or excoriation, of the colon;] a certain<br>\
disease of the bowels; (PS;) an abrading disease<br>\
in the belly. (TA.) You say, بِهِ سَحْجٌ (S) i. e.<br>\
In him is the disease above mentioned. (PS.)<br>\
سَحُوجٌ: see سَحَّاجٌ.<br>\
سَحِيجٌ Having its outer integument, or superficial part, abraded, or otherwise removed; as<br>\
also ↓ مَسْحُوجٌ. (TA.)<br>\
سَحَّاجٌ A camel that pares the surface of the<br>\
ground with his foot, (S, * K, * TA,) so that he<br>\
is not slow in becoming attenuated and abraded<br>\
in the sole. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A man who makes<br>\
oaths to follow one another with little, or no,<br>\
interruption: (TA:) and so ↓ مِسْحَاجٌ and ↓ سَحُوجٌ<br>\
applied to a woman. (K, * TA.) And حَلِفٌ سَحَّاجٌ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A swearing in which the oaths are made so to<br>\
follow one another. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
سَاحِجٌ act. part. n. of سَحَجَ: fem. with ة: pl.<br>\
of the fem. سَوَاحِجُ. Hence,] رِيَاحٌ سَوَاحِجُ<br>\
[Winds paring, or that pare, the surface of the<br>\
earth, removing the dust and pebbles]. (A, TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
مَسْحَجٌ A place of abrasion, &amp;c.: pl. مَسَاحِجُ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,] one says, of an ass, (A,) i. e. a wild<br>\
ass, (TA,) عَلَيْهِ المَسَاحِجُ Upon him are the<br>\
marks, or scars, of the biting of other asses. (A,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
مِسْحَجٌ The [instrument called] مِبْرَاة with<br>\
which one pares, or shapes, wood. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[And hence, app., A rain that is as though it<br>\
pared the surface of the earth. Accord. to Freytag, مَسْحَجٌ occurs in this sense in the Deewán<br>\
of Jereer: pl. مَسَاحِجُ: but the correct word is<br>\
evidently مِسْحَجٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, and ↓ مِسْحَاجٌ, (O,<br>\
K, TA,) A wild ass that bites [other asses] much,<br>\
or frequently: (TA:) [or each signifies, though<br>\
not so expl. in the TA,] an ass [i. e. a wild ass]<br>\
that runs a pace falling short of such as is vehement. (O. K.)<br>\
مُسَحَّجٌ An ass [i. e. a wild ass] much bitten.<br>\
