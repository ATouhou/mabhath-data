سَارَ, aor. يَسِيرُ, inf. n. سَيْرٌ and مَسِيرٌ, (S, M,<br>\
A, Mgh, Msb, K,) which latter is extr., for by<br>\

[to the ع], (S,) and مَسِيرَةٌ (M, K) and سَيْرُورَةٌ<br>\
(M, Mgh, K) like قَيْلُولَةٌ, but [Mtr says] we have<br>\
not heard it, (Mgh,) and تَسْيَارٌ, (S, M, K,) which<br>\
last denotes repetition or frequency of the action,<br>\
(M,) He, or it, went [in any manner, or any<br>\
pace]; went, or passed, along; marched, journeyed, or proceeded; went away, passed away, or<br>\
departed; (M, * K, * TA;) by night and by day.<br>\
(Msb, TA.) You say, سَارَتِ الدَّابَّةُ [The beast<br>\
went, went along, &amp;c.]. (S.) [And سار سَيْرًا شَدِيدًا<br>\
He (a camel or other beast, and a man,) went a<br>\
vehement pace, or vehemently. And سار العَنَقَ<br>\
He (a camel, or a horse,) went the pace, or in the<br>\
manner, termed العَنَق: and the like.] And سَارُوا<br>\
مِنْ بَلَدٍ لِبَلَدٍ [They went, or journeyed, from<br>\
town to town, or from country to country]: (A:)<br>\
or سار مِنْ بَلَدٍ إِلَى بَلَدٍ [he went, &amp;c.]. (Mgh.)<br>\

from thy place; pass thou from it: (L in art.<br>\
نفذ:) or (assumed tropical:)  feign thou heedlessness, and bear, or<br>\
endure, or be forbearing; an elliptical phrase;<br>\
as though it were originally سِرْ وَدَعْ عَنْكَ المِرَآءَ<br>\
وَالشَّكَّ [go thou, and leave wrangling and doubt].<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, سارت السَّفِينَةُ (tropical:)  The ship went, or<br>\
sailed: for] سَيْرُ السَّفِينَةِ is a tropical phrase.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And سار سِيرَةً حَسَنَةً (tropical:)  [He pursued a<br>\

سُنَّةً (assumed tropical:)  He made, or caused, a way, course, mode,<br>\

says,<br>\
فَلَا تَجْزَعَنْ مِنْ سُنَّةٍ أَنْتَ سِرْتَهَا<br>\
فَأَوَّلُ رَاضٍ سُنَّةً مَنْ يَسِيرُهَا<br>\
[Then by no means be thou impatient of a way<br>\
of acting which thou hast made usual; for the<br>\
first who should be content with a way of acting<br>\
is he who makes it usual]. (S, M, L, TA: but<br>\
in the M and TA, in the place of تجزعن, we find<br>\

سِيَرَآءُ (S, M, K, &amp;c.) and سِيْرَآء (TA) [which<br>\

a contraction of the former,] A sort of garment,<br>\

who says so cites Sb as asserting that a word of<br>\
the measure فِعَلَآءُ is not an epithet, but is a subst.:<br>\
hence, he says, it is used with a prefixed noun, as<br>\
in the ex. حُلَّةُ سِيَرَآءَ; and is expl. as signifying clear silk. (IAth, TA.) ―<br>\

مَسُورٌ فِيهِ, (IJ, M,) [A travelled road,] and رَجُلٌ<br>\
مَسُورٌ بِهِ [A man made to go, or journey, &amp;c.]:<br>\
(IJ, M, K:) accord. to Kh, in this case, and in<br>\
others like it, the ى is changed into و [so that<br>\
مَسْيُورٌ, the original form of مَسِيرٌ and of مَسُورٌ,<br>\
becomes مَسْوُورٌ, and is then contracted into مَسُورٌ]:<br>\
(M:) or, accord. to Kh, the ى is rejected: but<br>\
accord. to Akh, it is the و that is rejected [so<br>\
that مَسْيُورٌ becomes مَسْيُرٌ; and then, مَسُيْرٌ; and<br>\
then مَسُورٌ]. (TA.)<br>\

other provision, for subsistence, to be laid up in<br>\
