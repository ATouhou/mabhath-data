↓ سُلْوَانًا Thou hast made me content, or happy, [or<br>\
hast infused into me content, or happiness,] without thee [or in thine absence]. (As, S.) And<br>\
هُوَ فِى سَلْوَةٍ مِنَ العَيْشِ He is in a state of life<br>\

[in the present day applied to the quail,] i. q.<br>\
سُمَانَى [which is also applied in the present day<br>\
to the quail], (Ksh and Bd and Jel in ii. 54,)<br>\
[or] white [?], resembling the سُمَانَى, (M,) or like<br>\
the pigeon, but longer in the shank and neck than<br>\
the latter, and of a colour resembling that of the<br>\
سُمَانَى, quick in motion: accord. to Akh, the<br>\
word is used as sing. and pl.: (Msb:) [or] Akh<br>\
says, I have not heard any sing. thereof, and it<br>\
seems that the single one is thus called like the pl.<br>\
number, in like manner as دفْلَى is [said to be]<br>\
applied to one and to the pl. number: (S:) or<br>\
the n. un. is سَلْوَاةٌ; (M, K;) of which Lth cites<br>\
as an ex. this saying, [in which بَلَّلَهُ should be<br>\
بَلَّلَهَا,]<br>\
كَمَا انْتَفَضَ السَّلْوَاةُ بَلَّلَهُ القَطْرُ<br>\

much wetted]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Honey; (S, M,<br>\
K;) and so ↓ سُلْوَانَةٌ, with damm: (K:) the<br>\
former is used in this sense by a poet, (S, M,)<br>\
namely, Khálid Ibn-Zuheyr; and Zj says that<br>\
Khálid has made a mistake, the word سلوى signifying only a certain bird; but, accord. to AAF,<br>\
(M,) ―<br>\
-b2-  السَّلْوَى signifies [also] Whatever renders<br>\
thee forgetful, or content, or happy, in a case of<br>\
privation; (كُلُّ مَا سَلَّاكَ, M, K;) and honey<br>\
is thus called because it renders thee thus by its<br>\
sweetness. (M.)<br>\
سُلْوَانٌ A water which is drunk and which<br>\
renders one forgetful, or content, or happy, in a<br>\
case of privation; or comforts, or consoles, for a<br>\
loss or want: (Lh, M, K:) or a thing that is<br>\
given to drink to the passionate lover in order<br>\
that he may be forgetful, or content, or happy,<br>\
without the woman: (Lh, M:) or it consists in<br>\
one&#39;s taking some of the dust, or earth, of a grave,<br>\
and sprinkling it upon water, and giving it to<br>\
drink to the passionate lover, (M, K, *) whereupon<br>\
his love dies: (K:) or rain-water poured upon a<br>\
certain bead (خَرَزَةٌ) called ↓ سُلْوَانَةٌ, of which they<br>\
used to say that when the passionate lover drank<br>\
this water he became forgetful, or content, or<br>\
happy, in his privation: (S:) or a certain medicine which is given to drink to him who is in<br>\
grief and in consequence of which he becomes<br>\
happy; (S, K;) called by the physicians مُفَرِّحٌ:<br>\
(S:) or a certain bead (خَرَزَةٌ) for captivating, or<br>\
fascinating, also called ↓ سُلْوَانَةٌ, (Lh, M, K,)<br>\
and ↓ سَلْوَانَةٌ, (Sgh, K,) with which women captivate, or fascinate, men, restraining them from<br>\
other women: (Lh, M:) or ↓ سُلْوَانَةٌ signifies [or,<br>\
accord. to the K, signifies also] a certain bead<br>\
(خَرَزَةٌ, M, K,) transparent, (M,) which, when<br>\
one has buried it in the sand and then scraped the<br>\
sand up from over it, is seen to be black, and is<br>\
given [in water] to drink to a man, and renders<br>\
him forgetful, or content, or happy, in a case of<br>\
privation: (M, K: *) or a pebble upon which<br>\
water is poured and given to drink to a man, who<br>\
thereupon becomes forgetful, or content, or happy,<br>\
in a case of privation: (M:) Ru-beh says,<br>\
لَوْ أَشْرَبُ السُّلْوَانَ مَا سَلِيتُ<br>\
مَابِى غِنًى عَنْكِ وَإِنْ غَنِيتُ<br>\
(S, M, *) and Nuseyr Ibn-Abee-Nuseyr, in answer<br>\
to a question of As respecting the meaning of<br>\
السلوان, said that it is a bead (خَرَزَةٌ) which is<br>\
bruised, or pulverized, [and upon which water is<br>\
then poured,] the water of which occasions in the<br>\
drinker thereof forgetfulness, or content, or happiness, in a case of privation: but As disallowed<br>\
this, and said that it is an inf. n. of سَلَوْتُ, and<br>\
that the meaning is لَوْ أَشْرَبُ السُّلُوَّ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Were I<br>\
made to drink forgetfulness, &amp;c., I should not<br>\
become forgetful, &amp;c.: there is not in me freedom<br>\
from want of thee, though I be free from want of<br>\
others]. (TA.) See also سَلْوَةٌ.<br>\

imperfectly decl.,] A quality that renders forgetful of the objects of love or affection, or that<br>\
renders content, or happy, without them. (TA<br>\
in art. سلى.)<br>\

Having his heart free from love, or affection.<br>\
(Har p. 41.)<br>\
مُسْلَاةٌ [a noun of the class of مُبْخَلَةٌ and مَجْبَنَةٌ<br>\
&amp;c., originally مَسْلَوَةٌ]. One says, فِيهِ مَسْلَاةٌ عَنِ<br>\
الكُرَبِ [In him is a cause of forgetfulness of, or<br>\
freedom from, anxieties]: like مُعْلَاةٌ [in form].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
المُسَلِّى The third [in arriving at the goal] of<br>\
the ten horses that are started together for a race:<br>\
so called because he renders his owner content, or<br>\
happy (يُسَلِّيهِ). (Ham p. 46.)<br>\
مُتَسَلًّى [a noun of place from 5]. One says,<br>\
مَاعَنْهُ مُتَسَلًّى [There is not any place in which<br>\
one may be rendered forgetful, &amp;c., of him, or it;<br>\
or in which one may be rendered content, or<br>\
happy, without him, or it]. (TA.)<br>\
