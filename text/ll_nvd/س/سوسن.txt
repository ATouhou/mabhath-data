(Msb, K,) by the vulgar pronounced سُوسَنٌ, with<br>\
damm to the first letter, (Msb, [and thus written<br>\
in one of my copies of the S, in the other of those<br>\
copies, and app. in most others, omitted,]) a<br>\
Pers., or foreign, word, (أَعْجَمِىٌّ,) current in the<br>\
language of the Arabs, (M,) [i. e.] an arabicized<br>\
word, [app. from the Pers. سُوسَنْ, in Hebr.<br>\
שׁוּשַׁן,] (S,) [applied in the present day to The<br>\
lily: and also the iris: and the pancratium:<br>\
and app. to other similar flowers:] a certain<br>\
plant, (M, Msb, K, *) of sweet odour, (K,) resembling what are called رَيَاحِين, with broad<br>\
leaves, but not having an odour that diffuses<br>\
itself like the رياحين; (Msb;) it is well known,<br>\
and of many kinds, the sweetest of which is the<br>\
white: (S: [but only, as mentioned above, in one<br>\
of my two copies thereof:]) there is a wild kind;<br>\
and the garden-kind is of two sorts, namely, the<br>\
آزَاد, which is the white, and the إِيرِسَآء, [i. e. the<br>\
iris, in the CK, erroneously, اَبْرَسا,] which is the<br>\
آسْمَانْجُونِىّ, [i. e. azure-coloured, from the Pers.<br>\
آسْمَانْ گُونْ,] beneficial as a remedy against the<br>\
dropsy, an attenuant of thick matters; and the<br>\
آزَاد is of a delicate, or subtile, nature, [so I here<br>\
render لَطِيفٌ, but it has other meanings,] beneficial as a remedy for cold disorders in the<br>\
brain, a discutient of the thick kinds of flatus<br>\
that collect therein; its أَصْل [app. here meaning<br>\
root] is a detergent of the skin, discutient; and<br>\
its leaves are beneficial as a remedy against the<br>\
burning of hot water, and against the sting of<br>\
venomous reptiles or the like, and particularly of<br>\
the scorpion: the n. un. is with ة. (K.)<br>\
