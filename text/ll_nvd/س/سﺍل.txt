سَأَلَهُ (S, M, K) with كَذَا following it, and<br>\
سَأَلَهُ عَنْ كَذَا and بِكَذَا, (S, * K,) aor. يَسْأَلُ, (M,)<br>\
inf. n. سُؤَالٌ and مَسْأَلَةٌ, (S, M, K,) which latter is<br>\
also pronounced مَسَلَةٌ, without the hemzeh, (TA,)<br>\
and تَسْآلٌ and سَآلَةٌ, (M, K,) and سَأَلَةٌ or سَأْلَةٌ,<br>\
(accord. to different copies of the K, the former<br>\
of these two accord. to the TA, [and it appears<br>\
from a statement that will be found below, voce<br>\
سُؤْلٌ, that one of these is correct, but in an excel-lent copy of the M, in the place thereof, I find,<br>\
and ↓ سَآءَلَهُ, as a verb, doubly trans., first thus by<br>\
itself, and secondly by means of عَنْ, as shown by<br>\
an ex. in a verse cited below, (see 3,) and this<br>\
also is correct,]) all [sometimes] signify the same,<br>\
(S, * K,) i. e. He asked him such a thing; or<br>\
asked him, interrogated him, questioned him, or<br>\
inquired of him, respecting such a thing: but<br>\
عن كذا is more common than بكذا: when سَأَلَ<br>\
means the asking, or demanding, of property, it<br>\
is trans. [only] by itself or by means of مِنْ [so<br>\
that you say سَأَلَهُ كَذَا and سَأَلَ مِنْهُ كَذَا meaning he asked, or demanded, of him such a thing]:<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA:) and one says also سَالَ, aor.<br>\
يَسَالُ, (Akh, S, M, Msb, K,) like خَافَ, aor. يَخَافُ;<br>\
(Msb, K;) which is of the dial. of Hudheyl; the<br>\
medial letter of this being originally و, as is shown<br>\
by the phrase, mentioned by AZ, هُمَا يَتَسَاوَلَانِ:<br>\
(TA:) [respecting this dial. var., see what follows:] the imperative (S, Msb, K, TA;) of سَأَلَ<br>\
(S, Msb, TA) is اِسْأَلْ; (S, M, Msb, K, TA;) and<br>\
(S, K, &amp;c.) that of سَالَ, (S, Msb, TA,) سَلْ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K, TA,) dual. سَلَا, and pl. سَلُوا, [these two<br>\
being] irregular; (Msb;) and AAF mentions that<br>\
Aboo-&#39;Othmán heard one say اِسَلْ, [a form<br>\
omitted in some copies of the K, but mentioned<br>\
in the CK,] meaning اِسْأَلْ, suppressing the ء, and<br>\
transferring its vowel to the preceding letter, like<br>\
as some of the Arabs said لَحْمَرُ for الأَحْمَرُ [as<br>\
many do in the present day]: (M:) accord. to<br>\
ISd, (TA,) the Arabs universally suppress the ء<br>\
in the imperative except when they prefix to it<br>\
فَ or وَ; (M, TA;) saying فَاسْأَلْ and وَاسْأَلْ:<br>\
(TA:) or when وَ [or فَ] is prefixed, it is allowable to pronounce the ء and also to suppress it, as<br>\
in saying وَاسْأَلُوا and وَسَلُوا: (Msb:) and for the<br>\
pass. سُئِلَ, one may say سِيلَ, and سُيِلَ, in this<br>\
instance making the kesreh to partake of the<br>\
sound of dammeh, and سُولَ; and also سُيِلَ, in<br>\
which the middle letter is pronounced with a<br>\
sound between that of ء and that of ى, or resembling that of و. (IJ, TA.) As Er-Rághib<br>\
says, سُؤَالٌ signifies The asking, or demanding,<br>\
knowledge, or information, or what leads thereto:<br>\
and the asking, or demanding, property, or what<br>\
leads thereto. (TA.) سَأَلْتُهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ means I<br>\
asked of him information respecting the thing:<br>\
(IB, TA: [and the like is said in the Msb:])<br>\
and سَأَلْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ [is sometimes used in the same<br>\
sense, as has been shown above, but generally]<br>\
means I asked him to give me the thing: (IB,<br>\
TA:) you say, سَأَلَهُ مَالًا He asked, demanded, or<br>\
begged, of him property, and in like manner,<br>\
سَأَلَ مِنْهُ and سَأَلَ إِلَيْهِ [followed by مَالًا]: (MA:)<br>\
and سَأَلْتُ اللّٰهَ العَافِيَةَ, inf. n. سُؤَالٌ and مَسْأَلَةٌ, I<br>\
begged, or sought, of God health, or freedom<br>\
from disease, &amp;c. (Msb.) The saying in the<br>\
Kur [lxx. 1], سَأَلَ سَائِلٌ بِعَذَابٍ وَاقِعٍ means عَنْ<br>\
عَذَابٍ [i. e. An asker asked respecting a falling<br>\
punishment]: (S:) [for] one says, خَرَجْنَا نَسْأَلُ<br>\
عَنْ فُلَانٍ and بِفُلَانٍ [meaning We went forth<br>\
asking respecting such a one]: (Akh, S:) or the<br>\
phrase in the Kur means a caller called [for a<br>\
falling punishment]: (TA:) and some read<br>\
سَالَ سَائِلٌ بعذاب واقع, (Bd, TA,) [likewise] from<br>\
السُّؤَالُ: (Bd:) or this means سَالَ وَادٍ بعذاب واقع<br>\
[i. e. a valley flowed with a falling punishment];<br>\
(Bd, TA;) so some say; (TA;) from السَّيَلَانُ.<br>\
(Bd.) The saying, in a trad., نَهَى عَنْ كَثْرَةِ السَّؤَالِ<br>\
[He (Mohammad) forbade much questioning or<br>\
inquiring] is said to relate to subtile questions or<br>\
inquiries, that are needless; like another trad.,<br>\
mentioned below, voce, مَسْأَلَةٌ: or to the begging,<br>\
of men, their property needlessly. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
سَآءَلَهُ, (M, TA,) inf. n. مُسَآءَلَةٌ: (TA:) see 1,<br>\
first sentence. Aboo-Dhu-eyb says,<br>\
أَسَآءَلْتَ رَسْمَ الدَّارِ أَمْ لَمْ تُسَائِلِ<br>\
عَنِ السَّكْنِ أَمْ عَنْ عَهْدِهِ بِالأَوَائِلِ<br>\
[Didst thou ask the remains of the dwelling, or<br>\
didst thou not ask, respecting the inhabitants,<br>\
or respecting their knowledge of the former occupants?]. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In the saying of Bilál<br>\
Ibn-Jereer,<br>\
وَجَدْتَ بِهِمْ عِلَّةً حَاضِرَهْ  إِذَا ضِفْتَهُمْ أَوْ سَآيَلْتَهُمْ<br>\
[When thou becomest their guest, or askest of<br>\
them, thou findest with them a ready excuse],<br>\
سَآيَلْتَهُمْ is a combination of two dial. vars.; the ء<br>\
being in the original phrase سَآءَلْتُ زَيْدًا, and the<br>\
ى being a substitute in the phrase سَايَلْتُ زَيْدًا;<br>\
the measure of سَآيَلْتَهُمْ being فَعَايَلْتَهُمْ: (M, K: *)<br>\
so said Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà, [i. e. Th,] who had<br>\
at first ignored the expression: (M:) and it is an<br>\
instance of which we know not a parallel in the<br>\
language. (M, K. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Accord. to analogy,<br>\
سَآءَلَهَ also signifies He asked him, &amp;c., being<br>\
asked by him, &amp;c. ―<br>\
-b4-  And Freytag states that<br>\
Reiske has explained سَآءَلَ as meaning He always<br>\
demanded that another should express wishes for<br>\
his health: but I know not any instance of its<br>\
being used in this sense.]<br>\
4<br>\
أَسْاَ^َ ↓ أَسْأَلَهُ سُؤْلَهُ, (K,) or ↓ سُؤْلَتَهُ, (S,) and ↓ مَسْأَلَتَهُ,<br>\
(S, K,) He accomplished for him his want.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تسأّل, in the modern language, signifies<br>\
He begged, or asked alms; as also تَسَوَّلَ: both<br>\
probably post-classical.]<br>\
6<br>\
تَسَآءَلُوا They asked, or begged, one another.<br>\
(S, Msb, K.) You say, هُمَا يَتَسَآءَلَانِ, (M,) and<br>\
also يَتَسَاوَلَانِ, (M, Msb, K,) and يَتَسَايَلَانِ.<br>\
(TA.) In the Kur [iv. 1], some read وَاتَّقُوا اللّٰهَ<br>\
الَّذِى تَسَّآءَلُونَ بِهِ; and others, تَسَآءَلُونَ بِهِ: in each<br>\
case, originally تَتَسَآءَلُونَ: the meaning is, [And<br>\
fear ye God,] by Whom ye demand [one of<br>\
another] your rights, or dues: (M:) or by Whom<br>\
ye ask, or demand, one of another; (Bd, Jel;)<br>\
saying, I ask thee, or beg thee, by God; and I<br>\
beseech thee, or adjure thee, by God. (Jel.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
One says also تَسَآءَلُوا القَوْمَ, meaning They [together] asked, or begged, the people. (Mgh in<br>\
art. نقض.)<br>\
سُؤْلٌ, (S, M, K;) also pronounced سُولٌ, without<br>\
ء, (S, K,) [A petition; or a request; meaning]<br>\
a thing that people ask or beg; (S;) or a thing<br>\
that one has asked or begged; (M, K;) as also<br>\
↓ سُؤْلَةٌ, (IJ, M, K,) which is likewise pronounced<br>\
سُولَةٌ, without ء; (K;) and ↓ سُؤُولٌ; (Har p. 422;<br>\
[or this is app. pl. of سُؤْلٌ, like as بُرُوجٌ is of بُرْجٌ,<br>\
and بُرُودٌ of بُرْدٌ, &amp;c.;]) [and ↓ سَأْلَةٌ or سَأَلَةٌ, as<br>\
will be shown by what follows;] and ↓ مَسْؤُولٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) [and ↓ مَسْأَلَةٌ:] see 4: the first of these<br>\
said by Z to be of the measure فُعْلٌ in the sense<br>\
of the measure مَفْعُولٌ; like عُرْفٌ and نُكْرٌ. (TA.)<br>\
Thus in the Kur [xx. 36], قَدْ أُوتِيتَ سُؤْلَكَ يَا مُوسَى<br>\
Thou hast been granted thy petition, or the thing<br>\
that thou hast asked, O Moses. (S, M, TA.) In<br>\
the saying ↓ اَللّٰهُمَّ أَعْطِنَا سَأَلَاتِنَا [O God, grant<br>\
Thou us our petitions], mentioned by Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Alee on the authority of AZ, the inf. n. is used<br>\
as a subst., properly so termed, and is therefore<br>\
pluralized. (M.)<br>\
سَأْلَةٌ or سَأَلَةٌ; pl. سَأَلَاتٌ: see the next preceding<br>\
paragraph, in two places.<br>\
سُؤْلَةٌ: see 4: and see also سْؤْلٌ.<br>\
سُؤَلَةٌ, (S, K,) also pronounced سُوَلَةٌ, (TA,) A<br>\
man (S) who asks, or begs, much; (S, K;) as also<br>\
↓ سَأّلٌ, and ↓ سَؤُولٌ: (TA:) such is improperly<br>\
termed ↓ سَائِلٌ. (Durrat el-Ghowwás, in De<br>\
Sacy&#39;s Anthol. Gramm. Ar., p. 47 of the Ar.<br>\
text.)<br>\
سُؤَالٌ an inf. n. of 1. (S, M, K, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is<br>\
often used as a subst. properly so called; like<br>\
مَسْأَلَةٌ; meaning A question; an interrogation;<br>\
correlative of جَوَابٌ: and a demand, or petition:<br>\
and as such has a pl., سُؤَالَاتٌ; perhaps postclassical.]<br>\
سَؤُولٌ: see سُؤَلَةٌ.<br>\
سُؤُولٌ: see سُؤْلٌ [of which it is app. pl.].<br>\
سَأّلٌ: see سُؤَلَةٌ.<br>\
سَائِلٌ [i. e. Asking; meaning interrogating,<br>\
questioning, or inquiring; and demanding, or<br>\
begging;] has for its pl. سَأَلَةٌ and سُؤَّالٌ. (TA.)<br>\
See سُؤَلَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  It also means [A beggar; i. e.] a<br>\
poor man asking, or begging, a thing. (Er-Rághib, TA.) So it has been expl. as used in<br>\
the Kur [xciii. 10], where it is said, وَأَمَّا السَّائِلَ<br>\
فَلَا تَنْهَرْ [And as for the beggar, thou shalt not<br>\
chide him, or address him with rough speech]:<br>\
or, accord. to El-Hasan, it here means the seeker<br>\
of knowledge. (TA.)<br>\
مَسْأَلَةٌ, an inf. n. of 1, is tropically used in the<br>\
sense of a pass. part. n. [with the noun qualified<br>\
by it understood; meaning (tropical:)  A thing asked; i. e.<br>\
a question; a problem, or proposition; a matter,<br>\
or an affair, proposed for decision or determination]: (TA:) and the pl. is مَسَائِلُ. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
So in the saying, تَعَلَّمْتُ مَسْأَلَةً (tropical:)  [I learned a<br>\
question, or problem, &amp;c.]. (TA.) The saying,<br>\
in a trad., كَرِهَ المَسَائِلَ وَعَابَهَا means (assumed tropical:)  [He<br>\
(Mohammad) disliked and discommended] subtile<br>\
questions, such as are needless. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also سُؤْلٌ: ―<br>\
-b3-  and see 4.<br>\
مَسْؤُولٌ [pass. part. n. of 1: and used as a<br>\
subst.]: see سُؤْلٌ.<br>\
