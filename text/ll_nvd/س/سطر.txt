S, and in some copies of the K,) with kesr to<br>\
the م, (S,) or with teshdeed, [مُسْطَارٌّ,] as written<br>\
by Ks, and this also shows it to be with damm,<br>\
being in this case from إِسْطَارَّ, aor. يَسْطَارُّ, (Sgh,<br>\

also termed ↓ مُسْطَارَةٌ: (Har p. 618:) Az says, it<br>\
is of the dial. of the people of Syria; and I think<br>\
that it is Greek, [or perhaps it is from the Latin<br>\
“ mustarius,” which is from “ mustum,”] because<br>\
it does not resemble an Arabic form: it is with<br>\
ص, or, as some say, with س; and [app. a mistake for “ or ”] I think it to be of the measure<br>\
مُفْتَعَلٌ from صَارَ, with the ت changed into ط.<br>\
