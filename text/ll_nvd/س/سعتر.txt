called بُقُول, (Mgh,) well known; (Msb, K;) and<br>\
applied also to the grain, or seed, thereof:<br>\
(Mgh:) [a species of origanum, or majoram: so<br>\
in the present day; and so says Golius, as on the<br>\
authority of Ibn-Beytár, “origani species, sc.<br>\

“ thymus serpyllum: ”] some write the word in<br>\
books of medicine with ص, in order that [when<br>\
written without the diacritical points] it may not<br>\
be confounded with شَعِيرٌ: (S, Mgh:) in the T,<br>\
it is with ص, on the authority of AA, only; and<br>\
thus in the book of Lth: in the Jámi&#39; of ElGhooree, with س and ص: (Mgh:) or the س is<br>\
changed into ص in the dial. of Bel&#39;ambar [or<br>\
Benu-l-&#39;Ambar]; and some pronounced it only<br>\
with ص: (Msb:) accord. to Abu-l-&#39;Alà, the<br>\
vulgar pronounce it with س, and the approved<br>\
word is with ص. (Ham p. 462.) [In the present<br>\
day, it is also written with ز.]<br>\

noble, or high-born, and courageous, brave, or<br>\
strong-hearted. (K.) The pronunciation with ص<br>\
is of higher authority. (K. [This remark is probably there meant to relate to both of the words<br>\
of this art.])<br>\
