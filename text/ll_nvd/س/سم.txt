indication of the authority.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [And, app., It<br>\

of El-&#39;Áliyeh, (Yoo, Msb, TA,) and is said to be<br>\
the most chaste; (MF, TA;) and ↓ سِمٌّ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) which is [said to be] of the dial. of Temeem,<br>\
(Msb,) [but is thought by SM to be vulgar, and]<br>\
accord. to Yoo, the first is of the dial. of Temeem,<br>\
(TA,) and this is the most common of the three:<br>\
(Msb:) pl. سِمَامٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and سُمُومٌ: (S,<br>\
Msb, K:) and ↓ سَمْسَمٌ signifies the same, in the<br>\

the K, by a mistranscription (وَالسَّمِّ or وَالسُّمِّ for<br>\
والسَّمُّ or وَالسُّمُّ) سَمٌّ or سُمٌّ is made to be syn. with<br>\
سَمْسَمٌ as signifying “ a fox. ” That the right<br>\
reading is that which I have followed is shown in<br>\
the TA by an ex., in which سَمْسَم is spoken of as<br>\
drunk.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] سَمُّ الفَأْرِ Arsenic; [in like<br>\
manner called by us ratsbane;] syn. الشَّكُّ, (K,<br>\

-b4-  And سَمُّ السَّمَكِ The tree<br>\
called مَاهِيزَهْرَهْ [or مَاهِى زَهْرَهْ], (K,) which latter<br>\
appellation is Pers., meaning the same, [i. e.<br>\
“ fish-poison,”] (TA,) and also known by the name<br>\
of البُوصِيرُ: it is beneficial for pains of the joints,<br>\
and pain of the hip and the back, and the نِقْرِس<br>\
[i. e. gout, or specially gout in the foot or feet];<br>\
but the only part of its tree that is beneficial is<br>\
its لِحَآء [or bark]: (K, TA:) when somewhat<br>\
thereof, (K, * TA,) kneaded mith leaven, (TA,)<br>\
is put into a pool of water, it intoxicates the fish<br>\
thereof, (K, TA,) so that they float upon the<br>\
surface of the water: (TA:) and its leaves burn<br>\
in lamps in lieu of wicks, (K, TA,) by reason of<br>\
their oleaginous property. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  سَمُّ أَبْرَصَ:<br>\
see سَامٌّ.<br>\
-A2-  Also, and ↓ سُمٌّ, (S, M, Msb, K,) and<br>\
↓ سِمٌّ, (Msb, K,) [but the last is thought by SM<br>\
to be vulgar, in this sense as well as in the first,]<br>\
A perforation, bore, or hole, (S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
of anything; (M;) or such as is narrow; (TA;)<br>\
for instance, (S, TA,) [the eye] of a needle; (S,<br>\
Msb, TA;) as in the Kur vii. 38; [see جُمَّلٌ;]<br>\
and the hole of the nose, and of the ear: (TA:)<br>\
pl. سُمُومٌ, (M,) or سِمَامٌ, (Msb,) or both. (S, K.)<br>\
The سُمُوم and سِمَام of a human being are His<br>\
mouth and his nostril and his ear, (S,) or his<br>\
mouth and his nostrils and his ears; (K;) and<br>\
the sing. is سَمٌّ and ↓ سُمٌّ: (S:) or the سُمُوم of a<br>\
human being, and of a horse or the like, are the<br>\
clefts (مَشَاقّ) of the skin thereof. (M.) And the<br>\
سُمُوم of the horse are The thin portions of the<br>\
hard bone, [extending] from the two sides of the<br>\
nasal bone to the channels of the tears: sing. سَمٌّ:<br>\
(M:) or, as some say, (M,) the سَمَّانِ, (S, M,)<br>\
or the سَمّ, (K, [but this seems evidently to be a<br>\
mistake for the dual,]) means two veins in the<br>\
nose (أَنْف, M, or خَيْشُوم, S, K, [which latter<br>\
often means the same as the former,]) of the<br>\
horse: (S, M, K:) accord. to Lth, سُمُومٌ, as pl. of<br>\
سَمٌّ, signifies the channels of the tears of the<br>\
horse: AO says that in the face of the horse are<br>\
سُمُوم; and the bareness of his سُمُوم is approved,<br>\
and is regarded as indicative of generous breed.<br>\
(TA.) By the سُمُوم of the horse are also meant<br>\
Any bone [or rather bones] in which is marrow.<br>\
(TA.) And the سُمُوم of a sword are Notches<br>\
therein, whether new or old. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَصَابَ سَمَّ<br>\
حَاجَتِهِ [is app. from سَمٌّ as signifying the “ eye ”<br>\
of a needle, or the like, and] means (assumed tropical:)  He hit, or<br>\
attained, the object of his aim or pursuit: (M,<br>\
K:) and in like manner, هُوَ بَصِيرٌ بِسَمِّ حَاجَتِهِ [He<br>\
is knowing, or skilful, in respect of the object of<br>\
his aim or pursuit]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence, perhaps, though another derivation is asserted in<br>\
what follows,] one says also, مَالَهُ سَمٌّ وَلَا حَمٌّ غَيْرُكَ<br>\
and وَلَا حُمٌّ ↓ سُمٌّ, (S, M,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  He has no<br>\
object in his mind except thee; syn. هَمٌّ: (M:)<br>\
and in like manner, مَالَهُ سَمٌّ وَلَا حَمٌّ and وَلَا ↓ سُمٌّ<br>\
حُمٌّ [alone]: or, accord. to Fr, it means he has<br>\
not any who hopes for him: this is from [سَمَمْتُ<br>\
سَمَّكَ and] حَمَمْتُ حَمَّكَ and هَمَمْتُ هَمَّكَ meaning<br>\
قَصَدْتُ قَصْدَكَ; سَمٌّ and حَمٌّ being the inf. ns., and<br>\
↓ سُمٌّ and حُمٌّ the simple substs.; and the meaning<br>\
is, he has not any who seeks after him; i. e. he<br>\
has no good in him for which he is to be sought<br>\
after: (Meyd:) or it means he has neither little<br>\
nor much. (K and TA in art. حم.) ―<br>\
-b4-  سَمٌّ also<br>\
signifies The loop (عُرْوَة) of the [girth called]<br>\
وَضِين: pl. سُمُومٌ. (TA. [See مُسَمَّمٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\

(As, TA;) as also ↓ سِمَامٌ, [which is shown to be<br>\
thus used as a sing., by a citation from a trad.,<br>\
though said to be] from سِمَامٌ as signifying the<br>\
“ eyes ” (ثُقَب) of the needle [or of needles]: or<br>\
the rima of a woman, with the parts that are<br>\
next to it of the haunch and of the borders of the<br>\

woven, (T, TA,) of خُوص [or leaves] (AHn, T,<br>\
M, K) of the غَضَف [a tree resembling a dwarfpalm-tree]: (AHn, M:) it is spread beneath the<br>\
palm-tree (T, K, TA) when the dates are cut off,<br>\
(T, TA,) and upon it fall what become scattered<br>\
(T, K, TA) of the dates: (T, TA:) pl. سِمَامٌ,<br>\
(AHn, M, TA,) or سُمَمٌ, (K,) or, as in the T,<br>\
سُمُومٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also سَامٌّ, latter part, in two<br>\

or, accord. to the same and Meyd, birds like<br>\
swallows: accord. to Dmr, as stated by Golius,<br>\
i. q. طير ابابيل: but this is app. said in relation to<br>\
an assertion of &#39;Áïsheh, mentioned in art. ابل in<br>\
the Msb, that the birds termed أَبَابِيل in the Kur<br>\

in the night or in the day, (M,) or generally (K)<br>\
in the day, (Msb, K,) but authorities differ<br>\
respecting it, as has been shown voce حَرُورٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) accord. to AO, it is in the day, and<br>\
sometimes in the night; and the حَرُور is in the<br>\
night, and sometimes in the day: (S:) but some<br>\
say that the former is in the night, and the latter<br>\
