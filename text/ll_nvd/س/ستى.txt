سَتَى, (K,) aor. يَسْتِى, said of a camel, (TA,)<br>\
He hastened, made haste, or went quickly; (K,<br>\
TA;) as also سَدَى: mentioned by Az. (TA.)<br>\

سَاْتَىَ ساتاهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُسَاتَاةٌ, (TA,) He played<br>\
with him the [game called] شَفَلَّقَة [expl. in art.<br>\
شفلق in the K as consisting in one&#39;s striking with<br>\
the hand, or with the fore part of the foot, the<br>\
hinder part, or backside, of a man, from behind<br>\
him, and so throwing him down prostrate: whence<br>\
it seems that the verb is perhaps irregularly derived from the سَتَهَهُ, q. v.]. (K.)<br>\

استى الثَّوْبَ (S, K) and ↓ ستّاهُ (M, TA) are<br>\
syn. with اسداهُ (S, K) and سدّاهُ, (M, TA,) [i. e.<br>\
He set, or disposed, the warp of the garment, or<br>\
piece of cloth,] said of a weaver; contr. of أَلْحَمَهُ;<br>\
except that ↓ ستّى means he did so for himself<br>\
and for another, whereas سدّى means he did so<br>\
for another, تسدّى meaning he did so for himself. (TA.)<br>\

إِسْتَوْتَىَ[accord. to the S and K]. اِسْتَاتَتْ, inf. n.<br>\
اِسْتِيتَآءٌ, said of a she-camel, She became relaxed<br>\
by reason of last: (S, K:) thus mentioned here<br>\
by J and in the K; but its proper place, as is<br>\
evident, is art. اتى, in which it has been explained. (TA: see 10 in art. اتى.)<br>\
سَتًى is syn. with سَدًى, (S, M, K,) relating to<br>\
a garment, or piece of cloth; (S, M;) as also<br>\
↓ أُسْتِىٌّ; (K;) both signify [The warp thereof;]<br>\
the contr. of لُحْمَةٌ; like سَدًى and أُسْدِىٌّ: (M:)<br>\
and ↓ سَتَاةٌ is [the n. un. of the former, or] syn.<br>\
with سَدَاةٌ, relating to a garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth: (AZ, S:) [whence,] one says to him who<br>\
neither harms nor profits, ↓ مَا أَنْتَ لُحْمَةٌ وَ لَا سَتَاةٌ<br>\
[lit. Thou art neither a woof nor a warp: see<br>\
also a similar saying voce نِيرٌ]: (TA: [see also<br>\
سَدًى:]) and ↓ أُسْتِىٌّ signifies also ثَوْبٌ مُسْدًى or<br>\
مُسَدًّى (accord. to different copies of the K) [lit.<br>\
a garment, or piece of cloth, having its warp set<br>\
or disposed; perhaps meaning having a good, or<br>\
strong, warp; in art. اسد written, as from the<br>\
L, مَسْدِىٌّ, for which I find no other authority];<br>\
so expl. by AHeyth: but accord. to others, it is<br>\
what the weavers term سَتًى, as mentioned above,<br>\
i. e. the warp. (TA. [See also أُسْتِىٌّ in art. است,<br>\
and أُسْدِىٌّ in art. اسد and in art. سدو and سدى.])<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. مَعْرُوفٌ [as meaning A favour, benefit, benefaction, or the like]; (K;) in this sense<br>\
also a dial. var. of سَدًى. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also a dial.<br>\
var. of سَدًى signifying Dates while continuing<br>\
green and small; syn. بَلَحٌ. (TA.)<br>\
