(Msb,) [He coughed:] سُعْلَةٌ signifies [the having]<br>\
a motion whereby nature expels somewhat hurtful from the lungs and the organs connected<br>\
therewith: (Ibn-Seenà, K, TA:) wherefore the<br>\
ducts of the lungs are called قَصَبُ السُّعَالِ [the<br>\
tubes of coughing, meaning the bronchial tubes,]<br>\
because it [i. e. what is hurtful in the lungs] has<br>\
its exit by them. (TA.) One says, إِنَّهُ يَسْعُلُ سُعْلَةً<br>\
مُنْكَرَةً [Verily he coughs with an abominable<br>\
coughing]. (TA.) And بِهِ سُعْلَةٌ [In him is a<br>\
coughing; i. e. he has a coughing, or cough].<br>\
(TA.) And أَغْصَّكَ السُّؤَالُ فَأَخَذَكَ السُّعَالُ [The<br>\
question, or petition, has choked thee, and consequently coughing has seized thee]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence the saying, رَمَاهُ فَسَعَلَ الدَّمَ [He shot him,<br>\
and he consequently coughed up blood]; i. e.,<br>\
he threw [up] blood from his chest. (TA.)<br>\

(tropical:)  A very clamorous, foul-tongued, woman: (S,<br>\
O, TA:) accord. to Aboo-&#39;Adnán, a woman<br>\
foul in face, evil in disposition, is likened to the<br>\
سِعْلَاة: but some of the Arabs say that the Arabs<br>\
do not apply the epithet سِعْلَاةٌ to any but an old<br>\
woman. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [the pl.] السَّعَالِى signifies<br>\
(tropical:)  Horses; as being likened to what are [properly]<br>\

certain plant, the leaves of which make [the<br>\
ulcers termed] دُبَيْلَات to discharge their contents,<br>\
and dissolves them; and the fresh thereof remove<br>\
the mange, or scab: it is a most excellent remedy<br>\
for the cough; [wherefore it is also called<br>\
حَشِيشَةُ السُّعَالِ; (TK;)] and causes the erection<br>\
of the ذَكَر to subside (وَيَفُشُّ الاِنْتِصَابَ, K, TA,<br>\
for which we find in some copies of the K<br>\
وَنَفْسِ الاِنْتِصَابِ); even the fumigating of oneself<br>\
therewith. (K.)<br>\

[Verily he has a violent cough]: (O, K: *) a phrase<br>\
having an intensive meaning: (K:) by rule one<br>\
should say سُعَال مُسْعِل; but thus the Arabs said,<br>\
like as they said شُغْلٌ شَاغِلٌ and شِعْرٌ شَاعِرٌ: and<br>\
[in like manner] a poet cited by Lth says ذُو سَاعِلٍ.<br>\
(O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also what follows.<br>\
مَسْعَلٌ The part of the fauces, or throat, which<br>\

He walked, went, or went along, (Er-Rághib,<br>\
Msb, K, TA,) quickly: (Er-Rághib, Mgh, TA:)<br>\
this, accord. to Er-Rághib, is the primary signification: and hence, السَّعْىُ بَيْنَ الصَّفَا وَالمَرْوَةِ [The<br>\
tripping to and fro between Es-Safà and ElMarweh]: (TA:) and سَعَى فِى مَشْيِهِ [app.<br>\

is expl. as meaning فَاقْصِدُوا [Then repair ye to<br>\
prayer to God]: (TA:) or then go ye (فَأْمْضُوا)<br>\

(Msb:) he worked, or wrought, or did, (S, Msb,<br>\

i. e. [The slave who had made a contract with his<br>\
master to pay him a certain sum for his emancipation] laboured to earn the means of releasing<br>\
himself: (Msb:) the inf. n. of the verb thus used<br>\
is سعَايَةٌ: (S, Msb:) and this term is employed<br>\
when a slave emancipated in part, and in part<br>\
retained in slavery, labours and earns for the<br>\
completion of his release. (IAth, TA.) The<br>\
saying, in the Kur [liii. 40], لَيْسَ لِلْإِنْسَانِ إِلَّا مَا<br>\
سَعَى means [There is nothing imputable to the<br>\
man] but what he hath wrought, or done. (Msb.)<br>\

meaning He exacted the poor-rate:] a poet says,<br>\
(namely, &#39;Amr Ibn-&#39;Addà, TA,)<br>\
سَعَى عِقَالًا فَلَمْ يَتْرُكْ لَنَا سَبَدًا<br>\
فَكَيْفَ لَوْ قَدْ سَعَى عَمْرٌو عِقَالَيْنِ<br>\
[He exacted the poor-rate of a year, and left not<br>\
to us camels&#39; fur, or goats&#39; hair: then how would<br>\
be the case if &#39;Amr had exacted the poor-rate of<br>\
two years?]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b6-  سَعَيْتُ فِى أَمْرِ فُلَانٍ is said<br>\

xxii. 50 [and xxxiv. 5], means And they who<br>\
strive, or labour, in respect of our signs, to mar,<br>\
or vitiate, or pervert, their meaning, by impugning their character; seeing that they called<br>\
them enchantment, and poetry, and tales, or<br>\
legends, or fictions: (Ksh in xxii. 50:) or these<br>\
words of the Kur mean and they who strive, or<br>\
labour, to falsify, or nullify, our signs; i. e. the<br>\
Kur-án. (Jel.) ―<br>\
-b7-  سَعَى بَيْنَهُمْ means He created,<br>\
or excited, disorder, or discord, between them, or<br>\
among them; made, or did, mischief between<br>\
them, or among them; as also سَأَا, which is app.,<br>\
in this case, a dial. var. of سَعَى. (TA in art.<br>\
سأو.) [Hence,] سَعَى بَيْنَ النَّاسِ بِالنَّمَائِمِ [He<br>\
created, or excited, disorder, &amp;c., among the<br>\
people by calumnies, or slanders: or it may be<br>\

means [Such a one strove with me in walking,<br>\
or going along, quickly, &amp;c.,] and I overcame<br>\
him [therein]. (S, TA.) The inf. n. مُسَاعَاةٌ signifies The walking, or going, quickly [&amp;c., or rather<br>\
the striving, or contending, in doing so,] with any<br>\
one. (KL.) Hence the trad. of &#39;Alee, in discommendation of worldly enjoyments, مَنْ سَاعَاهَا<br>\
فَاتَتْهُ, meaning مَنْ سَابَقَهَا [i. e. He who runs a<br>\
race with them, they evade him, or escape his<br>\
pursuit]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مُسَاعَاةٌ also signifies One&#39;s<br>\
committing fornication with a female slave: and<br>\
a female slave&#39;s committing fornication with any<br>\
one: (KL:) you say, of a man, زَنَى and عَهَرَ, and<br>\
this is with a free woman and with a female<br>\
slave; but one says in the case of a female slave,<br>\
peculiarly, قَدْ سَاعَاهَا [He has committed fornication with her]; مُسَاعَاةٌ not being with any but<br>\
with female slaves: thus in a trad., إِمَآءٌ سَاعَيْنَ<br>\
فِى الجَاهِلِيَّةِ [Female slaves that committed fornication in the Time of Ignorance]: and أُتِىَ عُمَرَ<br>\
بِرَجُلٍ سَاعَى أَمَةً [There was brought to &#39;Omar a<br>\
man who committed fornication with a female<br>\
slave]: (S, TA: *) [and hence, وَلَدُ المُسَاعَاةِ (occurring in the L, in art. بهث, as mentioned by<br>\
IAar on the authority of Abu-l-Mekárim), meaning The offspring of fornication, begotten on a<br>\
slave:] or ساعاها, (K, TA,) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(TA,) signifies [or rather signifies also] He<br>\
sought her for the purpose of fornication: (K,<br>\
[in which the context seems to indicate that it<br>\
relates to a female slave,] and TA:) accord. to<br>\
Th, relating to the free woman and the female<br>\
slave: it is also said that مُسَاعَاةُ المَرْأَةِ signifies<br>\
The imposing upon the woman, by her owner, an<br>\
impost which she is to pay by means of [the gain<br>\
of] prostitution: and it is said in a trad. that<br>\
there shall be no مُسَاعَاة in El-Islám. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
[It is said in the TA in art. ربع, that مُسَاعَاةٌ from<br>\
السَّاعَةُ is like مَُشَاهَرَةٌ from الشَّهْرُ and مُرَابَعَةٌ from<br>\
الرَّبِيعُ &amp;c.; but I think that مساعاة in this instance<br>\
is a mistranscription for مُسَاوَعَةٌ: see art. سوع.]<br>\
4<br>\
اسعاهُ signifies جَعَلَهُ يَسْعَى, (K, TA,) i. e.<br>\
He made him to earn, or gain. (TA.) ―<br>\

أَسْعَوْا بِهِ They gave him, or performed or accomplished for him, what he desired, or sought, or<br>\

Msb) He required of the slave that he should<br>\
labour to earn the means of releasing himself:<br>\
(Msb:) or he imposed upon the slave work by<br>\
means of which he should pay for himself, when<br>\

completing his emancipation: and ↓ سِعَايَةٌ signifies<br>\
the work so imposed. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And استسعاهُ He<br>\
employed him as collector of the poor-rate.<br>\

signifying The act of running, and working, and<br>\
earning or gaining, [&amp;c., when used as a simple<br>\
subst.,] has for its pl. مَسَاعٍ. (Har p. 384.)<br>\
مَسْعاةٌ A means of attaining honour and eminence or elevation, in the various kinds of glory;<br>\
(K;) a good, or laudable, act or endeavour;<br>\
generosity: pl. مَسَاعٍ. (MA.) [See an ex. voce<br>\
مَدْعَاةٌ, and another voce أَقْعَدَ.] J says, [in the<br>\
S,] المَسْعَاةُ وَاحِدَةُ المَسَاعِى فِى الكَلَامِ وَالجُودِ:<br>\
and the author of the K, following Sgh, says<br>\
that he has committed a mistake in saying فِى<br>\
الكَلَامِ instead of فِى الكَرَمِ: in some copies of the<br>\
S is found فِى الكَرَمِ; but this is an emendation:<br>\
the original reading is فِى الكَلَامِ: which, however,<br>\
should be termed a slip of the pen [rather than a<br>\
mistake, for it cannot be that J was ignorant of<br>\
the meaning of so common a word as مَسْعَاةٌ].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَسْعِىٌّ بِهِ Calumniated, or slandered, [and<br>\
especially] to a ruler, or magistrate. (TA.)<br>\
