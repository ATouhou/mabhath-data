[Hence, app., unless the reverse be the case, the<br>\
inf. n.] سَوَجَانٌ signifies The act of going and<br>\
coming: (AA, O, K, TA:) asserted by some to<br>\
be سَوْجَانٌ, [and thus it is in the CK,] but this is<br>\
a mistake. (TA.) You say, سَاجَ, aor. يَسُوجُ, inf.<br>\
n. سَوْجٌ [and سَوَجَانٌ], He, or it, went and came.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\

(IAar, O,) inf. n. سَوْجٌ and سُوَاجٌ and سَوَجَانٌ,<br>\
He went along gently, softly, or in a leisurely<br>\
manner. (IAar, O, K.) IAar cites the following<br>\

الجِلْبِحِ ↓ غَرَّآءَ لَيْسَتْ بِالسَّؤُوجِ<br>\
[A female fair in face: she is not the ugly old<br>\
woman that goes along gently, or softly, by reason<br>\
of decrepitude]. (O.)<br>\

made a سِيَاج, i. e. an enclosure (A, Msb) composed of thorns and the like, (Msb,) around the<br>\
grape-vines (A, Msb) and the like; as also سيّج,<br>\
with ى, agreeably with the word سياج [from<br>\
which it is derived]: (Msb:) and سيّج حَائِطَهُ,<br>\
inf. n. تَسْيِيجٌ, he made an enclosure (K and TA<br>\
in art. سيج) of thorns and the like (TA in that<br>\

سَاجٌ [The teak-tree; tectona grandis; to which<br>\
the name of ساج is applied in Pers.; remarkable<br>\
for its huge size, and enormous leaves: or the<br>\
Indian, or Oriental, plane-tree: or the Indian<br>\
plantain-tree: (see De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Ar., sec.<br>\

(Mgh, Msb;) so they say: (Mgh:) Z says,<br>\
(Msb,) it is a black, heavy, wood, which is brought<br>\
from India, (A, Msb,) in pieces made of an oblong<br>\
form, and squared, (A,) and which the woodfretter can hardly, or not at all, wear, or waste;<br>\
(A, Msb;) and he says that its pl. is سِيجَانٌ:<br>\
(Msb: [but this is said in the A only to be pl. of<br>\
ساج meaning “ a rounded, wide, طَيْلَسَان: ”])<br>\
some say that it resembles ebony, but is less black:<br>\
(Msb:) accord to the A, Noah&#39;s ark was made<br>\
of it: but several authors say that it is related in<br>\
the Book of the Law revealed to Moses that it<br>\
was made of the صَنَوْبَر [or pine-tree]; and some<br>\
say that the صنوبر is a species of the ساج: (TA:)<br>\
AHn describes it, (O, TA,) on the authority of<br>\
one who had seen it in its places of growth, (O,)<br>\
as a species of tree that grows to a great size, tall<br>\
and wide, having leaves like the shields of the<br>\
Deylem (الدَّيْلَم, q. v.), with one of which leaves a<br>\
man may cover himself, and it will protect him<br>\
from the rain, and it has a sweet odour, like the<br>\
odour of the leaves of the walnut, and is fine and<br>\
soft, or smooth; (O, TA,) the elephants [he says]<br>\
are fond of it, and of the leaves of the banana,<br>\
both of which they eat: it is not of the trees<br>\
that grow in the land of the Arabs, nor does it<br>\
grow in any country except those of India and<br>\
the Zenj; nor does any tree grow so tall, nor<br>\
any so big: (O:) ↓ سَاجَةٌ is the n. un.; and its<br>\
pl. is سَاجَاتٌ: (Msb:) and it signifies a piece of<br>\
wood of the tree called ساج, made of an oblong<br>\
form, and squared, as brought from India; (A, *<br>\
Mgh, TA;) such as is cut and prepared for a<br>\
foundation and the like: (Mgh:) one says, فِى<br>\

building is a piece of wood of the ساج cut in an<br>\
oblong form, and squared]: (A:) a ساجة from<br>\

also applied to the board, or tablet, [of wood of<br>\
the ساج,] upon which stand [or rest] the two<br>\
scales of the balance when one weighs with it.<br>\

قَلَانِس [pl. of قَلَنْسُوَةٌ, q. v.,] as were [made] of<br>\

applied to signify (tropical:)  A [garment of the kind called]<br>\
كِسَآء made of a square form, or four-sided; and<br>\
is described as a sort of مِلْحَفَة, woven. (TA.)<br>\
As meaning a طيلسان, it is said by some, that its<br>\
