اسقمهُ, (S, Msb, TA,) inf. n. إِسْقَامٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ سقّمهُ, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. تَسْقِيمٌ; (TA;)<br>\
He (God) [or it] caused him to be, or become,<br>\
diseased, disordered, distempered, sick, or ill: (S,<br>\

(Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  And أَسْقَمَ الرَّجُلُ The man had his<br>\
family affected with diseases, and the diseases<br>\
came afterwards upon him. (TA.)<br>\
سُقْمٌ and ↓ سَقَمٌ and ↓ سَقَامٌ [are all inf. ns.; or<br>\
the last, accord. to the Msb, is a simple subst.;<br>\
and all are used as substs., signifying] A disease,<br>\
disorder, distemper, malady, sickness, or an<br>\
illness; syn. مَرَضٌ: (S, K, TA:) سُقْمٌ and مَرَضٌ<br>\
are both said to be in the body, and also (assumed tropical:)  in<br>\
religion [&amp;c., as is implied by phrases mentioned<br>\
below, voce سَقِيمٌ]: (Aboo-Is-hák, TA in art.<br>\
مرض:) pl. [of the first] أَسْقَامٌ. (TA.) ↓ سَقَمُ<br>\
الجُفُونِ means (assumed tropical:)  Languidness, and slowness in<br>\
motion, of the eyelids. (Har p. 113.)<br>\
سَقَمٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
سَقِمٌ: see سَقِيمٌ.<br>\
سَقَامٌ: see سُقْمٌ.<br>\
سَقِيمٌ Diseased, disordered, distempered, sick,<br>\
or ill; (S, K, TA;) as also ↓ سَقِمٌ: (TA:) or long<br>\
diseased &amp;c.: (Msb:) pl. of the former سِقَامٌ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) like كِرَامٌ pl. of كَرِيمٌ. (Msb.) See<br>\
also مِسْقَامٌ, and مُسْقِمٌ. The phrase إِنِي سَقِيمٌ,<br>\
occurring in the Kur [xxxvii. 87], as a saying of<br>\
Abraham, is expl. by some as meaning [Verily I<br>\
am] smitten with the طَاعُون [or pestilence]: or<br>\
the meaning is, I shall be diseased at a future<br>\
time, when the period shall have come; and it is<br>\
said that he inferred, from looking at the stars,<br>\
the time of a fever&#39;s coming to him: or it means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  verily I am sick of your worshipping what is<br>\
not God: IAth says that, in truth, it is one of his<br>\
three lies; all of which were for the sake of God<br>\
and his religion. (TA.) You say also قَلْبٌ سَقِيمٌ<br>\
(tropical:)  [A diseased, a sickly, or an unsound, heart]:<br>\
and فَهْمٌ سَقِيمٌ (tropical:)  [Diseased, unsound, faulty, or<br>\
weak, understanding]: and كَلَامٌ سَقِيمٌ (tropical:)  [Unsound, faulty, or weak, language]. (TA.) And<br>\
هُوَ سَقِيمُ الصَّدْرِ عَلَيْهِ (tropical:)  He is affected with rancour,<br>\
malevolence, malice, or spite, against him. (TA.)<br>\
سَوْقَمٌ A kind of tree resembling the خِلَاف<br>\
[q. v.], but not the same as this latter: (TA:) or<br>\
a kind of large tree, (AHn, K, TA,) exactly like<br>\
the أَثْأَب, (AHn, TA,) which is a tree of the figkind, (TA in art. ثأب,) except that it is taller<br>\
than the latter, and less broad, having a fruit<br>\
like the fig (التِين), which, when green, is [like]<br>\
stone in hardness, but when it ripens it becomes<br>\
somewhat yellow, and soft, and very sweet, and<br>\
of a pleasant odour, and people send it, one to<br>\
another, as a present. (AHn, TA.) [Forskål, in<br>\
his Flora Aegypt. Arab., p. cxxiv., mentions<br>\
سقم, which is evidently a mistranscription for<br>\
سوقم, and which he writes in Italic letters<br>\
“ sokam,” as one of the names of the ficus sycomorus; and app. of another species or variety of<br>\
fig which he terms ficus sycomoroides.]<br>\

مِسْقَامٌ i. q. ↓ سَقِيمٌ [Diseased, disordered, &amp;c.]:<br>\
(TA:) or [rather, agreeably with analogy,]<br>\
much, or often, diseased &amp;c.: (S, TA:) and<br>\
accord. to Lh it is also applied as an epithet to a<br>\
female. (TA.)<br>\
