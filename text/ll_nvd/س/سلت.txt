سَلَتَ المِعَى, aor.<br>\
سَلِتَ, (M, K) and<br>\
سَلُتَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. سَلْتٌ, (M, TA,) He extracted, or made<br>\
to come forth, [the contents of] the gut [by<br>\
compressing it] with his hand. (M, K. [In both<br>\
it is expl. by أَخْرَجَهُ بِيَدِهِ: but it seems that a<br>\
fault has been accidentally committed by a copyist<br>\
in the former or in its original, and thence passed<br>\
into the latter; and that the words which I have<br>\
supplied are necessary to explain the true meaning. That such is the case, appears from what<br>\
here follows.]) It is said in the L that السَّلْتُ<br>\
signifies The griping, with the hand, a thing that<br>\
is contaminated by dirt, or filth, so that what is<br>\
in it comes forth; and thus is done with a gut.<br>\
(TA.) It is also said to signify The extracting,<br>\
or causing to come forth, what is fluid, or moist,<br>\
adhering to another thing. (MF, TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
سَلَتَ خَمْشَهُ i. e. مُخَاطَهُ عَنْ أَنْفِهِ [He cleansed<br>\
his nose of the mucus that was in it by compressing it with his fingers]: occurring in two<br>\
trads.; in one of which, the Prophet is related to<br>\
have been in the habit of doing this to El-Hoseyn<br>\
when he used to carry him upon his shoulder.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence, likewise,] it is said in a trad.,<br>\
فَيَنْفُذُ الجَحِيمُ إِلَى جَوْفِهِ فَيَسْلُتُ مَافِيهِ, i. e. [And<br>\
the fire of Hell shall penetrate to his inside, and]<br>\
shall exscind and extirpate what is in it. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  You say also, سَلَتَ القَصْعَةَ, (S, A, K,) aor.<br>\
سَلُتَ,<br>\
inf. n. سَلْتٌ; (S;) and ↓ استلتها; (K;) He cleansed<br>\
the bowl by taking off with his finger what<br>\
remained upon its sides; (S;) he wiped the bowl<br>\
(A, K) with his fingers (A) or with his finger.<br>\
(K.) And سَلَتَتْ خِضَابَهَا عَنْ يَدِهَا, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
سَلُتَ, inf. n. سَلْتٌ, (Msb,) She cast from her,<br>\
or from her hand, the remains of her stuff for<br>\
dyeing the hands or hair: (S, K:) or she put<br>\
away, or removed, that stuff from her hand:<br>\
(Msb:) or she wiped off, and cast away, that<br>\
stuff from her hand: (TA:) or سَلَتَ الخِضَابَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
سَلُتَ, he took away, and wiped off, the material<br>\
for dyeing the hands or hair; and in like manner.<br>\
a similar thing; and sweat; and blood. (Mgh.)<br>\
سَلَتَ الدَّمَ عَنْهَا occurs in a trad. as meaning He<br>\
removed the blood [from her or it]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
سَلَتَ دَمَ البَدَنَةِ (M, K) means, accord. to Lh, He<br>\
scraped off the blood of the بدنة [or beast brought<br>\
to Mekkeh for sacrifice, or there sacrificed,]<br>\
with the knife: but [ISd says, (and in like<br>\
manner هَلَتَ دَمَ البَدَنَةِ is expl. in the L as on the<br>\
authority of Lh,)] in my opinion the meaning is,<br>\
he scraped off the skin of the بدنة with the knife<br>\
so that he made its blood to appear. (M. [The<br>\
explanation in the K is made up from the two<br>\
different explanations in the M, being as follows:<br>\
قَشَرَهُ حَتَّى أَظْهَرَ دَمَهَا, as though meaning he scraped<br>\
off the dried blood of the بدنة so that he made its<br>\
fresh blood to appear: but in the copy of the K<br>\
followed in the TA, النَّدَبَة (i. e. the scar) is put in<br>\
the place of البَدَنَة, and the former of these two<br>\
(i. e. الندبة) I regard as the right word.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  سَلَتَ<br>\
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He cut off a thing. (K. [This is<br>\
said in the TA to be the primary meaning: but<br>\
accord. to the A, the phrase here following,<br>\
in which it has this meaning, is tropical.]) You<br>\
say, سَلَتَ أَنْفَهُ, (S, M, A, K,) aor.<br>\
سَلِتَ and<br>\
سَلُتَ,<br>\
inf. n. سَلْتٌ, (M,) (tropical:)  He cut off his nose (S, M,<br>\
A, K) entirely (TA) with a sword. (S, A.) And<br>\
سَلَتَ يَدَهُ بِالسَّيْفِ (assumed tropical:)  He cut off his hand, or arm,<br>\
with the sword. (M.) And سَلَتَ شَعَرَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
shaved off his hair. (M, K.) And سَلَتَ رَأْسَهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  He shaved his head. (As, S, L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  سَلَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
beat, struck, or smote, him: (K, TA:) and<br>\
flogged him. (TA.) You say, سَلَتُّهُ مِائَةَ سَوْطٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I inflicted upon him a hundred strokes of the<br>\
whip. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And سَلَتَ بِسَلْحِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He cast<br>\
forth his excrement, or ordure. (K.)<br>\
7<br>\
انسلت عَنَّا He stole, or slipped, away from<br>\
us without his being known to do so. (M, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِسْتَلَتَ see 1, in the former half of the paragraph.<br>\
سُلْتٌ A species of شَعِير [or barley], (Lth, S, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) having no hush, (Lth, S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) أَجْرَدُ [which may mean either beardless<br>\
or smooth], (Lth,) [in appearance] as though it<br>\
were wheat, (S,) growing in El-Ghowr and El-<br>\
Hijáz; (Mgh, Msb;) the سَوِيق [or meal of the<br>\
parched grain] whereof is employed as a cooling<br>\
diet in the صَيْف [or summer]: (TA:) or i. q.<br>\
شَعِير [i. e. the common barley]; (M, K;) as some<br>\
say: (M:) or the sour (حَامِض) sort of شعير:<br>\
(M, K:) or a white شعير, without husk: or, as<br>\
some say, a species of wheat; but the explanation<br>\
next preceding this last is the more correct, for<br>\
البَيْضَآءُ and السُّلْتُ are mentioned in a trad. as<br>\
distinct, each from the other, and by the former<br>\
is meant wheat: (TA:) or a species of شعير with<br>\
a thin husk and small grain: (IF, Msb:) or a<br>\
grain between wheat and barley (شعير), not<br>\
having a husk like that of the latter, and thus<br>\
being like wheat in smoothness, and like barley<br>\
(شعير) in its nature, or quality, and in its coolness: (Az, Msb:) accord. to Es-Seydelánee, like<br>\
barley (شعير) in its form, and like wheat in its<br>\
nature, or quality; but this is a mistake: (Ibn-Es-Saláh, Msb:) [gymnocrithon (i. e. hordeum<br>\
nudym) of Galen: tragus of Diosc. (Golius.)]<br>\
ذَهَبَ مِنِّى فَلْتَةً وَسَلْتَةً It (a thing, or an affair,<br>\
TA) escaped me: (K, TA:) accord. to some,<br>\
سلتة is here an imitative sequent. (TA.)<br>\
سَلْتَآءُ A woman who does not make frequent<br>\
use of حِنَّآء [for tinging, or dyeing, her hands];<br>\
(S;) a woman who does not frequently tinge her<br>\
hands with خِضَاب: (M:) or a woman who does<br>\
not make use of خِضَاب for herself (M, A, K) at<br>\
all: so some say. (M.) It is related of the<br>\
Prophet, in a trad., that he cursed such a woman.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
سُلَاتَةٌ What is extracted, or made to come<br>\
forth, (M, K, *) from a gut [by compressing it]<br>\
with the hand. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  What is taken off with<br>\
the finger from the sides of a bowl, to clean it.<br>\
(S, K. *)<br>\
أَسْلَتُ A man (S) whose nose has been cut off<br>\
(S, M, K) entirely. (S, K.)<br>\
مِسْلَاتُ حِنَّآءُ [app. An instrument with which<br>\
حنّآء is scraped off, or removed, from the hand].<br>\
One says, أَعْطِنِى مِسْلَاتَ حِنَّائِكَ [Give thou to<br>\
me &amp;c.]. (A.)<br>\
مَسْلُوتٌ That whereof the flesh that was upon<br>\
it has been taken off or away, or removed. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And A shaven head. (As, S, L.)<br>\
