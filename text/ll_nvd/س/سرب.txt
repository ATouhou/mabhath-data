سَرَبَ aor.<br>\
سَرُبَ, inf. n. سُرُوبٌ, He went forth:<br>\

so the inf. n., (M, A, Msb,) He went away [into<br>\
the country, or in the land]. (M, A, Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
And سَرَبَ فِى حَاجَتِهِ He went, or went away,<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, M,) or, as some say, during the day,<br>\
(M,) for the accomplishment of his want.<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, M.) And هُوَ يَسْرُبُ النَّهَارَ كُلَّهُ فِى<br>\
حَوَائِجِهِ [He goes, or goes away, all the day,<br>\
accomplishing his wants]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سَرَبَ [or rather<br>\
سَرَبَ فِى الأَرْضِ] also signifies He (a man) went<br>\
away at random into the country, or in the land.<br>\
(Har pp. 448 and 511.) A poet says, (S,) namely,<br>\
Keys Ibn-El-Khateem, (TA,)<br>\
↓ أَنَّى سَرَبْتِ وَكُنْتِ غَيْرَ سَرُوبِ<br>\
[i. e. Whence hast thou gone away at random?<br>\
for thou wast not one wont to go away at<br>\
random:] (S, TA:) thus, سربت, as related by<br>\
IDrd: accord. to others, [سَرَيْتِ,] with ى.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  سَرَبَتِ الإِبِلُ, aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
The camels went away into the country, or in the<br>\
land, going forth whithersoever they would: and<br>\
in like manner سَرَبَ is said of a stallion [camel]&#39;:<br>\
(Az, TA:) or سَرَبَ, (S, K,) said of a stallion<br>\
[camel], aor. as above, (S,) and so the inf. n.,<br>\
signifies he repaired, or betook himself, to the<br>\
place of pasture: (S, A, K:) and سَرَبَ المَالُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
سَرُبَ, inf. n. سَرْبٌ, the camels, or cattle, pastured<br>\
during the day without a pastor. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
سَرَبَ المَآءُ, (A, Mgh, Msb,) aor. as above, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. سُرُوبٌ; (Mgh, Msb;) or سَرِبَ, [aor.<br>\
سَرَبَ,]<br>\
inf. n. سَرَبٌ; (M;) The water ran (A, Mgh)<br>\
upon the surface of the ground: (A:) or flowed;<br>\
as also ↓ انسرب: (M:) [or the latter signifies it<br>\
ran swiftly: (see Har p. 586:)] and in like<br>\
manner one says of the سَرَاب [or mirage], يَسْرَبُ,<br>\
inf. n. سَرَبٌ, it runs. (AHeyth, TA.) And<br>\
سَرِبَتِ العَيْنُ, inf. n. سَرَبٌ; and سَرَبَتْ, aor.<br>\
سَرُبَ,<br>\
inf. n. سُرُوبٌ; The عين [or source, or perhaps<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  eye, (see مَسْرَبٌ,)] flowed; as also ↓ تسرّبت:<br>\
so says Lh. (M.) And سَرِبَتِ المَزَادَةُ, aor.<br>\
سَرَبَ, (S,<br>\
K,) inf. n. سَرَبٌ, (S,) The مزادة [or leathern<br>\
water-bag] flowed. (S, K.) And خَرَجَ المَآءُ سَرَبًا<br>\
The water came forth from the punctures made<br>\
in sewing the skin. (TA.) [Or] سَرِبَتْ said of a<br>\
new [water-skin such as is termed] قِرْبَة, or of a<br>\
مَزَادَة, signifies It had water poured into it in<br>\
order that the thong [with which it was sewed]<br>\
might become moistened, so as to swell, and fill<br>\
up the holes made in the sewing. (M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See<br>\
also سَرَبٌ, below. ―<br>\
-b6-  [Golius explains سَرَبَ, inf. n.<br>\
سَرَبَانٌ, as on the authority of the KL, as signifying “ Ingressus fuit in rem, totum subivit implevitve<br>\
locum: ” but this is a mistake, evidently occasioned by his finding سَرَبَانٌ, explained in this<br>\
sense, instead of سَرَيَان, the reading in my copy<br>\
of the KL.]<br>\
-A2-  سَرْبٌ [as an inf. n.] is [also] syn.<br>\
with خَرْزٌ [signifying The sewing of a skin or the<br>\
like]. (Kr, K, TA. [In a copy of the M, I find<br>\
السَّرَبُ الخَرَزُ erroneously written for السَّرْبُ الخَرْزُ.])<br>\
You say, سَرَبْتُ القِرْبَةَ, inf. n. سَرْبٌ, I sewed the<br>\
قربة [i. e. water-skin, or milk-skin]. (TK.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
سُرِبَ, (M, K,) like عُنِىَ, [i. e. pass. in form but<br>\
neuter in signification,] (K,) said of a man,<br>\
(TA,) He became affected with suppression of<br>\
the feces, or constipation of the bowels, (أَخَذَهُ حُصْرٌ<br>\
or حَصَرٌ accord. to different copies of the K,) by<br>\
the entrance of the fume of [molten] silver [see<br>\
أُسْرُبٌّ] into the innermost parts of his nose, and<br>\
other passages, (K,) or into his mouth, and the<br>\
innermost parts of his nose, and his anus, (M, *<br>\
TA,) and other passages: (TA:) the epithet applied to a man thus affected is ↓ مَسْرُوبٌ: (K:)<br>\
sometimes he recovers, and sometimes he dies.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

سَرَّبَ [سرّب app. signifies, primarily, He sent<br>\
camels in a herd or drove, together, to pasture.<br>\
And hence, ―<br>\
-b2- ] سرّب عَلَىَّ الإِبِلَ (tropical:)  He sent<br>\
[against me] the camels [app. with armed riders],<br>\
one detached number after another: (As, S, A,<br>\
K, TA:) and in like manner, الخَيْلَ (tropical:)  [the horsemen]. (S, A, Mgh, TA.) It is said in a trad. of<br>\
&#39; Áïsheh, [referring to girls who were her playmates,] كَانَ يُسَرِّبُهُنَّ إِلَىَّ فَيَلْعَبْنَ مَعِى (assumed tropical:)  He used<br>\
to send them to me [app. party after party, and<br>\
they would play with me]. (TA.) And one says,<br>\
سَرَّبْتُ إِلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ (assumed tropical:)  I sent to him the thing, one<br>\
by one; or rather, portion by portion. (L, TA.)<br>\
And سَرَّبْتُ إِلَيْهِ الأَشْيَآءَ (tropical:)  I gave him the things,<br>\
one after another. (A, TA.) And سَرَّبَهُ He sent<br>\
him back in his سرب [i. e. سَرْب], meaning way<br>\
[by which he had come]. (Har p. 20.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See<br>\
also 4.<br>\
-A2-  سرّب سَرَبًا He made a subterranean<br>\
excavation. (M, A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سرّب الحَافِرُ, (As, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. تَسْرِيبٌ, (S, K,) The digger [of a well], in<br>\
digging, took [i. e. dug] towards the right and left:<br>\
(As, S, * K, * TA:) in some copies of the K, [and<br>\
in the S,] right or left: but the former is the<br>\
correct explanation. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  سرّب القِرْبَةَ, (S,<br>\
M, A,) inf. n. as above, (K,) He poured water<br>\
into the قربة [i. e. water-skin, or milk-skin], in<br>\
order that the holes made in the sewing might<br>\
become filled up (S, M, A, K) by their being<br>\
moistened, (S, K,) or by the moistening, and consequent swelling, of the thong [with which it was<br>\
sewed]; the قربة being new. (M.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسرب He made water to flow; as also<br>\
↓ سرّب. (M.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَسَرَّبَ see 1, near the middle of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence, app.,] تسرّبوا فِيهِ (assumed tropical:)  They followed one<br>\
another continuously in it; namely, a road.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 7.<br>\
-A2-  تسرّب مِنَ المَآءِ He became<br>\
full of water. (TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْسَرَبَ see 1, near the middle of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
انسرب فِيهِ He entered into it; (S, M, K;) i. e.,<br>\
a wild animal, into his سَرَب, (S, M, Msb,) meaning his subterranean habitation, (S, Msb,) or his<br>\
place of abode; (M;) and a fox, (S,) into his<br>\
burrow; as also ↓ تسرّب. (S, K.)<br>\
سَرْبٌ Pasturing مَال, (M, A, TA,) i. e. camels:<br>\
(M, TA:) or camels, and مَال [here meaning<br>\
cattle in general], that pasture: (S:) or مَال [i. e.<br>\
camels or cattle] pasturing during the day without a pastor; an inf. n. used as a subst. in this<br>\
sense; and ↓ سَارِبٌ [meaning مَالٌ سَارِبٌ] signifies<br>\
the same: (Msb:) or, accord. to IAar, (M,) any<br>\
مَاشِيَة [i. e. camels and other cattle]; (M, K;)<br>\
thus say IJ and Ibn-Hishám El-Lakhmee: and<br>\
accord. to Kz, ↓ سِرْبٌ also, [q. v.,] with kesr,<br>\
signifies مَالٌ [syn. with مَاشِيَةٌ]; and IO says the<br>\
like: (TA:) pl. of the former سُرُوبٌ, (M, TA,)<br>\
and some say أَسْرَابٌ [which is a pl. of pauc.].<br>\
(TA.) Hence the saying, اِذْهَبْ فَلَا أَنْدَهُ سَرْبَكَ,<br>\
i. e. Go thou away, for I will not drive back thy<br>\
[pasturing] camels; (S, Msb; *) they shall go,<br>\
(S,) or I will leave them to pasture, (Msb,)<br>\
where they will; (S, Msb;) meaning, I have no<br>\
need of thee: (S:) in the Time of Ignorance,<br>\
they used to divorce by saying thus, (S, M, Msb,)<br>\
اِذْهَبِى فَلَا أَنْدَهُ سَرْبَكِ. (S, M, A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Freytag<br>\
also explains it, from the Deewán el-Hudhaleeyeen,<br>\
as meaning A sheep-fold.]<br>\
-A2-  Also A way, or<br>\
road; (AZ, S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) and so<br>\
↓ سِرْبٌ with kesr; (M, K;) the latter accord. to<br>\
Aboo-&#39; Omar and Th, but&#39; disallowed by Mbr, who<br>\
knew only the former in this sense; said by Ibn-Es-Seed to have been pronounced by AZ with<br>\
fet-h, and by Aboo-&#39; Omar with kesr: (TA:) and<br>\
one&#39;s way, or course; (M, K, * TA;) the way by<br>\
which one goes. (T, TA. [See also سُرْبَةٌ, and<br>\
مَسْرَبٌ.]) One says, خَلِّ سَرْبَهُ Leave thou free,<br>\
or unobstructed, his way (T, M, Mgh, Msb, TA)<br>\
by which he goes, (T, TA,) and his course; (M,<br>\
TA;) and so ↓ سِرْبَهُ, with kesr; (M, TA;) accord.<br>\
to Aboo-&#39; Omar: (TA:) or خَلِّ لَهُ سَرْبَهُ leave thou<br>\
free, or unobstructed, to him his way. (S, A.)<br>\
And أَطْلَقَ الأَسِيرَ وَخَلَّى سَرْبَهُ [He loosed the captive and left free to him his way]. (A.) Hence,<br>\
in a trad., مَنْ أَصْبَحَ آمِنًا فِى سَرْبِهِ, meaning<br>\
فِى مُتَقَلَّبِهِ and مُتَصَرَّفِهِ [i. e. He who has become<br>\
secure in his scope, or room, for free action]: or,<br>\
accord. to one reading, the last words are فِى<br>\
↓ سِرْبِهِ, meaning, (tropical:)  in respect of his wives, or<br>\
women under covert, and his household, or<br>\
family; a metaphorical sense, from the سِرْب of<br>\
gazelles &amp;c. (A, and so in the Fáïk. [See also<br>\
سِرْبٌ.]) Hence also the saying, إِذَا كَان مُخَلَّى<br>\
السَّرْبِ, meaning When he is made to be in ample<br>\
circumstances; not straitened. (Mgh.) And you<br>\
say وَاسِعُ السَّرْبِ, instead of السِّرْبِ; meaning<br>\
Whose way that he pursues is ample. (TA.<br>\
[But see what follows.])<br>\
-A3-  Also The bosom, or<br>\
breast; or the mind; syn. صَدْرٌ. (Mbr, M, K.) إِنَّهُ<br>\
لَوَاسِعُ السَّرْبِ means Verily he is of ample bosom,<br>\
or mind; and judgment; and love: (M, TA:)<br>\
or, as some say, ample of bosom, or mind; slow<br>\
of anger. (M. [The latter meaning is assigned<br>\
in the Msb and TA to وَاسِعُ السِرْبِ: see the next<br>\
paragraph.])<br>\
سِرْبٌ: see سَارِبٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] A قَطِيع,<br>\
(S, M, K,) or جَمَاعَة, (Mgh, Msb,) [i. e. herd,]<br>\
of gazelles, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) and of<br>\
oxen, (M, Mgh, Msb,) [app. meaning wild oxen,]<br>\
and of [wild] asses, (M,) and of wild animals [in<br>\
general], (S, Msb,) and [a flock or herd] of sheep<br>\
or goats, (M,) and [a flock] of the birds called<br>\
قَطًا, (S, Msb,) and of birds [in general], (M,)<br>\
and [a party, or bevy,] of women, (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K,) &amp;c.; (K;) and, as used by El-&#39; Ajjáj, it is of<br>\
men also: (Sh, TA:) and a poet of the Jinn, as<br>\
they assert, used it metaphorically in speaking of<br>\
a سِرْب of the [lizards called] عَظَآء: (M:) it signifies also (assumed tropical:)  a collection of palm-trees; (M, K; in<br>\
some copies of the latter of which النَّحْل is erroneously put for النَّخْل; TA;) so says AHn; and<br>\
Abu-l-Hasan thinks it to be by way of comparison: and ↓ سُرْبَةٌ is like it [in its meanings]:<br>\
(M: [particularly mentioned in the K as used in<br>\
the last of the senses above mentioned:]) each of<br>\
these words is said to be applied to a قطيع of the<br>\
birds called قَطًا, and of gazelles, and of sheep or<br>\
goats, on the authority of As; and the latter [or<br>\
each] of them is applied to a قطيع of women as<br>\
being likened to gazelles: (TA:) the pl. of the<br>\
former is أَسْرَابٌ; (Sh, M, Msb, TA;) and of ↓ the<br>\
latter, سُرُبٌ, (K, accord. to the TA,) with two<br>\
dammehs, (TA,) [in the CK سُرُوبٌ,] or سُرْبٌ,<br>\
(so in my MS. copy of the K, [either a contraction of the former pl. or a coll. gen. n. of<br>\
which سُرْبَةٌ is the n. un.,]) or both. (TA. [See<br>\
also سُرْبَةٌ below, where the pl. is said to be سُرَبٌ.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, as some explain them, two phrases<br>\
mentioned below in this paragraph.] ―<br>\
-b4-  See also<br>\
سَرْبٌ, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-  It is also syn. with سَرْبٌ<br>\
as meaning A way, or road: and a course: see<br>\
سَرْبٌ in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q. بَالٌ [app. as syn.<br>\
with حَالٌ, i. e. State, or condition]. (S, Msb,<br>\
K.) One says, فُلَانٌ وَاسِعُ السِّرْبِ, meaning رَخِىُّ<br>\
البَالِ [i. e. Such a one is in an ample, or unstraitened,<br>\
state or condition: or the meaning may be, such<br>\
a one is easy, or unstraitened, in mind: see what<br>\
follows, and see also بَالٌ]: (S, Msb:) or, as some<br>\
say, ample of bosom, or mind; slow of anger:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) [see also وَاسِعُ السَّرْبِ, in two places<br>\
near the end of the next preceding paragraph:]<br>\
MF thinks that for بَال we should read مَال,<br>\
agreeably with an explanation of a phrase in<br>\
what here follows. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The قَلْب<br>\
[meaning heart, or mind]: (M, K:) and the<br>\
نَفْس [meaning self]. (IAar, M, Msb, K.) One<br>\
says, هُوَ آمِنٌ فِى سِرْبِهِ He is secure in, or in<br>\
respect of, his heart, or mind: or, himself: (M:)<br>\
but IDrd disallows this latter explanation; and<br>\
says that the meaning is, his family, and his مَال<br>\
[or camels, or cattle, or other property], and his,<br>\
children; as though the phrase آمن فى سربه<br>\
were originally used in relation to the pastor,<br>\
and the stallion [camel], and then extended<br>\
in its relation to others, metaphorically: (TA:)<br>\
or the meaning is [simply], his مَال: or, his<br>\
people, or party: (M, TA:) or as expl. above,<br>\
voce سَرْبٌ, q. v.: or, accord. to Kz, his way.<br>\
(TA.) The pl. is سِرَابٌ. (El-Hejeree, M, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also مَسْرُبَةٌ.<br>\
سَرَب A subterranean excavation: (M, K:) or<br>\
a habitation (S, Mgh, Msb, TA) of a wild animal, (S, * Msb,) in, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or beneath,<br>\
(TA,) the earth, or ground, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,)<br>\
having no passage through it; also called وَكْرٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) such as has a passage through it is<br>\
termed نَفَقٌ: (Mgh, Msb:) the burrow, or hole,<br>\
(M, K,) of a wild animal, (K,) or of a fox, and<br>\
likewise [the den] of a lion, and of a hyena, and<br>\
of a wolf; and the place into which a wild<br>\
animal enters: (M:) pl. أَسْرَابٌ. (M, A, Msb.)<br>\
In the saying in the Kur [xviii. 60], فَاتَّخَذَ<br>\
سَبِيلَهُ فِى الْبَحْرِ سَرَبًا [And it (the fish) took its<br>\
way into the sea &amp;c.], Fr says that when the fish<br>\
was restored to life by the water that came upon<br>\
it from the fountain [of life], and fell into the sea,<br>\
its way became congealed, and like a سَرَب [or<br>\
subterranean excavation, &amp;c.]: Zj says that سربا<br>\
may be considered as put in the accus. case in<br>\
two ways; either as a second objective complement of the verb, or as an inf. n. [of ↓ سَرِبَ,<br>\
q. v.]: and AHát thinks that it here means ذَهَابًا<br>\
[going away]: or, accord. to IAth, سَرَبٌ signifies<br>\
a secret, or hidden, place of passage: or, as used<br>\
by El-Moatarid Edh-Dhafaree, it means [simply]<br>\
a road, or way. (TA.) It signifies also A subterranean channel or conduit, by which water<br>\
enters a حَائِط [or garden, or walled garden of<br>\
palm-trees]. (M, K.) And طَرِيقٌ سَرَبٌ means<br>\
A way, or road, in which people follow one<br>\
another continuously. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Flowing<br>\
water: (M, K: [see also سَرِبٌ:]) or water flowing<br>\
from a مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag] and the<br>\
like: (S:) or water dropping from the punctures<br>\
made in the sewing of a water-skin. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
Water that is poured into a قِرْبَة [or skin for<br>\
water or milk], (M, K,) when it is new, or into<br>\
a مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag], (M,) in order<br>\
that the thong [with which it is sewed] may<br>\
become moistened, (M, K,) so as to swell, and fill<br>\
up the holes made in the sewing. (M.)<br>\
سَرِبٌ Flowing water. (S, * M. [See also سَرَبٌ.])<br>\
You say also مَزَادَةٌ سَرِبَةٌ, i. e. [A leathern-water-bag] flowing. (S, K.)<br>\
سَرْبَةٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  I. q. خَرْزَةٌ<br>\
[A single puncture, or stitch-hole, made in sewing<br>\
a skin or the like]. (K. [There expressly said<br>\
to be, in this sense, with fet-h; but I think that<br>\
we should read سُرْبَةٌ, and خُرْزَةٌ: see, again, the<br>\
next paragraph.])<br>\
سُرْبَةٌ A short journey; (IAar, M;) or so<br>\
↓ سَرْبَةٌ. (K. [But I think that the former is the<br>\
right.]) You say, إِنَّكَ لَتُرِيدُ سُرْبَةً Verily thou<br>\
desirest a short journey. (IAar, M.) A long<br>\
journey is termed سُبْأَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. مَذْهَبٌ<br>\
(S, M, A, K) and طَرِيقَةٌ (A, K) [i. e. A way by<br>\
which one goes or goes away, a proper meaning<br>\
of the former word; and a way, course, mode, or<br>\
manner, of acting or conduct or the like, which<br>\
is a meaning of both of these words]. One says,<br>\
فُلَانٌ بَعِيدُ السُّرْبَةِ, (S, A, TA,) meaning [Such a<br>\
one is] one who takes a distant way into the<br>\
country, or land: (TA:) or meaning بَعِيدُ المَذْهَبِ<br>\
(S, A) and الطَّرِيقَةِ (A) [i. e., who follows a distant, or remote, way in journeying, and a long<br>\
way, course, mode, or manner, of acting or conduct or the like. See also سَرْبٌ, and مَسْرَبٌ].<br>\
Esh-Shenfarà says,<br>\
عَدَوْنَا مِنَ الوَادِى الَّذِى بَيْنَ مِشْعَلٍ<br>\
وَبَيْنَ الحَشَا هَيْهَاتَ أَنْسَأْتُ سُرْبَتِى<br>\
[We passed from the valley that is between<br>\
Mish&#39; al and El-Hashà: distant was it: I made<br>\
my way to lead me far off]; meaning, how<br>\
distant was the place from which I commenced<br>\
my journey! (TA.) And one says also, إِنَّهُ<br>\
لَقَرِيبُ السُّرْبَةِ, meaning قَرِيبُ المَذْهَبِ [i. e. Verily<br>\
he is one who pursues a near way]; who hastens,<br>\
or is quick, in accomplishing his want. (Th, M.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A portion, or detached number, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) of what compose a سِرْب, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
i. e., of a collection [or herd] of gazelles, and of<br>\
[wild] oxen, (Mgh,) or [of a flock] of the birds<br>\
called قَطًا, and of horses, and asses, and gazelles:<br>\
(S:) pl. سُرَبٌ, like غُرَفٌ pl. of غُرْفَةٌ. (Msb.) See<br>\
also سِرْبٌ, in two places; in the latter of which<br>\
the pl. is said to be سُرُبٌ and سُرْبٌ. ―<br>\

twenty to thirty, (M, K,) or from ten to twenty.<br>\

lowering everything so that it becomes [as though<br>\
it were] cleaving to the ground, having no شَخْص;<br>\
(TA;) whereas the آل is that which is in the<br>\
ضُحَى [or early part of the day when the sun is<br>\
yet low], raising figures seen from a distance, and<br>\
making them to quiver: (M:) [several other<br>\
distinctions between the سراب and the آل, mentioned here in the TA, see voce آلٌ:] سَرَابٌ has<br>\
no pl. (S and K voce نَهَارٌ.) One says أَخْدَعُ<br>\
مِنْ سَرَابٍ [More deceitful than a middaymirage]. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  سَرَابِ, like قَطَامِ, (A, K, TA,)<br>\
i. e. indecl., with kesr for its termination, as also<br>\
سَرَابُ, imperfectly decl., (TA,) determinate, (K,<br>\
TA,) as a proper name, not having the article ال<br>\
prefixed to it, (TA,) is the name of The she-camel of El-Basoos (البَسُوس), (K,) or the she-camel El-Basoos, (A, TA,) for El-Basoos was<br>\
her surname: (TA:) whence the saying أَشْأَمُ مِنْ<br>\
سَرَابِ [More inauspicious than Sarábi]: (A, K,<br>\
TA:) a celebrated prov.: for she was the cause of<br>\
a famous war. (TA.)<br>\
سَرُوبٌ [Wont to go away at random]: see 1,<br>\
near the beginning of the paragraph.<br>\
سَرِيبَةٌ A sheep, or goat, (شَاةٌ,) which one drives<br>\
back, or brings back, from the water, when the<br>\
sheep, or goats, are satisfied with drinking, and<br>\
which they follow. (M, TA. [See also شَرِيبَةٌ.])<br>\
سَارِبٌ Going forth: and going away; as also<br>\
↓ سِرْبٌ; the latter expl. by IAar as syn. with<br>\
ذَاهِبٌ and مَاضٍ: (M: [in one place in the TA<br>\
the latter is erroneously written سيرب:]) or going<br>\
away at random into the country, or in the land.<br>\
(S, K.) See also سَرْبٌ, first sentence. You say<br>\
مَالٌ سَارِبٌ, (A,) and فَحْلٌ سَارِبٌ, (TA,) i. e.<br>\
[Camels, or cattle, and a stallion-camel,] repairing<br>\
to the place of pasture: (A, TA:) and ظَيْبَةٌ سَارِبٌ<br>\
(M) or سَارِبَةٌ (TA) [a she-gazelle] going away in<br>\
her place of pasture. (M, TA.) A poet says,<br>\
(S, M,) namely, El-Akhnas Ibn-Shiháb ElTeghlibee, (TA,)<br>\
وَكُلُّ أُنَاسٍ قَارَبُوا قَيْدَ فَحْلِهِمْ<br>\
وَنَحْنُ خَلَعْنَا قَيْدَهُ فَهُوَ سَارِبُ<br>\
[And all other men have contracted the shackles<br>\
of their stallion-camel; but we have pulled off his<br>\
shackles, and he is going away whithersoever he<br>\
will in his place of pasture]: (S, M, TA: but in<br>\
the last, حَلَلْنَا is put in the place of خَلَعْنَا: [in<br>\
the Ham (p. 347) it begins thus: أَرَى كُلَّ قَوْمٍ:])<br>\
this, says As, is a prov.; meaning [other] men<br>\
have abode in one place, not daring to remove to<br>\
another, and have contracted the shackles of their<br>\
stallion, that is, confined him, that he may not<br>\
advance, and be followed by their [other] camels;<br>\
fearing a hostile attack upon them: but we are<br>\
people of might, wandering about the land, and<br>\
going whithersoever we will; and we have pulled<br>\
off the shackles of our stallion, that he may go<br>\
whither he will; and whithersoever he hastes<br>\
away to herbage produced by the rain, thither we<br>\
follow him: (IB, TA:) or it may be that by the<br>\
فحل he means the chief, whom, Abu-l-&#39;Alà says,<br>\
he likens to the stallion-camel. (Ham p. 347.)<br>\
And hence the saying in the Kur [xiii. 11],<br>\
مُسْتَخْفٍ بِاللَّيْلِ وَسَارِبٌ بِالنَّهَارِ, (S, M, TA,) i. e.<br>\
[Hiding himself by night, and] appearing by<br>\
day: (S:) or appearing by day in his way, or<br>\
road, or in the roads: or, as is related on the<br>\
authority of Akh, appearing by night, and hiding<br>\
himself by day; and Ktr says the same of سارب.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
أُسْرُبٌ, (M, K,) and أُسْرُبٌّ, (M, Msb, K,) the<br>\
former mentioned by Sh, (TA,) [the latter the<br>\
more common,] a Pers. word, (M, TA,) arabicized, (Msb, TA,) originally أُسْرُبْ, (M,) [or<br>\
أُسْرُپْ,] or أُسْرُفْ, (Msb, MF, TA,) [and in the<br>\
TA سترب,] i. q. رَصَاصٌ [i. e. Lead], (M, Msb,)<br>\
or آنُكٌ [which signifies the same, or black lead,<br>\
or tin, or pewter]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And the latter, The<br>\
fume of [molten] silver. (M. [See 1, last<br>\
sentence.])<br>\
مَسْرَبٌ A way by which one goes; [like سَرْبٌ<br>\
and سُرْبَةٌ;] syn. مَذْهَبٌ: (Har p. 448:) a place in<br>\
which the مَال [i. e. camels, or cattle,] go to<br>\
pasture (تَسْرُبُ); (Ham p. 99;) and ↓ مَسْرَبَةٌ signifies [the same, or] a place of pasture: (S, K:)<br>\
pl. of the former مَسَارِبُ, (Ham ubi suprà,) and<br>\
so of the latter. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A channel of<br>\
water. (A, and Har ubi suprà.) [Hence,] one<br>\
says, اِخْضَلَّتْ مَسَارِبُ عَيْنَيْهِ i. e. (tropical:)  The channels of<br>\
the tears [of his eyes became moist so as to scatter<br>\
drops]. (A.)<br>\
مَسْرَبَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also The passage, and place of exit, of the dung;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, TA;) in this sense with fet-h (Mgh,<br>\
Msb) only [i. e. to the ر]; or so and likewise<br>\
↓ مَسْرُبَةٌ: and both signify the upper part of the<br>\
anus. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also the next following paragraph. ―<br>\
-b4-  Also [A sitting-place] like a صُفَّة<br>\
[q. v.], before a [chamber such as is called] غُرْفَة:<br>\
not مشربة; for this is a غُرْفَة [itself]. (TA.)<br>\
مَسْرُبَةٌ, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) with damm<br>\
to the ر, (S, Mgh, Msb,) and ↓ مَسْرَبَةٌ, (M, Msb,)<br>\

ex. in a verse cited voce جِذْمٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  The مَسَارِب of<br>\
beasts are The soft parts of their bellies: (M,<br>\
TA:) or the مسربة of any beast means the upper<br>\
