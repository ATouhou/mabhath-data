(MF,) An awning extended over the interior<br>\
court of a house: (S, O, Msb, K:) [and the cover<br>\
of a tent:] and any tent of cotton: (S, O, K,<br>\
and mentioned in the Msb as on the authority of<br>\
J:) or a [ tent of the kind called] فُسْطَاط; (Bd<br>\
in xviii. 28;) so says AO: (Msb:) also (Msb)<br>\
an enclosure around a خَيْمَة [or tent], consisting<br>\
of pieces of cloth, without a roof: (Mgh, Msb:)<br>\
or an enclosure (حُجْرَة) around a فُسْطَاط: (Ksh<br>\
and Bd ubi suprá:) or what surrounds the [tent<br>\
called] خَيْمَة and the [tent called] قُبَّة: (Ham<br>\
p. 772:) or any wall or enclosure, or [tent such<br>\
as is called] مِضْرَب or [such as is called] خِبَآء<br>\
that surrounds a thing: (IAth, TA:) pl. سُرَادِقَاتٌ:<br>\
(S O, K:) it has this pl., though it is masc.,<br>\
because. it has no broken pl. (Sb, TA.) ElKedhdháb El-Hirmázee says, not Ru-beh as in the<br>\
“ Book ” of Sb [and in the S], addressing Hakam<br>\
Ibn-El-Mundhir Ibn-El-Járood,<br>\

-b3-  And<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Smoke rising high, and surrounding a thing.<br>\

to what will surround the unbelievers, of the fire<br>\
of Hell, (Ksh, Bd,) as being likened to a فُسْطَاط,<br>\
(Bd,) or to an enclosure around a فسطاط; or as<br>\

having the whole of its upper part, and of its<br>\
lower part, مَشْدُود [accord. to the TK here meaning curtained, which seems to be the only apposite rendering, but I know not any authority<br>\
for it], (Lth, JK, O, K, TA,) or مَسْدُود [i. e.<br>\
closed, &amp;c.]. (So in the CK.)<br>\
