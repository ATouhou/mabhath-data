سَقَرُ Hell: (S, K:) one of the [proper] names<br>\
thereof: (S:) Aboo-Bekr says, There are two<br>\
opinions respecting this word: some say, that<br>\
the fire of the world to come is thus called,<br>\
and that the derivation of the word is unknown,<br>\
and that it is imperfectly decl. because it is determinate and a foreign word: others say that it<br>\
is from سَقَرَتْهُ الضْلَرRَّمْسُ, because it melts the bodies<br>\
and souls, and that it is an Arabic word; and he<br>\
who holds it to be such says that it is imperfectly<br>\
decl. because it is determinate and of the fem.<br>\
gender. (TA.)<br>\
سَقَرَاتٌ The vehemence of the stroke of the<br>\
sun. (S.)<br>\
مُسْمَقِرُّ A day vehemently hot. (S in this art.,<br>\
