locust, (S, K,) and of the female of the [lizard<br>\
called] ضَبّ, (TA,) [and of a fish, and the like,<br>\
(see سَرْءٌ,)] She laid eggs: (S, K, TA:) and سَرَتْ,<br>\
inf. n. سَرْوٌ, is a dial. var. thereof. (TA in art.<br>\
سرو.) [And accord. to El-Kanánee, as cited in<br>\
the TA, it seems that one says also, of locusts<br>\
(جَرَاد), سَرَأَ البَيْضَ and سَرَأَ بِهِ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, each of<br>\
these two verbs, (K,) the former mentioned by<br>\

the like, (see سَرْءٌ,)] She attained the period of<br>\
laying eggs. (S, K.)<br>\
سَرْءٌ and ↓ سَرْأَةٌ (M, K) and ↓ سِرْأَةٌ (K [for ويُكسر<br>\
in the CK should be وَتُكْسَرُ, referring to the second<br>\
form,]) and ↓ سِرْءٌ, (TA, [accord. to which وتكسر<br>\
refers to the س in the first and second, but this<br>\
I think improbable,]) or سرأة is with kesr [only,<br>\
i. e. ↓ سِرْأَةٌ], (S, K, [supposing that in the latter the<br>\
pronoun هِىَ refers to سرأة, but accord. to the<br>\
TA it means الكَلِمَةُ, so as to refer to سرء also,])<br>\
and most hold this to be correct, (TA,) The egg,<br>\
(S, K,) or eggs, (M,) of the locust, (S, M, K,) and<br>\
of the [lizard called] ضَبّ, (M, TA,) and of fish<br>\
(M, K, TA) and the like; (M, TA;) and سِرْوَةٌ<br>\
signifies the same, but is originally with ء: (S:)<br>\
accord. to &#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh El-Isbahánee,<br>\
↓ سِرْأَةٌ and سِرْوَةٌ signify the eggs of the locust;<br>\
but some say, only when laid: accord. to Lth,<br>\
سرء [app. سَرْءٌ] signifies the eggs of the fish and the<br>\
like, as also سُرُوْءٌ; [the former as a coll. gen. n.,<br>\
and the latter as its pl., agreeably with analogy;]<br>\
and one is called سرأة [app. ↓ سَرْأَةٌ as a n. un.,<br>\
agreeably with analogy; or it may be ↓ سِرْأَةٌ].<br>\

A dust-coloured arrow: in this sense like wise<br>\
