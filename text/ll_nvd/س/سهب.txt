سَهَبَ, inf. n. سَهْبٌ, He took the<br>\
thing. (TK.)<br>\
2<br>\
تَسْهِيبٌ The departure of reason, or intellect:<br>\
its verb [which was probably سُهِّبَ, like أُسْهِبَ,<br>\
q. v.,] is obsolete. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسهب He went far, or to a great or an<br>\
extraordinary length, in a thing; for instance, in<br>\
journeying; as in a trad., in which it is said of<br>\
horses, or horsemen, أَسْبَهَتْ شَهْرًا They went far<br>\
for a month; and in eating and drinking; as in<br>\
another trad.: (TA:) it is from سُهْبٌ, signifying<br>\
“ a plain and far-extending land; ” as though<br>\
meaning He traversed a plain and far-extending<br>\
tract of land; like as one says أَسْهَلَ and أَحْزَنَ.<br>\
(Har p. 572.) He (a horse) ran with wide steps,<br>\
and preceded, or outstripped. (S, TA. [See also<br>\
سَهْبٌ, below.]) And [hence,] He was, or became,<br>\
loquacious, or profuse of speech; (IAar, S, K;)<br>\
like اسهم; (K * and TA in art. سهم;) [and] so<br>\
اسهب فِى المَنْطِقِ : (JK:) or he doted; or was<br>\
disordered in his intellect; but when a man<br>\
makes many mistakes in his speech, you say of<br>\
him أَفْنَدَ: (As, TA:) or he doted much, or<br>\
often; or was much, or often, disordered in his<br>\
intellect: (AO, TA:) [and it seems from an explanation of the part. n. مُسْهِبٌ that it probably<br>\
signifies also he was eloquent, or profuse of correct speech:] or he was very greedy, and (in<br>\
some copies of the K “ or ”) covetous, so as to<br>\
refrain from nothing: (K, TA:) and you say<br>\
also اسهب كَلَامَهُ He prolonged, or was prolix<br>\
in, his speech: and فى كَلَامِهِ إِسْهَابٌ In his<br>\
speech is prolixity. (A, TA.) Also He (a man)<br>\
gave much, or largely; and so ↓ استهب: (Lth,<br>\
K:) [or, in this sense,] you say, اسهب فِى العَطَآء.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اسهبوا They reached sand, in digging [a<br>\
well], and water came not forth: (S:) or they<br>\
dug, and came upon sand or a current of air:<br>\
(K:) or they dug, and came upon a current of<br>\
air, and the water disappointed them of its<br>\
coming: (Az, TA:) or they dug without attaining any good: (K:) or اسهب signifies he dug<br>\
until he reached sand: and, accord. to Th, he dug<br>\
a well and reached water. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اسهبوا الدَّابَّةَ<br>\

(a man, S) lost his reason, (S, K, TA,) as some<br>\
say, (TA,) from the bite of a serpent, (S, K, TA,)<br>\
or the sting of a scorpion: (TA:) or his colour<br>\
became altered in consequence of love or fright or<br>\
disease: (K:) or, accord. to AHát, اسهب, [so in<br>\
the TA, in which it seems to be implied that<br>\
أَسْهَبَ, not أُسْهِبَ, is meant,] inf. n. إِسْهَابٌ, signifies he (a man bitten by a serpent, or stung by a<br>\
scorpion,) lost his reason and lived. (TA. [See<br>\
also the part. n., مُسْهَبٌ, below.]) إِسْهَابُ اللُّبِّ<br>\
[in which the former word is probably the inf. n.<br>\
of أُسْهِبَ, not of أَسْهَبَ,] means The mind&#39;s being<br>\
confounded, or perplexed, by [love of] a woman.<br>\
(JK.)<br>\

(TA) vehement therein, (JK, K, * TA,) slow to<br>\

(K,) but the latter of these is said to be peculiarly<br>\
the chaste form in this sense, (TA,) signify the<br>\
same. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بِئْرٌ سَهْبَةٌ A deep well; (S, A, O,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ بِئْرٌ مُسْهَبَةٌ: (S * O:) or the former,<br>\
a deep well (JK, TA) from which sand comes<br>\
forth (JK) or from which wind, or a current of<br>\
air, comes forth: (TA:) and ↓ the latter, a well<br>\
of which the coarse sand baffles one so that he<br>\
cannot reach the water [in digging it]; (K;) or<br>\
a well that people dig until they reach pouring<br>\
earth, which baffles them by its pouring down, so<br>\
that they leave it; (Sh, TA;) or a well of which<br>\
the bottom and the water are not reached; (Ks,<br>\
TA;) or a well that is dug until one reaches the<br>\

pl. signifies plain and far-extending tracts of<br>\

the sing. is expl. in the TA in one place as signifying a wide land)]: (AA, TA:) or سُهُوبُ الفَلَاةِ<br>\
signifies, (K,) or signifies also, (JK,) tracts, or<br>\
regions, of the فلاة [i. e. desert, or waterless<br>\
desert,] in which there is no way. (JK, K.) [See<br>\
an ex. in a verse cited in art. رقل, conj. 4: and<br>\
see also سَهْبٌ, above, first sentence.]<br>\
مُسْهَبٌ, with fet-h to the ه, [contr. to rule, being<br>\
of the measure مُفْعَلٌ in the sense of the measure<br>\
مُفْعِلٌ,] Going far, or to a great or an extraordinary length, in a thing: and prolonging.<br>\

[with respect to rule], (S, TA,) Loquacious, or<br>\
profuse of speech: (AZ, IAar, ISk, IKt, Zbd, S,<br>\
K, TA:) or, accord. to Aboo-&#39;Alee El-Baghdádee, as is stated by IB, the former signifies<br>\
profuse and erroneous in speech: and the ↓ latter,<br>\
eloquent, or profuse and correct in speech: and<br>\
in like manner says El-Aalam, adding that ↓ the<br>\
latter is shown to have this meaning by its being<br>\
applied to a horse that is fleet, or swift, and excellent: (TA:) or the former signifies doting;<br>\
or disordered in his intellect: (As, TA:) or<br>\
doting much, or often; or much, or often, disordered in his intellect: (AO, TA:) [and similar<br>\
explanations of it will be found below:] other<br>\
instances of verbs of the measure أَفْعَلَ having<br>\
مُفْعَلٌ as the measure of the part. n. used in the<br>\
sense of the measure مُفْعِلٌ are أَلْفَجَ and أَحْصَنَ<br>\
and أَجْرَشَتِ الإِبِلُ and أَهْتَرَ: as used in the first of<br>\
the senses expl. in this sentence, مُسْهَبٌ is from<br>\
سُهْبٌ signifying “ a wide land: ” or, as some say,<br>\
it is from أَسْهَبُوا الدَّابَّةَ, expl. above; as though<br>\
the person to whom it is applied were left to<br>\
speak what he would, or made to have ample<br>\
scope to say what he would. (TA.) ―<br>\

مُسْهَبٌ and ↓ مُسْهِبٌ signify also Very greedy,<br>\
and covetous, so as to refrain from nothing.<br>\

or the sting of a scorpion: or one who talks<br>\
irrationally, or foolishly, or deliriously, in consequence of doting, or disorder of his intellect: or<br>\
whose colour has become altered in consequence of<br>\
love or fright or disease. (TA.) And مُسْهَبُ<br>\
الجِسْمِ A man whose body is wasting away in<br>\
consequence of love: so says Yaakoob: and Lh<br>\
mentions the phrases العَقْلِ ↓ مُسْهِبُ, with kesr,<br>\
and الجِسْمِ, and مُسْهِم, which is formed by substitution [of م for ب], as meaning a man whose<br>\
reason is departing, and whose body is wasting<br>\
away, in consequence of love: and accord, to<br>\
AHát, مسهب, [app. ↓ مُسْهِبٌ, as the context seems<br>\
to imply,] applied to one bitten by a serpent or<br>\
stung by a scorpion, signifies who has lost his<br>\
reason, and lives. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Also Land farextending, and plain, with depression, consisting<br>\
of low tracts, the depression whereof is little,<br>\
extending for the space of a day and a night [of<br>\
journeying], and thereabout: the بُطُون [or low<br>\
tracts] of land of which it consists are in [deserts<br>\
such as are termed] صَحَارَى, and in elevated and<br>\
plain, or hard and elevated, tracts of ground,<br>\
and sometimes they flow [with torrents], and<br>\
sometimes they do not flow, for they comprise<br>\
parts that are rugged, and parts that are plain,<br>\
or soft, producing much herbage, and in them<br>\
are places wherein are trees [or shrubs], and<br>\
places wherein are none. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Also A<br>\
place that does not obstruct nor retain water.<br>\
