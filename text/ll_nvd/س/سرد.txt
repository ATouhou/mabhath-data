this measure: (TA:) [but several others should<br>\
be added; as اِعْلَنْدَى and اِكْلَنْدَى and اِغْلَنْتَى:]<br>\

the fabrication of the coats of mail: (Bd, Jel:)<br>\
or and do thou properly adapt the nails, or pins,<br>\
and the holes of the rings, [in the fabrication,]<br>\
not making the former thick and the latter small,<br>\
nor the reverse: (M, Bd, * L:) or السَّرْد means<br>\
السَّمْر [i. e. the nailing, or the making firm, or<br>\
fast, with nails], (Zj, M, L,) in this instance.<br>\
(Zj, L.)<br>\
-A2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Coats of mail; (S, M, L, K;)<br>\
a gen. n. in this sense: (S, K:) [and a single<br>\
coat of mail; like زَرْدٌ and زَرَدٌ:] and (tropical:)  any other<br>\
حَلَق [properly signifying rings, but here meaning<br>\
mail]; (S, A, K;) [i. e.] it signifies also the like<br>\
of coats of mail, made of حَلَق: (M, L:) [said to<br>\
be] so called because the two extremities of each<br>\
ring are perforated by the nail, or pin; and these<br>\
rings are [termed] ↓ المُسْرَدُ: (L:) [if so, the word<br>\
is an inf. n. used in the sense of a pass. part. n.,]<br>\
see مَسْرُودٌ, [and then as a subst.; and, being<br>\
originally an inf. n., it is used alike as sing. and<br>\
pl.; or, as Z says,] it is an inf. n. used as a subst.:<br>\
(A:) or السَّرْدُ, as some say, means السَّمْرُ, [as<br>\
mentioned above,] and ↓ السَّرَدُ means الحَلَقُ [like<br>\
الزَّرَدُ]. (M.)<br>\
-A3-  Also (tropical:)  Consecutive, or following<br>\
one another: so in the phrase نُجُومٌ سَرْدٌ (tropical:)  [Stars<br>\
that are consecutive: the epithet retaining the<br>\
masc. sing. form, though applied to a pl. subst.,<br>\
because originally an inf. n.; like عَدْلٌ in the<br>\
phrase رِجَالٌ عَدْلٌ]. (A.) So too as an epithet<br>\
applied to three of the sacred months, in the saying, ثَلَاثَةٌ سَرْدٌ وَوَاحِدٌ فَرْدٌ [Three are consecutive<br>\
and one is separate]: (A:) thus an Arab of the<br>\
desert answered when asked if he knew the sacred<br>\
months: (S, M, Msb:) the سرد are Dhu-l-Kaadeh<br>\
and Dhu-l-Hijjeh and El-Moharram, and the فرد<br>\
is Rejeb. (S, M.)<br>\
سَرَدٌ: see السَّرَدُ in the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
سَرَادٌ Hard green dates: (K:) and dates that<br>\
are injured by want of water, (K, TA,) and<br>\
consequently dry up before ripening: (TA:) or<br>\
unripe dates that drop before attaining to maturity, while green: n. un. with ة: (AHn, M, TA:)<br>\
or the latter signifies a date that becomes sweet<br>\
before it becomes coloured, being such as is termed<br>\
a بَلَحَة. (M, TA.) [See بُسْرٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  See also مِسْرَدٌ.<br>\
-A3-  [سَرَادٌ and سُرُودٌ said by Golius, and by Freytag after him, to signify the same as the “ Pers.<br>\
رَمِيدَنْ Pavidum fugacemque esse,” as on the<br>\
authority of the KL, are mistranscriptions for<br>\
شِرَادٌ and شُرُودٌ, which I find thus expl. in the<br>\
KL.]<br>\
سِرَادٌ: see مِسْرَدٌ<br>\
سَرِيدٌ: see مِسْرَدٌ in two places.<br>\
سِرَادَةٌ The art of fabricating coats of mail; as<br>\
also زِرَادَةٌ. (TA in art. زرد.)<br>\
سَرَّادٌ A fabricator of coats of mail; (TA in<br>\
art. زرد;) i. q. زَرَّادٌ. (M and TA in art. زرد.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And A sewer of leather; (TA;) as also ↓ سَارِدٌ.<br>\
(AA, L, TA.)<br>\
سَرْمَدٌ: and سَرْمَدِىٌّ: see art. سرمد.<br>\
سَرَنْدًى Strong: (S, M, K:) or bold, daring,<br>\
brave, or courageous: (M:) and quick in his<br>\
affairs: (K:) or a man who goes on, or advances,<br>\
boldly; derived from السَّرْدُ: (Sb, TA:) [accord.<br>\
to Sb, therefore, this is its proper art; but<br>\
accord. to the K, its proper art. is سرند, in which<br>\
F mentions it again: it is perfectly decl., i. e.,<br>\
with tenween, for] the fem, is سَرَنْدَاةٌ. (S, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also A sword that penetrates the thing that<br>\
it strikes. (L.)<br>\
سَارِدٌ: see سَرَّادٌ.<br>\
المُسْرَدُ: see سَرْدٌ.<br>\
مِسْرَدٌ (S, M, A, L, Msb) and ↓ سِرَادٌ (S, M, A,<br>\
L) An instrument for perforating: (M, L,<br>\
Msb:) and, (M,) or as some say, (Msb,) an<br>\
instrument with which leather is sewed; (S;)<br>\
syn. مِخْرَزٌ; (M, L, Msb;) or إِشْفًى; which is<br>\
[said to be] the same thing as the مِخْرَز; (L;) as<br>\
also ↓ سَرِيدٌ: (K:) or an [instrument of the kind<br>\
called] إِشْفًى that has a hole at its extremity;<br>\
(A;) and so ↓ سَرِيدٌ and ↓ سَرَادٌ. (TA: [but the<br>\
last I think a mistake for سِرَاد.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
one says, هُوَ ابْنُ مِسْرَدٍ, (K,) or هُوَ ابْنُ أُمِّ مِسْرَدٍ,<br>\
(A,) (tropical:)  He is the son of a female slave: (A, K:)<br>\
because she is a sewer of skins, or leather: (A:)<br>\
an expression of vituperation. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,<br>\
likewise,] مِسْرَدٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The tongue. (M,<br>\
A.) So in the saying, فُلَانٌ يَخْرِقُ الأَعْرَاضَ بِمِسْرَدِهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Such a one wounds reputations with his tongue].<br>\
(A.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A sandal having its لِسَان [or<br>\
tongue, i. e. the thing projecting in its fore part,]<br>\
faced with another piece sewed on. (M, L.)<br>\
مُسَرَّدٌ; and its fem., with ة: see the next paragraph, in three places.<br>\
خَرْزٌ مَسْرُودٌ and ↓ مُسَرَّدٌ [app. A sewing of<br>\
leather or skin carried on in regular and uninterrupted order]. (S. [In one of my copies of<br>\
the S, I find خَرَز in the place of خَرْز; and so in<br>\
the L; but the latter appears from the context to<br>\
be the right reading.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And likewise دِرْعٌ<br>\
مَسْرُودَةٌ and ↓ مُسَرَّدَةٌ, (S,) or دِرْعٌ مَسْرُودٌ, and<br>\
↓ لَبُوسٌ مُسَرَّدٌ, [though دِرْعٌ and لَبُوسٌ are both<br>\
generally fem.,] and ↓ لَأْمَةٌ سَرْدٌ, [in which the<br>\
epithet retains the masc. form because originally<br>\
an inf. n., like عَدْلٌ in the phrase اِمْرَأَةٌ عَدْلٌ,] A<br>\
coat of mail fabricated by inserting the rings one<br>\
into another. (A.) And مَسْرُودَةٌ signifies A coat<br>\
of mail (دِرْعٌ) perforated [in its rings]. (S.)<br>\
لُؤْلُؤٌ مُتَسَرِّدٌ (tropical:)  Pearls following one another, or<br>\
doing so uninterruptedly. (A.) And مَاشٍ مُتَسَرِّدٌ<br>\
