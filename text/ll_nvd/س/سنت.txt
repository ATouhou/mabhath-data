perseverance, or time after time. (M, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسنتوا They experienced drought, or barrenness: (S, M, A, K:) derived from سَنَةٌ; the و<br>\
being changed into ت, [for سَنَةٌ is originally<br>\
سَنْوَةٌ, or, accord. to one dial. سَنْهَةٌ,] to distinguish<br>\
between this verb and أَسْنَى as signifying “ he<br>\
remained in a place a year: ” or, as Fr says, they<br>\
imagined the ه [meaning ة, in سَنَةٌ,] to be a<br>\
radical letter, finding it to be the third letter, and<br>\
therefore changed it into ت: (S:) accord. to Sb,<br>\
the ت [in أَسْنَتَ] is substituted for the ى [in<br>\
أَسْنَى]; and there is no instance of the like except<br>\
ثِنْتَانِ [in which the ت is substituted for the final<br>\
radical, ى], (M in the present art.,) and in words<br>\
of the measure اِفْتَعَلَ [as اِتَّسَرَ for اِيتَسَرَ]. (M in<br>\
art. ثنى.)<br>\

تَسَنَّتَهَا [He married her, or took her as his<br>\
wife, he being an ignoble, or a low-born, but rich,<br>\
man, and she being a noble, or high-born, but<br>\
poor, woman; or] he, an ignoble, or a low-born,<br>\
man, married her, a noble, or high-born woman,<br>\
because of the paucity of her property and the<br>\
abundance of his property. (S) And تسنّت<br>\
كَرِيمَةَ آلِ فُلَانٍ He married the noble or highborn, woman of the family of such a one in the<br>\
year of drought, dearth, or scarcity. (TA.)<br>\
أَصَابَهُمْ سَنَتٌ, for سَنَةٌ, Drought, or barrenness,<br>\
