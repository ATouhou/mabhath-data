تَسَرْوَلَ He clad himself, or became clad,<br>\

سَرَاوِيل a Pers. word, (S, * M, Msb, * K,) originally شَلْوَار, (MA, KL, [in the former loosely<br>\
expl. by the word إِزَارٌ, and so in the PS,]) of<br>\
well-known meaning, (S,) [Drawers, trousers, or<br>\
breeches; originally applied to such as are worn<br>\
under other clothing;] a certain under-garment;<br>\
(MA;) [but now applied also to such as are worn<br>\
externally;] is masc. [and perfectly decl., i. e.<br>\
with tenween], and fem. [and imperfectly decl., i. e.<br>\
without tenween]; (S, M, Msb, K; *) sometimes<br>\
masc., (Msb, K,) but not known to As otherwise<br>\
than as fem.; (M;) accord. to the usage most<br>\
commonly obtaining, it is imperfectly decl. and<br>\
fem.: (MF:) Sb says that it is a sing., and is a<br>\
foreign, or Pers., word, arabicized; resembling,<br>\
in their [the Arabs&#39;] language, what is imperfectly decl. [as a pl. of the measure فَعَالِيلُ] when<br>\
determinate and when indeterminate; but is perfectly decl. when indeterminate; and imperfectly<br>\
decl. if applied as a proper name to a man, and<br>\
so is its dim. if so applied, because it is fem. and<br>\
of more than three letters: (S:) or it is imperfectly decl. as a proper name because it is also<br>\
originally a foreign word; and its dim., ↓ سُرَيْيِيل,<br>\
[for سُرَيْوِيل, the و being changed into ى, as in<br>\
سَيِّدٌ for سَيْوِدٌ,] is perfectly decl. unless used as a<br>\
proper name, in which latter case it is imperfectly<br>\
decl. [for the reason above mentioned or] because<br>\
it is fem. and determinate: (IB, TA:) it (i. e.<br>\
سَرَاوِيل) is made, as a pl., imperfectly decl. when<br>\
indeterminate by some of the grammarians; (S;)<br>\
and it occurs in poetry imperfectly decl. [when<br>\
indeterminate]: (S, M, * IB, TA:) [but this may<br>\
be by poetic license:] thus in the saying of Ibn-Mukbil,<br>\
أَتَى دُونَهَا ذَبُّ الرِّيَادِ كَأَنَّهُ<br>\
فَتًى فَارِسِىٌّ سَرَاوِيلَ رَامِحُ<br>\
[The came as an obstacle intervening in the way<br>\
to her, or them, the wild bull, as though he were<br>\
a Persian youth in drawers; one with a pair of<br>\
horns]: (S, * IB, TA:) the former [however] is<br>\
the usual way, [contrary to what has been said<br>\
on the authority of MF,] though the latter is<br>\
more valid: (S:) the pl. is سَرَاوِيلَاتٌ: (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K:) Sb says that it has no broken pl.,<br>\
because, if it had, it would be the same as the<br>\
sing.: (M:) or, (K,) some say, (S, M, Msb,)<br>\
namely those grammarians who make it imperfectly decl. when indeterminate, (S,) holding it<br>\
to be [originally] an Arabic word, (Msb,) it is a<br>\
pl. of which the sing. is ↓ سِرْوَالَةٌ (S, M, Msb, K)<br>\
and ↓ سِرْوَالٌ (S, K) and ↓ سِرْوِيلٌ, which is [said<br>\
to be] the only instance of a word of the measure<br>\
فَعْوِيلٌ: (K:) [this, therefore, confirms the opinion that I hold, that the measure of this word is<br>\
فِعْلِيلٌ, and that all the words of the present art.<br>\
are quadriliteral-radical, agreeably with an assertion in the TA that سرل is not genuine Arabic:<br>\
though it seems that all the lexicographers regard<br>\
the و in the words of this art. as augmentative:]<br>\
a poet says,<br>\
فَلَيْسَ يَرِقُّ لِمُسْتَعْطِفِ * ↓ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ اللُّؤْمِ سِرْوَالَةٌ<br>\
[Upon him is an under-garment of ignobleness,<br>\
(i. e. ignobleness cleaves to him like a pair of<br>\
drawers,) so that he does not become tenderhearted to one who endeavours to conciliate him]:<br>\
(S, * M:) in the “ Mujarrad,” سَرَاوِيلُ is made<br>\
fem., and ↓ سِرْوَالٌ masc.: (Msb:) سَرَاوِين is a<br>\
dial. var.; (K;) or syn. with سَرَاوِيل; the ن in<br>\
the former being asserted by Yaakoob to be a<br>\
substitute for the ل [in the latter]: (M:) and<br>\
شِرْوَالٌ, with ش, is likewise a dial. var. [of سِرْوَالٌ],<br>\
(K,) mentioned by Es-Sijistánee, on the authority of some one or more of the Arabs: (TA:)<br>\
[the common modern pronunciation is شَرْوَال: pl.<br>\
شَرَاوِيل.]<br>\
سُرَيْيِيل: dim. of سَرَاوِيل, q. v. (IB, TA.)<br>\
مُسَرْوَلٌ Clad with سَرَاوِيل; as also ↓ مُتَسَرْوِلٌ.<br>\
(A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] طَائِرٌ مُسَرْوَلٌ (tropical:)  A bird whose<br>\
plumage clothes its legs. (M, L, TA.) And<br>\
حَمَامَةٌ مُسَرْوَلَةٌ (tropical:)  A pigeon having feathers upon<br>\
its legs. (S, K, TA.) And فَرَسٌ مُسَرْوَلٌ, (K,) or<br>\
فَرَسٌ أَبْلَقُ مُسَرْوَلٌ, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, TA,) (tropical:)  [A horse,<br>\
or a black and white horse,] whose whiteness<br>\
of the legs extends (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K) beyond,<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, K, TA,) or to, (S,) the arms and<br>\
thighs: (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K:) or مُسَرْوَلٌ applied to<br>\
a horse means white in the hinder part, [and<br>\
black, or of some other colour, in the hind legs,]<br>\
the whiteness descending to the thighs. (A, voce<br>\
آزَرُ.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And المُسَرْوَلُ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The wild bull:<br>\
because of the blackness that is in his legs. (Az,<br>\
