low, base, &amp;c.: the pl. of ↓ سِفْلَةٌ is سِفَلٌ; (TA;)<br>\
one should not say, ↓ هُوَ سَفِلَةٌ because this is<br>\
[used only as] a pl.: (S:) the vulgar say رَجُلٌ<br>\
مِنْ قَوْمٍ سِفَلٍ ↓ سِفْلَةٌ; (S, Mgh; *) but this has<br>\
been disallowed: (Mgh:) a man is related to<br>\

him سِفْلَةٌ, (TA,) إِنْ كُنْتُ سِفْلَةً فَأَنْتِ طَالِقٌ,<br>\
(Mgh, TA,) meaning If I be low, base, &amp;c., in<br>\
