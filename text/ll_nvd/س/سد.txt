(M, A.) And you say, سَدِّدْ صَاحِبَكَ Teach thou<br>\

a dam: (Msb:) a thing intervening, as a separation,<br>\
a partition, a fence, a barrier, a rampart, or an obstacle, or obstruction, between two other things; (S,<br>\
Msb, K:) and a mountain: (S, M, K: [in the last<br>\
it seems that this meaning is restricted to the former<br>\
word; but if restricted to either, it should be to the<br>\
latter:]) or, as some say, anything that faces one,<br>\
or is over against one, and bars, or excludes, (يَسُدُّ,)<br>\
what is behind it: whence goats are said to be<br>\
سَدٌّ يُرَى مِنْ وَرَائِهِ الفَقْرُ (assumed tropical:)  [a barrier behind which<br>\
is seen poverty]; meaning that they are not of<br>\
great utility: (M:) or سَدٌّ signifies what is made<br>\
by man; and سُدٌّ, what is created by God, (Zj,<br>\
M, Msb, K,) as a mountain: (Msb:) in the<br>\
Kur xviii. 92 and 93, and xxxvi. 8, some read<br>\
with fet-h, and some with damm: (M, TA:) the<br>\
pl. is أَسْدَادٌ, [a pl. of pauc.,] (A, Msb,) or أَسِدَّةٌ,<br>\
[also a pl. of pauc.,] and سُدُودٌ, [a pl. of mult.,]<br>\
the latter of these two agreeable with general<br>\
analogy, and the former of them anomalous, or,<br>\
[ISd says,] in my opinion, this (أَسِدَّةٌ) is pl. of<br>\
سِدَادٌ. (M.) You say, ضُرِبَ بَيْنَهُمَا سَدٌّ and سُدٌّ<br>\
[A barrier, or an obstacle, was set between them<br>\
two]: and ضُرِبَتْ بَيْنَهُمَا الأَسْدَادُ [Barriers, or<br>\
obstacles, were set between them two]. (A.) And<br>\
ضَرَبَتْ عَلَيْهِ الأَرْضُ بِالأَسْدَادِ (tropical:)  [The earth, or land,<br>\
set barriers, or obstacles, against him]; meaning,<br>\
the ways became closed, or stopped, against him,<br>\
and the courses that he should pursue became<br>\
obscure to him: (K: in the CK ضُرِبَتْ:) the<br>\
sing. of أَسْدَادٌ [accord. to general analogy] is<br>\
سُدٌّ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] the former (سَدٌّ) also<br>\
signifies, (Fr, S, M, L, K,) or ↓ سِدَادٌ, (A,) or the<br>\
former and ↓ سَدَادَةٌ, (L,) (tropical:)  A fault, or defect,<br>\
(Fr, S, M, A, &amp;c.,) such as blindness and deafness<br>\
and dumbness, (S,) or such as closes, or stops,<br>\
one&#39;s mouth, so that he does not speak: (A:) pl.<br>\
of the first, (S, M, K,) or of the second, (A,)<br>\
أَسِدَّةٌ, [a pl. of pauc.,] (S, M, A, K,) accord. to<br>\
analogy سُدُودٌ, (S, M, K,) or أَسُدٌّ [which is a pl. of<br>\
pauc.]. (M.) You say, ↓ مَا بِهِ سِدَادٌ (tropical:)  There is<br>\
not in him any fault &amp;c.: and فُلَانٌ بَرِىْءٌ مِنَ<br>\
الأَسِدَّةِ (tropical:)  Such a one is free from faults &amp;c. (A.)<br>\
And تَسُدُّ فَاهُ عَنِ الكَلَامِ ↓ مَا بِفُلَانٍ سَدَادَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  There<br>\
is not in such a one a fault that stops his mouth<br>\
from speaking. (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, L.) And لَا تَجْعَلَنَّ<br>\
بِجَنْبِكَ الأَسِدَّةَ (tropical:)  By no means render thou thy<br>\
bosom contracted so that thou shalt be unable to<br>\
return an answer, like him who is deaf or dumb.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also سُدٌّ. ―<br>\
-b4-  سدّ [so in the TA,<br>\
i. e. either سَدٌّ or سُدَّ,] also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A she-camel by which the sportsman conceals himself<br>\
from the game; also called دَرِيْئَةٌند دَرِيعَةٌ<br>\
whence the saying, رَمَاهُ فِى سدِّ نَاقَتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He shot<br>\
him, or shot at him, by his she-camel whereby he was<br>\
concealing himself]. (IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And سَدٌّ, (M,)<br>\
or سُدٌّ, (O, K,) is also syn. with ظِلٌّ [as meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  Shade, or shadow; or cover, or protection].<br>\
(IAar, M, O, K, TA.) A poet cited by IAar says,<br>\
قَعَدْتُ لَهُ فِى سَدِّ نِقْضٍ مُعَوَّدٍ<br>\
لِذٰلِكَ فِى صَحْرَآءَ جِذْمٍ دَرِينُهَا<br>\
(tropical:)  [I sat for him, i. e. lay in wait for him, in the<br>\
shade, or cover, of a camel rendered lean by travel,<br>\
accustomed to that, in a desert whereof the dry<br>\
herbage was old]: i. e. I made him a cover, or<br>\
screen, to me, in order that he might not see me:<br>\
and by جِذْم he means “ old,” because الجِذْمُ<br>\
signifies الأَصْلُ, and there is nothing older than<br>\
the أَصْل; and he uses it as an epithet because it<br>\
implies the meaning of an epithet. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  سَدٌّ<br>\
also signifies A thing, (S, K,) [i. e.] a [basket such<br>\
as is called] سَلَّة, (M, TA,) made of twigs, (S,<br>\
M, K,) and having covers (أَطْبَاق): (S, K: [but<br>\
this addition in the S and K seems properly to<br>\
apply to the pl., as will be shown by what<br>\
follows:]) pl. سِدَادٌ and سُدُودٌ: (M, TA:) or,<br>\
accord. to Lth, سُدُودٌ signifies [baskets such as are<br>\
called] سِلَال, [pl. of سَلَّةٌ,] made of twigs, and<br>\
having covers (أَطْبَاق); one of which is called [not<br>\
سَدٌّ but] ↓ سَدَّةٌ: and it is said also on other authority that the سَلَّة is called سَدَّةٌ and طَبْلٌ.<br>\
(L, TA.)<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A swarm of locusts obstructing the<br>\

سُدٌّ (tropical:)  locusts (S, M, A, K) that have obstructed,<br>\
(S, K,) or obstructing, (M, A,) the horizon, (S,<br>\
M, A, K,) by their multitude: (S, A, K:) in<br>\
which case, سُدٌّ is either a substitute for جَرَادٌ and<br>\
therefore a substantive, or it is pl. of ↓ سَدُودٌ signifying that which obstructs the horizon and<br>\
therefore an epithet. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A black<br>\
cloud, (AZ, S, K, TA,) that has risen in any<br>\
tract of the sky: (TA:) or a collection of clouds<br>\
rising, obstructing the horizon: (M:) pl. سُدُودٌ:<br>\
(S, M, K:) [or] ↓ سَدٌّ and صَدٌّ, but the former is<br>\
the more approved, signify (assumed tropical:)  a cloud, or collection<br>\
of clouds, rising high, and appearing like a<br>\
mountain. (M and L in art. صد.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A<br>\
valley: (K:) so called because it becomes closed,<br>\
or stopped up. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And A valley containing stones and masses of rock, in which water<br>\
remains for some time, or a long time: pl. سِدَدَةٌ:<br>\
(S, L, K:) or you say, أَرْضٌ بِهَا سِدَدَةٌ [a land in<br>\

rock, &amp;c.]; and the sing. is ↓ سُدَّةٌ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The departure [or loss] of sight: (IAar, M:)<br>\
from the same word in the first of the senses expl.<br>\
in the next preceding paragraph. (M.)<br>\

سَدَّةٌ: see سَدٌّ, last sentence.<br>\
سُدَّةٌ A certain disease in the nose, (S, M, L, K,)<br>\
which stops it up, (M, L,) attacking the passage<br>\
of the breath, (L,) and preventing respiration;<br>\
(S, L;) as also ↓ سُدَادٌ. (S, M, L, K.) A thing<br>\

-A2-<br>\
Also [A vestibule, or porch, for shade and shelter,<br>\
before the door of a house: this is a common<br>\
signification of the word, and is app. what is<br>\
meant by its being said that] the سُدَّة is what is<br>\
before the door of a house: (M, A:) or, as some<br>\
say, a سَقِيفَة [i. e. roof, or covering, such as projects over the door of a house &amp;c.; or a place<br>\
roofed over]; (M:) or a ظُلَّة [i. e. roof, or cover-<br>\
ing, for shade and shelter,] over a door: (Mgh:)<br>\
or it is [a thing, or place,] like a صُفَّة [or سَقِيفَة]<br>\
before a بَيْت [or house, or perhaps here meaning<br>\
tent]: and a ظُلَّة at the door of a house (دَار):<br>\
(AA, TA:) or, accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, (TA,)<br>\
in the language of the Arabs [of the desert] it<br>\
signifies [a space such as is termed] a فِنَآء pertaining to a tent of hair-cloth and the like; and<br>\
those who make it to be like a صُفَّة, or like a<br>\
سَقِيفَة, explain the word accord. to the way in<br>\
which it is used by the people of the towns and<br>\
villages: (Msb, TA:) or it signifies the door<br>\
[itself]: (S, A, Mgh, K:) or it has this meaning<br>\
also: (Msb:) some thus apply it to the door<br>\
itself: (A&#39;Obeyd, L:) and the surrounding portico [of the interior court] of the largest, or<br>\
larger, mosque: (M, TA:) pl. سُدَدٌ. (S, L, Msb,<br>\
K.) You say, رَأَيْتُهُ قَاعِدًا بِسُدَّةِ بَابِهِ [I saw him<br>\
sitting in the vestibule of his door]: (S, TA:)<br>\
and بِسُدَّةِ دَارِهِ [in the vestibule before the door,<br>\
or at the door, of his house]. (TA.) Abu-d-Dardà<br>\
said, مَنْ يَغْشَ سُدَدَ السُّلْطَانِ يَقُمْ وَيَقْعُدْ, (S, L,)<br>\
or مَنْ يَأْتِ الخ, i. e. [He who comes to the vestibules, or gates, of the Sultán] experiences returns<br>\
of recent and old griefs, disquieting him so that<br>\
he is not able to remain at rest, but stands up and<br>\
sits down: (Mgh in art. قدم:) this he said when<br>\
he came to the gate of Mo&#39;áwiyeh and did not<br>\
receive permission to enter. (L.) And it is said<br>\
in a trad., الشُّعْثُ الرُّؤُوسِ الَّذِينَ لَا تُفْتَحُ لَهُمُ السُّدَدُ,<br>\
(S, A,) meaning الأَبْوَابُ [i. e. The shaggy, or dishevelled, and dusty, in the heads are those to<br>\
whom the doors will not be opened]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, Umm-Selemeh, addressing&#39; Áïsheh, termed<br>\
her a سُدَّة, i. e. a بَاب [meaning (assumed tropical:)  A means of communication[, between the Prophet and his people.<br>\
(L, from a trad.)<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  and see also سَدِيدٌ.<br>\
سَدَادٌ [an inf. n. of the intrans. verb سَدَّ; as also<br>\
↓ سَدَدٌ]. [Hence,] one says, إِنَّهُ لَذُو سَدَادٍ Verily<br>\
he has a faculty of hitting the right thing, or his<br>\
object or aim, in speaking, and in the managing<br>\
or disposing of affairs, and in shooting. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence also, as a subst.,] A thing that is<br>\
right, syn. صَوَابٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) and قَصْدٌ, (S,)<br>\
of what is said and of what is done; (S, A, * Msb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ سَدَدٌ, (S, A,) which is a contraction<br>\
of the former. (S.) One says, قَالَ سَدَادًا مِنَ القَوْلِ<br>\
He said a right thing [lit. of what is said, i. e.,<br>\
a right saying]; (S, A;) as also ↓ سَدَدًا. (A.)<br>\
And يُصِيبُ السَّدَادَ He hits the right thing in<br>\
speech [or action]. (S.) And هُوَ عَلَى سَدَادٍ مِنْ<br>\
أَمْرِهِ and ↓ سَدَدٍ [He is following a right course<br>\
of action in respect of his affair]. (A.) And<br>\
أَمْرُ فُلَانٍ يَجْرِى عَلَى السَّدَادِ The affair of such<br>\
a one goes on according to that which is right.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence the saying,] أَتَتْنَا رِيحٌ مِنْ<br>\
سَدَادِ أَرْضِهِمْ (tropical:)  A wind came to us from the direction of their land. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It is also used as<br>\
an epithet, syn. with سَدِيدٌ, q. v. (L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
السَّدَادُ [as though meaning The right projecter]<br>\
is a name that was given to a bow belonging to<br>\

سِدَادٌ A thing with which an interstice, or intervening space, is closed, or closed up: (AO, M,<br>\
L: [see also سَدٌّ:]) and a thing with which a<br>\
breach, or gap, (M, A,) is stopped, or stopped<br>\
up, (M,) or repaired, and made firm or strong:<br>\

(Meyd, in explanation of a prov. mentioned in<br>\
what follows,) Somewhat of milk that dries up<br>\

and ↓ سَدَادٌ, (ISk, S, M, Msb, K,) but the former<br>\
is the more chaste, (S,) and it alone is mentioned<br>\
by most authors in this saying, because it is from<br>\
سداد as meaning the “ stopper ” of a bottle;<br>\
(Msb;) and some say that ↓ سَداد, with fet-h, is<br>\
a corruption; (Msb, K;) expressly disallowed by<br>\
As and ISh; (Msb;) a prov.; (Meyd;) meaning (tropical:)  A thing by which want is supplied, (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K,) and by which life is preserved; accord.<br>\
to ISh, if incomplete; and accord. to As, a thing<br>\
by which somewhat of the entire wants of one&#39;s<br>\
case is supplied. (Msb.) One says also, أَصَبْتُ<br>\

taking, a right direction or tendency; tending<br>\
towards the right point or object: (S, M, A, L,<br>\

words and of actions]; (L;) who does that which<br>\
is right, (يَعْمَلُ بِالسَّدَادِ وَالقَصْدِ, S, L,) keeping to<br>\
the right way; in which sense it is related by<br>\
some with kesr, ↓ مُسَدِّدٌ. (L.) [Golius explains<br>\
it as meaning, on the authority of the S, who<br>\
