incessant continuance, (دَوَام, Kh, M, L, and<br>\
اِتِّصَال, Kh, L,) of time, (Kh, M, L,) either of<br>\

-b3-  Accord. to El-Fakhr Er-Rázee,<br>\
it is derived from السَّرْدُ, which denotes consecutiveness and uninterruptedness, and the م is added<br>\
to give intensiveness to the signification: if so,<br>\
its proper place is in art. سرد; its measure being<br>\
فَعْمَلٌ: (MF:) [thus] its م is augmentative like<br>\
the م in دُلَامِصٌ. (Bd in xxviii. 71.) ―<br>\
