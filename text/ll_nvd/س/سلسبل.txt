Easy [as a beverage] in the utmost degree:<br>\
(TA:) [applied as an epithet to milk, (لَبَن, so in<br>\
a copy of the M, and so in the CK,) or signifying<br>\
smooth, (لَيِّن, so in copies of the K,)] in which is<br>\
no roughness: (M, K:) and sometimes applied as<br>\
an epithet to water, (M, TA,) or beverage, meaning easy of entrance into the throat, or fauces.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Wine: (K:) so accord. to some,<br>\
as in the saying of &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Rawáhah,<br>\
in which it is [said to be] used as a syn. adjunct<br>\
to the preceding word:<br>\
إِنَّهُمْ عِنْدَ رَبِّهِمْ فِى جِنَان ٍ<br>\
يَشْرَبُونَ الرَّحِيقَ وَالسَّلْسَبِيلَا<br>\
[as though meaning Verily they are with their<br>\
Lord, in gardens, drinking wine and fermented<br>\
juice of the grape: but the meaning may be, the<br>\
choicest of wine, or the sweetest thereof, &amp;c., (see<br>\
رَحِيقٌ,) and wine easy to swallow, or the like].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A certain fountain in Paradise<br>\
[mentioned in art. سبل, q. v.]: (M, K:) Aboo-Bekr says that it may be a proper name of the<br>\
fountain, and properly imperfectly decl. [i. e.<br>\
without tenween] as being determinate and of the<br>\
fem. gender, but made to be with tenween at the<br>\
end of a verse in the Kur [lxxvi. 18] in order<br>\
that it may be conformable with other endings of<br>\
verses; or it may be an epithet applied to the<br>\
fountain, and therefore perfectly decl.: (TA:) Sb<br>\
mentions it as an ex. of an epithet: IAar says<br>\
that he had not heard it except in the Kur-án:<br>\
(M, TA:) I&#39;Ab says that سَلْسَبِيلًا [in the Kur]<br>\
means that slips, or steals, (يَنْسَلُّ,) into the throats,<br>\
or fauces: [as though the radical letters were<br>\
only س and ل, which some assert to be the case:]<br>\
accord. to Aboo-Jaafar El-Bákir, it means soft in<br>\
the part between the حَنْجَرَة [or head of the windpipe] and the حَلْق [or fauces]: the explanation<br>\
as meaning [سَلْ سَبِيلًا i. e.] سَلْ رَبَّكَ سَبِيلًا إِلَى هٰذِهِ<br>\
العَيْنِ [Ask of thy Lord a way of access to this<br>\
fountain] is a mistake, not allowable. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
The pl. is سَلَاسِبُ and سَلَاسِيبُ: and the pl. of<br>\
[the fem.] سَلْسَبِيلَةٌ is سَلْسَبِيلَاتٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [In<br>\
the present day it is applied to An artificial<br>\
fountain that throws up water.]<br>\
