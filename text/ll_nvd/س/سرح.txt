سَرْحٌ Cattle, or camels &amp;c., pasturing, (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) or pasturing where they please,<br>\
by themselves: (S, A, K:) or only such as are<br>\
sent, or driven, forth [to pasture] in the morning,<br>\
and brought, or driven, back in the evening to<br>\
their nightly resting-place: (L:) an inf. n. used<br>\
as a subst. (Mgh, Msb.) A&#39;Obeyd says that<br>\
سَرْحٌ and ↓ سَارِحٌ and ↓ سَارِحَةٌ signify Cattle, or<br>\
camels &amp;c.: and Khálid Ibn-Jembeh says that<br>\
↓ سَارِحَةٌ means camels and sheep or goats: and a single beast; as well as a collection [of beasts]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain kind of trees, of great size,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) and tall, (S, TA,) not depastured,<br>\
or seldom eaten by the camels &amp;c., but used for<br>\
their shade: they grow in Nejd, in plain, or soft,<br>\
and in rugged ground, but not in sand nor upon<br>\
a mountain; and have a yellow fruit: (TA:)<br>\
n. un. with ة: and it is said to be the same as<br>\
the آء: (S:) but this is a mistake; the fact being<br>\
that it bears a kind of berry termed آء, (K, TA,)<br>\
resembling the olive: (TA:) or any trees without<br>\
thorns: (K:) n. un. in this sense with ة: (Fr,<br>\
Ham p. 603, TA:) or any tall trees: (K:) or<br>\
[trees] of the kind called عِضَاه, great, with spreading branches, beneath which men alight in the<br>\
صَيْف [or summer]: (Ham ubi suprà:) accord. to<br>\
AHn, the سَرْحَة is a great tree with spreading<br>\
branches, beneath which people often alight,<br>\
widely extending; men alight beneath it in the<br>\
صَيْف [or summer], and pitch tents, or build<br>\
houses, beneath it; and its shade is good: accord.<br>\
to information given to Az by an Arab of the<br>\
desert not known by him to have uttered a lie,<br>\
it has a dusty colour, is not so tall as the أَثْل [a<br>\
species of tamarisk], has small leaves, and lank<br>\
branches, or twigs, and always grows slanting,<br>\
its inclination among all the trees being towards<br>\
the south (اليَمِين): Lth says that the سَرْح are a<br>\
kind of trees that have a fruit, and they are the أَلَآء<br>\
(الالآء [app. a mistranscription for الآء, i. e. the<br>\
آء,]); but Az says that this is a mistake: Lth<br>\
cites the saying of&#39; Antarah,<br>\
بَطَلٌ كَأَنَّ ثِيَابَهُ فِى سَرْحَةٍ<br>\
تُحْذَى نِعَالُ السِّبْتِ لَيْسَ بِتَوْءَمِ<br>\
(L,) i. e. He is a man of valour, tall of stature,<br>\
as though his clothes were upon a great tree such<br>\
as is called سرحة; sandals of سبت [q. v.] are cut<br>\
and made for him, such as are worn by the kings;<br>\
and he is not a twin; so that he has been well<br>\
suckled: (EM p. 245:) thus he describes this<br>\
person as tall of stature, showing that the سرحة<br>\
is a large tree: but the الآء [or آء] has no trunk<br>\
nor tallness: IAar says that the سَرْح are ذَكْوَان<br>\
that have become large; and the ذكوان are<br>\
certain trees having beautiful [shoots such as are<br>\
termed] عَسَالِيج: the pl. is سِرَاحٌ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The<br>\
n. un., سَرْحَةٌ, is applied to signify (tropical:)  A man&#39;s wife,<br>\
(S, A,) by a metonymy. (S.) The Arabs are said<br>\
by Az to term a woman, or wife, a سَرْحة growing<br>\
over water, because in this case it is in the most<br>\
beautiful condition. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Accord. to Forskål,<br>\
(Flora Aegypt. Arab. pp. cvi. and 68,) the<br>\
name of سرح is applied to a plant of the class<br>\
pentandria, which he terms Cadaba farinosa,<br>\
(described by him in p. 68,) growing in the<br>\
lower region of the mountains of Wádee-Surdud,<br>\
in Tihámeh.]<br>\
-A3-  Also The exterior court or yard<br>\
of a house, (K,) or, as in the L, of a gate, or<br>\
door. (TA.)<br>\
سُرُحٌ Easy; as also ↓ سَرِيحٌ. (L.) You say,<br>\
وَلَدَتْهُ سُرُحًا She brought him forth with ease.<br>\
(TA.) And تَخْرُجُ سُرُحًا It passes forth easily<br>\
and quickly: occurring in a trad., describing a<br>\
draught of water that satisfies thirst (شُرْبَةُ مَآءٍ).<br>\
(TA.) And نَاقَةٌ سُرُحٌ and ↓ مُنْسَرِحَةٌ A quick, or<br>\
swift, she-camel; (S;) as also ↓ سَرُوحٌ: (L:) or<br>\
a she-camel quick and easy in pace. (A, MA, and<br>\
Har p. 481.) And فَرَسٌ سُرُحٌ and ↓ مُنْسَرِحٌ (K)<br>\
and ↓ سِرْيَاحٌ, (TA,) or خَيْلٌ سُرُحٌ, (S,) A horse, or<br>\
horses, quick, or swift. (S, K.) [See also سَرَاحِ,<br>\
and سَرَّاحٌ.] And مِلَاطٌ سُرُحُ الجَنْبِ A shoulderblade, (TA,) or an upper arm-bone, of a camel,<br>\
(ISh, T, TA,) quick to go and come [or move<br>\
forwards and backwards]. (As, S, TA.) And<br>\
مِشْيَةٌ سُرُحٌ An easy gait, or manner of going;<br>\
(S, K;) like سُجُحٌ. (TA.) And عَطَآءٌ سُرُحٌ (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
gift promptly given, without deferring: (K:) or<br>\
(tropical:)  a gift that is easy and quick; a metaphorical<br>\
phrase from نَاقَةٌ سُرُحٌ expl. above. (Har p. 481.)<br>\
-A2-  [See also سَرِيحَةٌ, of which, in two senses, it<br>\
is a pl.]<br>\
سَرْحَةٌ A single tree of the kind called سَرْحٌ<br>\
[q. v.]. (Fr, S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A she-ass that has<br>\
attained to maturity but has not become pregnant.<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\
-A3-  And سَرْحَةُ, (O,) or السَّرْحَةُ, (K,) is<br>\
the name of A certain dog. (O, K.)<br>\
سِرْحَانٌ, of the measure فِعْلَانٌ, the ن being an<br>\
augmentative letter, (Sb, S,) from the verb سَرَحَ,<br>\
(TA,) The wolf; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
سِرْحَالٌ; (Yaakoob, K;) fem. سِرْحَانَةٌ (Ks, S) and<br>\
سِرْحَالَهٌ; (TA;) and the lion, (S, O, Msb, K,) in<br>\
the dial. of Hudheyl: (S, O:) pl. سَرَاحِينُ (S, A,<br>\
O, Msb, K) and سَرَاحٍ and سِرَاحٌ, (O, L, K,) but<br>\
the last not remembered to have been heard by<br>\
Az. (L.) It is said in a prov.,<br>\
سَقَطَ العَشَآءُ بِهِ عَلَى سِرْحَانِ<br>\
[The evening-meal, or supper, (i. e. the seeking<br>\
for it,) made him to fall, or light, upon a wolf]:<br>\
(S, Meyd:) accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, it originated<br>\
from a man&#39;s going forth to seek the eveningmeal, and falling upon a wolf, which devoured<br>\
him: accord. to As, from the like accident to a<br>\
beast: accord. to IAar, from a man&#39;s being slain<br>\
by another man, named سِرْحَان: it is applied to<br>\
the seeking an object of want that leads one to<br>\
destruction. (Meyd. [See Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov.<br>\
i. 599: but the name there written “ Hasahah ”<br>\
is هُزْلَة; accord. to Meyd, the father, but accord.<br>\
to the O, the brother, of Sirhán.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) i. e. from السِّرْحَانُ as meaning “ the<br>\
wolf,” or, as some say, “the lion,” (TA,) ذَنَبُ<br>\
السِّرْحَانِ The false dawn; (Mgh, O, K, TA;) i. e.<br>\
the first [dawn]. (TA. [A term nearly agreeing<br>\
with the Greek<br>\
λυ� degreesό�(assumed tropical:) ω�]) ―<br>\
-b3-  السِّرْحَانُ, (O, K,)<br>\
or سِرْحَانٌ, (TA,) is also the name of A certain<br>\
dog: and of a certain horse: and of another<br>\
horse. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The middle of a wateringtrough or tank: (O, K:) pl. as above. (K.)<br>\
سَرَاحٌ a subst. from تَسْرِيحُ المَرْأَةِ; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
[i. e., a subst.] signifying The dismissal of a wife<br>\
by divorcement: (Bd in xxxiii. 28 [where it is<br>\
used as a quasi-inf. n., as it is also in verse 48 of<br>\
the same chap.]:) like طَلَاقٌ and فِرَاقٌ, it signifies<br>\
divorcement explicitly. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And Dismissal<br>\
in a general sense. Hence,] it is said in a prov.,<br>\
السَّرَاحُ مِنَ النَّجَاحِ (tropical:)  [i. e. Dismissal is a part of<br>\
the accomplishment of one&#39;s want]; (S, A, L;)<br>\
meaning, when thou canst not accomplish a man&#39;s<br>\
want, make him to despair; for thy doing so will<br>\
be in his estimation an act that will stand him in<br>\
lieu of thy helping him to accomplish it: (S, L:<br>\
[in some copies of the former, for فَأَيْئِسْهُ, we find<br>\
فَآيَسْتَهُ:]) or it is applied to a man who does not<br>\
desire to accomplish the want [of another]; and<br>\
means, it behooves thee to make him to despair if<br>\
thou accomplish not his want. (Meyd. [See a<br>\
similar prov. voce شَرَاحٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Haste, ex-<br>\
pedition, or promptness. (TA.) ―<br>\

and K in art. روح) and rest. (A in that art.)<br>\
