drank the remains: (A:) or the remainder of<br>\

تَسَاَّ^َ see what next precedes.<br>\
سُؤْرٌ A remainder, or residue; (T, M, Msb, K;)<br>\
of a thing, (M,) or of anything; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ سُؤْرَةٌ: (T:) or a remainder of beverage in the<br>\
bottom of a vessel after one has drunk; (S, * A;)<br>\
such as is left by a rat or mouse &amp;c. after drinking: (S:) properly applied to a remainder of<br>\
water left by the drinker in a vessel or wateringtrough: and tropically to (tropical:)  a remainder of<br>\
food, &amp;c.: (Mgh:) and ↓ سُؤْرَةٌ signifies likewise<br>\
(tropical:)  a remainder of food: (A:) pl. of the former<br>\
أَسْآرٌ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb,) and, by transposition,<br>\
آسَارٌ, like آبَارٌ and آرَامٌ, pls. of بِئْرٌ and رِئْمٌ. (M.)<br>\
[See also سَائِرٌ, below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  الصَّقْرِ ↓ سُؤْرَةُ means<br>\
(tropical:)  What remains of the portion of the flesh of the<br>\
game that is given to the hawk which has captured<br>\
it. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And ↓ سُؤْرَةٌ also signifies (tropical:)  A remainder of youthful vigour in a man, (M, K,)<br>\
or in a woman who has passed the prime of<br>\
youth, (Lth,) or in a woman who has passed the<br>\
period of youth but not been rendered decrepit by<br>\
old age. (A.) [See also سُؤْدَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  What<br>\
is good, or excellent, of property, or of camels or<br>\
the like: pl. سُؤَرٌ. (L.) [App. because such is<br>\
left when one has parted with the bad.] ―<br>\
-b5-  ↓ سُؤْرَةٌ<br>\
مِنَ القُرْآنِ (tropical:)  [means A chapter of the Kur-án;]<br>\
so called because it is a portion, (A,) or a remainder: (TA:) or it may be from the signification immediately preceding: (L:) or it is a dial.<br>\
var. of سُورَةٌ: (K:) pl. سُؤَرٌ. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  فُلَانٌ<br>\
سُؤْرُ شَرٍّ means Such a one is very evil or mischievous. (A.)<br>\
سُؤْرَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
five places.<br>\
سَأّرٌ One who leaves a remainder, or residue,<br>\
(S, M, K,) of beverage in the bottom of the vessel<br>\
from which he has drunk: (S, M:) [and (tropical:)  of<br>\
food in a dish; &amp;c.:] deviating from rule, (S,<br>\
M,) like جَبَّارٌ from أَجْبَرَ: (S:) [see دَرَّاكٌ, which<br>\
is said to be the only other instance of the kind:]<br>\
by rule it should be ↓ مُسْئِرٌ; (S, K;) which is<br>\
[said to be] also allowable: (K:) but MF denies<br>\
this; (TA;) or it may be [regular] from سَأَرَ or<br>\
[irregular] from أَسْأَرَ. (T, TA.)<br>\
سَائِرٌ The rest, or remainder, (T, and M in art.<br>\
سير, and Msb and K,) of a thing, (Z, M, Msb,)<br>\
whether little or much; (T, Msb;) and of men,<br>\
or people: (Sgh; Msb:) not the whole, or all, as<br>\
many imagine it to mean, (Sgh, Msb, K,) though<br>\
people use it in this latter sense, (IAth,) which<br>\
Sgh asserts to be a vulgar error: (Msb:) it occurs<br>\
repeatedly in trads., and always in the former<br>\
sense: (IAth:) or it is sometimes used [in chaste<br>\
Arabic] in the latter sense: (K:) and is correctly<br>\
so used accord. to AAF and J and IJ and ElJawáleekee and IB, the last of whom confirms<br>\
this signification by many examples and evident<br>\
proofs: but whether, in this sense, it is derived<br>\
from السَّيْر, as AAF and J and others hold, or<br>\
from سُورٌ the “ wall which surrounds a town or<br>\
city,” as others hold, is disputed: (TA:) and<br>\
سَارُ الشَّىْءِ is a dial. var. of سَائِرُهُ. (S in art. سير.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  An Arab of the desert became the guest of a<br>\
party, and they ordered the female slave to perfume him; whereupon he said, بَطْنِى عَطِّرِى<br>\
وَسَائِرِى ذَرِى [My belly perfume thou, and the<br>\
rest of me leave thou]: (K:) but in other lexicons than the K, we find أَعْطِرِى. (TA in art.<br>\
عطر.) This saying is a well-known prov. (TA.)<br>\
[In the TA it is added that سائري here signifies<br>\
the whole of me, or all of me: but this is an evident mistake.] You say this to a man who gives<br>\
you what you do not want, and refuses you what<br>\
you want. (Sgh, TA in art. عطر.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is related,<br>\
also, that a hostile attack was made upon a people,<br>\
and they cried out for aid to the sons of their<br>\
uncle; but these held back from them until they<br>\
had been made captives and taken away; then<br>\
they came inquiring respecting them; and the<br>\
person asked replied, أَسَائِرَ اليَوْمِ وَقَدْ زَالَ الظُّهْرُ<br>\
[What, all the day, when the noon has passed?]<br>\
(K:) i. e., Dost thou covet what is remote, (مَا بَعُدَ,<br>\
(S, K, TA, in a copy of the S and in one of the<br>\
K and in the CK مَا بَعْدُ,) when [reason for]<br>\
despair hath become manifest to thee: for when<br>\
one wants the whole day, and the noon has passed,<br>\
he must despair like as he despairs of accomplishing his want at sunset. (S in art. سير, and K.)<br>\
This saying is a prov.; (S, A;) and is used with<br>\
reference to a thing which one hopes to attain<br>\
when its time has passed. (A.)<br>\
[<br>\
أَسَائِرُ expl. by Golius as a pl. meaning “ Partes<br>\
reliquæ ” is an evident mistake, app. caused by a<br>\
misunderstanding of the latter prov. mentioned<br>\
above.]<br>\
