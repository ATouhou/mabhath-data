سَلَبَهُ, (S, A, K,) aor.<br>\
سَلُبَ, (TA,) inf. n. سَلْبٌ<br>\
(S, K) and سَلَبٌ, (K,) from the former of which<br>\
the pl. سُلُوبٌ has been formed, on the authority<br>\
of hearsay, (El-Jurjánee, Msb in art. قصد,) He<br>\
seized it, or carried it off, by force; (S, A, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ استلبهُ. (S, K.) You say, سَلَبَهُ الشَّىْءَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
سَلُبَ, inf. n. سَلْبٌ and سَلَبٌ; and إِيَّاهُ ↓ استلبهُ;<br>\
(M, TA;) He seized, or carried off, by force<br>\
[from him the thing; or he spoiled him, despoiled<br>\
him, plundered him, or deprived him, of the<br>\
thing]. (TA.) And سَلَبْتُهُ ثَوْبَهُ, (Mgh, * Msb,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
سَلُبَ, (Msb,) inf. n. سَلْبٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) I took<br>\
away from him his garment; (Mgh, * Msb;) as<br>\
also ↓ اسلبتهُ [perhaps a mistranscription for<br>\
↓ استلبتهُ, but another instance of the former of<br>\
these two verbs, in a similar sense, occurs in what<br>\
follows]: originally, سَلَبْتُ ثَوْبَ زيَدٍْ [I took away<br>\
the garment of Zeyd]; but the verb has been<br>\
made to have زيد for its object, and the ثوب is<br>\
postponed, and put in the accus. case as a specificative [though by rule the specificative should be<br>\
indeterminate]; and it may be suppressed, [so<br>\
that you may say simply, سَلَبْتُهُ, meaning I took<br>\
away from him what was upon him or with him,<br>\
spoiled him, or plundered him,] the meaning<br>\
being understood. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence] one says<br>\
also, سَلَبَهُ فُؤَادَهُ وَعَقْلَهُ (tropical:)  [He, or it, despoiled him,<br>\
or deprived him, of his heart and his reason],<br>\
and ↓ اسلبهُ. (A, TA.) [The latter one might<br>\
think to be a mistranscription for ↓ استلبهُ were it<br>\
not for an instance of the same verb before men-<br>\
tioned, and for the fact that it is immediately<br>\
followed in the A by وَهُوَ مُسْلَبُ العَقْلِ: perhaps,<br>\
however, مُسْلَب may be here a mistake for<br>\
مُسْلِب.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And اُسْلُبْ هٰذِهِ القَصَبَةَ (assumed tropical:)  Peel thou<br>\
this cane, or reed. (TA.) ―<br>\

logic, سَلْبٌ is used to signify (assumed tropical:)  Privation, or<br>\
deprivation, in a general sense; and (assumed tropical:)  negation;<br>\
opposed to إِثْبَاتٌ and إِيجَابٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  سَلْبٌ [as an<br>\
inf. n. of which the verb (app. سَلَبَ) is not mentioned] (assumed tropical:)  The going, or journeying, lightly and<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  [The black of the eye became depressed so that<br>\
it became a hollow in consequence of their going<br>\
with much lightness and quickness: سَلْبَا, for سَلْبًا,<br>\

as appears from what follows], aor.<br>\
سَلَبَ, (assumed tropical:)  He [or<br>\
she] put on black garments (K, TA) which<br>\
women wear at assemblies for the purpose of<br>\
mourning. (TA. [See also 5.])<br>\

سَلَّبَ see 5, in three places.<br>\
3<br>\
سالبهُ الشَّىْءَ, if used, means He contended<br>\

أَحَدَّتْ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  She abstained from the wearing of<br>\
ornaments, and the use of perfumes, and dye for<br>\
the hands &amp;c., and put on the garments of mourning,] عَلَى زَوْجِهَا [for her husband]: (K:) or, as<br>\
some say, إِحْدَادٌ is for the husband; (S, A;) but<br>\
تَسَلُّبٌ is sometimes for another than the husband:<br>\
(S, TA:) [therefore] تسلّبت signifies (assumed tropical:)  she put on<br>\
the black garments of mourning; (M, TA;) as<br>\

7<br>\

مَفْعُولٌ, i. e., (TA,) i. q. مَسْلُوبٌ [used in the<br>\
manner of a subst., or as an epithet in which the<br>\
quality of a subst. is predominant]: (Mgh, TA:)<br>\
pl. أَسْلَابٌ. (M, A, Msb, K.) You say, أَخَذَ<br>\
سَلَبَ القَتِيلِ [He took the spoil of the slain man],<br>\
and أَسْلَابَ القَتْلَى [the spoils of the slain men].<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The hide and shanks and paunch<br>\
of a slaughtered animal. (K. [App. so called<br>\
because given to the slaughterer, as though they<br>\

voce بَدَنٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  The peel, or rind, [or skin,]<br>\
of a cane, or reed, (K, TA,) and of a tree. (TA.)<br>\
And [particularly] The bark, or rind, of a kind<br>\
of tree (S, K) well known (S) in El-Yemen, of<br>\
which ropes are made, (S, K,) and which is<br>\
coarser and harder than the fibres of the Theban<br>\
palm-tree: (S:) hence it is that a well-known<br>\
kind of [thick] rope [made of the fibres of the<br>\
common palm-tree] is called by the vulgar ↓ سَلَبَةٌ:<br>\
(TA:) or the bark of a kind of tree of which are<br>\
made [baskets of the kind called] سِلَال: (Sh,<br>\
TA:) there is a market called ↓ سُوقُ السَّلَّابِينَ in<br>\
El-Medeeneh, (Sh, S, K, TA,) and in Mekkeh<br>\
also, as being the market [of the sellers, or manufacturers, of what are made] of سَلَب: (Sh, TA:)<br>\
it is also [said to be] (K) a certain kind of tall<br>\
tree, (M, K,) growing symmetrically, which is<br>\
taken and laid beneath hot ashes (يُمَلُّ) and then<br>\
split asunder, whereupon there comes forth form<br>\
it a white مُشَاقَة [or coarse fibrous substance] like<br>\
[the fibres of the palm-tree, called] لِيف; and it is<br>\
one of the best of the materials of which ropes are<br>\
made: the n. un. is with ة: (M:) and (M, K)<br>\
AHn says, (M,) it is a certain plant (M, K)<br>\
which grows in form like candles, except that it<br>\
is larger and longer, and of which are made<br>\
ropes of every sort: (M:) and (M, K) some say,<br>\
(M,) it is the fibrous substance (ليف) of the<br>\
Theban palm-tree, (M, K,) this Lth asserts it to<br>\
be, (TA,) which is brought from Mekkeh, (M,)<br>\
and Lth adds, and it is white; but Az says that<br>\
Lth has erred respecting it: A&#39;Obeyd says, I<br>\
asked respecting it, and was told, it is not the<br>\
fibrous substance of the Theban palm-tree, but is<br>\
a kind of tree well known in El-Yemen, of which<br>\
ropes are made: and some say that it is the خُوص<br>\
[or leaves] of the ثَمَام [or panic grass]: and this<br>\
[says SM] is what is commonly known among<br>\
us in El-Yemen: (TA:) [accord. to Forskål,<br>\
(Flor. Aegypt. Arab., p. cx.) this name is applied<br>\
in El-Yemen to a species of hyacinth, which he<br>\
terms hyacinthus aporus.] A poet says, (S,)<br>\
namely, [Murrah] Ibn-Mahkán [El-Temeemee],<br>\
(M,)<br>\
فَنَشْنَشَ الجِلْدَ عَنْهَاوَهْىَ بَارِكَةٌ<br>\

(S, M, *) i. e. And he stripped off quickly the<br>\
skin [from her, while she was lying upon her<br>\
breast, like as the two hands of the twister of<br>\
ropes strips off quickly the seleb]: (S in art.<br>\
نش:) some read قَاتِلٍ, meaning [by the word<br>\
following it] “ what is seized, or carried off by<br>\
force, from one slain: ” (M:) As read فَاتِلٍ, with<br>\
ف; IAar, with ق: Th says that the right reading<br>\
is that of As. (S in the present art.)<br>\
سَلِبٌ Light, or active, (K, TA,) and quick.<br>\
(TA.) You say, رَجُلٌ سَلِبُ اليَدَيْنِ بِالطَّعْنِ A<br>\

thrusting, or piercing: and ثَوْرٌ سَلِبُ الطَّعْنِ بِالقَرْنِ<br>\

سَلُوبٌ as an epithet applied to a spear: (Ham<br>\

[How goodly is what is unclad of her person!<br>\
or, her state of nudity!]. (K.)<br>\

arrow: accord. to AHn, the sinew that is wound<br>\
upon the لِيط [or skin of the reed, or cane,] of the<br>\
arrow. (M.)<br>\
سِلَابٌ sing. of سُلُبٌ, which signifies The black<br>\
garments of women at their assemblies for mourning: (S:) MF says that the former is expl. in the<br>\
K as meaning black garments, which necessarily<br>\
implies that it is a pl.; and the latter is there said<br>\
to be its pl., which necessarily implies that it is a<br>\
sing.: (TA:) [but it may be replied that the<br>\
author of the K regarded the former as a pl.<br>\
without a sing.; and the latter, as a pl. pl.:] or<br>\
both signify black garments worn by women; and<br>\
the sing. is ↓ سَلَبَةٌ: (M:) accord. to the T, سِلَابٌ<br>\
signifies a black garment with which a woman<br>\
mourning for the death of her husband covers her<br>\
head: accord. to the R, a black خِرْقَة [or piece<br>\

[Hence] one says شَجَرَةٌ سَلِيبٌ (tropical:)  A tree despoiled,<br>\
or deprived, of its leaves and its branches: (M,<br>\
K, TA:) or of which the leaves and fruit have<br>\
been taken: (A:) pl. سُلُبٌ, as in the phrases<br>\
نَخْلٌ سُلُبٌ palm-trees upon which is no fruit,<br>\
and شَجَرٌ سُلُبٌ trees upon which are no leaves;<br>\
the sing. being of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense<br>\
of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (S:) and one says also<br>\
↓ شَجَرَةٌ سُلُبٌ, [using سُلُبٌ as a sing., like other<br>\
words of the same measure mentioned in what follows,] meaning a tree of which the leaves have become<br>\

applied to a woman as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Whose husband<br>\

of mourning. (M. [See an ex. of this last word<br>\
with the affix ة, used as a pl., in a verse cited<br>\
voce خَطْبٌ; and an ex. of its pl., مُسَلِّبَات, in a<br>\
verse cited voce ثَدْىُ.]) Also, applied, to a she-camel, and so ↓ سَالِبٌ and ↓ سَلُوبٌ and ↓ مُسْلِبٌ,<br>\

mentioned in the M:) and in like manner applied<br>\
to a woman: (M, K:) the pl. (of سَلُوبٌ, S, M, or<br>\

meaning despoiled, or deprived, of her young one:<br>\
