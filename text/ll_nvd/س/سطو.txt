سَطَا بِهِ (S, M, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and عَلَيْهِ (M,<br>\
Msb, K,) aor. يَسْطُو, (Msb,) inf. n. سَطْوٌ (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K) and سَطْوَةٌ, (M, Msb, K,) or the latter is<br>\
an inf. n. un., (S,) He sprang, or rushed, upon<br>\
him; made an assault, or attack, upon him; syn.<br>\
صَالَ: (M, K:) he sprang upon him and seized<br>\
him violently or laid violent hands upon him:<br>\
(Bd in xxii. 71:) he seized him violently with<br>\
uplifted hand: (Er-Rághib, TA:) he overbore<br>\
him, overpowered him, or subdued him, (قَهَرَهُ,<br>\
Lth, S, Msb, K, or تَطَاوَلَ عَلَيْهِ, T, TA,) by<br>\
seizing him violently, or laying violent hands<br>\
upon him, (Lth, S, K,) and abased him; or he<br>\
seized him with great violence: (Msb:) or he<br>\
stretched forth his hand to him [to seize him].<br>\
(Th, M, TA.) And in like manner, (M,) one<br>\
says of a stallion [camel], يَسْطُو عَلَى طَرُوقَتِهِ<br>\
[He springs, or rushes, upon, or he overbears, the<br>\
she-camel that he covers]. (S, M. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  سَطَا عَلَى<br>\
النَّاقَةِ, (S, M, K,) and الفَرَسِ, inf. n. سَطْوٌ and<br>\
سُطُوٌّ, (M,) He (the pastor) put his hand into the<br>\
رَحِم [or vulva] of the she-camel, (S, M, K,) and<br>\
of the mare, (M,) to extract, (S, K,) or and<br>\
extracted, (M,) the sperma of the stallion: (S,<br>\
M, K:) when this is not extracted, the she-camel<br>\
does not conceive: (S:) or this is done when she<br>\
has been leaped by a stallion of low race; or when<br>\
the sperma is bad, and she has not conceived in<br>\
consequence of it. (M.) And He extracted from<br>\
her (i. e. a she-camel, TA) the fœtus, dead: (M,<br>\
TA:) and مَسَطَ signifies “ he extracted the sperma<br>\
of the stallion: ” thus Az distinguishes between<br>\
the two verbs. (TA.) Accord. to IAar, one<br>\
says, سَطَا عَلَى الحَامِلِ, and سَاطَ, which is formed<br>\
by transposition, meaning He extracted the fœtus,<br>\
or young one, of the pregnant female. (TA.)<br>\
And A&#39;Obeyd mentions السَّطْوُ as used in relation<br>\
to a woman: it is said in a trad. of El-Hasan,<br>\
لَا بَأْسَ أَنْ يَسْطُوَ الرَّجُلُ عَلَى المَرْأَةِ [There is, or<br>\
will be, no harm in the man&#39;s extracting the<br>\
fœtus of the woman]; (M, TA;) which Lth<br>\
explains by saying, when her child sticks fast in<br>\
her belly, dead, it may be extracted [by him]<br>\
when fear is entertained for her and a woman is<br>\
not found to do this. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  سَطَا said of a<br>\
horse, (M, K,) inf. n. سَطْوٌ, (M,) He went at<br>\
random, heedlessly, or in a headlong manner, not<br>\
obeying guidance. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, said of a<br>\
horse, He went with wide step: (S, M, K:) or<br>\
raised his tail in running; the doing of which is<br>\
approved. (M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also (tropical:)  It was, or became,<br>\
abundant, or copious; said of water. (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And (tropical:)  He tasted food; (K,<br>\
TA;) and took it with the hand, or with the<br>\
extended hand. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And i. q. عَاقَبَ [app.<br>\
as meaning He punished: see سَطْوَةٌ, below].<br>\
(M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And سَطَاهَا He compressed her;<br>\
[and so سَطَأَهَا and شَطَأَهَا;] on the authority of<br>\
Aboo-Sa&#39;eed. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
ساطاهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُسَاطَاةٌ, (TA,) He treated<br>\
him with hardness, severity, or rigour: (K, TA:)<br>\
so says Az, on the authority of IAar. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And He treated him with gentleness, or tenderness.<br>\
(IAar, T, TA.) Thus it has two contr. significations. (TA.)<br>\
سَطْوَةٌ [as a simple subst., or] as an inf. n. un.,<br>\
has for its pl. سَطَوَاتٌ. (S.) It signifies [A<br>\
spring, or rush; or an assault, or attack: &amp;c.:<br>\
(see 1, first sentence:) impetuosity in war or<br>\
battle:] a reviling: a beating: and punishment,<br>\
or chastisement; as in the saying, اِتَّقِ سَطْوَتَهُ<br>\
[Guard thyself against his punishment, or chastisement; or it may mean in this phrase, his<br>\
violence, or impetuosity]. (TA.)<br>\
سَاطٍ [act. part. n. of 1, Springing, or rushing;<br>\
making an assault, or attack: &amp;c. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,]<br>\
applied to a horse, That springs, or rushes, upon<br>\
other horses, and stands upon his hind legs and<br>\
attacks with his fore legs: (T, TA: [in the Ham<br>\
p. 383, and raises his fore legs:]) or a horse<br>\
wide in step: (As, S, M, K:) or that attacks<br>\
other horses: (S:) or that raises his tail in his<br>\
running; (S, M, K;) the doing of which is<br>\
approved. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A stallion-camel excited<br>\
by lust, and going forth from camels to other<br>\
camels (S, K) in consequence thereof. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And What is tall, or long, (K, TA,) of camels<br>\
&amp;c. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  الأَيْدِى السَّوَاطِى The hands that<br>\
reach, or take, or take hold of, a thing. (TA.)<br>\
