سَرْطَمَ He (a man) was, or became, silent.<br>\
(Sh, TA in art. رطم.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [From what follows, it<br>\
would seem to signify also He was perspicuous<br>\
in speech, or eloquent.]<br>\
سَرْطَمٌ Long, or tall; (S, K;) as also ↓ سِرْطِمٌ: (K:)<br>\
in the latter sense, the former epithet is applied to a<br>\
man; as also ↓ سِرْطُومٌ and ↓ سُرَاطِمٌ: (M:) and<br>\
a poet (namely &#39;Adee Ibn-Zeyd, TA) uses the<br>\
phrase سَرْطَمُ اللَّحْيَيْنِ [long in the two jaw-bones].<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The gullet; because of its width.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, as also ↓ سِرْطِمٌ, Wide in the fauces,<br>\
quick in swallowing, (M, K,) or that swallows<br>\
much, (TA,) with [largeness of] body and make:<br>\
(M, K:) or that swallows everything: held by<br>\
Kh to be of the triliteral-radical class; (M, TA;)<br>\
and mentioned in art. سرط. (TA. [See سُرَاطِىٌّ.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And hence ↓ the latter, (assumed tropical:)  An eloquent speaker:<br>\
(M in art. سرط and in the present art., and<br>\
K * in the former:) or perspicuous in speech;<br>\
(M and K in the present art.;) as also سَرْطَمٌ.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  سَرْطَمٌ is also expl. as meaning الذى<br>\
يستوعب الزمام [which may be rendered That<br>\
takes the whole of the nose-rein, or leading-rope;<br>\
but the exact meaning must be determined from<br>\
the context]; and so ↓ سُرْطُمَانٌ. (Freytag, from<br>\
the Deewán of Jereer.)<br>\
