Msb,) inf. n. سَدْسٌ, (M, Msb, TA,) He took<br>\
the sixth part of the possessions of the people.<br>\
(M, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And سَدَسَ القَوْمَ, aor.<br>\
سَدِسَ, (S,<br>\
M, Msb, K,) inf. n. سَدْسٌ, (Msb, TA,) He was,<br>\
or became, the sixth of the people: (M, Msb, K:)<br>\
or he made them, with himself, six. (S in art.<br>\

fifty-nine, to be sixty with himself. (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
S in art. ثلث.) And سَدَسَ also signifies He<br>\
made fifteen to be sixteen. (T in art. ثلث.)<br>\
2<br>\
سدّسهُ, inf. n. تَسْدِيسٌ, He made it six. (EshSheybánee, and K voce وَحَّدَهُ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He made it to<br>\

-b3-  سدّس لِامْرَأَتِهِ, or عِنْدَهَا,<br>\

4<br>\

(S, M, Msb:) also the party of men became sixty.<br>\
(M and L in art. ثلث.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اسدس البَعِيرُ The<br>\
camel cast the tooth after the رَبَاعِيَة; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
cast the tooth called سَدِيس; (M, A;) which he<br>\
does in his eighth year: (S, IF, A, Msb:) and in<br>\
like manner one says of a sheep or goat. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  اسدس الرَّجُلُ The man was, or became, one<br>\
whose camels came to water on the sixth day,<br>\
counting the day of the next preceding drinking<br>\
as the first. (S, * K, * TA.) [See سِدْسٌ.]<br>\
سُدْسٌ: see سُدُسٌ.<br>\
سِدْسٌ is the original form of سِتٌّ, (M, K,)<br>\
fem. of سِتَّةٌ, which is originally سِدْسَةٌ, (M,)<br>\
[meaning Six; for] the dim. [of سِتٌّ is ↓ سُدَيْسٌ,<br>\
and that] of سِتَّةٌ is ↓ سُدَيْسَةٌ; and the pl.<br>\
is أَسْدَاسٌ. (S in art. ست, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also [The<br>\
drinking of camels on the sixth day, counting the<br>\
day of the next preceding drinking as the first;<br>\
as will be seen from what here follows;] the<br>\
period of the drinking of camels [next] after that<br>\
called خِمْسٌ: or after six days and five nights:<br>\
(M, TA:) or their being kept from the water five<br>\
days, and coming to it on the sixth: (S:) but<br>\
Sgh says that this is a mistake, and that the<br>\
correct meaning of the term is, their being kept<br>\
from the water four days, and coming to it on the<br>\
fifth; and so it is explained in the [A and] K:<br>\
(TA:) or their drinking one day, then being kept<br>\
from the water four days, then coming to it on<br>\
the fifth day; so [by the application of the term<br>\
سِدْسٌ] they include in their reckoning the first<br>\
day in which the camels drink: (Aboo-Sahl,<br>\
TA:) or their remaining in the place of pasture<br>\
four days [after drinking], then coming to the<br>\
water on the fifth: (TA:) pl. أَسْدَاسٌ. (M, Sgh,<br>\
TA.) You say, وَرَدَتْ إِبْلُهُ سِدْسًا [His camels<br>\
came to the water on the sixth day, counting the<br>\
day of the next preceding drinking as the first].<br>\
(S, A, K.) [Hence the saying,] ضَرَبَ أَخْمَاسًا<br>\
لِأَسْدَاسٍ [which see expl. voce خِمْسٌ]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also The sixth young one, or offspring. (A in<br>\
art. ثلث.)<br>\
سَدَسٌ: see سَدِيسٌ, in three places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and, as<br>\
an epithet applied to a calf, see عَضْبٌ.<br>\
سُدُسٌ (S, M, A, Msb, K) and ↓ سُدْسٌ (S, Msb,<br>\
K) A sixth part; (S, M, A, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ سَدِيسٌ, (S, Msb, K,) a form used by some, like<br>\
as one says عُشْرٌ and عَشِيرٌ: (S:) pl. أَسْدَاسٌ. (M,<br>\
Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app., the saying, ضَرَبَ<br>\
أَخْمَاسَهُ فِى أَسْدَاسِهِ, which see expl. voce خُمُسٌ.]<br>\
[<br>\
سُدَاسَ as meaning Six and six together, or six<br>\
at a time and six at a time, seems not to have<br>\
been heard: see عُشَارَ. But Freytag mentions<br>\
سُدَاسٌ as used by El-Mutanebbee for سِتَّة.]<br>\
سَدُوسٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
سُدُوسٌ (Sh, S, M, K) and ↓ سَدُوُسٌ, (Sh, M, K,)<br>\

kind called] طَيْلَسَان: (M:) or a طيلسان, (S, M,<br>\
K,) or any garment, (Sh,) of the colour termed<br>\
خُضْرَة [here app. meaning a dark, or an ashy,<br>\
dust-colour]. (Sh, S, M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  And the former,<br>\
(K,) or the latter, (M,) Smoke-black of fat; or<br>\
lamp-black; syn. نِيلَنْجٌ. (M, K.)<br>\

-A2-<br>\
Also The tooth that is before that called the<br>\
بَازِل; (S, K;) after that called the رَبَاعِيَة; (M,<br>\
L, TA;) as also ↓ سَدِسٌ; (S, K;) masc. and fem.,<br>\
because the fem. names of teeth are all with ة,<br>\
except سَدَسٌ and سَدِيسٌ and بَازِلٌ: (S:) the pl.<br>\
(of the former, S,) is سُدُسٌ and (of the latter, S)<br>\
سُدْسٌ. (S, K.) You say, of a camel, أَلْقَى سَدِيسَهُ<br>\
and ↓ سَدَسَهُ [He cast his tooth called the سديس<br>\
and سدس]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (Mgh,) A<br>\
camel, (M, A, Mgh, Msb,) and a sheep or goat,<br>\
(M, TA,) casting his سَدِيس, (M, A, TA,) or his<br>\
tooth that is after the رَبَاعِيَة; (Msb;) i. e., in the<br>\

(A, Mgh, TA:) masc. and fem.: (M, TA:) or a<br>\
sheep or goat six years old: (S, K:) pl. سُدُسٌ.<br>\
(M.) A poet, (S,) namely, Mansoor Ibn-Misjáh,<br>\
speaking of a fine for homicide, taken from among<br>\
selected camels, (TA,) says,<br>\
فَطَافَ كَمَا طَافَ المُصَدِّقُ وَسْطَهَا<br>\
يُخِيِّرُ مِنْهَا فِى البَوَازِلِ وَالسُّدْسِ<br>\
[And he went round about, as the collector of the<br>\
poor-rate went round about, amid them, preferring<br>\
certain of them, among the nine-year-old and the<br>\
eight-year-old camels]. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also A sort<br>\
of measure, or a sort of مَكُّوك, [in some copies of<br>\
the K ضَرْبٌ مِنَ المَكَايِيلِ, and in others and in<br>\
the O ضرب من المَكَاكِيكِ,] (O, K,) with which<br>\
dates are measured. (O.)<br>\
-A4-  سَدِيسَ in the saying<br>\
لَا آتِيكَ سَدِيسَ عُجَيْسٍ is a dial. var. of سَجِيسَ,<br>\
q. v. (S.)<br>\
سُدَيْسٌ and سُدَيْسَةٌ: see سِدْسٌ.<br>\

إِزَارٌ, (S, A, K,) Six cubits in length; (A, K;) as<br>\

-b2-  Also [as<br>\
meaning Six spans in height, said to be] applied<br>\
to a slave. (Msb in art. خمس.) [But see<br>\
خُمَاسِىٌّ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [Also A word composed of six<br>\
letters, radical only, or radical and augmentative.]<br>\
سَادِسٌ [Sixth]: fem. with ة. (S, K, &amp;c.) See<br>\

-b2-  [سَادِسَ عَشَرَ, and the<br>\
fem. سَادِسَةَ عَشْرَةَ, meaning Sixteenth, are subject<br>\
to the same rules as ثَالِثَ عَشَرَ and its fem., expl.<br>\
in art. ثلث, q. v.]<br>\
سُنْدُسٌ: see art. سندس.<br>\
مُسَدَّسٌ A thing composed of six layers or<br>\
strata, or of six distinct fascicles or the like.<br>\
