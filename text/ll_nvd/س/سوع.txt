سَاعَتِ الإِبِلُ, aor. تَسُوعُ, (S, K,) inf. n. سَوْعٌ,<br>\
(S,) The camels were left to themselves, (S, K,)<br>\
without a pastor; (K;) as also ساعت with<br>\
تَسِيعُ for its aor. and سَيْعٌ for its inf. n. (Sh.)<br>\
3<br>\
عَامَلَهُ مُسَاوَعَةً [He bargained with him for<br>\
work by, or for, the hour,] is from السَّاعَةُ, like<br>\
مُيَاوَمَةً from اليَوْمُ. (S, K. [See also the last sentence of the second paragraph of art. سعى.]) [It<br>\
is added in the S, that neither of them is used<br>\
otherwise than thus: but accord. to SM one says<br>\
also,] ساوعهُ, inf. n. سِوَاعٌ, He hired him, or took<br>\
him as a hireling, for the hour. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اساعهُ He left to himself, or itself, left alone,<br>\
or neglected, and lost, or destroyed, him, or it.<br>\
(K.) Er-Rághib says, [but why, I do not well<br>\
see,] that the meaning of neglecting, or the like, is<br>\
imagined as derived from السَّاعَةُ. (TA.) You say,<br>\
أَسَعْتُ الإِبِلَ I left the camels to themselves, left<br>\
them alone, or neglected them. (S.) And رُبَّ<br>\
نَاقَةٍ تُسِيعُ وَلَدَهَا حَتَّى تَأْكُلَهُ السِّبَاعُ, meaning<br>\
[Scarce, or many, a she-camel] leaves to itself, or<br>\
leaves alone, or neglects, her young one [so that<br>\
the beasts of prey devour it]. (TA.) [See also 4<br>\
in art. سيع.]<br>\
-A2-  أَسْوَعَ He (a man, Zj) passed from<br>\
سَاعَة to سَاعَة [i. e. time to time, or hour to hour];<br>\
(Zj, K;) as also اساع, inf. n. إِسَاعَةٌ: (Zj, TA:)<br>\
or he remained behind, or held back, or delayed,<br>\
for a سَاعَة [i. e. a time, or an hour]. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
سَاعٌ: see سَاعَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
سَوْعٌ and ↓ سُوَاعٌ i. q. هدْءٌ, as used in the phrase,<br>\
جَآءَنَا بَعْدَ سَوْعٍ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ [He came to us after a<br>\
period, or portion, of the night; or after about a<br>\
third or fourth part of the night had elapsed,<br>\
when men were asleep, or at rest, and the night,<br>\
and the foot of the passenger, were still; or after<br>\
a third part of the night]: (S, K: *) or this<br>\
phrase means he come to us after a سَاعَة [i. e. a<br>\
short period, or an hour,] of the night. (TA.).<br>\
سَاعَةٌ [An hour;] one of the divisions of the<br>\
night and the day; (Lth, K, TA;) both of which<br>\
together consist of four and twenty of those divisions; each of them, when they are of equal<br>\
length, consisting of twelve such divisions; (TA;)<br>\
[also termed سَاعَةٌ فَلَكِيَّةٌ (an astronomical hour;<br>\
fifteen دَرَجَات of time; sixty minutes of time;)<br>\
because ساعة alone is often used in a vague<br>\
sense, as meaning what is termed سَاعَةٌ زَمَانِيَّةٌ;<br>\
i. e.] a time of night or of day: but used absolutely<br>\
by the Arabs as meaning a time; a while; a<br>\
space, or period; an indefinite [short] time; and<br>\
a little while; (Msb;) a [short or] little portion,<br>\
or division, [or space, or period,] of the night and<br>\
of the day: (TA:) and السَّاعَةُ signifies the pre-<br>\
sent time: (S, K:) pl. سَاعَاتٌ and ↓ سَاعٌ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) [or the latter is rather a coll. gen. n. of which<br>\
ساعة is the n. un.,] and سِوَاعٌ. (Msb.) It is used<br>\
unrestricted in the Kur [vii. 32 and in other<br>\
places], where it is said, لَا يَسْتَأْخِرُونَ سَاعَةً (Msb)<br>\
They will not remain behind (Bd) for a time, or<br>\
any while, (Msb,) or the shortest time: or they<br>\
shall not seek to remain behind, by reason of<br>\
intense terror. (Bd.) And so in a trad., where<br>\
it is said, مَنْ رَاحَ فِى السَّاعَةِ الأُولَى Whoso goeth<br>\
in the first time; not in the first astronomical<br>\
ساعة, for then it would necessarily mean that he<br>\
who should come in the latter part thereof would<br>\
be on a par with the former person, which is not<br>\
the case. (Msb.) [سَاعَةً signifies, as shown above,<br>\
For, or during, an hour: and awhile; for a<br>\
little while; during a short time; as in the<br>\
phrase,] جَلَسْتُ عِنْدَكَ سَاعَةً I sat with thee, or at<br>\
thine abode, for a little while, or during a short<br>\
time. (TA.) [And فِى سَاعَةٍ, In a short time:<br>\
in a moment. And السَّاعَةَ, Now: just now: this<br>\
moment. And سَاعَتَئِذٍ, Then; at that time: or in<br>\
that hour.] And مُذْ سَاعَةٌٍ [A little while ago;]<br>\
in the first time near to us: (K in art. انف:) or<br>\
this signifies السَّاعَةَ [expl. above]. (Zj, T and M<br>\
in art. انف.) [And مِنْ سَاعَتِهِ At the moment<br>\
thereof; instantly. Hence, سَمَّ سَاعَةٍ An instantaneous poison.] ―<br>\
-b2-  السَّاعَةُ also signifies (tropical:)  The resurrection; (S, K, TA;) the raising of mankind<br>\
for the reckoning; also termed السَّاعَةُ الكُبْرَى:<br>\
(Er-Rághib, B:) or the time thereof: (K:) because of the quickness with which its reckoning<br>\
will be accomplished: (TA:) or because it will<br>\
come suddenly upon mankind, in a moment, and<br>\
all creatures will die at one cry. (Zj, Az, TA.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [liv. 1], اِقْتَرَبَتِ السَّاعَةُ (tropical:)  The<br>\
resurrection [or the time thereof] hath drawn<br>\
nigh. (Jel, TA.) And [in vii. 186 and lxxix. 42,]<br>\
يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ (tropical:)  They ask thee concerning the<br>\
resurrection [or the time thereof]. (Bd, Jel,<br>\
TA.) And [in xxxi. last verse and xliii. 85,]<br>\
عِنْدَهُ عِلْمُ السَّاعَةِ (tropical:)  With Him is the knowledge<br>\
of the resurrection, (TA,) or of the time thereof.<br>\
(Bd, Jel.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The death of one generation; termed, for distinction, السَّاعَةُ الوُسْطَى: as<br>\
in the saying of Mohammad, when he saw &#39;AbdAllah Ibn-Uneys, إِنْ يَطُلْ عُمْرُ هٰذَا الغُلَامِ لَمْ يَمُتْ<br>\
حَتَّى تَقُومَ السَّاعَةُ (assumed tropical:)  [If the life of this boy last<br>\
long, he will not die until the death of the generation shall come to pass]: accordingly it is said<br>\
that he was the last that died of the Companions.<br>\
(Er-Rághib, B.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The death of any<br>\
man; termed, for distinction, السَّاعَةُ الصُّغْرَى: as<br>\
in the Kur [vi. 31], قَدْ خَسِرَ الَّذَينَ كَذَّبُوا بِلِقَآءِ<br>\
اللّٰهِ حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَتْهُمُ السَّاٰعَةُ بَغْتَةً (assumed tropical:)  [They have<br>\
suffered loss who disbelieved in, or denied as false,<br>\
the meeting with God until, when death came to<br>\
them suddenly]. (Er-Rághib, B) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Difficulty, distress, or affliction; and so ↓ السَّاعُ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  Distance, or remoteness. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also سَائِعٌ.<br>\
سَاعَةٌ سَوْعَآءُ A severe, grievous, or distressing<br>\
[hour or time]; (S, K;) like the phrase لَيْلَةٌ<br>\
لَيْلَآءُ. (S.)<br>\
سُوَاعٌ: see سَوْعٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also, (S, K, [in the CK<br>\
erroneously without tenween,]) and سَوَاعٌ, (Kh,<br>\
K,) A certain idol (S, K) which belonged to the<br>\
people of Noah, (S,) in whose time it was worshipped; then the deluge buried it, but Iblees exhumed it, and it was worshipped [again]; (K;)<br>\
so says Lth; (TA;) then it became the property<br>\
of [the tribe of] Hudheyl, (S, K,) and was at<br>\
Ruhát, (S,) and pilgrimage was performed to it:<br>\
(S, K:) or it belonged to [the tribe of] Hemdán:<br>\
(Bd, TA:) Abu-l-Mundhir says, I have not heard<br>\
the mention of it in the poems of Hudheyl: but<br>\
one of the Arabs, in verse, mentions Hudheyl as<br>\
paying devotion to it: (TA:) it is said that it<br>\
had the form of a woman: (Har p. 362:) [if so,<br>\
as a fem. proper name, it would be without tenween: but] it is mentioned in the Kur [lxxi. 22,<br>\
and is there with tenween]. (TA.) [See also وَدٌّ.]<br>\
هُوَ ضَائِعٌ سَائِعٌ He is left to himself, left alone,<br>\
or neglected. (S, * K, * TA.) ↓ سَاعَةٌ [is pl. of<br>\
سَائِعٌ; and also signifies] In a state of perdition<br>\
or destruction; perishing; or dying; in a pl.<br>\
sense; like جَاعَةٌ as signifying جِيَاعٌ, (K,) and<br>\
طَاعَةٌ as signifying مُطِيعُونَ. (TA.)<br>\
مُسِيعٌ: see the following paragraph.<br>\
مِسْيَاعٌ A she-camel that leaves her young one<br>\
so that the beasts of prey devour it: (Sh, K:) or<br>\
a she-camel that goes away in the place of pasturing: (S:) belonging to this art. and to art. سيع,<br>\
q. v. (K.) You say also, رَجُلٌ مِضْيَاعٌ مِسْيَاعٌ لِلْمَالِ<br>\
[A man who is wont to neglect the camels or the<br>\
like; or to leave them to themselves, or alone; or<br>\
to lose them]; and accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, مُضِيعٌ<br>\
↓ مُسِيعٌ. (S.)<br>\
