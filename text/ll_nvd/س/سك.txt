TA,) i. q. سَدَّهُ [i. e. He closed or closed up, or he<br>\
stopped or stopped up, or repaired, and made<br>\
firm or strong, the thing]. (K, * TA.) [In the<br>\
place of سَدُّالشَّىْءِ, the explanation of the inf. n.<br>\
accord. to the reading in the TA, we find in the<br>\
CK شَدُّ الشَّىْءِ: and it seems that شَدَّهُ is a correct<br>\
meaning of سَكَّهُ; for it is said that] from مَسْكُوكٌ<br>\
as signifying مَشْدُودٌ is the post-classical phrase<br>\
سَكُّ الأَبْوَابِ [i. e. The making fast of doors].<br>\
(TA.) [In the present day, سَكَّ البَابَ, aor. and<br>\

(K, TA,) He cast forth what was in his belly;<br>\
(K, * TA;) muted, or dunged; (TA;) said of an<br>\
ostrich: (K, TA:) and so سَجَّ. (TA.) And سَكَّ<br>\
بِسَلْحِهِ, (AA, TA,) inf. n. as above, (K, TA,)<br>\
He cast forth his excrement, or ordure, (AA, K,<br>\
TA,) in a thin state; (AA, * K, TA;) as also زَكَّ,<br>\
(AA, TA,) and هَكَّ. (TA.) And هُوَ يَسُكُّ, inf. n.<br>\
as above, He voids thin excrement or ordure;<br>\
(As, S, TA;) as also يَسُجُّ, inf. n. سَجٌّ. (As, TA.)<br>\
And أَخَذَهُ سَكُّ [He was taken with a looseness of<br>\
the bowels;] he had thin evacuations of the bowels;<br>\
expl. by قَعَدَ مَقَاعِدَ رِقَاقًا: and أَخَذَهُ سَكٌّ فِى بَطْنِهِ<br>\
[signifies the same; or] his bowels became loose;<br>\
as also سَجٌّ; so says Yaakoob; and he asserts it<br>\
to be formed by substitution; but which of the<br>\
two is so formed is unknown. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سَكَّ<br>\
فِى الأَرْضِ He went at random in the land, or<br>\
country, not knowing whither to go, and was<br>\
perplexed. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O. [See also 7.]) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
One says also, أَيْنَ تَسُكُّ Whither goest thou?<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  مَا سَكَّ سَمْعِى مِثْلُ ذٰلِكَ الكَلَامِ<br>\
The like of that speech has not entered my ear,<br>\
or ears: and فِى مَسَامِعِى مِثْلُهُ ↓ مَااسْتَكَّ The<br>\
like of it has not entered my ears. (TA.)<br>\

قَطًا means Their going at random, and depressing<br>\
their breasts, after soaring in their flight and<br>\
circling in the air. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\

and made firm or strong; quasi pass. of 1 in the<br>\

وَجَوْبُهَا القَاتِرُ مِنْ سَيرِ اليَلَبْ<br>\
but see يَلَبٌ.]<br>\

its cavity, or interior, (Lth, O,) or from its top<br>\
to its bottom, (AZ, S, O,) or in its aperture; as<br>\
also ↓ سَكٌّ, and ↓ سَكُوكٌ: (K:) or a well even in<br>\
its cavity, or interior, and in its casing: or,<br>\
accord. to Fr, one well, or strongly, or compactly,<br>\
cased, and narrow; the pl. of سُكٌّ is سِكَاكٌ; and<br>\
the pl. of ↓ سَكُوكٌ is سُكٌّ, so that the latter is both<br>\

&#39;Abbád, S, O, K,) in the dial. of the BenooAsad; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O;) and of the spider, (O,<br>\

-A2-  Also A sort of perfume, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) prepared from رَامَك [q. v.], (K,) or from<br>\
musk and رَامَك, (O,) the former being bruised, or<br>\
pounded, sifted, kneaded with water, and wrung<br>\
hard, and wiped over with oil of the خِيرِىّ<br>\
[q. v.] in order that it may not stick to the<br>\
vessel, and left for a night; then musk is pounded,<br>\
or powdered, (يُسْحَقُ,) and put into it by degrees,<br>\
and it is [again] wrung hard, and cut into small,<br>\
round, flat pieces, and left for two days, after<br>\
which it is perforated with a large needle, and<br>\
strung upon a hempen string, and left for a year;<br>\
and as it becomes old, its odour becomes the more<br>\
sweet. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  Also pl. of أَسَكُّ. (K.)<br>\
سِكَّةٌ A ploughshare; i. e. the iron thing with<br>\
which the ground is ploughed; (S, TA;) the iron<br>\
appertenance of the plough. (K.) Hence the<br>\
trad., مَا دَخَلَتِ السِّكَّةُ دَارَ قَوْمِ إِلَّا ذَلُّوا [The ploughshare enters not the abode of a people, or party,<br>\

are stamped, (S, * Msb,) or upon which pieces of<br>\
money (دَرَاهِم) are struck: (K:) pl. سِكَكٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, because stamped therewith, A<br>\
coined dirhem, and deenár; (TA;) which latter<br>\

(طَرِيقَةٌ مُصْطَفَّةٌ, S, O, Msb, or سَطْرٌ, K, or سَطْرٌ<br>\
مَصْطَفٌّ, TA) of palm-trees. (S, O, Msb, K, TA.)<br>\
Hence their saying, (S,) or the saying of the<br>\
Prophet, (O,) خَيْرُ المَالِ مُهْرَةٌ مَأْمُورَةٌ أَوْ سِكَّةٌ مَأْبُورَةٌ,<br>\
(S, in the O سكّة مأبورة او مهرة مأمورة,) meaning<br>\
[The best of property is] a prolific filly (TA) or<br>\
a row of palm-trees fecundated: (S, TA:) or,<br>\
accord. to As, سكّة مأبورة here signifies a ploughshare properly prepared [for ploughing]; and,<br>\
he says, the meaning is, that the best of property<br>\
is a brood [of a mare] or seed-produce. (S.) [It<br>\
has been suggested to me that, if طريقة in the<br>\
explanation above have the signification here<br>\
assigned to it, the epithet مصطفّة is redundant; and therefore that طريقة alone may be the<br>\
proper explanation, and may mean in this case,<br>\
as it does in many others, a tall palm-tree, or the<br>\
tallest of palm-trees, or a smooth palm-tree, or a<br>\
palm-tree the head of which is reached by the<br>\
hand; and that مصطفّة may have been added in<br>\
consequence of misunderstanding, and سطر substituted for طريقة for the same reason: but I<br>\
think it much more probable that the epithet has<br>\
been added because طريقة is ambiguous; and this<br>\
is confirmed by what here follows.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
زُقَاق [meaning street]: (S, O, * Msb:) or [rather]<br>\
a wide زُقَاق: (Msb:) or an even road, (K, TA,)<br>\
[or street,] of such as are termed أَزِقَّة [pl. of زُقَاق]:<br>\
(TA:) so called because the houses therein form<br>\
a row or rows [on either side]; (O, TA;) being<br>\
likened to a سِكَّة of palm-trees: (TA:) [in the<br>\
present day, often applied to a highway, and to<br>\
any road:] pl. سِكَكٌ [as above]: (O:) and<br>\
↓ سَكَائِكُ is syn. with [سِكَكٌ as meaning] أَزِقَّةٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also, app., one says,] اِجْعَلِ<br>\
الأَمْرَ سِكَّةً وَاحِدَةً (assumed tropical:)  Make thou the affair, or case,<br>\
[uniform, or] one uniform thing. (Fr, TA in art.<br>\

steady, by reason of hastiness of temper. (Ibn-<br>\

a beast of the post, or messengers on beasts of the<br>\
post: it is likewise called سِكَّةُ البَرِيدِ: see بَرِيدٌ]:<br>\
and أَصْحَابُ السِّكَكِ, occurring in a letter of &#39;Omar<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Abd-El-&#39;Azeez, means the بُرُد [or messengers<br>\
on beasts of the post] who are stationed there to<br>\
be sent on affairs of importance. (Mgh.) سِكَّةُ<br>\
البَرِيدِ is well known [as having the meaning<br>\
assigned to it above: and also as meaning The<br>\
space, or distance, between each station of the<br>\
messengers above mentioned and the station next<br>\
to it: see, again, بَرِيدٌ]. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.)<br>\

Bustards; syn. حُبَارَيَاتٌ. (TA.)<br>\
سُكَاكٌ The air that is next to the clouds, or to<br>\
the higher part, (عَنَان,) of the sky; as also<br>\
↓ سُكَاكَةٌ: (S, K:) or both signify the air, or<br>\
atmosphere, between heaven and earth: like لُوحٌ:<br>\
the pl. of the second is سَكَائِكُ. (TA.) Hence<br>\
the saying, لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ وَلَو نَزَوَْتَ فِىالسُّكَاكِ,<br>\
meaning [I will not do that even if thou leap]<br>\

in one row: (Th, K:) and said with ش, [i. e.<br>\
شِكَاكًا,] accord. to IAar: (TA:) but Th says<br>\
that it is only with س, deriving it from سِكَّةٌ signifying “a wide زُقَاق.” (TA in art. شك.)<br>\
