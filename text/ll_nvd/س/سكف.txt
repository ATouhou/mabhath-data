مَا سَكِفْتُ البَابَ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K, TA,) and<br>\
بَابَهُ, (TA in art, عتب,) aor.<br>\
سَكَفَ, (K,) I did not<br>\
tread, or have not trodden, upon the threshold<br>\
of the door, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K, TA,) and of his<br>\
door; (TA;) as also ↓ ما تَسَكَّفْتُهُ: (K:) and<br>\
لَهُ بَابًا ↓ لَا أَتَسَكَّفُ [I will not tread upon the<br>\
threshold of a door of his; or] I will not enter a<br>\
house, or chamber, of his. (Z, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسكف, (inf. n. إِسْكَافٌ, Msb,) He was, or<br>\
became, an إِسْكَاف [q. v. infrà]. (IAar, T, Msb, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَسَكَّفَ see 1, in two places.<br>\
سِكَافَةٌ The craft, or handicraft, of the إِسْكَاف<br>\
[q. v.]: (K:) termed by Lth an inf. n., the source<br>\
of الإِسْكَافُ, having no [unaugmented] verb. (TA.)<br>\
سَكَّافٌ: see إِسْكَافٌ.<br>\
سَاكِفٌ The lintel of a door, in which turns the<br>\
صَائِر, (O, K, TA,) this latter word meaning [the<br>\
upper and] the lower extremity of the door, the<br>\
upper of which turns [in a socket in the lintel,<br>\
and the lower in a socket in the threshold]: so<br>\
says En-Nadr. (O, TA. [The explanation of<br>\
صَائِرٌ in the O seems to have been mutilated by a<br>\
copyist, and requires the additions which I have<br>\
made, according to modern usage.])<br>\
سَيْكَفٌ: see إِسْكَافٌ.<br>\
أَسْكَفٌ: see إِسْكَافٌ, in two places.<br>\
أُسْكُفُّ العَيْنَيْنِ The parts on which grow the<br>\
eyelashes of the two eyes: (IAar, K:) or the<br>\
lower eyelids. (Z, K.)<br>\
أُسْكُفَّةٌ The threshold of a door, (S, O, K,) upon<br>\
which one treads; (O, K;) as also ↓ أُسْكُوفَةٌ:<br>\
(TA:) or the lintel of a door: and sometimes [or<br>\
rather almost universally] used in the former<br>\
sense, which is the only meaning mentioned in<br>\
the T [and] in the Abridgment of the &#39;Eyn [and<br>\
in most other lexicons]: pl, اسكاف [app. أَسْكَافٌ,<br>\
and, if so, anomalous]. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The خرقة<br>\
[i. e. خِرْقَة, or rag, or ragged garment, or perhaps<br>\
it is a mistranscription for حِرْفَة, i. e. craft, or<br>\
handicraft, like سِكَافَةٌ,] of the إِسْكَاف: extr.: on<br>\
the authority of Fr. (TA.)<br>\
إِسْكَافٌ (Sh, S, M, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ أُسْكُوفٌ<br>\
(Sh, S, M, K) and ↓ أَسْكَفٌ and ↓ سَكَّافٌ and ↓ سَيْكَفٌ<br>\
(K) A maker of boots, (Sh, Msb, K,) or of shoes<br>\
or sandals; (MA;) or a sewer of boots &amp;c.:<br>\
(Msb;) or the first word, (Msb, K, TA,) as used<br>\
by the Arabs [of the desert], (Msb, TA,) any<br>\
artificer, or artisan, (Msb, K, TA,) thus expl.<br>\
in the M, and so its three [perhaps a mistake for<br>\
four] dial. vars., but said by J [in the S] to be a<br>\
meaning not known, (TA,) except the maker of<br>\
boots, for he is called ↓ أَسْكَفٌ, (K, TA,) i. e. when<br>\
they mean such as is called إِسْكَافٌ in the cities or<br>\
towns or villages: (TA:) or a carpenter; (K;)<br>\
in which sense it is used by Esh-Shemmákh, but<br>\
J says, [in the S,] only on the ground of supposition; (TA;) and any handicraftsman who works<br>\
with an iron tool: (AA, K, * TA:) pl. أَسَاكِفَةٌ<br>\
(S, Msb, TA) [and أَسَاكِيفُ]. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also the first<br>\
word, Skilful with an affair. (O, K.) Sh says,<br>\
I heard El-Fak&#39;asee say, إِنَّكَ لإِسْكَافٌ بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ,<br>\
meaning Verily thou art skilful with this affair.<br>\
(O.)<br>\
-A2-  Accord. to Ibn-&#39;Abbád, الإِسْكَافُ is also<br>\
used (O, K) by Ibn-Mukbil (O) as meaning The<br>\
redness of wine: but this is a mistranscription,<br>\
(O, K,) and a perversion of the meaning: (O:)<br>\
the right word is الإِسْكَاب. (O, K.)<br>\
أَسْكُوفٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
أُسْكُوفَةٌ: see أُسْكُفَّةٌ.<br>\
