السَّبَلِ is expl. in the M,] resembling a film, as<br>\
though it were the web of a spider, with red<br>\

or, accord. to Az, it signifies, with the Arabs, the<br>\
fore part of the beard, and what hangs down<br>\
thereof, or therefrom, upon the breast: or, accord.<br>\
to IDrd, some of them apply it to the extremity<br>\

K,) [to which ة is sometimes added, agreeably<br>\
with a common license, as appears from an ex. in<br>\
what follows,] and سَبَلَاتٌ, occurring in the saying, إِنَّهُ لَذُو سَبَلَاتٍ, mentioned by Lh, in which<br>\
the term سَبَلَة is made to apply to every separate<br>\
portion [so that the meaning is, Verily he has a<br>\
سَبَلَة]. (M.) One says, of enemies, هُمْ صُهْبُ<br>\
السِّبَالِ (assumed tropical:)  [They are red, or reddish, in respect of<br>\
the mustaches, &amp;c.: see art. صهب]. (TA.) And<br>\
of a man who has come threatening, one says,<br>\
جَآءَ فُلَانٌ وَ قَدْ نَشَرَ سَبَلَتَهُ (tropical:)  [Such a one came<br>\
having spread out his mustache, &amp;c.]. (K, * TA.)<br>\
And in a trad. respecting Dhu-th-Thudeiyeh, [see<br>\

for مَنْحَرِهِ.]) You say لَتَبَ فِى سَبَلَةِ النَّاقَةِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He stabbed, or stuck, the she-camel in the<br>\
part above mentioned: (M in art. لتب: [in the<br>\
K, in the present art., كَتَبَ is erroneously put, in<br>\
this phrase, in the place of لَتَبَ:]) Az heard an<br>\
Arab of the desert say لَتَمَ فِى سَبَلَةِ بَعِيرِهِ, [which<br>\
means the same as لَتَبَ,] and he supposes the<br>\
سَبَلَة to be hairs in the part above mentioned.<br>\
(TA.) You say also, بَعِيرٌ حَسَنُ السَّبَلَةِ, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [A camel goodly in respect of] the thinness of<br>\
his skin (جِلْدِهِ): so in the O and K: but accord.<br>\

the right explanation. (TA.)<br>\

fem. by the people of El-Hijáz, and masc. by<br>\

(IAth, TA;) in the Kur it is made masc. in<br>\
vii. 143, and fem. in xii. 108: (S, M, TA:) pl.<br>\
سُبُلٌ, (M, K,) or, accord. to ISk, it has this pl.<br>\
when masc., and سُبُولٌ, like عُنُوقٌ when fem.,<br>\
(Msb, [but this distinction and the latter pl. are<br>\
both strange,]) and it has also as a pl. [of pauc.]<br>\
أَسْبِلَةٌ. (TA.) In the saying, وَ عَلَى اللّٰهِ قَصْدُ السَّبِيلِ<br>\
[And upon God it rests to show the right way<br>\
(see art. قصد)], (M, K,) in the Kur [xvi. 9],<br>\

son of the road; (M, K;) he whom the road has<br>\

has become cut short [so that he is unable to continue his journey]; (M, K;) to which has been<br>\
added, who desires to return to his country, or<br>\
town, and finds not what will suffice him: (TA:)<br>\
or the traveller who is cut off from his property:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) or the person who desires to go to<br>\
a country, or town, other than his own, for a<br>\
necessary affair: or, accord. to Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, the<br>\
guest who has become disabled from proceeding in<br>\
his journey, his means having failed him: to such<br>\
should be given as much as will suffice him to<br>\
his home. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  تَقْطَعُونَ السَّبِيلَ, in the Kur<br>\
[xxix. 28], means (assumed tropical:)  [And ye cut off] the way of<br>\

-b4-  [سَبِيلُ<br>\
اللّٰهِ means (assumed tropical:)  The way, or cause, of God, or of<br>\
religion; or the way whereby one seeks approach<br>\
to God, or advancement in his favour.] It is said<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  And expend ye in warring against unbelievers<br>\
and the like, and in every good work commanded<br>\
by God; (M, K;) such being of the ways [that<br>\
lead] to God: (M:) mostly used in relation<br>\
to warring against unbelievers and the like.<br>\
(M, K.) And in the same, iii. 163, الَّذِينَ قُتِلُوا<br>\
فِى سَبِيلِ اللّٰهِ, meaning [Who have been slain in<br>\
the cause of God, or of his religion, i. e.,] for the<br>\
sake of the religion of God. (Jel.) And you say,<br>\
جَعَلَ ضَيْعَتَهُ فِى سَبِيلِ اللّٰهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He made his estate<br>\
to have its profit, or revenue, or usufruct, employed in the cause of God, or of religion]. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  سَبِيلٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A means of access; a<br>\
connexion, or a tie: so in the saying, in the<br>\
Kur [xxv. 29], يَا لَيْتَنِى اتَّخَذْتُ مَعَ الرَّسُولِ سَبِيلًا<br>\
