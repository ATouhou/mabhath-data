[q. v.]: (S, * K:) or he decided judicially, and<br>\
recorded his sentence in the سِجِلّ: (Msb:) and<br>\
Mtr says that ↓ إِسْجَالٌ may be syn. with تَسْجِيلٌ,<br>\
signifying the writing of سِجِلَّات [pl. of سِجِلٌّ],<br>\
though not found by him in the lexicons: (Har<br>\
p. 473:) [but I have found it, for Sgh says,] the<br>\
إِسْجَال of the kádee and his تَسْجِيل are one [in<br>\
meaning]. (O.) You say, سجّل بِهِ He decided<br>\
it judicially, [and recorded it in the سِجِلّ;] or<br>\
he decreed it decisively; so expl. by the Shereef:<br>\
or, as in the &#39;Ináyeh, he established it and recorded it [in the سِجِلّ]. (TA.) And سجّل القَاضِى<br>\
لِفُلَانٍ بِمَالِهِ The kádee secured to such a one his<br>\
property [by a judicial decision recorded in the<br>\
سِجِلّ]. (TA.) And سجّل عَلَيْهِ القَاضِى [The<br>\
kadee decided judicially against him, and recorded<br>\

(S, IB, * K;) doing like as he did; (S, IB;)<br>\
originally in the drawing of water; (S, * IB;)<br>\
each of them bringing forth in his سَجْل [or<br>\
bucket] the like of what the other brought forth<br>\
[or endeavouring to do so]; the one, of them, that<br>\

فُلَانًا (tropical:)  Such a one vies with such a one, each of<br>\
them producing, [of the evidences] of nobility, the<br>\
like of what the other produces; the one, of them,<br>\

&#39;Abbás Ibn-&#39;Otbeh Ibn-Abee-Lahab says,<br>\
مَنْ يُسَاجِلْنِى يُسَاجِلْ مَاجِدًا<br>\
يَمْلَأُ الدَّلْوَ إِلَى عَقْدِ الكَرَبْ<br>\
[He who contends for superiority with me contends for superiority with one possessing glory,<br>\
who fills the bucket to the tying of the rope that<br>\
is attacked to the middle of its cross-bars]: and<br>\
hence the saying, الحَرْبُ سِجَالٌ. (S. [See سَجْلٌ.])<br>\
4<br>\
اسجلهُ He gave him a bucketful (سَجْلًا) or<br>\
two bucketfuls (سَجْلَيْنِ): (K:) or, as some say,<br>\

مَعَ أُمِّهَا The beast was sent forth, or set loose or<br>\
free, with its mother. (TA.) It is said in a<br>\

your cattle in men&#39;s fields of seed-produce. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And you say, اسجل النَّاسَ He left, or left<br>\

-b5-  And اسجل لَهُمُ الأَمْرَ<br>\

man. (Msb.) ―<br>\

6<br>\
تساجلوا They vied, competed, or contended<br>\
for superiority, one with another; emulated, or<br>\
rivalled, one another; or imitated one another;<br>\
[originally, in the drawing of water: and hence,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  in other things: (see 3:)] (S, TA:) and هُمَا<br>\
يَتَسَاجَلَانِ They two vie, &amp;c., each with the<br>\
other. (K.)<br>\
7<br>\
انسجل It (water) poured out, or forth; or<br>\
became poured out, or forth; (S, K;) [app., continuously: see 1.]<br>\
سَجْلٌ A full bucket: so accord. to Az and ElFárábee and others: (MS:) or a bucket containing water, whether little or much: such as is<br>\
empty is not called سَجْلٌ nor ذَنُوبٌ: (S:) or a<br>\
great bucket: (Msb: [see also سَجِيلٌ:]) or a<br>\
great bucket that is full (K, TA) of water: (TA:)<br>\
and a bucketful; the quantity that fills a bucket:<br>\
(K:) it is of the masc. gender [though دَلْوٌ (the<br>\
most common word for “ a bucket ”) is generally<br>\
fem.]: (S, K:) pl. سِجَالٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A share, or portion; (Msb;) like دَلَاةٌ [which<br>\
likewise originally signifies “ a bucket ”]. (S in<br>\
art. دلو. [See also سَجِيلٌ.]) And hence is derived<br>\
the saying, الحَرْبُ سِجَالٌ, [as though meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  War is an affair of shares, or portions;] i. e.<br>\
the victory in war is shared by turns among the<br>\
people [engaged therein]: (Msb:) [but it is implied in the S that it is from المُسَاجَلَةُ, and that<br>\
سِجَالٌ is here an inf. n. like مُسَاجَلَةٌ, agreeably<br>\
with analogy; and if so, the saying may be<br>\
rendered war is a contention for superiority:<br>\
(see 3:)] or the saying الحَرْبُ بَيْنَهُمْ سِجَالٌ means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [War between them consists of portions, in such<br>\
a manner that] a سَجْل [or portion] thereof is<br>\
against these, and another is against these: (K:)<br>\
originating from the act of two men drawing<br>\
water with two buckets from a well, each of<br>\
them having [in his turn] a full bucket. (TA.)<br>\
You say also, أَعْطَاهُ سَجْلَهُ مِنْ كَذَا (tropical:)  He gave<br>\
him his share, or portion, of such a thing; like<br>\
as one says, ذَنُوبَهُ. (Har p. 19.) The phrase سَجْلٌ<br>\
↓ سَجِيلٌ in the saying لَهُمْ مِنَ المَجْدِ سَجْلٌ سَجِيلٌ<br>\
(K, * TA) has an intensive signification; (K,<br>\
TA;) [the saying app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  They have, of<br>\
glory, a large share.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence likewise, metaphorically applied to signify (tropical:)  A gift: one says<br>\
جَوَادٌ عَظِيمُ السَّجْلِ (tropical:)  [A bountiful man who is<br>\
large in gift]. (Har ibid. [The first word in this<br>\
saying is there written جوّاد.]) One says also,<br>\
لَهُ بِرٌّ فَائِضُ السِّجَالِ (assumed tropical:)  [He has overflowing goodness or beneficence]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A bountiful man. (Abu-l-&#39; Omeythil, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
great udder: pl. سِجَالٌ and سُجُولٌ. (K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also سِجِلٌّ, in two places.<br>\
سِجْلٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
سِجِلٌّ A writing; or paper, or piece of skin,<br>\
written upon; (K, * TA;) as also سُجُلٌّ (TA)<br>\
and ↓ سِجْلٌ (K, TA) [and ↓ سَجْلٌ, as appears<br>\
from what follows]: or a طُومَار [meaning a roll,<br>\
or scroll, or the like,] for writing upon or written<br>\
upon: (Bd in xxi. 104:) and a written statement<br>\
of a contract and the like; (K, TA;) i. e. (TA)<br>\
i. q. صَكٌّ: (S, TA: [but see this word, which has<br>\
also other meanings, and among them that here<br>\
following, which is the most common meaning of<br>\
سِجِلٌّ:]) the record of a kádee, or judge, in<br>\
which his sentence is written; (Msb;) a judicial<br>\
record: (Mgh:) [see also مَحْضَرٌ:] pl. سِجِلَّاتٌ.<br>\
(Msb, K.) كَطَىِّ السِّجِلِّ لِلْكِتَابِ, in the Kur<br>\
xxi. 104, means Like the folding of the طُومَار<br>\
[expl. above] for the purpose of writing [thereon]:<br>\
or for what is to be written: (Bd:) or upon<br>\
what is written; (Bd, * Jel;) i. e., upon the<br>\
written record [of the works] of the son of Adam at<br>\
his death: (Jel:) or السِّجِلّ here has the third of<br>\
the meanings here following: (Bd, Jel:] or the<br>\
second thereof. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A writer, or<br>\
scribe: (K:) and so some explain it in the verse<br>\

scribe of the Prophet. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A certain<br>\

[men&#39;s] works. (Bd ubi suprà.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And, without<br>\
the article, A man, in the Abyssinian language.<br>\
(K.) In the verse cited above, I&#39; Ab read ↓ السَّجْلِ,<br>\
and explained it as meaning A certain man: but<br>\
it is also said to mean a certain angel: and another reading is السُّجُلِّ, a dial. var. mentioned<br>\
above. (TA.)<br>\
السِّجَالُ a name for The ewe. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And سِجَال سِجَال [i. e. سِجَالْ سِجَالْ, so in<br>\
my MS. copy of the K, but in the CK سِجالِ<br>\
سِجالِ,] is A call to the ewe to be milked. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
سَجُولٌ A she-goat abounding in milk: thus<br>\
correctly, as in the O: in the copies of the K, in<br>\
the place of عَنْزٌ is put عَيْنٌ [making the meaning<br>\
to be a spring abounding in water or an eye<br>\
abounding in tears]. (TA.)<br>\
سَجِيلٌ, applied to a bucket (دَلْو), Large, or<br>\

the measure فَعِيلٌ from سَجْلٌ meaning “ a full<br>\
bucket ” [and likewise “ a share, or portion ”];<br>\
but, he adds, it does not please me. (TA.)<br>\
سَجَالَةٌ, in a testicle, Flaccidity and wideness<br>\
in the scrotum. (K.)<br>\
سَجِيلَةٌ: see سَجِيلٌ.<br>\
سِجِّيلٌ Stones like lumps of dry, or tough,<br>\
clay: arabicized from سَنْگ وَ گِلْ; (K, TA;) which<br>\
are Pers. words, meaning “ stone and clay; ” the<br>\
conjunction falling out in the arabicizing: (TA:)<br>\
or baked clay: (Jel in xi. 84 and xv. 74 and<br>\
cv. 4:) or stones (S, K) of clay (S) baked by the<br>\
fire of Hell, whereon were inscribed the names<br>\
of the people [for whom they were destined]:<br>\
(S, K:) so in the Kur; as is indicated therein,<br>\
in li. 33 and 34: (S:) or مِنْ سَجِّيلٍ in the Kur<br>\
means مِنْ سِجِلٍّ, i. e. of what had been written<br>\
[or decreed] for them, that they should be punished<br>\
therewith; and سِجِّيل means the same as سِجِّين,<br>\
mentioned and expl. in the Kur lxxxiii. 8 and 9:<br>\
(K:) AO says that من سجّيل means many and<br>\
hard; and that سِجِّينٌ is syn. with سِجِّيلٌ in this<br>\
sense: (TA:) it is also said to be from سِجِّينٌ<br>\
meaning Hell; the ن being changed into ل:<br>\
(Bd in xi. 84:) also, to be from أَسْجَلْتُهُ meaning “ I sent forth him or it: ” or from أَسْجَلْتُ<br>\

إِلَّا الْإِحْسَانُ [Shall the recompense of doing good<br>\
be other than doing good?], هِىَ مُسْجَلَةٌ لِلْبَرِّ وَ الفَاجِرِ,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  It is unrestricted in its relation to the<br>\
righteous and the unrighteous: a righteous person<br>\
is not made to be conditionally intended thereby,<br>\
exclusively of an unrighteous. (As, S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And one says, فَعَلْنَاهُ وَ الدَّهْرُ مُسْجَلٌ (assumed tropical:)  [We did it<br>\
when fortune was unrestricted], i. e., when no one<br>\
feared any one. (K.)<br>\
