سَحَرَهُ He, or it, hit, or hurt, his سَحْر [or<br>\
lungs, &amp;c.], (Mgh, TA,) or his سُحْرَة [i. e. heart].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And the same, aor.<br>\
سَحَرَ, inf. n. سِحْرٌ, (T,<br>\
TA,) [said to be] the only instance of a pret. and<br>\
aor. and inf. n. of these measures except the verb<br>\
فَعَلَ, aor. يَفْعَلُ, inf. n. فِعْلٌ, (MF,) (tropical:)  He turned<br>\
it, (T,) or him, (TA,) عَنْ وَجْهِهِ [from its, or his,<br>\
course, or way, or manner of being]: and hence<br>\
other significations here following. (T, TA.<br>\
[Accord. to the T, this seems to be proper; but<br>\
accord. to the A, tropical.]) In this sense the<br>\
verb is used in the Kur xxiii. 91. (Fr.) The<br>\
Arabs say to a man, مَا سَحَرَكَ عَنْ وَجْهِ كَذَا وَ كَذَا<br>\
(tropical:)  What has turned thee from such and such a<br>\
course? (Yoo.) أُفِكَ and سُحِرَ are syn. [as meaning (tropical:)  He was turned from his course &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  He turned him from hatred to love.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Hence, (TA,) aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
(T, S, TA,) and inf. n. also سَحْرٌ, (KL, TA,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
enchanted, or fascinated, him, or it; (S, * K, *<br>\
KL, PS;) and so ↓ سحّرهُ (MA, TA) [in an<br>\
intensive or a frequentative sense, meaning he<br>\
enchanted, or fascinated, him, or it, much, or (as<br>\
shown by an explanation of its pass. part. n.)<br>\
time after time]: and سَحَرَ عَيْنَهُ He enchanted, or<br>\
fascinated, his eye. (MA.) You say, سَحَرَ<br>\
الشَّىْءَ عَنْ وَجْهِهِ, meaning (tropical:)  He (an enchanter,<br>\
سَاحِرٌ) apparently turned the thing from its<br>\
proper manner of being, making what was false<br>\
to appear in the form of the true, or real;<br>\
causing the thing to be imagined different from<br>\
what it really was. (T, TA. [See سِحْرٌ, below.])<br>\
And المَرْأَةُ تَسْحَرُ النَّاسَ بِعَيْنِهَا (tropical:)  [The woman enchants, or fascinates, men by her eye]. (A.)<br>\
And سَحَرَهُ بِكَلَامِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He caused him, or enticed<br>\
him, to incline to him by his soft, or elegant,<br>\
speech, and by the beauty of its composition.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (tropical:)  He deceived, deluded, beguiled, circumvented, or outwitted, him; (S, Mgh, K; *)<br>\
as also ↓ سحّرهُ, [but app. in an intensive or a frequentative sense,] (K, TA,) inf. n. تَسْحِيرٌ. (TA.<br>\
[Accord. to the Mgh, the former verb in this<br>\
sense seems to be derived from the same verb in<br>\
the first of the senses expl. in this art.]) ―<br>\
-b6-  And<br>\
in like manner, (assumed tropical:)  He diverted him [with a thing],<br>\
as one diverts a child with food, that he may be<br>\
contented, and not want milk; syn. عَلَّلَهُ; as also<br>\
↓ سحّرهُ, inf. n. تَسْحِيرٌ. (S, TA.) One says,<br>\
سَحَرَهُ بِالطَّعَامِ وَ الشَّرَابِ, and ↓ سحّرهُ, (assumed tropical:)  He fed<br>\
him, and diverted him [from the feeling of want],<br>\
with meat and drink. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And سَحَرْتُ<br>\
الفِضَّةَ (assumed tropical:)  I gilded the silver. (Ham p. 601.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
سِحْرٌ is also syn. with فَسَادٌ [as quasi-inf. n. of<br>\
أَفْسَدَ, as is indicated in the TA; thus signifying<br>\
The act of corrupting, marring, spoiling, &amp;c.:<br>\
see the pass. part. n. مَسْحُورٌ]. (TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
one says, سَحَرَ المَطَرُ الطِّينَ and التُّرَابَ, (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
rain spoiled the clay, and the earth, or dust, so<br>\
that it was not fit for use. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And one<br>\
says of the adhesion of the lungs to the side by<br>\
reason of thirst, يَسْحَرُ أَلْبَانَ الغَنَمِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
causes the milk of the sheep, or goats, to descend<br>\
before bringing forth. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  سَحَرَ also signifies He went, or removed, to a distance, or far<br>\
away; syn. تَبَاعَدَ; (T, K;) said of a man. (T,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A3-  سَحِرَ, aor.<br>\
سَحَرَ, (assumed tropical:)  He went forth early in<br>\
the morning, in the first part of the day; or<br>\
between the time of the prayer of daybreak and<br>\
sunrise; syn. بَكَّرَ. (O, K. [See also 4.])<br>\
2<br>\
سحّر, inf. n. تَسْحِيرٌ: see 1, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also (tropical:)  He fed another, or others, with the food,<br>\
or meal, called the سَحُور: (M, Mgh, TA:) or<br>\
سَحَّرَهُمْ signifies he gave to them the meal so<br>\
called. (Mgh.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسحر (tropical:)  He was, or became, in the time<br>\
called the سَحَر; (S, A, K;) as also ↓ استحر.<br>\
(TA.) And (tropical:)  He went, or journeyed, in the time<br>\
so called: (S, K, TA:) or he rose to go, or journey, in that time; and so ↓ استحر: (TA:) or this<br>\
latter signifies he went forth in that time. (A.<br>\
[See also 1, last sentence.])<br>\
5<br>\
تسحّر (A, Mgh, Msb) and تسحّر السَّحُورَ<br>\
(Az, TA) (tropical:)  He ate the food, or meal, [or drank<br>\
the draught of milk,] called the سَحُور. (Az, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تسحّر بِهِ (tropical:)  He ate it,<br>\
(S, * K, * TA,) namely, food, or سَوِيق [q. v.], [or<br>\
drank it, namely, milk,] at the time called the<br>\
سَحَر. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
استحر: see 4, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
(a cock) crowed at the time called the سَحَر: (S,<br>\
K:) and he (a bird) sang, warbled, or uttered his<br>\
voice, at that time. (TA.)<br>\
سَحْرٌ, and ↓ سَحَرٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) sometimes thus because of the faucial letter, (S,) and<br>\
↓ سُحْرٌ, (S, Msb, K,) and, accord. to El-Khafájee,<br>\
in the &#39;Ináyeh, ↓ سِحْرٌ, but this is not mentioned<br>\
by any other, and therefore requires confirmation,<br>\
(TA,) The lungs, or lights: (S, A, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K:) or what adheres to the gullet and the windpipe, of [the contents of] the upper part of the<br>\
belly: or all that hangs to the gullet, consisting of<br>\
the heart and liver and lungs: (Msb, TA:) and<br>\
the part of the exterior of the body corresponding<br>\
to the place of the lungs: (Mgh, TA: *) and<br>\
سَحْرٌ signifies also the liver; and the core, or<br>\
black or inner part, (سَوَاد,) and sides, or regions,<br>\
of the heart: (TA:) and ↓ سُحْرٌ, the heart; (ElJarmee, K;) as also ↓ سُحْرَةٌ: (TA:) the pl. (of<br>\
سَحْرٌ, S, Msb) is سُحُورٌ, and (of ↓ سُحْرٌ, S, Msb,<br>\
and of ↓ سَحَرٌ, Msb) أَسْحَارٌ. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, اِنْتَفَخَ سَحْرُهُ, (S, A, K,) and اِنْتَفَخَتْ<br>\
↓ مَسَاحِرُهُ, (A, K,) (tropical:)  His lungs became inflated,<br>\
or swollen, by reason of timidity and cowardice:<br>\
(A:) said of a coward: (S:) and of one who has<br>\
exceeded his due bounds: Lth says that, when<br>\
repletion arises in a man, one says انتفخ سحره,<br>\
and that the meaning is, [as given also in the<br>\
K,] he exceeded his due bounds: but Az says that<br>\
this is a mistake, and that this phrase is only said<br>\
of a coward, whose inside is filled with fear, and<br>\
whose lungs are inflated, or swollen, so that the<br>\
heart is raised to the gullet: and of the same<br>\
kind is the phrase in the Kur [xxxiii. 10]<br>\
وَبَلَغَتِ القُلُوبُ الحَنَاجِرَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And المُقَطَّعَةُ<br>\
الأَسْحَارِ, and السُّحُورِ, (assumed tropical:)  [She that has her lungs<br>\
burst asunder], an appellation given to the أَرْنَب<br>\
[i. e. hare, or female hare], (S, K,) or to the<br>\
swift ارنب, (TA in art. قطع,) by way of good<br>\
omen, meaning that her lungs will burst asunder;<br>\
like المُقَطَّعَةُ النِّيَاطِ: (S:) and some (of those of<br>\
later times, S) say المُقَطِّعَةُ, with kesr to the ط;<br>\
(S, K;) as though, by her speed and vehemence<br>\
of running, she would burst asunder her lungs;<br>\
(S;) or because she bursts the lungs of the dogs<br>\
by the vehemence of her running, and the lungs<br>\
of him who purses her. (ISh, Sgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
اِنْقَطَعَ مِنْهُ سَحْرِى (tropical:)  I despaired of him, or it.<br>\
(A, K.) And أَنَا مِنْهُ غَيْرُ صَرِيمِ سَحْرٍ (tropical:)  I am not<br>\
in despair of him, or it. (A, B.) صَرِيمُ سَحْرٍ is<br>\
also expl. as signifying (tropical:)  Having his hope cut<br>\
off: and (tropical:)  anything despaired of. (TA.) And<br>\
صُرِمَ سَحْرُهُ means (tropical:)  His hope was cut off. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The scar of a gall on the back of a<br>\
camel, (K, TA,) when it has healed, and the<br>\
place thereof has become white. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And<br>\
The upper, or highest, part of a valley. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  See also سَحَّارَةٌ.<br>\
-A5-  And see سَحَرٌ, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
سُحْرٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
سِحْرٌ: see سَحْرٌ, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-  [Also] an<br>\
inf. n. of سَحَرَهُ, meaning (tropical:)  The turning a thing<br>\
from its proper manner of being to another<br>\
manner: (T, TA: [accord. to the T, this seems<br>\
to be proper; but accord. to the A, tropical:])<br>\
and hence, (T, TA,) (tropical:)  enchantment, or fascination: (T, * S, * MA, KL, PS:) for when. the<br>\
enchanter (السَّاحِرُ) makes what is false to appear<br>\
in the form of truth, and causes a thing to be<br>\
imagined different from what it really is, it is as<br>\
though he turned it from its proper manner of<br>\
being: (T, TA:) the producing what is false in<br>\
the form of truth: (IF, Msb:) or, in the common<br>\
conventional language of the law, any event of<br>\
which the cause is hidden, and which is imagined<br>\
to be different from what it really is: and embellishment by falsification, and deceit: (Fakhred-Deen, Msb:) or a performance in which one<br>\
allies himself to the devil, and which is effected<br>\
by his aid: (TA:) i. q. أَخْذَةٌ [meaning a kind of<br>\
enchantment, or fascination, which captivates the<br>\
eye and the like, and by which enchantresses<br>\
withhold their husbands from other women]: (S:)<br>\
and anything of which the way of proceeding or<br>\
operation (مَأْخَذُهُ) is subtile: (S, K:) accord. to<br>\
Ibn-Abee-&#39;Áïsheh, سِحْر is thus called by the<br>\
Arabs because it changes health, or soundness, to<br>\
disease: (Sh:) [and in like manner it is said to<br>\
change hatred to love: (see 1:)] pl. أَسْحَارٌ and<br>\
سُحُورٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  Skilful eloquence: (TA:)<br>\
or used absolutely, it is applied to that for which<br>\
the agent is blamed: and when restricted, to that<br>\
which is praiseworthy. (Msb.) Thus it is in the<br>\
saying of Mohammad, إِنَّ مِنَ البَيَانِ لَسِحْرًا<br>\
(tropical:)  [Verily there is a kind of eloquence that is<br>\
enchantment]: because the speaker propounds an<br>\
obscure matter, and discloses its true meaning by<br>\
the beauty of his eloquence, inclining the hearts<br>\
[of his hearers] in like manner as they are inclined<br>\
by سِحْر: or because there is in eloquence a<br>\
novelty and strangeness of composition which<br>\
attracts the hearer and brings him to such a pass<br>\
as almost diverts him from other things; therefore it is likened to سِحْر properly so called: and<br>\
it is said to be السِّحْرُ الحَلَالُ [or lawful enchantment]. (Msb.) The saying of Mohammad mentioned above was uttered on the following<br>\
occasion: Keys Ibn-&#39;Ásim El-Minkaree and EzZibrikán Ibn-Bedr and &#39;Amr Ibn-El-Ahtam came<br>\
to the Prophet, who asked &#39;Amr respecting EzZibrikán; whereupon he spoke well of him: but<br>\
Ez-Zibrikán was not content with this, and said,<br>\
“ By God, O apostle of God, he knows that I<br>\
am more excellent than he has said; but he<br>\
envies the place that I have in thine estimation: ”<br>\
and thereupon &#39;Amr spoke ill of him; and then<br>\
said, “By God, I did not lie of him in the first<br>\
saying nor in the other; but he pleased me, and I<br>\
spoke as pleased; then he angered me, and I<br>\
spoke as angered: ” then Mohammad uttered the<br>\
above-mentioned words. (TA.) Their meaning<br>\
is, but God knows best, he praises the man,<br>\
speaking truth respecting him, so as to turn the<br>\
hearts of the hearers to him, (K,) or to what he<br>\
says; (TA;) and he dispraises him, speaking<br>\
truth respecting him, so as to turn their hearts<br>\
also to him, (K,) or to what he says after. (TA.)<br>\
A&#39; Obeyd says nearly the same. Or, as some say,<br>\
the meaning is, that there is an eloquence that is<br>\
sinful like سِحْر. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  Skill; science:<br>\
Mohammad said, مَنْ تَعَلَّمَ بَابًا مِنَ النُّجُومِ فَقَدْ<br>\
تَعَلَّمَ بَابًا مِنَ السِّحْرِ (tropical:)  [He who learneth a process<br>\
of the science of the stars (meaning astrology or<br>\
astronomy) learneth a process of enchantment],<br>\
which may mean that the science of the stars is<br>\
forbidden to be learned, like the science of enchantment, and that the learning of it is an act of<br>\
infidelity: or it may mean that it is skill, and<br>\
science; referring to what is acquired thereof by<br>\
way of calculation; as the knowledge of eclipses<br>\
of the sun or moon, and the like. (ISd, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
Also (tropical:)  Food; aliment; nutriment: so called because its effect is subtile. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  غَيْثٌ ذُو سِحْرٍ<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  Superabundant rain. (TA.)<br>\
سَحَرٌ: see سَحْرٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also, (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) and ↓ سَحْرٌ, (TA,) and ↓ سُحُرٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) and ↓ سَحَرِىٌّ, and ↓ سَحَرِيَّةٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  The<br>\
time a little before daybreak: (S, K:) or [simply]<br>\
before daybreak: (Msb:) or the last part of the<br>\
night: (Lth, Mgh:) or the last sixth of the night:<br>\
(Mgh:) the pl. of سَحَرٌ (Msb) and of ↓ سَحْرٌ<br>\
(TA) and of ↓ سُحُرٌ, (Msb,) is أَسْحَارٌ: (Msb, K,<br>\
TA:) the سَحَر is thus met. called because it is the<br>\
time of the departure of the night and the coming<br>\
of the day; so that it is the مُتَنَفَّس [lit. the “ time<br>\
of the breathing,” by which is meant the “ shining<br>\
forth,”] of the dawn: (A:) there are two times<br>\
of which each is thus called; one, which is<br>\
[specially] called السَّحَرُ الأَعْلَى, [or the earlier<br>\
سَحَر,] (A, Mgh,) is before daybreak; (Mgh;) or<br>\
a little before daybreak: (A:) and the other, at<br>\
daybreak: (A, Mgh:) like as one says “ the<br>\
false dawn ” and “ the true: ” (A:) the earlier<br>\
سَحَر is also called ↓ سُحْرَةٌ: (S, K:) or the<br>\
سُحْرَة is the same as the سَحَر: or it is the last<br>\
third of the night, to daybreak. (TA.) Using<br>\
سَحَر indeterminately, you make it perfectly decl.,<br>\
and say, أَتَيْتُهُ بِسَحَرٍ [I came to him a little before<br>\
daybreak], agreeably with the phrase in the Kur<br>\
liv. 34; (S;) and in like manner, ↓ بِسُحْرَةٍ [in the<br>\
earlier سَحَر]: (S, K:) you also say سَحَرًا, and<br>\
↓ سُحْرَةً, (A,) and سَحَرًا مِنَ الأَسْحَارِ: and مَا زَالَ<br>\
عِنْدَنَا مُنْذُ السَّحَرِ [He ceased not to be with us, or<br>\
at our abode, from a little before daybreak]: and<br>\
لَقِيتُهُ بِالسَّحَرِ الأَعْلَى, and بِأَعْلَى سَحَرَيْنِ, and<br>\
بِأَعْلَى السَّحَرَيْنِ, (TA,) and فِى أَعْلَى السَّحَرَيْنِ,<br>\
(A, TA,) [I met him in the earlier سَحَر;] but<br>\
بِأَعْلَى سَحَرٍ, a phrase used by El-&#39;Ajjáj, is erroneous: (TA:) and هٰذِهِ اللَّيْلَةِ ↓ لَقِيتُهُ سَحَرِىَّ and<br>\
↓ سَحَرِيَّتَهَا [I met him in the time a little before<br>\
daybreak of this last night]. (TA.) When, by<br>\
سَحَر alone, you mean the سَحَر of the night immediately preceding, you say, لَقِيتُهُ سَحَرَ يَا هٰذَا<br>\
[I met him a little before daybreak this last night,<br>\
O thou man], (S, K,) making it imperfectly decl.<br>\
because it is altered from السَّحَرَ, (S,) or because<br>\
it is for بِالسَّحَرِ; (TA;) and it is thus determinate<br>\
by itself, (S, K,) without its being prefixed to<br>\
another noun and without ال: (S:) and in the<br>\
same sense you say بِسَحَرَ: (TA:) and you say,<br>\
سِرْ عَلَى فَرَسِكَ سَحَرَ يَا فَتَى [Go thou on thy<br>\
horse a little before daybreak this night, O youth:<br>\
so in the TA; but in two copies of the S, for<br>\
سِرْ I find سِيرَ]: you do not make it to terminate<br>\
with damm, [like قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ &amp;c.,] because it is<br>\
an adv. n. which, in a place where it is fitting to<br>\
be such, may not be used otherwise than as such:<br>\
(S:) and [in like manner] you say, ↓ لَقِيتُهُ سُحْرَةَ<br>\
يَا هٰذَا [I met him in the earlier سَحَر of this last<br>\
night, O thou man]. (TA.) If you make سَحَر<br>\
the proper name of a man, it is perfectly decl.:<br>\
and so is the dim.; for it is not of the measure of<br>\
a noun made to deviate from its original from,<br>\
like أُخَرُ: you say, ↓ سِرْ عَلَى فَرَسِكَ سُحَيْرًا [Go<br>\
thou on thy horse a very little before daybreak:<br>\
so in the TA; but here again, in two copies of<br>\
the S, for سِرْ I find سِيرَ]: you do not make it to<br>\
terminate with damm, [like قَبْلُ &amp;c.,] because its<br>\
being made of the dim. form does not bring it<br>\
into the class of adv. ns. which may also be used<br>\
as nouns absolutely, though it does bring it into<br>\
the class of nouns which are perfectly declinable.<br>\
(S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سَحَرٌ also signifies (tropical:)  Whiteness overspreading blackness; (K;) like صَحَرٌ; except that<br>\
the former is mostly used in relation to the time<br>\
so called, of daybreak; and the latter, in relation<br>\
to colours, as when one says حِمَارٌ أَصْحَرُ; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ سُحْرَةٌ signifies the same; (TA;) i. q.<br>\
صُحْرَةٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  The extremity (T, A, K)<br>\
of a desert, (T,) and of the earth or a land, (A,)<br>\
or of anything: (K:) from the time of night so<br>\
called: (A:) pl. أَسْحَارٌ. (T, A, K.)<br>\
سَحِرٌ: see سَحِيرٌ.<br>\
سُحُرٌ: see سَحَرٌ, first sentence, in two places.<br>\
سُحْرَةٌ: see سَحْرٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and سَحَرٌ, in five places.<br>\
سَحَرِىٌّ and سَحَرِيَّةٌ: see سَحَرٌ; each in two<br>\
places.<br>\
سَحُورٌ A meal, or food, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) or<br>\
[particularly] سَوِيق [generally meaning meal of<br>\
parched barley], that is eaten at the time called<br>\
the سَحَر; (S, * Mgh, Msb, K* TA;) or a draught<br>\
of milk that is drunk at that time. (TA.) It is repeatedly mentioned in trads. [relating to Ramadán,<br>\
when the Muslim is required to be exact in the<br>\
time of this meal], and mostly as above; but some<br>\
say that it is correctly [in these cases] with damm,<br>\
[i. e. سُحُور, which see below,] because the blessing and recompense have respect to the action,<br>\
and not to the food. (TA.)<br>\
سُحُورٌ, an inf. n. [without a verb properly belonging to it, or rather a quasi-inf. n., for its<br>\
verb is تَسَحَّرَ], (TA,) The act of eating the meal,<br>\
or food, [or drinking the draught of milk,] called<br>\
the سَحُور [q. v.]. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
سَحِيرٌ: see مَسْحُورٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A man having his<br>\
lungs (سَحْرُهُ) ruptured; and so ↓ سَحِرٌ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And Having a complaint of the belly, (K,<br>\
TA,) from pain of the lungs. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A<br>\
horse large in the belly, (K,) or in the جَوْف<br>\
[which often means the chest]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [And<br>\
An arrow wounding the lungs: so accord. to<br>\
Freytag in the “ Deewán el-Hudhaleeyeen. ”]<br>\
سُحَيْرًا: see سَحَرٌ, in the latter half of the paragraph.<br>\
سُحَارَةٌ The parts, of a sheep or goat, that the<br>\
butcher plucks out (K, TA) and throws away,<br>\
(TA,) consisting of the lungs, or lights, (سَحْر)<br>\
and the windpipe, (K, TA,) and the appendages<br>\
of these. (TA.)<br>\
سَحَّارٌ: see سَاحِرٌ, in two places.<br>\
سَحَّارَةٌ (tropical:)  A certain plaything of children; (A,<br>\
K, TA;) having a string attached to it; (A;)<br>\
which, when extended in one direction, turns out<br>\
to be of one colour; and when extended in another<br>\
direction, turns out to be of another colour: (A, *<br>\
TA:) it is also called ↓ سَحْرٌ: and whatever. resembles it is called by the former appellation: so<br>\
says Lth. (TA.)<br>\
سَاحِرٌ (tropical:)  [An enchanter;] a man who practices<br>\
سِحْر; as also ↓ سَحَّارٌ [in an intensive sense, or<br>\
denoting habit or frequency]: pl. of the former<br>\
سَحَرَةٌ and سُحَّارٌ; and of ↓ the latter, سَحَّارُونَ<br>\
