سَبَى العَدُوَّ, (S, M, Msb, K,) وَ غَيْرَهُ, (M,) aor.<br>\
يَسْبِى, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. سَبْىٌ (S, M, Msb, K)<br>\

-b2-  [Hence,] تَسْبِى قَلْبَ<br>\
الرَّجُلِ (assumed tropical:)  [She captivates the heart of the man], said<br>\
of a woman. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And سَبَيْتُ قَلْبَهُ and ↓ اِسْتَبَيْتُهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I captivated his heart. (M.) And قَلْبَ ↓ اِسْتَبَتْ<br>\
الفَتَى, said of a girl, or young woman, i. q. سَبَتْهُ<br>\
[i. e. (assumed tropical:)  She captivated the heart of the youth, or<br>\
young man.] (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  One says also, إِنَّ اللَّيْلَ<br>\
طَوِيلٌ وَ لَا أُسْبَ لَهُ and لا أُسْبَى له, the latter on the<br>\
authority of Lh, who says that it means a prayer,<br>\
(M, TA,) for which reason the verb [in the<br>\
former instance] is in the mejzoom form, (TA,) i. e.<br>\
[Verily the night is long, and] may I not be made<br>\
as the captive [to it]. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  سَبَى الخَمْرَ,<br>\
(S, M, K,) aor. as above, (M,) inf. n. سَبْىٌ and<br>\
سِبَآءٌ, (T, M, K,) though J says only the latter,<br>\
(K,) He conveyed wine from one town, or country,<br>\
to another; (S, K;) or he brought wine from one<br>\
land to another; as also ↓ اِسْتَبَاهَا: (M:) [and]<br>\
so سَبَأَهَا, with hemz: (Msb:) or سَبَأْتُ, with hemz,<br>\
means “ I bought ” (S, M) wine, to drink it. (S.<br>\
[See art. سبأ.]) ―<br>\
-b6-  سَبَاهُ اللّٰهُ, (ISk, S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
as above, (S,) inf. n. سَبْىٌ, (S, M,) God estranged<br>\
him; (ISk, S, M, K;) removed him far away;<br>\
(S, K;) and cursed him: (M:) or it is like the<br>\
saying لَعَنَهُ اللّٰهُ: (S:) [or may God estrange<br>\
him; &amp;c.:] one says, مَا لَهُ سَبَاهُ اللّٰهُ [What ails<br>\
him? May God estrange him; &amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\

8<br>\
إِسْتَبَىَ see 1, in four places.<br>\
سَبْىٌ i. q. ↓ مَسْبِىٌّ [i. e. Made captive]; (M;)<br>\
or السَّبْىُ signifies مَا يُسْبَى [i.e. what is made<br>\
captive; but I rather think that the right explanation is مَنْ يُسْبَى i. e the person who is made<br>\
captive; agreeably with what follows]: pl. سُبِىٌّ:<br>\
(M, K:) one says قَوْمٌ سَبْىٌ [a company, or party,<br>\
of men made captive]; the latter word in this<br>\
case being an inf. n. used as an epithet; [therefore, as such, it is applicable to a single person,<br>\
male or female, as well as to a pl. number;] and<br>\
accord. to As, one says not otherwise than thus<br>\
in speaking of a company, or party, of men:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) [but] ↓ سَبِىٌّ is [also] applied to a<br>\
single person, to the male and the female, (M, K,)<br>\
i. e. to the latter, as to the former, without ة, (M,)<br>\
as meaning made captive: (K:) or سَبِىٌّ is applied to a boy, or young man, or male slave, as<br>\
also ↓ مَسْبِىٌّ; and سَبِيَّةٌ to a girl, or young woman,<br>\
or female slave, as also ↓ مَسْبِيَّةٌ; (Msb;) or to a<br>\
woman, in this sense: (S:) and the pl. of ↓ سَبِىٌّ,<br>\
(M, K,) or of سَبِيَّةٌ, (Msb,) is سَبَايَا, (M, Msb, K,)<br>\
applied to women. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Women, (IAar,<br>\
M, K,) universally; (IAar, M;) because they<br>\
captivate the hearts; or because they are made<br>\
captive, and possessed as property. (M, K.)<br>\
سَبًا: see سَبِىٌّ.<br>\
-A2-  Also A tribe of El-Yemen; regarded as a حَىّ, perfectly decl.; and regarded as a<br>\
قَبِيلَة, [and therefore a fem. proper name,] imperfectly decl. [and written سَبَا]: (M, TA:) or, as is<br>\
said in the Msb, it is the name of a town, or province,<br>\
in El-Yemen; masc., and therefore perfectly decl.;<br>\
and fem., and therefore imperfectly decl.; called<br>\
by the name of its builder: (TA:) [hence,] one<br>\
says, ذَهَبُوا أَيْدِى سَبَا and أَيَادِى سَبَا, [making the<br>\
last word to be without tenween either as a fem.<br>\
proper name or because of pausing after it,] i. e.<br>\
They went away scattered, or dispersed: (S, M,<br>\
K:) J says, (TA,) they are two nouns made one,<br>\
like مَعْدِى كَرِبَ, perfectly decl. because not occurring otherwise than as a denotative of state,<br>\
[and therefore indeterminate,] whether you make<br>\
the former to be a prefixed noun governing the<br>\
latter in the gen. case, or do not so. (S, TA.<br>\
[See also art. سبأ.])<br>\
-A3-  In a verse of &#39;Alkameh<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Abadeh, the phrase بِسَبَا الكَتَّانِ is used for<br>\
بِسَبَائِبِ الكَتَّانِ. (M in art. سب: see سِبٌّ.)<br>\
سِبًا or سِبًى: see 1, first sentence.<br>\
سَبَآءٌ: see سَبِىٌّ.<br>\
سِبَآءٌ: see 1, first sentence.<br>\

-b2-  Also, (K,) or<br>\
عُودٌ سَبِىٌّ, (M,) A branch, or piece of stick or<br>\
wood, brought by a torrent from one tract, or<br>\
region, to another, (M, K,) or from a distant<br>\
place; (M;) and ↓ سَبَآءٌ and ↓ سَبًا signify the<br>\
same. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  سَبِىُّ الحَيَّةِ The slough of the serpent; (M, * K;) as also سَبِيؤُهَا. (K in art. سبأ.<br>\
[Accord. to different copies of the K in the present<br>\
art., سَبْءٌ or سِبْءٌ or سَبْىٌ, all of which are<br>\
wrong.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  سَبِيَّةٌ [or دُرَّةٌ سَبِيَّةٌ] A pearl, or large<br>\
pearl, brought out by the diver (K, TA,) from the<br>\
sea. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also, [or خَمْرٌ سَبِيَّةٌ,] Wine brought<br>\
from one town, or country, to another: (S, M, K:)<br>\
if bought to be drunk, it is termed سَبِيْئَةٌ, with ء:<br>\
(S, M:) or, perhaps, the former may be an instance of the alleviation of ء. (M. [See also<br>\
سَبِيْئَةٌ in art. سبأ.])<br>\
سَابِيَآءُ The مَشِيمَة [or membrane enclosing the<br>\
fœtus in the womb], which come forth with the<br>\
young: (S, K:) or a thin pellicle over the nose<br>\
of the fœtus, which dies if it be not removed from<br>\
it at the birth: (K:) or the water that comes<br>\
forth upon the head of the fœtus, (T, M,) [i. e.]<br>\
at the birth: (T:) pl. سَوَابِى [or سَوَابٍ]. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, as being likened thereto, because of<br>\
its fineness, (M,) (assumed tropical:)  The dust of the burrows, or<br>\
holes, of the jerboa; (K;) or fine dust which the<br>\
jerboa extracts from its burrow, or hole: said by<br>\
Abu-l-&#39;Abbás to be [one] of the burrows, or<br>\
holes, of the jerboa; but this saying of his has<br>\
been rebutted. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence also, (M,) (tropical:)  Increase or offspring [of camels or the like]; (S,<br>\
M, K, TA;) called by the name of that from<br>\
which they come: (M, TA:) or (so accord. to<br>\
the M, but accord. to the K “ and ”) camels for<br>\
breeding: and numerous cattle: (M, K:) or also<br>\
sheep, or goats, having numerous offspring: (T,<br>\
S, K:) and it is also applied to denote a large<br>\
number [app. of animals &amp;c.]. (TA.) One says,<br>\
لِآلِ فُلَانٍ سَابِيَآءُ, meaning (tropical:)  [To such a one belong]<br>\
numerous cattle. (TA.)<br>\
إِسْبَآءَةٌ A streak of blood; (AO, S, M, K;) as<br>\
also ↓أُسْبِيَّةٌ: (M, TA:) pl. أَسَابِىُّ. (AO, S, M,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And An extended thread or string of<br>\
[goats&#39;] hair. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [the pl.] أَسَابِىُّ<br>\
signifies The conspicuous tracks of a road. (TA.)<br>\
أُسْبِيَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مَسْبِىٌّ; and its fem., with ة: see سَبْىٌ, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
