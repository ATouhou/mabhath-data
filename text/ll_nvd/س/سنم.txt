Also A tall plant, of which the سَنَمَة, (S, K,) i. e.<br>\
the head, resembling the ear of corn, (S,) or the<br>\
blossom, (K,) has come forth. (S, K.) [And]<br>\
سَنِمَةٌ signifies Any tree (شَجَرَة) that does not<br>\
bear; its extremities having dried up, and become altered. (M. [In the TA, the word in this<br>\
sense is said to be سَنَمَةٌ: but the former is app.<br>\
the right reading.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (TA,) or سَنِمٌ عَلَى<br>\

kind termed دِقّ [q. v.], in form like what is upon<br>\
the head of the reed, or cane, except that it is<br>\
soft, and the camels eat it in the manner termed<br>\
خَضْمٌ [inf. n. of خَضَمَ, q. v.]: (TA:) [it is the<br>\
n. un. of ↓ سَنَمٌ, the latter being a coll. gen. n., as<br>\
is shown by what follows:] AHn says, some<br>\
assert that the سَنَمَة is such of the produce of<br>\
herbs as resembles the produce of the إِذْخِر [q. v.]<br>\
and the like; and such as the produce of the reed,<br>\
or cane; and that the most excellent of the سَنَم<br>\
are the سَنَم of a herb called the ↓ إِسْنَامَة [n. un. of<br>\
إِسْنَامٌ]; and the camels eat it in the manner<br>\
termed خَضْمٌ, because of its softness; or, as in<br>\
some of the copies [of his work], the camels do<br>\
not eat it. (M.)<br>\
سَنَامٌ of the camel, (S,) of the he-camel and of<br>\
the she-camel, [The hump; i. e.] the highest part<br>\
of the back: (M, TA:) [in substance,] it is to<br>\
the camel like the أَلْيَة [here meaning the fat of<br>\
the tail] to the sheep: (Msb:) pl. أَسْنِمَةٌ (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K) [and app. أَسْنَامٌ also, as seems to be<br>\
indicated by an explanation of this latter pl. in<br>\
what follows]. Hence, in a trad., نِسَآءٌ عَلَى رُؤُوسِهِنَّ<br>\
كَأَسْنِمَةِ البُخْتِ [Women upon whose heads are<br>\
the like of the humps of the Bactrian camels];<br>\
meaning such as wind the head-coverings as turbans upon their heads so as to enlarge them [in<br>\
appearance] thereby. (TA.) [Hence, also, سَنَامُ<br>\
النَّاقَةِ (assumed tropical:)  The name of a star in the constellation of<br>\
Cassiopea: mentioned by Freytag, with a reference to Ideler Untersuch. p. 84.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The<br>\
highest, or highest part, of anything: (TA:) and<br>\
the best, or choice part, (M, TA,) of anything;<br>\
(TA;) because the سَنَام is the best, or the choice<br>\
part, of what is in the camel. (M.) [Hence,]<br>\
أَسْنِمَةُ الرِّمَالِ The protuberant, or elevated, parts<br>\
of the sands; as being likened to the hump of<br>\
the she-camel: (M, TA:) and أَسْنِمَةُ الرَّمْلِ the<br>\
backs of the sands, that rise from the main portions thereof. (TA.) And سَنَامُ الأَرْضِ The بَحْر<br>\
[q. v.] (S, TA [in some copies of the S نَحْر, perhaps correctly نَجْد, i. e. high, or elevated, part])<br>\
of the land: (S, TA:) and the middle of the<br>\
land. (S, K.) And سَنَامُ النَّعْلِ The rising part<br>\
of the middle of the upper side of the sandal,<br>\
which is in the place of the hollow of the foot.<br>\
(Har p. 559.) And أَسْنَامُ نَارٍ The highest parts of<br>\
a fire: (EM p. 156, and TA:) أَسْنَام being pl. of<br>\
سَنَامٌ, which signifies the highest part of a thing.<br>\
(EM ubi suprà.) And سَنَامُ المَجْدِ (assumed tropical:)  The highest<br>\
[of a people] in respect of glory. (TA.)<br>\

(M, K, TA; [in the CK, of the حُلَيّا;]) mentioned by Seer on the authority of Aboo-Málik:<br>\
(M:) n. un. with ة. (K.) And the latter signifies A certain herb: (see سَنَمَةٌ:) or a species of<br>\
tree: pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] إِسْنَامٌ. (M.)<br>\
تَسْنِيمٌ [originally inf. n. of 2, q. v.,] A certain<br>\
water in Paradise; so called because running<br>\
above the elevated chambers (S, K *) and the<br>\
pavilions: mentioned in the Kur lxxxiii. 27: (S:)<br>\
or a certain fountain, or source, (عَيْنٌ,) in Paradise: so they assert; and this requires its being<br>\
determinate, imperfectly decl.: or, accord. to Zj,<br>\
a water coming upon them from above, from the<br>\
elevated chambers: (M:) or a certain fountain,<br>\
or source, coming upon them from above. (K<br>\
[and in like manner Az explains it].)<br>\
أَرْضٌ مُسْنِمَةٌ A land that gives growth to the<br>\
إِسْنَامَة, n. un. of إِسْنَامٌ. (K, TA.)<br>\
مُسَنَّمٌ A camel left unridden [so that he is made<br>\
to have a large hump]. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And قَبْرٌ<br>\
