سَآهُ, (S, M, K,) like رَمَاهُ, [or rather like<br>\

copies of the K, (TA,) i. q. سَآءَهُ, (S, M, K, TA,)<br>\

(M:) and سَأَوْتُهُ, meaning سُؤْتُهْ [I displeased,<br>\
grieved, or vexed, him]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\

or excited, disorder, or discord, between them, or<br>\

the pl. is transformed, so that it is as though it<br>\
were pl. of مَسْآةٌ, like مَسْعَاةٌ. (M.)<br>\
