(Mgh, Msb,) said to be an ancient Greek word,<br>\
[*skammwhi/a] or, as some say, (Msb,) Syriac,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) [Seammony;] a certain plant,<br>\
from the hollows of which is extracted a mucilage,<br>\
which is dried, and is called by the name of its<br>\
plant: it is more repugnant to the stomach and<br>\
the bowels than all the laxatives; but it is rendered good by aromatic substances, such as pepper<br>\
and ginger and aniseed: the weight of six barleycorns thereof to twenty eases the yellow bile, and<br>\
noxious viscosities, from the most remote parts of<br>\
the body; and a portion thereof with a portion<br>\
of تُرْبُد, or تِربَد, [so in different copies of the K,<br>\
or تُرْبَذ, or تِرْبَذ, i. e. turpeth,] in fresh milk,<br>\
taken fasting, will not leave a single worm in the<br>\
belly: it is wonderful in that effect, and proved<br>\
by experiment. (K.)<br>\
