سَبَحَ, aor.<br>\
سَبَحَ, inf. n. سَبْحٌ (Msb, K) and<br>\
سِبَاحَةٌ, (S, * K,) or the latter is a simple subst.,<br>\
(Msb,) He swam, syn. عَامَ, (S, * K,) بِالنَّهْرِ and<br>\
فِيهِ [in the river], (K,) or rather بِالمَآءِ (MF, TA)<br>\
or فى المَآءِ (Msb) [i. e. in the water], for it is likewise in the sea, and in a pool, and also in any<br>\
expanse: (MF, TA:) [or he swam upon the surface, without immersing himself; for,] accord. to<br>\
Z, there is a difference between عَوْمٌ and سِبَاحَةٌ;<br>\
the former signifying the “ coursing along in<br>\
water with immersion of oneself; ” and the latter,<br>\
the coursing along upon water without immersion<br>\
of oneself. (MF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] النُّجُومُ تَسْبَحُ<br>\
فِى الفَلَكِ (A, TA) (tropical:)  The stars [swim, or glide<br>\
along, or] pass along, in the firmament, with a<br>\
spreading forth. (TA.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
xxi. 34 and xxxvi. 40, with reference to the sun and<br>\
the moon, (Bd and Jel in xxi. 34,) with which<br>\
the stars are meant to be included, (Jel ibid.,)<br>\
كُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  All [glide or] travel<br>\
along swiftly, [in a firmament,] like the swimmer<br>\
(Bd and Jel ibid.) upon the surface of the water,<br>\
(Bd ibid.,) or in the water; (Jel ibid.;) wherefore the form of the verb used is that which is<br>\
appropriate to rational beings, (Bd and Jel ibid.,)<br>\
swimming being the act of such beings. (Bd<br>\
ibid.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence] one says, سَبَحَ ذِكْرُكَ مَسَابِحَ<br>\
الشَّمْسِ وَ القَمَرِ ↓  (tropical:)  [Thy fame has travelled<br>\
as far as the sun and the moon; lit., swum along<br>\
the tracts along which swim the sun and the<br>\
moon]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence, likewise, as inf. n.<br>\
of سَبَحَ, aor. as above,] سَبْحٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The<br>\
running of a horse (S, L, K, * TA) in which the<br>\
fore legs are stretched forth well [like as are<br>\
the arms of a man in swimming]. (L, K, * TA.)<br>\

-b6-<br>\
And (assumed tropical:)  The being, or becoming, remote. (MF.) ―<br>\

And (assumed tropical:)  The travelling far. (K.) You say, سَبَحَ<br>\
فِى الأَرْضِ (assumed tropical:)  He went, or travelled, far, in, or<br>\
into, the land, or country: (O, TA:) and سَبَخَ:<br>\
both thus expl. by Abu-l-Jahm El-Jaafaree.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And (assumed tropical:)  The journeying for the purpose<br>\
of traffic (تَقَلُّب [q. v.]); and [a people&#39;s] becoming scattered, or dispersed, in the land, or<br>\
earth. (K.) And (assumed tropical:)  The busying oneself in going<br>\
to and fro, or seeking gain, (IAar, TA,) and occupying oneself according to his own judgment or<br>\
discretion, in the disposal or management of<br>\
affairs, in respect of the means of subsistence.<br>\
(IAar, S, K, TA.) You say, فُلَانٌ يَسْبَحُ النَّهَارَ<br>\
كُلَّهُ فِى طَلَبِ المَعَاشِ (tropical:)  [Such a one busies himself in going to and fro, or occupies himself<br>\
according to his own judgment or discretion, in<br>\
seeking the means of subsistence]. (A, TA.) And<br>\
سَبَحَ فِى حَوَائِجِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He occupied himself according to his own judgment or discretion in the<br>\
accomplishment of his needful affairs. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b9-  As used in the Kur [lxxiii. 7], where it is<br>\
said, إِنَّ لَكَ فِى النَّهَارِ سَبْحًا طَوِيلًا, it is variously<br>\
explained: (S, TA:) accord. to Katádeh (S) and<br>\
El-Muärrij, (S, TA,) the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  [Verily<br>\
thou hast in the day-time] long freedom from<br>\
occupation; (S, K, * TA;) and in this sense, also,<br>\
its verb is سَبَحَ, aor.<br>\
سَبَحَ: (JM:) [thus it has two<br>\
contr. significations:] or, accord. to Lth, (assumed tropical:)  leisure<br>\
for sleep: (TA:) accord. to AO, the meaning<br>\
is, (assumed tropical:)  long-continued scope, or room, for free<br>\
action; syn. مُتَقَلَّبًا طَوِيلًا: and accord. to ElMuärrij, it means also (assumed tropical:)  coming and going: (S,<br>\
TA:) accord. to Fr, the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  thou hast<br>\
in the day-time the accomplishment of thy needful<br>\
affairs: (TA:) or the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  [long] occupation of thyself in thy affairs of business; not<br>\
being free from occupation therein for the reciting<br>\
of the Kur-án. (Jel.) Some read سَبْخًا, which<br>\
has nearly the same meaning as سَبْحًا. (Zj, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b10-  As inf. n. of سَبَحَ, (TK,) it signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
state of sleeping. (K.) And as such also, (TK,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The being still, quiet, or motionless. (K.) ―<br>\
-b11-<br>\
[Also (assumed tropical:)  The glistening of the mirage.] You say,<br>\
سَبَحَ السَّرَابُ, or الآلُ, meaning لَمَعَ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
mirage glistened]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b12-  And (assumed tropical:)  The digging,<br>\
or burrowing, in the earth, or ground. (K, * TA.)<br>\
You say of the jerboa, سَبَحَ فِى الأَرْضِ (assumed tropical:)  He dug,<br>\
or burrowed, in the earth, or ground. (O, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b13-  And (assumed tropical:)  The being profuse in speech. (K.)<br>\
You say, سَبَحَ فِى الكَلَامِ (assumed tropical:)  He was profuse in<br>\
speech. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b14-  See also the next paragraph.<br>\
in two places.<br>\

تَسْبِيحٌ signifies The declaring [God] to be<br>\
far removed, or free, from every imperfection or<br>\
impurity, or from everything derogatory from<br>\
[his] glory; syn. تَنْزِيهٌ, (S, O, Msb, TA,) and<br>\
تَقْدِيسٌ: (Msb:) the magnifying, celebrating,<br>\
lauding, or praising, and glorifying, God; and<br>\
declaring Him to be far removed, or free, from<br>\
everything evil. (TA.) You say, سَبَّحَ اللّٰهَ, (T,<br>\
A, Mgh, Msb, TA,) and سبّح لِلّٰهِ, (Kur lvii. 1 &amp;c.,<br>\
and A,) in which the ل is redundant, (Jel in<br>\
lvii. 1 &amp;c.,) inf. n. تَسْبِيحٌ, and سُبْحَانٌ is a subst.<br>\
that [sometimes] stands in the place of the inf. n.,<br>\
(T, TA,) or it is an inf. n. of which the verb is<br>\
سَبَحَ, (K, TA,) He declared God to be far removed, or free, from every imperfection or impurity &amp;c., (A, Mgh, TA,) or from what they<br>\
say [of Him] who disacknowledge [his attributes];<br>\
(Msb;) [i. e. he declared, or celebrated, or extolled, the perfection or purity, or absolute glory,<br>\
of God;] and he magnified, celebrated, lauded, or<br>\
praised, God, by the mention of his names, saying<br>\
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ and the like: (Msb:) and سبّح [alone],<br>\
(Mgh, K,) inf. n. تَسْبِيحٌ, (K,) he said سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ;<br>\
(Mgh, K;) as also ↓ سَبَحَ, inf. n. سُبْحَانٌ; (K,<br>\
TA;) the latter, which is like شَكَرَ, inf. n. شُكْرَانٌ,<br>\
a dial. var. mentioned by ISd; and no regard<br>\
should be paid to the saying of Ibn-Ya&#39;eesh and<br>\
others, that سبحان is an inf. n. of which the verb<br>\
is obsolete: accord to El-Mufaddal, سُبْحَانٌ is the<br>\
inf. n. of ↓ سَبَحَ signifying he raised his voice<br>\
with supplication, or prayer, and magnification<br>\
or celebration or praise [of God, as when one<br>\
says سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ or the like]; and he cites as<br>\
an ex.,<br>\
قَبَحَ الْإِلٰهُ وَجُوهَ تَغْلِبَ كُلَّمَا<br>\
سَبَحَ الحَجِيجُ وَ كَبَّرُوا إِهْلَالَا<br>\
[May God remove far from good, or prosperity,<br>\
or success, the persons (وُجُوهَ here meaning نُفُوسَ)<br>\
of the tribe of Teghlib, whenever the pilgrims<br>\
raise their voices with supplication, &amp;c., and say<br>\
اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرْ, ejaculating لَبَّيْكَ]. (MF, TA.) وَنَحْنُ<br>\
نُسَبِّحُ بِحَمْدِكَ, in the Kur ii. 28, is a phrase<br>\
denotative of state, (Ksh, Bd, Jel,) meaning<br>\
While we declare thy remoteness from evil [of<br>\
every kind], (Ksh, Bd,) or while we say سُبْحَانَ<br>\
اللّٰهِ, (Jel,) praising Thee, (Ksh,) [or with the<br>\
praising of Thee, i. e.] making the praising of<br>\
Thee to be an accompaniment, or adjunct, to our<br>\
doing that: (Ksh, Bd, Jel:) so that we are the<br>\
more worthy to be appointed thy vice-agents.<br>\
(Ksh, * Bd, * Jel.) فَسَبِّحْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ العَظِيمِ, in the<br>\
Kur lvi. 73 and last verse, means Therefore<br>\
declare thou the remoteness from what is unsuitable to his majesty by mentioning the name of<br>\
thy Lord, or by mentioning the Lord, for the<br>\
pronouncing of the name of a thing is the mentioning of it, [i. e., of the thing itself,] the great<br>\
name, or the great Lord: (Bd:) or it means<br>\
therefore pray thou commencing with, or uttering,<br>\
the name of thy Lord [the great name or Lord]:<br>\
(Kull p. 211:) [for] ―<br>\
-b2-  تَسْبِيحٌ also signfies The<br>\
act of praying. (K, Msb.) You say, سَبَّحَ meaning He prayed. (A, Mgh.) And [particularly]<br>\
He performed the [supererogatory] prayer of<br>\
[the period termed] الضُّحَى. (TA.) And فُلَانٌ<br>\
يُسَبِّحُ اللّٰهَ, i. e. ↓ يُصَلِّى السَّبْحَةَ, meaning Such a<br>\
one performs prayer to God, either obligatory or<br>\
supererogatory: [but generally the latter: (see<br>\
سُبْحَةٌ:)] and يُسَبِّحُ عَلَى رَاحِلَتِهِ performs supererogatory prayer [upon his camel that he is<br>\
riding]. (Msb.) It is said in the Kur [iii. 36],<br>\
وَسَبِّحْ بِالْعَشِىِّ وَالْإِبْكَارَ, i. e. And pray thou [in the<br>\
evening, or the afternoon, and the early morning].<br>\
(TA.) And it is related of &#39;Omar, أَنَّهُ جَلَدَ رَجُلَيْنِ<br>\
سَبَّحَا بَعْدَ العَصْرِ, meaning [That he flogged two<br>\
men] who prayed [after the prescribed time of the<br>\
afternoon-prayer]. (S, TA.) You say also, بِيَدِهِ<br>\
يُسَبِّحُ بِهَا ↓ سُبْحَةٌ [i. e. In his hand is a string of<br>\
beads by the help of which he repeats the praises<br>\
of God: see سُبْحَةٌ, below]. (A, Msb. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
The making an exception, by saying إِنْ شَآءَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
[If God will]: because, by so saying, one magnifies God, and acknowledges that one should<br>\
not will unless God will: and thus is expl. the<br>\
saying in the Kur [lxviii. 28], أَلَمْ أَقُلْ لَكُمْ لَوْ لَا<br>\
تُسَبِّحُونَ [Did I not say to you, Wherefore will<br>\
ye not make an exception? addressed to the<br>\
owners of a garden, who “ swore that they would<br>\
certainly cut its fruit when they should be entering upon the time of morning, they not making<br>\
an exception ”]. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
سابحهُ, [inf. n. مُسَابَحَةٌ,] i. q. رَاسَاهُ, (T and<br>\
K in art. رسو,) i. e. He swam with him. (TK in<br>\
that art.) [And app. also He vied, or contended,<br>\
with him in swimming.]<br>\
4<br>\
اسبحهُ He made him to swim (K, TA) فِى<br>\
المَآءِ [in the water] or فَوْقَ المَآءِ [upon the water].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
سَبْحَةٌ Garments of skins: (K:) or, accord. to<br>\
Sh, سِبَاحٌ, which is the pl., signifies shirts of<br>\
skins, for boys: AO corrupted the word, relating<br>\
it as written سُبْجَةٌ, with ج, and with damm<br>\
to the س; whereas this signifies “ a black [garment of the kind called] كِسَآء: ” and a verse<br>\
cited by him as presenting an ex. of its pl., in its<br>\
last word, is from a poem of which each verse has<br>\
for its fundamental rhyme-letter the unpointed ح:<br>\
ISd, in art. سبج, mentions سِبَاجٌ as signifying<br>\
“ garments of skin,” and having سبجة for its<br>\
sing.; but says that the word with the unpointed<br>\
ح is of higher authority; though he also states<br>\
it, in the same art., to have been corrupted by<br>\
AO. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [A meaning belonging to سُبْحَةٌ<br>\
(q. v.) is assigned in some copies of the K to<br>\
سَبْحَةٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  السَّبْحَةُ, (K,) or سَبْحَةُ, from سَابِحٌ as<br>\
an epithet applied to a horse, or mare, (IAth,<br>\
TA,) is a proper name of A horse, or mare,<br>\
belonging to the Prophet: (IAth, K, TA:) and<br>\
of another belonging to Jaafar the son of Aboo-<br>\
Tálib; (K;) or this was a mare named سَمْحَةُ:<br>\
(O:) and of another belonging to another. (K.)<br>\
سُبْحَةٌ Beads (S, Msb, K, TA) strung (Msb,<br>\
TA) upon a string or thread, (TA,) [ninety-nine<br>\
in number, and having a mark after each thirtythree,] with which (by counting them, K) one<br>\
performs the act termed التَّسْبِيح [meaning the<br>\
repetition of the praises of God, generally consisting in repeating the words سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهْ thirtythree times, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهْ thirty-three times, and<br>\
اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرْ thirty-three times, which is done by<br>\
many persons after the ordinary prayers, as a<br>\
supererogatory act]: (S, A, Msb, K:) its appellation implies that it is an Arabic word; but Az<br>\
says that it is post-classical: its pl. is سُبَحٌ (Msb)<br>\
and سُبُحَاتٌ also. (Har p. 133.) See 2, last<br>\
sentence but one. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Invocation of God;<br>\
or supplication: (K:) and prayer, (A, Msb,)<br>\
whether obligatory or supererogatory: (Msb:)<br>\
or supererogatory praise; (S;) and supererogatory<br>\
prayer; (S, A, Mgh, K;) because of the تَسْبِيحٌ<br>\
therein. (Mgh.) You say, فُلَانٌ يُصَلِّى السُّبْحَةَ,<br>\
expl. above; see 2, in the latter part of the paragraph. (Msb.) And قَضَىسُبْحَتَهُ He performed,<br>\
or finished, his prayer: (A:) or قَضَيْتُ سُبْحَتِى<br>\
means I performed, or finished, my supererogatory praise and such prayer. (S.) And صَلَّى<br>\
السُّبْحَةَ He performed the supererogatory prayer:<br>\
(A:) and سُبْحَةَ الضُّحَى [the supererogatory<br>\
prayer of the period termed الضُّحَى]. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  سُبْحَةُ اللّٰهِ, (IAth, K, TA,) with damm, (TA,<br>\
[but in my MS. copy of the K written سَبْحَة,<br>\
and so in the CK,]) means (assumed tropical:)  The greatness, or<br>\
majesty, of God: (IAth, K, TA:) or [the pl.]<br>\
السُّبُحَاتُ, occurring in a trad., means (assumed tropical:)  the<br>\
greatness, or majesty, and the light [or splendour],<br>\
of God: (Msb:) or by the saying سُبُحَاتُ وَجْهِ<br>\
رَبِّنَا, with damm to the س and ب, is meant (assumed tropical:)  the<br>\
greatness, or majesty, of the face of our Lord:<br>\
(S:) or سُبُحَاتُ وَجْهِ اللّٰهِ means (assumed tropical:)  the lights [or<br>\
splendours], (K,) or, accord. to ISh, the light [or<br>\
splendour], (TA,) of the face of God: (ISh, K,<br>\
TA:) some say that سُبُحَاتُ الوَجْهِ means (assumed tropical:)  the<br>\
beauties of the face; because, when you see a<br>\
person of beautiful face, you say, سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ [to<br>\
express your admiration]: and some, that [when<br>\
it relates to God] it denotes a declaration of his<br>\
being far removed from every imperfection;<br>\
meaning سُبْحَانَ وَجْهِهِ. (TA. [See سُبْحَان.])<br>\
One says, [addressing God,] أَسْأَلُكَ بِسُبُحَاتِ وَجْهِكَ<br>\
الكَرِيمِ, with two dammehs, meaning (tropical:)  [I ask<br>\
Thee] by the evidences of thy greatness, or majesty,<br>\
[or of the greatness, or majesty, of thy glorious<br>\
face,] by the acknowledgement whereof thy praise<br>\
is celebrated. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  السُّبُحَاتُ also signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The places of prostration [probably meaning<br>\
in the reciting of the Kur-án]. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also,<br>\
i. e. [the sing.,] سُبْحَةٌ, A piece of cotton. (TA.)<br>\
سُبْحَانٌ is the inf. n. of سَبَحَ as syn. with سَبَّحَ<br>\
[q. v.]; (K, TA;) and is a subst. that [sometimes] stands in the place of the inf. n. of the<br>\
latter of these verbs, i. e. in the sense of تَسْبِيحٌ.<br>\
(T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سُبْحَانَ is a proper name in the<br>\
sense of التَّسْبِيح, and [for this reason, and also<br>\
because it ends with ا and ن,] it is imperfectly<br>\
decl., and is also invariable; being put in the<br>\
accus. case in the manner of an inf. n. (Mgh.)<br>\
You say سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ, meaning I declare [or<br>\
celebrate or extol] the remoteness, or freedom, of<br>\
God [from every imperfection or impurity, or<br>\
from everything derogatory from his glory,<br>\
i. e.] from the imputation of there being any<br>\
equal to Him, or any companion, or anything<br>\
like unto Him, or anything contrary to Him;<br>\
or from everything that should not be imputed to<br>\
Him: (L:) [I declare, or celebrate, or extol, his<br>\
absolute perfection or glory or purity: or extolled be his absolute perfection &amp;c.:] or I declare<br>\
the remoteness of God, or his freedom (بَرَآءَة),<br>\
from evil, (Zj, * S, K, TA,) or from every evil;<br>\
(TA;) and [especially] from the imputation of<br>\
his having a female companion, and offspring:<br>\
(K:) or I declare God&#39;s being very far removed<br>\
from all the foul imputations of those who assert<br>\
a plurality of gods: (MF:) [it sometimes implies wonder, and may well be rendered how far<br>\
is God from every imperfection! &amp;c.:] in this<br>\
case, سبحان is a determinate noun; (K;) i. e.,<br>\
a generic proper name, for التَّسْبِيح, like as بَرَّةُ is<br>\
for البِرُّ. (MF:) Zj says, (TA,) it is put in the<br>\
accus. case in the manner of an inf. n.; (S, K;)<br>\
i. e., as the absolute complement of a verb<br>\
understood; the phrase with the verb supplied<br>\
being أُسَبِّحُ اللّٰهَ سُبْحَانَهُ; (MF;) meaning أُبَرِّئُ<br>\
اللّٰهَ مِنَ السُّوْءِ بَرَآءَةً; (S, K, MF;) سبحان thus<br>\
supplying the place of the verb: accord. to Ibn-El-Hájib and others, when it is prefixed to another<br>\
noun or pronoun, governing it in the gen. case,<br>\
it is a quasi-inf. n.; and when not so prefixed, it<br>\
is a proper name, imperfectly decl.: but to this it<br>\
is objected that a proper name may be thus<br>\
prefixed for the purpose of distinction, as in the<br>\
instances of حَاتِمُ طَيِّئٍ and زَيْدُ الفَوَارِسِ: some<br>\
say that it is an inf. n. of an obsolete verb; but<br>\
this assertion is not to be regarded; for, as an<br>\
inf. n., its verb is سَبَحَ, like شَكَرَ of which the<br>\
inf. n. is شُكْرَانٌ: others say that it may be an<br>\
inf. n. of سَبَّحَ, though far from being agreeable<br>\
with analogy: and some derive it from السَّبْحُ as<br>\
signifying “ the act of swimming,” or “ the being<br>\
quick, or swift,” or “ the being, or becoming,<br>\
remote,” &amp;c.: (MF:) [hence F adds,] or the<br>\
phrase above-mentioned denotes quickness in<br>\
betaking oneself to God, and agility in serving,<br>\
or obeying, Him; [and therefore may be rendered<br>\
I betake myself quickly to the service of God,<br>\
and am prompt in obeying Him;] (K;) so<br>\
accord. to ISh, to whom a man presented himself in a dream, and indicated this explanation of<br>\
the phrase, deriving it from سَبَحَ الفَرَسُ [“ the<br>\
horse ran stretching forth his fore legs, as one<br>\
does with his arms in swimming ”]. (L.)<br>\
فَسُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ حِينَ تُمْسُونَ وَحِينَ تُصْبِحُونُ, [in<br>\
which سبحان is used in the place of the inf. n. of<br>\
سَبَّحَ, and سَبِّحُوا is understood before it,] in the<br>\
Kur [xxx. 16], means Therefore perform ye<br>\
prayer to God [or declare ye the remoteness of<br>\
God from every imperfection &amp;c.] when ye enter<br>\
upon the time of evening and when ye enter<br>\
upon the time of daybreak. (Fr, TA.) And<br>\
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ عَمَّا يَصِفْونَ, in the Kur xxiii. 93,<br>\
means Far [or how far] is God from that by<br>\
which they describe Him! (Jel.) One says also,<br>\
سُبْحَانَكَ اللّٰهُمَّ وَبِحَمْدِكَ, meaning سَبَّحْتُكَ بِجَمِيعِ<br>\
آلَائِكَ وَبِحَمْدِكَ سَبَّحْتُكَ [i. e. I glorify Thee by<br>\
enumerating all thy benefits, and by the praising<br>\
of Thee I glorify Thee]. (Mgh. [See also the<br>\
prep. بِ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  سُبْحَانَ مِنْ كَذَا, (Msb, K,) or<br>\
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ مِنْ كَذَا, (S,) and سُبْحَانَ مِنْ فُلَانٍ,<br>\
(A,) are (tropical:)  phrases expressive of wonder (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K) at a thing (S, Msb, K) and a person;<br>\
(A;) originating from God&#39;s being glorified<br>\
(أَنْ يُسَبَّحَ اللّٰهُ) at the sight of what is wonderful<br>\
of his works, and afterwards, by reason of its<br>\
being frequently said, employed in relation to<br>\
anything at which one wonders; (Er-Radee,<br>\
TA;) meaning (assumed tropical:)  [I wonder greatly (lit., with<br>\
wondering) at such a thing and such a person;<br>\
as is shown by what follows; or] how extraordinary, or strange, is such a thing [and such a<br>\
person!]. (Msb.) El-Aashà says,<br>\
أَقُولُ لَمَّا جَآءَنِى فَخْرُهُ<br>\
سُبْحَانَ مِنْ عَلْقَمَةَ الفَاخِر<br>\
(S, Msb *) (assumed tropical:)  [I saying, when his boasting reached<br>\
me, I wonder greatly at&#39; Alkameh the boasting];<br>\
i. e. العَجَبُ مِنْهُ, (S,) or [rather] عَجَبًا لَهُ [for<br>\
أَعْجَبُ عَحَبًا لَهُ], lit. I wonder with wondering at<br>\
him; (Msb;) [or how extraordinary a person is<br>\
&#39;Alkameh the boasting !:] سبحان being without<br>\
tenween because it is regarded by them as a<br>\
determinate noun, and having a resemblance to a<br>\
fem. noun: (S:) [though in what quality it<br>\
resembles a fem. noun, except in its being of one<br>\
of the measures of broken pls., I do not know:]<br>\
or it is imperfectly decl. because it is a determinate noun, being a proper name for البَرَآءَة (IJ,<br>\
IB) and التَّنْزِيه, (IJ,) and because of the addition<br>\
of the ا and ن: (IJ, IB:) this is the true reason:<br>\
but some hold that it is rendered determinate by<br>\
its being prefixed to a noun understood, governing<br>\
it in the gen. case; the complete phrase being<br>\
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ مِنْ عَلْقَمَةَ. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b4-  سُبْحَانًا, thus<br>\
with tenween, as an indeterminate noun, occurs<br>\
in the phrase سُبْحَانَهُ ثُمَّ سُبْحَانًا, in a poem of<br>\
Umeiyeh. (IB.)<br>\
-A2-  سُبْحَان is also used in the<br>\
sense of نَفْس, in the saying أَنْتَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَا فِى<br>\
سُبْحَانِكَ [Thou art possessed of more, or most,<br>\
knowledge of that which is in thine own mind]. (K.)<br>\
سَبُوحٌ: see سَابِحٌ, in three places.<br>\
سِبَاحَةٌ an inf. n., (K,) or a simple subst.,<br>\
(Msb,) from سَبَحَ; (Msb, K;) Natation; or the<br>\
act [or art] of swimming: (S, A, Msb, * K:) or<br>\
the coursing along upon water without immersion<br>\
of oneself. (MF, TA. [See 1, first sentence.])<br>\
سَبَّاحٌ: see سَابِحٌ, in two places.<br>\
سُبُّوحٌ, also pronounced سَبُّوحٌ, (T, S, Msb, K,<br>\
&amp;c.,) the latter the more agreeable with analogy,<br>\
but the former the more common, (Th, T, S,<br>\
Msb, *) one of the epithets applied to God, (T,<br>\
S, A, Msb, * K,) because He is an object of<br>\
تَسْبِيح, (K,) and [often] immediately followed by<br>\
قُدُّوسٌ, (A, Msb, K,) which is likewise also pronounced قَدُّوسٌ, though the former pronunciation<br>\
is the more common: (Th, T, S, Msb: *) it signifies [All-perfect, all-pure, or all-glorious; i. e.]<br>\
far removed, or free, from everything evil, (Zj,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, TA,) and from every imperfection<br>\
[and the like]. (Msb. [See 2, and see also<br>\
سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ.]) It is said (S, Msb) by Th (S) that<br>\
there is no word like the two epithets above, of<br>\
the measure فعُّول with damm as well as with<br>\
fet-h to the first letter, except ذرّوح: (S, Msb:)<br>\
but the following similar instances have been<br>\
pointed out: ستّوق among epithets, and ذرّوح and<br>\
شبّوط and فرّوج and سفّود and كلّوب among<br>\
substs. (TA.) Sb says, لَيْسَ فِى الكَلَامِ فُعَّوْلٌ<br>\
بِوَاحِدَةٍ [expl. voce ذُرَّاحٌ]: (S:) [or] accord. to<br>\
AHei, Sb said that there is no epithet of the<br>\
measure فُعُّولٌ except سُبُّوحٌ and قُدُّوسٌ: Lh<br>\
mentions سُتُّوقٌ also, as an epithet applied to a<br>\
دِرْهَم, as well as سَتُّوقٌ. (TA.)<br>\
السَّبَّاحَةُ: see المُسَبِّحَةُ, in two places.<br>\
سَابِحٌ and ↓ سَبَّاحٌ (Msb, K) and ↓ سَبُوحٌ (K)<br>\
are part. ns., or epithets, from سَبَحَ in the first of<br>\
the senses assigned to it above: (Msb, K:) [the<br>\
first signifies Swimming, or a swimmer:] the<br>\
second has an intensive signification [i. e. one<br>\
who swims much, or a great swimmer; as also<br>\
the third]: (Msb:) the pl. of the first, accord. to<br>\
IAar, not of the first and last as it appears to be<br>\
accord. to the K, is سُبَحَآءُ: (MF:) that of the<br>\
second is سَبَّاحُونَ: (K:) and that of the third is<br>\
سُبُحٌ or سِبَاحٌ, the former reg., and the latter<br>\
irreg. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b2-  السَّابِحَات, (K, &amp;c.,) in the Kur<br>\
[lxxix. 3], accord. to Az, (TA,) means The<br>\
ships: (K:) or (assumed tropical:)  the souls of the believers أَرْوَاحُ<br>\
المُؤْمِنِينَ [for which Golius seems to have found<br>\
in a copy of the K أَزْوَاجُ المُؤْمِنِينَ, for he gives<br>\
as an explanation piæ et fidelium uxores,,]) (K,<br>\
TA) which go forth with ease: or (assumed tropical:)  the angels<br>\
that swim, or glide, (تَسْبَحُ,) from (من [app. a<br>\
mistranscription for بَيْنَ between]) the heaven<br>\
and the earth: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  the stars, (K,) which<br>\
swim, or glide along, (تَسْبَحُ,) in the firmament,<br>\
like the سَابِح in water. (TA.) [The meanings<br>\
fœminæ jejunantes and veloces equi and planetæ,<br>\
assigned to this word by Golius as on the authority<br>\
of the KL, are in that work assigned to سَائِحَات;<br>\
the first of them as the meaning of this word in<br>\
the Kur lxvi. 5.] And you say نُجُومٌ سَوَابِحُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Stars gliding along in the firmament: سوابح<br>\
being a pl. of سَابِحٌ applied to an irrational thing,<br>\
and of سَابِحَةٌ]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  سَابِحٌ is also applied as<br>\
an epithet to a horse, (S, IAth, A, L,) meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  That stretches forth his fore legs well in running<br>\
[like as one does the arms in swimming]; (S, *<br>\
IAth, L;) and in like manner ↓ سَبُوحٌ [but in an<br>\
intensive sense]: (A, L:) the pl. [of the former]<br>\
is سَوَابِحُ and سُبَّحٌ. (A.) And سَوَابِحُ also signified (tropical:)  Horses; (K, TA;) as an epithet in which<br>\
the quality of a subst. is predominant; (TA;)<br>\
because they thus stretch forth their fore legs in<br>\
running. (K, * TA.) Hence, (TA,) ↓ السَّبُوحُ is<br>\
the name of A horse of Rabeea Ibn-Jusham.<br>\
(K, TA.) And in like manner, ↓ السَّبَّاحُ is the<br>\
name of A celebrated courser: (TA:) and of A<br>\
certain camel. (K, TA.)<br>\
تَسْبِيحَاتٌ and تَسَابِيحُ [pls. of تَسْبِيحَةٌ A single<br>\
act of تَسْبِيح: see 2]. (A.)<br>\
[<br>\
مَسْبَحٌ A place of swimming, &amp;c.: pl. مَسَابِحُ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See an ex. of the pl. in the first paragraph of<br>\
this art.<br>\
مُسَبَّحٌ, accord. to AA and the K, applied as an<br>\
epithet to a [garment of the kind called] كِسَآء,<br>\
means Strong: and accord. to the former, مُسَبَّجٌ,<br>\
so applied, means “ made wide. ” (TA.)<br>\
مُسَبِّحٌ [act. part. n. of 2]. فَلَوْلَا أَنَّهُ كَانَ مِنَ<br>\
المُسَبِّحِينَ, in the Kur [xxxvii. 143], means And<br>\
had he not been of the performers of prayer,<br>\
(A, * Mgh, Msb, K, *) as some say. (Mgh.)<br>\
المُسَبَّحَةُ (A, Msb, TA) and ↓ السَّبَّاحَةُ (A, TA)<br>\
(tropical:)  [The index, or fore finger;] the finger that is<br>\
next the thumb: (Msb, TA:) so called because<br>\
it is like the glorifier when one makes a sign<br>\
with it [by raising it] when declaring [the unity<br>\
of] the divine essence. (Msb, TA. *) One says,<br>\
أَشَارَ إِلَيْهِ بِالمُسَبِّحَةِ and ↓ بِالسَّبَّاحَةِ (tropical:)  [He pointed<br>\
towards him, or it, with the fore finger]. (A, TA.)<br>\
