سَهَدَ, (S, L, K,) inf. n. سُهَادٌ (S, * A, *<br>\
L) and سُهْدٌ (A, * L, K *) and سَهَدٌ, (S, L,) [all<br>\

تسهّد is said by Freytag, as on the authority of the K, in which I do not find it, to signify<br>\
He was sleepless; like سَهِدَ: if used, it more probably signifies he was rendered sleepless; as<br>\
quasi-pass. of سَهَّدَهُ.]<br>\

سُهُدٌ One who sleeps little; (S, A, L, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ مُسَهَّدٌ: (A:) and some say سُهَدُ, like عُمَرُ;<br>\

sleeps little. (L.) ―<br>\

مِنْهُ سَهْدَةً, meaning (tropical:)  I experienced not, or I have<br>\
not experienced, from him any mindfulness of<br>\
what is good, nor any desire for it: (A, TA:) or<br>\
anything upon which to place reliance, of words<br>\

سُهَادٌ (S, A, L) and ↓ سُهْدٌ (A, L, K) Sleeplessness. (S, A, L, K. [Both mentioned in the L<br>\
