سَافَ الشَّىْءَ, aor. يَسُوفُ (S, M, Msb) and<br>\
يَسَافُ, (M,) inf. n. سَوْفٌ; (S, M, K;) and so<br>\
↓ ساوفهُ; (M, TA;) and ↓ استافهُ, (M, Msb, K, *)<br>\
inf. n. اِسْتِيَافٌ; (S;) [and, accord. to Freytag,<br>\
↓ سوّفهُ; but he has not named his authority; if<br>\
correct, probably having an intensive signification;] He smelled the thing. (S, M, Msb.) A<br>\
poet says, (Msb,) namely, Ru-beh, (S, M,)<br>\
أَخْلَاقَ الطُّرُقْ ↓ إِذَا الدَّلِيلُ اسْتَافَ<br>\
[When the guide smells the natures of the roads<br>\
to know whether he be pursuing the right course<br>\
or deviating therefrom]. (S, M, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And<br>\
hence, He hunted. (Freytag, from the Deewán<br>\
el-Hudhaleeyeen.)]<br>\
-A2-  سَوْفٌ is also Syn. with صَبْرٌ.<br>\
(IAar, K.) You say, of a man, ساف عَلَيْهِ, inf. n.<br>\
سَوْفٌ, He endured it with patience. (TK.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
سَافَ, (S, M, O, K,) aor. يَسُوفُ (S, O, K) and<br>\
يَسَافُ, (O, K,) inf. n. سَوْفٌ, (M,) said of a man,<br>\
(M,) and of cattle, (مَال, M, O, K,) He, or they,<br>\
perished, or died: (S, M, O, K:) or, said of<br>\
cattle, they had a murrain occurring among<br>\
them. (K.)<br>\
-A4-  [سَافَ expl. by Freytag in this art.,<br>\
as though having for its aor. يَسُوفُ, and meaning<br>\
He smote a person with a sword, is a mistake,<br>\
caused by a mistranscription (of سُفْتُهُ for سِفْتُهُ) in<br>\
art. سيف in some copies of the K.]<br>\
2<br>\
سوّفهُ, (S, M, K,) or سوّف بِهِ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
تَسْوِيفٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) He said to him time<br>\
after time سَوْفَ أَفْعَلُ [I will do such a thing];<br>\
(S, Msb, TA;) derived from the particle سَوْفَ:<br>\
(IJ, M:) and hence, (Msb,) he delayed, or deferred, with him; or put him off with promises;<br>\
syn. مَطَلَهُ; (S, * Msb, K, TA;) saying سَوْفَ أَفْعَلُ;<br>\
(TA;) or promising to be faithful to his engagement; (Msb;) mostly used in relation to a promise<br>\
that is not to be fulfilled; as is said by Ibn-Abi1-Hadeed: (MF, TA:) and ↓ ساوفهُ signifies [the<br>\
same, as is implied in the M, being syn. with]<br>\
مَاطِلَهُ: see an ex. in a verse cited voce سَوْفَ, last<br>\
sentence. (TA.) التَّسْوِيفُ is [also expl. as] Syn. with<br>\
التَّأْخِيرُ [app. as meaning the postponing, putting<br>\
off, delaying, or deferring, anything]. (TA.)<br>\
[And it is implied in art. عظب of the TA that it<br>\
is Syn. with التَّمْرِينُ and التَّصْبِيرُ: so that you say,<br>\
سوّفهُ عَلَيْهِ, meaning He inured, or accustomed,<br>\
him to it; and made him to endure it with<br>\
patience: see سَافَ عَلَيْهِ, above.] ―<br>\
-b2-  You say<br>\
also, سَوَّفْتُهُ أَمْرِى, meaning I made him (a man)<br>\
to have the ordering and deciding of my affair,<br>\
or case, (S, K,) to do what he would: (S:) and<br>\
so سَوَّمْتُهُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, first sentence.<br>\
3<br>\
ساوفهُ: see 1:<br>\
-A2-  and 2.<br>\
-A3-  Also i. q. سَارَّهُ<br>\
[He spoke, or discoursed, secretly to him or with<br>\
him; or acquainted him with a secret]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And ساوف المَرْأَةَ i. q. ضَاجَعَهَا [He slept with the<br>\
woman in, or on, one bed]. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اساف, (S, M, K,) inf. n. إِسَافَةٌ, (TA,) said<br>\
of a man, (S, M,) His cattle perished, or died:<br>\
(S, K:) or he had murrain occurring among his<br>\
cattle: so in a verse of Tufeyl, cited voce اِسْتَرْخَى,<br>\
in art. رخو. (M.) [Hence,] one says, أَسَافَ حتّّى<br>\
مَايَشْتَكِى السَّوَافَ, (AA, S, Meyd, K,) or السُّوَافَ,<br>\
(As, Meyd,) [He had murrain among his cattle<br>\
until he did not complain of the murrain:] a<br>\
prov., (Meyd,) applied to him who has become<br>\
accustomed to casualties; (S, K;) or to him who<br>\
has become inured to calamities, (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
Meyd, A,) so that he is not impatient of the<br>\
vicissitudes of fortune. (A&#39;Obeyd, Meyd.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
اساف الوَالِدَانِ The two parents lost their child by<br>\
his death: in which case, the child is said to be<br>\
↓ مُسَافٌ; and his father, ↓ مُسِيفٌ; and his mother,<br>\
↓ مِسْيَافٌ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
-A2-  اسافهُ اللّٰهُ God destroyed him, or took away his life. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
اساف الخَرْزَ i. q. خَرَمَهُ [i. e. He spoiled the sewing<br>\
of the skin, or hide; as when one uses a thick<br>\
instrument for sewing or perforating, and a thin<br>\
thong; or as when one rends two stitch-holes into<br>\
one]. (M.) And اساف الخَارِزُ The sewer of a<br>\
skin, or hide, perforated, or sewed, in such a<br>\
manner that the two stitch-holes became rent [into<br>\
one]. (A&#39;Obeyd, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِسْتَوَفَ see 1, first and second sentences.<br>\
سَافٌ Any row, or course, (S, M, L, K, TA,)<br>\
[i. e.] a single row, or course, (Mgh,) of bricks,<br>\
(S, M, Mgh, L, K, TA,) or (so in the Mgh, but<br>\
in the TA “ and ”) of clay, (Mgh, TA,) of a<br>\
wall, (S, Mgh, K, TA,) or in a wall, (TA,) or in a<br>\
building; (M, L, TA;) as also مِدْمَاكٌ: (TA:) pl.<br>\
of pauc. آسُفٌ [formed by transposition, like آدُرٌ<br>\
pl. of دَارٌ,] (L,) and سَافَاتٌ: (Mgh:) Lth explains<br>\
السَّافُ as signifying what is between the سَافَات of<br>\
the building: its ا is originally و. (TA.) [سَافَةٌ<br>\
mentioned by Freytag as signifying “ a single<br>\
series of stones in a wall,” on the authority of the<br>\
K, I do not find there, nor in any other lexicon.]<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain bird, that preys. (M.)<br>\
سَوْفَ, for which one also says سَفْ, (M, Mughnee, K,) rejecting the medial radical letter, (M,<br>\
Mughnee,) and سَوْ, (M, Mughnee, K,) rejecting<br>\
the final radical, (M, Mughnee,) and سَىْ, (M,<br>\
Mughnee, K,) rejecting the final radical and<br>\
changing the medial into ى for the purpose of<br>\
alleviation [of the utterance], (M, Mughnee,) and<br>\
accord. to the L سَا, (TA,) is a particle, (IJ, M,<br>\
K,) denoting inception; (K;) or a word denoting<br>\
تَنْفِيس, (Sb, S, M, K,) i. e. amplification, because<br>\
it changes the aor. from the strait time, which is<br>\
the present, to the ample time, which is the future;<br>\
(Mughnee voce سَ [q. v.];) i. e., denoting تنفيس<br>\
with respect to that which has not yet happened;<br>\
(Sb, S, K;) and postponement; (M;) and is used<br>\
in terrifying and threatening and promising;<br>\
(IDrd, K;) or it is a word denoting promising or<br>\
threatening: (Msb:) it is syn. with سَ accord. to<br>\
some, or has a larger meaning than this latter<br>\
accord. to others. (Mughnee.) You say, سَوْفَ<br>\
أَفْعَلُ [I will do such a thing]. (Sb, S.) And one<br>\
may not introduce a separating word between it<br>\
and its verb, [except in a case mentioned in what<br>\
follows,] because it occupies the place of the س<br>\
in سَيَفْعَلُ [&amp;c.]. (Sb, S.) [But] it is distinct from<br>\
سَ by its [sometimes] having ل prefixed to it;<br>\
as in [the phrase in the Kur xciii. 5], وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ<br>\
رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَى [And thy Lord will give thee, and<br>\
thou wilt be well pleased]: (Mughnee:) in this<br>\
phrase, [however,] the ل is [considered as] pre-<br>\
fixed to the verb, not to the particle: (M:) or the<br>\
phrase is elliptical, for لَأَنْتَ سَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ. (Bd.)<br>\
And it is distinct from سَ in this, that it is sometimes separated [from its verb] by a verb divested<br>\
of government both as to the letter and the meaning; as in the saying,<br>\
وَمَا أَدْرِى وَسَوْفَ إِخَالُ أَدْرِى<br>\
أَقَوْمٌ آلُ حِصْنٍ أَمْ نِسَآءُ<br>\
[And I know not, but I shall, I think, know,<br>\
whether the family of Hisn be a company of men<br>\
or women]. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b2-  When you desire to<br>\
make it a subst., [i. e. to use it as a subst.,] you<br>\
make it to have tenween [when it is indeterminate]. (IDrd, K.) IDrd cites as an ex.,<br>\
إِنَّ سَوْفًا وَإِنَّ لَيْتًا عَنَآءٌ<br>\
[Verily سَوْفَ and verily لَيْتَ are a weariness]:<br>\
but one reading is إِنَّ لَوًّا; and another, إِنَّ لَيْتًا<br>\
وإِنَّ لَوًّا; and there is no such reading as إِنَّ سَوْفًا.<br>\
(O, TA.) One says also, فُلَانٌ يَقْتَاتُ السَّوْفَ [lit.<br>\
Such a one feeds upon the word سَوْفَ]; meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  Such a one lives by means of things hoped for:<br>\
(S, K, TA:) and in like manner, مَا قُوتُهُ إِلَّا السَّوْفُ<br>\
[lit. His food is not anything but, or other than,<br>\
the word سَوْفَ]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  In the following<br>\
verse of Ibn-Mukbil, cited by Sb,<br>\
بِسَوْفٍ مِنْ تَحِيَّتِهَا ↓ لَوْ سَاوَفَتْنَا<br>\
سَوْفَ العَيُوفِ لَرَاحَ الرَّكْبُ قَدْ قَنِعَا<br>\
[Had she put us off with a سَوْفَ as part of her<br>\
greeting, with the putting off even of such as is<br>\
affected with dislike, the riders had gone contented], سَوْفَ is put in the accus. case [for مُسَاوَفَةَ,<br>\
i. e.] as an inf. n. with the augmentation [meaning<br>\
the augmentative letters] rejected. (M.)<br>\
سِيفَةٌ: see مَسَافَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
سَوَافٌ The [cucumber commonly called] قِثَّآء<br>\
[q. v.]: (M, K, TA:) so says AHn, (M, TA,) on<br>\
the authority of Et-Toosee. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
what next follows.<br>\
سُوَافٌ and ↓ سَوَافٌ; with damm accord. to As,<br>\
and so, he says, all the names of diseases, as نُحَازٌ<br>\
and دُكَاعٌ and قُلَابٌ and خُمَالٌ [&amp;c.]; accord. to<br>\
AA, not so, but with fet-h, and in like manner<br>\
said &#39;Omárah Ibn-&#39;Akeel; (S;) or none relates<br>\
it with fet-h except AA, and his relation is<br>\
nought; (IB;) Disease of cattle, and death<br>\
thereof: (S:) or each signifies death among mankind and cattle: (M:) or the latter, a mortality,<br>\
or murrain, among camels; or so the former: or<br>\
the latter, a mortality among mankind and<br>\
cattle: (K:) and the former, disease of camels;<br>\
(AHn, M, K;) and so the latter. (K.) One says,<br>\
وَقَعَ فِى المَالِ سَوَافٌ [or سُوَافٌ] Death [or a murrain] happened among the cattle. (S.)<br>\
مَسَافٌ The nose: because one smells (يُسَافُ, K,<br>\
i. e. يُشَمُّ, TA) with it: (K:) so in the Moheet.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also مَسَافَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
مُسَافٌ A child taken from his parents by death:<br>\
see 4. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
مُسِيفَ A man whose cattle have died. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And A father having lost his child by death:<br>\
see 4. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
مَسَافَةٌ [properly A place of smelling: ―<br>\
-b2-  and<br>\
hence,] (tropical:)  Distance; (S, K, TA;) and ↓ مَسَافٌ and<br>\
↓ سِيفَةٌ signify the same in this sense [or in others<br>\
here following]: (K:) [a space, or tract, or an<br>\
extent, over which one journeys:] a far-extending<br>\
tract that one traverses: originally a place of<br>\
smelling of the guides, in order that they may<br>\
know whether it be far or near, out of the way or<br>\
in the right way: (A, TA:) or a [desert, or such<br>\
as is termed] مَفَازَة: (M:) said to be from سَافَ<br>\
الشَّىْءَ meaning “ he smelled the thing; ” for the<br>\
guide smells the dust of the place wherein he is;<br>\
and if he smell the odour of urine and dung of<br>\
camels, he knows that he [or some other] has<br>\
traversed it; but otherwise, not: (Msb:) or because the guide, when he is in a desert, (S, M, K,)<br>\
and has lost his way therein, (M,) smells its<br>\
dust, (S, M, K,) in order that he may know, (S,<br>\
K,) or and thus knows, (M,) whether he be in<br>\
the right way, (S, M, K,) or not: (S, K:) then,<br>\
by reason of frequency of usage of this word [as<br>\
meaning “ a place of smelling of the guides ”] it<br>\
became a term for “ distance: ” (S, K:) pl. مَسَاوِفُ<br>\
(A, TA) and مَسَافَاتٌ. (Msb.) One says, كَمْ<br>\
مَسَافَةُ هٰذِهِ الأَرْضِ and ↓ مَسَافُهَا and ↓ سِيفَتُهَا (tropical:)  [How<br>\
long is the distance, or how much is the extent, of<br>\
this land?]. (TA.) And بَيْنَهُمْ مَسَافَةٌ بَعِيدَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Between them is a far-extending distance or space].<br>\
(Msb.) And بَيْنَنَا مَسَافَةُ عِشْرِينَ يَوْمًا (tropical:)  [Between<br>\
us is the distance, or space, of twenty days].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  In the following saying of Dhu-rRummeh, it is doubly tropical:<br>\
وَأَبْعَدُهُمْ مَسَافَةَ غَوْرِ عَقْلٍ<br>\
إِذَا مَا الأَمْرُ ذُو الشُّبُهَاتِ عَالَا<br>\
(tropical:)  (tropical:)  [And the furthest of them in the extent of the<br>\
depth of intelligence when the affair, or case, in<br>\
which are dubiousnesses overcomes and is onerous].<br>\
(A, TA.)<br>\
مُسَوِّفٌ One who does what he will, [as though<br>\
he said time after time سَوْفَ أَفْعَلُ,] whom no one<br>\
will make to turn back. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, with ة, A<br>\
woman who will not comply with the desire of her<br>\
husband when he calls her to his bed, and strives<br>\
with him to repel him in respect of that which he<br>\
desires of her, and says سَوْفَ أَفْعَلُ: such is said,<br>\
in a trad., to be cursed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, with ة,<br>\
A well (رَكِيَّةٌ) of which one says, Water will be<br>\
found (سَوْفَ يُوجَدُ) in it: or of which the water<br>\
is smelt (يُسَافُ), and disliked, and loathed. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, Z, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And, without ة, Very patient<br>\
or enduring. (TA.)<br>\
مُسْتَافٌ A place of smelling, or that is smelt.<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\
مِسْيَافٌ A mother having lost her child by<br>\
death: see 4. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
إِنَّهَا لَمُسَاوِفَةٌ لِلسَّيْرِ [app. referring to a she-camel]<br>\
Verily she is one that has ability for journeying.<br>\
