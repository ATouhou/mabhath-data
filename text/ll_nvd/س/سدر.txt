سَدَرَ, inf. n. سَدَرٌ and سَدَارَةٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
He became dazzled by a thing at which he looked,<br>\
so that he turned away his face from it: or<br>\
became confounded, or perplexed, and unable to<br>\
see his right course: syn. تَحَيَّرَ: (K:) and he (a<br>\
camel) became dazzled by a thing at which he<br>\
looked, so that he turned away his face from it,<br>\
by reason of intense heat: (S, * K:) also, (TA,)<br>\
or سَدِرَ بَصَرُهُ, (M,) he [app. a man or any animal]<br>\
was hardly able to see: (M, TA:) or سَدِرَ بَصَرُهُ<br>\
he was dazzled, or confounded or perplexed, and<br>\
did not see well; as also ↓ اِسْمَدَرَّ. (A, TA.) [See<br>\
also سَدَرٌ, below.]<br>\
-A2-  سَدَرَ, (M, K,) or سَدَرَتْ,<br>\
(S,) aor.<br>\
سَدُرَ, inf. n. سَدْرٌ, (M,) He, or she, let<br>\

hair; (S, M, K;) and in like manner, a curtain,<br>\
or veil, (M,) and a garment; (Lh;) a dial. var.<br>\
of سَدَلَ. (S, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also سَدَرَ, aor.<br>\
سَدِرَ, inf. n.<br>\
سَدْرٌ and سُدُورٌ, He rent his garment. (Yaa-<br>\
koob, M.)<br>\

اسدرتِ الشَّمْسُ عَيْنَهُ [The sun dazzled his<br>\
eye, and confused his sight]. (K in art. جهر.)<br>\
5<br>\
تسدّر بِثَوْبِهِ He covered himself with his<br>\
garment. (AA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انسدر It (hair, S, M, K, and a curtain or<br>\
veil, M) hung down; (S, M, K;) a dial. var. of<br>\
انسدل. (S, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  انسدر يَعْدُو He was somewhat quick, or made some haste, running: (S,<br>\
M: *) or he went down, or downwards, and<br>\
persevered (A &#39;Obeyd, K) in his running, going<br>\
quickly. (A &#39;Obeyd.) [In the CK, for يعدو, is<br>\
put by mistake بَعُدَ.]<br>\
Q. Q. 4<br>\
اِسْمَدَرَّ بَصَرُهُ His sight became weak,<br>\
in the manner described below, voce سَمَادِيرُ. (S<br>\
in art. سدر, and M and K in art. سمدر.) It is of<br>\
the measure اِفْمَعَلَّ, from السَّدَرُ; (IKtt;) the م<br>\
being augmentative. (S.) See also سَدِرَ. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
اسمدرّت عَيْنُهُ His eye shed tears; accord. to Lh;<br>\
but this is not known in the classical language.<br>\
(M in art. سمدر.)<br>\
سِدْرٌ [a coll. gen. n., The species of lote-tree<br>\
called by Linnæus rhamnus spina Christi; and<br>\
by Forskål, rhamnus nabeca;] the tree, or trees,<br>\
of which the fruit is called نَبِق and نَبْق: (S, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K:) sing., (Msb,) or [rather] n. un.,<br>\
(S, M, K,) سِدْرَةٌ: (S, M, Msb, K:) and sometimes سِدْرٌ is used as meaning the smallest or<br>\
smaller of numbers [generally denoting from<br>\
three to ten inclusively]: (Ibn-Es-Sarráj, Msb:)<br>\
AHn says, accord. to Aboo-Ziyád, the سِدْر is of<br>\
the kind called عِضَاه, and is of two species, عُبْرِىٌّ<br>\
and ضَالٌ: the عبرى is that which has no thorns<br>\
except such as do not hurt: the ضال has thorns<br>\
[which hurt]: the سدر has a broad round leaf:<br>\
and sometimes people alight and rest beneath a<br>\
tree of this kind; but the ضال is small: the best<br>\
نبق that is known in the land of the Arabs is in<br>\
Hejer (هَجَر), in a single piece of land which is<br>\
appropriated to the Sultán alone: it is the sweetest of all in taste and odour: the mouth of him<br>\
who eats it, and the garments of him who has it<br>\
upon him, diffuse an odour like that of perfume:<br>\
(M, TA:) it is [also] said that the سدر is of two<br>\
species; whereof one grows in the cultivated lands,<br>\
and its leaves are used in the ablution termed<br>\
غُسْل, and its fruit is sweet; and the other grows<br>\
in the desert, and its leaves are not so used, and<br>\
its fruit is juicy: the زُعْرُور is so described that<br>\
it may be supposed to be the wild نبق: (Msb:)<br>\
when سِدْرٌ is used absolutely, with relation to the<br>\
ablution termed غُسْل, it means the ground leaves<br>\
of the tree so called: (Mgh, * Msb:) the pl. of<br>\
سِدْرَةٌ is سِدْرَاتٌ and سِدِرَاتٌ and سِدَرَاتٌ (S, K)<br>\
and سِدَرٌ (S, M, K) and سُدُورٌ, (M, K,) which<br>\
last is extr. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سِدْرَةُ المُنْتَهَى is said to be<br>\
The lote-tree in the Seventh Heaven; (Lth, K; *)<br>\
beyond which neither angel nor prophet passes,<br>\
and which shades the water and Paradise: (Lth:)<br>\
in the Saheeh it is said to be in the Sixth<br>\
Heaven: &#39;Iyád reconciles the two assertions by<br>\
the supposition that its root is in the Sixth, and<br>\
that it rises over the Seventh: accord. to IAth, it<br>\
is in the furthest part of Paradise to which, as<br>\
its furthest limit, extends the knowledge of ancients<br>\
and moderns. (MF, TA.)<br>\
سَدَرٌ [see 1]. You say, فِى بَصَرِهِ سَدَرٌ, and<br>\
↓ سَمَادِيرُ, In his sight is a confusedness, so that he<br>\
does not see well. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Some say that it signifies<br>\
An affection resembling vertigo, common to a<br>\
voyager upon the sea: or [simply] vertigo. (TA<br>\
in art. بقل.)<br>\
سَدِرٌ Having his eyes dazzled by a thing, so<br>\
that he turns away his face from it: or in a<br>\
state of confusion or perplexity, and unable to see<br>\
his right course: syn. مُتَحَيِّرٌ: (K:) as also ↓ سَادِرٌ:<br>\
(S, K:) and the former, a camel having his eyes<br>\
dazzled by a thing, so that he turns away his<br>\
face from it, by reason of intense heat: (S:) and<br>\
also one having his eyes dazzled by snow; as well<br>\
as by intense heat. (IAar.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَيْنُهُ سَدِرَةٌ His<br>\
eye is confused in its vision, or dazzled, so that<br>\
he cannot see well. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And سَدِرَةٌ means An<br>\
old and weak she-camel. (IAar, TA in art. سد.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Also سَدِرٌ The sea: (S, M, K:) one of the<br>\
[proper] names thereof; (S;) occurring only in a<br>\
poem of Umeiyeh Ibn-Abi-s-Salt: (M:) he says,<br>\
فَكَأَنَّ بِرْقِعَ وَالمَلَائِكُ حَوْلَهُ<br>\
سَدِرٌ تَوَاكَلُهُ القَوَائِمُ أَجْرَدُ<br>\
[And as though the first heaven, with the angels<br>\
around it, were the sea, the winds deserting it,<br>\
and smooth]: (S, M, TA: [but in the M and TA,<br>\
for حَوْلَهُ, we find حَوْلَهَا; and in the S, for أَجْرَدُ,<br>\
we find أَجْرَبُ, which is inconsistent with the<br>\
rhyme of the poem:]) by القوائم he means the<br>\
winds; and by تواكله, [for تَتَوَاكَلُهُ,] تَرَكَتْهُ [or<br>\
rather تَتْرُكُهُ]: he likens the sky to the sea when<br>\
calm: (TA:) Th quotes thus:<br>\
وَكَأَنَّ بِرْقِعَ وَالمَلَائِكُ تَحْتَهَا<br>\
سَدِرٌ تَوَاكَلُهُ قَوَائِمُ أَرْبَعُ<br>\
and says that the poet likens the angels, with<br>\
respect to their fear of God, to a man affected<br>\
with a vertigo [lit., turning round, though it<br>\
would seem more appropriate had he said, the<br>\
poet likens them to a camel so affected, whom<br>\
his four legs failed: he prefaces this explanation<br>\
with the words, سَدِرٌ يَدُورُ وَقَوَائِمُ أَرْبَعُ هُمُ المَلَائِكَةُ;<br>\
to which he or ISd adds, لَا يَدْرِى كَيْفَ خَلْقُهُم:<br>\
but (using a common phrase of ISd) I can only say,<br>\
لَا أَدْرِى كَيْفَ هٰذَا; unless there be some omission<br>\
in the transcription]: (M, TA:) Sgh says that<br>\
the correct reading is سِدْرٌ, meaning the kind of<br>\
tree so called, not the sea; and the author of the<br>\
Námoos adopts his opinion; but MF rejects it:<br>\
(TA:) some read رَقْعًا [in the place of برقع] and<br>\
explain it as meaning the seventh heaven. (TA<br>\
in art. رقع.)<br>\
سِدْرِىٌّ One who grinds and sells the leaves of<br>\
the سِدْر. (TA.) [See also سَدَّارٌ.]<br>\
سِدَارٌ A thing resembling a [curtain of the kind<br>\
called] خِدْر: (K:) or resembling a كِلَّة, which<br>\
is put across a [tent of the kind called] خِبَآء. (M.)<br>\
سَدَّارٌ A seller of the leaves of the سِدْر. (TA.)<br>\
[See also سِدْرِىٌّ.]<br>\
سَادِرٌ: see سَدِرٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Losing his way: you<br>\
say, إِنَّهُ سَادِرٌ فِى الغَىِّ Verily he is losing his way,<br>\
in error. (A.) And أَتَى أَمْرَهُ سَادِرًا i. e. [He<br>\
entered into, or did, his affair] in a wrong way.<br>\
(Ham p. 432.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A man without firmness, or<br>\
deliberation. (M.) You say, تَكَلَّمَ سَادِرًا He spoke<br>\
without deliberation. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  A man who cares<br>\
not for anything, nor minds what he does: (S, *<br>\
M, K:) or one who occupies himself with vain or<br>\
frivolous diversion. (TA.)<br>\
سُمْدُورٌ A cloudiness of the eye; (K;) and<br>\
weakness of sight: (TA:) and سَمَادِيرُ [originally<br>\
pl. of the preceding, app.,] weakness of sight, (S,<br>\
M, K,) or something appearing to a man by<br>\
reason of weakness of his sight, (M, K,) on the<br>\
occasion of, (S, M,) or [arising] from, (K,)<br>\
intoxication (S, M, K) by drink &amp;c., (M,) and<br>\
from [or if the reading in the CK be correct this<br>\
prep. should be omitted] the insensibility arising<br>\
from drowsiness and vertigo. (S, K.) The م is<br>\
augmentative. (S: but the word is mentioned in<br>\
the M and K in art. سمدر.) See also سَدَرٌ.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also A king: because the eyes become weak,<br>\
or dazzled, in consequence of looking at him.<br>\
(K in art. سمدر.)<br>\
الأَسْدَرَانِ The shoulder-joints, (S, M, A, K,)<br>\
and the sides: (S, K:) or (so in the M, but<br>\
accord. to the K “ and ”) two veins (M, K) in<br>\
the eye, (M,) or in the two eyes: (K:) or beneath<br>\
the temples. (M.) Hence the saying جَآءَ يَضْرِبُ<br>\
أَسْدَرَيْهِ He came beating (with his hands, TA)<br>\
his shoulder-joints (S, A, K) and his sides; (S,<br>\
K;) meaning, (tropical:)  he came empty, (S, A, K,)<br>\
having nothing in his hand, (S,) or having no<br>\
occupation, (M,) and without having accomplished the object of his desire: (S, K:) and in<br>\
like manner, أَصْدَرَيْهِ: (S:) and جَآءَ يَنْفُضُ أَسْدَرَيْهِ,<br>\
(AZ,) and أَصْدَرَيْهِ, (TA,) and أَزْدَرَيْهِ, (ISk,) he<br>\
came shaking his shoulder-joints: (AZ:) or his<br>\
sides: meaning as above. (TA.)<br>\
مَسْدُورٌ Hair [let down, or made to hang down,<br>\
or] hanging down; like مَسْدُولٌ. (TA.)<br>\
مُسْمَدِرٌّ A dazzled eye. (TA in art. سمدر.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
A long and direct road. (K ibid.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,<br>\
(TA ibid.,) (assumed tropical:)  Right speech or language. (K and<br>\
TA ibid.)<br>\
