سَاطَهُ, [aor. يَسُوطُ,] (M,) inf. n. سَوْطٌ, (S, M,<br>\
K,) He mixed it, (S, M, K,) one part with<br>\
another, (S,) and stirred it about, and beat it;<br>\
(M;) as also ↓ سوّطهُ, (M, K, *) inf. n. تَسْوِيطٌ:<br>\
(K:) or سَوْطٌ signifies the putting together two<br>\
things in a vessel, then beating them with the<br>\
hand until they become mixed: (Jm, K:) or,<br>\
accord. to some, it relates particularly to a cooking-pot, when its contents are mixed: (M:) you<br>\
say, سَاطَ قِدْرَهُ بِالمِسْوَطِ [he mixed, and stirred<br>\
about, and beat, the contents of his cooking-pot<br>\
with the مِسْوَط, q. v.]: (TA:) but you say also,<br>\
سَاطَ الهَرِيسَةَ, and ↓ سَوَّطَهَا, he stirred about the [food<br>\
called] هريسة with a piece of wood, in order that<br>\
it might become mixed: (TA:) or ↓ سوّطهُ signifies he mixed it much. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] سِيطَ<br>\
حُبُّكَ بِدَمِى and مِنْ دَمِى (assumed tropical:)  [The love of thee is<br>\
mixed with my blood]. (TA.) And هُوَ يَسْوطُ الأَمْرَ<br>\

And فُلَانٌ يَسُوطُ الحَرْبَ and ↓ يُسَوِّطُهَا (assumed tropical:)  Such a<br>\
one superintends, manages, or conducts, in person,<br>\
the war. (A, TA.) And فُلَانٌ أُمُورَهُ ↓ سَوَّطَ, inf. n.<br>\
as above, (S, TA,) (tropical:)  Such a one rendered his<br>\
affairs confused, or disordered, or perplexed:<br>\
(TA:) and in like manner, رَأْيَهُ [his opinion].<br>\
(M.) And أَمْرَهُ ↓ سَوَّطَ (tropical:)  He created confusion, or<br>\
disorder, in his affair, or case. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
سَاطَهُ, (M,) aor. يَسُوطُ, (S,) inf. n. سَوْطٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
He whipped him; struck him with a سَوْط; (S,<br>\

-b2-<br>\
سَاوَطَنِى فَسُطْتُهُ: see 3.<br>\
2<br>\
سَوَّطَ see 1, in six places.<br>\
-A2-  سَوَّطَ الكُرَّاثُ, (M, K,)<br>\
inf. n. تَسْوِيطٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  The leeks put forth their<br>\
سِيَاط [or seed-stalks: see سَوْطٌ]. (M, K, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
سَاْوَطَ ↓ سَاوَطَنِى فَسُطْتُهُ, aor. of the latter أَسُوطُهُ:<br>\
thus mentioned by Lh, without any addition:<br>\
app. meaning He acted roughly with me with<br>\
his whip, or he contended with me therewith, and<br>\
I overcame him [with my whip]: a mode of expression which is rare in relation to substances;<br>\
rather relating to accidents, or attributes. (M.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِسْتَوَطَ 2, which is extr., [for by rule it should<br>\
be اِسْتَاطَ,] It (a thing) was, or became, mixed.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اِسْتَوَطَ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرُهُ (tropical:)  His affair,<br>\
or case, was, or became, confused, or disordered,<br>\
to him. (M, K, * TA.)<br>\
سَوْطٌ [A whip;] a certain thing, (S, M,)<br>\
namely, plaited skin, (Bd in lxxxix. 12,) [or a<br>\
lash,] with which one beats, or strikes, (S, M,)<br>\
well known; (Msb;) i. q. مِقْرَعَةٌ: (K:) so called<br>\
because it mixes the flesh with the blood (IDrd,<br>\
M, K) when a man or a beast is struck with it;<br>\
(IDrd, TA;) or because its several component<br>\
parts are mixed together: (Bd, ubi suprà:) pl.<br>\
[of pauc.] أَسْوَاطٌ and [of mult.] سِيَاطٌ: (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K:) the latter originally سِوَاطٌ. (TA.) The<br>\
saying ضَرَبْتُ زَيْدًا سَوْطًا means ضَرَبْتُ زَيْدًا بِسَوْطٍ<br>\
[I struck Zeyd with a whip]: (M, Msb: *) or it<br>\
is one of those rare instances in which a prefixed<br>\
n. is suppressed; being originally ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبَةَ سَوْطٍ<br>\
[I struck him a stroke, or lash, of a whip], meaning ضَرْبَةً بِسَوْطٍ [a stroke, or lash, with a whip]:<br>\
(M:) or ضَرْبَةً وَاحِدَةً بِسَوْطٍ [one stroke, or lash,<br>\
with a whip]. (Mgh.) One says also, ضَرَبَهُ مِائَةَ<br>\
سَوْطٍ [He struck him a hundred strokes, or lashes,<br>\
of the whip]. (S and K in art. سحل.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In the<br>\
Kur [lxxxix. 12], where it is said, فَصَبَّ عَلَيْهِمْ<br>\
رَبُّكَ سَوْطَ عَذَابٍ, (S, Msb,) it signifies (tropical:)  A portion,<br>\
or share: (S, K:) or (S, Msb, but in the K,<br>\
“ and ”) (tropical:)  vehemence, or severity; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
as being likened to the paining of a whip; (Msb;)<br>\
because punishment is sometimes with the سَوْط;<br>\
(S;) and this word is used by the Arabs to denote<br>\
every kind of punishment when it is extreme,<br>\
though there be in it no beating: (Fr:) [therefore,] the above-cited saying in the Kur means,<br>\
(tropical:)  [And thy Lord poured upon them a portion,<br>\
or a share, or vehemence, or severity, of punishment: or it means,] a mixture; prepared for them,<br>\
of various punishments: or it is designed to show<br>\
that what befell them in the present world was,<br>\
in comparison with what is prepared for them in<br>\
the final state, like the whip in comparison with<br>\
the sword: (Bd:) or the meaning is (assumed tropical:)  a kind of<br>\
punishment. (Jel.) [Agreeably with this last explanation, it is said that] the phrase هُمَا يَتَعَاطَيَانِ<br>\
سَوْطًا وَاحِدًا means (tropical:)  They two are agreed upon<br>\
one mode: (A:) or the meaning is (tropical:)  [they two<br>\
enter, or plunge, into; or venture boldly upon,<br>\
and do;] one thing, or affair; (S, and K; but<br>\
wanting in one copy of the former; and in the<br>\
latter, in the place of هما is put ما;) i. e., one sort<br>\
[of thing or affair]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [قِيدُ سَوْطٍ The measure of a whip, i. e. a whip&#39;s length, is an astronomical measure, which seems, from several instances that I have noted, in the work of Kzw &amp;c.,<br>\
to be the same as رُمْحٌ is in modern usage; i. e.<br>\
four degrees and a half, by rule; but, like the<br>\
latter, not precise nor uniform in every instance.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  [The pl.] سِيَاطٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The seed-stalks<br>\
of leeks; (TK;) the stalks, of leeks, upon which are<br>\
the زَمَالِيق thereof: (M, K:) so called as being<br>\
likened to the سياط with which one strikes. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And سَوْطٌ signifies also (tropical:)  A remaining portion<br>\
(A, K) of water, (A,) or of a pool of water left<br>\
by a torrent, (K, [in some copies of which الغَدِيل<br>\
is erroneously put for الغَدِير,]) extended like the<br>\
سَوْط [with which one strikes]: (A:) pl. سِيَاطٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  A place where water collects and<br>\
stagnates: (K:) pl. أَسْوَاطٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And (tropical:)  A<br>\
road, or track, of little width, between two elevations: pl. أَسْيَاطٌ [or سِيَاطٌ?] and أًسْوَاطٌ: so in the<br>\
A: but some say شَوْطٌ, q. v. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
kind of tent, of [goats&#39;] hair. (Ibn-El-Kelbee,<br>\
TA voce بَيْتٌ, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And سَوْطُ بَاطِلٍ (tropical:)  Light<br>\
entering from an aperture in a wall, in sunshine;<br>\
(K, TA;) also termed خَيْطُ بَاطِلٍ: but as some<br>\
say, with ش. (TA: and it is mentioned with<br>\
ش in art. شوط in the S, and again in the K.)<br>\
سَوِيطٌ; fem. with ة: see مَسُوطٌ.<br>\
سَوَّاطٌ The شُرَطِىّ [or officer of the prefect of<br>\
police] who has with him the سَوْط [or whip]. (TA.)<br>\
مَسَوطٌ Mixed. (TA.) So in a trad. of &#39;Alee<br>\
with Fátimeh, [in which the former expresses the<br>\
intimacy of her union with him, as though they<br>\
two were one person,] مَسُوطٌ لَحْمُهَا بِدَمِى وَلَحْمِى<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Her flesh is blended and mixed with my blood<br>\
and my flesh. (TA.) You say also, أَمْوَالُهُمْ<br>\
بَيْنَهُمْ ↓ سَوِيطَةٌ Their possessions are mixed among<br>\
them; (AZ, S, K;) i. q. ↓ مُسْتَوطَةٌ. (M.)<br>\
مِسْوَطٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
مِسْوَاطٌ A thing with which one mixes a thing,<br>\
(S, * M, K,) and stirs it about; (M;) i. e., a<br>\
stick, or the like, used for that purpose; as also<br>\
↓ مِسْوَطٌ. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  A horse that will not put forth<br>\
his power of running unless by means of the whip;<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád and K; and so in a copy of the S,<br>\
on the authority of AO, but omitted in another<br>\
copy;) as though (TA) keeping it in store.<br>\
(S, TA.)<br>\
