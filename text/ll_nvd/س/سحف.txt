(S, K, TA;) namely, a thing; (TA;) and [particularly] the fat from the back (S, K) of the<br>\
sheep or goat, (S, TA,) not of the she-camel, as is<br>\
indicated by the context in the K, (TA,) by<br>\
reason of its abundance, after which he roasted<br>\
it, (S, TA,) i. e., accord. to the S, the fat, but<br>\
correctly the sheep or goat: (TA:) so says ISK.<br>\
(S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And سَحَفَهُ, (Lth, TA,) inf. n. as<br>\
above, (Lth, K, TA,) He removed it, or stripped<br>\
it off, namely, hair from skin, so that none of<br>\

سَحْفٌ Fat, as a subst.: pl. سِحَافٌ. (TA.)<br>\
An Arab of the desert said, أَتَوْنَا بِصِحَافٍ فِيهَا لِحَامٌ<br>\
وَسِحَافٌ They brought us bowls in which were<br>\
sorts of flesh-meat and of fat. (IAar K, * TA.)<br>\
سَحْفَةٌ A piece, or portion, of fat; in a general<br>\
sense: (TA:) or the portion of fat that is upon<br>\
the back, (S, K, TA,) sticking to the skin, in the<br>\
part between the two shoulder-blades, extending<br>\
to the haunches: so says ISk: (S, TA:) or that<br>\
is upon the two sides and the back: and it is<br>\
never but from fatness: accord. to IKh, it is in<br>\
all beasts except the camel: ISd says that, accord.<br>\
to some, it is in the camel [also]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[the dual] سَحْفَتَانِ The two sides of the tuft of<br>\
hair that is between the lower lip and the chin:<br>\
(Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, K:) pl. سَحَفَاتٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also سَحِيفٌ.<br>\
-A3-  [Freytag makes it to be also syn.<br>\
with مَسْحَفٌ, as on the authority of the K, in<br>\
which I do not find it in this sense.]<br>\
سُحَفَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
سُحَفْنِيَةٌ (in which the ن is augmentative, TA)<br>\
A man having the head shaven; (IB, K, TA;) as<br>\
also ↓ سُحَفَةٌ. (IB, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And with the article<br>\
ال, What one has shaven off: thus it is sometimes a subst.; and sometimes, [i. e. in the former<br>\
sense,] an epithet. (IB, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain<br>\
beast, or creeping thing: (Seer, TA:) [SM says,]<br>\
I think it is the سُلَحْفِيَة [or tortoise]. (TA.)<br>\
سُحَافٌ Consumption; or ulceration of the<br>\
lungs; syn. سِلٌّ. (S, K.)<br>\
سَحُوفٌ A bucket (دَلْو) that takes, and bears<br>\
away, the water that is in a well. (Seer, K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also, applied to a she-camel, Of which the fat<br>\
has gone away. (ISd, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, applied to<br>\
a sheep or goat, or to a ewe or she-goat, (شَاة,)<br>\
Having a portion of fat such as is termed سَحْفَة,<br>\
or two such portions of fat; as also ↓ أُسْحُوفٌ:<br>\
(TA:) or, so applied, (S,) and applied to a she-camel, (S, K,) and to a he-camel, (K,) having<br>\
abundance of سَحَائِف, (S, * K, TA,) pl. of سَحِيفَةٌ<br>\
[q. v.]; or having abundance of the fat termed<br>\
سَحْفَة. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A she-camel long in the<br>\
teats. (IDrd, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A she-camel narrow<br>\
in the orifices of the teats. (IDrd, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\

along; (K, TA;) so say some; i. e., by reason of<br>\
fatigue: a dial. var. of زَحُوفٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And A<br>\
sheep, or ewe, thin in the wool of the belly. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  In the K, three other meanings are erroneously assigned to this word; one of them<br>\
belonging to سَحِيفَةٌ, and each of the others to<br>\
سَحِيفٌ. (TA.)<br>\
سَحِيفٌ, (ISk, S, Sgh, TA,) accord. to the context in the K سَحُوفٌ, which is wrong, in this and<br>\
the next sense, (TA,) The sound of the mill when<br>\
one grinds. (ISk, S, Sgh, K *) And The sound<br>\
of the streaming of milk from the udder; (O, K, *<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ سَحْفَةٌ. (K, * TA.)<br>\

off from the back of a sheep or goat. (ISk, S.)<br>\

of the flanks: and similar wide portions of fat<br>\
that are seen adhering to the skin. (Lth, K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A rain (مَطْرَةٌ) that sweeps away<br>\
that along which it passes: (S, O, L, TA:) in<br>\
the K, by the omission of كَسَفِينَةٍ, this meaning<br>\
is erroneously assigned to سَحُوفٌ: accord. to As,<br>\
a sharp rain, that sweeps away everything: and<br>\
سَحِيقَةٌ, with ق, a vehement rain, consisting of<br>\
large drops, but of little width: pls. سَحَائِفُ and<br>\
سَحَائِقُ. (TA.)<br>\
أُسْحُوفٌ: see سَحُوفٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  أُسْحُوفُ الأَحَالِيلِ, (K,)<br>\
mentioned by ISh, on the authority of Aboo-Aslam, (TA,) and إِسْحَوْفُ الاحاليل, (K,) thus<br>\
accord. to Sb, (TA,) A she-camel wide in the<br>\
orifices of the teats: (Aboo-Aslam, K:) or having<br>\
much milk, the streaming of which causes a sound<br>\
to be heard. (Aboo-Málik, K, * TA.)<br>\

is pared. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
