سَلُ3َ, (S, M,)<br>\
inf. n. سَلٌّ; (S, M, Mgh, K;) and ↓ استلّهُ, (M,)<br>\
inf. n. اِسْتِلَالٌ; (K; [in the CK, الِاسْلال is put<br>\
in the place of الِاسْتِلَال;]) He drew the thing<br>\
out or forth from another thing: (Jel in xxiii. 12:)<br>\
or he pulled out the thing, or drew it forth, gently:<br>\
(M, K: *) or he drew, or pulled, the thing out, or<br>\
forth, as a sword from its scabbard, and a hair<br>\
from dough. (Mgh.) You say, سَلَّ السَّيْفَ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) aor. and inf. n. as above; (Msb;) and<br>\
↓ استلّهُ, both signifying the same; (S;) [i. e. He<br>\
drew the sword;] as also ↓ اسلّهُ, inf. n. إِسْلَالٌ.<br>\
(TA.) In the saying of El-Farezdak,<br>\
غَدَاةَ تَوَلَّيْتُمْ كَانَّ سُيُوفَكُمْ<br>\
↓ ذَآنِينُ فِى أَعْنَاقِكُمْ لَمْ تُسَلْسَلِ<br>\
[In the morning when ye turned back, as though<br>\
your swords were ذآنين (pl. of ذُؤْنُونٌ a species<br>\
of fungus) upon your necks, (for the sword was<br>\
hung upon the shoulder, not by a waist-belt,) not<br>\
drawn forth], he has separated the doubled letter:<br>\
thus the verse is related by IAar: but by Th,<br>\
↓ لَمْ تَسَلَّلِ [for تَتَنَسَلَّلِ]. (M.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
لَأَسُلَّنَّكَ مِنْهُمْ كَمَا تُسَلُّ الشَّعْرَةُ مِنَ العَجِينِ [I will<br>\
assuredly draw thee forth from them like as the<br>\
single hair is drawn forth from dough]. (TA.)<br>\
And in another trad., اَللّٰهُمَّ أْسْلُلْ سَخِيمَةَ قَلْبِى<br>\
(tropical:)  [O God, draw forth the rancour of my heart]:<br>\
and hence the saying الهَدَايَا تَسُلُّ السَّخَائِمَ وَتَحُلُّ<br>\
الشَّكَائِمَ (tropical:)  [Presents draw away feelings of rancour, and loose, or melt, resistances, or incompliances]. (TA.) And سُلَّ, said of a colt, means<br>\
He was drawn forth a سَلِيل [q. v.]. (M,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He took the thing. (Msb.) Hence<br>\
one says, تُسَلُّ المَيِّتُ مِنْ قِبَلِ رَأْسِهِ إِلَى القَبْرِ, i. e.<br>\
[The dead body] is taken [head-foremost to the<br>\
grave]: (Msb:) [or is drawn forth &amp;c.: for] it<br>\
is said of the Apostle of God, سُلَّ مِنْ قِبَل رَأْسِهِ,<br>\
meaning He was drawn forth [&amp;c.] from the bier.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, aor. and inf. n. as above, He<br>\
stole the thing: (Msb, TA:) or he stole it covertly,<br>\
secretly, or clandestinely; (TA;) and so ↓ اسلّهُ.<br>\
(TK. [But see 4, below, where اسلّ meaning<br>\
“ he stole ” is mentioned only as intrans.]) You<br>\
say, سَلَّ البَعِيرَ جَوْفِ اللَّيْلِ He drew away the<br>\
camel from among the other camels in the middle<br>\
of the night: and in like manner you say of other<br>\
things. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  سَلَّ, aor.<br>\
سَلِ3َ, (K,) inf. n. سَلٌّ,<br>\
(TK,) said of a man; (TA;) or سَلَّتْ, aor.<br>\
سَلَ3َ,<br>\
[whence it would seem that the sec. pers. of the<br>\
pret. is سَلِلْتَ, and the inf. n. سَلَلٌ,] said of a<br>\
sheep or goat, شاة; (M;) He, or it, lost his, or<br>\
its, teeth: (M, K:) on the authority of Lh. (M.)<br>\
-A3-  سُلَّ, (M, Msb, K,) in the pass. form, (Msb,)<br>\
with damm, (K,) He was, or became, affected<br>\

4<br>\
أَسْلَ3َ see 1, second sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  اسلّ, (ISk, S, M,<br>\
Mgh,) inf. n. إِسْلَالٌ, (ISk, S, K,) also signifies<br>\
He stole: (ISk, S, Mgh:) or he stole covertly,<br>\
secretly, or clandestinely. (M, K.) See also 1, in<br>\
the latter half of the paragraph. You say, اسلّ<br>\
مِنَ المَغْنَمِ He stole of the spoil. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
إِسْلَالٌ signifies also An open raid or predatory<br>\
incursion. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And اسلّ He aided another<br>\
to steal, or to steal covertly, secretly, or clandestinely. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [See also إِسْلَالٌ below. Accord. to Freytag, اسلّ signifies He received a<br>\
bribe: but this requires consideration: he gives<br>\
no authority but the K, which does not justify<br>\
this explanation.]<br>\
-A2-  اسلّهُ He (God) caused him<br>\
to be affected with the disease termed سِلّ [q. v.].<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تسلّل: see 7: and see also 1, in the former<br>\
half of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q. اِضْطَرَبَ [It<br>\
was, or became, in a state of commotion, agitation, &amp;c.]; said of a thing; as though it were<br>\
imagined to be repeatedly drawn forth. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انسلّ It (a thing) became pulled out, or<br>\
drawn forth, gently; (M;) it became drawn, or<br>\
pulled out or forth, as a sword from its scabbard,<br>\
and a hair from dough. (Mgh.) You say, انسلّ<br>\
السَّيْفُ مِنَ الغَمْدِ The sword [became drawn from<br>\
the scabbard: or] slipped out from the scabbard.<br>\
(TA.) And انسلّ قِيَادُالفَرَسِ مِنْ يَدِهِ [The leading-rope of the horse slipped out or] came forth<br>\
[from his hand]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence], as<br>\
also ↓ تسلّل, (S, M, K,) He slipped away, or<br>\
stole away; i. e., went away covertly, secretly, or<br>\
clandestinely: (M, K:) or he went forth, مِنْ<br>\
بَيْنِهِمْ [from among them]. (S.) And اِنْسَلَلْتُ<br>\
مِنْ بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ I went away, and went forth, deliberately, or leisurely, and by degrees, from before<br>\
him. (TA.) Sb says that اِنْسَلَلْتُ [used in this<br>\
or a similar sense] is not a quasi-pass. verb; but<br>\
is only like [a verb of the measure] فَعَلْتُ; like<br>\
as اِفْتَقَرَ is like ضَعُفَ. (M.) It is said in a prov.,<br>\
رَمَتْنِى بِدَائِهَاوَانْسَلَّتْ [She reproached me with<br>\
her own fault, and slipped away]: (S, Meyd,<br>\
TA:) [originally] said by one of the fellow-wives<br>\
of Ruhm, daughter of El-Khazraj, wife of Saad<br>\
Ibn-Zeyd-Menáh, on Ruhm&#39;s reproaching her<br>\
with a fault that was in herself. (Meyd, TA.<br>\
[See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. cap. x. no. 2;<br>\
and another prov. there referred to in cap. ii.<br>\
no. 78.]) And one says also, بِكَذَا ↓ استلّ, meaning He went away with such a thing covertly,<br>\
secretly, or clandestinely. (TA.)<br>\

the reverse may be the case,] سَلْسَلْتُهُ I bound<br>\

And سَلْسَلْتُ المَآءَ فِى الحَلْقِ I poured the water<br>\

throat, or fauces: (S, O:) or it ran down a declivity, or declivous place: (M, K:) or (assumed tropical:)  it became<br>\
[fretted with a succession of ripples] like a chain,<br>\
in running [in a shallow and rugged bed], or<br>\
when smitten by the wind. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, said of<br>\
lightning, (assumed tropical:)  It assumed the form of سَلَاسِل, [i. e.<br>\

(M;) and to a she-camel whose teeth have fallen<br>\

having no tooth remaining; on the authority of<br>\
IAar. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also سَلَّةٌ, in two places.<br>\
سُلٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
سِلٌّ (S, M, Msb, K) and ↓ سُلَالٌ, (S, M, K,) the<br>\
former [the more common, and] often occurring<br>\
in the verses of chaste poets, though El-Hareeree<br>\
says in the “ Durrat el-Ghowwás ” that it is an<br>\
erroneous term of the vulgar, and that the latter<br>\
is the right term, (TA,) signify the same, (S, M,<br>\

ذَات الرِّئَة [i. e. inflammation of the lungs] or<br>\
ذَات الجَنْب [i. e. pleurisy]: (in the CK, بِعَقَبِ<br>\
ذات الرِّيّةِ اوذاتِ الجَنْبِ is [erroneously] put in<br>\
the place of تُعَقِّبُ ذَاتَ الرِّئَةِ أَوْ ذَاتَ الجَنْبِ: and<br>\
in what here follows, the gen. case is put in the<br>\
place of the nom. in four instances:) or a rheum<br>\
(زُكَامٌ), and defluxions (نَوَازِلُ), or a long cough,<br>\
and attended with constant fever. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence the saying, in a trad., غُبَارُذَيْلِ المَرْأَةِ<br>\
الفَاجِرَةِ يُورثُ السِّلَّ (assumed tropical:)  [The dust of the skirt of the<br>\
vitious woman occasions the loss of property];<br>\
meaning that he who follows vitious women and<br>\
acts vitiously, loses his property, and becomes<br>\
poor: the diminution and departure of property<br>\
being likened to the diminution and wasting away<br>\
of the body when one has the disorder termed<br>\
سِلّ. (TA.)<br>\
سَلَّةٌ The drawing of swords; (S, M, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ سِلَّةٌ. (K.) So in the saying, أَتَيْنَاهُمْ عِنْدَ السَّلَّةِ<br>\
[We came to them on the occasion of the drawing<br>\
of swords]. (S, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Theft: (S, Msb:)<br>\

one says, فِى بَنِى فُلَانٍ سَلَّةٌ [Among the sons of<br>\
such a one is theft, or covert theft]: (S:) and<br>\
الخَلَّةُ تَدْعُو إِلَى السَّلَّةِ [Want invites to theft, or<br>\
covert theft]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also (tropical:)  The rush (دُفْعَة)<br>\
of a horse among other horses, in running:<br>\
(TA:) or the rush (دُفْعَة) of a horse in striving<br>\

copy of the S; instead of فى سِيَاقِهِ, as in other<br>\
copies of the S and in the TA:]) so in the saying,<br>\
فَرَسٌ شَدِيدُ السَّلَّةِ (tropical:)  [A horse of which the rush &amp;c.<br>\
is vehement]: (S, TA:) and خَرَجَتْ سَلَّتُهُ عَلَى<br>\
الخَيْلِ (S) or عَلَى سَائِرِ الخَيْلِ (TA) (tropical:)  [His rush<br>\
in striving to outstrip proceeded against the other<br>\
horses]. ―<br>\
-b2-  And A revulsion of shortness of<br>\
breathing (اِرْتِدَادُ رَبْوٍ) in the chest of a horse, in<br>\
consequence of his suppressing such shortness of<br>\
breathing [so I render مِنْ كَبْوَةٍ يَكْبُوهَا, but this<br>\
phrase admits of other renderings, as will be seen<br>\
in art. كبو]: (M, K:) when he is inflated<br>\
thereby, one says, أَخْرَجَ سَلَّتَهُ [app. meaning he<br>\
has manifested his revulsion of shortness of breathing]; and thereupon he is urged to run with<br>\
vehemence, and made to sweat, and coverings<br>\
are thrown upon him, and that shortness of<br>\
breathing (ذٰلِكَ الرَّبْوُ) passes forth. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [In<br>\
a sheep or goat, or a ewe or she-goat, it seems to<br>\
mean Power, or force, of long continuance: see<br>\
مَسْلُولَةٌ, voce مَسْلُولٌ.]<br>\

(Msb:) [sometimes covered with red skin: (see<br>\
حَوَرٌ:) in the present day commonly applied to a<br>\
basket made of twigs, oblong and deep, generally<br>\
between a foot and a foot and a half in length:]<br>\
and ↓ سَلٌّ signifies the same: (M, K:) what is<br>\
termed سَلَّةُ الخُبْزِ [the bread-basket] is well<br>\
known: (S:) سَلَّةٌ meaning as expl. above is not<br>\
thought by IDrd to be an Arabic word: (M:)<br>\
[the dim. ↓ سُلَيْلَةٌ occurs in the K voce جُونَةٌ, and<br>\
in the Mgh voce رَبْعَةٌ, &amp;c.:] the pl. is سِلَالٌ (M,<br>\
K) and سَلَّاتٌ (Msb) and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ سَلٌّ, of<br>\
which Abu-l-Hasan says that it is in his opinion<br>\
a rare kind of pl. [or coll. gen. n.] because it<br>\
denotes what is made by art, not created, and it<br>\
should more properly be regarded as of the class<br>\
of كَوْكَبٌ and كَوْكَبَةٌ [which are syn.] because<br>\
this is more common than the class of سَفِينَةٌ and<br>\
سَفِينٌ. (M.)<br>\
-A5-  Also A fault, or defect, in a water-ing-trough or tank, or in a [jar of the kind called]<br>\

with ة a filly; (S, * M, TA;) the ة being affixed,<br>\
though سليل is of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense<br>\
of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, because the word is made<br>\
a subst.: (Ham p. 102:) or, as some say, (M, in<br>\
the K “ and ”) the former signifies a colt that is<br>\
born not in a [membrane such as is called] مَاسِكَة<br>\
nor [in one such as is called] سَلًى: if in either<br>\
of these, it is termed بَقِيرٌ [not بُقَيْرٌ as in the CK].<br>\
(M, K.) [See also دُعْمُوصٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And A young<br>\
camel when just born, before it is known whether<br>\
it is a male or a female. (As, S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Clear,<br>\
or pure, beverage or wine; (K, TA;) as though<br>\
gently drawn away from dust or motes or particles of rubbish or the like: such is said to be the<br>\
beverage, or wine, of Paradise: or cool beverage<br>\
or wine: or such as is clear from dust or motes<br>\
or particles of rubbish or the like, and from<br>\
turbidness; of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of<br>\
the measure مَفْعُولٌ: or such as is easy [in its<br>\
descent] in the throat, or fauces. (TA.) [See<br>\
also سُلَالَةٌ, and سَلْسَالٌ.]<br>\
-A3-  The channel of the<br>\

a place in which are trees: (TA:) or a narrow<br>\

of both سُلَّانٌ, (M, K,) or of the former accord.<br>\
to Kr, (M, TA,) and of the latter accord. to As<br>\
[and the S], (TA,) or that of the latter is سَوَالُّ.<br>\
(En-Nadr, K, TA.) One says سَلِيلٌ مِنْ سَمُرٍ<br>\
like as one says غَالٌّ مِنْ سَلَمٍ. (S.) The phrase<br>\
سَالَ السَّلِيلُ بِهِمْ [lit. The wide, or wide and deep,<br>\

It is said in the Kur [xxiii. 12], وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا<br>\
الْإِنْسَانَ مِنْ سُلَالَةٍ مِنْ طِينٍ, meaning [And<br>\
