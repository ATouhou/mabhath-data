so called because of the خُضْرَة [which means both<br>\
greenness and a colour approaching to blackness]<br>\

because it appears to be thus at a distance. (Msb.)<br>\
سُوَادٌ Secret speech with another; as also سِوَادٌ:<br>\
(M, K, TA:) each a subst. from سَاوَدَهُ, accord.<br>\
to A&#39;Obeyd: (M, TA:) but [ISd says,] in my<br>\
opinion the latter is the inf. n. of سَاوَدَ, [and as<br>\
such it has been mentioned above, (see 3,)] and<br>\
the former is the simple subst., the two words<br>\
being like مُزَاحٌ and مِزَاحٌ: (M:) As disallowed<br>\
the former, but it is authorized by AO and others.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain disease incident to sheep<br>\
or goats. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A certain disease incident<br>\
to man; (K;) a pain that attacks the liver, in<br>\

the complexion, and a greenness (خُضْرَة [app.<br>\
here meaning a blackish hue inclining to greenness]) in the nail, (K, TA,) incident to people<br>\

سَيِّدٌ, (S, M, K, &amp;c.,) of the measure فَعِيلٌ;<br>\
[originally سَوِيدٌ, for a reason to be mentioned<br>\
below; the kesreh upon the و, being deemed<br>\
difficult of pronunciation, is suppressed, and the<br>\
quiescent و and ى thus coming thgether, the<br>\
latter receives the rejected kesreh, and the و is<br>\
changed into ى and incorporated into the augmentative ى; as in the case of جَيِّدٌ with those<br>\
who hold it to be originally جَوِيدٌ;] or, accord. to<br>\
the Basrees, it is of the measure فَيْعِلٌ; [originally<br>\
سَيْوِدٌ;] (S;) and also ↓ سَيْدٌ; (Mz, 40th نوع,<br>\
section on the class of هَيِّنٌ and هَيْنٌ;) A chief,<br>\
lord, or master: (M, L, Mgh, Msb: [accord.<br>\
to the last of which, this is a secondary signification, as will be seen below:]) a prince, or king:<br>\
(Fr, L:) one who is set before, or over, others: a<br>\
master of a household: (L:) a woman&#39;s husband:<br>\
(Fr, M, Msb:) a possessor, an owner, or a proprietor: (L, Msb:) a slave&#39;s master, or owner:<br>\
(Fr, M, Msb:) a superior in rank or station or<br>\
condition; one possessing pre-eminence or excel-lence; a man of rank or quality; a personage;<br>\
a man of distinction: (L:) one who surpasses<br>\
others in intelligence and property, and in repelling injury, and in beneficence, or usefulness,<br>\
who makes a just use of his property, and aids<br>\
others by himself: (ISh, L:) one possessed of<br>\
glory, honour, dignity, eminence, exalted or elevated state, or nobility; (L, Msb; [accord. to<br>\
the latter of which, this is the primary signification;]) generous, noble, or high-born: (L:) the<br>\
most generous, noble, or high-born, of a people:<br>\
(Msb:) a liberal, bountiful, or munificent, person: (Fr, L:) clement; forbearing; one who<br>\
endures injurious treatment from his people:<br>\
(L:) devout, abstaining from unlawful things,<br>\
and clement, or forbearing: (Katádeh, L:) one<br>\
who is not overcome by his anger: (&#39;Ikrimeh, L:)<br>\
accord. to As, the Arabs say that it signifies any<br>\
one who is subdued, or repressed, by his principle<br>\
of clemency, or forbearance: (L:) and ↓ سَائِدٌ<br>\
signifies the same as سَيِّدٌ: or one inferior to a<br>\
سَيِّد: (K:) or, accord. to Fr, one says, هٰذَا سَيِّدُ<br>\
قَوْمِهِ اليَوْمَ [this is the lord, &amp;c., of his people today]; but if you announce that he will be their<br>\
سيّد after a little while, you say هُوَ سَائِدُ قَوْمِهِ عَنْ<br>\
قَلِيلٍ, and سَيِّدُ: (S:) the fem. of سَيِّدٌ [and of<br>\
↓ سَائِدٌ] is with ة: (M, L, Msb:) pl. of سَيِّدٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) or of ↓ سَائِدٌ, (M, K,) سَادَةٌ (S, M, Msb, K)<br>\
and سَيَائِدُ (S, K) and [pl. of سَادَةٌ] سَادَاتٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
[J says that] سَادَةٌ is of the measure فَعَلَةٌ, [orinally سَوَدَةٌ,] because سَيِّدٌ is of the measure<br>\
فَعِيلٌ; [as has been before mentioned;] and it is<br>\
like سَرَاةٌ as pl. of سَرِىٌّ, the only other instance<br>\
of the kind; this being shown to be the case by<br>\
the fact that سَيِّدٌ has also as a pl. سَيَائِدُ, with ء,<br>\
[and with the و changed into ى because it is so<br>\
changed in the sing.,] like as أَفِيلٌ has أَفَائِلُ, and<br>\
like as تَبِيعٌ has تَبَائِعُ; but the Basrees, who hold<br>\
سَيِّدٌ to be of the measure فَيْعِلٌ, say that it becomes<br>\
of the measure فَعَلَةٌ in the pl. as though it were<br>\
سَائِدٌ, like قَائِدٌ, which has قَادَةٌ as a pl., and like<br>\
ذَائِدٌ, which has ذَادَةٌ as a pl.; and they also say<br>\
that سَيَائِدُ, with ء, as pl. of سَيِّدٌ, is contr. to<br>\
analogy; for by rule it should be without ء. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [In the present day it is also particularly applied to signify, like شَرِيف, Any descendant of the<br>\
Prophet.] ―<br>\
-b3-  One of the poets has used it in<br>\
relation to the jinn, or genii; saying,<br>\
يَنْدُبْنَ سَيِّدَهُنَّةْ  جِنٌّ هَبَبْنَ بِلَيْلٍ<br>\
[Genii that were roused from their sleep by night,<br>\
summoning, or perhaps bewailing and eulogizing<br>\
their chief]: Akh says that this is a well-known<br>\
verse of the poetry of the Arabs: but it is asserted<br>\
by one, or more, likewise deserving of reliance,<br>\
that it is of the poetry of El-Weleed [and therefore<br>\
post-classical]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And the wild ass is<br>\
called (assumed tropical:)  the سَيِّد of his female. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also,<br>\
(Ks, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ↓ سِيَّدٌ, (K,) the<br>\
latter on the authority of Aboo-&#39;Alee, (TA,)<br>\
applied to a he-goat, (assumed tropical:)  Advanced in years: (Ks,<br>\
S, M; Mgh, Msb, K:) or in its third year:<br>\
(Mgh:) or great, though not advanced in years:<br>\
(TA:) or it is of general application, for it occurs<br>\
in a trad. applied to the camel and the ox-kind. (M,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And the former also signifies (assumed tropical:)  What is<br>\
most eminent, exalted, or noble, of any things:<br>\
and is applied by Zj to the Kur-án, because, he<br>\
says, it is سَيِّدُ الكَلَامِ (assumed tropical:)  [The paragon of speech].<br>\
(M.)<br>\
سِيَّدٌ: see the last sentence but one above.<br>\
سُوَيْدٌ the abbreviated dim. of أَسْوَدُ: (S, Mgh,<br>\

-b2-  Also [as a subst., or an<br>\
epithet in which the quality of a subst. predominates,] Water; (M, Mgh, L;) as also ↓ أَسْوَدُ:<br>\
(M: [but see الأَسْوَدَانِ, voce أَسْوَدُ:]) the former<br>\
is [said to be] used in this sense in negative<br>\
phrases only: (M, L:) one says, مَاسَقَاهُمْ مِنْ<br>\
سُوَيْدٍ قَطْرَةً He gave them not to drink a drop of<br>\
water. (M, Mgh, * L.) ―<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  see also سَوَادٌ, in two places: ―<br>\
-b3-  and سُوَيْدٌ: ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
and أَسْوَدُ, near the end of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b5-  Also<br>\
A certain bird. (M.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And Salt tracts (سِبَاخ)<br>\
of [plants of the kind called] نَجِيل: Kr explains<br>\
it by نِبْتَةٌ [app. a mistranscription for نَبْتَةٌ a<br>\
plant]; without describing it. (M.)<br>\
سَائِدٌ: see سَيِّدٌ, in the middle of the paragraph,<br>\
in three places.<br>\
أَسْوَدُ Greater, and greatest, in respect of estimation, rank, or dignity; syn. أَجَلُّ: (S, K:) and,<br>\
as some say, more [and most] liberal or bountiful<br>\
or munificent: or more [and most] clement or<br>\
forbearing. (TA.) One says, هُوَ أَسْوَدُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ<br>\
He is greater &amp;c. (أَجَلُّ) than such a one. (S.)<br>\
And الأَسْوَدُ مِنَ القَوْمِ means The greatest &amp;c.<br>\
(الأَجَلُّ) of the people, or party. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also Black; i. e. having سَوَاد, (M, * Mgh,)<br>\
which is the contr. of بَيَاض: (M, Mgh:) and<br>\
↓ أَسْوَدِىٌّ signifies the same as أَسْوَدُ: (Ham p.<br>\
379:) [or has an intensive signification, like<br>\
أَحْمَرىٌّ:] the fem. of أَسْوَدُ is سَوْدَآءُ: (Mgh, Msb:)<br>\
the dim. of أَسْوَدُ is ↓ أُسَيِّدُ, (S, Msb,) and it is<br>\
allowable to say ↓ أُسَيْوِدُ, [as is shown by an ex.<br>\
voce أَسَكُّ,] meaning [a little black thing; or<br>\
blackish, or] approaching to black; (S;) and the<br>\
abbreviated dim. is ↓ سُوَيْدٌ: (S, Mgh, Msb:) the<br>\
dim. of سَوْدَآءُ is ↓ سُوَيْدَآءُ: (Mgh:) the pl. of أَسْوَدُ<br>\
(M, Msb) and of سَوْدَآءُ (Msb) is سُودٌ (M, Msb)<br>\
and سُودَانٌ [which latter is especially applied to<br>\
human beings]. (M.) السُّودَانُ is said in the R<br>\
to denote [The negroes;] that particular people,<br>\
or race, who are the most stinking of mankind in<br>\
the armpits and sweat, and the more so those who<br>\
are eunuchs. (TA.) [It (i. e. السودان) is also<br>\
sometimes used for أَرْضُ السُّودَانِ, or بِلَادُ السُّودَانِ,<br>\
(The land, or the country, of the negroes,) or the<br>\
like: it is thus used in the TA voce سَمْغَرَةُ.] And<br>\
the epithet أَسْوَدُ is also applied by the Arabs to a<br>\
thing that is أَخْضَر [i. e. green]; because it<br>\
appears to be thus at a distance. (Msb. [See<br>\
أَخْضَرُ: and see حَدِيقَةٌ دَهْمَآءُ and مُدْهَامَّةٌ, voce<br>\
أَدْهَمُ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] أَسْوَدُ القَلْبِ and سَوْدَآؤُهُ: see<br>\
سَوَادٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  [And السَّوْدَآءُ The black bile; one of the<br>\
four humours of the body; of which the others<br>\
are the yellow bile (الصَّفْرَآءُ), the blood (الدَّمُ),<br>\
and the phlegm (البَلْغَمُ).] ―<br>\
-b4-  أَسْوَدُ as opposed to<br>\
أَحْمَرُ [and meaning The Arab race, and also,<br>\
accord. to some, in this case also, the black]: see<br>\
أَحْمَرُ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b5-  As applied to a certain<br>\
bird: see سُودَانِيَّةٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b6-  Also, as a<br>\
subst., (S,) or an epithet in which the quality of a<br>\
subst. predominates, (Sh, M,) so that it is used as<br>\
a subst., (Sh, TA,) but imperfectly decl., (TA,)<br>\
(tropical:)  A great serpent, (S, M, K,) in which is blackness: (S, M:) the worst and greatest and most<br>\
noxious of serpents, than which there is none more<br>\
daring, for sometimes it opposes itself to a company of travellers, and follows the voice, and it<br>\
is that which seeks retaliation, and he who is<br>\
bitten by it will not escape death: (Sh, TA:) it<br>\
is pluralized as a subst., (Sh, S, M,) its pl. being<br>\
أَسَاوِدُ (S, M) and أَسَاوِيدُ and ↓ أَسْوَدَاتٌ: (M:)<br>\
were it an epithet [used as such], its pl. would be<br>\
سُودٌ: it is also called أَسْوَدُ سَالِحٌ, because it casts<br>\
off its slough every year: you do not say أَسْوَدُ<br>\
سَالِخٍ: (S:) the female is called ↓ أَسْوَدَةٌ, (S, M,)<br>\
which is extr.; (M;) and to this the epithet<br>\
سَالِخَةٌ is not applied. (S.) ―<br>\
-b7-  الأَسْوَدَانِ means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The serpent and the scorpion; (Sh, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K;) which are to be killed during prayer: (Sh,<br>\
Mgh, Msb:) so called by the attribution of predominance [to the former]. (Sh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And<br>\
(tropical:)  Dates and water; (El-Ahmar, As, S, M, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) both together being thus called<br>\
by a term which properly applies to one only,<br>\
[accord. to some,] for [they say that] الأَسْوَدُ alone<br>\
signifies dates, not water, and especially, or<br>\
mostly, the dates of El-Medeeneh; and in like<br>\
manner, Aboo-Bekr and &#39;Omar together are<br>\
called العُمَرَانِ; and the sun and the moon<br>\
together, القَمَرَانِ: (TA:) or, as some say, it<br>\
means water and milk; and is applied by a rájiz<br>\
to water and the herb called الفَثّ, of [the grain<br>\
of] which bread is made, and is eaten [in time of<br>\
dearth or drought]. (M, L.) See also سُوَيْدٌ. ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
Also (assumed tropical:)  The حَرَّة [or tract strewn with black and<br>\
crumbling stones] and night: (S, M, L:) so called<br>\
because of their blackness. (M, L.) A party came<br>\
as guests to Muzebbid El-Medenee, and he said<br>\
to them, “There is nothing for you with us but<br>\
the أَسْوَدَانِ: ” and they replied, “Verily therein<br>\
is a sufficiency: dates and water: ” but he said,<br>\
“ I meant not that: I only meant the حَرَّة and<br>\
the night. ” (S, M.) And as to the saying of<br>\
&#39;Áïsheh, that she was with the Prophet when<br>\
they had no food, but only the أَسْوَدَانِ, which is<br>\
expl. by the lexicologists as meaning dates and<br>\
water, [and thus by Mtr in the Mgh, ISd says,]<br>\
in my opinion she only meant the حَرَّة and night.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b10-  هُوَ أَسْوَدُ الكَبِدِ [lit. He is black-livered]<br>\
means (tropical:)  he is an enemy: (A, TA:) and سُودُ الأَكْبَادِ<br>\
means (tropical:)  enemies. (M, A.) ―<br>\
-b11-  You say also,<br>\
جَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِغَنَمِهِ سُودَ البُطُونِ, and, in like manner,<br>\
حُمْرَ الكُلَى, both meaning (tropical:)  Such a one brought<br>\
his sheep, or goats, in a lean, or an emaciated,<br>\
state. (As, S, and A in art. حمر.) ―<br>\
-b12-  And<br>\
رَمَى بِسَهْمِهِ الأَسْوَدِ (tropical:)  He shot with his lucky<br>\
arrow, (A, K,) that was smeared with blood,<br>\
(A,) by means of which he looked for good<br>\
fortune, (K, TA,) because he had shot with it<br>\
and hit the object shot at, (TA,) or as though it<br>\
were black (K, TA) with blood, (TA,) or by its<br>\
having been much handled. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b13-  And<br>\
كَلَّمْتُهُ فَمَا رَدَّ عَلَىَّ سَوْدَآءَ وَلَا بَيْضَآءَ (tropical:)  I spoke to<br>\
him, and he did not return to me a bad word nor<br>\
a good one: (S, L:) or a single word. (A.) ―<br>\
-b14-<br>\
وَطْأَةٌ سَوْدَآءُ means (assumed tropical:)  A footstep, or footprint,<br>\
that is becoming effaced: a recent one is termed<br>\
حَمْرَآءُ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b15-  السَّوْدَآءُ (assumed tropical:)  Cultivated, or planted,<br>\
land; opposed to البَيْضَآءُ [q. v.]. (TA in art. بيض<br>\
[See also سَوْدَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b16-  [But سَنَةٌ سَوْدَآءُ means (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
very severe year; more severe than such as is<br>\
termed حَمْرَآءُ; which is more severe than the<br>\
بَيْضآء, and still more so than the شَهْبَآء: see<br>\
arts. شهب and حمر.] ―<br>\
-b17-  الحَبَّةُ السَّوْدَآءُ, said in a<br>\
trad. to be a remedy for every disease except<br>\
death, (TA,) i. q. الشُّونِيزُ [q. v.], (K,) as also<br>\
↓ السُّوَيْدَآءُ, (TA,) [i. e.] this latter signifies حَبَّةُ<br>\
الشُّونِيزِ, (M,) or properly الشِّينِيز, for thus the<br>\
Arabs called it accord. to IAar: or, as some say,<br>\
i. q. الحَبَّةُ الخَضْرَآءُ [q. v. in art. حب], because the<br>\
Arabs [often] call black أَخْضَر, and green أَسْوَد.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  It is also used as an epithet denoting<br>\
excess; but as such is anomalous, being formed<br>\
from a verb whence the simple epithet is of the<br>\
measure أَفْعَلُ: so in the saying, أَسْوَدُ مِنْ حَلَكِ<br>\
الغُرَابِ [Blacker than the blackness, or intense<br>\
blackness, of the crow, or raven: see حَلَكٌ].<br>\
