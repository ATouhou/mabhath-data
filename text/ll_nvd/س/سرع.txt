سَرُعَ, aor.<br>\
سَرُعَ, inf. n. سِرَعٌ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
سَرَعٌ (TA [and mentioned in the K, but app. as a<br>\
simple subst.,]) and سِرْعٌ and سَرْعٌ and سَرَاعَةٌ (TA)<br>\
and سُرْعَةٌ, (K,) or this last is a simple subst.<br>\
from أَسْرَعَ, (Msb,) [but it is also generally used<br>\
as syn. with the inf. ns. before mentioned when<br>\
they are employed as simple substs., and is more<br>\
common than any of them,] He, or it, was quick,<br>\
expeditious, hasty, speedy, rapid, swift, or fleet:<br>\
[in course, tendency, action, speech, &amp;c.:] (S,<br>\
K:) or, said of a man, i. q. أَسْرَعَ [which may<br>\
mean as above, or he hastened, made haste, or<br>\
sped,] in his speech and in his actions: (IAar,<br>\
TA:) but Sb makes a difference between سَرُعَ<br>\
and أَسْرَعَ: see the latter below: (TA:) one says<br>\
also سَرِعَ, aor.<br>\
سَرَعَ; a dial. var. of سَرُعَ: and ↓ تسرّع,<br>\
said of an affair, or event, signifies the same as<br>\
سَرُعَ. (TA.) One says, السِّرَعَ السِّرَعَ like الوَحَآءَ<br>\
الوَحَآءَ, (S, K,) i. e. [Make thou] haste; or haste<br>\
to be first, or before, or beforehand: haste; or<br>\
haste to be first, &amp;c. (S and TA in art. وحى.)<br>\
And سَرُعَ مَا فَعَلْتَ ذَاكَ, (S, * TA,) and سَرْعَ,<br>\
which is a contraction of the former; for the<br>\
Arabs contract by the suppression of dammeh<br>\
and kesreh because they are difficult of pronunciation, saying فَخْذٌ for فَخِذٌ and عَضْدٌ for عَضْدٌ,<br>\
but one should not say حَجْرٌ for حَجَرٌ, (S, TA,)<br>\
or the like, accord. to the Basrees, though the<br>\
Koofees allow the contraction in the case of<br>\
fet-hah also, as in سَلْفَ for سَلَفَ; (M in art.<br>\
سلف;) and one says also سُرْعَ, as a contraction<br>\
of سَرُعَ; all meaning سَرْعَانَ [i. e. Quick was thy<br>\
doing that: or how quick was thy doing that!<br>\
or, which is nearly the same, excellently quick<br>\
was thy doing that; for سَرُعَ is similar to قَضُوَ and<br>\
رَمُوَ, denoting excellence]. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
سَرَّعَ see 4.<br>\
3<br>\
مُسَارَعَةٌ signifies The hastening with another;<br>\
or vying, or striving, with another, in hastening;<br>\
or hastening to be, or get, before another or<br>\
others; (S, K;) إِلَى شَىْءٍ to a thing; (S;) as<br>\
also ↓ تَسَارُعٌ; syn. مُبَادَرَةٌ; (S, K;) with which,<br>\
also, [not, however, as it is expl. above, but in<br>\
the sense of بُدُورٌ, i. e. simply the hastening to a<br>\
thing,] ↓ إِسْرَاعٌ is syn. (TA.) One says, سَارَعُوا<br>\
إِلَى كَذَا and إِلَيْهِ ↓ تسارعوا, [They hastened, one<br>\
with another, &amp;c., to such a thing,] both signifying the same. (S.) And [of a single person,]<br>\
سارع إِلَى الشَّىْءِ He hastened to the thing; syn.<br>\
بادر. (Msb.) And it is said in the Kur [iii. 127],<br>\
وَسَارِعُوا إِلَى مَغْفِرَةٍ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ [And vie ye, one with<br>\
another, in hastening to obtain forgiveness from<br>\
your Lord]. (TA.) And again, [iii. 170,]<br>\
الَّذِينَ يُسَارِعُونَ فِى الكُفْرِ Who fall into unbelief<br>\
hastily, or quickly, (Bd, Jel,) and eagerly. (Bd.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسرع is originally trans.; (S, K;) [signifying<br>\
He quickened, or hastened, himself, or his going,<br>\
&amp;c.;] and hence the saying, in a trad., إِذَا مَرَّ<br>\
أَحَدُكُمْ بِطِرْبَالٍ مَائِلٍ فَلْيُسْرِعِ المَشْىَ [When any<br>\
one of you passes by a high wall, or the like, that<br>\
is inclining, let him quicken, or hasten, the pace,<br>\
or going]. (K, * TA.) But [it is used also elliptically, as meaning He hastened, in an intrans.<br>\
sense; he made haste; he sped; he went quickly;<br>\
and hence] you say, اسرع فِى السَّيْرِ, (S, K,) like<br>\
سَرُعَ [He was quick, expeditious, hasty, speedy,<br>\
rapid, swift, or fleet, in going, journeying, or<br>\
pace]: (K:) or [rather he hastened, made haste,<br>\
or sped, therein; for] اسرع signifies he endeavoured, or sought, and affected, to be quick, &amp;c.,<br>\
as though he hastened the pace, or going; but<br>\
↓ سَرُعَ denotes what is as it were an innate quality:<br>\
(Sb:) the verb being originally trans., when you<br>\
say of one اسرع فى السير it is as though [meaning]<br>\
he urged himself forward with haste; or he quickened, or hastened, the pace, or going; and it is<br>\
only because the meaning is understood by the<br>\
persons addressing one another, that the objective<br>\
complement is not expressed: (Lth, K:) or the<br>\
verb may be trans. by means of a particle and<br>\
without a particle: or when made immediately<br>\
trans., the phrase may be meant to be understood<br>\
as elliptical. (TA.) [Accord. to Fei,] اسرع فِى<br>\
مَشْيِهِ, &amp;c., inf. n. إِسْرَاعٌ, is originally اسرع مَشْيَهُ<br>\
[He quickened, or hastened, his pace, or going];<br>\
فى being redundant; or اسرع الحَرَكَةَ فِى مَشْيِهِ<br>\
[he quickened, or hastened, the motion in his<br>\
going]: and اسرع إِلَيْهِ means اسرع المُضِىَّ إِلَيْهِ [he<br>\
quickened, or hastened, the going to him]. (Msb.)<br>\
↓ سرّع is syn. with اسرع. (TA.) And you say,<br>\
إِلَى الشَّرِّ ↓ تسرّع, (S, K,) meaning He hastened,<br>\
or made haste, to [do] evil, or mischief; (K;) as<br>\
also تزرّع. (Sgh and K in art. زرع.) And ↓ تسرّع<br>\
بِالأَمْرِ He hastened to do the thing, or affair;<br>\
syn. بَادَرَ بِهِ. (TA.) See also 3. ―<br>\
-b2-  اسرع إِلَيْهِ<br>\
occurs in a trad. as meaning He was quick, or<br>\
hasty, in being angry with him, or in blaming<br>\
him, or in reviling him. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اسرع بِهِ: see<br>\
[its contr.] بَطَّأَ بِهِ. ―<br>\
-b4-  أَسْرَعُوا signifies also, Their<br>\
beasts on which they rode were, or became, quick,<br>\
swift, or fleet. (AZ, S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  مَا أَسْرَعَ مَا صَنَعْتَ<br>\
كَذَا [How quick was thy doing that!]. (S, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَسَرَّعَ see 1 and 4; the latter in two places.<br>\
6<br>\
تَسَاْرَعَ see 3, in two places.<br>\
سَرْعٌ [originally an inf. n. of سَرُعَ, like سِرْعٌ and<br>\
سَرَعٌ accord. to the TA]: see سَرِيعٌ, in two places.<br>\
سَرَعٌ: see [1 and] سُرْعَةٌ.<br>\
سَرِعٌ: see سَرِيعٌ.<br>\
سُرْعَةٌ Quickness, expedition, haste, speed, rapidity, swiftness, or fleetness; [of course, tendency, action, speech, &amp;c.;] (S, K;) as also<br>\
↓ سَرَعٌ; (K;) [the former said in the K, and the<br>\
latter in the TA, to be an inf. n. of سَرُعَ:] and a<br>\
hastening, making haste, or speeding; i. q. إِسْرَاعٌ<br>\
[inf. n. of 4]; (TA;) or a subst. therefrom.<br>\
(Msb.) You say, عَجِبْتُ مِنْ سُرْعَةِ ذَاكَ [I wondered at the quickness, &amp;c., of that]. (S.)<br>\
سَرْعَانَ and سُرْعَانَ and سِرْعَانَ (S, K) and ↓ سَرُعَانَ,<br>\
the last with damm to the ر (IAar,) occurring in<br>\
the phrase سرعانَ ذَا خُرُوجًا, (IAar, S, K,) meaning سَرُعَ ذَا خُرُوجًا [Quick is this in coming forth:<br>\
or how quick is this in coming forth! or, which is<br>\
nearly the same, excellently quick &amp;c.], (S, K,)<br>\
are dial. vars., changed from the original form,<br>\
which is سَرُعَ, and, for this reason, (S,) made<br>\
indecl., with the final vowel of سَرُعَ for their<br>\
termination. (S, K.) The word سرعان is used as<br>\
a simple enunciative [placed before its inchoative],<br>\
and also as an enunciative denoting wonder: [see<br>\
بُطْآنَ:] and hence the saying, (K,) لَسَرْعَانَ مَا<br>\
صَنَعْتَ كَذَا How quick was thy doing that! (S, K.)<br>\
The saying سَرَعَانَ ذَا إِهَالَةٌ originated from the fact<br>\
that a man had a lean ewe, her snivel running<br>\
from her nostrils by reason of her leanness, and<br>\
it being said to him “ What is this? ” he answered, “Her grease: ” whereupon the asker said<br>\
as above: the last word is in the accus. case as a<br>\
denotative of state; and the meaning is, Quick,<br>\
or how quick, is this snivel [coming forth] in the<br>\
state of melted grease! or the last word is a<br>\
specificative, under the supposition that the<br>\
action is transferred [from its proper agent,<br>\
which thus becomes a specificative], as in the<br>\
phrase تَصَبَّبَ زَيْدٌ عَرَقًا; and the meaning to be<br>\
understood is, Quick, or how quick, is the melted<br>\
grease of this! the saying is applied to him who<br>\
tells of a thing&#39;s coming to pass before its time:<br>\
(O, K:) it is a prov. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  سَرْعَانُ; and its<br>\
fem., سَرْعَى: see سَرِيعٌ, in two places: see also<br>\
the paragraph here next following, in two places,<br>\
سَرَعَانُ النَّاسِ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) and ↓ سَرْعَانُ<br>\
الناس, (IAar, K,) The first, or foremost, of the<br>\
men, or people, (IAar, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) striving,<br>\
one with another, to be the first to do a thing;<br>\
(K;) so says As, with reference to soldiers<br>\
hastening: (TA:) the former word in this phrase<br>\
is [distinguished from سَرْعَانَ in being] declinable<br>\
in every case: (S:) in two trads. in which the<br>\
phrase occurs, we find it differently related,<br>\
سَرَعَان and سُرْعَان; the latter being pl. of سَرِيعٌ.<br>\
(TA.) سَرَعَانُ الخَيْلِ, also, signifies The first or<br>\
foremost, of the horsemen, and sometimes they<br>\
said الخيل ↓ سَرْعَانُ. (K.) Abu-l-&#39;Abbás says<br>\
that when سرعان is an epithet applied to men, it<br>\
has both of the above-mentioned forms; but when<br>\
applied to others, the former is the more chaste,<br>\
though the latter is allowable. (TA.)<br>\
سَرُعَانَ: see سَرْعَانَ.<br>\
سُرَاعٌ; and its fem., with ة: see what next<br>\
follows, in three places.<br>\
سَرِيعٌ Quick, expeditious, hasty, speedy, rapid,<br>\
swift, or fleet; [in course, tendency, action,<br>\
speech, &amp;c.;] (S, Msb, * TA;) as also ↓ سَرِعٌ [and<br>\
↓ سَرْعٌ] and ↓ سُرَاعٌ, of which the fem. is with ة,<br>\
and ↓ سَرْعَانُ, of which the fem. is سَرْعَى; (TA;)<br>\
i. q. ↓ مُسْرِعٌ, (K,) which signifies as above;<br>\
(TA;) [and which also signifies hastening, making<br>\
haste, or speeding;] and ↓ مِسْرَعٌ, also, signifies<br>\
quick, &amp;c., (سَرِيع,) to [do] good or evil: (K:)<br>\
the pl. of سريع is سُرْعَانٌ, (K,) and سِرَاعٌ is [also<br>\
a pl. of the same,] syn. with مُسْرِعُونَ. (Msb.)<br>\
You say, فَرَسٌ سَرِيعٌ and ↓ سُرَاعٌ [A quick, swift,<br>\
or fleet, horse]: (IB:) and ↓ حِجْرٌ سُرَاعَةٌ meaning<br>\
سَرِيعَةٌ [a quick, swift, or fleet, mare]. (K.) And<br>\
↓ اِسْعَ عَلَى رِجْلِكَ السَّرْعَى [Go thou quickly; lit.<br>\
go thou, or walk thou, or run thou, upon thy<br>\
quick, or swift, leg]. (Fr.) And ↓ جَآءَ سَرْعًا meaning سَرِيعًا [He, or it, came quickly, hastily,<br>\
speedily, &amp;c.]. (TA.) And God is said [in the<br>\
Kur ii. 198, &amp;c.] to be سَرِيعُ الحِسَابِ [Quick in<br>\
reckoning], meaning that his reckoning will<br>\
inevitably come to pass; or that one reckoning<br>\
will not divert Him from another reckoning, nor<br>\
one thing from another thing; or that his actions<br>\
are quick, none of them being later than He<br>\
desireth, because it is done without manual operation and without effort, so that He will reckon<br>\
with mankind, after raising them from death and<br>\
congregating them, in the twinkling of an eye,<br>\
without numbering, or calculating: (K:) and [in<br>\
like manner He is said in the same, chap. vi.,<br>\
last verse, to be] سَرِيعُ العِقَابِ [quick in punishing]. (El-Mufradát, B.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A certain kind<br>\
of going, or pace; coupled with سُنْبُكٌ, which<br>\
signifies another kind thereof. (Ibn-Habeeb,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [السَّرِيعُ The ninth metre (بَحْر) in prosody, in which each hemistich originally consisted<br>\
of مُسْتَفْعِلُنْ مُسْتَفْعِلُنْ مَفْعُولَاتُ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And أَبُو سَرِيعٍ<br>\
The [shrub called] عَرْفَج: or the fire that is<br>\
therein. (K. [See زَحْفَةٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  Also A shoot, or<br>\
twig, that falls from the بَشَام [or tree of the<br>\
balsam of Mekkeh]: pl. سِرْعَانٌ and سُرْعَانٌ. (K.)<br>\
أَسْرَعُ [More, and most, quick, expeditious,<br>\
hasty, speedy, rapid, swift, or fleet, of course,<br>\
tendency, action, speech, &amp;c.]. [It is said, of<br>\
God, in the Kur vi. 62,] وَهُوَ أَسْرَعُ الحَاسِبِينَ<br>\
[And He is the quickest of the reckoners]. (K.)<br>\
[The fem.] سُرْعَى is applied to a she-camel by<br>\
Honeyf El-Hanátim [as meaning Surpassingly<br>\
quick or fleet]. (IAar, TA in art. بهى.)<br>\
مُسْرِعٌ: see سَرِيعٌ.<br>\
مِسْرَعٌ: see سَرِيعٌ.<br>\
مِسْرَاعٌ Very quick, or hasty, (K, TA,) to [do]<br>\
good or evil, (K,) or in affairs. (TA.)<br>\
