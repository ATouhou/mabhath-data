فِى أَمْرٍ in an affair.] ―<br>\

A careless mode of expression occasioning] a<br>\

thine acknowledgment of the everlasting existence<br>\
of God, (or, as it sometimes means, I ask God<br>\
to prolong thy life,) tell me, how can they meet<br>\
together? She is of the northern region when she<br>\
rises, and Suheyl, when he rises, is of the southern<br>\
region]. (Har p. 276. [But I have substituted<br>\
اللّٰهَ for اللّٰهُ, and يَمَانِى for يَمَانٍ. See also the<br>\

Sacy&#39;s Anthol. Gramm. Arabe, p. 139.]) [Freytag states that قَدَمَا سُهَيْلٍ is the name of Two<br>\
stars which are behind Canopus; on the authority of Meyd: and also mentions the name of<br>\
سهيل الشام, and سهيل الفرد, as given to Certain<br>\
stars in the constellation Anguis; adding that<br>\
Canopus is distinguished from سهيل الشام by the<br>\
name of سهيل اليمن.] The name of أُخْتَاسُهَيْلٍ<br>\
[The two sisters of Canopus] is applied to الشِّعْرَى<br>\
العَبُورُ [or Sirius] and الشِّعْرَى الغُمَيْصَآءُ [or Procyon], together. (S and K in art. شعر.) [See also<br>\
