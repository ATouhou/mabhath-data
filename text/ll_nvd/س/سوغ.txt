those who were born with the man in one case of<br>\
childbirth, after him, no other childbirth having<br>\

var. thereof: but IF says that هٰذَا سَوْغُ هٰذَا<br>\
means This is of the cast, mould, form, or fashion,<br>\
of this; and that the س may be a substitute for<br>\
ص; as though the one were cast, moulded, formed,<br>\

manner] one says, هٰذَا سَيْغُ هٰذَا this is proportionate to this, or of the proportion of this. (TA<br>\

and Bd and Jel in xvi. 68 and Bd in xxxv. 13;)<br>\
[or easy and agreeable to swallow;] not choking;<br>\
(Jel in xvi. 68;) and ↓ أَسْوَغُ signifies the same;<br>\
(IDrd, K, TA;) and so ↓ سَيِّغٌ, applied to food<br>\
[&amp;c.]; (TA;) [and ↓ مُسْتَسَاغٌ, accord. to Freytag,<br>\
as from the K, in which I do not find it.]<br>\
سَيِّغٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
أَسْوَغُ: see سَائِغٌ. [Freytag assigns to it also<br>\
another signification, which belongs not to it, but<br>\
to سَوْغ.]<br>\

(O, K,) from سَوَّغْتُهُ لَهُ, inf. n. تَسْوِيغٌ, meaning<br>\

And hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A place of entrance into a land<br>\
[&amp;c.]; as in a saying cited in the first paragraph<br>\

-b3-  And [hence] one says,<br>\
هٰذَا لَا أَجِدُ لَهُ مَسَاغًا (tropical:)  This, I do not find to it a<br>\
passage, or an [easy] entrance; or a way, or<br>\
place, of entrance. (TA.)<br>\
