humble, or submissive; or affected to be like<br>\
the مَسَاكِين [or destitute, or needy, &amp;c.]; syn.<br>\
قَنَعَ; (K, TA; [omitted in the CK, and in my<br>\
MS. copy of the K erroneously written قَنِعَ;])<br>\
and تَمَسْكَنَ. (TA.)<br>\
سُبْرُتٌ: see سُبْرُوتٌ.<br>\
سِبْرَاتٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
سُبْرُوتٌ A desert, syn. قَفْرٌ, (S, K,) or a plain,<br>\
syn. قَاعٌ, (M,) in which is no herbage: (M, K:)<br>\
or weak land: (TA:) and أَرْضٌ سُبْرُوتٌ and<br>\
↓ سِبْرِيتٌ (As, Lh, M) and ↓ سِبْرَاتٌ (M) Land in<br>\
which is no herbage; (M;) or land in which is<br>\
nothing: (As, Lh, M:) pl. سَبَارِيتُ and سَبَارٍ, the<br>\
latter anomalous, mentioned by Lh: (M:)<br>\
accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, the pl. سَبَارِيتُ signifies<br>\
deserts, or waterless deserts, (فَلَوَاتٌ,) in which is<br>\
nothing: and accord. to As, land [or lands] in<br>\
which nothing grows: (TA:) and one says also<br>\
أَرْضٌ سَبَارِيتُ, (M, K,) a phrase of the same class<br>\
as ثَوْبٌ أَخْلَاقٌ, (K,) as though the sing. سُبْرُوتٌ<br>\
or سِبْرِيتٌ were applied to every portion thereof.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) applied to a man, (AZ,<br>\
S, TA,) Needy, in want, indigent, (AZ, As, S,<br>\
M, K, TA,) poor, (AZ, As, K, TA,) possessing<br>\
little, (M, TA,) or, as some say, possessing<br>\
nothing; (S, * M, TA;) and ↓ سِبْرِيتٌ signifies<br>\
the same, (AZ, S, M, K,) as also ↓ سِبْرَاتٌ, and<br>\
↓ سُبْرُتٌ: (M, K:) also bankrupt, or insolvent;<br>\
syn. مُفْلِسٌ: (TA in explanation of the first [but<br>\
equally applying to all]:) the epithet applied to a<br>\
woman is سُبْرُوتَةٌ and ↓ سِبْرِيتَةٌ; (AZ, S;) the<br>\
latter of which is applied to a man [app. in<br>\
intensive sense, agreeably with analogy,] as well<br>\
as to a woman: (M:) and the pl. is سَبَارِيتُ,<br>\
applied to men and to women. (AZ, S.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence, also,] applied to a youth, or young man,<br>\
Beardless; or having no hair upon the sides of<br>\
his face. (M, K, TA. [In the K, this signification is immediately followed by the mention of<br>\
the pls. سَبَارِيتُ and سَبَارٍ.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And Little, or<br>\
small, in quantity or number; (S, M, K;) paltry,<br>\

-b5-<br>\
Also Tall, or long. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And A skilful,<br>\
or an expert, guide, well acquainted with the<br>\
lands. (TA.) It is mentioned by Sb, who says<br>\
that it is of measure فُعْلُولٌ, like زُنْبُورٌ and<br>\
عُصْفُورٌ; and most hold him to be right: but some<br>\
of the authors on inflection assert that it is of the<br>\
measure فُعْلُوتٌ, from سَبَرْتُ الشَّىْءَ meaning “ I<br>\
tried, proved, or tested, the thing, or proved it by<br>\
experiment or experience; ” and that the ت is<br>\
added to give intensiveness to the signification;<br>\
which several deny: (MF, TA:) سُبْرُورٌ, however,<br>\
is mentioned in the K, in art. سبر, as meaning<br>\
“ poor,” and land “ in which is no herbage. ”<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
سِبْرِيتٌ and سِبْرِيتَةٌ: see the next preceding<br>\
paragraph, in three places.<br>\
سَنْبَرِيتٌ A man (TA) of evil disposition or<br>\
nature. (K, TA: but omitted in the CK.)<br>\
مُسَبْرَتٌ Bald, or bare of hair. (K, TA: but<br>\
