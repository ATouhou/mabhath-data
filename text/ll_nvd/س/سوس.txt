the K, I find قُمل: in another of the S and<br>\
another of the K, and in the CK, and in a copy<br>\
of the M, قَمْل: the right reading apears to be<br>\
قُمَّل; for this last word is said by some to be<br>\
syn. with سُوس.]) You also say, when you are<br>\
gradually perishing by reason of grief, (إِذَا تَهَالَكْتَ<br>\
غَمًّا,) عَظْمِى وَدَوَّدَ لَحْمِى ↓ سَوَّسَ (tropical:)  [My bone has<br>\

of El-Hotei-ah, he uses the expression سَوَّسْتَ<br>\
أمْرَ بَنِيكَ [as though meaning Thou hast ruled<br>\
the affairs of thy sons]; but Fr says that سَوَّسْتَ<br>\
is a mistake. (S. [Thus I find it in one copy<br>\
of the S: but in another copy of the S, I find<br>\
سَوَّسْتِ, which is clearly wrong; and in the<br>\
TA, سُوِّسْتَ, which Fr can hardly be supposed<br>\
to have disallowed.]) ―<br>\

Msb:) and any eater of a thing is termed سُوسُهُ,<br>\
whether worm or other thing. (M.) One says,<br>\
العِيَالُ سُوسُ المَالِ (assumed tropical:)  [The persons who compose a<br>\
household are the grubs of property]: i. e., they<br>\
consume it by little and little like as سُوس consume grain, which can scarcely be cleared of them<br>\
when they attack it. (Msb.)<br>\

that of the مرخ, (M, TA,) without thorns and<br>\
without leaves, growing high; and persons shade<br>\
themselves beneath it; one of the Arabs said that<br>\
it is the same that is called ↓ سَوَاسٍ (written with<br>\
the article السَّوَاسِى); and AHn says, I asked him<br>\
respecting it, and he said that this and the مَرْخ and<br>\
the مَنْح all three resemble one another; (M;) and it<br>\
is one of the best of materials used for producing<br>\
fire, (Lth, * M, K, *) not giving a sound without<br>\
emitting fire, (M,) or because it seldom gives a<br>\
sound without emitting fire. (Lth, TA.)<br>\

A kind of stone upon which is generated the salt<br>\
