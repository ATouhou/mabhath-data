سَنَجَ He smeared anything with a colour<br>\
different from its own colour. (O, K.)<br>\
سُنُجٌ The عُنَّاب [or jujube]. (IAar, K.)<br>\
سَنْجَةٌ, as also صَنْجَةٌ, but the former is the<br>\
more chaste, (T, O, Msb, K,) accord to Fr, (O,)<br>\
because ص and ج do not both occur in any<br>\
[genuine] Arabic word, (Msb,) or the former<br>\
only is allowable accord. to Fr, (T, Msb,) or,<br>\
accord. to ISk, (T, O, Msb, and S in art. صنج,)<br>\
and IKt, (T, Msb,) the latter only is allowable;<br>\
(T, O, Msb, and S and O in art. صنج;) an arabicized word, (O, Msb, and S and A and K in art.<br>\
صنج,) from [the Pers.] سنك [or سَنْگْ, as meaning “ a weight ”]; (O;) [or rather from the<br>\
Pers. سَنْجَهْ meaning “ a balance ” and “ a<br>\
weight; ”] i. q. مِيزَانٌ [A balance]: (A in art.<br>\
صنج:) [in the present day, applied to a steel-yard: and also, more commonly, (agreeably with<br>\
the explanation of صَنْجَةٌ in the MA,) to a weight<br>\
of a balance; which last seems to be intended in<br>\
the S and O and Msb and K &amp;c. by the expressions سَنْجَةُ المِيزَانِ and صَنْجَتُهُ, unless these<br>\
expressions be instances of what is termed إِضَافَةُ<br>\
الشَّىْءِ إِلَى نَفْسِهِ (i. e. the prefixing a noun, governing the gen. case, to another noun signifying the<br>\
same thing), which I think unlikely:] pl. سِنَجٌ<br>\
(A, Msb) and سَنَجَاتٌ. (Msb.) One says, اِتَّزَنَ<br>\
منّى بِالسَّنْجَة الرَّاجِحَةِ [He received by weight<br>\
from me with the inclining balance, or with the<br>\
preponderating weight], and بِالسِّنَجِ الوَافِيَةِ [with<br>\
the full weights]. (A.) And a rájiz says,<br>\
كَأَنَّهَا سَنْجَةُ أَلْفٍ رَاجِحَهْ<br>\
[As though it, or she, were the weight of a thousand, preponderating]: or, as some relate it,<br>\
صَنْجَةٌ. (O.)<br>\
سُنْجَةٌ i. q. رُقْطَةٌ [i. e. Blackness mixed with<br>\
speckles of white: or the reverse: or speckles of<br>\
white, and of black, and of red, and of yellow, in<br>\
an animal]: (AA, O, K:) pl. سُنَجٌ, (O, K, TA,<br>\
in the CK سُنْجٌ,) like حُجَرٌ (K, TA, in the CK<br>\
like حُجْرٌ,) as pl. of حُجْرَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
سِنَاجٌ The mark, or effect, of the سِرَاج [i. e.<br>\
lamp, or its lighted wick], (A, O, K,) upon the<br>\
wall. (O, K, TA.) One says, لَابُدَّ لِلسِّرَاجِ مِنَ<br>\
السِّنَاجِ [The lamp, or its lighted wick, cannot but<br>\
have the mark, or effect, thereof upon the wall].<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The سِرَاج [itself; i. e. a lamp, or<br>\
its lighted wick]: (ISd, K:) as also ↓ سَنِيجٌ. (K.)<br>\
سَنِيجٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
بُرْدٌ مُسَنَّجٌ A [garment of the kind called] بُرْد<br>\
striped. (O, K.) [SM thinks that it may be a<br>\
mistranscription for مُسَبَّجٌ, meaning “ wide,” applied to a كِسَآء: but this I think improbable.]<br>\
