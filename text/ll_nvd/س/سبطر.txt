اِسْبَطَرَّ He stretched himself: (M:) he<br>\
lay upon his side, and stretched himself. (S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  He (a slaughtered beast) stretched himself to<br>\
die. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اسبطرّت الإِبِلُ فِى سَيْرِهَا The camels<br>\
hastened, (M, * K, * TA,) and stretched themselves,<br>\
in their march, or course. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اسبطرّت لَهُ<br>\
البِلَادُ The provinces became rightly disposed to<br>\
him. (Fr, K. *)<br>\
سِبَطْرٌ A lion stretching himself when about to<br>\
spring or leap. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A quick camel: pl.<br>\
سِبَطْرَاتٌ: it has no broken pl. (Sb, M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also,<br>\
the pl. above mentioned, Camels long, upon the<br>\
surface of the ground [or horizontally]. (S, K.)<br>\
The ت [says J] is not the denotative of the fem.<br>\
gender: (S:) it is like that in رِجَالَاتٌ (S, K)<br>\
and حَمَّامَاتٌ, as masc. pls.: (S:) but IB says,<br>\
the ت in this word is the denotative of the fem.<br>\
gender; for it is an epithet applied to جِمَالٌ,<br>\
which is fem. as a [broken] pl.; as is shown by<br>\
the saying الجِمَالُ سَارَتْ, and رَعَتْ, &amp;c.: and he<br>\
adds, J&#39;s saying that it is like رجالات and حمّامات<br>\
is a mistake, inasmuch as he confounds رجالات<br>\
with حمّامات; for رِجَالٌ is a fem. pl., as is shown<br>\
by one&#39;s saying الرِّجَالُ خَرَجَتْ, and سَارَتْ; but<br>\
حَمَّامٌ is masc., and should not regularly have a<br>\
pl. with ا and ت, but, as Sb says, it has this pl.<br>\
form, like some other masc. words, in lieu of a<br>\
broken pl., and would not have it if it had a<br>\
broken pl. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also the sing., Penetrating;<br>\
effective; (Lth, M, K;) [as though stretching<br>\
far;] sharp in intellect; clever; acute: (K: [in<br>\
the CK, الماضِى السَّهْمِ is put by mistake for<br>\
الماضى الشَّهْمُ:]) or sharp in intellect, and very<br>\
bold or daring or courageous. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Lank<br>\
hair. (M.) ―<br>\
-b6-  A man (Sh) lank and tall. (Sh,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And with ة, A corpulent woman. (M.)<br>\
سِبَطْرَى A proud and self-conceited gait, with<br>\
an affected inclining of the body from side to<br>\
side. (M, K.)<br>\
سُبَاطِرٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
سَبَيْطَرٌ and ↓ سُبَاطِرٌ Tall, or long. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also the former, A certain bird having a very<br>\
long neck, (S, K,) which one sees always in<br>\
shallow water; surnamed أَبُو العَيْزَارِ. (S.) [Freytag says, on the authority of Dmr, that it is also<br>\
called مالك الحزين. See art. ملك.]<br>\
