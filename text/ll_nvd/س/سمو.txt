of which the form of the verb first mentioned is<br>\
without teshdeed, while in the CK the first and<br>\
last are both alike with teshdeed, or, as is said in<br>\
the M, Th has mentioned سَمَوْتُهُ, but none other<br>\

meaning He pronounced the name of God, saying بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ (In the name of God), upon, or over,<br>\
a thing; such as food, and an animal about to be<br>\
slaughtered.] The Prophet said, سَمُّوا وَسَمِّتُوا وَدَنُّوا,<br>\
[cited, with some variations, and expl., in arts.<br>\
دنو and سمت,] meaning سَمُّوا اللّٰهَ [Pronounce<br>\
ye the name of God, &amp;c.]; i. e. whenever ye eat,<br>\
[before ye begin to do so, accord. to the general<br>\
custom, or] between two mouthfuls. (M.)<br>\

excellence, [or in an absolute sense,] with him;<br>\
syn. عَالَاهُ, (M,) or فَاخَرَهُ, and بَارَاهُ. (K.) It is<br>\
said in the trad. respecting the lie [against<br>\

in eminence (تُفَاخِرُهَا and تُعَالِيهَا) except Zeyneb;<br>\
المُسَامَاةُ meaning المُطَاوَلَةُ فِى الحُِظْوَةِ. (TA.) And<br>\

an affair, or event, before him; on the authority<br>\
of IAar; meaning [Verily before me is an affair,<br>\

بَاتَ ابْنُ أَدْمَآءَ يُسَامِى الأَنْدَرَا<br>\
سَامَى طَعَامَ الحَىِّ حَتَّى نَوَّرَا<br>\
and he says that سَامَى means اِرْتَفَعَ, and صَعِدَ;<br>\
but [it seems that the verse should be rendered,<br>\
Ibn-Admà passed the night aspiring to reach the<br>\
heap of reaped wheat: he aspired to attain the<br>\
wheat of the tribe until it attained to maturity:<br>\
for ISd says,] in my opinion he means, as the<br>\
seed-produce rose by growth, he rose to it, until<br>\
it attained to maturity, when he reaped it and<br>\
stole it: and he cites also the saying,<br>\
فَارْفَعْ يَدَيْكَ ثُمَّ سَامِ الحَنْجَرَا<br>\
[And raise thy hands, then endeavour to reach<br>\
the windpipe]; explaining سَامِ الحَنْجَرَ as meaning raise thy hands to his حَلْق [or throat, properly, fauces]. (M.)<br>\

immediately before the mention of this phrase in<br>\
the M as meaning the form, or figure, seen from<br>\

(السَّمَاوَة, S, M) a certain water in the desert<br>\

Altus fuit, eminuit; like سَمَا; but for this he<br>\
names no authority, and I find none for it.<br>\
-A2- ]<br>\
He named himself. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تسمّى بِزَيْدٍ He<br>\
was named Zeyd: (S, * M, * Msb, K: *) تسمّى<br>\
بِكَذَا means Such a thing became his name: it is<br>\
quasi-pass. of سَمَّاهُ and أَسْمَاهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\

superiority, [in highness, loftiness, or eminence,<br>\
or in glory, or excellence, or in an absolute sense,<br>\
(see 3,)] one with another. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  And<br>\
تساموا signifies also They called one another by<br>\
their names. (TA.)<br>\

استمى He (a hunter, or sportsman, [الصّاعِدُ<br>\
in the CK being a mistranscription for الصَّائِدُ,])<br>\
attired himself with the socks, or stockings, called<br>\
مِسْمَاة, (M, K, TA,) to protect himself from the<br>\
heat of the burning ground, (TA,) for the hunting of gazelles, in the time of heat. (M.) And<br>\
(M, in the K “ or ”) استماهُ He asked of him the<br>\
loan of the socks, or stockings, above named, for<br>\
that purpose, (M, K, *) i. e. for the hunting of<br>\
gazelles at midday. (TA.) And استمى, (M, CK,)<br>\
or استمى الظِّبَآءَ, (so in some copies of the K and<br>\
in the TA,) He sought, or pursued, the gazelles<br>\
in their caves, or hiding-places, (فَى غِيرَانِهَا, M,<br>\
and so in copies of the K, by the غِيرَان being<br>\
meant the كُنُس, M,) or in what was not their<br>\
time, or season, (فِى غَيْرِ انِهَا, thus in some copies<br>\
of the K,) at the auroral rising of Canopus<br>\
(سُهَيْل [which rose aurorally, in Central Arabia,<br>\
about the commencement of the era of the Flight,<br>\
on the 4th of August, O. S.]): (M, K:) so says<br>\
IAar. (M.) [Freytag says, on the authority of<br>\
scholia to the Deewán of Jereer, as follows: In<br>\
the time of the greatest heat, they drive out a<br>\
wild animal repeatedly from its hiding-place,<br>\
permitting it to return thither at night, when,<br>\
thus disturbed, it does not issue from its place;<br>\
in order that they may be able to strike it.] ―<br>\

took it in preference, or selected it. (IAar, L<br>\
voce اِقْتَرَحَ.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And IAar mentions the saying,<br>\
البَكْرَةُ مِنَ الإِبِلِ تُسْتَمَى بَعْدَ أَرْبَعَ عَشْرَةَ لَيْلَةً أَوْبَعْدَ<br>\
إِحْدَى وَعِشْرِينَ, as meaning [The youthful she-camel] is tested for the purpose of discovering<br>\
whether or not she be pregnant [after fourteen<br>\
nights or after one and twenty]: but Th disallows this, and says that the word is تُسْتَمْنَى,<br>\
from المُنْيَةُ, which means “ the period by the end<br>\
of which one knows whether or not the she-camel<br>\
is pregnant. ” (M.)<br>\
10<br>\
استسمى [or استسمى فُلَانًا, the word فلانا<br>\

سَمَآءٌ The higher, or upper, or highest, or uppermost, part of anything: [in this sense] masc.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [In its predominant acceptation,] a word<br>\
of well-known meaning; (K, TA;) i. e. (TA)<br>\
[The sky, or heaven;] the canopy of the earth:<br>\
(M, Msb, TA:) in this sense (M, Msb) masc.<br>\
and fem.; (IAmb, S, M, Msb, K; *) sometimes<br>\
fem.; (M;) rarely so, and thus as having the<br>\
next but one of the significations here following:<br>\
(Fr, Msb:) Az says that it is fem. because it is<br>\
pl. [or coll. gen. n.] of سَمَآءَةٌ: (TA:) or it is as<br>\
though it were pl. of ↓ سَمَاوَةٌ, [or rather its coll.<br>\
gen. n.,] like as سَحَابٌ is of سَحَابَةٌ: (Msb, TA:)<br>\
Er-Rághib says that the سَمَآء as opposed to the<br>\
أَرْض is fem., and sometimes masc.; and is used<br>\
as a sing. and as a pl.; as the latter in the<br>\
Kur ii. 27 [where it is shown to apply to seven<br>\
heavens]; and that it is like نَخْلٌ and شَجَرٌ and<br>\
other [coll.] gen. ns.: (TA:) in this sense (M)<br>\
the pl. is أَسْمِيَةٌ [a pl. of pauc.] (S, M, K) and<br>\
سُمِىٌّ, (M, K,) the latter [originally سُمُوىٌ] of<br>\
the measure فُعُولٌ, and both [also] pls. of سَمَآءٌ in<br>\
another sense, mentioned in what follows, (TA,)<br>\
and سَمَاوَاتٌ or سَمٰوَاتٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) and<br>\
accord. to the K, [in which all of these are mentioned as though pls. of سَمَآءٌ in all its senses,]<br>\
↓ سَمًا, [in the CK سُمًا,] but in the M سَمَآءٌ [like<br>\
the sing., as mentioned above], where it is said<br>\
that it must be a pl. in the Kur ii. 27 for the<br>\
reason already stated, as though pl. of سَمَآءَةٌ or<br>\
سَمَاوَةٌ; (TA;) and a poet assigns to سَمَآءٌ the<br>\
anomalous pl. سَمَآءٍ, by his saying,<br>\
سَمَآءُ الْإِلٰهِ فَوْقَ سَبْعِ سَمَآئِيَا<br>\
[The heaven of God, above seven heavens]: (S,<br>\
M:) the dim. is ↓ سُمّيَّةٌ. (Ham p. 452.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
Any canopy, or covering over-head, of a person.<br>\
(S, Msb, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And hence, (S, TA,) The<br>\
ceiling, or roof, (S, Msb, K, TA,) of a house, or<br>\
chamber, or tent, (S, K, TA,) and of anything;<br>\
(K, TA;) in this sense masc.; (Msb, TA;) and<br>\

رِوَاق, (M, K,) i. e. the شُقَّة [or oblong piece of<br>\
cloth] that is beneath the upper, or uppermost,<br>\
شُقَّةٌ, (M,) of a بَيْت [or tent]; (M, K;) in which<br>\
sense it is fem., and sometimes masc.; (M;) as<br>\
also ↓ سَمَاوَةٌ; (M, K;) [and so, app., ↓ سِمَايَةٌ;<br>\
for] one says, أَصْلَحَ سِمَايَتَهُ, with kesr, [He repaired his سماية,] meaning, his سَمَاوَة. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And The clouds; (Zj, K;) because of their<br>\
height: (Zj, TA:) or a cloud. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And<br>\
Rain; (S, M, Msb, K;) because it comes forth<br>\
from the سَمَآء [i. e. sky or clouds]: (TA:) or a<br>\
good rain (مَطْرَةٌ جَيِّدَةٌ): (K, TA:) or a new<br>\
rain (مَطْرَةٌ جَدِيدَةٌ): (T, TA:) or, as some say,<br>\
rain that has not fallen upon the earth; so called<br>\
in consideration of what has been said above [of<br>\
its meaning the “ clouds ” &amp;c.]: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) [but] one says, مَا زِلْنَا نَطَأُ السَّمَآءَ حَتَّى<br>\
أَتَيْنَاكُمْ [We ceased not to tread upon the rain<br>\
until we came to you]: (S, TA:) applied to rain,<br>\
it is masc., and fem. also because of its connexion<br>\
with the سَمَآء that canopies the earth; (M;) or<br>\
it is fem., as meaning سَحَابَةٌ: (Msb:) the pl. [of<br>\
mult.] is سُمِىٌّ (S, M, Msb, TA) and [of pauc.]<br>\
أَسْمِيَةٌ. (S, TA.) بَنُو مَآءِ السَّمَآءِ is an appellation<br>\
of The Arabs; [signifying the sons of the water<br>\
of the heaven;] because of their keeping much to<br>\
the deserts which are the places of the falling of<br>\
rain [by means of which they subsist]: or by<br>\
مَآء السمآء is meant Zemzem, which God made to<br>\
well forth for the Arabs, who are therefore like<br>\
the sons thereof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  [Hence, app., as<br>\
being likened to rain by reason of the swiftness<br>\
of his running,] a certain horse, (M, K,) belonging to Sakhr the brother of El-Khansà, (M,) was<br>\
named السَّمَآءُ. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b9-  [Hence, likewise, as<br>\
being likened to rain, (assumed tropical:)  Bounty.] One says,<br>\

from his store of bounty]. (A in art. رشح.) ―<br>\

and of Kudá&#39;ah, (M, TA,) mentioned by IAar,<br>\
(TA,) and ↓ سِمٌ and ↓ سُمٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ سَمٌ,<br>\
(K,) and ↓ سُمًا (M, K) and ↓ سِمًا and ↓ سَمًا, (K,)<br>\
[The name of a thing; i. e.] a sign [such as may<br>\
be uttered or written] conveying knowledge of a<br>\
thing; syn. عَلَامَةٌ: and a word applied to denote<br>\
a substance or an accident or attribute, for the<br>\
purpose of distinction: (M, K:) [or a substantive in the proper sense of this term, i. e. a real<br>\
substantive; and a substance in a tropical sense<br>\
of this term, i. e. an ideal substantive:] as expl.<br>\
by El-Munáwee, in the “ Towkeef,” the اسم is<br>\
that which denotes a meaning in itself unconnected<br>\
with any of the three times [past and present and<br>\
future]: if denoting what subsists by itself, it is<br>\
termed اِسْمُ عَيْنٍ; and if denoting what does not<br>\
subsist by itself, [i. e. an accident or attribute,]<br>\
whether existent, as العِلْمُ [i. e. knowledge], or<br>\
non-existent, as الجَهْلُ [i. e. ignorance], it is<br>\
termed اِسْمُ مَعْنًى: (TA:) the pl. is أَسْمَآءٌ [a pl.<br>\
of pauc.] and أَسْمَاوَاتٌ, (S, M, K,) the latter said<br>\
by Lh to be a pl. of اِسْمٌ, but it is rather a pl. of<br>\
أَسْمَآءٌ, for otherwise there is no way of accounting<br>\
for it, (M,) and أَسَامٍ (S, M, K) and أَسَامِىُّ (M,<br>\
K) are [likewise] pls. of أَسْمَآءٌ: (K, * TA:) the<br>\
word اسْمٌ [i. e. اِسْمٌ or اُسْمٌ] is derived from سَمَوْتُ,<br>\
(S, TA,) or from السُّمُوُّ, (Msb, Er-Rághib, TA,)<br>\
because the اسم is a means of raising into notice<br>\
the thing denoted thereby, and making it known:<br>\
(S, * Er-Rághib, TA:) it is of the measure اِفْعٌ [or<br>\
اُفْعٌ, accord. to different dialects], the last radical,<br>\
و, being wanting in it, (S, Msb, TA,) and the<br>\
hemzeh [or rather |] being prefixed by way of<br>\
compensation for it, accord to a general rule;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) for it is originally سِمْوٌ (S, Msb,<br>\
Er-Rághib, TA) or سُمْوٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) its pl.<br>\
being أَسْمَآءٌ, and its dim. being ↓ سُمَىٌّ [originally<br>\
سَمَيْوٌ]: (S, Msb, Er-Rághib, * TA:) some of the<br>\
Koofees hold that it is from الوَسْمُ, meaning<br>\
العَلَامَةُ, the و, which is the primal radical, being<br>\
rejected, and the hemzeh [or |] being substituted<br>\
for it, so that its measure is اِعْلٌ [or اُعْلٌ]; but<br>\
this is a weak opinion, for, were it so, the dim.<br>\
would be وَسَيْمٌ and the pl. would be أَوْسَامٌ. (Msb,<br>\
TA.) One says, اِسْمُ هٰذَا كَذَا [The name of this<br>\
is thus, or such a word]; and if you will you<br>\
may say, اُسْمُ هٰذا كذا; and in like manner,<br>\
↓ سِمُهُ and ↓ سُمُهُ: Lh says that اِسْمُهُ فُلَانٌ [His<br>\
name is Such a one] is the [common] phrase of<br>\
the Arabs; and he mentions اُسْمُهُ فُلَانٌ as heard<br>\
from [the tribe of] Benoo-&#39;Amr-Ibn-Temeem:<br>\
and Ks cites, as heard from some of [the tribe of]<br>\
Benoo-Kudá&#39;ah, the saying,<br>\
↓ بِاسْمِ الَّذِى فِى كُلِّ سُورَةٍ سُمُهْ<br>\
[In the name of Him whose name is in every<br>\
chapter of the Kur-án], and ↓ سِمُهْ as heard from<br>\
others, not of Kudá&#39;ah. (M.) سِرْ عَلَى اسْمِ اللّٰهِ is<br>\
an elliptical phrase [for سِرْ مُعْتَمِدًا عَلَى ذِكْرِ اسْمِ<br>\
اللّٰهِ Journey thou relying upon the mention of the<br>\
name of God]. (IJ, M in art. دل: see دَلِيلٌ.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اسْمٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  Fame, renown,<br>\
report, or reputation, of a person: (TA:) and so<br>\
↓ سُمًا, in relation to good, (K, TA,) not to evil;<br>\
mentioned by Az. (TA.) One says, ذَهَبَ اسْمُهُ<br>\
فِى النَّاسِ, i. e. His fame &amp;c. [went, or spread,<br>\
among mankind, or the people]. (TA.)<br>\
اِسْمِىٌّ [Of, or relating to, a name or noun or<br>\
substantive;] rel. n. from اِسْمٌ; as also ↓ سِمَوِىٌّ<br>\
and ↓ سُمَوِىٌّ. (S, TA.) [Hence, جُمْلَةٌ اسْمِيَّةٌ A<br>\
nominal proposition or phrase; as distinguished<br>\
from فِعْليَّةٌ, or verbal.]<br>\
[<br>\
اِسْمِيَّةٌ The quality of a name or noun or substantive.]<br>\
مِسْمَاةٌ The socks, or stockings, worn by a hunter,<br>\
(M, K, TA,) to protect him from the heat of the<br>\
burning ground. (TA.)<br>\
مُسَمًّى [Named]. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, هُوَ مِنْ<br>\
مُسَمَّى قَوْمِهِ and مُسَمَّاتِهِمْ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He is of the<br>\
best of his people or party. (TA.)<br>\
مُسَامٍ: see سَمِىٌّ.<br>\
