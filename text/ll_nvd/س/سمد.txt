سَمَدَ, (S, M, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
سَمُدَ, (M, L,) inf. n.<br>\
سُمُودٌ, He (a man, IAar) was, or became, high, or<br>\
elevated. (IAar, S, M, L, K. [عَلاءً in the CK is<br>\
a mistake for عَلا.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  He raised his head; (L;<br>\
[and the same is implied in the S; see سَامِدٌ;])<br>\
and so سَمِدَ: (M, L:) [and] he raised his head in<br>\
pride. (S, L, K.) And in the former sense it is<br>\
said of a camel, in his going along. (Bd in liii. 61.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also He (a man) stood, raising his head, and<br>\
with his breast erect; like as the stallion [camel]<br>\
does when excited by lust: (A:) [for] it is said of<br>\
a stallion [camel] when thus excited. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
hence, (A,) (tropical:)  He sang: (M, A, L:) because the<br>\
singer raises his head and erects his breast: (A:)<br>\
but Th says that this is rare: (M:) accord. to<br>\
I&#39;Ab, سُمُودٌ signifies the act of singing in the dial.<br>\
of Himyer. (L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also, (M, K,) aor. as above,<br>\
(TA,) and so the inf. n., (S, M,) (assumed tropical:)  He diverted<br>\
himself, sported, or played. (S, M, K, TA. [For<br>\
لَهِىَ in the CK, I read لَهَا, as in the M, and in<br>\
MS. copies of the K, and in the TA; and agreeably with the S, in which the inf. n. is expl. as<br>\
syn. with لَهْوٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b6-  He was, or became, negligent,<br>\
inattentive, inadvertent, inconsiderate, or heedless; and went away from, or relinquished, or<br>\
left, a thing. (L.) ―<br>\
-b7-  He was, or became, confounded, perplexed, or amazed, and unable to<br>\
see his right course; or affected with wonder;<br>\
or cut short, or silent, being confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his right course; syn.<br>\
بُهِتَ: inf. n. as above: (M:) [or] he stood confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his right<br>\
course; syn. قَامَ مُتَحَيِّرًا. (K. [After this explanation and لَهَا immediately following it, it is said<br>\
in the K, والسُّمُودُ يَكُونُ حُزْنًا وَسُرورًا: meaning<br>\
that it is by reason of grieving, or mourning, as<br>\
signifying the “ standing confounded ” &amp;c.; and<br>\
by reason of rejoicing, or being happy, as signifying the “ diverting oneself ” &amp;c. See as an ex. of<br>\
its usage in a case of grief the verses which I<br>\
have cited at the close of the first paragraph of<br>\
art. رد, and which are cited in the present art. in<br>\
the L and TA.]) ―<br>\
-b8-  Also He kept constantly, or<br>\
continually, (M, L,) to an affair, (M,) or upon<br>\
the ground, or in the land. (L.) ―<br>\
-b9-  He strove<br>\
laboured, or exerted himself, or he wearied himself, in work, (K, TA,) and in journeying. (TA.)<br>\
And سَمَدَتِ الإِبِلُ (S, M, K) فِى سَيْرِهَا, (S,) aor.<br>\
and inf. n. as above, (M,) The camels strove,<br>\
laboured, or exerted themselves, in their journeying: (S, K:) or knew not fatigue, or weariness.<br>\
(M.) [See also سَمْدٌ, (which is likewise, perhaps,<br>\
an inf. n. of the same verb,) below.]<br>\
-A2-  سَمَدَهُ,<br>\
inf. n. سَمْدٌ, i. q. قَصَدَهُ [He tended, repaired,<br>\
betook himself, or directed himself or his course or<br>\
aim, to, or towards, him, or it; or endeavoured<br>\
to reach, or attain, or obtain, him, or it; &amp;c.];<br>\
like صَمَدَهُ. (M.)<br>\
-A3-  And سَمَدَ الأَرْضَ, inf. n. سَمْدٌ,<br>\
He made the land, or ground, plain, or smooth,<br>\
or soft. (M.)<br>\
2<br>\
سمّدهُ, (M, TA,) inf. n. تَسْمِيدٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
diverted him: (M, TA:) [and in like manner,<br>\
↓ اسمدهُ; for] one says to a slave-songstress,<br>\
أَسْمِدِينَا, [in one of my copies of the S, erroneously,<br>\
اسْمُدِينَا,] meaning Divert thou us by singing.<br>\
(S, O, L, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  سمّد الأَرْضَ, (M, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. as above, (S, Msb, K,) He manured the<br>\
land with سَمَاد [q. v.]: (S, Msb, K:) he dunged,<br>\
or manured, the land; syn. زَبَّلَهَا. (M. [So in a<br>\
copy of the M: in the TA زبلها, without teshdeed;<br>\
and thus only, I believe, correctly; though it is<br>\
commonly pronounced with teshdeed in the present day.])<br>\
-A3-  سمد شَعَرَهُ, (M,) or الشَّعَرَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. as above, (TA,) He removed utterly his<br>\
hair, or the hair; (M, K, TA;) taking the whole<br>\
of it [in shaving]: a dial. var. of سبّد. (TA.)<br>\
تَسْمِيدُ الرَّأْسِ is The removing utterly the hair of<br>\
the head [by shaving]: a dial. var. of تَسْبِيد. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And تَسْمِيدٌ is also used [alone, the objective<br>\
complement being app. meant to be understood,]<br>\
as meaning The leaving off, or neglecting, the<br>\
anointing of oneself [or of one&#39;s hair], and washing: and so تَسْبِيدٌ. (A &#39;Obeyd, TA in art. سبد.)<br>\

إِسْمَاْدَّ see what next follows.<br>\
Q. Q. 4<br>\
اِسْمَأَدَّ, (S, M, L,) inf. n. اِسْمِئْدَادٌ, (S,)<br>\
He, or it, became swollen: (M, L:) or became<br>\
much swollen: (AZ, M, L:) or he (a man) became swollen with anger; (S, L;) or so ↓ اِسْمَادَّ,<br>\
inf. n. اِسمِيدَادٌ; and ↓ اِسْمَدَّ, inf. n. اِسْمِدَادٌ. (K.)<br>\
One says, اسمأدّت يَدَهُ His arm, or hand, became<br>\
swollen: and اسمأدّت رِجْلُهَا Her leg, or foot,<br>\
became inflated and swollen. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
said of anything, It went, or passed, away: or<br>\
perished; and so ↓ اسمدّ. (L, TA.) And اسمأدّ<br>\
مِنَ الغَضَبِ He perished by reason of anger. (L.)<br>\
سَمْدٌ Continuing, or unceasing, journeying.<br>\
(M, L.) [Perhaps an inf. n.: see سَمَدَتِ الإِبِلُ,<br>\
and what next precedes it, in the latter part of<br>\
the first paragraph.] ―<br>\
-b2-  هُوَ لَكَ سَمْدًا, (K, TA,) or<br>\
↓ سَمَدًا, (M,) [in my copy of the Mgh سمدًا, and<br>\
in the O سَمدًا,] He, or it, is thine ever, or for<br>\
ever; syn. سَرْمَدًا, (Th, M, Mgh, O, K,) and أَبَدًا.<br>\
(Th, M, Mgh.) And لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ سَمْدًا or ↓ سَمَدًا,<br>\
(M,) I will not do that ever. (M, TA.)<br>\
سَمَدًا: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
سَمَادٌ A compost, or manure, consisting of<br>\
سِرْجِين, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or سِرْقِين, (K,) [both<br>\
meaning dung of beasts, such as horses, camels,<br>\
sheep and goats, wild oxen, and the like,] with<br>\
ashes, (S, K,) or with earth or dust: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) or a manure consisting of strong earth.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
سَمِيدٌ i. q. حُوَّارَى (A, K) [app. as meaning<br>\
White, or whitened, flour: but said in the TK to<br>\
mean fine bread]: accord. to Kr, i. q. طَعَامٌ [app.<br>\
as meaning wheat]; and said by him to be with<br>\
the unpointed د: (K:) but more chastely, (K,)<br>\
and better known, (TA,) with ذ. (K, TA.) [In<br>\
the present day, applied to Semoulia; a kind of<br>\
paste made of very fine wheat-flour, reduced to<br>\
small grains. See also إِسْمِيدٌ, below.]<br>\
سَامِدٌ Any [man or animal] raising his head<br>\
[in pride or otherwise]. (S, M, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A man<br>\
standing: (IAar; and so in a copy of the S:) or<br>\
standing, raising his head, and with his breast<br>\
erect; (A, IAth;) as the stallion [camel] does<br>\
when excited by lust. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence, as is<br>\
indicated in the A, (see 1,)] (assumed tropical:)  A singer; or singing. (M, L; and so in two copies of the S.) And<br>\
the latter is said to be the meaning of the pl. in<br>\
the Kur liii. 61. (M, L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence also,] Behaving proudly. (I &#39;Ab in explanation of the pl.<br>\
in the Kur liii. 61; and IAar.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Diverting<br>\
himself; playing; or sporting. (IAar, S, M;<br>\
and Bd in liii. 61,) ―<br>\
-b6-  Negligent, inattentive,<br>\
inadvertent, inconsiderate, or heedless. (Lth,<br>\
IAar A.) Thus the pl. is said by Lth to mean<br>\
in the Kur liii. 61. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Standing in a state<br>\
of confusion, perplexity, or amazement: (Mgh:)<br>\
and so the pl. is said to mean in the Kur liii. 61:<br>\
(TA:) or confounded, perplexed, or amazed, by<br>\
reason of inordinate exultation. (IAar.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And<br>\
Silent. (So in a copy of the S.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And Grieving,<br>\
or mourning, and lowly, humble, or submissive.<br>\
(So, too, in a copy of the S.) ―<br>\
-b10-  In the saying of<br>\
Ru-beh, (K,) describing camels, (TA,)<br>\
سَوَامِدُ اللَّيْلِ خِفَافُ الأَزْوَادْ<br>\
the meaning is, Continuing journeying, (K,) or<br>\
striving, labouring, or exerting themselves, or<br>\
wearying themselves, [during the night,] having<br>\
no fodder in their bellies: (L:) F says that J has<br>\
erred in saying that the meaning is, “having no<br>\
fodder in their bellies: ” but this is the explanation<br>\
of the words خفاف الازواد, as IM and others have<br>\
expressly stated; and this necessarily indicates<br>\
that سوامد has the meaning assigned to it in the<br>\
K; so that no error is attributable to J in this<br>\
case: or, as some say, خفاف الازواد means not<br>\
having upon their backs [much] provision for the<br>\
riders. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  سَامِدٌ as an epithet applied to a<br>\
وَطْب [or skin in which milk is put] means (tropical:)  Full,<br>\
[so as to be] standing upright. (A, TA.)<br>\
إِسْمِيدٌ What is called in Persian سِمِدٌ [app. a<br>\
mistranscription for شَمَذْ, i. e. white bread]; an<br>\
arabicized word: [so says ISd; and he adds,] I<br>\
know not whether it be the same as سَمِيدٌ expl.<br>\
by Kr as signifying طَعَامٌ, or not. (M.)<br>\
مِسْمَدٌ i. q. زَبِيلٌ [i. e. A basket of palm-leaves;<br>\
probably one used for carrying سَمَاد, or manure]:<br>\
so says Lh; adding that one should not say<br>\
مِسْمَدَةٌ. (M.)<br>\
