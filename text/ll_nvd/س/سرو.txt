[See also جَرَادٌ.]<br>\
سَرِىٌّ, as an epithet applied to a man, (S, M,<br>\
K, &amp;c.,) may be from اِسْتَرَيْتُ الشَّىْءَ “ I chose, or<br>\
selected, the thing,” or from السَّرَاةُ “ the higher,<br>\

TA,) the only instance of فَعَلَةٌ as the measure of<br>\
a pl. of a word of the measure فَعِيلٌ, (S, Msb,)<br>\
or it is a quasi-pl. n., (Sb, M, K,) and its pl. is<br>\
سَرَوَاتٌ; (S, M, Mgh, * K;) meaning سَادَاتٌ [or<br>\
chiefs, &amp;c.]; (Mgh); and سُرَاةٌ, with damm, [originally سُرَوَةٌ,] is a dial. var. of سَرَاةٌ, as pl. [or<br>\
quasi-pl. n.] of سَرِىٌّ: (IAth, TA:) the pl. of<br>\
سَرِيَّةٌ is سَرِيَّاتٌ and سَرَايَا. (M, K.) Also Chosen,<br>\

measure فُعُّولَةٌ, from سَرْوٌ: see art. سر.<br>\
أَسْرَى is of the measure أَفْعَلُ [denoting the<br>\
comparative and superlative degrees] from السَّرْوُ<br>\
signifying “ liberality, bountifulness, munificence,<br>\
or generosity, combined with manliness, or manly<br>\
virtue: ” [&amp;c.:] whence the phrase أَسْرَاهُمْ سُودَدًا,<br>\
meaning The best of them in respect of chiefdom<br>\
or the like: or it may be from السُّرَى; meaning<br>\
in this instance that the fame of the chiefdom, or<br>\
the like, of him to whom it relates has pervaded<br>\
the countries and spread among mankind; and<br>\
this is more worthy of regard in respect of the<br>\
method of grammatical analysis; from Mtr:<br>\

locust in its first state, when it is a larva. (S.)<br>\
[In a copy of the M, it is said to be from السَّرْوَةُ;<br>\
and the context there indicates the meaning to<br>\
be A land infested by a worm of the kind termed<br>\
سَرْوٌ, of which سَرْوَةٌ is the n. un.: but probably<br>\
السَّرْوَةُ, in this instance, is a mistranscription for<br>\
السِّرْوَةُ, which is mentioned immediately after as<br>\
meaning “ the locust in its first state of growth,<br>\
when it comes forth from its egg. ”]<br>\
