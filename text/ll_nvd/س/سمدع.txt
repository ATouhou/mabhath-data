measure فَمَيْعَلٌ, from سَدْعٌ as syn. with ذَبْحٌ and<br>\
بَسْطٌ, (Sgh, TA,) pronounced by the vulgar سُمَيْدَع,<br>\
with damm to the س, (IDrst, TA,) which is a<br>\
mistake, (Th, IDrst, S, K, &amp;c.,) for there is not<br>\
in the language of the Arabs a noun of the<br>\
measure فُعَيْلَلٌ, (IDrst, TA,) A lord, master, chief,<br>\
prince, or man of rank or quality; (&#39;Eyn, S, O,<br>\
K;) to which Et-Teiyánee adds, from As, on the<br>\
authority of Munteji&#39; Ibn-Nebhán, (TA,) of easy<br>\
nature or disposition, generous, and very hospitable, or in whose vicinity his companion has power<br>\
or authority or dignity, not being harmed nor<br>\
inconvenienced; (S, K, TA;) and thus expl. by<br>\
AHát also; (TA;) generous; noble, or elevated<br>\
in rank; liberal, bountiful, or munificent: (O,<br>\
K:) and also (K) courageous: (Lth, K:) and<br>\
goodly, and stout, bulky, or corpulent: (AZ, EtTeiyánee:) pl. سَمَادِعُ. (IJ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The lion. (Ibn-Ed-Dahhán, T, S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, [accord. to<br>\
SM, but the reverse I think more probable,] (tropical:)  A<br>\
chief, or person of authority. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The<br>\
wolf; (En-Nadr, K;) because of his swiftness.<br>\
(En-Nadr.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And hence, (TA,) (tropical:)  A man active,<br>\
agile, or prompt, in accomplishing his wants.<br>\
(K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And A sword. (K.)<br>\
