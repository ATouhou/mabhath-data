سَكَتَ, (S, Msb, TA,) aor.<br>\
سَكُتَ, (Lth, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. سُكُوتٌ and سَكْتٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and سُكَاتٌ<br>\
(S, K) and سَاكُوتَةٌ, (K,) [all these ns. said in the<br>\
K to signify the same, but this is not exactly the<br>\
case, for the last is of an intensive form,] He<br>\
was, or became, silent, mute, or speechless; contr.<br>\
of نَطَقَ; (TA;) i. q. صَمَتَ: (Lth, Msb, TA:)<br>\
or سَكَتَ is said of him who has the power, or<br>\
faculty, of speech, but abstains from making use<br>\
of it; whereas صَمَتَ is sometimes said of that<br>\
which has not the power, or faculty, of speech:<br>\
(Er-Rághib, MF, TA:) or سَكَتَ, aor.<br>\
سَكُتَ, inf. n.<br>\
سُكُوتٌ and سَكْتٌ, signifies he (a man) ceased, or<br>\
stopped, speaking; and سَكَتَ, aor.<br>\
سَكُتَ, inf. n. سَكْتٌ,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  he (a man) was, or became, still, or quiet;<br>\
syn. سَكَنَ: (Zj, TA:) [it is said that] ↓ اسكت,<br>\
also, is syn. with صَمَتَ, like سَكَتَ; (Msb;)<br>\
accord. to AZ, one says of a man, صَمَتَ and<br>\
أَصَمَتَ and سَكَتَ and ↓ أَسْكَتَ: (TA:) or, as<br>\
some say, ↓ اسكت signifies he was, or became,<br>\
silent, or he spoke not; and he ceased [from<br>\
speech], or broke off [therefrom], or became cut<br>\
short [therein]: (Msb:) or سَكَتَ signifies he<br>\
was, or became, silent intentionally; and ↓ اسكت,<br>\
he was, or became, silent by reason of thought or<br>\
disease or fear: (TA:) or you say تَكَلَّمَ ثُمَّ سَكَتَ<br>\
without ا [when you mean he spoke and then<br>\
became silent, i. e., intentionally]; (S) but you<br>\
say ↓ اسكت when you mean his speech became<br>\
broken off, or cut short, and so he spoke not. (S,<br>\
K.) It is said in a prov., سَكَتَ أَلْفًا ونَطَقَ خَلْفًا<br>\
He held his tongue from a thousand words<br>\
(سَكَتَ عَنْ أَلْفِ كَلِمَةٍ), and then uttered what<br>\
was wrong. (ISk, S and Msb in art. خلف.) And<br>\
you say [of the quiescent ه that is sometimes<br>\
added at the end of a word, after a vowel or a<br>\
letter of prolongation, as in لَمْ يَرْضَهْ and وَا زَيْدَاهْ],<br>\
هٰذِهِ هَآءُ السَّكْتِ [This is the هاء of pausation].<br>\
(A, TA.) One says also, of a she-camel, سَكَتَتْ,<br>\
inf. n. سُكُوتٌ, meaning She uttered not the [grumbling] cry termed رُغَآء when the saddle was put<br>\
upon her. (ISd, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence سَكَتَ, aor. as<br>\
above, inf. n. سَكْتٌ, as syn. with سَكَنَ, meaning<br>\
as expl. above; and also (assumed tropical:)  It was, or became,<br>\
still, quiet, motionless, at rest, stilled, quieted,<br>\
appeased, tranquillized, calm, allayed, assuaged,<br>\
or quelled; it remitted; it subsided; and so<br>\
↓ اسكت.] You say, ضَرَبَهُ حَتَّى سَكَتَتْ حَرَكَتُهُ (A)<br>\
or حركته ↓ أَسْكَتَتْ (TA) (tropical:)  [He beat him until<br>\
his motion became stilled]; and ↓ حتّى أَسْكَتَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [until he became still]. (TA.) And سَكَتَ الغَضَبُ<br>\
i. q. سَكَنَ, (S, Msb, TA,) meaning فَتَرَ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
anger remitted; or became stilled, appeased, or<br>\
allayed]; (TA:) as also ↓ اسكت: (Msb:) and<br>\
سَكَتَ عَنْهُ الغَضَبُ (tropical:)  [Anger, or the anger, became<br>\
stilled so that it departed from him]. (A.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [vii. 153], وَلَمَّا سَكَتَ عَنْ مُوسَى<br>\
الغَضَبُ, (S,) meaning, accord. to Zj, سَكَنَ [i. e.<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  And when the anger became stilled so that it<br>\
departed from Moses]: or, as some say, the<br>\
phrase is inverted, the meaning being وَلَمَّا سَكَتَ<br>\
مُوسَى عَنِ الغَضَبِ [And when Moses was silent,<br>\
ceasing from anger]: but the former is the explanation of those skilled in the Arabic language.<br>\
(TA. [See also 4.]) You say also, سَكَتَ الحَرُّ,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  The heat became vehement, or intense,<br>\
the wind being still. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He died: (K:) occurring in this sense in a<br>\
trad. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  سَاكَتَنِى فَسَكَتُّ: see 3.<br>\
-A2-  سَكَتَ<br>\
said of a horse, [from السُّكَيْتُ,] He came in<br>\
tenth in a race. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
سَكَّتَ see 4, in two places.<br>\
3<br>\
سَاْكَتَ ↓ سَاكَتَنِى فَسَكَتُّ [may mean He kept silence<br>\
with me and I was silent: or he vied with me in<br>\
keeping silence and I surpassed therein: or it<br>\
may have both of these meanings; both being<br>\
agreeable with analogy]. (S, TA; in neither of<br>\
which it is explained.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسكت as an intrans. verb: see 1, in nine<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  He turned away, and spoke not; occurring in this sense in a trad.: and اسكت عَنِ<br>\
الشَّىْءِ He turned away from the thing. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
اسكتهُ and ↓ سكّتهُ (S, A, Msb) both signify the<br>\
same, said of God (S) [and of a man]; He made<br>\
him, or rendered him, silent, mute, or speechless;<br>\
(Msb;) [he silenced, or hushed, him;] namely, a<br>\
person speaking. (A.) And اسكتهُ عَنِى [He<br>\
made him to abstain from speaking of, or to, me].<br>\
(As, TA in art. نصت.) And اسكت الصَّبِىَّ بِسُكْتَةٍ<br>\
[He silenced, or hushed, the child with a سُكْتَة].<br>\
(Lh, S, A, K.) And أُسْكِتَ means He was<br>\
silenced in a dispute or the like. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[And hence, (assumed tropical:)  He stilled, quieted, appeased, tranquillized, calmed, allayed, assuaged, or quelled,<br>\
it.] In the Kur vii. 153, some read, ↓ وَلَمَّا سُكِتَ<br>\
عَنْ مُوسَى الغَضَبُ and أُسْكِتَ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  And when<br>\
the anger was stilled so that it was made to<br>\
depart from Moses]. (Bd. [For the usual reading see 1, latter part.])<br>\
سَكْتٌ an inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (S, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[hence,] A division [or pause] between two musical sounds, or notes, without breathing; (T, K,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ سَكْتَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also سِكِّيتٌ,<br>\
in two places.<br>\
سَكْتَةٌ A single state of silence, muteness, or<br>\
speechlessness. (Msb.) One says, لِلْجُبْلَى صَرْخَةٌ<br>\
ثُمَّ سَكْتَةٌ [To the pregnant woman is attributable<br>\
a vehement cry, then a silence]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In<br>\
prayer, A silence [or pause] after the commencement; [i. e. after what precedes the first recitation of the Opening Chapter of the Kur-án;]<br>\
which is approved: and, in like manner, after<br>\
the ending of the recitation of the Opening<br>\
Chapter of the Kur-án. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also<br>\
سَكْتٌ. ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A certain disease [by which a<br>\
person loses his powers of speech and motion],<br>\
(S, K, TA,) well known among the physicians;<br>\
(TA;) [i. e. apoplexy; thus called in the present<br>\
day:] accord. to some, the word in this sense<br>\
should be written ↓ سِكْتَةٌ, because it denotes a<br>\
mode [of silence or stillness]; but this is incorrect,<br>\
being at variance with the authority of transmission. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also the next paragraph:<br>\
-A2-<br>\
and see سِكِّيتٌ.<br>\
سُكْتَةٌ: see سِكْتَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A thing (S, A, Msb,<br>\
K) of any kind (S) with which one silences, or<br>\
hushes, or quiets, a child, (S, A, Msb, K,) or<br>\
other person; (S, K;) [generally meaning a<br>\
lullaby of any kind for a child:] and somewhat<br>\
remaining in a bag or other receptacle, (K, TA,)<br>\
i. e. of food. (TA.) One says, مَا لَهُ سُكْتَةٌ لِعِيَالِهِ,<br>\
and ↓ سَكْتَةٌ, meaning He has not any food with<br>\
which to silence, or quiet his family, or household. (Lh, TA.)<br>\
سِكْتَةٌ is a subst. from سَكَتَ; [signifying Silence,<br>\
&amp;c.; like سُكُوتٌ used as a subst.;] as also ↓ سُكْتَةٌ.<br>\
(Lh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also سَكْتَةٌ.<br>\
سُكَاتٌ Constant, or continual, silence. (Msb.)<br>\
Hence, by way of comparison, one says, الإِفْحَامُ<br>\
سُكَاتٌ [as though meaning The state of being<br>\
silenced in a dispute, &amp;c., is a state of constant,<br>\
or continual, silence: but it seems to mean, more<br>\
probably, الافحام (as an act. inf. n.) is an act<br>\
that silences; agreeably with what here follows].<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَمَاهُ بِسُكَاتٍ (AZ, M, K) and ↓ سُكَاتَةٍ,<br>\
(AZ, S, M, A, K,) to which latter is generally<br>\
added وَصُمَاتَةٍ, (M, TA,) He (a man, S, M, and<br>\

thing that silenced him; (S, A, K;) thought by<br>\
ISd to mean, with anxiety, or grief, that silenced<br>\
him, or a thing in consequence of which he became<br>\
silent: not expl. by AZ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [In like<br>\
manner] one says also, ↓ رَمَاهُ بِالمُسْكِتَاتِ [He<br>\
smote him, or afflicted him, with the words, or<br>\
acts, that silenced him]. (T in art. رم, from<br>\
Aboo-Málik.) And بِهِ سُكَاتٌ [He has in him<br>\
that which makes him silent]: said of one long<br>\
silent in consequence of disease (A, TA) or of<br>\
some evil in him. (TA.) And أَصَابَ سُكَاتًا He<br>\
met with, or experienced, a disease that prevented<br>\
him from speaking. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  هُوَعَلَى سُكَاتِ الأَمْرِ<br>\
He is at the point of accomplishing the affair.<br>\
(K.) And كُنْتُ عَلَى سُكَاتِ هٰذِهِ الحَاجَةِ I was<br>\

سُكَيْتٌ: see سِكِّيتٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  السُّكَيْتُ and ↓ السُّكَّيْتُ,<br>\

teshdeed, (S,) the former being the more common, (Msb,) The tenth horse in a race; i. e. the<br>\
last of them; (Msb;) the last horse among those<br>\
that start together in a race, (S, K,) of the ten<br>\
that are reckoned; (S;) also called الفِسْكِلُّ (S,<br>\
Msb) and القَاشُورُ; those that come in after this<br>\
one not being reckoned. (S.) The other nine<br>\
are thus called, beginning with the first of these:<br>\
المُجَلِّى, المُصَلِّى, المُسَلِّى, التَّالِى, المُرْتَاحُ, العَاطِفُ,<br>\
الحَظِىُّ, المُؤَمَّلُ, and اللَّطِيمُ. (TA.) Sb says that<br>\
سُكَيْتٌ is a contracted dim. of سُكَّيْتٌ; the uncontracted dim. of which is سُكَيْكِيتٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence,] one says, فُلَانٌ سُكَيْتُ الحَلْبَةِ [lit. Such<br>\
a one is the tenth horse of those that are started<br>\

constantly, or continually, silent: (S in explanation<br>\
of the first and second:) or much, or often, silent,<br>\
(Msb in explanation of the first, and K in explanation of all above-cited therefrom,) restraining himself from speech; (Msb;) and ↓ سَكْتٌ<br>\
signifies the same: (K:) and ↓ this last, [which<br>\
is originally an inf. n., and therefore used as an<br>\
intensive epithet, like عَدْلٌ &amp;c.,] (AZ, K,) and<br>\
↓ سَاكُوتٌ and ↓ سَاكُوتَةٌ and ↓ سَكْتَةٌ, (TA,) [but<br>\
the last, which is written in the TA without any<br>\
syll. signs, is doubly intensive, as is also that<br>\
next preceding it,] a man who speaks little, (AZ,<br>\
K, TA,) without inability to express his mind, or<br>\

mixed multitude; or the lowest or basest or meanest sort, or refuse, or riffraff]: (Lh, K:) IAar<br>\
does not assign to it a sing.: some say that its<br>\
sing. is سكت [app. سَكْتٌ]; but this demands<br>\
consideration. (TA.)<br>\
إِسْكَاتَةٌ, of the measure إِفْعَالَةٌ from السُّكُوتُ; A<br>\
silence [or pause] of short duration, requiring<br>\
something to be said or read or recited after it:<br>\
or an abstaining from elevating the voice in<br>\
speech; not an absolute silence, in which one<br>\
ceases, or abstains, from reading or reciting or<br>\
speaking; for it occurs in a trad. in the words,<br>\

of the Divine Essence. (TA in art. حكم, q. v.)<br>\
