from [the Pers.] سَادَهْ: (O, K: [in some copies of<br>\
the K سَاذَهْ:]) this is the only explanation in some<br>\
of the copies of the K: (TA:) Plain; i. e. without variegation, decoration, embellishment, or<br>\
engraved or sculptured work: (O, TA:) or without any hair upon it: or of one unmixed colour:<br>\
this last is [said to be] the correct meaning [in<br>\
many instances]; but the sheykh Welee-ed-Deen<br>\
El-&#39;Irákee says, in the Expos. of the “ Sunan ”<br>\
of Aboo-Dáwood, respecting a pair of boots of the<br>\
Prophet, described as خُفَّانِ أَسْوَدَانِ سَاذَجَانِ or<br>\
سَاذِجَانِ, that this phrase seems to mean A pair<br>\
of black boots of one unmixed colour; the last<br>\
word being used in this sense in the common<br>\
conventional language; though he had not found<br>\
it with this meaning in the lexicons, nor in the<br>\
books of authors on the strange words occurring<br>\
in traditions. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Free from self-constraint: and one who knows not badness, wickedness, deceit, or guile; in whom is no latent rancour,<br>\
malevolence, malice, or spite, nor cunning: (O:)<br>\
or free in intellect; and easy [or simple or artless]<br>\
in nature or disposition. (TA in art. سدج.) ―<br>\

حُجَّةٌ سَاذَجَةٌ, also written سَاذِجَةٌ, is used by<br>\
authors on the scholastic theology of the Muslims<br>\
as meaning An argument, a plea, an allegation,<br>\
an evidence, or a testimony, that is undecisive:<br>\
and sometimes the same epithet is used [in like<br>\
manner] in other cases. (L.)<br>\
-A2-  In some copies<br>\
of the K, it is said to be [the name of] Certain<br>\
roots and shoots, that grow in waters, useful for<br>\
such and such things; arabicized from ساذه [or<br>\
سَادَهْ]: (TA:) or certain leaves and shoots, (O,<br>\
CK,) used as a medicine, having a flower; one<br>\
sort thereof called رُومِىٌّ; and another, هِنْدِىٌّ;<br>\
[the latter name, i. e. سَاذَجٌ هِنْدِىٌّ, as well as سَاذَجٌ<br>\
alone, applied in the present day to malabathrum,<br>\
or Indian spikenard;] growing in waters that<br>\
collect and stagnate in black muddy lands, (O,)<br>\
standing up on the surface of the water, (O,<br>\
CK,) like the plant called عَدَسُ المَآءِ, (O,) without attachment to a root; (O, CK;) beneficial<br>\
for swellings of the eye. (CK.)<br>\
