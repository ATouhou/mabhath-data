سَجَدَ, (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) [aor.<br>\
سَجُدَ,] inf. n.<br>\
سُجُودٌ, (Msb,) He was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive; syn. خَضَعَ, (S, A, K, TA,) or<br>\
تَطَامَنَ, and ذَلَّ: (Msb:) or he bent him-self down<br>\
towards the ground: (Aboo-Bekr, TA: [and<br>\
such is often meant by خَضَعَ and by تَطَامَنَ:])<br>\
[or it has both of these significations combined;<br>\
i. e. he was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive, bending himself down; for] the primary<br>\
signification of السُّجُودُ is تَذَلُّلً together with<br>\
تَطَأْمُنٌ [or تَطَامُنٌ]. (Bd in ii. 32.) And ↓ اسجد<br>\
He lowered his head, and bent himself; (AA, S,<br>\
Mgh, K;) said of a man; (AA, S, Mgh;) and<br>\
put his forehead on the ground: (Mgh:) and<br>\
likewise said of a camel; (S, A;) in the latter<br>\
case tropical; (A;) as also سَجَدَ; (A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) meaning (tropical:)  he lowered his head, (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) to be ridden, (S, Mgh,) or to his<br>\
rider, (A,) or on the occasion of his being ridden,<br>\
or mounted. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The سُجُود of prayer is<br>\
from سَجَدَ in the first of the senses expl. above;<br>\
(S;) and means The [prostrating oneself;] putting the forehead on the ground: (S, Mgh:)<br>\
سَجَدَ, (ISd, Msb, TA,) aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
(ISd, TA,) signifies he put his forehead on the<br>\
ground: (ISd, Msb, TA:) but سُجُود to God<br>\
denotes a particular manner [of doing this; i. e.<br>\
the prostrating oneself in prayer by dropping<br>\
gently upon the knees, placing the palms of the<br>\
hands on the ground, a little before the place of<br>\
the knees, and then putting the nose and forehead<br>\
on the ground, the former first, between the two<br>\
hands]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is said of Kisrà, in a trad.,<br>\
كَانَ يَسْجُدْ لِلطَّالِع, i. e. He used to lower himself, or bend himself down, to the arrow passing<br>\
beyond the butt, going over it; which they used<br>\
to reckon like that which hit the butt; meaning<br>\
that he used to concede to the shooter thereof:<br>\
or, accord. to Az, it means that he used to lower<br>\
his head when his arrow was elevated [too high]<br>\
above the object shot at, in order that the arrow<br>\
might be rightly directed, and might hit the<br>\
circle. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And [as salutation is often<br>\
accompanied with a bending of the body,] سُجُودٌ<br>\
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The act of saluting. (L, TA.)<br>\
[You say, سَجَدَ لَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He saluted him. And also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He paid respect, or honour, to him; or magnified him; see Ham p. 294.] ―<br>\
-b5-  You say also,<br>\
سَجَدَتِ النَّخْلَةُ (tropical:)  The palm-tree bent, or inclined,<br>\
(AHn, Mgh, TA,) by reason of the abundance of<br>\
its fruit. (Mgh.) And السَّفِينَةُ تَسْجُدُ لِلرِّيحِ (tropical:)  The<br>\
ship bends, or inclines, by the influence of the<br>\
wind. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  وَ النَّجْمُ وَ الشَّجَرُ يَسْجُدَانِ, in<br>\
the Kur [lv. 5], means, accord. to Fr, (assumed tropical:)  [And<br>\
the herbs and the trees] turn towards the sun<br>\
and incline with it until the afternoon-shade becomes broken: (TA:) or the herbs and the trees<br>\
humbly submit to his will. (Bd, Jel.) The سُجُود<br>\
of inanimate things to God we understand, in the<br>\
Kur, as denoting obedience to that whereto they<br>\
are made subservient, and as a fact to be believed<br>\
without inquiry into the manner thereof. (I&#39;Ab,<br>\
L.)<br>\
-A2-  Also He stood erect: (Lth, Msb, K:) so<br>\
in the dial. of Teiyi. (Msb.) It is said in the<br>\
K, immediately after the mention of the first<br>\
signification and this last, that thus the verb has<br>\
two contr. meanings: but it may be said that<br>\
there is no [necessary, or absolute,] contrariety<br>\
between الخُضُوع and الاِنْتِصَاب. (MF.)<br>\
-A3-  سَجِدَتْ<br>\
رِجْلُهُ, aor.<br>\
سَجَدَ, (tropical:)  His leg became inflated, or swollen. (K, TA.)<br>\

and tranquilly: (TA:) or he looked continuedly,<br>\
(S, K,) and lowered the eyelids in a languid, or<br>\
languishing, manner, (S, [the inf. n. being there<br>\
expl. by إِدَامَةُ النَّظَرِ وَ إِمْرَاضُ الأَجْفَانِ,]) or lowering the eyelids [&amp;c.], (K, * TK,) with a look<br>\
indicative of [amorousness, and feigned coyness<br>\
or opposition, or] confidence in one&#39;s love, and<br>\
consequent presumptuousness: (TA:) or he had a<br>\
languid, or languishing, eye. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اسجدت<br>\
عَيْنَهَا (tropical:)  She lowered her eye. (A, TA.)<br>\

prostrating oneself in prayer or the like: pl.<br>\

much, or frequently, in prayer or the like].<br>\
(A, TA.)<br>\
سَجَّادَةٌ A [small mat, such as is termed] خُمْرَة,<br>\
(S, Mgh, L, TA,) [of an oblong shape, and a<br>\
small oblong carpet,] upon which one prostrates<br>\
himself [and stands and sits in prayer]; (L,<br>\
TA;) also called ↓ سُجَّادَةٌ, (A, TA,) and ↓ مِسْجَدَةٌ.<br>\

and vii. 161], means And enter ye the gate bending down your heads: (I&#39;Ab, K:) it was a narrow<br>\

-b3-  And سُجَّدًا لِلّٰهِ, in the<br>\
Kur xvi. 50, means (tropical:)  Humbling themselves to<br>\
God, with subserviency. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  You say also<br>\
شَجَرَةٌ سَاجِدَةٌ, and شَجَرٌ سَاجِدٌ and سَوَاجِدُ, [this<br>\
last word being pl. of سَاجِدَةٌ,] (tropical:)  A tree, and trees,<br>\

thus some relate it, with kesr to the ء, (O, K,)<br>\
in the saying of El-Aswad Ibn-Yaafur.<br>\
مِنْ خَيْرِ ذِى نَطَفٍ أَغَنَّ مُنَطَّقٍ<br>\
وَافَى بِهَا لِدَرَاهِمِ الإِأَسْجَادِ<br>\
[Of the wine of one with earrings, having a nasal<br>\
twang, girded with a waist-belt, i. e., of a<br>\
foreigner: he brought it for what are termed<br>\
دراهم الاسجاد], (S, * O, K, but in the copies of the<br>\
K كَدَرَاهِم, [which I think a mistranscription,])<br>\
means dirhems whereon were effigies to which<br>\
people performed the act of سُجُود: (S, O, K:)<br>\
it is said that upon them was the effigy of Kisrà,<br>\
and he who beheld them lowered his head to them<br>\
and showed humility [as the Persians in the present day do to the picture of their King]: (IAmb,<br>\
TA:) or الأَسْجَاد means the tax called جِزْيَة:<br>\
(O, K:) so says AO, (O,) or A &#39;Obeyd: (TA:)<br>\
or the Jews and the Christians: (O, K:) some<br>\
say the former and some say the latter: (O:)<br>\
and it is read with kesr to the ء, and expl. as<br>\
meaning the Jews, (O, K,) by IAar. (O.) [Whatever be the signification of the last word, the<br>\
verse plainly means, “of wine of a foreigner, sold<br>\
by him for foreign money. ”]<br>\
مَسْجَدٌ The forehead, (S, K,) where is the<br>\
mark made by the سُجُوَد [or prostration in<br>\
prayer]. (S.) [Said in the TA to be tropical;<br>\
but not so accord. to the A.] And sing. of<br>\
مَسَاجِدُ which signifies The parts of a man that<br>\
are the places of سُجُود; (Lth, Mgh, Msb, L;)<br>\
المَسَاجِدُ meaning the forehead, the nose, the<br>\
hands, the knees, and the feet: (Mgh, L:) or<br>\
the forehead, the hands, and the knees: (Mgh:)<br>\
or the seven آرَاب; (S, K;) namely, the forehead,<br>\
the hands, the knees, and the feet: (TA in art.<br>\
ارب:) such, accord. to some, is its meaning in<br>\
the Kur lxxii. 18. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
مَسْجِدٌ [Any place in which one performs the<br>\
act of سُجُود, or acts of worship or devotion;<br>\
and particularly a mosque; a Muslim temple;<br>\
an oratory;] a house in which one performs the<br>\
act of سُجُود; (IB;) a house of prayer; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) any place in which one performs acts of<br>\
worship or devotion: (Zj:) a word of well-known<br>\
meaning; (K;) sing. of مَسَاجِدُ; (S, Mgh, K;)<br>\
and also pronounced ↓ مَسْجَدٌ: (S, K:) this latter<br>\
word signifies, accord. to IAar, the مِحْرَاب [here<br>\
meaning oratory, or place of private prayer,] of<br>\
a house; and the place of prayer of the congregations; (TA;) or it signifies any of the parts<br>\
of the ground, as well as of the body, that are the<br>\
places of سُجُود: (Lth, L:) or the place of the<br>\
forehead [on the ground in the act of prostration<br>\
in prayer]. (IB.) Fr says, (S,) the مَفْعل of<br>\
every verb of the class of فَعَلَ having its aor. of<br>\
the measure يَفْعُلُ is with fet-h to the medial<br>\
radical letter, whether it be a subst, or an inf. n.,<br>\
(S, K,) without any difference, so that you say,<br>\
دَخَلَ مَدْخَلًا, and هٰذَا مَدْخَلُهُ; (S;) except some<br>\
words (S, K) among substs., (S,) as مَسْجِدٌ and<br>\
مَطْلِعٌ (S, K) and مَغْرِبٌ (S) and مَشْرِقٌ and مَسْقِطٌ<br>\
and مَفْرِقٌ and مَجْزِرٌ and مَسْكِنٌ and مَرْفِقٌ (S, K)<br>\
from رَفَقَ, aor. يَرْفُقُ, (S,) and مَنْبِتٌ and مَنْسِكٌ<br>\
(S, K) from نَسَكَ, aor. يَنْسُكُ; (S;) these being<br>\
with kesr (S, K) to the medial radical letter (K)<br>\
as a sign of their being substs.; but sometimes<br>\
some of the Arabs pronounce it with fet-h in the<br>\
subst.: مَسْكِنٌ and مَسْكَنٌ have been transmitted;<br>\
and we have heard المَسْجِدُ and ↓ المَسْجَدُ, and<br>\
المَطْلِعُ and المَطْلَعُ: and he further says, (S,)<br>\
fet-h is allowable, (S, K,) in all of these, (S,)<br>\
even if we have not heard it: but when the verb<br>\
is of the class of فَعَلَ having its aor. of the<br>\
measure يَفْعِلُ, the n. of place [or time] is with<br>\
kesr, and the inf. n. is with fet-h, to distinguish<br>\
the one from the other; so that you say, نَزَلَ مَنْزَلًا,<br>\
meaning نُزُولًا, and هٰذَا مَنْزِلُةُ, meaning دَارُهُ. (S,<br>\
K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence مَسْجِدٌ جَامِعٌ A congregational<br>\
mosque; i. e. a mosque in which a congregation<br>\
assembles to perform the Friday-prayers.] المَسْجِدُ<br>\
الحَرَامُ [The sacred mosque of Mekkeh]. (Msb<br>\
in art. حرم.) المَسْجِدُ الأَقْصَى The furthest mosque<br>\
[which is in Jerusalem]. (Msb in art. قصو.)<br>\
مَسْجِدُ الخَيْفِ The mosque of the خَيْف [q. v.]<br>\
in Minè. (S &amp;c. in art. خيف.) And المَسْجِدَانِ<br>\
The two mosques; that of Mekkeh and that of<br>\
El-Medeeneh: (S, Mgh:) so in a verse cited in<br>\
the first paragraph of art. ثرو. (S.)<br>\
