(M, K;) and so ↓ سالف, said of a camel. (K.)<br>\
In a verse cited voce سَلْفَ رَدَادٌ is used by poetic<br>\
license for سَلَفَ: but this kind of contraction is<br>\
allowed by the Basrees only in verbs of which<br>\
the medial radical letter is with kesr or damm, as<br>\
in عَلْمَ for عَلِمَ, and كَرْمَ for كَرُمَ. (M. [See<br>\
سَرُعَ.]) ―<br>\

-b4-<br>\
[Golius and Freytag mention also سَلَفَ as a<br>\
trans. verb; the former explaining it as signifying<br>\
“ Præteriit, præcessit, rem; ” and the latter adding<br>\
“ tempore,” and assigning to it the inf. ns. سَلْفٌ<br>\
and سُلُوفٌ; as on the authority of the K; in<br>\
which I find no indication of such a usage of this<br>\
verb.]<br>\
-A2-  سَلَفَ الأَرْضَ, (S, M, K;) aor.<br>\
سَلُفَ, inf. n.<br>\
سَلْفٌ; (S, M;) and ↓ اسلفها; (M, K;) He turned<br>\

الأَرْضِ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K,) inf. n. مُسَالَفَةٌ, (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, TA,) i. q. سَايَرَهُ [i. e. He went, or kept<br>\

advance to him for such a thing, &amp;c.]. (Msb.)<br>\
Hence the saying in a trad., فَيُسَلِّفْ ↓ مَنْ سَلَّفَ<br>\
فِى كَيْلٍ مَعْلُومٍ وَوَزْنٍ مَعْلُومٍ إِلَى أَجَلٍ مَعْلُومٍ i. e.<br>\
He who pays in advance for a commodity for<br>\
which the seller is responsible, let him pay in<br>\

(M, Mgh, TA,) He lent him property [to be<br>\

تسلّف He received payment in advance:<br>\
and ↓ استسلف [perhaps a mistranscription for<br>\

hence,] تسلّف مِنْهُ He received from him a<br>\
loan; syn. اِقْتَرَضَ; as also ↓ استلف. (A in art.<br>\
قرض.) And تسلّف مِنْهُ كَذَا He received as a<br>\

سَلَفٌ Such as have gone before, or preceded;<br>\
(M, Msb; *) [i. e. the preceding generations;] as<br>\
also ↓ سَلِيفٌ and ↓ سُلْفَةٌ and ↓ سَلُوفٌ; all quasipl. ns.; (M;) of which the sing. is ↓ سَالِفٌ: (M,<br>\
Msb: *) or such as have gone before, or preceded,<br>\
of a man&#39;s ancestors (S, K) and of his relations,<br>\
(K,) that are above him in age and in excellence;<br>\
[but this addition is not always agreeable with<br>\
usage;] one of whom is termed ↓ سَالِفٌ: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. of سَلَفٌ is أَسْلَافٌ and سُلَّافٌ, (S, K,) [the<br>\
former a pl. of pauc. and the latter of mult.,] or<br>\
the latter is pl. of ↓ سَالِفٌ, and so is سَلَفٌ [said to<br>\
be, though this is more properly termed, as it is<br>\
in the M, a quasi-pl. n.]: (IB, Msb, TA:) and,<br>\
accord. to Zj, سُلُفٌ is pl. of ↓ سَلِيفٌ, and سُلَفٌ is<br>\
pl. of ↓ سُلْفَةٌ, which means a company (عُصْبَةٌ)<br>\
that has passed away: (M:) or ↓ سَالِفٌ and<br>\
↓ سَلِيفٌ signify the same; going before; preceding; syn. مُتَقَدِّمٌ. (S.) [Accord. to Abu-lMahásin, السَّلَفُ is particularly applied to &#39;Áïsheh<br>\
the wife of Mohammad, the three Khaleefehs<br>\
Aboo-Bekr and &#39;Omar and &#39;Othmán, Talhah and<br>\
Ez-Zubeyr, the Khaleefeh Mo&#39;áwiyeh, and &#39;Amr<br>\
Ibn-El-Ás. (De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Ar., sec. ed.,<br>\
i. 156.)] And السَّلَفُ الصَّالِحُ is applied to the<br>\
first chief persons of the Tábi&#39;ees. (TA.) And<br>\
السَّلَفُ المُقَدَّمُ is an appellation of the prophet<br>\
Mohammad. (Ham p. 780.) [Hence, مَذَاهِبُ<br>\
السَّلَفِ The tenets of the early Muslims.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
A people, or party, going before, or preceding, in<br>\
journeying. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [simply] A company<br>\
of men; as in the saying, جَآءَنِى سَلَفٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ<br>\
[A company of men came to me]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
Any good, or righteous, deed, that one has done<br>\
beforehand [by way of preparing a future reward]: or any فَرَط [i. e. cause of reward, or<br>\
recompense, in the world to come, such as a child<br>\
dying in infancy], that [as it were] goes before<br>\
one. (A &#39;Obeyd, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And i. q. سَلَمٌ; (T,<br>\
Hr, Mgh, O, K, TA;) i. e. Any money, or property, paid in advance, or beforehand, as the<br>\
price of a commodity for which the seller has<br>\
become responsible and which one has bought on<br>\
description: (T, TA:) or payment for a commodity to be delivered at a certain [future]<br>\
period with something additional to [the equivalent of] the current price at the time of such payment; this [transaction] being a cause of profit<br>\
to him who makes such payment; and سَلَمٌ also<br>\
has this meaning: (TA:) or a sort of sale in<br>\
which the price is paid in advance, and the commodity is withheld, on the condition of description, to a certain [future] period: (S, O:) it is<br>\
a subst. from الإِسْلَافُ. (Msb, * K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And<br>\
A loan (قَرْضٌ) in which is no profit (Hr, O,<br>\
Mgh, K, TA) to the lender (Hr, O, K, TA)<br>\
except recompense [in the world to come] and<br>\
thanks, (TA,) and which it is incumbent on the<br>\
recipient thereof to return as he received it: (Hr,<br>\
O, K, TA:) thus the Arabs term it: (Hr, O,<br>\
TA:) and in this sense also the word is a subst.<br>\
from الإِسْلَافُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A stallion-camel.<br>\
(IAar, M, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, (M,) or ↓ سُلْفَةٌ, (O,<br>\
TA,) The prepuce of a boy; (M, O, TA;) so<br>\
says Lth; (O, TA;) and ↓ سَلِفٌ and ↓ سِلْفٌ<br>\
signify the same; for this is meant by الجِلْدُ as<br>\
an explanation of السَّلِفُ and السِّلْفُ in the K, in<br>\
some copies of which الخُلْدُ is erroneously put<br>\
for الجِلْدُ. (TA.)<br>\
سَلِفٌ and ↓ سِلْفٌ The husband of the sister of<br>\
the wife of a man: (S, K:) and [the duals]<br>\
سَلِفَانِ (M, TA) and ↓ سِلْفَانِ (M, K) signify the<br>\
two husbands of two sisters: (M, K:) accord. to<br>\
IAar, the epithet سَلِفَةٌ [or ↓ سِلْفَةٌ] is not applied<br>\
to a woman; (M;) one only uses the term سَلِفَانِ<br>\
applied to two men: (M:) or, (M, K,) accord. to<br>\
Kr, سَلِفَتَانِ, (M,) or ↓ سِلْفَتَانِ, (K,) is applied to<br>\
the two wives of two brothers: (M, K:) [in the<br>\
present day, ↓ سِلْفَةٌ is used as meaning a woman&#39;s<br>\
husband&#39;s sister, and her brother&#39;s wife:] the pl.<br>\
applied to men is أَسْلَافٌ, (M, K, TA,) and that<br>\
applied to women is سَلَفٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
سَلَائِفُ, last sentence.<br>\
سَلَفٌ The young one of the حَجَل [or partridge]: (S, M, K:) or, accord. to Kr, of the قَطَاة<br>\
[n. un. of قَطًا, q. v.]: (M:) AA says that he had<br>\
not heard سُلَفَةٌ, applied to the female; but if one<br>\
said سُلَفَةٌ, like as one says سُلَكَةٌ as meaning a<br>\
single female of what are termed سِلْكَانِ, it would<br>\
be approvable: (S:) the pl. is سِلْفَانِ (S, M, K)<br>\
and سُلْفَانٌ: (M, K:) some say that سِلْفَانٌ signifies<br>\
a species of bird, not particularized. (M.) [See<br>\
also سُلَحٌ and سُلَكٌ.]<br>\
سُلْفَةٌ: see سَلَفٌ, first sentence, in two places.<br>\
[Hence,] one says, جَاؤُوا سُلْفَةً سُلْفَةً, meaning<br>\
They came [one before another; or, which is<br>\
virtually the same,] one after, or near after, or<br>\
at the heels of, another. (AZ, K.) ―<br>\

portion of food (S, M, TA) which a man takes<br>\
betimes, (S,) or with which one contents, or<br>\
satisfies, himself [so as to allay the craving of his<br>\
stomach], (M,) before the [morning-meal called]<br>\
غَدَآء; (S, M, TA;) i. q. لُمْجَةٌ (K, TA) and لُهْنَةٌ:<br>\
(TA:) or a لُهْنَة that is supplied betimes for a<br>\
guest, before the غَدَآء. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And السُّلْفَة also<br>\
signifies That which a woman reposits, or prepares, or provides, [app. of food,] to present to<br>\
her visiter. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A piece, or portion,<br>\
of land of seed-produce made even [with the<br>\
مِسْلَفَة, q. v.]: pl. سُلَفٌ. (Az, O, K.)<br>\
-A3-  And<br>\
Thin skin (M, O, K) which is put as a lining to<br>\

Mgh) The portion that flows before its being<br>\
expressed, (S, Mgh,) of the juice of the grape;<br>\
(S;) and this is the most excellent of wine:<br>\

the portion that flows without its being expressed:<br>\
or the first that descends, thereof: (M:) or the<br>\
clearest, or purest, and most excellent, of wine,<br>\
such as flow from the grapes without their being<br>\
pressed, and without steeping, or maceration;<br>\
(T, TA;) and in like manner, such as flows from<br>\
dates, (T, TA,) and from raisins, before water<br>\
has been added to it (T, M, * TA) after the exuding<br>\
of the first thereof; (T, TA:) or the latter signifies the first that is expressed, of anything: (M:)<br>\
or it has this meaning also: and the former is a<br>\
name for wine [absolutely]: (S:) or each has this<br>\
meaning: (K:) or each signifies the clear, or<br>\
pure, of wine, and of anything. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سُلَافُ<br>\
العَسْكَرِ: see سَالِفٌ.<br>\

first sentence, in four places. [Hence,] الأُمَمُ<br>\
السَّالِفَةُ The peoples going before, or preceding, [or<br>\
that have gone, or passed away, before,] those<br>\
remaining, or continuing: (K, * TA:) pl. سَوَالِفُ.<br>\
(TA.) One says, كَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى الأُمَمِ السَّالِفَةِ<br>\
وَالقُرُونِ السَّوَالِفِ [That was in the time of the<br>\
preceding peoples, and the preceding generations]:<br>\
the pl. in this instance being used because every<br>\
portion of the قرون is termed سَالِفَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence also,] العَسْكَرِ سُلَّافٌ, in the K, by implication, العسكر ↓ سُلَافُ, the former word like<br>\
غُرَاب, whereas it is correctly like رُمَّان, The van<br>\

neck, (M, Mgh, TA,) from the place of suspension of the ear-ring to the حَاقِنَة [here meaning the pit of the collar-bone]: pl. سَوَالِفُ. (M.)<br>\
In the saying إِنَّهَا لَوَضَّاحَةُ السَّوَالِفِ [Verily she is<br>\
fair in respect of the سَالِفَة], mentioned by Lh,<br>\
the term سالفة is made applicable to every part<br>\
thereof, and then the pl. is used accordingly.<br>\
(M.) It is said in a trad. respecting [the covenant<br>\
at] El-Hodeybiyeh, لَأُقَاتِلَنَّهُمْ حَتَّى تَنْفَرِدَ سَالِفَتِى<br>\
i. e. [I will assuredly fight with them, or combat<br>\
