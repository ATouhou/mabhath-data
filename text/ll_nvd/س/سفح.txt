سَفَحَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
سَفَحَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. سَفْحٌ, (Msb,) [and app. سُفُوحٌ also, mentioned in what follows,] He poured out, or forth,<br>\
water: (S, A:) and he shed blood, (S, A, Msb,<br>\
K,) the blood of another; (S, A;) and tears;<br>\
(Msb, K;) inf. n. as above, and سُفُوحٌ: (K:) or<br>\
سَفَحَتِ العَيْنُ دَمْعَهَا [the eye shed its tears]. (A.)<br>\
The saying, in a trad., فَقَتَلَ عَلَىرَأْسِ المَآءِ حَتَّى<br>\
سَفَحَ الدَّمُ المَآءَ has been explained as meaning [And<br>\
he slew at the head of the water so that] the blood<br>\
covered the water: but IAth says that this is not<br>\
consistent with the language; for سَفْحٌ signifies<br>\
the act of “ pouring out, or forth; ” and that the<br>\
meaning may therefore be, that the blood made<br>\
the water to pour forth; like as when, into a<br>\
full vessel, something heavier than what is in it<br>\
is poured; for in this case there comes forth from<br>\
it as much as has been poured into it. (TA.) ―<br>\
