load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'سخبرسَخْبَرٌ A certain kind of trees, (S, K,) the heads<br>\
of which, when it grows tall, bend and hang<br>\
down; [a coll. gen. n.;] n. un. with ة: (TA:) it<br>\
resembles the إِذْخِر; (K;) or it is like the ثُمَام [or<br>\
panic grass], and has a [root such as is termed]<br>\
جُرْثُومَة; its branches, or twigs, are, in abundance,<br>\
like the كراث [app. كَرَاث, a certain large tree,<br>\
growing on the mountains]; and its fruits resemble brooms of reeds, or are more slender:<br>\
(AHn:) serpents make their abodes at its roots.<br>\
(TA.) It is related in a trad. of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr,<br>\
that he said to Mo&#39;áwiyeh, لَا تُطْرِقْ إِطْرَاقَ الأُفْعُوَانِ<br>\
فِى أُصُولِ السَّخْبَرِ [Do not thou look down upon<br>\
the ground like as does the male viper at the roots<br>\
of the sakhbar]; meaning (assumed tropical:)  do not thou affect<br>\
heedlessness of the state in which we are, or of the<br>\
affair in which we are engaged. (TA.) One<br>\
says also, رَكِبَ فُلَانٌ السَّخْبَرَ, meaning, (assumed tropical:)  Such a<br>\
one acted perfidiously, treacherously, or unfaithfully. (S.) And a poet says,<br>\
وَالغَدْرُ يَنْبُتُ فِى أُصُولِ السَّخْبَرِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [And perfidy grows at the roots of the sakhbar]:<br>\
(S:) [because the viper lives there: or] the poet<br>\
means, that the people of whom he speaks dwelt<br>\
in places where the sakhbar grew; and they are<br>\
thought to have been of the tribe of Hudheyl:<br>\
IB says that he likens the perfidious to this tree<br>\
because, when it is full-grown, its head hangs<br>\
down, not remaining erect; and that he means,<br>\
ye do not remain faithful, like as this tree does<br>\
not remain in one state. (TA.)<br>\
