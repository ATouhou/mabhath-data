like the sing.: (IAar, K:) one says أَثْوَابٌ سَنَدٌ<br>\

from a trad.:) Ibn-Buzurj says that السَّنَدُ means<br>\
الأَسْنَادُ مِنَ الثِّيَابِ, i. e. garments of those called<br>\
بُرُود: and he cites, from a poet, the phrase جُبَّةُ<br>\

manner, short shirts made of pieces of cloth, one<br>\

by whom it has been transmitted, up to the Prophet; (T, L, KT;) [or by the mention of him who<br>\
has related it from the Prophet when only one<br>\
has intervened;] opposed to مُرْسَلٌ and مُنْقِطِعٌ;<br>\
(T, L;) or it may be منقطع, i. e. interrupted in<br>\

with analogy, (TA,) and مَسَانِيدُ, (Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee,<br>\

a dial. var.; and accord. to some, agreeable with<br>\
analogy. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And i. q. دَعِىٌّ [as meaning<br>\

صَالِحٌ, [for ex.,] عبد اللّٰه is a سند, and رجل صالح<br>\
is a مسند اليه: (O, L:) [but accord. to other<br>\
authors, and general modern usage, and agreeably with the proper meanings of the terms,<br>\
المُسْنَدُ (meaning the attributed) signifies the attribute, or predicate; and المُسْنَدُ إِلَيْهِ, (meaning<br>\
that to which a thing or an accident is attributed)<br>\

Himyeritic, character of writing; the character<br>\
of Himyer; (S, M, A, O, K;) differing from<br>\
the modern Arabic character: (S, O:) they used<br>\

and AHát says that it continued in use among<br>\
them in El-Yemen in his day [i. e. in the latter<br>\
half of the second century of the Flight and the<br>\
former half of the third century]: (M, TA:)<br>\
Abu-l-&#39;Abbás says, المُسْنَدُ was the language of<br>\
the sons of Seth; (O, TA;) [i. e. the language<br>\

end; &amp;c.]. (S, M, A, K.) So in the saying,<br>\
لَا أَفْعَلُهُ آخِرَ المُسْنَدِ [I will not do it to the end<br>\
of time]. (A, TA.) One says also, لَا آتِيهِ يَدَ<br>\
المُسْنَدِ, meaning [I will not do it, or I will not<br>\
come to him or it,] ever. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
مَسْنَدٌ: see سَنَدٌ, second sentence.<br>\

خُشُبٌ مُسَنَّدَةٌ, [in the Kur lxiii. 4, meaning Pieces<br>\

مُسَنَّدَةٌ also signifies A certain sort of cloths, or<br>\

withers: (Ibn-Buzurj, L:) or strong in the back:<br>\
or whose frame, or make, is symmetrical, or conformable in its several parts: or, as some say,<br>\
whose frame, or make, is dissimilar, or unconformable, in its several parts; because the hump<br>\
differs from the other parts; so that it is from the<br>\
phrase تَسَانَدَ القَوْمُ meaning as expl. above [see 6]:<br>\
(Ham p. 783:) and مُسَانَدَةُ القَرَا (tropical:)  a she-camel<br>\
