سَمْتٌ [as an inf. n.] is syn. with قَصْدٌ [in an<br>\
intrans. sense], (S, * Msb,) and هُدًى [in the sense<br>\
of رَشَادٌ], and اِسْتِقَامَةٌ: (Msb:) or حُسْنُ نَحْوٍ:<br>\
(M, K:) you say, سَمَتَ, aor.<br>\
سَمُتَ, (S, M, K,)<br>\
and<br>\
سَمِتَ, (K,) or in this case the former only,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. سَمْتٌ, (M, TA,) He pursued a<br>\
right course; syn. قَصَدَ: (S, TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  he followed a good direction (M, K, * TA *) in the way<br>\
of religion [&amp;c.]. (TA.) Accord. to Khálid Ibn-<br>\
Dabbeh, it signifies (assumed tropical:)  The following the truth and<br>\
the right way or direction, and being a good<br>\
neighbour, and doing little harm. (TA.) [But<br>\
more commonly, or primarily, it relates to the<br>\
course that one pursues in journeying.] An Arab<br>\
of the desert, of [the tribe of] Keys, says,<br>\
سَوْفَ تَجُوبِينَ بِغَيْرِ نَعْتِ<br>\
تَعَسُّفًا أَوْ هٰكَذَا بِالسَّمْتِ<br>\
i. e. [Thou shalt traverse (addressing a woman),<br>\
or, more probably, ye shall traverse (addressing<br>\
camels or other beasts), a land without a description], journeying without any sign of the way<br>\
and without any track [for guidance], such<br>\
being the meaning of تعسّفا, or thus, pursuing a<br>\
right course, السَّمْتُ meaning القَصْدُ. (TA.)<br>\
Accord. to Sh, السَّمْتُ signifies The seeking,<br>\
searching, or inquiring, for, or after, the right<br>\
way or direction. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  السَّمْتُ also signifies<br>\
قَصدُ الطَّرِيقِ [i. e. سَمْتُ الطَّرِيقِ signifies The<br>\
road&#39;s having a right, or direct, tendency]: (M:)<br>\
or [سَمْتُ الشَّىْءِ] signifies قَصْدُ الشَّىْءِ [i. e. The<br>\
thing&#39;s having a right, or direct, tendency]. (K.)<br>\
[This last explanation has been misunderstood by<br>\
the Turkish translator of the K; who has hence<br>\
been led to assert that one says, سَمَتَ الشَّىْءَ as<br>\
well as سَمَتَ نَحْوَهُ, meaning قَصَدَهُ: it is تَسَمَّتَهُ<br>\
that (like سَمَتَ نَحْوَهُ) signifies قَصَدَهُ; not<br>\
سَمَتَهُ, for سَمَتَ is always intrans.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The<br>\
journeying (S, M, K) upon the road (M, K)<br>\
[guided only] by opinion (S, M, K) and conjecture: (S:) or, as some say, the journeying by<br>\
conjecture and opinion, not upon a [known] road.<br>\
(TA.) A poet says,<br>\
↓ لَيْسَ بِهَا رِيعٌ لِسَمْتِ السَّامِتِ<br>\
[There is not, or was not, in it, a road of any<br>\
kind (see رِيعٌ) for the journeying by opinion and<br>\
conjecture of him who so journeys]. (S, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And The pursuing a course, or direction, [of<br>\
any kind,] and [particularly] (assumed tropical:)  in religion and in<br>\
worldly affairs. (TA.) You say, هُوَ يَسْمُتُ سَمْتَهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He pursues his [another&#39;s] way, or course, doing<br>\
as he [the latter] does. (TA.) [سَمْتَهُ is here an<br>\
absolute (not an objective) complement of يَسْمُتُ;<br>\
like سَيْرَهُ in the phrase هُوَيَسِيرُ سَيْرَهُ. See also<br>\
سَمْتٌ below.] ―<br>\
-b5-  Also سَمَتَ, aor.<br>\
سَمُتَ, inf. n. سَمْتٌ,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He (a man) was, or became, grave, staid,<br>\
steady, sedate, or calm. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And سَمَتَ لَهُمْ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
سَمِتَ, (Fr, K,) inf. n. سَمْتٌ, (Fr, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
prepared, arranged, or disposed, for them, the<br>\
mode, or manner, of speech, and of judging, or<br>\
forming an opinion, (Fr, K, TA,) and of work,<br>\
or action. (Fr, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
تَسْمِيتٌ The keeping to the سَمْت [i. e. road,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (K.) It is said in a trad., فَانْطَلَقْتُ لَا أَدْرِى<br>\
أَيْنَ أَذْهَبُ إِلَّا أَنَّنِى أُسَمِّتُ, meaning [And I departed, not knowing whither I should go, but] I<br>\
kept to the course, or direction, of the road: or<br>\
as some say, I prayed to God. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The mentioning of God, (S, M, A, Msb, K,)<br>\
or, as in some copies of the S, the mentioning of<br>\
the name of God, [like تَسْمِيَةٌ, inf. n. of سَمَّى,]<br>\
(TA,) upon, or over, a thing, (S, M, A, Msb, K,)<br>\
or in any case. (TA.) One says, سَمَّتَ عَلَى<br>\
الطَّعَامِ (assumed tropical:)  He mentioned the name of God upon,<br>\
or over, the food. (TK.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And سمّت لَهُ and<br>\
عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. تَسْمِيتٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He prayed for what was<br>\
good for him; prayed for a blessing upon him;<br>\
as also شمّت. (L and TA in art. شمت, q. v.)<br>\
In a trad. respecting eating, it is said, سَمُّوا اللّٰهَ<br>\
وَدَنُّوا وَسَمِّتُوا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Pronounce ye the name<br>\
of God, and take what is next you of the food,<br>\
or make your words to be near together, (see 2<br>\
in arts. دنو and سمو,) and,] when ye have ended,<br>\
invoke a blessing upon him at whose abode or<br>\
table ye have eaten. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  التَّسْنِيتُ also<br>\
signifies, (M, K,) or تَسْمِيتُ العَاطِسِ, (S, Msb,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The praying for the sneezer; (M, Msb, K;)<br>\
saying, هَدَاكَ اللّٰهُ إِلَى السَّمْتِ [May God guide<br>\
thee to the right, or good, course]; because the<br>\
person sneezing is disturbed and disquieted: so<br>\
says AAF: (M, TA:) or the saying to him,<br>\
يَرْحَمُكَ اللّٰهُ [May God have mercy on thee]:<br>\
(Th, S, M:) or التَّسْمِيتُ signifies the saying بَارَكَ<br>\
اللّٰهُ فِيكَ [May God bless thee]: (ISh, TA:) it is<br>\
with س and with ش: (S, M, Msb:) one says<br>\
سَمَّتَهُ, (T, M, Msb,) i. e. سَمَّتَ العَاطِسَ, meaning<br>\
He prayed for the sneezer, [saying as above,]<br>\
(A,) and شَمَّتَهُ: (T, M, Msb:) Th says that the<br>\
former is preferred, (S,) or is the original, (Msb,)<br>\
being from السَّمْتُ signifying القَصْدُ, (S, M, Msb,)<br>\
and الهُدَى, and الاِسْتِقَامَةُ, (Msb,) and المَحَجَّةُ,<br>\
(S,) or الطَّرِيقُ; (M;) as though one made a<br>\
person his object by this prayer; (M;) and that<br>\
the س is changed [by some] into ش: (TA:) but<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd says that the pronunciation with ش is<br>\
of higher authority, and more common. (S,<br>\
Msb.) The Prophet said, When any of you<br>\
sneezes, let him say, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ [Praise be to<br>\
God]; and he who prays for him (الَّذِى يُشَنِّتُهُ<br>\
[or يُسَمِّتُهُ]), يَرْحَمُكَ اللّٰهُ; and let him [i. e. the<br>\
sneezer] say [in reply], يَهْدِيكُمُ اللّٰهُ وَيُصْلِحُ بَالَكُمْ<br>\
[May God direct you aright, and render good<br>\
your state, or condition, or case]. (Har p. 250.)<br>\
3<br>\
سامتهُ, inf. n. مُسَامَتَةٌ, He, or it, faced, or<br>\
fronted, or was opposite to or over against, him,<br>\

5<br>\
تسمّتهُ, (As, S, A, TA,) [and] تسمّت لَهُ,<br>\
(M,) He directed himself, or his course, or aim,<br>\
to, or towards, him, or it; syn. قَصَدَهُ, (S, M,) or<br>\
تَعَمَّدَهُ, and قَصَدَ نَحْوَهُ. (As, A, TA.)<br>\

-b3-  And [hence,] (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
way, or course, that one pursues in his religion<br>\
and his worldly affairs: (TA:) (assumed tropical:)  a way, mode,<br>\
or manner, of acting or conduct or the like: (S,<br>\

(S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,) of good people, (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, K, TA,) in respect of religion, not in<br>\
respect of goodliness of person: (TA:) a metaphorical meaning, from the same word as signifying “ a road,” or “ way. ” (Mgh.) One says,<br>\
إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ السَّمْتِ (assumed tropical:)  Verily he is good in respect of<br>\
the way, or course, that he pursues in his religion<br>\
and his worldly affairs: (TA:) or هُوَحَسَنُ<br>\

manner, of acting or conduct or the like! (S, A, *<br>\
Mgh, * TA.) ―<br>\

directed. (M.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [And hence, The bearing, or<br>\

particularly, The azimuth. ―<br>\
-b7-  And سَمْتُ الرَّأْسِ<br>\
The zenith; or vertical point in the heavens.<br>\

―<br>\
-b8-  سَمْتُ الشَّمْسِ The path of the sun; the<br>\
ecliptic: from سَمْتٌ signifying “ a road,” or<br>\
