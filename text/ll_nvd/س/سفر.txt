or took away, or carried off, in every direction:<br>\
and] dispersed: (M, K:) and removed, took off,<br>\
or stripped off, a thing from a thing which it<br>\
covered. (M * A, * K.) You say, سَفَرَتِ الرِّيحُ<br>\
التُّرَابَ, and الوَرَقَ, (assumed tropical:)  The wind swept away the<br>\
dust, and the leaves: or too them away, or<br>\
carried them off, in every direction. (M.) And<br>\
سَفَرَت ِ الرِّيحُ الغَيْمَ (assumed tropical:)  The wind dispersed the<br>\

سَفِرَ,<br>\
(M,) inf. n. سُفُورٌ, (M, Mgh,) meaning She removed her veil (M, A, Mgh) عَنْ وَجْهِهَا from her<br>\

سَفِرَ, inf. n. سَفْرٌ<br>\
[or سُفُورٌ?], signifies I uncovered the thing; made it<br>\
apparent, or manifest: (Mgh:) [but accord. to Mtr,]<br>\
the phrase تَسْفِرُ وَجْهَهَا [meaning she uncovers her<br>\
face] is of weak authority. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence,<br>\
i. e. from سَفَرَتْ meaning “ she uncovered her<br>\
face,” (M,) سَفَرْتُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ, (S, M, Mgh, * Msb,<br>\

former of which inf. ns. perhaps indicates a radical<br>\
relation to سَفَرَتْ said of a woman, and of the<br>\
sun, expl. above,] He went forth to journey:<br>\
(S, Msb:) this verb, however, in this sense,<br>\
[which appears to have been unknown, or not<br>\
acknowledged, by the authors of the M and K,<br>\
(see مُسَافِرٌ,)] is obsolete; but its inf. n. سَفَرٌ is<br>\
used as a simple subst. (Msb. [See 3, the verb<br>\

اسفرت الشَّجَرَةُ The tree had its leaves blown<br>\
off [and swept away] by the wind; (K, * TA;)<br>\
they having become changed in colour, and white.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And اسفر, (inf. n. إِسْفَارٌ, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
It (the dawn, or daybreak,) shone, (T, S, M, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) so that there was no doubt respecting it; (T, TA;) as also ↓ سَفَرَ, (M, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\

of daybreak when ye enter upon the time in which<br>\
the dawn shines, or becomes white: (S, * Msb:) or<br>\
when the dawn has become manifest, so that there<br>\
is no doubt respecting it, every one knowing it to<br>\
be the true dawn when he sees it; accord. to EshSháfi&#39;ee and Ibn-Hambal and others: (T, TA:) or<br>\
prolong ye the prayer of daybreak until ye enter<br>\
upon the time when the dawn becomes white: (S,<br>\
TA:) some say that it relates especially to nights<br>\
in [the end of] which the moon shines, because in<br>\
such the commencement of daybreak is not<br>\
manifest: (TA:) or أَسْفَرَ بِالصَّلَاةِ means he performed prayer in the shining of the dawn: and<br>\
the ب is for the purpose of making the verb<br>\
transitive. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b6-  اسفرت الحَرْبُ (tropical:)  The war<br>\
became vehement. (A, K.)<br>\

had upon him. (O, K, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  تسفّر الجِلْدُ The<br>\

or large, book: or a section of the Book of the<br>\
Law revealed to Moses: (M, K:) or a book that<br>\

-b2-  With<br>\
respect to the saying of Aboo-Sakhr El-Hudhalee,<br>\

وَأُخْرَى بِذَاتِ الجَيْشِ آيَاتُهَاسِفْرُ<br>\
Skr says, [the poet means,] the marks, or traces,<br>\
thereof had become effaced: [accordingly, the<br>\
verse may be rendered, To Leylà there was in<br>\
Dhát-el-Beyn an abode that I knew, and another<br>\
in Dhát-el-Jeysh whereof the marks, or traces,<br>\
are effaced:] IJ says, [app. holding the meaning<br>\
to be, the marks, or traces, whereof are (like<br>\
those of) an ancient book, such as a portion of<br>\
the Mosaic Law,] the last word should be from<br>\
the phrase سَفَرْتُ البَيْتَ, i. e. “ I swept the house,<br>\
or chamber; ” as though the writing were swept<br>\
off from the طِرْس [or “ written paper ” or the<br>\
like, to which the poet seems to compare the site<br>\
of the abode in Dhát-el-Jeysh]. (M, TA.)<br>\
سَفَرٌ Journey, or travel; the act of journeying<br>\
or travelling; (S, A, K;) contr. of حَضَرٌ: (M,<br>\
K:) thus called because of the going and coming<br>\
in it, like the going and coming of the wind<br>\
sweeping away fallen leaves: (M:) or the act of<br>\
going forth to journey; an inf. n. used as a simple<br>\
subst.: (Msb:) [therefore] the pl. is أسْفَارٌ: (S,<br>\
M, A, Msb, K:) [and therefore it is often used<br>\
as a n. un.; but, properly speaking, the n. un. is<br>\
↓ سَفْرَةٌ:] you say, كَانَتْ سَفْرَتُهُ قَرِيبَةً [His journey<br>\
was near]: and the pl. of سَفْرَةٌ, accord. to rule,<br>\
is سَفَرَاتٌ. (Msb.) In law, [as relating to the<br>\
obligation of fasting &amp;c.,] The going forth with<br>\
the intention of performing a journey of three<br>\
days and nights, or more. (KT.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The<br>\
whiteness of dawn or daybreak: (A:) or the<br>\
whiteness of the day: (S, M:) and i. q. صَبَاحٌ<br>\
[dawn, or morning, or forenoon; but app. here<br>\
used in the first of these senses]: (M:) and<br>\
↓ سَفِيرٌ, the whiteness [of the sky] before night:<br>\
(A, TA:) or the former, the remains of the<br>\
whiteness of day after sunset. (K.) You say<br>\
سَفَرًا i. e. صَبَاحًا [app. as meaning In the dawn].<br>\
(A.) And the prose-rhymer says, إِذَا طَلَعَتِ<br>\
الشِّعْرَى سَفَرًا لَمْ تَرَفِيهَا مَطَرًا (S, * TA) i. e. When<br>\
Sirius rises in the whiteness of day [meaning in<br>\
the clear twilight of morning, thou seest not then<br>\
rain: for Sirius rises aurorally, in Arabia, in the<br>\
middle and the latter half of July, when rain<br>\
scarcely ever falls there]. (S. [Accord. to the<br>\
TA, the meaning, app. taken without consideration from one of the foregoing explanations of<br>\
سَفَرٌ, is, when Sirius rises at nightfall: but this<br>\
is during the usual winter-rains.]) You say also,<br>\
لَقِيتُهُ سَفَرًا, and فِى سَفَرٍ, meaning ↓ عِنْدَاسْفِرَارِ<br>\
الشَّمْسِ لِلغُرُوبِ, thus related, with س [in the<br>\
word اسفرار (not with ص), and app. meaning<br>\
I met him when the sun was becoming white,<br>\
previously to the setting]. (M.) And بَقِىَ سَفَرٌ<br>\
مِنْ نَهَارٍ [There remained a white gleam of daylight]. (A.)<br>\
سَفْرَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
سُفْرَةٌ The food of the traveller; (M, K;) the<br>\
food that is prepared for the traveller, (S, Msb,)<br>\
or for a journey: (TA:) pl. َسُفَرٌ. (Msb.) This<br>\
is the primary signification. (TA.) You say,<br>\
أَكَلُوا السُّفْرَةَ They ate the food for the journey.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (tropical:)  The receptacle thereof; (TA;)<br>\
the piece of skin in which it is put. (S, * M, *<br>\
Msb, K, * TA.) [This is commonly of a round<br>\
form, with a running string; so that it is converted into a bag to contain the food, at one<br>\
time, and at another time is spread flat upon the<br>\
ground, when persons want to eat upon it.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And hence, (tropical:)  The thing [whatever it be] upon<br>\
which one eats: (TA:) [in the desert, it is generally a round piece of skin, such as I have<br>\
described above: in the towns, in the houses of<br>\
the middle classes, a round tray of tinned copper,<br>\
which is usually placed on a low stool; and in<br>\
the dwellings of some of the highest classes, and<br>\
the lowest, respectively, of silver and wood:]<br>\
accord. to the T, سُفْرَةٌ has the last of the significations given before this, and the thing which it<br>\
denotes is thus called because it is spread when<br>\
one eats upon it. (TA.)<br>\
سِفَارٌ (Lh, S, M, K) and ↓ سِفَارَةٌ (Lh, M) A<br>\
piece of iron, (S, M, K,) or a cord, (M,) or a<br>\
piece of skin, (K,) that is put over the nose [and<br>\
jaws] of a camel, in the place of the حَكَمَة [q. v.]<br>\

that is attached to the خِطَام [q. v.] of a camel, a<br>\
part being twisted round it, and the rest being<br>\
made a rein: and sometimes it is of iron: (Lth:)<br>\
pl. [of pauc., of the former,] أَسْفِرَةٌ (M, K)<br>\
and [of mult.] سُفُرٌ (S, M, K) and [of either] سَفَائِرُ.<br>\
(M, K.)<br>\

(M;) leaves which fall from trees (S, A, K) and<br>\
which the wind sweeps away, (A,) or because the<br>\
wind sweeps them away: (S:) or leaves of herbs;<br>\
because the wind sweeps them away: (T, TA:)<br>\
or what have fallen of the leaves of trees and of<br>\
the lower portions of seed-produce. (JM.)<br>\

Also A messenger: (S:) and (assumed tropical:)  a mediator; or a<br>\
man who makes peace, effects a reconciliation, or<br>\
adjusts a difference, between a people; (S, M,<br>\
Msb;) as also ↓ سَافِرٌ: (Msb:) or a messenger<br>\
who makes peace, &amp;c.: (T, Mgh, TA:) [see 1:]<br>\
pl. of the former سُفَرَآءُ, (S, M, Mgh,) and of the<br>\
latter سَفَرَةٌ. (Har p. 255. [See also سِفَارَةٌ, below.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  A commissioned agent, a factor, or a<br>\
deputy; and the like: pl. as above: app. so<br>\
called because he discovers, and makes manifest,<br>\
the affair in which he acts as a substitute for another person. (Msb.)<br>\

سُفَارَةٌ Sweepings. (S, M, K.)<br>\
سِفَارَةٌ an inf. n. of سَفَرَ in the phrase سَفَرَ بَيْنَ<br>\
