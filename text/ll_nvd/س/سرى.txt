سَرَى, (S, M, K,) or سَرَى اللَّيْلَ (Msb) and<br>\
بِاللَّيْلِ, (Mgh, Msb,) aor. يَسْرِى, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
سُرًى (S, M, Mgh, K) and مَسْرًى (S, K) and<br>\
سَرْيَةٌ and سُرْيَةٌ (M, K) and سِرَايَةٌ; (S, * and TA<br>\
as from the K, but not in the CK nor in my MS.<br>\
copy of the K;) the first of a form rare among<br>\
inf. ns., because it is one of the forms of pls., as<br>\
is shown by the fact that some of the Arabs make<br>\
it and هُدًى fem., namely, Benoo-Asad, supposing them to be pls. of سُرْيَةٌ and هُدْيَةٌ, (S,) and<br>\
Lh knew not سُرًى but as a fem. noun; (M;) or<br>\
the inf. n. is سَرْىٌ, and سُرْيَةٌ and سَرْيَةٌ are more<br>\
special [in meaning, as will be shown below, voce<br>\
سَرْيَةٌ], and سُرًى is pl. of سُرْيَةٌ; (Msb;) or سَرْيَةٌ<br>\
is an inf. n. un., and سُرْيَةٌ is a simple subst., and<br>\
so is سُرًى, (S, TA,) and so is سِرَايَةٌ (Msb, TA)<br>\
also, as some say; (TA;) He journeyed, or<br>\
travelled, by night, or in the night, (S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) in a general sense; (M, K;) accord. to<br>\
AZ, in the first part part of the night, and in the<br>\
middle thereof, and in the last part thereof;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) and ↓ اسرى signifies the same (S,<br>\
M, Mgh, Msb, K) in the dial. of El-Hijáz, (S,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. إِسْرَآءٌ; (M;) as also ↓ استرى; (M,<br>\
K;) and perhaps ↓ تسرّى likewise. (Mgh.) [See<br>\
also سُرًى and سَرْيَةٌ below.] It is said in a prov.,<br>\
قُنْفُذٍ ↓ ذَهَبُوا إِسْرَآءَ [They went away in the manner<br>\
of a hedge-hog&#39;s night-travelling; meaning they<br>\
went away by night]; because the قنفذ goes all<br>\
the night, not sleeping. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, as<br>\
denoting unseen progress,] it is said also of the<br>\
root of a tree, meaning It crept along beneath<br>\
the ground; (Az, M, K;) aor. as above, (M,)<br>\
inf. n. سَرْىٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And it is said of ideal<br>\
things, as being likened to corporeal things;<br>\
tropically, and by extension of the signification;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) or metaphorically; [as, for instance,]<br>\
of calamities, and wars, and anxieties: (M, TA:)<br>\
and the predominant inf. ns. [in these cases] are<br>\
سِرَايَةٌ and سَرَيَانٌ. (TA.) One says, سَرَى عِرْقُ<br>\
السُّوْءِ فِى الإِنْسَانِ (tropical:)  [The root, or strain, of evil<br>\
crept in the man]. (Es-Sarakustee, Msb, TA.)<br>\
And سَرَى فِيهِ السَّمُّ (tropical:)  [The poison crept in him, or<br>\
pervaded him]; and similarly one says of wine;<br>\
and of the like of these two things. (El-Fárábee,<br>\
Msb, TA. [See also دَبَّ.]) And the lawyers say,<br>\
سَرَى الجُرْحُ إِلَى النَّفْسِ (tropical:)  [The wound extended to<br>\
the soul], meaning that the pain of the wound<br>\
continued until death ensued in consequence<br>\
thereof: (Mgh, * Msb, TA:) and قُطِعَ كَفُّهُ فَسَرَى<br>\
إِلَى سَاعِدِهِ (tropical:)  [His hand was cut off, and it extended to his upper arm], meaning that the effect<br>\
of the wound passed by transmission: and سَرَى<br>\
التَّحْرِيمُ, and العِتْقُ, (tropical:)  The prohibition, and the<br>\
emancipation, [extended, or] passed by transmission: phrases current among the lawyers, but not<br>\
mentioned in books of repute, though agreeable<br>\
with others here preceding and following. (Msb,<br>\
TA.) One says also, سَرَى عَلَيْهِ الهَمُّ (tropical:)  Anxiety<br>\
came to him [or upon him] by night: and سَرَى<br>\
هَمُّهُ (tropical:)  His anxiety went away. (Msb, TA.) And<br>\
similar to these is the phrase in the Kur [lxxxix.<br>\
3], وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَسْرِ (tropical:)  And by the night when it<br>\
goes away: (Msb, TA:) or, as some say, when<br>\
one journeys in it; like as one says لَيْلٌ نَائِمٌ<br>\
meaning “ night in which one sleeps: ” the [final]<br>\
ى [of the verb] is elided because it terminates a<br>\
verse. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It is made trans. by means of<br>\
ب: (Msb:) one says, سَرَى بِهِ [He made him to<br>\
journey, or travel, or he transported him, by<br>\
night, or in the night; or it may be rendered he<br>\
journeyed, or travelled, with him, by night, or in<br>\
the night]; (M, Msb, K;) and in like manner,<br>\
[and more commonly,] بِهِ ↓ أَسْرَى; (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K;) and ↓ أَسْرَاهُ; (S, M, K;) like as one says,<br>\
أَخَذَ بِالخِطَامِ as well as اخذ الخِطَامَ. (S.) As to<br>\
the saying in the Kur [xvii. 1], سُبْحَانَ الَّذِى<br>\
بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا ↓ أَسْرَى [Extolled be the glory of Him<br>\
who transported his servant by night!], it is an<br>\
instance of corroboration, (S, K, * TA,) like the<br>\
saying, سِرْتُ أَمْسِ نَهَارًا and البَارِحَةَ لَيْلًا: (S, TA:)<br>\
or the meaning is [simply] سَيَّرَهُ: (K, TA:) accord. to &#39;Alam-ed-Deen Es-Sakháwee, لَيْلًا is<br>\
added, although الإِسْرَآء is not otherwise than by<br>\
night, because the space over which he was<br>\
transported is not to be traversed in less than<br>\
forty days, but was traversed by him in one<br>\
night; as though the meaning [intended] were,<br>\
فِى لَيْلٍ وَاحِدٍ; and it denotes wonder: لَيْلًا is here<br>\
used instead of لَيْلَةً because when they say سَرَى<br>\
لَيْلَةً the meaning generally is he occupied the<br>\
whole of the night in journeying: Er-Rághib<br>\
holds the verb in this instance to be from سَرَاةٌ<br>\
signifying “ a wide tract of land,” to belong to<br>\
art. سرو, and to be like أَجْبَلَ and أَتْهَمَ; the meaning being, who transported his servant over a<br>\
wide tract of land: but this is strange. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
سَرَى مَتَاعَهُ, (M, K,) aor. يَسْرِى, (M, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
سَرْىٌ, (TA,) He threw his goods, or utensils and<br>\
furniture, upon the back of his beast. (M, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And سَرَى عَنِّى الثَّوْبَ, inf. n. سَرْىٌ, He removed from over me the garment: but و is more<br>\
approved [as the final radical: see 1 in art, سرو].<br>\
(M, TA.) You say, سَرَيْتُ الثَّوْبَ and ↓ سَرَّيْتُهُ I<br>\
pulled off the garment: and عَنْهُ ↓ سُرِّىَ It was<br>\
removed from over him, and removed from its<br>\
place: the teshdeed denotes intensiveness. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
سرّى, (K,) or سرّى سَرِيَّةً, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
تَسْرِيَةٌ, He (the leader of an army, TA) detached a<br>\
سَرِيَّة [q. v.] (K, TA) to the enemy by night. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
سرّى العَرَقَ عَنْ بَدَنِهِ, inf. n. as above, He exuded<br>\
the sweat from his body. (TA.) ―<br>\

سُرًى, [said by some to be an inf. n., by some<br>\
to be a simple subst., and by some to be pl. of<br>\
سُرْيَةٌ, or supposed to be so, and therefore made<br>\
fem., as mentioned in the first sentence of this<br>\
art.,] meaning A journeying, or travelling, by<br>\
night, or in the night, in a general sense, is masc.<br>\
and fem., (M, K,) by some of the Arabs made<br>\
fem., (S,) and not known to Lh but as a fem.<br>\
noun. (M.) It is said in a prov.,<br>\
عِنْدَ الصَّبَاحِ يَحْمَدُ القَوْمُ السُّرَى<br>\
[At daybreak, the party commend night-journeying]: applied to the man who endures difficulty,<br>\
or distress, or fatigue, hoping for rest, or ease:<br>\
(Meyd:) and in inciting to labour for the accomplishment of an affair with patience, and to dispose<br>\
and subject the mind, until one commends the result thereof. (Har p. 555, q. v.)<br>\
سَرَاةٌ: see art. سرو.<br>\
سَرْيَةٌ and ↓ سُرْيَةٌ are inf. ns. of سَرَى: (M, K:)<br>\
or have a more special signification than the<br>\
inf. n. of that verb, which is سَرْىٌ: one says,<br>\
سَرَيْنَا سَرْيَةً مِنَ اللَّيْلِ and ↓ سُرْيَةً [We journeyed<br>\
by night a journey of the night]: and the pl. of<br>\
↓ سُرْيَةٌ is [said to be] سُرًى: (Msb:) or one says,<br>\
سَرَيْنَا سَرْيَةً وَاحِدَةً [We journeyed by night a<br>\
single night-journey]: and the subst. [signifying<br>\
a journeying, or travelling, by night, or in the<br>\
night,] is ↓ سُرْيَةٌ, and سُرًى. (S, TA.)<br>\
سُرْيَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
four places.<br>\
سِرْيَةٌ meaning An arrow-head, (As, M, TA,)<br>\
such as is small, short, round and smooth, having<br>\
no breadth, (M, TA,) is a dial. var. of سِرْوَةٌ<br>\
[q. v.], (As, TA,) or formed from the latter word<br>\
by the substitution of ى for و because of the<br>\
kesreh: (M, TA:) accord. to the K, ↓ سَرِيَّةٌ<br>\
signifies a small round arrow-head; but this is a<br>\
mistake; the correct word being سِرْيَةٌ, with kesr,<br>\
and without teshdeed to the ى. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  It is<br>\
also a dial. var. of سِرْوَةٌ signifying The locust in<br>\
its first state, when it is a larva. (S in art. سرو.)<br>\
سَرَآءٌ A certain tree, (AHn, S, M, K,) from<br>\
which bows are made, (AHn, S, M,) the wood<br>\
whereof is of the best of woods, and which is of<br>\
the trees of the mountains: (AHn, M:) ElGhanawee El-Aarábee says, the نَبْع and شَوْحَط<br>\
[q. v.] and سَرَآء are one: (TA in art. شحط:) [it<br>\
is also mentioned in the TA in art. سرأ:] n. un.<br>\
سَرَآءَةٌ. (M, K.)<br>\
سَرِىٌّ i. q. نَهْرٌ [A river, &amp;c.]: (Th, M:) or a<br>\
rivulet, or streamlet: (S, M, Msb:) or a rivulet<br>\
running to palm-trees: (M, K:) pl. [of pauc.]<br>\
أَسْرِيَةٌ (S, M, K) and [of mult.] سُرْيَانٌ: (Sb, S,<br>\
M, Msb, K:) أَسْرِيَآءُ as its pl. has not been heard.<br>\
(S.) Thus it has been expl. as occurring in the<br>\
Kur xix. 24. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also art. سرو.<br>\
سَرِيَّةٌ A portion of an army: (S, Msb:) of the<br>\
measure فَعِيلَةٌ in the sense of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ;<br>\
because marching by night, privily; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) thus originally, and afterwards applied<br>\
also to such as march by day: (Ham p. 45:) or<br>\
it may be from الاِسْتِرَآءُ “ the act of choosing, or<br>\
selecting; ” because a company chosen from the<br>\
army: (Mgh: [but if so, belonging to art. سرو:])<br>\
from five persons to three hundred: (M, K:) or<br>\
four hundred: (K:) or, of horsemen, about four<br>\
hundred: (M:) or the best thereof, (S,) or the<br>\
utmost, (Nh,) consists of four hundred: (S,<br>\
Nh:) or, accord. to the “ Fet-h el-Bári,” from<br>\
a hundred to five hundred: (TA:) or nine, and<br>\
more than this; three, and four, and the like<br>\
being termed طَلِيعَةٌ, not سَرِيَّةٌ: but it is related of<br>\
the Prophet that he sent a single person as a<br>\
سَرِيَّة: (Mgh:) the pl. is سَرَايَا (S, Msb) and<br>\
سَرِيَّاتٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  See also سِرْيَةٌ.<br>\
سِرَايَةٌ A journeying, or travelling, by night, or<br>\

occurring in philosophical works, and probably<br>\
post-classical.]<br>\

night. (K.)<br>\
سَارٍ Journeying, or travelling, by night, or in<br>\

that comes by night: (S, Msb:) or clouds that<br>\
travel by night: (K:) or a cloud that is between<br>\
that which comes in the early morning and that<br>\
which comes in the evening: [perhaps thus termed<br>\
as having previously travelled in the night:] or,<br>\
accord. to Lh, a rain that comes in the night:<br>\
(M, TA:) pl. سَوَارِى [app. a mistranscription for<br>\
سَوَارٍ, being indeterminate]. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  One<br>\
says, جَآءَ صَبِيحَةَ سَارِيَةٍ He came in the morning<br>\
of a night in which was rain. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
the pl. السَّارِيَاتُ signifies The asses: (M:) or the<br>\
wild asses: (TA:) because they rest not by<br>\
night: (M:) or because they pasture by night.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
