سَمُحَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
سَمَاحٌ and سَمَاحَةٌ and سُمُوحٌ and سُمُوحَةٌ and سَمْحٌ<br>\
and سِمَاحٌ, (K,) He was, or became, liberal,<br>\
bountiful, munificent, or generous; (S, * Msb, *<br>\
K;) as also ↓ اسمح: (Msb, K:) but the unaugmented verb commonly known, but faultily<br>\
omitted in the K, is سَمَحَ, aor.<br>\
سَمَحَ; and this is the<br>\
only one mentioned by IKtt and IKoot and a<br>\
number of other authors: سَمُحَ, like كَرُمَ, means<br>\
he became of the people of السَّمَاحَة [i. e. liberality,<br>\
&amp;c.]: (MF:) [but] سَمَحَ and ↓ اسمح both signify as above; he was, or became, liberal, &amp;c.;<br>\
and he gave from a motive of generosity and<br>\
liberality: this is the correct explanation of both;<br>\
though some say that the former only is used in<br>\
this sense; and the latter, in relation to compliance and submissiveness. (L.) You say, سَمَحَ بِهِ,<br>\
(S, A, Msb,) aor.<br>\
سَمَحَ, inf. n. سَمَاحٌ and سَمَاحَةٌ (S, *<br>\

with that which was desired of him; as also<br>\
↓ اسمح. (Msb.) [And سَمَحَ لَهُ He was liberal,<br>\
&amp;c., to him; as also ↓ اسمح; whence,] God is<br>\
represented, in a trad., as saying, لِعَبْدِى ↓ أَسْمِحُوا<br>\
كَإِسْمَاحِهِ إِلَى عِبَادِى Be ye liberal, &amp;c., to my<br>\
servant, [meaning Mohammad,] like as he is<br>\
liberal, &amp;c., to my servants. (L.) And سَمَحَ لِى,<br>\
(S,) or لَهُ, (A,) He gave (S, A) to me, (S,) or to<br>\
him: (A:) and بِكَذَا ↓ سَامَحَهُ he gave him such<br>\
a thing. (Msb.) And سَمَحَ لِى بِذٰلِكَ, and<br>\
↓ اسمح, and ↓ سامح, He complied with my desire in<br>\
that thing. (L: see also a similar phrase below.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
سَمَحَتْ, said of a she-camel, means She became<br>\
submissive, and went quickly: (L:) and ↓ اسمحت<br>\
said of a beast (دَابَّة), it became gentle and submissive after being refractory: (L, K: *) and in<br>\
like manner ↓ اسمح; (A;) and ↓ سمّح, inf. n.<br>\
تَسْمِيحٌ; (L;) said of a camel: (A, L:) or<br>\
تَسْمِيحٌ signifies the going an easy pace: (S, L,<br>\
K:) and the going quickly: (L, K:) or (so in<br>\
the L, but in the K “ and ”) the act of fleeing.<br>\
(L, K.) And ↓ اسمح It became easy and submissive. (L.) You say, قَرُونَتُهُ ↓ أَسْمَحَتْ, (S, A,<br>\
K,) and قَرِينَتُهُ, as also ↓ سَامَحَتْ, (L,) His mind<br>\
became submissive, (S, A, L, K,) لِذٰلِكَ الأَمْرِ to<br>\
that thing. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  سَمَحَ, inf. n. سَمَاحٌ; (L;)<br>\
and ↓ سمّح, (Mgh, L,) inf. n. تَسْمِيحٌ; (L, K;)<br>\
and ↓ سامح, (Mgh, L,) inf. n. مُسَامَحَةٌ; (S, A,<br>\
L, K;) and ↓ اسمح, (Mgh,) and ↓ تسمّح; (L;) also<br>\
signify He acted in an easy, or a gentle, manner;<br>\
(S, A, Mgh, L, K;) and he made easy, or facilitated; (L;) فِى أَمْرٍ in an affair: (Mgh, L:) and<br>\
↓ مُسَامَحَةٌ signifies the acting in an easy, or a<br>\
gentle, manner in a contest in thrusting, or piercing,<br>\
with spears or the like, and smiting with swords,<br>\
and running. (L.) It is said in a well-known<br>\
trad., السَّمَاحُ رَبَاحٌ The acting in an easy, or a<br>\
gentle, manner, in affairs, is a means of gain, or<br>\
profit, to the performer thereof. (L.) And you<br>\
say, فِى الأَمْرِ ↓ سامحهُ He acted in an easy, or a<br>\
gentle, manner with him. (TK.) And سَمَحَ لَهُ<br>\
and بِهِ, and ↓ اسمح, He made [a thing] easy to<br>\
him. (L.) And اِسْمَحْ يُسْمَحْ لَكَ (Meyd, Mgh,<br>\
L) and بِكَ, (L,) and يُسْمَحْ لَكَ ↓ أَسْمِحْ (Meyd,<br>\
L) and بِكَ, (L,) a trad., (Mgh, L,) meaning<br>\
Facilitate thou, and facilitation shall be rendered<br>\
to thee: (As, Sh, L:) or act thou in an easy, or<br>\
a gentle, manner, and easy, or gentle, treatment,<br>\
shall be rendered to thee: (Mgh:) or be thou compliant, and compliance shall be rendered to thee.<br>\
(Meyd.) And سَمَحَ لَهُ بِحَاجَتِهِ, and ↓ اسمح, He<br>\
made easy to him the object of his want. (IAar,<br>\
L: see also a similar phrase above.) ―<br>\
-b4-  سَمَاحَةٌ<br>\

the verb is سَمُحَ,] in a branch, or rod, signify<br>\
(tropical:)  The being even and smooth, without any knots<br>\
[or inequality of thickness: see سَمْحٌ]. (A, TA.)<br>\

-b2-  تَسْمِيحُ الرُّمْحِ means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The straightening, or making even, of the spear,<br>\

two places.<br>\

manner, one with another. (S, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence]<br>\
تَسَامُحٌ [as a conventional term in lexicology, or<br>\
in relation to language,] is [A careless, or defective, manner of expression,] when the meaning of<br>\
a sentence is not known, and, in order to its being<br>\
understood, requires another word or phrase to<br>\
be supplied: (KT:) [or the using a careless mode<br>\
of expression, relying upon the understanding of<br>\
the reader or hearer; as also ↓ تَسَمُّحٌ: or] a<br>\
deficiency in what a speaker says, relying upon<br>\
[the knowledge of] the person addressed. (Marginal note in a copy of the KT, subsigned سمع<br>\
[app. to denote that the authority is Isma&#39;eel<br>\
Hakkee].) [See also تَسَاهُلٌ, which is often used<br>\
as though it were syn. with تَسَامُحٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  The primary meaning of تَسَامُحٌ and ↓ تَسَمُّحٌ is [said to<br>\
be] The being wide, or ample: whence the phrase<br>\
فِى الحَقِّ مَسْمَحٌ [expl. below]. (Msb.)<br>\
7<br>\
السمح [app. syn. with أَسْمَحَ, or perhaps a<br>\
mistranscription for the latter word]: see اِنْسَجَحَ.<br>\
سَمْحٌ (T, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ سَمِحٌ, of<br>\
which the former is a contraction, (Msb,) [but<br>\
which is seldom used,] as also ↓ سَمِيحٌ and [in<br>\
an intensive sense] ↓ مِسْمَحٌ (T, M, TA) and<br>\
↓ مِسْمَاحٌ (T, S, * M, A, * K, * TA) [and ↓ سَمُوحٌ,<br>\
occurring in the K voce نَعُوسٌ, the last three fem.<br>\
as well as masc.], Liberal, bountiful, munificent,<br>\
or generous: (T, S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K, TA:)<br>\

M, A, K,) applied to men and to women, (T,<br>\
M, A, *) pl. of مِسْمَاحٌ, (A,) or as though pl. of<br>\
مِسْمَاحٌ. (S, K.) The dim. of سَمْحٌ is ↓ سُمَيْحٌ<br>\
and ↓ سُمَيِّحٌ; (K;) but the latter is by some disallowed. (TA.) You say also, فُلَانٌ سَمْحٌ لَمْحٌ<br>\
and لَمِيحٌ ↓ سَمِيحٌ [app. meaning Such a one is<br>\
very liberal, &amp;c.; for in each case the latter epithet<br>\
is probably an imitative sequent, and therefore a<br>\
corroborative]. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  دَابَّةٌ سَمْحَةٌ [A beast that<br>\
is submissive, or easy, or gentle: and probably<br>\
also quick: see 1]. (A, voce جَمْحَةٌ, q. v.) ―<br>\

[Hence, app.,] سَمْحَةُ is the name of A mare of<br>\

any knot: (A, K, TA:) or of even growth, so<br>\

more slender than its two extremities or than one<br>\
of them. (AHn, TA.) One says also سَاجَةٌ<br>\
