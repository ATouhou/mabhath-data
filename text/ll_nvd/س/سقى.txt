سَقَاهُ, aor. يَسْقِيهِ, (K,) inf. n. سَقْىٌ; (TA;<br>\
[see also سِقَايَةٌ, which is likewise said to be an<br>\
inf. n. of the same verb;]) and ↓ سقّاهُ, (K,) with<br>\
teshdeed; (TA;) and ↓ اسقاهُ; (K, TA; [in the<br>\
CK, erroneously, اسْتَقاهُ;]) all have one meaning;<br>\
(TA;) [i. e. He gave him to drink, generally<br>\
water, often milk, and sometimes poison or some<br>\
other thing: and the first often signifies he<br>\
watered him, namely, a beast; and in like manner<br>\
seed produce &amp;c., i. e. irrigated it; as will be<br>\
shown by what follows:] or سَقَاهُ [is said when<br>\
you mean he gave him drink] لِشَفَتِهِ [to his lip],<br>\
(S,) or بِالشَّفَةِ [by means of the lip], as also<br>\
↓ سقّاهُ; and ↓ اسقاهُ means he directed him to<br>\
water, (K,) or he watered (سَقَى) his cattle or<br>\
his land: (S, * K:) or both of them, (K, TA,)<br>\
i. e. سَقَاهُ and ↓ اسقاهُ, (TA,) signify he assigned<br>\
to him, or gave to him, (جَعَلَ لَهُ,) water, (K,<br>\
TA,) or drink, or water for irrigation; so that<br>\
سَقَاهُ is like كَسَاهُ, and ↓ اسقى is like آَلْبَسَ, as Sb<br>\
says: (TA:) or, as some say, سَقَيْتُهُ I gave him<br>\
water to his mouth; and ↓ أَسْقَيْتُهُ, I assigned to<br>\
him, or gave to him, (جَعَلْتُ لَهُ,) drink, or water<br>\
for irrigation, that he might do as he would;<br>\
and like them are كَسَوْتُهُ and أَكْسَيْتُهُ: (Ham<br>\
p. 45:) Er-Rághib says that السَّقْىُ signifies the<br>\
giving one drink; and ↓ الإِسْقَآءُ, the giving one<br>\
drink so that he may take it howsoever he will;<br>\
so that the latter is more ample in meaning than<br>\
the former. (TA.) Both سَقَى and ↓ اسقى are<br>\
sometimes used in relation to what is in the bellies<br>\
of camels or other cattle; [meaning their milk;]<br>\
as in the Kur [xxiii. 21], where it is said,<br>\
مِمَّا فِى بُطُونِهَا ↓ نُسْقِيكُمْ, or نَسْقِيكُمْ, [i. e. We give<br>\
you to drink of what is in their bellies,] accord.<br>\
to different readings. (TA.) One says, سَقَاهُ المَآءَ,<br>\
[He gave him to drink water, or the water,]<br>\
inf. n. as above: (Mgh:) and المَآءَ ↓ سَقَّيْتُهُ [I<br>\
gave him to drink water, or the water, much, or<br>\
often]: the teshdeed denotes muchness, or frequency. (S.) [See also a tropical usage of the<br>\
former verb in a verse cited in p. 85, col. 3: and<br>\
another, from Tarafeh, in p. 134, col. 3. One<br>\
says also, سَقَى المَآءَ, without a second objective<br>\
complement, He supplied, or gave, water, or the<br>\
water.] And سَقَيْتُ الزَّرْعَ, [I watered, or irrigated, the seed-produce,] inf. n. as above; as also<br>\
↓ أَسْقَيْتُهُ, (Msb.) And سَقَيْتُ فِى القِرْيَةِ and<br>\
فِيهَا ↓ أَسْقَيْتُ [I poured water into the water-skin]: a poet says, [in one of my copies of the S,<br>\
Dhu-r-Rummeh,]<br>\
وَمَاشَنَّتَا خَرْقَآءَ وَاهٍ كِلَاهُمَا<br>\
سَقَى فِيهِمَا مُسْتَعْجِلٌ لَمْ تَبَلَّلَا<br>\
بِأَنْبَعَ مِنْ عَيْنَيْكَ لِلدَّمْعِ كُلَّمَا<br>\
تَعَرَّفْتَ دَارًا أَوْ تَوَهَّمْتَ مَنْزِلَا<br>\
[And two old and worn-out skins of an unskilful woman who has not sewed them well,<br>\
each of them unsound, into which a person in<br>\
haste has poured water, they not having been<br>\
previously moistened, (تَبَلَّلَا being for تَتَبَلَّلَا,)<br>\
are not more liable to the shedding of their water<br>\
than are thine eyes to the shedding of tears<br>\
whenever thou investigatest a dwelling or imaginest a place of alighting, or abode]. (S.) [And<br>\
hence, app.,] سَقَى فُلَانٌ فِى ذَكَرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one<br>\
became vehemently affected by sexual appetite.<br>\
(JK.) One says also, سَقَاهُ اللّٰهُ الغَيْثَ and ↓ اسقاهُ<br>\
(S, Msb, * K) God sent down rain to him, or may<br>\
God send &amp;c.: (K:) both of these verbs being<br>\
used by Lebeed in his saying,<br>\
سَقَى قَوْمِى بَنِى مَجْدٍ وَأَسْقَى<br>\
نُمَيْرًا وَالقَبَائِلَ مِنْ هِلَالِ<br>\
[May He send down rain to my people, the sons<br>\
of Mejd, and may He send down rain to Numeyr,<br>\
and the tribes of Hilál]. (S.) [Hence,] one<br>\
says, سَقَى اللّٰهُ عَصْرَ الشَّبِيبَةِ (assumed tropical:)  [May God freshen<br>\
as with rain the times, or mornings, or afternoons,<br>\
of youth, or young manhood]. (A and TA in art.<br>\
شب.) And سَقَيْتُ فُلَانًا, (S,) and ↓ أَسْقَيْتُهُ, and<br>\
↓ سَقَّيْتُهُ, (S, K, *) which last is the form in most<br>\
repute as expressive of a prayer, (Ham p. 45,)<br>\
and of which the inf. n. is تَسْقِيَةٌ, (K,) I said to<br>\
such a one سَقَاكَ اللّٰهُ [May God send down rain<br>\
to thee], (S and K in explanation of the second<br>\
and third,) or سَقْيًا [which virtually means the<br>\
same, for سَقَاكَ اللّٰهُ سَقْيًا]: (S in explanation of the<br>\
first and second, and K in explanation of the<br>\
second and third:) [or,] accord, to some, one<br>\
says سَقَيْتُهُ when it [which he gives, i. e. water or<br>\
the like,] is in his hand; [agreeably with the first<br>\
explanation in this art.;] and ↓ أَسْقَيْنُهُ signifies I<br>\
prayed for him, saying سَقْيًا لَكَ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
سَقَى بَطْنُهُ, (JK, S, MA, K,) inf. n. سَقِىٌ; (JK,<br>\
S;) and سُقِىَ, (JK, IAth, TA,) or سَقِى, aor.<br>\
يَسْقَى, inf. n. سِقًى or سَقًى; (MA;) and ↓ استسقى;<br>\
(JK, S, K; [in my copy of the Msb استقى,<br>\
which I doubt not to be a mistranscription, as the<br>\
verb most commonly known in the sense here<br>\
following is استسقى, and as this is not there<br>\
mentioned;]) His belly [was, or became, diseased<br>\
with dropsy, i. e.] had yellow water [meaning<br>\
serum] (JK, S, Msb, K, * TA) apparent in it,<br>\
(JK,) or collected in it; (S, K, TA;) for which<br>\
there is scarcely, or never, any cure; (Msb,<br>\
TA;) his belly became swollen [with dropsy].<br>\
MA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [In the phrase written in the CK<br>\
سُقِىَ قُلْبُهُ عَدَاوَةًُ, the verb is correctly سُقِىَ:<br>\

stopping. (TA.) ―<br>\

JK,) inf. n. تَسْقِيَةٌ, (JK, TA,) (tropical:)  His heart was<br>\
made to imbibe enmity, (K, TA,) is said of a man<br>\
to whom a thing that he dislikes, or hates, has<br>\
been repeatedly done. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
مُسَاقَاةٌ [The giving to drink, one with another.<br>\
See a tropical usage of its verb in an ex.<br>\
cited in art. شف, conj. 8. ―<br>\
-b2- ] The drawing<br>\
of water together. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And a man&#39;s employing a man to take upon himself, or manage,<br>\
the culture [or watering &amp; c.] of palm-trees<br>\
or grape-vines [or the like] on the condition<br>\
of his having a certain share of their produce:<br>\

term it مُعَامَلَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَسْقَىَ see 1, in thirteen places. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also,<br>\
أَسْقَيْتُهُ رَكِيَّتِى I assigned to him my well [to draw<br>\
water therefrom]: and أَسْقَيْتُهُ جَدْوَلًا مِنْ نَهْرِى I<br>\
assigned to him [a streamlet as] a place, or<br>\
source, of irrigation, from my river, or rivulet;<br>\
and أَسْقَيْتُ لَهُ مِنْهُ [which means the same].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اسقاهُ It produced in him [dropsy,<br>\
or] yellow water. (JK. [See 1, near the end of<br>\
the paragraph.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And He gave him a made<br>\
[shin such as is termed] سِقَآء: (Az, K, TA: [it is<br>\
said in the TA that وَهَبَ مِنْهُ in the K should be<br>\
وَهَبَ لَهُ, as in the explanation by Az: but see art.<br>\
وهب, in which it is said that وهب منه is allowable, and occurs in several trads.:]) or he gave<br>\
him a hide to make of it a سِقَآء: (K:) or اسقاهُ<br>\
إِهَابًا has the latter meaning: (JK, TA:) and<br>\
أَسْقِ إِهَابَهَا occurs in a trad. as meaning Give<br>\
thou its hide to him who will make of it a سِقَآء,<br>\
(TA,) or make thou its hide to be a سِقَآء for thee.<br>\
(JK.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also, (JK, S, K, TA,) and ↓ سَقَاهُ, (K,)<br>\

spoke evil of him, or traduced him, in his absence<br>\
or otherwise], (JK, S, K, TA,) in a foul manner;<br>\
(TA;) and imputed to him a vice, fault, or the<br>\
like: (S, TA:) and J cites [in the S] a verse<br>\
of Ibn-Ahmar ending with the phrase أَسْقَى<br>\

of me, &amp; c.]. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تسقّى It (a thing) received, or admitted,<br>\

كَمَا تَقَطَّرَ جِذْعُ الدَّوْمَةِ القُطُلُ<br>\
meaning [Thrown down upon the ground, his<br>\
skin] becomes drenched with his blood (يَتَشَرَّبُهُ)<br>\
[like as drips the severed trunk of the Theban<br>\
palm-tree]: or, as some relate the verse, يَتَكَسَّى<br>\
[becomes overspread, here meaning suffused],<br>\
from الكِسْوَةُ. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تَسَقَّتِ الإِبِلُ الحَوْذَانَ<br>\

8<br>\
استقى He drew water (TA) مِن البِئْرِ [from<br>\
the well], (S, TA,) and مِنَ النَّهْرِ [from the river,<br>\
or rivulet]. (TA. [Golius and Freytag make<br>\
the verb in this sense, erroneously, استسقى; but<br>\
the former mentions استقِىِ also in the same<br>\
sense.]) [And استقى عَلَى بَعِيرٍ He drew water<br>\
upon a camel in a manner expl. voce سَانِيَةٌ, q. v.:<br>\
often occurring in the Lexicons.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And (tropical:)  He<br>\
was, or became, fat, (K, TA,) and satisfied with<br>\
drinking of water. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 10, in two<br>\

استسقى He sought, or demanded, drink<br>\
(سِقْيًا, K, TA, [in the CK سَقْيًا,] i. e. مَا يُشْرَبُ,<br>\
TA); منْهُ [from him]; as also ↓ استقى. (K,<br>\
TA. [In the CK is immediately added after this<br>\
explanation, وسَقِيًّا: but this is a mistranscription<br>\
for وَتَقَيَّأَ; expressing another signification of these<br>\
two verbs, which will be expl. below.]) And He<br>\
asked, begged, or prayed, for rain; (Msb, * TA;)<br>\
i. q. اِسْتَمْطَرَ (S in art. مطر, and Msb. *) [Hence,<br>\
صَلَاةُ الاِسْتِسْقَآءِ The prayer of the petitioning for<br>\
rain. And استسقى لَهَا He said سَقَاهَااللّٰهُ May<br>\
God send down rain upon it, namely, a land:<br>\

تَقَيَّأَ; [see a statement above, in this paragraph,<br>\
respecting a mistranscription in the CK;] as also<br>\

―<br>\
-b3-  See also 1, in the last quarter of the paragraph.<br>\
سَقْى in the phrase سَقْىُ الفُرَاتِ, which means<br>\
The towns, or villages, [or lands,] watered by the<br>\
Euphrates, is said by Mtr to be an inf. n. used as<br>\
a subst. [properly so termed, and, being originally an inf. n., it may be used alike as sing. and<br>\
pl.]; or, in this phrase, a noun that should be<br>\
prefixed to it [such as ذَات], is suppressed: or,<br>\
accord. to some, it is سِقْى [q. v.], an instance of<br>\
the measure فِعْلٌ in the sense of the measure<br>\
مَفْعُولٌ; and thus it is in the handwriting of EI-<br>\
Hareeree in his 22nd Makámeh. (Har p. 246.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next paragraph.<br>\
سِقْىٌ Drink; or what is drunk; (TA;) or<br>\
what is given to drink; (K, TA;) a subst. from<br>\
سَقَاهُ and أَسْقَاهُ; (S, TA; [in the former of which,<br>\
this meaning is indicated, and also the meaning<br>\
of water given to drink to cattle; and water with<br>\
which land is irrigated;]) in the M, drink given<br>\
to camels: (TA:) pl. أَسْقِيَةٌ. (S, TA.) And<br>\
[particularly] A share, or portion, of water [for<br>\
irrigation]: one says, كَمْ سِقْىُ أَرْضِكَ [How<br>\
many bucketfuls or skinfuls, (the specificative<br>\
being suppressed,) virtually meaning how much,<br>\
is the share, or portion, of water for the irrigation of thy land?]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Water,<br>\
(K, TA, [in the CK ما, a mistranscription for<br>\
مَآءٌ,]) i. e. yellow water [meaning serum, effused<br>\
in dropsy], incidental in the belly, (K, TA,)<br>\
scarcely, or never, curable; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ سَقْىٌ: (K: [وَيُفْتَحُ being there added: and the<br>\
word as meaning “ yellow water ” is written only<br>\
with fet-h in the JK: but in the TA, ويفتح forms<br>\
part of the addition here following:]) or it is in<br>\
white نَفَافِيخ [meaning cells] in the fat of the<br>\
belly; [in which sense, also, the word is written<br>\
only with fet-h in the JK;] and it [app. meaning the belly] is opened (وَيُفْتَحُ) on the occasion<br>\
of its issuing: so says ISd: (TA:) a subst. from<br>\
سَقَى بَطْنُهُ [q. v.]. (S, TA.) And A skin [or<br>\
membrane] containing yellow water, which cleaves<br>\
asunder from over the head of the young one [at<br>\
the birth]: (K, TA:) or, as in the T, the water<br>\
that is in the [membrane called] مَشِيمَة, that<br>\
comes forth عَلَى رَأْسِ الوَلَدِ [meaning at the birth].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Land that is irrigated; having<br>\
the meaning of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, like نِقْضٌ [in<br>\
the sense of مَنْقُوضٌ]: (Er-Rághib, TA: [see also<br>\
سَقْى:]) or it signifies, (K,) or so ↓ سَقِىٌّ, of the<br>\
same measure as شَقِىٌّ and صَبِىٌّ, (Mgh,) and<br>\
↓ مَسْقَوِىٌّ, (S, Mgh, K,) app. a rel. n. from مَسْقًى,<br>\
not from مَسْقِىٌّ, for if it were from the latter it<br>\
would be مَسْقِىٌّ, (M, TA,) [or, accord. to some,<br>\
if from مَسْقِىٌّ, it may be either مَسْقِىٌّ or مَسْقَوِىٌّ,<br>\
(see Lumsden&#39;s Arab. Gr. p. 630,)] seed-produce<br>\
irrigated (S, Mgh, K) by water running upon<br>\
the surface of the earth; (S, Mgh;) [i. e., not<br>\
by rain only;] ↓ سَقِىٌّ being the contr. of بَخْسِىٌّ;<br>\
(Mgh;) and ↓ مَسْقَوِىٌّ, contr. of مَظْمَئِىٌّ, (Mgh,<br>\
TA,) which signifies “ watered [only] by the<br>\
rain; ” and the vulgar say ↓ مِسْقَاوِى. (TA.)<br>\
بَطْنٌ سَقٍ A belly swollen [with dropsy]. (MA.)<br>\
سُقْيَا A giving of drink; [or a giving to drink;]<br>\
like [the inf. n.] سَقْىٌ. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And A sending down of rain upon mankind and<br>\
the lands: (TA:) a subst. from سَقَاهُ اللّٰه الغَيْثَ.<br>\
(S, K, * TA. *) One says, دَعَوْتُ لَهُ بِالسُّقْيَا [I<br>\
prayed for him for the sending down of rain].<br>\
(JK.) And it is said in a form of prayer, سُقْيَا<br>\
رَحْمَةٍ وَلَا سُقْيَا عَذَابٍ [We ask of Thee a sending<br>\
down of a rain of mercy, and not a sending down<br>\
of a rain of punishment]; meaning, send Thou<br>\
down upon us a rain in which shall be benefit,<br>\
without injury, and without laying waste. (Msb.)<br>\
One says also أَرْضٌ خَافِضَةُ السُّقْيَا Land easy of<br>\
irrigation [either by the rain or otherwise]: (K<br>\
in art. خفض:) and the contr. is termed رَافِعَةُ<br>\
السُّقْيَا. (TA in that art.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also i. q. شرب [i. e.<br>\
شِرْبٌ, meaning A beast&#39;s share, or portion, of<br>\
water]: so in the Kur xci. 13. (Jel.)<br>\

skin of a young goat or sheep when it has entered<br>\
its second year, (M, K,) used for water and for<br>\
milk, (ISk, JK, S, Msb, K, KL,) or, accord. to<br>\
ISd, only for water: (TA:) it is termed اِبْنُ أَدِيمٍ<br>\
[made of one hide; but there are larger sorts];<br>\
and if larger, it is termed اِبْنُ أَدِيمَيْنِ [made of<br>\
two hides], and اِبْنُ ثَلَاثَةِ آدِمَةٍ [made of three<br>\
hides]: (T and TA in art. بنى:) accord. to ISk,<br>\
the وَطْب is peculiarly for milk; and the نِحْى,<br>\
for clarified butter; and the قِرْبَة, for water: (S:)<br>\
the pl. (of pauc., S) is أَسْقِيَةٌ and أَسْقِيَاتٌ and (of<br>\
mult., S) أَسَاقٍ, (S, K,) or this last is a pl. pl. (T,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 4, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b3-  [And see a<br>\
phrase voce حِذَآءٌ, in art. حذو, where it is applied<br>\

Also A cloud having large drops [of rain], (S,<br>\
K,) vehement in the falling [thereof]: (S:) [like<br>\
رَمِىٌّ and رَوِىٌّ:] pl. أَسْقِيَةٌ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The<br>\
papyrus (بَرْدِىّ): (JK, S, K:) or tender papyrus:<br>\
so called because of its growing in, or near to,<br>\
water: (TA:) occurring in a verse of Imra-el-<br>\
Keys, cited voce مُذَلَّلٌ: (S, TA: [but see what<br>\
is said under this word, مذلّل: and see Ham<br>\
p. 555:]) n. un. سَقِيَّةٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And Palm-trees;<br>\
(S, K;) and سَقِيَّةٌ signifies [the same, or] palmtrees that are irrigated by means of water-wheels<br>\
(دَوَالٍ, [pl. of دَالِيَةٌ, q. v.]). (TA.)<br>\
سُقَايَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
سِقَايَةٌ and ↓ سُقَايَةٌ and ↓ مَسْقَاةٌ and ↓ مِسْقَاةٌ A<br>\
place for giving to drink or for watering: (K, *<br>\
TA:) what is termed سِقَايَةُ المَآءِ is well known:<br>\
(S:) i. e. سِقَايَةٌ signifies a place made, or prepared, for the giving to drink to people: (Msb:)<br>\
a construction for water: (Mgh:) or a place in<br>\
which beverage is made, or prepared, at the fairs,<br>\
or festivals, &amp;c.: (JK, T, TA:) [and particularly<br>\
a place in which a beverage made of raisins<br>\
steeped in water was given at the general assembly<br>\
of the pilgrims:] and ↓ مَسْقَاةٌ signifies a drinkingplace [in a general sense]: and he who pronounces<br>\
it with kesr to the م [↓ مِسْقَاةٌ] makes it to be like<br>\
the utensil called مِسْقَاةُ الدِّيكِ [the drinking-vessel<br>\
of the cock]: (S:) [see تُرْفَةٌ:] and the pl. is<br>\
مَسَاقٍ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سِقَايَةٌ also signifies A vessel in<br>\
which one is given to drink: (K:) in the Kur<br>\
[xii. 70], it means the king&#39;s drinking-cup;<br>\
(Mgh;) his صُوَاع, in [or from] which he drank,<br>\
(JK, S, TA,) and with which they measured<br>\
corn; and it was a vessel of silver. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And سِقَايَةُ الحَاجِ means The beverage made of<br>\
raisins steeped in water which [the tribe of]<br>\
Kureysh used to give to the pilgrims to drink: it<br>\
was under the superintendence of El-&#39;Abbás in<br>\
