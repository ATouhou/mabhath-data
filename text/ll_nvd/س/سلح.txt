-b2-  [Hence,] تَسَلَّحَتِ الإِبِلُ بِأَسْلِحَتِهَا: see سِلَاحٌ.<br>\
سَلْحٌ Excrement, ordure, or dung: (L, TA:<br>\
[and evidently so accord. to the Msb; in my copy<br>\
of which, and so, app., in the copy used by SM,<br>\
immediately after the mention and explanation of<br>\
the verb سَلَحَ, is added, وهو سلحة تسمية بالمصدر;<br>\
plainly showing, by what follows سلحة, that this<br>\
word is a mistranscription for سَلْحُهُ; and that<br>\
the meaning is, “and it is its سَلْح, an instance of<br>\
the inf. n. used as a subst. properly so called; ”<br>\
i. e., the dung of a bird is called its سَلْح; for the<br>\
verb is there said to relate to a bird; though in<br>\
truth it has a general application:]) or such as is<br>\
thin, of any dung: (L, TA: [and this is the<br>\
sense in which it is commonly known:]) and<br>\
↓ سُلَاحٌ signifies [the same: i. e.] excrement,<br>\
ordure, or dung, (S, A, MA, L, K, KL,) of a<br>\
human being, (KL,) or of a bird (MA) [and of<br>\
any animal]: or thin excrement or dung: (MA:)<br>\
this latter is said to be the correct meaning in a<br>\
marginal note in a copy of the S: (TA:) the pl.<br>\
of the former is سُلُوحٌ and سُلْحَانٌ. (L, TA.)<br>\
[رَمَى بِسَلْحِهِ frequently occurs in the Lexicons<br>\
&amp;c., meaning He cast forth his excrement, or<br>\
ordure; or properly, in a thin state.] يَا سَلْحَ<br>\
الغُرَابِ [lit. O dung of the crow], an expression<br>\
used by &#39;Omar, means يَا خَبِيثُ (assumed tropical:)  [O foul, or<br>\
filthy, man]. (Mgh.)<br>\
سُلْحٌ signifies رُبّ [i. e. Rob, or inspissated<br>\
juice, generally of dates,] with which a skin for<br>\
clarified butter is rubbed over, (K, TA,) for the<br>\
purpose of seasoning it. (TA.)<br>\
سِلْحٌ: see سِلَاحٌ.<br>\
سَلَحٌ Rain-water in pools left by torrents:<br>\
(K:) so says ISh: but not heard by Az from the<br>\
Arabs. (TA.)<br>\
سُلَحٌ The young of the حَجَل [or partridge];<br>\
(S, K;) like سُلَكٌ and سُلَفٌ: (S:) [a coll. gen. n.:<br>\
n. un. with ة: for] it is said in the T that سُلَحَةٌ and<br>\
سُلَكَةٌ signify the young one of the حَجَل: (TA:)<br>\
pl. سِلْحَانٌ, (T, S, K,) like سِلْكَانٌ. (T, TA.)<br>\
سِلَحٌ: see سِلَاحٌ.<br>\
سُلْحَانٌ: see سِلَاحٌ.<br>\
سُلَاحٌ: see سَلْحٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also A looseness, or flux<br>\
of thin excrement from the bowels: diarrhœa.]<br>\
سِلَاحٌ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) as also ↓ سَلِحٌ<br>\
(accord. to the K) or ↓ سِلْحٌ (accord. to the Msb)<br>\
and ↓ سُلْحَانٌ, (K,) [the last mentioned in the L<br>\
as a pl.,] A weapon, or weapons; i. e. an instrument, or instruments, of war; (A, K;) the thing<br>\
[or things] with which one fights in war, and<br>\
repels, or defends oneself; (Msb;) anything with<br>\
which one repels the enemy, as a sword and<br>\
spear &amp;c.: (Ham p. 73:) or a weapon, or<br>\
weapons, of iron: (Lth, Mgh, K:) it is of the<br>\
masc. gender, (S, Msb, TA,) accord. to the more<br>\
approved usage, (TA,) or that which most prevails, (Msb,) because in the pl. it takes the form<br>\
of أَسْلِحَةٌ, which is a pl. form of a masc. n., (S,<br>\
Msb, *) as in the instances of أَحْمِرَةٌ, pl. of حِمَارٌ,<br>\
and أَرْدِيَةٌ, pl. of رِدَآءٌ, (S,) but it is also fem.,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) and has also for pls. سُلُحٌ and سُلْحَانٌ,<br>\
(L,) and the pl. fem. is سِلَاحَاتٌ. (Msb.) You<br>\
say رَجُلٌ ذُو سِلَاحٍ [A man having a weapon or<br>\
weapons]. (K.) And قَوْمٌ ذَوُو سِلَاحٍ [A people, or<br>\
party, having weapons, or arms]. (S, A, K.) And<br>\
لَبِسَ السِّلَاحَ [He wore, or put on, the weapon, or<br>\
the weapons, or arms]. (S, A, K.) And أَخَذَ القَوْمُ<br>\
أَسْلِحَتَهُمْ The people, or party, took their weapons,<br>\
or arms, each taking his. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A sword<br>\
(Az, Mgh, K) alone is sometimes termed سِلَاحٌ.<br>\
(Az, Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A bow without a string (K)<br>\
is likewise thus termed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A staff,<br>\
or stick. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  سِلَاحُ لثَّوْرِ means (assumed tropical:)  The horns<br>\
of the bull. (S, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  ذُو السِّلَاحِ is (tropical:)  an appel-lation of السَّمَاكُ الرَّامِحُ [i. e. The star Arcturus].<br>\
(A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And أَخَذَتِ الإِبِلُ سِلَاحَهَا and<br>\
بِأَسْلِحَتِهَا mean (tropical:)  The camels became<br>\
fat, and of goodly appearance; (A, L, TA;)<br>\
i. e. their fat became as though it were weapons<br>\
with which they prevented their being slaughtered:<br>\
(L, TA:) and the like has been mentioned before,<br>\
[voce رُمْحٌ,] in art. رمح. (TA.)<br>\
سَالِحٌ A man having, (K,) or having with him,<br>\
(S,) a weapon, or weapons: (S, K:) an epithet<br>\
[of the possessive kind, having no verb,] similar<br>\
to تَامِرٌ and لَابِنٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And A she-camel<br>\
that has voided excrement, [or thin excrement,]<br>\
in consequence [of the eating] of herbs, or leguminous plants. (S, K.)<br>\
أَسْلَحُ مِنْ حُبَارَى [More wont to mute than a<br>\
bustard] (Meyd, A, Mgh) and مِنْ دَجَاجَةٍ [than<br>\
a domestic hen]: the former mutes in the time of<br>\
fear; and the latter, in the time of security:<br>\
(Meyd:) a prov. (Meyd, Mgh.)<br>\
إِسْلِيحٌ A certain plant, the pasturing upon<br>\
which causes the milk (S, K) of the camels (S) to<br>\
become abundant: (S, K:) or a certain kind of<br>\
tree, or shrub, that has this effect: (L:) [see also<br>\
إِسْلِيخٌ:] it was said to an Arab woman of the<br>\
desert, “What is thy father&#39;s tree? ” and she<br>\
answered, شَجَرَةُ أَبِى الإِسْلِيحْ رُغْوَةٌ وَصَرِيحٌ وَسَنَامٌ<br>\
إِطْرِيحْ [The tree of my father is the isleeh: froth<br>\
upon the milk, and milk free from froth; and a<br>\
long, or tall, hump: these are the consequences<br>\
of pasturing upon it]: (S, * L:) or it is a certain<br>\
herb, or leguminous plant, of those that are<br>\
slender and soft (مِنْ أَحْرَارِ البُقُولِ), growing in<br>\
the winter, that causes the camels to void سُلَاح<br>\
[or thin excrement] when they eat much of it:<br>\
or a certain herb (عُشْبَة), resembling the جِرْجِير<br>\
[or rocket], growing upon tracts of sand such as<br>\
are termed حُقُوف: or a certain kind of plant,<br>\
growing conspicuously in plain, or soft, tracts,<br>\
having a thin and delicate leaf, and a pericarp<br>\
(سِنْفَة) stuffed with grains, or seeds, like those of<br>\
the poppy; which is one of the plants of the rain<br>\
of the صَيْف [here meaning spring (see زَمَنٌ)],<br>\
and which causes the cattle to void سُلَاح: n. un.<br>\
with ة: Aboo-Ziyád says that the places in<br>\
which the اسليح grows are sands. (L.)<br>\
مَسْلَحَةٌ A ثَغْر [or frontier of a hostile country]:<br>\
(K:) or a place of arms or weapons, (Mgh,) like<br>\
a ثَغْر and a مَرْقَب [which is an elevated place of<br>\
observation], (S, Mgh, TA,) wherein are parties<br>\
that watch the enemy, lest they should make an<br>\
invasion at unawares, and , when they see them,<br>\
inform their companions, in order that they may<br>\
prepare themselves for them: (Nh, TA:) pl.<br>\
مَسَالِحُ. (S, Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, [in one of my copies<br>\
of the S erroneously written مُسَلَّحَة,] A people,<br>\
or party, having arms, or weapons; an armed<br>\
people or party; (S, A, K, TA;) composing a<br>\
numerous body, in a place of observation, with<br>\
the keeping of which they are entrusted, at the<br>\
frontier of an enemy&#39;s country; a single person<br>\
of whom is termed ↓ مَسْلَحِىٌّ; (A, * L;) and<br>\
مَسْلَحَةٌ [also] is thus applied to a single person<br>\
in a saying of &#39;Omar: (Mgh:) they are thus<br>\
called because of their having weapons, or because<br>\
of their occupying the place called مَسْلَحَةٌ: (Nh:)<br>\
or the مسلحة of the army are a party of<br>\
capturers that go before the army, exploring for<br>\
them the way, and searching as spies to learn<br>\
news of the enemy, lest the enemy should make a<br>\
sudden assault upon them; not suffering any one<br>\
of the enemy to enter the territory of the Muslims,<br>\
and warning the Muslims of the approach of an<br>\
army. (ISh.)<br>\
