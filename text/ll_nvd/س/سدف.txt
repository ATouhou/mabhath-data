سدّفهُ, (M, TA,) inf. n. تَسْدِيفٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
cut it in pieces; namely, a camel&#39;s hump. (M,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسدف It (the night) became dark; (S, M,<br>\
K;) accord. to some, after the جِنْح [app. as<br>\
meaning the first part thereof; or about the<br>\
half; or a great, or the greater, part]: (M:)<br>\
or let down its curtains, and became dark: and<br>\
ازدف and اسدف signify the same. (AO, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And اسدف القَوْمُ The people, or party, entered<br>\
upon the [period of the night called] سُدْفَة. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And اسدف He slept; (AA, K, TA;) as also<br>\
ازدف. (AA, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  His eyes became<br>\
dark by reason of hunger or age: (K, TA:) said<br>\
of a man. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also, said of the daybreak,<br>\
or dawn, It shone: (S, K, TA:) [thus,] as AO<br>\
says, it has two contr. significations. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
And He lighted the lamp: (K:) or one says, in<br>\
the dial. of Hawázin, أَسْدِفُوا, i. e. أَسْرِجُوا [Light<br>\
ye a lamp, or with a lamp]; from السِّرَاجُ: (S,<br>\
TA:) or one says in that dial., أَسْدَفُوا لَنَا, i. e.<br>\
أَسْرَجُوا [They lighted for us a lamp, or with a<br>\
lamp]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Also He moved away or aside<br>\
[in order that the light might enter a place].<br>\
(K.) When a man is standing at a door or an<br>\
entrance, one says to him, أَسْدِفْ, i. e. Move thou<br>\
away or aside from the door, or entrance, in<br>\
order that the chamber, or tent, may become<br>\
light. (AA, TA. [See also the last sentence of<br>\
this paragraph.]) ―<br>\
-b8-  [In all of these senses, perhaps excepting one, it is intrans.: in others,<br>\
trans.]<br>\
-A2-  You say of a woman, اسدفت القِنَاعَ,<br>\
(S, TA,) and الحِجَابَ, (TA,) She let down [the<br>\
head-covering, and the veil, or curtain]. (S, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And اسدف السِّتْرَ He raised [the veil, or curtain]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  One says also, أَسْدِفِ البَابَ Open<br>\
thou the door, or entrance, in order that the<br>\
chamber, or tent, may become light. (S.)<br>\
سَدَفٌ: see سُدْفَةٌ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The<br>\
night. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The daybreak, or dawn:<br>\
(AA, S, K:) and the advent thereof: (Fr, S, K:)<br>\
and the whiteness of day. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A ewe:<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K:) or such as has a blackness like<br>\
that of night. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And سَدَفْ سَدَفْ is A<br>\
call to the ewe to be milked. (K.)<br>\
سَدْفَةٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
سُدْفَةٌ and ↓ سَدْفَةٌ i. q. ↓ سَدَفٌ, (As, S, M, K,)<br>\
as meaning The darkness, (As, S, K,) in the dial.<br>\
of Nejd, (As, S,) or of Temeem; (K;) or as<br>\
meaning the darkness of night; or, as some say,<br>\
after the جِنْح [which here app. means the first<br>\
part of the night; or about the half; or a great,<br>\
or the greater, part]: (M:) and also as meaning<br>\
the light, (As, S, K, and M in explanation of the<br>\
first word,) in the dial. of others, (As, S,) or of<br>\
Keys: (K:) thus having two contr. significations; (S, K;) or the darkness and the light are<br>\
called by one and the same name because each of<br>\
them comes upon the other: (K:) or the first,<br>\
(S, M, K,) and second, (K,) the commingling of the<br>\
light and the darkness, (S, M, K,) as in the time<br>\
between the rising of the dawn, (S,) or as in the<br>\
time between the prayer of the dawn, (M,) and<br>\
that when the sun becomes white, (S, M,) accord.<br>\
to some, as is said by A &#39;Obeyd; (S;) or, as<br>\
&#39;Omárah says, the first signifies darkness in which<br>\
is light, of the former part of the night and of<br>\
the latter part thereof, between the redness after<br>\
sunset and the darkness and between the dawn<br>\
and the prayer [of the dawn]; And Az says that<br>\
this is the correct explanation: (TA:) and the<br>\
first and second, a portion of the night: (M, K:)<br>\
or the first, a remaining portion of the night: (Ibn-<br>\
Habeeb, TA:) or the first of five divisions of the<br>\
night: (TA in art. خدر: see خُدْرَةٌ, voce خَدَرٌ:)<br>\
and the first, (K, TA,) i. e. with damm, (TA,)<br>\
or the second, (CK,) as also ↓ سَدَفٌ, the blackness of night: (K:) the pl. of the first is سُدَفٌ;<br>\
as in the saying of &#39;Alee, كَشَفْتُ عَنْهُمْ سُدَفَ اللَّيْلِ<br>\
I removed from over them the darknesses of night:<br>\
(TA:) and the pl. of ↓ سَدَفٌ is أَسْدَافٌ. (M,<br>\
TA.) You say also, رَأَيْتُ سُدْفَةَ شَخْصِهِ مِنْ بُعْدٍ<br>\
(tropical:)  I saw the blackness of his body, or form, from<br>\
a distance. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also the first, A door, or<br>\
an entrance: (M, K:) or its سُدَّة [i. e. vestibule,<br>\
or porch, &amp;c.]: (K:) and a sort of covering over<br>\
a door to protect it from the rain. (K, * TA.)<br>\
سُدُوفٌ [a pl. of which the sing. is app. سَدَفٌ,<br>\
like شَدَفٌ,] The corporeal forms or figures or<br>\
substances of men or other things which one sees<br>\
from a distance: (K:) accord. to Sgh, (TA,)<br>\
correctly with ش: (K, TA:) but the truth is,<br>\
that they are two dial. vars. (TA.)<br>\
سَدِيفٌ A camel&#39;s hump: (S:) or a camel&#39;s<br>\
hump cut into pieces: (M, TA:) or pieces [or<br>\
slices] of a camel&#39;s hump: (Ham p. 258:) or the<br>\
fat of a camel&#39;s hump: (M, K, and Ham p. 257:)<br>\
[or a very fat hump of a camel: (Freytag, from<br>\
the Deewán of Jereer:)] pl. سَدَائِفُ and سِدَافٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
سِدَافَةٌ A veil, or covering; a thing that veils,<br>\
conceals, covers, or protects: whence the saying<br>\
of Umm-Selemeh to &#39;Áïsheh, (O, K, TA,) when<br>\
she desired to go forth to El-Basrah, (TA,)<br>\
قَدْ وَجَّهْتِ سِدَافَتَهُ i. e. هَتَكْتِ السِّتْرَ i. e. أَخَذْتِ وَجْهَهَا<br>\
[i. e. وَجْهَ سِدَافَتِهِ (JM in art. وجه) Thou hast<br>\
rent open his veil, or covering, meaning the Prophet&#39;s, as is shown in the TA]: (O, K, TA:) or<br>\
thou hast removed his veil, or covering: (O, TA:)<br>\
or thou hast removed his veil, or covering, from<br>\
its place, to which thou wast commanded to keep,<br>\
and hast placed it before thee: (O, K, TA:) but<br>\
the saying is also related otherwise, i. e. وَجَّهْتِ<br>\
سِجَافَتَهُ, mentioned before [in art. سجف]. (TA.)<br>\
One says also, وَجَّهَ فُلَانٌ سِدَافَتَهُ, meaning Such a<br>\
one quitted his veil, or covering, and came forth<br>\
from [behind] it. (TA.)<br>\
أَسْدَفُ, as an epithet applied to night, Dark,<br>\
(M, [as also مُسْدِفٌ,]) or black. (K.)<br>\
مُسْدِفٌ Dark: [like أَسْدَفُ:] and also light:<br>\
having two contr. significations. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And Entering upon the [period called] سُدْفَة.<br>\
(TA.).<br>\
سَنَامٌ مُسَدَّفٌ A camel&#39;s hump cut into pieces [or<br>\
slices]. (M.)<br>\
حِجَابٌ مَسْدُوفٌ A veil, or curtain, let down.<br>\
