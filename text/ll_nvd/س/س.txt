س<br>\
The twelfth letter of the alphabet; called<br>\
سِينٌ. It is one of the letters termed مَهْمُوسَة [or<br>\
non-vocal, i. e. pronounced with the breath only,<br>\
without the voice]; and of the letters termed<br>\
أَسَلِيَّة, as also ص and ز, because proceeding from<br>\
the tip of the tongue: its place of utterance is<br>\
between that of ص and that of ز: and Az says<br>\
hat it is never conjoined with either of these two<br>\
letters in any Arabic word: (TA:) it is a sibilant<br>\
letter; and is distinguished from ص by the<br>\
raising of the tongue to the palate [in the utterance of the latter], and from ز by the suppression<br>\
of the voice [in the utterance of the former].<br>\
(K in art. سين.) It is one of the letters of augmentation [occurring in the form اِسْتَفْعَلَ and its<br>\
derivatives]. (S and L in art. سين.) [See also<br>\
سِينٌ in art. سين. It is sometimes substituted for<br>\
ص; as in سَقْرٌ, for صَقْرٌ: and for ش, as in سِطْرَنْجٌ,<br>\
for شِطْرَنْجٌ: (see De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe, sec.<br>\
ed., ii. 230-233: and iii. 530-532:)] and AZ<br>\
says that some of the Arabs substitute for it ت,<br>\
(S and L and K * in art. سين,) as in the saying<br>\
(S and L in art. سين) of &#39;Alyà Ibn-Arkam,<br>\
(L ib.,)<br>\
يَا قَبَحَ اللّٰهُ بَنِى السِّعْلَاتِ<br>\
عَمْرَو بْنَ يَرْبُوعٍ شِرَارَ النَّاتِ<br>\
لَيْسُوا أَعفَّآءَ وَلَا أَكْيَاتِ<br>\
[O, may God remove far from good, or from<br>\
prosperity, the sons of the Sialáh, &#39;Amr Ibn-Yarbooa, the worst of mankind: they are not<br>\
chaste, nor sharp in intellect]: he means النَّاسِ<br>\
and بِأَكْيَاسِ: (S and L ib.:) and in like manner<br>\
one says طَسْتٌ for طَسٌّ. (TA in art. كيت.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
يٰس in the Kur [commencing ch. xxxvi.] is like<br>\
آلم and حٰم at the commencement of chapters of<br>\
the same; and is said by &#39;Ikrimeh to mean<br>\
يَا إِنْسَانُ [O man]; because it is followed by the<br>\
words إِنَّكَ لَمِنَ المُرْسَلِينَ: (S and L in art. سين:)<br>\
or it means either thus, or يَا سَيِّدُ [O man of<br>\
dignity]. (K in art. سين.)<br>\
-A2-  سَ is a particle<br>\
peculiarly prefixed to the aor., rendering it clearly<br>\
denotative of the future, (Mughnee, and S * and<br>\
L * in art. سين,) as in سَيَفْعَلُ [He will do such a<br>\
thing], (S and L ib.,) and considered as forming<br>\
a part thereof, for which reason it does not exercise any government upon it: it is not contracted from سَوْفَ, contrary to what the Koofees<br>\
hold: nor is the extent of the future with it<br>\
shorter than it is with سَوْفَ, contrary to what the<br>\
Basrees hold: the analytical grammarians term<br>\
it حَرْفُ تَنْفِيسٍ, by which is meant a particle of<br>\
amplification; because it changes the aor. from<br>\
the strait time, which is the present, to the ample<br>\
time, which is the future: but plainer that their<br>\
expression is the saying of Z and others, [that it<br>\
is] a particle denoting the future. (Mughnee.)<br>\
Kh asserts that it corresponds [as an affirmative]<br>\
to [the negative] لَنْ. (S and L in art. سين.)<br>\
Some assert that it sometimes denotes continuance,<br>\
not futurity: this is mentioned in relation to the<br>\
saying in the Kur [iv. 93], سَتَجِدُونَ آخَرِينَ [as<br>\
though meaning Ye continually find others];<br>\
and they adduce as an evidence thereof the saying<br>\
in the same [ii. 136], سَيَقُولُ السَّفَهَآءُ مِنَ النَّاسِ مَا<br>\
وَلَّاهُمْ عَنْ قِبْلَتِهِمْ [as meaning The light-witted of<br>\
the people continually say, What hath turned<br>\
them away, or back, from their kibleh?]; affirming<br>\
that this was revealed after their saying مَا وَلَّاهُمْ:<br>\
but this the grammarians know not; and that<br>\
this verse was revealed after their saying ما ولّاهم<br>\
is not a fact agreed upon: moreover, if it be conceded, still continuance is inferred from the aor.;<br>\
like as when you say, فُلَانٌ يَقْرِى الضَّيْفَ and<br>\
يَصْنَعُ الجَمِيلَ, you mean that it is his custom to<br>\
do thus. (Mughnee.) Z asserts that when it is<br>\
prefixed to a verb signifying what is liked or<br>\
disliked, it denotes that the event will inevitably<br>\
happen: i. e., when it is prefixed to a verb signifying a promise or a threat, it corroborates and<br>\
confirms its meaning. (Mughnee.)<br>\
