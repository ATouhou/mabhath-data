with سَمِعَ (Msb,K) as trans. By itself; (Msb;)<br>\
and استمع [also] in sys. With سَمِعَ [ as trans.<br>\

its act. part. n. showing the verb to be trans. by<br>\

signifying only he gave ear, hearkened, or listened: but سَمِعَ, [as also ↓ تمسمّع and ↓ استسمع,]<br>\

or listened to, the thing] (S.) And الصَّوْتَ ↓ تسمّع<br>\

سَمِعْتُ لَهُ صَوْتًا I heard him, or it, utter, or produce, a sound; lit. I heard a sound attributable<br>\
to him, or it. And سَمِعَهُ مِنْهُ He heard it form<br>\

سَمِعَ بِهِ [He heard of it; for سَمِعَ التَّكَلُّمَ بِهِ, or<br>\
the like]. (Kur xii. 31 and xxviii. 36 and<br>\
xxxviii. 6, S, K, TA.) [When trans. by means<br>\

You say, سَمِعْتُ لَهُ, (S, Msb, TA,) and إِلَيْهِ, (S,<br>\
TA,) meaning I gave ear, hearkened, or listened,<br>\
to him, or it; (S, Msb, * TA;) and له ↓ تسمّعت<br>\

same; (S, Msb, TA;) and so له ↓ استمعت, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) and اليه. (K.) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[xxxvii. 8], accord. to different readings, لَا<br>\
يَسْمَعُونَ إِلَى المَلَإِ الأَعْلَى, and ↓ لَا يَسَّمَّعُونَ, They<br>\

see those words below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  It also signifies He<br>\
understood it; (TA;) he understood its meaning;<br>\
i. e., the meaning of a person&#39;s speech. (Msb.)<br>\
You say, لَمْ تَسْمَعْ مَا قُلْتُ لَكَ Thou didst not<br>\
understand what I said to thee. (TA.) And<br>\
such is the most obvious meaning of the verb in<br>\
the saying, إِنْ كَانَ يَسْمَعُ الخَطِيبَ [If he understand the words of the preacher]; for this is the<br>\
proper meaning in this case: but it may be rendered tropically, (tropical:)  if he hear the voice of the<br>\
preacher. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also He knew it: as in<br>\
the saying, سَمِعَ اللّٰهُ قَوْلَكَ [God knew thy saying].<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\

recompensed it by acceptance: (Msb:) (tropical:)  he paid<br>\
regard to it, and answered it; namely, prayer:<br>\
(tropical:)  he answered, or assented to, or complied with,<br>\
it; namely, a person&#39;s speech. (TA.) The saying<br>\
سَمِعَ اللّٰهُ لِمَنْ حَمِدَهُ means May God accept the<br>\
praise of him who praiseth Him: or, accord. to<br>\
IAmb, may God recompense by acceptance the<br>\
praise of him who praiseth Him: (Msb:) or may<br>\
God answer the prayer of him who praiseth Him.<br>\
(TA, as on the authority of IAmb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He obeyed him: as in the saying in the Kur<br>\
[xxxvi. 24], إِنِّى آمَنْتُ بِرَبِّكُمْ فَاسْمَعُونِ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily<br>\
I believe in your Lord, and do ye obey me].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Lth says that the phrase سَمِعَتْ أُذُنِى<br>\
زَيْدًا يَفْعَلُ كَذَا وَكَذَا means (assumed tropical:)  My eye saw Zeyd<br>\
doing such and such things: but Az says, I know<br>\
not whence Lth brought this; for it is not of the<br>\
way of the Arabs to say سمعت اذنى as meaning<br>\
my eye saw: it is in my judgment corrupt language, and I am not sure but that it may have<br>\
been originated by those addicted to innovations<br>\
and erroneous opinions. (TA.)<br>\

maketh men to hear of his deed,] God will make<br>\
the ears of his creatures to hear of him on the<br>\
day of resurrection; (TA;) or whoso maketh his<br>\
deed notorious, that men may see it and hear of<br>\
it, God will make notorious his hypocrisy, and<br>\
fill with it the ears of his creatures, and they<br>\
shall be generally acquainted with it, [and He<br>\
will render him contemptible, and small in estimation,] so that he will become disgraced; (Mgh;)<br>\
or the meaning may be, God will manifest to<br>\
men his internal state, and fill their ears with<br>\
the evilness of his secret intentions, in requital of<br>\
his deed: or, as some relate it, [for أَسَامِعَ خَلْقِهِ] we<br>\
should say, سَامِعُ خَلْقِهِ, which is an epithet applied<br>\
to God; so that the meaning is, Go [the Hearer<br>\
of his creatures] will disgrace him: (TA:) [for]<br>\

(S, K,) [&amp;c.,] or the latter is a simple subst. [used<br>\
in the abstract sense of the former]. (Msb.) You<br>\

emphatic mode of expression, meaning I hear and<br>\
I obey, or for سَمِعْتُ سَمْعًا وَأَطَعْتُ طَاعَةً, which<br>\
means the same, but more emphatically; طَاعَةً<br>\
being a quasi-inf. n. for إِطَاعَةً;] the verb [of each]<br>\
being understood: and سَمْعٌ وَطَاعَةٌ, meaning<br>\
أَمْرِى ذٰلِكَ [i. e. أَمْرِى سَمْعٌ وَطَاعَةٌ My affair is<br>\
hearing and obeying]. (K.) You say also, [in<br>\
like manner,] اَللّٰهُمَّ سَمْعًا لَا بَلْغًا, (K,) and سَمْعٌ لَا<br>\

ذٰلِكَ, (K,) [said to be] the only instance of the<br>\
kind among inf. ns. of trans. verbs except رَأْىُ<br>\

[My ear heard (lit. my ear&#39;s hearing) such a one<br>\
say that]. (K) ―<br>\
-b2-  [As a simple subst., it signifies] The sense of the ear; (K;) [i. e., of hearing;] the faculty in the ear whereby it perceives<br>\
sounds. (TA.) Thus in the Kur [1. 36], أَوْ أَلْقَى<br>\
السَّمْعُ, (TA,) meaning, Or who hearkeneth. (Bd,<br>\
Jel.) [And hence,] أُمُّ السَّمْعِ The brain; (Z, O,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ أُمُّ السَّمِيعِ. (O, K.) One says,<br>\

brain]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [It is also used for the inf. n.<br>\
of أَسْمَعَ. Hence] one says, قَالُوا ذٰلِكَ سَمْعَ أُذُنِى,<br>\

and اذنى ↓ سَمَاعَةَ, i. e. إِسْمَاعَهَا [They said that<br>\
making my ear to hear]: (K:) and one may say,<br>\
سَمْعًا [making to hear]: this latter one says when<br>\
he does not particularize himself. (Sb, K.) And<br>\
↓ كَلَّمَهُ سِمْعَهُمْ, with kesr, meaning, [He spoke<br>\
to him making them to hear, or] so that they<br>\
heard. (TA.) And a poet says,<br>\
اللّٰهِ وَالعُلَمَآءِ أَنِّى ↓ سَمَاعَ<br>\
أَعُوذُ بِخَيْرِ خَالِكَ يَاابْنَ عَمْرِو<br>\

I seek protection by the goodness of thy maternal<br>\
uncle, O son of &#39;Amr; or أَعُوذُ بِحَقْوِ خَالِكَ, i. e.<br>\
I have recourse for protection to thy maternal<br>\
uncle; thus in the TA in art. حقو;] using the subst.<br>\
in the place of the inf. n., as though he said إِسْمَاعًا<br>\
عَنِّى. (TA.) One says also, أَخَذْتُ ذٰلِكَ عَنْهُ سَمْعًا,<br>\
and in like manner, ↓ سَمَاعًا, [i. e. I received that<br>\
from him by being made to hear, which virtually<br>\
means, by hearsay, or hearing it from him,]<br>\
making the inf. n. [in each case] to be of a different form from that of the verb to which it<br>\
belongs [in respect of signification; i. e., using an<br>\
inf. n. of سَمِعَ for that of أَسْمَعَ]. (K, * TA.) [See<br>\
also سُمْعَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  It also signifies The ear; (S, *<br>\
Mgh, Msb, * K;) as also ↓ مِسْمَعٌ, (S, Msb, K,<br>\

(Aboo-Jebeleh, TA,) and ↓ سَامِعَةٌ; (S, K;) or<br>\
↓ مِسْمَعٌ signifies the ear-hole; (TA;) and so<br>\
↓ مَسْمَعٌ, and ↓ مُسْتَمَعٌ: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and<br>\
سَمْعٌ is also used as a pl., (S, K,) being originally<br>\
an inf. n.; but sometimes (S) it has for its pl.<br>\
أَسْمَاعٌ (S, Msb, K) and أَسْمُعٌ, (Mgh, O, K,) a<br>\
pl. of pauc., (TA,) [as is also the former,] and<br>\
أَسَامِعُ is a pl. pl., (S, Mgh, O, K,) i. e. pl. of<br>\
أَسْمَاعٌ, (S,) or of أَسْمُعٌ: (Mgh, O:) [for an ex.<br>\
of the pl. pl., see 2:] the pl. of ↓ مِسْمَعٌ is مَسَامِعُ;<br>\
(Msb, K;) or this may be an irreg. pl. of سَمْعٌ,<br>\
like as مَشَابِهُ is of شَبَهٌ. (Sgh, TA.) You say,<br>\
سَمْعُكَ إِلَىَّ i. e. [Incline thine ear to me; or] hear<br>\
thou from me. (S, K.) And طَرَقَ الكَلَامُ السَّمْعُ<br>\

as a pl. in the Kur [ii. 6], where it is said, خَتَمَ<br>\
اللّٰهُ عَلَى قُلُوبِهِمْ وَعَلَى سَمِعْهِمْ [God hath set a<br>\
seal upon their hearts and upon their ears].<br>\
(S.) One also says, ↓ فُلَانٌ عَظِيمُ المِسْمَعَيْنِ Such<br>\
a one is great in the ears. (S.) The phrase<br>\
هُوَ بَيْنَ سَمْعِ الأَرْضِ وَبَصَرِهَا means (assumed tropical:)  It is not<br>\
known whither he has repaired: (AZ, K:) or<br>\
he is between the ears of the people of the land and<br>\
their eyes, [so that they neither hear him nor see<br>\
him,] the prefixed noun أَهْل being suppressed:<br>\
(AO, K, * TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  in a void land, wherein is<br>\
no one; (ISk, K;) i. e., none hears his speech,<br>\
nor does any see him, except [the wild animals<br>\
of] the desert land: (K:) or (tropical:)  between the length<br>\
and breadth of the land. (K, TA.) You say<br>\
also, أَلْقَى نَفْسَهُ بَيْنَ سَمْعِ الأَرْضِ وَبَصَرِهَا (assumed tropical:)  He exposed himself to perdition, or imperilled himself,<br>\
and cast himself no one knew where: (IAar,<br>\

established by received usage: as in the phrase,<br>\
مَقْصُورٌ عَلَى السَّمَاعِ restricted to what has been<br>\

فِى السَّمَاعِ deviating from the constant course of<br>\

he, however, adds, I do not deny that, in the<br>\
language of the Arabs, سميع may be syn. with<br>\
