سَرَجَ, (O, K,) aor.<br>\
سَرُجَ, (K,) inf. n. سَرْجٌ,<br>\
(TK,) (assumed tropical:)  He lied; as also سَرِجَ, (O, K,) aor.<br>\
سَرَجَ;<br>\
(K;) but the latter is outweighed [in authority];<br>\
(TA;) like سَدَجَ: (O:) and so ↓ سرّج: (TA:)<br>\
and شَرَجَ. (O and K * in art. شرج.) You say,<br>\
↓ تَكَلَّمَ فُلَانٌ بِكَلِمَةٍ فَسَرَجَ عَلَيْهَا بِأُسْرُوجَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a<br>\
one spoke a word, or sentence, and followed it<br>\
with a lie]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And سَرَجَ الكَذِبَ, aor.<br>\
سَرُجَ,<br>\
inf. n. سَرْجٌ, (assumed tropical:)  He forged the lie. (TA.) [See<br>\
also 2.]<br>\
-A2-  سَرَجٌ, as an inf. n., signifies The being<br>\
bright, or shining. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] سَرِجَ,<br>\
(O, K,) aor.<br>\
سَرَجَ, (K,) inf. n. سَرَجٌ, (TK,) said of<br>\
one&#39;s face, (assumed tropical:)  It was, or became, beautiful: (O:)<br>\
or, said of a man, (TA,) (tropical:)  he was or became,<br>\
beautiful in his face: (K, TA:) but said by<br>\
some, to be post-classical; and by some, to be<br>\
strange. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  سَرَجَتْ شَعْرَهَا, (O, K, TA, but<br>\
not in the CK,) and ↓ سرّجت, (K, TA, but not<br>\
in the O,) [thought by SM to be a mistranscription for سرّحت, with the unpointed ح,] She (a<br>\
woman, O) plaited her hair; (O, K;) like<br>\
سَجَرَتْهُ. (O.)<br>\
-A4-  [سَرَجَ, aor.<br>\
سَرُجَ, expl. as signifying<br>\
“ Ephippio instruxit instravitve equum ” by Golius and Freytag, by the latter as on the authority<br>\
of the S and K, I do not find in either of those<br>\
lexicons, nor in any other. The verb having this<br>\
meaning is اسرج only.]<br>\
2<br>\
سرّجهُ, (A, K,) inf. n. تَسْرِيجٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
rendered it beautiful; (A, K;) namely, a person&#39;s<br>\
face; said of God: (A:) (assumed tropical:)  he adorned, ornamented, decorated, or embellished, it; namely, a<br>\
thing. (L.) The meaning given in the K [and<br>\
A] has the authority of El-Beyhakee and IKtt<br>\
and Es-Sarakustee and IKoot; but Aboo-&#39; AbdAllah Mohammad Ibn-Esh-Shádhilee thought it<br>\
to be not of established authority as belonging to<br>\
the ancient language. (TA.) [Hence,] one says,<br>\
سَرِّجْ إِلَيْهِ أَمْرَكَ (assumed tropical:)  Embellish and elucidate thou to<br>\
him thy affair, or case. (Ham p. 326.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q.<br>\
وَفَّقَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [He accommodated, adapted, or disposed,<br>\
him, or it, to a right course, or issue]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\

against me a lie]. (A, TA.) And عَلَىَّ ↓ تسرّج<br>\
(tropical:)  He lied, or lied purposely, against me. (A, TA.<br>\
[See also تسدّج.]) And إِنَّهُ يُسَرِّجُ الأَحَادِيثَ<br>\

TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 1, first sentence.<br>\

شَعْرَهَا: see 1.<br>\

أَسْرَجْتُ السِّرَاجَ (O, Msb, TA) I lighted the<br>\
lamp, or wick. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And اسرج signifies also He lighted himself or another with a<br>\
lamp &amp;c.; and so ↓ استسرج: or each of these,<br>\
with بِهِ following it, he employed it (i. e. a lamp,<br>\
or oil, &amp;c.,) as a means of light: see اِصْطَبَحَ, in<br>\
art. صبح.]<br>\
-A2-  أَسْرَجْتُ الدَّابَّةَ, (S, K, *) or الفَرَسَ,<br>\
(Msb,) I bound the saddle, or his saddle, upon<br>\
the beast, or horse: (Msb, K:) or I made a<br>\

Q. Q. 1<br>\
سَرْجَنَ الأَرْضَ He manured the land<br>\
with سِرْجِين. (L in art. سرجن.)<br>\
سَرْجٌ A certain appertenance of a horse or<br>\
similar beast, (Msb, K, *) well known; (S, Msb;)<br>\
i. e., his رَحْل [or saddle]: (TA:) an Arabic<br>\
word; or, accord. to the Shifá el-Ghaleel, arabicized from سرك [which is written by Freytag<br>\
شرك, and said by him to be Pers., but I know<br>\
not either of these two words in Pers. with an<br>\
apposite meaning]: (TA:) dim. ↓ سُرَيْجٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
and pl. سُرُوجٌ. (Mgh, Msb, TA.) [Hence,] مَالَ<br>\
سَرْجُكَ (assumed tropical:)  Thy affair, or case, was or has become,<br>\
in a disordered, or an unsound, state: a proverbial<br>\
saying. (Ham p. 242.)<br>\
سُرْجَجٌ Continuing, or lasting; or continuing,<br>\
or lasting, long; or, for ever. (O, K.)<br>\
سُرْجُوجٌ Foolish, or stupid. (O, K.)<br>\
سِرْجِينٌ i. q. زِبْلٌ [i. e. dung of horses or other<br>\
solid-hoofed animals, or fresh dung of camels,<br>\
sheep and goats, wild oxen, and the like; used<br>\
for manure]: (Msb, and K in art. سرجن:) a<br>\
foreign, or Pers., word, (Msb,) originally سَرْكِين,<br>\
[meaning سَرْگِينْ,] (Msb, K,) arabicized, (Msb,<br>\
and S and K in art. سرجن,) by the conversion of<br>\
the ك [or گ] into ج, and also into ق, so that one<br>\
says also سِرْقِينٌ [q. v.]: As is related to have said,<br>\
I know not how to say it, and I only say رَوْثٌ: it is<br>\
with kesr to the first letter in order to agree with<br>\
Arabic words; fet-h not being allowable, because<br>\
there is no instance of the measure فَعْلِيلٌ; though<br>\
it is said in the M to be سِرْجِينٌ and سَرْجِينٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) [the word being arabicized, all its letters<br>\
should be regarded as radical; but] many assert<br>\
the ن to be augmentative [and therefore mention<br>\
the word, or the two words, in the present art.,<br>\
as does the author of the Msb]. (TA.)<br>\
سُرْجُوجَةٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ سِرجِيجَةٌ (O, K)<br>\
Nature; or natural, native, or innate, disposition, or temper, or the like: (S, O, K, TA:) and<br>\
a way, mode, or manner, of acting or conduct or<br>\
the like. (S, O, TA.) One says, هُمْ عَلَى سُرْجُوجَةٍ<br>\
وَاحِدَةٍ They are of one uniform nature or disposition. (As, S, O.) And الكَرَمُ مِنْ سِرْجِيجَتِهِ<br>\
and سُرْجُوجَتِهِ Generosity is a quality of his<br>\
nature or disposition. (Lh, TA.) And إِنَّهُ لَكَرِيمُ<br>\
السُّرْجُوجَةِ and السِّرْجِيجَةِ Verily he is generous of<br>\
nature or disposition. (AZ, TA.)<br>\
سِرْجِيجَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
سِرَاجٌ a word of well-known meaning; (S, O,<br>\
K;) i. q. مِصْبَاحٌ [i. e. A lamp, or its lighted wick,<br>\
(the latter of which meanings is assigned to both<br>\
of these words by Jel in xxiv. 35,)] (L, Msb,<br>\
TA) that gives light by night: (L, TA:) or, properly, a lighted wick; its employment to signify<br>\
the place thereof [i. e. a lamp, generally a vessel<br>\
of glass having in its bottom a small glass tube into<br>\
which the lower part of the wick is inserted,]<br>\
being a well-known tropical application: (MF,<br>\
TA:) pl. سُرُجٌ. (O, Msb, TA.) [See also مَسْرَجَةٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] the sun is called a سِرَاج [in the<br>\
Kur lxxi. 15, and also xxv. 62, and lxxviii. 13],<br>\
(S, O,) and السِّرَاجُ, (K,) and سِرَاجُ النَّهَارِ (tropical:)  [The<br>\
lamp of day]. (A, TA.) So too is the Prophet.<br>\
(Kur xxxiii. 45.) &#39;Omar, also, is called in a trad.<br>\
سِرَاجُ أَهْلِ الجَنَّةِ (assumed tropical:)  [The lamp of the people of<br>\
Paradise]. (TA.) And one says, الهُدِى سِرَاجٌ<br>\
المُؤْمِنِينَ (tropical:)  [The Kur-án is the lamp of the believers], (A,) or سِرَاجُ المُؤْمِنِ [the lamp of the<br>\
believer]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, metaphorically, (tropical:)  The<br>\
eye; because of its being often likened to a سِرَاج.<br>\
(Har p. 554.)<br>\
سُرَيْجٌ dim. of سَرْجٌ, q. v. (Msb.)<br>\
سِرَاجَةٌ The craft, or occupation, of the سَرَّاج<br>\

Certain swords so called in relation to a blacksmith named سُرَيْجٌ: (As, S, O, K:) or they may<br>\
be so called because having much water, and<br>\
[glistening] wavy marks or streaks or grain.<br>\
(Ham p. 326.) [See also مُسَرَّجٌ.]<br>\
سَرَّاجٌ A saddler; i. e. a maker of سُرُوج [or<br>\
saddles]: (O, K, * TA:) or a seller thereof. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also (tropical:)  A great, or habitual, liar, (K, TA,)<br>\
who will not tell thee truly whence he comes, but<br>\
will tell thee lyingly. (TA.) One says, إِنَّهُ سَرَّاجٌ<br>\
مَرَّاجٌ (tropical:)  Verily he is a lying person, (A,) or a<br>\
great, or habitual, liar, (TA,) who adds, or exaggerates, (يَزِيدُ,) in his narration, or talk, or<br>\
discourse. (A, TA.) And it is used alone, [without مَرَّاجٌ,] so that one says, رَجُلٌ سَرَّاجٌ (tropical:)  [A man<br>\
who lies much, or habitually, &amp;c.]. (TA.) [See<br>\
also سَدَّاجٌ.]<br>\
جَبِينٌ سَارِجٌ (assumed tropical:)  [A side of a forehead, or a forehead itself,] clear, or white, [and bright,] like the<br>\
سِرَاج [or lamp]. (Th, TA.)<br>\
سِيرَجٌ i. q. شَيْرَجٌ; (TA in the present art. and<br>\
in art. شرج; [but in the present art., غير الشَّيْرَجِ<br>\
is erroneously put for عَيْنُ الشَّيْرَجِ, meaning the<br>\
same as الشيرج;]) but vulgar; (TA in art. شرج;)<br>\
i. e. Oil of sesame, or sesamum: an arabicized<br>\
word, from [the Pers.] شِيرَهٌ. (TA in the present<br>\
art.)<br>\
أُسْرُوجَةٌ (tropical:)  A lie. (TA.) See 1 and 2.<br>\
مُسْرَجٌ, applied to a horse, (A,) or beast (دَابَّةٌ),<br>\

Saddled; i. e. having the سَرْج bound upon it.<br>\

and ر, (Msb,) [A lamp; i. e.] the thing in which<br>\
is the wick and the oil: (S, Mgh, O, TA:) and<br>\
also the thing upon which the سِرَاج [app. here<br>\
meaning lamp] is put: (O:) or the thing upon<br>\
which the ↓ مِسْرَجَة is placed: (Msb:) or ↓ مِسْرَجَةٌ,<br>\
with kesr, has the last of these meanings: مَسْرَجَةٌ,<br>\
with fet-h, having the first thereof: or, as some<br>\
say, the reverse is the case; (Mgh;) [i. e.]<br>\
↓ مِسْرَجَةٌ, with kesr, signifies the thing in which<br>\
is the wick [and the oil]: and مَسْرَجَةٌ, with fet-h,<br>\
the thing upon which that is put: (A, TA:) the<br>\
pl. (of either, Mgh) is مَسَارِجُ. (Mgh, Msb.) [See<br>\
also سِرَاجٌ.]<br>\
مِسْرَجَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
