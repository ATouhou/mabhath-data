or predominated, over them; or was made to do<br>\
so; he had, or exercised, or was made to have or<br>\

or received, power over them; and superior power<br>\
or force; quasi-pass. of سَلَّطَهُ عَلَيْهِمْ. (TA.)<br>\
سَلْطٌ: see سَلِيطٌ; for the former, in four<br>\
places; and for the latter, in seven.<br>\
سَلِطٌ: see سَلِيطٌ; for the former, in four<br>\

places.<br>\
سَلْطَنَةٌ: see سُلْطَانٌ; for the latter, in three<br>\

سُلْطَانٌ Strength, might, force, or power; (TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ سَلْطَنَةٌ: (Bd in iii. 144:) predominance;<br>\
the possession, or exercise, of superior power or<br>\
force, or of dominion, or authority, and power,<br>\
or of absolute dominion or authority and power;<br>\
(Mgh;) as also ↓ سُلْطَةٌ; (S;) the former being<br>\
syn. with تَسَلُّطٌ [used as a subst.]; (Mgh;) and<br>\
the latter being the subst. from تَسَلَّطَ: (S:)<br>\
power of dominion; sovereign, or ruling, power;<br>\
(M;) [in this sense, as well as in the first,] i. q.<br>\
↓ سَلْطَنَةٌ; (Msb;) power of a king; (Lth, Mgh,<br>\
K;) and of a governor; (Mgh, Msb;) [i. e.]<br>\
delegated power, or power given to one who is not<br>\
a king; (TA;) also written سُلْطَانٌ; (M, Msb,<br>\
K;) which is the only instance of this form:<br>\
(Msb:) it is masc. and fem.; (M, TA;) generally<br>\
masc., in the opinion of the skilful; but sometimes<br>\
fem.; so say IAmb and Zj and others: (Msb:)<br>\
but ISk says that it is fem. (TA.) One says,<br>\
(ISk,) or some say, (Msb,) قَضَتْ بِهِ السُّلْطَانُ<br>\
(ISk, Msb) The sovereign, or ruling, power<br>\
(↓ السَّلْطَنَةُ) decreed it. (Msb.) And Aboo-Zuheyr<br>\
says, I heard one, in whose chasteness of speech<br>\
I have confidence, say, أَتَتْنَا سُلْطَانٌ جَائِرَةٌ [A<br>\
tyrannical sovereign, or ruling, power, came to<br>\
us]. (Msb.) It is said in a trad., إِلَّا أَنْ تَسْأَلَ<br>\
ذَا سُلْطَان ٍ, meaning Unless thou ask the ruler, or<br>\
governor, or the king, for thy due from the public<br>\
treasury. (Mgh.) And you say, قَدْ جَعَلْتُ لَكَ<br>\
سُلْطَانًا عَلَى أَخْذِ حَقِّى مِنْ فُلَان ٍ I have given<br>\
thee power, or authority, to take, or receive, my due<br>\
from such a one. (TA.) And لَا يَؤُمُّ الرَّجُلُ الرَّجُلَ<br>\
فِى سُلْطَانِهِ [A man shall not take precedence of a<br>\
man in his authority]; meaning, in his house,<br>\
and where he has predominance, or superior<br>\
power, or authority; nor shall he sit upon his<br>\
cushion; for in doing so he would show him<br>\
contempt. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Strength, or hardness, of<br>\
anything: (M, K:) sharpness of anything: force,<br>\
or violence, of anything. (TA.) The vehemence<br>\
of winter. (TK.) An excited and predominant<br>\
state of the blood; or inflammation thereof.<br>\
(IDrd, M, K.) The flaming, or blazing, of fire.<br>\
(IDrd.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A proof; an evidence; an argument;<br>\
a plea; an allegation; syn. حُجَّةٌ, (S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) and بُرْهَانٌ: (S, Msb:) a حُجَّة being<br>\
thus called because of the force with which truth<br>\
attacks the mind: (B:) or, accord. to Mohammad<br>\
Ibn-Yezeed, from سَلِيطٌ, (M, TA,) signifying<br>\
“ oil of olives,” because it enlightens: (TA:) and<br>\
in these senses it has no pl., because it is used in<br>\
the place of an inf. n. (S, TA.) Accord. to I&#39;Ab,<br>\
it signifies حُجَّة wherever it occurs in the Kur.<br>\
(TA.) But in the words of the Kur [xvii. 35],<br>\
فَقَدْ جَعَلْنَا لِوَلِّيِهِ سُلْطَانًا, the meaning may be<br>\
either [We have given to his executor, or heir,]<br>\
authority, and power, or absolute authority and<br>\
power, or the like; or a plea, or the like. (Mgh.)<br>\
And again, in the Kur [lxix. 29], هَلَكَ عَنِّى<br>\
سُلْطَانِيَهْ, the meaning may be My dominion, and<br>\
my authority and power over men, has perished<br>\
from me; or my plea. (Bd, B.) And sometimes<br>\
it means A miracle; as in the words of the Kur<br>\
[li. 38], إِذْ أَرْسَلْنَاهُ إِلَى فِرْعَوْنَ بِسُلْطَان ٍ مُبِين ٍ [When<br>\
we sent him to Pharaoh with a manifest miracle].<br>\
(TA.) Az says that it is sometimes masc. because it has a masc. form; and thus it is in the<br>\
last of the instances above. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A<br>\
ruler, or governor, or the like; a king; a sovereign; (S, K, TA;) a khaleefeh: (TA:) these are<br>\
its most common applications [in the writings of<br>\
post-classical times]: (TA:) thus applied because<br>\
the person so called is made to predominate; to<br>\
have, or exercise, superior power or force; to<br>\
have dominion, or the like: or because he is one<br>\
of the evidences of God: (Aboo-Bekr, TA:) or<br>\
because he possesses proof or evidence [of his<br>\
right]: or because by him pleas and rights are<br>\
established: (TA:) or because he enlightens the<br>\
earth, (Msb, * B,) and is of great usefulness;<br>\
(B;) the word being derived from سَلِيطٌ [signifying “ olive-oil ”]: (Msb:) it is of the measure<br>\
فُعْلَانٌ: (S:) and when [thus] applied to a person,<br>\
it is masc.: (Msb:) or it is masc. and fem.: (S,<br>\
TA:) accord. to Mohammad Ibn-Yezeed, (TA,)<br>\
fem. because it is [originally] pl. of سَلِيطٌ applied<br>\
to “ oil; ” as though the kingdom shone by him;<br>\
or because it has the signification of حُجَّةٌ: and<br>\
sometimes masc., because regarded as meaning a<br>\
man; (K, TA;) or because regarded as a sing.:<br>\
so says Mohammad Ibn-Yezeed; but Az observes<br>\
that none beside him says this: Fr says that he<br>\
who makes it masc. regards it as meaning رَجُلٌ;<br>\
and he who makes it fem. regards it as meaning<br>\
حُجَّةٌ: (TA:) the pl. is سَلَاطِينُ. (S, Msb.) It<br>\
is also, itself, sometimes used as a pl.; as in the<br>\
phrase سَيِّدُ السُّلْطَانِ, used by a poet, meaning<br>\
سَيِّدُ السَّلَاطِينَ [The lord of kings]; i. e. the<br>\
khaleefeh: [but this may be rendered the lord of<br>\
sovereign power, &amp;c.:] or, as some say, the latter<br>\
word is here pl. of سَلِيطٌ, like as رُغْفَانٌ is pl. of<br>\
رَغِيفٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
سَلَطَانَةٌ, and سِلِطَانَةٌ, or سِلِطَّانَةٌ: see سَلِيطٌ.<br>\
سَلِيطٌ Strong, or hard; (M, K;) as also ↓ سَلِطٌ,<br>\
(M,) or ↓ سَلْطٌ. (K.) You say, ↓ حَافِرٌ سَلِطٌ,<br>\
(M,) or ↓ سَلْطٌ, (TA,) and سَلِيطٌ, (M, TA,) A<br>\
strong, or hard, solid hoof. (M, TA.) And<br>\
الحَافِرِ ↓ دَابَّةٌ سَلِطَةُ A beast having a strong, or<br>\
hard, hoof. (M.) And الخُفِّ ↓ بَعِيرٌ سَلِطُ A<br>\
camel having a strong, or hard, foot. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Sharp; applied to anything. (K.) You say also<br>\
↓ سَنَابِكُ سَلِطَاتٌ Sharp edges of the fore parts of<br>\
hoofs. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Chaste in speech, or eloquent,<br>\
(S, K,) and sharp in tongue: (S:) an epithet<br>\
of praise when applied to the male, and of dispraise when [with ة] applied to the female:<br>\
(IDrd, K:) also, (K,) long-tongued; (M, K;)<br>\
and so ↓ سَلِطٌ, (M,) or ↓ سَلْطٌ; (K;) fem. سَلِيطَةٌ,<br>\
and ↓ سَلَطَانَةٌ, (M, K,) and ↓ سِلِطَانَةٌ, (K,) or<br>\
↓ سِلِطَّانَةٌ; (M;) the last written [thus] with tesh-deed to the ط in the Jm., and there explained as<br>\
signifying long-tongued and clamorous: (TA:)<br>\
or سَلِيطٌ signifies clamorous and foul-tongued;<br>\
and so سَلِيطَةٌ applied to a woman: (Msb:) or<br>\
the latter, applied to a woman, clamorous: (S:)<br>\
or long-tongued and vehemently clamorous:<br>\
(Lth:) or سَلِيطَةُ اللِّسَانِ is applied to a woman<br>\
in two senses; signifying sharp-tongued; and<br>\
long-tongued. (Az, TA.) You say also, لِسَانٌ<br>\
سَلِيطٌ, (M, K,) and ↓ سَلِطٌ, (M,) or ↓ سَلْطٌ, (K,)<br>\
A long tongue. (M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Oil of olives; (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K;) so applied by the generality of the<br>\
Arabs: but by the people of El-Yemen applied<br>\
to oil of sesame, or sesamum: (S, M:) IDrd, in<br>\
the Jm, says the reverse; and IF has followed<br>\
him; but what J says is right, as Sgh, has observed in the O: (TA:) also, (K,) or as some<br>\
say, (M,) any oil expressed from grains or<br>\
berries: (M, K:) pl. سُلْطَانٌ. (Msb, K.)<br>\
أَسْلَطُ More, and most, overcoming, prevailing,<br>\
predominating, or superior in power or force.<br>\
(Har p. 661.) ―<br>\
-b2-  هُوَ أَسْلَطُهُمْ لِسَانًا He is the most<br>\
chaste, or eloquent, and the sharpest, [&amp;c., (see<br>\
an ex. voce سِلْقٌ,)] of them in tongue. (S.)<br>\
