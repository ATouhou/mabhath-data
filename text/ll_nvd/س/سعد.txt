سَعْدٌ, (MA, Msb, TA,) and of the former, (MA,)<br>\
or of both, (TA,) سَعَادَةٌ, (MA, TA,) or this<br>\
latter is a simple subst.; (Msb;) He (a man, S,<br>\
A, Msb) was, or became, prosperous, fortunate,<br>\
happy, or in a state of felicity; (S, MA, Msb,<br>\
TA;) contr. of شَقِىَ; (S, * Msb, K *) with<br>\
respect to religion and with respect to worldly<br>\
things. (Msb.) You say, سَعِدْتُ بِهِ and سُعِدْتُ<br>\
[I was, or became, prosperous, &amp;c., by means of<br>\
him, or it]. (A.) In the Kur xi. 110, Ks read<br>\
سُعِدُوا [instead of the common reading سَعِدُوا].<br>\
(S.) [See also سَعَادَةٌ, below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And سَعَدَ يَوْمُنَا,<br>\

in like manner the verb is used in relation to a<br>\
star or an asterism &amp;c.; and] سُعِدَ, inf. n. سَعْدٌ,<br>\
signifies [likewise] the contr. of نُحِسَ. (Mgh.)<br>\
[See also سُعُودَةٌ, below.] ―<br>\

ساعدهُ, (A, L, Msb,) inf. n. مُسَاعَدَةٌ (S, L,<br>\
Msb) and سِعَادٌ; (L;) and ↓ اسعدهُ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
إِسْعَادٌ; (S;) He aided, assisted, or helped, him;<br>\
syn. of the former عَاوَنَهُ, (S, * L, Msb,) and of the<br>\
latter أَعَانَهُ: (S, * K:) [like as is said of عَاوَنَهُ and<br>\
أَعَانَهُ,] both signify the same: or مُسَاعَدَةٌ signifies the aiding, or assisting, or helping, in any<br>\
manner or case; and is said to be from a man&#39;s<br>\
putting his arm, or hand, upon the سَاعِد [or fore<br>\
arm] of his companion when they walk together<br>\
to accomplish some object of want, and aid each<br>\
other to do a thing: [so that سَاعَدَهُ more properly signifies he aided him, being aided by him:<br>\
but see سَاعِدٌ:] whereas ↓ إِسْعَادٌ signifies specially<br>\
a woman&#39;s aiding, assisting, or helping, another<br>\
to wail for a dead person: so says El-Khattábee:<br>\
and this is what is meant in a trad. in which<br>\
اسعاد is forbidden. (L.) One says, ساعدهُ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
[He aided, assisted, or helped him against him,<br>\
or it, or to do it]: and النَّائِحَةُ الثَّكْلَى ↓ أَسْعَدَتِ<br>\
The wailing-woman assisted the woman bereft of<br>\
her child to weep and wail. (A.) Accord. to Fr,<br>\
[but this is questionable,] the primary signification of مُسَاعَدَةٌ and ↓ إِسْعَادٌ is A man&#39;s performing diligently the command and good pleasure of<br>\
God. (L.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسعدهُ اللّٰهُ, [inf. n. إِسْعَادٌ,] God rendered him<br>\
prosperous, fortunate, happy, or in a state of<br>\
felicity; (S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ سَعَدَهُ, aor.<br>\

made his good fortune to increase; as also ↓ سَعَدَ<br>\
جَدَّهُ. (L.) And accord. to Az, اسعدهُ اللّٰهُ and<br>\
↓ سَعَدَهُ signify God aided, assisted, or helped,<br>\
him; and accommodated, adapted, or disposed,<br>\
him to the right course. (L, TA.) See also 3, in<br>\

تسعّد He sought after the plant called<br>\
سَعْدَان. (K.)<br>\
10<br>\
استسعد بِهِ He deemed it, or reckoned it,<br>\

استسعد بِرُؤْيَةِ فُلَانٍ He deemed, or reckoned, the<br>\
sight of such a one fortunate, auspicious, or lucky.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He became fortunate by means of him,<br>\

-b3-  He sought good fortune by<br>\
means of him, or it. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And استسعدهُ<br>\
He desired, or demanded, his aid or assistance:<br>\
for] اِسْتِسْعَادٌ also signifies the desiring, or demanding, aid or assistance [of another]. (KL.)<br>\
سَعْدٌ an inf. n. of سَعِدَ, (Msb,) or of سُعِدَ,<br>\
(MA,) or of both: (TA:) and of سَعَدَ: (K,<br>\
TA:) [and also used as a simple subst.:] see<br>\
سَعَادَةٌ [with which it is syn.]: and see also سُعُودَةٌ<br>\
[with which it is likewise syn.]; i. q. يُمْنٌ. (S,<br>\
A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also an inf. n. used as an epithet,<br>\
i. e. Prosperous, fortunate, auspicious, or lucky,<br>\
applied to a day, and to a star or an asterism [&amp;c.:<br>\
so that it may be used alike as masc. and fem.<br>\
and sing. and pl.: but it is also used as originally<br>\
an epithet, forming its fem. with ة; and in this<br>\
case it has for pl. of mult. سُعُودٌ and pl. of pauc.<br>\
أَسْعُدٌ]: you say يَوْمٌ سَعْدٌ, as well as يَوْمُ سَعْدٍ [in<br>\
which it is used as a subst.]; and كَوْكَبٌ سَعْدٌ:<br>\
and IJ mentions لَيْلَةٌ سَعْدَةٌ, in which سَعْدَةٌ is like<br>\
جَعْدَةٌ as fem. of جَعْدٌ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] السَّعْدَانِ<br>\
is an appellation of The two planets Venus and<br>\
Mercury: like as [the contr.] النَّحْسَانِ is applied<br>\
to Saturn and Mars. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, TA in art.<br>\
نحس.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And [hence, also,] سَعْدٌ is an appellation given to Each of ten asterisms, (S, L, K,)<br>\
four of which are in the signs of Capricornus<br>\
and Aquarius, (S, L,) and are Mansions of the<br>\
Moon: pl. [of mult.] سُعُودٌ (S, L, K) and سُعُدٌ;<br>\
but the former is the more known, and more<br>\
agreeable with analogy; and pl. of pauc. أَسْعُدٌ:<br>\
(L:) they are distinguished by the following<br>\
names: — سَعْدُ الذَّابِحِ, (S, L, K,) [or سَعْدٌ الذَّابِحُ,<br>\
see art. ذبح,] Two stars near together, one of<br>\
which is called الذابح because with it is a small<br>\
obscure star, almost close to it, and it seems as<br>\
though the former were about to slaughter it;<br>\
and الذابح is a little brighter that it; (Ibn-Kunáseh;) they are the two stars [<br>\
α and<br>\
β] which<br>\
are in one of the horns of Capricornus; so called<br>\
because of the small adjacent star, which is said<br>\
to be the sheep (شاة) of الذابح, which he is about<br>\
to slaughter; the Twenty-second Mansion of the<br>\
Moon: (Kzw:) [see also art. ذبح:] ―<br>\
-b5-  سَعْدُ بُلَعَ<br>\
(S, L, K) Two obscure stars, lying obliquely, of<br>\
which Aboo-Yahyà says, the Arabs assert that they<br>\
rose [at dawn] when God said, يَا أَرْضُ ابْلَعِى مَآءَكِ<br>\
[Kur xi. 46]; and said to be thus called because<br>\
one of them seems as though about to swallow<br>\
the other, on account of its nearness to it: (Ibn-Kunáseh:) or three stars [app.<br>\
ε and<br>\
μ with the<br>\
star of the same magnitude next to them on the<br>\
north] on [or rather near] the left hand of Aquarius; [the Twenty-third Mansion of the Moon:]<br>\
(Kzw, descr. of Aquarius:) [See also art. بلع:]<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  سَعْدُ السُّعُودِ (S, L, K) Two stars, the most approved of the سُعُود, and therefore thus named,<br>\
resembling سعد الذابح [app. a mistake for سَعْدُ<br>\
البَارِعِ, or some other سعد, not of the Mansions of<br>\
the Moon,] in the time of their [auroral] rising;<br>\
(Ibn-Kunáseh;) the star [<br>\
β] which is on the left<br>\
shoulder-joint of Aquarius, together with the star<br>\
[<br>\
δ] in the tail of Capricornus; [the Twentyfourth Mansion of the Moon:] (Kzw, descr. of<br>\
Aquarius:) or a certain solitary bright star:<br>\
(S:) ―<br>\
-b7-  سَعْدُ الأَخْبِيَةِ (S, L, K) [also called الأَخْبِيَةُ<br>\
and الخِبَآءُ (see خِبَآءٌ in art. خبى)] Three stars, not<br>\
in the track of the other سُعُود, but declining from<br>\
it [a little], in, or respecting, which there is a<br>\
discordance; they are neither very obscure nor<br>\
very bright; and are thus called because, when<br>\
they rise [aurorally], the venomous or noxious<br>\
reptiles of the earth, such as scorpions and serpents, come forth from their holes; (Ibn-Kuná-<br>\
seh;) [and this observation is just; for this<br>\
asterism, about the commencement of the era of<br>\
the Flight, rose aurorally, in Central Arabia, on<br>\
the 24th of February, O. S., after the end of the<br>\
cold season: see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل:] or it<br>\
consists of three stars, like the three stones upon<br>\
which the cooking-pot is placed, with a fourth<br>\
below one of them; (S;) the star [g] that is on<br>\
the right arm, together with the three stars [<br>\
ζ,<br>\
η,<br>\
and<br>\
π,] on the right hand of Aquarius: so called<br>\
because, when it rises [aurorally], the venomous<br>\
or noxious reptiles that have hidden themselves<br>\
beneath the ground by reason of the cold appear:<br>\
(Kzw, descr. of Aquarius; [in some copies, incorrectly, for “ that have hidden themselves,” &amp;c.,<br>\
“ hide themselves beneath the ground by reason<br>\
of the cold: ”]) it is said that the سعد is one star,<br>\
the brightest of four, the other three of which are<br>\
obscure; and it is [correctly] said to be called<br>\
thus because, when it rises [aurorally], the venomous or noxious reptiles that are hidden beneath<br>\
the ground come forth: it is the Twenty-fifth<br>\
Mansion of the Moon: (Kzw, descr. of the Mansions of the Moon:) ―<br>\
-b8-  the following are the other<br>\
سعود, which are not Mansions of the Moon: (S,<br>\
L, K:) ―<br>\
-b9-  سَعْدُ نَاشِرَةَ (S, L, K) [Two stars, situate,<br>\
accord. to Ideler, as is said in Freytag&#39;s Lex., in<br>\
the tail of Capricornus]: ―<br>\
-b10-  سَعْدُ المَلِكِ (S, L, K)<br>\
The two stars [a and o?] on the right shoulder of<br>\
Aquarius: (Kzw:) ―<br>\
-b11-  سَعْدُ البِهَامِ (S, L, K) The<br>\
two stars [<br>\
ε and<br>\
θ?] on the head of Pegasus:<br>\
(Kzw: [but ii. the copies of his work the name<br>\
is written سَعْدُ البَهَائِمِ:]) ―<br>\
-b12-  سَعْدُ الهُمَامِ (S, L, K)<br>\
The two stars [<br>\
ζ and 31 ?] on the neck of Pegasus: (Kzw:) سَعْدُ البَارِعِ (S, L, K) The two<br>\
stars near together [<br>\
μ and and<br>\
λ?] in the breast of<br>\
Pegasus: (Kzw:) ―<br>\
-b13-  سَعْدُ مَطَرٍ (S, L, K) The<br>\
two stars [<br>\
η and<br>\
ο ?] on the right [or left ?] knee of<br>\
Pegasus: (Kzw: but there called سَعْدُ المَطَرِ:)<br>\
―<br>\
-b14-  each سعد of these six consists of two stars:<br>\
between every two stars, as viewed by the eye, is<br>\
[said to be] a distance of a cubit, (ذِرَاع,) (S, L,)<br>\
or about a cubit; (K;) [but this is not correct;]<br>\
and they are disposed in regular order. (S, L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b15-  It is also the name of A certain object of<br>\
idolatrous worship that belonged to the sons of<br>\
Milkán (S, K) the son of Kináneh, (S,) in a<br>\
place on the shore of the sea, adjacent to Juddeh.<br>\
(TA.) A poet says,<br>\
وَهَلْ سَعْدُ إِلَّا صَخْرَةٌ بِتَنُوفَةٍ<br>\
مِنَ الأَرْضِ لَا تَدْعُو لِغَىٍّ وَلَا رُشْدِ<br>\
[And is Saad aught but a mass of rock in a<br>\
desert tract of the earth, not inviting to error<br>\
nor to a right course?]. (S, TA.) Hudheyl is<br>\
said to have worshipped it in the Time of Ignorance. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b16-  بِنْتُ سَعْدٍ is metonymically used<br>\
as meaning (tropical:)  The virginity, or hymen, of a girl or<br>\
woman. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b17-  ↓ أَسَعْدٌ أَمْ سُعَيْدٌ, meaning (tropical:)  Is<br>\
it a thing liked or a thing disliked? (S, A, K,)<br>\
is a prov., (S, A,) which [is said to have] originated from the fact that Saad and So&#39;eyd, [the<br>\
latter name erroneously written in some copies of<br>\
the S and K سَعِيد,] the two sons of Dabbeh the<br>\
son of Udd, went forth (S, K, TA) to seek some<br>\
camels belonging to them, (TA,) and Saad returned, but So&#39;eyd was lost, and his name became<br>\
regarded as unlucky: (S, K, TA:) Dabbeh used<br>\
to say this when he saw a dark object in the<br>\
night: and hence it is said in allusion to care for<br>\
one&#39;s relation; and in inquiring whether a good<br>\
or an evil event have happened. (TA.) [The<br>\
saying may also be rendered, Is it a fortunate<br>\
thing or a little fortunate thing?] ―<br>\
-b18-  سَعْدَيْكَ, in<br>\
the saying لَبَّيْكَ وَسَعْدَيْكَ, signifies Aiding Thee<br>\
after aiding [i. e. time after time]; syn. إِسْعَادًا<br>\
لَكَ بَعْدَ إِسْعَادٍ: (ISk, T, S, L, K:) or aiding Thee<br>\
and then aiding: (Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà, L:) or<br>\
aiding thy cause after aiding [i. e. time after<br>\
time]: (T, L:) and hence it is in the dual<br>\
number: (IAth, L:) El-Jarmee says that it has<br>\
no sing.; and Fr says the same of it, and also of<br>\
لَبَّيْكَ: it is in the accus. case as an inf. n. governed<br>\
by a verb understood. (L.) It occurs in the form<br>\
of words preceding the recitation of the Opening<br>\
Chapter of the Kur-án in prayer, لَبَّيْكَ وَسَعْدَيْكَ<br>\
وَالخَيْرُ بَيْنَ يَدَيْكَ وَالسَّرُّ لَيْسَ إِلَيْكَ [meaning I wait<br>\
intent upon thy service, or upon obedience to Thee,<br>\
time after time, and upon aiding thy cause time<br>\
after time; and good is before Thee, and evil is<br>\
not imputable to Thee]. (L, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The<br>\
third part of the لَبِنَة [or gore] (K, TA) of a<br>\

fourth part thereof. (K, TA.)<br>\
سُعْدٌ and ↓ سُعَادَى A certain kind of perfume,<br>\
(S, K,) well known: (K:) or the former is pl. of<br>\
↓ سُعْدَةٌ, [or rather a coll. gen. n. of which سُعْدَةٌ<br>\
is the n. un.,] and this last is [the name of] a<br>\
certain kind of sweet-smelling root; it is a rhizoma (أَرُومَة), round, black, hard, like a knot;<br>\
which forms an ingredient in perfumes and medicines: (AHn:) and ↓ سُعَادَى is the name of its<br>\
plant; (Lth, AHn;) and its pl. is سُعَادَيَاتٌ:<br>\
(AHn:) or the سُعْد is a certain plant having a<br>\
root (أَصْل) beneath the ground, black, and of<br>\
sweet odour: and the ↓ سُعَادَى is another plant:<br>\
(Az:) [in the present day, the former of these<br>\
two names (سُعْد) is applied to a species of cyperus:<br>\
a species thereof is termed by Forskål (in his<br>\
Flora Aegypt. Arab, pp. lx. and 14,) cyperus<br>\
complanatus; and he writes its Arabic name<br>\
“ sæad ” and “ sææd: ”] it has a wonderful efficacy applied to ulcers, or sores, that heal with<br>\
difficulty. (K.)<br>\
سُعُدٌ A certain sort of dates. (K, TA.)<br>\

word of the measure فَعْلَالٌ except خَزْعَالٌ and<br>\
قَهْقَارٌ unless it is of the reduplicative class, (S,)<br>\
A certain plant, (S, K,) growing in the plain, or<br>\
soft, tracts, (TA,) one of the best kinds of the<br>\

S, K,) called حَسَكَةُ السَّعْدَانِ, (T, S,) to which the<br>\
nipple [or the areola] of a woman&#39;s breast is<br>\
likened: (S, K: [see سَعْدَانَةٌ, below:]) the Arabs<br>\
say that the camels that yield the sweetest milk<br>\
are those that eat this plant: (TA:) and they<br>\
fatten upon it: (Az, TA:) it is of the kind of<br>\
plants called أَحْرَار [pl. of حُرٌّ, meaning slender,<br>\
and succulent or soft  or sweet], dust-coloured, and<br>\
sweet, and eaten by everything that is not large,<br>\
[as well as by camels,] and it is one of the most<br>\
wholesome kinds of pasture: (AHn, TA:) it is a<br>\
herb, or leguminous plant, having a round fruit<br>\
with a prickly face, which, when it dries, falls<br>\
upon the ground on its back, and when a person<br>\
walking treads upon it, the prickles wound his<br>\
foot: it is one of the best of their pastures in the<br>\
days of the رِبيع, and sweetens the milk of the<br>\
camels that feed upon it; for it is sweet as long<br>\
as it continues fresh; and in this state men such<br>\
it and eat it: (Az, L:) the n. un. is with ة.<br>\
(TA.) Hence the prov., مَرْعًى وَلَا كَالسَّعْدَانِ<br>\
[Pasture, but not like the سعدان]: (S, K:) said<br>\
of a thing possessing excellence, but surpassed in<br>\
excellence by another thing; or of a thing that<br>\
excels other things of the like kind. (TA.) ―<br>\

irregularly derived from أَسْعَدَهُ, (S, * K * MF,)<br>\
or regularly from سَعَدَهُ: (T, Msb:) one should<br>\

(A, Msb, TA,) and, accord. to Lh, سَعِيدُونَ and<br>\
أَسَاعِدُ; but ISd says, I know not whether he<br>\
