سَمَكَ, [aor.<br>\
سَمُكَ,] inf. n. سُمُوكٌ, It (a thing)<br>\
rose, or became high or elevated or lofty. (S,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, aor. and inf. n. as above, He ascended. (TA.) One says, اُسْمُكْ فِى الرَّيْمِ Ascend<br>\
thou the stairs. (S, TA. [See رَيْمٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  And<br>\
سَمَكَهُ, (S, K,) aor. as above, (TA,) inf. n. سَمْكٌ,<br>\
He raised, elevated, upraised, or uplifted, it. (S,<br>\
K.) So in the phrase, سَمَكَ اللّٰهُ السَّمَآءَ [God<br>\
raised the heaven]. (S.)<br>\
سَمْكٌ The roof of a house, or chamber: (S,<br>\
Mgh, * K: *) or the interior uppermost part [i. e.<br>\
the ceiling] of a house, or chamber; the exterior<br>\
uppermost part thereof being called صَهْوَةٌ: (Ham<br>\
p. 725:) or [the height] from the top to the<br>\
bottom of a house or chamber. (K.) [And<br>\
hence, The canopy of the heaven or sky: or] the<br>\
measure of the height of the heaven from the<br>\
earth: or the thickness thereof, upwards. (Bd in<br>\
lxxix. 28.) And The stature, or height in a<br>\
standing posture, or anything: (K:) thus expl.<br>\
by Lth: one says بِعِيرٌ طَوِيلُ السَّمْكِ [A camel tall<br>\
of stature]. (TA.) [In the present day, it signifies The extent of anything from top to bottom;<br>\
its height, depth, and thickness: and is vulgarly<br>\
pronounced سُمْك.]<br>\
سَمَكٌ Fish; syn. حُوتٌ; (K;) a kind of aquatic<br>\
creatures: [a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. with ة: pl. of<br>\
the former سِمَاكٌ and سُمُوكٌ. (S, TA.) شَوَى<br>\
فِى الحَرِيقِ سَمَكَتَهُ [He broiled his fish in the fire<br>\
of a burning house] is a post-classical prov. of the<br>\
people of Baghdád, relating to the concealing,<br>\
disguising, or cloaking, of a fault, for the purpose<br>\
of seizing an opportunity; orginating from the<br>\
fact that the thief used, when he saw the fire of a<br>\
burning house in a place, to go thither for the<br>\
purpose of theft; and if it were in his power, he<br>\
did what he desired; and if he were lighted on,<br>\
he said, I came to broil a fish. (Mtr, in Har<br>\
pp. 481-2.) ―<br>\
-b2-  السَّمَكَةُ [is a name of (tropical:)  The constellation Pisces; also called السَّمَكَتَانِ;] a certain<br>\
sign of the Zodiac; (K, TA;) thought by ISd to<br>\
be so called because it is a watery sign; and also<br>\
called الحُوتُ. (TA.)<br>\
سِمَاكٌ A thing with which a thing is raised,<br>\
elevated, upraised, or uplifted; (K, TA;) whether<br>\
a wall or a roof: (TA:) pl. سُمُكٌ. (K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
السِّمَاكَانِ is the name of Two bright stars;<br>\
السِّمَاكُ الأَعْزَلُ and السِّمَاكُ الرَّامِحُ: (S, O, K:) the<br>\
former is a star [namely a] in Virgo, called by<br>\
astrologers السُّنْبُلَةُ [or Spica Virginis]; (Kzw;)<br>\
and is one of the Mansions of the Moon, (S, O,<br>\
and Kzw in his descr. of the Mansions of the<br>\
Moon,) the Fourteenth thereof; (Kzw ibid.;) it<br>\
is one of the أَنْوَآء [pl. of نَوْءٌ, q. v.], and rises<br>\
aurorally in تِشْرِينُ الأَوَّلُ [October, O. S.; its<br>\
auroral rising, in Central Arabia, about the commencement of the era of the Flight, began on the<br>\
4th of that month]; it is called الا عزل because it<br>\
has no star [near] before it, like the اعزل that has<br>\
with him no spear; or, as some say, because,<br>\
when it rises [aurorally], it is not accompanied<br>\
by wind nor by cold: (TA:) the latter سِمَاك, i. e.<br>\
الرَّامِحُ, [thus called for a reason expl. in art. رمح,<br>\
q. v., is the star Arcturus, and] is not of the<br>\
Mansions of the Moon, (S, O, TA,) and has not<br>\
any نَوْء [here meaning supposed influence in<br>\
bringing rain &amp;c.]; it is towards the north; the<br>\
former being towards the south; (TA;) and is<br>\
also called السِّمَاكُ المِرْزَمُ: (AZ, TA in art. رمح:)<br>\
[it is erroneously said that] the سماكان are in<br>\
the sign of Libra: (TA:) and it is said that they<br>\
are the two kind legs of Leo (رِجْلَا الأَسَدِ): (S, O,<br>\
K: *) [for it appears, as I have before observed,<br>\
(voce ذِرَاعٌ,) that the ancient Arabs, or many of<br>\
them, extended the figure of Leo (as they did<br>\
also that of Scorpio) far beyond the limits which<br>\
we assign to it: and hence,] السماك الا عزل was<br>\
also called سَاقُ الأَسَدِ [the thigh, or the hind<br>\
shank, of Leo]. (Kzw in his descr. of Virgo.)<br>\
The rhyming-proser says, إِذَا طَلَعَ السِّمَاكْ ذَهَبَ<br>\
العِكَاكْ فَأَصْلِحْ فِنَاكْ وَأَجِدَّ حِذَاكْ فَإِنَّ الشِّتَآءَ قَدْ أَتَاكْ<br>\
[When السماك rises aurorally, (i. e. السماك الا عزل,)<br>\
the sultriness has gone, therefore do thou put thy<br>\
court, or yard, in good condition, and renew thy<br>\
sandal, for the winter has come to thee: فِنَاك and<br>\
حِذَاك being contractions of فِنَآءَك and حِذَآءَك, for<br>\
the sake of the rhyme]. (O, TA.) The نَوْء [here<br>\
app. meaning the rain consequent upon the<br>\
auroral setting] of السماك الاعزل [about the 4th<br>\
of April, O. S. in Central Arabia] is abundant,<br>\
but disapproved, because it gives growth to the<br>\
نَشْر [q. v.], which diseases the camels that pasture<br>\
upon it. (Kzw in his descr. of the Mansions of<br>\
the Moon.) [The epithet ↓ سِمَاكِىٌّ is applied to<br>\
the rain above mentioned.] ―<br>\
-b2-  السِّمَاكُ also signifies, (K,) or سِمَاكُ التَّرْقُوَةِ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,) The<br>\
upper part of the chest, next to the collar-bone.<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
سِمَاكِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
سُمَيْكَآءُ i. q. حُسَاسٌ; (S, O, K;) i. e. Certain<br>\
small fish, which are dried; also called هِفٌّ.<br>\
(O, TA.)<br>\
سَمَّاكٌ A fishmonger. (MA.)<br>\
سَنَامٌ سَامِكٌ A high, (S, TA,) or long and high,<br>\
and plump, (TA,) camel&#39;s hump. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
شَرَفُكَ تَامِكٌ وَإِقْبَالُكَ سَامِكٌ (tropical:)  [Thy nobility is lofty,<br>\
and thy good fortune is high]. (A and Ta in<br>\
art. تمك.)<br>\
المُسْمَكَاتُ The heavens; (K;) which are seven<br>\
in number: (TA:) or so ↓ المَسْمُوكَاتُ: (S:) or<br>\
this is wrong; or it is a dial. var.: (K:) the latter<br>\
word is used by the vulgar, but is correct. (TA.)<br>\
مِسْمَاكٌ A pole of a [tent such as is called] خِبَآء,<br>\
(S, K,) which latter is raised thereby. (S.)<br>\
مَسْمُوكٌ Tall; (IDrd, O, K;) applied to a man.<br>\
(IDrd, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, applied to a horse, [من الحَبْلِ<br>\
in the CK being a mistake for مِنَ الخَيْلِ,]<br>\
(tropical:)  Firm (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, Z, O, K, TA) in the [ribs<br>\
called] جَوَانِح. (Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  المَسْمُوكَاتُ: see<br>\
المُسْمَكَاتُ.<br>\
بَيْتٌ مُسْتَمِكٌ and ↓ مُنْسَمِكٌ A tall house or tent.<br>\
