سَهُمَ; inf. n.<br>\
سُهُومٌ, (S, MA, K,) of both verbs, (S, TA,) and<br>\
of the latter سُهُومَةٌ also, agreeably with analogy;<br>\
(Har p. 449;) He, (a man, TA,) or it, (one&#39;s<br>\
face, S, MA, and Har ubi suprà,) was, or became,<br>\
altered in colour, (MA,) or he was, or became, lean<br>\
or lank, in the belly, and altered [in colour]; (S,<br>\
K, and Har ubi suprà;) [or, accord. to an explanation of سُهُومٌ in the Ham p. 360, he, or it, was,<br>\
or became, altered in colour, and emaciated, and<br>\
dried up;] and سُهِمَ, also, aor. يُسْهَمُ, inf. n. سُهُومٌ,<br>\
has the first of these meanings: (MA:) [see also<br>\
سُهُومٌ below:] or سُهِمَ signifies he (a man) was, or<br>\
became, lean, or lank, in the belly: (TA:) or he<br>\
(a man, S) was, or became, smitten, or affected,<br>\

تَسْهِيمٌ The making a garment to be marked<br>\
with stripes or lines [like سِهَام, i. e. arrows: see<br>\
the pass. part. n. below]. (KL. [And the same<br>\
meaning is indicated in the TA.]) Dhu-r-Rummeh<br>\
says, describing a dwelling, [or rather the traces<br>\
thereof,]<br>\
كَأَنَّهَا بَعْدَ أَحْوَلٍ مَضَيْنَ لَهَا<br>\
بِالأَشْيَمَيْنِ يَمَانٍ فِيهِ تَسْهِيمُ<br>\
[As though it were, after years had passed with<br>\
respect to it, in El-Ashyamán, a garment of<br>\
El-Yemen in which was a marking with stripes<br>\
or lines: the epithet يَمَانٍ being often applied to<br>\
a garment of this kind, and ثَوْبٌ being here<br>\
understood]: (TA:) الأَشْيَمَانِ, or, as some call<br>\
them, الأَشْأَمَانِ, are two places, or two mountains,<br>\
mentioned by Dhu-r-Rummeh in several places<br>\
in his poetry. (TA in art. شيم.)<br>\
3<br>\
ساهمهُ, (S, MA, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. مُسَاهَمَةٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) He shot arrows [سِهَام] with him [in competition]. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] He cast, or<br>\
drew, lots [or more properly arrows for sortilege,<br>\
as expl. in the PS,] with him; practised sortilege<br>\
[or sortilege with arrows] with him; or competed<br>\
with him in doing so. (S, MA, Mgh, Msb.) You<br>\
say, ↓ سَاهَمْتُهُ فَسَهَمْتُهُ; (S;) or سَاهَمَهُمْ فَسَهَمَهُمْ;<br>\
(TA;) aor. of the latter verb<br>\
سَهَمَ, (S,) and inf. n.<br>\
سَهْمٌ; (TA;) I competed with him in casting, or<br>\
drawing, lots [or arrows for sortilege] or in practising sortilege [or sortilege with arrows] with<br>\
him, and overcame him therein; or He did so with<br>\
them, and overcame them therein. (S, * TA.)<br>\
Hence, فَسَاهَمَ in the Kur xxxvii. 141, (TA,)<br>\
where [the objective complement] أَهْلَ السَّفِينَةِ is<br>\
understood. (Jel.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence, He shared<br>\
with him, فِى كَذَا in such a thing. See an ex.<br>\
voce مُشِدٌّ, and another voce نَاوَبَ. ―<br>\
-b4-  And app.<br>\
He contended with him for a thing: see 6.]<br>\
4<br>\
اسهم بَيْنَهُمْ i. q. أَقْرَعَ [i. e. He ordered, or<br>\
commanded, them to cast, or draw, lots, or to<br>\
practise sortilege, or sortilege with arrows, among<br>\
themselves, for a thing; or he prepared, or disposed, them for doing so; or he cast, or drew,<br>\
lots, or practised sortilege, or sortilege with arrows,<br>\
among them: see أَقْرَعَ]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And أَسْهَمْتُ لَهُ I<br>\
gave him a lot, share, or portion. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
And أَسْهَمَ is syn. with أَسْهَبَ, (K, TA,) meaning<br>\
He was, or became, loquacious, or profuse of<br>\
speech: its م is said by Yaakoob to be a substitute for ب. (TA.) [See also مُسْهَمٌ, below.]<br>\
6<br>\
تساهموا: see 8. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, They shared<br>\
together.] El-Hakam El-Khudree says,<br>\
ثَوْبَاهَا فَفِى الدِّرْعِ رَادَةٌ تَسَاهَمَ<br>\
وَفَى المِرْطِ لَفَّاوَانِ رِدْفُهُمَا عَبْلُ<br>\
i. e. Her two garments shared together; for in<br>\
the shift was a soft, or tender, body, with a slender<br>\
waist, and within the waist-wrapper were too<br>\
thick thighs whereof the part above them, behind,<br>\
was large. (Ham p. 579.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also They contended [for a thing], one with another. (JM.)<br>\
8<br>\
استهموا (S, Msb) and ↓ تساهموا (S) They<br>\
cast, or drew, lots, or practised sortilege, [or<br>\
sortilege with arrows,] one with another; syn.<br>\
اقترعوا (S, Msb) and تقارعوا, (S,) both of which<br>\
signify the same. (S &amp;c. in art. قرع.)<br>\
سَهْمٌ An arrow; i. e. one of what are called<br>\
نَبْل, (Msb, K, TA,) having the iron head [and<br>\
the feathers] affixed: (TA:) the سَهْم before it<br>\
has its feathers and its iron head affixed to it is<br>\
[generally] called قِدْحٌ: (S and K in art. قدح:)<br>\
accord. to some it signifies the iron head itself;<br>\
i. q. نَصْلٌ; (Msb;) ISh says that this is its meaning; and he says, if one pick up a نصل, you say<br>\
“ What is this سَهْم with thee? ” but if one pick<br>\
up a قِدْح, you do not say thus; and the نَصْل is<br>\
the broad and long سَهْم, and may be nearly of the<br>\
length of the space between the extremity of the<br>\
thumb and that of the fore finger when they are<br>\
stretched out; and the مِشْقَص is of half the size<br>\
of the نَصْل: (TA:) [but this meaning of سَهْمٌ<br>\
seems to be very rare, and little known:] the pl.<br>\
[of mult.] is سِهَامٌ (S, TA) and [of pauc.] أَسْهُمٌ.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence,] سَهْمُ الرَّامِى (assumed tropical:)  [The arrow of the<br>\
archer], (K,) or [simply] السَّهْمُ [the arrow],<br>\
(Kzw,) a certain constellation, (K, * Kzw,) [namely<br>\
Sagitta,] one of the northern constellations, composed of five stars, between the bill [meaning the<br>\
star<br>\
β] of الدَّجَاجَةُ [which is Cygnus] and النَّسْرُ<br>\
الطَّائرُ [which consists of the stars<br>\
α and<br>\
β and<br>\
γ<br>\
of Aquila], in the Great Milky Way, having its<br>\
head towards the east and its notch towards the<br>\
west; and its length, as it appears to the eye,<br>\
when it is in the middle of the sky, is about two<br>\
cubits (نَحْوُ ذِرَاعَيْنِ: see ذِرَاعٌ). (Kzw.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
The قِدْح [or featherless and headless arrow] with<br>\
which one casts, or draws, lots, (IAth, Mgh, TA,)<br>\
in the game called المَيْسِر; (IAth, Mgh, TA;) and the<br>\
قِدْح with which one plays at a game of hazard<br>\
[of any kind; i. e. an arrow for sortilege, and a<br>\
gaming-arrow]; the primary meaning of the<br>\
word being the missile سَهْم; (Mgh;) or the primary meaning is the قِدْح with which one casts,<br>\
or draws, lost in the game called المَيْسِر: (IAth,<br>\
TA:) pl. سِهَامٌ (K) [and أَسْهُمٌ, as above]. See a<br>\
verse cited voce رَقِيبٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  Then applied to The<br>\
thing won by him whose arrow is successful [in<br>\
the game above mentioned]. (IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
then (IAth, TA) applied also to A lot, share, or<br>\
portion, (S, IAth, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,) whatever<br>\
it be; (IAth, TA;) as also ↓ سُهْمَةٌ: (S, Msb, K:)<br>\
pl. of the former سُهْمَانٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and<br>\
سِهَامٌ [both pls. of mult.] and أَسْهُمٌ [pl. of pauc.]<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, TA) and [quasi-pl. n.] ↓ سُهْمَةٌ, (M,<br>\
K, TA,) this last like أُخْوَةٌ. (TA.) It is said in<br>\
a trad., كَانَ لَهُ سَهْمٌ مِنَ الغَنِيمَةِ شَهِدَ أَوْ غَابَ<br>\
[There was, or is, for him a share of the spoil<br>\
whether he were, or be, present or absent]. (TA.)<br>\
And one says, فُلَانٍ مِنْ هٰذَا كَذَا ↓ سُهْمَةُ The<br>\
share of such a one, of this, is such a thing: and<br>\
it may be from السِّهَامُ meaning the arrows (قِدَاح)<br>\
that are shuffled among the persons competing in<br>\
sortilege, in order that each one may appropriate<br>\
to himself what comes forth for him as his share.<br>\
(Ham p. 579.) ―<br>\
-b5-  سَهْمُ السَّفِينَةِ [The mast of the<br>\
ship: so called as being likened to an arrow,<br>\
because the curved yard of the sail, resembling a<br>\
bow, is suspended from the top]: (S, and K in<br>\
art. دقل:) [in like manner] called in Pers.<br>\
تِيرِ كِشْتِى. (PS in that art.) ―<br>\
-b6-  سَهْمُ البَيْتِ The<br>\

cubits [as used] in men&#39;s sales and purchases in<br>\
their measurings of land. (K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And A stone<br>\

constructed for the purpose of capturing therein<br>\
the lion, so that, when he enters it, it falls upon the<br>\

substance termed gossamer,] with the article ال,<br>\
i. q. غَزْلُ عَيْنِ الشَّمْسِ [lit. the spun-thread of the<br>\
rays of the sun]: (IAar, K:) and ↓ سَهَامٌ [signifies the same], with the article ال i. q. مُخَاطُ<br>\

-b3-  And see what<br>\
next follows.<br>\
سُهَامٌ (S, K) and ↓ سَهَامٌ, (K, and only thus in<br>\
some copies of the K,) the former mentioned by<br>\
several authors, (TA,) Leanness, or lankness in<br>\
the belly, and an altered state (S, K, TA) of the<br>\
colour, and dryness of the lips. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
the former, [in some copies of the K the latter,<br>\
but the former, as is said in the TA, is the right,<br>\
agreeably with analogy as a word signifying a<br>\

(El-Umawee, S, K.)<br>\
سَهُومٌ, with fet-h [to the س, by Freytag erroneously written سَهَوْمٌ, in consequence of his<br>\

horses were altered in their complexions in consequence of the state of difficulty wherein they<br>\
were [as though they, i. e. the riders thereof, were<br>\

[Sons of Yethribee, keep ye your she-camels and<br>\

equals. (TA.) ―<br>\
