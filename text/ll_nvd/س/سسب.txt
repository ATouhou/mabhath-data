load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'سسبسَاسَبٌ and ↓ سَيْسَبٌ, (M, K,) i. q. سَبْسَبٌ, with<br>\
two ب s, (L, TA,) the second of which is commonly pronounced سِيسب, and by some سيسم,<br>\
(TA,) A kind of tree, (M, K,) a kind of lofty<br>\
tree, (TA,) of which arrows are made, (M, K,<br>\
TA,) and bows. (TA.) In the saying of Rubeh,<br>\
↓ رَاحَتْ وَرَاحَ كَعِصِىِّ السَّيْسَابٌ<br>\
[She went, and he went, like the rods of the<br>\
seysáb, (of which see another reading voce<br>\
سَبْسَبٌ, in art. سب,) meaning, like arrows], it<br>\
may be that السيساب is a dial. var. of السَّيْسَب, or<br>\
it may be that the ا is added for the sake of the<br>\
rhyme like as it is in العَقْرَاب in a verse cited in<br>\
art. عقرب. (M. [Accord. to the K and TA,<br>\
↓ السَّيْسَاب is used by Ru-beh for السَّيْسَبَان: but<br>\
this is evidently a mistake.])<br>\
سَيْسَبٌ: see the preceding paragraph: ―<br>\
-b2-  and<br>\
see also سَيْسَبَانٌ.<br>\
سَيْسَبَا, and سَيْسَبَى, and سَيْسَبًى, and سَيْسَبَآءُ:<br>\
see the paragraph that next follows.<br>\
سَيْسَبَانٌ and ↓ سَيْسَبَى, (K,) or the former and<br>\
↓ سَيْسَبَآءُ, which is mentioned by Th, (M,) A<br>\
kind of tree; (M, K;) accord. to AHn, it grows<br>\
from its seeds, and becomes tall, but does not<br>\
endure the winter; it has leaves like those of the<br>\
دِفْلَى [q. v.], beautiful; people sow it in the<br>\
gardens, desiring its beauty; and it has a produce like the oblong pericarps (خَرَائِط) of sesame,<br>\
but thinner: (M, TA:) AHn adds that, when its<br>\
pericarps dry, it makes a rustling sound (a sound<br>\
such as is termed خَشْخَشَة) [in the wind], like the<br>\
[species of cassia called] عِشْرِق: (TA:) [the<br>\
sesbania Aegytiaca of Persoon; æschynomene<br>\
sesban of Linn.; (Delile, Flor. Aegypt. Illustr.,<br>\
no. 682;) dolichos sesban of Forskål (in his Flora<br>\
Aegypt. Arab, p. lxx., no. 362):] AHn further<br>\
says, وَحَكَى الفَرَّآءُ فِيهِ سَيْسَبًا: (M, TA:) [this may<br>\
perhaps mean that Fr has mentioned, as a var. of<br>\
this word, ↓ سَيْسَبٌ, as it is in the accus. case:<br>\
but I think that the right reading is ↓ سَيْسَبًى, and<br>\
also سَيْسَبَى, (which last has been mentioned<br>\
above on the authority of the K,) for it is immediately added in the TA, “it is masc. and<br>\
fem.,” app. indicating that it is with, and without, tenween: then it is there further and strangely<br>\
added, “it is brought from India: ”] a rájiz uses<br>\
the form ↓ السَّيْسَبَا, at the end of a verse, for<br>\
السَّيْسَبَانَ, necessarily eliding [the ن for the sake<br>\
of the rhyme]. (M, TA.)<br>\
سَيْسَابٌ: see the first paragraph, in two places.<br>\
