which is of the latter verb, (M, Msb,) and سَبَاطَةٌ<br>\

سِبْطٌ A grandchild; (S, Msb, K;) a son&#39;s child,<br>\
and a daughter&#39;s child: (M, TA:) pl. أَسْبَاطٌ; (S,<br>\
Msb, TA;) which is commonly used by the vulgar<br>\
as signifying daughters&#39; children; distinguished by<br>\
them from أَحْفَادٌ [which they apply to son&#39;s children, pl. of حَفِيدٌ]; but the leading lexicologists<br>\
expressly declare that it includes sons&#39; children<br>\
and daughters&#39; children, as it is said to do by ISd:<br>\
IAar explained سِبْطٌ and سِبْطَانِ and أَسْبَاطٌ as<br>\
signifying the particularly distinguished, and<br>\
choicest, of children. (TA.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
(TA,) الحَسَنُ وَالحُسَيْنُ سِبْطَا رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ El-Hasan,<br>\
and El-Hoseyn are the two grandsons of the<br>\
Apostle of God. (M, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  A tribe of the<br>\
Jews: pl. أَسْبَاطٌ: (M, Msb, K:) سِبْطٌ (M) and<br>\
أَسْبَاطٌ (S, Msb) in relation to the Jews, (M, Msb,)<br>\
or [rather] the Children of Israel, (S,) being like<br>\
قَبِيلَةٌ (M) and قَبَائِلُ (S, Msb) in relation to the<br>\
Arabs: (S, M, Msb:) and the former are thus<br>\
called to distinguish them from the children of<br>\
Ishmael. (M, TA.) In the phrase, وَقَطَّعْنَاهُمُ اثْنَتَىْ<br>\
عَشْرَةَ أَسْبَاطًا [And we divided them into twelve<br>\
divisions, tribes], (S, M, K,) in the Kur [vii. 160],<br>\
(S, M,) اسباطا is a substitute (S, M, K) for اثنتى<br>\
عشرة, (S, M,) not a specificative, (S, M, K,) because the specificative may only be a sing.; (S,<br>\
M;) the meaning being وقطّعناهم اثنتى عشرة فِرْقَةً<br>\
اسباطًا, (Akh, Zj, S,) and therefore the numeral is<br>\
fem.; (Akh, S;) or this is a mistake; for it should<br>\
be فِرَقًا اثنتى عشرة; and therefore the numeral is<br>\
fem. (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, TA.) Accord. to Ktr, you<br>\
say, هٰذَا سِبْطٌ and هٰذِهِ سِبْطٌ, and هٰؤُلَآءِ سِبْطٌ and using<br>\
سبط as a pl., meaning فِرْقَةٌ. (TA.) The saying<br>\
كَأَنَّهُ سِبْطٌ مِنَ الأَسْبَاطِ<br>\
is [asserted to be] a mistake, inasmuch as its<br>\
author imagined that سِبْطٌ meant a man: (M:)<br>\
IDrd ascribes it to El-&#39;Ajjáj or Ru-beh: it occurs<br>\
in an أُرْجُوزَة by the latter. (Sgh, TA.) [But it is<br>\
applied to a single man: for] it is said in a trad.,<br>\
(TA,) حُسَيْنٌ سِبْطٌ مِنَ الأَسْبَاطِ, i. e. Hoseyn is [as<br>\
though he were] a nation of the nations (أُمَّةٌ مِنَ<br>\
الأُمَمِ K) in goodness; so expl. by Aboo-Bekr:<br>\
(TA:) or one of the fathers of tribes; because of<br>\
the multitude of his descendants: or one of the<br>\
sons of daughters. (So in a marginal note in a copy<br>\
of the “ Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer ” of Es-Suyootee.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also A generation (قَرْن) that comes after another.<br>\
(Zj, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And سِبْطٌ رِبْعِيَّةٌ, (TA in the present<br>\
art. and in art. ربع,) or رِبْعِيَّةٌ ↓ سَبَطٌ, (so accord.<br>\
to a copy of the M, in the present art.,) A palmtree of which the fruit ripens in the end of the<br>\
summer, or hot-season. (M, TA.)<br>\
سَبَطٌ: see the next paragraph, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also Such as is fresh of the [plant called] حَلِىّ;<br>\
one of the plants of the sands; (M;) [i. e.] the<br>\
[plant called] نَصِىّ, while fresh; (A&#39;Obeyd, S,<br>\
O, K;) when it has dried up, called حَلِىّ;<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, S, O;) a plant like the ثِيل [q. v.],<br>\
except that it becomes tall; growing in the sands:<br>\
(Lth, TA:) n. un. with ة: (Lth, S:) it is one of<br>\
those that, when they dry up, become white, [as is<br>\
said of the حَلِىّ,] resembling hoariness, like the<br>\
ثُمَام [or panic grass]: (AHn, O: in the TA, the<br>\
نَمَّام:) it is asserted that the Arabs say, “The<br>\
صِلِّيَان is the bread of the camels, and the سَبَط is<br>\
their خَبِيص: ” (AHn, O:) its manner of growth<br>\
is like [that of] دُخْن [q. v.]; and it is a good<br>\
pasture: (K:) AHn says, a desert-Arab, of<br>\
&#39;Anazeh, told me that its manner of growth is<br>\
like that of large دُخْن, falling short of [so I<br>\
render دُونَ, but this also signifies exceeding,] ذُرَة<br>\
[q. v.], and it has grain like the grain termed بَزْر<br>\
[q. v.], which will not come forth from its envelopes but by bruising, or pounding, and men<br>\
extract it and eat it, made into bread, and cooked:<br>\
(M, O:) the n. un. is with ة: and the pl. is أَسْبَاطٌ.<br>\
(M.) Also The tree that has many branches and<br>\
one أَصْل [meaning stem]: (K:) so says Az.;<br>\
adding that hence is derived أَسْبَاطٌ [pl. of سِبْطٌ];<br>\
as though the father represented the tree and the<br>\
children represented the branches: (TA: [but<br>\
this is questionable:]) accord. to Abo-Ziyád, a<br>\
certain tree, (AHn, M, O,) growing in the sands,<br>\
(AHn, O,) tall, having slender branches, eaten by<br>\
the camels and the sheep or goats, (AHn, M, O,)<br>\
and collected by men, who sell it upon the roads<br>\
(عَلَى الطُّرُقِ), (AHn, O,) or with the tamarisk<br>\
(مَعَ الطَّرْفَآءِ); (so in the TA;) without blossom<br>\
and without thorns, having thin leaves of the size<br>\
of [those of] the كُرَّاث [or leek] (AHn, M, O)<br>\
when this first comes forth. (AHn, O.) ―<br>\

Arab. (TA.) ―<br>\
