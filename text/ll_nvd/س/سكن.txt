سَكَنَ, (S, Mgh, L, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
سَكُنَ, (L,)<br>\
inf. n. سُكُونٌ, (S, Mgh, L, Msb, K,) said of a<br>\
thing, (S, L,) of a thing that moves, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
It was, or became, still, motionless, stationary, in<br>\
a state of rest, quiet, calm, or unruffled, (هَدَأَ,<br>\
Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, L, or قَرَّ, K,) after motion; (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, L;) its motion [ceased, or] went away;<br>\
(L, Msb;) and in like manner said of a man, and<br>\
of a beast: (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, L:) and said of anything such as wind and heat and cold and the<br>\
like; of rain; [and of pain;] and of anger;<br>\
[&amp;c.;] it was, or became, still, calm, tranquillized, appeased, allayed, assuaged, or quelled; [it<br>\
died away, passed away, or ceased to be: and it<br>\
remitted, or subsided; became alleviated, light,<br>\
slight, or gentle:] and said of a man [or beast or<br>\
the like, and of a voice or sound], he [or it] was,<br>\
or became, still, or silent. (L.) [Hence,] one<br>\
says, سَكَنَ الدَّمْعُ, and الدَّمُ, meaning رَقَأَ [The<br>\
tears, and the blood, stopped, or ceased to flow].<br>\
(S and Mgh in art. رقاٌ.) [And one says of heat,<br>\
and cold, and pain, &amp;c., سَكَنَ عَنْهُ It passed away<br>\
from him; quitted him. And سَكَنَتِ النَّارُ The<br>\
fire became extinguished; or became allayed or<br>\
assuaged; subsided; or ceased to flame or blaze<br>\
or burn fiercely,] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence also, It (a letter)<br>\
was or became, quiescent; i. e., without a vowel<br>\
immediately following it; contr. of تَحَرَّكَ.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And سَكَنَ إِلَيْهِ, (Msb, [where the aor. is said to<br>\
be<br>\
سَكِنَ, but this is either a mistake or rare, for the<br>\
aor. accord. to common usage is<br>\
سَكُنَ, as in the Kur<br>\
vii.] 189 and xxx. 20,]) inf. n. سُكُونٌ (Mgh, Msb)<br>\
and سَكَنٌ, (Msb,) He trusted to it, or relied upon<br>\
it, so as to be, or become, easy, or quiet, in mind;<br>\
i. q. رَكَنَ إِلَيْهِ; (S and K &amp;c. in art. ركن;) and<br>\
اِطْمَأَنَّ إِلَيْهِ; (TA in art. طمن;) [and اِعْتَمَدَ عَلَيْهِ;<br>\
and وَثِقَ بِهِ; &amp;c.; and he inclined to it; syn.<br>\
مَالَ إِلَيْهِ; and became familiar with it; syn.<br>\
اِسُتَأْنَسَ بِهِ, and أَلِفَ; agreeably with explanations<br>\
here following;] namely, a thing: (Msb:) and<br>\
سَكَنَ إِلَيْهَا, aor.<br>\
سَكُنَ, he trusted to her, or relied upon<br>\
her, so as to be, or become, easy, or quiet, in<br>\
mind; &amp;c., as above; syn. اِطْمَأَنَّ إِلَيْهَا; (Ksh<br>\
and Bd in vii. 189, and Ksh in xxx. 20;) and<br>\
مَالَ إِلَيْهَا; (Ksh in vii. 189, and the same and<br>\
Bd in xxx. 20;) and اِسْتَأْنَسَ بِهَا, and أَلِفَ; (Bd<br>\
in the same two places;) namely, his wife. (Ksh<br>\
and Bd.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And سَكَنَ الَّدارَ, (S, MA, Mgh, L,<br>\
Msb, K,) and فِى الدَّارِ, (Mgh, Msb,) and بِالمَكَانِ,<br>\
(L,) aor.<br>\
سَكُنَ, (L, Msb, JM,) inf. n. سُكْنَى (MA,<br>\
Mgh, L, JM) and سُكُونٌ (MA, L) and سُكْنٌ,<br>\
(MA,) or ↓ سُكْنَى is a simple subst., and the<br>\
inf. n. is سكن, (Msb, [accord. to which the latter<br>\
is app. سَكَنٌ, for it is there said that the verb in<br>\
this case is like طَلَبَ, the unaugmented inf. n. of<br>\
which is طَلَبٌ, but this inf. n. سَكَنُ I have not<br>\
found elsewhere, and what is generally used as<br>\
the inf. n. or quasi-inf. n. of the verb in this case<br>\
is ↓ سُكْنَى,]) or ↓ سُكْنَى is a subst. in the sense of<br>\
إِسْكَانٌ, as expl. below, (Mgh,) [or rather it is also<br>\
a subst. in this sense,] He inhabited, or dwelt or<br>\
abode in, the house [and the place]. (MA, Mgh.)<br>\
وَلَهُ مَا سَكَنَ فِى اللَّيْلِ وَالنَّهَارِ, in the Kur [vi. 13],<br>\
is from السُّكْنَى (Ksh, Bd) or from السُّكُونُ: (Bd:)<br>\
if from the former, (Ksh, Bd,) it signifies To<br>\
Him belongeth what taketh up its abode in the<br>\
night and the day; (IAar, Ksh, * Bd, * L, Jel;)<br>\
meaning, what the night and the day include<br>\
within their limits: (Ksh, * Bd:) or, if from<br>\
السُّكُونُ, (Bd,) what is still, or motionless, (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, Bd, L,) and what moves; one of the<br>\
two contraries being mentioned as sufficient [to<br>\
show what is intended] without the other; (Bd;)<br>\
app. meaning the creation, collectively, or all<br>\
created beings. (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And سَكَنَ,<br>\
(L, K,) aor.<br>\
سَكُنَ, (K,) He became such as is termed<br>\
مِسْكِين [q. v.]; (L, K;) as also سَكُنَ, (K,) and<br>\
↓ اسكن, and ↓ تسكّن, and ↓ تَمَسْكَنَ: (L, K:) and<br>\
[thus it means particularly] he was, or became,<br>\
lowly, humble, or submissive; and low, abject,<br>\
abased, and weak; as also ↓ اسكن, (L,) and<br>\
↓ تسكّن, and ↓ تَمَسْكَنَ; (S, * L;) the former of<br>\
these being the regular form, (S, L,) and the<br>\
more common and more chaste; (L;) the latter<br>\
of them anomalous, [from المِسْكِينُ,] like تَمَنْدَلَ<br>\
from المِنْدِيلُ, and تَمَدْرَعَ from المِدْرَعَةُ; (S, L;)<br>\
and ↓ استكن, (L, Msb,) and ↓ اِسْتَكَانَ, of the<br>\
measure اِفْتَعَلَ (L, Msb, K) from المَسْكَنَةُ (L, K)<br>\
or from السُّكُونُ, (Msb,) with ا added, (L, Msb,)<br>\
the vowel of the medial radical letter being thus<br>\
rendered full in sound, (L, Msb, K,) or it is of<br>\
the measure اِسْتَفْعَلَ from الكِينَةُ, signifying “ evil<br>\
state or condition,” (Msb,) or from الكَيْنُ signifying “ the [piece of] flesh in the interior of the<br>\
vulva,” because he who is lowly and abject is the<br>\
most obscure of mankind. (L. [See also arts.<br>\
كون and كين.])<br>\
2<br>\
سكّنهُ, (S, L, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَسْكِينٌ, (S, L,<br>\
K,) He, or it, caused it to be, or become, still,<br>\
motionless, stationary, in a state of rest, quiet,<br>\
calm, or unruffled; (S, * L, Msb, K;) namely, a<br>\
thing: (S, L, Msb:) [and caused it, namely,<br>\
anything such as wind, and heat, and cold, and<br>\
the like, as rain, and pain, and anger, to be, or<br>\
become, still, or calm; stilled, calmed, tranquillized, appeased, allayed, assuaged, or quelled, it;<br>\
caused it to die away, pass away, or cease to be:<br>\
and caused it to remit, or subside; to become<br>\
alleviated, light, slight, or gentle: and caused<br>\
him, and it, namely, a man or beast or the like,<br>\
and a voice or sound, to become still, or silent:<br>\
(see 1, first sentence:)] and ↓ اسكنهُ signifies the<br>\
same. (L.) [Hence,] one says of God, سكّن<br>\
دَمْعَهُ, meaning أَرْقَأَهُ [He caused his tears to stop,<br>\
or cease flowing]. (S and TA in art. رقأ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And<br>\
hence, He made it (a letter) quiescent; i. e., made<br>\
it to be without a vowel immediately following<br>\
it; contr. of حَرَّكَهُ.]<br>\
-A2-  تَسْكِينٌ also signifies The<br>\
straightening a cane, or spear, (صَعْدَة,) with fire<br>\
[which is termed السَّكَن]. (IAar, L, K.)<br>\
-A3-  And<br>\
The constantly riding a light and swift ass<br>\
which is termed سُكَيْن. (IAar, L, K.)<br>\
3<br>\
ساكنهُ, inf. n. مُسَاكَنَةٌ, i. q. جَاوَرَهُ [meaning<br>\
He lived in his neighbourhood, or near to him].<br>\
(TA in art. جور.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسكن: see 1, near the end, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  اسكنهُ: see 2, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] said<br>\
of poverty, It made him to be little, or seldom, in<br>\
motion. (Aboo-Is-hák, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, said of<br>\
God, He made him to be such as is termed<br>\
مِسْكِين [q. v.]. (L, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And اسكنهُ الدَّارَ, (S, L,<br>\
Msb, K,) or المَنْزِلَ, (MA,) He made him [or<br>\
gave him] to inhabit the house, or abode; (S, *<br>\
MA, L, * Msb, * K; *) he lodged him therein.<br>\
(MA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تسكّن, said of a man, is from السَّكِينَةُ [i. e.<br>\
He had, or possessed, or affected, the quality thus<br>\
termed; meaning he was, or became, or affected<br>\
to be, calm, tranquil, grave, staid, steady, or<br>\
sedate; &amp;c.]. (L.) See also Q. Q. 2, below:<br>\
and see 1, above, near the end, in two places.<br>\
8<br>\
استكن, and its var. or syn. اِسْتَكَانَ: see 1,<br>\
near the end.<br>\
Q. Q. 2<br>\
تَمَسْكَنَ He affected to be like, or he<br>\
imitated, such as are termed مَسَاكِين [pl. of<br>\
مِسْكِينٌ, q. v.]. (IAth, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, near<br>\
the end, in two places. You say, تَمَسْكَنَ لِرَبِهِ<br>\
He humbled, or abased, himself to his Lord; or<br>\
addressed himself with earnest, or energetic, supplication to Him: and ↓ تسكّن is like تَمَسْكَنَ.<br>\
(Lh, L.)<br>\
سَكْنٌ, a quasi-pl. n. of ↓ سَاكِنٌ, like as شَرْبٌ is<br>\
of شَارِبٌ, called by Akh a pl., (L,) The inhabitants, people, or family, of a house or tent; (S,<br>\
L, K;) a household. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The collective<br>\
body of the people of a tribe: one says, تَحَمَّلَ<br>\
السَّكْنُ فَذَهَبُوا [The collective body of the people<br>\
of the tribe bound the loads, or burdens, upon<br>\
their beasts, and went away]. (Lh, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See<br>\
also سَكَنٌ. ―<br>\
-b4-  And see the paragraph here next<br>\
following.<br>\
سُكْنٌ: see سُكْنَى. ―<br>\
-b2-  And see also مَسْكَنٌ, in<br>\
three places. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (L, JM, [thus written in<br>\
both, and expressly said in the latter to be “ with<br>\
damm,”]) or ↓ سَكَنٌ, (thus in copies of the K,)<br>\
or ↓ سَكْنٌ, (thus in the CK,) [but the first is app.<br>\
the right,] Food, aliment, or victuals, syn. قُوتٌ;<br>\
(L, K, JM;) like نُزْلٌ meaning “ food (طَعَام, L,<br>\
JM) of a party alighting to partake of it,” and<br>\
said to be called سُكْنٌ because by means of it a<br>\
place is inhabited, like as the نُزْل of an army<br>\
means the “ appointed rations of an army alighting<br>\
at a place. ” (L.)<br>\
سَكَنٌ A thing, (S, L, Msb, K,) of any kind,<br>\
(S, L,) to which one trusts, or upon which one<br>\
relies, so as to be, or become, easy, or quiet, in<br>\
mind; (S, L, Msb, K;) and in like manner, a<br>\
person, or persons, to whom one trusts, &amp;c.:<br>\
applied in this sense to a family, or wife, (L,<br>\
Msb,) as well as to property, (Msb,) &amp;c.: (L,<br>\
Msb:) and hence [particularly] signifying a<br>\
wife. (L.) One says, [app. using it in this sense,<br>\
as seems to be indicated by the context in the S,]<br>\
فُلَانٌ أْبْنُ السَّكَنِ [Such a one is the son of the<br>\
سَكَن]; and As used to say ↓ السَّكْنِ: (S, L:)<br>\
accord. to Ibn-Habeeb, one says سَكَن and سَكْن.<br>\
(L.) And it is said in the Kur [vi. 96], جَعَلَ<br>\
أْللَّيْلَ سَكَنًا He hath made, or appointed, the<br>\
night to be a resource for ease, or quiet. (L.)<br>\
And in the same [ix. 104], إِنَّ صَلَوَاتِكَ سَكَنٌ لَهُمْ,<br>\
i. e. [Verily thy prayers for forgiveness are] a cause<br>\
of ease, or quiet, to them. (Zj, L.) [And ↓ سُكْنَةٌ<br>\
seems to have a similar meaning: for] ISh says,<br>\
تَغْطِيَةُ الوَجْهِ عِنْدَ النَّوْمِ سُكْنَةٌ, app. [The covering<br>\
of the face on the occasion of sleep is a cause of<br>\
ease, or quiet,] in the case of loneliness, or of fear<br>\
arising therefrom. (L.) And it is said in a trad.,<br>\
اَللّٰهُمَّ أَنْزِلْ عَلَيْنَا فِى أَرْضِنا سَكَنَهَا, meaning O God,<br>\
send down upon us, in our land, the succour, or<br>\
relief, of its inhabitants, [app. alluding to rain,]<br>\
to which they may trust so as to be easy, or quiet,<br>\
in mind. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q. مَسْكِنٌ. (Lh, L, and<br>\
Ham p. 400.) See the latter word, in three places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And Fire; [app. first applied thereto as being<br>\
a cause of ease, or comfort;] (S, L, K;) as in the<br>\
saying [of a rájiz],<br>\
وَسَكَنٍ تُوقَدُ فِىمِظَلَّهْ<br>\
[And a fire kindled in a large tent of hair-cloth,<br>\
or in a booth, or shed], (S, L,) describing himself<br>\
as driven to have recourse thereto by the night,<br>\
and by a moist wind, or a wind cold with<br>\
moisture; and [afterwards used without any<br>\
allusion to its being a cause of ease, or comfort,]<br>\
as in the saying of another, describing a cane,<br>\
أَقَامَهَا بِسَكَنٍ وَأَدْهَانْ<br>\
meaning He straightened it with fire and oils.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And Mercy, pity, or compassion. (K,<br>\
[See also سَكِينَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  And i. q. بَرَكَةٌ [A blessing;<br>\
prosperity, or good fortune; increase; &amp;c.].<br>\
(K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also سُكْنٌ:<br>\
-A3-  and سُكْنَى:<br>\
-A4-  and<br>\
see سَآكِنٌ.<br>\
[<br>\
سَكْنَةٌ A quiescence of a letter; its having no<br>\
vowel immediately following; opposed to حَرَكَةٌ:<br>\
pl. سَكَنَاتٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  تَرَكْتُهُمْ عَلَى سَكَنَاتِهِمْ: see سَكِنَةٌ.<br>\
سُكْنَةٌ: see سَكَنٌ.<br>\
سَكِنَةٌ A place; [properly] a place of habitation<br>\
or abode: pl. سَكِنَاتٌ. (L.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
اِسْتَقِرُّوا عَلَى سَكِنَاتِكُمْ فَقَدِ انْقَطَعَتِ الهِجْرَةُ, (S, L,<br>\
K, *) i. e. Rest ye, or remain ye, at your places,<br>\
(S, L,) or in your places of habitation or abode,<br>\
(S, L, K,) for emigration has [ended, having]<br>\
become no longer needful. (L.) And one says,<br>\
النَّاسُ عَلَى سَكِنَاتِهِمْ, [virtually] meaning, accord.<br>\
to Fr, The people are in their right state: (S,<br>\
L:) and in like manner is expl. the saying,<br>\
تَرَكْتُهُمْ عَلَى سَكِنَاتِهِمْ and ↓ سَكَنَاتِهِمْ and نَزَلَاتِهِمْ;<br>\
but the approved explanation is, [I left them] at<br>\
their places of habitation, which is that of Th;<br>\
or, as in the M, their places of alighting, or<br>\
abode. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The part, of the neck, which<br>\
is the resting-place of the head. (S, L, K.) So in<br>\
the saying, (S, L,) attributed to several poets, (L,)<br>\
بِضَرْبِ يُزِيلُ الهَامَ عَنْ سَكِنَاتِهِ<br>\
[With a smiting that removes the heads from<br>\
their resting-places on the necks]. (S, L.)<br>\
سُكْنَى is an inf. n. of سَكَنَ in the phrase سَكَنَ<br>\
الدَّارَ: (MA, Mgh, L, JM:) or a simple subst.<br>\
therefrom: (Msb:) or a subst. in the sense of<br>\
إِسْكَانٌ, like رُقْبَى in the sense of إِرْقَابٌ: (Mgh:)<br>\
see 1, in three places: or it is a subst. (S, L, K)<br>\
also (L) from أَسْكَنَهُ الدَّارَ, (S, L, K,) like as عُتْبَى<br>\
is from إِعْتَابٌ, (S, L,) and so is ↓ سَكَنٌ, (Lh, L,<br>\
K,) [which is app. mentioned in the Msb as an<br>\
inf. n. of the former verb,] signifying, as also<br>\
↓ سُكْنٌ, [so in one place, as on the authority of<br>\
Lth, in the L, and said in the MA to be, like<br>\
سُكْنَى, an inf. n. of the verb first mentioned above,]<br>\
The making [or giving] a man a place, or an<br>\
abode, to inhabit, without rent; (L, and Ham<br>\
p. 400 in explanation of the first of these words;)<br>\
the term سُكْنَى being similar to عُمْرَى. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also مَسْكَنٌ, in five places.<br>\
سُكَيْنٌ An ass light, or active, and quick, or<br>\
swift: and سُكَيْنَةٌ is applied to a she-ass (L, K)<br>\
in the same sense. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the latter is<br>\
used as a name for (assumed tropical:)  A girl, or young woman, or a<br>\
female slave, that is of a light, or an active,<br>\
spirit. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The former also signifies A wild<br>\
ass. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And السُّكَيْنَةُ is the name of The<br>\
gnat that entered into the nose of Numrood [or<br>\
Nimrod]. (L, K.)<br>\
سَكِينَةٌ (S, L, Msb, K) and ↓ سِكِّينَةٌ (Ks, L, K)<br>\
and ↓ سَكِّينَةٌ, (L, Msb,) mentioned in the “ Nawádir,” (Msb,) on the authority of AZ, (L,) but<br>\
of a measure of which there is no [other] known<br>\
instance, (L, Msb,) Calmness, or tranquillity;<br>\
(S, L, Msb, K;) gravity, staidness, steadiness, or<br>\
sedateness; (S, L, Msb;) and a quality inspiring<br>\
reverence or veneration: (Msb:) and, as some<br>\
say, mercy, pity, or compassion: [see also سَكَنٌ:]<br>\
and aid or assistance; or victory or conquest:<br>\
and a thing whereby a man is calmed, or tranquillized: (L:) pl. of the first word سَكَائِنُ.<br>\
(Har p. 62.) One says of a man who is calm or<br>\
tranquil, or grave &amp;c., عَلَيْهِ السَّكِينَةُ [Upon him is<br>\
resting, or abiding, calmness &amp;c.]. (L.) And it<br>\
is said in a trad., respecting the Prophet, on the<br>\
occasion of the coming down of revelation,<br>\
فَغَشِيَتْهُ السَّكِينَةُ, meaning And calmness, or tranquillity, and غَيْبَة [i. e., as here used, absence of<br>\
mind from self and others by its being exclusively<br>\
occupied by the contemplation of divine things],<br>\
came upon him. (L.) And in the Kur [ii. 249],<br>\
it is said, [with reference to the coming of the<br>\
ark of the covenant,] فِيهِ سَكِينَةٌ مِنْ رَبِّكُمْ, meaning<br>\
[In which shall be] a cause of your becoming<br>\
tranquil, [or easy in your minds,] when it cometh to<br>\
you [from your Lord]: (Zj, L, K:) or, as some say,<br>\
there was in it a head like that of the cat; when<br>\
it uttered a cry, victory betided the Children of<br>\
Israel: (L:) or a thing having a head like that<br>\
of the cat [and a tail like that of the cat (Bd)],<br>\
of chrysolite and sapphire, and a pair of wings:<br>\
(L, K:) or an image like the cat, that was with<br>\
them among their forces, on the appearance of<br>\
which their enemies were routed: or an animal<br>\
having a face like that of a human being, compact [in substance], the rest thereof being unsubstantial like the wind and the air: or the images<br>\
of the Prophets, from Adam to Mohammad:<br>\
(Bd:) or the signs, or miracles, with the performance of which Moses was endowed, and to<br>\
which they trusted so as to be easy, or quiet, in<br>\
their minds: (L:) or by the تَابُوت to which these<br>\
words refer is meant the heart, [or rather the<br>\
chest, i. e. bosom,] and the سكينة is the knowledge,<br>\
and purity, or sincerity, in the heart [or bosom].<br>\
(Bd.) In a trad. of&#39; Alee, respecting the building.<br>\
of the Kaabeh, it is said, فَأَرْسَلَ اللّٰه إِلَيْهِ السَّكِينَةَ,<br>\
meaning [And God sent to him] the wind swift<br>\
in its passage. (L.)<br>\
سُكَيْنَةٌ fem. of سُكَيْنٌ [q. v.]. (L, K. *)<br>\
الطُّرَّةُ السُّكَيْنِيَّةُ [The hair over the forehead (of a<br>\
girl or woman) that is cut with a straight, or<br>\
even, edge, or with two such edges one above the<br>\
other, so as to form a kind of border, after the<br>\
fashion of Sukeyneh,] is so called in relation to<br>\
Sukeyneh the daughter of El-Hoseyn. (S, L, K.)<br>\
سَكَّانٌ A maker of سَكَاكِين [or knives], (ISd,<br>\
L, K, *) pl. of سِكِينٌ; (ISd, L;) as also ↓ سَكَاكِينِىٌّ,<br>\
(ISd, L, K,) which latter is held by ISd to be<br>\
post-classical, being formed from the pl., whereas<br>\
by rule it should be formed from the sing. (L.)<br>\
سُكَّانٌ The ذَنَب, (Lth, S, MA, Mgh, L,) [i. e.]<br>\
the rudder, (MA, KL, PS,) of a ship or boat,<br>\

خَيْزُرَانٌ and كَوْثَلٌ [meaning the same, or its<br>\

to it the elevated neck of a she-camel, as being<br>\
long, and quick in motion, (EM p. 73,) [and<br>\
thus app. applying it to the upper and narrow<br>\

سِكِّينٌ a word of well-known meaning; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) i. e. A knife; (MA, PS;) i. q. مُدْيَةٌ;<br>\
(L;) as also ↓ سِكِّينَةٌ, (ISd, L, K,) a dial. var.,<br>\
(ISd, L,) occurring in a trad., but the former is<br>\
that which is commonly known: (L:) so called<br>\
because it stills the animals slaughtered with it:<br>\
(Az, L, Msb:) of the measure فِعِّيلٌ: (IDrd, L,<br>\
Msb:) or, accord. to some, its ن is augmentative,<br>\
so that it is of the measure فِعْلِينٌ: (Msb:) it is<br>\
masc., and sometimes fem.: (Zj, IAmb, * L, Msb,<br>\
K: *) not heard as fem. by IAar: (L:) held to<br>\
be only masc. by AZ and As and some others:<br>\
(Msb:) but sometimes it occurs in poetry as fem.<br>\
on the ground of meaning [as being syn. with<br>\
مُدْيَةٌ or شَفْرَهٌ], (Msb,) and as such it occurs in a<br>\
trad.: (L:) the pl. is سَكَاكِينُ. (ISd, MA, L.)<br>\

سَكَاكِينِىٌّ: see سَكَّانٌ.<br>\
سَاكِنٌ Still, motionless, stationary, in a state<br>\
of rest, quiet, calm, or unruffled: [applied to a<br>\
letter, quiescent; i. e. without a vowel immediately<br>\
following it:] still, calm, tranquil, becoming<br>\

[dying away, passing away, or ceasing to be:<br>\
remitting, or subsiding; becoming alleviated, light,<br>\
slight, or gentle:] still, or silent. (L. [See its<br>\
verb, سَكَنَ, first sentence.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Inhabiting, dwel-ling, or abiding; an inhabitant, or a lodger: (L,<br>\
Msb:) and ↓ سَكَنٌ signifies the same as سَاكِنٌ<br>\
[app. thus used]: (L:) the pl. of سَاكِنٌ is سُكَّانٌ.<br>\
(L, Msb.) You say, هُمْ سُكَّانُ فُلَانٍ [They are<br>\
the lodgers of such a one]. (S, L.) And سُكَّانُ<br>\
الدَّارِ signifies The Jinn, or Genii, inhabiting the<br>\
house. (L. [Respecting the custom of sacrificing<br>\
an animal to the Jinn on the occasion of buying<br>\
a house, in order to prevent any injury from the<br>\
Jinn thereof, see ذِبْجٌ. The belief that houses are<br>\
inhabited by Jinn obtains among the Arabs in the<br>\
present day.]) See also سَكْنٌ. ―<br>\

أَسْكَنُ More, and most, still, &amp;c.]<br>\
مَسْكَنٌ and مَسْكِنٌ; (S, L, Msb, K;) the people<br>\
of El-Hijáz say the former, (S, L,) and the latter<br>\
is anomalous; (L;) [A place of habitation;] a<br>\
place of alighting, abiding, sojourning, or lodging;<br>\
an abode, or a dwelling; (S, L, K;) a house, or a<br>\
tent; (S, L, Msb;) pl. مَسَاكِنُ: (Msb:) and<br>\
↓ سَكَنُ signifies the same as مَسْكِنٌ, [thus in the<br>\
Kur xvi. 82,] (Lh, L, and Ham p. 400,) as also<br>\
↓ سُكْنَى, (Lh, L,) and ↓ سُكْنٌ: you say, دَارٌ فِيهَا<br>\
↓ سَكَنٌ and ↓ سُكْنٌ, i. e. ↓ سُكْنَى [or مَسْكَنٌ, meaning A house in which is a place of habitation, or<br>\
a lodging]: (L: [↓ سَكَنٌ and ↓ سُكْنٌ are there<br>\
mentioned as syn., each of them, with مَسْكَنٌ and<br>\
سُكْنَى, but in different places; and I incline to<br>\
think that سُكْنٌ thus mentioned may be a mistranscription for سَكَنٌ: I have not found it elsewhere in this sense:]) and ↓ دَارِى لَكَ سُكْنَى, in<br>\
which the last word is [said to be] virtually in<br>\
the accus. case, as a denotative of state, meaning<br>\
[My house is for thee,] as made [or given] to be<br>\
inhabited, or as being inhabited: (Mgh:) or<br>\
↓ لَكَ دَارِى هٰذِهِ سُكْنَى, meaning To thee this my<br>\
house is a lent dwelling-place: and المَرْأَةِ ↓ سُكْنَى<br>\
means The wife&#39;s dwelling-place in which the<br>\
husband lodges her. (L.)<br>\
مَرْعًى مُسْكِنٌ Abundant pasturage, [that causes<br>\
people to abide in it,] not requiring to go away;<br>\
like مُرْبِعٌ and مُنْرِلٌ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَصْبَحُوا مُسْكِنِينَ<br>\
They became in the state termed مَسْكَنَةٌ. (L, K.)<br>\
مَسْكَنَةٌ (L, Msb, K) The state of him who is<br>\
termed مِسْكِينٌ: primarily, lowliness, humility, or<br>\
submissiveness: and meaning also lowness, abjectness, ignominiousness, abasement, or humiliation;<br>\
and paucity of property; and an evil state or<br>\
condition; also poverty of mind; and weakness;<br>\
(IAth, L:) it is from السُّكُونُ [an inf. n. of سَكَنَ<br>\
meaning as expl. in the first sentence of this<br>\
art.]. (L.)<br>\
مُسْكَانٌ, meaning “ an earnest,” or “ earnest<br>\
money,” and of which [as well as of مِسْكِينٌ] the<br>\
pl. is مَسَاكِينُ, belongs to art. مسك. (TA.)<br>\
مِسْكِينٌ (S, Mgh, L, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and مَسْكِينٌ,<br>\
(L, Msb, K,) the latter anomalous, for there is no<br>\
[other] instance of the measure مَفْعِيلٌ, (L,) of<br>\
the dial. of Benoo-Asad, (L, Msb,) mentioned by<br>\
Ks as heard by him from some one or more of<br>\
that tribe, (L,) others saying مِسْكِينٌ, (Msb,) of<br>\
the measure مِفْعِيلٌ (L) from السُّكُونُ, because the<br>\
person to whom it is applied trusts to, or relies<br>\
upon, others, so as to be, or become, easy, or<br>\
quiet, in mind: (Mgh, L, Msb:) primarily, (L,)<br>\
it signifies Lowly, humble, or submissive; (IAth,<br>\
Mgh, L;) and therefore the Prophet said, اَللّٰهُمَّ<br>\
أَحْيِنِى مِسْكِينًا وَأَمِتْنِى مِسْكِينًا وَاْحْشُرْنِى فِى زُمْرَةِ<br>\
المَسَاكِينِ [O God, make me to live lowly, and<br>\
make me to die lowly, and gather me among the<br>\
congregation of the lowly]: (Mgh, * L:) and<br>\
hence it sometimes applies to him who possesses<br>\
little and [sometimes] to him who possesses much:<br>\
(L:) sometimes, (S,) it signifies (S, IAth, L,<br>\
Msb, K) also (IAth, L) low, abject, ignominious,<br>\
or in a state of abasement or humiliation; (S,<br>\
IAth, L, Msb, K;) and weak; (S, L, K;) and<br>\
subdued, or oppressed; though possessing riches<br>\
or competence: (Msb:) [therefore] Sb says, it is<br>\
one of the words expressive of pity, or compassion; [and as such may be rendered poor;]<br>\
you say, مَرَرْت بِهِ المِسْكِينَ [I passed by him, I<br>\
mean the poor man], putting it in the accus. case<br>\
by the implication of أَعْنِى, though it may be in<br>\
the genitive case as a substitute [for the pronoun], and in the nom. case by the suppression<br>\
of هُوَ meant to be understood: (L:) in other<br>\
cases, (S,) it is syn. with فَقِيرٌ, (S, L, Msb,)<br>\
meaning (Msb) destitute, i. e. possessing nothing:<br>\
(L, Msb, K:) or accord. to ISk, مسكين means<br>\
thus; but the فقير is he who possesses a sufficiency of the means of subsistence: (Msb:) or<br>\
the former means possessing somewhat; (L;) or<br>\
[rather] needy, i. e. possessing what is not sufficient (L, K) for him (K) or for his family:<br>\
(L:) or caused by poverty to have little power of<br>\
motion; (L, K;) thus expl. by Aboo-Is-hák;<br>\
but this is improbable; for مسكين has the meaning of an active part. n., and his explanation<br>\
[like one of the others mentioned above] makes it to<br>\
have that of a pass. part. n.: (L:) Yoo says the<br>\
like of ISk: (Msb:) he used to say that the<br>\
مسكين is in a harder condition than the فقير: (S,<br>\
L, * Msb: *) he says, I asked an Arab of the<br>\
desert, Art thou فقير? and he answered, No, by<br>\
God, but rather مسكين; (S, L, * Msb;) but<br>\
&#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh says that this man may have<br>\
meant that he was low, or abject, by reason of his<br>\
distance from his people and his home; and that<br>\
he does not think he meant anything but that:<br>\
(L:) [J also adds,] it is said in a trad. that the<br>\
مسكين is not he whom a mouthful or two mouthfuls will turn back, or away, but is only he who<br>\
does not beg, and who is not known so that he<br>\
may be given [anything]; (S;) but Ziyádet-Allah<br>\
Ibn-Ahmad says that the فقير is he who sits in<br>\
his house, not begging, and the مسكين is he who<br>\
begs and is given; and hence it is argued that<br>\
the latter is in a better condition than the former;<br>\
though it indicates that the former is more highminded than the latter: (L:) accord. to As, the<br>\
مسكين is better in condition than the فقير; and<br>\
this is [said to be] the right assertion, (Mgh, L,<br>\
Msb,) for the pl. of the former is applied in the<br>\
Kur xviii. 78 to men possessing a ship, or boat,<br>\
which is worth a considerable sum; (L, Msb;)<br>\
but they may have been thus termed because<br>\
they were humbled and abased by the tyranny<br>\
of the king who took every ship, or boat, that he<br>\
found upon the sea, by force; (L;) and it is said<br>\
that these men were hirers, not owners, of the<br>\
vessel: (TA voce فَقِيرٌ, q. v.:) &#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh<br>\
says, that the مسكين is better in condition than<br>\
the فقير is shown by a passage in the Kur<br>\
[ix. 60], where it is said that the poor-rates are<br>\
for the فُقَرَآء and the مَسَاكِين; for you will find<br>\
the classes to be there mentioned in such an order<br>\
that the second is better in condition than the<br>\
first, and the third than the second, and in like<br>\
manner the fourth and the fifth and the sixth and<br>\
the seventh and the eighth: and he says that the<br>\
same is shown by the fact that the Arabs sometimes used مسكين as a proper name, but not<br>\
فقير: (L:) or when these two words are used<br>\
together, they differ in signification; and when<br>\
used separately, they [sometimes] signify the<br>\
same: (El-Bedr El-Karáfee, TA in art. فقر:)<br>\
[see more voce فَقِيرٌ:] a woman is termed مِسْكِينَةٌ<br>\
(Sb, S, L, Msb, K) and مِسْكِينٌ also; (S, L, K;)<br>\
the former by way of assimilation to فَقِيرَةٌ; (Sb,<br>\
S, L;) the latter being accord. to rule, for an<br>\
epithet of the measure مِفْعِيلٌ is regularly applied<br>\
alike to a male and a female; (S, Msb;) or, as<br>\
Abu-l-Hasan says, this is only when it is an<br>\
intensive epithet, which مِسْكِينَةٌ is not: (L:) the<br>\
pl. is مَسَاكِينُ and مِسْكِينُونَ, (S, L, K,) applied<br>\
to men, (K,) or to a company of people, (S, L,)<br>\
and مِسْكِينَاتٌ applied to female. (S, L, K.)<br>\
