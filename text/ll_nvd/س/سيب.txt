Msb;) (tropical:)  The serpent ran: (S, A, * Msb:) or went<br>\

along, quickly: (K, TA:) [or] so the former<br>\

فِى بَطْنِهِ حَيَّةٌ ↓ اِنْسَابَتْ (tropical:)  A serpent entered and<br>\
ran into his belly with the running of the water:<br>\
wherefore it was forbidden to drink from the<br>\
mouth of a skin. (TA.) El-Hareeree, in [his<br>\
first Makámeh, entitled] the San&#39;áneeyeh, [p. 20,]<br>\
uses the phrase, فِيهَا عَلَى غَرَارَةٍ ↓ انساب, meaning<br>\
He entered into it as the serpent enters into its lurking place. (TA.) And you say of a viper, ساب and<br>\

الكَلِمِ, meaning (tropical:)  [Verily art, or skill, in speech is<br>\
more eloquent, or effective,] than what is loose, or<br>\
unrestrained, [or rambling,] in words; i. e.<br>\

-b4-  See also<br>\
what next follows.<br>\
4<br>\
اساب, said of a horse, [and جُرْدَانَهُ ↓ سيّب<br>\
has the same or a similar meaning,] i. q. رَفَّضَ,<br>\
q. v. (TA in art. رفض.)<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْسَيَبَ see 1, in seven places.<br>\
سَيْبٌ [is an inf. n. of 1, used in the sense of<br>\
سَائِبٌ (q. v.), as will be shown in what follows in<br>\
this paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] (tropical:)  A gift: (S, M,<br>\
A, Mgh, Msb, K:) and a voluntary gift, by way<br>\
of alms, or as a good work: (TA:) and a benefaction, an act of beneficence or kindness, a favour,<br>\

(tropical:)  [i. e. Metal, or mineral; or pieces of gold or silver,<br>\
that are extracted from the earth; or any metals or<br>\
other minerals; or buried treasure of the people of<br>\
the Time of Ignorance]: (A, Msb:) or so سُيُوبٌ;<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S, M, Mgh, K;) which is the pl.: (A,<br>\
Msb:) the latter signifies, accord. to Th, metals,<br>\
or minerals: (M, TA:) accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed,<br>\
veins of gold and of silver, that come into existence, and appear, in the mines: so called<br>\
because of their running (لِانْسِيَابِهَا) in the earth:<br>\
accord to Z, treasure buried in the Time of Ignorance: or metal, or mineral: (TA:) because of<br>\
the gift of God, (M, Z, Mgh, TA,) to him who<br>\
finds it. (Z, TA.) The Prophet said, (Mgh, TA,)<br>\
فِى السُّيُوبِ الخُمْسُ, i. e. In the case of رِكَاز, the<br>\
fifth part [is for the government-treasury]. (A,<br>\
Mgh, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The hair of the tail of a<br>\
horse. (M, K.)<br>\
-A3-  And A pole with which a ship<br>\
or boat is propelled. (M, K.)<br>\
سِيبٌ A place, or channel, in which water runs:<br>\
(S, M, K:) or so سِيبُ مَآءٍ: (A:) pl. سُيُوبٌ. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  And The apple: in this sense a Pers. word<br>\
[arabicized]: and hence the name of [the celebrated grammarian] سِيبَوَيْهِ; as though meaning<br>\
“ the scent of apples; ” (M, K, * TA;) accord. to<br>\
Abu-l-&#39;Alà, (M, TA,) and Seer: (TA:) by some,<br>\
[app. such as mispronounce it,] this name is said<br>\
to be from the Pers. سِىْ signifying “ thirty ” and<br>\
بُويَهْ signifying “ odour; ” as though meaning<br>\
“ thirty odours: ” (MF, TA:) and some say that<br>\
وَيْهِ is an ejaculation; and that the relaters of<br>\
traditions dislike pronouncing this name therewith,<br>\
as also other similar names, and therefore say<br>\
سِيبُويَهْ, changing the ه into ة, but pausing upon<br>\
it [so as to pronounce it ه]. (TA.)<br>\
سَيَابٌ and ↓ سُيَّابٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ سَيَّابٌ (K)<br>\
[Unripe dates in the state in which they are<br>\
called] بَلَح: (S, M, K:) or [in the state in which<br>\
they are called] بُسْر: (K:) or green بُسْر: (AHn,<br>\
M:) As says that the flowers of the palm-tree<br>\
when they have become بَلَح are termed سَيَابٌ,<br>\
without teshdeed: (TA:) [but see بُسْرٌ:] the n. un.<br>\
is سَيَابَةٌ (S, M) and سُيَّابَةٌ (S) [and سَيَّابَةٌ]: Sh says<br>\
that they are called سَدَآء in the dial. of ElMedeeneh, and one is called سيابة in the dial. of<br>\
Wádi-l-Kurà: and he adds, I have heard the<br>\
Bahránees say ↓ سُيَّاب and سُيَّابَة. (TA.)<br>\
سَيَابَةٌ n. un. of سَيَابٌ; (S, M;) like as سُيَّابَةٌ is of<br>\
سُيَّابٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Wine. (K.)<br>\
سُيَّابٌ and سَيَّابٌ: see سَيَابٌ, in three places.<br>\
سَائِبٌ Running water. (Msb.) [See also سَيْبٌ,<br>\
first sentence.]<br>\
سَائِبَةٌ (tropical:)  Any beast that is left to pasture where<br>\
it will, without a pastor: (M, A, K: *) pl. سَوَائِبُ<br>\
and سُيَّبٌ. (A.) (assumed tropical:)  A camel that has lived until<br>\
his offspring have had offspring, and is therefore<br>\
set at liberty, and not ridden, (M, K,) nor laden<br>\
with a burden. (M.) In the Kur v. 102, (TA,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A she-camel that was set at liberty to pasture<br>\
where it would, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) in the Time<br>\
of Ignorance, (S, K,) on account of a vow (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K) and the like: (S, K:) or the<br>\
mother of a بَحِيرَة; (S, Mgh; [in the Msb, said<br>\
to be a بَحِيرَة (itself); and in one place in the TA<br>\
said to be a she-camel of which the dam is a<br>\
بَحِيرة; but both of these explanations require consideration, as will be seen from what follows;])<br>\
or (K) a she-camel which, having brought forth<br>\
females at ten successive births, was set at liberty<br>\
to pasture where she would, (S, K,) and not ridden,<br>\
nor was here milk drunk except by her young one<br>\
or a guest, until she died, when the men and the<br>\
women ate her together; and the ear of her last<br>\
female young one was slit, and she was [therefore]<br>\
called بَحِيرَة, and was a سَائِبَة like her mother:<br>\
(S:) or a she-camel of which a man, (M, IAth,<br>\
K,) in the Time of Ignorance, (M,) when he<br>\
came from a far journey, (M. IAth, K,) or re-<br>\
covered from a disease, (IAth, TA,) or had been<br>\
saved by his beast from difficulty or trouble, (M,<br>\
IAth,) or when his beast had been saved therefrom,<br>\
(K,) or from war, said, هِىَ سَائِبَةٌ; (M, IAth,<br>\
K;) i. e. she was left to pasture where she would,<br>\
without a pastor, and no use was made of her<br>\
back, nor was she debarred from water, nor from<br>\
herbage, nor ridden: (IAth, TA:) thus it signifies in the Kur: (M:) or a she-camel from<br>\
whose back a vertebra or [some other] bone was<br>\
taken forth, (M, K,) so that she became known<br>\
thereby, (M,) and which was not debarred from<br>\
water nor from herbage, nor ridden, (M, K,) nor<br>\
milked: (TA:) the pl. is سُيَّبٌ, like نُوَّحٌ pl. of<br>\
نَائِحَةٌ, and نُوَّمٌ pl. of نَائِمَةٌ; (S;) and سَوَائِبُ.<br>\
(TA.) It is said in a trad., “I saw &#39;Amr Ibn-Loheí dragging his intestines in the fire [of<br>\
Hell]: ” and he was the first who set at liberty<br>\
سَوَائِب: the doing of which is forbidden in the<br>\
Kur v. 102. (TA.) And it is related that a<br>\
hostile attack was made upon a certain man of the<br>\
Arabs, and he found not any [other] beast to<br>\
ride, so he rode a سَائِبَة: whereupon it was said<br>\
to him, “Dost thou ride what is forbidden? ” and<br>\
he replied, يَرْكَبُ الحَرَامَ مَنْ لَا حَلَالَ لَهُ [He<br>\
rides what is forbidden who has not what is<br>\
allowed]: and this saying became a proverb.<br>\
(M.) السَّائِبَتَانِ means The بَدَنَتَانِ [i. e. two<br>\
camels, or cows or bulls, for sacrifice,] which the<br>\
Prophet brought as offerings to the House [of<br>\
God at Mekkeh], and which one of the believers<br>\
in a plurality of gods took away: they are thus<br>\
called because he gave them up (سَيَّبَهُمَا) to God.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A slave emancipated so that the<br>\
emancipator has no claim to inherit from him,<br>\
(S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) except, accord. to EshSháfi&#39;ee, in the case of the slave&#39;s dying without<br>\
appointing any heir, in which case his inheritance<br>\
belongs to his emancipator, (TA,) [for] such an<br>\
emancipated slave may bestow his property where<br>\
[or on whom] he pleases, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,)<br>\
agreeably with a trad.: (Mgh, TA:) [in the S,<br>\
and in the Msb as on the authority of IF, it is<br>\
added, that “ this is what is related to have been<br>\
forbidden: ” but from what has been stated above,<br>\
this appears to be a mistake; and I think that<br>\
these words have been misplaced in the S and<br>\
Msb, and that they relate only to the she-camel<br>\
termed سَائِبَة:] a slave is thus emancipated by his<br>\
owner&#39;s saying to him, أَنْتَ سَائِبَةٌ. (S.) &#39;Omar<br>\
said, السَّائِبَةُ وَالصَّدَقَةُ لِيَوْمِهِمَا [The sáïbeh and alms<br>\
are for their day]: i. e., for the day of resurrection; so that one may not return to the deriving<br>\
of any advantage from them in the present world.<br>\
