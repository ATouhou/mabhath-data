سَتَهَهُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
سَتَهَ, (K,) inf. n. سَتْهٌ, (S,)<br>\
He struck his اِسْت; (S, K;) i. e. a man&#39;s. (S.<br>\
[See اِسْت below.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, (K,) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(TA,) He followed him from behind, (K, TA,)<br>\
not quitting him; because following his اِسْت.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أُسْتِهَ He (a man) was, or became, large in<br>\
the buttocks. (TA.)<br>\
سَتْهٌ and سُتْهٌ: see اِسْتٌ, below.<br>\
سِتْهٌ: see اِسْتٌ, below, in two places.<br>\
سَتَهٌ: see اِسْتٌ, below, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
Largeness of the اِسْت. (S, K.)<br>\
سَتِهٌ; and its fem., with ة: see أَسْتَهُ, in two<br>\
places: and see what next follows.<br>\
سَتَهِىٌّ Of, or relating to, the اِسْت; and in the<br>\
same sense, if you will, you may say ↓ اِسْتِىٌّ;<br>\
and ↓ سَتِهٌ also, with kesr to the ت, like as they<br>\
said حَرِحٌ. (S.)<br>\
سُتْهُمٌ: see أَسْتَهُ, in three places.<br>\
سُتَيْهَةٌ dim. of اِسْتٌ, from the original of the<br>\
latter, i. e. سَتَهٌ. (TA.)<br>\
سُتَاهِىٌّ: see أَسْتَهُ, in two places.<br>\
سُتَيْهِىٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
سَيْتَهِىٌّ, thus correctly, in the handwriting of<br>\
Sgh, on the authority of Fr; in the K, ↓ سُتَيْهِىٌّ;<br>\
(TA;) One who always walks, or goes, at the<br>\
rear of a people, or party, (IB, K, TA,) remaining behind them, and looking to their goods.<br>\
(IB, TA.)<br>\
اِسْتٌ (S, Mgh, K, written with the conjunctive<br>\
hemzeh, Msb in art. است) and ↓ سَتَهٌ (S Mgh, K)<br>\
and ↓ سَتْهٌ (K) and ↓ سِتْهٌ (CK [but not in my MS.<br>\
copy of the K nor in the TA, and of doubtful authority, as will be seen from what follows,]) signify the<br>\
same, (S, * Mgh, * K,) i. e. The podex, buttock or buttocks, posteriors, rump, or croup; and sometimes<br>\
the anus; (S;) ↓ سَتَهٌ being the original form, as<br>\
is shown by the pl., (S, Mgh,) which is أَسْتَاهٌ;<br>\
(S, Mgh, K;) like جَمَلٌ and أَجْمَالٌ: it may not<br>\
be [↓ سِتْهٌ and ↓ سُتْهٌ] like جِذْعٌ and قُفْلٌ, of which<br>\
the pls. are also of the measure أَفْعَالٌ, because,<br>\
when you restore the ء which is the final radical,<br>\
and reject the medial radical [which is ت], you<br>\
say سَهٌ, with fet-h, (S, Mgh, *) which has both of<br>\
the meanings expl. above, as also سُهٌ, (K,) but<br>\
[SM says,] this last, mentioned by the author of<br>\
the K, is strange, and I have not seen it on the<br>\
authority of any one [else]: (TA:) and some say<br>\
سَتٌ, (IKh, S, Mgh, TA,) suppressing the final<br>\
radical [of سَتَهٌ], (S,) i. e., without ه at the end<br>\
and without hemzeh [or ا] at the beginning.<br>\
(TA.) [All are of the fem. gender.] It is said in<br>\
a trad., العَيْنُ وِكَآءُ السَّهِ, or, as some relate it,<br>\
السَّتِ, (S, Mgh, TA,) [The eye is the tie of the<br>\
anus,] meaning that when one [closes the eye<br>\
and] sleeps, the tie of the سَه becomes loosed, and<br>\
the excrement and wind issue. (TA.) And أَبُو<br>\
الأَسْتَاهِ means He who has large posteriors. (Az,<br>\
TA.) بِاسْتِ فُلَانٍ is a phrase of the Arabs significant of reviling; (S;) said when holding one in<br>\
contempt; meaning لَصِقَ العَارُ بِاسْتِ فُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  [May<br>\
disgrace cleave to the است of such a one]. (Mgh.)<br>\
And يَا ابْنَ اسْتِهَا (tropical:)  [O son of her است], (K, TA,)<br>\
a prov. of the Arabs, (TA,) is an allusion to one&#39;s<br>\
father&#39;s إِحْمَاض [see 2 in art. حمض] of the<br>\
former&#39;s mother; (Z, TA;) and is said to mean<br>\
أَنَّهُ وُلِدَ مِنِ اسْتِهَا: (TA:) and the Arabs called<br>\
the sons of the female slave بَنُو اسْتِهَا. (Sh, TA.)<br>\
And one says to a man who is deemed abject and<br>\
weak, اِسْتُ أُمِّكَ أَضْيَقُ [lit. Thy mother&#39;s است is<br>\
too contracted], and اِسْتُكَ أَضْيَقُ مِنْ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا<br>\
وَ كَذَا [Thine است is too contracted, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  thine ability is too small, for thy doing such<br>\
and such things]: (TA: [see also Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov., i. 607:]) and أَنْتُمْ أَضْيَقُ أَسْتَاهًا مِنْ أَنْ تَفْعَلُوهُ<br>\
[in like manner] is an allusion to inability [meaning (assumed tropical:)  Ye are unable to do it]. (K.) The saying<br>\
of a poet,<br>\
وَ أَنْتَ مَكَانُكَ مِنْ وَائِلٍ<br>\
مَكَانُ القُرَادِ مِنِ اسْتِ الجَمَلْ<br>\
(tropical:)  [And thou, thy place in the tribe of Wáïl is<br>\
like the place of the tick in the rump of the<br>\
camel,] is tropical; for they do not [properly]<br>\
say اِسْتُ الجَمَلِ, but عَجُزُ الجَمَلِ. (S.) One<br>\
says also to a man who is deemed low, or base,<br>\
أَنْتَ الاِسْتُ السُّفْلَى, (TA,) and انت السبَّهُ السُّفْلَى,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Thou art among others in the condition of the است of mankind: (S, TA:) and of<br>\
low, or base, men, one says, هٰؤُلَآءِ الأَسْتَاهُ; and of<br>\
such as are excellent, هٰؤُلَآءِ الأَعْيَانُ, and الوُجُوهُ.<br>\
(TA.) And one says, لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ اسْتَ الكَلْبَةِ, (A,<br>\
K,) a prov., (TA,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  I experienced<br>\
from him, or it, what I disliked, or hated. (A,<br>\
K, TA. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov., ii. 445.])<br>\
And اِسْتُ البَائِنِ أَعْرَفُ, or أَعْلَمُ: see art. بين.<br>\
And مَا لَكَ اسْتٌ مَعِ اسْتِكَ (assumed tropical:)  Thou hast no one<br>\
[with thee] to assist thee: (A, K, TA:) another<br>\
prov., related on the authority of AZ as said to<br>\
one who has no large amount of property, nor<br>\
number of men. (Sgh, TA.) And تَرَكْتُهُ بِاسْتِ<br>\
الأَرْضِ, another prov., (TA,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  I left<br>\
him destitute, poor, (K, TA,) possessing nothing:<br>\
(TA:) or تَرَكْتُهُ بِاسْتِ المَتْنِ (assumed tropical:)  I left him on the<br>\
hard ground, alone. (Meyd.) And مَا لَكَ فِى هٰذَا<br>\
الأَمْرِ اسْتٌ وَ لَا فَمٌ (assumed tropical:)  Thou hast not in this thing,<br>\
or affair, root nor branch: Jereer says,<br>\
فَمَا لَكُمُ اسْتٌ فِى العَلَآءِ وَ لَآ فَمُ<br>\
[And ye have not any root in eminence, nor<br>\
branch]. (TA.) And كَانَ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى اسْتِ الدَّهْرِ<br>\
(tropical:)  That was in the beginning of time: (A, K, TA:)<br>\
or in the olden time; (AO, S, TA;) as also<br>\
عَلَى إِسِّ الدَّهْرِ. (AO, TA.) See also art. است.<br>\
[And see other exs. in Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 355<br>\
and 378 (a variation of a prov. mentioned in the<br>\
preceding page) and 607 and 622 and 729-730.]<br>\
أَسْتَهُ, applied to a man, (ISk, S, Mgh,) Large<br>\
in the اِسْت, (ISk, S, Mgh, K,) or عَجُز; (S;) as<br>\

and so, applied to a woman, سَتْهَآءُ [fem. of the<br>\
first], and ↓ سُتْهُمٌ, in which the م is augmentative, (ISk, S,) and ↓ سَتِهَةٌ: (TA:) pl. [of the<br>\
