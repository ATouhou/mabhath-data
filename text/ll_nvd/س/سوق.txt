سَاقَ المَاشِيَةَ, (S, K,) or النَّعَمَ, (Mgh,) or<br>\
الدَّابَّةَ, (Msb,) aor. يَسُوقُ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
سَوْقٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and سِيَاقٌ, (S, [so in both<br>\
of my copies, but it is said in the JK that this<br>\
latter is used in relation to death, and such is<br>\
generally the case,]) or سَيَاقٌ, like سَحَابٌ, (TA,<br>\
[but this I have not found elsewhere, and I doubt<br>\
its correctness,]) and سِيَاقَةٌ and مَسَاقٌ, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
He drove the cattle [or the beast]; he urged the<br>\
cattle [or the beast] to go; (Mgh;) and ↓ استاقها<br>\
signifies the same, (S, K,) as also ↓ اساقها, and<br>\
↓ سوّقها; (TA;) or تَسْوِيقٌ, the inf. n. [or this last],<br>\
signifies the driving well: (KL:) [and accord.<br>\
to Freytag, ↓ استساق, followed by an accus., signifies the same as سَاقَ as expl. above; but for<br>\
this he names no authority.] Hence, in the Kur<br>\
[lxxv. 30], إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ المَسَاقُ (TA) i. e. To<br>\
thy Lord, and his judgment, on that day, shall be<br>\
the driving. (Bd, Jel.) And the saying, in a<br>\
trad., لَاتَقُومُ السَّاعَةُ حَتَّى يَخْرُجَ رَجُلٌ مِنْ قَحْطَانَ<br>\
يَسُوقُ النَّاسَ بِعَصًاهُ [properly rendered The resurrection, or the hour thereof, shall not come to pass<br>\
until a man come forth from the tribe of Kahtán<br>\
driving the people with his staff], allusive to his<br>\
having the mastery over them, and their obeying<br>\
him; the staff being mentioned only to indicate<br>\
his tyrannical and rough treatment of them.<br>\
(TA.) [And hence the saying, ساق عَلَىَّ فُلَانًا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He urged such a one to intercede for him with<br>\
me.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence also,] سَاقَهُ القَدَرُ إِلَى مَا قُدِّرَ لَهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Destiny drove him, or impelled him, to that<br>\
which was destined for him]. (TA.) [And in like<br>\

المَرْأَةِ مَهْرَهَا, (K,) or صَدَاقَهَا, (S, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
سِيَاقٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اساقهُ; (Msb, K;) (tropical:)  He sent<br>\
to the woman her dowry; (K, TA;) or conveyed<br>\
it, or caused it to be conveyed, to her; (Msb;)<br>\
though consisting of dirhems or deenárs; because<br>\
the dowry, with the Arabs, originally consisted<br>\
of camels, which are driven. (TA.) And hence,<br>\
مَاسُقْتَ إِلَيْهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  What didst thou give her<br>\
as her dowry? occurring in a trad.; or, as some<br>\
related it, مَا سُقْتَ مِنْهَا, i. e. What didst thou give<br>\
for her, or in exchange for her? (TA.) And<br>\
ساق إِلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ (assumed tropical:)  [He made, or caused, the thing<br>\

―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence likewise,] سَاقَتِ الرِّيحُ السَّحَابَ (tropical:)  [The<br>\
wind drove along the clouds]. (S, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
[And ساق الحَدِيثَ, inf. n. سِيَاقٌ and سَوْقٌ and<br>\
مَسَاقٌ, (tropical:)  He carried on the narrative, or discourse.]<br>\
You say, فُلَانٌ يَسُوقُ الحَدِيثَ أَحْسَنَ سِيَاقٍ (tropical:)  [Such<br>\
a one carries on the narrative, or discourse, in<br>\
the best manner of doing so]. (Mgh, TA.) And<br>\

narrative, or discourse, is carried on]. (TA.)<br>\
And كَلَامٌ مَسَاقُهُ إِلَى كَذَا (tropical:)  [Speech whereof the<br>\
carrying-on is pointed to such a thing]. (TA.)<br>\
And جِئْتُكَ بِالحَدِيثِ عَلَى سَوْقِهِ (tropical:)  [I uttered to<br>\
thee the narrative, or discourse, after the proper<br>\
manner of the carrying-on thereof]. (TA.) [In<br>\
like manner also one says,] ساق الأُمُورَ أَحْسَنَ<br>\
مَسَاقٍ (assumed tropical:)  [He carried on, or prosecuted, affairs, or<br>\
the affairs, in the best manner of doing so]. (A<br>\
in art. حوذ.) ―<br>\
-b6-  سَوْقُ المَعْلُومِ مَسَاقَ غَيْرِهِ [from<br>\
ساق الحَدِيثَ expl. above] means (assumed tropical:)  The asking<br>\
respecting that which one knows in the manner<br>\
of one&#39;s asking respecting that which he knows<br>\
not: a mode of speech implying hyperbole: as<br>\
when one says, أَوَجْهُكَ هٰذَا أَمْ بَدْرٌ [Is this thy<br>\
face or a full moon?]. (Kull p. 211.) ―<br>\
-b7-  ساق<br>\
said of a sick man, (K,) and ساق نَفْسَهُ, [app. thus<br>\
originally,] (Ks, Msb, TA,) and ساق بِنَفْسِهِ, (TA,)<br>\
aor. يَسُوقُ, (Ks, S, O, Msb, TA,) inf. n. سِيَاقٌ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K,) originally سِوَاقٌ, (TA,) and سَوْقٌ<br>\
(O, K) and سُؤُوقٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  He cast forth, or<br>\

agony of death, or at the point of having his soul<br>\
drawn forth; (S, O, Msb, TA;) or he began to<br>\
give up his spirit, or to have his soul drawn forth.<br>\
(K.) You say, رَأَيْتُ فُلَانًا يَسُوقُ (tropical:)  I saw such a<br>\
one giving up his spirit at death. (S, O, TA.)<br>\
And رَأَيْتُ فُلَانًا بِالسَّوْقِ [or فِى السِّيَاقِ, as in the<br>\
Msb,] (tropical:)  I saw such a one in the act [or agony]<br>\
of death; and يُسَاقُ [having his soul expelled],<br>\
inf. n. سَوْقٌ: and إِنَّ نَفْسَهُ لَتُسَاقُ (tropical:)  [Verily his soul<br>\
is being expelled]. (ISh, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  سَاقَهُ, (K,)<br>\
first pers. سُقْتُهُ, (S,) aor. as above, inf. n. سَوْقٌ,<br>\
(TA,) also signifies He hit, or hurt, his (another<br>\
man&#39;s, S) سَاق [or shank]. (S, K.)<br>\

-b2-<br>\
سوّق فُلَانًا أَمْرَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He made such a one to have the<br>\
ruling, or ordering, of his affair, or case. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, K.) ―<br>\

(TA,) or of a tree, (K,) more properly of the<br>\
former, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  It had a سَاق [i. e. stem, stock,<br>\
or trunk]. (K, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
ساوقهُ He vied, or competed, with him, in<br>\
driving: (K: [in the CK, for فى السَّوْقِ, is put<br>\
فى السُّوْقِ:]) or he vied, or competed, with him to<br>\
decide which of them twain was the stronger;<br>\
from the phrase قَامَتِ الحَرْبُ عَلَى سَاقٍ. (S.)<br>\
[Hence,] one says بَعِيرٌ يُسَاوِقُ الصَّيْدَ (tropical:)  [A camel<br>\
that vies with the animals of the chase in driving<br>\
on, or in strength]. (JK, Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  مُسَاوَقَةٌ is also syn. with مُتَابَعَةٌ [app. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  The making to be consecutive, or successive,<br>\
for it is added], as though driving on one another,<br>\
or as though one portion were driving on another.<br>\
(TA. [See 6, its quasi-pass.].) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Freytag also<br>\
assigns to ساوق the meaning of He, or it, followed<br>\
(secutus fuit), as on the authority of the Hamáseh;<br>\
but without pointing out the page; and it is not<br>\
in his index of words explained therein.]<br>\
4<br>\
أَسْوَقَ see 1, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  أَسَقْتُهُ إِبِلًا I made<br>\
him to drive camels: (K:) or I gave to him<br>\
camels, to drive them: (S, TA:) or (tropical:)  I made him<br>\

5<br>\
تسوّق القَوْمُ The people, or party, [trafficked<br>\

TA:) the vulgar say ↓ سَوَّقُوا. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تساوقت الإِبِلُ (tropical:)  The camels followed one<br>\
another; (Az, O, Msb, K, TA;) and in like<br>\
manner one says تَقَاوَدَت; (O, K, * TA;) as<br>\
though, by reason of their weakness and leanness,<br>\
some of them held back from others. (TA.) And<br>\
تساوقت الغَنَمُ (tropical:)  The sheep, or goats, pressed, one<br>\
upon another, (K,) or followed one another, (O,)<br>\

-b2-  The lawyers say,<br>\
تساوقت الخِطْبَتَانِ, meaning (tropical:)  [The two demandings of a woman in marriage] were simultaneous:<br>\
but [Fei says] I have not found it in the books<br>\
of lexicology in this sense. (Msb.)<br>\
7<br>\
انساقت المَاشِيَةُ The cattle went, or went<br>\
along, being driven; [or as though driven; or<br>\

انساقت الإِبِلُ [has the like signification: or means]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The camels became consecutive. (TA. [See<br>\
also 6.])<br>\
8<br>\
إِسْتَوَقَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَسْوَقَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
سَاقٌ The shank; i. e. the part between the knee<br>\
and the foot of a human being; (Msb;) or the<br>\
part between the ankle and the knee (K, TA) of a<br>\
human being; (TA;) the ساق of the human foot:<br>\
(S, TA:) and [the part properly corresponding<br>\
thereto, i. e. the thigh commonly so called, and<br>\
also the arm, of a beast;] the part above the<br>\
وَظِيف of the horse and mule and ass and camel,<br>\
and the part above the كُرَاع of the ox-kind and<br>\
sheep or goat and antelope: (TA:) [it is also<br>\
sometimes applied to the shank commonly so<br>\
called, of the hind leg, and, less properly, of the<br>\
fore leg, of a beast: and to the bone of any of the<br>\
parts above mentioned: and sometimes, by synecdoche, to the hind leg, and, less properly, to the<br>\
fore leg also, of a beast: it generally corresponds<br>\
to ذِرَاعٌ: of a bird, it is the thigh commonly so<br>\
called: and sometimes the shank commonly so<br>\
called: and, by synecdoche, the leg:] it is of the<br>\
fem. gender: (Msb, TA:) and for this reason,<br>\
(TA,) the dim. is ↓ سُوَيْقَةٌ: (Msb, TA:) the pl. [of<br>\
mult.] is سُوقٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and سِيقَانٌ<br>\
and [of pauc.] أَسْؤُقٌ, (S, O, K,) the و in this last<br>\
being with ء in order that it may bear the dammeh.<br>\
(O, K.) A poet says,<br>\
لِلْفَتَى عَقْلٌ يَعِيشُ بِهِ<br>\
حَيْثُ تَهْدِى سَاقَهُ قَدَمُهْ<br>\
meaning The young man has intelligence whereby<br>\
he lives when his foot directs aright his shank.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) And one says of a man when difficulty, or calamity, befalls him, كَشَفَ عَنْ سَاقِهِ<br>\
[lit. He uncovered his shank; meaning (assumed tropical:)  he prepared himself for difficulty]: so says IAmb: and<br>\
hence, he says, (TA, [in which a similar explanation is cited from ISd also,]) they mention the<br>\
ساق when they mean to express the difficulty of<br>\
a case or an event, and to tell of the terror<br>\
occasioned thereby. (K, TA.) Thus, the saying<br>\
يَوْمَ يُكْشَفُ عَنْ سَاقٍ, (S, K, TA,) in the Kur<br>\
[lxviii. 42], (S, TA,) [lit. On a day when a shank<br>\
shall be uncovered,] means (assumed tropical:)  on a day when difficulty, or calamity, shall be disclosed. (I&#39;Ab,<br>\
Mujáhid, S, K, TA.) It is like the saying,<br>\
قَامَتِ الحَرْبُ عَلَى سَاقٍ, (S, TA,) which means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The war, or battle, became vehement, (Msb in<br>\
this art. and in art. حرب,) so that safety from<br>\
destruction was difficult of attainment: (Id. in<br>\
art. حرب:) and كَشَفَتِ الحَرْبُ عَنْ سَاقٍ, [as also<br>\
شَمَّرَتْ عَنْ سَاقِهَا,] i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The war, or battle,<br>\
became vehement. (Jel in lxviii. 42.) And in<br>\
like manner, وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ, (K, TA,) in the<br>\
Kur [lxxv. 29], (TA,) means (assumed tropical:)  And the affliction<br>\
of the present state of existence shall be combined<br>\
with that of the final state: (K, TA:) or it means<br>\
when the [one] leg shall be inwrapped with the<br>\
other leg by means of the grave-clothes. (TA.)<br>\
One says also, قَامَ القَوْمُ عَلَى سَاقٍ (assumed tropical:)  The people<br>\
or party, became in a state of toil, and trouble, or<br>\
distress. (TA.) And قَرَعَ لِلْأَمْرِ سَاقَهُ, [originating<br>\
from one&#39;s striking the shin of his camel in order<br>\
to make him lie down to be mounted; lit. He<br>\
struck his shank for the affair;] meaning (assumed tropical:)  he<br>\
prepared himself for the thing, or affair; syn.<br>\
تَشَمَّرَ: (JK:) or he was, or became, light, or<br>\
active, and he rose, or hastened, to do the thing;<br>\
or (assumed tropical:)  he applied himself vigorously, or diligently,<br>\
or with energy, to the thing, or affair; i. q.<br>\
شَمَّرَ لَهُ [q. v.]; (TA;) or تَجَرَّدَ لَهُ. (A and TA in<br>\
art. قرع [q. v.: see also ظُنْبُوبٌ, in several places].)<br>\
[It is also said that] أَوْهَتْ بِسَاقٍ means كِدْتُ<br>\
أَفْعَلُ [i. e. I nearly, or almost, did what I purposed: but this explanation seems to have been<br>\
derived only from what here, as in the TA,<br>\
immediately follows]: Kurt says, describing the<br>\
wolf,<br>\
وَلٰكِنِّى رَمَيْتُكَ مِنْ بَعِيدٍ<br>\
فَلَمْ أَفْعَلْ وَقَدْ أَوْهَتْ بِسَاقِ<br>\
[i. e., app., But I shot at thee from afar, and I<br>\
did not what I purposed, though it (the shot,<br>\
الرَّمْيَةُ, I suppose, being meant to be understood,)<br>\
maimed a shank: which virtually means, though<br>\
I nearly did what I purposed: the poet, I assume, says اوهت بساق for the sake of the measure<br>\
and rhyme, for أَوْهَتْ سَاقًا: see what is said, in<br>\
the explanations of the preposition بِ, respecting<br>\
the phrase وَامْسَحُوا بِرُؤُسِكُمْ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  By a<br>\
secondary application, سَاقٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  [A greave;<br>\
i. e.] a thing that is worn on the ساق [or shank]<br>\
of the leg, made of iron or other material. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  [The stem, stock, or trunk, i. e.] the<br>\
part between the أَصْل [here meaning root, or foot,<br>\
(though it is also syn. with ساق in the sense in<br>\
which the latter is here explained,)] and the<br>\
place where the branches shoot out; (TA;) or<br>\
the support; (Msb;) or the جِذْع; (S, K;) of a<br>\
tree, or shrub: (S, Msb, K, TA:) pl. [of mult.]<br>\
سُوقٌ (Msb, TA) and سُوقٌ and سُوُوقٌ and سُؤُوقٌ<br>\
and [of pauc.] أَسْوُقٌ and أَسْؤُقٌ. (TA.) It is<br>\
related in a trad. of Mo&#39;áwiyeh, that a man said,<br>\
I applied to him to decide in a litigation with the<br>\
son of my brother, and began to overcome him<br>\
therein; whereupon he said, Thou art like as<br>\
Aboo-Duwád says,<br>\
أَنَّى أُتِيحَ لَهُ حِرْبَآءُ تَنْضُبَةٍ<br>\
لَا يُرْسِلُ السَّاقَ إِلَّا مُمْسِكًا سَاقَا<br>\
[Whencesoever, or however, a preparation is made<br>\
for him, to catch him, he is like a chameleon<br>\
of a tree of the kind called تَنْضُب, he will not<br>\
loose the stem thereof unless grasping a stem]:<br>\
he meant that no plea of his came to nought but<br>\
he clung to another; likening him to the chameleon, which places itself facing the sun, and ascends<br>\
half-way up the tree, or shrub, then climbs to the<br>\
branches when the sun becomes hot, then climbs to a<br>\
higher branch, and will not loose the former until<br>\
it grasps the other. (O, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence, perhaps, as it seems to be indicated in the O,] one says,<br>\
وَلَدَتْ فُلَانَةُ ثَلَاثَةَ بَنِينَ عَلَى سَاقٍ, (K, [in the<br>\
copies of which, however, I find ثَلَاثَ put for<br>\
ثَلَاثَةَ,]) or عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدٍ, (S,) or وَاحِدَةٍ, (O,)<br>\
i. e. (tropical:)  Such a woman brought forth three sons, one<br>\
after another, without any girl between them:<br>\
(S, O, K, TA:) so says ISk: and وُلِدَ لِفُلَانٍ ثَلَاثَةُ<br>\
أَوْلَادٍ سَاقًا عَلَى سَاقٍ, i. e. (tropical:)  Three children were<br>\
born to such a one, one after another. (TA.) And<br>\
بَنَى القَوْمُ بُيُوتَهُمْ عَلَى سَاقٍ وَاحِدٍ (assumed tropical:)  [The people, or<br>\
party, built their houses, or constructed their<br>\
tents, in one row or series]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  سَاقٌ also<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  The soul, or self; syn. نَفْسٌ: hence the<br>\
saying of &#39;Alee (in the war of the [schismatics<br>\
called] شُرَاة), لَابُدَّ لِى مِنْ قِتَالِهِمْ وَلَوْ تَلِفَتْ سَاقِى<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [There is not for me any way of avoiding combating them, though my soul, or self, should perish<br>\
by my doing so]. (Abu-l-&#39; Abbás, O, TA.) So too<br>\
in the saying, قَدَحَ فِى سَاقِهِ [as though meaning<br>\
(tropical:) He cankered his very soul]: (IAar, TA in<br>\
art. قدح:) [or] he deceived him, and did that<br>\
which was displeasing to him: (L in that art.:)<br>\
or (tropical:)  he impugned his honour, or reputation; from<br>\
the action of canker-worms (قَوَادِح) cankering the<br>\
stem, or trunk, of a shrub, or tree. (A in that<br>\
art.)<br>\
-A2-  سَاقُ حُرٍّ [is said to signify] The male of<br>\
the قَمَارِىّ [or species of collared turtle-doves of<br>\
which the female is called قُمْرِيَّةٌ (see قُمْرِىٌّ)];<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) i. e. the وَرَشَان: (S, Msb:) the<br>\
former appellation being given to it as imitative<br>\
of its cry: (As, K:) it has neither fem. nor pl.:<br>\
(AHát, TA:) or السَّاقُ is the pigeon; and الحُرُّ,<br>\
its young one: (Sh, K:) the poet Ibn-Harmeh uses<br>\
the phrase كَسَاقِ ابْنِ حُرٍّ. (O, TA.) [See more<br>\
in art. حر.]<br>\
سَوْقٌ: see سِيَاقٌ.<br>\
سُوقٌ [A market, mart, or fair;] a place in<br>\
which commerce is carried on; (ISd, Msb, TA;)<br>\
a place of articles of merchandise: (Mgh, TA:)<br>\
so called because people drive their commodities<br>\
thither: (TA:) [in the S unexplained, and in the<br>\
K only said to be well-known:] of the fem. gender,<br>\
and masc., (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *) the former in the<br>\
dial. of the people of El-Hijáz, and the latter in<br>\
that of Temeem, (S and Msb voce زُقَاقٌ, q. v.,)<br>\
the former the more chaste, or the making it<br>\
masc. is a mistake: (Msb:) pl. أَسْوَاقٌ: (TA:)<br>\
the dim. is ↓ سُوَيْقَةٌ [with ة, confirming the opinion<br>\
of those who hold سُوقٌ to be only fem.]: also signifying merchandise, syn. تِجَارَةٌ; as in the phrase,<br>\
جَاءَتْ سُوَيْقَةٌ [Merchandise came]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] سُوقُ الحَرْبِ (tropical:)  The thickest, or most<br>\
vehement part (حَوْمَة) of the fight; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
and so الحَرْبِ ↓ سُوقَةُ; i. e. the midst thereof.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
سَوَقٌ Length of the shanks: (S, K:) or beauty<br>\
thereof: (K:) or it signifies also beauty of the<br>\
shank. (S.)<br>\
سَاقَةٌ (tropical:)  The rear, or hinder part, of an army:<br>\
(S, Mgh, K, TA:) pl. of ↓ سَائِقٌ; being those who<br>\
drive on the army from behind them, and who<br>\
guard them: (TA:) or as though pl. of سَائِقٌ, like<br>\
as قَادَةٌ is of قَائِدٌ. (Mgh.) And hence, سَاقَةُ<br>\
الحَاجِّ (tropical:)  [The rear of the company of pilgrims].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
سُوقَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  A subject, and the subjects, of a king;<br>\
(K, TA;) so called because driven by him;<br>\
(TA;) contr. of مَلِكٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb;) whether<br>\
practising traffic or not: (Mgh:) not meaning of<br>\
the people of the أَسْوَاق [or markets], as the vulgar<br>\
think; (Msb;) for such are called سُوقِيُّونَ, sing.<br>\
سُوقِىٌّ: (Ham p. 534:) it is used alike as sing.<br>\
and pl. (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and dual (Mgh, Msb)<br>\
and masc. and fem.: (S, K:) but sometimes it<br>\
has سُوَقٌ for its pl. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  سُوقَةُ الطُّرْثُوثِ [in<br>\
the CK, erroneously, التُّرْثُوثِ] The part of the<br>\
[plant called] طرثوث that is below the نِكْعَة [or<br>\
نَكَعَة or نُكَعَة, which is the head from the top to<br>\
the extent of a finger, or the flower at the head<br>\
thereof]; (O, K;) sweet and pleasant: so says<br>\
Ibn-&#39; Abbád: (O:) AHn says [of the طرثوث],<br>\
it is like the penis of the ass, and there is no part<br>\
of it more pleasant, nor sweeter, than its سوقة;<br>\
which is in some instances long; and in some,<br>\
short. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also سُوقٌ, last sentence.<br>\

سَوِيقٌ Meal of parched barley (شَعِير), or of<br>\
[the species thereof, or similar grain, called] سُلْت,<br>\

into a kind of gruel, or thick ptisan, being<br>\
moistened with water, or clarified butter, or fat<br>\
of a sheep&#39;s tail, &amp;c.; (see لَتَّ;) and is therefore<br>\
said (in the Msb in art. حسو and in the KT voce<br>\
أَكْلٌ, &amp;c.,) to be supped, or sipped, not eaten:<br>\
but it is likewise thus called when dry; and in<br>\
this state is taken in the palm of the hand and<br>\
conveyed to the mouth, or licked up: (see حَافّق,<br>\
and قَمِحَ:) it is also made of other grains beside<br>\
those mentioned above; and of several mealy<br>\
fruits; of the fruit of the Theban palm; (see<br>\
حَتِىٌّ;) and of the carob; (see خَرُّوبٌ;) &amp;c.:]<br>\
it is also, sometimes, with ص: so says IDrd in<br>\
the Jm: and he adds, I think it to be of the dial.<br>\

following part of a discourse &amp;c.; opposed to<br>\
سِبَاقٌ: you say سِبَاقُ الكَلَامِ وَسِيَاقُهُ (assumed tropical:)  the preceding<br>\
