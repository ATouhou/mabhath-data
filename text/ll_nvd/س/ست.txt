سَتَّهُ, [aor.<br>\
سَتُ3َ, accord to rule, and inf. n. app.<br>\
سَتٌّ, q. v.,] He attributed or imputed to him, or<br>\
charged him with, or accused him of, a fault, or<br>\
defect, or the like; as also سَدَّهُ; syn. عَابَهُ. (TA.<br>\
[The sense in which عابه is there used is indicated<br>\
by the context.])<br>\
سَتٌ a dial. var. of اِسْتٌ: see the latter word in<br>\
art. سته, in two places.<br>\
سَتٌّ Foul, or evil, speech or language. (IAar,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And also, [like سَدٌّ,] A fault, or defect, or<br>\
the like; syn. عَيْبٌ. (K.)<br>\
سِتٌّ: see سِتَّةٌ, of which it is the fem. ―<br>\
-b2-  سِتِّى<br>\
said to a woman means, (K, TA,) accord. to the<br>\
explanation of IAmb, (TA,) يَا سِتَّ جِهَاتِى [O<br>\
thou who occupiest the six places in relation to<br>\
me; or, who art above me, below me, before me,<br>\
behind me, on my right, and on my left]: (K,<br>\
TA:) as though alluding to her holding the<br>\
speaker in her possession: (TA:) or it is an incorrect expression; (K;) or it is vulgar, and<br>\
held in low estimation; (IAar, TA;) and is correctly سَيِّدَتِى [my lady, or my mistress]: (K:)<br>\
it may be regarded as a contraction of سَيِّدَتِى,<br>\
accord. to Esh-Shiháb El-Kásimee: (TA:) and<br>\
Es-seyyid &#39;Eesà Es-Safawee says that it should<br>\
not be restricted to the class of expression used<br>\
as vocatives. (MF, TA.)<br>\
سِتَّةٌ (Lth, T, S, M) and ↓ سِتَّ, (Lth, T, S, M,<br>\
K,) the former masc. and the latter fem., (S,)<br>\
[signifying Six,] are originally سِدْسَةٌ (Lth, T,<br>\
M) and سِدْسٌ; (Lth, T, S, M, K;) the latter س<br>\
is changed into ت, and the د is incorporated into<br>\
it; (Lth, T, S, M, K;) for the dim, of سِتَّةٌ is<br>\
سُدَيْسَةٌ [and that of سِتٌّ is سُدَيْسٌ], and the pl. is<br>\
أَسْدَاسٌ. (Lth, T, S.) You say, عِنْدِى سِتَّةُ رِجَالٍ<br>\
وَ نِسْوَةٍ [I have with me, or at my abode, six men<br>\
and women], i. e., three men and three women:<br>\
and you may say, عِنْدِى سِتَّةُ رِجَالٍ وَ نِسْوَةٌ, meaning, six men, and also women: and in like<br>\
manner you do in the ease of any number that<br>\
can be divided so as to apply to two plurals, as<br>\
six and seven and the higher numbers: but in the<br>\
case of a number that cannot be divided so as to<br>\
apply to two plurals, as five and four and three,<br>\
you put the latter noun in the nom. case only,<br>\
saying, for ex., عِنْدِى خَمْسَةُ رِجَالٍ وَ نِسْوَةٌ. (ISk,<br>\
S.) [Respecting a peculiar pronunciation of the<br>\
people of El-Hijáz, and a case in which سِتَّة is<br>\
imperfectly decl., see ثَلَاثَةٌ and تِسْعَةً.] ―<br>\
-b2-  سِتَّةَ عَشَرَ<br>\
[indecl. in every case, meaning Sixteen,] is pronounced by some of the Arabs سِتَّةَ عْشَرَ: and [the<br>\
fem.] سِتَّ عَشْرَةَ, thus in the dial. of El-Hijáz<br>\
[and of most of the Arabs], is pronounced سِتَّ<br>\
عَشِرَةَ in the dial of Nejd. (S in art. عشر.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
سِتُّمِائَةٍ [meaning Six hundred] should be written<br>\
thus, without separating the two words; because<br>\
سِتٌّ is originally سِدْسٌ and the union of the two<br>\
words is to compensate for the incorporation of<br>\
the د into the ت. (El-Hareeree, in De Sacy&#39;s<br>\
Anthol. Gramm. Ar., p. 72 of the Arabic text.)<br>\
سِتُّونَ [Sixty,] one of the tenfold numbers, (M,<br>\
TA,) namely, that between خَمْسُونَ and سَبْعُونَ,<br>\
(TA,) is derived from سِتٌّ. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also<br>\
Sixtieth.]<br>\
سَاتٌّ [Sixth]. You say, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ سَادِسًا and<br>\
سَادِيًا and سَاتًّا [Such a one came sixth]; سادسا<br>\
being formed from سِدْسٌ; and ساتّا, from سِتَّةٌ and<br>\
سِتٌّ: in ساديا, the [latter] س [of سادسا] is changed<br>\
into ى; for certain letters in other cases are<br>\
sometimes so changed; as in أَمَّا and أَيْمَا and<br>\
تَسَنَّنَ and تَسَنَّى, and تَقَضَّضَ and تَقَضَّى, and<br>\
تَلَعَّعَ and تَلَعَّى, and تَسَرَّرَ and تَسَرَّى. (ISk, S.)<br>\
اِسْتٌ: see arts. است and سته: it is properly<br>\
mentioned in the latter art., being originally سَتَهٌ.<br>\
