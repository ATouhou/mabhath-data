The hanging the [kind of tree, or plant, called]<br>\

to wild bulls, and sending them down from the<br>\
mountains, having kindled fire in the سلع and<br>\

or the loading the backs of those animals with the<br>\
fire-wood of the سلع and عشر, then kindling fire<br>\
therein; seeking to obtain rain by the flame of<br>\
the fire, which was likened to the gleaming of<br>\
lightning. (TA.) [See also سَلَعٌ, where a meaning somewhat different from those above is indicated.])<br>\

in two places.<br>\
سِلْعٌ A cleft, or fissure, in a mountain, (Lh,<br>\
IAar, Yaakoob, S, K,) having the form of a<br>\
crack; (TA;) as also ↓ سَلْعٌ, (S, K,) accord. to<br>\
some: (S, TA:) pl. [of either] أَسْلَاعٌ (Yaakoob,<br>\
S, K) and (of the latter, TA) سُلُوعٌ. (K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also A like, or fellow; (AA, L, K;) and so<br>\
↓ سَلْعٌ: (L, TA:) pl. أَسْلَاعٌ. (IAar, L, K.) You<br>\

سَلَعٌ [originally inf. n. of سَلِعَ, q. v.,] Marks<br>\

-A2-  A certain<br>\
kind of bitter tree; (S, K;) which, in the Time<br>\
of Ignorance, was used in one or the other of the<br>\
manners described above in the explanations of<br>\
تَسْلِيعٌ; (K, TA;) or they used, in the case of<br>\
drought, or barrenness of the earth, to hang<br>\
somewhat of this tree and of the عُشَر to the tails<br>\
ذُنَابَى [a sing. used as a pl.]) of [wild] bulls or<br>\
cows, then to kindle fire therein, and make them<br>\
to ascend upon the mountain; and thus, they<br>\
assert, they used to obtain rain: (S, TA:) the<br>\
author of the K says that J has made a mistake<br>\
in saying ذنابى, in the above-cited passage; that<br>\
he should have said أَذْنَاب; but others had made<br>\
this remark before the author of the K; and<br>\
&#39;Abd-El-Kádir Ibn-&#39;Omar El-Baghdádee says<br>\
that the mistake is to be imputed to these, and<br>\
not to J, who has only used a sing. in the sense<br>\
of a pl., like as الدُّبُرَ is used in the Kur [liv. 45],<br>\
for الأَدْبَارَ: (MF, TA:) AHn cites an Arab of<br>\
the desert, of the سَرَاة, as saying that the سلع<br>\
grows near to a tree, and then clings to it, and<br>\
climbs it, with long, green, leafless shoots, twining upon the branches and interweaving themselves, and having a fruit like bunches of grapes,<br>\
which is small, and, when ripe, becomes black,<br>\
and is eaten only by the monkeys, or apes, not by<br>\
men, nor by the beasts that are left to pasture at<br>\
their pleasure; and adding, I have not tasted it,<br>\
but I think that it is bitter; and when it is<br>\
broken, there flows from it a viscous fluid, clear,<br>\
and having strings: such is the description of the<br>\
man of the سراة: (TA:) or it is a certain<br>\
poisonous plant, (K, TA,) not to be tasted, like<br>\
زَرْع [here meaning wheat or barley] when it first<br>\
comes forth, scantily scattered in the ground, and<br>\
having a small, yellow, prickly leaf, its prickles<br>\
being downy; it is a herb, or leguminous plant,<br>\
which spreads itself upon the surface of the<br>\
ground, like [the plant called] رَاحَةُ الكَلْبِ, having<br>\
no root, and it is not improbable that the ostrich<br>\
may feed upon it, notwithstanding its bitterness,<br>\
for it sometimes feeds upon the colocynth: (Aboo-Ziyád, TA:) or it is a species of aloes: (K:) or<br>\
a herb, or leguminous plant, (K, TA,) of those<br>\
termed ذُكُور [that are hard and thick, or thick,<br>\
and inclining to bitterness, or thick and rough],<br>\
(TA,) of bad, or nauseous, or disgusting, taste:<br>\
(K, TA:) so says Aboo-Nasr: (TA:) [Forskål<br>\
found this name applied in El-Yemen to the<br>\
sælanthus quadragonus: (Flora Ægypt. Arab.,<br>\
pp. cv. and 33:) and the cacalia sonchifolia:<br>\
(Ibid., p. cxix.:) and the name of سَع أَبْيَض, or<br>\
سَلَع البَقَر, to the senecio hadiensis. (Ibid.,<br>\
pp. cxix. and 149.)]<br>\
سَلْعَةٌ A wound by which the head is broken,<br>\
syn. شَجَّةٌ, (S, L, Mgh, Msb, K,) of whatever<br>\

the skin: (K:) pl. سَلَعَاتٌ (Msb, K, [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, سَلْعَاتٌ,]) and سِلَاعٌ, and quasi-pl. n.<br>\

next follows.<br>\
سِلْعَةٌ [A ganglion;] a thing like the غُدَّة, that<br>\
comes forth upon the body, or person; (K, *<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ سَلْعَةٌ, (K,) which is the form of<br>\
the word now commonly known, (TA,) and<br>\
↓ سَلَعَةٌ, (K,) and ↓ سِلَعَةٌ: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K:) or<br>\
an excrescence (S, Mgh, K) of flesh, (Mgh,) that<br>\

غُدَّة, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) that moves about when<br>\
moved, (S, Msb, K,) or moves to and fro between<br>\
the skin and the flesh, (Mgh,) and varies from<br>\
[the size of] a chick-pea to [that of] a melon;<br>\
(S, K;) also termed ضَوَاةٌ: (S:) the physicians<br>\
say that it is a thick tumour, not adhering to the<br>\
flesh, moving about when moved, having a cyst,<br>\
or case which encloses it, and capable of increase,<br>\
because it is extrinsic to the flesh, wherefore the<br>\
doctors of practical law allow its being cut off,<br>\
when it is safe to do so: (Msb:) or a خُرَاج<br>\
[vide suprà] in the neck: (K:) or a غُدَّة in the neck:<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K:) pl. سِلَعٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\

an article of merchandise; (S, * Mgh, * Msb, K; *)<br>\
a thing with which one trafficks: (K:) pl. سِلَعٌ.<br>\

إِنَّهُ لَكَرِيمُ السَّلِيعَةِ [Verily he is generous in respect<br>\
of nature, or disposition]. (TA.) [But perhaps<br>\
this may have originated from a mistranscription<br>\
for سَلِيقَةٌ.]<br>\
سَوْلَعٌ The bitter aloe. (IAar, Sgh, K.)<br>\
أَسْلَعُ A man having the foot chapped, or<br>\
