سَنَفَ البَعِيرَ, aor.<br>\
سَنِفَ and<br>\
سَنُفَ, (S, M, K,) inf. n.<br>\
سَنْفٌ; (M, K;) and ↓ اسنقهُ; (S, * M, K;) or,<br>\
accord. to As, the latter only; (S;) He bound<br>\
the سِنَاف [q. v.] upon the camel: (S, M, K:)<br>\
and the latter, he put to him (i. e. the camel), or<br>\
made for him, a سِنَاف; (K, TA;) thus expl. by<br>\
El-&#39;Ozeyzee. (TA.) [Hence, accord. to some,]<br>\
one says, in a prov., of a person confounded<br>\
or perplexed, and unable to see his right course,<br>\
in his affair, ↓ عَىَّ بِالإِسْنَافِ, (S, Meyd,) meaning<br>\
He was confounded, or perplexed, and unable to<br>\
see his right course, by reason of fright, like him<br>\
who knows not where to bind the سِنَاف: (Z, TA:)<br>\
it originated from the fact of a man&#39;s being thus<br>\
confounded, or perplexed: (Meyd:) a poet says,<br>\
(namely, Ibn-Kulthoom, TA,)<br>\
إِذَا مَا عَىَّ بِالإِسْنَافِ قَوْمٌ<br>\
مِنَ الأَمْرِ المُشَبَّهِ أَنْ يَكُونَا<br>\
[as though meaning When a people are unable to<br>\
find the right way to bind the سناف, in consequence of the affair that is uncertain to be:<br>\
(thus related by Meyd; but in the TA with حَىٌّ<br>\
in the place of قوم, and عَلَى in the place of من:)]<br>\
Az, however, says that this is not the meaning:<br>\
that الاسناف here signifies the advancing, or preceding; and that the meaning is, are unable to<br>\
find the right way of advancing, or preceding;<br>\
(Meyd, TA;) from أَسْنَفَ said of a horse, expl.<br>\
below. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also the next paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
اسنف, inf. n. إِسْنَافٌ: see above, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, i. e. from this verb in the sense<br>\
expl. in the first sentence, (S, TA,) اسنف أَمْرَهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  He performed his affair skilfully, soundly, or<br>\
thoroughly. (S, M, K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also He (a<br>\
horse) preceded the other horses: (S, TA:) and<br>\
اسنفت she (a camel) preceded the other camels<br>\
(K, TA) in going, or journeying, or pace; (TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ سَنَفَتْ. (K, TA.) [See the verse cited<br>\
in the preceding paragraph, and the explanation<br>\
of it by Az.] Said of a camel, it means also He<br>\
put forward his neck, to go on: (K, TA:) or he<br>\
advanced, or preceded. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Said of lightning, It appeared, or was seen, near; and so said<br>\
of the clouds (السَّحَاب). (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اسنفت<br>\
الر ِّيحُ The wind blew violently, and raised the<br>\
dust. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
سَنْفٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
سِنْفٌ A leaf; (M, and so in copies of the K,<br>\
and in the TA;) or leaves: (so in other copies of<br>\
the K:) pl. سِنْفٌ; thus in the copies of the K,<br>\
[like the sing.,] but this requires consideration;<br>\
and it seems that it is سُنُوفٌ, a pl. assigned to<br>\
سِنْفٌ in a sense that will be mentioned in what<br>\
follows: (TA:) [or the pl. is سِنَفَةٌ, likewise mentioned, as a pl. of سِنْفٌ, in what follows, in three<br>\
places:] also (K) the leaf of the [tree called]<br>\
مَرْخ: (AA, S, O, K:) or the pericarp of the<br>\
مَرْخ: (S, M, O, K:) this, says IB, is the correct<br>\
meaning, as those acquainted with the مرخ<br>\
affirm; for, as &#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh says, the مرخ<br>\
has not leaves, nor thorns, but consists of slender<br>\
twigs; it grows in [water-courses such as are<br>\
termed] شُعَب: (TA:) a poet likens thereto the<br>\
ears of horses: (S:) the pl. is سِنَفَةٌ: (M:) or<br>\
the pericarps of any tree having a produce consisting of grains in a long pod, (AHn, O, K,)<br>\
that become scattered, when they dry, from that<br>\
pod, the shale thereof remaining; (AHn, O;)<br>\
one such pod is termed ↓ سِنْفَةٌ; (AHn, O, K;)<br>\
and the pl. [or coll. gen. n.] is سِنْفٌ; (K;) and<br>\
this last has for its pl. سِنَفَةٌ: (AHn, O, K:)<br>\
Aboo-Ziyád says that it is like [the pod of] the<br>\
بَاقِلَّى [or bean], except that it is wider, and<br>\
pointed at the extremity; wherefore a poet likens<br>\
thereto the ear of a horse: (O:) or, accord. to<br>\
AHn, ↓ سِنْفَةٌ signifies any pericarp, whether<br>\
oblong or not oblong; and the pl. [or coll. gen. n.]<br>\
is سِنْفٌ; and the pl. of سِنْفٌ is سِنَفَةٌ: (M:) [see<br>\
also حُبْلَةٌ:] and the shale of the [bean called]<br>\
بَاقِلَّآء, and of the [species of kidney-bean called]<br>\
لُوبِيَآء, and of the lentil, and the like; (IAar, TA;)<br>\
or the shale of the first of these three when what<br>\
was in it has been eaten; (K;) and the pl. is<br>\
سُنُوفٌ. (IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K,) or ↓ سَنْفٌ,<br>\
with fet-h, (IAar, O, L,) A branch, or twig,<br>\
(عُودٌ,) stripped of its leaves. (IAar, O, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And the former, The [grain called] دَوْسَر [i. e.<br>\
زُؤَان, q. v.,] which is sometimes in wheat and<br>\
barley, (O, K,) and which vitiates them, and<br>\
lowers their prices. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. صِنْفٌ [A<br>\
sort, or species]. (K.) One says, هٰذَا طَعَامٌ سِنْفَانِ<br>\
[This is food, or wheat,] of two sorts, good and<br>\
bad. (AA, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A company of men.<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.) One says, جَآءَنِى سِنْفٌ مِنَ<br>\
النَّاسِ A company of men came to me. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O.)<br>\
سِنْفَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
سُنْفَتَانِ and سَنْفَتَانِ Two pieces of wood set upright, between which is put the [pulley called]<br>\
مَحَالَة [by means whereof water is drawn.] (K.)<br>\
سِنَافٌ The [breast-girth called] لَبَب: (K:) or<br>\
the appertenance of the camel that is as the لَبَب<br>\
to the horse or similar beast: (Kh, S:) or a cord<br>\
which you tie to the تَصْدِير [or breast-girth of the<br>\
camel], then you bring it forward so as to put it<br>\
behind the callous protuberance upon the breast,<br>\
[and there, app., make it fast in some manner,]<br>\
and it keeps the تصدير in its place: (As, S, O,<br>\
K:) this is done only when the belly of the camel<br>\
has become lank, and his تصدير has [consequently] become unsteady: (S, O, K: *) or a<br>\
cord that is tied from the hind girth of the camel<br>\
to his breast-girth and is then tied to his neck,<br>\
when he has become lank: (M:) pl. [of mult.]<br>\
سُنُفٌ (M, K) and سُنْفٌ (K) and [of pauc.] أَسْنِفَةٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and a leathern strap or thong, or some<br>\
other thing, that is put behind the [breast-girth<br>\
called] لَبَب, in order that it may not slip [from<br>\
its place]. (M.)<br>\
سَنُوفٌ A horse that shifts the saddle forwards.<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.) [See also مِسْنَافٌ.]<br>\
سَنِيفٌ A cloth that is put, (AA, O, K,) or tied,<br>\
(M,) upon the shoulders of the camel: pl. سُنُفٌ<br>\

are similarly placed upon the hinder parts of<br>\
camels are called أَشِلَّةٌ [pl. of شَلِيلٌ]. (AA, O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also The حَاشِيَة [properly meaning selvage,<br>\
or selvedge,] of a carpet; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K;)<br>\
i. e., its خَمْل [which generally means nap; but<br>\
this addition I think doubtful]. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.)<br>\
مُسْنَفَةٌ A she-camel having the سِنَاف [q. v.] tied<br>\
upon her. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And خَيْلٌ مُسْنَفَاتٌ Horses<br>\
having the [withers, or parts called] مَنَاسِج high,<br>\
or elevated: denoting a quality approved in them;<br>\
for it is only in the best, and the generous,<br>\
thereof: and when they are thus, the saddles<br>\
recede upon their backs; wherefore the سِنَاف is<br>\
put to them, to keep the saddles in their places.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
مُسْنِفَةٌ A mare, (S, M, K,) and a she-camel,<br>\
(M,) preceding others in going, or journeying, or<br>\

مَسَانِيفٌ [being pl. of the latter] signifies the same;<br>\
and is applied to camels: (Th, TA:) or [so in<br>\
the K, but more properly “ and ”] مُسْنَفَةٌ, with<br>\
fet-h to the ن is specially applied to the she-camel, (K, TA,) in the sense first assigned to it<br>\
above: (TA:) or مُسْنِفَةٌ, (K, TA,) with kesr to<br>\
the ن, (TA,) signifies a [youthful she-camel such<br>\
as is termed] بَكْرَة that has completed the tenth<br>\
month of her pregnancy, and whose udder has<br>\
become swollen. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K, TA,) ―<br>\

M,) applied to a she-camel, Lean, or light of<br>\
flesh, (AA, El-&#39;Ozeyzee, M, O, K,) or lank in<br>\
the belly. (AA, M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And مُسْنِفَةٌ signifies also<br>\
Land affected with drought, barrenness, or dearth:<br>\
(El-&#39;Ozeyzee, O, K:) or a year of drought, barrenness, or dearth: [thus expl. as a subst., or an epithet in which the quality of a subst. is predominant:] pl. مَسَانِفُ. (AHn, M.)<br>\
مِسْنَافٌ (tropical:)  A camel that makes the saddle to shift<br>\
backwards; (S, M, K, TA;) wherefore a سِنَاف<br>\
is put to him: (S, TA:) and, (K,) or as some<br>\
say, (S,) that makes it to shift forwards: (S, K,<br>\
TA:) so says Lth: but ISh disallows his explanation, saying that it means a she-camel that<br>\
makes the load to shift forwards; and that مِجْنَأَةٌ<br>\
[a word which I have not found anywhere except<br>\
in this instance] signifies the contrary: (TA:) or<br>\
that makes her fore girth to slip forward; contr.<br>\
of مُدْرِجٌ and مِدْرَاجٌ. (TA in art. درج.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also مُسْنِفَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
