سَنَّهُ, (M, L, K,) [aor.<br>\
سَنُ3َ,] inf. n. سَنٌّ, (M,)<br>\
He (a man, M, L) bit him (another man, M, L)<br>\
with his أَسْنَان [or teeth]. (M, L, K: but in the<br>\
K, with the أَسْنَان.) [Hence, app.,] سُنَّتِ الأَرْضُ<br>\
The herbage of the land was eaten. (L, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And, (M, L, in the K “ or,”) aor. and inf. n. as<br>\
above, (M, L,) He broke his (a man&#39;s, M, L)<br>\
أَسْنَان [or teeth]. (M, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  سُنَّتِ البَدَنَةُ:<br>\
and سَنَّهَا اللّٰهُ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, (accord. to the M<br>\
and L, but accord. to the K “ or,”) aor. and<br>\
inf. n. as above, (M, L,) He pierced him, or thrust<br>\
him, with the سِنَان [or spear-head]. (M, L, K.)<br>\
And سَنَّهُ بِالرُّمْحِ He pierced him, or thrust him,<br>\
with the spear. (L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And He fixed, or mounted,<br>\
upon it (i. e. the spear) the سِنَان [or iron head];<br>\
(M, L, K;) and ↓ أَسَنَّهُ he put to it a سِنَان. (L.)<br>\

above, (M, L, Msb,) He sharpened it, whetted it,<br>\
or made it sharp-pointed, (S, M, L, Msb, K,) and<br>\

L, K:) and سَنَّ he sharpened, whetted, or made<br>\
sharp-pointed, a spear-head upon the مِسَنّ: (L:)<br>\
and he rubbed, or grated, a stone upon a stone.<br>\
(Fr, L.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence,] سَنَّنِى هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ (assumed tropical:)  This thing<br>\
[sharpened my appetite;] made me desirous of<br>\
food. (K.) The Arabs say [also] الحَمْضُ تَسُنُّ<br>\

حمض strengthen the camels [or sharpen their<br>\
appetites] for the [plants, or trees, called] خلّة,<br>\
like as the whetstone strengthens [or sharpens] the<br>\
edge of the knife. (L.) ―<br>\
-b8-  [Hence also,] سَنَّ<br>\
أَضْرَاسَهُ, (M, L, K, *) [aor. and] inf. n. as above,<br>\
(M, L,) He rubbed and cleaned his teeth with<br>\
the stick used for that purpose; (M, L, K;) as<br>\
though he polished them. (M, L.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And سَنَّ<br>\
الإِبِلَ, (ISk, S, M, L,) or المَالَ, (K,) aor. and<br>\
inf. n. as above, (M, L,) He tended well, (K,) or<br>\
pastured and tended well, (ISk, S, L,) or pastured, and rendered fat, or plump, (M, L,) the<br>\
camels, (ISk, S, M, L,) or the cattle; (K;) [so<br>\
that they became in good condition, free from<br>\
mange or the like;] as though he polished them.<br>\
(ISk, S, M, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b10-  And سَنُّوا المَالَ They sent<br>\
the cattle into the pasturage. (El-Muärrij, S, L,<br>\
K. *) ―<br>\
-b11-  And سَنَّ الإِبِلَ, (M, L, K,) [aor. and]<br>\
inf. n. as above, (M, L,) He drove the camels<br>\
quickly: (M, L, K:) or, as some say, السَّنُّ signifies السَّيْرُ الشَّدِيدُ [i. e. the making to go vehemently; السَّيْرُ being here syn. with التَّسْيِيرُ]: (M,<br>\
L:) you say, سَنَنْتُ النَّاقَةَ I made the she-camel<br>\
to go (سِرْتُهَا, S, or سَيَّرْتُهَا, L) vehemently. (S, L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b12-  إٍنَّمَا إُنَسَّى لِأَسُنَّ, occurring in a trad., meaning<br>\
I am made to forget only that I may drive men<br>\
by directing to the right way, and show them<br>\
what is needful for them to do when forgetfulness<br>\
occurs to them, may be from سَنَّ [expl. above as]<br>\
meaning “ he pastured and tended well ” the<br>\
camels. (L.) ―<br>\
-b13-  سَنَّ عَلَيْهِ المَآءَ, [aor. and inf. n.<br>\
as above,] He poured forth the water upon him,<br>\
or it; (M, L, K;) as also ↓ اسنّهُ: (Ham p. 611:)<br>\

or فِى وَجْهِهِ, (Mgh,) aor. as above, (Mgh, L,)<br>\
and so the inf. n., (L,) I [or he] discharged the<br>\
water without scattering upon his face: if scattering it in pouring, you say, شَنَنْتُ: (S, L:) or<br>\
I, or he, poured the water gently (Mgh, L, Msb)<br>\
upon the face, (Msb,) or upon his face. (Mgh,<br>\
L.) And سَنَّ التُّرَابَ He poured the dust, or<br>\
earth, gently upon the ground: (S, L:) and he<br>\

become lean, or light of flesh: and سُنَّ لَهُ قَرْنٌ,<br>\
and قُرُونٌ, An issue, and issues, of his sweat, was, and<br>\
were, made to flow. (L.) سَنَّ عَلَيْهِ الدِّرْعَ, (S, M, L,<br>\
K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (S, M, L,) He put<br>\
(lit. poured) upon him the coat of mail. (S, M,<br>\
L, K.) ―<br>\
-b14-  سَنَّ الفَحْلُ النَّاقَةَ The stallion threw<br>\
down the she-camel (كَبَّهَا, in copies of the K<br>\
[erroneously] رَكِبَهَا,) upon her face. (L, K. *<br>\
[See also 3.]) ―<br>\
-b15-  سَنَّ الطِّينَ He plastered pottery with the clay: (M, L:) or he made the clay<br>\
into pottery. (M, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b16-  سَنَّهُ, (S, L, K,) aor.<br>\
as above, (S,) and so the inf. n., (S, L,) also signifies He formed it, fashioned it, or shaped it;<br>\
(S, L, K;) namely, a thing: (K:) and some say,<br>\
he made it long. (L.) ―<br>\
-b17-  And [from the former<br>\
of these two meanings, app.,] He instituted,<br>\
established, or prescribed, it, i. e. a custom, practice, usage, or the like, whether good or bad;<br>\
set the example of it; originated it as a custom<br>\
&amp;c. to be followed by others after him. (L.)<br>\
You say, سَنَنْتُ لَكُمْ سُنَّةً فَاتَّبِعُوهَا [I have instituted<br>\
&amp;c., for you an institute, a custom, a practice, a<br>\
usage, or the like, to be followed, therefore follow<br>\
ye it]. (L.) And سَنَّ فُلَانٌ طَرِيقًا مِنَ الخَيْرِ, aor.<br>\
and inf. n. as above, Such a one originated [or<br>\
instituted] an act of goodness, or piety, [or a<br>\
good, or pious, way of acting,] which his people<br>\
knew not, and which they afterwards followed, or<br>\
pursued. (L.) And سَنَّ اللّٰهُ سُنَّتَهُ لِلنَّاسِ God<br>\
manifested, or made known, his statutes, or ordinances, and commands and prohibitions, [i. e. his<br>\
laws,] to men: (M, L:) and سَنَّ اللّٰهُ سُنَّةً God<br>\
manifested, or made known, a right way [of<br>\
acting &amp;c.]: (L:) [and in like manner one says<br>\
of any one,] سَنَّ الأَمْرَ He manifested, or made<br>\
known, the thing, affair, or case. (K.) ―<br>\
-b18-  And<br>\
سَنَّ سُنَّةً, (M, L,) or طَرِيقَةً, (K,) [aor. and]<br>\
inf. n. as above, (M, L,) He pursued [a way,<br>\
course, rule, mode, or manner, of acting or conduct or life or the like]; as also ↓ استنّها; (M, L;)<br>\
or ↓ استسنّها; (so in the K;) and بِهَا ↓ استنّ: (K in<br>\
art. سير:) and بِطَرِيقٍ مِنَ الخَيْرِ ↓ استسنّوا [They<br>\
followed, or pursued, a good, or pious, way of<br>\
acting]. (L.) It is said in a trad. respecting the<br>\
Magians, أَهْلِ الكِتَابِ ↓ سُنُّوا بِهِمْ سُنَّةَ, i. e. Pursue<br>\
ye with them the way of the People of the<br>\
Scripture, or Bible; act with them as ye act<br>\
with these; granting them security on the condition of receiving [from them] the [tax called]<br>\
جِزْيَة. (Mgh, L. *)<br>\
-A2-  سُنَّ is also expl. as meaning He, or it, became altered for the worse, or<br>\
stinking: so in a trad. of Barwaa the daughter of<br>\
Wáshik, where it is said, كَانَ زَوْجُهَا سُنَّ فِى بِئْرٍ<br>\
[Her husband had become altered for the worse,<br>\
or stinking, having died, in a well which he had<br>\
descended]: from the saying in the Kur مِنْ حَمَأ<br>\
مَسْنُونٍ: [see مَسْنُونٌ:] but some say that he [who<br>\
used this phrase] meant [to say, or meant thereby,] أَسِنَ, i. e. his head became affected with<br>\
vertigo by reason of a foul odour that he smelt,<br>\
and he swooned. (L.)<br>\
2<br>\
سنّنهُ: see 1, near the beginning. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
سنّن المَنْطِقَ (assumed tropical:)  He made the speech good, or beautiful; (M, L, K;) as though he polished it. (M,<br>\
L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And سنّن إِلَيْهِ الرُّمْحَ, (M, L, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَسْنِينٌ, (M, L,) He directed, or pointed, the<br>\
spear towards him, or it. (M, L, K.)<br>\
3<br>\
سانّ النَّاقَةَ, inf. n. مُسَانَّةٌ and سِنَانٌ, (S, M, L,<br>\
K,) He (the stallion-camel) bit the she-camel<br>\
with the fore part of the mouth: (L:) or he<br>\
opposed himself to her, (M, L,) or drove her, (S,<br>\
L,) or bit her with the fore part of the mouth,<br>\
and drove her, (K,) to make her lie down, (S, M,<br>\
L, K,) in order that he might cover her: (S, M, *<br>\
L, K:) or he covered her without her desiring it,<br>\
or before she desired it, by force. (IB, L.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسنّ, (S, M, L, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِسْنَانٌ,<br>\
(Mgh, L, Msb,) said of a man, (S, M, L, Msb,<br>\
K,) and of other than man, (Msb,) i. q. كَبِرَ<br>\
[meaning He became advanced in age, or fullgrown], (S, L, Msb,) or كَبِرَتْ سِنُّهُ [which means<br>\
the same]; (M, L, K;) as also ↓ استسنّ: (K:)<br>\
but Az says that الإِسْنَانُ in the case of an animal<br>\
of the ox-kind and of the sheep or goat, is not the<br>\
same as in that of a man: for in such animals it<br>\
means [the attaining to the age of] the coming<br>\
forth of the [permanent] ثَنِيَّة [or central incisor]:<br>\
(Msb:) or in such animals it means at least [the<br>\
attaining to the age of] the shedding of the [tooth<br>\
called] ثنيّة [which is generally said to be in the<br>\
third year]; and at the utmost in such animals,<br>\
[the attaining to the age of] what is termed<br>\
الصُّلُوغ or السُّلُوغ [which is in the sixth year];<br>\
and at the utmost in camels, [the attaining to the<br>\
age of] what is termed البُزُول [which is generally<br>\
in the ninth year]. (Mgh, L.) [It is also expl.<br>\
in the K as meaning His tooth grew forth: but<br>\
the right explanation is one given in the Mgh<br>\
and L; i. e. his tooth whereby he became مَسِنّ<br>\
grew forth.] لَمْ يُسْنَنْ, occurring in a trad. of<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Omar, as some relate it, is a mistake for<br>\
لَمْ يُسْنِنْ. (Mgh, L.) And البَدَنَةُ ↓ سُنَّتِ, a phrase<br>\
mentioned by Kt, as meaning The teeth of the<br>\
بدنة grew forth, is also a mistake [for أَسَنَّت].<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also, اسنّ سَدِيسُ النَّاقَةِ The<br>\
[tooth called] سديس of the she-camel grew forth,<br>\
i. e. in the eighth year. (S, L.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, said of<br>\
God, He made a tooth to grow forth. (S, L, K.)<br>\
اللّٰهُ ↓ سَنَّهَا, [referring to the teeth of a بَدَنَة,] a<br>\
phrase mentioned by Kt, is a mistake [for أَسَنَّهَا].<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, in the former half of the paragraph, in two places.<br>\
5<br>\
تسنّن بِهِ [He took him, or it, as an exemplar, example, or object to be imitated]. (K voce<br>\
قُدْوَةٌ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تسنّن فِى عَدْوِهِ He (a man) went at<br>\
random, heedlessly, or in a headlong manner, in<br>\
his running; as also ↓ استنّ. (M, L.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
5 in art. سنه, last signification.<br>\
6<br>\
تَسَانَّتِ الفُحُولُ i. q. تَكَادَمَت [meaning The<br>\
stallion-camels bit one another with the fore part<br>\
of the mouth]. (L, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
استنّ He rubbed and cleaned his teeth with<br>\
the سِوَاك [or piece of stick used for that purpose];<br>\
(S, M, L, K;) he made use of the سِوَاك, passing<br>\
it over his teeth. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He took, or<br>\
seized, with the teeth. (KL.)<br>\
-A2-  استنّت العَيْنُ<br>\
The eye poured forth its tears. (M, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
استنّ said of the blood of a wound made with a<br>\
spear or the like, It issued in a gush. (AZ, L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Said of the سَرَاب [or mirage], It was, or<br>\
became, in a state of commotion, went to and<br>\
fro, or quivered. (M, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Said of a horse,<br>\
i. q. قَمَصَ [app. as meaning He pranced, leaped,<br>\
sprang, or bounded]: (S, K:) he frisked; or was<br>\
brisk, lively, or sprightly: he ran, in his friskiness, briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness, in one<br>\
direction: he ran, by reason of his friskiness,<br>\
briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness, a heat, or two<br>\
heats, without a rider upon him: (L:) he ran to<br>\
and fro, by reason of briskness, liveliness, or<br>\
sprightliness: from سَنَّ as signifying “ he poured<br>\
forth ” water, and as signifying “ he sharpened ”<br>\
iron upon a whetstone. (Har p. 47.) It is said<br>\
in a prov., اِسْتَنَّتِ الفِصَالُ حَتَّى القَرْعَى, (S, Meyd,<br>\
L,) or الفُصْلَانُ, (Meyd,) i. e. The young weaned<br>\
camels leaped, sprang, or bounded; (S * L;) even<br>\
those affected with the small pustules called قَرَع;<br>\
(Meyd, L;) which are small white pustules, the<br>\
remedy for which is salt, and the butter (جُبَاب)<br>\
of camels&#39; milk: (Meyd:) when the healthy<br>\
young weaned camels do thus, those affected with<br>\
such pustules do the like in imitation, but become<br>\
disabled from doing it by weakness: the prov. is<br>\
applied to the man who introduces himself among<br>\
a people, or party, to whom he does not belong:<br>\
(L:) or to him who speaks with one before whom<br>\
he should not speak by reason of the greatness of<br>\
his rank: and some related it differently, saying,<br>\
القُرَيْعَى [which is the dim. of القَرْعَى]; (Meyd;)<br>\
and القُرْعُ [which is pl. of الأَقْرَعُ, q. v.]: and<br>\
some say that استنّت الفِصَالُ signifies the young<br>\
weaned camels became fat, or plump, and their<br>\
skins became [sleek] like مَسَانّ [or whetstones].<br>\
(L.) And it is said in a trad. of &#39;Omar, رَأَيْتُ<br>\
أَبَاهُ يَسْتَنُّ بِسَيْفِهِ كَمَا يَسْتَنُّ الجَمَلُ, meaning [I<br>\
saw his father] exulting with briskness, liveliness,<br>\
or sprightliness, and brandishing his sword, [like<br>\
as the camel exults with briskness, and lashes with<br>\
his tail.] (L.) See also 5. ―<br>\
-b5-  [Also He took,<br>\
held, or followed, the سَنَن, i. e., road, or way, or<br>\
main and middle part thereof: and he, or it, was,<br>\
or lay, in the way. Hence,] one says, خُذْ مَا اسْتَنَّ,<br>\
meaning [Take thou what lies in the way;] what<br>\
is easily attainable; what offers itself without<br>\
difficulty. (AA, TA voce اِنْتَدَبَ.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See also 1,<br>\
near the end of the paragragh, in two places.<br>\

إِسْتَسْنَ3َ see 4:<br>\
-A2-  and see also 1, near the end of<br>\
the paragraph, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  اِسْتَسَنَّتِ الطَّرِيقُ<br>\
The road was travelled. (K.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
سَنْسَنَتِ الرِّيحُ The wind blew coldly,<br>\
or coolly; as also نَسْنَسَت: so in the Nawádir. (L.)<br>\
سِنٌّ i. q. ضِرْسٌ [as meaning A tooth; in which<br>\
sense this latter word is often used; though it is<br>\
frequently restricted to a molar tooth, or to any<br>\
of the teeth except the central incisors]: (M, L,<br>\
K:) [or, accord. to some, a single tooth; i. e.<br>\
one that is not of the double, or molar, kind; as<br>\
shown by a description in what follows:] of the<br>\
fem. gender: (S, M, L, Msb:) pl. أَسْنَانٌ (S, M,<br>\
L, Msb, K) and أَسِنَّةٌ and أَسُنٌّ, (M, L, K,) the<br>\
last of these mentioned by Lh, and this and the<br>\
second anomalous; (M, L;) or the second is<br>\
allowable as pl. of the first of these pls.; (S;) or<br>\
it is pl. of the سِنَان of the spear; but may also be<br>\
pl. of أَسْنَانٌ as pl. of سِنٌّ applied to herbage upon<br>\
which camels pasture, in an instance to be cited<br>\
in what follows: (A&#39;Obeyd, T, L:) the vulgar<br>\
say إِسْنَان and أُسْنَان, which are wrong: (Msb:)<br>\
the أَسْنَان of a human being consist of four ثَنَايَا,<br>\
and four رَبَاعِيَات, and four أَنْيَاب, and four نَوَاجِذ,<br>\
and sixteen أَضْرَاس: or, as some say, four ثنايا, and<br>\
four رباعيات, and four انياب, and four نواجذ, and four<br>\
ضَوَاحِك, and twelve أَرْحَآء: (Msb:) or the أَسْنَان<br>\
and أَضْرَاس together make up the number of<br>\
thirty-two; the ثنابا are four, two above and two<br>\
below [in the middle]; next are the رباعيات,<br>\
which are four, two above and two below; next<br>\
are the انياب, which are four [likewise, two above<br>\
and two below]; and next are the اضراس, which<br>\
are twenty, on each side five above and five<br>\
below; and of these [last] the four that are next<br>\
to the انياب are the ضواحك; next to each ناب,<br>\
above and below, is a ضَاحِك; next to the ضواحك<br>\
are the طَوَاحِن, also called the أَرْحَآء, which are<br>\
twelve, on each side [above and below] three;<br>\
and next to these are the نواجذ, which are the<br>\
last of the teeth in growth, and the last of the<br>\
اضراس, on each side of the mouth one above and<br>\
one below: (Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán: ”) the<br>\
dim. of سِنٌّ is ↓ سُنَيْنَةٌ, because it is fem. (S.)<br>\
One says, لَا آتِيكَ سِنَّ الحِسْلِ, (S, M, L,) i. e. I<br>\
will not come to thee as long as remains the tooth<br>\
of the young one of the [kind of lizard called]<br>\
ضَبّ; (M, L;) meaning, ever; (S, M, * L;)<br>\
because the حسل never sheds a tooth: (S, L:)<br>\
or, as Lh relates it, on the authority of ElMufaddal, سِنَّىْ حِسْلٍ; [using the dual form of<br>\
سِنٌّ;] and [it may be rendered, accord. to the<br>\
former reading, (assumed tropical:)  during the life of the young one<br>\
of the ضّب, for] he says, they assert that the ضبّ<br>\
lives three hundred years, and that it is the<br>\
longest-lived creeping thing upon the earth. (M,<br>\
L.) A poet (Aboo-Jarwal El-Jushamee, whose<br>\
name was Hind, L) says, describing camels taken<br>\
as a bloodwit,<br>\
فَجَآءَتْ كَسِنِّ الظَّبْىِ لَمْ أَرَ مِثْلَهَا<br>\
بَوَآءَ قَتِيلٍ أَوْ حَلُوبَةَ جَائِعِ<br>\
[And they came; (assumed tropical:)  like the age of the gazelle was<br>\
the age of every one of them: I have not seen<br>\
the like of them for an equivalent of a slain<br>\
person, or a milch camel of one hungry: (I have<br>\
given a reading of this verse that I have found in<br>\
the M and TA in art. ظبى, instead of that in the<br>\
present art. in the S and L, in which سنآءَ and<br>\
سَنَآءَ are put in the place of بَوَآءَ app. for سِنَآءَ, an<br>\
inf. n. of سَانَاهُ, and as such here meaning a soothing, or the like:)] he means that they were ثُنْيَان,<br>\
[pl. of ثَنِىٌّ], because the ثَنِىّ is one shedding [or<br>\
that has shed] his ثَنِيَّة, and the gazelle has no<br>\
ثَنِيَّة [in the upper jaw], so that he is always [one<br>\
that may be termed] a ثَنِىّ. (S, L.) It is said in<br>\
a trad., إِذَا سَافَرْتُمْ فِى الخِصْبِ فَأَعْطُوا الرُّكُبَ<br>\
أَسِنَّتَهَا, [expl. as] meaning When ye journey in the<br>\
land abounding with herbage, enable ye the ridden<br>\
beasts to take of the pasturage: (S, L:) but Az states<br>\
that A&#39;Obeyd says, I know not أَسِنَّة except as pl.<br>\
of the سِنَان of the spear; and if the trad. be [correctly] preserved in memory, it seems to be pl. of<br>\
أَسْنَان; for سِنٌّ [sometimes] signifies the [portion<br>\
of] herbage upon which camels pasture; and its<br>\
pl. is أَسْنَانٌ; one says, أَسْنَانٌ مِنَ المَرْعَى; and<br>\
the pl. of أَسْنَانٌ is أَسِنَّةٌ: Aboo-Sa&#39;eed says that<br>\
this last is pl. of سِنَانٌ, not of أَسْنَانٌ, and ↓ سِنَانٌ<br>\
is applied to the [plants, or trees, called] حَمْض,<br>\
as meaning (assumed tropical:)  a strengthener [i. e. a sharpener of<br>\
the appetite] of the camels for the [plants, or<br>\
trees, called] خُلَّة: [see a phrase in the earlier<br>\
part of the first paragraph:] in like manner, also,<br>\
[he says,] when they light upon what is termed<br>\
سِنٌّ مِنَ المَرْعَى [a portion of pasturage], this is<br>\
termed عَلَى السَّيْرِ ↓ سِنَانٌ [a strengthener, or<br>\
sharpener, for journeying]: this explanation is<br>\
approved by Az, and likewise that of A&#39;Obeyd:<br>\
it is also related, on the authority of Fr, that<br>\
السِّنُّ signifies the eating vehemently: [a signification mentioned in the K as well as in the L:]<br>\
and Az says, I have heard more than one of the<br>\
Arabs say, أَصَابَتِ الإِبِلُ اليَوْمَ سِنًّا مِنَ المَرْعَى<br>\
[The camels have obtained to-day a good portion of<br>\
pasturage] when they have eaten well of the best of<br>\
the pasturage: Z says that ↓ أَعْطُوا الرُّكُبَ أَسِنَّتَهَا<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  Give ye to the ridden beasts what will<br>\
prevent their being slaughtered; for when their<br>\
owner pastures them well, they become fat, and<br>\
goodly in his eye, and therefore he withholds<br>\
himself, with niggardliness, from slaughtering<br>\
them, and this [condition of them] is likened to<br>\
أَسِنَّة [as meaning “ spear-heads ”] pl. of سِنَانٌ:<br>\
[see also أَخَذَتْ رِمَاحَهَا, said of camels, voce رُمْحٌ:]<br>\
or if the pl. of سِنٌّ be intended by it, the meaning<br>\
is, enable ye them [i. e. the ridden beasts] to take of<br>\
the pasturage; and hence the trad., أَعْطُوا السِّنَّ<br>\
حَظَّهَا مِنَ السِّنِّ, i. e. Give ye the possessors of the<br>\
سِنّ [meaning tooth] their share of the سِنّ which<br>\
is the pasture. (L.) السِّنُّ is also used for ذَوَاتُ<br>\
السِّنِّ [The possessors of the tooth] as meaning the<br>\
slave and horses and the like and other animals,<br>\
[collectively, in like manner as خُفٌّ and حَافِرٌ are<br>\
used,] in a trad. of &#39;Omar. (L.) And it is said in<br>\
a trad. of Ibn-Dhee-Yezen, لَأُوطِئَنَّ أَسْنَانَ العَرَبِ<br>\
كَعْبَهُ, for ذَوِى أَسْنَانِ العَرَبِ, meaning [I will<br>\
assuredly make] the great men and the nobles [of<br>\
the Arabs to tread upon his ankle]. (L.) [But<br>\
اسنان in this instance may be pl. of سِنٌّ in the<br>\
sense here next following; so that ذوى اسنان<br>\
may be rendered the advanced in age.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
(L,) (tropical:)  Life; (S, M, L, Msb;) metaphorically<br>\
used in this sense as indicative of its length and<br>\
its shortness; (L;) [for the teeth vary with the<br>\
length of life;] the measure, (K,) or extent, of<br>\
life; (Msb, K;) [the age attained;] used in relation to human beings and others: (M, L, K:)<br>\
of the fem. gender in this sense also, (M, L,<br>\
Msb,) because meaning مُدَّةٌ: (Msb:) pl. أَسْنَانٌ,<br>\

السِّنِّ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  A young man. (S, Msb, K, all<br>\

(M, L;) as also ↓ سَنِينٌ, (M, L, K,) and ↓ سِنِينٌ,<br>\
(L,) or ↓ سَنينَةٌ: (M, K:) in this sense also fem.;<br>\
and [therefore] the dim. is ↓ سُنَيْنَةٌ; (L;) one<br>\
says, اِبْنِى سُنَيْنَةُ ابْنِكَ [My son is the equal in age<br>\
of thy son]: (El-Kanánee, L:) and the pl. is<br>\
أَسُنٌّ and أَسْنَانٌ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A tooth of a<br>\
مِنْجَل [or reaping-hook]: (M, L, K: *) pl. أَسْنَانٌ,<br>\
signifying its أُشُر. (L and K in art. اشر.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
[And (assumed tropical:)  A tooth of a comb.] The Arabs say<br>\
كَأَسْنَانِ المُشْطِ meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Like the teeth of the<br>\
comb] in equality, in respect of any state, or condition: but if they mean equality in respect of<br>\
evil, they say<br>\
سَوَاسِيَةٌ كَأَسْنَانِ الحِمَارِ<br>\
[Equals like the teeth of the ass]; سواسية being<br>\
an anomalous pl. of سَوَآءٌ. (Har p. 39.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The nib, i. e. the place of paring, of a writingreed: (S, L, K:) [and each lateral half of that part;<br>\
for] the writing-reed has a right سِنّ and a left<br>\
سِنّ: (TA in art. حرف:) [and ↓ سِنَّةٌ occurs in<br>\
the K voce جِلْفَةٌ as meaning the point of a<br>\
writing-reed.] One says, أَطِلْ سِنَّ قَلَمِكَ وَسَمِّنْهَا<br>\
وَحَرِّفْ قِطَّتَكَ وَأَيْمِنْهَا [Make long the nib, or pared<br>\
portion, of thy writing-reed, and make it thick<br>\
(lit. fat), and make thy mode of cutting the<br>\
extremity of the nib oblique, and make it to<br>\
incline towards the right]. (S, L. *) ―<br>\

distinct portion] of the head [app. here meaning<br>\

-A2-  [Accord. to<br>\
some,] one says, وَقَعَ فُلَانٌ فِى سِنِّ رَأْسِهِ, meaning<br>\
Such a one fell into [what equalled] the number<br>\
of his hairs, of good, (M, * L, K, *) and of evil:<br>\
(L:) or, as some say, into what he willed, or<br>\
wished, and had authority to decide: (L, K:)<br>\
but this is a mistranscription: (Meyd:) the correct saying is فِى سِىِّ رَأْسِهِ, (Az, Meyd, L,) and<br>\
سَوَآءِ رَأْسِهِ, meaning he fell into a state of enjoyment, or welfare; (Meyd;) the former sometimes expl. as meaning, [he lighted upon, or came<br>\
upon, what equalled] the number of the hairs of<br>\
his head, of wealth, or good: (A&#39;Obeyd, Meyd:)<br>\
or what equalled [the hairs of] his head, of<br>\
abundance of herbage, or of the goods, conveniences, or comforts, of life: (Az, L, and Meyd *<br>\

(Mgh, L, Msb,) as also ↓ سَنَنٌ, (S, L,) and سِيرَةٌ;<br>\
(S, M, L, Msb, K;) whence the saying, سُنُّوا بِهِمْ<br>\
سُنَّةَ أَهْلِ الكِتَابِ, expl. in the first paragraph of<br>\
this art., last sentence but one, (Mgh,) and the<br>\
saying of the Hudhalee [Khálid Ibn-Zuheyr]<br>\
cited in the first paragraph of art. سير; (S;) and<br>\
this is [said to be] the primary signification;<br>\
(L;) whether good, or bad; (M, L;) approved<br>\
or disapproved: (Msb:) or, accord. to Sh, a way<br>\
[of acting &amp;c.] that has been instituted, or pursued, by former people, and has become one pursued by those after them; and this, he says, is<br>\
the primary signification: (L:) it signifies also<br>\
[particularly] a way of acting &amp;c. that is commended, or approved, and right; wherefore one<br>\
says, فُلَانٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ السُّنَّةِ [Such a one is of the<br>\
people of the commended and right way of<br>\
acting &amp;c.; generally meaning, of those who<br>\
follow the institutes, or ways, of the Prophet];<br>\

or any other person who is an authority in<br>\
matters of religion, namely, any prophet, or a<br>\
Companion of Mohammad, (see Kull p. 203,)<br>\
as handed down by tradition:] when used unrestrictedly in matters of the law, السُّنَّةُ means<br>\
only what the Prophet [Mohammad] has commanded, and what has been handed down from<br>\
him by tradition, [or, as in the JM, and what<br>\
he forbade,] and what he has invited to do, by<br>\
word or deed, of such things as are not mentioned<br>\
in the Kur-án; wherefore one says, in speaking<br>\
of the directions, or evidences, of the law, الكِتَابُ<br>\
وَالسُّنَّةُ meaning the Kur-án and the Traditions:<br>\
(L:) [thus used, it may be rendered the institutes<br>\
of the Prophet; or his rule or usage:] or in the<br>\
law it signifies the way of acting &amp;c. that is pursued in religion without being made obligatory,<br>\
or necessary; it is what the Prophet persevered<br>\
in doing, or observing, with omitting, or neglecting, [it] sometimes; and if the said persevering is<br>\
in the way of religious service, it constitutes<br>\
[what are termed] سُنَنُ الهُدَى; if in the way of<br>\
custom, سُنَنُ الزَّوَائِدِ: so that سُنَّةُ الهُدَى [the سُنَّة<br>\
of right direction] is that of which the observance<br>\
is a completion of religion, and it is that to the<br>\
omission, or neglect, whereof attach blame and<br>\
misdemeanour; and سُنَّةُ الزَّوَائِدِ [the سُنَّة of supererogatory acts] is that of which the observance<br>\
is good, but to the omission, or neglect, whereof<br>\
neither blame nor misdemeanour attaches, such as<br>\
the ways of the Prophet in his standing and<br>\
sitting and clothing and eating: (KT:) سُنَنٌ is<br>\
the pl. (Msb.) سُنَّةُ الأَوَّلِينَ, in the Kur xviii. 53,<br>\
i. e. سُنَّتُنَا فِى الأَوَّلِينَ [The way pursued by us in<br>\
respect of the former, or preceding peoples],<br>\
means the destruction decreed to befall them;<br>\
(Jel;) or extirpation; (Bd;) or, as Zj says, their<br>\
beholding punishment; (أَنَّهُمْ عَايَنُوا العَذَابَ; [or,<br>\
as expl. in the K, مُعَايَنَةُ العَذَابِ;]) for the<br>\
believers in a plurality of gods said, [as is related<br>\

from Thee, then do Thou rain down upon us<br>\
stones from heaven. (M, L.) ―<br>\

art. ام:) or the side of the cheek: pl. سُنَنٌ. (L.)<br>\
You say, رَجُلٌ قَبَِيحُ السُّنَّةِ A man foul, or ugly, in<br>\

سَنَنٌ مِنَ الخَيْلِ, i. e. شَوْطٌ [app. meaning There<br>\

to which it relates and from what immediately<br>\
