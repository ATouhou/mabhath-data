سَوْمٌ, inf. n. of سَامَ, primarily signifies The<br>\
going, or going away, engaged, or occupied, in<br>\
seeking, or in seeking for or after, or in seeking to<br>\
find and take or to get, a thing: and sometimes<br>\
it is used as meaning the going, or going away;<br>\
as when it is said of camels [or the like]: and<br>\
sometimes, as meaning the seeking, or seeking for<br>\
or after, or seeking to find and take or to get;<br>\
as when it relates to selling or buying. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say, سَامَتِ المَاشِيَةُ (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, TA) or النَّعَمُ (M) or المَالُ, (K,) aor.<br>\
تَسُومُ, (S, M, Msb,) inf. n. سَوْمٌ, (S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) The cattle pastured (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,<br>\
TA) by themselves (Msb) where they pleased;<br>\
and in like manner, الغَنَمُ [the sheep or goats]: or<br>\
went away at random, or roved, pasturing where<br>\
they pleased. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, سام, inf n as<br>\
above, He did as he pleased.] You say, خَلَّيْتُهُ<br>\
وَسَوْمَهُ I left him to do as he pleased. (S, M, K *<br>\
[In the CK, خَلّاهُ وَسَوَّمَهُ لِمَايُرِيدُهُ is put for خَلَّاهُ<br>\
وَسَوْمَهُ لِمَا يُرِيدُهُ; and the like is done in one of<br>\
my copies of the S. See also 2.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\

الرِّيَاحُ, (S,) inf. n. as above, (S, M,) He, or it,<br>\

winds, (S,) passed, went, or went on or along:<br>\
(S, M, K:) or سَوْمٌ signifies the passing, &amp;c.,<br>\
quickly; one says of a she camel, سَامَت, aor. and<br>\
inf. n. as above, she passed, &amp;c., quickly; (As,<br>\
TA;) and hence the saying of Dhu-l-Bijádeyn<br>\
cited in art. عرض, voce تَعَرَّضَ: or the passing,<br>\
&amp;c., quickly, with the desire of making a sound<br>\
in going along. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And سَامَتِ الطَّيْرُ عَلَى<br>\
الشَّىْءِ, (M, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (M,)<br>\
The birds went, [or hovered,] or circled, round<br>\
about the thing: (M, K:) or, as some say, سَوْمٌ<br>\
signifies any going, [or hovering,] or circling,<br>\
round about. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  [As mentioned in the first<br>\
sentence of this art.,] سَوْمٌ is also in selling and<br>\
buying. (S.) You say, سام السِّلْعَةَ, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
aor. and inf. n. as above, (Msb,) He (the seller)<br>\
offered the commodity, or article of merchandise,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) and it is also said of the purchaser,<br>\
like ↓ اِسْتَامَهَا, (Mgh, Msb,) meaning he sought to<br>\
obtain the sale of the commodity, or article of<br>\
merchandise: and one says also of the seller, and<br>\
of the purchaser, سام بِالسِّلْعَةِ, meaning he mentioned the price of the commodity [in offering it<br>\
for sale, and in offering to purchase it]: (Msb:)<br>\
and in like manner, سُمْتُ فُلَانًا سِلْعَتِى, inf. n. as<br>\
above, I said to such a one, “Wilt thou take [or<br>\
purchase] my commodity for such a price? ”<br>\
(TA:) and سَامَنِى بِسِلْعَتِهِ he (the seller, Msb)<br>\
mentioned to me the price of his commodity [in<br>\
offering it for sale]: (Msb, TA:) [and, agreeably<br>\
with these explanations,] Kr says that السَّوْمُ signifies العَرْضُ [i. e. the act of offering, &amp;c.]: (M,<br>\
TA:) or سُمْتُ بِالسِّلْعَةِ, inf. n. سَوْمٌ (M, K) and<br>\
سُوَامٌ, with damm; (K, TK; [in the former only<br>\
said to be syn. with سَوْمٌ in selling and buying;])<br>\
and ↓ سَاوَمْتُ, (M, K,) inf. n. سِوَامٌ; (TA;) and<br>\
بِهَا ↓ اِسْتَمْتُ and عَلَيْهَا; signify غَالَيْتُ [which<br>\
means I offered the commodity for sale, mentioning its price, and was exorbitant in my demand:<br>\
and also I purchased the commodity for a dear,<br>\
or an excessive, price: and both these meanings<br>\
are app. here intended]: (M, K, TA:) and in like<br>\
manner, السِّلْعَةَ ↓ اِسْتَمْتُهُ [I offered to him the<br>\
commodity for sale, &amp;c.: and I purchased of<br>\
him the commodity, &amp;c.]: (TA:) or, as some<br>\
say, (so in the TA, but in the M and K “ and,”)<br>\
this last, as also عَلَى السِّلْعَةِ, ↓ اِسْتَمْتُهُ, means<br>\
↓ سَأَلْتُهُ سَوْمَهَا [i. e. I asked him the price at which<br>\
the commodity was to be sold]: (M, K, TA:)<br>\
and سَامَنِيهَا, (M,) or ↓ سَاوَمَنِيهَا, (TA, [but the<br>\
former is app. the right,]) means ↓ ذَكَرَ لِى سَوْمَهَا<br>\
[i. e. he mentioned to me the price at which it was<br>\
to be sold]: (M, TA:) you say also, عَلَيْهِ ↓ اِسْتَمْتُ<br>\
بِسِلْعَتِى when you mention the price of the commodity [i. e. it means I mentioned to him the<br>\
price at which I would sell my commodity]: and<br>\
you say, مِنِّى سِلْعَتِى ↓ اِسْتَامَ when he is the person<br>\
who offers to thee the price [i. e. it means he<br>\
offered to me a price for my commodity; or he<br>\
sought to obtain from me the sale of my commodity<br>\
by offering a price for it]: (TA:) and عَلَىَّ ↓ اِسْتَامَ<br>\
he contended [by bidding] against me in a sale:<br>\
(S, * PS:) or عَلَىَّ السِّلْعَةَ ↓ اِسْتَامَ, which means<br>\
استام عَلَى سَوْمِى [i. e. he sought to obtain the sale<br>\
of the commodity in opposition to me, or to my<br>\
seeking it]. (Msb. [See also 3.]) Hence, [Mo-<br>\
hammad is related to have said,] لَا يَسُومُ الرَّجُلُ عَلَى<br>\
سَوْمِ أَخِيهِ, (Mgh,) or لايسوم أَحَدُكُمْ على سوم<br>\
اخيه, (Msb,) i. e. [The man, or any one of you,]<br>\
shall not purchase [in opposition to his brother]:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) and it may mean shall not sell; the<br>\
case being that of a man&#39;s offering to the purchaser his commodity for a certain price, and<br>\
another&#39;s then saying, “I have the like thereof<br>\
for less than this price: ” so that the prohibition<br>\
relates in common to the seller and the buyer:<br>\
(M:) and the saying is also related otherwise, i. e.<br>\
↓ لَايَسْتَامُ, meaning shall not purchase. (Mgh.)<br>\
And it is said in a trad., نَهَى عَنِ السَّوْمِ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ<br>\
الشَّمْسِ, meaning, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, أَنْ<br>\
بِسِلْعَتِهِ ↓ يُسَاوِمَ [i. e. He (Mohammad) forbade<br>\
the offering a commodity for sale before the rising<br>\
of the sun]; because that is a time in which God<br>\
is to be praised, and one should not be diverted<br>\
by other occupation: or, he says, it may mean<br>\
the pasturing of camels; because, before sunrise,<br>\
when the pasturage is moist with dew, it occasions<br>\
a fatal disease. (TA.) You say also, سُمْتُكَ<br>\
حَسَنَةً ↓ بَعِيرَكَ سِيمَةً [I have mentioned to thee a<br>\
good price for thy camel]. (S.) And فِيهِ ↓ اِسْتَامَ<br>\
غَالِيَةً ↓ سِيمَةً [He demanded for it a dear price].<br>\
(TA in art. حثر.) And سَامَهُ بِعَمَلٍ [He made to<br>\
him an offer of working, mentioning the rate of<br>\
payment; or bargained, or contracted, with him<br>\
for work]. (K in art. عمل. [See also 3.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
The Arabs also say, عَرَضَ عَلَىَّ سَوْمَ عَالَّةٍ [He<br>\
offered to me in the manner of offering water to<br>\
camels taking a second draught]; meaning like<br>\
the saying of the vulgar, عَرْضَ سَابِرِىٍّ: (Ks, TA:<br>\
[see art. سبر:]) a prov. applied to him who offers<br>\
to thee that of which thou hast no need. (Sh, TA.<br>\
[See also art. عل; and see Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov.<br>\
ii. 84.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And you say, سَامَهُ الأمْرَ, (M, K,)<br>\
aor. as above, (TA,) inf. n. سَوْمٌ, (M, TA,) He<br>\
imposed upon him, or made him to undertake, the<br>\
affair, as a task, or in spite of difficulty or<br>\
trouble or inconvenience; or he ordered, required,<br>\
or constrained, him to do the thing, it being difficult or troublesome or inconvenient: (M, K, TA:)<br>\
or he brought upon him the affair, or event;<br>\
(Zj, M, K, TA;) as also ↓ سَوَّمَهُ, (K,) inf. n. تَسْوِيمٌ:<br>\
(TA:) or he endeavoured to induce him, or incited him, or made him, to do, or to incur, the<br>\
affair, or event: (Sh, TA:) it is mostly used in<br>\
relation to punishment, and evil, (Zj, M, K, TA,)<br>\
and wrong-doing: and hence the saying in the<br>\
Kur [ii. 46 and vii. 137 and xiv. 6], يَسُومُونَكُمْ<br>\
سُوْءَ الْعَذَابِ They bringing upon you evil punish-<br>\
ment or torment: (Zj, M, TA:) or seeking, or<br>\
desiring, for you evil punishment: (Ksh and Bd<br>\
in ii. 46:) or endeavouring to induce you to incur<br>\
it: (Ksh ibid.:) from سَامَهُ خَسْفًا [expl. by what<br>\
here follows]. (Ksh and Bd ibid.) You say,<br>\
سُمْتُهُ خَسْفًا I brought upon him خَسْف [i. e.<br>\
wrong, or wrong treatment, as expl. in the Ksh<br>\
and by Bd ubi suprà]: or I endeavoured to<br>\
induce him to incur it (أَرَدْتُهُ عَلَيْهِ): (S:) [see also<br>\
خَسْفٌ: and سُمْتُهُ خُطَّةَ خَسْفٍ; expl. in art. خط:]<br>\
and سِيمَ الخَسْفَ He was constrained to incur, or<br>\
to do, what is termed الخَسْف [meaning abasement<br>\
or ignominy, or that which was difficult]: (TA:)<br>\
and سُمْتُهُ ذُلًّا I abased him. (Msb.)<br>\
-A3-  سَامَهُ, aor.<br>\
as above, also signifies He kept, or clave, to it,<br>\
not quitting it. (M, * TA.)<br>\
-A4-  See also 4.<br>\
2<br>\
سوّم الخَيْلَ, (S, K,) or الإِبِلَ, (M,) [inf n.<br>\
تَسْوِيمٌ,] He sent forth (S, M, K) the horses, (S,<br>\
K,) or the camels, (M,) [sometimes meaning] to<br>\
the pasturage, to pasture where they would. (TA.<br>\
[See also 4.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] سوّمهُ means خَلَّاهُ وَسَوْمَهُ,<br>\
(AZ, S, M, K,) i. e. [He left him] to do as he<br>\
pleased; namely, a man. (AZ, S, K. [In the<br>\
CK is a mistranscription in this place, before<br>\
mentioned: see 1, fourth sentence.]) Whence the<br>\
prov., عَبْدٌ وَسُوِّمَ A slave, and he has been left to<br>\
do as he pleases. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And سَوَّمْتُ فُلَانًا فِى<br>\
مَالِى I gave such a one authority to judge, give<br>\
judgment, pass sentence, or decide judicially, respecting my property. (AO, S: and in like<br>\
manner سَوّمهُ فِى مَالِهِ is expl. in the M and K.)<br>\
And سَوَّمْتُهُ أَمْرِى I made him to have the ordering and deciding of my affair, or case, to do what<br>\
he would; like سَوَّفْتُهُ أَمْرِى. (TA in art. سوف.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And سوّم عَلَى القَوْمِ He urged his horses [خَيْلَهُ<br>\
being understood] against the people, or party,<br>\
and made havoc among them. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
تَسْوِيمٌ signifies also The making a horse to sweat<br>\
well. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See also 1, in the last quarter of<br>\
the paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  And سوّم الفَرَسَ, (M, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَسْوِيمٌ, (K,) He put a mark upon the horse: (M,<br>\
K:) he marked the horse with a piece of silk<br>\
(بحريرة [perhaps a mistranscription for بِحَدِيدَةٍ<br>\
i. e. with an iron such as is used for branding]),<br>\
or with something whereby he should be known.<br>\
(Lth, TA.) See also 5. [And see 4.]<br>\
3<br>\
سَاوَمْتُهُ (S, Msb) بِالسِّلْعَةِ (MA) [and فِى<br>\
السِّلْعَةِ agreeably with what here follows and with<br>\
an ex. in art. بكر], inf. n. سِوَامٌ (S, Msb) and<br>\
مُسَاوَمَةٌ, (TA,) [I bargained, or chaffered, with<br>\
him, or] I contended with him in bargaining, or<br>\

price: (TA:) and ↓ تَسَاوَمْنَا (S, Msb, TA *) فِى<br>\
السِّلْعَةِ (TA) [and بِالسِّلَعَةِ agreeably with what<br>\
here precedes] We bargained, or chaffered, for<br>\
the commodity, or article of merchandise, [or<br>\
contended in doing so,] one offering it for a<br>\
certain price, and another demanding it for a<br>\
lower price. (Msb.) See also 1, in three places.<br>\

K,) inf. n. إِسَامَةٌ, (Mgh,) He pastured the cattle,<br>\
or the camels: (M, Mgh, K, TA:) or he sent<br>\
forth, or took forth, the cattle, or the camels, to<br>\
pasture: (S, TA:) or he made the cattle [or the<br>\
camels] to pasture by themselves [where they<br>\
pleased (see 1)]: (Msb:) and [in like manner]<br>\
الإِبِلَ ↓ سُمْتُ I left the camels to pasture [by<br>\
themselves where they pleased]. (Th, TA. [See<br>\
also 2.]) Hence, in the Kur [xvi. 10], فِيهِ تُسِيمُونَ<br>\
(S) Upon which ye pasture your beasts. (Jel.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [And accord. to Freytag, اسام occurs in the<br>\
Deewán of Jereer as meaning He urged a horse<br>\
to run: or, as some say, he marked a horse with<br>\
some sign. See also 2.] ―<br>\
-b3-  اسام إِلَيْهِ بِبَصَرِهِ He<br>\

5<br>\
تسوّم He set a mark, token, or badge, upon<br>\
himself, whereby he might be known [in war &amp;c.].<br>\
(S.) In a trad. (S, TA) respecting [the battle of]<br>\
Bedr, (TA,) occur the words, تَسَوَّمُوا فَإِنَّ المَلَائِكَةَ<br>\
قَدع تَسَوَّمَتْ, (S, TA,) or فانّ الملائكة قد ↓ سَوِّمُوا<br>\
سَوَّمَتْ, accord. to different relations; i. e. Make<br>\
ye a mark, token, or badge, for yourselves, whereby<br>\
ye may know one another [in the fight, for the<br>\
angels that are assisting you have done so]. (TA.)<br>\

-A2-  استام السّلْعَةَ: &amp;c.:<br>\
see 1, in ten places.<br>\
سَامٌ Death: (IAar, S, M, Mgh:) and سَامَةٌ<br>\
[as its n. un.] a death: (IAar, TA:) but the<br>\
former [signifies the same in Pers., and] is said to<br>\
be not Arabic. (TA.) It is related in a trad.,<br>\
respecting the salutation of the Jews, that they<br>\
used to say, السَّامُ عَلَيْكُمْ [Death come upon you,<br>\
instead of السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ]; and that he [i. e. Mo-<br>\
hammad] used to reply, عَلَيْكُمْ; accord. to the<br>\
generality of the relaters, وَعَلَيْكُمْ, but correctly<br>\
without the و, because the و implies participation:<br>\
and it is related of &#39;Áïsheh that she used to say<br>\
to them, عَلَيْكُمُ السَّأْمُ وَالذَّأْمُ وَاللَّعْنَةُ, as mentioned<br>\
in art. سأم: (TA:) the Jews are also related to<br>\
have said [to the Muslims], عَلَيْكُمُ السَّامُ الدَّامُ<br>\
meaning المَوْتُ الدَّائِمُ. (TA in art. دوم: see دَائِمٌ<br>\
in that art.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A kind of tree, of which are<br>\
made the masts (أَدْقَال [pl. of دَقَلٌ]) of ships:<br>\
(Kr, M, TA:) accord. to Sh, (TA,) the [tree called]<br>\
خَيْزُرَان. (K, TA. [And accord. to some copies<br>\
of the K, سَامَةٌ also has this signification, and the<br>\
signification expl. in the sentence here next following: but accord. to the text of the K as given<br>\
in the TA, وَالسَّامَةُ has been erroneously substistituted in the copies above referred to for وَالسَّاقَةُ,<br>\
which, by reason of what precedes it, means that<br>\
سَامَةٌ also signifies the same as سَاقَةٌ; and if the<br>\
former reading were right, the context in the K<br>\
would imply that السامة is also the name of a son<br>\
of Noah, which is incorrect; the name of that son<br>\
being only سَامٌ.])<br>\
-A3-  Also A [hollow, or cavity,<br>\
in the ground, such as is called] نُقْرَة, in which<br>\
water remains, or stagnates, and collects. (K.<br>\
[For the verb in this explanation, which is<br>\
written يُنْقَعُ in the CK and in my MS. copy of<br>\
the K, I read يَنْقَعُ.])<br>\
-A4-  Also a pl. [or rather coll.<br>\
gen. n.] of which the sing. [or n. un.] is سَامَةٌ:<br>\
(M, K:) the former signifies Veins of gold: and<br>\
the latter, a single vein thereof: (S:) or the<br>\
latter, a vein in a mountain, differing from its<br>\
[general] nature; (M, K;) if running from east<br>\
to west, not failing of its promise to yield silver:<br>\
(M:) or the former, (M,) or latter, (K, TA,)<br>\
gold, and silver; (M, K, TA;) accord. to As and<br>\
IAar: (M, TA:) or, as some say, an ingot of<br>\
gold, and of silver: (TA:) or veins of gold, and<br>\
of silver, in the stone [or rock]: (M, K:) En-Nábighah El-Jaadee, (M,) or Edh-Dhubyánee,<br>\
(TA,) uses السام as meaning silver; for he likens<br>\
thereto a woman&#39;s front teeth in respect of their<br>\
whiteness: (M, TA:) and Aboo-Sa&#39;eed says that<br>\
silver is called in Pers. سِيمْ, and in Ar. سَامٌ:<br>\
(TA:) but the meaning most commonly known<br>\
is gold. (M, TA.) A poet says, (M,) namely,<br>\
Keys Ibn-El-Khateem, (S,)<br>\
لَوَ انَّكَ تُلْقِى حَنْظَلًا فَوْقَ بَيْضِنَا<br>\
تَدَحْرَجَ عَنْ ذِى سَامِهِ المُتَقَارِبِ<br>\
(S, M,) [i. e. If thou threwest colocynths upon<br>\
our helmets, they would roll along from what is<br>\
gilded thereof, they being near together: لَوَ انَّكَ<br>\
is for لَوْ أَنَّكَ: and] the ه in سَامِهِ relates to the<br>\
بيض [which are described as] gilded therewith:<br>\
(S:) the poet is describing the party as being<br>\
close together in fight, so that colocynths, notwithstanding their smoothness and the evenness<br>\
of their parts, if they fell upon their heads, would<br>\
not reach the ground. (Th, S, * M.)<br>\
سَوْمٌ [is originally an inf. n.: see 1, passim:<br>\
-A2-<br>\
and is also used as a subst. signifying The price<br>\
of any commodity, or article of merchandise; like<br>\
↓ سِيمَةٌ and ↓ سُومَةٌ]. You say, سَأَلْتُهُ سَوْمَهَا, and<br>\
ذَكَرَ لِى سَوْمَهَا, referring to a سِلْعَة [or commodity]: see 1, in the former half of the paragraph. And حَسَنَةً ↓ سُمْتُكَ بَعِيرَكَ سِيمَةً, and اِسْتَامَ<br>\
غَالِيَةً ↓ فِيهِ سِيمَةً: see again 1, in the latter half of<br>\
the paragraph. And ↓ إِنَّهُ لَغَالِى السِّيمَةِ (S, M, K)<br>\
and ↓ السُّومَةِ, meaning السَّوْمِ [i. e. Verily it is<br>\
dear in price]. (M, K.) ↓ سِيمَةٌ and ↓ سُومَةٌ are<br>\
both substs. from سَامَ as used in the phrase سَامَنِى<br>\
الرَّجُلُ بِسِلْعَتِهِ [and the like]; (TA;) syn. with<br>\
قِيمَةٌ. (Har p. 435 in explanation of the former.)<br>\
سَامَةٌ [as n. un. of سَامٌ: see the latter, first sentence, and last but one.<br>\
-A2-  Also] A حَفْر, (M, and<br>\
so in copies of the K,) or حُفْرَة, (K accord. to the<br>\
TA,) [i. e. hollow dug in the ground, app. to be<br>\
filled with water for cattle,] by a well (عَلَى رَكِيَّةٍ):<br>\
its pl. is سِيَمٌ [originally سِوَمٌ]: and you say,<br>\
↓ أَسَامَهَا, (M, K, TA,) inf. n. إِسَامَةٌ, meaning He<br>\
dug it [i. e. the سامة]. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also i. q. سَاقَةٌ<br>\
[q. v.], (K, accord. to the TA, [as mentioned<br>\
above, see سَامٌ,]) on the authority of IAar. (TA.)<br>\
سُومَةٌ; see سَوْمٌ, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  Also, (S,<br>\
M, K,) and ↓ سِيمَةٌ (M, K) and ↓ سِيمَى, also<br>\
written سِيمَا, (S, M, K, TA, but omitted in some<br>\
copies of the K,) and ↓ سِيمَآءُ and ↓ سِيمِيَآءُ, (S, M,<br>\
K,) the last mentioned by As, (TA,) [and it<br>\
occurs with tenween by poetic license, being properly like كِبْرِيَآءُ, a rare form, q. v.,] A mark,<br>\
sign, token, or badge, by which a thing is known,<br>\
(S, * M, K,) or by which the good is known from<br>\
the bad: (TA:) accord. to J, (TA,) the سُومَة is<br>\
a mark, &amp;c., that is put upon a sheep or goat,<br>\
and such as is used in war or battle; (S, TA;)<br>\
whence the verb تَسَوَّمَ [q. v.]: (S:) and accord.<br>\
to IAar the ↓ سِيمَة is a mark upon the wool of<br>\
sheep; and its pl. is سِيَمٌ: [see also سِمَةٌ, in art.<br>\
وسم:] accord. to IDrd, one says, ↓ عَلَيْهِ سِيمَى<br>\
حَسَنَةً, meaning Upon him, or it, is a good mark<br>\
&amp;c.; and it is from وَسَمْتُ, aor. أَسِمُ; being originally وِسْمَى; the و being transposed, and<br>\
changed into ى because of the kesreh before it:<br>\
(TA:) this form occurs in the Kur [xlviii. 29],<br>\
where it is said, سِيمَا هُمْ فِى وُجُوهِهِمْ [Their mark<br>\
is upon their faces; and in several other places<br>\
thereof]. (S.)<br>\
سِيمَةٌ: see سَوْمٌ, in five places:<br>\
-A2-  and see also<br>\
سُومَةٌ, in two places. [For the meanings “ pactus ”<br>\
and “ pastum missus,” assigned to it by Golius,<br>\
as from the S, and copied by Freytag, I find no<br>\
foundation.]<br>\
سِيمَى, also written سِيمَا: see سُومَةٌ, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
سِيمَآءُ: see سُومَةٌ.<br>\
سِيمِيَآءُ: see سُومَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [In the present day it is<br>\
applied to Natural magic: from the Pers. سِيمْيَا.]<br>\
سَوَامٌ: see سَائِمٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also Two small hollows<br>\
(نُقْرَتَانِ) beneath the eye of the horse. (K.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
[And accord. to Freytag, it occurs in the Deewán<br>\
el-Hudhaleeyeen in a sense which he explains by<br>\
“ Malum ” (an evil, &amp;c.).]<br>\
سُوَامٌ [The offering a commodity for sale, &amp;c.:<br>\
see 1.<br>\
-A2-  Also] A certain bird. (K.)<br>\
لَاسِيَّمَا: see art. سوى.<br>\
سَائِمٌ [Going, or going away, engaged, or occupied, in seeking, or in seeking for or after, or in<br>\
seeking to find and take or to get, a thing: (see 1,<br>\
first sentence:)] going away at random, or roving,<br>\
wherever he will. (TA.) And [particularly], (S,)<br>\
as also ↓ سَوَامٌ (As, S, M, K) and سَائِمَةٌ, (As, S, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) Cattle, (مَالٌ, S, TA, or مَاشِيَةٌ,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) or camels, (As, M, K, TA,) and<br>\
sheep or goats, (TA,) pasturing (S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K, TA) by themselves (Msb) where they<br>\
please; (TA;) or sent forth to pasture, and not<br>\
fed with fodder among the family [to whom they<br>\
belong]; (As, Mgh, TA;) or pasturing in the<br>\
deserts, left to go and pasture where they will:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. of سَائِمٌ and of سَائِمَةٌ is سَوَائِمُ: (S:)<br>\
the pass. part. n. مُسَامٌ is not used. (Msb.) It is<br>\
said in a trad., فِى سَائِمَةِ الغَنَمِ زَكَاةٌ [In the case<br>\
of pasturing sheep or goats, there is a poor-rate].<br>\
(TA.) And in another trad., السَّائِمَةُ جُبَارٌ, i. e.<br>\
The beast (دَابَّة) that is sent away into its place of<br>\
pasture, if it hurt a human being, the injury committed by it is a thing for which no mulct is<br>\
exacted. (TA.) And it is related in a trad. respecting the emigration to Abyssinia, that the<br>\
Nejáshee said to those who had emigrated to his<br>\
country, اُمْكُثُوا فَأَنْتُمْ سُيُومٌ بِأَرَضِى, i. e. [Tarry ye,<br>\
and ye will be] secure [in my land]: IAth says<br>\
that thus it is explained: and سيوم is [said to be]<br>\
an Abyssinian word: it is related also with fet-h<br>\
to the س: and some say that سُيُومٌ is pl. of سَائِمٌ<br>\
[like as شُهُودٌ is said to be of شَاهِدٌ]; i. e., ye shall<br>\
rove (تَسُومُونَ) in my country like the sheep, or<br>\
goats, pasturing where they please (كَالغَنَمِ السَّائِمَةِ),<br>\
no one opposing you: (TA:) or, as some relate<br>\
the trad., it is شُيُومٌ. (TA in art. شيم.)<br>\
[<br>\
مَسَامٌ A place where cattle pasture by themselves where they please; a place where they rove<br>\
about, pasturing: like أَرْضٌ مُسْتَامَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Freytag<br>\
explains it as meaning A place of passage: ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
and A quick passage: from the Deewán el-Hudhaleeyeen.]<br>\
مَسَامَةٌ A wide and thick piece of wood at the<br>\
bottom of the قَاعِدَتَانِ [or two side-posts] of the<br>\
door. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A staff in the fore part of<br>\
the [women&#39;s camel-vehicle called] هَوْدَج. (K.)<br>\
الخَيْلُ المُسَوَّمَةُ means The pastured horses: (S,<br>\
Msb, TA:) or the horses sent forth with their<br>\
riders upon them: (AZ, Az, Msb, TA:) or it<br>\
means, (TA,) or means also, (S, Msb,) the marked<br>\
horses; (S, Msb, TA;) marked by a colour<br>\
differing from the rest of the colour; or by<br>\
branding: (TA:) or the horses of goodly make.<br>\
(Ham p. 62, and TA. [See the Kur iii. 12.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
مُسَوَّمِينَ, in the Kur [iii. 121], may mean, accord.<br>\
to Akh, either Marked [by the colours, or the<br>\
like, of their horses, so as to be distinguished from<br>\
others], or sent forth; and is thus with ي and ن<br>\
[because applied to rational beings, namely, angels,<br>\
and] because the horses were marked, or sent<br>\
forth, and upon them were their riders. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And حِجَارَةً مِنْ طِينٍ مُسَوَّمَةً عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ, (S, * M,<br>\
K, *) in the Kur [li. 33 and 34], (S, M,) means<br>\
[Stones of baked clay] having upon them the<br>\
semblance of seals [impressed in the presence of<br>\
thy Lord], (S, K, Er-Rághib,) in order that they<br>\
may be known to be from God: (Er-Rághib:)<br>\
or marked (Zj, M, Bd, K, Jel) with whiteness<br>\
and redness, (Zj, M, K,) as is related on the<br>\
authority of El-Hasan, (Zj, M,) or with a mark<br>\
whereby it shall be known that they are not of<br>\
the stones of this world (M, K) but of the things<br>\
wherewith God inflicts punishment, (M,) or<br>\
[each] with the name of him upon whom it is to<br>\
be cast: (Jel:) or sent forth: (Bd, TA:) but<br>\
Er-Rághib says that the first is the proper way of<br>\
explaining it. (TA.)<br>\
مُسْتَامَةٌ, applied to a land (أَرْضٌ): see 8.<br>\
