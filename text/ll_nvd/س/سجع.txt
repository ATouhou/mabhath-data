سَجَعَ, aor.<br>\
سَجَعَ, inf. n. سَجْعٌ, He pursued an<br>\
even, uniform course; he pursued an even course,<br>\
following one order: this is the primary signification. (TA.) [It seems to be properly intrans.;<br>\
but is sometimes used as a trans. verb, لِ or إِلَى<br>\
being perhaps understood; as in the following<br>\
phrase;] سَجَعَ ذٰلِكَ المَسْجَعَ He pursued, or<br>\
aimed at, that object of pursuit or aim; (K,<br>\
TA;) occurring in a trad. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And It<br>\
was even and uniform, one part thereof being<br>\
like another. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] سَجَعَتِ الحَمَامَةُ,<br>\
(IDrd, S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
سَجَعَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
سَجْعٌ, (Mbr, TA,) and quasi-inf. n. ↓ سِجْعٌ,<br>\
(TA,) The pigeon continued its cry uninterruptedly in one uniform way or manner; or<br>\
called, and prolonged its voice or cry, modulating<br>\
it sweetly: (Mbr, in the “ Kámil; ” and TA:)<br>\
or cooed: or reiterated its voice or cry: syn.<br>\
هَدَرَتْ: (S, Msb:) and صَوَّتَتْ: (Msb:) or رَدَّدَتْ<br>\
صَوْتَهَا. (IDrd, K.) It is said in a prov., لَا<br>\
آتَيكَ مَا سَجَعَ الحَمَامُ [I will not come to thee as<br>\
long as the pigeon cooes;] meaning I will never<br>\
come to thee. (Lh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  You say also, سَجَعَتِ<br>\
النَّاقَةُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. سَجْعٌ, (TA,) The she-camel prolonged her yearning cry in one uniform<br>\
manner. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And سَجَعَتِ القَوْسُ (tropical:)  The<br>\
bow prolonged its twang in one uniform manner,<br>\
monotonously. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And hence by way of<br>\
comparison to the سَجْع of the pigeon, سَجَعَ كَلَامَهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  He (a man) made his speech, or language, [to<br>\
be rhyming prose, i. e.,] to have فَوَاصِل like the<br>\
rhymes of verse, without its being measured.<br>\
(Msb.) And سَجَعَ [alone], (S, K,) aor.<br>\
سَجَعَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. سَجْعٌ; (S, TA;) and ↓ سجّع, inf. n. تَسْجِيعٌ;<br>\
(S, TA;) (tropical:)  He (a man, S) spoke, or uttered, [or<br>\
composed,] (S, * K, TA,) rhyming speech or language, (S,) [i. e., rhyming prose, i. e.,] speech, or<br>\
language, having فَوَاصِل (K, TA) like the فَوَاصِل<br>\
of verse, without measure: as is said in a description of Sijistán, وَتَمْرُهَا وَ لِصُّهَا بَطَلْ  مَاؤُهَا وَشَلْ<br>\
وَ إِنْ قَلُّوا ضَاعُوا  إِنْ كَثُرَ الجَيْشُ بِهَا جَاعُوا   دَقَلْ<br>\
[Its water is such as scantily distils, in interrupted<br>\
drops, from mountains or rocks, and its robber is<br>\
a man of courage, and its dates are of the worst<br>\
kind: if the army be numerous in it, they hunger; and if they be few, they perish]: so says<br>\
Lth. (TA.) You say also, سَجَعَ بِالشَّىْءِ, meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  He uttered the thing in the manner above<br>\
described. (TA.) [See also سَجْعٌ, below.]<br>\
2<br>\
سَجَّعَ see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
سَجْعٌ; [originally inf. n. of سَجَعَ, q. v.;] (S,<br>\
Msb, K, &amp;c.;) or, as some say, ↓ سِجْعٌ, but the<br>\
former is that which commonly obtains, the<br>\
latter being said to be a subst. like ذِبْحٌ meaning<br>\
“ what is slaughtered,” unknown, however, in<br>\
the lexicons, and probably one of the instances of<br>\
the elicitations of the foreigners, (MF, TA,) the<br>\
object of him who says that it is سِجْعٌ being app.<br>\
to make a distinction between the simple subst.<br>\
and the inf. n., as in the case of the simple subst.<br>\
and the inf. n. of سَجَعَ said of the pigeon; [see<br>\
سَجَعَتِ الحَمَامَةُ;] (TA;) and ↓ أُسْجُوعَةٌ; (S, *<br>\
K;) (tropical:)  Rhyming speech or language; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
[i. e. rhyming prose; i. e.] speech, or language,<br>\
having فَوَاصِل like the rhymes of verse, without<br>\
being measured; so called as being likened to the<br>\
سَجْع of the pigeon; (Msb;) or because of its<br>\
uniformity, (TA,) and the mutual resemblance<br>\
and agreement of the words which end its clauses:<br>\
(IJ, TA:) or a consecution [of clauses] of speech<br>\
or language, with one رَوِىّ [which is the principal, or only, rhyme-letter]: (Jm, K:*) or it<br>\
consists in the agreement of the endings of words<br>\
[or clauses], in a certain order, like the agreement of the rhymes (قَوَافٍ) [of verses]: (Mbr, in<br>\
the “ Kámil; ” TA:) each clause ends with a<br>\
quiescent letter; and consists of at least two<br>\
words: (Kull p. 208:) [see an ex. in the first<br>\
paragraph of this art.:] you say also ↓ كَلَامٌ مُسَجَّعٌ<br>\
(S) and ↓ كَلَامٌ مَسْجُوعٌ, meaning the same as<br>\
سَجْعٌ: (TA:) the pl. of سَجْعٌ is أَسْجَاعٌ (S, K)<br>\
and , accord. to IJ, سُجُوعٌ, but ISd says, I know<br>\
not whether he have related this from another or<br>\
coined it, (TA,) and أَسَاجِيعُ, (S,) or this last is<br>\
pl. of ↓ أُسْجُوعَةٌ (K) [and is also a pl. pl., i. e. pl.<br>\
of أَسْجَاعٌ, like as أَزَاهِيرُ is pl. of أَزْهَارٌ which is pl.<br>\
of زَهْرٌ, and many similar instances might be<br>\
added, such instances being numerous app. because<br>\
أَفْعَالٌ is properly a measure of a pl. of paucity].<br>\
السَّجْعُ المُطَرَّفُ is That [rhyming prose] in which<br>\
the two words [that end two corresponding<br>\
clauses] agree in the letter of the سَجْع but not<br>\
in measure; as الرِّمَمْ and الأُمَمْ: and السَّجْعُ<br>\
المُتَوَازِى is that in which the measure is observed<br>\
in the two words as well as the letter of the<br>\
سَجْع; as القَلَمْ and القَسَمْ. (K T.) It is said in a<br>\
trad., that Mohammad forbade سَجْع in prayer:<br>\
[but many of the forms of prayer which he<br>\
himself prescribed, and many others commonly<br>\
used by Muslims in every age to the present time,<br>\
are سَجْع, and the Kur-án is a composition of the<br>\
same kind, though some do not allow this term<br>\
to be applied to it, because سَجْع is a highly<br>\
artificial style of prose-language, characterized<br>\
by a kind of rhythm as well as rhyme, and it is<br>\
obviously not proper to ascribe such artificial<br>\
language to God, nor is it proper to use it in<br>\
prayer, wherefore] Az says that سَجْع is disapproved in prayer because it resembles the<br>\
language of the diviners, or soothsayers, but<br>\
that other kinds of rhyming styles are allowable<br>\
in خُطَب and رَسَائِل. (TA.) He is also related<br>\
to have said, إِيَّاكُمْ وَ سَجْعَ الكُهَّانِ (tropical:)  [Avoid ye the<br>\
rhyming prose of the diviners, or soothsayers].<br>\
(TA.) One says also, ↓ بَيْنَهُمْ أُسْجُوعَةٌ [Between<br>\
them is a discourse, or colloquy, oral or written,<br>\
in rhyming prose]. (S.)<br>\
سِجْعٌ: see سَجَعَتِ الحَمَامَةُ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see سَجْعٌ.<br>\
سَجُوعٌ: see سَاجِعٌ.<br>\
سَجَّاعٌ: see سَاجِعٌ.<br>\
سَجَّاعَةٌ: see سَاجِعٌ.<br>\
سَاجِعٌ Pursuing [an even, uniform, course, or]<br>\
a direct, or right, course, (AZ, S, K, TA,) in<br>\
going, or journeying, (AZ, S, TA,) [and] (tropical:)  in<br>\
speech, &amp;c. (K, TA.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says,<br>\
قَطَعْتُ بِهَا أَرْضًا تَرَى وَجْهَ رَكْبِهَا<br>\
إِذَا مَا عَلَوْهَا مُكْفَأً غَيْرَ سَاجِعِ<br>\
i. e. [I traversed, or have traversed, with her a<br>\
land in which thou wouldst see the face of every<br>\
one of the company of travellers riding over it,<br>\
when they get upon it,] جَائِرًا غَيْرَ قَاصِدٍ [turning<br>\
aside from the right course, (or rather turned<br>\
aside, unless, which is not improbable, the right<br>\
reading be مُكْفِئًا,) not direct], (AZ, S, TA,) or<br>\
not direct towards one point: (TA:) but in the<br>\
O we find, as on the authority of AZ, غَيْرَ<br>\
سَاجِعِ غير جَائِرٍ عَنِ القَصْدِ [which is evidenily a<br>\
mistranscription; the right reading being غَيْرَ<br>\
سَاجِعِ أَىْ جَائِرًا عَنِ القَصْدِ, or the like]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] A face justly proportioned; [symmetrical;] well, or beautifully, formed. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence also,] حَمَامَةٌ سَاجِعَةٌ, and ↓ سَجُوعٌ, (K,)<br>\
without ة, (TA,) [A pigeon continuing its cry<br>\
uninterruptedly in one uniform way or manner;<br>\
or calling, and prolonging its voice or cry, modulating it sweetly: or cooing: (see 1:) or] reiterating its voice or cry: pl. [of the former or of<br>\
both] سُجَّعٌ and [of the former] سَوَاجِعُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And نَاقَةٌ سَاجِعٌ A she-camel prolonging her<br>\
yearning cry in one uniform manner: (TA:) or<br>\
quavering, and prolonging her voice, [in the<br>\
copies of the K مُطْرِبَة, but correctly مُطَرِّبَة,] in<br>\
her yearning cry: (K:) or tall; (AA, K;) but<br>\
Az says, I have not heard this on any authority<br>\
beside that of AA. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [And hence,]<br>\
سَاجِعٌ also signifies (tropical:)  [A rhyming-proser, or<br>\
rhyming-prosaist;] one who speaks, or utters, [or<br>\
composes,] سَجْع: and in like manner, [↓ سَجَّاعٌ<br>\
(mentioned by Golius, and by Freytag as on the<br>\
authority of the K, in no copy of which do I find<br>\
it,) meaning one who speaks, or utters, or composes, سَجْع much: and] ↓ سَجَّاعَةٌ [meaning one<br>\
who does so very much: the three epithets being<br>\
similar to رَاجِزٌ and رَجَّازٌ and رَجَّازَةٌ]. (K, TA.)<br>\
أُسْجُوعَةٌ: see سَجْعٌ, in three places.<br>\
مَسْجَعٌ A place, or an object, [to which latter it<br>\
is applied in a phrase mentioned in the second<br>\
sentence of this art.,] of pursuit or aim; syn.<br>\
مَقْصِدٌ. (K.)<br>\
