-b2-<br>\
سَبَعْتُ لَهُ الأَيَّامَ, aor.<br>\
سَبَعَ, inf. n. as above, I completed to him the days by making them seven:<br>\
and ↓ سَبَّعْتُهَا signifies the same in an emphatic<br>\
manner. (Msb.) [See also 2.] ―<br>\
-b3-  سَبَعَ الحَبْلَ,<br>\
(K,) aor.<br>\
سَبَعَ, inf. n. as above, (TA,) He made<br>\

an animal [generally a goat] sacrificed by way<br>\
of expiation for it, on the seventh day [after its<br>\
birth, (commonly called يَوْمُ السُّبُوعِ,) agreeably<br>\
with an ordinance of Mohammad; the sacrifice<br>\
being for the expiation of original sin]. (IDrd.)<br>\
-A2-  سَبَعَ الغَنَمَ He (a wolf) seized the sheep, or<br>\
goats, and broke their necks, or killed them, or<br>\
made them his prey, (S, K, TA,) and ate them.<br>\

had her young, or young one, eaten by the سَبُع<br>\
[or beast, or bird, of prey]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  سَبَعَهُ He<br>\
stole it; [as though, like a سَبُع, he made it his<br>\
prey;] as also ↓ استبعهُ. (AA, K.) ―<br>\

him [with an arrow or the like], or hurled at him<br>\
and struck him [with a lance, or a missile of any<br>\
kind]; namely, a wolf: or he frightened him;<br>\

―<br>\
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  He reviled, vilified, or vituperated, him;<br>\
charged him with a vice or fault or the like; (S,<br>\
K, TA;) assailed him with foul language, such<br>\

سَبَّعَ اللّٰهُ لَكَ May God give thee thy reward, or<br>\
recompense, seven times, or seven fold. (K, TA.)<br>\
The Arabs also said, سَبَّعَ اللّٰهُ لَكَ أَجْرَهَا May<br>\
God multiply to thee the reward, or recompense,<br>\
for it; meaning, for this good act: (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed:) [for] تَسْبِيعٌ is used by them to signify<br>\
the act of multiplying, though it be more than<br>\
seven fold. (TA.) And سَبَّعَ اللّٰهُ لِفُلَانٍ is used as<br>\
meaning May God make a thing to be followed<br>\

good and to evil; as also تَبَّعَ لَهُ. (TA.) And<br>\
سَبَّعَ اللّٰهُ لَكَ meaning May God bless thee with<br>\
seven children. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He washed it (namely,<br>\
a vessel,) seven times. (K.) Hence the saying<br>\
of Aboo-Dhu-eyb,<br>\
كَنَعْتِ الَّتِى قَامَتْ تُسَبِّعُ سُؤْرَهَا<br>\
[Like her who has arisen to wash out seven<br>\
times her remains of beverage in the bottom of a<br>\
vessel, left by a drinker; that drinker, as is said<br>\
in a marginal note in my copy of the TA, being<br>\
her dog]: or, accord. to Es-Sukkaree, the meaning is, to give as alms her سُؤْر [remains of<br>\
beverage in the bottom of a vessel after one had<br>\
drunk, or remains of food &amp;c.,], thereby seeking<br>\
to have her reward, or recompense, multiplied;<br>\
سُؤْرَهَا being used by the poet for بِسُؤْرِهَا. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  سبّع القُرْآنَ [app. followed by لَهُ or عَلَيْهِ] He<br>\
appointed him the reading, or recitation, of the<br>\
Kur-án [in seven portions so that he should complete the whole] in every seven nights. (O, L, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  سبّع لِامْرَأَتِهِ, (K, TA,) or عِنْدَهَا and لَهَا ↓ أَسْبَعَ,<br>\
(TA,) He remained with his wife seven nights.<br>\
(K, TA.) In like manner one says ثَلَّثَ; and<br>\
thus of every number from one to ten; in relation<br>\
to any saying or action. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  سبّعت She<br>\
(a woman) brought forth at seven months. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  سبّع دَرَاهِمَهُ He made his dirhems to be seventy<br>\
complete; but this is post-classical; (K;) and in<br>\
like manner, دراهمه ↓ سَبْعَنَ, meaning the same,<br>\
and also post-classical, and not allowable; the<br>\
proper phrase to express the meaning “ I made it<br>\
to be seventy ” being كَمَّلْتُهُ سَبْعِينَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
سَبَّعَتِ القَوْمُ The people, or company of men,<br>\
completed the number of seven hundred men:<br>\

a woman. (TK.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The vying with another in<br>\
the endeavour to surpass him in obscene, or lewd,<br>\
language, and in frequency of coïtus, and in<br>\
speaking plainly of such subjects as should only<br>\
be alluded to, in relation to women: (IAar, K: *)<br>\
such seems to be its meaning in a trad. in which<br>\
the doing this is forbidden. (IAar.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  Mutual<br>\
reviling, vilifying, or vituperating; (K, TA;)<br>\
when each of two men assails the other with foul<br>\
language, such as displeases him: (TA:) this is<br>\
said by some to be its meaning in the trad. in<br>\
which it is forbidden. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسبع, said of a party of men, It became<br>\
seven: (S, K:) also, it became seventy. (M and<br>\
L in art. ثلث.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Said of a man, it signifies He<br>\
was, or became, one whose camels came to the<br>\
water on the seventh day [counting the day of the<br>\
next preceding watering as the first]. (S, K.) ―<br>\

abounded with سِبَاع [or animals of prey]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  اسبع الرُّعْيَانُ The pastors had their beasts<br>\
fallen upon by the سَبُع [or animal of prey].<br>\
(Yaakoob, S, K.)<br>\
-A3-  اسبعهُ i. q. أَطْعَمَهُ السَّبُعَ<br>\
[which may be rendered He gave him as food<br>\
the animal of prey, or he gave him as food to the<br>\
animal of prey; but it seems from what here<br>\
follows that the former is meant]: (S, K:) in the<br>\
“ Mufradát,” [he gave him as food] the flesh of<br>\
the سَبُع. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  He gave him, or delivered<br>\
him, (namely, his son,) to the ظُؤُورَة [which<br>\
means both nurse and nurses]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He<br>\
left him to himself; or left him without work, or<br>\
occupation; namely, his slave; syn. أَهْمَلَهُ. (S,<br>\
K.) [See مُسْبَعٌ.]<br>\

سَبْعٌ fem. of سَبْعَةٌ, q. v.<br>\
-A2-  See also سَبُعٌ in two<br>\
places.<br>\
-A3-  السَّبْعُ The place to which mankind<br>\
shall be congregated (K, TA) on the day of<br>\
resurrection. (TA.) Hence the trad., (K, TA,)<br>\
which relates that while a pastor was among his<br>\
sheep, or goats, the wolf rushed upon him, and<br>\
took from them a sheep, or goat, and the pastor<br>\
pursued him until he rescued it from him; whereupon the wolf looked aside towards him, and<br>\
said to him, (TA,) مَنْ لَهَا يَوْمَ السَّبْعِ, meaning<br>\
Who will be for it [namely, the sheep, or goat, as<br>\
aider, or defender,] on the day of resurrection?<br>\
(K, TA:) thus expl. by I Aar, and mentioned by<br>\
Sgh and the author of the L: (TA:) but to this<br>\
is contradictory, or repugnant, يَعْكُرُ, [in the CK<br>\
erroneously written يَعْكَرُ,]) the saying of the<br>\
wolf, (K, TA,) after the words mentioned above,<br>\
(TA,) “ the day when it shall have no pastor but<br>\
me; ” for the wolf will not be a pastor on the day<br>\
of resurrection: or the meaning is, who shall be<br>\
for it on the occasion of trials, when it shall be<br>\
left to itself, without pastor, a spoil to the<br>\
animals of prey: the animal of prey being thus<br>\
made to be a pastor to it: (K, TA:) this is in the<br>\
way of a trope: and accord. to this explanation,<br>\
it may be [↓ يَوْمَ السَّبُعِ] with damm to the ب:<br>\
(TA:) or يَوْمُ السَّبْعِ was a festival of their&#39;s in the<br>\
Time of Ignorance, on which they were diverted<br>\
from everything by their sport: (AO, K, TA:)<br>\
and accord. to one relation [of the trad.] it is<br>\
with damm to the ب. (L, K.)<br>\
سُبْعٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ سُبُعٌ, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
of which the former is a contraction, (Msb,) A<br>\
seventh part; one of seven parts; (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ سَبِيعٌ; (S, Msb, K;) the last not<br>\
heard by Sh on any authority beside that of AZ:<br>\
(TA:) pl. of the first (Msb) and second (Mgh,<br>\
Msb) أَسْبَاعٌ. (Mgh, Msb, TA.) Hence, أَسْبَاعٌ<br>\
القُرْآنِ [The seven sections, or volumes, of the<br>\
Kur-an,] in which one reads: said to be postclassical. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  See also أُسْبُوعٌ, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
سِبْعٌ A certain ظِمْء of the أَظْمَآء of camels;<br>\
(T, S, K;) i. e. their coming to the water on the<br>\
seventh day [counting the day of the next preceding watering as the first]; (K;) or [in other<br>\
words, which have virtually the same meaning,]<br>\
their remaining in their places of pasturing five<br>\
complete days, and coming to the water on the<br>\
sixth day, not reckoning the day of the [next<br>\
preceding] return from the water. (Az, TA.)<br>\
You say, وَرَدَتْ إِبْلُهُ سِبْعًا His camels came to<br>\
the water &amp;c. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The seventh young<br>\
one, or offspring. (A in art. ثلث.)<br>\
سَبَعٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
سَبُعٌ (S, Sgh, Msb, K) and ↓ سَبْعٌ, (Sgh, Msb,<br>\
K,) a dial. var., (Sgh, Msb,) and the form in<br>\
common use with the vulgar, (Msb,) adopted<br>\
also by several readers of the Kur in v. 4, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) and often occurring in the poems of the<br>\
Arabs, (TA,) and ↓ سَبَعٌ, (Sgh, K,) a form<br>\
adopted by two readers of the Kur in the place<br>\
above mentioned, and perhaps a dial. var., (Sgh,<br>\
TA,) The animal of prey; the rapacious animal;<br>\
(K;) [whether beast or bird; being sometimes<br>\
applied to the latter, as, for instance, in the K,<br>\
voce مِخْلَبٌ; but generally to the former:] or<br>\
whatsoever has a fang, or canine tooth, with<br>\
which it makes hostile attacks, and seizes its<br>\
prey; (Msb;) such as the lion, [to which it is<br>\
particularly applied by most of the Arabs in the<br>\
present day,] and also (TA) such as the wolf and<br>\
the lynx and the leopard, (Msb, TA,) and the<br>\
like of these, that has a fang, and attacks men<br>\
and beasts and makes them its prey: (TA:) the<br>\
fox, however, is not thus called, though having<br>\
a fang, (Msb, TA,) because he does not attack<br>\
with it nor take prey, (Msb,) or because he does<br>\
not attack small beasts, nor seize with his fang<br>\
any animal; (TA;) and in like manner the hyena<br>\
(Msb, TA) is not reckoned among the hostile<br>\
animals thus called, wherefore the Sunneh allows<br>\
that its flesh may be eaten, and requires that a<br>\
compensation be made for it [by the sacrifice of a<br>\
ram] if it be smitten [and killed] in the sacred<br>\
territory or by a person in the state of ihrám: but<br>\
as to the jackal, it is a noxious سبع, and its flesh<br>\
is unlawful, because it is of the same kind as<br>\
wolves, except that it is smaller in size and<br>\
weaker in body: thus says Az: but some others<br>\
say that the سبع is any hostile beast having a<br>\
مِخْلَب [or tearing claw]: and it is said in the<br>\
Mufradát to be thus called because of the perfectness of its strength; for السَّبْعُ [seven] is one of the<br>\
perfect numbers: (TA:) the pl. is سِبَاعٌ, (Sb, S,<br>\
Msb, K,) i. e., of سَبُعٌ, which has no other pl.;<br>\
(Sb, Msb;) أَسْبُعٌ is also a pl., (Sgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
but this is pl. of pauc. of ↓ سَبْعٌ, (Sgh, Msb,)<br>\
which, not being a contraction [of سَبُعٌ, but a<br>\
dial. var. thereof], has also for its pls. [of mult.]<br>\
سُبُوعٌ and سُبُوعَةٌ, like صُقُورٌ and صُقُورَةٌ, pls. of<br>\
صَقْرٌ. (TA.) See also سَبْعٌ: [and see سَبُعَةٌ.]<br>\
You say of him who is very injurious, or mischievous, مَا هُوَ إِلَّا سَبُعٌ مِنَ السِّبَاعِ (tropical:)  [He is none<br>\
other than one of the animals of prey]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
السَّبُعُ is also the name of (assumed tropical:)  The constellation<br>\
[Lupus] behind [i. e. on the east of] Centaurus,<br>\
containing nineteen stars in the figure. (Kzw.)<br>\
سُبُعٌ: see سُبْعٌ.<br>\
سَبْعَةٌ, (S, K,) sometimes pronounced ↓ سَبَعَةٌ<br>\
but some disallow this latter, and say that it is<br>\
pl. of سَابِعٌ, (K,) [Seven;] a well-known number;<br>\
and called one of the perfect numbers: (TA:)<br>\
fem. سَبْعٌ. (S, K.) You say, سَبْعَةُ رِجَالٍ [Seven<br>\
men]: and سَبْعُ نِسْوَةٍ [seven women]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
أَخَذَهُ أَخْذَ سَبْعَةٍ: see سَبُعَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  وَزْنَ سَبْعَةٍ means<br>\
Of the weight of seven مَثَاقِيل: (S, K:) one says,<br>\
أَخَذْتُ مِنْهُ مِائَةَ دِرْهَمٍ وَزْنَ سَبْعَةٍ, meaning [I<br>\
took, or received, from him a hundred dirhems]<br>\
every ten whereof were of the weight of seven<br>\
mithkáls. (TA.) [But see دِرْهَمٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  إِحْدَى مِنْ<br>\
سبْعٍ [lit. One of seven;] means (assumed tropical:)  a great,<br>\
momentous, or difficult, thing, or affair: (Sh,<br>\
K: *) an affair difficult to decide: perhaps as<br>\
being likened to one of the seven nights in which<br>\
God sent the punishment upon [the tribe of]<br>\
&#39;Ád: or, as some say, the seven years [of famine<br>\
in the days] of Joseph. (Sh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  السَّبْعُ<br>\
المَثَانِى The Fátihah; [or first chapter of the<br>\
Kur-án;] because it consists of seven verses: or<br>\
the long chapters from البَقَرَة to الأَعْراف [a mistake for الأَنْفَال]; as in the Mufradát: or, as in<br>\
the L, to التَّوْبَة, reckoning التوبة and الانفال as<br>\
one chapter, for which reason they are not<br>\
separated by the بَسْمَلَة. (TA.) [See also مَثْنًى.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  El-Farezdak says,<br>\
وَكَيْفَ أَخَافُ النَّاسَ وَاللّٰهُ قَابِضٌ<br>\
عَلَى النَّاسِ وَالسَّبْعَيْنِ فِى رَاحَةِ اليَدِ<br>\
meaning [And how should I fear men when God<br>\
is comprehending mankind and] the seven heavens<br>\
and seven earths [in the palm of the hand?].<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  See also أُسْبُوعٌ; last sentence. ―<br>\
-b8-  [سَبْعَةٌ<br>\
is also used in a vague manner, as meaning<br>\
Seven or more; or several; or many; as Bd says,<br>\
in ix. 81, and as is indicated, though not plainly<br>\
declared, in the TA. See 2: and see also سَبْعُونَ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b9-  Respecting a peculiar pronunciation of the people<br>\
of El-Hijáz, and a case in which سَبْعَة is imperfectly decl., see ثَلَاثَةٌ. See also سِتَّةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b10-  سَبْعَةَ<br>\
عَشَرَ [indecl. in every case, meaning Seventeen,]<br>\
is pronounced by some of the Arabs سَبْعَةَ عْشَرَ:<br>\
and [the fem.] سَبْعَ عَشْرَةَ, thus in the dial. of El-<br>\
Hijáz [and of most of the Arabs], is pronounced<br>\
سَبْعَ عَشِرَةَ in the dial. of Nejd. (S in art. عشر.)<br>\
-A2-  See also سَبُعَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
سَبَعَةٌ: see سَبْعَةٌ.<br>\
سَبُعَةٌ and ↓ سَبْعَةٌ, the latter a contraction of the<br>\
former, The lioness. (ISk, S, Msb, K.) Hence<br>\
the saying, ↓ أَخَذَهُ أَخَذَ سَبْعَةٍ, (ISk, S, K,) or<br>\
السَّبْعَةِ, (Msb,) He seized him with the seizing of<br>\
a lioness, (ISk, S, K,) or of the lioness, (Msb,)<br>\
which is more impetuous (أَنْزَقُ) than the lion,<br>\
(ISk, S,) or more bold than the lion: (Msb:) or<br>\
the saying is, أَخَذَهُ أَخْذَ سَبْعَةَ (S, K) he seized<br>\
him with the seizing of Seb&#39;ah, who was a certain<br>\
strong man, (Ibn-El-Kelbee, S,) or a certain<br>\
insolent and audacious rebel, (Ibn-El-Kelbee,<br>\
Lth, K,) of the Arabs, (TA,) whom one of the<br>\
kings of El-Yemen seized, and, after having cut<br>\
off his hands and feet, or arms and legs, crucified;<br>\
[so that the meaning is, he punished him with<br>\
the punishment of Seb&#39;ah;] and hence it was<br>\
said, لَأُعَذِّبَنَّكَ عَذَابَ سَبْعَةَ [I will assuredly punish<br>\
thee with the punishment of Seb&#39;ah]; (El-Kelbee,<br>\
Lth, K; *) and لَأَعْمَلَنَّ بِكَ عَمَلَ سَبْعَةَ I will<br>\
assuredly do with thee as was done with Seb&#39;ah:<br>\
(O:) or the man&#39;s name was سَبُعٌ, and it was<br>\
contracted, and made fem. by way of contempt:<br>\
or the meaning of the first saying is, he seized<br>\
him with the seizing of seven men: (K:) and in<br>\
like manner the last saying is expl. by some [who<br>\
say سَبْعَةٍ instead of سَبْعَةَ]. (TA.) The dim. is<br>\
↓ سُبَيْعَةٌ. (Msb.) [See also سَبُعٌ.]<br>\
[<br>\
سَبُعِىٌّ Of, or relating to, an animal of prey.]<br>\
سَبْعُونَ [Seventy;] a well-known number; (K;)<br>\
the round number that is between سِتُّونَ and<br>\
ثَمَانُونَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The Arabs also use it as meaning [Seventy or more; or] many. (TA.) Thus<br>\
it is used in the Kur [ix. 81], where it is said,<br>\
إِنْ تَسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُمْ سَبْعِينَ مَرَّةً فَلَنْ يَغْفِرَ اللّٰهُ لَهُمْ, meaning If thou beg forgiveness for them many times,<br>\
even then God will not forgive them; not that God<br>\
would forgive them if forgiveness were begged<br>\
more than seventy times: (Bd, * TA:) and سَبْعَةٌ<br>\
and سَبْعُمِائَةٍ and the like are used in the same<br>\
manner. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Also Seventieth.]<br>\
[<br>\
سُبَاعَ as meaning Seven and seven, or seven and<br>\
seven together, or seven at a time and seven at a<br>\
time, seems not to have been used; for] A&#39;Obeyd<br>\
says that more than أُحَادَ and ثُنَآءَ and ثُلَاثَ and<br>\
رُبَاعَ has not been heard, excepting عُشَارَ. (TA in<br>\
art. عشر.)<br>\
سَبُوعٌ [app. Wont to frighten]: (TA: [in which<br>\
the meaning here given seems to be indicated.])<br>\
سُبُوعٌ: see أُسْبُوعٌ, in four places.<br>\
سَبِيعٌ: see سُبْعٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and سَابعٌ.<br>\
سُبَيْعَةٌ dim. of سَبُعَةٌ, q. v.<br>\
سُبَاعِىٌّ A garment, or piece of cloth, seven<br>\
cubits, or seven spans, in length. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A<br>\
great and tall camel; (En-Nadr, K;) [as though<br>\
seven cubits in height:] fem. with ة. (K.). And<br>\
سُبَاعِىُّ البَدَنِ, (S, K,) applied to a man, has the<br>\
like meaning; (K;) complete, or full-grown, in<br>\
body; (S, TA;) [or seven spans in height; for]<br>\
when a boy has attained seven spans, he is a man.<br>\
(S, voce خُمَاسِىٌّ, q. v.)<br>\
سَابِعٌ [act. part. n. of 1: generally meaning<br>\
Seventh]: pl. سَبَعَةٌ. (K.) You say, كُنْتُ سَابِعَهُمْ<br>\
[I was the seventh of them]. (S, K.) And هٰذَا<br>\
هٰذَا ↓ سَبِيعُ, meaning سَابِعُهُ [This is the seventh<br>\
of this: not the seventh part; though the former<br>\
has also this latter meaning]. (TA.) And هُوَ<br>\
سَابِعُ سَبْعَةٍ [He is the seventh of seven]. (TA.)<br>\
And هُوَ سَابِعٌ سِتَّةً [He is making six to become<br>\
seven]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  إِبِلٌ سَوَابِعُ [pl. of سَابِعَةٌ] Camels<br>\
coming to the water on the seventh day [counting<br>\
