سَكَبَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
سَكُبَ, (A, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. سُكُوبٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and سَكْبٌ (Msb)<br>\
and تَسْكَابٌ, (S, [this last assigned in the K to the<br>\
trans. verb,]) said of water, (S, A, Msb, K,) and a<br>\
flow of tears (دَمْع), (A, TA,) and the like, (TA,) It<br>\
poured out or forth; or was, or became, poured<br>\
out or forth; (S, A, Msb, K;) as also ↓ انسكب.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  And سَكَبَهُ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
as above, (A, TA,) inf. n. سَكْبٌ (S, Mgh, K) and<br>\
تَسْكَابٌ, (K, [the latter assigned in the S to the<br>\
intrans. verb,]) He poured it out or forth; namely,<br>\
water, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) and a flow of tears,<br>\
(A, TA,) and the like; (TA;) as also ↓ اسكبهُ.<br>\
(A.) The people of El-Medeeneh say, اُسْكُبْ عَلَى<br>\
يَد َىَّ Pour thou out, or forth, upon my hands.<br>\
(A.) And it is said in a trad., هَاهُنَا تُسْكَبُ العَبَرَاتُ<br>\
[Here tears are to be poured forth], meaning<br>\
this is the place in which one should weep, seeking forgiveness. (Mgh.)<br>\

أَسْكَبَ see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\

إِنْسَكَبَ see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
سَكْبٌ and ↓ سَاكِبٌ and ↓ سَكُوبٌ and ↓ سَيْكَبٌ<br>\
(K) and ↓ سَكِيبٌ (CK [omitted in the TA and in<br>\
my MS. copy of the K]) and ↓ أُسْكُوبٌ (K)<br>\
Water poured out or forth, or being poured out<br>\
or forth: or poured out or forth, (K, TA,) running upon the surface of the earth without any<br>\
excavation: (TA:) or the first signifies water<br>\
poured out or forth; and is an inf. n. used as an<br>\
epithet, like صَبٌّ and غَوْرٌ applied as epithets to<br>\
water: and ↓ سَكُوبٌ, water running upon the surface of the earth without any excavation: and<br>\
↓ أُسْكُوبٌ, water pouring out or forth, or being<br>\
poured out or forth; (S;) or, as some say, pouring much: (Har pp. 469 et seq.:) and also this<br>\
last, running water: (TA:) or this signifies<br>\
دَائِمُ الهَطَلَانِ [i. e. continually pouring, or continually pouring dispersedly and in large drops;<br>\
as also سَكْبٌ; for hence it appears evident that<br>\
الهَطَلَانُ الدَّائِمُ as an explanation of السَّكْبُ and<br>\
الأُسْكُوبُ in the K is a mistake for الدَّائِمُ الهَطَلَانِ];<br>\
and is applied as an epithet to water and to<br>\
blood; (A;) and also [probably in this sense] to<br>\
clouds (سَحَابٌ); and to a wound made with a<br>\
spear or the like (طَعْنَةٌ): and ↓سَاكِبٌ is applied<br>\
as an epithet to tears (دَمْعٌ). (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence]<br>\
سَكْبٌ applied to a horse means (tropical:)  Wide in step:<br>\
(S, A, K:) or fleet, or swift, or excellent in running; (A, K;) that runs much: (Mgh, TA:)<br>\
or light, or active: and ↓ أُسْكُوبٌ, so applied, has<br>\
one or another of these meanings: (A:) or the<br>\
former, thus applied, that runs vehemently; as<br>\
also فَيْضٌ; likened to water pouring forth: (EthThaalebee, TA:) also, (K, TA,) applied to a<br>\
horse and a man and a boy, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  light of<br>\
spirit; and brisk, lively, or sprightly, (K, TA,)<br>\
in work, or action. (TA.) السَّكْبُ was the name<br>\
of the first horse possessed by the Prophet;<br>\
(Mgh, * K;) as also ↓ السَّكَبُ: and the name of<br>\
a horse of Shebeeb Ibn-Mo&#39;áwiyeh. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence also,] (assumed tropical:)  A certain sort of clothes, or garments, (T, S, K,) thin so as to resemble dust, and<br>\
as though resembling pouring water by reason of<br>\
its thinness; and so, accord. to IAar, ↓سَكَبٌ. (T,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Applied to a man, (assumed tropical:)  Tall; (K;) a<br>\
dial. var. of سَقْبٌ [q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (tropical:)  A<br>\
necessary thing or affair: (A, K, TA:) and (tropical:)  a<br>\
disgrace (سُبَّةٌ) that is necessary, or unavoidable.<br>\
(A, TA.) Lakeet Ibn-Zurárah said to his brother<br>\
Maabad, when he required him to ransom him<br>\
with two hundred camels, he being a captive,<br>\
نُمِيطُ عَنْكَ شَيْئًا يَكُونُ عَلَى أَهْلِ بَيْتِكَ سُبَّةً سَكْبًا,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  [We will put away from thee a thing<br>\
that would be to the people of thy house] a necessary, or an unavoidable, disgrace. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also Copper, or brass; syn. نُحَاسٌ: or lead:<br>\
(IAar, K:) and so ↓ سَكَبٌ, (K,) in the latter<br>\
sense, or in both senses, or in all the senses. (TA.)<br>\
سَكَبٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, latter<br>\
half, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain kind of<br>\
tree, (S, K,) of sweet odour, (S,) as though its<br>\
odour were that of [the perfume called] خَلُوق<br>\
[q. v.], growing apart from others, upon a single<br>\
root, having a downy substance, and leaves like<br>\
those of the صَعْتَر [a species of origanum, or<br>\
marjoram], except in being more green: it grows<br>\
in the plains and the valleys; and what has dried<br>\
up thereof is of no use to any one: it has a fruit<br>\
which is eaten, and the people of El-Hijáz make<br>\
of it a [beverage such as is termed] نَبِيذ: its fruit<br>\
does not grow forth in one year, but only in<br>\
several years: AHn says that the سَكَب is a herb<br>\
that rises to the height of a cubit, having dustcoloured leaves like those of the هِنْدَبَآء [or endive],<br>\
and a blossom intensely white, of the form of that<br>\
of the فِرْسِك [i. e. peach, or a species or variety<br>\
thereof]: (TA:) n. un. with ة: (S, TA:) As<br>\
mentions the سَكَب as one of the plants of the<br>\
plain, or soft, tracts. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also said to<br>\
be The [plant called] ريح [app. رَيِّح or رِيح<br>\
which seem to be coll. gen. ns. of each of which<br>\
the n. un. is with ة (see رَيِّحَةٌ)], having a yellow<br>\
blossom. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The anemone (شَقَائِقُ<br>\
النُّعْمَانِ). (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And One of the trees of the<br>\
hot season. (TA.)<br>\
سَكَابٌ and سَكَابِ, the latter [indecl., with kesr<br>\
for its termination,] like قَطَامِ, and ↓ سَكَّابٌ, [all<br>\
app. meaning The fleet, or swift, like السَّكْبُ and<br>\
الأُسْكُوبُ,] are names of certain horses. (K: the<br>\
second only mentioned in the S.)<br>\
سَكُوبٌ: see سَكْبٌ, in two places.<br>\
سَكِيبٌ: see سَكْبٌ.<br>\
سَكَّابٌ: see سَكَابٌ.<br>\
سَاكِبٌ: see سَكْبٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  [And act.<br>\
part. n. of سَكَبَهُ. Hence,] سَاكِبُ المَآءِ (assumed tropical:)  [The sign<br>\
of Aquarius;] the eleventh of the signs of the<br>\
Zodiac; also called الدَّلْوُ. (Kzw.)<br>\
سَيْكَبٌ: see سَكْبٌ<br>\
أُسْكُبَّةٌ The أُسْكُفَّة [i. e. threshold] of a door. (K.)<br>\
إِسْكَابٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
أُسْكُوبٌ: see سَكْبٌ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
Lightning extending towards the earth. (K.)<br>\
So in the saying of Zuheyr El-Mázinee,<br>\
بَرْقٌ يُضِىْءُ أَمَامَ البَيْتِ أُسْكُوبُ<br>\
[Lightning shining, or shining brightly, before<br>\
the tent, or house, extending towards the earth];<br>\
as though it were pouring forth rain. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And A row of palm-trees; (IAar, K;) as also<br>\
أُسْلُوبٌ: if of other than palm-trees, it is termed<br>\
أُنْبُوبٌ, and مِدَادٌ. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. إِسْكَافٌ<br>\
[A maker of shoes or boots, or a sewer of leather,<br>\
&amp;c.]; like ↓ إِسْكَابٌ: or a blacksmith. (K.)<br>\
المِسْكَبَةُ [altered in a copy of the A from<br>\
المَسْكَبَةُ, which may perhaps be the right word,]<br>\
The higher, or highest, rivulet, or small channel<br>\
for irrigation, from which the other rivulets, or<br>\
small channels, are supplied with water. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [In a copy of the A (in art. سطب), المَسْطَبَة,<br>\
which I believe to be in that instance a mistranscription for المسكبة, occurs expl. as meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The Milky Way.]<br>\
