سَدِمَ, (S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
سَدَمَ, (K,) inf. n. سَدَمٌ,<br>\
(S, M, K,) He repented and grieved: (S:) or he<br>\
was, or became, affected with anxiety: or with<br>\
anxiety together with repentance: or with wrath,<br>\
or rage, together with grief. (M, K.) [Hence,]<br>\
one says, مَا لَهُ هَمٌّ وَلَا سَدَمٌ إِلَّا ذَاكَ [He has no<br>\
object of anxiety nor of repentance and grief<br>\
except that: or this saying may be from what<br>\
next follows]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سَدِمَ بِالشَّىْءِ, aor. and<br>\
inf. n. as above, He desired the thing vehemently,<br>\
eagerly, greedily, very greedily, or excessively; hankered after it, or coveted it; and he was, or became,<br>\
devoted, addicted, or attached, to it: (TK:) [but<br>\
these meanings of the verb are perhaps only inferred<br>\
from the saying that] السَّدَمُ is syn. with الحِرْصُ:<br>\
and اللَّهَجُ بِالشَّىْءِ, (M, K, [in the CK اللَّهْجُ,]) and<br>\
الوُلُوعُ. (TA.) Hence the trad., مَنْ كَانَتِ الدُّنْيَا<br>\
هَمَّهُ وَسَدَمَهُ جَعَلَ اللّٰهُ فَقْرَهُ بَيْنَ عَيْنَيْهِ [To whomsoever the present state of existence is the object<br>\
of his anxiety and of his eager desire &amp;c., God<br>\
places his poverty before his eyes]. (TA.)<br>\

And سدم, [i. e. سَدِمَ, as is indicated by the form<br>\
of the part. n. سَدِمٌ, and by سَدَمٌ as an inf. n. used<br>\
in the sense of that part. n.,] said of water, It<br>\

standing, and overspread with [the green substance termed] طُحْلُب, and choked with dust<br>\
and other things that had fallen into it.<br>\
(A, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  [And سَدِمَ said of a stallion, He<br>\

سَدُمٌ: see the latter half of the next paragraph.<br>\
سَدِمٌ [is a part. n. of سَدِمَ: and is also app. used<br>\
as an imitative sequent to نَدِمٌ]. You say [سَدِمٌ<br>\
and] ↓ سَادِمٌ and ↓ سَدْمَانُ (M, K, TA) meaning<br>\
Repenting and grieving: (TA:) or affected with<br>\
anxiety: or with anxiety together with repentance: or with wrath, or rage, together with<br>\
grief: (M, K, TA:) and سَدِمٌ نَدِمٌ, in which one<br>\
is used as an imitative sequent to the other; and<br>\
نَادِمٌ ↓ سَادِمٌ, and نَدْمَانُ ↓ سَدْمَانُ, [app. in like<br>\
manner,] السَّدَمُ being seldom used without النَّدَمُ:<br>\
(TA:) or [نَدِمٌ سَدِمٌ, and] ↓ نَادِمٌ سَادِمٌ, and<br>\
↓ نَدْمَانُ سَدْمَانُ; in which one is said to be an<br>\
imitative sequent to the other: (S:) or, accord.<br>\
to IAmb, ↓سَادِمٌ in the phrase رَجُلٌ سَادِمٌ نَادِمٌ<br>\
means, as some say, altered [for the worse] in<br>\
intellect in consequence of grief; from مَآءٌ سُدُمٌ,<br>\
i. e. “ water that has become altered [for the<br>\
worse]: ” or, as others say, grieving, not able to<br>\
go nor to come. (TA.) You say also رَجُلٌ سَدِمٌ<br>\

(S, M, K:) or one that is sent among the she-camels, and that brays amidst them, and, when<br>\
they have become excited by lust, is taken forth<br>\
from them, because what he begets is disesteemed;<br>\
(M, K, TA;) therefore, when he is excited by<br>\
lust, he is shackled, and pastures around the<br>\
dwelling; and if he attacks the she-camels, he is<br>\
muzzled: (TA:) or one that is in any manner<br>\
debarred from covering; (K;) or the last two<br>\
epithets have this last signification. (M.) ―<br>\

up, stopped up, or choked up, with earth or dust;<br>\
or into which the dust has been swept by the<br>\

مُنْدَفِقٌ:]) pl. أَسْدَامٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and سِدَامٌ [a<br>\
pl. of mult.]; or the sing. and pl. are alike; (M,<br>\
K;) [i. e.] you say مَآءٌ أَسْدَامٌ and سِدَامٌ, applying<br>\
pl. epithets to a sing. noun; (Z, TA;) as well as<br>\
مِيَاهٌ أَسْدَامٌ (IAmb, TA, and Ham p. 102) and<br>\
سِدَامٌ (IAmb, TA) meaning waters altered [for<br>\
the worse] (IAmb, TA, and Ham ubi suprà) in<br>\
consequence of long standing, and so سُدُمٌ: (Ham:)<br>\
this last is pl. of ↓ سَدُومٌ, as also سُدْمٌ: (M, TA:)<br>\
[and each of these two is also used as a sing.;<br>\
i. e.] you say also ↓ رَكِيَّةٌ سُدْمٌ and ↓ سُدُمٌ<br>\
meaning a well filled up, stopped up, or choked<br>\
up, with earth or dust; or into which the dust<br>\
has been swept by the wind: (S, K, TA: [in the<br>\
CK, مُنْدَفِقَةٌ is erroneously put for مُنْدَفِنَةٌ:]) or<br>\
into which varieties of small rubbish, and dust,<br>\
or small pebbles, whirled round by the wind, have<br>\
fallen, so that it is nearly choked up: (Lth,<br>\
TA:) and ↓ مَآءٌ سُدُمٌ is expl. as meaning water<br>\
that has become altered [for the worse]: (IAmb,<br>\
TA:) ↓ مُسَدَّمٌ, also, applied to water, signifies the<br>\

prevented from flowing by dust and wind. (Freytag, from the Deewán of Jereer.)]<br>\
سُدُمٌ, as a sing. epithet: see the latter half of<br>\
the next preceding paragraph, in three places. It<br>\
is also a pl. of سَدُومٌ. (M, TA.)<br>\

-A3-  And i. q. كَثِيرُ الذِّكْرِ (K) [app.<br>\

[app. They remember not, or celebrate not, God,<br>\
otherwise than doing so much, or frequently:<br>\
from which it seems that one says, اللّٰهَ ↓ سَدَمَ,<br>\
inf. n. سَدْمٌ, meaning He remembered, or celebrated, God, &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  And i. q. تَعَبٌ [Fatigue: but I incline to think that this explanation<br>\
is a mistranscription]. (TA.)<br>\
