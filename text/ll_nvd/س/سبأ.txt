سَبَأَ الخَمْرَ, (S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
سَبَاَ, (M, K,) inf. n.<br>\
سَبْءٌ (S, M, K) and سِبَآءٌ, (M, K, TA,) like<br>\
كِتَابٌ, (TA, in the CK سَباء,) [but see سِبَآءٌ below,] and مَسْبَأٌ; (S, K;) and ↓ استبأها; (S, M, K;)<br>\
He bought wine, syn. شَرَاهَا, (M, K,) which<br>\
mostly means “ he sold it,” (TA,) or اِشْتَرَاهَا,<br>\
(S, O,) which is well known as meaning “ he<br>\
bought it,” wherefore it is here used in the S and<br>\
O, (TA,) in order that he might drink it: (S,<br>\
O:) accord. to Ks, (TA,) when you buy wine to<br>\
carry it to a place, you say, سَبَيْتُ الخَمْرَ, without<br>\
ء; (S, TA;) and so say the [other] celebrated<br>\
lexicologists, except Fei, accord. to whom you<br>\
say in this case [as in others], سَبَأْتُهَا; and it is<br>\
itself called سَبِيْئَةٌ: (TA:) the verbs are only<br>\
used, in the sense of buying, in relation to wine.<br>\
(S, Msb, TA.) [See also art. سبى.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
سَبَأَ الشَّرَابَ He collected the wine in vessels:<br>\
occurring in this sense in a trad. (Aboo-Moosà,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  سَبَأَتْهُ, (M,) or سَبَأَتِ الجِلْدَ, (K,) said<br>\
of fire, (M, K,) and of whips, (M,) It, or they,<br>\
burned, or hurt, (M, K,) or, as some say, (M,<br>\
but in the K “ and,”) altered, (M, K,) him,<br>\
(M,) or the skin: (K:) and in like manner one<br>\
says of the sun, and of fever, and of journeying.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And سَبَأْتُهُ بِالنَّارِ I burned him with fire:<br>\
(AZ, S:) or سَبَأَ جِلْدَهُ, inf. n. سَبْءٌ, He burned<br>\
his skin; or, as some say, stripped it off: (M:)<br>\
or سَبَأَ الجِلْدَ he burned the skin: and سَبَأَ signifies<br>\
also he stripped off [skin], or he skinned. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And سَبَأْتُ الرَّجُلَ, (inf. n. سَبْءٌ, TA,) I<br>\
flogged the man. (S, K. *)<br>\
-A3-  سَبَأَ عَلَى يَمِينٍ<br>\
كَاذِبَةٍ, (S, M,) aor.<br>\
سَبَاَ, inf. n. سَبْءٌ, (M,) He<br>\
passed over a false oath [that he had sworn], not<br>\
caring for it: (S): or he swore a false oath: and<br>\
some say, سَبَأَ عَلَى يَمِينٍ, aor. and inf. n. as<br>\
above, meaning he passed over an oath [that he<br>\
had sworn], lying. (M.)<br>\
-A4-  سَبَأَ is also syn. with<br>\
صَافَحَ [He took by the hand: &amp;c.]: (O, K:)<br>\
deemed by MF a strange meaning. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسبأ He (a man) was, or became, silent.<br>\
(Sh, TA in art. رطم.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اسبأ لِأَمْرِ اللّٰهِ He,<br>\
(M, K,) or his heart, (L,) was, or became, submissive to the decree of God. (M, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And اسبأ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ His heart became in a bad<br>\
state, or heavy, (خَبُثَ, [so in the M and in a copy<br>\
of the K, in the CK and TA خَبَتَ, and thus in<br>\
my MS. copy of the K, but there altered from<br>\
خَبُثَ, app. on the authority of the TA, and I<br>\
think it a mistranscription, although expl. in the<br>\
TA as meaning اِنْخَضَعَ, which is a signification<br>\
of أَخْبَتَ, the explanation of اسبأ in the next preceding sentence,]) at the thing. (M, K.)<br>\
7<br>\
انسبأ It (the skin) was, or became, stripped.<br>\
off. (S, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And It (a person&#39;s skin) peeled<br>\
off, or became abraded. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِسْتَبَاَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
سَبَأٌ: see سَبِيْئَةٌ<br>\
-A2-  تَفَرَّقُوا أَيْدِى سَبَا, and أَيَادِى<br>\
سَبَا, (M, K,) and with ذَهَبُوا in the place of تفرّقوا,<br>\
(T, TA,) They became scattered, or dispersed,<br>\
(K, TA,) and they went away in a state of dispersion, in the ways of Seba, (T, TA,) a people<br>\
of El-Yemen, who were dispersed in consequence<br>\
of the inundation of their lands by the bursting<br>\
of their [famous] dam, (TA,) and who became<br>\
proverbial on that account: (M, K, TA:) سَبَا is<br>\
here made indecl., (M, K, TA, [بَنُوهُ in the CK<br>\
being a mistranscription for بَنَوْهُ, wherefore كما<br>\
تَبَدَّد has been there interpolated, immediately<br>\
before بَنُوهُ,]) with the last letter quiescent, and<br>\
forms, with the preceding word, a compound like<br>\
خَمْسَةَ عَشَرَ [which implies that we should read<br>\
أَيْدِى سَبَا and أَيَادِىَسَبَا, but I have never found<br>\
it thus written]: (TA:) it is not formed from<br>\
سَبَأَ by suppression of the ء, but is a substitute for<br>\
that word, (M, K, TA,) on account of the frequent use of this phrase. (M, TA.) [See also<br>\
art. سبى.]<br>\
سُبْأَةٌ A long, or far, journey, (IAar, T, M, K,)<br>\
that alters one: (IAar, M, TA:) so termed because the sun alters him who makes a long<br>\
journey. (T, TA. [See 1.]) You say, إِنَّكَ لَتُرِيدُ<br>\
سُبْأَةً Verily thou desirest a long journey, (IAar,<br>\
M, K, *) that will alter thee. (IAar, M.) In the<br>\
case of a short journey, you say, تُرِيدُ سُرْبَةً.<br>\
(T, TA.)<br>\
السَّبَئِيَّةُ, (S, and so in a copy of the K,) or<br>\
↓ السَّبَائِيَّةُ; (so in another copy of the K and<br>\
accord. to the CK;) MF says that the former is<br>\
the correct term, but both are correct; (TA;)<br>\
Certain of the غُلَاة, (S, K, TA,) i. e. extravagant<br>\
zealots of the class of innovators; a party of the<br>\
غُلَاة of the شِيعَة [q. v.]; who are divided into<br>\
eighteen sects: (TA:) they are so called in relation to Seba (سَبَأ) the father of &#39;Abd-Allah, (K,)<br>\
or in relation to &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Seba. (S.)<br>\
سِبَآءٌ [The purchase of wine;] a subst. from<br>\
سَبَأَ الخَمْرَ; (S;) or an inf. n. (M, K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also سَبِيْئَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
سَبِىْءٌ The skin, or slough, of a serpent; (K;)<br>\
as also سَبِىٌّ; for it is with, and without, ء.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
سَبِيْئَةٌ (S, M, K) and ↓ سِبَآءٌ (M, K) and, accord.<br>\
to Ks, ↓ سَبَأْ, but the form commonly known is<br>\
↓ سِبَآءٌ, with kesr to the س, and with medd, (IAmb,<br>\
TA,) Wine, (S, M, K,) in an absolute sense;<br>\
(TA;) or, [as is perhaps meant in the S,] wine<br>\
that is bought to be drunk, not for merchandise.<br>\
(Har p. 409, in explanation of the first word.)<br>\
[See an ex. of the second in a verse of Lebeed<br>\
cited in art. دكن: and see also سَبِيَّةٌ, in art. سبى.]<br>\
السَّبَائِيَّةُ: see السَّبَئِيَّةُ, above.<br>\
سَبَّآءٌ A vintner, or seller of wine. (S, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[It is said in a marginal note in my MS. copy of<br>\
the K that it signifies also A seller of graveclothes: but this is evidently a mistake, app.<br>\
occasioned by a mistranscription, for سَيَّآء, with ى.]<br>\
مَسْبَأٌ A road (S, K) in a mountain. (S.)<br>\
