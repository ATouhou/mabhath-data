سَدَلَهُ, aor.<br>\
سَدُلَ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) and<br>\
سَدِلَ,<br>\
(M, K,) inf. n. سَدْلٌ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb,) He let<br>\
it loose, let it down, lowered it, or let it fall; (S,<br>\
M, K;) namely, his garment, (S, M,) and hair,<br>\
(Fr, M, K,) and a veil, or curtain; (M;) and<br>\
سَدَنَهُ signifies the same; (Fr, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ اسدلهُ; (M, K;) or this latter is a mistake;<br>\
(Mgh; [but this the author asserts because, he<br>\
says, he had searched through books without<br>\
finding it except in the “ Nahj-el-Balághah; ”])<br>\
not allowable; (Msb;) and the former signifies<br>\
he let it down, or let it fall, namely, the garment,<br>\
without drawing together its two sides: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) or, as some say, he threw it upon his head,<br>\
and let it loose, let it down, or let it fall, upon his<br>\
shoulders: (Mgh:) and he let it down, or let it<br>\
fall, namely, hair, not مَعْقُوف [i. e. made recurvate at the extremities], nor tied in knots: (Lth,<br>\
TA:) and one says also, يَزْدُلُ ثَوْبَهُ, changing the<br>\
س into ز. (Sb, M.) The سَدْل that is forbidden<br>\
in prayer is The letting down one&#39;s garment without drawing together its two sides: or the enveloping oneself with his garment, and putting his arms<br>\
within, and bowing the head and body, and prostrating oneself, in that state; as the Jews used<br>\
to do; and this applies uniformly to the shirt and<br>\
other garments: or the putting the middle of the<br>\
إِزَار [or waist-wrapper] upon the head, and letting<br>\
fall its two ends upon one&#39;s right and left, without making it to be upon his two shoulder-blades.<br>\
(TA.) سَدَلَ عِمَامَتَهُ بَيْنَ كَتِفَيْهِ is said in a trad.<br>\
[as meaning He made the end of his turban to<br>\
hang down between his two shoulder-blades].<br>\
(Mgh.) And one says also, شَعَرَهُ عَلَى ↓ سدّل<br>\
عَاتِقَيْهِ وَعُنُقِهِ, [meaning He let his hair fall down<br>\
abundant and long upon his shoulders and his<br>\
neck,] inf. n. تَسْدِيلٌ. (ISh, TA. [See its pass.<br>\
part. n., voce مُنْسَدِلٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, aor.<br>\
سَدِلَ, (M, K,)<br>\
inf. n. as above, (TA,) He slit it, or rent it;<br>\
namely, his garment. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And سَدَلَ فِى<br>\
البِلَادِ, (O, K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) He went<br>\
away into the countries, or provinces. (O, K.)<br>\

انسدل [and accord. to Freytag ↓ تسدّل also,<br>\
but he names no authority for this, and I have not<br>\
found it in any MS. lexicon, but it is agreeable<br>\
with analogy as quasi-pass. of 2,] It was let<br>\
loose, let down, lowered, or let fall; said of hair<br>\
[&amp;c.]. (MA, KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And انسدل يَعُدُو He was<br>\
somewhat quick, or made some haste, running;<br>\
like انسدر; the ر and ل being app. interchangeable. (Har p. 576.)<br>\
Q. Q. 1<br>\

سُدْلٌ and ↓ سِدْلٌ [the former written in a copy<br>\
of the M سَدْل, but said in the K to be with<br>\
damm,] A veil, or curtain: pl. [of mult.] سُدُولٌ<br>\
and [of pauc.] أَسْدَالٌ (M, K) and أَسْدُلٌ. (K.)<br>\
In a verse of Homeyd Ibn-Thowr, as it is related<br>\
by Yaakoob, السُّدُول is used as a sing., because<br>\
it is of a measure which is [in some instances]<br>\
that of a sing., such as السُّدُوس, meaning a sort<br>\
of garment: but others relate it differently, saying<br>\
السَّدِيل, which is correctly a sing. (M.) [See<br>\
also سِدْنٌ.]<br>\
سِدْلٌ A string of gems or jewels: (S:) or a<br>\
string of pearls or large pearls, reaching to the<br>\
breast: (M, K:) pl. سُدُولٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also سُدْلٌ.<br>\
سَدَلٌ An inclining. (M, K.) [See أَسْدَلُ.]<br>\
سِدِلَّى, of the measure فِعِلَّى, an arabicized<br>\
word, originally, in Pers., سِهْ دِلَهْ [“ three-hearted ”],<br>\
as though it were three chambers in one chamber<br>\
(كَأَنَّهُ ثَلاَثَةُ بُيُوتٍ فِى بَيْتٍ), like the حَارِىّ بِكُمَّيْنِ<br>\
[i. e., I suppose, “like the garment of El-Heereh<br>\
with two sleeves; ” app. meaning that it signifies<br>\
An oblong chamber with a wide and deep recess<br>\
on either hand at, or near, one extremity thereof;<br>\
so that its ground-plan resembles an expanded<br>\
garment with a pair of very wide sleeves: in the<br>\
present day, it is commonly applied to a single<br>\
recess of the kind above mentioned, the floor of<br>\
which is elevated about half a foot or somewhat<br>\
more or less above the floor of the main chamber,<br>\
and which has a mattress and cushions laid<br>\
against one or two or each of its three sides].<br>\
(S.) [Golius explains it, as on the authority of<br>\
the S, (in which is nothing relating to it but what<br>\
I have given above,) thus: Pers. سِيدَلَهْ seu<br>\
سِدَرَهْ, i. q. سُدَّرٌ.]<br>\
سَدِيلٌ The thing [or hanging] that is let down,<br>\
or suspended, upon the [kind of camel-vehicle for<br>\
women called] هَوْدَج: (S, O, K:) pl. [of mult.]<br>\
سُدُولٌ and سَدَائِلُ and [of pauc.] أَسْدَالٌ: (S, O:)<br>\
the first of which pls. is expl. by As as meaning<br>\
the pieces of cloth with which the هودج is covered;<br>\
as also سُدُونٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A thing [app. a<br>\
hanging or curtain] that is extended across, or<br>\
sideways, (يُعَرَّضُ,) in the space from side to side<br>\
of the [tent called] خِبَآء (فِى سَعَةِ الخِبَآءِ): and<br>\
(some say, M) the curtain of the حَجَلَة [or bridal<br>\
canopy, &amp;c.,] of a woman: (M, K:) pls. as<br>\
above. (TA.)<br>\
سَنْدَلٌ, or سَمَنْدَلٌ, (accord. to different copies<br>\
of the S,) A certain bird, that eats [the poisonous<br>\
plant called] بِيش [generally applied to the common<br>\
wolf&#39;s-bane, aconitum napellus]: on the authority<br>\
of El-Jáhidh. (S.) [See also art. سمندل.]<br>\
سَوْدَلٌ The mustache. (S, IAar, K.) You say,<br>\
طَالَ سَوْدَلُهُ, (As, K,) or سَوْدَلَاهُ, (IAar,) His mustache, or mustaches, became long. (As, IAar, K.)<br>\
ذَكَرٌ أَسْدَلُ An inclining penis: (M, K:) pl.<br>\
[by rule سُدْلٌ, but it is said to be] سُدُلٌ, i. e. like<br>\
كُتُبٌ. (K.)<br>\
مُسْدَلٌ and مُسَدَّلٌ: see what follows.<br>\
مُنْسَدِلٌ Hair let loose, let down, lowered, or<br>\
let fall: (S:) or lank, or long, and pendent;<br>\
(M, K;) as also ↓ مُسْدَلٌ: (TA:) or abundant<br>\
and long, (Lth, TA,) and so ↓ مُسَدَّلٌ, (ISh, TA,)<br>\
