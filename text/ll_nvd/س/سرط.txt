Msb, K;) and so ↓ تسرّطهُ: (As, K:) and in like<br>\
manner, زَرِدَهُ and ازدردهُ (TA) [and تزرّدهُ]. It is<br>\
said in a prov., لَا تَكُنْ حُلْوًا فَتُسْرَطَ وَلَا مُرًّا فَتُعْقَى<br>\
Be not thou sweet, so that thou shouldest be swallowed; nor bitter, so that thou shouldest be put<br>\
out of the mouth because of thy bitterness: (S,<br>\
TA:) or, accord. to one relation, فَتُعْقِىَ, i. e., so<br>\
that thou shouldest be disliked for being very<br>\
bitter: used in enjoining the taking of a middle<br>\
course of conduct: so in the O. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَسْرَطْتُهُ ذِرَاعِى I put my fore arm upon his<br>\

سِرْطِمٌ and سَرْطَمٌ: see سُرَاطِىٌّ, in three places.<br>\
―<br>\

(Msb;) a certain creeping thing (دَابَّة), of aquatic<br>\
creatures; (M;) a certain fluvial creeping thing<br>\
(دابّة); and also a marine kind, which is an<br>\
animal that becomes hard like stone: the former<br>\
kind is of much utility; the quantity of three<br>\
مَثَاقِيل of its ashes, when burnt in a cooking-pot<br>\
of copper (نُحَاسٍ أَحْمَرَ [for the latter of which<br>\
words we find in the CK خُمِّرَ]), with water or<br>\
wine, or with half its weight of gentian (جِنْطِيَانَا),<br>\
is very good against the bite of the mad dog; if<br>\
its eye be hung upon a person affected with a<br>\
tertian fever, he is cured; and if its leg be hung<br>\
upon a tree, its fruit falls spontaneously: (K:)<br>\
this is [said of] the سرطان that is bred in rivers:<br>\
(TA:) of the marine kind, what is burnt is an<br>\
ingredient in collyriums, (K,) for removing whiteness, (TA,) and in dentifrices (سَنُونَات, so in<br>\

-b2-  السَّرَطَانُ is also<br>\
the name of (assumed tropical:)  A certain sign of the Zodiac; (S,<br>\
M, K;) [Cancer;] the fourth sign; so called<br>\
because resembling the creature above mentioned<br>\
in form. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [The disease called cancer;]<br>\
a black-biliary tumour, which begins like an<br>\
almond, and smaller, and when it becomes large,<br>\
there appear upon it veins, red and green, resembling the legs of the سَرَطَان: there is no hope for<br>\
its cure; and it is treated medicinally only in<br>\
order that it may not increase: (K:) a certain<br>\
disease that attacks men and beasts: (M:)<br>\
it is also (K) a certain disease in the pastern of a<br>\
beast, rendering it hard, or rigid, so that the<br>\
animal inverts his hoof: (S, K:) a certain disease that appears in the legs of beasts: (T, TA:)<br>\

in his fauces, having relation to the blood, and<br>\
resembling the دُبَيْلَة [which is explained by ISh,<br>\
in describing the disease termed ذَاتُ الجَنْبِ, as<br>\
an ulcer that perforates the belly]: and some say,<br>\
that it is [the disease called] دَآءُ الفِيلِ. (TA.)<br>\
سِرْطِيطٌ: see سُرَطْ.<br>\
سُرَطْرِطٌ or سَرَطْرَطٌ: see سُرَطٌ.<br>\
سِرِطْرَاطٌ (Lth, Lh, S, M, K) and سَرَطْرَاطٌ, (Lth,<br>\
M, K,) the former said by Az to be a good form,<br>\
like جِلِبَّابٌ and سِجِلَّاطٌ, but the latter to be the<br>\
only instance of its form known to him, (TA,)<br>\
and ↓ سُرَيْطٌ, like زُبَيْرٌ, (accord. to the K,) or<br>\
↓ سُرَّيْطٌ, (as in the M,) like قُبَّيْطٌ, (TA, [in which<br>\
this is said to be the right form,]) [The kind of<br>\
sweet food called] فَالُوذٌ, [Lh, S, M, K,) or فَالُوذَجٌ;<br>\
(as in some copies of the K and in the TA;) so<br>\
called because very delicious to eat and swallow,<br>\
from سَرَطٌ signifying the “ act of swallowing; ”<br>\
(Az, TA;) of the dial. of Syria: (Lh, M:) or<br>\
[the kind of sweet food called] خَبِيصٌ. (M, K.)<br>\
سُرَاطٌ: see سُرَاطِىٌّ.<br>\
سِرَاطٌ A road, or way: (Msb:) or a conspicuous road or way; (M, K;) so called because<br>\
he who goes away on it disappears like food that<br>\
is swallowed; (K) i. q. صِرَاطٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
which is of the dial. of the early Kureysh, (Fr,)<br>\
and is the more approved, on account of the<br>\
mutual resemblance [of the ص and ط], (M, K,)<br>\
though the former is the original; (M, Msb, K;)<br>\
and زِرَاطٌ; for the saying that the pronunciation<br>\
with the pure ز is a mistake, is [itself] a mistake:<br>\
(K:) [ISd says,] As mentions the reading الزِّرَاط,<br>\
with the pure ز; but this is a mistake; for he<br>\
only heard the resemblance, and imagined it to<br>\
be ز; and As was not a grammarian, that he<br>\
should be trusted in this matter: (M:) this is<br>\
[itself, however,] a mistake; for AA is related to<br>\
have read الزّراط, and the same is related of<br>\
Hamzeh, by Ks. (TA.) One says also, هُوَ فِى<br>\
دِينِهِ عَلَى سِرَاطٍ مُسْتَقِيمٍ (tropical:)  [He is, in respect of his<br>\
religion, on, or in, a right way]. (TA.) [It is<br>\
