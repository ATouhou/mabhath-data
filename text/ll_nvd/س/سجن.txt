سَجُنَ, inf. n. سَجْنٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb,) He imprisoned him. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] it is said in a trad., مَا شَىْءٌ أَحَقَّ بِطُولِ<br>\
السَّجْنِ مِنْ لِسَانٍ (assumed tropical:)  [There is not anything more<br>\
deserving of long restraint than a tongue]. (L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And سَجَنَ الهَمَّ (tropical:)  He secreted anxiety; did not<br>\
reveal it. (L, K.) A poet says,<br>\
وَ لَا تَسْجُنَنَّ الهَمَّ إِنَّ لِسَجْنِهِ<br>\
عَنَآءً وَ حَمِّلْهُ المَهَارَى النَّوَاجِيَا<br>\
(tropical:)  [And by no means secrete thou anxiety: verily<br>\
to the secreting thereof pertains embarrassment:<br>\
but load with it fleet camels of Mahreh]. (L.)<br>\

سجّنهُ, inf. n. تَسْجِينٌ, i. q. شَقَّقَهُ [He cut it,<br>\
or divided it, lengthwise; clave it; split it; &amp;c.].<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And سجّن النَّخْلَ He made the palmtrees to be such as are termed سِلْتِين [or سِجِّين;<br>\
i. e. he dug at their feet trenches to conduct the<br>\
water to them when it did not reach to them]. (K.)<br>\
سِجْنٌ A prison; (S, L, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ سِجِّينٌ: (L:) pl. of the former سُجُونٌ. (Mgh,<br>\
Msb.)<br>\
سَجِينٌ is syn. with ↓ مَسْجُونٌ [Imprisoned];<br>\
pl. سُجَنَآءُ and سَجْنَى: and is applied to a female<br>\
likewise, as also سَجِينَةٌ; pl. سَجْنَى and سَجَائِنُ.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
سَجَّانٌ The keeper of a prison. (K.)<br>\
سِجِّينٌ: see سِجْنٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [In the Kur lxxxiii. 7,]<br>\
A certain place in which is the record [of the<br>\
deeds] of the wicked; (S, L, K;) or, as I &#39;Ab<br>\
says, in which are their registers: AO says, it is<br>\
of the measure فِعِّيلٌ from السِّجْنُ, like الفِسِّيقُ<br>\
from الفِسْقُ: (S, L:) or a certain valley in Hell:<br>\
or a certain stone, [or rock,] (L, K,) beneath,<br>\
(L,) or in, (K,) the seventh earth: (L, K:)<br>\
[these explanations are given by those who hold<br>\
that مَا سِجِّينٌ in the next verse is for مَا كِتَابُ<br>\
سِجِّينٍ:] or it there means a register comprising<br>\
the deeds of the wicked, (Bd, Jel, *) of the jinn,<br>\
or genii, and of mankind, (Bd,) or of the devils<br>\
and the unbelievers: (Jel:) or ما سجّين in the<br>\
next verse is for ما كتاب سجّين, and the meaning is the place, (Bd, Jel,) which is beneath the<br>\
seventh earth, the abode of Iblees and his forces:<br>\
(Jel:) IAth says, it occurs in a trad. with the<br>\
article ال; and without that article it is a proper<br>\
name for the fire [of Hell], and hence the mention of it in the Kur lxxxiii. 7. (L.) [See also<br>\
سِجِّيلٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  Also Anything hard: (L:) and hard,<br>\
vehement, or severe; (S, L, K;) applied to a<br>\
beating. (S, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Continuing, lasting, or<br>\
everlasting; syn. دَائِمٌ; (L, K;) as also سِجِّيلٌ:<br>\
so accord. to El-Muärrij. (L. [See, again,<br>\
سِجِّيلٌ.])<br>\
-A3-  And i. q. عَلَانِيَة: (L, K:) so in the<br>\
saying, عَمِلَ ذٰلِكَ سِجِّينًا [He did that openly,<br>\
or publicly]. (L.)<br>\
-A4-  Also Palm-trees (نَخْل)<br>\
such as are termed سِلْتِين (As, L, K) in the dial.<br>\
of the people of El-Bahreyn; (As, L;) [app.<br>\
meaning that the latter word is of that dial.; for<br>\
it is said that] the Arabs [app. the Arabs in<br>\
general] say سِجِّين in the place of سِلْتِين, which<br>\
is not Arabic: (L:) the palm-trees thus termed<br>\
are such as have trenches dug at their feet to<br>\
conduct the water to them when it has not reached<br>\
to them. (L, and K in art. سلتن.)<br>\
سَاجُونٌ Iron such as is termed أَنِيث [i. e.<br>\
female, meaning soft]. (L.)<br>\
[<br>\
مَسْجَنَةٌ, accord. to Freytag, The act of imprisoning: but it seems rather to be a word of the<br>\
class of مَبْخَلَةٌ and مَجْبَنَةٌ &amp;c., and to signify a<br>\
cause of imprisonment.]<br>\
مَسْجُونٌ: see سَجِينٌ.<br>\
