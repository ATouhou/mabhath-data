سَكْبَجَ He prepared سِكْبَاج. (TA.)<br>\
سِكْبَاجٌ an arabicized word, (O, Msb, K,) with<br>\
kesr (Msb, K) to the س, not with fet-h, because<br>\
there is no word of the measure فَعْلَالٌ except of<br>\
the reduplicate class [like زَلْزَالٌ &amp;c.], (Msb,) from<br>\
سِكْ, meaning “vinegar,” in Pers., and بَاج,<br>\
[arabicized from the Pers. بَاهَا,] i. e. لَوْنٌ [as<br>\
meaning “a sort,” or “species,” of food or<br>\
viands]; (O; [in which it is erroneously said<br>\
that بَاج is in Pers. بَاوَا;]) or from [the Pers.]<br>\
سِرْكَهْ پَاچَهْ; [سِرْكَهْ meaning “vinegar;” and<br>\
پَاچَهْ “sheeps&#39; feet,” or “trotters;”] (TA;) [but<br>\
the former derivation is evidently the more probable;] A well-known kind of food; (Msb;)<br>\
flesh-meat cooked with vinegar: this is the best<br>\
that is said [in explanation of the word]: (TA:)<br>\
[in the present day, applied to a sort of food<br>\
composed of flesh-meat, wheat-flour, and vinegar;<br>\
and sometimes to other varieties of food, but<br>\
vinegar, I believe, enters into the composition of<br>\
them all: also called سِكْبَا; from the Pers. سِكْ<br>\
“vinegar,” and بَا “spoon-meat:” accord. to<br>\
Golius, on the authority of the Loghat NiametAllah Khaleel Soofee, a sort of food composed of flesh-meat cut in pieces, (to which are<br>\
afterwards added raisins, a few figs, and some<br>\
vetches,) with vinegar and honey, or acid syrop:<br>\
and سِكْبَاجُ البَقَرِ is a name given to such food<br>\
prepared with beef:] سِكْبَاجٌ أَصْفَرُ is a well-known<br>\
sort of broth [or soup] in which is saffron, wherefore it is termed اصفر. (Mgh.)<br>\
