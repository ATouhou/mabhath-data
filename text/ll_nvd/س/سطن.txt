He supported upon أَسَاطِين, i. e. columns: ―<br>\

سَاطِنٌ i. q. خَبِيثٌ [Bad, corrupt, &amp;c.; like<br>\
شَاطِنٌ]. (M, L, K.)<br>\
أَسْطَانٌ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned] Vessels of صُفْر [or brass]. (L, K.)<br>\
أُسْطُوَانٌ, an arabicized word, (Az, L,) [app.<br>\
from the Pers. أُسْتُونْ, like the word next following,] A man long in the legs and back. (M,<br>\
L.) And A camel long in the neck, (M, L, K,)<br>\
or (K) high. (S, M, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  What is termed<br>\
أُسْتُوَانُ البَيْتِ is well known [app. meaning The<br>\
pole of the tent: (see what next follows:) and this<br>\
seems to be the primary signification]. (M, L.)<br>\
أُسْطُوَانَةٌ a word of well-known meaning, (S,<br>\
L,) arabicized from [the Pers.] أُسْتُوِنْ [which<br>\
signifies the same], (K,) i. q. سَارِيَةٌ [meaning<br>\
A column, of stone or of baked bricks]: (S, M,<br>\
L, Msb, K:) pl. أَسَاطِينُ (S, M, * L, Msb, K *) and<br>\
أُسْطُوَانَاتٌ: (Msb:) it is of the measure أُفْعُوَالَةٌ,<br>\
(S, L, Msb, K,) because its pl. is أَسَاطَينُ, the ن<br>\
being radical, (L, Msb,) accord. to Kh (Msb)<br>\
and Fr, who says that it is the only instance of<br>\
this measure; (L;) or of the measure فُعْلُوَانَةٌ,<br>\
(S, L, K,) accord. to Akh, but, (J says, L,) if so,<br>\
the و is augmentative and has next to it two<br>\
augmentative letters, and this is scarcely ever, or<br>\
never, the case; (S, L;) IB, however, says that<br>\
this is the true measure, as is shown by its pl.,<br>\
أَسَاطِينُ, and its dim., ↓ أُسَيْطِينَةٌ: (L:) accord. to<br>\
some, it is of the measure أُفْعُلَانَةٌ, (S, L, Msb,)<br>\
but, if it were so, it would not have for its pl.<br>\
أَسَاطِينُ, as there is no instance of the measure<br>\
أَفَاعِينُ. (S, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also A portico. Hence,<br>\
أَهْلُ الأُسْطُوَانَةِ The Stoics. ―<br>\
-b3-  And A cylinder.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And The legs of a beast: (K:) [or rather the<br>\
pl.] أَسَاطِينُ has this meaning. (L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And The<br>\
penis. (K.)<br>\
