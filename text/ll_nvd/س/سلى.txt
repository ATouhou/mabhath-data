سَلًى or سَلًا [thus differently written, the former<br>\
the more correct, unless the word be derived from<br>\
السَّلْوَةُ, as it is said to be in the Ham p. 656, but<br>\
this is improbable,] The secundine; i. e. the skin,<br>\

off from the face of the young camel at the time<br>\
of the birth, or else it kills it, like as it does when<br>\
it becomes disrupted in the belly: when it comes<br>\
forth, the she-camel is safe, and so is the young<br>\

perishes, and so does the young one: (S:) pl.<br>\

[The knife reached to the bone]. (S, K.) And<br>\
هُوَ آكِلُ الأَسْلَآءِ (assumed tropical:)  [He is the eater of secundines];<br>\
meaning he is low, base, vile, or sordid. (TA.)<br>\
And وَقَعَ القَوْمُ فِى سَلَى جَمَلٍ (assumed tropical:)  [The people, or<br>\
party, fell into the like of the secundine of a hecamel]; meaning they fell into a difficult affair<br>\
or case; (S, K *) or they fell into an unparalleled<br>\
evil; (Meyd;) for the he-camel has no سلى. (S,<br>\
Meyd.)<br>\
