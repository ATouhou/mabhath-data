سَبَكَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
سَبِكَ, (S, K,) so<br>\
says El-Fárábee, and so in the Jm, and in the<br>\
handwriting of Aboo-Sahl El-Harawee, (TA,)<br>\
or<br>\
سَبُكَ, (Msb,) thus in the handwriting of Az,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. سَبْكٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) He melted,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,) and cleared of its dross,<br>\
(Mgh,) and poured forth (K, TA) into a mould,<br>\
(TA,) gold, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) or silver, (S,<br>\
Mgh, TA,) &amp;c.; (S, TA;) and ↓ سبّك signifies<br>\
the same, (K,) inf. n. تَسْبِيكٌ; (TA;) this inf. n.<br>\
and سَبْكٌ both signifying the melting of gold and<br>\
silver, and pouring it forth into a مِسْبَكَة [or<br>\
mould] of iron, like the half of a cane divided<br>\
lengthwise. (Lth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, سَبْكٌ is metaphorically used in the sense of تَجْرِبَةٌ. (Har pp.<br>\
140 and 211.) One says, فُلَانٌ سَبَكَتْهُ التَّجَارِبُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Such a one, tryings tried, or have tried, him].<br>\
(TA.) And كَلَامٌ لَا يَثْبُتُ عَلَى السَّبْكِ is another<br>\
tropical phrase [app. meaning (tropical:)  Speech or language, that does not stand good, or is not sound,<br>\
or valid, when tried, or tested; that will not stand<br>\
trying, or testing]. (TA.)<br>\

سَبِيكَةٌ [a subst. formed from the epithet سَبِيكٌ<br>\
by the affix ة, An ingot, i. e.] a piece (Lth, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K) of gold, (Lth, Mgh, Msb, TA,) or of<br>\

(Mgh,) and poured forth (K, TA) into a mould,<br>\
(TA,) [i. e.,] into a مِسْبَكَة of iron like the half<br>\
of a cane divided lengthwise: (Lth, TA:) pl.<br>\
سَبَائِكُ. (Lth, S, Msb.) An Arab of the desert<br>\
likened to it a difficult mountain that he desired<br>\
to ascend, because of its smoothness; saying,<br>\
أَىُّ سَبِيكَةٍ هٰذِهِ [What an ingot is this !]. (A,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The pl. is also applied to وُقَاق [i. e.<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Thin, flat, bread]; this being so called because<br>\
it is made of choice, or pure, flour; and is as<br>\
though it were prepared therefrom by being<br>\
melted and poured into a mould (كَأَنَّهُ سُبِكَ مِنْهَ),<br>\
and cleared from the bran. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
سَبَّاكٌ A melter and purifier and caster, or<br>\
one who makes سَبَائِك, of gold, or silver, or the<br>\
like. ―<br>\

[app. meaning (tropical:)  He is a trier, or tester, or a<br>\
purifier, of speech, or language: see 1]. (TA.)<br>\

مِسْبَكَةٌ A mould of iron like the half of a cane<br>\
divided lengthwise, into which molten gold and<br>\
silver (Lth, TA) and the like (TA) are poured:<br>\
