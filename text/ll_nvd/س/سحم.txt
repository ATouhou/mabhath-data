or it, was, or became, black. (Msb.)<br>\
2<br>\
سَحَّمُوا وَجْهَهُ They blackened his face; syn.<br>\
حَيَّيُوهُ; as also سَخَّمُوهُ. (A, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسحمت السَّمَآءُ The sky poured forth its<br>\
water: (K:) mentioned as on the authority of<br>\
IAar: but it has been mentioned before, on his<br>\
authority, as with ج. (TA.)<br>\
سَحَمٌ: see سُحْمَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  A sort of tree; (S, K;)<br>\
like ↓ سَحْمَآءُ: (S:) the latter also signifies a sort<br>\
of tree: (K:) the former is said by ISk to be a<br>\
certain plant: and by AHn, to be a plant that<br>\
grows like the نَصِىّ and صِلِّيَان and عَنْكَث, except<br>\
that it is taller; the سَحَمَة [i. e. the single plant<br>\
of this species] being sometimes as tall as a man,<br>\
and larger. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also Iron: (IAar, K:)<br>\

The blacksmith&#39;s hammers. (IAar, K.)<br>\
سُحْمَةٌ Blackness; (S, Msb, K;) as also ↓ سَحَمٌ,<br>\
[mentioned above as inf. n. of سَحِمَ,] and ↓ سُحَامٌ;<br>\
(K;) like [سُخْمَةٌ and] سَخَمٌ: (TA in art. سخم:)<br>\
a blackness like the colour of the crow to which<br>\
the epithet ↓ أَسْحَمُ is applied. (Lth, TA.)<br>\
سُحَامٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
سُحَيْمٌ: see the next following paragraph.<br>\
أَسْحَمُ Black; (S, Msb, K;) like أَسْخَمُ; (TA<br>\
in art. سخم;) applied to the crow; see سُحْمَةٌ:<br>\
(Lth, TA:) fem. سَحْمَآءُ; (Msb, TA;) applied to<br>\
a plant of that colour; (ISk, TA;) and particularly to the نَصِىّ when it is of that colour, and<br>\
thus applied as an intensive epithet; and to a<br>\
woman in the same sense: (TA:) and ↓ إِسْحِمَانٌ<br>\
signifies anything black (ISd, K) accord. to some;<br>\
but this is a mistake, for it is only أَسْحَمُ. (ISd,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] الأَسْحَمُ is the name of A certain idol, (K, TA,) which was black. (TA.) ―<br>\

black cloud. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also Blood into which<br>\
are dipped the hands of persons swearing, one to<br>\
another; (K;) or blood into which the hand is<br>\
dipped on the occasion of swearing with another<br>\
or others: said to have this meaning in the saying<br>\
of El-Aashà,<br>\
رَضِيعَىْ لِبَانِ ثَدْىِ أُمٍّ تَحَالَفَا<br>\
بِأَسْحَمَ دَاجٍ عَوْضُ لَا تَتَفَرَّقُ<br>\
[Two foster-brothers by the sucking of the breast<br>\
of one mother swore together, by dark blood into<br>\
which they dipped their hands, that you, or they,<br>\
i. e. a tribe (قَبِيلَة) or a company of men (جَمَاعَة),<br>\
for, without the context, the meaning is doubtful,<br>\
should not ever become separated]: or it has here<br>\
one, or another, of three meanings here following. (S.) ―<br>\
-b6-  The womb. (S.) ―<br>\
-b7-  The nipple of a<br>\
woman&#39;s breast: (K:) or the blackness of the<br>\
nipple of a woman&#39;s breast. (S.) ―<br>\
-b8-  A skin such<br>\
as is termed زِقّ for wine: (S, K:) because of<br>\
its blackness: and ↓ سُحَيْمٌ also signifies a زِقّ<br>\

-b9-  Also A horn: (S, K:) thus in the saying of Zuheyr,<br>\
وَتَذَبِيبُهَا عَنْهُ بِأَسْحَمَ مِذْوَدِ<br>\
[And the frequent repelling of her, or them, from<br>\
him with a horn; so that مذود is merely an explicative adjunct, for it also means a horn, or it<br>\
may be rendered here an instrument for repel-ling]: (S, * TA:) or [اسحم is here an epithet,<br>\
and] the meaning is, with a black horn. (TA.)<br>\
Another poet uses the phrase تَذُبُّ بِسَحْمَاوَيْنِ.<br>\
[so in the TA, app. a mistranscription for تَذُبُّ,]<br>\
i. e., [reading تَذُبُّ, She repels] with a pair of<br>\
horns; using the fem, as meaning بِصِيصيَتَيْنِ;<br>\
as though he said بِصِيصِيتَيْنِ سَحْمَاوَيْنِ [with two<br>\
black horns]. (IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  The fem., السَّحْمَآءُ<br>\
also signifies The دُبُر [here meaning anus]: (K:)<br>\
because of its colour. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  For another signification of the fem., see سَحَمٌ.<br>\
أُسْحُمَانٌ Of the colour termed أُدْمَةٌ [here app.<br>\
meaning tawniness] in an intense degree. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also A sort of tree. (M, K.) A poet uses<br>\
the phrase الأُسْحُمَانُ الأَسْحَمُ [The black, or dark,<br>\
اسحمان]. (M, TA.)<br>\
إِسْحِمَانٌ: see أَسْحَمُ, first sentence.<br>\
