سَهَا عَنْهُ, (S, Msb,) or فِيهِ, (K,) aor. يَسْهُو,<br>\
inf. n. سَهْوٌ (S, Msb, K) and سُهُوٌّ, (M, K,) He<br>\
was, or became, unmindful, forgetful, neglectful,<br>\
or heedless, of it, or inadvertent to it; (S, Msb;)<br>\
namely, a thing; syn. غَفَلَ عَنْهُ: (S, * Msb:) or<br>\
he forgot it, or neglected it, (نَسِيَهُ,) and was, or<br>\
became, unmindful, forgetful, &amp;c., of it, or inadvertent to it, (غَفَلَ عَنْهُ,) his mind adverting to<br>\
another thing or affair or case; (K, TA;) thus<br>\
expl. in the M and T; so that السَّهْوُ and الغَفْلَةُ<br>\
and النِّسْيَانُ are made to be one [in signification];<br>\
(TA;) but accord. to Esh-Shiháb, السَّهْوُ is a<br>\
slight غَفْلَة [or unmindfulness &amp;c.] of that which<br>\
is within the scope of the retentive faculty, such<br>\
as when one&#39;s attention is roused by the least<br>\
rousing thereof; whereas النسيان denotes its<br>\
passing away from the memory entirely; though<br>\
all are used in one sense by a careless reliance<br>\
upon the understanding of the reader or hearer:<br>\
in the Msb it is said that a distinction is made<br>\
between السَّاهِى and النَّاسِى by the latter&#39;s being<br>\
applied to him who, when he is reminded, remembers, and the former&#39;s being applied to him<br>\
who is in the contrary case: accord. to IAth,<br>\
سَهَافِى الشَّىْءِ means he neglected, or omitted, the<br>\
thing unknowingly; and سَهَا عَنْهُ, he neglected, or<br>\
omitted, it knowingly: or, as some say, السَّهْوُ is<br>\
the doing wrong from unmindfulness (عَنْ غَفْلَة);<br>\
as when an insane person reviles another, which<br>\
is pardonable; and as when one drinks wine and<br>\
then some unpleasing action proceeds from him<br>\
unintentionally, which is punishable. (TA.) One<br>\
says, سَهَافِى الصَّلَاةِ, and عَنْهَا, i. q. غَفَلَ [He was,<br>\
or became, unmindful in prayer, and of it].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app., as implying an unexpected event,] حَمَلَتْ سَهْوًا She (a woman, S)<br>\
conceived in menstruis. (Az, S, Z, K.) And حَمَلَتْ<br>\
بِهِ أُمُّهُ سَهْوًا His mother conceived him in menstruis. (JK.) ―<br>\
-b3-  السَّهْوُ also signifies السُّكُونُ (JK,<br>\
S, K) and اللِّينُ (JK, S,) [app. as an inf. n., i. e.<br>\
as meaning The being still, or quiet, and gentle;<br>\
though it is immediately added in the S that the<br>\
pl. is سِهَآءٌ; for it seems that an early transcriber<br>\
of the S has omitted to insert after اللَّينُ the<br>\
words وَالسَّاكِنُ وَاللَّيِّنُ: see سَهْوٌ below]. One<br>\
says, فَعَلَهُ سَهْوًا رَهْوًا He did it voluntarily, without<br>\
its being asked, or demanded; (K, TA;) and<br>\
without constraint: (TA:) or quietly, or calmly,<br>\
without being hard, or difficult. (TA in art. رهو.)<br>\
And سَهَا إِلَيْهِ He looked at him, or it, with<br>\
motionless eye. (Msb, TA.) And العَيْنُ تَسْهُو فِيهِ<br>\
The eye expatiates in it; syn. تَنْبَسِطُ. (JK.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
سَهَاوَةٌ, as denoting a quality of a camel, The being<br>\
easy to ride; (K;) an inf. n., of which the verb<br>\
is سَهُوَ. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  مَالٌ لَا يُسْهَى وَلَا يُنْهَى [Cattle]<br>\
of which the end is not to be reached. (AA, JK,<br>\
S, K.) You say, يَرَاحُ عَلَى بَنِى فُلَانٍ مِنَ المَالِ مَا<br>\
لَا يُسْهَىوَلَا يُنْهَى [There returns from the place<br>\
of pasture in the evening, or afternoon, to the<br>\
sons of such a one, of cattle,] what is not to be<br>\
numbered for multitude: (T, TA:) or what is<br>\
not to be computed, or computed by conjecture.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) And ذَهَبَتْ تَمِيمُ فَلَا تُسْهَى وَلَا تُنْهَى,<br>\
meaning لَا تُذْكَرُ [i. e. Temeem went away, and<br>\
will not be remembered, or will not be mentioned]:<br>\
a saying of El-Ahmar. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
ساهاهُ, inf. n. مُسَاهَاةٌ, i. q. غَافَلَهُ [app. meaning He acted with him in the manner of him who<br>\
is unmindful, forgetful, neglectful, heedless, or<br>\
inadvertent]. (TA.) [Or] the inf. n. signifies<br>\
[The acting with moderation with another; or]<br>\
the abstaining from going to the utmost length in<br>\
social intercourse: (S, K:) or the being easy, or<br>\
facile, with another: (A, TA:) or the behaving<br>\
in a good [or pleasing] manner in social intercourse: (T, TA:) or the comporting oneself with<br>\
another, or others, (مُخَالَقَةٌ,) in a good manner,<br>\
in social intercourse. (&#39;Eyn, M, TA.) And one<br>\
says, هُوَ يُسَاهِى أَصْحَابَهُ He comports himself with<br>\
his companions, or does so with good nature; syn.<br>\
يُخَالِقُهُمْ. (TA.) And ساهاهُ means also He<br>\
mocked at him, or derided him. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسهى He (a man, TA) constructed what is<br>\
termed a سَهْوَة (K, TA) in a بَيْت [or chamber<br>\
&amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
السُّهَا [often written السُّهَى] A certain dim star,<br>\
(S, K,) in [the asterism called] بَنَات نَعْش الكُبْرَى,<br>\
(S, [in the K, erroneously, بنات نعش الصُّغْرَى,])<br>\
by the middle star of those thus called; (TA;)<br>\
[i. e.] a small star by that called العَنَاقُ, (which<br>\
latter is the middle star [<br>\
ζ] of the three in the tail of<br>\
Ursa Major, Kzw,) by looking at which persons<br>\
try their powers of sight; (Kzw, TA;) mentioned<br>\

star 80, by<br>\
ζ;] also called ↓ السُّهَيَّا, which is the<br>\
diminutive. (TA.) It is said in a prov., أُرِيهَا<br>\
السُّهَا وَتُرِينِى القَمَرَ [I show her Es-Suhà and she<br>\
shows me the moon]. (S, TA. [See also Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Prov. vol. i. pp. 527—9.]) And one says,<br>\
أَنَّى يَلْتَقِى سُهَيْلٌ وَالسُّهَا How can Suheyl [or<br>\
Canopus] meet Es-Suhà? for the former is<br>\
southern and the latter is northern. (Har p. 276.)<br>\
سَهْوٌ [an inf. n. used as an epithet,] Easy; applied to a man, and to an affair, (K, TA,) and to<br>\
an object of want: (TA:) and so [the fem.]<br>\
سَهْوَةٌ, applied to a mare; and applied to a she-mule as meaning easy in pace, that does not<br>\
fatigue her rider: the epithet سَهْوٌ, however, is<br>\
not applied to a he-mule: so in the T: (TA:)<br>\
[but] it is applied to a he-camel, meaning easy to<br>\
ride: and سَهْوَةٌ to a she-camel, (K, TA,) meaning<br>\
gentle, easy to ride: and رَاهٍ ↓ سَاهٍ, applied to<br>\
a he-camel, means [likewise] gentle in pace; and<br>\
so [the pls.] سَوَاهٍ رَوَاهٍ applied to camels: (TA:)<br>\
[and so ↓ سَهْوَآءُ applied to a mare; for] a certain<br>\
mare was named السَّهْوَآءُ because of the gentleness<br>\
of her pace. (TA.) Also, applied to water, Cool,<br>\
sweet, or limpid; easy of descent in the throat.<br>\
(K, * TA.) And قَوْسٌ سَهْوَةٌ A bow that is compliant, (K, TA,) and easy. (TA.) And رِيحٌ سَهْوٌ<br>\

وَكَانَتْ قَبْلَ مَهْلِكِهِ سِهَآءَا<br>\
i. e. [The winds blew violently for the loss of<br>\
&#39;Amr; but they were before his death] quiet and<br>\
gentle. (S, TA.) One says also أَرْضٌ سَهْوَةٌ Soft<br>\

of roofed vestibule, or the like, or a covering for<br>\

or in the front of, houses: (As, JK, S:) or [in<br>\
some copies of the K “ and ”] a kind of closet<br>\

the waterers of the camels shelter themselves: or,<br>\

roof being placed over the whole; what is in the<br>\
middle [or main part] of the chamber being [called]<br>\
a سَهْوَة; [see عَرْسٌ;] and what is within it, [app.<br>\

signifies also, (JK,) four sticks, or pieces of wood,<br>\

which means a small closet or store-room: (TA:)<br>\
and i. q. رَوْشَنٌ and كُوَّةٌ [i. e. a window, or mural<br>\

or screen, before the court, or yard, of a house,<br>\
(K, TA,) and sometimes, surrounding the house,<br>\
like a wall: (TA:) its pl. (in all of these senses,<br>\
K, TA) is سِهَآءٌ (JK, K, TA) and سَهَوَاتٌ. (JK.)<br>\
سَهْوَآءُ: see سَهْوٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and see also what here follows.<br>\
سِهْوَآءٌ, (IAar, JK, S, TA,) like سِعْوَآءٌ and تِهْوَآءٌ,<br>\
all with kesr, on the authority of IAar, but in the<br>\
K ↓ سَهْوَآء, (TA,) A [portion, or short portion,<br>\
such as is termed] سَاعَة, of the night; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
and (S, TA) the first part thereof: (JK, S, TA:)<br>\
or it may be like ↓ سَهْوَان, [which is app. in this<br>\
case with tenween, and] which seems to mean a<br>\
period in which people are unmindful of the<br>\
places, or ways, in which things are, or should be,<br>\
sought by them; or سهوان may be from سَاهِيَةٌ,<br>\
expl. below: and مِنَ اللَّيْلِ ↓ سِهْوٌ signifies the<br>\
same as سِعْو and سَعْو [and سِهْوَآء] and سِعْوَاء.<br>\
(Ham p. 708.) One says, لَقِيتُهُ بَعْدَ سِهْوَآءٍ مِنَ<br>\
اللَّيْلِ i. e. [I met him after a portion, or short<br>\
portion, of the night; or] after the first part of<br>\

(S) i. e. Only the unmindful [lit. the sons of the<br>\
unmindful] are such as require to be enjoined:<br>\
(S, Meyd:) or, as some say, by بنو سهوان are<br>\
meant all mankind; because all become unmindful: but the most correct explanation is, that those<br>\
who are enjoined to do a thing are subject to unmindfulness: it is applied to him who is unmindful of pursuing that which he is commanded to<br>\
do: and سهوان may be syn. with [the inf. n.]<br>\
سَهْوٌ; or it may be an epithet, syn. with سَاهٍ, and<br>\
is applied to Adam, because he forgot his cove-<br>\
nant, so that بنو سهوان may mean the sons of<br>\
Adam, and hence, the unmindful. (Meyd. [See<br>\
also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 3-4.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
سَهوٌ.<br>\
سَاهِيَةٌ A tract of land long and wide, without<br>\
any covert of trees, or the like, [to obstruct the<br>\

Colours; but also meaning sorts, or species; and<br>\

M: (TA:) or it signifies, (JK,) or signifies also,<br>\
(TA,) various sorts (ضُرُوبٌ مُخْتَلِفةٌ, JK, TA)<br>\
of pace of camels; like أَسَاهِيجُ: (TA:) and its<br>\
sing. is ↓ أَسْهَآءَةٌ. (JK.)<br>\
