سانههُ, inf. n. مُسَانَهَةٌ and سِنَاهٌ; and سَاناهُ,<br>\
inf. n. مُسَانَاةٌ; (K;) or عَامَلَهُ مُسُانَهَةً, and مُسَانَاةً;<br>\
(Msb;) He made an engagement, or a contract,<br>\
with him for work or the like, by the year: (K:)<br>\
and اِسْتَأْجَرْتُهُ مُسَانَهَةً, and مُسَانَاةً, [I hired him by<br>\
the year:] (S:) مُسَانَهَةٌ and مُسَانَاةٌ from السَّنَةُ are<br>\
like مُعَاوَمَةٌ from العَامُ, and مُشَاهَرَةٌ from الشَّهْرُ, and<br>\
مُرَابَعَةٌ from الرَّبِيعُ, &amp;c. (TA in art. ربع.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
سانهت النَّخْلَةُ The palm-tree bore one year and<br>\
not another; (As, K;) as also عَاوَمَت. (As, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَسْنَهَ In this form of the verb, the final radical<br>\
letter is changed into ت, so that they say أَسْنَتُوا,<br>\
meaning They experienced drought, or barrenness. (TA. [See also art. سنت.])<br>\
5<br>\
تَسَنَّهْتُ عِنْدَهُ, (S,) and تَسَنَّيْتُ عنده, (S, Msb,)<br>\
I remained, stayed, dwelt, or abode, with him, or<br>\
at his abode, a year: (Msb:) both signify the<br>\
same. (TA.) [See also 5 in art. سنو and سنى.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  تسنّهت النَّخْلَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The palm-tree underwent the<br>\
lapse of years; (S, Msb;) as also ↓ سَنِهَت: (S:)<br>\
and in like manner one says of other things.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  تسنّه said of food and of beverage,<br>\
(Fr, S, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  It became altered [for the worse];<br>\
as also ↓ سَنِهَ, aor.<br>\
سَنَهَ, inf. n. سَنَهٌ: (TA:) or it<br>\
became altered [for the worse] by the lapse of<br>\
years: (Fr, S, TA:) and التَّسَنُّهُ in relation to<br>\
bread and beverage &amp;c. means the becoming<br>\
mouldy, or musty, or spoiled. (S: and so in some<br>\
copies of the K and in the TA: in other copies of<br>\
the K, السَّنِهُ, like كَتِف, is put in the place of<br>\
التَّسَنُّهُ; and المُتَكَرِّجُ in the place of the explanation التَّكَرُّجُ.) فَانْظُرْ إِلَى طَعَامِكَ وَشَرَابِكَ لَمْ يَتَسَنَّهْ,<br>\
in the Kur [ii. 261], means (assumed tropical:)  [But look at thy<br>\
food and thy beverage,] it has not become altered<br>\
[for the worse] by the lapse of years: (Fr, S,<br>\
TA:) Az says that this is the right way of reading, by pronouncing the ه in يتسنّه in pausing<br>\
after it and in continuing without pausing: Ks<br>\
used to suppress the ه in the latter case and to<br>\
pronounce it in the former: and Aboo-&#39;Amr EshSheybánee says that the original form [of يَتَسَنَّ]<br>\
is يَتَسَنَّنْ; the like change being made in it as is<br>\
made in تَظَنَّيْتُ [for تَظَنَّنْتُ] and in قَصَّيَتُ أَظْفَارِى<br>\
[for قَصَّصْتُ اظفارى]. (TA. [See also 5 in art.<br>\
سنو and سنى, last sentence.])<br>\
سَنَةٌ a word of which the final radical letter is<br>\
rejected, (S, Msb,) and of which there are two dial.<br>\
vars., (Msb,) being, accord. to some, originally<br>\
سَنْهَةٌ, (S, Msb,) like جَبْهَةٌ (S) or سَجْدَةٌ, (Msb,) and<br>\
accord to others, سَنْوةٌ, (S, * Msb,) like شَهْوَةٌ, and<br>\
upon each of these originals are founded modifications of the word, (Msb,) therefore it is mentioned in the K [and S and other lexicons] in the<br>\
present art. and again in art. سنو, (TA,) A year;<br>\
syn. حَوْلٌ; (Msb;) or عَامٌ: (M, K:) or, as Suh<br>\
says, in the R, the سَنَة is longer than the عَام; the<br>\
latter word being applied to the [twelve] Arabian<br>\
months [collectively], and thus differing from the<br>\
former word: (TA:) with the Arabs it consists<br>\
of four seasons, mentioned before [in art. زمن,<br>\
voce زَمَنٌ]: but sometimes it is tropically applied<br>\
to (tropical:)  a single فَصْل [or quarter]; as in the saying,<br>\
دَامَ المَطَرُ السَّنَةَ كُلَّهَا, meaning [The rain continued] during the فَصْل [or quarter, all of it]:<br>\
(Msb:) [see more in art. سنو and سنى:] the dim.<br>\
is ↓ سُنَيْهَةُ (S, Msb) accord. to those who make<br>\
the original of سَنَةٌ to be سَنْهَةٌ, (Msb,) and ↓ سُنَيَّةٌ<br>\
(S, Msb) accord. to those who make the original<br>\
of سَنَةٌ to be سَنْوَةٌ; (Msb;) and some say سُنَيْنَةٌ,<br>\
but this is rare: (TA:) the pl. is سَنَهَاتٌ (Msb, K)<br>\
accord. to those who make the original of سَنَةٌ to<br>\
be سَنْهةٌ, (Msb,) and سَنَوَاتٌ (Msb, K) accord. to<br>\
those who make the original of سَنَةٌ to be سَنْوَةٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) and سِنُونَ also, (S, Msb, K,) like the<br>\
masc. perfect pl., (Msb,) [agreeably with a rule<br>\
applying to other cases of this kind,] with kesr,<br>\
to the س, (S, TA,) and سِنِينَ [in the accus. and<br>\
gen. cases], (Msb, TA,) so that one says, هٰذِهِ<br>\
سِنُونَ [These are years], and رَأَيْتُ سِنِينَ [I saw<br>\
years], (TA,) and the ن is elided when it is prefixed to another noun, governing the latter in the<br>\
gen. case, (Msb,) and some say سُنُونَ, with damm<br>\
to the س; (S, TA;) and in one dial., the ى is<br>\
retained in all the cases, and the ن is made a<br>\
letter of declinability, with tenween when the<br>\
word is indeterminate, [so that one says سِنِينٌ,]<br>\
and is not elided when the word is prefixed to<br>\
another noun, governing the latter in the gen.<br>\
case, because it is [regarded as] one of the radical<br>\
letters of the word; and of this dial. is the saying<br>\
of the Prophet, اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْهَا عَلَيْهِمْ سِنِينًا كَسِنِينِ<br>\
يُوسُفَ [O God, make them to be to them years<br>\
like the years of Joseph]; (Msb; [but in my<br>\
copy of the Mgh, I find كَسِنِى يُوسُفَ;]) or with<br>\
respect to سِنِينٌ, like مِئِينٌ, with refa [and tenween], there are two opinions; one is, that it is<br>\
of the measure فِعْلِينٌ, like غِسْلِينٌ, with a rejection [of one letter], though this is an anomalous<br>\
pl., for there sometimes occurs among pls. that<br>\
which has no parallel, as عِدًى, and this is the opinion of Akh; the other is, that it is of the measure<br>\
فَعِيلٌ, changed to فِعِيلٌ because of the kesreh of<br>\
the second letter; the pl. being in some instances<br>\
of the measure فَعِيلٌ, like كَلِيبٌ and عَبِيدٌ; but<br>\
he who holds this opinion makes its final ن to be<br>\
a substitute for و, and that of مِائَةٌ a substitute<br>\
for ى: (S:) you may also suppress the tenween<br>\
in سِنِينٌ; [in which case it seems that one says<br>\
سِنِينَ in the nom. case (assimilating it to سِنُونَ)<br>\
as well as in the accus. and the gen.; like as one<br>\
does in the instances of بُرِين and بِرِين, pls. of<br>\
بُرَةٌ, accord. to the K, though, as I have shown<br>\
in art. برو, there is some doubt on this point;]<br>\
but the suppression of the tenween in سِنِينٌ is<br>\
more rare than its pronunciation: (I&#39; Ak p. 18:)<br>\
and another pl. is سُنِىٌّ, [originally سُنُوٌّ,] of the<br>\
measure فُعُولٌ. (Er-Rághib, TA in art. سنو.) The<br>\
phrase ثَلٰثَ مِائَةٍ سِنِينَ, in the Kur [xviii. 24],<br>\
is said by Akh to be for ثَلٰثَمِائَةٍ مِنَ السِّنِينَ [Three<br>\
hundred of years]: and he says that if the سِنُون<br>\
be an explicative of the مِائَة, it is in the gen. case<br>\
[to agree with مِائَةٍ]; and if an explicative of the<br>\
ثَلٰث, it is in the accus. case [to agree with ثَلٰثَ].<br>\
(S. [See also Bd on this phrase; and see De<br>\
Sacy&#39;s Ar. Gr., 2nd ed., i. 423.]) [لِسَنَةٍ, relating<br>\
to an animal or a plant or the like, means To the<br>\
completion of a year: and لِسَنَتِهِ, to the completion of his, or its, year; i. e. in his, or its, first<br>\
year.] And one says, ↓ لَقِيتُهُ مُنْذُ سُنَيَّاتٍ [I met<br>\
him some years ago; three or more, to ten, years<br>\
ago]: a phrase like لَقِيتُهُ ذَاتَ العُوَيْمِ. (Az, TA in<br>\
art. عوم.) And ↓ سُنَيَّةٌ is a dim. of enhancement,<br>\
of سَنَةٌ: one says سُنَيَّةٌ حَمْرَآءُ A severe year of<br>\
drought or barrenness or dearth: (TA:) and<br>\
البِيضِ ↓ وَقَعُوا فِى السُّنَيَّاتِ [They lapsed into the<br>\
severe years of scantiness of herbage]: these were<br>\
years that pressed hard upon the people of ElMedeeneh. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سَنَةٌ [alone] also signifies (tropical:)  Drought, or barrenness: (Msb, K, TA:)<br>\
or vehement, or intense, drought: (TA in art.<br>\
سنو:) an instance of a noun used especially in<br>\
one of its senses, like دَابَّةٌ applied to “ a horse,”<br>\
and مَالٌ applied to “ camels: ” pl., in this, as in<br>\
the former, sense, سَنَهَاتٌ [and سَنَوَاتٌ] and سِنُونَ<br>\
and سِنِينٌ. (TA.) One says of a land (أَرْضٌ),<br>\
أَصَابَتْهَا السَّنَةُ (tropical:)  Drought, or barrenness, befell it.<br>\
(Msb.) And in like manner one says of people,<br>\
أَصَابَتْهُمُ السَّنَهُ (tropical:)  [Drought, &amp;c., befell them]. (TA.)<br>\
A seeker of herbage and of a place in which to<br>\
alight was sent to a tract, and found it dried up<br>\
by want of rain, and when he returned, being<br>\
asked respecting it, he said, السَّنَةُ, meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  Drought, &amp;c. [has befallen it]. (TA.) And it<br>\
is said in a trad., اَللّٰهُمَّ أَعِنِّى عَلَى مُضَرَبِالسَّنَةِ, i. e.<br>\
(tropical:)  [O God, aid me against Mudar] by drought &amp;c.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also [used as an epithet,] applied<br>\
to land (أَرْضٌ), as meaning (tropical:)  Affected with<br>\
drought, or barrenness; (As, S, K;) as also<br>\
↓ سَنْهَآءُ and سَنْوَآءُ. (Msb.) One says likewise,<br>\
هٰذِهِ بِلَادٌ سِنِينٌ (tropical:)  These are countries, or tracts,<br>\
affected with drought &amp;c.: and Et-Tirimmáh<br>\
says<br>\
بِمُنْخَرَقٍ تَحِنُّ الرِّيحُ فِيهِ<br>\
حَنِينَ الحُلْبِ فِى البَلَدِ السِّنِينِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [In a gusty tract, the wind moaning therein<br>\
like the moaning of the milch ewes or goats (see<br>\
حَلُوبٌ) in the country affected with drought, or<br>\
the countries, &amp;c., بَلَد being regarded as a coll.<br>\
gen. n. and therefore qualified by a pl., like قَوْمٌ<br>\
in the phrase قَوْمٌ كَافِرُونَ]. (TA.)<br>\
سَنَهْ سَنَهْ, also pronounced with teshdeed to the<br>\
ن: see سَنًا, in art. سنو and سنى, last sentence.<br>\
طَعَامٌ سَنِهٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Food, or wheat,] that has undergone the lapse of years; (AZ, K;) as also سَنٍ.<br>\
(AZ, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also مُتَسَنِّهٌ.<br>\
نَخْلَةٌ سَنْهَآءُ (assumed tropical:)  A palm-tree that bears one year<br>\
and not another: (S, K:) or a palm-tree affected<br>\
by a year of drought. (S.) And سَنَةٌ سَنْهَآءُ A<br>\
year in which is no herbage nor rain. (TA.) ―<br>\

applied to bread and to beverage &amp;c., (CK, but<br>\

↓ مَسْنُوَّةٌ and ↓ مَسْنِيَّةٌ, (S, M, K,) meaning Watered,<br>\
or irrigated, land: (M:) the و in مَسْنِيَّةٌ being<br>\
changed into ى, (S, M,) in the opinion of Sb,<br>\
(M,) like as it is in قِنْيَةٌ; (S;) for he knew not<br>\
سَنَيْتُهَا [as meaning I watered it], holding مَسْنِيَّةٌ<br>\
to be from [سَنَاهَا having for its aor.] يَسْنُوهَا. (M.)<br>\

-b3-  And i. q. تَسَهَّلَ فِى أُمُورِهِ, said of a<br>\
man, (K,) i. e. He found, or experienced, ease,<br>\
or facility, in his affairs. (TK.)<br>\
-A3-  Also i. q.<br>\
تَرَضَّى: so in the phrase تسنّى فُلَانًا [He sought<br>\
to please, content, or satisfy, such a one; or he<br>\
pleased, contented, or satisfied, such a one, after<br>\
striving, labouring, or toiling]: (K:) but it is<br>\
said in the M, [app. a mistake, perhaps for the T,<br>\
for in the M I do not find it,] that سنيت فلانا<br>\
[by which may be meant either ↓ سَنَيْتُ or ↓ سَنَّيْتُ]<br>\
means ترضّيته. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  تَسَنَّيْتُ عِنْدَهُ I remained,<br>\
stayed, dwelt, or abode, with him, or at his abode,<br>\
a year; like تَسَنَّهْتُ عِنْدَهُ: (Msb in art. سنه:)<br>\
or it means ↓ أَقَمْتُ عِنْدَهُ سُنَيَّاتِ [I remained &amp;c.,<br>\
with him, or at his abode, some years; three or<br>\
more, to ten, years]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (TA,)<br>\
تسنّى signifies also It became altered [for the<br>\
worse], (S, K, TA,) accord. to Er-Rághib, so that<br>\
it lost its freshness, by the lapse of years: (TA:<br>\
[see also تَسَنَّهَ:]) but accord. to AA, it is from<br>\
the phrase in the Kur [xv. 26 and 28 and 33]<br>\
مِنْ حَمَأٍ مَسْنُونٍ; one of the نs being changed<br>\
into ى; and is similar to تَقَضَّى for تَقَضَّضَ. (S,<br>\
TA.)<br>\

اِسْتَنَوْا لِأَنْفُسِهِمْ: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  استنى النَّارَ He<br>\
looked at the light of the fire. (IAar, M.)<br>\
سَنًا Light: (Msb, MF:) or the light of lightning, (S, M, K,) and of fire: (M:) or the point,<br>\
or extremity, of the light of lightning: (T, TA:)<br>\
or light shining or gleaming, or diffusing itself<br>\
and rising: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or a high light:<br>\
and applied also to the shining, or gleaming, of<br>\
weapons: (Ham p. 271:) MF says that the apparent particularization in the K [&amp;c.] seems to<br>\
have been taken from the verse of the Kur<br>\
[xxiv. 43], and that the word is correctly a<br>\
general term, meaning as expl. in the Msb:<br>\
(TA:) [it is originally سَنَوٌ, though mentioned in<br>\
the K as belonging to art. سنى; for] the dual is<br>\
سَنَوَانِ: As knew not a verb belonging to it.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also [The cassia senna of Linn.; the<br>\
common senna of medicine; so called in the present day; and also called سَنَامَكَّة, and سَنَا حِجَازِىّ;]<br>\
a certain plant, (S, M, Msb, K,) used as a medicine; (S, TA;) and recommended in a trad.;<br>\
(TA;) an attenuant of the yellow bile and the<br>\
black bile and the phlegm, (K, TA,) howsoever<br>\
used; (TA;) [and] used as a collyrium; (M;)<br>\
AHn describes it as a shrub, or small tree, of the<br>\
[class called] أَغْلَاث [pl. of غَلَثٌ], which is mixed<br>\
with حِنَّآء, and improves and strengthens its<br>\
colour, and blackens it; and which has a fruit<br>\
of such kind that, when it dries up, and is put in<br>\
motion by the wind, it causes to be heard a sound<br>\
such as is termed زَجَل [q. v.]: (M in arts. سنو<br>\
and سنى, and TA:) its name is as above and<br>\
↓ سَنَآءٌ: (M, K:) and the n. un. is سَنَاةٌ and سَنَآءَةٌ:<br>\
(M in arts. سنو and سنى:) the dual of سَنًا is<br>\
سَنَيَانِ, and some say سَنَوَانِ. (M in art. سنى.)<br>\
[Accord. to a gloss. in a copy of the S, as stated<br>\
by Golius, the dual سَنَوَانِ is applied to The leaves<br>\
of cyprus (or حِنَّآء) and senna mixed together,<br>\
with which the hair is dyed black.] In the phrase<br>\
سَنَا المِسْكِ, in a verse of El-Jaadee, the plant<br>\
[above mentioned] may be meant, as though it<br>\
were mixed with musk: or it may be from سَنًا<br>\
signifying “ light; ” because the diffusion of odour<br>\
is like that of light. (M.)<br>\
-A3-  سَنَا, (JM,) or سَنَا<br>\
سَنَا, (TA,) without teshdeed, and also with tesh-deed, to the ن, is an Abyssinian expression,<br>\
meaning حَسُنَ [q. v.], (JM, TA,) occurring in a<br>\
trad. of Umm-Khálid; but it is differently related;<br>\
some saying سَنَهْ سَنَهْ; and some, سَنَان; and pronouncing each with, as well as without, teshdeed:<br>\
so in the Nh. (TA.)<br>\
طَعَامٌ سَنٍ [Food, or wheat,] that has undergone the lapse of years; as also سَنِهٌ. (AZ, TA<br>\
in art. سنه.)<br>\
سَنَةٌ, applied to a portion of time, (M,) signifying A year, syn. حَوْلٌ, (Mgh,) or عَامٌ, (K,) but<br>\
a distinction is made between عَامٌ and سَنَةٌ, [as<br>\
has been stated in art. سنه,] (TA,) belongs to<br>\
arts. سنو and سنه [in both of which it is mentioned in many of the lexicons: see what has been<br>\
said respecting it in art. سنه in the present work]:<br>\
(M:) accord. to Suh, in the R, it is from سَنَا,<br>\
aor. يَسْنُو, said of a beast [turning a water-wheel],<br>\
meaning “ he turned round about the well; ” so<br>\
that it signifies a single revolution of the sun;<br>\
and it is sometimes termed دَارٌ: he says also that<br>\
it is longer than the عَام, which is applied to the<br>\
[twelve] Arabian months [collectively]: but سَنَةٌ<br>\
is also applied to twelve revolutions of the moon:<br>\
the سَنَة شَمْسِيَّة [or solar year] is three hundred<br>\
and sixty-five days and a quarter of a day: and<br>\
the سَنَة قَمَرِيَّة [or lunar year] is three hundred<br>\
and fifty-four days and a third of a day: it is<br>\
also said, on the authority of Er-Rághib, that<br>\
سَنَةٌ is used as denoting a year in which is difficulty, and drought, or barrenness, or dearth; and<br>\
عَامٌ, as denoting that in which is ampleness of the<br>\
means, or circumstances, of life, and abundance<br>\
of herbage or the like; and by this is explained<br>\
the nice point in the words of the Kur [xxix. 13],<br>\
أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ إِلَّا خَمْسِينَ عَامًا [a thousand years save<br>\
fifty years]; because the fifty years passed before<br>\
the mission of the prophet [Noah], before which<br>\
no harm happened to him from his people; but<br>\
after his mission, the years were difficult to him.<br>\
(TA.) [Respecting the dims., (which are سُنّيَّةٌ<br>\
