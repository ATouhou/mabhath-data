[And I witness many persons of &#39;Owf, alighting<br>\
during their journeys, going repeatedly to and<br>\
fro to see Ez-Zibrikán&#39;s turban dyed with<br>\
saffron]: (S, M, Mgh:) for it was a custom of<br>\
the chiefs of the Arabs to dye their turbans with<br>\
saffron: or, as some say, the meaning is his<br>\
اِسْت; [but this is correctly, or more commonly,<br>\
termed سَبَّة;] and Ktr asserts that he was suspected: (M:) he says that Ez-Zibrikán used to<br>\
tinge his است yellow; but this is a strange saying.<br>\
(TA in art. زبرق.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, and ↓ سَبِيبَةٌ, An oblong<br>\

(TA:) the pl. of the former is سُبُوبٌ; (S, K,<br>\

a substitute for the [former] ب of سَبَّةٌ, in like<br>\
manner as it is substituted in the case of إِجَّاصٌ<br>\
and إِنْجَاصٌ; because [it is asserted, though this<br>\
is contradicted, that] there is no word of which<br>\
the radical letters are سنب. (M.) And مَا رَأَيْتُهُ<br>\
مُنْذُ سَبَّةٍ (assumed tropical:)  I have not seen him for, or during, a<br>\
space, or long space, of time; (S, K; *) like as<br>\

سَنْبَةً (assumed tropical:)  We lived in it a space, or long space, of<br>\
time. (Ks, TA.) And أَصَابَتْنَا سَبَّةٌ مِنَ الحَرِّ, and<br>\

صَارَ هٰذَا الأَمْرُ سُبَّةً عَلَيْهِ This thing became a disgrace to him, occasioning his being reviled. (S.)<br>\
And أَنْتَ سُبَّةٌ عَلَى قَوْمِكَ [Thou art a disgrace to<br>\
thy people]. (A.) [And ↓ مَسَبَّةٌ, in like manner,<br>\
(a word of the class of مَبْخَلَةٌ and مَجْبَنَةٌ, being<br>\
originally مَسْبَبَةٌ,) signifies A cause of reviling,<br>\
or of being reviled; as is shown by the saying of<br>\
Tufeyl El-Ghanawee, cited in the TA in art. عقب,<br>\
فَلَمْ يَجِدِ الأَقْوَامُ فِينَا مَسَبَّةً<br>\
And the people did not find in us a cause of<br>\
reviling, or of being reviled: pl. مَسَابُّ.] One<br>\
says, ↓ إِيَّاكَ وَالمَسَبَّةَ and المَسَابَّ [Beware thou<br>\
of, or avoid thou, the cause of reviling or of<br>\
being reviled, and the causes thereof]. (A.) ―<br>\

سَبَبٌ A rope, or cord; (S, M, A, Msb, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ سِبٌّ; (S, M, K;) the latter of the dial. of<br>\
Hudheyl, (S,) and occurring in this sense in a<br>\
verse of Aboo-Dhu-eyb cited voce خَيْطَةٌ; (S, M;)<br>\
accord. to some, as there meaning a wooden peg,<br>\
[a meaning assigned to it in the K,] but the<br>\
former is the correct meaning: (M:) the pl. of<br>\
both words is أَسْبَابٌ, (M, TA, *) [and] the pl. of<br>\
the latter word is سُبُوبٌ (S, TA) also: (TA:) or<br>\
سَبَبٌ signifies any rope let down, or made to<br>\
descend, from above: (AO, TA:) or a strong and<br>\
long rope, but no rope is so called except one by<br>\
means of which one ascends and descends: (Khálid<br>\
Ibn-Jembeh, TA:) or this appellation is only<br>\
given to a rope of which one end is attached to<br>\
a roof or ceiling or the like: (TA:) or one by<br>\
means of which one ascends palm-trees: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [and] a rope by means of which one<br>\
reaches, or gains access to, water. (TA.) فَلْيَمْدُدْ<br>\
بِسَبَبٍ إِلَى السَّمَآءِ ثُمَّ لِيَقْطَعْ, in the Kur [xxii. 15],<br>\
means Let him stretch a rope to the roof, or<br>\
ceiling, of his dwelling; then let him die strangled:<br>\
i. e. let him die of rage: (M, TA:) or, as some<br>\
say, let him stretch a rope to the lowest heaven;<br>\
then let him traverse the intervening space until<br>\
he reach the highest part thereof. (Bd.) The<br>\
saying<br>\
جَبَّتْ نِسَآءَ العَالَمِينَ بِالسَّبَبْ<br>\
has been expl. in art. جب: in this instance, a<br>\
rope or cord, may be meant; or a string, or<br>\
thread. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (Msb,) (tropical:)  A thing<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K) of any kind (S, Msb, K) by<br>\
means of which one attains, reaches, or gains<br>\
access to another thing: (S, M, Msb, K:) pl. as<br>\
above. (M.) One says, جَعَلْتُ فُلَانًا لِى سَبَبًا إِلَى<br>\
فُلَانٌ فِى حَاجَتِى, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [I made such a one] a<br>\
means of access [to such a one in the case of my<br>\
want]. (TA.) Hence, (M,) أَسْبَابُ السَّمَآءِ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
places of ascent of the heaven, or sky: (M, K:)<br>\
or the tracts, or regions, thereof: (S, K:) or the<br>\

a verse cited voce ثَمَانُونَ.]) And the saying,<br>\

attained to excellence] in religion. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\

saying, in the Kur xviii. 88 and 91, ثُمَّ اتَّبَعَ سَبَبًا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Then he followed a road, or way]. (Bd.)<br>\
[And] so in the saying, مَا لِى إِلَيْهِ سَبَبٌ (assumed tropical:)  [There<br>\
is not for me any road, or way, to him, or it].<br>\
(A.) So too ↓ سَبِيبَةٌ: pl. سَبَائِبُ. (Ham p. 347.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  [(assumed tropical:)  A mean, or means, used in order to any<br>\
end: a means by which a thing is brought about:<br>\

the cause, or occasion, of this]. (Msb.) And<br>\

or prepare, for thee a means, or cause, of good,<br>\
or prosperity]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (tropical:)  A connexion, or tie,<br>\
(S, A, K, TA,) of relationship (S, K, TA) by<br>\
marriage; distinguished from نَسَبٌ, which is by<br>\
birth: from the same word as signifying “ a rope<br>\
by means of which one reaches, or gains access<br>\
to, water. ” (TA.) One says, اِنْقَطَعَ بَيْنَهُمُ السَّبَبُ<br>\
i. e. (tropical:)  The connexion, or tie, [of affinity between<br>\
them was severed,] and الأَسْبَابُ the connexions, or<br>\
ties. (A) وَتَقَطَّعَتْ بِهِمُ الأَسْبَابُ [in the Kur ii.<br>\
161] means, accord. to I&#39;Ab, (assumed tropical:)  And their ties<br>\
and affections [shall be dissundered]: or, accord.<br>\
