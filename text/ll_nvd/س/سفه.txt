سَفِهَ, (S, MA, Msb,) aor.<br>\
سَفَهَ; (Msb;) and<br>\
سَفُهَ, [aor.<br>\
سَفُهَ;] (S, Msb;) inf. n. سَفَهٌ and سَفَاهَةٌ<br>\
(S, MA, Msb, K *) and سَفَاهٌ, (S, MA, K, *) [all<br>\
mentioned in the MA as of the former verb, and<br>\
so in the TA when that verb is trans., but<br>\
properly] the first is of the former verb, and<br>\
the second is of the latter verb, (S, Msb,) and<br>\
so is the third; (S;) He (a man, S) was, or<br>\
became, such as is termed سَفِيه; (S, TA;) [i. e.]<br>\
he was, or became, unwise, witless, or destitute of<br>\
wisdom or understanding, or [rather] lightwitted.<br>\
(MA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The phrase سَفِهَ نَفْسَةُ, [of which an<br>\
instance occurs in the Kur ii. 124, and] to which<br>\
غَبِنَ رَأْيَهُ and بَطِرَ عَيْضْلَرRَهُ and أَلِمَ بَطْنَهُ and وَفِقَ أَمْرَهُ<br>\
and رَضْلَرRِدَ أَمْرَهُ are similar, was originally سَفِهَتْ<br>\
نَفْسُ زَيْدٍ [or rather سَفِهَتْ نَفْسُهُ i. e. Himself, or<br>\
his mind, was, or became, lightwitted, &amp;c.]; but<br>\
when [the dependence of] the verb became transferred [from the نفس] to the man, what followed<br>\
the verb was put in the accus. case by being its<br>\
objective complement, for the phrase became<br>\
identical in meaning with نَفْسَهُ ↓ سَفَّهَ [he made<br>\
himself, or his mind, lightwitted, &amp;c.]: so say the<br>\
Basrees and Ks; and it is allowable with them to<br>\
make this accus. to precede [the verb]; like as it<br>\
is allowable to say, غُلَامَهُ ضَرَب زَيْدٌ: (S, TA:)<br>\
accord. to the K, the verb thus used has three<br>\
forms; (TA;) you say سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ and رَأْيَهُ, (K,<br>\
TA,) and حِلْمَهُ, (TA,) and سَفُهَ, and سَفَهَ, meaning حَمَلَهُ عَلَىالسَّفَهِ [which is virtually the same<br>\
as سَفَّهَهُ i. e. he made himself, or his mind, lightwitted, or unwise, &amp;c., and in like manner his<br>\
judgment, or opinion, and he made his gravity,<br>\
or forbearance, or the like, to become levity, or<br>\
hastiness, &amp;c.]: or he attributed سَفَه [i. e. lightwittedness, &amp;c., to himself, or his mind, and to<br>\
his judgment, or opinion]: or he destroyed it;<br>\
(K, TA;) agreeably with the meaning assigned<br>\
to سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ by AO: (TA:) or this means he<br>\
held himself in mean, or light, estimation; (MA,<br>\
and Ksh and Bd in ii. 124;) and rendered himself low, base, or contemptible: (Bd ibid.:) but<br>\
Lh says that سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ, with kesr [to the ف],<br>\
inf. n. سَفَهٌ and سَفَاهَةٌ and سَفَاهٌ, means حَمَلَهُ عَلَى<br>\
السَّفَهِ [or حَمَلَهَا], and is the approved form,<br>\
and that some say سَفُهَ, which is rare: and accord.<br>\
to J and others, (TA,) when they say سفه نَفْسَهُ, and<br>\
رَأْيَهُ, they do not say it otherwise than with kesr<br>\
[to the ف], because فَعُلَ is not trans.: (S, TA:)<br>\
so that the three forms of the verb mentioned in<br>\
the K require consideration: (TA:) accord. to<br>\
Fr, when [the dependence of] the verb in the<br>\
phrase سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ became transferred from the<br>\
نفس to the possessor thereof, what followed the<br>\
verb became an explicative, to indicate that the<br>\
سَفَه [or lightwittedness, &amp;c.,] was therein; and by<br>\
rule it should be سَفِهَ زَيْدٌ نَفْسًا, for the explicative<br>\
should not be otherwise than indeterminate; but<br>\
it was left in its state of a prefixed noun, and put<br>\
in the accus. case in the manner of an indeterminate noun as being likened thereto; [the meaning, therefore, accord. to him, is he was, or<br>\
became, lightwitted, &amp;c., as to his mind;] it is<br>\
not allowable, however, in his opinion, to make<br>\
this accus. to precede [the verb], because the explicative may not precede; and similar to this is<br>\
the phrase ضِقْتُ بِهِ ذَرْعًا, and طِبْتُ بِهِ نَفْسًا, meaning ضَاقَ ذَرْعِىبِهِ and طَابَتْ نَفْسِى بِهِ: (S, TA:)<br>\
but this saying [of Fr] is disallowed by the<br>\
grammarians; for they say that explicatives are<br>\
indeterminate, and that determinate nouns may<br>\
not be used as indeterminate: some of the grammarians say that إِلَّامَنْ سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ in the Kur<br>\
[ii. 124] means الّا من سَفِهَ فِىنَفْسِهِ [but he who<br>\
is lightwitted, &amp;c., in his mind], i. e., who becomes<br>\
سَفِيه; [the prep.] فى being suppressed [and the<br>\
noun therefore put in the accus. case agreeably<br>\
with a general rule]: Zj holds that the approvable saying is, that it means إِلَّا مَنْ جَهِلَ نَفْسَهُ,<br>\
i. e., but he who is [ignorant or silly or foolish or]<br>\
unreflecting in his mind: and in like manner,<br>\
سَفِهَ رَأْيَهُ means جَهِلَهُ [i. e. he was ignorant, &amp;c.,<br>\
in his judgment, or opinion]; and his judgment,<br>\
or opinion, was unsound, without rectitude: and<br>\
سَفِهَ نَفْسَهُ signifies also he lost himself, or his own<br>\
soul. (TA.) سَفِهَ الحَقَّ is likewise expl. as meaning الحَقَّ ↓ سَفَّهَ [He made the truth, or right, to<br>\
be foolishness, or the like]; and Yoo held the one<br>\
to be a dial. var. of the other, and the measure of<br>\
the former verb to denote intensiveness; and<br>\
accord. to this explanation one may say, سَفِهْتُ<br>\
زَيْدًا meaning زَيْدًا ↓ سَفَّهْتُ [I pronounced Zeyd<br>\
lightwitted, &amp;c.]: or the meaning is جَهِلَ الحَقَّ<br>\
[he ignored the truth, or right], and he did not<br>\
see it to be the truth, or right: (TA:) or he regarded the truth, or right, as foolishness, or ignorance. (S and TA in art. غمط.) See also 2. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
سَفِهَ عَلَيْهِ signifies جَهِلَ [i. e., when thus trans.<br>\
by means of عَلَى, He feigned ignorance to him];<br>\
as also سَفُهَ, (K, TA,) and ↓ تسافه. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
سَفِهْتُ نَصِيبِى [and it is implied in the K that<br>\
one says سَفَهْتُ نصيبى also, but only the former<br>\
is authorized by the TA,] I forgot my share, or<br>\
portion. (Th, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And سَفَهَ صَاحِبَهُ, aor.<br>\
سَفُهَ,<br>\
He overcame his companion in what is termed<br>\
مُسَافَهَة [inf. n. of 3, q. v.]. (K.) You say, ↓ سَافَهَهُ<br>\
فَسَفَهَهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  سَفِهَتِ الطَّعْنَةُ, (JK, K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. سَفَهٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  The spear-wound, or the like,<br>\
emitted blood which came from it quickly (JK,<br>\
K, TA) and dried up (وَجَفَّ [in the TK وِخف]):<br>\
(K, TA:) so in the A. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  سَفِهَ الضْلَرRَّرَابَ,<br>\
(S, K,) inf. n. سَفَهٌ, (TA,) He drank much of<br>\
the beverage, or wine, without having his thirst<br>\
satisfied thereby. (S, K, TA.) See also 3. And<br>\
سَفِهَ المَآءَ (tropical:)  He drank the water immoderately.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And سَفِهْتُ and سَفَهْتُ signify ضْلَرRُغِلْتُ,<br>\
(so in the CK,) in [some of] the copies of the K<br>\
ضْلَرRَغَلْتُ, but the right reading is ضْلَرRُغِلْتُ [i. e. I was<br>\
occupied, or busied, or diverted from a thing]:<br>\
or, accord. to the copies of the K, تَضْلَرRَغَّلْتُ; but<br>\
correctly, or ضْلَرRَغَلْتُ [i. e. I occupied, or busied, or<br>\
diverted from a thing]. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
سَفَّهَ see 5. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] سِفِهِهُ, inf. n. تَسْفِيهٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) signifies جَعَلَهُ سَفِيهًا [i. e. He, or it,<br>\
made him to be, or he pronounced him to be,<br>\
lightwitted, &amp;c.]; as also ↓ سَفِهَهُ; (K, TA;) on<br>\
the authority of Akh and Yoo: (TA:) or he<br>\
attributed to him what is termed سَفَه [i. e. lightwittedness, &amp;c.]: (S, Msb:) or he said to him<br>\
that he was such as is termed سَفِيه. Msb.) And<br>\
سفّه الجَهْلُ حِلْمَهُ Ignorance made him light, inconstant, unsteady, irresolute, or fickle; syn.<br>\
أَطَاضْلَرRَهُ and أَخَفَّهُ. (TA.) See also 1, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
3<br>\
سافههُ, (S, MA, K,) inf. n. مُسَافَهَةٌ, (S, KL,)<br>\
He acted [in a lightwitted manner,] foolishly, or<br>\
ignorantly, with him; (MA, KL;) showed lightness, levity, weakness of mind, and lack of حِلْم<br>\
[or gravity, &amp;c.], with him. (KL.) You say,<br>\
سَافَهَهُ فَسَفَهَهُ: see 1, near the end of the paragraph.<br>\
[سافهه in this instance may mean as above, or<br>\
may have the meaning here next following.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
He reviled him; or he reviled him, being reviled<br>\
by him; syn. ضْلَرRَاتَمَهُ: whence the prov., سَفِيهٌ لَمْ<br>\
↓ يَجِدْ مُسَافِهًا [A lightwitted person found not a<br>\
reviler, or mutual reviler]; (K, TA;) mentioned<br>\
in the S. (TA.) [See also 5.] ―<br>\
-b3-  سافه الدَّنَّ, (S,<br>\
K,) or الوَطْبَ, (S,) (assumed tropical:)  He sat with (قَاعَدَ) the دنّ<br>\
[or wine-jar], (S, K,) or the وطب [or milk-skin],<br>\
(S,) and drank from it while after while. (S, K.)<br>\
And سافه الضْلَرRَّرَابَ (tropical:)  He exceeded the due bounds in<br>\
respect of the beverage, or wine, drinking it without measure; (K, TA;) as also ↓ سَفِهَهُ. (K.)<br>\
And سَافَهْتُ المَآءَ (tropical:)  I drank the water immoderately, (Lh, TA,) or without measure. (A, TA.)<br>\
[See also 1, near the end of the paragraph.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And سَافَهَتِ النَّاقَةُ الطَّرِيقَ (tropical:)  The she-camel kept to<br>\
the road, or way, (A, K, TA,) or took to it, (A,<br>\
TA,) with a vehement pace: (A, K, TA:) or<br>\
was light, or agile, in her pace, or going. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَسْفَهْتُهُ I found him to be سَفِيه [i. e. lightwitted, &amp;c.]. (TA. [There said to be tropical;<br>\
but I see not why.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَسْفَهَكَ اللّٰه الضْلَرRَّرَابَ (assumed tropical:)  May<br>\
God make thee to drink of the beverage, or wine,<br>\
without having thy thirst satisfied thereby: or<br>\
أَسْفَهَهُ اللّٰهُ God made him, or may God make<br>\
him, to drink without having his thirst satisfied:<br>\
(S, accord. to different copies:) or اسفه اللّٰهُ فُلَانَّا<br>\
المَآءَ God made, or may God make, such a one to<br>\
drink much water. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تسفّهت الرِّيَاحُ The winds became in a state<br>\
of commotion. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تسفّهت الرِّيحُ الضْلَرRَّجَرَ,<br>\
(S,) or الغُصُونَ, (K, TA,) and الرِّيحُ ↓ سَفَّهَتِ<br>\
الغُصُونَ, (Ham p. 359,) The wind made the trees,<br>\
(S,) or the branches, (K,) to bend, or incline:<br>\
(S, K:) and put the branches in motion: (K,<br>\
and Ham ubi suprà:) or ruffled, and put in<br>\
motion, the branches. (TA. [There said to be<br>\
tropical: but see what is said of the primary<br>\
signification of سَفَهٌ, below.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] it is<br>\
said in a prov., فُرَارَةٌ تَسَفَّهَتْ قَرَارَةً A lamb, or kid,<br>\
made a sheep, or goat, to incline [to silly behaviour]: applied to the old whom the young<br>\
incites to lightwittedness (السَّفَه) and levity.<br>\
(Meyd. [See also a similar prov. in Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Prov., ii. 253.]) ―<br>\

paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  [And تسافهوا They behaved in a<br>\
lightwitted, foolish, or ignorant, manner, one<br>\
with another. See also 3, which has a similar<br>\
meaning. ―<br>\
-b3-  And They reviled one another: as<br>\
seems to be indicated in the TA. See also Har<br>\
p. 522: and see, again, 3.] ―<br>\
-b4-  تَسَافَهُ أَضْلَرRْدَاقُهَا, in a<br>\
verse of Khalaf Ibn-Is-hák El-Bahránee, [describing swift camels,] means Their sides of the<br>\
mouth casting forth their foam, one at another:<br>\
like the saying of El-Jarmee,<br>\
تَسَافَهُ أَضْلَرRْدَاقُهَا بِاللُّغَامِ<br>\
[Their sides of the mouth casting forth the foam,<br>\
one at another]. (TA. [تسافه, there written<br>\
without any syll. signs, is app. thus, (for تَتَسَافَهُ,)<br>\
not تُسَافِهُ.])<br>\
سَفَهٌ, (S, TA,) as also ↓ سَفَاهَةٌ and ↓ سَفَاهٌ, (TA,)<br>\
[all mentioned as inf. ns. in the first paragraph of<br>\
this art.,] primarily signifies خِفَّةٌ [in its proper<br>\
sense of Lightness], and motion, commotion, or<br>\
agitation. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence (S, TA) the<br>\
first, (S, K, TA,) like each of the others, (K,<br>\
TA,) signifies [generally Lightwittedness, or the<br>\
like;] the contr. of حِلْمٌ; (S, K, TA;) [i. e.] خِفَّةٌ<br>\
[as meaning lightness or levity, inconstancy,<br>\
unsteadiness, irresoluteness; or lightness or levity,<br>\
&amp;c., and hastiness; for, as is said in the TA in<br>\
art. رجح, the contr. of حِلْمٌ is described by the<br>\
terms خِفَّةٌ and عَجَلٌ, like as حِلْمٌ is described by<br>\
the term ثِقَلٌ]; and slenderness, shallowness, or<br>\
weakness, of judgment; qualities which deficiency<br>\
of intellect, or understanding, necessarily involves:<br>\
(Bd in ii. 12, in explanation of سَفَهٌ:) or خِفَّةُ حِلْمٍ<br>\
[i. e. slightness of gravity or staidness or sedateness or calmness &amp;c.]: or جَهْلٌ [i. e. ignorance,<br>\
or silliness or foolishness]: (K, TA:) all of which<br>\
explanations are nearly alike: (TA:) or سَفَهٌ is a<br>\
deficiency in intellect or understanding: (Msb:)<br>\
or a lightness, or levity, accidental to a man,<br>\
arising from joy or anger, inducing him to act<br>\
unreasonably and unlawfully. (KT.)<br>\
سَفَاهٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
سَفيِهٌ [Having the quality termed سَفَهٌ; i. e.,<br>\
accord. to the explanation of the primary signification of the latter, above, Light; and in a state<br>\
of motion, commotion, or agitation:] applied to a<br>\
camel&#39;s nose-rein, (S, K,) light: (S:) or quivering; (K, TA;) because of the she-camel&#39;s shaking<br>\
it, and contending in pulling it. (TA: but there<br>\
said to be, when thus applied, tropical.) Dhu-rRummeh says,<br>\
عَلَى ظَهْرِ مِقْلَاتٍ سَفِيهٍ جَدِيلُهَا<br>\
i. e. [Upon the back of a she-camel that had<br>\
brought forth but once and not conceived after,]<br>\
whose nose-rein was light. (S. In the TA,<br>\
زِمَامُهَا is here put in the place of جَدِيلُهَا.) And<br>\
one says also نَاقَةٌ سَفِيهَةُ الزِمَامِ, (K, TA,) meaning<br>\
[A she-camel whose nose-rein is light, or quivering:<br>\
or] light, or agile, in pace or going. (TA: in<br>\
which this, also, is said to be tropical.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
Lightwitted; light of intellect or understanding;<br>\
(TA;) deficient in intellect or understanding;<br>\
(Msb;) ignorant; (Mujáhid, K, TA;) weak;<br>\
foolish, stupid, unsound in intellect or understanding, dull therein, or having little, or no,<br>\
intellect, or understanding; (Mujáhid, TA;) and<br>\
↓ سَافِهٌ, also, [which is syn. with سَفِيهٌ in all the<br>\
senses mentioned above,] is expl. by IAar as<br>\
having this last meaning of foolish, stupid, &amp;c.:<br>\
(TA:) the fem. is سَفِيهَةٌ: (Msb, K:) and the pl.<br>\
of the masc., (K,) or of the masc. and fem.,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) is سُفَهَآءُ, (Msb, K, TA,) and of both,<br>\
سِفَاهٌ, and of the fem., سَفِيهَاتٌ also and سَفَائِهُ and<br>\
سُفَّهٌ. (K, TA.) In the Kur ii. 282, سَفِيهًا means,<br>\
accord. to Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, Ignorant of the ordinances, or statutes; one who does not dictate well,<br>\
and knows not what dictation is; for he who is<br>\
ignorant in all his circumstances may not deal<br>\
with another upon credit: accord. to ISd, ignorant<br>\
or صَغِير [meaning under the age of puberty]; not<br>\
ignorant of dictating, as Lh asserts it to mean,<br>\
because it is added, “or not able to dictate, himself: ” this, says Er-Rághib, denotes سَفَه in respect of worldly matters: in the Kur lxxii. 4,<br>\
سَفِيهُنَا denotes سَفَه in religion. (TA.) In the<br>\
Kur iv. 4, the pl. السُّفَهَآء is said to mean Women,<br>\
and young children; because they are ignorant<br>\
of the proper object of expense: and I&#39;Ab is<br>\
related to have said that women are termed السُّفَّهُ<br>\
and السُّفَهَآءُ: (Lh, TA:) Az, also, says that a<br>\
woman is termed سَفِيهَةٌ because of the weakness<br>\
of her intellect, and because she does not manage<br>\
well her property; and in like manner are termed<br>\
children as long as they are not known to be<br>\
characterized by maturity of intellect, and rectitude of actions, and good management of affairs.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ثَوْبٌ سَفِيهٌ (tropical:)  A garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth, badly woven; thin, flimsy, unsubstantial,<br>\
or scanty in the yarn. (K, * TA.)<br>\
سَفَاهَةٌ: see سَفَهٌ.<br>\
سَافِهٌ: see سَفيهٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, applied to a man,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Vehemently thirsty: and so سَاهِفٌ. (Az, TA.)<br>\
وَادٍ مُسْفَهٌ (tropical:)  A valley filled [with water]: (K,<br>\
TA:) as though it exceeded the due bounds, and<br>\
became such as is termed سَفِيه: imagined to be<br>\
from أسْفَهْتُهُ signifying “ I found him to be سَفِيه. ”<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
طَعَامٌ مَسْفَهَةٌ, (K, TA, in the CK [erroneously]<br>\
مُسْفِهٌ,) as also مَسْهَفَةٌ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  Food that incites<br>\
[in the CK يُتْعِبُ is erroneously put for يَبْعَتُ] to<br>\
the drinking of much water. (IAar, * K, TA.)<br>\
مُسَافِهٌ act. part. n. of 3, q. v.<br>\

going, and in flying. (S, M.)<br>\
-A2-  سَفَتِ الرِّيحُ التُّرابَ,<br>\
(S, M, Mgh, K,) aor. تَسْفِي, (S, K,) inf. n. سَفْيٌ,<br>\
(S, M,) The wind raised the dust, or made it to<br>\
fly, and carried it away, or dispersed it; (S,<br>\
Mgh, K;) and cast it: (Mgh:) or bore it, carried<br>\
it, or carried it away; (M, K;) as also ↓ أَسْفَتْهُ,<br>\
(K,) a dial. var. of weak authority, mentioned by<br>\
Sgh on the authority of Fr; (TA;) [or it may be<br>\
thus expl. by a mistake originating from the fact<br>\
that] IAar mentions سَفَتِ الرِّيحُ and أسْفَتْ, [as<br>\
syn.,] but [in a sense to be expl. hereafter,] not<br>\
making either of them trans.: (M:) [and ↓ سَافَتِ<br>\
الرِّيحُ التُّرَابَ occurs in the M and L in art. سنف:]<br>\
and تَسْفِي بِهِ, relating to the wind and the dust,<br>\
also occurs; the ب being redundant, or added<br>\
because the verb implies the meaning of رَمَت<br>\
[which is trans. by means of بِ]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And سَفَتِ الرِيحُ The wind blew; as also ↓ أسْفَت.<br>\

سَفِيَتْ يَدُهُ His hand became much cracked, or<br>\

said of the wind, intrans. and trans.: see 1, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
-A3-  اسفى said of corn, It became<br>\
rough, or coarse, in the extremities [or awn] of<br>\
its ears. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اسفت said of بُهْمَى [or<br>\
barley-grass], It let fall its سَفَا [or prickles, or<br>\
awn, or extremities]. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اسفى<br>\
said of a man, He took the prickles [or awn or<br>\
extremities] of the بُهْمَى [or barley-grass]. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  Also, said of a man, He removed dust, or<br>\
earth, (سَفًا, TA) from one place to another.<br>\
(Az, K.)<br>\
-A5-  And اسفت said of a she-camel, (tropical:)  She<br>\
became lean, or emaciated, (K,) so that she was<br>\
like the سَفا [or prickles of barley-grass]. (TA.)<br>\
-A6-  See also 1, last sentence.<br>\
-A7-  اسفاهُ It (an<br>\
affair, or event, M) incited him (a man, K) to<br>\
unsteadiness, and levity. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,<br>\
perhaps, (M,) اسفى بِهِ He did evil or ill, or<br>\
acted ill, to him, or with him, (M, K,) i. e., his<br>\
companion. (M.)<br>\
8<br>\
استفى وَجْهَهُ i. q. اِصْطَرَفَهُ, (Sgh, K,) i. e. He<br>\
turned away his face. (TK.)<br>\
سَفًا Lightness, thinness, or scantiness, in the<br>\
hair of the forelock, (S, M, Mgh, K,) of the horse,<br>\
in which it is discommended, (S, * Z, Mgh,) and<br>\
of the mule and ass, in both of which it is commended: (Z, Mgh:) or shortness, and scantiness,<br>\
of the forelock: accord. to Th, it is ↓ سَفَآءٌ, with<br>\
medd: which is metaphorically used by a poet<br>\
as meaning scantiness in milk. (M.) [Accord.<br>\
to the TK, the former is an inf. n., of which<br>\
the verb is ↓ سَفِىَ, said of a horse, as meaning<br>\
He was, or became, light, thin, or scanty, in the<br>\
forelock.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And, accord. to IAar, A whiteness<br>\
[or a tinge thereof] in the hair [of a horse]:<br>\
particularly said by him in one place to be such<br>\
as is termed أَدْهَم, and such as is أَضْلَرRْقَر. (M, in<br>\
art. سفو.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, [but more properly written<br>\
سَفًى, the last radical in this case being ىِ,]<br>\
Dust, or earth; (S, M, K;) and so ↓ سَافٍ:<br>\
(TA:) or this is applied to earth, or dust, [as<br>\
meaning pouring down,] from سَفَى التُّرَابُ [expl.<br>\
above]: (Ham p. 454:) the former signifies dust,<br>\
or earth, though not raised and carried away, or<br>\
dispersed, by the wind: or, accord. to the T,<br>\
whatever is raised and carried away, or dispersed, by the wind: (TA:) accord. to IAar,<br>\
dust, or earth, taken forth from a grave or a<br>\
well: (M:) سَفَاةٌ is a more special term, (S,) the<br>\
n. un., (M,) سَفَاةٌ مِنْ تُرَابٍ signifying a collection<br>\
(كُبَّةٌ) of dust, or earth. (Ham p. 810.)<br>\
-A3-  Also<br>\
Any kind of tree having prickles, or thorns:<br>\
(K: [but this seems to have been erroneously<br>\
taken from what here follows:]) the prickles [or<br>\
awn or beard] of بُهْمَى [or barley-grass], (S, M,)<br>\
and of the ears of corn, [of wheat or barley,<br>\
(TA in art. خدضْلَرR,)] and of anything having<br>\
prickles: accord. to Th, the extremities of بُهْمَى:<br>\
n. un. سَفَاةٌ, as above. (M.)<br>\
-A4-  Also Leanness,<br>\
or emaciation, (K, TA,) in consequence of disease.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A5-  It is also an inf. n. of سَفِىَ as syn. with<br>\
سَفِهَ, expl. above. (M, K.)<br>\
سَفَآءٌ: see the first sentence of the next preceding<br>\
paragraph: it is expl. in the K [and also in the<br>\
M] as signifying A stopping, stopping short, or<br>\
ceasing, of the she-camel&#39;s milk: and ISd cites<br>\
[in the M, after Th], from a poet, the phrase<br>\
فَى أَلْبَانِهِنَّ سَفَآءُ [ending a verse,] referring to<br>\
[she-camels such as are termed] قَلَائِص: but Az<br>\
relates it differently, فِى أَلْبابِهِنَّ with ب [in the<br>\
place of ن]; saying that سَفَآءٌ means lightness, or<br>\
levity, in anything; and ignorance; and that the<br>\
phrase, as he cites it, means in whose faculties of<br>\
understanding is lightness. (TA.) [See 1, last<br>\
sentence: and] see also what next follows.<br>\
سِفَآءٌ, accord. to the K, signifies A medicine, or<br>\
remedy: [see 3, last signification:] but this<br>\
requires consideration; for it is said in the M,<br>\
[↓ السَّفَآءُ signifies unsteadiness, and levity; and<br>\
IAar says,] السَّفَآءُ from السَّفِىُّ is like الضْلَرRَّقَآءُ from<br>\
الضْلَرRَّقِىُّ. (TA.)<br>\
سَفِىُّّ Dust raised, or made to fly, and carried<br>\
away, or dispersed, by the wind; (S, K;) and<br>\
(K) so ↓ سَافٍ, (M, K,) i. q. ↓ مَسْفِىٌّ; a possessive<br>\
epithet, or of the measure فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولٌ. (M. [See another explanation<br>\
of سَاف voce سَفًا, from the Hamáseh. Freytag<br>\
explains both سَفِىٌّ and سَافٍ, as on the authority<br>\
of the K, as epithets applied to the wind, not to<br>\
the dust.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Clouds; [app. as being driven<br>\
by the wind;] syn. سَحَابٌ. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  And i. q. سَفِيهٌ<br>\
[Lightwitted, &amp;c.: see 1, last sentence]. (M, K.)<br>\
[And it seems to be indicated in the S that ↓ سَافٍ<br>\
is syn. with سَافِهٌ, which is syn. with سَفِيهٌ.]<br>\
سَفَّآءٌ: see مُسْفٍ.<br>\
سَافٍ: fem. سَافِيَةٌ, pl. سَوَافٍ: see this last in the<br>\
next paragraph: ―<br>\
-b2-  and for the first, see سَفًا: and<br>\
سَفِىٌّ, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-  See also سَفِىٌّ again, last<br>\
sentence.<br>\
سَافِيَآءُ Dust, syn. غُبَارٌ: (M, K:) or dust (تُرَابٌ)<br>\
and dry herbage or the like: (Ham p. 445:) or<br>\
dust (تُرَابٌ) with the wind: (M:) or wind that<br>\
bears, or carries, or carries away, dust, (M, K,<br>\
TA,) much, upon the surface of the earth, impelling it against men: (TA, and in like manner<br>\
in the Ham ubi suprà:) and ↓ رِيَاحٌ سَوَافٍ, (TA,)<br>\
pl. of رِيحٌ سَافِيَةٌ, (Ham ubi suprà,) winds that<br>\
raise the dust, or make it to fly, and carry it<br>\
away, or disperse it: you say, لَعِبَتْ بِهِ السَّوَافَى<br>\
[The winds raising the dust, &amp;c., made sport with<br>\
him, or it]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also Tracks, or streaks,<br>\
upon a pool put in motion by the wind: so says<br>\
Freytag; but he names not any authority for<br>\
this.]<br>\
أسْفَى applied to a horse, (As, S, M, Mgh,)<br>\
Light, thin, or scanty, in the hair of the forelock:<br>\
(As, S, M, Mgh, K:) or short and scanty therein:<br>\
fem. سَفْوَآءُ: (M:) [and accord. to some, it seems<br>\
to be in like manner applied to a mule and an ass:<br>\
(see سَفًا:)] one says فَرَسٌ أَسْفَى and بَغْلَةٌ سَفْوَآءُ:<br>\
(Mgh:) [or,] accord. to As, أَسْفَى in the sense<br>\
first expl. above is not applied to anything but a<br>\
horse: applied to a mule, it means (assumed tropical:)  quick, or<br>\
swift: (S:) or بَغْلَةٌ سَفْوَآءُ signifies (tropical:)  a she-mule<br>\
that is quick, or swift, (S, M, A, K, TA,) like the<br>\
wind, (A, TA,) active, or light, (S,) of middling<br>\
make, compact and strong in the back; (M, TA;)<br>\
and in like manner سَفْوَآءُ is applied to a wild she-ass. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to IAar, الأَسْفَى applied to<br>\
the horse signifies اَلَّذِي تَنْزِعُهُ ضْلَرRَعَرَةٌ بَيْضَآءُ [app.<br>\
meaning Distinguished by some white hairs,<br>\
though I find no authority for thus rendering the<br>\
verb here used] whether he be bay or of some<br>\
other colour: or having that whiteness of the<br>\
hair which is termed سَفًا [expl. above], which is<br>\
particularly said by him in one place to be in<br>\
such as is termed أَدْهَم, and such as is أَضْلَرRْقَر: and<br>\
the fem. in this sense also is as above. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
One says also رِيحٌ هَوْجَآءُ, meaning (tropical:)  A swift wind;<br>\
like as one says مُسْفٍ. (TA.)<br>\
مُسْفٍ [and, accord. to Golius, ↓ سَفَّآءٌ, mentioned<br>\
by him as on the authority of the K, in which,<br>\
however, I do not find it, nor did Freytag,] A<br>\
calumniator, or slanderer. (K.)<br>\
