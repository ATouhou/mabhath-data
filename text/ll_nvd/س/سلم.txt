سَلِمَ, [aor.<br>\
سَلَمَ,] inf. n. سَلَامَةٌ (S, M, A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K) and سَلَامٌ (A, TA) and سَلَمٌ and سَلْمٌ<br>\
and سِلْمٌ, (Bd in xxxix. 30,) He was, or became,<br>\
safe, or secure; or he escaped; (M, TA;) or he was,<br>\
or became, free; (TA;) مِنَ الآفَاتِ [from evils of<br>\
any kind], (S, Mgh,) or مِنَ الآفَةِ [from evil of any<br>\
kind], (K,) or مِنَ البَلَآءِ [from trial, or affliction],<br>\
(A, TA,) or مِنَ الأَمْرِ [from the affair]: (M:) he<br>\
(a traveller) was, or became, safe, secure, or free,<br>\
from evils of any kind: (Msb:) and سَلِمَ مِنَ العَيْبِ<br>\
he was, or became, free from fault, defect, imperfection, blemish, or vice; syn. بَرِئَ. (Msb in<br>\
art. برأ.) [Hence,] one says, لَا بِذِى تَسْلَمُ مَا كَانَ<br>\
گَذَا وَكَذَا, (ISk, S, K, *) meaning No, by God [or<br>\
Him] who maketh thee to be in safety, (ISk, S,<br>\
K,) [such and such things were not;] and to two<br>\
persons لا بذى تَسْلَمَانِ, and to a pl. number<br>\
لا بذى تَسْلَمُونَ, and to a female لا بذى تَسْلَمِينَ,<br>\
and to a pl. number [of females] لا بذى تَسْلَمْنَ.<br>\
(ISk, S, K. *) And لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ بِذِى تَسْلَمُ, meaning, بِذِى سَلَامَتِكِ [i. e. I will not do that, by the<br>\
Author (lit. Lord or Master) of thy safety]; and<br>\
in like manner, بذى تَسْلَمَانِ, and بذى تَسْلَمُونَ.<br>\
(Sb, M. [See also ذو.]) And اِذْهَبْ بِذِى تَسْلَمُ,<br>\
i. e. اِذْهَبْ بِسَلَامَتِكَ [Go thou with thy safety;<br>\
or, with the Author of thy safety to protect thee;<br>\
meaning go thou in safety]; and [to two persons]<br>\
اِذْهَبَا بِذِى تَسْلَمَانِ. (S, K.) ذى is thus prefixed<br>\
to a verb [as virtually governing it in the gen.<br>\
case] like as آيَة is in an instance mentioned<br>\
under this latter word; but these are two extr.<br>\
instances; for only a noun significant of time is<br>\
[regularly] prefixed to a verb, as in the phrase<br>\
هٰذَا يَوْمُ يُفْعَلُ, meaning يُفْعَلُ فِيهِ: (Akh, S:) it<br>\
is not prefixed to any but this verb تَسْلَمُ [and its<br>\
variations as above mentioned]. (Sb, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And hence, (Mgh,) one says also, سَلِمَتْ لَهُ الضَّيْعَةُ,<br>\
meaning [The landed estate] was, or became, free<br>\
from participation to him; syn. خَلَصَت. (Mgh,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  سلمهُ, [app. سَلَمَهُ, or perhaps سَلِمَهُ, for<br>\
some verbs of this measure are trans., as حَسِبَ and<br>\
وَرِثَ,] inf. n. سلم, [app. سَلَمٌ, q. v. infrà,] He<br>\
made him a captive. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  سَلَمَتْهُ الحَيَّةُ,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. سَلْمٌ, (M, K, TA,) The serpent bit<br>\
him: (M, * K, * TA:) mentioned by Az, but he<br>\
adds that no one but Lth has said this. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-<br>\
سَلَمَ الجِلْدَ, aor.<br>\
سَلِمَ, (S, K,) inf. n. سَلْمٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He tanned the skin with [قَرَظ, i. e. leaves of] the<br>\
سَلَم [or mimosa flava]. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سَلَمَ<br>\
الدَّلْوَ, (M, K,) aor.<br>\
سَلِمَ, inf. n. سَلْمٌ, (M,) He<br>\
finished making the leathern bucket; and made<br>\
it firm, strong, or sound, or made it firmly,<br>\
strongly, or soundly. (M, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
سلّمهُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَسْلِيمٌ, (K,)<br>\
He (God) made him to be safe, secure, or free;<br>\
saved, secured, or freed, him; (M, Msb, TA;)<br>\
مِنَ الآفَاتِ [from evils of any kind], (S, Msb,)<br>\
or مِنَ الآفَةِ [from evil of any kind], (K,) or<br>\
مِنَ الأَمْرِ [from the affair]. (M.) [Freytag<br>\
assigns the same meaning to ↓ اسلمهُ also, as on<br>\
the authority of the Ham; in which I find no<br>\
explanation of this verb except one which will be<br>\
found later in this paragraph.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
التَّسْلِيمُ is also syn. with السَّلَامُ, (S, K, TA,) as<br>\
meaning The saluting, or greeting, one with a<br>\
prayer for his safety, or security, or freedom,<br>\
from evils of any kind in his religion and in his<br>\
person; and the interpretation thereof is [the<br>\
expressing a desire for] التَّخْلِيصٌ; (Mbr, TA;)<br>\
or the saluting, or greeting, one with a prayer<br>\
for his life; or, by saying سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ [q. v.<br>\
infrà, voce سَلَامٌ]; syn. التَّحِيَّةُ. (TA.) You say,<br>\
سَلَّمَ عَلَيْهِ [meaning He so saluted, or greeted,<br>\
him]. (M, Msb.) [This, when said of God, virtually means سَلَّمَهُ, i. e. He saved him; and<br>\
should be rendered agreeably with this explanation in the phrase commonly used after the mention of the Prophet, صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ May<br>\
God bless and save him. You say also, سَلَّمَ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
بِالخِلَافَةِ He saluted him with the acknowledgment of his being Khaleefeh; saying, سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ<br>\
يَا أَمِيرَ المُؤْمِنِينَ Salutation to thee, or peace be<br>\
on thee, &amp;c., O Prince of the Faithful.] التَّسْلِيمَةُ<br>\
signifies The salutation that is pronounced on<br>\
finishing every two rek&#39;ahs in prayer: (Har<br>\
p. 180:) [and also that which is pronounced after<br>\
the last rek&#39;ah of each of the prayers (i. e. after<br>\
the sunneh prayers and the fard alike), addressed<br>\
to the two guardian and recording angels: (see<br>\
my “ Modern Egyptians,” ch. iii., p. 78 of the<br>\
5th ed.:) and سَلَّمَ means He pronounced either<br>\
of those salutations.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] سلّم إِلَيْهِ<br>\
الشَّىْءَ, (S, K, *) inf. n. as above; (K;) and ↓ اسلم<br>\
اليه الشىءَ; (M;) He gave to him the thing;<br>\
(S, * M, K;) or delivered it to him: (M:) [he<br>\
resigned it to him:] and سلّم إِلَيْهِ الوَدِيعَةَ, (Mgh,)<br>\
or سلّم الوَدِيعَةَ لِصَاحِبِهَا, He delivered the deposit<br>\
[to him, or] to its owner: (Msb:) and ↓ اسلم<br>\
الثَّوْبَ إِلَى الخَيَّاطِ (Mgh) signifies the same as<br>\
سلّمهُ إِلَيْهِ [i. e. He delivered the garment, or<br>\
piece of cloth, to the tailor]. (Har p. 166.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
See also 4, in two places. ―<br>\
-b5-  You say also, سلّم<br>\
الأَجِيرُ نَفْسَهُ لِلْمُسْتَأْجِرِ The hired man gave himself<br>\
up, or gave authority over himself, to the hirer.<br>\
(Msb.) And ↓ أَسْلَمْتُهُ and سَلَّمْتُهُ I left him in<br>\
the power of him who desired to kill him or to<br>\
wound him. (Ham p. 115.) And لِلْهَلَكَةِ ↓ اسلمهُ<br>\
[He gave him up to destruction]: in this case<br>\
with [the prep.] ل only. (Har p. 166.) And<br>\
الرَّجُلَ ↓ اسلم, (S, * M, Msb, *) or العَدُوَّ, (K,) He<br>\
left, forsook, or deserted, (M, K,) the man, (S, *<br>\
M, Msb, *) or the enemy; (K;) or abstained from<br>\
aiding, or assisting, him; (S, M, Msb, K;) and<br>\
threw him into destruction. (IAth, TA.) And<br>\
لِمَا بِهِ ↓ اسلمهُ He left him [to that bane which<br>\
was in him: app. referring to the bite of a serpent, or any evil affection: see سَلِيمٌ, third sentence]. (S, * M.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And سلّم أَمْرَهُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ and<br>\
↓ اسلمهُ, both meaning the same, (S, Msb, K,<br>\
TA,) i. e. He committed his case to God. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  And سلّم الدَّعْوَى He acknowledged the truth<br>\
[or justice] of the claim, demand, or suit; [he<br>\
conceded its truth or justice;] from سلّم الوَدِيعَةَ<br>\
لِصَاحِبِهَا, expl. above; denoting an ideal delivering<br>\
[or yielding of a thing to another person]. (Msb.)<br>\
[Hence one says, سلّم أَنَّهُ كَذَا He conceded that<br>\
it was thus.] ―<br>\
-b8-  And التَّسْلِيمُ signifies also [The<br>\
assenting, or] the giving [one&#39;s] approval (S, K,<br>\
TA) unreservedly, (S,) to that which is ordained,<br>\
or decreed, (S, K, TA,) by God; and the submitting to his commands; and the abstaining from<br>\
offering opposition in the case in which it is not<br>\
becoming [to do so]. (TA.) You say, سلّم لِأَمْرِ<br>\
اللّٰهِ He assented to the command of God: [or he<br>\
gave his approval to it:] or he submitted to it;<br>\
as also ↓ اسلم. (MA.)<br>\
3<br>\
سالمهُ, (M, Msb,) inf. n. مُسَالَمَةٌ (S, M, Msb)<br>\
and سِلَامٌ, (M, Msb,) He made peace, or became<br>\
at peace or reconciled, with him; or he reconciled<br>\
himself with him: [implying mutual concession,<br>\
or a compromise:] (S, * M, Msb:) and سَالَمَا<br>\
They made peace, or became at peace or reconciled, or they reconciled themselves, each with the<br>\
other. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَسْلَمَ see 2, in nine places. [The first of the<br>\
meanings there assigned to this verb is, in my<br>\
opinion, more than doubtful. In all its senses, it<br>\
seems to be properly trans.: when it is used as<br>\
an intrans. verb, an objective complement is app.<br>\
understood. Thus,] أَسْلَمَ is syn. with أَسْلَفَ [as<br>\
meaning He paid in advance, or beforehand];<br>\
(S, M, Mgh, Msb;) الثَّمَنَ [the price] being suppressed, though sometimes it is expressed; (Mgh;)<br>\
as also ↓ سلّم; (M;) and ↓ تسلّم, as occurring in<br>\
a trad., where it is said, مَنْ تَسَلَّمَ فِى شَىْءٍ فَلَا<br>\
يَصْرِفُهُ إِلَى غَيْرِهِ [Whoso pays in advance for a<br>\
thing, he shall not turn it over, or transfer it, to<br>\
another than him]; but Kt says that he had not<br>\
heard this verb thus used except in this instance.<br>\
(TA.) So the first of these verbs signifies in the<br>\
saying, اسلم فِى الطَّعَامِ (S) or فى البُرِّ (Mgh)<br>\
[He paid in advance for the wheat], and فى<br>\
الشَّىْءِ [for the thing], as also ↓ سلّم. (M.) And<br>\
hence the saying, إِذَا أَسْلَمَ صُوفًا فِى لِبْدٍ أَوْ شَعَرًا فِى<br>\
مِسْحٍ لَمْ يَجُزْ [If he give in advance wool for felt,<br>\
or goats&#39; hair for a garment, or piece, of haircloth, it will not be allowable]. (Mgh.) And so<br>\
in the phrase, أَسْلَمْتُ إِلَيْهِ [I paid in advance to<br>\
him]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also [He resigned, or submitted, himself; نَفْسَهُ being understood: or] he<br>\
was, or became, resigned, or submissive; (M, K;)<br>\
and so ↓ استسلم: (S, M, Msb, K:) you say, اسلم<br>\
لِلّٰهِ [He resigned, or submitted, himself, or he was,<br>\
or became, resigned, or submissive, to God: see<br>\
also an ex. (before referred to) in the last sentence of the second paragraph: or he was, or<br>\
became, sincere in his religion, or without hypocrisy, towards God: see مُسْلِمٌ]: (Msb:) [or]<br>\
اسلم signifies he entered into السِّلْم, (S, Msb,)<br>\
which here means الاِسْتِسْلَام [i. e. the state of<br>\
resignation, or submission]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He<br>\
became a Muslim; as also ↓ تسلّم; (M, * K;) as<br>\
in the saying, كَانَ كَافِرًا ثُمَّ تَسَلَّمَ, i. e. أَسْلَمَ [He<br>\
was an unbeliever, or a denier of the unity of<br>\
God, &amp;c.; then he became a Muslim]: (M:) or<br>\
he entered [the pale, or communion, of] the religion of الإِسْلَام. (S, * Msb.) الإِسْلَامُ as a principle of the law of God is The manifesting of<br>\
humility or submission, and outward conforming<br>\
with the law of God, and the taking upon oneself<br>\
to do or to say as the Prophet has done or said:<br>\
for this, the blood is to be spared, and one may<br>\
demand the repelling of evil: (T, * M:) and if<br>\
there is therewith firm belief with the heart, it is<br>\
إِيمَانٌ: (T:) this is the doctrine of Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee;<br>\
but the doctrine of Aboo-Haneefeh makes no<br>\
difference between these two terms: (KT:)<br>\
[agreeably with the former doctrine,] Th well<br>\
and briefly says, الاسلام is with the tongue, and<br>\
الايمان is with the heart: and he says, in explaining verse 48 of ch. v. of the Kur, that every<br>\
prophet has been sent with الاسلام, though the<br>\
ordinances differ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  One says also, أَسْلَمْتُ<br>\
عَنْهُ, meaning I left it [app. an affair, as in an<br>\
explanation in the TK,] after I had been [engaged] in it. (Ibn-Buzurj, K.) And اسلم occurs<br>\
intransitively in the saying, كَانَ رَاعِىَ غَنَمٍ ثُمَّ<br>\
أَسْلَمَ, meaning [He was a pastor of sheep, or<br>\
goats; then] he left them. (M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Freytag<br>\
assigns to اسلم another signification “ Adscendere<br>\
fecit (vid. a سُلَّم),” as from the Ham, p. 39: but<br>\
this is app. a mistake, into which he has been led<br>\
by a saying, there cited, of Zuheyr, which I read<br>\
thus:<br>\
هَوِىَّ الدَّلْوِ أَسْلَمَهَا الرِّشَآءُ<br>\
(meaning, The descent, or as the descent, of the<br>\
bucket that the well-rope has let go): and by its<br>\
being there said that “ you should not prefer any<br>\
reading of هوى to that with damm, though it<br>\
has been said otherwise: ” whereas the correct<br>\
reading is, in my opinion, هَوِىّ, agreeably with<br>\
what here follows:] Er-Riyáshee says, on the<br>\
authority of AZ, that الهَوِىُّ, with fet-h, is downwards; and with damm, upwards; and he cites<br>\
the saying above as an ex. of the word as meaning downwards. (TA in art. هوى.)<br>\
5<br>\
تسلّم مِنْهُ He asserted, or declared, himself<br>\
to be free from, or clear of, or quit of, it, or<br>\
him. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تسلّم is also syn. with أُسْلَمَ, in two<br>\
senses: see the latter, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  And<br>\
تسلّمهُ signifies He took it, or received it; namely,<br>\
a thing given, or delivered. (S, M, Msb, K.)<br>\
6<br>\
تسالموا, (M,) and تسالما, (K,) inf. n. تَسَالُمٌ,<br>\
(S,) They, (M,) or they two, (K,) made peace,<br>\
or became at peace or reconciled, (S, * M, K,)<br>\
one with another, (S, M,) or each with the other.<br>\
(S, K.) [See also 8.] ―<br>\
-b2-  One says of a man,<br>\
(M,) of a great, or frequent, liar, (TA,) لَا تَسَالَمُ<br>\
خَيْلَاهُ, [for تَتَسَالَمُ,] (M,) or لَا يَتَسَالَمُ خَيْلَاهُ, (K,<br>\
TA,) [(assumed tropical:)  His two troops of horses will not agree<br>\
in pace, each with the other;] meaning (tropical:)  [his<br>\
assertions will not be found to agree together; or]<br>\
he will not say what is true, so that it may be<br>\
accepted from him: for تَسَالَمَتْ, said of horses,<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  they kept pace, one with another;<br>\
(تَسَايَرَتْ [q. v.];) not exciting one another. (M,<br>\
K, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
استلم He became at peace, or reconciled.<br>\
(TA.) Hence the saying, (TA,) هُوَ لَا يَسْتَلَمُ عَلَى<br>\
سَخَطِهِ He will not become at peace, or reconciled,<br>\
during his displeasure at a thing. (K, TA.) [See<br>\
also 6.] ―<br>\
-b2-  استلم الزَّرْعُ The seed-produce put<br>\
forth its ears. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  استلم الحَجَرَ He touched,<br>\
(S, K,) or reached, (Mgh,) the stone, [meaning<br>\
the Black Stone of the Kaabeh,] by kissing, or<br>\
with the hand: (S, Mgh, K:) or he wiped it, or<br>\
stroked it, with the hand: (Mgh:) or he kissed<br>\
the stone: or he embraced it: (M:) and اِسْتَلْأَمَهُ<br>\
signifies the same; (M, K;) but is not the original:<br>\
(M:) accord. to ISk, the Arabs pronounced it<br>\
with hemz, contr. to analogy; (Msb;) or it<br>\
should not be pronounced with hemz, though<br>\
some thus pronounce it, (S,) the original being<br>\
استلم, (ISk, Msb,) because it is from سِلَامٌ [pl.<br>\
of سَلِمَةٌ] signifying “ stones,” (ISk, S, * M, Msb, *<br>\
[in the Mgh, from سَلِمَةٌ signifying “ a stone,”<br>\
and in the Msb the pl. of سَلِمَةٌ is said to be سَلَامٌ,<br>\
like كَلَامٌ,]) accord. to Sb, who says that it does<br>\
not denote the act of taking; (M;) or, accord. to<br>\
Sb, it is from السَّلَامُ, with fet-h, meaning “ salutation,” and it means the touching with the<br>\
hand by way of salutation in order to obtain a<br>\
blessing thereby: (TA:) but accord. to IAar, the<br>\
original is with hemz, from المُلَآءَمَةُ, meaning<br>\
الاِجْتِمَاعُ [“ the coming together,” &amp;c., because<br>\
denoting contact]. (Msb.) Abu-t-Tufeyl is related to have said, رَأَيْتُ رَسُولَ اللّٰهِ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
وَسَلَّمَ يَطُوفُ عَلَى رَاحِلَتِهِ يَسْتَلِمُ بِمِحْجَنِهِ وَيُقَبِّلُ<br>\
المِحْجَنَ [i. e. I saw the Apostle of God (may<br>\
God bless and save him) circuiting around the<br>\
Kaabeh, upon his camel, touching the Black Stone<br>\
with his hooked staff, and kissing the hooked staff].<br>\
(TA.) The primary signification of الاِسْتِلَامُ is<br>\
[said to be] The wiping, or stroking, the سَلِمَة,<br>\
i. e. the stone: afterwards it was used in relation<br>\
to other things, and one said اِسْتَلَمْتُ يَدَهَا, meaning I stroked, or kissed, her hand. (Har pp. 30<br>\
and 31.) ―<br>\
-b2-  استلم الخُفُّ قَدَمَيْهِ means The boot<br>\
rendered his feet soft [after he had been accustomed to walking barefoot]. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَسْلَمَ see 4, in the former half of the paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  استسلم ثَكَمَ الطَّرِيقِ He went upon the middle<br>\
of the road, not missing it. (K, * TA. [In the<br>\
CK, after واسْتَسْلَمَ انقادَ, for وثَكَمَ الطَّرِيقِ, meaning<br>\
واستسلم ثَكَمَ الطَّرِيقِ, is erroneously put وتَسَلَّمَ<br>\
الطَّرِيقَ, assigning to تسلّم a meaning belonging<br>\
to استسلم.])<br>\
Q. Q. 2<br>\
تَمَسْلَمَ [from مُسْلِمٌ] He named, or<br>\
called, himself a Muslim; or he named himself<br>\
Muslim; his name having before been Mohammad: (M, K:) mentioned by Er-Ru-ásee. (M.)<br>\
سَلْمٌ: see the next paragraph, in six places.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also A leathern bucket (دَلْوٌ) having one عُرْوَة [or<br>\
loop-shaped handle], (T, S, M, K,) with which<br>\
the waterer walks, like the buckets (دِلَآء) of the<br>\
attendants of the camels or other beasts upon<br>\
which water is drawn or which carry water, (T,<br>\
TA,) or like the دَلْو of the water-carriers: (S,<br>\
K:) expl. in the S as above as on the authority of<br>\
AA; but IB says that the correct explanation is,<br>\
having one عَرْقُوَة [or stick fixed across from one<br>\
part of the brim to the to the opposite part, serving as<br>\
a handle as well as to keep it from collapsing]:<br>\
(TA:) of the masc. gender [whereas دَلْوٌ is fem.]:<br>\
(M:) pl. [of pauc.] أَسْلُمٌ and [of mult.] سِلَامٌ,<br>\
(M, K,) and Lh mentions as its pl. أَسَالِمُ, which<br>\
is extr. [unless as a pl. pl., i. e. pl. of أَسْلُمٌ]. (M.)<br>\
سِلْمٌ Peace, or reconciliation; as also ↓ سَلْمٌ;<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K;) masc. and fem.; (S, Msb, K; *)<br>\
and ↓ سَلَمٌ and ↓ سَلَامٌ are like سِلْمٌ [in signification]: (M: [the context there shows that the<br>\
signification mentioned above is what is meant in<br>\
this instance:]) or سِلْمٌ signifies the making peace,<br>\
or becoming at peace or reconciled, with another<br>\
or others; (Ham p. 80;) as also ↓ سَلْمٌ; and both<br>\
are sometimes fem. as being syn. with مُصَالَحَةٌ.<br>\
(L voce جَنَحَ, q. v.) In the saying of El-Aashà,<br>\
أَذَاقَتْهُمُ الحَرْبُ أَنْفَاسَهَا<br>\
↓ وَقَدْ تُكْرَهُ الحَرْبُ بَعْدَ السِّلِمْ<br>\
[War made them, or has made them, to taste its<br>\
draughts, and verily war is disliked after peace],<br>\
he has transferred the vowel of the م to the ل, in<br>\
pausing; or it may be that he has inserted a<br>\
kesreh in imitation of the preceding kesreh: it is<br>\
not an instance like إِبِل, in the opinion of Sb;<br>\
for in his opinion the latter is the only instance of<br>\
its kind. (M.) It is said in a trad., respecting<br>\
El-Hodeybiyeh, أَخَذَ ثَمَانِينَ مِنْ أَهْلِ مَكَّةَ سِلْمًا,<br>\
or ↓ سَلْمًا, or ↓ سَلَمًا, accord. to different relations,<br>\
meaning [He took forty of the people of Mekkeh]<br>\
peaceably: thus expl. by El-Homeydee, in his<br>\
“ Ghareeb. ” (TA. [See also سَلَمٌ below.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also i. q. ↓ سَلَامٌ, (S, K, TA,) as signifying Selfresignation, or submission; (TA; [and thus the<br>\
latter is expl. in one place in the S;]) which is<br>\
also a signification of ↓ سَلَمٌ: (S, M, K, TA:) and<br>\
this is meant in the Kur [iv. 96], where it is said,<br>\
لَسْتَ مُؤْمِنًا ↓ وَلَا تَقُولُوا لِمَنْ أَلْقَى إِلَيْكُمُ السَّلَامَ, (Bd,<br>\
TA,) or ↓ السَّلَمَ, as some read, (Bd,) [i. e. And<br>\
say not ye to him who offers to you submission,<br>\
Thou art not a believer:] or ↓ السَّلَامَ here means<br>\
the salutation of الإِسْلَام [by saying سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ]:<br>\
(Bd, TA: *) or salutation, and submission by<br>\
uttering the profession of الإِسْلَام; and so ↓ السَّلَمَ:<br>\
(Jel:) [or the latter here means, simply, salutation; and this is app. what is meant by its being<br>\
said that] السَّلَمُ is the subst. from التَّسْلِيمُ; (K;)<br>\
[but accord. to SM,] this means the unreserved<br>\
approval of what is decreed; and this is said to<br>\
be meant by the reading السَّلَمَ mentioned above.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence] السِّلْمُ signifies also الإِسْلَامُ<br>\
[as meaning The religion of the Muslims; because it is a religion of self-resignation, or submission]: (S, K:) this is meant in the Kur<br>\
[ii. 204], where it is said, اُدْخُلُوا فِى السِّلْمِ كَافَّةً<br>\
[Enter ye into the religion of El-Islám wholly];<br>\
(S, Bd, Jel;) and so ↓ السَّلْمِ, as some there read;<br>\
(Bd, Jel;) or both there mean submission and<br>\
obedience to God: (Bd:) [and] ↓ السَّلَمُ [also] has<br>\
the former meaning. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (S, M, K,)<br>\
and ↓ سَلْمٌ, (M,) A man, (S, K, TA,) [and] a<br>\
woman, (M,) who makes peace, or is at peace,<br>\
with another; (S, M, K;) and in like manner, a<br>\
company of men (قَوْمٌ). (M.) This is said to be<br>\
meant in the Kur [xxxix. 30], where it is said,<br>\
وَرَجْلًا سِلْمًا لِرَجُلٍ, as some read, i. e. And a man<br>\
who is at peace with respect to a man: (TA:) or<br>\
سِلْمًا and ↓ سَلْمًا and ↓ سَلَمًا, three different readings, in the place of [the more common reading]<br>\
سَالِمًا, are all inf. ns. of سَلِمَ, used as epithets [syn.<br>\
with سَالِمًا], or ذَا is suppressed before them.<br>\
(Bd.) You say, أَنَا سِلْمٌ لِمَنْ سَالَمَنِى [I am one<br>\
who is at peace with respect to him who is at<br>\
peace with me]. (S, TA.) And a poet says,<br>\
[using this word in two different senses, the latter<br>\
of which has been mentioned above,]<br>\
لِأَهْلِكِ فَاقْبَلِى سِلْمِى  أَنَائِلُ إِنَّنِى سِلْمٌ<br>\
[O Náïleh, (نَائِلُ being for نَائِلَةٌ, a woman&#39;s<br>\
name, apocopated,) verily I am one who is at<br>\
peace with respect to thy family, therefore accept<br>\
thou my submission]. (TA. [It seems to be<br>\
there indicated by the context that سلمى here<br>\
means my peace, or reconciliation; which is less<br>\
appropriate than the meaning that I have assigned<br>\
to it.])<br>\
سَلَمٌ: see سَلَامٌ: and see also سِلْمٌ, in seven<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, in buying or selling, (Msb,) the<br>\
subst. from أَسْلَمَ فِى الشَّىْءِ and سَلَّمَ signifying<br>\
أَسْلَفَ, (M,) i. q. سَلَفٌ; (S, Msb, K;) i. e. Any<br>\
money, or property, paid in advance, or beforehand, as the price of a commodity for which<br>\
the seller has become responsible and which one<br>\
has bought on description: (T and TA in art.<br>\
سلف:) or payment for a commodity to be delivered at a certain [future] period with something additional to [the equivalent of] the current<br>\
price at the time of such payment; this [transaction] being a cause of profit to him who makes<br>\
such payment: (TA in that art.:) or a sort of<br>\
sale in which the price is paid in advance, and<br>\
the commodity is withheld, on the condition of<br>\
description, to a certain [future] period: (S and<br>\
O in that art., in explanation of سَلَفٌ:) but it is<br>\
said in a trad. that the term سَلَمٌ as meaning سَلَفٌ<br>\
was disliked; app. because the former is applied<br>\
to obedience, and self-resignation, or submission,<br>\
to God. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And The making [one] captive. (K. [See 1, in the latter part of the paragraph.])<br>\
-A3-  And A captive; (K;) because he<br>\
submits himself. (TA.) One says, أَخَذَهُ سَلَمًا,<br>\
(M, TA, [in the TK بِالسَّلَمِ,]) He took him [a<br>\
captive], (TA,) or made him captive, (M,) without war: (M, TA:) or he brought him in a state<br>\
of submission, not resisting; and so, if wounded:<br>\
(IAar, M, TA:) and thus El-Khattábee has expl.<br>\
the phrase in the trad. respecting El-Hodeybiyeh<br>\
cited above, voce سِلْمٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  Also A sort of<br>\
tree, (S, M, Msb, K,) [the mimosa flava of Forskål,<br>\
who writes its Arabic name in Italic characters<br>\
syllæm, and in Arabic characters سليم, (Flora<br>\
Aegypt. Arab., p. cxxiii.,)] a species (M) of the<br>\
[kind of thorny trees called] عِضَاه, (S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA, [not غَضَاة, as in the Lexicons of Golius<br>\
and Freytag,]) the leaves whereof are the قَرَظ,<br>\
with which skin is tanned: (TA:) AHn says, its<br>\
branches are long, like rods; and it has no wood<br>\
such as is used in carpentry, even if it grows<br>\
large: it has slender, long thorns, grievous when<br>\
they wound the foot of a man; and a yellow<br>\
[fruit such as is termed] بَرَمَة [n. un. of بَرَمٌ, see<br>\
this word, and see also حُبْلَةٌ,] which is the sweetest of the بَرَم in odour; and they tan with its<br>\
leaves: and it is said, on the authority of the<br>\
Arabs of the desert, that it has a yellow flower,<br>\
containing a green grain (حَبَّة خَضْرَآء [or this<br>\
may mean a grain of a dark, or an ashy, dustcolour]), of sweet odour, in which is somewhat of<br>\
bitterness, and of which the gazelles are very<br>\
fond: (M:) the n. un. is with ة: (S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K:) and pl. أَسْلَامٌ, (M,) and سِلَامٌ is said by<br>\
IB to be pl. of the n. un., like as إِكَامٌ is of أَكَمَةٌ.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence,] ذَاتُ أَسْلَامٍ A land (أَرْض) that<br>\
gives growth to the [trees called] سَلَم. (K.) See<br>\
also سلَمَان.<br>\
سَلِمٌ Stones; (S, M;) as also ↓ سِلَامٌ: (M:) and<br>\
↓ سَلِمَةٌ [as n. un. of the former and sing. of the<br>\
latter, (incorrectly written by Freytag, in one<br>\
place, سَلَمَةٌ, and incorrectly said by him to be of<br>\
the dial. of the people of Himyer,)] signifies a<br>\
stone: (S, M, Mgh, Msb:) [or] the pl. [or quasipl. n.] of سَلِمَةٌ in this sense is ↓ سَلَامٌ, like كَلَامٌ<br>\
in measure: (Msb:) or ↓ سَلِمَةٌ signifies stones;<br>\
(K;) or hard stones; (TA;) and ↓ سِلَامٌ is its pl.:<br>\
(K:) [said to be] so called because of their freedom (سلَامَة) from softness: (TA:) or this last<br>\
signifies stones, the small thereof and the large;<br>\
and they assign to it no sing.: (ISh, TA:) or<br>\
سلام [probably meaning ↓ سَلَامٌ] is a quasi-pl. n.:<br>\
(Aboo-Kheyreh, TA:) and it is also said to be a<br>\
name for any broad stone. (TA.) See also<br>\
سَلَمَان. A poet says, (namely, Bujeyr Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Anameh, IB, TA,)<br>\
يَرْمِى وَرَائِى بِامْسَهْكِ وَامْسَهْمِ وَامْسَلِمَهْ<br>\
[He casts from behind me (i. e. defends me) with<br>\
the arrow and the stone]: this [usage of ام for ال]<br>\
is of the dial. of [Teiyi and] Himyer. (S, TA.)<br>\
السِّلِمْ for السِّلْمْ: see سِلْمٌ, second sentence.<br>\
سَلِمَةٌ: see سَلِمٌ, in two places: and سَلَمَان.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also A woman soft, or tender, in the أَطْرَاف [or<br>\
fingers, or other extremities]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And An<br>\
old and weak she-camel. (IAar, TA in art. سد.)<br>\
سَلْمَى A certain plant (K, TA) which becomes<br>\
green in the [season called] صَيْف [app. here<br>\
meaning spring]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَبُو سَلْمَى The [species<br>\
of lizard called] وَزَغ: (K:) or, some say, [as<br>\
is said in the M,] ↓ أَبُو سَلْمَانَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See<br>\
also the next paragraph. ―<br>\
-b4-  [In the CK, by a<br>\
mistranscription, a meaning belonging to سُلَامَى<br>\
is assigned to سَلْمَى.]<br>\
السَّلْمَآء, accord. to Aboo-Mis-hal, as meaning<br>\
The earth, occurs in the prov., أَنْفٌ قِى المَآءِ وَاسْتٌ<br>\
فِى السَّلْمَآءِ [A nose in the water and a rump on<br>\
the earth]: and if this be correct, it may be<br>\
derived from سلام [i. e. سِلَامٌ] meaning “ stones: ”<br>\
and it may be originally ↓ السَّلْمَى, and lengthened<br>\
for the sake of the rhyme. (Ham p. 214.) [But<br>\
the reading commonly known is, أَنْفٌ فِى السَّلْمَآءِ<br>\
وَاسْتٌ فِى المَآءِ.]<br>\
هُوَ سَلْمَانُ بَيْتِهِ He is the special, or particular,<br>\
friend of his [another&#39;s] house; one who mixes<br>\
with him much: from the saying of the Prophet,<br>\
سَلْمَانُ مِنَّا أَهْلِ البَيْتِ [Selmán is of us, the people<br>\
of the house]; referring to Selmán El-Fárisee.<br>\
(Har p. 472.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَبُو سَلْمَانَ: see سَلْمَى. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
A species of the [black beetles called] جِعْلَان [pl.<br>\
of جُعَلٌ, q. v.]: (M:) or i. q. جُعَلٌ, (IAar, K,)<br>\
or أَبُو جَعْرَان, with fet-h [app. a mistake for kesr]<br>\
to the ج: (Kr, TA:) or the largest of the<br>\
جِعْلَان: or a certain insect like the جُعَل, having<br>\
a pair of wings: (TA:) or the male of the [black<br>\
beetles called] خَنَافِس [pl. of خُنْفَسَآءُ, q. v.].<br>\
(IAar, TA in art. فرض.)<br>\
سَلَمَان or سَلِمَان, accord. to different readings,<br>\
occurs in a trad. of Ibn-&#39;Omar, in which it is<br>\
said, كَانَ يُصَلِّى عِنْدَ سَلَمَانٍ فِى طَرِيقِ مَكَّةَ [He<br>\
used to pray at certain selem-trees, or certain<br>\
stones, in the road of Mekkeh]: each may be a<br>\
pl. [or rather a quasi-pl. n.]; the former, of<br>\
↓ سَلَمَةٌ, the “ tree so called; ” the latter, of ↓ سَلِمَةٌ,<br>\
“ stones ” [or a “ stone: ” but both of these explanations are strange]. (TA.)<br>\
سَلَامٌ, (S, K, TA,) in its primary acceptation,<br>\
(TA,) is syn. with ↓ سَلَامَةٌ, (S, K, TA,) as is also<br>\
↓ سَلَمٌ, (S, [so in one of my copies, but omitted in<br>\
the other copy,]) and signifies Safety, security,<br>\
immunity, or freedom, from faults, defects, imperfections, blemishes, or vices, (S, * [mentioned<br>\
in one only of my two copies, and there as<br>\
relating peculiarly to the third word,] K, [in<br>\
which it ostensibly relates peculiarly to the first<br>\
word, but in the CK, by the omission of a و before<br>\
it, it is made to relate only to the second word,]<br>\
and TA, [accord. to which it relates to the first<br>\
and second words, as it is well known to do,]) and<br>\
from evils of any kind: (TA:) or [simply]<br>\
safety, security, immunity, or freedom; as also<br>\
↓ سَلَامَةٌ: (Sb, M:) IKt says that these two<br>\
words may be dial. vars. [syn. each with the<br>\
other]; or the former may be pl. of the latter [or<br>\
rather a coll. gen. n. of which the latter is the<br>\
n. un.]: (M, TA:) and Suh says, in the R, that<br>\
most of the lexicologists hold them to have one<br>\
[and the same] meaning: but that if they considered the language of the Arabs, and the distinction, or limitation, denoted by the ة, they<br>\
would see that between them is a great difference<br>\
[inasmuch as the former has a large range of<br>\
meaning which the latter has not, as will be seen<br>\
from what follows]. (TA.) سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ is an<br>\
announcement of the continuance of سَلَامَة [or<br>\
safety, &amp;c.]: (Bd in xiii. 24:) [it may therefore<br>\
be rendered Safety, &amp;c., be, or light and abide,<br>\
on you; or, generally, peace be, or light and<br>\
abide, on you; for] it means nothing disliked, or<br>\
evil, shall befall you henceforth: (Bd in xvi. 34:)<br>\
and سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ [may be rendered in like manner;<br>\
for it virtually] means I will not do to thee anything that is disliked, or evil; (Bd and Jel in<br>\
xix. 48;) nor say to thee henceforward what<br>\
would annoy thee, or be disagreeable, or evil, to<br>\
thee. (Bd ibid.) It may also be [rendered May<br>\
safety, &amp;c., or peace, be, or light and abide, on<br>\
you; as] a prayer for سَلَامَة, to those to whom it<br>\
is addressed, from the state in which they are at<br>\
the time. (Bd in xxviii. 55.) [It is generally<br>\
held that this salutation may not be used by, nor<br>\
to, any but a Muslim.] In the beginning of an<br>\
epistle, the approved practice is to write سَلَامٌ<br>\
عَلَيْكَ, without the article ال; and in repeating<br>\
it, at the end, to write it with that article.<br>\
(Durrat el-Ghowwás, in De Sacy&#39;s Anthol.<br>\
Gramm. Arabe, p. 72 of the Arabic text. [In<br>\
the latter case, the general practice in the present<br>\
day is to write simply وَالسَّلَام, suppressing عَلَيْكَ.])<br>\
In saluting the dead, one puts عَلَيْكَ first, saying,<br>\
عَلَيْكَ سَلَامُ اللّٰهِ. (Ham p. 367.) You also say,<br>\
مَا كَانَ كَذَا وَكَذَا ↓ لَا بِسَلَامَتِكَ [No, by thy<br>\
safety, such and such things were not]. (S.)<br>\
السُّلَامُ is also a name of God, (S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
[applied to Him in the Kur lix. 23, accord. to<br>\
some for ذُو السَّلَامِ, i. e. ذُو السَّلَامَةِ,] because of<br>\
his safety, or freedom, from defect, and imperfection, and cessation of existence; (IKt, M, TA;)<br>\
or from variations, and as being the everlasting,<br>\
who brings the creation to nought and will not<br>\
come to nought; or, accord. to Suh in the R, He<br>\
is so named [as being the Author of Safety,<br>\
Security, &amp;c.; i. e.] because He has rendered all<br>\
his creatures safe, or free, from defectiveness, or<br>\
unsoundness, and mankind and the jinn, or genii,<br>\
from the betiding of injustice, or wrong, to them,<br>\
from Him; and the expositors who assert that<br>\
He is thus named because of his safety, or<br>\
freedom, from imperfections, and evils of any<br>\
kind, utter an unseemly saying, making سَلَامٌ to<br>\
be syn. with ↓ سَالِمٌ, which latter applies only to<br>\
him who is liable to evil of any kind, and who<br>\
expects it, and then becomes safe, or free, from it.<br>\
(TA.) دَارُ السَّلَامِ is an appellation of Paradise,<br>\
(M, K,) [applied thereto in the Kur vi. 127 and<br>\
x. 26,] as being the abode of everlasting safety,<br>\
or security; (Zj, M, TA;) the abode of safety, or<br>\
security, from evils of any kind, from death and<br>\
decrepitude and diseases [&amp;c.]: (TA:) or as<br>\
being the abode of God. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
سِلْمٌ, in four places. ―<br>\
-b3-  [As is there stated,] it<br>\
signifies also Salutation, or greeting; (M, TA;)<br>\
particularly the salutation of الإِسْلَام [by saying<br>\
سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكَ or سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ, expl. above]; (Bd in<br>\
iv. 96;) a subst. (S, Mgh, Msb, TA) from سَلَّمَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ, (Msb,) [i. e.] from التُّسْلِيمُ, (S, Mgh, TA,)<br>\
like كَلَامٌ from التَّكْلِيمُ. (Mgh. [See 2, third<br>\
sentence.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  In the saying in the Kur [xxv. 64],<br>\
وَإِذَا خَاطَبَهُمُ الْجَاهِلُونَ قَالُوا سَلَامًا [And when the<br>\
ignorant speak to them, they say, سَلَامًا], this last<br>\
word signifies تَسَلُّمًا, (Sb, M,) or تَسَلُّمًا مِنْكُمْ [for<br>\
نَتَسَلَّمُ مِنْكُمْ تَسَلُّمًا We declare ourselves to be<br>\
clear, or quit, of you], and مُتَارَكَهً لَلُمْ [for<br>\
نُتَارِكُكُمْ مُتَارَكَةً we relinquish you], (Bd,) [and<br>\
means] there shall be neither good nor evil<br>\
between us (Sb, M, Bd) and you: it is not the<br>\
سلام that is used in salutation; for the verse was<br>\
revealed at Mekkeh, and the Muslims had not<br>\
then been commanded to salute the believers in<br>\
a plurality of gods: (Sb, M:) [in iv. 88 of the<br>\
Kur, which was promulgated afterwards, at ElMedeeneh, is a general command to return a<br>\
salutation with a better or with the same; but<br>\
the Sunneh prescribes that the salutation of سَلَامٌ<br>\
عَلَيْكَ or سَلَامٌ عَلَيْكُمْ when addressed to a Muslim<br>\
by one not a Muslim is to be returned only by<br>\
saying وَعَلَيْكَ or وَعَلَيْكُمْ:] or the meaning in<br>\
xxv. 64 is, they say a right saying, in which they<br>\
are secure from harming and sinning. (Bd.)<br>\
Sb asserts that Aboo-Rabee&#39;ah used to say, إِذَا لَقِيتَ<br>\
فُلَانًا فَقُلْ سَلَامًا, meaning تَسَلُّمًا [for أَتَسَلَّمُ مِنْكَ<br>\
تَسَلُّمًا, i. e. When thou meetest such a one, say,<br>\
I declare myself to be clear, or quit, of thee]:<br>\
and he says that some of them said سَلَامٌ,<br>\
meaning The case of me and thee is the [case of]<br>\
being clear, or quit, each of the other; and the [case<br>\
of] mutual relinquishing. (M.) [It is usual, in the<br>\
present day, to say, اِفْعَلْ كَذَا وَالسَّلَام, meaning<br>\
Do thou such a thing, and there will be an end<br>\
of altercation between us.]<br>\
-A2-  See also سَلِيمٌ.<br>\
-A3-<br>\
Also A kind of trees; (S, M, Msb, K;) they<br>\
assert that they are evergreen; nothing eats<br>\
them; but the gazelles keep to them, and protect<br>\
themselves by their shade, but do not hide among<br>\
them; and they are not great trees, nor of the<br>\
kind called عِضَاه: (AHn, M:) they are also<br>\
called ↓ سِلَامٌ; (K;) or this is pl. of سَلَمَةٌ [n. un.<br>\
of سَلَمٌ], which is of another kind; like as إِكَامٌ<br>\
is pl. of أَكَمَةٌ: (IB, TA:) n. un. with ة. (S, M.)<br>\
السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ was said to an Arab of the desert;<br>\
and he replied, الجَثْجَاثُ عَلَيْكَ: and being asked,<br>\
“ What is this reply? ” he answered, “They are<br>\
two bitter trees: thou hast put upon me one, so<br>\
I have put upon thee the other. ” (K.)<br>\
-A4-  See<br>\
also سَلِمٌ, in two places.<br>\
سِلَامٌ: see سَلِمٌ, in two places:<br>\
-A2-  and the paragraph here next preceding, last sentence but two.<br>\
سَلِيمٌ i. q. ↓ سَالِمٌ, (S, M, K,) which means Safe,<br>\
secure, or free, (Msb,) from evils of any kind;<br>\
(K, Msb, TA;) applied to a man: (M:) pl.<br>\
سُلَمَآءُ; (M, K, TA;) in some copies of the K<br>\
سَلْمَى, like جَرْحَى pl. of جَرِيحٌ; (TA;) [but<br>\
this is probably its pl. only when it is used in the<br>\
sense of جَرِيحٌ or the like, as seems to be the case<br>\
from what follows.] Also, (M,) applied to a<br>\
heart: (S, M:) بِقَلْبٍ سَلِيمٍ, in the Kur xxvi. 89,<br>\
means With a heart free from unbelief: (M,<br>\
TA:) or, divested of corruptness, or unsoundness: (Er-Rághib, TA:) in the Kur xxxvii. 82,<br>\
some say that it means with a grieving, or sorrowful, heart; from سَلِيمٌ in the sense here next following. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q. لَدِيغٌ [meaning Bitten<br>\
by a serpent]; (S, M, K;) as also ↓ سَلَامٌ (S, K)<br>\
and ↓ مَسْلُومٌ: (K:) app., (S,) as implying a good<br>\
omen, of safety; (S, M;) or because the person<br>\
is left (مُسْلَمٌ) to that [bane] which is in him:<br>\
(IAar, S, * M:) and sometimes it is metaphorically used as meaning (tropical:)  wounded: (M:) or it<br>\
means wounded, at the point of death, (M, K,)<br>\
as some say: (M:) pl. سَلْمَى. (M, and Ham<br>\
p. 214.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (M, K,) of a horse, (M,) The<br>\
part, of the hoof, that is between the أَشْعَر [or<br>\
hair, or extremity of the skin, next the hoof],<br>\
(M, TA,) or that is between the أَمْعَر [q. v.], (K,)<br>\
but the former is the right, (TA,) and the interior<br>\
of the hoof. (M, K, TA.)<br>\
سَلَامَةٌ [the most usual inf. n. of سَلِمَ]: see سَلَامٌ,<br>\
in three places.<br>\
-A2-  Also n. un. of سَلَامٌ applied to<br>\
a kind of trees [described above]. (S, K.)<br>\
سُلَامَى, a noun of the fem. gender, (Msb,) A<br>\
certain bone that is in the فِرْسِن [q. v., here<br>\
meaning foot] of the camel: (S, K:) this is said<br>\
by A&#39;Obeyd to be the primary signification: (S:)<br>\
or the سُلَامَى of the camel are the bones of the<br>\
فُرْسِن [or foot]: (M:) [for] سُلَامَى is used alike<br>\
as sing. and pl., and sometimes it has also a pl.,<br>\
(S,) which is سُلَامَيَاتٌ: (S, M, K:) or it is a pl.<br>\
[or rather a coll. gen. n.], of which the sing. [or<br>\
n. un.] is سُلَامَيَةٌ, signifying the أَنْمَلَة [q. v.] of<br>\
[any of] the fingers: (IAth, TA:) [but this is a<br>\
strange explanation:] it is said that the last parts<br>\
in which مُخّ [here meaning marrow or pulp and<br>\
the like] remains in a camel when he has become<br>\
emaciated are the سُلَامَى and eye; and when<br>\
it has gone from these, he has none remaining:<br>\
(S:) the pl. سُلَامَيَاتٌ, (S, TA,) or سُلَامَى, (M,<br>\
Msb,) also signifies the bones of the أَصَابِع, (S,<br>\
M,) so says Kh, and Zj adds that they are also<br>\
called the قَصَب, (Msb,) of the hand and of the<br>\
foot; (M;) [i. e., of the fingers and of the toes;<br>\
and this seems to be the most common meaning,<br>\
in relation to a human being; namely, the phalanges of the fingers and of the toes;] that are<br>\
between every two joints [and what are beyond<br>\
the extreme joints] of the أَصَابِع: accord. to Lth,<br>\
the سلامى are the bones of the أَصَابِع [or fingers<br>\
and toes] and the أَشَاجِع and the أَكَارِع, and are<br>\
hard and compact bones like كِعَاب [pl. of كَعْبٌ]:<br>\
(TA: [see the words that I have here left untranslated, for the senses in which they are here used are<br>\
doubtful:]) accord. to IAar, (M,) certain small<br>\
bones, of the length of the إِصْبَع [or finger], (M,<br>\
K,) or nearly so, (M,) or less, (K,) of which<br>\
there are four, or three, (M,) [or app., five, for<br>\
the meaning here seems to be the metacarpal and<br>\
metatarsal bones, to which the terms سُلَامَى and<br>\
سُلَامَيَاتٌ are sometimes applied, (see أَشْجَعُ and<br>\
مُشْظٌ,)] in the hand and in the foot, (K,) [i. e.]<br>\
in each hand and foot: (M:) Ktr says that the<br>\
سلاميات are the عُرُوق [app. a mistake for عِظَام<br>\
i. e. bones] of the outer side of the hand and<br>\
foot: (Msb:) سلامى is also said to signify any<br>\
small hollow bone: and any bone of a human<br>\
being: and ISh says that in every horse are six<br>\
سلاميات [app. in the fore legs and the same in<br>\
the hind legs; for he seems to mean that the<br>\
term سلامى is applied to each of the pasternbones and to the coffin-bone; these three corresponding to the phalanges of a human being:<br>\
see فَصٌّ]: (TA:) it is not allowable to write<br>\
سلامى otherwise than with what is termed the<br>\
short alif. (MF, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  سُلَامَى, (M, K,) like<br>\
سُكَّارَى, (K, TA, [in the CK like سَكْرٰى, which is<br>\
shown to be wrong by a verse cited in the M and<br>\
TA,]) signifies also The [south, or southerly,<br>\
wind called] جَنُوب. (M, K.)<br>\
سَلَامَانٌ A kind of tree, (S, M, K,) growing in<br>\
soft, or plain, tracts: (M:) AZ says, it is like the<br>\
أَلَآء, which is a tree resembling the myrtle, which<br>\
changes not in the midst of summer, and which<br>\
has a produce resembling the head [or ear] of<br>\
millet (ذُرَة), except that it is smaller than the الآء;<br>\
tooth-sticks (مَسَاوِيك) are made from it; and its<br>\
produce is like that of the الآء; and it grows in<br>\
the sands and the deserts: (TA in art. الأ:) n. un.<br>\

سُلَّمٌ A ladder, or a series of stairs or steps,<br>\
syn. مِرْقَاةٌ, (M, K,) and دَرَجَةٌ, (M,) or مِعْرَاجٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) upon which one ascends; (S, Mgh;) either<br>\
of wood or of clay [&amp;c.]: (Mgh:) said by Zj to<br>\
be so called because it delivers thee (يُسَلِّمُكَ) to<br>\
the place to which thou desirest to go, (Mgh,<br>\
TA,) i. e., to some high place, and thou hopest<br>\
for safety (السَّلَامَة) by means of it: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) masc. and fem.; (Lth, M, Mgh;) [app.,<br>\
accord. to Lth and F, generally fem.; for] accord.<br>\
to Lth, one says, هِىَ السُّلَّمُ and هُوَ السُّلَّمُ; (Mgh;)<br>\
[and F says,] it is sometimes made masc.: (K:)<br>\
pl. سَلَالِيمُ (S, Mgh, K) and سَلَالِمُ, (K,) [which<br>\
latter is the original, for] the ى in سَلَالِيمُ is added<br>\
by poetic license. (M, TA.) [Hence,] السُّلَّمُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Certain stars, below [those called] العَانَةُ, on the<br>\
right of them; (K;) as being likened to the سُلَّم<br>\
[above-mentioned]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The غَرْز [or<br>\
stirrup of the camel&#39;s saddle] (S, K) is sometimes<br>\
thus called [as being a means of mounting]. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  A means to a thing; (K, TA;) because<br>\
it leads to another thing like as does the سُلَّم upon<br>\
which one ascends. (TA.) ―<br>\

-A2-  The saying<br>\
of J [in the S], (K,) in which he has followed<br>\
his maternal uncle El-Fárábee, (TA,) that it<br>\
signifies The portion of skin between the eye<br>\
and the nose, is a mistake; (IB, K;) and his<br>\
citation, as an authority, of the verse of &#39;AbdAllah Ibn-&#39;Omar (K) in which he says,<br>\
وَجِلْدَةُ بَيْنَ العَيْنِ وَالأَنْفِ سَالِمُ<br>\
(TA,) is futile: (K:) for, as IB says, Sálim was<br>\
the son of Ibn-&#39;Omar, who, by reason of his love<br>\
of him, thus makes him to be as the skin between<br>\
his eyes and his nose: or, as MF says, the truth is,<br>\
that the said verse is by Zuheyr, and Ibn-&#39;Omar<br>\
used it as a proverb: and [SM says], if this be<br>\
correct, it strengthens the saying of J. (TA.)<br>\
أَسْلَمُ [More, and most, safe or secure or free<br>\
from evils of any kind]. You say, هٰذَا أَسْلَمُ مِنْ<br>\
