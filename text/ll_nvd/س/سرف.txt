سَرِفَ, aor.<br>\
سَرَفَ, inf. n. سَرَفٌ, He was ignorant:<br>\
or he was unmindful, negligent, or heedless.<br>\
(Msb.) [In these senses it is trans.: you say,]<br>\
سَرِفَهُ, (S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
سَرَفَ, (K,) inf. n. سَرَفٌ, (S, *<br>\
M, K, *) He was unmindful, negligent, or heedless, of it; (S, M, K;) namely, a thing: (S, M:)<br>\
and he was ignorant of it: (S, K:) and he missed<br>\
it; (S, * M, K; * [in the first and third of which,<br>\
only the inf. n. of the verb in this sense in mentioned, and expl. as syn. with خَطَأٌ;]) syn. أَخْطَأَهُ.<br>\
(M.) And طَلَبْتُهُمْ فَسَرِفْتُهُمْ I sought them and<br>\
missed them: or was ignorant of them. (Msb.)<br>\
And سَرِفَ القَوْمَ He passed by the people, or<br>\
party, and left them behind him. (M.) As<br>\
relates, of an Arab of the desert, with whom<br>\
some companions of his made an appointment to<br>\
meet him in a certain place of the mosque, and to<br>\
whom he broke his promise, that, being asked<br>\
respecting that, he said, مَرَرْتُ بِكُمْ فَسَرِفْتُكُمْ, meaning [I passed by you and] I was unmindful of<br>\
you. (S.) And hence the saying of Jereer, (S,<br>\
TA,) praising the Benoo-Umeiyeh, (TA,)<br>\
أَعْطَوْا هُنَيْدَةَ يَحْدُوهَا ثَمَانِيَةٌ<br>\
مَا فِى عَطَائِهِمُ مِنٌّ وَلَا سَرَفُ<br>\
meaning [They gave a hundred camels, eight<br>\
persons driving them, or urging them by singing<br>\
to them: there was not in their gift reproach for<br>\
a benefit conferred, nor] unmindfulness: or the<br>\
meaning is, nor missing (خَطَأٌ); that is, they did<br>\
not miss the proper place of the gift by their<br>\
giving it to such as did not deserve it and refusing it to the deserving. (S, TA.) You say<br>\
also, سَرِفْتُ يَمِينَهُ I was unacquainted with, or<br>\
knew not, his oath. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [سَرَفٌ is also, as<br>\
expl. below, syn. with إِسْرَافٌ, but as a subst.,<br>\
having no verb properly belonging to it.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
سَرَفَتِ الشَّجَرَةَ, (ISk, S, K,) aor.<br>\
سَرُفَ, inf. n. سَرْفٌ,<br>\
(ISk, S,) said of the سُرْفَة [q. v.], It ate the<br>\
leaves of the tree: (ISk, S, K:) and سَرَفَتِ الخَشَبَ<br>\
is likewise said of the سُرْفَة [as meaning it ate the<br>\
wood]. (Z, TA.) And سُرِفَتِ الشَّجَرَةُ, (ISk, S, M,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. سَرْفٌ, (ISk,) The tree had its leaves<br>\
eaten by the سُرْفَة: (S:) or was smitten, or lighted<br>\
on, by the سُرْفَة: (ISk, M, TA:) and سَرِفَ الخَشَبُ<br>\
[the wood was eaten by the سُرْفَة], the verb in<br>\
this phrase being quasi-pass. of the verb in the<br>\
phrase سَرَفَتِ السُّرْفَةُ الخَشَبّ, like as حَطِمَ and<br>\
صَعِقَ are quasi-passives of the verbs in the phrases<br>\
حَطَمَتْهُ السِّنُّ and صَعَقَتْهُ السَّمَآءُ: (Z, TA:) and<br>\
[hence] one says also, سَرِفَ الطَّعَامُ (tropical:)  The wheat, or<br>\
food, was, or became, cankered, or eaten away;<br>\
as though smitten, or lighted on, by the سُرْفَة.<br>\

or limit, or measure; acted extravagantly, exorbitantly, or immoderately: (M, Msb:) or<br>\
إِسْرَافٌ signifies the being extravagant in expenditure, syn. تَبْذِيرٌ; (K) or so إِسْرَافٌ فِى النَّفَقَةِ:<br>\
(S, TA:) or, as some say, تبذير means the “ exceeding in respect of the right objects of expenditure,” which is ignorance of the [right] manner,<br>\
and of things that should prevent it; and اسراف<br>\
means the exceeding with respect to quantity [in<br>\
expenditure], and is ignorance of the values of<br>\
the right objects: (MF in art. بذر:) or the latter<br>\
signifies the expending otherwise than in obedience of God, (Sufyán, K, * TA,) whether little or<br>\
much; (TA;) as also ↓ سَرَفٌ: (M, TA:) it is<br>\
also said to mean the eating that which it is not<br>\
lawful to eat; and this is said to be meant in<br>\
the Kur vi. 142 or vii. 29: and the putting a<br>\
thing in a wrong place [as when one expends<br>\
his money upon a wrong object]: and accord. to<br>\
Iyás Ibn-Mo&#39;áwiyeh, الإِسْرَافُ is that [action]<br>\
whereby one falls short of what is due to God.<br>\
(TA.) You say also, اسرف فِى مَالِهِ, meaning<br>\
He was hasty in respect of his property, [i. e. in<br>\
expending it,] without pursuing the just course,<br>\
or keeping within due bounds. (M.) And اسرف<br>\
فِى الكَلَامِ and فِى القَتْلِ He exceeded the due<br>\
bounds, or just limits, in speech, and in slaying.<br>\
(M.) الإِسْرَافُ فِى القَتْلِ, which is forbidden in the<br>\
Kur xvii. 35, is said to mean The slaying of<br>\
another than the slayer of one&#39;s companion:<br>\
(Zj, M, Mgh: *) or the slaying the slayer without<br>\
the authority of the Sultán: or the not being<br>\
content with slaying one, but slaying a number<br>\
of persons, because of the high rank of the slain<br>\
and the low condition of the slayer: or the slaying one higher in rank than the slayer: (Zj, M:)<br>\
or the slaying two when the slayer is one: or the<br>\
maining or mutilating [before slaughter]. (Mgh.)<br>\
إِسْرَافٌ also signifies The committing of many<br>\
faults, offences, or crimes, and sins. (TA.) And<br>\
you say, أَكَلَهُ إِسْرَافًا (TA) and ↓ سَرَفًا, (M, TA,)<br>\
meaning He ate it hastily. (M, TA.)<br>\

paragraph.])<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  And also a subst. from أَسْرَفَ; (Msb;) i. q.<br>\
إِسْرَافٌ; (M;) signifying Excess, or transgression, of the just, or right, bound, or limit, or<br>\
measure; extravagant, exorbitant, or immoderate, action or conduct; (M, Msb, TA;) contr.<br>\
of قَصْدٌ. (S, K.) See also 4, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence,] (tropical:)  The overflowing of water from the<br>\
sides of a watering-trough, or tank; as in the<br>\
saying, ذَهَبَ مَآءُ الحَوْضِ سَرَفًا (tropical:)  The water of the<br>\
watering-trough, or tank, [went away running to<br>\
waste, or] overflowed from its sides: (K, TA:)<br>\
or سَرَفُ المَآءِ means (assumed tropical:)  what goes, of water, without<br>\
irrigating and without profit: [or rather its<br>\
going for nought:] you say, أَرْوَتِ البِئْرُ النَّخِيلَ<br>\
وَذَهَبَ بَقِيَّةُ المَآءِ سَرَفًا (assumed tropical:)  [The well irrigated the palmtrees, and the rest of the water went for nought,<br>\
in waste]. (Sh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And Addictedness<br>\
(ضَرَاوَةٌ, S, K, or لَهَجٌ M) to a thing, (M,) or in<br>\
respect of wine. (K, TA.) It is said in a trad.<br>\
(S, M) of &#39;Áïsheh, (TA,) إِنَّ لِلَّحْمِ سَرَفًا كَسَرَفِ<br>\
الخَمْرِ [Verily there is an addictedness to flesh-meat like the addictedness to wine]: (S, M, TA:)<br>\
i. e. he who is accustomed to it is addicted to the<br>\
eating thereof, like as he who is constantly drinking wine is addicted thereto, having little selfrestraint therefrom: or the meaning here is unmindfulness [of consequences with respect to flesh-meat &amp;c.]: or corruptness of conduct, arising<br>\
from hardness of heart, and daringness to disobey, and self-impulsion to the gratification of<br>\
appetite: (TA:) or it may be [that the meaning<br>\
is, there is an extravagance with respect to flesh-meat &amp;c.,] from الإِسْرَافُ (S, TA) in expenditure<br>\
for that which is not needed, or otherwise than<br>\
in obedience [to the law of God]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  It<br>\
is also said in a trad., لَا يَنْتَهِبُ الرَّجُلُ نُهْبَةً ذَاتَ<br>\
سَرَفٍ وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ, meaning, ذَاتَ شَرَفٍ وَقَدْرٍ كَبِيرٍ<br>\
[i. e. The man shall not take a thing as spoil that<br>\
is of high and great estimation, he being a believer]: (K, TA:) [for] people disapprove of<br>\

or intelligence: or (tropical:)  corrupt in intellect; accord. to<br>\
Z, from سَرَفَتِ السُّرْفَةُ الخَشَبَ, of which the quasipass. is سَرِفَ [q. v.; meaning that it is from سَرِفٌ<br>\
as a part. n. of this latter verb]. (TA.) ―<br>\

makes for itself a habitation, (S, K,) four-sided,<br>\
or square, (S,) of fragments of wood, (S, K,)<br>\

the form of a نَاؤُوس [here meaning coffin], (S,)<br>\
which it then enters, and [therein it] dies: (S,<br>\
K:) or the silkworm: or a certain small creeping thing, dust-coloured, that constructs a beautiful habitation in which it is: or a very small<br>\
creeping thing, like the half of a lentil, that<br>\
bores a tree, and then constructs therein a habitation of pieces of wood, which it conjoins by<br>\
means of what resembles the web of the spider:<br>\
or a very small dust-coloured creeping thing, that<br>\
comes to a piece of wood and excavates it, and<br>\
then brings a bit of wood and puts it therein, then<br>\
another, then another, and then weaves what resembles the web of the spider: or, accord. to<br>\
AHn, a certain small creeping thing, like the<br>\
worm, inclining in some degree to blackness,<br>\
found upon the [plants called] حَمْض, that constructs a four-sided, or square, habitation, of<br>\
pieces of wood, joining the extremities of these<br>\
