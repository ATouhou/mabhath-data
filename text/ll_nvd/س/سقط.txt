ground; (Mgh;) or from a higher to a lower<br>\
place; (Msb;) namely, a thing from the hand;<br>\
(S;) or from a high place, as a roof of a house;<br>\
and from a low place, as when said of a person in<br>\
an erect posture; (B;) also said of a building;<br>\
(TA in art. هور;) and of a جُرْف [q. v.]: (Msb<br>\
and TA in that art.:) [and often used by anatomists and physicians, as meaning it delapsed; it<br>\
slipped, or fell, down:] and ↓ اِسَّاقَطَ [originally<br>\
تَسَاقَطَ] signifies the same; (K;) as in the phrase<br>\
in the Kur [xix. 25], تَسَّاقَطْ عَلَيْكِ رُطَبًا جَنِيًّا, or<br>\
يَسَّاقَطْ, accord. to different readings, It, namely<br>\
the palm-tree (نَخْلَة) accord. to the former reading, and the trunk (جِذْع) accord. to the latter<br>\
reading, shall drop upon thee with fresh ripe<br>\
dates, plucked; رطبا جنيّا being transferred from<br>\
its proper place, and used as a specificative; the<br>\
meaning being, يَسَّاقَطْ رُطَبُ الجِذْعِ: so says Fr.<br>\
(Az, TA.) [This phrase of the Kur, with the<br>\
above-mentioned explanation, but less fully given,<br>\
occurs in a copy of the S which, throughout this<br>\
art., differs much from other copies.] You say also,<br>\
سَقَطَ فُلَانٌ مَغْضْلَرRِيًّا عَلَيْهِ [Such a one fell down in a<br>\
swoon]. (TA.) And مَنْ نَازَعَ أَطْوَلَ مِنْهُ سَقَطَ<br>\

-b3-  سُقِطَ فِىيَدِهِ, and فى ↓ أُسْقِطَ<br>\
يده, (Fr, Zj, S, M, K,) but the former is more<br>\
common, and better, (Fr,) the latter allowed by<br>\
Akh, but disallowed by AA and by Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà [i. e. Th], (S,) [lit. There was a falling, and<br>\
there was a making to fall, upon his hand; i. e.,<br>\
of his hand upon his hand, or of his teeth upon<br>\
his hand, by reason of repentance, and grief, or<br>\
regret; meaning] (tropical:)  he repented, (Fr, Zj, S, M,<br>\
K,) of what he had done; and grieved for, or<br>\
regretted, an act of inadvertence; (Zj, M;) or,<br>\
and became confounded, or perplexed, and unable<br>\
to see his right course: (O, K:) or both signify,<br>\
(TA,) or signify also, (K,) or the former signifies<br>\
also, (M,) he slipped; fell into an error, or a<br>\
fault; committed a mistake. (M, K.) Hence the<br>\

bites his hand in sorrow, so that his hand is fallen<br>\
upon [by his teeth]: (Bd:) the phrase was not<br>\
known to the Arabs before the time of the Kur-án:<br>\
(O:) it has also been read سَقَطَ فى ايديهم, (Akh,<br>\
S, M,) as though النَّدَمُ were understood; (Akh,<br>\
S;) i. e. سَقَطَ النَّدَمُ; like as you say, قَدْ حَصَلَ<br>\
فِى يَدِهِ مِنْ هٰذَا مَكْرُوهٌ, likening what comes into<br>\
the heart, and into the mind, to what comes into<br>\
the hand, and is seen with the eye: (M, TA:)<br>\
and this, as well as the former, is tropical. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  سَقَطَ القَمَرُ (tropical:)  The moon set: and in like manner النَّجْمُ [the star, or asterism; generally<br>\

who practises evasions, shifts, artifices, or the<br>\
