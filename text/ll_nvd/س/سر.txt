سَرَّهُ, accord. to the TA, has two contr.<br>\
significations: for it is there stated that “ one<br>\
says سَرَرْتُهُ meaning كَتَمْتُهُ and سَرَرْتُهُ meaning<br>\
أَعْلَنْتُهُ: ” and it is added that “ it will occur again<br>\
soon: ” but it does not again occur in that work,<br>\
nor have I found it in any other lexicon: I<br>\
therefore think that it is a mistranscription, for<br>\
أَسْرَرْتُهُ, first pers. of أَسَرَّهُ, q. v.]<br>\
-A2-  سَرَّهُ, (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
سَرُ3َ, (MS,) inf. n. مَسَرَّةٌ (S, O,<br>\
K) and سُرُورٌ [which latter, from the explanations<br>\
of it which will be found below, seems to be<br>\
generally, if not only, as an inf. n., that of سُرَّ,]<br>\
and سُرٌّ [which is also syn. with سُرُورٌ in the senses<br>\
assigned to the latter below] and سُرَّى and تَسِرَّةٌ<br>\
[which last may be also an inf. n. of ↓ سرّرهُ expl.<br>\
by Freytag as syn. with سَرَّهُ in the sense here<br>\
following, but without an indication of any authority], (O, K,) He, or it, rejoiced him; gladdened him; or made him happy; syn. أَفْرَحَهُ:<br>\
(Msb, K:) [or made him to experience a pleasure, or delight, and dilatation of the heart, of<br>\
which there was no external sign: see سُرُورٌ,<br>\
below.] And سُرَّ, [inf. n. سُرُورٌ, (see above,)] He<br>\
rejoiced; was joyful, or glad; or was happy:<br>\
(S, * A, * K:) [or he experienced a pleasure, or<br>\
delight, and dilatation of the heart, of which<br>\
there was no external sign; accord. to an explanation of سُرُورٌ:] you say, سُرَّ بِهِ and ↓ اِسْتَسَرَّ [He<br>\
rejoiced, was joyful or glad, or was happy, by<br>\
reason of him, or it]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سَرَّهُ, (K,) aor. as<br>\
above, (TA,) also signifies He saluted him with<br>\
[the offering of what are termed] المَسَرَّة, i. e. the<br>\
extremities of sweet-smelling plants. (K.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
Also سَرَّهُ, (S, M,) aor. as above, inf. n. سَرٌّ, (S,) or<br>\
سِرٌّ, (so in a copy of the M,) He cut his (a<br>\
child&#39;s) سِرَر, or سُرّ, i. e. navel-string. (S, M.) And<br>\
سُرَّ He (a child) had his navel-string cut. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And سَرَّهُ, aor. as above, He pierced him, or<br>\
thrust him, [with a spear or the like,] in his<br>\
سُرَّة [or navel]: a poet says,<br>\
وَإِنْ أَدْبَرُوا فَهُمُ مَنْ يُسَبْ  نَسُرُّهُمُ إِنْ هُمُ أَقْبَلُوا<br>\
[We pierce them in the navel if they advance;<br>\
and if they retreat, they are those who are pierced<br>\

-A4-<br>\
سَرَّ الزَّنْدَ, aor. as above, inf. n. سَرٌّ, He put a piece<br>\
of wood, (M, K,) or a little piece of wood, (S,)<br>\
in the interior of the زند [or piece of stick, or<br>\
wood, for producing fire], (M,) or in its extremity, (S, K,) inserting it in its interior, (S,) in<br>\
order that he might produce fire with it. (S, M,<br>\
K.) One says, سُرَّ زَنْدَكَ فَإِنَّهُ أَسَرُّ Fill up the interior of thy زند, that it may produce fire, (AHn,<br>\
M,) for it is [worn] hollow. (S, K.)<br>\
-A5-  سَرَّ, [sec.<br>\
pers. سَرِرْتَ,] aor. يَسَرُّ, (IAar, Sgh, L, K,) inf. n.<br>\
سَرَرٌ, remarked upon by MF as extr., [though it<br>\
is agreeable with a general rule,] said of a man,<br>\
(TA,) He had a complaint of the سُرَّة [or navel].<br>\
(IAar, Sgh, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, aor. and inf. n. as in<br>\
the next preceding case, said of a camel, He<br>\
had the pain, or disorder, termed سَرَرٌ [q. v.].<br>\
(IAar, M.)<br>\
2<br>\
سَرَّ3َ see 1, second sentence.<br>\
-A2-  سَرَّرْتُهُ in the<br>\
phrase سَرَّرْتُهُ سُرِّيَّةً I gave him, or caused him to<br>\
take, a concubine slave, doubly trans., is [said to<br>\
be] changed to سَرَّيْتُهُ for alleviation of the pronunciation. (Msb.)<br>\
-A3-  سرّرهُ, inf. n. تَسْرِيرٌ, said of<br>\

3<br>\
سارّهُ, inf. n. مُسَارَّةٌ and سِرَارٌ, (S, M,) [He<br>\
spoke, or discoursed, secretly to him or with him;]<br>\
he acquainted him with a secret. (M.) You say,<br>\
سارّهُ فِى أُذُنِهِ He spoke secretly to him in his ear.<br>\
(S, * K, * TK.) And كَانَ يُحَدِّثُهُ كَأَخِى السِّرَارِ<br>\
occurs in a trad., meaning He (Mohammad) used<br>\
to talk to him (&#39;Omar) in a low voice, like him<br>\
who is telling a secret. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَيْعُ السِّرَارِ is<br>\
The selling in which one says, “I will put forth<br>\
my hand and thou shalt put forth thy hand, and<br>\
if I produce my signet-ring before thee, it is a<br>\
sale for such a price; and if thou produce thy<br>\
signet-ring before me, for such a price: ” if they<br>\
produce together, or do not both produce, they do<br>\
thus again. (Mgh.)<br>\
4<br>\
اسرّهُ, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِسْرَارٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) [and accord. to the TA سَرَّهُ; but see the<br>\
first sentence of this art.;] He concealed it;<br>\
suppressed it; kept it secret; (S, M, A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K;) namely, a story, or the like: (A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) and, contr., he manifested it; revealed it;<br>\
published it; made it known. (S, M, Msb, K.)<br>\
Both of these significations have been assigned to<br>\
the verb in the phrase وَأَسَرُّوا النَّدَامَةَ, in the Kur<br>\
[x. 55 and xxxiv. 32]: (S:) some say, that the<br>\
meaning is They will manifest repentance: Th<br>\
says, they will conceal it from their chiefs: the<br>\
former [says ISd] is the more correct: (M:) the<br>\
former meaning is also given on the authority of<br>\
AO; but Sh says, I have not heard it on the<br>\
authority of any other; and Az says that the<br>\
lexicologists most strongly disapprove of the<br>\
saying of AO; and it is said that the meaning is,<br>\
they, the chiefs of the polytheists, will conceal<br>\
repentance from the lower class of their people,<br>\
whom they shall have caused to err; and in like<br>\
manner say Zj and the [other] expositors. (TA.)<br>\
In like manner also the two contr. significations<br>\
are assigned to the verb in the saying of Imra-el-<br>\
Keys, [in his Mo&#39;allakah,] لَوْ يُسِرُّونَ مَقْتَلِى,<br>\
which As used to quote with ش, thus, لَوْ يُشِرُّونَ<br>\
مَقْتَلِى, meaning that they might publish, or<br>\
make known, my slaughter. (S.) You say also,<br>\
أَسَرَّ إِلَيْهِ حَدِيثًا He revealed unto him a story (S,<br>\
K) secretly. (TA.) An ex. occurs in the Kur<br>\
lxvi. 3. (TA.) And أَسْرَرْتُ إِلَيْهِ المَوَدَّةَ, and<br>\
بِالمَوَدَّةِ, I showed, or manifested, to him love, or<br>\
affection. (S.) It is said in the Kur [lx. 1],<br>\
تُسِرُّونَ إِلَيْهِمْ بِالْمَوَدَّةِ, meaning, Ye reveal to them<br>\
the news of the Prophet by reason of the love that<br>\
is between you and them; the objective complement of the verb being suppressed: or المودّة may<br>\
be an objective complement, the ب being a redundant corroborative, as in أَخَذَ الخِطَامَ and<br>\
أَخَذَ بِهِ: (Msb:) and this interpretation is correct; for إِسْرَارٌ to a person necessarily implies<br>\
revealing a secret to him and at the same time<br>\
concealing it from another. (B.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَأَسَرُّوهُ بِضَاعَةً,<br>\
in the Kur xii. 19, signifies And they concealed,<br>\
or kept secret, his case, making him as an article<br>\
of merchandise: (Jel:) or they conjectured in<br>\
their minds that they should obtain, by selling<br>\
him, merchandise. (TA.) [See also an ex. voce<br>\
اِرْتَغَى, in art. رغو.] ―<br>\
-b3-  اسرّ الفَاتِحَةَ, and بِالفَاتِحَةِ,<br>\
He recited the Fátihah [or First Chapter of the<br>\
Kur-án] secretly, or inaudibly: (Msb:) or the<br>\
latter form of expression is a mistake. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
أَسْرَرْتُهُ also signifies نَسَبْتُهُ إِلَى السِّرِّ [which may<br>\
mean either I attributed it to secrecy, or, like<br>\
many phrases of this kind, by inversion, I attributed to him secrecy, or mystery]. (Msb.)<br>\
5<br>\
تسرّر and<br>\
تسرّى, (M, K,) and ↓ استسرّ, (K,)<br>\
He took to himself a concubine-slave. (M, * K, *<br>\
TA.) And تَسَرَّرْتُ جَارِيَةً, and تَسَرَّيْتُهَا, (S,) and<br>\
↓ اِسْتَسَرَّيْتُهَا, (TA,) I took to myself a girl, or<br>\
young woman, as a concubine-slave. (S, * TA.)<br>\
تَسَرَّرْتُهَا is [said to be] thus changed to تَسَرَّيْتُهَا,<br>\
(T, S, Msb,) for alleviation of the pronunciation,<br>\
(Msb,) on account of the three ر s following one<br>\
another, (T,) being like تَظَنَّنْتُ and تَظَنَّيْتُ.<br>\
(T, * S.) Lth says that تسرّيت is a mistake; but<br>\
Az says that it is correct. (TA.) ↓ اِسْتَسَرَّنِى<br>\
occurs in a trad. as signifying He took me to<br>\
himself as a concubine-slave; but by rule one<br>\
should say تَسَرَّرَنِى, or تَسَرَّانِى: as to ↓ استسرّنى,<br>\
it [more properly] signifies “ He revealed to me<br>\
his secret. ” (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تَسَرَّرَ فُلَانٌ بِنْتَ فُلَانٍ [as<br>\
though signifying Such a one took to himself the<br>\
daughter of such a one as a concubine-slave] is<br>\
said when a man of low birth takes as his wife a<br>\
woman or girl of high birth because of the<br>\
abundance of his property and the littleness of<br>\
hers. (M.)<br>\
6<br>\
تسارّوا They spoke, or discoursed, secretly<br>\
together; acquainted one another with secrets.<br>\
(S, K.) [See also 3.]<br>\
-A2-  تسارّإِلَى ذٰلِكَ (tropical:)  He experienced pleasure, or delight, at that: as, for<br>\
instance, at his scratching a part of his body, or<br>\
pressing, or kneading, it; and at a thing disliked<br>\
by another person. (A, TA.) [But I am in some<br>\
doubt as to the correctness of this, and incline to<br>\
think that it is a mistake for ↓ استسرّ.]<br>\
10<br>\
استسرّ He, or it, became concealed; or he,<br>\
or it, concealed himself or itself: (K:) it (a<br>\
thing, or an affair,) became hidden or concealed<br>\
or secret: (A, Msb:) it (the moon) became concealed (S, M, A, TA) by the light of the sun,<br>\
(TA,) [i. e. by its proximity to the sun,] for one<br>\
night, or for two nights. (AO, S.)<br>\
-A2-  استسرّهُ He<br>\

keeping it secret. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5, in four<br>\

(TA.)<br>\

سَرٌّ A man who rejoices, or gladdens, another;<br>\
or makes him happy; (S, K;) [and so ↓ سَارٌّ:]<br>\

goodness and affection and gentleness, and rejoices<br>\
&amp;c., (S, K, TA,) his brethren: (TA:) pl. بَرُّونَ<br>\

وَاحِدِ ↓ وَلَدَتْ ثَلَاثَةً فِى سَرَرٍ She brought forth<br>\
three [boys] consecutively, or one at the heels of<br>\

سِرٌّ A secret; a thing that is concealed, or suppressed, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) in the mind;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ سَرِيرَةٌ: (S, M, A, K:) or the<br>\
former has the above-mentioned signification,<br>\
and the latter signifies a secret action, whether<br>\
good or evil: (Lth:) [and the former, also, a<br>\
