سَاحَ, (S, Mgh, K,) or سَاحَ عَلَى وَجْهِ الأَرْضِ,<br>\
(A,) aor. يَسِيحُ, (S, K,) inf. n. سَيْحٌ (S, A, Mgh,<br>\
K) and سَيَحَانٌ, (K,) It (water) ran upon the<br>\
surface of the earth. (S, A, Mgh, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
hence, (TA,) سَاحَ فِى الأَرْضِ, (S, A, Msb,) aor.<br>\
as above, (S, Msb,) inf. n. سِيَاحَةٌ, (A,) or سَيْحٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) or both, and سُيُوحٌ and سَيَحَانٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
said of a man, (A,) (tropical:)  He went, or journeyed,<br>\
through the land, or earth, (S, L, K, &amp;c.,) for<br>\
the purpose of devoting himself to religious services or exercises: (L, K:) or in this restricted<br>\
sense, which MF asserts to be unmentioned in<br>\
most of the older books, and thinks to be conventional, the verb has only the first of the<br>\
inf. ns. above, and in the absolute sense it has<br>\
the second and third and fourth. (TA.) It is<br>\
said in a trad., لَا سِيَاحَةَ فِى الإِسْلَامِ (S, A, TA)<br>\
i. e. (tropical:)  [There shall be no going about through the<br>\
land, or earth, in the way of devotees, in ElIslám: or] no quitting of the cities, or towns,<br>\
and going, or journeying, through the land, or<br>\
earth: (TA:) or no quitting of the cities, or<br>\
towns, and dwelling in the deserts, and forsaking<br>\
the being present at the congregational prayers<br>\
and at assemblies: or no going about through the<br>\
land, or earth, doing evil, or mischief, and calumniating and corrupting. (IAth, TA.) The سِيَاحَة<br>\
of the Muslims [in a religious sense, and such as<br>\
is approvable,] is (assumed tropical:)  Fasting. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence<br>\
also,] سَاحَ الظِّلُّ The shade changed, or turned,<br>\
or moved, from side to side, or from place to<br>\
place. (S, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
سَيَّحَ [سيّح is said by Golius, as on the authority<br>\
of the K, to signify He made water to flow: and<br>\
this is probably its primary and proper signification, whence other meanings, which are tropical:<br>\
but it is not in the K.] ―<br>\
-b2-  See 4. ―<br>\
-b3-  سيّح فُلَانٌ,<br>\
[app. for سيّح كَلَامَهُ,] inf. n. تَسْيِيحٌ, (tropical:)  Such a<br>\
one talked much. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And سُيِّحَ, inf. n.<br>\
as above, (assumed tropical:)  It (a garment, or piece of cloth,) had<br>\
in it [or was diversified with] various stripes.<br>\
(L.) [And in like manner it is said of other<br>\
things: see its part. n., مُسَيَّحٌ.]<br>\
4<br>\
اساح نَهْرًا He made a river, or rivulet, to<br>\
flow, or run. (A, K.) [See also 2.] ―<br>\
-b2-  اساح<br>\
الفَرَسُ جُرْدَانَهُ (A) or ذَكَرَهُ (L) (tropical:)  The horse put<br>\
forth his veretrum from its prepuce; (L;) and<br>\
↓ سيّح signifies the same: (A, L:) or both of<br>\
these verbs, said of a horse, are syn. with رَفَّضَ<br>\
[q. v.]. (TA in art. رفض.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اساح بِذَنَبِهِ,<br>\
said of a horse, (assumed tropical:)  He let his tail hang down<br>\
loosely: (K:) accord. to the K, J is in error in<br>\
writing this verb اشاح; and Az says that اساح is<br>\
right, and that اشاح is a mistranscription: the<br>\
like is also said in the TS: but اشاح is asserted<br>\
by more than one to be the right word. (TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انساح بَطْنُهُ (assumed tropical:)  His belly became large (K,<br>\
TA) and wide, (TA,) and approached [the<br>\
ground] by reason of fatness. (K, TA.) One<br>\
says of a she-ass, انساح بَطْنُهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Her<br>\
belly became big, and approached the ground.<br>\
(IAar, T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  انساح بَالُهُ (tropical:)  [His, or its, state, or<br>\
condition,] became free from straitness, or unstraitened. (S, O, K.) A poet says, (S,) namely,<br>\
Dhu-r-Rummeh, (O,)<br>\
أُمَنِّى ضَمِيرَ النَّفْسِ إِيَّاكِ بَعْدَمَا<br>\
يُرَاجِعُنِى بَثِّى فَيَنْسَاحُ بَالُهَا<br>\
(tropical:)  [I make the secret thoughts of the soul to wish<br>\
for thee after my grief, or sorrow, returns to<br>\
me; and then the state, or condition, thereof,<br>\
becomes free from straitness]. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  انساح<br>\
said of a garment, or piece of cloth, (K, TA,)<br>\
&amp;c., (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  It became much rent, or rent in<br>\
several places. (K, TA.) In like manner it is<br>\
said of the dawn [as meaning (assumed tropical:)  It broke]. (TA.)<br>\
And it is said in the trad. relating to the cave<br>\
(الغَار [mentioned in the Kur ix. 40]) فَانْسَاحَتِ<br>\
الصَّخْرَةُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [And the mass of rock] became<br>\
impelled and riven: and hence, [accord. to some,]<br>\
the ↓ سَاحَة of a house [expl. in art. سوح]: but as<br>\
some relate it, the verb in this instance is<br>\
[انصاخت,] with ص and خ. (TA.)<br>\
سَيْحٌ Running water; (S, Msb;) an inf. n. used<br>\
as a subst.: (Msb:) or running external water:<br>\
(K:) or external water running upon the surface<br>\
of the earth: (T, TA:) the water of rivers and<br>\
valleys: (Mgh:) pl. سُيُوحٌ. (T, TA.) [And it is<br>\
used as an epithet:] you say also (TA) مَآءٌ سَيْحٌ<br>\
(A, TA) and ↓ سَائِحٌ (A) Water running upon<br>\
the surface of the earth: (A, TA:) pl. of the<br>\
former أَسْيَاحٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A striped [garment<br>\
of the kind called] كِسَآء, (K, TA,) with which<br>\
one covers himself, and which one spreads: (TA:)<br>\
or a striped [garment such as is called] عَبَآءَة: and<br>\
a sort of [the garments called] بُرُود: (S:) pl.<br>\
سُيُوحٌ. (TA.) See also مُسَيَّحٌ.<br>\
سَاحَةٌ: see 7; and see also art. سوح.<br>\
سَيَّاحٌ (tropical:)  An itinerant, a roamer, or frequent<br>\
traveller: (A, * MA:) from سَاحَ فِى الأَرْضِ. (A.)<br>\
سَائِحٌ: see سَيْحٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  A man going,<br>\
or journeying, [as a devotee, or otherwise,] through<br>\
the land or earth. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, as being likened<br>\
thereto, (tropical:)  Fasting, or a faster: (A:) or a faster<br>\
who keeps to the mosques: (K:) the faster is said<br>\
to be thus called because he who journeys as a<br>\
devotee does so without having any provision<br>\
with him, and eats only when he finds provision:<br>\
therefore the faster is likened to him. (TA.)<br>\
السَّائِحُونَ in the Kur ix. 113 means (tropical:)  The fasters:<br>\
(Bd, Jel, TA:) so say Zj and I&#39;Ab and Ibn-Mes&#39;ood: (TA:) or those who observe the obligatory fasts: or those who fast constantly: (TA:)<br>\
or those who journey to war against unbelievers,<br>\
or to seek knowledge. (Bd.) And سَائِحَات in the<br>\
Kur lxvi. 5 means (assumed tropical:)  Women who fast: or who<br>\
forsake their country or homes [for the sake of<br>\
God]. (Bd, Jel.) ―<br>\
-b4-  This last (سائحات [if not a<br>\
mistranscription for سَابِحَات]) also means (assumed tropical:)  Swift<br>\
horses: ―<br>\
-b5-  and (assumed tropical:)  The planets. (KL.)<br>\
مَسَاحٌ or مَسَاحَةٌ, the latter of the measure<br>\
مَفْعَلَةٌ, from السِّيَاحَةُ, [each app. meaning (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
place of سِيَاحَة, or journeying,] is sing. of مَسَايِحُ,<br>\
in which the ى is like that in مَعَايِشُ, as in other<br>\
similar words of which the medial radical is an<br>\
infirm letter, except مَصَائِبُ, by rule مَصَاوِبُ.<br>\
(Har p. 15.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [The pl. مَسَايِحُ is also expl. by<br>\
Freytag as applied in the Deewán of Jereer to<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The part of the head between the temples as far<br>\
as the forehead (where the hairs are).]<br>\
مُسَيَّحٌ (assumed tropical:)  Striped; applied in this sense to a<br>\
[garment of the kind called] بُرْد; (S, K;) and<br>\
also, with ة, to a [garment such as is called]<br>\
عَبَآءَة: (S:) or applied to [the garments called]<br>\
عَبَآء as meaning having alternate stripes of white<br>\
and black, the latter not intensely black: every<br>\
عباءة also is termed ↓ سَيْحٌ and مُسَيَّحَةٌ: but that<br>\
which has not stripes is a كِسَآء, not an عباءة.<br>\
(ISh, TA.) So too applied to locusts (جَرَاد);<br>\
(K;) and with ة applied to a single locust [i. e.<br>\
جَرَادَة]: (TA:) or, applied to locusts, it means<br>\
marked with black and yellow and white stripes<br>\
or streaks. (As, TA.) It is also applied as an<br>\
epithet to the [bird called] حَيْقُطَان. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
(tropical:)  The wild ass: so called because of his streak<br>\
that makes a division between the belly and the<br>\
side. (K, TA.) مُسَيَّحُ العَجِيزَةِ (tropical:)  [He that has the<br>\
rump streaked] is an epithet applied to the [wild]<br>\
ass because of the whiteness on his rump. (A,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  A road of which the tracks (شَرَك or<br>\
شُرُك in different copies of the K) are rendered<br>\
apparent: (K, TA:) likened to the عَبَآء thus<br>\
termed. (TA.)<br>\
مِسْيَاحٌ (tropical:)  One who goes about calumniating, and<br>\
making mischief, in the land: (S, A, K:) pl.<br>\
مَسَايِيحُ: so in the trad., لَيْسُوا بِالمَسَايِيحِ وَلَا<br>\
بِالمَذَايِيعِ البُذُرِ (tropical:)  [They are not of those who go<br>\
about calumniating, &amp;c., nor of the babblers who<br>\
cannot keep secrets.] (S, TA.) Sh derives it, not<br>\
from السِّيَاحَةُ, but, from تَسْيِيحُ الثَّوْبِ. (L, TA.)<br>\
