هَدُرَ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. هَدْرٌ (S, Msb, K) and هَدَرٌ, (K,) or<br>\
the latter is a simple subst., (Msb,) It (a man&#39;s<br>\
blood, S, A, Msb, K, or another thing, K) went<br>\
for nothing; [meaning, in the case of blood,<br>\
unretaliated, and uncompensated by a mulet; as<br>\
shown below, voce هَدَرٌ;] it was, or became, of<br>\
no account, null, or void; (S, A, Msb, K;) as<br>\

(A, Msb, K;) as also ↓ اهدرهُ; (S, A, Msb, K;)<br>\

to be taken, or shed. (S, TA.) Thus these two<br>\
verbs are trans. as well as intrans. (Msb.) It<br>\
is said in a trad, مَنِ اطَّلَعَ فِى دَارٍ بِغَيْرِ إِذْنٍ فَقَدْ<br>\

pass unnoticed, or host taken no account of<br>\
me, by annulling in respect of me the prescribed<br>\

says,<br>\
وَهَدَرَ الجَدَّ مِنَ النَّاسِ الهَذَرْ<br>\

advanced in age, (S, in art. نقض,) [He brayed;<br>\
i. e.,] he reiterated his voice in his حَنْجَرَة [or<br>\
windpipe, or the head of his windpipe]: (S:) or<br>\
he uttered his voice, not in a شِقْشِقَة [q. v.]: (K:)<br>\
and ↓ هدّر, (S, K,) inf. n. تَهْدِيرٌ, (S,) signifies the<br>\
same: (S, K:) Z mentions also تَهْدَارٌ as an inf.<br>\
n. of هَدَرَ said of a stallion, [meaning a stallioncamel.] (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the saying, (TA,)<br>\
هُوَ يَهْدِرُ فِى مَنْطِقِهِ, and فِى خُطْبَتِهِ, (tropical:)  [He is<br>\
sonorous and fluent in his speech, and in his<br>\

in its حَنْجَرَة [or windpipe, or the head of its windpipe]: (A:) its cry being apparently likened to<br>\

[meaning, in the case of blood, unretaliated, and<br>\
uncompensated by a mulct;] what is of no account,<br>\
ineffectual, null, or void; (A, K;) [as also جُبَارٌ.]<br>\
You say, دِمَاؤُهُمْ هَدَرٌ بَيْنَهُمْ Their blood (lit, bloods)<br>\
is made to go for nothing, or to be of no account,<br>\
among them; (K, * TA:) is allowed to be taken,<br>\
or shed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also هَادِرٌ.<br>\
هُدَرَةٌ: see هَادِرٌ; the former, in two places.<br>\
هِدَرَةٌ: see هَادِرٌ; the former, in two places.<br>\

(Kr, K,) and ↓ هُدَرَةٌ; (S, K;) which last is also<br>\

which it seems to be implied that هَدَرَةٌ and<br>\
↓ هِدَرَةٌ are also applied, each, to a man and to a<br>\
woman; but it appears from what is said in the<br>\
TA that this is not the case:]) pl. هَدَرَةٌ and هُدَرَةٌ<br>\
and هِدَرَةٌ; the first of which is the most agreeable<br>\
with analogy, like كَفَرَةٌ, pl. of كَافِرٌ; the second<br>\
being of a measure exclusively belonging to words<br>\
which are unsound [in the last radical letter], as<br>\
in the instances of غُزَاةٌ and قُضَاةٌ, [originally غُزَوَةٌ<br>\
and قُضَيَةٌ, pls. of غَازٍ and قَاضٍ,] unless, indeed, it<br>\
be a quasi-pl. n.; and some disapprove it, finding<br>\
fault with IAar who relates it: the third, moreover, is not a pl. of a form, [regularly] belonging<br>\
to a sing. of the measure فَاعِلٌ, whether sound or<br>\
unsound: (ISd, TA:) [or, accord. to Sb, it is a<br>\
quasi-pl. n.:] or it is pl. of ↓ هِدْرٌ. (TA,) which<br>\
signifies a heavy man, (K, TA,) in whom is no<br>\
good; analogous with قِرَدَةٌ, pl. of قِرْدٌ. (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ هَدَرٌ [a quasi-pl. n. of هَادِرٌ, like as خَدَمٌ is<br>\
of خَادِمٌ,] signifies low, ignoble, or mean, people,<br>\
in whom is no good. (TA.) You say, هُمْ هَدَرَةٌ,<br>\
(S, A, K,) and هِدَرَةٌ, (IAar, TS, K,) and هُدَرَةٌ,<br>\
(IAar, ISd, K,) (tropical:)  They are low, ignoble, or mean,<br>\
people; of no account, or worthless. (IAar, S,<br>\
A, * K, &amp;c.)<br>\
-A2-  [A braying camel: fem. with ة<br>\
pl. of the latter, هَوَادِرُ. You say,] إِبِلٌ هَوَادِرٌ<br>\
[Braying camels;] camels reiterating their voices<br>\
in their حَنَاجِر. (S.) See also مُهَدِّرٌ, and مُبَحْثِرٌ.<br>\
and هَدَّارٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence the saying,] فُلَانٌ فُحْلٌ هَادِرٌ<br>\
(tropical:)  [app. Such a one is a vigorous orator of sonorous<br>\
and fluent speech]. (A.)<br>\
كَالْمُهَدِّرِ فِى العُنَّةِ [Like the brayer in the<br>\
enclosure of wood, or canes, or trees]: a proverb:<br>\
applied to a man who raises a cry and clamour<br>\
which is followed by nothing, (S, A, *) or who<br>\
raises a cry and clamour and does not make his<br>\
saying or action to have effect: (A, K) like<br>\
the camel that is confined in the enclosure of<br>\
wood or canes or trees, prevented from covering,<br>\
and brays. (S, K.)<br>\
