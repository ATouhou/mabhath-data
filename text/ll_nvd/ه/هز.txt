which see what is said on an ex. below,] (A, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
هَزُ3َ, (A, Msb,) inf. n. هَزٌّ, (S, A, Msb,) [He<br>\
shook it;] he put it in motion, or into a state of<br>\
commotion; (S, A, Msb, K;) as also ↓ هزّزهُ, (S,<br>\
K,) and هزّز بِهِ, (TA,) inf. n. تَهْزِيزٌ; (K;) and<br>\

made it move by pulling and pushing; or he made<br>\
it move to the right and left: or, accord. to Er-Rághib, he did so with violence, or vehemence.<br>\
(TA.) It is said that هَزَّ is trans. by itself, and by<br>\
means of بِ, like أَخَذَ and تَعَلَّقَ: it is trans. in<br>\
the latter manner in the Kur., [xix. 25,] where<br>\
it is said, وَهُزِّى إِلَيْكِ بِجِذْعِ النَّخْلَةِ [And shake<br>\
thou towards thee the trunk of the palm-tree],<br>\
i. e. حَرِّكِى: but ISd says, that the verb is here<br>\
made trans. by means of ب because it is used in<br>\
the sense of جُرِّى: and MF says, that, properly,<br>\
it is not trans. by means of ب. (TA.) You<br>\
say, هَزَّ السَّيْفَ وَغَيْرَهُ [He shook the sword, &amp;c.]<br>\
