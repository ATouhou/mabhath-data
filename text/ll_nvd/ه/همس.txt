هَمَس, aor.<br>\
هَمِسَ, (A, TA,) inf. n. هَمْس<br>\
(AHeyth, L, TA) and هَمِيسٌ and هُمُوسٌ, (L,<br>\
TA,) He spoke inaudibly: (AHeyth, TA:) or in a<br>\
low, faint, gentle, or soft, manner, (AHeyth, TA,)<br>\
so as to be hardly intelligible. (TA.) It is said<br>\
in a trad. فَجَعَلَ بَعْضُنَا يَهْمِسُ إِلَى بَعْضٍ And<br>\
some of us began to speak to others in a low,<br>\
faint, gentle, or soft, manner, so as to be hardly<br>\
intelligible. (TA.) And in another trad., كَانَ<br>\
ذَا إِصَلَّى العَصْرَ هَمَسَ بِشَىْءٍ لَا نَفْهَمُهُ He used,<br>\
when he performed the afternoon-prayer, to utter<br>\
something in a low, faint, gentle, or soft manner,<br>\
we not understanding it. (TA.) You say also,<br>\
هَمَسَ إِلَىَّ بِحَدِيثِهِ [He uttered his discourse to<br>\
me inaudibly: or in a low, faint, gentle, or soft,<br>\
manner.] (A.) And الشَّيْطَانُ يَهْمِسُ بِوَسْوَسَتِهِ صَدْرَ<br>\
الإِنْسَانِ [The devil speaks inaudibly in his suggesting vain or unprofitable things into the bosom<br>\
of man]. (A.) And هَمَسَ الشَّيْطَانُ فِى الصَّدْرِ<br>\
The devil suggested vain, or unprofitable things<br>\
in the bosom; syn. وَسْوَسَ. (TA.) See also<br>\
هَمْسٌ below. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
He made the faintest, or slightest, sound in treading. So in the saying, إِهْمِسْ وَصَهْ and هَمْسًا وَصَهْ<br>\
Make thou the faintest, or slightest, sound in<br>\
treading, and be thou silent: addressed by a thief<br>\
to his companion. (TA.) And hence the saying<br>\
of the Rájiz,<br>\
فَهُنَّ يَمْشِينَ بِهِ هَمِيسَا<br>\
And they walk with him making the faintest, or<br>\
slightest, sound in treading. (S.) هَمِيسٌ also<br>\
signifies The walking softly; with a soft-sounding tread: (TA:) [and so هَمْسٌ; as in the saying,] سَمِعْتُ هَمْسَ الأَخْفَافِ وَالأَقْدَامِ [I heard<br>\
the soft-sounding treading of the feet of camels<br>\
and of the feet of men]. (A.) See also هَمْسٌ<br>\
below.<br>\
-A2-  هَمَسَ الصَّوْتَ, aor.<br>\
هَمِسَ, inf. n. هَمْسٌ,<br>\
He made the sound, or voice to be low, faint,<br>\
gentle, or soft. (Msb.) And هَمَسَ الكَلَامَ, [aor.<br>\
and] inf. n. as above, [He spoke in a low, faint,<br>\
gentle, or soft manner; like هَمَسَ alone; lit.,]<br>\
he made speech, or the speech to be low, faint,<br>\
gentle, or soft. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  هَمَسَ الطَّعَامَ, (TK),<br>\
[aor. and] inf. n. as above, (AZ, K,) He chewed<br>\
the food with the mouth closed: (AZ, K, TA:)<br>\
or without opening the mouth. (TA.) You say,<br>\
هُوَ يَْكُلُ هَمْسًا He eats without opening his mouth.<br>\
(A.) Hence, a toothless old woman&#39;s eating is<br>\
termed هَمْسٌ. (AHeyth.) هَمَسَهُ also signifies<br>\
[simply] He chewed it. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
هامسهُ, inf. n. مُهَامَسَةٌ, He spoke, or discoursed secretly to him, or with him. (A.) You<br>\
say also, هَامَسُوا, (TK,) inf. n. as above, (K,)<br>\

also ↓ تهامسوا. (K, * TK.)<br>\

هَمْسٌ A low, faint, gentle, or soft, sound. (S,<br>\
A, Msb, K.) So it has been explained as occurring in the words of the Kur, [xx. 107,] فَلَا<br>\
تَسْمَعُ إِلَّا هَمْسًا [So that thou shalt not hear<br>\
aught save] a low, faint, gentle, or soft, sound,<br>\
arising from the shifting of the feet from place to<br>\
place towards the scene of congregation [for the<br>\
general judgment]: or, as Az thinks, the meaning here is, the sound of the patting, or pattering,<br>\
of the feet (خَفْقَ الأَقْدَامِ) upon the ground.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The faint, or gentle, sound of the voice<br>\
in the mouth, of such kind as has no mixture of<br>\
the voice of the chest, nor loudness of utterance.<br>\
(Lth, K.) See also مَهْمُوسٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  And Anything<br>\
low, faint, gentle, or soft, (كُلُّ خَفِىٍّ, K, TA,)<br>\
of speech and the like: (TA:) [see again, مَهْمُوسٌ:]<br>\
or the faintest, or slightest, sound of the feet;<br>\
(S, K;) i. e., of their tread upon the ground:<br>\
(TA:) so [accord. to J] in the instance in the<br>\
Kur, [xx. 107,] mentioned above: (S:) and<br>\
[in like manner] ↓ هَمِيسٌ signifies the sound of<br>\
the shifting from place to place of the feet of<br>\
camels. (K.) See also 1.<br>\
هَمِيسٌ: see 1: and see هَمْسٌ.<br>\
كَلَامٌ مَهْمُوسٌ [Speech spoken inaudibly: or<br>\
in a low, faint, gentle, or soft manner, so as to be<br>\
hardly intelligible: see 1: or] speech not spoken<br>\
out or openly. (A, * Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حَرْفٌ مَهْمُوسٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) or حَرْفُ الهَمْسِ, (IJ,) [A letter which is<br>\
pronounced with the breath only, without the<br>\
voice; a non-vocal letter; a sound with which<br>\
the breath passes forth, not from the voice of the<br>\
chest, but passing forth gently; (IJ;) contr. of<br>\
مَجْهُورٌ: (Msb:) الحُرُوفُ المَهْمُوسَةُ are the letters<br>\
(ten in number, S,) which are comprised in the<br>\
saying حَثَّهُ شَخْصٌ فَسَكَتْ: (S, K: *) so called<br>\
[accord. to some] because the stress is made<br>\
weak in the place where any one of them occurs<br>\
until the breath has passed forth with it. (Sb, S.)<br>\
