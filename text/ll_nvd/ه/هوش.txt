some saying ↓ تَهَاوِشَ; and some, تَهَاوُشٍ; and<br>\
some, نَهَاوِشَ, with ن, which is explained in the<br>\

S is that which is commonly known by the<br>\
lexicologists; but all are correct, excepting that<br>\
تَهَاوِش, with ت, and with a kesreh to the و, is<br>\
disapproved by some of the lexicologists: (TA:)<br>\
this last word is a contraction of تَهَاوِيشُ, pl. of<br>\
↓ تَهْوَِاشٌ, of the measure تَفْعَالٌ from الهَوْشُ, (K,<br>\
TA,) meaning “ the collecting ”; and “ mixing,”<br>\
“ confusing,” or “ confounding ”: (TA:) or from<br>\

تَأْكُلُ مَاجَمَعْتَ مِنْ تَهْوَاشِ<br>\
[Thou eatest what thou hast collected of things<br>\
unlawfully acquired]. (Sgh, TA.)<br>\
