مَا زَالَ يَهِيطُ, inf. n. هَيْطٌ; and مَا زَالَ فِى<br>\
هَيْطٍ وَمَيْطٍ; He ceased not to be engaged in crying<br>\
out, or vociferating, or calling for aid or succour;<br>\
and in evil, or mischief; and raising a clamour,<br>\
or confused noise. (K.) IKtt says, that يهيط<br>\
has no pret. (TA.) [See also 3.]<br>\

هِيَاطٌ [in the senses assigned to it in what<br>\
here follows] is an inf. n. of which the verb<br>\
[هَايَطَ] is obsolete. (L.) You say, مَا زَالَ فِى<br>\
هِيَاطٍ وَمِيَاطٍ He ceased not to be in a state of<br>\
approaching, or drawing near, and retiring to a<br>\
distance: (K:) or هِيَاطٌ signifies the act of<br>\
advancing: (Lh:) or هِيَاطٌ and مِيَاطٌ respectively<br>\
signify the most vehement driving in coming to<br>\
water, and the most vehement driving in returning<br>\
from water; and the meaning is, going and<br>\
coming: (Aboo-Tálib:) or both signify the being<br>\
in a state of commotion, tumult, or disturbance;<br>\
as some say, arising from their saying “ No, by<br>\
God,” and “ Yes, by God: ” (TA:) [it is also<br>\
said that] مُهَايَطَةٌ [which is likewise an inf. n. of<br>\
مَايَطَ] signifies the act of crying out, or vociferating; and raising a clamour, or confused<br>\
noise; [(see also 1;) and so, app., هِيَاطٌ; for it<br>\
is immediately added,] one says, وَقَعَ القَوْمُ فِى<br>\
هِيَاطٍ وَمِيَاطٍ [as though meaning the people, or<br>\
company of men, fell into vociferating, &amp;c.].<br>\
(S.) بَيْنَهُمَا مُهَايَطَةٌ is also said to signify<br>\
Between them two is low, faint, or gentle,<br>\
speaking. (TA.) [See مِيَاطٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to<br>\
IAar, هايطهُ signifies He esteemed him weak.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تهايطوا They came together, or coalesced,<br>\
and arranged, or adjusted, their affairs; (Fr.,<br>\
S, K;) contr. of تمايطوا. (Fr, S.)<br>\
هَائِط and مَائِطٌ are explained by IAar as signifying Going and coming. (TA.)<br>\
هيع &amp;c.<br>\
