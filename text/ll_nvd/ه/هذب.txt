-b7-  MF says, on the authority of the etymologists, that the original signification of ↓ تَهْذِيبٌ<br>\
and هَذْبٌ is The clearing, or trimming, of trees,<br>\
by cutting off the extremities of the branches, in<br>\
order that they may increase in growth and<br>\
beauty; that they were then used to signify the<br>\
cleansing, or purifying, of anything; and putting<br>\
it into a right, or proper, state; trimming it;<br>\
or adjusting it; and clearing it of any dirty or<br>\
filthy things, or the like, mixed with it; so that<br>\
these became their proper meanings by general<br>\
acceptation: and that they were then used to<br>\
signify the trimming and embellishing of verse,<br>\
and clearing it of whatever might vitiate it in the<br>\
opinion of the chaste in language, and the philologists: but the truth is what is said in the L;<br>\
that the original signification of تهذيب is the<br>\
clearing the colocynth of its pulp, and preparing<br>\
its seeds so that they may lose their bitterness, and<br>\
become sweet. (TA.)<br>\
