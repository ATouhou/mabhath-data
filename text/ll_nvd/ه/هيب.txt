↓ هَيِّبَانٌ, (TA, [see هَائِبٌ]) A he-goat: (K:)<br>\
explained by the word تَيْسٌ; but this is a<br>\
signification not found [by SM] elsewhere, and<br>\
appears to be a mistake for مَنْتَفِشٌ; for in the<br>\
L and other lexicons we find the word explained<br>\
by مُنْتَفِشٌ خَفِيفٌ, Scattered, and light; with a<br>\
citation of the following verse of Dhu-r-Rummeh:<br>\
تَمُجُّ اللُّغَامَ الهَيَِّبَانَ كَأَنَّهُ<br>\
جَنَى عُشَرٍ تَنْفِيهِ أَشْدَاقُهَا الهُدْلُ<br>\
[She ejects from her mouth the scattered and<br>\
light froth, as though it were plucked fruit of the<br>\
&#39;oshar which the flabby sides of her mouth cast<br>\
forth:] and we also find, in the R, قُطْنٌ هيّبانٌ<br>\
explained as signifying cotton that is plucked, or<br>\
teased with the fingers, so as to become scattered;<br>\
syn. منتفش: or هيّبان signifies, in the abovecited verse, accord. to some, Light, [which<br>\
signification is also given in the K, but in the<br>\
CK displaced; following, instead of preceding,<br>\
the word الرَّاعِى, and without و before it;] and<br>\
separated into small particles: (TA:) [or] the<br>\
froth of the mouth of camels; (Az, K;) i. q.<br>\
لُغَامٌ: (Mj, Sifr es-Sa&#39;ádeh:) Az cites the above<br>\
verse; and says, that the fruit of the عُشَر [or<br>\
asclepias gigantea] comes forth like a small<br>\
pomegranate, and, when burst open, discloses<br>\
what resembles [white] raw silk; to which the<br>\
poet likens the froth of the camel&#39;s mouth.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  هَيَّبَانٌ (or هَيِّبَانٌ, TA,) A pastor. (K,<br>\
from Es-Seeráfee.) [Accord. to the CK, a light,<br>\
or an active pastor: but see above.] ―<br>\

هَائِبٌ [act. part. n. of هَابَ, Regarding with<br>\
reverence, veneration, dread, or awe; with fear;<br>\
with cautious fear, or caution;] fearing men.<br>\
(K.) This is the original [simple] epithet. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  The following, which are explained in the K<br>\
in the same manner as the above, are intensive<br>\
epithets: (TA:) namely ↓ هَيُوبٌ (S, K) and<br>\
هَيُوبَةٌ, (S, L,) [in which the ة is added to strengthen<br>\
the intensiveness,] and ↓ هَيَّابٌ and هَيَّابَةٌ, (S,<br>\
K,) in which ة is added for the purpose above<br>\
mentioned, (TA,) and ↓ هَيِّبٌ, (K,) which may be<br>\
contracted into هَيْتٌ, (TA,) and ↓ هَيْبَانٌ (K) and<br>\
↓ هَيِّبَانٌ (S, K) and ↓ هَيَّبَانٌ; (K;) of which last<br>\
two forms, the latter only is admitted by some<br>\
of the learned; but MF admits only the former<br>\
of them; asserting فَيْعَلَانٌ to be unknown as the<br>\
measure of an unsound word, like as فيَعِلَان is<br>\
unknown as that of a sound word except in extr.<br>\
instances; (TA;) [Having much reverence, veneration, dread, or awe; much fear; much<br>\
cautious fear, or caution:] fearing men [much]:<br>\
(K:) a coward, who regards men with awe, or<br>\
fear, &amp;c.: (S:) [The last of these epithets is<br>\
also explained in the CK as signifying having<br>\
much fear, or very fearful; (كَثِيرُ الخَوْفِ;) and<br>\
a coward: but in the TA and in a MS copy of the<br>\
K, الخوف is omitted; and in the TA is added<br>\
by the author, after كثير, the words من كلّ<br>\
شىُ; as though the meaning of the word were<br>\
“ much, or many, of any things: ” the correct<br>\
reading seems to be the former, and the meaning intended by SM, having much fear, or very<br>\
fearful, of everything: in like manner] ↓ هَيُوبٌ<br>\
signifies a man who fears everything. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
↓ الإِيمَانُ هَيُوبٌ [Faith is fearful, or very fearful; i. e.,] he who possesses faith fears acts of<br>\
disobedience: occurring in a trad.: (S:) in this<br>\
case, هيوب is used in the sense of an act. part.<br>\
n.: or it signifies [faith is feared; or regarded<br>\
with reverence, &amp;c.; i. e.,] he who possesses faith<br>\
is feared, or regarded with reverence, &amp;c.: in<br>\
which case هيوب is used in the sense of a pass.<br>\
part. n. (TA.)<br>\
هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ مَهْيَبَةٌ لَكَ [This thing is a cause of<br>\
awe, or fear, to thee]. (S.)<br>\
مَهَابٌ: see مَهِيبٌ.<br>\
مَهَابَةٌ: see هَيْبَةٌ.<br>\
مَهُوبٌ: see مَهِيبٌ.<br>\
مَهِيبٌ and ↓ مَهُوبٌ, (S, K,) the former agreeable with rule, (TA,) and ↓ هَيُوبٌ, (K) [respecting which see also هَائِبٌ,] and ↓ هَيْبَانٌ, (Th, IM,<br>\
K,) [Regarded with reverence, veneration, respect, honour, dread, or awe; with fear; with<br>\
cautious fear, or caution;] a man whom others<br>\
regard with reverence, &amp;c.; (S;) a man whom<br>\
others fear. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَكَانٌ مَهُوبٌ, formed from<br>\
the verb هُوبَ, the original ى being changed into<br>\
و (S, K,) A place regarded with awe, or fear;<br>\
(S;) a place in which one is impressed with awe,<br>\
or fear: as also ↓ مَكَانٌ مَهَابٌ: (S, K:) مَهَابٌ<br>\
signifies a place of awe, or fear. (IB.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
المَهِيبُ and المَهُوبُ and ↓ المُتَهَيَّبُ (assumed tropical:)  The lion:<br>\
(K:) because regarded with awe, or fear, by<br>\
men. (TA.)<br>\
المُتَهَيَّبُ: see المَهِيبُ.<br>\
