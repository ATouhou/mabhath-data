and هَنٌّ<br>\
A thing: and a penis: and the<br>\
vulva of a woman: (KL:) or the former is<br>\
pl. [or coll. gen. n.] of ↓ هَنَةٌ, which signifies a<br>\
small, or little, thing: (MA:) or this last signifies a thing, (KL,) as does هَنٌ: (K, KL:)<br>\
[but the former meaning I have found to be very<br>\
common, and I think it the more approvable.<br>\
↓ هَنَةٌ may be rendered something, somewhat:]<br>\
it denotes anything. (TA.)<br>\
هَنَةٌ<br>\
: see هَنٌ.<br>\
