10<br>\
استهضب It became what is termed هَضْب,<br>\
(K,) or هَضْبَة; (A;) i. e. a mountain of the kind<br>\
so termed. (A.)<br>\
هَضْبٌ A kind, mode, or way. A. Heyth quotes<br>\
the following verse of El-Kumeyt, describing a<br>\
horse:<br>\
مُخَيَّفٌ بَعْضُهُ وَرْدٌ وَسَائِرُهُ<br>\
جَوْنٌ أَفَانِينُ إِجْرِيَّاهُ لَا هَضْبُ<br>\
The poet means, that his running, or usual running, was of different, or various, kinds; not of<br>\
one هضب, or kind. (L.)<br>\
-A2-  See هَضْبَةٌ.<br>\
هَضَبٌ: see هَضْبَةٌ.<br>\
هَضْبَةٌ A rain: (S, K:) or a rain consisting<br>\
of many drops: (IAth:) or a lasting rain, consisting of great drops: or a single fall thereof:<br>\
(TA:) or hard rain: (Msb:) pl. هِضَبٌ, (S,<br>\
K,) like بِدَرٌ pl. of بَدْرَةٌ, (S,) extr. [with respect<br>\
to rule], (TA,) and هِضَابٌ, (K,) or this is pl. of<br>\
هَضْبٌ accord. to the S; (TA;) and pl. pl.<br>\
أَهَاضِيبُ; (K;) or this is pl. of هِضَابٌ, which is<br>\
pl. of ↓ هَضْبٌ, signifying fine showers of rain<br>\
after other rain; syn. حَلَبَاتُ قَطْرٍ بَعْدَ قَطْرٍ; (AZ,<br>\
S;) and this is what is correct: (TA:) or ↓ هَضْبٌ<br>\
signifies a fine rain; or a fine shower of rain;<br>\
syn. حَلْبَةُ قَطْرٍ: it is also said, in the L, that<br>\
↓ أُهْضُوبَةٌ is syn. with هَضْبٌ, [either in one of the<br>\
last two senses, or as a coll. gen. n. of which<br>\
هَضْبَةٌ is the n. un., which it is said to be below,]<br>\
and that اهاضيب is its pl.: ↓ هُضُوبَةٌ also is the<br>\
same as اهضوبة: so in the phrase أَصَابَتْهُمُ الهضوبةُ<br>\
مِنَ المَطَرِ [The fine shower, or showers, of rain<br>\
(or the shower of rain, or of copious rain, or of<br>\
lasting rain consisting of large drops, or hard<br>\
rain,) fell upon them]; mentioned in the K: it<br>\
is also said in the L, that هَضْبٌ forms in the pl.<br>\
أَهْضَابٌ, and then أَهَاضِيبُ; like as قَوْلٌ forms<br>\
أَقْوَالٌ, and then أَقَاوِيلُ. (TA.) ↓ هَضْبٌ is also<br>\
said to be a pl. of هَضْبَةٌ; but it is rather a coll.<br>\
gen. n., [of which هَضْبَةٌ is the n. un.]: and هَضَبٌ<br>\
is also added to the list of the pls. of the same<br>\
word; but this, accord. to the S, on the authority<br>\
of AA, is pl. [or rather a quasi-pl. n.] of هَاضِبٌ,<br>\
[act. part. n. of 1,] like as تَبَعٌ is of تَابِعٌ, and<br>\
بَعَدٌ of بَاعِدٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  هَضْبَةٌ A hill; (IAth:)<br>\
or a mountain spreading over the surface of the<br>\
ground: (S, Msb, K:) or a mountain composed<br>\
of one mass of rock: (K:) or any firm, hard,<br>\
large mass of rock: (TA:) or a long inaccessible<br>\
mountain, separate from others; but only of red<br>\
mountains: (K:) or a hill, such as is termed<br>\
أَكَمَة, with few plants, or little herbage: (Msb:)<br>\
pl. هِضَبٌ and هِضَابٌ; (S, K;) and pl. pl. أَهَاضِيبُ.<br>\
(K, TA.) أَهَاضِبُ is used, by poetical licence,<br>\
for اهاضيب, in a poem of one of the Hudhalees:<br>\
(TA:) [or it is pl. of أَهْضُبٌ, which is pl. of pauc.<br>\
of هَضْبٌ]. هَضْبٌ is also said, in the S, and L, to be<br>\
a pl. of هَضْبَةٌ; but it is rather a coll. gen. n.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  An elevated, or overlooking, tract of<br>\
sand. (TA, art. طود.)<br>\
-A3-  (assumed tropical:)  A run; a single<br>\
run. (AHeyth.)<br>\
هِضَبٌّ (tropical:)  A horse sweating much; or that sweats<br>\
much. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hard, or firm, and strong,<br>\
or robust. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Large, or bulky; as an<br>\
epithet applied to the kind of lizard called ضَبّ,<br>\
and to other things. (TA.)<br>\
غَنَمٌ هَضِيبٌ Sheep or goats having little milk:<br>\
(K:) app. form الهَضْبُ, signifying حَلْبَةُ القَطْرِ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
هُضُوبَةٌ: see هَضْبَةٌ.<br>\
هَاضِبٌ, used after the manner of a rel. n.,<br>\
signifying ذُو هَضْبٍ: so in the following expression in a verse of Aboo-Sakhr El-Hudhalee;<br>\
فِى يَوْمٍ مِنَ اللَّهْوِ هَاضِبٍِ; which means In a day<br>\
when the people had played much, and quickly:<br>\
explained by the words كَانُوا قَدْ هَضَبُوا فِى اللَّهْوِ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
أُهْضُوبَةٌ: see هَضْبَةٌ.<br>\
رَوْضَةٌ مَهْضُوبَةٌ [A meadow, or the like, rained<br>\
upon: or much wetted by rain]. (TA.)<br>\
هضل &amp;c.<br>\
