هَرَبَ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
هَرُبَ; not<br>\
هَرَبَ, as some have<br>\
imagined on account of the measure of the first of<br>\
the following inf. ns., imagining thence also that<br>\
the pret. is هَرِبَ; nor<br>\
هَرَبَ with the pret. هَرَبَ, as<br>\
some have supposed because of the guttural letter;<br>\
for a guttural letter, when it is the first, is not<br>\
reckoned as having any influence on the form of<br>\
the aor.; nor<br>\
هَرِبَ, as some have thought; (TA;)<br>\
inf. n. هَرَبٌ (S, K) and مَهْرَبٌ and هَرَبَانٌ; (K;)<br>\

any that returns from water, nor any that comes<br>\

or, he has not anything, nor has he any people;<br>\
an expression similar to مَا لَهُ سَعْنَةٌ وَلَا مَعْنَةٌ:<br>\
(Lh:) accord. to IAar, هَارِبٌ signifies one who<br>\
returns from water; and قَارِبٌ, one who seeks, or<br>\
