هَبَّتِ الرِّيحُ, (S, &amp;c.,) aor. تَهُبُّ, (M, &amp;c.,)<br>\
contr. to analogy; for all reduplicate triliteral<br>\
verbs that are intrans. have kesr in the aor.,<br>\
except twenty-eight, of which this is one; (Lb;)<br>\
inf. n. هُبُوبٌ and هَبِيبٌ (S, K) and هَبٌّ; (K;)<br>\
but this last is not of high repute; (IDrd;) The<br>\
wind blew; rose; was in a state of commotion.<br>\
(S, K, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also said of a foul, or stinking,<br>\
odour. (Msb, in art. قوح.) ―<br>\

النكباء blows]. (TA, art. حص.) ―<br>\

sprightly. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  هَبَّ, inf. n. هَبٌّ and هُبُوبٌ<br>\
and هِبَابٌ, He (any person or animal marching or<br>\
journeying) was brisk, lively, or sprightly, and<br>\
quick: (K:) or هَبَّ, aor. يَهِبَّ, with kesr, inf. n.<br>\
هَبٌّ and هُبُوبٌ, he (any such person or animal)<br>\
was brisk, lively, or sprightly: and هَبَّ, [aor.<br>\
يَهُبُّ,] inf. n. هُبُوبٌ and هِبَابٌ, he (the same) was<br>\
quick, and brisk, &amp;c.: ex. هَبَّتِ النَّاقَةُ, aor. تَهُبُّ,<br>\

in her march, or pace: (TA:) and هَبَّ البَعِيرُ,<br>\

roused, from his sleep. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  هَبَّ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا<br>\
(tropical:)  He began to do so; set about doing so; i. q.<br>\
طَفِقَ. (S, K.) ―<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  Whence hast thou come? (K;) as though you<br>\
said من اين جِئْتَ; i. e., من اين انْتَبَهْتَ لَنَا<br>\
Whence hast thou been roused [to come] to us.<br>\
(S.) [And] أَيْنَ هَبِبْتَ عَنَّا, with kesr, (in some<br>\
copies of the K, حَنَّا is put for عَنَّا; but this is a<br>\
mistake; TA;) Where hast thou absented, or<br>\

-b4-  هَبَّ, aor.<br>\
يَهِبُّ (S, K) and يَهُبُّ, (K,) the latter dev. from<br>\
rule, and not found in other lexicons, but see<br>\
what is cited above from Lb, that هبّ is one of<br>\
the twenty-eight verbs which thus deviate from<br>\
rule, (TA,) inf. n. هَبِيبٌ and هِبَابٌ and هِبَّةٌ; and<br>\
↓ اهتبّ; (S, K;) and ↓ هَبْهَبَ, (K,) inf. n. هَبْهَبَةٌ;<br>\
(TA;) (tropical:)  He (a goat) was excited with lust:<br>\
(TA;) or uttered a sound, or cry, [or rattled,]<br>\
and was excited by desire of the female; or<br>\

desired copulation. (M.) ―<br>\
-b5-  هَبَبْتُ بِهِ I called<br>\
him (a goat, TA) ad initum; ut femellam conscenderet. (K.) [F observes, that J&#39;s giving<br>\
هَبَبْتُهُ in this sense is a mistake: but MF remarks,<br>\
that what J says is ↓ هَبْهَبْتُهُ, he (MF) having<br>\
examined many copies of the S and found them all<br>\
alike in this case, and that this is correct; and<br>\
this is the reading that I find in both of M.<br>\
Fresnel&#39;s copies of the S: see also تَهَبْهَبَ, given<br>\
in the S as quasi-passive of هَبْهَبْتُهُ SM, however,<br>\
states in the TA, that the reading found by him<br>\
in a copy of the S in the handwriting of Yákoot,<br>\
the author of the Moajam, collated with the copy<br>\
of Aboo-Zekereeya Et-Tebreezee and that of<br>\
Aboo-Sahl El-Harawee, is هببت به, as in the K;<br>\
and this, he says, is the genuine reading.]<br>\

4<br>\

the wind to blow; to rise; to be in a state of<br>\
commotion]. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  اهبّه (assumed tropical:)  He awoke him, or<br>\
roused him, from his sleep. (S.) ↓ هَبَّهُ is said to<br>\
signify the same; and in proof thereof is adduced<br>\
a reading in the Kur, deviating from that which<br>\
is universally received as correct; مَنْ هَبَّنَا مِن<br>\
مَّرْقَدِنَا, instead of مَنْ بَعَثَنَا, Who hath roused us<br>\
from our sleeping-place? [ch. xxxvi., v. 52;] but<br>\
IJ rejects this reading, unless it be elliptical, for<br>\
هَبَّ بِنَا. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  اهبّ السَّيْفَ He shook the<br>\
sword; or made it to quiver. (Lh, Sh.)<br>\
5<br>\
