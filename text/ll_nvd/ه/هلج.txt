إِفْعِيلِلٌ, but there are of the measure إِفْعِيلَلٌ, as<br>\
إِهْلِيلَجٌ and إِبْرِيسَمٌ and إِطْرِيفَلٌ, (S,) and هَلِيلَجٌ,<br>\

myrobalan, as well as the myrobalan-tree,] one<br>\
kind of which is yellow, (K,) and another kind<br>\
black, the latter being in the highest state of ripeness, and another kind called كَابُلِىٌّ: it is useful<br>\
as a remedy for quinseys, and preserves the intel-lect, and removes the head-ache, (when used made<br>\
into a conserve, TA,) and is, in the stomach, like<br>\
an intelligent housewife, who is a good manager,<br>\
in the house: (K, TA; but omitted in some<br>\
