(S, A, L, Msb, K,) A certain tribe; [namely, the<br>\
Jews:] (L:) يَهُودُ is said by some to be originally يَهُوذُ, and arabicized by the change of ذ<br>\
into د; but ISd disapproves of this assertion:<br>\
others say, that it is from هَادَ “ he repented: ”<br>\
(L:) it is imperfectly decl., because it is a proper<br>\
name and of the measure of a verb; and [of the<br>\
fem. gen., as it is said to be in the S and L,]<br>\
because it means a قَبِيلَة: but it is allowable to<br>\
prefix to it the art. ال, and to say اليَهُودُ: (Msb:)<br>\
this, however, is allowable only on the ground<br>\
of its being, with the art. prefixed, for اليَهُودِيُّونَ;<br>\
for it is of itself determinate: (S, L:) [thus]<br>\
يَهُودُ is [as it were] pl. of ↓ يَهُودِىٌّ; (L;) which is<br>\
the rel. n. of يهود, or, accord. to Sgh, of يَهُودَا<br>\
[or Judah], thus written by him with the unpointed د in this instance, the son of يَعْقُوب [or<br>\
Jacob]: (Msb:) يَهُودُ (sometimes, TA) has<br>\
يَهْدَانٌ as a pl.: (K:) this pl. occurs in a poem<br>\
of Hassán: (TA:) Fr, says, of هُودًا, in the Kur,<br>\
ii, 105, that it is for يَهُودًا [app. a mistake for<br>\
يَهُودَ]; or that it may be pl. of هَائِدٌ. (L.)<br>\
يَهُودِىٌّ: see يَهُودُ.<br>\

and مُلْهٍ. (IAar, L.)<br>\
مُتَهَوِّدٌ Allied, or allying himself, or seeking to<br>\
