littleness of sense. (S.)<br>\
هَنَبَى &amp;c.: see هُنَّبَاءُ.<br>\
هُنَّبَاءُ (incorrectly written by J, in a verse<br>\
which he quotes, هَنْبَاءُ, K, TA; but in an old<br>\
and excellent copy of the S, I find the word<br>\
written هَنَباءُ;]) and هُنَّبَى (K) and هَنَبَاءُ and<br>\
↓ هَنَبَى (IDrd, K) A woman of weak understanding; without discrimination; stupid; foolish;<br>\
of little sense: (S, K:) accord. to some, as mentioned in a note by Aboo-Zekereeya, in the S, in<br>\
this art., هُنَبَى signifies an insane woman; or<br>\
one possessed by a jinnee. (TA.) هُنَّبَاءُ is the<br>\
only word of the measure فُعَّلَاءُ known to Az.<br>\
(TA.) Accord. to the K, IDrd writes إِمْرَأَةٌ هَنَبَاءُ<br>\
and هَنَبَى: but this is [thought to be] a mistake:<br>\
he gives the two forms هُنَّبَاءُ and هُنَّبَى, as stated<br>\
by IM and others; and, app., هَنَبَى. (TA.) ―<br>\
