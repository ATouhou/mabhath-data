-b4-<br>\
[الهِجْرَةٌ, peculiarly, The emigration, or flight, (for<br>\
it was really a flight,) of Mohammad, from Mekkeh<br>\
to Yethrib, which latter was afterwards called<br>\
El-Medeeneh. Hence, تَأْرِيخُ الهِجْرَةِ The era of<br>\
the Hijreh, or Flight. The epoch of this era is<br>\
not the date of the Flight itself, as some have<br>\
imagined, (for this took place on an uncertain<br>\
day, most probably the first or second, of the<br>\
third lunar month of the Arabian year,) but is<br>\
the first day of the Arabian year in which the<br>\
Flight happened: and as I believe that all<br>\
European writers who have attempted to fix it,<br>\
prior to M. Caussin de Perceval, have erred<br>\
respecting it, the true date, as shown by him,<br>\
(see his “ Essai sur l&#39;Histoire des Arabes,” &amp;c.,<br>\
in the places referred to in the index to that<br>\
work,) I think it important here to mention.<br>\
The first year of the Flight was the two hundred<br>\
and eleventh year of a period during which the<br>\
Arabs made use of a defective luni-solar reckoning, making every third year to consist of thirteen lunar months; the others consisting of<br>\
twelve such months. This mode of reckoning<br>\
was abolished by Mohammad in the twelfth<br>\
month of the tenth year of the Flight, at the<br>\
time of the pilgrimage; whence it appears that<br>\
the first year of the Flight commenced, most<br>\
probably, on Monday, the nineteenth of April,<br>\
A. D. 622; or perhaps on the eighteenth; for<br>\
the actual appearance of the new moon properly<br>\
marked its commencement, and, as the new<br>\
moon happened about sunset on the sixteenth, it<br>\
may perhaps have been seen on the eve of the<br>\
eighteenth. According to M. Caussin de Perceval, the first ten years of the Flight commenced at the following periods.<br>\
1st.[Mon.]Apr. 19, 622<br>\
2nd.[Sat.]May 7, 623<br>\
3rd.[Th.]Apr. 26, 624<br>\
4th.[Mon.]Apr. 15, 625<br>\
5th.[Sat.]May. 3, 626<br>\
6th.[Th.]Apr. 23, 627<br>\
7th.[Tu.]Apr. 12, 628<br>\
8th.[Mon.]May. 1, 629<br>\
9th.[Fri.]Apr. 20, 630<br>\
10th.[Tu.]Apr. 9, 631<br>\
Thus it appears that the first and fourth and<br>\
seventh years were of thirteen lunar months<br>\
each; and the seventh was the last year that was<br>\
thus augmented: therefore, with the eighth<br>\
year commenced the reckoning by common lunar<br>\
years; and from this point we may use the<br>\
tables which have often been published for finding the periods of commencement of years of the<br>\
Flight. We must not, however, rely upon the<br>\
exact accuracy of these tables: for the commencement of the month was generally determined by actual observation of the new moon;<br>\
not by calculation; and we often find that a<br>\
year was commenced, according as the place<br>\
of observation was low or high, or to the east or<br>\
west of the place to which the calculation is<br>\
adapted, or according as the sky was obscure or<br>\
clear, a day later or earlier than that which is<br>\
indicated in the tables; and in some cases, even<br>\
two days later. The twelfth day of the third<br>\
month of the first year of the Flight, the day of<br>\
Mohammad&#39;s arrival at Kubà, was Monday:<br>\
therefore the first day of the year was most probably the nineteenth of April, as two months<br>\
of thirty days each, or twenty-nine days each,<br>\
seldom occur together. But the tenth day of<br>\
the first month of the sixty-first year, the day on<br>\
which El-Hoseyn was slain at Kerbelà, was<br>\
Friday: therefore the first day of that year, at<br>\
that place, must have been Wednesday, the third<br>\
of October, A. D. 680; not the first of October, as<br>\
in most of the published tables above mentioned.<br>\
(For the principal divisions of the Arabian year<br>\
when the luni-solar reckoning was instituted, see<br>\

مَهْجُورٌ Cut off from friendly or loving communion or intercourse; forsaken, or abandoned:<br>\
cut, or not spoken to. (Mgh, Msb.) In like<br>\

signifying avoided, or forsaken, with the tongue,<br>\
or with the heart or mind. (B.) [But see what<br>\
here follows.]<br>\
-A2-  Talk, or language, uttered irrationally or foolishly or deliriously. It is related<br>\
by Aboo-&#39;Obeyd, on the authority of Ibráheem,<br>\
that the words of the Kur, إِنَّ قَوْمِى اتَّخَذُوا هٰذَا<br>\
الْقُرْآنَ مَهْجُورًا, [xxv. 32,] mean, Verily my people<br>\
have made this Kur-án a thing of which they have<br>\
said what is not true: because the sick man,<br>\
when he talks irrationally or foolishly or deliriously, says what is not true: and the like is<br>\
related on the authority of Mujáhid. (S.)<br>\
مُهَاجَرٌ A place to which one emigrates. (Msb.)<br>\
مُهَاجِرٌ Any one, whether an inhabitant of the<br>\
desert [as in the primary acceptation of the epithet] or an inhabitant of a town or village or<br>\
cultivated district, who emigrates; or who forsakes<br>\
his country or district or the like, and takes up his<br>\
abode in another country or district or the like.<br>\
Hence المُهَاجِرُونَ applied to The emigrants to<br>\
El-Medeeneh: because they forsook their places<br>\
of abode in which they were reared, for the sake<br>\
of God, and attached themselves to an abode in<br>\
which they had neither family nor property,<br>\
when they emigrated to El-Medeeneh. (TA.)<br>\
