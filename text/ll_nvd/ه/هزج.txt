هَزِجَ, aor.<br>\
هَزَجَ, (S, K,) inf. n. هَزَجٌ; (L;) He<br>\
sang in a certain manner, with trilling, or quavering; as also ↓ تهزّج; (S, K;) and ↓ هزّج: (K:)<br>\
or ↓ تهزّج signifies he reiterated, or made to reciprocate, the graceful modulations of his voice:<br>\
or prolonged his voice, without elevating it: (Aboo-Is-hák, L:) or هَزَجٌ does not at all signify trilling,<br>\
or quavering; and therefore IAar has applied<br>\
هَزِجٌ as an epithet to a dog that barks much.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He read, or recited, with a prolonging<br>\
and trilling of the voice, making the sounds to<br>\
follow closely, one upon another; as also ↓ تهزّج.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
هزّج الصَّوْتَ, inf. n. تهْزِيجٌ, He (a singer<br>\
[or a reader or reciter]), made the sounds of the<br>\
voice to be closely consecutive, and uttered in a<br>\
light and quick manner. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  هزّج صَوْتَهُ,<br>\
and ↓ تهزّجهُ, [the latter app. a mistake for تهزّج<br>\
فِيهِ,] He made the sounds of his voice to be closely<br>\
consecutive, or near together. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See 1.<br>\
4<br>\

هَزَجٌ (tropical:)  The twanging of a bow, on the archer&#39;s<br>\
loosing the string after drawing it; and of a lutestring: in the TA, i. q. رَنّةٌ: pl. أَهْزَاجٌ and pl. pl.<br>\
أَهَازِيجُ: or perhaps this latter is a pl. of which<br>\
the sing. is ↓ أُهْزُوجَةٌ, like as أَرَاجِيزُ is pl. of أُرْجُوزَةٌ:<br>\
and the twanging of a bow-string or lute-string<br>\
may be likened to an ode or a song of the metre<br>\
termed الهَزَج, which is perhaps, judging from<br>\
analogy, the proper signification of اهزوجة.]<br>\
لِلْعُودِ وَالقَوْسِ أَهَازِيجُ (tropical:)  [To the lute and the bow<br>\
there are twangings]. (A.) El-Kumeyt says,<br>\

لَمْ يَعِبْ رَبُّهَا وَلَا النَّاسُ مِنْهَا<br>\
غَيْرَ إِنْذَارِهَا عَلَيْهِ الحَمِيرَا<br>\
بِأَهَازِيجَ مِنْ أَغَانِيِّهَا الجُشِ<br>\
وَإِتْبَاعِهَا النَّحِيبَ الزَّفِيرَا<br>\
[Neither its owner nor the people imputed a fault<br>\
to any of its properties, except its warning the<br>\
(wild) asses of his presence by the twangings of<br>\
its harsh singings, and its causing a groaning<br>\
sound to follow the loud, or prolonged, wailing].<br>\

الهَزَجٌ The name of a certain kind of metre of<br>\

the measure مَفَاعِيلُنْ: originally of six feet, like<br>\
the رَجَز and the رَمَل, in each of which, [as in the<br>\
هَزَج,] each foot consists of one element of the<br>\
kind termed وَتِدٌ مَجْمُوعٌ, and of two elements<br>\
