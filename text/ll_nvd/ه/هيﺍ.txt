هَآءَ, aor. يَهَآءُ and يَهِيْءُ, (K; the latter not of<br>\
respectable authority, Lh;) inf. n. هَيْئَةٌ, He was,<br>\
or became, of good, or goodly, form or appearance,<br>\
or other properties denoted by the term هَيْئَة, q. v.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [هَيُؤَ, accord. to the K, signifies the<br>\
same: but see below.] ―<br>\
-b3-  هَيُؤَ, accord. to IHsh<br>\
and others, the only verb of this form whose<br>\
medial radical letter is ى: (MF:) accord. to the<br>\
K, syn. with هَآءَ, in a sense indicated above:<br>\
but IJ states that it has a superlative sense;<br>\
that it is to be classed with قَضُوَ “ excellent [or<br>\
how excellent (see بَطُؤَ voce بُطَآنَ)] is he in his<br>\
judging! ” and رَمُوَ “ excellent [or how excellent]<br>\
is he in his throwing, or shooting! ” [wherefore<br>\
it signifies Excellent, or how excellent, is he in his<br>\
form or appearance! &amp;c.;] and that it is, like<br>\
قَضُوَ [and رَمُوَ], invariable [as to person, tense,<br>\
and mood]. He observes that, as a verb of the<br>\
measure فَعُلَ is formed from one whose final<br>\
radical letter is ى, [as قَضُوَ and رَمُوَ from قَضَى<br>\
and رَمَى,] so is this formed on the same measure<br>\
from a verb whose medial radical letter is ى:<br>\
and that it is invariable [as to person, tense, and<br>\
mood,] because of its resemblance, in its superlative sense, to the class of verbs of wonder, and<br>\
to نِعْمَ and بِئْسَ. He further remarks, that they<br>\
[the Arabs] have abstained from forming a verb<br>\
on the measure فَعُلَ [variable as to person, tense,<br>\
and mood,] from one whose medial radical letter<br>\
is ى, fearing to make what is difficult to pronounce still more so; for in that case they would<br>\
be obliged to say أَبُوعُ بُعْتُ, and بُوعَا; and, as<br>\
would also happen if a variable verb of the same<br>\
measure were formed from one whose final<br>\
radical letter is ى, the change of ى into و, which<br>\
is more difficult to pronounce, would thus become<br>\
frequent. (TA.) ―<br>\

verbal noun, signifying Attend! (تَنَبَّهْ); like صَهْ,<br>\

[Come now! O, give me to drink, before the<br>\

indeclinable, with a vowel for its termination<br>\

letters, and with fet-hah as the final vowel<br>\
because it is more easy of pronunciation than<br>\
the others in this case. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
