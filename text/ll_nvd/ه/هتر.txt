هَتَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
هَتِرَ, (K, TA,) like يَضْرِبُ, (TA [in<br>\
the CK, ??, but this is evidently a mistake,]) It<br>\
(old age, K, TA, and disease and grief, TA),<br>\
made him to be such as is called مُهْتَرٌ; [i. e.,<br>\
made him to lose his reason, or intellect: or to be<br>\
addicted to, or fond of, speaking of a thing:<br>\
which latter signification seems to be particularly indicated in the lexicon from which this<br>\
is taken; but the former seems the more appropriate.] (K.)<br>\
3<br>\
هاترهُ, [inf. n. مُهَاتَرَةٌ and هِتَارٌ,] He encountered him with mutual reviling, saying what was<br>\
false: (K, * TA:) so says IAmb, on the<br>\
authority of AZ; but, says Th, accord. to others,<br>\
المُهَاتَرَةُ signifies the saying [that] whereof one<br>\
part contradicts, or annuls, another: and hence<br>\
one says, دَعِ الهِتَارَ [leave the saying that whereof<br>\
one part contradicts another]. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أُهْتِرَ He became disordered in his intellect:<br>\
(A, TA:) or he became so by reason of old age:<br>\
(S:) or he lost his reason from old age, (AZ,<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd, K,) as also ↓ إِسْتَهْتَرَ, (AZ, TA,) or<br>\
from disease, or grief; as also أَهْتَرَ. (K.) See<br>\
also 10, in two places.<br>\
5<br>\
تهتّر He was, or became, stupid, and<br>\
ignorant. (K: but only the inf. n. is there<br>\
mentioned.)<br>\
6<br>\
تهاترا They accused each other falsely. (S,<br>\
A, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, تهاترت<br>\
البَيِّنَاتُ, (Msb,) and الشَّهَادَاتُ, (A, Mgh,) The<br>\
testimonies, or evidences, became null: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) or belied one another. (A.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَهْتَرَ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  He was, or became,<br>\
much given to false, or vain, sayings, or actions.<br>\
(TA [but this seems rather to be أُسْتُهْتِرَ: see its<br>\
part. n., below.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  He followed his own<br>\
natural desire, not caring what he did. (Msb<br>\
[but this also seems to be in the pass. form.]) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
أُسْتُهْتِرَ بِكَذَا (tropical:)  He became addicted to, or fond of,<br>\
such a thing, (K, TA,) not talking of any other<br>\
thing, (TA,) nor caring what was done to him,<br>\
(K, TA,) nor how he was reviled: (K:) he<br>\
became addicted to, or fond of, such a thing, not<br>\
talking of, nor doing, any other thing: and he<br>\
became fascinated by such a thing, and lost his<br>\
reason on account of it, and his strong determination became turned towards it, so that he<br>\
talked much and vainly respecting it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
إِسْتَهْتَرَ بِفُلَانَةَ, [or أُسْتُهْتِرَ,] and بِهَا ↓ أَهْتَرَ, [or أُهْتِرَ,]<br>\
(tropical:)  He [became attached, or devoted, to such a<br>\
woman so that he] cared not what was said of<br>\
him on her account, nor how he was reviled:<br>\
(A, TA:) and ↓ أُهْتِرَ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  he became<br>\
addicted or given to, or fond of, speaking of a<br>\
thing. (K.)<br>\
هُتْرٌ The loss of reason from old age or disease<br>\
or grief. (K.)<br>\
هِتْرٌ An error in speech. (S, A, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K.) You say, جَآءَ بِهِتْرٍ مِنَ القَوْلِ He uttered<br>\
an error of speech. (A.) And ↓ هِتْرٌ هَاتِرٌ A<br>\
great error of speech. (S, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  A falsehood;<br>\

هَاتِرٌ: see هِتْرٌ.<br>\
تَهَاتِرُ Testimonies, or evidences, that belie one<br>\
another: as though pl. of تَهْتَرٌ: (K:) or any<br>\
evidences, or testimonies, that are not legal proofs<br>\
(Mgh [but in my copy of that work written<br>\
تَهاتُر.])<br>\
مُهْتَرٌ Disordered in his intellect, (S,) or having<br>\
lost his reason, (AZ, A&#39;Obeyd, K,) from old age.<br>\
(AZ, A&#39;Obeyd, S, K,) or from disease, or<br>\
grief: (K:) if from أَهْتَرَ, it is anomalous. (K,<br>\
TA,) like مُحْصَنٌ, &amp;c. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  Addicted or<br>\
given to, or fond of, speaking of a thing (K.)<br>\
See also مُسْتَهْتَرٌ.<br>\

or actions: (K:) or one who says what is false<br>\
or erroneous: or one who cares not what is said<br>\
of him, nor how he is reviled: or (assumed tropical:)  attached, or<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  مُسْتَهْتَرٌ بِشَىْءٍ (tropical:)  Addicted to, or fond of, a<br>\
thing, (K, TA,) or fascinated by it, (A,) not<br>\
