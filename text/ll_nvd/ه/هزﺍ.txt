هَزَأَ مِنْهُ, (K,) and بِهِ; (S, K;) and هَزِئَ<br>\
(S, K) followed by منه and به; (Akh, S;) but<br>\
accord. to Yoo, we should say هزئ به only;<br>\
not منه; (TA;) aor.<br>\
هَزَاَ, inf. n. هُزْءٌ and هُزُؤٌ (S, K)<br>\
and هُزُوْءٌ (TA) and مَهْزَأَةٌ; (S, K;) and به ↓ تهزّأ,<br>\
(AZ, S, K,) and به ↓ استهزأ; (S, K;) He<br>\
mocked at, scoffed at, laughed at, derided, or<br>\
ridiculed, him. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The most approved<br>\
reading of ↓ مُسْتَهْزِئُونَ in the Kur, ii. 13, is with<br>\
the ء fully pronounced: some alleviate it: and<br>\
some read مُسْتَهْزِيُرنَ: and some مُسْتَهْزُونَ; (but<br>\
this pronunciation is of weak authority;) and<br>\
say إِسْتَهْزَيْتُ for إِسْتَهْزَأْتُ. (Zj.) ―<br>\
-b3-  السَّرَابُ يَهْزَأُ<br>\
بِالرَّكْبِ (tropical:)  [The mirage mocks the company of<br>\
riders]. (A.)<br>\

لَهَا عُكَنْ تَرُدُّ النَّبْلَ خَنْسًا<br>\
وَتَهْزَأُ بِالْمَعَابِلِ وَالقِطَاعِ<br>\
[It has creases that repel the arrows, making<br>\
them to recede, and break the broad and long<br>\
arrow-heads, and those which are small and<br>\
broad]. The ب in بالمعابل is redundant. This is<br>\
the opinion of the lexicologists, except ISd, who<br>\
thinks that this is an error, and that تهزأ here<br>\
means “ mocks. ” (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  هَزَأَ إِبِلَهُ (K; but it is<br>\
thought that this may be a mistake for هَرَأَ, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. هَزْءٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اهزأ ها; (K;) He<br>\
killed his camels with cold. IAar says, that<br>\
اهزأهُ البَرْدُ and اهرأهُ both signify The cold killed<br>\

spot; i. e. unexpectedly, or suddenly: (Z:) improperly objected against by Ibn-Es-Sáïgh.<br>\
(&#39;Ináyeh, MF.)<br>\

اهزأ He entered upon the time of severe cold.<br>\
(K.) See also اهرأ, which is the word commonly<br>\
known. (TA.) ―<br>\
