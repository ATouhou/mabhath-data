substance,” of a garment, &amp;c.: [such is the<br>\

this is what is generally meant by خمل] and<br>\
this is mostly in what are called قَطَائِفُ: (MF:)<br>\
or the extremity of a garment, &amp;c. next [the part<br>\
called] the طُرَّة: (TA:) or the هدبة of a garment,<br>\

the fist word, (هُدْبٌ or هُدُبٌ,) with ة (K:)<br>\
so too of هيدب, (TA,) [and of هدّاب]. The pl.<br>\
of هُدْبَةٌ is هُدَبٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  هُدْبٌ, (K,) or هُدْبُ<br>\
العَيْنِ, (S,) and ↓ هُدُبٌ, (K,) which is a dial<br>\
form of هدب, (TA,) coll. gen. ns., The eyelashes; the hairs that grow upon the edges<br>\
of the eyelids: (S, K:) n. un. with ة: (K:)<br>\
pl. أَهْدَابٌ. (Msb.)<br>\

plant that are not وَرَق but that have the place<br>\
of وَرَق. (AHn, K:) or any وَرَق that have not<br>\

أَرْطَى and طَرْفَآء; (S:) as also ↓ هُدَّابٌ, (S, K,)<br>\
both of which are sell gen. ns., of which the as,<br>\
an. are with ة: pl. أَهْدَابٌ, (K,) which is a<br>\
regular pl. of هَدَبٌ (TA;) and ↓ هُدَّابٌ: (K,<br>\
accord. to the TA: but in a MS. copy, هُدَّابَةٌ;<br>\
and in the CK, هَدَّابَةٌ,) but in the M, هُدَّابٌ is<br>\
said to be a noun signifying the هُدْب of a<br>\
garment, &amp;c., and the هَدَب of the أَرْطَى<br>\
(TA) Az says, that عَبَلٌ is precisely the same<br>\
as هَدَبٌ (TA.) ―<br>\

-b3-  Also,<br>\

shoulder-blades. but ISd, who mentions this,<br>\
denies its correctness. (TA.)<br>\

held in high estimation among the Arabs, and<br>\
are distinguished as belonging to different tents,<br>\
or house. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الهُدبُ (assumed tropical:)  The lion. (K.)<br>\
But accord. to Lth, ↓ أَهْدَبُ, as an epithet applied<br>\
to felt and the like, signifies (assumed tropical:)  Having long nap,<br>\
or villous substance (TA,) and as an epithet<br>\
applied to a lion, accord. to the A, it signifies<br>\
(tropical:)  Having long shag [or shaggy hair]: (TA:)<br>\
whence it is seen that the correct word [applied<br>\
to the lion [أَهْدَبُ, q. v.] and هَدِبٌ. (TA.)<br>\
هُدُبٌ and هُدُبَةٌ: see هُدْبٌ.<br>\
هُدْبَةٌ (TA) and ↓ هُدَبَةٌ (Kr, K) A certain<br>\
bird: (K:) or a small dust-coloured bird, resembling the هَامَة. accept in being smaller than this<br>\
latter. (L.) El-Jáhidh says, The Arabs have<br>\
not a name for that [kind of bird] which sees<br>\
not in the night: it is that which is called شبكور<br>\
[a Persian word, written شَبْكُورْ], more frequently<br>\
than هدبة. (A.)<br>\

هِنْدَبٌ (S, K, a word of a rare measure, TA,)<br>\
and ↓ هِنْدَبَاءٌ (K: [but it is not there said<br>\
whether it be imperfectly or perfectly declinable:<br>\
accord. to Ibn-Buzurj, as mentioned in the TA,<br>\
it is fem., and therefore imperfectly decl.: but<br>\
from the ns. an. given below, it appears to be<br>\
masc., and perfectly decl.: probably, therefore,<br>\
all the forms of the word ending with long<br>\
or short alif may be correctly pronounced without,<br>\
and with, tenween:]) and ↓ هِنْدَبَّى (ISk, S, Msb)<br>\
and هِنْدِبَاءٌ and هِنْدِبًى; (Az, S, K, Msb;) but<br>\
the word which is used by most of the Arabs of<br>\
the desert is the first: (Az;) IKt only mentions<br>\
the third form: (Msb:) also ↓ هَنْدَبَاةٌ, (S;) or<br>\
[هندبى and هندباء are coll. gen. ns., and] هِنَدَبَاةٌ<br>\
is a n. un., (AHn, K,) as also هندباءة: (AHn,<br>\

crude;) (TA;) [lichorium, intybus and endivia;<br>\
wild and garden-succory, and endive: also called<br>\
in the present day شكُوريَة] a plant of middling<br>\
temperament, (مُعْتَدِلَةٌ,) useful for the stomach<br>\
and the liver and the spleen, when eaten: and for<br>\
the sting of a scorpion, when applied externally,<br>\
with its roots: he who cooks it errs more than<br>\
he who washes it [and so uses it]. (K.) F<br>\
mentions the names of this plant in aro. هندب,<br>\
as though the ن were a radical letter, which noone asserts it to be: J [and others], in art.<br>\
هدب. (TA.)<br>\

appertenances, of a flower. ―<br>\
-b3-  هَيْدَبٌ; (tropical:)  A (??)<br>\
or clouds, hanging down, (K,) approaching [the<br>\
earth], like the هُدْب [or unwoven end or<br>\
extremity,] of a (قَطِيفَة: (TA:) or the هيدب of<br>\
a cloud is its ذَيْل [or skirt]. (K:) or what<br>\
hangs down, of it, like the unwoven and, or<br>\

-b4-<br>\
هَيْدَبٌ (tropical:)  A pendulous (or flabby. TA,) pubes of<br>\
a woman: (K:) likened to the هيدب of a cloud<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  هَيْدَبٌ (tropical:)  Tears flowing in a continued<br>\
succession. (K.) On the authority of Lth, who<br>\
cites the following verse:<br>\
بِدَمْعٍ ذِى حَرَارَاتٍ<br>\
عَلَى الخَدَّيْنِ ذِى هَيْدَبْ<br>\
[With hot tears upon the cheeks, flowing in a<br>\
continued succession]. But it is said in the L,<br>\
I have not heard هيدب used as an epithet<br>\
applied to rain falling continuously, aor. as an<br>\
epithet applied to tears; and the verse which<br>\
Lth adduces as an authority is forged. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
هَيْدَبٌ (S, K) and ↓ هُدُبٌّ and ↓ هُدَّابٌ (K)<br>\
Impotent in speech or actions; syn. عَيِىٌّ; (in<br>\

or talk; of many words. (K.) App. from the<br>\
هَيْدَب of a cloud. (TA.)<br>\
أَهْدَبُ A man having long, or large, eyelashes.<br>\
(K.) Lth explains it by the words طَوِيلُ أَشْفَارِ<br>\
العَيْنِ كَثِيرُهَا; [and J in a similar manner;] but<br>\
Az disapproves of this expression, because اشفار<br>\
العين signifies “ the edges of the eyelids,”<br>\
whence the eyelashes grow: (TA:) أَهْدَبُ الأَشْفَارِ,<br>\
and الاشفار ↓ هَدِبُ, [the same;] having long eyelashes. (TA.) عَيْنٌ هَدْبَاءُ An eye having long<br>\

the kind of stuff called دِمَقْسٌ. (TA.)<br>\
