K,) as, for instance, a walnut, (A, TA,) or<br>\
other thing, (S, TA,) in the hand; (S, A, TA,)<br>\
and a man&#39;s head; (S, A, TA;) and a spearshaft, with the مَهَامِز, to straighten it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
He pushed, impelled, or repelled, him or it, (S,<br>\
K, TA,) meaning anything; as also لَمَزَهُ &amp;c.<br>\
(TA.) You say, هَمَزَتْهُ إِلَيْهِ الحَاجَةُ Want impelled, or drove, him to him or it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He<br>\
struck, or beat, him; (S, K, TA;) as also لَمَزَهُ<br>\
&amp;c. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He goaded, or spurred, him;<br>\
(K, TA;) he urged him on (namely a horse)<br>\
with the مِهْمَاز, to make him run. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
He bit him. (IAar, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  He broke it. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  (tropical:)  He (the devil) suggested evil to his mind.<br>\
(JK, A, TA.) You say, أَعُوذُ بِاللّٰهِ مِنْ هَمْزِهِ;<br>\
and مِنْ هَمَزَاتِ الشَّيَاطِينِ; (tropical:)  I seek refuge in<br>\
God from his [the devil&#39;s] evil suggestion; and<br>\
from the evil suggestions of the devils. (A.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
(tropical:)  He blamed, upbraided, or reproached, him; he<br>\
found fault with him; syn. of the inf. n. عَيْبٌ,<br>\
(Fr, in TA, art. لمز; and IAar, in TA, in the<br>\
present art.) as also لَمْزٌ: (Fr, in TA, art. لمز;<br>\
and S,) or he spoke evil of him, or spoke of him<br>\
in a manner that he disliked, mentioning vices or<br>\
faults as chargeable to him, behind his back,<br>\
though it might be with truth; syn. إِغْتَابَهُ فِى<br>\
غَيْبَتِهِ: (Msb:) and [so] هَمَزَهُ فِى قَفَاهُ he backbit him. (JK, A.)<br>\
-A4-  هَمَزَ الحَرْفَ, (S, O,) or<br>\
الكَلِمَةَ, aor.<br>\
هَمِزَ, inf. n. هَمْزٌ, (Msb,) [He pronounced the word with the sound termed هَمْز, or<br>\
هَمْزَة, of which the sign is ء,] is from هَمَزَهُ in the<br>\
first of the senses explained above; (S, Msb,)<br>\
because what is termed هَمْز in speech, (S,) or<br>\
هَمْزَة, (Kh, TA,) [i. e. the sound so called,] is<br>\
[as it were] pressed, or squeezed, (Kh, S, TA,)<br>\
from its place of utterance [by a sudden emission<br>\
of the voice forced out after a compression of<br>\
the passage whereby it has been stopped]. (Kh,<br>\
TA.) It was said to an Arab of the desert,<br>\
أَتَهْمِزُ الفَأْرَةَ, [meaning Dost thou pronounce الفَأْرَة<br>\
with hemz, or hemzeh?] and he said, [understanding the words to mean dost thou squeeze the<br>\
rat, or mouse?] السِّنَّوْرُ يَهْمِزُهَا [The cat squeezes<br>\
it]. (S.) See هَمْزٌ, below. [And see also نَبَرَ.]<br>\
7<br>\
انهمز [quasi-pass. of هَمَزَهُ; It was pressed,<br>\
squeezed, or pinched: he was pushed, &amp;c. The<br>\
first of these significations is indicated, or implied, in the JK and the TA.] ―<br>\
-b2-  انهمز الحَرْفُ<br>\
[The word was pronounced with the sound termed<br>\
هَمْز, or هَمْزَة]. (S.)<br>\
هَمْزُ الشَّيْطَانِ was explained by Mohammad as<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  Madness, or insanity; syn. مُوتَةٌ, i. e.<br>\
جُنُونٌ; because it arises from the goading and<br>\
pressing or pinching of the devil. (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
K.) See 1; and see also هَمَزَات, voce هَمْزَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
هَمْزٌ, (S,) and هَمْزَةٌ, (Kh, TA,) [the former a gen.<br>\
n., and the latter the n. un.,] The sister of alif; one<br>\
of the letters of the alphabet; [written thus;] a<br>\
genuine word, old, heard [from the Arabs of<br>\
classical times], and well known; so called for a<br>\
reason mentioned above: see 1, last signification:<br>\
so says Kh; therefore no regard is due to what is<br>\
said in certain of the expositions of the Keshsháf,<br>\
that the term همزة thus used has not been heard<br>\
[from any of the Arabs of classical times], and<br>\
that its name is أَلْفٌ: (TA:) several persons<br>\
say, that the term همزة is mostly applied to the<br>\
movent [alif], and الف to the quiscent letter.<br>\
(MF, TA.) See the letter ا.<br>\
هَمْزَةٌ n. un. of هَمْزٌ, q. v. ―<br>\
-b2-  هَمَزَاتُ الشَّيَاطِينِ<br>\
(tropical:)  The vain suggestions of the devils, which they<br>\
inspire into the mind of a man. (S, TA.) See<br>\
also 1; and see هَمْزٌ.<br>\
هُمَزَةٌ i. q. غَمَّازٌ; (K;) i. e., (TA,) One who<br>\
blames, upbraids, reproaches, or finds fault with,<br>\
others, much, or habitually; (S, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ هَمَّازٌ (S, TA) and ↓ هَامِزٌ; (S, K;) and so<br>\
لُمَزَةٌ: (S, K, art. لمز:) [or rather] the first and<br>\
second are intensive epithets (TA) [but the third<br>\
is not intensive]: or one who backbites his<br>\
brother; as also ↓ هَمَّازٌ: (Lth, A, TA:) or one<br>\
who defames men (يَخْلُفُهُمْ مِنْ وَرَائِهِمْ وَبَأْكُلُ<br>\
لُحُومَهُمْ); and the action thus signified is like<br>\
غِيبَةٌ, and may be [by making signs] with the side<br>\
of the mouth, and with the eye, and with the<br>\
head; as also ↓ هَمَّازٌ: (TA:) or, conjointly with<br>\
لُمَزَةٌ, one who speaks evil of men, or backbites<br>\
them, and defames them: (Aboo-Is-hák, TA:)<br>\
or both together, one who goes about much, or<br>\
habitually, with calumny, or slander, separating<br>\
companions and exciting enmity between friends:<br>\
(Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, TA:) هُمَزَةٌ is applied to a man<br>\
and to a woman; (S, TA;) [like لَمُزَةٌ;] for its<br>\
ة is to denote intensiveness, and not the fem.<br>\
gender: (TA:) ↓ هُمَّازٌ [which is the pl. of هَامِزٌ]<br>\
signifies persons who blame, upbraid, reproach,<br>\
or find fault with, others behind their backs,<br>\
much, or habitually: (IAar, TA:) [or, more<br>\
correctly, it has not an intensive signification.]<br>\
