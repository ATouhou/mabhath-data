هيّت بِهِ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَهْيِيتٌ, (TA,) as<br>\
also هوّت, (S,) He cried out to him, and called<br>\
him, (S, K,) saying, هَيْتَ هَيْتَ; or saying يَاهْ يَاهْ,<br>\
which is a cry by which a pastor calls his companion from afar; or, accord. to AZ, saying<br>\
يَا هَيَا [or rather يَاهَيَاهْ: see art. يه]. (TA.)<br>\

هَات Give me: (K:) هَاتِ يَا رَجُلُ Give me,<br>\
O man: (T, S, M:) i. q. أَعْطِنِى: (T, S, M,<br>\
K:) to two men, هَاتِيَا: to a plurality of men,<br>\
هَاتُوا: to a woman, هَاتِى: to two women, هَاتِيَا:<br>\
to a plurality of women, هَاتِينَ: you say هَاتِ<br>\
لا هَاتَيْتَ [Give me: mayest thou not give (hereafter)! an imprecation, of the like of which there<br>\
are many examples]; and هَاتِ إِنْ كَانَتْ بِكَ<br>\
مُهَاتَاةٌ [Give me, if there be in thee (a disposition<br>\
for) giving]; and مَا أُهاتِيكَ [I do not give thee],<br>\
like as you say, مَا أُعَاطِيكَ; but you do not say<br>\
هَاتَيْتُ; nor do you use this verb in a prohibitive<br>\
manner: [it is used neither affirmatively nor<br>\
prohibitively:] accord. to Kh, هَاتِ is from اتَى,<br>\
aor. يُوتِى; the ا being changed into ه. (S.)<br>\
[But اتَى is of the measure أَفْعَلَ; and هَاتِ is<br>\
the imp. from the measure فَاعَلَ. See also art.<br>\
هتى, where it is mentioned again in the S<br>\
and K.]<br>\
هَيْتَ an exclamation denoting wonder: the<br>\
Arabs say, هَيْتَ لِلْحِلْمِ [What forbearing mildness, or clemency!] (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  هَيْتَ لَكَ, (Akh, S,<br>\
K, &amp;c.,) and هَيْتِ لك, (Akh, K,) and هَيْتَ لك,<br>\
(Akh, IB, K,) and the first letter is sometimes<br>\
with kesreh; (K;) as is related on the authority of<br>\
&#39;Alee, (TA,) [so that you say هِيتَ and هِيتِ and<br>\
هِيتُ, the first of which three forms is mentioned<br>\
by Fr, Akh, IB, and the third by Fr, IB; but<br>\
for the second I find no other authority than<br>\
that implied above;] of all which, the most<br>\
common is هَيْتَ لك, with fet-hah to the ه and<br>\
ت: (Zj:) هَيْتَ is of the dial. of Howrán, whence<br>\
it became introduced into Mekkeh; and هِيتَ,<br>\
of the dial. of El-Medeeneh: (Fr:) [imper.<br>\
verbal ns.] i. q. هَلُمَّ, Come! (Akh, S, L, K,) or<br>\
تَعَالَ the same, (Fr, Ks,) or أَقْبِلْ, the same, or<br>\
Come forward! (L.) It occurs in the Kur,<br>\
xii. 23; where it is commonly read هَيْتَ لَكَ;<br>\
(Zj;) but &#39;Alee and Ibn-&#39;Abbás are said to have<br>\
read هِئْتُ لَكَ, with hemzeh. [See art. هيأ.] (TA.)<br>\
هَيْتَ is itself invariable whether used to denote<br>\
the sing. or pl. or fem. or masc.; but the difference of number is observed in what follows<br>\
it; for you say هَيْتَ لَكُمَا [Come ye two!] and<br>\
هَيْتَ لَكُنَّ [Come ye women! &amp;c.]: (S:) you<br>\
also say simply هَيْتَ [Come!] and this is also<br>\
said to signify Hasten! and Set forth journeying through the land, or earth. (TA.) Authorities differ respecting this word; whether it be<br>\
Arabic or arabicized; and whether it be a noun<br>\
or a verb; &amp;c. Accord. to AZ, as related by<br>\
Az, هيت لك is arabicized in the Kur, from the<br>\
Hebrew هيتا كخ [app. a mistake for هيتا كخ,<br>\
which I suppose to be meant for ??<br>\
“ Now, come! ” occurring in Gen. xxxi. 44].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
هَيْتَ هَيْتَ: see 2.<br>\
هِيتٌ A low, or depressed, piece of ground:<br>\
(K:) a piece of ground having a low, or depressed, bottom: (TA:) i. q. هُوَّةٌ and هُوتَةُ.<br>\
(IAar.)<br>\
هِيتَاءٌ, and هِيتَاه: see art. هوت.<br>\
هَيَّاتٌ [Clamorous; calling out often, or much].<br>\
