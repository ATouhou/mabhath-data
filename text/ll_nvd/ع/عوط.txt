عَاطَتْ, aor. تَعُوطُ, (S, K,) and تَعِيطُ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. عَوْطٌ (M, TA) and, accord. to some,<br>\
↓ عُوطَطٌ, which others hold to be a pl. of عَائِطٌ,<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, S,) but Sb holds it to be a subst.<br>\
having the sense of an inf. n., (TA,) and عَيْطٌ and<br>\
عِيَاطٌ, (K,) She (a camel) did not conceive in the<br>\
first year after having been covered: nor in the<br>\
next following year: (S:) or i. q. ↓ اعتاطت and<br>\
↓ تعوّطت and ↓ تعيّطت, (K,) which (or the first<br>\
and second of which, IDrd, O) signify she (a<br>\
camel, IDrd, S, M, A, O, K, and a woman, A, K)<br>\
did not conceive for several years, (Lth, IDrd, S, O,<br>\
K,) without being barren; (Lth, K;) and sometimes<br>\
this is caused by the abundance of her fat: (Lth,<br>\
S:) the last three verbs also signify, (the first<br>\
of them accord. to the K, and the other two also<br>\
accord to the TA,) she (a camel) did not conceive,<br>\
having been covered; (K, TA;) or although her<br>\
womb had attained to maturity. (TA. [See also<br>\
اعتاصت, in art. عوص.]) ―<br>\

الأَذْهَانُ ↓ هٰذَا زَمَانٌ عَقُمَتْ فِيهِ القَرَائِحُ وَاعْتَاطَتِ<br>\
اللَّوَاقِحُ (assumed tropical:)  [This is a time in which the powers of<br>\
elicitation have become unproductive, and the pregnant intellectual faculties have become fruitless].<br>\
(A, TA.) [Hence also,] الأَمْرُ ↓ اعتاط (assumed tropical:)  The affair<br>\
was, or became, difficult; or difficult and intricate; or impossible; i. q. اعتاص. (S, O.)<br>\

عُوطَةٌ The quality denoted by the epithet عَائِطٌ,<br>\
in a she-camel; as also ↓ عُوطَطٌ and ↓ عُوطُطٌ and<br>\
عُيْطَطٌ [perhaps a mistake for عِيطَطٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
عُوطَطٌ and عُوطُطٌ: see 1, and عُوطَةٌ, and عَائِطٌ,<br>\
this last in two places.<br>\
عَائِطٌ A she-camel not conceiving in the first<br>\
year after having been covered: (Ks, Az, S, O:)<br>\
or a she-camel, (Lth, K,) and a woman, (K,) not<br>\
conceiving for several years, without being barren;<br>\
(Lth, K;) as also ↓ مُعْتَاطٌ: (Lth, IAth, O, * TA:)<br>\
and a she-camel not conceiving when covered;<br>\
(K;) as also ↓ مُعْتَاطٌ, or ↓ مُعْتَاطَةٌ: (accord. to<br>\
different copies of the K:) or not conceiving when<br>\
her womb has attained to maturity: (TA:) ↓ مُعْتَاطٌ<br>\
is also applied to a ewe or she-goat, as meaning<br>\
not conceiving, by reason of the abundance of her<br>\
fat; (IAth;) and occurs in a trad., so applied,<br>\
(S, IAth,) and expl. as signifying اَلَّتِى لَمْ تَلِدْ<br>\
وَقَدْ حَانَ وِلَادُهَا; but by this is app. meant that<br>\
has not conceived, although the time for her conceiving has come: (IAth:) the pl. of عَائِطٌ is عُوطٌ,<br>\
(Ks, S, M, O, K,) which is also applied to women,<br>\
and she-goats, (M,) and عِيطٌ (Ks, S, O, K) and<br>\
عُيَّطٌ (M, O, K) and عَوَائِطُ (TA) and ↓ عُوطَطٌ<br>\
[which is irregular, like حُولَلٌ,] (Ks, S, O, K)<br>\
and عَوْطَطٌ (accord. to the CK) and عُوطُطٌ, (K,)<br>\
but this is a dial. var. of عُوطَطٌ accord. to those<br>\
who assert it to be an inf. n., (As, O, TA,) for<br>\
some assert this last to be an inf. n., not a pl.,<br>\
and in like manner حُولَلٌ, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, O,) but<br>\
Sb holds it to be a subst. in the sense of an inf. n.,<br>\
originally عُيْطَطٌ. (L, TA.) عَائِطُ عِيطٍ and عَائِطُ<br>\
عُوطٍ and ↓ عَائِطُ عُوطَطٍ (S, O, K) have an intensive<br>\
signification, (K,) Not conceiving in the first year<br>\
after having been covered, nor in the next following year; like حَائِلُ حُولٍ and حَائِلُ حُولَلٍ. (S,<br>\
O.) [عِيطٌ is also pl. of أَعْيَطُ, which see in<br>\
art. عيط.]<br>\
مُعْتَاطٌ, and with ة: see عَائِطٌ, in four places.<br>\
The author of the K has confounded the words<br>\
belonging to this art. with those belonging to art.<br>\
عيط. (TA.)<br>\
