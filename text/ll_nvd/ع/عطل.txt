عَطِلَتْ, [in my copy of the Msb said to be<br>\
of the class of قتل, perhaps a mistranscription for<br>\
قَبِلَ, but see what is said below of عَطَلَ as syn.<br>\
with بَطَلَ, from which it may be inferred that<br>\
عَطَلَتْ is correct in the sense here following as<br>\
well as عَطِلَتْ,] said of a woman, [aor.<br>\
عَطَلَ,] inf. n.<br>\
عَطَلٌ (S, O, K) and عُطُولٌ; (O, K;) and ↓ تعطّلت;<br>\
(S, O, K;) She had not upon her any women&#39;s<br>\
ornaments; (K, TA;) and wore not any ornature,<br>\
or decoration: (TA:) or her neck was destitute of<br>\
necklaces or the like; (S, O;) as also ↓ استعطلت:<br>\
(Har p. 268:) accord. to Er-Rághib, العَطَلُ signifies the being destitute of ornature, or decoration.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And sometimes العَطَلُ is used [for<br>\
العَطَلُ مِنْ شَىْءِ] as meaning The being destitute<br>\
of a thing; though primarily relating to women&#39;s<br>\
ornaments. (S, O.) One says, عَطِلَ مِنَ المَالِ He<br>\
(a man, O) was, or became, destitute [of property],<br>\
and مِنَ الأَدَبِ [of discipline, or good qualities and<br>\
attributes, of the mind, &amp;c.]. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
it signifies also The being destitute of occupation.<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA.) One says, عَطَلَ الأَجِيرُ, aor.<br>\
عَطُلَ,<br>\
like بَطَلَ, aor.<br>\
عَطُلَ, in measure and in meaning [i. e.<br>\
The hired man was without occupation: though<br>\
it seems that in this sense also, accord. to general<br>\
usage, the verb is عَطِلَ, aor.<br>\
عَطَلَ]. (Msb. [See also 5.])<br>\
And عطلت الإِبِلُ The camels were without a pastor to tend them. (Msb. [The context there app.<br>\
indicates that the verb in this case, likewise, is<br>\
with fet-h to the ط; but I believe it to be more<br>\
correctly عَطِلَت.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَطِلَ, (O, K,) with<br>\
kesr [to the ط], (O,) [i. e.] like فَرِحَ, (K,) signifies also He was, or became, large in the body.<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\

abode, and the like. (TA.) And The leaving a<br>\
thing untended, unminded, or neglected. (K, TA.<br>\
[ضِياعًا in the CK is a mistake for ضَيَاعًا.]) One<br>\
says of the frontier of a hostile country, عُطِّلَ,<br>\
meaning It was left without any to defend it.<br>\
(TA.) And of subjects one says, عُطِّلُوا, meaning They were left without any one to govern them.<br>\
(TA.) One says also, عَطَّلْتُ الإِبِلَ, inf. n. as<br>\
above, I left the camels without a pastor to tend<br>\
them. (Msb.) وَإِذَا العِشَارُ عُطِّلَتْ, in the Kur<br>\
lxxxi. 4, means And when the pregnant camels<br>\
[ten months gone with young] shall be left without<br>\
a pastor, or without being milked [?]; (Jel;) by<br>\
reason of the terrors of the hour; (O;) i. e. by<br>\
men&#39;s having their minds occupied by the terrors<br>\
of the day of resurrection. (TA.) And عُطِّلَتْ<br>\
is said of lands of seed-produce as meaning They<br>\
were left uncultivated. (TA.) ―<br>\

or use; free therefrom; unoccupied; or unemployed]. (S, O, K.) One says, عَطَّلْتُ الأَجِيرَ I<br>\
made the hired man to be unoccupied. (Msb.)<br>\
And عطّل الخَيْلَ مِنَ الغَزْوِ (S and K in art. بهو)<br>\

he did not go to war upon the horses. (TA in<br>\
