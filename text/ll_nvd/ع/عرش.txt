عَرِشَ, inf. n. عَرْشٌ, (TA,) He struck such a<br>\

-b3-  عرّش العَرْشَ He<br>\

mounted (S, O, K) upon the عَرِيش, (O, K,) or,<br>\
as in the Mufradát, upon their عريش, (TA,) or<br>\
upon the عِرَاش [which may be a pl. of عَرِيشٌ,<br>\
like عَرَائِشُ, or perhaps it is a mistranscription for<br>\
this last word]: (S: so in two copies:) and in<br>\
like manner, اعترش العِنَبُ العَرِيشَ: (L, TA:<br>\
[expl. by عَلَاهُ عَلَى العِرَاشِ, which seems to be a<br>\
mistake for عَلَا عَلَى العِرِيشِ:]) and اعترشت<br>\
القُضْبَانُ عَلَى العَرِيشِ The branches, or shoots,<br>\
mounted upon the عريش. (A, TA.)<br>\
عَرْشٌ A booth, or shed, or thing constructed for<br>\
shade, (مِظَلَّةٌ,) mostly made of canes, or reeds;<br>\
(K;) and sometimes, (TA,) made of palm-sticks,<br>\
over which is thrown ثُمَام [a species of panic<br>\
grass]; (Mgh, TA:) as described by Az, on the<br>\
authority of the Arabs; (TA;) and such is<br>\
meant by the عَرْش of Moses: (Mgh:) a thing<br>\
resembling a house, or tent, made of palm-sticks,<br>\
over which is put ثُمَام; as also ↓ عَرِيشٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
a booth, or shed, syn. خَيْمَةٌ, (K, TA,) made of<br>\
wood and ثمان; (TA;) as also ↓ عَرِيشٌ; (S, A, *<br>\
O, K;) and such is meant by the ↓ عَرِيش of<br>\
Moses; (A;) and sometimes the ↓ عَرِيش was<br>\
made of palm-sticks, with ثُمَام thrown over them:<br>\
(TA:) both signify a thing, (S, O,) or a house,<br>\
or the like, (K,) used for shade: (S, O, K:) pl.<br>\
of the former, عُرُوشٌ (ISd, Mgh, Msb, K) and<br>\
عُرُشٌ and أَعْرَاشٌ [which is a pl. of pauc.] and<br>\
عِرَشَةٌ: (K:) or عُرُشٌ is pl. of ↓ عَرِيشٌ, (S, ISd,<br>\
O, Msb,) not of عَرْشٌ: (ISd:) or it is also pl.<br>\
of ↓ عَرِيشٌ: (K:) and عُرُوشٌ is also a pl. of<br>\
↓ عُرْشٌ, which is a pl. of ↓ عَرِيشٌ. (L.) Hence<br>\
The houses of Mekkeh, (S, A, Mgh, O, Msb,) in<br>\
which the needy of its inhabitants dwelt, (Mgh,)<br>\
or its ancient houses, (K,) were called العُرُوشُ,<br>\
(S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) and العُرُشُ, (S, Msb,)<br>\
and ↓ العُرْشُ; (O, K;) because they were of<br>\
poles, or sticks, set up, and shaded over: (S, O,<br>\
Msb:) or Mekkeh itself was called ↓ العُرْشُ:<br>\
(Az, O, L, K:) or it was called العَرْشُ, with fet-h,<br>\
and ↓ العَرِيشُ: (Az, L, K:) and its houses were<br>\
called ↓ العُرْشُ, and العُرُوشُ. (K.) And hence,<br>\
(S, O, Msb,) the saying in a trad., (S, O,) i. e.,<br>\
the saying of Saad, (K, TA,) when he heard that<br>\
Mo&#39;áwiyeh forbade the performing conjointly the<br>\
greater and minor pilgrimages, (TA,) تَمَتَّعْنَا مَعَ<br>\
رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ وَفُلَانٌ كَافِرٌ بِالْعُرُشِ,<br>\
(S, O, K, *) or بِالْعُرُوشِ, (S, TA,) i. e., [We performed conjointly the greater and minor pilgrimages with the Apostle of God, (God bless and<br>\
save him,)] when such a one, meaning Mo&#39;áwiyeh,<br>\
was abiding (O, L, K) in his state of unbelief,<br>\
(L,) in Mekkeh; (L, K;) i. e. in the houses<br>\
thereof: (O, L:) or, as some say, was hiding<br>\
himself in the houses of Mekkeh. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A house<br>\
[in an absolute sense]; a dwelling, or place of<br>\
abode: (Kr, TA:) pl. عُرُشٌ (TA) [and عُرُوشٌ].<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  A [building of the kind called] قَصْر. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
The wood upon which stands the drawer of water:<br>\
(K:) or a structure of wood built at the head of<br>\
the well, forming a shade: [pl. عُرُوشٌ:] when the<br>\
props are pulled away, the عُرُوش fall down.<br>\
(TA.) [عَرْشٌ in relation to a well has also<br>\
another meaning; which see below.] ―<br>\
-b5-  The<br>\
wooden thing [or trellis] which serves for the propping of a grape-vine. (TA.) [But this is more<br>\
commonly called عَرِيشٌ, q. v.] ―<br>\
-b6-  The roof of a<br>\
house or the like: (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K:) pl.<br>\
عُرُوشٌ. (A.) So in a trad., where a lamp is<br>\
mentioned as suspended to the عرش: (O, TA:)<br>\
and in another, in which a man relates that he<br>\
used, when upon his عرش, to hear the Prophet&#39;s<br>\
reciting [of the Kur-án]. (TA.) And so it has<br>\
been expl. as occurring in the phrase of the Kur<br>\
[ii. 261 and xxii. 44], خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا Having<br>\
fallen down upon its roofs: meaning that its<br>\
walls were standing when their roofs had become<br>\
demolished and had fallen to the foundations, and<br>\
the walls fell down upon the roofs demolished<br>\
before them: (O, TA:) but some consider على<br>\
as here meaning عَنْ [from]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence,<br>\
app.,] العَرْشُ is applied to The عَرْش of God,<br>\
which is not definable: (A, K:) I&#39;Ab is related<br>\
to have said that the كُرْسِىّ is the place of the<br>\
feet and the عَرْش is immeasurable: and it is said<br>\
in the Mufradát of Er-Rághib that the عَرْش of<br>\
God is one of the things which mankind know not<br>\
in reality, but only by name; and it is not as the<br>\
imaginations of the vulgar hold it to be; [namely,<br>\
the throne of God;] for were it so, it would be a<br>\
support to Him; not supported; whereas God<br>\
saith [in the Kur., xxxv. 39], “Verily God<br>\
holdeth the heavens and the earth, lest they<br>\
should move from their place; and if they should<br>\
move from their place, no one would hold them<br>\
after Him: ” or, as some say, it is the highest<br>\
sphere; [or the empyrean;] and the كرسىّ is the<br>\
sphere of the stars: and they adduce as an indication thereof the saying of Mohammad, that the<br>\
seven heavens and earths, by the side of the<br>\
كرسىّ, are nought but as a ring thrown down in<br>\
a desert land; and such is the كرسىّ with respect<br>\
to the عَرْش: and this assertion is mentioned in<br>\
the B, but without approval: (TA:) [it appears,<br>\
however, to be most commonly accepted:] or a<br>\
red sapphire, which glistens with the light of the<br>\
Supreme. (A, K.) [Hence the saying,] مِنَ<br>\
العَرْشِ إِلَى الفَرْشِ meaning, [From the highest<br>\
sphere, or the empyrean, to] the earth. (A.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
Also The سَرِير [or throne] (S, A, O, Msb, K) of<br>\
a king; (S, A, O, K;) the seat of a sultán;<br>\
[perhaps as being likened to the عرش of God;<br>\
or, more probably, from its being generally surmounted by a canopy; or] because of its height.<br>\
(Er-Rághib.) [Hence,] the phrase اِسْتَوَى عَلَى<br>\
عَرْشِهِ means He reigned as king. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
And [hence, also,] Certain stars in advance of<br>\
السِّمَاك الأَعْزَل [which is Spica Virginis]; (TA;)<br>\
[app. those meant by what here follows;] عَرْشُ<br>\
السِّمَاكِ signifies four small stars [app.<br>\
γ, δ, ε,<br>\
and<br>\
η, of Virgo, regarded as the seat of Bootes,<br>\
the principal star of which is called السِّمَاكُ الرَّامِحُ,<br>\
being described as] beneath العَوَّآء [which is a<br>\
name of Bootes and also of the four stars mentioned above], and also called عَجُزُ الأَسَدِ [the<br>\
rump of Leo, the figure of which was extended<br>\
by the Arabs far beyond the limits which we<br>\
assign to it]. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b10-  And عَرْشُ الجَوْزَآءِ<br>\
[The seat of Orion; applied by our astronomers<br>\
to<br>\
α of Lepus; but described as] four stars, of<br>\
which two are on the fore legs and two on the<br>\
hind legs, of Lepus. (Kzw.) ―<br>\
-b11-  And عَمْشُ الثَّرَيَّا<br>\
Certain stars near الثُّرَيَّا [or the Pleiades]. (T,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-  عَرْشٌ also signifies The جَمَازَة; (O, K,<br>\
TA;) i. e., the bier of a corpse. (O, TA.) And<br>\
hence, as some say, the expression in a trad.,<br>\
اِهْتَزَّ العَرْشُ لِمَوْتِ سَعْدِ بْنِ مُعَاذٍ, meaning The bier<br>\
rejoiced [lit. shook] at the death of Saad Ibn-Mo&#39;ádh; i. e., at carrying him upon it to his<br>\
place of burial: (O, K, * TA:) but there are<br>\
other explanations, for which see art. هز. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b13-  The wood with which a well is cased after it<br>\
has been cased with stones (S, O, K) in its lowest<br>\
part (S, O) to the height of the stature of a man:<br>\
(S, O, K:) pl. عُرُوشٌ. (S, O.) [Another meaning<br>\
of the same word in relation to a well has been mentioned before.] ―<br>\
-b14-  (assumed tropical:)  The nest of a bird, such as is built<br>\
in a tree, (K,) [app. as being likened to a booth.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b15-  The angle, or corner, or strongest side, syn. رُكْن,<br>\
(Ks, Zj, K,) of a house, (Ks, Zj,) or [other] thing:<br>\
(K:) pl. عُرُوشٌ. (Ks, Zj.) Accord. to some,<br>\
the phrase in the Kur [ii. 261, mentioned above],<br>\
خَاوِيَةٌ عَلَى عُرُوشِهَا, means Empty, and fallen to<br>\
ruin upon its أَرْكَان [or angles, &amp;c.]. (Ks, Zj,<br>\
O.) ―<br>\
-b16-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  The head, or chief, who is the<br>\
manager or regulator of the affairs, of a people,<br>\
or company of men: (K:) likened to the عَرْش<br>\
of a house. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b17-  [Hence also,] (assumed tropical:)  The means<br>\
of support of a thing, or an affair. (A, O, K.)<br>\
Hence the saying, ثُلَّ عَرْشُهُ, (O, K,) meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  His means of support became taken away:<br>\
(TA:) or he perished: (A:) or he was slain; as<br>\
also ↓ ثُلَّ عُرْشُهُ: (IDrd, in M, art. ثل:) or<br>\
his might, or power, departed: (TA:) or his<br>\
affairs, or state, became weak, and his might, or<br>\
power, departed. (S, O. [See also art. ثل.] [For<br>\
عَرْشٌ also signifies] ―<br>\
-b18-  (tropical:)  Might, or power: (Er-Rághib, K:) regal power; sovereignty; dominion:<br>\
(IAar, Er-Rághib, K:) from the same word as<br>\
signifying the throne, or seat, of a king. (Er-Rághib.) ―<br>\
-b19-  And The protuberant part (S, O, K)<br>\
in, (S, O,) or of, (K,) the upper surface of the<br>\
foot, (S, O, K,) in which are the toes; (S, O,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ عُرْشٌ: pl. [of pauc.] أَعْرَاشٌ and<br>\
[of mult.] عِرَشَةٌ: (O, TA:) and the part between<br>\
the عَيْر [or prominent bone] and the toes, of the<br>\
upper surface of the foot; as also ↓ عُرْشٌ: (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O, K:) pls. the same as last mentioned<br>\
above: (K:) or ↓ عُرْشٌ signifies the upper surface<br>\
of the foot; and its lower surface is called the<br>\
أَخْمَص. (IAar.)<br>\
عُرْشٌ, both as a sing. and as a pl.: see عَرْشٌ,<br>\
last sentence, in three places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and the same<br>\
paragraph, first and second sentences, in four<br>\
places: and see ثُلَّ عُرْشُهُ in the latter part of the<br>\
same paragraph. ―<br>\
-b3-  العُرْشَانِ signifies Two oblong<br>\
portions of flesh in the two sides of the neck, [app.<br>\
the two sterno-mastoid muscles,] (S, A, O, K, TA,)<br>\
between which are the vertebræ [of the neck]:<br>\
(TA:) or in the base of the neck: (K:) or the<br>\
base [itself] of the neck: so in the phrase ثَلَّ<br>\
عُرْشَيْهِ: (IDrd and M in art ثل, q. v.:) or the<br>\
أَخْدَعَانِ [or two branches of the occipital artery],<br>\
(TA, as from the K, [in which I do not find it,])<br>\
which are (TA) [in] the two places of the cuppingvessels: (K, TA:) or the أَخْدَعَانِ are in the<br>\
عُرْشَانِ: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O:) or the عُرْش is a vein<br>\
in the base of the neck: (Th, O:) or the عُرْشَانِ<br>\
are [app. the two greater cornua of the os hyoides,<br>\
which forms a support to the tongue; two bones<br>\
in the لَهَاة [meaning furthest part of the mouth],<br>\
which erect the tongue. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.) It<br>\
is related in a trad., respecting the slaying of<br>\
Aboo-Jahl, that he said to Ibn-Mes&#39;ood, خُذْ<br>\
سَيْفِى فَاجْتَزَّ بِهِ رَأْسِي مِنْ عُرْشَيَّ [Take thou my<br>\
sword, and cut with it my head from my عُرْشَانِ].<br>\
(O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  The ear: (K:) or (assumed tropical:)  the two<br>\

O, K,) but not [exactly the same as] it, made for<br>\

of a vine: (Er-Rághib:) or ↓ عَرِيشَةٌ, with ة, is<br>\
the same as هودج; and its pl. is عَرَائِشُ, (Msb,)<br>\
which signifies the same as هَوَادِجُ. (ISh, A.) ―<br>\
