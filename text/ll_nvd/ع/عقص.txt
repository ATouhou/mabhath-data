signifies what a woman makes, of her hair, like a<br>\
pomegranate; each lock of which is termed عَقِيصَةٌ;<br>\
the pl. being عِقَاصٌ and عَقَائِصُ. (S, O.) [See<br>\

hanging down loosely from the middle of the head<br>\
to the back]. (Mgh. [But this is said in relation<br>\

عِقْصَةٌ in any of the senses before explained.])<br>\
