عَجُمَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
عَجْمٌ (S, Msb, K) and عُجُومٌ, (K,) He bit it:<br>\
(Msb, K:) and he chewed it: (Msb:) or he<br>\

he bit it, namely, a gaming-arrow known for<br>\
winning, between two lateral teeth, in order to<br>\

كَأَنِّى كُنْتُ فِى الأُمَمِ الخَوَالِى<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  And I have tried affairs, and they have tried<br>\
me, as though I were of the generations that have<br>\
passed away]; meaning, as though I were one of<br>\
the long-lived, by reason of my many trials.<br>\

عَجُمَ,]<br>\

and [a barbarousness, or vitiousness, therein, especially in speaking Arabic; (see عُجْمَةٌ below;)<br>\

2<br>\
عَجَّمَ see 4.<br>\
3<br>\
عَاْجَمَ see the verse cited in the first paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
اعجمهُ He made it (i. e. speech, or language,<br>\
S, K, or a thing, TA) to want, or be without, or<br>\
to have a quality the contrary of, clearness, perspicuousness, or distinctness; (S, Msb, K, * TA;)<br>\
or [to be barbarous, or vitious, i. e.] to want, or<br>\
be without, chasteness, or correctness. (K, * TA.)<br>\
Ru-beh says, [in some verses very differently cited<br>\
in different copies of the S,] of him who attempts<br>\
poetry without having knowledge thereof,<br>\
يُرِيدُ أَنْ يُعْرِبَهُ فَيُعْجِمُهْ<br>\
[He desires to make it clear, &amp;c., and he makes<br>\
it to want clearness, &amp;c.]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He dotted<br>\
it, or pointed it, (S, K,) namely, a letter, (S,) or<br>\
a writing; (K;) he removed its عُجْمَة [or want<br>\
of clearness, &amp;c.,] by means of dots, or [diacritical]<br>\
points, (Nh, Msb, TA,) and [the signs called]<br>\
شَكْل, [but see شكل,] which distinguished it,<br>\
namely, a letter, from other letters; the ا denoting<br>\
privation; (Msb;) as ISd holds to be the case;<br>\
(TA;) and so ↓ عجّمهُ, (S, * K,) inf. n. تَعْجِيمٌ;<br>\
(S;) and ↓ عَجَمَهُ, (K,) inf. n. عَجْمٌ; (S;) for<br>\
J&#39;s assertion [in the S] that one should not say<br>\
عَجَمْتُ is a mistake: (K:) this last verb, however, which J thus disallows, is disallowed also<br>\
by Th, in his Fs, and by most of the expositors<br>\
thereof; and J confined himself to the correct<br>\
and chaste. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He locked it; namely,<br>\
a door. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  نَهَانَا النِّبِىُّ أَنْ نُعْجِمَ النَّوَى طَبْخًا<br>\
[The Prophet forbade us to make the date-stones to<br>\
become as though they were chewed and bitten],<br>\
(K,* TA,) occurring in a trad., means that when<br>\
dates are cooked for دِبْس, (K, TA,) i. e. for<br>\
taking their sweetness, (TA,) they should be<br>\
cooked gently, so that the cooking shall not<br>\
extend to the stones, (K, TA,) nor produce upon<br>\
them such an effect as that of their being chewed<br>\
and bitten, (TA,) and thus spoil the taste of the<br>\
حَلَاوَة, (K, TA,) so in the copies of the K, but<br>\
correctly, as in the Nh, the سُلَافَة [here meaning<br>\
the sweet decocture]; (TA;) or because they [the<br>\
date-stones] are food for the home-fed animals,<br>\
and therefore they should not be thoroughly<br>\
cooked, that their taste, (K, TA,) in the Nh<br>\
their strength, (TA,) may not go away: (K,<br>\
TA:) or the meaning is, [that he forbade] the<br>\
cooking the date-stones immoderately, so that<br>\
they would crumble, and their strength, with<br>\
which they would be good for the sheep, or goats,<br>\
would be spoiled. (TA.)<br>\

استعجم He was unable to speak: (TA:)<br>\
he was silent, mute, or speechless; (K, TA;) said<br>\
of a man. (TA.) And اِسْتَعْجَمَتِ الدَّارُ عَنْ جَوَابِ<br>\
سَائِلِهَا [The dwelling kept silence from replying to<br>\
its interrogator]: and Imra-el-Keys says,<br>\
صَمَّ صَدَاهَا وَعَفَا رَسْمُهَا<br>\
وَاسْتَعْجَمَتْ عَنْ مَنْطِقِ السَّائِلِ<br>\
[Its echo has become dumb, and its trace has<br>\
become effaced, and it has become in the state of<br>\
keeping silence from answering the speech of the<br>\
interrogator]: he makes استعجمت trans. by<br>\
means of عن because it is used in the sense of<br>\
سَكَتَتْ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, استعجم عَلَيْهِ<br>\
الكَلَامُ, (S,) or عَلَيْنَا, (Msb,) meaning Speech was<br>\
as though it were closed against him, or us; or he,<br>\
or we, became impeded in speech, unable to speak,<br>\
or tongue-tied; syn. اِسْتَبْهَمَ: (S, Msb:) and<br>\
عليه الكلام ↓ انعجم; [which means the same;]<br>\
syn. اِنْطَبَقَ and اِنْغَلَقَ. (K * and TA in art. طبق.)<br>\
And accord. to the K, one says, استعجم القِرَآءَةَ,<br>\
meaning He was unable to perform [or continue]<br>\
the recitation, or reading, by reason of the overcoming of drowsiness: but what is said in the Nh<br>\
and other works is اِسْتَعْحَمَتْ عَلَيْهِ قِرَآءَتُهُ i. e.<br>\
His recitation, or reading, was cut short, and he<br>\
was unable to perform [or continue] it, by reason<br>\
of drowsiness: and it is also expl. as meaning he<br>\
was, or became, impeded in his recitation, or<br>\
reading, and unable to perform [or continue] it,<br>\
as though he became one in whom was عُجْمَة.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And استعجم الخَبَرُ means The information, or narration, was dubious, confused,<br>\
vague, or difficult to be understood or expressed;<br>\
or was not to be understood or expressed; as<br>\
though it were closed [against the hearer or<br>\
speaker]; syn. اِسْتَبْهَمَ, and اِسْتَغْلَقَ. (Msb in<br>\

the male and to the female: (S, Msb, K:) pl.<br>\

a verse of Lebeed cited voce رَازِقِىٌّ,] (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
or this latter may be a pl. of the former: (TA:)<br>\
↓ عَجَمِىٌّ (of which أَعْجَامٌ is pl., TA) signifies<br>\

the race of the عَجَم; (K;) though he may be<br>\
chaste, or correct, in [the Arabic] speech; (Mgh,<br>\
K;) the ى denoting unity; but it is also the<br>\
relative ى, and thus one may apply to an Arab<br>\
the appellation ↓ عَجَمِىٌّ as meaning called thus in<br>\
relation to the عَجَم: (Msb:) and one says also<br>\
↓ رَجُلٌ أَعْجَمُ [a man not of the Arabs]: and<br>\

(K.)<br>\

a thing that is eaten such as the raisin and the<br>\
like; (S;) and ↓ عُجَامٌ signifies the same: (K:)<br>\
the vulgar say ↓ عَجْم: (Yaakoob, S:) [see also<br>\
غِيضٌ, in an explanation of which عَجَمٌ is evidently, I think, used as meaning the heart (commonly termed جُمَّار q. v.) of the palm-tree:] the<br>\
n. un. is عَجَمَةٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) which is incorrectly expl. by AHn as meaning a grape-stone<br>\
when it germinates. (ISd, TA.)<br>\

he may be an Arab; (S, Mgh, Msb;) and<br>\
↓ أَعْجَمِىٌّ signifies the same, (Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\

mean in which is fatness. (TA.)<br>\
