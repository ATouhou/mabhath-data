care for it. (Lth, O, TA.) One says, مَا عَاجَ بِقَوْلِهِ,<br>\
inf. n. عَيْجٌ and عَيْجُوجَةٌ, He did not regard his<br>\
saying: or he did not believe it. (ISd, TA.) And<br>\
مَا أَعِيجُ مِنْ كَلَامِهِ بِشَىْءٍ I care not for anything<br>\
of his speech, or of what he says: (Fr, ISk, S, O:)<br>\
and the Benoo-Asad say, مَا أَعُوجُ بِكَلَامِهِ [expl. in<br>\

the water: (S, O, K, TA:) said by one who has<br>\
drunk salt water: (S, O, TA:) or I did not profit by it: and sometimes the verb is used in this<br>\
sense in an affirmative phrase. (TA.) And مَا<br>\
عِجْتُ بِالدَّوَآءِ I did not profit by the medicine.<br>\
(S, O, K.) And عاج, aor. يَعِيجُ, [thus used<br>\
affirmatively,] He profited by speech, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\

or mind, (compare عُجْتُ بِالمَكَانِ, in art. عوج,)]<br>\
is a saying mentioned by IAar. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [And<br>\
it seems that عاج عَلَى الشَّئِْ signifies He took to,<br>\
set about, or commenced, the thing: for Sgh says<br>\
that] العَيْجُ signifies الإِقْبَالُ عَلَى الشَّئِْ. (O.)<br>\
عَيْجٌ an inf. n. of 1. (Lth, O, &amp;c.) ―<br>\

Profit, advantage, or utility. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [its<br>\
pl.] أَعْيَاجٌ signifies Any means of satisfying a<br>\
man&#39;s thirst: [and ↓ عِيَاجٌ seems to have a similar signification, for it is immediately added,] and<br>\
one says, اللَّبَنُ عِيَاجٌ [app. meaning Milk is a<br>\
thing that satisfies thirst]. (O.)<br>\
