عَزَبَ, aor.<br>\
عَزُبَ (S, O, Msb) and<br>\
عَزِبَ, (S, O,) inf. n.<br>\
عُزُوبٌ, (S, Msb,) He, (a man, S, O,) or it, (a<br>\
thing, Msb,) was, or became, distant, or remote;<br>\
(S, O, Msb;) and absent; عَنِّى from me: (S,<br>\
O:) or ↓ اعزب has the former meaning: (K:)<br>\
and عَزَبَ, aor.<br>\
عَزُبَ and<br>\
عَزِبَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. as<br>\
above, (K,) signifies he, or it, was, or became,<br>\
absent, (Msb, K,) and concealed: (Msb:) and<br>\
went away, or departed. (K, TA.) You say,<br>\
عَزَبَ بِهَا, referring to sheep or goats, He went to<br>\
a distance, or far off, with them: so in a trad.:<br>\
or, as some relate it, بها ↓ عزّب, meaning he went<br>\
with them to a remote pasturage: and he pastured<br>\
them (namely, camels,) at a distance from the<br>\
place of abode of the tribe, not repairing, or returning, to them [in the evening]: and ↓ تعزّب,<br>\
and thus the verb is written in copies of the K<br>\
in a place where some copies have يَعْزُبُ, occurs<br>\
in the phrase تعزّب عَنْ أَهْلِهِ وَمَالِهِ [He went away<br>\
to a distance from his family and his cattle, or<br>\
camels &amp;c.]. (TA.) And عَزَبَتِ الإِبِلُ The camels<br>\
went away to a distance in the pasturage, not returning in the evening: (S, O:) and in like manner one says of sheep or goats. (O.) And لَا<br>\
يَعْزُبُ عَنْ عِلْمِهِ شَىْءٌ Nothing is absent from his<br>\
(God&#39;s) knowledge. (TA. [See Kur x.62 and<br>\
xxxiv. 3.]) And عَزَبَ طُهْرُ المُرْأَةِ [The woman&#39;s<br>\
state of pureness from the menstrual discharge<br>\
was a remote thing] means (assumed tropical:)  the woman&#39;s husband<br>\
was absent from her: (K:) or [rather] is said<br>\
of the woman when her husband is absent from<br>\
her. (S, O.) And عَزَبَ عَنْ فُلَانٍ حِلْمُهُ [Such a<br>\
one&#39;s forbearance quitted him]; (S, O;) as also<br>\
↓ اعزب. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, aor.<br>\
عَزُبَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
عُزْبَةٌ and عُزُوبَةٌ, (Msb, MF, TA,) or these are<br>\
simple substs., (S, K,) (assumed tropical:)  He was without a wife;<br>\
or in a state of celibacy. (Msb, K.) [And app.<br>\
عَزَبَتْ is said in like manner of a woman, meaning (assumed tropical:)  She was without a husband. See also 5.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And عَزَبَتِ الأَرْضُ (assumed tropical:)  The land, whether fruitful<br>\
or unfruitful, was, or became, destitute of inhabitants; had in it no one. (S, O, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
عزّب بِهَا: see 1, second sentence. عُزِّبَ بِهِ<br>\
عَنِ الدَّارِ is said of a herd of pasturing camels<br>\
[meaning It was taken to pasture at a distance<br>\
from the place of abode]. (S, O, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is<br>\
said in a trad. (S, O) of the Prophet, (O,) مَنْ قَرَأَ<br>\
القُرْآنَ فِى أَرْبَعِينَ لَيْلَةً فَقَدْ عَزَّبَ, meaning (tropical:)  [He<br>\
who reads, or recites, the Kur-án in forty nights]<br>\
goes to a remote period of time from his commencement; (S, O, TA;) or makes the time of the commencement thereof to be remote; (A;) and is<br>\
tardy in doing so. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عزّب إِبِلَهُ: see 4.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  لَيْسَ لِفُلَانٍ امْرَأَةٌ تُعَزِّبُهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  There is not<br>\
for such a one a woman to put an end to his<br>\
celibacy by marriage, is like the saying هِىَ تُمَرِّضُهُ<br>\
“ she takes care of him in his sickness. ” (O,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And one says, فُلَانٌ يُعَزِّبُ فُلَانًا وَيُرْبِضُهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Such a one undertakes, or manages, the affairs<br>\
of such a one, and his expenses]; i. e., acts for<br>\
him like a treasurer. (TA, from the Nawádir el-Aaráb. [In art. ربض in the TA, عزّبه is said to<br>\
signify, agreeably with the explanation above,<br>\
قَامَ عَلَيْهِ.])<br>\
4<br>\
اعزب He made to be distant, or remote; or<br>\
to go far away. (K, * TA.) You say, اعزبهُ اللّٰهُ<br>\
God made him, or may God make him, to go<br>\
away, or far away. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اعزب الإِبِلَ He<br>\
drove the camels to a distance in the pasturage,<br>\
not to return in the evening. (TA.) And اعزب<br>\
إِبِلَهُ and ↓ عزّبها He made his camels to pass the<br>\
night in the pasturage, not bringing them back in<br>\
the evening. (TA.) And اعزب جَمَلَهُ is like أَضَلَّهُ<br>\
[He made his camel to go astray]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence,] اعزب اللّٰهُ عَنْهُ حِلْمَهُ (assumed tropical:)  God made his forbearance to become remote from him. (O.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And أَعْزَبْنَا الكَلَأَ, (O,) or أَعْزَبْنَا alone, (S,) We<br>\
lighted upon remote herbage. (S, O.)<br>\
-A2-  As intrans.: see 1, first sentence: and the same in the<br>\
latter half. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اعزب القَوْمُ The people&#39;s<br>\
camels went away to a distance in the pasturage,<br>\
not to return in the evening. (S, * O, * K, * TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعزّب: see 1, second sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He<br>\
passed the night with his camels in the pasturage,<br>\
not returning in the evening. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
abstained from marriage: (K, TA:) and in like<br>\
manner تعزّبت is said of a woman. (TA.) One<br>\
says, تعزّب زَمَانًا ثُمَّ تَأَهَّلَ (S, O) (assumed tropical:)  He was without<br>\
a wife [a long time, or he abstained from marriage a long time; then he took a wife]. (O.)<br>\
[See also 1, near the end.]<br>\
عَزَبٌ [correctly thus, but in the sense here following written in the TA without any syll. signs,<br>\
and in the O written عِزَّبٌ,] A man who goes<br>\
away to a distance into the country, or in the<br>\
land. (O, TA.) [And One who goes far away<br>\
with his camels to pasture: pl. أَعْزَابٌ. (See also<br>\
عَزِيبٌ and عَازِبٌ and مُعْزِبٌ and مِعْزَابَةٌ.)] هِرَاوَةُ<br>\
الأَعْزَابِ means The staff of those who go far away<br>\
with their camels to pasture; and a horse is<br>\
likened thereto, (S, O, TA,) on account of its<br>\
compactness and smoothness; so in a marginal<br>\
note in the L: (TA:) [Sgh, however, says,] thus<br>\
in some of the lexicons, but in my opinion, (O,)<br>\
it was the name of a mare which was not to be<br>\
outstripped, and which was thus called because<br>\
her owner gave her gratuitously for the use of<br>\
those of his people who had no wives, who made<br>\
predatory attacks upon her, and when one of<br>\
them acquired for himself property and a wife,<br>\
he resigned her to another of his people: (O,<br>\
K: *) whence the prov.<br>\
أَعَزُّ مِنْ هِرَاوَةِ الأَعْزَابِ<br>\
[More highly esteemed than Hiráwet-el-Aazáb].<br>\
(O.) See an ex. in a verse cited voce عَدِيدٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also عَازِبٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Whatever is alone, solitary, or apart from others. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
man having no wife; (Ks, S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ عَازِبٌ, (Msb, * TA,) which is the original;<br>\
(Msb;) and ↓ عَزِيبٌ, and ↓ مِعْزَابَةٌ [which see<br>\
below]; (K;) but not ↓ أَعْزَابُ, (Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) this being disallowed by AHát, (O, Msb,)<br>\
and others; (TA;) or it is rare; (K;) but it<br>\
occurs in a trad.; (Mgh, O;) and some allow<br>\
it: (O, Msb:) the pl. of the first is أَعْزَابٌ, (O,<br>\
K,) or عُزَّابٌ, (S, * Msb,) which is thus because<br>\
the original form of the sing. is considered as<br>\
being ↓ عَازِبٌ, this pl. being like كُفَّارٌ as pl. of<br>\
كَافِرٌ, (Msb,) or عَزَبٌ has both of these pls., (O,)<br>\
or عُزَّابٌ is pl. of ↓ عَازِبٌ, (TA,) and is applied to<br>\
men and to (assumed tropical:)  women as meaning having no<br>\
spouses: (S, TA:) عَزَبَةٌ is applied to (assumed tropical:)  a woman<br>\
[as meaning having no husband], (Ks, S, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) and (O, Msb, K) so عَزَبٌ; (Zj, Kz, Mgh,<br>\
O, Msb, K;) and if أَعْزَبُ be applied to a man,<br>\
↓ عَزْبَآءُ, may by rule be applied to a woman; and<br>\
the pl. of عَزَبَةٌ is عَزَبَاتٌ: (Msb:) or, accord. to<br>\
Zj, عَزَبَةٌ is a mistake of Abu-l-&#39;Abbás [i. e. Th],<br>\
and عَزَبٌ is used as an epithet of a man and of a<br>\
woman, like as is خَصْمٌ, and does not assume a<br>\
dual form nor a pl. nor a fem. form, because it is<br>\
originally an inf. n.; MF, however, denies that<br>\
we have any authority for calling عَزَبٌ an inf. n.:<br>\
he considers it to be a simple epithet, like حَسَنٌ<br>\
&amp;c.; and if used in the fem. sense without the<br>\
termination ة otherwise than by poetic license, to<br>\
be an anomalous epithet, like عَانِسٌ, which is<br>\
applied alike to a man and to a woman: the<br>\
phrase رَجُلَانِ عَزَبَانِ is also mentioned: and the<br>\
saying إِنَّهُ لَعَزَبٌ لَزَبٌ [in which the latter epithet<br>\
is merely an imitative sequent corrobative of the<br>\
former], and إِنَّهَا لَعَزَبَةٌ لَزَبَةٌ: and عَزَبٌ is said to<br>\
be [also] a quasi-pl. n. [of عَازِبٌ], like as خَدَمٌ is<br>\
of خَادِمٌ. (TA.)<br>\
عُزْبَةٌ and ↓ عُزُوبَةٌ The state of having no wife<br>\
or husband; celibacy. (S, K. [Each said in the<br>\
S and K to be a simple subst.: but see 1, near<br>\
the end.])<br>\
عَزِيبٌ A man who has gone away to a distance<br>\
(تَعَزَّبَ, as in some copies of the K), or who goes<br>\
away to a distance (يَعْزُبُ, as in other copies of<br>\
the K), from his family and his cattle, or camels<br>\
&amp;c. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Cattle, or camels &amp;c., at<br>\
a distance from the tribe: heard by Az in this<br>\
sense from the Arabs: (TA:) or a herd of<br>\
camels, and the like of sheep or goats, that go<br>\
away to a distance from their owners in the pasturage: (K, TA:) and إِبِلٌ عَزِيبٌ camels that do<br>\
not return in the evening to the tribe: عَزِيبٌ<br>\
thus used is pl. (or a quasi-pl. n., TA) of ↓ عَازِبٌ,<br>\
like as غَزِىٌّ is of غَازٍ. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also<br>\
عَازِبٌ ―<br>\
-b4-  And see عَزَبٌ, near the middle.<br>\
عَزُوبَةٌ A land in which one has to go far for<br>\
pasturage; (O, K;) in which the pasturage is<br>\
little: (TA:) the ة is to render the signification<br>\
intensive. (O.)<br>\
عُزُوبَةٌ: see عُزْبَةٌ.<br>\
عَازِبٌ Distant, or remote: (Msb, TA:) applied<br>\
in this sense to herbage: (S, K:) or, applied to<br>\
herbage, such as has not been depastured at all,<br>\
nor trodden: and, accord. to the A, only such as<br>\
is in a desert in which is no seed-produce: (TA:)<br>\
and it is likewise applied to meadows (رَوْضٌ)<br>\
[app. as meaning distant, or remote]; as also<br>\
↓ عَزِيبٌ. (A, TA.) In the following saying,<br>\
وَصَدْرٍ أَرَاحَ اللَّيْلُ عَازِبَ هَمِّهِ<br>\
تَضَاعَفَ فِيهِ الحُزْنُ مِنْ كُلِّ جَانِبِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [In many a bosom whose remote (or long-past)<br>\
anxiety night has brought back, grief has multiplied from every quarter], it is used metaphorically. (A.) And [in like manner,] in a trad. of<br>\
&#39;Átikeh,<br>\
قَهُنَّ هَوَآءٌ وَالحُلُومُ عَوَازِبُ<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  And they are devoid of reason, the intel-lects [being] far away: عَوَازِبُ here being pl. of<br>\
عَازِبٌ. (L, TA.) And [in a similar manner,]<br>\
عَوَازِبُ الأَطْهَارِ [in which عَوَازِبُ is pl. of عَازِبَةٌ] is<br>\
applied as an epithet to women whose husbands are<br>\
absent: (S and O and TA, from a verse of En-Ná-<br>\
bighah Edh-Dhubyánee: [for the lit. meaning, see<br>\
1, latter half:]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [for] عَازِبٌ signifies also Absent; and concealed. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is also applied<br>\
to sheep or goats, (شَآءٌ, O, TA, and غَنَمٌ, O,) and<br>\
to camels, (إِبِلٌ, O,) meaning Remote in the pasturage, (O, TA,) that do not return in the evening, (O,) or that do not repair to the place of<br>\
alighting and abode [of their owners] in the night:<br>\
(TA:) and [in like manner] ↓ عَزَبٌ is applied to<br>\
cattle, or camels &amp;c., (مَالٌ, A, O, TA,) meaning<br>\
that go away to a distance from their owners.<br>\
(O.) See also عَزِيبٌ [which, thus applied, is a<br>\
quasi-pl. n. of عَازِبٌ]. And عَازِبَةٌ is likewise applied to camels (O, K) as meaning That go far<br>\
away to pasture: (O, K: *) so in the prov. إِنَّمَا<br>\
اشْتَرَيْتُ الغَنَمَ حِذَارَ العَازِبَةِ [I only bought the sheep,<br>\
or goats, in fear of loosing those that go far away<br>\
to pasture]: said by a man who had camels, and<br>\
sold them, and bought sheep, or goats, lest they<br>\
[the camels] should go far away to pasture; and<br>\
his sheep, or goats, did so: (O, K:) it is applied<br>\
to the case of him who acts with gentleness [or<br>\
precaution] in the easiest of affairs, and has unexpected difficulty, or trouble, inseparable from<br>\
him. (O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also عَزَبٌ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And see مُعَزِّبَةٌ.<br>\
عَوْزَبٌ An old woman: (O, K:) so called because of the long period that has elapsed since<br>\
her marriage. (TA.)<br>\
أَعْزَبُ; and the fem. عَزْبَآءُ: see عَزَبٌ.<br>\
مُعْزِبٌ One who goes away from his family with<br>\
his camels. (Az, TA.) [See also عَزَبٌ and عَزِيبٌ<br>\
&amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And Seeking distant herbage, such as is<br>\
termed عَازِبٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And One whose camels<br>\
go away to a distance in the pasturage, not to return in the evening. (S, TA.)<br>\
مِعْزَبَةٌ A female slave: (O, K:) or, accord. to<br>\
Th, applied only to a woman that has not a husband: (TA:) pl. مَعَازِبُ, for which مَعَازِيبُ occurs<br>\
in a verse of Aboo-Khirásh El-Hudhalee. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also مُعَزِّبَةٌ.<br>\
مُعَزَّبٌ A herd of pasturing camels taken to pasture at a distance (عُزِّبَ بِهِ) from the place of<br>\
abode. (S, O, K. *)<br>\
مُعَزِّبَةٌ (A, O, K) and ↓ مِعْزَبَةٌ and ↓ عَازِبَةٌ (K)<br>\
(tropical:)  A man&#39;s wife, (A, O, K,) to whom he resorts,<br>\
and who undertakes the preparing of his food and<br>\
the taking care of his implements, utensils, accoutrements, or furniture. (O.)<br>\
مِعْزَابٌ: see what follows, in two places.<br>\
مِعْزَابَةٌ A man who goes away to a distance with<br>\
his cattle, or camels &amp;c., (S, A, O, K,) from<br>\
others, in the pasturage; (S, O;) as also ↓ مِعْزَابٌ:<br>\
(A, O, K:) accord. to Az, the former is the only<br>\
epithet of the measure مِفْعَالَةٌ, except مِجْذَامَةٌ,<br>\
which is sometimes used; [but in the TA, مِطْرَابَةٌ<br>\
and مِطْوَاعَةٌ and مِقْدَامَةٌ also are mentioned;] the<br>\
ة in معزابة, he says, is added to give intensiveness<br>\
to the signification, and to imply praise; the<br>\
meaning being, in his opinion, a man who frequently betakes himself, with his cattle, or camels<br>\
&amp;c., pasturing at a distance from others, to the<br>\
places where rain has fallen, and to the uncropped<br>\
herbage produced thereby; and he adds that the ة<br>\
is affixed to a masc. epithet to imply praise or<br>\
blame when intensiveness is meant. (TA.) The<br>\
two epithets above are also expl. as applied to a<br>\
man who pastures his camels at a distance from<br>\
the abode of the tribe, not repairing to them to<br>\
rest. (TA.) [See also عَزَبٌ &amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S,<br>\
O, K, TA,) or ↓ مِعْزَابٌ, (A, TA,) (tropical:)  A man who<br>\
has been long without a wife, (S, A, O, K, TA,)<br>\
so that he has no need of one. (TA.) ―<br>\
