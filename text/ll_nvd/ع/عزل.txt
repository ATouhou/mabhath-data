عَزَلَهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
عَزِلَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. عَزْلٌ, (Msb, TA,) He put it, or set it, apart,<br>\
away, or aside; removed it; or separated it;<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K;) i. e., a thing; عَنْ غَيْرِهِ [from<br>\
another thing, or from other things]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And hence, He removed, deposed, or displaced,<br>\
him, namely, an agent, or a deputy, from his<br>\
office, or exercise of authority. (Msb.) Or عَزَلَهُ<br>\
عَنِ العَمَلِ He removed, deposed, or displaced, him<br>\
[from the agency, or administration, or government]. (S, O, TA.) And ↓ عزّلهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
تَعْزِيلٌ, (TA,) signifies the same as عَزَلَهُ. (K, TA.)<br>\
[In like manner also اعزل is said by Freytag<br>\
to signify Semovit, followed by عن, as on the<br>\
authority of the K; in which I do not find it.]<br>\
And عُزِلَ He was, or became, removed deposed,<br>\
or displaced, [from his office, &amp;c.,] (S, O, Msb,)<br>\
used as quasi-pass. of عَزَلَهُ; in which sense ↓ انعزل<br>\
is [said to be] not used, because in it [i. e. عَزَلَهُ] no<br>\
labour, or exertion, is implied. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عَزَلَ<br>\
said of the مُجَامِع means Paulò ante emissionem,<br>\
[penem suum] extraxit, et extra vulvam semen<br>\
emisit. (Az, * Msb, TA. *) You say, عَزَلَ عَنْهَا,<br>\
(S, O, K,) the pronoun referring to the man&#39;s<br>\
female slave, (S, O,) inf. n. عَزْلٌ, (Az, Mgh, O,<br>\
TA,) [vaguely expl. as] meaning He did not<br>\
desire her [having] offspring; as also ↓ اِعْتَزَلَهَا:<br>\
(K:) the motive being that the woman might not<br>\
conceive. (Az, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَزِلَ, aor.<br>\
عَزَلَ, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
عَزَلٌ, (Mgh, * TA,) He (a horse) had his tail inclining to one side, (Mgh, TA,) by habit, not<br>\
naturally: (TA:) when it inclines to the right<br>\
side, the Arabs deem it unlucky. (Z, TA.) [See<br>\
also عَزَلٌ below.]<br>\

عَزَّلَ see the preceding paragraph.<br>\

removed; or separated themselves; each from<br>\
other, or one party from another. (K, TA.)<br>\

اعتزلهُ and ↓ تعزّلهُ both signify the same, (S,<br>\
O, TA,) i. e. He went apart, away, or aside;<br>\
removed; or separated himself; from him, or it:<br>\
(O, TA:) and so اعتزل عَنْهُ and عنه ↓ تعزّل: (TA:)<br>\
or اِعْتَزَلْتُ النَّاسَ and ↓ تَعَزَّلْتُهُمْ I went apart, away,<br>\
or aside; removed; or separated myself; from<br>\
men, or the people; [withdrew from association,<br>\
or communion, with them; seceded from them;]<br>\
and left, forsook, or quitted, them: and both<br>\
verbs are sometimes used intransitively: (Msb:)<br>\
[i. e.] اعتزل and ↓ تعزّل [used alone sometimes]<br>\
signify he went apart, away, or aside; &amp;c.; as<br>\
also ↓ انعزل: (K, TA: [the last omitted in this<br>\
place in the CK; but mentioned afterwards, voce<br>\
تعازلوا:]) and they said, عَنِ النَّاسِ ↓ انعزل meaning he went apart, or aside, from men, or the<br>\
people: (Msb:) and one says, of a pastor, يَعْتَزِلُ<br>\
مِنَ النَّاسِ ↓ بِمَاشِيَتِهِ وَيَرْعَاهَا بِمَعْزِلٍ [He goes apart,<br>\
or aside, with his cattle, and pastures them in a<br>\
place remote, or separate, from men, or the people].<br>\
(S, O.) وَ إِنْ لَمْ تُؤْمِنُوا لِىْ فَاعْتَزِلُونِ, in the Kur<br>\
[xliv. 20], means, accord. to Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, [And if<br>\
ye believe me not,] leave me on equal terms, not being against me nor for me. (O.) [And you say,<br>\
اعتزلهُ إِلَى غَيْرِهِ He withdrew himself from him to<br>\
another: see Har p. 245.] And اِعْتَزَلَهَا, expl.<br>\
above, as syn. with عَزَلَ عَنْهَا: see 1. And يَعْتَزِلُ<br>\
الحَرْبَ [He withholds himself, or keeps aloof, from<br>\
war, or battle]: said of him who has no weapon.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عَزْلٌ What is brought to the treasury of the state<br>\
in advance, not weighed, nor picked so as to have<br>\
the bad put forth from it, to the time of the falling-due of the instalment: (O, K, TA:) [for the<br>\
second of the last three words of the explanation,<br>\
which are correctly إِلَى مَحِلِّ النَّجْمِ, the O has<br>\
محَلِ; the CK, مَحَلِّ; and my MS. copy of the<br>\
K, محل, without any vowel-sign and without<br>\
the sheddeh:] from Ibn-&#39;Abbád; (O;) and thus<br>\
in the L. (TA.)<br>\
عُزْلٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
عَزَلٌ inf. n. of عَزِلَ [q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The<br>\
state, or condition, of not having with one any<br>\
weapon; and so ↓ عُزْلٌ: (K, TA: [the latter,<br>\
by reason of an ambiguity in the K, misunderstood by Freytag as syn. with عِزَالٌ in the sense<br>\
in which this is expl. in the CK:]) they are two<br>\
dial. vars., like شَغَلٌ and شُغْلٌ, and بَخَلٌ and<br>\
بُخْلٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A deficiency in one of the<br>\
حَرْقَفَتَانِ [app. meaning, in the crest of one of the<br>\
two hip-bones]. (IAar, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And The hinder<br>\
part of an ass: so in the saying, اِقْرَعْ عَزَلَ حِمَارِكَ<br>\
[Strike thou the binder part of thy ass]: (O, K:)<br>\
said to the driver of the ass. (O.)<br>\
عُزُلٌ: see أَعْزَلُ, in three places.<br>\
عُزْلَةٌ a subst. (S, Msb) signifying A going apart.<br>\
away, or aside; removal, or separation of oneself;<br>\
(S, * L, Msb, * K;) [a withdrawing of oneself from<br>\
association or communion; or secession: and it<br>\
seems to be sometimes used in a sense similar to<br>\
that of اِعْتِكَافٌ; for] one says, العُزْلَةُ عِبَادَةٌ [app.<br>\
meaning Retirement, or self-seclusion, is a mode of<br>\
religious service]. (S, L, TA.)<br>\
العَزَلَةُ The حَرْقَفَة [app. meaning the crest of<br>\
the hip-bone]. (K.)<br>\
عَزْلَآءُ [originally fem. of أَعْزَلُ; a subst. signifying] The lower mouth [or spout or outlet] of the<br>\
[leathern water-bag called] مَزَادَة; (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb;) the part where the water pours forth from<br>\
the رَاوِيَة [a word here, as in many other instances, used as syn. with مَزَادَة,] and the like of<br>\
this, (K, TA,) such [for instance] as the قِرْبَة, in<br>\
the bottom thereof, where the water contained in it<br>\
is drawn forth: Kh says that to every مزادة there<br>\
are عَزْلَاوَانِ [dual of عَزْلَآءُ], in the bottom thereof;<br>\
but it is said in the M that the عزلآء is thus called<br>\
because it is in one of the خُصْمَان [meaning the<br>\
two lower corners] of the مزادة; not in its middle;<br>\
nor is it like its mouth, in which it receives the<br>\
water: (TA:) [the mouth, by means of which<br>\
this kind of water-bag is filled, is in the middle<br>\
of the upper edge; and the عزلآء, in every instance that I remember to have seen, is in the<br>\
binder of the two lower corners, and is tied<br>\
round with a thong: (see مَزَادَةٌ in art. زيد:)]<br>\
the pl. is عَزَالٍ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, * written with<br>\
the article العَزَالِى, and in the K [improperly]<br>\
عَزَالِى without the article,) and عَزَالَى also (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K) is allowable; (S, O;) and ↓ العَزَائِلُ<br>\
occurs in a trad. for العَزَالِى; these two words<br>\
being like الشَّائِكُ and الشَّاكِى. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] El-Kumeyt says, [describing clouds<br>\
(سَحَاب),]<br>\
مَرَتْهُ الجَنُوبُ فَلَمَّا اكْفَهَرْ<br>\
رَ حَلَّتْ عَزَالِيَهُ الشَّمْأَلُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The south wind drew them forth; and when<br>\
they became black and dense and accumulated, the<br>\
north wind loosed their spouts; i. e. caused the<br>\
rain to pour forth]. (S, O.) And one says of a<br>\
cloud (سَحَابَة), (Mgh, TA,) when it discharges<br>\
its pouring [rain], (Mgh,) or when it pours forth<br>\
copious rain, (TA,) أَرْخَتْ عَزَالِيَهَا (tropical:)  [It loosed its<br>\
spouts], (Mgh,) or قَدْ حَلَّتْ عَزَالِيَهَا [it has loosed<br>\
its spouts], and أَرْسَلَتْ عَزَالِيَهَا, (TA,) which<br>\
[means the same and] is said [also] of the sky<br>\
(السَّمَآء) by way of indicating the vehement falling<br>\
of the rain, this being likened to its descent from<br>\
the mouths [meaning spouts] of the مَزَادَة [or<br>\
rather of the مَزَاد or مَزَايِد]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
[hence also,] العَزْلَآءُ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The اِسْت [i. e. the<br>\
anus; as being an outlet; and as being closed by<br>\
means of a sphincter, like as the عزلآء properly<br>\
thus termed is closed by means of a thong tied<br>\
round it]. (O, K.)<br>\
عُزْلَانٌ is a word used by the vulgar in the sense<br>\
of عَزْلٌ [app. as inf. n. of عَزَلَهُ, q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
عِزَالٌ Weakness; syn. ضَعْفٌ. (L, K, TA: in<br>\
the CK ضَعِيف.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also a vulgar term for<br>\
The goods, or furniture and utensils, of the house<br>\
or tent. (TA.)<br>\
العَزَالَانِ [a dual of which the sing. is not mentioned] The two feathers that are at the extremity<br>\
of the tail of the eagle: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K:) pl.<br>\
أَعْزِلَةٌ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.)<br>\
العَزَائِلُ, for العَزَالِى: see عَزْلَآءُ.<br>\
العُزَّالُ: see المُعْتَزِلَةُ.<br>\
أَعْزَلُ Sand (رَمْل) separate, or cut off, (IAar,<br>\
O, K,) from other sands. (IAar, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
man not having with him any weapon; (S, O,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ عُزُلٌ, (O, K,) occurring in a trad.;<br>\
(O;) and ↓ مِعْزَالٌ, (K,) or this signifies not<br>\
having with him a spear; (S, * K;) and the first<br>\
is sometimes expl. as having this particular meaning: (TA:) pl. of the first, (S, O, K,) and of<br>\
↓ عُزُلٌ, (K, TA,) عُزْلٌ and عُزْلَانٌ and عُزَّلٌ, (S, O,<br>\
K,) which is anomalous, but made to accord<br>\
with حُسَّرٌ, pl. of the epithet حَاسِرٌ, because nearly<br>\
like it in meaning, (R, MF,) and أَعْزَالٌ, (K,) or<br>\
or this is pl. of ↓ عُزُلٌ, (O, TA,) and مَعَازِيلُ, (IJ,<br>\
K,) which is anomalous, (TA,) and this is pl. of<br>\
↓ مِعْزَالٌ (S, O, K) also. (K.) Hence, the epithet الأَعْزَلُ is applied to one of the سِمَاكَانِ, (S,<br>\
O, K, TA,) i. e., to one of the two stars of which<br>\
each is called السِّمَاكُ [q. v.]; (TA;) because,<br>\
unlike [the other سماك, i. e.] الرَّامِحُ, it has no<br>\
star [near] before it that is regarded as its weapon;<br>\
(S, * O, * K, * TA;) or because in the days of its<br>\
rising [aurorally] there is no cold nor wind. (O,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A bird that cannot fly. (MF, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And Clouds (سَحَاب) in which is no rain. (S,<br>\
O, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And A horse having his tail inclining<br>\
to one side, (S, Mgh, O, K,) by habit, (S, O, K,)<br>\
not naturally. (S, O.) [See عَزِلَ.] Hence the<br>\
saying, أَعُوذُ بِاللّٰهِ مِنَ الأَعْزَلِ عَلَى الأَعْزَلِ i. e. [I<br>\
seek protection by God] from a [or the] man<br>\
having with him no weapon, upon a [or the] horse<br>\
of which the عَسِيب [or bone of the tail, or part of<br>\
the tail where the hair grows,] is crooked. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And [app. as an epithet applied to an ass or<br>\
the like,] Deficient in one of the حَرْقَفَتَانِ [which<br>\
seems here to mean, in the crest of one of the two<br>\
hip-bones]. (IAar, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And The share, of<br>\
flesh-meat, of an absent man: (IAar, O, K: *)<br>\
pl. عُزْلٌ. (IAar, O.)<br>\
مَعْزِلٌ A place of removal, or separation of oneself: so in the saying, كُنْتُ بِمَعْزِلٍ عَنْ كَذَا وَكَذَا<br>\
[I was in a place, and hence in a state, of removal, or separation, of myself, from such and<br>\
such things; I was aloof therefrom]. (TA.) See<br>\
8. وَكَانَ فِى مَعْزِلٍ, in the Kur [xi. 44], means<br>\
And he was aloof from the ship [i. e. the ark],<br>\
or from the religion of his father. (O, TA.) And<br>\
one says, أَنَا عَنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ بِمَعْزِلٍ [I am aloof<br>\
from this affair]. (S, O.) And فُلَانٌ عَنِ الحَقِّ<br>\
بِمَعْزِلٍ Such a one is aloof from the truth. (Msb.)<br>\
مِعْزَالٌ A pastor who goes apart, or aside, with<br>\
his cattle, and pastures them in a place remote, or<br>\
separate, from men, or the people: (S, O:) or a<br>\
pastor apart from others (K, TA) with his camels<br>\
depasturing the herbage not previously pastured<br>\
upon and seeking successively the places where<br>\
rain had fallen: in this sense not an epithet<br>\
of discommendation, for the doing thus is an act<br>\
of the courageous and valiant of men: (TA:)<br>\
pl. مَعَازِيلُ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And One who alights apart,<br>\
or aloof, from the company of travellers; (K,<br>\
TA; [من السَّفَرِ in the CK should be مِنَ السَّفْرِ;])<br>\
who alights by himself; in which sense it is an<br>\
epithet of discommendation. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And One<br>\
who separates himself from the players at the game<br>\
called المَيْسِر, by reason of meanness. (S, O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And One who is alone in his opinion, having<br>\
no one to share with him in it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See<br>\
also أَعْزَلُ in two places. ―<br>\
-b6-  Also Weak and<br>\
stupid. (S, O, K.)<br>\
مَعْزُولٌ [pass. part. n. of عَزَلَهُ; Put, or set, apart,<br>\
away, or aside; &amp;c.]. إِنَّهُمْ عَنِ السَّمْعِ لَمَعْزُولُونَ,<br>\
in the Kur [xxvi. 212], means Verily they are<br>\
debarred, or precluded, from hearing [the speech<br>\
of the angels]. (TA.)<br>\
المُعْتَزِلَةُ A sect of the قَدَرِيَّة [q. v.], who asserted<br>\
that they seceded from what were in their estimation the two parties of error, the people of the سُنَّة<br>\
and خَوَارِج: (O, K:) [therefore they were thus<br>\
called, i. e. the Seceders:] or they were thus called<br>\
by El-Hasan (K, TA) Ibn-Yesár El-Basree<br>\
(TA) when Wásil Ibn-&#39;Atà and his companions<br>\
withdrew from him to one of the columns of the<br>\
mosque, [agreeably with a common practice of<br>\
lecturers in a mosque, each of them seating himself on the ground at the foot of a column, while<br>\
his hearers, with him, seated also on the ground,<br>\
form a ring,] and he (i. e. Wásil, TA) began to<br>\
establish the dictum of the condition between the two<br>\
conditions, that the committer of a great sin is not<br>\
a believer absolutely (K, TA) nor an unbeliever<br>\
absolutely (K, TA, but not in the CK,) but between the two conditions: (K, TA:) and they are<br>\
also called ↓ العُزَّالُ. (TA.)<br>\
