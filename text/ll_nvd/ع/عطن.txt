عَطَنَتِ الإِبِلُ (S, Msb, K) or عَطَنَتِ الإِبِلُ<br>\
عَلَى المَآءِ, (TA,) aor.<br>\
عَطِنَ and<br>\
عَطُنَ, inf. n. عُطُونٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) The camels lay down [at the water]<br>\
after having satisfied their thirst; (S, Msb, * K;)<br>\
as also ↓ عَطَّنَت: (K:) and العُطُونُ, (K, TA,) it<br>\
is said, (TA,) signifies the resting, or the driving<br>\
back to the nightly resting-place, a she-camel after<br>\
her drinking: (K, TA:) or the bringing her back<br>\
to the عَطَن [q. v.], waiting in expectation with<br>\
her, because she did not drink the first time, (so<br>\
in the K accord. to the TA, but in the CK,<br>\
agreeably with the S, this last meaning is<br>\
made to relate to 4, q. v.,) then offering her the<br>\
water a second time: (K, TA:) or it signifies<br>\
[agreeably with the first explanation above] her<br>\
satisfying her thirst, then lying down: (K, * TA:)<br>\
in which explanation, in [some of the copies of]<br>\
the K, ثم تنرك is erroneously put for ثُمَّ تَبْرُك.<br>\
(TA.) قَدْ عَطَنُوا مَوَاشِيَهُمْ occurs in a trad. as<br>\
meaning They had rested, or had driven back to<br>\
the nightly resting-place, their cattle. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
عَطَنَ الجِلْدَ, aor.<br>\
عَطِنَ (S, K) and<br>\
عَطُنَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
عَطْنٌ, (S,) He took عَلْقَى, which is a certain<br>\
plant, (S,) so says J, but, as &#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh<br>\
says, it is the غَلْقَة, a well-known plant, not the<br>\
عَلْقَى, that is used for this purpose, (IB, TA,)<br>\
[or perhaps عَلْقَى is a mistranscription for غَلْقَى,<br>\
which is said in the K in art. غلق to be a syn. of<br>\
غَلْقَةٌ,] or فَرْث [i. e. the feces thus termed], or<br>\
salt, and threw the skin into it, and covered it<br>\
over, in order that its wool might become dissundered and loose; after which it is thrown into the<br>\
tan: (S:) or, as also ↓ عطّنهُ, he put the skin into<br>\
the tan, and left it so that it became corrupt and<br>\
stinking: (K:) or he sprinkled water upon it, (K,<br>\
TA,) and folded it, (TA,) and buried it (K, TA)<br>\
for a day and a night, (TA,) so that its hair<br>\
(K, TA) or its wool, (TA,) became loose; in<br>\
order that it might be plucked off; (K, TA;)<br>\
and that it [the skin] might be then thrown into<br>\
the tan, it being then stinking in the utmost<br>\
degree: (TA:) or العَتْنُ signifies the putting [a<br>\
skin] into the tan. (Az, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  عَطِنَ, aor.<br>\
عَطَنَ,<br>\
(S, K,) inf. n. عَطَنٌ, (S,) said of a hide, It became stinking, and its wool fell off, in the process<br>\
termed عَطْن [expl. above]: (AZ, S, TA:) or it<br>\
was put into the tan, and left so that it became<br>\
corrupt and stinking: (K:) or water was sprinkled<br>\
upon it, (K, TA,) and it was folded, (TA,) and<br>\
buried (K, TA) for a day and a night, (TA,) so<br>\
that its hair (K, TA) or its wool (TA) became<br>\
loose; in order that it might be plucked off; (K,<br>\
TA;) and that it [the skin] might be then thrown<br>\
into the tan, it being then stinking in the utmost<br>\
degree: (TA:) and ↓ انعطن signifies the same:<br>\
(S, K:) or this signifies it (a skin) became loose<br>\
in its wool without becoming corrupt. (AHn,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
عطّن, inf. n. تَعْطِينٌ, He made for himself<br>\
an عَطَن [q. v.]: (K, TA:) like as one says of a<br>\
bird عشّش, meaning “ he made for himself an<br>\
عُشّ ” [i. e. “ a nest ”]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عطّنت الإِبِلُ:<br>\
see 1, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-  عطّن الجِلْدَ: see 1, near<br>\
the middle.<br>\

اعطن القَوْمُ means عَطَنَتْ إِبِلُهُمْ [The people,<br>\
or party, had their camels lying down at the water<br>\
after having satisfied their thirst: see 1, first<br>\
sentence]. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  اعطن الإِبِلَ He watered<br>\
the camels and then made them to lie down [at the<br>\
water]: (S, TA:) or he confined the camels at the<br>\
water, and they lay down, after having come to it<br>\
[and drunk], (K, TA,) in order that they might<br>\
drink again: (TA:) this the Arabs do only in<br>\
the intense heats of summer; not when the season<br>\
becomes cool: (Msb:) or they do this only when<br>\
the asterism of the Pleiades (الثُّرَيَّا) rises [auro-<br>\
rally, i. e. about the middle of May, O. S.], and<br>\
men return from the seeking after herbage to the<br>\
places of waters, or of constant sources of water:<br>\
they do so only on the day of the camels&#39; coming<br>\
to the water; and they cease not to do thus [when<br>\
necessary] until the time of the [auroral] rising<br>\
of Canopus (سُهَيْل [i. e. early in August, O. S.]),<br>\
in the خَرِيف, [app. here meaning the period of<br>\
the rain so called, (see the latter of the two tables<br>\
in page 1254,)] after which they do it not, but<br>\
the camels come to the water and drink their<br>\
draught and return from the water: (Az, TA:)<br>\
or اعطن الإِبِلَ signifies he brought back the camels<br>\
to the عَطَن [q. v.], waiting in expectation with<br>\
them, because they did not drink the first time.<br>\
(So in the CK [agreeably with what here follows;<br>\
but see 1, first sentence].) And one says, اعطن<br>\
الرَّجُلُ بَعِيرَهُ The man brought back his camel to<br>\
the عَطَن, waiting in expectation with him, he not<br>\
having drunk. (S.)<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْعَطَنَ see 1, last sentence.<br>\
عَطَنٌ and ↓ مَعْطِنٌ (ISk, S, Mgh, Msb, K) or<br>\
مَعْطَنٌ (TA [but this I find not elsewhere]) The<br>\
usual abiding-place of camels: (K:) and also,<br>\
(K, TA,) by predominance of usage, (TA,) or<br>\
only, (Az, Msb, TA,) the place of camels, where<br>\
they lie down, (Az, S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) at the<br>\
water, (Az, S, TA,) or around the water, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) or around the watering-trough, (K, TA,)<br>\
in order that they may drink a second time, after<br>\
the first draught, and then be sent back to the<br>\
places of pasture to remain there during the intervals between the waterings; (S;) and likewise<br>\
the places of sheep or goats, where they lie down<br>\
around the water: (ISk, S, Msb, K, TA:) pl. of<br>\
the former أَعْطَانٌ; and of the latter ↓ مَعَاطِنُ;<br>\
(Az, S, Mgh, Msb, K;) which latter pl. is used<br>\
by the lawyers as meaning [generally] the places<br>\
of lying down of camels. (Msb.) The [space<br>\
called] حَرِيم [q. v.] of the well of the عَطَن is<br>\
said to be forty cubits. (Mgh.) Prayer in the<br>\
أَعْطَان of camels is forbidden, because the person<br>\
praying is not secure from being hurt by them,<br>\
and diverted from his prayer, and defiled by the<br>\
sprinkling of their urine. (IAth, TA.) ضَرَبَتِ<br>\
الإِبِلُ بِعَطَنٍ [in which الأَرْضَ is understood after<br>\
الابل] means The camels lay down [in a place by<br>\
the water]: (S:) or satisfied themselves with<br>\
drinking and then lay down around the water or<br>\
by the watering-troughs, to be brought again to<br>\
drink another time. (IAth, TA.) And one says,<br>\
ضَرَبَتِ النَّاقَةُ بِعَطَنٍ The she-camel lay down [&amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.) And ضَرَبَ النَّاسُ بِعَطَنٍ (assumed tropical:)  The people&#39;s<br>\
camels satisfied themselves with drinking until they<br>\
lay down and remained in their place [at the<br>\
water]; occurring in a trad.: (TA in art. ضرب:)<br>\
or the people satisfied their thirst and then abode<br>\
at the water. (K and TA in the present art.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence] one says, فُلَانٌ وَاسِعُ العَطَنِ وَالبَلَدِ, (S,)<br>\
or رَحْبُ العَطَنِ, (K, TA,) (tropical:)  Such a one is a<br>\
person possessing much wealth; having an ample<br>\
dwelling or place of abode; (K, TA;) endowed<br>\
with extensive power or strength or might; or<br>\
liberal, munificent, or generous. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
And العَطَنُ signifies العِرْضُ [app. as meaning<br>\
Odour, from the same word as inf. n. of عَطِنَ<br>\
said of a hide]: so in the saying of &#39;Adee Ibn-Zeyd, cited by Sh,<br>\
طَاهِرُ الأَثْوَابِ يَحْمِى عِرْضَهُ<br>\
مِنْ حَنَا الذِّمَّةِ أَوْ طَمْثِ العَطَنْ<br>\
[Pure in conduct, or actions; he guards his<br>\
honour, or reputation, from unseemliness in respect<br>\
of that which should be held sacred, or inviolable,<br>\
or filthiness of odour]. (TA)<br>\
عَطِنٌ part. n. of عَطِنَ [q. v.] said of a hide.<br>\
(S, TA.) [Hence,] أُهُبٌ عَطِنَةٌ Stinking hides.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عَطَنَةٌ a subst. from أَعْطَنَ الإِبِلَ [q. v., as such<br>\
signifying The watering of camels and then<br>\
making them to lie down at the water: or the<br>\
confining of camels at the water, where they lie<br>\
down, after having come to it and drunk]. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The place of [the operation termed]<br>\
العَطْن [inf. n. of عَطَنَ in the phrase عَطَنَ الجِلْدَ,<br>\
q. v.]. (AZ, TA.)<br>\
عِطَانٌ Feces such as are termed فَرْث, or salt, which<br>\
one puts in, or upon, a hide, [in preparing it for<br>\
tanning,] in order that it may not stink. (K.)<br>\
عَطِينٌ i. q. مَعْطُونٌ, q. v., applied to a skin.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (hence, TA), as also ↓ عَطِينَةٌ, applied to a man, Stinking (K, TA) in the exterior<br>\
of the skin: or the latter, blamed in respect of<br>\
some foul affair. (TA.)<br>\
عَطِينَةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
عَاطِنَةٌ, (S, K,) applied to a she-camel, (K,) or<br>\
to camels, (S, Msb,) as also [the pls.] عَوَاطِنُ (S,<br>\
Msb, K) and عُطُونٌ, (K,) but not عُطَّانٌ thus<br>\
applied, (TA,) Lying down [at the water] after<br>\
having satisfied her, or their, thirst. (S, Msb, *<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عُطَّانٌ and عُطُونٌ and عَطَنَةٌ (K, TA)<br>\
and عَاطِنُونَ (TA) [all pls. of عَاطِنٌ] Men who<br>\
have alighted, or descended and abode, in مَعَاطِن<br>\
[pl. of مَعْطِنٌ]. (K, TA.)<br>\
مَعْطِنٌ; and its pl. مَعَاطِنُ: see عَطَنٌ.<br>\
مَعْطُونٌ A skin prepared for tanning in the<br>\
manner signified by the phrase عَطَنَ الجِلْدَ, expl.<br>\
above; (S, K;) as also ↓ عَطِينٌ. (K.)<br>\
