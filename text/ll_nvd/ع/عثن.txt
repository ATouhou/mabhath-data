one of the dial. vars. occurs in the Kur ii. 57;<br>\
&amp;c.: some say that عثا, aor. يعثا, [or عِثَى, aor.<br>\
يَعْثَى,] is formed by transposition from عَاثَ, aor.<br>\
يَعِيثُ: (TA:) accord. to Er-Rághib, عَيْثٌ and<br>\
عُثِىٌّ, or عِثِىٌّ, and عُثُوٌّ are nearly alike; but عَيْثٌ<br>\
is mostly used in relation to that which is<br>\
perceived by sense; and عثىّ and عثوّ, in relation<br>\
to that which is perceived by the [mind or]<br>\
judgment: some say that عثوّ [as also عثىّ] is the<br>\
acting wrongfully, injuriously, or unjustly; and<br>\
sometimes does not involve the acting corruptly:<br>\
(MF and TA in art. عيث:) Lh says that عَثِىَ<br>\

-b2-  And, metaphorically, (tropical:)  Such as is straggling, of plants, or<br>\
herbage; as the نَصِىّ, and the بُهْمَى, and the<br>\
صِلِّيَان. (TA.) And [hence] one says, شَابَ<br>\
عُثَى الأَرْضِ (assumed tropical:)  The plants, or herbage, of the earth,<br>\
dried up, or became yellow: (K:) so in the Tekmileh, and so says ISk. (TA.)<br>\

below the ear or to the shoulder]: (K:) pl. عُثًى,<br>\
like رُبًى; (so in some copies of the K;) or عُثَّى,<br>\

(so in my MS. copy of the K; [app. taken from<br>\
the TA; the first of which (i. e. عُثًى) I hold<br>\
to be the right; (see the paragraph next preceding this;) though SM says what here<br>\
follows;]) it is correctly عِثى, like إِلى; agreeably with what is said in the M, i. e. that<br>\

أَعْثَى Having much hair; (S, K;) sometimes<br>\
applied in this sense to a man. (S.) And<br>\
Having a thick beard. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The<br>\
male hyena; (S, K;) as also ↓ عِثْيَانٌ: (S:)<br>\
and [the fem.] عَثْوَآءُ the female hyena; (S,<br>\
K;) because of the abundance of her hair: (S:)<br>\
and [the pl.] عُثْوٌ, and عُثْىٌ, a number of hyenas<br>\
together. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [The fem.] عَثْوَآءُ is also an<br>\
appellation applied to An old woman. (S, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And the masc. signifies also Thick, gross, or<br>\
