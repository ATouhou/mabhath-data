i. q. مَنَعَ [as meaning He, or it, prevented, or<br>\
hindered: or, as is generally the case, defended,<br>\
or protected]: (K, TA:) this is [said to be] the<br>\
primary signification: (TA: [but see عِصْمَةٌ])<br>\
and he, or it, preserved, or kept; syn. وَقَى: (K,<br>\
TA:) and it withheld (أَمْسَكَ) a thing. (TA.)<br>\
One says, عَصَمَهُ الطَّعَامُ [for عَصَمَهُ مِنَ الجُوعِ]<br>\
The food prevented him, or defended him, (مَنَعَهُ,)<br>\
from being hungry. (S, K.) And عَصَمَهُ اللّٰهُ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, TA,) aor. as above, (Msb, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
عِصْمَةٌ, (Mgh,) or this is a simple subst., (Msb,)<br>\
and the inf. n. is عَصْمٌ, (TA,) God defended, or<br>\
protected, him; (TA;) or preserved him; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA;) مِنَ السُّوْءِ [from evil], (Mgh,) or<br>\
مِنَ المَكْرُوهِ [from what was disliked, or hated].<br>\
(Msb.) And عَصَمْتُهُ I [defended, or protected,<br>\
him; or] preserved him. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,]<br>\
عَصَمَ القِرْبَةَ, (K, TA,) aor.<br>\
عَصِمَ, inf. n. عَصْمٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He put, or made, to the water-skin, an عِصَام;<br>\
(K, TA;) as also ↓ أَعْصَمَهَا: (ISk, S, K, TA:)<br>\

(K,) he bound it with the عِصَام, (K, TA,) i. e.<br>\
the [tie called] وِكَآء [which is bound round its<br>\
head to confine the contents]. (TA.)<br>\

-A3-  عَصَمَ, aor.<br>\
عَصِمَ, (S, K,) inf. n. عَصْمٌ, (S,)<br>\
signifies also اِكْتَسَبَ [i. e. he gained, or earned;<br>\
or he sought means of subsistence]. (S, K.)<br>\

عَصَمَ, (K, TA,) inf. n. عَصَمٌ, (S, * TA,)<br>\
said of a gazelle, and of a mountain-goat, [and<br>\

(K, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اعصم He exerted his strength, and laid hold,<br>\
or fast hold, upon a thing, or clung to it, lest his<br>\
horse, or his camel, should throw him down; [or<br>\
rather اعصم بِشَىْءٍ has this meaning, or he laid<br>\
hold, or fast hold, upon a thing, or clung to it;]<br>\
and in like manner one says بِهِ ↓ اعتصم, and<br>\
به ↓ استعصم; (S;) بِهِ ↓ اعتصم is said by Er-Rághib, to signify thus; whence, in the Kur<br>\
[iii. 98], بِحَبْلِ اللّٰهِ ↓ وَاعْتَصمُوا [expl. in art. حبل]:<br>\
(TA:) and [hence, likewise,] اعصم بِحَبْلِهِ signifies تَمَسَّكَ بِهِ [meaning He held fast by his corenant]. (Mgh.) One says also, اعصم بِالبَعِيرِ He<br>\
laid hold upon one of the cords, or ropes, of the<br>\
camel, (K, TA,) lest the camel should throw him<br>\
down. (TA.) And اعصم بِالفَرَسِ He laid hold<br>\

-A3-  اعصم فُلَانًا He prepared for<br>\
such a one, (S, K,) in the camel&#39;s saddle, and in<br>\
the horse&#39;s saddle, (S,) a thing upon which he<br>\
might lay hold, (S, K,) lest he should fall. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  اعصم القِرْبَةَ: see 1, latter half.<br>\

unto God: (Jel in iii. 96:) or, to his religion:<br>\
or he had recourse to God for protection, in,<br>\
or in respect of, the concurrences, or combinations, of his affairs: (Bd ibid:) he confided in,<br>\
or relied upon, God, (Bd and Jel in xxii. last<br>\
verse,) in, or in respect of, the concurrences, or<br>\
combinations, of his affairs, not seeking aid from<br>\
any but Him: (Bd ibid.:) or he defended, or<br>\
preserved, himself, or he refrained, or abstained,<br>\
(اِمْتَنَعَ,) by the grace of God, (S, Msb, * K,) from<br>\
disobedience. (S, K. [See also 10.]) And ↓ عَصَمَ<br>\
إِلَيْهِ signifies the same as اعتصم بِهِ. (K.) See<br>\
also 4, latter half.<br>\
-A2-  اِعْتَصَمَتْ, said of a girl, or<br>\
young woman, [from عِصَامٌ,] She applied collyrium to her eyes. (El-Muärrij, TA.)<br>\

-b2-  Also He<br>\
defended, or preserved, himself, or he refrained,<br>\

عُصْمٌ (S, K) and ↓ عُصُمٌ (K) and ↓ عَصِيمٌ (S, K)<br>\

as tar [with which camels are smeared when<br>\
mangy], (S,) and خِضَاب [i. e. hinnà (حِنَّآء) and<br>\
the like, with which one dyes, or tinges, the hair<br>\
&amp;c.], and the like: (S, K:) and عُصْمٌ is also<br>\
expl. as signifying a trace of anything such as<br>\
وَرْس [q. v.] or saffron or the like. (TA.) As<br>\
says, I heard an Arab woman of the desert say to<br>\
her follow-wife, أَعْطِينِى عُصْمَ حنَّائِكِ, meaning<br>\
[Give me] what thou hast wiped off and cast away<br>\
of thy حِنَّآء (S, TA *) after thy dyeing of thy hands<br>\
with it. (TA.)<br>\

a bracelet: (Er-Rághib, TA:) pl. (of the latter,<br>\
TA) عِصَمٌ, and pl. pl. أَعْصُمٌ and عِصَمَةٌ [in the<br>\
CK عَصَمَةٌ, but, as is said in the TA, with kesr<br>\
and then fet-h], and pl. pl. pl. أَعْصَامٌ; (K;) or<br>\
this last, which is said in the S to be pl. of عُصْمةٌ,<br>\
and thought by ISd to be formed from عِصْمَةٌ<br>\
after rejecting the augmentative letter [ة], and<br>\
said by some to be a pl. of which the sing. is<br>\
↓ عِصْمٌ, like as أَعْدَالٌ is of عِدْلٌ, is correctly pl.<br>\
of عِصَمٌ, which is pl. of عِصْمَةٌ, (IB, TA.) of<br>\
which أَعْصِمَةٌ is also a pl. [of pauc.] (TA.) And<br>\
أَعْصَامٌ signifies also The straps (عَذَبَات) that are<br>\
upon the necks of dogs: and the sing, is عُصْمَةٌ,<br>\
and, (K, TA,) some say, (TA,) ↓ عِصَامٌ, (K,<br>\
TA,) with kesr, [in the CK عَصامٌ,] mentioned by<br>\
Lth. (TA.) [Hence,] one says, دَفَعْتُهُ إِلَيْهِ بِعُصْمَتِهِ<br>\
and ↓ بِعِصَامِهِ [i. e. I gave it to him altogether];<br>\
like as one says, بِرُمَّتِهِ [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
The quality denoted by the epithet أَعْصَمُ [q. v.]:<br>\
(S, K:) ISh says, it is in the arm of the gazelle<br>\
and of the mountain-goat: and IAar says, it is<br>\
in cloven-hoofed animals in the fare legs; and in<br>\
the crow, in the shanks; and sometimes, he says,<br>\
it is in horses. (TA.)<br>\
عِصْمَةٌ [mentioned in the Mgh as an inf. n., but<br>\
said in the Msb to be a simple subst.,] primarily<br>\
(TA) signifies مَنْعٌ [as meaning Prevention, or<br>\
hindrance: or, as seems to be indicated by most<br>\
of its subordinate applications, defence, or protection]: (S, K, TA:) or, as some say, its primary signification is the act of tying, or binding;<br>\
and hence the meaning of مَنْعٌ: or, accord. to Zj,<br>\
it primarily signifies حَبْلٌ [i. e. a rope, or cord];<br>\
and accord. to Mohammad Ibn-Neshwán El-<br>\
Himyeree, سَبَبٌ and حَبْلٌ [which mean the same].<br>\
(TA.) Defence, or protection, (TA,) or preservation, (S, Msb, K,) [in an absolute sense, and] as<br>\

would cause destruction of a man. (TA.) عِصْمَةُ<br>\
الأَنْبِيَآءِ signifies God&#39;s preservation of the prophets;<br>\
first, by the peculiar endowment of them with<br>\
essential purity of constitution; then, by the conferring of large and highly-esteemed excellences;<br>\
then, by aid against opponents, and rendering their<br>\
feet firm; then, by sending down upon them tranquillity (السَّكِينَة, q. v.), [see the Kur ix. 26, &amp;c.,]<br>\
and the preservation of their hearts, or minds,<br>\
and adaptation to that which is right. (Er-Rá-<br>\
ghib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also [A defence as meaning] a<br>\
defender from a state of perdition and from want:<br>\
so in a saying of Aboo-Tálib, in praise of the<br>\
Prophet, cited voce ثِمَالٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A<br>\
faculty of avoiding, or shunning, acts of disobedience, [or of self-preservation therefrom,] with<br>\
possession of power to commit them: (El-Muná-<br>\
wee, TA:) [or,] as used by the Muslim theologians, inability to disobey: or a disposition that<br>\
prevents [disobedience], not such as constrains<br>\
[to act]. (MF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عِصْمَةُ النِّكَاحِ means The<br>\
tie, or bond, of marriage: [also called, in the<br>\
present day, عِصْمَةُ المَرْأَةِ i. e. the woman&#39;s matrimonial tie or bond, which is in her husband&#39;s<br>\
hand, or power: a term used by the lawyers:]<br>\
one says, بِيَدِهِ عِصْمَةُ النِّكَاحِ i. e. [In his hand, or<br>\
power, is] the tie, or bond, of marriage: pl.<br>\
عِصَمٌ: whence, in the Kur [lx. 10], وَلَا تُمَسِّكُوا<br>\
بِعِصَمِ الكَوَافِرِ [And hold ye not to the matrimonial<br>\
ties, or bonds, of the unbelieving women; meaning<br>\
divorce ye such women: but the common reading<br>\
is ولا تُمْسِكُوا, which signifies the same]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  See also عُصْمَةٌ.<br>\
عِصَامٌ The tie of a قِرْبَة [or water-skin]; (S,<br>\
Msb;) [i. e.] its [tie called] وَكَآء [which is bound<br>\
round the head to confine the contents]: (TA:)<br>\
and the strap that is used for the carrying thereof:<br>\
(S, Msb:) or a cord that is used for the tying, or<br>\
binding, of the leathern bucket and of the water-skin and of the [leathern vessel for water called]<br>\
إِدَاوَة: and the loop-shaped handle that serves for<br>\
the suspending of the [bag, or other receptacle,<br>\
for travelling-provisions or for goods or utensils<br>\
&amp;c. called] وِعَآء: (K:) and anything that serves<br>\
for the protection, or preservation, of a thing:<br>\
(TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَعْصِمَةٌ and [of mult.] عُصْمٌ,<br>\
(K, TA,) or عُصُمٌ, (Msb, and so in some copies<br>\
of the K,) and عِصَامٌ, like the sing., of the class of<br>\
دِلَاصٌ: (AZ, K:) but Az states, as what had<br>\
been heard [app. by him] from the Arabs, respecting the عُصْم of [the leathern water-bags called]<br>\
مَزَاد, that they are the cords that are fixed in the<br>\
loops of the pairs of water-bags, and with which<br>\
they are tied when they are bound upon the back<br>\
of the camel; after which the [rope called] رِوَآء is<br>\
bound over them: they are erroneously said by<br>\
Lth to be the طَرَائِق [app. meaning borders] of<br>\
the extremity of the مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag],<br>\
at the place of the كُلْيَة [or kidney-shaped piece<br>\
of leather to which a loop is sewed]. (TA. [See<br>\
also خُصْمٌ.]) Mention is made, in a trad., of a<br>\
place where a camel was shackled with عُصْم, as<br>\
meaning that its abundance of herbage confined<br>\
him so that he would not go away in search of<br>\
pasturage. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The cord, or bond, of<br>\
the [vehicle called] مَحْمِل, (K, * TA,) which is<br>\
bound at the extremity of [each of the transverse<br>\
pieces of wood called] the عَارِضَانِ [correctly<br>\
عَارِضَتَانِ], in the upper part of each of these: [for,]<br>\
as Lth says, there are two of such cords, or bonds:<br>\
and Az says that the عِصَامَانِ of the مَحْمِل are<br>\
like those of the [pair of leathern water-bags<br>\
called] مَزَادَتَانِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The slender part<br>\
of the end of the tail; (M, K;) and عِضَامٌ is a<br>\
dial. var. thereof: (TA: [but see the latter:])<br>\
or the tail with its hair and its عَسِيب [q. v.]:<br>\
(ISh, TA:) pl. أَعْصِمَةٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also عُصْمَةٌ,<br>\
in two places. ―<br>\
-b5-  Also Collyrium: (K, TA:)<br>\

called because it defends and strengthens the eye.<br>\

عَصُومٌ Edacious; voracious; (K, TA;) applied to a she-camel; (TA;) and ↓ عَيْصُومٌ signifies the same, (K, TA,) applied to a human<br>\
being, male and female; (TA;) the latter occurring in the saying of a rájiz, applied to an old<br>\
woman, (S, TA,) and said to have this meaning,<br>\
(S,) but as some relate it, the word is there with<br>\
ض; (S, TA;) and عَيْضُومٌ signifies thus accord.<br>\
to Kr, applied to a woman: عَيْصُومٌ, however,<br>\
is of higher authority: (TA in art. عضم:) ↓ عَيْصَامٌ<br>\
also signifies the same, applied to a man. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also A female whose family, or household,<br>\
have become numerous. (Az, TA.)<br>\

falls off (إِذَا انْتَسَلَ [perhaps a mistranscription<br>\
for اذا أَنْسَلَ]). (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And The leaves of trees.<br>\
(IB, TA.)<br>\
عِصَامِىٌّ [a rel. n. used as meaning Of the class<br>\
of &#39;Isám; and hence, self-ennobled]. عِصَامٌ is the<br>\
name of a chamberlain of En-Noamán Ibn-ElMundhir: and [in relation to him] it is said<br>\
in a prov., كُنْ عِصَامِيًّا وَلَا تَكُنْ عِظَامِيًّا, (S, K,<br>\
TA,) [the former clause meaning Be thou of the<br>\
class of &#39;Isám, i. e. be thou self-ennobled, and] the<br>\
latter clause meaning and be not of those who<br>\
glory in old and wasted and crumbling bones,<br>\
[i. e. in their ancestors,] (TA,) alluding to his<br>\
saying, [so in the S and K and TA, but correctly<br>\
the saying of En-Nábighah, (see Har p. 297,)]<br>\
نَفْسُ عِصَامٍ سَوَّدَتْ عِصَامَا<br>\
وَعَلَّمَتْهُ الكَرَّ وَالإِقْدَامَا<br>\
[The soul of &#39;Isám ennobled &#39;Isám, and taught him<br>\
the art of attack, and boldness]. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
And [hence] one says also, فُلَانٌ عِصَامِىٌّ وَعِظَامِىٌّ<br>\
i. e. Such a one is noble in respect of soul, or self,<br>\
and of origin. (A, TA.)<br>\
عَاصِمٌ [act. part. n. of عَصَمَ, signifying] Defending [&amp;c.], or a defender [&amp;c.]. (TA.) لَا<br>\
عَاصِمَ اليَوْمَ مِنْ أَمْرِاللّٰهِ, in the Kur [xi. 45], may<br>\
mean There is no defender [this day from the<br>\
decree of God]: (TA:) or the meaning may be,<br>\
no [person] defended: or no possessor of defence:<br>\
(S, TA:) so that عاصم may be an instance of<br>\
فَاعِل in the sense of مَفْعُوا: (S:) or it may thus<br>\
be a possessive epithet. (TA. [See also دَافِقٌ.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] العَاصِمَةُ is a name of El-Medeeneh.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَبُو عَاصِمٍ is an appellation of The meal<br>\
of parched barley or the like (السَّوِيق). (S, K.)<br>\

أَعْصَمُ A gazelle, and a mountain-goat, having<br>\
in his arms, (As, T, S, K,) or in one of them,<br>\
(AO, S, M, K,) a whiteness, (S, K,) the rest of<br>\
him being red or black: (K:) or a goat white in<br>\
the fore legs, or in the fore leg: (Az, TA:) fem.<br>\
عَصْمَآءُ: (S, K:) and pl. عُصْمٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A<br>\
horse white in the fore leg: (As, TA:) or having<br>\
a whiteness in one of his fore legs, above the pastern: (ISh, TA:) or having a whiteness in his<br>\
fore shanks: (Ham p. 18:) or having a whiteness<br>\
in one of his fore legs, (S, TA,) but not in his hind<br>\
legs, (TA,) little or much; in which case he is termed<br>\
أَعْصَمُ اليُمْنَى or اليُسْرَى [white in respect of the<br>\
right fore leg or of the left]: when the whiteness is<br>\
in both of his fore legs, he is termed أَعْصَمُ اليَدَيْنِ<br>\
[white in respect of the two fore legs]; unless having<br>\
a blaze in his face, in which case he is termed<br>\
مُحَجَّلٌ, not أَعْصَمُ; (S, TA;) though a blaze<br>\
in his face does not cause him to be termed<br>\
مُحَجَّلٌ when the whiteness is in one fore leg.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A crow having a white feather in its<br>\
wing; (S, K; [in some copies of the K, in its<br>\
two wings;]) i. e., in one of its wings: (TA:)<br>\
because the wing of the bird corresponds to the<br>\
fore leg [of the beast]: (S, TA:) or white in the<br>\
wings: (ISh, IAth, TA:) or white in the legs:<br>\
(TA:) or red (أَحْمَر) in the legs and beak; (Az,<br>\
K, TA;) and this is said by Az to be the correct<br>\
explanation; [but] he adds that the Arabs term<br>\
بَيَاض [i. e. whiteness] حَمْرَة [which properly signifies redness], saying of a woman of white complexion that she is حَمْرَآء: [so that by the last of<br>\
the foregoing explanations of أَعْصَمُ applied to a<br>\
crow is app. meant white in the legs and beak:]<br>\
the Prophet is said to have explained this epithet,<br>\
thus applied, as meaning of which one of the legs<br>\
is white: (TA:) some say that الغُرَابُ الأَعْصَمُ is<br>\
like الأَبْلَقُ العَقُوقُ and بَيْضُ الأَنوقِ, applied to<br>\
anything that is rarely found: (S, TA:) it occurs<br>\
in a number of trads.; and a righteous woman<br>\
is likened thereto. (TA.)<br>\
مِعْصَمٌ The part, of the fore arm, which is the<br>\
place of the bracelet; (S, Msb, K;) [the wrist:<br>\
pl. مَعَاصِمُ:] in a citation from a poet (voce عَرَقَ),<br>\
المَعَاصِيم is used by poetic license for المَعَاصِم.<br>\
(L in art. عرق.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The يَد [meaning arm];<br>\
(K, TA;) used in this sense in a verse of ElAashà. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, thus without the article<br>\
ال, a name for The she-goat; which is called to<br>\
