اعنم He pastured upon, or depastured, the<br>\
species of tree called عَنَم. (AA, K, * TA.)<br>\
عَنَمٌ A certain tree of El-Hijáz, having a red<br>\
fruit, to which are likened the dyed fingers or<br>\
ends of fingers: (IAar, K:) in the “ Nawádir ”<br>\
said to be sappy, or tender, branches, that grow<br>\
upon the trunks of the [trees called] عِضَاه, not<br>\
resembling the other branches thereof, red in colour,<br>\
the upper parts of the blossoms of which divide into<br>\
four divisions, like a branch of an أَرَاكَة [n. un.<br>\
of أَرَاكٌ, q. v.]; coming forth in winter and in<br>\
summer: (IDrd, TA:) or a species of trees having<br>\
tender branches, to which are likened the fingers,<br>\
or the ends of the fingers, of girls, or young<br>\
women: (S:) in the “ Book of Plants ” [of AHn]<br>\
said to be a small tree that grows in the midst, or<br>\
interior part, of the سَمُرَة [or gum-acacia-tree],<br>\
having a red fruit: (TA:) or, accord. to AA,<br>\
the [fruit called] زُعْرُور [q. v.]: (TA, and so in<br>\
a copy of the S:) or, (S, K, TA,) as AO says,<br>\
(S, TA,) the extremities of the Syrian خَرُّوب [or<br>\
locust-tree]: (S, K, TA:) and he says that a verse<br>\
of En-Nábighah is recited thus:<br>\
بِمُخَضَّبٍ رَخْصٍ كَأَنَّ بَنَانَهُ<br>\
عَنَمٌ عَلَى أَغْصَانِهِ لَمْ يُعْقَدِ<br>\
[With a dyed member (عُضْوٍ being understood,<br>\
instead of كَفٍّ, because the latter is fem.,) soft,<br>\
or tender, as though its fingers, or its fingers&#39; ends,<br>\
were &#39;anam upon their branches, not yet compactly<br>\
organized]; which shows that it means a plant,<br>\
not a worm: (S, TA:) [for] it is said to signify<br>\
a species of red worm, found in sand: (Ham<br>\
p. 288, in which are other explanations, nearly<br>\
agreeing with some here:) or, as some say, the<br>\
fruit of the عَوْسَج [or box-thorn], which is red,<br>\
and then becomes black when thoroughly ripe;<br>\
therefore En-Nábighah says لَمْ يُعْقَد, meaning<br>\
that had not yet become ripe: (IB, TA; and also<br>\
inserted in the text of a copy of the S:) and, (K,<br>\
TA,) as AHn says in one instance, (TA,) threads<br>\
[or tendrils] by means of which the vine clings to<br>\
its trellises: (K, TA:) and (accord. to Lth, TA)<br>\
the thorns of the طَلْح [or acacia gummifera];<br>\
(K, TA;) but this is said by Az to be incorrect:<br>\
(TA:) [see also a hemistich cited voce طَرَفٌ:]<br>\
the n. un. is ↓ عَنَمَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
عَنَمَةٌ: see what immediately precedes.<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
A species of the [sort of lizard called] وَزَغ; (K,<br>\
TA;) accord. to Lth; but this is rejected, as<br>\
incorrect, by Az: it is said to be like the عَظَاية,<br>\
except that it is more white and more comely.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, (accord. to copies of the K,) or<br>\
عَنْمَةٌ, (accord. to the TA,) A fissure in the lip of<br>\
a human being. (K.)<br>\
عَنَمِىٌّ A beautiful red face; (K, TA;) tinged<br>\
over with redness. (TA.)<br>\
عَيْنُومٌ The male frog. (K.)<br>\
بَنَانٌ مُعَنَّمٌ [Fingers, or fingers&#39; ends,] dyed, or<br>\
tinged [with hinnà or the like]. (IJ, S, K.)<br>\
