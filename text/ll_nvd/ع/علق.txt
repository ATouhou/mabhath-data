عَلِقَ بِهِ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, TA,) aor.<br>\
عَلَقَ,<br>\
(Msb,) inf. n. عَلَقٌ (S, O, Msb, KL, TA) and<br>\
عَلقَةٌ (L, TA) [and app. عُلُوقٌ also, as will be<br>\
seen from what follows]; and ↓ تعلّق, (S, MA,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb,) and ↓ اعتلق; (O, Msb, KL;) It<br>\
hung to it; it was, or became, suspended to it:<br>\
(so the first and last accord. to the KL, and the<br>\
second accord. to the MA and common usage:<br>\
[in the S and Mgh and O, it is merely said that<br>\
the first and second signify the same:]) [and] it<br>\
clung, caught, clave, adhered, held, or stuck fast,<br>\
to it; (Msb in explanation of all, and TA * in<br>\
explanation of the first;) and so ↓ تعلّقهُ. (S, * O, *<br>\
TA.) It is said in a prov., (S, O, TA,) asserted<br>\
in the K to have been mentioned before, which is<br>\
not found to be the case, (TA,)<br>\
وَصَرَّ الجُنْدَبُ ↓ عَلِقَتْ مَعَالِقَهَا<br>\
(S, O, K, [in the CK, erroneously, مُعالِقَها,]) [It<br>\
(the bucket, الدَّلْوُ, Z, TA) has become suspended<br>\
in its places of suspension, and the جندب (accord.<br>\
to the S and K a species of locust) has creaked]:<br>\
originating from the fact that a man went to a<br>\
well, and suspended his well-rope to the rope<br>\
thereof, and then went to the owner of the well,<br>\
and claimed to be his neighbour [and therefore to<br>\
have a right to the use of the well]; but the<br>\
owner refused his assent, and ordered him to<br>\
depart; whereupon he uttered these words, meaning The heat has come, [see صَرَّ الجُنْدَبُ in art.<br>\
جدب,] and I am not able to depart. (S, O. [See<br>\
more in Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 91.]) And one<br>\
says, عَلِقَ الشَّوْكُ بِالثَّوْبِ, aor.<br>\
عَلَقَ, inf. n. عَلَقٌ; and<br>\
بِهِ ↓ تعلّق; meaning The thorns clung, caught, &amp;c.,<br>\
to the garment. (Msb.) And ظُفْرِى بِالشَّىْءِ ↓ اعتلق<br>\
My nail clung, caught, &amp;c., to the thing. (Msb.)<br>\
And عَلِقَ الظَّبْىُ فِى الحِبَالَةِ, (S, O,) or الصَّيْدُ;<br>\
(K;) or عَلِقَ الوَحْشُ بِالْحِبَالَةِ, inf. n. عُلُوقٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
[The gazelle, or the animal of the chase, became<br>\
caught, or stuck fast, in the snare; or the wild<br>\
animal became caught, or held fast, thereby, or]<br>\
became withheld from getting loose [thereby]:<br>\
whence the saying, عَلِقَ الخَصْمُ بِخَصْمِهِ and<br>\
بِهِ ↓ تعلّق [The antagonist became held fast, or<br>\
withheld from getting loose, by his antagonist;<br>\
and also the antagonist clung, or held fast, to his<br>\
antagonist]. (Msb.) [―<br>\
-b2-  The primary significations are those mentioned above in the first sentence: and hence several other significations here<br>\
following. ―<br>\
-b3-  عَلِقَ عَلَى كَذَا and عَلَيْهِ ↓ تعلّق It<br>\
depended upon such a thing, as a condition. ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
عَلِقَ بِهِ and ↓ تعلّق It pertained to him, or it: it<br>\
concerned him, or it. And He had a hold upon<br>\
it: he had a concern in it.] ―<br>\
-b5-  عَلِقَهَا, (S, O,) or<br>\
عَلِقَهُ, (K,) and عَلِقَ بِهَا, (S, O,) or بِهِ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
عُلُوقٌ (S, O, K) and عَلَقٌ (K [and mentioned also<br>\
in the S and O but app. as a simple subst.]) and<br>\
عِلْقٌ [but see this below voce عَلَقٌ] and عَلَاقَةٌ,<br>\
(K,) [He became attached by love to her, or to<br>\
him;] he loved (S, O, K) her, (S, O,) or him;<br>\
(K;) and so عَلِقَ حُبُّهَا بِقَلْبِهِ; (S, O;) and ↓ تعلّقها,<br>\
and تعلّق بِهَا; [the former of these two phrases<br>\
being used for the latter, agreeably with a saying<br>\
of IAmb cited in the TA in art. ارى, that تَعَلَّقْتُ<br>\
فُلَانًا is for تعلّقت بِفُلَانٍ;] like ↓ اعتلق [i. e. اعتلقها<br>\
and اعتلق بها], (K,) or اعتلقهُ, (S,) or اعتلق بِهِ;<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ عُلِّقَهَا, (S, * O, * K, TA,) from عَلَاقَةُ<br>\
الحُبِّ, (S, O, TA,) and بِهَا ↓ عُلِّقَ, (TA,) [but this<br>\
last verb is more commonly trans. by itself, for<br>\
ex.,] El-Aashà says,<br>\
عُلِّقْتُهَا عَرَضًا وَعُلِّقَتْ رَجُلًا<br>\
غَيْرِى وَعُلِّقَ أُخْرَى غَيْرَهَا الرَّجُلُ<br>\
[I became attached to her accidentally, and she<br>\
became attached to a man other than me, and the<br>\
man became attached to another female, other than<br>\
her]. (S, O. [See also another ex., in a verse of<br>\
&#39;Antarah, cited voce زَعَمَ.]) [See also عَلَقٌ, below.] ―<br>\
-b6-  ↓ عَلِقَتْ مِنْهُ كُلَّ مَعْلَقٍ [which may be<br>\
rendered She captivated him wholly] occurs in a<br>\
trad. as [virtually] meaning he loved her, and<br>\
was vehemently desirous of her. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  عَلِقَتْ<br>\
نَفْسُهُ الشَّىْءَ His soul, or mind, clung to the thing<br>\
persistently. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  ↓ قَدْ عَلِقَ الكِبَرُ مَعَالِقَهُ<br>\
[app. meaning Old age has taken hold in its holding places, or, agreeably with what is said in the<br>\
next sentence, has had its effects], in which معالق<br>\
is pl. of مَعْلَقٌ, is said to an old man. (TA.) And<br>\
of everything that has had its effect [so I here<br>\
render وَقَعَ مَوْقِعَهُ, but see art. وقع], one says, عَلِقَ<br>\
↓ مَعَالِقَهُ. (TA, and Ham p. 172.) ―<br>\
-b9-  عَلِقَتْ مَرَاسِيهَا<br>\
بِذِى رَمْرَامٍ [Their anchors have clung to a place<br>\
having the species of herbage called رمرام, meaning<br>\
they are abiding therein, (see مِرْسَاةٌ, in art. رسو,)]<br>\
is said of camels when they are at rest, or at ease,<br>\
and their eyes are refreshed by the pasturage; and<br>\
is a prov., applied to persons in the like condition<br>\
by reason of their means of subsistence. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b10-  عَلِقَ بِهِ, inf. n. عَلَقٌ, He contended with him<br>\
in an altercation [as though clinging to him];<br>\
disputed with him; or litigated with him. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b11-  لَا يَعْلَقُ بِكَ means لا يَلِيقُ بك [It will not be<br>\
suitable to thee; it will not befit thee]. (S and K<br>\
in art. ليق.) ―<br>\
-b12-  عَلِقَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا He set about,<br>\
began, or betook himself to, doing such a thing.<br>\
(S, O, K.) فَعَلِقُوا وَجْهَهُ ضَرْبًا occurs in a trad.,<br>\
meaning They set about, or betook themselves to,<br>\
smiting his face. (TA.) And a rájiz says,<br>\
عَلِقَ حَوْضِى نُغَرٌ مُكِبُّ<br>\
[Nughar (a species of birds) bending down their<br>\
heads] betook themselves to coming for the purpose<br>\
of drinking to my حوض [or watering-trough]:<br>\
or, as some say, liked it, and frequented it. (S,<br>\
O.) ―<br>\
-b13-  And مَا عَلِقْتُ أَقْولُهُ means I did not cease<br>\
saying it; like ما نَشِبْتُ. (A in art. نشب.) [Thus<br>\
عَلِقَ has two contr. meanings.] ―<br>\
-b14-  عَلِقَتِ الإِبِلُ<br>\
العِضَاهَ, (S, O, K,) aor.<br>\
عَلَقَ; (K;) and عَلَقَت likewise, aor.<br>\
عَلُقَ; (S, O, K;) inf. n. عَلْقٌ; (S, O, K; *)<br>\
The camels fed upon the upper, or uppermost, portions of the [trees called] عضاه, (S, O, K,) reaching<br>\
them with their mouths: (S and O in explanation<br>\
of the latter verb:) and يَعْلَقُ العِضَاهَ, said of a<br>\
camel, he plucks from the عضاه, [as though] hanging from it, by reason of his tallness: (S: in one<br>\
of my copies of the S, and in the TA, يَعْلُقُ:) or<br>\
one says, of camels, عَلَقَتْ مِنَ الشَّجَرِ, aor.<br>\
عَلُقَ,<br>\
inf. n. عَلْقٌ and عُلُوقٌ, meaning they ate of the<br>\
trees with their mouths: and عَلِقَتْ فِى الوَادِى,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَلَقَ, they pastured, or pastured where they<br>\
pleased, in the valley: (Msb:) accord. to Lh,<br>\
عَلَقَتْ, aor.<br>\
عَلُقَ, inf. n. عَلْقٌ, said of beasts, means<br>\
they ate the leaves of the trees: and accord. to<br>\
As, عَلَقَتْ, aor.<br>\
عَلُقَ, inf. n. عُلُوقٌ, means they<br>\
reached and took with their mouths. (TA.)<br>\
Hence, (TA,) it is said in a trad., أَرْوَاحُ الشُّهَدَآءِ<br>\
فِى حَوَاصِلِ طَيْرٍ خُضْرٍ تَعْلُقُ مِنْ وَرَقِ الجَنَّةِ, (S,<br>\
Msb, *) or مِنْ ثِمَارِ الجَنَّةِ, (TA,) and, as some<br>\
relate it, تَعْلَقُ, (Msb, TA,) [both as meaning<br>\
The souls of the martyrs are in the crops of green<br>\
birds that eat of the leaves, or fruits, of Paradise,]<br>\
but the former relation is that which should be<br>\
followed, because the latter requires that one<br>\
should say فِى ورق الجنّة [or فى ثمار الجنّة],<br>\
though the latter is said to be the more common.<br>\
(Msb.) One says also, عَلِقَتِ الإِبِلُ, aor.<br>\
عَلَقَ,<br>\
inf. n. عَلَقٌ, meaning The camels ate of the عُلْقَة<br>\
of the trees, i. e., of the trees that remain in the<br>\
winter and of which the camels are fed until they<br>\
attain to the رَبِيع [meaning spring, or springherbage]; as also ↓ تعلّقت. (TA.) And عَلَقَ,<br>\
inf. n. عَلَاقٌ and عُلُوقٌ, He ate. (TA.) And<br>\
الصَّبِىُّ يَعْلُقُ The child sucks his fingers. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b15-  عَلَقَهُ بِلِسَانِهِ [inf. n. عَلْقٌ] He blamed, or censured, him; he said to him that which he disliked,<br>\
or hated. (Lh, K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b16-  عَلِقَ أَمْرَهُ He knew<br>\
his affair. (K.) ―<br>\
-b17-  عَلِقَتِ المَرْأَةُ, (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
K,) inf. n. عُلُوقٌ, (Mgh,) or عَلَقٌ, (TA,) The<br>\
woman conceived, or became pregnant. (S, Mgh,<br>\
O, K.) Hence the saying, الغِرَاسُ تَبَدَّلُ بِالعُلُوقِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [The set, or shoot that is planted, becomes<br>\
changed by pullulating]; a metaphorical phrase;<br>\
meaning that what is planted becomes changed<br>\
because it increases and rises when it clings to the<br>\
earth and germinates. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b18-  عَلِقَتِ الدَّابَّةُ<br>\
The beast drank water and the leech (العَلَقَةُ) clave<br>\
to it: (S, O, K:) or, accord. to an explanation of<br>\
[the part. n.] مَعْلُوقٌ by Lth, one says عُلِقَت, of<br>\
the form of that whereof the agent is not named,<br>\
meaning it had leeches (عَلَق) that had taken hold<br>\
upon its fauces when it drank: (O:) or عُلِقَ,<br>\
also, like عُنِىَ, is used in this sense, (K, * TA,)<br>\
said of a man and of a beast. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b19-  عَالَقْتُ<br>\
فُلَانًا فَعَلَقْتُهُ: see 3.<br>\
2<br>\
علّقهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) i. e. الشَّىْءَ, (S, O,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. تَعْلِيقٌ; (S, O, K;) and ↓ اعلقهُ,<br>\
(S, * O, * Msb,) and ↓ تعلّقهُ; (S, O, K;) signify<br>\
the same. (S, O, Msb, K.) You say, علّق الشَّىْءَ<br>\
بِالشَّىْءِ, (Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. as above, He<br>\
hung, or suspended, the thing to the thing; and so<br>\
مِنَ الشَّىْءِ, and عَلَيْهِ: (TA:) [and] he made the<br>\
thing to cling, catch, cleave, adhere, hold, or stick<br>\
fast, to the thing; as also بِهِ ↓ اعلقهُ. (Msb.)<br>\
[For ex.,] one says, عَلَّقْتُ رِشَائِى بِرِشَائِكَ [I have<br>\
suspended my well-rope to thy well-rope]: and<br>\
رِشَآءَهُ بِرِشَآءِ البِئْرِ ↓ أَعْلَقَ [He suspended his well-rope<br>\
to the rope of the well]. (S, O.) [See also an<br>\
ex. of the latter verb in a verse cited voce رَافِضٌ.]<br>\
And علّقهُ عَلَى الوَتِدِ [He hung it on the peg]:<br>\
and in like manner, علّق الشَّىْءَ خَلْفَهُ [He hung<br>\
the thing behind him]; as, for instance, a حَقِيبَة,<br>\
&amp;c., behind the camel&#39;s saddle. (TA.) And<br>\
مَعَاذَةً ↓ تعلّق He hung (عَلَّقَ) upon himself an<br>\
amulet. (S, O.) And بِالغَرْبِ بَعِيرَيْنِ ↓ اعلق He<br>\
coupled two camels to the end of the well-rope [to<br>\
the other end of which was attached the large<br>\
bucket]. (IF, K.) [And in like manner they<br>\
say in the present day, علّق الخَيْلَ فِى العَرَبَةِ He<br>\
harnessed, or attached, the horses to the carriage.]<br>\
And أَظْفَارَهُ فِى الشَّىْءِ ↓ اعلق He made his nails to<br>\
cling, catch, or cleave, to the thing. (S, TA.)<br>\
And [in like manner,] علّق يَدَهُ and ↓ اعلقها [He<br>\
made his hands to cling, &amp;c.], followed by فى<br>\
before the object: both signify the same. (TA.)<br>\
And علّق الدَّابَّةَ, meaning علّق عَلَيْهَا [for علّق عليها<br>\
المِخْلَاةَ, agreeably with modern usage, i. e. He<br>\
hung upon the beast the nose-bag containing barley,<br>\
or the like; or he supplied the beast with عَلِيق,<br>\
which means barley, or the like, that is hung upon<br>\
the beast]. (TA.) [And hence, as is indicated<br>\
in the T and TA, علّق signifies, by a metaphor,<br>\
(tropical:)  He supplied with عَلِيق as meaning wine.] And<br>\
علّق رَاحِلَتَهُ He loosed the halter, or leading-rope,<br>\
from the muzzle of his riding-camel and threw it<br>\
[or hung it] upon her shoulders, to give her ease.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [The primary significations are those<br>\
mentioned in the second sentence of this paragraph: and hence several other significations<br>\
here following. ―<br>\
-b3-  علّقهُ بِكَذَا, and عَلَى كَذَا, He<br>\
made it to depend upon such a thing, as a condition.] You say, عَلَّقْتُ عِتْقَ عَبْدِى بِمَوْتِى [I<br>\
made the freedom of my slave to depend upon my<br>\
death]. (TA in art. دبر.) ―<br>\
-b4-  إِنْ أَنْطِقْ أُطَلَّقْ وَإِنْ<br>\
أَسْكُتْ أُعَلَّقْ, in the story of Umm-Zara, means<br>\
[If I speak, I am divorced; and if I be silent, I<br>\
am left in suspense, i. e.,] he leaves me like that<br>\
which is suspended, (O, TA,) neither retained<br>\
nor divorced. (TA.) [And similar to this is the<br>\
phrase تَعْلِيقُ أَفْعَالِ القُلُوبِ The suspending of the<br>\
verbs significant of operations of the mind from<br>\
government, as to the letter but not as to the meaning:] see مُعَلَّقٌ. ―<br>\
-b5-  [علّق البِنَآءَ He made the building, or structure, pensile, i. e. supported above the<br>\
ground, or above a stage or floor, by pillars or<br>\
piers or otherwise. Hence,] the saying نَقَبُوا<br>\
الحَائِطَ وَعَلَّقُوهُ means They dug beneath the wall<br>\
[or made a hole through it] and left it [or rendered it] مُعَلَّقًا [i. e. pensile, or supported above<br>\
the ground, being partially hollowed beneath].<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\

-b8-<br>\
And (TA) He closed, or made fast, a door, with<br>\
a kind of latch, or sliding bolt; syn. أَزْلَجَهُ, (O,<br>\
TA,) or أَرْتَجَهُ; (K;) as also ↓ اعلقهُ. (TA.)<br>\

pronoun denoting the object relates to a woman:<br>\
see 1, former half. ―<br>\
-b10-  عَلَّقَ فُلَانٌ دَمَ فُلَانٍ [app.<br>\
meaning Such a one attached to himself responsibility for the blood of such a one] is said when<br>\
the former is the slayer of the latter. (TA.<br>\
[Thus I find the phrase there written: but perhaps the right reading is عُلِّقَ.]) ―<br>\
-b11-  عَلَّقَهُ also signifies He joined him, and overtook him. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b12-  And He learned it, and took it or received it<br>\
[from another]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b13-  عَلِّقُوا رَمَقَهُ بِشَىْءٍ Give<br>\
ye to him something that shall stay, or arrest,<br>\
what remains in him of life. (Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b14-  عَلَّقْتُ<br>\
مَعَ فُلَانٍ عَلِيقَةً, (S, TA,) and مَعَ القَوْمِ, (TA,) I<br>\
sent with such a one, (S, TA,) and with the people,<br>\
or party, (TA,) a camel for the purpose of bringing corn for me upon it. (S, TA. [See عَلِيقَةٌ.])<br>\
اِرْضَ مِنَ المَرْكَبِ بِالتَّعْلِيقِ<br>\
is a prov., said to a man who is thereby enjoined<br>\
to be content with a part of that which he wants,<br>\
instead of the whole thereof; like him who rides<br>\
the camel termed عَلِيقَة one time after another<br>\
time: [so that it means Be thou content, instead<br>\
of the riding constantly, or instead of the beast<br>\
that is ridden only, with the sending a camel to<br>\
bring corn, upon which thou mayest ride occasionally:] (TA:) or the meaning may be, be thou<br>\
content, instead of thy riding, with the hanging of<br>\
thy goods upon the beast: or the meaning may<br>\
be, be thou content, in respect of the beast that is<br>\
ridden, with the hanging [thy goods] upon him in<br>\
thy turn. (Meyd.) ―<br>\
-b15-  And one says, عَلِّقْ لِنَاقَتِكِ,<br>\
meaning Go thou from thy she-camel (اِمْشِ عَنْهَا).<br>\
(O.)<br>\

عَاْلَقَ ↓ عَالَقْتُ فُلَانًا فَعَلَقْتُهُ I vied with such a one,<br>\
or contended with him for superiority, in precious<br>\
things (أَعْلَاق, pl. of عِلْق), and I surpassed him,<br>\
or was better than he, in respect of a precious<br>\
thing. (TA.) And عَالَقْتُهُ بِعِلْقِى وَعِلْقِهِ I laid a<br>\
bet, or wager, with him with precious articles of<br>\
property [or, I with my precious thing and he<br>\
with his precious thing]. (Ham p. 101, but without the vowel-signs.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَعْلَقَ see 2, former half, in six places: and again,<br>\
in the latter half. ―<br>\
-b2-  اعلق القَوْسَ He put a suspensory (عِلَاقَة) to the bow. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اعلق<br>\
said of one practising the capturing of game, or<br>\
animals of the chase, He had the game, or<br>\
animal of the chase, caught, or stuck fast, in his<br>\
snare. (S, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  اعلق also signifies He sent,<br>\
or let go, [or applied,] leeches (عَلَق), (S, O, K,)<br>\
upon a place, (S, O, TA,) to such (S, O, K) the<br>\

-A3-  And He found, lighted on,<br>\
or met with, a precious article, (عِلْقًا, K, TA, [in<br>\
the CK عَلْقًا] i. e. نَفِيسًا, TA,) of property: (K,<br>\
TA:) mentioned by Ibn-&#39;Abbád. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  And<br>\
He brought to pass that which was a calamity.<br>\
(K.) You say to a man, أَعْلَقْتَ وَأَفْلَقْتَ, i. e.<br>\
جِئْتَ بِعُلَقَ فُلَقَ, meaning [Thou hast brought to<br>\
pass] that which is a calamity. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
أَعْلَقْتُ عَنْهُ I removed from him العَلُوق, meaning<br>\
that which was a calamity. (O, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence,<br>\
الإِعْلَاقُ as meaning A woman&#39;s pressing with the<br>\
finger the نَغَانِغ, which are certain portions of<br>\
flesh by the uvula, of a child, thereby endeavouring to cure his عُذْرَة, (O, TA, *) which means a<br>\
pain and swelling in the fauces; (TA;) i. q. الدَّغْرُ.<br>\
(S, TA. [See 1 in art. دغر.]) You say of a<br>\
woman, أَعْلَقَتْ وَلَدَهَامِنَ العُذْرَة, (S,) or أَعْلَقَتْ<br>\

thrust]) her child&#39;s [swelling termed] عُذْرَة with<br>\
her hand: (S:) or she pressed that part with her<br>\
finger, and thrust it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And hence,<br>\
(TA,) one says also, أَعْلَقْتُ عَلَىَّ, meaning I put<br>\
my hand into my fauces to constrain myself to<br>\
vomit. (O, TA.)<br>\

cut an opening for the head to be put through it,<br>\

for service and work; (TA;) and it extends to<br>\
the place of the waist-band: (K, TA: [see also<br>\
إِتْبٌ:]) or a garment held in high estimation;<br>\

-A3-  إِبِل<br>\
لَيْسَ بِهَا علِقَةٌ is a phrase mentioned by Ibn-&#39;Abbád,<br>\
(O, TA,) as meaning [app.] اصرة. (TA. [This<br>\
word, in the TA, is blurred: and in the O, the<br>\
place that it occupied has perished: I think that<br>\
it is most probably أَصِرَّةٌ, pl. of صِرَارٌ; and therefore that the phrase means Camels not having<br>\
upon them strings, or pieces of rag, bound upon<br>\
their udders or teats, to prevent their young ones<br>\
from sucking: for one says صَرَّ بِالنَّاقَةِ as well as<br>\
صَرَّ النَّاقَةَ; and in like manner, I suppose, one<br>\
may say لَيْسَ بِهَا أَصِرَّةٌ: and hence, perhaps, it<br>\
may mean not having milk: see the phrase مَا<br>\
بِالنَّاقَةِ عَلُوقٌ.])<br>\
-A4-  [For the phrase اِسْتَأْصَلَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
عِلْقَاتَهُِمْ, see the next paragraph but one.]<br>\
عَلْقَى, (S, O, K,) like سَكْرَى, (K,) A certain<br>\
plant: (S, O, K:) accord. to Sb, (S, O,) it is<br>\
used as sing. and pl.; (S, O, K;) and its alif<br>\
[written ى] is to denote the fem. gender, therefore it is without tenween: but others say that its<br>\
alif is to render it quasi-coordinate [to the quadriliteral-radical class], and is with tenween, the<br>\
n. un. being عَلْقَاةٌ: (S, O:) IJ says that the alif<br>\
in عَلْقَاةٌ is not to denote the fem. gender, because<br>\
it is followed by ة; but when they elide the ة,<br>\
they say عَلْقَى, without tenween: (L, TA: [in<br>\
both of which, more is added, but with some<br>\
mistranscription or omission rendering it inconsistent:]) its twigs are slender, difficult to be<br>\
broken, and brooms are made of it: (K: [but<br>\
this is taken from what here follows:]) Aboo-Nasr says, the علقى is a tree [or plant] of which<br>\
the greenness continues during the hot season, and<br>\
its places of growth are the sands, and the plain,<br>\
or soft, tracts: and he says, an Arab of the desert<br>\
showed me a plant which he asserted to be the<br>\
علقى; having long and slender twigs, and delicate<br>\
leaves; called in Pers. خُلْوَام [?]; those who<br>\
collect [the dung used for fuel called] جَلَّة make of<br>\
it brooms for that purpose: to which he adds,<br>\
and it is said, on the authority of the early Arabs,<br>\
that the علقاة is a certain tree [or plant] which is<br>\
found in the sands, green, having leaves, but in<br>\
which is no good: (O:) [it is said, however,<br>\
that] the decoction thereof is drunk for the dropsy.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
عِلْقَاتَهُمْ, (O, K,) like سِعْلَاتَهُمْ, (O,) in the saying اِسْتَأْصَلَ اللّٰهُ عِلْقضاتَهُمْ, (O, K, * [in the CK<br>\
عَلْقاتَهُمْ,]) is a dial. var. of عِرْقَاتَهُمْ, (K, [in the<br>\
CK عَرْقاتَهُمْ,]) [and] is said by Ibn-&#39;Abbád to<br>\
mean أَصْلَهُمْ [i. e. May God utterly destroy their<br>\
race, stock, or family]: but some say that it is a<br>\
pl. of العِلْقُ signifying “ that which is precious,<br>\
or held in high estimation: ” and in one dial. it<br>\
is [عِلْقَاتِهِمْ,] with kesr to the ت. (O.)<br>\
عَلِقْنَةٌ: see عَلَاقِيَةٌ.<br>\
عَلَاقٌ: see عُلْقَةٌ, in eight places.<br>\
عَلَاقِ [an imperative verbal noun], like نَزَالِ<br>\
&amp;c., (IDrd, O, K, *) means تَعَلَّقْ, (K,) or تَعَلَّقْ<br>\
بِهِ [i. e. Cling thou, cleave thou, or stick thou fast,<br>\
to him, or it]. (IDrd, O.)<br>\
عِلَاقٌ A thing that is hung, or suspended, like<br>\
the عُوذَة [or amulet]. (TA voce مَعْذُورٌ as an<br>\
epithet applied to a child affected with the pain,<br>\
of the fauces, termed عُذْرَة.)<br>\
عَلُوقٌ A thing that clings, cleaves, or sticks fast,<br>\
(يَعْلَقُ, [in the CK تَعَلَّقَ,]) to a man. (S, O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,] Death, or the decree of death;<br>\
syn. مَنِيَّةٌ; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ عَلَّاقَةٌ, (S, TA,)<br>\
accord. to the K, erroneously, عَلَاقَة [without<br>\
teshdeed]: in a verse in which it occurs, some<br>\
explain العَلَّاقَةُ as meaning thus; and some, as<br>\
meaning the serpent, because of its clinging.<br>\
(TA.) El-Mufaddal En-Nukree says,<br>\
وَقَدْ عَلِقَتْ بِثَعْلَبَةَ العَلُوقُ<br>\
[When death, or the decree of death, had clung to<br>\
Thaalebeh]. (S, O.) The pl. of عَلُوقٌ, in this<br>\
sense, and in the sense next following, as mentioned before, in the paragraph commencing with<br>\
the word عُلَقَ, is عُلُقٌ, with two dammehs. (TA.<br>\
See that paragraph.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence, likewise,]<br>\
A calamity, or misfortune. (O, K.) It occurs in<br>\
a trad. in this sense, applied to what is termed<br>\
عُذْرَة, or to the operation performed upon it. (O,<br>\
TA. [See 4.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also عَوْلَقٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also Pasture<br>\
upon which camels feed. (S, O, K.) And Trees<br>\
that are eaten by the camels that have been ten<br>\
months pregnant, (O, K,) in consequence of which<br>\
they assume a red hue. (O.) El-Aashà speaks of<br>\
it [in a verse of which I find four different read-<br>\
ings] as occasioning a redness in she-camels: but<br>\
some say that he means thereby The young in the<br>\
bellies; and by the redness, the beauty of their<br>\
colour on the occasion of conceiving. (S, O.)<br>\
And some say that, as used by El-Aashà, it<br>\
means The sperma of the stallion; a signification<br>\
mentioned by AHeyth; because the she-camels<br>\
become altered in colours, and red, when they<br>\
conceive. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَا بِالنَّاقَةِ عَلُوقٌ means There<br>\
is not in the she-camel aught of milk. (S. [And<br>\
عَلَاقٌ signifies the same: see an ex. voce عُلْقَةٌ.])<br>\
-A3-  Also A she-camel that is made to incline<br>\
(تُعْطَفُ [in the CK تَعْطَفُ]) to a young one not<br>\
her own, and will not keep to it, but only smells it<br>\
with her nose, and refuses to yield her milk; (S,<br>\
O, K; [see an ex. in a verse cited in the first<br>\
paragraph of art. رأم;]) as also ↓ مُعَالِقٌ: (S:) or<br>\
a she-camel that inclines to her young one, and<br>\
feels it, until it becomes familiar with her, but<br>\
when it desires to suck the milk from her, strikes<br>\
it, and drives it away. (Ham p. 206.) [Hence,]<br>\
one says of him who speaks a speech with which<br>\
is no deed, عَامَلَنَا مُعَامَلَةَ العَلُوقِ [He dealt with<br>\
us with the dealing of the علوق]. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And A she-camel that does not become familiar<br>\
with the stallion nor affect the young one: (Lth,<br>\
O, K:) as implying a presage of good [i. e. that<br>\
she will cling to both]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A woman<br>\
that does not love other than her husband: (Lth,<br>\
O, K:) likewise as implying a presage of good.<br>\

-b4-  And A woman that suckles the child of<br>\
another. (Lth, O, K.) ―<br>\

عُلُوقٌ [originally an inf. n.]: see عُلْقَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  One<br>\
says also, لِى فِى الأَمْرِ عُلُوقٌ There is something<br>\
made obligatory to me, or in my favour, in the<br>\
affair, or case; and so ↓ مُتَعَلَّقٌ. (TA.)<br>\
عَلِيقٌ i. q. قَضِيمٌ, (S, MA, K, TA,) i. e. Barley<br>\

sense and also as meaning provender of beans and<br>\
the like, the former word is now used, properly,<br>\
or originally,] that is hung upon the beast [in a<br>\

relating to things extrinsic to the mind; as a<br>\
bow, and a whip: (Kull p. 262:) see عَلَقٌ, last<br>\

of love]: (S, O:) Lh mentions, on the authority<br>\
of Ks, and as known to As, the saying لَهَا فِى<br>\
قَلْبِى عَلَاقَةُ حُبٍّ [i. e. There is to her, in my heart,<br>\
an attachment, or a tie, or a clinging, of love];<br>\
and likewise, on the authority of the former, but<br>\
as unknown to As, حُبٍّ ↓ عِلْقُ and حُبٍّ ↓ عِلَاقَةُ,<br>\
though As knew the phrase حُبٍّ ↓ عَلَقُ: (TA:)<br>\

(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A contention in an altercation;<br>\

between them two anything upon which either of<br>\
them has a hold against the other: and the pl. is<br>\

[or rather هٰذِهِ الدار,] with fet-h, i. e. [There<br>\
belongs to such a one, in this house, something<br>\

amount, of the dowry, or nuptial gift,] upon<br>\
which they have a hold against him who takes<br>\
a woman in marriage: (Sh, K, TA:) pl. عَلَائِقُ<br>\
[as above]: (K, TA:) whence the saying, in a<br>\
trad., أَدُّوا العَلَائِقَ i. e., as expl. by the Prophet,<br>\
[Pay ye] what their families have agreed upon;<br>\

[the pl.] عَلَائِقُ likewise signifies [Obligations of<br>\

is also expl. by Lh as meaning Articles of merchandise. (TA.) ―<br>\

to signify النَبْلُ [evidently, I think, a mistranscription for التَّبْلُ, i. e. Blood-revenge; or the<br>\
seeking for blood-revenge, or the like; though it<br>\
seems to be better rendered the obligation of bloodrevenge; or the obligation of a bloodwit, attaching<br>\

above]: and by Aboo-Nasr to signify التَّبَاعُدُ<br>\
[which I think to be a mistranscription for التَّنَافُدُ,<br>\
signifying contention, disputation, or litigation, a<br>\
meaning mentioned in the former half of this<br>\
paragraph]: and both of these significations are<br>\
assigned to it in the saying of Imra-el-Keys,<br>\

both of these appellations signify a thorny tree<br>\

مَعْلَقٌ, and its pl. (مَعَالِقُ): see 1, in four places.<br>\
مِعْلَقٌ A small عُلْبَة [or milking-vessel]: (S, O,<br>\
TA:) next is the جَنْبَة, larger than it: then, the<br>\

of these, and is a drinking-cup, or bowl, which the<br>\

-b2-  Hence, المُعَلَّقَاتُ السَّبْعُ or السَّبْعُ<br>\
المُعَلَّقَاتُ The seven suspended odes; accord. to<br>\
several writers: two reasons for their being thus<br>\
called are mentioned in the Mz (49th نوع); one,<br>\
that “ they were selected from all the poetry, and<br>\
written upon قَبَاطِىّ (pieces of fine white cloth of<br>\
Egypt) with water-gold, and suspended upon the<br>\
Kaabeh; ” the other, that “ when an ode was<br>\
deemed excellent, the King used to say, &#39; Suspend<br>\
ye for us this, &#39; that it might be in his repository: ”<br>\
that these odes were selected from all the poetry,<br>\
and that any copies of them were suspended collectively upon the Kaabeh, has been sufficiently<br>\
confuted in Nöldeke&#39;s “ Beiträge zur Kenntniss<br>\
der Poesie der alten Araber,” pp. xvii. — xxiii.:<br>\
it is not so unreasonable to suppose that they may<br>\
have been suspended upon the Kaabeh singly,<br>\
at different times, by their own authors or by<br>\
admiring friends, and suffered to remain thus<br>\
placarded for some days, perhaps during the<br>\
period when the city was most thronged by pilgrims; but the latter of the two assertions in the<br>\
Mz seems to be more probable. ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence also<br>\

anything by means of which a thing is suspended<br>\
(S, O, K) is called its مِعْلَاق, (S, O,) or is called<br>\

suspended: (TA:) pl. of the first [and of the<br>\
second] مَعَالِيقُ. (Mgh, Msb.) Also A stirrupleather: pl. as above. (MA.) And المِعْلَاقَانِ<br>\
signifies مِعْلَاقَا الدَّلْوِ وَشِبْهِهَا [app. meaning The<br>\
