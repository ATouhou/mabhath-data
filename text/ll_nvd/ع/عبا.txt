عَبَأَ, aor.<br>\
عَبَاَ, inf. n. عَبْءٌ, He packed up<br>\
goods, or utensils; put them one upon another:<br>\
(TA:) you say, عَبَأْتُ الشَّىْءَ فِى الوِعَآءِ [I packed<br>\
the thing in the repository], aor. as above: and<br>\
some allow also عَبَّيْتُ with teshdeed and ى<br>\
[which is commonly used in the present day]:<br>\
(Msb:) [and عَبَوْتُ also, inf. n. عَبْوٌ:] or عَبَأَ, (S,<br>\
O, K,) aor. as above, (K,) and so the inf. n.;<br>\
(S, O;) and ↓ عبّأ, inf. n. تَعْبِئَةٌ and تَعْبِىْءٌ; (S,<br>\
O, K;) he prepared, set in order, disposed, or<br>\
arranged, goods, or utensils: (S, O, K:) and<br>\
each, (K,) or the former, (Msb,) or the latter,<br>\
(S, O,) and عبّى, with teshdeed and ى, (Msb,)<br>\
[agreeably with the authority of Yoo, for] Yoo<br>\
used to say تَعْبِيَةُ الجَيْشِ, without ء, (S, O,) he<br>\
fitted out with the requisite equipage &amp;c., (K,) or<br>\
prepared, (O,) or set in order, disposed, or<br>\
arranged, (O, Msb,) or set in order, disposed, or<br>\
arranged, in their places, and prepared for war<br>\
or fight, (TA,) the horsemen, (S, O,) or the<br>\
army. (Msb, K, TA.) And عَبَأْتُ لَهُ شَرًّا I prepared for him evil, or mischief. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَبَأَ,<br>\
(AZ, S, O, K,) aor. as above, (TA,) and so<br>\
the inf. n., (AZ, S, O,) also signifies He made,<br>\
(K,) or prepared and made, (AZ, S, O,) and<br>\
mixed, perfume; (AZ, S, O, K;) and so ↓ عبّأ,<br>\
inf. n. تَعْبِئَةٌ and تَعْبِىْءٌ; and عبّى. (TA.) [And<br>\
accord. to an explanation of the inf. n. in the<br>\
KL, it seems that عَبَأَ signifies He excited a good,<br>\
or pleasant, odour; as rendered by Golius: but<br>\
this I think doubtful.] ―<br>\
-b3-  مَا أَعْبَأُ بِهِ means What<br>\
shall I do with it? (T, K, TA,) namely, the<br>\
affair. (T, TA.) مَا يَعْبَأُ بِكُمْ رَبِّى, in the Kur<br>\
[xxv. last verse], is said by Mujáhid to mean<br>\
What will my Lord do with you? but see another<br>\
explanation of this in what follows. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And it signifies also I do not care for, mind,<br>\
heed, or regard, him: (S, O, Msb, K:) or I do<br>\
not receive with approbation anything from him,<br>\
nor anything of his discourse: (Aboo-&#39;Adnán,<br>\
TA:) or, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák [i. e. Zj], I do<br>\
not hold him to be of any weight or worth; do not<br>\
esteem him: and he says that مَا يَعْبَأُ بِكُمْ رَبِّى, of<br>\
which an explanation has been given above,<br>\
means What weight have ye in the estimation of<br>\
my Lord? (TA.) One says also, مَا عَبَأْتُ بِهِ<br>\
شَيْئًا, meaning I did not reckon him as anything;<br>\
or did not esteem him at all. (Aboo-&#39;Abd-Er-Rahmán, TA.) And مَا عَبَأْتُ لَهُ شَيْئًا I did not<br>\
care for, mind, heed, or regard, him: (T, TA:)<br>\
or so مَا عَبَأْتُ بِهِ. (Msb.) And قَدْ عَبَأَ اللّٰهُ عَنْهُ<br>\
God has received with approbation everything<br>\
from him. (Aboo-&#39;Adnán, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And عَبَأَ لَهُ<br>\
He thought it, or opined it, and held it, or took<br>\
to it as a tenet. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَبَأَ وَجْهُهُ, aor.<br>\
عَبَاَ,<br>\
His face shone: (IAar, TA:) and so عَبَا, aor.<br>\

alone, as indicated in the S and K, meaning She<br>\
stuffed her vulva with the مِعْبَأَة, q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And [اعتبأ app. signifies He put together for himself; or grasped; or got, or gained, possession of;<br>\
property,] one says, اِحْتَوَيْتُ مَا عِنْدَهُ وَامْتَخَرْتُهُ<br>\
وَاعْتَبَأْتُهُ وَازْدَلَعْتُهُ. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA.)<br>\
عَبْءٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  Also The<br>\
light of the sun: (IAar, O, K:) and so عَبٌ,<br>\
(IAar, O, K, &amp;c.,) of the former of which IAar<br>\
says that it is not known whether it be a dial.<br>\
var. of the latter or the original thereof; and he<br>\
says also that عَبْوَةٌ signifies the same; (TA;) or<br>\
so عَبْوٌ; (TA in art. عبو;) the pl. of which is<br>\
عِبًى: (TA in that art. and in the present also:)<br>\
so too does عَبٌّ, (K in art. عب,) accord. to some.<br>\
(TA in that art.)<br>\
عِبْءٌ A load, or burden, (S, O, Msb, * K, TA,)<br>\
of goods, or merchandise, &amp;c.; (TA;) or such as<br>\
a debt, or some other reponsibility that one takes<br>\
upon himself: (Lth, TA:) a weight, (Msb, K,)<br>\
of debt, &amp;c., (Msb.) or of anything: (K:) pl.<br>\
أَعْبَآءٌ. (S, O, Msb.) One says, حَمَلْتُ أَعْبَآءَ القَوْمِ<br>\
i. e. [I bore] the weights, or burdens, of debt, &amp;c.,<br>\
of the people, or party. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A half-load; or burden borne on one side of a beast,<br>\
equiponderant to another on the other side; syn.<br>\
عِدْلٌ; (S, O, K;) of goods [&amp;c.]: each of what<br>\
are termed عِبْآنِ: pl. as above. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
[hence] A like; as also ↓ عَبْءٌ: (S, O, K:) pl.<br>\
as above. (TA.) One says, هٰذَا عَبْءُ هٰذَا This<br>\
is the like of this. (TA.)<br>\
عَبَآءٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  Also, (K,<br>\
TA,) applied to a man, (TA,) Stupid, dull, or<br>\
heavy: (K, TA:) like عَبَامٌ. (TA.) [But see<br>\

(Msb,) or the ء is a substitute for ى, (TA,) and<br>\
↓ عَبَآءٌ, (K,) or this is a pl., like عَبَاآتٌ, (Msb,)<br>\

representation of the عباية now most commonly<br>\
worn in Egypt and Arabia and Syria, see my<br>\
