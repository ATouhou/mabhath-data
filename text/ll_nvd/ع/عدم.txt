means مَا يَعْدُونِى [i. e. This thing, or affair,<br>\
does not pass from me]. (S, K, TA. [In the<br>\

اعدمهُ is syn. with أَفْقَدَهُ [meaning He made<br>\
him to lack, want, or lose, it, or him]: (AHát,<br>\
Msb:) and has a second objective complement:<br>\
one says, لَا أَعْدَمَنِى اللّٰهُ فَضْلَهُ [May God not<br>\
make me to lack, want, or lose, his bounty]:<br>\
(Msb:) or لَا أَعْدَمَنِى فَضْلَكَ May He (i. e. God)<br>\
not make thy bounty to depart from me: and<br>\
اعدمنى اللّٰهُ فُلَانًا [God made me to lack, want,<br>\
or lose, such a one]. (TA.) ―<br>\

him, or refused him, (Az, MA, K, TA,) what he<br>\

TA: [in the S, this meaning seems to be indicated by the context; but in the K, the context<br>\

expl. in this paragraph:]) in this sense, said of<br>\
God. (S, K, TA) ―<br>\
-b4-  أَعْدَمَنِى الشَّىْءُ means [app.<br>\
The thing excited my want, or made me to want<br>\

-b5-  [And<br>\
اعدمهُ signifies also He made it to have no existence; to be non-existent; or he annihilated it;<br>\
or did away with it; agreeably with explanations<br>\
of the inf. n. (إِعْدَامٌ) in the KL and PS &amp;c.,<br>\

إِعْسَارٌ and عُسْرٌ as of أَعْسَرَ, and إِفْحَاشٌ and فُحْشٌ<br>\
as of أَفْحَشَ, or rather the latter in every one of<br>\
these instances is a simple subst., as ISd says,<br>\
(TA,) signifies He (a man, S) was, or became,<br>\
poor, needy, or destitute; (Kr, S, Msb, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ عَدِمَ. (TA.)<br>\
7<br>\

a thing, and of a quality, or faculty, &amp;c.;] and<br>\
by predominance of application, lack, &amp;c., of<br>\
property or wealth; (K, TA;) and departure<br>\
thereof; and paucity thereof; (TA;) or poverty,<br>\
neediness, or destitution. (S in explanation of the<br>\

↓ مُعْدِمٌ, (S,) and ↓ مَعْدُومٌ, (Msb, TA,) which<br>\
last occurs in a trad. as meaning the poor who<br>\
has become, by reason of the pressure of his want,<br>\
as though himself were not existing, or lost: عَدِيمٌ<br>\
signifies having no property; as also ↓ مُعْدِمٌ:<br>\
and having nothing: it is of the measure فَعِيلٌ in<br>\
the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ: and its pl. is<br>\
عُدَمَآءُ; erroneously said in the K to be pl. of<br>\
عَدِمٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\

destitute of intellect, or understanding. (TA.)<br>\
And Insane; demented. (IAar, Az, K, * TA.)<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  يَكْسِبُ المَعْدُومَ means He is fortunate, or<br>\
possessed of good fortune; [properly,] he attains<br>\
what others are denied. (K.) It is said in a<br>\
trad., إِنَّكَ لَتَكْسِبُ المَعْدُومَ وَتُطْعِمُ المَأْدُومَ. (M<br>\
and TA in art. ادم: expl. voce أَدِيمٌ.) ―<br>\
