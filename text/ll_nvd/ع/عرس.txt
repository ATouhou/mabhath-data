went in to his wife (IAth, Msb) [a signification<br>\
which may be meant to be included in the explanation بني بها or بنى عليها] on the occasion of that<br>\

TA.)<br>\

TA,) then the beam is laid from the inner extremity of that wall to the further end of the<br>\
chamber, (TA,) and it is roofed over, (S, O, K,<br>\
TA,) i. e. the whole chamber is roofed over: what<br>\
is between the two walls [above mentioned] is<br>\
[called] a سَهْوَة [q. v.], and what is beneath the<br>\
beam [app. with what is screened by the middle<br>\
wall from the portion (of the chamber) in which<br>\

this is the real thing intended by الإِعْرَاس: (TA:)<br>\

or, accord. to some, fem. only: as masc., its pl. is<br>\
أَعْرَاسٌ; and as fem., its pl. is عُرُسَاتٌ. (Msb.)<br>\

marriage-feast, or a feast given on the occasion of<br>\
the conducting of a bride to her husband, let him<br>\

feast made on the occasion of conducting a bride<br>\
to her husband: (Msb:) in this sense it is masc.:<br>\

hold it to be fem. only,] for [accord, to them] it<br>\
should have ة, being a fem. n. of three letters.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عِرْسٌ A man&#39;s wife: (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K:)<br>\
and a woman&#39;s husband: (O, Msb, K:) pl. (in<br>\
both senses, TA) أَعْرَاسٌ: (S, O, Msb, K, TA:)<br>\

cleft (أَشْتَرُ), and very short ears, as though they<br>\
were amputated, (Lth, O, K,) and having a<br>\
canine tooth; (TA;) called in Persian رَاسُوْ: (S,<br>\
Mgh:) the name is determinate and indeterminate: (TA:) pl. بَنَاتُ عِرْسٍ, (S, Msb, K,) applied to the males and the females; (O, K;)<br>\

عَرُوسٌ A bridegroom: and a bride: i. e., a<br>\
man, and a woman, during the period of their<br>\
إِعْرَاس or أَعْرَاس [thus differently written in different MSS.]; (S, A, O, Msb, K;) or when the<br>\
one goes in to the other: (IAth:) you say رَجُلٌ<br>\
عَرُوسٌ [a bridegroom, vulgarly, in the present<br>\
day, ↓ عَرِيس,] and اِمْرَأَةٌ عَرُوسٌ [a bride, vulgarly,<br>\
in the present day, ↓ عَرُوسَة]: (S:) and عُرُوسٌ is<br>\
a dial. var. of the same: (IAar, TA:) pl. mase.<br>\

because of the fourth letter. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
