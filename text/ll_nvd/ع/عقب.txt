often meaning near after him;] (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K, TA;) followed him; succeeded him; (S,<br>\
Mgh, K, TA;) came in, or took, his place; as<br>\

and ↓ عاقبهُ; (S, Msb, K;) and ↓ اعتقبهُ; (TA;)<br>\
meaning it came after; (S, * Msb, K, * TA;)<br>\
&amp;c., as above: (TA:) and ↓ تعقّبهُ is used in this<br>\
sense, but not rightly. (Mgh.) [All primarily<br>\
denote proximate sequence.] You say, عَقَبُونَا and<br>\
عَقَبُوا مِنْ خَلْفِنَا They came after us. (TA.) And<br>\
عَقَبُونَا مِنْ خَلْفِنَا and ↓ عَقَّبُونَا They succeeded us,<br>\

فُلَانٌ مَكَانَ أَبِيهِ, (S, O, TA,) aor.<br>\
عَقُبَ, inf. n. عَقْبٌ,<br>\
(TA,) and quasi-inf. n. ↓ عَاقِبَةٌ, this being a subst.<br>\
used in the sense of an inf. n., like as كَاذِبَةٌ is<br>\
[said to be] in the Kur lvi. 2, (S, O,) or it is an<br>\
inf. n. syn. with عَقْبٌ, (Msb in art. عفو,) Such a<br>\
one succeeded, or took the place of, his father; (S,<br>\
O, TA;) as also ↓ عقّب. (TA.) [Hence also<br>\
several phrases here following.] ―<br>\
-b3-  It is said in a<br>\
trad., كُلُّ غَازِيَةٍ غَزَتْ يَعْقُبُ بَعْضُهَا بَعْضًا i. e.<br>\
[Every party that goes forth on a warring, or<br>\
warring and plundering, expedition] shall take its<br>\
turn, one after another:] when one company has<br>\
gone forth and returned, it shall not be constrained to go forth again until another has taken<br>\

-b4-  عَقَبْتُ الرَّجُلَ فِى أَهْلِهِ<br>\
means بَغَيْتُهُ بِشَرٍّ وَخَلَفْتُهُ [i. e. I sought to do evil<br>\
to the man, and took his place (see art. خلف),<br>\
with respect to his wife; i. e. I committed adultery<br>\
with his wife]: (S, O:) or عَقَبَهُ signifies [simply]<br>\
بِغَاهُ بِشَرٍّ [he sought to do evil to him]: (K: [in<br>\
which وَخَلَفَهُ seems to have been inadvertently<br>\
omitted: but SM immediately adds what here<br>\
follows:]) and one says also, عَقَبَ فِى إِثْرِ الرَّجُلِ<br>\
بِمَا يُكْرَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَقُبَ, inf. n. عَقْبٌ, meaning He accused the man [app. behind his back] of a thing<br>\

من مالك,]) Whatever evil consequence happen<br>\
to me, with respect to it, (referring to merchandise,) the responsibility for it will be on thee [and<br>\
compensation shall be made from thy property]:<br>\
and [تَعْقِبَةٌ (thus in the O) appears, from what<br>\
follows, to be an inf. n. of the latter verb in this<br>\
sense; or it may perhaps be from the former<br>\
verb, like تَهْلِكَةٌ from هَلَكَ; for] one says, بَاعَنِى<br>\
سِلْعَةً وَعَلَيْهِ تَعْقِبَةٌ إِنْ كَانَت فِيهَا [He sold me an<br>\
article of merchandise, and was responsible for an<br>\
evil consequence, (or for damage afterwards found<br>\
in it,) should there be any in it]. (ISh, O, TA. *)<br>\
―<br>\
-b10-  عَقَبَهُ and ↓ عقّبهُ and ↓ اعقبهُ signify also He<br>\
took, or received, from him something in exchange,<br>\
an exchange, a substitute, or an equivalent, for<br>\
another thing: it is said in a trad., إِنْ لَمْ يَقْرُوهُ<br>\
فَلَهُ أَنْ يَعْقُبَهُمْ بِمِثْلِ قِرَاهُ If they entertain him not.<br>\
he shall have a right to take from them as a substitute the like of his entertainment which they<br>\
denied him: and one says also مِنْهُ خَيْرًا ↓ استعقب,<br>\

good, or evil: (TA:) and عَقَبَ الرَّجُلَ, aor.<br>\
عَقُبَ,<br>\

he (the latter) had taken from him. (O, * TA.)<br>\
After the words in the Kur lx. 11, وَإِنْ فَاتَكُمْ شَىْءٌ<br>\
مِنْ أَزْوَاجِكُمْ إِلَى الْكُفَّارِ, there are three different<br>\
readings, ↓ فَعَاقَبْتُمْ, and ↓ فَعَقَّبْتُمْ, and فَعَقَبْتُمْ:<br>\
(TA:) the first means and ye take, or carry off,<br>\
spoil: (Masrook Ibn-El-Ajda&#39;, S, TA:) or the<br>\
second has this meaning; and the first means<br>\
and ye punish them so that ye take, or carry off,<br>\
spoil: and the third means and ye have a requital:<br>\
the second is the best; and the third is also good;<br>\
but the second has a more intensive meaning:<br>\
(Aboo-Is-hák the Grammarian, L, TA:) accord.<br>\
to Fr, the first and second signify the same: (L,<br>\
TA:) and As says that عَقْبٌ [inf. n. of عَقَبَ] is<br>\
syn. with عِقَابٌ [inf. n. of عَاقَبَ; but whether<br>\
with reference to this case, I do not find]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b11-  And عَقَبَ, aor.<br>\
عَقُبَ, inf. n. عَقْبٌ, also signifies<br>\
He sought, or sought after, wealth, or some other<br>\
thing. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَقَبَ, (S, O, K,) aor.<br>\
عَقِبَ and<br>\
عَقُبَ,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. عَقْبٌ, (S, O,) He bound a thing<br>\
with [the kind of sinew, or tendon, called] عَقَب;<br>\
as also ↓ عقّب [inf. n. تَعْقِيبٌ, of which see an ex.<br>\
in a verse cited voce مَصْنَعٌ]: he bound therewith<br>\
a خَوْق. i. e. the ring of an ear-drop, fearing lest<br>\
it should incline on one side: or he bound an earring with a thread called عُقَاب: (TA:) and he<br>\
wound round a bow, (S, O, K,) and an arrow,<br>\
(S, O,) with [the kind of sinew, or tendon, called]<br>\
عَقَب, (O,) or with somewhat thereof: (S, K:)<br>\
or عَقَبَهُ بِالعَقَبِ he bound it, namely, the [arrow<br>\
termed] قِدْح, with the عَقَب, in consequence of its<br>\
having broken. (IB, L, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  عَقَبْنَا الرَّكِيَّةَ<br>\

عَقِبٌ,)] We lined the well with stones behind [the<br>\
other] stones. (TA. [See also 4.])<br>\
-A4-  [The inf. n.]<br>\
العَقْبُ also signifies الرَّجْعُ, [which generally<br>\
means The making, or causing, to return, or go<br>\
back; but this may perhaps be a mistake for<br>\
الرُّجُوعُ, for it is immediately added,] Dhu-rRummeh says,<br>\
كَأَنَّ صِيَاحَ الكُدْرِ يَنْظُرْنَ عَقْبَنَا<br>\
تَرَاطُنُ أَنْبَساطٍ عَلَيْهِ طَغَامِ<br>\
meaning [As though the crying of the dusky she-camels] looking, or waiting, for our returning<br>\
from watering that they might go to the water<br>\
after us [were the barbarous talk of low, or ignoble, Nabathæans, over it, i. e. over the water].<br>\

عَقَبَ,] inf. n. عَقَبٌ, The<br>\
branches of the plant, or herbage, became slender,<br>\
and the leaves thereof turned yellow. (IAar, TA.<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  The inf. n., تَعْقِيبٌ, signifies also The doing a<br>\
thing and then returning to doing it: (IAth, TA:)<br>\

and then returning to doing it in the same day:<br>\
(Sh, TA:) and [particularly] the making a warring, or warring and plundering, expedition, and<br>\
then another in the same year. (S, O, K.) [See<br>\
also مُعَقِّبٌ.] You say, عقّب بِصَلَاةٍ بَعْدَ صَلَاةٍ, and<br>\
بِغَزَاةٍ بَعْدَ غَزَاةٍ, He followed up one prayer with<br>\
another, and one warring, or warring and plundering, expedition with another. (TA.) And<br>\
صَلَّى مِنَ اللَّيْلِ ثُمَّ عَقَّبَ He prayed in the night<br>\
and then repeated the prayer. (IAar, TA.) And<br>\
عُقِّبَ الغَازِيَةُ بِأَمْثَالِهَا, and ↓ أُعْقِبَ, The warring, or<br>\
warring and plundering, party was made to be<br>\
followed by another, consisting of the likes of it,<br>\
sent in its place. (TA.) And it is said in a trad.<br>\
of &#39;Omar, كَانَ كُلَّ عَامٍ يُعَقِّبُ الجُيُوشَ He used,<br>\
every year, to call back one party of the forces<br>\
and to send another to take its turn after the<br>\
former. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The performing of<br>\
prayer (IAth, O, K, TA) as a supererogatory<br>\
act (TA) after the [prayers called] تَرَاوِيح:<br>\
(IAth, O, K, TA:) such prayer is to be performed in the house, at home, (IAth, O, TA,)<br>\
not in the mosque. (IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And The<br>\
waiting (K, TA) in prayer; or remaining in one&#39;s<br>\
place in prayer waiting for another prayer. (TA.)<br>\
And you say, عقّب فِى الصَّلَاةِ, (S, O,) inf. n. as<br>\
above, (S, A, O, Msb, K,) He sat after the performing of the [ordinary] prayer for the purpose<br>\
of a supplication (S, A, O, Msb, K) or a petition. (S, O, Msb.) وَلَّى مُدْبِرًا وَلَمْ يُعَقِّبْ, in the<br>\
Kur [xxvii. 10 and xxviii. 31], means [He did<br>\
did not turn back retreating] and did not wait;<br>\
(O, TA;) properly, did not make advancing to<br>\
follow his retreating: (O:) or and did not turn<br>\
aside (S, Msb) nor wait in expectation: (S:) or<br>\
and did not turn aside nor return: (O:) or and<br>\
did not look aside: (K, * TA.) or and did not<br>\
return; from عقّب said of a combatant, meaning<br>\
He returned after fleeing: (Bd in xxvii. 10:)<br>\
you say, عقّب عَلَيْهِ He returned against him;<br>\
syn. كَرَّ, and رَجَعَ: and تَعْقِيبٌ signifies also The<br>\
turning back, or receding, from a thing that one<br>\
had desired to do. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  عَقَّبَ فِى الشَّيْبِ<br>\
بِأَخْلَاقٍ حَسَنَةٍ [app. means He had latterly, in the<br>\
time of hoariness, good dispositions]. (O. [The<br>\
meaning that I have assigned to this phrase<br>\
seems to be there indicated by the context: but<br>\
I incline to think that the right reading is عُقِّبَ,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  lit. He was made to be followed, in hoariness,<br>\
by good dispositions; agreeably with what next<br>\
follows.]) ―<br>\
-b6-  آتَى فُلَانٌ إِلَىَّ خَيْرًا فَعُقِّبَ بِخَيْرٍ مِنْهُ<br>\
[means Such a one caused good to betide me, and<br>\

than it]. (A, TA. [In the former it is followed<br>\
by the words وَأَرْدِفَ بِخَيْرٍ مِنْهُ, evidently for the<br>\
purpose of explanation.]) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence,] one says,<br>\
تَصَدَّقَ بِصَدَقَةٍ لَيْسَ فِيهَا تَعْقِيبٌ, meaning اِسْتِشْنَآءٌ [i. e.<br>\
He gave an alms in which was no making an exception by following it up with a condition]. (S,<br>\
A, O, Msb. *) ―<br>\
-b8-  عَقَّبَنِى حَقِّى He delayed, or deferred, the giving, or paying, to me my due. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\

-b10-  And عقّب فِى الأَمْرِ He went repeatedly to and fro, or made repeated efforts, in<br>\
seeking to accomplish the affair, striving, or<br>\
exerting himself. (S, O, L, TA.) In the K,<br>\
التَّعْقِيبُ [the inf. n.] is expl. as signifying التَّرَدُّدُ<br>\
فِى طَلَبِ المَجْدِ: but the right reading is فِى<br>\

(Mgh,) He did a thing with the man alternately,<br>\

الرَّجُلَ فِى الرَّاحِلَةِ I rode in my turn after the<br>\
man, upon the camel, he riding in his turn after<br>\
me. (S, O.) And in like manner you say,<br>\
↓ اِعْتَقَبُوهُ, and ↓ تَعَاقَبُوهُ They rode by turns with<br>\
him, taking their turns after him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
عاقب بَيْنَ الشَّيْئَيْنِ [He made an interchange, or<br>\
alternation between the two things; he made the<br>\
two things interchangeable, or commutable;] he<br>\
brought, or did, the two things interchangeably, or<br>\
alternately, i. e. one of them one time and the<br>\
other of them another time. (TA.) [Thus, for<br>\
instance,] العَرَبُ تُعَاقِبُ بَيْنَ الفَآءِ والثَّآءِ [The Arabs<br>\
make an interchange between ف and ث; make<br>\
ف and ث interchangeable, or commutable; i. e.<br>\
put ف in the place of ث, and ث in the place of<br>\
ف]; as in جَدَفٌ and جَدَثٌ; and ↓ تُعْقِبُ signifies the same. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عاقب signifies<br>\
also He stood upon one of his legs one time and<br>\
upon the other another time; or moved his legs<br>\
alternately. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [عاقبهُ as denoting consequence, and retaliation, or retribution, also signifies He punished him.] You say, عاقبهُ بِذَنْبِهِ,<br>\
(S, Msb, * TA,) inf. n. عِقَابٌ (S, Msb, TA) and<br>\
مُعَاقَبَةٌ, (Msb, TA,) He punished him for his<br>\
crime, sin, fault, or offence: (S, * Msb, * TA:)<br>\
and [in like manner] ↓ تعقّبهُ He punished him<br>\
(i. e. a man, S, O) for a crime, a sin, a fault, or<br>\
an offence, that he had committed. (S, O, K.)<br>\
In the saying in the Kur [xvi. last verse but one],<br>\
وَإِنْ عَاقَبْتُمْ فَعَاقِبُوا بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبْتُمٌ بِهِ [And if ye<br>\
punish, then punish ye with the like of that with<br>\
which ye have been afflicted, lit. punished], the<br>\
verb first denotes punishment, and is afterwards<br>\
used for the purpose of assimilation: and similar<br>\
to this is the saying in the same [xxii. 59],<br>\
وَمَنْ عَاقَبَ بِمِثْلِ مَا عُوقِبَ بِهِ [And whoso punisheth<br>\
with the like of that with which he hath been afflicted, lit. punished]. (O.) For another ex.,<br>\
from the Kur lx. 11, [where it implies retaliation<br>\
or retribution,] see 1, latter half. [In like manner,]<br>\
it is said in a trad., أَبْطَلَ النَّفْحَ إِلَّا أَنْ يُضْرَبَ<br>\
فَيُعَاقِبَ [He made the kicking of a beast with the<br>\
hind leg to be of no account unless it were beaten<br>\
by its master, or rider, and retaliated by kicking<br>\
another person]; meaning, he made nothing to<br>\
be incumbent on the master of the beast unless<br>\
the latter made the kicking to be a consequence<br>\
of that [i. e. unless the beast kicked in consequence of its being beaten by the master, or<br>\
rider]. (TA.) [See also 4, which has a similar<br>\
meaning, that of requital.] ―<br>\
-b6-  عُوقِبَتْ said of a<br>\
mare means She was required to perform run<br>\
after run. (Ham p. 277.)<br>\
4<br>\
اعقبهُ: see 1, first quarter, in three places:<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  and see 3, in three places. ―<br>\
-b3-  [Also He made<br>\
him to take his place. And hence,] He descended<br>\
from his beast in order that he (another) might<br>\
ride in his turn: and one says also أَعْقِبْ meaning<br>\
Descend thou in order that I may ride in my turn:<br>\
and in like manner with respect to any kind of<br>\
action: thus, when the office of Khaleefeh became<br>\
transferred from the sons of Umeiyeh to the<br>\
Háshimees, Sudeyf, the poet of the &#39;Abbásees,<br>\
said,<br>\
أَعْقِبِى آلَ هَاشِمٍ يَا مَيَّا<br>\
meaning Descend from the station of the Khaleefehs that the family of Háshim may mount, O<br>\
Meiyà [for O sons of Umeiyeh]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
[And It made a thing to follow as a consequence<br>\
to him: the verb in this sense being doubly<br>\
trans.] One says, اعقبهُ نَدَمًا It occasioned him<br>\
as its consequence repentance, (Mgh, Msb, TA,)<br>\
and هَمًّا anxiety. (TA.) And أَكَلَ أَكْلَةً أَعْقَبَتْهُ<br>\
سَقَمًا He ate a repast that occasioned him as its<br>\
consequence a sickness. (S, O.) And [hence] أُعْقِبَ<br>\
عِزُّهُ ذُلًّا His might was exchanged for, or changed<br>\
into, [lit. made to be followed by,] abasement.<br>\
(TA.) See also 2, first quarter, for another ex.<br>\
[Hence, likewise,] فَأَعْقَبَهُمْ نِفَاقًا, in the Kur<br>\
[ix. 78], means [Therefore He caused hypocrisy<br>\
to follow as a consequence to them; or] He caused<br>\
them to err, because of their evil deed, as a punishment to them. (O.) And [in like manner] one<br>\
says, أَعْقَبَهُ اللّٰهُ بِإِحْسَانِهِ خَيْرًا [God gave him, or<br>\
may God give him, as a recompense, or requital,<br>\
for his beneficence, good, or prosperity]. (TA.)<br>\
And اعقبهُ بِطَاعَتِهِ He recompensed, or requited,<br>\
him for his obedience, (S, O, K, *) and عَلَى مَا صَنَعَ<br>\
for what he did. (TA. [See also 3, which has a<br>\
similar meaning, that of retribution.]) اعقبهُ خَيْرًا<br>\
means also He gave him in exchange good. (TA.)<br>\
See also 1, latter half, where the verb is expl. in<br>\
the contr. sense, that of taking, or receiving, in<br>\
exchange. ―<br>\
-b5-  اعقبهُ الطَّائِفُ The diabolical visitation, or insanity, returned to him at times. (S, O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  اعقب طَىَّ البِئْرِ بِحِجَارَةٍ مِنْ وَرَائِهَا [is app. from<br>\
أَعْقَابُ الطَّىِّ (see عَقِبٌ), and] means He laid stones<br>\
compactly together at the back [behind the regular<br>\
casing] of the well. (TA. [See also 1, near the<br>\
end.])<br>\
-A2- اعقب as intrans., He (a man) died,<br>\
and left offspring. (S, O, K.) One says, أَعْقَبَ<br>\
مِنْهُمْ رَجُلَانِ وَدَرَجَ وَاحِدٌ [Two men of them died<br>\
and left offspring, and one died and left no offspring]: and Tufeyl El-Ghanawee says,<br>\
كَرِيمَةُ حُرِّ الوَجْهِ لَمْ تَدْعُ هَالِكًا<br>\
↓ مِنَ القَوْمِ هُلْكًا فِى غَدٍ غَيْرَ مُعْقِبِ<br>\
[A female noble of countenance, (or whose nobility<br>\
was manifest in what appeared of her countenance,)<br>\
she did not invoke one of the people dead, on a<br>\

TA. [In my copies of the S, and in the O, الخَيْرِ:<br>\
but see what follows; in which مُتَعَقَّب is used as<br>\
a noun of place of the verb in this sense.]) Tufeyl<br>\
says,<br>\
↓ وَلَمْ يَكُ عَمَّا خَبَّرُوا مُتَعَقَّبُ<br>\
[And there was no place of, or ground for, doubting, and asking again, respecting what they told].<br>\
(S, O, TA.) And one says, لَمْ أَجِدْ عَنْ قَوْلِكَ<br>\
↓ مُتَعَقَّبًا, (A, TA,) i. e. [I found not] any place<br>\
of, or ground for, inquiring into, or investigating,<br>\
thy saying; syn. مُتَفَحَّصًا; (A, TA;) [or questioning it; or returning to examine it;] meaning,<br>\
thy saying was right and true, so that it did not<br>\
require التَّعَقُّب; (A;) or I did not allow myself<br>\
to doubt, and ask again, respecting it, that I<br>\
might see whether I should do what thou saidst<br>\
or abstain from it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And the verb is<br>\
used transitively in a similar sense.] You say,<br>\
تعقّب الخَبَرَ He searched after the information<br>\
repeatedly, or time after time; (Mgh, * TA;)<br>\
syn. تَتَبَّعَ: (Mgh, TA:) and ↓ اعتقب has a like<br>\
meaning. (Ham p. 287.) And He asked respecting the information another person than the one<br>\
whom he asked the first time. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
تَعَقَّبْتُ الرَّجُلَ I sought to discover in the man that<br>\
which he would be ashamed to expose; or the slip,<br>\
or fault, that he had committed: and ↓ اِسْتَعْقَبْتُهُ<br>\
signifies the same. (O, K. *) [In critical observations and the like, تعقّبهُ is often used as meaning He found fault with him; animadverted upon<br>\
him; or impugned his judgment or assertion;<br>\
بِقَوْلِهِ كَذَا وَكَذَا by his saying so and so. And<br>\
تعقّب عَلَيْهِ seems to be similarly used as meaning<br>\
He animadverted upon his saying: (compare<br>\
اِعْتَرَضَ عَلَيْهِ:) but more commonly as meaning<br>\
he animadverted upon it, i. e. a saying, and the<br>\
like.] ―<br>\

يَتَعَاقَبَانِ (T, S, O, Msb, TA) They follow<br>\
each other [by turns]; or alternate; (T, Msb,<br>\

said of the night and the day; (T, Msb;) or as<br>\
the night and the day; (S, O, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ يَعْتَقِبَانِ. (TA.) You say, تَعَاقَبَ المُسَافِرَانِ<br>\
عَلَى الدَّابَّةِ The two travellers rode upon the beast,<br>\
each of them in his turn. (TA: and the like is<br>\
said in the Msb.) And تعاقبا عَمَلًا They two did<br>\
a work, or deed, by turns, or alternately: syn.<br>\
اِرْتَوَحَاهُ, (K and TA in art. روح,) and تَرَاوَحَاهُ<br>\
(TA in that art.) And تعاقبا They helped each<br>\
other by turns. (TA.) And بِالضَّرْبِ ↓ يَعْتَقبَانِهِ<br>\
They two ply him by turns with beating (A.) See<br>\
also 3, near the beginning. التَّعَاقُبُ also signifies<br>\

-b3-  [اعتقبهُ signifies also He<br>\
took it, or had it, subsequently. Thus one of the<br>\
meanings of العُقْبَةُ is expl. in the A and TA by<br>\
the words مَا يَعْتَقِبُونَهُ بَعْدَ الطَّعَامِ مِنَ الحَلَاوَةِ i. e.<br>\
What they have, or take, after the main portion<br>\
of the meal, consisting of sweetmeat. ―<br>\

act &amp;c.: and that it may have ↓ مُعْتَقَبُ for an<br>\
inf. n. in this sense (as well as in other senses<br>\
agreeably with analogy) seems to be meant by<br>\
its being said (in the Ham p. 287) that المُعْتَقَبُ<br>\
signifies أَخْذُ عُقْبَةِ الشَّىْءِ i. e. آخِرِهِ. See also a<br>\
somewhat similar signification of 5.] One says,<br>\
فَعَلْتُ كَذَا فَاعْتَقَبْتُ مِنْهُ نَدَامَةً i. e. [I did such a<br>\
thing and] I found, or experienced, in consequence<br>\
thereof repentance; (S, O;) as also ↓ اِسْتَعْقَبْتُ.<br>\
(A, O.) And مِنْ كَذَا خَيْرًا ↓ استعقب He found,<br>\
or experienced, in consequence of such a thing, or<br>\
after such a thing, good. (T, Msb.) And hence,<br>\
perhaps, the saying of the lawyers, يَصِحُّ الشِّرَآءُ<br>\
عِتْقًا ↓ إِذَا اسْتَعْقَبَ [as meaning The sale, or purchase, is valid when it has emancipation as an<br>\
after-event]: but this does not agree with the<br>\
former phrase unless by a far-fetched interpretation; and therefore one should say, إِذَا عَقَبَهُ العِتْقُ<br>\
i. e. when emancipation follows it. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
اعتقب also signifies He withheld, or detained, a<br>\
thing in his possession. (TA.) And [particularly]<br>\
He (a seller) withheld, or detained, an article of<br>\
merchandise from the purchaser until he should<br>\
receive the price: (S, A, O, K:) for the doing<br>\
of which he is said in a trad. to be responsible;<br>\
meaning, if it perish in his keeping. (S, A, O.)<br>\

are made: (S, O, K: [see also 1, last quarter:])<br>\
n. un. with 3: (S, O:) or such as are white of the<br>\
أَطْنَاب of the joints; (Mgh, Msb; [see عَصَبٌ;])<br>\
the عَصَب being such as are yellow: (Mgh and<br>\
Msb in art. عصب:) accord. to IAth, the عَصَب<br>\
[or sinews, or tendons,] of the two portions of<br>\
flesh next the back-bone on either side, and of the<br>\
سَاقَانِ and وَظِيفَانِ [meaning the hind and fore<br>\
shanks], that are intermingled with the flesh, of<br>\
any animal; the half of one whereof, divided<br>\
lengthwise from the other half, is extended, or<br>\
drown out, and trimmed, and cleansed of the<br>\
flesh, and the وَتَر [or string for the bow or the<br>\
like] is made thereof; and they are sometimes in<br>\
the two sides of the camel; but [properly speaking]<br>\
there is a difference between the عَصَب and the<br>\
عقَب; the former being such as incline to yellow,<br>\
whereas the latter incline to white, and are the<br>\
harder, and firmer, or stronger, of the two:<br>\
AHn says, on the authority of Aboo-Ziyád, that<br>\
the عَقَب are [the sinews, or tendons,] of the two<br>\
portions of flesh next the back-bone on either side,<br>\
of the sheep or goat, and of the camel, and of the<br>\
ox or cow,(TA.) [See also عِلْبَآءٌ.]<br>\
عَقِبٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ عَقْبٌ,<br>\

hinder part of the foot of a human being: (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, K:) of the fem. gender: (S, O,<br>\
Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَعْقُبٌ (TA) and [of mult.<br>\
as well as of pauc.] أَعْقَابٌ: (Msb, TA:) and<br>\
↓ عَقِيبٌ is said to signify the same; but MF<br>\
cites an assertion that this is a word of a bad<br>\
dialect. (TA.) وَيْلٌ لِلْأَعْقَابِ مِنَ النَّارِ [Wo to<br>\
the heels from the fire of Hell], (O, Msb, TA,)<br>\
and ويل لِلْعَقِبِ من النّار [Who to the heel &amp;c.],<br>\
(TA,) occurring in a trad., means wo to him who<br>\
neglects the washing of the heels in the ablution<br>\
preparatory to prayer. (O, * Msb, TA. *) عَقِبُ<br>\
الشَّيْطَانِ, (O, Msb, TA,) or, as some say, ↓ عُقْبَةُ<br>\
الشيطان, (Msb, TA,) with damm, (TA,) which<br>\
is forbidden in prayer, is expl. as meaning The<br>\
placing the buttocks upon the heels between the two<br>\
prostrations; which is what some term الإِقْعَآءُ:<br>\
(Mgh, * O, Msb, TA:) so says A&#39;Obeyd: (Msb:)<br>\

heels unwashed in the ablution preparatory to<br>\
prayer. (O.) وَطِئَ النَّاسُ عَقِبَ فُلَانٍ [lit. The<br>\
people trod upon the heel of such a one] means<br>\
the people walked after, or near after, such a<br>\
one: and in like manner, هُوَ مُوَطَّأُ العَقِبِ [lit. He<br>\
is one whose heel is trodden upon]: (O, TA; *)<br>\
because of his having command over people, and<br>\
their being submissive to him: (O:) the latter<br>\
phrase means he is one who has many followers:<br>\
(A, TA: [see also art. وطأ:]) جَآءَ زَيْدٌ يَطَأُ عَقِبَ<br>\

or Whence hast thou come? (A, O, TA.) And<br>\

way of his heel; i. e., by the way that was behind<br>\
him, and whence he had come; quickly. (Msb.)<br>\
And وَلَّى عَلَى عَقِبِهِ, and عَلَى عَقِبَيْهِ, He turned<br>\
back, or receded, from a thing to which he had<br>\
betaken himself. (TA.) لَا تَرُدَّهُمْ عَلَى أَعْقَابِهِمْ,<br>\
occurring in a trad., means Turn not thou them<br>\
back to their former condition of not emigrating<br>\
[for the sake of religion]: and مَا زَالُوا مُرْتَدِّينَ<br>\
عَلَى أَعْقَابِهِمْ, in another trad., means They ceased<br>\
not to return to infidelity: as though they went<br>\
back wards. (TA.) ―<br>\

said, لَكَ فِى الخَيْرِ ↓ العُقْبَى meaning العَاقِبَةُ [i. e.<br>\

meaning He journeyed in the end, or the last, or<br>\
latter, part, of Ramadán: (T, Msb:) or, when<br>\
Ramadán had almost ended. (O.) One says,<br>\

is in the state of convalescence in which somewhat<br>\
remains of the disease: (Msb:) and فِى أَعْقَابِ<br>\
المَرَضِ in the [state in which there are some] remains of the disease. (TA.) One says also, جَآءَ<br>\
فِى عَقِبِهِ and ↓ عَقْبِهِ, meaning He came after him;<br>\
or near after him; [as though at his heel; and<br>\
hence, properly, close after him;] and جَآءَ عَقِبَهُ;<br>\

And جِئْتُ فِى عَقِبِ الشَّهْرِ i. e. I came after the<br>\
month had passed. (El-Fárábee, Msb.) And خَلَفَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ بعَقِبِى Such a one remained, or stayed, after<br>\

sufficient authorities for its use in this sense have<br>\
been cited above: though it seems from what<br>\
here follows that عُقُبَ or عُقْبَ in this sense is<br>\
preferable.] One says, شَهْرِ ↓ جِئْتُ فِى عُقْبِ<br>\

also, آلِ فُلَانٍ ↓ فُلَانٌ يَسْتَقِى عَلَى عُقْبَةِ Such a one<br>\
draws water after the family of such a one. (TA.)<br>\
And MF mentions ↓ جِئْتُكَ عَلَى عَاقِبِهِ [app. meaning I came to thee after him, or it]: and Aboo-Mis-hal mentions [app. in this sense] ↓ عِقْبَانِهِ,<br>\

offspring; (Mgh;) and so ↓ عَاقِبَةٌ: (Msb:) or<br>\
his male children: and, accord. to some of the<br>\
lawyers, the children of the daughters [of a man,<br>\

no male offspring remaining to him: (TA:) and<br>\

no [remaining] child, or children. (S, O, Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  شَىْءٍ ↓ عَقْبُ [or عَقِبُ شَىْءٍ] signifies A thing,<br>\

run, of a horse: (IAar, Msb:) or one says of a<br>\
courser, هُوَ ذُوْ عَفْوٍ وَعَقِبٍ meaning He has a first<br>\
run, and a subsequent, and more vehement, run:<br>\
(A:) and ↓ عِقَابٌ is said in the L to have the first<br>\
of these meanings: (TA:) or it is pl. of عَقْبٌ [or<br>\
عَقِبٌ] as having that meaning: (Ham p. 358:)<br>\
an ex. of it occurs in the following verse, (Ham,<br>\
TA,) cited by IAar: (TA:)<br>\
يَمْلَأُ عَيْنَيْكَ بِالفِنَآءِ وَيُرْ<br>\
ضِيكَ عِقَابًا إِنْ شِئْتَ أَوْ نَزَقَا<br>\
[That would satisfy thine eye by his beauty, in the<br>\
area before the dwelling, and content thee by run<br>\
after run, or by runs after runs, if thou wilt, or<br>\
by lightness, or agility]: (Ham, TA:) [or it may<br>\
be here an inf. n., (of 3,) meaning on an occasion<br>\
of being required to perform run after run: (see<br>\
3, last sentence:)] or, accord. to IAar, the meaning in this instance is, by his owner&#39;s making, upon<br>\
him, warring, or warring and plundering, expeditions time after time: (TA:) accord. to Kh,<br>\
لَهُ عِقَابٌ, said of a horse, means he has a recovering of strength (جمام [i. e. جَمَامٌ]) after ceasing<br>\
to run. (Ham ubi suprà.) ―<br>\

dismounts, for example in the morning, and he<br>\
(the former) rides. (Mgh.) And [the pl.] عُقَبٌ<br>\
means [particularly] The turns of camels, when<br>\
they are being watered: the watering of a number<br>\
of camels together after another number is termed<br>\
their عُقْبَة. (TA.) [See also عُقْبَى.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And [it<br>\
is said that] it means also Camels which a man<br>\

[but this I would rather render, Verily I have<br>\
incumbent on me a turn to pasture and water<br>\
camels; and I perform it; I am not a neglecter<br>\
thereof nor a delayer of it]; meaning I drive the<br>\
camels which I pasture and water in my turn,<br>\

[Soft, or tender, heavy in the hinder part, that<br>\

[kind of plants termed] حَمْض after the [kind<br>\
termed] خُلَّة; (A, L;) or upon the خُلَّة after the<br>\

-b11-  And The remains of the contents of a<br>\
cooking-pot, adhering to the bottom. (TA.) And<br>\

عُقْبَةَ الصُّنْعِ, meaning I experienced from him, or<br>\
it, difficulty: [as though lit. signifying, the result<br>\
of the deed that I had done:] and [simply]<br>\
لَقِىَ مِنْهُ عُقْبَةً He experienced from him, or it,<br>\
difficulty. (TA. [But in a copy of the A, and<br>\
in my opinion correctly, the last word in this<br>\
phrase is written ↓ عَقَبَةً: see عَقَبَةٌ, below.]) ―<br>\
-b14-<br>\
And كُنْتُ مَرَّةً نُشْبَة وَأَنَا اليَوْمَ عُقْبَة, expl. by IAar<br>\
as meaning I was such that, when I clung to a<br>\
man, he experienced evil from me; but now I<br>\
have reverted from being such, through weakness.<br>\
(TA. [It is a prov., somewhat differently related<br>\
in art. نشب, q. v.]) ―<br>\

عِقْبَةٌ (Lh, S, O, K) and ↓ عُقْبَةٌ, (Lh, O, K,)<br>\
but the former is the more approved, (Lh, TA,)<br>\
and عقب, (so in the TA, [app., if not a mistranscription, ↓ عَقِبٌ,]) A mark, sign, trace, impress,<br>\
characteristic, or outward indication. (Lh, S, O,<br>\

is the mark &amp;c. [of generosity and manliness, and<br>\
of beauty]. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عِقْبَةُ القَمَرِ and ↓ عَقْبَةُ<br>\
القمر mean The return of the moon, when it has<br>\
set, or disappeared, and then risen: (L:) [or the<br>\
return of the moon after the change; for] one<br>\
says, مَا يَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ إِلَّا عِقْبَةَ القَمَرِ, (S,) or ↓ عُقْبَةَ<br>\
القمر, (so in the O,) meaning He does not that<br>\
save once in each month: (S, O:) but, accord. to<br>\
IAar, القَمَرِ ↓ عُقْبَةُ, with damm, is a certain star,<br>\
or asterism, which is in conjunction with the moon<br>\
once in the year; and عُقْبَةَ القَمَرِ means once in<br>\
the year: so in the following verse, of one of the<br>\
Benoo-&#39;Ámir:<br>\
لَا يُطْعِمُ المِسْكَ وَالكَافُورَ لِمَّتَهُ<br>\
وَلَا الذَّرِيرَةَ إِلَّا عُقْبَةَ القَمَرِ<br>\
[He will not apply to his hair that descends below<br>\
the ear musk and camphor, nor the perfume called<br>\
ذريرة, save once in the year]: or, as Lh relates<br>\
it, عِقْبَةَ القمر: thus in the L; in which it is added<br>\
that this saying of IAar requires consideration,<br>\
because the moon cuts [a meridian of] the celestial<br>\
sphere once in every month: but MF replies that<br>\
it may be in conjunction with the said star only<br>\
once in the year, as the moon&#39;s path varies in<br>\
each successive month. (TA. [See also عَقْمَةٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  See also عَقْبَةٌ.<br>\
عَقَبَةٌ [A mountain-road;] a road in [or upon]<br>\
a mountain: (Bd in xc. 11:) or a road in the<br>\
upper part of a mountain: (Ham p. 287:) or a<br>\
difficult place of ascent of the mountains: (K:)<br>\
or it is in a mountain and the like thereof: (Msb:)<br>\
or [it sometimes signifies] a long mountain that<br>\
lies across the way, and over which the way therefore leads; long, or high, and very difficult; so<br>\
called, too, when it is further impassable after it<br>\
is ascended; rising high towards the sky, ascending and descending; most difficult of ascent; but<br>\
sometimes its height is one [or uniform]; and its<br>\
acclivity is in appearance like a wall: (TA:)<br>\
[generally it means a road over, or up, or down,<br>\
or over some part of, a mountain:] pl. عِقَابٌ.<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K.) اِقْتَحَمَ العَقَبَةَ [properly signifying He attempted the mountain-road] is metaphorically used as meaning He entered upon a<br>\
hard, or difficult, affair. (Bd in xc. 11.) See<br>\
also عُقْبَةٌ, near the end. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also n. un. of<br>\
عَقَبٌ [q. v.]. (S, O.)<br>\
عُقْبَى: see عَقِبٌ, second quarter, in four places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  It occurs in a trad. respecting the prayer of<br>\
fear; in which it is said of that prayer, كَانَتْ<br>\
عُقْبَى [It was an affair of turns]; meaning that<br>\
it was performed by one company after another;<br>\
several companies performing it successively, by<br>\
turns. (TA. [Compare عُقْبَةٌ as expl. in the<br>\
third sentence of the paragraph on that word.])<br>\

its correctness. (TA.)<br>\
عُقَابٌ [The eagle;] a certain bird, (S, O, K,)<br>\
of those that prey, (Msb,) well known: (K:) of<br>\
the fem. gender: (S, O, Msb:) [though] applied<br>\
to the male and the female; but with this distinction, that you say of the male, هٰذَا عُقَابٌ ذَكَرٌ<br>\
[This is a male eagle]: or it is only female; and<br>\
a bird of another kind couples with it; whence<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Oneyn says, satirizing a person named Ibn-Seyyideh, Say thou to Ibn-Seyyideh,<br>\
مَا أَنْتَ إِلَّا كَالْعُقَابِ فَأُمُّهُ<br>\
مَعْرُوفَةٌ وَلَهُ أَبٌ مَجْهُولُ<br>\
[“ Thou art not other than the like of the eagle; ”<br>\
for his mother is known, but he has a father unknown]: (MF, TA:) the pl. (of pauc., S, O) is<br>\
أَعْقُبٌ, (S, O, K,) because it is of the fem. gender<br>\
and the measure أَفْعُلٌ specially belongs to pls. of<br>\
fem. nouns [though not to such exclusively], (S,<br>\
O,) and أَعْقِبَةٌ, (Kr, TA,) and (of mult., S, O)<br>\
عِقْبَانٌ (S, O, K) and عَقَائِبُ accord. to AHei, but<br>\
Ed-Demámeenee thinks this to be strange; and<br>\
pl. pl. عَقَابِينُ. (TA.) عِقْبَانُ الجِرْذَانِ [The eagles<br>\
that prey upon the large field-rats] are not black,<br>\
but of the colour termed كُهْبَة; and no use is<br>\
made of their feathers, except that boys feather<br>\
with them round-topped pointless arrows. (AHn,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] العُقَابُ is the name of (assumed tropical:)  One of<br>\
the northern constellations, [i. e. Aquila,] the stars<br>\
of which are nine within the figure, and six without, of the former of which are three well known,<br>\
called النَّسْرُ الطَّائِرُ [q. v.]. (Kzw.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence<br>\
also,] (assumed tropical:)  The عُقَاب of the banner, or standard; (S,<br>\
O;) [app. meaning the flag attached to a lance;]<br>\
what is bound [to a lance] for a prefect, or governor; likened to the bird so called; and of the<br>\
fem. gender. (L, TA.) It is also the name of<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The banner, or standard, of the Prophet. (O,<br>\
K.) And عُقَابٌ also means (assumed tropical:)  A large banner or<br>\
standard. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  i. q. غَايَةٌ: so in the<br>\
saying of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, describing wine,<br>\
لَهَا غَايَةٌ تَهْدِى الكِرَامَ عُقَابُهَا<br>\
[meaning It has a banner, which guides the generous; like as the military banner guides and attracts warriors: for غَايَةٌ sometimes signifies a<br>\
sign which the vintner used to set up to attract<br>\
customers]: the repetition is approvable because<br>\
of the difference of the two words in themselves:<br>\
pl. عِقْبَانٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عُقَابٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
black she-camel; as being likened to the bird. [so<br>\
called], (AA, O.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And A stone (or piece of<br>\
rock, L) protruding in the inside of a well, which<br>\
lacerates the [leathern] bucket; (S, O, K, TA;)<br>\
sometimes it is before [i. e. above] the casing [of<br>\
stones or bricks]: it is when a mass of stone becomes displaced; and sometimes the water-drawer<br>\
stands upon it: it is of the fem. gender: pl. as<br>\
above. (TA.) And The stone upon which the<br>\
waterer stands, (O, K,) [accord. to SM,] projecting beyond the casing in a well, the same that<br>\
is meant in the next preceding sentence, (TA,)<br>\
[but this I think doubtful, for Sgh adds,] between<br>\
two stones which support it. (O.) Accord. to<br>\
IAar, the قَبِيلَة is a mass of stone, or rock, at the<br>\
mouth of a well; and the عُقَابَانِ are [two masses<br>\
of stone] at the two sides of the قبيلة, supporting<br>\
it. (TA.) And A rock, or mass of stone, projecting in the side of a mountain, like a stair, or<br>\

latter is bound, or fastened: (O:) or, accord. to<br>\
Az, the thread that binds the two extremities of the<br>\
ring of the قُرْط. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  Accord. to Th, it signifies also Garments of the kind called أَبْرَاد [pl. of<br>\

A ploughshare]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-  See also أَعْقَابٌ. ―<br>\
-b13-<br>\
And العُقَابَانِ signifies Two pieces of wood between<br>\
which a man is extended to be flogged: (L, TA:)<br>\
or two pieces of wood which are set up, stuck in<br>\
the ground, between which he who is beaten, or he<br>\

العِدَّةُ عَقِيبٌ لِلطَّلَاقِ [The عِدَّة (q. v.) is a sequent<br>\
to divorcement], i. e., one follows the other;<br>\
(Msb;) and [by alternation,] as when one says of<br>\
the night and the day, كُلُّ وَاحِدٍ مِنْهُمَا عَقِيبُ<br>\
صَاحِبِهِ [Each of them is the alternating sequent<br>\
of its correlative]: (Az, Msb, TA:) you say of<br>\
the night and the day, هُمَا عَقِيبَانِ [They are two<br>\
alternating sequents]; and عَقِيبُكَ signifies He<br>\
who does a deed, or work, with thee by turn, he<br>\
doing it one time and thou another: (A, * TA:)<br>\
and ↓ مُعَاقِبٌ signifies the same, (S, Msb,) as also<br>\
[↓ مُعْقِبٌ and ↓ مُعْتَقِبٌ and] ↓ مُعَقِّبٌ. (Msb.) As<br>\
for the saying of the lawyers, يَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ عَقِيبَ<br>\
الصَّلَاةِ [meaning He does that after the prayer],<br>\
and the like thereof, there is no reason to be<br>\
given but a suppression; the meaning being, فِى<br>\
وَقْتٍ عَقِيب وَقْتِ الصَّلَاةِ [in a time following that of<br>\
prayer], عقيب being an epithet qualifying وقت:<br>\
(Msb:) and Er-Rázee says, in the Mukhtár es-<br>\

denotes intensiveness of quality, as in the cases<br>\
of أَسَدٌ أَسِدٌ and كَلْبٌ كَلِبٌ: accord. to Lth,<br>\
عَقْنْبَاةٌ applied to an عُقَاب signifies cunning: and<br>\
the pl. is عَقَنْبَيَاتٌ. (TA.) [See also art. عبق.]<br>\
عَاقِبٌ [act. part. n. of عَقَبَ;] Coming after<br>\
[&amp;c.]. (Msb.) عَاقِبُ شَىْءٍ means Any person<br>\

تَعْقِيبَةٌ a modern word signifying A catchword at the bottom of a page: pl. تَعَاقِيبُ.]<br>\
مُعْقَبٌ [appears, from what here follows, to be<br>\
used for مُعْقَبٌ حَالُهُ i. e. One whose state is<br>\
changed]. IAar cites as an ex. of this word,<br>\
كُلُّ حَىٍّ مُعْقَبٌ عُقَبَا<br>\
meaning [Every living being] comes to a state different from that in which he was [by turns, or<br>\
time after time]. (TA.)<br>\
مُعْقِبٌ [accord. to the O, مِعْقَبٌ, but this I<br>\
think a mistranscription,] A star that succeeds,<br>\
i. e. rises after, another star, (S, K, TA,) and on<br>\
the rising of which, he who rides in his turn, after<br>\
another, mounts the beast: (TA:) a star at the<br>\
appearance of which two persons who ride by turns<br>\
during a journey take each the other&#39;s place; when<br>\
one star sets and another rises, he who was walking<br>\
mounts the beast. (AO.) See عَقِيبٌ.<br>\

TA;) so called because it takes the place of the<br>\
مُلَآءَة. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And An ear-drop; syn. قُرْطٌ.<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\
مُعَقَّبٌ One who is made to go forth, (so in the<br>\

applied as an epithet to an angel; that one says<br>\
مَلَكَ مُعَقِّبٌ [meaning An angel that follows another]; and مَلَائِكَةٌ مُعَقِّبَةٌ; and that مُعَقِّبَاتٌ is a<br>\
pl. pl. (O.) المُعَقِّبَاتُ means The angels of the<br>\
night and the day; (S, O, K;) because they succeed one another by turns; and the fem. form is<br>\
used because of the frequency of their doing so,<br>\
in like manner as it is in the words نَسَّابَةٌ and<br>\
عَلَّامَةٌ: (S, O:) the angles called الحَفَظَةُ [pl. of<br>\
حَافِظٌ, q. v.]: so in the Kur xiii. 12: in which<br>\
some of the Arabs of the desert read مَعَاقِيبُ:<br>\
(TA:) this [may be an anomalous pl. of عَقِيبٌ,<br>\
like as مَهَاجِينُ is of هَجِينٌ, or it] is pl. of مُعَقِّبٌ<br>\
or of مُعَقِّبَةٌ, the ى being to compensate for the suppression of one of the two ق. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b3-  المُعَقِّبَاتُ<br>\
also signifies The she-camels that stand behind<br>\
those that are pressing towards the wateringtrough, or tank; so that when one she-camel goes<br>\
away, another comes in her place. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And The ejaculations of سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ, which follow<br>\
one another, (O, K,) repeated at the end of the<br>\
ordinary prayer, thirty-three in number, and<br>\
which are followed by اَلْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ thirty-three times,<br>\
and اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرْ thirty-four times. (O.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
مُعَقِّبٌ signifies also One who makes repeatedly<br>\

it: or one who follows close after a man, for<br>\
something that is his due: one who seeks to recover<br>\
his right, or due: and one who, being despoiled of<br>\
all his property in a hostile attack, makes a hostile<br>\
attack upon him from whom he has thus suffered,<br>\
and endeavours to recover his property. (TA.)<br>\
Lebeed says, describing a [wild] he-ass and his<br>\
female,<br>\
حَتَّى تَهَجَّرَ بِالرَّوَاحِ وَهَاجَهَا<br>\
طَلَبَ المُعَقِّبِ حَقَّهُ المُظْلُومُ<br>\
(S, O, but in the latter فِى الرَّوَاحِ,) i. e. [Until he<br>\
went along in the midday heat, (بالرواح or فى<br>\
الرواح being redundant,)] and drove her on [by<br>\
a pursuit] like the seeking of him who is making repeated efforts, having been wronged, to obtain his<br>\
due: (O:) المظلوم is an epithet qualifying<br>\
المعقّب, and is in the nom. case agreeable with<br>\
the meaning, (S, O,) because it is put after its<br>\
proper place; (O;) and المعقّب is literally in the<br>\
gen. case, but as to the meaning is an agent: (S,<br>\
O: *) or, accord. to some, المعقّب [here] signifies<br>\
the debtor who puts off the payment of his debt; so<br>\
that المظلوم is an agent and المعقّب is an objective<br>\
complement: (S:) or, as some say, المعقّب signifies<br>\
he who demands the payment of a debt and repeats<br>\
his demand thereof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Also Any one returning [app. to the doing of a thing]. (O.) ―<br>\

also the verb.]<br>\

male after a female. (S, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  And A chamber (بَيْت) in which raisins are put. (K.)<br>\
مُعَاقِبٌ: see عُقِيبٌ, with which it is syn. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] إِبِلٌ مُعَاقِبَةٌ Camels that eat one time, or<br>\
turn, of the [kind of plants called] حَمْض, and<br>\
another of the [kind called] خُلَّة. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\

And نَخْلَةٌ مُعَاقِبَةٌ A palm-tree that bears fruit<br>\
one year, and fails to do so another. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And مُعَاقِبٌ also signifies A revenger of blood: a<br>\
poet, cited by IAar, says,<br>\
وَنَحْنُ قَتَلْنَا بِالمَحَارِقِ فَارِسًا<br>\
جَزَآءَ العُطَاسِ لَا يَمُوتُ المُعَاقِبُ<br>\
meaning [And we slew, in El-Mahárik, (app. the<br>\
name of a place,) a horseman,] taking our bloodrevenge quickly, in the time that elapses between<br>\
a sneeze and the prayer for the sneezer [which is<br>\
usually “ God have mercy on thee ”]: the memory<br>\
of the blood-revenger shall not die. (TA. [It is<br>\
there also said that العقب (app. a mistranscription<br>\
for ↓ المُعَقِّبُ, as may be conjectured from the fact<br>\
that the م after the article is often indistinctly<br>\
written, and inferred on other grounds,) is syn.<br>\
with المُعَاقِبُ as here explained.])<br>\

يَعْقُوبٌ, perfectly decl., because it is an Arabic<br>\

O;) The حَجَل [or partridge]: (K:) or the<br>\
male of the حَجَل; (S, O, Msb;) or of the قَبْج;<br>\
(Lh, Mgh;) but ISd says, I know not whether<br>\
Lh mean by this the حَجَل or the قَطَا or the<br>\
كَرَوَان, nor do I know that the قَبْح is the same<br>\
as the حَجَل: (TA:) and the male of the قَطَا [or<br>\
sand-grouse]: (TA:) pl. يَعَاقِيبُ. (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb.) كَأَنَّكُمْ يَعَاقِيبُ الحَجَلِ, occurring in a<br>\
trad., means [As though ye were the males of<br>\
partridges] in your haste, and your flying into<br>\
destruction: for they are such that, when they<br>\
see the female in the possession of the fowler,<br>\
they throw themselves upon him, so as to fall<br>\
into his hand. (Z, TA in art. ركب.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
accord. to some, (TA,) the pl. also signifies<br>\
Horses: they being thus termed as being likened<br>\
to the يعاقيب of the حَجَل, (O, TA,) because of<br>\
their swiftness: (TA:) so in the phrase رَكْضَ<br>\
اليَعَاقِيبِ [As the running of the horses, or of the<br>\
swift horses]; in a verse of Selámeh Ibn-Jendel:<br>\
(O, TA:) but others say that the meaning [here]<br>\
is, the males of the حَجَل. (TA.) It is said in<br>\
the L that فَرَسٌ يَعْقُوبٌ means A horse that has a<br>\
run after another run [or the power of repeating<br>\
his running] (ذُو عَقْبٍ [or عَقِبٍ]). (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  J has<br>\
cited [in the S] the words of a poet,<br>\
عَالٍ يُقَصِّرُ دُونَهُ اليَعْقُوبُ<br>\
[High, so that the يعقوب falls short of reaching<br>\
it] as an ex. of the last word meaning the male of<br>\
the حَجَل: but IB says that it appears to mean<br>\
in this case the male of the عُقَاب [or eagle]; like<br>\
as اليَرْخُومُ means the male of the رَخَم; and<br>\
اليَحْبُورُ, the male of the حُبَارَى; for the حَجَل is<br>\
not known to have so high a flight: and ElFarezdak describes يَعَاقِيب as congregating with<br>\
vultures over the slain. (TA.)<br>\
اليَعْقُوبِيَّةُ [a coll. gen. n., n. un. يَعْقُوبِىٌّ,] the<br>\
name of A sect of the خَوَارِج, followers of Yaakoob<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Alee El-Koofee. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A sect of<br>\
the Christians; the followers of Yaakoob ElBarádi&#39;ee [or Jacobus Baradæus], who assert<br>\
the unity of the divine and human natures [in the<br>\
person of Christ], and who are the most unbelieving<br>\
and stubborn of the Christians: so says El-Mak-<br>\
reezee, in one of his tracts. (TA.)<br>\
