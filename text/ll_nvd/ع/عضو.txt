precious stone, and the like, shall not be distributed, even though one or more of the inheritors<br>\

regard as an evidence its having for a pl. عِضَوَاتٌ;<br>\
and those who say that it is ه regard as an evidence their saying عَضِيهَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  العِضُونَ as<br>\
meaning السِّحْرُ [i. e. Enchantment, in the CK<br>\
(erroneously) الشَّجَرُ,] is [said to be] pl. of عِضَهٌ<br>\
