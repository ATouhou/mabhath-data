عَامَ فِى المَآءِ, (Mgh, Msb,) aor. يَعُومُ, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. عَوْمٌ, (S, Msb, K,) He swam in the water;<br>\
syn. سَبَحَ: (Mgh:) العَوْمُ signifying السِّبَاحَةُ: (S,<br>\
K:) or, accord. to the author of the “ Iktitáf,”<br>\
the former signifies the coursing along in water<br>\
with immersion of oneself; and the latter, “the<br>\
coursing along upon water without immersion of<br>\
oneself: ” [but see what follows:] or, as some<br>\
say, the former is an act of rational beings, and<br>\
the latter is of irrational; but Bd, on the words<br>\
كُلٌّ فِى فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ [in the Kur xxi. 34], says<br>\
that السِّبَاحَةُ is the act of rational beings. (MF,<br>\
TA.) It is said in a trad., عَلِّمُوا صِبْيانَكُمُ العَوْمَ<br>\
[Teach ye your young boys swimming]. (TA.)<br>\
And one says, العَوْمُ لَا يُنْسَى [Swimming once<br>\
learned will not be forgotten]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
عامت السَّفِينَةُ, (TA,) inf. n. as above, (S, K,) The<br>\
ship coursed along. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عامت<br>\
النُّجُومُ, inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  The stars coursed along.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عامت الِإبِلُ, (TA,) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(S, K,) (tropical:)  The camels marched along, or journeyed,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) in the desert. (TA.) And يَعُمْنَ<br>\
فِى لُجِّ السَّرَابِ (tropical:)  [They course along in the apparently-boundless expanse of the mirage]. (A, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
عوّم السَّفِينَةَ, inf. n. تَعْوِيمٌ, He made the ship<br>\
to swim [or float] in [or upon] the sea. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [J cites immediately after explaining عَامَةٌ in<br>\
relation to a turban,]<br>\
وَعَامَةٍ عَوَّمَهَا فِى الهَامَةِ<br>\
[Many a turn or twist, of a turban, which he<br>\
turned, or twisted, upon the head]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
تَعْوِيمٌ also signifies The putting, or placing,<br>\
reaped corn in handfuls. (S, K.)<br>\
-A3-  See also the<br>\
next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
3<br>\
عاومهُ, (Lh, K, TA,) inf. n. مُعَاوَمَةٌ and<br>\
عِوَامٌ, He hired him, or tock him as a hired man<br>\
or hireling, for the year: (Lh. TA:) or he made<br>\
an engagement, or a contract, with him for work<br>\
or the like, by the year (K:) or you say, عَامَلَهُ<br>\
مُعَاوَمَةً; like as you say, مُشَاهَرَةً; (S, Msb:) the<br>\
former from العَامُ, and the latter from الشَّهْرُ; &amp;c.<br>\
(Msb.) The مُعَاوَمَة that is forbidden is The<br>\
setting the seed-produce of one&#39;s year, (S, K, TA,)<br>\
or the dates of one&#39;s palm-trees, or ones trees, for<br>\
two years, or three, (so in one of my copies of the<br>\
S,) or for what will come forth in the next following year: or, as in the Nh, the selling the fruit of<br>\
one&#39;s palm-trees or of one&#39;s grape-nines or of one&#39;s<br>\
[other] trees for two years, or three, and more<br>\
than that; (TA:) or one&#39;s extending to a man<br>\
the term of a debt that has become due by him and<br>\
his increasing the amount of the debt: (Lh, TA:)<br>\
or one&#39;s adding somewhat to a debt and deferring it<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عاومت السَّخْلَةُ The palm-tree bore<br>\
one year and did not bear another year: (S, K:)<br>\
like سَانَهَت: (As, in K and TA, art. سنه.) as<br>\
also ↓ عُوُّمَت: (K:) and الكَرْمُ ↓ عَوَّمَ, inf. n. تَعْوِيمٌ,<br>\
The grape-vine bore much one year and little<br>\
another, (TA, [See also مُعْوِمٌ; perhaps a mistranscription for مُعَوِّمُ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (i. e. عاومت<br>\
النخلة The palm-tree completed a year [of<br>\
growth]. (Z. TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
الدَّارُ اعامت The house, or dwelling, became<br>\
altered, or changed, and years passed over it;<br>\
like احالت. (TA in art. حول.)<br>\
عَامٌ A year syn. سَنَةٌ: (S, K;) or حَوْلٌ;<br>\
[not سَنَةٌ; for] El. Jawáleekee says, the common<br>\
people do not distinguish between the عام and the<br>\
سنه, making them both to have the same meaning; but the right state of the case is what I have<br>\
been told on the authority of Ahmad Ibn-Yahyà<br>\
[i. e. Th], that the سنه is from any day from<br>\
which one commences a reckoning to the like<br>\
thereof, and the عام is only [a period of] a winter<br>\
and a summer; and it is also said in the T and<br>\
in the Bári that the عام is a حَوْل that makes an<br>\
end of a winter and a summer, so that every عام is<br>\
a سنة, but every سنة is not an عام; for when you<br>\
reckon from a day to the like thereof, that is a<br>\
سنة, and there may be in it half of the summer.<br>\
and half of the winter, whereas the عام is only a<br>\
winter and a summer, without interruption: (Msb,<br>\
MF: *) Er-Rághib mentions a difference in the<br>\
uses of the words عَامٌ and سَنَةٌ [as has been stated<br>\
in art. سنو and سنى: see سَنَةٌ in that art.] and<br>\
Suh says, in the R, that the سنة is longer than<br>\
the عام; that the former is “ a single revolution<br>\
of the sun; ” and that the latter is applied to the<br>\
[twelve] Arabian months [collectively]: it is said<br>\
to be called عام because of the sun&#39;s عَوْم [or coursing] through all of its zodiacal signs [during the<br>\
period which it denotes]: (TA:) its pl. is أَعْوامٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) because the sing. is originally of<br>\
the measure فَعَلٌ [i. e. عَوَمٌ]: (Msb:) it has no<br>\
other pl. than this. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says, لقِيتُهُ<br>\
عَامًا أَوَّلَ [I met him in a former year; generally<br>\
meaning, the year immediately preceding, or, as<br>\
we say, last year]; making the last word imperfectly decl. as being an epithet [and of the measure<br>\
of a verb]: and لَقِتُهُ عَامًا أَوَّلًا [I met him in a<br>\
year before: generally meaning the same as the<br>\
phrase preceding]; making the last word perfectly<br>\
decl. as not being an epithet [but an ad(??)<br>\
and K in art. وأل) or the meaning is, (??)<br>\
year] before this year; even if it be by a number<br>\
of years: (&#39;Alee El-Kári, on the authority of Seer,<br>\
in a marginal note in my MS. copy of the K,<br>\
art. اول:) and one says also, accord. to AZ and<br>\
IAar, لَقَيتُهُ عَامَ الأَوَّلِ; (TA in art. وأل;) or the<br>\
is rarely said; (K and TA in that art.;) or should<br>\
not be said; (ISk, S and TA in that art.;) (??)<br>\
should one say, لَقَيتُهُ عَامَ أَوَّلَ (ISk TA in the<br>\
present art.) And [in like manner] one says,<br>\
ما رَأَيْتُهُ مُذْ عَامٌ أَوَّلُ, putting the last word in the<br>\
nom case as being an epithet, (S and K in art.<br>\
وأل,) as though he said أَوَّلُ مِنْ عَامِنَا [i. e. I have<br>\
not seen him since a year preceding this one year];<br>\
(S in that art.;) and مُذْ عَامٌ أَوَّلَ, putting the last<br>\
word in the accus. case as an adv n., (S and K *<br>\
in that art.,) as though he said مُذْ عامٌ قَبْلَ عَامِنَا<br>\
[since a year before this our year]; (S in that<br>\
art.;) and مُذْعَامًا أَوَّلَ and مُذْ عَامُ الأَوَّلِ are also<br>\
mentioned by different authors (??)in art, منذ)<br>\
And [using the dim. form] one says, لَقِتُهُ ذَاتَ<br>\
↓ العُوَيْمِ i. e. [I met him] in the course of some<br>\
years; like as one says, لَقِيتُهُ ذَاتَ الزُّمَيْنِ, and<br>\
ذَاتَ مَرَّةٍ: (S:) or the meaning is, (some few years<br>\
ago; or] three years ago or more, to ten: (AZ,<br>\
Az, TA:) and it is like the saying, لَقِيتُهُ مُنْذُ<br>\
سُنَيَّاتٍ: the fem. form is used because they mean<br>\
by it مَرَّة وَاحِدَة. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  One says also<br>\
نَاقَةٌ بَازِلُ عَامٍ and بَازِلُ عَامِهَا [A she-camel that<br>\
has passed a year, and her year, after cutting her<br>\
tush], (TA,) and بازِل عَامَيْنِ that has passed two<br>\
years after cutting the tush. (MF and TA in<br>\
art. بزل.)<br>\
-A2-  See also عَامَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A3-  It<br>\
is also said in the K that العَامُ signifies النَّهَارُ: but<br>\
this is a mistake and a mistranscription it is<br>\
العَيَامُ; and its place is art. عيم; as it as mentioned by Az, on the authority of El-Muärrij,<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عَامَةٌ A [kind of float, such as is called] طَوْف<br>\
[q. v.], upon which one embarks on the water;<br>\
(S, K:) accord. to AA, a small مِعْبَر [q. v.] that<br>\
is upon rivers: (Az, TA:) in the M, said to be a<br>\
thing that is made of the branches of trees, and<br>\
the like, upon which one crosses a river, and which<br>\
tosses about upon the water the pl. is عَامَاتٌ and<br>\
عوم [app. عُومٌ, like نُوقٌ pl. of نَاقَةٌ,] and [coll.<br>\
gen. n.] ↓ عَامٌ. (TA.) [See also عَامَّةٌ, voce<br>\
عِمَامَةٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  Also The head of a ruler, or of a rider<br>\
upon a camel, (هَامَةُ رَاكِبٍ,) when it appears to<br>\
thee in the [desert, or plain, called] صَحْرَآء, (K.<br>\
TA,) as he is journeying: (TA:) or it is not<br>\
thus called unless having upon it a turban. (K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A turn, or twist, of a turban. (S,<br>\
K.) [See 2, second sentence.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And A quantity<br>\
of reaped corn put, or placed, in handfuls: pl.<br>\
[or rather coll. gen. n.] ↓ عَامٌ. (S, K.)<br>\
عُومَةٌ A certain insect (دُوَيْبَّة, S, K) that swims<br>\
in the water, resembling a black فَصّ [or stone of<br>\
a ring], smooth and round: (S:) pl. عُوَمٌ. (S,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A species of serpents, in &#39;Omán.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عَامِيٌّ a rel. n., from عَامٌ; (Msb, TA;) A year<br>\
old. (TA in arts. حول and دول, &amp;c.) And<br>\
applied to a plant as meaning A year old, and<br>\
therefore dry. (Msb, TA. *) It is also applied<br>\
to a [vestige, or relic, of a dwelling, such as is<br>\
termed] رَسْم, or طَلَل, as meaning Over which a<br>\
year has passed. (TA.) And it is applied, in a<br>\
trad., as an epithet to the حَنْظَل [or colocynth,<br>\
meaning That is of service in the year of drought,<br>\
or barrenness]; because it is procured, or prepared [as an article of food], in the year of<br>\
drought, or barrenness. (TA.)<br>\
عُوَيْمٌ: see عَامٌ [of which it is the dim.], last<br>\
quarter.<br>\
عَوَّامٌ an intensive epithet from عَامَ فِي المَآءِ;<br>\
(Msb;) A man skilful in swimming. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And (assumed tropical:)  A horse that stretches forth his fore legs well<br>\
in running [like as one does the arms in swimming];<br>\
(S, Z, K, TA;) fleet, or excellent, in his running.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عَائِمٌ [Swimming;] part. n. of عَامَ in the phrase<br>\
عَامَ فِي المَآءِ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] سَفِينٌ عُوَّمٌ<br>\
means عَائِمَةٌ [of which عُوَّمٌ is pl.; i. e. Ships<br>\
coursing along]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  One says سِنُونَ عُوَّمٌ,<br>\
in which the latter word is a corroborative to the<br>\
former; (S, K; *) [app. meaning Tedious, because<br>\
severe, years;] like as one says شُغْلٌ شَاغِلٌ: as<br>\
though pl. of عَائِمٌ; but it is not used alone, because it is not a subst., being only a corroborative: (S:) or, as is said in the M, it should by<br>\
rule be عُومٌ; for [it is pl. of ↓ أَعْوَمُ, and] the pl.<br>\
of أَفْعَلُ is فُعْلٌ; but they pronounce it as above,<br>\
as though the sing. were عَامٌ عَائِمٌ: ISd says, عَامٌ<br>\
↓ أَعْوَمُ is an intensive expression, and I think that<br>\
the meaning is, [A year] that seems long to people<br>\
because of its drought, or barrenness; and similar<br>\
to it is ↓ عَامٌ مُعِيمٌ, mentioned by Lh. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
عَائِمٌ is also [the name of] A certain idol (S, K)<br>\
of the Arabs. (S.)<br>\
عَامٌ أَعْوَمُ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
عِنَبٌ مُعْوِمٌ [perhaps a mistranscription for<br>\
↓ مُعَوِّمٌ, see 3, near the end,] means, as mentioned<br>\
by Az, on the authority of En-Nadr, [A grapevine] that bears one year and does not bear another year. (TA.)<br>\
عَامٌ مُعِيمٌ: see عَائِمٌ, last sentence but one.<br>\
[And see also art. عيم.]<br>\
شَحْمٌ مُعَوِّمٌ Fat of a year after another year.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also مُعْوِمٌ.<br>\
مُسْتَعَامٌ A ship upon the sea. (K.)<br>\
