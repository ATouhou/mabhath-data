copies of the S,) inf. n. عَتَاهَةٌ and عَتَاهِيَةٌ, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) [but see the former of these below,] and<br>\
عَته [app. عَتْهٌ], (Mgh,) or عَتْهٌ and عُتْهٌ and عُتَاهٌ;<br>\
(K;) and (Msb, TA) عَتِهَ, (Msb, TA, and so in<br>\
one of my copies of the S in the place of عُتِهَ, and<br>\
said in the TA to be mentioned by J,) on the<br>\
authority of Akh, and also mentioned by IKtt,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. عَتَهٌ, (Msb, TA,) which is mentioned by A&#39;Obeyd as of the inf. ns. from which<br>\
no verbs are derived, (so in my copies of the S,<br>\
in some copies of which this remark applies to<br>\
تَعَتُّهٌ,) and عَتَاهٌ, with fet-h; (Msb;) He (a man,<br>\
TA) was idiotic, or an idiot, i. e. deficient, or<br>\
wanting, in intellect; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) or one<br>\
who had lost his intellect; (K;) or bereft of his<br>\
intellect, or so in consequence of shame or fear &amp;c.,<br>\
syn. دُهِشَ; (Mgh, Msb, K;) without diabolical<br>\
possession, or madness: (Mgh, Msb:) or, accord.<br>\
to IAar, عُتِهَ signifies he (a man) was, or became,<br>\
possessed, or mad. (Ham p. 680.) [See also<br>\
العَتَهُ, below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  عُتِهَ فِى العِلْمِ He was, or became, addicted, attached, or devoted, to knowledge, or science, and vehemently desirous thereof.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عُتِهَ فِى فُلَانٍ He was, or became,<br>\
addicted to annoying such a one, and mimicking<br>\
his speech. (K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَعَتُّهٌ signifies The being, or becoming, or the<br>\
feigning oneself, possessed, or mad; syn. تَجَنُّنٌ:<br>\
and the being, or becoming, foolish, stupid, unsound in intellect, or deficient therein, and lax, or<br>\
languid; syn. رُعُونَةٌ. (S, K.) [تَعَتَّةَ بِجَارِيَةٍ,<br>\
occurring in this art. in the TA, app. means He<br>\
was, or became, infatuated by love of a girl, or<br>\
young woman.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The feigning ignorance.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The feigning oneself unmindful, or<br>\
heedless. (K.) One says, هُوَ يَتَعَتَّهُ لَكَ عَنْ كَثِيرٍ<br>\
مِمَّا تَأْتِيهِ i. e. He feigns himself unmindful, or<br>\
heedless, [to thee, of much that thou dost, or] of<br>\
thee, in much that thou dost. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And The<br>\

bounds in dress and eating. (K, TA.) One says,<br>\
تَعَتَّهَ فِى كَذَا He affected nicety, or refinement,<br>\
and exceeded the usual bounds, in such a thing.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عَتَهٌ [see 1, first sentence, where it is mentioned<br>\
as an inf. n.]. العَتَهُ is An evil affection, of<br>\
essential origin, necessarily occasioning unsoundness in the intellect; so that the person affected<br>\
therewith becomes confused in intellect; and therefore some of his speech resembles that of the<br>\
intelligent; and some, that of the possessed, or<br>\
mad: it differs from السَّفَهُ; for this does not<br>\
resemble possession, or madness. (KT.)<br>\
عُتَهٌ and ↓ عُتَهِىٌّ (so in the TA as from the K<br>\
[but not found by me in the latter]) and ↓ عُنْتُهٌ<br>\
and ↓ عُنْتُهِىٌّ (so too in the TA, but not as from<br>\
the K, [though I find these two words without<br>\
the two preceding in the copies of the K that I<br>\
have been able to consult,]) A man who greatly<br>\
exceeds the usual bounds in an affair. (K, TA.)<br>\
عُتَهِىٌّ: see what next precedes. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also a<br>\
subst. from التَّعَتُّهُ, of the measure فُعَلِىٌّ: thus in<br>\
the saying of Ru-beh [which is cited in the Ham<br>\
p. 680],<br>\
فِى عُتَهِىِّ اللُّبْسِ وَالتَّقَيُّنِ<br>\
[In affecting cleanliness, or nicety, or refinement,<br>\
or in exceeding the usual bounds, in dress; and in<br>\
self-adornment]. (TA.)<br>\
عَتِيهٌ: see عَاتِهٌ.<br>\
عَتَاهَةٌ a subst. from عُتِهَ [app. in all its senses;<br>\
i. e., meaning Idiocy; &amp;c.; though it might be<br>\
supposed, from the manner in which it is mentioned, to be a subst. from عُتِهَ in the last only of<br>\
the senses above assigned to it]; (K, TA;) as<br>\
also ↓ عَتَاهِيَةٌ: (TA:) or each is an inf. n. of that<br>\
verb [q. v.]. (Mgh, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
عَتَاهِيَةٌ: see عَتَاهَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Foolish, or stupid:<br>\
and so ↓ عُتَاهِيَةٌ; (Akh, S, K, TA;) applied to a<br>\
man. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, in a pl. sense, The erring<br>\
of mankind; and so ↓ عَتَاهَةٌ; (K, TA;) which<br>\
latter signifies also, in a pl. sense, foolish, or<br>\
stupid. (TA.)<br>\
عُتَاهِيَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
عَاتِهٌ A man addicted to annoying another,<br>\
and mimicking his speech; (K, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ عَتِيهٌ: (TA:) pl. [accord. to analogy, of the<br>\
latter, but mentioned in the K as of the former,]<br>\
عُتَهَآءُ. (K, TA.)<br>\
عُنْتُهٌ and see عُتَهٌ.<br>\
عُنْتُهِىٌّ: see عُتَهٌ.<br>\
مُعَتَّهٌ Intelligent, and symmetrical in make:<br>\
and also possessed, or mad, and incongruous in<br>\
make: thus having two contr. significations.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
مَعْتُوهٌ Idiotic, or an idiot, i. e. deficient, or<br>\
wanting, in intellect; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) or<br>\
one who has lost his intellect; (K;) or bereft of<br>\
his intellect, or so in consequence of shame or fear<br>\
&amp;c.; (Mgh, Msb, K;) without diabolical possession, or madness: (Mgh, Msb:) also expl. as<br>\
signifying possessed, or mad; smitten, or afflicted,<br>\
in his intellect. (TA.)<br>\

عَتَا, aor. يَعْتُو, inf. n. عُتُوٌّ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
عُتِىٌّ and عِتِىٌّ, (S, K,) of which عُتُوٌّ is the<br>\
original form, one [i. e. the second] of the two<br>\
dammehs being changed into a kesreh and therefore the و into ى and then the other dammeh<br>\
being assimilated to the kesreh, (S, TA,) He<br>\

inordinate, or exorbitant: (K:) he was excessively, immoderately, or inordinately, proud or<br>\

copy of the S as on the authority of A&#39;Obeyd:) or<br>\
he revolted, recoiled, or was averse, from obedience:<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA:) and ↓ تَعَتَّيْتُ signifies the<br>\
same as عَتَوْتُ; (S, K;) or I [disobeyed, or] did<br>\
not obey; (TA;) and so does عَتَيْتُ; (K, accord.<br>\
to some copies; but in some, عَتِيتُ;) or, accord.<br>\
to J and others, one should not say عَتَيْتُ.<br>\
(TA.) It is said in the Kur [li. 44], فَعَتَوْا عَنْ<br>\
أَمْرِ رَبِّهِمْ (TA) i. e. But they turned with disdain<br>\
from obeying the command of their Lord. (Bd,<br>\

became advanced in age, and in a declining state:<br>\
(S, Msb, * K:) [or he became dried up; as is<br>\
shown by what here follows.] It is said in the<br>\
Kur [xix. 9], accord. to one reading, وَقَدْ بَلَغْتُ<br>\
مِنَ الْكِبَرِ عُتِيًّا, (TA,) from عَتَا It became dried up;<br>\
(Ksh, * Jel;) said of wood, or a branch; as also<br>\
عَسَا: (Ksh:) the meaning here being, [And I<br>\
have reached] the extreme degree of old age:<br>\
(Jel:) or dryness, and hardness, or rigidness, in<br>\
the joints and the bones; like the dry wood or<br>\
branch. (Ksh.)<br>\

عَتِىٌّ: see عَاتٍ.<br>\
عَتَّى a dial. var. of حَتَّى, (S, K,) of the dial.<br>\

signifies the same: (K:) pl. عُتِىٌّ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
originally [عُتُوٌّ,] of the measure فُعُولٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
the [former] و being changed into ى, agreeably<br>\
with a rule which, Mohammad Ibn-Es-Seree<br>\
says, should be observed in a word of this [class<br>\
and] measure when it is a pl., though not<br>\
[generally] when it is an inf. n., (S, TA,) or this<br>\
is pl. of عَتِىٌّ, and the pl. of عَاتٍ is عُتَاةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
[See also أَعْتَآءٌ, below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Advanced [and<br>\
declining] in age: [or dried up: (see 1, last<br>\
sentence but one:)] pl. عُتِىٌّ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
