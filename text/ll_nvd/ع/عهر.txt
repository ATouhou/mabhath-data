to the woman by night for the purpose of adultery<br>\

or he came to her by night for that purpose, or by<br>\

عَاهِرٌ An adulterer or a fornicator; (S, O,<br>\
Msb;) as also ↓ عَهْرٌ [originally an inf. n.]: and<br>\
↓ عُهْيَرَةٌ occurs in a trad. in the same sense, as a<br>\
dim. of عَهْرٌ: or, accord. to ISh, on the authority<br>\
of Ru-beh, عَاهِرٌ signifies one who follows evil,<br>\
whether by committing adultery or fornication, or<br>\
by stealing: (O, TA:) or, as in the L, whether<br>\
by committing adultery or fornication, or by transgressing [in any other manner], or quitting the way<br>\
of truth or justice, or forsaking the command of<br>\
God; أَوْ فَاسِقًا being put in the L in the place of<br>\
او سَارِقًا: (TA:) or any one who does that which<br>\
induces doubt, or suspicion or evil opinion, or doubt<br>\
combined with suspicion or evil opinion: (A, TA:)<br>\
pl. عُهَّارٌ. (Ham p. 131.) It is said in a trad., الوَلَدُ<br>\
لِلْفِرَاشِ وَلِلْعَاهِرِ الحَجَرُ, (S, Mgh, O, &amp;c.,) i. e.,<br>\
The child is for the master of the bed, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA,) meaning, the husband (Msb, TA) of<br>\
the child&#39;s mother, or, if she be a slave, her<br>\
owner; (TA;) and for the adulterer, or fornicator, disappointment; (Msb;) meaning, he<br>\
shall have no right of relationship, (A&#39;Obeyd, S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb,) nor any share in the child: (TA:)<br>\
like the saying لَهُ التُّرَابُ, (A&#39;Obeyd, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb,) which means “ [he has, or shall have,<br>\
or may he have,] disappointment,” (Msb,) or<br>\
“ nothing: ” (Mgh, O, TA:) for some of the<br>\
Arabs used to establish relationship arising from<br>\
adultery or fornication; therefore the law annulled<br>\
this: (Msb:) some, however, explain it agreeably with the apparent [or literal] meaning, and<br>\
for the adulterer, or fornicator, stoning. (Mgh.)<br>\
