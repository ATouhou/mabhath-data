عَنِتَ, [aor.<br>\
عَنَتَ,] inf. n. عَنَتٌ, He fell into a<br>\
difficult, hard, or distressing, case: (S, A, * O,<br>\
TA:) or عَنَتٌ signifies the meeting with difficulty,<br>\
hardship, or distress. (K.) [This is held by some<br>\
to be the primary signification: see عَنَتْ below;<br>\
by the explanations of which it seems to be indicated that the verb has several significations<br>\
that are not expressly assigned to it in the lexicons.] عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ, in the Kur [ix. last<br>\
verse but one], means, accord. to Az [and most<br>\
of the expositors], Grievous unto him is your<br>\
experiencing difficulty, or hardship, or distress:<br>\
or, as some say, the meaning is ↓ مَا أَعْنَتَكُمْ, i. e.,<br>\
what hath brought you into difficulty, or hardship,<br>\
or distress. (TA. [In the S and O, it seems to<br>\
be indicated by the context that مَا عَنِتُّمْ means<br>\
your having sinned.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَنِتَتِ الدَّابَّةُ The beast<br>\
limped, or halted, in consequence of hard, or<br>\
rough, treatment, such as it could not bear. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., أَنْعَلَ دَابَّتَهُ فَعَنِتَتْ He shod<br>\
his beast and it became lame: thus as some<br>\
relate it; as others relate it, فَعَتَبَتْ; but the<br>\
former relation is preferred by Kt. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
عَنِتَ said of a bone, (Az, A, K, TA,) and عَنِتَتْ<br>\
said of an arm or a leg, (Az, TA,) [aor.<br>\
عَنَتَ,]<br>\
inf. n. عَنَتٌ, (TA,) It broke (Az, A, K, TA)<br>\
after its having been set and united: (A, K:)<br>\
[this is said in the Ksh and by Bd, in iv. 30, to<br>\
be the primary signification:] and the former,<br>\
said of a bone, it became weak, and broke. (K, *<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عَنِتَ, (S, O, Msb, TA,) aor.<br>\
عَنَتَ, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. عَنَتٌ, (S, * O, * Msb, K, * TA,) He committed a sin, a crime, or an act of disobedience<br>\
deserving punishment: (S, O, K, * TA: *) or he<br>\
committed sins, crimes, or acts of disobedience<br>\
deserving punishment: (K, * TA:) or he did wrong<br>\
[intentionally or unintentionally]. (Msb.) [And<br>\
particularly He committed fornication, or adultery: see عَنَتٌ below.]<br>\
2<br>\
عنّتهُ, inf. n. تَعْنِيتٌ, He treated him with<br>\
hardness, severity, or rigour, and constrained him<br>\
to do that which was difficult to him to perform;<br>\
(IAmb, O, K, TA;) as also ↓ تعنّتهُ: and afterwards it became applied to signify he destroyed<br>\
him; or caused him to perish: (IAmb, TA:)<br>\
[and ↓ اعنتهُ has both of these significations: for<br>\
it is said that] لَوْ شَآءَ اللّٰهُ لَأَعْنَتَكُمْ, in the Kur<br>\
[ii. 219], means If God had willed, He would<br>\
assuredly have treated you with hardness, &amp;c.,<br>\
and constrained you to do that which would be<br>\
difficult to you to perform: or it may mean,<br>\
would have destroyed you: or, accord. to IAar,<br>\
إِعْنَاتٌ signifies the requiring to do that which is<br>\
not in one&#39;s power. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5.<br>\
4<br>\
اعنتهُ, (inf. n. إِعْنَاتٌ, Mgh,) He caused him<br>\
to fall into difficulty, hardship, or distress; (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, K, TA;) into that which was difficult, hard, or distressing, to him to bear. (Mgh,<br>\
Msb.) See also 1, and 2. ―<br>\
-b2-  He (the rider)<br>\
treated him (i. e. a beast) with hardness, or roughness, such as the latter could not bear, and so<br>\
caused him to limp, or halt. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He (a<br>\
physician) treated him (i. e. a sick man) roughly,<br>\
or without gentleness, and so harmed, or injured,<br>\
him. (A, O. *) ―<br>\
-b4-  He, or it, broke it (i. e. a bone)<br>\
after it had been set and united: (Az, S, A,. O,<br>\
K, TA:) or he (a bone-setter) treated it (i. e. a<br>\
broken bone) roughly, or ungently, so that the<br>\
fracture became worse. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعنّتهُ: see 2. Accord. to AHeyth, (TA,)<br>\
He brought upon him annoyance, molestation,<br>\
harm, or hurt: (Msb, TA:) or he sought to occasion him difficulty, hardship, or distress. (Mgh.)<br>\
And hence, (Mgh,) He asked him respecting a<br>\
thing, desiring by doing so to involve him in confusion, or doubt; (A, Mgh, TA;) as when one<br>\
says to a witness, “Where was this, and when<br>\
was it, and what garment was upon him when<br>\
thou tookest upon thyself to bear witness? ” and<br>\
الشُّهُودَ ↓ يُعَنِّتُ and يَتَعَنَّتُ عَلَى الشُّهُودِ are also<br>\
mentioned; but these require consideration.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
R. Q.1<br>\
عَنْتَتَ, said of the horn of the عَتُود [or<br>\
goat a year old], It rose, or rose high. (O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  عنتت عَنْهُ He turned away from, avoided, or<br>\
shunned, him, or it. (O, K.)<br>\
عَنَتٌ [inf. n. of 1, q. v.: and also expl. as having<br>\
the following meanings:] Difficulty, hardship, or<br>\
distress: (A, IAth, Mgh, Msb, TA:) this is [said<br>\
to be] the primary signification: (Jel in iv. 30:)<br>\
or severe difficulty, or hardship, or distress: (Zj,<br>\
TA:) or the coming of difficulty or hardship or<br>\
distress upon a man. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A state of perdition or destruction. (A, IAth, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A<br>\
bad, an evil, or a corrupt, state: or bad, evil, or<br>\
corrupt, conduct or doing: syn. فَسَادٌ [which has<br>\
both of these meanings; and may here have the<br>\
former meaning as nearly agreeing with what<br>\
precedes it, or the latter meaning as nearly agreeing with what follows it]. (A, IAth, K, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  A sin, a crime, or an act of disobedience<br>\
deserving punishment; (AHeyth, S, A, IAth, O,<br>\
K, TA;) and so ↓ مَعْنَتَةٌ. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  A wrong action<br>\
[intentional or unintentional]; an error; mistake. (IAth, Msb, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  ―<br>\
-b7-  Fornication, or<br>\
adultery: (S, IAth, Mgh, O, Msb, K, TA:) but<br>\
this is a conventional explanation of the lecturers<br>\
of the colleges. (Mgh.) So in the Kur [iv. 30],<br>\
where it is said, ذٰلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِىَ الْعَنَتَ مِنْكُمْ [That<br>\
is for him, among you, who fears the commission<br>\
of fornication]: (S, O, Msb, TA: [and the like<br>\
is said in the Mgh:]) this, says Az, was revealed<br>\
in relation to him who might not have the means<br>\
of taking to wife a free woman; therefore it was<br>\
allowed to him to take to wife a slave: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) or the meaning of العنت here is perdition:<br>\
or perdition in [or by means of] fornication. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  Also Wrongful, unjust, injurious, or tyrannical,<br>\
conduct: and annoyance, molestation, harm, or<br>\
hurt. (AHeyth, TA.) And Distressing, grievous,<br>\
or afflicting, harm, injury, hurt, or mischief.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And accord. to the &#39;Ináyeh, Contention; or contention for superiority in greatness:<br>\
and persistence in opposition, or in vain contention.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عَنِتٌ A bone broken after its having been set<br>\
and united; as also ↓ مُعْنَتٌ. (S, O, K.)<br>\
عَنُوتٌ A hill (أَكَمَةٌ) difficult of ascent; (O,<br>\
Msb, * K;) as also ↓ عُنْتُوتٌ: (O, K:) or high,<br>\
and difficult of ascent. (A.)<br>\
عُنْتُوتٌ: see what next precedes. ―<br>\
-b2-  With the<br>\
article ال, A mountain, (O,) or tapering mountain, (K,) in the صَحْرَآء [or desert]: (O, K:) or,<br>\
accord. to the L, a small mountain tapering into<br>\
[or towards] the sky (جُبَيْلٌ مُسْتَدِقٌّ فِى السَّمَآءِ):<br>\
and it is said to be دون الحرة [app. دُونَ الحَرَّةِ;<br>\
but there seems to be here an omission or a mistranscription; for of the various meanings that<br>\
may be assigned to this phrase, none seems to be<br>\
apposite: I incline to think that العُنْتُوتُ thus<br>\
expl. is the proper name of a particular mountain]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عُنْتُوتٌ signifies also The notch<br>\
in a bow: accord. to Az, (TA,) the عُنْتُوت of the<br>\
bow is the notch into which enters the غَانَة, i. e. the<br>\
ring at the head of the string. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And<br>\
The first, or beginning, or commencement, of anything. (O, K.)<br>\
-A4-  And Dry حَلِىّ, (O, and so<br>\
in the CK, [in my MS. copy of the K حَلْى, and<br>\
thus accord. to the TA, but this is evidently a<br>\
mistake,]) which is a certain plant. (TA.)<br>\
عَانِتٌ an epithet applied to a woman, i. q. عَانِسٌ<br>\
[q. v.]: (O, K:) said to be formed [from the<br>\
latter] by substitution, or a dial. var., or a word<br>\
mispronounced. (MF, TA.)<br>\
مُعْنَتٌ: see عَنِتٌ.<br>\
مَعْنَتَةٌ: see عَنَتٌ. [Its primary signification<br>\
seems to be A cause of difficulty, hardship, or<br>\
distress; &amp;c.]<br>\
جَآءَنِى فُلَانٌ مُتَعَنِّتًا Such a one came to me seeking [to cause] my fall into a wrong action, or an<br>\
error. (S, O, K. *)<br>\
