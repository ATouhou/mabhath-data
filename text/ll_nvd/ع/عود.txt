un., (TA,) and مَعَادٌ, (K, TA,) He, or it, returned to it, (S, A, O, K, * TA,) namely, a thing:<br>\
(TA:) or, accord. to some, the verb is differently<br>\
used with فِى and with other preps.: (MF, TA:)<br>\
[with فى it seems generally to imply some degree<br>\
of continuance, in addition to the simple meaning<br>\
of the verb alone:] one says, عاد الكَلْبُ فِى قَيْئِهِ<br>\
The dog returned to his vomit: (Msb in art. رجع:)<br>\

and ↓ اِعْتَادَ, also, signifies he returned: (KL:)<br>\

لَتَعُودُنَّ فِى مِلَّتِنَا, in the Kur [vii. 86 and xiv. 16],<br>\
means Ye shall assuredly come to our religion;<br>\
for the words relate to the apostle: (O, * and Bd<br>\
in xiv. 16:) or the words relate to the apostle<br>\
and to those who believed with him, the latter<br>\
being made to have a predominant influence upon<br>\
the verb; (Bd in vii. 86 and xiv. 16, and Jel in<br>\
vii. 86;) the meaning being ye shall assuredly<br>\
return to our religion: (Bd * and Jel in vii. 86:)<br>\
or the meaning is, ye shall assuredly enter the<br>\
communion of our religion; the verb here signifying beginning: and the saying, of a poet,<br>\
وَعَادَ الرَّأْسُ مِنِّى كَالثَّغَامِ<br>\
is cited as an ex. [i. e. as meaning And my head<br>\

أَنَّ هٰذَا اللَّبَنَ يَعُودُ قَطِرَانًا [I wish that this milk<br>\

an incomplete [i. e. a non-attributive] verb in the<br>\
sense of كَانَ [He, or it, was], requiring an<br>\
enunciative [generally] on the condition of its<br>\
being preceded by a conjunction, as in the saying<br>\
of Hassán,<br>\
وَلَقَدْ صَبَوْتُ بِهَا وَعَادَ شَبَابُهَا<br>\
غَضًّا وَعَادَ زَمَانُهَا مُسْتَظْرَفًا<br>\
[And I had inclined to silly and youthful conduct<br>\
with her, when her youth was fresh and her time<br>\
of life was deemed comely]; the meaning being<br>\
كَانَ شَبَابُهَا [and كَانَ زَمَانُهَا]. (MF, TA.) [See<br>\
also an ex. in a verse cited voce مَطْمَعَةٌ. But the<br>\
first of the significations mentioned in this art. is<br>\
that which is most common. Hence several<br>\
phrases mentioned below voce عَوْدٌ. And hence<br>\
the phrase يَعُودُ عَلَى كَذَا, inf. n. عَوْدٌ, used by<br>\
grammarians, It refers, or relates, to such a<br>\

عَادِ, indecl., with kesr for its termination, is a<br>\
particle in the sense of إِنَّ, governing an accus.<br>\

verbal proposition and a conjunction; as in the<br>\

thy father was waking, or remaining awake, by<br>\
night]: ―<br>\

-b3-  it also<br>\
denotes an answer, in the sense of a proposition<br>\
rendered negative by means of لم or of ما, only;<br>\
indecl., with kesr for its termination; and this is<br>\
when it is conjoined with a pronoun; as when<br>\
an interrogator says, هَلْ صَلَّيْتَ [Didst thou perform, or hast thou performed, the act of prayer?],<br>\
and thou answerest, عَادِنِنى, meaning Verily I<br>\
(إِنَّنِى) did not perform, or have not performed,<br>\
the act of prayer: ―<br>\
-b4-  and some of the people of<br>\
El-Hijáz suppress the ن in عَادِنِى: both the<br>\
modes are chaste when عَادِ is used in the sense of<br>\
إِنَّ: ―<br>\
-b5-  sometimes, also, it is used by the interrogator and the answerer; the former saying, عَادِ<br>\
خَرَجَ زَيْدٌ [Did Zeyd go forth? or has Zeyd<br>\
gone forth?], and the latter saying, عَادِهِ, meaning Verily he did not go forth, or has not gone<br>\
forth: ―<br>\

O,) and نَاقَتَانِ عَوْدَتَانِ, (As, TA,) and عَنْزٌ عَوْدَةٌ:<br>\
(TA:) or one should not say نَاقَةٌ عَوْدَةٌ, nor نَعْجَةٌ<br>\
عَوْدَةٌ; (Az, TA;) but one says شَاةٌ عَوْدَةٌ: (Az,<br>\
IAth, O:) the pl. of عَوْدٌ is عِوَدَةٌ (As, S, O, K)<br>\
and عِيَدَةٌ (O, K) as some say, but this is anomalous, (O,) of a particular dial., and bad; (Az,<br>\
TA;) and the pl. of عَوْدَةٌ is عوَدٌ. (As, O, TA.)<br>\
It is said in a prov., إِنْ جَرْجَرَ العَوْدُ فَزِدْهُ وِقْرًا [If<br>\

-b3-  And (tropical:)  An old road:<br>\
(S, O, K:) from the same word as an epithet<br>\
applied to a camel. (O.) A poet says, (S, O,)<br>\

trad., as said by Mo&#39;áwiyeh, meaning [Verily<br>\
thou seekest to advance thyself in my favour] by<br>\
an old and remote tie of relationship. (TA.) ―<br>\

sun, in the saying,<br>\
وَتَبِعَ الأَحْمَرَ عَوْدٌ يَرْجُمُهْ<br>\
[And a sun followed the red dawn, driving it<br>\
