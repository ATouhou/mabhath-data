subst., (Msb,) and عَزَازَةٌ, (S, K,) He was, or became, mighty, potent, powerful, or strong; (TA,<br>\
in explanation of عِزٌّ;) and so ↓ تعزّز; or the latter<br>\
signifies he made himself so; he strengthened himself; syn. تَقَوَّى: (Msb:) and the former, he became so after being low, or mean, in condition;<br>\
(AZ, S, A, K;) as also عَزَّ, sec. pers. عَزِرْتَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَزَ3َ: (Msb:) he was, or became, high, or elevated, in rank, or condition, or state; noble,<br>\
honourable, glorious, or illustrious; (S, * A, * K, *<br>\
TK; and TA in explanation of عِزٌّ;) as also<br>\
↓ تعزّز. (S, * K, * TK.) [عَزَّ وَجَلَّ, referring to the<br>\
name of God expressed or understood, is a phrase<br>\
of frequent occurrence, meaning, To Him, or to<br>\
Whom, belong might and majesty, or glory and<br>\
greatness.] ―<br>\
-b2-  You also say, عَزَزْتُ عَلَيْهِ, (S, O,<br>\
K,) aor.<br>\
عَزِ3َ; (O, K,) meaning, كَرُمْتُ عَلَيْهِ, (S,<br>\
O, K, *) i. e., I exceeded him in nobleness, or<br>\
generosity. (TK.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَزَّ, [aor.<br>\
عَزِ3َ, inf. n. عِزٌّ<br>\
and عِزَّةٌ and app. عَزَازَةٌ also,] He magnified, or<br>\
exalted, himself: (TA:) (assumed tropical:)  he was disdainful,<br>\
scornful, or indignant, in a blamable manner.<br>\
(TA, in explanation of عِزَّةٌ; q. v. infrà.) [See<br>\
also 5.] ―<br>\
-b4-  He resisted, or withstood: (TA, in<br>\
explanation of عِزٌّ:) he was indomitable, invincible; not to be overcome. (B and TA, in explanation of عِزَّةٌ, q. v. infrà.) And عَزَّ الشَّىْءُ, aor.<br>\
عَزِ3َ,<br>\
The thing was, or became, [difficult, or hard; as<br>\
also ↓ اِعْتَزَّ, (occurring in the TA, coupled with<br>\
تَعَسَّرَ, in an explanation of مَنُعَ, in art. منع,) and<br>\
↓ تعزّز: and] impossible, insuperable, or unattainable: or so, as Es-Sarakustee says, ↓ تعزّز.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And عَزَّ, (S, O, K,) aor.<br>\
عَزِ3َ, inf. n. عِزٌّ<br>\
and عِزَّةٌ and عَزَازَةٌ, (S, O,) It (a thing, S, O, K,<br>\
meaning anything, TA) was, or became, rare,<br>\
scarce, hardly to be found. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [And<br>\
hence, He, or it, was, or became, dear, highly<br>\
esteemed, or greatly valued..] ―<br>\
-b7-  عَزَّ عَلَىَّ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ<br>\
كَذَا, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
عَزِ3َ (Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K) and<br>\
عَزَ3َ (Fr, Mgh, O, K,) [the second pers.<br>\
of the pret. being عَزَزْتَ and عَزِزْتَ,] the latter<br>\
aor. the more chaste, (O,) means Thy doing so<br>\
distressed, or hath distressed, or afflicted, me;<br>\
or, emphatically, distresses, or afflicts, me; syn.<br>\
اِشْتَدَّ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, TA,) and حَقَّ, (S,<br>\
O, K, TA,) and شَقَّ: (TA:) a phrase [often,<br>\
but not always,] alluding to a loathing of the<br>\
action, or indignation thereat. (Msb.) In like<br>\
manner also you say, عَزَّ عَلَىَّ كَذَا Such a thing<br>\
distressed, or afflicted, me. (S.) And عَزَّ عَلَىَّ أَنْ<br>\
أَسُوْءَكَ It distressed, or afflicted, me to displease thee.<br>\
(A.) And عَزَّ مَا أَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ, like حَقَّ أَنَّكَ ذَاهِبٌ<br>\
[or حَقَّ مَا انّك ذاهب, meaning It is distressing<br>\
that thou art going away]. (TA.) And one<br>\
says to a man, Dost thou love me? and he replies, لَعَزَّ مَا, i. e., لَشَدَّ مَا, (A, O, K,) and لَحَقَّ مَا,<br>\
(A, TA,) meaning It distresses me, what thou<br>\
sayest; or it has distressed me. (TK.) You say<br>\
also, بِمَا أَصَابَكَ ↓ أُعْزِزْتُ I was, or am, distressed<br>\
by what befell, or hath befallen, thee. (S, O, K.)<br>\
And عَلَىَّ بِمَا أُصِبْتَ بِهِ ↓ أَعْزِزْ That by which thou<br>\
hast been afflicted distresses me: (S, O:) [or how<br>\
doth it distress me!] so in a trad. of &#39;Alee; when<br>\
he beheld Talhah slain, he said, عَلَىَّ ↓ أَعْزِزْ<br>\
أَبَا مُحَمَّدٍ أَنْ أَرَاكَ مُجَدَّلًا تَحْتَ نُجُومِ السَّمَآءِ [It<br>\
distresses me, or how doth it distress me! O Aboo-Mohammad, that I see thee prostrated upon the<br>\
ground beneath the stars of heaven]. (TA.) [A<br>\
similar ex. is given in the A; without بِ prefixed<br>\
to أَنْ.]<br>\
-A2-  عَزَّ also signifies He was, or became,<br>\
weak: thus having two contr. meanings. (Msb.)<br>\
-A3-  عَزَّهُ, aor.<br>\
عَزُ3َ, (S, A, O, K,) inf. n. عَزٌّ, (S, O,<br>\
TA,) He overcame him, or conquered him: (S,<br>\
A, O:) he overcame him in argumentative contest; (K, * TA;) as also ↓ عَزْعَزَهُ, (K,) inf. n. عَزْعَزَةٌ;<br>\
(TA;) and so عَزَّهُ فِى الخِطَابِ: (Jel in xxxviii.<br>\
22, and TA:) or this last signifies he became<br>\
stronger than he therein; (TA;) or he strove with<br>\
him to overcome therein; as also فِيهِ ↓ عازّهُ, (S,<br>\
K,) inf. n. مُعَازَّةٌ: (O, TA:) in the Kur xxxviii.<br>\
22, some read عَزَّنِى; and others, ↓ عَازَّنِى: and<br>\
you say, فَعَزَزْتُهُ ↓ عَازَّنِى, meaning, he strove with<br>\
me to overcome, and I overcame him: and مُعَازَّةٌ<br>\
signifies the contending together in argument:<br>\
(TA:) you say also of a horse, فَارِسَهُ ↓ اعتزّ [he<br>\
overcame his rider, or gained the mastery over<br>\
him]. (S and K in art. جمع.) It is said in a<br>\
prov., (S,) مَنْ عَزَّ بَزَّ He who overcomes takes the<br>\
spoil. (S, A, O, K.) And in another prov., (S,)<br>\
إِذَا عَزَّ أَخُوكَ فَهُنْ (Th, S, O, K) When thy brother<br>\
overcomes thee, and thou art not equal to him<br>\
(لَمْ تُقَاومْهُ) be thou gentle to him: (Az, O, K,<br>\
TA:) or when thy brother magnifies and exalts<br>\
himself against thee, abase thyself: (Th, TA:)<br>\
or, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák, what Th says is a<br>\
mistake; the right reading being فَهِنْ, with kesr,<br>\
and the meaning, when thy brother is hard, or<br>\
severe, to thee, treat thou him with gentleness, or<br>\
blandishment; not فَهُنْ, with damm, which is<br>\
from الهَوَانُ: but ISd approves and justifies the<br>\
reading given by Th. (TA.) [See also 10.]<br>\
-A4-<br>\
عَزَّهُ. aor.<br>\
عَزُ3َ, inf. n. عَزٌّ, also signifies the same as<br>\

↓ تعزّزت: (S, K:) or عَزُزَتْ, [which is of a very<br>\
uncommon form, (see دَمَّ, last sentence,)] she (a ewe,<br>\
or goat,) became scant in her milk. (IKh, TA in<br>\
art. لب.)<br>\
2<br>\
عزّزهُ, (inf. n. تَعْزِيزٌ, TA,) He rendered him<br>\
mighty, potent, powerful, or strong; he strengthened him; (S, Msb, TA;) بِآخَرَ by, or by means<br>\
of, another; (Msb;) as also ↓ عَزَّهُ, (S, Msb, TA,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَزُ3َ, inf. n. عَزٌّ; (Msb;) and ↓ اعزّهُ: (O, TA:)<br>\
the agent is God, (S, TA,) and a man: (Msb, TA:)<br>\
He (God, S, TA) rendered him mighty, potent,<br>\
powerful, or strong, after he had been low, or mean,<br>\
in condition; (K, TA;) as also ↓ اعزّهُ [which is<br>\
the more common in this sense, and as signifying<br>\
He rendered him high, or elevated, in rank or condition or state, or noble, honourable, glorious, or<br>\
illustrious]. (S, K, TA.) In the Kur [xxxvi. 13],<br>\
some read, فَعَزَّزْنَا بِثَالِثٍ; (S, TA;) and others,<br>\
بثالث ↓ فَعَزَزْنَا; meaning And then we strengthened<br>\

فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِى اللّٰهُ بِقَوْمٍ يُحِبُّهُمْ وَيُحِبُّونَهُ أَذِلَّةٍ عَلَى<br>\
المُؤْمِنِينَ أَعِزَّةٍ عَلَى الْكَافِرِينَ, meaning, [God will<br>\

-b9-  عَزِيزٌ also signifies Severe, difficult,<br>\
distressing, or grievous; (see an ex. voce عَنِتَ;)<br>\
and so ↓ أَعَزُّ, fem. عَزَّآءُ:] you say, سَنَةٌ عَزَّآءُ A<br>\
severe year: (S, O, K:) and مَنْ حَسُنَ مِنْهُ العَزَآءُ<br>\
هَآنَتْ عَلَيْهِ العَزَّآءُ [He whose patient endurance of<br>\
a loss is of a good description, what is difficult, or<br>\
distressing, becomes easy to him]. (A.)<br>\

العَزِيزِ [The small tubercles that compose the root<br>\
of the cyperus esculentus, which have a sweet and<br>\
pleasant taste, and which women eat with the view<br>\

itself: both are thus called in the present day].<br>\
(TA voce سُقَّيْطٌ, &amp;c.)<br>\
عَزَازَةٌ A small water-course of a valley, shorter<br>\
than a مِذْنَب [q. v.]. (AA, TA.) ―<br>\

عَزِيزَةٌ [fem. of عَزِيزٌ, q. v. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also] An eagle:<br>\
so in a verse of Aboo-Kebeer El-Hudhalee: but<br>\
as some relate that verse, it is عَزِيبَة, (K, TA,)<br>\
i. e. “ that has gone far from the seeker: ” (TA:)<br>\
or غَرِيبَة, (TA, and thus in the CK,) expl. by Skr<br>\
as meaning “ black ” (سَوْدَآء) [as though for غِرْبِيبَة,<br>\
fem. of غِربِيب: but the word سَوْدَآء immediately<br>\
follows it in that verse]. (TA.)<br>\
عُزَيْزَى and عُزَيْزَآءُ The extremity of the hip, or<br>\
haunch, of a horse: (S, O, K, TA:) or the part<br>\
between the root of the tail and the جَاعِرَة [q. v.];<br>\
(TA as from the K [in which I do not find it]):<br>\
or the former, a sinew inserted in the rectum, extending to the hip, or haunch: (Aboo-Málik, TA:)<br>\
dual of the former عُزَيْزَيَانِ, and of the latter<br>\
عُزَيْزَاوَانِ. (S, O, TA.)<br>\
عُزَّى: see أَعَزُّ, in four places: and عَزِيزٌ.<br>\
عَزَّآءُ [fem. of أَعَزُّ, q. v., last sentence: ―<br>\
-b2-  and]<br>\
i. q. مَعْزُوزَةٌ, q. v. (TA.)<br>\
أَعَزُّ [More, and most, mighty, potent, powerful,<br>\
or strong: &amp;c.: see عَزِيزٌ, of which it is the comparative and superlative form: and see an ex.<br>\
voce اَلْ (p. 75): and another in a verse cited in<br>\
art. صب, conj. 6]. It is related in a trad. of<br>\
Aboo-Bekr, that he said to &#39;Áïsheh, إِنَّ أَحَبَّ<br>\
النَّاسِ إِلَىَّ غَنًى أَنْتِ وَأَعَزُّهُمْ فَقْرًا أَنْتِ, meaning.<br>\
Verily the one of mankind whose richness is most<br>\
pleasing to me art thou; and the one of them<br>\
whose poverty is most distressing to me art thou.<br>\
(Mgh.) The fem. of أَعَزُّ [as a noun of excess] is<br>\
↓ عُزَّى: (S, ISd, O, K;) like as فُضْلَى is of<br>\
أَفْضَلُ. (ISd.) [But see what follows.] ―<br>\
-b2-  ↓ العُزَّى<br>\
was the name of A certain idol, (S, O, K,) belonging to Kureysh and Benoo-Kináneh: (S, O,<br>\
TA:) or a certain gum-acacia-tree, (سَمُرَةٌ,) which<br>\
the tribe of Ghatafán (S, O, K) the son of Saad<br>\
the son of Keys-&#39;Eilán (TA) used to worship; (S,<br>\
O, K;) the first who took it as an object of worship was Dhálim the son of As&#39; ad; above Dhát-<br>\
&#39;Irk, nine miles towards El-Bustán, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
at [the valley called] En-Nakhleh Esh-Shámeeyeh,<br>\
(O, TA,) near Mekkeh; or, as some say, at Et-<br>\
Táïf: (TA:) he, (K,) Dhálim, (O,) or they, (S,)<br>\
built over it a house, (S, O, K) and named it<br>\
بُسّ, (O, K,) accord. to Ibn-El-Kelbee; or, accord.<br>\
to others, بُسَّآء; (TA;) and they appointed to it<br>\
ministers, (S, TA,) like those of the Kaabeh;<br>\
(TA;) and they used to hear in it a voice: (O,<br>\
K, TA:) but Mohammad sent to it Khálid Ibn-El-Weleed, (S, O, K,) in the year of the conquest<br>\
[of Mekkeh], (O, TA,) and he demolished the<br>\
house, (S, K,) and slew the [chief] minister,<br>\
(TA,) and burned the gum-acacia-tree: (S, O,<br>\
K:) or, as is related on the authority of I&#39;Ab, a<br>\
certain she-devil, who used to come to three gumacacia-trees (سَمُرَات) in Batn-Nakhleh, against<br>\
whom Mohammad, when he conquered Mekkeh,<br>\
sent Khálid Ibn-El-Weleed; and he cut down<br>\
the trees, and slew her and her minister. (TA.)<br>\
A poet says,<br>\
أَمَا وَدِمَآءٍ مَائِرَاتٍ تَخَالُهَا<br>\
عَلَى قُنَّةِ العُزَّى وَبِالنَّسْرِ عَنْدَمَا<br>\
[Verily, or now surely, by bloods flowing, and<br>\
running hither and thither, which thou wouldst<br>\
think to be dragon&#39;s-blood, upon the mountain-top<br>\
of El-&#39; Ozzà, and by En-Nesr]. (S.) ISd says,<br>\
I hold ↓ العُزَّى to be fem. of الأَعَزُّ; and if so, the<br>\
ال in the former is not redundant, but is like the<br>\
ال in الحَارِثُ and العَبَّاسُ: but properly it should<br>\
be redundant, because we have not heard العُزَّى<br>\
as an epithet [of excess] like as we have heard<br>\
الصُّغْرَى and الكُبْرَى. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ↓ عُزَّى is<br>\
[however] used in the sense of عَزِيزَةٌ: (K, TA:)<br>\
and أَعَزُّ [fem. عَزَّآءُ] is also syn. with عَزِيزٌ, which<br>\
see in four places. (S, K.)<br>\
المُعِزُّ, as a name of God, He who giveth عِزّ [or<br>\
might, &amp;c.] to whomsoever He will, of his servants.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَعَزَّةٌ [accord. to analogy signifies A cause, or<br>\
means, of عِزّ i. e. might, &amp;c.]: see ظَفَارِ.<br>\
إِنَّكُمْ مُعَزَّزٌ بِكُمْ Verily ye are treated with hardness, severity, or rigour; not with indulgence. (S,<br>\
O, TA.) From a trad. of Ibn-&#39;Omar. (O, TA.)<br>\
فُلَانٌ مِعْزَازٌ المَرَضِ Such a one is in a severe<br>\
state of disease. (S, O, K.)<br>\
مَعْزُوزَةٌ, applied to land, or ground, (أَرْضٌ, S, O,)<br>\
Hard, or firm; syn. شَدِيدَةٌ. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And, so applied, Rained upon (O, K, TA) by<br>\
rain such as is termed عِزّ, and rendered compact,<br>\
or coherent, and hard; as also ↓ عَزَازَةٌ and ↓ عَزَّآءُ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُعْتَزٌّ is syn. with مُسْتَعِزٌّ. (TA.) You say, أَنَا<br>\
مُعْتَزٌّ بِبَنِى فُلَانٍ and بِهِمْ ↓ مُسْتَعِزٌّ [I reckon myself<br>\
strong by means of the sons of such a one]. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  فَرَسٌ مُعْتَزَّةٌ A mare having thick and strong<br>\
flesh. (TA.)<br>\
