عَشِبَ المَوْضِعُ and<br>\
عَشِبَتِ الأَرْضُ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
عَشِبَ said of bread, (Yaakoob, TA,) It was, or<br>\
became, dry, (Yaakoob, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عشب,<br>\
[so in the TA, app. عَشُبَ,] inf. n. عَشَابَةٌ and<br>\
عُشُوبَةٌ, said of a man, He became dry, or tough,<br>\
by reason of leanness. (Yaakoob, TA.)<br>\

عَشَّبَ see what next follows.<br>\
4<br>\
اعشب المَوْضِعُ; and ↓ عَشِبَ, aor.<br>\
عَشَبَ, inf. n.<br>\
عَشَبٌ; The place produced its [herbs, or herbage,<br>\
of the kind termed] عُشْب: (Msb:) and in like<br>\
manner, (Msb,) اعشبت الأَرْضُ, (S, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
and ↓ عَشِبَت, (Msb,) and thus in a copy of the<br>\
K, [and in my MS. copy,] but in another copy,<br>\
[and in the CK,] ↓ عشّبت, (TA,) The land produced عُشْب. (S, O, K.) [See also 12. After the<br>\
mention of بَلَدٌ عَاشِبٌ in the S and O, it is said<br>\
in the former that for the verb one does not say<br>\
otherwise than اعشبت الأَرْضُ, and in the latter<br>\
that one does not say عَشَبَ البَلَدُ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And اعشب<br>\
القَوْمُ The people, or party, lighted on, or found,<br>\
عُشْب; (S, O, K;) as also القوم ↓ اِعْشَوْشَبَ [but<br>\
probably in an intensive sense]. (K.) One says<br>\
to him who is sent to seek for herbage, أَعْشَبْتَ<br>\
اِنْزِلْ [Thou hast found fresh herbage: alight].<br>\
(O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 5.<br>\
-A2-  سَأَلْتُهُ فَأَعْشَبَنِى [I asked<br>\
him and] he gave me an old she-camel, (S, O, K,<br>\
TA,) i. e. what is termed عَشَبَة. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعشّبت الإِبِلُ The camels fed upon [herbs, or<br>\
herbage, of the kind termed] عُشْب; and [accord.<br>\
to the TA as a distinct meaning] became fat (K,<br>\
TA) therefrom; (TA;) as also ↓ أَعْشَبَت accord.<br>\
to the K, but this latter is wrong, being correctly<br>\
↓ اعتشبت, as in the parent-lexicons. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِعْتَشَبَ see what next precedes.<br>\
12<br>\
اِعْشَوْشَبَتِ الأَرْضُ The land produced abundance, or much, of [herbs, or herbage, of the kind<br>\
termed] عُشْب; this verb having an intensive signification, like اخشوشن [q. v.]. (S, O, TA.) [It<br>\
is erroneously mentioned in the K as syn. with<br>\
أَعْشَبَت.] ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 4.<br>\
عُشْبٌ [a coll. gen. n.], n. un. with ة; (TA;)<br>\
Fresh, green, juicy, soft, or tender, herbs or herbage, (S, A, O, Msb, K,) in the first part of the<br>\
[season called] رَبِيع [i. e. رَبِيعُ الكَلَأَ, which begins<br>\
in January and ends in March, O. S.]: (Msb:) not<br>\
termed حَشِيشٌ until drying up: (S, O:) or, in the<br>\
opinion of the generality of the lexicologists,<br>\
عُشْبٌ is applied to such as is fresh and to such as<br>\
is dry: (ISd, TA voce حَشِيشٌ:) or the first, or<br>\
earliest, of herbage, (سَرَعَانُ الكَلَأِ,) in the رَبِيع, that<br>\
[afterwards] dries up, and does not remain; the<br>\
term كَلَأٌ being applied by the Arabs to عُشْب and<br>\
to other kinds: and عُشْبٌ is applied to fresh, green,<br>\
juicy, soft, or tender, herbs or leguminous plants, of<br>\
the desert, that come forth in the رَبِيع: and under<br>\
this term are included those that are hard and<br>\
thick, which are termed the ذُكُور thereof; as<br>\
well as to those that are slender and soft, which<br>\
are termed the أَحْرَار thereof: or, accord. to AHn,<br>\
whatever is destroyed by winter, and grows again<br>\
from the stocks, or roots, thereof, or the seed: he<br>\
says also that it is applied to such [herbage] as is<br>\
uninterrupted; as opposed to تَعَاشِيبُ: or, accord.<br>\
to Th, it is applied to the mature; as so opposed.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عُشْبَةُ الدَّارِ [The green herb of the dwelling] means that which grows in the دِمْنَة [or patch<br>\
of ground which people have blackened by their<br>\
cooking and where their cattle have staled and<br>\
dunged] of the dwelling, surrounded by fresh, or<br>\
green, herbs, in a white [or clean] part of the<br>\
ground, and good soil: and hence, (tropical:)  The هَجِينَة<br>\
[or woman whose father is a free man, or an<br>\
Arab, and her mother a slave]; an appellation<br>\
like خَضْرَآءُ الوَضَرِ [app. lit. meaning “ The green<br>\
herb that grows in the place where the water with<br>\
which skins have been washed, or the like, is<br>\
poured out: ” but IbrD thinks that it may be a<br>\
mistranscription for خَضْرَآءُ الدِّمَنِ]. (TA.) ―<br>\

[عُشْبُ الذِّئْبِ is Eyptian toad-flax; antirrhinum<br>\
