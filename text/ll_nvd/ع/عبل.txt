عَبُلَ,] (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. عَبَالَةٌ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb,) He, or it, was, or became, large,<br>\
big, bulky, or thick; (S, O, Msb, K;) as also<br>\

عَبُلَ, (K,) inf. n. عُبُولٌ; (TK;) and عَبِلَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَبَلَ, (K,) inf. n. عَبَلٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَبَلَهُ, (Az,<br>\

عَبِلَ, as in other senses of the<br>\
trans. verb,] inf. n. عَبْلٌ, (Az, TA,) He cut it,<br>\
or cut it off, (Az, O, * K,) so as to extirpate it:<br>\
this is the primary signification [of the trans.<br>\
verb]. (Az, TA.) ↓ عَبَلَتْهُ عَبُولُ, (O, K, [but<br>\
in the copies of the K erroneously written عَبُولٌ,])<br>\
said of a man when he has died, (O,) means, (K,)<br>\
or is like, (O,) شَعَبَتْهُ شَعُوبُ [Death separated<br>\
him from his companions; or, accord. to the<br>\
primary signification of the verb, death cut him<br>\
off, or extirpated him]; (O;) or اِشْتَعَبَتْهُ شَعُوبٌ.<br>\
(K. [But correctly as in the O.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَبَلَ الشَّجَرَةَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَبِلَ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. عَبْلٌ, (S, O,) He removed the leaves from the tree; (S, O, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ عَبَّلَهَا. (CK: but not in my MS. copy of<br>\
the K, nor in the TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَبَلَهُ, (IAar, O,<br>\
K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,) He repelled<br>\
it; (IAar, O, K;) namely, a thing. (K.) [See<br>\
also the pass. part. n., below.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And He, or it,<br>\
hindered, prevented, impeded, or withheld, him;<br>\
(O, K, TA;) and diverted him by occupying him<br>\
otherwise. (TA.) One says, مَا عَبَلَكَ i. e. What<br>\
diverted thee by occupying thee otherwise? and<br>\
hindered thee, &amp;c.? (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And عَبَلْتُ الحَبْلَ,<br>\
inf. n. عَبْلٌ, I twisted the rope. (S, O.)<br>\
-A3-  عَبَلْتُ<br>\

K.)<br>\
-A5-  عبل الشَّجَرُ [app. عَبَلَ, but perhaps a mistranscription for أَعْبَلَ, q. v.,] The trees put forth<br>\
their leaves: on the authority of Az. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
عَبَّلَ see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
اعبل He, or it, was, or became, thick and<br>\
white: (K:) originally used in relation to the fore<br>\
arms. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اعبل الشَّجَرُ The trees put forth<br>\
their [leaves termed] عَبَل: and the trees dropped<br>\
their leaves: thus having two contr. significations: (O, K: *) or اعبل الأَرْطَى the [trees called]<br>\
ارطى became in the state in which their هَدَب [or<br>\
عَبَل (q. v.)] were thick, in the hot season, and<br>\
red, and fit to be used for tanning therewith:<br>\
and, accord. to As, اعبلت الشَّجَرَةُ signifies the<br>\
tree dropped its leaves: (S:) accord. to En-Nadr,<br>\
اعبلت الأَرْطَاةُ signifies the ارطاة put forth its leaves:<br>\
and also, dropped its leaves: (Az, TA:) and ISd<br>\
mentions, on the authority of AHn, اعبل الشَّجَرُ<br>\
as meaning the trees put forth their fruit; but he<br>\
says, “I have not found this to be known. ”<br>\
(TA.) [See also 1, last sentence.]<br>\
عَبْلٌ Large, big, bulky, or thick; (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ عَبِلٌ: (K:) fem. of the former with ة:<br>\
and pl. [masc.] عِبَالٌ, (S, O, K, TA,) like ضِخَامٌ<br>\
[pl. of the syn. ضَخْمٌ]: and the pl. of عَبْلَةٌ is<br>\
عَبْلَاتٌ, (S, O, TA,) [with the ب quiescent,] because it is an epithet. (TA.) It is applied in<br>\
this sense to anything. (K.) Thus, in a trad.,<br>\
it is applied to a man. (TA.) And one says<br>\
رَجُلٌ عَبْلُ الذِّرَاعَيْنِ A man large, &amp;c., in the fore<br>\
arms. (S, O, Msb. *) And فَرَسٌ عَبْلٌ الشَّوَى A<br>\
horse thick in the legs. (S, O.) And اِمْرَأَةٌ عَبْلَةٌ<br>\
A woman complete, or perfect, in make or formation. (S, O, Msb.) And ↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ عَبِيلَةٌ A<br>\
large, big, bulky, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,) or thick,<br>\
woman. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K. *) And ↓ عَابِلٌ applied to a boy, or young man, signifies Fat: and<br>\
[so] ↓ عَبُولٌ applied to a woman: pl. of both<br>\
عُبُلٌ. (TA.)<br>\
عَبَلٌ i. q. هَدَبٌ i. e. (S, O) Any leaves that are<br>\
[as though they were] twisted, (S, O, K,) not expanded, (K,) [generally meaning slender sprigs,<br>\
like strings, garnished with minute, amplexicaul,<br>\
appressed, acute leaves, overlying one another like<br>\
the scales of a fish,] such as those of the طَرْفَآء (S,<br>\
O, K) and of the أَرْطَى and of the أَثْل and the<br>\
like of these: (S, O:) and, (K,) as some say,<br>\
(TA,) the fruit of the ارطى: (K, TA:) and,<br>\
(K,) as some say, (TA,) the هَدَب thereof, when<br>\
they have become thick, (K, TA,) in the hot season, and red, (TA,) and fit to be used for tanning therewith: or slender leaves: (K, TA:) or<br>\
the like of leaves, but not [what are commonly<br>\
called] leaves: (TA:) or such as are falling<br>\
thereof; (K, TA;) i. e., of leaves: (TA:) and<br>\
[in the CK “ or ”] such as are coming forth (K,<br>\
TA) thereof: (TA:) thus having two contr.<br>\
significations. (K, TA.)<br>\
عَبِلٌ: see عَبْلٌ, first sentence.<br>\
عَبَالٌ The mountain-rose (وَرْد جَبَلِىّ [one of the<br>\
appellations now applied to the eglantine, or sweet<br>\
brier, more commonly called the نِسْرِين]): (S,<br>\
Msb, K:) AHn says, and Arab of the desert informed me that the عَبَال is the rose of the mountain (وَرْدُ الجَبَلِ), of which is the white, and the<br>\
red, and the yellow; (O, TA;) having a goodly<br>\
hip (دَلِيك [thus correctly written in the O, but<br>\
afterwards altered to دِلِّيك,]) in size and redness<br>\
like the full-grown, unripe date, which, when it<br>\
becomes ripe, is sweet, and delicious, like the fresh<br>\
ripe date, and is sent from one to another as a<br>\
present: (O:) [n. un. with ة:] the عَبَالَة, he says,<br>\
has short, curved thorns, its rose is sweet-scented,<br>\
and it grows so as to compose thickets, (O, TA,)<br>\
and is depastured, (O,) and it becomes thick,<br>\
(K,) and staves (O, K) thick and good, (O,) or<br>\
thick and strong, (TA,) are cut from it: (O, K,<br>\
TA:) the staff of Moses is said to have been<br>\
from it: (K, TA:) or, as AHn says, the people<br>\
assert that the staff of Moses was an عَبَالَة. (O.)<br>\
عَبُولٌ: see عَبْلٌ, last sentence.<br>\
-A2-  عَبُولُ [said in<br>\
the K to be like صَبُور, but it is imperfectly decl.,<br>\
as a fem. proper name,] Death; or the decree of<br>\
death; syn. المَنِيَّةُ. (K.) See 1, third sentence:<br>\
and see also عَابِلٌ.<br>\
عَبَالَة: see عَبَالَّتَهُ.<br>\
اِمْرَأَةٌ عَبِيلَةٌ: see عَبْلٌ.<br>\
أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ عَبَالَّتَهُ, with teshdeed to the ل, (S,<br>\
O, K,) [of a rare form, like حَمَارَّةٌ, q. v.,] and<br>\
↓ عَبَالَتَهُ, without teshdeed, (Lh, K,) He threw<br>\
upon him his weight. (S, O, K.)<br>\
عَابِلٌ: see عَبْلٌ, last sentence.<br>\
-A2-  ↓ عَابِلَتِى عَبُولُ<br>\
is a saying of the Arabs like their saying شَاجِنَتِى<br>\
شَجُونُ [i. e., app., meaning My separater from<br>\
my companions is death, or shall be death alone].<br>\
(L in art. شجن: see شَجُونُ.)<br>\
عَبَنْبَلٌ Great, (AA, O, K, TA,) big, or bulky,<br>\
(TA,) and strong. (K, TA.)<br>\
أَعْبَلُ A mountain of which the stones are white:<br>\
(K:) or rough, rugged, or thick, stone, which<br>\
may be red, and may be white, and may be black,<br>\
(ISh, O, K, *) and may be a rugged, high mountain: (ISh, O:) expl. in the S as meaning<br>\
white stones; but correctly, as IB says, white<br>\
stone: and أَعْبِلَةٌ is an irreg. pl. thereof. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And [the fem.] عَبْلَآءُ signifies A rock: (K,<br>\
TA: [in the CK, أَو should be inserted after<br>\
الصَّخْرَةُ:]) or a white rock: (Th, S, K, TA:) or<br>\
a white, hard rock: (TA:) pl. عِبَالٌ, like بِطَاحٌ<br>\
pl. of بَطْحَآءُ. (S, TA.) And A white [hill, or<br>\
eminence such as is termed] أَكَمَة. (TA.) And<br>\
A narrow strip (طَرِيدَةٌ) in the midst of a land,<br>\
the stones of which are white, resembling the stones<br>\
from which fire is struck, and sometimes people<br>\
do strike fire with some of them: they are not<br>\
what are called مَرْو; [but] resembling بِلَّوْر [i. e.<br>\
crystal]. (TA.)<br>\
مِعْبَلٌ An implement with which trees are cut<br>\
[down]. (TA.)<br>\
مِعْبَلَةٌ A broad and long arrow-head: (As, S,<br>\
O, K:) or an iron [arrow-head] made broad,<br>\
and having no عَيْر [or central ridge]: (AHn,<br>\
TA:) pl. مَعَابِلُ. (O, K.) [See also سِرْوَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also An arrow having a broad head. (Freytag,<br>\
from the Deewán of the Hudhalees.)]<br>\
مُعَبِّلٌ One having with him مَعَابِل [pl. of مِعْبَلَة]<br>\
of arrows. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
مَعْبُولٌ [pass. part. n. of عَبَلَهُ; as such, Cut,<br>\
&amp;c.: ―<br>\
-b2-  and] Repelled: thus in the following<br>\
verse, cited by IAar:<br>\
هَا إِنَّ رَمْيِى عَنْهُمُ لَمَعْبُولْ<br>\
فَلَا صَرِيخَ الْيَوْمَ إِلَّا الْمَصْقُولْ<br>\
[Now verily my shooting in defence of them is<br>\
repelled; so there is no aider to-day but the<br>\
polished sword]: the speaker was shooting at his<br>\
enemy, and the shooting availed not at all; so he<br>\
fought with the sword. (O.)<br>\
