عَقْرَبَ He twisted, wreathed, curled,<br>\
curved, or bent, a thing. (MA.)<br>\
-A2-  [And, accord. to Freytag, He imitated the scorpion in<br>\
acting: but for this he names no authority; and<br>\
I doubt its correctness: see the next paragraph.]<br>\
Q. 2<br>\
تَعَقْرَبَ [It was crisp and curved; said<br>\
of a lock of hair hanging down upon the temple:<br>\
so accord. to Reiske, as mentioned by Freytag.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And He acted like &#39;Akrab; a man notorious<br>\
for putting off the fulfilment of his promises; as<br>\
is said in the TA in the present art.]. (A and<br>\
TA in art. عرقب: see Q. 2 in that art.)<br>\
عَقْرَبٌ [The scorpion;] a certain venomous<br>\
reptile, (TA,) well known: (K, TA:) the word<br>\
is masc. (TA) and it is fem., (S, O, K, TA,)<br>\
generally the latter; (T, Msb, TA;) but is applied to the male and the female: (Lth, T, O,<br>\
Msb, TA:) and the male is called ↓ عُقْرُبَانٌ, (T,<br>\
S, O, Msb, K, TA,) accord. to some, (O,) when<br>\
one desires to denote it in a corroborative manner,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) and ↓ عُقْرُبَّانٌ also; (K;) or these<br>\
two words are syn. with عَقْرَبٌ: (K:) and the<br>\
female is called ↓ عَقْرَبَةٌ, (T, S, O, Msb, K,) sometimes, (T, Msb,) and ↓ عَقْرَبَآءُ, which is imperfectly decl.; (S, O, K;) or these two words and<br>\
عَقْرَبٌ, accord. to the “ Tahreer et-Tembeeh,” all<br>\
denote the female, and the male is called ↓ عُقْرُبَانٌ:<br>\
(TA:) or, as some say, the male and the female<br>\
are called only عَقْرَبٌ: (Msb, TA:) and of ↓ عُقْرُبَانٌ<br>\
it is said by IB, on the authority of AHát, that<br>\
it does not signify the male of عَقَارِب, but [as<br>\
expl. below] “ a certain creeping thing, having<br>\
long legs: ” (TA:) IJ says that you may drop<br>\
the ا and ن, and say ↓ عُقْرُرَّان: (L, TA:)<br>\
and an instance occurs of ↓ عَقْرَابٌ, as a coll. gen. n.,<br>\
in the following verse:<br>\
أَعُوذُ بِاللّٰهِ مِنَ العَقْرَابِ<br>\
اَلشَّائِلَاتِ عُقَدَ الأَذْنَابِ<br>\
[I seek protection by God from the scorpions<br>\
raising the joints of the tails]: but the ا here is<br>\
said to be inserted for the purpose of what is<br>\
termed الإِشْبَاع: (MF, from the “ Mukhtasar el-Bayán: ”) and الشائلات is applied as an epithet to<br>\
a sing. n. because this is used as a coll. gen. n.:<br>\
(M voce سَبْسَبٌ:) the pl. of عَقْرَبٌ is عَقَارِبُ. (S,<br>\
O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] العَقْرَبُ is the name of (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
certain sign of the Zodiac, (T, S, O, K,) [i. e. Scorpio,] to which belong the Mansions of the Moon<br>\
called الشَّوْلَةُ and القَلْبُ [and الإِكْلِيلُ] and<br>\
الزُّبَانَيَانِ. (T, TA. [See these words, and see<br>\
also شِيبَانُ, and مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ in art. نزل. It should<br>\
also be observed that the Arabs extended the<br>\
figure of this constellation (as they did that of<br>\
Leo) far beyond the limits that we assign to it.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, likewise,] عَقْرَبٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  A thong,<br>\
or strap, of a sandal, (O, K, TA,) in the form of<br>\
the reptile of this name. (TA.) [See also عَقْرَبَة.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A thong, or strap, (O, K,) plaited, and<br>\
having a buckle at its extremity, (O,) by which<br>\
the crupper of a horse, or the like, is bound to<br>\
the saddle. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And the pl. عَقَارِبُ signifies also (tropical:)  Malicious and mischievous misrepresentations, calumnies, or slanders. (O, K, TA.)<br>\
One says, إِنَّهُ لَتَدِبُّ عَقَارِبُهُ (tropical:)  Verily his malicious<br>\
and mischievous misrepresentations, &amp;c., creep<br>\
along: (TA:) or he traduces, or defames, people<br>\
behind their backs, or otherwise. (O, K.) And<br>\
the phrase دَبَّتْ عَقَارِبُهُ is sometimes used to signify (tropical:)  His downy hair crept [along his cheeks].<br>\
(MF.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And (tropical:)  Reproaches for benefits conferred:<br>\
so in the saying of En-Nábighah,<br>\
عَلَىَّ لِعَمْرٍو نِعْمَةٌ بَعْدَ نِعْمَةٍ<br>\
لِوَالِدِهِ لَيْسَتْ بِذَاتِ عَقَارِبِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [I owe unto &#39;Amr favour after favour, for his<br>\
father, not accompanied by reproaches for benefits<br>\
conferred]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And (assumed tropical:)  Hardships, severities,<br>\
difficulties, troubles, or distresses. (K.) عَقَارِبُ<br>\
الشِّتَآءِ means (assumed tropical:)  The hardships, severities, &amp;c., of<br>\
winter: (TA:) or the intense cold thereof: (O,<br>\
K:) and عَقْرَبُ الشِّتَآءِ, accord. to IB, the assault,<br>\
and intense cold, of winter. (TA.) And عَيْشٌ ذُو<br>\
عَقَارِبَ means (assumed tropical:)  An uneasy life: or a life in which<br>\
is evil and roughness. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  See also the next<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
عَقْرَبَةٌ: see عَقْرَبٌ, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  An<br>\
iron thing like the كُلَّاب [or flesh-hook], which is<br>\
suspended, or attached, to the horse&#39;s saddle. (O,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, of a sandal, (assumed tropical:)  The knots of the<br>\
[thong, or strap, called] شِرَاك [q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And, (O, K,) thus in all the copies of the K,<br>\
and in the handwriting of Ibn-Mektoom, but in<br>\
the L ↓ عَقْرَب, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  An intelligent female slave,<br>\
who does much service, or work. (O, L, K, TA.)<br>\
عَقْرَبَآءُ: see عَقْرَبٌ, first sentence.<br>\
عُقْرُبَانٌ: see عَقْرَبٌ, first sentence, in three<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, [or it has this meaning only, as<br>\
stated above, voce عَقْرَبٌ,] A certain creeping<br>\
thing, having long legs, and the tail of which<br>\
is not like that of the عَقْرَب [or scorpion]: (S, IB,<br>\
O, TA:) or a small creeping thing that enters the<br>\
ear; long, yellow, and having many legs: (TA:)<br>\
i. q. دَخَّالُ الأُذُنِ [an appellation now applied to<br>\
the earwig]; (Az, K;) and (K) so ↓ عُقْرُبَّانٌ.<br>\
