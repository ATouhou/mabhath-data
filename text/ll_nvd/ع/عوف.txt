عَافَتِ الطَّيْرُ, (Sh, O, K,) aor. تَعُوفُ, inf. n.<br>\
عَوْفٌ, (Sh, O,) The birds circled over a thing,<br>\
(Sh, O, K,) or over the water, or over carcasses<br>\
or corpses: or circled over a thing, going to and<br>\
fro and not going away, desiring to alight: (K:)<br>\
AA says that the medial radical is و; others say<br>\
that it is ى, as will be shown in art. عيف. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And عَافَ He (a man, TA) kept, or clave, to<br>\
the trees, or plants, called عَوْف. (O, K, * TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعوّف He (a lion) sought, or sought for or<br>\
after, the prey, by night. (TA.) [It is used as<br>\
intrans. and as trans.:] see عَوْفٌ and عُوَافَةٌ.<br>\
عَافٌ i. q. سَهْلٌ [A soft tract, or a plain, &amp;c.].<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\
عَوْفٌ A state, condition, or case. (S, O, K.)<br>\
So in the saying, نَعِمَ عَوْفُكَ [May thy state, &amp;c.,<br>\
be good, or pleasant]. (S, O.) One says also,<br>\
أَصْبَحَ فُلَانٌ بِعَوْفِ سَوْءٍ, and بِعَوْفِ خَيْرٍ, meaning<br>\
[Such a one entered upon the morning, or, simply,<br>\
became,] in an evil state, and in a good state: or,<br>\
accord. to some of the lexicologists, one should<br>\
not say بِعَوْفِ خَيْرٍ, but only شَرٍّ [or سَوْءٍ]. (IDrd,<br>\
O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Fortune; syn. جَدٌّ and حَظٌّ. (O, K.)<br>\
And so, accord. to some, in the saying, نَعِمَ عَوْفُكَ<br>\
[i. e. May thy fortune be good]. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And i. q. طَائِرٌ [as meaning An omen]. (K, TA.)<br>\
And thus it is said to signify in the form of<br>\
prayer above mentioned: (TA:) [for,] as some<br>\
say, the meaning is, نَعِمَ طَيْرُكَ [May thy omen<br>\
be good]. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And The ذَكَر. (O, K.)<br>\
One says to a man on the morning after his first<br>\
going in to his wife, نَعِمَ عَوْفُكَ, meaning thereby<br>\
the ذَكَر [i. e. May thy ذكر be in a good state].<br>\
(O, TA.) A&#39;Obeyd says, Some men used to<br>\
explain (يَتَأَوَّلُ [for which يَتَنَاوَلُ is erroneously put<br>\
in the O]) العَوْف as the فَرْج [meaning the ذَكَر],<br>\
and I mentioned it to AA, and he disapproved it:<br>\
(S, O, TA:) but a verse has been cited in which<br>\
عَوْفِى [certainly] means ذَكَرِى. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
A guest. (Lth, O, K.) And thus it has been<br>\
expl. as used in the saying, نَعِمَ عَوْفُكَ. (O, *<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And The cock. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And The<br>\
lion: because he seeks his prey (↓ يَتَعَوَّفُ) by<br>\
night. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And The wolf. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
And One who toils, or seeks the means of subsistence, for his household, or family. (IAar, O,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b10-  And A certain idol. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b11-  And<br>\
A species of trees; (O;) or a species of plants,<br>\
(AHn, O, K,) of the plants of the desert, (AHn,<br>\
O,) of sweet odour. (AHn, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b12-  أُمُّ عَوْفٍ<br>\
The جَرَادَة, (S, O,) [i. e.] the female of the جَرَاد<br>\
[or locust]. (K.) And أَبُو عَوْفٍ The جَرَاد [meaning the male locust]. (Az, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also (i. e.<br>\
عَوْفٌ) a good manner of tending or pasturing<br>\
[cattle]: (O, K:) [or rather, simply,] the tending<br>\
or pasturing [cattle]: so in the saying, إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ<br>\
العَوْفِ فِى إِبِلِهِ [Verily he is one who has a good<br>\
quality of tending, or pasturing, in respect of his<br>\
camels]. (TA.)<br>\
عُوَافٌ: see عُوَافَةٌ.<br>\
أُمُّ عُوَيْفٍ A small creeping thing (دُوَيَّبَةٌ), other<br>\
than the جَرَادَة [which is termed أُمُّ عَوْفٍ]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And, accord. to AHát, أَبُو عَوْفٍ A species of<br>\
the [beetles called] جِعْلَان [pl. of جُعَلٌ]: it is a<br>\
small creeping thing (دُوَيْبَّة), dust-coloured, that<br>\
excavates with its tail and with its two horns, and<br>\
[then] never appears. (TA.)<br>\
عُوَافَةٌ (O, K) and ↓ عُوَافٌ (K) The prey which<br>\
the lion seeks (الأَسَدُ ↓ مَا يَتَعَوَّفُهُ) by night, and<br>\
which he devours. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (both words,<br>\
K) A thing that becomes, or has become, an acquisition of any one (O, K, TA) by night. (TA.)<br>\
