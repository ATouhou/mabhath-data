عَبُدَ, inf. n. عِبَادَةٌ (IKtt, L, Msb,<br>\

God approved: and, inf. n. عُبُودَةٌ, he approved<br>\
what God did: (see the former of these ns. below:)] the verb is used in these senses only when<br>\
the object is God, or a false god, or the Devil.<br>\

عَبُدَ, inf. n.<br>\
عُبُودَةٌ and عُبُودِيَّةٌ, accord. to Lh and IKtt, but<br>\

ns., He was, or became, a slave, or in a state of<br>\
slavery: or he was, or became, in a state of<br>\
slavery, his fathers having been so before him; as<br>\
also ↓ عُبِّدَ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Lth read [in the Kur v. 65]<br>\
وَعَبُدَ الطَّاغُوتُ; explaining the meaning to be,<br>\
Et-Tághoot having become an object of worship;<br>\

committed a mistake. (L.)<br>\

He was angry with him. (Fr.) And ElFarezdak makes it trans. without a prep., saying<br>\
يَعْبَدُنِى. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He disdained, or scorned. (AZ,<br>\
S, O, L.) El-Farezdak says,<br>\
وَأَعْبَدُ أَنْ أَهْجُو كُلَيْبًا بِدَارِمِ<br>\
[And I disdain to satirize Kuleyb with Dárim:<br>\
the former being unworthy to be coupled with the<br>\
latter even as an object of satire]. (S, O, L.)<br>\

of a camel, (L,) He was, or became, affected<br>\
with mange, or scab: (L:) or with incurable<br>\
mange or scab: (O, L:) or with severe mange or<br>\

He made me to posses such a one as a slave: (A,<br>\
O, Msb, K:) so accord. to Lth: but Az says<br>\
that the meaning of أَعْبَدْتُ فُلَانًا as commonly<br>\
known to the lexicologists is اِسْتَعْبَدْتُهُ: he adds,<br>\
however, that he does not deny the meaning<br>\
assigned by Lth if it can be verified. (L.)<br>\
مُحَرَّرًا ↓ اِعْتَبَدَ, occurring in a trad., or as some<br>\
relate it, ↓ أَعْبَدَ, means He took an emancipated<br>\

(Sb, TA,) A male slave; (S, A, O, L, Msb, K;)<br>\
i. q. مَمْلُوكٌ; (L, K;) [but عَبْدٌ is now generally<br>\
applied to a male black slave; and مَمْلُوكٌ, to a<br>\
male white slave; and this distinction has long<br>\
obtained;] contr. of حُرٌّ; (S, A, O, L, Msb;) as<br>\
also ↓ عَبْدَلٌ, (L, K,) in which the ل is augmentative: (L:) and a servant, or worshipper, of<br>\
God, and of a false god, or of the Devil: (Lth,<br>\
L, &amp;c.:) [you say عَبْدُ اللّٰهِ and عَبْدُ الشَّمْسِ &amp;c.:<br>\
see also عَابِدٌ, which signifies the same; and see<br>\
the remarks in this paragraph on the pls. عَبِيدٌ<br>\
and عِبَادٌ and عَبَدَةٌ &amp;c.:] and a man, or human<br>\
being; (M, A, L, K;) as being a bondman<br>\
(مَرْبُوبٌ) to his Creator; (L;) applied to a male<br>\
and to a female; (Ibn-Hazm, TA;) whether free<br>\
or a slave: (K:) pl. أَعْبُدٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
أَعْبِدَةٌ and أَعْبَادٌ, (IKtt, TA,) [all pls. of pauc.,]<br>\
of which the first is the most commonly known,<br>\
(Msb,) and ↓ عَبِيدٌ and عِبَادٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
which two and the first are the most commonly<br>\
known of all the many pls. of عَبْدٌ, (Msb,) عَبِيدٌ<br>\
being like كَلِيبٌ as pl. of كَلْبٌ, a rare form of<br>\
pl.; (S, O;) or, accord. to some, it is a quasipl. n.; accord. to Ibn-Málik, فَعِيلٌ occurs as a<br>\
pl. measure, but sometimes they use it in the<br>\
manner of a pl. and make it fem., as in the instance of عَبِيدٌ, and sometimes they use it in the<br>\
manner of quasi-pl. ns. and make it masc., as in<br>\
the instances of حَجِيجٌ and كَلِيبٌ; (MF;)<br>\
[accord. to the general and more approved<br>\
opinion, it is a quasi-pl. n., and therefore fem.<br>\
and masc., but most commonly fem.;] and further<br>\
it should be remarked that the common people<br>\
agree in making a difference between عَبِيدٌ and<br>\
عِبَادٌ, by the former meaning slaves [and by the<br>\
latter meaning servants of God and also simply,<br>\
with the article ال, mankind], saying, هٰؤُلَآءِ عَبِيدٌ<br>\
these are slaves, and هٰذَا عَبْدٌ مِنْ عِبَادِ اللّٰهِ [this is<br>\
a servant, of the servants of God]: (Az, L:) [and<br>\
a distinction is also made between عِبَادٌ and عَبَدَةٌ,<br>\
respecting which see what follows:] other pls. of<br>\
عَبْدٌ are عُبْدَانٌ, (S, O, K,) like تُمْرَانٌ pl. of تَمْرٌ,<br>\
(S, O,) and عِبْدَانٌ, (S, O, K,) like جِحْشَانٌ pl. of<br>\
جَحْشٌ, (S, O,) and عُبُدٌ, (S, O, K,) like سُقُفٌ pl.<br>\
of سَقْفٌ, (S, O,) or this is pl. of عَبِيدٌ, like رُغُفٌ<br>\
pl. of رَغِيفٌ, (Zj,) and is also a pl. of عَابِدٌ, (L,)<br>\
and some read [in the Kur v. 65] عُبُدَ الطَّاغُوتِ,<br>\
(Akh, S, O,) and عُبْدٌ (MF) and عُبُودٌ and عُبَّدٌ<br>\
and عُبَّادٌ and عَبَدَةٌ, (IKtt, TA,) the last three of<br>\
which are also pls. of عَابِدٌ: (L:) one says of the<br>\
worshippers of a plurality of gods, هُمْ عَبَدَةُ<br>\
الطَّاغُوتِ [they are the servants of Et-Tághoot];<br>\
but the Muslims one calls عِبَادُ اللّٰهِ, meaning the<br>\
servants, or worshippers, of God: (Lth, L:) [all<br>\
these are pls. in the proper sense of the term, of<br>\
the broken class:] and عَبْدُونَ, (O, K,) a pl. of<br>\
the sound class, adopted because عَبْدٌ is originally<br>\
an epithet: (TA:) and [the following, with the<br>\
exception of the first, and of some which are particularized as being pls. of pls., are also said to<br>\
be pls., but are properly speaking quasi-pl. ns.,<br>\
namely,] ↓ عَبُدٌ, (O, K,) accord. to some, who<br>\
read [in the Kur ubi suprà] عَبُدَ الطَّاغُوتِ, making<br>\
the former a prefixed noun, as meaning the servants (خَدَم) of Et-Tághoot; but it is a n. of<br>\
the measure فَعُلٌ, like حَذُرٌ and نَدُسٌ, not a pl.;<br>\
the meaning being the servant (خَادِم) of Et-<br>\
Tághoot; (Akh, S, O;) and it is also used by<br>\
poetic license for عَبْدٌ; (Fr, T, S, O;) and ↓ عِبِدَّانٌ<br>\
and ↓ عِبِدَّآءُ and ↓ عِبِدَّى; (S, O, K;) or, accord.<br>\
to some, the last of these signifies slaves born in a<br>\
state of slavery; and the female is termed ↓ عَبْدَةٌ;<br>\
and Lth says that ↓ عِبِدَّى signifies a number of<br>\
slaves born in a state of slavery, generation after<br>\
generation; but Az says that this is a mistake,<br>\
that عِبِدَّى اللّٰهِ signifies the same as عبَادُ اللّٰهِ, that<br>\
it is thus used in a trad., and that عِبِدَّى is applied<br>\
in another trad. to poor men of the class called<br>\
أَهْلُ الصُّفَّة; (L;) and ↓ عُبُدَّآءُ and ↓ عِبِدَّةٌ and<br>\
↓ عِبَادٌّ (IKtt, TA) and ↓ مَعْبَدَةٌ, like مَشْيَخَةٌ, (T,<br>\
O, K,) and ↓ مَعْبُودَآءُ (Yaakoob, S, O, K) and<br>\
↓ مَعْبُودَى, (IKtt, TA,) and [pl. pl.] ↓ مَعَابِدُ, (O,<br>\
K,) said to be pl. of مَعْبَدَةٌ; (TA;) and pl. pl.<br>\
أَعَابِدُ, (K,) pl. of أَعْبُدٌ; (TA;) and عَبِيدُونَ,<br>\
(Es-Suyootee, MF,) app. pl. of ↓ عَبِيدٌ. (MF.)<br>\
فَادْخُلِى فِى عِبَادِى, in the Kur lxxxix. 29, means<br>\
Then enter thou among my righteous servants:<br>\
(Ksh, Bd, Jel:) or it means فِى حِزْبِى [among<br>\
my peculiar party]. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  Ignoble,<br>\
or base-born; like as حُرٌّ is used to signify<br>\
“ generous,” “ noble,” or “ well-born. ” (Mgh in<br>\
art. حر.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain plant, of sweet odour,<br>\
(O, K, TA,) of which the camels are fond because<br>\
it makes the milk to become plentiful, and fattens;<br>\
it is sharp, or hot, (حَادّ O, or حَارّ TA,) in temperament; and when they depasture it they become thirsty, and seek the water: (O, TA:) so<br>\
says IAar. (O.)<br>\

Ibn-&#39;Arafeh) Angry. (L.) And (both words)<br>\
Disdaining, or disdainful; scorning, or scornful.<br>\
(L.) Accord. to AA, العَابِدِينَ in the words of<br>\
the Kur [xliii. 81], إِنْ كَانَ لِلرَّحْمٰنِ وَلَدٌ فَأَنَا أَوَّلُ<br>\
↓ العَابِدِينَ, means The disdainers, or scorners, and<br>\
the angry: (S, * L:) but Ibn-&#39;Arafeh rejects this<br>\
assertion: (TA:) these words are variously explained; as meaning There is not to the Compassionate a son; and I am the first of the angry<br>\
disdainers or scorners of the assertion that there<br>\
is: or, and I am the first of the deniers of this<br>\
assertion: or, and I am the first of the worshippers of God according to the unitarian doctrine,<br>\
or, of the worshippers of God of this people: or<br>\
if there were to the Compassionate a son, I would<br>\
be the first of his worshippers: or if there be to<br>\
the Compassionate a son, I am the first of worshippers; but I am not the first worshipper of<br>\
God: or, accord. to Az, the best interpretation<br>\
is one ascribed to Mujáhid; i. e. if there be to<br>\
the Compassionate a son in your opinion, I am<br>\
the first of those who have worshipped God alone,<br>\
and who have thus charged you with uttering a<br>\
falsehood in this your assertion. (L.)<br>\

عَبَدَةٌ [as a subst. from عَبِدَ (q. v.), Anger. ―<br>\

fatness]. (S, O.) And one says [also] نَاقَةٌ عَبَدَةٌ<br>\
[if this be not a mistake for the phrase here next<br>\
preceding] meaning A strong she-camel. (L, Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And Lastingness, or continuance; syn. بَقَآءٌ;<br>\
(O, L, K, TA;) in some lexicons نَقَآءٌ; (TA;)<br>\
