عَشَا, (TA, and so accord. to some copies of<br>\
the K,) first pers. عَشَوْتُ, (S,) aor. يَعْشُو, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. عَشْوٌ and عُشُوٌّ; (KL;) as also عَشِىَ, like<br>\
رَضِىَ [i. e. having for its aor. يَعْشَى, but the<br>\
inf. n. is app. عَشًا, as in the similar sense expl. in<br>\
the next sentence]; (TA, and so in my MS. copy<br>\
of the K;) i. q. ↓ تعشّى, (S, K, TA,) [which is<br>\
more commonly used than either of preceding<br>\
verbs, and] which signifies He ate the [eveningmeal, or evening-repast, or supper, i. e. what is<br>\
called the] عَشَآء. (Msb, K, TA.) And عَشِيَتِ<br>\
الإِبِلُ, (ISk, S, K, TA,) aor. تَعْشَى, inf. n. عَشًا,<br>\
(ISk, S, TA,) i. q. ↓ تَعَشَّت [i. e. The camels ate<br>\
the evening-pasture, or evening-feed, called the عَشَآء].<br>\
(ISk, S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَشَاهُ, (K,) first pers.<br>\
عَشَوْتُهُ, (S, Msb,) aor. يَعْشُوهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. عَشْوٌ;<br>\
(K, TA;) and inf. n. عَشْىٌ also, (TA, and thus in<br>\
some copies of the K,) thus correctly, as in the M,<br>\
عشيانًا in [some of] the copies of the K being a<br>\
mistake for عَشْيًا, the aor. being also يَعْشِيهِ; (TA;)<br>\
i. q. ↓ عشّاهُ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) [which is more commonly used than either of the preceding verbs,]<br>\
inf. n. تَعْشِيَةٌ, (S,) i. e. He fed him (namely, a<br>\
man, Msb, or a horse, or a camel, (S) with the<br>\
[evening-meal, or supper, or the evening-pasture<br>\
or evening-feed, i. e. what is called the] عَشَآء; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) as also ↓ اعشاهُ: (K:) and عَشَا الإِبِلَ,<br>\
(K, TA,) like دَعَا [i. e. having for its aor. يَعْشُو];<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ عشّاها; He pastured the camels by<br>\
night. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَشَوْتُهُ also signifies I repaired, or betook myself, to, or towards, him, or<br>\
it, by night: and hence ↓ عَاشٍ is applied to any<br>\
one repairing, or betaking himself, to or towards<br>\
[an object]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَشَوْتُ إِلَى النَّارِ, aor.<br>\
أَعْشُو, inf. n. عَشْوٌ, I sought to be directed, or<br>\
guided, or I directed, or guided, myself, by weak<br>\
eyesight, to the fire: (S:) or I looked at the fire,<br>\
or endeavoured to see it, and repaired, or betook<br>\
myself, to it, or towards it; and I saw it, or<br>\
looked towards it trying whether I could see it,<br>\
and sought to be directed, or guided, to it by its<br>\
light: (Har p. 535:) El-Hotei-ah says,<br>\
مَتَى تأْتِهِ تَعْشُو إِلَى ضَوْءِ نَارِهِ<br>\
تَجِدْ خَيْرَ نَارٍ عِنْدَهَا خَيْرُ مُوقِدِ<br>\
[When thou comest to him, looking with blinking<br>\
eyes towards the light of his fire and seeking to be<br>\
guided by it thereto, thou findest the best fire, and<br>\
at it is the best kindler]; meaning مَتَى تَأْتِهِ عَاشِيًا;<br>\
using the marfooa verb between two verbs whereof<br>\
each is mejzoom because the verb in the future<br>\
tense when it occurs in the place of a denotative<br>\
of state is marfooa: (S:) or عَشَا النَّارَ and إِلَى<br>\
النَّارِ, inf. n. عَشْوٌ and عُشُوٌّ; as also النَّارَ ↓ اعتشى<br>\
and بِالنَّارِ; signifies he saw the fire by night from<br>\
afar, and repaired, or betook himself, to it, or towards it, seeking to light himself thereby, (K, TA,)<br>\
and hoping to obtain thereby guidance and good.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَشَا عَنِ النَّارِ He turned away and<br>\
went from the light of the fire. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
عَشَوْتُ عَنْهُ I went, or turned, from him, or it, to<br>\
another: whence, it is said, the saying in the<br>\
Kur [xlii. 35], وَمَنْ يَعْشُ عَنْ ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمٰنِ [And<br>\
such as turns from the admonition of the Compassionate]. (S. See another explanation of this<br>\
saying in what follows.) [This and other meanings expl. below are app. from what here next<br>\
follows.] ―<br>\
-b5-  عَشِىَ, aor. يَعْشَى, (S, Msb, K,) dual<br>\
يَعْشَيَانِ, not يَعْشَوَانِ, (S,) inf. n. عَشًا, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
He was, or became, weak-sighted: (Msb:) or he<br>\
did not see by night, but saw by day: (S:) or he<br>\
had bad sight by night and by day: or he was,<br>\
or became, blind: [said of a man, and of a beast<br>\
of the equine kind, and of a camel, and of a bird:<br>\
(see عَشًا, below:)] and عَشَا, aor. يَعْشُو, signifies<br>\
the same: (K:) or the two verbs differ in meaning; so as that وَمَنْ يَعْشَ عَنْ ذِكْرِ الرَّحْمٰنِ, in<br>\
the Kur xliii. 35, thus read by some, means (assumed tropical:)  And<br>\
such as is blind to the admonition of the Compassionate, i. e., to the Kur-án; but مَنْ يَعْشُ, as others<br>\
read, (assumed tropical:)  such as feigns himself blind: (Ksh and<br>\
Bd: *) [see also 6: and see another explanation<br>\
of the latter reading, above: or] عَشَا signifies also<br>\
he (a man, TA) did as does the أَعْشَى [q. v.]. (K,<br>\
TA.) One says also, عشى مِنَ الشَّىْءِ, aor. يعشو,<br>\
[thus in my original, but the pret. is app. عَشِىَ,<br>\
and the aor. يَعْشَى,] meaning He lacked strength<br>\
of sight to perceive the thing. (TA.) And عَشِىَ<br>\
عَنْ حَقِّهِ like عَمِىَ in measure and in meaning<br>\
[i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, blind to his right, or<br>\
due]. (TA.) And لَا يَعْشَى إِلَّا بَعْدَ مَا يَعْشُو is one<br>\
of their sayings, meaning [app. He will not become<br>\
weak-sighted except] after his eating the [eveningmeal called the] عَشَآء: (TA:) [for it is said that]<br>\
the eating of food in the night occasions weakness<br>\
of sight more than [do] other things. (Har p. 52.<br>\
[العشآء is there written in one instance for العَشَا.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  عَشِىَ عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. عَشًا, means He wronged him;<br>\
treated him wrongfully, injuriously, unjustly, or<br>\
tyrannically: (K, TA:) mentioned by ISd. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
عَشَّوَ see 1, former half, in two places. One says,<br>\
عَشِّ وَلَا تَغْتَرَّ, (Meyd, TA,) or عَشِّ إِبِلَكَ وَلَا تَغْتَرَّ<br>\
[a prov., meaning Pasture thy camels by night,<br>\
and be not negligent, or be not made to desire<br>\
what is vain, or false]. (S. [See Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov., ii. 92.]) And عَشَّيْتُ الإِبِلَ عَنِ الوِرْدِ I pastured the camels with the [evening-pasture called]<br>\
عَشَآء, so that they might come to the water having<br>\
satisfied themselves with food: and in like manner<br>\
one says, ضَحَّيْتُهَا عَنْهُ. (A and TA in art. ضحو<br>\
and ضحى.) And عَشِّ رُوَيْدًا Pasture thou the<br>\
camels in the evening (عَشِيًّا) gently: and in like<br>\
manner one says, ضَحِّ رُوَيْدًا. (A, TA.) And<br>\
hence, عشّى عَنِ الأَمْرِ (inf. n. تَعْشِيَةٌ, K) (tropical:)  He<br>\
acted gently, or deliberately, in the affair: (A<br>\
and TA in art. ضحو and ضحى, and S * and K *<br>\
in the present art.:) and in like manner, ضَحَّى<br>\
عَنْهُ. (A and TA in the former art., and S * in<br>\
the present art.)<br>\
-A2-  See also the next paragraph.<br>\
[Hence,] عشّى الطَّيْرَ, inf. n. تَعْشِيَةٌ, He kindled a<br>\
fire for the birds in order that they might become<br>\
dim-sighted (لِتَعْشَى) and consequently be captured.<br>\
(M, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَعْشَوَ see 1, former half. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] اعشى<br>\
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He gave. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  And اعشاهُ He<br>\
(God) rendered him أَعْشَى [i. e. weak-sighted, &amp;c.:<br>\
and in like manner one says ↓ عشّاهُ: see 2, last<br>\
sentence; and see also Har p. 52].<br>\
5<br>\
تَعَشَّوَ see 1, first quarter, in two places. One says<br>\
also, تعشّى بِهِ He fed himself with it [in the evening, or] in the time called the عِشَآء: and [in like<br>\
manner] تَتَعَشَّاهُ is said of camels [as meaning<br>\
they feed themselves with it, or pasture upon it,<br>\
in the evening]. (TA.) And when one says to<br>\
thee, تَعَشَّ [Eat thou the evening-meal], thou<br>\
sayest, مَا بِى تَعَشٍّ, (S,) or مَا بِى مِنْ تَعَشٍّ, (TA,)<br>\
[I have no desire for eating the evening-meal; see 5<br>\
in art. غدو;] and not مَا بِى عَشَآءٌ, (S,) or not ما<br>\
بي مِنْ عَشَآءٍ (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 6.<br>\
-A3-  And تعشّاهُ<br>\
signifies also He gave him an عِشْوَة [or عُشْوَة, i. e.<br>\
a firebrand]. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تعاشى He feigned himself أَعْشَى [i. e. weaksighted, &amp;c.; and so ↓ تعشّى as used by Bd in xliii.<br>\
35]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] (tropical:)  He feigned himself ignorant, (K, TA,) عَنْ كَذَا [of such a thing],<br>\
as though he did not see it; like تَعَامَى. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اعتشى He journeyed in the time of the عِشَآء<br>\
[or nightfall]: (K, TA:) like اهتجر meaning “ he<br>\
journeyed in the time of the هَاجِرَة. ” (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also 1, latter half.<br>\
10<br>\
استعشاهُ He found him to be deviating from<br>\
the right course, or acting wrongfully, injuriously,<br>\

it is in human beings, and beasts of the equine<br>\
kind (دَوَابّ), and camels, and birds; as is said<br>\
in the M: (TA:) or it is darkness that happens<br>\
to the eye: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or blindness; (K,<br>\
TA;) i. e. absolute destitution of sight. (TA.)<br>\
عَشٍ applied to a he-camel, and عَشِيَةٌ applied to<br>\
a she-camel, That exceeds the other camels in the<br>\
[evening-pasture, or evening-feed, called] عَشَآء;<br>\
each after the manner of the possessive epithet,<br>\
having no verb. (TA. [And عَشِىٌّ is said to have<br>\
a similar meaning.])<br>\
-A2-  See also أَعْشَى.<br>\
عَشْوَةٌ Darkness, (K, TA,) in [any part of] the<br>\
night and in the سَحَر [or period a little before daybreak]; (TA;) as also ↓ عَشْوَآءُ: (K:) or the first of<br>\
the darkness of the night: (Az, TA:) or the<br>\
period between the beginning and [the end of] the<br>\
[first] quarter of the night: (AZ, S, K:) thus in<br>\
the saying, مَضَى مِنَ اللَّيْلِ عَشْوَةٌ [A period between the beginning &amp;c. of the night passed]: and<br>\
one says also, أَخَذْتُ عَلَيْهِمْ بِالعَشْوَةِ, meaning [I<br>\
laid hold upon them] in the blackness of night:<br>\
(AZ, S:) the dim. is ↓ عُشَيَّةٌ. (Az, TA.) In the<br>\
saying جَآءَ عَشْوَةَ, meaning عِشَآءً [i. e. He came at<br>\
nightfall], it [is an adv. n. which] may not be<br>\
used otherwise than thus: you may not say,<br>\
مَضَتْ عَشْوَةُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  العشوة [app. العَشْوَةُ] as<br>\
meaning العَشَآءُ, like الغدوة [app. الغَدْوَةُ] as meaning الغَدَآءُ, is vulgar. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The venturing upon, or embarking in, an affair that is<br>\
not clear; as also ↓ عِشْوَةٌ and ↓ عُشْوَةٌ: (S, K:)<br>\

meaning [Thou hast made me to venture upon, or<br>\

غَدْيَانُ [q. v.] which is originally غَدْوَانُ, (TA,)<br>\
A man (S) eating the [evening-meal, or eveningrepast, i. e. what is called the] عَشَآء; (S, K,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ عَاشٍ. (TA.)<br>\
عَشَآءٌ The meal, or repast, (S, Msb, K,) of the<br>\

[or late part of the evening, &amp;c.]; (S, * K, TA;)<br>\
[i. e. supper, in a general sense;] opposed to<br>\
غَدَآءٌ; (S;) as also ↓ عِشْىٌ: (K: [in the CK,<br>\
العِشٰى is erroneously put for العِشْىُ:]) and in like<br>\
manner both are used in relation to camels [as<br>\
meaning their evening-pasture, or evening-feed:<br>\
see an ex. voce عَتَمَةٌ, and another voce أَقْعَسُ]:<br>\
(S, TA:) pl. of the former أَعْشِيَةٌ; (K, TA;) to<br>\
which is added, in [some of] the copies of the<br>\
K, and عُشِىٌّ; but this is correctly عَشِىَ, [or عَشَا,<br>\
as in some copies,] and commences another sentence. (TA.)<br>\
عِشَآءٌ [The time of nightfall; i. e.] the first, or<br>\
beginning, of the darkness (Msb, K) of night:<br>\
(Msb:) [this is the sense in which it is generally<br>\
used, and always when it is used as applied to<br>\
one of the five times of the divinely-appointed acts<br>\
of prayer; صَلَاةُ العِشَآءِ, and elliptically العِشَآءُ<br>\
alone, meaning the prayer of nightfall:] or it is<br>\
[the time] when the sun has disappeared: (Az,<br>\
TA:) or [the time] from sunset (K) [i. e.] from<br>\
the prayer of sunset (Msb, TA) to the عَتَمَة [or<br>\
darkness after nightfall]; (Msb, K, TA;) [and<br>\
this is what is meant by its being said that it is]<br>\
syn. with عَشِىٌّ: (S:) or [the time] from the زَوَال<br>\
[meaning the declining of the sun from the meridian] to the rising of the dawn: (S, K:) so<br>\
some assert, and they cite, as an ex.,<br>\
غَدَوْنَا غُدْوَةً سَحَرًا بِلَيْلٍ<br>\
عِشَآءً بَعْدَ مَا انْتَصَفَ النَّهَارُ<br>\
[We went early in the morning, a little before<br>\
daybreak, in a period between the declining of the<br>\
sun from the meridian and the rising of the dawn,<br>\
after the daytime had become halved]: (S, TA:)<br>\
[sometimes] the Arabs said, أَقْبَلَتِ العِشَآءُ, meaning العَشِيَّةُ; and هٰذَا العَشِيَّةُ, meaning العِشَآءُ.<br>\
(Msb voce صَوْتٌ.) العِشَاآنِ means The time of<br>\
sunset and the عَتَمَة [or darkness after nightfall]:<br>\
(IF, S, Msb, K: [compare<br>\
הָעַרְבַּיִ� in Exodus<br>\
xii. 6 and xvi. 12:]) this is accord. to the saying<br>\
that the عِشَآء is from the prayer of sunset to the<br>\
عَتَمَة. (TA.)<br>\
عَشَاوَةٌ: see عَشًا.<br>\
عَشِىٌّ [The late part of the evening: or the<br>\
evening: or the afternoon: i. e.] the last, or the<br>\
latter, part of the day; (Mgh, Msb, K, TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ عَشِيَّةٌ: (K, TA:) this is the meaning<br>\
commonly known: (Mgh:) or [the time] from<br>\
the prayer of sunset to the عَتَمَة [or darkness after<br>\
nightfall]; (S, Msb, TA;) like عِشَآءٌ; (Msb;)<br>\
and so ↓ عَشِيَّةٌ: you say, أَتَيْتُهُ عَشِىَّ أَمْسِ and<br>\
أَمْسِ ↓ عَشِيَّةَ [I came to him late in the evening,<br>\
or in the time between sunset and nightfall, &amp;c.,<br>\
of yesterday]: (S, TA:) or عَشِىٌّ has the meaning<br>\
expl. in the K [and mentioned above]; but<br>\
↓ عَشِيَّةٌ relates to one day: and one says, جِئْتُهُ<br>\
عَشِيَّةً [I came to him late in an evening, &amp;c.] and<br>\
عَشِيَّةَ [late this evening, &amp;c.], and أَتَيْتُهُ العَشِيَّةَ I<br>\
came to him in the عشيّة [or late part of the<br>\
evening, &amp;c.,] of this day; and آتِيهِ عَشِىَّ غَدٍ [I<br>\
will come to him in the late part of the evening,<br>\
&amp;c., of to-morrow (in my original اتيته, an obvious mistranscription,)] without ة when relating<br>\
to the future; and أَتَيْتُكَ عَشِيًّا [I came to thee in<br>\
the late part of an evening, &amp;c.]; and أَتَيْتُهُ بِالغَدَاةِ<br>\
وَالعَشِىِّ i. e. [I came to him early in the morning<br>\
and late in the evening, &amp;c., meaning,] every<br>\
عَشِيَّة [or عَشِىّ] and غَدَاة: (TA:) or, as some<br>\
say, ↓ عَشِيَّةٌ is a sing. [or n. un.] and عَشِىٌّ is its<br>\
pl. [or a coll. gen. n.]: and, as IAmb says,<br>\
sometimes the Arabs make ↓ عَشِيَّةٌ masc., as<br>\
meaning عَشِىٌّ: (Msb:) or عَشِىٌّ signifies the<br>\
time between the declining of the sun [from the<br>\
meridian] and sunset: (Az, Mgh, Msb, TA:) or<br>\
[the time] from the declining of the sun [from the<br>\
meridian] to the صَبَاح [app. here, as generally,<br>\
meaning morning]: (Er-Rághib, Msb, TA:) and<br>\
sometimes it means the night: (TA:) the pl. is<br>\
عَشَايَا and عَشِيَّاتٌ, (K, TA,) the former of which<br>\
[is pl. of ↓ عَشِيَّةٌ, like the latter, or perhaps of<br>\
عَشِىٌّ also, and] is originally عَشَايِوُ, then عَشَايِىُ,<br>\
then عَشَائِىُ, then عَشَاءَى, and then عَشَايَا: (TA:)<br>\
the dim, of عَشِىٌّ is ↓ عُشَيَّانٌ, irreg., as though<br>\
formed from عَشْيَانٌ, and its pl. is عُشَيَّانَاتٌ; and<br>\
another form of its dim. is ↓ عُشَيْشِيَانٌ, pl.<br>\
عُشَيْشِيَانَاتٌ: and the dim. of ↓ عَشِيَّةٌ is ↓ عُشَيْشِيَةٌ,<br>\
pl. عُشَيْشِيَاتٌ: (S, TA:) one says, ↓ لَقِيتُهُ عُشَيْشَةً<br>\
[another form of dim., properly meaning I met<br>\
him in a short period of a late part of an evening,<br>\
&amp;c.], and [in like manner] ↓ عُشَيْشَانًا, and ↓ عُشَيَّانًا<br>\
[in some copies of the K عشّانا], and ↓ عُشَيْشِيَةً<br>\
[accord. to the Mgh meaning عِشَآءً], and عُشَيْشَاتٍ,<br>\
and عُشَيْشِيَانَاتٍ. (K.) صَلَاتَا العَشِىِّ [The two<br>\
prayers of the afternoon] means the two prayers<br>\
of the ظُهْر and the عَصْر; (Az, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
because they are in the latter part of the day<br>\
(فِى آخِرِ النَّهَارِ), after the زَوَال [or declining of<br>\
the sun from the meridian]. (TA.) In the phrase<br>\
أَوْضُحَاهَا ↓ عَشِيَّةً [i. e. A late part of an evening,<br>\
&amp;c., or its early portion of the forenoon, meaning<br>\
or an early portion of the forenoon of the same<br>\
civil day], in the Kur lxxix. last verse, the ضحى<br>\
is prefixed to [the pronoun referring to] the<br>\
عشيّة because the ضحى and the عشيّة belong to<br>\
the same [civil] day, [for this day is reckoned as<br>\
the period from sunset to sunset,] (Ksh Bd, Jel, *)<br>\
and also [by a kind of poetic license, for the sake<br>\
of the rhyme, i. e.] because ضحاها occurs as a<br>\
فَاصِلَة [q. v.]. (Jel.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَشِىٌّ also signifies, (K,<br>\
TA,) and so does ↓ عَشِيَّةٌ, (K,) Clouds (K, TA)<br>\
