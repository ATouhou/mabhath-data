عَقَى الأَمْرَ, aor. يَعْقِى: see 1 in art. عقو.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
عَقَى, aor. as above, inf. n. عَقْىٌ, said of an infant,<br>\
(S, K,) He voided his عِقْى; (K;) [i. e.] he voided<br>\
his ordure for the first time, and, after that, while<br>\
he was a youngling. (S.) It is said in a trad. of<br>\
I&#39;Ab, that when a child once suckled by a woman<br>\
voids his عِقْى, she and her children become, to<br>\
him, within the prohibited degrees of marriage,<br>\
because it is known thereby that the milk has<br>\
entered his belly. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  مَا أَدْرِى مِنْ أَيْنَ<br>\
عُقِيتَ and ↓ اعْتُقِيتَ mean I know not whence<br>\
thou camest, or hast come. (K, * TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
عقّى He (a bird) rose high in his flight. (S,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَقَّتِ الدَّلْوُ The bucket rose in the<br>\
well turning round. (TA in art. عقو.) [See<br>\
also 1, (last sentence,) in art. عق.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And عقّى<br>\
بِسَهْمِهِ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَعْقِيَةٌ, (K,) He shot his<br>\
arrow [up] into the air; (S, K;) a dial. var. of<br>\
عَقَّهُ [or rather of عَقَّ بِهِ]. (S.) The Hudhalee,<br>\
(S,) El-Mutanakhkhil, (TA,) or Aboo-Dhu-eyb,<br>\
(L in art. وضح,) says,<br>\
عَقَّوْا بِسَهْمٍ فَلمْ يَشْعُرْ بِهِ أَحَدٌ<br>\
ثُمَّ اسْتَفَاؤُوا وَقَالُوا حَبَّذَا الوَضَحُ<br>\
[They shot an arrow towards the sky, and no one<br>\
knew of it: then they returned, and said, An<br>\
excellent thing is milk]; (S, TA;) meaning, “we<br>\
would rather have milk than the blood of him<br>\
who killed our companion; ” preferring that camels<br>\
should be given them as a compensation: (L in<br>\
art. وضح:) it is related [thus] with fet-h to the<br>\
doubled ق, so that its place is here; and also<br>\
with damm thereto, so that its place is art. عق,<br>\
in which it has been mentioned. (TA. [See a<br>\
similar verse cited voce عَقَّ, and the explanation<br>\
thereof, there preceding that verse.])<br>\
-A2-  And عقّاهُ,<br>\
inf. n. as above, He gave him to drink [or to<br>\
swallow] what would cause his عِقْى [q. v.] to pass<br>\
forth, (K, TA,) or honey in order that it might<br>\
have that effect. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اعقى It was, or became, bitter, (K,) or<br>\
intensely bitter. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And اعقاهُ He removed it from his mouth because of its bitterness:<br>\
(S, K:) like as one says أَشْكَيْتُهُ meaning “ I removed him from that of which he complained,”<br>\
(S, TA,) [or “ I removed from him that of which<br>\
he complained,”] the hemzeh having a privative<br>\
effect. (TA.) It is said in a prov., لَا تَكُنْ حُلْوًا<br>\
فَتُسْتَرَطَ وَلَا مُرًّا فَتُعْقَى, (S, TA,) or فَتُعْقِىَ, accord.<br>\
to different relaters. (TA. [See 1 in art. سرط,<br>\
where both these readings are expl., and where<br>\
the reading فَتُسْرَطَ is given instead of فَتُسْتَرَطَ.])<br>\
8<br>\
إِعْتَقَىَ see 1, last sentence.<br>\
عِقْىٌ What comes forth from the belly of the<br>\
child (S, Msb, K) before he eats, (S,) or when he<br>\
is born, (Msb, K,) black and viscous as though it<br>\
were glue; (Msb;) and likewise from the mare&#39;s<br>\
foal, and the young ass, and the young camel, and<br>\
the kid; (ISd, TA;) or what comes forth from<br>\
the lamb or kid, and the mare&#39;s foal, is called<br>\
رَدَجٌ: (S, TA:) and Az states that it is said to<br>\
be what comes forth from the belly of the fœtus,<br>\
inclosed in the [membrane called] حُوَلَآء [q. v.]; a<br>\
thing [or substance] that comes forth from its anus<br>\
while it is in the belly of its mother, part of it<br>\
black and part of it yellow: (TA:) pl. أَعْقَآءٌ.<br>\
(Az, K, TA.) أَحْرَصُ مِنْ كَلْبٍ عَلَى عِقْىِ صَبِىٍّ<br>\
is a prov. [meaning More eager than a dog for<br>\
the feces of a young child]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
youngling, or young infant: whence the saying<br>\
of Z, ↓ فُلَانٌ لَهُ عِقْيَانِ وَلَيْسَ عِنْدَهُ العِقْيَانُ i. e. Such<br>\
a one has two younglings, or young infants, but<br>\
gold is not in his possession. (TA.)<br>\
عِقْيَانٌ Gold: (KL:) or pure gold: (S, TA:)<br>\
or gold that grows, [meaning native gold,] (S, K,<br>\
TA,) not such as is produced from the stones, (S,<br>\
TA,) or, as in the M and A, not such as is educed,<br>\
by melting, from the stones: the ا and ن are augmentative. (TA.) See an ex. in the latter sentence of the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
أَعْقَى [More, and most, intensely, or nauseously,<br>\
bitter]. (AHn, TA voce شَيْلَمٌ.)<br>\
مُعَقٍّ Circling over a thing, aloft, like the eagle.<br>\
