therefore, if without the article ال, imperfectly<br>\
decl.;] The هَاجِرَة [or midday; or midday in<br>\
summer, or when the heat is vehement; &amp;c.].<br>\

water again at night, then returning from the<br>\
water, and remaining the rest of the night in the<br>\
pasturage, and the next day and night, then<br>\
coming to the water in the morning between daybreak and sunrise: this is one of the descriptions<br>\

or making, or causing, to be faulty, &amp;c.; or<br>\
blaming, &amp;c.;] as in the L. (TA.)<br>\

decl., means The female hyenas, so called as<br>\
though they were a قَبِيلَة [or tribe]; (Sh, O, K;)<br>\
and so ↓ عُرَاجُ, likewise determinate, and imperfectly decl.: (K:) or, accord. to IAar, in the<br>\
phrase ↓ أَبْنَآءُ عُرْجَ in a verse of Aboo-Muk&#39;it ElAsadee, the poet makes the latter word, which is<br>\
a pl., imperfectly decl. because he means التَّوْحِيد<br>\
وَالعُرْجَة; as though he regarded it as a sing.<br>\
[proper] name: (L: [i. e., accord. to Ibr D, because he uses عُرْجَ as a sing. proper name, curtailed by poetic license from العُرْجَة: if so, this<br>\
last word seems here to signify a personification<br>\
of lameness:]) and accord. to him (i. e. IAar),<br>\
one says ↓ هٰذِهِ عُرَاجُ, meaning This is the female<br>\
hyena [not hyenas]; the latter word imperfectly<br>\
decl. (O.) ―<br>\

certain deaf, malignant serpent. (TA.) [See<br>\

[perhaps in allusion to the curved aspect of the<br>\
moon; though on this ground it might also be<br>\
applied to three nights of the last part:] mentioned<br>\
on the authority of Th. (TA.)<br>\
الأُعَيْرِجُ [dim. of الأَعْرَجُ] A certain deaf serpent,<br>\
(O, K, TA,) of the most malignant of serpents,<br>\
(TA,) that will not admit of being charmed, and<br>\
that leaps up like the viper: (O, K:) accord. to<br>\
ISh, a certain broad serpent, having a single<br>\
broad leg; like the [serpent called] أَصَلَة: IAar<br>\
says, it springs upon the horseman so as to become<br>\
with him on his saddle: (O:) the word has<br>\
no fem. form: (Lth, O, K:) [but] the pl. is<br>\
الأُعَيْرِجَاتُ. (O, K.)<br>\

of these with ال,] a thing resembling a دَرَجَة [i. e.<br>\
ladder, or series of steps or stairs], upon which the<br>\
souls ascend when they are taken [from their<br>\
bodies]: it is said that there is nothing more<br>\
beautiful than it; so that when the soul sees it,<br>\
it cannot refrain from making its exit [from the<br>\
body]: (TA:) hence لَيْلَةُ المِعْرَاجِ [the Night of<br>\
the Ladder; in which Mohammad is related to<br>\
have ascended from Jerusalem to Heaven, after<br>\
having been conveyed to the former from Mekkeh<br>\
upon the beast named البُرَاق]: pl. مَعَارِيجُ and<br>\
مَعَارِجُ, like مَفَاتِيحُ and مَفَاتِحُ. (S, O.) Also,<br>\
(K,) or [properly the last only, i. e.] ↓ مَعْرَجٌ, (L,<br>\
Msb, TA,) A place of ascent: (L, Msb, K, TA:)<br>\
and the way whereby the angels ascend: (TA:)<br>\

signifies places of ascent: (S, A, O:) and in the<br>\
Kur lxx. 3, the places of ascent of the angels: or<br>\
it there means benefits, or favours: (O:) and<br>\
مِعْرَاجٌ is [said to be] like مَعْرَجٌ [in meaning,<br>\
though this is a loose explanation]. (Msb.)<br>\
