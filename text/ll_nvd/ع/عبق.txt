عَبِقَ بِهِ الطِّيبُ, [aor.<br>\
عَبَقَ,] inf. n. عَبَقٌ (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, K) and عَبَاقِيَةٌ (S, O, K) and عَبَاقَةٌ,<br>\
(O, K,) The perfume clung to him, or it, (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, K, TA,) and remained; and so عَسِقَ به;<br>\
(TA;) and the odour of the perfume clung to him,<br>\
or it: (Mgh:) or the odour of the perfume was,<br>\
or became, perceptible in his garment or his<br>\
person: and it is said to relate only to fragrant<br>\
odour. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And in like manner one says<br>\
of a garment, عَبِقَ بِالجِسْمِ [It clung to the body].<br>\
(TA.) And عَبِقَ الشَّىْءُ بِغَيْرِهِ The thing clave, or<br>\
kept, to another. (Msb.) And عَبِقَ الشَّىْءُ بِقَلْبِى<br>\
(tropical:)  The thing stuck to my heart. (TA.) And عَبِقَ<br>\
بِالمَكَانِ He remained, stayed, dwelt, or abode, in<br>\
the place. (O, K.) And عَبِقَ بِهِ (tropical:)  He became<br>\
attached to him, or it. (O, K, TA.) [See also<br>\
رَصِعَ بِالطِّيبِ.]<br>\

التَّعْبِيقُ signifies التَّذْكِيَةُ [used in relation to<br>\
wine, app. as meaning The becoming old; though<br>\
the latter word, thus used, is probably tropical].<br>\
(O, K.) &#39;Adee Ibn-Zeyd says, describing wine,<br>\
صَانَهَا التَّاجِرُ اليَهُودِىُّ حَوْلَيْ<br>\
نِ فَأَذْكَى مِنْ نَشْرِهَا التَّعْبِيقُ<br>\
[which seems to be cited as meaning, The Jewish<br>\
merchant kept it two years, and the becoming old<br>\
enhanced its fragrance: but I think that the last<br>\
word may be more properly rendered the making<br>\
it to remain long in its jar]. (O.)<br>\
Q. Q. 3<br>\
اِعْبَنْقَى He (a man, S) became cunning, or very cunning: (صَارَ دَاهِيَةً: S, O, K:) or<br>\
became evil in disposition: (K:) and in like<br>\
manner signifies اِبْعَنْقَى. (TA.)<br>\
عَبَقٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
عَبِقٌ Perfume [clinging to a person or thing,<br>\
and remaining; and of which the odour clings:<br>\
(see 1, first sentence:) or] of which the odour is<br>\
perceptible in the garment or person: (Msb:) it<br>\
is applied as an epithet to an odour; and ↓ عَبَقٌ<br>\
also, as the inf. n., meaning ذُو عَبَقٍ. (Ham p.<br>\
710.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to a man, Such that, when he<br>\
has perfumed himself with the least perfume, it<br>\
does not leave him for days: and in like manner<br>\
with ة applied to a woman. (Lth, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
عَبِقَةٌ لَبِقَةٌ, applied to a woman, means Whom<br>\
every dress and perfume suits. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And the<br>\
Khuzá&#39;ees, who were the most chaste speakers of<br>\
Arabic, said رَجُلٌ عَبِقٌ لَبِقٌ as meaning ظَرِيفٌ<br>\
[i. e. A man excellent, or elegant, in mind, manners, and address or speech; and in person, countenance, or garb: &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
عَبَقَةٌ Feculence (وَضَرٌ) of clarified butter,<br>\
[adhering to the interior] in a skin; (IDrd, S, O,<br>\
K;) also termed عَبَكَةٌ; (IDrd, O, TA;) and<br>\
عَمَقَةٌ, in which the م is asserted by Lh to be a<br>\
substitute for ب. (TA.) And one says, مَا فِى<br>\
النِّحْىِ عَبَقَةٌ, meaning There is not aught [remaining] of clarified butter in the skin; (S, O;) as<br>\
also عَبَكَةٌ. (S and O in art. عبك.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
one says also, مَا بَقِيتْ لَهُمْ عَبَقَةٌ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [There remained not to them] any relic [of<br>\
their possessions]. (TA.)<br>\
عِبِقَّانٌ رِبِقَّانٌ, [in the CK, erroneously, عَبْقانُ<br>\
رَبْقانُ,] and with ة [affixed to each], applied to a<br>\
man, Evil in disposition: and with ة applied to a<br>\
female: so in the K; but this is inconsistent<br>\
with what here follows: (TA:) accord. to As,<br>\
عِبِقَّانٌ رِبِقَّانٌ and عِبِقَّانَةٌ رِبِقَّانَةٌ are applied to a<br>\
man, meaning as above; and to the woman in<br>\
like manner. (O, TA.)<br>\
رَجُلٌ عَبَاقَآءُ A man who sticks to another.<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\
عَبَاقِيَةٌ, applied to a man, (S, O, K,) Guileful,<br>\
or crafty; (K;) cunning, or very cunning; (S,<br>\
O, K;) evil, or mischievous. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A<br>\
thief, (O, K,) who steals camels, (خَارِبٌ, K,) or<br>\
who strips people forcibly of their clothes, (حَارِبٌ,<br>\
O,) who will not refrain from anything: thus<br>\
expl. by Ish. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A scar caused by a<br>\
wound in the ball, or most elevated part, of the<br>\
cheek. (S, O, K.) So in the saying, بِهِ شَيْنٌ<br>\
عَبَاقِيَةٌ [In him is a blemish, a scar &amp;c.], (S,) or<br>\
شَيْنٌ وَعَبَاقِيَةٌ [a blemish and a scar &amp;c.]. (O.)<br>\
-A3-  And A certain thorny tree, (O, K, TA,) that<br>\
hurts (O, TA) him who is caught by its thorns;<br>\
said by AHn to be of the [kind called] عِضَاه.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عُقَابٌ عَبَنْقَاةٌ (S, O, K) and عَبَنْقَآءُ (K) and<br>\
عَقَنْبَاةٌ, (S, O,) like قَعْنَبَاةٌ, (O, K,) An eagle<br>\
having sharp talons: (S, O:) or, accord. to<br>\
IDrd, hard and strong [in the talons]. (O.)<br>\
