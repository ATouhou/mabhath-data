عَفَّ, (S, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
عَفِ3َ, (S, O,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. عِفَّةٌ and عَفَافٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
عَفٌّ and عَفَافَةٌ, (S, O, K,) He abstained (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K) from (عن) what was unlawful, (S, O,)<br>\
or from what was not lawful nor comely or decorous, (M, K,) or from things that should be<br>\
sacred or inviolable, and base, or carnal, objects<br>\
of inordinate desire, (TA,) or from a thing:<br>\
(Msb:) [but it is implied in the K that the verb is<br>\
used without the expression of the object, or objects; and it is very often so used, as meaning he<br>\
was abstinent, continent, chaste, virtuous, modest,<br>\
decent, or decorous:] and ↓ استعفّ signifies the<br>\
same; (K;) as also ↓ تعفّف: (Msb, K:) or this<br>\
last signifies, (S, O,) or signifies also, (K,) he affected, or constrained himself, to abstain from<br>\
what was unlawful: (S, O, K:) or he was<br>\
patient, and kept himself remote, or aloof, from a<br>\
thing [that was unlawful or the like]: (TA:)<br>\
and عَنِ المَسْأَلَةِ ↓ استعفّ means he abstained (عَفَّ)<br>\
from begging: (S, O:) whence the trad. of the<br>\
Prophet اِسْتَعْفِفْ عَنِ السُّؤَالِ مَا اسْتَطَعْتَ [Abstain<br>\
thou from begging, as much as thou art able]:<br>\
(O:) or, as some say, الاِسْتِعْفَافُ signifies the seeking to abstain from what is unlawful, and from<br>\
begging of men: and one says also, عَنِ ↓ اعتفّ<br>\
القَبِيحِ [he abstained from that which was evil, or<br>\
foul]; this being [likewise] from العِفَّةُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَفَّ said of milk, aor<br>\
عَفِ3َ, (IDrd, O, K,) inf. n.<br>\
عَفٌّ, (IDrd, O,) It collected in the udder:<br>\
(IDrd, O, K:) or it remained in the udder;<br>\
(K;) or thus عَفَّ فِى الضَّرْعِ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.)<br>\
2<br>\
عَفَّفْتُهُ, inf. n. تَعْفِيفٌ, I gave him to drink<br>\
what is termed عُفَافَة [q. v.]. (IDrd, O, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اعفّهُ اللّٰهُ God made him to be عَفِيف [i. e.<br>\
abstinent, &amp;c.]. (S, O, Msb, K.)<br>\
-A2-  أَعَفَّتْ, [in<br>\
the CK, erroneously, اُعِفَّت,] said of a ewe, or<br>\
she-goat, is from العُفَافَةُ [and therefore signifies<br>\
She had milk collected in her udder: or she had<br>\
some milk remaining in her udder after most of<br>\
it had been sucked]. (IDrd, O, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعفّف: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  Also He (a man, S, O)<br>\
drank what is termed عُفَافَة [q. v.]. (S, O, K.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَعَافَّ نَاقَتَكَ Milk thou thy camel after the<br>\
first milking. (S, O, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تعافّ said<br>\
to a sick man, Treat thyself medically. (K.)<br>\
One says, بِأَىِّ شَىْءٍ نَتَعَافُّ With what thing shall<br>\
we treat ourselves medically ? (AA, O, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِعْتَفَ3َ see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  اعتفّت الإِبِلُ اليَبِيسَ The camels<br>\
took with the tongue [or licked up] the dry herbage<br>\
above the earth or dust, taking the best, or choice,<br>\
thereof; as also ↓ استعفّت. (O, K.)<br>\

إِسْتَعْفَ3َ see 1, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also 8.<br>\
عَفٌّ; and its fem.: see عَفيِفٌ.<br>\
عُفَّةٌ: see عُفَافَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also An old woman: (Ibn-El-Faraj, O, K, TA:) like عُثَّةٌ: being formed<br>\
[from the latter] by substitution. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And<br>\
A certain fish, smooth, white, and small; when<br>\
cooked, having a taste like that of rice. (Ibn-ElFaraj, O, K.)<br>\
عِفَافٌ A medicine, or remedy. (AA, O, K.)<br>\
عَفِيفٌ and ↓ عَفٌّ epithets from عَفَّ, as such<br>\
signifying Abstaining (S, O, Msb, K) from what<br>\
is unlawful, (S, O,) or from what is not lawful<br>\
nor comely or decorous, (K,) or from things that<br>\
should be sacred or inviolable, and base, or carnal, objects of inordinate desire, (TA,) or from a<br>\
thing: (Msb:) [and very often used as meaning<br>\
abstinent, continent, chaste, virtuous, modest, decent,<br>\
or decorous:] fem. of the former with ة; (S, O, K;)<br>\
and so of ↓ the latter, (S, O, Msb, K,) which has<br>\
no broken pl.: (TA:) the pl. masc. (of عَفِيفٌ,<br>\
Msb, TA) is أَعِفَّآءُ (O, Msb, K, TA) and أَعِفَّةٌ:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) عَفِيفَةٌ, applied to a woman, signifies<br>\
excellent, or high-born, good, righteous, or virtuous; and [more commonly] continent, or chaste;<br>\
(TA;) and the pl. of this is عَفَائِفُ and عَفِيفَاتٌ.<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\
عُفَافَةٌ is the subst. from عَفَّ said of milk: (O,<br>\
K:) so says IDrd: (O:) [accord. to him, it app.<br>\
signifies Milk that has collected in the udder:]<br>\
and it signifies (S, O, K) accord. to another or<br>\
others, (O,) as also ↓ عُفَّةٌ, somewhat of milk remaining in the udder (S, O, K) after most of it<br>\
has been sucked. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And F explains<br>\
العُفَافَةُ, with damm, by the words أَنْ تَأْخُذَ الشَّىْءِ<br>\
بَعْدَ الشَّىْءِ فَأَنْتَ تَعْتَفُّهُ [as though signifying The<br>\
taking thing after thing, by licking it up, or otherwise, from the ground, choosing the best thereof:<br>\
but this mode of explanation is often used in<br>\
lexicons to denote the thing, or things, mentioned<br>\
therein; not the act: and I think that what is<br>\
here meant is the thing, or things, thus taken:<br>\
this, moreover, is agreeable with the general<br>\
analogy of words of the measure فُعَالَةٌ; as is<br>\
shown by many exs. in the Mz, 40th نوع]. (TA.)<br>\
جَآءَ عَلَى عِفَّانِ ذٰلِكَ He (a man, S, O) came at<br>\
the time of that: (S, O, K: *) a dial. var. of<br>\
إِفَّان: (S, O:) or, accord. to IF, formed [from the<br>\
latter] by substitution. (O.)<br>\
