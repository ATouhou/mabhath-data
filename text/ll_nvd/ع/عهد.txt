manner, أَنَا أُعْهِدُكَ مِنْ هَذٰا الأَمْرِ I hold thee, or<br>\
make thee, secure from this thing. (TA.) Hence<br>\
the term ↓ عُهْدَةٌ. (TA.) And the latter phrase<br>\
signifies [also] I am responsible for thy security<br>\
from this thing. (ISh, O, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعهّدهُ He renewed his acquaintance with it,<br>\
or his knowledge of it; (S, O, L, Msb, K;) this<br>\
is the proper signification; (Msb;) as also<br>\

and ↓ عاهدهُ, inf. n. مُعَاهَدَةٌ: (L:) and he sought<br>\
it, or sought for it or after it, it being absent from<br>\
him; syn. تَفَقَّدَهُ; as also ↓ تعاهدهُ, and ↓ اعتهده:<br>\
(K:) or تعهّدهُ and تفقّدهُ are used, by some, each<br>\
in the place of the other; but accord. to Er-Rághib and many others, the former signifies he<br>\
sought, or sought leisurely or repeatedly, to obtain<br>\
knowledge of it, having known of it before; and<br>\
the latter, he sought, or sought leisurely or repeatedly, to obtain knowledge of it, having lost it:<br>\
(MF in art. فقد:) or تعهّدهُ signifies he renewed<br>\
his acquaintance with it, or his knowledge of it,<br>\
and sought, or sought leisurely or repeatedly, to<br>\
find means of rectifying it, reforming it, or putting<br>\
it into a good or right or proper state: (IDrst,<br>\
TA:) or he came to it, and rectified it, reformed<br>\
it, or put it into a good or right or proper state:<br>\
(Mgh:) or as first expl. above, and also he returned to it time after time, or went frequently to<br>\
it, and rectified it, reformed it, or put it into a<br>\
good or right or proper state: (Msb:) or, simply, [as also ↓ تعاهدهُ,] he returned, or recurred,<br>\
to it time after time, [see an instance voce أَخْرَقُ,]<br>\
or went frequently to it: (Et-Tedmuree, TA:)<br>\
and also [i. e. both signify also he paid repeated,<br>\
or frequent, attention to it; or] he was careful,<br>\
or mindful, of it; or attentive to it. (S, O,<br>\
Msb. *) One says also, تَعَهَّدْتُ فُلَانًا [I renewed<br>\
my acquaintance with such a one; repaired, or<br>\
betook myself, to him frequently; paid frequent<br>\
attention to him; or simply paid attention to<br>\
him]. (S, O.) And تَعَهَّدْتُ ضَيْعَتِى, (S, O, Mgh,)<br>\
properly signifying I renewed my acquaintance<br>\
with, or my knowledge of, my estate, is used as<br>\
meaning I came to my estate, and put it into a<br>\
good or right or proper condition: (Mgh:) [or I<br>\
paid repeated, or frequent, or much, attention to<br>\
it, taking good and effectual care of it; I husbanded it well:] or, accord. to IDrst, the verb<br>\
here has the meaning given above on his authority: or, accord. to Ed-Tedmuree, the meaning<br>\
is that given above as his explanation; and is<br>\
from عَهْدٌ as signifying “ rain that falls after other<br>\
rain,” or from the same word as signifying “ a<br>\
place of abode in which one has known a thing: ”<br>\
(TA:) and one may say also ↓ تَعَاهَدْتُ; (Fr,<br>\
ISk, Mgh;) but تَعَهَّدْتُ is more chaste, (El-Fá-<br>\
rábee, S, O, Msb,) because ↓ تَعَاهُدٌ is only between two [or more]: (S, O:) or تعاهدت is not<br>\
allowable, (AZ, AHát, Th, IF, Msb,) for the<br>\
reason just mentioned: (IF, Msb:) AZ says that<br>\
six Arabs of the desert, of chaste speech, being<br>\
asked in the presence of himself and of Yoo, one<br>\
after another, whether they said تعهّدت ضيعتى<br>\
or ↓ تعاهدت, all answered, تعهّدت. (AHát, TA.)<br>\
One also says, of a man, يَتَعَهَّدُهُ صَرْعٌ [Epilepsy<br>\
befalls him repeatedly, or time after time]. (S, O.)<br>\

says also, اسْتَعْهَدْتُهُ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ, meaning I made<br>\
him responsible for accidents [arising, or that<br>\
might arise,] from himself. (O, K. *)<br>\

subst.,] An injunction, a charge, a bidding, an<br>\

a phrase tropically abridged, meaning (tropical:)  It is in<br>\

covenant, an agreement, a confederacy, a league,<br>\
a treaty, an engagement, a bond, an obligation,<br>\
or a promise: (S, A, Mgh, O, L, Msb, K, TA:)<br>\
pl. عُهُودٌ: or, accord. to AHeyth, ↓ عَهْدَةٌ has this<br>\
this meaning, and عَهْدٌ is its pl. [or rather a<br>\
coll. gen. n.]. (TA.) Hence وَلِىُّ عَهْدٍ The suc-<br>\
cessor by virtue of a covenant of a Khaleefeh [or<br>\
King]. (TA.) [And وِلَايَةُ عَهْدٍ The succession<br>\
by virtue of a covenant.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Protection, or safeguard; a promise, or an assurance, of security or<br>\
safety; responsibility, or suretiship; syn. أَمَانٌ;<br>\

and ↓ عِهْدَانٌ [which last is said in the S and O<br>\
to be syn. with عَهْدٌ, but in what sense is not<br>\
there specified]. (K.) Hence, ذُو عَهْدٍ, an appel-lation given to a Christian, and a Jew, [and a<br>\
Sabian, who is a subject of a Muslim government,] meaning One between whom and the Muslims a compact, or covenant, subsists, whereby<br>\
the latter are responsible for his security [and<br>\
freedom and toleration] as long as he acts agreeably to the compact [by living peaceably with them<br>\
and paying a poll-tax]; (Mgh, * Msb, * TA;) [i. e.<br>\

pass. forms being both applied to such a person<br>\
because the compact is mutual; (Msb;) both<br>\
syn. with ذِمِّىٌّ: (S:) persons of this description<br>\
are called collectively أَهْلُ العَهْدِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  An<br>\
oath: (S, A, O, K:) pl. عُهُودٌ: or, accord. to<br>\
AHeyth, ↓ عَهْدَةٌ signifies an oath whereby one<br>\
secures himself against him with whom he makes<br>\
a compact, contract, covenant, or the like, and<br>\
عَهْدٌ is its pl. [or rather a coll. gen. n.]. (TA.)<br>\

says, عَلَىَّ عَهْدُ اللّٰهِ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ كَذَا [The oath by<br>\

abode, O Umm-Málik; but chains have surrounded<br>\
the necks;] is expl. as meaning, the case is not as<br>\
thou knewest it; but El-Islám has come, and has<br>\
