عَنَاهُ الأَمْرُ, aor. يَعْنِيهِ and يَعْنُوهُ, inf. n. عِنَايةٌ<br>\
and عَنَايَةٌ (K, TA) and عُنِىٌّ, (TA, as from the K,<br>\
but not in the CK nor in my MS. copy of<br>\
the K,) The affair, or event, or case, disquieted<br>\
him; syn. أَهَمَّهُ [more fully expl. by what here<br>\
follows]: (K, TA:) [عَنَاهُ may be generally<br>\
rendered it concerned him; agreeing with this<br>\
in meaning it made him uneasy in mind,<br>\
anxious, or careful; and in meaning it affected<br>\
his interest, or was of importance to him; like<br>\
أَهَمَّهُ: and also it concerned him meaning it related, or belonged, to him; or was of his business;<br>\
as will be shown by what follows: and] عَنَانِى<br>\
كَذَا, aor. يَعْنِينِى, means such a thing occurred, or<br>\
happened, to me, and occupied me [or my mind].<br>\
(Msb.) The saying [in the Kur lxxx. 37], لِكُلِّ<br>\
امْرِئٍ مِنْهُمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ شَأْنٌ يَعْنِيهِ, thus accord. to one<br>\
reading, means يُهِمُّهُ [i. e. To every man of them<br>\
shall belong, on that day, a business that will disquiet him, &amp;c.]: (Ksh, Bd;) or a business in<br>\
conjunction with which no other will disquiet him:<br>\
and like this is the other reading, which is with<br>\
غ; (TA;) i. e. يُغْنِيهِ, meaning which will suffice<br>\
him in respect of his being disquieted thereby;<br>\
(Ksh, Bd;) or the meaning of the latter reading<br>\
is, [a business such that] he will not be able, in<br>\
conjunction with his being disquieted thereby, to<br>\
be disquieted by any other; (TA;) or a state that<br>\
will occupy him so as to divert him from the state<br>\
of any other. (Jel.) And it is said in a trad.<br>\
respecting charming, بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ أَرْقِيكَ مِنْ كُلِّ دَآءٍ<br>\
يَعْنِيكَ i. e. [By the name of God I charm thee<br>\
from, or against, any disease] that may disquiet<br>\
thee, &amp;c., (يُهِمُّكَ,) and occupy thee [or thy mind].<br>\
(TA.) And in another trad. it is said, مِنْ حُسْنِ<br>\
إِسْلَامِ المْرْءِ تَرْكُهُ مَا لَا يَعْنِيهِ, meaning مَا لَا يُهِمُّهُ<br>\
[i. e. A condition of the goodness of the man&#39;s submitting himself to the requirements of God is his<br>\
leaving, or relinquishing, that which does not disquiet him, &amp;c.]; (S, TA;) the exceptions therefrom being such things as necessary food and<br>\
clothing. (So in a marginal note in a copy of<br>\
the Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer of Es-Suyootee.) See also<br>\
the prov.<br>\
مُعْتَرِضٌ لِعَنَنٍ لَمْ يَعْنِهِ<br>\
expl. voce عِنَانٌ. [It is like the common saying,<br>\
يَتَكَلَّمُ فِيمَا لَا يَعْنِيهِ He talks of that which does<br>\
not concern him; meaning that which does not<br>\
relate, or belong, to him; or that which is not of<br>\
his business.] ―<br>\
-b2-  عُنِىَ in the phrase عُنِىَ بِالأَمْرِ is<br>\
[said to be] one of a class of verbs used in the<br>\
pass. form though having the sense of the act.<br>\
form, like زُهِىَ: (S in art. زهو:) [but is expl. as<br>\
though pass. of عَنَاهُ meaning as above, or quasipass.:] you say, عُنِىَ بِالأَمْرِ, with damm, (K, TA,)<br>\
i. e. in the pass. form, (TA,) inf. n. عِنَايَةٌ, (K,<br>\
TA,) with kesr; (TA;) and عَنِىَ بِهِ, of the class<br>\
of رَضِىَ, (K, TA,) mentioned by IDrst and others<br>\
of the expositors of the Fs, and by Hr and Mtr,<br>\
(MF, TA,) and by IKtt on the authority of Et-<br>\
Toosee, (TA,) but this is seldom used, (K, TA,)<br>\
the former being that which is commonly known,<br>\
and this alone being mentioned by Th in his Fs,<br>\
and by J and others; (TA;) i. q. اِهْتَمَّ بِهِ [i. e.<br>\
He became disquieted by the affair, or case; or<br>\
rendered uneasy in mind, anxious, or careful, by<br>\
it; and consequently, he became occupied by it,<br>\
or with it; or set about it, and managed it]; as<br>\
also بِهِ ↓ اِعْتَنَى: (K, TA:) or بِأَمْرِهِ ↓ اِعْتَنَيْتُ<br>\
means I became disquieted by his affair, or case;<br>\
or rendered uneasy in mind, anxious, or careful,<br>\
by it; (اِهْتَمَمْتُ بِهِ;) and minded it; or managed<br>\
it well; (اِحْتَفَلْتُ بِهِ;) and عَنَيْتُ بِهِ, of the class<br>\
of رَمَى, inf. n. عِنَايَةٌ, signifies the same: and<br>\
عُنِيْتُ بِأَمْرِ فُلَانٍ, in the pass. form, inf. n. عِنَايَةٌ<br>\
and عُنِىٌّ, signifies I became occupied [either<br>\
actually or (as is shown by what follows) in<br>\
mind] by, or with, the affair, or case, of such a<br>\
one; and sometimes one said عَنَيْتُ بِأَمْرِهِ [in this<br>\
sense as well as the similar sense expl. above],<br>\
using the act. form: (Msb:) one says [also],<br>\
عُنِيتُ بِحَاجَتِكَ, with damm to the first letter,<br>\
[which may be rendered I became occupied by,<br>\
or with, thy want,] aor. أُعْنَى, inf. n. عِنَايَةٌ: (S:)<br>\
and لِتُعْنَ بِحَاجَتِى, (S, Msb,) which is the imperative form, (S,) meaning [Be thou occupied<br>\
by, or with, my want; or] let my want occupy,<br>\
or busy, thy mind: (Msb:) and in interrogating,<br>\
you say, كَيْفَ مَنْ تُعْنَى بِأَمْرِهِ [How is he by, or<br>\
with, whose affair, or case, thou art occupied, or<br>\
disquieted, &amp;c.?]: you do not say, in this case,<br>\
تَعَنَّى [for تَتَعَنَّى]. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عَنَى اللّٰهُ بِهِ,<br>\
[inf. n. عِنَايَةٌ, as is implied in the TA,] means<br>\
God preserved him: (Msb, TA:) and it is said<br>\
that it may be from عَنَى بِحَاجَتِهِ [as syn. with<br>\
عُنِىَ بِهَا]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَنِىَ, (S, Msb,) thus in<br>\
the Tahdheeb of IKtt, (TA,) with kesr, (S, TA,)<br>\
of the class of تَعِبَ, (Msb,) aor. يَعْنَى; (S, Msb;)<br>\
or عَنَى, (K, TA,) with fet-h, thus in the copies<br>\
of the K, and likewise in the M; (TA;) inf. n.<br>\
عَنَأءٌ, (S, K, TA,) or this is a simple subst., from<br>\
عَنَّاهُ, (Mgh, Msb,) and عَنْيَةٌ is syn. therewith;<br>\
(ISd, K, TA;) He suffered difficulty, distress, or<br>\
trouble; (S, Msb, K, TA;) or fatigue, or weariness: and ↓ تعنّى, also, has the former or the<br>\
latter meaning. (S, K, TA.) You say, عَنِيتُ فِى<br>\
الأَمْرِ, meaning ↓ تَعَنَّيْتُ [i. e. I suffered difficulty,<br>\
&amp;c., in the affair, or case]: mentioned by Az.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And عَنِىَ signifies [also] He stuck fast<br>\
in captivity; (K in this art., and Msb in art. عنو;)<br>\
as also عَنَا, inf. n. عُنُوٌّ: (Msb in art. عنو:) or both<br>\

عَنًى, (TA,) signifies The eating had an agreeable,<br>\
a wholesome, or a beneficial, effect upon him, (syn.<br>\
نَجَعَ,) and [it is said that] the aor. is يَعْنَِى, like<br>\
يَرْمِى and يَرْضَى, (K, TA,) the latter mentioned<br>\
by ISd, as being anomalous, but MF says that<br>\
the latter has not been heard unless as having its<br>\
pret. like رَضِىَ, [i. e. عَنِىَ, of which عَنًى is the<br>\
inf. n. accord. to analogy,] and [SM adds that]<br>\
thus it is accord. to IKtt, who mentions the verb<br>\
as said also, in the same sense, of the drinking of<br>\
milk; (TA in this art.;) and he states that عَنَا,<br>\
aor. يَعْنُو, inf. n. عُنُوٌّ, is a dial. var. thereof. (TA<br>\
in this art. and in art. عنو.)<br>\
-A4-  عَنَى بالقَوْلِ كَذَا,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) aor. يَعْنِى, (TA,) He meant, or intended, by the saying, such a thing; syn. أرَادَ, (S,<br>\

عَنْىٌ, signifies قَصَدْتُهُ [as meaning I intended it:<br>\
and app. in other senses expl. in art. قصد]. (Msb.)<br>\
And you say, عَنَانِى أَمْرُكَ, meaning قَصَدَنِى [i. e.,<br>\

its object]. (TA.) ―<br>\

i. e. يُقَاسِيهِ [He suffers, &amp;c., the difficulty &amp;c.<br>\
that he experiences from such a thing]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And He contended, disputed, or litigated, with<br>\
him; syn. شَاجَرَهُ: (K:) you say, لَا تُعَانِ أَصْحَابَكَ<br>\
i. e. لَا تُشَاجِرْهُمْ [Do not thou contend, &amp;c., with<br>\
thy companions]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And المُعَانَاةُ is also<br>\
syn. with المُعَالَجَةُ [inf. n. of عَالَجَ, q. v.]. (Har<br>\
p. 7.) [Hence,] one says, عانى عَمَلَ الأَقْفَاصِ<br>\
[He plied the manufacture of cages, or coops].<br>\
(TA in art. قفص.) And عُونِىَ بِأَدْوِيَةٍ [referring<br>\

(IAar, K, TA) He is disquieted [&amp;c.] by the<br>\
affair, or case: (K, TA:) [and ↓ مَعْنِىٌّ signifies<br>\

from عَنَانِى كَذَا [q. v.], means I am occupied<br>\
[either actually or in mind] by it, or with it;<br>\
i. e., a thing that has occurred, or happened, to<br>\

the same, i. e., by the affair, or case, of another,<br>\
from عَنَيْتُ بِأَمْرِهِ [q. v.]: (Msb:) and one says<br>\
[also], بِحَاجَتِكَ ↓ أَنَا مَعْنِىٌّ [I am occupied by, or<br>\
with, thy want], from عُنِيتُ بِحَاجَتِكَ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[And] part. n. from عَنِيتُ فِى الأَمْرِ [q. v.]: you<br>\
say, أَنَا عَنٍ [I am suffering difficulty, distress, or<br>\
trouble; or fatigue, or weariness; in an affair, or<br>\
case]: mentioned by Az. (TA.)<br>\
عَنْيَةٌ: see عَنَآءٌ.<br>\
عُنْيَانٌ i. q. عُنْوَانٌ [expl. in art. عنو]. (K.)<br>\
عَنَآءٌ Difficulty, distress, or trouble; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb; *) the subst. from عَنَّاهُ: (Mgh, Msb:) or<br>\
the suffering of difficulty, distress, or trouble; or<br>\
of fatigue, or weariness; inf. n. of عَنَى [or of<br>\
عَنِىَ]; and ↓ عَنْيَةٌ is syn. therewith. (K.) [See<br>\
also art. عنو.]<br>\
-A2-  It is also a subst. from عَنَى in<br>\
the phrase عَنَى بِالقَوْلِ كَذَا [as such having the<br>\
signification of the inf. n. of that verb, or perhaps<br>\
as syn. with مَعْنًى]. (TA.)<br>\
عَانٍ: see عَنٍ. [See also art. عنو.] ―<br>\
-b2-  In the<br>\
phrase عَنَآءٌ عَانٍ, it denotes intensiveness; [the<br>\
meaning being Severe difficulty, &amp;c.;] (K, TA;)<br>\
like شَاعِرٌ and مَائِتٌ in the phrases شِعْرٌ شَاعِرٌ and<br>\
مَوْتٌ مَائِتٌ: (TA:) as also ↓ مُعَنٍّ; (K, TA;)<br>\
in the M like مُكْرَمٌ [i. e. ↓ مُعْنًى]. (TA.)<br>\
هُوَ بِهِ أَعْنَى means أَكْثَرُ عِنَايَةً [i. e. He is more<br>\
disquieted, uneasy in mind, anxious, or careful,<br>\
by reason of it]. (TA.)<br>\
مَعْنًى [signifying The meaning, or intended<br>\
sense, of a word or saying,] is from عَنَى بِالقَوْلِ<br>\
كَذَا [q. v.]; so says Z: (TA:) it is an inf. n. [of<br>\
this verb] used in the sense of the pass. part. n.;<br>\
or a contraction of the latter; i. e. of مَعْنِىٌّ:<br>\
(Dict. of the Technical Terms used in the Sciences<br>\
of the Musalmans:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib, it<br>\
signifies the import of a word or an expression,<br>\
from the phrase عَنَتِ الأَرْضُ بِالنَّبَاتِ meaning “ the<br>\
land made apparent, or showed, its plants, or<br>\
herbage: ” accord. to El-Munáwee, as he says in<br>\
the Towkeef, [and the like is said in the KT,]<br>\
an idea, i. e. a mental image, considered as having<br>\
a word, or an expression, applied to denote it, and<br>\
as being intended by that word or expression: [the<br>\
idea, or mental image,] considered as accruing,<br>\
from the word or expression, in the mind, is<br>\
termed مَفْهُومٌ: considered as what is said in reply<br>\
to مَا هُوَ [“ What is it? ”], it is termed مَاهِيَّةٌ:<br>\
considered as existing objectively, [as that by<br>\
which a thing is what it is,] it is termed حَقِيقَةٌ:<br>\
and considered as distinguished from others, it is<br>\
termed هُوِيَّةٌ: (TA:) signifying [as expl. above,<br>\
i. e.] the opposite to لَفْظٌ, it may be either a substance, or thing that subsists by itself, i. e. عَيْنٌ,<br>\
or an accident, or attribute, i. e. عَرَضٌ: but it<br>\
also signifies the opposite to عَيْنٌ, i. e. the opposite<br>\
to a thing that subsists by itself: (Kull p. 238:)<br>\
[hence اِسْمُ مَعْنًى, opposed to اِسْمُ عَيْنٍ; both of<br>\
which are expl. voce اِسْمٌ, in art. سمو:] مَعْنَى<br>\
الكَلَامِ and ↓ مَعْنَاتُهُ and ↓ مَعْنِيُّهُ (S, K, TA) and<br>\
↓ مَعْنِيَّتُهُ, (K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
مَعْنِيَتُهُ, without the sign of teshdeed,]) the last<br>\
mentioned by ISd, (TA,) are one [in signification], (S, K, TA,) as syn. with فَحْوَاهُ (TA, and<br>\
so in some copies of the S,) and مَقْصَدُهُ [both of<br>\
which are generally understood as signifying the<br>\
meaning, or intended sense, of the saying]: (TA:)<br>\
AHát says, the vulgar say, لِأَىِّ مَعْنًى فَعَلْتَ<br>\
[For what intent didst thou such a thing?]; but<br>\
the Arabs know not المَعْنَى, and never say it:<br>\
this is the case: but some of the Arabs say, مَا<br>\
هٰذَا ↓ مَعْنِىُّ [i. e. What is the meaning, or intent,<br>\
(lit. the meant or intended object,) of this?], with<br>\
kesr to the ن and with the ى musheddedeh: and<br>\
AZ says, ذَاكَ ↓ هٰذَا فِى مَعْنَاةِ and فِى مَعْنَاهُ سَوَآءٌ,<br>\
i. e. This is [used] in a manner the like of that in<br>\
respect of indication and import and acceptation:<br>\
El-Fárábee, also, says, مَعْنَى الشَّىْءِ and ↓ مَعْنَاتُهُ<br>\
are one [in signification]; and مَعْنَاهُ and فَحْوَاهُ<br>\
and مُقْتَضَاهُ and مَضْمُونُهُ all signify that which the<br>\
word, or expression, [termed before the thing,]<br>\
indicates: and it is said in the T, on the authority<br>\
of Th, that المَعْنَى and التَّفْسِيرُ and التَّأْوِيلُ, are<br>\
one [in signification, as meaning explanation, or<br>\
interpretation, or the like]: and people have used<br>\
their phrase هٰذَا مَعْنَى كَلَامِهِ, and the like,<br>\
meaning this is the import, and the indication of<br>\
the meaning, of his saying; which is agreeable with<br>\
what is said by AZ and El-Fárábee: the grammarians and lexicologists, moreover, have agreed<br>\
respecting a mode of expression of which they<br>\
have made frequent use, their saying هٰذَا بِمَعْنَى<br>\
هٰذَا [this is used with the meaning of this], and<br>\
هٰذَا وَهٰذَا فِى المَعْنَى وَاحِدٌ [this and this are in<br>\
meaning one] and فِى المَعْنَى سَوَآءٌ [in meaning<br>\
alike], and هٰذَا فِى مَعْنَى هٰذَا [this is used in the<br>\
sense of this] i. e. this is like this [in meaning]:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) the pl. of مَعْنًى is مَعَانٍ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
عِلْمُ المَعَانِى is expl. by El-Munáwee in the<br>\
“ Towkeef ” as The science whereby one knows<br>\
how to express clearly one meaning in various<br>\
ways: (TA:) [but this definition is applied in<br>\
the “ Talkhees ” (Talkhees el-Miftáh), and Hájjee<br>\
Khaleefeh uses the same words with only one<br>\
unimportant variation, in explaining عِلْمُ البَيَانِ;<br>\
and a similar explanation of the latter is given in<br>\
the Kull: in a marginal note in a copy of the<br>\
Ksh, cited by De Sacy in his Anthol. Gr. Ar.<br>\
p. 305, علم المعانى is expl. as the science whereby<br>\
is known the manner of adapting language to the<br>\
requirements of the case; (and it is similarly expl.<br>\
in the “ Talkhees ” and other works;) and علم<br>\
البيان, as the science that concerns comparisons<br>\
and tropes and metonymies.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [صُورَةٌ بِلَا مَعْنًى<br>\
means A form without any intrinsic quality.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And المَعَانِى signifies also The qualities that are<br>\
commended, or approved; [the charms, or graces;]<br>\
such as knowledge, or science, and piety, and<br>\
generosity, and goodliness of make, &amp;c. (Har<br>\
p. 644.)<br>\

to لَفْظِىٌّ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and Of, or relating to, idea, mind,<br>\
