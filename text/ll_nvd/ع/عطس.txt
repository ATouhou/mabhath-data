عَطَسَ, aor.<br>\
عَطِسَ (S, A, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
عَطُسَ, (S,<br>\
O, Msb, K,) the former of which is the more<br>\
approved, and therefore it alone is mentioned in<br>\
some copies [of the K], (TA,) inf. n. عَطْسٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) or عُطَاسٌ, (S, * A,) or both, (O, K,) or<br>\
the latter is a simple subst., (TA,) He sneezed;<br>\
expl. by أَتَتْهُ العَطْسَةُ: (A, K:) [properly] said<br>\
only of a man. (MF, from the “ Iktiráh. ”) It<br>\
is said in a trad., كَانَ يُحِبُّ العُطَاسَ وَيَكْرَهُ التَّثَاؤُبَ<br>\
[He (Mohammad) used to like sneezing, and dislike yawning]: (O, TA:) because the former is<br>\
accompanied by lightness of the body, and openness of the pores, and facilitation of movements;<br>\
whereas, in yawning, the contrary is the case;<br>\
and these properties are caused by taking light<br>\
nourishment and little food and drink: (TA:)<br>\
but the Arabs used to augur evil from sneezing;<br>\
(A, O;) so that if a man were journeying and<br>\
heard a sneeze, it prevented him from going on.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَطَسَ الصُّبْحُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. عَطْسٌ,<br>\
(TA,) (tropical:)  The dawn broke: (S, K:) or shone forth.<br>\
(A, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عَطَسَتْ بِهِ اللُّجَمُ, (A, O, K,) and<br>\
اللُّجُمُ, (A,) Evil omens brought ill luck upon<br>\
him: (A, O: *) لُجَمٌ and لُجُمٌ are pls. of لُجْمَةٌ<br>\
and لِجَامٌ, which are syn. with طِيَرَةٌ, because the<br>\
طيرة refrains one from a thing that he wants: for<br>\
they used to augur evil from sneezing [as remarked above]: (A:) or he died; (A, O, K;)<br>\
as also عَطَسَ, alone. (K.) [See also غَطَسَ.]<br>\

is said, خُلِقَ السِّنَّوْرُ مِنْ عَطْسَةِ الأَسَدِ [The cat was<br>\
created from the sneeze of the lion]: (A:) [app.<br>\

meaning Such a one resembles such a one in make<br>\

same sense] they say, كَأَنَّهُ عَطْسَةٌ مِنْ أَنْفِهِ.<br>\

هُبُوبِ العُطَاسِ (tropical:)  [Such a one came before the rising<br>\
of the dawn]. (A.) And a poet says,<br>\
وَقَدْ أَغْتَدِى قَبْلَ العُطَاسِ بِسَابِحِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [And sometimes I go early in the morning, before dawn, with a horse that runs stretching out<br>\
his fore legs gracefully as if swimming]: but As<br>\
relates that the meaning is said to be, before I<br>\
hear the sneeze of a sneezer and augur evil from<br>\
it; and that he had not heard any authority<br>\
worthy of reliance for the meaning assigned by<br>\
Lth. (TA.)<br>\
عَطُوسٌ is [said to be] applied to a man as<br>\
meaning Bold in wars and rigours, (TA in this<br>\
art.,) [and to be] thus correctly, as written by<br>\

portentous event bringing ill luck befell him: (see 1,<br>\
last sentence:) or] meaning death [befell him]:<br>\
(O, K:) اللُّجَمُ being here made sing.; (A, TA;)<br>\
and so اللُّجُمُ. (TA.)<br>\
عَاطِسٌ: see عُطَاسٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and see also عَطُوسٌ.<br>\
-A3-  Also A gazelle coming towards one from before his face; (A, O, K;) i. q. نَاطِحٌ: because<br>\

(Seer, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A certain beast, from which one<br>\
