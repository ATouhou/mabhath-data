عَرِىَ (S, MA, Mgh, Msb, K) مِنْ ثِيَابِهِ, (S,<br>\
MA, Mgh, Msb,) aor. يَعْرَى, (S, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
عُرْىٌ (Mgh, Msb, K, and so in some copies of<br>\
the S, accord. to other copies of which it is عُرِىٌّ,<br>\
and also with kesr to the ع, as stated in the TA,<br>\
[العُرٰى commencing the art. in the CK is a mistake for العُرْىُ,]) and عُرْيَةٌ, (Msb, K,) He (a<br>\
man, Msb, TA) was, or became, naked, nude,<br>\
bare, or without clothing; (K, TA;) or bare of<br>\
his clothes: (MA:) and ↓ تعرّى signifies the<br>\
same: (MA, K:) [or rather] the latter is quasipass. of عرّاهُ [and therefore is more correctly rendered he was made naked, &amp;c.; or made bare of<br>\
his clothes, or denuded thereof, or divested; or he<br>\
made himself naked, &amp;c.; or denuded himself of<br>\
his clothes]. (S.) [And sometimes it means He<br>\
was, or became, bare of clothing, or of his clothes,<br>\
except one, or more, of his inner garments: and<br>\
in like manner, ↓ تعرّى, he was made, or he made<br>\
himself, bare of clothing, or of his clothes, except<br>\
one, or more, of his inner garments.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[hence] one says also, عَرِىَ البَدَنُ مِنَ اللَّحْمِ<br>\

and مَا يَعْرَى مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  He is not, or does<br>\
not become, free from this affair: and hence, لَا<br>\
يَعْرَى مِنَ المَوْتِ أَحَدٌ (assumed tropical:)  [No one will be exempt<br>\
from death]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَرَيْتُهُ I came to him;<br>\

―<br>\
-b3-  And عَرَّيْتُهُ (assumed tropical:)  I left it; or let it alone; i. e.,<br>\

divested him, (S, * MA, Msb, * K,) of his clothes,<br>\
(Msb,) or of the clothes, (MA,) or of the garment.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\

abode, in the lateral, or adjacent, part or tract<br>\
(بِالنَّاحِيَةِ). (TA.) And أَعْرَيْتُ signifies also<br>\
اِجْتَنَبْتُ [app. as meaning I was, or became, distant, remote, far off, or aloof; or I went, or<br>\
removed, or retired, or withdrew myself, to a<br>\
