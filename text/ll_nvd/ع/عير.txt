in, or into, the land, or country. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
عَارَ, (S, O, &amp;c.,) aor. as above, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
عِيَارٌ, (Msb, TA,) or this is a simple subst., (K,)<br>\
He (a horse, S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, and a dog, K)<br>\
went away (O, K, TA) hither and thither, (O,<br>\
TA,) which action is also termed مُعَايَرَةٌ [inf. n.<br>\
of ↓ عَايَرَ], (O,) as though he had made his escape<br>\
(K, TA) from his master, going to and fro:<br>\
(TA:) and the same is said of news: (IKtt,<br>\
TA:) or escaped, or got loose, and went away<br>\
hither and thither, by reason of his exceeding<br>\
sprightliness: (S:) or escaped, or got loose, and<br>\
went away at random: (Msb:) or went away<br>\
hither and thither, by reason of his sprightliness:<br>\
or strayed at random, nothing turning him:<br>\

and عَيَرَانٌ, (TA,) He (a camel) left his females<br>\
that were seven months gone with young, and went<br>\
away to others, (IKtt, L, K,) to cover them.<br>\
(IKtt, L.) In [some of] the copies of the K,<br>\
شَوْلَهَا is put in the place of شَوْلَهُ, which latter is<br>\
the reading in the Tahdheeb of IKtt [and in the<br>\
CK]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَارَهُ, aor. يَعِيرُهُ and يَعُورُهُ, (S and<br>\
K in art. عور,) or the aor. is not used, or it is<br>\
scarcely ever used, (TA in the same art.,) He, or<br>\
it, took, and went away with, him, or it: (S and<br>\

and TA in the same art.) See art. عور. You say<br>\

(TA.) And it is said in a prov., عَيْرٌ عَارَهُ وَتِدُهُ<br>\

destroyed [by preventing his escape from wild<br>\
beasts that attacked him]. (Meyd, TA. [See<br>\
Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov., ii. 87.])<br>\
-A3-  عَارَهُ, [aor. as<br>\
above,] also signifies He blamed, or reproached,<br>\
him; found fault with him; attributed or imputed<br>\
to him, or charged him with, or accused him of, a<br>\
vice, or fault, or the like. (S, O, TA.) [See also<br>\
what next follows.]<br>\
2<br>\
عيّرهُ كَذَا, (S, O, Msb, K,) and عيّره بِهِ,<br>\
though the former is the more approved, (ElMarzookee, in his Expos. of the Hamáseh, and<br>\
Msb, and MF,) or the latter is peculiar to the<br>\
vulgar, (S, and El-Hareeree in the Durrat el-Ghowwás.) and should not be used, (O, K,)<br>\
inf. n. تَعْيِيرٌ, (S, O,) He upbraided him with such<br>\
a thing; reproached him for it; declared it to be<br>\
bad, evil, abominable, or foal, and charged him<br>\
with it. (Msb.) [You also say عيّرهُ عَلَي فِعْلِهِ<br>\
He upbraided him, or reproached him, for his<br>\
deed.] And عيّر عَلَيْهِ [is an elliptical phrase, signifying the same; فِعْلَهُ or the like being understood: or He upbraided him; charged him with<br>\
acting disgracefully]. (TA, voce تعريب.) [See<br>\

inf. n. as above, (TA,) He weighed the pieces of<br>\
gold one after another: (K:) and he put, or<br>\
threw down, the pieces of gold, one by one, and<br>\
compared them, one by one. (TA.) The verb is<br>\
[said to be] used in relation to measuring and<br>\
weighing; but, says Az, Lth makes a distinction<br>\
between عَايَرْتُ and عَيَّرْتُ, making the former to<br>\
relate to a measure of capacity, and the latter to<br>\
an instrument for weighing: and [SM adds,] F<br>\
mentions the former in art. عور, and the latter in<br>\
the present art. (TA.) See also 3, in five places.<br>\
-A3-  And عيّر المَآءُ The water became overspread<br>\
with [the green substance termed] طُحْلُب: (O,<br>\
K:) but [SM adds,] it is more probably أَغْثَرَ,<br>\
with ا and غ and ث. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
عاير المَكَايِيلَ, (S, Mgh, and K in art. عور,)<br>\
and المَوَازِينَ, (S, Mgh,) inf. n. عِيَارٌ; (S;) and<br>\
عاورها, (S, K,) and عوّرها; (K;) signify the same,<br>\
(S, K,) He measured, or compared, the measures<br>\
of capacity, (Mgh, K,) and the instruments for<br>\
weighing, one by, or with, another. (Mgh.) One<br>\
should not say ↓ عيّر. (S.) The saying اِسْتَعَارَ<br>\
?? ↓ دَرَاهِمَ لِيُعَيِّرَ, meaning, [He borrowed<br>\
pieces of money] that he might equalize [with them<br>\
the weights of his balance], should be, correctly,<br>\
لِيُعَايِرَ. (Mgh.) You say عَايَرْتُ المِكْيَالَ, and<br>\
المِيزَانَ, inf. n. مُعَايَرَةٌ and عِيَارٌ, meaning I tried,<br>\
or proved, the measure of capacity, and the instrument for weighing, [or gauged the former,]<br>\
that I might know its correctness [or incorrectness]:<br>\
this, says Az, is the correct form: one should not<br>\
say ↓ عَيَّرْتُ, except from العَارُ, accord. to the leading lexicologists and ISk says, عَايَرْتُ بَيْنَ<br>\
المِكْيَالَيْنِ signifies I tried, or proved, the two<br>\
measure of capacity, that I might know their<br>\
equality [or inequality]: you should not say<br>\
المِيزَانَيْنِ ↓ عَيَّرْتُ, (Msb.) [But in the TA,<br>\
الميزان ↓ عيّر and المكيال is mentioned without<br>\
any remark of disapproval, with عاورهما and<br>\
عايرهما.] You also say عاير بَيْنَهُمَا, inf. n. مُعَايَرَةٌ<br>\
and عِيَارٌ, He measured, or compared, them two.<br>\
each by, or with, the other, and examined what<br>\
[difference] was between them. (K in art. عور.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, عاير app. signifies also He assayed<br>\
gold &amp;c.]<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, third sentence.<br>\
4<br>\
اعار الفَرَسَ, (S, K,) and الكَلْبَ, (K,) He (his<br>\
master) made the horse, and the dog, to go away<br>\
as though he had escaped, or got loose: (K:) or<br>\
made him to escape; (TA:) or made him to<br>\
escape, or get loose, and go away hither and<br>\
thither, by reason of his exceeding sprightliness.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
-A2-  أَعْيَرَ النَّصْلَ He made to the iron head or<br>\
blade of an arrow, or of a spear, or of a sword,<br>\
or of a knife, or the like, what is called عَيْرٌ. (AA,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A3-  أَعَارَتْ حَافِرًا means She (a mare) raised<br>\
and shifted a hoof; ―<br>\
-b2-  and hence, accord. to Az,<br>\
إِعَارَةُ الثِّيَابِ [The lending of garments] &amp;c. (L,<br>\
TA. [See 4 in art. عور.])<br>\
-A4-  And اعارهُ is also<br>\
said to signify He fattened him; namely, a horse:<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  and He plucked out the hair of his tail; like<br>\
أَعْرَاهُ: both of which meanings are mentioned by<br>\
IKtt and others: ―<br>\
-b3-  and i. q. ضَمَّرَهُ [He made<br>\
him lean, or light of flesh, &amp;c.]; from عَارَ “ he<br>\
went and came. ” (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
هُمْ يَتَعَيَّرُونَ مِنْ جِيرَانِهِمُ الأَمْتِعَةَ is said to<br>\
mean يَسْتَعِيرُونَ [i. e. They ask of their neighbours the loan of the household-goods, &amp;c.]: but<br>\
Az says that the word used by the Arabs is<br>\
يَتَعَيَّرُونَ. (TA. [See 10 in art. عور.])<br>\
6<br>\
تعايروا They blamed, upbraided, or reproached, one another; found fault, one with<br>\
another; i. q. تَعَايَبُوا, (S, O, Msb,) or عَيَّرَ بَعْضُهُمْ<br>\
بَعْضًا: (K:) or they reviled, or vilified, one another; syn. تَسَابُّوا. (AZ.)<br>\
10<br>\
استعار سَهْمًا مِنْ كِنَانَتِهِ: see art. عور.<br>\
عَارٌ A disgrace; a shame; a thing that occasions one&#39;s being reviled; a vice, or fault, or the<br>\
like; (S, O;) a thing for which one is, or is to<br>\
be, blamed, or dispraised; (B, in TA, art. عور;)<br>\
anything that necessarily occasions blame or reproach, (Msb, K,) or disgrace: (Msb:) pl. أَعْيَارٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ مَعَايِرُ, (S, O, K,) of which the sing.<br>\
is app. ↓ مَعْيَرَةٌ, (O,) [is syn. with أَعْيَارٌ, for it] signifies things for which one is, or is to be, blamed,<br>\
upbraided, reproached, or found fault with; syn.<br>\
مَعَايِبُ. (S, O, K.)<br>\
عَيْرٌ The ass; (S, O, Msb, K;) both the wild<br>\
and the domestic; (S, O, Msb;) its predominant<br>\
application is to the former: (K:) so called because he goes away hither and thither (يَعِيرُ<br>\
فَيَتَرَدَّدُ) in the desert: (TA:) fem. with ة: (S,<br>\
Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَعْيَارٌ, (S, O, Msb, K.) and<br>\
[of mult.] عِيَارٌ and عُيُورٌ (K) and عُيُورَةٌ (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K) and عِيَرَةٌ (O) and ↓ مَعْيُورَآءُ, (S, O, K,)<br>\
like مَشْيُوخَآءُ &amp;c., or this is [properly speaking] a<br>\
quasi-pl. n., (TA,) and ↓ مَعْيُورَى, [also a quasipl. n.,] (Az, TA,) and pl. pl. عِيَرَاتٌ (O) and<br>\
عِيَارَاتٌ. (K.) [Dim. عُيَيْرٌ, q. v. intra.] ―<br>\
-b2-  It is<br>\
said in a prov., relating to contentment with that<br>\
which is present and forgetting what is absent,<br>\
إِنْ ذَهَبَ العَيْرُ فَعَيْرٌ فِى الرِّبَاطِ [If the ass has gone<br>\
away, there is an ass in the tether]. (A &#39;Obeyd.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  You say also, of a place in which is no good,<br>\
هُوَ كَجَوْفِ عَيْرٍ [It is like the belly of an ass],<br>\
(S, TA,) or كجوف العَيْرِ [like the belly of the<br>\
ass]; (TA;) because there is nothing in his belly<br>\
of which any use is made: (S, TA:) or this<br>\
originated from the saying هُوَ أَخْلَى مِنْ جَوْفِ<br>\
حِمَارٍ [It is more empty than the valley of Himar];<br>\
(S, O, * TA;) for حمار was the name of a certain<br>\
unbeliever, who possessed a valley, which for his<br>\
infidelity, God rendered waste and unproductive;<br>\
(O, * TA;) and Imra-el-Keys, (O, TA,) as some<br>\
say, but correctly Taäbbata-sharrà, (O,) quoting<br>\
the above-mentioned saying, has substituted العير<br>\
for حمار, for the sake of the metre. (O, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  One says also أَذَلُّ مِنَ العَيْرِ More vile than<br>\
the ass. (TA.) [But this is doubtful: see the<br>\
same phrase expl. differently later in this paragraph. The wild ass is superior to every other<br>\
kind of animal that is an object of the chase: (see<br>\
فَرَأٌ:) and hence, app., the signification here next<br>\
following.] ―<br>\
-b5-  عَيْرٌ also signifies A lord, or chief,<br>\
(S, O, K,) of a people: (S, O:) a king: (K:)<br>\
pl. أَعْيَارٌ. (O.) ―<br>\
-b6-  The saying (S, K) of the people<br>\
of Syria, used by them proverbially, (TA,) عَيْرٌ<br>\
بِعَيْرٍ وَزِيَادَةُ عَشَرَةٍ [A lord for a lord, or a lord is<br>\
succeeded by a lord, and an increase of ten] is<br>\
expl. by the fact that, when the Khaleefeh of the<br>\
sons of Umeiyeh died, and another arose, he increased their stipends by ten dirhems: (S, O,<br>\
K:) so they said thus on that occasion. (O,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  عَيْرُ السَّرَاةِ is an appellation of A certain<br>\
bird, (S, O, K, TA,) resembling the pigeon, (S,<br>\
O, TA,) short in the legs, which are coved with<br>\
feathers, yellow in the legs and bill, having the<br>\
eye bordered with black, of a clear colour inclining<br>\
to greenness, or dark dust-colour, (خُضْرَة,) yellow<br>\
in the belly and the part beneath its wings and the<br>\
inner part of its tail; as though it were a variegated بُرْد: pl. عُيُورُ السَّرَاةِ: السَّرَاةُ being a place in<br>\
the district of Et-Táïf: they assert that this bird<br>\
eats three hundred figs, from the time of their<br>\
coming forth from among the leaves, small; and<br>\
in like manner, grapes. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The prominence, or ridge, in the middle of the iron head<br>\
or blade of an arrow or of a spear or of a sword<br>\
or of a knife or the like. (S, O.) [See ذُبَابٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  The prominent line, (S, O, TA,) like a little<br>\
wall, (TA,) in the middle of a leaf; its middle<br>\
rib. (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The spine, i. e. the prominent<br>\
part, in the middle of the scapula, or shoulderblade. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The prominent, or projecting,<br>\
bone in the middle of the hand: pl. أَعْيَارٌ. (TA.)<br>\
[In the K, it is expl. simply by العَظْمُ النَّاتِئُ<br>\
وَسَطَهَا: but this is a wrong reading, app. occasioned by an omission, which is supplied in the<br>\
TA, though somewhat awkwardly: it seems that<br>\
we should read وَمِنَ الكَفِّ العَظْمُ النَّتِئُ وَسَطَهَا;<br>\
or, more probably, ومن الكَتِفِ الخ; for I incline<br>\
to think that الكفّ in the TA is a mistake for<br>\
الكتف, and that the last signification of عير, given<br>\
here, is doubtful.] ―<br>\
-b5-  The prominence, or protuberance, in the upper, or convex, part, or back,<br>\
of the foot. (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Any prominent, or<br>\
protuberant, bone in the body. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  An edge,<br>\
or a ridge, of a rock, naturally prominent. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  Anything prominent, or protuberant, in an<br>\
even thing, (K,) or in the middle of an even thing<br>\
[or surface]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  Each of the two portions<br>\
of flesh and sinew next the back bone, one on either<br>\
side thereof: both together are called عَيْرَانِ. (K, *<br>\
TA.) [So called because it forms a kind of<br>\
ridge.] ―<br>\
-b10-  The prominent, or protuberant, part<br>\
at the pupil (بُؤْبُؤ) of the eye: (AA, TA:) or the<br>\
lid of the eye: (S, O, K:) or the inner angle [for<br>\
مَأٰقِى, in the CK, I read مَأْقَى, as in other copies<br>\
of the K,] of the eye: (Th, K:) or the image<br>\
that is seen in the black of the eye when a thing<br>\
faces it; (Aboo-Tálib, L, K; *) also called لُعْبَةٌ:<br>\
(Aboo-Tálib, L:) or the eye-ball: (TA:) or a<br>\
looking from the outer angle (لَحْظ [or perhaps<br>\
this signifies here the outer angle itself]) of the<br>\
eye. (K.) Hence the saying, (S, O,) فَعَلْتُ ذَاكَ<br>\
قَبْلَ عَيْرٍ وَمَا جَرَى I did that before a look from<br>\
the outer angle of the eye: (S, O, K: *) or before<br>\
he winked [or could wink]; عير meaning the<br>\
“ image that is seen in the black of the eye; ”<br>\
and ما جرى, “what moved,” i. e., “the eye<br>\
itself: ” (Aboo-Tálib:) or before I looked [or<br>\
could look] at thee; not used with a negative:<br>\
(Th:) nor do you say أَفْعَلُ ذاك [instead of فعلت<br>\
ذاك in this phrase]: (A O, S:) or عير here signifies the wild ass. (Lh.) You say also أَتَيْتُكَ قَبْلَ<br>\
عَيْرٍ وَمَا جَرَى, meaning I came to thee before a<br>\
sleeper awoke [or could awake]. (AA, TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-<br>\
The وَتِد [or tragus] which is in the inner part of<br>\
the ear: (S:) [see وَتِدٌ:] or the part of the interior of the ear which is below the فَرْع [or upper<br>\
portion thereof], (K,) in a man and in a horse,<br>\
like the عَيْر [of the head] of an arrow: (TA:) or<br>\
the عَيْرَانِ are the مَتْنَانِ [app. meaning the two<br>\
backs, though the word may have some other application in this case,] of the two ears of a horse:<br>\
pl. عِيَارٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  A wooden pin, peg, or stake,<br>\
which is fixed in the ground or in a wall. (S, O,<br>\
K.) Hence, as some say, the prov. فُلَانٌ أَذَلُّ مِنَ<br>\
العَيْرِ [Such a one is more vile than the wooden pin,<br>\
or peg, of a tent &amp;c.]. (TA.) [See another explanation above: and see also مَذَلَّةٌ.] Hence also,<br>\
accord. to some, (TA,) one says, مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ مَنْ<br>\
ضَرَبَ العَيْرَ هُوَ, meaning I known not what one of<br>\
mankind is he. (Yaakoob, S, O, K, TA.) And<br>\
hence too, as some say, the saying of El-Hárith<br>\
Ibn-Hillizeh, (O, TA,)<br>\
زَعَمُوا أَنَّ كُلَّ مَنْ ضَرَبَ العَيْ<br>\
رَ مَوَالٍ لَنَا وَأَنَّا الوَلَآءُ<br>\
of which Aboo-&#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;Alà said that he had<br>\
passed away, or died, who knew the meaning of<br>\
this verse, (S, O, TA,) and which is differently<br>\
related, some saying مَوَالٍ لَهَا, and some saying<br>\
الوِلَآءُ: (TA:) but various meanings are assigned<br>\
to العير in this instance; and some expl. it as a<br>\
proper name: (O, TA:) and some, relating this<br>\
verse, say العِيرَ [q. v.]: (TA:) [the following<br>\
explanation of the verse has been given as preferable to others:] They (the Arákim, mentioned<br>\
two verses before,) have asserted that all who have<br>\
hunted the wild ass are the sons of our paternal<br>\
uncles, and that we are the relations of them;<br>\
الولآء being for أَصْحَابُ وَلَائِهِمْ: meaning that we<br>\
are responsible for their crimes, or offences, as<br>\
though we were their heirs. (EM p. 261.)<br>\
-A4-<br>\
Also A certain piece of wood which is in the fore<br>\
part of the [vehicle called] هَوْدَج. (O, K.)<br>\
-A5-<br>\
And A drum. (O, K.) And so, as some say, in<br>\
the verse cited above. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A6-  And A mountain. (K.) And also the name of A mountain of<br>\
El-Medeeneh: (K, TA:) and, as some say, of a<br>\
mountain of Mekkeh. (TA.)<br>\
-A7-  And الأَعْيَارُ (of<br>\
which the sing. is العَيْرُ, TA) is a name of Certain<br>\
bright stars in the track of the feet of سُهَيْل [or<br>\
Canopus]. (O, K.)<br>\
عِيرٌ A caravan; syn. قَافِلَةٌ; of the fem. gen.:<br>\
(K:) from عَارَ “ he journeyed: ” (TA:) or camels<br>\
that carry provision of corn: (S, Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
K:) then generally applied to any caravan: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) or a caravan of asses; and then extended<br>\
to any caravan; as though pl. of عَيْرٌ, being originally and regularly of the measure فُعُلٌ, [i. e.<br>\
عُيُرٌ,] like سُقُفٌ as pl. of سَقْفٌ; (TA;) but it has<br>\
no proper sing.: (K:) or any beasts upon which<br>\
provision of corn is brought, whether camels or<br>\
asses or mules: (K:) the عير mentioned in the<br>\
Kur xii. 94 consisted of asses; and the assertion<br>\
of him who says that عير is applied specially to<br>\
camels is false: (AHeyth, O, TA:) Nuseyr cites<br>\
the poet Aboo-&#39;Amr El-Asadee as applying this<br>\
appellation to asses; and says that camels are<br>\
not so called unless employed for bringing provision of corn: (AHeyth, TA:) IAar says that<br>\
it is applied to camels bearing burdens, and not<br>\
bearing burdens: (Az:) but camels are not thus<br>\
called that bring corn for their owners: (TA,<br>\
voce رِكَاب:) pl. عِيَرَاتٌ, (O, K,) with ا and ت<br>\
because it is of the fem. gender, and, being a<br>\
subst., with the ى movent, accord. to the dial.<br>\
of Hudheyl, for they say جَوْزَاتٌ and بَيْضَاتٌ;<br>\
(Sb;) and عِيْرَاتٌ (S, K) is allowable, (S,) and is<br>\
the regular form, and occurs in a trad., meaning<br>\
horses or the like, and camels carrying merchandise. (TA.)<br>\
عَيْرَانٌ applied to a he-camel, (O,) and عَيْرَانَةٌ<br>\
applied to a she-camel, (S, O, K,) Resembling the<br>\
[wild] ass (العَيْر) in quickness and briskness: (S,<br>\
O:) or the latter, swift, with briskness; (K, TA;)<br>\
so termed because of her frequent going round<br>\
about [or to and fro], rather than as being<br>\
likened to the [wild] ass: and also hard, or<br>\
hardy. (TA.)<br>\
عِيرَانٌ: see عَائِرٌ in art. عور.<br>\
عِيَارٌ and ↓ مِعْيَارٌ are syn.; (S;) both signify [A<br>\
standard of measure or weight;] a thing with<br>\
which another thing is measured, or compared,<br>\
and equalized; (Mgh;) [and with which it is<br>\
assayed:] or a thing with which measures of<br>\
capacity are measured, compared, or equalized:<br>\
(Lth:) the عِيَار of a thing is that which is made,<br>\
or appointed, a standard thereof, by which to<br>\
regulate or adjust it; expl. by مَا جُعِلَ نِظَامًا لَهُ.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The عِيَار of dirhems, and of deenárs,<br>\
is [The rate, or standard, of fineness;] the quantity of pure silver, and of pure gold, that is put<br>\
into them. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  [See also 1.]<br>\
عِيَارَةٌ Currency of a poem. (K.)<br>\
عُيَيْرٌ [dim. of عَيْرٌ]. You say, فُلَانٌ عُيَيْرُ وَحْدِهِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Such a one is a person who is pleased with his<br>\
own opinion; (S, O, K;) an expression of dispraise; (S;) like as نَسِيجُ وَحْدِهِ is one of praise:<br>\
(TA:) or a person who does not consult others,<br>\
nor mix with them, yet in whom is ignobleness and<br>\
weakness; as also جُحَيْشُ وَحْدِهِ [q. v.]: (Az:)<br>\
or a person who eats by himself. (Th, K.) You<br>\
may also say عِيَيْرٌ, like شِيَيْخٌ for شُيَيْخٌ; but you<br>\
should not say عُوَيْر, nor شُوَيْخ. (S, O.)<br>\
عَيِّرٌ: see عَائِرٌ.<br>\
عَيَّارٌ: see the next paragraph, in five places.<br>\
عَائِرٌ That goes to and fro, and round about;<br>\
as also ↓ عَيَّارٌ: both are applied [to a man and]<br>\
also to a dog: (TA:) and ↓ the latter is also<br>\
expl. as follows: a man (TA) often coming and<br>\
going (K, TA) in the land: (TA:) often going<br>\
round about, (Fr, S, Msb, K,) often in motion,<br>\
(Fr, S, Msb,) and sharp, or quick, of intellect:<br>\
(S, K:) it is used as an epithet of praise and as<br>\
one of dispraise: for instance, applied to a boy,<br>\
it signifies brisk in obeying God, and brisk in acts<br>\
of disobedience: (IAar:) and ↓ عَيِّرٌ, applied to a<br>\
horse, signifies brisk, lively, or sprightly: (IAar:)<br>\
and ↓ عَيَّارٌ, so applied, mischievous; and that is<br>\
brisk, lively, or sprightly, so that he goes on one<br>\
side of the way, and then turns to the other side:<br>\
(TA:) and, applied to a man, that goes to and<br>\
fro without work: (Ajnás en-Nátifee, Mgh:) or<br>\
that leaves himself to follow his natural desire, not<br>\
restraining himself. (IAmb, Mgh, Msb.) It is<br>\
said in a prov., كَلْبٌ عَائِرٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ أَسَدٍ رَابِضٍ A<br>\
dog going to and fro and round about is better [as<br>\
a guard] than a lion lying down. (TA.) You say<br>\
also شَاةٌ عَائِرَةٌ A sheep that goes to and fro between<br>\
two flocks, not knowing which of them to follow:<br>\
to such is a hypocrite likened. (TA.) And نَاقَةٌ<br>\
عَائِرَةٌ A she-camel that goes forth from the other<br>\
camels in order that the stallion may cover her<br>\
(S, O, TA.) And جَمَلٌ عَائِرٌ A he-camel that<br>\
leaves the females seven months gone with young,<br>\
and goes to others. (S.) And بأَوْصَالٍ ↓ عَيَّارٌ A<br>\
horse that goes away hither and thither, by reason<br>\
of his sprightliness: (S, O:) or a lion that goes<br>\
away with the joints, or whole bones. of men to<br>\
his thicket. (IB.) ↓ العَيَّارُ is an appellation given<br>\
to The lion, (S, O, K,) because of his coming and<br>\
going in search of his prey. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  قَصِيدَةٌ<br>\

مَا قَالَتِ العَرَبُ بَيْتًا أَعْيَرَ مِنْهُ The Arabs have not<br>\
uttered a verse more current than it. (A, O, TA.)<br>\
مُعَارٌ A horse, (S, K,) and a dog, (K.) made<br>\
to go away as though he had escaped. or got loose:<br>\
(K:) or made to escape: (TA:) or made to<br>\
escape, or get loose, and go away hither and<br>\
thither, by reason of his exceeding sprightliness.<br>\
(S.) It is also expl. as signifying, applied to a<br>\
horse, Fattened: and having the hair of is tail<br>\
plucked out: these two explanations mentioned<br>\
by IKtt and others: and made lean, or light of<br>\
flesh. (TA. [See 4, last sentence.]) See also the<br>\
next paragraph.<br>\
مِعَارٌ, (O, K,) as though originally مِعْيَرٌ, from<br>\
عَارَ, aor. يَعِيرُ, (Az, O,) A horse that turns away<br>\
from the road with his rider. (O, K.) Hence<br>\
the saying of Bishr Ibn-Abee-Házim, (K,) or<br>\
Kházim, as written by Sgh, (TA,) not Et-Tirimmáh, J having made a mistake [in ascribing it<br>\
to him (but in one of my copies of the S it is<br>\
ascribed to Bishr Ibn-Abee-Házim and in the<br>\
other to a poet unnamed)],<br>\
أَحَقُّ الخَيْلِ بِالرَّكْضِ المِعَارُ<br>\
[The most deserving, of horses, of being urged to<br>\
run by the striking with the foot is he that turns<br>\
away from the road with his rider]. (K.) Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Obeyd, (so in my copies of the S,) or Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Obeydeh, (so in the K and TA,) says that the<br>\
people, in relating this, say ↓ المُعَارُ, [deriving it]<br>\
from العَارِيَّة; which is a mistake: (S, K, TA:)<br>\
the truth being that this is a mistake as to the<br>\
damm and the derivation; which is the saying of<br>\
IAar alone, and is mentioned by IB also:<br>\
(TA:) or the last word is المُغَارُ. (TA in<br>\
art. غور, q. v.)<br>\
نَصْلٌ مُعْيَرٌ An iron head or blade, of an arrow<br>\
or of a spear or of a sword or of a knife or the<br>\
like, having what is termed عَيْرٌ. (AHn, from AA.)<br>\

more probably مُعْيَرَةٌ and مُعَيَّرَةٌ,] A كَفّ [or hand]<br>\
having what is so termed. (TA. [But I think that<br>\
كَفٌّ is here a mistranscription for كَتِفٌ: see<br>\
عَيْرٌ.])<br>\
اِبْنَةُ مِعْيَرٍ Calamity, (K, TA,) and hardship.<br>\
(TA.) And بَنَاتُ مِعْيَرٍ Calamities. (S, O, TA,)<br>\
