عَدَسَ فِى الأَرْضِ, (AA, S, O, K,) aor.<br>\
عَدِسَ,<br>\
inf. n. عَدْسٌ (AA, O, K) and عَدَسَانٌ and عِدَاسٌ<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K) and عُدُوسٌ, (O, K,) He went<br>\
away [or journeyed] into, or in, or through, the<br>\
country, or land. (AA, S, O, K.) One says,<br>\
عَدَسَتْ بِهِ المَنِيَّةُ (S, O) i. e. [Death] took him<br>\
away. (O.) And El-Kumeyt says,<br>\
أُكَلِّفُهَا هَوْلَ الظَّلَامِ وَلَمْ أَزَلْ<br>\
↓ إِلَىَّ وَعَادِسَا ↓ أَخَا اللَّيْلِ مَعْدُوسًا<br>\
or عَلَىَّ, as some relate it, (O, [and thus, instead<br>\
of إِلَىَّ, in one of my copies of the S,]) meaning<br>\
[I constrain them (referring to camels mentioned<br>\
in a preceding verse) to bear the terror of the<br>\
darkness, and I cease not to be, as a nightfarer,]<br>\
journeyed to by night [and journeying]. (S, O.)<br>\
[It is added in the S, as though to indicate<br>\
another meaning, وَعَدَسَ لُغَةٌ فِى حَدَسَ; and in<br>\
the O and K, وَالعَدْسُ الحَدْسُ; (in the O with<br>\
أَيْضًا between these two inf. ns.;) but accord. to<br>\
the TA, the meaning intended by this is, The<br>\
going away into, or in, the country, or land: see,<br>\
however, what here follows.] ―<br>\
-b2-  العَدْسُ also signifies The treading hard, or vehemently, (شِدَّةُ<br>\
الوَطْءِ, S, O, K, TA,) upon the ground; and so<br>\
الحَدْسُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And i. q. الكَدْحُ [app. as<br>\
meaning The working, or labouring; or toiling,<br>\
or labouring hard]; (S, O, K, TA;) as also<br>\
الحَدْسُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And, accord. to IKtt, عَدَسَ,<br>\
said of a man, signifies قَوِىَ عَلَى الشَّرِّ [He was<br>\
strong to do evil, or mischief: but I think it probable that the right explanation is, على السَّيْرِ or<br>\
على السُّرَى, i. e. to journey, or to journey by<br>\
night: see عَدُوسٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَدَسَ, aor.<br>\
عَدِسَ,<br>\
(AA, O, K,) inf. n. عَدْسٌ, (TA,) also signifies<br>\
He served [another]; syn. خَدَمَ. (AA, O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And عَدَسَ المَالَ, inf. n. عَدْسٌ, He pastured<br>\
the cattle, or camels &amp;c. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K,<br>\
TA.) And هُوَ يَعْدِسُ عَلَيْهِ He pastures for him.<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.)<br>\
-A3-  عَدَسَ بِهِ, (O, K,) and عَدَسَهُ,<br>\
(IKtt, * O,) He said to him (i. e. to a mule, O)<br>\
عَدَسْ [q. v.]. (IKtt, O, K.)<br>\
-A4-  عُدِسَ, He had<br>\
an eruption of the small pustule called عَدَسَة<br>\
[q. v.]. (K, * O, * TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
عادس He journeyed continually. (Freytag,<br>\
from the Deewán of Jereer.)]<br>\
عَدَسْ A cry by which one chides a mule, (IDrd,<br>\
S, IKtt, * O, K,) to urge him: (IKtt:) sometimes, by poetic license, it is made decl.: (L,<br>\
TA:) the vulgar say عد [app. عَدْ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, (TA,) sometimes, (S, O,) it is also used<br>\
as a name for The mule; (S, O, K;) like as the<br>\
ass is [sometimes] called سَأْ سَأْ, which is [origiginally] a cry whereby one chides an ass; and<br>\
there are other instances of the same kind. (TA.)<br>\
عَدَسٌ [Lentils;] a well-known grain; (S, O,<br>\
K;) also called عَلَسٌ and بُلُسٌ: (TA:) n. un.<br>\
with ة. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَدَسُ المَآءِ A certain plant<br>\
[of which I have not found any description].<br>\
(See art. ساذج, last sentence.)<br>\
عَدَسَةٌ A small pustule, (Lth, S, * O, * K,) resembling the عَدَسة [commonly so called, i. e. the<br>\
single grain of lentil], (Lth, TA,) which comes<br>\
forth (Lth, O, K) in the body (Lth, K) in a man,<br>\
(S, O,) dispersedly, like the طَاعُون [or plague],<br>\
(Lth, TA,) of which it is said to be a kind, (Lth,<br>\
O, TA,) and kills, (Lth, O, K,) or sometimes<br>\
kills, (S,) or generally kills, (Lth, TA,) few recovering from it: (Lth, O:) it was feared by the<br>\
tribe of Kureysh, as being transitive. (O.)<br>\
[<br>\
عَدَسِيَّةٌ A soup made by boiling yellow lentils in<br>\
water, till nearly dissolved, and then adding red<br>\
vinegar, coriander, and salt. (Ibn-Jezleh, quoted,<br>\
from Channing, by Greenhill, in his Transl. of<br>\
Er-Rázee on Small-pox and Measles.)<br>\
-A2-  It is<br>\
now applied also to Bats&#39; dung; which is used<br>\
in medicine, administered internally; and also<br>\
applied externally, mixed with vinegar, to tumours: so says Forskål in his Descr. Animalium,<br>\
p. iii.: but he there states عدسيه to be an appel-lation of the bat itself.]<br>\
عَدُوسٌ, applied to a female, [and app. to a<br>\
male also,] Bold, or daring; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,<br>\
K, TA;) strong to journey. (TA.) And عَدُوسُ<br>\

as meaning strong to journey by night, is applied<br>\
to a man and to a woman and to a camel.<br>\
