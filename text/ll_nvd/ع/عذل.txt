عَذَلَهُ, (S, Msb,) aor.<br>\
عَذُلَ (S, O, Msb) and<br>\
عَذِلَ,<br>\
(Msb,) inf. n. عَذْلٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) He blamed<br>\
him, or censured him; (S, O, Msb, K; *) [and<br>\
↓ عذّلهُ he did so much; for] تَعْذِيلٌ is like عَذْلٌ,<br>\
signifying مَلَامَةٌ, (K, TA,) [and تَعْذَالٌ is a dial.<br>\
var. thereof, occurring in the Mo&#39;allakah of Imra-el-Keys, (see EM p. 33,)] but its verb has<br>\
teshdeed to denote muchness. (TA.) سَبَقَ السَّيْفُ<br>\
العَذْلَ [The sword preceded the censure] is a prov.<br>\
[expl. voce شَجْنٌ]. (TA.) Accord. to IAar,<br>\
[عَذَلَهُ may signify as above; or he afflicted,<br>\
annoyed, or hurt, him; for he says,] العَذْلُ<br>\
signifies الإِحْرَاقُ; [perhaps meaning الإِحْرَاقُ<br>\
بِاللِّسَانِ; for SM adds,] as though the censurer<br>\
burned (يُحْرِقُ) by his عَذْل the object thereof:<br>\
(TA:) [or it may mean also he burned him; for<br>\
Sgh says,] and العَذْلُ signifies also الإِحْرَاقُ. (O.)<br>\
2<br>\
عَذَّلَ see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
5<br>\
تَعَذَّلَ see 8, in two places.<br>\
6<br>\
تَعَاْذَلَ [تعاذلوا They blamed, or censured, one<br>\
another]. See the last sentence in this art.<br>\
8<br>\
اعتذل He blamed, or censured, himself: (S,<br>\
O, Msb:) or i. q. قَبِلَ المَلَامَةَ [he admitted, or<br>\
accepted, blame, or censure]; as also ↓ تعذّل:<br>\
(K:) [or, accord. to SM,] one says, اعتذل الرَّجُلَ<br>\
and ↓ تعذّل as meaning قَبِلَ مِنْهُ المَلَامَةَ وَأَعْتَبَ<br>\
[i. e. he admitted, or accepted, blame, or censure,<br>\
from the man, and reverted; but I think that<br>\
the right reading is الرَّجُلُ, and that منه should<br>\
be erased]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He shot, or cast, a<br>\
second time; (ISk, O, K;) having shot, or cast,<br>\
and missed: (ISk, O:) or, accord. to the A, he<br>\
blamed himself for having missed, and therefore<br>\
shot, or cast, a second time, and hit. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And i. q. اِعْتَزَمَ [perhaps said of a man, and<br>\
meaning He kept to the course, or right course, in<br>\
running, or walking, &amp;c.: but more probably, I<br>\
think, said of a horse, meaning he went along<br>\
overcoming his rider, in his running, not complying with his desire when he pulled him in]: (K:)<br>\
accord. to AA, said of a horse as meaning he<br>\
went quickly, after slowness, and strove, or exerted<br>\
himself. (O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And اعتذل يَوْمُنَا (assumed tropical:)  Our day became intensely hot; as though it had been remiss,<br>\
and made amends for its remissness by excess,<br>\
blaming itself for what had proceeded from it.<br>\
(A, TA.)<br>\
عَذَلٌ Blame, or censure: a subst., as distinguished from the inf. n. عَذْلٌ. (O, K.)<br>\
أَيَّامٌ عُذُلٌ: see مُعْتَذِلَاتٌ, in two places.<br>\
عُذَلَةٌ One who blames, or censures, others much<br>\
or often; (S, O, K;) an epithet like ضُحَكَةٌ and<br>\
هُزَأَةٌ; (S;) [and ↓ عَذُولٌ is used in the same<br>\
sense, agreeably with analogy, but is perhaps<br>\
post-classical;] as also ↓ عَذَّالٌ; (K;) and this<br>\
last with ة is applied in this sense to a woman.<br>\
(TA.) Hence the prov., أَنَا عُذَلَةٌ وَأَخِى خُذَلَةٌ<br>\
وَكِلَانَا لَيْسَ بِابْنِ أَمَةٍ [lit. I am one who blames<br>\
others much, and my brother is one who constantly<br>\
abstains from rendering aid, and neither of us is<br>\
a son of a female slave; but expl. as] meaning I<br>\
blame my brother, and he abstains from aiding<br>\
me. (TA.)<br>\
عَذُولٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
عَذَّالٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
عَذَّالَةٌ A man who blames, or censures, [very]<br>\
much or often: the ة is added to render it [more]<br>\
intensive. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also fem. of عَذَّالٌ, q. v.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And العَذَّالَةُ is an appellation of The اِسْت<br>\
[i. e. the podex, or the anus]. (O, K.)<br>\
عَاذِلٌ Blaming, or censuring; or a blamer, or<br>\
censurer: (TA:) pl. عَذَلَةٌ and عُذَّالٌ and عُذَّلٌ;<br>\
(K, TA;) all pls. of عَاذِلٌ: the fem., applied to<br>\
a woman, is عَاذِلَةٌ; and the pl. of this is عَوَاذِلُ,<br>\
and عَاذِلَاتٌ is allowable. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And العَاذِلُ<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  The vein from which flows the blood<br>\
called that of الاِسْتِحَاضة [inf. n. of اُسْتُحِيضَتْ,<br>\
q. v., in art. حيض]; (S, O, Msb, K, TA;) as<br>\
though it were so called because the woman becomes liable to be blamed by her husband; the<br>\
blaming being attributed to the vein by reason<br>\
of its being the cause thereof: (O:) and sometimes it is called العَاذِرُ [q. v.]: (Msb, TA: *) the<br>\
pl. is عُذُلٌ, like شُرُفٌ pl. of شَارِفٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
عَاذِلٌ was The name of [the month] شَعْبَانُ in the<br>\
Time of Ignorance: (K, * TA:) or of شَوَّالٌ;<br>\
(K, TA;) but the former has been pronounced<br>\
to be the right: (TA:) [see شَهْرٌ:] the pl. is<br>\
عَوَاذِلُ. (K, TA.)<br>\
مُعَذَّلٌ A man much blamed, or censured, for<br>\
his excessive munificence. (S, O, K. *)<br>\
أَيَّامٌ مُعْتَذِلَاتٌ (tropical:)  Intensely hot days; (S, O, K,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ عُذُلٌ; (K;) as though they<br>\
blamed one another; one saying to another, “I<br>\
am hotter than thou, and why is not thy heat<br>\
like my heat? ” (TA:) or, accord. to IAar,<br>\
↓ العُذُلُ signifies the hot days. (O.) And<br>\
مُعْتَذِلَاتُ سُهَيْلٍ (tropical:)  Certain intensely hot days that<br>\
come before the [auroral] rising of Suheyl [i. e.<br>\
Canopus], or after it; so called as [though]<br>\
meaning that they blame one another (↓ يَتَعَاذَلْنَ),<br>\
and bid one another to be intensely hot or to<br>\
desist from heat: and also called مُعْتَدِلَات [q. v.],<br>\
with the unpointed د, as being equal in intensity<br>\
of heat. (TA.)<br>\
