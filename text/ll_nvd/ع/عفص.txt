(Msb;) the produce of the tree called بَلُّوط [or<br>\
oak]: (L, TA:) or applied to the trees [which<br>\
bear it] and to the fruit [thereof]: (K:) or a<br>\
certain tree of the kind called بَلُّوط, which [is also<br>\
the name of a produce of that tree, i. e., of the<br>\
acorn, (both of which applications are agreeable<br>\
with modern usage,) like as عَفْصٌ is also the name<br>\
of another produce thereof, i. e., the gall, or gallnut; for it is said that this tree] bears one year<br>\
بَلُّوط, and another year عَفْص, (Lth, O, K,) of<br>\
which ink is made: (CK:) it is not of the growth<br>\
of the land of the Arabs: (IB, TA:) it is astringent; drying; having the quality of repelling<br>\
effluent matters; and strengthening flaccid and<br>\
weak members; (K, TA;) and especially the<br>\
teeth; (TA;) and when steeped in vinegar, it<br>\
blackens the hair: (K:) the word is post-classical;<br>\
(S, O, K;) not of the language of the people of<br>\
the desert: (S, IF, O, Msb:) or it is Arabic;<br>\
(AHn, O, K;) and from it is derived ↓ عُفُوصَةٌ,<br>\
signifying “ a taste in which is astringency and<br>\
bitterness; ” as also the epithet ↓ عَفِصٌ, applied<br>\
to a taste. (AHn, O.)<br>\
عَفَصٌ A twisting in the nose: (O, K:) so they<br>\
say. (O.)<br>\
عَفِصٌ A taste (AHn, S, O, Msb) having an<br>\
astringent quality, (AHn, S, O, Msb, K,) and<br>\
bitterness, (AHn, O, K,) which render swallowing<br>\
difficult; (TA;) disagreeable and choking; or disagreeable, with dryness and bitterness; or rough;<br>\
syn. بَشِعٌ. (TA.) See عَفْصٌ.<br>\
عَفْصِىٌّ [app. A seller of عَفْص, or galls. Five<br>\
relaters of traditions of whom each bore this<br>\
appellation are mentioned in the TA.]<br>\
عِفَاصٌ The receptacle in which is put money or<br>\
the like that one expends, (A&#39;Obeyd, Az, A, Mgh,<br>\
O, Msb, K,) or, as some say, in which is the pastor&#39;s money or the like that he expends, (TA,)<br>\
made of skin, or of a piece of rag, or other material. (A&#39;Obeyd, Az, A, * Mgh, O, Msb, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And hence, (A&#39;Obeyd, O, Az, &amp;c.,) The skin with<br>\
which the head of a flask, or bottle, is covered:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, Az, S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K:) it is said<br>\
to be its صِمَام [or stopper]; (Az, Mgh, O, Msb;)<br>\
by Lth; (Az, O, Msb;) but the right explanation is that given by A &#39;Obeyd: (Az, Msb:) that<br>\
which enters into its mouth is the صِمَام: (S:) or<br>\
it has this latter signification also: (A:) or it<br>\
signifies accord. to El-Ghooree, (Mgh,) or signifies also, (A, K,) the case (غِلَاف [which has<br>\
app. been misunderstood as meaning the skin<br>\
cover of the head of a flask or bottle, before<br>\
mentioned.]) of a flask, or bottle: (A, Mgh, O,<br>\
K:) but the first is the explanation that is preferred. (Mgh.) [See 1, first signification.)<br>\
عُفُوصَةٌ in taste, (S,) Astringency (S, K) and<br>\
bitterness, (K,) which render swallowing difficult:<br>\
(TA:) a taste in which is astringency and bitterness: derived from عَفْصٌ, q. v. (AHn, O.) [See<br>\
also عَفِصٌ.]<br>\
مُعَفَّصٌ A garment, or piece of cloth, dyed with<br>\
عَفْص [or galls]. (O, K.)<br>\
