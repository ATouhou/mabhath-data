↓ عَصْفَةٌ and ↓ عَصِيفَةٌ and ↓ عُصَافَةٌ: or the leaves,<br>\

different senses it is expl. as used in the Kur<br>\
lv. 11: (TA:) or it there means the stalk, or<br>\
stem, of corn: (Fr, S voce رَيْحَانٌ:) or straw;<br>\
(Jel, TA;) and so الزَّرْعِ ↓ عَصِيفُ; (M voce<br>\

voce تِبْنٌ:) and عُصُوفٌ signifies straws: (IAar,<br>\

(Bd in lv. 11:) or corn, or seed-produce, or<br>\
barley, cut while green, for fodder; syn. قَصِيلٌ:<br>\

ears, themselves, of corn: and the pl. is عُصُوفٌ.<br>\
(TA.) كَعَصْفٍ مَأْكُولٍ, in the Kur [cv. last<br>\
verse], means Like corn of which the grain has<br>\
been eaten and the straw thereof remains: (El-<br>\
Hasan El-Basree, S, O, K:) or like leaves of which<br>\
the contents have been taken and which remain<br>\
without any grain therein: (O, K:) or like عَصْف,<br>\
(O,) or leaves, (K,) which the beasts have eaten:<br>\
(O, K:) or, as Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Jubeyr is related to<br>\
have said, like barley growing or growing forth<br>\
[that has been eaten]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And IAar says,<br>\
(O, TA,) [the pl.] عُصُوفٌ, (O, K, TA,) with<br>\
damm to the ع, (TA,) [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
عَصُوف,] signifies Handfuls of reaped corn; syn.<br>\

as from the K, خمر.])<br>\

strong puff, of wind. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] (assumed tropical:)  The odour,<br>\
(K,) or fragrance (فَغْمَة) of odour, (Z, TA,) or<br>\
exhaled odour, (IF, O,) of wine: (IF, Z, O, K,<br>\

that has been trodden, or thrashed, and cut].<br>\

applied to a she-ostrich, and to a she-camel (S,<br>\
O, K, TA) that goes swiftly with her rider; (S,<br>\
O, TA;) likened to the wind in the swiftness of<br>\
her course: (Z, TA:) pl. عُصُفٌ: (TA:) and<br>\

intensive meaning] (S, O, K) [and ↓ عَصِيفٌ as<br>\
used in “ Fákihet el-Khulafà ” p. 196 line 18 but<br>\
not found by me in this sense in any lexicon] and<br>\

violent blowing of the wind therein, (Fr, O,<br>\
Msb,) عَاصِفٌ in this case being an instance of<br>\
فَاعِلٌ in the sense of مَفْعُولٌ فِيهِ, (S, O,) like as<br>\
one says يَوْمٌ بَارِدٌ, (Fr, O,) or like لَيْلٌ نَائِمٌ; the<br>\
meaning being, A day in which the wind blows<br>\
violently, or vehemently: (S, O:) this is the meaning in the phrase فِى يَوْمٍ عَاصِفٍ (Fr, O, K) in<br>\
the Kur [xiv. 21]: or this phrase may mean<br>\
فِى يَوْمٍ عَاصِفِ الرِّيحِ [in a day violent, or vehement, in respect of the wind], because the wind is<br>\
mentioned in the former part of the sentence.<br>\
(Fr, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also عَصُوفٌ. ―<br>\
-b4-  عَاصِفٌ also signifies (tropical:)  An arrow turning aside, or declining, from<br>\
