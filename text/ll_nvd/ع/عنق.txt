with the same inf. n., and expl. as meaning He<br>\
was, or became, long and thick in the neck.]) ―<br>\

عنّق عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. تَعْنِيقٌ, He went along and<br>\

cake of bread from beneath a jar belonging to<br>\
her, and she had taken it from between its jaws,<br>\
مَا كَانَ يَنْبَغِى لَكِ أَنْ تُعَنِّقِيهَا i. e. [It did not behoove thee] that thou shouldst take hold of its neck<br>\
and squeeze it: or the meaning is, that thou<br>\
shouldst disappoint it; (O, K;) from عنّقهُ signifying he disappointed him; (K;) which is from<br>\
العَنَاقُ: (O:) or, as some relate it, he said ان<br>\
تُعَنِّكِيهَا, (O, K,) i. e., that thou shouldst distress it,<br>\
and treat it roughly: (O:) and تُعَنِّفِيَهَا, with ف,<br>\

signifying the pace thus termed. (Mgh.) In the<br>\
phrase أَعْنَقَ لِيَمُوتَ, (Mgh,) occurring in a trad.,<br>\
(O,) the ل is used causatively: [i. e., the phrase<br>\

تعنّق said of the jerboa, It entered its hole called<br>\

stretching pace, of the horse or the like, and of<br>\
camels: (S, O, K, TA:) or a pace with wide<br>\
steps: (Mgh:) or a certain quick pace, with<br>\

which it is implied that these two have all the<br>\
significations assigned by its author to عُنُقٌ and<br>\
عُنْقٌ,]) but [SM says] none of the leading lexicologists has mentioned these two, in what I have<br>\
seen, (TA,) [adding that he had found in the O<br>\
العَنِيقُ as meaning العَنَقُ, which he supposes the<br>\
author of the K to have thought to be العُنُقُ,]<br>\
The neck; i. e. the part that forms a connection<br>\
between the head and the body; (TA;) i. q. رَقَبَةٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) or i. q. جِيدٌ: (K:) [but see these two<br>\
words:] masc. and fem.; (S, O, K;) generally<br>\
masc., (IB, Msb, * TA,) but in the dial. of El-<br>\
Hijáz fem.; (Msb;) or, as some say, ↓ عُنْقٌ is<br>\
masc., and عُنُقٌ is fem.: (TA:) the pl. (i. e. of<br>\

passed over thee?] and he answered, أَخَذْتُ بِعُنُقِ<br>\

preceders to Paradise; from the saying لَهُ عُنُقٌ<br>\
فِى الخَيْرِ he has precedence in that which is good:<br>\
so says Th: another, that they shall be forgiven to<br>\
the extent of the prolonging of their voice: another,<br>\
that they shall be given an addition above other men:<br>\
another, that they shall be in a state of happiness<br>\
and sprightliness, raising the eyes and looking in<br>\
expectation; for permission will have been given<br>\

[for مُغْرِبَةٌ, meaning A calamity carried him off<br>\
or away; lit., soared with him]; and [in like<br>\
manner] طَارَتْ بِهِ العَنْقَآءُ: (S, O:) [see also art.<br>\

a certain bird, of which the name is known, but<br>\
the body is unknown: (S, O, K:) [or it is a<br>\
fabulous bird:] AHát says, in the Book of Birds,<br>\
العَنْقَآءُ المُغْرِبَةُ means calamity; and not any of<br>\
the birds that we know: IDrd says, عَنْقَآءُ مُغْرِبٌ<br>\
is a phrase for which there is no foundation: it is<br>\
said to mean a great bird that is not seen save<br>\
[once] in ages; and by frequency of usage it became a name for calamity: (O:) it is also said<br>\
to be called عنقآء because it has in its neck a<br>\
whiteness like the neck-ring: Kr says that they<br>\
assert it to be a bird that is found at the place of<br>\
the setting of the sun: Zj, that it is a bird that<br>\
no one has seen: some say that it is meant in the<br>\
Kur cv. 3: and some, that it is the eagle: (TA:)<br>\
it is called in Pers. سِيمُرْغ: (MA:) and it is<br>\
mentioned also in art. غرب [q. v.]. (K.) [See<br>\
also my translation of the Thousand and One<br>\

(O, K:) or العَنْقَآءُ المُغْرِبُ signifies the summit of<br>\
an أَكَمَة on the highest part of a tall, or long,<br>\
mountain: so says Aboo-Málik, who denies that<br>\
it means a bird. (TA in art. غرب.) And عَنْقَآءُ<br>\
applied to a [hill, or mountain, such as is termed]<br>\
هَضْبَة signifies High and long. (TA. [And a<br>\

termed ↓ مِعْنَاقٌ, [partly on account of this pl.,<br>\

(ISh, O, K:) or one should say مَعَانِقُ الرَّمْلِ.<br>\
(ISh, O.) ―<br>\
