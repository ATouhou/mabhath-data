being a mistake for عَمَهًا,]) and عُمُوهٌ and عُمُوهَةٌ<br>\
and عَمَهَانٌ, (K, TA,) [the first of the former verb,<br>\

right, or true: (TA:) or العَمَهُ is the looking<br>\
repeatedly, not knowing whither to go: (Lh, TA:)<br>\
or it is in the mental perception; and العَمَى is in<br>\
the sight, or is common to both of these. (TA.)<br>\
[Accord. to the Msb, عَمِهَ is from عَمْهَآء as an<br>\
epithet applied to land, expl. below: but this<br>\
requires consideration, as appears from what here<br>\
follows.] ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, عَمِهَتِ الأَرْضُ (tropical:)  The<br>\
land was destitute of signs of the way: (K, TA:)<br>\
a tropical phrase. (TA.)<br>\

unable to see his right course; and going repeatedly<br>\
to and fro: (S:) or going repeatedly to and fro,<br>\

in error, and confusion, or perplexity, (K,) unable<br>\

-b2-  [Its fem.] عَمْهَآءُ, applied to<br>\
a land (أَرْضٌ), signifies Having in it no signs of<br>\
the way (S, Msb, K) to guide to safety. (Msb.)<br>\
[Hence, accord. to the Msb, the verb عَمِهَ expl.<br>\
above: but some hold it to be tropical: see 1,<br>\
last sentence.]<br>\
