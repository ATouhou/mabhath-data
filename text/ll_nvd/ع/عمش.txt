عَمَشَ, (TA,) inf. n. عَمَشٌ,<br>\
(S, A, O, K,) He (a man, S, TA) was weak in<br>\
sight, (S, A, O, K,) and generally, or at most<br>\
times, shedding tears. (S, O, K.) And عَمِشَتِ<br>\
العَيْنُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, The eye was<br>\
generally, or at most times, shedding tears, and<br>\
weak in sight. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (A,) عَمِشَ فِيهِ,<br>\
said of speech, (assumed tropical:)  It produced a good effect upon<br>\
him. (A, O, K.) And فُلَانٌ لَا تَعْمَشُ فِيهِ المَوْعِظَةُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Such a one, exhortation produces no good effect<br>\
upon him. (A, O.) Both of these are chaste<br>\
phrases; for when exhortation produces an effect<br>\
upon a man, it becomes as though it were weaksighted, seeing nothing to amend in him. (A.)<br>\

sight termed] عَمَش [inf. n. of عَمِشَ, q. v.]. (O, K.)<br>\
