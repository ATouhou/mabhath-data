(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also [Ivory;] elephant&#39;s bone; (S, O,<br>\
K;) or [rather] only elephant&#39;s tusk; (Lth, Msb,<br>\
TA;) thus say ISd and Kz: (TA:) n. un. with<br>\
ة [signifying a piece of ivory]: (S, O:) of its<br>\

day two drachms with water and honey, if compressed after seven days, conceives. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
Tortoise-shell; syn. ذَبْلٌ [q. v.]; (O, K;) i. e. (O)<br>\

elephants&#39; tusks, for their tusks are مَيْتَة, [i. e.<br>\
they are taken from an animal of which the flesh<br>\
is unlawful food,] but ذبل: (O, * L, Msb: *) the<br>\
عاج of the elephant is impure accord. to EshSháfi&#39;ee, but pure accord. to Aboo-Haneefeh.<br>\

she-camel, one says عَاجِ, without tenween; and<br>\
if he please, عَاجْ, with jezm, as though a pause<br>\
were imagined to be made after it: or, accord. to<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd, one says to her عَاجٍ, and جَاهٍ, with<br>\
tenween: [but see art. جوه:] accord. to AHeyth,<br>\
a word of this kind is originally mejzoom; but in<br>\
the case of a rhyme, [and in any case of poetical<br>\
necessity,] it may be makhfood. (TA.) [See also<br>\
art. عج.]<br>\

latter is a simple subst.; and both, used as simple<br>\
substs.,] signify Crookedness, curvity, a bending, a<br>\
winding, wryness, contortion, distortion, or unevenness: (L:) or the former is peculiar to objects of<br>\
the sight, as bodies; and the latter, to what are not<br>\
seen, as opinion, and a saying, and religion: or,<br>\
as some say, the latter is used in both of these<br>\
cases; but the distinction is more common:<br>\
(IAth, TA:) AZ makes the same distinction;<br>\
but adds that some of the Arabs used the latter<br>\
word in relation to a road: (Msb:) accord. to<br>\
ISk, (S, O,) the former is in anything erect, (S,<br>\
O, K,) or in anything that was erect and has<br>\
inclined, (TA,) as a wall, (S, O, K, TA,) and a<br>\
stick, (S, O, Msb,) or a staff, (K, TA,) and a<br>\
spear; (TA;) and the latter, in land, or ground,<br>\
and in religion, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) and in<br>\
means of subsistence: (S, O:) in land, or ground,<br>\
the latter means unevenness; thus in the Kur xx.<br>\
106: in a road, deflection; as also عَوَجٌ: in religion, and in natural disposition, corruptness, or<br>\
deviation from rectitude: (TA:) and عَوَجٌ, (S,<br>\
O, TA, [thus accord. to both of my copies of the<br>\
S,]) or عِوَجٌ, (accord. to a copy of the A, [which<br>\
I incline to regard as the right, in consideration<br>\
of its consistency with explanations here preceding, notwithstanding the apparent preponderance<br>\
of authority in favour of عَوَجٌ,]) in a man, signifies evilness of natural disposition: (S, A, O: [and<br>\
so, app., هَوَجٌ:]) or عَوَجٌ, with fet-h to the ع, as<br>\
an inf. n., signifies the being evil in natural disposition. (KL.)<br>\

species of ذُرَة [or millet]. (TA.)<br>\

tortoise-shell also]; (S, O, K;) accord. to Sb:<br>\
(S, O:) and (O, K) accord. to another or others<br>\
(O) a seller thereof. (O, K.)<br>\
عَائِجٌ: for its fem. (with ة) as an epithet applied<br>\
to a she-camel, see عَاجٌ, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also أَعْوَجُ, near the end. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Stopping, or<br>\
pausing. (S, O.)<br>\
أَعْوَجُ Crooked, curved, bent, or bending, winding, wry, contorted, distorted, or uneven: (S, * O, *<br>\
L, Msb:) and ↓ مُعْوَجٌّ, [or this and the former<br>\
also,] crooked, curved, &amp;c., of itself: fem. of the<br>\
former عَوْجَآءُ: (L, Msb:) and pl. عُوجٌ. (L.)<br>\
One says ↓ عَصًا مُعْوَجَّةٌ [A crooked, or crooking,<br>\
staff or stick]; but not مِعْوَجَّةٌ, with kesr to the<br>\
م: (S, O:) or, accord. to ISk, one says the former; but not ↓ مُعَوَّجَةٌ, with fet-h to the ع and<br>\
teshdeed to the و; though analogy does not forbid<br>\
this, as it is allowable to say عَوَّجَهَا: accord. to As,<br>\
one should not say ↓ مُعَوَّجٌ, with teshdeed to the<br>\
و, except in applying it to a stick, or in another<br>\
sense expl. below: Az says that this word is<br>\
allowable as signifying rendered crooked or curved<br>\
&amp;c. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] العَوْجَآءُ signifies The<br>\
bow. (S, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَوْجَآءُ applied to a<br>\
woman, Inclining, or bending, towards her child,<br>\
to suckle it. (TA.) And, so applied, That has<br>\
become crooked by reason of leanness and hunger.<br>\
(Ham p. 744.) And, applied to a she-camel,<br>\
Lean, lank, light of flesh, slender, or lank in the<br>\
belly: (S, A, K:) or emaciated so that her back<br>\
has become crooked, or curved. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And<br>\
أَعْوَجُ applied to a هِلَال (or new moon), Oblique:<br>\
see أَدْفَقُ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  نَخِيلٌ عُوجٌ signifies Palm-trees<br>\
inclining, or leaning, and therefore crooked, or<br>\
curved: and accord. to some, the saying of<br>\
Lebeed, describing a [wild] he-ass and his she-asses,<br>\
وَأَوْرَدَهَا عَلَى عُوجٍ طِوَالِ<br>\
[the latter hemistich of a verse cited in the first<br>\
paragraph of art. حوذ] means, And he brought<br>\
them to the watering-place at [tall] palm-trees<br>\
growing over the water, inclining and curving by<br>\
reason of the abundance of their fruit: but others<br>\
say that the meaning of على عوج is, upon their<br>\
crooked legs. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Hence, عُوجٌ signifies The<br>\
legs of a horse or similar beast; (O, TA;) as ISd<br>\
says, thus used as an epithet in which the quality<br>\
of a subst. predominates [app. implying their<br>\
having that bending, or curving, and tension of<br>\
the sinews, termed تَجْنِيب, agreeably with what<br>\
here follows]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And hence also, (TA,)<br>\
خَيْلٌ عُوجٌ meaning Horses that have, in their hind<br>\
legs, the quality termed تَجْنِيب. (A, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
أَعْوَجُ applied to a man means [Crooked in temper,<br>\
or] evil in natural disposition. (S, A, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
المِلَّةُ العَوْجَآءُ [The crooked, or perverted, or corrupted, religion] is a phrase occurring in a trad.,<br>\
applied to the religion of Abraham as changed by<br>\
the Arabs from its state of rectitude. (TA.)<br>\
And one says خُطَّةٌ عَوْجَآءُ, and رَأْىٌ أَعْوَجُ, meaning [An affair, and an opinion,] not of a right<br>\
kind. (A.) ―<br>\
-b10-  الأَيَّامُ عُوجٌ رَوَاجِعُ [The days are<br>\
apt to decline from the right course, apt to return,]<br>\
is a prov., (Meyd, O, TA,) meaning fortune at<br>\
one time declines from thee, and at another time<br>\
returns to thee; (Meyd;) said by him at whose<br>\
affliction one rejoices, or said on his part, and<br>\
sometimes on an occasion of threatening: Az<br>\
says that عُوجٌ, here, may be pl. of أَعْوَجُ, or of<br>\
عَوْجَآءُ; or it may be pl. of ↓ عَائِجٌ, and originally<br>\
عُوُجٌ. (O, TA.) [Hence,] العُوجُ is used as signifying The days [in allusion to their variableness<br>\
with respect to good and evil]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  And<br>\
أَعْوَجُ is a [proper] name of A watering-trough.<br>\
(Th, TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-  See also the next paragraph, in<br>\
four places.<br>\

to the Benoo-Hilál, (S, O, K,) a stallion than<br>\
which there was none more celebrated among the<br>\
Arabs, nor any that had a more numerous progeny: (S, O:) they were also called الخَيْلُ<br>\
الأَعْوَجِيَّةُ, (L,) and ↓ بَنَاتُ أَعْوَجَ, (S, O,) and بَنَاتُ<br>\
↓ عُوجٍ; and a poet says,<br>\
وَقَاحُ الحَافِرِ ↓ أَحْوَى مِنَ العُوجِ<br>\
[Brown, or a blackish bay, of the progeny of<br>\
Aawaj, hard in the hoof]; meaning مِنْ وَلَدِ<br>\
↓ أَعْوَجَ; using that form of pl. because أَعْوَجُ is<br>\
originally an epithet. (TA.)<br>\
مَعَاجٌ A place to which one turns; or in which<br>\
one remains, stays, dwells, or abides. (Har p. 325.)<br>\
