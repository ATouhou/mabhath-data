عَمَرَ; (S, O, Msb, K;) and عَمَرَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَمُرَ (K) and<br>\
عَمِرَ; (Sb, K;) inf. n. عَمْرٌ (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K) and عُمْرٌ, (S, O, Msb,) both anomalous,<br>\
as inf. ns. of عَمِرَ, for by rule the inf. n. should be<br>\
عَمَرٌ, (S,) but عَمَرٌ is also an inf. n., (TA,) and<br>\
عُمُرٌ, which is the most chaste, (O,) and عَمَارَةٌ;<br>\
(K;) He lived, (S, O,) or continued in life (بَقِىَ),<br>\
(K,) long, or a long time; (S, O, K; *) his life<br>\
was, or became, long: (Msb:) and عَمِرَ he grew<br>\
old. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَمَرَ بِمَكَانٍ He remained, continued, stayed, resided, dwelt, or abode, in a place.<br>\
(B, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَمَرَ, aor.<br>\
عَمُرَ, inf. n. عَمْرٌ, (Msb,) or<br>\
عِمَارَةٌ and عُمْرَانٌ, (MA,) It (a place of abode)<br>\
became inhabited; (MA, Msb;) بِأَهْلهِ [by its<br>\
people]: (Msb:) [it became peopled, well peopled,<br>\
well stocked with people and the like, in a flourishing state, in a state the contrary of desolate or<br>\
waste or ruined, or in a state of good repair:]<br>\
and in like manner you say, عَمِرَتِ الدَّارُ, aor.<br>\
عَمَرَ,<br>\
inf. n. عَمْرٌ, the house became inhabited [&amp;c.].<br>\
(MA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [You say also, عَمَرَتِ الأَرْضُ The land<br>\
became inhabited, peopled, well stocked with people<br>\
and camels and the like, colonized, cultivated,<br>\
well cultivated, in a flourishing state, or in a<br>\
state the contrary of waste: see its act. part. n.,<br>\
عَامِرٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَمَرَ المَالُ, aor.<br>\
عَمُرَ; and عَمِرَ, aor.<br>\
عَمَرَ;<br>\
(K;) and عَمُرَ, aor.<br>\
عَمُرَ; (Sb, K;) inf. n. عِمَارَةٌ;<br>\
(K; [so in most copies; in the TA, عَمَارَةٌ, and<br>\
there said to be inf. n. of عَمُرَ; but, I think,<br>\
erroneously;]) i. q. صَارَ عَامِرًا [The property, consisting of camels or the like, became in a flourishing state]; (K;) the property became much; the<br>\
camels, or the like, became many, or numerous.<br>\
(Sgh.)<br>\
-A3-  عَمَرَهُ, (Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
عَمُرَ, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
عِمَارَةٌ (K [so in most copies, but in the TA, عَمَارَةٌ,<br>\
with fet-h, which I think erroneous;]) and عُمُورٌ<br>\
(K) and عُمْرَانٌ, (TA,) He inhabited it; remained, continued, stayed, resided, dwelt, or<br>\
abode, in it; namely, a place of abode: (Msb:)<br>\
he kept to it; namely, his property, or his camels<br>\
or the like, and his house, or tent: (K:) one<br>\
should not say, of a man, مَنْزِلِهُ ↓ أَعْمَرَ, with ا.<br>\
(Az, TA.) إِنَّمَا يَعْمُرُ مَسَاجِدَ اللّٰهِ, in the Kur<br>\
[ix. 18], signifies Only he shall abide in the<br>\
mosques, or places of worship, of God: or shall<br>\
visit them: (TA:) see 8: but Z says, I know<br>\
not عَمَرَ as occurring in the sense of اعتمر [he<br>\
visited]: (TA:) or shall enter them and sit in<br>\
them: (Jel:) or the verb in the above-cited<br>\
phrase of the Kur has another signification,<br>\
which see below. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  عَمَرَهُ is also syn.<br>\
with عَمَّرَهُ, in the first of the senses expl. below:<br>\
see 2.<br>\
-A5-  عَمَرَ اللّٰهُ بِكَ مَنْزِلَكَ, (AZ, S, O, K, *)<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَمُرَ, (TA,) inf. n. عِمَارَةٌ; (K;) and ↓ أَعْمَرَهُ;<br>\
(AZ, S, O, K;) May God make thy place of<br>\
abode to become peopled, [or well peopled, well<br>\
stocked with people and the like, in a flourishing<br>\
state, in a state the contrary of ruined or waste<br>\
or desolate, or in a state of good repair,] by thee<br>\
[or by thy means]: (K, * TA:) but AZ says that<br>\
one should not say, of a man, مَنْزِلَهُ ↓ أَعْمَرَ, with ا.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَمَرَ الخَرَابَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, [He<br>\
made the ruin, or waste, or the like, to become in<br>\
a state of good repair, in a state the contrary of<br>\
ruined or waste or desolate.] (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [عَمَرَ<br>\
الأَرْضَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, He peopled the<br>\
land; stocked it well with people and camels and<br>\
the like; colonized it; cultivated it, or cultivated<br>\
it well; rendered it in a flourishing state, or in a<br>\
state the contrary of waste.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَمَرَ البِنَآءَ,<br>\
aor. and inf. n. as above, He kept the building in<br>\
a good state; syn. حَفِظَهُ. (TA.) So accord. to<br>\
some, in the Kur, إِنَّمَا يَعْمُرُ مَسَاجِدَ اللّٰهِ, [quoted<br>\
above,] Only he shall keep in a good state [or in<br>\
repair] the mosques, or places of worship, of God:<br>\
(TA:) among the significations of the verb as<br>\
here used, are these; he shall adorn them with<br>\
carpets or the like, and light them with lamps,<br>\
and continue the performance of religious worship<br>\
and praise and the study of science in them, and<br>\
guard them from [desecration by] that for which<br>\
they are not built, such as worldly discourse. (Bd.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  عَمَرَ الدَّارَ, aor.<br>\
عَمُرَ, inf. n. عَمْرٌ [and عِمَارَةٌ,<br>\
(MA,) or this, accord. to the Msb, is a simple<br>\
subst.], He built the house. (Msb.) [And] He<br>\
made the house to be inhabited; he peopled it;<br>\
(MA;) [or made it to be well stocked with people<br>\
and the like, or in a flourishing state, or in a state<br>\
of good repair.] ―<br>\
-b6-  عَمَرَ الخَيْرَ, aor.<br>\
عَمُرَ, inf. n. عَمْرٌ<br>\
and عِمَارَةٌ, [app., He instituted what was good:<br>\
or perhaps, he cultivated, or promoted, it: or he<br>\
kept to it; or observed it; or regarded it.] (Az,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A6-  عَمَرَ رَبَّهُ, (IAar, K,) aor.<br>\
عَمُرَ, (IAar, O,)<br>\
[inf. n. عِمَارَةٌ,] He served, or worshipped, his<br>\
Lord; (IAar, K;) he prayed and fasted. (Ks,<br>\
Lh, O, K.) You say تَرَكْتُ فُلَانًا يَعْمُرُ رَبَّهُ I left<br>\
such a one worshipping his Lord, praying and<br>\
fasting. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
عَمَّرَهُ اللّٰهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَعْمِيرٌ; (S,<br>\
Msb;) and ↓ عَمَرَهُ, (Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
عَمُرَ, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. عَمْرٌ; (TA;) God lengthened, or prolonged,<br>\
his life; (S, O, Msb, TA;) made him to continue<br>\
in life; preserved him alive; (K, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ استعمرهُ. (O and Bd in xi. 64.) It is said in<br>\
the Kur [xxxv. 12], وَمَا يُعَمَّرُ مِنْ مُعَمَّرٍ وَلَا يُنْقَصُ<br>\
إِلَّا فِى كِتَابٍ, i. e., No one whose life is prolonged<br>\
has life prolonged, nor is aught diminished of his,<br>\
meaning another&#39;s, life, but it is recorded in a<br>\
writing: (I&#39;Ab, Fr, * O: *) or the meaning is, nor<br>\
does aught pass of his, i. e. the same person&#39;s,<br>\
life: (Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Jubeyr:) both these explanations are good; but the former seems more probably correct. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عمّر نَفْسَهُ He determined for himself, or assigned to himself, a limited<br>\
life. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عمّر اللّٰهَ, inf. n. تَعْمِيرٌ, He acknowledged the everlasting existence of God. (S, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  عَمَّرْتُكَ اللّٰهَ I ask, or beg, God to prolong thy<br>\
life: (Ks, O, TA:) or I remind thee of God.<br>\
(TA, app. on the authority of Mbr.) [It also<br>\
seems to signify I swear to thee by the everlasting<br>\
existence of God. See عَمْرَ اللّٰهِ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  أُعَمِّرُكَ اللّٰهَُ أَنْ<br>\
تَفْعَلَ كَذَا I adjure thee by God, and beg thee by<br>\
the length of thy life, that thou do such a thing.<br>\
(K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See also 4.<br>\
-A2-  عَمَّرَ خِبَآءً بِمَا احْتَاجَ إِلَيْهِ<br>\
[He furnished a tent with what he required].<br>\
(Msb in art. بنى.)<br>\
3<br>\
عَامَرْتُهُ طُولَ حَيَاتِهِ [I lived with him for the<br>\
length of his life]. (M in art. بلو.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَعْمَرَ see 1, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  اعمرهُ المَكَانَ, (K,)<br>\
and فِيهِ ↓ استعمرهُ, (S, K,) i. q. جَعَلَهُ يَعْمُرُهُ (K)<br>\
or جعله عَامِرَهُ (S) [He made him to inhabit the<br>\
place, or to people, or colonize, or cultivate, it].<br>\
So the latter signifies in the Kur [xi. 64],<br>\
فِيهَا ↓ وَاسْتَعْمَرَكُمْ (S) And He hath made you to<br>\
dwell therein: (O, Jel:) or hath required of you<br>\
to inhabit it, or to people it, &amp;c.: (Z:) or hath<br>\
enabled and commanded you to do so: (Bd:)<br>\
or hath permitted you to do so, and to fetch<br>\
out by labour, or art, your food [for قومكم in the<br>\
L and TA, I read قُوتكم, and this is evidently the<br>\
right,] from it: (TA:) or hath given you your<br>\
houses therein for your lives; or made you to<br>\
dwell in them during your lives, and then to leave<br>\
them to others: (Bd:) or hath prolonged your<br>\
lives therein. (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَعْمَرْتُهُ دَارًا,<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, *) or أَرْضًا, or إِبِلًا, (S, O,)<br>\
and إِيَّاهَا ↓ عَمَّرْتُهُ, (K, *) I assigned to him the house<br>\
for his life, (Msb, K,) or for my life, (K,) to inhabit it for that period; (Msb, TA;) I said to<br>\
him, of a house, (S, Mgh, O,) or of land, or of<br>\
camels, (S, O,) It is thine, (S, Mgh, O,) or they<br>\
are thine, (S, O,) for my life, (S, Mgh, O,) or<br>\
for thy life, and when thou diest it returns, or<br>\
they return, to me. (S, O.) The doing so is forbidden. (Mgh, TA.) [See also عُمْرَى: and see<br>\
أَرْقَبَ, and رُقْبَى.] ―<br>\
-b4-  اعمر الأَرْضَ He found the<br>\
land to be عَامِرَة, (S, O, K,) i. e., peopled [and<br>\
cultivated, or in a flourishing state]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
اعمر عَلَيْهِ He rendered him rich; made him to be<br>\
possessed of competence or sufficiency, to be without<br>\
wants, or to have few wants. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  اعمرهُ He<br>\
aided him to perform the visit called عُمْرَة;<br>\
(Mgh, O, K;) [said to be] on the authority of<br>\
analogy; not on that of hearsay; (Mgh;) but<br>\
occurring in a trad.: (Mgh, TA:) or he made<br>\
him to perform that visit. (IKtt, Msb.)<br>\
-A3-  See<br>\
also 8.<br>\
8<br>\
اعتمر He visited. (Msb, K: in some copies<br>\
of the K اعتمرهُ.) You say, اعتمرهُ, (S, O,) and<br>\
↓ اعمرهُ, (ISk, Msb,) He visited him, or it; (S,<br>\
O;) he repaired, or betook himself, to him, or it;<br>\
(ISk, S, O, Msb;) as also ↓ عَمَرَهُ, accord. to one<br>\
explanation of a passage in the Kur ix. 18,<br>\
quoted above: [see 1:] but Z says, I know not<br>\
عَمَرَ as occurring in the sense of اعتمر. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
He performed the religious visit called عُمْرَة. (O,<br>\
TA.) You say اعتمر فِى الحَجِّ [He performed<br>\
the visit so called in the pilgrimage]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
اعتمر أَمْرًا He betook himself to a thing, or an<br>\
affair; as, for instance, a warring and plundering expedition; aimed at it; purposed it. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also He attired his head (i. e. his own head)<br>\
with an عَمَارَة, i. e., a turban, &amp;c. (S, K.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَعْمَرَ see 2: ―<br>\
-b2-  and also 4, in two places.<br>\
عَمْرٌ and ↓ عُمْرٌ are both inf. ns., signifying the<br>\
same. (S, O.) [See 1. As such, the former is<br>\
the more common.] And both of these words,<br>\
(Mgh, K, &amp;c.,) and ↓ عُمُرٌ, (K, &amp;c.,) [used as<br>\
simple substs., or abstract ns., in which case the<br>\
second is more common than the first, except in<br>\
forms of swearing, in which the former is used,<br>\
and the third is more chaste than the second,]<br>\
signify Life; (Msb, K;) [the age to which the<br>\
life extends;] the period during which the body is<br>\
inhabited by life: so that it denotes less than<br>\
بَقَآءٌ: wherefore the latter is [frequently] used as<br>\
an attribute of God; but عمر is seldom used as<br>\
such: (Er-Rághib, B:) pl. أَعْمَارٌ. (K.) You<br>\
say ↓ أَطَالَ اللّٰهُ عُمُرَكَ and عَمْرَكَ [May God prolong thy life]. (S, O.) In a form of swearing,<br>\
عَمْر only is used. (S.) [In a case of this kind,<br>\
when ل is not prefixed to it, it is in the accus.<br>\
case, as will be shown and expl. below: but when<br>\
ل is prefixed to it, it is in the nom.] You say<br>\
لَعَمْرُكَ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ, meaning By thy life, I will assuredly do [such a thing]. (Msb.) لَعَمْرُكَ occurs<br>\
in the Kur xv. 72, and means By thy life: (I&#39;Ab,<br>\
Akh, Bd, Jel:) and ↓ لَعَمَرُكَ is a dial. var., mentioned by Yoo: (O:) or the former, accord. to<br>\
the grammarians, means by thy religion: (AHeyth,<br>\
O:) and [in like manner] لَعَمْرِى, and ↓ لَعَمَرِى,<br>\
[by my life, or] by my religion. (K.) لَعَمْرُكَ is<br>\
an inchoative, of which the enunciative, مَا أُقْسِمُ<br>\
بِهِ, [that by which I swear, so that the entire<br>\
phrase means thy life is that by which I swear,]<br>\
is understood; therefore it is in the nom. case:<br>\
(IJ, TA:) or the complete phrase is وَعَمْرِكَ<br>\
فَلَعَمْرُكَ عَظِيمٌ [by thy life, &amp;c.: and thy life is of<br>\
great account]. (Fr, as related by A&#39;Obeyd.)<br>\
You say also لَعَمْرُ أَبِيكَ الخَيْرَ, and الخَيْرِ; the<br>\
former meaning By thy father&#39;s instituting, or<br>\
promoting, or keeping to, or observing, or regarding, what is good; الخير being the objective complement of عمر, from عَمَرَ الخَيْرَ, aor.<br>\
عَمُرَ, inf. n.<br>\
عَمْرٌ and عِمَارَةٌ; [see 1;] but in the latter case,<br>\
الخَيْرِ is an epithet added to أَبِيكَ [so that the<br>\
meaning is by the life of thy good father].<br>\
(AHeyth, Az, O, TA.) [See also art. خير.]<br>\
You also say لَعَمْرُ اللّٰهِ, meaning By the everlasting existence of God; (S, O, K;) عمر being here<br>\
in the nom. case as an inchoative, with ل prefixed<br>\
to it as a corroborative of the inchoative state:<br>\
the enunciative is understood; the complete<br>\
phrase being لَعَمْرُ اللّٰهِ قَسَمِى or مَا أُقْسِمُ بِهِ [the<br>\
everlasting existence of God is my oath, or that by<br>\
which I swear]. (S, O.) This expression is forbidden in a trad., (K,) because عَمْرٌ [properly]<br>\
means the life of the body: (TA:) [but] لَعَمْرُ<br>\
إِلٰهِكَ, meaning By the everlasting existence of thy<br>\
God, occurs in a trad. (TA.) When you do<br>\
not prefix ل, you make it to be in the accus. case,<br>\
as an inf. n.: thus you say, عمْرَ اللّٰهِ مَا فَعَلْتُ كَذَا<br>\
(S, O, K) I swear by the everlasting existence of<br>\
God, I did not so: (S, O:) and عَمْرَكَ اللّٰهَ مَا<br>\
فَعَلْتُ كَذَا (S, O, K, [in the CK اللّٰهُ, but this is<br>\
a mistake,]) By thine acknowledgment of the<br>\
everlasting existence of God, I did not so: (S,<br>\
O:) or the original thereof is عَمَّرْتُكَ اللّٰهَ تَعْمِيرًا,<br>\
(O, K,) i. e., I ask, or beg, God to prolong thy<br>\
life: (Ks, O:) [and it is said in the S that عَمْرَكَ<br>\
اللّٰهَ sometimes has this signification:] and in like<br>\
manner عَمْرَكَ اللّٰهَ لَا أَفْعَلُ ذَاكَ means I beg God<br>\
to prolong thy life: I will not do that: or it may<br>\
be a form of oath without و [for وَعَمْرِكَ]: (Ks:)<br>\
and you say عَمْرَكَ اللّٰهَ اِفْعَلْ كَذَا and إِلَّا فَعَلْتَ<br>\
كَذَا [and إِلَّا مَا فَعَلْتَ كَذَا By thine acknowledgment of the everlasting existence of God, &amp;c.,<br>\
do thou so]: (TA:) or عَمْرَكَ اللّٰهَ signifies by thy<br>\
worship of God: (AHeyth:) or I remind thee,<br>\
reminding thee, of God. (K.) Mbr says of this<br>\
phrase, عمرك اللّٰه, that عمر may be in the accus.<br>\
case on account of a verb understood; [such, for<br>\
instance, as أُذَكِّرُكَ;] or by reason of و suppressed, the complete phrase being وَعَمْرِكَ اللّٰهَ; or<br>\
as being for [the inf. n.] تَعْمِير. (TA.) It may<br>\
also be [found written] عَمْرَ اللّٰهَ; but this is bad.<br>\
(Ks.) Some of the Arabs, for لَعَمْرُكَ, said<br>\
رَعَمْلُكَ. (Az.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَمْرًا وَشَبَابًا: see قُحَابٌ.<br>\
-A2-  عَمْرٌ<br>\
(AHeyth, K) and ↓ عَمَرٌ (K) signify Religion;<br>\
(AHeyth, K;) as in the phrases لَعَمْرِى and<br>\
↓ لَعَمَرِى (K) and لَعَمْرُكَ (AHeyth) [mentioned above].<br>\
-A3-  Also عَمْرٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
↓ عُمْرٌ (IAth, O, K) The flesh that is between the<br>\
teeth: (S, O, Msb, K:) or the pendent piece of<br>\
flesh between the teeth: (Az, Msb:) or the flesh<br>\
that is between the places in which the teeth are<br>\
set: (TA:) or the flesh of the gum: (K:) or the<br>\
flesh of the gum that runs between any two teeth:<br>\
(TA:) or what appears of the gum: (Kh, Msb:)<br>\
or (so accord. to the TA, but in the K “ and ”)<br>\
anything of an oblong shape between two teeth:<br>\
(K:) pl. عُمُورٌ: (S, O, Msb, K:) which some explain as signifying the places whence the teeth<br>\
grow. (TA.) It is said in a trad., أَوْصَانِى جِبْرِيلُ<br>\
بِالسِّوَاكِ حَتَّى خَشِيتُ عَلَى عُمُورِى [Gabriel enjoined me to make use of the tooth-stick so that I<br>\
feared for my عمور]. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  أُمُّ عَمْرٍو:<br>\
see عَامِرٌ.<br>\
عُمْرٌ: see عَمْرٌ, in two places.<br>\
عَمَرٌ: see عَمْرٌ, in four places.<br>\
عُمُرٌ: see عَمْرٌ, in two places.<br>\
عَمْرَةٌ: see عَمَارَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  أَبُو عَمْرَةَ means Bankruptcy,<br>\
insolvency, or the state of having no property remaining; (Lth, O, K;) which is said to be thus<br>\
called because it was the name of an envoy of<br>\
El-Mukhtár the son of Aboo-&#39;Obeyd, on the<br>\
occasion of whose alighting at the abode of a<br>\
people, slaughter and war used to befall them:<br>\
(Lth, O, K: *) ―<br>\
-b2-  and (K) hunger. (IAar, K.)<br>\
عُمْرَةٌ A visit, or a visiting: (S, Msb, K:) or<br>\
a visit in which is the cultivation (عِمَارَة) of love<br>\
or affection: (TA:) or a repairing to an inhabited, or a peopled, place: this is the primary<br>\
signification. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the عُمْرَة in pilgrimage [and at any time]; (S, O; *) i. e. [A<br>\
religious visit to the sacred places at Mekkeh,<br>\
with the performance of the ceremony of الإِحْرَام,]<br>\
the circuiting round the Kaabeh, and the going<br>\
to and fro between Es-Safà and El-Marweh:<br>\
الحَجُّ [differs from it inasmuch as it is at a particular time of the year and] is not complete without the halting at &#39;Arafát on the day of &#39;Arafeh:<br>\
(Zj, TA:) the عُمْرَة is the minor pilgrimage (الحَجُّ<br>\
الأَصْغَرُ); (Msb, and Kull p. 168;) what is commonly termed الحَجُّ being called sometimes the<br>\
greater pilgrimage (الحَجُّ الأَكْبَرُ): (Kull:) pl.<br>\
عُمَرٌ (S, O, Msb) and عُمَرَاتٌ or عُمُرَاتٌ or عُمْرَاتٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A man&#39;s going in to his [newlymarried] wife in the abode of her family: (IAar,<br>\
S, K:) if he removes her to his own family, the<br>\
act is termed عُرْسٌ. (IAar, S.)<br>\
عُمْرَى a subst., (إِسْمٌ [strangely read by Golius<br>\
أَسْمَرُ], S, O,) or an inf. n., (TA,) [or rather a quasiinf. n.,] from أَعْمَرَهُ دَارًا and the like; (S, O, TA;)<br>\
A man&#39;s assigning to another a house for the life<br>\
of the latter, or for the life of the former;<br>\
(accord. to the explanation of the verb in the<br>\
K;) a man&#39;s saying to another, of a house, or of<br>\
land, or of camels, It is thine, or they are thine,<br>\
for my life, or for thy life, and when thou diest<br>\
it returns, or they return, to me; (accord. to the<br>\
explanation of the verb in the S and Mgh and<br>\
O;) a man&#39;s giving to another a house, and saying to him, This is thine for thy life, or for my<br>\
life: (Th, in TA: [in which is added, “whichever of us dies,” ايّنا مات, but this I consider a<br>\
mistake for إِذَا مَاتَ, “when he dies,”) “ the<br>\
house is given to his family: ”]) so they used to<br>\
do in the Time of Ignorance: (TA:) but some<br>\
of the Muslim lawyers hold the gift to be absolute, and the condition to be null. (TA, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also [The property, or house, &amp;c., so given;] what<br>\
is assigned, or given, to another for the period of<br>\
his life, or for that of the life of the giver. (K.)<br>\

q. v.] ―<br>\

(S, O,) or which a chief puts, (TA,) upon his<br>\
head, such as a turban, and a قَلَنْسُوَة, and a crown,<br>\
&amp;c., (AO, S, O, K,) as a sign of headship, and<br>\
for keeping it in mind; (TA;) as also ↓ عَمْرَةٌ<br>\

a coll. gen. n., of which عَمَارَةٌ is the n. un., and]<br>\
also signifies any sweet-smelling plant (رَيْحَان)<br>\
which a chief puts upon his head for the same<br>\
purpose: and hence, (tropical:)  any such plant, absolutely:<br>\
(B:) or any such plant with which a drinkingchamber is adorned, (S, K,) called by the Persians<br>\
مَيْوَرَانْ; when any one comes in to the people there<br>\
assembled, they raise somewhat thereof with their<br>\
hands, and salute him with it, wishing him a long<br>\
life: so, accord. to some, in a verse of El-Aashà,<br>\
which see below: (S:) or it there signifies crowns<br>\
of such plants, which they put upon their heads,<br>\
as the foreigners (العَجَم) do; but ISd says, “I<br>\
know not how this is: ” or the myrtle; syn. آس:<br>\
(TA:) and عَمَارةٌ signifies a plant of that kind,<br>\
with which one used to salute a king, saying, May<br>\
God prolong thy life: or, as some say, a raising<br>\
of the voice, saying so: (Az, TA:) a salutation;<br>\
(K;) said to mean, may God prolong thy life;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ عَمَارٌ (S, K) and ↓ عِمَارَةٌ; (L;)<br>\

↓ سَجَدْنَا لَهُ وَرَفَعْنَا العَمَارَا<br>\
[And when he came to us, a little after slumber,<br>\
we prostrated ourselves to him, and] we put the<br>\
turbans from our heads, in honour of him: (S:)<br>\
but IB says that, accord. to this explanation, the<br>\
correct reading is وَضَعْنَا العَمَارَا: (TA:) or the<br>\
former reading means, we raised our voices with<br>\
prayer for him, and said, May God prolong thy<br>\
life: or we raised the sweet-smelling plants: &amp;c.:<br>\
see above. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also عَمَارَةٌ, (K,) or<br>\
↓ عِمَارَةٌ, (O,) An ornamented piece of cloth which<br>\

and the like, colonized, cultivated, well cultivated,<br>\
in a flourishing state, or in a state the contrary of<br>\
desolate or waste or ruined; app. meaning, work,<br>\
or labour, by which a place is rendered so; as it<br>\
is immediately added in the K that عُمَارَةٌ signifies<br>\
hire, pay, or wages, of it, or for it; and the explanation which I have here given is agreeable<br>\
with ancient and modern usage; to which it<br>\
may be further added, that the measure (فِعَالَةٌ)<br>\
is common to words signifying arts, occupations,<br>\
or employments, as زِرَاعَةٌ and فِلَاحَةٌ &amp;c.]. (K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also a subst. from عَمَرَ الدَّارَ. (Msb.)<br>\

that subsists by itself, migrating by itself, and<br>\
abiding by itself, and seeking pasturage by itself:<br>\
(O, TA:) or it is called by the former name because it peoples a land; and by the latter, because<br>\
complex like a turban; (TA;) and ↓ عَمِيرَةٌ signifies the same; or, as some say, all signify a بَطْن:<br>\
(Ham p. 682:) or i. q. قَبِيلَةٌ and عَشِيرَةٌ: (S, O:)<br>\
