and broad, portions,] upon which no leaves have<br>\
grown; that [or those parts] upon which leaves<br>\
have grown being termed سَعَفٌ: (S, O:) pl. [of<br>\

وَالقُضُمِ وَالكَرَانِيفِ [He was taken, i. e. he died,<br>\

&#39;Alee, When such and such things shall happen<br>\
(mentioning factions, or seditions), ضَرَبَ يَعْسُوبُ<br>\
الدِّينِ بِذَنَبِهِ; (A, O, TA;) in which, accord. to<br>\
As, يعسوب الدين means the chief of men in<br>\
respect of religion at that time; (TA;) or it<br>\
means the leader of the religion: (T and TA in<br>\
art. ضرب:) and it is said that ضرب بذنبه here<br>\
means shall quit the faction, or sedition, and its<br>\
party, with his partisans in religion; by ذنبه<br>\
being meant his followers; and by ضرب, shall go<br>\
away through the land, journeying, or warring in<br>\
the cause of the religion: or , as Z says, ضرب<br>\
بذنبه means (tropical:)  shall remain, and be firm, together<br>\
with his religious followers; and accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, the same is said of the locust, when it<br>\
lays its eggs, thrusting its tail into the ground;<br>\
and the meaning here is, (assumed tropical:)  shall remain firm until<br>\
the people shall return to him, and the religion<br>\
become manifest, and spread abroad. (TA. [See<br>\
also ضَرَبَ and ذَنَبٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  Gold; so called<br>\
because it is that by means of which an affair is<br>\
managed, or ordered: and [in a larger sense]<br>\
a thing to which one has recourse for protection<br>\
or the like; as in a saying of &#39;Alee, in which<br>\
wealth is termed the يعسوب of the unbelievers<br>\
or of the hypocrites. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A certain<br>\
flying thing, smaller than the locust; (As,<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd, K;) or larger; (K;) and having a<br>\
long tail: (TA:) or a certain flying thing, longer<br>\
than the locust, that does not contract its wings<br>\
when it alights; to which a horse is likened for<br>\
the slenderness of its body: (S, O:) or a kind of<br>\
moth, or the like, (فَرَاشَةٌ,) of a greenish colour,<br>\
that flies in the [season called] رَبِيع. (IAth, TA.)<br>\
[Golius explains it as “ Insectum oblongum,<br>\
quaternis pennis volucre, mordella Gazæ, seu orsodacna Aristot. ” ] ―<br>\
-b5-  And A species of حَجَل [or<br>\
partridge]. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And A blaze, or<br>\
white mark, on a horse&#39;s face, (K, TA,) of a long<br>\
shape, terminating before it extends as far as the<br>\
upper parts of the nostrils; or extending upwards<br>\
along the bone of the nose, wide and straight, until<br>\
it reaches the lower part of the even portion of the<br>\
forehead, whether it be little or much, if it do not<br>\
reach as far as the eyes: (TA:) or a white line,<br>\
or stripe, of the blaze, extending downwards until<br>\
it touches the fore part of the nose and mouth.<br>\
(En-Nadr, A&#39;Obeyd, Az, O.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And (accord.<br>\
to Lth, O) A دَائِرَة [or what we term a feather]<br>\
in the part of the flank of a horse where the rider<br>\
strikes it with his foot: (O, K, TA:) but Az<br>\
says that this is a mistake, and that the correct<br>\
meaning is that given above on the authority of<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  The ى in يَعْسُوبٌ is augmentative; because there is no Arabic word of<br>\
the measure فَعْلُولٌ except صَعْفُوقٌ. (S, O.)<br>\
