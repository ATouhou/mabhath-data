mimosa örfota; (see his Flora Ægypt. Arab.,<br>\
pp. cxxiii. and 177;)] a sort of trees of the<br>\
[description termed] عِضَاه, (S, O, K,) which exudes<br>\
[the gum called] مُغْفُور, and of which the fruit<br>\
(بَرَمَة) is white and round: (S:) it has a gum of<br>\
disagreeable odour ; and when bees eat it, somewhat of its odour is found in their honey: (TA:)<br>\
AHn says that, accord. to Aboo-Ziyád, it is of<br>\
the عضاه, and spreads upon the ground, not rising<br>\
towards the sky, and has a broad leaf, and a<br>\
sharp, curved thorn; it is of those trees of which<br>\
the bark is stripped off and made into well-ropes;<br>\
(O, TA;) and there comes forth from its fruit<br>\
(بَرَم) what is termed عُلَّفَةٌ, [i. e. a pod,] resembling a bean, (O, * TA,) which is eaten by the<br>\
camels and the sheep or goats: (O:) it is said by<br>\
another, or others, that its fruit (بَرَمَة) is called<br>\
فَتْلَة, and is white, as though fringed with cotton;<br>\
(O, TA;) like the button of the shirt, or somewhat<br>\
larger: (O:) Aboo-Ziyád [further] says, (TA,)<br>\
it is compact in its branches; has no wood that is<br>\
useful like other wood; and has abundance of<br>\
gum, which sometimes drops upon the ground until<br>\
there are, beneath the trees, what resemble great<br>\
mill-stones: Sh says that it is a short tree, the<br>\
branches of which are near together, having many<br>\
thorns; its height is like that of a camel lying<br>\
down; it has a small, diminutive leaf; grows<br>\
upon the mountains; and the camels eat it, particularly desiring the upper extremities of its<br>\
branches: (O, TA:) [the word is a coll. gen. n.:]<br>\
the n. un. is with إِبِلٌ عُرْفُطِيَّةٌ. (O, K.)<br>\
عُرْفُط Camels that eat the [kind of trees<br>\
called] عُرْفُط. (TA.)<br>\
