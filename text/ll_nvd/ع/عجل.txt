And عَجِلْتُ بِهِ [I was quick, or beforehand, with<br>\

2<br>\
عجّلهُ, inf. n. تَعْجِيلٌ: see 4, in two places.<br>\

It is said in the Kur [xxxviii. 15], رَبَّنَا عَجِّلْ لَنَا<br>\
قِطَّنَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ الحِسَابِ [O our Lord hasten to us<br>\
our portion before the day of reckoning]: (TA:)<br>\

accord. to Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Jubeyr, it means, of Paradise. (TA in art. قط.) And you say, عَجَّلْتُ إِلَيْهِ<br>\

[which, app., is properly rendered Would that<br>\
thou didst hasten, with thy husbandless woman,<br>\
the early portion of food called عَجُول, or the<br>\
right reading may be العِجَّوْلَ,] meaning عَجِّلْ بِهَا<br>\
الزَّوَاجَ [(assumed tropical:)  hasten thou, with her, i. e. with thy husbandless woman, marriage]. (TA.) One says<br>\
also عَجَّلْتُمْ like as one says لَهَّنْتُمْ [i. e. Ye supplied,<br>\

which is also called عَجُول, or عِجَّوْل, &amp;c.]. (S,<br>\

(M and K in art. بدر;) namely, a thing. (M<br>\
ibid.) And عاجل غَيْرَهُ إِلَيْهِ i. q. بَدَرَهُ اليه, (M and<br>\
K in art. بدر,) like بَادَرَهُ اليه [He hastened with<br>\
another, or vied or strove with him in hastening,<br>\

-b2-  [Also He dealt hastily with him.] And عاجلهُ<br>\
بِذَنْبِهِ He punished him for his sin, or crime, or<br>\
offence, (أَخَذَهُ بِهِ,) not granting him any delay,<br>\

He incited, excited, urged, instigated, induced, or<br>\
made, him to haste, hasten, make haste, speed, or<br>\
be quick; (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) and commanded, or bade, him, to haste, &amp;c. (K.) One<br>\
says, أَعْجَلَنِىفَعَجِلْتُ لَهُ [He incited me, &amp;c., to<br>\
haste, &amp;c., and I hasted, &amp;c., to him]. (O, TA.)<br>\
And it is said in the Kur [xiii. 7], ↓ وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ<br>\
بِالسَّيِّئَةِ قَبْلَ الْحَسَنَةِ [And they incite thee to haste<br>\
with that which is evil before that which is good]:<br>\
and [in xxii. 46 and xxix. 53,] ↓ وَيَسْتَعْجِلُونَكَ<br>\

-b2-  اعجلهُ<br>\
signifies also [He incited him to haste, &amp;c., by<br>\

had, got, or took, precedence of him, or it; he<br>\
was, or became, beforehand with him, or it; or<br>\

↓ استعجلهُ: (K:) or ↓ اِسْتَعْجَلْتُهُ signifies I went<br>\
before him, or preceded him, (S, O, TA,) and so incited him to haste: (TA:) and أَمْرَ رَبِّكُمْ ↓ أَعَجِلْتُمْ,<br>\
in the Kur [vii. 149], means أَسَبَقْتُمْ [i. e. Have<br>\
ye anticipated the command of your Lord?]: (S,<br>\
O:) or have ye left [the fulfilment of] the command of your Lord incomplete? (Ksh, Bd;)<br>\
عَجِلَ being made to imply, (Ksh,) or as though<br>\
it were made to imply, (Bd,) the meaning of<br>\
سَبَقَ, wherefore it is made trans. like this latter<br>\
verb; (Ksh, Bd;) the phrase meaning أَعَجِلْتُمْ<br>\
عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّكُمْ. (Ksh.) وَمَا أَعْجَلَكَ عَنْ قَوْمِكَ, in<br>\
the Kur [xx. 85, lit. And what caused thee to<br>\
hasten from thy party?], means [virtually] كَيْفَ<br>\
سَبَقْتَهُمْ [i. e. how is it that thou camest before thy<br>\
party?]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  One says also, اعجل الشَّىْءَ<br>\

or hurriedly, or he hurried it, before, or so as to<br>\
prevent, its becoming mature]. (S and K * in art.<br>\
فطر.) And أَعْجَلْتُهُ عَنِ اسْتِلَالِ سَيْفِهِ i. e. ↓ عَجِلْتُ<br>\
بِهِ [I was quick, or beforehand, with him, and] I<br>\
flurried him, so that he could not draw his sword:<br>\
whence the saying, رَأَى صَيْدًا فَرَكِبَ فَرَسَهُ وَأُعْجِلَ<br>\
عَنْ حَرْبَتِهِ أَوْ سَوْطِهِ [He saw an animal of the<br>\
chase, and he mounted his horse, or mare, and was<br>\
incited by haste so as to be prevented from taking<br>\
his dart or his whip]: and the saying, هَلَاكُ المَالِ<br>\
أَعْجَلَهُ عَنْ أَدَائِهَا, meaning مَنَعَهُ [i. e. The perishing of the cattle, or property, prevented, or precluded, him from paying it], namely, the زَكَاة [or<br>\
poor-rate]; which is an instance of the extension<br>\
of the signification. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  أَعْجَلَتْ said of<br>\
the pregnant, (O,) or of a she-camel, (K,) [as<br>\
though for اعجلت وَلَدَهَا,] She brought forth,<br>\
(O,) or cast, (K,) her offspring before its maturity. (O, K.) ―<br>\

تَعَجَّلَ as intrans.: see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
تعجّل الحَرُّ The heat came speedily, or quickly.<br>\
(Mgh.) And تعجّل الثَّمَنُ [The price was, or<br>\

الشَّىْءَ He desired, or required, or demanded, the<br>\
thing&#39;s being speedy, or quick, not waiting patiently<br>\
until its time, or full time. (Ham p. 665.) See<br>\

عُجْلٌ: see عُجَالَةٌ.<br>\
عِجْلٌ A calf the young one of the بَقَرَة, (Aboo-Kheyreh, S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) [both domestic<br>\
and wild, which latter is a bovine antelope,] from<br>\
the time when his mother brings him forth (Aboo-Kheyreh, Mgh, TA) until a month old; (Aboo-Kheyreh, Mgh, Msb, TA;) after which [accord.<br>\
to some] he is called بَرْغَزٌ, when about two months<br>\
old; and then he is called فَرْقَدٌ: (Aboo-Kheyreh,<br>\
TA:) or he is thus called while in the first year,<br>\
then تَبِيعٌ, (S and Sgh and K in art. سلغ,) or,<br>\
correctly, accord. to IB, he is called while in the<br>\
first year عِجْلٌ and تَبِيعٌ, (TA in that art.,) then<br>\
جَذَعٌ, then ثَنِىٌّ, then رَبَاعٍ, then سَدِيسٌ, then سَالِغُ<br>\
سَنَةٍ and سَالِغُ سَنَتَيْنِ and so on: (S and Sgh and<br>\
K ibid.:) the fem. is with ة: (Abu-l-Jarráh,<br>\
S, O, Msb:) pl. of the masc. عِجَلَةٌ (Mgh, Msb)<br>\
and عُجُولٌ (Msb, TA) and, of pauc., أَعْجِلَةٌ and<br>\
أَعْجَالٌ; (IB, TA;) [and of the fem. عِجَلٌ;] but<br>\
as to عِجَالٌ as a pl., [Mtr says,] I have not heard<br>\
it: (Mgh:) and ↓ عِجَّوْلٌ signifies the same as<br>\
عِجْلٌ; (S, Mgh, O, K;) fem. with ة; (TA;)<br>\
and pl. عَجَاجِيلُ. (S, Mgh, O, K.)<br>\
عَجَلٌ and ↓ عَجَلَةٌ, both inf. ns. of عَجِلَ [q. v.],<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) are Syn. with سُرْعَةٌ; (K;) contr. of<br>\
بُطْءٌ: (S, O:) the latter is expl. by Th as signifying the seeking, and pursuing, or endeavouring<br>\
after, a thing before its proper time, or season;<br>\
and as proceeding from the desire of the soul;<br>\
wherefore it is generally discommended in the<br>\
Kur-án, so that it is said to be from the Devil.<br>\
(TA.) It is said in the Kur [xxi. 38], خُلِقَ<br>\
الْإِنْسَانُ مِنْ عَجَلٍ, meaning, it is said, Man is<br>\
composed of haste; (O;) so says Fr, and in like<br>\
manner says Aboo-Is-hák; (T, TA;) to denote<br>\
the excess of this attribute in him: (T, O, TA:)<br>\
or, accord. to Th, (TA,) the phrase is inverted,<br>\
the meaning being, haste is created from man;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) but IJ disapproves this explanation,<br>\
and also another which will be mentioned in what<br>\
follows. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَجَلٌ signifies also Food that<br>\
is hastily prepared, and brought, before the [meal<br>\
called] غَدَآء has become matured. (TA.) [See<br>\
also عُجَّالٌ.]<br>\
-A3-  Also Clay, or earth; syn. طِينٌ:<br>\
(IAar, O, K:) or black mud, or black fetid mud;<br>\
syn. حَمْأَةٌ: and ↓ عَجَلَةٌ has both of these meanings, i. e. طِينٌ and حَمْأَةٌ: (O, * K:) the former<br>\
of these two significations of عَجَلٌ is said by AO<br>\
to be of the dial. of Himyer; and IAar says that<br>\
it is what is meant in the phrase in the Kur<br>\
[xxi. 38] cited above; but Ibn-&#39;Arafeh disapproves<br>\
this; (O, TA;) and so does Az; and Er-Rághib<br>\
says that some expl. it as meaning in this instance<br>\
stinking black mud, but that their saying is nought.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A4-  See also عَجَلَةٌ, in four places.<br>\

↓ عَجِيلٌ (K) and ↓ عَجْلَانُ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K)<br>\
Hasting, hastening, making haste, or speeding;<br>\
[thus more properly the first and second, and<br>\
often the last; the rest generally signifying]<br>\
hasty, speedy, quick, or expeditious: (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, * K:) pls., (K, TA,) all of ↓ عَجْلَانُ, (TA,)<br>\
عَجَالَى and عُجَالَى and عِجَالٌ; (K, TA;) the<br>\
first and last of which pls., as pls. of عَجْلَى [fem.<br>\
of عَجْلَانُ], are applied to women (S, O, TA)<br>\
also: (TA:) عَجِلٌ has no broken pl., nor has<br>\
↓ عَجُلٌ: (Sb, TA:) ISk says that, for the dim.<br>\
of عَجِلٌ, they use ↓ عُجَيْلَانُ, as formed from<br>\
عَجْلَانُ; though they also form it regularly,<br>\
saying ↓ عُجَيْلٌ; but the former is the better.<br>\
(O, TA.)<br>\
عُجْلَةٌ: see عُجَالَةٌ.<br>\
عِجْلَةٌ fem. of عِجْلٌ [q. v.]. (Abu-l-Jarráh,<br>\

A species of plant, (S, O, K, TA,) which extends<br>\
along the ground, (TA,) also called وَشِيجٌ [q. v.]:<br>\
(O, TA:) AHn says of the وشيج, on the authority of Aboo-Ziyád, it grows, at first, from one<br>\
root, then branches forth upon the surface of the<br>\
earth, in innumerable branches, every branch<br>\
having a knot, or joint, (كَعْبٌ,) from which<br>\
knot, or joint, grow other branches; it cleaves<br>\
to the ground, not rising high; its leaves are like<br>\
those of wheat; and while green, it is called<br>\
عِجْلَة; (O;) and it is the best of pasture, and<br>\
is not [what is termed] a بَقْل: (O, TA:) and it<br>\
is said to be a tree having leaves and joints, or<br>\
knots, (كُعُوب,) and pliant canes, [for قضب in<br>\
my original, I read قَصَب, (see وَشِيجٌ,)] long,<br>\
or elongated, with a fruit like the foot of the<br>\
domestic fowl, contracted, which, when it dries<br>\
