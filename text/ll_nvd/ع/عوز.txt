عَوِزَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
عَوَزَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
عَوَزٌ, (S, O, Msb,) It (a thing) was, or became,<br>\
wanting; not found; or not existing: (S, O, K:)<br>\
or it (anything) was wanted, and desired, but not<br>\
attainable: (Lth, O:) or it was, or became, unattainable; not found; or not existing. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  The same verb, inf. n. as above, is also said<br>\
of flesh, or flesh-meat; [app. signifying It became<br>\
wasted; or it was, or became, wanting, or not<br>\
found;] (A;) or the verb thus used is ↓ أَعْوَزَ,<br>\
inf. n. إِعْوَازٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also It (an affair) was,<br>\
or became, hard, difficult, or strait; (O, K, * TA;)<br>\
and ↓ اعوز it (a thing) was, or became, difficult.<br>\
(IKtt.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And He (a man) was, or became,<br>\
poor, needy, or indigent; (S, A, O, K;) as also<br>\
↓ اعوز, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِعْوَازٌ: (S, Msb;:)<br>\
or the latter signifies he was, or became, poor so<br>\
as to possess nothing; (AZ, Msb;) or he became<br>\
in want, and in an unsound condition; (A;) as<br>\
also ↓ اعوزّ, (A, TA,) inf. n. اِعْوِزَازٌ; (TA;) or in<br>\
an evil condition. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَازَ الشَّىْءَ, aor. يَعُوزُ,<br>\
[inf. n. عَوْزٌ,] He wanted, needed, or required, the<br>\
thing, and found it not. (Msb.) [And عَازَهُ الشَّىْءُ,<br>\
and أَعْوَزَهُ, virtually signify the same.] See 4.<br>\
4<br>\
اعوز, inf. n. إِعْوَازٌ: see عَوِزَ, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  اعوزهُ الدَّهْرُ Fortune caused him to became in<br>\
want, or need; (S, O, K;) or rendered him poor;<br>\
(A, Msb;) [i. e.,] poverty befell him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
اعوزهُ الشَّىْءُ [lit., The thing caused him to want;<br>\
meaning] he wanted, needed, or required, the<br>\
thing, [or had it not,] (S, O, K,) and was unable<br>\
to attain it: (S, K:) and the thing escaped him,<br>\
so that he was unable to attain it, (M, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
it being much wanted by him; (M, TA;) as also<br>\
الشَّىْءُ ↓ عَازَهُ: (M, TA:) or the latter, [virtually,<br>\
like عَازَ الشَّىْءَ,] he found not the thing: (O, K,<br>\
TA:) but Az says that this latter phrase is not<br>\
known. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The thing was little, or<br>\
scarce, or scanty, to him, or in his estimation,<br>\
and needful to him. (Mgh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اعوزهُ الأَمْرُ<br>\
The affair was hard, or difficult, to him. (A,<br>\
TA.) So in the saying, مَسْأَلَةٌ يَخْتَلِفُ فِيهَا كِبَارُ<br>\
الصَّحَابَةِ يُعْوِزُ فِقْهُهَا [A question respecting which<br>\
the great men of the Companions differ;] the<br>\
knowledge whereof is difficult. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A3-  And<br>\
one says, مَا يُعْوِزُ لِفُلَانٍ شَىْءٌ إِلَّا ذَهَبَ بِهِ A thing<br>\
does not come within sight of such a one but he<br>\
takes it away: (Ibn-Háni, O, K:) a saying disapproved by As, but held by AZ to be correct,<br>\
[thus said by him with ز, (TA,)] and heard from<br>\
the Arabs. (O.) [See also أَعْوَرَ, with ر.]<br>\

إِعْوَزَّ see 1, latter part.<br>\
عَوْزٌ The berries of the grape-vine [i. e. grapes;<br>\
العَوْزُ being expl. as signifying حَبُّ العِنَبِ]: n. un.<br>\
with ة. (O, K.) خَرَطْتُ العُنْقُودَ, (O,) or العِنَبَ,<br>\
(TA,) is expl. by AHeyth as said when one takes,<br>\
(O,) or strips off, (TA,) the عَوْز (O, TA) that<br>\
are upon the عنقود [or bunch], (O,) or that are<br>\
upon the عنب [or grape-vine], (TA,) with all his<br>\
fingers, (O, TA,) so as to clear it of its عوز, (O,)<br>\
or so as to clear them from the عُود [or stalk]<br>\
thereof. (TA.)<br>\
عَوَزٌ inf. n. of عَوِزَ [q. v.] (S, O, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[As a simple subst.,] Want; need; exigency;<br>\
(A, O, K;) in which sense مَعَاوِزُ may be an<br>\
irreg. pl. thereof similar to مَلَامِحُ and مَشَابِهُ:<br>\
(Har p. 26:) destitution: (TA:) poverty: (A:)<br>\
evilness of condition: (TA:) littleness, or scarceness, or scantiness, of a thing, to a person, or in<br>\
his estimation, and its needfulness to him: (Lth, *<br>\
Mgh, TA: *) straitness, or difficulty, of a thing.<br>\
(TA.) You say, أَصَابَهُ عَوَزٌ Want, and poverty,<br>\
befell him. (A.) And hence the saying, سِدَادٌ<br>\
مِنْ عَوَزٍ, (A, Mgh, TA,) a well-known prov.,<br>\
expl. in art. سد. (TA.)<br>\
عَوِزٌ Poor; needy; indigent: (K, in this art.<br>\
and in art. لوز:) and ↓ مُعْوِزٌ signifies the same;<br>\
(S, TA;) possessing little; and in an evil condition, as also ↓ مِعْوَزٌ, (O, TA,) which latter is<br>\
anomalous. (TA.) You say, إِنَّهُ لَعَوِزٌ لَوِزٌ Verily<br>\
he is poor indeed: the last word being an imitative sequent, (K, in this art. and in art. لوز,) and<br>\
a corroborative. (TA.)<br>\
مُعْوِزٌ: see عَوِزٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  هٰذَا شَىْءٌ مُعْوِزٌ This is a<br>\
thing that is rare; scarce; hardly to be found:<br>\
(TA:) or not to be found. (A.)<br>\
مِعْوَزٌ: see عَوِزٌ.<br>\
-A2-  An old and worn-out garment or piece of cloth, that is worn in service and<br>\
in labouring; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ مِعْوَزَةٌ: (O, K:)<br>\
because such is worn by the poor: (O, K, TA:)<br>\
wherefore it has the form of an instrumental<br>\
noun: (TA:) and the latter, any garment, or<br>\
piece of cloth, with which another is preserved:<br>\
or a new garment or piece of cloth, accord. to AZ:<br>\
(TA:) but this is [said to be] a mistake ascribed to<br>\
AZ: (O:) pl. of the former, مَعَاوِزُ; (S, O, K;<br>\
[see also عَوَزٌ;]) and of ↓ the latter, مَعَاوِزَةٌ, with ة<br>\
added to corroborate the fem. character. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also The piece of rag which a woman holds<br>\
when wailing for the dead. (TA, voce عَذَبٌ.)<br>\
مِعْوَزَةٌ: see مِعْوَزٌ, in two places.<br>\
