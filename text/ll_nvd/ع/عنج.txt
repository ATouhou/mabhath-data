عَنَجٌ a subst. from عَنَجَ البَعِيرَ; (S, O, K; *) [A<br>\
certain mode of training, or breaking, a camel;<br>\
(see the verb;)] whence the prov., عَوْدٌ يُعَلَّمُ العَنَجَ<br>\
(S, O, TA) An old camel that is trained, or broken,<br>\
and forced back upon his hind legs: (TA:) [or<br>\

he has become old. (O, * TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also An old<br>\
man; a dial. var. of غَنَجٌ: (K:) or a man in<br>\
the dial. of Hudheyl; (O, TA; [in the former<br>\

knowledge reference is made, and I know not<br>\
what is the truth thereof. (TA.) ―<br>\

meaning each of two side-posts,] at the door of<br>\
the [women&#39;s camel-vehicle called] هودج, (O, K,<br>\

O, K,) or that is put beneath the دلو, (A,) and<br>\
then tied to the cross-pieces of wood (العَرَاقِى), (S,<br>\
A, O, K,) or to the loops, (TA,) so that it serves<br>\
as an aid to the cross-pieces of wood and to the<br>\
[thongs called] وَذَم [which bind those cross-pieces<br>\
to the loops of the bucket]; for when these [thongs]<br>\
break, it holds fast the دلو: (S, O:) and when the<br>\
دلو is light, (S, O, K,) it is a string, (S, O,) or a<br>\
light string, (K,) that is tied from one of the loops<br>\
to one of the cross-pieces of wood (العراقى): (S, O,<br>\
K:) or, as some say, a loop in the lower part of<br>\
the bucket, inside it, which is tied by a cord or the<br>\
like to the upper part of the [rope called] كَرَب<br>\
[q. v.], so that if the rope [meaning the كرب,<br>\
not the main rope,] break, it keeps the bucket<br>\
from falling in the well: this is when the bucket<br>\
is light: pl. [of pauc.] أَعْنِجَةٌ and [of mult.] عُنُجٌ.<br>\
(TA.) One says, لَا بُدَّ لِلدَّآءِ مِنْ عِلَاجٍ وَلِلدِّلَآءِ مِنْ<br>\

شَدُّوا العِنَاجَ وَشَدُّوا فَوْقَهُ الكَرَبَا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [A people who, when they conclude a covenant<br>\
with their neighbour, (lit. tie a knot to their neighbour,) tie the عناج, and tie above it the كرب: i. e.<br>\
make it doubly sure]. (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence<br>\
also,] قَوْلٌ لَا عِنَاجَ لَهُ (tropical:)  The support, or foundation, of<br>\
the affair; that upon which the affair rests, or<br>\
whereby it subsists. (A, O, L, TA. [In the K,<br>\
وَالأَمْرُ وَمِلَاكُهُ is erroneously put for وَمِنَ الأَمْرِ<br>\
مِلَاكُهُ; as is said in the TA.]) Thus in the<br>\
saying, لَا أَدْرِى لِأَمْرِكَ عِنَاجًا (assumed tropical:)  [I know not any<br>\
foundation to thine affair]. (O.) And عِنَاجُ<br>\
الأَمْرِ إِلَى أَىِ سُفْيَانَ, occurring in a trad., means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The management of the affair pertained to<br>\
Aboo-Sufyán; he being to his companions like<br>\
the عناج that bears the weight of the bucket.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عِنَاجٌ signifies also A thing with which<br>\
one draws, or pulls. (TA.) ―<br>\

―<br>\
-b7-  Also Pain of the صُلْب [meaning back-bone,<br>\
or loins,] (O, K) and of the joints. (O.)<br>\
عَنَاجٍ and عَنَاجِى: see عُنْجُوجٌ.<br>\
أَعْلِ عَنِّجْ occurs in a trad. as a saying of Aboo-Jahl to Ibn-Mes&#39;ood, when the latter put his foot<br>\
upon the back of the former&#39;s neck; meaning أَعْلِ<br>\
عَنِّى [Rise thou from me]; the ى being changed<br>\
into ج. (TA. [See art. ج.])<br>\

sweet-smelling plants; (O, TA;) said to be the<br>\

عُنْجُوجٌ sing. of عَنَاجِيجُ, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, O,)<br>\
which signifies Fleet, or swift, and excellent, horses<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, S, O, K) and camels; (K;) sometimes applied to the latter: (Lth, TA:) or horses<br>\
that excite the admiration and approval of the<br>\
beholder: and ↓ عَنَاجٍ occurs in a verse cited by<br>\
IAar, as some relate it; and ↓ عَنَاجِى as others<br>\
relate it; the former for عَنَاجِج, and the latter for<br>\
عَنَاجِيج: (TA:) or long-necked horses (O, TA)<br>\
