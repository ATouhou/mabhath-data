load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'عرفجعَرْفَجٌ A certain plant, (S,) or a sort of trees<br>\
[or shrubs], (K,) growing in plain, or soft, land:<br>\
n. un. with ة: (S, K:) it is said to be of the trees<br>\
[or shrubs] of the صَيْف [meaning either spring or<br>\
summer], soft, or pliable, dust-coloured, and having<br>\
a rough produce like the حَسَك [or prickly heads<br>\
of thistles and similar plants]: (TA:) Aboo-Ziyád says, (O, TA,) as related by AHn, (O,)<br>\
that it is of sweet, or pleasant, odour, dustcoloured, inclining to greenness, having a yellow<br>\
blossom; (O, TA;) and when it becomes aggregated and abundant in a place, that place is called<br>\
حَوْمَانٌ: (O:) it has no grains nor thorns: (O,<br>\
TA:) it and the ثُمَام and the ضَعَة grow in plain,<br>\
or soft, land, and on the mountain; and none of<br>\
these has thorns: its firewood is the best of firewood in odour, and the quickest in taking fire and<br>\
in blazing: (O:) AHn [also] says, certain of the<br>\
Arabs of the desert informed me that its root is<br>\
wide, occupying a [considerable] piece of ground;<br>\
and it sends forth many shoots, proportionate to<br>\
the root, without leaves, [but see خُوصٌ,] being<br>\
only slender shoots, at the extremities whereof are<br>\
[buds, or the like, such as are termed] زَمَع, at the<br>\
heads of which appears a yellow substance like<br>\
hair: and he says that, accord. to the ancient<br>\
Arabs of the desert, it occupies a space like that<br>\
of a man sitting, becomes white when it dries up,<br>\
has a yellow produce, is eaten in the fresh and<br>\
dry state by the camels and sheep or goats, and its<br>\
flame is intensely red, whence one says, كَأَنَّ لِحْيَتَهُ<br>\
ضِرَامُ عَرْفَجَةٍ or عَرْفَجٍ [As though his beard were<br>\
the blazing, or flaming, of an &#39;arfajeh or of &#39;arfaj].<br>\
(TA.) The fire of the عرفج is called نَارُ الزَّحْفَتَيْنِ<br>\
[The fire of the two walks]; because he who<br>\
kindles it walks to it, and when it burns up he<br>\
walks from it: (T, TA:) or because it quickly<br>\
blazes and quickly subsides; so when it blazes<br>\
they walk from it, and when it subsides they<br>\
walk to it. (O. [See also art. زحف.]) When<br>\
the greenness of plants appears in it, it is termed<br>\
عَرْفَجَةٌ خَاضِبَةٌ. (Aboo- &#39;Obeyd El-Bekree, TA.)<br>\
When it has been rained upon, and its stalk has<br>\
become soft, one says ثَقَّبَ عُودُ العَرْفَجِ: when it<br>\
has become somewhat black, قَمِلَ: when a little<br>\
more so, اِرْقَاطَّ: when more so, أَدْبَى: and when<br>\
its خُوص are perfect, أَخْوَصَ. (AA, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
كَمَنِّ الغَيْثِ عَلَى العَرْفَجَةِ [Like the benefit conferred by the rain upon the &#39;arfajeh], meaning<br>\
its falling upon it when dry, and causing it to<br>\
become green, is a prov., said, accord. to AZ, to<br>\
him upon whom thou hast conferred a benefit and<br>\
who says to thee, Dost thou confer a benefit upon<br>\
me? (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  لَىُّ العَرْفَجَةِ signifies A certain<br>\
mode of coïtus. (O, K.)<br>\
عَرَافِجُ Sands in which is no road. (O, K. [In<br>\
the latter it is expl. as though it were a proper<br>\
name.])<br>\
