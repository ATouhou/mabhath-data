عَرُضَ, aor.<br>\
عَرُضَ, inf. n. عِرَضٌ, [instead of which,<br>\
as a simple subst., عَرْضٌ is generally used,] and<br>\
عَرَاضَةٌ, It was, or became, broad, or wide; (S, O, *<br>\
Msb, K, TA;) as also ↓ اعرض, (A, TA,) which<br>\
occurs in this sense in two exs. following. (TA.)<br>\
[And in like manner, ↓ استعرض It grew, or spread,<br>\
wide; said of a tree; opposed to طَالَ; occurring<br>\
in the TA in art. بهل.] It is said in a prov.,<br>\
القِرْفَةُ ↓ أَعْرَضَتِ (S, O, * TA [but in two copies of<br>\
the S, I find the verb in this instance written<br>\
اعرضتُ, and in the O اعرضتَ, and I do not know<br>\
that the reading in the TA, which seems to be the<br>\
common one, is found in any copy of the S,])<br>\
Suspicion became, or has become, wide; syn.<br>\
اِتَّسَعَت: (TA:) used when it is said to a man,<br>\
“ Whom dost thou suspect ? ” and he answers,<br>\
“ The sons of such a one,” referring to the whole<br>\
tribe. (S, O, TA.) [See Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov.<br>\
ii. 112, where another reading is mentioned,<br>\
which, by what he says, is shown to be أَعْرَضْتَ<br>\
القِرْفَةَ Thou hast made suspicion wide.] In another prov. it is said, ثَوْبُ المَلْبَسِ ↓ أَعْرَضَ (IAar,<br>\
A, TA, and K in art. لبس,) and المِلْبَسِ and<br>\
المُلْبِسِ (IAar, and K in art. لبس,) and المُلْتَبِسِ<br>\
(TA in art. لبس) i. e. صَارَ ذَا عَرْضٍ, (A, TA,) and<br>\
عَرُضَ, and اِتَّسَعَ; (Sh;) [meaning the same as<br>\
the prov. before mentioned;] used with reference<br>\
to him whose suspicion has become wide; (IAar,<br>\
and TA in art. لبس;) i. e. with reference to him<br>\
who suspects many persons (IAar, Az, and K in<br>\
art. لبس,) of a theft; (IAar, Az, and TA in that<br>\
art.;) or of saying a thing: (TS, and TA in<br>\
that art.:) or when thou askest a person respecting a thing and he does not explain it to thee.<br>\
(TA in that art.) [See, again, Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov. ii. 100, where it is said that أَعْرَضَ ثَوْبُ<br>\
المُلْبِسِ app. means The garment of the suspected<br>\
appeared, or has appeared: but that another<br>\
reading is عَرُضَ, meaning became, or has become,<br>\
wide.]<br>\
-A2-  عَرَضَ, aor.<br>\
عَرِضَ, (Fr, S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
عَرْضٌ; (TA:) and عَرِضَ, (As, TS, K,) aor.<br>\
عَرَضَ,<br>\
(Fr, K,) or<br>\
عَرِضَ, like حَسِبَ, aor.<br>\
عَرِضَ, deviating from<br>\
the general rule; (As, TS;) It (a thing) appeared,<br>\
or became apparent, لَهُ to him; (S, O, Msb, K;<br>\
[but in some copies of the K, instead of the explanation ظَهَرَ وَبَدَا, we find ظَهَرَ عَلَيْهِ وَبَدَا, which<br>\
is a mistake;]) as also ↓ اعرض, (Fr, S, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) which is a deviation from a general rule,<br>\
being quasi pass. of عَرَضَهُ, which see below; (S, *<br>\
O, * Msb, K;) [lit.] it showed its breadth, or<br>\
width. (O, * TA.) You say, لَكَ الشَّىْءُ ↓ اعرض<br>\
مِنْ بَعِيدٍ The thing appeared to thee from afar.<br>\
(TA.) And عَرَضَتْ لَهُ الغُولُ, and عَرِضَتْ, (AZ,<br>\
S, O, K,) The ghool appeared to him. (K.) The<br>\
Arabs say, of a thing, عَرَضَ and ↓ اعرض and<br>\
↓ تعرّض and ↓ اعترض, using these verbs as syn.;<br>\
(Sh;) [app. as meaning It showed, presented, or<br>\
offered, itself, (lit. its breadth, or width, or its<br>\
side, see 5,) to a person: the first and last also<br>\
often signify, and the others sometimes, he obtruded himself in an affair; interfered therein:]<br>\
IKt disallows ↓ اعرض in the sense of اعترض, as<br>\
not having been found by him: (TA:) [but] an<br>\
instance of the former of these two verbs used in<br>\
the sense of the latter of them occurs in the phrase<br>\
لِلنَّاظِرِينَ ↓ إِذَا أُعْرَضَتْ [app. meaning When she<br>\
shows, or presents, herself to the lookers], in a<br>\
poem by one of the tribe of Teiyi. (Sh.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
عَرَضَ لَكَ الخَيْرُ, [in one place in the TA الخَبَرَ,<br>\
and الخبر in a copy of the Msb,] inf. n. عَرْضٌ;<br>\
(TA; [in one place in the TA عُرُوضٌ there referring to الخَبَرُ, which is app. a mistranscription;])<br>\
and ↓ اعرض; (S, O, K, TA;) Good [i. e. the<br>\
doing of good] hath become within thy power, or<br>\
practicable to thee, or easy to thee. (S, O, K,<br>\
TA.) And لَكَ الظَّبْىُ ↓ اعرض The gazelle hath<br>\
exposed to thee its side; (TA;) or hath put its<br>\
side in thy power, (S, O, K, TA,) by turning it<br>\
towards thee: (O, TA:) said to incite one to<br>\
shoot it, or cast at it. (S, O.) Or لَكَ ↓ اعرض,<br>\
said of an animal of the chase, or other thing,<br>\
signifies It hath put in thy power, [or exposed to<br>\
thee,] its breadth, or width: (A:) or لَهُ ↓ اعرض<br>\
signifies it (a thing) became within his power, or<br>\
practicable to him, or easy to him; lit., it showed<br>\
its side [to him]. (Mgh.) [In the TA, I find<br>\
أَعْرَضَ فِى الشَّىْءِ expl. as signifying He had the<br>\
width of the thing in his power: but فى, here,<br>\
seems to be a mistake for لَهُ.] A poet, also, says<br>\
↓ أَعْرِضِى addressing a woman; meaning أَمْكِنِى<br>\
[Empower thou; i. e. grant thou access]. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  عَرَضَ لَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَرِضَ; (As, S, K, TA;) and عَرِضَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَرَضَ; (TA;) are also said of an event, (As, TA,)<br>\
or of a disease, and the like, (S, K, TA,) such as<br>\
disquietude of mind, and a state of distraction of<br>\
the mind or attention; (TA;) [meaning It happened to him; it befell him; it occurred to him;<br>\
was incident to him;] and also of doubt, and the<br>\
like. (TA.) [So, too, is ↓ اعترض.] You also say,<br>\
عَرَضَهُ عَارِضٌ مِنَ الحُمَّى وَنَحْوِهَا [An occurrence<br>\
of fever, and the like, happened to him, or befell<br>\
him]. (S.) And البَدَنَ ↓ اعترض [It befell the<br>\
body] is said of [a disease, as, for instance,] the<br>\
mange, or scab. (B, in TA in art. عر.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عَرَضَ<br>\
لَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَرِضَ; (Msb, TA;) and عَرِضَ له, aor,<br>\
عَرَضَ; (Msb;)<br>\
He intervened as an obstacle to him, preventing<br>\
him from attaining his desire, (Msb, TA, *) or<br>\
from seeking to attain his desire, and from going<br>\
his way; (TA;) as also له ↓ اعترض. (Msb.) You<br>\
say also, عَرَضَ لَهُ أَشَدَّ العَرْضِ, and ↓ اعترض, He<br>\
opposed himself to him (قَابَلَهُ بِنَفْسِهِ) with the most<br>\
vehement opposition of himself. (TA.) See also 5,<br>\
second sentence. One should not say, عرّضتُ لَهُ,<br>\
with teshdeed, in the sense of اِعْتَرَضْتُ. (Msb.)<br>\
You also say, عَرَضَ عَارِضٌ, meaning [An obstacle<br>\
intervened, or prevented; lit.] an intervening thing<br>\
intervened; a preventing thing prevented. (TA.)<br>\
And سِرْتُ فَعَرَضَ لِى فِى الطَّرِيقِ عَارِضٌ مِنْ جَبَلٍ<br>\
وَنَحْوِهِ I journeyed, and there opposed itself to me,<br>\
so as to prevent my going on, an obstacle consisting in a mountain, and the like; as also ↓ اعترض:<br>\
whence the اِعْتِرَاضَات [or objections] of the lawyers; because they prevent one&#39;s laying hold<br>\
upon the evidence. (Msb.) And عَرَضَ لَهُ الشَّىْءُ<br>\
فِى الطَّرِيقِ The thing intervened as an obstacle to<br>\
him in the way, preventing him from going on.<br>\
(TA.) And عَرَضَ الشَّىْءُ The thing stood up and<br>\
prevented; [or stood in the way, or presented<br>\
itself as an obstacle; or opposed itself;] as also<br>\
↓ اعترض. (TA.) [And The thing lay, or extended, breadthwise, or across, or athwart; like<br>\
اعترض, q. v.] And الشَّىْءُ دُونَ الشَّىْءِ ↓ اعترض<br>\
The thing intervened as an obstacle in the way to<br>\
the thing; syn. حَالَ. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b5-  مَا عَرَضْتُ لَهُ<br>\
بِسُوْءٍ, aor.<br>\
عَرِضَ; and ما عَرِضْتُ, aor.<br>\
عَرَضَ; signify ما<br>\
تَعَرَّضْتُ: see 5: or, as some say, I did not, or<br>\
have not, become exposed to his reviling, or evilspeaking, by reviling, or speaking evil, of him.<br>\
(Msb.) [See also عَرَضَ عِرْضَهُ, below.] ―<br>\
-b6-  عَرَضَ<br>\
لَهُ also signifies He went towards him; (TA in<br>\
art. نحو;) and عَرَضَ عَرْضَهُ and عُرْضَهُ [the same,<br>\
i. e.] نَحَا نَحْوَهُ; (K;) as also عرضه ↓ اعترض<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  In the saying of El-Kumeyt,<br>\
فَأَبْلِغْ يَزِيدَ إِنْ عَرَضْتَ وَمُنْذِرًا<br>\
he means [And convey thou to Yezeed,] if thou<br>\
pass by him, [and to Mundhir: or perhaps, if<br>\
thou go to him: or if thou present thyself to him.]<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b8-  عَرَضَ الفَرَسُ, (L, K,) aor.<br>\
عَرِضَ, inf. n. عَرْضٌ,<br>\
(L, TA,) The horse went along inclining towards<br>\
one side: (K, TA:) or ran inclining his breast<br>\
and head: (L, TA:) and ran inclining his head<br>\
and neck; (K; [in which only the inf. n. of the<br>\
verb in this last sense is mentioned;]) the doing<br>\
of which is approved in horses, but disapproved<br>\
in camels. (TA.) [See also 3, and 5.] ―<br>\
-b9-  عَرَضَ<br>\
البَعِيرُ, (K,) inf. n. عَرْضٌ, (TA,) The camel ate of<br>\
the أَعْرَاض, i. e. of the upper parts of the trees [or<br>\
shrubs]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b10-  عَرَضَتْ, said of a she-camel, A<br>\
fracture, (S, O, K,) or some injurious accident,<br>\
(S, O,) befell her; (S, O, K;) as also عَرِضَتْ;<br>\
(O, K;) but the former is the more approved:<br>\
(TA:) and عَرَضَ لَهَا a disease, or a fracture,<br>\
befell her. (TA, from a trad.) Also, said of a<br>\
sheep, or goat, (شاة,) It died by disease. (K.) And<br>\
عَرِضَ الشَّآءُ The sheep, or goats, burst, or became<br>\
rent, from abundance of herbage. (K.) And<br>\
عَرَضَ, (IKtt,) inf. n. عَرْضٌ, (K,) He (an animal,<br>\
IKtt, or a man, K, [but it is said in the TA that<br>\
there is no reason for this restriction,]) died without disease. (IKtt, K.) ―<br>\
-b11-  عَرَضَ بِسِلْعَتِهِ i. q.<br>\
عَارَضَ بِهَا. (K.) See 3, in two places. [And<br>\
under the same, see a similar phrase.] ―<br>\
-b12-  عَرَضَ<br>\
He (a man, S, O) came to العَرُوض, i. e. Mekkeh<br>\
and El-Medeeneh, (S, O, K, TA,) and El-Yemen,<br>\
(TA,) and what is around them. (S, O, K, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  عَرَضَ الشَّىْءَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
عَرِضَ, inf. n. عَرْضٌ,<br>\
(Msb,) He made the thing apparent; showed it;<br>\
exhibited it; manifested it; exposed it to view;<br>\
presented it; (S, O, Msb, K;) unfolded it; laid<br>\
it open: and also he mentioned it: (Msb:)<br>\
[lit. he showed its breadth, or width, or its side:<br>\
and hence it also signifies he made the thing to<br>\
stand as an obstacle, دُونَ شَىْءٍ in the way to, or<br>\
of, a thing.] You say, عَرَضَ لَهُ الشَّىْءَ He made<br>\
apparent, showed, exhibited, manifested, or exposed<br>\
to view, to him the thing; (S, O, K;) unfolded it,<br>\
or laid it open, to him. (S, TA.) And عَرَضَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ أَمْرَ كَذَا (S, O, K *) He showed, propounded,<br>\
or proposed, to him, such a thing, or such a case:<br>\
(K, * TA:) [and he asked, or required, of him,<br>\
with gentleness, the doing of such a thing; for]<br>\
العَرْضُ signifies طَلَبٌ بِلِينٍ, (Mughnee and K,<br>\
voce أَلَا,) or طَلَبٌ بِلِينٍ وَتَأَدُّبٍ. (Mughnee voce<br>\
لَوْلَا.) And عَرَضْتُ المَتَاعَ لِلْبَيْعِ [I showed, exposed,<br>\
presented, or offered, the commodity for sale; or]<br>\
I showed the commodity to those desirous of purchasing it. (Msb.) The phrase عَرَضَ عَلَيْهِ المَتَاعَ<br>\
[He showed, or offered, to him the commodity] is<br>\
used because the person shows to the other the<br>\
length and breadth of the thing (طُولَهُ وَعَرْضَهُ),<br>\
or because he shows him one of its sides (عُرْضًا<br>\
مِنْ أَعْرَاضِهِ). (Mgh.) [Hence,] it is said in a<br>\
trad. of Hodheyfeh, تُعْرَضُ الفِتَنُ عَلَى القُلُوبِ<br>\
عَرْضَ الحَصِيرِ, which means, accord. to some, that<br>\
فِتَن [Temptations, &amp;c.,] will be [displayed and]<br>\
embellished to the hearts of men like [as] the<br>\
ornamented and variegated garment called حصير<br>\
[is displayed and embellished]: (B, TA in art.<br>\
حصر:) or the meaning is, that they will be laid<br>\
and spread upon the hearts like the حصير: (IAth,<br>\
TA in the present art.:) and some say that by<br>\
this last word is here meant a certain vein extending across upon the side of a beast, towards<br>\
the belly. (TA in art. حصر.) [Hence also,] عَرْضٌ<br>\
سَابِرِىٌّ [A slight exhibition: (see art. سبر:)] so in<br>\
the proverbs by A&#39;Obeyd, in the handwriting of<br>\
Ibn-El-Jawáleekee: (TA:) or عَرْضُ سَابِرِىٍّ: (TA,<br>\
and so in a copy of the S in this art.:) or عَرْضَ<br>\
سَابِرِىٍّ. (O, TA, and so in a copy of the S in this<br>\
art.) With this agrees in meaning the saying<br>\
عَرَضَ عَلَىَّ سَوْمَ عَالَّةٍ [He offered to me in the<br>\
manner of offering water to camels taking a<br>\
second draught: see also arts. سوم and عل; and<br>\
see Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 84]. (TA.) You<br>\
say also, عَرَضْتُ الجَارِيَةَ عَلَى البَيْعِ [I showed, or<br>\
displayed, or exposed, or offered, the girl for<br>\
sale]: (S, O, TA:) and in like manner المَتَاعَ<br>\
[the commodity]. (TA.) And عَرَضْتُ لَهُ ثَوْبًا<br>\
مَكَانَ حَقِّهِ; (S, O;) and عَرَضْتُ لَهُ مِنْ حَقِّهِ ثَوْبًا,<br>\
(S, O, K,) or مَتَاعًا, (TA,) this meaning, [as also<br>\
the former phrase,] I gave to him a garment, or<br>\
piece of cloth, [or a commodity,] in place of his<br>\
due: (S, O, K:) and in like manner, عرضت بِهِ.<br>\
(El-Umawee, TA.) And عَرَضْتُ البَعِيرَ عَلَى<br>\
الحَوْضِ, which is an instance of inversion, meaning عَرَضْتُ الحَوْضَ عَلَى البَعِيرِ [I showed the<br>\
watering-trough to the camel]: (S, O, Msb:) [or<br>\
it agrees in meaning with the phrase] عَرَضَ النَّاقَةَ<br>\
عَلَى الحَوْضِ, and ↓ أَعْرَضَهَا, [as rendered] He<br>\
offered to the she-camel to drink [at the wateringtrough]. (L, TA.) And عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى السَّيْفِ [lit.<br>\
He exposed them to the sword; (see also 2;)<br>\
meaning] he slew them (S, A, O, Msb, K) with<br>\
the sword. (Msb.) And عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى السَّوْطِ He<br>\
beat them with the whip; he flogged them. (K, *<br>\
TA.) And عَرَضَهُمْ عَلَى النَّارِ He burned them.<br>\
(A, TA.) And عَرَضْتُ العَسَلَ عَلَى النَّارِ I cooked<br>\
the honey [upon the fire] to separate it from the<br>\
wax. (Msb.) [And عَرَضَ نَفْسَهُ لِلْهَلَاكِ He exposed himself to destruction.] ―<br>\
-b2-  عَرْضٌ also signifies The bringing a man before a judge, and<br>\
accusing him. (IAar, in TA, art. عقب.) [And<br>\
The presenting, or addressing, a petition, &amp;c.,<br>\
with عَلَى or لِ before the word signifying the<br>\
person to whom it is presented or addressed.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
One says also, مَا يَعْرِضُكَ لِفُلَانٍ, (S, [so in two<br>\
copies,] and O,) or مَا يَعْرُضَكَ, (L, TA,) with fet-h<br>\
to the ى and damm to the ر, (L,) the verb being<br>\
coordinate to نَصَرَ: (TA:) [app. meaning What<br>\
causeth thee to present thyself to such a one?]:<br>\
Yaakoob disallows one&#39;s saying ↓ مَا يُعَرِّضُكَ<br>\
لِفُلَانٍ, with teshdeed. (S, O, TA.) [But the latter<br>\
of these two verbs has a signification nearly allied<br>\
to that which is here assigned to the former, and<br>\
exactly agreeing with one mentioned before. See<br>\
2.] ―<br>\
-b4-  عَرَضَ الجُنْدَ, (S, Msb,) and عَرَضَ الجُنْدَ<br>\
عَرْضَ العَيْنِ, (S, O,) or عَرْضَ عَيْنٍ, (A, K, B,<br>\

to pass by him, and examined their state, (S, O, K,)<br>\
what it was: (S, O:) [i. e. he reviewed them:] or<br>\
he made them to pass before him in review, that<br>\
he might know who was absent and who was present: (A, B:) or he caused them to come forth,<br>\
and examined them, that he might know them:<br>\
(Msb:) and you say also, ↓ اعترضهُمْ, (S, O, K,)<br>\
meaning [the same, or] he made them to pass by<br>\
him, or before him, and examined them, one by<br>\
one, (K, TA,) to see who were absent from those<br>\
who were present. (TA.) You say also, ↓ اعترض<br>\
المَتَاعَ وَنَحْوَهُ and عَلَى عَيْنِهِ ↓ اعترضهُ [He examined the commodity, and the like thereof, having<br>\
it displayed before his eye]. (Th.) [See also عَرْضٌ.]<br>\

(Msb.)<br>\
-A4-  عَرَضَ عِرْضَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَرِضَ; (TA;) and ↓ اعترضهُ;<br>\
(A, TA;) [perhaps originally signified He examined his grounds of pretension to respect, or the<br>\
like: and then became used to express a frequent<br>\
consequence of doing so; i. e.] he spoke evil of<br>\
him; reviled him; detracted from his reputation:<br>\
(A, TA:) or he corresponded to him, or equalled<br>\
him, in grounds of pretension to respect: (TA:)<br>\
[the former seems to be the more probable of the<br>\
two meanings; for it is said that] فُلَانًا ↓ اعترض<br>\
signifies he spoke evil of such a one; reviled him;<br>\
detracted from his reputation; (Lth, S, O, K;)<br>\
and annoyed him. (Lth, TA.)<br>\
-A5-  عَرَضَ الشَّىْءَ,<br>\
(K,) aor.<br>\
عَرِضَ, inf. n. عَرْضٌ, (TA,) He hit the side<br>\

عَرُضَ and<br>\
عَرِضَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) in both<br>\
phrases, (O, K,) [J says, in the S, app. referring,<br>\

He put the stick breadthwise, across, athwart, or<br>\
crosswise, (مَعْرُوضًا, TA, or بِالعَرْضِ, Msb, TA,<br>\
both meaning the same, TA,) upon the vessel,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) [and so the sword upon his thigh:<br>\
and ↓ عرّضهُ signifies the same.] ―<br>\
-b2-  عَرَضَ الرُّمْحَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\

the bow upon its side on the ground, and then shot<br>\

عرّضهُ, inf. n. تَعْرِيضٌ, He made it (a thing)<br>\
broad, or wide; (S, K;) as also ↓ اعرضهُ, (Lth,<br>\

-b2-  See also 1, near<br>\
the end, in three places. ―<br>\
-b3-  تَعَرِيضٌ also signifies<br>\
The speaking obliquely, indirectly, obscurely, ambiguously, or equivocally; contr. of تَصْرِيحٌ; (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) as when thou askest a man,<br>\
“ Hast thou seen such a one? ” and he, having<br>\
seen him, and disliking to lie, answers, “Verily<br>\
such a one is seen: ” (Msb:) or the making a<br>\
phrase, or the like, to convey an allusion, or an<br>\
indication not expressly mentioned therein; as when<br>\
you say “ How foul is niggardliness! ” alluding<br>\
to such a one&#39;s being a niggard (تُعَرِّضُ بِأَنَّهُ<br>\
بَخِيلٌ): differing from كِنَايَةٌ, which is the mentioning of the consequence and meaning that of<br>\
which it is the consequence; as when you say<br>\
“ Such a one has a long suspensory cord to his<br>\
sword, and has many ashes of the cooking-pot; ”<br>\
meaning that he is tall of stature, and one who<br>\
entertains many guests: (Mgh:) [but many hold<br>\
these two words to be identical in meaning.]<br>\
You say, عَرَّضْتُ لِفُلَانٍ and بِفُلَانٍ, i. e. I said<br>\
something [in the manner explained above], meaning such a one. (S, Msb.) [See also an ex. voce<br>\
كَلَّآءٌ.] &#39;Omar defined [or rather explained]<br>\
التَّعْرِيضُ بِالفَاحِشَةِ [The making an allusion to that<br>\
which is foul, or obscene] by the instance of a man<br>\
saying to another “ My father is not an adulterer,<br>\
nor is my mother an adulteress. ” (O, TA.) Or,<br>\
accord. to the early authorities, عرّض signifies<br>\
He used a phrase susceptible of different meanings,<br>\
or an equivocal phrase, by which the hearer understood a meaning different from that which he<br>\
(the speaker) intended: or, accord. to the later<br>\
authorities, as Et-Teftezánee, he mentioned a thing<br>\
by a proper or tropical or metonymical expression,<br>\
to signify some other thing, which he did not mention; as when one says, “I heard him whom<br>\
thou hatest praying for thee, and making good<br>\
mention of thee; ” meaning in his praying for<br>\
the Muslims in general. (El-Munáwee, in explaining the trad. إِنَّ فِى المَعَارِيضِ الخ, which see<br>\
below, voce مِعْرَاضٌ.) تعريض with respect to the<br>\
demanding of a woman in marriage in [the period<br>\
of] her عِدَّة, [during which she may not contract<br>\
a new marriage,] is the using language which<br>\
resembles a demand of her in marriage, but does<br>\
not plainly express it; as the saying to her<br>\
“ Verily thou art beautiful,” or “ Verily there<br>\
is a desire for thee,” or “ Verily women are of<br>\
the things that I need: ” and تعريض is sometimes<br>\
made by the quoting of proverbs, and by the introducing of enigmas in one&#39;s speech. (TA.)<br>\
[When followed by عَلَى, it signifies The making<br>\
an indirect objection against a person or saying<br>\
&amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b4-  Also عرّض, (S, O,) inf. n. as above, (K,)<br>\
He wrote indistinctly; (S, O, K;) not making<br>\
the letters distinct, nor the handwriting rightly<br>\
formed or disposed. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  تَعْرِيضٌ also sigsifies The making a thing to be exposed [or liable]<br>\
to another thing. (K, [It is there expl., with the<br>\
article ال prefixed to it, by the words أَنْ يَجْعَلَ<br>\
لِلشَّىْءِ ↓ الشَّىْءَ عَرْضًا, or ↓ عَرَضًا, accord. to different<br>\
copies; the latter (which see, last sentence but<br>\
one,) app. the right reading; meaning مَعْرُوضًا,<br>\
whichever be the right; for an inf. n. may be<br>\
used in the sense of a pass. part. n.; and many a<br>\
word of the measure فَعَلٌ is used in that sense,<br>\
as, for instance, خَبَطٌ and نَفَضٌ and هَدَمٌ. That<br>\
I have rightly rendered the above-mentioned explanation in the K is indicated by what here immediately follows.]) Hence the trad. مَا عَظُمَتْ<br>\
نِعْمَةُ اللّٰهِ عَلَى عَبْدٍ إِلَّا عَظُمَتْ مَؤُونَةُ النَّاسِ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
فَمَنْ لَمْ يَحْتَمِلْ تِلْكَ المَؤُونَةَ فَقَدْ عَرَّضَ تِلْكَ النِّعْمَةَ<br>\
لِلزَّوَالِ [The blessing of God upon a servant, or<br>\
man, hath not become great but the burden of<br>\
other men upon him hath become great; and he<br>\
who doth not take upon himself that burden causeth<br>\
that blessing to be exposed to cessation]. (O, TA.)<br>\
You also say, هُوَ لَهُ ↓ عَرَّضْتُ فُلَانًا لِكَذَا فَتَعَرَّضَ [I<br>\
caused such a one to expose himself, or I exposed<br>\
him, to such a thing, and he exposed himself, or<br>\
became exposed, to it], (S, O, *) i. e. ↓ جَعَلْتُهُ عَرَضًا<br>\
لِكَذَا. (O.) See also 1, last quarter. ―<br>\

-b4-  And The giving what is termed<br>\
an عُرَاضَة: (TA:) and the feeding with what is<br>\
so termed: (K:) or the giving food of what is so<br>\
termed. (S.) [See also 1, near the end.] It is<br>\
said in a trad., respecting a company of travelling<br>\
merchants making presents to Mohammad and<br>\
Aboo-Bekr, عَرَّضُوهُمَا ثِيَابًا بِيضًا They gave to both<br>\
of them white garments, or pieces of cloth. (L.)<br>\
And you say, عَرَّضُوهُمْ مَحْضًا They gave them to<br>\
drink [unmixed] milk. (TA.) And عَرِّضُونَا Give<br>\
ye to us food of your عُرَاضَة; your wheat, or corn,<br>\
which ye have brought. (S, TA.) ―<br>\

عَارِضَة [i. e. courage, or courage and energy],<br>\
(IAar, O, K,) and strength, or power, (IAar, O,)<br>\
and a faculty of speech, (IAar, O, K,) or, as in<br>\
the Tekmileh, and power of speech. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-<br>\
And He kept continually to the eating of عِرْضَان,<br>\
(O, * K, TA, [in the O عِرَاض,]) pl. of عَرِيضٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A5-  See also 4, last sentence.<br>\
3<br>\
عَاْرَضَ [عَارضهُ has two contr. significations, which<br>\
are unequivocally expressed by saying عارضهُ<br>\
بِالخِلَافِ and عارضهُ بِالوِفَاقِ. (See عَانَدَهُ.) Thus<br>\
one says,] عارضهُ, (Msb,) inf. n. مُعَارَضَةٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He opposed him [being opposed by him]. (Kull<br>\
p. 342.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [He vied, competed, or contended<br>\
for superiority, with him; emulated, rivalled, or<br>\
imitated, him;] he did like as he (the latter) did.<br>\
(Msb, TA.) You say also, عَارَضْتُهُ بِمِثْلِ مَا صَنَعَ,<br>\
(S, O,) or بِمِثْلِ صَنِيعِهِ, (K,) I did to him like<br>\
as he did: (S, O, K:) whence المُعَارَضَة [in trafficking, as will be seen below]: as though the<br>\
breadth (عَرْض) of the action of the one were like<br>\
the breadth of the action of the other. (O, K.)<br>\
And عارضهُ بِمَا صَنَعَهُ He requited him for that<br>\
which he did. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence] مُعَارَضَةٌ also signifies The selling a commodity for another commodity; exchanging it for another; as also عَرْضٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and [in like manner] ↓ تَعْرِيضٌ, the act of<br>\
bartering, or selling a commodity for a like<br>\

عَرِضَ, inf. n. عَرْضٌ;<br>\
(TA;) He exchanged his commodity; giving one<br>\
commodity and taking another; (TA:) and<br>\

commodity giving another in exchange for it.<br>\
(TA.) And when persons demand blood of other<br>\
persons, and they [the latter] do not retaliate for<br>\
them, they [the latter] say, نَحْنُ نَعْرِضُ مِنْهُ [We<br>\

former] accept (اعترضوا) the bloodwit. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
You say also, عَارَضْتُهُ فِى البَيْعِ فَعَرَضْتُهُ [I vied with<br>\
him in endeavouring to defraud, or deceive, in<br>\
selling, or buying,] and I defrauded, or deceived,<br>\
him therein. (K, * TA.) And عارضهُ بِالمَجْدِ [He<br>\
vied, or competed, or contended, with him, or emulated him, or rivalled him, in glory, or honour,<br>\
&amp;c.]: (L and K in art. مجد:) and in like<br>\
manner عارضهُ بِالفَخْرِ. (K in art. فخر.) See 6.<br>\

or on the opposite side to him; (S, A, O, K;) in<br>\
a corresponding manner; (TA;) [each taking<br>\

as signifying It (a tract &amp;c.) lay over against<br>\

[Hence also,] عارض, (S, O, K,) inf. n. مُعَارَضَةٌ,<br>\
(TA,) He took to one side (S, O, K *) of the way,<br>\
or ways, (accord. to different copies of the K,)<br>\

El-Ba&#39;eeth says,<br>\
مَدَحْنَا لَهَا رَوْقَ الشَّبَابِ فَعَارَضَتْ<br>\
جَنَابَ الصِّبَا فِى كَاتِمِ السِّرِّ أَعْجَمَا<br>\
[cited in the S, voce رَيِّق, but with رَيْقَ, in the<br>\
place of رَوْقَ, and there ascribed to Lebeed,]<br>\
meaning, accord. to ISk, [We praised to her the<br>\

(S, O, K;) [not meaning عَنْ عِرَاضٍ, (see 3,) as<br>\
Freytag, deviating from Golius, has understood<br>\

5<br>\
تعرّض: see عَرَضَ, near the beginning, where<br>\
these two verbs, and اعرض and اعترض, are said<br>\
to be used as syn.; [app. as meaning It showed,<br>\
presented, or offered, itself, to a person; lit. it<br>\
showed, or presented, its breadth, or width; or,<br>\
as تعرّض is expl. in the EM p. 19, it showed its<br>\
عُرْض, i. e. side: this, or it, or he, presented, or<br>\
offered, or exposed, its, or his, side, seems to be<br>\
the primary signification of تعرّض, and of اعترض,<br>\
as well as of عَرَضَ; and is of frequent occurrence: and all (as mentioned voce عَرَضَ) signify<br>\
also he obtruded himself in an affair; interfered<br>\
therein.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] تعرّض لَهُ He opposed himself to him; he offered opposition to him; or he<br>\
attacked him; said of a man, and of a beast of<br>\
prey, or noxious reptile, and the like; as also<br>\
↓ عَرَضَ and ↓ اعترض: this signification also is of<br>\
frequent occurrence. (The lexicons passim.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence also,] He addressed, or applied, or directed, himself, or his regard, or attention, or<br>\
mind, to him, or it; [as though he set himself<br>\
over against the object to which the verb relates;]<br>\
syn. تَصَدَّى. (Lth, Lh, S, O, Msb, K.) So in<br>\
the saying, تعرّض لِمَعْرُوفِهِمْ and مَعْرُوفَهُمْ [He<br>\
addressed himself, &amp;c., presented himself, betook<br>\
himself, advanced, came forward, or went forward, or attempted, to obtain their favour, or<br>\
bounty]: and تعرّض لِلْمَعْرُوفِ and المَعْرُوفَ [He<br>\
addressed himself, &amp;c., to obtain favour, or<br>\
bounty; and] he sought, or demanded, it: (Az,<br>\
Msb:) and [so] للمعروف ↓ اعترض (Msb in art.<br>\
عر. [See also اعترض لَهُ.]) So too in the saying,<br>\
تَعَرَّضُوا لِنَفَحَاتِ رَحْمَةِ اللّٰهِ [Address ye yourselves,<br>\
&amp;c., to become objects of the effusions of the mercy<br>\
of God]; (O, K, TA;) occurring in a trad.<br>\
(TA.) And hence the saying, تعرّض فِى شَهَادَتِهِ<br>\
لِكَذَا He addressed himself, &amp;c., (تصدّى,) in his<br>\
testimony, to the mention of such a thing. (Msb.)<br>\
It is likewise syn. with تصدّى in the saying,<br>\
تعرّض لِى فُلَانٌ بِمَكْرُوهٍ [Such a one addressed himself, &amp;c., or attempted, to do me an abominable,<br>\
or evil, action; or opposed himself to me with an<br>\
abominable, or evil, action]. (Lth.) [In like<br>\
manner also you say,] يَتَعَرَّضُ لِلنَّاسِ بِالشَّرِّ [He<br>\
addresses himself, &amp;c., to do to men evil; or he<br>\
opposes himself to men with evil or mischief]. (S,<br>\
K.) And مَا تَعَرَّضْتُ لَهُ بِسُوْءٍ [I did not address<br>\
myself, or have not addressed myself, &amp;c., to do to<br>\
him evil]: and ↓ مَا عَرَضْتُ and ↓ مَا عَرِضْتُ are<br>\
said to signify the same. (Msb.) [See 1.] You<br>\
say also, تَعَرَّضْتُ أَسْأَلُهُمْ [I addressed myself, &amp;c.,<br>\
to ask them]. (S, O. *) And جَآءَ فُلَانٌ يَتَعَرَّضُ,<br>\
and يَتَضَرَّعُ, Such a one came asking, or petitioning, to another, for a thing that he wanted. (Fr,<br>\
in S, art.ضرع.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And تعرّض الرِّفَاقَ He asked the<br>\
companies of travellers for what are termed<br>\
عُرَاضَات [pl. of عُرَاضَةٌ, q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  تعرّض<br>\
لِكَذَا [also signifies He exposed himself, or became<br>\
exposed, to such a thing]. (S.) See 2, latter portion. ―<br>\
-b6-  Also تعرّض, [from عُرْضٌ,] He, or it,<br>\
turned aside; turned from the right course or<br>\
direction; syn. تَعَوَّجَ; (S, K, TA;) and زَاغَ:<br>\
(TA:) his, or its, course, or march, was, or became, indirect, or oblique. (L, TA.) You say,<br>\
تعرّض الجَمَلُ فِى الجَبَلِ The camel went to the<br>\
right and left, [in, or upon, the mountain,] on account of the difficulty of the road, or way. (S,<br>\
O, K.) And تَعَرَّضَتِ الإِبِلُ المَدَارِجَ The camels<br>\
went along the routes (فِى المَدَارِجِ) [المَدَارِجَ being<br>\
in the accus. case because فى is understood, not<br>\
that the verb is trans.] to the right and left;<br>\
(A;) i. e., alternately to the right and left. (T<br>\
in art. ثنى.) [See a verse cited voce تَصَدَّفَ, and<br>\
its explanation.] Dhu-l-Bijádeyn, being guide<br>\
to the Apostle, addressing his she-camel, said,<br>\
تَعَرَّضِى مَدَارِجًا وَسُومِى<br>\
تَعَرُّضَ الجَوْزَآءِ لِلنُّجُومِ<br>\
هٰذَا أَبُو القَاسِمِ فَاسْتَقِيمِى<br>\
(S, O) Go thou along routes to the right and left,<br>\
avoiding the rugged acclivities, [and continue thy<br>\
course, or as expl. in the TA, art. سوم, pass along<br>\
quickly,] (TA,) like as الجوزاء [Orion] passes<br>\
along in the sky obliquely, or indirectly, in the<br>\
disposition of its stars [with respect to the other<br>\
stars: (see 3, towards the end:) this is Abu-l-<br>\
Kásim; therefore go thou right]. (IAth, TA.)<br>\

You say also, of a camel, فِى سَيْرِهِ ↓ يَعْتَرِضُ [He<br>\

-b8-  تعرّض also signifies It (a thing) became infected, vitiated, or corrupted; and in this sense<br>\
it is said of love: (TA:) [as though it turned<br>\

mentioned before; and thus it is expl. in the S,<br>\
as occurring in the phrase تعرّض وَصْلُهُ, in the<br>\
Mo&#39;allakah of Lebeed; or, thus used, it signifies]<br>\
it (a person&#39;s attachment to another) became<br>\

where these two verbs and اعرض and تعرّض, are<br>\
said to be used as syn., app. in the senses expl.<br>\

of these meanings; and in the former sense it is<br>\
used, in the TA, art. حر, in describing the direction of an asterism, opposed to اِنْتَصَبَ: or, in<br>\
other words,] it (a thing, S) became, (K,) or became an obstacle, (صَارَ عَارِضًا, S, O,) like a piece<br>\

extending sideways, or stretching along in the horizon like a mountain; see عَارِضٌ: and] of a building,<br>\
or other thing, such as a trunk of a palm-tree, or<br>\
a mountain, lying in a road: and as this prevents<br>\
the passengers from passing along the road, it is<br>\
used as signifying He, or it, prevented, or hindered: (O, K:) it is quasi-pass. of عَرَضَهُ. (K, *<br>\
TA.) [And hence,] اُعْتُرِضَ عَنِ امْرَأَتِهِ, (O, TA,)<br>\

He was prevented from going in to his wife, by an<br>\
obstacle that befell him, arising from the jinn,<br>\

false, and refusing to obey the truth. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
اعترضهُ He faced him, and advanced towards him:<br>\

of this explanation is a mistranscription, which I<br>\
have rectified in the translation; اخذعا for<br>\

-b2-  [Hence, app.,] اعترض فُلَانٌ الشَّىْءَ<br>\
Such a one undertook the thing, or constrained<br>\
himself to do it, it being difficult, or troublesome,<br>\
or inconvenient. (IAth.)<br>\

TA.) He ate the thorns: and الشَّوْكَ ↓ عَرَضَ, aor.<br>\
عَرُضَ,<br>\

retaliation has been refused, means they accepted<br>\
[قَبِلُوا, for which اقبلوا has been substituted by the<br>\
copyists in the L and TA,] the bloodwit [as a<br>\

استعرض: see عَرُضَ; second sentence. ―<br>\

mutual distance of the edges or sides of a thing:<br>\
(Msb:) primarily relating to corporeal things,<br>\

copies of the K.) You say, رَأَيْتُهُ فِى عُرْضِ النَّاسِ<br>\
I saw him among the people: (S, O:) and some<br>\

him in the midst of the people; (TA;) or, as also<br>\
النَّاسِ ↓ فِى عُرُضِ, in the middle portions of the<br>\
people; or, as some say, in the surrounding portions of the people. (Msb.) And فُلَانٌ مِنْ عُرْضِ<br>\

عِرْضٌ: see عُرْضٌ, first signification. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
The side of a valley, and of a بَلَد [i. e. country or<br>\
the like, or town or the like]: (K: [in the CK,<br>\
بلد is in the nom. case, which I think a mistake:])<br>\
or (as some say, TA) a part, region, quarter, or<br>\

-b4-  أَعْراضُ الحِجَازِ The<br>\

(TA,) or the أَعْرَاض, (S, O,) are certain towns,<br>\

أَعْرَاضُ المَدِينَةِ is applied to the towns, or villages,<br>\
that are in the valleys of El-Medeeneh: (TA:)<br>\

-A4-  One&#39;s self; syn. نَفْسٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;)<br>\

himself; or] free from reproach; (S, O;) or<br>\
from fault, or vice, or the like. (S, Msb.) And<br>\
in the same sense it occurs in the saying of Abu-d-Dardà, أَقْرِضْ مِنْ عِرْضِكَ لِيَوْمِ فَقْرِكَ [Lend thou<br>\
from thyself for the day of thy poverty: but see<br>\
art. قرض]: and in other instances. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
The body; syn. جَسَدٌ, (IAar, S, O, K,) or بَدَنٌ:<br>\
(IKt, Az:) pl. أَعْرَاضٌ. (Az, S.) So in the<br>\
description of the people of Paradise, (Az, S,)<br>\
in a trad., (Az,) إِنَّمَا هُوَ عَرَقٌ يَجْرِى مِنْ أَعْرَاضِهِمْ<br>\
[It is only sweat which flows from their bodies].<br>\
(Az, S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The skin. (Ibráheem El-Harbee,<br>\
O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Any place of the body that sweats:<br>\
(O, K:) so in the trad. cited above: (TA:) or<br>\
any part of the body such as the arm-pit and the<br>\
groin and the like. (A&#39;Obeyd.) ―<br>\
-b5-  The odour of<br>\
the body, (S, O, K,) and of other things, (S, O,)<br>\
whether sweet or foul. (S, O, K.) You say,<br>\
فُلَانٌ طَيِّبُ العِرْضِ [Such a one is sweet in respect<br>\
of odour], and مُنْتِنُ العِرْضِ [foul in respect of<br>\
odour]; and سِقَآءٌ خَبِيثُ العِرْضِ a stinking water-skin, or milk-skin; from A&#39;Obeyd. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
A man&#39;s honour, or reputation, (جَانِبُهُ,) which he<br>\
preserves from impairment and blame, both as it<br>\
relates to himself and to his حَسَب [or grounds of<br>\
pretension to respect on account of the honourable<br>\
deeds or qualities of his ancestors, &amp;c.]: (IAth,<br>\
O, K:) or whether it relate to himself or to his<br>\
ancestors or to those of whose affairs the management is incumbent on him: (K:) or a subject of<br>\
praise, and of blame, of a man, (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás,<br>\
IAth, O, K,) whether it be in himself or in his<br>\
ancestors or in those of whose affairs the management is incumbent on him: (IAth:) or those<br>\
things by the mention whereof with praise or dispraise a man rises or falls; which may be things<br>\
whereby he is characterized exclusively of his<br>\
ancestors; and it may be that his ancestors are<br>\
mentioned in such a manner that imperfection<br>\
shall attach to him by reason of the blaming of<br>\
them. respecting this there is no disagreement<br>\
among the lexicologists, except IKt [whose objection see in what follows]: (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, O:) or<br>\
(accord. to some, S) grounds of pretension to<br>\
respect on account of the honourable deeds or<br>\
qualities of one&#39;s ancestors, &amp;c., (حَسَبٌ, S, Msb,<br>\
K,) and eminence, or nobility, (شَرَفٌ,) in which<br>\
one glories. (K.) You say, فُلَانٌ كَرِيمُ العِرْضِ<br>\
Such a one is generous, or noble, in respect of<br>\
حَسَب: and هُوَ ذُو عِرْضٍ he is a possessor of<br>\
حَسَب; and of شَرَف. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Sometimes,<br>\
Ancestors are meant by it. (A&#39;Obeyd, K.) Thus<br>\
you say, شَتَمَ فُلَانٌ عِرْضَ فُلَانٍ, meaning Such a<br>\
one spoke evil of the ancestors of such a one.<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd.) And فُلَانٌ جَرِبُ العِرْضِ Such a one<br>\
is base, or ignoble, in respect of ancestry. (TA.)<br>\
IKt disallows this signification, asserting عِرْضٌ<br>\
to have no other signification than those of a<br>\
man&#39;s نَفْس and his بَدَن: (O, * TA:) but I Amb<br>\
says that this is an error; as is shown by the<br>\
saying of Aboo-Miskeen Ed-Dárimee,<br>\
رُبَّ مَهْزُولٍ سَمِينٌ عِرْضُهُ<br>\
وَسَمِينِ الجِسْمِ مَهْزُولُ الحَسَبْ<br>\
in which عِرْض cannot be syn. with بَدَن and جِسْم,<br>\
for, were it so, it would involve a contradiction;<br>\
the meaning being only Many a person meagre<br>\
in respect of his body is noble [or great] in respect<br>\
of his ancestry; [and fat in respect of the body,<br>\
meagre in respect of grounds of pretension to<br>\
honour on account of the honourable deeds or<br>\
qualities of his ancestors, &amp;c.:] and by Mohammad&#39;s using the expression دَمُهُ وَعِرْضُهُ; for if<br>\
عِرْض were [here] syn. with نَفْس, it had sufficed<br>\
to say دمه without عرضه. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Also<br>\
A natural disposition that is commended. (IAth,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And A good action. (TA.)<br>\
-A5-  Also One<br>\
who speaks evil of men (يَعْتَرِضُهُمْ) falsely; (O,<br>\
K;) applied to a man: and so with عِرْضَنٌ applied to a<br>\
woman: (O, K: *) so too ↓ ة applied to a<br>\
man, and with عَرْضَنٌ to a woman. (TA.)<br>\
عَرَضٌ A thing that happens to, befalls, or occurs<br>\
to, a man; such as disease, and the like; (S, O,<br>\
K;) as disquietude of mind, and a state of distraction of the mind or attention: or a misfortune,<br>\
such as death, and disease, and the like: (TA:)<br>\
or an event that happens to a man, whereby he is<br>\
tried: (As:) or a thing that happens to a man,<br>\
whereby he is impeded; such as disease, or a theft:<br>\
(Lh:) or a bane, or cause of mischief, that occurs<br>\
in a thing; as also ↓ عَارِضٌ: (TA:) [both signify also an accident of any kind:] pl. أَعْرَاضٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A thing&#39;s befalling, or hitting, unexpectedly. (O, K. [I follow the reading of the<br>\
O, which is that of the K as given in the TA,<br>\
and of my MS. copy of the K, أَنْ يُصِيبَ الشَّىْءُ<br>\
عَلَى غِرَّةٍ; in preference to that in the CK, أَنْ<br>\
تُصِيبَ الشَّىْءَ عَلَى غِرَّةٍ.]) You say, أَصَابَهُ سَهْمُ<br>\
عَرَضٍ (S, A, O, K *) and سَهْمٌ عَرَضٌ, (A, TA,) and<br>\
حَجَرُ عَرَضٍ (S, O) and حَجَرٌ عَرَضٌ, (TA,) [A random arrow, and a random stone, or] an arrow,<br>\
and a stone, aimed at another, hit him: (S, O,<br>\
K:) such as hits, or falls upon, a man without<br>\
any one&#39;s shooting it, or casting it, is not thus<br>\
termed. (L.) And مَا جَآءَكَ مِنَ الرَّأْىِ عَرَضًا خَيْرٌ<br>\
مِمَّا جَآءَكَ مُسْتَكْرَهًا, i. e. [The opinion] that comes<br>\
to thee without consideration, or thought, [is better<br>\
than that which comes to thee forced.] (TA.)<br>\
And عُلِّقْتُهَا عَرَضًا I became attached to her (S, O,<br>\
K) accidentally, or unintentionally, (S, O,) in<br>\
consequence of her presenting herself to me (ISk,<br>\
S, O, K) as a thing occurring without my seeking<br>\
it. (ISk.) [See an ex., in a verse of Antarah,<br>\
cited in the first paragraph of art. زعم; and<br>\
another, in a verse of El-Aashà, cited in the first<br>\
paragraph of art. علق.] ―<br>\
-b3-  A thing that is not<br>\
permanent: (Mgh, O, B, K.) so in the conventional language of the Muslim theologians:<br>\
(Mgh:) opposed to جَوْهَرٌ: (TA:) or hence metaphorically applied by the Muslim theologians<br>\
to (tropical:)  a thing that has not permanence unless in, or<br>\
by, the substance; [i. e., in the language of old logicians, an accident; an essential, and an accidental (as meaning a non-essential), property, or<br>\
quality; or what modern logicians call a mode;<br>\
whether it be, in their language, an essential mode<br>\
or an accidental mode; which latter only they<br>\
term “ an accident; ”] as colour, and taste: (B:)<br>\
or, in the conventional language of the Muslim<br>\
theologians (المُتَكَلِّمُون [expl. in the TA as signifying “ the philosophers,” from whom, however,<br>\
they are generally distinguished]), a thing that<br>\
subsists in, or by, another thing; (O, K;) as<br>\
colours, and tastes, and smells, and sounds, and<br>\
powers, and wills: (O: [and the like is said in<br>\
the Msb:]) or, in philosophy, a thing that exists<br>\
in its subject, or substance, and ceases therefrom<br>\
without the latter&#39;s becoming impaired or annihilated; and also such as does not cease therefrom:<br>\
the former kind being such as tawniness occasioned<br>\
by an altered state of the body, and yellowness of<br>\
complexion, and motion of a thing moving; and<br>\
the latter kind, such as the blackness of pitch, and<br>\
of [the beads called] سَبَج, and of the crow. (L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence, An appertenance of any kind. ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
Hence also,] The frail goods (حُطَام) of the<br>\
present world or state; (As, O, K;) and what a<br>\
man acquires thereof: (As, O:) [so called as<br>\
being not permanent:] or worldly goods or commodities, (AO, Msb,) of whatever kind, are thus<br>\
called, with fet-h to the ر: (AO:) and any property or wealth, little or much, (S, O, K,) is thus<br>\
called, (K,) or is called عَرَضُ الدُّنْيَا. (S, O.)<br>\
See also عَرْضٌ, expl. as signifying “ a commodity,” or “ commodities ” or “ goods. ” One says,<br>\
الدُّنْيَا عَرَضٌ حَاضِرٌ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا البَرُّ وَالفَاجِرُ [The world<br>\
is a present frail good: the righteous and the unrighteous eat thereof]: (S, O, TA:) i. e. it has<br>\
no permanence: a trad. related by Sheddád Ibn-Ows. (TA.) And in another trad. related by<br>\
the same, it is said, لَيْسَ الغِنَى عَنْ كَثْرَةِ العَرَضِ<br>\
إِنَّمَا الغِنَى غِنَى النَّفْسِ [Richness is not from the<br>\
abundance of worldly goods: richness is only richness of the soul]. (O, TA.) One says also, قَدْ<br>\
فَاتَهُ العَرَضُ, (Yoo, S, L,) and ↓ العَرْضُ, but the<br>\
former is the more approved, (L,) [The property,<br>\
&amp;c., (but see another meaning below,) had escaped him], which is from عَرْضُ الجُنْدِ, [see<br>\
عَرَضَ,] like as one says قَبَضَ قَبْضًا and قَدْ أَلْقَاهُ<br>\
فِى القَبَضِ: (Yoo, S:) [which seems to indicate<br>\
that عَرَضٌ properly signifies مَعْرُوضٌ, like as<br>\
قَبَضٌ signifies مَقْبُوضٌ.] ―<br>\
-b6-  Booty; spoil. (O,<br>\
K.) So in the Kur ix. 42: (O:) or it there signifies ―<br>\
-b7-  i. q. مَطْلَبٌ [app. meaning A thing<br>\
sought, or desired; and object of desire; rather<br>\
than a place where a thing is sought]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  I. q. طَمَعٌ [app. meaning A thing that is<br>\
eagerly desired, or coveted: and also eager desire;<br>\
or covetousness]. (AO, O, K.) So explained by<br>\
some as occurring in the saying قَدْ فَاتَهُ العَرَضُ,<br>\
mentioned above. (TA.) And the following<br>\
verse is also cited as an ex.,<br>\
مَنْ كَانَ يَرْجُو بَقَآءً لَا نَفَادَ لَهُ<br>\
فَلَا يَكُنْ عَرَضُ الدُّنْيَا لَهُ شَجَنَا<br>\
[Whoso hopeth for continuance without cessation,<br>\
let not the eager desire of worldly goods be to him<br>\
a cause of anxiety]. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  A gift. (TA.)<br>\
See also عُرَاضَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b10-  هُوَ عَلَى عَرَضِ الوُجُودِ signifies<br>\
عَلَى إِمْكَانِهِ [app. meaning It is in the condition of<br>\
possibility of existence; for على seems to be here<br>\
used in the sense of فِى, as in some other instances]; from أَعْرَضَ لَهُ meaning “ it became within<br>\
his power,” &amp;c. (Mgh.) And one says, هُوَ بِعَرَضٍ<br>\
أَنْ يَضِيعَ [He is exposed, or liable, to perish].<br>\
(Mgh voce ضَيَاعٌ.) ―<br>\
-b11-  جَعَلَ الشَّىْءَ عَرَضًا لِلشَّىْءِ, or<br>\
عَرْضًا, accord. to different copies of the K: see 2,<br>\
in the latter half of the paragraph, in two places.<br>\
عُرُضٌ, (L, TA,) in the K, erroneously, ↓ عُرْضٌ,<br>\
(TA,) A certain manner of going along, (K, TA,)<br>\
towards one side, (TA,) approved in horses, but<br>\
disapproved in camels. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَظَرَ إِلَيْهِ عَنْ<br>\
عُرُضٍ: ―<br>\
-b3-  and رَأَيْتُهُ فِى عُرُضِ النَّاسِ: see عُرْضٌ.<br>\
عُرْضَةٌ is of the measure فُعْلَةٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure مَفْعولٌ, like قُبْضَةٌ; (Bd, ii. 224;) and<br>\
is applied to A thing that is set as an obstacle in<br>\
the way of a thing: (Bd, TA:) and also to a<br>\
thing that is exposed to a thing: (Bd:) or that<br>\
is set as a butt, like the butt of archers. (TA.)<br>\
You say, جَعَلْتُ فُلَانًا عُرْضَةً لِكَذَا, meaning نَصَبْتُهُ<br>\
لَهُ; (S, O, K; *) i. e. I set such a one as an obstacle to such a thing: or as a butt for such a<br>\
thing. (TA.) And هُوَ لَهُ دُونَهُ عُرْضَةٌ He is an<br>\
obstacle to him intervening in the way of it. (S,<br>\
O.) And فُلَانٌ عُرْضَةٌ لِلنَّاسِ Such a one is [a butt<br>\
to men; i. e.] a person whom men cease not to<br>\
revile: (S, O, Msb, K:) or a person to whom<br>\
men address themselves to do evil, and whom they<br>\
revile. (Az, TA.) And هُمْ ضُعَفَآءُ عُرْضَةٌ لِكُلِّ مُتَنَاوِلٍ<br>\
They are weak persons; persons who offer themselves<br>\
as a prey to any one who would take them. (TA.)<br>\
And it is said in the Kur [ii. 224], وَلَا تَجْعَلُوا<br>\
اللّٰهُ عُرْضَةً لِأَيْمَانِكُمْ أَنْ تَبَرُّوا وَتَتَّقُوا وَتُصْلِحُوا بَيْنَ<br>\
النَّاسِ, (S, * &amp;c.,) meaning نَصْبًا; (S, TA;) admitting the two significations of an obstacle and a<br>\
butt: (TA:) i. e. And make not God an obstacle<br>\
between you and that which may bring you near<br>\
unto God, &amp;c.: (O, K:) or make not God an<br>\
obstacle to the performance of your oaths to be<br>\
pious (O, Bd) and to fear God and to make reconciliation between men: or make not God an<br>\
obstacle, because of your oaths, to your being pious<br>\
&amp;c.: (Bd:) or make not the swearing by God an<br>\
obstacle to your being pious [&amp;c.]: (Fr:) and Zj<br>\
says the like of this: (L:) or عُرْضَةٌ signifies intervention with respect to good and evil; (Abu-l-<br>\
&#39;Abbás, O, K;) and the meaning is, do not intervene by swearing by God every little while so as<br>\
not to be pious &amp;c.: (O, K, * TA:) or make not<br>\
God an object of your oaths, by ordinary and<br>\
frequent swearing by Him, (Bd,) or a butt for<br>\
your oaths, like the butt of archers, (TA,) in<br>\
order that ye may be pious &amp;c.; for the habitual<br>\
swearer emboldens himself against God, and is<br>\
not pious &amp;c.: (Bd:) or, as some say, the meaning is make not the mention of God a means of<br>\
strengthening your oaths. (TA.) You say also,<br>\
هٰذَا عُرْضَةٌ لَكَ as meaning This is a thing prepared<br>\
for thy common, or ordinary, use. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
A purpose; an intention; or an object of desire,<br>\
or of endeavour; [as though it were a butt;]<br>\
syn. هِمَّةٌ. (S, O, K.) Hassán says, (S, O,) i. e.<br>\
Ibn-Thábit, (O, TA,)<br>\
وَقَالَ اللّٰهُ قَدْ يَسَّرْتُ جُنْدًا<br>\
هُمُ الأَنْصَارُ عُرْضَتُهَا اللِّقَآءُ<br>\
[And God said I have prepared an army: they<br>\
are the Ansár; whose purpose, or the object of whose<br>\
desire, is conflict with the unbelievers]. (S, O,<br>\
TA. [In one copy of the S, in the place of يَسَّرْتُ,<br>\
I find أَعْدَدْتُ, which signifies the same.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  A<br>\
pretext; an excuse. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  One says also,<br>\
فُلَانٌ عُرْضَةُ ذَاكَ, (S, O,) or عُرْضَةٌ لِذَاكَ, (S, O, K,)<br>\
Such a one is possessed of the requisite ability and<br>\
strength for that: (S, O, K:) and عُرْضَةٌ لِلشَّرِّ possessed of strength to do evil, or mischief: and in<br>\
like manner عُرْضَةٌ is applied to two things, and to<br>\
more. (TA.) And فُلَانَةُ عُرْضَةٌ لِلزَّوْجِ (S, O, K)<br>\
Such a female is possessed of sufficient strength for<br>\
the husband; [i. e., to be married;] (TA;) or<br>\
لِلنِّكَاحِ for marriage. (A.) And نَاقَةٌ عُرْضَةٌ<br>\
لِلْحِجَارَةِ A she-camel having strength enough for<br>\
[going upon] the stones. (S, O, K.) And [in<br>\
like manner] أَسْفَارٍ ↓ نَاقَةٌ عُرْضُ A she-camel having<br>\
strength sufficient for journeys. (S, O, K. *) And<br>\
هٰذَا البَعِيرِ السَّفَرُ وَالحَجَرُ ↓ عُرْضُ (S, O, K) The<br>\
strength of this camel is sufficient for journeying<br>\
and for going over stone. (IB.)<br>\
-A2-  عُرْضَةٌ also<br>\
signifies A kind of trick, or artifice, in wrestling,<br>\
(S, O, K,) by which one throws down men.<br>\
(S, O.)<br>\
عَرْضِىٌّ [in the CK عَرْضٰى] A kind of cloths or<br>\
garments. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Certain of the appertenances (مَرَافِق, O, K) and chambers (O) of<br>\
the house: a word of the dial. of El-&#39;Irák: (O,<br>\
K:) unknown to the Arabs. (O.)<br>\
عُرْضِىٌّ A camel that goes obliquely, or inclining<br>\
towards one side, because not yet completely trained:<br>\
(S, O, K:) or submissive in the middle part [or<br>\
body, so as to be easy to ride, but] difficult of<br>\
management: and perverse, untoward, or intractable: and with ة, a she-camel not completely<br>\
trained: (TA:) or difficult to manage; refractory. (S, O, K.) See also عَرُوضٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  One<br>\
who does not sit steadily, or firmly, upon the<br>\
saddle; (IAar, O, K;) inclining at one time this<br>\
way, and at another time that way. (IAar, O.)<br>\

looked towards such a one from the outer angle<br>\
of my eye. (S, O, K. *) The dim. of ↓ عِرَضْنَى<br>\
is ↓ عُرَيْضِنٌ; the ن being retained because it is a<br>\

-b2-  Also, [app.<br>\
for ذَاتُ عِرَضْنَةٍ,] A she-camel that goes along<br>\
obliquely, (S, O, K,) by reason of briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness: pl. عِرَضْنَاتٌ. (S, O. [See,<br>\

-A6-  عَرُوضُ<br>\
كَلَامٍ The meaning, or intended sense, of speech;<br>\
syn. فَحْوَاهُ, (ISk, S, O, K,) and مَعْنَاهُ: (ISk, S,<br>\
O:) as also كَلَامٍ ↓ مِعْرَاضُ, (K,) of which the<br>\
pl. is مَعَارِيضُ and مَعَارِضُ. (TA.) One says<br>\
عَرَفْتُ ذَٰلِكَ فِى عَرُوضِ كَلَامِهِ [I knew that in<br>\
the intended sense of his speech]; (ISk, S, O;)<br>\
and كَلَامِهِ ↓ فِى مِعْرَاضِ; (A, O;) and in like<br>\

عَرُوضٌ also signifies The transverse pole or piece<br>\
of wood (عَارضَة) which is in the middle of a tent,<br>\

-b2-  And hence, (Aboo-Is-hák,) The middle portion [or foot] of a verse; (Aboo-Is-hák, O;) for<br>\
the بَيْت of poetry is constructed after the manner<br>\
of the بَيْت inhabited by the Arabs, which is of<br>\
pieces of cloth; and as the عروض of the latter is<br>\
the strongest part, so should that of the former<br>\
be; and accordingly we see that a deficiency in<br>\
the ضَرْب is more frequent than it is in the عروض:<br>\
(Aboo-Is-hák:) the last foot of the first half or<br>\
hemistich (S, K) of a verse; (S;) whether perfect<br>\
or altered: (K:) some make it to be the طَرَائِق<br>\

it to these parts of the tents:] it is fem.: (K:)<br>\
or sometimes masc.: (L:) the pl. is أَعَارِيضُ; (S,<br>\

science of the rules whereby the perfect measures of<br>\
Arabic verse are known from those which are<br>\
broken; (Msb;) the standard whereby verse is<br>\
measured: (S, O, K:) because it is compared<br>\
(يُعَارَضُ) therewith: (S, O:) or because what is<br>\
correct in measure is thereby distinguished from<br>\
what is broken: (K: [in which some other reasons<br>\
are added, too futile, in my opinion, to deserve<br>\
mention: I think it more probable that عروض is<br>\
used by a synecdoche for شِعْرٌ, as being the most<br>\
essential part thereof; and then, elliptically, for<br>\
عِلْمُ العَرُوضِ, which is the more common term for<br>\
the science:]) it is fem.; and has no pl., because<br>\
it is a gen. n. (S, O.)<br>\
-A9-  See also عَارِضَةٌ; second<br>\

reason it is slaughtered; (S;) as also ↓ عَارِضٌ:<br>\
(O, K:) and in like manner, a sheep or goat:<br>\
(TA:) pl. عَوَارِضُ. (S.) It is opposed to عَبِيطٌ,<br>\
which is one that is slaughtered without its<br>\
having any malady. (S, O.) One says, بَنُو فُلَانٍ<br>\
لَا يَأْكُلُونَ إِلَّا العَوَارِضَ [The sons of such a one<br>\
do not eat any but camels such as are slaughtered<br>\

holds the عِضَادَتَانِ [or two side-posts], above, of a<br>\
door; corresponding to the أُسْكُفَّة [or threshold];<br>\
(S, L;) the upper piece of wood in which the door<br>\
turns. (O, K. [In some copies of the latter, this<br>\
signification is erroneously given to عَارِضٌ.]) The<br>\
عَارِضَتَانِ of a door are also [said to be] the same as<br>\

-b3-  A [rafter, or]<br>\
single one of the عَوَارِض of a roof: (S, O, K: [but<br>\

roof, which are laid across; one of which is called<br>\
عَارِضَةٌ: and عَارِضٌ [a mistranscription for عَوَارِضُ]<br>\

this is what is meant by its being said, in [some<br>\
copies of] the K, that عَارِضٌ is also syn. with<br>\
عَارِضَةٌ; (TA;) [for in some copies of the K, after<br>\
several explanations of العَارِضُ, we find وَالعَارِضَةُ<br>\
وَالسِّنُّ الَّتِى فِى عُرْضِ الفَمِ; whereas, in other<br>\
copies, the و before السِّنُّ is omitted:] courage;<br>\
or courage and energy: (S, K, TA:) power of<br>\
speech: (S:) perspicuity, or chasteness, of speech;<br>\
and eloquence: (K, TA:) or the former signifies<br>\
intuitive knowledge (بَدِيهَةٌ): or determination, resolution, or decision: (A:) and the trimming of<br>\
speech or language, and the removal of its faults:<br>\

مَعْرِضٌ The place of the appearance, [or occurrence,] and of the showing, or exhibiting, or manifesting, and of the mentioning, and of the intending, or purposing, of a thing. (Msb.) You say,<br>\
قَتَلْتُهُ فِى مَعْرِضِ كَذَا I slew him in the place of<br>\
the appearance [or occurrence &amp;c.] of such a thing.<br>\
(Msb.) And ذِكْرُ اللّٰهِ إِنَّمَا يَكُونُ فِى مَعْرِضِ التَّعْظِيمِ<br>\
The praise and glorification of God is only in the<br>\
place [or case] of the appearance, [or of the manifesting,] and of the intending, or purposing, of<br>\
magnifying. (Msb.) [And hence, فِى مَعْرِضِ كَذَا<br>\
also signifies In the time, or case, or on the occasion, of the appearance, &amp;c., of such a thing. And<br>\
In the state, or condition, or manner, which is<br>\
indicative of such a thing: thus virtually agreeing<br>\
with the phrase فِى مِعْرَضِ كَذَا, q. v. infrà.] ―<br>\

(MA.)<br>\
-A2-  And Pasturage that renders the cattle<br>\

مُعْرِضٌ Anything showing its breadth, or width;<br>\
[or its side; as also ↓ عَارِضٌ.] (TA. See the<br>\
latter word.) [And hence, Appearing, as also<br>\
the latter.] And i. q. مُعْتَرِضٌ [app. as signifying<br>\
Presenting itself; or occurring]. (Sh.) And<br>\
Anything putting its breadth, or width, [or side,<br>\
(as is shown by an explanation of أَعْرَضَ,)] in<br>\
one&#39;s power. (TA.) You say, الشَّىْءُ مُعْرِضٌ لَكَ,<br>\
meaning The thing is in thy power; apparent to<br>\
thee; not offering resistance to thee. (IAth, O. *)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And طَأْ مُعْرِضًا حَيْثُ شِئْتَ [Tread thou or]<br>\
put thy feet where thou wilt, fearing nothing, for<br>\

-b3-  اِدَّانَ مُعْرِضًا<br>\
(occurring in a saying of &#39;Omar, K, or, as some<br>\
relate it, دَانَ مُعْرِضًا, K in art. دين,) means He<br>\
bought upon credit, or borrowed, or sought or<br>\
demanded a loan, [doing so (TA)] of whomsoever<br>\
he could, (AZ, S, A, Mgh, O,) not caring what<br>\
might be the consequence: (S, O:) or addressing<br>\

not buy on credit, or borrow: (IAth:) or avoiding payment: (TA:) or from any quarter that<br>\
was easy and practicable to him, without caring,<br>\
(O, K,) and without being perplexed: (O:) or<br>\
he incurred the debt without caring for not paying<br>\
it, or for what might be the consequence: (As:)<br>\
or he contracted a debt with every one who presented himself to him: (K in art. دين:) Sh says<br>\
that the making معرضا to signify مُمْكِنًا is improbable; because it is in the accus. case as a denotative of state with respect to [the agent implied<br>\
in the verb] ادّان; and if you explain it as meaning he took it from him who enabled him, then<br>\
معرضا applies to him whom he accosts, for he is<br>\
the ممكن; [he suggests also, that the meaning<br>\
may be he bought upon credit, or borrowed,<br>\
largely; for] he adds that معرضا may be from<br>\
أَعْرَضَ ثَوْبُ المَلْبَسِ, signifying اِتَّسَعَ and عَرُضَ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\

cooked: (ISk, S, O, K:) occurring in a verse<br>\
(S, O) of Es-Suleyk Ibn-Es-Sulakeh, (O,) as<br>\

ص; (S, O;) and this latter is the more correct.<br>\
(O.)<br>\
-A3-  مُعَرَّضَةٌ A virgin before she is veiled, or<br>\

مُعَرِّضٌ [act. part. n. of 2, q. v.]. A poet describes a she-camel carrying dates, and having<br>\
outgone the other camels, so that the crows, or<br>\
ravens, alighted upon her, and ate the dates, as<br>\
being مِنْ مُعَرِّضَاتِ الغِرْبَانِ, as though she were<br>\
of those feeding the crows, or ravens, of what is<br>\
termed عُرَاضَة, q. v. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  Also the circumciser<br>\
of a boy: (K:) [or] so ↓ مُعْرِضٌ. (O:)<br>\

Mgh, O, Msb, K) nor head, (As,) slender at the<br>\
two extremities, and thick in the middle, (O, K,)<br>\
being in form like the wooden implement wherewith<br>\
cotton is separated from its seeds, or is separated<br>\
and loosened [by striking therewith the string of a<br>\
bow], (O, TA,) which goes sideways, (Mgh, [in<br>\
the O and TA, مُسْتَوِيًا, app. a mistranscription,<br>\
for مُسْتَعْرِضًا,]) striking with its عَرْض [or middle<br>\
part, unless this be a mistake for عُرْض, or side],<br>\
(Mgh, [in my copy of which, عرض is without<br>\
any vowel-sign,] and K,) not with its extremity:<br>\
(Mgh, K:) sometimes, it strikes with its thick<br>\
middle part in such a manner that it breaks and<br>\
crushes what it strikes so that it is like the thing<br>\
that is beaten to death; and if the object of<br>\
the chase be near to it, it strikes it with the<br>\
place of the head thereof: if it make a hole,<br>\
the game smitten with it may be eaten; but not<br>\
if it strike with a middle part (بِعَرْضٍ). (O,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  An oblique, indirect, obscure, ambiguous,<br>\
or equivocal, mode of speech; as when thou askest<br>\
a man, “Hast thou seen such a one? ” and he,<br>\
having seen him, and disliking to lie, answers,<br>\
“ Verily such a one is seen: ” (Msb:) from عَرَّضَ<br>\
[q. v.]: (Msb, El-Munáwee: the latter in explaining a trad., q. v. infrà:) i. q. تَوْرِيَةٌ [signifying as<br>\
above; or the pretending one thing and meaning<br>\
another; or the using a word, an expression, or<br>\
a phrase, which has an obvious meaning, and intending thereby another meaning to which it applies<br>\
but which is contrary to the obvious one]; the<br>\
original meaning of which is concealment: (Msb:)<br>\
or language whereof one part resembles another in<br>\
the meanings: (O, TA: [in the TA immediately<br>\
follows the exemplification cited above, from the<br>\
Msb; whence it seems that this explanation is<br>\
itself somewhat of a معراض, meaning what it<br>\
does not clearly express:]) or المَعَارِيضُ فِى الكَلَامِ<br>\
[thus, with the pl. form, in two copies of the S,<br>\
and in the TA,] signifies التَّوْرِيَةُ بِالشَّىْءِ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ<br>\
[the pretending, or making believe, a thing instead<br>\
of another thing]: (S:) and مَعَارِضُ الكَلَامِ and<br>\
↓ أَعْرَاضُهُ signify the same as مَعَارِيضُهُ. (TA.)<br>\
[مَعَارِضُ is a contraction of مَعَارِيضُ, like as مِعْرضٌ<br>\
is said to be of مِعْرَاضٌ when syn. therewith.] It<br>\
is said in a prov., (S,) a trad., (TA,) إِنَّ فِى<br>\
المَعَارِيضِ لَمَنْدُوحَةً عَنِ الكَذِبِ [Verily, in oblique,<br>\
indirect, obscure, ambiguous, or equivocal, modes<br>\
of speech is ample scope, freedom, or liberty,<br>\
(سَعَةٌ, S,) to avoid lying; or, as is said in the L<br>\
in art. ندح, that which renders one in no need of<br>\
lying]. (S, Msb.) One says also, عَرَفْتُهُ فِى<br>\
مِعْرَاضِ كَلَامِهِ, expl. voce عَرُوضٌ which see in<br>\
three places, and كَلَامِهِ ↓ فِى مِعْرَضِ, rejecting<br>\
the ا: this latter is said by some of the learned to be<br>\
a metaphorical expression, from مِعْرَضٌ signifying<br>\
the “ garment in which girls are displayed,” as<br>\
though the meaning were (tropical:)  [I knew it] in the<br>\
form, or manner, and guise, and mould, of his<br>\
speech; but this does not obtain in all kinds of<br>\
speech; for it may not be said in cases of reviling;<br>\
indeed it would be bad, in these cases, to use as<br>\
a metaphor the garment of adornment: therefore<br>\
the proper way is to say that مِعْرَضٌ is a contraction of مِعْرَاضٌ. (Msb.) One also says الأَلْفَاظُ<br>\
مَعَارِيضُ المَعَانِى (tropical:)  [Words are the robes of meanings]: and this phrase also is [said to be] taken<br>\
from مِعْرَضٌ signifying the “ garment in which a<br>\
girl is displayed; ” because words adorn meanings. (TA.)<br>\
مُعَارِضٌ A camel that does not go straightly in<br>\
the file, or series, but takes to the right and left:<br>\
(A:) or a she camel such as is termed عَلُوق;<br>\

smelling her young one], (تَرْأَمُ بِأَنْفِهَا,) and refuses<br>\
to yield her milk. (AA, O, K.)<br>\

once unless it quit it quickly as it seized it quickly.<br>\
