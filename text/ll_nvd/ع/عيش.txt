meaning, Thou act at one time in an easy state of<br>\
life, and at one time in the state of life of warriors:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, as cited in the TA: [but for عَيْشِ غَزِىّ<br>\
in my original, we should perhaps read عَيْشٍ عَزِيزٍ,<br>\
i. e. a difficult state of life:) or thou benefitest at<br>\
one time, and injurest at another (TA. And a<br>\
man to whom IAar said “ How is such a one &#39;”<br>\

مَعَاشٌ and ↓ مَعِيشٌ may be used as substantives<br>\

TA;) and signify, like مَعِيشَةٌ, That whereby one<br>\
lives: or that [place and time] in which one lives:<br>\
(TA:) [or rather, they have both these significations; but معاش has generally the latter. whereas<br>\
معيشة, q. v., and معيش, are generally used in the<br>\
former sense, or one similar to it:] مَعَاشٌ also<br>\
signifies the place of subsistence; or the known,<br>\
or usual, place thereof: and the time wherein one<br>\
seeks sustenance. (TA.) Thus, (TA,) الأَرْضُ<br>\
مَعَاشُ الخَلْقِ [The earth is the place of subsistence<br>\
of mankind, or of the created beings]. (A, O, TA.)<br>\
And النَّهَارُ مَعَاشٌ The day is the time for seeking<br>\
sustenance: as in the Kur, lxxviii. 11. (O, TA.)<br>\
See also مَعِيشَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
مَعِيشٌ: see مَعِيشَةٌ, in four places: and مَعَاشٌ.<br>\
مَعِيشَةٌ inf. n. of عَاشَ [q. v.]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
Victuals, living, sustenance, or food and drink by<br>\
which one lives; (Lth, A, O, K;) as also ↓ عَيْشٌ;<br>\
(A;) whence you say that dates are the عَيْش of<br>\
such a family: (TA:) that whereby life subsists;<br>\
the means of life or subsistence; (A, K;) as also<br>\
↓ عَيْشٌ: (A, TA:) that whereby one lives; as<br>\
also ↓ عَيْشٌ (A, K, TA) and ↓ مَعَاشٌ and ↓ مَعِيشٌ;<br>\
(TA;) or [the state] wherein one lives; (A, K,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ عَيْشٌ (A) and ↓ مَعَاشٌ and ↓ مَعِيشٌ:<br>\
(TA:) the means of obtaining that whereby one<br>\
lives: (Aboo-Is-hák, TA:) the gain, or earnings,<br>\
by means of which a man lives; (Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
as also ↓ مَعِيشٌ: (Msb:) the pl. is مَعَايِشُ, (S,<br>\
O, Msb,) accord. to general opinion, (Msb,) without ء, (S, O, Msb,) when formed from the original<br>\
of the sing., which is مَعْيِشَةٌ, of the measure<br>\
مَفْعِلَةٌ; (S, O;) or because it is from عَاشَ, so<br>\
that the measure of the pl. is مَفَاعِلُ: (Msb:)<br>\
but when it is formed from the secondary form of<br>\
the sing., it is with ء, [مَعَائِشُ,] مَفْعِلَةٌ being in<br>\
this case likened to فَعِيلَةٌ, like as مَصَائِبُ is with ء<br>\
because the ى [in its sing.] is quiescent; but<br>\
some of the grammarians hold this latter pl. to be<br>\
incorrect: (S, O:) all the Basree grammarians<br>\
hold it to be so: (TA:) or, accord. to some,<br>\
↓ مَعِيشٌ and مَعِيشَةٌ are from معش; and the pl.<br>\
in question is therefore of the measure فَعَائِلُ,<br>\
with ء. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  مَعِيشَةٌ ضَنْكٌ The punishment<br>\
of the grave: (O, K:) so, accord. to most of the<br>\
expositors, in the Kur xx. 123: or, as some say,<br>\
[strait sustenance] in the fire of hell. (O, TA.)<br>\
مُتَعَيِّشٌ One who constrains himself to obtain the<br>\
means of life: (TA:) or who has what is barely<br>\
sufficient, of sustenance, nothing remaining over<br>\
and above it. (Lth, A, O, K.)<br>\
