عَاضَهُ, (S, A, O, Msb, K,) first pers. عُضْتُهُ,<br>\
(A and TA in art. عرض,) aor. يَعُوضُ, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. عَوْضٌ (A, O, Msb, K) and عِوَضٌ (O, K)<br>\
and عِيَاضٌ, (A, O, K,) originally عِوَاضٌ, (O, K,)<br>\
He (God, A, O, K, or a man, S, O, Msb) gave<br>\
him a substitute, or something instead or in exchange, or a compensation, (S, A, * O, Msb, K, *)<br>\
عَنْ كَذَا [for such a thing], (Msb,) or مِنْهُ [for<br>\
it]; (O, K;) or عَاضَهُ مَا أُخِذَ مِنْهُ, said of God,<br>\
[and of a man,] He gave him a substitute for, or<br>\
replaced to him, what had been taken from him;<br>\
(A;) and ↓ عوّضهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَعْوِيضٌ,<br>\
(TA,) signifies the same; (S, A, Msb, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ اعاضهُ; (S, IJ, Msb;) and ↓ عاوضهُ, (S, O,<br>\
K,) inf. n. مُعَاوَضَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عُضْتُهُ I gave to<br>\
him. (IJ.)<br>\
-A2-  عِضْتُ, [originally عَوِضْتُ,] aor.<br>\
أَعَاضُ: see 8.<br>\
2<br>\
عَوَّضَand 3 and 4: see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
5<br>\
تَعَوَّضَ see 8, in two places.<br>\
6<br>\
تعاوض القَوْمُ, inf. n. تَعَاوَضٌ, The people, or<br>\
company of men, had their property and their<br>\
former state restored to them after want. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اعتاض He took, or received, a substitute, or<br>\
something instead or in exchange, or a compensation; (S, Msb;) as also ↓ تعوّض: (S, O, Msb, K:)<br>\
[both of which also signify he had a thing replaced to him:] and ↓ عِضْتُ, [originally عَوِضْتُ,]<br>\
(Lth and TA, in this art. and in art. عرض,) aor.<br>\
أَعَاضُ, (TA in art. عرض,) likewise signifies I<br>\
took, or received, a substitute, or something instead<br>\
or in exchange, or a compensation: (Lth, TA:)<br>\
but Az says, “I have not heard this on any other<br>\
authority than that of Lth. ” (O, TA.) You say<br>\
also, اِعْتَاضَ خَيْرًا مِمَّا ذَهَبَ مِنْهُ [He received as a<br>\
substitute, or compensation, what was better than<br>\
that which had gone from him]; and [in like<br>\
manner] ↓ تَعَوَّضَ. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  اعتاضهُ He came to<br>\
him seeking, or demanding, a substitute, or something instead or in exchange, or a compensation;<br>\
(O, K;) and a free gift, or gratuity. (O, TA.)<br>\
[See also 10.]<br>\
10<br>\
استعاض He sought, or demanded, or asked<br>\
for, a substitute, or something instead or in exchange, or a compensation. (S, O, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It<br>\
is also trans.: you say, استعاضهُ He asked him<br>\
for a substitute, or something instead or in exchange, or a compensation. (A, * O, K.) [See<br>\
also 8, last signification.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [استعاضهُ also signifies He asked, or desired, that it should be replaced to him.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And اِسْتَعْوَضَهُ He took it (a<br>\
thing) as a substitute, or in exchange, for another<br>\
thing; or in the place of another thing; syn.<br>\
اِسْتَخْلَفَهُ [q. v.]. (TA in art. خلف.)<br>\
عَوْضُ and عَوْضَ (Az, S, O, Mughnee, K) and<br>\
عَوْضِ; (Mughnee, K,) the first accord. to Ks<br>\
(TA) and the Koofees, and the second accord. to<br>\
the Basrees; (O, TA; [in which latter it is added<br>\
that the second is the most common; but this I<br>\
think a mistake; for I have most frequently<br>\
found the first; and in the Mughnee, عَوْضُ is<br>\
mentioned first, as in the S and K, and عَوْضَ<br>\
last;]) indecl., (Mughnee, K,) like قَبْلُ and أَيْنَ<br>\
and أَمْسِ, (Mughnee,) without tenween; (S;)<br>\
[but not always, as will be seen below;] an<br>\
adv. n., (Mughnee, K,) denoting future time, (S,<br>\
O,) or all future time, (Mughnee, K,) like as قَطُّ<br>\
denotes past time; (S, O;) meaning Ever; syn.<br>\
أَبَدًا; (S, * O, K;) but differing from أبَدًا by being<br>\
appropriated to negative phrases only: (Mughnee, K: *) you say لَا أُفِارِقُكَ عَوْضُ, (K,) or عَوْضُ<br>\
لَا أُفَارِقُكَ, meaning I will not separate myself from<br>\
thee, ever; like as you say قَطُّ مَا فَارَقْتُكَ; but you<br>\
may not say عَوْضُ مَا فَارَقْتُكَ, like as you may not<br>\
say قَطُّ مَا أُفَارِقُكَ: (S, O:) or it denotes past time<br>\
also, having the same meaning: for you say, مَا<br>\
رَأَيْتُ مِثْلَهُ عَوْضُ, (AZ, K,) meaning I have not<br>\
seen the like of him, or it, ever: (AZ:) so in the<br>\
two books [the O and the TS] of Sgh: and in<br>\
like manner a poet says,<br>\
فَلَمْ أَرَ عَامًا عَوْضُ أَكْثَرَ هَالِكًا<br>\
[And I have not seen a year, ever, more destructive]. (TA.) But it is decl. when prefixed to<br>\
another noun; as in the saying, لَا أفْعَلُهُ عَوْضَ<br>\
↓ العَائِضِينَ (Mughnee, K) I will not do it, ever;<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ لَا آتِيكَ عَوْضَ العَائِضِينَ [I will not<br>\
come to thee, ever]; like as one says, دَهْرَ الدَّاهِرِينَ:<br>\
(S, O:) [for in this case you may not say عَوْضُ.]<br>\
And one also says افعل ذَاكَ مِنْ ذِى عَوْضٍ, [in<br>\
which the first word is written in some copies of<br>\
the S and K اِفْعَلْ, and in others أَفْعَلُ,] like as<br>\
one says, مِنْ ذِى أُنُفٍ, (S, O, K,) and مِنْ ذِى<br>\
قَبَلٍ, (S, O,) meaning [Do thou, or I will do,<br>\
that] in what is [now] to be begun [of time;<br>\
meaning, immediately: see أُنُفٌ]: (S, O, K:)<br>\
[thus making عوض decl., and using it without<br>\
a negative, which must always accompany it<br>\
when it is indecl.] [See also عِوَضٌ.] Or عَوْضُ<br>\
signifies Time; syn. الدَّهْرُ (K) and الزَّمَانُ; (TA;)<br>\
which is thus called because, as often as a portion thereof passes, it substitutes for it another<br>\
portion: (Mughnee, K:) or, as some say, because<br>\
they assert that it despoils and gives compensation. (Mughnee.) [See an ex. in the Ham p. 271,<br>\
where it occurs in this sense with tenween, in the<br>\
printed text, though said in the commentary to be<br>\
indecl., with fet-h or with damm.] Or it is an<br>\
oath; (Ibn-El-Kelbee, Mughnee, K,) and is (so<br>\
in the O and Mughnee, but in the K “ or ”) the<br>\
name of A certain idol, belonging to Bekr Ibn-Wáïl: (S, Mughnee, O, K:) as in a verse cited<br>\
in art. مور: (O, Mughnee:) but if so, there is no<br>\
reason for its being used indeclinably in a verse of<br>\
El-Aashà cited voce أَسْحَمُ [q. v.]: (Mughnee:)<br>\
or it is a word used in the manner of an oath; a<br>\
man saying to his companion, عَوْضُ لَا يَكُونُ ذٰلِكَ<br>\
أَبَدًا [as though meaning Nay, that will not, or<br>\
shall not, be, ever]: for if it were a noun signifying time, it would be with tenween; but it is a<br>\
particle by which is meant an oath, like أَجَلْ and<br>\
نَعَمْ. (Lth, O.)<br>\
عِوَضٌ A substitute; a thing given, or received,<br>\
or put, or done, instead of, in place of, in lieu of,<br>\
or in exchange for, another thing; a compensation; a thing given, or received, by way of replacement; (O;) syn. بَدَلٌ; (M, Msb;) or خَلَفٌ:<br>\
(A, K:) pl. أَعْوَاضٌ. (S, Msb.) See also مَعُوضَةٌ.<br>\
[Hence, عِوَضًا عَنْهُ As a substitute for it; instead<br>\
of, in the place of, or in exchange for, it; as a<br>\
compensation for it; &amp;c.]<br>\
-A2-  مِنْ ذِى عِوَضٍ i. q.<br>\
من ذى عَوْضٍ. (TA in art. قبل.)<br>\
العُوَيْضَان, in the dim. form, [but whether in<br>\
the sing. or dual form is not shown,] The penis<br>\
of a man: of the dial. of El-Yemen. (TA.)<br>\
عَائِضٌ in the saying of Aboo-Mohammad ElFak&#39;asee, (K,) i. e. (TA) in the following saying,<br>\
هَلْ لَكِ وَالعَارِضُ مِنْكِ عَائِضُ<br>\
فِى هَجْمَةٍ يُغْدِرُ مِنْهَا القَابِضُ<br>\
(S, O, TA, in this art. and in art. عرض,) is of the<br>\
measure فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ,<br>\
like [the epithet in the phrase] عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ, (S,<br>\
O, K,) meaning مَرْضِيَّةٌ: (S, O:) As says that<br>\
the poet is addressing a woman whom he is desirous of marrying, saying, Art thou in want,<br>\
(and the gift appearing from thee shall have an<br>\
exchange made for it to thee by me) of a hundred<br>\
camels which I will assign to thee as a dowry,<br>\
some whereof the [quick] driver will abandon, not<br>\
being able to collect them together because of<br>\
their large number? (S in art. عرض: [and the<br>\
like is said in the O, as on the authority of Lth:<br>\
but I have made a transposition in the explanation, directed in the TA, to make it agree with<br>\
the order of the words of the verse:]) or the<br>\
meaning is, and the giver of a thing in exchange<br>\
for the enjoyment of thee receiveth an exchange<br>\
from thee by marriage which is equal to that<br>\
which he giveth in exchange for thee; عائض<br>\
being from عِضْتُ, not from عُضْتُ: [so that, accord. to this explanation, it is used in the sense<br>\
of its own proper measure, فَاعِلٌ:] but IB says<br>\
that the phrase, in his poetry, is وَالعائِضُ مِنْكِ<br>\
عَائِضُ, meaning the thing given in exchange by<br>\
thee will be [indeed] a substitute, or a compensation; like as you say الهِبَةُ مِنْكَ هِبَةٌ: (TA in art.<br>\
عرض:) the verse is also related differently, with<br>\
مِائَةٍ in the place of هَجْمَةٍ, and يُسْئِرُ in the place<br>\
of يُغْدِرُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also عَوْضُ, in two places.<br>\
مَعُوضَةٌ, (S, O, K,) like مَعُونَةٌ, (O, TA,) a<br>\
subst. from عَاضَهُ; (S, O, K;) [i. e. as expl. in<br>\
the TK, meaning خَلَفٌ and بَدَلٌ;] as also<br>\
↓ عِوَضٌ. (O, K.)<br>\
