عَدَاهُ, (Mgh, K,) first pers. عَدَوْتُهُ, (Msb,)<br>\
aor. يَعْدُو, (Mgh, Msb,) [inf. n. عَدْوٌ,] He passed<br>\
from it, (Mgh, Msb, K,) namely, a thing, or an<br>\
affair, (K,) to another, (Mgh, Msb,) and left<br>\
it; (K;) and عَدَا عَنْهُ signifies the same; (K;)<br>\
as also ↓ تعدّاه; (S, * K;) and in like manner<br>\
one says, ↓ عَدَّيْتُهُ, inf. n. تَعْدِيَةٌ; (Msb;) [but I<br>\
do not find this elsewhere, and think that correctly one should say, عَنْهُ ↓ عَدَّيْتُ; agreeably<br>\
with what here follows:] the saying عَنْ هٰذَا ↓ عَدِّ<br>\
means Leave thou this, and turn from it to<br>\
another; and is app. from the phrase هَمَّكَ ↓ عَدِّ<br>\
إِلَى غَيْرِهِ [Turn thy anxiety to other than him,<br>\
or it]; the objective complement being altogether<br>\
left out, so that the verb becomes as though it<br>\
were intrans.; and there are many instances<br>\
similar to this in the language: (Har p. 478:)<br>\
one says, عَنِّى الهَمَّ ↓ عَدَّيْتُ I turned away from<br>\
me anxiety: and [hence] you say to him who<br>\
has pursued you, عَنِّى إِلَى غَيْرِى ↓ عَدِّ, meaning<br>\
Turn thou the beast upon which thou art riding<br>\
towards other than me: (TA:) and عَمَّا تَرَى ↓ عَدِّ,<br>\
meaning Turn thou thine eye from what thou<br>\
seest. (S.) [See an ex. of the first of these verbs<br>\
in the Ham p. 125.] One says also, عَدَاهُ الأَمْرُ<br>\
and ↓ تعدّاهُ The thing, or affair, passed from<br>\
him. (TA. [See an ex. in the first paragraph<br>\
of art. عدم.]) And the Arabs say, إِنَّ الجَرَبَ<br>\
لَيَعْدُو, meaning Verily the mange, or scab, passes<br>\
from him that has it to him that is near to him<br>\
so that the latter becomes mangy, or scabby.<br>\
(Msb.) And مَا عَدَا فُلَانٌ أَنْ صَنَعَ [app. meaning<br>\
Such a one did not leave, or, accord. to an explanation of the verb in a similar phrase in Har<br>\
p. 333, did not delay, his doing such a thing].<br>\
(S.) Accord. to Er-Rághib, العَدْوُ primarily<br>\
signifies Transition; [whence what here precedes;] or the going, or passing, beyond, or the<br>\
exceeding, a limit, or the usual limit: and incompatibility to coalesce. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,]<br>\
عَدَاهُ, aor. as above, [inf. n. عَدْوٌ,] He went, or<br>\
passed, beyond it; exceeded it; or transgressed<br>\
it. (S, TA. *) So in the saying عَدَا طَوْرَهُ [He<br>\
went, or passed, beyond his proper limit; exceeded<br>\
it; or transgressed it]: and in like manner,<br>\
الحَقَّ ↓ تعدّى and ↓ اعتداهُ signify He went, or<br>\
passed, beyond, &amp;c., what was true, or right;<br>\
and so عَنِ الحَقِّ, and فَوْقَ الحَقِّ. (TA.) أَمَا<br>\
عَدَا مَنْ بَدَا, a saying in which the vulgar erroneously omit the interrogative أ, means Does not<br>\
he transgress that which is right who begins by<br>\
acting injuriously? (TA.) And it is said عَدَا<br>\
القَارِصُ فَحَرَزَ (tropical:)  What was biting to the tongue<br>\
attained to an excessive degree, so that it became<br>\
acid: meaning that the affair, or case, became<br>\
distressing. (S in art. قرص.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَدَا عَلَيْهِ,<br>\
inf. n. عَدْوٌ and عَدَآءٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and عُدُوٌّ<br>\
(S, Msb, K) and عُدْوَانٌ (ISd, Msb, K) and<br>\
عِدْوَانٌ (ISd, K) and عُدْوَى; (K;) and ↓ تعدّى,<br>\
and ↓ اعتدى; (S, Msb, K;) He acted wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically, against<br>\
him; (S, Msb, K;) and transgressed against<br>\
him, or exceeded the proper limit against him:<br>\
(S, Msb:) [and he acted aggressively against<br>\
him; agreeably with an explanation of the inf. n.<br>\
of the last of these verbs in what follows: (see<br>\
an ex. in a verse cited voce رِيحٌ:)] or he acted<br>\
with excessive wrongfulness, &amp;c., against him:<br>\
(Mgh:) and ↓ اعدى signifies the same as<br>\
the other verbs here mentioned; (K, TA;)<br>\
whence (TA) one says, فِى مَنْطِقِكَ ↓ أَعْدَيْتَ<br>\
Thou hast deviated from that which is right in<br>\
thy speech: (S, TA:) ↓ الاِعْتِدَآءُ is the exceeding<br>\
what is right; and it is sometimes in the way of<br>\
aggression; and sometimes in the way of requital;<br>\
and instances of the usage of its verb in both of<br>\
these manners occur in the Kur ii. 190: (Er-Rághib, TA:) the first and third of the inf. ns.<br>\
of عَدَا, mentioned above, occur in the Kur vi.<br>\
108 accord. to different readings: (S, TA:) and<br>\
[it is said that] العُدْوَانُ signifies sheer, or unmixed, wrongful or unjust or injurious or tyrannical conduct: (S:) or, as some say, the worst of<br>\
[such conduct, i. e., of] الاِعْتِدَآء, in strength, or<br>\
deed, or state or condition. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَدَا<br>\
عَلَيْهِ He acted corruptly towards him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And عُدِىَ عَلَيْهِ He had his property stolen, and<br>\
was wronged. (TA.) And عَدَا عَلَى القُمَاشِ,<br>\
inf. n. عَدَآءٌ [said in the TA to be like سَحَابٌ,<br>\
but in the CK عَدًا,] and عُدْوَانٌ and عَدَوَانٌ, (K,<br>\
TA,) but in the M written with damm and fet-h<br>\
[i. e. عُدْوَان and عَدْوَان], (TA,) said of a thief,<br>\
He stole the قماش [meaning goods, or utensils<br>\
and furniture]. (K, TA.) And عَدَا فِى ظَهْرِهِ<br>\
He stole what was behind him: (A in art. ظهر:)<br>\
[or he acted wrongfully in respect of what was<br>\
behind him: for] لِصٌّ عَادِى ظَهْرٍ is expl. by the<br>\
words عَدَا فِى ظَهْرٍ فَسَرَقَهُ [so that it app. means<br>\
A thief who has acted wrongfully in respect of<br>\
what was behind one, and stolen it]. (O and K<br>\
in that art.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And عَدَا عَلَيْهِ, (K, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
عَدْوٌ, (TA,) signifies also He leaped upon him,<br>\
or it. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And عَدَا, (K,) or عَدَا فِى<br>\
مَشْيِهِ, (Msb,) aor. يَعْدُو, (Msb, K,) inf. n. عَدْوٌ<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K) and عَدًا and عُدُوٌّ and عَدَوَانٌ<br>\
and تَعْدَآءٌ, (K,) signifies أَحْضَرَ [i. e. He ran; or<br>\
rose in his running]; (S, * K, TA;) said of a man<br>\
and of a horse: (TA:) or he went a pace nearly<br>\
the same as that termed هَرْوَلَةٌ, (Msb, TA,) not so<br>\
quick, (TA,) or which is not so quick, (Msb,) as<br>\
that termed جَرْىٌ: (Msb, TA:) or he went a<br>\
pace less quick than شَدٌّ and more so than مَشْىٌ:<br>\
(TA in art. سعى:) or [he went quickly, or<br>\
swiftly; for] العَدْوُ signifies السُّرْعَةُ: (Mgh:) [or<br>\
rather he ran, whether gently or moderately or<br>\
vehemently: that it often signifies he ran vehemently is shown by the prov. مِنْ سُلَيْكٍ ↓ أَعْدَى<br>\
More vehement in running than Suleyk, who is<br>\
said to have outstripped fleet horses; and by<br>\
numerous exs.:] and ↓ عّى signifies the same<br>\
as عَدَا, denoting a quick pace. (TA in art.<br>\
هبص.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And [hence, perhaps,] عَدَا المَآءُ, aor.<br>\
يَعْدُو, (assumed tropical:)  The water ran. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَدَاهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ,<br>\
(S, K,) inf. n. عَدْوٌ and عُدْوَانٌ; as also ↓ عدّاهُ;<br>\
(K;) signifies He, or it, diverted him; or turned<br>\
him away, or back; (S, K;) and occupied him so<br>\
as to divert him; (K;) from the thing, or affair.<br>\
(S, K.) You say, عَدَتْ عَوَادٍ. (S, TA. See<br>\
عَادِيَةٌ, voce عُدَوَآءُ: and see also the last sentence<br>\
of the first paragraph of art. عود.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَدَانِى مِنْهُ<br>\
شَرٌّ means بَلَغَنِى [i. e., app., Evil, or mischief,<br>\
reached me from him, or it]. (TA. [See a signi-<br>\
fication of 4.])<br>\
-A3-  عَدِيتُ لَهُ signifies I hated him,<br>\
or it. (ISd, K.)<br>\
-A4-  عَدَا is also a verb by which<br>\
one makes an exception, with مَا [preceding<br>\
it] and without مَا: (S, K:) you say, جَآءَنِى<br>\
القَوْمُ مَا عَدَا زَيْدًا [The people, or party, came to<br>\
me, except Zeyd]; and جَاؤُونِى عَدَا زَيْدًا [which<br>\
means the like]; putting what follows it in the<br>\
accus. case; the agent being implied in it: (S:<br>\
[see this expl. in what has been said of خَلَا as<br>\
used in the same manner:]) accord. to MF, it<br>\
is a verb when what follows it is put in the<br>\
accus. case; and when what follows it is put in<br>\
the gen. case, it is a particle, by common<br>\
consent: (TA: [and the like is said in the<br>\
Mughnee; i. e., that it is similar to خَلَا in respect<br>\
of the explanations there given of the different<br>\
usages of this latter; but that Sb did not know it<br>\
to have been used otherwise than as having the<br>\
quality of a verb:]) one says, رَأَيْتُهُمْ عَدَا أَخَاكَ<br>\
and مَا عَدَاهُ, meaning مَا خَلَا [i. e. I saw them,<br>\
except thy brother]: and sometimes it governs<br>\
the gen. case without ما: thus in the M: Az<br>\
says, [as though regarding it as only a particle,]<br>\
when you suppress [ما], you make it to govern<br>\
the accus. case as meaning إِلَّا and you make it<br>\
to govern the gen. case as meaning سِوَى.<br>\
(TA.<br>\
2<br>\
عداهٌ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَعْدِيَةٌ, (K,) He made<br>\
him, or it, to pass [from a thing, or an affair, to<br>\
another: see 1, first sentence]: (S, K:) and he<br>\
made it to pass through, and go beyond; syn.<br>\
أَنْفَذَهُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence تَعْدِيَةُ الفِعْلِ, a phrase of<br>\
the grammarians, [generally meaning (assumed tropical:)  The making the verb transitive,] as in خَرَجَ زَيْدٌ فَأَخْرَجْتُهُ<br>\
[Zeyd went forth and I made him to go forth].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\

3<br>\
عاداهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. مُعَادَاةٌ, (S, K, TA,)<br>\

or hostility:] the verb in this phrase is that of<br>\
which the epithet is عَدُوٌّ, and the subst. is عَدَاوَةٌ.<br>\
(K, TA.) [It is perhaps from one of the three<br>\
phrases next following]. ―<br>\
-b2-  عادى الشَّىْءَ signifies<br>\
He was, or became, distant, or aloof, from the<br>\
thing; or he made the thing to be, or become,<br>\
distant, or aloof; syn. بَاعَدَهُ. (TA.) And you<br>\
say, فُلَانٌ لَا يُعَادِينِى وَلَا يُوَادِينِى, meaning لَا<br>\
يُجَافِينِى وَلَا يُوَاتِينِى [app. Such a one will not<br>\
make me to be, or become, remote, or aloof, from<br>\
him, nor will he comply with me: but لَا يُوَادِينِى<br>\
properly signifies he will not take from me the<br>\
دِيَة, or bloodwit]. (TA.) And عَادِ رِجْلَكَ عَنِ<br>\
الأَرْضِ Draw away thy leg, or foot, from the<br>\
ground. (TA.) And عَادَى الأَدَاةَ عَنِ البَعِيرِ He<br>\
raised [partially] the furniture (consisting of the<br>\
saddle and saddle-cloth) from contact with the<br>\
camel [so as to render it bearable by him]. (ISh,<br>\
TA in art. غلق.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عادى شَعَرَهُ He took [somewhat] from his hair: or he raised it, (K, TA,)<br>\
in washing it: or he neglected it, and did not oil<br>\
it, or anoint it: or he subjected it time after time<br>\
to the purification termed وُضُوع, and to washing.<br>\

(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  عادى القِدْرَ He lowered one of the three<br>\

that it (the pot) might incline upon the fire.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  عادى بَيْنَ الصَّيْدَينِ, (S, * K,) inf. n.<br>\
عِدَآءٌ (S, K) and مُعَادَاةٌ, (K,) He made a succession, of one to the other, between the two animals<br>\
of the chase, (S, K,) by throwing down one of<br>\
them immediately after the other, (S,) in one<br>\
طَلَق [or heat]. (S, K.) Imra-el-Keys says,<br>\
[describing a horse,]<br>\
فَعَادَى عِدَآءً بَيْنَ ثَوْرٍ وَنَعْجَةٍ<br>\
دِرَاكًا وَلَمْ يَنْضَحْ بِمَآءٍ فَيُغْسَلِ<br>\
[And he made a succession, of one to the other,<br>\
between a wild bull and a wild cow, by running<br>\
down one after the other in a single heat, overtaking uninterruptedly, and not breaking out with<br>\
water (i. e. sweat) so as to become suffused therewith]. (S. [See EM p. 49.]) In like manner<br>\
also المُعَادَاةُ بَيْنَ رَجُلَيْنِ means The piercing, or<br>\
thrusting, two men, one after the other, uninterruptedly. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And عَادَيْتُهُ [sometimes]<br>\
signifies I vied, or contended, with him in running;<br>\
i. q. حَاضَرْتُهُ, from الحُضْرُ. (A in art. حضر.)<br>\
4<br>\
اعدى الأَمْرَ He passed from, or beyond,<br>\
another, to the thing, or affair: so in the K.<br>\
(TA.) But in the M it is said, اعداهُ الدَّآءُ signifies The disease passed from another to him.<br>\
(TA.) And one says أَعْدَى فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا مِنْ خُلُقِهِ,<br>\
or مِنْ عِلَّةٍ بِهِ, or جَرَبٍ, (S, TA,) i. e. Such a one<br>\
made somewhat of his natural disposition, or of a<br>\
disease, or malady, that was in him, or of mange,<br>\
or scab, to pass [from him] to such a one; [or infected him therewith; (see two exs., in a verse<br>\
and a hemistich, cited in the first paragraph of<br>\
art. جنى;)] and اعداهُ بِهِ signifies the same: and<br>\
اعدى صَاحِبَهُ He made his companion to acquire<br>\
the like of what was in him. (TA.) And يُعْدِى<br>\
is said of the mange, or scab, &amp;c., meaning It<br>\
passes from him that has it to another; (S, K;)<br>\
and in like manner one says of a disease,<br>\
↓ يتعدّى: (Nh, TA:) but it is said in an explanation of a trad., لَا يُعْدِى شَىْءٌ شَيْئًا [i. e. A thing<br>\
(meaning disease) does not pass by its own agency<br>\
to a thing]. (S, TA.) [Therefore] one says, of<br>\
the mange, or scab, [or the like,] اعداهُ اللّٰهُ God<br>\
made it to pass from him that had it to one that<br>\
was near to him, so that he became affected therewith. (Msb.) ―<br>\

a pace nearly the same as that termed هَرْوَلَة,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) not so quick, (TA,) or which is not<br>\
so quick, (Msb,) as that termed جَرْى: (Msb,<br>\

and so ↓ عَدًى; (K, TA; [see both voce عَادٍ,<br>\
last sentence;]) thus in the M; (TA;) and the<br>\
pl. is أَعْدَآءٌ; (K, TA;) or this last signifies<br>\
[particularly] the sides of a valley, and so do<br>\
↓ عِدًى and ↓ عَدًى: (TA:) the pl. of عُدْوَةٌ and<br>\
↓ عِدْوَةٌ is عِدَآءٌ and [of عُدْوَةٌ] عُدَيَاتٌ also. (S.)<br>\

the حَصْبَة, and the جُذَام, and the وَبَآء, and the<br>\

فَإِنَّ بِهِ عَدْوَى Do not thou bring him near to<br>\
him, for in him is a disease such as the mange,<br>\

-b2-  And The transition of the mange, or scab,<br>\

(S, K, TA, TK:) the subst. from يَعْدُو said of<br>\
the mange, or scab, expl. above, as meaning “ it<br>\
passes ” &amp;c. (Msb. [See 1, first quarter.]) It<br>\
is said in a trad., لَا عَدْوَى, i. e. لَا يُعْدِى شَىْءٌ<br>\
شَيْئًا [A thing (meaning disease) does not pass by<br>\
its own agency to a thing]; (S;) or [lit.] there<br>\
is no transition of the mange, or scab, or other<br>\
disease, from him that has it to another. (TK.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And i. q. فَسَادٌ [i. e. Badness, corruptness, unsoundness, &amp;c.]. (K, TA. [In the CK erroneously written in this sense عُدْوٰى; which, however, being an inf. n. of عَدَا in the phrase عَدَا<br>\
عَلَيْهِ, q. v., may be correctly used as having the<br>\

saying, ?? [In him, or it, is badness, &amp;c.].<br>\
(TK.)<br>\
-A2-  A(??) A demand that one makes upon a<br>\
prefect, or governor, [or judge,] to aid, or assist,<br>\

inflict penal retribution on him, (IF, S, Msb,)<br>\
for his wrongdoing to him. (IF, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
Aid, or assistance, against a wrongdoer, (S, Mgh,<br>\
TA,) required of a judge, for the bringing into<br>\
his presence the antagonist: and also applied to a<br>\

عُدَوَآءُ (S, K) and ↓ عَادِيَةٌ and ↓ عَدَآءٌ (K)<br>\
Distance, or remoteness, (S, K, TA,) as also<br>\

[Hence,] one says, طَالَتْ عُدَوَاؤُهُمْ Their distance,<br>\

(i. e. the first and ↓ second and ↓ third words)<br>\
Occupation, or business, that turns one away, or<br>\

a custom, or habit, of occupation or business:<br>\
(TA:) and عُدَوَآءُ الشُّغْلِ, the hindrances, or impediments, of occupation or business: (S, TA:) and<br>\
one says, جِئْتَنِى وَأَنَا فِى عُدَوَآءَ عَنْكَ i. e. [Thou<br>\
camest to me when I was engaged] in an occupation that diverted [me from thee]: (so in one of<br>\
my copies of the S:) the pl. of ↓ عَادِيَةٌ is عَوَادٍ:<br>\
(TA:) عَوَادِى الدَّهْرِ means the accidents, or casualties, of time or fortune, that divert [or intervene<br>\
as obstacles] by occupying or busying: (S:) and<br>\
you say, عَوَادِ ↓ عَدَتْ, [lit.] meaning Things, or<br>\
events, turning away, or back, turned, or have<br>\
turned, away, or back; [but this phrase, when<br>\
followed by دُونَ or بَيْنَ, I would rather render,<br>\
simply, obstacles occurred, or have occurred;] (S,<br>\
TA;) thus in the latter of two verses cited voce<br>\
حَبَّ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عُدَوَآءُ الدَّهْرِ means The shifting,<br>\
and varying, of time or fortune. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
عُدَوَآءُ الشَّوْقِ What has severely affected, distressed,<br>\
or afflicted, its sufferer, of the yearning, or longing, of the soul, or of longing desire. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And عُدَوَآءُ signifies also A مَرْكَب [i. e. beast, or<br>\
saddle, or thing on which one rides,] that is not<br>\
easy: (K:) or, accord. to As, a place where he<br>\
who sits thereon is not in a state of ease: and one<br>\
says, جِئْتُ عَلَى مَرْكَبٍ ذِى عُدَوَآءَ i. e. [I came<br>\
upon a beast, or saddle, &amp;c.,] that was not easy:<br>\
(S:) and جِئْتُكَ عَلَى فَرَسٍ ذِى عُدَوَآءَ, the last<br>\
word imperfectly decl., i. e. [I came to thee upon<br>\
a horse] that was not easy: (TA:) and جَلَسَ<br>\
عَلَى عُدَوَآءَ He sat upon an uneven thing or place;<br>\
(M, TA;) the last word imperfectly decl., as is<br>\
said by ISd. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also Dry, hard, land;<br>\
(K, TA;) sometimes occurring in a well when it<br>\
is dug; and sometimes it is stone, from which the<br>\
digger turns aside: and one says, أَرْضٌ ذَاتُ<br>\
عُدَوَآءَ, meaning land that is not even, or plain;<br>\
not easy to walk or ride or lie upon: or, as some<br>\
say, it means a rough, rugged, place: or an elevated place upon which the camel lies down and<br>\
then reclines thereon upon his side, having by his<br>\
side a depressed place, which causes him to tend<br>\
downwards, in consequence whereof he becomes in<br>\
the state termed تَوَهُّنٌ, [weak, or languid, and<br>\
unable to rise,] i. e. in the condition of extending<br>\
his body towards the low place while his legs are<br>\
upon the عُدَوَآء, which is the elevated, so that he is<br>\
unable to rise, and dies. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And [it is<br>\
said that] العُدَوَآءُ also signifies اناخة قليلة [app.<br>\
إِنَاخَةٌ قَلِيلَةٌ, meaning A little, or brief, making of<br>\
a camel to lie down upon the breast, as is done on<br>\
the occasions of mounting and dismounting &amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عُدْوِىٌّ and عُدَوِىٌّ [are rel. ns. of which only<br>\
the fem. forms are mentioned, in what here<br>\
follows]. عُدْوِيَّةٌ and عُدَوِيَّةٌ are rel. ns. of عُدْوَةٌ<br>\
as meaning “ the kind of plants, or herbage,<br>\
termed خُلَّة,” the former reg. and the latter<br>\
irreg.; and عَوَادٍ [pl. of ↓ عَادٍ or of عَادِيَةٌ] is a<br>\
possessive epithet [from the same], without the<br>\
relative ى: [all are app. applied to camels, as<br>\
meaning Having for their pasture the plants, or<br>\
herbage, called عُدْوَة, above mentioned: but it is<br>\
immediately added,] and عُدْوِيَّةٌ and عُدَوِيَّةٌ applied to camels signify that pasture upon the<br>\
[plants called] حَمْض: (TA:) and ↓ عَادِيَةٌ and<br>\
[the pl.] عَوَادٍ, so applied, have this latter meaning accord. to the M and K: but accord. to the<br>\
S, they are applied to camels as meaning abiding<br>\
among the [trees called] عِضَاه, not quitting them,<br>\
and not pasturing upon the حَمْض; and so is [the<br>\
pl.] عَادِيَاتٌ. (TA in another portion of this art.)<br>\
[See also عَاذِيَةٌ, in art. عذو.]<br>\
عِدَوِىٌّ, being a rel. n. of عِدَةٌ, see in art. وعد.<br>\
عَدَوِيَّةٌ The herbage of the صَيْف [q. v., here<br>\
app. meaning spring], after the departure of the<br>\
رَبِيع [q. v., here app. meaning winter]: (S, K:)<br>\
it is applied to the young trees which then become<br>\
green and are depastured by the camels: (S:) or,<br>\
as some say, the [plants, or herbage, called] رَبْل<br>\
[q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The young ones of sheep<br>\
or goats. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Female infants [of the<br>\
age] of forty days; (K, TA; [in the CK, نَبات<br>\
is erroneously put for بَنَات;]) but when their<br>\
[hair termed] عَقِيقَة has been cut off, this appel-lation is no longer applied to them: so says Lth;<br>\
but Az pronounces him to have erred: (TA:) or<br>\
it is with غ (K, TA) and ذ, both dotted, or only<br>\
the former of them dotted, and one of them is<br>\
called غَدِىٌّ [or غَدَوِىٌّ, or غَذِىٌّ or غَذَوِىٌّ]:<br>\
thus in the M, and thus accord. to Az. (TA.)<br>\
عُدْوَانٌ [expl. in the S as signifying Sheer or<br>\
unmixed, wrongful or unjust or injurious or tyrannical conduct,] is an inf. n. of عَدَا in the phrase<br>\
عَدَا عَلَيْهِ [q. v.]; (ISd, Msb, K;) as also عِدْوَانٌ.<br>\
(ISd, K.)<br>\
عَدَوَانٌ, applied to a wolf, (S, K,) means يَعْدُو<br>\
عَلَى النَّاسِ [i. e. That acts aggressively against<br>\
men]; (S, TA;) i. q. ↓ عَادٍ [app. in this sense],<br>\
(K, TA,) which occurs in a trad. applied to a<br>\
beast of prey, (TA,) an epithet applied to a beast<br>\
of prey by the Prophet: (Mgh:) one says سَبُعٌ<br>\
عَادٍ and سِبَاعٌ عَادِيَةٌ. (Msb.) [In the S, immediately after the words يَعْدُو عَلَى النَّاسِ, it is added,<br>\
and hence their saying, السُّلْطَانُ ذُو عَدَوَانٍ وَذُو<br>\
بَدَوَانٍ; and thus I find the saying cited as from<br>\
the S in arts. عدو and بدو of the PS: but I<br>\
think that عَدَوَانٍ and بَدَوَانٍ, here, are mistranscriptions for عَدَوَاتٍ and بَدَوَاتٍ, as I find them<br>\
written in my copies of the S and TA in the arts.<br>\
above mentioned: see عَدْوَةٌ, above; and see<br>\
بَدَآءٌ in art. بدو, where it seems to be clearly<br>\
shown that بَدَوَاتٍ is correct, as pl. of بَدَاةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, (S, K, and Ham p. 81,) and ↓ عَدَّآءٌ, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K, and Ham ubi suprà,) That runs vehemently, or much; (S, Mgh, Msb, K; *) i. q.<br>\
شَدِيدُ العَدْوِ, (S, TA,) or كَثِيرُ العَدْوِ; (Ham;)<br>\
applied to a horse: (Mgh, and Ham:) [and to a<br>\
man:] الشَّدِيدَةُ, in the K, is a mistake for<br>\
الشَّدِيدُهُ, meaning الشَّدِيدُ العَدْوِ. (TA.)<br>\
عَدَآءٌ an inf. n. of عَدَا in the phrase عَدَا عَلَيْهِ<br>\
[q. v.]. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, as also<br>\
↓ عِدَآءٌ, A single طَلَق [or heat; i. e., a single run,<br>\
at once, to a goal, or limit]; (K, TA;) of a<br>\
horse. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And عَدَآءُ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ, (S, K,) as<br>\
also ↓ عِدَاهُ, (K, TA,) [the latter written in the<br>\
CK عِداؤُهُ, but] the former is with the lengthened<br>\
ا and the latter with the shortened ا, (TA,) and<br>\
↓ عِدْوُهُ and ↓ عِدْوَتُهُ and ↓ عُدْوَتُهُ, (K,) signify<br>\
طَوَارُهُ, (S, K,) i. e. [The equal, of anything, in<br>\
breadth and length; or] what is coextensive with<br>\
anything in its breadth and its length. (S, TA.)<br>\
One says, لَزِمْتُ عَدَآءَ الطَّرِيقِ, or النَّهْرِ, or الجَبَلِ,<br>\
meaning طَوَارَهُ [i. e. I kept to the tract coextensive in its breadth and its length with the road, or<br>\
the river, or the mountain]. (TA.)<br>\

عَدُوٌّ And enemy, contr. of وَلِىٌّ, (S,) or of صَدِيقٌ,<br>\
(K,) or of صَدِيقٌ مُوَالٍ; (Msb;) an epithet, but<br>\
resembling a subst.: (S:) [and (like our word<br>\
“ enemy ” in military parlance) a hostile party:<br>\
for] it is used alike as sing. and pl. and masc.<br>\
and fem.; (Msb, K;) as is said in the “ Muk-<br>\
tasar el-&#39; Eyn: ” (Msb:) but sometimes it is<br>\
dualized and pluralized and feminized: (K:)<br>\
the pl. is أَعْدَآءٌ; (S, Msb, K;) and the pl. of<br>\
أَعْدَآءٌ is أَعَادٍ; (Msb, K; *) and عِدًى and عُدًى<br>\
are also pls. of عَدُوٌّ; (S, Msb, K; [each improperly termed in the K اِسْمُ جَمْعٍ; for فِعَلٌ and<br>\
فُعَلٌ are measures of pls., not of quasi-pl. ns.;])<br>\
the former said by ISk to be the only pl. of this<br>\
measure among epithets; (S, Msb; *) and عُدَاةٌ,<br>\
with damm and with ة, is another pl.; (Th, S,<br>\
Msb;) and is pl. of ↓ عَادٍ, (K, TA,) which is<br>\
syn. with عَدُوٌّ; (S, K, TA;) as in the saying of<br>\
a woman of the Arabs, أَشْمَتَ رَبُّ العَالَمِينَ عَادِيَكَ<br>\
[May the Lord of the beings of the universe make<br>\
thy enemy to rejoice at thy affliction]: (S, TA:)<br>\
the fem. form of عَدُوٌّ is عَدُوَّةٌ, (S, Msb,) which is<br>\
said by Az to be used when the meaning of an<br>\
epithet is intended: (Msb:) it is said by ISk,<br>\
(S, TA,) and in the “ Bari&#39;,” (Msb,) that there<br>\
is no instance of the measure فَعُولٌ in the sense<br>\
of فَاعِلٌ but its fem. is without ة, except عَدُوَّةٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) in the phrase هٰذِهِ عَدُوَّةٌ اللّٰهِ [This<br>\
woman is the enemy of God]: accord. to Fr,<br>\
عَدُوَّةٌ has the affix ة to assimilate it to صَدِيقَةٌ;<br>\
for a word is sometimes formed to accord with<br>\
its contr.: (S, TA:) AZ says that he heard<br>\
certain of the tribe of &#39;Okeyl say, [of some<br>\
women,] هُنَّ وَلِيَّاتُ اللّٰهِ and عَدُوَّاتُ اللّٰهِ and أًوْلِيَاؤُهُ<br>\

the enemies of God]. (Msb.) [The pl.] عِدًى<br>\
signifies also Persons distant, or remote, one from<br>\
another: (ISd, K, TA:) and (K) strangers, or<br>\
foreigners: (ISk, S, K, TA:) and such as are<br>\

not relations: (TA:) as well as enemies: (M,<br>\
TA:) كَالأَعْدَآءِ, which is added in the K after<br>\

عَدِىٌّ is a pl. [or rather a quasi-pl. n.] of عَادٍ,<br>\
q. v. (S, TA.)<br>\
عَدَاوَةٌ Enmity, or hostility; (S, K, TA;) like<br>\

-b4-  ↓ عَدِىٌّ<br>\
is a pl. of عَادٍ, [or rather a quasi-pl. n.,] like as<br>\
غَزِىٌّ is of غَازٍ; as such signifying Runners upon<br>\

TA,) in the dial. of Hudheyl, (TA,) that run to<br>\
the fight (K, TA) and the like: (TA:) or the<br>\
first, of the footmen, [or foot-soldiers,] that charge,<br>\
or assault; (K, TA;) because they run quickly:<br>\
(TA:) like عَادِيَةٌ, (K, TA,) of which the pl. is<br>\
عَوَادٍ, (TA,) in both senses: or this signifies the<br>\
horsemen; (K, TA;) i. e. the first, of the horsemen, that charge, or assault, in a hostile, or predatory, incursion, especially; (TA;) or horses<br>\
making a hostile, or predatory, incursion; and<br>\
hence [the pl.] العَادِيَات in the Kur c. 1. (TA in<br>\
the supplement to this art.) And accord. to ElKhuwárezmee, عَدِىٌّ particularly signifies The<br>\
foot-messengers of the sovereign, and of the judge,<br>\
who are made to run in quest of one against whom<br>\
an accusation has been made, and to bring him,<br>\

the mange, or scab, is a prov. (Meyd.) And<br>\
أَعْدَى مِنَ الثُّؤَبَآءِ is another prov., having a similar<br>\
meaning [i. e. More wont to pass from one to<br>\
another, or, as we commonly say, more catching,<br>\
than yawning]; (Meyd;) for when a man yawns<br>\
in the presence of others, they become affected as<br>\
he is. (TA in art. ثأب.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَعْدَى مِنَ الذِّئْبِ is<br>\
also a prov., and may mean More wrongful, or<br>\
more inimical, or more vehement in running, than<br>\

prov., (expl. in the latter half of the first paragraph,) is from العَدْوُ. (Meyd.) ―<br>\
-b3-  هُوَ أَعْدَى شَىْءٍ<br>\

aid, or assist, or to avenge; أَعْدَى in this case<br>\
being irregularly formed from the augmented<br>\
verb in the phrase أَعْدَاهُ عَلَيْهِ]. (TA in art. ادو:<br>\
see آدَى in that art.)<br>\

فُلَانٌ مَعْدِىٌّ عَلَيْهِ and ↓ مَعْدُوٌّ (S, K *) mean<br>\
