load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'عبقرعَبْقَرٌ: see the following paragraph, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
عَبْقَرِىٌّ a rel. n. from ↓ عَبْقَرٌ, a place which the<br>\
Arabs assert to be of the lands of the Jinn, or<br>\
Genii: (S, O, Msb:) or a certain place, (K,)<br>\
in the desert, (TA,) abounding with Jinn: (K:)<br>\
AO says, We have not found any one who<br>\
knows where this country is, or when it existed.<br>\
(TA.) Hence it is applied as an epithet to anything wondered at, or admired, for the skilfulness<br>\
which it exhibits, or the excellence of its manufacture, and its strength: (S, O:) or to any<br>\
work great in estimation, and fine, and delicate:<br>\
(Msb:) it is both sing. and pl.; and the fem. is<br>\
عَبْقَرِيَّةٌ: you say, ثِيَابٌ عَبْقَرِيَّةٌ [Cloths, or garments, of admirable manufacture]: (S, O:) [or<br>\
such are so called in relation to a certain town;<br>\
for] ↓ عَبْقَرٌ is also a town (M, K) in El-Yemen,<br>\
(M,) or, accord. to the Moajam, in El-Jezeereh,<br>\
in which cloths or garments, and carpets, are<br>\
variegated, or figured, (TA,) and of which the<br>\
cloths or garments are of the utmost beauty.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A kind of carpets, (S, O, K,)<br>\
variously dyed and figured: upon such the<br>\
Prophet used to prostrate himself when he<br>\
prayed: (S, O:) as also ↓ عَبَاقِرِىٌّ: (K:) and<br>\
some read عَبَاقِرِىّ in the Kur lv. 76: (S, O:) as<br>\
pl. of عَبْقَرِىٌّ: (TA:) but this is a mistake; for<br>\
a rel. n. has no such pl; (S;) unless it be from<br>\
a sing. n. of a pl. form, like حَضَاجِرِىٌّ from<br>\
حَضَاجِرُ, and so be a rel. n. from عَبَاقِرُ: so say<br>\
the skilful grammarians, Kh and Sb and Ks: Az<br>\
mentions the reading ↓ عَبَاقَرِىّ, with fet-h to the<br>\
ق; as though it were a rel. n. from عَبَاقَرٌ: Fr<br>\
says that عَبْقَرِىٌّ signifies thick [carpets of the<br>\
kind called] طَنَافِسَ: and also silk brocade; syn.<br>\
دِيبَاجٌ: Kt, that it signifies what are called زَرَابِىّ:<br>\
Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Jubeyr, that it signifies excellent زرابىّ:<br>\
(TA:) the n. un. is عَبْقَرِيَّةٌ. (Fr, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
Good, or excellent; applied to an animal, and to<br>\
a jewel. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Perfect, or complete; applied<br>\
to anything. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  A pure, unmixed, lie;<br>\
(O, K, * TA;) that has no truth mixed with it.<br>\
(O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  A lord, or chief, (O, K,) of men:<br>\
(TA:) or (TA, in the K, “and ”) one who has<br>\
none above him: and strong. (K.) You say<br>\
of a strong man, هٰذَا عَبْقَرِىُّ قَوْمٍ: (S, O:) or<br>\
this means This is a chief, or lord, of a people:<br>\
(As, on the authority of &#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;Alà:)<br>\
and in a trad. it is said that the Prophet<br>\
related a dream, mentioning &#39;Omar, and said,<br>\
فَلَمْ أَرَ عَبْقَرِيًّا يَفْرِى فَرِيَّهُ [And I have not seen a<br>\
chief of a people do his wonderful deeds]. (S, *<br>\
O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  It is also applied as an epithet denoting superlativeness [of any quality]. (TA.)<br>\
They even said ظُلْمٌ عَبْقَرِىٌّ [Excessive, or extreme, wrongdoing]. (S, O.)<br>\
عَبَاقِرِىٌّ and عَبَاقَرِىٌّ: see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
