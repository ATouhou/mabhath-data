عَتَرَ, aor.<br>\
عَتِرَ, inf. n. عَتْرٌ [and تَعْتَارٌ (mentioned<br>\
below in this paragraph), a form denoting repetition, or frequency, of the action, or its application to several objects, or it may be an inf. n.<br>\
of which the verb is ↓ عتّر], He slaughtered [or<br>\
sacrificed] (S, O, K, TA) an عَتِيرَة, (S, O,)<br>\
[i. e.] a sheep or goat, or a gazelle or the like.<br>\
(TA.) Sometimes a man, (S, O,) of the people<br>\
of the Time of Ignorance, (S,) made a vow that,<br>\
if he should see what he loved, he would<br>\
slaughter such and such of his sheep or goats;<br>\
and when the performance of the vow became<br>\
obligatory, he would be unwilling to do so, and<br>\
would slaughter gazelles instead of the sheep or<br>\
goats: (S, O:) sometimes he would say, “If<br>\
my camels amount to a hundred, I will slaughter<br>\
for them an عَتِيرَة; ” but when they amounted to<br>\
a hundred, he would be niggardly of the sheep or<br>\
goat, and would hunt a gazelle, and slaughter it.<br>\
(TA.) One says, هٰذِهِ أَيَّامُ تَرْجِيبٍ and تَعْتَارٍ<br>\
[These are days of the sacrificing of the عَتِيرَة].<br>\
(S, O.)<br>\
2<br>\
عَتَّرَ see above, first sentence.<br>\
عِتْرٌ Origin, or original state or condition; (S,<br>\
O, K;) and natural disposition; like عِكْرٌ. (O.)<br>\
One says, هُوَ كَرِيمُ العِتْرِ He is of generous origin.<br>\
(TK.) And it is said in a prov., عَادَتْ إِلَى عِتْرِهَا<br>\
لَمِيسُ Lemees [a proper name of a woman] returned to her original state or condition (S, O)<br>\
and natural disposition: (O:) applied to him<br>\
who has returned to a natural disposition which<br>\
he had relinquished. (S, O.) [See also عِكْرٌ.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also A certain plant, (S, O, K,) used medicinally,<br>\
like the مَرْزَنْجُوش [or marjoram]; (S;) growing<br>\
like this latter plant, in a straggling manner; and<br>\
when it has grown tall, and its stem is cut, there<br>\
comes forth from it what resembles milk: (TA:)<br>\
accord. to Aboo-Ziyád, it is a plant of those<br>\
termed أَحْرَار [pl. of حُرٌّ], having a small round<br>\
fruit (جُرَىّ [dim. of جِرْوٌ]), which is sweet, or<br>\
pleasant in taste, eaten by men; and it grows like<br>\
as does the poppy, but is smaller: (AHn, O:) or<br>\
certain small trees [or plants], (S, K, TA,)<br>\
having round fruits (جِرَآء [pl. of جِرْوٌ]), like those<br>\
of the poppy: (TA as on the authority of AHn:)<br>\
AHn says, (O,) some assert it to mean the<br>\
مَرْزَنْجُوش; (O, TA;) but, he adds, this I have<br>\
not found to be known: (O:) and some say that<br>\
it is the عَرْفَج: (TA:) the n. un. is عِتْرَةٌ: (S,<br>\
O:) AHn says, a desert-Arab of Rabee&#39;ah told<br>\
me that this is a small tree [or plant], that rises<br>\
to the height of a cubit, having many branches,<br>\
and green, round leaves, like the تَنُّوم, and round<br>\
fruits (جِرَآء), which are in pairs, near together,<br>\
hanging down towards the ground, and sweet, or<br>\
pleasant in taste, their taste being like that of<br>\
small cucumbers: it seldom, or never, grows singly,<br>\
but is found in pairs, or in fours, in one place:<br>\
and some assert that it abounds with milk: (O:)<br>\
it is also said to be a tree [or plant] that grows<br>\
by the burrow of the [lizard called] ضَبّ, which<br>\
mumbles it so that it does not increase; whence<br>\
the saying هُوَ أَذَلُّ مِنْ عِتْرَةِ الضَّبِّ [He is more<br>\
vile than the عترة of the ضبّ]: and it is also said,<br>\
in the K, to signify the مَرْزَنْجُوش, mentioned<br>\
above as being said to be a signification of عِتْرٌ:<br>\
(TA:) also, the caper. (K, * TA.) It is said in<br>\
a trad. that there is no harm in a man&#39;s treating<br>\
himself medically with senna and عِتْر while in a<br>\
state of إِحْرَام: (S, O:) which, some say, means<br>\
that there is no harm in taking these from the<br>\
sacred territory for such treatment. (O.)<br>\
-A3-  Also<br>\
An idol, (O, K,) such as had victims (عَتَائِر)<br>\
sacrificed to it. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also عَتِيرَةٌ.<br>\
عِتْرَةٌ The stem, or stock, of a tree: on the<br>\
authority of Aboo-Sa&#39;eed and IAar: (TA:) and<br>\
the branches of a tree. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And<br>\
hence,] (assumed tropical:)  The people, or tribe, of a man, consisting of his nearer relations, (A&#39;Obeyd, ISk, S,<br>\
A, O, Msb, K,) both the dead and the living:<br>\
(S, K:) or his relations: (Msb:) or his relations<br>\
consisting of his offspring and his paternal uncle&#39;s<br>\
sons: (A:) or his relations consisting of his offspring and of others: (TA:) or the more distinguished of one&#39;s relations: (IAth, TA:) or the<br>\
people of a man&#39;s house, the more near and more<br>\
distant: (O, TA:) and a man&#39;s offspring, or<br>\
progeny; (IAar, Th, Az, S, O, Msb, K;) which<br>\
is said to be the only meaning of the word known<br>\
to the Arabs; (Msb;) or imagined by the vulgar<br>\
to be its meaning peculiarly. (TA.) عِتْرَةُ النَّبِىِّ<br>\
means [The nearer portion of the tribe of the<br>\
Prophet, consisting of] the sons of &#39;Abd-El-Mut-<br>\
talib: (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, O:) or &#39;Abd-El-Muttalib<br>\
and his sons: (TA:) or the offspring of Fátimeh:<br>\
(IAar, TA:) or the nearer members of the house<br>\
of the Prophet, consisting of his own offspring<br>\
and of &#39;Alee and his offspring: or the nearer<br>\
and the more distant in relationship of the house of<br>\
the Prophet: or, as is commonly held, the people of<br>\
the house of the Prophet; who are those from whom<br>\
it is forbidden to exact the poor-rate, and those to<br>\
whom is assigned the fifth of the fifth mentioned<br>\
in the Soorat el-Anfál [the eighth chapter of the<br>\
Kur-án, verse 42]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also n. un. of عِتْرٌ<br>\
[q. v.]. (S, O.)<br>\
عَتِيرَةٌ A sheep, or goat, which they used to<br>\
slaughter, (S, O, Msb, K,) in [the month of]<br>\
Rejeb, (S, O, Msb,) to their gods, (S, O, K,) or<br>\
to their idols; (Msb;) i. q. رَجَبِيَّةٌ, (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
TA,) i. e. a victim which was sacrificed in Rejeb,<br>\
as a propitiation, in the Time of Ignorance,<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, Mgh, TA,) and also by the Muslims in<br>\
the beginning of El-Islám; (Mgh;) but the custom<br>\
was afterwards abolished; (A&#39;Obeyd, Mgh, O;)<br>\
as also ↓ عِتْرٌ; (S, O, K;) which likewise signifies<br>\
any slaughtered animal; (K;) and so does ↓ عَاتِرَةٌ;<br>\
this being like رَاضِيَةٌ, in the phrase عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ,<br>\
for مَرْضِيَّةٌ; (Lth, TA;) or it may be a possessive<br>\
epithet [meaning ذَاتُ عَتْرٍ]: (TA:) the pl. of عَتِيرَةٌ<br>\
is عَتَائِرُ. (Msb.)<br>\
عَاتِرَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
