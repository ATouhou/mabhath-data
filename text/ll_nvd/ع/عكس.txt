عَكَسَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَكِسَ, (A, * Msb, K, *) inf. n. عَكْسٌ,<br>\
(S, A, O, Msb, K,) He reversed it; made the<br>\
last part of it to be first, and the first to be last;<br>\
or turned it kind part before, and fore part behind.<br>\
(S, A, O, Msb, K.) [Hence,] عَكَسَ الكَلَامَ وَنَحْوَهُ,<br>\
(A, O, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (O,) He inverted, reversed, converted, or transposed, the<br>\
language or sentence, and the like; [as, for instance, a word;] he changed its order by inversion<br>\
or transposition: (A, O, K:) sometimes a word,<br>\
when this is done, remains as at first; as in the<br>\
instances of بَابٌ and خَوْخٌ and عَكَوْكَعٌ: (TA:)<br>\
or he perverted its order (TA) [or its meaning:<br>\
see مَعْكُوسٌ]. [Hence the phrase بِالْعَكْسِ Vice<br>\
versâ.] One says to him who speaks wrongly,<br>\
لاَ تَعْكِسْ [Pervert not thou]. (A.) And ↓ مُعَاكَسَةٌ<br>\
with respect to language and the like is like عَكْسٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, said of a mirror and the like,<br>\
It reflected it; namely, an object before it; because the object seen in it is reversed.] ―<br>\
-b3-  From<br>\
the first of the significations mentioned above is<br>\
derived the expression [used by the Arabs in the<br>\
“ Time of Ignorance ”], عَكْسُ البَلِيَّةِ عِنْدَ القَبْرِ [The<br>\
tying, with her head turned backwards, of the she-camel that is left to die at the grave in which her<br>\
master is buried]; because they used to tie her<br>\
with her head turned backwards towards the<br>\
part next her breast and belly, or, as some say,<br>\
towards her hinder part next the back, and to<br>\
leave her in that state until she died. (S, O.)<br>\
And [hence, app.,] العَكْسُ also signifies The confining a beast (دَابَّة) without fodder. (TA.) You<br>\
say also, عَكَسَ رَأْسَ البَعِيرِ, aor.<br>\
عَكِسَ, He turned the<br>\
head of the camel [app. meaning backwards].<br>\
(TA.) And عَكَسَ البَعِيرَ, (IKtt, O, L, Msb,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَكِسَ, (Msb, [in the L,<br>\
عَكُسَ, which is evidently a<br>\
mistranscription,]) inf. n. عَكْسٌ (S, IKtt, O, L, K)<br>\
and عِكَاسٌ, (IKtt, L,) He tied the camel&#39;s neck<br>\
to one of his fore legs while he was lying down:<br>\
(IKtt, L, Msb:) or he tied the camel&#39;s fore shank<br>\
to his (the camel&#39;s) arm with a rope, and then<br>\
turned back the rope beneath his belly and tied it<br>\
to his flank: (IDrd, O:) or he tied a cord in the<br>\
fore part of the nose, or mouth, of the camel, (S,<br>\
O, K,) [attaching it] to his fore legs, (K,) or to<br>\
the pastern of [each of] his fore legs, (S, O,) to<br>\
render him submissive, or tractable: (S, K:) or<br>\
he put a halter (خِطَام) upon the head of the<br>\
camel, and then tied it in a knot upon his knee, to<br>\
prevent his being impetuous: (El-Jaadee:) or,<br>\
accord. to an Arab of the desert, he pulled the<br>\
rein (جَرِير) of the camel, and kept fast hold of<br>\
his head, so that he went an easy and a quick<br>\
pace: and عَكَسَ الدَّابَّةَ is said to signify he pulled<br>\
the head of the beast towards him, to make him<br>\
go backwards. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عَكَسْتُ عَلَيْهِ أَمْرَهُ i. q.<br>\
رَدَدْتُهُ عَلَيْهِ [I reversed to him his affair, or case;<br>\

of what it was to him]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  عَكَسْتُهُ عَنْ أَمْرِهِ<br>\

(TA,) اِعْكِسُوا أَنْفُسَكُمْ عَكْسَ الخَيْلِ بِاللُّجُمِ Rein in,<br>\
or refrain, (TA,) or turn back, (A, TA,) yourselves [as one reins in, &amp;c., horses by means of the<br>\
bits and bridles]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And عَكَسَ الشَّىْءَ He<br>\
pulled the thing towards the ground, and pressed<br>\
