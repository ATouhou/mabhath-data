عَظُمَ, [aor.<br>\
عَظُمَ,] inf. n. عِظَمٌ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
عَظَامَةٌ, (Msb, K,) accord. to El-Isbahánee, primarily signifies He was, or became, great in his<br>\
bone: then metaphorically said of anything كَبِير<br>\
[or great], whether an object of sense or of intel-lect, a substance or an accident: (TA:) i. q. كَبُرَ,<br>\
(S, TA,) said of a thing [as meaning it was, or<br>\
became, great, big, or large], (S, Msb, TA,) in<br>\
length and breadth and thickness: (TA:) [and in<br>\
like manner, metaphorically, said of an object of<br>\
intellect; meaning it was, or became, great in<br>\
estimation or rank or dignity; and thus also said<br>\
of a man: or it imports more than كَبُرَ; signifying it was, or became, great in comparison with<br>\
other things of its kind; huge, enormous, or vast;<br>\
and in a similar sense it is said of a man; and in<br>\
an incomparably higher sense, of God: (see عَظِيمٌ,<br>\
below:)] and ↓ اعظم said of an affair, or event,<br>\
signifies [like عَظُمَ] it became عَظِيم. (TA.) عِظَمٌ<br>\
is the contr. of صِغَرٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَظُمَ عِنْدَهُ, and<br>\
عَظُمَ عَلَيْهِ: see 6, in three places: and see also 4.<br>\
And مَا يَعْظُمُنِى [which is similar in meaning to<br>\
ما يَعْظُمُ عَلَىَّ if not a mistranscription for ما<br>\
يُعْظِمُنِى]: see 4. ―<br>\
-b3-  In the case of expressing<br>\
wonder, one says, عُظْمَ البَطْنُ بَطْنُكَ [How great<br>\
is the belly, thy belly !], contracting عَظُمَ, and<br>\
transferring the vowel of its middle letter to [the<br>\
place of] its first; and thus one does in the case<br>\
of that which denotes praise or blame, and of<br>\
whatever [verb] may be well used in the manner<br>\
of نِعْمَ, and بِئْسَ: but what may not be thus used<br>\
does not admit of the transferring, though it may<br>\
be contracted; so that you may say, حَسُنَ الوَجْهُ<br>\
وَجْهُكَ and حَسْنَ الوَجْهُ وَجْهُكَ and حُسْنَ الوَجْهُ<br>\
وَجْهُكَ, but not قَدْ حُسْنَ الوَجْهُ وَجْهُكَ. (S.)<br>\

i. e. an affair. (S.) [One says, فَعَلْتُ كَذَا تَعْظِيمًا<br>\

&amp;c. to him, or it.] ―<br>\
-b3-  عظّم المَطَرُ, inf. n. as above,<br>\

not frighten me, or terrify me]. (TA.)<br>\

تعظّم [He made himself to appear great,<br>\
big, or large: as is indicated by an explanation<br>\
of the word رُفَاعَة in the S, in art. رفع. ―<br>\

hence,] He magnified himself; or behaved proudly,<br>\
haughtily, or insolently; as also ↓ استعظم; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) [and so ↓ تعاظم: ―<br>\

by him: one says, ↓ سَمِعْتُ خَبَرًا فَأَعْظَمْتُهُ [I heard<br>\
a narration and I judged it to be of great<br>\
moment, &amp;c.]: (TA:) and ↓ تعظّم is thought by<br>\

another or others; differing from كَبِيرٌ, which<br>\
signifies “ great &amp;c. in itself: ” (El-Fakhr Er-Rázee, TA:) or the former is the contr. of حَقِيرٌ;<br>\
[i. e. it signifies of great account or estimation;]<br>\
and as حَقِيرٌ is inferior to صَغِيرٌ, so عَظِيمٌ is superior to كَبِيرٌ; (Ksh and Bd in ii. 6;) and signifies great, or the like, in comparison with other<br>\

dignity; and thus as applied to a man: also of<br>\
great magnitude or moment or importance: of<br>\
great gravity: difficult, hard, severe, grievous,<br>\
