عَضِهَ, said of a camel, (Msb, K,) or عَضِهَت,<br>\
(S, TA,) said of camels, (S,) or of a she-camel,<br>\

عَضَهَ, (S, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n. عَضَهٌ,<br>\

or عَضَهَ العِضَاهَ, like مَنَعَ [in form], inf. n. عَضْهٌ;<br>\
as also ↓ عَضَّهَهَا, inf. n. تَعْضِيهٌ; (so accord. to the<br>\
TA;) He cut the trees called عِضَاه: (K, TA:)<br>\
accord. to AHn, (TA,) ↓ التَّعْضِيهُ signifies the<br>\

عَضْهٌ and عَضَةٌ and عَضِيهَةٌ and عِضْهَةٌ, He lied.<br>\
(K.) And He excited discord, or dissension, and<br>\
made known discourse in a mischievous manner,<br>\
or embellished speech with falsehood; or he calumniated; syn. نَمَّ; (K, TA;) or بَهَتَ: (TA:)<br>\
whence the saying, in a trad., أَتَدْرُونَ مَا العَضْهُ<br>\
(TA) i. e. [Know ye what is] the reporting of conversation, or of what has been said, from one<br>\
person to another, to make mischief between them?<br>\
(El-Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer:) [or,] accord. to IAth,<br>\
the calumnious speech between men? or, accord. to<br>\
As, the evil, or foul, speaking? (TA.) And the<br>\
same verb, (so accord. to my MS. copy of the<br>\
K,) or عَضِهَ, (so accord. to other copies and the<br>\
TA,) He uttered falsehood and calumny; as also<br>\
↓ اعضه: (K, TA:) [whence] one says, قَدْ<br>\

man. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَضَهَ فُلَانًا, (S, * K, TA,)<br>\
[in some copies of the K عَضِهَ, but it is] like مَنَعَ,<br>\

and عِضْهَةٌ, He enchanted: (K, TA:) because<br>\
enchantment is a lying, and a causing to imagine<br>\

trees called عِضَاه. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And اعضه القَوْمُ The<br>\

-A2-  See also 1, latter half, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
عَضِهٌ: see عَاضِهٌ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  أَرْضٌ عَضِهَةٌ<br>\
and ↓ عَضِيهَةٌ (K, TA) and ↓ مُعْضِهَةٌ (S, K, TA)<br>\
A land having trees such as are called عِضَاه:<br>\
(TA:) or abounding with such trees. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
عِضَهٌ [also pronounced ↓ عِضَةٌ] A lie, or falsehood; and a calumny; (Ks, S, K, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ عَضِيهَةٌ: (S, TA: *) the former said by Et-Toosee<br>\
to be a mistranscription for عَضْهٌ; but it is not so:<br>\
(IB, TA:) and it signifies also enchantment, (S,<br>\
K, TA,) and divination: (S, TA:) and its pl.,<br>\
(S, K,) or [rather] the pl. of ↓ عِضَةٌ, (thus accord.<br>\
to the TA and one of my copies of the S,) is<br>\
عِضُونَ, like as عِزُونَ is of عِزَةٌ: (S, K, TA:)<br>\
whence the saying in the Kur [xv. 91], الَّذِينَ<br>\
جَعَلُوا الْقُرْآنَ عِضِينَ [Those who pronounced the<br>\
Kur-án to be lies, or enchantments]: (S, TA:)<br>\
accord. to Fr, [the sing.] ↓ عِضَةٌ is originally عِضَهَةٌ,<br>\
the deficient [radical] letter being ه; (S, * TA;)<br>\
for عِضَةٌ and عِضُونَ in the dial. of Kureysh signify enchantment [and enchantments], and they<br>\
term the enchanter عَاضِهٌ: (S:) or, as some say,<br>\
the deficient [radical] letter is و, (S, TA,) from<br>\
عَضَوْتُهُ meaning فَرَّقْتُهُ, (S,) or from عَضَّيْتُ الشَّىْءَ<br>\
meaning فَرَّقْتُهُ; (TA;) because they divided<br>\
their sayings respecting the Kur-án, pronouncing<br>\
it to be falsehood, or enchantment, or divination,<br>\
or poetry. (S, TA.) And one says, ↓ يَالِلْعَضِيهَةِ,<br>\
with kesr to the ل, [O the lie?] denoting a<br>\
calling to aid; (S;) or said on an occasion of<br>\
wondering at a great lie; and with fet-h to the<br>\
ل [i. e. يَا لَلْعَضِيهَةِ] denoting a calling for aid.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عِضَةٌ, originally عِضَهَةٌ: see عِضَاهٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  And see also عِضَهٌ, in three places: and<br>\
art. عضو.<br>\
عِضَهَةٌ: see عِضَاهٌ.<br>\
عِضَهِىٌّ, applied to a camel, That depastures the<br>\
trees called عِضَاه; as also ↓ عِضَاهِىٌّ so applied;<br>\
(S, K;) and in like manner, applied to camels,<br>\
↓ عِضَاهِيَّةٌ; (S;) the second and third being<br>\
rel. ns. from عِضَةٌ, and therefore irregularly<br>\
formed, or from عِضَاهَةٌ, not from عِضَاهٌ because<br>\
this is a pl. or has the meaning of a pl.: (TA:)<br>\
so too عَضَوِىٌّ applied to a camel, (S, K,) and<br>\
عَضَوِيَّةٌ applied to camels, both with fet-h, irregular. (S.) [See also عَاضِهٌ.]<br>\
عِضَاهٌ Any great trees having thorns; these being<br>\
of two sorts, genuine (خَالِص) and not genuine<br>\
(غَيْرُ خَالِصٍ): the former sort are the عَرْف, the<br>\
عُرْفُط, the طَلْح, the سَلَم, the سِدْر, the سَيَال, the<br>\
سَمْر, the يَنْبُوت, the greater قَتَاد, the كَنَهْبَل, the<br>\
غَرْب, and the عَوْسَج: the other sort are the شَوْحَط.<br>\
the نَبْع, the شِرْيَان, the سَرَآء, the نَشَم, the عُجْرُم,<br>\
and the تأْلَب; and these are called the عِضَاه of<br>\
bows (عِضَاهُ القِيَاسِ [i. e. القِسِىِّ] pl. of قَوْسٌ): the<br>\
small thorny trees are called عِضٌّ [q. v.]: and<br>\
such as are neither عِضّ nor عِضَاه, of thorny<br>\
trees, are the شُكَاعَى, the حُلَاوَى, the حَاذ, the<br>\
كُبّ, and the سُلَّج: (S:) or, as AZ says in the<br>\
beginning of his book of herbage and trees, عِضَاهٌ<br>\
is the general name of certain thorny trees which<br>\
have different particular names: the genuine<br>\
عِضَاه (العِضَاهُ الخَالِصُ) are those which are large<br>\
and have strong thorns: such as are small, of<br>\
thorny trees, are called عِضٌّ and شِرْسٌ [q. v.]: of<br>\
the عِضَاه are the سَمُر, the عُرْفَط, the سَيَال, the قَرَظ,<br>\
the greater قَتَاد, the كَنَهْبَل, the عَوْسَج, the سِدْر,<br>\
the غَاف, and the غَرْب: these are the genuine<br>\
عِضَاه: and of the عِضَاه of bows (عِضَاهُ القِيَاسِ i. e.<br>\
القِسِىِّ) are the شَوْحَط, the نَبْع, the شِرْيَان, and<br>\
the سَرَآء: (TA voce عِضٌّ:) or عِضَاهٌ signifies any<br>\
trees having thorns; as the طَلْح and the عَوْسَج:<br>\
or, accord. to some, except the قَتَاد and the سِدْر:<br>\
(Msb:) or the greatest of trees: or the خَمْط<br>\
[q. v., for it is variously explained]: or any<br>\
having thorns: or such as are great and tall, of<br>\
these: (K:) [حُبْلَةٌ and سِنْفَةٌ are terms applied<br>\
to the fruit, or produce, of trees of the kind called<br>\
عِضَاه: see the former of those words:] a single<br>\
tree thereof is called عِضَاهَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ عِضَهَةٌ<br>\
and ↓ عِضَةٌ, (S, Msb, K, [but in the copies of the<br>\
K the last of these is erroneously written عِضَه,])<br>\
the radical ه being rejected in the last, as it is in<br>\
شَفَةٌ; or, accord. to some, the rejected radical<br>\
letter is و; (AAF, S, Msb; *) opinions differing on<br>\
this point because of the different forms of the pl.;<br>\
(AAF, S, TA;) the pl. being عِضَاهٌ and (of pauc.,<br>\
TA) عِضَوَاتٌ (AAF, S, K, TA, in the CK<br>\
عِضْواتٌ,) and عِضُونَ; (K;) [the second and third<br>\
of which are pls. of ↓ عِضَةٌ;] or, accord. to ISd,<br>\
عِضَاهٌ may be an instance of the kind of pl. that<br>\
differs from its sing, [only] in respect of the ة,<br>\
like قَتَادٌ, of which the sing. is قَتَادَةٌ, [i. e., what<br>\
is more properly termed a coll. gen. n.,] or it<br>\
may be a broken pl., as though its sing. were<br>\
عِضَهَةٌ: (TA:) the dim. [of عِضَهَةٌ] is ↓ عُضَيْهَةٌ. (S,<br>\
TA.) [Hence,] one says, فُلَانٌ يَنْتَجِبُ غَيْرَ عِضَاهِهِ<br>\
[lit. Such a one takes the back of other than his<br>\
own عضاه, to tan therewith]; meaning (assumed tropical:)  such a<br>\
one arrogates to himself the poetry of another.<br>\
(S. See a verse cited in art. نجب.) [See also 1,<br>\
first sentence.]<br>\
عَضِيهَةٌ: see عَضِهٌ.<br>\
-A2-  And see also عِضَهٌ, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
عُضَيْهَةٌ [dim. of عِضَهَةٌ]: see عِضَاهٌ.<br>\
عِضَاهِىٌّ; and its fem., with ة: see عِضَهِىٌّ.<br>\
عَاضِهٌ applied to a he-camel, as also ↓ عَضِهٌ, (S,)<br>\
and عَاضِهَةٌ applied to a she-camel, (S, K,) and<br>\
thus also عَاضِهٌ, (K,) Depasturing the trees called<br>\
عِضَاه; (S, K, TA;) and the pl. [of عَاضِهٌ and<br>\
عَاضِهَةٌ] in this sense, applied to camels, is عَوَاضِهُ:<br>\
(S, TA:) or, accord. to &#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh, (IB,<br>\
TA,) ↓ عَضِهٌ has this meaning; (IB, Msb, TA;)<br>\
but عَاضِهٌ signifies having a complaint from eating<br>\
the عِضَاه: (IB, TA:) or ↓ عَضِهٌ has the latter<br>\
meaning, or the former meaning: or, accord. to<br>\
AHn, عَضِهَةٌ applied to a she-camel signifies<br>\
breaking the branches, or twigs, of the عِضَاه.<br>\
(TA.) [See also عِضَهِىٌّ.]<br>\
-A2-  Also Enchanting,<br>\
or an enchanter; (As, S, K, TA;) in the dial. of<br>\
Kureysh. (As, S, TA.) See also the last paragraph of this art. A poet says,<br>\
أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّى مِنَ النَّافِثَا<br>\
↓ تِ فِى عُقَدِ العَاضِهِ المُعْضِهِ<br>\
[I seek protection by my Lord from the women<br>\
sputtering upon the knots of the lying enchanter:<br>\
see art. نفث, and the Kur-án cxiii. 4]: (S, TA:)<br>\
or, as some relate it, فى عِضَهِ [upon the enchantment]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And حَيَّةٌ عَاضِهٌ and عَاضِهَةٌ A<br>\
serpent that kills instantly (AO, S, K) when it<br>\
bites. (AO, S.)<br>\
مُعْضِهٌ: see its fem. voce عَضِهٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and see the<br>\
verse cited voce عَاضِهٌ.<br>\
مُسْتَعْضِهَةٌ A woman seeking, or demanding, enchantment: hence the trad., ↓ لَعَنَ اللّٰهُ العَاضِهَةَ<br>\
وَالمُسْتَعْضِهَةَ [May God curse her who enchants<br>\
and her who seeks, or demands, enchantment].<br>\
