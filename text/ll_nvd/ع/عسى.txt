عَسَى is [said by some to be] one of the verbs<br>\
of appropinquation, implying eager desire, or<br>\
hope, and fear, and not perfectly inflected, for it<br>\
is applied in the form of the preterite to that<br>\
which occurs in the present: one says عَسَى زَيْدٌ<br>\
أَنْ يَخْرُجَ [meaning, accord. to what has been said<br>\
above, Zeyd is near to going forth, though generally otherwise expl., as will be shown in what<br>\
follows], and عَسَتْ فُلَانَةُ أَنْ تَخْرُجَ [Such a woman<br>\
is near to going forth]; زَيْدٌ being the agent of<br>\
عَسَى, and أَنْ يَخْرُجَ being its objective complement and meaning الخُرُوجَ: and one says also,<br>\
عَسَيْتُ أَنْ أَفْعَلَ ذَاكَ [as meaning, accord. to what<br>\
here precedes, I am near to doing that], and<br>\
عَسِيتُ, with kesr, agreeably with readings [in the<br>\
Kur xlvii. 24], فَهَلْ عَسِيتُمْ and عَسَيْتُمْ, with kesr<br>\
and fet-h; and one says to a woman, عَسَيْتِ أَنْ<br>\
تَفْعَلِى ذَاكَ; and [to women,] عَسَيْتُنَّ; but one<br>\
does not use the form يَفْعَلُ thereof, nor the form<br>\
فَاعِلٌ; (S;) both of which [however] are memtioned [as used] by the author of the “ Insáf: ”<br>\
(I &#39;Ak p. 88:) [or, accord. to Fei,] عَسَى is a preterite verb, [used in the sense of the present,]<br>\
aplastic, not perfectly inflected, of the verbs of<br>\
appropinquation, implying hope, and eager desire,<br>\
and sometimes opinion, and certainty; and it is<br>\
incomplete [i. e. non-attributive], and complete<br>\
[i. e. attributive]: the incomplete has for its predicate an aor. mansoob by means of أَنْ, as in the<br>\
saying, عَسَى زَيْدٌ أَنْ يَقُومَ, meaning قَارَبَ زَيْدٌ<br>\
القِيَامَ [Zeyd is near to standing], the predicate<br>\
being an objective complement or having the<br>\
meaning of an objective complement: or, as some<br>\
say, the meaning is لَعَلَّ زَيْدًا أَنْ يَقُومَ, i. e. [virtually, but not literally,] I eagerly desire, or I<br>\
hope, that Zeyd may be performing the act of<br>\
standing: [but see عَلَّ and لَعَلَّ in art. عل, as<br>\
well as what follows in this paragraph after the<br>\
explanation of the next ex.:] the complete is such<br>\
as occurs in the saying, عَسَى أَنْ يَقُومَ زَيْدٌ [meaning, accord. to what is said above, Zeyd&#39;s standing is near to being a fact]; the agent being<br>\
literally a phrase composed of a subject and an<br>\
attribute because أَنْ is here what is termed<br>\
مَصْدَرِيَّة [so that أَنْ يَقُومَ زَيْدٌ is equivalent to قِيَامُ<br>\
زَيْدٍ]: (Msb:) ―<br>\
-b2-  [in the MA and PS and TK<br>\
&amp;c., عَسَى is expl. as meaning It may be that;<br>\
and this, or simply may-be, or may-hap, or perhaps, I regard as the preferable rendering; as<br>\
being virtually the meaning in all cases: for<br>\
عَسَى زَيْدٌ أَنْ يَقُومَ, in which it is used as an incomplete verb, however it may be rendered, virtually means It may be that Zeyd is, or will be,<br>\
standing; or may-be Zeyd &amp;c.: and عَسَى أَنْ<br>\
يَقُومَ زَيْدٌ, in which it is used as a complete verb,<br>\
virtually means the same, though more properly<br>\
rendered Zeyd&#39;s standing may be a fact: its<br>\
usages are various, and have occasioned much<br>\
dispute respecting its grammatical character and<br>\
its meaning or meanings; as will be shown by<br>\
what here follows:] ―<br>\
-b3-  it is [said to be] a verb<br>\
unrestrictedly, or a particle unrestrictedly: (K:)<br>\
[but this statement seems to have originated from<br>\
a mistranscription: IHsh says,] it is a verb unrestrictedly: not a particle unrestrictedly, contrary to the opinion of Ibn-Ks-Sarráj and Th;<br>\
nor when it has an affixed pronoun, as in عَسَاكَ,<br>\
contrary to an opinion of Sb, ascribed to him by<br>\
Seer: (Mughnee:) it denotes hope in the case of<br>\
that which is liked, and fear in the case of that<br>\
which is disliked; as in the saying in the Kur<br>\
[ii. 213], وَعَسَى أَنْ تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَكُمْ وَعَسَى<br>\
أَنْ تُحِبُّوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَكُمْ [But it may be that ye<br>\
dislike a thing when it is good for you, and it may<br>\
be that ye like a thing when it is evil for you]:<br>\
(Mughnee, K: *) ―<br>\
-b4-  it is used in various ways;<br>\
one of which is the saying, عَسَى زَيْدٌ أَنْ يَقُومَ<br>\
[mentioned above], respecting the analysis of<br>\
which there are different opinions: that of the<br>\
generality is, that it is like كَانَ زَيْدٌ يَقُومُ [inasmuch as عسى is here an incomplete verb]; but<br>\
this is deemed dubious, because the predicate<br>\
[أَنْ يَقُومَ] is rendered by an inf. n., and the subject [زَيْدٌ] is a substance; to which several replies<br>\
have been made; one being that a prefixed noun<br>\
is meant to be understood, either before the subject, so that the meaning is, عَسَى أَمْرُ زَيْدٍ القِيَامُ<br>\
[It may be that the case of Zeyd is, or will be,<br>\
the performing of the act of standing], or before<br>\
the predicate, so that the meaning is عَسَى زَيْدٌ<br>\
صَاحِبُ القِيَامِ [It may be that Zeyd is, or will be,<br>\
the performer of the act of standing]; and another<br>\
reply is, that it is of the class of زَيْدٌ عَدْلٌ and<br>\
صَوْمٌ [meaning عَادِلٌ and صَائِمٌ, for أَنْ يَقُومَ is<br>\
equivalent to an inf. n., and an inf. n. may be<br>\
used in the sense of an act. part. n.]; and another<br>\
is, that أَنْ is here redundant, which reply is [said<br>\
to be] nought, because ان has rendered the aormansoob, and because it seldom falls out [from<br>\
the phrase, though it should be remarked that<br>\
لَعَلَّ, which is said in the Mughnee to be like<br>\
عَسَى in meaning, is generally followed by a<br>\
simple aor. and sometimes by أَنْ and an aor.]:<br>\
another opinion respecting the analysis of the<br>\
phrase is, that عَسَى is a trans. verb, like قَارَبَ in<br>\
meaning and in government, [agreeably with the<br>\
explanations mentioned above from the S and<br>\
Msb,] or intrans. like قَرُبَ مِنْ with the preposition suppressed; and this is the opinion of Sb and<br>\
Mbr: the opinion of the generality is, that it is<br>\
an incomplete verb [like كَانَ in the phrase كَانَ<br>\
زَيْدٌ يَقُومُ, mentioned above], and that أَنْ and<br>\
the verb following it compose a substitute of implication supplying what is wanting in the two preceding portions of the sentence: ―<br>\
-b5-  the second<br>\
way of using it is, the making it to have أَنْ and<br>\
the verb following this for its object, [as in<br>\
عَسَى أَنْ يَقُومَ زَيْدٌ, mentioned above], so that it<br>\
is a complete verb: ―<br>\
-b6-  the third and fourth and<br>\
fifth are when it is followed by a simple aor.<br>\
[being in this case likened to كَادَ, (S, K, * TA.)]<br>\
or an aor. with س prefixed, or a single noun; as<br>\
in عَسَى زَيْدٌ يَقُومُ [It may be that Zeyd stands, or<br>\
will stand] and عَسَى زَيْدٌ سَيَقُومُ [It may be that<br>\
Zeyd will stand] and عَسَى زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ [It may be<br>\
that Zeyd is standing]; the first whereof is one<br>\
of which there are few exs., such as the saying,<br>\
عَسَى الكَرْبُ الَّذِى أَمْسَيْتَ فِيهِ<br>\
يَكُونُ وَرَآءَهُ فَرَجٌ قَرِيبُ<br>\
[It may be that the state of anxiety in which thou<br>\
hast become (or, as some relate it, أَمْسَيْتُ i. e. I<br>\
hare become,) is such that after it will be a near<br>\
removal thereof]; and the third is one of which<br>\
there are fewer exs., [and which is said in the S<br>\
to be not allowable,] such as the saying,<br>\
أَكْثَرْتَ فِى العَذْلِ مُلِحًّا دَائِمَا<br>\
لَا تُكْثِرَنْ إِنِّى عَسِيتُ صَائِمَا<br>\
[or, as some relate it, عَسَيْتُ, which is more common, i. e. Thou hast been profuse in censuring,<br>\
persisting constantly: be not thou profuse: verily<br>\
it may be that I am, or shall be, abstaining];<br>\
and as to the prov., عَسَى الغُوَيْرُ أَبْؤُسًا [expl. in<br>\
art. بأس, and of which it is said in the K that the<br>\
verb therein is used in the manner of كَانَ, and<br>\
in the S that the phrase is extr., that ابؤسا is<br>\
there put in the place of the predicate, and that<br>\
there sometimes occurs in provs. what does not<br>\
occur elsewhere], the right opinion is that يَكُونُ<br>\
is suppressed before ابؤسا; and [in the latter of<br>\
the two verses cited above] أَكُونُ is suppressed<br>\
before صائما; because thus the primary usage is<br>\
preserved, and because what is hoped is the person&#39;s being an abstainer, not the abstainer him-<br>\
self; and as to the second of the three modes of<br>\
using عَسَى last mentioned above, with س prefixed to the aor., it is very extr.: ―<br>\
-b7-  the sixth<br>\
way of using it is the saying عَسَانِى and عَسَاكَ<br>\
and عَسَاهُ, which is rare: in this case, accord. to<br>\
Sb, it is used in the manner of لَعَلَّ, as governing<br>\
the subject in the accus. case, and the predicate<br>\
in the nom.; the predicate being sometimes expressed, in the nom. case, as in the saying,<br>\
فَقُلْتُ عَسَاهَا نَارُ كَأْسٍ وَعَلَّهَا<br>\
تَشَكَّى فَآتِى نَحْوَهَا فَأَعُودُهَا<br>\
[And I said, May-be it is the fire of Ka-s, (for I<br>\
suppose that كأس is here a proper name, that of<br>\
a woman, daughter of El-Kelhabeh El-&#39;Oranee,)<br>\
and perhaps she has a complaint, (تَشَكَّى being<br>\
for تَبَشَكَّى,) so I will come towards her, and visit<br>\
her]: ―<br>\
-b8-  the seventh way is the saying, عَسَى زَيْدٌ<br>\
قَائِمٌ, mentioned by Th; which is to be explained<br>\
on the ground that عسى is here an incomplete<br>\
verb, and that its subject is the ضَمِيرُ الشَّأْنِ [i. e.<br>\
إِنَّهُ is suppressed, the meaning being, It may be<br>\
that the case is this, Zeyd is standing], the nominal<br>\
proposition being the predicate. (Mughnee. [Several other statements in that work, respecting<br>\
عَسَى, I have omitted, as being refuted therein,<br>\
or as being of little or no importance.]) ―<br>\
-b9-  It<br>\
also denotes opinion, (Msb,) or doubt, (K, TA,)<br>\
and certainty: (Msb, K, TA:) the last is meant<br>\
in the saying of Ibn-Mukbil,<br>\
ظَنِّى بِهِمْ كَعَسَى وَهُمْ بِتَنُوفَةٍ<br>\
يَتَنَازَعُونَ جَوَائِزَ الأَمْثَالِ<br>\
[My opinion of them is like an expression of certainty while they, in a desert, or in a desert destitute of water or of herbage and water, &amp;c., are<br>\
contending in reciting current proverbs instead of<br>\
attending to the wants of themselves and their<br>\
camels]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  As uttered by God, it is<br>\
expressive of an event of necessary occurrence,<br>\
(S, K,) in the whole of the Kur-án, except the<br>\
saying, [in lxvi. 5,] عَسَى رَبُّهُ إِنْ طّلَّقَكُنَّ أَنْ يُبْدِلَهُ<br>\
أَزْوَاجًا خَيْرًا مِنْكُنَّ [It may be that his Lord, if<br>\
he divorce you, will give him in exchange wives<br>\
better than you]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b11-  هَلْ عَسَيْتُمْ with what<br>\
follows it, in the Kur [ii. 247], means [virtually]<br>\
Are ye near to fleeing? (K:) some read thus;<br>\
and some, عَسِيتُمْ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَسِىَ النَّبَاتُ [erroneously written in the CK عَسَى]: see the first<br>\
sentence in art. عسو.<br>\
4<br>\
أَعْسِ بِهِ means How well adapted or disposed,<br>\
or how apt, meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit, competent, or proper, or how worthy, is he! (Lh,<br>\
K, TA.)<br>\
بِالعَسَى أَنْ تَفْعَلَ means بِالحَرَى [i. e. It is suitable, fit, or proper, that thou shouldst do such a<br>\
thing]. (K. [In the CK, and likewise in the<br>\
TK, erroneously, بالعَسِىِّ and بالحَرِىِّ.])<br>\
-A2-  عَسًا:<br>\
see art. عسو.<br>\
هُوَ عَسٍ بِهِ: see what next follows.<br>\
هُوَ عَسِىٌّ بِهِ He is adapted or disposed by nature,<br>\
apt, meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit, competent,<br>\
proper, or worthy, for it or of it; as also ↓ عَسٍ<br>\
بِهِ: (K, TA:) but one should not say عَسًى. (TA.)<br>\
[See also مَعْسَاةٌ.]<br>\
عَاسٍ: see art. عسو.<br>\
مِعْسَآءٌ A girl thought to have attained puberty:<br>\
(Lh, TA:) or a girl near to attaining puberty. (K.)<br>\
مَعْسَاةٌ is from عَسَى, like مَئِنَّةٌ from إِنَّ: you<br>\
say, هُوَ مَعْسَاةٌ لِلْخَيْرِ, meaning He is a person<br>\
(مَحَلٌّ) [fit, or proper,] for one&#39;s saying of him,<br>\
عَسَى أَنْ يَفْعَلَ خَيْرًا [It may be that he will do<br>\
good]: (A and TA in art. ان:) and إِنَّهُ لَمَعْسَاةٌ<br>\
بِكَذَا, meaning مَخْلَقَةٌ [i. e. Verily he is adapted<br>\
or disposed by nature, apt, meet, suited, &amp;c., for<br>\
such a thing]: (K, TA:) and in like manner,<br>\
without variation, it is used in speaking of a<br>\
female, and of two persons, and of a pl. number.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُعْسِيَةٌ A she-camel of which one doubts whether<br>\
there be in her milk or not: (IAar, K, TA:) or<br>\
whose milk has stopped and it is hoped that it will<br>\
return. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
