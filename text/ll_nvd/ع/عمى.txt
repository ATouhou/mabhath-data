عَمِىَ, [aor. يَعْمَى,] inf. n. عَمًى, He was, or<br>\
became, blind, (S, Msb, K,) of both eyes; (Msb,<br>\
K, * TA;) as also ↓ اِعْمَاىَ, aor. يَعْمَايُ, inf. n.<br>\
اِعْمِيَآءٌ; (K;) [said by SM to be like اِرْعَوَى, aor.<br>\
يَرْعَوِى, inf. n. اِرْعِوَآءٌ; as though اِعْمَاىَ were originally اِعْمَىَّ, like as اِرْعَوَى is originally اِرْعَوَّ,<br>\
both being of the measure اِفْعلَّ; but he adds,<br>\
correctly, that,] accord. to Sgh, اِعْمَاىَ is originally<br>\
like اِدْهَامَمَ, which becomes اِدْهَامَّ, [i. e. it is<br>\
originally اِعْمَايَىَ,] but the latter ى is changed<br>\
into ا because of the fet-hah of the former, so that<br>\
it becomes اِعْمَايَا, and the two, thus differing, do<br>\
not easily admit of idghám (TA;) and sometimes the ى of اِعْمَاىَ is musheddedeh, (Sgh, K,<br>\
TA,) so that it becomes [↓ اِعْمَاىَّ, aor. يَعْمَاىُّ,<br>\
inf. n. اِعمِيَّآءٌ,] like اِدْهَامَّ, aor. يَدْهَامُّ, inf. n.<br>\
اِدْهِيمَامٌ; but this is by a straining of a point, and<br>\
not in use: (Sgh, TA:) and ↓ تعمّى, likewise,<br>\
signifies the same, (K, TA,) i. e., the same as<br>\
عَمِىَ. (TA.) And you say also, عَمِيَتْ عَيْنَاهُ His<br>\
two eyes were, or became, blind. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence<br>\
عَمًى is metaphorically used in relation to the<br>\
mind, as meaning (tropical:)  An erring; the connection<br>\
between the two meanings being the not finding,<br>\
or not taking, the right way: (Msb:) or the being<br>\
blind in respect of the mind: and in this sense,<br>\
the verb is as above, with the exception of the<br>\
measure اِفعَالَّ [and the abbreviated form of this].<br>\
(K, * TA. [اَفْعَالٍ in the CK in this passage is a<br>\
mistranscription, for افْعَالَّ.]) You say, عَمِىَ عَنْ<br>\
رُشْدِهِ, and حُجَّتِهِ, meaning لَمْ يَهْتَدِ (assumed tropical:)  [He did not,<br>\
or could not, become guided to his right course, and<br>\
his plea or the like; i. e. he was, or became, blind<br>\
thereto]. (TA.) And عَمِىَ عَنْ حَقِّهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He was,<br>\
or became, blind to his right, or due], like عَشِىَ<br>\
عَنْهُ. (TA in art. عشو.) ―<br>\
-b3-  One says also عَمِىَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ الخَبَرُ (tropical:)  The information was, or became,<br>\
unapparent, obscure, or covert, to him. (Mgh,<br>\
Msb. *) And عَمِىَ عَلَيْهِ طَرِيقُهُ, (TA,) and الأَمْرُ,<br>\
(S, TA,) and الشِّعْرُ, and الكَلَامُ, (Har p. 190,) i. e.<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [His way, or road, and the affair, and the<br>\
poetry, or verse, and the speech, or saying,] was,<br>\
or became, obscure, or dubious, to him; (S, TA,<br>\
and Har ubi suprá) and so ↓ عُمِّىَ; (TA;) and<br>\
↓ تعمّى. (Har ubi suprá.) Hence, accord. to<br>\
different readings, in the Kur [xxviii. 66], فَعَمِيَتْ<br>\
عَلَيْهِمُ الْأَنْبَآءُ and ↓ فَعُمِّيَتْ (assumed tropical:)  [And the pleas shall<br>\
be obscure, or dubious, to them]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
عَمِيتُ إِلَى كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  I betook myself to such a thing,<br>\
not desiring any other; as also عَطِشْتُ. (TA.<br>\
[Accord. to the TA, the inf. ns. of these two<br>\
verbs, thus used, are عميان and عطشان: but<br>\
they are correctly عَمًى and عَطَشٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  عَمَى<br>\
المَوْجُ, aor. يَعْمِى, (S, K,) inf. n. عَمْىٌ, (S,) The<br>\
waves cast the particles of rubbish, or the like, (S,<br>\
K, TA,) driving them to their upper, or uppermost, parts, (TA,) and the foam. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And عَمَى بِلُغَامِهِ, (K, TA,) aor. يَعْمِى, (TA,)<br>\
He (a camel) brayed, and cast the foam of his<br>\
mouth upon his head, or the upper part of his<br>\
head, or anywhere: (K, TA:) mentioned by ISd.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence] عَمَانِى بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He cast<br>\
upon me a suspicion of such a thing. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
عَمَى, aor. يَعْمِى, said of water, (K, TA,) and of<br>\
other things, (TA,) also signifies It flowed; (K,<br>\
TA;) and so هَمَى. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And عمى النَّبْتُ<br>\
[app. عَمَى] and ↓ اعتمى and اِعْتَمَّ are three syn.<br>\
dial. vars., (TA in this art.,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
plant, or herbage, became of its full height, and<br>\
blossomed; (S, K, TA, in explanation of the last,<br>\
in art. عم;) and became luxuriant, or abundant<br>\
and dense. (TA in that art.)<br>\
2<br>\
عمّاهُ, inf. n. تَعْمِيَةٌ, He rendered him blind,<br>\
of both eyes: (K, TA:) and (TA) so ↓ اعماهُ, (S,<br>\
Msb, TA,) said of God, (S, TA,) or of a man.<br>\
(Msb.) Hence the saying of Sá&#39;ideh Ibn-Jueiyeh,<br>\
وَعَمَّى عَلَيْهِ المَوْتُ بَابَىْ طَرِيقِهِ<br>\
[And death rendered blind, to him, the two doors<br>\
of his way]; بابى طريقه meaning his two eyes.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] عَمَّيْتُ الخَبَرَ (assumed tropical:)  I made the<br>\
information unapparent, obscure, or covert. (Msb.)<br>\
And عمّى مَعْنَى البَيْتِ, inf. n. as above, (S, K,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He made the meaning of the verse unapparent,<br>\
obscure, or covert. (K.) And عمّى مُرَادَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\

عمّى عَلَى إِنْسَانٍ شَيْئًا (assumed tropical:)  He made a thing obscure,<br>\
or dubious, to a man. (TA.) See also 1, latter<br>\

-b2-  Also He<br>\
found him to be blind [app. meaning properly,<br>\
and also (assumed tropical:)  in mind]. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  مَا أَعْمَاهُ means<br>\
only مَا أَعْمَى قَلْبَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [How blind is his mind!]:<br>\
(S, K:) for the verb of wonder is not formed<br>\
from that which is not significant of increase. (S.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعمّى [in its proper sense, and also in a tropical sense]: see 1, in two places.<br>\
6<br>\
تعامى He feigned himself أَعْمَى (S, K, TA)<br>\
[i. e. blind], in respect of the eyes [as is implied in<br>\
the S], ―<br>\
-b2-  and also (assumed tropical:)  in respect of the mind [as<br>\
is implied in the K]. (TA.) You say, تعامى<br>\
عَنْ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He feigned himself ignorant [of such<br>\
a thing], as though he did not see it; like تَعَاشَى<br>\
عَنْهُ. (TA in art. عشو.)<br>\

اِعْتَمَاهُ He chose it, selected it, or preferred it;<br>\
syn. اِخْتَارَهُ; (S, K, TA;) i. e., a thing; (S;)<br>\
formed by transposition from اِعْتَامَهُ [mentioned<br>\
in art. عيم]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. قَصَدَهُ [i. e.<br>\
He tended, betook himself, or directed himself or<br>\
his course or aim, to, or towards, him, or it;<br>\
&amp;c.]; (K, TA;) like اِعْتَامَهُ. (TA in art. عيم.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, last sentence.<br>\

and هَمَا. (TA.)<br>\
عَمًى [sometimes written عَمًا] inf. n. of عَمِىَ<br>\
[q. v.]. (S, * Msb, K.) [Hence the saying, لَا<br>\
شَلَلًا وَلَا عَمًى: see 1 in art. شل. Hence also one<br>\
says, رَكِبَ أَمْرًا عَلَى العَمَى, meaning He ventured<br>\
upon, or embarked in, an affair blindly; like عَلَى<br>\
غَيْرِ بَصِيرَةِ.]<br>\
-A2-  See also أَعْمَآءٌ.<br>\
-A3-  And see عَمَآءٌ,<br>\

(TA.)<br>\
-A5-  And Dust; syn. غُبَارٌ. (K.)<br>\
-A6-  In the<br>\
saying of a rájiz, describing a skin of milk, because of its whiteness,<br>\
يَحْسَبُهُ الجَاهِلُ مَا كَانَ عَمَا<br>\
شَيْخًا عَلَى كُرْسِيِّةِ مُعَمَّمَا<br>\
[The ignorant would think it, while there was<br>\
remoteness, to be an old man upon his chair, turbaned,] the meaning is looking at it from afar;<br>\
for العَمَا in this case signifies remoteness. (TA.)<br>\
عَمٍ, originally عَمِىٌ: see أَعْمَى, in four places.<br>\
عَمْيَةٌ, a contraction of عَمِيَةٌ fem. of عَمٍ: see<br>\

عِمْيَةٌ [in the CK erroneously عَمْيَة] a subst.<br>\
from اِعْتَمَاهُ in the sense of اِخْتَارَهُ [signifying A<br>\
thing chosen, selected, or preferred; like خِيرَةٌ,<br>\
a subst. from اِخْتَارَهُ]. (K, TA.)<br>\
عَمَوِىٌّ Of, or relating to, such as is termed عَمٍ<br>\
[q. v. voce أَعْمَى]. (S, TA.)<br>\
عَمَآءٌ, (S, K, TA,) in some of the copies of the<br>\
K ↓ عَمًى, and by some thus related in a trad.<br>\
mentioned in what follows, (TA,) Clouds: or,<br>\
accord. to AZ, [clouds] resembling smoke, surmounting the heads of mountains: (S, Msb:) or<br>\
lofty clouds: or [in the CK “ and ”] dense: (K,<br>\
TA:) or dense [clouds such as are termed] غَيْم:<br>\
(TA:) or raining clouds: or thin clouds: or<br>\
black: or white: or such as have poured forth<br>\
their water; (K, TA;) but have not become dissundered like mountains: and ↓ عَمَآءَةٌ [is the n. un.,<br>\
and] signifies a dense, covering, cloud; as also<br>\
↓ عَمَايَةٌ: or a dense portion of cloud: but some<br>\
disallow this, and make عَمَآءٌ to be [only] a coll. n.<br>\
(TA.) It is related in a trad. that, in reply to<br>\
the question “ Where was our Lord (meaning<br>\
the عَرْش [q. v.] of our Lord) before He created<br>\
his creatures? ” it was said, كَانَ فِى عَمَآءٍ تَحْتَهُ<br>\
هَوَآءٌ وَفَوْقَهُ هَوَآءٌ [He (i. e. his عَرْش) was in clouds,<br>\
or lofty clouds, &amp;c., beneath which was a vacuity,<br>\
and above which was a vacuity]: or, accord. to<br>\
one relation, ↓ كَانَ فِى عَمًى [meaning He was<br>\
in a vacuity] i. e. there was not with Him anything: or, as some say, it means anything that<br>\
the intellectual faculties cannot perceive, and to<br>\
the definition of which the describer cannot attain.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also عَمَآءَةٌ.<br>\
أَتَيْتُهُ صَكَّةَ عُمَىٍّ, (S,) or لَقِيتهُ صَكَّةَ عُمَىٍّ, and<br>\
↓ عُمْىٍ, which occurs in poetry, (K, TA,) in a<br>\
case in which the metre requires it, a verse of<br>\
Ru-beh, who uses it for عَمَىٍّ, (TA, [which<br>\
shows, by citing that verse, that عَمًى, the reading in the CK, is wrong,]) and ↓ أَعْمَى, (K,) i. e.<br>\
[I came to him, or I met him,] in the time of<br>\
midday when the heat was vehement, (S,) or in<br>\
the most vehement heat of midday in summer (K,<br>\
and Lh and O and TA in art. صك) when the heat<br>\
almost blinded by its vehemence; (Lh and O and<br>\
TA in that art.;) a time in which the divinelyappointed prayer [of midday] is forbidden: it is<br>\
said only in the hot season; because when a man<br>\
goes forth at that time, he cannot fill his eyes<br>\
with the light of the sun; or, as ISd says, because the gazelle seeks the covert when the heat<br>\
is vehement, and his eye becomes weak by reason<br>\
of the whiteness of the sun, and the bright shining<br>\
thereof, and he is dazzled, so that he knocks<br>\
against his covert, not seeing it: (TA:) عُمَىّ<br>\
being an abbreviated dim. of أَعْمَى: (S:) or it is<br>\
a name for the heat, (K, TA,) itself: (TA:) or<br>\
the name of a certain man, (K, TA,) of [the tribe<br>\
of] &#39;Adwán, who used to press forward with the<br>\
pilgrims when the heat was vehement, as is related in the Nh, or (TA) who used to decide<br>\
cases judicially in, or concerning, the pilgrimage,<br>\
and he came among a company journeying upon<br>\
their camels, (K, TA,) performing the religious<br>\
visit called عُمْرَة, (TA,) and they alighted at a<br>\
station in a hot day, whereupon he said, “Upon<br>\
whomsoever shall come this hour, or time, of tomorrow while he is حَرَام [i. e. in the condition of<br>\
one performing the acts of the حَجّ or of the عُمْرَة],<br>\
(K, TA,) not having accomplished his عُمْرَة, (TA,)<br>\
he shall remain حَرَام until [this time] next year: ”<br>\
and they immediately sprang up, (K, TA,) hastening, (TA,) so that they arrived at the House<br>\
[of God, at Mekkeh, in the time required,] from<br>\
a distance of a journey of two nights, using exertion; (K, TA;) and this saying became a prov.,<br>\
as is related in the M: (TA:) or it was the name<br>\
of a certain man, (S, K, TA,) of the Amalekites,<br>\
(S, TA,) who made a sudden attack upon a people, and exterminated them; (S, K, TA;) and<br>\
the time became called in relation to him. (S,<br>\

or futile: (TA:) [or the last but one, or the<br>\
last, signifies (assumed tropical:)  ignorance; for] ↓ فِيهِمْ عَمِيَّتُهُمْ or<br>\
↓ عُمِيَّتُهُمْ (accord. to different copies of the S)<br>\
means In them is their ignorance. (S.) [See<br>\
also عِمِّيَّةٌ, and عِمِّيَّا.] ―<br>\
-b2-  For the first (عَمَآءَةٌ), see<br>\
also عَمَآءٌ.<br>\
عَمَايَةٌ A remaining portion of the darkness of<br>\
night. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And Dimness of the eyes from<br>\
tears: so, accord. to Freytag, in the Deewán of<br>\
the Hudhalees.] ―<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  Trial, or probation; punishment; slaughter;<br>\
civil war; conflict and faction, or sedition; &amp;c.].<br>\
(Mz, 40th نوع.) [See also the next paragraph.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [In the TA, عمياء, evidently a mistranscription<br>\
for عِمِّيَّا, is expl. as having the second of the<br>\
meanings assigned above to عَمَآءَةٌ &amp;c., i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Persistence; or contention, &amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b3-  قَتِيلُ عِمِّيَّا, (Mz<br>\
ubi suprà, and K,) [in the CK, erroneously, عَمِيَّا,<br>\
and in the TA قُتِلَ عِمِّيَّا,] the latter word of the<br>\
measure فِعِّيلَى, (Mz, TA,) like رِمِّيَّا, (K, TA, [in<br>\
the CK like رَمِيَّا,]) and خِصِّيصَى, (TA,) means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A slain person whose slayer is not known. (Mz,<br>\
K, TA.) The predicament of him who has been<br>\

عِمِّيَّةٌ and عُمِّيَّةٌ, (K, TA,) of the measure فُعِّيلَةٌ<br>\
from العَمَى, (TA,) Pride; or self-magnification:<br>\

slain under a banner of pride, &amp;c.,] i. e. in فِتْنَة<br>\
[meaning conflict and faction, or the like], or<br>\

عَامٍ One who does not see his road, or way.<br>\

-b2-  عَامِيَةٌ, applied to a land (أَرْضٌ): see<br>\
أَعْمَى. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, [thus applied,] Of which the<br>\
traces are becoming [or become] effaced, or obliterated. (TA.) ―<br>\

of عَامٍ; (K, TA, but not in the CK;) and the<br>\
dual of its fem. is عَمْيَاوَانِ; and its pl. is عَمْيَاوَاتٌ:<br>\
(TA:) the fem. of ↓ عَمٍ is عَمِيَةٌ, (S, K, TA, [in<br>\
the CK عَمِيَّةٌ, which is a mistranscription, for it<br>\
is]) of the measure فَعِلَةٌ, (S,) like فَرِحَةٌ, (TA,)<br>\
and ↓ عَمْيَةٌ, (K, TA, but not in the CK,) which<br>\
is [a contraction] like فَخْذٌ for فَخِذٌ: (TA:) and<br>\
the pl. masc. is عَمُونَ. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Blind in respect of the mind: (K, TA:) [but<br>\
more commonly] one says, ↓ هُوَ عَمٍ as meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  He is erring, or one who errs; and أَعْمَى القَلْبِ<br>\
[meaning the same, or blind in respect of the<br>\

عَمِيَةُ القَلْبِ [like عَمِى القَلْبِ as applied to a man].<br>\
(S.) In the saying in the Kur [xvii. 74], وَمَنْ<br>\
كَانَ فِى هٰذِهِ فَهُوَ فِى الْآخِرَةِ أَعْمَى, accord.<br>\
to Er-Rághib, the former [اعمى] is a part. n.<br>\
and the second is like it; (TA;) and the meaning<br>\
is, And whoso is in this state of existence blind in<br>\
respect of the mind, not seeing his right course, he<br>\
will be in the other blind with respect to the way of<br>\
safety: (Bd:) or, as some say, the second is<br>\
what is termed أَفْعَلُ تَفْضِيلٍ, the complement of<br>\
which is expressed by means of مِنْ, [meaning<br>\
more blind &amp;c.,] and therefore AA and Yaakoob<br>\
did not pronounce it with الإِمَالَة, as not being<br>\
like the first, (Bd, TA, *) which is subject to<br>\
الامالة because its ا [written ى] becomes [really]<br>\
ى in the dual: but Hamzeh and Ks and Aboo-Bekr pronounced both with الامالة. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
الأَعْمَيَانِ means (assumed tropical:)  The torrent and the fire of a<br>\
burning house or the like; (K, TA;) because of<br>\
the perplexity that befalls him whom they befall;<br>\

place, nor avoid anything; like the أَعْمَى [or<br>\
blind], who knows not where he is travelling, so<br>\
that he goes whither his leg conveys him: (TA:)<br>\
or the torrent and the night: (K:) or the torrent,<br>\
(S, K) or the tumultuous torrent, (TA,) and the<br>\
camel excited by lust. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And الأَمْرُ<br>\
الأَعْمَى (assumed tropical:)  The case [such as that] of partisanship<br>\

أَعْمَآءٌ Tracts of land in which is no sign of the<br>\
way, (S, K,) nor any habitation or cultivation,<br>\
(K,) or nor any trace of habitation or cultivation;<br>\
(S;) and ↓ مَعَامٍ signifies the same; (S, K;) this<br>\
latter being a pl. of which the sing., said by ISd<br>\
to be unknown to him, should by rule be معمية<br>\
[app. مُعْمِيَةٌ], but it is ↓ عُمَّى, deviating from<br>\
rule; (TA;) or it means مَجَاهِلُ, and its sing.<br>\
is معماة [i. e. ↓ مَعْمَاةٌ] signifying a place of erring,<br>\
or wandering from the right way: (Har p. 85:)<br>\
in the K, أَعْمَآءٌ is also expl. as signifying جُهَّالٌ<br>\
[pl. of جَاهِلٌ], and is said to be [in this sense] pl.<br>\
of أَعْمَى: but this is a double mistake, for it signifies مَجَاهِلُ, [like as مَعَامٍ is said to do above,]<br>\
and its sing. is عمى [app. ↓ عَمًى]. (TA.) In<br>\
the phrase ↓ أَعْمَآءُ عَامِيَةٌ, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
عامِيَّةٌ,] the latter word is added to give intensiveness to the meaning; i. e., it signifies [Tracts in<br>\
which is no sign of the way, &amp;c.,] in the utmost<br>\
degree obscure or dubious: thus it is in the following verse: (TA:) Ru-beh says,<br>\
أَعْمَاؤُهُ ↓ وَبَلَدٍ عَامِيَةٍ<br>\
كَأَنَّ لَوْنَ أَرْضِهِ سَمَاؤُهُ<br>\
[And many a desert, or waterless desert, whereof the<br>\
tracts in which is no sign of the way are in the utmost degree obscure or dubious, as though the colour<br>\
of its ground were like that of its sky]: (S, TA:) he<br>\
means وَرُبَّ بَلَدٍ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Tall; applied to<br>\
men: (IAar, K:) pl. of ↓ عَامٍ, like as أَنْصَارٌ is of<br>\
نَاصِرٌ. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
أَعْمَوِىٌّ Of, or relating to, such as is termed<br>\
أَعْمَى [q. v.]. (S, TA.)<br>\
مَعْمَاةٌ; and the pl. مَعَامٍ: see أَعْمَآءٌ.<br>\
مُعَمًّى (assumed tropical:)  A verse [or a saying] of which the<br>\
meaning is made unapparent, obscure, or covert.<br>\
