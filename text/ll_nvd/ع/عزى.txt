expl. by some as meaning Such as does not constrain himself to be patient [with the patience of<br>\

إِعْتَزَىَ see art. عزو; to which, as well as to the<br>\
present art., this verb belongs. الاِعْتِزَآءُ [often]<br>\
signifies الاِ دِّعَآءُ وَالشِّعَارُ فِى الحَرْبِ [i. e. The<br>\
asserting one&#39;s relationship by saying “ I am such<br>\
a one the son of such a one; ” and the call, or cry,<br>\
by means of which to know one another; in war:<br>\
see 8 (last sentence but one) in art. دعو; and see<br>\
also شِعَارٌ]. (K in this art.)<br>\
عَزٍ Patient, or enduring; or having comely<br>\
patience. (K.)<br>\
عِزَةٌ, held by some to belong to this art.: see<br>\
art. عزو.<br>\
عِزْيَةٌ: see عَزَآءٌ in art. عزو.<br>\
عَزَآءٌ Patience, or endurance; (S, K;) and عِزْوَةٌ<br>\
signifies the same, as in the saying هُوَ حَسَنُ العِزْوَةِ<br>\
[He is comely in respect of patience or endurance]:<br>\
(Ham p. 369:) or patient endurance of the loss of<br>\
anything: (TA:) or comely patience or endurance;<br>\
(K, TA;) as also تَعْزُوَةٌ accord. to the copies of<br>\
the K, but correctly ↓ تَعْزِيَةٌ [inf. n. of 2, as<br>\
though for تَعْزِيَةُ النَّفْسِ i. e. self-enjoinment, or<br>\
self-exhortation, to be patient or enduring, as is<br>\
indicated by what follows]: an Arab of the<br>\
desert, whose brother had slain a son of his, is<br>\
cited by the author of the Hamáseh as saying,<br>\
[on his brother&#39;s being brought to him that he<br>\
might retaliate upon him, (see Ham p. 100,)]<br>\
أَقُولُ لِلنَّفْسِ تأْسَآءًا وَتَعْزِيَةً<br>\
إِحْدَى يَدَىَّ أَصَابَتْنِى وَلَمْ تُرِدِ<br>\
[I say to the soul, i. e. to myself, enjoining patience<br>\
and enjoining endurance, One of my two hands<br>\
has smitten me, not desiring, or not meaning, to<br>\
do so]: (TA:) تَأْسَآءٌ is [syn. with تَأْسِيَةٌ, inf. n. of<br>\
أَسَّى,] from الإِسْوَةُ: and التَّعْزِيَةُ [signifies as rendered above; or] is derived from العَزَازُ, i. e. “ the<br>\
hard ground,” and means the strengthening of the<br>\
heart: or it is from عَزَوْتُهُ إِلَى أَبِيهِ; because the<br>\
afflicted remembers his ancestors who have gone<br>\
before him; and he means, I enjoin the soul to<br>\
endure his loss with patience, becoming consoled<br>\
by the example of others whose sons have been<br>\
slain. (Ham ubi suprà.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَزَآءٌ is also a quasiinf. n.; like عَطَآءٌ, meaning إِعْطَآءٌ, from أَعْطَى:<br>\
(TA:) or a subst. [signifying Enjoinment, or<br>\
exhortation, to be patient: and hence, consolation: and, as often used in the present day, the<br>\
state, or ceremony, of mourning, when relations<br>\
and friends come to console the bereaved:] from<br>\
عَزَّيْتُهُ; like سَلَامٌ from سَلَّمٌ, and كَلَامٌ from كَلَّمَ.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  See also art. عزو.<br>\
