عَطِبَ, (S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
عَطَبَ, (A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. عَطَبٌ, (S, * Mgh, * O, *<br>\
Msb,) and مَعْطَبٌ also may be an inf. n. of the<br>\
same, (Har p. 196,) He perished, or died: (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, K:) [Freytag mentions عَطَبَ also<br>\
in the same sense, as from the K, in which I do<br>\
not find it:] it is said of a man, and of other than<br>\
man: in a trad. it is said of seed-produce. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And He (a camel, and a horse,) flagged, or<br>\
became powerless: (K, TA:) or stopped with his<br>\
master [or rider] from fatigue. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
عَطِبَ عَلَيْهِ He was, or became, violently, (O,) or<br>\
most violently, (K,) angry with him. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
العَطْبُ signifies لِينُ القُطْنِ (O, * K) and الصُّوفِ,<br>\
(O,) and نُعُومَتُهُ: (K:) you say, عَطَبَ, aor.<br>\
عَطُبَ,<br>\
(A, O, K,) inf. n. عَطْبٌ and عُطُوبٌ, (O,) It [i. e.<br>\
cotton, and wool,] was, or became, soft. (A, O, *<br>\
K. [See also عُطْبٌ, below.])<br>\
2<br>\
تَعْطِيبٌ, (O, K,) inf. n. of عطّب, (TA,) signifies The brewing (عِلَاج) of beverage, or wine,<br>\
in order that its odour may become good: (O, K:)<br>\
so says Aboo-Sa&#39;eed. (O.) The phrase رَحِيق<br>\
مُعَطَّب occurs in a poem of Lebeed, as some<br>\
relate it; but as others relate it, it is مُقَطَّب,<br>\
which means “ mixed: ” (O, TA:) so says Az;<br>\
and he adds, “I know not what مُعَطَّب is. ”<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, in a grape-vine, The appearing<br>\
of the knots, or gems, in the places whence grow<br>\
the bunches of grapes. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اعطبهُ He (a man, Msb), or it (calamity, A),<br>\
destroyed him, or caused him to perish. (S, A, O,<br>\
Msb, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
اعتطب النَّارَ He took fire in a portion of<br>\
cotton: (A:) or اعتطب بِعُطْبَةٍ he took fire in a<br>\
piece of rag (O, K) or a portion of cotton. (O.)<br>\
عُطْبٌ and ↓ عُطُبٌ Cotton: (IAar, S, O, K:)<br>\
and ↓ عُطْبَةٌ signifies a portion thereof, (S, A, O,<br>\
TA,) or of wool. (TA.) [SM says,] In the T,<br>\
العطب is said to mean لين القُطْنِ وَالصُّوفِ, [and<br>\
so in the O, where it is written العَطْبُ, and said<br>\
to be with fet-h,] and its n. un. is عطبة; but I<br>\
have found it written with damm [to the ع];<br>\
therefore by لين seems to be meant لَيِّن [i. e.<br>\
Such as is soft of cotton and of wool: which<br>\
I think to be evidently a mistake: see 1].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عَطِبٌ [Perishing, or dying]: see an ex., from<br>\
a poet, voce رُبَّ.<br>\
عُطُبٌ: see عُطْبٌ.<br>\
عُطْبَةٌ: see عُطْبٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A portion of rag by<br>\
means of which fire is taken: (K:) or a portion<br>\
of burning cotton (S, A, O) or rag: (S, O:) so<br>\
in the saying, أَجِدُ رِيحَ عُطْبَةٍ [I perceive the<br>\
odour of a portion of burning cotton or rag].<br>\
(S, A, O.)<br>\
عَوْطَبٌ A calamity, or misfortune: (As, O, K:)<br>\
from العَطَبُ [inf. n. of عَطِبَ]. (As, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And The main part, or fathomless deep, of the<br>\
sea: (As, K:) likewise from العَطَبُ: (As, TA:)<br>\
and so عَوْبَطٌ, (K in art. عبط,) formed by transposition: (TA ibid.:) or the deepest place in the<br>\
sea: (IAar, O:) or a depressed part between two<br>\
waves. (IAar, O, K.)<br>\
أَعْطَبُ More [and most] soft: so in the saying,<br>\
هٰذَا الكَبْشُ أَعْطَبُ مِنْ هٰذَا [This ram is more soft<br>\
in his wool than this]. (O.)<br>\
مَعْطَبٌ A place of perdition or destruction:<br>\
pl. مَعَاطِبُ. (S, O, Msb.) [See also 1, first<br>\
sentence.]<br>\
