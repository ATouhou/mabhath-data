عَطَا, [aor. يَعْطُو,] inf. n. عَطْوٌ: see 6, first<br>\
quarter, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence] one says<br>\
طَوِيلٌ لَا تَعْطُوهُ الأَيَادِى [High, so that the hands<br>\
will not reach it]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَطْوٌ signifies<br>\
also The act of raising the head and the hands<br>\
(K, TA) to take a thing. (TA.) See also an ex.<br>\
in a verse cited voce أَنْ, p. 106, first col. [And<br>\
see عَطْوٌ, and عَاطٍ.]<br>\
-A2-  تَعَاطَيْنَا فَعَطَوْتُهُ: see 6.<br>\
2<br>\
هُوَ يُعَطِّينِى, (S, K, TA,) with teshdeed, (S,<br>\
TA,) thus in the M, as well as the S, erroneously<br>\
written in [some of] the copies of the K يُعْطِينِى,<br>\
(TA,) He serves me, does service for me, or<br>\
ministers to me; as also ↓ يُعَاطِينِى. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
You say, مَنْ يُعَطِّيكَ i. e. Who has the office of<br>\
serving thee? (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And عَطَّيْتُهُ I incited<br>\
him, or made him, to hasten, or be quick.<br>\
(Sgh, K.)<br>\
3<br>\
عَاْطَوَ see 4, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also 2. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
عَاطَى الصَّبِىُّ أَهْلَهُ means The boy wrought for his<br>\
family, and gave them, or handed to them, what<br>\
they desired. (ISd, Z, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And المُعَاطَاةُ<br>\
signifies A man&#39;s meeting, face to face, a man<br>\
having with him a sword, and saying, “Bring<br>\
near thy sword,” and he gives it, and thereupon<br>\
each acts with the other awhile in a manner resembling the slaying with the edge of the sword<br>\
(يَغُرُّهُ [see غَرَّ فُلَانٌ فُلَانًا]); they being in a marketplace or a mosque: the doing of which is forbidden. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  عَاطَيْتُ الأَرْطَالَ means [I<br>\
joined in mutually, or reciprocally, giving, or presenting, the pints of wine; i. e.] أَعْطَيْتُ النَّدَامَى<br>\
وَأَعْطَوْنِى أَرْطَالَ الخَمْرِ [I gave, or presented to, the<br>\
cup-companions, and they gave, or presented to, me,<br>\
the pints of wine]. (Har p. 650.)<br>\
4<br>\
إِعْطَآءٌ, (K, MF, TA,) and ↓ مُعَاطَاةٌ (S, Msb,<br>\
K) and عِطَآءٌ, (K,) The act of giving, presenting,<br>\
or offering; or giving with the hand in the way<br>\
of presenting or offering; syn. مُنَاوَلَةٌ (S, Msb, K,<br>\
MF, TA) عَلَى جِهَةِ التَّقْرِيبِ; and إِعْطَآءٌ has been<br>\
expl. as syn. with إِيتآءٌ; but several authors make<br>\
a distinction between these two words, saying<br>\
that the latter is sometimes obligatory and sometimes by way of favour, whereas the former is<br>\
never but by way of sheer favour; as El-Fakhr<br>\
Er-Rázee says; though most of the leading lexicologists know not this distinction. (MF, TA.)<br>\
One says, أَعْطَاهُ الشَّىْءَ; and إِيَّاهُ ↓ عَاطَاهُ, inf. n.<br>\
مُعَاطَاةٌ and عِطَآءٌ; He gave him, &amp;c., the thing.<br>\
(TA.) And اعطاهُ مَالًا [He gave him, &amp;c., property]. (S.) And أَعْطَيْتُهُ دِرْهَمًا I gave him, &amp;c.,<br>\
a dirhem. (Msb.) And as the signification of<br>\
this verb does not depend upon the condition of<br>\
taking, or receiving, but only upon giving, or delivering, one may say, أَعْطَيْتُهُ فَمَا أَخَذَ [I gave,<br>\
or delivered, &amp;c., to him, and he did not take, or<br>\
receive]. (Msb.) [See also a verse cited in the<br>\
first paragraph of art. رأم, in which this verb has<br>\
a single objective complement with بِ redundantly prefixed to it.] ―<br>\
-b2-  اعطى, (S,) inf. n. as<br>\
above, (K,) signifies also (tropical:)  He was, or became,<br>\
tractable, manageable, or submissive; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
said of a camel: (S:) and اعطى بِيَدِهِ [lit. he<br>\
gave his hand, said of a man,] signifies the same:<br>\
accord. to Er-Rághib, اعطى, said of a camel,<br>\
primarily signifies he gave his head, and did not<br>\
resist. (TA.) [Hence,] one says to a tractable<br>\
camel, when his haltering becomes loosed (lit.<br>\
opened) from his muzzle, أَعْطِ [meaning Give thy<br>\
head]; whereupon he bends his head towards<br>\
his rider, and he renews his haltering. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
مَا أَعْطَاهُ لِلْمَالِ [How large a giver is he of property!] is like the phrase مَا أَوْلَاهُ لِلْمَعْرُوفِ, and<br>\
مَا أَكْرَمَهُ لِى; anomalous, because the verb of<br>\
wonder is not formed from the measure أَفْعَلَ,<br>\
and only what has been heard, of this kind, from<br>\
the Arabs, is allowable. (S, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعطّى: see 10.<br>\
-A2-  And see also 6, last<br>\
quarter, in two places.<br>\
-A3-  Also He hastened, or<br>\
made haste. (Sgh, K.)<br>\

given, presented, or offered, or that is as though<br>\
it presented, or offered, itself], or taking with the<br>\
hand; as also ↓ عَطْوٌ; syn. of both تَنَاوُلٌ. (K.)<br>\
One says, تعاطاهُ He took it, or took it with his<br>\
hand; syn. تَنَاوَلَهُ: (S:) and هُوَ يَتَعَاطَى كَذَا He<br>\

and الشَّىْءَ ↓ عَطَوْتُ I took the thing with the hand;<br>\
syn. تَنَاوَلْتُهُ بِالْيَدِ: (S:) or الشَّىْءَ ↓ عَطَا, and إِلَيْهِ<br>\

with the hand, one from another, and contended<br>\
together in doing it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And The contending in giving, presenting, or offering.] One<br>\
says also, ↓ تَعَاطَيْنَا فَعَطَوْتُهُ, (S, K, TA,) aor.<br>\
أَعْطُوهُ, (TA,) i. e. [We contended in giving, and it<br>\
may also mean in taking, and] I overcame, or<br>\
surpassed, him [therein]. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [And<br>\
simply The giving, presenting, or offering, mutually, reciprocally, or by one to another. See an<br>\
ex. voce شَبَرٌ. ―<br>\
-b6-  And hence, The reciting, one<br>\
with another, or the vying, one with another, in<br>\
reciting, verses, or poetry.] One says تَعَاطَوُا<br>\
الرَّجَزَ بَيْنَهُمْ (TA and TK in art. رجز) (assumed tropical:)  They recited, one with another, [or they vied, one with<br>\
another, in reciting,] verses, or poetry, of the<br>\

art.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And The standing upon the extremities<br>\
of the toes, with raising the hands to a thing. (K.)<br>\
And hence, (K, TA,) as some say, (TA,) فَتَعَاطَى<br>\
فَعَقَرَ, (K, TA,) in the Kur [liv. 29]: (TA:) for<br>\
this is said to mean And he stood upon the extremities of his toes, then raised his hands, and<br>\
smote her: (S, TA:) or this means and he took<br>\
the sword, (Ksh, Bd, Jel,) or the she-camel,<br>\
(Ksh,) and slew her: (Ksh, Bd, Jel:) or and he<br>\
emboldened himself &amp;c.: (Ksh, Bd:) [for] ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
تَعَاطٍ signifies also The being bold, daring, or<br>\
courageous, so as to attempt, or venture upon, a<br>\
thing without consideration or hesitation: (TA:)<br>\
or, as also ↓ تَعَطٍّ, the venturing upon, or embarking in, or doing, (K, TA,) a thing, or an affair,<br>\
(K,) or a bad, or foul, thing or affair: (TA:)<br>\
or the former is used in relation to that which is<br>\
noble, or honourable; and ↓ the latter, in relation<br>\

one enters into such a thing: (S:) or ventures<br>\

or the drinking thereof; and gaming: you say,<br>\
تعاطى الخَمْرَ; and المَيْسِرَ: see Ksh and Bd and<br>\

[as an &#39;Atawee, meaning] much in quantity:<br>\
originating from the fact that a man of the Benoo-<br>\

عَطَاآنِ and عَطَاوَانِ: (S, TA:) it is used as a<br>\
quasi-inf. n. in the saying,<br>\

pl. of ↓ عَطِيَّةٌ is عَطَايَا: (S, Mgh, Msb:) and عَطَآءٌ<br>\

عَطَآءٌ also signifies [A soldier&#39;s stipend, or pay; or<br>\

عَاطٍ A gazelle raising his head to take the leaves<br>\

هَلْ أَنْتَ مُعْطِيَّهُ [lit. Art thou my giver of it?],<br>\
with fet-h and teshdeed to the ى: and in like<br>\
manner thou sayest to a pl. number, هَلْ أَنْتُمْ<br>\
مُعْطِيَّهُ, because the ن [of the word مُعْطُونَ] falls<br>\
out by reason of the word&#39;s becoming a prefixed<br>\
noun, and the و is changed into ى and incorporated [into the pronominal ى], and the ى is pronounced with fet-h because [originally] preceded<br>\
by a quiescent letter [i. e. the و which is changed<br>\
into ى]: and to two persons thou sayest, هَلْ<br>\
أَنْتُمَا مُعْطِيَايَهُ, with fet-h to the ى: and thus you<br>\
