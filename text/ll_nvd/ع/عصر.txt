عَصَرَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
عَصِرَ, (O, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. عَصْرٌ; (S, Msb;) and ↓ اعتصرهُ; (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K;) [He pressed it, or squeezed it, so as to<br>\
force out, i. e. he expressed, its juice, sirup, honey,<br>\
oil, water, or moisture;] he extracted, or fetched<br>\
out by labour or art [i. e. by pressure or wringing],<br>\
(Msb, K,) its water, or juice, or the like, (Msb,)<br>\
or what was in it, (K,) namely, what was in<br>\
grapes, (S, Msb, K,) and the like, (Msb, K,) of<br>\
things having oil, or sirup, or honey: (TA:) or<br>\
عَصَرَهُ signifies he performed that act himself;<br>\
(K;) as also ↓ عصّرهُ, inf. n. تَعْصِيرٌ: (Sgh, TA:)<br>\
or the latter, he superintended the pressing thereof,<br>\
i. e., of grapes: (O:) and ↓ اعتصرهُ, he had it<br>\
done for him: (K:) or this last, he did it for<br>\
another, or others: (Mgh, as implied by an<br>\
explanation of مُعْتَصِرٌ:) and عَصِيرًا ↓ اعتصر he<br>\
prepared expressed juice or the like. (S, O.) [See<br>\
also 8 below.] عُصْرَ is used as a contraction of<br>\
عُصِرَ. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] عَصَرَ الثَّوْبَ, inf. n. as<br>\
above, He wrung out the water of the garment,<br>\
or piece of cloth; he forced out its water by<br>\
wringing it. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَصَرَ الدُّمَّلَ لِتَخْرُجَ<br>\
مِدَّتُهُ [He squeezed, or pressed, the pustule in order<br>\
that its thick purulent matter might come forth].<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَصَرَ حَلْقَهُ [He squeezed his<br>\
throat]. (Mgh and Msb in art. خنق.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
عَصَرَ, aor.<br>\
عَصِرَ, (assumed tropical:)  He took, or collected, the produce<br>\
of the earth: from the same verb in the first of<br>\
the senses expl. above: and hence, accord. to Abu-l-Ghowth, in the Kur [xii. 49], وَفَيهِ يَعْصِرُونَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  And in it they shall take, or collect, the produce<br>\
of the earth: (S:) or the meaning is, and in it<br>\
they shall press grapes, or olives, or the like: or<br>\
they shall milk the udders. (Bd.) [And there<br>\
are other explanations, which see below.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
عُصِرُوا, (S, IKtt, O,) or ↓ أُعْصِرُوا, (O, K,) They<br>\
were rained upon; they had rain; syn. مُطِرُوا,<br>\
(S, O,) or أُمْطِرُوا [which is less correct]. (IKtt,<br>\
K.) Hence, in the Kur [ubi suprà], accord. to<br>\
one reading, وَفِيهِ يُعْصَرُونَ [And in it they shall<br>\
have rain]. (S, O.) [See also above, and below.]<br>\
-A3-  عَصَرَهُ also signifies He saved him; preserved<br>\
him: and hence, in the Kur [ubi suprà], accord.<br>\
to one reading, وَفِيهِ يُعْصَرُونَ [And in it they shall<br>\
be saved, or preserved]. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence also,<br>\
perhaps, the other reading, وَفِيهِ يُعْصِرُونَ And in<br>\
it they shall aid, or succour, one another. (Bd.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  See also 8, last quarter, in two places.<br>\
-A4-<br>\
Also, عَصَرَهُ, (O, TA,) inf. n. عَصْرٌ, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
It [or he] withheld, hindered, or prevented, him:<br>\
(O, K, * TA:) one says, مَا عَصَرَكَ What withheld,<br>\
hindered, or prevented, thee? (O, TA.) And He<br>\
refused, and withheld, it; (K, * TA;) namely,<br>\
anything. (TA.) [See also 8, which signifies<br>\
the same.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَصَرَهُ, (K,) aor.<br>\
عَصِرَ, inf. n. عَصْرٌ,<br>\
He gave (O, K, TA) to him. (K, TA.) Thus<br>\
it has two contr. significations. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\
Tarafeh says,<br>\
لَوْ كَانَ فِى أَمْلَاكِنَا أَحَدٌ<br>\
يَعْصِرُ فِينَا كَالَّذِى تَعْصِرُ<br>\
(S, O, TA, but in the S with مَلِكٌ in the place of<br>\
أَحَدٌ,) i. e. [If there were, or would that there<br>\
were, among our kings one] giving to us the like<br>\
of what thou givest: (TA:) and another reading<br>\
is, مِثْلَ مَا تَعْصِرُ; (O;) and it is expl. (by A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
TA) as meaning, doing to us benefits (O, TA)<br>\
like as thou dost: (O:) but Aboo-Sa&#39;eed relates<br>\
it thus;<br>\
يُعْصَرُ فِينَا كالَّذِى تُعْصَرُ<br>\
i. e. يُصَابُ مِنْهُ [app. from عَصَرَ signifying “ he<br>\
pressed ” grapes and the like; and thus meaning,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  from whom is gotten, among us, like what is<br>\
gotten from thee; or, as it may be less freely<br>\
rendered, who has his bounty drawn forth, among<br>\
us, like as thou hast thine drawn forth]; and he<br>\
disallowed the reading [يَعْصِرُ and] تَعْصِرُ. (TA.)<br>\

عَصَّرَ see 1:<br>\
-A2-  and see also 4, second sentence.<br>\
-A3-  عصّر الزَّرْعُ, inf. n. تَعْصِيرٌ; (K, TA;) but in the<br>\
Tekmileh written الزَّرْعُ ↓ عَصَرَ, without teshdeed;<br>\
(TA;) The corn put forth its glumes: (K, TA:)<br>\
app. from عَصَرٌ meaning “ a place of protection: ”<br>\
i. e. [the rudiments of its ears] became protected<br>\
in its glumes. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
عاصر فُلَانًا, inf. n. مُعَاصَرَةٌ and عِصَارٌ, He was<br>\
contemporary with such a one: or he attained to,<br>\
or reached, the time of such a one. (O, TA.)<br>\
Hence the saying, المُعَاصَرَةُ مُعَاسَرَةٌ وَالمُعَاصِرُ<br>\
لَا يُنَاصِرُ [The being contemporary is an occasion<br>\
of hard, or harsh, treatment; and the contemporary will not render reciprocal aid to his<br>\
fellow]. (TA. [But I have substituted معاسرة<br>\
for معاصرة, which latter seems to have been<br>\
written by mistake for the former.])<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also 8, last quarter.<br>\

اعصر He (a man, TA) entered upon the time<br>\
called العَصْر: (K, TA:) and also he entered upon<br>\

(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And اعصرت, (S, Msb, K,) and ↓ عصّرت,<br>\
(K,) so in all the copies of the K, but in a copy<br>\
of the Tahdheeb of IKtt ↓ عَصَرَتْ, without tesh-deed, (TA,) (tropical:)  She (a girl, S, Msb, or woman, K)<br>\
attained the عَصْر of her youth, (TA,) or [simply]<br>\
attained the period of her youth, (K,) and arrived<br>\
at the age of puberty: (K, TA:) or entered upon<br>\
the time of puberty, and began to have the menstrual discharge; (S, O;) because of her womb&#39;s<br>\
being pressed; (O;) or as though she entered<br>\
upon the عَصْر of her youth: (S, O, TA:) or she<br>\
attained the age of puberty: (S, IKtt:) or she<br>\
had the menstrual discharge: (Msb:) or she<br>\
entered upon the time of that discharge: (K:) or<br>\
she approached that time; for, said of a girl, it<br>\
is like رَاهَقَ said of a boy; accord. to Abu-lGhowth el-Aarábee: (S:) or she approached the<br>\
age of twenty: (K:) or she became confined in<br>\
the house, (K,) and had a retreat (عَصَرٌ) appointed<br>\
for her, (TA,) at the time of her having the menstrual discharge: (K:) or she brought forth;<br>\

of having rain pressed forth from them by the<br>\
winds. (O, and Bd in lxxviii. 14. [But see<br>\

-A3-  اعصرت الرِّيحُ,<br>\
(O, TA,) and ↓ عَصَرَت, (TA,) The wind brought<br>\
what is termed إِعْصَار [q. v. infrà.]. (O, TA.)<br>\
And you say also, الرِّيحُ بِالتُّرَابِ فِى الهَوَآءِ ↓ عَصَرَتِ<br>\

-b2-  You say also,<br>\
انعصر الخِنَاقُ فِى حَلْقِهِ [The strangling-rope, or<br>\
the like, became compressed upon his throat].<br>\
(TA in art. خنق.)<br>\
8<br>\
اعتصرهُ: see عَصَرَهُ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence, app.,] اعتصر (tropical:)  He voided his ordure.<br>\
(O, K, * TA.) [See the act. part. n., below.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And اعتصر بِالمَآءِ (assumed tropical:)  He swallowed the water by<br>\
little and little in order that some food by which he<br>\
was choked might be made to descend easily in his<br>\
throat. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And اعتصر مَالَهُ (tropical:)  He extracted, or extorted, his property from his hand,<br>\
or possession: (S, Msb, TA:) from the same verb<br>\
as syn. with عَصَرَ expl. in the beginning of this<br>\
art.: (Msb:) he took forth his property for a<br>\
debt or for some other reason: (K, * TA:) and<br>\
اعتصر, (assumed tropical:)  he took; (K;) as also ↓ عَصَرَ, aor.<br>\
عَصِرَ:<br>\

to El-&#39;Itreefee, (assumed tropical:)  he took the property of his son<br>\

do not say اعتصر فُلَانٌ مَالَ فُلَانٍ [such a one took<br>\
for himself the property of such a one] unless he<br>\
be a relation to him: [you say so of a father:] and<br>\
of a boy you say, اعتصر مَالَ أَبِيهِ, meaning, (assumed tropical:)  he<br>\
took the property of his father. (TA.) [See<br>\
اعتسر.] And بِالمَالِ ↓ اعتصر العَصَّارُ [or المَالَ?<br>\

the property]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also اعتصر, (tropical:)  He<br>\
took back a gift: (A, Mgh, L, TA:) in the K,<br>\
the inf. n. is expl. by اِنْتِجَاعُ العَطِيَّةِ; but in the<br>\
L, the verb is expl. by اِرْتَجَعَ العَطِيَّةَ, [and in like<br>\
manner in the A and Mgh,] and رَجَعَ فِيهَا:<br>\
(TA:) (assumed tropical:)  he revoked, recalled, or retracted, the<br>\
gift; syn. اِرْتَجَعَ, (Mgh, O,) and اِسْتَرَدَّ. (Mgh.)<br>\
Hence the trad. of &#39;Omar, الوَالِدُ يَعْتَصِرُ وَلَدَهُ فِيمَا<br>\
أَعْطَاهُ وَلَيْسَ لِلْوَلَدِ أَنْ يَعْتَصِرَ مِنْ وَالِدِهِ, i. e., (tropical:)  The<br>\
father may take from his child what he has given<br>\
him; [but it is not for the child to take from his<br>\
father what he has given him.] (Mgh, O.) But<br>\

وَلَدِهِ فِى مَالِهِ [(tropical:)  The father may take back what<br>\
he has given to his child], the verb is made trans.<br>\
by means of على because it implies the meaning<br>\
of يَرْجِعُ عَلَيْهِ, and يَعُودُ عَلَيْهِ: (IAth, Mgh, O: *)<br>\
or this latter trad. means, the father may forbid<br>\
his child his property, and withhold it from him:<br>\
(S:) and [in like manner] the former trad., the<br>\
father may withhold his child from giving his<br>\
property, and forbid it to him: (TA:) for اعتصر<br>\
also signifies he prevented, hindered, withheld, or<br>\
refused; syn. مَنَعَ. (K, TA.) Hence, اِعْتِصَارُ<br>\
الصَّدَقَةِ [The withholding, or refusing, the poorrate]. (TA.) [See also 1.] ―<br>\
-b6-  اعتصر also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He was niggardly, or avaricious, (K, TA,)<br>\
عَلَيْهِ towards him. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اعتصر بِهِ; (S, A,<br>\
K;) and به ↓ تعصّر, (S, K,) or إِلَيْهِ; (O;) and<br>\

(tropical:)  He had recourse to him for refuge, protection,<br>\
or preservation; (S, A, K;) and sought, desired,<br>\
or asked, aid, or succour, of him. (A.) In the<br>\
Kur [xii. 49], ↓ وَفِيهِ تُعْصَرُونَ [sic], which is one<br>\
reading, is expl. by Lth as signifying And in it ye<br>\
shall have recourse for refuge, or protection;<br>\
but Az disapproves of this: (TA:) [the common reading] وفيه يَعْصِرُونَ, accord. to AO, (so<br>\
in one copy of the S,) or A&#39;Obeyd, (as in another<br>\
copy of the S,) signifies and in it they shall be<br>\
safe; from عُصْرَةٌ signifying “ a cause, or means,<br>\
of safety: ” (S:) or they shall be safe from trial, or<br>\
affliction, and shall preserve themselves by plenty,<br>\
or fruitfulness. (TA.)<br>\

↓ عُصُرٌ (S, A, O, Msb, K) and ↓ عُصْرٌ (S, A, O,<br>\
K) and ↓ عِصْرٌ (A, O, K) i. q. دَهْرٌ [as meaning<br>\
Time; or a time; or a space or period of time];<br>\
(S, A, O, Msb, K;) or any unlimited extent of<br>\
time, during which peoples pass away and become<br>\
extinct; (Esh-Shiháb, in the “ Sharh esh-Shifè; ”)<br>\
[a succession of ages:] such is said by Fr to be<br>\
its meaning in the Kur ciii. l: (TA:) pl. (of<br>\
pauc., O) أَعْصُرٌ (O, K) and أَعْصَارٌ; (K;) and [of<br>\
mult.] عُصُورٌ (S, O, K) and عُصُرٌ. (K.) You say,<br>\
مَا فَعَلْتُهُ عَصْرًا, and بِعَصْرٍ, I did it not in its time.<br>\
(A.) And ↓ جَآءُ لٰكِنَّ لَمْ يَجِئْ لِعُصْرٍ He came,<br>\
but he came not at the [proper] time of coming.<br>\
(AZ, O, K: but AZ relates it without لكنّ. TA.)<br>\
And ↓ نَامَ وَمَا نَامَ لِعُصْرٍ, (K,) or, accord. to AZ<br>\
and Sgh and the author of the L and others, ما<br>\
↓ نام عُصْرًا, (TA,) He slept, but hardly, or scarcely,<br>\

and بِعَصْرٍ, Such a one slept, but slept not during a<br>\
[considerable period of] time, or day; (A;)<br>\
agreeably with other significations, here following. (TA.) ―<br>\

time, (سَاعَةٌ,) of the day. (Katádeh, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A<br>\
day: (K:) [or day, as opposed to night:] and a<br>\
night: (K:) [or night, as opposed to day:] also<br>\
the morning, before, or after, sunrise; syn. غَدَاةٌ:<br>\
and the afternoon; or evening; or last part of<br>\
the day; until the sun becomes red; as also ↓ عَصَرٌ,<br>\
(IDrd, K.) Hence, العَصْرَانِ The night and the<br>\
day: (O, TA:) or night and day: (Msb:) and the<br>\
morning, before, or after, sunrise, and the afternoon<br>\
or evening; or the first part of the day and the last<br>\
part thereof: الغَدَاةُ وَالعَشِىُّ. (ISk, S, O, Msb.)<br>\
[See also الأَبْرَدَانِ.] A poet says,<br>\
وَأَمْطُلُهُ العَصْرَيْنِ حَتَّى يَمَلُّنِى<br>\
وَيَرْضَى بِنِصْفِ الدَّيْنِ وَالأَنْفُ رَاغِمُ<br>\
[And I put him off, delaying the payment of his<br>\
debt, morning and evening, or from morning to<br>\
evening, so that he loathes me, and is content with<br>\
half of the debt, though unwilling]: meaning,<br>\
when he comes to me in the first part of the day,<br>\
I promise to pay him in the last part of it: (ISk,<br>\
S:) or, accord. to Sgh, the right reading (instead of<br>\
والانف راغم) is فِى غَيْرِ نَائِلِ [without liberality]:<br>\
and the verse is by &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr<br>\
El-Asadee. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Hence also (S, O) صَلَاةُ<br>\
العَصْرِ, (S, O, Msb,) and ↓ صلاة العَصَرِ, (O, TA,)<br>\
fem. only, and simply العَصْرُ, [and ↓ العَصَرُ,] mase.<br>\
and fem., (Msb,) [The prayer of afternoon; the<br>\
time of which commences about mid-time between noon and nightfall; or accord. to the Shá-<br>\
fi&#39;ees, Málikees, and Hambelees, when the shade<br>\
of an object, cast by the sun, is equal to the length<br>\
of that object, added to the length of the shade<br>\
which the same object casts at noon; and accord.<br>\
to the Hanafees, when the shadow is equal to<br>\
twice the length of the object added to the length<br>\
of its mid-day shadow: its end being sunset, or<br>\
the time when the sun becomes red:] so called<br>\
because performed in one of the عَصْرَانِ, i. e., in<br>\
the last portion of the day: (O:) also called<br>\

(Abu-l-&#39;Abbás:) pl. [of pauc.] أَعْصُرٌ; and [of<br>\
mult.] عُصُورٌ. (Msb.) [And hence likewise,]<br>\
العَصْرَانِ is applied in a trad. to The prayer of daybreak and that of the عَصْر; one being made predominant over the other; (Msb, TA;) as is the<br>\
case in القَمَرَانِ applied to the sun and the moon;<br>\
(TA;) or they are so called because they are<br>\
performed at the two extremities of the عَصْرَانِ,<br>\
meaning the night and the day; (Msb, TA;)<br>\
but the former is the more likely. (TA.) [See<br>\
an ex. of the dim., العُصَيْرُ, voce مُرْهِقَة, in art. رهق.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  You say also, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ عَصْرًا, meaning Such<br>\
