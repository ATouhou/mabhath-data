عَقَرَهُ, (S, Mgh, O, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
عَقِرَ, (Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) inf. n. عَقْرٌ, (S, * Mgh, O, Msb, K,) He<br>\
wounded him; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) [and so,<br>\
app., accord. to the K, ↓ عقّرهُ, inf. n. تَعْقِيرٌ; or<br>\
the latter signifies he wounded him much; for it<br>\
is said that] تَعْقِيرٌ signifies more than عَقْرٌ: (S,<br>\
O:) you say of a lion, and of a lynx, and of a<br>\
leopard, and of a wolf, يَعْقِرُ النَّاسَ [He wounds<br>\
men]. (Az, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَقَرَهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,<br>\
&amp;c.,) and عَقَرَهَا, (L, Mgh, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
عَقِرَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
عَقْرٌ; (Mgh, &amp;c.;) and ↓ عقّرهُ, (K,) and عقّرها,<br>\
(L,) inf. n. تَعْقِيرٌ; (TA;) [or the latter has an<br>\
intensive signification, or applies to many objects;<br>\
see above;] He hocked, houghed, or hamstrung,<br>\
(عَرْقَبَ,) him, or her, namely, a beast; (TA;) he<br>\
laid bare his [or her] (namely, a camel&#39;s) عُرْقُوب<br>\
[or hock-tendon]; such being the meaning of عقر<br>\
with the Arabs; (Az, TA;) he struck, (S, IAth,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) or cut, (TA,) his, (a camel&#39;s, S,<br>\
IAth, O, Msb, or a horse&#39;s, S, O, or a sheep&#39;s<br>\
or goat&#39;s, IAth,) or her, (a camel&#39;s, L, Mgh,)<br>\
legs, بِالسَّيْفِ with the sword, (S, IAth, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, TA,) while the beast was standing; (IAth;)<br>\
he cut one of his, or her, (a camel&#39;s,) legs, previously to stabbing the animal, that it might not<br>\
run away when being stabbed, but might fall<br>\
down, and so be within his power; he moved<br>\
[his or] her (a camel&#39;s) legs with the sword;<br>\
(IKtt, TA;) he made a mark, or wound, like a<br>\
notch, in his, or her, (a horse&#39;s, or a camel&#39;s,)<br>\
legs. (K.) [See عَقْرٌ, below.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence (Az,<br>\
TA,) عَقَرَهُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, He stabbed<br>\
him, namely, a camel; slaughtered him by stabbing: (Az, Msb, TA:) because the slaughterer<br>\
of the camel first lays bare its عَرْقُوب [or hocktendon; or hocks it; or strikes or cuts its legs,<br>\
or one of its legs, with a sword: see above].<br>\
(Az, TA.) So in the saying of Imra-el-Keys,<br>\
وَيَوْمَ عَقَرْتُ لِلْعَذَارَى مَطِيَّتِى<br>\
[And the day when I slaughtered for the virgins<br>\
my riding-camel]. (TA.) And so in the trad. لَا<br>\
عَقْرَ فِى الإِسْلَامِ [There shall be no slaughtering of<br>\
camels at the grave in the time of El-Islám]: for<br>\
they used to slaughter camels at the graves of the<br>\
dead, saying, The occupant of the grave used to<br>\
slaughter camels for guests in the days of his<br>\
life; so we recompense him by doing the like<br>\
after his death. (IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Hence also, He<br>\
slew him; he destroyed him: of this signification<br>\
we have an ex. in the story of Umm-Zara: وَعَقْرَ<br>\
جَارَتِهَا And [a cause of] the destruction of her<br>\
fellow-wife through [the latter&#39;s] envy [of her]<br>\
and rage [against her]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  حَلْقَى ↓ عَقْرَى,<br>\
(Mgh, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) said of a woman, (TA,)<br>\
occurring in a trad. of Safeeyeh, (Mgh, Msb, TA,)<br>\
in which Mohammad is related to have used this<br>\
expression, on the day of the return of the pilgrims from Minè, when he was told that she had<br>\
her menstrual flux, to which he added, “I see<br>\
her not to be aught but a hinderer of us; ” thus<br>\
accord. to the relaters of traditions, each word<br>\
being an inf. n., like دَعْوَى; (O, * TA;) of the<br>\
measure فَعْلَى; or, as some say, the ى is to<br>\
mark a pause; (Mgh;) and عَقْرًا حَلْقًا, (O, K,)<br>\
which are also inf. ns.; (TA;) and this is accord.<br>\
to the usage of the Arabs; (Az, TA;) being a<br>\
form of imprecation, though not meant to express<br>\
a desire for its having effect, (Az, Msb, TA,) for<br>\
what is meant by it is only blame; (Msb;) expl.<br>\
by وَعَقَرَهَا اللّٰهُ تَعَالَى وَحَلَقَهَا, (K,) i. e., [May God<br>\
(exalted be He) wound her, &amp;c., and] shave her<br>\
hair, or afflict her with a pain in her throat:<br>\
(TA:) or may her body be wounded (عُقِرَ), and<br>\
may she be afflicted with a disease in her throat:<br>\
(Mgh, O: *) so accord. to A&#39;Obeyd: or may her<br>\
leg and her throat be cut: or may her leg be cut<br>\
and her head shaven: (Mgh:) [or may she be<br>\
destroyed, and may her throat be cut:] or the<br>\
two words عقرى and حلقى are epithets, applied<br>\
to a woman of ill luck; and the meaning is, (Z,<br>\
O, TA,) she is one who extirpates [or destroys,<br>\
and cuts the throats of,] her people, by the effect<br>\
of her ill luck upon them; (Z, O, K, * TA;) being virtually in the nom. case, as enunciatives;<br>\
i. e., وَحَلْقَى ↓ هِىَ عَقْرَى. (Z, TA.) Lh mentions<br>\
the phrase, ↓ لَا تَفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ أُمُّكَ عَقْرَى [app. meaning, Do thou not that: may thy mother be childless: (see عَقُرَت:)] without explaining it: but he<br>\
mentions it with the phrases أُمُّكَ ثَاكِلٌ and أُمُّكَ<br>\
هَابِلٌ. (TA.) Or ↓ عَقْرَى signifies Having the<br>\
menstrual flux. (K.) One says also, imprecating<br>\
a curse upon a man, جَدْعًا لَهُ وَعَقْرًا وَحَلْقًا, meaning, May God [maim him, and] wound (عَقَرَ) his<br>\
body, and afflict him with a pain in his throat:<br>\
and sometimes, حَلْقَى ↓ عَقْرَى, without tenween.<br>\
(S.) [See also 1 in art. حلق.] ―<br>\
-b6-  عَقَرَبِهِ He killed<br>\
the beast which he was riding, and made him to<br>\
go on foot: he hocked, houghed, or hamstrung, his<br>\
beast. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Hence, عَقَرْتَ بِى Thou hast<br>\
long detained me, or restrained me; as though<br>\
thou hadst hocked (عَقَرْتَ) my camel and I were<br>\
therefore unable to journey: ISk cites as an ex.<br>\
قَدْ عَقَرَتْ بِالْقَوْمِ أُمُّ خَزْرَجِ<br>\
[Umm-Khazraj has long detained the party, or<br>\
people]. (S, O, TA.) And in the A it is said<br>\
that عَقَرَتْ فُلَانَةُ بِالرَّكْبِ means Such a woman,<br>\
or girl, came forth to the riders on camels, and<br>\
they staid long in her presence; as though she<br>\
hocked (عَقَرَت) the camels upon which they rode.<br>\
(TA.) One says also قَدْ كَانَتْ لِى حَاجَةٌ فَعَقَرَنِى<br>\
عَنْهَا I had a want, and he withheld me from it,<br>\
and hindered me. (Ibn-Buzurj, L.) Hence, عَقْرُ<br>\
النَّوَى, (Az, TA,) meaning صَرْفُهَا حَالًا بَعْدَ حَالٍ<br>\
[i. e. The shifting about of the course of a journey<br>\
by successive changes: see صَرْفٌ, third sentence].<br>\
(O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And عَقَرَ بِالصَّيْدِ i. q. وَقَعَ بِهِ [app.<br>\
meaning He made much slaughter among the<br>\
objects of the chase]. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And عَقَرَتْ بِهِمْ<br>\
She (a woman) smote their souls, and wounded<br>\
their hearts. (O.) ―<br>\
-b10-  عَقَرَ النَّخْلَةَ, (inf. n. عَقْرٌ,<br>\
TA, and subst. [or quasi-inf. n., like جَدَادٌ and<br>\
صَرَامٌ and قَطَافٌ &amp;c.,] ↓ عَقَارٌ, T, S, O, TA,) He<br>\
cut off the head of the palm-tree, (T, S, O, K,)<br>\
altogether, with the heart (الجُمَّار), (T, S, O,)<br>\
so that it dried up, (K,) and nothing came forth<br>\
from its trunk. (IKtt.) ―<br>\
-b11-  لَا تَعْقِرَنَّ شَجَرًا Thou<br>\
shalt by no means cut down trees. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b12-  عَقَرَ<br>\
المَرْعَى He cut down the trees of the pasture-land:<br>\
he cut down the herbage, or pasture, and spoiled<br>\
it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b13-  عَقَرَ الكَلَأَ He ate the herbage, or<br>\
pasture. (O, K.) And He had the herbage for<br>\
pasturage. (O.) ―<br>\
-b14-  You say of wine, يَعْقِرُ العَقْلَ<br>\
[It disables the intellect; like as a man disables a<br>\
beast by hocking him]. (IAar.) ―<br>\
-b15-  عَقَرَهُ, (S, O,<br>\
TA,) aor.<br>\
عَقِرَ, (TA,) inf. n. عَقْرٌ, (S, O, TA,) He<br>\
(a man) galled his (a camel&#39;s) back: (TA:) he<br>\
galled it; namely, a camel&#39;s back: (S, O:) it (a<br>\
camel&#39;s saddle, TA, and a horse&#39;s saddle, S, O,<br>\
TA) galled his (the beast&#39;s) back. (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b16-<br>\
And عُقِرَتْ رَكِيَّتُهُمْ Their well was demolished.<br>\
(O.)<br>\
-A2-  عَقِرَ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
عَقَرَ, (K,) inf. n. عَقَرٌ, (S,<br>\
O,) His (a man&#39;s) legs betrayed him, so that he<br>\
was unable to fight, by reason of fright and<br>\
stupefaction: (S, O:) he became stupified, or deprived of his reason: (S, K:) or he was taken by<br>\
sudden fright, (K, TA,) and stupified, or deprived<br>\
of his reason, (TA,) so that he could not advance<br>\
nor retire. (K, TA.) عَقِرْتُ حَتَّى خَرَرْتُ إِلَى الأَرْضِ<br>\
[My legs betrayed me, &amp;c., so that I fell to the<br>\
earth] was said by &#39;Omar. (S.) And one says,<br>\
عَقِرْتُ حَتَّى مَا أَقْدِرُ عَلَى الكَلَامِ [I am stupified,<br>\
or taken by sudden fright, &amp;c., so that I am not<br>\
able to talk]. (M, TA.) [And عَقِرَ alone means<br>\
He became unable to speak. In one place in the<br>\
L, this verb is written عُقِرَ; but this is probably<br>\
a mistake.]<br>\
-A3-  عَقُرَتْ, aor.<br>\
عَقُرَ; (S, IJ, M, IKtt,<br>\
L, Msb;) in the K, عُقِرَتْ, of the class of عُنِىَ;<br>\
but the authorities indicated above show that<br>\
عَقُرَتْ is the correct form; (TA;) and عَقَرَتْ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَقِرَ; (M, IKtt, L, Msb, K;) and عَقِرَتْ, aor.<br>\
عَقَرَ;<br>\
(M, IKtt, L;) inf. n. عُقْرٌ, (S, M, IKtt, L, Msb,<br>\
K,) of the first, (S, Msb, like as حُسْنٌ is inf. n.<br>\
of حَسُنَتْ, (S,) or of the second, (M, L, K,) and<br>\
عَقَارَةٌ (M, L, K) and عُقَارَةٌ, (K,) or عِقَارَةٌ, (M and<br>\
L, as in the TA,) which are of the first, (M, L,<br>\
K,) and عَقْرٌ, (M, IKtt, L, Msb, K,) which is of<br>\
the second, (M, L, Msb, K,) and عَقَارٌ, or عُقَارٌ,<br>\
(accord. to different copies of the K,) or عِقَارٌ, (M<br>\
and L, as in the TA,) also of the second, (K,)<br>\
or of the third; (M, L;) She (a woman [and a<br>\
camel &amp;c.]) was, or became, barren: (K, TA:)<br>\
or did not conceive: (S:) or ceased to conceive.<br>\
(IKtt, Msb.) ―<br>\

عَقِرَ: and عَقِرَ, aor.<br>\
عَقَرَ; He<br>\
(a man [and a beast]) was barren; did not generate. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عَقُرَ, aor.<br>\
عَقُرَ, inf. n. عُقْرٌ, (assumed tropical:)  It (an<br>\
affair) did not produce any issue, or result. (K.)<br>\
-A4-  عَقَرَهَا He (God) made her [to be barren, or]<br>\
to cease to conceive. (Msb.)<br>\
2<br>\
عقّرهُ: see 1, first and second sentences. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
جَدَّعْتُهُ وَعَقَّرْتُهُ I said to him جَدْعًا لَكَ وَعَقْرًا. (Sb.)<br>\
[See 1.]<br>\
3<br>\
عاقرهُ He contended with him for superior<br>\
glory (K, TA) and generosity and excellence (TA)<br>\
in the hocking, or slaughtering, (عَقْر [see 1],) of<br>\
camels. (K, TA.) It was customary for two<br>\
men thus to contend for superior munificence,<br>\
[giving away the flesh of the victims,] but they<br>\
did so for the sake of display and vain glory;<br>\
wherefore the eating of the flesh of camels<br>\
slaughtered on an occasion of this kind is forbidden in a trad., and they are likened to animals<br>\
sacrificed to that which is not God. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And عاقرهُ, (TK,) inf. n. مُعَاقَرَةٌ, (S, K,) He held<br>\
a dialogue or colloquy, or a disputation or debate,<br>\
with him, (S, K,) and encountered him with mutual<br>\
reviling and satire (S, TA) and cursing. (TA.)<br>\

or it, kept, confined himself or itself, clave, clung,<br>\
or held fast, to him, or it: (S, O, K: *) he kept,<br>\
or applied himself, constantly, or perseveringly, to<br>\
him, or it. (TA.) You say عاقر الخَمْرَ, (S, * TA,)<br>\
and simply عاقر, (TA,) He kept, or applied himself, constantly, or perseveringly, to the drinking<br>\
of wine: (S, TA:) or مُعَاقَرَةُ الشَّرَابِ signifies the<br>\
contending with wine for superiority; as when a<br>\
man says, I have more, or most, strength for<br>\
drinking, and so contending with it for superiority, and being overcome thereby. (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, TA.) You say also, عَاقَرَتِ الخَمْرُ الدَّنَّ<br>\
The wine remained long confined to the [jar<br>\
called] دَنّ; syn. لَازَمَتْهُ. (S, K.) And عاقرت<br>\
الخَمْرُ العَقْلَ [app., The wine took hold upon the<br>\
intellect: or contended with it for superiority]. (S.)<br>\
4<br>\
اعقرهُ He stupified him [so that his legs betrayed him and he was unable to fight or to<br>\
advance or retire: see عَقِرَ]. (S, O.)<br>\

TA;) God affected her womb mith a disease<br>\
(K, TA) so that she did not conceive. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
اعقر فُلَانًا He assigned to such a one a grant of<br>\
land; syn. أَطْعَمَهُ عُقْرَةً i. e. طُعْمَةً. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
one says, أَعْقَرْتُكَ كَلَأَ مَوْضِعِ كَذَا I have given<br>\
thee permission to pasture thy beasts upon the<br>\
herbage of such a place. (O.)<br>\
-A4-  And اعقر He<br>\
became possessed of much property such as is<br>\
termed عَقَار. (S, IKtt, O.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَعَاقَرَا, (K,) or تعاقرا إِبِلَهُمَا, (S, O,) They<br>\
two hocked, or hamstrung, their camels, (عَرْقَبَا<br>\
إِبِلَهُمَا, S, O, or عَقَرَاهَا, K,) vying, each with the<br>\
other, therein, (S, O,) that it might be seen which<br>\
of them should do so most. (K.) [See 3.]<br>\
7<br>\
انعقر He (a camel, and a horse, [&amp;c.,])<br>\
[became hocked, houghed, or hamstrung; had his<br>\
hock-tendon laid bare;] had his legs struck [or<br>\
cut] with a sword. (S.) [See 1.] ―<br>\
-b2-  It (a camel&#39;s<br>\
or a horse&#39;s back) became galled by the saddle;<br>\
as also ↓ اعتقر. (S, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِعْتَقَرَ see what next precedes.<br>\
عَقْرٌ The act of wounding; &amp;c.: [see 1:] a<br>\
mark, or wound, (أَثَرٌ,) like a notch, (كالحَزِّ, K,<br>\
TA, [in the CK, كالخَرِّ,]) in the legs of a horse,<br>\
and of a camel. (K.) [Hence, عَقْرًا حَلْقًا, and<br>\
عَقْرَى حَلْقَى: see 1.]<br>\
-A2-  See also عُقْرٌ, first sentence:<br>\
-A3-  and again in the last quarter.<br>\
-A4-  Also<br>\
What is, or constitutes, the most essential part, of<br>\
anything; or the prime, or the principal part,<br>\
thereof; syn. أَصْلٌ: [such appears to me to be<br>\
the meaning of اصل as here used, from what follows.] (S, IF, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The principal part (أَصْل)<br>\
of a دَار [i. e., a country]; (As, S, Msb, K;)<br>\
which is the place where the people dwell, or<br>\
abide; (As, S;) as also ↓ عُقْرٌ: (As, S, Msb, K:)<br>\
the former of the dial. of Nejd; (As, TA;) and<br>\
the latter of the dial. of the people of El-Medeeneh, (As, S,) or of the dial. of El-Hijáz; (TA;)<br>\
or both of the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz;<br>\
and the latter, in the dial. of others, signifies the<br>\
chief, or main, part of a دار; (Msb;) and the<br>\
latter also signifies the middle [or heart] of a دار:<br>\
(K:) or عَقْرُ الدَّارِ and ↓ عُقْرُهَا both signify the<br>\
principal part (اصل) of the place of abode of a<br>\
people, upon which they rest their confidence.<br>\
(Mgh, O.) This last signification is exemplified<br>\
by the trad. of &#39;Alee, مَا غُزِىَ قَوْمٌ فِى عَقْرِ دَارِهِمْ إِلَّا<br>\
ذَلُّوا [No people have had war waged against them<br>\
in the principal part of their country, upon which<br>\
they rest their confidence, but they have become<br>\
abased, or brought into subjection]: (Mgh,<br>\
O:) or the meaning here is, in the midst [or<br>\
heart] of their country, &amp;c.; i. e., in the place<br>\
where they abide, or lodge. (L.) It is said in<br>\
another trad., عَقْرُ دَارِ الْإِسْلَامِ الشَّأْمُ, meaning,<br>\
The principal part (اصل), and the place, of the<br>\
country of El-Islám is Syria: apparently pointing to a time of conflicts and factions, or seditions, when Syria should be free from them, and<br>\
the Muslims should there be more secure. (TA.)<br>\
Lth has confounded in explaining what is the<br>\
عُقْر of a دار and what is the عُقْر of a tank or<br>\
trough for watering beasts &amp;c. (Az.)<br>\
عُقْرٌ (S, M, &amp;c.) and ↓ عَقْرٌ, (M,) or ↓ عَقْرَةٌ<br>\
and ↓ عُقْرَةٌ, (A, K,) Barrenness, in a woman, (S,<br>\
K, &amp;c.,) and in a man. (S, TA.) You say also<br>\
لَقِحَتِ النَّاقَةُ عَنْ عُقْرٍ [The she-camel conceived<br>\
after having been barren]. (S, O.) And لَقِحَ<br>\
لِقَاؤُكَ عَنْ عُقْرٍ [app., (assumed tropical:)  The meeting thee hath been<br>\
productive of good after barrenness thereof]. (A,<br>\
TA.) And لَقِحْنَ إِلَى عُقْرٍ, a phrase used by<br>\
Dhu-r-Rummeh, referring to wars; i. e. (assumed tropical:)  They<br>\
returned to stillness. (TA.) And رَجَعَتِ الحَرْبُ<br>\
إِلَى عُقْرٍ (assumed tropical:)  The war became languid. (A, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  عُقْرٌ in a palm-tree means [Barrenness, or a<br>\
drying up, and perishing, occasioned by] having<br>\
the [fibrous substance called] لِيف stripped off<br>\
(O, K, TA) from the heart, (O, TA,) and the<br>\
heart itself taken away; (O, K, TA;) which<br>\
being done, it dries up and perishes. (Az, O,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, or ↓ عُقُرٌ, or the latter is used only<br>\
by poetic license, Anything which a man drinks,<br>\
and in consequence thereof has no offspring born<br>\
to him. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, عُقْرٌ, A kind of dowry,<br>\
(S,) or compensation, (IAth,) which is given to a<br>\
woman when connection has been had with her in<br>\
consequence of dubiousness, or a likeness [on her<br>\
part to the man&#39;s wife]: (إِذَا وُطِئَتْ عَنْ شُبْهَةٍ, S;<br>\
or بِشُبْهَةٍ, Mgh; or عَلَى وَطْءِ الشُّبْهَةِ, IAth:) or a<br>\
recompense which is given to a woman for connection with her: (AO:) or a mulct, or fine, which<br>\
is paid to a woman for ravishing her: (Lth, Msb,<br>\
K:) or what is given to a female slave who has<br>\
been ravished, like a dowry in the like case to a<br>\
free woman: (Ahmad Ibn-Hambal:) so called<br>\
because devirgination wounds the object of it:<br>\
pl. أَعْقَارٌ. (IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, in consequence<br>\
of frequency of usage, (Msb,) A woman&#39;s dowry;<br>\
(Msb, K;) i. q. بُضْعُهَا. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The exploration of a woman to see if she be a virgin or<br>\
not: (Kh, O, K, TA:) but Az says that this is<br>\
unknown. (TA.) [Perhaps it is a meaning inferred from what here follows.] ―<br>\
-b4-  بَيْضَةُ العُقْرِ is<br>\
That [egg] with which a woman is tested on the<br>\
occasion of devirgination: (K: [but what is<br>\
meant by this, I have not been able to learn:])<br>\
or the first egg of the hen; (K, TA;) because it<br>\
wounds her: (TA:) or the last egg of the hen;<br>\
(O, K, TA;) when she is old and weak: (TA:)<br>\
or the egg of the cock, which [they say] he lays<br>\
once in the year, (O, K,) [or once in his life, for]<br>\
they assert that it is the egg of the cock, because<br>\
he lays, in his life, one egg, somewhat inclining to<br>\
length; so called because the virginity of the girl,<br>\
or young woman, is tested with it: hence, they<br>\
say of a thing given one time [only], كَانَتْ بَيْضَةَ<br>\
العُقْرِ: or, as some say, it is like the phrases بَيْضُ<br>\
الأَنُوقِ and الأَبْلَقُ العَقُوقُ; so that it is a phrase<br>\
proverbially used as applied to a thing that never<br>\

afterwards said of any one who raised his voice,<br>\
singing. (Az, TA.)<br>\
