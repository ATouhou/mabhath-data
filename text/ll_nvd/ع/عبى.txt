عَبَّيْتُ الجَيْشَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. تَعْبِيَةٌ (S, K)<br>\
and تَعْبِئَةٌ and تَعْبِىْءٌ, so said Yoo; but AZ said<br>\
عَبَّأْتُهُ; (S; [see art. عبأ;]) I prepared, or made<br>\
ready, (S, K, *) or set in order, disposed, or<br>\
arranged, (Msb,) the army (S, Msb, K) in their<br>\
places. (S, K.) ―<br>\

التَّعَابِى signifies The aiding, or assisting, of<br>\
one party by one man, and of another party by<br>\
another man, when they prepare a repast, one of<br>\
the two parties making bread for this, and the<br>\
other for another. (K.)<br>\

الاِعْتِبَآءُ, mentioned here in the TA, as syn.<br>\
with الاِحْتِشَآءُ, see 8 in art. عبأ.<br>\
عَبًا and ↓ عَبَايَةٌ, but the former the more chaste,<br>\
are said to signify, as epithets applied to a man,<br>\
Coarse, or rude, heavy, dull, or stupid, (K, * TA,)<br>\
and impotent: but this requires correction; for<br>\
Lth mentions العَبَا, and ↓ العَبَآءُ as used by a<br>\
poet, and says that they signify the coarse, or<br>\
rude, impotent, man; but Az says that he had<br>\
not heard العَبَآء in this sense on any authority<br>\
other than that of Lth, and that he held the right<br>\
reading in the verse cited as an ex. by Lth to be<br>\
العَيَآء, with ى, meaning, as also العَيَايَآء, “the<br>\
coarse, or rude, or the heavy, dull, or stupid, and<br>\
impotent, who has no need of women. ” (TA.)<br>\
عَبَآءٌ: see عَبَايَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  And see also<br>\
عَبًا, above.<br>\
عباة [app. عَبَاةٌ] The [kind of plant called]<br>\
سُطَّاح that spreads upon the ground. (TA.)<br>\
عَبِىٌّ One&#39;s share of the جَزُور [or slaughtered<br>\
camel for portions of which the players at the<br>\
game called المَيْسِر contend]. (K, TA.)<br>\
عَبَايَةٌ and عَبَآءَةٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA) A sort<br>\
of [the kind of garments called] أَكْسِيَة [pl. of<br>\
كِسَآء], (S, Mgh, * K, TA,) wide, (Mgh, TA,)<br>\
and [generally] having in it large black [or<br>\
brown] stripes: (TA:) pl. [of the latter] عَبَاآتٌ<br>\
(S, Msb) and ↓ عَبَآءٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) formed by the<br>\
elision of the ة, (Msb,) [or rather this is a coll.<br>\
gen. n.,] and the pl. of عَبَايَةٌ is عُبِىٌّ, like عُتِىٌّ:<br>\
or, accord. to some, ↓ عَبَآءٌ is a sing.; for they<br>\
say that it signifies a sort of أَكْسِيَة, and that its<br>\
pl. is أَعْبِيَةٌ. (TA.) See عَبَآءَةٌ in art. عبأ.<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also عَبًأ, above.<br>\
