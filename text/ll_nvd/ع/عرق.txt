the verb when used absolutely], (S, O, K,) and<br>\

of the flesh has been taken, some thin and savoury<br>\
portions of flesh remaining upon it: (TA:) or the<br>\
former signifies a bone upon which is flesh: and<br>\
one upon which is no flesh: or, as some say,<br>\
whereof most of that which was upon it has been<br>\

↓ عَرْقَةٌ: (TA:) or عَرْقٌ signifies a bone with its<br>\
flesh: and ↓ عُرَاقٌ, a bone of which the flesh has<br>\
been eaten: (K:) thus they are correctly expl.<br>\
accord. to Ez-Zejjájee; and the like is said by<br>\
AZ respecting ↓ عُرَاقٌ: (TA:) but accord. to<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd, this signifies a piece of flesh-meat; and<br>\
IAmb says that this is the right explanation, because the Arabs say أَكَلْتُ العُرَاقَ, and they do<br>\
not say أَكَلْتُ العَظْمَ: (Har p.26:) [or, app.,<br>\
the flesh-meat of a bone: and likewise the portions, of trees, that are cropped by camels: (see<br>\
عُرَامٌ:)] the pl. (of عَرْقٌ, S, Mgh, O) is ↓ عُرَاقٌ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, K,) which is extr, (IAth, K,) a pl.<br>\
of a measure of which, as that of a pl., there are<br>\
few instances, (ISk, S, O,) [see an ex. voce<br>\
جَنَاحٌ,] and عِرَاقٌ, also, (IAar, K,) which is more<br>\

O, Msb) after it has been waste, (S, O, Msb, *)<br>\
wrongfully, in order that he may have a claim to<br>\
that land: (S, Mgh, O, Msb:) the epithet being<br>\
tropically applied to the عِرْق, (Mgh, Msb,) as it<br>\
properly applies to the owner thereof: (Mgh:)<br>\
but some, in relating this trad., say لِعِرْقِ ظَالِمٍ,<br>\

latter, governing it in the gen. case. (O.) ―<br>\

roots of the أَرْطَى (عُرُوقُ الأَرْطَى) are long, red,<br>\
penetrating into the moist earth, succulent, compact, and dripping with water: and to them, in<br>\

their redness and plumpness and the compactness<br>\
of their flesh and fat. (TA.) ―<br>\

O:) or العُرُوقُ الصُّفْرُ, a certain plant used by the<br>\

-b5-  See also عِرَاقٌ,<br>\
latter half, in two places.<br>\
-A4-  عِرْقُ مَضَنَّةٍ and عِلْقُ<br>\
مَضَنَّةٍ (the latter of which is that commonly<br>\
known, TA) signify A thing of which one is tenacious; (O;) a thing held in high estimation, of<br>\
which one is tenacious, (S and K and TA in art.<br>\
ضن,) and for which people vie in desire: (TA in<br>\
that art.:) but [said to be] used only in a case of<br>\
negation: one says, مَا هُوَ عِنْدِى بِعِرْقِ مَضَنَّةٍ,<br>\
meaning It is not, in my estimation, a thing of<br>\
any value, or worth. (TA.)<br>\
عَرَقٌ Sweat; i. e. the moisture, or fluid, that<br>\
exudes (S, * O, * K, TA) from the skin of an<br>\
animal; (K, TA;) or the water of the skin, that<br>\
runs from the roots of the hair: a gen. n.; having<br>\
no pl.; (TA;) or no pl. of it has been heard:<br>\
(Msb:) Lth says, I have not heard a pl. of العَرَقُ;<br>\
but if it be pluralized, it should be, accord. to<br>\
analogy, أَعْرَاقٌ. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is metaphorically<br>\
used [in a similar sense] in relation to other things<br>\
than animals. (K.) [Thus] it signifies The<br>\
[exuded] moisture of a well: (K:) and in like<br>\
manner of earth, or land, when the dew, or rain,<br>\
has percolated in it (نَتَحَ فِيهَا) so that it has met<br>\
the moisture thereof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The دِبْس<br>\
[or honey] of dates; (K;) because it flows, or exudes, from them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And Milk; because it<br>\
flows in the ducts (عُرُوق) [thereof] until it comes<br>\
at the last to the udder: (K:) or milk at the time<br>\
of bringing forth; as in the saying, مَا أَكْثَرَ عَرَقَ<br>\
غَنَمِكِ How abundant is the milk of thy sheep, or<br>\
goats, at the time of their bringing forth! (AZ,<br>\
O.) [See also عِرْقٌ, latter half.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And (K)<br>\
The offspring of camels: (S, O, K:) so in the<br>\
saying, مَا أَكْثَرَ عَرَقَ إِبِلِهِ [How numerous are the<br>\
offspring of his camels!]. (S, O.) [See, again,<br>\
عِرْقٌ, latter half.] ―<br>\
-b6-  And Advantage, profit,<br>\
utility, or benefit: (O, K, TA; in [several of]<br>\
the copies of the second of which, النَّقْعُ is erroneously put for النَّفْعُ: TA:) and a recompense,<br>\
or reward: (K, TA; in some copies of the former<br>\
of which, التُّرَابُ is erroneously put for الثَّوَابُ:<br>\
TA:) or a little thereof; (K, TA;) likened to<br>\
عَرَق [as meaning “ sweat ”]. (TA.) عَرَقُ الخِلَالِ<br>\
means A thing that one gives, or yields, for<br>\
friendship: (S, O, TA:) or a reward for friendship. (TA.) A poet says, namely El-Hárith<br>\
Ibn-Zuheyr, describing a sword named النُّون,<br>\
(O, TA,) belonging to Málik Ibn-Zuheyr, which<br>\
Hamal Ibn-Bedr took from him on the day when<br>\
he slew him, and which El-Hárith took from<br>\
Hamal when he slew him, (TA,)<br>\
وَيُخْبِرُهُمْ مَكَانَ النُّونِ مِنِّى<br>\
وَمَا أُعْطِيتُهُ عَرَقَ الخِلَالِ<br>\
[And he shall tell them the place of En-Noon,<br>\
from me, and that I was not given it as a reward<br>\
for friendship]; meaning, that I took this sword<br>\
by force. (O, TA. [In the S, the former hemistich of this verse is given differently, and, as is<br>\
said in the TA, erroneously.]) ―<br>\
-b7-  لَقِيتُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ<br>\
عَرَقَ القِرْبَةِ (which is a prov., TA) means [I experienced from such a one] hardship, as expl. by<br>\
As, who says that he knew not the origin thereof,<br>\
(S, O,) or difficulty, or distress, as expl. by IDrd:<br>\
(O:) and it is said that the عَرَق [or sweat] is of<br>\
the man, not of the قِرْبَة [or water-skin]; and the<br>\
origin of the saying is, that water-skins (قِرَب) are<br>\
[generally] carried only by female slaves that<br>\
bear burdens, and by him who has no assistant;<br>\
but sometimes a man of generous origin becomes<br>\
poor, and in need of carrying them himself, and<br>\
he sweats by reason of the trouble that comes upon<br>\
him, and of shame; (S, O;) wherefore one says,<br>\
تَجَشَّمْتُ لَكَ عَرَقَ القِرْبَةِ [expl. in art. جشم], (S,)<br>\
or جَشِمْتُ إِلَيْكَ عَرَقَ القِرْبَةِ [likewise expl. in art.<br>\
جشم]: accord. to Ks, the meaning is, I have<br>\
suffered fatigue, and imposed upon myself difficulty, for thee, [or in coming to thee,] so that I<br>\
have sweated like the sweating of the water-skin:<br>\
or, accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, I have imposed upon<br>\
myself, in coming to thee, what no one has attained, and what will not be; because the قربة<br>\
does not sweat: (O:) عَرَقُ القِرْبَةِ is a metonymical<br>\
expression for hardship, and difficulty, or distress;<br>\
because, when the قربة sweats, its odour becomes<br>\
foul: or because it has no sweat; therefore it is<br>\
as though one imposed upon himself an impossible thing: or it means the benefit of the قربة;<br>\
(which is the flowing of its water, TA;) as though<br>\
one imposed upon himself such a task that he became in need of the water of the قربة, i. e. of<br>\
journeying to it; or it means a سَفِيفَة [or plaited<br>\
suspensory] which the carrier of the قربة puts over<br>\
his chest [when carrying the قربة on his back]:<br>\
(K:) accord. to IAar, it signifies the suspensory<br>\
(مِعْلَاق) by means of which the قربة is carried;<br>\
as also عَلَقُهَا; (O, TA;) the ر being substituted<br>\
for ل: (TA: see art. ر:]) but he says also that<br>\
عَرَقُ القِرْبَةِ means one&#39;s sweating with the قربة by<br>\
reason of the difficulty, or trouble, of carrying<br>\
it; and عَلَقُهَا, that by which it is tied, or bound,<br>\
and then suspended: (L, TA:) the former is also<br>\
said to signify the ↓ عِرَاق [q. v.] of the قربة, that<br>\
is sewed around it: (TA:) or it means that one<br>\
has imposed upon himself difficulty, or trouble,<br>\
or fatigue, like that of the carrier of the قربة, who<br>\
sweats beneath it by reason of its heaviness. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  عَرَقٌ also signifies A heat; i. e. a single run,<br>\
or a run at once, to a goal, or limit. (S, O, K.)<br>\
One says, جَرَى الفَرَسُ عَرَقًا or عَرَقَيْنِ The horse<br>\
ran a heat or two heats. (S, O.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A row<br>\
of horses, and of birds, (S, O, Msb, K,) and the<br>\
like; (S, Msb;) and any things disposed in a row;<br>\
(S, O, K, TA;) as also ↓ عَرَقَةٌ; (TA;) or this<br>\
latter is the n. un. [app. signifying one of such<br>\
as compose a row]: (S:) pl. أَعْرَاقٌ and عَرَقَاتٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) [See an ex. in a verse of Tufeyl cited in<br>\
art. صدر, conj. 5; also cited in the present<br>\
art. in the S and O.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And Any row of<br>\
bricks, crude and baked, in a wall: one says,<br>\
بَنَى البَانِى عَرَقًا وَعَرَقَيْنِ and وَعَرَقَتَيْنِ ↓ عَرَقَةً [The<br>\
builder built a row of bricks and two rows thereof]:<br>\
(K, TA:) pl. أَعْرَاقٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Roads in<br>\
mountains; as also ↓ عَرْقَةٌ, (K, TA,) with fet-h<br>\
and then sukoon. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And Foot-marks of<br>\
camels following one another: (K, TA:) n. un.<br>\
↓ عَرَقَةٌ. (TA.) [See an ex. of the latter voce<br>\
طَرَقٌ.] A poet says,<br>\
وَقَدْ نَسَجْنَ بِالفَلَاةِ عَرَقَا<br>\
[And they had woven in the desert, or waterless<br>\
desert, foot-marks in their following one another].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And A plait of palm-leaves (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K) &amp;c. (S, O) before a زَبِيل [so in the S and O]<br>\
or زِنْبِيل [so in the K, both meaning the same,<br>\
i. e. a basket,] is made therewith: (S, O, K:) or<br>\
a زِنْبِيل itself: (K:) or hence (S, O) it signifies<br>\
also (S, O, Msb) a زَبِيل (S, O) or [what is called]<br>\
a مِكْتَل (Mgh, Msb) and زِنْبِيل, (Msb,) of large<br>\
size, woven of palm-leaves, (Mgh,) capable of<br>\
containing fifteen times as much as the measure<br>\
termed ضاع, as some say, (Mgh, Msb,) or thirty<br>\
times as much as that measure: (Mgh:) also pronounced ↓ عَرْقٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [And A suspensory of a<br>\
زَبِيل: see حَتِىٌّ, in art. حتى. (A similar meaning has been mentioned above, in this paragraph.)]<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  See also عَرَقَةٌ.<br>\
-A3-  And Raisins. (K. [But this<br>\
is said in the TA to be extr.: and I think it to<br>\
have been probably taken from some copy of a<br>\
lexicon in which زِبَيب has been erroneously<br>\
written for زِبَيل.])<br>\
لَبَنٌ عَرِقٌ Milk of which the flavour is corrupted<br>\
by the sweat of the camel upon which it is borne;<br>\
(S, O, K;) the skin containing it being bound<br>\
upon him without any preservative between it and<br>\
his side. (S, O.)<br>\
عُرَقٌ: see عُرَقَةٌ.<br>\
عُرُقٌ a pl. of عِرَاقٌ [q. v.]. (Lth, AZ, S, &amp;c.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also expl. by IAar as meaning People<br>\
of soundness in religion. (TA.)<br>\

Also The piece of wood, or timber, that intervenes<br>\
between the [or any] two rows of bricks of a wall.<br>\

-b5-  And The plaited<br>\
thong with which a captive is bound: pl. عَرَقَاتٌ<br>\
and [coll. gen. n.] ↓ عَرَقٌ: (K:) or عَرَقَاتٌ signifies [simply] plaited thongs (نُسُوع). (S, O.)<br>\
عُرَقَةٌ, (S, O, K,) which is agreeable with general analogy, and ↓ عُرَقٌ, (K, TA,) which is not<br>\
so, but which is used by some in the same sense<br>\
as the former, (TA,) A man who sweats much,<br>\
(S, O, K, TA.)<br>\
عَرْقٍ, originally عَرْقُوٌ: see عَرْقُوَةٌ, of which it is a<br>\
coll. gen. n.<br>\
[<br>\
عرقى, said by Reiske to signify The inner and<br>\
thin skin in the egg of an ostrich, is evidently a<br>\
mistake for غِرْقِئٌ.]<br>\
عَرْقَاةٌ: see عَرْقُوَةٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and the paragraph here<br>\
following, in two places:<br>\

عِرْقَاةٌ (O, K) and ↓ عَرْقَاةٌ and ↓ عِرْقَةٌ (K) A<br>\
root, race, stock, or source; syn. أَصْلٌ: (O, K:)<br>\
or a source of wealth or property: or the main<br>\
portion of the root of a tree. from which the عُرُوق<br>\
[or minor roots] branch off: (K:) or, as some<br>\
say, عِرْقَاةٌ has this last meaning; or, as others<br>\
say, ↓ عِرْقَةٌ. (Ltl., O.) They said, اِسْتَأْصَلَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
↓ عَرْقَاتَهُمْ and عِرْقَاتِهِمْ; if they pronounced the<br>\
first letter with fet-h, they so pronounced the last<br>\
letter [before the pronoun]; and if they pronounced the former with kesr, they thus pronounced the latter, regarding the word as pl. of<br>\
↓ عِرْقَةٌ: (K:) or, accord. to Lth, the Arabs are<br>\
related to have said, اِسْتَأْصَلَ اللّٰهُ عِرْقَاتَهُمْ, meaning<br>\
شَأْفَتَهُمْ [i. e. May God utterly destroy their race,<br>\
stock, or family], pronouncing the ت with nasb<br>\
because regarding the word as [a sing.] like<br>\
سِعْلَاةٌ; or holding it to be pl. of ↓ عِرْقَةٌ, but pronouncing the تَ thus like as they do in saying<br>\
رَأَيْتُ بَنَاتَكَ: it is said, however, that this is a<br>\
mistake; that only he should pronounce it thus<br>\
who makes the word to be a sing. like سِعْلَاةٌ.<br>\
(O.) [The saying is a prov., mentioned by<br>\
Meyd, who adds another reading, namely, عَرَقَاتهم,<br>\
holding this to be from ↓ العَرَقَةُ meaning “ the طُرَّة<br>\
that is woven around the فُسْطَاط: ” and Freytag,<br>\
in his Lexicon, adds also عَرِقاتَه, with nasb, as on<br>\
the authority of Meyd; in whose “ Proverbs ” I<br>\
do not find it.]<br>\
عَرْقَان [accord. to general analogy without tenween and having for its fem. عَرْقَى, or accord. to<br>\
the dial. of the Benoo-Asad with tenween and<br>\
having for its fem. عَرْقَانَةٌ,] Sweating. (Msb.)<br>\
عَرْقُوَةُ الدَّلْوِ is thus, (S, O, K,) with fet-h to the<br>\
ع, (S, O,) like تَرْقُوَة, (K,) and should not be pronounced with damm to the first letter; (S, O, K;)<br>\
and ↓ عَرْقَاتُهَا signifies the same; (K, TA; [in the<br>\
CK, erroneously, عَرَقَاتُها; but expressly stated in<br>\
the TA to be with fet-h and then sukoon;]) i. e.<br>\
The piece of wood that is put across the دلو [or<br>\

keep it from collapsing and for the purpose of<br>\
attaching thereto the well-rope], like a cross:<br>\
(As, S, O, K:) pl. عَرَاقٍ; (S, O, K;) and if you<br>\
pluralize it by suppressing the ة [of the sing., or<br>\
rather if you form from it a coll. gen. n.], you<br>\
say ↓ عَرْقٍ, originally عَرْقُوٌ, (S, O, L,) then عَرْقِىٌ,<br>\
and then عَرْقٍ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  العَرْقُوَتَانِ also signifies<br>\

or, accord. to Lth, two pieces of wood which are<br>\
upon the عَضُدَانِ [q. v.], on the two sides of the<br>\

-b3-  ذَاتُ العَرَاقِى<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  Calamity, or misfortune: (S, O, K, TA:)<br>\
for it is [properly] the دَلْو [or leathern bucket];<br>\
and الدَّلْوُ is one of the names for calamity: one<br>\
says, لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ ذَاتَ العَرَاقِى [I experienced from<br>\
it, or him, calamity]: (TA:) or, as some say, it<br>\
is from what here follows. (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عَرَاقِى<br>\
الإِكَامِ signifies Such [eminences of the kind called<br>\

heap over a grave, (Lth, O, K,) elongated: (Lth,<br>\
O:) an أَكَمَة that extends, not high, but overtopping what is around it, near to the ground or<br>\
not near, and varying in different parts so that<br>\
one place thereof is soft and another place thereof<br>\
rugged; being only a level portion of the earth<br>\
overtopping what is around it: (ISh, TA:) and<br>\
العَرَاقِى is also said to signify continuous, or connected, إِكَام, that have become as though they<br>\
were one long جُرْف [or abrupt, water-worn bank<br>\
or ridge] upon the face of the earth. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
العَرَاقِى signifies also The collar-bones (التَّرَاقِى),<br>\
in the dial. of El-Yemen. (L, TA.)<br>\

render تَقَارُبُ الخرزِ; reading الخُرَزِ: and it seems<br>\
to mean also uniformity thereof: for it is added,]<br>\

by the epithet when used absolutely], (S, O, K,)<br>\
and also in meanness or ignobleness [thereof; or<br>\
having a strain of, i. e. an inborn disposition to,<br>\
generousness or nobleness, and also meanness or<br>\
