عَجڤزَ The primary signification of عَجْزٌ [an inf. n.<br>\
of عَجَزَ] is The being, or becoming, behind, or<br>\
behindhand, or backward, with respect to a thing;<br>\
or holding back, hanging back, or abstaining, from<br>\
it: and its happening at the latter, or last, part,<br>\
or at the end, of an affair: and hence, in common<br>\
conventional language, it has the signification<br>\
shown by the explanation here next following.<br>\
(Er-Rághib, B, &amp;c., and TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَجَزَ, aor.<br>\
عَجِزَ,<br>\
inf. n. عَجْزٌ and مَعْجَزَةٌ and مَعْجِزَةٌ (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K) and مَعْجَزٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) which is<br>\
agreeable with rule, (S,) and مَعْجِزٌ, (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) which is extr., (Sb, TA,) and عَجَزَانٌ and<br>\
عُجُوزٌ; (O, K;) and عَجِزَ, aor.<br>\
عَجَزَ, (O, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. عَجَزٌ, (Msb,) said by IKtt to be mentioned<br>\
by Fr, as of the dial. of some of the tribe of Keys,<br>\
but by others [and among them Sgh in the O]<br>\
said to be a bad form, (TA,) or mentioned by<br>\
AZ, as of the dial. of some of the tribe of Keys-<br>\
&#39;Eylán, but not known to them, and said by IF<br>\
to be disallowed by IAar in the sense here immediately following; (Msb;) He lacked strength, or<br>\
power, or ability; he was, or became, powerless,<br>\
impotent, or unable. (S, * Msb, * K, TA.) You<br>\
say, عَجَزَ عَنْ كَذَا, (S, A, O, Msb, TA,) and<br>\
accord. to some, as shown above, عَجِزَ عَنْهُ,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) He lacked strength, or power, or<br>\
ability, for, or to do, effect, accomplish, achieve,<br>\
attain, or compass, such a thing; he was unable<br>\
to do it: (S, * O, * Msb, * TA:) or (tropical:)  he was too<br>\
old to do it. (A, TA.) And it is said in a trad.,<br>\
(S, * Mgh,) of &#39;Omar, (TA,) لَا تُلِثُّوا بِدَارِ مَعْجَزَةٍ,<br>\
meaning Remain ye not in a country, or district,<br>\
or town, where ye are unable to gain your livelihood.<br>\
(S, A, Mgh, * TA.) You say also, لَا يَسَعُنِى شَىْءٌ<br>\
وَيَعْجِزُ عَنْكَ (tropical:)  [app. A thing will not suffice me<br>\
when it cannot thee]. (A, TA.) And جَاؤُوا<br>\
بِجَيْشٍ تَعْجِزُ الأَرْضُ عَنْهُ (tropical:)  [They came with an<br>\
army which the earth had not strength to bear,<br>\
or scarce sufficed to contain]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And<br>\
عَجَزَ عَنْ كَذَا also signifies He, or it, lacked such<br>\
a thing: see an ex. voce عَرْفٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,]<br>\
عَجَزَتْ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\

عَجِزَ,<br>\
(Msb,) inf. n. عُجُوزٌ (S, O, K) and عَجْزٌ, (TA,)<br>\

تَعْجِيزٌ. (S, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  عَجِزَتْ, aor.<br>\
عَجَزَ, (S, O, K,)<br>\

(a man) became large therein: (Msb:) accord. to<br>\
IAar, as related by Th, one does not say thus of<br>\
a man except in this sense. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
عَجِزَتِ الرَّمْلَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The piece of sand became high.<br>\

-b3-  He,<br>\
or it, rendered him (صَيَّرَهُ) unable (TS, K, TA)<br>\
to attain, or overtake, him: (TS, TA:) ―<br>\
-b4-  and<br>\

unable to reach, or overtake, him. (Lth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
[It frustrated his power or ability, or his skill,<br>\

-A2-<br>\
See also عَجُزٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [And see عَجِزَتْ.]<br>\
عِجْزٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
عَجُزٌ (S, A, O, L, Msb, K) and ↓ عَجْزٌ (O, L,<br>\
Msb, K) and ↓ عُجُزٌ (L, Msb) and ↓ عُجْزٌ (O, L,<br>\
Msb, K) and ↓ عَجِزٌ (O, L, K) and ↓ عِجْزٌ, (K,)<br>\
but the first form is the most chaste, (Msb,) fem.<br>\
and masc., (S, O, Msb, K,) in the first of the<br>\
following senses, i. e., in the general application;<br>\
and in the second, or restricted application, fem.,<br>\
but made masc. by the Benoo- Temeem, (Msb,)<br>\
or, accord. to El-Heythemee, fem. only, (TA,)<br>\
The hinder part of a thing; (S, A, O, L, Msb,<br>\
K;) i. e., of anything: (Msb:) and particularly<br>\
the hinder parts, posteriors, buttock, or buttocks,<br>\
rump, or croup, (S, * O, *) or what is between the<br>\
two hips, (Mgh, Msb,) or what is after the back,<br>\
(TA,) of a man, and of a woman; (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, TA;) [and of a camel, &amp;c.;] and ↓ عَجِيزَةٌ<br>\
signifies the same, but of a woman only, (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) in its proper application, though sometimes of a man also by way of comparison:<br>\
(IAth, Mgh, TA:) pl. of عَجُزٌ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
and of its variants, (Msb, K,) أَعْجَازٌ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) the only pl. form: (TA:) and of ↓ عَجِيزَةٌ,<br>\
عَجِيزَاتٌ: they do not say عَجَائِزُ, [the regular<br>\
form of pl. of عجيزة,] for fear of confusion [as<br>\
it is pl. of عَجُوزٌ or of عَجُوزَةٌ]. (TA.) One<br>\
says also, إِنَّهَا لَعَظيِمَةُ الأَعْجَازِ Verily she is large<br>\
in the hinder parts: as though the term عَجُزٌ<br>\
were applicable to every portion thereof. (Lh,<br>\
TA.) And رَكِبَ فِى الطَّلَبِ أَعْجَازَ الإِبِلِ He<br>\
exposed himself, in seeking [a thing], to abasement<br>\
and difficulty and patient endurance, and exerted<br>\
unsparingly his power or ability, (K, TA,) not<br>\
caring for undergoing long night-journeying. (TA.)<br>\
Thus expl. in a saying of &#39;Alee: لَنَا حَقٌّ إِنْ نُعْطَهُ<br>\
نَأْخُذْهُ وَإِنْ نُمْنَعْهُ نَرْكَبْ أَعْجَازَ الإِبِلِ وَإِنْ طَالَ<br>\
السُّرَى [There is a right belonging to us: if we be<br>\
given it, we take it: and if we be refused it, we<br>\
expose ourselves to abasement, &amp;c., though the<br>\
night-journeying be long]: (O, * TA:) or, accord.<br>\
to Az, he does not mean this, but alludes to<br>\
others&#39; having precedence in respect of his right,<br>\
and his being himself kept back from it. (TA.)<br>\
One also says, بَنُو فُلَانٍ يَرْكَبُونَ أَعْجَازَ الإِبِلِ<br>\
The sons of such a one are in a state of abasement,<br>\
dependents of others: or experience difficulties;<br>\
because the rump, or croup, of the camel is a<br>\
difficult place to ride upon. (A.) And it is said<br>\
by one of the wise, (Aktham Ibn-Seyfee, T, in<br>\
TA, art. دبر,) لَا تَدَبَّرُوا أَعْجَازَ أُمُورٍ قَدْ وَلَّتْ<br>\
صُدُورُهَا, (TA, in this art., and O,) or لَا تَتَدَبَّرُوا,<br>\
(T, in TA, art. دبر,) (tropical:)  [Think ye not upon the<br>\
ends of things whereof the beginnings have passed:]<br>\
meaning, when a thing has passed, make not your<br>\
minds, or desires, to follow after it, regretting<br>\
what has passed, but be consoled for it, placing<br>\
your reliance upon God: (O, TA:) and, as IAth<br>\
says, it is intended to incite to the consideration<br>\
of the results, or issues, of affairs before the<br>\
entering upon them. (TA.) [See also دَبَّرَ.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
أَعْجَازُ نَخْلٍ The trunks of palm-trees. (S, O, K.)<br>\
[See Kur liv. 20 and lxix. 7.) And أَعْجَازُ الصِّلِّيَانِ<br>\
[The stems of the صِلِّيَان]. (AHn, M in art. صل.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  عَجُزٌ also signifies The last foot of a verse;<br>\
contr. of صَدْرٌ. (TA.) And The latter hemistich<br>\
of a verse: the former hemistich is termed صَدْرٌ.<br>\
(O.) [And The last word of a clause of rhyming<br>\
prose. And the latter part of a word.]<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also عَاجِزٌ.<br>\
-A3-  أَيَّامُ العَجُزِ: see عَجُوزٌ.<br>\

عُجْزَةٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
عِجْزَةٌ The last of the children of a man; (S,<br>\
O, K;) as also ↓ عُجْزَةٌ. (IAar, O, K.) You<br>\
say, فُلَانٌ عِجْزَةُ وَلَدِ أَبَوَيْهِ Such a one is the last<br>\
of the children of his parents; and in like manner<br>\
you say of a female, and of a plural number: (S,<br>\
O, TA:) and so, [accord. to some,] كِبْرَةُ وَلَدِ<br>\
أَبَوَيْهِ. (TA.) You say also, وُلِدَ لِعِجْزَةٍ He was<br>\
born after his parents had become old: and such<br>\
you term اِبْنُ العِجْزَةِ. (O, TA.)<br>\
عَجُوزٌ i. q. عَاجِزٌ, q. v. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  An old, or<br>\
aged, woman: (S, O, Msb, K:) a woman extremely old; or old and weak: so called because<br>\
of her inability to do many things: (TA:) [this is<br>\
the most common signification of the word:]<br>\
accord. to ISk, (S, O, Msb,) you should not say<br>\
↓ عَجُوزَةٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;) or this is bad; (K;)<br>\
and is said by the vulgar; (S, O;) but IAar<br>\
authorizes it; (O;) and IAmb allows it, to demonstrate its being fem.; and Yoo is related to<br>\
have heard it from the Arabs: (Msb:) pl. عَجَائِزُ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K,) or this is pl. of عَجُوزَةٌ; (R,<br>\
TA;) and عُجُزٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and عُجْزٌ, a<br>\
contraction of عُجُزٌ, occurring in traditions. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  A man&#39;s wife, whether old or young: (Az,<br>\
O, K, * TA:) and in like manner, the husband,<br>\
though young, is called شَيْخٌ. (Az, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
An old, or aged, man: (O, TA:) a man extremely old; or old and weak. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  (tropical:)  Wine;<br>\

called الكَلْبُ. (IAar, O, TA.) Az approves of<br>\
this explanation. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A sword-blade. (Lth,<br>\
S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A sword. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [It has a<br>\
great variety of other significations; but these<br>\
are of very rare occurrence, and are therefore to<br>\
be mentioned (ان شآء اللّٰه) in Book II.]<br>\
-A4-  أَيَّامُ<br>\
العَجُوزِ; (S, O, K;) also called ↓ أَيَّامُ العَجُزِ, because they come in the latter part (عَجُز) of<br>\
winter; but the former is the correct appellation;<br>\
(MF;) accord. to the usage of the Arabs, Five<br>\
days, the names of which are صِنٌّ and صِنَّبْرٌ and<br>\
وَبْرٌ and مُطْفِئُ الجَمْرِ and مُكْفِئُ الظَّعْنِ; said by<br>\
Ibn-Kunáseh to be of the نَوْء of الصَّرْفَة [by which<br>\
is meant the auroral setting of the Twelfth Mansion of the Moon, which, in Central Arabia, about<br>\
the commencement of the era of the Flight,<br>\
happened on the 9th of March O. S.: in the<br>\
modern Egyptian Almanacs, the ايّام العجوز are<br>\
said to commence now on the 9th of March N. S.,<br>\
which is now the 26th of February O. S.]: (S,<br>\
O, TA:) or, accord. to Abu-l-Ghowth, (S,) they<br>\
are seven days, (S, K,) named صِنٌّ and صِنَّبْرٌ and<br>\
وَبْرٌ and الآمِرُ and المُؤْتَمِرُ and المُعَلِّلُ and مُطْفِئُ<br>\
الجَمْرِ, or مُكْفِئُ الظَّعْنِ: (K:) and some reckon<br>\
مكفئ الظعن an eighth: but most authors hold<br>\
these names to be post-classical: (MF:) accord.<br>\
to Esh-Shereeshee, they are seven days; four of<br>\
the last [days] of February, and three of the first<br>\
[days] of March: (Har p. 295:) during these<br>\
days blew the wind by which the tribe of &#39;Ád<br>\
was destroyed: and they are thus called because<br>\
they are [in] the latter part (عَجْز) of winter; or<br>\
because an old woman (عَجُوز) of &#39;Ád concealed<br>\
herself in a subterranean excavation, from which<br>\
the wind dragged her forth on the eighth day,<br>\
and destroyed her: (Bd in lxix. 7:) or آمِرٌ and<br>\
مُؤْتَمِرٌ are the names of the last two days; (K in<br>\
art. امر;) the former being the sixth, and the<br>\
latter the seventh. (M in that art.) Ibn-Ahmar<br>\
says, (S,) or, accord. to IB, not Ibn-Ahmar,<br>\
but Aboo-Shibl &#39;Ásim Ibn-el-Aarábee, as Th says,<br>\
on the authority of IAar, (TA,) or Aboo-Shibl<br>\
&#39;Osm Ibn-Wahb Et-Temeemee, (O,)<br>\

lacking strength, or power, or ability, to do a<br>\
thing; unable to do a thing. (IAar, TA.) And<br>\
