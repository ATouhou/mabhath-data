عَىَّ بِأَمْرِهِ, (S,) or بِالأَمْرِ, (MA, Msb, K,) and<br>\
عَن الأَمْرِ, (MA,) and الأَمْرَ also, (MA, and Ham<br>\
p. 717,) and عَيِىَ, (S, Msb, K,) [which is the<br>\
original form,] but عَىَّ is more common, (S,<br>\
TA,) and أَعْيَا بِهِ is not allowable, (TA,) first<br>\
pers. عَيِيتُ, (S,) pl. عَيُوا, (S, TA,) like حَيُوا<br>\
[from حَىَّ and حَيِىَ], (S,) and عَيُّوا also, which<br>\
is used by a poet, (S, TA,) aor. يَعْيَا, (Msb, TA),<br>\
inf. n. عِىٌّ; (Msb, TA;) as also ↓ تعيّا, and<br>\
↓ تعايا, and ↓ استعيا; (K;) He found not the<br>\
right way, or manner, (S, Msb, K, TA,) that he<br>\
desired, (K, TA,) or the way, or manner, of his<br>\
acting [i. e. in which he should act], (TA,) to<br>\
perform, or accomplish, his, or the, affair: (S,<br>\
Msb, K, TA:) or he lacked power, strength, or<br>\
ability, for it; (MA, Mgh, * K, TA;) and was<br>\
unable to perform it, or execute it, thoroughly.<br>\
(K, TA.) [Hence,] one says, شِفَآءُ العِىِّالسُّؤَالُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [The remedy of inability is the asking information]. (TA in art. شفى.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And in like<br>\
manner one says, عَيَّ عَنْ حُجَّتِهِ, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
and عَيِىَ, aor. and inf. n. as above, i. e. He<br>\
found not the right way, or manner, of adducing<br>\
his argument, plea, or evidence. (Msb, TA. *)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And عَىَّ فِى مَنْطِقِهِ, (S, Msb,) and عَيِىَ, (S,<br>\

(Msb, K,) He found not the right way, or<br>\
manner, in his expressing of his ideas: (Msb:)<br>\
or i. q. حَصِرَ; (K;) or [nearly so, i. e.] عَيِىَ [or<br>\
عَىَّ] signifies he was, or became, unable to express<br>\
his mind, to say what he would, to find words to<br>\
express what he would say; he faltered in speech;<br>\
like حَصِرَ, except that the latter denotes what is<br>\
by reason of shame and confusion of mind, or<br>\
some [other] accidental cause: (TA in art. حصر,<br>\
from the Expos. of the “ Mufassal ” of Z:)<br>\
العِىُّ is the contr. of البَيَانُ [q. v.]: (S, TA:) or,<br>\
accord. to Er-Rághib, it is an inability that<br>\
ensues to one who has taken upon himself an affair<br>\
or a speech. (TA.) One says, جَآءَ بِالعِىِّ وَالشِّىِّ<br>\
[app. meaning He exhibited much impotence of<br>\
expression]; (S and K and TA in art. شوى;)<br>\
using the latter noun as an imitative sequent to<br>\
the former [for the purpose of corroboration].<br>\
(TA in that art.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَيِيتُهُ I was ignorant of<br>\
it: (K, TA:) originally meaning I was unable<br>\
to give information respecting it when asked, by<br>\
reason of ignorance of it. (TA.) One says, لَا<br>\
يَعْيَاهُ أَحَدٌ No one will be ignorant of it. (TA.)<br>\

not to be found; (K, TA;) making one&#39;s speech<br>\
enigmatical, or obscure; syn. إِلْغَازٌ: or doing a<br>\
deed to [the understanding of] the way, or<br>\
manner, of which the right direction is not to be<br>\
found. (TA.) One says, إِيّاكَ وَمَسَائِلَ المُعَايَاةِ<br>\
فَإِنَّهَا صَعْبَةُ المُعَانَاةِ [Avoid thou the questions of<br>\
enigmatical, or obscure, diction; for they are<br>\
difficult to be endured]: and عَايَاهُ, [He addressed<br>\
to him enigmatical, or obscure, speech, (like<br>\

behind with him], aor. يُعْيِى, and some incorporate [one ى into the other, transferring the<br>\
kesreh of the former ى to the ع], as is done in a<br>\
verse of El-Hotei-ah. (TA.)<br>\

meaning It disabled him, or incapacitated him,<br>\
from curing it: (K, * TA:) [or] one says of a<br>\
difficult disease, for which there is no cure, كَأَنَّهُ<br>\
أَعْيَا الأَطِبَّآءَ [It is as though it disabled, or incapacitated, the physicians; or frustrated their skill;<br>\
or baffled them]. (S, TA.) And a poet says,<br>\
(namely, &#39;Amr Ibn-Hassán, TA)<br>\
فَإِنَّ الكُثْرَ أَعْيَانِى قَدِيمًا<br>\
وَلَمْ أُقْتِرْ لَدُنْ أَنِّى غُلَامُ<br>\

of this art.:] and ↓ عَيَّانُ (K) and ↓ عَيَايَآءُ (S, K)<br>\
signify the same, (S, K,) in relation to an affair<br>\
and to the expression of one&#39;s ideas: (S:) the<br>\
pl. [of عَىٌّ] is أَعْيَآءٌ and [of عَيِىٌّ] أَعْيِيَآءُ; (S, K;)<br>\

the augmentative letters as rejected, (K, TA.) if<br>\
