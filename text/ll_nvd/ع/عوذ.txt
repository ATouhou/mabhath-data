is equivalent to the saying may God protect me,<br>\
or preserve me]: (S, A, O, L, K:) مَعَاذًا [as also<br>\
مَعَاذَةً] being here used instead of the verb because<br>\
it is an inf. n., though [accord. to some] not employed as such [in other cases], like as is the case<br>\
in the phrase سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ. (S, O, L.) [One says<br>\
also, مَعَاذَ اللّٰهِ أَنْ أَفْعَلَ كَذَا, for مِنْ أَنْ أَفْعَلَ كَذَا,<br>\
I seek preservation by God, &amp;c., from my doing<br>\
such a thing; as though meaning may God preserve me from doing such a thing: see an ex. in<br>\
the Kur xii. 79: and] some reckon مَعَاذَ اللّٰهِ among<br>\
the forms of oaths. (MF.) [In like manner also,]<br>\

of the etymologists, originally signifying an amulet, a phylactery, or a charm, upon which is [an<br>\
inscription commencing with the word] أَعُوذُ; and<br>\
afterwards applied in a general manner [as meaning any amulet]; (MF;) i. q. رُقْيَةٌ, (K,) or<br>\
تَمِيمَةٌ: (A:) or those who imagine that the<br>\
↓ مَعَاذَة is the same as the تميمة are in error; for<br>\
the latter is a bead: (Mgh in art. تم:) [in some<br>\
instances] the ↓ تَعْوِيذ is a thing made of silver,<br>\
of a round shape like the moon, but partly hollowed out in the form of the horse-shoe, tied by a<br>\

عُوَّذَا ↓ كَالطَّيْرِ يَنْجُونَ عِيَاذًا<br>\
[Like birds saving themselves, taking refuge in a<br>\

protection, or preservation, by Thee, &amp;c., seeking,<br>\
&amp;c., from every evil]: but accord. to Sb, in the phrase<br>\
عَائِذًا بِاللّٰهِ مِنْ شَرِّهَا, the word عائذا is put in the<br>\

or, as some say, it is a possessive epithet, meaning ذَاتُ عَوْذٍ: or, accord. to Az, a she-camel that has<br>\
brought forth some days before; accord. to some,<br>\
seven days: (L:) or a female gazelle, and a she-camel, and a mare, that has brought forth within<br>\

mistranscription for معوّد; by which he means<br>\
مُعَوِّد, part. n. of عَوَّدَ said of a camel; but this I<br>\
doubt; for مُعَوِّدٌ has not the meaning here assigned to معوّذ.] ―<br>\
