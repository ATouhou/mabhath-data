عَيْهَلْتُ الإِبلَِ I left the camels to pasture by themselves, without a pastor, by night and<br>\
by day: mentioned by IB, on the authority of<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd: and he cites as an ex.,<br>\
عَيْهَلَهَا الذُّوَّادُ ↓ عَيَاهِلُ<br>\
[app. meaning Camels left to pasture by themselves,<br>\
the drivers having left them to do so]. (TA.)<br>\
عَاهِلٌ A paramount sovereign, like a خَلِيفَة.<br>\
(S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A woman having no husband:<br>\
[probably because of her independence:] (AO, S,<br>\
O, K:) pl. عَوَاهِلُ. (O.)<br>\
عَيْهَلٌ A swift she-camel; as also هَيْهَلَةٌ; (S, O,<br>\
K;) and so ↓ عَيْهُولٌ and ↓ عَيْهَالٌ: (IDrd, * O, * K:)<br>\
or all signify an excellent, strong, she-camel: (K:)<br>\
or عَيْهَلٌ signifies a large, big, she-camel; or a tall<br>\
she-camel: (TA:) [see an ex. in a verse cited in<br>\
the first paragraph of art. جهم:] and it is also<br>\
applied to the male of camels, (K, TA,) as some<br>\
say; (TA;) and عَيْهَلَةٌ to the female; (K, TA;)<br>\
but, (TA,) accord. to AHát, one should not say<br>\
جَمَلٌ عَيْهَلٌ; (S, O, TA;) and some say that one<br>\
should apply to a she-camel the epithet عَيْهَلَةٌ<br>\
only: (TA:) sometimes, by poetic license, they<br>\
said عَيْهَلٌّ. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, applied to a man,<br>\
and عَيْهَلَةٌ applied to a woman, (K,) or both<br>\
applied to a woman, (S,) That will not remain<br>\
in one place, by reason of lightness, or unsteadiness, or lightwittedness, (S, K, TA,) going to and<br>\
fro, forwards and backwards. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
the former, A tall woman: (K, TA:) or a strong<br>\
woman. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَيْهَلَةٌ An old, aged,<br>\
woman. (O, K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And رِيحٌ عَيْهَلٌ A<br>\
strong, or violent, wind. (S, O, K. *) ―<br>\
-b6-  عَيَاهِلُ<br>\

عَيْهَلَةٌ,] see in the first paragraph.<br>\

عَيْهُولٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
