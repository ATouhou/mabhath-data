عَضَبَهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
عَضِبَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. عَضْبٌ, (S, A, O, &amp;c.,) He cut, or cut off,<br>\
him, or it. (S, A, * Mgh, * O, Msb, K.) مَا لَهُ<br>\
عَضَبَهُ اللّٰهُ, meaning [What aileth him?] may<br>\
God cut off (O, TA) his arm and his leg, or his<br>\
hand and his foot, (O,) or his arms and his legs,<br>\
or his hands and his feet, is a form of imprecation<br>\
used by the Arabs. (TA.) And hence, (O,) one<br>\
says, إِنَّ الحَاجَةَ لَيَعْضِبُهَا طَلَبُهَا قَبْلَ وَقْتِهَا (assumed tropical:)  Verily<br>\
the seeking of the object of want before its time<br>\
assuredly cuts it off, or precludes it, and mars it:<br>\
a prov. (O, TA.) And إِنَّكَ لَتَعْضِبُنِى عَنْ حَاجَتِى<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Verily thou cuttest me off from [the attainment<br>\
of] the object of my want. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[hence] (assumed tropical:)  He reviled him; (A, * K;) and (A) so<br>\
عَضَبَهُ بِلِسَانِهِ. (S, A, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He beat him,<br>\
or struck him, (O, K,) with a staff, or stick. (O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And He thrust him, or pierced him, (K,)<br>\
with a spear. (TK.) [But in the O and TA,<br>\
عَضَبْتُهُ بِالرُّمْحِ is expl. by the words هُوَ أَنْ تَشْغَلَهُ<br>\
عَنْهُ; and the meaning app. is, I occupied him so<br>\
as to divert him with the spear; though this<br>\
meaning would be expressed more agreeably with<br>\
usage by saying هو ان يشغله عنه; or rather هو<br>\
ان تَشْغَلَهُ عَنْكَ, which, I think, is the right reading.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And It (disease, O) rendered him weak,<br>\
or infirm: (S, O:) and (O) deprived him of the<br>\
power of motion. (A, * O, K.) You say, عَضَبَتْهُ<br>\
الزَّمَانَةُ, aor. as above, (O, TA,) and so the inf. n.,<br>\
(TA,) meaning [Disease of long continuance, or<br>\
want of some one or more of the limbs,] deprived<br>\
him of the power of motion: and AHeyth says,<br>\
it [in the O هُوَ (so that it does not refer to الزمانة),<br>\
and in the TA العضب,] is الشَّلَلُ and الخَبْلُ and<br>\
العَرَجُ [a state of privation of the power of motion,<br>\
and unsoundness, and lameness; app. meaning<br>\
that these are the effects denoted by the phrase<br>\
عضبته الزمانة]. (O, TA.) ―<br>\

O, Msb,) He, or she, had the inner [part of the]<br>\
horn broken: (S, O, Msb, K:) or had one of the<br>\
horns broken. (S, O, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  العَضَبُ is mostly<br>\
used in relation to the horn: but sometimes, in<br>\
relation to the ear: (A &#39;Obeyd, TA:) one says<br>\
of a شاة [expl. above], and of a she-camel,<br>\
عَضِبَت, inf. n. عَضَبٌ, meaning He, or she, had<br>\
her ear slit, or had a slit ear: (Msb:) [or had<br>\
