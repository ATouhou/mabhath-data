offence, of a man other than myself, and left him<br>\
like that which has the disease called عُرّ, another<br>\
than which is cauterized while he is pasturing at<br>\
pleasure]: he who says العَرّ, in relating this verse,<br>\

and goats, wild oxen, and the like,] and that of<br>\
birds; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ عُرٌّ: (O, K:) and<br>\

narcissus (النَّرْجِسُ البَرِّىُّ): (TA:) and said by<br>\
some to be a sort of tree [or plant] to which the<br>\
complexion of a woman is likened: (Ham p. 548:)<br>\
n. un. with ة: (S, O, K:) IAar says that the<br>\
عَرَارَة is like the بَهَار; having wood, [or arborescent,<br>\
app. meaning that it is the buphthalmum arborescens, the flower of which is intensely yellow,<br>\
agreeably with what is said of it in the O,]<br>\
having a sweet odour, and growing only in plain<br>\
land. (O.)<br>\

(K, TA:) of any such thing one says, هُوَ لَهُ عَرَارٌ<br>\
[It is one slain in retaliation for it]. (TA.)<br>\
[This latter meaning is app. taken from the prov.<br>\

غَرِيًّا, i. e. مُلْصَقًا [here meaning “ an adherent ”]:<br>\
but Hr and IAth agree with Az [and the S] and<br>\
Z and the [O and] K. (TA.)<br>\
عَرْعَرٌ The tree called سَرْو [which is the common,<br>\
or evergreen, cypress; but the former name is<br>\
generally applied in the present day to the<br>\
juniper-tree]; (S, O, K;) a Pers. word: (K:)<br>\
it is a kind of great tree, of the trees of the<br>\
mountains: (O:) some say that it is the [tree<br>\
called] سَاسَم, and also [said to be] called شِيزَى:<br>\
others, that it is a great kind of mountain-tree,<br>\
evergreen, called by the Persians سَرْو: (TA:)<br>\
AHn says that he had been informed by an Arab<br>\
of the desert, of the people of the Saráh (السَّرَاة),<br>\
who are possessors of the عَرْعَر, that it is the أَبْهَل<br>\
[q. v., a name now applied to the juniper-tree,<br>\
like عَرْعَر; and particularly to the species thereof<br>\
called the savin]; and he adds that he knew it<br>\
in his own country, and afterwards saw it in the<br>\
province of Kazween, cut for firewood from the<br>\
mountains thereof, in the borders of Ed-Deylem;<br>\
whence he knew that his informant was well<br>\
acquainted with it, for those mountains are places<br>\
of growth of the ابهل: (O:) he says that it has<br>\
a fruit like the نَبِق [or fruit of the lote-tree called<br>\
سِدْر], first green, then becoming white, then becoming black until it is like حُمَم [or charcoal, &amp;c.],<br>\

and عَرٌّ]. (TA.)<br>\
مَعَرَّةٌ A place of عَرّ, i. e. mange, or scab: this<br>\
is the primary signification. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
المَعَرَّةُ The region of the sky that is beyond the<br>\
Milky Way (المَجَرَّة) in the direction of the North<br>\
Pole; so called because of the multitude of the<br>\
stars therein; (O, * TA;) like as the sky is called<br>\
الجَرْبَآءُ because of its numerous stars; these being<br>\
compared to scabs on the body of a man: (TA:)<br>\
and to this and the مَجَرَّة a man alluded, when,<br>\
being asked respecting the place where he alighted<br>\
and abode, he informed the inquirer that he alighted<br>\
and abode between two tribes, (O, TA,) great and<br>\
numerous; (O;) saying, نَزَلْتُ بَيْنَ المَعَرَّةِ وَالمَجَرَّةِ<br>\
[I have alighted between the مَعَرَّة and the مَجَرَّة]:<br>\
(O, TA:) or, as some say, (O,) المَعَرَّةُ is the<br>\

from تَمَعَّرَ وَجْهُهُ, not from العَرُّ, it is without<br>\
