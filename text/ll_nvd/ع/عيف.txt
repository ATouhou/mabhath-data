عَافَهُ, aor. يَعَافَهُ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) and<br>\
يَعِيفُهُ, (Fr, O, K,) inf. n. عِيَافٌ, (S, Mgh, O,) or<br>\
عِيَافَةٌ, (Msb, [but probably a mistranscription for<br>\
the former,]) or both, or the latter is a simple<br>\
subst., and the former is an inf. n., also عَيْفٌ and<br>\
عَيَفَانٌ, (ISd, K,) He (a man, S, O, Msb, [and<br>\
any animal,]) disliked it, or loathed it, (S, Mgh,<br>\
O, Msb, K,) namely, food, (S, O, Msb, K,) or<br>\
water, (Mgh,) or beverage, (S, O, Msb, K,) and<br>\
would not drink it, (S, O, K,) and sometimes it<br>\
is said in relation to other things, (K,) but mostly<br>\
in relation to food: (ISd, TA:) and ↓ اِعْتَافَهُ<br>\
signifies the same as عَافَهُ. (TA.) A poet says,<br>\
(namely, Anas Ibn-Mudrik, O, TA, and so in<br>\
a copy of the S,)<br>\
إِنِّى وَقَتْلِى سُلَيْكًا ثُمَّ أَعْقِلُهُ<br>\
كَالثَّوْرِ يُضْرَبُ لَمَّا عَافَتِ البَقَرُ<br>\
[Verily I, in the case of my slaying Suleyk and<br>\
then giving the bloodwit for slaying him, am like<br>\
the bull that is beaten when the cows loathe the<br>\
water]: for when the cows hold back from entering into the water and drinking, they are not<br>\
beaten, because they have milk, but only the bull<br>\
is beaten, in order that they may be frightened,<br>\
and therefore drink. (S, O, TA. [See also the<br>\
Ham, p. 416; where the former hemistich is somewhat differently related.]) And hence the saying,<br>\
هٰذَا مِمَّا يَعَافُهُالطَّبْعُ [This is of the things that the<br>\
natural disposition dislikes, or loathes]. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  عِفْتُ الطَّيْرَ, aor. أَعِيفُهَا, inf. n. عِيَافَةٌ, I augured<br>\
from the birds, (S, O, K, TA,) good or evil, (O,<br>\
K, TA,) taking warning, or the like, by considering their names, and their places of alighting<br>\
(S, O, K, TA) and of passage, (TA,) and their<br>\
cries: thus, correctly, as in the T and S and M<br>\
and L, i. e. وَأَصْوَاتِهَا; for which the authors of<br>\
the O and K have substituted وَأَنْوَائِهَا, deceived<br>\
by the word مَسَاقِط in what goes before: and the<br>\
verb is used in like manner in relation to gazelles<br>\
or other animals passing with the right side, or<br>\
the left side, turned towards the spectator: (TA:)<br>\
العِيَافَةُ primarily signifies the man&#39;s throwing a<br>\
pebble at a bird, or crying out at it; and, if it<br>\
turn its right side towards him in flying, the<br>\
auguring good from it; and if its left side, evil:<br>\
(Har p. 308:) or, accord. to Az, it signifies the<br>\
seeing a bird, (TA,) or a raven, or crow, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) or the like, (Msb,) and auguring evil [or<br>\
good] therefrom: (Msb, TA:) and also the saying [a thing] conjecturally, or surmising; without<br>\
seeing anything: and it is said in a trad. to be<br>\
مِنَ الجِبْتِ [expl. in art. جبت]: the verb in<br>\
عِفْتُ الطَّيْرَ, as ISd says, is originally عَيِفْتُ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  عَافَتِ الطَّيْرُ, aor. تَعِيفُ, inf. n. عَيْفٌ,<br>\
(S, O, K,) is like عافت having for its aor,<br>\
تَعُوفُ and inf. n. عَوْفٌ, (K, TA,) i. e. (TA) The<br>\
birds circled over the water, or over carcasses or<br>\
corpses, and went to and fro, not going away,<br>\
desiring to alight. (S, O, TA. [See also art.<br>\
عوف.])<br>\
4<br>\
أَعَافُوا [They became in the condition of finding that] their beasts disliked, or loathed, the<br>\
water, and would not drink it. (ISk, O, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعيّف is probably used as signifying He<br>\
practised عِيَافَة, i. e. auguration from birds, &amp;c.<br>\
see its part. n., below.]<br>\
8<br>\
إِعْتَيَفَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-  Accord. to Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, (O,) اعتاف signifies He furnished himself with provisions for journeying. (O, K.)<br>\
عَيْفَةٌ is a term employed in the case when a<br>\
woman brings forth and her milk is suppressed<br>\
in her breast, wherefore her fellow-wife, or female<br>\
neighbour, draws it, by the single sucking and<br>\
the two suckings: (Nh, O, L, K, * TA: but in<br>\
the K, فَتَرْضِعُهَا is erroneously put for فَتَرْضِعُهُ;<br>\
and المَرَّةَ and المَرَّتَيْنِ are put for المَرَّةَ and<br>\
المَرَّتَيْنِ: TA:) thus in the saying of ElMugheereh, (O, K, TA,) as expl. by himself, (O,<br>\
TA,) لَا تُحَرِّمُ العَيْفَةُ [i. e. The woman&#39;s sucking<br>\
once and twice in drawing the breast of another<br>\
woman whose milk is suppressed after child-birth<br>\
will not render unlawful the marriage of either of<br>\
them to a relation of the other, nor the marriage<br>\
of a relation of either to a relation of the other;<br>\
as the case of regular or continued suckling of<br>\
a child does]: (O, K, TA: [but in the O and<br>\
CK, تُحَرَّمُ is erroneously put for تُحَرِّمُ: see a<br>\
similar saying voce مَزَّةٌ:]) the action is performed<br>\
in order that the obstructed channels by which<br>\
the milk issues may become opened: and it is<br>\
thus termed because the woman loathes it: (Az,<br>\
O, K:) A&#39;Obeyd says, We know not العَيْفَة in<br>\
sucking the breast, but think it to be العُفَّة: his<br>\
saying thus, however, is disapproved by Az.<br>\
(O, K, * TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَيْفَةٌ is also the subst. from<br>\
عَافَتِ الطَّيْرُ [q. v., app. signifying A circling of<br>\
birds over the water, &amp;c.]. (S, O, K.)<br>\
عِيفَةٌ A good thing: (O:) or the choice, or<br>\
best, or excellent, of camels or cattle or other<br>\
property: (K:) like عِيمَةٌ. (O, K.)<br>\
العَيَافُ and الطَّرِيدَةُ are Two games (Sh, O, K)<br>\
of the boys of the Arabs of the desert: (Sh, O:<br>\
[see the latter of these words:]) or the former is<br>\
what is called لُعْبَةُ الغُمَيْصَآءِ, or, as in some of the<br>\
copies of the K, الغُمَيْضَآءِ. (K, TA. [But I do<br>\
not find elsewhere الغُمَيْصَآء as the name of a game,<br>\
nor الغُمَيْضَآء in any sense.])<br>\
عَيُوفٌ: see عَائِفٌ. Applied to a camel, it means<br>\
That smells the water and then leaves it, though<br>\
thirsty. (S, O, K.)<br>\
عَيْفانٌ: see عَائِفٌ.<br>\
عَيَفَانٌ, like تَيَّهَانٌ, (O, K,) or عَيِّفَانٌ, like تَيِّهَانٌ,<br>\
(so in the CK,) One whose natural disposition,<br>\
(O, K,) and habit, or wont, (K,) it is to dislike,<br>\
or loathe, a thing. (O, K.)<br>\
عَائِفٌ Disliking, or loathing, food or beverage:<br>\
(S, TA:) and ↓ عَيُوفٌ and ↓ عَيْفَانٌ, applied to a<br>\
man, signify the same as عَائِفٌ [app. in this<br>\
sense: see an ex. of the former in a verse of Ibn-Mukbil cited voce سَوْفَ, last sentence]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Auguring, or divining, (S, O, K,) from birds<br>\
or other things. (O, K,) ―<br>\
-b2-  كَانَ عَائِفًا, said of<br>\
Shureyh, in a trad, of Ibn-Seereen, means He<br>\
was true in conjecture and opinion: like the<br>\
saying, of him who is right in his opinion, مَا هُوَ<br>\
إِلَّا كَاهِنٌ; and of him who is eloquent in his<br>\
speech, مَا هُوَ إِلَّا سَاحِرٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  طَيْرٌ عَائِفَةٌ Birds<br>\
circling over water, or over carcasses or corpses,<br>\
and going to and fro, not going away, desiring to<br>\
alight. (S, O.) And نُسُورٌ عَوَائِفُ [Vultures]<br>\
circling over the slain, and going to and fro.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَعِيفٌ, applied to food [and beverage], Disliked, or loathed. (Msb.)<br>\
مُتَعَيِّفٌ One who practises auguration from<br>\
birds [&amp;c.]. (Har p. 564.)<br>\
