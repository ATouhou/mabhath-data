Msb:) or ↓ اعمده, [and app. sometimes عَمَدَهُ,<br>\
(see مَعْمُودٌ,) and in a similar manner ↓ عمّدهُ is<br>\
expl. by Golius, as on the authority of J, whom<br>\
I do not find to have anywhere mentioned it, but<br>\
it is probably correct, (see its pass. part. n. in<br>\
this art.,)] he placed beneath it columns, pillars, or<br>\
props. (S, O. [See عَمُودٌ, &amp;c.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَمَدَهُ,<br>\

(Mtr, TA) and عُمُودٌ (Nawádir el-Aaráb, TA)<br>\
and مَعْمَدٌ; (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, TA;) and ↓ تعمّدهُ, (L,<br>\
Msb, K,) and لَهُ ↓ تعمّد; (S, L;) and ↓ اعتمدهُ;<br>\
(L, TA;) He intended it, or purposed it; did it<br>\
intentionally, or purposely; the inf. n. signifying<br>\
the contr. of خَطَأٌ: (Az, S, L, TA:) he directed<br>\
himself, or his course or aim, to it, or towards it;<br>\
made for it, or towards it; made it his object;<br>\
aimed at it; sought, or endeavoured, after it; or<br>\
tended, repaired, or betook himself, to it, or<br>\
towards it; syn. قَصَدَهُ; (L, K;) or قَصَدَ لَهُ, (S,<br>\

↓ اعتمدهُ; and ↓ تعمّدهُ; He betook himself to<br>\
him, or had recourse to him, in a case of need.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] one says, فَعَلْتُهُ عَمْدًا عَلَى<br>\
عَيْنٍ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and عَمْدَ عَيْنٍ, (S, A, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) I did it seriously, or in earnest, and<br>\
with certain knowledge, or assurance. (S, A, O,<br>\
Msb, K. [See also عَيْنٌ.]) When a man sees a<br>\
bodily form and imagines it to be an object of<br>\
the chase and therefore shoots at it, he cannot<br>\
use this phrase, for he only aims at what is an<br>\
object of the chase in his imagination: so says<br>\
Sgh. (Msb.)<br>\
-A3-  عَمَدَهُ, (S, O, L, K,) aor.<br>\
عَمِدَ, (L,)<br>\
said of disease, (S, O, L,) It pressed heavily upon<br>\
him, or oppressed him; (S, O, L, K;) on the<br>\
authority of IAar: (TA:) and so said of straitness, or confinement, or imprisonment, and captivity; (O;) and it caused him to fall; (O, K;)<br>\
in this sense in like manner said of confinement,<br>\
&amp;c.: (O:) also, (O, K,) said of a disease, (O,)<br>\
it pained him. (O, K.) And عَمَدَهُ, (K, TA,)<br>\
aor., in this case,<br>\
عَمُدَ, (TA, [but this, I think,<br>\
requires confirmation,]) It grieved him, or made<br>\
him sorrowful. (K, TA.) One says, مَا عَمَدَكَ<br>\
What has grieved thee, or made thee sorrowful?<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A4-  عَمِدَ, (S, O, L, K,) aor.<br>\
عَمَدَ, inf. n. عَمَدٌ,<br>\
(S, O,) said of earth, It became moistened by rain<br>\
so that when a portion of it was grasped in the<br>\
hand it became compacted by reason of its moisture:<br>\
(S, O, L, K:) or it became moistened by rain and<br>\
compacted, layer upon layer. (L.) And عَمِدَتِ<br>\
الأَرْضُ, inf. n. as above, The land became moistened<br>\
by the rain&#39;s sinking into the earth so that when<br>\
a portion of it was grasped in the hand it became<br>\
compacted by reason of its moisture. (AZ.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, (inf. n. as above, L,) said of a camel, He<br>\
had the inner part of his hump broken [or bruised]<br>\
by being [much] ridden, while the outer part remained whole, or sound: (S, O, L, K:) or he had<br>\
his hump swollen in consequence of the galling of<br>\
the saddle and the cloth beneath it, and broken [or<br>\
bruised]: whence عَمِيدٌ and مَعْمُودٌ as epithets<br>\
applied to a man. (L.) And عَمِدَتْ أَلْيَتَاهُ مِنَ<br>\
الرُّكُوبِ His buttocks became swollen, and quivered,<br>\
or throbbed, in consequence of [long and hard]<br>\
riding. (En-Nadr, O, K.) And عَمِدَ, aor. and<br>\
inf. n. as above, said of a pustule, It became<br>\
swollen in consequence of its having been squeezed<br>\
before it had become ripe, and its egg [or white<br>\
globule] did not come forth. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
He suffered pain. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And, (T, O, L, K,)<br>\
inf. n. as above, (T, L,) He was, or became,<br>\
angry: (T, O, L, K:) like عَبِدَ (T, L) [and أَمِدَ<br>\
and أَبِدَ]. One says, عَمِدَ عَلَيْهِ He was angry<br>\
with him. (T, L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [And He wondered.] One<br>\
says, أَنَا أَعْمَدُ مِنْهُ I wonder at him, or it: (S, O,<br>\
L, K:) or, as some say, I am angry at him, or<br>\
it: and some say that it means I lament at, or<br>\
complain of, him, or it. (L.) أَعْمَدُ مِنْ سَيِّدٍ قَتَلَهُ<br>\
قَوْمُهُ (S, O, L) i. e. Do I wonder at a chief whom<br>\
his [own] people have slain? (L) was said by<br>\
Aboo-Jahl (S, O, L) when he lay prostrated at<br>\
Bedr; meaning, hath anything more happened<br>\
than the slaughter of a chief by his [own] people?<br>\
this is not a disgrace [to him]: he meant thereby<br>\
that the destruction that befell him was a light<br>\
matter to him: (A&#39;Obeyd, L:) the saying is interrogative; (Sh, L;) أَعْمَدُ being app. contracted<br>\
from أَأَعْمَدُ, by the suppression of one of the two<br>\
hemzehs. (Az, L.) And أَعْمَدُ مِنْ كَيْلٍ مُحِّقَ,<br>\
as related by A&#39;Obeyd, [and thus in the O, in<br>\
two copies of the S written مُحِقّ, and in a third<br>\
copy omitted,] or مُحِقَ, without teshdeed, as<br>\
seen by Az written in an old book, [i. e. Do I<br>\
wonder at a measure incompletely filled?] is a<br>\
saying of the Arabs, expl. in the book above<br>\
alluded to, and, Az thinks, correctly, as meaning<br>\
is it anything more than a measure incompletely<br>\
filled? [and in a similar manner, but not so fully,<br>\
expl. in two copies of the S and in the O:] or,<br>\
accord. to IB, is it anything more than the fact<br>\
of my measure&#39;s being incompletely filled? (L:)<br>\
thus expl. also by ISk: and in a similar manner<br>\
the saying of Aboo-Jahl. (From a marginal note<br>\
in one of my copies of the S.) ―<br>\
-b6-  عَمِدَ بِهِ means<br>\
He kept, or clave, to it; (Ibn-Buzurj, O, K;)<br>\
namely, a thing. (O.)<br>\
2<br>\
عمّد السَّيْلَ, inf. n. تَعْمِيدٌ, He stopped, or<br>\
obstructed, the course of the torrent, so as to make<br>\
it collect in a place, by means of earth, (O, K,)<br>\
or the like, (K,) or stones. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, first<br>\
sentence. ―<br>\
-b3-  [عمّدهُ as used by the Christians, and<br>\
held to be of Syriac origin, means He baptized<br>\
him: see مَعْمُودِيَةٌ.]<br>\
4<br>\
أَعْمَدَ see 1, first sentence, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
أَعْمَدَتَاهُ رِجْلَاهُ occurs in a trad. as meaning His<br>\
legs rendered him عَمِيد, i. e. in such a state that<br>\
he could not sit unless propped up by cushions<br>\
placed at his sides: (L:) it is of the dial. of<br>\
Teiyi, who say in like manner أَكَلُونِى البَرَاغِيثُ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَعَمَّدَ see 1, former half, in five places.<br>\
7<br>\
انعمد It became stayed, propped up, or<br>\

اِعْتَمَدْتُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ I leaned, reclined, bore,<br>\
or rested, upon the thing; stayed, propped, or supported, myself upon it. (S, O, L, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\

in such a thing, or case; (S, O, L;) as also<br>\
اِعْتَمَدْتُهُ. (L.) And اعتمدت عَلَى الكِتَابِ [and<br>\
اعتمدت الكِتَابَ, and perhaps بِالكِتَابِ (see De<br>\
Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed., i. 315),] (tropical:)  I relied upon the book, and held to it: a metaphorical<br>\
phrase, from the first above. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence<br>\
also the phrase, used by grammarians, يَعْتَمِدُ عَلَى<br>\
مَا قَبْلَهُ (assumed tropical:)  It is syntactically dependent upon what<br>\
is before it; as, for instance, an enunciative upon<br>\
its inchoative, an epithet upon the subst. which it<br>\
qualifies, and an objective complement of a verb<br>\
upon its verb. ―<br>\
-b4-  اعتمد المَطَرُ عَلَى الأَرْضِ, a<br>\
phrase occurring in the K in art. نكح, app. means<br>\
The rain rested upon the ground so as to soak into<br>\
it: see عَمِدَ.] ―<br>\

journeyed, gently; went a gentle pace. (L in<br>\
art. هود.) And اعتمد لَيْلَتَهُ He rode on journeying during his night. (A, O, K.)<br>\

means قَصَدَهُ بِكَذَا i. e. He brought to him such a<br>\

with such a thing: see two exs. in the first paragraph of art. بى.]<br>\

portion of it is grasped in the hand it becomes<br>\
compacted by reason of its moisture: (S, O, L:)<br>\
or moistened by rain and compacted, layer upon<br>\
layer. (L.) ―<br>\

??ndant in goodness, beneficence, or<br>\
bounty. (AZ, Sh, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عَمِدٌ is also applied<br>\

مِنَ البَقَّارِ كَالعَمِدِ الثَّقَالِ<br>\
[And the torrent continued during the night, what<br>\
resembled the heavy, or slow-paced, camel such as<br>\
is termed عَمِد overlying its two sides, from the<br>\
valley of El-Bakkár]: As says, he means that a<br>\
collection of clouds resembling the [camel termed]<br>\
