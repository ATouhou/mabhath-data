عَلُ3َ (S, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
عَلِ3َ, (S, O, K,)<br>\
inf. n. عَلَلٌ (Msb, K) and عَلٌّ, (K,) He gave him<br>\
to drink the second time; (S, O, Msb, K;) and<br>\
so ↓ اعلّهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. إِعْلَالٌ. (TA.) [See<br>\
also 2 and 4.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, (assumed tropical:)  He dyed it a second<br>\
time; namely, a hide: see a verse cited voce<br>\
مُحْلِفٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence [also], (TA,) عَلَّ الضَّارِبُ<br>\
المَضْرُوبَ (tropical:)  The beater plied the beaten with a<br>\
continued beating; (S, O, K, TA;) and so عَلَّهُ<br>\
ضَرْبًا. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَطَآءُ اللّٰهِ مُضَاعَفٌ يَعُلُّ بِهِ<br>\
عِبَادَهُ مَرَّةً بَعْدَ أُخْرَى (assumed tropical:)  [The gift of God is<br>\
redoubled; He bestows it upon his servants one<br>\
time after another]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And عَلَّ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) or عَلَّ بِنَفْسِهِ, the verb being also intrans.,<br>\
(S, O,) aor.<br>\
عَلِ3َ (IAar, Msb, K) and<br>\
عَلُ3َ, (IAar, K,)<br>\
inf. ns. as above, (TK,) He drank (IAar, * S, O,<br>\
Msb, K) the second draught: (IAar, * S, O, K:)<br>\

عَلِ3َ, (IAar, Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
عَلٌّ, (TA,) He (a man, IAar, Msb) was, or became, diseased, sick, or ill; (IAar, Msb, K;) and<br>\
(Msb, K) so ↓ اعتلّ, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. اِعْتِلَالٌ;<br>\
(K;) and so عُلَّ, in the pass. form:<br>\
-A5-  and the<br>\
trans. verb is عَلَّهُ, [syn. with اعلّهُ,] aor. in this<br>\
case<br>\
عَلُ3َ. (Msb. See 4.)<br>\
-A6-  [عُلَّ الشَّىْءُ is mentioned in the S, with the addition ↓ فَهُوَ مَعْلُولٌ,<br>\
but without any explanation; perhaps as meaning The thing was caused; from عِلَّةٌ “ a cause,”<br>\
of which مَعْلُولٌ (q. v.) is the correlative: but the<br>\
context seems to indicate that it means the thing<br>\
was used for the purpose of diverting from some<br>\
want: Golius appears to have read عَلَّ, and to<br>\
have been led by what next precedes it in the S<br>\
to render it loco alterius rei fuit lactavitve res.]<br>\
2<br>\
تَعْلِيلٌ signifies The giving to drink after<br>\
giving to drink. (S.) See 4. [And see also 1,<br>\
first sentence.] ―<br>\

or food, &amp;c., (K, TA,) as, for instance, discourse,<br>\
and the like; (TA;) like as the child is diverted,<br>\
or occupied, with somewhat of food, by which he<br>\
is rendered contented to be restrained from milk.<br>\
(S, O, TA. *) One says, فُلَانٌ يُعَلِّلُ نَفْسَهُ بِتَعِلَّةٍ<br>\
[Such a one diverts, or occupies, himself, so as to<br>\
render himself contented, with something diverting].<br>\
(S, O.) [See also مُعَلِّلٌ. And see 5.]<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
The assigning a cause: and the asserting a cause.<br>\
(KL.) [One says, عللّٰهُ بِكَذَا He accounted for it<br>\
by assigning as the cause such a thing: and he<br>\
asserted it to be caused by such a thing.]<br>\
3<br>\
عَالَلْتُ النَّاقَةَ I milked the she-camel in the<br>\
morning and the evening and the middle of the<br>\
day: (Lh, O, TA:) in the K, erroneously, عَالَّتِ<br>\
النَّاقَةُ [as meaning the she-camel was milked at<br>\
those times]: (TA:) and the subst. is ↓ عِلَالٌ:<br>\
(K: [but there is no reason why this should not<br>\
be regarded as a reg. inf. n.:]) Lh cites this<br>\
verse, (O,) of an Arab of the desert, (TA,)<br>\
اَلْعَنْزُ تَعْلَمُ أَنِّى لَا أُكَرِّمُهَا<br>\
عَنِ العِلَالِ وَلَا عَنْ قِدْرِ أَضْيَافِى<br>\
[The she-goat knows that I will not preserve her<br>\
from the milking in the morning and the evening<br>\
and the middle of the day nor from the cookingpot of my guests]: (O:) or, accord. to Az, عِلَالٌ<br>\
signifies the milking after milking, before the udder<br>\
requires it by the abundance of the milk. (TA.)<br>\
[See also 6.]<br>\
4<br>\
أَعْلَلْتُ الإِبِلَ I brought, or sent, back the<br>\
camels from the water (S, O, K) after they had<br>\
satisfied their thirst, (O,) or before they had satisfied their thirst: (S, K:) or, (S, O, K,) [if the<br>\
latter is meant,] accord. to some of the etymologists, (S, O,) it is with غ; (S, O, K; [see 4 in<br>\
art. غل;]) as though it were from the meaning<br>\
of “ thirsting; ” but the former is what has been<br>\
heard; (S, O;) and it means I gave the camels to<br>\
drink the second draught, or watered them the<br>\
second time, and then brought them, or sent them,<br>\
back from the water, having their thirst satisfied;<br>\
and thus, too, means الإِبِلَ ↓ عَلَّلَتُ; the contr. of<br>\
أَغْلَلْنُهَا. (TA.) See also 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And اعلّ القَوْمُ The people, or party, were, or<br>\
became, persons whose camels had drunk the<br>\
second time. (S, O, K. *)<br>\
-A2-  اعلّهُ اللّٰهُ God caused<br>\
him to be diseased, sick, or ill; (Msb, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ عَلَّهُ, aor.<br>\
عَلُ3َ. (Msb.) One says, لَا أَعَلَّكَ اللّٰهُ,<br>\
meaning May God not smite thee with a disease,<br>\
a sickness, or an illness. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And اعلّهُ<br>\
signifies also He made him, or pronounced him,<br>\
to have an excuse (جَعَلَهُ ذَا عِلَّةٍ): whence إِعْلَالَاتُ<br>\
الفُقَهَآءِ [The excusings of the lawyers]. (Msb.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعلّل بِهِ He diverted himself, (S,) or occupied himself so as to divert himself, (K,) and (S,<br>\
in the K “ or ”) contented, or satisfied, himself, or<br>\
he was, or became diverted, &amp;c., with it; (S, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ اعتلّ: (K:) as, for instance, with a portion of food, [so that the craving of his stomach<br>\
became allayed,] before the [morning-meal called]<br>\
غَدَآء; (M voce سُلْفَةٌ, and K voce لُمْجَةٌ, &amp;c.;)<br>\
and as a beast does with the cud: (TA:) he<br>\
occupied himself so as to divert himself, and fed<br>\
[or sustained] himself, with it: (Har p. 23:) and<br>\
he whiled away his time with it. (W p. 55.) And<br>\
تعلّل بالْمَرْأَةِ He diverted himself with the woman.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تعلّل signifies also He occupied<br>\
himself vainly. (S and TA in art. جدب: see a<br>\
verse cited voce جَادِبٌ.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He made an<br>\
excuse. (KL. [See also 8.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  And تَعَلَّلَتْ مِنْ<br>\
نِفَاسِهَا, and ↓ تَعَالَّتْ, (K, TA,) as also تَعَالَتْ,<br>\
without teshdeed, (TA, [see 5 in art. علو,]) She<br>\
passed forth from her state of impurity consequent<br>\
upon childbirth, (K, * TA,) and became lawful to<br>\
her husband. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
هُوَ يَتَعَالُّ نَاقَتَهُ means He milks the عُلَالَة<br>\
[q. v.] of his she-camel. (TA. [See also 3.])<br>\
And الصَّبِىُّ يَتَعَالُّ بِثَدْىِ أُمِّهِ [perhaps correctly<br>\
ثَدْىَ أُمِّهِ, and app. meaning The child exhausts<br>\
the عُلَالَة, or remains of milk, in the breast of his<br>\
mother]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تَعَالَلْتُ النَّاقَةَ (assumed tropical:)  I<br>\
elicited from the she-camel what power she had<br>\
[remaining] of going on. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And تَعَالَلْتُ<br>\
نَفْسِى signifies the same as تَلَوَّمْتُهَا [app. meaning<br>\
I waited for myself to accomplish a want, or an<br>\
object of desire, so that I might avoid blame:<br>\
for تَلَوَّمَ as signifying اِنْتَظَرَ and تَنَظَّرَ is trans. as<br>\
well as intrans.; and seems to be originally similar to تَأَثَّمَ and تَحَنَّثَ &amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See<br>\
also 5, last sentence.<br>\
8<br>\
اعتلّ: see 1, latter half. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, اعتلّت<br>\
الرِّيحُ (assumed tropical:)  The wind became faint, or feeble.]<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also 5, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He excused himself; or adduced, or urged, an excuse, or a plea;<br>\
(MA, K, * TA; *) or he laid hold upon a plea, or<br>\
an allegation. (El-Fárábee, Msb.) You say, اعتلّ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ بِعِلَّةٍ (S, MA, O) He adduced, or urged, an<br>\
excuse, or a plea, or pretext, for it. (MA.)<br>\
And hence, اِعْتِلَالَاتُ الفُقَهَآءِ [The pleas, or allegations, of the lawyers, which they adduce, or<br>\
upon which they lay hold]. (Msb.)<br>\
-A3-  اعتلّهُ He<br>\
hindered, prevented, impeded, or withheld, him;<br>\
turned him back or away; retarded him; or<br>\
diverted him by occupying him otherwise; from<br>\
an affair. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (S, O, in the K “ or ”)<br>\
He accused him of a crime, an offence, or an<br>\
injurious action, that he had not committed.<br>\
(S, O, K.)<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَعَلْعَلَ He, or it, was, or became,<br>\
unsteady, or shaky, and lax, or uncompact. (K.)<br>\
عَلْ and لَعَلْ and عَلْكَ and لَعَلْكَ: see عَلَّ, below.<br>\
-A2-  عَلْ عَلْ (K, TA, in the O written as one word,)<br>\
A cry by which one chides sheep or goats (Yaakoob,<br>\
O, K) and camels. (O.)<br>\
عَلُ: see art. علو.<br>\
عَلَّ and لَعَلَّ (S, O, Mughnee, K) are dial. vars.;<br>\
or the former is the original, the ل being augmentative, (S, O, Mughnee,) prefixed for the purpose<br>\
of corroboration: the meaning is expectation of<br>\
a thing hoped for or feared; (S, O;) importing<br>\
hope, or eager desire, and fear, or caution: (S,<br>\
O, K:) each is a particle, like إِنَّ and لَيْتَ and<br>\
كَأَنَّ and لٰكِنَّ: (S, O:) and like عَسَى [q. v.] in<br>\
meaning; but like إِنَّ in government; (Mughnee;)<br>\
governing the subject in the accus. case, and the<br>\
predicate in the nom.: one says, عَلَّكَ تَفْعَلُ [Maybe, or perhaps, thou wilt do such a thing], and<br>\
عَلِّى أَفْعَلُ [May-be I shall do], and لَعَلِّى أَفْعَلُ;<br>\
and sometimes they said, عَلَّنِى and لَعَلَّنِى; (S,<br>\
O;) and one says also ↓ عَلْ and ↓ لَعَلْ, with the<br>\
ل quiescent, and ↓ عَلْكَ and ↓ لَعَلْكَ: (O:) [and<br>\
accord. to general usage, one says, لَعَلَّ زَيْدًا قَائِمٌ<br>\
May-be Zeyd is standing:] and the tribe of<br>\
&#39;Okeyl made each to govern the subject in the<br>\
gen. case, (S, O, Mughnee,) saying, لَعَلَّ زَيْدٍ قَائِمٌ;<br>\
(S, O;) and allowed the pronouncing عَلِّ and<br>\
لَعَلِّ: (Mughnee:) sometimes its subject is suppressed, as in عَلَّ أَنْ أَتَقَدَّمَ, meaning لَعَلَّنِى أَنْ<br>\
أَتَقَدَّمَ [May-be I shall precede]: (Ham p. 517:)<br>\
the Koofees allow the mansoob aor. [immediately]<br>\
after, on the authority of the reading of Hafs, [in<br>\
the Kur xl. 38,] لَعَلِّى أَبْلُغَ الأَسْبَابَ [May-be I<br>\
may reach the places of ascent, or the regions, or<br>\
tracts, of the heavens]. (Mughnee.) Other dial.<br>\
vars. of عَلّ are mentioned in art. لعل [q. v.]. (K.)<br>\
عَلٌّ: see عَلَلٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also [in the<br>\
CK erroneously with damm to the ع in all the<br>\
senses here following that are expl. in the K] An<br>\
emaciated tick: (S, O:) or a big-bodied tick: or<br>\
a small-bodied one: (K, TA:) pl. عِلَالٌ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And A man advanced in age, (S, O, K,)<br>\
small in body, (S, O,) or slender, or spare; (K;)<br>\
as being likened to the tick. (S, O.) And anything slender (دَقِيق, for رَقِيق in the K is a mistranscription, TA) in body, advanced in age.<br>\
(M, K, * TA.) And A man whose skin is contracted by disease. (IDrd, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also One<br>\
in whom is no good: Esh-Shenfarà says, وَلَسْتُ<br>\
بِعَلٍّ [And I am not one in whom is no good: but<br>\
the context seems rather to require one of the<br>\
other meanings mentioned above: and another<br>\
reading (بِفِلٍّ) is mentioned by De Sacy, in his<br>\
Chrest. Ar., 2nd ed., ii. 359]. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also<br>\
A man who visits women much, or often, (K, TA,)<br>\
and diverts himself with them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And A<br>\
big-bodied, large he-goat. (K.)<br>\
عُلٌّ and عِلٌّ: see عُلْعُلٌ.<br>\
عَلَّةٌ A [single] second draught. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
hence, (Mgh,) A woman&#39;s fellow-wife; her husband&#39;s wife: (Mgh, Msb, * K:) or, as some say,<br>\
a step-mother: but the former is the more correct<br>\
meaning: (Mgh:) pl. عَلَّاتٌ. (Msb.) Whence,<br>\
بَنُو العَلَّاتِ The sons of one father by different<br>\
mothers: as though, when he added by marriage<br>\
a second wife to the first, he took a second<br>\
draught. (S, * Mgh, O, * Msb, * K. *) أَوْلَادُ الأَخْيَافِ<br>\
means the contr. of this: and أَوْلَادُ الأَعْيَانِ, the<br>\
sons of the same father and mother. (Msb.)<br>\
Accord. to IB, one says, هُمَا أَخَوَانِ مِنْ ضَرَّتَيْنِ<br>\
[They two are brothers from two fellow-wives];<br>\
but they did not say, مِنْ ضَرَّةٍ: and accord. to<br>\
ISh, one says, هُمْ بَنُو عَلَّةٍ and أَوْلَادُ عَلَّةٍ. (TA.)<br>\
And it is said in a trad., الأَنْبِيَآءُ بَنُو عَلَّاتِ, (Mgh,)<br>\
or أَوْلَادُ عَلَّاتٍ, (TA,) meaning The prophets are<br>\
of different mothers, but of one religion: (T, Mgh,<br>\
TA:) or of one faith, but of different religious<br>\
laws or ordinances. (Nh, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also عُلَالَةٌ.<br>\
عِلَّةٌ An accident that befalls an object and<br>\
causes its state, or condition, to become altered.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (TA,) A disease, sickness,<br>\
or malady; (S, O, K, TA;) because, by its befalling, the state becomes altered from strength<br>\
to weakness; so says El-Munáwee in the “ Tow-<br>\
keef: ” (TA:) or a disease that diverts [from the<br>\
ordinary occupations; app. regarded as being<br>\
from what next follows]: pl. عِلَلٌ (Msb) [and<br>\
عِلَّاتٌ]. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also An accident, or event, that diverts<br>\
the person to whom it occurs from his course, (S,<br>\
O, K,) or from the object of his want: (M:) as<br>\
though it became a second occupation hindering<br>\
him from his former occupation. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
[hence,] an excuse; an apology; a plea whereby<br>\
one excuses himself. (TA.) Hence, (K, * TA,)<br>\
لَاتَعْدَمُ خَرْقَآءُ عِلَّةً [expl. in art. خرق]. (K, TA.)<br>\
[See also another ex. in art. سأل, conj. 3.] ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And A cause: [and particularly an efficient<br>\
cause:] (M, K:) one says, هٰذَا عِلَّةٌ لِهٰذَا This<br>\
is a cause of this: (M:) and هٰذِهِ عِلَّتُهُ This is<br>\
its cause: (K:) [and ↓ عِلَّةٌ وَمَعْلُولٌ Cause and<br>\
effect; a phrase of frequent occurrence in theological and other works:] and [sometimes عِلَّةٌ<br>\
signifies a pretext, or pretence:] it is said in a<br>\
trad. of &#39;Áïsheh, فَكَانَ عَبْدُ الرَّحْمٰنِ يَضْرِبُ رِجْلِى<br>\
بِعِلَّةِ الرَّاحِلَةِ, meaning And &#39;Abd-Er-Rahmán<br>\
was beating my leg with the pretence, or pretext,<br>\
of his beating the side of the camel with his leg.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  The phrase عَلَى عِلَّاتِهِ means In every<br>\
case. (S, O, K.) Zubeyr says,<br>\
إِنَّ البَخِيلَ مَلُومٌ حَيْثُ كَانَ وَاٰ<br>\
كِنَّ الجَوَادَ عَلَى عِلَّاتِهِ هَرِمُ<br>\
[Verily the niggard is blamed wherever he be; but<br>\
the liberal in all his circumstances is Herim]: (S,<br>\
O:) meaning his companion Herim Ibn-Sinán<br>\
El-Murree. (S in art. هرم.)<br>\
عَلَلٌ and ↓ عَلٌّ [both mentioned in the first<br>\
paragraph as inf. ns.] The second draught: or a<br>\
drinking after drinking, uninterruptedly: (K:) or<br>\
the former signifies a second drinking; one says<br>\
عَلَلٌ بَعْدَ نَهَلٍ [a second drinking after a first<br>\
drinking]: (S, O:) or a drinking after drinking:<br>\
(Msb:) and the second watering of camels; the<br>\
first being termed the نَهَل: (As, TA:) these two<br>\
terms are also similarly used in relation to suckling: and one of the unknown poets says,<br>\
ثُمَّ انْثَنَى مِنْ بَعْدِ ذَا فَصَلَّى<br>\
↓ عَلَى النَّبِىِّ نَهَلًا وَعَلَّا<br>\
[Then he turned, or turned away or back, after<br>\
that, and blessed the Prophet a first time and a<br>\
second time]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, the former, Food<br>\
that has been eaten. (Kr, TA.) [See also نَهَلٌ.]<br>\
عُلُلٌ: see عُلْعُلٌ.<br>\
عِلَالٌ: see 3; of which it is said in the K to<br>\
be the subst., though app. the inf. n.<br>\
عَلُولٌ Some light food with which the sick person<br>\
is diverted or occupied [so as to be rendered contented]: pl. عُلُلٌ. (TA.)<br>\
عَلِيلٌ Diseased, sick, or ill; (S, Msb;) and so<br>\
with ة applied to a woman: (Mgh:) or, the<br>\
former, rendered diseased &amp;c. by God; [being<br>\
used as the pass. part. n. of أَعَلَّهُ in the phrase<br>\
اعلّهُ اللّٰهُ;] (K;) as also ↓ مُعَلٌّ, (Msb, K,) agreeably with rule, but this is seldom used; (Msb;)<br>\
and ↓ مَعْلُولٌ, from عَلَّهُ اللّٰهُ; (Msb;) or this last<br>\
should not be said, for, though the theologians<br>\
say it, it is not of established authority. (K, *<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَلِيلَةٌ also signifies A woman perfumed<br>\
repeatedly: (AA, O, K, TA:) and accord. to AA,<br>\
↓ مُعَلَّلٌ, as used in a verse of Imra-el-Keys, signifies perfumed time after time. (O.) [See also<br>\
مُعَلِّلٌ.]<br>\
عُلَالَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ تَعِلَّةٌ (S, * K) and ↓ عَلَّةٌ,<br>\
(K, TA,) with fet-h, (TA, [in the CK العِلَّةُ is<br>\
put for العَلَّةُ,]) A thing with which a person, (S,<br>\
K,) or a child, (TA,) is diverted, or occupied so<br>\
as to be diverted, and contented, or satisfied, (S,<br>\
K, TA,) such as talk, and singing, and food, &amp;c.,<br>\
(Har p. 308,) [or such as a small quantity of<br>\
food by which the craving of his stomach is<br>\
allayed,] in order that he may be quiet. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., accord. to different relations<br>\
thereof, that dates are the ↓ تَعِلَّة of the child or<br>\
of the guest. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, the first, accord.<br>\
to the copies of the K, What is drawn from the<br>\
udder after the first فِيقَة: but accord. to IAar,<br>\

milkings], and before the second فيقة collects: also<br>\
termed عُرَاكَةٌ and دُلَاكَةٌ: (TA:) [or] the milking that is between two milkings: (S, O:) [or] it<br>\
signifies also the middle milking of the camel that<br>\
is milked in the first part and the middle and the<br>\
last part of the day: (K:) or, as some say, the<br>\
milk that she excerns [into her udder] after the<br>\
milking of the copious flow thereof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And A remaining portion of milk (S, O, K, TA)<br>\
in the udder: (TA:) and (assumed tropical:)  of other things: [for<br>\
instance,] (tropical:)  of the course [of a beast]: (K:) (tropical:)  of<br>\
the running of a horse; (S, O, TA;) the former<br>\
portion whereof is termed بُدَاهَةٌ: (TA:) and (assumed tropical:)  of<br>\
anything: (S, K:) as (tropical:)  of the flesh of a sheep or<br>\
goat: and (tropical:)  of the strength of an old man. (TA.)<br>\
عُِلِّىٌّ: see the next paragraph, in three places.<br>\

chamber; syn. غُرْفَةٌ: pl. عَلَالِىُّ. (S, O, K.) [It<br>\
is mentioned also in art. علو, q. v.] ―<br>\
-b2-  هُوَ مِنْ<br>\
عِلِّيَّةِ قَوْمِهِ and عُلِّيَّتِهِمْ, [both mistranscribed in the<br>\
CK,] and عِلْيَتِهِمْ, without teshdeed, [which belongs<br>\

↓ عِلِّىٌّ, or عِلِّيَّةٌ or عُلِّيَّةٌ, or a pl. having no sing.,<br>\
(K, TA,) [or rather it is from the Hebr.<br>\
עֶלְיוֹן<br>\
signifying “ high,” or “ higher,”] and is said to<br>\
be A place in the Seventh Heaven, to which ascend<br>\
the souls of the believers: or the most elevated of<br>\
the Paradises; like as سِجِّين is the most elevated<br>\
of the places of the fires [of Hell]: or rather it is<br>\
properly a name of the inhabitants thereof; for<br>\
this [sort of] pl. is peculiar to rational beings:<br>\
(TA:) it is mentioned again in art. علو [in which<br>\
see other explanations]. (K, TA.)<br>\
عَلَّانٌ Ignorant: (O, K:) so in the saying, أَنَا<br>\
عَلَّانٌ بِأَرْضِ كَذَا وَكَذَا [I am ignorant of such<br>\
and such a land]: (O:) and so, with ة, applied<br>\
to a woman: (O, K:) mentioned by Aboo-Sa&#39;eed,<br>\

the extremity of the rib that impends over the رَهَابَة,<br>\
which is the extremity of the stomach: pl. علل<br>\

Verily he is in a state of fighting, or conflict, and<br>\
commotion, or tumult. (Fr, O.) [See also زُلْزُولٌ.]<br>\
عَالَّةٌ and [its pls.] عَوَالُّ and عَلَّى epithets applied to camels [as meaning Taking, or having<br>\
taken, a second draught; and so the first applied<br>\
to a single she-camel]. (TA.) It is said in a<br>\
prov., عَرَضَ عَلَىَّ سَوْمَ عَالَّةٍ [He offered to me in<br>\
the manner of offering water to those (camels)<br>\
taking, or having taken, a second draught]; (S,<br>\
O, K, TA; in the CK, عُرِضَ and سَوْمُ;) applied<br>\
to one who offers food to him who does not need<br>\
it; like the saying of the vulgar, عَرْضَ سَابِرِىٍّ;<br>\
(TA;) i. e., without energy; for one does not<br>\
offer drink to the عالّة with energy, as one does<br>\
to the نَاهِلَة [or those taking, or having taken,<br>\
the first draught]. (S, O, K, TA. [See also<br>\
Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 84.])<br>\

who sucks it in [when kissing]; thus in a verse of<br>\
Imra-el-Keys, accord. to one relation thereof;<br>\
(O, and Har p. 566;) as expl. by Az; and thus,<br>\
with ة, applied to a female: (Har:) but accord.<br>\
to IAar, that aids with kindness after kindness<br>\
(بِالْبِرِّ بَعْدَ البِرِّ [in Har على البرء بعد البرء]): another reading of the word in that verse, المُعَلَّل,<br>\

of AA. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Plucking fruit time after<br>\
time. (K.) ―<br>\

one portion following another: (As, O, K, TA:)<br>\
or, accord. to Suh, in the R, [simply] a pool of<br>\
water left by a torrent; so called because it<br>\
waters the ground a second time (يَعُلُّ الأَرْضَ بِمَائِهِ<br>\
[after its having been watered by the rain]): pl.<br>\
يَعَالِيلُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A dye (صِبْغ) that is imbided (عُلَّ) one time after another: (O, K:) or,<br>\
accord. to &#39;Abd-El-Lateef El-Baghdádee, a garment, or piece of cloth, dyed, and dyed again.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Accord. to AA, [app. as applied to<br>\
camels,] يَعَالِيلُ signifies That have drunk one<br>\
time after another; and has no sing.: but it is<br>\
said on other authority to signify that go away at<br>\
random to pasture (اَلَّتِى تَهْمِى) one time after<br>\

another; (S, O;) sing. as above: (S:) or [simply] clouds; so in the R; to which ISd adds containing rain: (TA:) or white clouds; (K, TA;<br>\

phrase بِيضٌ يَعَالِيلُ in a verse of Kaab Ibn-Zuheyr<br>\
to which reference has been made above: (TA:)<br>\
or [the sing. signifies] a white portion of clouds.<br>\
