you say, عَلَا فِى المَكَانِ [it was, or became, high,<br>\

elevated, or exalted, in dignity, or nobility], (S,<br>\
Mgh,) with kesr, (S,) aor. يَعْلَى, inf. n. عَلَآءٌ; (S,<br>\

poet says,<br>\
لَمَّا عَلَا كَعْبُكَ لِى عَلِيتُ<br>\

became exalted]; thus combining the two dial.<br>\

copies of the K عَلًا]; (Msb, K;) and عَلَا, inf. n.<br>\
عُلُوٌّ; (K;) and thus the two verbs are used in<br>\
the saying of the poet cited above: (TA:) and<br>\
↓ استعلى, said of a man, signifies the same as<br>\
عَلَا. (S.) [Hence,] عَلَتِ الشَّمْسُ The sun became<br>\
high; as also ↓ اِعْتَلَت: (Nawádir el-Aaráb, TA<br>\
in art. دلك:) and [hence,] عَلَا النَّهَارُ The day became advanced, the sun being somewhat high; syn.<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  عَلَا فِى المَكَانِ, inf. n. عُلُوٌّ, signifies [also] He ascended the place, or upon the place; syn. صَعِدَ: and<br>\
عَلَوْتُ عَلَى الجَبَلِ and عَلَوْتُ أَعْلَاهُ are syn. [as meaning I ascended the mountain, or upon the mountain,<br>\

last [for which the CK has عالاهُ] being with<br>\
teshdeed, (TA,) and ↓ عالاهُ and بِهِ ↓ عالى, (K,<br>\
TA, [in the CK عالَّاهُ وبه,]) are syn., (S, K,) signifying He ascended it, or upon it; (K; [in the<br>\
CK صَعَّدَهُ, and so in my MS. copy of the K, but<br>\
in other copies صَعِدَهُ, which is certainly the right<br>\
reading;]) whether the object be a mountain or a<br>\
beast: (TA:) [or] you say, عَلَا الدَّابَّةَ He<br>\
mounted the beast; (K, TA;) and in like manner,<br>\
anything: (TA:) and عَلَى السَّطْحَ, aor. يَعْلِيهِ;<br>\
(K, TA;) but in the M عَلِىَ السَّطْحَ, i. e., like<br>\
رَضِىَ; (TA;) inf. n. عَلْىٌ (K, TA) and عِلْىٌ<br>\
(TA, and so accord. to some copies of the K,)<br>\
and عُلِىٌّ; (TA, and so accord. to other copies of<br>\
the K instead of عِلْىٌ;) He ascended upon the flat<br>\
house-top; syn. صَعِدَهُ. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [عَلَاهُ signifies also He, or it, was, or became, upon it, or<br>\
over it: and it came, or arose, upon it; overlay<br>\
it; was, or became, superincumbent, or supernatant, upon it; or overspread it; as scum, and<br>\
rust, &amp;c. And It lay on him as a burden.<br>\
Hence,] one says, مَا سَأَلْتُكَ مَا يَعْلُوكَ ظَهْرًا i. e.<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  I did not ask, or demand, of thee, what would<br>\
lie as a burden on thy back; or] what would be<br>\
onerous, burdensome, oppressive, or troublesome, to<br>\
thee. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And [hence also] عَلَاهُ It over-<br>\
topped it, rose above it, or exceeded it in height.<br>\
(TA in art. دصر.) [And in like manner, ↓ استعلى<br>\
عَلَيْهِ It became elevated above it.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And عَلَوْتُهُمْ<br>\
بِالشَّرَفِ and بِالجَمَالِ [(assumed tropical:)  I was, or became, superior<br>\
to them in nobility and in goodliness]. (S in art.<br>\
فرع.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And عَلَاهُ [(assumed tropical:)  He had, or gained, ascendency over him, or it; as also عَلَا عَلَيْهِ and<br>\
عليه ↓ استعلى: and] (assumed tropical:)  he overcame him; or had,<br>\
or gained, the mastery over him; (S, Msb, TA;)<br>\
and subdued him; (Msb;) namely, his opponent,<br>\
or adversary; as also ↓ استعلاهُ: and in like manner, عَلَا حَاجَتَهُ and ↓ استعلاها (assumed tropical:)  he gained the<br>\
mastery over the object of his want: and ↓ اعتلى<br>\
الشَّىْءَ (assumed tropical:)  he prevailed against the thing, or had<br>\
power over it, and overcame it; and عَلَا لِلشَّىْءِ,<br>\
aor. يَعْلُو, (assumed tropical:)  he was, or became, able to do, or<br>\
accomplish, or to bear, the thing. (TA.) عَلَا<br>\
بِالأَمْرِ means اِضْطَلَعَ بِهِ وَاسْتَقَلَّ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He had<br>\
strength, or power, sufficient for the affair, and<br>\
had absolute control over it]: (S: [so in one of<br>\
my copies: the other has اِطَّلَعَ, which I find also<br>\
in the PS and in my copy of the TA; and which<br>\
is allowed by some, but disallowed by others, in<br>\
the sense of اِضْطَلَعَ, as is shown voce مُضْطَلِعٌ:])<br>\
a poet says,<br>\
فَاعْمِدْ لِمَا تَعْلُو فَمَا لَكَ بِالَّذِى<br>\
لَا تَسْتَطِيعُ مِنَ الأُمُورِ يَدَانِ<br>\
[Then aim thou at that for which thou hast sufficient strength, or power, and over which thou hast<br>\
absolute control: (بِهِ being understood after تعلو:)<br>\
for what object hast thou in meddling with that<br>\
which a pair of hands cannot accomplish, of<br>\
affairs?]. (S.) [And hence, perhaps,] one says<br>\
to him who possesses much property, اعل به i. e.<br>\
ابق بعده [app. اُعْلُ بِهِ and اِبْقَ بَعْدَهُ, as though<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Have thou ability to consume it, and<br>\
so survive thou it; like as one says to him who<br>\
puts on a new garment, أَبْلِ (see 4 in art. بلو)]:<br>\
or [perhaps a mistake for “ and ”] it is [virtually]<br>\
a prayer for his continuance in life. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
عَلَوْتُ عَلَى فُلَانٍ الرِّيحَ means I was [or went] on<br>\
the windward side of such a one: and one says,<br>\
لَا تَعْلُ الرِّيحَ عَلَى الصَّيْدِ فَيَرَاحَ رِيحَكَ وَيَنْفِرَ [i. e.<br>\
Go not thou on the windward side of the game,<br>\
lest it scent thy odour, and take fright and flee].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  عَلَوْتُهُ بِالسَّيْفِ means I smote him [with<br>\
the sword; or, more properly, I set upon him<br>\
therewith]. (S, TA.) And [in like manner] one<br>\
says, عَلَاهُ بِالشَّتْمِ وَالضَّرْبِ [(assumed tropical:)  He set upon him, or<br>\
assailed him, or overcame him, with reviling and<br>\
beating]. (S and M in art. ثول, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b9-  عَلَا فِى<br>\
الأَرْضِ, (S, TA,) inf. n. عُلُوٌّ, (S,) signifies (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
exalted, or magnified, himself, [in the earth,] or<br>\
behaved proudly, insolently, or exorbitantly. (S, *<br>\
TA.) And [in like manner] لَا تَعْلُوا عَلَى اللّٰهِ, in<br>\
the Kur xliv. 18, (assumed tropical:)  Exalt not, or magnify not,<br>\
yourselves against God; or behave not proudly,<br>\
&amp;c. (Bd, Jel.) ―<br>\
-b10-  عَلَا عَنْهُ [lit. signifies It rose<br>\
from it: and hence,] it recoiled from it, i. e., a<br>\
thing from another thing; it did not cleave to it:<br>\
and تَعْلُو عَنْهُ العَيْنُ means (assumed tropical:)  The eye recoils from<br>\
him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  اُعْلُ عَنِّى: see 3. ―<br>\
-b12-  عَلَا بِهِ as<br>\
syn. with أَعْلَاهُ: see expl. with the latter below.<br>\
2<br>\
علّاهُ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, عَلَّيْتُ<br>\
بِهِ عَلَى البَعِيرِ [I raised it, and put it, upon the<br>\
camel]: (S:) [and so ↓ عَالَيْتُهُ; as in a verse cited<br>\
voce رَائِحٌ, in art. روح; in which, and in the present art., it is cited in the S and TA: and ↓ عَالَبْتُ<br>\
بِهِ; as in a verse cited voce إِلَى in the sense of<br>\
مِنْ, in art. الو:] and عَلَىَّ ↓ عَالِ means اِحْمِلْ<br>\
[i. e. Put thou upon me such a thing to be carried<br>\
by me; or load thou me]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَلَّيْتُ<br>\
الحَبْلَ, inf. n. تَعْلِيَةٌ, I raised the cord to its proper place in respect of the channel of the sheave,<br>\
and in respect of the [main] well-rope. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And علّى الدَّلْوَ, inf. n. as above, He raised the<br>\
bucket from a stone projecting in the lower part<br>\
of the casing of a well [and impeding its ascent];<br>\
he having descended the well for that purpose: [or<br>\
simply he raised the filled bucket; for] some say<br>\
that ↓ المُعَلِّىsignifies he who raises the filled<br>\
bucket; i. e., who draws water thereby. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And علّى المَتَاعَ عَنِ الدَّابَّةِ He put down the<br>\
goods, or furniture and utensils, from the beast:<br>\
[app. because he who does so lifts them off the<br>\
beast:] (K, TA:) أَعْلَاهُ in this sense is disapproved. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See also 1, former half. ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
And see Q. Q. 1.<br>\
3<br>\
مُعَالَاةٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The vying, competing, or contending for superiority, in highness, loftiness, elevation, or eminence. (KL.) You say, عَالَاهُ, meaning سَامَاهُ. (M in art. سمو. [See 3 in that art. in<br>\
two places.]) ―<br>\

having fatness, means It was wrought (صُنِعَ [app.<br>\
over a fire]) until it rose in the operation. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  عَالَوْا نَعِيَّهُ (assumed tropical:)  They manifested the announcement<br>\
of his death: (K, TA:) [as though meaning they<br>\
raised the report of his death:] one should not<br>\
say أَعْلَوْهُ nor عَلَّوْهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See 2, in three<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b6-  عَالَتِ البَيْقُورَ, occurring in a verse of<br>\
Umeiyeh Ibn-Abi-s-Salt, is mentioned and explained in the S in this art. and in art. عول: see<br>\
the latter art. [to which it seems more properly to<br>\
belong]. ―<br>\
-b7-  See 1, former half, in two places. ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
عَالِ عَنِّى Remove thou, or go thou away or aside,<br>\
from me; as also عَنِّى ↓ أَعْلِ; (S, TA;) for<br>\
which latter, أَعْلِ عَنِّجْ occurs in a trad. respecting the slaughter of Abu-Jahl; and عَنِّى ↓ اُعْلُ<br>\
with the conjunctive ا is a dial. var. of أَعْلِ عَنِّى<br>\
with the disjunctive ا mentioned by Fr. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b9-  [Hence,] one says, عَنَّا ↓ أَعْلِ and عَالِ [i. e. and<br>\
عَالِ عَنَّا], meaning (assumed tropical:)  Seek the object of thy want<br>\
at the hands of other than us (عِنْدَ غَيْرِنَا), for we<br>\
are not able to accomplish it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  And عالى<br>\
and ↓ اعلى signify He came to the &#39;Áliyeh of Nejd,<br>\
i. e. the region above Nejd, extending to the land<br>\
of Tihámeh and the part behind Mekkeh, (S, K,)<br>\
i. e. [to] El-Hijáz and what is next to it. (S.)<br>\
4<br>\
اعلاهُ He (a man, Msb) elevated it (i. e. a<br>\
thing, Msb); or made it high, or lofty; (Msb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ علّاهُ, (K,) with teshdeed, (TA,)<br>\
and بِهِ ↓ عَلَا [without teshdeed]: (K:) it is [also]<br>\
said of God, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He elevated, or exalted,<br>\
him; and ↓ عالاهُ is like it [in meaning]: (S:)<br>\
and بِفُلَانٍ ↓ عَالَيْتُ signifies the same as أَعْلَيْتُهُ<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  I elevated, or exalted, such a one; as also, app.,<br>\
(see 4 in art. ظهر,) أَعْلَيْتُ بِفُلَانٍ]. (Ham p. 175.)<br>\
Hence one says, أَعْلَى اللّٰهُ كَعْبَهُ [(tropical:)  God exalted,<br>\
or may God exalt, his nobility]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also 1, former half. ―<br>\
-b3-  أَعْلِ الوِسَادَةَ means Sit<br>\
thou upon the cushion. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And أَعْلِ عَنِ<br>\
الوِسَادَةِ Rise thou from the cushion; syn. قُمْ: (TA<br>\
in art. دك:) or descend thou from it. (S * and<br>\
TA in the present art.) And اعلى عَنِ الدَّابَّةِ He<br>\
alighted from the beast. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also 3,<br>\
latter half, in three places.<br>\
5<br>\
تعلّى: see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (K)<br>\
He, or it, was, or became, high, elevated, or lofty,<br>\
gently, or leisurely. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He came<br>\
upon a party of men suddenly, or at unawares,<br>\
without permission. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  تَعَلَّتْ مِنْ نِفَاسِهَا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  She (a woman) became free, (S, Mgh, K,) and<br>\
passed forth, (Mgh,) from her state of impurity<br>\
consequent upon childbirth; (S, Mgh, K;) as also<br>\
↓ تَعَالَتْ; (Mgh; and TA in art. عل;) and so<br>\
تَعَالَّتْ, as well as تَعَلَّلَتْ: (K and TA in that art.:)<br>\
or مِنْ مَرَضِهَا from her disease: (K:) or you say<br>\
of a woman, تعلّت من نفاسها meaning [as above<br>\
or] she became pure from the effects of her childbirth: (TA:) and of a man you say, تعلّى مِنْ<br>\
عِلَّتِهِ (S, TA) he recovered from his disease. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تعالى: see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Addressing<br>\
a man, (S, Msb,) using the imperative form, you<br>\
say, تَعَالَ, (S, Msb, K,) with fet-h to the ل, (S,<br>\
K,) originally meaning Be thou elevated, (S,<br>\
Msb,) and said by a man in a high place in calling<br>\
a man in a low place; (Msb;) then, by reason<br>\
of frequency of usage, employed in the sense of<br>\
هَلُمَّ [meaning Come thou], (S, Msb,) absolutely,<br>\
whether the place of the person called be high or<br>\
low or on the same level; so that it is originally<br>\
applied to denote a particular meaning, and then<br>\
used in a general meaning: (Msb:) and to a<br>\
woman one says, تَعَالَىْ; (S, K;) and to two<br>\
women, (S,) or two persons, (TA,) تَعَالَيَا; (S,<br>\
TA;) and to a pl. number of men, تَعَالَوْا; (Msb,<br>\
TA;) and to a pl. number of women, تَعَالَيْنَ;<br>\
(S, Msb, TA;) and sometimes the ل is pronounced with damm in the pl. masc., and with<br>\
kesr in the fem.; whence El-Hasan El-Basree<br>\
read, [in the Kur iii. 57,] قُلْ يَا أَهْلَ الْكِتَابِ تَعَالُوا<br>\
[Say thou, O people of the Scripture, come ye,<br>\
the usual reading being تَعَالَوْا], for the sake of<br>\
congeniality with the و: (Msb, TA:) it is not<br>\
allowable to say تَعَالَيْتُ [as meaning I came],<br>\
nor to use the prohibitive form; (S;) but one<br>\
says, (thus accord. to several copies of the S,)<br>\
or nor does one say, (thus accord. to one of<br>\
my copies of the S, [and accord. to the TA, in<br>\
which it is said that the verb is not used otherwise than in the imperative form,]) قَدْ تَعَالَيْتُ<br>\
[as meaning I have come], and إِلَى أَىِّ شَىْءٍ أَتَعَالَى<br>\
[as meaning To what thing shall I come? like as<br>\
one says, إِلَامَ أَهَلُمَّ]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [تعالى signifies also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, exalted, or extolled: and<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  he exalted himself: and in both of these senses<br>\
it is often followed by عَنْ as syn. with عَلَى, denoting superiority: you say, تعالى فُلَانٌ عَنْ كَذَا,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one was, or became, exalted<br>\
above such a thing; or simply, was, or became,<br>\
above it, i. e. too elevated in character for it: and<br>\
also, exalted himself above such a thing; or held<br>\
himself above it.] Said of God, in the Kur<br>\
xx. 113 [and in other instances therein], it means<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  Exalted, or supremely exalted, is He] in his<br>\
essence and his attributes, above the created<br>\
beings. (Bd.) [But in common speech, it is<br>\
generally used as an ejaculation of praise, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Exalted or extolled, or supremely exalted or<br>\
extolled, be He, or his greatness or majesty or<br>\
glory, or his name; or acknowledged be his absolute supremacy. And the common expression<br>\
(used in citing words of the Kur-án) قَالَ تَعَالَى<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  He saith, or hath said, exalted or extolled, or supremely exalted or extolled, be He;<br>\

إِسْتَعْلَوَ see 1, in seven places. [The inf. n. اِسْتِعْلَآءٌ,<br>\
properly denotes Superiority that is perceptible by<br>\

-b2-  One<br>\
says also, هٰذِهِ الكَلِمَةُ تَسْتَعْلِى لِسَانِى, meaning<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  This word, or sentence,] is often current upon<br>\
my tongue. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اِسْتَعْلَى عَلَى الغَايَةِ,<br>\
said of a horse in the contending to outstrip in a<br>\

or title, to the book, or writing; or he wrote the<br>\
superscription, or title, thereof]; (S, K;) as also<br>\
الكِتَابَ ↓ عَلَّى; (K;) which latter is the more<br>\
agreeable with analogy. (TA.) [See also Q. Q. 1<br>\
in arts. عن and عنو.]<br>\
مِنْ عَلُ: see the next paragraph. It also signifies, simply, Above him or it; or in the higher,<br>\
or highest, part of him or it: thus in a hemistich<br>\
cited voce تَحْت. (Mughnee.) [In all cases,] عَلُ<br>\
is determinate, and indecl., with damm for its<br>\
invariable termination: (Mughnee, TA:) [for it<br>\
is regarded as a prefixed noun of which the complement is to be understood as to the meaning<br>\
but not as to the letter:] in the saying of Ows,<br>\
كَغِرْقِئِ بَيْضٍ كَنَّهُ القَيْضُ مِنْ عَلُو<br>\
[Like the thin pellicle of eggs, which the shell covers<br>\
above], the و [in عَلُو] is augmentative, being<br>\
added to render the rhyme unrestricted: (S,<br>\
TA:) and in the instance of مِنْ عَلُهْ, likewise<br>\
ending a verse, the ه is that of pausation: for if<br>\
عَلُ were [really] a prefixed noun, it would not be<br>\
thus indecl. (Mughnee, TA.)<br>\
أَتَيْتُهُ مِنْ عَلِ, (S, * K,) whence the saying of<br>\
Imra-el-Keys cited in the first paragraph of art.<br>\
حط, (S, Mughnee, TA,) and ↓ مِنْ عَلُ, [respecting which see the next preceding paragraph,]<br>\
and ↓ مِنْ عَلَا, (S, K,) of which a verse cited<br>\
voce نَاشَ in art. نوش is an ex., (S, TA,) and<br>\
↓ مِنع عَالٍ, signify the same, (S, Mughnee, K,)<br>\
i. e. مِنْ فَوْقٍ; (K;) [which, with أَتَيْتُهُ preceding<br>\
it, means I came to him, or it, from above; and<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I overcame, or subdued, him, or it; for] اتاه من<br>\
فوق and من علو [app. ↓ من عَلْوٍ (see عَلْوٌ below,)<br>\
tropically used,] means قَهَرَهُ; (Ham p. 128;) [but<br>\
the former is here meant in many, if not in all,<br>\
instances, as is shown by what follows;] and [in<br>\
like manner] one says, ↓ أَتَيْتُهُ مِنْ مُعَالٍ; [whence]<br>\
Dhu-r-Rummeh says,<br>\
وَنَغَضَانُ الرّحْلِ مِنْ مُعَالِ<br>\
[And the shaking of the camel&#39;s saddle in the<br>\
upper part]. (S, TA.) عَلِ in مِنْ عَلِ is indeterminate [in itself] and decl. [as being a prefixed<br>\
noun of which the complement is to be understood<br>\
as to the meaning and as to the letter; thus differing from عَلُ in مِنْ عَلُ: if the complement<br>\
were not to be understood either as to the letter<br>\
or as to the meaning, one would say مِنْ عَلٍ,<br>\
originally مِنْ عَلْوٍ]. (TA.) One says also أَتَيْتُهُ<br>\
مِنْ عَلِ الدَّارِ, [thus in several copies of the S,<br>\
from which one of my copies deviates by erroneously substituting عَلى for عَلِ,] with kesr to<br>\
the ل, meaning مِنْ عَالِ [or rather مِنْ عَالِ الدَّارِ<br>\
i. e. I came to him, or it, from the high, or<br>\
elevated, part of the house or abode]: (S:) or the<br>\
using عَل [thus] as a prefixed noun is a mistake.<br>\
(Mughnee.) ―<br>\

and ↓ عَلَا عَلَا [Chide thou the young one of the<br>\
wild cow, saying عَلِ عَلِ and عَلَا عَلَا]. (TA.)<br>\
عَلَا [as a subst.]: see the next preceding paragraph, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  See also عَلَاةٌ.<br>\
عَلْوٌ: see عُلْوٌ in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A high, or<br>\
an elevated, state of the base, or foundation, of a<br>\
building. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And you say, أَخَذَهُ عَلْوًا,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He took him, or it, by force. (K,<br>\
TA.) See also the next but one of the preceding<br>\
paragraphs.<br>\
عُلْوٌ and ↓ عِلْوٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ عَلْوٌ (K) signify The higher, or highest, part (S, Msb, K) of<br>\
a house, or an abode, (S, Msb,) or of a thing;<br>\
(K;) as also ↓ عِلْوَةٌ (K voce سُفْلٌ) and ↓ عُلَاوَةٌ<br>\
and ↓ عَالِيَةٌ. (K in the present art.) You say, قَعَدْتُ<br>\
عُلْوَهُ and ↓ عِلْوَهُ and فِى عُلْوِهِ and ↓ فى عِلْوِهِ [i. e.<br>\
I sat in the higher, or highest, part of it]. (TA.)<br>\
And Aashà-Báhileh says,<br>\
إِنِّى أَتَنْنِى لِسَانٌ لَا أُسَرُّ بِهَا<br>\
لَا عَجَبٌ مِنْهَا وَلَا سُخُرُ ↓مِنْ عَلْوَ<br>\
(S,) or, as in one of my copies of the S, أَسُرُّ and<br>\
سَخَرُ,) i. e. Verily information has come to me<br>\
[by which I shall not be rejoiced (or by which I<br>\
shall not rejoice others, accord. to the latter reading mentioned above,)] from the higher, or highest,<br>\
parts of Nejd, (مِنْ أَعْلَى نَجْدٍ, thus in some<br>\
copies of the S and in the TA, but in other copies<br>\
of the S the word نَجْدٍ is omitted,) [at which<br>\
there is no wondering, as at a thing that is improbable, nor any scoffing;] related [thus] with<br>\
fet-h to the و and with damm thereto and with<br>\
kesr thereto [i. e. عَلْوَ as above and also ↓ عَلْوُ and<br>\
↓ عَلْوِ]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, هٰذَا شِعْرُ عُلْو<br>\
[app. عُلْوٍ], meaning (assumed tropical:)  This is poetry of a high<br>\
class: or [the last word may be ↓ عَلْوَ or عَلْوُ or<br>\
عَلْوِ, for it may mean], of the higher, or highest,<br>\
part of Nejd. (TA.)<br>\
عِلْوٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
عَلْىٌ: see عَلْيَآءُ.<br>\
عِلْىٌ: see عَلِىٌّ.<br>\
عَلَى is a particle and a noun (Mbr, S, Mughnee, K) and a verb; (Mbr, S;) though some<br>\
assert that it is only a noun, and ascribe this assertion to Sb: (Mughnee:) its alif, (Sb, S, Msb,)<br>\
[which, when it has no affix, is written ى, and]<br>\
which is originally و, (Sb, S,) [like that of إِلَى,<br>\
q. v.,] is changed into [what is properly] ى when<br>\
it has a pronominal affix, (Sb, S, Msb,) as in<br>\
عَلَيْكَ, (Sb, S,) and عَلَيْهِ; (Msb;) but some of<br>\
the Arabs [in this case] leave it unchanged, as in<br>\
the saying of a rájiz,<br>\
طَارُوا عَلَاهُنَّ فَطِرْ عَلَاهَا<br>\
[They fled, or have fled, upon them, (referring to<br>\
camels,) and flee thou upon her]; this, it is said,<br>\
being of the dial. of Belhárith Ibn-Kaab. (Sb,<br>\
S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  As a particle, it has nine [or more than<br>\
nine] meanings. (Mughnee.) As such, (Mughnee,) or, accord. to Sb, as a noun, (K,) it denotes<br>\
الاِسْتِعْلَآء [i. e. superiority] (Msb, Es-Subkee,<br>\
Mughnee, K, TA) properly thus termed, (Msb,)<br>\
such as is perceptible by sense; (Es-Subkee,<br>\
TA;) either with respect to what is signified by<br>\
the noun governed by it, and this is generally<br>\
the case, (Mughnee,) as in the saying [in the Kur<br>\
xxiii. 22 and xl. 80], وَعَلَيْهَا وَعَلَى الْفُلْكِ تُحْمَلُونَ<br>\
[And upon them (referring to camels) and upon<br>\
the ship, or ships, ye are carried]; (Mughnee,<br>\
K;) or with respect to what is near thereto, as<br>\
in the saying [in the Kur xx. 10], أَوْ أَجِدُ<br>\
عَلَى النَّارِ هُدًى [Or I shall find near upon the<br>\
fire, i. e. at the fire, a right direction]: (Mughnee:) and using it to denote الاستعلآء properly<br>\
thus termed, you say, كُنْتُ عَلَى السَّطْحِ [I was<br>\
upon the flat house-top]: (Msb:) [in like manner<br>\
also,] as denoting الاستعلآء that is perceptible by<br>\
sense, it occurs in the saying [in the Kur lv. 26],<br>\
كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ [Every one that is upon it (referring to the earth) is transitory]: (Es-Subkee,<br>\
TA:) and you say, عَلَى زَيْدٍ ثَوْبٌ [Upon Zeyd<br>\
is, or was, a garment], عَلَى being here a particle;<br>\
and عَلَا زَيْدًا ثَوْبٌ [A garment was upon Zeyd,]<br>\
عَلَا being here a verb. (Mbr, S.) And it denotes<br>\
الاستعلآء, likewise, tropically thus termed, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) such as is ideal, or perceived by the intel-lect; (Msb, Es-Subkee, Mughnee, TA;) as in<br>\
the saying زَيْدٌ عَلَيْهِ دَيْنٌ (tropical:)  [Zeyd, a debt is lying<br>\
upon him, or incumbent on him, i. e. he owes a<br>\
debt, لِفُلَانٍ to such a one], that which is ideal<br>\
being thus likened to that which is corporeal;<br>\
(Msb;) and in the phrases عَلَيْنَا أَمْرٌ and عَلَيْنَا مَالٌ,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  An affair, or a command, lies, or rests,<br>\
upon us, or is incumbent on us, and so property,<br>\
[as due from us, i. e.] the former as a duty and<br>\
the latter as a debt, i. e. يَثْبُتُ, like as the thing<br>\
lies, or rests, (يَثْبُتُ,) upon the place; the latter<br>\
phrase importing responsibility: and ثَبَتَ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
مَالٌ is also said to mean كَثُرَ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  property was,<br>\
or became, much in quantity, or amount, upon<br>\
him, app. as a burden imposing upon him responsibility]. (TA.) And it [likewise] denotes ideal<br>\
استعلآء in the phrase لَهُمْ عَلَىَّ ذَنْبٌ (tropical:)  [A crime,<br>\
or an offence, committed upon (or here, as in<br>\
many other instances, it may be rendered against)<br>\
me is imputable to them]: (Mughnee:) and so in<br>\
the saying [in the Kur ii. 254 and xvii. 22],<br>\
فَضَّلْنَا بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ (tropical:)  [We have made some of<br>\
them to have superiority over some]. (Es-Subkee,<br>\
Mughnee, TA.) [See also أَنْتَ عَلَى عَيْنِى, and<br>\
and أَنْتَ عَلَى رَأْسِى, voce عَيْنٌ, first quarter.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
It also denotes concomitance, like مَعَ; as in the<br>\
saying [in the Kur ii. 172], وَآتَى المَالَ عَلَى حُبِّهِ<br>\
[And giveth property with (or notwithstanding)<br>\
the love of it]; (Mughnee, K;) and so it is said<br>\
to be used in the phrase, in a trad. respecting<br>\
the alms of the breaking of the fast [of Ramadán],<br>\
عَلَى كُلِّ حُرٍّ وَعَبْدٍ صَاعٌ [With every free man and<br>\
slave, a sáa], because the alms-gift of the breaking of the fast is not incumbent on the slave, but<br>\
only on his master; (IAth, TA;) and so it is<br>\
used in the [common] phrase, عَلَى أَنَّنِى رَاضٍ<br>\
[With (or notwithstanding) my being pleased, or<br>\
well pleased, or content]. (Har p. 13.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It also<br>\
denotes transition, (Mughnee, K,) like عَنْ;<br>\
(Mughnee;) as in the saying (of El-Koheyf El-<br>\
&#39;Okeylee, TA),<br>\
إِذَا رَضِيَتْ عَلَىَّ بَنُو قُشَيْرٍ<br>\
لَعَمْرُ اللّٰهِ أَعْجَبَنِى رِضَاهَا<br>\
[When the sons of Kusheyr shall be pleased, or<br>\
well pleased, or content, with me, (or rather, if عَلَىَّ<br>\
here denote transition, with what will proceed<br>\
from me,) by the everlasting existence of God,<br>\
their being pleased, &amp;c., will induce in me admiration, or pleasure], (Mughnee, K, * TA,) i. e. عَنِّى;<br>\
(Mughnee, TA;) or it may be that رَضِىَ is made<br>\
to imply the meaning of عَطَفَ [which is trans.<br>\
by means of عَلَى]; (Mughnee;) or, as Ks says,<br>\
it is made to accord with its contr. سَخِطَ, (Mughnee, TA,) by its being made trans. by means of<br>\
عَلَى: (TA:) and so in the saying,<br>\
فِى لَيْلَةٍ لَا نَرَى بِهَا أَحَدًا<br>\
يَحْكِى عَلَيْنَا إِلَّا كَوَاكِبَهَا<br>\
[In a nigh in which we shall not see any one that<br>\
shall report what will proceed from us, except its<br>\
stars], i. e., عَنَّا; or it may be said that يَحْكِى is<br>\
[here] made to imply the meaning of يَنُِمُّ. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b5-  It is also used to assign a cause, like ل;<br>\
as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 181], وَلِتُكَبِّرُوا اللّٰهَ<br>\
عَلَى مَا هَدَاكُمْ, (Mughnee, K,) meaning لِهِدَايَتِهِ<br>\
إِيَّاكُمْ [i. e. And that ye should magnify God<br>\
for, or on account of, his rightly directing you];<br>\
(Mughnee;) [and in the same, vi. 90, &amp;c., لَا<br>\
أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا i. e. I will not ask of you for it,<br>\
or on account of it, a recompense;] and as in the<br>\
saying of Rabee&#39;ah Ibn Makroom Ed-Dabbee,<br>\
فَدَعَوْا نَزَالِ فَكُنْتُ أَوَّلَ نَازِلٍ<br>\
وَعَلَامَ أَرْكَبُهُ إِذَا لَمْ أَنْزِلِ<br>\
i. e. [And they called out, “Alight; ” and I was<br>\
the first of any alighting:] and for what [or<br>\
wherefore] do I ride him if I do not alight when<br>\
called upon to do so? (Ham p. 29. [عَلَامَ is<br>\
here, as usually, for عَلَى مَ.]) ―<br>\
-b6-  It is also used<br>\
in the sense of فِى [generally followed by a noun<br>\
significant of time]; (S, Mughnee, K; *) as in the<br>\
saying [in the Kur xxviii. 14], وَدَخَلَ الْمَدِينَةَ<br>\
عَلَى حِينِ غَفْلَةٍ [And he entered the city in, or<br>\
during, a time of inadvertence]; (Mughnee, K;)<br>\
and in the saying [in the same ii. 96], وَاتَّبَعُوا مَا<br>\
تَتْلُو الشَّيَاطِينُ عَلَى مُلْكِ سُلَيْمَانَ, meaning, فِى<br>\
زَمَنِ مُلكِ سليمان [i. e. And they followed what<br>\
the devils related, or recited, in the time of, or<br>\
during, the reign of Suleymán (or Solomon)];<br>\
(Mughnee;) and in the phrase, كَانَ كَذَا عَلَى<br>\
عَهْدِ فُلَانٍ, meaning, فِى عَهْدِهِ [i. e. It was thus,<br>\
or such a thing was, in the time of such a one]:<br>\
(S:) [and in like manner it is used in the saying<br>\
in the Kur iii. 173, مَا كَانَ اللّٰهُ لِيَذَرَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ<br>\
عَلَى مَا أَنْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ God is not purposing to leave,<br>\
or certainly will not leave, the believers in that<br>\
state wherein ye are: and in the phrase عَلَى سَفَرٍ,<br>\
in ii. 180 &amp;c. of the same, i. e. In (or, as we also<br>\
say, on) a journey: in like manner also] لَقَدْ<br>\
سَرَيْتُ عَلَى الظَّلَامِ, in a verse of Aboo-Kebeer<br>\
El-Hudhalee, means, فِى الظَّلَامِ [i. e. I have<br>\
journeyed by night in the darkness], فى الظلام<br>\
holding the place of a noun in the accus. case as<br>\
a ظَرْف [i. e. an adverbial noun of time or place];<br>\
or it may be in the place of a denotative of state,<br>\
meaning وَأَنَا عَلَى الظَّلَامِ i. e. رَاكِبٌ لَهُ [riding<br>\
upon the darkness]: (Ham p. 37:) and you say<br>\
of one who was desiring to rise and hasten, رَأَيْتُهُ<br>\
عَلَى أَوْفَاضٍ [i. e. I found him in a state of haste:<br>\
see وَفْضٌ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [It also denotes conformity,<br>\
accordance, adaptation, or agreement; as in the<br>\
phrase, اِضْرِبْهُ عَلَى طَبْعِ هٰذَا i. e. Make thou it,<br>\
fashion it, or mould it, conformably, or according, to the model, make, fashion, or mould, of this;<br>\
(see طَبْعٌ;) and in طُبِعَ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ and جُبِلَ and<br>\
فُطِرَ &amp;c. i. e. He (a man) was created conformably, or with an adaptation or a disposition, to<br>\
the thing: (see 1 in art. طبع:) so too in the<br>\
phrase in the Kur xxiv. last verse, قَدْ يَعْلَمُ مَا أَنْتُمْ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ Certainly He knoweth that state of conduct<br>\
and mind to which ye are conforming yourselves;<br>\
and in many other passages therein: thus also in<br>\
the saying of Mohammad, كُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى<br>\
الفِطْرةِ Every infant is born in a state of conformity to the natural constitution with which he<br>\
is created in his mother&#39;s womb in relation to the<br>\
soul; (see art. فطر;) and in the prov., mentioned<br>\
by Meyd, النَّاسُ عَلَى دِينِ المُلُوكِ The people are<br>\
in conformity to, i. e. are followers of, or follow,<br>\
the religion of the kings; and in the phrase, relating to a saying or an opinion, عَلَيْهِ أَكْثَرُ العُلَمَآءِ<br>\
Upon it most of the learned are in agreement; in<br>\
which, as in other exs. of the same kind, a verb<br>\
or a part. n., (in the last, for instance, مُجْمِعُونَ<br>\
or the like,) is understood. ―<br>\
-b8-  It also denotes a<br>\
condition; as in the phrases, صَالَحَهُ عَلَى كَذَا<br>\
He made peace, or reconciliation, or a compromise, with him on the condition of such a thing,<br>\
and عَلَى أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا on the condition of his doing<br>\
such a thing. ―<br>\
-b9-  And there are various other usages<br>\
of this prep. depending upon verbs or part. ns.<br>\
expressed or obviously understood in connection<br>\
with them, too numerous to be here collected.<br>\
Many of these will be found among the explanations of words with which they occur.] ―<br>\
-b10-  It is<br>\
also used in the sense of مِنْ; as in the saying,<br>\
إِذَا اكْتَالُوا عَلَى النَّاسِ يَسْتَوْفُونَ, (S, Mughnee, K,)<br>\
in the Kur [lxxxiii. 2], meaning, مِنَ النَّاسِ [i. e.<br>\
Who, when they take by measure from men, take<br>\
fully], (S,) or, as in the T, عَنِ النَّاسِ [which signifies the same]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  It is also used in the<br>\
sense of بِ; (S, Mughnee, K;) as in the saying<br>\
in the Kur [vii. 103], عَلَى أنْ لَا أَقُولَ عَلَى اللّٰهِ إِلَّا<br>\
الْحَقَّ, (Mughnee, K, *) meaning بِأَنْ, (TA,) [i. e.<br>\
That I should not say of God aught save the<br>\
truth,] and Ubeí read with ب [i. e. بِأَنْ]; (Bd,<br>\
Mughnee;) like as they say, رَمَيْتُ عَلَى القَوْسِ<br>\
[meaning بِالقَوْسِ, i. e. I shot with the bow], and<br>\
جِئْتُ عَلَى حَالٍ حَسَنَةٍ [meaning بِحَالٍ حَسَنَةٍ, i. e.<br>\
I came in a good condition]; (Bd; [in which,<br>\
and also voce حَقِيقٌ, last sentence, see more;])<br>\
and they said also, اِرْكَبْ عَلَى اسْمِ اللّٰهِ [meaning,<br>\
بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ, i. e. Mount thou in the name of God]:<br>\
(Mughnee:) thus [too] it is used in the saying of<br>\
Aboo-Dhu-eyb,<br>\
يَسَرٌ يُفِيضُ عَلَى القِدَاحِ وَيَصْدَعُ<br>\
[expl. in art. فيض, conj. 4,] meaning بِالقِدَاحِ:<br>\
(S:) [and in the phrase عَلَى يَدِهِ i. e. By his<br>\
hand, or (assumed tropical:)  by his means.] ―<br>\
-b12-  It is also used to<br>\
denote an emendation, (Mughnee, K,) and a<br>\
digression, or transition, (Mughnee,) like لٰكِنَّ;<br>\
(TA;) as in the saying, فُلَانٌ لَا يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ لِسُوءِ<br>\
صَنِيعِهِ, (Mughnee,) or فُلَانٌ جَهَنَّمِىٌّ, (K,) عَلَى أَنَّهُ<br>\
لَا يّيْأَسُ مِنْ رَحْمةِ اللّٰهِ, (Mughnee, K,) meaning<br>\
لٰكِنَّهُ [i. e. Such a one will not enter Paradise,<br>\
because of the evilness of his deed, or conduct, or<br>\
such a one is hell-doomed; but, or yet, he will not<br>\
despair of the mercy of God]: (TA:) and thus<br>\
it is used in the saying,<br>\
بِكُلٍّ تَدَاوَيْنَا فَلَمْ يُشْفَ مَا بِنَا<br>\
عَلَى أَنَّ قُرْبَ الدَّارِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ البُعْدِ<br>\
عَلَى أَنَّ قُرْبَ الدَّارِ لَيْسَ بِنَافِعٍ<br>\
إِذَا كَانَ مَنْ تَهْوَاهُ لِيْسَ بِذِى وَدِّ<br>\
[With everything we treated, or have treated, ourselves curatively, and what was in us was not, or<br>\
has not been, healed; but the nearness of the abode<br>\
is better than the remoteness; but the nearness of<br>\
the abode is not profitable when the person whom<br>\
thou lovest is not endued with affection]: the poet<br>\
invalidates by the first عَلَى his saying فَلَمْ يُشْفَ<br>\
مَا بِنَا; and then, by the second عَلَى, the clause<br>\
immediately preceding it. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b13-  It is<br>\
also redundant, for the purpose of compensation;<br>\
as in the saying,<br>\
إِنَّ الكَرِيمَ وَأَبِيكَ يَعْتَمِلْ<br>\
إِنْ لَمْ يَجِدْ يَوْمًا عَلَى مَنْ يَتَّكِلْ<br>\
meaning مَنْ يَتَّكِلُ عَلَيْهِ [i. e. Verily the generous,<br>\
by thy father, will work for himself when he finds<br>\
not, some day, him upon whom he may rely];<br>\
عَلَى being added before مَنْ for the purpose of<br>\
compensation [for its omission in its proper place]:<br>\
(Mughnee, K:) Es-Subkee says, it may be redundant, as in the saying, لَا أَحْلِفُ عَلَى يَمِينٍ, meaning لا احلف يَمِينًا [i. e. I will not swear an oath].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also a noun, having the meaning<br>\
of فَوْق [i. e. The location that is above, or over],<br>\
this being the case when it is immediately followed<br>\
by مِنْ; (S, Msb, Mughnee, K; *) as in the saying (of Muzáhim-El-&#39;Okeylee, describing a قَطَاة<br>\
[or sand-grouse, and, afterwards, its making a<br>\
rumbling sound in its inside, from thirst], TA),<br>\
غَدَتْ مِنْ عَلَيْهِ بِعْدَ مَا تَمَّ ظِمْؤُهَا<br>\
[It went away in the early morning from the<br>\
location above it, (or, as we say, from above it,)<br>\
after that her interval between two comings to<br>\
water was complete]: (Msb, Mughnee, K: [and<br>\
a similar ex. is cited in the S:]) or, accord. to<br>\
As, meaning مِنْ عِنْدِهِ [from its vicinage]: and,<br>\
used in this sense, as a noun, it admits before it<br>\
no other prep. than مِنْ. (Msb.)<br>\
-A3-  عَلَيْكَ is also<br>\
a verbal noun, used as an incentive: (TA:) you<br>\
say, عَلَيْكَ زَيْدًا, (S, K, TA,) and بِزَيْدٍ, (TA,)<br>\
meaning Take thou Zeyd; or take thou hold of<br>\
Zeyd: (S, TA:) or keep thou, or cleave thou, to<br>\
Zeyd: (K, TA:) and عَلَيْكَ بِكَذَا keep thou to<br>\
such a thing: (El-Munáwee, TA in art. ب:)<br>\
[thus] it is said in a trad., عَلَيْكَ باِلرِّفْقِ [Keep<br>\
thou to gentleness]. (El-Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And [in like manner] you say, عَلَىَّ زَيْدًا, and<br>\
بِزَيْدٍ, meaning Give thou me, or present thou to<br>\
me, Zeyd: (S, TA:) [or, more commonly, bring<br>\
thou to me Zeyd:] you say, عَلَىَّ بِكَذَا, meaning<br>\
bring thou to me such a thing. (MA.)<br>\
عُلًى: see عَلَآءٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is also pl. of عُلْيَا, fem.<br>\
of أَعْلَى, q. v.]<br>\
عَلَاةٌ The سِنْدَان [or anvil], (S, Mgh, K, TA,)<br>\
whether of شجر [app. meaning of such as are<br>\
made from trees, or perhaps this is a mistranscription for صَخْر, i. e. rock], or of iron; or the<br>\
زُبْرَة [i. e. iron anvil] upon which the blacksmith<br>\
beats iron: (TA:) pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]<br>\
↓ عَلًا. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence it is applied to a she-camel,<br>\
as being likened thereto in respect of her hardness:<br>\
you say نَاقَةٌ عَلَاةُ الخَلْقِ (assumed tropical:)  [A she-camel hard, or<br>\
firm, in respect of make]: (S:) or عَلَاةٌ thus<br>\
applied signifies tall, or overtopping; as also<br>\
↓ عِلْيَانٌ, and ↓ عِلِّيَانٌ: (K, TA:) or ↓ عِلْيَانٌ,<br>\
(TA,) or ↓ عَلْيَانٌ, (S,) and ↓ عِلِّيَانٌ, (TA,) signify, thus applied, tall and bulky; (S, TA;) or,<br>\
as some say, outstripping in pace or journeying;<br>\
never seen otherwise than before the other camels.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A stone [placed upon two other<br>\
stones called حِمَارَانِ (q. v.)] upon which is put [to<br>\
dry the preparation of curd called] أَقِط: (S, K,<br>\
TA:) or, as some say, a piece of rock upon<br>\
which is made a circle of أَخْثَآء [or lumps of dung<br>\
such as is called خِثْى (q. v.)] and bricks, or crude<br>\
bricks, (لَبِن,) and ashes, and in, or upon, which<br>\
أَقَط is then cooked: pl. [or coll. gen. n.] as above.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And A thing like the [milking-vessel<br>\
called] عُلْبَة, around which [dung such as is called]<br>\
خِثْى is put, and which is used for milking<br>\
therein. (K.)<br>\
