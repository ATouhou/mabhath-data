accord. to AZ. (TA.)<br>\

-A2-  and see also 10.<br>\
-A3-  تَعْوِينٌ signifies also The he-ass&#39;s leaping his she-ass much,<br>\
or often. (IAar, K.)<br>\

عَاوَنَهُ, inf. n. مُعَاوَنَةٌ and عِوَانٌ (K,) [He<br>\
aided, helped, or assisted, him, being aided, &amp;c.,<br>\
by him:] see 6: ―<br>\
-b2-  and i. q. أَعَانَهُ: see the latter,<br>\
and see also 10.<br>\
4<br>\
اعانهُ [inf. n. إِعَانَةٌ] and ↓ عَاوَنَهُ signify the<br>\
same, (S, * MA, K,) i. e. He aided, helped, or<br>\
assisted, him. (MA.) رَبِّ أَعِنِّى وَلَا تُعِنْ عَلَىَّ<br>\
[O my Lord, aid me, and aid not against me,] is<br>\
said in a form of prayer. (S.) [And you say,<br>\
اعانهُ عَلَي الأَمْرِ lit. He aided him against, meaning, to accomplish, or perform, the affair]. See<br>\
also 6 and 10, the latter in two places.<br>\
5<br>\
تَعَيَّنَ, originally تَعَوَّنَ: see 10, last sentence.<br>\
6<br>\
تَعَاوَنُوا signifies بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا ↓ أَعَانَ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) They aided, helped, or assisted, one<br>\
another; (MA;) as also ↓ عَاوَنُوا; (Msb;) and<br>\
↓ اِعْتَوَنُوا, (S, K,) in which the و is preserved<br>\
because it is preserved in تعاونوا with which it is<br>\
syn.; (Sb, S;) and also ↓ اِعْتَانُوا, accord. to IB,<br>\
who cites as an ex. a verse in which نَعْتَانُ occurs;<br>\
but this correctly means نَأْخُذُ العِينَةَ [belonging<br>\
to art. عين]. (TA.) One says, تَعاونوا عَلَي الأَمْرِ<br>\
They aided, helped, or assisted, one another [lit.<br>\

which last, ↓ عَوَّنَنِى is erroneously put in the<br>\
copies of the K; (TA;) [i. e. I sought, &amp;c., of<br>\
him, aid, &amp;c., and he aided me.] The alteration<br>\
of the infirm letter [و into ا] is made in استعان<br>\
and ↓ اعان in imitation of a general rule [which<br>\
requires it when that alteration is made in the<br>\
unaugmented triliteral verb], though عَانَ, aor.<br>\
يَعُونُ, [as their source of derivation,] is not used.<br>\
(TA.) ب [i. e. بِ] is called حَرْفُ اسْتِعَانَةٍ [A<br>\
particle denotative of seeking aid, &amp;c.,] because<br>\
when you say ضَرَبْتُ بِالسَّيْفِ and كَتَبْتُ بِالقَلَمِ<br>\
and بَرَيْتُ بِالمُدْيَةِ, it is as though you said اِسْتَعَنْتُ<br>\
بِهٰذِهِ الأَدَوَاتِ عَلَي هٰذِهِ الأَفْعَالِ [meaning I sought<br>\
aid of these instruments, or made use of them as<br>\
means, against, i. e. to perform, these actions of<br>\

بِنَفْسِهِ, meaning He sought self-help, or exerted<br>\
himself, فِي أَمْرٍ in an affair, and عَلَيْهِ against it,<br>\
or him.]<br>\
-A2-  استعان signifies also He shaved his<br>\
عَانَة, or pubes; (S, Msb, K;) and so ↓ تَعَيَّنَ,<br>\

K) and ↓ مَعْوُنَةٌ, (K, TA,) with damm to the و,<br>\
agreeably, with analogy, (TA, [in the CK<br>\
written مَعْوَنَةٌ,]) and ↓ مَعَانَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
↓ مَعُونٌ, (S, K,) [respecting the second and last<br>\
of which see what follows,] are simply substs.,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K,) and signify Aid, help, or assistance: (S, Mgh, * Msb, * K: *) عَوْنٌ is one of those<br>\
quasi-inf. ns. that govern like the inf. n., i. e. like<br>\
the verb; as in the saying,<br>\
إِذَا صَحَّ عَوْنُ الخَالِقِ الْمَرْءَ لَمْ يَجِدْ<br>\
عَسِيراً مِنَ الآمَالِ إِلَّا مُيَسَّرَا<br>\
[When the Creator&#39;s aiding the man is true, he will<br>\
not find such as is difficult, of hopes, otherwise than<br>\
facilitated]: (I &#39;Ak, § إِعْمَالُ المَصْدَرِ:) or, accord.<br>\
to AHei, it is an inf. n. [having no verb]: (TA:)<br>\
↓ مَعُونَةٌ is of the measure مَقْعُلَةٌ, (Az, Msb, TA,)<br>\
from العَوْنُ; (Az, TA;) or, as some say, of the<br>\
measure فَعُولَةٌ, from المَاعُونُ: (Az, Msb, TA:)<br>\
one says, مَا عِنْدَكَ مَعُونَةٌ and ↓ مَعَانَةٌ and عَوْنٌ<br>\
[i. e. There is not with thee any aid]: (S:) and<br>\
↓ مَا أَخْلَانِى فُلَانٌ مِنْ مَعَاوِنِهِ [Such a one did not<br>\
make me to be destitute of his aids]; مَعَاوِنُ being<br>\
pl. of مَعُونَةٌ: (S, TA:) ↓ مَعُونٌ is said by Ks to<br>\
be syn. with مَعُونَةٌ; (S;) and he says that it is<br>\
the only masc. of the measure مَفْعُلٌ except مَكْرُمٌ:<br>\
(TA:) an ex. of it occurs in a verse of Jemeel<br>\
cited voce أَىُّ: Fr says that it is pl. [virtually,<br>\
though not in the language of the grammarians,]<br>\
of مَعُونَةٌ; (S, TA;) and that there is no sing. of<br>\
the measure مَفْعُلٌ. (S. [On this point, see<br>\

[particularly] a servant: (Har p. 95:) [and an<br>\
armed attendant, a guard, or an officer, of a<br>\
king, and of a prefect of the police, and the like:]<br>\
and ↓ عَوَانِيُّ is an appellation applied to an عَوْن<br>\
[or armed attendant, or a guard,] who accompanies a Sultán, without pay, or allowance: (TA<br>\
in art. تأر:) أَعْوَانٌ is pl. of عَوْنٌ; (Lth, S, Msb,<br>\
K;) and ↓ عَوِينٌ is a quasi-pl. n., (K,) said by<br>\
AA to be syn. with أَعْوَانٌ, and Fr says the like.<br>\
(TA.) The Arabs say, السَّنَةُ جَآءَتْ مَعَهَا<br>\
أَعْوَانُهَا, meaning When drought comes, [its aiders]<br>\
the locusts and the flies and diseases come with it.<br>\
(TA.) And عَوْنٌ signifies Anything that aids,<br>\
helps, or assists, one: for instance, [one says,]<br>\
الصَّوْمُ عَوْنُ العِبَادَةِ [Fasting is the aider of<br>\
religious service]. (Lth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also what<br>\
next follows.<br>\
أَبُو عُونٍ, with damm, Dates: and salt: (K:)<br>\
or ↓ أَبُو عَوْنٍ [thus, with fet-h,] has the latter<br>\
meaning; salt being metonymically thus called<br>\
because its aid is sought for the eating of food.<br>\
(Har p. 227.)<br>\

TA) and AHeyth, (TA,) the place of growth of<br>\
the hair above the anterior pudendum of a man<br>\

itself being called the شِعْرَة (Mgh, Msb, TA) and<br>\
the إِسْب; (Msb, TA;) though it is also called<br>\
عانة (Mgh, Msb) by an extension of the proper<br>\
meaning (Mgh) or by an ellipsis: (Msb:) the<br>\
word is originally عَوَنَةٌ: (Msb:) and the dim. is<br>\
