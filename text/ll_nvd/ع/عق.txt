عَقَّ, (Msb, K, TA,) aor.<br>\
عَقُ3َ, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
عَقٌّ, (Mgh, O, Msb, TA,) He clave, split, slit,<br>\
ripped, or rent; (Mgh, O, Msb, K, TA;) and<br>\
he cut. (Mgh, O, TA.) You say, عَقَّ ثَوْبَهُ He<br>\
slit, ripped, or rent, his garment. (Msb.) And<br>\
عُقَّتْ تَمِيمَتُهُ فِى بَنِى فُلَانٍ [His amulet was cut<br>\
off among the sons of such a one]; said of a boy<br>\
when he has attained to the prime of manhood,<br>\
and become strong, with a tribe; originating<br>\
from the fact that as long as the boy was an infant, his mother hung upon him amulets to preserve him from the evil eye; and when he became<br>\
full-grown, they were cut off from him: whence<br>\
the saying of a poet,<br>\
بِلَادٌ بِهَا عَقَّ الشَّبَابُ تَمِيمَتِى<br>\
وَأَوَّلُ أَرْضٍ مَسَّ جِلْدِى تُرَابُهَا<br>\
[A country in which the attaining to the prime of<br>\
manhood cut off my amulet, and the first land of<br>\
which the dust touched my skin]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[hence,] عَقَّتِ الرِّيحُ المُزْنَ, aor. and inf. n. as<br>\
above, The wind drew forth a shower of fine rain<br>\
from the مزن [or clouds containing water]; as<br>\
though it rent them. (TA.) And عُقَّتِ السَّحَابَةُ<br>\
The cloud poured forth its water; [as though it<br>\
were rent;] and ↓ اِنْعَقَّت [means the same];<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ اعتقّت [likewise]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
عَقَّ عَنْ وَلَدِهِ, (S, Msb,) or عَنِ المَوْلُودِ, (K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَقُ3َ (S, Msb, TA) and<br>\
عَقِ3َ, (TA,) inf. n. عَقٌّ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) He slaughtered as a sacrifice (S, Msb, K,<br>\
TA) for his child, (S, Msb,) or for the new-born<br>\
child, (K,) a sheep or goat, (T, Msb, TA,) [generally the latter,] on the seventh day after the birth.<br>\
(T, S, Msb, TA.) And He shaved the [hair<br>\
termed] عَقِيقَة [q. v.] (S, TA) of his child, (S,)<br>\
or of the new-born child. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَقَّ بِالسَّهْمِ<br>\
He shot the arrow towards the sky; and that<br>\
arrow was called عَقِيقَةٌ; (S, O, K;) and it was<br>\
the arrow of self-excuse: they used to do thus in<br>\
the Time of Ignorance [on the occasion of a demand for blood-revenge]; and if the arrow returned smeared with blood, they were not content<br>\
save with the retaliation of slaughter; but if it<br>\
returned clean, they stroked their beards, and<br>\
made reconciliation on the condition of the bloodwit; the stroking of the beards being a sign of<br>\
reconciliation: the arrow, however, as IAar says,<br>\
did not [ever] return otherwise than clean: (S,<br>\
O:) the origin was this: a man of the tribe was<br>\
slain, and the slayer was prosecuted for his blood;<br>\
whereupon a company of the chief men [of the<br>\
family of the slayer] collected themselves together<br>\
to the heirs [who claimed satisfaction for the<br>\
blood] of the slain, and offered the bloodwit, asking forgiveness for the blood; and if the heir<br>\
[who claimed satisfaction and who acted for himself and his coheirs] was a strong man, impatient<br>\
of injury, he refused to take the bloodwit; but if<br>\
weak, he consulted the people of his tribe, and<br>\
then said to the petitioners, “We have, between<br>\
us and our Creator, a sign denoting command<br>\
and prohibition: we take an arrow, and set it on<br>\
a bow, and shoot it towards the sky; and if it<br>\
return to us smeared with blood, we are forbidden<br>\
to take the bloodwit, and are not content save<br>\
with the retaliation of slaughter; but if it return<br>\
clean, as it went up, we are commanded to take<br>\
the bloodwit: ” so they made reconciliation; for<br>\
this arrow never returned otherwise than clean;<br>\
and thus they had an excuse in the opinion of the<br>\
ignorant of them. (L, TA.) A poet (S, O, TA)<br>\
of the family of the slain, said by some to be of<br>\
Hudheyl, by IB to be El-As&#39;ar El-Joafee, who<br>\
was absent from this reconciliation, (TA,) says,<br>\
عَقُّوا بِسَهْمٍ ثُمَّ قَالُوا صَالِحُوا<br>\
يَا لَيْتَنِى فِى القَوْمِ إِذْ مَسَحُوا الِلُّحَى<br>\
[They shot an arrow towards the sky; them they<br>\
said, “Make ye reconciliation: ” would that I<br>\
were among the party when they stroked the<br>\
beards]: (S, O, TA:) or, as some relate it, the<br>\
first word is عَقَّوْا, with fet-h to the ق; which belongs to the class of unsound verbs [i. e. to art.<br>\
عقى]. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b5-  One says also, عَقَّ وَالِدَهُ, (S,<br>\
O, K,) or أَبَاهُ, (Msb,) aor.<br>\
عَقُ3َ, (S, O, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
عُقُوقٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and مَعَقَّةٌ (S, O, K) and<br>\
عَقٌّ, (TA,) He was undutiful, disobedient, refractory, or ill-mannered, to his parent, or father;<br>\
contr. of بَرَّهُ; (K;) he broke his compact of obedience to his parent, or father; (TA;) he disobeyed his father; and failed, or neglected, to behave to him in a good, or comely, manner. (Msb.)<br>\
And عَقَّ الرَّحِمَ, (TA, and Ham p. 93,) like قَطَعَهَا<br>\
[i. e. He severed the tie, or ties, of relationship, by<br>\
unkind behaviour to his kindred]. (Ham ib.) And<br>\
عَقَّ [alone], aor.<br>\
عَقُ3َ, inf. n. عُقُوقٌ, [He was undutiful, &amp;c.; or he acted undutifully, &amp;c.; or] he<br>\
contravened, or opposed, him whom he was under<br>\
an obligation to obey. (Har p. 158.) عُقُوقُ<br>\
الوَالِدَيْنِ [Undutiful treatment, &amp;c., of the two<br>\
parents] is said in a trad. to be one of the great<br>\
sins. (O.) And it is said in a prov., العُقُوقُ<br>\
أَحَدُ الثُّكْلَيْنِ [Undutiful treatment of a parent is<br>\
one of the two sorts of being bereft of a child]: or,<br>\
as some relate it, العُقُوقُ ثُكْلُ مَنْ لَمْ يَثْكَلْ [Undutiful treatment of a parent is (like) the bereavement of him who is not (really) bereft of his child]:<br>\
i. e. he whom his children have treated undutifully (مِنْ عَقَّهُ وَلَدُهُ) is as though he were bereft<br>\
of his children although they are living. (O.)<br>\
[See also 3: and 4.] ―<br>\
-b6-  Hence, from عُقُوقُ<br>\
الوَالِدَيْنِ, the verb is metaphorically used in the<br>\
saying, in a trad., مَثَلُكُمْ وَمَثَلُ عَائِشَةَ مَثَلُ العَيْنِ<br>\
فِى الرَّأْسِ تُؤْذِى صَاحِبَهَا وَلَا يَسْتَطِيعُ أَنْ يَعُقَّهَا إِلَّا<br>\
بِالَّذِى هُوَ خَيْرٌ لَهَا (tropical:)  [The similitude of you and of<br>\
&#39;Áïsheh is that of the eye in the head, when it hurts<br>\
its owner, and he cannot treat it severely save with<br>\
that which is good for it: app. meaning that her<br>\
severity was for the good of the objects thereof].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

-A4-<br>\
عَقَّتِ الدَّلْوُ, inf. n. عَقُّ, means The bucket came up<br>\
full from the well; and some of the Arabs say<br>\
عَقَّت as having تَعْقِيَةٌ for its inf. n.; but it is [said<br>\
to be] originally ↓ عَقَّقَت, the third ق being<br>\
changed into ى, [which is then in this case suppressed,] like as they said تَظَنَّيْتُ from الظَّنُّ: [it<br>\
is, however, mentioned in the TA in art. عقو also,<br>\
and there expl. as meaning it rose in the well<br>\
turning round: and from what here follows, it<br>\
appears to mean it rose swiftly, cleaving the air:]<br>\
a poet, cited by IAar, says, of a bucket,<br>\
عَقَّتْ كَمَا عَقَّتْ دَلُوفُ العِقْبَانٌ<br>\
meaning It clave [the air of] the well, rising<br>\
swiftly, like the hastening of the swift eagle in its<br>\
flight towards the prey. (TA in the present art.)<br>\
2<br>\
عَقَّ3َ see above, last sentence.<br>\
3<br>\
عَاقَقْتُ فُلَانًا, aor. أُعَاقُّهُ, inf. n. عِقَاقٌ, I contravened, or opposed, such a one. (TA.) [See also<br>\

-b2-  And<br>\

-A3-  اعقّهُ He made it bitter; (S, O, K;) namely,<br>\
water; said of God; like اقعّهُ. (S, O.) And<br>\

and ↓ عَقَّ [of which latter the aor. is probably<br>\
يَعَقُّ, and the inf. n. عَقَقٌ, said in the K to mean<br>\
اِنْشِقَاقٌ,] signify تَشَقَّقَ and اِنْشَقَّ [as though meaning The lightning became cloven]; (TA;) [but]<br>\
the former is expl. as signifying the lightning was,<br>\
or became, in a state of commotion (تَضَرَّبَ) in the<br>\
clouds. (S, O.) [Another meaning is suggested<br>\
by an explanation of عَقِيقَةٌ (q. v.) in relation to<br>\
lightning.] ―<br>\

عِقٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
عَقَّةٌ A deep excavation, hollow, cavity, trench,<br>\
or the like, in the ground; (K, TA;) as also ↓ عِقٌّ,<br>\
accord. to the K, there said to be with kesr, but<br>\
correctly ↓ عَقٌّ, with fet-h, [q. v.,] which signifies<br>\
an elongated excavation in the ground, and is<br>\
originally an inf. n.; thus in the L. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And A blaze of lightning extending in an elongated form in the sky, (IDrd, O, K,) or in the<br>\

عَقَقٌ: see عَقَاقٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in the K to be<br>\
syn. with عَاقٌّ; but in this sense the correct word<br>\
is عُقَقٌ. (TA.)<br>\
عُقَقٌ: see عُقِيقَةٌ, latter half:<br>\
-A2-  and see also<br>\
عَاقٌّ, in two places.<br>\
عُقُقٌ, as a sing. and as a pl.: see عَاقٌّ.<br>\
عَقَاقٌ is an inf. n. of عَقَّتْ said of a mare (O, K)<br>\
and of an ass: (O:) or it signifies Pregnancy<br>\
(AA, S, K) itself; (K;) as also ↓ عِقَاقٌ, (K,)<br>\
and ↓ عَقَقٌ [which is likewise said to be an inf. n.<br>\
of عَقَّتْ]. (S.) You say, أَظْهَرَتِ الأَتَانُ عَقَاقًا The<br>\
she-ass manifested pregnancy. (AA, S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And, accord. to Esh-Shafi&#39;ee, An embryo; or a<br>\

pregnant after having been covered by the stallion,<br>\
or during a year or two years or some years;<br>\
(K;) or it signifies thus also; (O;) having two<br>\
contr. meanings; (K;) or it is applied to one<br>\
in the latter state as implying a presage of good;<br>\
(O, K;) so says AHát; (O, TA;) i. e., as though<br>\
they meant that she would become pregnant:<br>\
(TA:) it is extr.; [as being from أَعَقَّتْ;] and<br>\
one should not say ↓ مُعِقٌّ; or this is a bad dial.<br>\
var.; (S, O, K;) or, accord. to AA, it is from<br>\
اعقّت, and عَقُوقٌ is from عَقَّتْ: (TA:) the pl. is<br>\
عُقُقٌ, and عِقَاقٌ is a pl. pl., (S, O, K,) i. e. pl. of<br>\
عُقُقٌ. (S, O.) It is said in a prov., طَلَبَ الأَبْلَقَ<br>\
العَقُوقَ, meaning He sought an impossible thing;<br>\
because ابلق is applied to a male, and عقوق<br>\
means pregnant: (S, O, and K in art. بلق) or<br>\
الابلق العقوق means the dawn, because it breaks,<br>\
lit, cleaves. (O, and K in art. بلق.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَوَى<br>\
العَقُوقِ means Date-stones that are easily broken,<br>\
(Lth, S, O, K,) soft to be chewed; (Lth, O, K;)<br>\
which are given as provender to camels, (S,) or<br>\
to the pregnant thereof, in consideration of her<br>\
state, wherefore they are thus called; and which<br>\
are eaten, or chewed, by the old woman; but<br>\
this is of the speech of the people of El Basrah,<br>\
and not known by the Arabs in their desert:<br>\
(Lth, O:) and sometimes they called a single<br>\
date-stone of this sort ↓ عَقِيقَةٌ. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
عَاقٌّ.<br>\
عَقِيقٌ Cleft, split, slit, ripped, or rent; and cut;<br>\
as also ↓ مَعْقُوقٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] Any<br>\
channel which the water of a torrent has cloven<br>\
(S, O, Msb, * K) of old (Msb) and made wide:<br>\
(S, O:) and a valley: (O, K:) pl. أَعِقَّةٌ (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K, TA) and عَقَائِقُ. (TA.) And عَقَائِقُ<br>\
signifies also Pools of water in cleft furrows:<br>\
(AHn, TA:) and some say, red sands. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  See also عَقِيقَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also [Carnelian;] a species of فُصُوص [or stones that are<br>\
set in rings]; (S;) a sort of stone, (Msb,) or red<br>\
خَرَز [meaning precious stones], (O, K,) of which<br>\
فُصُوص are made; (O, Msb;) existing in ElYemen, (K, TA,) near to Esh-Shihr, said by<br>\
Et-Teefáshee to be brought from mines thereof at<br>\
San&#39;à, (TA,) and on the shores of the Sea of<br>\
Roomeeyeh; one kind thereof is of a turbid<br>\
appearance, like water running from salted flesh-meat, and having in it faint white lines, (K, TA,)<br>\
and this, Et-Teefáshee says, is what is known by<br>\
the appellation الرطبى [so in my original]; the<br>\
best kind is the red; then, the yellow; then, the<br>\
white; and the other kinds are bad: or, as some<br>\
say, the streaked (المُشَطَّب) is the best: (TA:)<br>\
[I omit some absurd assertions in the K and TA<br>\
respecting various virtues supposed to be possessed<br>\
by this stone:] the n. un. is with ة: and the pl.<br>\
is عَقَائِقُ. (O, K.) [العَقِيقُ اليَمَانِىُّ is an appel-lation applied by some to The agate.]<br>\
عَقِيقَةٌ [a subst. from عَقِيقٌ, made so by the affix<br>\
ة. Hence, because cleft, or furrowed, in the<br>\
earth,] A river, or rivulet. (IAar, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And A fillet, or bandage, (عِصَابَةٌ,) at the time of<br>\
its being rent from a garment, or piece of cloth.<br>\
(IAar, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The prepuce of a boy<br>\
(AO, IAar, O, K) when he is circumcised. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And [app. because made of cut pieces of skin,]<br>\
A [leathern water-bag such as is commonly called]<br>\
مَزَادَة. (IAar, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also The wool of a<br>\
جَذَع [or sheep in or before its second year]: (S,<br>\
O, K, TA:) that of a ثَنِىّ [or sheep in its third<br>\
year] is called جَنِيبَةٌ: (TA:) and the hair of a<br>\
young one recently born, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,<br>\
TA,) that comes forth upon his head in his<br>\
mother&#39;s belly, (TA,) of human beings, (S, Mgh,<br>\
O, Msb, K, TA,) because it is cut off on his<br>\
seventh day, (Mgh,) and of others, (Msb,) [i. e.]<br>\
of beasts likewise; (S, O, K, TA;) as also ↓ عَقِيقٌ<br>\
and ↓ عِقَّةٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;) but A &#39;Obeyd says<br>\
that he had not heard this last except in relation<br>\
to human beings and asses: (S, O, K: *) its pl.<br>\
(i. e. the pl. of عِقَّةٌ) is عِقَقٌ: (O, K:) [the pl. of<br>\
عَقِيقَةٌ and عَقِيقٌ is عَقَائِقُ: a law of the Sunneh<br>\
requires that the عَقِيقَة of an infant should be<br>\
weighed, and its weight in silver be given to<br>\
the poor: (and Herodotus, in ii. 65, mentions a<br>\
similar custom as obtaining among the Ancient<br>\
Egyptians:)] when the hair has once fallen from<br>\
the young [by its being cut], the term عَقِيقَةٌ ceases<br>\
to be applied to it: so says Lth: (O, TA:) but<br>\
it occurs in a trad. applied to hair as being likened<br>\
to the hair of a recently-born infant. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
Hence, (S, O,) it is applied also to The sheep, or<br>\
goat, [generally the latter,] that is slaughtered (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, K) as a sacrifice for the recentlyborn infant (S, Mgh, Msb) on the occasion of the<br>\
shaving of the infant&#39;s hair (O, K) on the seventh<br>\
day after his birth, (S, Msb,) and of which the<br>\
limbs are divided, and cooked with water and salt,<br>\
and given as food to the poor: (Lth, TA:) Z<br>\
holds it to be thus called from the same word as<br>\
applied to the hair: but it is said [by some] to<br>\
be so called because it is slaughtered by cutting<br>\
the windpipe and gullet and the two external<br>\
jugular veins: (TA:) the Prophet disallowed<br>\
this appellation, (Mgh, Msb,) as being of evil<br>\
omen, (Mgh,) or as though he saw them to<br>\
regard it as of evil omen, (Msb,) and desired<br>\
them to use نَسِيكَةٌ in its stead; (Mgh, Msb, TA;)<br>\
saying I like not العُقُوق. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  عَقِيقَةُ البَرْقِ<br>\
signifies What remains [for an instant] in the<br>\

TA,) wherefore it is said in a trad. that the man<br>\

أَعَقُّ مِنْ ضَبٍّ [More undutiful, &amp;c., to kindred,<br>\
than a lizard of the species called ضبّ] is a prov.<br>\
[mentioned, but not expl., in the O]: IAar says,<br>\
