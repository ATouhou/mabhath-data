عَزَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَزِرَ, inf. n. عَزْرٌ, He prevented, hindered, withheld, or forbade, him; (Mgh, * O, K, *<br>\
TA;) and turned him away, or back; (Mgh, *<br>\
O, TA;) عَنِ الشَّىْءِ from the thing: this is the<br>\
primary signification, from which others, mentioned in the next paragraph, are derived. (TA.)<br>\
See 2, in eight places. ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَزَرْتُ البَعِيرَ. inf. n.<br>\
عَزْرٌ, I tied a cord upon the خَيَاشِيم [app. meaning<br>\
the upper parts of the nostrils] of the camel, and<br>\
then put medicine into his mouth. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And عَزَرَ المَرُأَةَ, (TA,) inf. n. as above, (K,) He<br>\

عزّرهُ, (O, TA,) inf. n. تَعْزِيرٌ, (S, O, K, TA,)<br>\
He disciplined, chastised, corrected, or punished,<br>\
him; (S, O, TA;) meaning he did to him that<br>\
which should turn him away, or back, from evil,<br>\
or foul, conduct. (Ibráheem Es-Seree, O, * TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (S,) He inflicted upon him a<br>\
beating, or flogging, less than that prescribed by<br>\
the law; (S, M, Mgh, * O, Msb, * K;) as also<br>\
↓ عَزَرَهُ, inf. n. عَزْرٌ: (TA: but only the inf. n. of<br>\
the latter verb in this sense is there mentioned:)<br>\
because it prevents the criminal from returning<br>\
to disobedience: but whether this meaning belong<br>\
only to the conventional language of the law or<br>\
be implied in the proper signification, is disputed:<br>\
(TA:) or he beat, or flogged, him with the utmost<br>\
vehemence: (M, K:) or تَعْزِيرٌ signifies [simply]<br>\
the act of beating. (A.) And one says, ضَرَبَهُ<br>\
تَعْزِيرًا, meaning He beat him moderately; not<br>\
exceeding the ordinary bounds. (TA in art. حل.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also He constrained him against his will, عَلَى<br>\
الأَمْرِ to do the thing, (O, K, *) and taught him by<br>\
forbidding him to return to the doing of that which<br>\
was at variance therewith; and so ↓ عَزَرَهُ: (IAar,<br>\
O:) and he taught him the فَرَائِض and أَحْكَام [or<br>\
obligatory statutes or ordinances of God]; (O;)<br>\
or التَّعْزِيرُ, (Az, L,) or ↓ العَزْرُ, (K,) signifies the<br>\
teaching [one] (Az, L, K) religion, (Az, L,) or<br>\
بَاب الدِّين [i. e. the declaration of belief in the<br>\
unity of God and in the mission of Mohammad]<br>\
and the فَرَائِض and أَحْكَام. (L, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And He<br>\
blamed, censured, or reproved, him; as also ↓ عَزَرَهُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَزِرَ, inf. n. عَزْرٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And He aided, or<br>\
assisted, him; as also ↓ عَزَرَهُ, inf. n. as above:<br>\
(K, * TA:) and he strengthened him; (K, * TA;)<br>\
and so ↓ عَزَرَهُ, inf. n. as above. (TA.) He aided<br>\
him against his enemy, or enemies, by repelling the<br>\
latter; (O, TA;) as also ↓ عَزَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَزِرَ and<br>\
عَزُرَ,<br>\
but the former is the more chaste, inf. n. as<br>\
above: (O:) or he did so time after time: or<br>\
with the sword. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And He treated<br>\
him with reverence, veneration, respect, or honour;<br>\
(S, A, O, Msb, K;) and so ↓ عَزَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَزِرَ and<br>\
عَزُرَ,<br>\
inf. n. as above. (O.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Also He abased him;<br>\
rendered him abject, vile, despicable, or ignominious: thus it has two contr. significations. (B,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And He loaded him, namely, an ass. (S.)<br>\
عِزْرَائِيلُ, as some write it, or, as others, عَزْرَائِيلُ,<br>\

known. (MF.)<br>\
عَيْزَارٌ A species of trees. (S, O, L, K.)<br>\

K, *) called the سَبَيْطَر: (S, O:) or it is the<br>\
