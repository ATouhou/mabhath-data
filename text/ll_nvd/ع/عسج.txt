wrong],) and عَسِيجٌ and عَسَجَانٌ, (O, L, TA,)<br>\
He [a camel] stretched out his neck in going along<br>\
[quickly: or went a pace quicker than that termed<br>\
الذَّمِيل, but not so quick as that termed الوَسْجِ:<br>\
see وَسَجَ]. (S, O, L, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَسَجَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَسِجَ, inf. n. عَسَجَانٌ, He (a beast) limped, halted,<br>\
or was slightly lame: so in the M. (TA.)<br>\

And Arab of the desert said, when the lion was<br>\
desiring to devour him, and he [the lion] therefore betook himself to a tree [or shrub] of the<br>\
species termed عَوْسَج,<br>\
يُبْصِرُنِى لَا أَحْسَبُهْ  يَعْسِجُنِى بِالخَوْتَلَهْ<br>\
meaning يَخْتِلُنِى بِالعَوْسَجَةِ يَحْسَبُنِى لَا أُبْصِرُهُ [He<br>\
conceals himself, to seize me, by means of the<br>\
&#39;owsajeh: thinking that I shall not see him:<br>\
the transpositions in the verse being app. meant<br>\
to be understood as occasioned by the terror of<br>\
the man; for the words of the explanation may<br>\
be read so as to have the same metre as those of<br>\
the verse]. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  عَسِجَ المَالُ, [aor.<br>\
عَسَجَ,] The<br>\

camels. (TA.) [See 1, first sentence.]<br>\
عِسْجَةٌ A portion of the night. (O.)<br>\
عَاسِجٌ [part. n. of عَسَجَ]. Dhu-r-Rummeh<br>\
says, describing his she-camel,<br>\
وَالعِيسُ مِنْ عَاسِجٍ أَوْ وَاسِجٍ خَبَبًا<br>\
يُنْحَزْنَ مِنْ جَانِبَيْهَا وَهْىَ تَنْسَلِبُ<br>\
[And the reddish, or yellowish, or dingy, white<br>\
camels, of a sort that goes the pace termed عَسْج, or<br>\
of a sort that goes the pace termed وَسْج, with a quick<br>\
running, are struck with the feet on their sides,<br>\
but she outstrips]: he means, the camels go<br>\
swiftly, struck with the feet in their course, but<br>\
do not overtake my she-camel. (S, O.)<br>\
عَوْسَجٌ [The lycium, or box-thorn; of several<br>\
species; but now particularly applied to the lycium<br>\
Europæum of Linn.: accord. to Sprengel (Hist.<br>\
rei herb. p. 252, as stated by Freytag), applied<br>\
to the zizyphus spina Christi, which is the rhamnus spina Christi of Linn.; but this is the سِدْر:]<br>\
a species of thorn: (S, O, K: *) certain trees of<br>\
the thorn-kind, (L,) having a round red fruit [or<br>\
berry] like the carnelian-bead, (O, L,) which is<br>\
sweet, and is eaten: (O:) or a species of thorntrees having a bitter red fruit in which is acidity,<br>\
called مُصْعٌ: (Msb:) or certain trees having many<br>\
thorns, and of several species, whereof is one that<br>\
produces a red fruit, called مُصْعٌ, in which is<br>\
acidity: (T:) when it grows large, it is called<br>\
غَرْقَدٌ: (O, Msb:) and because of the softness of<br>\
its wood, the women of the Arabs of the desert<br>\
make of it spindles for spinning wool: (O:) the<br>\
n. un. is with ة: (S, O, Msb: [in the K, عَوْسَجٌ<br>\
is termed the pl. of عَوْسَجَةٌ:]) and it is said that<br>\
the pl. of the n. un. is عَوَاسِجُ: (TA:) ISd says,<br>\
the genuine عَوْسَج is short between the knots, hard<br>\
in the wood, small in the leaves, and does not grow<br>\
large, and this is the best sort: thus says AHn:<br>\
(L:) some say that it is the عليق [i. e. عُلَّيْق,<br>\
q. v.]: Dioscorides says, it is a tree that grows<br>\
in tracts that exude water and produce salt,<br>\
having erect thorny branches, and leaves somewhat<br>\
long, overspread with a moist viscous substance:<br>\
and there is another species, whiter than this: and<br>\
another species, of which the leaves are blacker<br>\
than those of the former, and wider, inclining a<br>\
little to redness, and its branches are long, their<br>\
length being about five cubits, and having more<br>\
numerous thorns, and weaker, and less sharp,<br>\
and its fruit is wide and thin, as though it were in<br>\
sheaths: and the عوسج has a fruit like the توث<br>\
[or mulberry], which is eaten: it grows mostly in<br>\
cold, or cool, countries. (Avicenna [Ibn-Seenà],<br>\
book ii. p. 232. [In this extract from Dioscorides,<br>\
in the original, are some unimportant words<br>\
which I have passed over, including two imperfectly printed, and unintelligible: and what is<br>\
said in it respecting the fruit I think doubtful, as<br>\
being inapplicable to the fruit of the box-thorn.])<br>\
مِعْسَاجٌ an epithet applied to a camel [app.<br>\
meaning That stretches out his neck much in going<br>\
along: or that goes the pace termed عَسْج much or<br>\
well]. (S, O, K.)<br>\
