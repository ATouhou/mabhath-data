(O) meaning (tropical:)  And it, i. e. war, will fret [or grind<br>\
or crush] you, as the mill with its skin put beneath it, upon which the flour falls, frets [or grinds]<br>\
the grain; and it, i. e. war, will conceive two<br>\
years, one after the other; then bring forth, and<br>\
give birth to twins: he makes war&#39;s destruction<br>\
of them to be like the mill&#39;s grinding of the<br>\
grain, and the various evils that are engendered from war to be like children. (EM pp.<br>\

TA,) cutting through the skin: (TA:) in which<br>\
case the epithets ↓ عَارِكٌ and ↓ عَرَكْرَكٌ are applied<br>\

اعتركوا, (S, O,) or اعتركوا فِى المَعْرَكَةِ,<br>\

of rag. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
عَرْكٌ, [originally an inf. n.,] accord. to El-<br>\
&#39;Adebbes El-Kinánee, i. q. حَازٌّ, i. e. An incision,<br>\
or a cut, made by the elbow [of a camel], in the<br>\
arm, [probably a mistake for in the side, (see 1,<br>\
near the middle of the paragraph,)] so as to reach<br>\
to the flesh, cutting through the skin, by the side of<br>\
the callous protuberance upon the breast. (O.)<br>\
[See also حَازٌّ, in art. حز.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] ذُو<br>\
عَرْكَيْنِ, as used by a poet, [the dual, it seems,<br>\
being put for the sing. for the sake of the rhyme,<br>\
as it ends a verse,] is a metaphorical term for<br>\

(AA, S, MA, O, K,) meaning a fisherman who<br>\
holds in his hand an iron implement having five<br>\
prongs: (MA:) عَرَكٌ and ↓ عَرَكِىٌّ being like عَرَبٌ<br>\
and عَرَبِىٌّ: (AA, S, O:) [i. e. عَرَكِىٌّ is the n. un.:]<br>\
accord. to the K, عَرَكٌ and عُرُوكٌ are pls. of عَرَكِىٌّ;<br>\
but IAth says that عُرُوكٌ is pl. of عَرَكٌ: (TA:)<br>\
hence عَرَكٌ is used as meaning sailors, or mariners,<br>\
(AA, S, O, K,) because they fish, not as being<br>\
[properly] a name for them: (AA, S, O:) Zuheyr<br>\
says,<br>\
تَغْشَى الحُدَاةُ بِهِمْ حُرَّ الكَثِيبِ كَمَا<br>\
يُغْشِى السَّفَائِنَ مَوْجَ اللُّجَّةِ العَرَكُ<br>\
[The camel-drivers cover with them the middle of<br>\
the elevated expanse of sand like as the seamen<br>\
cause the waves of the deep to cover the ships]:<br>\
but AO related this verse otherwise, saying مَوْجُ,<br>\
in the nom. case, and making العَرَكُ to be an epithet applied to the موج as signifying المُتَلَاطِم [as<br>\
though the meaning were, like as the colliding<br>\
waves of the deep cover the ships with their surf].<br>\
(S, O.)<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. صَوْتٌ [A sound, noise, voice,<br>\
&amp;c.]; and so ↓ عَرِكٌ. (S, O, K.)<br>\

subst. denoted by the phrase عَرَكَ الإِبِلَ فِى الحَمْضِ<br>\
[q. v., app. as meaning The act of leaving camels<br>\
amid the pasturage termed حَمْض, to obtain thereof<br>\
what they want; a meaning given in the O as an<br>\
explanation of ↓ عَرَكْرَكٌ, which is perhaps in this<br>\
instance a mistranscription]. (K.)<br>\
عَرِكٌ A man who throws down, or prostrates,<br>\
his antagonists much, or often; syn. صِرِّيعٌ; (S,<br>\
O;) in the K and in some of the copies of the S<br>\
صَرِيع, like أَمِير; [which is app. a mistranscription;] (TA;) strong, or vehement, (S, * O, * K,<br>\
TA,) in striving, contending, or conflicting, (K,<br>\
TA,) and in might, courage, valour, or prowess,<br>\
(TA,) in war, or battle, (K, TA,) and in altercation; (TA;) as also ↓ مُعَارِكٌ: (K, TA:) pl. of<br>\

عَرِكُوا.)<br>\
-A2-  رَمْلٌ عَرِكٌ and ↓ مُعْرَوْرِكٌ Sand, or<br>\
sands, intermingling; (IDrd, O, K;) as also<br>\
↓ عَرِيكٌ, (L, TA,) which last epithet is erroneously applied in the K to the word رَجُلٌ<br>\
instead of رَمْلٌ, as is also in one instance ↓ مُعْرَوْرِكٌ<br>\
[in the CK in this latter instance written مُعْرَوْرَكٌ].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also عَرَكٌ.<br>\
عَرْكَةٌ as meaning A war, or battle, is postclassical. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  لَقِيتُهُ عَرْكَةً, (S, O, K,) and<br>\
عَرْكَةً بَعْدَ عَرْكَةٍ, and عَرْكَتَيْنِ, (TA,) and عَرَكَاتٍ,<br>\
(S, O, K,) mean I met him once, (S, O, K,) and<br>\
time after time, and twice, (TA,) and several<br>\
times: (S, O, K:) the noun not being used otherwise than adverbially. (TA.)<br>\

used by &#39;Áïsheh in describing her father, (O,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  One who bears, or endures, annoyance, or molestation; or who forgives it, and feigns himself<br>\

vitious, or an immoral, or unrighteous, woman;<br>\
or an adulteress, or a fornicatress. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And A thick, gross, coarse, or rude, woman; as<br>\
also ↓ عَرَكَانِيَّةٌ. (K, TA. [The latter thus expl. in<br>\
the O, and, as is said in the TA, on the authority<br>\
of Ibn-&#39;Abbád: in my MS. copy of the K written<br>\
عَرْكَانِيَّةٌ; and in the CK, عَرَنِيَّة.])<br>\
عَرَكَانِيَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
عِرَاكٌ an inf. n. of 3 [q. v.]. (TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
one says, أَوْرَدَ إِبِلَهُ العِرَاكَ, (S, O, K,) or, as in the<br>\
“ Book ” of Sb, أَرْسَلَهَا العِرَاكَ, (TA,) He made<br>\
his camels to come, or go, to the water together;<br>\
(S, O, K;) the last word being in the accus. case<br>\
after the manner of inf. ns.; (S, O;) originally<br>\
عِرَاكًا; then they prefixed ال, which does not<br>\
change it from its proper state of an inf. n.: (S,<br>\
O, K:) it is like the phrases مَرَرْتُ بِهِمُ الجَمَّآءَ<br>\
الغَفِيرَ and الحَمْدَ لِلّٰهِ: (S, O:) IB says that العِرَاكَ<br>\
and الجَمَّآءَ الغَفِيرَ are in the accus. case as denotatives of state; and الحَمْدَ لِلّٰهِ as the inf. n.: but<br>\
Sb says that they prefix ال to the inf. n. that is<br>\
in the place of the denotative of state. (TA.)<br>\
[See also a similar phrase voce حَقٌّ: and see a<br>\
verse cited voce رِفْهٌ.]<br>\

عُرَاكَةٌ What is drawn from the udder before<br>\
the first فِيقَة [or milk that collects in the udder<br>\
between two milkings], (K,) and before the second<br>\
فيقة collects: also termed عُلَاكَةٌ [perhaps a mistranscription for عُلَالَةٌ] and دُلَاكَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
عَرِيكَةٌ A camel&#39;s hump: or the remainder<br>\
thereof: (K:) or عَرِيكَةُ السَّنَامِ signifies what<br>\
remains of the hump: (ISk, S, O:) so called<br>\
because the purchaser feels that part (يَعْرُكُهُ) to<br>\
know the fatness and strength [of the animal]:<br>\
(TA:) pl. عَرَائِكُ; which is said by some to signify the humps with the backs. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,<br>\
in phrases here following,] (assumed tropical:)  Nature; natural,<br>\
native, or innate, disposition or temper or the<br>\

or subdued; (K, TA;) having little contrariness and aversion: and شَدِيدُ العَرِيكَةِ strong in<br>\
spirit, incompliant, or resisting: (TA:) and لَانَتْ<br>\
عَرِيكَتُهُ His pride, or haughtiness, became broken,<br>\
or subdued: (S, O:) originally relating to the<br>\
camel; for they used to betake themselves to the<br>\
camel when he had the disposition of refusing to<br>\
be ridden or mounted, and incompliance, and cut<br>\
[a part] in his hump, it being high, difficult to<br>\
ride upon; and when this was done, he became<br>\
quiet, and was rendered inclinable, and the part<br>\
of him that was the place of riding became easy<br>\
to sit upon; so one said, قَدْ لَانَتْ عَرِيكَتُهُ (Har<br>\
pp. 566-7.) One says also رَجُلٌ مَيْمُونُ العَرِيكَةِ,<br>\
meaning [A man fortunate, happy, or blest, in<br>\
natural disposition, or] in mind. (TA.)<br>\
