which last and ↓ مَعَابَةٌ may be expl. agreeably<br>\
with analogy as signifying a cause of عَيْب, i. e.<br>\
a thing for which one is to be found fault with,<br>\
blamed, upbraided, or reproached; like مَذَمَّةٌ;]<br>\
for [although] مَفْعل from triliteral-radical verb<br>\
such as كَالَ, aor. يَكِيلُ, as the measure of a subst.<br>\
[or n. of place] is with kesr [to the ع,] and as the<br>\
measure of an inf. n. with fet-h, yet it is allowable<br>\

↓ مَعَابٌ and ↓ مَعِيبٌ: (S, O:) the pl. of عَيْبٌ is<br>\

like the خَرِيطَة [q. v.], of skin, or leather: (Ham<br>\
p. 352:) it has loops with which it is closed and<br>\

4 in art. شرج:)] pl. عِيَبٌ and عِيَابٌ and عَيْبَاتٌ.<br>\

intimates, and the depositary of my secret [or<br>\
secrets]. (TA. [See also other explanations in<br>\
art. كرش.]) And [in like manner] العيَابُ is<br>\
used as meaning (tropical:)  The breasts. and the hearts:<br>\
(O, K:) for, as the Arab deposits in his عيْبَة the<br>\
best of his goods, or utensils, and of his clothes<br>\
so he conceals in his breast his meat particular<br>\
secrets, which may not be divulge. (O, * TA)<br>\
Hence, (TA,) a poet says,<br>\
وَكَادَتْ عِيَابُ الوُدِّ مِنَّا وَمِنْكُمُ<br>\
وَإِنْ قِيلَ أَبْنَآءُ العُمُومَةِ تَصْفَرُ<br>\
[And our and your depositories of love, although<br>\
it be said that we and you are the children of<br>\
paternal uncles, were near to becoming and]: (O,<br>\
TA:) by عياب الودّ he means their breasts. (TA.)<br>\
And بَيْنَنَا وَبَيْنَهُمْ عَيْبَةٌ مَكْفُوفَةٌ, a phrase in the<br>\
treaty of El-Hodeybiyeh. means (tropical:)  Between us and<br>\
them, in respect of this peace, is [determined that<br>\
there shall be, in each party.] a breast bound to<br>\
fulfil the terms of this writing. like the عيبة that<br>\
is closed and fastened by its loops over its contents,] clear of secret enmity, and perfidy, and<br>\
deceit: (IAar, O, * TA:) or, accord. to some, as<br>\
related by Sh, evil between us [and them] shall be<br>\
[as it were] tied up, like as the عيبة is tied up:<br>\
or there shall be mutual reconciliation, and abstaining from war, like that kind of friendship<br>\
that subsists between sincere friends who confide in<br>\
each other. (Az, TA. [See also art. كف.]) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
عَلَيْكَ بِعَيْنَتِكَ, said by &#39;Áïsheh to &#39;Omar on an<br>\
