تَعَظْلَمَ, [from عِظْلِمٌ as signifying a certain plant or dye,] said of the night, It was, or<br>\
became, dark, and very black; (K, TA;) i. e. it<br>\
became like the عِظْلِم. (TA.)<br>\
عِظْلِمٌ, (S, Msb, K,) of which عَظْلَمٌ is a dial.<br>\
var., (MF, TA,) The expressed juice of a species<br>\
of tree or plant, (Az, K, TA,) the colour of which<br>\
is like نِيل [or indigo], green (أَخْضَر) inclining to<br>\
duskiness: (Az, TA:) or a certain plant, (S, K,)<br>\
or thing, (Msb,) with which one dyes, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
said to be (Msb) called in Pers. نِيل [i. e. the<br>\
indigo-plant]: (Msb, and so in some copies of<br>\
the S; other copies of which, for نيل, have تفل:)<br>\
or i. q. وَسْمَةٌ [an appellation now applied to woad;<br>\
as is also عِظْلِم]: (S, Msb, K:) AHn says, one<br>\
of the Arabs of the desert told me that the عظلم<br>\
is the male وَسْمَة: he also says that it is a small<br>\
tree or plant, (شُجَيْرَةٌ), of the [class called] رِبَّة,<br>\
that grows in a late season, and the greenness of<br>\
which is lasting: and in one place he says, an<br>\
Arab of the desert, of the Saráh (السَّرَاة), told me<br>\
that the عِظْلِمَة [which is the n. un.] is a tree or<br>\
plant (شَجَرَةٌ) that rises upon a stem about a cubit<br>\
[in height] and has branches at the extremities of<br>\
which are what resemble the blossoms of the كُزْبَرَة<br>\
[or coriander], and it (the tree or plant) is dustcoloured: (TA:) some say that it is the بِقَّم [or<br>\
Brazil-wood]: (Msb:) MF says, it is the خَطْمِىّ<br>\
[or marsh-mallow]: (TA:) thus says El-Hareeree;<br>\
but El-&#39;Okbaree says that it is not that: (Har<br>\
p. 625:) and some say that it is a certain red<br>\
dye. (TA.) Hence the prov.,<br>\
بَيْضَآءُ لَايُدْجِى سَنَاهَا العِظْلِمُ<br>\
i. e. [A white, or fair, female,] whose whiteness<br>\
[or brightness] عظلم will not blacken [or darken]:<br>\
applied to that which is notable, which nothing<br>\
will conceal. (Meyd, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, as being<br>\
likened thereto, (S,) it signifies also The dark<br>\
night: (S, K:) one says لَيْلٌ عِظْلِمٌ. (TA.)<br>\
عَظْلَمَةٌ Darkness. (K.)<br>\
عِظْلَامٌ Dust; syn. قَتَرَةٌ and غَبَرَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
