عَقڤلَ [The inf. n.] عَقْلٌ signifies The act of withholding, or restraining; syn. مَنْعٌ. (TA.) [This<br>\
is app. the primary signification, or it may be<br>\
from what next follows.] ―<br>\
-b2-  عَقَلَ البَعِيرَ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
عَقِلَ, (S, O, Msb,) inf. n. عَقْلٌ, (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb,) He bound the camel with the [rope<br>\
called] عِقَال; (Mgh;) meaning he bound the<br>\
camel&#39;s fore shank to his arm; (K;) i. e. he<br>\
folded together the camel&#39;s fore shank and his<br>\
arm and bound them both in the middle of the<br>\
arm with the rope called عِقَال; (S, O, Msb;)<br>\
and ↓ اعتقلهُ signifies the same; as also ↓ عقّلهُ;<br>\
(K;) or you say, عَقَّلْتُ الإِبِلَ, from العِقَالُ, (S, O,)<br>\
inf. n. تَعْقِيلٌ, (O,) [i. e. I bound the camels in the<br>\
manner expl. above,] this verb being with tesh-deed because of its application to a number of<br>\
objects: (S, O:) and sometimes the hocks were<br>\
bound with the عِقَال. (TA.) The she-camel,<br>\
also, was bound with the عِقَال on the occasion of<br>\
her being covered: ―<br>\
-b3-  and hence العَقْلُ is metonymically used as meaning الجِمَاعُ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
act of compressing a woman]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عَقَلْتُ<br>\
القَتِيلَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *) or المَقْتُولَ, (S, O,)<br>\
aor. as above, (TA,) and so the inf. n., (Msb, TA,)<br>\
means I gave, or paid, the bloodwit to the heir,<br>\
or next of kin, of the slain person: (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K: *) for the camels [that constituted the<br>\
bloodwit] used to be bound with the عِقَال in the<br>\
yard of the abode of the heir, or next of kin, of<br>\
the slain person; and in consequence of frequency<br>\
of usage, the phrase became employed to mean<br>\
thus when the bloodwit was given in dirhems or<br>\
deenárs. (As, S, O, Msb. * [See a verse cited in<br>\
the first paragraph of art. عيف.]) And [hence]<br>\
one says also, عَقَلْتُ عَنْهُ, (inf. n. as above, TA,)<br>\
meaning I paid for him, (the slayer, Mgh,) i. e.,<br>\
in his stead, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, *) the bloodwit<br>\
that was obligatory upon him, (S, Mgh, O, K, *)<br>\
or what was obligatory upon him of the bloodwit.<br>\
(Msb.) And عَقَلْتُ لَهُ دَمَ فُلَانٍ I relinquished in<br>\
his favour retaliation of the blood of such a one<br>\
for the bloodwit. (S, O, Msb, K. *) لَا تَعْقِلُ العَاقِلَةُ<br>\
عَمْدًا وَلَا عَبْدًا, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) in a trad.<br>\
(S, O, Msb) of Esh-Shaabee, (O,) or a saying of<br>\
Esh-Shaabee, (Mgh, * K,) not a trad., (K,) but<br>\
the like occurs in a trad. related on the authority<br>\
of I&#39;Ab, (TA,) [meaning, accord. to an expl. of<br>\
the verb when trans. without a particle, mentioned<br>\
above, Those who are responsible for the payment<br>\
of a bloodwit in certain cases shall not pay it for<br>\
an intentional act of slaying or the like, nor for<br>\
the slaying or the like of a slave,] applies, accord.<br>\
to Aboo-Haneefeh, to the case of a slave&#39;s committing a crime against a free person: (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K: [and thus as expl. in the Mgh:]) but,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K,) accord. to Ibn-Abee-Leylà, (S,<br>\
O, Msb,) it applies to the case of a free person&#39;s<br>\
committing a crime against a slave; for if the<br>\
meaning were as Aboo-Haneefeh says, the phrase<br>\
would be لَا تَعْقِلُ العَاقِلَةُ عَنْ عَبْدٍ; (S, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
and As pronounced this to be correct: (S, O,<br>\
Msb: *) Akmal-ed-Deen, however, in the Exposition of the Hidáyeh, says that عَقَلْتُهُ is used in<br>\
the sense of عَقَلْتُ عَنْهُ, and that the context of<br>\
the trad. indicates this meaning, which MF also<br>\
defends. (TA.) [See also the saying لَا أَعْقِلُ<br>\
الكَلْبَ الهَرَّارَ in art. هر.] ―<br>\
-b5-  عَقَلَهُ, inf. n. as above,<br>\
also means He set him up [app. a man] on one of<br>\
his legs; [app. from عَقَلَ البَعِيرَ;] as also عَكَلَهُ:<br>\
and every عَقْل is a raising. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also,<br>\
[agreeably with the explanation of the inf. n. in<br>\
the first sentence of this art.,] and ↓ عقّلهُ, and<br>\
↓ تعقّلهُ, (TA, [see also the first paragraph of art.<br>\
عجس,]) and ↓ اعتقلهُ, (Msb, TA,) He withheld<br>\
him, or restrained him, (Msb, TA,) عَنْ حَاجَتِهِ<br>\
from the object of his want. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And<br>\
[hence,] عَقَلَ الدَّوَآءُ بَطْنَهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
عَقِلَ<br>\
(S, K) and<br>\
عَقُلَ, (K,) inf. n. عَقْلٌ, (TA,) The medicine bound, or confined, his belly [or bowels]; syn.<br>\
أَمْسَكَهُ: (S, O, Msb, K:) accord. to some, particularly after looseness: and بَطْنَهُ ↓ اعتقل signifies the same. (TA.) And يَعْقِلُ الطَّبْعَ is said<br>\
of a medicine [as meaning, in like manner, It<br>\
binds the bowels; is astringent]. (TA in art.<br>\
حمض; &amp;c.) And عقل البَطْنُ [app. عُقِلَ] The<br>\
belly [or bowels] became bound, or confined; syn.<br>\
اِسْتَمْسَكَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  عَقَلَ عَلَى القَوْمِ, [aor.<br>\
عَقِلَ,]<br>\
inf. n. عِقَالٌ, means He collected, or exacted, the<br>\
poor-rates of the people, or party; [app. from<br>\
عَقَلَ البَعِيرَ; as though he bound with the rope<br>\
called عِقَال the camels that he collected;] on the<br>\
authority of IKtt. (TA.) &#39;Omar, when he had<br>\
deferred [collecting] the poor-rate in the year [of<br>\
drought called] عَامُ الرَّمَادَةِ, sent Ibn-AbeeDhubáb, and said, اِعْقِلْ عَلَيْهِمْ عِقَالَيْنِ فَاقْسِمْ فِيهِمْ<br>\
عِقَالًا وَاءْتِنِى بِالآخَرِ [Collect thou from them two<br>\
years&#39; poor-rate; then divide among them one<br>\
year&#39;s poor-rate, and bring to me the other]. (O.)<br>\
One says of the collector of the poor-rate, يَعْقِلُ<br>\
الصَّدَقَةَ [He collects, or exacts, the poor-rate].<br>\
(S, O.) ―<br>\
-b9-  عَقَلَ فُلَانًا and ↓ اعتقلهُ signify He<br>\
threw down such a one [in wrestling] by twisting<br>\
his leg upon the latter&#39;s leg: (K, * TA:) [or] you<br>\
say, الشَّغْزَبِيَّةَ ↓ صَارَعَهُ فَاعْتَقَلَهُ He wrestled with<br>\
him and twisted his leg upon the leg of the latter:<br>\
(S, O:) and one says of a wrestler, ↓ لِفُلَانٍ عُقْلَةٌ<br>\
بِهَا النَّاسَ ↓ يَعْتَقِلُ, (S, O,) or يَعْقِلُ بِهَا النَّاسَ, i. e.<br>\
[Such a one has] a [mode of] twisting his leg with<br>\

―<br>\
-b10-  عَقَلَتْ شَعَرَهَا, (inf. n. عَقْلٌ, TA,) said of a<br>\
woman, She combed her hair: (S, O:) or combed<br>\
it in a certain manner; as also ↓ عَقَّلَتْهُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَقَلَ, aor.<br>\
عَقِلَ, inf. n. عَقْلٌ and ↓ مَعْقُولٌ, (S, O,<br>\
K,) or the latter, accord. to Sb, is an epithet, [or<br>\
a pass. part. n.,] for he used to say that no inf. n.<br>\
has the measure مَفْعُولٌ, (S, O,) He was, or became, عَاقِل [i. e. intelligent, &amp;c.; and so ↓ تعقّل;<br>\
as though he were withheld, or restrained, from<br>\
doing that which is not suitable, or befitting:<br>\
see عَقْلٌ below]: and ↓ عقّل, (K, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
تَعْقِيلٌ, (TA,) signifies the same, (K,) or [he possessed much intelligence, for] it is with teshdeed to<br>\
denote muchness: (TA:) and عَقِلَ, aor.<br>\
عَقَلَ, is a<br>\
dial. var. of عَقَلَ, aor.<br>\
عَقِلَ, signifying he became عَاقِل.<br>\
(IKtt, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَقَلَ الشَّىْءَ, (Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَقِلَ, inf. n. عَقْلٌ, (Msb, TA,) He understood,<br>\
or knew, the thing; syn. فَهِمَهُ: (K, TA:) or i. q.<br>\
تَدَبَّرَهُ [app. as meaning he looked into, considered,<br>\
examined, or studied, the thing repeatedly, until he<br>\
knew it]; and عَقِلَ, aor.<br>\
عَقَلَ, is a dial. var. thereof.<br>\
(Msb.) See also 5. ―<br>\
-b3-  مَا أَعْقِلُهُ عَنْكَ شَيْئًا, (S, and<br>\
so in the K accord. to my copy of the TA, but in<br>\
the CK and in my MS. copy of the K ↓ اَعْقَلَهُ,)<br>\
meaning دَعْ عَنْكَ الشَّكَّ [Dismiss from thee doubt],<br>\
is [said to be] mentioned by Sb; as though the<br>\
speaker said, مَا أَعْلِمُ شَيْئًا مِمَّا تَقُولُ فَدَعْ عَنْكَ الشَّكَّ<br>\
[I know not aught of what thou sayest, so dismiss<br>\
from thee doubt]; and [to be] like the phrases خُذْ<br>\
عَنْكَ and سِرْ عَنْكَ: Bekr El-Mázinee says, “I<br>\
asked AZ and As and Aboo-Málik and Akh<br>\
respecting this phrase, and they all said, &#39;We<br>\
know not what it is: &#39; ” (so in the S:) [but] it is<br>\
a mistake, for مَا أَغْفَلَهُ; (K, TA;) and thus it is<br>\
mentioned by Sb and others, with غ and ف.<br>\
(TA.) نَخْلَةٌ لَا تَعْقِلُ الإِبَارَ (tropical:)  A palm-tree that<br>\
will not receive fecundation is a tropical phrase<br>\

O, K) means The woman is on a par with the<br>\
man to the third part of her bloodwit; (S, Mgh,<br>\

مُوضِحَة [or wound of the head for which the<br>\
mulct is five camels] and her مُوضِحَة are equal;<br>\
(K;) but when the portion reaches to the third<br>\
of the bloodwit, her [portion of the] bloodwit is<br>\
the half of that of the man: (S, O, K:) thus, for<br>\
one of her fingers, ten camels are due to her, as<br>\
in the case of the finger of the man; for two of<br>\
her fingers, twenty camels; and for three of her<br>\
fingers, thirty; but for four of her fingers, only<br>\
twenty, because they exceed the third, therefore<br>\
the portion is reduced to the half of what is due<br>\
to the man: so accord. to Ibn-El-Museiyab: but<br>\
Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee and the people of El-Koofeh assign<br>\
for the finger of the woman five camels, and for<br>\

part. (TA.)<br>\

rise with him and his load. (O.)<br>\

it in his mind, abstractedly, and otherwise; and<br>\
so, sometimes, ↓ عَقَلَهُ, aor.<br>\

-A3-  تعقّل as intrans.: see 1,<br>\

-b4-  Said of an animal of the chase, as<br>\
meaning It stuck fast, and became caught, in a<br>\

shall take and give among themselves, or conjointly,<br>\
their former bloodwits]: i. e. they shall be as they<br>\

(S, O,) and النُّهَى, (S,) or النُّهْيَةُ, (O,) or الحِجَا,<br>\
and اللُّبُّ, (Msb,) or العِلْمُ, (K,) or the contr. of<br>\
الحُمْقُ; (M, TA;) or the knowledge of the<br>\
qualities of things, of their goodness and their badness, and their perfectness and their defectiveness;<br>\
or the knowledge of the better of two good things,<br>\
and of the worse of two bad things, or of affairs<br>\
absolutely; or a faculty whereby is the discrimination between the bad and the good; (K, TA;) but<br>\
these and other explanations of العَقْل in the K<br>\
are all in treatises of intellectual things, and not<br>\
mentioned by the leading lexicologists; (TA;<br>\
[in which are added several more explanations of<br>\
a similar kind that have no proper place in this<br>\
work;]) some say that it is an innate property<br>\
by which man is prepared to understand speech;<br>\
(Msb;) the truth is, that it is a spiritual light,<br>\
(K, TA,) shed into the heart and the brain, (TA,)<br>\
whereby the soul acquires the instinctive and speculative kinds of knowledge, and the commencement<br>\
of its existence is on the occasion of the young&#39;s<br>\
becoming in the fætal state, [or rather of its quickening,] after which it continues to increase until<br>\
it becomes complete on the attainment of puberty,<br>\
(K, TA,) or until the attainment of forty years:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. is عُقُولٌ: (K:) Sb mentions عَقْلٌ<br>\
as an instance of an inf. n. having a pl., namely,<br>\
عُقُولٌ; like شُغْلٌ and مَرَضٌ: (TA in art. مرض:)<br>\
IAar says, (O,) العَقْلُ is [syn. with] القَلْبُ, and<br>\
القَلْبُ is [syn. with] العَقْلُ: (O, K:) and ↓ المَعْقُولُ<br>\
is [said to be] a subst., or name, for العَقْلُ, like<br>\
المَجْلُودُ and المَيْسُورُ for الجَلَادَةُ and اليُسْرُ: (Har<br>\
p. 12:) it is said in a prov., ↓ مَا لَهُ جُولٌ وَلَا مَعْقُولٌ,<br>\
(Meyd, and Har ubi suprà,) meaning He has not<br>\
strong purpose of mind, [to withhold, or protect,<br>\
him,] like the جول [or casing] of the well of the<br>\
collapsing whereof one is free from fear because<br>\
of its firmness, nor intellect, or intelligence, (عَقْل,)<br>\
to withhold him from doing that which is not<br>\
suitable to the likes of him. (Meyd. [But see<br>\
مَعْقُولٌ below.]) [Hence, أَسْنَانُ العَقْلِ (see 1 in<br>\
art. حنك) and أَضْرَاسُ العَقْلِ (see ضِرْسٌ), both<br>\
meaning The wisdom-teeth.]<br>\
-A3-  [It is said that]<br>\
عَقْلٌ also signifies A fortress; syn. حِصْنٌ. (K.)<br>\
[But this seems to be doubtful.] See مَعْقِلٌ.<br>\
-A4-<br>\
And A sort of red cloth (S, O, K) with which the<br>\

q. v.] or a sort of figured cloth, (K,) or, as in the<br>\
M, of red figured cloth: (TA:) or such as is<br>\
figured with long forms. (Har p. 416.)<br>\
عُقْلَةٌ A bond like the عِقَال [q. v.]: or a shackle.<br>\
(Har p. 199.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence it seems to signify An<br>\
impediment of any kind.] One says, بِهِ عُقْلَةٌ مِنَ<br>\
السِّحْرِ وَقَدْ عُمِلَتْ لَهُ نُشْرَةٌ [app. meaning In him is<br>\
an impediment arising from enchantment, and a<br>\
charm, or an amulet, has been made for him].<br>\
(S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A [mode of] twisting one&#39;s leg<br>\
with another&#39;s in wrestling. (TA.) See 1, latter<br>\
half. ―<br>\

desires to speak. (Mbr, TA in art. حبس.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And, in the conventional language of the geomancers, (O, K,) it consists of A unit and a<br>\
pair and a unit, (O,) the sign ??: (K, TA:) also<br>\
called ثِقَافٌ. (O, TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
عَقْلِىٌّ Intellectual, as meaning of, or relating<br>\
to, the intellect.]<br>\
عِقَالٌ A rope with which a camel&#39;s fore shank<br>\
is bound to his arm, both being folded together and<br>\
bound in the middle of the arm: pl. عُقُلٌ. (S, O,<br>\
Msb.) [See also شِكَالٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And The poor-rate<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) of a year, (S, Mgh, O, K,)<br>\
consisting of camels and of sheep or goats. (K.)<br>\
[See a verse cited in the first paragraph of art.<br>\
سعو and سعى.] One says, عَلَى بَنِى فُلَانٍ عِقَالَانِ<br>\
On the sons of such a one lies a poor-rate of two<br>\
years. (S, O.) And hence the saying of Aboo-Bekr, لَوْ مَنَعُونِى عِقَالًا (Mgh, O, Msb) If they<br>\
refused me a year&#39;s poor-rate: (Mgh, O:) and it<br>\
is said that the phrase أَخَذَ عِقَالًا was used when<br>\
the collector of the poor-rate took the camels<br>\
themselves, not their price: (TA:) or Aboo-Bekr meant a rope of the kind above mentioned;<br>\
(Mgh, O, Msb;) for when one gave the poor-rate<br>\
of his camels, he gave with them their عُقُل: (O,<br>\
Msb:) or (Mgh, TA) he meant thereby a paltry<br>\
thing, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) of the value of the [rope<br>\
called] عقال: (TA:) or he said عَنَاقًا [“ a she-kid ”]; (Mgh, TA;) so accord. to Bkh, (Mgh,)<br>\
and most others: (TA:) or جُدَيًّا [“ a little kid ”].<br>\
(Mgh, TA.) ―<br>\

made a prisoner, is ransomed with hundreds of<br>\
camels. (K.)<br>\
عَقُولٌ A medicine that binds, confines, or<br>\
astringes, the belly [or bowels]; (S, O, Msb;) as<br>\
also ↓ عَاقُولٌ; contr. of حَادُورٌ. (A in art. حدر.)<br>\
-A2-  See also عَاقِلٌ, latter half, in two places.<br>\
عَقِيلَةٌ A woman of generous race, (S, O, K,)<br>\
modest, or bashful, (S, O,) that is kept behind the<br>\
curtain, (K,) held in high estimation: (TA:) the<br>\
excellent of camels, (Az, S, O, K,) and of other<br>\
things: (Az, TA:) or the most excellent of every<br>\
kind of thing: (S, O, K:) and the chief of a<br>\
people: (K:) the first is the primary signification: then it became used as meaning the excel-lent of any kind of things, substantial, and also<br>\
ideal, as speech, or language: pl. عَقَائِلُ. (TA.)<br>\
And العَقِيلَةُ: (K,) or عَقِيلَةُ البَحْرِ, (S, O, TA,)<br>\
signifies The pearl, or large pearl: (S, O, K, *<br>\
TA: *) or the large and clear pearl: or, accord.<br>\

signify the same, or correctly to signify a natural<br>\

the O,) which occurs in the legs of a beast: (S,<br>\
O:) or a certain disease in the hind leg of a beast,<br>\
such that, when he goes along, he limps, or is<br>\
slightly lame, for a while, after which he stretches<br>\
forth; (K, TA;) accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, (TA,)<br>\
peculiar to the horse; (K, TA;) but it mostly<br>\
occurs in sheep or goats. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  دَآءٌ ذُو عُقَّالٍ<br>\
A disease of which one will not be cured. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عُقَّالُ الكَلَأِ Three herbs that remain after<br>\
having been cut, which are the سَعْدَانَة and the<br>\
حُلَّب and the قُطْبَة. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And عَقَاقِيلُ, [a<br>\
pl.] of which the sing. is not mentioned, [perhaps<br>\
pl. of عُقَّالٌ, but in two senses a pl. of عَقَنْقَلٌ,]<br>\
signifies The portions of a grape-vine that are<br>\
raised and supported upon a trellis or the like.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عُقَّيْلَى Grapes in their first, sour, state.<br>\

أَخَذَهُ العِقِّيلَى i. q. شَغْزَبَهُ and شَغْرَبَهُ. (AZ, TA<br>\
in art. شغزب.)<br>\
عَاقِلٌ [act. part. n. of عَقَلَ: and as such,] The<br>\
payer of a bloodwit: pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]<br>\
↓ عَاقِلَةٌ: (Msb:) the latter is an epithet in which<br>\
the quality of a subst. predominates; (TA;) and<br>\
signifies a man&#39;s party (S, Mgh, O, K, TA) who<br>\
league together to defend one another, (S, O, K,<br>\
TA,) consisting of the relations on the father&#39;s<br>\
side, (S, Mgh, * O, TA,) who pay the bloodwit<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, TA) [app. in conjunction with the<br>\
slayer] for him who has been slain unintentionally:<br>\
(S, O, TA:) it was decided by the Prophet that<br>\
it was to be paid in three years, to the heirs of<br>\
the person slain: (TA:) they look to the offender&#39;s<br>\
brothers on the father&#39;s side, who, if they take it<br>\
upon them, pay it in three years: if they do not<br>\
take it upon them, the debt is transferred to the<br>\
sons [meaning all the male descendants] of his<br>\
grandfather; and in default of their doing so, to<br>\
those of his father&#39;s grandfather; and in default<br>\
of their doing so, to those of his grandfather&#39;s<br>\
grandfather; and so on: it is not transferred<br>\
from any one of these classes unless they are<br>\
unable [to pay it]: and such as are enrolled in a<br>\
register [of soldiers or pensioners or any corporation] are alike in respect of the bloodwit: (IAth,<br>\
TA:) or, accord. to the people of El-&#39;Irák, it<br>\
means the persons enrolled in the registers [of soldiers or of others]: (S, O:) or it is applied to the<br>\
persons of the register which was that of the<br>\
slayer; who derive their subsistence-money, or<br>\
allowances, from the revenues of a particular<br>\
register: (Mgh:) Ahmad Ibn-Hambal is related<br>\
to have said to Is-hák Ibn-Mansoor, it is applied<br>\
to the tribe (قَبِيلَة) [of the slayer]; but that they<br>\
bear responsibility [only] in proportion to their<br>\
ability; and that if there is no عَاقِلَة, it [i. e. the<br>\
bloodwit] is not to be from the property of the<br>\
offender; but Is-hák says that in this case it is<br>\
to be from the treasury of the state, the bloodwit<br>\
not being [in any case] made a thing of no<br>\
account: (TA:) the pl. of عَاقِلَةٌ thus applied is<br>\
عَوَاقِلُ. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  عَاقِلٌ also signifies Having,<br>\
or possessing, عَقْل [i. e. intelligence, understanding,<br>\
&amp;c.; or intelligent, &amp;c.; a rational being]; (S,<br>\
O, Msb, K;) and so ↓ عَقُولٌ, (S, O, K,) or this<br>\
latter has an intensive signification [i. e. having<br>\
much intelligence &amp;c.]: (TA: [see an ex. in a<br>\
saying cited voce أَبْلَهُ, in art. بله:]) the former<br>\
is expl. by some as applied to a man who<br>\
withholds, or restrains, and turns back, his<br>\
soul from its inclinations, or blamable inclinations: (TA:) and it is likewise applied to a<br>\
woman, as also عَاقِلَةٌ: (Msb:) the pl. masc. is<br>\
عُقَّالٌ and عُقَلَآءُ, (Msb, K,) this latter pl. sometimes used; and the pl. fem. is عَوَاقِلُ and عَاقِلَاتٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَاقِلٌ is also applied to a mountaingoat, as an epithet, signifying That protects himself in his mountain from the hunter: (TA:) [and<br>\
in like manner ↓ عَقُولٌ is said by Freytag to be<br>\
used in the Deewán of Jereer.] And it is [also]<br>\
a name for A mountain-goat, (S, O,) or a gazelle;<br>\
(K;) because it renders itself inaccessible in a<br>\
high mountain. (S, O, K. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَاقِلَةٌ signifies A female comber of the hair. (S, O.)<br>\
عَاقِلَةٌ, as a coll. gen. n.: see عَاقِلٌ; of which it<br>\
is also fem.<br>\
عَاقُولٌ: see عَقُولٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also A bent portion, (S,<br>\
O,) or place of bending, (K,) of a river, and of a<br>\
valley, (S, O, K,) and of sand: (S, O:) pl. عَوَاقِيلُ:<br>\
or the عَوَاقِيل of valleys are the angles, in the<br>\
places of bending, thereof; and the sing. is عَاقُولٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The main of the sea: or the waves<br>\
thereof. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A land in which (so in<br>\
copies of the K, but in some of them to which,)<br>\
one will not find the right way, (K, TA,) because<br>\
of its many places of winding. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,]<br>\
عَوَاقِيلُ الأُمُورِ What are confused and dubious of<br>\
affairs. (S, O, K. *) ―<br>\
-b5-  And [hence] one says,<br>\
إِنَّهُ لَذُو عَوَاقِيلَ, meaning Verily he is an author,<br>\
or a doer, of evil. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also A certain<br>\
plant, (O, K,) well known, (K,) not mentioned<br>\
by AHn (O, TA) in the Book of Plants; (TA;)<br>\
[the prickly hedysarum; hedysarum alhagi of<br>\
Linn.; common in Egypt, and there called by<br>\
this name; fully described by Forskål in his<br>\
Flora Aegypt. Arab., p. 136;] it has thorns;<br>\
camels pasture upon it; and [hence] it is called<br>\
شَوْكُ الجِمَالِ; it grows upon the dykes and the<br>\
تُرَع [or canals for irrigation]; and has a violetcoloured flower. (TA.) [See also تَرَنْجُبِينٌ;<br>\
and see حَاجٌ, in art. حيج.]<br>\

and elevated tract] of sand, having winding portions, and حِرَف [app. meaning ridges], and compacted: (TA:) accord. to El-Ahmar, it is the<br>\
largest quantity of sand; larger than the كَثِيب:<br>\
(S voce لَبَبٌ:) pl. عَقَاقِلُ (S, O) and عَقَاقِيلُ (O)<br>\
and عَقَنْقَلَاتٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\

or the [portion of fat termed] كُشْيَة of the ضَبّ.<br>\
(TA.) أَطْعِمْ أَخَاكَ مِنْ عَقَنْقَلِ الضَّبِّ [Give thy<br>\
brother to eat of the intestines, &amp;c., of the dabb:<br>\
or, as some relate it, مِنْ كُشْيَةِ الضَّبِّ:] is a<br>\

مَعْقِلٌ A place to which one betakes himself for<br>\
refuge, protection, preservation, covert, or lodging;<br>\
syn. مَلْجَأٌ; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ عَقْلٌ,<br>\
(S, O, K,) of which the pl. is عُقُولٌ: (S, O:) but<br>\
Az says that he had not heard عَقْل in this sense<br>\
on any authority except that of Lth; and held<br>\
العُقُولُ, which is cited as an ex. of its pl., to signify “ the protecting oneself in a mountain: ”<br>\
(TA:) and مَعْقِلٌ signifies also a fortress; [like<br>\
as عَقْلٌ is said to do;] syn. حِصْنٌ: (Mgh:) the<br>\
pl. is مَعَاقِلُ. (TA.) Hence one says, using it<br>\
metaphorically, هُوَ مَعْقِلُ قَوْمِهِ (tropical:)  He is the refuge<br>\
of his people: and the kings of Himyer are<br>\
termed in a trad. مَعَاقِلُ الأَرْضِ, meaning The<br>\
fortresses [or refuges] of the land. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[It is perhaps primarily used in relation to<br>\

which the camels are bound with the rope called<br>\
عِقَال. (TA.)<br>\
مَعْقُلَةٌ and مَعْقَلَةٌ; and the pl.: see عَقْلٌ, first<br>\

ripe dates,] of El-Basrah: (Msb:) so called in<br>\
relation to Maakil Ibn-Yesár. (S, Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
مُعَقَّلَةٌ is applied to camels (إِبِلٌ) as meaning<br>\
Bound with the rope called عِقَال. (O, TA.) And<br>\
also to a she-camel bound therewith on the occasion of her being covered: and hence the epithet<br>\
مُعَقَّلَاتٌ is applied by a poet, metonymically, to<br>\
women, in a similar sense. (TA.)<br>\
مَعْقُولٌ [pass. part. n. of عَقَلَ in all its senses as<br>\
a trans. verb. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence it signifies Intellectual,<br>\
