عَدَالَةٌ and عُدُولَةٌ, (K, * TK,) He acted equitably,<br>\
justly, or rightly. (S, O, Msb, K.) So in the<br>\
phrase عَدَلَ فِى أَمْرِهِ, [He acted equitably, &amp;c.,<br>\
in his affair,] inf. n. عَدْلٌ. (Msb.) And so in<br>\
the phrase عَدَلَ عَلَيْهِ فِى القَضِيَّةِ [He acted equitably, &amp;c., towards him in the judgment]: (S, O:)<br>\
and عَدَلَ عَلَى القَوْمِ, [he acted equitably, &amp;c., towards the people, or party,] inf. n. عَدْلٌ and<br>\
مَعْدِلَةٌ and مَعْدَلَةٌ. (Msb.) لَنْ تَسْتَطِيعُوا أَنْ<br>\
تَعْدِلُوا بَيْنَ النِّسَآءِ, [Ye will not be able to act with<br>\
perfect equity between women], in the Kur [iv.<br>\
128], is said to mean, in respect of love, and of<br>\
جِمَاع. (TA.) [See also عَدْلٌ below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  وَإِنْ<br>\
تَعْدِلْ كُلَّ عَدْلٍ, in the Kur [vi. 69], means And<br>\
if it would ransom with every [degree of] ransoming: (T, S, O, Msb, TA:) AO used to say, and<br>\
if it would act equitably with every [degree of] equitable acting; but Az says that this is a blunder.<br>\
(TA.) [See, again, عَدْلٌ below.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [عَدَلَ signifies also He declined, deviated, or turned aside or<br>\
away; and particularly from the right course:<br>\
thus having a meaning nearly agreeing with that<br>\
assigned to عَدِلَ in the last sentence of this paragraph.] بَلْ هُمْ قَوْمٌ يَعْدِلُونَ, in the Kur [xxvii.<br>\
61], means [Nay but they are a people] who decline,<br>\
or deviate, from the truth, and from the right<br>\
course; i. e., who disbelieve. (O.) And one says,<br>\
عَدَلَ عَنْهُ, aor.<br>\
عَدِلَ, inf. n. عَدْلٌ and [more com-<br>\
monly] عُدُولٌ, He declined, deviated, or turned<br>\

Msb;) as also عَنْهُ ↓ انعدل. (S, O, K. *) And<br>\

And عَدَلَ الفَحْلُ (S, O, K) عَنِ الإِبِلِ (S, O) The<br>\
stallion left, left off, or desisted from, covering the<br>\
she-camels; (S, O, K; *) and so عَنِ الضِّرَابِ ↓ انعدل.<br>\
(TA.) [عَدَلَ الفَحْلَ see in what follows.] And<br>\
عَدَلَ إِلَيْهِ, inf. n. عُدُولٌ, He returned to him, or<br>\
it. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  عَدَلَهُ: see 2, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  عَدَلَ<br>\
فُلَانًا بِفُلَانٍ He made such a one to be equal, or<br>\
like, to such a one; (K;) [and] so به ↓ عادلهُ:<br>\
(S:) or, accord. to some, العَدْلُ signifies the<br>\
rating a thing as equal to a thing of another kind<br>\
so as to make it like the latter. (TA.) One says,<br>\
عَدَلْتُ هٰذَا بِهٰذَا I made this to be like and to<br>\
stand in the stead of, this. (Msb.) And عَدَلَ<br>\
بِرَبِّهِ, (El-Ahmar, TA,) aor.<br>\
عَدِلَ, (S, O, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. عَدْلٌ and عُدُولٌ, [غَيْرَهُ being understood,]<br>\

in the Kur [vi. 151, and accord. to some in vi. 1],<br>\
means Attributing a copartner, or copartners,<br>\
to their Lord. (O. [And the like is said in the<br>\
S and Msb and TA.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  عَدَلْتُ أَمْتِعَةَ البَيْتِ I<br>\
made the goods, or furniture, of the house, or tent,<br>\
into equal loads, [so as to counterbalance one<br>\
another,] on the day of departure, or removal.<br>\
(TA.) And بَيْنَ الشَّيْئَيْنِ ↓ عَادَلَ (S, O, TA) He<br>\
made an equiponderance to subsist between the two<br>\
things. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  فُلَانٌ يَعْدِلُ فُلَانًا Such a one is<br>\
equal to such a one. (TA.) And يَعْدِلُهُ He, or<br>\
it, is like him, or it. (Fr, S, O.) [Hence] one<br>\
says, مَا يَعْدِلُكَ عِنْدَنَا شَىْءٌ Nothing stands with<br>\
us in thy stead. (TA.) And عَدَلَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَدِلَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. عَدْلٌ, (TA,) It was, or became, equiponderant to it; as also ↓ عادلهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُعَادَلَةٌ.<br>\
(TA.) And [hence] عَدَلَهُ فِى المَحْمِلِ, (K,) and<br>\

called] محمل [so as to counterbalance him].<br>\
(K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And عَدَلَ, aor.<br>\
عَدِلَ, inf. n. عَدْلٌ,<br>\
signifies also He turned a thing from its course,<br>\
direction, or manner of being. (TA.) You say,<br>\
عَدَلْتُ فُلَانًا عَنْ طَرِيقِهِ I turned such a one from<br>\
his road, or way. (TA.) And لَا تُعْدَلُ سَارِحَتُكُمْ<br>\
Your pasturing cattle shall not be turned away,<br>\
nor prevented, from pasturing. (TA, from a<br>\
trad.) And عَدَلَ الفَحْلَ (K, TA) عَنِ الضِّرَابِ<br>\
(TA) He removed the stallion, or made him to<br>\
withdraw [or desist], from covering. (K, TA.)<br>\
And عَدَلْتُ الدَّابَّةَ إِلَى مَوْضِعِ كَذَا I turned the<br>\
beast to such a place. (TA.) [See also two meanings assigned to this verb in the next paragraph,<br>\
third sentence.]<br>\
-A3-  عَدُلَ, [aor.<br>\
عَدُلَ,] inf. n. عَدَالَةٌ (S,<br>\
O, Msb) and عُدُولَةٌ, (Msb,) He (a man, S, O,<br>\
i. e. a witness, Msb) was, or became, such as is<br>\
termed عَدْل [q. v.]. (S, O, Msb.)<br>\
-A4-  عَدِلَ, aor.<br>\
عَدَلَ,<br>\
inf. n. عَدَلٌ, He acted wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically. (Msb.)<br>\

(TA;) right, or in a right condition; direct, or<br>\
rightly directed; (S, O, Msb, K, TA;) and so<br>\
↓ عَدَلَهُ. (O, K.) Hence, فَعَدَّلَكَ and ↓ فَعَدَلَكَ,<br>\
accord. to different readers, in the Kur [lxxxii. 7,<br>\
which I would rather render And hath made<br>\
thee symmetrical]: (O:) or the latter means<br>\
and hath turned thee from unbelief to belief;<br>\
(IAar, O, TA;) or, accord. to Fr, and hath<br>\
turned thee to whatever form He pleased, beautiful or ugly, tall or short: but Az says that the<br>\
former reading was the more pleasing to Fr, and<br>\
is the better. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He made it equal;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) namely, a pair of scales,<br>\
or a weight, (K, TA,) and a measure, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
Hence, قِسْمَةُ التَّعْدِيلِ i. e. The division of a thing<br>\
[in an equal manner] with regard to the value<br>\
and utility, not with regard to the quantity, so<br>\
that the smaller portion may be equal to the<br>\
larger portion in value and utility. (Msb.) You<br>\
say, عَدَّلَ القَسَّامُ الأَنْصِبَآءَ لِلْقَسْمِ بَيْنَ الشُّرَكَآءِ i. e.<br>\
[The divider of inheritances] made equal the<br>\
shares [for distribution among the participators].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عدّل الشِّعْرَ He made the poetry, or<br>\
verse, to be right in measure. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  تَعْدِيلُ<br>\
أَرْكَانِ الصَّلَاةِ means The making the limbs, or<br>\
members, to be still, in the bowing of the head and<br>\
body, and in the prostration, and in the standing<br>\
between these two acts, and in the sitting between<br>\
the two prostrations. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b6-  عدّلهُ signifies<br>\
also He attributed to him (i. e. a witness, Msb)<br>\
what is termed عَدَالَة [inf. n. of عَدُلَ]; (O,<br>\
Msb;) described him as possessing that quality;<br>\
(Msb;) pronounced him to be veracious, and<br>\
good, or righteous; (K;) pronounced him to be<br>\
such as is termed عَدْل [q. v.]: (TA:) تَعْدِيلُ<br>\
الشُّهُودِ is the pronouncing the witnesses to be عُدُول<br>\
[pl. of عَدْلٌ]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b7-  عدّل أَمْرَهُ: and عَدَّلْتُ بَيْنَهُمَا:<br>\
see 3. ―<br>\
-b8-  شَرِبَ حَتَّى عَدَّلَ He drank until he became full: (Aboo-&#39;Adnán, O, TA:) or until his<br>\
belly became like the [load called] عِدْل. (K.)<br>\
3<br>\
عَاْدَلَ see 1, in four places. One says, يُعَادِلُ فِى<br>\
الوَزْنِ [It is equal in weight; is equiponderant].<br>\
(IF, Msb.) And يُعَادِلُكَ فِى الوَزْنِ وَالقَدْرِ [He is<br>\
equal to thee in weight and in size: as one who<br>\
rides with thee in a مَحْمِل]. (S.) يُعَادِلُهُ فِى<br>\
القِيمَةِ وَالمَنْفَعَةِ [It is equal to it in value and<br>\
utility]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَادَلَهُمَا عَلَى نَاضِحٍ He<br>\
bound them two upon the two sides of a camel [or<br>\
of a camel used for carrying water for irrigation,<br>\
so that they counterbalanced each other] like the<br>\
[two loads called] عِدْلَانِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فُلَانٌ<br>\
يُعَادِلُ أَمْرَهُ, and يُقَسِّمُهُ, (O, and so accord. to a<br>\
copy of the S,) or عَدَالٌ, (so in another copy of<br>\
the S,) inf. n. يُعَادِلُ هٰذَا الأَمْرَ, Such a one wavers, or vacillates, [in his case] between two affairs, hesitating<br>\
which of them he shall do. (S, O.) And عادل أَمْرَهُ<br>\
تَعْدِيلٌ He is in a state of entanglement<br>\
in this affair, and does not execute it: (K:) he<br>\
is in doubt respecting it. (TA.) And عادل أَمْرَهُ<br>\
He paused [in his case], hesitating between two<br>\
affairs, which he should do; as also ↓ عدّلهُ inf. n.<br>\
تَعْدِيلٌ: and hence, in the trad. of the مِعْرَاج [or<br>\
ladder by which Mohammad is related to have<br>\
ascended from Jerusalem to Heaven], ↓ فَعَدَّلْتُ<br>\
بَيْنَهُمَا [And I paused in hesitation between them<br>\
two]; meaning that they were equal in his estimation, and he could not make choice of either<br>\
of them. (TA.) And عَادَلْتُ بَيْنَ أَمْرَيْنِ أَيَّهُمَا<br>\
آتِى I wavered, or vacillated, between two affairs,<br>\
hesitating which of them I should do. (TA.)<br>\
المُعَادَلَةُ is The doubting respecting two affairs:<br>\
and one says, أَنَا فِى عِدَالٍ مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ I am in<br>\
doubt respecting this affair, whether I should do<br>\
it or leave it undone: (TA:) or العِدَالُ is the<br>\
considering deliberately respecting the case of two<br>\
affairs that have occurred to one, when one knows<br>\
not to which of them he should betake himself.<br>\
(IAar, K.) And The case of one person&#39;s saying<br>\
“ There is in it something remaining ” and another&#39;s saying “ There is not in it anything remaining. ” (S, O.) And one says, when he wavers,<br>\
or vacillates, between two affairs, hesitating which<br>\
of them he shall do, and then a right opinion<br>\
occurs to him, and he determines upon that which<br>\
is the more fit in his estimation, قَطَعْتُ العِدَالَ<br>\
فِى أَمْرِى وَمَضَيْتُ عَلَى عَزْمِى [I cut short wavering in my affair, and executed my determination]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عادل signifies also It became crooked, or bent. (K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعدّل It became, or was rendered, straight,<br>\
or even; syn. تَقَوَّمَ. (Msb in art. قوم.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
تَعَدَّلَتْ قِيمَةُ المَتَاعِ بِكَذَا The value of the commodity was equal to such a thing; syn. قَامَ المَتَاعُ بِكَذَا.<br>\
(Msb in art. قوم.)<br>\

You say, تَعَادَلَا [They two became equal]. (M<br>\

-b2-  [Also The<br>\
being, or becoming, intermediate in quality.]<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْعَدَلَ see 1, former half, in two places.<br>\
8<br>\
اعتدل It was, or became, right, or in a<br>\
right condition; direct, or rightly directed;<br>\
straight, or even; (S, O, Msb, TA;) equal; (as<br>\
a pair of scales, or a weight, and a measure, &amp;c.;<br>\
TA;) equable, or uniform; (Msb, TA;) [symmetrical, proportionate,] suitable in itself [or in its<br>\
parts]. (K.) The saying, cited by Sh,<br>\
وَاعْتَدَلَتْ ذَاتُ السَّنَامِ الأَمْيَلِ<br>\
means And she that had an inclining hump became straight [and erect] in her hump by reason<br>\
of fatness. (TA.) And one says جَارِيَةٌ حَسَنَةُ<br>\
الاِعْتِدَالِ A girl, or young woman, goodly in respect<br>\
of stature [or proportion]. (A, TA.) And اعتدل<br>\
الشِّعْرُ The poetry, or verse, was, or became,<br>\
measured, and right in its feet. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
It was, or became, of a middling sort, in quantity,<br>\
or quality; (K, TA;) as a body between tallness<br>\
and shortness, and water between the hot and the<br>\

عَدْلٌ Equity, justice, or rectitude; contr. of<br>\
جَوْرٌ; (S, O, Msb, K, TA;) i. e. i. q. قَصْدٌ, in<br>\
affairs; (Msb;) and قِسْطٌ; (S, M, Mgh, &amp;c., in<br>\
art. قسط;) and سَوِيَّةٌ; (O, K;) and اِسْتِقَامَةٌ;<br>\

minds as being right; (K, TA;) as also ↓ مَعْدِلَةٌ<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ مَعْدَلَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and<br>\
↓ عَدَالَةٌ and ↓ عُدُولَةٌ: (K:) or, as some say, it is<br>\
the mean between excess and falling short: and<br>\
Er-Rághib says, it is of two sorts: one is absolute, such that reason requires the inference of its<br>\
goodness; and this will not at any time be abrogated, nor described as a mode of transgression;<br>\
as the doing good to him who does good to thee,<br>\
and the abstaining from harming him who abstains from harming thee: and the other is such<br>\
as is known to be عَدْل by the law; and this may<br>\
be abrogated sometimes; as retaliation, and fines<br>\
for wounds and maimings, and the taking the<br>\
property of the apostate; and this is what is<br>\
meant by the saying in the Kur [xvi. 92], إِنَّ اللّٰهَ<br>\
يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالْإِحْسَانِ i. e. [Verily God commandeth] equality in recompensing, if good, with<br>\
good, and if evil, with evil, and the requiting of<br>\
good with more good, and of evil with less evil:<br>\
[see also 4 in art. حسن:] and he says of ↓ عَدَالَةٌ<br>\
and ↓ مَعْدِلَةٌ, that each is a term requiring the<br>\
inference of equality, and is used with a regard to<br>\
correlation. (TA.) One says, بَسَطَ الوَالِى عَدْلَهُ<br>\
and ↓ مَعْدِلَتَهُ (S, O) and ↓ مَعْدَلَتَهُ (S) [The<br>\
governor, or ruler, largely extended his equity, or<br>\
justice]. And ↓ فُلَانٌ مِنْ أَهْلِ المَعْدَلَةِ, (S,) or<br>\
↓ المَعْدِلَةِ, (O,) i. e. من اهل العَدْلِ [Such a one<br>\
is of the people of equity, &amp;c.]. (S, O.) وَأَشْهِدُوا<br>\
ذَوَىْ عَدْلٍ مِنْكُمْ, in the Kur [lxv. 2], is said by<br>\
Sa&#39;eed Ibn-El-Museiyib to mean ذَوَىْ عَقْلٍ [i. e.<br>\
And make ye to be witnesses two persons of intelligence from among you: but this rendering I<br>\
think questionable]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Repayment,<br>\
requital, compensation, or recompense. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And Ransom, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) when regard<br>\
is had therein to the meaning of equality, or equivalence. (TA.) This is [said to be] the meaning in<br>\
the phrase of the Kur [v. 96], أَوْ عَدْلُ ذٰلِكَ صِيَامًا<br>\
[Or the ransom thereof by fasting: but this is<br>\
generally expl. as meaning or the like thereof of<br>\
fasting; (see عِدْلٌ;) i. e., in lieu of feeding a<br>\
number of poor men, one shall fast the like<br>\
number of days]. (S, O.) And so [accord. to<br>\
some] in the saying, occurring in a trad., لَا يُقْبَلُ<br>\
مِنْهُ صَرْفٌ وَلَا عَدْلٌ [of which see various explanations (including three renderings here following) in art. صرف]. (O, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And Measure;<br>\
syn. كَيْلٌ. (K.) So in the phrase أَعْطَاهُ بِالعَدْلِ<br>\
[He gave him by measure]. (TK.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And An<br>\
obligatory act or divine ordinance. (En-Nadr,<br>\
O, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And A supererogatory act. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also One who acts equitably, justly, or rightly;<br>\
and so ↓ عَادِلٌ: (K, TA:) or the latter signifies<br>\
thus: (S, O:) and the former [particularly] signifies a man approved and satisfactory in testimony; originally an inf. n.; (S, O, TA;) whose<br>\
testimony is approved and available; (Msb;) a<br>\
man whose testimony is allowable, or legally admissible, as also ↓ عَادِلٌ; a man whose saying, and<br>\
whose judgment, or judicial decision, are approved;<br>\
and, accord. to Ibráheem, one from whom a thing<br>\
occasioning doubt, or suspicion, or evil opinion,<br>\
has not appeared: being originally an inf. n., it<br>\
means ذُو عَدْلٍ: or, accord. to IJ, it is an intensive epithet, as though meaning possessing<br>\
every kind of عَدْل: (TA:) one says رَجُلٌ عَدْلٌ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, * K,) and اِمْرَأَةٌ عَدْلٌ and عَدْلَةٌ,<br>\
(Msb, K,) the latter mentioned by IJ, (TA,)<br>\
and رَجُلَانِ عَدْلٌ and عَدْلَانِ, (Msb, * TA,) and<br>\
قَوْمٌ عَدْلٌ (S, O, Msb, * K) and نِسْوَةٌ عَدْلٌ (TA)<br>\
and قَوْمٌ عُدُولٌ, (S, O, Msb, * K,) عُدُولٌ being pl.<br>\
of عَدْلٌ, (S, O, Msb,) or of عَادِلٌ, (K,) and عَدْلٌ<br>\
used in a pl. sense being a quasi-pl. n. of عَادِلٌ,<br>\
(M, K,) like تَجْرٌ [of تَاجِرٌ] and شَرْبٌ [of شَارِبٌ];<br>\
(M, TA;) or رِجَالٌ عَدْلٌ and نِسْوَةٌ عَدْلٌ mean<br>\
رِجَالٌ ذَوُو عَدْلٍ and نِسْوَانٌ ذَوَاتُ عَدْلٍ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
العَدْلُ as one of the names of God means He<br>\
whom desire does not cause to incline, or decline,<br>\
so that he should deviate from the right course<br>\
in judgment. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And one says, هٰذَا عَدْلٌ<br>\
بَيْنَهُمَا, meaning This is intermediate in quality<br>\
between them two, not in the utmost degree of<br>\
goodness nor in the extreme degree of badness.<br>\
(Mgh.) And مَكَانٌ عَدْلٌ بَيْنَ فَرِيقَيْنِ [A place<br>\
equidistant, or midway, between two parties]. (S<br>\
in art. سوى.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also عِدْلٌ, throughout the<br>\
greater part of the paragraph.<br>\
-A3-  عَدْلٌ is also the<br>\
name of a certain chief of the [body of armed men<br>\
called] شُرَط, (S, O,) or شُرْطَة, (K,) of a تُبَّع [or<br>\
King of El-Yemen], who, when he desired the<br>\
slaughter of a man, delivered him to this person;<br>\
(S, O, K;) whereupon the people said, وُضِعَ عَلَى<br>\
يَدَىْ عَدْلٍ [He has been consigned to the hands of<br>\
&#39;Adl]; (S, O;) and this was afterwards said of<br>\
anything of which one despaired. (S, O, K.)<br>\
[Meyd mentions عَلَى يَدَىْ عَدْلٍ, as a prov.,<br>\
without وُضِعَ: see Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 80.]<br>\
عِدْلٌ The like (IAar, Zj, O, K) of a thing;<br>\
(IAar, O;) as also ↓ عَدْلٌ; syn. مِثْلٌ; (IAar,<br>\
Zj, O, K;) and نَظِيرٌ [which signifies the same,<br>\
or the equal]; and so ↓ عَدِيلٌ: (K:) or, accord.<br>\
to Er-Rághib, ↓ عَدْلٌ and عِدْلٌ are nearly the<br>\
same; but the former is used in relation to what<br>\
is perceived mentally, as in the phrase of the Kur<br>\
[v. 96], أَوْ عَدْلُ ذٰلِكَ صِيَامًا [mentioned voce عَدْلٌ];<br>\
and عِدْلٌ and ↓ عَدِيلٌ, in relation to what is perceived by the sense, as things weighed and things<br>\
numbered and things measured: Ibn-&#39;Ámir, however, read او عِدْلُ ذلك; and Ks and the people of<br>\
El-Medeeneh, with fet-h [i. e. عَدْلُ]: (TA:) or<br>\
عِدْلُ الشَّىْءِ, with kesr, signifies the like of the<br>\
thing in kind, (Mgh, Msb,) or in quantity, or<br>\
measure, or the like, (Msb,) or also in quantity,<br>\
or measure, or the like, (Mgh,) and IF says, in<br>\
weight; (Msb;) and ↓ عَدْلُهُ, with fet-h, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) its like, (Mgh,) or what will stand in its<br>\
stead, (Msb,) of a thing different in kind, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) whence the phrase of the Kur أَوْ عَدْلُ ذٰلِكَ<br>\
صِيَامًا [mentioned above]; عَدْل being originally<br>\
an inf. n.: (Msb:) Akh says, العِدْلُ, with kesr,<br>\
signifies المِثْلُ; and ↓ العَدْلُ, with fet-h, is originally an inf. n., but is made a subst. to denote<br>\
المِثْلُ in order to distinguish it from the عِدْل of<br>\
goods or commodities [which will be expl. in<br>\
what follows]: Fr says, العِدْلُ, with kesr, is the<br>\
like (المِثْلُ), as in the saying عِنْدِى عِدْلُ غُلَامِكَ<br>\
[I have the like of thy boy or young man] and<br>\
عِدْلُ شَاتِكَ [the like of thy sheep or goat]; but<br>\
you say ↓ العَدْلُ, with nasb [i. e. fet-h] to the ع,<br>\
when you mean the [equal in] value, of what is<br>\
different in kind; though sometimes it is pronounced with kesr by some of the Arabs, app. by<br>\
an error on their part: (S, O:) or some allow<br>\
one&#39;s saying عِنْدِى عِدْلُ غُلَامِكَ as meaning I<br>\
have the like of thy boy or young man, [and app.<br>\
↓ عَدْلُهُ also,] and عَدْلُهُ with fet-h only as meaning<br>\
his value: (TA:) but Zj says that العَدْلُ and<br>\
العِدْلُ both signify the like, whether it be of the<br>\
same kind or of a different kind; and if one<br>\
make a mistake, he should not say that some of<br>\
the Arabs have erred: (O:) the pl. (S, O, K)<br>\
of عِدْلٌ, by common consent, (S, O,) is أَعْدَالٌ,<br>\
(S, O, K,) and [that of ↓ عَدِيلٌ is] عُدَلَآءُ. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also The half of a load, (K, TA,) such as<br>\
is on either of the two sides of the camel; (TA;)<br>\
or a burden [borne on one side of a beast, counterbalancing another on the other side, or] made<br>\
equiponderant to another burden: (Az, TA:) pl.<br>\
[of pauc.] أَعْدَالٌ and [of mult.] عُدُولٌ: (Sb, K:)<br>\
and ↓ عَدِيلٌ signifies the equal of a person in<br>\
weight and measure or size or the like (S, K, * TA)<br>\
in the [vehicle called] مَحْمِل: (TA:) Sb says<br>\
that it signifies a human being that is the equal of<br>\
another [in weight]; distinguishing it from عِدْلٌ,<br>\
which, he says, is applied only to goods, or commodities: (IB, TA:) [but] ↓ عَدِيلَتَانِ signifies<br>\
two sacks (غِرَارَتَانِ); because each counter balances,<br>\
or is equiponderant to, the other. (TA.) Hence<br>\
one says of the عُدُول of an evil judicial decision,<br>\
مَا هُمْ عُدُولٌ وَلٰكِنْ عُدُولٌ [meaning They are not<br>\
witnesses whose testimony is approvable, but equalized loads of merchandise]. (TA.) And [hence<br>\
also] one says, وَقَعَ المُصْطَرِعَانِ عِدْلَىْ بَعِيرٍ, meaning The two [men wrestling] fell together, neither<br>\
of them having thrown down the other. (TA.<br>\
[See also عِكْمٌ.])<br>\
عَدَلٌ The equalizing of the [two burdens, or half-loads, called] عِدْلَانِ. (IAar, O, K.)<br>\
عَدَلَةٌ: see what next follows, in two places.<br>\
عُدَلَةٌ Men who pronounce witnesses to be veracious, and good, or righteous; (AZ, IAar, O, K, *<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ عَدَلَةٌ; (K;) and the former is<br>\
also applied to a man who does so: (AZ, O,<br>\
TA: *) or the former is applied to a single per-<br>\
son, and ↓ عَدَلَةٌ is applied to a pl. number. (AA,<br>\
K, TA.)<br>\
عَدِيلٌ: see عِدْلٌ, in four places.<br>\
عَدَالَةٌ: see عَدْلٌ, in two places. It is an inf. n.<br>\
of عَدُلَ (S, O, Msb) said of a witness; like ↓ عُدُولَةٌ:<br>\
and signifies The quality of a witness such as is<br>\
termed عَدْلٌ [q. v.]: it is expl. as being a quality<br>\
the regard of which necessitates the guarding<br>\
against what falls short of the requirements of<br>\
manly virtue or moral goodness, habitually and<br>\
evidently; which evident falling short thereof is<br>\
not effected by small instances of lapses or falls<br>\
into wrongdoing, and by perversion of speech,<br>\
because mistake and forgetfulness are supposable<br>\
[as the causes thereof], and interpretation not<br>\
according to the obvious meaning; but it is when<br>\
such is the known and repeated practice of the<br>\
person: regard is to be had to the goodness, or<br>\
honesty, of every individual, and his usual practice<br>\
in respect of his apparel, and his dealing in selling<br>\
and buying, and the conveyance of goods, and<br>\
other things; and when he does that which is not<br>\
suitable to him, without necessity, his testimony is<br>\
impugned; otherwise it is not. (Msb.)<br>\
عُدُولَةٌ: see عَدْلٌ, first sentence: and عَدَالَةٌ.<br>\
عَدِيلَتَانِ: see عِدْلٌ, last quarter.<br>\
عَدَوْلَى An old, tall tree: (K:) or ↓ شَجَرٌ عَدَوْلِىٌّ<br>\
signifies old trees; one of which is termed عَدَوْلِيَّةٌ:<br>\
or, accord. to AHn, ↓ عَدَوْلِىٌّ signifies anything<br>\
old. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also the next following paragraph.<br>\
عَدَوْلِىٌّ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also, thus correctly, as in the S,<br>\
(TA, [and thus, app., accord. to the K, though<br>\
this is thought by SM, and not altogether without reason, to require by its context the reading<br>\
of ↓ عَدَوْلَى, as does, app., the O,]) A seaman,<br>\
or mariner. (S, O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And pl. [app.<br>\
a mistake for n. un.] of عَدَوْلِيَّةٌ, (K,) which latter<br>\
means Certain ships or boats, (O, K, TA,) or a<br>\
[sort of] ship or boat, (S,) or it is an epithet<br>\
applied to certain ships or boats, (EM p. 58,) so<br>\
called as being of عَدَوْلَى, (S, O, * K, TA,) meaning a city of El-Bahreyn, (S, O, * TA,) not meaning, as would be imagined from the context in the<br>\
K, the tree [said to be] thus called; (TA;) mentioned in the poetry of Tarafeh, (S, O, TA,) in<br>\
the fourth verse of his Mo&#39;allakah, (O, TA,) and<br>\
thus expl. by As: (TA:) or meaning old; or<br>\
large: (O, TA:) or so called as being of a place<br>\
named عَدَوْلَاة, of the measure فَعَوْلَاة: (TA:) or<br>\
of عَدَوْل, a man who used to construct ships or<br>\
boats: or of a people who used to alight and<br>\
abide in Hejer. (O, K.)<br>\
عَادِلٌ: see عَدْلٌ, latter half, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also An attributer of a copartner, or of copartners, to God. (S, TA.) A woman is related<br>\
to have said to El-Hajjáj, يَا قَاسِطُ يَا عَادِلُ; [by<br>\
which she meant O deviater from the right course;<br>\
O attributer of a copartner, or of copartners, to<br>\
God;] (S, * O;) whereupon, the people thinking<br>\
that she was commending him, he said that by<br>\
her saying يا قاسط, she referred to the words of<br>\
the Kur [lxxii. 15] أَمَّا الْقَاسِطُونَ فَكَانُوا لِجَهَنَّمَ<br>\
حَطَبًا [expl. voce قَاسِطٌ; and by her saying يا<br>\
عادل, to the words in the same [vi. 151] وَهُمْ<br>\
بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ [expl. above, see 1]. (O.)<br>\
مَعْدِلٌ A place of turning away or back; as<br>\
also ↓ مَعْدُولٌ: so in the saying, مَا لَهُ مَعْدِلٌ and<br>\
↓ مَعْدُولٌ [There is for him no place of turning<br>\
away or back]: (K:) pl. مَعَادِلُ: Aboo-Khirásh<br>\
says,<br>\
تَضِيقُ عَلَىَّ الأَرْضُ ذَاتُ المَعَادِلِ<br>\
meaning [The earth having those ways in which<br>\
one may turn in various directions becomes strait<br>\
to me; or] having such amplitude that by reason<br>\
thereof one may turn in it to the right and left.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A way, course, mode, or manner,<br>\
of acting or conduct or the like: thus in the saying<br>\
أَخَذَ فِى مَعْدِلِ الحَقِّ [He took to the right way of<br>\
acting], and مَعْدِلِ البَاطِلِ [the false, or wrong,<br>\
way of acting]: and in like manner one says,<br>\
اُنْظُرُوا إِلَى سُوْءِ مَعَادِلِهِ Look ye at his evil ways of<br>\
acting: and هُوَ سَدِيدُ المَعَادِلِ [He is one who<br>\
takes a right direction in respect of the ways of<br>\
acting]. (TA.)<br>\
مَعْدَلَةٌ: see عَدْلٌ, former half, in seven places.<br>\
مُعَدَّلٌ Anything straightened, or made even:<br>\
(S, O, K:) [&amp;c.: see its verb.] ―<br>\
-b2-  الكُرُّ المُعَدَّلُ<br>\
see in art. كر.<br>\
مُعَدَّلَاتٌ The angles, or corners, of a house or<br>\
chamber. (IAar, O, K.)<br>\
مَعْدُولٌ: see مَعْدِلٌ, in two places.<br>\
مُعْتَدِل [Right, or having a right direction;<br>\
straight, or even; equal; equable, or uniform;<br>\
symmetrical, proportionate; suitable in itself or<br>\
in its parts: see its verb]. مُعْتَدِلَةٌ applied to a<br>\
she-camel means Whose limbs, or members, are<br>\
rendered even, one with another, (Lth, Az, TA,)<br>\
including her hump and other parts; as is the<br>\
case when she becomes fat: erroneously said by<br>\
Sh, on the authority of Mohárib, to be مُعَنْدَلَة,<br>\
belonging to art. عندل. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Of a<br>\
middling sort, in quantity, or quality; as a body<br>\
between tallness and shortness, and water between the hot and the cold; and [moderate, or<br>\
temperate,] as a day of which the air is pleasant;<br>\
contr. of مُعْتَذِلٌ, with the pointed ذ. (TA.)<br>\
فَرَسٌ مُعْتَدِلُ الفرقِ [app. الفَرْقِ] means A horse<br>\
whose غُرَّة [or blaze] occupies the middle of his<br>\
forehead, not reaching to one of the eyes nor<br>\
inclining upon one of the cheeks. (AO, TA.)<br>\
أَيَّامٌ مُعْتَدِلَاتٌ signifies [Days moderate in temperature; or] pleasant, not hot, days. (TA.) And<br>\
المُعْتَدِلَاتُ is applied to Forty nights of varying,<br>\
or alternating, heat and cold, commencing from<br>\
the [auroral] rising of Suheyl [or Canopus,<br>\
which, in Central Arabia, at the commencement<br>\
of the era of the Flight, was about the 4th of<br>\
August, O. S.]: (AZ, TA in art. صفر: see<br>\
صَفَرِىٌّ:) or the days of heat known by the appel-lation of وَقَدَاتُ سُهَيْلٍ [the most vehement heats of<br>\
Canopus]; as also المُعْتَذِلَاتُ [q. v.]. (El-<br>\
