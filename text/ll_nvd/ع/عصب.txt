عَصَبَ, aor.<br>\
عَصِبَ, (K,) inf. n. عَصْبٌ, (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, O, K,) He twisted [a thing], or wound [it]<br>\
round: (A, K, TA:) this is the primary signification: (TA:) and he folded [it]; (A, K;) or<br>\
he folded [it] tightly: (S, O, TA:) and he bound<br>\
[it], or tied [it]: (A, Mgh, K, TA:) عَصْبٌ denotes the binding, or tying, a thing with another<br>\
thing, lengthwise, or [more commonly] around.<br>\
(O.) See also 2, first sentence. [And see<br>\
مَعْصُوبٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  He twisted, or spun, thread. (K, *<br>\
TA.) And He put together thread, and bound<br>\
it, previously to dyeing it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عَصَبَ<br>\
الكَبْشَ, (S, O, Msb, K, *] aor. as above, (K,) and<br>\
so the inf. n., (S, Msb, K,) He bound, or tied,<br>\
(tightly, TA) the testicles of the ram, in order<br>\
that they might fall, without his extracting them:<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K:) and in like manner one says of<br>\
a goat, (K,) and of other beasts. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عَصَبَ<br>\
النَّاقَةَ, (O, Msb, K, *) aor. as above, (K,) and so<br>\
the inf. n., (Msb, K, TA,) and عِصَابٌ also;<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ اعتصبها; (O, K;) He bound the<br>\
thighs of the she-camel, (Msb, K, TA,) or the<br>\
lower parts of her nostrils, (TA,) with a cord,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) in order that she might yield her<br>\
milk copiously: (Msb, K, TA:) and (O) عَصَبَ<br>\
فَخِذَ النَّاقَةِ [He bound the thigh of the she-camel]<br>\
for that purpose. (S, O.) [See عَصُوبٌ.] Hence<br>\
one says, أَعْطَى عَلَى العَصْبِ (tropical:)  He gave by means<br>\
of force. (TA.) And مِثْلِى لَا يَدِرُّ بِالعِصَابِ (assumed tropical:)  Such<br>\
a one as I am will not give by means of force. (A,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  عَصَبَتْ فَرْجَهَا She (a woman) bound her<br>\
vulva with a bandage. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b6-  عَصَبَ الشَّجَرَةَ,<br>\
(S, O, K,) aor.<br>\
عَصِبَ, inf. n. عَصْبٌ, (K,) He drew<br>\
together the branches of the tree (S, O, K, TA)<br>\
that were straggling, (K, TA,) by means of a<br>\
rope, (TA,) and then beat it, (S, O, K, TA,) in<br>\
order that its leaves might fall. (S, O, TA.)<br>\
[Golius assigns this signification also to عَصَّبَ,<br>\
as on the authority of the S, in which I do not<br>\
find it.] El-Hajjáj said, (S, TA,) when preaching to the people at El-Koofeh, (TA,) لَأَعْصِبَنَّكُمْ<br>\
عَصْبَ السَّلَمِ (S) or السَّلَمَةِ (TA) [I will assuredly<br>\
draw you together and beat you as one does the<br>\
selem or the selemeh]. The سَلَمَة is a tree of the<br>\
kind called عِضَاه, having thorns, and its leaves<br>\
are the قَرَظ with which hides are tanned: [but<br>\
see قَرَظٌ:] the removal of the leaves with the<br>\
hand being difficult on account of the many<br>\
thorns, its branches are drawn together and<br>\
bound tightly with a rope; then the beater pulls<br>\
them towards him, and beats them with his staff;<br>\
whereupon the leaves become scattered for the<br>\
cattle and for him who desires to gather them.<br>\
(TA.) Or this is done, (S, O, TA,) accord. to<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd, (S, O,) only (TA) when they desire<br>\
to cut down the selemeh, that they may get at<br>\
the stock. (S, O, TA.) [Hence,] one says,<br>\
فُلَانٌ لَا تُعْصَبُ سَلَمَاتُهُ [Such a one will not have<br>\
his selemehs bound round with a rope, and beaten]:<br>\
a prov., applied to a strong, mighty man, not to<br>\
be subdued nor abased. (A, * TA.) And one<br>\
says also of winds, تَعْصِبُ الشَّجَرَ عِنْدَ دُرُوجِهَا فِيهِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [They compress the branches of the trees, as<br>\
though they bound them round, in their passage<br>\
among them]: and such winds are termed<br>\
↓ عَصَائِبُ. (O.) And عَصَبَ القَوْمَ, aor.<br>\
عَصِبَ, inf. n.<br>\
عَصْبٌ, (assumed tropical:)  It (an affair, or event,) drew the people<br>\
together, and became severe to them. (Az, TA.)<br>\

smith) repaired the crack of the glass vessel by<br>\

-b8-<br>\
عَصَبَ بِرَأْسِ قَوْمِهِ العَارَ (assumed tropical:)  He made disgrace to<br>\
befall his people [as though he bound it upon the<br>\
head of their chief or upon the head of each of them].<br>\
(O.) It is related in a trad. respecting the battle<br>\
of Bedr, that &#39;Otbeh the son of Rabee&#39;ah said,<br>\
اِرْجِعُوا وَلَا تُقَاتِلُوا وَاعْصِبُوهَا بِرَأْسِى (assumed tropical:)  [Return ye,<br>\
and fight not; and bind it upon my head];<br>\
meaning attach and attribute to me the disgrace<br>\
that will befall you for relinquishing the battle<br>\
and inclining to peace. (IAth, TA.) And it is<br>\
said in another trad., قُومُوا بِمَا عَصَبَكُمْ بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  Fulfil<br>\
ye the obligations with which He (meaning God)<br>\
has bound you; or which He has imposed upon<br>\
you and attached to you; by his commands and<br>\
prohibitions. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  عَصَبَ الشَّىْءَ and عَلَى<br>\
الشَّىْءِ, aor.<br>\
عَصِبَ, inf. n. عَصْبٌ and عِصَابٌ, He<br>\
grasped the thing with his hand. (K, * TA.) A<br>\
poet, cited by IAar, says,<br>\
وَكُنَّا يَا قُرَيْشُ إِذَا عَصَبْنَا<br>\
يَجِىْءُ عِصَابُنَا بِدَمٍ عَبِيطِ<br>\
[And we were, O Kureysh, when we grasped our<br>\
opponents, such that our grasping brought fresh<br>\
blood]; عِصَابُنَا meaning our grasping those whom<br>\
we opposed with the swords. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  And<br>\
عَصَبَ, aor.<br>\
عَصِبَ, inf. n. عَصْبٌ, He clung, or kept, to<br>\
a thing. (K.) One says, عَصَبَ المَآءَ He kept to,<br>\
or by, the water. (IAar, TA.) And عَصَبَ الرَّجُلُ<br>\
بَيْتَهُ The man remained, or stayed, in his house,<br>\
or tent, not quitting it. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  And He<br>\
went round, encompassed, or surrounded, a thing.<br>\
(K.) It is said in a trad., of the angel Gabriel,<br>\
on the day of Bedr, قَدْ عَصَبَ رَأْسَهُ الغُبَارُ The dust<br>\
had overspread, [or surrounded,] and clung to,<br>\
his head: or, as some relate it, قَدْ عَصَمَ ثَنِيَّتَيْهِ<br>\
الغُبَارُ; and if this be not a mistake, the latter<br>\
verb is syn. with the former: ب and م being<br>\
often interchangeable: (L, TA:) the latter phrase<br>\
means, as also with عَصَبَ, the dust had stuck to<br>\
his two central incisors. (TA in art. عصم.)<br>\
And Ibn Ahmar says,<br>\
إِذْ عَصَبَ النَّاسَ شَمَالٌ وَقُرٌ<br>\
[وَقُرْ being for وَقُرٌّ] i. e. When north wind and<br>\
cold environ me. (L, TA.) And one says also,<br>\
عَصَبَ الغُبَارُ بِالجَبَلِ The dust encompassed, or surrounded, the mountain. (L, TA.) And عَصَبُوا بِهِ<br>\
They encompassed, or surrounded, him: (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, O, TA:) and they encompassed, or surrounded, him, looking at him: (S, O:) and,<br>\
(Msb, K,) as also عَصِبُوا, (K,) aor. of the<br>\
former<br>\
عَصِبَ, (Msb, K,) and inf. n. عَصْبٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
and aor. of the latter<br>\
عَصَبَ, (K,) they assembled<br>\
around him (Msb, K) for fight or defence. (Msb.<br>\
For another explanation of عَصَبَ and عَصِبَ,<br>\
see 12.) And عَصَبَ القَوْمُ بِالنَّسَبِ i. q. أَحَاطُوا بِهِ<br>\
[app. meaning The people, or party, included, or<br>\
comprehended, the relations, or kinsmen; for<br>\
النَّسَبُ is often used for ذَوُو النَّسَبِ]. (Msb.) And<br>\
عَصَبَتِ الإِبِلُ بِالمَآءِ The camels surrounded, or encircled, the water. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b12-  عَصَبَ الرِّيقُ بِفِيهِ,<br>\
(S, O, K, * TA,) aor.<br>\
عَصِبَ, inf. n. عَصْبٌ; (K, TA;)<br>\
and عَصِبَ, aor.<br>\
عَصَبَ; (TA;) The saliva became<br>\
dry in his mouth. (S, O, K, * TA.) And عَصَبَ<br>\
الرِّيقُ فَاهُ (S, O, TA) The saliva by its drying<br>\
made his mouth dry: and the saliva adhered to<br>\
his mouth. (TA.) Aboo-Mohammad El-Fak&#39;asee<br>\
says,<br>\
يَعْصِبُ فَاهُ الرِّيقُ أَىَّ عَصْبِ<br>\
عَصْبَ الجُبَابِ بِشَفَاهِ الوَطْبِ<br>\
[The saliva makes his mouth dry, with what a<br>\
drying ! as the drying of the spume of camels&#39;<br>\
milk on the lips of the skin]. (S, O.) And<br>\
عَصَبَ فُوهُ, aor.<br>\
عَصِبَ, inf. n. عَصْبٌ, His mouth, with<br>\
his saliva, became dry. (O.) And عَصَبَ الفَمُ,<br>\
(K, * TA,) aor.<br>\
عَصِبَ, inf. n. عَصْبٌ and عُصُوبٌ,<br>\
meaning [The mouth, or teeth, (the latter accord.<br>\
to the explanation in the K,)] became foul, or<br>\
dirty, from dust and the like, (K, TA,) as from<br>\
vehement thirst, or fear. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b13-  عَصَبَ, aor.<br>\
عَصِبَ,<br>\
inf. n. عُصُوبٌ, He was, or became, [hungry; or]<br>\
very hungry; or his bowels were almost dried up<br>\
with hunger: because it is said of the practice<br>\
of a hungry man&#39;s binding round his belly, as<br>\
expl. voce مَعْصُوبٌ [q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b14-  عَصَبَ الأُفُقُ<br>\
The horizon became red. (S, O. [In Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Lex. عَصِبَ, as from the K, in which I do not<br>\
find it. See عَصْبٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  عَصِبَ, (S, O, K,) with<br>\
kesr, (S, O,) like فَرِحَ, (K,) said of flesh, or<br>\
flesh-meat, It had many عَصَبَ [i. e. sinews, or<br>\
tendons]. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَصِبَ, aor.<br>\
عَصَبَ, inf. n.<br>\
عَصْبٌ, [so in the TA, and so in a verse there<br>\
cited, not عَصَبٌ,] He was, or became, firm and<br>\
compact in flesh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Other meanings of<br>\
this verb have been mentioned above.]<br>\
2<br>\
عصّب, (S, A, O, &amp;c.,) inf. n. تَعْصِيبٌ, (S,<br>\
A, O,) [He bound, or wound round, a thing with<br>\
several circumvolutions:] he bound [or wound<br>\
round] a man&#39;s head with a turban, fillet, bandage,<br>\
or the like; (S, * O, * Msb, K, * TA;) as also<br>\
↓ عَصَبَ, inf. n. عَصْبٌ: (MA:) and he bound a<br>\
broken limb, or a wound, with a piece of rag or<br>\
a bandage. (L, TA.) He turbaned a man; attired<br>\
him with a turban. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (A, O,)<br>\
تَعْصِيبٌ signifies (tropical:)  [The crowning a man: (see the<br>\
pass. part. n.:)] the making a man a chief: (A,<br>\
O, K, TA:) for turbans are the crowns of the<br>\
Arabs: (O:) when a man&#39;s people made him a<br>\
chief, they bound his head with a turban: (A,<br>\
TA:) as kings wore crowns, so the chiefs of the<br>\
Arabs wore red turbans: (L, TA:) there were<br>\
brought to the desert, from Haráh (هَرَاة), red<br>\
turbans, which the nobles among the Arabs wore.<br>\
(Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] عصّبهُ بِالسَّيْفِ i. q.<br>\
عَمَّمَهُ بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He cut, or wounded, him in the place<br>\
of the turban, with the sword]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And عصّبهُ, inf. n. as above, He, or it, [caused<br>\
him to bind his waist by reason of hunger: (see<br>\
the pass. part. n.:) and hence,] made him to<br>\
hunger: (K:) and عَصَّبَتْهُمُ السِّنُونَ The years of<br>\
drought, or sterility, made them to hunger:<br>\
(TA:) or عصّبتهُ السِّنُونَ The years of drought,<br>\
or sterility, ate up his property, or cattle.<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S, O.) And It [i. e. drought or the<br>\
like] destroyed him: (K:) and عصّب الدَّهْرُ مَالَهُ<br>\
Adverse fortune destroyed his cattle, or camels &amp;c.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And He called him مُعَصَّب [meaning<br>\
poor]: so says IAar; and he cites as an ex.,<br>\
يُدْعَى المُعَصَّبَ مَنْ قَلَّتْ حَلُوبَتُهُ<br>\
وَهَلْ يُعَصَّبُ مَاضِى الهَمِّ مِقْدَامُ<br>\
[He is called the poor, whose milch-cattle have<br>\
become few: but should one whose purpose is effectual, one of great boldness, be called poor?].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  الذَّكَرُ يُعَصِّبُ الأُنْثَى means The male<br>\
makes the female to be such as is termed عَصَبَةٌ [by<br>\
his being consociated with her as such]. (Mgh.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَعْصَبَ see 12. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Golius explains this v. as meaning “ Firmiter religavit: ” or, as a trans. v.<br>\
governing an accus., “constringi jussit: ” as on<br>\
the authority of the S, in which I do not find it<br>\
in any sense.]<br>\
5<br>\
تعصّب i. q. شَدَّ العِصَابَةَ [i. e. He bound the<br>\
turban, or fillet, round his (own) head; a meaning well known, whence that explained in the<br>\
next sentence: (see also 8:) and he bound a<br>\
bandage of some kind round his (own) body, by<br>\
reason of hunger: see مُعَصَّبٌ]. (S, O, Msb, * K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  He was made a chief; quasi-pass.<br>\
of 2 [q. v.]. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And it has also another<br>\
signification, from العَصَبِيَّة; (S, O;) [i. e.] it signifies also أَتَى بِالعَصَبِيَّةِ; (K, TA;) which means<br>\
[He aided his people, or party, against hostile<br>\
conduct: or he was angry, or zealous, for the sake<br>\
of his party, and defended them: (see عَصَبِىٌّ and<br>\
عَصَبِيَّةٌ:) or] he invited, or summoned, others to the<br>\
aid of his party, and to combine, or league, with<br>\
them against those who acted towards them with<br>\
hostility, whether they were wrongdoers or wronged.<br>\
(TA.) And you say, تَعَصَّبُوا عَلَيْهِمْ They leagued,<br>\
or collected themselves, together against them: and<br>\
تَعَصَّبْنَا لَهُ, and مَعَهُ, We [leagued together for him,<br>\
and with him, and] defended him. (TA.) [See<br>\
also De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Ar., see. ed., i. 445-6;<br>\
where it is shown that التَّعَصُّبُ in religion means<br>\
The being zealous, or a zealot: and see Har pp.<br>\
423 and 573.] ―<br>\

بِهِ. (K.)<br>\

to be indicated by the context (both before and<br>\
after) in the S, It was, or became, hard, firm, or<br>\
strong]. (S, O, K.)<br>\
8<br>\

such companies. (M, L, TA.) [See also 12.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
اعتصب بِهِ: see 5, last sentence.<br>\
12<br>\
اِعْصَوْصَبَ القَوْمُ The people, or party, collected themselves together: (TA:) or did so, and<br>\
became companies such as are called عَصَائِب, (S,<br>\
O, TA,) and became one of such companies: [see<br>\
also 8; and see عُصْبَةٌ:] and in like manner, [did<br>\
so, and] strove, or exerted themselves, in journeying, or pace. (TA.) And اعصوصبت الإِبِلُ The<br>\
camels strove, or exerted themselves, in journeying,<br>\
or pace; as also ↓ اعصبت: and collected themselves together; (K;) [and] so ↓ عَصَبَت and<br>\
↓ عَصِبَت: (Fr, S, O:) or collected themselves together so as to become one عِصَابَة, and strove, or<br>\
exerted themselves, in journeying, or pace. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  اعصوصب is also said of a day, [app. in relation to heat,] meaning It was, or became, vehement, or severe: (S, O:) and of evil, meaning<br>\

-b3-  Also A particular sort of the garments called بُرُود, (S, A, Mgh, O, K,) of the fabric<br>\
of El-Yemen; (S, Mgh, O;) a بُرْد of which the<br>\
yarn is dyed, and then woven; (Msb;) or of<br>\
which the yarn is put together and bound, then<br>\
dyed, and then woven; (A, Mgh, TA; *) not of<br>\
the sort called بُرُودُ الرَّقْمِ: (TA:) it has no pl.,<br>\
(Nh, Msb, TA,) nor dual: (Msb:) you say<br>\
بُرْدُ عَصْبٍ (Nh, Mgh, TA) and بُرُودُ عَصْبٍ (Nh,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, TA) and يُرْدَا عَصْبٍ, (Msb,) and also<br>\
يُرْدٌ عَصْبٌ and بُرُودٌ عَصْبٌ, (Nh, TA,) and ثَوْبٌ,<br>\
عَصْبٌ, (Msb,) and أَرْدِيَةُ العَصْبِ; (A, TA;) and<br>\
sometimes they say عَصْبٌ alone, the بُرْد being<br>\
known by this name: (TA:) or garments of the<br>\
kind called بُرُود, of the fabric of El-Yemen, the<br>\
yarn of which is put together and bound, and then<br>\
dyed, and woven, so that they become partycoloured, because what has been bound thereof remains white, the dye not having taken it; and<br>\
such garments a woman in the period termed عِدَّة<br>\
[q. v.] is allowed to wear, but not garments that<br>\
are [wholly] dyed: or striped garments of the<br>\
kind called بُرُود: and what is forbidden in that<br>\
case is a garment that has been dyed after it<br>\
has been woven; or what are forbidden are the<br>\
عَصْب of El-Yemen, which are said to have been<br>\
dyed with urine; so in the L &amp;c.: (TA:) or,<br>\
accord. to Sub, garments of the kind called بُرُود<br>\
of the fabric of El-Yemen; so called because<br>\
they are dyed with عَصْب, which grows only in<br>\
El-Yemen; [he says that العَصْبُ is a certain dyed<br>\
that does not grow but in El-Yemen; (Msb;)]<br>\
but in this he opposes the generality of authorities;<br>\
for they agree in stating that the garments in<br>\
question are thus called from العَصْبُ, “the act of<br>\
binding,” because the yarn is bound in order that<br>\
the dye may not pervade the whole of the بُرْد.<br>\
(MF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Hence, (assumed tropical:)  Clouds like such as are<br>\
termed لَطْخ [q. v.]: (S, O:) or red clouds or<br>\
mist (K, TA) seen in the western horizon (TA) in<br>\
a time of drought, or sterility; as also ↓ عِصَابَةٌ,<br>\
(K, TA,) pl. عَصَائِبُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  In a trad., mention occurs of a necklace made of عَصْب: ElKhattábee says, if it do not mean the garments<br>\
of El-Yemen, I know not what it is; yet I see<br>\
not how a necklace can be made of these: Aboo-Moosà thinks it may be عَصَب, meaning the tendons of joints, as they may have taken the tendons<br>\
of certain clean animals, and cut them in pieces, and<br>\
made them like beads, and, when dry, made neck<br>\
laces of them; but he adds his having been told<br>\
by some of the people of El-Yemen that عَصْبٌ is<br>\
the name of A certain beast of the sea, or of the<br>\
great river, called also فَرَسُ فِرْعَوْنَ [i. e. Pharaoh&#39;s<br>\
horse, perhaps meaning the hippopotamus], of<br>\
which [meaning of the teeth or bones of which]<br>\
beads and other things, as the handles of knives<br>\
&amp;c., are made, and which is white. (L, TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
And Saliva that sticks and dries in the mouth:<br>\
whence the saying, لَفَظَ فُلَانٌ عَصْبَهُ, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Such a one died. (T and TA in art. لفظ.)<br>\
-A4-<br>\
And A light, or an active, and sharp-headed,<br>\
boy, or young man; (IAar, TA;) [and] so<br>\
عَضْبٌ. (IAar, TA in art. عضب.)<br>\
عُصْبٌ and ↓ عَصْبٌ and ↓ عَصَبٌ (K, TA) Certain trees that twine round other trees, having<br>\
weak leaves; (TA;) the kind of tree called لَبْلَاب<br>\
[dolichos lablab of Linn.]; (K;) said by Sh to<br>\
be a kind of plant that twines round trees, i. q.<br>\
لَبْلَابٌ: [coll. gen. ns.:] the ns. un. are عُصْبَةٌ and<br>\
عَصْبَةٌ and عَصَبَةٌ: (TA:) accord. to Abu-lJarráh, (O, TA,) عَصْبَةٌ signifies a certain thing<br>\
[app. meaning plant] that twines about a قَنَادَة<br>\
[or tragacanth], (O, K, TA,) thus, correctly, in<br>\
many copies of the K, but in some فَتَاة, and in<br>\
some قَنَاة, both of which are wrong, though some<br>\
assert the latter to be correct, (TA,) not to be<br>\
pulled off from it but with an effort: (O, K,<br>\
TA:) [see عِطْفَةٌ:] one says of a man strong in<br>\
struggling for the mastery, قَتَادَةٌ لُوِيَتْ بِعُصْبَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [A<br>\
tragacanth twined about by a lebláb; the strong<br>\
man being app. likened to a tragacanth, and his<br>\
antagonist to a lebláb]: (TA:) and in a trad. of<br>\
Ez-Zubeyr Ibn-El-&#39;Owwám, he is related to have<br>\
said,<br>\
عَلِقْتُهُمْ إِنِّى خُلِقْتُ عُصْبَهْ<br>\
قَتَادَةً تَعَلَّقَتْ بِنُشْبَهْ<br>\
(O, TA:) he puts عصبه for علقه, [evidently, I<br>\
think, a mistranscription for عَلِقًا, (see نُشْبَةٌ, in<br>\
its proper art., for a confirmation,)] the meaning<br>\
being خلقت علقة لخصومى [in which for علقة I<br>\
read عَلِقًا]; then he likens himself to a tragacanth<br>\
in respect of his excessive tenaciousness; for<br>\
بنشبه means “ by the help of a thing of great<br>\
tenaciousness: ” [or نشبه may be here an inf. n.,<br>\
i. e. of نَشِبَ: the meaning of the verse may therefore be, I clung to them: verily I have been<br>\
created a grasper, and a tragacanth that has<br>\
clung by means of a strong holdfast, or that has<br>\
clung with great tenaciousness:] (TA:) Sh explains عُصْبَة (O, TA) with damm on the authority<br>\
of Ed-Deenawaree [i. e. AHn], and عَصْبَة with<br>\
fet-h on the authority of AA, (O,) as meaning<br>\
a certain plant that twines about a tree, and is<br>\
called لَبْلَاب; and نُشْبَة as meaning a man who,<br>\
when he sports with a thing (عَبِثَ بِشَىْءٍ [but<br>\
probably the right reading is شَبِثَ بشىء or تَشَبَّثَ<br>\
i. e. clings to a thing]), hardly, or never, quits<br>\
it. (O, TA.)<br>\
عَصَبٌ [The sinews, or tendons; though the following explanation seems rather to denote the<br>\

-b2-  Also A man&#39;s people, or party, who<br>\

the leading lexicologists: (Msb:) or, as is said<br>\
by Az, a man&#39;s heirs consisting of male relations:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) or his sons, and relations on the<br>\
father&#39;s side: (S:) so called because they encompass him; the father being a طَرَف [i. e. an<br>\
extremity in the right line], and so the son, and<br>\
the paternal uncle being a جَانِب [i. e. a collateral<br>\
relation], and so the brother: (Az, S, TA:) or a<br>\
man&#39;s relations on the father&#39;s side; (Mgh, TA;)<br>\
because they encompass him and he is strengthened by them: (TA:) afterwards it became applied to a single person as well as to a pl. number,<br>\
and both a male and a female: (Mgh:) or the<br>\
lawyers apply it to a single person when there is<br>\
no other than he, because he stands in the place<br>\
of the collective number in receiving the whole of<br>\
the property; and in the language of the law it is<br>\
applied to a female in certain cases relating to<br>\
emancipation and inheritances, but not otherwise<br>\
either in the proper language or in the language<br>\
of the law: (Msb:) and ↓ عُصُوبَةٌ is used as its<br>\
inf. n. [meaning the state of being persons, or<br>\
a person, to whom the term عَصَبَةٌ is applied]:<br>\
(Mgh:) it is said [by Az] in the T, “I have not<br>\
heard any sing. of عَصَبَةٌ: accord. to analogy it<br>\
should be عَاصِبٌ, like as طَالِبٌ is sing. of طَلَبَةٌ: ”<br>\
(TA: [and the like is also said in the Mgh: in<br>\
