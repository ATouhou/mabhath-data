عَمَتَ, aor.<br>\
عَمِتَ, (T, K,) inf. n. عَمْتٌ; (T, S,<br>\
O;) and ↓ عمّت, (O, K,) inf. n. تَعْمِيتٌ; (O;)<br>\
He wound wool (S, O, * K) in an oblong form,<br>\
(TA,) or in a round form, (S, O, K,) like a ring,<br>\
(TA,) for the purpose of its being put in the hand<br>\
and spun (S, O, K) with the spindle: (TA:) or<br>\
he wound soft hair of the camel, and wool, into<br>\
the form of a ring, and spun it, putting it in his<br>\
hand: (T, TA:) the operation termed عَمْتٌ is<br>\
performed after beating, and separating and<br>\
loosening, the wool, and collecting it together, in<br>\
order to wind it upon the hand, and spin it with<br>\
the spindle. (AHeyth, TA.) An ex. of the<br>\
former verb occurs in a verse cited voce رَاجِلَةٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And the former verb signifies also He<br>\
twisted a rope of [the species of trefoil, or clover,<br>\
called] قَتّ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And it is said in the K<br>\
that عَمَتَ فُلَانًا means He overcame, or subdued,<br>\
such a one, and made him to refrain, or restrained<br>\
him; expl. by قَهَرَهُ وَكَفَّهُ: but [SM says that]<br>\
the correct reading is probably وَلَفَّهُ; for in the L<br>\
[and in the O, app. on the authority of Az, to<br>\
whom the same is ascribed in the TA in art. لف]<br>\
we find what here follows: فُلَانٌ يَعْمِتُ أَقْرَانَهُ<br>\
means يَقْهَرُهُمْ وَيَلُفُّهُمْ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Such a one overcomes,<br>\
or subdues, and throws into confusion, his antagonists: and hence, app., what is said in the<br>\
K; the author of which probably found يَكُفَّهُمْ<br>\
erroneously written for يَلُفُّهُمْ in some lexicon, and<br>\
therefore thought it allowable to make عَمَتَ in<br>\
this case to have a sing. for its objective complement]: and it is added that this is said in<br>\
relation to war, and excellence of judgment, and<br>\
knowledge of the case of the enemy, and the subduing him with the infliction of many wounds.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عَمَتَهُ also signifies He beat him with a<br>\
staff, or stick, not caring [for any one]. (K.)<br>\

عَمَّتَ see the first sentence above.<br>\
عَمِيتٌ A twisted rope of [the species of trefoil,<br>\
or clover, called] قَتّ; as also ↓ مَعْمُوتٌ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also what next follows.<br>\
عَمِيتَةٌ A portion of wool, (S, * O, * K,) or of the<br>\
soft hair of the camel, (S, O,) wound in the<br>\
manner described in the first sentence of this art.;<br>\
(S, O, K;) like a سَبِيخَة of cotton, and a سَلِيلَة<br>\
of [goats&#39;] hair, (S, O, TA,) or a فَلِيلَة of [goats&#39;]<br>\
hair: (ISd, TA:) the pl. [of pauc.] is أَعْمِتَةٌ and<br>\
[of mult.] عُمُتٌ [and coll. gen. n., improperly<br>\
called a pl.,] ↓ عَمِيتٌ; (K;) or, accord. to ISd,<br>\
أَعْمِتَةٌ is pl. of عَمِيتٌ, which is pl. of عَمِيتَةٌ;<br>\
(TA;) and عَمَائِتُ is a pl. of this last. (AHeyth,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
عِمِّيتٌ A clever, or an intelligent, watcher, or<br>\
guardian: (S, O, K:) or a knowing, intelligent,<br>\
keeper, or preserver, or guardian: (Az, TA:)<br>\
and a clever, or an intelligent, and a bold, man.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (some say, S, O) Ignorant and<br>\
weak. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (some say, O) Drunken:<br>\
(O, K:) and who cannot go aright, or knows not<br>\
the course, or way, that he would pursue: (K:)<br>\
which last explanation and that which immediately precedes it (i. e. “ drunken ”) appear,<br>\
from the L and other lexicons, to be one signification. (TA.) The pl. is عَمَامِيتُ. (S, O.)<br>\
مَعْمُوتٌ: see عَمِيتٌ.<br>\
