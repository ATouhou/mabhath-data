عَرْقَبَ الدَّابَّةَ He hocked, houghed, hamstrung, or cut the hock-tendon of, the beast. (S,<br>\
A, O, K, *) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَرْقَبَهُ He raised his hocks,<br>\
(namely, a camel&#39;s, O,) in order that he might<br>\
stand up: (O, K:) he assisted him (i. e. a camel)<br>\
to stand up, by raising [his hocks]. (TA.) Thus<br>\
the verb has two contr. meanings. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
عَرْقَبَ (assumed tropical:)  He practised artifice, craft, or cunning.<br>\
(O, K.) One says, إِذَا أَعْيَاكَ غَرِيمُكَ فَعَرْقِبْ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [When thy debtor wearies thee,] practise artifice,<br>\
&amp;c. (AA, O, TA.)<br>\
Q. 2<br>\
تَعَرْقَبَ He mounted a beast from behind.<br>\
(O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  He took his course along the<br>\
narrow roads, or ways, of the mountain, which<br>\
are called عَرَاقِيب. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And تعرقب<br>\
لِخَصْمِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He pursued a way hidden from his adversary: said when one adopts another and<br>\
easier course of speech. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And تعرقب<br>\
عَنِ الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  He turned away, or declined, from<br>\
the affair. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  إِذَا مَطَلَ تَعَقْرَبَ وَإِذَا وَعَدَ<br>\
تَعَرْقَبَ (assumed tropical:)  [When he puts off the fulfilment of his<br>\
promise, he acts like &#39;Akrab (a man notorious for<br>\
putting off the fulfilment of his promises); and<br>\
when he promises, he acts like &#39;Orkoob] (A, TA)<br>\
is a prov. (TA. [See the following paragraph,<br>\
last sentence but one.])<br>\
عُرْقُوبٌ [The tendo Achillis, or heel-tendon;] a<br>\
certain tense, (T, A, Mgh, Msb,) or thick, (K,) or<br>\
thick and tense, (S, O,) tendon, (T, S, A, Mgh,<br>\
O, Msb, K,) behind the two ankle-bones, (T, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) above the heel; (S, O, K;) the thing<br>\
that conjoins the shank and the foot; (As, TA;)<br>\
in a human being: (S, O, K:) pl. عَرَاقِيبُ. (TA,<br>\
&amp;c.) The saying of the Prophet, وَيْلٌ لِلْعَرَاقِيبِ<br>\
مِنَ النَّارِ [Woe to the heel-tendons from the fire of<br>\
Hell] means, to him who neglects the washing of<br>\
them (Mgh, Msb) in the [ablution termed] وُضُوْء.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [In a beast, it is in some instances applied to The hock, or hough; i. e.] the عُرْقُوب of<br>\
a beast is that which, in its hind leg, corresponds<br>\
to the رَكْبَة [or knee] in its fore leg: (S, O, K:)<br>\
[in other instances, it is applied to the tendon of<br>\
the hock, or hough; i. e., to the hamstring; for,<br>\
as] As says, in every quadruped, the عُرْقُوبَانِ are<br>\
in the hind legs, and the رُكْبَتَانِ in the fore legs;<br>\
(S, O, TA;) and the عُرْقُوب of the horse is the<br>\
tendon that conjoins the part wherein meet the<br>\
وَظِيف [here meaning the metatarsus] and the سَاق<br>\
[here meaning the tibia]: (TA: [he says “ of<br>\
the horse,” instead of using a more comprehensive<br>\
term, app. because he is describing that animal:])<br>\
it is, in a quadruped, the tendon that [corresponds<br>\
to that which in a human being] is behind the two<br>\
ankle-bones, between the joint of the foot and the<br>\
shank: in a human being it is a little above the<br>\
heel. (TA, from an explanation of a trad. [This<br>\
last explanation evidently employs terms according<br>\
to their applications in the comparative anatomy<br>\
of quadrupeds and human beings, and therefore<br>\
requires the words which I have supplied. That<br>\
عُرْقُوبٌ, in relation to a beast, signifies the hocktendon is well known: and that it also signifies the<br>\
hock itself is shown by a usage of the verb عَرْقَبَ<br>\
(for it is by raising the hocks that a man assists<br>\
a camel to stand up), and by an explanation voce<br>\
رُكْبَةٌ.]) شَرٌّ مَا أَجَآءَكَ إِلَى مُخَّةِ عُرْقُوبٍ [It is an<br>\
evil thing that has compelled thee to have recourse<br>\
to the marrow of a hock] (K, TA) is a prov.<br>\
(TA) applied to him who seeks to obtain a thing<br>\
from a mean, or sordid, person; (K, TA;) for<br>\
the عرقوب has no marrow. (TA.) And one<br>\
says, فُلَانٌ يَضْرِبُ العَرَاقِيبَ ويَقْرَعُ الظَّنَابِيبَ [Such<br>\
a one smites the hock-tendons of camels to slaughter<br>\
them, and strikes the shins of camels to make them<br>\
lie down that he may mount them in haste];<br>\
meaning that he entertains guests and gives aid,<br>\
or succour. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عُرْقُوبُ الأَسَدِ is a name of<br>\
The Thirteenth Mansion of the Moon. (Kzw:<br>\
see العَوَّآءُ, in art. عو.) ―<br>\
-b4-  طَيْرُ عُرْقُوبٍ is an appellation given to Any bird from which one augurs<br>\
evil to camels, because it wounds them in the hocks<br>\
or hock-tendons (يُعَرْقِبُهَا). (Meyd, TA.) The<br>\
Arabs say that when the bird called أَخْيَل [q. v.]<br>\
lights upon a camel, its hocks, or hock-tendons,<br>\
will assuredly be laid bare: and accord. to the<br>\
[O and] K, طَيْرُ العَرَاقِيبِ is an appellation of The<br>\
[bird called] شِقِرَّاق [which is said in the S &amp;c. to<br>\
be the same as the أَخْيَل]; and [Sgh and SM<br>\
add that] they regard it as of evil omen. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  عُرْقُوبُ القَطَا means The سَاق [or shank] of the<br>\
قطا [or sand-grouse]. (S, O, K.) To this a thing<br>\
is hyperbolically likened to denote its shortness:<br>\
one says يَوْمٌ أَقْصَرُ مِنْ عُرْقُوبِ القَطَا [A day shorter<br>\
than the shank of the katà]: (L, TA:) and a<br>\
poet says, (S, &amp;c.,) namely, El-Find Ez-Zimmánee, (O, L, TA,) or, accord. to Seer, Imra-el-<br>\
Keys Ibn-&#39;Ábis, (IB, L, TA,)<br>\
وَنَبْلِى وَفُقَاهَا كَعَرَاقِيبِ قَطًا طُحْلِ<br>\
[And my arrows, with their notches, like the<br>\
shanks of ash-coloured sand-grouse]. (S, O, L,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  عُرْقُوبٌ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  A turning, or<br>\
bending, part of a valley: (K:) or a part of a valley<br>\
in which is a great turning or bending. (S, O.)<br>\
And A road in a mountain: (K:) or a narrow<br>\
road in a mountain: or a road in a deep valley,<br>\
in which only one can walk. (TA.) And [the<br>\
pl.] عَرَاقِيبُ, (tropical:)  The prominences, or projecting<br>\
parts, of mountains: (O, K, TA:) and the most<br>\
distant, or far-extending, roads, or ways, thereof:<br>\
(Aboo-Kheyreh, O, TA:) for [in travelling mountains,] you follow the most easy way, wherever it<br>\
be: (Aboo-Kheyreh, TA:) or the narrow roads<br>\
or ways, in the hard and elevated parts, of moun-<br>\
tains. (S, O, K.) And [hence, app.,] عَرَاقِيبُ الأُمُورِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Great and difficult affairs: (S, O, K:) as also<br>\
عَرَاقِيلُهَا. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And A mountain always<br>\
crowned with clouds, not rained upon. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
Also (assumed tropical:)  Artifice, craft, or cunning; or a stratagem,<br>\
or trick. (O, K. [See Q. 1, last signification.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b9-  And (assumed tropical:)  Knowledge (عِرْفَان) of an argument, a<br>\
plea, an allegation, or a proof. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
the name of a certain man of the Amalekites,<br>\
(S, O, K, TA,) or, (so says Ibn-El-Kelbee, O,) of<br>\
the Benoo-Abd-Shems-Ibn-Saad, (Jm, O, TA,)<br>\
but this is said to be of no authority, (O,) or of<br>\
El-Ows, (Jm, TA,) the greatest liar of his time,<br>\
(K,) proverbial for breach of promises: (S, O:)<br>\
El-Ashja&#39;ee (whose name was Jubeyhà, O, K)<br>\
says,<br>\
وَعَدْتَ وَكَانَ الخُلْفُ مِنْكَ سَجِيَّةً<br>\
مَوَاعِيدَ عُرْقُوبٍ أَخَاهُ بِيَتْرَبِ<br>\
(S, O, K, TA) i. e. (tropical:)  Thou promisedst, but breach<br>\
of promise was an inherent quality of thee, like the<br>\
promises of &#39;Orkoob to his brother in Yetreb;<br>\
which is in El-Yemámeh; or, as some relate it,<br>\
بِيَثْرِب, i. e. El-Medeeneh, or, as some say, the<br>\
land of the Benoo-Saad; but the former is the<br>\
more correct. (TA. [See also Har p. 160.])<br>\
And one says, هُوَ أَكْذَبُ مِنْ عُرْقُوبِ يَتْرَبَ (tropical:)  [He<br>\
is more mendacious than &#39;Orkoob of Yetreb].<br>\
