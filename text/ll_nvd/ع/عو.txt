عَوَى, aor. يَعْوِى, inf. n. عُوَآءٌ (S, K, TA)<br>\
and عَىٌّ and عَوَّةٌ (K, TA) and عَوْيَةٌ, with fet-h<br>\
and then sukoon, thus in the M, but in the copies<br>\
of the K عَوِيَّةٌ, (TA,) said of a dog, (S, CK, TA,)<br>\
and of a wolf, and of a jackal, (S, TA,) He cried,<br>\
or cried loudly: (S:) [meaning he howled:] he<br>\
twisted his muzzle, then uttered a cry: or he prolonged his cry, not doing so with clearness: and<br>\
↓ اعتوى signifies the same: (K, TA:) [in the<br>\
Ham p. 693, the former is expl. as signifying<br>\
نَبَحَ and صَاحَ; but] it is said that عَوَّةٌ signifies a<br>\
prolonged crying; and is not the same as نَبْحٌ<br>\
[which means “ a barking ”]. (TA.) It is said<br>\
in a prov. لَوْ لَكَ أَعْوِى مَا عَوَيْتُ [If to thee I were<br>\
howling, I had not howled]; (TA;) or لَوْ لَكَ<br>\
عَوَيْتُ لَمْ أَعْوِهْ, in which the ه may be the ه of<br>\
pausation, or it may be put by metonymy for the<br>\
inf. n. so that the meaning is لَمْ أَعْوِ العُوَآءَ:<br>\
(Meyd:) it originated from the fact that a man<br>\
used, [and still uses, as I have had occasion to<br>\
do,] when becoming benighted, in the desert, to<br>\
howl, in order that the dogs, if any person by<br>\
whose presence he might be cheered were near<br>\
him, might hear, and reply to him, and he might<br>\
be guided by their howling: so this man howled,<br>\
and the wolf came to him, whereupon he said<br>\
thus: it relates to the seeker of succour from<br>\
him who will not succour him. (Meyd, * TA.)<br>\
And it is said in a trad., كَأَنِّى أَسْمَعُ عُوَآءَ أَهْلِ<br>\
النَّارِ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [As though I heard] the crying or loud<br>\
crying [or howling] of the people of the fire [of<br>\
Hell]: (TA:) [for] عَوَىَ is used metaphorically<br>\
as meaning he suffered distress, and complained;<br>\
from the عُوَآء of the dog: (Har p. 634:) as IAth<br>\
says, it is more especially used in relation to the<br>\
wolf and the dog. (TA.) And one says of him<br>\
who is esteemed, or found to be, weak, مَا يَعْوِى<br>\
وَمَا يَنْبَحُ (assumed tropical:)  [He does not howl nor does he bark].<br>\
(Ham p. 693.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَوَى إِلَى الفِتْنَةِ means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He called (K, TA) people, or a party, (TA,)<br>\
[to conflict and faction, or the like;] عَوَى being<br>\
used in this sense by way of likening the person<br>\
who does so to a dog, or in contempt of him.<br>\
(Ham p. 693.) [See also 10.] ―<br>\
-b3-  عُوَآءٌ signifies<br>\
also The grumbling cry (رُغَآء) of a weak young<br>\
camel: used in this sense by a poet. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
عُوَآءُ المُغْتَابِ; and the phrase عَوَى عَنِ الرَّجُلِ;<br>\
see in the next paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  عَوَى, (S, K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. عَىٌّ, (S, TA,) He bent a thing; as also<br>\
↓ اعتوى; and likewise a bow; as also ↓ عوّى,<br>\
(K, TA,) inf. n. تَعْوِيَةٌ: (TA:) and (TA) he<br>\
twisted hair, and a rope; (S, TA;) as also ↓ عوّى,<br>\
inf. n. تَعْوِيَةٌ. (S.) One says also عَوَى العِمَامَةَ<br>\
عَيَّةً He twisted the turban with a single twisting.<br>\
(TA.) And عَوَيْتُ رَأْسَ النَّاقَةِ I turned the head<br>\
of the she-camel by means of the nose-rein. (S,<br>\
TA.) And القَوْمُ صُدُورَ رِكَابهِمْ ↓ عوّى and عَوَوْهَا<br>\
The party inclined the breasts of their camels that<br>\
they were riding. (TA.) And عَوَى البُرَةَ He<br>\
bent, or inclined, the nose-ring of the she-camel.<br>\
(K, * TA.) And النَّاقَةُ تَعْوِى بُرَتَهَا فِى سَيْرِهَا The<br>\
she-camel twists her nose-ring with her خِطَام [or<br>\
halter] in her going. (S, TA.) And عَوَاهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ<br>\
He turned him from the thing. (TA.) And one<br>\
says of the man who possesses prudence, or discretion, and precaution, or good judgment, and<br>\
who is hardy, strong, or sturdy, ما ينهى ولا يعوى<br>\
[i. e. مَا يُنْهَى وَلَا يُعْوَى He is not forbidden nor is<br>\
he turned]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَوَى signifies also<br>\
He (a man) attained to the age of thirty years,<br>\
so that his arm, or hand, became strong, and he<br>\
twisted vehemently the arm, or hand, of another.<br>\
(ISd, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
عوّى عَنِ الرَّجُلِ, thus in the M, with tesh-deed in the case of عوى and also in the case of<br>\
كذب in the explanation; but in the K, ↓ عَوَى<br>\
[without teshdeed]; (TA;) (assumed tropical:)  He repelled from the<br>\
man, or defended him; syn. كَذَّبَ, and رَدَّ: (M,<br>\
K, TA:) in the S is said the like of what is said<br>\
in the M; عَوَّيْتُ عَنِ الرَّجُلِ being expl. in the S<br>\
as meaning (assumed tropical:)  I repelled from, or defended, the<br>\
man (كذّبت عنه), and replied against his backbiter or censurer (رَدَدْت عَلَى مُغْتَابِهِ): and in the<br>\
A, this phrase is said to be metaphorical, and<br>\
expl. as meaning (tropical:)  I repelled from the man the<br>\
clamouring [or, as we say, the barking] of the<br>\
backbiter or the censurer (المُغْتَابِ ↓ رَدَدْت عَنْهُ عُوَآءَ):<br>\
thus all these three are express authorities for the<br>\
teshdeed. (TA.) [Freytag has represented the<br>\
phrase in the S as agreeing with the reading<br>\
thereof in the K, and has strangely expl. the verb<br>\
with عن following it as meaning “ Mendacii<br>\
arguit et refellit.”]<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, latter half, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
3<br>\
عاوى الكِلَابَ He cried, or cried loudly,<br>\
[meaning he howled,] to the dogs, they doing so to<br>\
him. (S, TA.) And [hence] عَاوَاهُمْ, (K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. مُعَاوَاةٌ, (TA,) He cried, or cried loudly, to<br>\
them, [i. e. to men,] they doing so to him. (K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تعاوت الكِلَابُ The dogs cried, or cried loudly,<br>\
[meaning howled,] one to another. (TA.) ―<br>\

تَعَاوَوْا عَلَيْهِ, (K, TA,) and تَغَاوَوْا, (TA,) They<br>\
collected themselves together, (K, TA,) or aided<br>\
one another, (TA,) against him. (K, TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انعوى It became bent [or twisted]. (S, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
اعتوى: see 1, first sentence:<br>\
-A2-  and the<br>\
same also in the latter half.<br>\
10<br>\
استعوى كَلْبًا [He incited a dog to cry, or<br>\
cry loudly, or to howl]. (Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, TA in art.<br>\
حمى.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And اِسْتَعْوَاهُمْ He sought, or demanded,<br>\
of them, aid, or succour: (K, TA:) or, accord.<br>\
to the S, it means نَعَقَ بِهِمْ إِلَى الفِتْنَةِ [he urged<br>\
them by clamour, or shouting, to conflict and faction, or the like]: (TA: [in one of my copies of<br>\
the S, for إِذَا نَعَقَ بِهِمْ, the reading followed in the<br>\
JM and PS as well as in the TA, I find اذا<br>\
يُغْوِيهِمْ, which is app. a mistranscription: see<br>\
also عَوَى إِلَى الفِتْنَةِ:]) accord. to Z, it means he<br>\
desired, or demanded, of them, that they should<br>\
cry, or cry loudly, behind him. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اِسْتَعْوَيْتُهُ<br>\
I desired, or demanded, of him, that he should<br>\

عَاعَى, [mentioned in the K in this art.,<br>\
and also, but as unexplained, in art. عيع,] aor.<br>\
يُعَاعِى, inf. n. مُعَاعَاةٌ (K, TA) and عَاعَاةٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and عَوْعَى, [app. the original form,] aor. يُعَوْعِى,<br>\
(K, TA,) inf. n. عَوْعَاةٌ; (TA;) and عَيْعَى, aor.<br>\
يُعَيْعِى, inf. n. عَيْعَاةٌ and عِيعَآءٌ [in some copies of<br>\
the K عَيْعَآء]; He chid sheep by the cry عَا or عَوْ<br>\
or عَاىْ (K, TA) or عَآءٌ. (TA.)<br>\
عَا and عَوْ [in the CK عُو] and عَاىْ (K, TA)<br>\
and عَآءْ (TA) are Cries by which sheep are chidden.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
عَوٌّ: see العَوَّآءُ, last sentence.<br>\
عَوَّةٌ [mentioned in the first sentence of this art.<br>\
as an inf. n.] A crying out, shouting, or clamouring; like ضَوَّةٌ: one says, سَمِعْتُ عَوَّةَ القَوْمِ i. e. [I<br>\
heard] the cries, or shouts, or clamour, of the<br>\
people, or party: so says AZ, and As says the<br>\
like. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also العَوَّآءُ, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also A way-mark that is set up, composed of<br>\
stones: mentioned by IDrd, but incorrectly as<br>\
being with damm. (TA.)<br>\
عُوَّةٌ: see the next paragraph, last sentence.<br>\
العَوَّآءُ (S, K) and العَوَّا (K) The dog (S, K) that<br>\
howls (يَعْوِى) much. (S.) Hence the saying, عَلَيْهِ<br>\
العَفَأءُ وَالكَلْبُ العَوَّآءُ [Upon him be the dust, and the<br>\
howling dog]: a form of imprecation. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And the latter signifies also The wolf. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also, both, (S, K, TA,) but the latter is the more<br>\
common, and its ا is to denote the fem. gender,<br>\
like that of حُبْلَى [in which it is written ى], the<br>\
word being fem., (TA,) (tropical:)  One of the Mansions of<br>\
the Moon, (S, K, TA,) namely, the Thirteenth;<br>\
(Kzw in his Descr. of the Mansions of the Moon;)<br>\
consisting of five stars, (S, K,) said to be the<br>\
haunch of the Lion [of which the Arabs, or some<br>\
of them, extended the figure (as they did also that<br>\
of the Scorpion) far beyond the limits that we<br>\
assign to it: see ذِرَاعٌ]: (S:) or four stars [g, d,<br>\
e and h, of Virgo], (K, and Kzw ubi suprà,)<br>\
behind الصَّرْفَة [q. v.], (Kzw ibid.,) resembling an<br>\
alif (K, Kzw) with the lower part turned back,<br>\
in the Koofee handwriting [in which it is nearly<br>\
like the Roman L (see زَاوِيَةٌ, in art. زوى)]; (Kzw<br>\
ibid;) also called عُرْقُوبُ الأَسَدِ; (TA, as from the<br>\
S, in my copies of which I do not find this;) they<br>\
regard it as dogs following the Lion; and some<br>\
say that it is the haunches of the Lion; (Kzw ubi<br>\
suprà;) accord. to the A, it is thus called because<br>\
it rises [a mistake for sets, aurorally, (see مَنَازِلُ<br>\
القَمَرِ, in art. نزل,)] in the tail, or latter part, of<br>\
the cold, as though it were howling (كَأَنَّهُ يَعْوِى)<br>\
after it, driving it away, wherefore they call it<br>\
طَارُودَةُ البَرْدِ: (TA:) or it is an appellation applied<br>\
by the Arabs to the star that is on the edge of the<br>\
left shoulder of Virgo, which is the Thirteenth<br>\
Mansion of the Moon: or, accord. to some, the<br>\
stars that are upon her belly and beneath her<br>\
armpit; as though they were dogs howling<br>\
(تَعْوِى) behind the Lion; so called because of the<br>\
vehemence of the cold; for when they rise or set<br>\
[aurorally], they bring cold. (Kzw in his Descr.<br>\
of Virgo.) And (assumed tropical:)  [The constellation Bootes;] a<br>\
northern constellation, called also الصَّيَّاحُ, consisting of two and twenty stars within the figure, and<br>\
one without it; the figure being that of a man<br>\
having in his right hand a staff, between the stars<br>\
of الفَكَّةُ and بَنَاتُ نَعْشٍ: the one that is without<br>\
the figure is a red, bright star, between his thighs,<br>\
[i. e. Arcturus,] called السِّمَاكُ الرَّامِحُ, and, by the<br>\
Arabs, حَارِسُ السَّمَآءِ and حَارِسُ الشَّمَالِ, because it<br>\
is always seen in the sky, not becoming concealed<br>\
beneath the rays of the sun. (Kzw in his Descr.<br>\
of the Northern Constellations.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, (K,)<br>\
or the former word, (TA,) [The aged she-camel;]<br>\
the نَاب of camels; (K, TA;) on the authority of<br>\
AA. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also, both words, (K,) the former and sometimes the latter, (S,) the former said<br>\
by Az to be the more common, but MF says that<br>\
the latter is the more chaste, for the former was<br>\
by AAF absolutely disallowed, (TA,) The سَافِلَة,<br>\
(S,) or اِسْت, (K,) [each here app. meaning anus,]<br>\
of a human being; (S;) app. from عَوَى, aor.<br>\
يَعْوِى, signifying “ he cried,” or “ cried loudly:”<br>\
(TA:) as also ↓ عُوَّةٌ (IDrd, K, TA) and ↓ عَوَّةٌ,<br>\
(Lth, K, TA,) of which last the pl. is ↓ عَوٌّ [or<br>\
rather this is a coll. gen. n.] and [the pl. properly<br>\
so termed is] عَوَّاتٌ: but IAar is said to have expl.<br>\
العَوَّآءُ as meaning الأَسْتَاهُ [pl. of سَتَهٌ which is the<br>\
original of اِسْتٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
عَاوٍ [act. part. n. of عَوَى]. One says, مَا لَهُ عَاوٍ<br>\
وَلَا نَابِحٌ i. e. He has not belonging to him [a<br>\
howler nor a barker, meaning sheep, or goats,<br>\
among which the wolf howls and in the way to<br>\
which the dog barks [to defend them]. (TA.)<br>\
مُعَاوِيَةٌ A bitch excited by lust, (Lth, A, K, TA,)<br>\
that howls (تَعْوِى) to the dogs when she is in that<br>\
state, and to which they howl. (Lth, A, * TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And A fox&#39;s cub. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And أَبُو مُعَاوِيَةَ is<br>\
a surname of The فَهْد [or lynx]. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
The dim. of مُعَاوِيَةٌ is مُعَيَّةٌ; (S, K, TA;) thus<br>\
say the people of El-Basrah; for when three ى s<br>\
occur together and the first of them is the characteristic of the dim., one of them is suppressed [by<br>\
them]; (S, TA;) and مُعَيِّيَةٌ; (S, K, TA; [in the<br>\
CK مُعَيْيَةٌ;]) thus say the people of El-Koofeh,<br>\
not suppressing anything, after the manner of<br>\
those who say أُسَيِّدٌ; (S, TA;) and مُعَيْوِيَةٌ, (S,<br>\
K, TA, [in the CK مُعَيْوَةٌ,]) after the manner of<br>\
those who say أُسَيْوِدٌ. (S, TA.)<br>\
