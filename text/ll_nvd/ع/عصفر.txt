cnicus, or carthamus tinctorius;] a certain dye,<br>\
(S, O,) or plant, (Msb, K,) well known, (O, Msb,)<br>\
with which one dyes, (M,) the first juice (سُلَافَة)<br>\
of which is called جِرْيَال, (TA,) and one of the<br>\
properties of which is that it causes tough meat<br>\
to become thoroughly cooked, so as to fall off from<br>\
the bone, (K, * TA,) when somewhat thereof is<br>\
thrown into it: (TA:) its seed is called قُرْطُمٌ:<br>\
(K:) there are two kinds of it; one of the cultivated land, and one of the desert; and both grow<br>\
in the country of the Arabs: (M, TA:) it is an<br>\
Arabicized word. (Az, TA.)<br>\
عُصْفُورٌ (S, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and عَصْفُورٌ, (Ibn-Rasheek, MF,) but the latter is not an approved<br>\
form, because there is no chaste word of the<br>\
measure فَعْلُولٌ, (MF, TA,) [The sparrow;] a<br>\
certain bird, (S, O, K,) well known; (Msb:)<br>\
accord. to AHát, the same that is called the نَقَّار;<br>\

(O:) the word is masc.: (TA:) fem. with ة:<br>\

is said to have been the case when the beasts and<br>\
birds &amp;c. were summoned before Adam, to be<br>\
named by him. See the Kur ii. 29-31.] ―<br>\

became, hungry. (K, TA.) In like manner also<br>\
one says, لَا تَأْكُلْ حَتَّى تَطِيرَ عَصَافِيرُ بَطْنِكَ, meaning (tropical:)  Eat thou not until thou be hungry. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  أَصَافِيرُ المُنْذِرِ is an appellation of (assumed tropical:)  Certain<br>\

A certain vein in the heart. (IF, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\

O, K,) on the right and on the left; both being<br>\
called عُصْفُورَانِ. (S, O.) ―<br>\

camel&#39;s skin; and in it [or appertaining to the<br>\
same part] are the ظَلِفَات: (S, O:) or the nails<br>\
