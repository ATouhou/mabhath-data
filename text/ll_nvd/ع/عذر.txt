عَذَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَذِرَ, inf. n. عُذْرٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
عُذُرٌ (S, O, K) and عُذْرَى (O, K) and مَعْذِرَةٌ and<br>\
مَعْذُرَةٌ (K) [all of which are also used as simple<br>\
substs.]; and ↓ اعذرهُ; (S, O, Msb, K;) He<br>\
excused him; freed, cleared, or exempted, him<br>\
from blame; exculpated him: (Msb:) or he<br>\
accepted his excuse: properly, عَذَرْتُ signifies<br>\
I cancelled evil conduct. (TA.) [See also عُذْرٌ<br>\
below.] You say, عَذَرْتُهُ فِيمَا صَنَعَ (S, O, Msb)<br>\
I excused, or exculpated, him for what he did.<br>\
(Msb.) And in a trad. of El-Mikdád it is said,<br>\
اللّٰهُ إِلَيْكَ ↓ لَقَدْ أَعْذَرَ i.e. Verily God hath excused<br>\
thee, and exempted thee from the obligation to<br>\
fight against the unbelievers; for he had become<br>\
extremely fat, and unable to fight. (TA.) And<br>\
you say [also], عَذَرَهُ عَنِ الشَّىْءِ He excused him<br>\
for, or from, the thing. (MA.) [And accord.<br>\
to Golius,عَذَرَهُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ, as well as فِى الشَّىْءِ:<br>\
but he has not mentioned his authority: see an<br>\
explanation of عَذِيرٌ, from which the former<br>\
phrase was perhaps derived by him.] And عَذَرْتُهُ<br>\
مِنْ فُلَانٍ [I excused him, or held him excusable,<br>\
for his conduct to such a one]; meaning, I did<br>\
not blame him, but I blamed such a one. (S, *<br>\
TA.) And مَنْ يَعْذِرُنِى مِنْهُ Who will excuse me,<br>\
or make my excuse, if I requite him (Msb, TA)<br>\
for his action, (Msb,) or for his evil action,<br>\
(TA,) and will not blame me (Msb, TA) for it?<br>\
(Msb:) or who will excuse me with respect to<br>\
his case, and will not blame me for it? (Msb.)<br>\
[And a similar ex. is mentioned in the TA with<br>\
فِى in the place of مِنْ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] عَذَرَ, (Az,<br>\
S, IKtt, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
عَذِرَ; (O, TA;) and ↓ اعذر,<br>\
(S, IKtt, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِعْذَارٌ; (TA;) He was<br>\
vitious, or faulty, and corrupt: (Msb:) or he<br>\
was guilty of many crimes, sins, faults, offences,<br>\
or acts of disobedience, (S, O, Msb, K,) so as to<br>\
vender him excusable who punished him. (TA.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., لَنْ يَهْلِكَ النَّاسُ حَتَّى يَعْذِرُوا<br>\
مِنْ أَنْفُسِهِمْ, (O, and so in some copies of the S<br>\
and K,) or ↓ يُعْذِرُوا, (so in other copies of the S<br>\
and K, ) both of which readings are the same in<br>\
meaning, (TA,) i. e. [Men will not perish, or<br>\
die,] until they are guilty of many crimes, or sins,<br>\
&amp;c.; (S, O, Msb, K;) meaning, (accord. to<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd, S, O,) until they deserve punishment,<br>\
so as to render excusable him who punishes them.<br>\
(S, A, O, TA.) And you say, مِنْ نَفْسِهِ ↓ اعذر,<br>\
meaning He placed himself within the power of<br>\
another. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And عَذَرْتُهُ I aided him, or<br>\
assisted him, against an enemy. (Msb.)<br>\
-A3-  عَذَرَ,<br>\
inf. n. عَذْرٌ, He cut, or cut off. (TA: but only<br>\
the inf. n. of the verb in this sense is there mentioned.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence, probably, as is implied<br>\
in a passage in the TA, (see عُذْرَةٌ,)] عَذَرَ, aor.<br>\
عَذِرَ,<br>\
(S, O, * Msb, K) inf. n. عَذْرٌ; (S, Msb;) and<br>\
↓ اعذر; (S, O, Msb, K;) both as expl. by<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd; (S;) (tropical:)  He circumcised a boy, (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) and in like manner a girl; (S, O, Msb;)<br>\
but when a girl is the object, خَفَضَ is more common. (S, O.)<br>\
-A4-  عَذَرَ الفَرَسَ بِالعِذَارِ, aor.<br>\
عَذِرَ and<br>\
عَذُرَ; and ↓ اعذرهُ; He fastened, or bound, the<br>\
horse&#39;s عِذَار [q. v.]: (S, O, K:) and الفَرَسَ ↓ اعذر<br>\
he bridled the horse; syn. أَلْجَمَهُ; (K, TA;) as<br>\
also عَذَرَهُ, and ↓ عذّرهُ: (TA:) or ↓ اعذرهُ, (K,)<br>\
or ↓ عذّرهُ, (thus in the TA,) he put to him [or<br>\
upon him] an عِذَار; (K, TA;) and so عَذَرَهُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَذِرَ and<br>\
عَذُرَ, inf. n. عَذْرٌ: (Msb:) and ↓ اعذر<br>\
اللِّجَامَ he put to the لجام [i. e. bridle or bit] an<br>\
عِذَار. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And it is said in the Tahdheeb<br>\
of IKtt that عَذَرْتُ الفَرَسَ, inf. n. عَذْرٌ, signifies I<br>\
cauterized the horse in the place of the عِذَار: ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
and also حملت على عذاره [an explanation in<br>\
which there seems to be a mistranscription or an<br>\
omission, or both; perhaps correctly جَعَلْتُ عَلَى<br>\
الفَرَسِ عِذَارَهُ I put upon the horse his عذار; a<br>\
meaning given above]; and ↓ أَعْذَرْتُهُ is a dial.<br>\
var. thereof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عُذِرَ said of a camel<br>\
means He was branded with the mark called<br>\
عِذَار. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence, app., the phrase عَذَرَهُ<br>\
بِاللَّوْمِ (assumed tropical:)  He branded him with blame; like خَطَمَهُ<br>\
باللوم, q.v.]<br>\
-A5-  عَذَرَهُ, from العُذْرَةُ, He (God, S)<br>\
caused him (i. e. a child, TA) to be affected with<br>\
the pain, in the fauces, termed عُذْرَة: and عُذِرَ<br>\
He was, or became, affected therewith: (S, K, *<br>\
TA:) inf. n. عَذْرٌ and عُذْرَةٌ. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
عذّر, inf. n. تَعْذِيرٌ, He was without excuse;<br>\
(K, * TA;) as also ↓ عاذر, (K, TA,) inf. n. مُعَاذَرَةٌ:<br>\
(TA:) he affected to excuse himself, but had no<br>\
excuse: he excused himself, but did not adduce an<br>\
excuse [that was valid]. (TA.) [See also 8.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And He was remiss, wanting, deficient, or defective, (S, O, Msb, TA,) in an affair, (S, Msb,)<br>\
setting up an excuse [for being so]; (O;) fell<br>\
short, or did less than was incumbent on him,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, TA,) in it; (S, Msb;) did not exert<br>\
himself, or act vigorously, in it; (Msb, TA;)<br>\
causing it to be imagined that he had an excuse<br>\
when he had none. (Bd in ix. 91.) You say,<br>\
قَامَ فُلَانٌ قِيَامَ تَعْذِيرٍ Such a one acted remissly,<br>\
falling short, or doing less than was incumbent<br>\
on him. (TA.) And it is said in a story of the<br>\
Children of Israel, نَهَاهُمْ أَحْبَارُهُمْ تَعْذِيرًا Their<br>\
learned men forbade them remissly: the inf. n.<br>\
being here put in the place of the act. part. n. as<br>\
a denotative of state; as it is in جَآءَ مَشْيًا. (O,<br>\
TA.) [See also 4.]<br>\
-A2-  Also (tropical:)  He made, or prepared, a feast, (O, K,) such as is termed إِعْذَار<br>\
[q. v.] (O) or عِذَار: (K:) and he invited to a<br>\
feast such as is thus termed. (K. [Accord. to<br>\
the TA, these are two distinct significations of<br>\
the verb. See, again, 4.])<br>\
-A3-  عذّر الفَرَسَ: see 1,<br>\
latter half, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  عَذِّرْ عَنِّى بَعِيرَكَ,<br>\
(S, O,) and عَنِّى ↓ أَعْذِرْهُ, (O,) Brand thy camel<br>\
with a brand different from that of mine, in<br>\
order that our camels may be known, one from<br>\
the other. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عذّر الغُلَامُ The hair of the<br>\
boy&#39;s عِذَار (K, TA) i. e. of his cheek (TA) grew.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  عذّر الدَّارَ (inf. n. as above, TA)<br>\
He effaced the traces of the house, or dwelling.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
-A5-  عذّرهُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(S, O,) He defiled, or besmeared, it (a thing, K)<br>\
with عَذِرَة [or human dung]. (S, O, K.)<br>\
3<br>\
عَاْذَرَ see 2, first sentence. [And see also the<br>\
last clause of the last paragraph of this art.]<br>\
4<br>\
اعذر: see 1, in five places from the commencement. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He had an excuse; [or he<br>\
was, or became, excusable;] (S, O, K;) and so<br>\
↓ اعتذر. (S, O, K.) It is said in a prov., أَعْذَرَ<br>\
مَنْ أَنْذَرَ [He has an excuse, or is excusable, who<br>\
warns]. (S. [See also below: and see art. نذر.<br>\
It is held by some in the present day that the ا<br>\
in اعذر, in this phrase, has a privative effect, and<br>\
that the meaning is, He deprives of excuse who<br>\
warns: but for this I have not found any<br>\
authority.]) And Lebeed says, (S, O, TA,)<br>\
addressing his two daughters, (O, TA,) and<br>\
telling them to wail and weep a year for him<br>\
after his death, (TA,)<br>\
إِلَى الحَوْلِ ثُمَّ اسْمُ السَّلَامِ عَلَيْكُمَا<br>\
↓ وَمَنْ يَبْكِ حَوْلًا كَامِلًا فَقَدْ اعْتَذَرْ<br>\
[Until the end of the year: then the name of<br>\
peace be an you both: for such as weeps a whole<br>\
year has become excusable]. (S, O.) You say<br>\
also, أَعْذَرْتُ عِنْدَ السُّلْطَانِ I got excuse of the<br>\
Sultán [or ruling power]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He<br>\
manifested an excuse: (K, TA:) in which sense,<br>\
عُذْرٌ is said to be its inf. n., as well as إِعْذَارٌ; but<br>\
the former is correctly a simple subst. (TA.)<br>\
And He pleaded that by which he should be<br>\
excused. (TA.) [See also 8.] ―<br>\
-b4-  He did that<br>\
by which he should be excused. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  He did<br>\
that in which he should be excused: hence the<br>\
saying of Zuheyr,<br>\
*سَتَمْنَعُكُمْ أَرْمَاحُنَا أَوْ سَنُعْذِرُ<br>\
[Our spears shall prevent you, or shall defend<br>\
you,] or we will do that in which we shall be<br>\
excused. (S, O: but in the latter, وَتَمْنَعُكُمْ.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
And He exceeded the usual bounds, (A, Mgh, O,)<br>\
or went to the utmost point, (TA,) in excuse, (A,<br>\
Mgh, O, TA,) i. e. in being excused. (A.) So<br>\
in the saying أَعْذَرَ مَنْ أَنْذَرَ [He exceeds the usual<br>\
bounds in rendering himself excused who warns].<br>\
(A, Mgh, O. [See also above, third sentence.])<br>\
And it is said in a trad., لَقَدْ أَعْذَرَ اللّٰهُ إِلَى مَنْ<br>\
بَلَغَ مِنَ العُمُرِ سِتِّينَ سَنَةً [app. meaning Verily<br>\
God hath freed himself from the imputation of<br>\
injustice to an extraordinary degree, or to the<br>\
utmost point, to him who hath attained sixty<br>\
years of age:] i. e. He hath left him no plea for<br>\
excuse [for his sins], since He hath granted him<br>\
respite for all this length of time and he hath not<br>\
excused himself. (TA. [As اعذر is here followed<br>\
by إِلَى, I do not think that this explanation is<br>\
meant to show that the ا has a privative effect, and<br>\
that the verb signifies “ he deprived of excuse. ”])<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence,] He exerted himself, acted vigorously, took extraordinary pains, or exceeded the<br>\
usual bounds, [so as to render himself excused,] (S,<br>\
O, Msb, K, TA,) فِى الأَمْرِ in the affair; (S, O,<br>\
Msb;) as, for instance, in eating, in relation to<br>\
which it occurs in a trad., wherein one is enjoined<br>\
to do so when eating with others, [app. meaning<br>\
with guests and with a host,] such having been<br>\
the custom of the Prophet; for, when he ate<br>\
with others, he was the last in eating. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence also,] أَعْذَرْتُ إِلَيْكَ I took extraordinary<br>\
pains, or exceeded the usual bounds, in exhortation<br>\
and precept to thee. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And He was<br>\
remiss, wanting, deficient, or defective; he fell<br>\
short, or did less than was incumbent on him;<br>\
feigning (يُرِى [in the CK, erroneously, يُرىٰ])<br>\
that he was doing the contrary: as though the<br>\
verb bore two contrary significations. (K.) [See<br>\
also 2.]<br>\
-A2-  Also I. q. أَنْصَفَ: (O, K:) you say,<br>\
أَعْذِرْنِى مِنْ هٰذَا i. e. أَنْصِفْنِى مِنْهُ [Give thou me,<br>\
or obtain for me, my right, or due, from this<br>\
person]: and hence the saying of the Prophet to<br>\
Aboo-Bekr, respecting &#39;Áïsheh, أَعْذِرْنِى مِنْهَا إِنْ<br>\
أَدَّبْتُهَا [Obtain thou for me my right, or due, from<br>\
her if I discipline her, or chastise her]: (O:) or<br>\
this means undertake thou to excuse me [for my<br>\
conduct to her &amp;c.]: (TA:) and the Arabs say,<br>\
أَعْذَرَ فُلَانٌ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ [Such a one became bound to<br>\
render an excuse for his conduct to himself; (see<br>\
عَذِيرٌ;)] meaning such a one was destroyed by<br>\
himself. (Yoo, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  As signifying He circumcised: see 1, latter half. It is said in a trad.,<br>\
كُنَّا إِعْذَارَ يَوْمٍ وَاحِدٍ, meaning We were circumcised in one day. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  He made a<br>\
feast on the occasion of a circumcision, (AZ,<br>\
Msb, K, TA,) لِلْقَوْمِ for the people, or party:<br>\
(K:) he prepared such a feast: from the same<br>\
verb signifying “ he circumcised. ” (TA.) [See<br>\
also 2: and see إِعْذَارٌ as a subst.]<br>\
-A4-  اعذر الفَرَسَ<br>\
and اللِّجَامَ: see 1, latter half, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And أَعْذِرْ عَنِّى بَعِيرَكَ: see 2, near the end. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
أَعْذِرْ عَلَى نَصِيبِكَ Make a mark upon thy share.<br>\
(O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اعذر فِى ظَهْرِهِ He beat him (O, K) with<br>\
whips (O) so as to make a mark, or marks, upon<br>\
his back. (O, K.) And ضَرَبَهُ حَتَّى أَعْذَرَ مَتْنَهُ<br>\
He beat him so that he made the beating heavy<br>\
upon his back and obtained from him relief from<br>\
his anger. (TA.) And ضُرِبَ فَأُعْذِرَ, (S, O, K,)<br>\
in the Tahdheed of IKtt فَأَعْذَرَ, (TA,) He (a man)<br>\
was beaten so that he was at the point of death.<br>\
(S, O, K, TA.) And أُعْذِرَ مِنْهُ He had wounds inflicted upon him so that fear was excited for him<br>\
in consequence thereof. (O.) And أَعْذَرَ بِهِ He,<br>\
or it, left a scar upon him. (O, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
أَعْذَرْتُ الدَّارَ and فِى الدَّارِ I made a mark, or<br>\
marks, in, or upon, the house, or dwelling. (O.)<br>\
-A5-  اعذر also signifies He (a man, TA) voided<br>\
his ordure. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And اعذرت الدَّارُ The<br>\
house, or dwelling, had in it much عَذِرَة [or human<br>\
ordure]. (S, O.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعذّر: see 8, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He<br>\
went backwards; drew back; remained behind;<br>\
or held back: (K:) or he held back, or withheld<br>\
himself, for a cause rendering him excused. (TA<br>\
voce تَغَدَّرَ, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He fled. (K.) You<br>\
say, تعذّروا عَلَيْهِ They fled from him, and abstained from aiding, or assisting, him, or held<br>\
back from him. (O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And He resisted, and<br>\
was difficult: it is said in a trad., [respecting<br>\
Mohammad,] كَانَ يَتَعَذَّرُ فِى مَرَضِهِ He used to<br>\
resist, and be difficult, in his malady. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And تعذّر الأَمْرُ (O, K, TA) The affair was not<br>\
direct in its tendency; (K, TA;) i. e. (TA) it<br>\
was, or became, difficult: one says, تعذّر عَلَيْهِ<br>\
الأَمْرُ The affair was, or became, difficult to him.<br>\
(O, Msb, TA.) [And The affair was, or became, impracticable, or impossible.]<br>\
-A2-  تعذّر الرَّسْمُ<br>\
The رسم [i. e. trace, or relic, of an abode, or of a<br>\
place of sojourning, &amp;c.,] became effaced; (S, O,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ اعتذر: (S, *, O, * K:) or became<br>\
altered and effaced: and المَنَازِلُ ↓ اعتذرت the<br>\
places of alighting, or abode, had their traces, or<br>\
remains, effaced. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And تعذّر (from<br>\
العَذِرَةُ, S, O) He, or it, became defiled, or besmeared, (S, O, K) with عَذِرَة [or human ordure].<br>\
(K.)<br>\
8<br>\
اعتذر, (S, O, Msb, &amp;c.,) inf. n. اِعْتِذَارٌ, (S,<br>\
O, TA,) and [quasi-inf. ns.] ↓ عِذْرَةٌ and ↓ مَعْذِرَةٌ;<br>\
(TA;) and for اعتذر one says also اِعَذَّرَ, aor.<br>\
يَعَذِّرُ, inf. n. اِعِذَّارٌ; and it is allowable to say<br>\
اِعِذِّرَ, aor. يَعِذِّرُ; but the former of these two<br>\
variations is the more approved; (AHeyth, TA;)<br>\
[in the former case, the original being changed to<br>\
اِعَتْذَرَ, then to اِعَذْذَرَ, then to اِعَذَّرَ; and in the<br>\
latter case, to اِعْتْذَرَ, then to اِعِتْذَرَ, then to اِعِذْذَرَ,<br>\
then to اِعِذْرَ, and then to اِعِذِّرَ;] He excused himself; he adduced, or urged, an excuse, or a plea,<br>\
for himself; (Fr, S, * O, * TA;) as also ↓ تعذّر.<br>\
(S, O, K.) [See عُذْرٌ.] You say, اعتذر إِلَىَّ [He<br>\
excused himself to me;] he begged me to accept his<br>\
excuse; (Msb;) and AZ says, I have heard two<br>\
Arabs of the desert, one of the tribe of Temeem<br>\
and one of the tribe of Keys, say, إِلَى ↓ تَعَذَّرْتُ<br>\
الرَّجُلِ in the sense of اِعْتَذَرْتُ [i. e. I excused<br>\
myself to the man]. (TA.) And اعتذر مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ<br>\
(S, * O, * TA) and ↓ تعذّر (TA) [He excused himself, or urged an excuse, for his crime, sin, or<br>\
misdeed: or] he asserted himself to be clear of<br>\
his crime, sin, or misdeed. (TA.) And اعتذر<br>\
عَنْ فِعْلِهِ [or مِنْ فعله] He showed, or manifested,<br>\
his excuse for his deed. (Msb.) [It is said that]<br>\
the primary meaning of الاِعْتِذَارُ is The cutting a<br>\
man off from the object of his want, and from<br>\
that to which he clings in his heart. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence, perhaps, one says اعتذر meaning He<br>\
excused himself for not complying with a claim,<br>\
or request.] ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 4, in two places, near<br>\
the beginning. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also He did not adduce an<br>\
excuse. (Fr, TA.) [Thus it has two contr. significations. See also 2.]<br>\
-A2-  Also He complained,<br>\
(O, Msb, K,) مِنْهُ of him, or it. (Msb.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
And اعتذرت المِيَاهُ The waters stopped, ceased,<br>\
or became cut off. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5, last<br>\
sentence but one, in two places.<br>\
-A4-  And اعتذر<br>\
العِمَامَةَ He made the turban to have two portions<br>\
[its two ends] hanging down behind. (O, K.)<br>\
-A5-<br>\
And الاِعْتِذَارُ signifies also The act of devirginating. (S, O, [See عُذْرَةٌ.])<br>\
10<br>\
استعذر مِنْ فُلَانٍ He asked, or desired, to<br>\
be excused if he should lay violent hands upon<br>\
such a one [or requite him for an evil action]; he<br>\
said, مَنْ عَذِيرِى مِنْ فُلَانٍ. (A, TA.) It is said<br>\
in a trad. of the Prophet, اِسْتَعْذَرَ أَبَا بَكْرٍ مِنْ<br>\
عَائِشَةَ i. e. He said to Aboo-Bekr, Undertake<br>\
thou to excuse me for my conduct to &#39;Áïsheh if I<br>\
discipline her, or chastise her. (O, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And one says to him who has neglected the<br>\
giving information of a thing, (A, TA,) or to<br>\
him who reproves thee for a thing before giving<br>\
thee any command, or order, or injunction, respecting it, (O, TA,) وَاللّٰهِ مَا اسْتَعْذَرْتَ إِلَىَّ وَلَا<br>\
اسْتَنْذَرْتَ By God, thou didst not offer to me<br>\
excuse, nor didst thou offer warning. (A, O,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
عُذْرٌ (Msb, K) and ↓ عُذُرٌ (Msb) and ↓ عِذْرَةٌ<br>\
(S, O, K) and ↓ عُذْرَى (S, Msb) and ↓ مَعْذِرَةٌ<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ مَعْذُرَةٌ and ↓ مَعْذَرَةٌ (K)<br>\
[all as simple substs., but all except the third<br>\
and the last mentioned also as inf. ns.,] An<br>\
excuse; an apology; a plea whereby one excuses<br>\
himself [or another]: accord. to the B, عُذْرٌ [as a<br>\
subst. from اِعْتَذَرَ or from أَعْذَرَ] is of three kinds;<br>\
the saying “ I did it not; ” and the saying “ I did<br>\
it for such a cause,” mentioning what might<br>\
exempt him from being culpable; and the saying<br>\
“ I did it, but will not do it again,” or the like;<br>\
which third kind is the same as تَوْبَةٌ: (TA:) the<br>\
pl. of عُذْرٌ is أَعْذَارٌ; (Msb, K;) and that of ↓ عِذْرَةٌ<br>\

مُعْذِرٌ: see مُعْتَذِرٌ, in two places.<br>\

(TA.)<br>\
مَعْذُورٌ Excused; freed, cleared, or exempted,<br>\
from blame; exculpated. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,<br>\
perhaps,] مَعْذُورَةٌ applied to a woman signifies<br>\
مُسْتَحَاضَةٌ [q. v. in art. حيض]: and sometimes<br>\
one says ↓ عَاذِرَةٌ; as meaning having an excuse:<br>\
(Msb:) the latter is said to be used in the sense<br>\
of مُسْتَحَاضَةٌ; but it requires consideration; (O,<br>\
TA;) as though it were of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ in<br>\
the sense of مَفْعُولَةٌ, [i. e. in the sense of مَعْذُورَةٌ<br>\
as meaning excused,] from إِقَامَةُ العُذْرِ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\

“ Voti impos; ” as on the authority of the KL;<br>\

fauces, termed عُذْرَة. (S, O, K.)<br>\
مُعَاذِرٌ: see its pl. in the last clause of the following paragraph.<br>\
مُعْتَذِرٌ One excusing himself, whether he have,<br>\
or have not, an excuse: (TA:) the person to<br>\
whom this epithet is applied may be a speaker of<br>\
truth, and he may be not a speaker of truth:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) and so ↓ مُعَذِّرٌ, which, as applied to<br>\
a speaker of truth, signifies having an excuse,<br>\
like مُعْتَذِرٌ, (S, O, K,) [of which it is a variation,]<br>\
for the ت is changed into ذ, and this is incorporated [into the radical ذ], and its vowel is<br>\
transferred to the ع, like as is the case in<br>\
يَخَصِّمُونَ; (S, O;) and ↓ مُعِذِّرٌ is also allowable,<br>\
(S, O, TA,) and also ↓ مُعُذِّرٌ; (S, O;) but [it is<br>\
said that] ↓ مُعَذِّرٌ applied to him who does not<br>\
speak truth, (S, O, K,) being [originally] of the<br>\
measure مُفَعِّلٌ, [not a variation of مُعْتَذِرٌ,] (S, O,)<br>\
means falling short, or doing less than is incumbent on him, (S, O, K,) excusing himself (S, O)<br>\
without having any [real or valid] excuse. (S,<br>\
O, K.) In the Kur ix. 91, I&#39;Ab read ↓ المُعْذِرُونَ<br>\
[instead of the more usual reading ↓ المُعَذِّرُونَ],<br>\
(S, O, K,) and so did Yaakoob El-Hadramee,<br>\
(Az, TA,) from أَعْذَرَ; the former asserting that<br>\
it was so revealed; app. considering ↓ مُعَذِّرٌ,<br>\
with teshdeed, to apply to one not speaking<br>\
truth, (S, O, K,) meaning pretending to excuse<br>\
himself, without having any real excuse; (S, O;)<br>\
and ↓ مُعْذِرٌ to mean having an excuse: (S, O, K:)<br>\
Ibn-Abee-Leylà and Tá-oos read ↓ المُعَاذِرُونَ, as<br>\
meaning those striving, or labouring, in seeking<br>\
excuse. (O.)<br>\
