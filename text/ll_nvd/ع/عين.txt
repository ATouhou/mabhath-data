[Golius mentions also ↓ عاين, construed with ل,<br>\

-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  It was or became,<br>\

words أَخَذَ بِالعِينةِ, and in which عِينَة in a sale is<br>\
expl. as meaning نَسِيْئَة;]) and so ↓ تعيّن; (KL;)<br>\
[but Mtr says,] the saying تَعَيّنْ عَلَىّٰ حَرِيرًا as<br>\
meaning اشْتَرِهْ بِبَيْعِ العِينَةِ I have<br>\
not found. (Mgh,) [See also عيّن الرَّجُلُ expl.<br>\
as meaning “ The man took بِالعينَةِ. ”]<br>\
عَيْنٌ is a homonym, applying to various things<br>\
(Msb:) in the K. forty-seven (??)<br>\
assigned to it; but it is said by MF that its<br>\
meanings exceed a hundred; those occurring in<br>\
the Kur-án are seventeen. (TA.,) By that which<br>\
is app. its primary application, and which is by<br>\
many affirmed to (??) (TA,) العَيْنُ signifies The<br>\
eye: the organ of sight: (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA<br>\
[in the S expl. by حَاسَّةُ الرُّؤْيَةِ, evidently used in<br>\
this sense; in the Mgh, by المُبْصِرَةُ; in the Msb<br>\
and K, by البَاصِرَةُ; and in a mater place in the K.<br>\
by حَاسَّةُ الرُّؤْيَة, app. as meaning the sense of sight;])<br>\
also denoted [emphatically] by the term الجَارِحَةُ<br>\
[i. e. the organ]; (TA;) it is that with which the<br>\
looker sees: (ISk, TA;) and is of a human being<br>\
and of any other animal: (TA;) (??) is of the<br>\
fem. gender; (S, K:) and the pl. [of mult.] as<br>\
عُيُونٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) also pronounced عُيونٌ,<br>\
(K, [in which وَتُكْسَرُ, immediately following عُيُونٌ,<br>\
has been erroneously supposed by Golius and<br>\
Freytag to relate to the sing.,]) and [of pause<br>\
أَعْيَانٌ and أَعْيُنٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) which last<br>\
is asserted by Lh to be sometimes a pl. of mult.,<br>\
as it is in the Kur vii. [178 and] 194; (TA.)<br>\
and pl. pl. أَعْيُنَاتٌ: (K:) the dim. is ↓ عُيَيْنَةٌ, (S.)<br>\
Hence the saying in a trad. of &#39;Alee, قَاسَ عَيْنًا<br>\
بِبَيْضَةٍ جَعَلَ عَلَيْهَا خُطُوطًا [He measured the reach<br>\
of an eye by means of an egg upon which he made<br>\
lines]. (Mgh.) And [hence also] one says, بِعَيْنٍ<br>\
مَّا أَرَيَنَّكَ [lit. With some eye I will assuredly see<br>\
thee]: it is said to one whom you send, and require to be quick; and means (assumed tropical:)  pause not for<br>\
anything, for it is as though I were looking at<br>\
thee. (TA. [See also art. رأى.]) And لَقِيتُهُ عَيْنَ<br>\
عُنَّةٍ [I met him so that] I saw him with [or before]<br>\
my eye, he not seeing me. (S, TA.) [And رَأَيْتُهُ<br>\
عَيْنَ عُنَّةٍ or عُنَّةَ, which see in art. عن. And أَعْطَيْتُهُ<br>\
عَيْنَ عُنَّةَ and عُنَّة, which also see in art. عن.] And<br>\
رَأَيْتُهُ عَرْضَ عَيْنٍ I saw him, or it, obviously; nearly.<br>\
(TA, voce عَرْضٌ, q. v.) And هَا هُوَ عَرْضُ عَيْنٍ [or<br>\
عَرْضَ عَيْنٍ?] i. e. [Lo, he, or it, is] near [before<br>\
thee]: and in like manner, هُوَ مِنِّى عَيْنُ عُنَّةٍ [or<br>\
عَيْنَ عُنَّةٍ? i. e. He is near before me]. (K.) And<br>\
لَقِيتُهُ أَوَّلَ عَيْنٍ, (S, K,) and أَوَّلَ ذِى عَيْنٍ and<br>\
↓ عَائِنَةٍ, (TA,) I met him, or it, the first thing:<br>\
(S, K, TA:) and before every [other] thing; as<br>\
also ↓ أَوَّلَ عَائِنَةٍ and أَدْنَى عَائِنَةٍ: (S:) or this last<br>\
means the nearest thing perceived by the eye.<br>\
(TA.) And فَعَلْتُ ذَاكَ عَمْدَ عَيْنٍ and عَمْدًا عَلَى<br>\
عَيْنٍ (assumed tropical:)  I did that purposely, with seriousness, or<br>\
earnestness, and certainty: (S:) or صَنَعَ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى<br>\
عَيْنٍ and عَلَى عَيْنَيْنِ, (K, TA,) and عَمْدَ عَيْنٍ and<br>\
عَمْدَ عَيْنَيْنِ, (K,) or عَلَى عَمْدِ عَيْنٍ and عَلَى عَمْدِ<br>\
عَيْنَيْنِ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He did that purposely, (Lh, K,<br>\
TA,) with seriousness, or earnestness, and certainty.<br>\
(K.) And هُوَ عَبْدُ عَيْنٍ (tropical:)  He is like the slave to<br>\
thee as long as thou seest him, (S, K, * TA,) but<br>\
not when thou art absent; and so هُوَ عَبْدُ العَيْنِ:<br>\
(S:) or he is a man who pretends, or feigns, to<br>\
thee, his doing that which he does not perform:<br>\
(TA:) and (K, TA) in this sense, (TA,) one<br>\
says also, هُوَ صَدِيقُ عَيْنٍ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [He is a friend, or<br>\
a true friend,] as long as thou seest him: (K, TA:)<br>\
and هُوَ أَخُو عَيْنٍ (assumed tropical:)  He is one who acts as a friend<br>\
hypocritically with thee. (TA.) أَنْتَ عَلَى عَيْنِى<br>\
is said in relation to honouring and protecting:<br>\
(S, K, TA:) [accordingly I would render it<br>\
(tropical:)  Thou art entitled to be honoured and protected<br>\
by me above my eye: for the eye is esteemed the<br>\
most excellent of the organs, (as is said in this<br>\
art. in the TA,) and it is that which most needs<br>\
protection:] أَنْتَ عَلَى رَأْسِى is said in relation to<br>\
honouring only. (TA.) And the Arabs say, عَلَى<br>\
عَيْنِى قَصَدْتُ زَيْدًا, meaning thereby the regarding<br>\
with solicitude mixed with fear [so that I would<br>\
render it (assumed tropical:)  As one to be regarded with solicitude<br>\
mixed with fear above my eye I made Zeyd the<br>\
object to which my mind was directed]. (TA.)<br>\
[See another ex. of عَلَى عَيْنِى (in which it cannot<br>\
be rendered as above) in a later part of this paragraph.] نَعِمَ اللّٰهُ بِكَ عَيْنًا [in the CK نَعَّمَ, which is<br>\
wrong,] means the same as أَنْعَمَهَا. (K. [See<br>\
both in art. نعم.]) قُرَّةُ العَيْنِ [signifying مَا قَرَّتْ<br>\
بِهِ العَيْنُ, as expl. in the M and K in art. قر, i. e.<br>\
That by which, or in consequence of which, the eye<br>\
becomes cool, or refrigerated, or refreshed, &amp;c.,] is<br>\

with a broad thing, or with anything; or slapped<br>\
him with his hand: (صَكَّهُ:) or he was rough, rude,<br>\
or ungentle, to him in speech. (TA.) اَلَّذِى فِيهِ<br>\
عَيْنَاكَ means Thy head. (TA. [There mentioned<br>\
preceded by لاتحرمَن: thus dubiously, and perhaps incorrectly, written. What is means, or<br>\
should be, I know not.]) ―<br>\

are not very sweet: so says AHn: thus called as<br>\
being likened to the eyes of the animals termed<br>\
بَقَر: (TA:) they are found in Syria: (S:) or<br>\
said by some to be peculiar to Syria. (TA.) And<br>\
Certain black إِجَّاص [or plums]: (K, TA:) thus<br>\
called for the same reason. (TA.) ―<br>\

an opening in the live coals of the fire, that had<br>\

عَيْنٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The عَيْن [i. e. eye] of the<br>\
needle: such as is narrow is termed عَيْنُ صَفِيَّة<br>\
[in which the latter word is app. a proper name,<br>\

decl., i. e., in this case, written صَفِيَّةَ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also, as being likened to the organ [of sight] in<br>\

TA,) which are a fault therein, (S, TA,) like أَعْيُن<br>\

[some of] the copies of the latter of which, الرَّكِيَّة<br>\

the socket of the eye: (TA:) each knee has عَيْنَانِ<br>\
[i. e. two small hollows or cavities, the articular<br>\

ballista]: (K, * TA:) likened to the organ [of<br>\
sight] in form. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [In the B, accord. to<br>\
the TA, it is also expl. as meaning the سنام: but<br>\
this, I think, is most probably a mistranscription<br>\
for سَام (q. v.) as signifying (assumed tropical:)  The hollow, or<br>\
cavity, in the ground, thus called, in which water<br>\
remains, or stagnates, and collects.] And (tropical:)  The<br>\

the same reason, (TA,) (tropical:)  The place whence issues<br>\
the water of a well. (TA.) And, (S, Msb,<br>\

or spring, (K, TA,) of water, (S, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\

signifies a running spring:] of the fem. gender:<br>\
(TA:) pl. عُيُونٌ and أَعْيُنٌ, (Msb, K,) and accord.<br>\
to ISk, sometimes the Arabs said, as a pl. thereof,<br>\

in a trad., cited and expl. voce سَاهِرٌ. (TA.) Also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Abundance of water of a well. (TA.) And A<br>\
drop of water. (TA.) عَيْنُ المَآءِ, [originally signifying “ the source of water,”] accord. to Th, means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Life for men; thus in the following verse:<br>\
أُولَائِكَ عَيْنُ المَآءِ فِيهِمْ وَعِنْدَهُمْ<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  [Those, life for men is among them; and with<br>\

provision of corn, or abundance of the produce of<br>\
the earth, are among them. (TA.) ―<br>\

[lit. (tropical:)  The lands looked with an eye or with two<br>\
eyes], meaning, had their herbage come forth:<br>\
(K:) or it is said when their herbage comes<br>\
forth: or, as in the A, when that which cattle<br>\
depasture comes forth without [as yet] becoming<br>\
firm [in the ground, or firmly rooted]: taken<br>\
from the saying of the Arabs, إِذَا سَقَطَتِ الجَبْهَةُ<br>\
نَظَرَتِ الأَرْضُ بِإِحْدَى عَيْنَيْهَا فَإِذَا سَقَطَتِ الصَّرْفَةُ<br>\
نَظَرَتْ بِهِمَا جَمِيعًا (assumed tropical:)  [lit. When El-Jebheh (the 10th<br>\
Mansion of the Moon) sets aurorally (i. e. about<br>\

-A3-  عَيْنٌ also, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) as being<br>\

whole [person], and therefore masc.: (TA:) pl.<br>\
عُيُونٌ and أَعْيُنٌ, and, accord. to ISk, sometimes<br>\
أَعْيَانٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. مُكَاشِفٌ [app. as<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  A discoverer, or revealer, of tidings<br>\
&amp;c.]. (Es-Subkee, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  [And (assumed tropical:)  An eye as<br>\
meaning a look, i. e. an act of looking: and<br>\
hence, a stroke of an evil eye: or, simply, an evil<br>\
eye: a meaning of frequent occurrence.] أَصَابَتْ<br>\
فُلَانًا عَيْنٌ (assumed tropical:)  [An evil eye smote such a one] is said<br>\
of a person when an enemy or an envier has<br>\
looked at him and produced such an effect upon<br>\
him that he has fallen sick in consequence thereof<br>\
(TA.) [عَيْنُ الكَمَالِ is applied to an eye believed<br>\
to have the power of killing by its glance: see an<br>\
ex. voce فَقَأَ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  Sight with the eye [or<br>\
before the eyes; or ocular view]: thus in the saying,<br>\
لَا أَطْلُبُ أَثَرًا بَعْدَ عَيْنٍ (assumed tropical:)  [I will not seek a trace,<br>\
or vestige, (or, as we rather say in English, a<br>\
shadow,) after an ocular view]: (S, TA:) or the<br>\
meaning is, after suffering a reality, or substance,<br>\
to escape me: (Har pp. 120 and 174: [this latter<br>\
rendering being agreeable with explanations of<br>\
عَيْنٌ which will be found in a later part of this<br>\
paragraph:]) i. e. I will not leave the thing<br>\
when I see it ocularly, and seek the trace or<br>\
vestige, thereof, after its [the thing&#39;s] disappearing from me: and the origin of it was the fact<br>\
that a man saw the slayer of his brother, and<br>\
when he desired to slay him, he [the latter] said,<br>\
“ I will ransom myself with a hundred she-camels; ” whereupon he [the other] said, لَسْتُ<br>\
أَطْلُبُ أَثَرًا بَعْدَ عَيْنٍ; and slew him: (TA:) it is<br>\
a prov., thus, or, as some relate it, لَا تَطْلُبْ.<br>\
(Har p. 120.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  Look, or view. (K, TA.)<br>\
It is said in the Kur [xx. 40], وَالتُصْنَعَ عَلَى عَيْنِى,<br>\
(S, TA,) and it has been expl. as there having<br>\
this meaning [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  And this I did that thou<br>\
mightest be reared and nourished in my view], as<br>\
in the B; or, as Th says, that thou mightest be<br>\
reared where I should see thee: (TA:) or the<br>\
meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  in my watch, or guard, (Bd, * Jel,)<br>\
and my keeping, or protection. (Jel. [It is implied<br>\
by the context in the S, that عَلَى عَيْنِى is said in<br>\
this instance in relation to honouring and protecting, as it is in a phrase mentioned in the first<br>\
quarter of this paragraph; but my rendering of<br>\
it there is obviously inapplicable here. See also 1<br>\
in art. صنع.]) And in like manner it has been<br>\
expl. as used in the Kur [xi. 39], وَاصْنَعِ الْفُلْكَ<br>\
بِأَعْيُنِنَا (assumed tropical:)  [And make thou the ark in our view].<br>\
(TA.) [In like manner, also,] فَأْتُوا بِهِ عَلَى أَعْيُنِ<br>\
النَّاسِ, in the Kur [xxi. 62], means عَلَى مَنْظَرِهِمْ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [i. e. Then bring ye him in the view of the<br>\
people; منظر being here evidently an inf. n.];<br>\
(B, TA:) or [bring ye him] openly, or conspicuously. (Jel.)<br>\
-A5-  And (assumed tropical:)  The مَنْظَر [as meaning aspect, or outward appearance], (S, K,) and<br>\
شَاهِد [meaning the same as being an evidence of<br>\
the intrinsic qualities], (S,) of a man. (S, K.)<br>\
So in the saying of El-Hajjáj to El-Hasan [ElBasree, when he (the former) had asked مَا أَمَدُكَ<br>\
“ What was the time of thy birth? ” and the latter<br>\
had answered (see أَمَدٌ)], لَعَيْنُكَ أَكْبَرُ مِنْ أَمَدِكَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Verily thy aspect is greater than thy age],<br>\
أَمَدِكَ meaning سِنِّكَ. (S.) And it is said in a<br>\
prov.,<br>\
إِنَّ الجَوَادَ عَيْنُهُ فُرَارُهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Verily the fleet and excellent horse, his aspect is<br>\
(equivalent to) the examination of his teeth]: (S,<br>\
TA: [accord. to the latter, عَيْنُهُ meaning شَاهِدُهُ:])<br>\
i. e. his external appearance renders it needless<br>\
for thee to try him and to examine his teeth.<br>\
(S and K in art. فر, q. v.)<br>\
-A6-  Also, [by a synecdoche, as when it means “ a spy,”] (assumed tropical:)  A human<br>\
being: (K:) and any one: (S, K:) [in which<br>\
sense, as when it means “ a spy,” it may be masc.<br>\
or fem.:] and human beings: (S:) or a company<br>\
[of people]; (K;) as also ↓ عَيَنٌ: (S, K:) and<br>\
the people of a house or dwelling: (K:) and so<br>\
↓ عَيَنٌ; (S, K;) and the people of a town or<br>\
country; as also ↓ عَيَنٌ. (K.) One says, مَا بِهَا<br>\
عَيْنٌ (assumed tropical:)  There is not in it any one; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
[i. e. بِالدَّارِ in the house, or dwelling;] as also<br>\
↓ عَيَنٌ, (TA,) and ↓ عَائِنٌ, (S, TA,) and ↓ عَائِنَةٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and مَا بِهَا عَيْنٌ تَطْرِفُ [virtually meaning<br>\
the same, but fit. There is not in it an eye twinkling]. (TA.) And ↓ مَا رَأَيْتُ ثَمَّ عَائِنَةً i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [I<br>\
was not there] a human being. (TA.) And بَلَدٌ<br>\
قَلِيلُ العَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  [A town, or country,] having few<br>\
human beings, (S.) or few people. (TA.)<br>\
-A7-  And<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A lord, chief, or chief personage: (K, TA:) in<br>\
[some of] the copies of the K, السدّ or الشدّ is<br>\
erroneously put for السَّيِّدُ: (TA:) the great, or<br>\
great and noble, person of a people or party: (K,<br>\
TA:) and the head, chief, or commander, of an<br>\
army: (TA:) the pl. is أَعْيَانٌ: (TA:) which signifies [lords, chiefs, or chief personages: &amp;c.: and]<br>\
the eminent, or high-born, or noble, individuals<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, TA) of a people, or party, (S,<br>\
Mgh,) or of men; (Msb;) and the most excellent<br>\
persons. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (Mgh, Msb,) as pl.<br>\
of عَيْنٌ, (K,) أَعْيَانٌ signifies also ا Brothers from<br>\
the same father and mother: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:)<br>\
this brotherhood is termed ↓ مُعَايَنَةٌ: (S, K:) and<br>\
أَوْلَادُ الأَعْيَانِ means the sons of the same father<br>\
and mother. (Msb in art. عل. [See عَلَّةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also. the sing., (assumed tropical:)  The choice, or best, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) of a thing, (S, K,) or of goods, or<br>\
household-goods, or furniture and utensils, (Mgh,<br>\

the pl. is عِيَنٌ, (TA,) like عِيمَةٌ: (S:) ↓ عِينَةُ<br>\
الخَيْلِ signifies (assumed tropical:)  the fleet and excellent of horses.<br>\
(Lh, TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  Highly prized, in much request,<br>\
or excellent. (TA.) And, as applied to a deenár,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Outweighing, so that the balance inclines with it.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  i. q. مَالٌ, (K, TA,) [i. e. Property, or such as consists of camels or cattle,] when<br>\
of a choice. or of the best, sort. (TA.)<br>\
-A8-  And<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Such as is ready, or at hand, (K, TA,) present,<br>\
(TA,) or within one&#39;s power, or reach, (S, TA,)<br>\
of property. (S, K, TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  Anything present, or ready, (K, TA,) found before one. (TA.)<br>\
You say, بِعْتُهُ عَيْنًا بِعَيْنٍ (assumed tropical:)  I sold it ready merchandise for ready money. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Ready money; cash: or simply money: syn.<br>\
نَقْدٌ: (T, Mgh, Msb, TA:) not عَرْضٌ [q. v.]:<br>\
(Mgh:) and sometimes, دَرَاهِمُ. (Msb.) So in<br>\
the saying عَيْنٌ غَيْرُ دَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  [Ready money, not<br>\
debt]. (TA.) And [hence also] one says, اِشْتَرَيْتَ<br>\
بِالدَّيْنِ أَوْ بِالعَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  [Didst thou buy on credit or<br>\
with ready money?]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And ا A present gift. (Mgh, TA.) So in the saying (Mgh,<br>\
TA) of a rájiz (TA) satirizing a man, (Mgh,)<br>\
وَعَيْنُهُ كَالكَالِئِ الضِّمَارِ<br>\
[And his present gift is a thing not hoped for,<br>\
like the unseen debt of which the payment is deferred by the creditor:] meaning, his present<br>\
gift is like the absent that is not hoped for. (Mgh,<br>\
TA.) [And hence, app.,] أَصَابَتْهُ عَيْنٌ مِنْ عُيُونِ<br>\
اللّٰهِ, occurring in a trad., means, خَاصَّةٌ مِنْ خَوَاصِّ<br>\
اللّٰهِ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  A particular, or special, gift of God betided him]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A deenár: (S, K:) or<br>\
deenárs; (Az, TA;) [i. e.] coined gold; (Mgh, Msb; *)<br>\
different from وَرِقٌ [which signifies “ coined silver<br>\
or “ dirhems ”]. (Mgh.) They said, عَلَيْهِ مِائَةٌ عَيْنًا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [On him is incumbent the payment of a hundred<br>\
deenars]: but properly one should say عَيْنٌ, because it is identical with what precedes it (Sb,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And The half of a dánik [app. deducted]<br>\
from seven deenars: (K, TA:) mentioned by<br>\
Az. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And (tropical:)  Gold, (K, TA,) in a general<br>\
sense; as being likened to the organ [of sight],<br>\
in that the former is the most excellent of the<br>\

-A9-  And (tropical:)  The sun itself; (A,<br>\
K, TA;) as being likened to the organ [of sight],<br>\
because the former is the most noble of the stars,<br>\
like as the latter is the most noble of the organs.<br>\
(TA:) or (K, TA) the عَيْن of the sun; (S, Msb,<br>\
TA;) i. e. the شُعَاع thereof; (K, TA,) [meaning<br>\
its rays, or beams,] upon which the eye will act<br>\
remain fixed: (TA:) or [more commonly] the<br>\
عَيْن means the قُرْص [q. v., that is disk] of the<br>\
sun. (KL.) [Using it in the first of these senses.]<br>\
one says, طَلَعَتِ العَيْنُ (tropical:)  [The sun rose], and غَابَتِ<br>\
العَيْنُ [The sun set]. (Lh, TA.)<br>\
-A10-  And (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
thing&#39;s نَفْس [i. e. its self]; (S, Mgh, Msb, K,<br>\
TA;) and its ذَات [which means the same]; (K,<br>\
TA:) and its شَخْص, which means nearly, or<br>\
rather exactly, the same as its ذات; (TA;) [and<br>\
likewise a man&#39;s person, as does also ↓ عِيَانٌ, (see<br>\
exs. in Har pp. 20 and 45,) and the material substance of a thing;] and its أَصْل [as meaning its<br>\
essence, or constituent substance]: (TA:) pl. أَعْيَانٌ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, TA,) not أَعْيُنٌ nor عُيُونٌ. (Mgh,<br>\
TA.) One says, هُوَ هُوَ عَيْنًا and هُوَ هُوَ بِعَيْنِهِ (assumed tropical:)  (It<br>\
is it itself, or he is he himself]: (S, TA:) بِ when<br>\
prefixed to عَيْن, [thus] used as a corroborative,<br>\
being redundant. (Mughnee in art. بِ.) And<br>\
لَا آخُذُ إِلَّا دِرْهَمِى بِعَيْنِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [I will not take aught<br>\
save my dirhem itself]. (S.) And أَخَذْتُ مَالِى<br>\
بِعَيْنِهِ (assumed tropical:)  I took my property itself. (Msb.) And<br>\
هذِهِ أَعْيَانُ دَرَاهِمِكَ (Lh, TA) and دَرَاهِمُكَ بِأَعْيَانِهَا<br>\
(Lh, Mgh, * Msb, TA) (assumed tropical:)  These are thy dirhems<br>\
themselves]. And هُمْ إِخْوَتُكَ بِأَعْيَانِهِمْ (assumed tropical:)  [They are<br>\
thy brothers themselves]. (Msb.) And عَيْنُ الرِّبَا<br>\
occurs in a trad. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Usury itself. (TA.)<br>\
[مَوْضِعٌ بِعَيْنِهِ, a phrase very frequently occurring<br>\
in the L and TA &amp;c., means (assumed tropical:)  A certain, or particular, place: and in a similar manner بِعَيْنِهِ is<br>\

also جَآءَ بِالأَمْرِ مِنْ عَيْنٍ صَافِيَةٍ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [He brought<br>\
forth, brought to light, or declared, the affair]<br>\
from its very essence. (TA.) And بِالحَقِّ بِعَيْنِهِ<br>\

(TA.) [In grammar, اِسْمُ عَيْنٍ means (assumed tropical:)  A real<br>\
substantive; the name of a real thing; also<br>\

but it has many other significations; one of<br>\
which is essence, before mentioned as a meaning<br>\

-A15-  And it signifies also النَّاحِيَةٌ<br>\
[app. as meaning (assumed tropical:)  The part, or point, towards<br>\
which one directs himself]: (K, TA:) or, accord.<br>\
to some, particularly that of the قِبْلَة [i. e. that<br>\

(TA:) [or] it signifies also the true direction of<br>\

from the part on the right of the قبلة of El-<br>\
&#39;Irák]: (S: [see also خَسْفٌ:]) or this means, from<br>\
the direction of the قبلة of El-&#39;Irak; and the<br>\
Arabs say that this scarcely ever, or never, breaks<br>\
its promise [of giving rain]: when it rises from<br>\
the direction of the sea, and then goes northward,<br>\
one says عَيْنٌ غُدَيْقَةٌ; and this is usually most<br>\
disposed to rain: (TA:) غُدَيْقَة is a dim. of magnification, meaning abounding with water. (TA<br>\
in art. غدق.) Also (assumed tropical:)  The clouds (سَحَاب) that<br>\

withheld, on the condition of description, to a<br>\
certain future period: but it seems to be in most<br>\
cases used in one or another of the senses expl. in<br>\

one says, بَاعَهُ بِعِينَةٍ meaning بِنَسِيْئَةٍ [i. e. He sold<br>\
it upon credit, for payment at a future time]:<br>\
(A, Mgh: [see 8:]) or, as some say, [and more<br>\
commonly,] العِينَةُ is the buying what one has sold<br>\
for less than that for which one has sold it: and<br>\
↓ العَيَنُ signifies the same: (Mgh:) or, accord.<br>\
to Az, the selling a commodity for a certain price<br>\
to be paid at a certain period, and then buying it<br>\
for less than that price with ready money: [see<br>\
2, last quarter:] this is unlawful when the buyer<br>\
makes it a condition with the seller that he shall<br>\
buy it for a certain price; but when there is no<br>\
condition between them, it is allowable accord. to<br>\
Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, though forbidden by some others;<br>\
and he used to call it the sister of usury: and the<br>\
sale of a commodity by the purchaser [thereof<br>\
upon credit] to other than the seller of it, on the<br>\
spot (lit. in the sitting-place), is also termed<br>\
عِينَةٌ; but is lawful by common consent: (Msb:)<br>\
or it is the case of a man&#39;s coming to another<br>\
man to ask of him a loan, which the latter does<br>\
not desire to grant, coveting profit, which is not to<br>\
be obtained by a loan, wherefore he says, “I will<br>\
sell to thee this garment for twelve dirhems upon<br>\
credit, for payment at a certain time, and its<br>\
value is ten [which thou mayest obtain by selling<br>\
it for ready money]. ” (KT: in some copies of<br>\
which the word thus expl. is [erroneously] written<br>\
العَيْنِيَّةُ instead of العِينَةُ.) [See also زَرْنَقَةٌ. The<br>\

signifying “ ready money ” or “ ready merchandise. ”] ―<br>\
-b6-  Also The مَادَّة [meaning accession to<br>\

in my copy of that work, is written عَيَان, evidently, I think, a mistranscription for عِيَان, an<br>\
inf. n. of 3, used in the sense of a pass. part. n.,<br>\
agreeably with a well-known license, lit. meaning<br>\
ocularly seen: see ضِمَارٌ, under which I have<br>\
rendered its contrary by “ unseen; not apparent. ”] ―<br>\
-b3-  See also عَيْنٌ, latter half.<br>\
-A2-  Also A<br>\
certain iron thing among the appertenances of the<br>\
فَدَّان, (S, K,) or فَدَان [i. e. plough], this word<br>\
(فدان) written in the copies of the S, [as in the<br>\
K,] with teshdeed to the د, but, as IB says, it is<br>\
without teshdeed when signifying the implement<br>\
with which ploughing is performed: accord. to<br>\
AA, the لُؤْمَة, i. e. the سِنَّة [or share] with which<br>\
the earth is ploughed up, is called the عِيَان when<br>\
it is upon the فَدَان [or plough]: or, accord. to the<br>\
M, the عِيَان is a ring at the extremity of the لُؤْمَة<br>\
and the سليب. [app. a mistranscription] and the<br>\
دُجْرَانِ [two pieces of wood upon which the share<br>\
is bound]: (TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَعْيِنَةٌ and [of<br>\
mult.] عُيُنٌ, with two dammehs; (K;) or عِينٌ,<br>\
originally of the measure فُعْلٌ [i. e. عُيْنٌ]; (S;)<br>\
accord. to AA, عِينٌ, with kesr only; accord. to<br>\
IB, عُيُنٌ, with two dammehs, and, when the ى<br>\
is made quiescent, عِينٌ, not عُيْنٌ. (TA).<br>\
-A3-  اِبْنَا<br>\
عِيَانٍ means Two birds, (K, TA,) from the flight,<br>\
or alighting-places, or cries, &amp;c., of which, the<br>\
Arabs augur: (TA:) or two lines which are<br>\
marked upon the ground (S, K) by the عَائِف [or<br>\
augurer], by means of which one augurs, from the<br>\
flight, &amp;c., of birds; (S;) or which are made<br>\
for the purpose of auguring; (TA;) then the<br>\
augurer says, اِبْنَىْ عِيَانْ أَسْرِعَا البَيَانْ [O two sons<br>\
of &#39;Iyán, hasten ye the manifestations] (K, *<br>\
TA: [see 1 in art. خط:]) in the copies of the K,<br>\
اِبْنَا is here erroneously put for اِبْنَى or, as some<br>\
say اِبْنَا عِيانٍ means two well-known diviningarrows: (TA:) and when it is known that the<br>\
gaming arrow of him who plays therewith wins,<br>\
one says, جَرَى ابْنَا عِيَانٍ [app. meaning The two<br>\
sons of &#39;Iyán have hastened. i. e. the two arrows<br>\
so termed: as seems to be indicated by (??)<br>\
cited in the L (in which it is followed by the<br>\
words بِالشِّوَآءِ المُضَهَّبِ with the roast meat (??)<br>\
thoroughly cooked), and also by what here fel-lows]: (S, L, K. TA:) these [arrows] being<br>\
called اِبْنَ عِيَانٍ because by means of them the<br>\
people [playing at the game called المَيْسِر see<br>\

عَيَّنٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
رَجُلٌ عَيِّنٌ A man quick to weep. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And سِقَآءٌ عَيِّنٌ, (S, K,) and ↓ عَيَّنٌ, (K,) the latter<br>\
less common, and said to be the only instance of<br>\
an epithet of the measure فَيْعَلٌ with an infirm<br>\
[medial] radical, or it may be of the measure<br>\
فَوْعَلٌ or فَوْعَلٌ, and in either of these two cases<br>\
not without a parallel, (TA,) and ↓ مُتَعَيِّنٌ, (S,<br>\
K,) (assumed tropical:)  A skin, for water, or for milk, having thin<br>\
circles, or rings, or round places, [likened to eyes,]<br>\
rendering it faulty: (S:) or of which the water<br>\
runs forth: (Lh, K:) or new; (K;) or thus<br>\
عَيِّنٌ and ↓ عَيَّنٌ, in the dial. of Teiyi; and so<br>\
قِرْبَةٌ عَيِّنٌ in that dial.: the pl. of عيّن applied to<br>\
a skin is عَيَائِنُ, with hemzeh because the place<br>\
thereof is near to the end. (TA.)<br>\

And (assumed tropical:)  Flowing water: (S:) or so مَآءٌ عَائِنٌ; from<br>\
عَيْنُ المَآءِ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also عَيْنٌ, third<br>\
quarter.<br>\
عَائِنَةٌ: see عَيْنٌ, first quarter, in two places: ―<br>\

large and wide therein. (Lh, TA:) or large in<br>\
the black of the eye, with width [of the eye itself]:<br>\
(K.) fem. عَيْنَآءُ; (S:) when is applied to a<br>\
woman as meaning beautiful and wide in the eyes<br>\
(Msb:) pl. عِينٌ, (S, Msb,) originally عُيْنٌ (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence. (S,) عينٌ is an appellation of Wild<br>\
oxen; (S, K, TA:) as an epithet in which the<br>\
quality of a subst. predominates: (TA:) and<br>\
أَعْيَنُ, of the wild bull, (S, ISd, K,) which one<br>\
should not call ثَوْرٌ أَعْيَنُ: (ISd, K:) and عَيْنَآءُ,<br>\
of the (??) (S:) and women are likened to<br>\
these wild animals. (TA,) ―<br>\
-b3-  عَيْنَاءُ also signifies,<br>\

to a ?? i. q. ??: (K) [i. e. accord. to the TK.<br>\
which is followed by Freytag, applied to a rhyme<br>\
or meaning Having what is termed ??: (see De<br>\
Sacy&#39;s Ar. (??), see, ed., ii. 657) but this explanation may be conjectural; and, (??) the meaning may be (assumed tropical:)  (??) an effective an applied<br>\
to a verse on an ode] ―<br>\
-b6-  And i. q. ?? (K)<br>\
[accord. to the TK as an epithet applied to land,<br>\
and meaning (assumed tropical:)  Black likened to the eye of the<br>\
buffalo; for ?? was sometimes termed by the<br>\
Arabs خُضْرَة. but this explanation also may be<br>\
conjectural; and ا rather think that it is so, and<br>\
that by خَضْرآءِ is here meant (assumed tropical:)  a bucket with which<br>\
water has been drawn long, so that it has become<br>\
green or blackish; (see أَخْضرْ,) agreeably with<br>\
the following explanation, which is immediately<br>\
subjoined in the K]. ―<br>\

a mistranscription. for بِمَعَانٍ, as in Har p. 22,]<br>\
The people, or party are [in a place] where thou<br>\
sees them with thine eye. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A place<br>\

alighting or abode, &amp;c.,] (TA.)<br>\
مَعِينٌ Smitten with the [evil] eye; as also<br>\
↓ مَعْيُونٌ, the complete form: (S, TA:) or,<br>\
accord. to Ez-Zejjájee, the former has this meaning, but ↓ المَعْيُونُ means اَلَّذِى فِيهِ عَيْنٌ [in which<br>\
the last word is probably a mistranscription for<br>\
عَيْبٌ; so that the meaning is, in whom is a fault,<br>\
or defect], (L, TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely,<br>\
&#39;Abbás, (TA,)<br>\
قَدْ كَانَ قَوْمُكَ يَحْسَبُونَكَ سَيِّدًا<br>\
↓ وَإِخَلُ أِنَّكَ سَيِّدٌ مَعْيُونُ<br>\
[Thy people, or party, used to reckon thee a chief;<br>\
but I think that them art a chief (??) with the<br>\

El-Hudhalee says.<br>\
↓ مَآءٌ يُجِمُّ لِحَافِرٍ مَعْيُونِ<br>\
[meaning Water collecting for a digger of which<br>\
the springs have been reached by digging]; the<br>\
last word, it as said, being put by him in the<br>\
gen. case because of the proximity (??) a word (??)<br>\
that case, agreeably with a poetic license of which<br>\
there are many (??)<br>\
مَعْيُونٌ, as it is an epithet (??)<br>\
Respecting the measure of مَعِينٌ, which (??)<br>\
from عَيْنُ المَآءِ. and explain as meaning (??)<br>\
the source apparent, (??)<br>\
(??) some say that it is an (??) of مَفْعُولٌ<br>\
though not having a verb; and some, that<br>\
of the measure فَعِيلٌ, from المعْنُ signifying the<br>\
drawing of water. (TA.) In the say إِنْ<br>\
كَانَتِ البَشَرُ مَعِينًا لَا تُنْزَحُ, meaning [If the (??)<br>\
one] having a running spring, (that was not (??)<br>\
entirely exhausted,] معينا is made masc. to (??)<br>\
with the word [??, which is masc. in form though<br>\
fem. by usage]; or it is thus because (??)<br>\
imagined to be of the measure فَعِيل, in the sense<br>\
of the measure مَفْعُول; or because it is for<br>\
ذَاتَ مَعِينٍ, i. e. [having] water running upon the<br>\
surface of the earth. (Mgh.) In the Kur xxxvii.<br>\
44. [and in like manner in lvi. 18.] مَعِين is used<br>\
as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Wine running upon the surface of<br>\
the earth, like rivers of water. (Jel.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عَيْنٌ<br>\
↓ مَعْيُونَةٌ means (assumed tropical:)  A spring, or source, having<br>\
a continued increase of water (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
مُعَيَّنٌ (assumed tropical:)  A garment figured with eyes (S in<br>\
art. برج:) or a garment in the figuring of which<br>\

from the generality, or aggregate: &amp;c.: see the<br>\

distinct: and it is allowable for one to attribute<br>\
the action to the purpose, tropically; and thus to<br>\
