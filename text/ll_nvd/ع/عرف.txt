عَرَفَهُ, (S, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
عَرِفَ, (O, K,)<br>\
inf. n. مَعْرِفَةٌ (S, O, K) and عِرْفَانٌ (S, O, Msb, K)<br>\
and عِرِفَّانٌ (K) and عِرْفَةٌ, (Msb, K,) or مَعْرِفَةٌ is a<br>\
simple subst., (Msb,) He knew it; he had cognition of it; or he was, or became, acquainted with<br>\
it; syn. عَلِمَهُ: (K:) or he knew it (عَلِمَهُ) by<br>\
means of any of the five senses; (Msb;) [and also,<br>\
by mental perception:] Er-Rághib says, المَعْرِفَةُ<br>\
is the perceiving a thing by reflection, and by consideration of the effect thereof [upon the mind or<br>\
sense], so that it has a more special meaning than<br>\
العِلْمُ, and its contr. is الإِنْكَارُ; and one says, فُلَانٌ<br>\
يَعْرِفُ اللّٰهَ وَرَسُولَهُ [Such a one knows God and his<br>\
apostle], but one does not say يَعْلَمُ اللّٰهَ, making<br>\
the verb [thus] to have a single objective complement, since man&#39;s مَعْرِفَة [or knowledge] of God<br>\
is [the result of] the consideration of his effects,<br>\
without the perception of his essence; and one<br>\
says, اَللّٰهُ يَعْلَمُ كَذَا, but not يَعْرِفُ كذا, since<br>\
المَعْرِفَةُ is used in relation to عِلْم [or knowledge]<br>\
which is defective, to which one attains by reflection: it is from عَرَفْتُهُ meaning I found, or experienced, its عَرْف i. e. odour; or as meaning I<br>\
attained its عُرْف i. e. limit: (TA:) it is said in<br>\
the B that المَعْرِفَةُ differs from العِلْمُ, in meaning,<br>\
in several ways: the former concerns the thing<br>\
itself [which is its object;] whereas the latter<br>\
concerns the states, or conditions, or qualities,<br>\
thereof: also the former generally denotes the<br>\
perceiving a thing as a thing that has been absent<br>\
from the mind, thus differing from the latter;<br>\
therefore the contr. of the former is الإِنْكَارُ, and<br>\
the contr. of the latter is الجَهْلُ; and the former<br>\
is the knowing a thing itself as distinguished from<br>\
other things; whereas the latter concerns a thing<br>\
collectively with other things: (TA in art. علم:)<br>\
and sometimes they put ↓ اعترف in the place of<br>\
عَرَفَ; (S, O;) [i. e.] اعترف الشَّىْءَ signifies عَرَفَهُ:<br>\
(Mgh, K:) and so, sometimes, does ↓ استعرفُه.<br>\
(Har p. 486.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَرَفَ is also used in the<br>\
place of اعترف [in the first of the senses assigned<br>\
to the latter below]. (S, O.) See the latter verb,<br>\
in four places. ―<br>\
-b3-  عَرَفَهُ also signifies He requited<br>\
him. (O, K.) Ks read, (O, K,) and so five<br>\
others, (Az, TA,) in the Kur [lxvi. 3], (O,) عَرَفَ<br>\
بَعْضَهُ, meaning He requited her, namely, Hafsah,<br>\
for part [thereof, i. e.] of what she had done:<br>\
(Fr, O, K:) and he did so indeed by divorcing<br>\
her: (Fr, TA:) or it means he acknowledged<br>\
part thereof: (K:) but others read بَعْضَهُ ↓ عَرَّفَ,<br>\
which, likewise, has the former of the two meanings expl. above: (Bd:) or this means he told<br>\
Hafsah part thereof. (Fr, O, Bd, * TA. [See<br>\
also 2.]) As first expl. above, this phrase is like<br>\
the saying to him who does good or who does<br>\
evil, أَنَا أَعْرِفُ لأَهْلِ الإِحْسَانِ وَأَعْرِفُ لِأَهْلِ الإِسَآءَةِ,<br>\
(O,) or لِلْمُحْسِنِ وَالمُسِىْءِ, (K,) [I know how to<br>\
requite the doer of good and the doer of evil,] i. e.<br>\
the case of the doer of good and that of the doer<br>\
of evil are not hidden from me nor is the suitable<br>\
requital of him. (O, K.) لَأَعْرِفَنَّكَهَا عَنْدَ رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ<br>\
occurs in a trad., meaning I will assuredly requite<br>\
thee for it in the presence of the Apostle of God so<br>\
that he shall know thy evil-doing: and is used in<br>\
threatening. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَرَفَ الفَرَسَ, (S, O, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَرِفَ, (O,) inf. n. عَرْفٌ, (O, K,) He clipped the<br>\

عَرُفَ, inf. n. عِرَافَةٌ, I was, or<br>\
became, عَرِيف over the people, or party; i. e.,<br>\
manager, or orderer, of their affairs; as also<br>\
عَرُفْتُ عَلَيْهِمْ: (Msb:) or عَرُفَ, inf. n. عَرَاعَةٌ, signifies he was, or became, an عَرِيف; (S, O, K;)<br>\
as also عَرَفَ, aor.<br>\
عَرِفَ; (K;) i. e., a نَقِيب: (S, O:)<br>\
and when you mean that he acted as an عَرِيف,<br>\
you say, عَرَفَ عَلَيْنَا سِنِينَ, aor.<br>\
عَرُفَ, inf. n. عِرَافَةٌ,<br>\
[he acted over us as an عريف during some years,]<br>\
like كَتَبَ, aor. يَكْتُبُ, inf. n. كِتَابَةٌ. (S, O, K. *)<br>\
-A4-  عَرَفَ لِلْأَمْرِ, aor.<br>\
عَرِفَ, He was patient in relation<br>\
to the affair, or event; (K;) as also ↓ اعترف,<br>\
(O, K,) as some say. (O.) And عُرِفَ عِنْدَ المُصِيبَةِ<br>\
He was patient on the occasion of the affliction,<br>\
or misfortune. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَرَفَ He was, or<br>\
became, submissive, or tractable; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád,<br>\
O, TA;) and so ↓ اعترف, (IAar, O, K,) said of<br>\
a man, (IAar, O,) and of a beast that one rides.<br>\
(O.)<br>\
-A5-  عَرُفَ, inf. n. عَرَافَةٌ, He (a man) was, or<br>\

-b2-  عَرِفَ He (a man,<br>\
TA) made much use of perfume. (IAar, O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And He relinquished, or abstained from, perfume. (IAar, O.)<br>\
-A6-  عُرِفَ, (S, O, K,) inf. n.<br>\
عَرْفٌ, (K, TA,) accord. to one or more of the<br>\
copies of the K عِرْفَانٌ, (TA,) He (a man, S, O)<br>\
had a purulent pustule, termed عَرْفَة, come forth<br>\
in the whiteness [or palm] of his hand. (S, O, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
تَعْرِيفٌ signifies The making to know; syn.<br>\
إِعْلَامٌ: (S, O, K, TA:) [or rather it has a more<br>\
restricted signification than the latter word, as is<br>\
indicated in the preceding paragraph:] and in<br>\
this sense its verb may have two objective complements: one says, عرّفهُ الأَمْرَ He made him to<br>\
know the affair, or case; syn. أَعْلَمَهُ إِيَّاهُ: [or he<br>\
acquainted him with it; or told him of it:] and<br>\
عرّفهُ بَيْتَهُ He made him to know, or acquainted<br>\
him with, the place of his house, or tent; syn.<br>\
أَعْلَمَهُ بِمَكَانِهِ: (TA:) [and] one says عَرَّفْتُهُ بِهِ,<br>\
meaning I made him to know it by means of any<br>\
of the five senses [or by mental perception; as also<br>\
عَرَّفْتُهُ إِيَّاهُ]. (Msb.) See also 1, former half.<br>\
And see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The making known; contr.<br>\
of تَنْكِيرٌ. (O, K.) عَرَّفَ بَعْضَهُ, in the Kur [lxvi. 3],<br>\
has been expl. as meaning He made known part<br>\
thereof. (TA. [For other explanations, see 1.])<br>\
And عَرَّفْتُهُ بِزَيْدٍ means I made him known by<br>\
the name of Zeyd; like the phrase سَمَّيْتُهُ بِزَيْدٍ.<br>\
(Sb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, The explaining a term:<br>\
and an explanation thereof: thus used, its pl. is<br>\
تَعْرِيفَاتٌ: it has a less restricted meaning than<br>\
حَدٌّ, which signifies the “ defining,” and “ a<br>\
definition. ” ―<br>\
-b4-  And The making a noun, or a<br>\
nominal proposition, determinate. ―<br>\
-b5-  Hence also,]<br>\

thing that has been lost; (S, TA;) the mentioning<br>\
it [and describing it] and seeking to find him who<br>\
had knowledge of it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And [hence likewise,] عرّفهُ بِذَنْبِهِ He branded him, or stigmatized<br>\
him, with his misdeed. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The rendering [a thing] fragrant; (S, O, * K, * TA;)<br>\
from العَرْفُ: (S:) and the adorning [it], decorating [it], or embellishing [it]. (TA.) عَرَّفَهَا لَهُمْ,<br>\
in the Kur [xlvii. 7], is said to mean He hath<br>\
rendered it fragrant [i. e. Paradise (الجَنَّة)] for<br>\
them: (S, O:) or it means He hath described it<br>\
to them so that, when they enter it, they shall<br>\
know it by that description, or so that they shall<br>\
know their places of abode therein: (O:) or He<br>\
hath described it to them, and made them desirous<br>\
of it: (Er-Rághib, TA:) [and the like is said by<br>\
Bd:] or He hath defined it for them so that there<br>\
shall be for every one a distinct paradise. (Bd.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, عرّف رَأْسَهُ بِالدُّهْنِ He moistened the hair of his head abundantly with oil, or<br>\
with the oil; syn. رَوَّاهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\

He made his food to have much seasoning, or<br>\
condiment. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also The halting [of the<br>\

(S, Mgh, O, Msb,) inf. n. as above, They halted<br>\
at &#39;Arafát; (Mgh, Msb;) or they were present<br>\
at &#39;Arafát; (S, O.) And [hence], in a postclassical sense, They imitated the people of &#39;Arafát, in some other place, by going forth to the<br>\
desert and there praying, and humbling themselves,<br>\
or offering earnest supplication; (Mgh;) or by<br>\
assembling in their mosques to pray and to beg<br>\
forgiveness: (Har p. 672:) the first who did<br>\
this was Ibn-&#39;Abbás, at El-Basrah. (Mgh, and<br>\
Har ubi suprá.) And عرّف بِالهَدْىِ He brought<br>\
the animal for sacrifice to &#39;Arafát. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A4-<br>\
عرّف الشَّرَّ بَيْنَهُمْ He excited evil, or mischief, between them, or among them: the verb in this<br>\
phrase being formed by permutation from أَ َّ ثَ.<br>\
(Yaakoob, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اعرف فُلَانًا He told such a one of his misdeed,<br>\
then forgave him; and so ↓ عرّفهُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اعرف<br>\

mane]. (S, O, K.)<br>\
-A3-  See also 1, near the end.<br>\
5<br>\
تعرّف It was, or became, known. (Har p. 6.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And تعرّف إِلَيْهِ He made himself known to<br>\
him; (TA;) [and so ↓ استعرف; for] you say,<br>\
أَتَيْتُ مُتَنَكِّرًا ثُمَّ اسْتَعْرَفْتُ i. e. [I came disguising<br>\
myself, or assuming an unknown appearance, then]<br>\
I made known who I was: (L:) and اِئْتِ فُلَانًا<br>\
فَاسْتَعْرِفْ إِلَيْهِ حَتَّى يَعْرِفَكَ [Come thou to such a<br>\
one and make thyself known to him, that he may<br>\
know thee]. (S, O, K. *) [See also 8.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,]<br>\
one says, تعرّف إِلَى اللّٰهِ بِالعِبَادَاتِ وَالأَدْعِيَةِ [He<br>\
made himself known to God by religious services<br>\
and prayers]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) And تَعَرَّفْ إِلَى<br>\
اللّٰهِ فِى الرَّخَآءِ يَعْرِفْكَ فِى الشِّدَّةَ, occurring in a saying of the Prophet to Ibn-&#39;Abbás, [may be rendered Make thyself known to God by obedience<br>\
in ampleness of circumstances, then He will<br>\
acknowledge thee in straitness: or] means render<br>\
thou obedience to God [&amp;c., then] He will requite<br>\
thee [&amp;c.]. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  تعرّفهُ [He acquainted himself, or made himself acquainted, with it, or him;<br>\
informed himself of it; learned it; and discovered<br>\
it: often used in these senses: for an instance of<br>\
the last, see تَفَرَّسَ: it is similar to تَعَلَّمَهُ, but<br>\
more restricted in meaning. ―<br>\
-b2-  And] He sought<br>\
the knowledge of it: (Har p. 6:) [or he did so<br>\
leisurely, or repeatedly, and effectually:] you say,<br>\
تَعَرَّفْتُ مَا عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ I sought leisurely, or repeatedly,<br>\
after the knowledge of what such a one possessed<br>\
until I knew it. (S, O, K. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  And تعرّفهُ المَكَانَ,<br>\
and فِى المَكَانِ, He looked at it, endeavouring to<br>\
obtain a clear knowledge thereof, in the place;<br>\
syn. تَأَمَّلَهُ بِهِ. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  [تَعَرُّفٌ is also expl. in<br>\
the KL by the Pers. words بعرف كارى كردن,<br>\
app. meaning The acting with عُرْف i. e. goodness,<br>\
&amp;c.: but Golius has hence rendered the verb<br>\
“ convenienter opus fecit. ”]<br>\
6<br>\
تعارفوا They knew, or were acquainted with,<br>\
one another. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. تَفَاخَرُوا<br>\
[i. e. They vied, competed, or contended for superiority, in glorying, or boasting, or in glory, &amp;c.;<br>\
or simply they vied, one with another]: it occurs<br>\

are expl. as having this meaning. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اعترف بِهِ He acknowledged it, or confessed<br>\
it, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) namely, a misdeed, (S,<br>\
O,) or a thing; (Mgh, Msb;) and so به ↓ عَرَفَ<br>\
and لَهُ, namely, his misdeed [&amp;c.]; (K;) [for]<br>\
sometimes they put عَرَفَ in the place of اعترف;<br>\
(O;) and so ↓ عَرَفَهُ: (Ksh and Bd and Jel in<br>\
xvi. 85:) [الإِحْسَانِ ↓ عِرْفَانُ (occurring in the K<br>\
voce شُكْرٌ &amp;c.) means The acknowledgment, or<br>\
confession, of beneficence; thankfulness, or gratitude:] and one says, لأَِحَدٍ يَصْرَعُنِى ↓ مَا أَعْرِفُ<br>\
(S, O, TA) i. e. ما أَعْتَرِفُ, (S, O,) meaning I do<br>\

-b2-  اعترف إِلَىَّ He acquainted me with his name<br>\
and condition. (K.) And اعترف لَهُ He described<br>\

―<br>\
-b3-  اعترف also signifies He described a thing<br>\
that had been picked up, and a stray-beast, in<br>\
such a manner as that he would be known to be<br>\

(S, O,) or فُلَانًا, (K,) I asked the people, or<br>\
party, (S, O,) or such a one, (K,) respecting a<br>\

And see 1, last quarter, in two places.<br>\

استعرف [He sought, or desired, knowledge;<br>\
or asked if any had knowledge; of a person or<br>\
thing: a meaning clearly shown in the M by an<br>\
explanation of a verse cited in art. بلو, conj. 8,<br>\
q. v.]. ―<br>\

-b2-  اعرورف الفَرَسَ He (a<br>\
man, O) mounted upon the mane (عُرْف) of the<br>\

(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Said of the sea, (tropical:)  Its<br>\
waves became high, (S, O, K, TA,) like the عُرْف<br>\

became dense, and luxuriant, or abundant, or<br>\
thickly intermixed, like the عُرْف [or mane] of the<br>\
hyena. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And, said of a man,<br>\
(tropical:)  He prepared himself for evil, or mischief, (S, O,<br>\
K, TA,) and raised his head, or stretched forth<br>\
his neck, for that purpose. (TA.) [See also 12<br>\
in art. عزف.]<br>\
عَرْفٌ An odour, whether fragrant or fetid, (S,<br>\
O, K, TA,) in most instances the former, (K,<br>\
TA,) as when it is used in relation to Paradise:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ عَرْفَةٌ signifies [the same, i. e.] رِيحٌ<br>\
(K, TK) and رَائِحَةٌ. (TK.) One says, ما أَطْيَبَ<br>\

(S, O;) applied to the low, ignoble, mean, or<br>\
sordid, who will not cease from his evil doing;<br>\
he being likened to the hide that is not fit for<br>\
being tanned; (O, K;) wherefore it is cast aside,<br>\
and becomes fetid. (O.) And some read, in the<br>\
Kur [lxxvii. 1], وَالْمُرْسَلَاتِ عَرْفًا, [as meaning By<br>\
the winds that are sent forth with fragrance,]<br>\
instead of عُرْفًا. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain plant:<br>\
or the ثُمَام [or panic grass]: (K:) or a certain<br>\
plant, not of the [kind called] حَمْض, nor of the<br>\
[kind called] عِضَاه; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, L, K;) of<br>\
the [kind called] ثُمَام. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, L.)<br>\
عُرْفٌ [Acknowledgment, or confession;] a subst.<br>\
from الاِعْتِرَافُ, (S, O, K, TA,) as meaning الإِقْرَارُ.<br>\

عُرْفًا, meaning اِعْتِرَافًا [i. e. A thousand is due to<br>\
him on my part by acknowlegment, or confession];<br>\

good quality or action; and gentleness, or lenity;<br>\
and beneficence, [favour, kindness, or bounty,] or<br>\
a benefit, a benefaction, or an act of beneficence<br>\

expl. as signifying liberality, or bounty; (K,<br>\
TA;) and so ↓ عُرُفٌ, which is a dial. var. thereof:<br>\
(TA:) and a thing liberally, or freely, bestowed;<br>\
or given: (K:) and ↓ مَعْرُوفٌ is expl. as signifying liberality, or bounty, when it is with moderation, or with a right and just aim: [and sometimes it means simply moderation:] and sincere,<br>\
or honest, advice or counsel or action: and good<br>\
fellowship with one&#39;s family and with others of<br>\
mankind: it is an epithet in which the quality of<br>\
a subst. predominates: (TA:) and signifies any<br>\
action, or deed, of which the goodness is known by<br>\
reason and by the law; and مُنْكَرٌ signifies the<br>\
contr. thereof. (Er-Rághib, TA.) It is said in<br>\
the Kur [vii. 198], وَأْمُرْ بِالْعُرْفِ, (O,) meaning<br>\
[And enjoin thou goodness, &amp;c., or] what is deemed<br>\
good, or approved, of actions. (Bd.) And you<br>\

him, a benefit, &amp;c.]. (S, O, TA.) وَلِلْمُطَلَّقَاتِ<br>\
↓ مَتَاعٌ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ [in the Kur ii. 242] means [And<br>\

وَمَغْفِرَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ صَدَقَةٍ يَتْبَعُهَا أَذًى [in the same,<br>\
ii. 265,] means Refusal with pleasing [or gracious] speech, (Bd, Jel, TA,) and prayer [expressed to the beggar, that God may sustain him,]<br>\
(TA,) and forgiveness granted to the beggar for<br>\
his importunity (Bd, Jel) or obtained by such<br>\
refusal from God or from the beggar, (Bd,) are<br>\
better than an alms which annoyance follows<br>\
(TA) by reproach for a benefit conferred and for<br>\
begging. (Jel.) And مَنْ كَانَ فَقِيرًا فَلْيَأْكُلْ<br>\
↓ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ [in the same, iv. 6,] means [And such<br>\

meaning that of a particular class; as, for instance, of the lawyers. Hence the terms حَقِيقَةٌ<br>\
عُرْفًا and مَجَازٌ عُرْفًا, expl. in arts. حق and جوز.<br>\
See also مُتَعَارَفٌ: and see عَادَةٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  Also The عُرْف<br>\

the part, of the neck [of a bird], which is the place<br>\
of growth of the feathers: (TA:) [or the feathers<br>\

to which the بَظْر of a girl is likened: (Msb:) pl.<br>\
أَعْرَافٌ [properly a pl. of pauc.] (O, TA) and<br>\
عُرُوفٌ. (TA.) As used it in relation to a man,<br>\
explaining the phrase جَآءَ فُلَانٌ مُبْرَثِلًّا لِلشَّرِّ as<br>\
meaning نَافِشًا عُرْفَهُ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Such a one came as<br>\
though ruffling the feathers of his neck to do evil,<br>\
or mischief]. (TA.) And [hence] it is said in a<br>\
trad., جَاؤُوا كَأَنَّهُمْ عُرُفٌ (assumed tropical:)  [They came as though<br>\
they were a mane], meaning, following one another.<br>\
(TA.) And one says, جَآء القَوْمُ عُرْفًا عُرْفًا (assumed tropical:)  [The<br>\
people, or party, came] one after another: like the<br>\
saying, طَارَ القَطَا عُرْفًا (assumed tropical:)  [The sand-grouse flew] one<br>\
after another. (K.) And hence, وَالْمُرْسَلَاتِ عُرْفًا,<br>\
(S, O, K,) in the Kur [lxxvii. 1], a metaphorical<br>\
phrase, from the عُرْف of the horse, meaning (tropical:)  [By<br>\
the angels, or the winds, that are sent forth] consecutively, like [the several portions of] the عُرْف<br>\
[or mane] of the horse: (S, O:) or the meaning<br>\
is, sent forth بِالْمَعْرُوفِ, (S, O, K, TA,) i. e. with<br>\
beneficence, or benefit: (TA:) [for further explanations, see the expositions of Z and Bd or<br>\
others: and see also art. رسل:] some read عَرْفًا<br>\

likewise (assumed tropical:)  an elevated place: (K:) and the first,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  the elevated, or overtopping, back of a portion<br>\

that is upon the [channels for irrigation that are<br>\
called] فُلْجَان [pl. of فَلَجٌ] and قَوَائِد [pl. of<br>\

-b4-  [The pl.] الأَعْرَافُ, (S, O, K,)<br>\
mentioned in the Kur [vii. 44 and 46], (S, O,) is<br>\
applied to (assumed tropical:)  A wall between Paradise and Hell:<br>\
(S, O, K:) so it is said: (S, O:) or the upper<br>\
parts of the wall: or by عَلَى الأَعْرَافِ may be<br>\
there meant عَلَى مَعْرِفَةِ أَهْلِ الجَنَّةِ وَأَهْلِ النَّارِ [i. e.,<br>\
app., and possessing knowledge of the people of<br>\
Paradise and of the people of Hell: for it seems<br>\
that مُحْتَوُونَ, or the like, is to be understood before على]. (Zj, TA.) [And hence it is the name<br>\
of The Seventh Chapter of the Kur-án.] By<br>\
أَصْحَابُ الأَعْرَافِ [The occupants of the اعراف],<br>\
there mentioned, are said to be meant persons<br>\
whose good and evil works have been equal, so<br>\
that they shall not have merited Paradise by the<br>\
former nor Hell by the latter: or prophets: or<br>\
angels. (Zj, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also عُرْفَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b6-  [The pl.]<br>\
أَعْرَافٌ also signifies (tropical:)  The higher, or highest, (K,<br>\
TA,) and first, or foremost, (TA,) of winds; (K,<br>\
TA;) and likewise of clouds, and of mists.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And عُرْفٌ signifies also, (As, O, K,) in<br>\
the speech of the people of El-Bahreyn, (As, O,)<br>\
A species [or variety] of palm-trees; (As, O, K;)<br>\
and so [the pl.] أَعْرَافٌ (O, K) is expl. by IDrd:<br>\
(O:) or when they first yield fruit, or edible<br>\
fruit, or ripe fruit; (K, TA;) or when they<br>\
attain to doing so: (TA:) or a [sort of] palmtree in El-Bahreyn, also called بُرْشُوم; (K, TA;)<br>\
but this is what is meant by As and IDrd. (TA.)<br>\

-A3-  Also pl. of عَرُوفٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and of<br>\
أَعْرَفُ and عَرْفَآءُ. (K.)<br>\
عِرْفٌ, with kesr, is from the saying, مَا عَرَفَ<br>\

first sentence. In the O, it seems to be regarded<br>\
as a simple subst.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also عَرْفَةٌ.<br>\
يَوْمُ عَرَفَهَ The ninth day of [the month] ذُو الحِجَّة<br>\
[when the pilgrims halt at عَرَفَات]: (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K:) the latter word being without tenween,<br>\
(S, O,) imperfectly decl., because it is of the fem.<br>\
gender and a proper name, (Msb,) and not admitting the art. ال. (S, O, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
the next paragraph.<br>\
عَرَفَاتٌ The place [or mountain] where the pilgrims halt (Mgh, O, Msb, K) on the day of عَرَفَة<br>\
[above mentioned], (O, K,) [described by Burckhardt as a granite hill, about a mile, or a mile<br>\
and a half, in circuit, with sloping sides, rising<br>\
nearly two hundred feet above the level of the<br>\
adjacent plain,] said to be nine miles, (Msb,) or<br>\
twelve miles, (K,) from Mekkeh; (Msb, K;) said<br>\
by J to be a place in, or at, Minè, but incorrectly, (K, TA,) unless thereby be meant near<br>\
Minè; (TA;) also called by some ↓ عَرَفَةُ;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb;) but the saying نَزَلْنَا عَرَفَةَ, (S, O,<br>\
K,) or نَزَلْتُ بِعَرَفَةَ, (Msb,) [We, or I, alighted<br>\
at عَرَفَة,] is like a post-classical phrase, (S, O, K,)<br>\
and (S, O) it is said to be (Msb) not genuine<br>\
Arabic: (S, O, Msb:) عَرَفَاتٌ is a [proper] name<br>\
in the pl. form, and therefore is not itself pluralized: (S, O, K:) it is as though the term عَرَفَةٌ<br>\
applied to every distinct portion thereof: (TA:)<br>\
as Fr says, it has, correctly, no sing.; (S, O;)<br>\
and it is determinate as denoting a particular<br>\
place; (Sb, S, O, K, TA;) and therefore not admitting the article ال; (Sb, TA;) differing from<br>\
الزَّيْدُونَ [because this is a proper name common<br>\
to a number of persons]: you say, هٰؤُلَآءِ عَرَفَاتٌ<br>\
حَسَنَةً [lit. These are &#39;Arafát, in a good state],<br>\
putting the epithet in the accus. case because it is<br>\
indeterminate [as a denotative of state, like مُصَدِّقًا<br>\
in the saying وَهُوَ الحَقُّ مُصَدِّقًا لِمَا مَعَهُمْ, in the<br>\
Kur ii. 85]: (S, O:) it is decl. (مَصْرُوفَةٌ [more<br>\
properly مُعْرَبَةٌ]) because the ت is equivalent to<br>\
the ى and و in مُسْلِمِينَ and مُسْلِمُونَ, (S, O,<br>\
K,) the tenween becoming equivalent to the ن,<br>\
therefore, being used as a proper name, it is left<br>\
in its original state, like as is مُسْلِمُونَ when<br>\
used as a proper name: (Akh, S, O, K:) [i. e.,]<br>\
it is decl. in the manner of مُسْلِمَاتٌ and مُؤْمِنَاتٌ,<br>\
the tenween being like that which corresponds to<br>\
the masc. pl. termination ن, not the tenween of<br>\
perfect declinability, because it is a proper name<br>\
and of the fem. gender, wherefore it does not<br>\
admit the article ال. (Msb.) عَرَفَاتٌ was thus<br>\
named because Adam and Eve knew each other<br>\
(تَعَارَفَا) there (IF, O, K, TA) after their descent<br>\
from Paradise: (TA:) or because Gabriel, when<br>\
he taught Abraham the rites and ceremonies of<br>\
the pilgrimage, said to him “ Hast thou known? ”<br>\
(أَعَرَفْتَ), (O, K,) and he replied “ I have known ”<br>\
(عَرَفْتُ): (K:) or because it is a place sanctified<br>\
and magnified, as though it were rendered<br>\
fragrant (عُرِّفَ i. e. طُيِّبَ): (O, K:) or because<br>\
the people know one another (يَتَعَارَفُونَ) there:<br>\
or, accord. to Er-Rághib, because of men&#39;s<br>\
making themselves known (نِتَعَرُّفِ العِبَادِ) there<br>\
by religious services and prayers. (TA.)<br>\

an epithet; (O;) occurring in a poem of Er-Rá&#39;ee, and expl. by some as the name of a companion of his: (O, K: *) and عُرُفَّانٌ signifies the<br>\

-A2-  Also the latter, (O,) or both, (K,) A<br>\

One who knows his companions: pl. عُرَفَآءُ. (O,<br>\

Msb:) it is said that he is over a few persons, and<br>\
the مَنْكِب is over five عُرَقَآء, then the أَمِير is over<br>\
these. (Msb.) It is said in a trad. that the عُرَفَآء<br>\
are in Hell, as a caution against undertaking the<br>\
office of chief, or head, on account of the trial<br>\
that is therein; for when one does not perform<br>\
the duty thereof, he sins, and deserves punishment. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [It is now used as meaning A<br>\

عِرَافَةٌ The holding, and the exercising, of the<br>\

the latter is one who informs of the past and of<br>\
the future: (Msb:) or, accord. to Er-Rághib,<br>\
[but the converse of his explanation seems to be<br>\
that which is correct,] the former is one who informs of future events, and the latter is one who<br>\
informs of past events. (TA.) Hence the saying<br>\

عَارِفٌ and ↓ عَرِيفٌ are syn., (S, O, K,) like عَالِمٌ<br>\
