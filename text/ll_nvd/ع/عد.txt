عَدَّهُ, (S, A, O, Msb, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
عَدُ3َ, (O,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. عَدٌّ (S, O, Msb, K) and عِدَّةٌ and<br>\
تَعْدَادٌ [which last has an intensive signification,<br>\
and may also be regarded as an inf. n. of the<br>\
verb next following]; and ↓ عدّدهُ; (TA;) or<br>\
this latter has an intensive signification; (Msb;)<br>\
He numbered, counted, reckoned, or computed, it:<br>\
(S, A, O, Msb, K:) [and ↓ اِعْتَدَّهُ sometimes<br>\
signifies the same, as is shown by what here<br>\
follows:] فَمَا لَكُمْ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِنْ عِدَّةٍ تَعْتَدُّونَهَا, in the<br>\
Kur xxxiii. 48, means [Then there shall not be<br>\
for you, as incumbent on them, any عِدَّة (q. v.)]<br>\
of which ye shall count the number [of the days]:<br>\
(Bd, Jel:) or the meaning is, of which ye shall<br>\
exact the accomplishment of the number [of the<br>\
days]: (Ksh, Bd:) and Lh has mentioned, as<br>\
heard from the Arabs, عَدَدْتُ الدَّرَاهِمَ أَفْرَادًا and<br>\
وِحَادًا [I counted the dirhems by single pieces],<br>\
and ↓ أَعْدَدْتُ, also, followed by the same words;<br>\
then adding, “I know not whether it [i. e. the<br>\
latter] be from العَدَدُ or from العُدَّةُ ” [i. e.<br>\
whether the meaning be I counted or I prepared<br>\
or provided, the latter of which is a well-known<br>\
meaning]: his doubt indicates that أَعْدَدْتُ is a<br>\
dial. var. of عَدَدْتُ; but [SM says] “ I know it<br>\
not.” (TA.) عَدَّ is doubly trans.: you say<br>\
عَدَدْتُكَ المَالَ as well as عَدَدْتُ لَكَ المَالَ [both<br>\
meaning I numbered, counted, reckoned, or computed, to thee the articles of property]. (TA.)<br>\
And you say, عُدَّ فِى قَوْمٍ He was numbered, or<br>\
reckoned, among a people, or party. (S, K.)<br>\
[And عَدَّ مَحَاسِنَهُ, and ↓ عَدَّدَهَا, inf. n. of the<br>\
former عَدٌّ, and of either تَعْدَادٌ, He enumerated,<br>\
or recounted, his good qualities or actions: a<br>\
phrase of frequent occurrence.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also He<br>\
counted, or reckoned, as meaning he accounted, or<br>\
esteemed, him, or it, good or bad &amp;c.:] one says<br>\
عَدَّهُ حَسَنًا He counted, accounted, reckoned, or<br>\
esteemed, him, or it, good, or goodly; syn.<br>\
اِسْتَحْسَنَهُ: (S in art. حسن, &amp;c.:) and ↓ اعتدّ<br>\
signifies the same as عَدَّ [in this sense]; whence<br>\
the saying,<br>\
وَيَعْتَدُّهُ قَوْمٌ كَثِيرٌ تِجَارَةً<br>\
[And many people count it, or reckon it, as merchandise]. (Har p. 127.)<br>\
2<br>\
عَدَّ3َ see above, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  عدّدهُ also<br>\
signifies He made it a provision against the<br>\
casualties of fortune: (S, O, K: see also 4:) so,<br>\
accord. to Akh, in the Kur civ. 2: or, as some<br>\
say, he made it numerous: (S, O:) or it may<br>\
mean he reckoned it (Bd and Jel in civ. 2) time<br>\
after time. (Bd.)<br>\
3<br>\

الفِخَارِ وَمُعَادَّةِ بَعْضِهِمْ بَعْضًا [i. e. The day of vying,<br>\
or contending for superiority, in glory, or excellence,<br>\

[See also عِدَادٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  عَادَّهُمُ الشَّىْءَ He shared with<br>\
them equally in the thing: and عادّ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا<br>\
فِى الشَّىْءِ They shared one with another in the<br>\
thing; i. e., in anything. (TA.) [Hence,] one<br>\
says, عادّهُ فِى المِيرَاثِ [He shared with him in<br>\
the inheritance]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [The inf. n.] عِدَادٌ also<br>\
signifies The contributing equally, or clubbing, for<br>\
the purchase of corn, or food, to eat: and a<br>\
people&#39;s having money, or property, divided into<br>\

IAar, and O in the present art.;) and مُنَاهَدَةٌ.<br>\

خَيْبَرَ تُعَادُّنِى (S, O, K) The pain of the poison of<br>\
the food of Kheyber which I ate has not ceased to<br>\

the expiration of a year. (S, O, K.)<br>\

with which ↓ اِعْتِدَادٌ and ↓ اِسْتِعْدَادٌ and ↓ تَعْدَادٌ<br>\

prepared it, or provided it. (Msb, TA. *) One<br>\
says, اعدّهُ لِأَمْرِ كَذَا He made it ready, prepared<br>\
it, or provided it, for such an affair. (S, O, K. *)<br>\
And أَعْدَدْتُ لِلْأَمْرِ عُدَّتَهُ [I made ready, prepared,<br>\
or provided, for the affair, its proper apparatus].<br>\
(TA.) Some say that أَعَدَّ is originally أَعْتَدَ;<br>\
but others deny this. (L in art. عتد.) See also<br>\
1, former half.<br>\
-A2-  أَعَدَّ is also intrans.: [but<br>\
when it is used as such, نَفْسَهُ may be considered<br>\
as understood after it:] see 10.<br>\
5<br>\
تَعَدَّ3َ [تعدّد It was, or became, numerous: often<br>\

-b2-  Hence, one says,] هُمْ<br>\

ten thousand; and ↓ يَتَعَادُّونَ signifies the same;<br>\

-b3-  See also 10.<br>\

thing. (TA.) See also 5. [And see 3.]<br>\
7<br>\
انعدّ: see what next follows.<br>\
8<br>\
اعتدّ It was, or became, numbered, counted,<br>\
reckoned, or computed. (S, O.) Many of the<br>\
learned say that ↓ انعدّ should not be [thus] used<br>\
as a quasi-pass. of عَدَّهُ: it is said to be vulgar,<br>\
or bad. (MF.)<br>\
-A2-  اعتدّهُ: see 1, first and last<br>\
sentences. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also اعتدّ بِهِ (S, O, Msb)<br>\
meaning He included it in a numbering, or<br>\
reckoning. (Msb.) [And hence, He made account of it; accounted it a matter of importance.<br>\
And لَا يُعْتَدُّ بِهِ No account is made of it, or<br>\
him; it, or he, is not reckoned, or esteemed, as<br>\
of any account, or importance: a phrase of<br>\
frequent occurrence.]<br>\

prepared it, or provided it:] see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
10.<br>\

mentioned by Th, (TA,) He made himself ready,<br>\

عَدْعَدَةٌ below.]<br>\
Q. Q. 2<br>\
تَمَعْدَدَ, in which, accord. to Sb, the<br>\
م is a radical letter, because of the rarity of the<br>\
measure تَمَلْعَلَ, but others contradict him, (S,<br>\
K, *) He assumed the dress, garb, habit, or<br>\
external appearance, of the sons of Ma&#39;add who<br>\
was the son of &#39;Adnán, and who is called the<br>\
Father of the Arabs [because through him all<br>\
the descendants of Ismá&#39;eel, or Ishmael, trace<br>\
their ancestry], (S, O, K,) imitating them in their<br>\

used by the poet Maan Ibn-Ows for تَبَاعَدَ [He<br>\
went, or withdrew himself, far away]: (S, O:) it<br>\
means thus, and he went away into the country,<br>\
or in the land. (TA.)<br>\
عَدْ عَدْ A cry by which the mule is chidden;<br>\
(AZ, O, K;) like عَدَسْ. (AZ, O.)<br>\
عُدٌّ and ↓ عُدَّةٌ Pustules in the face: (IJ, TA:)<br>\
or pustules that come forth in the faces of beautiful, or goodly, persons: (O, K:) pl. of the former<br>\
[and app. of the latter also, which is probably a<br>\
n. un.,] أَعْدَادٌ. (Marg. note in a copy of the S.)<br>\
عِدٌّ Multitude, muchness, or abundance, (S, O,<br>\
K,) in a thing. (K.) One says, إِنَّهُمْ لَذَوُو عِدٍّ<br>\
وَقِبصٍ (in one of my copies of the S and in the O<br>\
لَذُو, and in the other of my copies of the S and in<br>\

dial. of Bekr Ibn-Wáïl, little water: (AO, TA:)<br>\
or well-water, whether little or much; so accord.<br>\
to a woman of Kiláb; opposed to that of the rain:<br>\

that this is a mistake: (TA:) pl. أَعْدَادٌ. (S, A,<br>\
O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And حَسَبٌ عِدٌّ (tropical:)  Old nobility or the like:<br>\
(M, A, O:) accord. to IDrd, from عِدٌّ applied to<br>\
old water that does not become exhausted. (TA.<br>\
[This derivation is probably correct: but see<br>\
above.])<br>\
-A2-  See also عَدِيدٌ.<br>\
-A3-  And see the paragraph here following.<br>\
عُدَّةٌ Apparatus, equipments or equipage, accoutrements, furniture, gear, tackle or tackling, (S, O,<br>\
L, Msb,) that one has prepared for the casualties<br>\

some, formed from عُتْدَةٌ [q. v.]; but others deny<br>\
this: (L in art. عتد:) pl. عُدَدٌ. (Msb.) One says,<br>\
أَخَذَ لِلْأَمْرِ عُدَّتَهُ and عَتَادَهُ [He took, for the affair,<br>\
his apparatus, &amp;c.; or he prepared, or provided,<br>\

(S, K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عِدَّةُ المَرْأَةِ The days of the menstruation of the woman, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
which she numbers, when she has been divorced, or<br>\
when her husband has died; [until the expiration<br>\
of which she may not marry again; the period<br>\
being, in the case of a divorced woman, not<br>\
pregnant, that of three menstruations]; or [in<br>\
the case of a pregnant woman] the days of her<br>\
pregnancy; or [in the case of a widow not pregnant] four months and ten nights: (TA:) or the<br>\
woman&#39;s waiting the prescribed time after divorce,<br>\
or after the death of her husband, until she may<br>\
marry again: (Msb:) and the days of the<br>\
woman&#39;s mourning for a husband, and of abstaining from the wearing of ornaments &amp;c.; (K, TA;)<br>\
whether it be a period of months or of menstruations, or the period completed by her giving birth<br>\
to offspring in her womb, which she has conceived<br>\
by her husband: (TA:) pl. عِدَدٌ. (Msb.) One<br>\
says, اِنْقَضَتْ عِدَّتُهَا Her عِدَّة ended, (S, TA,) from<br>\
the period of the death of her husband, or of his<br>\
divorcing her. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اِنْقَضَتْ عِدَّةُ الرَّجُلِ<br>\
means The man&#39;s term of life ended: pl. عِدَدٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And one says, فُلَانٌ إِنَّمَا يَأْتِى أَهْلَهُ<br>\
العِدَّةَ Such a one comes to his wife, or family,<br>\
only once in the month, or in the two months. (O,<br>\
L.) See also عِدَادٌ, in two places.<br>\
عَدَدٌ a subst. from عَدَّهُ “ he numbered it; ” as<br>\
also ↓ عَدِيدٌ: (S, O, K:) [originally] What is<br>\
numbered, counted, reckoned, or computed: (O,<br>\
Msb, K: [in the CK, a و is inadvertently omitted<br>\
after the explanation of this meaning:]) [and<br>\
hence,] a number; (Msb;) and ↓ عَدِيدٌ is syn.<br>\
therewith [in this sense, as will be seen in what<br>\
follows]; (A;) a quantity composed of units; and<br>\
therefore not [properly] applicable to one; but<br>\
accord. to the grammarians, one belongs to the<br>\
predicament ofالعَدَدُ because it is the root thereof,<br>\
and because it implies quantity, for when it is said<br>\
“ How many hast thou? ” it is as proper to answer<br>\
“ One ” as it is to answer “ Three ” &amp;c.: (Msb:)<br>\
pl. أَعْدَادٌ. (TA.) ↓ مَا أَكْثَرَ عَدِيدَهُمْ means عَدَدَهُمْ<br>\
[i. e. How great is their number!]. (A.) Zj says<br>\
that عَدَدٌ is sometimes used in the sense of an<br>\
inf. n.; as in the phrase in the Kur [xviii. 10],<br>\
سِنِينَ عَدَدًا: but many say that it is in this instance<br>\
used in its proper sense, meaning مَعْدُودَةً [i. e.<br>\
numbered], and is made masc. because سِنِين is<br>\
syn. with أَعْوَام. (Msb.) In the phrase وَأَحْصَى<br>\
كُلَّ شَىْءٍ عَدَدًا, in the Kur [lxxii. last verse], it is<br>\
used in its proper sense of مَعْدُودًا, and is put in<br>\
the accus. case as a denotative of state; or it is<br>\
used in this case as an inf. n. (IAth, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It<br>\
signifies also The years of a man&#39;s life, which one<br>\
numbers, or counts. (IAar, O, K. [In the CK,<br>\
after the words وَالعَدَدُ المعدُودُ, a و should be<br>\
inserted.]) Hence the phrase رَقَّ عَدَدُهُ The years<br>\
of his life, which he numbered, became few, the<br>\
greater part having passed. (IAar, O.)<br>\
عِدَدٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
عِدَادٌ an inf. n. of 3 [q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  يَوْمُ العِدَادِ<br>\
[as expl. by Sh: see 3, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also]<br>\
The day of giving: (S, O:) العِدَاد signifies العَطَآء<br>\
(S, O, K) in this phrase. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And i. q.<br>\
يَوْمُ العَرْضِ [which generally means The day of<br>\
the last judgment]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And one says,<br>\
أَتَيْتُ فُلَانًا فِى يَوْمِ عِدَادٍ meaning I came to such<br>\
a one on a Friday (يوم حُمُعَةٍ), or on a Minor<br>\
Festival (يوم فِطْرٍ), or on a Great Festival (يوم<br>\
أَضْحَى). (O, K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And لَقِيتُ فُلَانًا عِدَادَ<br>\
الثُّرَيَّا, (S, O, K,) or عِدَادَ الثُّرَيَّا القَمَرَ, and فِى<br>\
نُزُولِ القَمَرِ الثُّرَيَّا, (TA,) meaning I met such<br>\
a one once in the month: (S, O, K:) because the<br>\
moon makes its abode in الثريّا [the Pleiades, its<br>\
third Mansion,] once in every month: (S, O:)<br>\
IB [understood the meaning to be, once in the<br>\
year; for he] asserts that, correctly, J should<br>\
have said, because the moon is in conjunction<br>\
with الثريّا once in every year, and that is on the<br>\
fifth day of [the Syrian month] Ádhár [corresponding to March O. S.], agreeably with what<br>\
is said in a verse of Ibn-Holáhil which will be<br>\
found cited in what follows: but [this verse evidently relates to what was the case in its author&#39;s<br>\
time; for it is well known that] the moon traverses<br>\
the firmament once in every month, and is every<br>\
night in a [different], Mansion, and it is therefore<br>\
in [the Mansion of] الثريّا once in every month.<br>\
(L, TA.) [Accord. to some,] one says, لَا آتِيكَ<br>\
إِلَّا عِدَادَ القَمَرِ الثُّرَيَّا, meaning I will not come to<br>\
thee save once in the year: because the moon<br>\
makes its abode in الثريّا but once in the year:<br>\
(A:) and مَا يَأْتِينَا فُلَانٌ إِلَّا عِدَادَ الثُّرَيَّا القَمَرَ, and<br>\
إِلَّا قِرَانَ القَمَرِ الثُّرَيَّا, meaning Such a one comes<br>\
not to us save once in the year: and مَا أَلْقَاهُ إِلَّا<br>\
الثُّرَيَّا القَمَرَ ↓ عِدَّةَ, and الّا عِدَادَ الثُّرَيَّا القَمَرَ, and<br>\
الّا عِدَادَ الثُّرَيَّا مِنَ القَمَرِ, meaning I do not meet<br>\
him save once in the year: (TA:) [but these<br>\
explanations are probably founded upon a want<br>\
of due consideration of a statement which here<br>\
follows:] after citing this verse of Aseed, or<br>\
Useyd, or Useiyid, [written in the TA اسيد,]<br>\
Ibn-Holáhil, or Ibn-El-Holáhil, [thus differently<br>\
written in different places,]<br>\
إِذَا مَا قَارَنَ القَمَرُ الثُّرَيَّا<br>\
لِثَالِثَةِ فَقَدْ ذَهَبَ الشِّتَآءُ<br>\
[When the moon is in conjunction with the Pleiades<br>\
in a third night, then winter has departed], AHeyth<br>\
said, [as though what was the case at a particular<br>\
period of a cycle were the case generally,] the<br>\
moon is in conjunction with الثريّا only in a third<br>\
night from the new moon, [meaning only once in<br>\
the year in the third night,] and that is in the<br>\
beginning of spring and the end of winter. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  And عِدَادٌ and ↓ عِدَدٌ, (S, O, K,) the latter a<br>\
contraction of the former, used by poetic license,<br>\
(S, O,) signify A paroxysm of pain which a person stung or bitten by a venomous reptile suffers on<br>\
the completion of a year from the day on which<br>\
he was stung or bitten: (S, O, K: *) a paroxysm<br>\
of pain occurring at a certain period: (A:) a<br>\
paroxysm such as that of a tertian, or quartan,<br>\
fever; and the pain of poison which kills at a<br>\
certain period: and the regular period of the<br>\
return of a fever is called its عِدَاد. (TA.) One<br>\
says, أَتَتْهُ اللَّسْعَةُ لِعِدَادٍ The pain of the venomous<br>\
sting, or bite, returned to him with vehemence at<br>\
the expiration of a year. (S, O, * K.) And بِهِ<br>\
مَرَضٌ عِدَادٌ He has a malady that intermits and<br>\
returns. (A.) And عِدَادُ السَّلِيمِ is said to signify<br>\
A period of seven days from that on which the<br>\
person has received a venomous sting or bite:<br>\
when it has expired, his recovery is hoped for:<br>\
as long as it has not expired, one says, هُوَ فِى<br>\
عِدَادِهِ. (A, TA.) [See also 3.] ―<br>\
-b8-  عِدَادٌ signifies<br>\
also The time of death. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And A day,<br>\
or night, when the family of a person deceased<br>\
assemble together to wail for him. (ISk, TA.)<br>\

-b2-  Also A<br>\
man who introduces himself into a tribe, to be<br>\
numbered, or reckoned, as belonging to it, but has<br>\
no kindred in it: (Msb:) or عَدِيدٌ قَوْمٍ signifies<br>\
one who is numbered, or reckoned, among a people,<br>\
(K, TA,) but is not with them (معهم [app. a mistranscription for مِنْهُمْ of them]); as also ↓ عِدَادٌ.<br>\
(TA.) One says, فُلَانٌ عَدِيدُ بَنِى فُلَانٍ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
O, Msb,) and ↓ مِنْ عِدَادِهِمْ, (Msb,) Such a one<br>\
is numbered, or reckoned, among the sons of such<br>\
a one. (S, Mgh, O, Msb.) And فِى بَنِى ↓ عِدَادُهُ<br>\
فُلَانٍ He is numbered among the sons of such a<br>\
one in the دِيوَان [or register of soldiers or pensioners]. (S, O, K.) And أَهْلِ ↓ فُلَانٌ فِى عِدَادِ<br>\

هٰذِهِ These dirhems are equal to these. (A, * TA.)<br>\
And هُمْ عَدِيدُ الحَصَى وَالثَّرَى They are equal in<br>\
multitude, or quantity, to the pebbles and the moist<br>\
earth; (S, * O, * TA;) i. e. they are innumerable.<br>\
(TA.) The saying of Aboo-Duwád, describing a<br>\
mare,<br>\
وَطِمِرَّةٍ كَهِرَاوَةِ الأَعْزَابِ لَيْسَ لَهَا عَدَائِدْ<br>\
Th explains by saying that he likens her to the<br>\
staff of the wayfarer, because of her being smooth,<br>\
as though عدائد here meant knots: [so that, accord.<br>\
to him, we should render the verse thus: And<br>\
compact in make, or swift and excellent, like the<br>\
staff of those who go far away with their camels<br>\
to pasture, having no knots:] but Az says that<br>\
the meaning is, [like Hiráwet-el-Aazáb (a celebrated mare)], having no equals. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also عِدَادٌ, last sentence but one.<br>\
عَدِيدَةٌ A lot, portion, or share: (IAar, O, K:)<br>\
like غَدِيدَةٌ: (IAar, O:) pl. عَدَائِدُ; (IAar, O,<br>\
TA;) with which ↓ عِدَادٌ is syn.: and عَدَائِدُ<br>\
signifies also property divided into shares; and<br>\
an inheritance [so divided]. (TA.) Lebeed says,<br>\
تَطِيرُ عَدَائِدُ الأَشْرَاكِ شَفْعًا<br>\
وَوِتْرًا وَالزَّعَامَةُ لِلْغُلَامِ<br>\
The portions of property and inheritance of the<br>\
sharers fly away in the course of time, two together and singly; but the lordship, or mastery,<br>\
is still remaining for the boy: (IAar, TA:) or<br>\
the poet means those who share with him [i. e.<br>\
with the boy] (مَنْ يُعَادُّهُ) in the inheritance: or<br>\
it (عدائد) is from عُدَّةُ المَالِ [i. e. what one prepares for a future time, of property]: (S, O:)<br>\
for عدائد, in this verse, some read غَدَائِدُ. (L in<br>\
art. غد [q. v.]) [See also زَعَامَةٌ.]<br>\
عِدَّانٌ and عَدَّانٌ The time, or period, of a thing;<br>\
(IAar, K, TA;) as in the phrase أَنَا عَلَى عَدَّانِ<br>\
ذٰلِكَ I was at the time, or period, of that; (IAar,<br>\
TA;) and in the saying جِئْتُ عَلَى عَدَّانِ تَفْعَلُ<br>\
ذٰلِكَ I came at the time of thy doing that; (TA;)<br>\
and thus in the saying كَانَ ذٰلِكَ عَلَى عَدَّانِ فُلَانٍ<br>\
That was in the time of such a one: (S, O:) or<br>\
the first, and best, or most excellent, part, (K,<br>\
TA,) and the most, (TA,) of a thing; (K, TA;)<br>\
accord. to Az, from أَعَدَّهُ “ he prepared it; ” and<br>\
so in the saying كَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى عَدَّانِ شَبَابِهِ and<br>\
مُلْكِهِ [That was in the first and best and chief<br>\
part of his young manhood and of his dominion].<br>\
(TA.) [See also art. عدن.]<br>\
-A2-  عِدَّانٌ as a contraction of عِتْدَانٌ: see عَتُودٌ, of which it is a pl.<br>\
عَدْعَدَةٌ inf. n. of عَدْعَدَ [q. v.]. (IAar, O.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
And The cry, or crying, of the sand-grouse<br>\
(القَطَا): (A &#39;Obeyd, O, K:) app. onomatopoetic.<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, O.)<br>\
جَيْشٌ أَعَدُّ An army in the most complete state<br>\
of preparation, or equipment. (TA, from a trad.)<br>\
مَعَدٌّ The side (ISd, TA) of a man and of a<br>\
horse &amp;c.: (L in art. معد [in which it is fully<br>\
explained]:) المَعَدَّانِ signifies the places of the<br>\
two boards of the saddle (S, * O, * A, K, * TA)<br>\
upon the two sides of the horse. (A, TA.) One<br>\
says, عَرِقَ مَعَدَّاهُ [The parts of his sides beneath<br>\
the two boards of the saddle sweated]. (A, TA.)<br>\
اللِّبْسَةُ المَعَدِّيَّةُ The mode of dress of the sons of<br>\
Ma&#39;add, which was coarse and rude. (S, from a<br>\
trad. [See Q. Q. 2.])<br>\
مَعْدُودٌ [meaning Numbered, counted, reckoned,<br>\
or computed,] is applied to any number, little or<br>\
large; but مَعْدُودَاتٌ more particularly denotes<br>\
few; and so does every pl. formed by the addition of ا and ت, as دُرَيْهِمَاتٌ and حَمَامَاتٌ;<br>\
though it is allowable to use such a pl. to denote<br>\
muchness. (Zj, TA.) الأَيَّامُ المَعْدُودَاتُ signifies<br>\
The days called أَيَّامُ التَّشْرِيقِ; (S, Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
K;) the three days next after the day of the<br>\
sacrifice [which is the tenth of Dhu-l-Hijjeh];<br>\
thus called because they are few. (TA.) And<br>\
one also says دَرَاهِمُ مَعْدُودَةٌ [lit. Numbered, or<br>\
counted, dirhems] as meaning a few dirhems.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
المُعَيْدِىُّ is the dim. of المَعَدِّىُّ, (S, O, K,)<br>\
meaning He whose origin is referred to Ma&#39;add,<br>\
(S, O, TA,) and is originally المُعَيْدِدِىُّ, then<br>\
المُعَيْدِّىُّ, and then المُعَيْدِىُّ, (IDrst, TA,) thus<br>\
pronounced without the teshdeed of the د because<br>\
the double teshdeed, (IDrst, S, O, K, TA,) that<br>\
of the د with that of the ى after it, (IDrst, TA,)<br>\
is found difficult of pronunciation, (IDrst, S, O,<br>\
K, TA,) combined with the ى that denotes the<br>\
dim.: (S, O, K:) it is thus pronounced in the<br>\
prov., أَنْ تَسْمَعَ بِالْمُعَيْدِىِّ خَيْرٌ مِنْ أَنْ تَرَاهُ [Thy<br>\
hearing of the Mo&#39;eydee is better than thy seeing<br>\
him]: (Ks, S, O:) or تَسْمَعُ بالمعيدىّ خير من<br>\
ان تراه, (K, TA,) which means the same, the ع<br>\
in تسمع being pronounced with damm because<br>\
أَنْ is suppressed before it; but some pronounce<br>\
it with nasb, regarding أَنْ as understood, though<br>\
this is anomalous: (TA:) or تَسْمَعُ بِالْمُعَيْدِىِّ لَا<br>\
أَنْ تَرَاهُ; as though meaning hear thou of the<br>\
Mo&#39;eydee, but do not see him: (ISk, S, O, K:)<br>\
of which three variants, the second is that which<br>\
is best known: so says A &#39;Obeyd: (TA:) the<br>\
prov. is applied to him who is of good repute,<br>\
but whose outward appearance is contemned.<br>\
(S, O, K, TA. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov.<br>\
i. 223.])<br>\
مُعْتَدٌّ بِهِ A thing included in a numbering, or<br>\
reckoning. (Msb.) [And hence, A thing of which<br>\
account is made; that is accounted a matter of<br>\
importance. See the verb.]<br>\
مُسْتَعِدَّاتٌ is used in a verse of Ibn-Mukbil as<br>\
meaning The legs of a she-camel. (AA, TA voce<br>\
أَطَامِيمُ, q. v.)<br>\
