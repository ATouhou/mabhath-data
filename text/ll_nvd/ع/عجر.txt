عَجَرَ عُنُقَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَجِرَ, inf. n. عَجْرٌ, He bent his<br>\
neck, (ISk, S, O, K, TA,) and twisted it: said<br>\
of one who desires not to comply with a command<br>\
to do a thing: or عَجَرَ عُنُقَهُ إِلَى كَذَا وَكَذَا [he<br>\
bent, and twisted, his neck, turning towards such<br>\
and such things,] is said of one who is going in a<br>\
particular direction, and returns from it to a<br>\
thing behind him which he is forbidden: so in<br>\
the Nawádir el-Aaráb. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And one says,<br>\
عَجَرَ بِهِ بَعِيرُهُ as though meaning His camel returned with him towards his usual associates and<br>\
his family when he was desiring to ride him in a<br>\
particular direction; as also عَكَرَ بِهِ. (ISk, S, O.)<br>\

-b3-  And عَجَرَ الفَرَسُ,<br>\
(S, O,) aor.<br>\

horse extended [or, accord. to an explanation of the<br>\
act. part. n. in the L, raised] his tail towards his<br>\
عَجُز [or. croup] in running. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
hence, (S,) مَرَّ الفَرَسُ يَعْجِرُ (S, O, K *) and يَعْجُرُ,<br>\
(so in one of my copies of the S, and accord. to<br>\
the TA,) inf. n. عَجْرٌ (S, K) and عَجَرَانٌ, (K,)<br>\
The horse went along swiftly, (S, O, K, *) by<br>\
reason of briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness,<br>\
(O,) or from fear and the like: and ↓ مُعَاجَرَةٌ is<br>\
syn. with the inf. ns. of يَعْجِرُ used in this sense:<br>\
(K:) [so that one says in like manner ↓ مَرَّ يُعَاجِرُ:]<br>\
and one says also, الرَّجُلُ الرَّجُلَ ↓ عاجر, meaning<br>\
The man ran before the man, fleeing. (O, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  عَجَرَ, aor.<br>\
عَجِرَ, inf. n. عَجْرٌ, said of an ass, is<br>\
syn. with قَمَصَ [app. as meaning He raised his<br>\
fore legs together and put them down together,<br>\
and beat the ground with his kind legs]: (K,<br>\

عَجِرَ, inf. n. عَجْرٌ, (K,) He made an assault,<br>\

-b4-  عَجَرْتُ عَلَيْهِ, (Sh, O, K, *) aor.<br>\
عَجِرَ, inf. n. عَجْرٌ,<br>\
(K,) is also syn. with حَجَرْتُ عَلَيْهِ [meaning I<br>\
prohibited him from using, or disposing of, his<br>\
property according to his own free will]. (Sh, O,<br>\
K. *) ―<br>\
-b5-  And عَجْرٌ is also syn. with إِلْحَاحٌ; in<br>\
which sense, as in others, its aor. is said in the K<br>\
to be يَعْجِرُ; but this is not the case, for the verb<br>\
is used only in the pass. form: you say, عُجِرَ عَلَى<br>\
الرَّجُلِ, meaning The man was importuned for his<br>\
property, or was asked for it by many persons, so<br>\
that it became little. (TA.) One says رَجُلٌ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ ↓ مَعْجُورٌ meaning A man importuned by<br>\
begging so that all his property has been taken<br>\
from him. (K, * TA.)<br>\

اِعْتِجَارٌ is a mode of attiring peculiar to a<br>\

his head: (IF, S, Mgh, O, Msb:) and he wound<br>\
a turban (or a piece of cloth, TA) upon his head<br>\
without turning [a portion of] it beneath his lower<br>\
jaw; (Az, El-Ghooree, Mgh, K, * TA;) as also<br>\
اِقْتَعَطَ: the winding it in which manner [and so<br>\
wearing it] in prayer, is forbidden: but another<br>\
explanation, which is, he wound the turban upon his<br>\
head so as to show the هَامَة [or crown of the head],<br>\
is more probable; as it is from مِعْجَرٌ, meaning<br>\
“ a piece of a cloth, like a fillet, wound upon the<br>\
round of a woman&#39;s head. ” (Mgh.) One says,<br>\
↓ هُوَ حَسَنُ المُعْتَجَرِ He is comely in respect of the<br>\

and in like manner applied to a solid hoof, and<br>\

-b2-  And for another meaning of the first of the words, see أَعْجَرُ.<br>\
عُجْرَةٌ A place of projection, protrusion, prominence, or protuberance, and elevation. (A, *<br>\
K * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [A protuberance; a knob; a lump.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  A knot in wood, (S, Mgh, O, K,) and the<br>\
like, (K,) or in other things: (Mgh:) or in the<br>\

knotted vein in the belly,” particularly: (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
TA:) or the former, a thing that collects in the<br>\
body, like a ganglion (سِلْعَة); (As, O, TA;) and<br>\

revealed to him my vices, or faults, by reason of<br>\
my confidence in him: (A &#39;Obeyd, O, TA:) or<br>\

not concealing from him anything thereof. (As,<br>\
TA.) And أُحَدِّثُهُ بِعُجَرِى وَبُجَرِى (tropical:)  I relate to<br>\

the running string of the drawers. (A, TA.)<br>\
To this a poet likens the mark made by a blunt<br>\

السَّيْفٌ فِى فِرِنْدِهِ عُجَرٌ [The sword has, in its<br>\

عَجُورٌ [A species of melon: accord. to Forskål,<br>\
(Flora Aegypt. Arab., pp. lxxvi. and 168,) this<br>\
name and عبدلّاوى are both applied to the<br>\
cucumis chate: but accord. to Delile, (Floræ<br>\
Aegypt. Illustr., no. 922,) the latter name is<br>\
thus applied; and عجور (written by him as<br>\
though it were عَجُّور, but it is without teshdeed,)<br>\
is the name of the fruit of this species of cucumis<br>\
while immature; so too says &#39;Abd-El-Lateef: (see<br>\
De Sacy&#39;s Transl. and Notes, pp. 35 and 127;<br>\
and p. 54 of the Ar. Text edited by White:) I<br>\
have, however, found the name عَجُور to be commonly applied to a species different from the<br>\
عَبْدَلَّاوِىّ, (which is also called عَبْدَلِّىّ, see art.<br>\
عبد,) as Sonnini asserts it to be, (in his Travels<br>\
in Upper and Lower Egypt, pp. 574 and 636 of<br>\
the Engl. Transl., 4to., London, 1800,) and differing therefrom in shape, being, as he describes<br>\
it, in some instances round, in some instances oval,<br>\
and in others much elongated: the name is probably derived from the Greek<br>\
ἀγγούριον (in<br>\
modern Greek a&gt;ggouri), signifying the “ water-melon ”]: it is said in the Msb that قِثَّآء is a<br>\
name of what the [common] people call خِيَار and<br>\
عَجُور and فَقُّوس: but it is said [by some, not by<br>\
the author of the Msb,] that عَجُور signifies large<br>\
قِثَّآء [q. v.]. (TA in art. قثأ.)<br>\
أَعْجَرُ, applied to a man, (S, O,) Thick and<br>\
fat: (K:) big-bellied: (S, O, K:) a stallion big,<br>\

-b2-  Anything having knots:<br>\
(TA:) and so ↓ عَجِرٌ applied to a string, or<br>\
thread: (Ham p. 815:) and the former, knotty,<br>\
or having many knots. (TA.) [Hence,] عَجْرَآءُ<br>\
[for عَصًا عَجْرَآءُ] A staff, or stick, knotted, or<br>\
having knots. (A, O, K.) One says, ضَرَبَهُ<br>\
بِعَجْرَآءَ مِنْ سَلَمٍ [He beat him, or struck him,<br>\
with a knotted staff, or stick, of wood of the سَلَم].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is also applied to a sword [as<br>\
meaning Having, in its diversified wavy marks,<br>\
what resemble knots: see عُجْرَةٌ, and see also the<br>\
paragraph next following this]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also<br>\
Hump-backed. (Fr, O, TA.)<br>\
سَيْفٌ ذُو مَعْجَرٍ فِى مَتْنِهِ A sword having what<br>\
resemble knots [in the diversified wavy marks of<br>\
the broad side of its blade: see also the next<br>\
preceding paragraph]. (TA.)<br>\

(S, Msb, TA, in the O [erroneously] written<br>\
مِعْجَار,] A piece of cloth (Msb, K, TA) which<br>\
is bound upon the head, (K, TA,) smaller than<br>\
the رِدَآء, (Msb, TA,) and large than the مِقْنَعَة,<br>\
(TA,) worn by a woman: (Msb:) a thing which<br>\
a woman binds upon her head: (S:) a piece of<br>\
cloth, (Lth, Mgh, O, Msb, L,) like a fillet, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) which a woman winds upon the round of<br>\
her head, (Lth, Mgh, O, Msb, L,) after which<br>\
she puts on, over it, her [garment, or covering,<br>\
called] جِلْبَاب; (Lth, O, L:) [it is also said that]<br>\
مِعْجَرٌ signifies a turban: or a turban [wound]<br>\
upon the head without a turning [of a portion<br>\
thereof] beneath the jaw: (Ham p. 709:) its pl. is<br>\
مَعَاجِرُ: whence الاِعْتِجَارُ. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
مِعْجَرٌ signifies also A kind of garment, or cloth,<br>\
of the fabric of El-Yemen, (Lth, K, TA,) used<br>\
as the لِحَاف or مِلْحَفَة and the رِدَآء: pl. as above.<br>\

see مُجَرَّعٌ and مُحَرَّدٌ, with which it is syn.<br>\
مَعْجُورٌ عَلَيْهِ: see 1, last quarter.<br>\
مُعْتَجَرٌ: see 8, of which it is an inf. n.<br>\
مُعْتَجِرٌ is expl. as meaning A man wearing his<br>\
turban as a نِقَاب [q. v.], so that [a portion of] it<br>\
covers his nose [and the lower part of his face].<br>\
