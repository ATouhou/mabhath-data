عَشْرَقَ, said of a plant, or of herbage, and<br>\
[عَشْرَقَت] said of land, It became green. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
عِشْرِقٌ A certain plant, (S, K,) of the [kind<br>\
of plants called] أَغْلَاث, the grain of which is<br>\
good for the piles, and for generating milk, and<br>\
blackens the hair, (K,) or the leaves whereof,<br>\
which are like those of the عِظْلِم, intensely green,<br>\
blacken the hair when it is dressed therewith, and<br>\
cause it to grow: (TA:) n. un. with ة: (K:) Aboo-Ziyád says, it is of the [kind of plants called]<br>\
أَغْلَاث, and is a tree [or plant] that spreads upon<br>\
the ground, having thick [in the TA wide] leaves,<br>\
and not having thorns, and is scarcely, or never,<br>\
eaten by anything but the goats, which take some<br>\
little thereof, except its grain, for this is eaten:<br>\
some of the Arabs call it فَنًا; and when a grain<br>\
thereof falls upon the ground and dries, it becomes<br>\
red as though it were a bit of red wool: sometimes,<br>\
he says, the women use its leaves in combing and<br>\
dressing their hair, which it blackens, and causes<br>\
to grow: he says also, an Arab of the desert, of<br>\
Rabee&#39;ah, informed me that the عِشْرِقَة rises upon<br>\
a short stem, then spreads into many branches, and<br>\
bears numerous fruits, which are long, broad pods,<br>\
in every one of which pods are two rows of grains<br>\
exactly like the stones of raisins, and these are<br>\
eaten while fresh, and are cooked, and are pleasant in taste; and when the wind blows, those<br>\
pods become in a state of commotion, being suspended by slender stalks, so that they make a<br>\
rustling sound, and you hear, in the valley in<br>\
which they are found, a low and confused sound,<br>\
which frightens the camels; and the serpents do<br>\
not make their abode in that valley, fleeing from<br>\
the sound: its leaves are like those of the عِظْلِم,<br>\
intensely green; and its grain is white, pleasant<br>\
to the taste, easily broken, unctuous, and hot;<br>\
good for the piles: Aboo-Ziyád also says that<br>\
the عِشْرِق and سَنًا [i. e. senna] are like each other,<br>\
except that the leaves of the latter are thin; also,<br>\
that an Arab of the desert, of the Benoo-Asad,<br>\
told him that the blossom of the عِشْرِق inclines to<br>\
whiteness; and that the places of its growth were<br>\
said by some to be the rugged tracts: (O:) Az<br>\
says that it is a herb of which the leaves and produce are like those of the غَار [or bay], except in<br>\
being larger: IAar, that it is a red plant, of sweet<br>\
odour, used by the brides: and IB, from As, that<br>\
it is a cubit in height, having small grains, and,<br>\
when dry, producing a sound by reason of the passage of the wind: (TA:) [Forskål (in his Flora<br>\
Aegypt. Arab. pp. cxi. and 86) mentions it as a<br>\
species of cassia:] عَشَارِقُ is pl. of عِشْرِقَةٌ, or of the<br>\
gen. n. عِشْرِقٌ. (TA.)<br>\
