عَالَ عِيَالَهُ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, * K, TA,) aor.<br>\
يَعُولُ, (S, O, Msb,) inf. n. عَوْلٌ (S, O, Msb, K)<br>\
and عِيَالَةٌ (S, O, K) and عُوُولٌ; (K;) He fed,<br>\
nourished, or sustained, his family, or household,<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, * K, [in the Msb, اليَتِيمَ, the<br>\
orphan,]) and expended upon them: (S, Mgh, O:)<br>\
or he supplied them with what they needed of food<br>\
and clothing and other things: (TA:) and ↓ أَعَالَهُمْ<br>\
and ↓ عَيَّلَهُمْ signify the same. (K.) One says, عُلْتُهُ<br>\
شَهْرًا I supplied him with his means of subsistence<br>\
for a month. (S, O.) And it is said in a trad.,<br>\
اِبْدَأْ بِمَنْ تَعُولُ i. e. [Begin thou] with those<br>\
whom thou sustainest, and whose expenses are incumbent on thee; and if anything remain over<br>\
and above, let it be for the strangers, or those<br>\
who are not related to thee. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And عال,<br>\
(Ks, K, TA,) aor. as above, (Ks, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
عَوْلٌ and عِيَالَةٌ (K, TA) and عُوُولٌ, (TA,) He had<br>\
a numerous family or household; (K, TA;) [and]<br>\
so ↓ اعال, (Z, Mgh, O, Msb,) and ↓ أَعْوَلَ, (Z, O,<br>\
K,) and ↓ أَعْيَلَ, (Msb, K, TA,) this last formed<br>\
by the change of و into ى, (TA,) [or formed<br>\
from عِيَالٌ,] and عيل [i. e. ↓ عَيَّلَ]: (Msb:) ↓ اعال<br>\
is also expl. as meaning [simply] he had a family,<br>\
or household: and ↓ أَعْوَلَتْ, occurring in a trad.,<br>\
as meaning she brought forth children, is said by<br>\
IAth to be originally أَعْيَلَتْ, signifying she had<br>\
a family, or household; but Z says that اعيلت<br>\
is formed with a regard to the word عِيَالٌ, and<br>\
is not the original form. (TA.) [See also 4 in<br>\
art. عيل.] مَا لَهُ عَالَ وَمَالَ is a form of imprecation, meaning [What ails him?] May he have a<br>\
numerous family or household, and may he decline<br>\
from the right course in his judgment. (K. [See<br>\
another explanation in art. عيل.]) And the saying, in the Kur [iv. 3], ذٰلِكَ أَدْنَى أَلَّا تَعُولُوا has<br>\
been expl. as meaning [That will be more, or<br>\
most, apt, fit, or proper,] that ye may not<br>\
have numerous families or households. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence, probably,] عال, aor. as above, [and يَعِيلُ,<br>\
(see 1 in art. عيل,)] signifies also He (a man)<br>\
was, or became, poor; (Ks, TA;) [and] so<br>\
↓ اعال. (K.) And Yoo says that لَا يَعُولُ عَلَى<br>\
القَصْدِ أَحَدٌ signifies لَا يَحْتَاجُ [app. meaning No<br>\
one will become poor, or in want, while following<br>\
the right course]: (TA:) and so لَا يَعِيلُ. (TA<br>\
in art. عيل.)<br>\
-A3-  عال المِيزَانُ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) aor. يَعُولُ and يَعِيلُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. عَوْلٌ<br>\
and عَيْلٌ, (TA,) The balance inclined, or declined,<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb,) and rose: (Mgh, Msb:) or<br>\
one of its extremities rose above the other: (TA:)<br>\
or it was, or became, defective, and declined from<br>\
the right state: or [in the CK “ and ”] it was, or<br>\
became, excessive. (K, TA.) And [hence,] عال<br>\
فِى المِيزَانِ (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, unfaithful; or<br>\
he acted unfaithfully. (Msb.) A poet says,<br>\
قَالُوا اتَّبْعْنَا رَسُولَ اللّٰهِ وَاطَّرَحُوا<br>\
قَوْلَ الرَّسُولِ وَعَالُوا فِى المَوَازِينِ<br>\
[They said, “We have followed the way of the<br>\
Apostle of God: ” but they have rejected the saying of the Apostle, (assumed tropical:)  and been false in the balances,<br>\
i. e., unfaithful]. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عال, (inf. n.<br>\
عَوْلٌ, Msb,) He (a judge, Mgh) deviated from<br>\
the right course, or acted wrongfully, (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) فِى الحُكْمِ [in the judgment]. (S, O.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [iv. 3, mentioned above], أَلَّا<br>\
تَعُولُوا [that ye may not deviate from the right<br>\
course], (S, Mgh, O, Msb, TA,) accord. to Mujá-<br>\
hid, (S, O, Msb,) and most of the expositors.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, (S, Mgh, O,) in the opinion<br>\
of A&#39;Obeyd, (S, O,) عَالَتِ الفَرِيضَةُ, (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) aor. تَعُولُ, (TA,) inf. n. عَوْلٌ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
O, Msb,) The فَرِيضَة [or primarily-apportioned<br>\
inheritance] deviated [by excess] from the limit of<br>\
the named [primary] portions [which are all fractions of four and twenty]; (Bd in iv. 3;) [meaning] it rose [above], (S, O, Msb, K,) or exceeded,<br>\
(K,) in the reckoning, (Msb, K,) [the regular<br>\
sum of the fixed primary portions,] i. e., its [fixed<br>\
primary], portions exceeded [the regular sum<br>\
thereof], occasioning a diminution to the sharers:<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb:) العَوْلُ in this case being the<br>\
contr. of الرَّدُّ [which I do not find in any lexicon,<br>\
but only in dictionaries of conventional terms].<br>\
(Msb.) Az relates, of El-Mufaddal, that, application having been made to him respecting [the<br>\
shares of inheritance of] two daughters and a<br>\
father and a mother and a wife, said, “Her [the<br>\
wife&#39;s] eighth has become a ninth: ” and A&#39; Obeyd<br>\
says, he meant that the [primary] portions had<br>\
exceeded [the regular sum] so that there fell to<br>\
the wife the ninth, whereas in the original case<br>\
she would have had the eighth; for if the فريضة<br>\
had not exceeded [the regular sum], it would<br>\
have consisted of four and twenty; but when it<br>\
[so] exceeded, it became of seven and twenty;<br>\
and there pertained to the two daughters the two<br>\
thirds [of four and twenty], i. e. sixteen portions;<br>\
and to the father and the mother the two sixths,<br>\
i. e. eight portions; and to the wife three reckoned<br>\
as of seven and twenty, i. e. the ninth, whereas,<br>\
before the exceeding, it would have been three<br>\
of four and twenty, i. e. the eighth: and this<br>\
question is called المَسْأَلَةُ المِنْبَرِيَّةُ, because &#39;Alee<br>\
was asked respecting it when he was on the<br>\
pulpit, and said, without premeditation, “Her<br>\
eighth has become a ninth. ” (TA.) Hence the<br>\
saying, in a trad. of Maryam, [i. e. the Virgin<br>\
Mary, respecting a story to which allusion is<br>\
made in the Kur iii. 39, (see a note on that verse<br>\
in Sale&#39;s Translation,)] وَعَالَ قَلَمُ زَكَرِيَّآءَ i. e. [And<br>\
the divining-arrow of Zacharias] rose upon the<br>\
water. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And one says also, عال زَيْدٌ<br>\
الفَرَائِضَ, (S, Mgh, O,) or الفَرِيضَةَ, (Msb,) first<br>\
pers. عُلْتُهَا, (K,) meaning Zeyd made the فرائض,<br>\
or فريضة, to be as described above; as also ↓ أَعَالَهَا;<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K; *) which latter is the more<br>\
common. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  عال said of an affair, or<br>\
event, It was, or became, hard to be borne, severe,<br>\
or distressing, and great, or formidable. (S, O,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And also, (S, O, K,) aor. يَعُولُ, (S. O,)<br>\
inf. n. عَوْلٌ, (TA,) It (a thing) overcame a person;<br>\
burdened, or oppressed, him; (S, O, K;) distressed<br>\
him; (Fr, O;) and disquieted him, or rendered<br>\
him anxious. (K.) [See an ex. in a verse cited<br>\
voce مَسَافَةٌ, in art. سوف.] One says, عِيلَ مَا هُوَ<br>\
عَائِلُهُ i. e. غُلِبَ مَا هُوَ غَالِبُهُ [May he be overcome!<br>\
Of what is he the overcomer?]: (S, Meyd, O, K:)<br>\
a prov., (Meyd,) applied to him at whose speech,<br>\
or some other thing proceeding from him, (S,<br>\
Meyd, O, K,) of a like sort, (K,) one wonders:<br>\
(S, Meyd, O, K:) it is of the nature of a prayer,<br>\
(S, Meyd, O,) for the man; (Meyd;) like the<br>\
saying, when a thing pleases one, قَاتَلَهُ اللّٰهُ, and<br>\
أَخْزَاهُ اللّٰهُ. (TA.) And عِيلَ صَبْرِى My patience<br>\
was overcome; (S, O, K;) and so عَالَ صَبْرِى:<br>\
(Abu-l-Jarráh, Lh, K:) or, accord. to Aboo-<br>\
Tálib, the former may mean رُفِعَ [i. e., was taken<br>\
away, lit. raised; and if so, the latter may in<br>\
like manner mean اِرْتَفَعَ]. (TA.) عَالَتِ البَيْقُورَ,<br>\
occurring in a verse of Umeiyeh Ibn-Abi-s-Salt,<br>\
refers to a year of drought, and means It oppressed<br>\
the [wild] oxen, by occasioning their having سَلَع<br>\
and عُشَر tied to their tails and set on fire, and<br>\
being made to ascend upon the mountain; by<br>\
the doing of which, the Arabs asserted that they<br>\
obtained rain. (S, O. [See art. سلع.]) ―<br>\
-b7-  عَالَكَ<br>\
عَالِيًا [in which عَالَكَ app. signifies properly رَفَعَكَ,<br>\
the agent (اللّٰهُ) being understood,] is like the saying لَعًا لَكَ عَالِيًا, (K, TA, [in the CK لَعا لَكَ,]) and<br>\
is expl. in the T as meaning Mayest thou rise, or<br>\
be raised, after stumbling, or falling. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
عِيلَ عَوْلُهُ [app. signifying lit. May the wailing for<br>\
him be raised (in the CK عَوْلَةً)] means may his<br>\
mother be bereft of him; as also عَالَ عَوْلُهُ. (K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
عَيَّلَهُمْ [app. formed from عِيَالٌ, in which the<br>\
ى is originally و]: see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  It<br>\
signifies also He made them to become what are<br>\
termed عِيَال [i. e. a family, or household]: or he<br>\
neglected them: (K:) or تَعْيِيلٌ signifies the feeding badly. (S and O in art. عيل.)<br>\
-A2-  عيّل as intrans.: see 1, fourth sentence.<br>\
-A3-  عوّل عَلَيْهِ He<br>\
acted, or behaved, with boldness, or presumptuousness, towards him; or confided in his love, and<br>\
therefore acted presumptuously towards him; and<br>\
he put, or imposed as a burden, upon him [some<br>\
affair]; (AZ, S, O, K;) as also عَلَيْهِ ↓ أَعْوَلَ, (K,<br>\
TA,) part. n. ↓ مُعْوِلٌ. (TA.) One says, عَوَّلْتُ,<br>\
عَلَى فُلَانٍ I put, or imposed as a burden, upon<br>\
such a one, somewhat of my affair: and عَوِّلْ عَلَىَّ<br>\
Put thou, or impose thou as a burden, upon me<br>\
what thou desirest. (Ham p. 125.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He<br>\
asked aid of him; (K, TA;) as also عوّل بِهِ.<br>\
(TA.) One says, عَوِّلٌ عَلَىَّ بِما شِئْتَ Ask thou<br>\
aid of me in what thou wilt; as though he said,<br>\
put thou, or impose thou as a burden, upon me,<br>\
what thou likest. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He relied upon<br>\
it, or confided in it; (Msb, K;) namely, a thing;<br>\
as also عوّل بِهِ; inf. n. تَعْوِيلٌ (Msb) and ↓ مُعَوَّلٌ,<br>\
(K, TA,) thus on the authority of Th, who thus<br>\
explains it in the saying, (TA,) of Imra-el-<br>\
Keys, (O,)<br>\
وَإنَّ شِفَائِى عَبْرَةٌ مُهَرَقَةٌ<br>\
فَهَلْ عِنْدَ رَسْمٍ دَارِسٍ مِنْ مُعَوَّلِ<br>\
[When verily my cure is a flow of tears poured<br>\
forth: but is there reliance, or confidence, to be<br>\
felt at the remains of an abode becoming rased, or<br>\
effaced?]: or ↓ مُعَوَّل is here an inf. n. of عَوَّلْتُ in<br>\
the sense of أعْوَلْتُ, i. e. بَكَيْتُ; so that the meaning is, weeping: (TA:) or it here means a place<br>\
of weeping: or, as some say, a seeking of any<br>\
means of profiting. (O. [See also EM pp. 6<br>\
and 7.]) One says likewise, ↓ عَلَيْهِ المُعَوَّلُ, meaning [Upon him is placed] reliance. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-<br>\
See also 4.<br>\
-A5-  And عوّل, (K, and Ham p. 125,)<br>\
or عوّل عَالَةً, (S, O,) inf. n. تَعْوِيلٌ, (K,) signifies<br>\
He (a pastor, Ham) made, or constructed, a<br>\
shelter from the rain, termed عالة, (S, O, K, and<br>\
Ham * ubi suprà,) by binding some branches of a<br>\
tree to some branches of a tree near to the former,<br>\
and then covering them with small lopped wood<br>\
such as is used for firewood. (Ham.)<br>\
4<br>\
أعَالَهُمْ: see 1, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-  اعال and<br>\
أعْوَلَ and أَعْيَلَ as intrans.: see 1, former half, in<br>\
six places.<br>\
-A3-  اعال الفَرَئِضَ or الفَرِيضَةَ: see 1,<br>\
latter half.<br>\
-A4-  See also 2, former half.<br>\
-A5-  أَعْوَلَ<br>\
(Sh, S, O, K) and ↓ عوّل (Sh, O, K) He wept;<br>\

i. e. raised his voice with weeping, (S, K,) and<br>\
cried out; (K;) or wept, and cried out; عَلَيْهِ for<br>\
him: (Sh, O, Msb:) and an instance occurs, in<br>\
a verse of &#39;Obeyd-Allah Ibn-&#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-&#39;Otbeh, cited by Th, of اعول trans. by itself, عَلَى<br>\
being suppressed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says<br>\
also, أَعْوَلَتِ القَوْسُ (assumed tropical:)  The bow produced a sound:<br>\
(S, M, O, K, TA:) in some lexicons, as in the<br>\
L, erroneously, الفَرَسُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A6-  And اعال and<br>\
أَعْوَلَ (AZ, O, K, and S in art. مُعْوِلٌ) and مُعْيِلٌ<br>\
(K) signify He (a man, K) desired vehemently,<br>\
eagerly, greedily, very greedily, or with avidity;<br>\
or did so excessively, or culpably; or coveted;<br>\
(AZ, S, O, K;) part. ns. ↓ مُعْوِلٌ and ↓ مُعْيِلٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِعْتَوَلَ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
عَالٌ a word occurring in the saying مَا لَهُ عَالٌ<br>\
وَلَا مَالٌ, which means He has not anything belonging to him. (K.)<br>\
عَوْلٌ: see عَوِيلٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  عَوْلَ is a word like وَيْبَ:<br>\
one says, عَوْلَكَ and عَوْلَ زَيْدٍ [i. e. May God<br>\
decree thy woe and the woe of Zeyd, virtually<br>\
meaning woe to thee and woe to Zeyd]: (S, O,<br>\
K:) and عَوْلٌ لِزَيْدٍ [lit. meaning Woe to Zeyd]:<br>\
(S, O:) or, accord. to Sb and others, عَوْلَ is used<br>\
only as a sequent to وَيْلَ; they said وَيْلَهُ وَعَوْلَهُ;<br>\
in which, Az says, ويل and عول both signify<br>\
weeping, or lamentation with tears; and Aboo-<br>\
Tálib says that they are put in the accus. case as<br>\
expressive of an imprecation and of blame, like as<br>\
is done in the sayings وَيْلًا لَهُ and تُرَابًا لَهُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Any affair, or event, that renders one<br>\
anxious: (K, * TA:) app. an inf. n. used thus as<br>\
a subst. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And One whose aid is asked<br>\
(K, TA) in affairs of difficulty or importance.<br>\
(TA. [See also مُعَوَّلٌ.])<br>\
-A4-  And The food of a<br>\
family or household. (K.)<br>\
عَوَلٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
عِوَلٌ is [said to be] a subst. signifying Reliance,<br>\
and confidence: (S, * K, TA:) and [it is said that]<br>\
هُوَ عِوَلِى signifies He is my stay, or support: the<br>\
word, however, occurs in this form, twice, in a<br>\
verse of Taäbata-sharrà, accord. to the relation<br>\
thereof by Aboo-&#39;Ikrimeh; but accord. to others<br>\
it is ↓ عَوَلٌ, with fet-h to the ع and و, and is said<br>\
to be an inf. n.; whereas the former is said to be<br>\
pl. of ↓ عَوْلَةٌ; [and the two words signify, respectively, a weeping and weepings; for] by his saying<br>\
لٰكِنَّمَا عَِوَلِى إِنْ عَِوَلٍ<br>\
the poet means If I wept for any one, I would<br>\
weep &amp;c. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عِوَلٌ is also a subst. signifying An asking for aid. (K, TA.)<br>\
عَالَةٌ A ظُلَّة [or covering], (K,) or a thing like a<br>\
ظُلَّة, (S, O,) used as a shelter from the rain, (S,<br>\
O, K,) constructed with cuttings of trees [in a<br>\
manner described above: see 2, last sentence].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. نَعَامَةٌ, (Kr, K,) either as<br>\
meaning The species of animal thus called [i. e.<br>\
an ostrich], or as meaning a ظُلَّة, for thus نَعَامَةٌ<br>\
also signifies. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [As a pl.: see عِيَالٌ.]<br>\
-A3-  See also art. عيل.<br>\
عَوْلَةٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places:<br>\
and see also عِوَلٌ.<br>\
عَوِيلٌ A wailing; i. e. a raising of the voice<br>\
with weeping; as also ↓ عَوْلٌ and ↓ عَوْلَةٌ: (S, O,<br>\
K:) or a weeping and crying out: (Msb:) and<br>\
sometimes it signifies a cry, or voice, from the<br>\
chest, without weeping: (O, TA:) and sometimes<br>\
↓ عَوْلَةٌ signifies the burning sensation of grief and<br>\
of love, without a raising of the voice and without<br>\
weeping. (TA.) [See also عَوَّالٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  Also Weak:<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  and hence it is used as a name for One of the<br>\
ropes of a ship or boat. (TA.)<br>\
عِيَالٌ, belonging to this art. and to art. عيل;<br>\
(K, mentioned in the S and O in the latter art.;)<br>\
or its ى is substituted for و, for it is from عَالَ,<br>\
aor. يَعُولُ, in the first of the senses expl. above,<br>\
and seems to be an inf. n. used in the sense of a<br>\
pass. part. n.; (IB, TA;) [and if so, it may be<br>\
used as a sing. (as it is in the Ksh and by Bd in<br>\
xvi. 78 and in the S and Mgh &amp;c. voce كَلٌّ and<br>\
in the O and K voce حَمِيلَةٌ) and also as a pl.;<br>\
but in general] it signifies A family, or household; (Msb;) [i. e.,] a man&#39;s عِيَال are the persons<br>\
whom he feeds, nourishes, or sustains; (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K;) or the persons who dwell with him, and whose<br>\
expenses are incumbent on him, as his young man,<br>\
or slave, his wife, and his young child: (KT:)<br>\
and ↓ عَيِّلٌ signifies the same: (K:) or this latter<br>\
(which is originally عَيْوِلٌ, TA) is sing. of عِيَالٌ<br>\
x(S, Mgh, O, Msb) and of عَيَائِلُ, (S, O,) like as<br>\
جَيِّدٌ is sing. of جِيَادٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb) and of<br>\
جَيَائِدُ; (S, O;) the last being a pl. pl., (K in art.<br>\
عيل,) [as also عِيَالَاتٌ, of which see an ex. voce<br>\
أزْمَلٌ;] but is sometimes used as a pl., for عَشَرَةُ<br>\
عَيِّلٍ, accord. to an ex. in a trad., signifies ten<br>\
persons fed, nourished, or sustained, by a man:<br>\
(TA:) or the pl. [of ↓ عَيِّلٌ] is عَالَةٌ, (Kr, K,)<br>\
[like as سَادَةٌ is said to be pl. of سَيِّدٌ,] or, accord.<br>\
to ISd, it is pl. of عَائِلٌ, [q. v. in art. عيل, and in<br>\
like manner سَادَةٌ is held by him to be pl. of سَائِدٌ,<br>\
not of سَيِّدٌ,] for [he says that] a word of the<br>\
measure فَيْعِلٌ never forms a pl. [like عَالَةٌ, which<br>\
is] of the measure فَعَلَةٌ; (TA;) and [عَيَائِلُ is<br>\
applied to women, for] one says نِسْوَةٌ عَيَائِلُ. (K.)<br>\
العِيَالُ [as meaning (assumed tropical:)  The dependants for sustenance] is also used, metaphorically, in relation to<br>\
birds, and to predaceous and other beasts. (TA.)<br>\
And أُمُّ العِيَالِ is a name for (assumed tropical:)  The cooking-pot.<br>\
(T in art. ام.)<br>\
عَوَالَةٌ Want: and intrusion at feasts, uninvited.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عَوَّالٌ A weeping: an inf. n. [or rather a quasiinf. n.] of عَوَّلَ: pl. عَوَاوِيلُ, and by poetic license<br>\
عَوَاوِلُ. (TA.) [See also عَوِيلٌ.]<br>\
عَائِلٌ [act. part. n. of عَالَ]. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says أَمْرٌ<br>\
عَائِلٌ and عَالٍ, the latter being formed by transposition, meaning [An affair, or event,] hard to<br>\
be borne, severe, or distressing, and great, or formidable. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عَائِلٌ applied to a measure of<br>\
capacity means Exceeding others. (IAar, TA in<br>\
art. عيل.)<br>\
عَيِّلٌ: see عِيَالٌ, in two places.<br>\
أَعْوَلُ i. q. أَشَدُّ [More, and most, hard to be<br>\
borne, &amp;c.]: and أَعْلَى, occurring in a verse of<br>\
Aboo-Dhu-eyb, signifies the same, being formed<br>\
from أَعْوَلُ by transposition. (TA.)<br>\
مَعُولٌ [Fed, nourished, or sustained: &amp;c.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
And] Overcome: applied in this sense to patience:<br>\
(K:) and to a man, in respect of his opinion, or<br>\
judgment. (TA.)<br>\
مُعْوَلٌ, followed by عَلَيْهِ, Wailed for: thus in<br>\
the trad., المُعْوَلُ عَلَيْهِ يُعَذَّبُ, (S, O,) or, as some<br>\
relate it, ↓ المُعَوَّلُ; i. e. He (of the dead) who is<br>\
wailed for will be punished. (O.)<br>\
مُعْوِلٌ: see 2:<br>\
-A2-  and see also 4, last sentence.<br>\
مِعْوَلٌ [A pickaxe, or stone-cutter&#39;s pick; (so in<br>\
the present day;)] the iron implement, (K,) a<br>\
large فَأْس, (S, O, Msb,) with which are pecked,<br>\
or hollowed out, (S, O, K,) rocks, or great masses<br>\
of stone, (S, O,) or mountains: (K:) pl. مَعَاوِلُ.<br>\
