عَطْرِدْهُ لَنَا Make thou it to be to us, (O,<br>\
K,) with thee, or in thy estimation, (O,) like the<br>\
promise, (كَالعِدَةِ, K, TA, inf. n. of وَعَدَ, and<br>\
this is the only explanation given by the leading<br>\
authorities on strange words, TA, [in the O,<br>\
كَالعِدَّةِ,]) or like the apparatus that is prepared<br>\
for the casualties of fortune; (كَالعُدَّةِ and العَتَادِ;<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K;) and ↓ اِجْعَلْهُ لَنَا عُطْرُودًا signifies the same. (O, K.)<br>\
عَطَرَّدٌ i. q. عَطَوَّدٌ in its several meanings: (K:)<br>\
signifying High, applied to a mountain: ―<br>\
-b2-  and<br>\
Tall, applied to a man or camel: (L:) ―<br>\
-b3-  and<br>\
Long, applied to a day; and to a limit, term,<br>\
reach, or goal, or to a heat, or single run to a<br>\
goal or limit; (S, O, L;) and to a road: (L:)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  and Generous, noble, or liberal, applied to a<br>\
man: (O:) ―<br>\
-b5-  and Quick, applied to a pace, or<br>\
rate of going: (L:) ―<br>\
-b6-  and Sharpened, applied<br>\
to a spear-head. (O.)<br>\
اِجْعَلْهُ لَنَا عُطْرُودًا: see the first paragraph.<br>\
عُطَارِدٌ or عُطَارِدُ, (accord. to different copies of<br>\
the S,) or both, being perfectly and imperfectly<br>\
decl., (K,) but what is the cause of its being imperfectly decl., with the quality of a proper name,<br>\
requires consideration, (MF,) [The planet Mercury;] the star of the scribes; (Az, TA:) one of<br>\
the stars called الخُنَّسُ; (S, O, K:) accord. to<br>\
the K [and O], in the sixth heaven [or sphere]:<br>\
but the sheykh &#39;Alee El-Makdisee says that this<br>\
is a mistake, for it is well known to be in one<br>\
second. (TA.)<br>\
