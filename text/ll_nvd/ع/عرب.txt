and the verb implies that, by this operation, what<br>\

عَرُبَ, inf. n. عُرْبٌ and عُرُوبٌ,<br>\

TA:) and ↓ عَرُبَ he spoke without incorrectness;<br>\
(Msb;) and [so اعرب, for] إِعْرَابٌ signifies the<br>\
committing no error in speech: (K, TA:) and<br>\
the expressing of meanings clearly, plainly, distinctly, or perspicuously, by words. (TA.) [↓ عرّب,<br>\
also, has a similar meaning:] it is said in a trad.,<br>\

or perspicuous. (TA.) And اعرب بِحُجَّتِهِ He<br>\
declared, or spoke out clearly or plainly, his argument, plea, allegation, or the like, without fearing<br>\
any one. (S, O.) And أَعْرَبْتُ الشَّىْءَ and اعربت<br>\
عَنْهُ, and ↓ عَرَّبْتُهُ and عرّبت عَنْهُ, which last, accord. to Fr, is better than عرّبتهُ and اعربتهُ, I<br>\
made the thing clear, plain, distinct, or manifest.<br>\
(Msb.) And اعرب عَمَّا فِى ضَمِيرِهِ He declared,<br>\
or spoke out clearly or plainly, what was in his<br>\

what is in his heart. (Az, TA.) It is said in a<br>\
trad., الثَّيِّبُ تُعْرِبُ عَنْ نَفْسِهَا, (S,) or الأَيِّمُ, and<br>\
↓ تُعَرِّبُ, accord. to different relaters, but some<br>\
say the former only, (Msb,) i. e. [She who has<br>\
become a widow, or been divorced, &amp;c., or she who<br>\
has no husband, whether she be a virgin or not, or<br>\
not being a virgin,] shall speak out plainly for<br>\
herself [when demanded in marriage]: (S, Msb:)<br>\
or الثَّيِّبُ يُعْرِبُ عَنْهَا لِسَانُهَا, so accord. to IKt, (O,)<br>\
or عنها ↓ يُعَرِّبُ, (Mgh, O,) so accord. to A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
but, as IAmb says, both are dial. vars. of which<br>\
neither is preferable to the other; and the meaning is [she who has become a widow, &amp;c., her<br>\
tongue] shall declare for her. (O.) One says<br>\
also, اعرب عَنِ الرَّجُلِ He spoke out, or explained,<br>\
for the man. (TA.) And عَنِ القَوْمِ ↓ عَرَّبْتُ I<br>\
spoke for the people, or party; (Fr, S, Mgh, * O,<br>\
K;) and pleaded for them; (Fr, Mgh, * TA;)<br>\
as also أَعْرَبْتُ; but the former in this sense is<br>\
better known. (Mgh.) And اعرب عَنْهُ, and<br>\
عنه ↓ عرّب, He pleaded his cause. (TA.) And<br>\
عَنْ حَاجَتِهِ ↓ عرّب He spoke and pleaded for the<br>\
object of his want. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اعرب also signifies<br>\
He was, or became, chaste, uncorrupt, or free<br>\
from barbarousness, in speech; although not an<br>\
Arab. (Msb.) And لَهُ الكَلَامَ ↓ عَرَّبْتُ, inf. n.<br>\
تَعْرِيبٌ; as also أَعْرَبْتُ له, inf. n. إِعْرَابٌ; I made<br>\
the speech [that I spoke] clear, or plain, to him,<br>\
so that there was in it no barbarousness. (TA.)<br>\
And مَنْطِقَهُ ↓ عرّب, (S, O,) inf. n. تَعْرِيبٌ, (K,)<br>\
He made his speech free from error, or incorrectness. (S, O, K.) And أَعْرَبْتُ الحَرْفَ I made the<br>\
حرف [i. e. word] clear, or plain: or the ا in this<br>\
case denotes privation, and the meaning is (assumed tropical:)  I<br>\
removed its عرب, [app. ↓ عَرَب, from this word as<br>\
inf. n. of عَرِبَ used in relation to the stomach &amp;c.,]<br>\
i. e. vagueness. (Msb.) And اعرب كَلَامَهُ He<br>\
made his speech free from error, or incorrectness,<br>\
in [what is termed] الإِعْرَاب [here meaning what<br>\
grammarians generally intend thereby, namely,<br>\
desinential syntax, or the science of the various<br>\
inflections of words, literal or virtual, by reason<br>\
of the various governing words]. (S, O.) [اعرب<br>\
is also used by grammarians as meaning He declined a word; and أُعْرِبَ as meaning It was<br>\
declined, or declinable; in these senses opposed<br>\
to بَنَى and بُنِىَ, inf. n. بِنَآءٌ: and the former also<br>\
as meaning He analyzed grammatically, or<br>\
parsed, a sentence: and the inf. n. of the verb<br>\
(act. and pass.) in these senses is إِعْرَابٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
See also 2, first sentence: ―<br>\
-b4-  and again in the<br>\
first third part of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b5-  إِعْرَابٌ also<br>\
signifies The making [a person] to revert from,<br>\
or relinquish, foul speech; (K, TA;) and so<br>\
↓ تَعْرِيبٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And The speaking foul, or<br>\
obscene, language; as also ↓ تَعْرِيبٌ, and ↓ اِسْتِعْرَابٌ:<br>\
(O, K:) thus it bears two contr. significations.<br>\
(K, TA.) One says of a man, اعرب [&amp;c.], (S,<br>\
O,) or اعرب فِى كَلَامِهِ, (Msb,) He spoke foul,<br>\
or obscene, language. (S, O, Msb.) [Golius and<br>\
Freytag have assigned this meaning to ↓ تعرّب<br>\
also: the latter of them as from the S and K;<br>\
in neither of which do I find it.] ―<br>\
-b7-  And The<br>\
act of copulating: or the speaking of that act in<br>\
an oblique, or indirect, manner. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  And<br>\

race from one of mean race by his neighing. (K.)<br>\

of pure Arabian race, free from any admixture<br>\
of other than Arabian blood: (K, TA:) [or his<br>\
making himself to be known as such by his neighing; for] اعرب means he (a horse) neighed, and<br>\
was consequently known to be of Arabian race.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And The making a horse to run. (K.)<br>\
Accord. to Fr, one says, اعرب عَلَى فَرَسِهِ, meaning<br>\
He made his horse to run: but he adds that some<br>\
say اغرب. (O.)<br>\
-A3-  And إِعْرَابٌ signifies The<br>\
taking as one&#39;s wife a woman such as is termed<br>\
عَرُوبٌ [q. v.]. (K.)<br>\

The people&#39;s watering [of their camels], having<br>\

(S.) He (a man not of genuine Arabian descent)<br>\

(Az, TA.) Hence, تعرّب بَعْدَ هِجْرَتِهِ He became<br>\
an Arab of the desert [after his flight, or emigration, for the sake of El-Islám], (S, Mgh,) returning to the desert. (Mgh.) ―<br>\

-b3-  And syn. with<br>\
عَرَبٌ as [inf. n. of عَرِبَ, and] meaning نَشَاطٌ [i. e.<br>\
Briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness]. (O, K.)<br>\
العُرْبُ: see العَرَبُ, first sentence.<br>\
عِرْبٌ Such as is dried up, of the [species of<br>\
barley-grass called] بُهْمَى: (S, O, K:) or of any<br>\
herb, or leguminous plant: n. un. with ة: or<br>\
عِرْبُ البُهْمَى signifies the prickles of the بُهْمَى.<br>\

nation; [the Arabs, or Arabians;] (S, O;) the<br>\
contr. of العَجَمُ (A, Msb, K, TA) and العُجْمُ;<br>\

towns, (S, A, O, K,) or of the Arabian cities<br>\
and towns or villages: (Mgh:) [but now, on the<br>\
contrary, generally applied to those who dwell in<br>\
the desert:] or those who have alighted and made<br>\
their abode in the cultivated regions, and have<br>\
taken as their homes the Arabian cities and<br>\
towns or villages, and others also that are related<br>\
to them: (Az, Msb:) or [accord. to general<br>\
usage] an appellation of common application [to<br>\
the whole nation]: (T, K:) [and in the lexicons<br>\
and lexicological works applied to the desert<br>\
Arabs of pure speech:] it is of the fem. gender:<br>\
(Msb, K:) and العَرَبُ has two pls., namely,<br>\
العُرُبُ, with two dammehs, and الأَعْرُبُ [which is<br>\
a pl. of pauc.]: (Msb:) the rel. n. [which serves<br>\
as a sing.] is ↓ عَرَبِىٌّ: (S, O, K: [عَرَبٌ عَرَبِىٌّ in<br>\
the CK is a mistake:]) accord. to Az, (TA,)<br>\
this appellation is applied to a man of established<br>\
Arab lineage, even if he be not chaste, or correct,<br>\
in speech. (Msb, TA.) The dim. of العَرَبُ is<br>\
↓ العُرَيْبُ, (S, O,) without ة, (O, TA,) an extr.<br>\
word [with respect to analogy, as the undiminished<br>\
noun is fem.]: (TA:) a poet (Abu-l-Hindee,<br>\
whose name was &#39;Abd-El-Mu-min, son of &#39;AbdEl-Kuddoos, O, TA) says,<br>\
وَمَكْنُ الضِّبَابِ طَعَامُ العُرَيْبِ<br>\
وَلَا تَشْتَهِيهِ نُفُوسُ العَجَمْ<br>\
[And the eggs of dabbs are food of the little<br>\
Arabs; but the souls of the Foreigners do not<br>\
desire them]: in which he uses the dim. form to<br>\
imply respect, or honour, like as it is used in the<br>\
saying أَنَا جُذَيْلُهَا المُحَكَّكُ وَعُذَيْقُهَا المُرَجَّبُ [expl.<br>\
in art. جذل]. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ↓ العَرَبُ العَارِبَةُ (in which<br>\
the latter word is used as a corroborative of the<br>\
former as in لَيْلٌ لَائِلٌ, S, O) and ↓ العَرَبُ العَرْبَآءُ<br>\
(S, A, O, Msb, K) and ↓ العَرَبُ العَرَبِيَّةُ (O) and<br>\
↓ العَرَبُ العَرِبَةُ (K) and ↓ العَرَبُ العَرِبَاتُ (CK [but<br>\
this I do not find in any other copy of the K])<br>\
are appellations of The pure, or genuine Arabs:<br>\
(S, A, O, K:) or those who spoke the language of<br>\
Yaarub Ibn-Kahtán; which is the ancient language: (Msb:) and ↓ العَرَبُ المُسْتَعْرِبَةُ, (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) as also ↓ العَرَبُ المُتَعَرِّبَةُ, (S, O, K,) is<br>\
an appellation of The insititious [or naturalized<br>\
Arabs]; (K;) those who are not pure, or genuine,<br>\
Arabs: (S, O:) or those who spoke the language<br>\
of Ismá&#39;eel [or Ishmael] the son of Ibráheem [or<br>\
Abraham], i. e., the dialects of El-Hijáz and the<br>\
parts adjacent thereto: (Msb:) and the appellation of ↓ مُسْتَعْرِبَةٌ is thought by Az to apply [also]<br>\
to people not of pure Arabian descent, who have<br>\
introduced themselves among the Arabs, and speak<br>\
their language, and imitate their manner or<br>\
appearance. (TA.) [The former division is<br>\
most reasonably considered as consisting of the<br>\
extinct tribes (&#39;Ád, Thamood, and others mentioned in what follows); or of these together<br>\
with the unmixed descendants of Kahtán, whose<br>\
claims to the appellation of genuine Arabs are<br>\
held by many to be equally valid: and the latter<br>\
division, as consisting of those whose origin is<br>\
referred, through Ma&#39;add and &#39;Adnán, to Ismá&#39;eel<br>\
(or Ishmael), whose wife was descended from<br>\
Kahtán. What I find in the TA, on this subject, is as follows.] The former of these two<br>\
divisions consisted of nine tribes, descendants of<br>\
Irem [or Aram] the son of Sám [or Shem] the<br>\
son of Nooh [or Noah]; namely, &#39;Ád, Thamood,<br>\
Umeiyim, &#39;Abeel, Tasm, Jedees, &#39;Imleek [or<br>\
Amalek], Jurhum, and Webári; and from them<br>\
Ismá&#39;eel [or Ishmael is said to have] learned the<br>\
Arabic language: and the ↓ مُتَعَرِّبَة are [said to be]<br>\
the descendants of Ismá&#39;eel, the descendants of<br>\
Ma&#39;add the son of &#39;Adnán the son of Udd: so<br>\
says Abu-l-Khattáb Ibn-Dihyeh, surnamed Dhun-Nesebeyn: or the former division consisted of<br>\
seven tribes, namely, &#39;Ád, Thamood, &#39;Imleek,<br>\
Tasm, Jedees, Umeiyim, and Jásim; the main<br>\
portion of whom has become extinct, some remains of them, only, being scattered among the<br>\
[existing] tribes: so says IDrd: and the appellation of ↓ العَرَبُ العَارِبَةُ is also given to the descendants of Yaarub the son of Kahtán [only]. (TA.)<br>\
[It should be observed, however, that the appellation of ↓ المُتَعَرِّبَةُ is, by those who hold the extinct<br>\
tribes above mentioned as the only genuine Arabs,<br>\
applied to the unmixed descendants of Kahtán;<br>\
and ↓ المُسْتَعْرِبَةُ, to those who are held to be the<br>\
descendants of Ismá&#39;eel: thus in the Mz, 1st نوع.<br>\
Also, it should be observed that the appellation of<br>\
↓ العَرَبُ العَارِبِةُ, in the conventional language of<br>\
Arabic lexicology, is often applied to the Arabs<br>\
of the classical ages, and the later Arabs of the<br>\
desert who retained the pure language of their<br>\
ancestors, indiscriminately: it is thus applied by<br>\
writers quoted in the Mz (1st نوع) to all the<br>\
descendants of Kahtán, and those of Ma&#39;add the<br>\
son of &#39;Adnán (through whom all the descendants<br>\
of Ismá&#39;eel trace their ancestry) who lived before<br>\
the corruption, among them, of the Arabic language.] ―<br>\
-b3-  ↓ الأَعْرَابُ is the appellation given to<br>\
Those [Arabs] who dwell in the desert; (S, Mgh,<br>\
O, Msb, K;) such as go about in search of herbage and water; and Az adds, whether of the Arabs<br>\
or of their freedmen: he says that it is applied<br>\
to those who alight and abide in the desert, and<br>\
are neighbours of the dwellers in the desert, and<br>\
journey, or migrate, with them, to seek after herbage and water: (Msb:) it is not a pl. of العَرَبُ,<br>\
not being like الأَنْبَاطُ, which is pl. of النَّبَطُ; (S,<br>\
O;) but is a [coll.] gen. n.: (S:) الأَعَارِيبُ occurs<br>\
as its pl. (S, O, K) in chaste poetry: (S:) it has<br>\
no sing. [properly so termed]: (K:) the rel. n. is<br>\
↓ أَعْرَابِىٌّ, (S, O,) which is applied to single person; (Msb;) as also بَدَوِىٌّ: (TA:) Az says, if<br>\
one say to an أَعْرَابِىّ, يَا عَرَبِىُّ, he is pleased; and<br>\
if one say to an عَرَبِىّ, يَا أَعْرَابِىُّ, he is angry.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Authors differ as to the cause why the<br>\
عَرَب were thus called: some say, because of the<br>\
perspicuity of their speech, from إِعْرَابٌ: others,<br>\
that they were so called from Yaarub the son of<br>\
Kahtán, who is said to have been the first that<br>\
spoke the Arabic language; his original language<br>\
having been, as asserted by IDrd, [what the<br>\
Arabs term] Syriac; though some say that<br>\
Ismá&#39;eel was the first that spoke the Arabic<br>\
language; and some, that Yaarub was the first<br>\
that spoke Arabic, and that Ismá&#39;eel was the<br>\
first that spoke the pure Arabic of El-Hijáz, in<br>\
which the Kur-án was revealed: others say that<br>\
the عَرَب were so called from العَرَبَةُ, the name of a<br>\
tract near El-Medeeneh, or a name of Mekkeh<br>\
and the adjacent region, where Ismá&#39;eel settled,<br>\
or the same as Tihámeh [as is said in the Mgh,<br>\
in which this is pronounced to be the most correct<br>\
derivation], or the general name of the peninsula<br>\
of Arabia, which is also called العَرَبَاتُ [as is said<br>\
in the Msb]: but some say that they were so<br>\
called in like manner as were the فُرْس and the<br>\
رُوم and the تُرْك and others, not after the name<br>\
of a land or other than a land, but by the coining<br>\
of the name, not a term expressive of a quality or<br>\
a state or condition &amp;c. (TA.) [If the country<br>\
were called العَرَبَةُ, an inhabitant thereof might be<br>\
called, agreeably with analogy, عَرَبِىٌّ; and then,<br>\
the people collectively, العَرَبُ: but I think that<br>\
the most probable derivation is from the old<br>\
Hebrew word<br>\
עְרֶב, meaning “ a mixed people,”<br>\
which the Arabs assert themselves to have been,<br>\
almost from the first; and in favour of this derivation it may be reasonably urged that the old<br>\
Himyeritic language agrees more in its vocabulary<br>\
with the Hebrew and Phœnician than it does with<br>\
the classical and modern Arabic.]<br>\
