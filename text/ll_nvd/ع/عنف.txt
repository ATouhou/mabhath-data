عَنُفَ بِهِ (S, MA, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
عَلَيْهِ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) with damm, (S, O,)<br>\

TA) and عَنَافَةٌ; (MA, Mgh, TA;) and عَنِفَ بِهِ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَنَفَ; (MA;) [and عَنَفَ, inf. n. عَنْفٌ, is mentioned as syn. with عَنُفَ by Golius and Freytag,<br>\
by the latter as on the authority of the S and K,<br>\
in neither of which do I find it;] He was ungentle, rough, harsh, rigorous, severe, violent, or vehement, with him, or to him: (S, MA, Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
K, TA:) hence the phrase, عَنُفَ عَلَيْهِمْ فِى السَّوْقِ<br>\
[He was ungentle, rough, &amp;c., to them in driving]:<br>\
(Mgh:) and ↓ عنّفهُ and عنّف عَلَيْهِ signify the<br>\
same as عَنُفَ بِهِ: (MA:) you say عَنَّفْتُهُ, inf. n.<br>\
تَعْنِيفٌ; and ↓ أَعْنَفْتُهُ; (Lth, O, K;) both meaning عَنُفْتُ عَلَيْهِ; (TK; [and the same is implied<br>\
in the K;]) both from العُنْفُ: (Lth, O:) or<br>\
↓ التَّعْنِيفُ signifies the upbraiding, or reproaching;<br>\
and blaming, reproving, or censuring: (S, O:)<br>\
you say عنّفهُ, inf. n. تَعْنِيفٌ, (Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
meaning he blamed, reproved, or censured, him;<br>\
(Msb;) or did so with roughness or harshness, and<br>\
vehemence; (K, TA;) omitted in some of the<br>\
copies of the K; (TA;) or did so in anger or<br>\
displeasure; (Msb;) upbraided, or reproached,<br>\
him; blamed, reproved, or censured, him with<br>\
reproach. (TA.)<br>\

also 8, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  In Har p. 386, اعنفت<br>\

5<br>\
تعنّف is expl. by Golius as signifying Incommodè et imperitè aggressus fuit rem, et incepit;<br>\
on the authority of the S: but it is اعتنف that<br>\

اِعْتَنَفْتُ الأَمْرَ I took to, or set about, the<br>\
affair (أَخَذْتُهُ [for أَخَذْتُ فِيهِ or أَخَذْتُ أَفْعَلُهُ])<br>\
with ungentleness, roughness, violence, or vehemence. (S, O, Msb, K, TA. [See also 4.]) I<br>\
entered into, engaged in, did, or performed, the<br>\
affair, (أَتَيْتُهُ,) not having knowledge in it: (O,<br>\
K, TA:) or (K) I was ignorant of the affair;<br>\
(O, K, TA;) and found it troublesome, or difficult, and hard, to do; (TA;) whence the saying<br>\
(O, TA) of Ru-beh, (TA,)<br>\
بِأَرْبَعٍ لَا يَعْتَنِفْنَ العَنَقَا<br>\
[With four legs not ignorant of the pace termed<br>\
عَنَق]: (O, TA:) and [simply] I had no knowledge in the affair: (O:) and اعتنفت الشَّىْءَ I<br>\
took to, or set about, the thing, (أَخَذْتُهُ [as above],)<br>\

the thing, (أَتَيْتُهُ,) not being skilled, nor having<br>\
knowledge, in it. (TA. (See, again, 4.]) ―<br>\

the عَنْعَنَة of Temeem. (O.) ―<br>\

the sitting-place [in the mosque] on Friday, and<br>\
finds another sitting-place without his treading<br>\
therein upon any one, should remove from it,<br>\
says, وَاعْتِنَافُ المَجْلِسِ مَا يَذْعَرُ عَنْهُ النَّوْمَ [i. e. And<br>\
the removing from the sitting-place is a cause of<br>\
scaring from him sleep]: making الاِعْتِنَافُ to be<br>\
the putting himself in motion, and removing from<br>\
place to place; which is like الاِئْتِنَاف [or the beginning, or commencing, anew]. (Az, O.) ―<br>\
