عَنَا, (S, Mgh, Msb,) first pers. عَنَوْتُ, (K,)<br>\
aor. يَعْنُو, (S, Msb,) inf. n. عُنُوٌّ, (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K, *) and ↓ عَنْوَةٌ is the subst. thereof, (Mgh, K, *<br>\
TA,) [and] so is ↓ عَنَآءٌ, (Msb,) or عَنْوَةٌ is its<br>\
inf. n., (MA,) [and so, app., is عَنَآءٌ, in this sense<br>\
as well as in another sense, accord. to the K,]<br>\
He was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive;<br>\
(S, MA, Mgh, Msb, K,) and obedient; (MA,<br>\
TA;) to the truth, &amp;c. (TA.) You say, عَنَا لَهُ<br>\
He was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive,<br>\
to him; or obedient to him. (MA.) And hence<br>\
the saying in the Kur [xx. 110], وَعَنَتِ الْوَجُوهُ<br>\
لِلْحَىِّ القَيُّومِ (S, TA) And the countenances shall<br>\
be lowly &amp;c. [to the Deathless, or Ever-living, the<br>\
Self-subsisting by Whom all things subsist: or<br>\
shall be downcast; like the Hebr. phrases ending<br>\
verses 5 and 6 in Gen. iv.]: or shall be submissive<br>\
like captives: or the meaning is [shall be depressed<br>\
by] the depressing of the forehead and the knee [or<br>\
rather knees] and the hands in the lowering of the<br>\
head and the prostrating oneself [in prayer]: or<br>\
[عَنَت is here from عَنَى, belonging to art. عنى,<br>\
and الوجوه is used by a synecdoche for the persons<br>\
(as being the most noble of all the parts thereof),<br>\
and the meaning is] shall suffer fatigue, or weariness, and shall toil. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَنَا, inf. n. عُنُوٌّ<br>\
(M, Msb, K, TA, accord. to some copies of the<br>\
K [erroneously] عَنْوٌ) and عُنِىٌّ (TA) and عَنَآءٌ;<br>\
(K;) and عَنِىَ; (M, K;) He became a captive:<br>\
(K:) and the latter verb signifies also he stuck<br>\
fast in captivity: (K in art. عنى:) or both of<br>\
these verbs have this latter signification: (Msb:)<br>\
[or] you say, عَنَا فِيهِمْ فُلَانٌ أَسِيرًا Such a one remained among them a captive; and was in a<br>\
state of confinement: (S:) and عَنَآءٌ signifies also<br>\
confinement, or imprisonment, in hardship and<br>\
humiliation. (TA.) Hence the trad., الخَالُ وَارِثُ<br>\
مَنْ لَا وَارِثَ لَهُ يَفُكُّ عُنِيَّهُ i. e. أَسْرَهُ [The maternal<br>\
uncle is the heir of him who has no more nearlyallied heir: he shall loose his (the latter&#39;s) captivity]: meaning [he shall acquit him of] what<br>\
is incumbent on him, and clings to him, because<br>\
of the actions that require punishment or retaliation, the way [or custom] of which is that the<br>\
عَاقِلَة [q. v., of whom he is a member,] bear the<br>\
responsibility for them. (Nh, TA.) And ↓ عَنْوَةٌ<br>\
is the subst. of the verb in this sense also. (K, *<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And عَنَا, aor. يَعْنُو, inf. n. عَنْوَةٌ, He took<br>\
a thing by force: ―<br>\
-b2-  and also he took it peaceably,<br>\
or by surrender: thus having two contr. significations. (Msb.) [But see below, where عَنْوَةٌ is<br>\
expl. as though it were the subst. of the verb in<br>\
these two senses.]<br>\
-A3-  عَنَوْتُ الشَّىْءَ I put forth,<br>\
or produced, the thing: and I made the thing<br>\
apparent, or showed it: (S:) or it has the latter<br>\
signification; (K;) as also عَنَيْتُ الشَّىْءَ: (IKtt,<br>\
TA in art. عنى:) and عَنَوْتُ بِالشَّىْءِ has the former<br>\
signification. (K.) And ↓ عَنْوَةٌ is the subst. of<br>\
the verb thus used, (K, TA,) i. e. in these two<br>\
senses, as well as in others mentioned above.<br>\
(TA.) And one says, عَنَتِ الأَرْضُ بِالنَّبَاتِ, (ISk,<br>\
S, and K in this art. and in art. عنى,) aor. تَعْنُو,<br>\
inf. n. عُنُوٌّ; (ISk, S;) and aor. تَعْنِى; (Ks, S;)<br>\
The land made apparent, or showed, [or put forth,<br>\
or produced,] its plants, or herbage; (S, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ أَعْنَتْهُ. (K.) And لَمْ تَعْنُ بِلَادُنَا بِشَىْءٍ and<br>\
لَمْ تَعْنِ Our country did not give growth to anything. (S.) And الأَرْضُ شَيْئًا ↓ مَا أَعْنَتِ The land<br>\
did not give growth, or has not given growth, to<br>\
anything. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence, app.,] سَأَلْتُهُ فَلَمْ<br>\
يَعْنُ لِى بِشَىْءٍ I asked him, and he did not (لَمْ يَنْدَ<br>\
and لَمْ يَبِضَّ) to me, or for me, anything. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  عَنَتْ بِهِ أُمُورٌ Events befell him. (S, K.) [See<br>\
also 1 in art. عنى.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَنَا الأَمْرُ عَلَيْهِ The<br>\
event, or affair, was difficult, or distressing, to<br>\
him; distressed, or troubled, him. (ISd, K, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  عَنَاهُ الأَمْرُ, aor. يَعْنُوهُ: see 1 in art. عنى, first<br>\
sentence. ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَنَا فِيهِ الأكْلُ, aor. يَعْنُو, inf. n.<br>\
عُنُوٌّ: see 1 in art. عنى.<br>\

[in the TA and in my MS. copy of the K للشىء,<br>\
but see what follows,]) aor. يَعْنُوهُ, inf. n. عنو [app.,<br>\
supposing the verb to be trans. by itself, عَنْوٌ],<br>\
(TA,) The dog came to the thing and smelt it:<br>\
(K, TA:) and one says, هٰذَا يَعْنُو هٰذَا This comes<br>\
to this and smells it. (TA.)<br>\
-A6-  عَنَتِ القِرْبَةُ بِمَآءٍ<br>\
كَثِيرٍ, (K, TA,) aor. تَعْنُو, (TA,) The water-skin<br>\
did not keep, or retain, much water, so that it<br>\
appeared [oozing from it]: (K, TA:) or, as some<br>\
say, عَنَتِ القِرْبَةُ signifies the water-skin let flow its<br>\
water. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَنَا, inf. n. عُنوٌّ, said of<br>\
blood, It flowed. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\
-A7-  And عَنَا, aor.<br>\
يَعْنُو, inf. n. عُنُوٌّ, signifies also قَامَ [He, or it,<br>\
stood; &amp;c.]. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\
-A8-  See also Q. Q. 1.<br>\
2<br>\
عنّاهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. تَعْنِيَةٌ, (S, K,) He imprisoned him, or confined him, (S, K, TA,) long,<br>\
straitening him. (TA.) [See also 4.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
تَعْنِيَةٌ is said to signify Any long confining or restraining: in a trad. of &#39;Alee, respecting the day<br>\
of Siffeen, he is related to have said, اِسْتَشْعِرُوا<br>\
الحَشْيَةَ وَعَنُّوا بِالأَصْوَاتِ i. e. [Make ye fear, or<br>\
awe, (app. of God,) to be the thing next your<br>\
hearts,] and restrain, and suppress, the voices; as<br>\
though he forbade their raising a confused and<br>\
unintelligible clamour. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَنَّيْتُ البَعِيرَ,<br>\
(S,) inf. n. as above, (S, K,) I smeared the camel<br>\
with عَنِيَّة [q. v.]. (S, K.) [Hence تَعْنِيَةٌ as a<br>\
subst., expl. below.]<br>\
-A3-  See also Q. Q. 1.<br>\
4<br>\
اعناهُ He rendered him lowly, humble, or submissive. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (TA) He made him<br>\
(Msb, K, TA) to stick fast in captivity, (Msb,)<br>\
or to be, (K,) or to remain, or continue, (TA,) a<br>\
captive. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, in two places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اعني الوَلِىُّ الأَرْضَ The وَلِىّ, i. e. the<br>\
rain after the وَسْمِىّ, watered the land so that it<br>\
gave growth to plants, or herbage. (S, * IKtt,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اعنى الرَّجُلُ The man found, or<br>\

as is termed عُشْب, [for قد اعشرت (to which I<br>\

pasturage had become abundant. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See<br>\
also Q. Q. 1.<br>\
5<br>\
تعنّى He [a camel] was, or became, smeared<br>\
with عَنِيَّة [q. v.]: whence the saying of EshShaabee, لَأَنْ أَتَعَنَّى بِعَنِيَّةٍ أَحَبُّ إِلَىَّ مِنْ أَنْ أَقُولَ<br>\
فِى مَسْأَلَةٍ بِرَأْيِى [Verily my being smeared with<br>\
عَنِيَّة would be more approvable to me than my<br>\
saying respecting a question according to my opinion]. (TA.)<br>\
Q. Q. 1<br>\
عَنْوَنْتُ الكِتَابَ, (S, K, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
عَنْوَنَةٌ and عُِنْوَانٌ, (TA,) i. q. عَلْوَنْتُهُ, (S,) I put<br>\
an عُنْوَان [i. e. a superscription, or title,] to the<br>\
book, or writing; (K, TA;) syn. وَسَمْتُهُ: (TA:)<br>\
and one says also, الكِتَابَ ↓ عَنَا, aor. يَعْنُوهُ, meaning عَنْوَنَهُ; (IKtt, TA;) and ↓ اعناهُ and ↓ عنّاهُ<br>\
and عنّنهُ [which is said to be the original of عَنَّاهُ],<br>\
meaning the same; (K and TA in art. عنى;)<br>\
and عَنَيْتُ الكِتَابَ, inf. n. عَنْىٌ, likewise signifies<br>\
I wrote the عُنْيَان [or عُنْوَان] of the book, or<br>\
writing. (IKtt, TA in art. عنى.)<br>\
عِنًا: see the paragraph next following.<br>\
عِنْوٌ sing. of أَعْنَآءٌ as signifying The sides, regions, quarters, or tracts, (S, K,) of a country,<br>\
(S,) or of the sky; (K;) like أَحْنَآءٌ: (S in art.<br>\
حنو and حنى:) or, accord. to IAar, its sing., in<br>\
this sense, is ↓ عِنًا: (S:) and the pl. signifies also<br>\
the sides of the face. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And sing. of أَعْنَآءٌ<br>\
as signifying A party of men of sundry, or different, tribes. (S, K.)<br>\
عَنْوَةٌ Force, or constraint: (Mgh, K, TA:) or<br>\
the taking by force; (Msb, TA;) as inf. n. of<br>\
عَنَا [q. v.]. (Msb.) One says, فُتِحَتْ مَكَّةُ عَنْوَةً<br>\
Mekkeh was taken forcibly, or by force. (Mgh.)<br>\
And أَخَذَهُ عَنْوَةً He took it by force. (TA.) And<br>\
فُتِحَتْ هٰذِهِ المَدِينَةُ عَنْوَةً i. e. [This city was taken]<br>\
by means of conflict; its occupants having been<br>\
combated until they had it taken from them by<br>\
superior power or force, and were powerless to<br>\
keep it, so they left it without there having occurred between them and the Muslims [or invaders] a treaty of peace. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Love,<br>\
or affection: (ISd, K, TA:) or submission, and<br>\
concession: or a consequence of submission and<br>\
concession, on the part of him from whom a thing<br>\
is taken: (TA:) or the taking peaceably, or by<br>\
surrender; as inf. n. of عَنَا [q. v.]: (Msb:) thus<br>\
it has two contr. significations. (Msb, K, TA.)<br>\
A poet (cited by Fr, TA) says,<br>\
فَمَا أَخَذُوهَا عَنْوَةً عَنْ مَوَدَّةٍ<br>\
وَلٰكِنَّ ضَرْبَ المَشْرَفِىِّ اسْتَقَالَهَا<br>\
(Msb, TA;) which is said to mean, [And they<br>\
did not take it, or her, or them,] by concession,<br>\
and obedience, [arising from love, or affection,]<br>\
without fighting: [but the smiting of the Mesh-rafee sword demanded the renouncing thereof:]<br>\
&#39;Abd-El-Kádir Ibn-&#39;Amr El-Baghdádee asserts<br>\
the meaning of عَنْوَةٌ to be submission and concession; adducing as evidence thereof this verse;<br>\
attributing the contr. meaning to the vulgar:<br>\
both, however, are correct; and that first mentioned occurs repeatedly in traditions: but the<br>\
most learned Yákoot Er-Roomee, in his Moajam,<br>\
says that the verse above-cited may be rendered<br>\
as meaning and they did not take it, or her, or<br>\
them, by superior power attended by [or in consequence of] love, or affection: but they did so by<br>\
fighting: and that this may be regarded as indicated by the poet&#39;s saying اخذوها; for otherwise<br>\
he would have said, فَمَا سَلَّمُوهَا: and he says, it<br>\
is a matter of common consent that عَنْوَةٌ signifies<br>\
force, and superior power. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is also<br>\
a subst. from عَنَا in the first of senses mentioned<br>\
in this art.: [i. e. it signifies Lowliness, humility,<br>\
or submissiveness:] (Mgh, TA:) [and] so is ↓ عَنَآءٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b4-  And it is also a<br>\
subst. from عَنَا as meaning “ he became a captive: ” [i. e. it signifies also A state of captivity:]<br>\
(TA:) see, again, 1.<br>\
-A2-  And it is also a subst.<br>\
from عَنَا in two other senses, as stated above:<br>\
[i. e. it app. signifies also The act of putting<br>\
forth, or producing, a thing: and of making it<br>\
apparent, or showing, it:] (TA:) see, again, 1.<br>\
عُنْوَانٌ (S, K, TA) and عِنْوَانٌ (TA) The سِمَة<br>\
[meaning superscription, or title,] of a book, or<br>\
writing; (K, TA;) i. q. عُلْوَانٌ; (S;) and عُنْيَانٌ<br>\
signifies the same; (K in art. عنى;) as also<br>\
↓ مُعَنَّى: (K, TA: [in the CK, كَمَعْنَاهُ is put for<br>\
كَمُعَنَّاهُ:]) the inscription on the back, or outside,<br>\
of a book, or writing: (Har p. 163, in explanation of عُنْوَانٌ:) [and the address of a letter. And<br>\
hence,] Anything that serves as an indication of<br>\
another thing is called its عُنْوَان. (Msb and K<br>\
in art. عن.) One says, فِى جَبْهَتِهِ عُنْوَانٌ مِنْ كَثْرَةِ<br>\
السَّجُودِ i. e. [On his forehead is] a mark [from<br>\
much prostration in prayer]. (TA.) [See more<br>\
in art. عن.]<br>\
عَنَآءٌ: see 1, first sentence; and عَنْوَةٌ, near the<br>\
end: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also art. عنى.<br>\
عَنِيَّةٌ, of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ, The urine of the<br>\
camel, inspissated in the sun, with which such as<br>\
is affected with mange, or scab, is smeared; on<br>\
the authority of AA: (S:) or certain mixtures of<br>\
urine and dung of camels, with which the camel<br>\
affected with mange, or scab, is smeared; also<br>\
termed ↓ تَعْنِيَةٌ: (K:) or the urine of camels that<br>\
are caused to void their urine [in my original<br>\
تُسْتَبَانُ is erroneously written for تُسْتَبَالُ] in the<br>\
[season called] رَبِيع when they are satisfied with<br>\
fresh pasture so as to be in no need of water,<br>\
cooked [app. by boiling] until it becomes thick,<br>\
when some flowers of some sorts of herbs, and حَبّ<br>\
المَحْلَب [the prunus mahaleb of Linn.], are<br>\
thrown upon it, and it becomes inspissated thereby,<br>\
then put into small [earthen vessels of the kind<br>\
called] بَسَاتِيق [pl. of بُسْتُوقَةٌ]: or urine [app. of<br>\
camels] mixed with certain things, and kept close<br>\
for some time: or any هِنَآء [generally meaning<br>\
tar, or a kind thereof, with which camels are<br>\
smeared, as a remedy for the mange, or scab].<br>\
(TA.) It is said in a prov., العَنِيَّةُ تَشْفِى الجَرَبَ;<br>\
(S, TA;) or عَنِيَّتُهُ تَشْفِى الجَرَبَ [for مِنَ الجَرَبِ,<br>\
i. e. His عنيّة cures the mange, or scab]: applied<br>\
to the man of good judgment [whose advice is<br>\
like a remedy]. (TA.)<br>\
عَانٍ Lowly, humble, or submissive. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And (Msb, TA) hence, app., (TA,) A captive; (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) fem. عَانِيَةٌ: (Mgh,<br>\
TA:) pl. masc. عُنَاةٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb, TA;) and<br>\
pl. fem. عَوَانٍ. (S, Mgh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَوَانٍ signifies (assumed tropical:)  Women; (Msb, K;) sing. عَانِيَةٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
because they are confined like captives in the<br>\
abodes of their husbands; (Msb;) or because<br>\
they are treated wrongfully and not defended<br>\
against their wrongers. (K.) It occurs in a<br>\
trad. as meaning Females in the condition of<br>\
captives: (Mgh:) or women who are captives;<br>\
or like captives. (IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And it signifies<br>\
also عَوَامِلُ [which, as pl. of عَامِلَةٌ, is used as<br>\
meaning Workers, or labourers; and also, as a<br>\
subst., as meaning the legs of a beast or horse or<br>\
the like]: and it is said to be used by El-Jaadee<br>\
as an epithet applied to the limbs of camels, or<br>\
other beasts, used for riding. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
hence, perhaps, it is applied to The مَكَّاسُون [or<br>\
collectors of the impost termed مَكْس, q. v.]; because they are workers, or labourers, for the<br>\
oppressors. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also (the sing.) Flowing,<br>\
applied to blood, (S, K, TA,) or to water. (TA.)<br>\
مَعْنَوِىٌّ: see art. عنى.<br>\
تَعْنِيَةٌ: [originally inf. n. of 2, q. v.: used as a<br>\
subst.,] see عَنِيَّةٌ.<br>\
مُعَنًّى A stallion [camel] of mean origin, which,<br>\
when excited by lust, is confined in the [enclosure<br>\
called] عُنَّة, because his exercise of the faculty of<br>\
a stallion is avoided: but it is said that it is<br>\
originally مُعَنَّنٌ, from العُنَّةُ; one of the ن being<br>\
changed into ى: (S, TA: *) or of mean origin,<br>\
of which the legs are bound with a rope, when he<br>\
is excited by lust, for that reason. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And A camel of which the people of the Time of<br>\
Ignorance used to displace the سَنَاسِن [pl. of سِنْسِنٌ,<br>\
q. v.] of one of his vertebræ, and to wound his<br>\
hump, in order that he might not be ridden, and<br>\
that no use might be made of his back: this was<br>\
done when his owner possessed a hundred camels,<br>\
he being the camel by which they became a hundred: and this act was termed الأِغْلَاقُ: it may<br>\
be from عَنَآءٌ meaning “ fatigue; ” or from the<br>\
signification of “ confinement from freedom of<br>\
action. ” (TA.)<br>\
