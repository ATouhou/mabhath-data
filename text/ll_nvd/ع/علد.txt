kind termed عِضَاه: but he is incorrect in so saying: it is a tree having hard branches, for which<br>\
the cattle, or camels and other beasts, have no<br>\
desire, and not of the kind termed عِضَاه; and indeed how can it be of the kind thus termed having<br>\
no thorns? nor is it tall, the tallest being of the<br>\
height of a man sitting; but, with its shortness, it<br>\
is dense and compact in its branches. (Az, TA.)<br>\
