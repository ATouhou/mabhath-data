عَلِمَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَلَمَ, inf. n. عِلْمٌ, He knew it; or<br>\
he was, or became, acquainted with it; syn.<br>\
عَرَفَهُ: (S, K:) or he knew it (عَرَفَهُ) truly, or<br>\
certainly: (B, TA:) by what is said above, and<br>\
by what is afterwards said in the K, العِلْمُ and<br>\
المَعْرِفَةُ and الشُّعُورُ are made to have one meaning;<br>\
and this is nearly what is said by most of the<br>\
lexicologists: but most of the critics discriminate<br>\
every one of these from the others; and العِلْمُ,<br>\
accord. to them, denotes the highest quality, because it is that which they allow to be an attribute of God; whereas they did not say [that He<br>\
is] عَارِفٌ, in the most correct language, nor شَاعِرٌ:<br>\
(TA:) [respecting other differences between العِلْم<br>\
and المَعْرِفَة, the former of which is more general<br>\
in signification than the latter, see the first paragraph of art. عرف: much might be added to what<br>\
is there stated on that subject, and in explanation<br>\
of العِلْم, from the TA, but not without controversy:] or عَلِمَ signifies تَيَقَّنَ [i. e. he knew a<br>\
thing, intuitively, and inferentially, as expl. in the<br>\
Msb in art. يقن]; العِلْمُ being syn. with اليَقِينُ;<br>\
but it occurs with the meaning of الَمَعْرِفَةُ, like as<br>\
المَعْرِفَةُ occurs with the meaning of العلْمُ, each<br>\
being made to import the meaning of the other<br>\
because each is preceded by ignorance [when<br>\
not attributed to God]: Zuheyr says, [in his<br>\
Mo&#39;allakah,]<br>\
وَأَعْلَمُ عِلْمَ اليَوْمِ وَالْأَمْسِ قَبْلَهُ<br>\
وَلٰكِنِّنِى عَنْ عِلْمِ مَا فِى غَدٍ عَمِ<br>\
meaning وَأَعْرِفُ [i. e. And I know the knowledge<br>\
of the present day, and of yesterday before it;<br>\
but to the knowledge of what will be to-morrow I<br>\
am blind]: and it is said in the Kur [viii. 62],<br>\
لَا تَعْلَمُونَهُمْ اَللّٰهُ يَعْلَمُهُمْ, meaning لَا تَعْرِفُونَهُمْ اَللّٰهُ<br>\
يَعْرِفُهُمْ [i. e. Ye know them not, but God knoweth<br>\
them]; المَعْرِفَة being attributed to God because<br>\
it is one of the two kinds of عِلْم, [the intuitive<br>\
and the inferential,] and the discrimination between them is conventional, on account of their<br>\
different dependencies, though He is declared to<br>\
be free from the imputation of antecedent ignorance and from acquisition [of knowledge], for<br>\
He knows what has been and what will be and<br>\
how that which will not be would be if it were,<br>\
his عِلْم being an eternal and essential attribute:<br>\
when عَلِمَ denotes اليَقِين, it [sometimes] has two<br>\
objective complements; but as syn. with عَرَفَ,<br>\
it has a single objective complement: (Msb:)<br>\
it has two objective complements in the saying,<br>\
in the Kur [lx. 10], فَإِنْ عَلِمْتُمُوهُنَّ مُؤْمِنَاتٍ [And<br>\
if ye know them to be believers]; and [in like<br>\
manner] they allowed one&#39;s saying عَلِمْتُنِى [meaning I knew myself to be], like as they said رَأَيْتُنِى<br>\
and حَسِبْتُنِى &amp;c.: (TA:) and sometimes it imports the meaning of شَعَرَ, and is therefore followed by بِ: (Msb:) [thus] عَلِمَ بِهِ signifies شَعَرَ<br>\
or شَعُرَ (accord. to different copies of the K) [i. e.<br>\
He knew it; as meaning he knew, or had knowledge, of it; was cognizant of it; or understood<br>\
it: or he knew the minute particulars of it: or<br>\
he perceived it by means of any of the senses: and<br>\
sometimes this means he became informed, or<br>\
apprised, of it: and sometimes, he was, or became, knowing in it]: or in this case, [as meaning شَعَرْتُ بِهِ,] you say, عَلِمْتُهُ and عَلِمْتُ بِهِ [I<br>\
knew it; &amp;c.]: (Msb:) and one says, مَا عَلِمْتُ<br>\
بِخَبَرِ قُدُومِهِ, meaning مَا شَعَرْتُ [I knew not, &amp;c.,<br>\
the tidings of his coming, or arrival]. (TA.)<br>\
↓ اعتلمهُ, also, signifies عَلِمَهُ [He knew it; &amp;c.].<br>\
(K.) And one says ↓ تَعَلَّمْ in the place of اِعْلَمْ<br>\
[Know thou; &amp;c.]: ISk says, تَعَلَّمْتُ أَنَّ فُلَانًا<br>\
خَارِجٌ is a phrase used in the place of عَلِمْتُ [as<br>\
meaning I knew, or, emphatically, I know, that<br>\
such a one was, or is, going forth]; adding, [however,] when it is said to thee, اِعْلَمْ أَنَّ زَيْدًا خَارِجٌ<br>\
[Know thou that Zeyd is going forth], thou sayest<br>\
قَدْ عَلِمْتُ [lit. I have known, meaning I do know];<br>\
but when it is said, تَعَلَّمْ أَنَّ زَيْدًا خَارِجٌ, thou dost<br>\
not say, قَدْ تَعَلَّمْتُ; (S:) accord. to IB, these<br>\
two verbs are not used as syn. except in the<br>\
imperative forms: (TA:) [or] عَلِمَ الأَمْرَ and<br>\
↓ تَعَلَّمَهُ are syn. as signifying أَتْقَنَهُ [app. meaning he knew, or learned, the case, or affair,<br>\
soundly, thoroughly, or well: see art. تقن: but I<br>\
think it not improbable, though I do not find it<br>\
in any copy of the K, that the right reading may<br>\
be أَيْقَنَهُ, which is syn. with تَيَقَّنَهُ; an explanation<br>\
of عَلِمَ in the Msb, as mentioned above, being<br>\
تَيَقَّنَ]. (K, TA.) And الجَمِيعُ ↓ تعالمهُ means<br>\
عَلِمُوهُ [i. e. All knew him; &amp;c.]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
عَلِمْتُ عِلْمَهُ [lit. I knew his knowledge, or what<br>\
he knew, app. meaning I tried, proved, or tested,<br>\
him, and so knew what he knew; and hence I<br>\
knew his case or state or condition, or his qualities;]<br>\
is a phrase mentioned by Fr in explanation of<br>\
رَبَأْتُ فِيهِ. (TA voce رَبَأَ, q. v. See also the explanation of لَأَ خْبُرَنَّ خَبَرَكَ, in the first paragraph of<br>\
art. خبر: and see غَبَنُوا خَبَرَهَا, in art. غبن.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
عَلِمْتُ is also used in the manner of a verb signifying swearing, or asseveration, so as to have a<br>\
similar complement; as in the saying,<br>\
وَلَقَدْ عَلِمْتُ لَتَأْتِيَنَّ عَشِيَّةً<br>\
[And I certainly knew that thou wouldst, or that<br>\
she would, assuredly come in the evening]. (TA<br>\
in art. شهد.) And يَعْلَمُ اللّٰهُ [God knoweth] is a<br>\
form of asseveration. (IAth, TA voce قَيْرَوَانٌ:<br>\
see an ex. in art. قير.)<br>\
-A2-  عَلُمَ, agreeably with<br>\
what is said in the M, which is عَلُمَ هُوَ نَفْسُهُ, accord. to the K عَلِمَ هُوَ فِى نَفْسِهِ, but the verb in<br>\
this case is correctly like كَرُمَ, (TA,) He was,<br>\
or became, such as is termed عَالِم and عَلِيم; (M, *<br>\
K, * TA;) meaning he possessed knowledge (العِلْم)<br>\
as a faculty firmly rooted in his mind: (IJ, *<br>\
TA:) accord. to IB, i. q. ↓ تعلّم [q. v., as intrans.]: and he was, or became, equal to the عُلَمَآء<br>\
[pl. of عَالِمٌ and of عَلِيمٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  عَالَمَهُ فَعَلَمَهُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَلُمَ: see 3.<br>\
-A4-  عَلَمَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَلُمَ and<br>\
عَلِمَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
عَلْمٌ, (TA.) signifies He marked it; syn. وَسَمَهُ.<br>\
(K.) And one says, عَلَمْتُ عِمَّتِى, meaning I<br>\
wound my turban upon my head with a mark<br>\
whereby its mode should be known. (TA.) [See<br>\
also 4.]<br>\
-A5-  عَلَمَ شَفَتَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَلِمَ, (S, K,) inf. n. عَلْمٌ,<br>\
(S,) He slit his [upper] lip. (S, K.)<br>\
-A6-  عَلِمَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَلَمَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. عَلَمٌ, (S, Msb,) He<br>\
(a man, S) had a fissure in his upper lip: (S,<br>\
Msb, K:) or in one of its two sides. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
علّمهُ [He, or it, made him to be such as is<br>\
termed عَالِم and عَلِيم; i. e., made him to possess<br>\
knowledge (العِلْم) as a faculty firmly rooted in<br>\
his mind: and hence, he taught him. And it<br>\
generally has a second objective complement].<br>\
You say, عَلَّمْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ [I made him to know, or<br>\
taught him, the thing], in which case the teshdeed<br>\
is [said to be] not for the purpose of denoting<br>\
muchness [of the action; but see what follows];<br>\
(S;) and عَلَّمْتُهُ الفَاتِحَةَ [I taught him the Opening<br>\
Chapter of the Kur-án], and الصَّنْعَةَ [the art, or<br>\
craft], &amp;c.; inf. n. تَعْلِيمٌ; (Msb;) and علّمهُ<br>\
العِلْمَ, inf. n. تَعْلِيمٌ and عِلَّامٌ, the latter like<br>\
كِذَّابٌ; and إِيَّاهُ ↓ اعلمهُ; (K;) both, accord. to<br>\
the K, signifying the same [i. e. he taught him<br>\
knowledge, or science]; but Sb makes a distinction<br>\
between them, saying that عَلَّمْتُ is like أَذَّنْتُ,<br>\
and that ↓ أَعْلَمْتُ is like آذَنْتُ; and Er-Rághib<br>\
says that ↓ الإِعْلَامُ is particularly applied to quick<br>\
information; and التَّعْلِيمُ is particularly applied to<br>\
that which is repeated and much, so that an impression is produced thereby upon the mind of<br>\
the مُتَعَلِّم: and some say that the latter is the<br>\
exciting the attention of the mind to the conception<br>\
of meanings; and sometimes it is used in the<br>\
sense of الإِعْلَام when there is in it muchness:<br>\
(TA:) you say, الخَبَرَ ↓ أَعْلَمْتُهُ and بِالخْبَرِ [meaning I made known, or notified, or announced, to<br>\
him, or I told him, or I made him to know, or<br>\
have knowledge of, the news, or piece of information; I acquainted him with it; told, informed, apprised, advertised, or certified, him of it; gave<br>\
him information, intelligence, notice, or advice, of<br>\
it]: (Msb:) see also 10: [hence the inf. n. ↓ إِعْلَامٌ<br>\
is often used, as a simple subst., to signify a notification, a notice, an announcement, or an advertisement:] and sometimes ↓ اعلم has three objective complements, like أَرَى; as in the saying,<br>\
أَعْلَمْتُ زَيْدًا عَمْرًا مُنْطَلِقًا [I made known, &amp;c., to<br>\
Zeyd that &#39;Amr was going away]. (I&#39;Ak p. 117.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also 4, in three places.<br>\
3<br>\
عَاْلَمَ ↓ عَالَمَهُ فَعَلَمَهُ, aor. of the latter<br>\
عَلُمَ, means<br>\
[I contended with him, or strove to surpass him, in<br>\
عِلْم,] and I surpassed him in عِلْم [i. e. knowledge,<br>\
&amp;c.]: (S, K:) [the measure يَفْعَلُ,] and in like<br>\
manner the measure يَفْعِلُ, in every case of this<br>\
kind, is changed into يَفْعُلُ: so says Az: [but<br>\
see 3 in art. خصم:] and Lh mentions the phrase,<br>\
مَا كُنْتُ أَرَانِى أَنْ أَعْلُمَهُ [I did not think, or know,<br>\
that I should surpass him in knowledge]. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَعْلَمَ see 2, in six places. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also, اعلم<br>\
الثَّوْبَ (S, Mgh, TA) He (i. e. a beater and washer<br>\
and whitener of clothes, S, Mgh) made the garment, or piece of cloth, to have a mark; (Mgh;)<br>\
or he made upon it, or in it, a mark. (TA.)<br>\
[And, said of a weaver, or an embroiderer,] He<br>\
made to the garment, or piece of cloth, a border,<br>\
or borders, of figured, or variegated, or embroidered, work, or the like. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
اعلم عَلَيْهِ He made, or put, or set, a mark upon<br>\
it; namely, a writing, or book, &amp;c.: (Msb:)<br>\
[or] اعلم عَلَى مَوْضِعِ كَذَا مِنَ الكِتَابِ عَلَامَةً [He<br>\
made, &amp;c., a mark upon such a place of the<br>\
writing, or book]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اعلم الفَرَسَ He suspended upon the horse some coloured wool, (K,<br>\
TA,) red, or white, (TA,) in war, or battle. (K,<br>\
TA.) And اعلم نَفْسَهُ He marked himself with<br>\
the mark, sign, token, or badge, of war; as also<br>\
↓ عَلَّمَهَا. (K.) [Or] اعلم الفَارِسُ The horseman<br>\
made, or appointed, for himself, [or distinguished<br>\
himself by,] the mark, sign, token, or badge, of the<br>\
men of courage. (S.) And لَهُ عَلَامَةً ↓ عَلَّمْتُ I<br>\
appointed to him (وَضَعْتُ لَهُ) a mark, sign, or<br>\
token, which he would, or should, know. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And القَبْرَ ↓ علّم (K in art. رجم) He put a<br>\
tombstone [as a mark] to the grave. (TK in that<br>\
art.)<br>\
-A2-  اعلم said of a well-sinker, He found the<br>\
well that he was digging to be one having much<br>\
water. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعلّم is quasi-pass. of 2 [i. e. it signifies He<br>\
was, or became, made to know, or taught; or he<br>\
learned: and is trans. and intrans.]. (S, Msb,<br>\
K, * TA.) You say, تعلّم العِلْمَ (MA, K) He<br>\
learned [knowledge, or science]. (MA.) See also 1,<br>\
latter half, in three places. [In the last of those<br>\
places, تعلّم app. signifies, as it often does, He<br>\
possessed knowledge as a faculty firmly rooted in<br>\
his mind.] Accord. to some, التَّعَلُّمُ signifies The<br>\
mind&#39;s having its attention excited to the conception<br>\
of meanings, or ideas. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تعالمهُ الجَمِيعُ: see 1, latter half.<br>\
8<br>\
اعتلمهُ: see 1, latter half.<br>\
-A2-  اعتلم said of<br>\
water, It flowed (K, TA) upon the ground.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And said of lightning it means لَمَعَ فى<br>\
العلم [app. فِى العَلَمِ, and, if so, meaning It<br>\
shone, shone brightly, or gleamed, in, or upon, the<br>\
long mountain]: a poet says,<br>\
بَلْ بُرَيْقًا بِتُّ أَرْقُبُهُ<br>\
لَا يُرَى إِلَّا إِذَا اعْتَلَمَا<br>\
[But a little lightning, in watching which I passed<br>\
the night, not to be seen save when it shone, &amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استعلمهُ He asked, or desired, him to tell<br>\
him [a thing; or to make it known to him].<br>\
(MA, KL. *) You say, ↓ اِسْتَعْلَمَنِى الخَبَرَ فَأَعْلَمْتُهُ<br>\
إِيَّاهُ [He asked, or desired, me to tell him, or make<br>\
known to him, the news, or piece of information,<br>\
and I told him it, or made it known to him]. (S.)<br>\
عَلْمٌ: see مَعْلَمٌ, in two places.<br>\
عِلْمٌ is an inf. n., (S, K, &amp;c.,) and [as such]<br>\
has no pl. [in the classical language]. (Sb, TA<br>\
voce فِكْرٌ.) [As a post-classical term, used as a<br>\
simple subst., its pl. is عُلُومٌ, signifying The<br>\
sciences, or several species of knowledge.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Sometimes it is applied to Predominant opinion; [i. e.<br>\
preponderant belief;] because it stands in stead<br>\
of that which is عِلْم properly so termed. (Ham<br>\
p. 632.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And sometimes it is used in the sense<br>\
of عَمَلٌ [A doing, &amp;c.], as mentioned by Az, on<br>\
the authority of Ibn-&#39;Oyeyneh, agreeably with<br>\
an explanation of عَالِمٌ as signifying one “ who<br>\
does according to his knowledge; ” and it has<br>\
been expl. as having this meaning in the Kur<br>\
xii. 68 [where the primary meaning seems to be<br>\
much more apposite]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  لَقِيتُهُ أَدْنَى عِلْمٍ<br>\
means [I met him the first thing, like لقيته أَدْنَى<br>\
دَنِّىِ and أَدْنَى دَنًا; or] before everything [else].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عَلَمٌ: see عَلَامَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also An impression, or<br>\
impress; or a footstep, or track, or trace. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And The عَلَم of a garment, or piece of cloth;<br>\
(S;) [i. e. the ornamental, or figured, or variegated, border or borders thereof;] the figured, or<br>\
variegated, or embroidered, work or decoration,<br>\
(Msb, K, TA,) in the borders, (TA,) thereof:<br>\
(Msb, K, TA:) pl. أَعْلَامٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And [A<br>\
way-mark; i. e.] a thing set up, or erected, in the<br>\
way, (K, TA,) or, as in the M, in the deserts, or<br>\
waterless deserts, (TA,) for guidance, (K, TA,)<br>\
in the M, for the guidance of those going astray;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ عَلَامَةٌ: (K:) the former is also<br>\
applied to a building raised in the beaten track<br>\
of the road, of such as are places of alighting for<br>\
travellers, whereby one is guided to the land [that<br>\
is the object of a journey]: pl. أَعْلَامٌ: and عَلَمٌ also<br>\
signifies a مَنَارَة [app. a mistranscription for مَنَار,<br>\
without ة: see these two words]. (TA. [See<br>\
also مَعْلَمٌ.]) [Hence, أَعْلَامُ الكَوَاكِبِ The stars,<br>\
or asterisms, that are signs of the way to travellers:<br>\
see مِصْبَاحٌ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And A separation between two<br>\
lands; [like مَنَارٌ;] as also ↓ عَلَامَةٌ. (K.) [Hence,]<br>\
أَعْلَامُ الحَرَمِ The limits that are set to the Sacred<br>\
Territory. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And A mountain; (S, K;)<br>\
as a general term: or a long mountain: (K:)<br>\
[app. as forming a separation: or as being a<br>\
known sign of the way:] pl. أَعْلَامٌ and عِلَامٌ:<br>\
(K:) the former pl. occurring in the Kur [xlii.<br>\
31 and] lv. 24. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And A banner, or<br>\
standard, syn. رَايَةٌ, (S, K, TA,) to which the<br>\
soldiers congregate: (TA:) and, (K,) some say,<br>\
(TA,) the thing [i. e. flag, or strip of cloth,] that<br>\
is tied upon the spear: (K, TA:) it occurs in a<br>\
verse of Aboo-Sakhr El-Hudhalee with the<br>\
second fet-hah lengthened by an alif after it [so<br>\
that it becomes ↓ عَلَام]. (IJ, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And (tropical:)  The<br>\
chief of a people or party: (K, TA:) from the<br>\
same word as signifying “ a mountain ” or “ a<br>\
banner: ” (TA:) pl. أَعْلَامٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b9-  [In grammar, it signifies A proper name of a person or<br>\
place &amp;c. ―<br>\
-b10-  And the pl. أَعْلَامٌ is applied to<br>\
Things pertaining to rites and ceremonies of the<br>\
pilgrimage or the like, as being signs thereof; such<br>\
as the places where such rites and ceremonies are<br>\
performed, the beasts destined for sacrifice, and<br>\
the various practices performed during the<br>\
pilgrimage &amp;c.; as also مَعَالِمُ, pl. of ↓ مَعْلَمٌ: the<br>\
former word is applied to such places in the Ksh<br>\
and Bd and the Jel in ii. 153; and the latter, in<br>\
the Ksh and Bd in ii. 194: the former is also<br>\
applied to the beasts destined for sacrifice in the<br>\
Ksh and Bd and the Jel in xxii. 37; and the<br>\
latter, in the Ksh and Bd in xxii. 33: and both<br>\
are applied to the practices above mentioned,<br>\
the former in the TA and the latter in the K, in<br>\
art. شعر: see شِعَارٌ.]<br>\

عُلَامٌ: see عُلَّامٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. غُلَامٌ [q. v.]: an<br>\
instance of the substitution of ع for غ. (MF and<br>\
TA on the letter ع.)<br>\
عَلِيمٌ: see عَالِمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  العَلِيمُ and ↓ العَالِمُ and<br>\
↓ العَلَّامُ, as epithets applied to God, signify [The<br>\
Omniscient;] He who knows what has been and<br>\
what will be; who ever has known, and ever will<br>\
know, what has been and what will be; from<br>\
whom nothing is concealed in the earth nor in<br>\
the heaven; whose knowledge comprehends all<br>\
things, the covert thereof and the overt, the small<br>\
thereof and the great, in the most complete manner.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عَلَامَةٌ i. q. سِمَةٌ [A mark, sign, or token, by<br>\
which a person or thing is known; a cognizance,<br>\
or badge; a characteristic; an indication; a<br>\
symptom]; (K; [see also مَعْلَمٌ;]) and ↓ عَلَمٌ is<br>\
syn. therewith [as meaning thus]; (S, Msb,<br>\
TA;) and so ↓ أُعْلُومَةٌ, (Abu-l-&#39;Omeythil ElAarábee, TA,) as in the saying ↓ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ أُعْلُومَةٌ<br>\
[Among the people, or party, is a mark, sign, or<br>\
token]; and the pl. of this last is أَعَالِيمُ: (TA:) the<br>\
pl. of عَلَامَةٌ is عَلَامَاتٌ (Msb) and [the coll.<br>\
gen. n.] ↓ عَلَامٌ, (K, TA,) differing from عَلَامَةٌ<br>\

also عَلَمٌ, in two places.<br>\
عُلَامِىٌّ Light, or active; and sharp, or acute,<br>\

↓ تِعْلَامَةٌ, (K,) Very knowing or scientific or<br>\
learned: (S, K:) the ة in ↓ عَلَّامَةٌ is added to<br>\
denote intensiveness; (S;) or [rather] to denote<br>\
that the person to whom it is applied has attained<br>\
the utmost degree of the quality signified thereby;<br>\
[so that it means knowing &amp;c. in the utmost<br>\
degree; or it may be rendered very very, or singularly, knowing or scientific or learned;] and<br>\
this epithet is applied also to a woman: (IJ,<br>\
TA:) [↓ تِعْلَامَةٌ, likewise, is doubly intensive;<br>\
and so, app., is ↓ تِعْلِمَةٌ:] the pl. of عَلَّامٌ is<br>\
عَلَّامُونَ; and that of ↓ عُلَّامٌ is عُلَّامُونَ. (TA.)<br>\
See also, for the first, عَلِيمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also the same<br>\
epithets, (K,) or عَلَّامٌ and ↓ عَلَّامَةٌ, (TA,) i. q.<br>\
نَسَّابَةٌ; (K, TA;) [or rather عَلَّامٌ signifies نَسَّابٌ,<br>\
i. e. very skilful in genealogies, or a great genealogist; and ↓ عَلَّامَةٌ signifies نَسَّابَةٌ, i. e. possessing<br>\
the utmost knowledge in genealogies, or a most<br>\
skilful genealogist;] from العِلْمُ. (TA.)<br>\
عُلَّامٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, and ↓ عُلَامٌ, The صَقْر [or<br>\
hawk]; (K;) the latter on the authority of<br>\
IAar: (TA:) and [particularly] the بَاشَق [i. e.<br>\
the musket, or sparrow-hawk]; (K;) as some<br>\
say: (TA:) or so the former word, (T, * S, TA,)<br>\
or the latter word accord. to Kr and IB. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And the former word, The [plant called] حِنَّآء<br>\
[i. e. Lawsonia inermis]: (IAar, S, K, TA:) thus<br>\
correctly, but mentioned by Kr as without tesh-deed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And the same, i. e. with tesh-deed, The kernel of the stone of the نَبِق [or fruit,<br>\
i. e. drupe, of the lote-tree called سِدْر]. (TA.)<br>\
عَلَّامَةٌ: see عَلَّامٌ, in four places.<br>\
عُلَّامَةٌ: see مَعْلَمٌ.<br>\
العَالَمُ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) said by some to be<br>\
also pronounced ↓ العَالِمُ, (MF, TA,) and pronounced by El-Hajjáj with hemz [i. e. العَأْلَمُ], is<br>\
primarily a name for That by means of which one<br>\
knows [a thing]; like as الخَاتَمُ is a name for<br>\
“ that by means of which one seals ” [a thing]:<br>\
accord. to some of the expositors of the Kur-án,<br>\
its predominant application is to that by means of<br>\
which the Creator is known: then to the intelligent beings of mankind and of the jinn or genii:<br>\
or to mankind and the jinn and the angels: and<br>\
mankind [alone]: Es-Seyyid Esh-Shereef [El-<br>\
Jurjánee] adopts the opinion that it is applied to<br>\
every kind [of these, so that one says عَالَمُ الإِنْسِ<br>\
(which may be rendered the world of mankind)<br>\
and عَالَمُ الجِنِّ (the world of the jinn or genii)<br>\
and عَالَمُ المَلَائِكَةِ (the world of the angels), all of<br>\
which phrases are of frequent occurrence], and<br>\
to the kinds [thereof] collectively: (TA:) or it<br>\
signifies الخَلْقُ [i. e. the creation, as meaning the<br>\
beings, or things, that are created], (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
altogether [i. e. all the created beings or things,<br>\
or all creatures]: (K:) or, as some say, peculiarly, the intelligent creatures: (Msb:) or what<br>\
the cavity (lit. belly) of the celestial sphere comprises, (K, TA,) of substances and accidents:<br>\
(TA:) [it may often be rendered the world, as<br>\
meaning the universe; and as meaning the earth<br>\
with all its inhabitants and other appertenances;<br>\
and in more restricted senses, as instanced above:<br>\
and one says عَالَمُ الحَيَوَانِ meaning the animal<br>\
kingdom, and عَالَمُ النَّبَات the vegetable kingdom, and عَالَمُ المَعَادِنِ the mineral kingdom:]<br>\
Jaafar Es-Sádik says that the عَالَم is twofold:<br>\
namely, العَالَمُ الكَبِيرُ, which is the celestial sphere<br>\
with what is within it; and العَالَمُ الصَّغِيرُ, which<br>\
is man, as being [a microcosm, i. e.] an epitome<br>\
of all that is in the كَبِير: and Zj says that العَالَمُ<br>\
has no literal sing., because it is [significant of]<br>\
a plurality [of classes] of diverse things; and if<br>\
made a sing. of one of them, it is [significant of]<br>\
a plurality of congruous things: (TA:) the pl.<br>\
is العَالَمُونَ (S, M, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and العَوَالِمُ: (S,<br>\
TA:) and the sing. is [said to be] the only instance of a word of the measure فَاعَلٌ having a<br>\
pl. formed with و and ن, (ISd, K, TA,) except<br>\
يَاسَمٌ: (K, TA:) [but see this latter word:]<br>\
العَالَمُونَ signifies the [several] sorts of created<br>\
beings or things: (S:) [or all the sorts thereof:<br>\
or the beings of the universe, or of the whole<br>\
world:] it has this form because it includes mankind: or because it denotes particularly the sorts<br>\
of created beings consisting of the angels and the<br>\
jinn and mankind, exclusively of others: I&#39;Ab is<br>\
related to have explained رَبُّ العَالَمِينَ as meaning<br>\
the Lord of the jinn, or genii, and of mankind:<br>\
Katádeh says, the Lord of all the created beings:<br>\
but accord. to Az, the correctness of the explanation of I&#39;Ab is shown by the saying in the beginning of ch. xxv. of the Kur-án that the Prophet<br>\
was to be a نَذِير [or warner] لِلْعَالَمِينَ; and he<br>\
was not a نذير to the beasts, nor to the angels,<br>\
though all of them are the creatures of God; but<br>\
only to the jinn, or genii, and mankind. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  عَالَمٌ is also syn. with قَرْنٌ [as meaning A<br>\
generation of mankind; or the people of one time].<br>\
(O, voce طَبَقٌ, q. v.)<br>\
عَالِمٌ and ↓ عَلِيمٌ signify the same, (IJ, Msb,<br>\
K, *) as epithets applied to a man; (K;) i. e.<br>\
Possessing the attribute of عِلْم (IJ, Msb, TA) as<br>\
a faculty firmly rooted in the mind; [or learned;<br>\
or versed in science and literature;] the former<br>\
being used in [what is more properly] the sense<br>\
of the latter; (IJ, TA;) which is an intensive<br>\
epithet: (TA:) the pl. is عُلَمَآءُ and عُلَّامٌ, (K,)<br>\
the latter of which is pl. of عَالِمٌ; (IB, TA;) the<br>\
former being [properly] pl. of عَلِيمٌ; and عَالِمُونَ<br>\
is [a] pl. of عَالِمٌ; (Msb;) [but] عُلَمَآءُ is used as<br>\
a pl. of both, (IJ, TA,) and by him who says<br>\
only عَالِمٌ [as the sing.], (Sb, TA;) because عَالِمٌ<br>\
is used in the sense of عَلِيمٌ: to him who is entering upon the study of العِلْم, the epithet ↓ مُتَعَلِّمٌ<br>\
[which may generally be rendered learning, or a<br>\
learner,] is applied; not عَالِمٌ. (IJ, TA.) عَالِمٌ<br>\
is also expl. as signifying One who does according<br>\
to his knowledge. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also عَلِيمٌ: and<br>\
أَعْلَمُ.<br>\
-A2-  And see العَالَمُ.<br>\
عَيْلَمٌ A well having much water: (S, K:) or<br>\
of which the water is salt: (K:) and a wide well:<br>\
and sometimes a man was reviled by the saying,<br>\
يَا ابْنَ العَيْلَمِ, referring to the width of his mother<br>\
[in respect of the فَرْج]: (TA:) pl. عَيَالِمُ or عَيَالِيمُ.<br>\
(S, accord. to different copies: in the TA, in<br>\
this instance, the latter.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The sea: (S,<br>\
K:) pl. عَيَالِمُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The water upon<br>\
which is the earth: (S, K:) or water concealed,<br>\
or covered, in the earth; or beneath layers, or<br>\
strata, of earth; mentioned by Kr: (TA:) [عَيْلَمُ<br>\
المَآءِ occurs in the JK and TA in art. خسف, and<br>\
is there plainly shown to mean the water that is<br>\
beneath a mountain, or stratum of rock: (see also<br>\
غَيِّثٌ: and see غَيْلَمٌ:) and it is said that] المَأءُ<br>\
العَيْلَمُ means copious water. (Ham p. 750.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And A large cooking-pot. (T, TA voce هِلْجَابٌ.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Plump, and soft, tender, or delicate. (S,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A3-  And The frog. (AAF, K. [This meaning<br>\
is also assigned to غَيْلَمٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. ↓ عَيْلَامٌ;<br>\
(K;) which signifies A male hyena; (S, K;)<br>\
occurring in a trad. (خَبَر) respecting Abraham,<br>\
relating that he will take up his father to pass<br>\
with him the [bridge called] صِرَاط, and will look<br>\
at him, and lo, he will be عَيْلَامٌ أَمْدَرُ [a male<br>\
hyena inflated in the sides, big in the belly, or<br>\
having his sides defiled with earth or dust]. (TA.)<br>\
عَيْلَامٌ: see the next preceding sentence.<br>\
أَعْلَمُ [More, and most, knowing or learned].<br>\
Applied to God, [it may often be rendered<br>\
Supreme in knowledge: or omniscient: but often,<br>\
in this case,] it means [simply] ↓ عَالِمٌ [in the<br>\
sense of knowing, or cognizant]. (Jel in iii. 31,<br>\
and I&#39;Ak p. 240.) [Therefore اَللّٰهُ أَعْلَمُ virtually<br>\
means, sometimes, God knows best; or knows all<br>\
things: and sometimes, simply, God knows.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also [Harelipped; i. e.] having a fissure in his<br>\
upper lip: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) or in one of its two<br>\
sides: (K:) the camel is said to be اعلم because<br>\
of the fissure in his upper lip: when the fissure is<br>\
in the lower lip, the epithet أَفْلَحُ is used: and<br>\
أَشْرَمُ is used in both of these, and also in other,<br>\
similar, senses: (TA:) the fem. of أَعْلَمُ is عَلْمَآءُ:<br>\
(S, Msb, TA:) which is likewise applied to a lip<br>\
(شَفَةٌ). (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  العَلْمَآءُ signifies also The coat<br>\
of mail: (K:) mentioned by Sh, in the book<br>\
entitled كِتَابُ السِّلَاحِ; but as not heard by him<br>\
except in a verse of Zuheyr Ibn-Khabbáb [?].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
أُعْلُومَةٌ: see عَلَامَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
تِعْلِمَةٌ and تِعْلَامَةٌ: see عَلَّامٌ; each in two<br>\
places.<br>\
مَعْلَمٌ i. q. مَظِنَّةٌ; مَعْلَمُ الشَّىْءِ signifying مَظِنَّتُهُ;<br>\
(K, TA;) as meaning The place in which is<br>\
known the existence of the thing: (Msb in art.<br>\
ظن:) pl. مَعَالِمُ; (TA;) which is the contr. of<br>\
مَجَاهِلُ, pl. of مَجْهَلٌ [q. v.] as applied to a land;<br>\
meaning in which are signs of the way. (TA in<br>\
art. جهل.) And hence, [A person in whom is<br>\
known the existence of a quality &amp;c.:] one says,<br>\
هُوَ مَعْلَمٌ لِلْخَيْرِ [He is one in whom good, or goodness, is known to be]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A thing,<br>\

and ↓ عَلْمٌ: (K: [in several copies of which, in<br>\
all as far as I know, وَالعَلْمُ is here put in the<br>\
place of والعَلْمِ; whereby العَلْمُ is made to be syn.<br>\
with العَالَمُ: but accord. to SM, it is syn. with<br>\
المَعْلَمُ, as is shown by what here follows:]) and<br>\
hence a reading in the Kur [xliii. 61], ↓ وَإِنَّهُ لَعَلْمٌ<br>\
لِلسَّاعَةِ, meaning And verily he, i. e. Jesus, by his<br>\
appearing, and descending to the earth, shall be<br>\
a sign of the approach of the hour [of resurrection]: it is also said, in a trad., that on the day<br>\
of resurrection there shall not be a مَعْلَم for any<br>\
one: and the pl. is مَعَالِمُ. (TA.) And مَعْلَمُ الطِّرِيقِ<br>\
signifies The indication, or indicator, of the road,<br>\
or way. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence it signifies likewise An indication, or a symptom, of anything;<br>\
like عَلَامَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  See also عَلَمٌ, last quarter.<br>\
مُعْلَمٌ pass. part. n. of أَعْلَمَ [q. v.] in the phrase<br>\
اعلم الثَّوْبَ, and thus applied as an epithet to a<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth: (S:) [and also in<br>\
other senses: thus in a verse of &#39;Antarah cited<br>\

مَعْلُومٌ [Known; &amp;c.]. الوَقْتُ المَعْلُومُ [mentioned in the Kur xv. 38 and xxxviii. 82] means<br>\
