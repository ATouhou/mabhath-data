عَتڤمَ The primary signification of the inf. n. عَتْمٌ<br>\
in the [genuine] language of the Arabs is that of<br>\
Tarrying [or delaying]: and of withholding, or<br>\
restricting, or limiting, oneself. (TA.) See 2,<br>\
in three places. [Hence,] one says, غَرَسْتُ الوَدِىَّ<br>\
فَمَا عَتَمَ مِنْهَا شَىْءٌ i. e. [I planted the shoots of<br>\
palm-trees,] and not any of them was slow or<br>\
tardy [in its growth]. (S.) And عَتَمَتْ حَاجَتُهُ<br>\
The object of his want was, or became, slow or<br>\
tardy [of accomplishment]; as also ↓ أَعْتَمَتْ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَتَمَ اللَّيْلُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
عَتِمَ, (S, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. عَتْمٌ, (TA,) The night was, or became,<br>\
dark, in the period termed عَتَمَة: (S:) or a<br>\
portion of the night passed; as also ↓ اعتم: (K:)<br>\
the latter mentioned by IAar. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
عَتَمَتِ الإِبِلُ, aor.<br>\
عَتِمَ and<br>\
عَتُمَ, The camels were milked<br>\
at nightfall [i. e. at the commencement of the عَتَمَة];<br>\
as also ↓ أَعْتَمَت and ↓ استعتمت. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See<br>\
also 4.<br>\
2<br>\
تَعْتِيمٌ and ↓ عَتْمٌ signify The being slow, or<br>\
tardy. (S.) You say, عتّم قِرَاهُ and ↓ عَتَمَ His<br>\
entertainment for his guest, or guests, was, or<br>\
became, slow, or tardy; syn. أَبْطَأَ [not أَبْطَأَ بِهِ]:<br>\
(S, K:) and he delayed it: (TA: [but this,<br>\
though virtually a correct rendering, is app. not<br>\
so literally:]) and ↓ اعتم likewise has the former<br>\
meaning: (K:) or قِرَى الضَيْفِ ↓ اعتم signifies he<br>\
delayed the entertainment of the guest. (S.) And<br>\
مَا عَتَّمَ أَنْ فَعَلَ كَذَا He delayed not, or was not<br>\
slow, to do, or in doing, such a thing. (S, K. *)<br>\
And حَاجَتَهُ ↓ اعتم He delayed [the accomplishment of] the object of his want. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
عتّم عَنْهُ He refrained, forbore, abstained, or desisted, from it, (S, K,) namely, an affair, (S,)<br>\
after having made progress therein; as also ↓ اعتم;<br>\
and ↓ عَتَمَ, aor.<br>\
عَتِمَ, (K, TA,) inf. n. عَتْمٌ: (TA:)<br>\
or this last signifies he withheld himself from doing<br>\
it, meaning, a thing that he desired: (K:) and<br>\
↓ اعتم signifies he delayed to do it. (TA.) And<br>\
[hence] one says, ضَرَبَهُ فَمَا عَتَّمَ, (S,) and حَمَلَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ فَمَ عَتَّمَ, (S, K,) i. e. [He beat him, and he<br>\
attacked him,] and did not withhold, or restrict,<br>\
or limit, himself, in beating him, [and in attacking him,] (S,) or and did not recede, or draw<br>\
back, or desist: (K, TA:) the vulgar say,<br>\
ضَرَبَهُ فَمَا عَتَّبَ. (S.) ―<br>\

أَعْتَمَ see 2, in five places: and see also 1, in<br>\
three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  اعتم (S, Msb) from العَتَمَةُ (S)<br>\
is like أَصْبَحَ from الصُّبْحُ; (S, Msb; *) i. e. it<br>\
signifies He entered upon the period termed<br>\
عَتَمَة; (Msb;) as also ↓ عَتَمَ, inf. n. ↓ عَتْمٌ:<br>\
(TA:) or he journeyed in that period; (K, TA;)<br>\
and so ↓ عتّم: (S, K, TA:) or both signify he<br>\
became in the period: (TA:) or he brought [his<br>\
camels] to the watering-place and [in the CK<br>\
“ or ”] he brought [them] back therefrom in that<br>\
period; (K, TA;) and did any kind of work or<br>\
action [therein]. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِعْتَتَمَ [اِعْتَتَمَتِ الإِبِلُ, accord. to Golius, (whom<br>\
Freytag has followed in this instance,) signifies<br>\
the same as اِسْتَعْتَمَت, as on the authority of the<br>\
K, in which I do not find it. He probably found<br>\
the former verb thus written erroneously for أَعْتَمَت<br>\
in this sense, which he has not mentioned.]<br>\
10<br>\
استعتمهُ He deemed him, or reckoned him,<br>\
slow, or tardy. (Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اِسْتَعْتِمُوا نَعَمَكُمْ حَتَّى<br>\
تُفِيقَ means Delay ye the milking of your camels,<br>\
or cattle, until the milk shall have collected: (K,<br>\
TA:) for they used to bring back their camels a<br>\
little after sunset to their nightly resting-place,<br>\
and make them to lie down there a while, until,<br>\
when their milk had collected, after a portion of<br>\
the night had passed, they roused them and<br>\
milked them. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  استعتمت الإِبِلُ: see 1.<br>\
عُتْمٌ and ↓ عُتُمٌ (S, K, but only the former in<br>\
some copies of the S,) The wild olive-tree: (S, K,<br>\
TA:) or such as does not bear anything: or such<br>\
as grows in the mountains: written by IAth ↓ عَتَمٌ,<br>\
and expl. by him as the olive-tree: or a species of<br>\
tree resembling it, growing in the Saráh (السَّرَاة).<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

-A2-  and see also<br>\
عُتْمٌ.<br>\
عُتُمٌ: see عُتْمٌ.<br>\
عَتَمَةٌ Slowness, or tardiness: (IB, TA:) hence<br>\
the saying of a rájiz,<br>\
بِذِى سَلَمْ  طَيْفٌ أَلَمْ<br>\
بَيْنَ الخَيَمْ   ↓ يَسْرِى عَتَمْ<br>\
meaning يَسْرِى بَطِيْئًا, [i. e. A phantom visited<br>\
(أَلَمْ being for أَلَمَّ) in Dhoo-Selem, journeying by<br>\
night slowly amid the tents,] the ة of عَتَمَة [i. e.<br>\
عَتَمَةً] being elided. (TA. [But عَتَمٌ is also<br>\
mentioned in the TA, in the beginning of this<br>\
art., not as being originally عَتَمَةٌ, but simply as a<br>\
subst. in the sense expl. above.])<br>\
-A2-  [Also, in its<br>\
most usual sense,] The first third of the night,<br>\
after the disappearance of the شَفَق [or redness<br>\

K;) the first part of the night, after the setting<br>\
of the light of the شَفَق: (Msb:) or the time of<br>\
the prayer of nightfall: (S, K:) but the calling<br>\
of that prayer the prayer of the عَتَمَة, as the<br>\
Arabs of the desert called it, instead of calling it<br>\
the prayer of the عِشَآء, is said to be forbidden in<br>\
a trad. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَتَمَةُ رُبَعٍ [The عتمة of a<br>\
young camel brought forth in the رَبِيع, which is<br>\

confined at its evening-feed, (K,) is applied to<br>\
the moonlight of the night when the moon is four<br>\
nights old. (S, K.) AZ says, The Arabs say<br>\
in relation to the moon when it is one night old,<br>\
عَتَمَةُ سُخَيْلَةٍ حَلَّ أَهْلُهَا بِرُمَيْلَةٍ [The عتمة of a little<br>\

to the space of the فُوَاق [or time between two<br>\
suckings] of this ربع or of the فواق [or time<br>\
between two milkings] of its mother; or, as<br>\
IAar says, عَتَمَةُ أُمِّ الرُّبَعِ [The عتمة of the mother<br>\
of the ربع]: and when it is five nights old,<br>\
حَدِيثٌ وَأُنْسٌ وَبَقَآءُ عَشَآءِ خَلِفَاتٍ قُعْسٍ [Discourse<br>\
and sociableness, and the continuance of the evening-feed of pregnant camels having their heads<br>\

these ten sayings is fancifully framed so as to<br>\
rhyme, perfectly or imperfectly, with words preceding it: the first being preceded by اِبْنُ لَيْلَةٍ;<br>\
the second, by اِبْنُ لَيْلَتَيْنِ; the third, by اِبْنُ<br>\
ثَلَاثٍ; the fourth, by اِبْنُ أَرْبَعٍ; and so on.] ―<br>\

عَتَمَةٌ signifies also The darkness of the night: (S,<br>\

night, [after nightfall, i. e.] after the setting of<br>\
