[app. He came to the man, or upon him, with a<br>\
vehement coming; for it seems that الرَّجُلَ is<br>\

that the verb mostly used is the former, and its<br>\
part. n. is ↓ مَعْرُوٌّ: but some say that the verb<br>\
[i. e. عُرِيَت; imperfectly written in my copy of<br>\
the TA, but cleared from doubt by its being<br>\
there added that the part. n. is مَعْرُوَّةٌ,] is said<br>\
of a fever, as meaning it came with a shivering,<br>\

(S; and K in art. عرى.)<br>\

dates (S, K, the latter in art. عرى,) فِى كُلِّ وَجْهٍ<br>\

is said in the Tekmileh to signify persons who are<br>\

عُرْوَةٌ primarily signifies A thing by means of<br>\
which another thing is rendered fast, or firm, and<br>\
upon which reliance is placed: (TA:) or it is<br>\
metaphorically applied in this sense; from the<br>\
same word as signifying an appertenance of a<br>\

(Mgh, Msb. *) ―<br>\

with kesr; but correctly with damm and with<br>\
the ر quiescent [i. e. ↓ عُرْوٌ] as in the Tekmileh;<br>\
and also with kesr [i. e. ↓ عِرْوٌ]; as though these<br>\
two were pls. [or rather coll. gen. ns.] of عروة<br>\
[i. e. عُرْوَةٌ and عِرْوَةٌ]: (TA:) the pl. is عُرًى:<br>\
(Msb:) عراوى [i. e. عَرَاوَى] as pl. of عُرْوَةٌ is<br>\
vulgar. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [The pl.] عُرًى also signifies<br>\
[in like manner] Certain [well-known] appertenances [i. e. loop] of loads, or burdens, and of the<br>\
camels that bear saddles or burdens: whence the<br>\
trad. لَا تُشَدُّ العُرَى إِلَّا إِلَى ثَلَاثَةِ مَسَاجِدَ [The loops<br>\
of loads shall not be made fast for the purpose of<br>\
journeying save to three mosques; that of Mekkeh,<br>\
that of El-Medeeneh, and that of El-Aksà at<br>\
Jerusalem: see also similar trads. in art. ضرب<br>\
(first paragraph, see. col.,) and in art. عمل<br>\
(conj. 4)]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The عُرْوَة of the leathern<br>\
bucket is likewise well known, (TA,) and so is<br>\
that of the mug: (S, TA:) each is The [loopshaped] handle: (K, TA:) [so too is that of the<br>\
leathern water-bag: (see 2:)] that of the mug is<br>\

and turns to the right and left, with [or at] the<br>\
lower part of the بَظْر [here meaning the clitoris]:<br>\
(K, TA;) each of what are termed عُرْوَتَانِ [i. e.<br>\
the nymphæ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And عُرْوَةٌ signifies also<br>\
A collection of [the trees called] عِضَاه and of [those<br>\
called] حَمْض that are depastured in the case of<br>\
drought: (K:) or especially a collection of عِضَاه<br>\
upon which men pasture [their beasts or cattle]<br>\
when they experience drought: or such as remain<br>\
of عِضَاه and of حَمْض and are depastured in the<br>\
case of drought; and it is not applied to any trees<br>\
but these, unless to any trees that have remained<br>\
in the صَيْف [here app. meaning spring, having<br>\
survived the winter]: (TA:) also tangled, or<br>\
luxuriant, or abundant and dense, trees, among<br>\
which the camels pass the winter, and whereof<br>\
they eat: (K:) and (as some say, TA) tree of<br>\
which the leaves fall not in the winter, (K, TA,)<br>\
such as the أَرَاك and the سِدْر: (TA:) or trees that<br>\
remain incessantly in the earth, not going: (S:)<br>\
or such as suffice the camels. or cattle, throughout<br>\
the gear: (TA:) or shrubs of which the lower<br>\
portions remain in the earth, such as the عَرْفَج<br>\
and the نَصِىّ and the several kinds of خُلَّة and<br>\
حَمْض; so that when, men experience drought, the<br>\
cattle gain the means of subsistence; thus accord.<br>\
to Az: or pasture that remains after the [other]<br>\
herbage has dried up; because the cattle cling<br>\
thereto, or eat thereof in the winter. (تَتَعَلَّقُ بِهَا,)<br>\
and are preserved thereby: wherefore they are<br>\
also called عُلْقَة: (Mgh: [but for عَلَقة in my<br>\
copy of that work, I have substituted عُلْقَة as<br>\
being evidently the right word:]) [see also عُقْدَةٌ,<br>\
in the last quarter of the paragraph, in two<br>\
places:] the pl. is عُرًى. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Also The<br>\
environs of a town [where people pasture their<br>\
cattle]. (K, TA.) One says, رَعَيْنَا عُرْوَةَ مَكَّةَ i. e.<br>\

-b8-  And the pl., عُرًى, signifies (tropical:)  A<br>\
company, or party, of men by whom one benefits,<br>\
or profits; as being likened to the trees [so called]<br>\

-b10-<br>\
عُرْوَةُ الصَّعَالِيكِ means (assumed tropical:)  The stay, or support, of<br>\
the صعاليك [i. e. poor, or needy]: and [hence] is<br>\
the name [or a surname] of a well-known man.<br>\
(TA. [See صُعْلُوكٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b11-  العُرْوَةُ الوُثْقَى signifies<br>\
The firmest thing upon which one lays hold: (Bd<br>\
in xxxi. 21: [see also ii. 257, where the same<br>\
phrase occurs:]) and is [said to be] the saying<br>\
“ There is no deity but God: ” from العُرْوَةُ [in<br>\
the first of the senses assigned to it above, as is<br>\
indicated in the Msb in relation to a similar<br>\
phrase here following; or] as signifying “ the<br>\
trees that have a lower portion remaining in the<br>\
earth, as the نَصِىّ and the عَرْفَج &amp;c.; ” as expl.<br>\
above. (TA.) And أَوْثَقُ عُرًى [The firmest of<br>\

عُرَوَآءُ A tremour, or shivering: (Mz, 40th نوع:)<br>\
or the access of a fever, on the occasion of the first<br>\
tremour, or shivering, thereof. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And<br>\
accord. to Freytag, it occurs in the Deewán of<br>\
the Hudhalees as meaning The coming of a hero,<br>\
and the tremour thence arising in others. ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
A feeling of yearning, or longing:] see 1, last<br>\

عَرِىٌّ an epithet applied to a palm-tree such as<br>\
is termed عَرِيَّةٌ [q. v.]: one says نَخْلَةٌ عَرِىٌّ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) the latter word without ة; like as one<br>\
says اِمْرَأَةٌ قَتِيلٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  And رِيحٌ عَرِيَّةٌ (S,<br>\
K) and عَرِىٌّ (K) A cold wind. (S, K: mentioned<br>\

our evening is cold]. (El-Kilábee, S.) And<br>\
لَيْلَةٌ عَرِيَّةٌ A cold night. (TA.)<br>\

Msb, K *) during a year: (S, Mgh, K:) and of<br>\
which what was upon it has been eaten: (K:) so<br>\
some say: or that does not retain its fruit, this<br>\
becoming scattered from it: (TA:) and one that<br>\
has been excluded from the bargaining on the<br>\
occasion of the selling of palm-trees: (K:) so<br>\
some say: (TA:) the pl. is عَرَايَا: (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) it is said that on the occasion of the<br>\
prohibition of المُزَابَنَة, which is the selling of the<br>\
fruit upon the heads of palm-trees for dried dates,<br>\
license was conceded in respect of the عَرَايَا, because a needy man, attaining to the season of<br>\
fresh ripe dates, and having no money with<br>\
which to buy them for his household, nor any<br>\
palm-trees to feed them therefrom, but having<br>\
some dried dates remaining of his food, would<br>\
come to the owner of palm-trees, and say to him,<br>\
“ Sell to me the fruit of a palm-tree,” or “ of two<br>\
palm-trees,” and would give him those remaining<br>\
dried dates for that fruit: therefore license was<br>\
conceded in respect of that fruit when less than<br>\
five أَوْسُق [pl. of pauc. of وَسْقٌ, q. v.]: (Nh, TA:<br>\
[and the like is said, but much less fully, in the<br>\
Mgh; and somewhat thereof in the S:]) the<br>\
word is of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولَةٌ, because the person to whom it is<br>\
assigned repairs to it (S, Nh, * Mgh, Msb, TA)<br>\
to gather its fruit: (Mgh:) or the tree is so<br>\
called because it is freed from prohibition, (Nh,<br>\
Mgh, TA,) from عَرِىَ, aor. يَعْرَى, (Nh, TA,) in<br>\
which case the word is of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ in<br>\
the sense of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ; or because it is<br>\
as though it were divested of its fruit: (Mgh:)<br>\
the ة is affixed because the word is reckoned<br>\
among substs., like نَطِيحَةٌ and أَكِيلَةٌ. (S, Msb.)<br>\
[It is mentioned in the K in art. عرى. See also<br>\
عَرِىٌّ, above.] ―<br>\

made of palm-leaves, in which dates &amp;c. are carried]. (K and TA in art. عرى. [In the CK,<br>\

[<br>\

meaning I came to thee, or have come to thee, as<br>\
a guest [or seeking thy beneficence, with my clothes<br>\
old and worn out, in fear, various thoughts being<br>\

the TA, in the CK عُروان,) A certain plant:<br>\
