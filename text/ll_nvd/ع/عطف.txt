عَطَفَ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
عَطِفَ, (O,<br>\
K,) inf. n. عُطُوفٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) or عَطْفٌ, (O,<br>\
TA,) He, or it, (a man, S, O, or a thing, Msb,)<br>\
inclined; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) or bent: (MF,<br>\
TA:) and ↓ انعطف also has the former meaning,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, * TA,) as in the saying انعطف نَحْوَهُ<br>\
i. e. he, or it, inclined towards him, or it; (TA;)<br>\
[or the latter meaning;] or it became inclined,<br>\
(Msb,) or became bent, (S, * O, Msb, K,) or both,<br>\
(TA,) as quasi-pass. of عَطَفَهُ; (S, O, Msb, TA;)<br>\
and ↓ تعطّف likewise has both of these meanings,<br>\
as quasi-pass. of عطّفهُ, or [signifies it became<br>\
much inclined and bent, for] عطّف is with teshdeed<br>\
to denote muchness. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (MF,<br>\
TA,) عَطَفَ عَلَيْهِ, (S, Mgh, MA, O, K,) [aor. as<br>\
above,] inf. n. عَطْفٌ; (MA, MF, TA;) and<br>\
عليه ↓ تعطّف; (S, MA, O, K;) [and ↓ انعطف<br>\
عليه;] (tropical:)  He was, or became, favourably inclined<br>\
towards him; or affectionate, or kind, to him;<br>\
(MA, PS;) he regarded him, or treated him,<br>\
with mercy or pity or compassion; (MA, Mgh;)<br>\
because in mercy, or pity, or compassion, is an<br>\
inclining towards its object; (Mgh;) i. q. أَشْفَقَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ; (S, O, K;) and وَصَلَهُ, and بَرَّهُ. (TA in<br>\
explanation of the second.) And عَطَفَتْ عَلَى<br>\
وَلَدِهَا, aor. as above, inf. n. عَطْفٌ, said of a she<br>\
camel, (assumed tropical:)  She became favourably inclined, or compassionate, towards her young one, and yielded<br>\
her milk; (Msb;) and عَلَيْهِ ↓ تعطّفت [signifies<br>\
the same, or she was made to incline to him, or to<br>\
affect him]. (M in art. رأم, &amp;c) ―<br>\
-b3-  عَطَفَ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
also signifies He turned, or returned, against<br>\
him: (S:) or he charged, or made an assault or<br>\
attack, upon him, [in battle,] and turned, or returned, against him: (O, K:) or he returned<br>\
against him with that which he disliked, or hated:<br>\
and to him with that which he desired. (L, referring to a verse of Aboo-Wejzeh Es-Saadee<br>\
cited in art. حين, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَطَفَ, aor. as<br>\
above, (TA,) inf. n. عَطْفٌ, (K, TA,) signifies<br>\
also He turned away, or back. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And [hence,] عَطَفَ عَنْهُ signifies (tropical:)  the contr. of<br>\
عَطَفَ عَلَيْهِ in the first of the senses assigned to<br>\
this latter above [i. e. it signifies (tropical:)  He was, or<br>\
became, averse from him; or disaffected, or unkind, to him; or unmerciful, unpitying, or uncompassionate, to him]. (MF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  عُطُوفٌ<br>\
and عَطْفٌ [as intrans. inf. ns.] also signify A<br>\
sheep&#39;s, or goat&#39;s, bending the neck, not by reason<br>\
of an ailment. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And عَطْفٌ [app. likewise as an intrans. inf. n.] also signifies The folding of the extremities of the skirt, of the facing,<br>\
or outer side, upon, or against, the lining, or inner<br>\
side. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَطَفَهُ, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) [aor. as<br>\
above,] inf. n. عَطْفٌ, (Mgh, Msb,) He inclined<br>\
it; (Mgh, Msb, TA;) namely, a thing; (Msb,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ استعطفهُ: (Mgh:) or he bent it,<br>\
or doubled it, or folded it: (Msb:) or it signifies<br>\
also he bent it: and ↓ عطّفهُ likewise, inf. n.<br>\
تَعْطِيفٌ, has both of these meanings: (TA:) or<br>\
this latter verb is with teshdeed to denote muchness [of the action], or multiplicity [of the objects]: (S, O, TA:) you say, عَطَفْتُ العُودَ (S) I<br>\
bent [or inclined] the stick, or piece of wood:<br>\
(MA, PS:) and العِيدَانَ ↓ عَطَّفْتُ [I bent, or inclined, the sticks, or pieces of wood]: (S, O:) and<br>\
زَأْسَ الخَشَبَةِ ↓ عَطَّفْتُ [I bent, or inclined, much,<br>\
the head of the piece of wood]. (TA.) One says<br>\
of a she-gazelle, تَعْطِفُ جِيدَهَا إِذَا رَبَضَتْ [She inclines, or bends, her neck when she lies down on her<br>\
breast]. (O, K.) And one says, عَطَفَ رَأْسَ<br>\
بَعِيرِهِ إِلَيْهِ He inclined, or bent, or turned aside,<br>\
the head of his camel towards him; inf. n. عَطْفٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and نَاقَتَهُ ↓ استعطف He turned aside his<br>\
she-camel (عَطَفَهَا) by pulling her nose-rein in<br>\
order that she should incline her head. (Mgh.)<br>\
And عَطَفَ الوِسَادَةَ, (S, O, K,) aor. and inf. n. as<br>\
above; (O;) and ↓ عَطَّفَهَا; (K;) He bent, or<br>\
doubled, or folded, the pillow, or cushion, (S, O,<br>\
K,) when leaning with his elbow upon it. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And [hence] one says, عَطَفَ اللّٰهُ بِقَلْبِ السُّلْطَانِ<br>\
عَلى رِعَيَّتهِ (assumed tropical:)  God made the heart of the Sultán, or<br>\
ruling power, to be favourably inclined towards<br>\
his subjects; to regard them, or treat them, with<br>\
mercy. (TA.) And عَطَفَتْكَ عَلَيْهِمُ الرَّحِمُ (assumed tropical:)  [The<br>\
feeling of relationship, or consanguinity, or the<br>\
sympathy of blood, caused, or hath caused, thee to<br>\

the she-camel to incline to, or affect, her young one].<br>\
(M in art. رأم; &amp;c.: see also لِقَاحٌ مُعَطَّفَةٌ in this<br>\
art.) And تُعْطَفُ عَلَى البَوِّ (assumed tropical:)  [She (a camel) is<br>\
made to incline to, or affect, the stuffed skin of a<br>\
young unweaned camel in order that she may<br>\
yield her milk, when her young one has died].<br>\
(S, O, [See عَطُوفٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَطَفْتُهُ عَنْ حَاجَتِهِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I turned him away, or back, from his object of<br>\
want. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَطْفُ المُدْمَجِ i. e. القِدْحِ<br>\
means The turning round about, or shuffling, of<br>\
the gaming-arrow. (S voce مُدْمَجٌ: see a verse<br>\
there cited.)<br>\

-A2-  عَطَّفْتُهُ,<br>\
ثَوْبِى, inf. n. تَعْطِيفٌ, I made my garment to be<br>\
to him an عِطَاف, (O, K, TA,) i. e. a رِدَآء, [by<br>\
putting it] upon his shoulders, as men do in the<br>\
[season of] heat. (TA.)<br>\

-b2-<br>\
[تعطّف also signifies He (a man) affected a bending of his body; like تَثَنَّى, with which it is<br>\
coupled in the S and O and K in art. غوج.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
تعطّف بِالعِطَافِ He clad himself (S, O, K *) with<br>\
the عِطَاف (O) [i. e.] with the رِدَآء; (S;) as also<br>\
بِهِ ↓ اعتطف. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, in<br>\
a trad., (TA,) in a prayer of the Prophet, (O,)<br>\
سُبْحَانَ مَنْ تَعَطَّفَ بِالْعِزِّ وَقَالَ بِهِ, (O, TA,) meaning (tropical:)  [I declare, or celebrate, or extol, the absolute<br>\
perfection] of Him who hath clad Himself with<br>\
might as with a رِدَآء [and (as expl. in the K in<br>\
art. قول and by Sgh) hath predominated thereby].<br>\
(IAth, TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تعاطفوا means عَطَفَ بَعْضُهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ [i. e.<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  They were, or became, favourably inclined, one<br>\
towards another; or affectionate, or kind, one to<br>\
another; &amp;c.: see 1]. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تعاطف<br>\
فِى مِشْيَتِهِ He (a man, Lth, O) shook, or moved<br>\

إِنْعَطَفَ see 1, first quarter, in two places.<br>\

-b2-  [Hence,] اعتطف القَوْسَ He hung<br>\
upon himself the bow, putting its suspensory belt or<br>\
cord upon his neck or shoulder; (IAar, TA;)<br>\
and so السَّيْفَ the sword. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استعطفهُ, (O, K,) or استعطفهُ عَلَيْهِ, (S,<br>\
[in which the meaning is indicated by the addition<br>\
of فَعَطَفَ,]) signifies سَأَلَهُ أَنْ يَعْطِفَ عَلَيْهِ [He<br>\
asked him to become favourably inclined towards<br>\
him; to be affectionate, or kind, to him; or to<br>\
regard him, or treat him, with mercy or pity or<br>\
compassion]: (O, K:) [or he sought, or endeavoured, to conciliate to him his affection, or good<br>\
will:] or اِسْتَعْطَفْتُهُ signifies سَأَلْتُهُ أَنْ يَنْعَطِفَ [I<br>\
asked him to incline, or bend: but perhaps ينعطف<br>\
is a mistranscription for يَعْطِفَ]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also 1, latter half, in two places.<br>\
عَطْفٌ: see the next paragraph, last sentence,<br>\
in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is used in grammar as<br>\
meaning Adjunction to an antecedent: this is of<br>\
two kinds; عَطْفُ البَيَانِ the explicative adjunction,<br>\
as in جَآءَ أَخُوكَ زَيْدٌ; and عَطْفُ النَّسَقِ the ordinal<br>\
adjunction, as in جَآءَ زَيْدٌ وَعَمْرٌو: (in each of<br>\
which instances the latter noun is termed ↓ مَعْطُوفٌ;<br>\
and the former noun عَلَيْهِ ↓ مَعْطُوفٌ:) and hence,<br>\
حَرْفُ عَطْفٍ, meaning a particle of adjunction; or<br>\
what we commonly call a conjunction; (as وَ<br>\
and ثُمَّ, &amp;c.;) also termed ↓ حَرْفٌ عَاطِفٌ an adjunctive particle.]<br>\
عِطْفٌ The side of a human being, from the head<br>\
to the hip, or to the foot: (Mgh:) and the side<br>\
of a thing: (Msb:) or the dual signifies the two<br>\
sides of a man, from the part next the head to the<br>\
hips: (S, O:) and the two sides of the neck of a<br>\
man: (TA:) and the two sides of anything: (S,<br>\
O, K:) as relating to a man, (TA,) or a thing.<br>\
(Msb,) the pl. is أَعْطَافٌ, [properly a pl. of pane.,]<br>\
(Msb, TA,) and, as relating to a man, عِطَافٌ<br>\
also, and عُطُوفٌ. (TA.) Hence the phrase, هُمْ<br>\
أَلْيَنُ عِطْفًا [They are more pliant, or pliable; properly as meaning flexible, supple, lithe, or limber;<br>\
but app. here used tropically, as meaning compliant: compare لَيِّنُ الجَانِبِ]. (Mgh.) And<br>\
لَيِّنُ الأَعْطَافِ [Pliant, or pliable, &amp;c.], applied to<br>\
a horse: (En-Nadr, TA voce غُوْجٌ: [see also<br>\
عَاجٌ, in art. عوج:]) and ↓ سَهْلُ المَعْطِفِ [and<br>\
↓ المَعَاطِفِ and الأَعْطَافِ, which signify the same,]<br>\
so applied. (S and O and TA voce غَوْجٌ.) And<br>\
[hence, also,] one says, ثَنَى عَنِّى عِطْفَهُ [lit. He bent<br>\
from me his side], meaning he turned away from<br>\
me. (S, O, K.) And جَآءَ ثَانِىَ عِطْفِهِ He came in<br>\
an unstraitened, or an easy, or a pleasant and<br>\
plentiful, state, or condition: (O, K:) or (K)<br>\
ثَانِىَ عِطْفِهِ in the Kur [xxii. 9] means (O) twisting, or bending, his neck: (O, K:) or (K) magnifying himself, or behaving proudly, and turning<br>\
away (O, K) from El-Islám. (O.) And فُلَانٌ<br>\
يَنْظُرُ فِى عِطْفَيْهِ [lit. Such a one looks at his sides],<br>\
meaning, is self-conceited. (IDrd, O, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also The armpit (Az, O, K, TA) of a man: and<br>\
his shoulder: pl. عُطُوفٌ. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
The curved part of each of the two extremities of<br>\
the bow; (O, K, TA;) the two being called its<br>\
عِطْفَانِ. (TA.) One says, تَعَوَّجَ القَوْسُ فِى عِطْفَيْهِ,<br>\
(O, TA,) in the copies of the K, تَعَرَّجَ الفَرَسُ فِى<br>\
عِطْفَيْهِ, but the former is the right, (TA,) meaning [The bow] bent to the right and left [in the two<br>\
curved parts of its extremities]. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
One says also, تَنَحَّ عَنْ عِطْفِ الطَّرِيقِ [i. e. Go<br>\
thou aside from] the beaten track of the road; as<br>\
also ↓ عَطْفِهِ: (IAar, O, K:) or ↓ عَطْفٌ signifies<br>\
a bending (Mgh, Msb) in a street (Mgh) or road,<br>\
(Msb,) being an inf. n. used as a simple subst.;<br>\
but the عِطْف in a street [or road] is [a bent part,<br>\
being] of the measure فِعْلٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولٌ. (Mgh. [See similar instances<br>\
voce ذِبْحٌ.])<br>\
عَطَفٌ: see عَطَفَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also Length of the edges<br>\
of the eyelids, (O, K, TA,) and a bending [app.<br>\
upwards] thereof: (TA:) occurring in a trad.:<br>\
or the word, as some relate it, is غَطَفٌ [q. v.];<br>\
(O, TA;) which is of higher authority. (TA.)<br>\
عَطْفَةٌ [as an inf. n. un.] An inclining: hence,<br>\
in a trad., كَأَنَّ عَطْفَتَهُمْ حِينَ سَمِعُوا صَوْتِى عَطْفَةُ<br>\
البَقَرِ عَلَى أَوْلَادِهَا [As though their inclining, when<br>\
they heard my voice, were the inclining of the cows<br>\
(app. meaning wild cows) towards their young<br>\
ones]. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And A certain bead by<br>\
means of which women captivate men; (S, O, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ عِطْفَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, (K,) or ↓ عَطَفَةٌ,<br>\
for which عَطْفَة is used by poetic license, (ISh<br>\
and O, [referring to a verse which will be found<br>\
at the close of this paragraph, in which verse,<br>\
however, it is certainly not used as applied to<br>\
what here immediately follows,]) A tree to which<br>\
the حَبْلَة [i. e. grape-vine, or branch of a grapevine,] clings; (ISh, O, K;) and so ↓ عِطْفَةٌ, (K,)<br>\
or thus as written in the “ Book of Plants ” by<br>\
AHn, who says that it is thus called because of<br>\
its bending and twining upon trees: (O: [but<br>\
this remark seems evidently to show that he<br>\
means thereby one of the plants mentioned below<br>\
voce عِطْفَةٌ or voce عَطَفَةٌ, or perhaps what here<br>\
follows:]) IB says that the عَطْفَة is the لَبْلَاب<br>\
[dolichos lablab of Linn.]; so called because of<br>\
its twining upon trees: (TA:) [and this, or what<br>\
will be found mentioned voce عَطَفَةٌ below, may<br>\
be meant in the following verse:] a poet says,<br>\
تَلَبَّسَ حُبُّهَا بِدَمِى وَلَحْمِى<br>\
تَلَبُّسَ عَطْفَةٍ بِفُرُوعِ ضَالِ<br>\
[The love of her mingled with, and clung to, my<br>\
blood and my flesh, like the mingling and clinging<br>\
of an عطفة with, and to, the branches of a wild<br>\
lote-tree]. (ISh, O, TA.)<br>\
عِطْفَةٌ: see عَطْفَةٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The<br>\
extremities [or tendrils] of the vine, that hang<br>\

-b3-  And The tree [or plant]<br>\
called عُصْبَة [n. un. of عُصْبٌ, q. v., said by some<br>\
to signify the لَيْلَاب, mentioned in the next preceding paragraph]. (K.)<br>\
عَطَفَةٌ A certain plant which twines upon trees<br>\
and has no leaves nor branches, fed upon by the<br>\
oxen [app. meaning the wild oxen,] (K, TA,) but<br>\
injurious to them: (TA:) some of its عُرُوق [app.<br>\
here meaning root-like stalks] are taken, and<br>\
twisted, and charmed [by some invocation or<br>\
otherwise], and cast upon the woman that hates<br>\
her husband, and she consequently loves him:<br>\
(K, TA:) so they assert: (TA:) accord. to AA,<br>\
↓ عَطَفٌ signifies one of the strange kinds of trees<br>\
of the desert: (O, TA:) عَطَفَةٌ is the n. un. thereof.<br>\
(TA.) See also عَطْفَةٌ.<br>\
قَوْسٌ عَطْفَى: see مَعْطُوفٌ.<br>\
عَطْفَآءُ [as an epithet applied to a شَاة, i. e. sheep<br>\
or goat,] Having the horn twisted; like عَقْصَآءُ:<br>\
occurring in a trad. relating to the poor-rate.<br>\

kinds called] a رِدَآء (S, O, K) and a طَيْلَسَان, and<br>\
any garment that is worn like as is the رِدَآء, (TA,)<br>\
and the former also signifies an إِزَار: (K:) the<br>\
two words are like إِزَارٌ and مِئْزَرٌ, &amp;c.: and the<br>\
ردآء is said to be called عطاف because it falls<br>\
against the two sides of the man&#39;s neck, which<br>\
are termed his عِطْفَانِ: the pl. [of pauc.] of عِطَافٌ<br>\
is أَعْطِفَةٌ and [of mult.] عُطُفٌ and عُطُوفٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and عُطْفٌ [also] is a pl. of عِطَافٌ as meaning an<br>\
إِزَار: (K, TA:) the pl. of ↓ مِعْطَفٌ is مَعَاطِفُ;<br>\
but As says that he had not heard any sing. of<br>\
this pl. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (S, O, TA,) عِطَافٌ<br>\
signifies also A sword; (S, O, K, TA;) because<br>\
the Arabs called it [in like manner] رِدَآءٌ [q. v.];<br>\
(TA;) and so ↓ مِعْطَفٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And one says,<br>\
السَّيْفُ عِطَافِى وَإِبَاطِى, meaning I put, or place,<br>\
the sword upon my side, and beneath my armpit.<br>\
(TA in art. ابط.)<br>\

That inclines towards, or upon, the other arrows<br>\
[in the receptacle called the رِبَابَة], and comes forth<br>\
winning, or before the others: [app. because it is<br>\

ex. of the former occurs in a verse of Sakhr-el-Gheí cited in art. خض: (O, TA:) [in the TA,<br>\
in art. خوض, it is expl. as meaning, in that verse,<br>\
a borrowed arrow, in the luck of which one has<br>\
confidence:] or the former, accord. to El-Kutabee, (O,) or each, (K,) signifies the arrow to<br>\
which is assigned no fine and no gain; (O, K;)<br>\
it is one of the three أَغْفَال; and is called عطوف<br>\
because it returns into every رِبَابَة with which one<br>\
plays; and El-Kutabee says that قِدْحًا عَطُوفَا in<br>\
the verse of Sakhr is a sing. in a pl. sense: (O:)<br>\
or, (O, K,) accord. to Skr, (O,) عَطُوفٌ signifies<br>\
that comes [forth] (يَرِدُ, so in the O, in the copies<br>\
of the K يُرَدُّ, [which would make this explanation<br>\
virtually the same as the one immediately following it,]) time after time: or that is repeated, [i. e.<br>\
repeatedly put into the رِبَابَة and drawn forth from<br>\
it,] time after time: and ↓ عَطَّافٌ signifies a<br>\
gaming arrow that turns aside from the places<br>\
whence the [other] arrows are taken (عَنْ مَآخِذِ<br>\
القِدَاحِ [for which the CK has على مأخَذِ القِداحِ]),<br>\
and becomes alone, by itself. (O, K.) ―<br>\

affectionate, or kind; and to show mercy or pity<br>\
or compassion. (O.) (assumed tropical:)  A bestower of favour, or<br>\
bounty; good in disposition; as also ↓ عَاطِفٌ;<br>\
(TA;) of both of which عُطْفٌ is pl.; (K, TA;)<br>\
and ↓ عَطَّافٌ also has this meaning, applied to a<br>\
man: (Lth, TA:) and also this last, and عَطُوفٌ,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  a man who protects, or defends, those who are<br>\
defeated, or put to flight. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  A woman<br>\
loving to her husband, affectionate to her child or<br>\

عَطِيفَةٌ and ↓ عِطَافَةٌ A bow: pl. عَطَائِفُ. (TA.)<br>\
عَطَّافٌ: see عَطُوفٌ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  العَطَّافُونَ<br>\
