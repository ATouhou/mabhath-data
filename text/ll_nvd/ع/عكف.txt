عَكَفَ عَلَيْهِ, aor.<br>\
عَكُفَ and<br>\
عَكِفَ, [the former, only,<br>\
mentioned in the Mgh, and only the latter in the<br>\
CK,] inf. n. عُكُوفٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and عَكْفٌ,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) or the latter is of the trans. verb, (T,<br>\
TA,) He kept, or clave, to it constantly, or perseveringly; (S, Mgh, * O, Msb, K, TA;) namely,<br>\
a thing; (S, O, Msb;) not turning his face from<br>\
it: or, as some say, he continued intent upon it:<br>\
(TA:) and, accord. to Er-Rázee, عَلَيْهِ ↓ اعتكف<br>\
would be agreeable with analogy, in the sense of<br>\
عَكَفَ عليه, but has not been heard. (Har p. 682.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [vii. 134], يَعْكُفُونَ عَلَى أَصْنَامٍ<br>\
لَهُمْ, (S, * O, TA,) or يَعْكِفُونَ, accord. to different readers, (O, TA,) i. e. A people keeping, or<br>\
cleaving, constantly, or perseveringly, to the<br>\
worship of idols belonging to them; (Ksh;)<br>\
or continuing intent upon the worship of idols<br>\
belonging to them. (Bd, Jel.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عُكُوفٌ<br>\
[or عُكُوفٌ فِى مَكَانٍ] signifies The keeping, or<br>\
cleaving, to a place. (TA.) See also 8. ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
one says, عَكَفَتِ الخَيْلُ بِقَائِدِهَا meaning أَقْبَلَتْ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
[i. e. The horses, or horsemen, (for the latter may<br>\
be meant notwithstanding the fem. pronoun,<br>\
agreeably with an ex. in De Sacy&#39;s Gram., sec.<br>\
ed., ii. 265,) advanced, or approached, towards<br>\
their leader; or kept, or clave, to him]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And عَكَفُوا حَوْلَهُ They went round it; (S, O,<br>\
K;) namely, a thing. (S, O.) El-&#39;Ajjáj says,<br>\
*عَكْفَ النَّبِيطِ يَلْعَبُونَ الفَنْزَجَا<br>\
[Like the going round of the Nabathæans playing<br>\
the game called فَنْزضج: in which عَكْفَ is probably<br>\
used by poetic license for عُكُوفَ]. (S, O.) And<br>\
in like manner one says, عَكَفَتِ الطَّيْرُ عَلَى القَتِيلِ,<br>\
(O,) or حَوْلَ القَتِيلِ, (K,) [The birds went round<br>\
the slain person], inf. n. عُكُوفٌ. (TA.) And<br>\
عَكَفَ الجَوْهَرُ فِى النَّظْمِ (S, O, K) i. e. [The gems]<br>\
went round [among the strung beads]. (O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And عَكَفَ signifies also تَأَخَّرَ [He went back<br>\
or backwards, &amp;c.; or became, or remained, behind; &amp;c.]. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  عَكَفَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَكُفَ and<br>\
عَكِفَ, [the<br>\
former, only, mentioned in the Mgh, and only<br>\
the latter in the CK,] inf. n. عَكْفٌ, (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) He, or it, made him, or it, still, or motionless: (S, O:) and he, or it, detained, withheld,<br>\
or debarred, him, or it; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ عكّفهُ, (O, * TA,) inf. n. تَعْكِيفٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and so عَكَفَ بِهِ. (Har p. 293.) One says, عَكَفْتُهُ<br>\
عَنْ حَاجَتِهِ, (Msb,) aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
(TA,) I withheld him from the object of his want:<br>\
(Msb:) or I turned him away, or back, therefrom. (TA.) And مَا عَكَفَكَ عَنْ كَذَا [What has<br>\
withheld thee, or turned thee away or back, from<br>\
such a thing?]. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2. ―<br>\
-b3-  عَكَفَ,<br>\
(O, K,) inf. n. عَكْفٌ, (O,) also signifies رَعَى [app.<br>\
as trans., meaning He tended, or pastured, cattle;<br>\
&amp;c.]. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And i. q. أَصْلَحَ [He put into<br>\
a good, sound, right, or proper, state; &amp;c.].<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
عَكَّفَ see 1, last quarter. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says, عكّف<br>\
السِّلْكُ السُّمُوطَ i. e. [The thread of the necklace]<br>\
kept from becoming scattered [the things suspended<br>\
therefrom]. (O, from a verse of El-Aashà.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And عُكِّفَ النَّظْمُ, inf. n. تَعْكِيفٌ, The strung beads<br>\
had gems disposed in regular order (نُضِّدَ, Lth, O,<br>\
or نُظِمَ, K) among them. (Lth, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
عُكِّفَ الشَّعَرُ The hair was crisped, curled, or<br>\
twisted, and contracted. (O, K.) And عكّفت<br>\
شَعَرَهَا She (a woman) made her hair to cleave<br>\
together, one part to another, and disposed it in<br>\
plaits; as also ↓ عَكَفَتْهُ; (Ham p. 267;) but, accord. to Lth, they seldom said عَكَفَ in relation to<br>\
hair that is termed مَعْكُوف, i. e. “ combed and<br>\
plaited,” though, if this were said, it would be<br>\
correct. (O.)<br>\
3<br>\
عاكف, accord. to Reiske, as mentioned by<br>\
Freytag, (app. followed by an accus.,) signifies<br>\
He clave continually to the side of any one.]<br>\
5<br>\
تعكّف He confined, restrained, withheld, or<br>\
debarred, himself; (O, K;) as also ↓ اعتكف: one<br>\
should not say ↓ انعكف. (K.)<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْعَكَفَ see what next precedes.<br>\
8<br>\
إِعْتَكَفَ see 1, first sentence: and see also 5. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
اعتكف, (Mgh, O, Msb, K, *) or اعتكف فِى المَسْجِدِ,<br>\
(S, O, * K, *) and فِيهِ ↓ عَكَفَ, signify the same,<br>\
(O, K,) i. e. He secluded himself, (S, O, TA,) or<br>\
remained, (Mgh, TA,) in the mosque, or place of<br>\
worship, (S, Mgh, O, TA,) performing a particular sort of religious service, with the observance<br>\
of certain conditions, (Mgh,) [during a period of<br>\
days and nights, or at least during one whole day,<br>\
fasting from daybreak to sunset, and occupying<br>\
himself in prayer and religious meditation, without<br>\
any interruption by affairs distracting the mind<br>\
from devotion and not pressing,] not going forth<br>\
therefrom except for human necessity: (TA:)<br>\
اِعْتِكَافٌ is thus termed because it is the withholding oneself from the customary exercises of freedom<br>\
of action in the disposal, or management, of affairs. (Msb.)<br>\
عَكِفٌ Crisp, curly, or twisted, and contracted,<br>\
hair. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
عَاكِفٌ Keeping, or cleaving, constantly, or perseveringly, [عَلَى شَىْءٍ to a thing, and فِى مَكَانٍ in<br>\
a place:] (S, O: *) or continuing intent [upon a<br>\
thing]: and remaining, staying, dwelling, or<br>\
abiding, in a place: (O:) pl. عَاكِفُونَ and عُكُوفٌ<br>\
(O, K, TA) and عُكَّفٌ. (TA.) One says, فُلَانٌ<br>\
عَاكِفٌ عَلَى فَرْجٍ حَرَامٍ [Such a one is keeping, or<br>\
cleaving, constantly, or perseveringly, to an unlawful فَرْج]. (S, O.)<br>\
مُعَكَّفٌ Bent, crooked, contorted, or distorted.<br>\
(TA.) [See also مُعَقَّفٌ.]<br>\
مَعْكُوفٌ Made still, or motionless: and detained,<br>\
withheld, or debarred. (S, O.) Hence مَعْكُوفًا in<br>\
the Kur [xlviii. 25], (S, O,) meaning Being detained, or withheld; (Mgh, TA;) as expl. by<br>\
Mujáhid and &#39;Atà. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Hair combed<br>\
and plaited. (O, K.) [See also مَعْقُوفٌ, voce<br>\
مُعَقَّفٌ.]<br>\
مُعْتَكَفٌ A man&#39;s place of اِعْتِكَاف [or self-seclusion in a mosque or the like: see 8]. (TA.)<br>\
