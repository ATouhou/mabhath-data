(O, TA,) i. e. disposed him, (TA,) to do a good<br>\

going along quickly: (TA:) or عَسَلَانٌ signifies<br>\

wealth: I will assuredly not be, with my mode of<br>\
praising, like a hewer, one day, of a rock with a<br>\
hair-broom, or a feather, of a seller of perfumes]:<br>\
he means, كَنَاحِتِ صَخْرَةٍ يَوْمًا, this last word intervening between the prefixed noun and its complement because the noun of time is held by them<br>\
to be like what is redundant. (S, O, TA. [One<br>\
of my copies of the S has أَكُونًا; the O, اَكُونَا:<br>\
