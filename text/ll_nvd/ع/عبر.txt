عَبُرَ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\

one side thereof to the other; (Msb, K;) namely,<br>\
a river, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, *) and a valley,<br>\

Msb, K:) as though he travelled the road of<br>\
life: or, as F says in the B, as though he crossed<br>\

mentally, (A,) the book, or writing, not raising<br>\
his voice in doing so, (As, S, A, O, K,) i. e. in<br>\
reading it. (K.) And you say, بَعْضَ ↓ اِعْتَبَرَ<br>\
الكِتَابِ بِبَعْضٍ, meaning عَبَرَهُ [i. e. He considered<br>\

them to be a thousand. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also 8,<br>\
second sentence.<br>\
-A3-  عَبِرَ, with kesr, aor.<br>\
عَبَرَ, inf. n.<br>\
عَبَرٌ; (S;) or عَبَرَ, inf. n. عَبْرٌ; (K;) [but the<br>\
former seems to be the more correct, as will be<br>\
seen from what follows;] and ↓ استعبر; (A, O,<br>\
K;) He shed tears; his eyes, or eye, watered.<br>\
(S, A, K, TA.) And عَبِرَتْ عَيْنُهُ His eye shed<br>\

-A2-  عبّر الرُّؤْيَا, (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. as above; (S, O;) and ↓ عَبَرَهَا, (S,<br>\
A, O, Msb, K,) [which is less common, but more<br>\
chaste,] aor.<br>\

and عَبْرٌ; (A, Msb, K;) He interpreted, or explained, the dream, (S, A, O, Msb, K,) and told its<br>\
final sequel or result: (A, O, K:) or the former<br>\
verb has an intensive signification: (Msb:) and<br>\
تَعْبِيرٌ has a more particular [or more restricted]<br>\
meaning than تَأْوِيلٌ: it is said to be from عَبَرَ<br>\
الكِتَابَ [q. v.]; or, as some say, it is from عِبْرٌ<br>\
signifying the “ side ” of a river, because the interpreter of the dream considers the two sides<br>\
thereof, and meditates upon every particular of it<br>\
from its beginning to its end. (TA.) In the<br>\
phrase of the Kur [xii. 43], إِنْ كُنْتُمْ لِلرُّؤْيَا<br>\
↓ تَعْبُرُونَ, the ل is termed لَامُ التَّعْقِيبِ [the ل of<br>\
succedaneousness], because it is succedaneous to<br>\
the connection termed إِضَافَة [i. e. the phrase is<br>\
succedaneous to إِنْ كُنْتُمْ عَابِرِى الرُّؤْيَا If ye be<br>\
interpreters of the dream]: (O, TA:) or it is<br>\
inserted as an explicative: (Zj, TA:) the phrase<br>\
is similar to إِنْ كُنْتَ لِلْمَالِ جَامِعًا. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
عبّر عَمَّا فِى نَفْسِهِ, (A, K, TA,) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(TA,) He declared, spoke out clearly or plainly,<br>\
or explained, what was in his mind. (A, * K, *<br>\
TA.) And اللِّسَانُ يُعَبِّرُ عَمَّا فِى الضَّمِيرِ The tongue<br>\
declares, or explains, what is in the mind. (S, *<br>\
O, * Msb) And عبّر عَنْهُ غَيْرُهُ Another spoke, or<br>\
spoke out, or explained, for him; (L, K, * TA;)<br>\
he (the latter) being unable to say what he<br>\
would. (L, TA.) And عَبَّرْتُ عَنْ فُلَانٍ I spoke<br>\
for such a one. (S, O, Msb.) [Hence, يُعَبِّرُ<br>\
عَنْ كَذَا, said of a word or phrase, It expresses<br>\
the meaning of, signifies, or denotes, such a thing.<br>\
And يُعَبَّرُ بِهِ عَنْ كَذَا The meaning of such a<br>\
thing is expressed thereby; or such a thing is signified, or denoted, thereby.] ―<br>\
-b3-  عبّر الدَّنَانِيرَ, (A,)<br>\
or الذَّهَبَ, (K,) inf. n. as above, (A, K,) He<br>\
weighed the deenárs, (A,) or the gold, (K,) deenár<br>\
by deenár: (A, K:) or عبّرهُ signifies he weighed<br>\
it (a thing), or measured it, without extraordinary<br>\
care: (K, * TA:) and تَعْبِيرُ الدَّرَاهِمِ, the weighing<br>\
of the dirhems collectively, after making divisions<br>\
of them. (S, O, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  عبّر بِهِ, (K, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
as above, (TA,) signifies أَرَاهُ عُبْرَ عَيْنِهِ (K, TA,<br>\
in the CK عَيْنَيْهِ,) i. e. He showed him what<br>\
would make his eye to weep: or what would make<br>\
his eye hot. (TA.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says,<br>\
عَلَى مَلَقِيَّاتٍ يُعَبِّرْنَ بالغُفْرِ<br>\
[Upon swiftly-running mares that show the mountain kids, in the swiftness of their pace, what<br>\
makes their eyes to weep from envy]. (TA.)<br>\
And you say also, عبّر عَيْنَيْهِ, meaning He made<br>\
his eyes to weep. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He destroyed<br>\
him: (K, TA:) as though he showed him what<br>\
would make his eye to weep, or make it hot.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He caused him to fall into difficulty, or distress. (A.) And It (an affair, or<br>\
event,) was, or became, difficult, or distressing, to<br>\
him. (O, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
اعتبر He became admonished, or reminded;<br>\
he took warning, or example: in this sense the<br>\
verb is used in the Kur lix. 2: and you say,<br>\
اِعْتَبَرَ بِمَا مَضَى He became admonished or reminded, or he took warning or example, by what<br>\
passed: (Msb:) and السَّعِيدُ مِنَ اعْتَبَرَ بِغَيْرِهِ<br>\
وَالشَّقِىُّ مَنِ اعْتَبَرَ بِهِ غَيْرُهُ [The fortunate is he who<br>\
takes warning by others, and the unfortunate is<br>\
he by whom others take warning]. (Kull p. 60.)<br>\
And عَبَرٌ [as inf. n. of ↓ عَبِرَ, aor.<br>\
عَبَرَ,] signifies the<br>\
same as اِعْتِبَارٌ [as inf. n. of اِعْتَبَرَ in the sense expl.<br>\
above]: (Fr, O, L, K, TA:) whence the saying<br>\
of the Arabs, اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْنَا مِمَّنْ يَعْبَرُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَا<br>\
يَعْبُرُهَا, (Fr, O, L, TA,) with fet-h to the ب of<br>\
يعبر in the first case, and with damm to it in the<br>\
second case, (TA,) meaning O God, make us to<br>\
be of those who take warning, or example, by the<br>\
present world, and do not [pass through it or] die<br>\
quickly, or soon, until they content Thee by<br>\
obedience: (Fr, O, L, TA:) in the copies of the<br>\
K, مِمَّنْ يَعْبُرُ الدُّنْيَا وَلَا يَعْمُرُهَا, the former verb<br>\
with ب [and damm], and the latter with م [and<br>\
damm]: and in the A is given, as a trad., اُعْبُرُوا<br>\
الدُّنْيَا وَلَا تَعْمُرُوهَا: but the reading given by Sgh<br>\
and in the L is pronounced by MF to be the<br>\
right. (TA.) See also عِبْرَةٌ. [And see 10, last<br>\
sentence.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He took, or regarded, what<br>\
he witnessed, or saw, or beheld, as an indication,<br>\
or evidence, of what was concealed from him:<br>\
(O:) he compared what was unapparent with<br>\
what was apparent [and so judged of the former<br>\
from analogy]: or he considered the essential<br>\
properties of things, and their modes of indication,<br>\
in order that, by the consideration thereof, another<br>\
thing, of their kind, might become known. (Kull<br>\
p. 60.) See, again, عِبْرَةٌ. Ibn-Seereen used to<br>\
say, أَعْتَبِرُ الحَدِيثَ [I judge by comparison with<br>\
what has been transmitted by tradition from the<br>\
Prophet]; meaning I interpret a dream according to what has been transmitted by tradition,<br>\
like as I do according to the Kur-án; as when a<br>\
crow is interpreted as meaning an unrighteous<br>\
man, and a rib as meaning a woman, in imitation of forms of speech used by the Prophet.<br>\
(O, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 1, latter half, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b4-  Also He accounted, or esteemed, or<br>\
regarded, a thing, in respect of predicamental<br>\
order. (Msb.) See, again, عِبْرَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b5-  [And He<br>\
esteemed a person, or thing; held him, or it, in<br>\
high estimation or regard. ―<br>\
-b6-  And He took a<br>\
thing into account, regarded it, or included it in a<br>\
mental view or an examination. Hence the<br>\
phrase بِاعْتِبَارِ كَذَا With regard, or respect, or<br>\
with regard had, to such a thing; in consideration<br>\
of such a thing, or of the implication thereof;<br>\
and having regard, or respect, to such a thing;<br>\
as also اِعْتِبَارًا لِكَذَا and بِكَذَا. And بِاعْتِبَارٍ وَاحِدٍ<br>\
Considered in one respect; in one and the same<br>\
light. Hence also the phrase,] يُعْتَبَرُ كَذَا لِصِحَّةِ<br>\
العَقْدِ Such a thing is made a condition [or is taken<br>\
into account] for the soundness, or validity, of the contract. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b7-  اعتبر مِنْهُ means He wondered<br>\
at him, or it. (K, TA. In the CK, منه is<br>\
omitted.)<br>\
10<br>\
استعبر [He desired to cross, go across, or<br>\
pass over, a river or the like. (See الغُمَيْصَآءُ.)]<br>\
-A2-  استعبرهُ الرُّؤْيَا He asked him to interpret, or<br>\
explain, the dream; (K;) he related to him the<br>\
dream in order that he might interpret, or explain,<br>\
it. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  لَقَدْ أَسْرَعْتَ اسْتِعْبَارَكَ الدَّرَاهِمَ is a<br>\
saying mentioned by As as meaning [Assuredly<br>\
thou hast hastened] thy drawing forth of the dirhems. (O.)<br>\
-A3-  See also 1, last quarter, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Accord. to Golius, استعبر is also syn.<br>\
with اعتبر in the first of the senses assigned to<br>\
the latter above; but for this I do not find any<br>\
authority.]<br>\
عَبْرٌ: see عِبْرٌ.<br>\
-A2-  عَبْرُ أَسْفَارٍ and عَبْرُ سَفَرٍ: see<br>\
what here follows.<br>\
عُبْرُ أَسْفَارٍ and اسفارٍ ↓ عِبْرُ (S, K) and اسفار ↓ عَبْرُ<br>\
(K) and عُبْرُ سَفَرٍ and سفرٍ ↓ عِبْرُ and سفرٍ ↓ عَبْرُ (TA)<br>\
A he-camel, and a she-camel, and camels, like a<br>\
ship [or ships], i. e. upon which journeys are continually made: (S:) or a she-camel that is strong<br>\
(K, TA) to journey, (TA,) [as though] cutting.<br>\
or furrowing, what she passes over, (K, TA,) and<br>\
upon which journeys are made: (TA:) and likewise a man (K, TA) bold to undertake journeys,<br>\
vigorous and effective therein, and strong to make<br>\
them: and in like manner a he-camel, and camels:<br>\
(TA:) applied to a sing. and to a pl. (K, TA)<br>\
and to a fem.: (TA:) and in like manner also<br>\
↓ عَبَّارٌ, applied to a he-camel, (K,) meaning strong<br>\
(O, TA) to journey; and so ↓ عِبَارٌ, with kesr,<br>\
[app. pl. of عَبْرٌ,] applied to camels. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence one says, لِكُلِّ عَمَلٍ ↓ إِنَّ فُلَانًا عِبْرٌ Verily<br>\
such a one is fit, and sufficiently strong, for every<br>\
work. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence likewise] عُبْرٌ signifies<br>\
Clouds that travel, or pass along, vehemently<br>\
[or quickly]. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also عِبْرٌ.<br>\
-A3-  And عُبْرٌ<br>\
and ↓ عَبَرٌ (S, O, K. TA, in the CK عُبْرَة and عَبَرَة,)<br>\
and ↓ عُبُرٌ signify A weeping with grief: (TA:)<br>\
or heat in the eye, causing it to weep: (S, O:) or<br>\

his mother have weeping with grief: (TA:) or<br>\

CK عَيْنَيْهِ,) He showed him what would make his<br>\
eye to weep: or what would make his eye hot.<br>\
(TA.) And رَأَى فُلَانٌ عُبْرَ عَيْنَيْهِ Such a one saw<br>\
what made his eyes hot. (S, O.) And إِنَّهُ لَيَنْظُرُ<br>\
إِلَى عُبْرِ عَيْنَيْهِ Verily he looks at that which he dislikes, or hates, and at which he weeps. (A.) And<br>\
the phrase وَعُبْرُ جَارَتِهَا occurs in the trad. of UmmZara, meaning And, by reason of her chastity and<br>\
beauty, a cause of weeping to her fellow-wife. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  عُبْرٌ also signifies Women bereft of their children<br>\
by death; syn. ثَكْلَى: (K, TA:) as though pl. of<br>\
عَابِرٌ. (TA.)<br>\

[Its waves casting foam upon the two banks].<br>\

-b2-  See<br>\
also عُبْرٌ, in two places: ―<br>\
-b3-  and عَبْرَةٌ.<br>\
عَبِرٌ; and its fem., with ة; see عَابِرٌ.<br>\

and of the last, the following is an ex.:<br>\
لَكَ مَا أَبْكِى وَلَا عَبْرَةَ بِى<br>\
or, as some relate it, ولا عبرة لِى; and the meaning<br>\
is, For thy sake I weep, but there is grief in me<br>\
for myself: so says As: (TA:) or in this saying, which is a prov., ما may be redundant, or it<br>\
may be what is termed مَصْدَرِيَّة; and the meaning<br>\
is, For thee I weep, or for thee is my weeping, I<br>\

عِبْرَةٌ a subst. from الاِعْتِبَارُ; An admonition, or<br>\

thorns [that hurt] being of the سِدْر called ضال:<br>\
he does not say, as others do, that it is that<br>\
which grows upon the water: some assert that<br>\
it is also called عُمْرِىٌّ, the ب being changed into<br>\
م: (O:) or, as some say, such as has no trunk;<br>\
and such is only of those that are near to the عِبْر<br>\

of the desert, and is the ضال: AZ says that the<br>\
