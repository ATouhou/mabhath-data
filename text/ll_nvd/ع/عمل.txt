عَمِلَ, aor.<br>\
عَمَلَ, inf. n. عَمَلٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
He worked, or wrought; laboured; served, or<br>\
did service: he did, acted, or performed: (K,<br>\
TA:) [generally, he did, &amp;c., with a sort of difficulty, or with intention; but sometimes said of<br>\
an inanimate thing: (see عَمَلٌ, below:)] he did,<br>\
or he made, wrought, manufactured, or constructed, a thing. (Msb. [See, again, عَمَلٌ,<br>\
below.]) Accord. to Az, عَمِلَ is the only trans.<br>\
verb of its measure having the inf. n. of the<br>\
measure فَعَلٌ, except هَبِلَت, said of a mother,<br>\
inf. n. هَبَلٌ; other similar verbs having the<br>\
inf. n. of the measure فَعْلٌ; as سَرِطْتُ اللُّقْمَةَ,<br>\
inf. n. سَرْطٌ; and بَلِعْتُهُ, inf. n. بَلْعٌ. (TA. [But<br>\
see arts. سرط and بلع; with respect to the former<br>\
of which I must here state that, since it was<br>\
printed, I have found an authority for سَرْطٌ as<br>\
inf. n. of سَرِطَ in a copy of the S; though in the<br>\
K it is said to be مُحَرَّكَة, and accord. to the Msb<br>\
it is like تَعَبٌ.]) You say, عَمِلْتُ عَلَى الصَّدَقَةِ I<br>\
officiated in the collecting of the poor-rate. (Msb.)<br>\
[And عَمِلَ بِمَا فِى كِتَابِ اللّٰهِ He did according to<br>\
what is enjoined in the Book of God.] And<br>\
عَمِلَ فِى هَلَاكِهِ [He laboured to destroy him, or<br>\
to kill him]. (K in art. شيط.) [And عَمِلَ فِيهِ<br>\
It acted upon him, or it: and, said of a sword<br>\
&amp;c., it had effect, or made an impression, upon<br>\
him, or it.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] عَمِلَ فِيهِ signifies [also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  It governed it syntactically; or caused it to be<br>\
مَرْفُوع or مَنْصُوب or مَجْرُور &amp;c.; i. e.] it produced<br>\
in it a certain species of syntactical desinence.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَمِلَ البَرْقُ The lightning was continual. (K.) And عَمِلَتْ بِأُذُنَيْهَا, said of a she-camel, (K,) and also, in a trad., of [the beast]<br>\
البُرَاق, (O, * TA,) She went quickly, or swiftly;<br>\
(O, K, TA;) because she that does thus puts her<br>\
ears in motion by reason of the vehemence of the<br>\
pace. (TA.) And عَمِلَت [alone] said of a she-camel, signifies [the same: or] She was, or became, brisk, light, active, or quick. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
[hence, app.,] لَمْ أَرَ النَّفَقَةَ تَعْمَلُ كَمَا تَعْمَلُ بِمَكَّةَ, a<br>\
saying mentioned by Lh, is expl. by ISd as<br>\
meaning تَنْفَقُ [i. e. I have not seen the money that<br>\
that one expends pass away as it passes away in<br>\
Mekkeh]. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
عَمَّلْتُ فُلَانًا عَلَى البَصْرَةِ, (S, O,) or عَلَى البَلَدِ,<br>\

such a one governor (S, O, Msb) over El-Basrah,<br>\
(S, O,) or over the province, or city, &amp;c. (Msb.)<br>\
And عُمِّلَ فُلَانٌ عَلَيْهِمْ, inf. n. as above, Such a<br>\
one was made, or appointed, governor over them.<br>\
(K, TA.) And one says, مَنَ الَّذِى عُمِّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ<br>\
Who is he that has been set up as governor over<br>\
you? (TA.) And فُلَانٌ ↓ اُسْتُعْمِلَ [Such a one<br>\
was employed as governor over a people: (see a<br>\
saying of &#39;Omar in art. ضعف, conj. 2:) or] such<br>\
a one was appointed to one of the sovereign&#39;s offices<br>\
of government. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عمّلهُ, (Mgh, O,<br>\
K,) inf. n. as above, (K,) He gave him his عُمَالَة,<br>\

or transacted business, with him. Hence,] He<br>\
dealt with him in buying and selling, (Msb, KL,)<br>\
and the like: so in the language of the people of<br>\
the cities. (Msb.) See also 6. [And hence the<br>\
saying, عاملهُ مُعَامَلَةَ اللَّيْثِ (mentioned in the S<br>\
in art. ليث) He did, acted, or dealt, with him in<br>\
the manner of the lion.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. سَامَهُ بِعَمَلٍ<br>\
[He made to him an offer of working, mentioning<br>\
the rate of payment; or bargained, or contracted,<br>\
with him for work]. (K.) Sgh says that المُعَامَلَةُ<br>\

is termed in the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz<br>\
المُسَاقَاةُ, (Msb,) which is The employing a man to<br>\
take upon himself, or manage, the culture&#39; [or<br>\

of their produce. (S and TA in art. سقى.)<br>\
4<br>\
اعملهُ He made him to work, labour, serve,<br>\
or do service; or to do, act, or perform; (S, * O, *<br>\
K, TA;) as also ↓ استعملهُ: (S, K:) he made<br>\
him, or caused him, to do, or to make, manufacture, or construct, a thing. (Msb.) And one<br>\
says also, يُعْمِلُ نَفْسَهُ فِى الأَمْرِ [He plies himself<br>\
in the affair]. (S in art. عسم.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,]<br>\
He worked with it, [i. e. employed it, or used it,<br>\
or plied it,] namely, his judgment, or opinion,<br>\
and [properly] his instrument, or implement, (K,<br>\
TA,) and his tongue; (TA;) as also ↓ استعملهُ.<br>\

things with his intellect, or understanding. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And أَعْمَلْتُ النَّاقَةَ [I hastened, and urged, the<br>\
she-camel]: whence the saying, in a trad., لَا تُعْمَلُ<br>\
المَطِىُّ إِلَّا إِلَى ثَلَاثَةِ مَسَاجِدَ, meaning [The camels<br>\
that are used for riding] shall not be hastened nor<br>\
urged [or plied, save to three mosques; that of<br>\
Mekkeh, that of El-Medeeneh, and that of ElAksà at Jerusalem: see also a variation of this<br>\
saying in the first paragraph of art. ضرب; and<br>\

يُعْمِلُ النَّاقَةَ وَالسَّاقَ [He hastens, and urges, the she-camel and the shank], meaning he is strong to journey, riding and walking. (TA.) ―<br>\

guarding, and the like, from their own property.<br>\
(IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And اعتملهُ signifies also He employed him, or used him, for work, or service;<br>\
like استعملهُ: but is perhaps post-classical.]<br>\
10<br>\
استعملهُ He asked, required, or desired,<br>\
him to work, labour, do service, or act, (S, O,<br>\
Msb, * TA,) for him. (TA.) [And استعمل, app.<br>\
for استعمل نَفْسَهُ, He desired to act: see an ex.<br>\
in art. روى conj. 2.] ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 4, in two places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And see 2. One says also, اُسْتُعْمِلَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى<br>\
الجَالَّةِ [Such a one was employed as collecter of<br>\
the poll-tax]. (S and Msb in art. جل. See also<br>\
a similar ex. voce ضِحٌّ.) And اِسْتَعْمَلْتُ الثَّوْبَ I<br>\
made the garment to serve [i. e. made use of it]<br>\
for clothing. (Msb.) And اِسْتَعْمَلْتُ اللَّبِنَ [I<br>\
made use of the bricks], meaning I built with the<br>\
bricks a building. (Msb.) And استعمل البَلَهَ<br>\
[He feigned heedlessness, &amp;c.; or made use of it<br>\
as a mask, or pretext]. (K in explanation of<br>\
تَبَالَهَ and تَبَلَّهَ. See also a similar ex. voce تَحَلَّمَ.)<br>\
عَمَلٌ [mentioned in the beginning of this art.<br>\
as an inf. n.] is syn. with مَِهْنَةٌ and فِعْلٌ: (K:)<br>\
[accordingly, when used as a simple subst., it<br>\
may be rendered Work, labour, or service: and<br>\
a deed, or an action:] or it has a more particular<br>\
meaning than فِعْلٌ; for it is a فِعْل [or deed] with<br>\
a sort of difficulty; and therefore it is not attributed to God: or, accord. to Er-Rághib, it is<br>\
any فِعْل [i. e. deed or action] that proceeds from<br>\
an animate being by his intention; and thus it<br>\
has a more particular meaning than فِعْلٌ; for the<br>\
فعل is sometimes attributed to animate beings<br>\
from which it proceeds without intention; and<br>\
sometimes to inanimate things, to which the عَمَل<br>\
is seldom attributed; and this is not used in relation to [irrational] animals except [as implied] in<br>\
the phrases إِبِلٌ عَوَامِلُ and بَقَرٌ عَوَامِلُ: or, accord.<br>\
to MF, the عَمَل is a motion of the whole, or of a<br>\
portion, of the body; and sometimes, of the mind;<br>\
so that it is the utterance of a saying, as well as<br>\
the doing a deed with the member, or limb, with<br>\
which things are gained or earned; though most<br>\
readily understood as applied particularly to the<br>\
latter; and some apply it particularly to that<br>\
which is not a saying: it is also said that a saying<br>\
is not termed عَمَلٌ in the common conventional<br>\
language: and the truth is said to be, that it is<br>\
not included in the terms عَمَلٌ and فِعْلٌ otherwise<br>\
than tropically: (TA:) [see also عَمِلَةٌ:] the pl.<br>\
of عَمَلٌ [used as a simple subst.] is أَعْمَالٌ. (K.)<br>\
In the following saying, of a woman dandling<br>\
her child, (S,) or of Keys Ibn-Ásim, (O, TA,)<br>\
dandling his child Hakeem, (TA,)<br>\
أَشْبِهْ أَبَا أُمِّكَ أَوْ أَشْبِهْ عَمَلْ<br>\
the last word is a proper name of a man: (S, O,<br>\
TA:) or, accord. to Aboo-Zekereeyà, [the meaning is, Share thou in the qualities of the father of<br>\
thy mother, or share thou in the qualities of my<br>\
course of action; for he says that] by عَمَلْ is here<br>\
meant عَمَلِى. (TA.) اِبْنُ عَمَلِى means He who<br>\
does my work, or the like of what I do. (TA in<br>\
art. بنى.) And [hence,] فُلَانٌ ابْنُ عَمَلٍ Such a<br>\
one is strong. (TA.) And بَنُو عَمَلٍ Those who<br>\
journey on foot. (O, K, * TA.) [And عَمَلُ النَّخْلِ,<br>\
occurring in the T, voce ضَيْعَةٌ, means The culture<br>\
of palm-trees: like as عَمَلُ الأرْضِ means agriculture]. ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَمَلٌ signifies also The striving,<br>\
labouring, or toiling, in work; or the holding on,<br>\
or continuing, in work: so in the saying of El-<br>\
Kutámee<br>\
فَقَدْ يَهُونُ عَلَى المُسْتَنْجِحِ العَمَلُ<br>\
[For verily the striving, &amp;c., in work is a light<br>\
matter to him who seeks success]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Also<br>\
An office of administration; and particularly the<br>\
office of governor of a province; and the office of<br>\
collector of the poor-rates, and the like: and an<br>\
agency of any kind; the management of the<br>\
affairs and property of another; an employment.<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Also A province; or territory under a governor appointed by a sovereign. Pl. in this and<br>\
other senses as above.]<br>\
عَمِلٌ, as an epithet applied to a man, i. q. ذُو<br>\
عَمَلٍ [Having work, labour, or service]; (Sb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ عَمُولٌ: (K:) or adapted, or disposed, by nature, to work, labour, or service; (S,<br>\
O, K;) and so ↓ عَمُولٌ: (S, * O, * K:) or this<br>\
latter signifies that makes much gain. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And, applied to lightning, Continuing, or continual. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَمِلَةٌ, applied to a she-camel, Brisk, light, active, or quick; (K, TA;)<br>\
like ↓ يَعْمَلَةٌ; (TA;) and so ↓ عَمَّالَةٌ. (A, TA.)<br>\
عَمْلَةٌ Theft: or treachery, perfidy, or unfaithfulness: (O, K:) it is not used otherwise than<br>\
in relation to evil. (O.)<br>\
عُمْلَةٌ: see عُمَالَةٌ.<br>\
عِمْلَةٌ A mode, or manner, of work, labour, or<br>\
service; or of doing, or acting; or of making.<br>\
(K, TA.) One says رَجُلٌ خَبِيثُ العِمْلَةِ, meaning<br>\
A man bad, or corrupt, in respect of [the mode<br>\
of] gain. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also عَمِلَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  And see<br>\
عُمَالَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also The internal state, or condition, of<br>\
a man, in relation to evil. (K.)<br>\
عَمِلَةٌ, with kesr to the م, is syn. with عَمَلٌ [as<br>\
signifying A deed, or an action]: (O, K:) so in<br>\
the saying of a woman of the Arabs, مَا كَانَ لِى<br>\
عَمِلَةٌ إِلَّا فَسَادُكُمْ [There was no deed, or action,<br>\
for me, except the corrupting of you]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And A thing that is done, or performed; or that<br>\
is made; (مَا عُمِلَ;) as also ↓ عِمْلةٌ. (K.)<br>\
عِمْلَى: see عُمَالَةٌ.<br>\
[<br>\

the ل musheddedeh, (K, TA, but in the CK<br>\
العِمِلَّيْنِ,) or العِمْلِينَ, or العُمَلِينَ, (K, TA,) or,<br>\
accord. to ISd as on the authority of Th,<br>\
العِمَلين and العِمْلين, [app. العِمَلِينَ and<br>\
العِمْلِينَ,] (TA,) or العِملَيْنِ, [thus written without any vowel-sign to the م, and in the dual<br>\
form,] (O as on the authority of Aboo-Zeyd,)<br>\
and IAar adds العِمْلَيْنِ, with the م quiescent,<br>\
(O,) [compare البُلَغِينَ and البُِرَحِينْ, which suggest that the correct forms may be العُمَلِينَ and<br>\
العِمَلِينَ,] He exceeded the ordinary bounds, (K,)<br>\
or went to the utmost point, (O, K,) in annoying him, (K,) or in reviling him and annoying<br>\
him. (O.)<br>\
عَمُولٌ: see عَمِلٌ, in two places.<br>\
