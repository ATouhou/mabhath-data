عَشِقَ, aor.<br>\
عَشَقَ, (S, O, Msb, K, [accord. to the<br>\
TA, said in the Msb to be like ضَرَبَ, but in my<br>\
copy of the Msb it is correctly said to be of the<br>\
class of تَعِبَ,]) inf. n. عِشْقٌ and عَشَقٌ, (S, O, K,)<br>\
the latter mentioned by Fr, and said by Ibn-EsSarráj to be thus by poetic license, and with two<br>\
fet-hahs because two kesrehs are rare in nouns,<br>\
(S, O,) or the former is a simple subst., and the<br>\
latter is the inf. n., (Msb,) [and app. مَعْشَقٌ also,]<br>\
He loved (another, S, O, K) excessively; (IF, S,<br>\
O, Msb, K;) [or passionately; or with amorous<br>\
desire; or, agreeably with explanations of عِشْقٌ<br>\
below, admiringly; or with blindness to defects in<br>\
the object of his love; or with a disease of the<br>\
nature of melancholia;] and ↓ تعشّق as trans. is<br>\
syn. with عَشِقَ as such. (TA.) [See also عَاشِقٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And عَشِقَتْ said of a she-camel, She was, or<br>\
became, vehemently desirous of the stallion. (AA,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَشِقَ بِهِ He, or it, stuck to him, or<br>\
it; (O, K;) as also عَسِقَ به. (O.)<br>\
2<br>\
عشّقهُ is used in the present day as meaning<br>\
He made him to be affected with عِشْق; but is<br>\
probably post-classical.]<br>\
5<br>\
تعشّق He affected عِشْق: (S, O, K: * [in the<br>\
K, تعشّقهُ, in which the pronoun app. refers to<br>\
العِشْق, is erroneously put for تعشّق:]) or he<br>\
showed, or exhibited, عِشْق. (KL.) And He was,<br>\
or became, عَاشِق. (KL.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1.<br>\
عِشْقٌ (IF, S, O, Msb, K) [generally held to be<br>\
an inf. n.] and ↓ مَعْشَقٌ [likewise app. an inf. n.]<br>\
(O, K) Excessive love; (IF, S, O, Msb, K;) [or<br>\
passionate love; or amorous desire:] or attackment to women: (IF, Msb:) or the lover&#39;s<br>\
admiration (عَجَب [for عُجْبُ in the CK is a<br>\
mistranscription for عَجَبُ]) of the beloved; and<br>\
it may be in chasteness and in immorality; (K;)<br>\
or عِشْقٌ may be in chasteness and حُبٌّ may be in<br>\
immorality: (TA:) or blindness of the sense to the<br>\
faults, or defects, of the beloved: or a disease of<br>\
the nature of melancholia (مَرَضٌ وَسْوَاسِىٌّ), which<br>\
one procures to himself by making his thought to<br>\
exercise absolute power over the approval of certain forms: (K:) Th, being asked respecting<br>\
الحُبّ and العِشْق, which of them is the more<br>\
commendable, said, الحُبّ, because in العِشْق is<br>\
excess: (TA:) [see also حُبٌّ:] Ibn-Seenà, [whom<br>\
we commonly call Avicenna,] in a treatise on<br>\
العِشْق, [regarding it as meaning natural propension,] says that it is not peculiar to the human<br>\
species, but pervades all existing things of the<br>\
celestial and the elemental and the vegetable and<br>\
the mineral and the animal, and that its meaning<br>\
is not perceived nor known, and is rendered more<br>\
obscure by explanation thereof: (MF, TA:) it is<br>\
said in the A that العِشْق is derived from العَشَقَةُ,<br>\
which means the [plant commonly called] لَبْلَاب,<br>\
because it twines upon trees, and cleaves to them.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عَشَقٌ The لَبْلَاب [a species of dolichos, the dolichos lablab of Linn.]; one of which is called عَشَقَةٌ:<br>\
IDrd says, the [common] people assert that the<br>\
عَشَقَة is the لَبْلَابَة: (O:) accord. to Zj, (TA,)<br>\
عَشَقَةٌ signifies a certain tree [or plant] that becomes green, and then becomes slender and yellow:<br>\
(K, TA:) and عَشَقٌ is its pl. [or rather the coll.<br>\
gen. n.]: (K:) and Kr says that with the postclassical authors it is the لَبْلَات. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
The [tree called] أَرَاك. (TA.)<br>\
عُشُقٌ, with two dammehs, A camel that keeps<br>\
to the female which he covers and which desires<br>\
none but him. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And Men who<br>\
trim, or dress, or put into a good or right state,<br>\
the sets [so I render غُرُوس, as pl. accord. to general analogy of غَرْسٌ,] of sweet-smelling plants.<br>\
(IAar, O, K.)<br>\
عَشِيقٌ i. q. عَاشِقٌ, q. v. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَشِيقُ العُلَى<br>\
is a metaphorical expression like خَدِينُ العُلَى<br>\
[meaning Excessive lover of eminence]. (TA in<br>\
art. خدن.)<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. ↓ مَعْشُوقٌ [Loved excessively, &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
عِشِّيقٌ Affected with much عِشْق; (ISk, S, O, K;)<br>\
applied to a man. (ISk, S, O.)<br>\
عَشِيقٌ Loving excessively; [or passionately;] &amp;c.;<br>\
(Msb, K;) [or an excessive, or a passionate, lover;]<br>\
as also ↓ عَاشِقَةٌ: (TA:) the former applied to a<br>\
man and to a woman, (Msb, K,) and عَاشِقَةٌ also<br>\
is applied to a woman, (K:) they said اِمْرَأَةٌ عَاشِقٌ<br>\
لِزَوْجِهَا [A woman excessively, or passionately,<br>\
loving to her husband]; (Fr, S, O;) and sometimes they said عَاشِقَةٌ: (O:) pl. عُشَّاقٌ (TA)<br>\
[and عُشَّقٌ, mentioned in the O as an epithet<br>\
applied to eyes (عُيُون), by Ru-beh]: it is asserted<br>\
that the عَاشِق is thus called from العَشَقَةُ meaning<br>\
the لَبْلَابَة, because of his becoming dried up: (O,<br>\
TA:) or from عَشِقَ بِهِ, because of his cleaving to<br>\
the object of his love. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] عَاشِقُ<br>\
الأَبْكَارِ an appellation of The insect called حُرْقُوص<br>\
[q. v.]; because of its entering into the فَرْج of the<br>\
virgin girl. (IB, TA voce حرقوص.)<br>\
