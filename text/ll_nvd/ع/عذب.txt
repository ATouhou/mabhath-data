عَذُبَ, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) aor.<br>\
عَذُبَ, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. عُذُوبَةٌ, said of water, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
[and app. of wine or other beverage, and of food,<br>\
(see عَذْبٌ,)] It was, or became, sweet: (S, O, *<br>\
TA:) or it was, or became, easy and agreeable to<br>\
be drunk or swallowed. (Msb.) [See also 12. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Freytag has also assigned to it a meaning belonging to أَعْذَبَ, q. v.]<br>\
-A2-  عَذَبَ: see 4, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
-A3-  And see also 2, last sentence.<br>\
-A4-<br>\
[عَذِبَ, inf. n. عَذَبٌ, is mentioned by Golius as<br>\
signifying “ Quisquiliis aut lente palustri obducta<br>\
fuit,” and in a similar manner by Freytag; by<br>\
both as said of water, and as on the authority of<br>\
the K: but I find, in the K, no ground for this,<br>\
except an explanation of عَذِبٌ, q.v., of which<br>\
ISd knew not a verb.]<br>\
2<br>\
عذّبهُ, inf. n. تَعْذِيبٌ, He punished, castigated, or chastised, him: (S, O, Msb, K:) [and<br>\
he, or it, tormented, or tortured, him:] originally,<br>\
he beat him: then, he punished him in any painful manner. (Msb.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّ<br>\
المَيِّتَ يُعَذَّبُ بِبُكَآءِ أَهْلِهِ عَلَيْهِ [Verily the dead will<br>\
be punished for his family&#39;s weeping for him]:<br>\
the reason of which is probably this; that the<br>\
Arabs used to charge their families to weep and<br>\
wail for them; therefore the dead is obnoxious to<br>\
punishment for his having done this. (IAth,<br>\
TA.) And the verb is used metaphorically in<br>\
relation to that which has not sensation: a poet<br>\
says,<br>\
لَيْسَتْ بِسَوْدَآءَ مِنْ مَيْثَآءَ مُظْلِمَةٍ<br>\
وَلَمْ تُعَذَّبْ بِإِدْنَآءٍ مِنَ النَّارِ<br>\
[It (app. wine) is not black, from Meytha, darkcoloured; nor has it been mulled (such seems to<br>\
be here the meaning of the verb) by being put<br>\
near to fire, or by being boiled]. (L, TA. [See<br>\
also مُعَذَّبَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 4, in two places.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
عذّب سَوْطَهُ, and هدّبهُ, [perhaps a mistranscription for ↓ عَذَبَهُ, for accord. to Golius, this last<br>\
and the first here mentioned are expl. by Z in the<br>\
sense here following,] He put an عِلَاقَة [i. e. an<br>\
عَذَبَة] to his whip: so in the A. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اعذب القَوْمُ The people, or party, became in<br>\
the condition of having sweet water. (K, TA.<br>\
[Freytag has erroneously assigned this meaning to<br>\
عَذُبَ.])<br>\
-A2-  And اعذب, (O, TA,) inf.n. إِعْذَابٌ,<br>\
(K, TA,) He abstained, or desisted, (O, K, * TA,)<br>\
عَنْ شَىْءٍ from a thing; (TA;) and, (K, TA,) in<br>\
like manner followed by عَنْ, (TA,) he left,<br>\
quitted, or relinquished, (K, TA,) a thing: (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ استعذب, (K, TA,) likewise followed by<br>\
عَنْ, (TA,) signifies the same: (K, TA:) and<br>\
عَذْبٌ, (K, TA,) as inf. n. of ↓ عَذَبَ, (MF, TA,)<br>\
signifies the abstaining, &amp;c., (K, MF, TA,) from<br>\
a thing: and [particularly] the abstaining (of a<br>\
man, and of an ass, and of a horse, TA) from<br>\
eating, by reason of intense thirst; (K, TA;)<br>\
being neither fasting nor breaking fast; (TA;)<br>\
and so عُذُوبٌ as inf. n. of the same verb. (MF,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And اعذبهُ, (S, O,) inf. n. إِعْذَابٌ;<br>\
(K;) and ↓ عذّبهُ, (O,) inf. n. تَعْذِيبٌ; (K;)<br>\
and ↓ عَذَبَهُ, (O,) inf. n. عَذْبٌ; (K;) He prevented, hindered, withheld, restrained, or forbade,<br>\
him, (S, O, K, *) عَنِ الأَمْرِ from [doing] the thing,<br>\
or affair. (S, O.) One says, أَعْذِبْ نَفْسَكَ عَنْ<br>\
كَذَا Withhold, or restrain, thyself from such a<br>\
thing. (S, O.)<br>\
-A4-  اعذبهُ [He deprived it of its<br>\
عَذَب; i. e.] he removed from it, (S, O, K,)<br>\
namely, water, (K,) or a watering-trough, or<br>\
tank, (S, O,) the floating particles that were upon<br>\
it, (S, O,) or its [green substance termed] طُحْلُب,<br>\
(K,) or both of these: (TA:) and ↓ تَعْذِيبٌ [in<br>\
like manner] signifies the removing of what is<br>\
termed عَذَب. (Bd in ii. 6.)<br>\
8<br>\
اعتذب He made [the] two ends (عَذَبَتَيْنِ) of<br>\
his turban to hang down behind. (O, K, TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استعذب المَآءَ He reckoned, or esteemed,<br>\
the water sweet. (O, Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He<br>\
sought sweet water: you say, استعذب لِأَهْلِهِ he<br>\
sought sweet water for his family. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And He drank the water sweet. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
He drew sweet water. (S, O, K. *) One says,<br>\
يُسْتَعْذَبُ لِفُلَانٍ مِنْ بِئْرِ كَذَا i. e. [Sweet water] is<br>\
drawn for such a one from such a well. (S, O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And استعذب لَهُ المَآءَ He brought to him sweet<br>\
water. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 4.<br>\
12<br>\
اعذوذب, like اِحْلَولَى, said of water, It<br>\
was, or became, sweet, [like عَذُبَ,] or very sweet.<br>\
(Lb, TA.)<br>\
عَذْبٌ Sweet water: (S, O:) or water, (Msb,)<br>\
or wine, or beverage, and food, (K,) that is easy<br>\
and agreeable to be drunk or swallowed: (Msb,<br>\
K:) pl. عِذَابٌ (O, Msb, TA) and عُذُوبٌ. (TA.)<br>\
You say رَكِيَّةٌ عَذْبَةٌ [A well of sweet water] : and<br>\
مَآءٌ عَذْبٌ [sweet water]: and also مَآءَةٌ عَذْبَةٌ [a<br>\
sweet water]: and مَآءٌ عِذَابٌ [sweet water or<br>\
waters], using a pl. epithet in this last case because مَآءٌ is a coll. gen. n., of which مَآءَةٌ is the<br>\
n. un. (TA.) And Aboo-Heiyeh En-Nemeree<br>\
says, describing water,<br>\
لَهُ غَلَلٌ بَيْنَ الإِجَامِ عُذُوبُ<br>\
[Having sweet water permeating amid the reedbeds, or the thickets]: he uses غَلَلٌ as a coll.<br>\
gen. n., and therefore pluralizes the epithet. (L,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also نِساءٌ عِذَابُ الثَّنَايَا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Women sweet in respect of the front teeth].<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And إِنَّهُ لَعَذْبُ اللِّسَانِ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily he is sweet<br>\
in respect of the tongue]; likening his tongue to<br>\
the water that is termed عَذْب. (Lh, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also A sort of trees; (K, TA;) the same that is<br>\
called عَذَبٌ [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
عَذَبٌ, (S, O, K,) [a coll. gen. n.] of which, in<br>\
all its senses, the n. un. is darr; عَذَبَةٌ, (K, TA,)<br>\
Motes, or particles of rubbish or the like, (S, O,<br>\
K, TA,) floating upon water. (TA.) [In this<br>\
sense, it is said in the S and O that عَذَبَةٌ is its<br>\
sing. or n. un.] One says مَآءٌ ذُو عَذَبٍ Water<br>\
abounding with such motes or particles. (S, O.<br>\
See also عَذِبٌ.) And ↓ عَذِبَةٌ has the same meaning as the n. un. of عَذَبٌ in this sense: (K:)<br>\
and signifies likewise, as also ↓ عَذَبَةٌ and ↓ عَذْبَةٌ,<br>\
(L, K,) this last mentioned by IAar, (L,) [the<br>\
green substance called] طُحْلُب (L, K, TA) and<br>\
عَرْمَض and the like, (L, TA,) or طُحْلُب and<br>\
dung (دِمْن), floating upon water. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And What comes forth next after the fœtus from<br>\
the womb. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A sort of trees,<br>\
(AHn, O, K,) of the shrub-kind: (AHn, O:)<br>\
the same that is called عَذْبٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And<br>\
The pieces of rag that women hold when wailing<br>\
for the dead; as also مَعَاذِبُ, (O, K,) pl. of<br>\
↓ مَعْذَبَةٌ [or probably مِعْذَبَةٌ, like its syn. مِئْلَاةٌ,<br>\
originally مِئْلَوَةٌ], or , accord. to AA, an anomalous<br>\
pl. of [the n. un. of عَذَبٌ, i. e.] عَذَبَةٌ: (O:) one<br>\
of such pieces of rag is also called مِعْوَزٌ, as well<br>\
as عَذَبَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Straps, or thongs: (S,<br>\
O:) or the extremities thereof; as also ↓ عَذَبَاتٌ.<br>\
(TA.) So in the saying of Dhu-r-Rummeh, (S,<br>\
O, TA,) describing dogs of the chase, (O,)<br>\
غُضْفٌ مُهَرَّتَةُ الأَشْدَاقِ ضَارِيَةٌ<br>\
مِثْلُ السَّرَاحِينِ فِى أَعْنَاقِهَا العَذَبُ<br>\
[Having pendulous ears, wide in the sides of the<br>\
mouth, habituated to the chase, resembling wolves,<br>\
with straps, or thongs, or the extremities thereof,<br>\
upon their necks]. (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, (K,) or<br>\
↓ عَذَبَةٌ, in this and other senses following, (S, O,<br>\
Msb, &amp;c.,) [the former evidently wrong, the<br>\
latter (as is said in the K) being its n. un. in all<br>\
its senses,] The string with which a balance,<br>\
or pair of scales, is raised. (S, O, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And The end, or extremity, of a whip; (Mgh in<br>\
art. ثمر, and Msb;) its tail; also called its ثَمَرَة:<br>\
(Mgh ubi suprà:) or its عِلَاقَة, (TA in the present<br>\
art.,) which means the [suspensory] thong in the<br>\
handle thereof: (TA in art. علق:) or [it may<br>\
have both of these significations, for it is said<br>\
that it is] one of the عَذَبَتَانِ of a whip. (S, O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  The end, or extremity of anything. (A, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  The extremity of the tongue; (S, O, Msb;)<br>\
its [tip or] narrow extremity: (TA:) pl. ↓ عَذَبَاتٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) One says, أَلْسِنَتِهِمْ ↓ الحَقُّ عَلَى عَذَبَاتِ<br>\
[Truth is on the tips of their tongues]. (A, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  The extremity of the penis of a camel: (ISd,<br>\
K, TA:) or the extremity of a camel&#39;s penis thin<br>\
in the fore part. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  The part that hangs<br>\
down of the [thong called] شِرَاك [q. v.] of a<br>\
sandal. (O, TA. [See also ذُؤَابَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b9-  A piece<br>\
of skin which is hung behind the hinder part<br>\
(مُؤْخِرَة, O, K, or مُؤَخَّرَة, CK) of the [camel&#39;s<br>\
saddle called] رَحْل, (O, K,) from its upper portion; (O;) also termed ذُؤَابَةٌ. (TA in art. ذأب.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b10-  And عَذَبٌ [accord. to the TA, but correctly<br>\
↓ عَذَبَةٌ, (see 8,)] The portion [i. e. end] of a<br>\
turban, that is made to hang down between the<br>\
shoulders. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  And the same, [correctly<br>\
↓ عَذَبَةٌ, as is shown by what follows,] A piece<br>\
of rag [or strip of linen or the like, called in<br>\
French cravate,] that is bound upon the head of<br>\
a spear. (TA.) One says, خَفَقَتْ عَلَى رَأْسِهِ<br>\
العَذَبُ (A, TA) i. e. خِرَقُ الأَلْوِيَةِ [The cravates<br>\
fluttered over his head]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b12-  And ↓ عَذَبَةٌ<br>\
signifies also A branch of a tree; (S, O, Msb;)<br>\
and so ↓ عَذِبَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
عَذِبٌ (K, TA) and ↓ ذُو عَذَبٍ (TA) Water<br>\
overspread by [the green substance termed] طُحْلُب:<br>\
(K, TA:) or abounding therewith, and with motes,<br>\
or particles of rubbish or the like: (TA:) [or the<br>\
latter signifies as expl. before: see عَذَبٌ, third<br>\
sentence:] عَذِبٌ is thought by ISd to be a possessive epithet, [meaning ذُو عَذَبٍ,] because he<br>\
found no verb belonging to it. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَذِبٌ<br>\
is also syn. with عَظِبٌ meaning A man alighting,<br>\
or abiding, in places of dried-up herbage, and in<br>\
a waterless desert. (TA in art. عظب.)<br>\
عَذْبَةٌ: see عَذَبٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain tree, that<br>\
kills camels, (O, K, TA,) if they eat thereof.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A well-known medicine. (K, TA.<br>\
[In some copies of the K, دَآءٌ, or “ disease,” is<br>\
put for دَوَآءٌ, accord. to the TK, as observed by<br>\
Freytag.])<br>\
عَذَبَةٌ, and its pl. عَذَبَاتٌ: see عَذَبٌ, in nine<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  The pl. above mentioned signifies also<br>\
The legs of a she-camel. (TA.)<br>\
عَذِبَةٌ: see عَذَبٌ, fourth and last sentences.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also What is taken forth from طَعَام [i. e. wheat,<br>\
or corn in general,] and thrown away; (Lh, K,<br>\
TA;) being the worst thereof; also termed عَذِرَةٌ.<br>\
(Lh, TA in art. عذر.)<br>\
-A3-  And Pasturage, or<br>\
herbage: so in the phrase مَآءٌ مَا بِهِ عَذِبَةٌ, (O,)<br>\
or مَآء لَا عَذِبَةَ فِيهِ [Water where is no pasturage,<br>\
or herbage]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also expl. in copies<br>\
of the K as signifying, with the article, مَا أَحَاطَ<br>\
مِنَ الدِّرَّةِ: but the right explanation is مَا أَحَاطَ<br>\
بِالدَّبْرَةِ [app. meaning The ridge of earth that surrounds a sown piece of ground to retain the water<br>\
for irrigation (see دَبْرٌ)], as in the M and L &amp;c.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
عَذَبِىٌّ, (thus in my copies of the S,) or عُذَبِىٌّ,<br>\
(O, K, TA,) with the pointed ذ, accord. to AA,<br>\
mentioned in the T in art. عدب, as written<br>\
with the unpointed د, and here said in the K to<br>\
be syn. with عُدَبِىٌّ, (TA,) Generous in natural<br>\
dispositions. (AA, S, O, TA.)<br>\
أَصَابَهُ عَذَابُ عِذَبِينَ, (O, K, TA,) with kesr to<br>\
the ع and fet-h to the ذ, (O, TA,) like بِلَغِينَ,<br>\
(K, TA, in the CK عُذَبِينَ like بُلَغِينَ,) and<br>\
أَصَابَهُ العِذَبُونَ, (O, TA,) [May the punishment<br>\
that will not be remitted befall him, or] may his<br>\
punishment not be remitted: (O, K, TA:) so says<br>\
Ibn-Buzurj. (O, TA.)<br>\
عَذَابٌ Punishment, castigation, or chastisement,<br>\
[or] such as serves to give warning to others than<br>\
the sufferer, or to restrain the offender from repeating the offence; syn. عُقُوبَةٌ, (S, O,) or نَكَالٌ:<br>\
(K, and Ksh and Bd in ii. 6:) so termed from<br>\
عَذَبَ “ he prevented ” &amp;c.; because it prevents<br>\
the person punished from returning to the like of<br>\
his offence, and prevents others from doing the<br>\
like of that which he has done: (MF, TA:) [it<br>\
generally signifies any corporal punishment:]<br>\
and, by an extension of the original signification,<br>\
any [infliction of] pain that disgraces, or puts to<br>\
shame: (Ksh and Bd ubi suprà:) originally,<br>\
beating: afterwards used to signify any painful<br>\
punishment: [torture; or torment:] and metaphorically applied to (tropical:)  an affair, or event, that<br>\
is difficult, distressing, afflicting, or troublesome;<br>\
whence the saying, السَّفَرُ قِطْعَةٌ مِنَ العَذَابِ [Travel<br>\
is a portion of that which is difficult, &amp;c.; or of<br>\
torment]: (Msb:) in the Kur xxiii. 78, it means<br>\
hunger, or famine: (Zj, O, TA:) the pl. is أَعْذِبَةٌ:<br>\
(Zj, K, TA:) the author of the K says in art.<br>\
نهر [voce نَهَارٌ] that it has no pl.: [and it seems<br>\
to be doubted whether it have a pl. because it is<br>\
properly an inf. n. though its verb in the unaugmented form is not used:] but MF observes<br>\
that if it be a name for that whereby one is prevented [from repeating an offence], as hunger, or<br>\
famine, agreeably with what Zj says, there is no<br>\
reason why it should not have this pl. (TA.)<br>\
عَذُوبٌ: see عَاذِبٌ, in seven places.<br>\
عَذَابَةٌ The womb; thus mentioned by Az, on<br>\
the authority of El-Mundhiree and AHeyth,<br>\
with the pointed ذ; (O, TA;) i. q. عَدَابَةٌ.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
عَاذِبٌ and ↓ عَذُوبٌ, applied to a horse or the<br>\
like, &amp;c., (S, O,) Such as is standing still, or<br>\
stopping from fatigue, (قَائِمٌ, S,) that will not<br>\
eat nor drink: (S, O:) or abstaining, or that<br>\
abstains, from eating, by reason of intense thirst;<br>\
(K, TA;) applied to a man, and an ass, and a<br>\
horse: but Az says that the assertion respecting<br>\
these two epithets that they signify [a horse, &amp;c.]<br>\
that neither eats nor drinks is more correct than<br>\
the assertion respecting ↓ عَذُوبٌ that it signifies<br>\
[one] that abstains from eating by reason of his<br>\
thirst: also, that عَاذِبٌ signifies any animal, but<br>\
generally a horse and a camel, that will not eat<br>\
anything: accord. to Th, this and ↓ عَذُوبٌ signify<br>\
a horse or the like standing still, or stopping from<br>\
fatigue, (قَائِمٌ,) that raises his head, and will not<br>\
eat nor drink; and the former, that passes a<br>\
night without eating anything: (TA:) the pl. of<br>\
عَاذِبٌ is عُذُوبٌ, like as سُجُودٌ is a pl. of سَاجِدٌ:<br>\
and the pl. of ↓ عَذُوبٌ is عُذُبٌ, and, accord. to<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd, عُذُوبٌ [like as هُجُودٌ is pl. of هَجُودٌ]:<br>\
Az says that this is a mistake, for a word of the<br>\
measure فَعُولٌ does not form a pl. of the measure<br>\
فُعُولٌ; but [SM says] this is an extr. instance;<br>\
and he who preserves an authority in his mind<br>\
is an evidence against him who does not. (TA.)<br>\
One says, ↓ بَاتَ عَذُوبًا, meaning He passed the<br>\
night without eating or drinking anything; because abstaining therefrom. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَاذِبٌ signifies also [Unsheltered;] having no covering<br>\
between him and the sky; (O, K;) and so<br>\
↓ عَذُوبٌ. (K, TA.) El-Jaadee says, describing<br>\
a wild bull (ثَوْر وَحْشِىّ [a species of bovine antelope]) that had passed the night alone, tasting<br>\
nothing,<br>\
لِلسَّمَآءِ كَأَنَّهُ ↓ فَبَاتَ عَذُوبًا<br>\
سُهَيْلٌ إِذَا مَا أَفْرَدَتْهُ الكَوَاكِبُ<br>\
[And he passed the night exposed without shelter<br>\
to the sky, as though he were Canopus when the<br>\
other stars have left him solitary]. (TA.)<br>\
الأَعْذَبَانِ [The two most sweet things;] saliva<br>\
(الرِّيق, S, O, K, or الرُّضَاب, A) and wine: (S,<br>\
A, O, K: [for, in the amorous language of the<br>\
Arab, the sweetness of the saliva of his beloved<br>\
is often praised:]) or food and coïtus. (K.)<br>\
لِجَامٌ مُعْذِبٌ A bridle that withholds from going<br>\
away in a headlong manner. (O.)<br>\
مَعْذَبَةٌ [or مِعْذَبَةٌ?]: see عَذَبٌ.<br>\
مُعَذَّبَةٌ [for خَمْرٌ مُعَذَّبَةٌ] Wine mixed [with<br>\
water, or with some other thing or things]. (A,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And معذب [app. مُعَذَّب] is applied by<br>\
the vulgar to Fresh ripe dates soaked with water.<br>\
(TA voce مَنْقُوشٌ.)<br>\
-A2-  سَوْطٌ مُعَذَّبٌ A whip having<br>\
an عِلَاقَة [or عَذَبَة] attached to it. (TA.)<br>\
اِمْرَأَةٌ مَعْذَابُ الرِّيقِ A woman whose saliva is<br>\
pleasant to be swallowed, and sweet. (TA.)<br>\
