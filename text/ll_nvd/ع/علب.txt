place where the سِدْر [rhamnus nabeca, or rhamnus<br>\
spina Christi, a species of lote-tree,] grows: pl.<br>\

Aegypt. Arab., p. cvi.,) علب (thus written by<br>\

to a he-goat, and to a [lizard of the species-called]<br>\
ضَبّ, Advanced in age, and hard, tough, or<br>\
coarse: (S, O:) and applied to a mountain-goat,<br>\
(O, K, TA,) in this sense; (TA;) or as meaning<br>\
advanced in age; (O;) or large, or bulky, (K, TA,)<br>\
advanced in age; because of his strength; (TA;)<br>\
and [in the same sense applied to] a ضَبّ, as also<br>\
↓ عُلْبٌ: (K:) and applied to a man, as meaning<br>\
thick, coarse, rough, or rude. (TA.) And A<br>\
hard, tough, or coarse, plant. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And A<br>\
camel having the disease termed عَلَبٌ [q. v.]; as<br>\
also ↓ أَعْلَبُ. (TA.)<br>\
عُلْبَةٌ A milking-vessel of skin, (S, O, TA,) or of<br>\
wood, like a large قَدَح [or bowl]: (TA:) or a<br>\
large قَدَح of camel&#39;s skin, or of wood, into which<br>\
one milks: (K:) or a bowl into which the she-camel is milked: or a قَدَح of wood, or of skin<br>\
and wood: or a vessel of skin, in the form of a<br>\
bowl, with a wooden hoop: Az says, it is a piece<br>\
of skin taken from the side of a camel&#39;s hide while<br>\
it is fresh; it is made round, and filled with soft<br>\
sand; then its edges are drawn together, and perforated with a wooden skewer, and it is bound so<br>\
as to be closed, [thus] contracted, by a cord [passed<br>\
through the holes made with the skewer], and left<br>\
until it becomes dry and tough; then its upper<br>\
part is cut off, and it stands by reason of its dryness, resembling a round bowl, as though it were<br>\
carved out, or fashioned by the turner; the pastor<br>\
and the rider suspend it, and milk into it, and<br>\
drink out of it; and it is convenient to the man of<br>\
the desert by its lightness, and its not breaking<br>\
when the camel shakes it about or when it falls to<br>\
the ground: (TA:) IAar says that this word and<br>\
جَنْبَةٌ and دَسْمَآءُ and سَمْرَآءُ all signify the same:<br>\
(O:) the pl. is عُلَبٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and عِلَابٌ.<br>\
(S, Msb, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A tall palm-tree: (O, K:)<br>\
[see ↓ عُلْبٌ (voce سَاجِدٌ), a coll. gen. n. used as a<br>\
pl.; or a pl., and, if so, app. a contraction of<br>\
عُلَبٌ, by poetic license: Sgh, however, adds,]<br>\
but some say that it is ↓ عَلَبَةٌ [i. e.] بِالتَّحْرِيك. (O.)<br>\
عِلْبَةٌ A thick knot of wood, (IAar, O, K, TA,)<br>\
otherwise expl. as a great branch of a tree, (TA,)<br>\
whereof is made the مِقْطَرَة, (IAar, O, K, TA,)<br>\
which is a wooden thing having in it holes adapted<br>\
to the size of the legs of the persons confined [by<br>\
it, i. e. a kind of stocks]: (TA:) pl. عِلَبٌ. (IAar,<br>\
O, TA.) A poet says,<br>\
فِى رِجْلِهِ عِلْبَةٌ خَشْنَآءُ مِنْ قَرَظٍ<br>\
[Upon his leg was a rough kind of stocks of the<br>\
wood of the tree called karadh]. (O, TA.)<br>\
عَلَبَةٌ: see عُلْبَةٌ, last sentence.<br>\
عِلْبَآءٌ [perfectly decl., because the ء is a letter<br>\
of quasi-coordination, i. e., added to render the<br>\
word quasi-coordinate to the class of قِرْطَاسٌ and<br>\
the like,] The عَصَب of the neck; [app. meaning<br>\
the upper, cervical, tendinous portion of the trapezius muscle;] (S, O, K; [in all of which, mention is made of the علبآء of the camel, to which<br>\
it seems to be most commonly applied, and also<br>\
to that of a man;]) it is one of a pair, and between one علبآء and the other is the place of growth<br>\
of the mane; (S, O;) Az explains it as specially<br>\
applied to the thick عَصَب; and IAth, as the<br>\
عَصَب in the neck, extending to the كَاهِل [or part<br>\
between the two shoulder-blades]: ISd says that it<br>\
is syn. with عَقَبٌ [q. v.]: (TA:) [it is also said<br>\
that] it signifies the عَصَبَة [i. e. tendon, or sinew,]<br>\
that extends in the neck: (Msb:) or the yellow<br>\
عَصَبَة in the side (صَفْحَة) of the neck; one of a<br>\
pair: (A:) and the عِلْبَاوَانِ in a man are [said<br>\
to be] the two yellow tendons or sinews (العَصَبَتَانِ<br>\
الصَّفْرَاوَانِ) in the مَتْن [or part next the spine, on<br>\
either side,] of the neck: (Zj in his “ Khalk el-Insán: ”) [but of all the meanings thus assigned to<br>\
it, the first seems to be the most proper, or at<br>\
least the most usual: see Q. Q. 1:] the Arabs<br>\
used to bind therewith, in the fresh, or moist,<br>\
state, the أَجْفَان [or sheaths] of their swords, and<br>\
also their spears when cracked, and it dried upon<br>\
them, and became strong: (IAth, TA:) the<br>\
word is masc., (Lh, TA,) or [it is masc. and fem.,<br>\
but] the making it fem. is preferred [though this<br>\
is contr. to analogy]: (Msb:) the dual is عِلْبَاوَانِ<br>\
(S, A, O, Msb) and عِلْبَا آنِ; (S, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
[the former app. the more common, but the latter<br>\
the more proper;] for the ء [in the sing.] is a letter<br>\
of quasi-coordination [and therefore properly with<br>\
tenween]; but if you will, you may liken it to<br>\
the fem. ء that is in حَمْرَآءُ [of which the dual is<br>\
more properly حَمْرَاوَانِ], or to the radical ء [or<br>\
rather the ء that is substituted for the last radical<br>\
letter] in كِسَآءٌ [of which the dual is more pro-<br>\
perly كِسَا آنِ]: (S, O:) and the pl. is عَلَابِىُّ.<br>\
(S, O, K.) You say of a man when he has<br>\
become advanced in age, تَشَنَّجَ عِلْبَآءُ الرَّجُلِ [The<br>\
علبآء of the man has become contracted]. (S, O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  The pl. عَلَابِىُّ is expl. in the K as signifying<br>\
also Lead: and in the S as signifying lead, or a<br>\
kind thereof: (TA:) El-Kutabee says, “I have<br>\
been told that العَلَابِىُّ signifies lead; but I am<br>\
not sure of it: ” and Az says, “I know not any<br>\
one who has said it, and it is not true; ” (O, TA;)<br>\
and this is the case: (O:) MF observes that its<br>\
explanation as signifying lead requires it to be a<br>\
sing. of a pl. form, or a pl. that has no sing., like<br>\
أَبَابِيلُ and عَبَادِيدُ: (TA:) in a trad., mention is<br>\
made of swords of which the ornaments were<br>\
العلابىّ and الآنُك; (O, TA;) and the coupling<br>\
of these two words together has led to the supposition that the former means lead; but there is<br>\
no evading the fact that it is the pl. of علبَآء meaning the عَصَب of the camel. (TA.)<br>\
عُلْبُوبَةُ القَوْمِ The best persons of the people, or<br>\
party. (Sh, O, K.)<br>\
عِلَابٌ A mark made with a hot iron along the<br>\
length of the neck [of a camel], (S, O, K,) upon,<br>\
or over, the عِلْبَآء. (TA.)<br>\
عَلَابِىُّ pl. of عِلْبَآءٌ [q. v.].<br>\
أَعْلَبُ: see عَلِبٌ, last sentence.<br>\
مُعْلِبَةٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
مُعَلَّبٌ A sword having its hilt bound (A, O)<br>\
with the عِلْبَآء of a camel; (O;) as also ↓ مَعْلُوبٌ.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And مُعَلَّبَةٌ A she-camel (S, K) marked<br>\
with the mark called عِلَاب; (S, O, K;) as also<br>\
↓ مُعْلِبَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
مُعَلِّبٌ One who makes the kind of vessel called<br>\
عُلْبَةٌ. (S, O.)<br>\
مُعَلْبَاةٌ One who has a perforation made in her<br>\
عِلْبَاوَانِ [dual of عِلْبَآءٌ] with the instrument called<br>\
مِدْرًى [q. v.]. (O.)<br>\
مَعْلُوبٌ A conspicuous road (S, O, K, TA) that<br>\
is marked in its two sides; or marked with the<br>\
traces of travellers. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A sword<br>\
broken in its edge. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also مُعَلَّبٌ.<br>\
