عَصًا i. q. عُودٌ [as meaning A staff, or stick, or<br>\
rod]: (K:) originally عَصَوٌ, and accordingly its<br>\
dual is as below: said to be thus called because<br>\
the fingers and hand are put together upon it [to<br>\
grasp it], from the saying عَصَوْتُ القَوْمَ “ I collected together the people, or party; ” as related<br>\
by As from some one or more of the Basrees:<br>\
(TA:) of the fem. gender: (S, Msb, K:) it is<br>\
said in a prov., ↓ العَصَا مِنَ العُصَيَّةِ [lit. The staff<br>\
is from the little staff; the dim. having the affix<br>\
ة because it is the dim. of a fem. n.]; (S;) [or]<br>\
العَصَا in this prov. is the name of a mare of<br>\
Jedheemeh [mentioned voce ضُلٌّ], and العُصَيَّة is<br>\
that of her dam; meaning that part of the thing,<br>\
or affair, is from part; (S, K, TA;) and said<br>\
when one is likened to his father; or meaning<br>\
that the big thing is in its commencement small:<br>\
(TA: [see also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 17:]) it<br>\
is not allowable to say عَصَآء; nor to affix ة: (As,<br>\
TA:) one says, هٰذِهِ عَصَاىَ أَتَوَكَّأُ عَلَيْهَا [This is<br>\
my staff; I support, or stay, myself upon it]:<br>\
Fr says that the first incorrect speech heard in<br>\
El-&#39;Irák was the saying, هٰذِهِ عَصَاتِى: (S:) the<br>\
dual is عَصَوَانِ: (S, Msb:) and the pl. [of mult.]<br>\
is عُصِىٌّ, (S, Msb, K,) [originally عُصُووٌ,] of the<br>\
measure فُعُولٌ, (S, Msb,) and عِصِىٌّ, (S, K,) in<br>\
which the ع is with kesr because of the kesrah<br>\
following it, and [of pauc.] أَعْصٍ (S, Msb, K)<br>\
and أَعْصَآءٌ, (K,) or this last is agreeable with<br>\
analogy, but has not been transmitted, (ISk,<br>\
Msb,) and is disallowed by Sb, who says that<br>\
عُصِىٌّ CCC was used in its stead. (TA.) ―<br>\
