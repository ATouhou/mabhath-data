عنّب, (O, K,) inf. n. تَعْنِيبٌ, (K,) said of a<br>\
grape-vine, [meaning It produced grapes,] (O,<br>\
K,) is from العِنَبُ. (O.)<br>\
عِنَبٌ and ↓ عِنَبَآء both signify the same, (S, O,<br>\
K,) the latter said by Kr to be the only word of<br>\
its measure except سِيَرَآء, but Kh mentions also<br>\
حِوَلَآء, and Ibn-Kuteybeh adds to these خِيَلَآء,<br>\
(TA,) [whence it seems to be, accord. to analogy,<br>\
عِنَبَآءُ, imperfectly decl., with the fem. ء, but in a<br>\
verse cited by F, and quoted in the O and TA, it is<br>\
treated as masc., and in the TA it is treated as<br>\
masc. in prose, and if so it is عِنَبَآءٌ, though it may<br>\
be thus only by poetic license, and improperly in<br>\
prose,] Grapes, the fruit of the كَرْم; (TA;) thus<br>\
called only while fresh; when dry, called زَبِيب:<br>\
(Msb:) عِنَبَةٌ signifies a single berry thereof [i. e.<br>\
a grape]; (S, O, Msb, K; *) and is of a form<br>\
generally belonging to a pl., rarely to a sing.:<br>\
(S, O:) the pl. is أَعْنَابٌ, (S, O, Msb,) used in<br>\
speaking of many; and the pl. of pauc. [i. e. pl.<br>\
of عِنَبَةٌ] is عِنَبَاتٌ. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عِنَبٌ also signifies<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The grape-vine. (MF [as from the K, in which<br>\
I do not find it: but it is used in this sense in the<br>\
Kur-án; pl. أَعْنَابٌ, expl. as meaning كُرُوم in<br>\
xviii. 31 by Bd].) ―<br>\
