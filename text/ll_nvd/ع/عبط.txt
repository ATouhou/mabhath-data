(S, O, Msb, TA,) He (a man) took a thing [app.<br>\

have been omitted in the TA by inadvertence]:<br>\
this is the primary signification. (TA: but only<br>\

from fracture, (TA,) [but see عَبِيطٌ,] and in a<br>\

signify (tropical:)  He slew a man for no crime; (O;) he<br>\
slew a man wrongfully, not in retaliation: (ElKhattábee:) and (assumed tropical:)  he wounded. (O, TA.) [Hence<br>\

rent his honour, or reputation;] he reviled him;<br>\
he detracted from his reputation, spoke against<br>\

O, * K, TA,) from الغِيبَةُ, not from الغَيْبُوبَةُ;<br>\
