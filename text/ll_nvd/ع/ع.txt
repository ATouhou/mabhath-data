ع<br>\
The eighteenth letter of the alphabet: called عَيْنٌ.<br>\
It is [one of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة, or vocal,<br>\
i. e. pronounced with the voice, not with the<br>\
breath only; and] of the letters termed حَلْقِيَّة<br>\
[or faucial]; these being ع and ح and ه and خ<br>\
and غ [and أ]; the lowest of which in its place<br>\
of utterance is ع; wherefore Kh [in the composition of his lexicon entitled “ Kitáb el-&#39;Eyn ”] and<br>\
several other lexicographers [after him] began<br>\
their books with [words having] this letter [in<br>\
their roots], giving the next place to ح, the next<br>\
to ه, the next to خ, and the next to غ. (L, TA.)<br>\
It is substituted for ء [in what is termed the عَنْعَنَة<br>\
of Temeem]; as in عَنْ for أَنْ: and for ح; as<br>\
in عَتَّى for حَتَّى, and صُبْعٌ for صُبْحٌ: and for غ;<br>\
as in عُلَامٌ for غُلَامٌ. (MF, TA.) It is never<br>\
consociated with ح in any word of which the<br>\
letters are all radicals; unless it be a word compounded of two words, as حَيْعَلَ from حَىَّ عَلَى.<br>\
(Kh, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [As a numeral, it denotes Seventy.]<br>\
