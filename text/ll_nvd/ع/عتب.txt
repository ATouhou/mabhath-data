He was incited, &amp;c., to do, or to suffer, a hardship, or difficulty. (TA.) And مَا فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ<br>\
وَلَا رَتَبٌ ↓ عَتَبٌ There is not in this thing, or<br>\
affair, or case, any hardship, or difficulty. (S,<br>\
O.) And عَتَبَاتُ المَوْتِ means The severities [or<br>\
pains or agonies] of death. (TA, from a trad.)<br>\
عُتْبَى The being well pleased, content, or satis-<br>\
fied, [with a person,] or the regarding with good<br>\
will, or favour: (M, A, K:) or good pleasure,<br>\
content, satisfaction, good will, or favour: (MA,<br>\
K, KL:) its primary signification is the returning of one whose good will, or favour, has been<br>\
solicited, or desired, to the love of his companion:<br>\
(TA:) it is the subst. from أَعْتَبَنِى as meaning<br>\
“ he returned to making me happy,” &amp;c.; (S;<br>\
see 4;) a subst. from الإِعْتَابُ; (Msb;) [i. e.] it<br>\
is put in the place of اعتاب; and [thus] it signifies<br>\
[the returning to making one happy, or doing what<br>\
is pleasing to him, from doing evil to him: or] the<br>\
returning, from doing evil, to that which makes the<br>\
person who has reproved, or blamed, or been angry,<br>\
to be well pleased, content, or satisfied: and [simply]<br>\
the returning from doing a crime, a misdeed, an<br>\
offence, or an evil action. (TA.) One says,<br>\
أَعْطَانِى العُتْبَى He granted me his good will, or<br>\
favour. (A.) And إِنَّمَا يُعَاتَبُ مَنْ تُرْجَى عِنْدَهُ<br>\
العُتْبَى Only he should be reproved in whom the<br>\
[finding a disposition to a] return from his evil<br>\
conduct may be hoped for. (TA.) And العُتْبَى<br>\
is [said to be] used when one does not mean<br>\
thereby الإِعْتَاب, (S, O, TA,) i. e. in the contr.<br>\
of its primary sense, (TA,) in the prov. لَكَ العُتْبَى<br>\
بِأَنْ لَا رَضِيتَ i. e. [بِلَا رِضَاكَ, as though meaning<br>\
Thou shalt have content, or satisfaction, without<br>\
thy being well pleased; or] I will content thee<br>\
with the contrary of what thou likest: and in<br>\
like manner the corresponding verb is [said to<br>\
be] used in the verse of Bishr Ibn-Abee-Kházim<br>\
cited above in the explanations of that verb: (S,<br>\
O, TA:) [but the prov. here mentioned may be<br>\
well rendered thou shalt return from thine evil<br>\
way against thy wish; for,] accord. to Fr, العُتْبَى<br>\
in the phrase لَكَ لعُتْبَى signifies the returning, from<br>\
what one like, to what he dislikes: (MF:) and<br>\
it signifies also [as expl. above] the returning from<br>\
doing a crime, a misdeed, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
عِتْبَانٌ and ↓ عَتْبٌ and ↓ عِتَابٌ [all mentioned<br>\
before as inf. ns.] are said to be syn. with<br>\
إِعْتَابٌ: [see 4, and عُتْبَى:] it is asserted that you<br>\
say, مَا وَجَدْتُ فِى قَوْلِهِ عِتْبَانًا [meaning I did not<br>\
find in what he said any evidence of a return to<br>\
be favourable, or to do what would be pleasing<br>\
to me], when a man has mentioned his having<br>\
granted you his good will, or favour, and you<br>\
see not any proof thereof: and some say, مَا وَجَدْتُ<br>\
↓ وَلَا عِتَابًا ↓ عِنْدَهُ عَتْبًا [in the like sense]: but Az<br>\
says, I have not heard ↓ عَتْبٌ nor عِتْبَانٌ nor<br>\
↓ عِتَابٌ in the sense of إِعْتَابٌ; but ↓ عَتْبٌ and<br>\
عِتْبَانٌ signify thy reproving a man for evil conduct,<br>\
&amp;c., as stated above; [see 1;] and ↓ عِتَابٌ and<br>\
مُعَاتَبَةٌ, mutual reproving for such conduct. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  العِتْبَانُ The male hyena: (Kr, TA:) and<br>\
أُمُّ عِتْبَانَ and ↓ أُمُّ عَتَّابِ [the latter of the measure<br>\
كَتَّان, accord. to the CK and my MS. copy of<br>\
the K, but in the TA of the measure كتاب, and<br>\
therefore ↓ عِتَابٍ,] the female hyena: (K:) said<br>\
to be so called because of her limping: but ISd<br>\
says, I am not sure of this. (TA.)<br>\
عِتَابٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
five places.<br>\
عَتُوبٌ One upon whom reproof, blame, or censure, does not operate. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  And A road,<br>\
or way. (TA, as from the K [in which I do<br>\
not find it].)<br>\
قَرْيَةٌ عَتِيبَةٌ [A town, or village,] in which is little<br>\
of good, or of good things. (O, K.)<br>\
عَتَّابٌ One who reproves, blames, or censures,<br>\
much, or frequently, [in an absolute sense, (see 1,)<br>\
or] in anger, or displeasure. (Msb.) [See also<br>\
عِتْبٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  أُمُّ عَتَّابٍ: see عِتْبَانٌ.<br>\
أُعْتُوبَةٌ [like أُسْبُوبَةٌ &amp;c.] A thing [meaning<br>\
speech] with which one is reproved, blamed, or<br>\
censured. (O, K.) See 6.<br>\
مَعْتَبَةٌ and مَعْتِبَةٌ: see 1, in three places.<br>\
مَعْتُوبٌ is for مَعْتُوبٌ عَلَيْهِ [i. e. Reproved,<br>\
blamed, or censured; &amp;c.]: Mtr says, it is said<br>\
to signify مُفْسِدٌ [corrupting, rendering unsound,<br>\
vitiating, &amp;c.]; but I am not sure of it.<br>\
(Har p. 77.)<br>\
مُعْتَتَبٌ [is used, agreeably with analogy, in the<br>\
sense of the inf. n. of اِعْتَتَبَ]. El-Kumeyt says,<br>\
الشَّوْقُ مِنْ فُؤَادِى وَالش ↓ فاعْتَتَبَ<br>\
شِعْرُ إِلَى مَنْ إِلَيْهِ مُعْتَتَبُ<br>\
[And desire turned away from my heart, and<br>\
my poetry unto him unto whom was its turning].<br>\
(S, O.)<br>\
مُسْتَعْتَبٌ is used in the sense of [the inf. n. of<br>\
اِسْتَعْتَبَ, meaning] اِسْتِرْضَاءٌ: thus in the saying,<br>\
وَلَا بَعْدَ المَوْتِ مِنْ مُسْتَعْتَبٍ [And after death<br>\
there is no asking, petitioning, or soliciting, favour<br>\
of God]: for after death is the abode of retribution, not that of works. (TA from a trad.)<br>\
