عَوِرَ, (O, K,) said of a man, (O,) aor. يَعْوَرُ,<br>\
inf. n. عَوَرٌ, (S, O, K,) He was, or became, blind<br>\
of one eye: (K:) [or he became one-eyed; wanting one eye: or one of his eyes sank in its socket:<br>\
or one of his eyes dried up: see what next follows:] as also عَارَ, aor. يَعَارُ; and ↓ اعورّ; (K;)<br>\
and ↓ اعوارّ. (Sgh, K.) And عَوِرَتْ عَيْنُهُ, (Az, S,<br>\
IKtt, O, Msb,) aor. تَعْوَرُ, (Az, Msb,) inf. n. عَوَرٌ;<br>\
(IKtt, Msb;) and عَارَتْ, aor. تَعَارُ (Az, S, IKtt,<br>\
O) and تِعَارُ; (IKtt, TA;) and ↓ اعورّت; (Az, S,<br>\
IKtt, O;) and ↓ اعوارّت; (Az, O, TA;) His eye<br>\
became blind: (TA:) or became wanting: or<br>\
sank in its socket: (Msb:) or dried up. (IKtt,<br>\
TA.) Ibn-Ahmar says,<br>\
أَعَارَتْ عَيْنُهُ أَمْ لَمْ تَعَارَا<br>\
[Has his eye become blind or has it not indeed become blind?] meaning تَعَارَنْ; but, pausing, he<br>\
makes it to end with ا: in عَوِرَتْ, the و is preserved unaltered because it is so preserved in the<br>\
original form, which is اِعْوَرَّتْ, on account of the<br>\
quiescence of the letter immediately preceding:<br>\
then the augmentatives, the ا and the teshdeed,<br>\
are suppressed, and thus the verb becomes عَوِرَ:<br>\
for that اعورّت is the original form is shown by<br>\
the form of the sister-verbs, اِسْوَدَّ and اِحْمَرَّ; and<br>\
the analogy of verbs significant of faults and the<br>\
like, اِعْرَجَّ and اِعْمَىَّ as the original forms of عَرِجَ<br>\
and عَمِىَ; though these may not have been<br>\
heard. (S, O. [See also صَيِدَ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَارَتِ الرَّكِيَّةُ,<br>\
aor. تَعُورُ [or تَعْوَرُ or تَعَارُ?], (tropical:)  The well became<br>\
filled up. (TA.)<br>\

↓ عوّرهُ, (K,) inf. n. تَعْوِيرٌ; (TA;) He rendered<br>\

IKtt, O, Msb,) aor. يَعُورُهَا, (S, O, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
عَوْرٌ: (IKtt;) and (more commonly, M) ↓ أَعْوَرَهَا;<br>\
and ↓ عوّرها; (S, M, IKtt, Msb;) He put out<br>\
his eye: (IKtt, Msb: *) or made it to sink in its<br>\
socket. (Msb.) Some say that عُرْتُ عَيْنَهُ and<br>\
↓ أَعَارَهَا [sic] are from عَائِرٌ, q. v. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَارَ<br>\
الرَّكِيَّةَ and ↓ اعارها signify the same as ↓ عوّرها,<br>\
(tropical:)  He marred, or spoiled, the well, so that the<br>\
water dried up: (A, TA:) or he filled it up with<br>\
earth, so that the springs thereof became stopped<br>\
up: and in like manner, عُيُونَ الميَاهِ ↓ عوّر he<br>\
stopped up the sources of the waters: (Sh, TA:)<br>\
and عَيْنَ الرَّكِيَّةِ ↓ عوّر he filled up the source of the<br>\
well, so that the water dried up. (S.)<br>\
-A3-  عَارَهُ,<br>\
aor. يَعُورُهُ and يَعِيرُهُ, (S, K,) or the aor. is not<br>\
used, or, accord. to IJ, it is scarcely ever<br>\
used, (TA,) or some say يُعُورُهُ, (Yaakoob,) or<br>\
يَعِيرُهُ, (Aboo-Shibl,) He, or it, took, and went<br>\
away with, him, or it: (S, O, K:) or destroyed<br>\
him, or it. (K, TA.) One says, مَا أَدْرِى أَىُّ<br>\
الجَرَادِ عَارَهُ I know not what man went away with<br>\
him, or it: (S, O, TA:) or took him, or it.<br>\
(TA.) It is said to be only used in negative<br>\
phrases: but Lh mentions أَرَاكَ عُرْتَهُ, and عِرْتَهُ, I<br>\
see thee, or hold thee, to have gone away with him,<br>\
or it: [see also art. عير:] IJ says, It seems that<br>\
they have scarcely ever used the aor. of this verb<br>\
because it occurs in a prov. respecting a thing<br>\
that has passed away. (TA.)<br>\

عاورهُ الشَّىْءَ He did with the thing like as he<br>\
(the other) did with it: (S:) [or he did the thing<br>\
with him by turns; for] المُعَاوَرَةُ is similar to<br>\
المُدَاوَلَةُ, with respect to a thing that is between<br>\
two, or mutual. (TA. [See also 6.]) ―<br>\

-A2-  اعارهُ الشَّىْءَ, (Az,<br>\

إِجَابَةٌ and جَابَةٌ; (Az, Msb;) [or rather عَارَةٌ is a<br>\
quasi-inf. n.; and so is طَاعَةٌ, and جَابَةٌ;] and<br>\
اعارهُ مِنْهُ; and إِيَّاهُ ↓ عاورهُ; (K;) [accord. to the<br>\
TK, all signify He lent him the thing: but the<br>\
second seems rather to signify he lent him of it:<br>\
and respecting the third, see 3 above.] For three<br>\
exs., see 10. سَيْفٌ أُعِيرَتْهُ المَنِيَّةُ (tropical:)  [A sword which<br>\
fate has had lent to it] is an appellation applied<br>\
to a man, by En-Nábighah. (TA.) [See also 4<br>\
in art. عير.]<br>\
-A3-  أَعُوَرَ (tropical:)  It (a thing) appeared; and<br>\
was, or became, within power, or reach. (IAar,<br>\
K, TA.) One says, أَعْوَرَ لَكَ الصَّيْدُ (tropical:)  The object of<br>\
the chase has become within power, or reach, to<br>\
thee; (S, O, TA;) and so أَعُوَرَكَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
(a thing) had a place that was a cause of fear,<br>\
i. e. what is termed عَوْرَةٌ, appearing [in it]. (Ham<br>\
p. 34.) (tropical:)  He (a horseman) had, appearing in<br>\
him, a place open and exposed to striking (S, O,<br>\
TA) and piercing. (TA.) (tropical:)  It (a place of abode)<br>\
had a gap, or breach, appearing in it: (TA:)<br>\

Msb, K,) and ↓ تعوّروهُ, (S, O, K,) They took the<br>\
thing, or did it, by turns; syn. تَدَاوَلُوهُ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
O, Msb, K,) فِيمَا بَيْنَهُمْ: (S, O, TA:) the و is<br>\
apparent [not changed into ا] in اعتوروا because it<br>\
signifies the same as تعاوروا. (S.) Aboo-Kebeer<br>\
says,<br>\
وَإِذَا الكُمَاةُ تَعَاوَرُوا طَعْنَ الكُلَى<br>\
[And when the men clad in armour interchange<br>\
the piercing of the kidneys]. (TA.) And in a<br>\
trad. it is said, يَتَعَاوَرُونَ عَلَى مِنبرِى They will<br>\
ascend my pulpit one after another, by turns;<br>\
whenever one goes, another coming after him.<br>\
(TA.) One says also, تعاور القَوْمُ فُلَانًا, meaning<br>\
The people aided one another in beating such a<br>\
one, one after another. (TA.) And تَعَاوَرْنَا فُلَانًا<br>\
ضَرْبًا We beat such a one by turns; I beating him<br>\
one time, and another another time, and a third<br>\
another time. (TA.) And القَتِيلَ رَجُلَانِ ↓ اعتور<br>\

man. (Mgh.) And تَعَاوَرَتِ الرِّيَاحُ رَسْمَ الدَّارِ<br>\

from the north, and another time from the east,<br>\
and another time from the west: (Az, TA:) or<br>\
blew over them perseveringly, so as to obliterate<br>\
them; (Lth, TA;) a signification doubly tropical: but Az says that this is a mistake. (TA.)<br>\
And doubly tropical is the saying ↓ الاِسْمُ تَعْتَوِرُهُ<br>\
حَرَكَاتُ الإِعْرَابِ (tropical:) (tropical:)  [The noun has the vowels of<br>\
desinential syntax by turns; having at one time<br>\
رَفْعٌ, at another نَصْبٌ, and at another خَفْضٌ].<br>\
(TA.) تَعَاوُرٌ and ↓ اِعْتِوَارٌ denote that this has the<br>\
place of this, and this the place of this: one says<br>\
هٰذَا مَرَّةً وَهٰذَا مَرَّةً ↓ اِعْتَوَارَاهُ [They two took it, or<br>\
did it, by turns; this, one time; and this, one<br>\
time]: but you do not say اِعْتَوَرَ زَيْدٌ عَمْرًا. (IAar.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  تَعَاوَرْنَا العَوَارِىَّ (tropical:)  We lent loans, one to another:<br>\

ornaments which the children of Israel had asked<br>\
to be lent, or had borrowed]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say<br>\
also ↓ اِسْتَعَرْتُ مِنْهُ الشَّىْءَ فَأَعَارَنِيهِ, (Mgh, Msb, K, *)<br>\
and اِسْتَعَرْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ, (Mgh, TA,) suppressing the<br>\
preposition, (Mgh,) I asked of him the loan of<br>\
the thing [and he lent it to me]. (K, TA.) And<br>\
↓ اِسْتَعَرْتُ مِنْهُ عَارِيَّةً فَأَعَارَنِيهَا [I asked of him a loan<br>\
and he lent it to me]. (TA.) And اِسْتَعَارَهُ ثَوْبًا<br>\
إِيَّاهُ ↓ فَأَعَارَهُ [He asked him to lend to him a garment, or piece of cloth, and he lent it to him]. (S,<br>\
O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  استعار سَهْمًا مِنْ كِنَانَتِهِ (tropical:)  He raised and<br>\
transferred an arrow from his quiver. (TA in<br>\

-A2-  هٰذَا الأَمْرُ بَيْنَنَا عَوَرٌ<br>\
means This is a thing, or an affair, that we do<br>\
by turns. (TA, voce رَوَحٌ.)<br>\
عَوِرٌ (tropical:)  A thing having no keeper or guardian;<br>\
[lit., having a gap, or an opening, or a breach,<br>\
exposing it to thieves and the like;] as also<br>\

in which one fears: (TA:) a place in which (فِيهِ<br>\
[in one of my copies of the S مِنْهُ]) one fears<br>\

in which one fears losing his way and being cut<br>\
off: and ↓ مُعْوِرٌ signifies within the power of a<br>\

(O, K;) i. e., (tropical:)  Verily our houses are [open and<br>\
exposed,] not protected, but, on the contrary,<br>\
within the power of thieves, having no men in<br>\
them: (O, TA:) or it means مُعْوِرَةٌ, i. e., next to<br>\
the enemy, so that our goods will be stolen from<br>\
them. (TA.) See also عَوْرَةٌ, last sentence but<br>\
one.<br>\
عَارَةٌ: see 4: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also عَارِيَّةٌ.<br>\
عَوْرَةٌ The pudendum, or pudenda, (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) of a human being, (S, O,) of a man and of a<br>\
woman: (TA:) so called because it is abominable to uncover, and to look at, what is thus<br>\
termed: (Msb:) said in the B to be from عَارٌ,<br>\
meaning مَذَمَّةٌ: (TA:) [but see what is said voce<br>\
عَارِيَّةٌ: the part, or parts, of the person, which it<br>\
is indecent to expose:] in a man, what is between<br>\
the navel and the knee: and so in a woman: (Jel<br>\
in xxiv. 31:) or, in a free woman, all the person,<br>\
except the face and the hands as far as the wrists;<br>\
and respecting the hollow of the sole of the foot,<br>\
there is a difference of opinion: in a female slave,<br>\
like as in a man; and what appears of her in<br>\
service, as the head and the neck and the fore<br>\
arm, are not included in the term عورة. (TA.)<br>\
[العَوْرَةُ المُغَلَّظَةُ means The anterior and posterior<br>\
pudenda: العَوْرَةُ المُخَفَّفَةُ, the other parts included<br>\
in the term عورة: so in the law-books.] The<br>\
covering what is thus termed, in prayer and on<br>\
other occasions, is obligatory: but respecting the<br>\
covering the same in a private place, opinions<br>\
differ. (TA.) The pl. is عَوْرَاتٌ: (S, O, Msb:)<br>\
for the second letter of the pl. of فَعْلَةٌ as a subst. is<br>\
movent only when it is not و nor ى: but some<br>\
read [in the Kur xxiv. 31], عَوَرَاتِ النِّسَآءِ, (S, O,)<br>\
which is of the dial. of Hudheyl. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A<br>\
time in which it is proper for the عَوْرَة to appear;<br>\
each of the following three times; before the<br>\
prayer of daybreak; at midday; and after<br>\

in the Kur xxiv. 57. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Anything that a<br>\
man veils, or conceals, by reason of disdainful<br>\
pride, or of shame or pudency: (Msb:) anything<br>\
of which one is ashamed (S, O, K, TA) when it<br>\
appears. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also عَوَرٌ. ―<br>\
-b5-  (assumed tropical:)  A woman:<br>\
because one is ashamed at her when she appears,<br>\
like as one is ashamed at the pudendum (العَوْرَة)<br>\
when it appears: (L, TA:) or women. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  Any place of concealment (مَكْمَنٌ) [proper]<br>\
for veiling or covering. (K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  A gap, an opening, or a breach, (T, Msb, K,) or any gap, opening, or breach, (S, O,) in the frontier of a hostile<br>\
country, (T, S, O, Msb, K,) &amp;c., (K,) or in war<br>\
or battle, from which one fears (T, S, O, Msb)<br>\
slaughter. (T.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Sometimes it is applied as an<br>\
epithet to an indeterminate subst.; and in this<br>\
case it is applied to a sing. and to a pl., without<br>\
variation, and to a masc. and a fem., like an inf. n.<br>\
(TA.) It is said in the Kur [xxxiii. 13], إِنَّ بُيُوتَنَا<br>\
عَوْرَةٌ (O, TA) [Verily our houses are open and<br>\
exposed: or, as expl. by Bd and others, defenceless]: the epithet being here sing.; and the subst.<br>\
to which it is applied, pl.: (TA:) but in this instance it may be a contraction of ↓ عَوِرَةٌ; and<br>\
thus it has been read: (Bd:) see عَوِرٌ. ―<br>\
-b9-  Also,<br>\
(K,) or [the pl.] عَوْرَاتٌ, (S,) Clefts, or fissures,<br>\
of mountains. (S, K.)<br>\
عَوَرَةٌ a subst. meaning ↓ عَوَرٌ [q. v.]: (O:) [it<br>\
is mentioned in the S as a subst., and app., from<br>\
the context, as signifying عَوَرٌ, i. e. A blindness of<br>\
one eye: (but expl. by Golius as meaning the succession of a worse after a better:) after the mention of رَجُلٌ أَعْوَرُ, and the phrase بَدَلٌ أَعْوَرُ and<br>\
خَلَفٌ أَعْوَرُ, in the S, it is added, وَالاِسْمُ العَوَرَةُ,<br>\
or, accord. to one copy, العَوْرَةُ; and then follows,<br>\
وَقَدْ عَارَتِ العَيْنُ.]<br>\
عُورَانٌ a pl. of أَعْوَرُ [q. v.]; as also عِيرَانٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
It is also used as a sing.; رَكِيَّةٌ عُورَانٌ meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A well in a state of demolition. (O, K.)<br>\
عَارِيَّةٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and sometimes<br>\
عَارِيَةٌ, without teshdeed, (Msb, K,) when used in<br>\
poetry, (Msb,) and ↓ عَارَةٌ, (S, O, K,) What is<br>\
taken by persons by turns; expl. by مَا تَدَاوَلُوهُ<br>\
بَيْنَهُمْ: (K:) [generally meaning a loan: and the<br>\
act of lending;] the putting one in possession of<br>\
the use of a thing without anything given in exchange: (KT, and Kull p. 262:) the returning<br>\
of the thing thus termed is obligatory, when the<br>\
thing itself remains in existence; and if it has<br>\
perished, then one must be responsible for its<br>\
value, accord. to Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, but not accord. to<br>\
Aboo-Haneefeh: (TA:) pl. [of the first] عَوَارِىُّ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K,) and [of the second] عَوَارٍ. (Msb,<br>\
K.) A poet says,<br>\
وَالْعَوَارِىُّ قَصَارٌ أَنْ تُرَدْ  إِنَّمَا أَنْفُسُنَا عَارِيَّةٌ<br>\
[Our souls are only a loan: and the end of loans<br>\
is their being given back: تُرَدْ being for تُرَدَّ]. (S,<br>\
O.) عَارِيَّةٌ is of the measure فَعْلِيَّةٌ: Az says that<br>\
it is a rel. n. from عَارَةٌ, which is a subst. from<br>\
إِعَارَةٌ: (Mgh, * Msb:) Lth says that what is thus<br>\
called is so called because it is a disgrace (عار) to<br>\
him who demands it; and J says the like; and<br>\
some say that it is from عَارَ الفَرَسُ, meaning, “the<br>\
horse went away from his master: ” but both these<br>\
assertions are erroneous; since عاريّة belongs to<br>\
art. عور, for the Arabs say هُمْ يَتَعَاوَرُونَ العَوَارِىَّ,<br>\
meaning they lend [loans], one to another; and<br>\
عَارٌ and عَارَ الفَرَسُ belong to art. عير: therefore<br>\
the correct assertion is that of Az. (Msb.)<br>\
عَوَارٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ عُوَارٌ (AZ, S,<br>\
Msb, K) and ↓ عِوَارٌ (K) A fault; a defect; an<br>\
imperfection; a blemish; something amiss; (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) in an article of merchandise, (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) and in a garment, or piece of cloth,<br>\
(TA,) and in a slave, (Msb,) and in a beast:<br>\
(TA:) or in a garment, or piece of cloth, a hole,<br>\
and a rent; (Lth, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;) and so<br>\
in the like, and in a house or tent and the like;<br>\
(TA;) and in a garment, or piece of cloth, also<br>\
a burn; and a rottenness: (Mgh:) and some say<br>\
that عَوَارٌ, with fet-h, is only in goods, or commodities, or articles of merchandise. (Msb.) You<br>\
say سِلْعَةٌ ذَاتُ عَوَارٍ, and ↓ عُوَارٍ, accord. to AZ, An<br>\
article of merchandise having a fault, or the like.<br>\

cannot see, the eye being as it were blinded:<br>\
(TA:) ophthalmia; syn. رَمَدٌ; (S, O, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ عُوَّارٌ: (Msb:) which latter also signifies foul,<br>\
thick, white matter, that collects in the inner corner<br>\
of the eye; not fluid; syn. رَمَصٌ: (Msb:) or<br>\
both signify a fluid matter that makes the eye<br>\
smart, as though a mote, or the like, had fallen<br>\
into it: (Lth:) and both signify a mote, or the<br>\
like, (S, O, K,) in the eye: (S:) or (TA, in the<br>\
K “ and ”) عَائِرٌ signifies pimples, or small pustules, in the lower eyelid: (K:) a subst., not an<br>\
inf. n., nor an act. part. n.: (TA:) the pl. of<br>\
↓ عُوَّارٌ is عَوَاوِيرُ, and, by poetic license, عَوَاوِرُ.<br>\
(TA.) One says ↓ بِعَيْنِهِ عُوَّارٌ, meaning, In his<br>\
eye is a mote, or the like. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَيْنٌ عَائِرَةٌ An<br>\
eye in which is the fluid matter called ↓ عُوَّار: but<br>\
when the eye has this, you do not say of it عَارَتْ.<br>\

reason of the narrowness of the place of exit<br>\
thereof. (S in art. كتم.) ―<br>\
