عَشَرَ, (K,) aor.<br>\
عَشُرَ, as is expressly stated by<br>\
the expositors of the Fs and by others, but F,<br>\
confounding two usages of the verb, says<br>\
عَشِرَ,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. عَشْرٌ, (TA,) He took one from ten.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَشَرَهُمْ He took one from among<br>\
them, they being ten. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَشَرَهُمْ, (S,<br>\
K,) aor.<br>\
عَشُرَ, (S, O, TA,) accord. to the K<br>\
عَشِرَ, but<br>\
this is at variance with other authorities, as mentioned above, (TA,) inf. n. عَشْرٌ, (K,) or عُشْرٌ, with<br>\
damm, (S, O,) the former correct, but the latter<br>\
is preferred by MF, who quotes it from the<br>\
Expositions of the Fs, (TA,) and عُشُورٌ; (K;)<br>\
and ↓ عشّرهُمْ, (O, K,) inf. n. تَعْشِيرٌ; (TA;) He<br>\
took from them the عُشْر [i. e. the tenth, or, by extension of the term in the Muslim law, the half of the<br>\
tenth, or the quarter of the tenth,] of their several<br>\
kinds of property. (S, O, K.) And in like manner you say, (TA,) عَشَرَ المَالَ, (Msb, TA,) aor.<br>\
عَشُرَ,<br>\
inf. n. عَشْرٌ and عُشُورٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ عشّرهُ; (TA;)<br>\
He took the عُشْر of the property. (Msb, TA.) It<br>\
is said in a trad., respecting women, لَا يُعْشَرْنَ,<br>\
meaning, They shall not have the tenth of the<br>\
value of their ornaments taken. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عَشَرَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَشِرَ, He added one to nine. (L, K.) [In the<br>\
TA and CK, this signification is connected with<br>\
the first mentioned above, at the commencement<br>\
of this art., by أَوْ, instead of وَ, which latter is<br>\
evidently the right reading.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And عَشَرَهُمْ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
عَشِرَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. عَشْرٌ, (S, O, Msb,)<br>\
He became the tenth of them: (S, O, Msb, K:)<br>\
or he made them ten by [adding to their number]<br>\
himself. (TA.) [See also 2: and see Q. Q. 1.]<br>\
2<br>\
عَشَّرَ see 1, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  عشّرهُمْ, (O, Msb,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. تَعْشِيرٌ, (TA,) also signifies He made<br>\
them ten, by adding one to nine. (O, Msb, TA.<br>\
[See وَحَّدَهُ.]) And العَدَدَ ↓ اعشر He made the<br>\
number ten. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عشّر المُصْحَفَ, inf. n. تَعْشِيرٌ,<br>\
He put, in the copy of the Kur-án, [the marks<br>\
called] the عَوَاشِر [pl. of عَاشِرَةٌ]. (S, O, K. *) ―<br>\

-b5-<br>\
عشّر لِامْرَأَتِهِ, or عِنْدَهَا, He remained ten nights<br>\
with his wife: and in like manner the verb is<br>\
used in relation to any saying or action. (TA<br>\
voce سَبَّعَ.) ―<br>\
-b6-  عشّرت, (S, Msb, K, [in the CK<br>\
عَشَرَت,]) inf. n. تَعْشِيرٌ; (S;) and ↓ اعشرت; (K;)<br>\
She (a camel) became what is termed عُشَرَآء; (S,<br>\
K;) she completed the tenth month of her pregnancy. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And عشّروا Their camels became such as are termed عِشَار [pl. of عُشَرَآءُ]. (O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  See also 4. ―<br>\
-b9-  عشّر القَدَحَ He broke the قدح<br>\
[or drinking-bowl] into ten pieces. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
And [hence, app.,] عشّر الحُبُّ قَلْبَهُ (assumed tropical:)  Love emaciated him [as though it broke his heart into ten<br>\
pieces]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  And عشّر, (A, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَعْشِيرٌ, (S, O, K,) He (an ass) brayed with ten<br>\
uninterrupted reciprocations of the sound. (S, A,<br>\
O, K. *) They assert that, when a man arrived<br>\
at a country of pestilence, he put his hand behind<br>\
his ear, and brayed in this manner, like an ass,<br>\
and then entered it, and was secure from the pestilence: (S, * O, TA:) or he so brayed at the gate<br>\
of a city where he feared pestilence, and conse-<br>\
quently it did not hurt him. (A.) ―<br>\
-b12-  Also He<br>\
(a hyena) cried, or howled, in the same manner.<br>\
(A.) And He (a raven) croaked in the same<br>\
manner. (K.)<br>\
3<br>\
عاشرهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُعَاشَرَةٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
He mixed with him; consorted with him; held<br>\
social or familiar intercourse, or fellowship, with<br>\
him; conversed with him; or became intimate<br>\

-b2-  اعشروا They became<br>\
ten. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اعشرت said of a she-camel: see 2.<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Also She (a camel) completed ten months from<br>\
the time of her bringing forth. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also,<br>\
or ↓ عشّرت, She brought forth her tenth offspring.<br>\
(TA in art. بكر.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And the former, said of<br>\
camels, They came to water on the tenth day,<br>\
counting the day of the next preceding watering<br>\
as the first. (O.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And اعشر He was, or became, one whose camels came to water on the tenth<br>\
day, counting the day of the next preceding water-ing as the first; expl. by the words وَرَدَتْ إِبِلُهُ<br>\
عِشْرًا, (S, TA,) or العِشْرَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And He came<br>\
to be within [the period of] the [first] ten [nights]<br>\
of Dhu-l-Hijjeh (فِى عَشْرِ ذِى الحِجَّةِ). (T, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b9-  And أَعْشَرْنَا مُنْذُ لَمْ نَلْتَقِ We have had ten nights<br>\
pass over us since we met. (L, TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَعَاشَرُوا They mixed; consorted; or held<br>\
social or familiar intercourse, or fellowship; one<br>\
with another; conversed together; or became intimate, one with another; syn. تَخَالَطُوا; (S, O,<br>\

إِعْتَشَرَ see what next precedes.<br>\
Q. Q. 1<br>\
عَشْرَنَهُ He made it twenty: an extr.<br>\
word [with respect to formation, and post-classical, like سَبْعَنَ, q. v.]. (K, TA.) [In the CK,<br>\
عَشَرْتُهُ, and expl. there as signifying I made it<br>\
twenty: but this is evidently a mistranscription.]<br>\
عَشْرٌ fem. of عَشَرَةٌ [q. v.].<br>\
عُشْرٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ عُشُرٌ (TA) A tenth;<br>\
a tenth part; one part of ten parts; as also<br>\
↓ عَشِيرٌ and ↓ مِعْشَارٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;) which last<br>\
is [of a form] not used [to denote a fractional<br>\
part] except as applied to the tenth part (S, O) and<br>\
[in the instance of مِرْبَاعٌ applied to] the fourth part:<br>\
(O:) or, as some say, مِعْشَارٌ is the tenth of the<br>\
tenth [i. e. a hundredth part]: and as some say,<br>\
مِعْشَارٌ is the tenth of the ↓ عَشِير, which latter is<br>\
the tenth of the عُشْر; so that, accord. to this, the<br>\
معشار is one of a thousand; for it is the tenth of<br>\
the tenth of the tenth: (Msb:) [in the TA, “and<br>\
as some say, معشار is pl. of عشير, which latter is<br>\
pl. of عُشْرٌ: ” but this is evidently a mistake:] the<br>\
pl. of عُشْرٌ is أَعْشَارٌ (Msb, K) and عُشُورٌ; (K;) and<br>\
that of ↓ عَشِيرٌ is أَعْشِرَآءُ: (S, O, Msb:) it is said<br>\
in a trad., تِسْعَةُ أَعْشِرَآءِ الرِّزْقِ فِى التِّجَارَةِ وَجُزْءٌ مِنْهَا<br>\
فِى السَّابِيَآءِ, i. e. [Nine tenths of the means of subsistence consist in merchandise, and one part of<br>\
them consists in] the increase of animals. (S, A, *<br>\
O. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَخَذَ عُشْرَ أَمْوَالِهِمْ [means He took the<br>\
tenth, or tithe, or by extension of the term in the<br>\
Muslim law, the half of the tenth, or the quarter<br>\
of the tenth, of their several kinds of property].<br>\
(S, K.) [See 1, and see عَشَّارٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  عُشْرٌ [as a pl. of<br>\
which the sing. is not mentioned], applied to she-camels, That excern into the udder (تُنْزِلُ) a<br>\
scanty دِرَّة [or quantity of milk (in the CK دَرَّة)]<br>\
without its collecting [and increasing]. (O, K.)<br>\
عِشْرٌ A period of eight days between [camels&#39;]<br>\
twice coming to water; for they come to water<br>\
on the tenth day [counting the day of the next<br>\
preceding watering as the first]; and in like manner, the term for every one of the periods between<br>\
two waterings is with kesr: [see ثِلْثٌ:] (S, O:)<br>\
or camels&#39; coming to water on the tenth day [after<br>\
the next preceding period of abstinence, i. e., counting the day of the next preceding watering as the<br>\
first]: or on the ninth day [not counting the day of<br>\
the next preceding watering; for it is evident that<br>\
these two explanations are virtually one and the<br>\
the same]; (K;) as in the Shems el-&#39;Uloom, on<br>\
the authority of Kh, where it is added that they<br>\
keep them from the water nine nights and eight<br>\
days, and then bring them to water on the ninth<br>\
day, which is the tenth from [by which is meant<br>\
including] the former [day of] watering: (TA:)<br>\
after the عِشْر, there is no name for a period between the two waterings until the twentieth<br>\
[day]; (S, O;) but you say, هِىَ تَرِدُ عِشْرًا وَغِبًّا,<br>\
and عِشْرًا وَرِبْعًا, [and so on,] to the twentieth [day<br>\
counting the day of the next preceding watering<br>\
as the first]; (As;) and then you say, that their<br>\
period between two waterings is عِشْرَانِ, (As, S,<br>\
O,) i. e., eighteen days; (S, O;) and when they<br>\
exceed this, they are termed جَوَازِئُ [meaning<br>\
“ that satisfy themselves with green pasture so as<br>\
not to need water ”]. (As, S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The<br>\
eighth young one, or offspring. (A in art. ثلث.)<br>\
-A2-  And A piece that is broken off from a cooking-pot, (K, TA,) or from a drinking-cup or<br>\
bowl, (TA,) and from anything; (K, TA;) as<br>\
though it were one of ten pieces; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ عُشَارَةٌ, (K, TA,) which signifies a piece of anything: (O, TA:) pl. of the former, أَعْشَارٌ [and<br>\
pl. pl. أَعَاشِيرُ]; (TA;) and of ↓ the latter, عُشَارَاتٌ.<br>\
(O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] بُرْمَةٌ أَعْشَارٌ A cookingpot, or one of stone, broken in pieces: thus [we<br>\
find the latter word] occurring in the pl. form<br>\
[and used as an epithet]. (S, O.) And قِدْرٌ أَعْشَارٌ<br>\
A cooking-pot broken into ten pieces: (K:) or a<br>\
large cooking-pot, of ten pieces joined together by<br>\
reason of its largeness: (A:) or a cooking-pot so<br>\
large that it is carried by ten men, (K,) or by ten<br>\
women: (TA:) or [simply] a cooking-pot broken<br>\
in pieces; not derived from anything: (TA:) pl.<br>\
قُدُورٌ أَعْشَارٌ, (A,) and أَعَاشِيرُ. (A, K.) And جَفْنٌ<br>\
أَعْشَارٌ [A scabbard of a sword, or a sword-case,]<br>\
broken in pieces. (O.) And قَلْبٌ أَعْشَارٌ [(assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
broken heart.] (S, K.) And أَعْشَارُ جَزُورٍ The<br>\
portions of a slaughtered camel [for which players<br>\
at the game called المَيْسِر contend, and which are<br>\
ten in number; not seven, as is said in one place<br>\
in the TA. In Har p. 579, اعشار in this case is said<br>\
to be pl. of عُشْرٌ; but I think that we have better<br>\
reason for regarding it as a pl. of عِشْرٌ]. (Az, S,<br>\
O, K.) Imra-el-Keys says,<br>\
وَمَا ذَرَفَتْ عَيْنَاكِ إِلَّا لِتَضْرِبِى<br>\
بِسَهْمَيْكِ فِى أَعْشَارِ قَلْبٍ مُقَتَّلِ<br>\
[And thine eyes did not shed tears but that thou<br>\
mightest play with thy two arrows for the portions<br>\
of a heart subdued and killed by the passion of<br>\
love]: he means, by the two arrows, the two<br>\
called المُعَلَّى and الرَّقِيب; to the former of which<br>\
are assigned seven portions, and to the latter,<br>\
three; so that both together gain all the portions;<br>\
for the slaughtered camel is divided into ten portions: therefore he means that she has played<br>\
for his heart with her two arrows, [alluding to<br>\
the glances shot from her eyes,] and gained possession of it altogether: (Az, S, * O: * [see also a<br>\
verse cited voce رَقِيبٌ:]) or accord. to some, he<br>\
means that his heart had been broken, and then<br>\
repaired like as cooking-pots are repaired: but<br>\
Az says that the former explanation, which is<br>\
mentioned by Th, pleases him more. (TA.) Hence<br>\
the saying, ضَرَبَ فِى أَعْشَارِهِ وَلَمْ يَرْضَ بِمِعْشَارِهِ<br>\
[He played for all the portions of it, and was not<br>\
content with the fifth of it]; meaning he took the<br>\
whole of it. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And أَعْشَارٌ alone means<br>\
Cooking-pots that boil the ten portions [of a جَزُور].<br>\
(Har. p. 579.)<br>\
-A3-  أَعْشَارٌ also signifies The primary feathers of the wing of a bird; (S, O, TA;)<br>\
and so ↓ عَوَاشِرُ. (TA.)<br>\
عُشَرٌ Three nights of the [lunar] month, [the<br>\
tenth, eleventh, and twelfth,] after the تُسَع [q. v.].<br>\
(S, O.)<br>\
-A2-  Also [The asclepias gigantea of Linnæus; or gigantic swallow-wort;] a species of<br>\
tree [or shrub] in which is a substance answering<br>\
the purpose of tinder, (K,) like cotton, (TA,) than<br>\
which there is nothing better wherein to strike fire,<br>\
and with which cushions are stuffed, (K,) on account of its softness: (TA:) [see رَآءٌ, in art. روأ:]<br>\
accord. to AHn, (TA,) a large species of tree [or<br>\
shrub], of the kind called عِضَاه, having a sweet gum,<br>\
(AHn, S, O, *) and milk, (O,) and broad leaves,<br>\
growing up high, (AHn,) from the flowers and<br>\
shoots of which, (AHn, K,) or from the joints of<br>\
the branches and from the places of the flowers<br>\
whereof, (O,) there comes forth a well-known kind<br>\
of sugar, (AHn, O, * K,) in which is somewhat of<br>\
bitterness, (O, K,) called سُكَّرُ العُشَرِ; (AHn, TA;)<br>\
[or this is a kind of red sugar, which falls like<br>\
dew upon this tree; (Golius, from Ibn-Maaroof<br>\
and the Mj;)] it produces also bladders, resembling<br>\
the شَقَاشِق [or faucial bags] of camels, in which<br>\
they bray, [blowing them out from their months,<br>\
with a gurgling sound,] (AHn, TA,) [and] like<br>\
the bladder of the smaller قَتَاد [q. v.]; (S, O;)<br>\
and it has a blossom like that of the دِفْلَى, tinged,<br>\
[but with what hue is not said,] and shining, and<br>\
beautiful in appearance, as well as a fruit:<br>\
(AHn, TA:) n. un. with ة: and pl. [of this<br>\
latter] عُشَرٌ [or rather this is a coll. gen. n.] and<br>\
عُشَرَاتٌ. (S, O.) [See also سَلَعٌ.]<br>\
عُشُرٌ: see عُشْرٌ.<br>\
عِشْرَةٌ Social, or familar, intercourse; fellowship; i. q. مُخَالَطَةٌ; (O, * K;) or a subst. from<br>\
the latter word. (S, Msb.) Sometimes it governs<br>\
as a verb, [like the inf. n.,] accord. to some grammarians, as in the following ex.:<br>\
بِعِشْرَتِكَ الكِرَامَ تُعَدُّ مِنْهُمْ<br>\
[By thine associating with the generous thou will<br>\
be reckoned as one of them]. (I&#39;Ak p. 211.)<br>\
عَشَرَةٌ [Ten;] the first of the عُقُود; (A, K;)<br>\
with ة, (Msb,) and with fet-h to the ش, (TA,)<br>\
for the masc.; (Msb, TA;) and عَشْرٌ, without ة,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) and with one fet-hah, (TA,) for the<br>\
fem. (Msb, TA.) You say, عَشَرَةُ رِجَالٍ [Ten<br>\
men]: and عَشْرُ نِسْوَةٍ [ten women]. (S, O, Msb,<br>\
TA.) [In De Sacy&#39;s Arabic Grammar, for the<br>\
former is inadvertently put عَشْرَةٌ; and for the<br>\
latter, عَشَرٌ; and in Freytag&#39;s lexicon we find<br>\
عَشَرٌ instead of عَشْرٌ.] عَشَرَاتٌ [is the pl. of عَشَرَةٌ:<br>\
and also] signifies Decimal numbers. (M in art.<br>\
ست.) The vulgar make عَشْرٌ masc., as meaning<br>\
a number of days, saying العَشْرُ الأَوَّلُ, and العَشْرُ<br>\
الأَخِيرُ; but this is wrong [unless thereby they mean<br>\
to speak of nights with their days, as will be shown<br>\
by what follows]: the month consists of three<br>\
عَشَرَات; namely, العَشْرُ الأُوَلُ [The first ten nights.<br>\
with their days], pl. of أُولَى; and العَشْرُ الوُسَطُ [The<br>\
middle ten nights, with their days], pl. of وُسْطَى;<br>\
and العَشْرُ الأَخَرُ [The last, lit. the other, ten nights,<br>\
with their days], pl. of أُخْرَى; or العَشْرُ الأَوَاخِرُ<br>\
[The last ten nights, with their days], pl. of آخرَةٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) [العَشْرُ الأَوَاخِرُ is also especially applied<br>\
to The last ten nights of Ramadán, with their<br>\
days: and عَشْرُ ذِى الحِجَّةِ to The first ten nights<br>\
of Dhu-l-Hijjeh, with their days: and العَشْرُ,<br>\
alone, to The first ten nights of El-Moharram,<br>\
with their days.] The Arabs also said, سِرْنَا عَشْرًا,<br>\
meaning We journeyed ten nights, with their<br>\
days; making the fem. [لَيَالٍ] to predominate<br>\
over the masc. [أَيَّام]; as is the case in the Kur<br>\
ii. 234. (Msb.) And أَيَّامُ العَشْرِ is used for أَيَّامُ<br>\
اللَّيَالِى العَشْرِ [The days of the ten nights].<br>\
(Mgh.) [See some other observations applying<br>\
to the syntax of عَشَرَةٌ and عَشْرٌ, voce خَمْسَةٌ. And<br>\
respecting a peculiar pronunciation of the people<br>\
of El-Hijáz, and a case in which عَشَرَة is imperfectly decl., see ثَلَاثَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [عَشْرٌ is also applied to<br>\
A portion, or paragraph, of the Kur-án properly<br>\
consisting of ten verses; but it is often applied to<br>\
somewhat more, or less, than what is considered by<br>\
some, or by all, as ten verses, either because there<br>\
is much disagreement as to the divisions of the<br>\
verses or for the sake of beginning and ending<br>\
with a break in the tenour of the text: (see<br>\
عَاشِرَةٌ:) pl. أَعْشَارٌ. These divisions have no mark<br>\
to distinguish them in some MSS.: in others,<br>\
each is marked by a round ornament at the end;<br>\
or by the word عشر, or the letter ع, over, or over<br>\
against, the commencement.] ―<br>\
-b3-  When you have<br>\
passed the number ten, you make the masc. fem.,<br>\
and the fem. masc. [to nineteen inclusively]: in<br>\
the masc., you reject the ة in عَشَرَة; and from<br>\
thirteen to nineteen [inclusively], you add ة to<br>\
the former of the two nouns; and [in every case]<br>\
you pronounce the ش with fet-h; and you make<br>\
the two nouns one noun, [and, as such,] indecl.,<br>\
with fet-h for the termination: (TA:) you say,<br>\
أَحَدَ عَشَرَ [Eleven], (S, O, Msb,) [and اِثْنَا عَشَرَ<br>\
Twelve,] and ثَلَاثَةَ عَشَرَ [Thirteen], and so on;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) with fet-h to the ش; and in one<br>\
dial. with sukoon [أَحَدَ عَشْرَ, &amp;c.]; (Msb;) or<br>\
the former only: (S, O:) and, as ISk says, some<br>\
of the Arabs make the ع quiescent, [as many do<br>\
in the present day,] saying أَحَدَ عْشَرَ, and so on<br>\
to تِسْعَةَ عْشَرَ [inclusively] except in the instance<br>\
of اِثْنَا عَشَرَ and اِثْنَىْ عَشَرَ, because of the quiescence<br>\
of the ا and ى; and Akh says that they make<br>\
the ع quiescent because the noun is long and its<br>\
vowels are many: (S, O) in the fem., you add<br>\
ة to the latter of the two nouns, and reject the ة<br>\
in the former of them, and make the ش in عشرة<br>\
quiescent: you say إِحْدَى عَشْرَةَ (TA,) [and اِثْنَتَا<br>\
عَشْرَةَ,] and so on to تِسْعَ عَشْرَةَ [inclusively]: and<br>\
if you choose, you say إِحْدَى عَشِرَةَ, [&amp;c.,] with<br>\
kesr to the ش: the former is of the dial. of the<br>\
people of El-Hijáz, [and is the more common,]<br>\
and the latter is of the dial. of the people of<br>\
Nejd: (S, O, TA:) but fet-h to the ش in this<br>\
case is unknown to the grammarians and lexicologists, as Az says, though an instance has<br>\
been adduced in an unusual reading of the Kur<br>\
ii. 57, and another in vii. 160. (TA.) Every<br>\
noun of number, from eleven to nineteen [inclusively], is mansoob, [or more properly speaking,<br>\
each of the two nouns of which it is composed is<br>\
indecl., with fet-h,] in the cases of refa and nasb<br>\
and khafd, except that of twelve; for اِثْنَا and اِثْنَتَا<br>\
are decl. [i. e. you say, in a case of nasb or khafd,<br>\
اِثْنَىْ عَشَرَ and اِثْنَتَىْ عَشْرَةَ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [In the<br>\
same manner also عَشَرَ and عَشْرَةَ are used in the<br>\
ordinal compounds,]<br>\
عُشَرَآءُ A she-camel that has been ten months<br>\
pregnant, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) from the day of<br>\
her having been covered by the stallion: she then<br>\
ceases to be [of those] called مَخَاضً, and she is<br>\
called عشرا until she brings forth, and also after<br>\
she has brought forth, (S, O,) or when she has<br>\
brought forth, at the completion of a year: or<br>\
when she has brought forth she is termed عَاتِذٌ:<br>\
(TA:) or that has been eight months pregnant:<br>\
or, applied to a she-camel, i. q. نُفَسَآءُ applied to a<br>\
woman: (K:) it is applied also to any female<br>\
that is pregnant, but mostly to the female of the<br>\
horse and camel: (IAth:) it is the only sing.<br>\
word of this measure, which is a pl. measure,<br>\
except نُفَسَآءُ: (MF:) the dual is عُشَرَاوَانِ: (S,<br>\
O, TA; in one copy of the S عُشْرَاوَانِ:) and pl.<br>\
عُشَرَاوَاتٌ; (S, O, K, TA; in one copy of the S,<br>\
and in the CK عُشْراوات;) but some disallow<br>\
this; (MF;) and عِشَارٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;) like as<br>\
نِفَاسٌ is pl. of نُفَسَآءُ; (Msb;) and عُشَارٌ: (K in<br>\
art. نفس:) or عِشَارٌ is applied to she-camels until<br>\
some of them have brought forth and others are<br>\
expected to bring forth. (K.) Some say that<br>\
عِشَار have no milk; though El-Farezdak applies<br>\
this term to camels that are milked, because of<br>\
their having recently brought forth; and it is<br>\
said that camels are most precious to their owners<br>\
when they are عشار. (TA.) عَشَائِرُ, as pl. of عِشَارٌ,<br>\
which is pl. of عُشَرَآءُ, signifies Gazelles that have<br>\
recently brought forth. (O.)<br>\
لَبَنٌ عُشَرِىٌّ Milk of camels that feed upon the<br>\
عُشَر, q. v. (TA.)<br>\
عِشْرُونَ Twenty; twice ten: (K:) applied alike<br>\
to a masc. and a fem.: (Msb:) you say عِشْرُونَ<br>\
رَجُلًا [Twenty men], and عِشْرُونَ امْرَأَةً [Twenty<br>\
women: the noun following it being in the accus.<br>\
case as a specificative]: (TA:) it is decl. with<br>\
و and ى [like a pl. formed by the addition of و<br>\
and ن]; (Msb;) and when you prefix it to<br>\
another noun, making it to govern the latter in<br>\
the gen. case, you drop the ن, (S, Msb,) and<br>\
say, عِشْرُو زَيْدٍ [The twenty of Zeyd], (Msb,) and<br>\
عِشْرُوكَ [Thy twenty], (S, O, Msb,) and عِشُرِىّ<br>\
[My twenty], changing the و into ى [in this last<br>\
case], because of the letter following it, and these<br>\
incorporating: (S, O:) so says Ks; but most<br>\
disallow this mode of prefixing in the case of a<br>\
decimal number [of this kind], (Msb.) [It signifies also Twentieth.] It is not a pl. of عَشَرَةٌ, (so<br>\
in a copy of the S and in the O and in the TA.)<br>\
or عَشْرٌ, (so in another copy of the S,) [or perhaps<br>\
the right reading is عِشْرٌ, as may be inferred from<br>\
what will be presently added: but first it should<br>\
be observed that if it were pl. of عَشَرَةٌ, or of عَشْرٌ,<br>\
it would signify at least three times ten: some<br>\
hold it to be a pl. of عِشْرٌ, saying, (TA.) as عِشْرٌ<br>\
signifies camels&#39; coming to water on the ninth<br>\
day, they do not say عِشْرَانِ [for twenty], but<br>\
they say عِشْرُونَ, (in the K, لَمْ يُقَلْ عِشْرَيْنِ وَقَالُوا<br>\
عِشْرِينَ: but the correct reading seems to be لَمْ<br>\
يَقُولُوا: TA: [in the CK it is more incorrect, لم<br>\
يقل عِشْرِينَ وقالوا عِشْرَيْنِ:]) making eighteen<br>\
days to be عِشْرَانِ, and the nineteenth and twentieth a portion of the third عِشْر; and so, [regarding the portion as a whole,] forming the pl.<br>\
عِشْرُونَ; (K, * TA;) agreeably with a well-known<br>\
license, which allows the calling two and a part<br>\
of the third a pl: (TA:) this is the opinion of<br>\
Kh and IDrd and some others: but J and most<br>\
of the lexicologists hold that عِشْرُونَ is not a pl.<br>\
of عَشَرَةٌ nor of عِشْرٌ nor of any other word, and<br>\
their opinion I hold to be correct, applying as<br>\
it does to the other similar nouns of number.<br>\
(MF.)<br>\
عُشَارَ Ten and ten; [or ten and ten together; or<br>\
ten at a time and ten at a time;] (MF;) changed<br>\
from عَشَرَة, (S,) or rather عَشَرَةً عَشَرَةً; as also<br>\
↓ مَعْشَرَ; (MF;) [for which reason, and its<br>\
having the quality of an epithet, each is imperfectly decl.] You say, جَاؤُوا عُشَارَ عُشَارَ, (S, M,<br>\
O, L, K,) and ↓ مَعْشَرَ مَعْشَرَ, (M, O, L, K,) and<br>\
عُشَارَ once, and ↓ مَعْشَرَ once, (M, L, TA,) They<br>\
came ten [and] ten. (S, M, O, L, K.) MF says<br>\
that the repetition is manifestly wrong; but it is<br>\
allowed by the M and L, as well as the K; [and<br>\
is for the purpose of corroboration;] and مَعْشَرَ<br>\
↓ مَعْشَرَ is also authorized by the TS. (TA.)<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd says that more than أُحَادَ and ثُنَآءَ and<br>\

the punishment of the عَشَّار, or عَاشِر, is mentioned<br>\
in traditions, as where it is said that the عَاشِر is to<br>\
be put to death, the meaning is, he who takes the<br>\
tenth as the people in the Time of Ignorance used<br>\
to do: such is to be put to death because of his<br>\
unbelief; or because, being a Muslim, he holds<br>\
this practice to be lawful: but such as performed<br>\
the like office for the Prophet and for the Khaleefehs after him may be thus called because of the<br>\
relation of what he takes to the tenth, as the<br>\
quarter of the tenth, and the half of the tenth,<br>\
and as he takes the tenth wholly of the produce<br>\
that is watered [only] by the rain, and the tenth<br>\
of the property in merchandise [of foreigners, and<br>\
half the tenth of that] of non-Muslim subjects.<br>\

تسع;) and AZ says that by the ninth may be<br>\
meant the tenth; after the same manner as the<br>\
term عِشْرٌ, relating to camels&#39; coming to water, is<br>\

means the coming to water on the tenth day,<br>\

company, or collective body, whose state of circumstances is one; a community; as the معشر of the<br>\
Muslims and that of the Polytheists: (Lth:) or<br>\
a great company, or collective body; so called<br>\
[from عَشَرَةٌ,] because they are many; for عشرة is<br>\
that large and perfect number after which there<br>\
is no number but what is composed of the units<br>\
comprised in it: (MF:) or the family of a man:<br>\
or jinn (i. e. genii) and mankind: (K: [or the<br>\
author of the K may mean, or jinn: and also<br>\
mankind:]) in the Kur [vi. 130, and lv. 33], we<br>\
find the expression يَا مَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالْإِنْسِ; but this<br>\
means O معشر consisting of the jinn and of mankind: and [vi. 128], يَا مَعْشَرَ الجِنِّ, without the<br>\
mention of الانس: (MF:) pl. مَعَاشِرُ. (S, Msb.)<br>\
