Q. 2<br>\
تَعَثْكَلَ العِذْقُ The عذق [or raceme of a<br>\
palm-tree or of dates] had many شَمَارِيخ [or<br>\
fruit-stalks, also called عَثَاكِيل, whence the verb].<br>\
(S, TA.)<br>\
عِثْكَالٌ and ↓ عُثْكُولٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
↓ عُثْكُولَةٌ (K) i. q. شِمْرَاخٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
شُمْرُوخٌ, (Msb,) i. e. [A fruit-stalk of the raceme<br>\
of a palm-tree; or] a stalk, of a كِبَاسَة, upon<br>\
which are the ripening dates: (S, O:) or [so in<br>\
some copies of the K and in the TA, but in other<br>\
copies of the K “ and,”] i. q. عِذْقٌ [i. e. a raceme<br>\
of a palm-tree or of dates]; (K;) [i. e.] an عُنْقُود<br>\
of a palm-tree, of which the شِمْرَاخ is a single<br>\
branching stalk: (Mgh:) [agreeably with this<br>\
last explanation and the latter of the two here<br>\
given from the K, it is said,] and it is, in relation<br>\
to the palm-tree, like the عُنْقُود in relation to the<br>\
grape-vine: (S, O:) and in one dial., the ع is<br>\
changed into ء, so that one says إِثْكَالٌ [and<br>\
أُثْكُولٌ]: the pl. is عَثَاكِيلُ. (Msb.) It is said in<br>\
a trad., خُذُوا عِثْكَالًا فِيهِ مِائَةُ شِمْرَاخٍ فَاضْرِبُوهُ بِهَا<br>\
ضَرْبَةً [i. e. Take ye a raceme of a palm-tree in<br>\
which are a hundred fruit-stalks, and strike him<br>\
therewith a single stroke]. (O.)<br>\
عُثْكُولٌ: see the next preceding paragraph: ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
and that here following.<br>\
عُثْكُولَةٌ: see عِثْكَالٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K,) and ↓ عُثْكُولٌ,<br>\
(TA,) (assumed tropical:)  A kind of pendant, of عِهْن [i. e. wool,<br>\
or dyed wool], or some [other] ornament, (K, TA,)<br>\
suspended to a هودج [or women&#39;s camel-vehicle],<br>\
(TA,) so as to dangle in the air: (K, TA:) pl.<br>\
عَثَاكِلُ occurring in a verse [by poetic license for<br>\
عَثَاكِيلُ]. (TA.)<br>\
عِدْقٌ مُعَثْكَلٌ [A raceme of a palm-tree or of<br>\
dates] having many شَمَارِيخ [or fruit-stalks].<br>\
(TA.) [See also the following paragraph.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And, by way of comparison [thereto], هَوْدَجْ<br>\
مُعَثْكَلٌ (assumed tropical:)  A هودج [or women&#39;s camel-vehicle]<br>\
having much wool [in the form of pendants, suspended to it]. (TA.)<br>\

tree or of dates] having عَثَاكِيل [i. e. fruit-stalks].<br>\
