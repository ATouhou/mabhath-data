the K,) or عَسَرَ, (as in the TA,) inf. n. عُسْرٌ, (TA,)<br>\

تَعْسِيرٌ, (see ناقة عَسِيرٌ, voce عَسِرٌ,)] she (a camel)<br>\
raised her tail in her running. (K, TA.) [In the<br>\
former case, the action denotes repugnance to the<br>\
stallion: in the latter, a degree of refractoriness:<br>\
in both, difficulty.]<br>\
-A2-  عَسَرَ الغَرِيمَ, aor.<br>\
عَسِرَ and<br>\

(O, Msb, K;) He demanded the debt of the<br>\
debtor, it being difficult to him to pay it: (S, O,<br>\

O, L, K, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
عَسَّرَ see 1, in four places: and see 4.<br>\
3<br>\
عاسرهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُعَاسَرَةٌ, (S, O,) He<br>\
treated him, or behaved towards him, with hardness, harshness, or ill-nature; (S, * O, * K;) مُعَاسَرَةٌ<br>\
is the contr. of مُيَاسَرَةٌ. (S, O.)<br>\
4<br>\
اعسر, (S, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. إِعْسَارْ, (Kr, Mgh,<br>\
&amp;c.,) and, accord. to Kr, عُسْرٌ; but correctly, the<br>\
former is an inf. n., and عُسْرَةٌ is a simple subst.;<br>\
[as is also عُسْرٌ;] (TA;) He was, or became, in<br>\
a state of difficulty; possessing little power or<br>\
wealth: (TA:) he became poor: (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K:) he lost his property. (S, O.) عَسَارٌ in the<br>\
sense of إِعْسَارٌ is a pure mistake. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
اعسرت She (a woman) had, or experienced, difficulty in bringing forth; (Lth, S, O, K;) as also<br>\
↓ عَسَرَتْ. (O, TA.) You say, in praying for a<br>\
woman in labour, أَيْسَرَتْ وَأَذْكَرَتْ (Lth, A) May<br>\
she have an easy birth, and may she bring forth<br>\
a male child: (Lth, O:) and in the contr. case<br>\
you say, أَعْسَرَتْ وَآنَثَتْ [May she have a difficult<br>\
birth, and may she bring forth a female child].<br>\
(Lth, A, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And in like manner, She (a<br>\
camel) had difficulty in bringing forth, her young<br>\
one sticking fast at the time of the birth. (O,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And She (a camel) did not conceive<br>\
during her year [after she had been covered];<br>\
(K, * TA;) as also ↓ عُسِّرَتْ, in the pass. form.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اعسر الغَرِيمَ: see عَسَرَ.<br>\
5<br>\
تعسّر: see 1, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  It (spun<br>\
thread, غَزْلٌ, in the K قَوْلٌ [speech], but this is a<br>\
mistake, TA) became entangled, so that it could<br>\
not be unravelled; as also تغسّر, with the pointed<br>\
غ: so accord. to Lth, as related by Az, who<br>\
confirms it as of the language of the Arabs: but<br>\
Sgh, in the TS [and O], says, You say of a<br>\
thing, when it has become difficult, استعسر and<br>\
تعسّر; but of spun thread, when it has become<br>\
entangled, so that it cannot be unravelled, تغسّر,<br>\
with the pointed غ; not with the unpointed ع,<br>\
unless using a forced, or constrained, mode of<br>\
speech. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَعَاسَرَا [They were difficult, or hard, each<br>\
with the other; they treated, or behaved towards,<br>\
each other with hardness, harshness, or illnature;]<br>\
they disagreed, each with the other; said of a<br>\
buyer and seller, and of a husband and wife;<br>\
(TA;) تَعَاسُرٌ is the contr. of تَيَاسُرٌ: (S, O:) see<br>\
Kur lxv. 6. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, in two places.<br>\
8<br>\
اعتسرهُ in the sense of اقتسرهُ: see عَسَرَهُ. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
اعتسر النَّاقَةَ He rode the she-camel before she was<br>\
trained, (S, A, O,) while she was difficult to<br>\
manage: (A:) or he took her in the first stage of<br>\
her training, while yet difficult to manage, and<br>\
attached her rein to her nose, and rode her. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Hence, اعتسر الكَلَامَ (tropical:)  He uttered the speech<br>\
without premeditation; without measuring and<br>\
preparing it in his mind. (Az, A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اعتسر مِنْ<br>\
مَالِ وَلَدِهِ He took of the property of his son, or<br>\
child, or children, against the wish of the latter:<br>\
(S, O, K:) so occurring in a trad., with س;<br>\
from الاعتسار signifying “ the act of forcing, or<br>\
compelling: ” but accord. to one relation of that<br>\
trad., it is with ص. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَعْسَرَ see 1, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  استعسرهُ He sought,<br>\
or desired, or demanded, that in which he experienced, or would experience, difficulty. (O, K.)<br>\
عَسْرٌ, or العَسْرُ: see عِسْرٌ, in two places.<br>\
عُسْرٌ and ↓ عُسُرٌ (S, A, O, K) and ↓ عَسَرٌ (S, A,<br>\
K) and ↓ مَعْسُورٌ [respecting which, as well as<br>\
some other words here mentioned, see below, in<br>\
this paragraph, and see what is said of its contr.<br>\
مَيْسُورٌ, voce يُسْرٌ,] and ↓ عُسْرَةٌ and ↓ مَعْسَرَةٌ and<br>\
↓ مَعْسُرَةٌ and ↓ عُسْرَى [all of which are app.<br>\
inf. ns., of 1, q. v.,] (K) Difficulty; hardness;<br>\
straitness; intricacy; contr. of يُسْرٌ. (S, A, O,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  &#39;Eesà Ibn-&#39;Omar observes that every noun<br>\
of three letters of which the first is with damm<br>\
and the second quiescent is pronounced by some<br>\
of the Arabs with the second movent like the<br>\
first; as عُسْرٌ and عُسُرٌ, and رُحْمٌ and رُحُمٌ, and حُلْمٌ<br>\
and حُلُمٌ. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is said in the Kur<br>\
[lxv. 7], سَيَجْعَلُ اللّٰهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْرًا [God will give,<br>\
after difficulty, ease]. (O, TA.) And again,<br>\
[xciv. 5 and 6,] فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا مَعَ الْعُسْرِ<br>\
يُسْرًا [And verily with difficulty shall be ease:<br>\
verily with difficulty shall be ease]: on reciting<br>\
which, Ibn-Mes&#39;ood said, لَنْ يَغْلِبَ عُسْرٌ يُسْرَيْنِ<br>\
[A difficulty will not predominate over twofold<br>\
ease], which, says Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, is meant as an<br>\
explanation of the words of the Kur immediately<br>\
preceding it, agreeably with a rule mentioned by<br>\
Fr [and applying to most cases, but not to all]:<br>\
for العسر being mentioned, and then repeated with<br>\
ال, the latter is known to be the same as the<br>\
former; and يسرا being mentioned, and repeated<br>\
without ال, the latter is known to be different<br>\
from the former. (O, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It is also said,<br>\
لَوْ دَخَلَ العُسْرُ جُحْرًا لَدَخَلَ اليُسْرُ عَلَيْهِ [If difficulty<br>\
were to enter a burrow in the ground, ease would<br>\
enter upon it]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  As to ↓ مَعْسُورٌ, it is the<br>\
contr. of مَيْسُورٌ, and both are inf. ns.: (S, O:) or<br>\
they are put in the places of عُسْرٌ and يُسْرٌ: (TA:)<br>\
or accord. to Sb, they both are epithets; for he<br>\
holds that there is no inf. n. of the measure<br>\
مَفْعُولٌ; and the saying دَعْهُ إِلَى مَيْسُورِهِ وَإِلَى<br>\
مَعْسُورِهِ is expl. as signifying Leave thou him to<br>\
a thing in which he experiences ease, and to a<br>\
thing in which he experiences difficulty: and<br>\
مَعْقُولٌ is also expl. in like manner. (S, O.) [In<br>\
like manner also,] فُلَانٍ ↓ بَلَغْتُ مَعْسُورَ [may be<br>\
expl. as signifying I effected a thing in which such<br>\
a one experienced difficulty; meaning I treated<br>\
such a one with hardness, harshness, or illnature;<br>\
being] said when thou hast not treated the person<br>\
of whom thou speakest with gentleness, graciousness, courtesy, or civility. (O, TA.) You also<br>\
say, [using معسور and its contr. ميسور as epithets,]<br>\
↓ خُذٌ مَيْسُورَهُ وَدَعٌ مَعْسُورَهُ [Take thou what is easy<br>\
thereof, and leave thou what is difficult thereof].<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b6-  عُسْرٌ also signifies Poverty: (Msb:) and<br>\
↓ عُسْرَةٌ, [the same: or] littleness of possessions, of<br>\
property, of wealth, or of power: (S, TA:) and<br>\
↓ مَعْسَرَةٌ and ↓ مَعْسُرَةٌ, [the same: or] difficulty,<br>\
and poverty; contr. of مَيْسَرَةٌ: (O, TA:) both<br>\
inf. ns.: (O:) and ↓ عُسْرَى, [the same: or] difficult things, affairs, or circumstances; (TA;)<br>\
contr. of يُسْرَى: (S, O, TA:) and fem. of أَعْسَرُ,<br>\
applied to a thing, or an affair, or a circumstance.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  ↓ جَيْشُ العُسْرَةِ [The army of difficulty]<br>\
is an appellation given to the army of Tabook;<br>\
because they were summoned to go thither during<br>\
the intense heat of summer, (O, K,) and in the<br>\
season of the ripening of the fruit, (O, TA,) so<br>\
that it was hard to them; (O, K;) and because<br>\
the Prophet never warred before with so numerous an army, amounting to thirty thousand. (O,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  ↓ فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْعُسْرَى, in the Kur [xcii. 10],<br>\
signifies, as some say, [We will smooth his way]<br>\
to punishment, and a difficult case. (O, TA.)<br>\
عِسْرٌ, (S,) or العِسْرُ, (O, K,) A certain tribe of<br>\
the Jinn, or Genii; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ عَسْرٌ, (S,)<br>\
or العَسْرُ: (O, K:) or the first, (S, O,) or second<br>\
and ↓ last, (K,) a land inhabited by Jinn. (S,<br>\
O, K.)<br>\
عَسَرٌ: see عُسْرٌ.<br>\
عَسِرٌ Difficult, hard, hard to be done or accomplished, hard to be borne or endured, distressing,<br>\
strait, or intricate; (S, O, Msb, K; *) applied to<br>\
an affair, or a thing; (S, O, Msb;) as also ↓ عَسِيرٌ.<br>\
(S, A, O, Msb, K.) ―<br>\

calamitous, day; or an unfortunate, or unlucky,<br>\
day. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  رَجُلٌ عَسِرٌ A man having little<br>\
gentleness in [the execution of] affairs: (Msb:) or<br>\
hard in disposition; or illnatured. (K.) [See 1.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  ↓ نَاقَةٌ عَسِيرٌ, (S, A, O,) or ↓ عَسِيرَةٌ, (as in one<br>\
copy of the S,) A she-camel not trained: (S, A,<br>\
O:) or ↓ نَاقَةٌ عَسِيرٌ and ↓ عَوْسَرَانَةٌ and ↓ عَيْسَرَانَةٌ<br>\

S, O, L) and ↓ عَيْسَرَانِيَّةٌ (Lth, Az, TS, O, L) and<br>\
↓ عَيْسُرَانِيَّةٌ, (Lth, Az, TS, O,) but what Lth says<br>\
is not agreeable with the usage of the Arabs,<br>\
(Az, TS, O,) a she-camel that is ridden, (Lth,<br>\
Az, S, O, TA,) or laden, (TA,) before she has<br>\
been trained: (Lth, Az, S, O, TA:) or that has<br>\
been taken in the first stage of her training, while<br>\
yet difficult to manage, and had her nose-rein<br>\
attached, and been ridden: (K:) and the epithet<br>\
applied to a he-camel is ↓ عَسِيرٌ, (K, TA,) or عَسِرٌ,<br>\
(CK,) and ↓ عَيْسَرَانٌ (Lth, Az, and so in some<br>\
copies of the K,) and ↓ عَيْسُرَانٌ (Lth, Az, TA, and<br>\
so, in the place of the form immediately preceding,<br>\
in some copies of the K,) and ↓ عَيْسَرَانِىٌّ (TA)<br>\
and ↓ عَيْسُرَانِىٌّ (K, TA) and ↓ عَوْسَرَانِىٌّ. (S, O.)<br>\

that are agitated in their running, and shake the<br>\

reason of briskness. (TA.) And ↓ نَاقَةٌ عَوْسَرَانِيَّةٌ<br>\
A she-camel that is wont to raise her tail when<br>\
she runs, (TS, O, K,) by reason of sprightliness.<br>\
(O, TA.) In the L, instead of تَعْسِيرُ, preceding<br>\
ذَنَبِهَا, we find تَكْسِيرُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  Also, ↓ نَاقَةٌ عَسِيرٌ,<br>\
(Lth, O, K,) or ↓ عَسِيرَةٌ, (S,) accord. to Lth, (TA,)<br>\
A she-camel not conceiving during her year [after<br>\
having been covered]: (Lth, S, O, K:) but Az<br>\
says that this explanation by Lth is not correct,<br>\
and that ناقة عسير signifies, as expl. above, “a<br>\
she-camel that is ridden before she has been<br>\
trained; ” and so As explains it; and ISk says<br>\
the same. (TA.)<br>\
