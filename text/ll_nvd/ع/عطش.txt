عَطِشَ, aor.<br>\
عَطَشَ, inf. n. عَطَشٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
and sometimes مَعْطَشٌ, (TA,) He thirsted; was<br>\
thirsty: was in want of drink; and it was in<br>\
want of irrigation: عَطَشٌ being the contr. of<br>\
رِىٌّ. (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَطِشَ إِلَى لِقَائِهِ (tropical:)  He longed,<br>\
or desired, [lit. thirsted,] to meet with him: like<br>\
as they say ظَمِئَ. (IDrd, O.) And أَنَا شَدِيدُ<br>\
العَطَشِ إِلَى لِقَائِكَ (tropical:)  [I am vehemently longing, or<br>\
desiring, to meet with thee]. (A.) [See also the<br>\
first paragraph of art. عمى.]<br>\
-A2-  عَاطَشَهُ فَعَطَشَهُ:<br>\

عَطَّشَ see 4.<br>\
3<br>\
عَاطَشَهُ فَعَطَشَهُ [aor. of the latter, accord. to<br>\
general rule,<br>\
عَطُشَ, He vied with him in endeavouring to satisfy, (see 6,) or in bearing, thirst, and<br>\
surpassed him therein]. (O, K, TA. [But whether<br>\
sanctioned by usage, seems to be doubtful.])<br>\
4<br>\
اعطش His camels, or cattle, thirsted. (T,<br>\
S, M, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  اعطش فُلَانًا He made such a<br>\
one to thirst. (O, * K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اعطش الإِبِلَ He<br>\
increased the intervals between the two drinkings,<br>\
or waterings, of the camels, and withheld them<br>\
from coming to the water, (O, K,) or from the<br>\
water on the day of their coming thereto: (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ عطّشها, [in like manner,] he increased their<br>\
thirsting: (A:) or the latter, of which the inf. n.<br>\
is تَعْطِيشٌ, has a more intensive signification than<br>\
the former verb: (O, K, TA:) or it signifies he<br>\
kept them thirsty; i. e., did not water them at all;<br>\
or, watered them little, so that they were not<br>\
satisfied: (TA, voce ثَأْثَأَ:) when a man has been<br>\
accustomed to bring his camels to water on the<br>\
third day, or the fourth, and waters them one day<br>\
beyond that, you say أَعْطَشَهَا. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعطّش He constrained himself to thirst;<br>\
syn. تَكَلَّفَ العَطَشَ. (O, K.)<br>\
6<br>\

in endeavouring to satisfy their thirst, (see K,<br>\
voce تَجَاشَعَا,) or in bearing thirst].<br>\
عَطُشٌ; fem. with ة: see the next paragraph,<br>\
in three places.<br>\
عَطِشٌ (Mgh, O, Msb, K) and ↓ عَطُشٌ (K) and<br>\
↓ عَطْشَان [without and with tenween, as is shown<br>\
by the two forms of its fem., which see in what<br>\
follows,] (S, Mgh, O, Msb) and ↓ عَاطِشٌ (TA)<br>\
Thirsting; or thirsty: (S, TA:) or needing water:<br>\
(Mgh:) or you say, الْآنَ ↓ هُوَ عَطْشَانُ [He is<br>\
thirsting, or thirsty, now]; (Lh, K;) and هُوَ<br>\
غَدًا ↓ عَاطِشٌ [He will be thirsting, or thirsty, tomorrow]; (Lh, O, K;) and بَعْدَ ↓ مَا هُوَ بِعَاطِشٍ<br>\
هٰذَا اليَوْمِ [He will not be thirsting, or thirsty,<br>\
after this day]: (Lh, TA:) fem. [of the first]<br>\
عَطِشَةٌ (O, Msb, K) and [of the second] ↓ عَطُشَةٌ<br>\

K,) which is also used as a pl., (S, K,) and<br>\
↓ عَطْشَانَةٌ: (Lth, O, K:) pl. masc. [of the first<br>\
and third and fourth, and perhaps of the second<br>\
also,] عِطَاشٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and عُطَاشٌ [which<br>\

عَطُشُونَ (TA) and [of the third] عَطَاشَى: (S, O,<br>\
K:) pl. fem. عِطَاشٌ, like the masc., (S, O, K,)<br>\
and [of the first] عَطِشَاتٌ, (Lth, O, K,) but this<br>\
was ignored by Aboo-Leylà, (O,) and [of the<br>\
second] عَطُشَاتٌ (TA) and [of the third] عَطْشَانَاتٌ.<br>\
(Lth, O, K.) Accord. to Mohammad Ibn-EsSeree, ↓ عَطْشَان is originally عَطْشَآءُ, like صَحْرَآءُ,<br>\
the ن being substituted for the fem. ا, as is shown<br>\
by its plural&#39;s being عَطَاشَى like صَحَارَى: (S,<br>\
O:) [but there are many similar pls. of epithets<br>\
of the measure فُعْلَان; as سَكَارَى and غَيَارَى and<br>\
نَدَامَى and كَسَالَى &amp;c.] You say also عَطْشَانُ<br>\
نَطْشَانُ; the latter being an imitative sequent to<br>\
the former, not used alone. (S, O.) And إِنَّكَ<br>\
كَأَنَّكَ عَطْشَانُ ↓ إِلَى الدَّمِ عَطْشَانُ [Verily thou art<br>\
thirsting for blood, as though thou wert &#39;Atshán]:<br>\
(A:) this being the name of a sword of &#39;Abd-ElMuttalib Ibn-Háshim. (A, O, K.) The dim. of<br>\
عَطِشٌ is ↓ عُطَيْشَان, as though from عَطْشَان; and<br>\
↓ عُطَيْشٌ also; but the former is the better. (ISk,<br>\
O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] ↓ عَطْشَان also signifies (tropical:)  Longing; or desiring. (K.) You say, إِنِّى إِلَيْكَ<br>\
↓ لَعَطْشَانُ (tropical:)  [Verily I am longing for seeing thee].<br>\

or in the belly and flanks; like غَرْثَى الوِشَاحِ].<br>\

throughout.<br>\
عُطَاشٌ [Insatiable thirst;] a certain disease,<br>\

permitted to break his fast. (TA.)<br>\
