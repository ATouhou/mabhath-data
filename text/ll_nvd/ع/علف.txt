accord. to Lh: or the pl. of the former is عُلُفٌ<br>\
and عَلَائِفُ: (TA:) accord. to Lth, they said<br>\

their pleasure feed, but which men eat not save in<br>\
case of necessity: and the like thereof in size, of<br>\
the fruit of the عِضَاه, is also termed عُلَّفٌ: what<br>\
is smaller than it, like the fruit of the سَلَم and of<br>\
the سَمُر and of the عُرْفُط, is [properly] termed<br>\
حُبْلَة: the عُلَّف are long, and expanded, or extended: (O:) [it is also said that] عُلَّفٌ signifies<br>\
the fruit of the أَرَاك. (Ham p. 196.)<br>\

الخِبَآءُ: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O:) [the latter appellation<br>\
is app. wrongly identified in the TA in art. خبى<br>\
with الأَخْبِيةُ: what is here meant seems to be the<br>\
group of stars called by our astronomers Præsepe;<br>\
agreeably with the former appellation, and with<br>\
the following statement:] in the مجسطى, [i. e.<br>\
