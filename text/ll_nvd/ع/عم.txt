(TK.) One says, عَمَّ المَطَرُ الأَرْضَ [The rain included the general, or the whole, extent of the land<br>\

عَمِمْتُ [I was not a paternal uncle, and now I<br>\
have become a paternal uncle]: (so in my copies<br>\

-b2-  And [hence,]<br>\
عُمِّمَ (tropical:)  He was made a chief or lord [over others]:<br>\
(S, Msb, K, TA:) because the turbans (العَمَائِم)<br>\
are the crowns of the Arabs: (S, TA:) and when<br>\
they made a man a chief or lord, they attired him<br>\
with a red turban. (TA.) [Hence likewise,] one<br>\

full height, and blossomed, syn. اِكْتَهَلَ, (S, K,<br>\

غم.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And اعتمّ الشَّابُّ (assumed tropical:)  The youth, or young<br>\
man, became tall. (S.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And اعتمّ is said of<br>\
a beast of the bovine kind as meaning (assumed tropical:)  He had<br>\

عِمْ صَبَاحًا, and عِمُوا صَبَاحًا: see art. صبح.<br>\
عَمٌّ A company of men: (S:) or, as some say,<br>\
of a tribe: (TA:) or a numerous company; as<br>\
also ↓ أَعَمٌّ; (K;) this latter mentioned by AAF,<br>\
on the authority of AZ, and said by him to be<br>\
the only instance of a word of the measure أَفْعَل<br>\
denoting a plurality, unless it be a [coll.] gen. n.,<br>\
like أَرُوَى; and he cites as an ex. the phrase بَيْنَ<br>\
الأَعَمّ, occurring in a verse; but Fr is related to<br>\
have read بين الأَعُمِّ, with damm to the ع,<br>\
making it pl. of عَمٌّ, like as أَضْبٌّ is of ضَبٌّ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

One says, يَا ابْنَ عَمِّى and يا ابن عَمِّ (S, L) and<br>\
يا ابن عَمَّ (L) and يا ابن عَمِ, (S, L, [but in one<br>\
copy of the S I find the first three and not the<br>\
last,]) the last without teshdeed, (L,) dial. vars.<br>\
[all meaning O son of my paternal uncle]: (S,<br>\
L:) and Abu-n-Nejm uses the expression يَا ابْنَةَ<br>\
عَمَّا [O daughter of my paternal uncle], meaning<br>\
عَمَّاهْ, with the ه of lamentation. (S.) And one says,<br>\
هُمَا ابْنَا عَمٍّ [meaning Each of them two is a son<br>\
of a paternal uncle of the other]; (S, IB, Msb,<br>\
K;) because each of them says to the other, يَا<br>\
ابْنَ عَمِّى; (IB;) and in like manner, ابْنَا خَالَةٍ;<br>\
(S, IB, Msb, K;) because each of them says to<br>\
the other, يَا ابْنَ جَالَتِى: (IB:) but one may not<br>\
say, ↓ هُمَا ابْنَا عَمَّةٍ, nor ابْنَا خَالٍ; (S, IB, Msb,<br>\

خَالِى, but the latter says to the former, يَا ابْنَ<br>\
عَمَّتِى. (IB.) And [عَمٌّ signifies also A paternal<br>\
great uncle, &amp;c.: therefore] one says, هُمَا ابْنَا عَمٍّ<br>\
لَحًّا [They two are cousins on the father&#39;s side,<br>\
closely related]; and in like manner, ابْنَا خَالَةٍ<br>\

(TA:) and هُوَ ابْنُ عَمِّهِ ظَهْرًا i. e. [He is his<br>\
cousin on the father&#39;s side,] distantly related.<br>\

your paternal aunt the palm-tree]: i. e. [do ye<br>\

-b3-<br>\
And عَمٌّ signifies also Tall palm-trees, (K, TA,)<br>\
of full tallness and abundance and density; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ عُمٌّ signifies the same: (K, TA:) [or so<br>\
نَخْلُ عَمٌّ and عُمٌّ, which is perhaps meant in the<br>\
K: for] عُمٌّ is an epithet applied to palm-trees,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) and is pl. of عَمِيمَةٌ [fem. of عَمِيمٌ].<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And All [herbs such as are termed]<br>\

do they ask one another? in the Kur lxxviii. 1]<br>\
is originally عَمَّا, [for عَنْ مَا,] the ا being elided<br>\
in the interrogation [after the prep. عَنْ]. (S.)<br>\
عُمٌّ: see عَمٌّ, last sentence but one:<br>\

respect of the mode of attiring himself with the<br>\
turban]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And it is vulgarly used<br>\
as meaning A turban itself, like عِمَامَةٌ; and is<br>\
used in this sense in the TA in art. علم: see<br>\
عَلَمْتُ عِمَّتِى near the end of the first paragraph<br>\
of that art.]<br>\

Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, on his mentioning Uheyhah Ibn-El-Juláh and the saying of his maternal uncles<br>\
respecting him, كُنَّا أَهْلَ ثُمِّهِ وَرُمِّهِ حَتَّى اسْتَوَى<br>\
عَلَى عُمُمِهِ [i. e. We were the masters of the<br>\
meaner and the better articles of his property until<br>\
he attained to man&#39;s estate, or to his completeness<br>\
of bodily growth, &amp;c.]; (S;) [or] the meaning<br>\
is, his completeness of stature and of bones and of<br>\
limbs: (TA:) also pronounced with teshdeed [or<br>\
idghám, i. e. ↓ عُمِّهِ], for the sake of conformity<br>\
[with ثُمِّهِ and رُمِّهِ]; (S, TA;) and by some,<br>\

(S, TA,) and tall: (TA:) pl. عُمٌّ, (K,) which is<br>\
applied to palm-trees (نَخِيلٌ) as meaning tall;<br>\
(S;) or, accord. to Lh, to a single palm-tree<br>\
(نَخْلَةٌ), and may be [thus, originally,] of the<br>\
measure فُعْلٌ, or of the measure فُعُلٌ, originally<br>\

عِمَامَةٌ or [a coll. gen. n., i. e.,] these two words are<br>\
of the class of طَلْحٌ and طَلْحَةٌ. (TA.) [On the<br>\
old Arab mode of disposing the turban, see<br>\
خِمَارٌ.] The عَمَائِم were the crowns of the Arabs.<br>\
(S, Msb.) أَرْخَى عِمَامَتَهُ [lit. He slackened, or<br>\
loosened, his turban,] means (assumed tropical:)  he became, or felt,<br>\
in a state of security, or safety, and at ease, or<br>\
in easy circumstances; (K, TA;) because a man<br>\
does not slacken, or loosen, his turban but in easy<br>\
circumstances. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  The مِغْفَر [q. v.]:<br>\

rel. n. of عَمٌّ; as though formed from عَمًى, or<br>\
عَمًا. (S.)<br>\
[<br>\
عَمَّا is for عَنْ مَا when not interrogative.]<br>\
عُمِّىٌّ, like قُمِّىٌّ, (K, TA,) with damm, but in<br>\
the M عم, (TA, [in which this word is thus<br>\
doubtfully written, and has been altered, perhaps<br>\
from عَمِّىٌّ, for قُمِّىٌّ is a word which I do not find<br>\
in any case other than this, and if any word of<br>\
the measure فُعْلِىٌّ were meant, أُمِّىٌّ would be a<br>\
much better instance of similarity of form,]) an<br>\
epithet applied to a man, i. q. عَامٌّ [app. meaning<br>\
Of the common sort; like عَامِّىٌّ]: (K, TA:) and<br>\

see 1, first sentence: contr. of خَاصٌّ]. (Msb.)<br>\

-b3-  Also [A general word;<br>\
i. e.] a word applied by a single application to<br>\
many things, not restricted, including everything<br>\
to which it is applicable: the words “ by a single<br>\
application ” exclude the homonym, because this<br>\
is by several applications; and the saying “ to<br>\
many things ” excludes what is not applied to<br>\
many things, as زَيْدٌ, and عَمْرٌو: and the words<br>\
“ not restricted ” exclude the nouns of number,<br>\
for المِائِةُ, for instance, is applied by a single application to many things and includes everything<br>\
to which it is applicable, but the many things are<br>\
restricted: and the words “ including everything<br>\
to which it is applicable ” exclude the indeterminate plural, as in the phrase رَأَيْتُ رِجَالًا, all<br>\
men not being seen: and the word is either عامّ<br>\
by its form and its meaning, as الرِّجَالُ, or عامّ by<br>\
its meaning only, as الرَّهْطُ and القَوْمُ. (KT. [The<br>\
word in this sense is often used in the lexicons,<br>\
but is expl. in few of them, as being conventional<br>\
and post-classical.])<br>\
العَامَّةُ is the contr. of الخَاصَّةُ [i. e. the former<br>\
signifies The commonalty, or generality of people;<br>\
the people in common or in general; the common<br>\
people; the common sort; or the vulgar]: (S,<br>\
Msb, K:) the ة is a corroborative: (Msb:) and<br>\
↓ المَعَمَّةُ signifies the same as العَامَّةُ: (IAar, TA<br>\
voce سَامٌّ:) the pl. of عَامَّةٌ is عَوَامُّ, (Msb,) and<br>\
↓ عَمَمٌ is quasi-pl. n. of عَامَّةٌ as contr. of خَاصَّةٌ.<br>\
(K.) [And one says also ↓ الخَاصُّ وَالعَامُّ as well<br>\
as الخَاصَّةُ وَالعَامَّةُ, meaning The distinguished and<br>\
the common people; the persons of distinction and<br>\
the vulgar. ―<br>\
-b2-  عَامَّةً means In common, or commonly, in general, or generally; and universally.<br>\
And one says, جَاؤُوا عَامَّةً meaning They came<br>\

greater part of the month. (TA in art. جذب.)<br>\
And عَامَّةُ النَّهَارِ means The whole of the day. (TA<br>\
in art. ادم.) ―<br>\

death to mankind. (TA.)<br>\

عَمَّآءُ: see عَمِيمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, the former, Thick (K,<br>\
TA) and complete [or of full size]; applied in<br>\
this sense to the middle of a she-camel, in a verse of<br>\
El-Museiyab Ibn-&#39;Alas. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also عَمٌّ,<br>\
first sentence.<br>\
مُعَمٌّ مُخْوَلٌ Having generous, (T, L,) or having<br>\
