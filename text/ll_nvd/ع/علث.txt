عَلَثَهُ, aor.<br>\
عَلِثَ, (K,) inf. n. عَلْثٌ, (S, O,) to<br>\
which غَلْثٌ is like in its meanings (K and TA in<br>\
art. غلث) for the most part, (TA in that art.,)<br>\
He mixed it; (S, * O, * K, TA;) as also ↓ علّثهُ,<br>\
inf. n. تَعْلِيثٌ; and ↓ اعتلثهُ. (TA.) You say,<br>\
عَلَثْتُ البُرَّ بِالشَّعِيرِ, aor. as above, I mixed the<br>\
wheat with the barley. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K, TA,)<br>\
aor. as above, (TA,) and so the inf. n., (O, TA,)<br>\
He collected it together, (O, * K, TA,) from different places. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَلَثَ السِّقَآءَ He tanned<br>\
the [skin called] سقاء with the أرْطَى [q. v.], (K,)<br>\
or with any of the trees of the kind called عَلَث<br>\
[q. v.]: accord. to AHn, it is with غ [i. e. غَلَثَ].<br>\
(TA.) [But مَغْلُوثٌ, with غ, is expl. on the<br>\
authority of ISk, as meaning, applied to a سقاء,<br>\
“ Tanned with dry, or with unripe, dates. ”]<br>\
-A3-<br>\
عَلَثَ, (S, O, K, TA,) [or, perhaps, عَلِثَ, like<br>\
غَلِثَ,] as also ↓ اعتلث, (TA,) said of a زَنْد [or<br>\
piece of stick, or wood, for producing fire], It<br>\
failed to produce fire, (S, O, K, TA,) and was<br>\
difficult to use: and the subst. is ↓ عُلَاثٌ [app.<br>\
meaning The quality of failing to produce fire,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (L, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  عَلَثٌ The fighting vehemently,<br>\
and cleaving to fight: (S, O, K:) and so غَلَثٌ.<br>\
(S, O.) One says, عَلِثَ القَوْمُ, aor.<br>\
عَلَثَ, inf. n.<br>\
عَلَثٌ, The people, or party, fought one another<br>\
[or did so vehemently and perseveringly]: and<br>\
عَلِثَ بَعْضُ القَوْمِ بِبَعْضٍ [One portion of the people,<br>\
or party, fought another portion vehemently and<br>\
perseveringly]. (TA.) And عَلِثَ الذِّئْبُ بِالغَنَمِ<br>\
The wolf kept to worrying the sheep or goats. (L.<br>\
[And so غَلِثَ.])<br>\
2<br>\
عَلَّثَ see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  [The inf. n.] تَعْلِيثٌ<br>\
also signifies Confusion of mind: or, as some<br>\
say, the beginning of pain. (TA. [See also 2 in<br>\
art. غلث; and see مُغَلِّثٌ, with غ.])<br>\
4<br>\
أَعْلَثَ see 8.<br>\
5<br>\
تعلّث He, or it, clung, clave, or held fast,<br>\
(O, K, TA,) بِهِ to it [or him]. (TK. [See also<br>\
5 in art. غلث.])<br>\
-A2-  Also He made, or did, [a<br>\
thing] faultily, or unsoundly. (O, K.) [Accord.<br>\
to the TK, one says, تعلّث السَّهْمَ, meaning He<br>\
made the arrow faultily, or unsoundly: but this<br>\
is perhaps a mistake: see 8.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. تَمَحَّلَ:<br>\
(K:) Fr says, تَعَلَّثْتُ لَهُ الذُّنُوبَ is like تَمَحَّلْتُ<br>\
[app. meaning I laboured, and exercised art or<br>\
management, in seeking to do to him misdeeds:<br>\
see art. محل]. (O.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِعْتَلَثَ see 1, first sentence. You say, اعتلث العُلَاثَةَ<br>\
He (a man) mixed the [mess called] عُلَاثَة [q. v.].<br>\
(As, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And اعتلث زَنْدًا He took a زَنْد [or<br>\
piece of stick, or wood, for producing fire] from<br>\
trees, without knowing whether or not it would<br>\
produce fire: (S, O, K:) or he acted unskilfully<br>\
in selecting a زند: (A:) or he took, or made, for<br>\
himself a زند from any tree that he found in his<br>\
way: and so اغتلث, with غ. (AHn, TA.) And<br>\
one says, فُلَانٌ يَعْتَلِثُ الزِّنَادَ meaning (assumed tropical:)  Such a one<br>\
does not select his مَنْكِح [or wife]: (S, A, * O, K: *)<br>\
in which sense also يغتلث is a dial. var.: (TA:)<br>\
and in like manner one says اعتلث [alone], and<br>\
↓ أَعْلَثَ. (So in a copy of the A. [But I doubt<br>\
the correctness of the latter verb; and the more<br>\
so as it is not quite clear whether it be meant to<br>\
be expl. as having this meaning, or as meaning<br>\
It (a زَنْد) failed to produce fire, and therefore,<br>\
perhaps, a mistranscription for عَلَثَ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
اعتلث السَّهْمَ He took [or made] the arrow from<br>\
any of the trees that were before him. (L.) And<br>\
He made the arrow faultily, or unsoundly. (L,<br>\
TA. [See also 5.])<br>\

عَلْثٌ [originally an inf. n.] A mixture; as also<br>\
↓ عُلَاثَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
عَلَثٌ What is mixed with wheat &amp;c., of those<br>\
things that are taken forth and thrown away.<br>\
(TA. [It is used in this sense in the present day;<br>\
as also غَلَثٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also عَلِيثٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also a<br>\
term applied to The [trees, or plants, called]<br>\
طَرْفَآء and أَثْل [or أَسَل (see غَلَثٌ)] and حَاج and<br>\
يَنْبُوت and عِكْرِش: pl. أَعْلَاثٌ. (TA. [See also<br>\
أَغْلَاثٌ, which is somewhat similarly explained.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And A زَنْد [or piece of stick, or wood, for<br>\
producing fire] that has not produced fire. (A.)<br>\
And الأَعْلَاثُ [or أَعْلَاثُ الشَّجَرِ] signifies [also]<br>\
The promiscuous pieces of trees that one uses for<br>\
producing fire, of the [trees called] مَرْخ, and of<br>\
such as are dried up. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And أَعْلَاثُ<br>\
الزَّادِ Such things as are eaten without being selected,<br>\
of travelling-provisions. (O, K.)<br>\
عَلِثٌ One whose origin is referred to a person<br>\
who is not his father [or forefather], (O, K, TA,)<br>\
his lineage being confused; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ مُعْتَلِثٌ. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Firm, or constant,<br>\
in fight. (TA.) [رَجُلٌ عَلِثٌ is expl. in the O<br>\
by the words مُلَازِمٌ لِمَنْ يُطَالِبُ, and in like manner العَلِثُ is expl. in the K; app. meaning A man<br>\
cleaving, or holding fast, applied to such as is<br>\
seeking, or demanding, blood-revenge, or a debt<br>\
or the like; agreeably with what here immediately<br>\
precedes, and with the explanation in the L, which<br>\
is, مُلَازِمٌ أَىْ طَالِبٌ فِى قِتَالٍ أَوْ غَيْرِهِ cleaving, or<br>\
holding fast, i. e. seeking, or demanding, in fight<br>\
or in some other case. See عَلِثَ, of which عَلِثٌ<br>\
is the part. n.: and see also غَلثٌ.]<br>\
عُلْثَةٌ, with damm, (K, but written in the O<br>\
عَلْثَة,) i. q. عُلْقَةٌ [most probably, I think, in the<br>\
sense in which this is used in the phrase لِى فِى<br>\
هٰذَا المَالِ عُلْقَةٌ (q. v.), from تَعَلَّثَ in the first of<br>\
the senses assigned to it above, syn. with تَعَلَّقِ].<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\

places. (O, K.)<br>\

زَنْدٌ] fail to produce fire. (L.) ―<br>\
