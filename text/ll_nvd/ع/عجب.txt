عَجِبَ مِنْهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) [and لَهُ, as<br>\
shown by what follows,] aor.<br>\
عَجَبَ, inf. n. عَجَبٌ;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) and منه ↓ تعجّب, and ↓ استعجب<br>\
منه, (S, O, Msb, K,) which two are syn. each<br>\
with the other, (S, O, K,) and with the first also;<br>\
(S, K;) all signify He wondered at it; i. e. he<br>\
deemed it strange, extraordinary, or improbable,<br>\
said of a thing occurring, or presenting itself, to<br>\
him; (K, TA;) on account of his being little<br>\
accustomed to it: (TA:) or the first signifies [as<br>\
above, i. e.] he deemed it strange, extraordinary, or<br>\
improbable: and ↓ تَعَجُّبٌ is of two kinds; one is<br>\
[the wondering] at a thing which one commends,<br>\
and it means the accounting (a thing) good or goodly,<br>\
or approving [it], and expressing one&#39;s approval of<br>\
a thing; and the other is at a thing that one dislikes, and it means the deeming [a thing] strange,<br>\
extraordinary, or improbable, and discommending<br>\
[it]: (Msb:) or, accord. to some of the grammarians, it signifies the mind&#39;s becoming affected,<br>\
or acted upon, by some excessive quality in the<br>\
thing by which it is so affected; [so that it may<br>\
be rendered the becoming affected with wonder;]<br>\
as when one says مَا أَشْجَعَهُ [“ how courageous is<br>\
he! ”] and أَسْمِعْ بِهِمْ وَأَبْصِرْ [“ how clearly shall<br>\
they hear! and how clearly shall they see! ”]:<br>\
(Msb, MF, TA:) or it is [the wondering] at a<br>\
thing of which the cause, or reason, is hidden,<br>\
and not known: or it is when one sees a thing<br>\
that pleases him, and thinks that he has not seen<br>\
the like of it: (L, TA:) [therefore تَعَجَّبَ مِنْهُ<br>\
may be rendered he wondered at it, and he admired it:] accord. to some, it peculiarly relates<br>\
to what is deemed good or goodly, or approved;<br>\
[though this is inconsistent with the application<br>\
of the grammatical term فِعْلُ التَّعَجُّبِ the verb of<br>\
wonder;] and the subst. derived from it is<br>\
↓ عَجْبٌ: and ↓ استعجب relates to what is good or<br>\
goodly or approved, and to what is otherwise;<br>\
and the subst. is ↓ عَجَبٌ [which is also the inf. n.<br>\
of عَجِبَ]: or accord. to the A and L,<br>\
↓ استعجب signifies he wondered at a thing intensely; or became affected with intense wonder.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [عَجَبًا لِهٰذَا, a phrase of common occurrence, (mentioned in the K voce وَيْبٌ, &amp;c.,) is<br>\
for أَعْجَبُ عَجَبًا لِهٰذَا I wonder greatly, lit. with<br>\
wondering, at this. See also an ex. voce عَجَبٌ,<br>\
last sentence but two.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Of the words in the<br>\
Kur xxxvii. 12, there are two readings, بَلْ<br>\
عَجِبْتَ وَيَسْخَرُونَ and بل عَجِبْتُ ويسخرون:<br>\
accord. to the former, the meaning is, Nay, thou<br>\
wonderest at their conduct, or deemest it extraordinary, [O Mohammad,] and they mock: respecting the latter reading, [which may be<br>\
rendered Nay, I wonder, &amp;c.,] it is observed that<br>\
عَجَبٌ when attributed to God has a meaning<br>\
different from that which it has when attributed<br>\
to men: IAth says that, when attributed to God,<br>\
it is used in a tropical manner, as the causes of<br>\
things are not hidden from Him: or, accord. to<br>\
IAmb, the verb here meams I have recompensed<br>\
them for their wondering at the truth, or their<br>\
deeming it strange or improbable: and in like<br>\
manner it is said [in the Kur viii. 30], يَمْكُرُونَ<br>\
وَيَمْكُرُ اللّٰهُ [lit. “ They plot and God plotteth ”],<br>\
meaning, “God recompenseth them for their<br>\
plotting. ” (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It is also said that عَجَبٌ<br>\
when attributed to God [sometimes] means The<br>\
being well pleased, content, or satisfied. (K, TA.)<br>\
The saying, in a trad., عَجِبَ رَبُّكَ مِنْ قَوْمٍ يُقَادُونَ<br>\
إِلَى الجَنَّة فِى السَّلَاسِلِ means Thy Lord wonders<br>\
at a people who will be led to Paradise in chains<br>\
[because of their deeming themselves unworthy<br>\
thereof]; the verb عجب being here used in a<br>\
tropical sense: or the meaning is, thy Lord is<br>\
well pleased with, and will reward, a people &amp;c.:<br>\
and there are other trads. of the same kind. (L,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  عَجِبَ إِلَيْهِ means He loved, or liked,<br>\
him, or it. (L, TA.) [See a verse cited voce<br>\
عَجِيبٌ; from which it seems to signify lit. He,<br>\
or it, was an object of love to him.]<br>\
-A2-  عَجِبَتْ,<br>\
inf. n. عَجَبٌ; and عَجُبَتْ; said of a she-camel,<br>\
She was, or became, such as is termed عَجْبَآء<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
عجّبهُ, inf. n. تَعْجِيبٌ, He caused him to<br>\
wonder, (S, O, K, TA,) بِالشَّىْءِ [by the thing].<br>\
(TA. [See also 4.])<br>\
4<br>\
اعجبهُ It (a thing, or an affair, or event, TA)<br>\
induced, or excited, him to wonder. (K, TA.<br>\
[See also 2.]) In the following saying of Ibn-<br>\
Keys-er-Rukeiyát,<br>\
رَأَتْ فِى الرَّأْسِ مِنِّى شَيْبَةً لَسْتُ أُغَيِّبُهَا<br>\
فَقَالَتْ لِى ابْنُ قَيْسٍ ذَا وَبَعْضُ الشَّيْبِ يُعْجِبُهَا<br>\
the meaning is, [She saw upon my head some<br>\
hoariness, which I did not hide; and she said to<br>\
me, “Is this Ibn-Keys? ” somewhat of hoariness]<br>\
causing her to have wonder. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And It<br>\
(a thing, or an affair, or event, TA) induced in<br>\
him wonder, or admiration, and pleasure, or joy:<br>\
(K:) or it excited his admiration, or approval:<br>\
(Msb:) or it pleased, or rejoiced, him. (TA.)<br>\
You say, أَعْجَبَنِى هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ لِحُسْنِهِ [This thing<br>\
has excited my admiration, or approval, or has<br>\
pleased me, for its goodness, or goodliness, or<br>\
beauty]. (S, O.) And أَعْجَبَنِى حُسْنُهُ [Its goodness, or goodliness, or beauty, excited my admiration, &amp;c.]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And أُعْجِبَ بِهِ He was<br>\
excited to wonder, or admiration, and pleasure,<br>\
or joy, by it; he admired it, and was pleased with<br>\
it, or rejoiced by it. (K.) You say, أُعْجِبَ<br>\
بِنَفْسِهِ, (S, O, Msb,) inf. n. إِعْجَابٌ, [which is<br>\
often used as syn. with عُجْبٌ, the corresponding<br>\
subst.,] (O,) [He admired himself, (lit. was excited to admiration by himself,) was pleased with<br>\
himself, or was self-conceited, or vain; or] he<br>\
exalted, and magnified, himself; was haughty,<br>\
and proud. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [مَا أَعْجَبَهُ generally signifies How wonderful is it!] ―<br>\
-b5-  مَا أَعْجَبَهُ بِرَأْيِهِ<br>\
[How greatly does he admire his opinion or judgment! or how greatly is he pleased with it! or<br>\
how conceited, or vain, or proud, is he of it!] is<br>\
anomalous [in two respects], (S, O, K,) not to<br>\
be taken as an example to be imitated; (S, O;)<br>\
for the verb here is formed from a passive [and<br>\
augmented] verb [أُعْجِبَ], like as is the case in<br>\
مَا أَشْغَلَهُ; whereas it is the primary rule with<br>\
respect to the verb of wonder that it shall not be<br>\
formed from any but an active [and unaugmented]<br>\
verb. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَعَجَّبَ see 1, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also,<br>\
تعجّب فِى مِشْيَتِهِ [app. meaning He showed<br>\
عُجْب, i. e. self-admiration, &amp;c., in his gait].<br>\
(TA voce تَفَخَّتَ.)<br>\
-A2-  تَعَجَّبَنِى signifies تَصَبَّانِى<br>\
[He excited my desire, and invited me, or made<br>\
me to incline, to ignorant, or foolish, or silly, and<br>\
youthful, conduct, so that I yearned towards him:<br>\
or he deceived me, or beguiled me, and captivated<br>\
my heart]; (O, K, TA;) said of a man: (O,<br>\
TA:) and تَفَتَّنَنِى [in the O تَفَتَّتَنِى, which I<br>\
think a mistranscription, though I do not find<br>\
تَفَتَّنَ elsewhere in the sense here assigned to it,]<br>\
signifies the same. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَعْجَبَ see 1, in three places.<br>\
عَجْبٌ: see عَجَبٌ, in two places:<br>\
-A2-  and see<br>\
also عُجْبٌ.<br>\
-A3-  Also The root, or base, of the<br>\
tail: (S, O, K:) or the part of the root, or base,<br>\
of the tail, of any beast, which the haunch<br>\
encloses, (Msb, TA,) and which is inserted in the<br>\
hinder part of the rump: (TA:) or the root, or<br>\
base, and bone, of the tail: (Lh, TA:) also<br>\
called the عُصْعُص [q. v.]: (Msb, TA:) or it is<br>\
the head of the عُصْعُص: (TA:) or the upper<br>\
part of the عُصْعُص: or the external extremity of<br>\
the spine; and the عُصْعُص is its internal extremity: (Az, L voce قُحْقُحٌ:) it is said in a trad.,<br>\
that every part of a man will become consumed,<br>\
except the عَجْب, (TA,) or the عَجْب of the tail,<br>\
(O, TA,) accord. to different relations; (TA;)<br>\
from which [as a rudiment] he was created, and<br>\
upon which he will [at the resurrection] be put<br>\
together: (O:) i. e. the bone at the lower, or<br>\
lowest, part of the spine, at the rump; which is<br>\
the عَسِيب of beasts: it is said to be like a grain<br>\
of mustard-seed: or, as Z says in the “ Fáïk,” it<br>\
is the bone that is between the buttocks: it is also<br>\
pronounced ↓ عُجْبٌ; and accord. to MF, ↓ عِجْبٌ,<br>\
but no one else says this: and, as El-Khafájee<br>\
says, it is also called عَجْمٌ and عُجْمٌ and عِجْمٌ, in<br>\
this case with the three vowel-sounds. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also (tropical:)  The hinder part (S, O, K, TA) of a tract<br>\
of sand, (S, O,) or of anything: (K, TA:) and<br>\
hence, عَجْبُ كَثِيبٍ i. e. the thin hinder portion<br>\
[of a sand-hill, or of an extended and gibbous<br>\
sand-hill, or of a collection of sand that has<br>\
poured down]: (TA:) pl. عُجُوبٌ, (S, O,) and<br>\
perhaps أَعْجَابٌ also in the former sense [and<br>\
therefore in this likewise]. (TA.)<br>\
عُجْبٌ: see عَجَبٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also a subst. from the<br>\
phrase أُعْجِبَ بِنَفْسِهِ, (S,) or from الإِعْجَابُ;<br>\
(O;) [i. e. it signifies Self-admiration; or selfconceitedness; or] vanity; and pride: (K:) it is<br>\
said to be [a result, or an offspring, of stupidity,<br>\
or folly; or] a redundance of stupidity, or folly,<br>\
which one has turned to what is thus termed.<br>\
(TA.) [Er-Rághib makes a distinction between<br>\
عُجْبٌ and تِيهٌ; as will be seen below, voce<br>\
مُعْجَبٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  Also, and ↓ عَجْبٌ, and ↓ عِجْبٌ, A<br>\
man who is pleased to sit with women, (O, K,) and<br>\
to converse with them, without his doing what induces<br>\
doubt, or suspicion, or evil opinion: (O:) or with<br>\
whom women are pleased: (K, TA:) the pl. is<br>\
perhaps أَعْجَابٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also عَجْبٌ.<br>\
عِجْبٌ: see عُجْبٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and see also عَجْبٌ.<br>\
عَجَبٌ [originally an int. n.] (S, O, K) and<br>\
↓ عُجْبٌ, (accord. to the K,) or ↓ عَجْبٌ, (accord.<br>\
to the TA,) Wonder; i. e. a deeming strange,<br>\
extraordinary, or improbable, what occurs, or<br>\
presents itself, to one, (K, TA,) on account of<br>\
being little accustomed to it; (TA;) or [the effect,<br>\
upon the mind, of] the consideration of a thing<br>\
with which one is not familiar, and to which one<br>\
is not accustomed: (IAar, TA:) for a distinction<br>\
between عَجَبٌ and ↓ عَجْبٌ, see 1, in the middle<br>\
of the paragraph: the pl. of عَجَبٌ [in this sense]<br>\
is [said to be] أَعْجَابٌ; (K;) or it has no pl.:<br>\
(S, O, K:) [this statement correctly applies to<br>\
عَجَبٌ as an epithet; for as such it is app. used<br>\
as sing. and pl., being originally an inf. n.:] but<br>\
El-&#39;Ajjáj has pluralized it, [regarding it in the<br>\
sense expl. above,] saying,<br>\
ذَكَرْنَ أَشْجَابًا لِمَنْ تَشَجَّبَا<br>\
وَهِجْنَ أَعْجَابًا لِمَنْ تَعَجَّبَا<br>\
[They mentioned griefs to him who grieved, and<br>\
they excited wonder to him who wondered]. (O.)<br>\
يَا لَلْعَجَبِ [may be rendered O case of wonder!<br>\
but properly] means O wonder come, for this is<br>\
thy time: and يَا لِلْعَجَبِ [may also be rendered<br>\
O case of wonder! but properly] means O [people,<br>\
or the like, come] to wonder; the noun signifying the invoked being suppressed. (Har p. 27.)<br>\
-A2-  It is also an epithet applied to a thing, an<br>\
affair, an event, or a case; one says أَمْرٌ عَجَبٌ<br>\
[A wonderful thing or affair &amp;c.]; and so<br>\
↓ عَجِيبٌ [which is more common in this sense],<br>\
and ↓ عُجَابٌ, and ↓ عُجَّابٌ: or ↓ عَجِيبٌ is syn.<br>\
with عَجَبٌ; but ↓ عُجَابٌ signifies more than<br>\
عَجَبٌ: (K:) or ↓ عُجَابٌ is syn. with ↓ عَجِيبٌ,<br>\
(S, O,) which signifies a thing, (S, O, Msb,) or<br>\
an affair, or event, or a case, (S, O,) wondered<br>\
at; (S, O, Msb, TA;) or inducing wonder, or<br>\
admiration, and pleasure, or joy; or pleasing, or<br>\
rejoicing; syn. ↓ مُعْجِبٌ; (TA;) and ↓ عُجَّابٌ;<br>\
signifies more than عَجَبٌ: (S, O, TA:) [it is<br>\
said that] عَجَبٌ has no pl.; [app. meaning when<br>\
it is used as an epithet, as observed above;] nor<br>\
has ↓ عَجِيبٌ; (S, O, K;) or the pl. of this is<br>\
عَجَائِبُ [respecting which see عَجِيبَةٌ]; (S, O, K;)<br>\
like as أَفَائِلُ is pl. of أَفِيلٌ; and تَبَائِعُ, of تَبِيعٌ.<br>\
(S, O.) [Being originally an inf. n., it is used<br>\
alike as masc. and fem.:] one says قِصَّةٌ عَجَبٌ<br>\
[meaning A wonderful story: and for the same<br>\
reason, it may, as an epithet, be also used alike<br>\
as sing. and pl.: like عَدْلٌ &amp;c.]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [It is<br>\
also used as a subst. in a pl. sense, signifying<br>\
Wonders, as meaning wonderful things; like the<br>\
pl. عَجَائِبُ, &amp;c.; and it may be similarly used<br>\
in a sing. sense for شَىْءٌ عَجَبٌ or أَمْرٌ عَجَبٌ: but<br>\
when used as a subst. in the pl. sense expl. above,<br>\
it seems to be regarded by some as a coll. gen. n.,<br>\
of which ↓ عَجَبَةٌ is the n. un.; for] one says, مَا<br>\
فُلَانٌ إِلَّا عَجَبَةٌ مِنَ العَجَبِ [Such a one is none<br>\
other than a wonder of wonders]. (A, TA.)<br>\
[Hence, also,] أَبُو العَجَبِ [lit. The father of<br>\
wonders] is a surname of Fortune. (TA.) And<br>\
it signifies also The practiser of legerdemain, or<br>\
sleight-of-hand; syn. الشَّعْوَذِىُّ, (A, TA,) or<br>\
المُشَعْوِذُ: (Eth-Tha&#39;álibee, TA in شعذ:) and<br>\
any one who does wonderful things. (A, TA.)<br>\
And a poet says,<br>\
يَا عَجَبًا لِلدَّهْرِ ذِى الأَعْجَابِ<br>\
[for يَا أَعْجَبُ عَجَبًا O, I wonder greatly, lit. with<br>\
wondering, at fortune that is ever attended with<br>\
wonders]. (TA.) [See also عَجِيبَةٌ.]<br>\
-A3-  Also<br>\
The quality, in a she-camel, that is denoted by<br>\
the epithet عَجْبَآءُ [fem. of أَعْجَبُ, q. v.]; and so<br>\
↓ عُجْبَةٌ. (O.)<br>\
عُجْبَةٌ: see the last preceding sentence.<br>\
عَجَبَةٌ: see عَجَبٌ, last quarter.<br>\
عُجَابٌ: see عَجَبٌ, in three places, near the<br>\
middle of the paragraph: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also عَاجِبٌ.<br>\
عَجِيبٌ: see عَجَبٌ, in four places, near the<br>\
middle of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Loved, beloved,<br>\
or an object of love: so in the following verse,<br>\
cited by Th:<br>\
وَمَا البُخْلُ يَنْهَانِى وَلَا الجُودُ قَادَنِى<br>\
وَلٰكِنَّهَا ضَرْبٌ إِلَىَّ عَجِيبٌ<br>\
[And neither does niggardliness forbid me nor<br>\
liberality lead me; but she is a sort of person,<br>\
to me, an object of love]: by قَادَنِى, the poet<br>\
means يَقُودُنِى. (L, TA.)<br>\
عَجِيبَةٌ (K) and ↓ أُعْجُوبَةٌ (S, O, K) A wonderful<br>\
thing; a thing at which one wonders: (S, O, K: *)<br>\
[the pl. of the former, accord. to modern usage, is<br>\
عَجَائِبُ, mentioned above as pl. of عَجَبٌ: and]<br>\
أَعَاجِيبُ seems to be pl. of أُعْجُوبَةٌ, like as أَحَادِيثُ<br>\
is pl. of أُحْدُوثَةُ: (S, O:) and ↓ تَعَاجِيبُ signifies<br>\
wonderful things; syn. عَجَائِبُ; (S, O, K;) and<br>\
is a word [of a rare form, (see تَبَاشِيرُ,)] having no<br>\
proper sing., (S, O,) like تَعَاشِيبُ; (O;) erroneously thought by the author of the “ Námoos ”<br>\
[on the Kámoos] to be most probably a mistake<br>\
for أَعَاجِيبُ: (TA:) a poet says,<br>\
وَمَنْ تَعَاجِيبِ خَلْقِ اللّٰهِ غَاطِيَةٌ<br>\
يُعْصَرُ مِنْهَا مُلَاحِىٌّ وَغِرْبِيبُ<br>\
[And of the wonderful things of God&#39;s creation is<br>\
a grape-vine covering the ground (so غَاطِيَةٌ is expl.<br>\
by IB), whereof grapes of the kinds called ملاحىّ<br>\
and غربيب are pressed for making wine].<br>\
(S, O.)<br>\
عُجَّابٌ: see عَجَبٌ, near the middle of the paragraph, in two places.<br>\
عَجَبٌ عَاجِبٌ [meaning Very wonderful or<br>\
admirable or pleasing] (S, O, K) is like لَيْلٌ لَائِلٌ,<br>\
the latter word being a corroborative of the<br>\
former; (S, O;) and one says also [in like<br>\
manner] ↓ عَجَبٌ عُجَابٌ. (K.)<br>\
أَعْجَبُ [More, and most, wonderful or admirable<br>\
or pleasing]. ―<br>\
-b2-  [And the fem.] عَجْبَآءُ signifies A<br>\
female wondered at for her beauty: and also, for<br>\
her ugliness. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, i. e. the former,<br>\
A thick, or big, or coarse, camel. (O, K. *) And<br>\
so the fem. applied to a she-camel: (O, K:) or,<br>\
so applied, thick in the عَجْب [or root, &amp;c.,] of<br>\
the tail: (TA:) or whereof the hinder part, (O,<br>\
K,) or the upper portion of that part, (L, TA,)<br>\
is narrow, and whereof the جَاعِرَتَانِ [q. v.] are<br>\
prominent: (O, L, K, TA:) the kind of make<br>\
thus particularized is ugly. (TA.)<br>\
أُعْجُوبَةٌ: see عَجِيبَةٌ.<br>\
رَجُلٌ تِعْجَابَةٌ A man of (lit. having, possessing,<br>\
or endowed with,) wonders, or wonderful things.<br>\
(O, K, TA.)<br>\
تَعَاجِيبُ, a pl. without a sing.: see عَجِيبَةٌ.<br>\
مُعْجَبٌ بِنَفْسِهِ, and بِرَأْيِهِ, [Admiring himself,<br>\
(lit. excited to admiration by himself,) or pleased<br>\
with himself, and his opinion, or judgment; selfconceited, and conceited of his opinion or judgment,]<br>\
(S, O, TA,) [or] vain, or proud, [thereof; for]<br>\
مُعْجَبٌ signifies a man vain, or proud, of what<br>\
proceeds from him, whether good or bad, and of<br>\
himself, or of a thing [belonging to him, such as<br>\
his dress or wealth &amp;c.]: but Er-Rághib makes<br>\
a distinction between مُعْجَبٌ and تَائِهٌ; saying<br>\
that the معجب believes himself with respect to<br>\
the opinion or judgment that he forms of himself<br>\
indecisively from evidence outweighed in probability; [so that it rather denotes conceit than<br>\
vanity;] whereas the تائه believes himself decisively. (MF, TA.)<br>\
مُعْجِبٌ [Inducing wonder, or admiration, &amp;c.]:<br>\
see عَجَبٌ, in the middle of the paragraph: [or]<br>\
a thing that is very good or goodly or beautiful.<br>\
