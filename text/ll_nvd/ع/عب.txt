عَبَّ, aor.<br>\
عَبُ3َ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,) inf. n. عَبٌّ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) He (a man, Msb) drank<br>\
water without taking breath: (O, Msb, TA; and<br>\
T in art. عنث: [this is the sense in which it is<br>\
generally used:]) or he drank water without sipping<br>\
or sucking in (مِنْ غَيْرِ مَصٍّ): (S, O:) thus, (S,<br>\
O, Msb,) in the manner termed عَبٌّ, (S, O,) i. e.<br>\
مِنْ غَيْرِ مَصٍّ, (Msb,) the pigeon drinks water,<br>\
like horses and similar beasts; (S, O, Msb;)<br>\
whereas other birds take it sip after sip: (Msb:)<br>\
or he drank water at once, without interrupting<br>\
the swallowing: AA says, the pigeon drinks thus;<br>\
differing from the other birds; for these drink by<br>\
little and little: (Mgh:) [in like manner also]<br>\
Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee says, the pigeon is a bird that drinks<br>\
in the manner termed عَبٌّ, and cooes; for it does<br>\
not drink like other birds, by little and little:<br>\
(TA:) and it is said in a trad. that the livercomplaint (الكُبَاد) is occasioned by drinking in<br>\
the manner termed عَبٌّ: (S, O, TA:) or عَبٌّ<br>\
signifies [simply] the drinking water: or the<br>\
gulping, or swallowing down: or the doing so<br>\
uninterruptedly: (K, TA:) or the drinking water<br>\
in a single stream, without interruption: (TA:)<br>\
and the drinking with the mouth from a place, or<br>\
vessel, containing water, not with the hands nor<br>\
with a vessel: (K, TA:) you say, عَبَّ فِى المَآءِ,<br>\
and فِى الإِنَآءِ, he so drank of the water, and from<br>\
the vessel: and [accord. to some] one says of a<br>\
bird, عَبَّ; not شَرِبَ: (TA:) [but] Es-Sarakustee<br>\
says, one does not say of a bird شَرِبَ المَآءَ, but<br>\
حَسَاهُ. (Msb in art. شرب.) ―<br>\
-b2-  يَعُبُّ فِيهِ مِيزَابَانِ,<br>\
in a trad. respecting the حَوْض [i. e. Mohammad&#39;s<br>\
pool], as some relate it, means [Two spouts] were<br>\
pouring forth into it with an uninterrupted pouring: but accord. to the relation commonly known,<br>\
the verb is يغتّ, [i. e. يَغُتُّ in this sense, but<br>\
يَغِتُّ in another sense, as meaning the making a<br>\
murmuring sound,] with غ and ت. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
عَبَّتِ الدَّلْوُ, (K,) [aor., app. تَعِبُّ,] inf. n. عَبٌّ,<br>\
(TK,) The bucket made a sound in lading out the<br>\
water. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَبَّ البَحْرُ, inf. n. عُبَابٌ,<br>\
The sea rose high, with multitudinous waves. (A.)<br>\
[Accord. to Golius, عَبَّ said of the sea means It<br>\
had broken waves: but for this he has named no<br>\
authority.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And [hence,] ↓ عَبَّ عُبَابُهُ (tropical:)  His<br>\
speech was continual and abundant. (A.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
عَبَبٌ [an inf. n., of which the verb, accord. to<br>\
general analogy, is app. عَبَّ, first pers. عَبِبْتُ,<br>\
aor. يَعَبُّ,] means [The interrupting in swallowing; or] the interrupting the swallowing. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَبَّ, [aor., app.,<br>\
عَبِ3َ,] said of a plant, It became tall. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [said of a man] His<br>\
face became beautiful, or comely, after having<br>\
become altered. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تعبّب العَبِيبَةَ He drank the عَبِيبَة [q. v.].<br>\
(L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تعبّب النَّبِيذَ He persevered, or<br>\
persisted, in drinking the [beverage called] نَبِيذ.<br>\
(Lh, K.) And He swallowed in consecutive<br>\
portions the نَبِيذ, (A, TA,) and in large<br>\
quantity. (A.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
عَبْعَبَ He was put to flight. (O, K.)<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَعَبْعَبْتُهُ I took it, or devoured it,<br>\
altogether. (O, K.)<br>\
عَبُ الشَّمْسِ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  عَبْ<br>\
عَبْ is said when one orders another to conceal<br>\
himself. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
عَبُّ الشَّمْسِ, (O, K, TA,) as some say, (TA,)<br>\
and الشَّمْسِ ↓ عَبُ, (O, K, TA,) which is the form<br>\
commonly known and obtaining, (TA,) The<br>\
light of the sun: (O, K, TA:) or the light of the<br>\
dawn. (Az, TA.) By عَبْشَمْس as a proper name,<br>\
is meant عَبْدُ شَمْسٍ: ISh says, among Saad are<br>\
بَنُو عَبِ الشَّمْسِ; and among Kureysh, بَنُو عَبْدِ<br>\
الشَّمْسِ. (TA.) [See also عَبْءٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  عَبُّ قُرٍّ is<br>\
for حَبُّ قُرٍّ, meaning Hail. (K in art. حبقر.)<br>\
عُبٌّ i. q. رُدْنٌ, (O, K,) which means The base<br>\
(أَصْل) of the sleeve: (S and K in art. ردن:) or<br>\
the fore part of the sleeve of the shirt: (M in that<br>\
art.:) or the lower part thereof: (M in that art.,<br>\
and Har pp. 149 and 390:) or the sleeve altogether: (M in that art.:) but, as MF says, it is<br>\
a vulgar word. (TA.)<br>\
عُبَبٌ The berries (حَبّ) of the كَاكَنَج or<br>\
كَاكَنْج [thus differently written, from the Pers.<br>\
كَاكْنَجْ], (K,) which, accord. to more than one<br>\
of the leading authorities, is a tree, but is expl.<br>\
by the author of the K [in its proper art.] as<br>\
meaning a gum: (TA:) [what is here meant by<br>\
it is the physalis alkekengi, or common wintercherry: accord. to Forskål (Flora Aegypt. Arab<br>\
p. cvi.) the name عُبَب is applied to the physalis<br>\
somnifera: and also (pp. cxxi. and cxxii. and<br>\
163) to the croton lobatum and croton villosum:]<br>\
or it is applied by the physicians to the [plant<br>\
itself called] كاكنج: (O:) or i. q. عِنَبُ الثَّعْلَبِ;<br>\
(IAar, O, K;) which is said by Ibn-Habeeb to<br>\
be an incorrect appellation, (O, TA,) being correctly عُبَب, but AM denies that the former is<br>\
incorrect: (TA:) or i. q. رَآءٌ; (K;) i. e. the tree<br>\
called رَآء: (TA:) or a tree, or plant, (شَجَرَةٌ,) of<br>\
the [kind called] أَغْلَاث: (K:) AHn says, on<br>\
the authority of Aboo-Ziyád, it is of the أَغْلَاث,<br>\
and is a tree, or plant, (شَجَرَةٌ,) resembling the<br>\
حَرْمَل [peganum harmala of Linn.], except that<br>\
it is taller, coming forth in the form of strings,<br>\
and having pods (سِنَفَة) like those of the حَرْمَل,<br>\
and sometimes the goats nibble from its leaves and<br>\
from its pods when they dry up; it has also<br>\
berries, intensely red, like beads of carnelian,<br>\
smaller than the نَبِق [or fruit of the lote tree],<br>\
and larger than the grape; and people seek out<br>\
the leaves thereof that have not been rendered<br>\
foraminous, which leaves are then bruised, and<br>\
used beneficially as a dressing for maladies attended<br>\
with pain: the people assert that the jinn, or<br>\
genii, perforate them in envy of mankind. (O.)<br>\
عُبُبٌ Waters pouring forth copiously. (IAar,<br>\
O, K.) [It may be a pl. of عُبَابٌ (as Golius<br>\
says), like as قُرُدٌ is of قُرَادٌ.]<br>\
عَبَابِ [a quasi-inf. n., of the class of فَجَارِ and<br>\
حَمَادِ, indecl.]. لَا عَبَابِ [app. as used in the<br>\
prov. here following] means لَا تَعُبُّ فِى المَآءِ.<br>\
(S. [Thus in one of my copies of the S: in the<br>\
other copy the explanation is written لَا تَعُبُّ فى<br>\
الماء, as though عَبَابِ were an imperative verbal<br>\
noun: and so in the O, in which the phrase is<br>\
written لَا عَبَابَ: but بَعُبَّ I think a mistranscription.]) The saying إِذَا أَصَابَتِ الظِّبَآءُ المَآءَ فَلَا<br>\
عَبَابِ وَإِنْ لَمْ تُصِبْهُ فَلَا أَبَابِ means When the<br>\
gazelles find water, they do not drink in the<br>\
manner termed عَبٌّ; and when they do not find<br>\
it, they do not prepare to seek it and to drink it:<br>\
(K, TA; and thus (عَبَابِ and أَبَابِ) accord. to<br>\
the Mz, 40th نوع: but in the CK عَبابَ and<br>\
اَبابَ:) it is a prov., frequently used by the<br>\
Arabs in an abridged manner, لا عباب ولا اباب,<br>\
as in the works of Meyd and others; (TA;)<br>\
and is applied to a man who turns from a thing,<br>\
not needing it. (Meyd.)<br>\
عُبَابٌ The main body of a torrent, or flow of<br>\
water: and the height and abundance thereof:<br>\
(O, K:) or the waves, billows, or surges, thereof:<br>\
(K:) and the first portion (O, K) thereof (O) or<br>\
of a thing: (K:) and the first and main portion<br>\
of water: and the vehemence of running thereof.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] عَبَّ عُبَابُهُ: see 1, near the<br>\
end. ―<br>\
-b3-  It is said in a trad., إِنَّا حَىٌّ مِنْ مَذْحِجٍ<br>\
عُبَابُ شَرَفِهَا وَلُبَابُ سَلَفِهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Verily we are<br>\
a tribe sprung from Medh-hij, the chief of their<br>\
nobility, or nobles, and the purest, or best, issue]<br>\
of their ancestry, or [the purest, or best, inheritors]<br>\
of their ancestral might and glory. (TA: only<br>\
سَلَفِهَا in this saying being there explained.) And<br>\
in a trad. of &#39;Alee, relating to Aboo-Bekr, طِرْتَ<br>\
بِعُبَابِهَا وفُزْتَ بِحَبَابِهَا, expl. voce حَبَابٌ. (TA.)<br>\
And one says, جَاؤُوا بِعُبَابِهِمْ (assumed tropical:)  They came [with<br>\
their whole company, or] all together. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also A خُوصَة [or leaf of a palm-tree &amp;c.]. (K.)<br>\
عَبِيبَةٌ A certain food, (K,) or sort of food,<br>\
(TA,) and a beverage, (K, TA,) obtained (TA)<br>\
from the [species of mimosa called] عُرْفُط, of sweet<br>\
flavour: (K, TA:) or the exudation [or matter<br>\
exuded in the form of drops] of gum; (عرقُ<br>\
الصَّمْغِ; [written in the TA without any syll.<br>\
signs; in the CK عِرْقُ الصَّمْغِ, and so in my MS.<br>\
copy of the K; but in the latter, the former word<br>\
has been altered, app. from عَرَقُ, which is evidently the right reading;]) it is of sweet flavour,<br>\
and is beaten with [the implement called] a مِجْدَح<br>\
until it becomes thoroughly fit for use (حَتَّى يَنْضَجَ),<br>\
[app., from what here follows, over a fire,] and<br>\
is then drunk: (TA:) or what drops, or distils,<br>\
of the exudations (مَغَافِير) of the عُرْفُط: or عَبِيبَةُ<br>\
اللَّثَى, accord. to ISk, is the infusion (غُسَالَة) of<br>\
لَثًى; (S, TA;) لَثًى being a substance which the<br>\
[plant called] ثُمَام exudes, of sweet flavour; what<br>\
falls thereof upon the ground is taken, and put<br>\
into a garment, or piece of cloth, and water is<br>\
poured upon it, and when it flows from the garment, or piece of cloth, it is drunk, in a sweet<br>\
state, and sometimes it is made thick; (S;) or<br>\
لَثًى is a substance which the ثُمَام exudes, sweet<br>\
like نَاطِف [q. v.]; and when any of it flows upon<br>\
the ground, it is taken, and put into a vessel, or<br>\
sometimes it is poured upon water, and then<br>\
drunk, in a sweet state, and sometimes it is made<br>\
thick: (TA:) [or عَبِيبَةُ اللَّثَى is a decoction of<br>\
the matter exuded by a species of ثُمَام; for] AM<br>\
says, I have seen, in the desert, a species of ثُمَام<br>\
that exudes a sweet gum, which is gathered from<br>\
its shoots, and eaten, and is called لَثَى الثُّمَامِ:<br>\
when it has remained for some time, it is found<br>\
scattered at the foot of the ثُمَام, and is taken with<br>\
its dust, and put into a garment, or piece of cloth,<br>\
and cleansed by water poured upon it; then it is<br>\
boiled over a fire until it thickens; when it is<br>\
eaten: what flows from it [or the fluid part of it]<br>\
is called عَبِيبَةٌ: and تَعَبَّبْتُ عَبِيبَةً means “ I<br>\
drank عَبِيبَة. ” (L, TA.) It is stated in a marginal note in the L, that A&#39;Obeyd [is related to<br>\
have] said that عَبِيبَة is “ milk such as is termed<br>\
رَائِب: ” but AM observes that this is a disgraceful<br>\
mistake, and that A&#39;Obeyd is related on the<br>\
authority of Sh to have assigned this meaning<br>\
to غَبِيبَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The [shrub called] رِمْث,<br>\
(K, TA,) on which camels feed, (TA,) when it is<br>\
in a depressed tract of land. (K, TA.)<br>\
عُبَّى A woman of whom a child scarcely ever,<br>\
or never, dies. (Kr, K.)<br>\
عُبِّيَّةٌ and عِبِّيَّةٌ, (S, O, K, TA,) [like أُبِّيَّةٌ and<br>\
عُمِّيَّةٌ and عِمِّيَّةٌ, in the CK (erroneously) without<br>\
the sheddeh to the ب,] also written غُِبِّيَّةٌ, with<br>\
غ, (Abu-l-Hasan &#39;Alee Esh-Shádhilee,) Pride;<br>\
haughtiness: (S, O, K:) and glorying. (K.)<br>\
One says رَجُلٌ فِيهِ عُِبِّيَّةٌ A man in whom is pride,<br>\
or haughtiness. (S, O.) And عُِبِّيَّةُ الجَاهِلِيَّةِ<br>\
means The pride, or haughtiness, of the people of<br>\
the Time of Ignorance. (S, O.) عُبِّيَّةٌ may be<br>\
of the measure فُعْلِيَّةٌ or فُعُّولَةٌ: if the former, from<br>\
عُبَابُ المَآءِ, meaning “ the height of water: ” if the<br>\
latter, [originally عُبُّويَةٌ,] from عَبَّاهُ, without ء,<br>\
meaning “ he prepared it; ” because the proud is<br>\
characterized by affectation and preparation. (O.)<br>\
عَبَّابٌ [app. One that drinks in the manner<br>\
termed عَبٌّ]. بَنُو العَبَّابِ is an appellation of a<br>\
people of the Arabs who were thus called because<br>\
they intermixed with the Persians so that their<br>\
horses drank (عَبَّتْ, K, TA, i. e. شَرِبَتْ, TA) of<br>\
the water of the Euphrates. (K, * TA.)<br>\

youth: (O:) or i. q. شَابٌّ مُمْتَلِئٌ, (K, TA,)<br>\
meaning مُمْتَلِئُ الشَّبَابِ [i. e. a youth full of the<br>\
sap, or vigour, of youthfulness]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
A buck-gazelle. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  عَبْعَبُ التَّصْوِيرِ means<br>\
Bulky in form, big (جَلِيل) in speech. (TA.<br>\
[But the addition “ big in speech ” is app. a<br>\
mistake, occasioned by an omission or a transposition: see عَبْعَابٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  See also another meaning voce عَبْعَابٌ. ―<br>\
-b6-  And العَبْعَبُ, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
not a mistranscription for الغبغب, (O,) but<br>\
sometimes pronounced with غ, (TA,) is the name<br>\
of A certain idol, (O, K, TA,) belonging to<br>\
Kudá&#39;ah (O, TA) and those dwelling near to<br>\
them. (TA.) And The place of the idol [app. of<br>\
the idol above mentioned] (K, TA) is also sometimes thus called. (TA.) See also الغَبْغَبُ.<br>\
-A2-<br>\

عَبْعَابٌ A tall man; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ عَبْعَبٌ.<br>\
(O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A man having an ample throat<br>\
and chest. (O, K.) One says رَجُلٌ عَبْعَابٌ قَبْقَابٌ<br>\
A man having an ample throat and chest, big<br>\
(جَلِيل) in speech. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A youth, or<br>\
or young man, (TA,) or an ass, (O, [in which<br>\
this application is confirmed by the citation of a<br>\
verse wherein the epithet is evidently applied to<br>\
a swift beast such as the wild ass,]) full-grown,<br>\
and goodly in make. (O, K, TA.)<br>\
عُنْبَبٌ Abundance of water. (IAar, O, K.<br>\
[See also عُبَابٌ.]) The ن is said by AM [and in<br>\
the O] to be augmentative. (TA.) [But it is<br>\

(A, * TA) meaning “ the vehemence of the running of water,” and therefore tropical, (TA,) (tropical:)  A<br>\
horse that runs much (S, O, TA, and Har ubi<br>\
suprà) and vehemently: (TA:) or a horse that<br>\

(K, TA:) or a courser easy in his running: or<br>\
that takes long, or wide, steps, (K,) in running,<br>\
or that runs far. (K accord. to different copies.)<br>\
[Golius, who writes the word يُعْبُوبٌ, gives<br>\
among its significations that of A locust that<br>\
leaps far or rapidly, as from the K; in a copy of<br>\
which he probably found جَرَاد written by mistake<br>\
for جَرَاد.] ―<br>\
