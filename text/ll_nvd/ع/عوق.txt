a thing]; (S, O, TA;) and عَنِ الوَجْهِ الَّذِى أَرَادَهُ<br>\
[from the course that he desired to pursue]. (TA.)<br>\
[Accord. to the S and O and K, the first is syn.<br>\
with حَبَسَهُ and صَرَفَهُ, and so is the last accord. to<br>\

cleave, or stick, to the heart of her husband;<br>\
(S, O, K, TA;) to which IKtt adds, and did not<br>\
hinder him from separating himself from her, or<br>\
marrying another: and some say that it means<br>\
she was not happy with her husband; near to his<br>\
heart; in favour with him, or beloved by him:<br>\
and some, that عَاقَتْ is an imitative adjunct to<br>\
لَاقَتْ, because the latter signifies لَصِقَتْ. (TA.)<br>\

عَوْقٌ [an inf. n.: and also used as an epithet,<br>\
signifying] One who hinders, prevents, impedes,<br>\
&amp;c., [see 1,] people from that which is good; as<br>\
also ↓ عَوْقَةٌ [but app. in an intensive sense]. (K.<br>\
[See also عُوَقٌ.]) ―<br>\

―<br>\

عَوِقٌ: see عُوَقٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and عَائِقٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Hungry: [a meaning indicated, but not expressed, in<br>\
the O and K:] you say رَجُلٌ عَوِقٌ لَوِقٌ [A very<br>\
hungry man]; (IAar, O, K;) لَوقٌ being an imitative [and corroborative] sequent. (TA in art.<br>\
لوق.)<br>\
عُوَقٌ and ↓ عُوَقَةٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ عِوَقٌ, (K,)<br>\
which last is from IAar, and is by some written<br>\
↓ عَوِقٌ, (TA,) and ↓ عَيِّقٌ and ↓ عَيِّقٌ, this last with<br>\
fet-h, (K,) i. e. with fet-h and teshdeed to the ى,<br>\
(TA, [but in the CK عَيْقٌ,]) A man having the<br>\
quality of hindering, preventing, impeding, retarding, or diverting by otherwise occupying, (S,<br>\
O, K, TA,) men from that which is good, and<br>\
his companions, because accidents diverting him<br>\
from his course prevent his attaining the object<br>\
of his want: (TA: [see also عَوْقٌ:]) and (O, K)<br>\
IDrd says, (O,) ↓ عُوَّقٌ, (O, K,) thus with tesh-deed accord. to El-Arzenee and Aboo-Sahl ElHarawee, applied to a man, (O,) signifies one<br>\
who hinders, prevents, impedes, &amp;c., men from<br>\
[accomplishing] their affairs: (O, K:) or it signifies, (K,) or signifies also, accord. to IDrd, (O,)<br>\
a coward, or cowardly; (O, K;) in this sense<br>\
peculiar to the dial. of Hudheyl; (O;) and so<br>\
عُوَقٌ: and عُوَقٌ is also syn. with ↓ عَائِقٌ: (K:)<br>\
thus it means accord. to Aboo-Usámeh, as an<br>\
epithet applied to a man: (O:) and ↓ عُوَّقٌ (O,<br>\
K) accord. to him (O) is pl. of ↓ عَائِقٌ: (O, K:)<br>\
and عُوَقٌ and ↓ عُوَّقٌ both signify also one whom<br>\
affairs cease not to hinder, prevent, impede, &amp;c.,<br>\
from [accomplishing] the object of his want: and<br>\
one who, when he purposes a thing, does it: (K:)<br>\
thus they are expl. by Ibn-&#39;Abbád; as though<br>\
having two contr. significations. (O.)<br>\
عِوَقٌ: see عُوَقٌ, first signification.<br>\
عَوْقَةٌ: see عَوْقٌ.<br>\
عُوَقَةٌ: see عُوَقٌ, first signification.<br>\
عُوَاقٌ A sound that issues from the belly of a<br>\
beast, or horse or the like, when he is going along;<br>\
(O, K;) as also وُعَاقٌ: (O:) and some say, a<br>\
sound of anything. (TA.)<br>\
عَوِيقٌ The sound of the sheath of the penis of<br>\
the horse; as also وَعِيقٌ. (TA.)<br>\
عَائِقٌ and ↓ عَوْقٌ and ↓ عُوقٌ and ↓ عَوِقٌ all signify the same; (K, TA;) i. e. [A person, or<br>\
thing,] hindering, preventing, impeding, withholding, turning back or away, retarding, or diverting<br>\
by occupying otherwise: (TA:) see also عُوَقٌ, in<br>\
two places: the pl. of the first is عُوَّقٌ. (O, K.)<br>\
One says, عَاقَنِى عَائِقٌ (K, TA) and عَقَانِى عَاقٍ<br>\
(TA) [A hinderer or hindrance, or an impeder or<br>\
impediment, &amp;c., hindered me, or impeded me,<br>\
&amp;c.,] عَنِ الأَمْرِ الَّذِى أَرَدْتُ [from the thing that I<br>\
desired to do]. (TA.) And عَوَائِقُ الدَّهْرِ signifies<br>\
The accidents, or casualties, of time or fortune,<br>\
that divert [or hinder or impede] by busying or<br>\
occupying or employing: (S, O, K, TA:) the<br>\
former noun being pl. of عَائِقَةٌ, or anomalously of<br>\
↓ عَوْقٌ. (TA.)<br>\
عُوَّقٌ: see عُوَقٌ, in three places.<br>\
عَيِّقٌ and عَيَّقٌ: see عُوَقٌ, first signification. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
It is also used as an imitative sequent: one says<br>\
ضَيِّقٌ لَيِّقٌ عَيِّقٌ (K) or ضَيِّقٌ عَيِّقٌ لَيِّقٌ (IAar, TA)<br>\
[app. meaning Very niggardly]: or, as some say,<br>\
عَيِّقٌ signifies as expl. voce عُوَقٌ, and is not an<br>\
imitative sequent. (TA.)<br>\
العَيُّوقُ A red [?] bright star in, or on, the<br>\
right [?] edge of the Milky Way, following, not<br>\
preceding, الثُّرَيَّا [the Pleiades]; rising before<br>\
الجَوْزَآء [by which may be meant either Orion or<br>\
Gemini]: (TA:) when it has risen, it is known<br>\
that الثُّرَيَّا has risen: (O:) [it is the well-known<br>\
name of the star Capella, notwithstanding its<br>\
being described above as “ red,” and as in, or<br>\
on, the “ right ” of the Milky Way; for Capella,<br>\
though not now red, has been observed to alter<br>\
in brightness by astronomers in very recent times;<br>\
and I think that the word rendered above “ right,”<br>\
which is أَيْمَن, is probably a mistranscription for<br>\
أَيْسَر, i. e. “ left: ” the description here following<br>\
plainly indicates Capella:] it is the bright star [a]<br>\
upon the left shoulder of Auriga: that upon the<br>\
left elbow is العَنْزُ: the two on the left wrist<br>\
together with العيّوق are called العِنَازُ: [see عَنْزٌ:]<br>\
it is also called the رَقِيب [or watcher] of الثُّرَيَّا,<br>\
because it rises therewith at many places: and<br>\
the star on the right shoulder [i. e.<br>\
β] with the<br>\
two upon the ankle-joints [which may be<br>\
θ and<br>\
ι,<br>\
for the constellation, is variously figured,] are<br>\
called تَوابِعُ العَيُّوقِ: (Kzw:) it is [said to be]<br>\
called العيّوق because of its [being regarded as]<br>\
impeding الدَّبَرَان from meeting الثُّرَيَّا: (TA:)<br>\
عَيُّوق, (Lth, Az, S, O,) is originally عَيْوُوق, (S, O,)<br>\
its medial radical being و; or it may be ى. (Lth,<br>\
Az, TA.) One says also, هٰذَا عَيُّوقُ طَالِعًا [meaning This is العَيُّوقُ rising]; suppressing the ال,<br>\
but meaning it to be understood, and therefore<br>\
leaving the word itself in its former determinate<br>\
state [without tenween]. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
مُعْوِقٌ One who is disappointed of attaining his<br>\
object [by the failing of his beast or of his<br>\
travelling-provision: see أَعْوَقَ]; syn. مُخْفِقٌ.<br>\
(Ibn-&#39; Abbád, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Hungry. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
يَعُوقُ A certain idol which pertained to the<br>\
people of Noah: (S, O, K:) or originally a certain righteous man in his age, of whom and of<br>\
seven other righteous men after him, by the direction of the Devil, were made images, which in<br>\
process of time became objects of worship: (Lth,<br>\
O, K:) or a certain idol which pertained to [the<br>\
tribe of] Kináneh, (Zj, TA,) or to Murád. (Ksh<br>\
and Bd in lxxi. 23.) [See also وَدٌّ.]<br>\
