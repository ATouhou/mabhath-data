عَثُرَ (S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
عَثِرَ;<br>\
(A, Msb, K;) and عَثِرَ, aor.<br>\
عَثَرَ; and عَثُرَ, aor.<br>\
عَثُرَ;<br>\
(A, K;) inf. n. عِثَارٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K) and<br>\
عَثْرٌ and عَثِيرٌ; (K;) said of a man and of a horse,<br>\
(S, Msb,) He stumbled, or tripped; [the most<br>\
usual meaning;] or he fell upon his face; syn.<br>\
كَبَا [which has both of these meanings]; as also<br>\
↓ تعثّر: (A, K:) or [simply] he fell; syn. سَقَطَ:<br>\
(Mgh:) or one says of a man, (Msb on the<br>\
authority of the Mukhtasar el-&#39;Eyn, and TA on<br>\
the authority of the T,) عَثَرَ, (Msb, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
عُثُورٌ, (Msb,) or عَثْرَةٌ; (TA; [perhaps a mistranscription for عَثْرٌ;]) and of a horse, عَثَرَ, inf. n.<br>\
عِثَارٌ; (Msb, TA;) فِعَالٌ being a measure of<br>\
inf. ns. of verbs signifying various faults of<br>\
horses and the like. (TA.) You say, عَثَرَ فِى ثَوْبِهِ<br>\
[He stumbled, or tripped, upon his garment].<br>\
(S, O, Msb.) And فِى أَذْيَالِهِ ↓ خَرَجَ يَتَعَثَّرُ [He<br>\
went forth stumbling, or tripping, upon his skirts].<br>\
(A.) And عَثَرَ بِهِ فَرَسُهُ فَسَقَطَ [His horse stumbled,<br>\
or tripped, with him, and he fell]. (S, O.) And<br>\
it is said in a prov., الجَوَادُ قَدْ يَعْثُرُ [The swift<br>\
and excellent horse sometimes stumbles, or trips]:<br>\
applied to a person by whom a slip that is not of<br>\
his nature is seen to have been committed. (O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] عَثَرَ فِى كَلَامِهِ and ↓ تعثّر (tropical:)  [He<br>\
stumbled, or tripped, in his speech]. (A.) And<br>\
لِسَانُهُ ↓ تعثّر (tropical:)  His tongue halted, faltered, or<br>\
hesitated. (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence, app.,]<br>\
عَثَرَ, (Kr, K, TA,) inf. n. عَثْرٌ, (Kr, O, TA,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He lied. (Kr, O, K, TA.) One says, فُلَانٌ<br>\
فِى العَثْرِ وَالبَائِنِ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one is occupied] in truth and falsehood [or rather in falsehood and truth]. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And عَثَرَ عَلَيْهِ,<br>\

latter erroneously written in the CK عَثُور,])<br>\
(tropical:)  [He stumbled on it; lighted on it by chance;]<br>\
he got, or obtained, knowledge of it; or sight and<br>\
knowledge of it; became acquainted with it; knew<br>\
it; or saw it; (S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K, * TA;)<br>\
accidentally, or without seeking; (TA;) [and so<br>\
عَثَرَ بِهِ; (see an ex. voce أَشْرَسُ;)] and ↓ أَعْثَرَ<br>\
signifies the same; but accord. to the usage of<br>\
the Kur-án, you say أَعْثَرْتُ غَيْرِى: so in the<br>\
Kitáb el-Abniyeh of IKtt. (TA. [See 4.])<br>\
You say, عَثَرَ عَلَى سِرِّ الرَّجُلِ (tropical:)  He obtained knowledge of, or became acquainted with, the secret<br>\
of the man [accidentally]. (TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
فَإِنْ عُثِرَ عَلَى أَنَّهُمَا اسْتَحَقَّا إِثْمًا, in the Kur<br>\
[v. 106], means (tropical:)  But if it become known, or<br>\
seen, (Ksh, Mgh, O, Bd, Jel,) that they two<br>\
have done what has necessitated sin, (Ksh, Bd,<br>\
Jel,) and deserved its being said of them that they<br>\
were sinners. (Ksh.) And عَثَرَ, aor.<br>\
عَثُرَ, inf. n. عُثُورٌ,<br>\
as expl. by Lth, means (assumed tropical:)  He (a man) entered<br>\
suddenly, or unexpectedly, upon an affair upon<br>\
which another had not so entered. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
عَثَرَ جَدُّهُ, (K, TA,) aor.<br>\
عَثُرَ and<br>\
عَثِرَ, (TA,) means<br>\
(tropical:)  His fortune, or good fortune, fell; syn. تَعِسَ;<br>\
(K, TA;) as being likened to one who has<br>\
stumbled, or tripped, or fallen upon his face.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\

TA,) The vein pulsed. (Lh, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  عَثَرَ بِهِ:<br>\
see 4. ―<br>\
-b8-  [Hence,] عَثَرَ بِهِمْ الزَّمَانُ (tropical:)  Time, or<br>\
fortune, destroyed them: (TA:) or caused them<br>\
to be overcome. (O.)<br>\
2<br>\
عَثَّرَ see the next paragraph, in three places.<br>\
4<br>\
اعثرهُ He caused him to stumble, or trip; or<br>\
to fall upon his face; [or simply, to fall;] as<br>\
also ↓ عثّرهُ; (K, TA;) [and so بِهِ ↓ عَثَرَ; (see 1,<br>\
last sentence, and see also عَاثُورٌ, first sentence;)]<br>\
said of God. (TA.) IAar cites as an ex.,<br>\
فَخَرَجْتُ أُعْثَرُ فِى مَقَادِمِ جُبَّتِى<br>\
لَوْلَا الحَيَآءُ أَطَرْتُهُ إِحْضَارَا<br>\
[And I went forth, made to stumble, or trip, upon<br>\
the fore parts of my jubbeh: but for the sense of<br>\
shame, I had made it to fly, in running]: accord.<br>\
to one relation, however, the verb in question,<br>\
in this verse, is أَعْثُرُ. (TA.) And اعثرهُ اللّٰهُ is<br>\
syn. with أَتْعَسَهُ [of which see various explanations in art. تعس]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اعثر بِهِ<br>\
عِنْدَ السُّلْطَانِ, (K,) or عِنْدَهُ ↓ عثّرهُ, (A,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
impugned his character to the Sultán, (A, O, K,)<br>\
and sought to make him fall into destruction by<br>\
means of the latter. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And اعثرهُ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [He made him to stumble upon it, or to light on<br>\
it by chance; or] he made him to get, or obtain,<br>\
knowledge of it, or sight and knowledge of it; to<br>\
become acquainted with it; to know it; or to see<br>\
it; (S, A, O, Msb, K; *) accidentally, or without<br>\
seeking. (B, TA.) Hence the phrase in the<br>\
Kur [xviii. 20] أَعْثَرْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ; (S, Ta;) in which<br>\
غَيْرَهُمْ, the objective complement, is suppressed.<br>\
(TA.) And اعثرهُ عَلَى أَصْحَابِهِ (tropical:)  He guided him,<br>\
or showed him the way, to his companions. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  اعثر جَدَّهُ, and ↓ عثّرهُ, (assumed tropical:)  He [i. e. God] made<br>\
his fortune, or good fortune, to fall. (K. [See<br>\
عَثَرَ جَدُّهُ.])<br>\

Q. Q. 1<br>\
عَثْيَرَ القَوْمُ [from عِثْيَرٌ] The people, or<br>\
party, raised the dust, or earth, or bits of dry<br>\
clay or compact earth, (termed عِثْيَر,) with the<br>\
extremities of their toes, in walking. (Kh, Har<br>\
p. 488.)<br>\
-A2-  عَيْثَرَ الطَّيْرَ [from عَيْثَرٌ] He saw, or<br>\
beheld, the birds: or he saw that the birds ran:<br>\
(O:) or he saw the birds running, and augured<br>\
from them (فَزَجَرَهَا). (K. [But this addition,<br>\
فزجرها, is evidently taken from an explanation of<br>\
the words here following.]) A poet says,<br>\
لَقَدْ عَيْثَرْتَ طَيْرَكَ لَوْ تَعِيفُ<br>\
[i. e. Thou sawest, or beheldest, thy birds; &amp;c.:<br>\
would that thou wouldst augur from them, and<br>\
take warning]. (O.) And you say, عَيْثَرْتُ الشَّىْءَ<br>\
I saw, or beheld, the thing; (L, TA;) and individuated it. (TA.)<br>\
عَثْرٌ: see عَثَرِىٌّ.<br>\
عُثْرٌ A lie; or falsehood; (K;) as also ↓ عَثَرٌ.<br>\
(IAar, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The Eagle: (K:) a meaning<br>\
also assigned in the K, in art. عبر, but erroneously, to عُبْرٌ. (TA.)<br>\
عَثَرٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
عَثْرَةٌ A stumble, or trip, (Msb, TA,) in walking, or going along: pl. عَثَرَاتٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[hence,] (tropical:)  A slip, lapse, fault, wrong action, or<br>\
mistake; (S, O, Msb, TA;) so called as being<br>\
a fall into sin or crime. (Msb.) One says,<br>\
أَقَالَ اللّٰهُ عَثْرَتَكَ (tropical:)  [May God cancel thy slip,<br>\
lapse, fault, &amp;c.]. (A.) And it is said in a trad.,<br>\
لَا حَلِيمَ إِلَّا ذُو عَثْرَةٍ i. e. (tropical:)  There is no one to be<br>\
characterized as of a forbearing disposition except<br>\
he be one who has committed a slip, and becomes<br>\
admonished thereby, distinguishing the occasions<br>\
of error so as to avoid them [and to make<br>\
allowance for others who have done the like].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (assumed tropical:)  War, or fight, against unbelievers or others; because war, or fight, is an<br>\
occasion of frequent stumbling, or tripping: so<br>\
in a trad., in which it is said, لَا تَبْدَأْهُمْ بِالعَثْرَةِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Begin not ye with them by war]; meaning<br>\
invite ye them first to El-Islám or to the payment<br>\
of the poll-tax; and if they assent not, then have<br>\
recourse to war. (TA.)<br>\
عَثِرَةٌ Land (أَرْض) without herbage, being high,<br>\
and overspread with عِثْيَر, i. e. dust: (O, TA:)<br>\
and said to occur in a trad. as the name of a<br>\
particular land. (O, K, * TA.)<br>\
عَثَرِىٌّ i. q. عِذْىٌ, (Az, S, O, Msb, TA,) as some<br>\
say; (Msb;) i. e., (Az, S, O, TA,) Such as is<br>\
watered by the rain (Az, S, K, TA) alone, (S,)<br>\
of palm-trees, (Az, O, TA,) or of seed-produce:<br>\
(S:) or such as is watered by water running upon<br>\
the surface of the ground, (O, Msb,) of palmtrees: (Msb:) or seed-produce that is watered<br>\
by torrents and by rain, the water being made to<br>\
flow thereto in channels: (TA:) and ↓ عَثْرٌ<br>\
signifies the same: (K, TA:) or, accord. to<br>\
IAth, palm-trees (نَخِيل) that imbibe with their<br>\
roots of the rain-water that collects in a part<br>\
hollowed out in the ground: (TA:) the former<br>\
term is said to be thus applied because what is so<br>\
called is as though it stumbled upon water without<br>\
any labour of its owner; regarding it as an<br>\
irregular rel. n. from العَثْرُ: (O, * TA:) but Abu-l-&#39;Abbás [i. e. Th] says that, thus applied, it is<br>\
with teshdeed to the ث [i. e. عَثَّرِىٌّ], though not<br>\
in the sense here following. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  A<br>\
man who does not occupy himself in seeking the<br>\
things of the present world nor those of the world<br>\
to come: (O, K, TA:) occurring in a trad., in<br>\
which such is said to be the most hateful of mankind to God: (O, TA:) in this sense, sometimes<br>\
written with teshdeed to the ث, (K, TA,) and<br>\
thus it is accord. to Sh (O, TA) and IAar;<br>\
(TA;) but correctly without teshdeed: (Th, K,<br>\
TA:) and said by some to be from عَثَرِىٌّ<br>\
applied to palm-trees. (O, * TA.) One says<br>\
also, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ عَثَرِيًّا, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one came<br>\
unoccupied. (O, TA.)<br>\
عَثَارٌ or عِثَارٌ: see عَاثُورٌ, in six places:<br>\
-A2-  and<br>\
for عِثَارٌ see also عِثْيَرٌ.<br>\
عَثُورٌ [Having a habit of stumbling or tripping,<br>\
or of falling:] that stumbles, or trips, and falls,<br>\
much or often. (Har p. 296.)<br>\
عِثْيَرٌ, (S, O, K,) not عَثْيَرٌ, for there is not in the<br>\
language any word of the measure فَعْيَلٌ, with<br>\
fet-h to the ف, except ضَهْيَدٌ, meaning “ hardy,<br>\
strong, or robust,” and this is [said to be] forged,<br>\
(S, O, [but see ضهيد,]) Dust, (MA, O, K,) syn.<br>\
غُبَارٌ, (O,) or عَجَاجٌ, and تُرَابٌ, (K,) and thus<br>\
↓ عِثْيَرَاتٌ is expl. by Sb; (TA;) or dust rising<br>\
or spreading; (S, MA; *) as also ↓ عِثْيَرَةٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and ↓ عِثَارٌ signifies the same. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
Clay, or earth, (K, TA,) or dust, or bits of clay<br>\
or compact earth, (TA,) which one turns over<br>\
(K, TA) with the extremities of the feet (K) or of<br>\
the toes, in walking, or going along, no other<br>\
mark of the foot being seen: (TA:) and an<br>\
obscure trace or mark, (K, TA,) said to be more<br>\
obscure than such as is termed أَثَرٌ: (TA:) and so<br>\
↓ عَيْثَرٌ, with the ى put before [the ث] and with<br>\
fet-h to the ع in both [of these senses: misunderstood by SM as meaning “ and with fet-h to the<br>\
ع in both words,” i. e. in عثير and عيثر]: (K:)<br>\
or ↓ عَيْثَرٌ signifies an obscure trace or mark:<br>\
(S:) and Yaakoob mentions the saying مَا رَأَيْتُ<br>\
↓ لَهُ أَثَرًا وَلَا عَيْثَرًا and وَلَا عِثْيَرًا [app. meaning I<br>\
saw not any trace of him nor any obscure trace]:<br>\
(S, O:) or ولا عِثْيَرًا means, nor clay, or earth,<br>\
&amp;c., turned over by the extremities of his feet:<br>\
(TA:) and it is said that ↓ ولا عَيْثَرًا means, nor<br>\
bodily form. (O.) And [it is said that] مَا لَهُ أَثَرٌ<br>\
وَلَا عِثْيَرٌ and ↓ ولا عَيْثَرٌ means He is not known to<br>\
be a pedestrian by the appearing of his foot-mark,<br>\
nor to be a horseman by his horse&#39;s raising the<br>\
dust. (TA.) [See also Har p. 488.]<br>\
عِثْيَرَةٌ, and its pl. عِثْيَرَاتٌ: see عِثْيَرٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  One<br>\
says also أَرْضٌ عِثْيَرَةٌ, meaning A land in which is<br>\
much dust. (TA.)<br>\
عَاثِرٌ [Stumbling, or tripping; &amp;c. ―<br>\
-b2-  And] (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
liar. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And one says also جَدٌّ عَاثِرٌ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Fortune, or good fortune, in a falling state:<br>\
(see 1, near the end:)] pl. عَوَاثِرُ: (TA:) ―<br>\
-b4-  or<br>\
this may be pl of عَاثِرٌ signifying The snare of a<br>\
sportsman: ―<br>\
-b5-  or it may be pl. of ↓ عَاثِرَةٌ signifying (assumed tropical:)  An accident that destroys, or causes to be<br>\
overcome, him whom it befalls: (O:) ―<br>\
-b6-  or it<br>\
may be pl. of عَاثُورٌ [q. v.], the ى being suppressed,<br>\
(O, TA,) by poetic license, in a verse in which<br>\
it occurs. (TA.)<br>\
عَيْثَرٌ The substance of a thing; its bodily, or<br>\
corporeal, form; syn. عَيْنٌ and شَخْصٌ. (T, O,<br>\
L, K, TA. [In this sense, it is said in the TA<br>\
to be erroneously written in all the copies of the<br>\
K عَثْيَر, with the ث before the ى; but I find it<br>\
written عَيْثَر in my MS. copy of the K and also<br>\
in the CK.]) See also عِثْيَرٌ, in five places.<br>\
عَاثِرَةٌ: see عَاثِرٌ.<br>\
عَاثُورٌ A pit dug for a lion or other [animal],<br>\
(S, A, O,) that he may fall into it, (A,) in<br>\
order that he may be taken: (S, O:) this is the<br>\
primary signification: (A:) or a thing that is<br>\
prepared for one to fall into it: (K:) or, as also<br>\
عثار [i. e. ↓ عَثَارٌ or ↓ عِثَارٌ (see what follows)], a<br>\
thing by which one is made to stumble and fall;<br>\
expl. by بِهِ ↓ مَا عُثِرَ: (TA:) the pl. is عَوَاثِيرُ;<br>\
whence, perhaps, عَوَاثِرُ, by suppression of the ى.<br>\
(O, TA. [See عَاثرٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  A place of<br>\
perdition: (TA voce حَاجُورٌ:) or (tropical:)  a cause, or<br>\
place, of perdition or of death: (A, K:) applied<br>\
to a land. (K.) You say, وَقَعَ فِى عَاثُورٍ (tropical:)  He<br>\
fell into a cause, or place, of perdition or of<br>\
death. (A, TA.) And فُلَانٌ يَقِى صَاحِبَهُ العَوَاثِرَ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Such a one preserves his companion from the<br>\
causes, or places, of perdition or of death]. (A.)<br>\
And it is said in a trad., إِنَّ قُرَيْشًا أَهْلُ أَمَانَةٍ مَنْ<br>\
بَغَاهَا العَوَاثِيرَ كَبَّهُ اللّٰهُ لِمَنْخِرَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  [Verily the tribe<br>\
of Kureysh are people of fidelity: whoso seeks for<br>\
them the causes, or places, of perdition or of<br>\
death, may God lay him prostrate upon his<br>\
nostrils]: or, accord. to one relation, عَوَاثِرَ. (O,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,] (tropical:)  Difficulty, or distress;<br>\
as also عَاثُورُ شَرٍّ: (S, O:) and evil; (K, TA;)<br>\
like عَاذُورٌ, which is a dial. var. thereof, or an<br>\
instance of mispronunciation; (S and O in art.<br>\
عذر;) as also ↓ عَثَارٌ, (accord. to some copies of<br>\
the K,) or ↓ عِثَارٌ: (thus in other copies of the K<br>\
and in the TA [in the latter of which it is said to<br>\
be with kesr; and this I think to be the more<br>\
probably correct; originally an inf. n.]:) and<br>\
شَرٍّ ↓ عِثَارُ is said by Fr to signify the same as<br>\
عَاثُورُ شَرٍّ. (TA.) You say, لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ عَاثُورًا,<br>\
(As, S, O, TA,) and ↓ عِثَارًا, (TA,) (tropical:)  I experienced from him, or it, difficulty, or distress. (As,<br>\
S, O, TA.) And وَقَعُوا فِى عَاثُورِ شَرٍّ, (As, S, O,<br>\
TA,) and عَافُورِ شَرٍّ, (S, O,) (tropical:)  They fell into difficulty, or distress: (As, S, O:) or into a confusion of evil and difficulty or distress. (TA.)<br>\
It is the opinion of Yaakoob that the ف in عَافُور<br>\
is a substitute for the ث in عَاثُور: but Az<br>\
observes that this is not necessarily the case, as<br>\
the meaning of difficulty is implied in the root<br>\
عفر. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It is said to signify also A kind<br>\
of snare (مِصْيَدَة) made of bark. (O.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And A<br>\
channel that is dug for the purpose of irrigating<br>\
thereby a palm-tree such as is termed بَعْلٌ. (O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And A well. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  And it may also be<br>\
used as an epithet [app. meaning Perilous, or destructive]. (ISd, TA.)<br>\
