عَجِسَ,] inf. n. عَجْسٌ, (S,<br>\
O,) He grasped it; (S, O, K;) namely, a thing<br>\
[such, for ex., as a bow]: (S:) [and he grasped<br>\
it hard; for] عَجْسٌ signifies also the grasping a<br>\
thing hard. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَجَسَهُ عَنْ حَاجَتِهِ,<br>\
aor. as above, (O, K,) and so the inf. n., (O,)<br>\
He, or it, withheld him from the object of his<br>\
want; (O, K;) as also ↓ تعجّسهُ: (TA:) and<br>\
↓ تعجّسهُ is likewise said of a radical, or hereditary, evil quality, meaning It withheld him from<br>\
generous actions; (Sh, O, K;) as also تعقّلهُ and<br>\
تثفّلهُ. (Sh, O.) And عَجَسَنِى عَنْكَ It (an affair,<br>\
or event,) withheld me from thee. (AO, O.)<br>\
And بِهِمْ ↓ تعجّس He withheld them; and he<br>\

(Sh, O, K: *) and one says, بِىَ الرَّاحِلَةُ ↓ تَعَجَّسَتْ<br>\
The riding-camel kept me back, or made me slow<br>\
or tardy. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  عَجَسَ and ↓ تعجّس alone<br>\
signify He was, or became, slow, tardy, late, or<br>\
backward: (TA:) and the latter signifies [likewise] he was, or became, behind, or backward;<br>\
or he remained behind, or held back. (O, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And one says of a she-camel, عَجَسَتْ بِهِ, (O,<br>\
K,) aor. as above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (TA,)<br>\
meaning She turned aside, or away, with him<br>\
from the road, by reason of her briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness; (O, K, TA;) and so<br>\
↓ تعجّست; and, as written by El-Urmawee,<br>\

عَجَّسَ see what next precedes.<br>\
5<br>\
تَعَجَّسَ see 1, in six places. ―<br>\
-b2-  تعجّسهُ also signifies<br>\
He reckoned, or esteemed, his judgment, or<br>\
opinion, weak. (Sh, O, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He upbraided him, or reproached him, for a thing, or<br>\
an affair, (IDrd, K, TA,) which he had commanded him to do. (IDrd, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And تعجّس<br>\
أَمْرَهُ He searched repeatedly after the knowledge<br>\
of his (i. e. another&#39;s S, O) affair, or case. (S,<br>\
O, K.) Hence, in a trad., فَيَتَجَّسُكُمْ فِى قُرَيْشٍ<br>\
And he seeks repeatedly after you among Kureysh.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And تعجّست الأَرْضَ غُيُوثٌ Rains fell,<br>\
one after another, upon the earth, or land, (S, O,<br>\
K, TA,) and bore heavily upon it. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
تعجّس الرَّجُلُ The man went forth in a last<br>\
portion, before daybreak, (↓ بِعِجْسَةٍ, O, or<br>\
↓ بِعُجْسَةٍ, K, [but see what follows,]) of the<br>\
night: (O, K:) El-Marrár Ibn-Sa&#39;eed El-Fak&#39;asee<br>\
says, describing his travelling-companions,<br>\
وَإِذَا هُمُ ارْتَحَلُوا بِلَيْلٍ حَابِسٍ<br>\
↓ المُتَعَجِّسِ ↓ أُخْرَى النُّجُومِ بِعَجْسَةِ<br>\
[And when they departed in an impeding night,<br>\
in the last period of the appearance of the stars,<br>\
in a last portion of the night of him who goes<br>\
forth at that time]. (O: in which بعجسة is thus<br>\
written, with fet-h and damm, and with مَعًا<br>\
above them.) [It is also said in the O (immediately after this verse), and likewise in the K and<br>\
TA (in neither of which is the verse cited), in all<br>\
of them probably from one and the same source,<br>\
that ↓ المُتَعَجِّسُ means المُتَشَمْخِرُ; and it is<br>\
added in the TA that this has been mentioned in<br>\
its place: but it is not mentioned in its proper<br>\
art. in the O nor in the K nor in the TA; and<br>\
it is evidently a mistranscription, for المُسْتَحِرُ,<br>\
part. n. of اِسْتَحَرَ (q. v. voce أَسْحَرَ), and therefore I have rendered المُتَعَجِّس as above.]<br>\
عَجْسٌ and ↓ عُجْسٌ and ↓ عِجْسٌ The handle,<br>\
or part that is grasped by the hand, of a bow;<br>\
(S, O, K, TA;) which is the part, thereof, that<br>\

thickest place therein; (TA;) as also ↓ مَعْجِسٌ<br>\
[lit. the place of grasping]. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And,<br>\
(K,) or the first of these words, (S, O,) A<br>\
portion of the middle of the night; (S, O, K;)<br>\
as though from the عَجْس of the bow; [whence]<br>\
one says, مَضَى عَجْسٌ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ [A portion of<br>\
the middle of the night passed]: (S, O:) or the<br>\
last part of the night: (Lth, O, K:) or the<br>\
blackness of the night &amp;c. (TA.) [See also<br>\
عُجْسَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And see أَعْجَسُ.<br>\
عُجْسٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\

(O.)<br>\
عَجِيسٌ, applied to a stallion, (S, K, TA,)<br>\
Impotent to cover; (TA;) that will not impregnate: (S, K, TA:) as also عَجِيزٌ. (S.) And<br>\
both signify also A man who does not come to<br>\
women [by reason of impotence]. (TA in art.<br>\
عجز.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also what next follows.<br>\
لَا آتِيكَ سَجِيسَ عُجَيْسٍ, (S, O,) and سَجِيسَ<br>\
↓ عَجِيسٍ and سَجِيسَ عَجِيسَ, (O,) both of which<br>\
words are written in the K in this art. like<br>\
أَمِير, with a reference to art. سجس, but the latter<br>\
of them is correctly عُجَيْس, in the dim. form,<br>\
(TA,) mean I will not come to thee ever; (S,<br>\
O;) or while time lasts. (TA.) And one says<br>\
also, لَا آتِيكَ عُجَيْسَ الدَّهْرِ I will not come to thee<br>\
to the end of time. (TA.)<br>\
