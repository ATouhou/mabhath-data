slavery: (S, Mgh, O, Msb, * K:) ↓ عَتَقَهُ in this<br>\

عِتَاقٌ has this meaning applied to camels, (TA,)<br>\

are the generous, or excellent, thereof; and so of<br>\
birds; (Mgh;) [the noble thereof, in a sense<br>\
wider that that in which this epithet is applied<br>\
in English falconry;] or of birds, such as prey;<br>\
(S, O, K, TA;) عَتِيقٌ being applied to one of<br>\
them: (TA:) عِتَاقُ الطَّيْرِ is also applied [particularly] to eagles: (IAar, TA voce عُقَابٌ:) and<br>\
عَتِيقُ الطَّيْرِ, to the hawk, or falcon: (O, TA:)<br>\
and عَتِيقٌ signifies anything generous, or excellent;<br>\
(S;) and anything choice, or best; (S, O, K;)<br>\
thus applied to a hawk, and dates, and water,<br>\
and fat: (S:) or العَتِيقُ means dates [themselves],<br>\

(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Beautiful, or comely: so in the<br>\
saying, فُلَانٌ عَتِيقُ الوَجْهِ [Such a one is beautiful,<br>\
or comely, in respect of the face]. (O, TA.)<br>\

K;) as also ↓ عَاتِقٌ, and ↓ مُعْتَقٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
and some of the relaters of traditions say ↓ مَعْتُوقٌ,<br>\
(TA,) but this is not allowable: (Msb, TA:)<br>\
عَتِيقَةٌ is applied to a female, (S, O, Msb, K,) and<br>\
عَتِيقٌ also: Msb:) the pl. of عَتِيقٌ is عُتَقَآءُ, (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, K,) and عِتَاقٌ also sometimes<br>\
occurs, like كِرَامٌ as a pl. of كَرِيمٌ; (Msb;) and<br>\
the pl. of عَتِيقَةٌ is عَتَائِقُ. (S, O, Msb.) العَتِيقُ is<br>\
an appellation applied to Es-Siddeek, (S, K,) i. e.<br>\
(S) to Aboo-Bekr, (S, O, K,) as a surname, (K,)<br>\
because he was said by the Prophet to be freed<br>\
(عَتِيق) from the fire [of Hell]: or because of his<br>\
beauty, or comeliness: (S, O, K:) or he was so<br>\
named by his mother. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And Old; (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, L, Msb, K;) as also ↓ عَاتِقٌ: (S, O:)<br>\
the former is applied in this sense to anything,<br>\
even to a man: (S, L:) and the pl. is عِتَاقٌ, which<br>\
occurs in a trad. applied to the earlier verses of<br>\
the Kur-án that were revealed at Mekkeh, (L,<br>\
TA,) and عُتْقٌ, (S, K, *) or عُتُقٌ, with two dammehs, (Mgh, Msb,) like بُرُدٌ pl. of بَرِيدٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
applied to دَرَاهِم, (Mgh, Msb,) عُتْقٌ being [probably] a contraction of عُتُقٌ (like as بُرْدٌ is of بُرُدٌ)<br>\
and in like manner applied to دَنَانِير, (S,) [and<br>\
عُتَّقٌ occurs in the TA in art. سم, agreeably with<br>\
general analogy if pl. of عَاتِقٌ,] but عُتُّقٌ, with two<br>\
dammehs and teshdeed, is a mistake. (Mgh.)<br>\
البَيْتُ العَتِيقُ is an appellation of The Kaabeh,<br>\
(S, O, K,) given to it in the Kur-án [xxii. 30 and<br>\
34, as meaning the Old House], (O,) because it<br>\
was the first house founded upon the earth, (O,<br>\
K,) as is said in the Kur [iii. 90]: (O:) or [as<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  the Freed House,] because it was freed<br>\
from submersion (O, K) in the days of the Deluge,<br>\
(O,) being taken up; (TA;) or from the imperious,<br>\
overbearing, or tyrannical, of mankind; or from<br>\
the Abyssinians; or because not possessed by any<br>\
one; (O, K;) and [thus expl.] it is tropical.<br>\
(TA.) You say قَنْطَرَةٌ عَتِيقَةٌ [An old bridge],<br>\
(S, O, K,) with ة, (S, O,) and قَنْطَرَةٌ جَدِيدٌ<br>\
[meaning the contr.], (S, O, K,) without ة, (S,<br>\
O,) because عَتِيقَةٌ has the meaning of the measure<br>\
فَاعِلَةٌ, (S, O, K,) but جَدِيدٌ has the meaning of<br>\
the measure مَفْعُولَةٌ. (S, O.) And رَاحٌ عَتِيقٌ, (O,<br>\
K,) without ة, (O,) and عَتِيقَةٌ and ↓ عَاتِقٌ [app.<br>\

has just attained to maturity: (Z, TA:) Hassán<br>\
says, [using it as an epithet in which the quality<br>\
of a subst. predominates,]<br>\
كَالْمِسْكَ تَخْلِطُهُ بِمَآءِ سَحَابَةٍ<br>\
أَوْ عَاتِقٍ كَدَمِ الذَّبِيحِ مُدَامِ<br>\
[Like musk which thou mixest with the water of a<br>\
cloud, or old wine (&amp;c.) like the blood of the<br>\
slaughtered animal, made to continue long in its<br>\
unopened jar]. (S, O, TA: but the last, for<br>\
تَخْلِطُهُ, has مُخْتَلِطٌ.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And العَتِيقُ signifies<br>\
Wine [itself]. (K.) And [What is termed]<br>\

(K, TA.) ―<br>\

(S, O, TA,) i. e. of that of which the first feathers<br>\
have fallen off and strong feathers have grown;<br>\
(TA;) when it has flown and become independent;<br>\
(K, TA;) thought by A&#39;Obeyd to be from the<br>\
meaning of “ outgoing,” or “ outstripping,” كَأَنَّهُ<br>\
يَعْتِقُ أَىْ يَسْبِقُ [as though it outwent, or outstripped]: (S, O, TA:) or of the young of the sandgrouse (القَطَا), or of the pigeon, while not yet firm,<br>\
or strong, (K, TA,) not advanced in age: (TA:)<br>\
pl., in this and the following senses, عَوَاتِقُ. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And A girl that has attained to the commencement of the state of puberty, (S, O, K,) and become<br>\
kept behind the curtain in the tent, or house, of<br>\

of childhood, and attained to being marriageable;<br>\
(O;) or because she has passed forth from the<br>\
state, or condition, of serving her father and<br>\
mother, and has not yet been possessed by a<br>\
husband; but AAF says that this is not valid:<br>\

service of her family: (TA:) or such as is between the stages of puberty and middle age: (K:)<br>\

the sword: (Ham p. 556:) it is [said to be]<br>\

(K;) but this is not of established authority: a<br>\
verse which is cited by IB [and in the O] as an<br>\
instance of its being fem. is asserted by some to<br>\
be forged: (TA:) the pl. is عَوَاتِقُ (Msb, K, and<br>\
Ham ubi suprà,) and عُتْقٌ. (K.) One says رَجُلٌ<br>\
أَمْيَلُ العَاتِقِ A man bent, or bending, [or sloping,]<br>\
