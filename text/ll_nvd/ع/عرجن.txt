عَرْجَنَهُ He struck him, or beat him, with<br>\
an عُرْجُون [q. v.]. (S, K.) And عَرْجَنَهُ بِالعَصَا<br>\
He struck him, or beat him, with the staff, or<br>\
stick. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He figured it (i. e. a garment, or piece of cloth,) with the forms of عَرَاجِين,<br>\
pl. of عُرْجُونٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He smeared, or<br>\
rubbed over, him, or it, with blood, or with<br>\
saffron, or with خِضَاب [i. e. hinnà, or the<br>\
like]. (K.)<br>\
عُرْجُونٌ A raceme of a palm-tree, or of dates;<br>\
syn. عِذْقٌ: or, when it has become dry and curved:<br>\
(K:) or the base, or lower part, (أَصْل, S, K, and<br>\
also A and Mgh and Msb in art. عرج [because<br>\
the ن is therein regarded as augmentative],) of<br>\
the عِذْق (S, K) or كِبَاسَة [which signifies the<br>\
same as عِذْق], (A, Mgh, Msb,) which curves,<br>\
and from which the fruit-stalks are cut off, and<br>\
which then remains upon the palm-tree, dry: (S:)<br>\
or the عُود [meaning main stem] of the كِبَاسَة:<br>\
(Th, K:) Az says, it is yellow and broad: [but<br>\
it is the contrary of broad in comparison with its<br>\
length:] and in the Kur xxxvi. 39, the moon<br>\
when it has become slender [in appearance, towards the end of the lunar month,] is likened to<br>\
the old عُرْجُون, in respect, as ISd says, of its<br>\
slenderness and curvature: (TA:) [in the TA<br>\
voce سُبَاطَةٌ, the pl. عَرَاجِينُ is strangely used as<br>\
meaning the fruit-stalks of the raceme of a palmtree:] بَنَاتُ عُرْجُونٍ signifies the fruit-stalks of a<br>\
raceme of dates: (T in art. بنى:) [it is said<br>\
that] the ن of عُرْجُونٌ, though this word imports<br>\
the meaning of اِنْعِرَاجٌ [or “ a state of bending ”],<br>\
is shown to be radical by the word مُعَرْجَنٌ, occurring in a verse of Ru-beh, and also by the fact that<br>\
there is no verb of the measure فَعْلَنَ. (TA. [But<br>\
عَشْرَنَ and سَبْعَنَ, though these are said to be<br>\
post-classical, and, accord. to some, عَلْوَنَ, may<br>\
be mentioned, and perhaps some other, as being<br>\
of this measure.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A certain plant, (K,<br>\
TA,) white, accord. to Th, (TA,) like the فُطْر [or<br>\
toadstool], resembling the فِقْع [a white and soft<br>\
sort of كَمْء], (K, TA,) which dries, having a<br>\
round form: or a species of the كَمْأَة, of the<br>\
measure of a span, or a little less than that;<br>\
good, or pleasant, while fresh: (TA:) pl.<br>\
عَرَاجِينُ. (K.)<br>\
مُعَرْجَنٌ, occurring in a verse of Ru-beh, (TA,)<br>\
A garment, or piece of cloth, in which are<br>\
[figured] the forms of عَرَاجِين [pl. of عُرْجُونٌ].<br>\
(A and TA in art. عرج.)<br>\
