[And we used, when an insolent tyrant of a people<br>\
desired to execute against us a plot, to carry him<br>\
upon the horn of an antelope of a whitish dustcolour, or white but not of a clear hue, &amp;c.];<br>\
meaning, we used to slay him, and to carry his<br>\
head upon the spear-head; for the spear-heads,<br>\
in time past, were of horns. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence<br>\
the saying رَمَانِى عَنْ قَرْنِ أَعْفَرَ i. q. رمانى بِدَاهِيَةٍ<br>\
(tropical:)  [He sent upon me a calamity; or he made a<br>\
very crafty man to be my assailant]: for the<br>\
same reason, also, قَرْنُ أَعْفَرَ is proverbially used<br>\
to signify (tropical:)  A difficulty, or distress, that befalls<br>\
one: and one says to a man who has passed the<br>\
night in disquieting distress, كُنْتَ عَلَى قَرْنِ أَعْفَرَ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Thou wast pierced by grief]. (TA.) One says<br>\
also, of him who is frightened and disquieted,<br>\
كَأَنَّهُ عَلَى قَرْنِ أَعْفَرَ [He is as though he were<br>\

The thirteenth night [of the lunar month]: (S,<br>\
O:) or the night of blackness: (A:) but accord.<br>\
to IAar, اللَّيَالِى العُفْرُ signifies the white nights;<br>\
(A;) and so says Th, without particularizing:<br>\
(TA:) or the nights thus called are the seventh<br>\
and eighth and ninth nights of the lunar month;<br>\
(K;) because of the whiteness of the moon [therein]. (TA.) It is said in a trad. لَيْسَ عُفْرُ اللَّيَالِى<br>\
كَالدَّآدِئِ The moon-lit nights are not like the<br>\
black nights: some say that this is a proverb.<br>\

be written مُعْفِرٌ; and perhaps it is thus in correct<br>\
copies of the A.]<br>\
مَعْفُورٌ: see عَافِرٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  أَرْضٌ مَعْفُورَةٌ Land of which<br>\

ثَوْبٌ مَعَافِرِىٌّ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,) pl. ثِيَابٌ<br>\
مَعَافِرِيَّةٌ, (S, O, K,) and بُرْدٌ مَعَافِرِىٌّ, (Az,) and<br>\
hence, simply, ↓ مَعَافِرُ, (Az, Mgh,) as a subst.,<br>\

بُرْد, (Az,) so called in relation to ↓ مَعَافِرُ, (S, O, K,<br>\
