عَفَا, aor. يَعْفُو, (S, Msb,) inf. n. عَفَآءٌ (S, Msb,<br>\
K) and عُفُوٌّ and عَفْوٌ, (Msb, K,) It was, or became,<br>\
effaced, erased, rased, or obliterated; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ تعفّى: (K:) and it, or he, perished, came<br>\
to nought or to an end, or died. (S, TA.) One<br>\
says, عَفَا الأَثَرُ The trace, vestige, or footprint, was,<br>\
or became, effaced, &amp;c. (TA.) And [hence,] عَفَا<br>\
أَثَرُهُ, inf. n. عَفَآءٌ, He perished, or died. (K.) And عَفَا<br>\
المَنْزِلُ, aor. as above. (S, Msb,) and so the inf. ns.<br>\
as in the first sentence, (Msb,) the place of alighting, or abode, was, or became effaced, &amp;c., (S,<br>\
Msb:) and عَفَت الدَّارُ. aor. تعْفُو, inf. a عَفَآءٌ and<br>\
عُفُوٌّ [and عَفْوٌ]: (TA;) and ↓ تَعَفَّت, (S, TA.) and<br>\
↓ عَفَّت also; (TA;) The house, or dwelling, or<br>\
abode, was, or became, effaced, &amp;c. (S, TA)<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd cites, as an ex. of العَفَآءُ signifying the<br>\
being, or becoming, effaced, &amp;c., and the perishing,<br>\
&amp;c., the saying of Zuheyr, (S, TA.) mentioning<br>\
a dwelling, or an abode, (TA.)<br>\
تَحَمَّلُ أَهُلَهَا عَنْهَا فَبَانُوا<br>\
عَلَى آثَارِ مَا ذَهَبَ العَفَآءُ<br>\
[Its occupants departed from it, and separated<br>\
themselves, or removed far away; may the state<br>\
of that which is effaced, &amp;c., be or rest, upon the<br>\
traces of what has gone away; or the meaning<br>\
may be, dust is upon the traces &amp;c., (see عَفَآءٌ as<br>\
a subst., below;) but it is not thus accord to<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd; for] he says, This is like their saying<br>\
عَلَيْهِ الدَّبَارُ as an imprecation against one expressing a prayer that he may go away and not return.<br>\
(S, TA.) MF says that عَفَا is one of those verbs<br>\
that have contr. significations, for at signifies It<br>\
was, or became, unapparent, or imperceptible<br>\
and also It was, or became, apparent, or perceptible: and it has two other contr. significations, which will be mentioned in what follows<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And عَفْوٌ signifies also The act of<br>\
effacing, erasing, rasing, or obliterating. (K,<br>\
TA.) One says, عَفَتِ الرِّيحُ الأَثَرَ, (TA,) or<br>\
المَنْزِلَ, (S, Msb,) and الدَّارَ, (TA,) the wind<br>\
effaced, &amp;c, (S, Msb, TA,) the trace, vestige, or<br>\
footprint, (TA,) or the place of alighting, or<br>\
abode, (S, Msb,) and the house, or dwelling, or<br>\
abode: (TA:) and in like manner, الرِّيحُ ↓ عَفَّتِ<br>\
الدَّارَ, (S, TA,) inf. n. تَعْفِيَةٌ, (TA,) in which the<br>\
verb is with teshdeed to denote intensiveness<br>\
[of the signification, i. e. the wind effaced, &amp;c.,<br>\
mightily, or utterly, the house, or dwelling, or<br>\
abode]: (S, TA:) and عَلَى أَثَرِهِ ↓ عَفَّى It, or he,<br>\
effaced its, or his, trace, vestige, or footprint.<br>\
(MA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence, as some say, عَفَا اللّٰهُ عَنْكَ i. e.<br>\
May God efface [from thee thy sin, &amp;c.; meaning may God absolve thee]; (TA;) or may God<br>\
efface thy sins: (Msb:) [and عُفِىَ عَنْهُ May he<br>\
be absolved, or forgiven, or pardoned:] and hence<br>\
the saying in a trad., سَلُوا اللّٰهَ العَفْوَ i. e. [Ask ye<br>\
of God] the effacement of sin; [or ask ye of God<br>\
absolution, or forgiveness, or pardon;] and ↓ المُعَافَاةَ,<br>\
and ↓ العَافِيَةَ [which have a similar meaning:<br>\
see 3]: (TA:) and one says, عَفَوْتُ عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ,<br>\
meaning I left him, and did not punish him:<br>\
(S:) or عَفَوْتُ عَنْهُ and عَفَوْتُ عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ and عَفَوْتُ<br>\
لَهُ عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ i. e. I turned away from him, or from<br>\
his crime, sin, fault, or offence; syn. صَفَحْتُ عَنْهُ;<br>\
and I turned away (أَعْرَضْتُ) from punishing him:<br>\
(Mgh:) or العَفْوُ signifies the turning away (الصَّفْحُ,<br>\
K, TA) from the committer of a crime or the like;<br>\
(TA;) and the relinquishing the punishment of<br>\
the deserving [thereof]: and one says, عَفَا عَنْهُ<br>\
and عَفَا لَهُ ذَنْبَهُ and عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ [he turned away<br>\
from him, or from his crime, &amp;c; and relinquished the infliction of his merited punishment,<br>\
i. e. forgave him, or pardoned him]: (K, TA:)<br>\
or عَفَا عَنْهُ ذَنْبَهُ and عَفَا لَهُ ذَنْبَهُ and عَنْ ذَنْبِهِ: (so<br>\
accord. to the CK:) accord. to MF, the primary<br>\
signification of العَفْوُ is التَّرْكُ: but this is not the<br>\
case: and الصَّفْحُ [by which it is expl. in the K]<br>\
is [or rather implies] the relinquishing of blame,<br>\
or reproof, or of severe, or angry, blame or<br>\
reproof; and this is more than [is signified by]<br>\
العَفْوُ, for the latter is sometimes without the<br>\
former: the primary signification of العَفْوُ [when<br>\
trans.] is [said to be] the purposing to take a<br>\
thing; and Er-Rághib says that عَفَوْتُ عَنْكَ is as<br>\
though it meant I have purposed to remove [or to<br>\
take away] thy crime or the like: (TA:) [but I<br>\
think that the primary signification of العَفْوُ when<br>\
its object is a crime or the like is that of effacement: and hence likewise what next follows:] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
العَفْوُ is also metaphorically used as meaning (tropical:)  The<br>\
withdrawing from a right, or due, and from seeking, or demanding, it: and thus the verb is used<br>\
in the Kur ii. 238 [q. v.]: and in the saying of<br>\
the Prophet, عَفَوْنَا لَكُمْ عَنْ صَدَقَةِ الخَيْلِ وَالرَّقِيقِ<br>\
[i. e. (tropical:)  We have remitted to you the poor-rate of<br>\
horses and of the slave or slaves]: (Mgh:) [and<br>\
hence] عَفَوْتُ عَنِ الحَقِّ means (assumed tropical:)  I have annulled<br>\
[or remitted] the right, or due; as though I erased<br>\
it from [the account of] him who owed it: (Msb:)<br>\
and عَفَوْتُ لَهُ عَنْ مَا لِى عَلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  I have relinquished<br>\
[or remitted] to him what was due to me on his<br>\
part. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  عَفَا signifies also It was, or became, much in quantity, or many in number:<br>\
(Msb, MF, TA:) and also the contr., i. e. It<br>\
was, or became, little in quantity, or few in number. (MF, TA.) It is said in the former sense<br>\
of hair, and of herbage, &amp;c.: (S:) or, said of<br>\
hair, It was, or became, long, and much in quantity; (TA;) and said of the hair of a camel, (K,)<br>\
or of the hair of a camel&#39;s back, (TA,) it became<br>\
abundant and long, and covered his rump; (K,<br>\
TA;) and said of herbage, it was, or became,<br>\
much in quantity, and tall. (TA.) And عَفَوْا in<br>\
the Kur vii. 93 means They became many, or<br>\
numerous. (S, Msb.) And عَفَتِ الأَرْضُ The land<br>\
became covered with herbage. (K and TK. [In<br>\
the CK, والارضَ is erroneously put for وَالأَرْضُ.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And عَفَوْتُهُ I made it to become much in quantity, or many in number; as also ↓ أَعْفَيْتُهُ; (S, *<br>\
Msb, TA; *) and so ↓ عَفَّيْتُهُ. (TA.) Accord. to<br>\
Es-Sarakustee, one says, عَفَوْتُ الشَّعَرَ, aor. أَعْفُوهُ,<br>\
inf. n. عَفْوٌ; and عَفَيْتُهُ, aor. أَعْفِيهِ, inf. n. عَفَىٌ;<br>\
meaning I left the hair to become abundant and<br>\
long. (Msb.) And one says, اللِّحْيَةَ ↓ اعفى He<br>\
left the beard to become abundant and long, (Mgh,<br>\
K, TA,) having ceased from cutting it: (Mgh:)<br>\
whence, (TA,) it is said in a trad., أَمَرَ أَنْ تُحْفَى<br>\
الشَّوَارِبُ وَتُعْفَى اللُّحَى [He commanded that the<br>\
mustaches should be clipped closely, or much, and<br>\
that the beards should be left to become abundant<br>\
and long]: (S, TA:) or أَحْفُوا الشَّوَارِبَ وَأَعْفُوا<br>\
اللِّحَى [Clip ye &amp;c.], and one may also use the<br>\
unaugmented verb [saying وَاعْفُوا, from عَفَا].<br>\
(Msb, TA.) And شَعَرَ البَعِيرِ ↓ أَعْفَيْتُ, (K,) or<br>\
شَعَرَ ظَهْرِ البَعِيرِ, (TA,) I left the hair of the camel,<br>\
or the hair of the back of the camel, to become<br>\
abundant and long; as also ↓ عَفَّيْتُهُ; (K, TA;)<br>\
this latter with teshdeed. (TA. [In the CK,<br>\
عَفَيْتُهُ.]) عَفَا الصُّوفَ, expl. in the K as signifying<br>\
He shore, or sheared, the wool, signifies he left<br>\
the wool to become abundant and long, then shore,<br>\
or sheared, it. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, inf. n. عَفْوٌ, i. q.<br>\
فَضَلَ or superfluous; or it remained over and above].<br>\
(Msb.) You say, خُذْ مَا صَفَا وَعَفَا, [correctly, مَا<br>\
عَفَا وَصَفَا,] meaning فَضَلَ وَتَسَهَّلَ [i. e. Take thou<br>\
what has exceeded, or become redundant, and has<br>\
become facilitated]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And He exceeded.] You say, عَفَا عَلَيْهِ فِى العِلْمِ He exceeded<br>\
him in knowledge; syn. زَادَ. (K.) And هُوَ يَعْفُو<br>\
عَلَى مُنْيَةِ المُتَمَنِّى وَسُؤَالِ السَّائِلِ He exceeds, in<br>\
giving, the wish of the wisher and the petition of<br>\
the petitioner. (TA.) And عَفَوْتُ لَهُ بِمَالِى I<br>\
exceeded to him [what was incumbent on me] with<br>\
my property, and gave him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And عَفَا,<br>\
aor. يَعْفُو, signifies also [simply] He gave. (TA.)<br>\
And ↓ اعفاهُ He gave to him, namely, one seeking,<br>\
or demanding, his beneficence. (Ham pp. 377<br>\
and 723.) And بِحَقِّهِ ↓ اعفاهُ He gave to him<br>\
fully, or wholly, his right, or due. (Har p. 117.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And عَفَوْتُ لَهُ مِنَ المَرَقِ I laded out for him<br>\
first, and gave to him in preference, some of the<br>\
broth. (S. [See عِفَاوَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  And عَفَوْتُ القِدْرَ<br>\
I left in the bottom of the cooking-pot [as a<br>\
gratuity for the lender thereof] the last of the<br>\
broth, which is termed the عُفَاوَة. (S.)<br>\
-A4-  And<br>\
عَفَوْتُ الرَّجُلَ I asked, or petitioned, the man.<br>\
(Msb.) And عَفَوْتُهُ and ↓ اِعْتَفَيْتُهُ I came to him<br>\

فُلَانٌ تَعْفُوهُ الأَضْيَافُ and ↓ تَعْتَفِيهِ [Such a one,<br>\

or [restored him to health, or soundness, and to<br>\
security from punishment, i. e.] effaced from him<br>\
diseases, and sins. (Msb. See also 1, former<br>\
half.) And عُوفِىَ and ↓ اعفى [the latter perhaps<br>\
أَعْفَى, but more probably, I think, أُعْفِىَ, agreeably with what here precedes,] are both used in<br>\
the same sense, said of a sick person [as meaning<br>\
He was restored to health, or soundness]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\

what occurs between you,] means let every one of<br>\
you turn away from [or relinquish] punishing his<br>\
fellow; the phrase being elliptical, or the verb<br>\
being made to imply the meaning of التَّرْك, and<br>\
therefore being made trans. in the same manner<br>\
as الترك: [hence,] لَوْ تَعَافَيْتُهَا is used by El-<br>\
Hareeree as meaning If I relinquished them:<br>\
(Har p. 60:) [and hence it is said that التَّعَافِى<br>\
signifies التَّجَاوُزُ [app. when each is followed by<br>\
عَنْ, and thus meaning The passing by, or over,<br>\
another, or one another, without punishing]. (TA.)<br>\
