them: (ISh, L:) and he removed to a distance<br>\

and acknowledged the truth, but scorned to have<br>\
it said of him that he followed the son of his<br>\

of the former; [but it should be observed that<br>\
عارضه bears the signification expressed above and<br>\
also that given in the sentence next following;])<br>\
or عَارَضَهُ بِالخِلَافِ; (O in explanation of the latter,<br>\
and Msb in explanation of the former, as on the<br>\
authority of Az [in the T], and K in explanation<br>\
of both;) or خَالَفَهُ: (MA in explanation of the<br>\
former:) [this is the sense in which the former is<br>\
most commonly known: or as meaning he contended with him in an altercation; or did so<br>\
vehemently, or obstinately: (see 6:)] the author<br>\
of the T, however, says, the common people expl.<br>\
يُعَانِدُهُ as meaning he does the contrary of what<br>\
he [another] does; but this I know not [as occurring in the genuine language of the Arabs], nor<br>\
do I admit it as of established authority. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And, sometimes, He imitated him, doing the<br>\

and بَارَاهُ; (T and TA in explanation of the former;) عِنَادٌ sometimes signifying مُعَارَضَةٌ بِغَيْرِ<br>\
خِلَافٍ, as is said by As, who derives it from عَنَدُ<br>\
الحُبَارَى, making عَنَد in this phrase a subst. from<br>\
عاند الحُبَارَى فَرْخَهُ The bustard imitated the actions<br>\
of his young one in flying, on the first occasion of<br>\
its rising, as though he would teach it to fly: and<br>\

(K,) also signifies He kept, or clave, to him, or<br>\

assigned to it above. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And مُعَانَدَةٌ<br>\
means also The disputing with another without<br>\
knowledge of the truth or falsity of what he himself says and also of what his opponent says.<br>\
(Kull p. 342.)<br>\
4<br>\

places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اعند فى قَيْئِهِ (tropical:)  He vomited<br>\
with successive discharges, (S, O, L, K, TA,) and<br>\
copiously; (TA;) and اعند القَىْءَ signifies the<br>\
same. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [اعند is also said by Freytag,<br>\
as on the authority of the Deewán of the Hudhalees, to signify He, and it, (namely, a man, and<br>\
blood,) went away.]<br>\
-A2-  اعندهُ: see 3, in two<br>\
places.<br>\

-b2-  اِسْتَعْنَدَنِى مِنْ بَيْنِ القَوْمِ He directed his<br>\
course towards me, or sought me, [singling me out]<br>\

-b3-<br>\
استعند said of a camel, and of a horse, He gained<br>\
the mastery over the nose-rein, and over the halter,<br>\
or leading-rope, (K, TA,) and resisted being led:<br>\
(TA:) or استعند البَعِيرُ الصَّبِىَّ the camel overcame<br>\
the boy by gaining the mastery over the nose-rein,<br>\
and dragged it, or him, along: and in like manner, استعند الفَرَسُ الرَّسَنَ [the horse gained the<br>\
mastery over the halter, or leading-rope]. (O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  استعندهُ said of vomit, (A, O, K, *) and of<br>\

forth from him copiously: (A:) and ↓ عَنَدَهُ signifies the same. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  استعند عَصَاهُ He<br>\
struck, or smote, with his staff among the people.<br>\
(O, K.) And [in like manner] استعند ذَكَرَهُ (O,<br>\
K) i. e. زَنَى فِى النَّاسِ (O) or زَنَى بِهِ فِيهِمْ. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And استعند السِقَآءَ He doubled the mouth of<br>\

TA.)<br>\
عَنْدٌ: and عَنْدَ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
عُنْدٌ: and عُنْدَ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
عِنْدٌ and ↓ عَنْدٌ and ↓ عُنْدٌ, (O, K,) accord. to<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Abbád, (O,) i. q. نَاحِيَةٌ [app. as meaning<br>\
The vicinage, or the quarter, tract, region, or<br>\
place, of a person or thing]: (O, K:) whence<br>\
the saying, هُوَ عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ الآنَ [He is in the<br>\
vicinage, or the quarter, &amp;c., of such a one, now].<br>\
(O.) [See also عَنَدٌ, which has a similar meaning.]<br>\
-A2-  عِنْدَ and ↓ عَنْدَ and ↓ عُنْدَ signify the<br>\
same, (S, O, Msb, Mughnee, K,) being dial. vars.,<br>\
(S, O, Msb,) the first of which is the most common, (Mughnee,) and the most chaste: (Msb:)<br>\
each is an adv. n. of place, and also of time; (S,<br>\
O, Msb, Mughnee, K;) [used in the manner of<br>\
a prep., though properly a prefixed noun;] of<br>\
place when prefixed to a noun signifying a place<br>\
[or anything local]; (TA;) of time when prefixed<br>\
to a noun signifying a time: (Msb, TA:) denoting<br>\
presence, (S, O,) i. e. perceptible presence, and<br>\
also ideal presence, or rather the place of presence; (Mughnee;) and nearness, (S, O, Mughnee,) or the place of nearness; (Mughnee;) or<br>\
the utmost nearness, and therefore it has no dim.;<br>\
(T, TA;) [i. e.] it is primarily used in relation<br>\
to that which is present with a person [or thing],<br>\
in any adjacent part or quarter with respect to<br>\
that person [or thing]; or in relation to that<br>\
which is near to a person [or thing]: (Msb:)<br>\
[thus it signifies At, near, nigh, by, near by, or<br>\
close by, a place, or thing; with, present with, or<br>\
in the presence of, a person or persons, or a thing<br>\
or things; at the abode of a person; at the place<br>\
of, or in the region of, a thing; or among, or<br>\
amongst, persons or things: and at, near, nigh,<br>\
or about, a time; and at, or on, or upon, denoting<br>\
the occasion of an event or an action:] ―<br>\
-b2-  using<br>\
it as an adv. n. of place, you say عِنْدَ البَيْتِ [At,<br>\
near, nigh, by, near by, or close by, the house or<br>\
tent]; (TA;) and عِنْدَ الحَائِطِ [At, near, nigh,<br>\
&amp;c., the wall]; (S, O;) [and عِنْدِى زَيْدٌ With<br>\
me, present with me, in my presence, or at my<br>\
abode, is Zeyd; and كُنْتُ عِنْدَ القَوْمِ I was with,<br>\
or among, the people, or party; and] فَلَمَّا رَآهُ<br>\
مُسْتَقِرًّا عِنْدَهُ [And when he saw it standing in his<br>\
presence (in the Kur xxvii. 40)] is an ex. of its<br>\
use as denoting presence perceptible by sense:<br>\
and it is used as denoting nearness in the phrase<br>\
عِنْدَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنْتَهَى [Nigh to the lote-tree of the<br>\
ultimate point of access (in the Kur liii. 14)]:<br>\
(Mughnee:) you say also, عِنْدِى مَالٌ, meaning<br>\
With me, or by me, i. e. present with me, is property; and meaning also in my possession, and in<br>\
my power and at my disposal, is property, though<br>\
absent from me; I have, or possess, property;<br>\
(Msb, Mughnee; *) and لِى عِنْدَهُ مَالٌ [I have<br>\
property in his hands, or possession; or there is<br>\
property due to me in his hands, or possession;<br>\
meaning, owed to me by him]; as also قِبَلَهُ: (TA<br>\
in art. قبل:) hence it is used in relation to attributes; so that one says, عِنْدَهُ خَيْرٌ وَفَضْلٌ [He has,<br>\
or possesses, goodness and excellence]; and مَا عنِدَهُ<br>\
شَرٌّ [He has not evil]: and hence the saying in<br>\
the Kur [xxviii. 27], فَإِنْ أَتْمَمْتَ عَشْرًا فَمِنْ عِنْدِكَ<br>\
i. e. [And if thou complete ten years, it will be] of<br>\
thy redundant bounty; (Msb;) [or of thine own<br>\
freewill; as is implied in the explanation by Bd,<br>\
and agreeably with common usage:] and it is<br>\
used as denoting ideal presence in the phrase<br>\
قَالَ الَّذِى عِنْدَهُ عِلْمٌ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ [He with whom was,<br>\
i. e. who possessed, knowledge the of Scripture said<br>\
(in the Kur xxvii. 40)]: (Mughnee:) [hence also]<br>\
one says, لِى عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ حَاجَةٌ [I have an object of<br>\
want to be sought, or required, at the hand of such<br>\
a one, or a want to be supplied on the part of such<br>\
a one; meaning I want a thing of such a one; as<br>\
also قِبَلَ فُلَانٍ]: (TA in art. حوج:) [and in like<br>\
manner one says of a right or due (حَقٌّ): and<br>\
طَلَبَ حَاجَةً عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ He sought an object of<br>\
want at the hand of such a one: (see an ex. in<br>\
art. علو, conj. 3:)] ―<br>\
-b3-  using it as an adv. n. of<br>\
time, you say عِنْدَ الصُّبْحِ [At, near, nigh, or<br>\
about, daybreak]; (Msb, TA;) and عِنْدَ اللَّيْلِ<br>\
[At, near, nigh, or about, night]; (S, O;) and<br>\
جِئْتُكَ عِنْدَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ [I came to thee at, near,<br>\
&amp;c., the rising of the sun]; (Mughnee;) [and عِنْدَ<br>\
ذٰلِكَ At, on, upon, or on the occasion of, that<br>\
event; thereupon; and عِنْدَمَا فَعَلَ كَذَا At, on,<br>\
upon, or on the occasion of, his doing such a<br>\
thing.] ―<br>\
-b4-  It admits before it the prep. مِنْ, (S,<br>\
O, Msb, Mughnee, K,) but no other prep.; (S,<br>\
O, Msb;) like as does لَدُنْ: (S, O:) as in the<br>\
saying, جِئْتُ مِنْ عِنْدِهِ [I came from his presence,<br>\
or his vicinage: or I came from him; for in this<br>\
case it may be considered as redundant]: (Msb:)<br>\
and in the saying آتَيْنَاهُ رَحْمَةً مِنْ عِنْدِنَا وَعَلَّمْنَاهُ<br>\
مِنْ لَدُنَّا عِلْمًا [Upon whom we had bestowed mercy<br>\
from us, and whom we had taught, from us,<br>\
knowledge (in the Kur xviii. 64)]: (Mughnee:)<br>\
[and in an ex. above, from the Kur xxviii. 27:<br>\
and one says of a gift, هٰذَا مِنْ عِنْدِى, meaning<br>\
This is from, or of, my property; or from me;<br>\
or, by way of emphasis, from myself:] one should<br>\
not say [as the vulgar do], مَضَيْتُ إِلَى عِنْدِكَ;<br>\
nor إِلَى لَدُنْكَ. (S, O, K. *) ―<br>\
-b5-  Being a vague<br>\
adv. n., (T, TA,) it may not be used otherwise<br>\
than as an adv. n., (T, S, O, K, TA,) except in<br>\
the following case: (T, O, TA:) one says of a<br>\
thing without knowing it, هٰذَا عِنْدِى كَذَا [This is<br>\
in my judgment, or opinion, thus]; and thereupon<br>\
another says, أَوَلَكَ عِنْدٌ [And hast thou a judgment, or an opinion?]: (T, A, * O, * K, * TA:)<br>\
and in like manner one says,<br>\
وَمَنْ أَنْتُمُ حَتَّى يَكُونَ لَكُمْ عِنْدٌ<br>\
[And who are ye, that ye should have a judgment,<br>\
or an opinion?]: (TA:) and thus in the saying, (Mughnee, TA,) of one of the Muwelleds,<br>\
(Mughnee,)<br>\
لَا يُسَاوِى نِصْفَ عِنْدِ  كُلَّ عِنْدٍ لَكَ عِنْدِى<br>\
[Every judgment, or opinion, of thine, in my<br>\
judgment, or opinion, will not equal the half of a<br>\
judgment, or an opinion]: (Mughnee, TA:) they<br>\
assert that عِنْد in this case means the mind, (T,<br>\
O, * K, * TA,) i. e. القَلْب, and المَعْقُول, (O, K,)<br>\
or القَلْب and مَا فِيهِ مَعْقُولُ اللُّبِّ; (T, TA;) [as<br>\
in the phrase بُرْ لِى مَا عِنْدَ فُلَانٍ, expl. in the S,<br>\
in art. بور, as meaning Try thou, or examine, and<br>\
learn, for me, what is in the mind (نَفْس) of such<br>\
a one; and in many other instances:] but this<br>\
assertion is not valid: (T, TA:) [in a case of<br>\
this kind] it means judgment [or opinion]: thus<br>\
one says, هٰذَا عِنْدِى أَفْضَلُ مِنْ هٰذَا i. e. [This is]<br>\
in my judgment [more excellent than this]: (Msb:)<br>\
and أَنْتَ عِنْدِى ذَاهِبٌ i. e. [Thou art] in my<br>\
opinion [going away]: (Fr, Th, TA:) and هٰذَا<br>\
القَوْلُ عِنْدِى صَوَابٌ [This saying is in my judgment, or opinion, right, or correct]: (Mughnee:)<br>\
[and in like manner, عِنْدَ اللّٰهِ is generally best<br>\
rendered In the estimation, or sight, of God.] ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
[Sometimes it denotes comparison: see an ex.<br>\
voce تَعَاظَمَ.] ―<br>\
-b7-  It is also sometimes used to denote incitement, (S, O, K,) being in this case prefixed [to كَ or the like]; not alone: (MF:) yon<br>\
say, عِنْدَكَ زَيْدًا, meaning Take thou Zeyd. (S,<br>\
O, K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And in cautioning a person respecting<br>\
a thing before him, one says, عِنْدَكَ, [meaning<br>\
Keep thou where thou art; and it is still used in<br>\
this sense;] in which case it is an intrans. verbal<br>\
noun. (Sb, L, TA.)<br>\
عَنَدٌ The side [of a thing]; syn. جَانِبٌ. (S, A,<br>\
O, L, K. [See also عِنْدٌ, first sentence.]) One<br>\
says, يَمْشِى وَسَطًا لَا عَنَدًا [He walks in the middle,<br>\
not on, or at, one side]. (S, O.) And عَنَدَهْ, [for<br>\
عَنَدَهُ,] occurring at the end of a verse [of which<br>\
I find several different readings, and which I<br>\
have cited accord. to one of those readings voce<br>\
حُبَارَى], means by its side: (O, L:) but Th says,<br>\
in explaining that verse, as describing the حُبَارَى<br>\
teaching its young one to fly, that العَنَدُ signifies<br>\
الاِعْتِرَاضُ: [so that عَنَدَهْ there, accord. to him,<br>\
app. means اِعْتِرَاضًا لَهُ, which may be rendered<br>\
presenting itself before it:] or, accord. to As,<br>\
[عَنَدَهْ there means imitating its actions in flying;<br>\
for he says that] عَنَدٌ is a subst. from عَانَدَ الحُبَارَى<br>\
فَرْخَهُ [expl. above: see 3]. (L.)<br>\
طَعْنٌ عَنِدٌ A thrusting [with a spear or the like]<br>\
to the right and left. (S, O.) [See also عَانِدٌ.]<br>\
عُنْدَدٌ or عُنْدُدٌ, (accord. to different copies of<br>\
the S,) or both, (O, L, K,) in which the radical<br>\
letters are said to be عند because of the duplication of the د, and because ن when it occupies the<br>\
second place in a word is not considered augmentative unless proved to be so, (L,) An avoiding, or escaping: (S, O, L, K:) and the former,<br>\
artifice. (AZ, O, K.) One says, مَا لِى عَنْهُ عُنْدَدٌ<br>\
and عُنْدُدٌ (Lh, L, K, and written, as on the<br>\
authority of AZ, in both these ways in the O and<br>\
in different copies of the S, but with مِنْهُ in the<br>\
place of عَنْهُ,) and ↓ مُعْلَنْدَدٌ (S, O, L, K) and<br>\
↓ مُعْلَنْدِدٌ, (K,) meaning I have no way of avoiding it, or escaping it. (AZ, Lh, S, O, L, K.) And<br>\
مَا وَجَدْتُ إِلَى ذٰلِكَ عُنْدَدًا and عُنْدُدًا (Lh, L) and<br>\
↓ مُعْلَنْدَدًا (Lh, S, O) and ↓ مُعْلَنْدِدًا (Lh, O) I<br>\
found no way of attaining to that: (Lh, S, O,<br>\
L:) and ↓ مَا لِى إِلَيْهِ مُعْلَنْدِدٌ (Lh, L in art. علد,<br>\
and K) and ↓ مُعْلَنْدَدٌ (Lh, L) I have no way of<br>\
attaining to it. (Lh, L, K.) [See also art. علد.]<br>\
-A2-  عُنْدَدٌ also signifies Old, or ancient. (AA,<br>\
O, K.)<br>\
[<br>\
عِنْدِيَّةٌ A saying عِنْدِى, meaning In my opinion;<br>\
an assertion of mere opinion of one&#39;s own. Hence<br>\
the phrase, هٰذَا مِنْ عِنْدِيَّاتِهِ (occurring in the TA<br>\
in art. جرب) This is one of his assertions of<br>\
mere opinion.]<br>\
عِنْدَأْوٌ and عِنْدَأْوَةٌ: see art. عندأ.<br>\
عَنُودٌ One who declines, or deviates, from the<br>\
right way, or course; (S, O, L;) as also ↓ عَنِيدٌ.<br>\
(L.) See also عَانِدٌ as applied to a camel. ―<br>\
-b2-  A<br>\
she-camel that deviates from the road by reason<br>\
of her sprightliness and strength: pl. عُنُدٌ and<br>\
عُنَّدٌ; or, as ISd thinks, this latter is pl. of ↓ عَانِدٌ,<br>\
not of عَنُودٌ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A she-camel that pastures<br>\
aside; (S, O;) that does not mix with the other<br>\
camels, but removes to a distance from them, and<br>\
always pastures aside; as also ↓ عَانِدٌ and عَانِدَةٌ,<br>\
(L;) that does not mix with the other camels, but<br>\
is always apart from them; (IAth;) that is on<br>\
one side of the other camels: (IAar and Aboo-Nasr:) pl. of the first عُنُدٌ; (S, O, L;) and of<br>\
the second and third, عُنَّدٌ and عَوَانِدُ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  A<br>\
