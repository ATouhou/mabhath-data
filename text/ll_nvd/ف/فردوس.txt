فَرْدَسَهُ, (O, K,) inf. n. فَرْدَسَةٌ, (Kr, M, O,)<br>\
He threw him down, prostrate, on the ground,<br>\
(Kr, M, O, K,) in an evil, or abominable, manner:<br>\
(Kr, M, O:) and flung him upon the ground; lit.,<br>\
smote with him the ground. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فَرْدَسَ<br>\
الجُلَّةَ He filled, or stuffed, compactly, the [receptacle for dates, termed] جُلَّة. (AA, O, * K.)<br>\
فَرْدَسَةٌ Width; amplitude: (M, O, Msb, K:)<br>\
whence is derived the word فِرْدَوْسٌ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
accord. to Fr. (Msb.)<br>\
فِرْدَوْسٌ A garden: (S, Msb:) so in the Greek<br>\
language [<br>\
παράδεισο�]: (M:) or a garden comprising everything that is in gardens: (Zj, M, A,<br>\
O, K:) such is the proper signification; (Zj, M,<br>\
O;) and so with the people of every language:<br>\
(Zj, M:) and containing grape-vines: (Fr, O, K:)<br>\
or a garden in which are grape-vines: (IAmb, M,<br>\
Msb:) or a place in which are grape-vines: (TA:)<br>\
or an ample, beautiful garden: (A:) or a garden<br>\
comprising grape-vines and palm-trees: (Bd in<br>\
xviii. 107:) or with the Arabs it signifies a<br>\
valley abounding with herbage, like a garden:<br>\
(M:) or a valley, (Zj, Msb,) or valleys, (O, K,)<br>\
producing various sorts of plants or herbage: (Zj,<br>\
O, Msb, K:) in the K, for الأَوْدِيَةُ الَّتِى تُنْبِتُ, we<br>\
should read مِنَ الأَوْدِيَةِ الَّتِى تُنْبِتُ; (TK;) [or<br>\
rather, مِنَ الأَوْدِيَةِ مَا يُنْبِتُ, as in the Msb:] or a<br>\
meadow; syn. رَوْضَةٌ: (Seer, M:) and the greenness of grapes (أَعْنَاب), (so in a copy of the M,)<br>\
or of herbs (أَعْشَاب): (so in the TA:) masc. and<br>\
fem.: (Msb:) sometimes the latter; (K;) as in<br>\
the Kur xxiii. 11, because, by الفِرْدَوْسَ is there<br>\
meant الجَنَّةَ: (O, TA:) it is an Arabic word, (S,<br>\
O, Msb, K,) accord. to Fr, (S, O, Msb,) occurring in a verse cited voce ثَوَابٌ, which is by<br>\
Hassán Ibn-Thábit, (O,) derived from فَرْدَسَةٌ,<br>\
meaning “ width ” or “ amplitude,” (Msb, K, *)<br>\
accord. to Fr: (Msb:) or it is Greek, (Zj, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) transferred to the Arabic language;<br>\
(Zj, O, Msb;) [i. e., arabicised: but as it occurs<br>\
in the Kur (xviii. 107 and xxiii. 11), this is contr.<br>\
to the opinion of Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee and others, who<br>\
deny that any arabicized word occurs therein:<br>\
(see سُنْدُسٌ:)] or it is Syriac: (Zj, O, K:) the<br>\
pl. is فَرَادِيسُ; (A, TA;) which is applied by the<br>\
people of Syria to gardens and grape-vines. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (Bd in xviii. 107,) الفِرْدَوْسُ [Paradise: or] a garden of trees, or walled garden,<br>\
(حَدِيقَةٌ,) in الجَنَّة [or Paradise]: (S:) or the<br>\
highest of the stages of الجَنَّة: (Bd, ubi suprà:)<br>\
or the middle and highest part of الجَنَّة. (Jel,<br>\
ibid.)<br>\
فُرْدُوسٌ Increase (نَزَل, in the CK نُزُل,) that is<br>\
in طَعَام [i. e. wheat]: (O, K:) mentioned by<br>\
IDrd, as heard from some persons of ElBahreyn. (O.)<br>\
فُرَادِسٌ A man big in the bones. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád,<br>\
O, K.)<br>\
مُفَرْدَسٌ A trellised grape-vine; syn. مُعَرَّشٌ.<br>\
