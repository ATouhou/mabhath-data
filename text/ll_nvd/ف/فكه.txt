فَكِهَ, aor.<br>\
فَكَهَ, inf. n. فَكَاهَةٌ (S, Mgh, K) and<br>\
فَكَهٌ, (K, TA,) [the latter inf. n. correctly thus,<br>\
agreeably with a general rule, in the CK with<br>\
the ك quiescent, but said in the TA to be<br>\
بالتحريك,] (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, cheerful, happy,<br>\
or free from straitness; (S, Mgh, K;) jocose, or<br>\
given to jesting, (S, Mgh,) and to laughing: (Mgh,<br>\
K:) or one who talked to his companions and<br>\
made them to laugh. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5.<br>\
2<br>\
فَكَّهَهُمْ, inf. n. تَفْكِيهٌ, He brought to them<br>\
فَاكِهَة [i. e. fruit]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] فَكَّهَهُمْ<br>\
بِمُلَحِ الكَلَامِ, inf. n. as above, (tropical:)  He entertained<br>\
them in a novel manner with facetious sayings or<br>\
talk. (K, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
فاكههُ, (K,) inf. n. مُفَاكَهَةٌ, (S,) (tropical:)  He jested,<br>\
or joked, with him; (S, K, TA;) indulged in<br>\
pleasantry with him. (TA.) It is said in a prov.,<br>\
لَا تُفَاكِهْ أَمَةً وَلَاتَبُلْ عَلَى أَكَمَةٍ (tropical:)  [Jest not thou<br>\
with a female slave, and make not water upon a<br>\
hillock, i. e. and publish not what is secret of thine<br>\
affair: see art. اكم]. (S, TA.) [See also an<br>\
ex. in a verse cited voce تَزَنَّدَ.]<br>\
4<br>\
أَفْكَهَتْ She (a camel) yielded her milk plentifully on the occasion of eating the [herbage called]<br>\
رَبِيع, before her bringing forth: (S, TA:) or she<br>\
being near to bringing forth, her صَلَوَانِ [app.<br>\
meaning two parts on the right and left of the<br>\
tail (see صَلًا in art. صلو)] became lax, or flaccid,<br>\
and her udder became large; like أَفَكَّت. (TA in<br>\
art. فك. [See also the part. n., below.])<br>\
5<br>\
تفكّه He ate fruit (فَاكِهَة): (Msb, K:) and<br>\
He took fruit with his hand, [he helped himself<br>\
to it;] syn. تَنَاوَلَ الفَاكِهَةَ: and hence, as is said<br>\
in the A, (TA,) the saying in the Kur [lvi. 65],<br>\
فَظَلْتُمْ تَفَكَّهُونَ is ironical, meaning [And then ye<br>\
would be in the condition of] making your fruit<br>\
to be your saying إِنَّا لَمُغْرَمُونَ Verily we are burdened with debt (which words occur in the next<br>\
verse)]: or تَفَكَّهَ here [or rather in a case of this<br>\
kind] means He threw away from himself the<br>\
fruit: thus says Ibn-&#39;Ateeyeh, (K, TA,) in his<br>\
exposition: (TA:) [but see other explanations<br>\
in what follows:] and it signifies also He<br>\
abstained from fruit: thus it bears two contr.<br>\
meanings. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And sometimes [it means<br>\
(tropical:)  He amused himself with talk; like as one<br>\
amuses himself with the eating of fruit after a<br>\
meal; i. e.] التَّفَكُّهُ is metaphorically used as<br>\
meaning التَّنَقُّلُ بِالحَدِيثِ. (Bd in lvi. 65.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And (assumed tropical:)  He affected jesting, or joking. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And تفكّهوا بِفُلَانٍ (assumed tropical:) They spoke evil of such a one;<br>\
or did so in his absence; and defamed him; and<br>\
did thus with jesting, one with another. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And تفكّه بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He enjoyed it: (S, Msb, K:) and<br>\
[particularly] (Msb) he enjoyed the eating of it.<br>\
(Mgh, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And تفكّه also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
wondered, (S, Msb, K,) مِنْهُ at it; and so ↓ فَكِهَ,<br>\
followed likewise by منه. (K.) And hence<br>\
[accord. to some] the saying in the Kur cited<br>\
above, فَظَلْتُمْ تَفَكَّهُونَ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [And then ye would be<br>\
in the condition of] wondering at what had<br>\
befallen you in respect of your seed-produce.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And He repented, grieved, lamented,<br>\
or regretted: (IAar, S, K:) and the words of<br>\
the Kur cited in the last sentence above, (S, TA,)<br>\
as expl. by some, (TA,) mean [And then ye would<br>\
be in the condition of] repenting, &amp;c.: (S, TA:)<br>\
and so تَفَكَّنُونَ, which is of the dial. of &#39;Okl; or,<br>\
accord. to Lh, Temeem say تَتَفَكَّنُونَ, and AzdShanoo-ah say تَتَفَكَّهُونَ. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَفَاكُهٌ signifies The jesting, or joking, [or<br>\
indulging in pleasantry, (see 3,) of a number of<br>\
persons,] one with another, (K.) [You say,<br>\
تفاكهوا They jested, &amp;c., one with another.]<br>\
فَكِهٌ Eating, or an eater of, فَاكِهَة [i. e. fruit];<br>\
(K, TA;) a possessive epithet; applied to a man.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S, Mgh, K,) and ↓ فَاكِهٌ, (K,<br>\
TA, in the CK فَاكِهَةٌ,) and ↓ فيكهان [app. فَيْكَهَانٌ<br>\
or فَيْكِهَانٌ, like تيَّهَانٌ], (AZ, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  Cheerful,<br>\
happy, or free from straitness; (AZ, S, Mgh, K;)<br>\
jocose, or given to jesting, (AZ, S, Mgh,) and to<br>\
laughing: (Mgh, K:) or the first, (K, TA,) and<br>\
second, (K,) one who talks to his companions and<br>\
makes them to laugh: (K, TA:) and فَكِهَاتٌ,<br>\
applied to women, cheerful, happy, or free from<br>\
straitness. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فَكِهٌ signifies also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Exulting, or rejoicing above measure; or exulting greatly, and behaving insolently and unthankfully, or ungratefully: (S, TA:) and thus the<br>\
pl. فَكِهِينَ signifies in the Kur (S, Mgh) xlix. 26<br>\
[as some there read]: (S:) ↓ فَاكِهِينَ [is the more<br>\
common reading and] means enjoying an easy and<br>\
a pleasant life; or enjoying case and plenty. (S,<br>\
Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  Wondering: and thus some<br>\
explain the pl. فَكِهُونَ in the Kur xxxvi. 55.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  هُوَ فَكِهٌ بِأَعْرَاضِ النَّاسِ means (tropical:)  He is one<br>\
who delights in speaking evil of men, or in doing<br>\
so in their absence. (K, TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
فَكِيهْ is said by Golius to signify “ Qui proloqui<br>\
non potest,” on the authority of the KL: but in<br>\
my copy of the KL, I find that the word to<br>\
which this meaning is assigned is فَهِيهٌ.]<br>\
فُكَاهَةٌ, a subst. [as distinguished from the inf. n.<br>\
فَكَاهَةٌ], (S, K,) A jesting, or joking; (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K;) as also ↓ فَكِيهَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
فَكِيهَةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
فَاكِهٌ Possessing فَاكِهَة [i. e. fruit]; (K, TA:)<br>\
an epithet of the same class as تَامِرٌ and لَابِنٌ: or,<br>\
accord. to Aboo-Mo&#39;ádh the grammarian, one<br>\
whose fruit has become abundant. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also فَكِهٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  And [the fem.] فَاكِهَةٌ,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A palm-tree (نَخْلَةٌ) inducing wonder, or admiration, and pleasure, or joy; or pleasing, or (??)<br>\
joicing; [app. by its having much fruit;] syn.<br>\
مُعْجِبَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
فَاكِهَةٌ a word of well-known meaning, (S,)<br>\
Fruit, of any kind; (K;) a thing, or things, the<br>\
eating whereof is enjoyed, (Mgh, Msb,) whether<br>\
moist or dry, as figs and melons and raisins<br>\
and pomegranates: (Msb:) [the words, of the<br>\
Kur lv. 68, فِيهِمَا فَاكِهَةٌ وَنَخْلٌ وَرُمَّانٌ have<br>\
caused it to be much and vainly disputed whether<br>\
dates and pomegranates be, or be not, included<br>\
among the things termed فاكهة: it seems to be<br>\
the general opinion of the lexicologists that they<br>\
are included; but the contrary opinion is held<br>\
by many of the lawyers, and by the Imám Aboo-<br>\
Haneefeh among them:] the pl. is فَوَاكِهُ, meaning kinds thereof. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (by way of comparison [thereto], TA) (tropical:)  Sweetmeat; syn. حَلْوَآء;<br>\
(K;) which is also applied by some to “ fruit ”<br>\
(فاكهة), (T in art. حلو,) or to “ sweet fruit. ” (K<br>\
in that art.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فَاكِهَةُ الشِّتَآءِ [lit. The fruit<br>\
of winter] is metonymically used as meaning (tropical:)  the<br>\
fire. (Har p. 594.)<br>\
فَاكِهِىٌّ: see فَاكِهَانِىٌّ.<br>\
فيكهان:see فَكِهٌ, second sentence.<br>\
فَاكِهَانِىٌّ A seller of فَاكِهَة [i. e. fruit]; (S, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ فَاكِهِىٌّ; (TA;) but not فَكَّاهٌ. (Sb, TA.)<br>\
كَانَ مِنْ أَفْكَهِ النَّاسِ occurs in two trads. [as<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He was of the most cheerful and jocose<br>\
of men]. (TA [in which the meaning is indicated<br>\
by the context].)<br>\
أُفْكُوهَةٌ i. q. أُعْجُوبَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  [A wonderful thing]. (K.)<br>\
You say, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِأُفْكُوهَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  [Such a one did, or<br>\
uttered, a wonderful thing]. (TA.)<br>\
مُفْكِهٌ (AZ, S, K) and مُفْكِهَةٌ (K) A she-camel<br>\
whose milk is thick, (K, TA,) like biestings: (TA:)<br>\
or that yields her milk plentifully on the occasion<br>\
of eating the [herbage called] رَبِيع, before her<br>\
bringing forth: (S:) or whose milk pours forth<br>\
on the occasion of parturition, before her bringing<br>\
forth: or, accord. to Sh, the meaning is that<br>\
indicated by the second explanation of the verb,<br>\
4 [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
