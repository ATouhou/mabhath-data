فَغَرَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
فَغَرَ (Msb, K)<br>\
and<br>\
فَغُرَ, (AZ, K,) inf. n. فَغْرٌ (Msb, TA) and فُغُورٌ,<br>\
(TA,) He opened his mouth; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ افغر. (Zj, Sgh, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also, both verbs,<br>\
فَغَرَ and ↓ افغر, He, or it, made, or caused, to open<br>\
the mouth. And hence,] فَغَرَ النَّجْمُ, (T, TA,) or<br>\
النَّجْمُ ↓ أَفْغَرَ, (S, O,) i. e., الُّرَيَّا, (T, S, O,) The<br>\
asterism, meaning the Pleiades, became overhead:<br>\
[lit., made one to open his mouth:] (T:) this is in<br>\
the winter: (S, O:) for when the Pleiades are in<br>\
the midst of the sky, he who looks at them opens<br>\
his mouth: (T, S, O:) or the Pleiades began to<br>\
rise [after sunset, so as to be overhead in the middle<br>\
of the night], in the winter. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  فَغَرَ also<br>\
signifies It (the mouth) opened; (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ انفغر: (K:) and the latter is said<br>\
of a blossom, or flower, in the same sense. (S,<br>\
Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فَغَرَتِ السِّنُّ (assumed tropical:)  The tooth<br>\
showed its point; as though it broke forth to<br>\
grow: but some say that its ف is substituted for<br>\
ث, and Az inclines to think so [though ثَغَرَ differs<br>\
much in meaning from فَغَرَ]. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَفْغَرَ and 7: see 1; the former in three places.<br>\
هُوَ وَاسِعُ فَغْرِ الفَمِ He is wide in the opening of<br>\
the mouth. (Lth, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And accord. to Lth,<br>\
(O,) فَغَرٌ signifies also A rose when it opens: (O,<br>\
K:) but it is thought by Az to be, in this sense,<br>\
a mistake for فَغْوٌ, with و. (O.)<br>\
وُلِدَ بِالْفَغْرَةِ He was born at the commencement<br>\
of the rising of the Pleiades [after sunset]; (O, K;)<br>\
which is in the winter. (TA.) See 1.<br>\
فُغْرَةٌ The mouth of a valley: pl. فُغَرٌ. (O, K.)<br>\
طَعْنَةٌ فَغَارِ, the latter word like قَطَامِ, [A spearwound, or the like,] that passes through. (O, K.)<br>\
فَاغِرٌ, an epithet in which the quality of a subst.<br>\
is predominant, (TA,) A [certain] دُوَيْبَّة [i. e.<br>\
small animal, or small creeping thing, or insect],<br>\
(O, K, TA,) always opening its mouth: (O, TA:)<br>\
and another, black and white in the أَنْف [or snout],<br>\
that stings men. (TA.)<br>\
فَاغِرَةٌ A sort of perfume: (S, K, TA:) or (K,<br>\
TA) the roots of the [lotus called] نَيْلُوفَر [q. v.]<br>\
(S, K, TA) of India: (S, TA:) or the كَبَابَة [or<br>\
cubeb] (K, TA) of China; because, when a man<br>\
eats it, he opens his mouth. (TA.)<br>\
مَفْغَرَةٌ A wide tract of land. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
An opening, or a hollow, in a mountain, smaller<br>\
than a كَهْف. (K.)<br>\
