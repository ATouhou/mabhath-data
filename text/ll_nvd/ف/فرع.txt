-A5-  افرع أَهْلَهُ, thus<br>\
in all the copies of the K, expl. as meaning<br>\
كَفَلَهُمْ, and likewise in the O, is a mistranscription by Sgh, whom the author of the K has here<br>\
followed: it is correctly, افرع الَوادِى أَهْلَهُ i. e.<br>\
The valley sufficed its people; syn. كَفَاهُمْ. (TA.)<br>\
-A6-  أُفْرِعَ بِسَيِّدِ بَنِى فُلَانٍ, (O, K,) with damm,<br>\

5<br>\
تفرّعت أَغْصَانُ الشَّجَرِ The branches of the<br>\

(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [See also an ex. in a verse cited voce<br>\

فَرْعٌ The upper, or uppermost, part of anything;<br>\

opposed to أُصُولٌ meaning “ fundamentals,” signifies, in the conventional language of the lawyers and the men of science in general, the derivative institutes of the law, &amp;c.: see 2:] عِلْمُ<br>\
الفُرُوعِ [the science of the derivative institutes of<br>\
the law] is what is commonly known by the<br>\
appellation of عِلْمُ الفِقْهِ [the science of jurisprudence; because it is mainly concerned with institutes derived from fundamentals]. (Hájjee Khaleefeh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (tropical:)  The hair of a woman: pl. as<br>\

(K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also [or قَوْسٌ فَرْعٌ] A bow that is<br>\
made from the extreme portion of a branch, (As,<br>\
S, O, K, TA,) from the head thereof: (As, TA:)<br>\
and (K) a bow that is not [made from a branch]<br>\
divided lengthwise (S, O, K, TA) is called قَوْسٌ<br>\
فَرْعٌ; (S, O, TA;) such as is [made from a<br>\

as an epithet, i. e.] one says قَوْسٌ فَرْعٌ and فَرْعَةٌ.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, i. e. فَرْعٌ, Property that is beneficial, or serviceable, and made ready, or prepared: (O, K, TA:) or, accord. to the S, it is<br>\
↓ فَرَعٌ which has this signification; but this is<br>\
said by Sgh [app. in the TS], and after him by<br>\
the author of the K, to be a mistake; and a verse<br>\
in which it occurs with the ر quiescent is cited in<br>\
the O and K as an ex. of it in this sense: it may<br>\
be, however, that the poet has made the ر quiescent of necessity [by poetic license, for the sake<br>\
of the metre]; or it may here [properly] signify<br>\
“ a branch,” and be metonymically used as meaning recent property. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  See also the next<br>\
paragraph, latter half.<br>\
فَرَعٌ The firstling of the camel, (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) or of the sheep or goat, (L, K,) which<br>\
they used to sacrifice to their gods, (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) looking for a blessing thereby; (S, O,<br>\
Msb;) and ↓ فَرَعَةٌ signifies the same: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) hence, (Mgh, O, K,) it is said in a trad.,<br>\
[implying the prohibition of this custom,] لَا فَرَعَ<br>\
وَلَا عَتِيرَةٌ, (S, O, K, *) or وَلَا عَتِيرَةَ ↓ لَا فَرَعَةَ: (Mgh:<br>\

number for which their owner wished, they sacrificed [a firstling]: (TA:) or when one&#39;s camels<br>\
amounted to a complete hundred, (K, TA,) he<br>\
sacrificed a he-camel thereof every year, and gave<br>\
it to the people to eat, neither he nor his family<br>\
tasting it, or rather, it is said, (TA,) he sacrificed<br>\
a young, or youthful, he-camel to his idol: and<br>\
the Muslims used to do it in the first part of ElIslám: then it was abrogated: (K, TA:) accord.<br>\
to the Bári&#39; and the Mj, the firstling of camels<br>\
and also that of sheep or goats are thus called:<br>\
(Msb:) the pl. [of فَرَعٌ] is فُرُعٌ, with two<br>\
dammehs. (K.) It is said in a prov., أَوَّلُ الصَّيْدِ<br>\
فَرَعٌ [The first of what are taken by the chase or<br>\
the like is a فرع] as being likened to a firstling:<br>\
so says Yezeed Ibn-Murrah. (TA. [See Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Arab. Prov., i. 35.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  The poet Ows Ibn-<br>\
Hajar, (S, O,) or Bishr Ibn-Abee-Kházim, has<br>\
used it as meaning The skin of a فَرَع; (S, O; *)<br>\
suppressing the prefix جِلْد: (S:) for they used<br>\
to clothe with its skin another young one of a<br>\
camel, in order that the mother of the one sacrificed might incline to it [and yield her milk]. (O;<br>\
and the like is said in the TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, and<br>\
↓ فَرْعٌ, Lice: (S, K:) or, as some say, small lice:<br>\

louse. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And the former (فَرَعٌ), Food<br>\
that is prepared [app. for persons invited to partake of it] on the occasion of camels&#39; bringing<br>\
forth; like as خُرْسٌ signifies such as is on the<br>\

فَرْعَةٌ A high, or an elevated, place of a mountain: pl. فِرَاعٌ: so in the saying, اِيْتِ فَرْعَةً مِنْ<br>\
فِرَاعِ الجَبَلِ فَانْزِلْهَا [Come thou to one of the high<br>\

-b2-  And<br>\
فَرْعَةُ الجُلَّةِ The highest, or uppermost, of the dates<br>\

The highest part of the road, and the place where<br>\
it ends: or the conspicuous and elevated part<br>\
thereof: or ↓ فَارِعَتُهُ signifies the sides, or borders,<br>\
thereof. (TA. [See also قَارِعَةُ الطَّرِيقِ.]) ―<br>\

asterism of the فُرُوعِ; a long day]: (S, * O, TA:)<br>\
in the S, وَظَلَّ لَنَا; but correctly لَهَا, meaning to<br>\
the she-asses: (TA:) and Aboo-Sa&#39;eed related it<br>\
as above with the unpointed ع in الفروع: (S, *<br>\
TA:) in the same manner, also, it is expl. by<br>\
him as used in the phrase فَيْحُ نَجْمِ الفُرُوعِ [which<br>\
I would render the vehement raging of the heat of<br>\
the asterism of the فروع] in a verse of Umeiyeh<br>\
Ibn-Abee-&#39;Áïdh: El-Jumahee related it differently,<br>\
with غ; but the فُرُوغ [or rather the فَرْغَانِ] are of<br>\
the stars of Aquarius; and the season thereof [i. e.<br>\
of their auroral rising] is cold; there is then no<br>\
فيح. (TA.)<br>\
فُرَيْعٌ, occurring [with tenween, perfectly decl.,]<br>\
in a verse of Umeiyeh Ibn-Abi-s-Salt, (O, K,)<br>\
i. q. ↓ فِرْعَوْنُ, (O,) which is a proper name of<br>\
such as was King of the Amalekites [or rather<br>\
of the ancient Egyptians, in general], like as<br>\
قَيْصَر was of the Room [or Greeks of the Lower<br>\
Empire], and كِسْرَى of the Persians, (Ksh in ii.<br>\
46,) [and also] a foreign word, (Msb,) [wherefore<br>\
it is imperfectly decl., in Hebr.<br>\
פַּרְעֹה, i. e. Pharaoh,] a dial. var. of فِرْعَوْنُ, or used by poetic<br>\
license: (K:) the pl. of the latter is فَرَاعِنَةٌ.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
فِرْعَوْنُ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
فَارِعٌ [Overtopping, or surpassing in height or<br>\
tallness: this seems to be the primary signification]. You say جَبَلٌ فَارِعٌ A mountain higher, or<br>\
taller, than what is next to it. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
High, or tall; applied to a man, and to an<br>\
extended gibbous piece of sand. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
High, or elevated; goodly in form or aspect or<br>\
appearance; beautiful: (Aboo-&#39;Adnán, O, K:)<br>\
or [simply] high [app. in rank or dignity]:<br>\
(IAar, O:) and also low, ignoble, or mean:<br>\
(IAar, O, K:) thus having two contr. significations. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And a man of the Arabs said,<br>\
↓ لَقِيتُ فُلَانًا فَارِعًا مُفْرِعًا, meaning [I met such a<br>\
one] one of us ascending and the other descending.<br>\
(S, O, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also sing. of فَرَعَةٌ, which signifies The armed attendants, or guards, of the<br>\
Sultán, or sovereign: (O, K, TA:) it is like<br>\
وَازِعٌ. (TA.)<br>\
فَارِعَةٌ The higher, or highest, part of a mountain<br>\
[and of a valley]: one says, اِنْزِلْ بِفَارِعَةِ الوَادِى<br>\
وَاحْذَرْ أَسْفَلَهُ [Alight thou in the higher, or highest,<br>\
part of the valley, and beware of its lower, or<br>\
lowest, part]. (S, O.) See also فَرْعَةٌ, in two<br>\
places. ―<br>\
-b2-  الفَارِعَةُ مِنَ الغَنَائِمِ means The surplus<br>\
that is deducted [so I render المُرْتَفِعَةُ الصَّاعِدَةُ,<br>\
app. such things as cannot be divided and are<br>\
therefore removed,] from the main stock of the<br>\
spoils before they are divided into fifths. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And فَوَارِعٌ, (pl. of فَارِعَةٌ, TA,) applied to تِلَاع,<br>\
[a word variously explained, here, I think, used<br>\
as signifying either high, or low, grounds, (see<br>\
its sing. تَلْعَةٌ,)] (S, O, * K, *) means Of which the<br>\
channels wherein the torrents flow are in high, or<br>\
elevated, parts. (S, O, K.)<br>\
فَيْفَرْعٌ (K, TA) and فَيْفَرَعٌ (TA) A species of<br>\
trees. (K, TA.)<br>\
أَفْرَعُ Free from deficiency in the hair [of the<br>\
head]; (S, O, K;) contr. of أَصْلَعُ; (IDrd, S, O,<br>\
K;) used only in this sense; not applied to a man<br>\
who is large in the beard or in the whole head of<br>\
hair: (IDrd, S, O:) the Prophet was أَفْرَع, (S,<br>\
O,) and so was Aboo-Bekr, (O, K,) and &#39;Omar<br>\
was أَصْلَع: (O:) fem. فَرْعَآءُ; (S, O, K;) accord.<br>\
to IDrd, applied to a woman as meaning having<br>\
much hair: (S, O:) pl. فُرْعَانٌ, (O, K,) like its<br>\
contr. صُلْعَانٌ; (O;) and also فُرْعٌ. (K.) &#39;Omar,<br>\
being asked, “Are the صُلْعَان better or the<br>\
فُرْعَان,” said “ The فرعان are better,” meaning<br>\
to assert the superior excellence of Aboo-Bekr<br>\
over himself. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  فَرْعَآءُ الطَّرِيقِ: see فَرْعَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. مُوَسْوِسُ [app. as meaning Such as<br>\
is subject to diabolical promptings or suggestions]:<br>\
so in the trad., لَا يَؤُمَّنَّكُمُ الأَفْرَعُ [The افرع shall by<br>\
no means act as your Imám]. (Nh, K, TA.)<br>\
مُفْرَعٌ Anything tall. (TA.) ―<br>\

makes peace, or effects a reconciliation, between<br>\
them: (TA:) pl. مَفَارِعُ. (S, O, K.)<br>\
