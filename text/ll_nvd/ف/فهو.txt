فَهَوْتُ عَنْهُ, (JK, K,) aor. أَفْهُو, inf. n. فُهُوٌّ,<br>\
(JK,) I was unmindful, forgetful, or neglectful,<br>\
of it. (JK, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ISd says, فَهَا فُؤَادُهُ is like<br>\
هَفَا, [which, said of the heart, accord. to explanations in the TA in art. هفو, means It fluttered,<br>\
or palpitated: and it was flurried by reason of<br>\
grief or of beating:] and no inf. n. of it has been<br>\
heard, therefore I think it to be formed by transposition. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فَهَا signifies also He<br>\
spoke clearly, or distinctly, after doing the contrary thereof. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
فاهاهُ, inf. n. مُفَاهَاةٌ; i. q. فاوههُ, inf. n. مُفَاوَهَةٌ;<br>\
i. e. He talked, or discoursed, with him: and he<br>\
contended with him for superiority in glory, or<br>\
excellence. (TA in art. فوه.)<br>\
4<br>\
افهى He was weak, or erroneous, in his judgment, or opinion. (IAar, K, TA.)<br>\
فَاهٍ, formed by transposition from فَائِهٌ, A man<br>\
who reveals, or discloses, everything that is in his<br>\
mind; like فَاوُوهَةٌ; (Fr, in S and TA, art. فوه;)<br>\
and so فَاهٌ: (Fr, in TA ibid.:) and فَاهٍ بِجُوعِهِ one<br>\
who reveals his hunger. (TA ibid.)<br>\
[<br>\
الافهيانِ, said by Freytag to signify The elephant<br>\
and the buffalo, is a mistranscription for الأَقْهَبَانِ.]<br>\
أَفْهَآءٌ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned]<br>\
i. q. بُلْهٌ [pl. of أَبْلَهُ; signifying Heedless; or<br>\
heedless of evil by reason of their goodness; &amp;c.].<br>\
(IAar, TA.)<br>\
