in the present day; generally having a blade<br>\
more long than wide, and a short handle;<br>\
altogether resembling an adz:] (Kr, M:) and<br>\
with which one cuts; [i. e., an adz; and an axe;<br>\
both also thus called in the present day; more<br>\
commonly the former; used for cutting, cleaving,<br>\
and splitting, trees and wood, (see فَأَسَ,) and for<br>\
hewing, forming, or fashioning, wood &amp;c.: (see<br>\
also قَدُومٌ:)] (M:) a thing well known: (A, K:)<br>\
[applied also to a pickaxe: (see صَاقُورٌ:)] the ء in<br>\
this word may be suppressed: (Msb:) it is of the<br>\
fem. gender: (M, Msb, K:) the pl. (of pauc., O)<br>\

made to press when the rein is drawn hard for<br>\
the purpose of checking the horse]; (IDrd in his<br>\
book on the Saddle and Bridle, [in one part of<br>\
which he likens to it the tongue of a buckle,] S,<br>\

شَكِيمَة; (T;) or, as some say, that which is in<br>\
the middle of the شكيمة, between the مِسْحَلَانِ:<br>\
(ISh:) the شكيمة is the iron that lies across in<br>\
the mouth, [i. e., the bit-mouth, or mouth-piece<br>\
of the bit,] and the مِسْحَل is an iron [i. e. a ring<br>\
of iron, one of a pair of rings which are inserted<br>\
each into the other, in the place of our curbchain,] beneath the حَنَك [here meaning the part<br>\
between the two sides of the lower jaw]: (IDrd:)<br>\
or, as some say, [and among them Kr.] the transverse iron in the bit; (M;) but this assertion requires consideration. (TA.) You say, فُلَانٌ يَلُوكُ<br>\
لِسَانَهُ فِى الكَلَامِ كَمَا يَعْلِكُ الفَرَسُ فَأْسَ اللِّجَامِ<br>\

hinder part of the قمحدوة. (M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  فَأْسُ الرَّحَى<br>\
The [protuberant] part of the [nether, or lower,]<br>\
mill-stone, in the middle of which is [fixed] the<br>\

And hence, الفَأْسُ The Constellation of Ursa<br>\
Minor. (Idem, same place.) ―<br>\
-b6-  فَأْسُ الفَمِ The<br>\
extremity of the mouth, in which are the teeth.<br>\
