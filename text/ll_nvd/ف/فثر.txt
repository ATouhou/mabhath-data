K;) thus it means with the vulgar: (L:) or a<br>\
طَسْت of gold, or of silver: (O:) or the طَسْتَخَان,<br>\
(T, K,) or طَشْتَخَان, (O, and so in some copies<br>\
of the K,) [i. e. a large circular tray, of brass or<br>\
other metal, which serves as a table for food, being<br>\
generally placed upon a stool, the persons who<br>\
eat sitting on the floor]; (Lth, T, Z, O, K;)<br>\
thus it means with the vulgar: (Lth, T, Z, O:)<br>\
or a خِوَان [or table upon which food is eaten],<br>\
made of marble, (Lth, T, S, M, O, K,) by the<br>\
people of Syria, who thus call it, (Lth, T, O,) or<br>\
of silver, (T, S, M,) and the like, (S,) or of gold:<br>\
(M, K:) or of any kind accord. to some: (TA:)<br>\
or a جَام [q. v.] of silver, (T, Nh, TA,) or of gold:<br>\
(Nh, TA:) [but this seems to be virtually a repetition; for it is said that] ↓ فَاثُورِيَّةٌ, occurring in<br>\
a verse of Lebeed, means أَخْوِنَةٌ [pl. of pauc. of<br>\
خِوَانٌ] (T, O) and جَامَاتٌ [which is pl. of جَامٌ<br>\
accord. to IAar, or of جَامَةٌ accord. to IB, who<br>\
holds جَامٌ to be likewise a pl. of جَامَةٌ]: (T:)<br>\
فَاثُورٌ is a word of the people of Syria and ElJezeereh: (M:) and it signifies (S, O, L) in the<br>\
dial. of the people of El-Jezeereh, (L,) a مَائِدَة<br>\
[sometimes meaning table in an absolute sense,<br>\
but properly one with food upon it]: (S, O, L:)<br>\
[hence,] one says, هُمْ عَلَى فَاثُورٍ وَاحِدٍ (Lth, T, S,<br>\
M, O, L, TA) i. e. عَلَى مَائِدَةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ, (S, O, L,<br>\
TA,) and مَنْزِلَةٍ وَاحِدَةٍ, (S, O, TA,) and بَسَاطٍ<br>\
وَاحِدٍ, (O, TA, [in both of which the former word<br>\
is without any vowel-sign to the ب so that it<br>\
may be either بَسَاطٍ or بِسَاطٍ,]) or بَسْطٍ واحدٍ, (TT<br>\
as from the M,) or as though meaning على بساطٍ<br>\
واحدٍ, thus expl. by Lth, as said of the people of<br>\
Syria and El-Jezeereh: (TT as from the T:) [it<br>\
means, app., They are living upon one kind of<br>\
fare; upon one footing; upon one level or stratum:]<br>\
in the copies of the K, [or in the generality of the<br>\
copies thereof,] الفَاثُورُ is expl. as signifying المَنْزِلَةُ<br>\
and النَّشَاطُ; but النشاط is a mistake for البساط.<br>\
(TA. [My MS. copy of the K has the right<br>\
reading (البساط), without any trace of alteration.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  The breast, or bosom: (K:) or a wide<br>\
