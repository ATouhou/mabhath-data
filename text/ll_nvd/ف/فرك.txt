becomes stripped off (O, TA) from its kernel; as,<br>\
for instance, a [shelled] walnut. (TA.) One says,<br>\
فَرَكَ السُّنْبُلَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
فَرُكَ, inf. n. فَرْكٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb,) He rubbed, or rubbed and pressed, the<br>\

Msb, TA.) And فَرَكَ الثَّوْبَ (S, O, Msb, K) He<br>\
rubbed, or rubbed and pressed, the garment (K,<br>\

Msb,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (Mgh,) He<br>\
rubbed, (Msb,) or rubbed and pressed, (Mgh,)<br>\
with his hand, the [dry soil of] sperma, so that it<br>\
crumbled, and came off from the garment; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) like حَتَّهُ: and in like manner الطِّينَ [i. e.<br>\

rubbed, or rubbed and pressed, the louse, between<br>\

-A2-  فَرِكَتْ زَوْجَهَا, and<br>\
فَرِكَهَا زَوْجُهَا, aor.<br>\
فَرَكَ; (S, O, K;) and فَرَكَتْهُ, and<br>\

(K;) inf. n. فِرْكٌ (S, O, K) and فَرْكٌ and فُرُوكٌ;<br>\
(K;) She hated her husband, and her husband<br>\
hated her; (S, O;) or she hated her husband<br>\
vehemently, and her husband hated her vehemently:<br>\
(K:) the verb has not been heard otherwise than<br>\
as relating to the husband and wife: (S, O:) Lh<br>\
has mentioned فَرَكَتْهُ, aor. تَفْرُكُهُ; but it is not<br>\
well known: (TA:) all of the nouns mentioned<br>\
above as inf. ns. signify [hatred, or] vehement<br>\
hatred, in a general sense, as also ↓ فُرُكَّانٌ, (K,<br>\
TA,) which is [app. a simple subst.] mentioned<br>\
on the authority of Seer, and also mentioned as<br>\
with two kesrehs and the teshdeed [i. e. ↓ فِرِكَّانٌ]:<br>\
(TA:) or all relate peculiarly to the hatred of the<br>\
husband and wife; (K, TA;) i. e., to the man&#39;s<br>\
hating his wife; or to her hating him, which is<br>\
the better known: it is said in a trad. of Ibn-Mes&#39;ood, إِنَّ الحُبَّ مِنَ اللّٰهِ وَالفِرْكَ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ<br>\
[Verily love of the husband is from God, and<br>\
hatred of the husband is from the Devil]:<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd says that الفِرْكُ signifies the woman&#39;s<br>\
hating her husband; that it relates peculiarly to<br>\
the wife and the husband, and that it had not<br>\
been heard by him as used in relation to any but<br>\
them two: and IAar says that the sons of a man<br>\
by a wife who hates him, which sons are termed<br>\
أَوْلَادُ الفِرْكِ, possess generosity, because the sons<br>\
thus called are most like to their fathers, and do<br>\
not resemble her: and when the husband hates<br>\
the wife, one says صلفها [i. e. صَلَفَهَا or صَلِفَهَا] and<br>\
صلفت عنده [i. e. صَلِفَتْ عِنْدَهُ]. (TA.)<br>\

i. e. in the state in which they were fit to be<br>\
rubbed, or rubbed and pressed, with the hand [so<br>\
as to divest the kernels of their husks], and then to<br>\

الحَبُّ, (K,) The seed-produce, and the grain,<br>\
attained to the state in which it was fit to be<br>\
rubbed, or rubbed and pressed, (K, TA,) with the<br>\
