and فِسَّاطٌ and فُسْتَاطٌ and فِسْتَاطٌ, (S, M, K,) the<br>\
ت in the last two, as it is not found in the pl.,<br>\
being a substitute for the [former] ط in فسطاط,<br>\
or rather for the [latter] س in فسّاط, because it<br>\
is more regular to change the latter of two identical letters than to change the former, and because the two identical letters in فسّاط are together,<br>\
whereas the two identical letters in فسطاط are<br>\
separated, (M,) and فُسْتَاتٌ and فِسْتَاتٌ, (K,)<br>\
altogether eight different forms, but MF observes<br>\
that Esh-Shiháb El-Kastalánee gives twelve,<br>\
[which, however, he does not transcribe, the<br>\
remaining four being probably with fet-h to the<br>\
ف,] (TA,) A tent of hair [-cloth]: (S, Msb:) or<br>\
a great tent: (Mgh:) or a kind of structure (M,<br>\
Z) used in travelling, less than the سُرَادِق: (Z:)<br>\
or the kind of structure called سُرَادِق: (K:) pl.<br>\
فَسَاطِيطُ; (M, Msb, TA;) for which they did not<br>\
say فَسَاتِيطُ. (M, TA:) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence فُسْطَاطٌ is applied<br>\
to A city: (Z, TA:) any city: and particularly<br>\
a city in which is the general place of assemblage<br>\
of people: (TA:) a populous, or comprehensive,<br>\
city; accord. to some: (Msb:) the place of assemblage of the people of a كُورَة [which means a city,<br>\
and a district, or region], (Lth, Az, K,) around<br>\
their general mosque: (Az, TA:) or you say,<br>\
فُسْطَاطُ المِصْرِ, meaning the place of assemblage of<br>\
the people of the مصر [or city], around their congregational mosque. (M.) فُسْطَاطُ [so in two copies<br>\
of the S] is [a name of] The city of مِصْر [the<br>\
metropolis of Egypt]: (S:) or الفُسْطَاطُ is also the<br>\
proper name of مِصْرُالعَتِيقَةُ, (K, TA,) the city so<br>\
called, (TA,) which was built by &#39;Amr Ibn-El-<br>\
&#39;Ás; (K, TA;) the city of مصر in old times; as<br>\
also الفِسْطَاطُ: (Msb:) and البَصْرَةُ. (TA.)<br>\
