(TA:) and of sweat, meaning It exuded; and so<br>\
فَصَّ. (TA in art. فص.)<br>\

8<br>\
افتزّ He (a man, O) overcame; (K;) or<br>\

استفزّهُ It (fear, S, A, O) excited him to<br>\
lightness and unsteadiness; unsettled him. (S, A,<br>\
O, K.) وَاسْتَفْزِزْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعتَ مِنْهُمْ بِصَوْتِكَ, in the<br>\
Kur [xvii. 66], is expl. by Fr as meaning And<br>\
excite thou to lightness and unsteadiness, or unsettle<br>\
thou, when thou canst, with thy voice. (O, TA.)<br>\
And in like manner, وَإِنْ كَادُوا لَيَسْتَفِزُّونَكَ مِنَ<br>\
الأَرْضِ, in the same [xvii. 78], is expl. by him (O,<br>\
TA) as meaning, And verily they were near to<br>\
unsettling thee from the land: (TA:) but some<br>\
say the meaning is, they were near to frightening<br>\
thee so as to excite thee to promptness of flight<br>\
from the land. (O, TA.) And استفزّهُ عَنْ رَأْيِهِ<br>\
He incited him, or excited him, to ignorance,<br>\
foolishness, or wrong conduct, and levity, or unsteadiness, so as to make him swerve from his right<br>\
sentiment, opinion, or judgment; like اِسْتَخَفَّهُ عن<br>\
رأيه. (Az and TA in art. خف.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He incited<br>\
him, or excited him, to be promptly obedient and<br>\
submissive to him and to that which he desired of<br>\
him; like استخفّهُ. (Ksh in xliii. 54.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He<br>\
expelled him (Jel in xvii. 105, and K) from the<br>\
land, (Jel,) or from his abode, and disturbed, or<br>\
disquieted, or unsettled, him, (K,) so as to excite<br>\
him to lightness and unsteadiness. (TA.) [See<br>\

-b4-  He, or it, deceived him, or<br>\
beguiled him, so as to cast him into destruction.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\

some in the Kur xvii. 78, quoted above. (TA.)<br>\
فَزٌّ A light, or an active, man. (S, A, O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And The offspring of the cow; (S;) [meaning,] of the wild cow: (O, K:) because of its<br>\
restlessness: (TA:) pl. أَفْزَازٌ. (S, O, K.)<br>\
فَزَّةٌ A leap with disquietude [or fright]. (TA.)<br>\
قَعَدَ مُسْتَفَزًّا [so in a copy of the S, but without<br>\
the vowel-signs: in two other copies of the same,<br>\
مُسْتَوْفِزًا, which belongs to art. وفز:] He sat in an<br>\
uneasy posture. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  فَرَسٌ مُسْتَفِزٌّ لِلْوَثْبِ وَالعَدْوِ<br>\
[so in two copies of the S, in art. طمر; in the O,<br>\
in that art., مُسْتَفِزُّ الوَثْبِ وَالعَدْوِ; probably a<br>\
mistake for مُسْتَفَزّ; app. meaning, A horse in a<br>\
state of excitement to leap and run.]<br>\
