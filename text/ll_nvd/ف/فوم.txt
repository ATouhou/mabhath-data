فَوَّمْتُ الخُبْزَ I made bread, or the bread.<br>\
(IJ, M.) [And] فَوِّمُوا لَنَا Make ye bread for us:<br>\
(T, S:) a phrase said by Fr to have been heard<br>\
from the Arabs as meaning thus. (T.)<br>\
فُومٌ, a word occurring in the Kur ii. 58, (T,<br>\
S, M, &amp;c.,) is expl. as signifying the same as ثُومٌ<br>\
[which generally means Garlic; but is said to<br>\
have also the meaning here next following]; (T,<br>\
S, M, Msb, K;) said to be a dial. var. of the<br>\
latter word, but app. [if meaning “ garlic ”]<br>\
formed, as IJ says, by the substitution of ف for<br>\
ث; (M;) and &#39;Abd-Allah [Ibn-Mes&#39;ood] read<br>\
[in the Kur ubi suprà] وَثُومِهَا [instead of وَفُومِهَا]:<br>\
(Fr, T, S:) it is also expl. as signifying wheat;<br>\
(T, S, M, Msb, K;) which is said by Lh to be a<br>\
meaning of ثُوم and فُوم; and if Ibn-Mes&#39;ood<br>\
read the word as ثوم, the meaning is فوم, i. e.<br>\
“ wheat; ” (T;) accord. to Fr, it is an old word,<br>\
signifying thus, (T, S, *) and also bread; (T, S,<br>\
K;) Zj says that there is no difference of state-<br>\
ment among the lexicologists as to its having the<br>\
former of these two meanings, that it is said to<br>\
have the latter also, and that it also signifies the<br>\
other grains, beside wheat, whereof bread is made<br>\
[which last meaning is also mentioned in the K];<br>\
(T;) and IJ holds that it is rightly expl. as<br>\
having the first of these three meanings (i. e.<br>\
“ wheat ”) and the last of them: (M:) another<br>\
meaning assigned to it is حِمَّصٌ [i. e. cicer arietinum; or chick-peas]; (S, K;) which is of the<br>\
dial. of Syria: (S:) and it signifies also any عُقْدَة<br>\
[app. meaning head of a plant, such as that] of an<br>\
onion, or of a garlic: or a great gobbet of food:<br>\
(K: [for أَوْ لُقْمَةٍ عَظِيمَةٍ in the CK, I read او لُقْمَةٌ<br>\
عَظِيمَةٌ as in other copies of the K:]) in the dial.<br>\
of Azd-es-Saráh, it is applied to ears of corn;<br>\
and ↓ فُومَةٌ is its n. un.; (M;) this latter signifying an ear of corn, (S, K, TA,) as expl. by IDrd:<br>\
(TA:) فُومٌ has فُومَانٌ [of the measure فُعْلَنَانٌ] for<br>\
a pl., this being [virtually] a pl. pl.; mentioned<br>\
by IJ, who says that the dammeh in فُومٌ is different from the dammeh in فُومَانٌ. (M, TA.)<br>\
فُومَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, near<br>\
the end. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A thing that one carries between<br>\
his two fingers. (K.)<br>\
قَطَعُوا الشَّاةَ فُوَمًا فُوَمًا (M, K, *) means [They cut<br>\
the sheep, or goat,] into a number of pieces; (M;)<br>\
like فُؤَمًا. (K.)<br>\
فَامِىٌّ, altered from فُومِىٌّ, A seller of فُوم [app. 3].<br>\
in any of its senses, but accord. to the TA as<br>\
meaning wheat, or chick-peas]: (S, K:) [or] a<br>\
seller of fruit: (MA:) accord. to Az, (TA,)<br>\
الفَامِىُّ means السُّكَّرِىُّ, (Mgh, TA,) who is called<br>\
by the vulgar البَيَّاعُ [generally signifying the<br>\
seller, or vender; perhaps here meaning the seller<br>\
of sugar, though I do not anywhere find السُّكَّرِىُّ<br>\
thus explained]; (Mgh;) but he says, “I do<br>\
not think it genuine Arabic. ” (TA.)<br>\
