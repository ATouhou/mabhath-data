فَاصَ فِى الأَرْضِ, aor. يَفِيصُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n.<br>\
فَيْصٌ, (TA,) He went away into the country, or<br>\
in the land. (S, O, K.) In the following verse<br>\
of Imra-el-Keys,<br>\
مَنَابِتُهُ مِثْلُ السُّدُوسِ وَلَوْنُهُ<br>\
كَشَوْكِ السَّيَالِ فَهْوَ عَذْبٌ يَفِيصُ<br>\
respecting which As said, I know not what is<br>\
[the meaning of] يَفِيضُ, this word is said to be<br>\
from فاص signifying as expl. above: (S, O:)<br>\
[but I do not see what meaning that would be<br>\
apposite in this case could be thence derived<br>\
without straining:] but فاص signifies also it<br>\
shone, or glistened; syn. بَرَقَ; (TA;) and some<br>\
say that يفيص in this verse means يَبْرُقُ; (O,<br>\
TA;) and the pronoun in مَنَابِتُهُ relates to the<br>\
front teeth; (O, * TA;) by عَذْبٌ يَفِيضُ being<br>\
meant the lustre (مَآء) thereof: (O:) [accordingly,<br>\
the verse may be rendered, The places of growth<br>\
thereof, i. e. their gums, were like the (garment<br>\
called) سُدُوس, and their colour was like the<br>\
thorns of the سَيَال (q. v.), so that they were sweet<br>\
and glistening: (see the context in “ the Divans<br>\
of the six ancient Arabic poets,” edited by Prof.<br>\
Ahlwardt:) or, as some relate the verse, the last<br>\
word is ↓ يُفِيصُ, (IB, O, TA,) from مَا أَفَاصَ<br>\
بِكَلِمَةٍ [q. v.], (O,) so that it is a denotative of<br>\
state, the meaning being عَذْبٌ فِي حَالِ كَلَامِهِ<br>\
[i. e. sweet when [displayed in] speaking; or<br>\
rather, clearly uttering; but it will be seen below<br>\
that يَفِيصُ, as well as يُفِيصُ, may, accord. to the<br>\
M and K, be used in this sense:] (IB, TA:) see<br>\
4. ―<br>\
-b2-  مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ أَنْ أَفِيصَ مِنْهُ, meaning I was<br>\
not able to turn aside, or away, from, or to avoid,<br>\
him, or it. (S, O.) [See also مَفِيصٌ: and see 4.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And وَاللّٰه مَا فِصْتُ, like as one says واللّٰه ما<br>\
بَرِحْتُ [perhaps meaning By God I did not<br>\
quit my place; as well as I did not cease:]<br>\
(S, O, K: *) mentioned on the authority of<br>\
AHeyth: (TA:) [that it has the latter meaning<br>\
is clear; for] one says, مَا فِصْتُ أَفْعَلُ I did not<br>\
cease (مَا بَرِحْتُ) doing [such a thing]: (M:) and<br>\
↓ استفاص, likewise, signifies بَرِحَ. (IB, TA.)<br>\

فَاْيَصَ see 3 in art. فوص.<br>\
4<br>\
افاص الضَّبُّ عَنْ يَدِهِ [The lizard called ضبّ<br>\
escaped, or slipped, from his hand, is expl. as<br>\
meaning] his fingers became unclosed (اِنْفَرَجَت)<br>\
from [the grasp of] the ضبّ, so that it escaped<br>\
from him. (M, TA.) And one says, قَبَضْتُ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ فَلَمْ يُفِصْ I grasped him and he did not<br>\
escape, or get loose. (AHeyth, TA.) And قَبَضْتُ<br>\
عَلَى ذَنَبِ الضَّبِّ فَأَفَاصَ مِنْ يَدِى حَتَّى خَلَّصَ ذَنَبَهُ<br>\
[I grasped the tail of the ضبّ and it slipped from<br>\
my hand so that it freed its tail]: (Lth, S, O, TA:)<br>\
[but in the O, مِنْ is omitted before يَدِى; not<br>\
intentionally, for the verb before من is there<br>\
masc., as above:]) this is when thy fingers<br>\
become unclosed (تَتَفَرَّجُ) from the grasp of its<br>\
tail: (Lth, O:) and this [state of the fingers] is<br>\
termed ↓ التَّفَاوُصُ. (TA.) [It is also said that]<br>\
أَفَاصَتِ اليَدُ signifies The fingers of the hand<br>\
became unclosed (تَفَرَّجَتْ) from the grasp of the<br>\
thing. (K, TA. [But I doubt the correctness of<br>\
this.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And الإِفَاصَةُ signifies The being clear,<br>\
or perspicuous; syn. البَيَانُ; (O, K;) like<br>\
المُفَاوَصَةُ, expl. in art. فوص;] and the being<br>\
fluent. (O.) [And also The making speech<br>\
clear, or perspicuous.] One says, فُلَانٌ ذُو إِفَاصَةٍ<br>\
إِذَا تَكَلَّمَ Such a one is a person endowed with<br>\
clearness, or perspicuity, and fluency, when he<br>\
speaks. (O.) And افاص لِسَانُهُ بِالكَلَامِ His<br>\
tongue made speech, or the speech, clear, or perspicuous; and so ↓ فَاصَ, aor. يَفِيصُ; (M;) and<br>\
مَا يَفِيصُ بِهِ لِسَانُهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. فَيْصٌ, (TA,)<br>\
his tongue does not make it clear, or perspicuous<br>\
(K, TA.) And مَا أَفَاصَ بِكَلِمَةٍ He did not make<br>\
clear, or distinct, or perspicuous, a word, or a sentence. (Yaakoob, S, O, TA.) See also 4 in art.<br>\
فوص: and see 1 in the present art. [And it is<br>\
said that مَا أَفَاضَ بِكَلِمَةٍ signifies the same. Or,<br>\
accord. to Mtr, if he be correctly cited in Har<br>\
p. 447, the verb in this sense, and app. as thus<br>\
used in all the phrases mentioned above, is correctly with ض, and not so with ص: but this I<br>\
greatly doubt.] ―<br>\
-b3-  One says also, افاص بِبَوْلِهِ He<br>\
ejected his urine: (O, K:) or افاض به. (ElGhooree, in Har ubi suprà.)<br>\
6<br>\
التَّفَايُصُ is said to be the original and regular form of التَّفَاوُصُ, which signifies The speaking,<br>\
talking, or discoursing, each to another, or each<br>\
with another: the ى being changed into و because of the dammeh. (M in this art. and in art.<br>\
فوص, and TA.) ―<br>\

مَا عَنْهُ مَفِيصٌ There is not any place to which<br>\
to turn aside, or away, from it: or there is not<br>\
any turning aside, or away, from it: syn. مَحِيدٌ<br>\
[which may be meant either as a n. of place<br>\
or as an inf. n.]: (As, S, O, K:) or مَعْدِلٌ.<br>\
