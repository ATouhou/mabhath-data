فَطُرَ, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. فُطُورٌ: (Msb, TA:) his fast became vitiated.<br>\
(Msb.) افطر as quasi-pass. of فَطَّرْتُهُ is extr., (Sb,)<br>\
like أَبْشَرَ as quasi-pass. of بَشَّرْتُهُ. (Sb, Mgh.) You<br>\
say افطر عَلَى تَمْرٍ [He breakfasted upon dates, or<br>\
dried dates;] he made dates, or dried dates, his<br>\
breakfast, after sunset [in Ramadán]. (Msb.)<br>\

of morning ” and “ upon the time of evening: ”<br>\
(Mgh, * Msb:) or he became in the predicament<br>\
of those who break their fast, and so though he<br>\
neither ate nor drank: whence the trad., أَفْطَرَ<br>\
الحَاجِمُ وَالْمَحْجُومُ The cupper and the cupped<br>\
place themselves in the predicament of those who<br>\
break their fast: or it is time for the cupper and<br>\
the cupped to break their fast: or it is used after<br>\
the manner of a harsh expression, and an imprecation against them. (IAth.)<br>\

قَدَمَاهُ ↓ تَفَطَّرَتْ His feet became cracked: [or<br>\
much cracked.] (TA, from a trad.) And ↓ تَفَطَّرَتِ<br>\
الأَرْضُ بِالنَّبَاتِ The earth became cracked [in many<br>\

occurring in the saying هَلْ تَرَى مِنْ فُطُورٍ [Dost<br>\
thou see any clefts?], in the Kur [lxvii. 3]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  &#39;Omar, being asked respecting [the discharge<br>\
termed] المَذْى, answered, It is الفَطْرُ: (O, K:)<br>\
thus as related by A &#39;Obeyd: (TA:) it is said<br>\
that he likened it, in respect of its paucity, to<br>\
what is drawn from the udder by means of the<br>\
milking termed الفَطْرُ: (O, K:) or, as some say,<br>\
it is from تَفَطَّرَتْ قَدَمَاهُ دَمًا [expl. above]: (TA:)<br>\
or he likened its coming forth from the orifice of<br>\
the ذَكَر to the coming forth of the نَاب of the<br>\
camel: or, as it is related by En-Nadr, he said<br>\
↓ الفُطْرُ, with damm: meaning the milk that<br>\
appears upon the orifice of the teat of the udder.<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\
فُطْرٌ Such as has broken forth [with buds or<br>\
leaves] (مَا تَفَطَّرَ), of plants. (TA.) See also فِطْرٌ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And, (S, K,) as also ↓ فُطُرٌ, (K,) the latter<br>\
used in poetry, (TA,) [The toadstool;] a species<br>\
of كَمْأَة [or fungus], (S, K,) white and large, (S,)<br>\
and deadly: (K:) [so called] because the ground<br>\
cleaves asunder from it: (TA:) n. un. فُطْرَةٌ. (S.)<br>\
[Also applied in the present day to The common<br>\
mushroom; agariens campestris. And Any fungus.]<br>\
-A2-  [Also, the former, Immaturity, or want<br>\
of leaven, in dough:] see the explanation of فَطَرَتِ<br>\
المَرْأَةُ العَجِينَ.<br>\
-A3-  And فُطْرٌ and ↓ فُطُرٌ signify also<br>\
Somewhat of that which remains of milk [in the<br>\
udder], which is then milked: (L, K:) or a small<br>\
quantity of milk when it is milked: (TA:) or milk<br>\
at the time when it is milked. (AA, TA.) See<br>\
also فَطْرٌ, last sentence.<br>\
فِطْرٌ Grapes when the heads thereof appear;<br>\
(K, TA;) [so called] because the [fruit-] stalks<br>\
[then] break forth (تَنْفَطِرُ); (TA;) as also ↓ فُطْرٌ.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also a subst. from أَفْطَرَ; (S;) [as<br>\
such] it signifies The breaking of a fast; contr. of<br>\
صَوْمٌ. (TA.) [Hence, عِيدُ الفِطْرِ The festival of<br>\
the breaking of the fast, immediately after Rama-<br>\
dán; sometimes called الفِطْرُ alone.] ↓ الفِطْرَةُ<br>\
means صَدَقَةُ الفِطْرِ [The alms of the breaking of<br>\
the fast], (O, K, TA,) which is a صَاع [q. v.] of<br>\
wheat: the prefixed noun (صدقه) is rejected,<br>\
and ة is affixed to its complement (الفطر) to<br>\
indicate that such has been done: but it is a<br>\
word used by the lawyers; not of the classical<br>\
language. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also مُفْطِرٌ.<br>\
فُطُرٌ: see فُطْرٌ, in two places.<br>\
فِطْرَةٌ Creation: (Msb:) the causing a thing to<br>\
exist, producing it, or bringing it into existence,<br>\
newly, for the first time; originating it. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  The natural constitution with which a child is<br>\
created in his mother&#39;s womb; (AHeyth, K;) i. q.<br>\
خِلْقَةٌ. (S, Mgh.) It is said to have this signification in the Kur xxx. 29. (TA.) And so in<br>\
the saying of Mohammad, كُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى<br>\
الفِطْرَةِ Every infant is born in a state of conformity to the natural constitution with which he is<br>\
created in his mother&#39;s womb, either prosperous or<br>\
unprosperous [in relation to the soul]; and if his<br>\
parents are Jews, they make him a Jew, with<br>\
respect to his worldly predicament; [i. e., with<br>\
respect to inheritances &amp;c.;] and if Christians,<br>\
they make him a Christian, with respect to that<br>\
predicament; and if Magians, they make him a<br>\
Magian, with respect to that predicament; his<br>\
predicament is the same as that of his parents<br>\
until his tongue speaks for him: but if he die<br>\
before his attaining to the age when virility begins<br>\
to show itself, he dies in a state of conformity to<br>\
his preceding natural constitution, with which he<br>\
was created in his mother&#39;s womb. (AHeyth,<br>\
TA.) [See another explanation of the word, as<br>\
occurring in this trad., below.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Nature; constitution; or natural, native, innate, or original,<br>\
disposition, or temper or other quality or property;<br>\
idiosyncrasy. (Th, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The faculty of knowing God, with which He has created mankind:<br>\
(TA:) the natural constitution with which a child<br>\
is created in his mother&#39;s womb, whereby he is<br>\
capable of accepting the religion of truth: this is<br>\
a secondary application: and this is [said to be]<br>\
the signification meant in the trad. mentioned<br>\
above. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Hence, The religion of el-Islám: (Mgh:) the profession whereby a man<br>\
becomes a Muslim, which is the declaration that<br>\
there is no deity but God, and that Mohammad<br>\
is his servant and his apostle, who brought the<br>\
truth from Him, and this is (AHeyth, TA) religion. (AHeyth, K, TA.) This is shown by a<br>\
trad., in which it is related that Mohammad<br>\
taught a man to repeat certain words when lying<br>\
down to sleep, and said فَإِنَّكَ إِنْ مُتَّ مِنْ لَيْلَتِكَ<br>\
مُتَّ عَلَى الفِطْرَةِ [And then, if thou die that same<br>\
night, thou diest in the profession of the true religion]. (AHeyth, TA.) Also by the saying, قَصُّ<br>\
الأَظْفَارِ مِنَ الفِطْرَةِ The paring of the nails is [a<br>\
point] of the religion of el-Islám. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also<br>\
i. q. سُنَّةٌ [app. meaning The way, course, mode, or<br>\
manner, of acting, or conduct, or the like, pursued,<br>\
and prescribed to be followed, by Mohammad].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  In the Kur xxx. 29, accord. to some,<br>\
The covenant received, or accepted, from Adam<br>\
and his posterity. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b8-  The pl. is فِطَرَاتٌ and<br>\
فِطْرَاتٌ and فِطِرَاتٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also فِطْرٌ.<br>\
الإِيمَانُ الفِطْرِىُّ [The faith to which one is disposed by the natural constitution with which he is<br>\
created]. (Msb.)<br>\
فُطَارٌ A sword having in it cracks; (S, Z, O,<br>\
K;) and (K) that will not cut: (IAar, O, K:)<br>\
or recently made. (TA.)<br>\
فَطُورٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ فَطُورِىٌّ, (S, K,) as<br>\
though the latter were a rel. n. from the former,<br>\
(S,) A breakfast; a thing [i. e. food or beverage]<br>\
upon which one breaks his fast. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
فَطِيرٌ Dough unleavened; or not left until it has<br>\
become good [or mature]; contr. of خَمِيرٌ: (S,<br>\
TA:) and in like manner clay, or mud. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence,] عِيدُ الفَطِيرِ [The feast of unleavened<br>\
bread; also called, of the Passover;] a festival<br>\
of the Jews, [commencing] on the fifteenth day of<br>\
their month نِيسَان, and lasting seven days. (Msb.<br>\
[See also الفِصْحُ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Anything prepared, made,<br>\
or done, hastily, or hurried, so as to prevent its<br>\
becoming mature: (Lth, S, K:) fresh; recent;<br>\
newly made: (S, TA:) pl. فَطْرَى: (Sgh, IAth,<br>\
TA:) for أَطْعَمَهُ فَطْرَى, in the K, expl. as meaning [He fed him] with فَطِير, is a gross mistake, a<br>\
mistranscription of أَطْعِمَةٌ فَطْرَى, as the phrase<br>\
stands in the handwriting of Sgh himself, in wellformed letters, and with the syll. signs, meaning<br>\
meats [newly prepared, &amp;c.]. (TA.) You say<br>\
عِنْدِى خُبْزٌ خَمِيرٌ وَحَيْسٌ فَطِيرٌ [I have leavened<br>\
bread, and] fresh, recent, or newly made, حيس<br>\
[q. v.]. (S, TA.) You say also إِيَّاكَ وَالرَّأْىَ الفَطِيرُ<br>\
(tropical:)  Beware thou of a hastily formed, immature,<br>\
opinion. (S.) And شَرُّ الرَّأْىِ الفَطِيرُ (tropical:)  [The worst<br>\
opinion is the hastily formed, and immature].<br>\

-b3-  A skin not saturated with the tanning<br>\
liquid: or not put therein: (TA:) a whip not<br>\

slaughtered on the day of [the festival of] the<br>\
فِطْر: (K, TA:) mentioned by Sgh, and in the<br>\

(IAar, O, K, * TA;) such as is termed فَدْم [impotent in speech or actions, heavy, or dull; &amp;c.]:<br>\

تَفَاطِيرُ, a word similar to تَعَاشِيبُ and تَعَاجِيبُ<br>\
and تَبَاشِيرُ [q. v.], none of which four words has<br>\
a sing., Pimples that come forth in the face of a<br>\
boy or young man, and of a girl or young woman;<br>\
as also ↓ نَفَاطِيرُ: thus correctly, with ت and ن:<br>\
the author of the K, following Sgh [in the O],<br>\
says that ↓ أَفَاطِيرُ is the pl. of ↓ أُفْطُورٌ, and signifies<br>\
a cracking, or chapping, in the nose of a young<br>\
man, and in his face. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, thus correctly, with ت, The first of [the herbage of the<br>\
rain called] the وَسْمِىّ [q. v.]; and in this sense<br>\
also it has no sing.: but it is said in the K that<br>\
↓ نَفَاطِيرُ is pl. of ↓ نُفْطُورَةٌ, with ن; [in the O,<br>\
that it is pl. of ↓ نُفْطُورٌ;] and [in both] that it<br>\
signifies scattered herbage; (TA;) and Lh says,<br>\
as is stated by AHn, that مِنْ عُشْبٍ ↓ نَفَاطِيرُ<br>\
means small quantities of herbage in land: (O,<br>\
TA:) it is also added in the K, in explanation of<br>\
↓ نَفَاطِيرُ, or it signifies the first herbage of [the<br>\
rain called] the وَسْمِىّ: (TA:) [and it is said<br>\
that] تَفَاطِيرُ نَبَاتٍ signifies what break forth of,<br>\

↓ فِطْرٌ signifies the same, as sing. and pl., (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) being originally an inf. n. (S, Msb.)<br>\
مُنْفَطِرٌ is used in the Kur [lxxiii. 18], in the<br>\
phrase السَّمَآءُ مُنْفَطِرٌ بِهِ [The heaven shall be with<br>\
