فَرَضَهُ, (S, A, O, Msb, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
فَرِضَ, (Msb,<br>\
TA, &amp;c.,) inf. n. فَرْضٌ, (S, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) He<br>\
made a mark in it, or upon it, by notching, or<br>\
otherwise: (O:) he notched it: made a notch, or<br>\
an incision, in it; (S, O, Msb, K;) namely, a<br>\
piece of wood, (Msb,) a زَنْد, [or rather فَرَضَهَا<br>\
said of a زَنْدَة, from which fire is produced,] and<br>\
a سِوَاك [or toothstick], (S, O,) and in like manner<br>\
a bow; (A;) as also [↓ افترضهُ; (see this verb<br>\
below;) and] ↓ فرّضهُ, inf. n. تَفْرِيضٌ: (K:) or<br>\
this last signifies he notched it much; or made<br>\
notches in it; (S, O, TA;) or you say, فَرَضَ قَوْسَهُ<br>\
and فَرَّضَ قِسِيَّهُ: (A:) and فَرَضَهُ signifies he notched<br>\
it with his teeth; namely, a tooth-stick: (As:) and<br>\
he cut it; namely, a thing; or a hard thing;<br>\
which is said by some to be the primary signification: (TA:) and he (a tailor) cut it out;<br>\
namely a garment: (Kull p. 275:) and he cut it<br>\
out and made it round; namely a shield: (TA:)<br>\
and فَرْضٌ also signifies the cutting, or dividing,<br>\
lengthwise; cleaving; or the like; applied in a<br>\
general manner; or the making a trench, or an<br>\
oblong excavation, in the middle of a grave;<br>\
فَرَضْتُ لِلْمَيِّتِ signifying I made a trench, or an<br>\
oblong excavation, in the middle of a grave, for<br>\
the corpse. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  فَرَضَ لَهُ, [aor. and] inf. n.<br>\
as above, (K, &amp;c.,) He apportioned to him [a<br>\
thing]: he appointed to him [a thing]: (Bd in<br>\
xxxiii. 38, and TA: *) because that which is<br>\
apportioned, or appointed, [to a person] is cut<br>\
off from the thing from which it is apportioned,<br>\
or appointed: (TA:) he made [a thing] lawful,<br>\
or allowable, to him; (Jel in xxxiii. 38, and<br>\
Kull in p. 275, and TA; *) relating to a case into<br>\
which a man has brought himself: (Kull:) this<br>\
is said to be the meaning when the phrase فَرَضَ<br>\
اللّٰهُ لَهُ occurs in the Kur: (TA:) he appointed,<br>\
or assigned, to him a definite portion; (K;) as<br>\
also له ↓ افرض. (O, L, K.) You say فَرَضَ لَهُ فِى<br>\
العَطَآءِ [He appointed, or assigned, to him a definite portion in the gift]. (As, S.) And فَرَضَ<br>\
لَهُ فِى الدِّيوَانِ (As, S, A) [He appointed, or<br>\
assigned, to him a definite portion in the register<br>\
of soldiers or pensioners; or] he registered his<br>\
stipend therein. (As, A, TA.) And فَرَضَهُ, (S,)<br>\
and ↓ افرضهُ, (S, K,) He gave to him. (S, O, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  فَرَضَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb,) aor. as above, (TA,)<br>\
and so the inf. n., (Msb, TA,) also signifies He<br>\
(God, S, A, Mgh, Msb) made a thing, (S, TA,)<br>\
or prayer, (A, Mgh,) or statutes or ordinances,<br>\
(Msb,) obligatory, or binding, syn. أَوْجَبَ, (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, TA,) by a known decree, (TA,) [or<br>\
He imposed a thing &amp;c.,] عَلَى إِنْسَانٍ on a man,<br>\
(TA,) or عَلَيْنَا on us; (S;) and so ↓ اِفْتَرَضَ: (S,<br>\
A, Mgh, O, K:) or فَرْضٌ is like إِيجَابٌ; but the<br>\
latter is so termed in consideration of its befalling; and the former is so called in consideration<br>\
of the sentence, or decree, respecting it: (B:)<br>\
[this is said in books on the law, in explanation<br>\
of the opinion of Aboo-Haneefeh, as opposed to<br>\
that of Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee: for] accord. to Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee,<br>\
these two terms are alike; (L, TA;) but accord.<br>\
to Aboo-Haneefeh, the difference between الوَاجِبُ<br>\
and الفَرْضُ is like the difference between heaven<br>\
and earth: (TA:) this distinction, however, is<br>\
founded upon contested derivations of the two<br>\
terms: (Kull p. 276:) and it is said that wherever<br>\
the phrase فَرَضَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ occurs, it means إِيجَابٌ.<br>\
(TA.) Also He (the apostle of God) instituted,<br>\
or prescribed, [a thing as a statute, or an ordinance, or a command or prohibition;] syn. سَنَّ;<br>\
(O, K;) on the authority of IAar alone: (O,<br>\
TA:) but accord. to others, he made necessarily<br>\
obligatory or binding; and this, says Az, is the<br>\
obvious meaning. (TA.) Also He (a judge)<br>\
decreed, or adjudged, [TA.) Also He (a judge)<br>\
decreed, or adjudged, [a thing, as, for instance,]<br>\
expenses [&amp;c.]. (Msb.) Also He assigned, or<br>\
appointed, a particular time for doing a thing;<br>\
or he determined, defined, or limited, a thing as<br>\
to time, or otherwise; the inf. n., فَرْضٌ, being syn.<br>\
with تَوْقِيتٌ: (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, A, O, K:) as in the<br>\
phrase فَمَنْ فَرَضَ فِيهِنَّ الحَجَّ [And whoso determineth the performance of the pilgrimage therein];<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, O, K;) occurring in the Kur [ii.<br>\
193]; and in like manner it is expl. by Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Arafeh as occurring in xxxiii. 38 of the Kur<br>\
(O, TA:) but the phrase quoted above is also<br>\
expl. as meaning and whoso maketh it obligatory,<br>\
or binding, on himself to perform the pilgrimage<br>\
therein, by his entering upon the state of إِحْرَام.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  سُورَةٌ أَنْزَلْنَاهَا وَفَرَضْنَاهَا, (K,) in the Kur,<br>\
[commencing chap. xxiv.,] (TA,) means [This is<br>\
a chapter which we have revealed and] in which<br>\
we have set down the obligatory statutes: (O, K:)<br>\
or in which we have bound you to do according to<br>\
what is made obligatory therein: (Az, O:) or, as<br>\
some read, ↓ وَفَرَّضْنَاهَا, (S, O, K, *) meaning and<br>\
in which we have set down obligatory statutes, (O,<br>\
L, K,) one after another: (O, K:) or which we<br>\
have distinctly explained: (Az, S, O, K:) or we<br>\
have distinctly explained what is in it, of lawful<br>\
and unlawful [things]. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  فَرْضٌ also<br>\
signifies The act of reading, or reciting. (IAar,<br>\
O, K.) You say, فَرَضْتُ جُزْئِى I read, or recited,<br>\
my portion. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  فَرُضَ, inf. n. فَرَاضَةٌ,<br>\
He was, or became, skilled in the فَرَائِض; (A, O,<br>\
K, TA;) i. e. in the science of the division of inheritances. (TA.) MF says that, accord. to IKtt,<br>\
the verb is also written فَرَضَ, like كَتَبَ: but<br>\
[says SM] what I find in his “ Kitáb el-Abniyeh ”<br>\
is the mention of the two modes of writing in the<br>\
instance of فرضت said of a cow; and the verb<br>\
applied to a man he has not mentioned. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  فَرَضَتْ, aor.<br>\
فَرِضَ, inf. n. فُرُوضٌ; and فَرُضَتْ, inf. n.<br>\
فَرَاضَةٌ; She (a cow) became old, aged, far advanced<br>\

became wide; it widened, or dilated. (TA.)<br>\

فَرَّضَ see 1, first sentence: and again, in the last<br>\
quarter of the paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  فرّض, inf. n. تَفْرِيضٌ,<br>\
said of a man, He had a فَرِيضَة [to give from]<br>\
among his camels. (O, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
افرض لَهُ: and افرضهُ: see 1, latter part of<br>\
the first half of the paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  أَفْرَضَتِ المَاشِيَةُ<br>\
The beasts amounted to the number which rendered<br>\
it obligatory on the owner to give from among<br>\
them a فَرِيضَة. (S, O, K. *)<br>\
8<br>\
افترضهُ: see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  لَمْ يَفْتَرِضْهَا<br>\
وَلَدٌ, occurring in a trad., means [A child had not<br>\
been brought forth by her; lit.] لَمْ يَحُزَّهَا, and لَمْ<br>\
يُوءَتِّرْهَا [a mistake for لم يُوءَشِّرْهَا]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also 1, latter part of the first half of the paragraph.<br>\
-A3-  افترض الجُنْدٌ The soldiers received their<br>\
stipends. (A, K.)<br>\
-A4-  افترض القَوْمُ The people,<br>\
or company of men, perished, none of them remaining; syn. انقرض. (K.)<br>\
فَرْضٌ A mark [made by notching, or otherwise;<br>\
as is shown by the first explanation of 1]: (TA:)<br>\
a notch, or an incision, in a thing: (O, TA:) of<br>\
a bow, (S, A, K,) the place of the string; (K;)<br>\
the notch (S, A, O) in the curved extremity<br>\
thereof, (A,) into which the string falls; (S, O;)<br>\
as also ↓ فُرْضَةٌ; (A, TA;) or this is the place of<br>\
the notch for the string thereof: (Msb:) pl. of<br>\
the former فِرَاضٌ (S, O, K) and فُرُوضٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and of the latter فُرَضٌ (Msb, TA) and فِرَاضٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) also, of a زَنْد, (S, K,) or [rather] of a زَنْدَة,<br>\
(A,) the notch; (K;) or the place, or part, whence<br>\
the fire is produced; (S, K;) the hole, or perforation, that is made in the head thereof, into which<br>\
the زَنْد is put, and then twisted round, in producing fire; also called وَكْرٌ; (A;) and ↓ فُرْضَةٌ<br>\
signifies the same: (TA:) and فُرَضٌ also signifies notches in an unfeathered and headless<br>\
arrow [such as is used in the game called المَيْسِر].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  I. q. ↓ مَفْرُوضٌ (A, Msb, K) [Apportioned: appointed; made lawful, or allowable:<br>\
and] a thing made obligatory, or binding, by<br>\
God; (S, A, O, K;) for neglecting which one<br>\
will be punished; like وَاجِبٌ; accord. to EshSháfi&#39;ee; (TA in art. وجب;) because it has<br>\
marks and limits; (S, O, TA;) said to be from<br>\
the same word signifying “ a mark,” because it<br>\
inseparably pertains to a man, like a mark;<br>\
(TA;) or, as some say, because it necessarily<br>\
pertains to a man like as does the فَرْض, i. e.<br>\
notch, to the arrow; (O, TA;) as also ↓ مُفْتَرَضٌ:<br>\
(TA:) pl. فُرُوضٌ. (Msb.) As a law-term, it is<br>\
of two sorts, فَرْضُ عَيْنٍ and فَرْضُ كِفَايَةٍ: the<br>\
former is That whereof the observance is obligatory<br>\
on every one, and does not become of no force in<br>\
respect of some in consequence of the observance<br>\
[thereof] by some [others]; as religious belief,<br>\
and the like: the latter is That whereof the observance is obligatory on the collective body of the<br>\
Muslims, and, in consequence of the observance<br>\
[thereof] by some, becomes of no force in respect<br>\
of the rest; as warring against unbelievers, and<br>\
the prayer over the dead in the bier. (KT.) You<br>\
say, هٰذَا أَمْرٌ فَرْضٌ عَلَيْهِمْ, and ↓ مَفْرُوضٌ, and<br>\
↓ مُفْتَرَضٌ, This is [a thing] made obligatory, or<br>\
binding, on them by God. (TA.) And حَقُّكَ<br>\
فَرْضٌ, and ↓ مَفْرُوضٌ, and ↓ مُفْتَرَضٌ, Thy right, or<br>\
due, is [a thing] made obligatory, or binding, by<br>\
God. (A.) ↓ نَصِيبًا مَفْرُوضًا, in the Kur [iv. 8<br>\
and 118], means A share, or portion, determined,<br>\
defined, or limited, as to time, or otherwise: (Zj,<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Arafeh:) or, in iv. 118, a share, or portion,<br>\
cut off and limited. (S, O.) [See also فَرِيضَةٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  A statute, an ordinance, a command or prohibition, of the Apostle of God; syn. سُنَّةٌ. (IAar,<br>\
O, K.) [But فَرْضٌ is generally distinguished from<br>\
سُنَّةٌ: the former, for instance, being applied to<br>\
prayer appointed in the Kur-án; and the latter,<br>\
to prayer appointed by Mohammad without allegation of a divine order.] ―<br>\
-b3-  A gift, or a soldier&#39;s<br>\
stipend or pay, syn. عَطَآءٌ, (A,) or عَطِيَّةٌ, (S, O, K,)<br>\
assigned, or appointed. (S, O, K. *) In the copies<br>\
of the K, مَوْسُومَة is put by mistake for مَرْسُومَة.<br>\
(TA.) You say, مَا أَصَبْتُ مِنْهُ فَرْضًا وَلَا قَرْضًا I did<br>\
not obtain from him an assigned, or appointed,<br>\
gift, or soldier&#39;s stipend, (S, O, TA,) nor a gift<br>\
to be requited, or a loan. (O, TA.) And فَرْضٌ<br>\
also signifies A thing which one makes obligatory,<br>\
or binding, on himself, and freely gives: or a thing<br>\
which one gives liberally, not for a recompense.<br>\
(IDrd, O, K.)<br>\
-A3-  Also Soldiers who receive stipends; (K:) so accord. to Lth, as related by Az;<br>\
but [Sgh says] I have not found it in the book<br>\
of Lth: (O:) or soldiers having definite portions<br>\
assigned to them: (A:) pl. فُرُوضٌ. (A, TA.) You<br>\
say, عِنْدَهُ مِائَةٌ مِنَ الفَرْضِ He has with him a<br>\
hundred soldiers &amp;c. (A.)<br>\
-A4-  A shield. (S, O,<br>\
K.) Sakhr-el-Gheí says, describing lightning,<br>\
(O, TA,) likening it to a light shield which an<br>\
announcer of tidings was turning over and over<br>\
with his hands that a party might see it and be<br>\
gladdened [by the signal], (TA,)<br>\
أَرِقْتُ لَهُ مِثْلَ لَمْعِ البَشِيرِ<br>\
يُقَلِّبُ بِالكَفِّ فَرْضًا خَفِيفًا<br>\
[I was sleepless by reason of it, it being (in its<br>\
flickering) like the signalling of the announcer of<br>\
tidings turning over and over with the hand a<br>\
light shield]: one should not say قُرْصًا خفيفا. (S,<br>\
O, TA: but my copies of the S have قَلَّبَ instead<br>\
of يُقَلِّبُ.) [See also what follows.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And A<br>\
stick, or piece of wood; syn. عُودٌ; thus [it means]<br>\
in the verse (فِى البَيْتِ) accord. to El-Jumahee,<br>\
(O, TA,) i. e. in the verse above-cited: (TA:)<br>\
he says, الفَرْضُ فِى البَيْتِ عُودٌ: (O, TA:) whence<br>\
the author of the K has been misled to explain<br>\
الفَرْضُ as meaning عُودٌ مِنْ أَعْوَادِ البَيْتِ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And An arrow before it has been furnished<br>\
with feathers and a head: (Akh, S, O, TA:) a<br>\
meaning also heard by El-Jumahee: (O, TA:)<br>\
and to this, in the hand of the player, &#39;Abeed ElAbras has likened lightning, accord. to the S;<br>\
but Sgh says, in the TS, that he did not find the<br>\
verse cited by J in the poetry of &#39;Abeed. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And A piece of rag: another explanation<br>\
heard by El-Jumahee. (O.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And A garment,<br>\
or piece of cloth: (O, K:) a meaning mentioned<br>\
by As on the authority of some one or more of<br>\
the Arabs of the desert, of Hudheyl. (O.) [See<br>\
also فِرَاضٌ.] ―<br>\
-b6-  And it is said that in the verse<br>\
cited above it means the notch in the زَنْد [or<br>\
rather زَنْدَة, mentioned in the first sentence of<br>\
this paragraph]. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A5-  A sort of dates<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K) of &#39;Omán: (Msb:) As says that<br>\
the best dates of &#39;Omán are these and the بَلْعَق:<br>\
(S, O:) and AHn says, Certain of the desertArabs of &#39;Omán informed me that when the tree<br>\
thereof has its fruit ripened, and the gathering is<br>\
delayed, the fruit falls from its stones, and the<br>\
raceme remains with nothing upon it but stones<br>\
hanging to the ثَفَارِيق [by which they are attached<br>\
to the ends of the stalks]. (TA.)<br>\
فِرْضٌ The fruit of the دَوْم [or Theban palm]<br>\
while continuing red. (AA, O, * K.)<br>\
فُرْضَةٌ: see فَرْضٌ, first sentence, in two places,<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  A gap, or an opening, in a wall and the like:<br>\
pl. فُرَضٌ. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A gap, or breach, in the<br>\
bank of a river, (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) whence<br>\
one draws water, (S, O, K,) or by which one<br>\
descends to the water, (Mgh, Msb,) and by which<br>\
the ships, or boats, ascend; (Msb;) i. e. (Mgh)<br>\
its مَشْرَعَة: (As, A, Mgh:) pl., in this and the<br>\
following senses, فُرَضٌ (TA) and فِرَاضٌ. (A, TA.)<br>\
Hence the saying, in a trad., فَاجْعَلُوا السُّيُوفَ<br>\
لِلْمَنَايَا فُرَضًا (assumed tropical:)  Therefore make ye the swords to be<br>\
مَشَارِع [here used in the sense of means of access]<br>\
to death; (O, TA;) and offer, or expose, yourselves to martyrdom. (TA.) Hence also, فِرَاضٌ<br>\
is used in the sense of ثُغُورٌ [pl. of ثَغْرٌ, q. v.].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Of a sea, or great river, The place<br>\
where ships unload; syn. مَحَطُّ السُّفُنِ: (S, O, K:)<br>\

فِرَاضٌ The mouth of a river or rivulet. (S, O,<br>\
K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Roads, or ways. (Lth, O, K.) [In<br>\
this latter sense, app., (as well as in others shown<br>\
above,) pl. of فُرْضَةٌ, q. v.]<br>\

near the end.]<br>\
فَرِيضٌ An arrow having its notch cut; (S, A,<br>\
O, K;) as also ↓ مَفْرُوضٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
فَرَضِىٌّ:<br>\
-A2-  and see فَارِضٌ.<br>\
-A3-  Also The cud of<br>\
the camel; accord. to Kr: but accord. to others<br>\
this is called, قَرِيض [q. v.], with ق. (TA.)<br>\
فَرِيضَةٌ, of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ in the sense of the<br>\
measure مَفْعُولَةٌ: pl. فَرَائِضُ: said by some to be<br>\
derived from فَرْضٌ signifying the act of “ apportioning,” or “ appointing; ” because فرائض are<br>\
apportioned, or appointed: by others said to be<br>\
from فَرْضٌ in relation to a bow. (Msb.) [These<br>\
remarks apply to the word in all the senses here<br>\
following.] ―<br>\
-b2-  A subst. signifying A thing made<br>\
obligatory, or binding, on a person or persons, (S,<br>\

(TA:) or anything apportioned, or appointed:<br>\
[and particularly a primarily-apportioned inheritance: (see an ex. in the first paragraph of art.<br>\
عول:)] and hence, فَرَائِضُ is applied to the portions, or shares, of inheritances; [i. e. the fixed<br>\
primary portions of inheritances assigned by the<br>\
Kur-án; which are a half, third, fourth, sixth,<br>\
and eighth;] because they are apportioned, or<br>\
appointed, to their several owners. (Mgh.) And<br>\

الفَرَائِضُ, (S, * Mgh, O, * Msb,) The science of the<br>\
division of inheritances; (S, O, TA;) or the science<br>\
of questions relating to inheritance. (Mgh.) It is<br>\
said in a trad., (Mgh,) تَعَلَّمُوا الفَرَائِضَ وَعَلِّمُوهَا<br>\
النَّاسَ فَإِنَّهَا نِصْفُ العِلْمِ, accord. to the relation<br>\
commonly followed, with the pron. fem., referring<br>\
to الفرائض; and وَعَلِّمُوهُ فَإِنَّهُ, with the pron. masc.,<br>\
referring to عِلْم understood as prefixed to الفرائض;<br>\
[i. e. Learn ye the science of the division of inheritances, &amp;c., and teach ye it to (other) men, for<br>\
it is the half of science:] it is said to be called the<br>\
half of science in consideration of the division of<br>\
statutes into those which pertain to the living and<br>\
those which pertain to the dead; or by way of<br>\
amplification. (Mgh, * Msb.) The phrase الفَرِيضَةُ<br>\
العَادِلَةُ [The equitable portion of inheritance], in a<br>\
trad. of Ibn-&#39;Omár, is that respecting which the<br>\
Muslims have agreed: or that for which the<br>\
authority is elicited from the Kur-án and the<br>\
Sunneh without there being in these any express<br>\
statute respecting it: or that is equitably divided,<br>\
agreeably with the portions and shares mentioned<br>\
in the Kur-án and the Sunneh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  What is<br>\
made obligatory, or binding, [on the owner, to give,]<br>\
of pasturing beasts, [i. e. camels,] in payment of the<br>\
poor-rate; (S, O, K;) the camel that is taken in<br>\
payment of the poor-rate: so termed because it is<br>\
made obligatory to be given, of a certain number<br>\
of camels: the ة is added because the word is<br>\
made a subst., not an epithet: pl. فَرَائِضُ: (TA:)<br>\
فَرَائِضُ الإِبِلِ signifying the dues of the poor-rate,<br>\
of camels: (A, Mgh: *) the فريضة of twenty-five<br>\
