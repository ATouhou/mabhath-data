فَخُمَ, (S, M, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. فَخَامَةٌ,<br>\
(S, &amp;c.,) He (a man, S) was, or became, large,<br>\
big, bulky, or thick. (S, M, K, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He<br>\
was, or became, great in respect of estimation,<br>\
rank, or quality. (So accord. to an explanation<br>\
of the inf. n. in the KL [agreeably with an explanation of the epithet فَخْمٌ].) See also مُفَخَّمٌ,<br>\
below. ―<br>\
-b3-  And one says also فَخُمَ الأَمْرُ [meaning<br>\
Great in estimation is the thing or affair or event<br>\
or case!]. (K in art. بخ, in which see بَخْ.)<br>\
2<br>\
تَفْخِيمٌ is syn. with تَعْظِيمٌ [as signifying The<br>\
magnifying a man, honouring him, or treating<br>\
him with respect or reverence or veneration]: (S,<br>\
K, TA:) one says, أَتَيْنَا فُلَانًا فَفَخَّمْنَاهُ meaning<br>\
[We came to such a one] and we magnified him,<br>\
or honoured him, and paid him high respect: and<br>\
↓ تفخّمهُ signifies [the same as فخّمهُ, i. e.] He<br>\
magnified him, or honoured him, &amp;c.; syn. أَجَلَّهُ,<br>\
and عَظَّمَهُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تَفْخِيمُ الحَرْفِ is the contr.<br>\
of إِمَالَتُهُ [i. e. it signifies The pronouncing of the<br>\
word with the broad sound of the lengthened fet-h<br>\
(approaching to the sound of “ a ” in our word<br>\
“ ball ”)]: (S:) [and also with a full sound of the<br>\
letter ل:] or التَّفْخِيمُ is the abstaining from<br>\
الإِمَالَة; (K, and Kull p. 127;) and the contr. of<br>\
التَّرْقِيقُ; i. e. i. q. التَّغْلِيظُ; and signifies the inclining of ا towards the place of utterance of و, as<br>\
in the word الصَّلَوةُ; and the uttering of ل from<br>\
the lower part of the tongue [i. e. with the tongue<br>\
turned up], as in the word اَللّٰه [i. e. in the word<br>\
اللّٰه not immediately preceded by a kesreh]: (Kull<br>\
ubi suprà:) it is [predominantly] peculiar to the<br>\
people of El-Hijáz, like as الامالة is to the tribe of<br>\
Temeem. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also what next follows.<br>\
5<br>\
تَفَخَّمَ [تفخّم signifies He magnified, or aggrandized, himself; as is shown by a verse cited in<br>\
the first paragraph of art. فيل; in which verse it<br>\
is said in the M that ↓ فَخَّمُوا means تَفَخَّمُوا.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
And it is also trans., like 2:] see 2, first sentence.<br>\
فَخْمٌ [seems to signify primarily Large, big,<br>\
bulky, or thick. And hence,] A man having much<br>\
flesh in the balls, or elevated parts, of the cheeks.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And predominantly,] Great in estimation, rank, or quality; (S, K, TA;) applied to a<br>\
man: (S, TA:) pl. فِخَامٌ: the fem. is فَخْمَةٌ.<br>\
(TA.) And it is likewise applied to حَسَب [or<br>\
grounds of pretension to respect or honour].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And to speech, or diction, (مَنْطِق,)<br>\
meaning Strong; sound, or correct; or chaste,<br>\
clear, or eloquent, and comprehensive; syn. جَزْلٌ.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
فَخْمَةٌ fem. of فَخْمٌ [q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A<br>\
great army or military force. (TA.)<br>\
فُخَمِيَّةٌ, like جُهَنِيَّةٌ, (so in the JK, K, and TA,<br>\
[in the CK and my MS. copy of the K فُخَيْمَة,<br>\
like جُهَيْنَة,]) Self-magnification, pride, or haughtiness, and assumption of superiority. (JK, K, TA.)<br>\
فَيْخَمَانٌ A person of authority, (TA,) one held<br>\
in honour, from whose judgment events are made<br>\
to proceed, and without whom no affair is decided.<br>\
(K, TA. [In the explanation of this word in the<br>\
CK, يَصْدُرُ is a mistranscription for يُصْدَرُ.])<br>\
أَفْخَمُ i. q. أَعْظَمُ [as meaning Most, or very,<br>\
great in estimation, rank, or quality; applied to<br>\
a man]. (TA.)<br>\
مُفَخَّمٌ, occurring in a trad., as an epithet applied to the Prophet, means Magnified, honoured,<br>\
or regarded with respect or reverence or veneration, in the minds and the eyes [of others: and so<br>\
it means when applied in a general manner]: not<br>\
largeness in his bodily make: or, as some say, it<br>\
means [characterized by] ↓ فَخَامَة in his face, [i. e.]<br>\
its nobleness, and fulness, with beauty, or comeliness, and a quality inspiring reverence or veneration. (TA.)<br>\
