فَدَمْتُ عَلَى فِيِه بِالغِدَامِ, [aor.<br>\
فَدِمَ,] inf. n. فَدْمٌ,<br>\
I covered his, or its, mouth with the فِدَام [q. v.]:<br>\
(S:) or فَدَمَ فَاهُ, and عَلَى فِيهِ, aor.<br>\
فَدِمَ, and ↓ فدّم,<br>\
(M, K, TA,) inf. n. تَفْدِيمٌ; (TA;) he put the<br>\
فِدَام upon his, or its, mouth: (M, K:) [app. used<br>\
in relation to a man and also to an إِبْرِيق or other<br>\
vessel: but the latter verb, and as trans. without<br>\
a particle, seems to be more commonly used in<br>\
relation to both:] one says of Persians or other<br>\
foreigners, and of Magians, on the occasion of<br>\
their giving to drink, أَفْوَاهَهُمْ ↓ فَدَّمُوا They bound<br>\
the فَدَّام upon their mouths: (T:) and ↓ فدّم<br>\
الإِبْرِيقَ, (M, K,) inf. n. تَفْدِيمٌ, (K,) He put the<br>\
فِدَام upon the mouth of the ابريق. (M, K. *)<br>\
-A2-<br>\

K) and فُدُومَةٌ, (S, M, Msb, K,) He was or became, such as is termed فَدْم [q. v.]; or he was<br>\
or became, heavy, sluggish, or dull; and confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his right<br>\
course. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
فَدَّمَ see the preceding paragraph, in three places.<br>\
One says also, فدّم البَعِيرَ, meaning He bound upon<br>\
the camel&#39;s mouth the فِدَامَة, (M,) which means<br>\
the غِمَامَة [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
فَدْمٌ Impotent (T, S, M, K) in speech, (T, M,<br>\
K,) and in adducing an argument; (T, M;) [as<br>\
though his mouth were covered with a فِدَام, for<br>\
it is said in the S to be from فَدَمْتُ عَلَى فِيهِ<br>\
بِالفِدَامِ;] heavy, sluggish, or dull; (S;) or with<br>\
heaviness, sluggishness, or dulness, and softness, and<br>\
paucity of understanding: (M, K:) or unintelligent: (Msb:) and thick; (M, K;) fat; (M;)<br>\
foolish, or stupid; rough, rude, or uncivil: (M,<br>\
K:) accord. to IAar, the heavy, sluggish, or dull;<br>\
as being likened to blood, which is thus called:<br>\
(T:) and ثَدْمٌ is a dial. var. thereof, or, accord.<br>\
to Yaakoob, the ث is a substitute for the ف: (M:)<br>\
the fem. is with ة: (M, Msb, K:) and the pl. is<br>\
فِدَامٌ [agreeably with analogy]. (M, K: in a<br>\
copy of the T فُدُم [which I think a mistranscription].) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Heavy [and app. thick] blood:<br>\
and, accord. to IAar, blood [itself]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
A garment, or piece of cloth, (T, TA,) saturated<br>\
with dye, (T,) or saturated with red dye by its<br>\
being put again into the safflower time after time.<br>\
(TA.) And Red that is saturated (M, K) with<br>\
redness: (K:) or of which the redness is not intense. (Thus also in some copies of the K.) [See<br>\
also مُفْدَمٌ.]<br>\
فَدَامٌ: see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
فِدَامٌ and ↓ فَدَامٌ and ↓ فَدَّامُ and ↓ فَدُّومٌ, (K,)<br>\
or ↓ فَدَّامٌ [only], (S, T, M,) A thing which the<br>\
Persians or other foreigners, (T, K,) and the<br>\
Magians, (K,) bind upon their mouths on the<br>\
occasion of their giving to drink; (T, K;) or a<br>\
piece of cloth with which the Magian binds his<br>\
mouth; (S;) or a sort of thing with which the<br>\
Persians or other foreigners wipe [app. the mouth]<br>\
when they give to drink; one of which is termed<br>\
↓ فَدَّامَةٌ. (M. [In the S it seems to be implied<br>\
that this last word is syn. with فَدَّامٌ as expl.<br>\
above.]) ―<br>\

and also ↓ فَدَّامٌ, (S,) or and also ↓ فَدَامٌ, (M,) A<br>\
strainer, or clarifier, (T, S, M, K,) for a mug<br>\
and an إِبْرِيق and the like; (T;) a thing that is<br>\
put in, or upon, the mouth of the ابريق, for the<br>\
straining, or clarifying, of what is in it: (S, M: *)<br>\
also called ثِدَامٌ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فِدَامٌ signifies<br>\
also the same as عِمَامَةٌ: thus in copies of the K<br>\
[and in a copy of the M]: but the former word<br>\
is correctly ↓ فِدَامَةٌ [as is implied in one place in<br>\
the M]; and the word by which it is explained is<br>\
correctly غِمَامَهٌ, [as in some copies of the K,]<br>\
meaning A thing that is put upon the mouth of<br>\
the camel. (TA. [See 2: and see also the first<br>\
paragraph of art. غم.])<br>\

in a trad., إِنَّكُمْ مَدْعُوُّونَ يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ مُفَدَّمَةً أَفْوَاهُكُمْ<br>\
بِالفِدَامِ [Verily ye will be summoned on the day<br>\
of resurrection having your mouths closed with<br>\
the فدام]; meaning, ye will be withheld from<br>\
speaking with your mouths, so that your skins<br>\
will speak. (M.)<br>\
