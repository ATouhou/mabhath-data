load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'فىفِى is a particle governing the gen. case [and<br>\
used in the manners and senses expl in what here<br>\
follows]. (T, S, M, Mughnee, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It relates<br>\
to a receptacle; (Sb, S, M;) and, when used in<br>\
a wider sense, to that which has some near resemblance thereto; (Sb, M;) [i. e.,] and also to<br>\
what is considered as a receptacle: (S:) [in other<br>\
words,] it denotes inclusion, or inbeing, (Msb,<br>\
Mughnee, K, TA,) either in relation to place or<br>\
in relation to time: (Mughnee, K, TA;) properly<br>\
and tropically. (Msb, Mughnee, TA.) غُلِبَتِ<br>\
الرُّومُ فِى أَدْنَى الْأَرْضِ وَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ غَلَبِهِمْ سَيَغْلِبُونَ<br>\
فِى بِضْعِ سِنِينَ [The Greeks have been overcome in<br>\
the nearer, or nearest, part of the land, and they,<br>\
after the overcoming of them, shall overcome in<br>\
some few years], in the Kur [xxx. 1 — 3], is an<br>\
ex. of its relation to place and to time. (Mughnee.) And وَلَكُمْ فِى الْقِصَاصِ حَيٰوةٌ (tropical:)  [And there<br>\
is, to you, in retaliation, life, or an advantage,<br>\
(respecting the meaning of which see art. حى,)<br>\
in the Kur ii. 175,] is an ex. of its being used<br>\
tropically, (Mughnee.) أَدْخَلْتُ الخَاتَمَ فِى أُصْبَعِى<br>\
is an ex. of its relation to place, but the proposition is inverted [i. e. the meaning is I inserted<br>\
my finger into the signet-ring]. (Mughnee.)<br>\
[Using it properly,] you say, المَآءُ فِى الإِنَآءِ [The<br>\
water is in the vessel]: (S:) and هُوَ فِى الجِرَابِ<br>\
[It is in the wallet,] and فِى الكِيسِ [in the purse]:<br>\
and هُوَ فِى بَطْنِ أُمِّهِ [He is in the belly of his<br>\
mother]: and هُوَ فِى الغُلِّ [He is in the shackle<br>\
for the neck]: (M:) and زَيْدٌ فِى الدَّارِ [Zeyd is<br>\
in the house], (S, M, * Msb,) or within the house,<br>\
and in the midst of it, for فِى الدَّارِ, means دَاخِلِهَا,<br>\
and وَسْطَهَا: (T:) and [using it tropically, you<br>\
say,] الشَّكُّ فِى الخَبَرِ (assumed tropical:)  [Doubt, or uncertainty, is<br>\
in the information]. (S.) The saying فِيهِ عَيْبٌ<br>\
[In him is a fault, or blemish], if relating to a<br>\
real عَيْب, is proper; and if relating to an ideal<br>\
عَيْب, tropical: the former is such as the amputation of the hand of the thief, and the redundance<br>\
of a hand; and the latter, such as the runningaway of a slave. (Msb.) [When relating to<br>\
time, it may in some cases be rendered In, or<br>\
during; as in the phrase فِى أَيَّامٍ مَعْدُودَاتٍ, in<br>\
the Kur ii. 139, i. e. In, or during, certain numbered days. إِنَّ أَصْحَابَ الْجَنَّةِ الْيَوْمَ فِى شُغُلٍ<br>\
فَاكِهُونَ, in the Kur xxxvi. 55, may be rendered<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Verily the inmates of Paradise this day shall be<br>\
in the midst of diverting occupation, cheerful, or<br>\
happy. The phrase أَمَّا قَوْلُهُ كَذَا فِيهِ مَا فِيهِ, lit.<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  As to his saying thus, in it is what is in it, is<br>\
used as a polite expression of objection, or contradiction; like فِيهِ تَأَمُّلٌ, q. v. In many instances, فِى may be rendered Of, or concerning,<br>\
or in respect of; as in قَالَ فِيهِ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He said of,<br>\
or concerning, him, or it, thus; for قَالَ فِى ذِكْرِهِ<br>\
كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  He said in mentioning him, or it, thus,<br>\
or فِى وَصْفِهِ in describing him, or it; or the like<br>\
hence, for ex., one says كَتَبَ كِتَابًا فِى عِلْمِ اللُّغَةِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He wrote a book of, or concerning the science of<br>\
lexicology: and hence, in the Kur ii. 133, أَتُّحَاجُّونَنَا<br>\
فِى اللّٰهِ  (assumed tropical:)  Do ye argue with us concerning, or in<br>\
respect of, God?] ―<br>\
-b3-  It also denotes concomitance, (Mughnee, K,) and (K) in this ease<br>\
(Mughnee) it is syn. with مَعَ. (Msb, Mughnee,<br>\
K.) Thus in the phrase, قَالَ ادْخُلُوا فِى أُمَمٍ [He<br>\
shall say, Enter ye with peoples]. (Msb, Mughnee,<br>\
TA,) in the Kur [vii. 36]: (Msb, TA:) or, as<br>\
some say, the meaning is, فِى جَمَاعَةِ أُمَمٍ [in the<br>\
company of peoples]. (Mughnee.) Thus. too, in<br>\
the phrase, in the Kur [xlvi. 15], فِى أَصْحَابِ<br>\
الجَنَّةِ [With the inmates of Paradise]. (Msb,<br>\
TA.) [Or in these and similar instances, فِى<br>\
may be rendered, more agreeably with the primary<br>\
signification, as meaning Among.] In the K, the<br>\
meaning as denoting concomitance and that which<br>\
is identical with مَعَ are made distinct: and it has<br>\
been said that بِ denotes the continuance of concomitance and مَعَ denotes its commencement;<br>\
though this is not invariably the case. (MF,<br>\
TA.) [Hence it is used to denote a combination<br>\
of two qualities: as in the phrase طُولٌ فِى اسْتِرْخَآءٍ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Length together with laxness: (occurring in the<br>\
K voce طَنَبٌ:) and سَوَادٌ فِى حُمْرَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  Blackness<br>\
blending with redness: and the like. And in like<br>\
manner it is used to denote the combination of<br>\
the length and breadth of a thing: as in the phrase<br>\
طُولُهُ عِشْرُونَ ذِرَاعًا فِى ثَلَاثِ أَذْرُعٍ عَرْضًا Its length is<br>\
twenty cubits with (or as we say by) three cubits<br>\
in breadth: in which case the number of square<br>\
cubits is expressed by the phrase عِشْرُونَ فِى ثَلَاثٍ<br>\
as though meaning Twenty as a multiplicand with<br>\
three as its multiplier; i. e. twenty multiplied by<br>\
three: see ضَرَبَ as signifying “ he multiplied. ”].<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  It also denotes the assigning of a cause. (Msb,<br>\
Mughnee, K.) Thus in the phrase فِى أَرْبَعِينَ شَاةٌ<br>\
i. e. On account, or because, of completing [the<br>\
possession of] forty sheep or goats, [the giving of]<br>\
a sheep or goat [for the poor-rate] is incumbent<br>\
[on the possessor: or this may be rendered, in<br>\
the case of the possession of forty, a sheep or<br>\
goat is to be given]. (Msb.) And thus in the<br>\
saying, [in the Kur xii. 32,] فَذٰلِكُنَّ الَّذِى لُمْتُنَّنِى<br>\
فِيهِ [And that is he because of whom ye blamed<br>\
me]. (Mughnee.) Thus also in the saying, in a<br>\
trad., إِنَّ امْرَأَةً دَخَلَتِ النَّارَ فِى هِرَّةٍ حَبَسَتْهَا [Verily<br>\
a woman entered the fire of Hell because of a she-cat which she confined without food]. (Mughnee.)<br>\
[And thus in the phrase أَسْلَفَ فِى كَذَا He paid<br>\
in advance, or beforehand, for, or on account of,<br>\
such a thing.] ―<br>\
-b5-  It also denotes superiority;<br>\
(Mughnee, K, TA;) i. e. (TA) it is used in the<br>\
sense of عَلَى. (T, S, M, Msb, TA.) Thus in<br>\
the saying, in the Kur [xx. 74], وَلَأُصَلِّبَنَّكُمْ فِى<br>\
جُذُوعِ النَّخْلِ [And I will assuredly crucify you<br>\
upon the trunks of palm-trees]. (T, S, Msb,<br>\
Mughnee, TA.) And so in the verse of &#39;Antarah<br>\
cited voce سَرْحٌ. (T, M, Mughnee, TA.) And<br>\
Yoo asserts that the Arabs say, نَزَلْتُ فِى أَبِيكَ,<br>\
meaning عَلَيْهِ [i. e. I alighted, or descended and<br>\
stopped, &amp;c., at the abode of thy father]. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  It is also syn. with بِ, (T, S, M, Mughnee,<br>\
K,) sometimes. (S.) Thus in the saying of<br>\
Zeyd-el-Kheyl,<br>\
وَتَرْكَبُ يَوْمَ الرَّوْعِ فِيهَا فَوَارِسُ<br>\
بَصِيرُونَ فِى طَعْنِ الأَبَاهِرِ والكُلَى<br>\
(S, Mughnee, TA,) meaning, بِطَعْنِ الاباهر والكلى<br>\
[i. e. And horsemen skilful in piercing the aortas<br>\
and the kidneys ride in the day of fear therein].<br>\
(S, TA.) And thus in a verse cited by Fr, أَرْغَبُ<br>\
is made trans. by فِى and عَنْ instead of بِ and<br>\
عَنْ. (T, TA.) [Thus, also, لَيْسَ فِى شَىْءٍ is<br>\
sometimes used for لَيْسَ بِشَىْءٍ, meaning It is<br>\
nought; or not of any account or weight; &amp;c.:<br>\
see more in art. شيأ.] ―<br>\
-b7-  It is also syn. with إِلَى.<br>\
(Mughnee, K.) Thus in the Kur [xiv. 10], فَرَدُّوا<br>\
أَيْدِيَهُمْ فِى أَفْوَاههم [And they put their hands to<br>\
their mouths]. (Mughnee, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  It is also syn.<br>\
with مِنْ. (M, Mughnee, K, TA.) Thus in the<br>\
Kur [xxvii. 12], فِى تِسْعِ آيَاتٍ [Of, or among,<br>\
nine signs]. (M, TA.) And in the saying, خُذْ لِى<br>\
عَشْرًا مِنَ الإِبِلِ فِيهَا فَحْلَانِ [Take thou for me ten<br>\
of the camels; of, or among, them let there be<br>\
two stallions. (M, TA.) [Thus too in the saying هُوَ فِى أَصْلِ قَوْمِهِ He is of, or among, the<br>\
purest in race, &amp;c., of his people: and the like<br>\
thereof.] ―<br>\
-b9-  It also denotes comparison; and this<br>\
is when it occurs between a preceding [mention of<br>\
a] thing excelled and a following [mention of a]<br>\
thing excelling: as in the saying, [in the Kur ix.<br>\
38,] فَمَا مَتَاعُ الْحَيٰوةِ الدُّنْيَا فِى الْآخِرَةِ إِلَّا قَلِيلٌ [But<br>\
the enjoyment of the present life, in comparison<br>\
with that which is to come, is no other than little].<br>\
(Mughnee, K.) ―<br>\
-b10-  It is also used for compensation; and this is when it is redundant as a<br>\
compensation for another [فِى] which is suppressed: as in the saying, ضَرَبْتُ فِيمَنْ رَغِبْتَ for<br>\
ضَرَبْتُ مَنْ رَغِبْتَ فِيهِ [I beat, or struck, him whom<br>\
thou desiredst]: (Mughnee, K:) but this is<br>\
allowed by Ibn-Málik alone. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b11-<br>\
And it is used for corroboration: (Mughnee, K:)<br>\
this is when it is redundant without its being for<br>\
compensation: and this El-Fárisee allows in a<br>\
case of necessity in verse; citing as an ex.,<br>\
أَنَا أَبُوا سَعْدٍ إِذَا اللَّيْلُ دَجَا<br>\
تَخَالُ فِى سَوَادِهِ يَرَنْدَجَا<br>\
[I am Aboo-Saad; when the night becomes dark,<br>\
thou imagining its blackness to be black leather].<br>\
(Mughnee.) And it is thus used in the saying,<br>\
in the Kur [xi. 43], وَقَالَ ارْكَبُوا فِيهَا [for ارْكَبُوهَا,<br>\
i. e. And he said, Embark ye therein, the like<br>\
of which occurs also in xviii. 70 and xxix. 65],<br>\
(Mughnee, K,) accord. to some. (Mughnee.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
فِى as a prefixed noun in the gen. case, syn. with<br>\
فَم, and فِىَّ as syn. with فَمِى, see voce فُوهٌ, in<br>\
art. فوه.<br>\
فَىَّ is a word expressive of wonder: they say,<br>\
يَا فَىَّ مَا لِى أَفْعَلُ كَذَا [O my wonder! What has<br>\
happened to me that I do thus?]: or it is expressive of regret on account of a thing that is passing<br>\
away [so that this exclamation may be rendered<br>\
Oh! What has happened to me &amp;c.]: Ks says<br>\
that it is not to be written withء [though it is so<br>\
written in several of the lexicons in art. فيأ, i. e.<br>\
فَىْءَ]; and that it means يَا عَجَبِى [as first expl.<br>\
above]: and in like manner one says, يَا فَىَّ مَا<br>\
أَصْحَابُكَ [O my wonder! What are thy companions? i. e. what manner of men are thy companions? ما here denoting interrogation respecting qualities, or attributes; as in the Kur xxvi.<br>\
22]: and he says that ما in this case occupies the<br>\
place of a noun in the nom. case. (M, TA.) Ks<br>\
is also related to have said that some of the Arabs<br>\
express wonder by فَىَّ and هَىَّ and شَىْءَ; and<br>\
some add مَا, saying يَا فَيَّمَا and يَا هَيَّمَا and يَا<br>\
شَيْئَمَا, meaning How good, or beautiful, is this!<br>\
the K is faulty here; mentioning only يَا فَيَّمَا, and<br>\
explaining it as denoting wonder. (TA.)<br>\
