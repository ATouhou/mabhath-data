الشَّىْءُ [The thing was, or became, vacant, or unoccupied, for thee; as though it were a place, or<br>\
a vessel: and hence, the thing was, or became,<br>\

the Kur [lv. 31], لَكُمْ سَنَفْرُغُ We will make you<br>\
our object; expl. by IAar as meaning سَنَعْمِدُ<br>\
[which is syn. with سَنَقْصِدُ]; (TA;) and some<br>\
read سَنَفْرَغُ; (O, TA;) and some, سَنِفْرَغُ; (O;)<br>\
and some, سَنِفْرِغُ, asserting that Temeem say نِعْلِمُ;<br>\
(O, TA;) and some, سَنَفْرَغُ إِلَيْكُمْ, meaning سَنَقْصِدُ<br>\
إِلَيْكُمْ; or سَنَفْرُغُ لَكُمْ means We will apply ourself exclusively (سَنَتَجَرَّدُ) to the reckoning with,<br>\

(Ksh:) one says [also] in threatening, لَأَفْرُغَنَّ لَكَ<br>\
[meaning in like manner I will assuredly apply<br>\

was wide; (O, K, TA;) likened to the فَرْغ of<br>\

-b3-  And فَرَاغَةٌ (as an<br>\
inf. n. of which the verb is فَرُغَ, TK) signifies<br>\
The being impatient, and disquieted or disturbed<br>\
or agitated. (O, K.)<br>\
-A3-  فَرَغَ as trans.: see 4.<br>\
2<br>\
فَرَّغْتُهُ I made it empty, vacant, void, devoid,<br>\
destitute, or unoccupied; as also ↓ أَفْرَغْتُهُ. (Msb.)<br>\
تَفْرِيغُ الظُّرُوفِ signifies The making the receptacles empty. (S, O, K.) And some read [in the<br>\
Kur xxxiv. 22], حَتَّى إِذَا فُرِّغَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ, (O, TA,)<br>\
expl. as meaning Until, when their hearts shall be<br>\
made void of fear, or fright: or, accord. to IJ,<br>\
فُرِّغَ and فُزِّعَ and افْرَنْقَعَ [which are all mentioned<br>\
as readings in the same passage] have one meaning. (TA. [See 2 in art. فزع.]) ―<br>\

says, فرّغهُ لِكَذَا He made him to be, or become, or<br>\
he left him, vacant from, devoid of, or free from,<br>\
business, occupation, or employment; or made him<br>\
to be unoccupied, unemployed, or at leisure; so<br>\
that he might apply himself exclusively to such a<br>\
thing.] ―<br>\

inf. n. إِفْرَاغٌ and مُفْرَغٌ, (O,) signifies [also] He<br>\
poured it out, or forth; (S, O, K;) namely, water<br>\

المَآءَ, meaning he poured out, or forth, upon him,<br>\

an ex.,<br>\
فَرَغْنَ الهَوَى فِى القَلْبِ ثُمَّ سَقَيْنَهُ<br>\
صُبَابَاتِ مَآءِ الحُزْنِ بِالأَعْيُنِ النُّجْلِ<br>\
[They (referring to women) poured desirous love<br>\
into the heart; then they gave him to drink the<br>\
remains of the water of grief, by looking with the<br>\
wide eyes: but perhaps فَرَغْنَ is here used for<br>\
فَرَّغْنَ, by poetic license, for the sake of the metre]:<br>\
(TA:) إِفْرَاغَةٌ signifies A single act of إِفْرَاغ; and<br>\
hence the trad. كَانَ يُفْرِغُ عَلَى رَأْسِهِ ثَلَاثَ إِفْرَاغَاتٍ<br>\
[He used to pour upon his head three pourings].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] رَبَّنَا أَفْرِغْ عَلَيْنَا صَبْرًا, in the<br>\

pour forth upon us patience, like as [the water of]<br>\
the leathern bucket is poured forth: (O, TA:) or<br>\

envelop us: (TA:) or أَفْرَغَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ الصَّبْرَ means<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  God inspired him with patience. (Msb in art.<br>\
ربط.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence, also,] أَفْرَغَ عَلَيْهِ ذَنُوبًا [lit. He<br>\
poured forth upon him a bucketful of water]<br>\
means (tropical:)  he talked with him of that in consequence<br>\
of which he was confounded, or perplexed, by<br>\
shame. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  افرغ also signifies He poured<br>\
metal, such as gold and silver &amp;c., in a molten<br>\
state, into a mould. (TA.) And He cast a thing,<br>\
i. e. formed it by pouring molten metal into a<br>\

-b6-<br>\
And افرغ عِنْدَ الجِمَاعِ He poured forth his مَآء [or<br>\
sperma] on the occasion of جماع. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تفرّغ He was, or became, or he made himself<br>\
to be, vacant from, devoid of, or free from, business, occupation, or employment; unoccupied, unemployed, or at leisure; syn. تَخَلَّى مِنَ الشُّغْلِ.<br>\
(O, K.) [See also فَرَغَ مِنَ الشُّغْلِ.] Hence the<br>\
trad. of the Prophet, تَفَرَّغُوا مِنْ هُمُومِ الدُّنْيَا مَا<br>\
اسْتَطَعْتُمْ [Be ye, or make yourselves to be, vacant,<br>\
or free, from the anxieties of the present state of<br>\
existence as much as ye are able]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
تَفَرَّغْتُ لِكَذَا [I was, or became, or I made myself<br>\
to be, vacant, or free, from business, occupation,<br>\
or employment; or unoccupied, unemployed, or at<br>\
leisure; for such a thing: and I applied myself<br>\
exclusively to such a thing]: (S: [these meanings<br>\
are there indicated, but not expressed; and are<br>\
well known:]) one says, تفرّغ لِلْعِبَادَةِ [He applied<br>\
himself exclusively to religious service]: (Msb in<br>\
art. بتل:) and تَفَرَّغْتُ لِلْأَمْرِ means [also, simply,]<br>\
تَصَدَّيْتُ لَهُ [i. e. I addressed, or applied, or<br>\
directed, myself, or my regard, or attention, or<br>\
mind, to the affair]. (Msb in art. صد.) [See also<br>\

-b3-  And تفرّغ بِهِ signifies تَخَلَّى<br>\
بِهِ [meaning He confined himself exclusively to it;<br>\
or contented himself with it exclusively of other<br>\
things]. (K and TA in art. خلو.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِفْتَرَغْتُ I poured forth upon myself (S, O)<br>\
water: (S:) [and so افترغت عَلَى نَفْسِى; for one<br>\
says,] رَأَيْتُهُ يَغْتَرِفُ المَآءَ ثُمَّ يَفْتَرِغُهُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ [I saw<br>\
him taking, or lading out, the water; then pouring<br>\
it forth upon himself]. (A, TA.) And اِفْتَرَغْتُ<br>\
لِنَفْسِى مَآءً I poured out for myself water. (O, K.)<br>\

استفرغ مَا فِى الرَّاوِيَةِ مِنَ المَآءِ [He drew forth<br>\
what was in the leathern water-bag, or pair of<br>\
leathern water-bags, of water]. (TA in art. عزل.)<br>\
El-Akhtal said respecting Esh-Shaabee, meaning<br>\
to denote the largeness of the latter&#39;s retentive<br>\
faculty, أَنَا أَسْتَفْرِغُ مِنْ إِنَآءٍ وَاحِدٍ وَهُوَ يَسْتَفْرِغُ مِنْ<br>\
أَوَانِىَ شَتَّى (tropical:)  [I draw from one vessel, and he<br>\
draws from divers vessels]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He<br>\
vomited intentionally; or constrained himself to<br>\
vomit: (O, K:) thus it signifies in the conventional language of the physicians. (O.) ―<br>\

فُلَانٌ مَا فِى صَحْفَتِهِ is a prov., meaning Such a<br>\
one [exhausted, or] chose for himself, as his share,<br>\
[the whole of] what was in his صحفة [or large<br>\

power, or ability; or exerted it unsparingly, or<br>\

-b2-  And The place whence the water pours forth,<br>\
between the cross-pieces of wood (العَرَاقِى), of the<br>\
leathern-bucket; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ فِرَاغٌ: (K:<br>\
[expl. in the O as signifying the side of the<br>\
leathern bucket from which the water pours<br>\
forth:]) pl. of the former فُرُوغٌ (TA) and مَفَارِغُ,<br>\
[which is anomalous, like مَشَابِهُ and مَحَاسِنُ &amp;c.,]<br>\
(A, TA,) or this is pl. of ↓ مَفْرَغٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence<br>\

star in the head of Andromeda; as is shown by<br>\
what here follows:] the Arabs name الدَّلْوُ the<br>\
four bright stars in Pegasus which form a square,<br>\

of the neck, which is called مَتْنُ الفَرَسِ, and that<br>\
which is called مَنْكِبُ الفَرَسِ, and that which is<br>\
called جَنَاحُ الفَرَسِ, and the star that belongs to<br>\
both Pegasus and Andromeda: (Kzw, descr. of<br>\
Pegasus:) [these two pairs of stars are what are<br>\
commonly known as the فَرْغَانِ; and are plainly<br>\
indicated by the periods assigned to the auroral<br>\
settings thereof: but the periods assigned to their<br>\
auroral risings would lead us to apply the appel-lation of the فرغان to some other stars, not easily<br>\
determinable, in Aquarius: see نَوْءٌ: and see also<br>\
مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل.] The pl. الفُرُوغُ is said<br>\
to be applied to The فَرْغَانِ with the stars around<br>\

sought: (S, O:) and in like manner one says,<br>\
ذَهَبَتْ دِمَاؤُهُمْ فِرغًا [Their bloods went for nothing,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (Z, TA.) Hence, in the Kur xxviii. 9, accord. to one reading, وَأَصْبَحَ فُؤَادُ أُمِّ مُوسَى فِرْغًا<br>\
(Ksh and Bd) i. e. And the heart, or mind, of<br>\
the mother of Moses became [as though it were]<br>\
a thing that was lost, or that had gone away.<br>\
