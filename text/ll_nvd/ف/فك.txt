of these explanations, [which most nearly denotes<br>\
the meaning intended,] it is as though one said,<br>\
قَاتِلُ الرَّجُلِ بَيْنَ فَكَّيْهِ. (Meyd. [See Freytag&#39;s<br>\

explanation but one, where it is mentioned as an<br>\
inf. n.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (K) A state of dislocation of the<br>\
foot: (S, O, K:) hence the phrase, in a verse of<br>\
Ru-beh, كَمُنْهَاضِ الفَلَكٌ: (S, O: *) but (in this<br>\
instance, O), accord. to As, الفَلَك is used by<br>\
poetic license for الفَكّ [meaning “ the jaw,” so<br>\

(S, O: *) or very foolish, or stupid: (IAar, K,<br>\
TA:) and you say فَاكٌّ تَاكٌّ, (IAar, S, O, TA,)<br>\
making تاكّ an imitative sequent: or, accord. to<br>\
Yaakoob, you say شَيْخٌ فَاكٌّ وَتَاكٌّ: thus he makes<br>\
تاكّ a substitute, not an imitative sequent. (TA.)<br>\
And أَحْمَقُ فَاكٌّ وَهَاكٌّ (tropical:)  [A foolish, or stupid,<br>\
person,] one who talks of that which he knows<br>\

in its meaning a pret.: (O:) Az says that it is<br>\
not from مَا انْفَكَّ meaning مَا زَالَ, but from اِنْفِكَاكُ<br>\
الشَّىْءِ مِنَ الشَّىْءِ meaning “ the thing&#39;s becoming<br>\
separated from the thing: ” accord. to IAar, as<br>\
mentioned by Th, فُكَّ فُلَانٌ means “ Such a one<br>\
was set free, and at rest, from a thing; ” and<br>\
hence منفكّين in the Kur means experiencing<br>\
rest: accord. to Er-Rághib, it means separated,<br>\
or separated into several parties; for all [to<br>\
whom the word, preceded by a negative, relates]<br>\
were assenting to error. (TA.)<br>\
