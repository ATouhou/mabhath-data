فَانَ, aor. يَفِينُ, (K,) inf. n. فَيْنٌ, (TA,) He,<br>\
or it, came. (K.)<br>\
فَيْنَةٌ A time; syn. وَقْتٌ, or وَقْتٌ مِنَ الزَّمَانِ;<br>\
(T;) or حِينٌ; (T, S, M, K;) and سَاعَةٌ. (S,<br>\
K.) You say, لَقِيتُهُ الفَيْنَةَ بَعْدَ الفَيْنَةِ [I met him<br>\
time after time]: (AZ, S, M, K; but some copies<br>\
of the K omit the words بعد الفينة:) and لَقِيتُهُ فَيْنَةَ<br>\
[I met him at a certain time]: (AZ, S, M, K;<br>\
but in some copies of the S and K, فَيْنَةً:) thus<br>\
فينة is made determinate in two different ways;<br>\
by its having the article ال prefixed to it [in the<br>\
former case], and as a proper name [in the latter<br>\
case; with which compare what is said of بُكْرَةَ<br>\
&amp;c.]: (AZ, M:) and you say, إِنِّى لَآتِى فُلَانًا<br>\
الفَيْنَةَ بَعْدَ الفَيْنَةِ i. e. [Verily I come to such a one]<br>\
time after time; not continually repairing to him:<br>\
(AZ, T:) and, accord. to ISk, مَا أَلْقَاهُ إِلَّا الفَيْنَةَ<br>\
i. e. [I do not meet him save occasionally, or] time<br>\
after time. (TA.) [See also فَنَّةٌ.]<br>\
فَيْنَان Having beautiful and long hair: (K:)<br>\
or so فَيْنَانُ الشَّعَرِ; applied to a man: (S:) فَيْنَان<br>\
[is also applied as an epithet to hair; and] has<br>\
been mentioned in art. فن q. v.: (K:) if it be<br>\
from فَنَنٌ, meaning “ a branch,” it is [of the<br>\
measure فَيْعَالٌ, and therefore] perfectly decl. when<br>\
indeterminate, and likewise when determinate [as<br>\
a proper name]; but if from فَيْنَةٌ, meaning “ a<br>\
time,” [which seems to be hardly reasonable,] it<br>\
is [of the measure فَعْلَان, and therefore] perfectly<br>\
decl. in the former case and imperfectly decl. in<br>\
the latter case. (Lh, T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also ظِلٌّ<br>\
فَيْنَانٌ, meaning Wide, extensive, shade. (TA.)<br>\
أَفْيُونٌ, also written أُفْيُونٌ and إِفْيَوْنٌ, held by<br>\
some to belong to this art. and by others to<br>\
belong to art. افن, has been mentioned in<br>\
page 70.<br>\
