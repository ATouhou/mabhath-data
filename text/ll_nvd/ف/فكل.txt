افتكل فِى فِعْلِهِ i. q. اِحْتَفَلَ [He strove,<br>\
laboured, or exerted himself, &amp;c., in his doing];<br>\
(IAar, O, K;) said of a man. (IAar, O.)<br>\
أَفْكَلُ A tremour, (S, O, K,) from cold or from<br>\
fear: (S:) hence, in a trad., أَخَذَنِى أَفْكَلُ [A<br>\
tremour seized me]: (S, * O:) and in another,<br>\
فَبَاتَ وَلَهُ أَفْكَلُ [And he passed the night having a<br>\
tremour, or shivering]: (O:) thus used, as indeterminate, it is perfectly decl.; but if used as a<br>\
[proper] name of a man, it is imperfectly decl.<br>\
because determinate and also of the measure of a<br>\
verb: (S, O:) some say, (IF, O,) no verb is<br>\
formed from it; (IF, S, O;) but such is not the<br>\
case, for they said رَجُلٌ مَفْكُولٌ [which shows that<br>\
it had a verb though none is known to have been<br>\
in use]. (IF, O.) [أَخَذَتْ بِى نَاقَتِى أَفْكَلًا مِنَ<br>\
السَّيْرِ is a saying mentioned in the O and K, (in<br>\
the former as from Ibn-&#39;Abbád,) but the meaning<br>\
is not expl., nor indicated by the context, in either<br>\
of them; and the strangeness of its phraseology<br>\
convinces me that it presents a mistranscription:<br>\
I believe that the first word is mistranscribed for<br>\
أَحْدَثَتْ, and, consequently, that the meaning is,<br>\
My she-camel produced in me a tremour arising<br>\
from the rate of journeying: some copies of the<br>\
K, as is stated in the TA, for مِنَ السَّيْرِ, have من<br>\
السَّبْقِ, from the outstripping.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The [bird<br>\
commonly called] شِقِرَّاق [generally meaning the<br>\
green wood-pecker]; (O, K;) because they regard<br>\
it as of evil omen; so that when it presents itself<br>\
to them, they are frightened at it, and tremble.<br>\
(O.)<br>\
-A2-  And A company, or collective body, of<br>\
men: one says, جَاؤُوا بِأَفْكَلِهِمْ They came with<br>\
their company [i. e. all together]. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,<br>\
K.) أَفَاكِيلُ [is app. a pl. thereof, and, as such,]<br>\
signifies أَفْوَاجٌ [pl. of فَوْجٌ, q. v.]: thus in the<br>\
phrase أَفَاكِيلُ مِنْ كَذَا [app. meaning Multitudes of such a kind of thing]: (K:) [or] thus in<br>\
the saying, mentioned by Ibn-&#39;Abbád, عِنْدَهُ أَفَاكِيلُ<br>\
مِنْ كَلَامٍ [app. meaning He has multitudes of<br>\
sayings, or words; for كَلَامٌ (q. v.) is used in a<br>\
pl. sense as well as in a sing. sense]. (O. [The<br>\
difference of these two exs. in respect of the last<br>\
word suggests that there may be in one of them<br>\
a mistranscription.])<br>\
مَفْكُولٌ [the pass. part. n. of a verb which is not<br>\
mentioned,] Affected with a tremour. (IF, O, K,<br>\
TA. [See أَفْكَلُ, first sentence.])<br>\
