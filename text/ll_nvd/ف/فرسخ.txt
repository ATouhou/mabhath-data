the S], (K,) [A parasang, or league;] three<br>\
Háshimee miles (أَمْيَال هَاشِمِيَّة [see مِيلٌ]): or<br>\
twelve thousand cubits: or ten thousand cubits:<br>\
(K:) three miles of the Háshimee measure, i. e.,<br>\
accord. to the Bári&#39; and the T [&amp;c.], twenty-five<br>\
bow-shots; twenty-five times the measure termed<br>\
غَلْوَةٌ [q. v.]: (Msb:) or three miles, i. e. thirty<br>\
bow-shots reckoning the bow-shot as four hundred<br>\
cubits, or sixty bow-shots reckoning the bow-shot<br>\
as two hundred cubits: (Msb voce مَيلٌ:) the<br>\
ancient Greeks said that it is three miles, reckoning these [together] as about sixty bow-shots [of<br>\
the shorter measure mentioned above]: (Msb in<br>\
the present art.:) or, accord. to some, six miles:<br>\
(L: [but this is app. a mistake occasioned by<br>\
finding it expl. as consisting of sixty bow-shots<br>\
and supposing these to be bow-shots of four hundred cubits each:]) it is [said to be] from the<br>\
same word as signifying “ rest,” or “ ease; ” (K,<br>\
TA;) because, when a man walks the distance<br>\
thus called, he sits down, and rests: or, accord.<br>\
to the Msb, from فَرْسَخَةٌ signifying “ width; ” the<br>\
word having this meaning, however, is فَرْشَخَةٌ,<br>\
with ش: (TA:) [the truth is, that] it is a Pers.<br>\
word [فَرْسَنْگ], arabicized: (S, A:) the pl. is<br>\
فَرَاسِخُ. (S, A, Msb.) The other meanings of<br>\
this word, not mentioned by J, may have been<br>\
regarded by him as not of established authority.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It signifies also An opening, or intervening space, between two things. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
A thing in which is no opening, or intervening<br>\
space: as though having two contr. significations. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also A thing that is lasting and<br>\
abundant, that does not cease, or come to an end.<br>\
(ISh, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And A long time (K, TA) of the<br>\
night or of the day: thus in the saying, اِنْتَظَرْتُكَ<br>\
فَرْسَخًا [I looked, or waited, for thee, or I have<br>\
looked, &amp;c., a long time &amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And A<br>\
سَاعَة [meaning hour or time] (K, TA) of the day:<br>\
or a time of the night and of the day: pl. as<br>\
above. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And The time, (K, TA,) or<br>\
interval, (TA,) between stillness and motion. (K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And Stillness, or quiet: (K, TA:) a<br>\
meaning mentioned by more than one of the<br>\
authorities respecting strange words. (TA.) ―<br>\

And Rest, or ease. (K.)<br>\
