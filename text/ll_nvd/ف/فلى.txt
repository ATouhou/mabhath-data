فَلَى رأْسَهُ, (M, Mgh, K,) and ثِيَابَهُ, (Mgh,)<br>\
[aor.<br>\
فَلِىَ,] inf. n. فَلْىٌ; (M, Mgh;) and رَأْسَهُ ↓ فلّى<br>\
also; (K; [but not in my copy of the TA;])<br>\
He searched his head, (M, Mgh, K,) and his<br>\
clothes, (Mgh,) for lice: (M, Mgh, K:) [and it<br>\
appears from an explanation below (see 8) that<br>\
افتلى رَأْسَهُ perhaps signifies the same:] or one<br>\
says, فَلَيْتُ رَأْسَهُ مِنَ القَمْلِ [I searched his head<br>\
for lice]: (S:) or فَلَيْتُ رَأْسِى, aor. as above, and<br>\
so the inf. n., signifies I cleared my head of lice.<br>\
(Msb.) [See also الفِلَآءُ, below.] In the saying<br>\
of &#39;Amr Ibn-Maadee-kerib,<br>\
تَرَاهُ كَالثَّغَامِ يُغَلُّّ مِسْكًا<br>\
يَسْوْءُ الفَالِيَاتِ إِذَا فَلَيْنِى<br>\
[Thou seest it (meaning the white hair intermixing<br>\
with black) like the thagham (the plant so called)<br>\
inserted in musk, grieving the lousing women when<br>\
they louse me], فَلَيْنِى is for فَلَيْنَنِى, (T, S,) the two<br>\
ن being deemed difficult of utterance; (T;) as<br>\
Akh says, he has rejected the latter ن because it<br>\
is merely a preservative to the verb [lest its affix<br>\
should be supposed to form an essential part of<br>\
it], whereas the former ن may not be rejected,<br>\
because it is the pronoun of the verb. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] فَلَى الشِّعْرَ, (ISk, T, S, K,) aor. and inf.<br>\
n. as above, (TA,) (tropical:)  He considered, and endeavoured to understand, the poetry, and elicited<br>\
its meanings, (ISk, T, S, K, TA,) and what was<br>\
strange of it: (ISk, S, TA:) or, accord. to the<br>\
A, he investigated the meanings of the poetry:<br>\
one says, اِفْلِ هٰذَا البَيْتَ فَإِنَّهُ صَعْبٌ (tropical:)  [Investigate<br>\
thou the meaning of this verse, for it is difficult].<br>\
(TA.) [Freytag has mentioned فَلَا, in art. فلو,<br>\
as signifying “ Disquisivit,” and as followed by<br>\
عن; from the Deewán of the Hudhalees.] And<br>\
فَلَى الأَمْرَ (assumed tropical:)  He considered, or examined, the various<br>\
modes of the affair, or case, endeavouring to obtain<br>\
a clear knowledge of them, and looked to its result. (T, TA.) And فَلَيْتُ القُومَ بِعَيْنِى (assumed tropical:)  [I examined the people, or party, with my eye, in order<br>\
to know them]: and فَلَيْتُ خَبَرَهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [I examined<br>\
their state, or case, in order to know it]. (TA.)<br>\
And فَلَاهُ فِى عَقْلِهِ, (T, M, K, TA,) aor. as above,<br>\
(T, TA,) and so the inf. n., (M, TA,) (tropical:)  He looked,<br>\
or examined, to see what was his intelligence: (T,<br>\
TA:) or he tried, or tested, him, in respect of his<br>\
intelligence. (M, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  فَلَيْتُ القَوْمَ I entered amid the breaks, or interspaces, of the people;<br>\
(T, TA; *) as also فَلَوْتُهُمْ; (T;) and so ↓ أَفْلَيْتُهُمْ.<br>\
(TA.) And فَلَى المَفَازَةَ He passed through the<br>\
مفازة [i. e. desert, or waterless desert]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
فَلَاهُ بَالسَّيْفِ, aor. يَفْلِيهِ, (K, TA,) inf. n. فَلْىٌ, (TA,)<br>\
signifies the same as فَلَاهُ, aor. يَفْلُوهُ, (K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. فَلْوٌ. (TA.) See the latter verb in art. فلو.<br>\
-A2-  فَلِىَ i. q. اِنْقَطَعَ [It, or he, was cut, or cut off,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (IAar, T, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
فَلَّىَ see the first sentence above.<br>\
4<br>\
أَفْلَىَ see 1, near the end of the paragraph.<br>\
5<br>\
تفلّى He applied himself, as to a task, to<br>\
the act of searching his head for lice. (T, * M,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تفالت الحُمُرُ The asses scratched, scraped,<br>\
or rubbed, one another; as though they were<br>\
lousing one another. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 10.<br>\
8<br>\
يَفْتَلُونَ الفَلَاةَ, (T,) or المَكَانَ, (K, *) (tropical:)  They<br>\
depasture the herbage (T, K *) of the فلاة [or<br>\
desert, or waterless desert, &amp;c.], (T,) or of the place,<br>\
(K,) and seek for the portions of herbage that are<br>\
beginning to dry up therein; like as [is done when]<br>\
the head is searched for lice (كَمَا يُفْتَلَى الرَّأْسُ or<br>\
كما يُفْلَى الرأس accord. to two transcripts from<br>\
the T). (T in arts. فلو and فلى of the TT.)<br>\
[This meaning of the verb is expl. (imperfectly)<br>\
in art. فلو, to which it does not belong.]<br>\
10<br>\
استفلى رَأْسَهُ, and ↓ تفالى, (S, K,) i. e. تفالى<br>\
هُوَ [not تفالى رأسه], (S,) He desired that his head<br>\
might be searched for lice. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  And استفلاهُ<br>\
He exposed himself to have his head struck and<br>\
cut with the sword: (M, TA:) a poet says,<br>\
أَمَاتَرَانِى رَابِطَ الجَنَانِ<br>\
أَفْلِيهِ بِالسَّيْفِ إِذَا اسْتَفْلَانِى<br>\
[Dost thou not see me to be strong of heart? I<br>\
will strike and cut his head with the sword when<br>\
he exposes himself to be so struck &amp;c.]<br>\
[<br>\
فِلْيَةٌ, mentioned in this art. by Freytag, with<br>\
فَلَالِىٌّ as its pl., is taken by him from a mistranscription in the CK in art. فل: see فِلِّيَّةٌ in that<br>\
art.]<br>\
الفلَآءُ, like كِسَآء [in measure], means فلآء الشعر,<br>\
[evidently, I think, فِلَآءُ الشَّعَرَ, or the first word<br>\
may be a mistranscription for فَلْىُ,] i. e. اخذك ما<br>\
فيه [lit. Thy taking what is in it, in which “ it ”<br>\
refers to the شعر: app. a euphemism for the taking<br>\
of lice from the hair: if so, it may be an inf. n.,<br>\
like فَلْىٌ; (see 1, first sentence;) or it may be a<br>\
simple subst., like what here follows]: mentioned<br>\
by IAmb, from his companions. (TA.)<br>\
فِلَايَةٌ [The act of searching the head for lice;]<br>\
the subst. from فَلَى رَأْسَهُ signifying “ he searched<br>\
his head for lice. ” (Lth, * T, * K.) [See also the<br>\
next preceding paragraph.]<br>\
[<br>\
فَالٍ act. part. n. of 1: fem. فَالِيَةٌ.] فَالِيَاتٌ and<br>\
فَوَالٍ [are pls. of فَالِيَةٌ and] signify Women who<br>\
search the head for lice. (T, TA.) See an ex. of<br>\
the former pl. in the verse cited in the first paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  فَالِيَةُ الأَفَاعِى (in which the former word<br>\
is a pl. [in meaning], M, TA) signifies [lit. The<br>\
lousers of the vipers; meaning,] accord. to the A,<br>\
certain species of the kind [of beetles] called خَنَافِس<br>\
[pl. of خُنْفَسَآء], speckled, found at the holes of the<br>\
serpents, which they louse: (TA:) or a certain<br>\
خنفسآء, speckled (M, K) with [the colour termed]<br>\
صُحْمَة, which is found at the holes [of serpents &amp;c.],<br>\
and is the mistress of خَنَافِس; (M;) which is<br>\
familiar with scorpions and serpents; so that<br>\
when it comes forth from a hole [thereof], it makes<br>\
known their existence [therein]: (K:) or certain<br>\
small things like خنَافس, speckled; which are<br>\
familiar with scorpions and serpents; so that when<br>\
they are seen in the hole [thereof] it is known that<br>\
behind them are scorpions and serpents: (T:) or<br>\
certain insects (دَوَابُّ) that are found at the holes<br>\
of the [lizards called] ضِبَاب [pl. of ضَبُّ]; so that<br>\
when they come forth, it is known that the ضَبّ is<br>\
coming forth inevitably. (M.) Hence one says,<br>\
اتتكم فَالِيَةُ الأَفَاعِى, (IAar, T, M, K, *) meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The beginning of evil to be looked for [has come<br>\
to you], (IAar, T,) or the beginnings of evil [hare<br>\
come to you]; (K;) which is a prov. (IAar, T.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence] اِبْنُ الفَوَالِى means The جَانّ; i. e.<br>\
the serpent [so called]. (T in art. بنى.)<br>\
فَالِيَةٌ [fem. of فَالٍ, q. v. ―<br>\
-b2-  And also] A knife.<br>\
