تَفْئِيلٌ is of the measure تَفْعِيلٌ from الفَأْلُ:<br>\
(O, K, * TA: *) [and is app. syn. with تَفَأُّلٌ, signifying The auguring, &amp;c.; or it may signify the<br>\
auguring, &amp;c., much: accord. to the TK, فَأَّلَهُ بِهِ<br>\
means جَعَلَهُ يَتَفَأَّلُ بِهِ he made him to augur, &amp;c.,<br>\
by it; but this, as is very often the case in the<br>\
TK, is app. said only on the ground of conjecture:<br>\
the only ex. that I have found, to show its true<br>\
meaning, is that which here follows:] Ru-beh<br>\
says,<br>\
لَا يَأْخُذُ التَّفْئِيلُ وَالتَّحَزِّى<br>\
فِينَا وَلَا قَذْفُ العِدَى ذُو الأَزِّ<br>\
[which seems evidently to mean, The auguring,<br>\
&amp;c., or auguring, &amp;c., much, and the divining,<br>\
will not have any effect upon us; nor the enemies&#39;<br>\
noisy reviling or reproaching]: but AA has related it otherwise, substituting التَّأْفِيكُ [lit. the<br>\
lying] for التفئيل; and has explained it as meaning the enchanting; because it is a turning of a<br>\
thing from its proper way, or mode. (O, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تفأّل بِهِ, (ISk, S, M, MA,) or ↓ تفآءل, (AZ,<br>\
T, Msb,) or both, (K, TA, [accord. to the latter<br>\
of which, it seems that the latter v. is formed<br>\
from the former v., for the purpose of alleviating<br>\
the pronunciation, and has become the popular<br>\
form,]) He augured, or augurated, good, by it,<br>\
or from it; or regarded it as a good omen; i. e.,<br>\
something uttered in his hearing: (AZ, ISk, T,<br>\
S, M, * MA, Msb, K:) or so, and likewise evil;<br>\
(AZ, T, Msb, K;) accord. to the usage of some<br>\
of the Arabs: (T:) [but in the latter case they<br>\
generally said, تَطِيَّرَ مِنْهُ (q. v.): and in like<br>\
manner they used these verbs in relation to the<br>\
cries and flights of birds, and the motions of<br>\
gazelles, &amp;c.; as is stated in several of the lexicons, voce بَارِحٌ, &amp;c. See also 2 and 8: and see<br>\
فَأْلٌ.]<br>\

اِفْتِئَالٌ [in my copies of the S written اِفْتِيَال]<br>\
is of the measure اِفْتِعَالٌ from الفَأْلُ: (S, K, *<br>\
TA: *) [in the PS and TK, it is said to be syn.<br>\
with تَفَأُّلٌ: it seems, however, that in the ex. here<br>\
following, its exact signification, and whether it<br>\
be used in an act. or a pass. sense, is doubtful;<br>\
and that it is trans. without a prep.:] El-Kumeyt<br>\
says, describing horses,<br>\
إِذَا مَا بدَتْ تَحْتَ الخَوَافِقِ صَدَّقَتْ<br>\
بِأَيْمَنِ فَأْلِ الزَّاجِرِينَ افْتِئَالُهْا<br>\
[app. meaning, When they appear beneath the<br>\
standards, (perhaps standards set up as winningposts,) the regarding them as of good omen, or<br>\
their being regarded as of good omen, (by reason<br>\
of their excellent performance,) verifies the happiest<br>\
augury of the diviners: with respect to its being<br>\
made fem. in this ex., though not regularly fem.<br>\
in form, see صَرْفٌ, third sentence]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[It has also another signification:] Fr says,<br>\
اِفْتَأَلْتُ الرَّأْىَ is with hemz which is originally [a<br>\
letter] other than hemz [app. meaning that the v.<br>\
is originally اِفْتَيَلْتُ, which becomes changed by<br>\
rule to اِفْتَلْتُ; and that the signification is the<br>\
same as that of فَيَّلْتُ الرَّأْىَ, I declared, or<br>\
esteemed, the judgment, or opinion, weak; or pronounced it to be bad, and wrong, or erroneous:<br>\
perhaps the substitution of hemz for the medial<br>\
radical letter is for the purpose of giving to the<br>\
phrase a double meaning: or the hemz may be<br>\
the original letter, and the phrase may be used<br>\
ironically]. (O, TA.)<br>\
فَأْلٌ, (T, S, M, O, Msb, K,) and فَالٌ without<br>\
ء is allowable, (Msb,) A good omen; (PS;) contr.<br>\
of طِيَرَةٌ: (T, M, Msb, K:) it is when a man is<br>\
sick, and he hears another say يَا سَالِمُ [O safe];<br>\
or seeking, and hears another say يَا وَاجِدُ [O<br>\
finder]: (ISk, T, S, O, K: *) or it is when one<br>\
hears a good saying, and augurs good by it:<br>\
(Msb:) [therefore] it is said in a trad., كَانَ<br>\
يُحِبُّ الفَأْلَ وَيَكْرَهُ الطِّيَرَةَ [He (the Prophet) used<br>\
to like the فأل, and dislike the طِيَرَة]: (T, S, O:)<br>\
[or it signifies so, and likewise an evil omen: i. e.]<br>\
it is used in relation to a good saying and to an<br>\
evil saying, (AZ, T, Msb, K,) by some of the<br>\
Arabs: (T:) it is said in a trad. [of the Prophet],<br>\
يُعْجِبُنِى الفَأْلُ الصَّالِحُ [The good فأل pleases me];<br>\
which shows that there is a sort of فأل that is<br>\
good and a sort that is not good: (TA:) and<br>\
[in like manner] طَائِرٌ is applied to that which is<br>\
good and that which is evil: (K in art. طير:)<br>\
the pl. is أَفْؤُلٌ [properly a pl. of pauc.], (S, O,)<br>\
or فُؤُولٌ [a pl. of mult.], (M,) or both: (K:)<br>\
El-Kumeyt says,<br>\
وَلَا أَسْأَلُ الطَّيْرَ عَمَّا تَقُولُ<br>\
وَلَا تَتَخَالَجُنِى الأَفْؤُلُ<br>\
[And I will not ask the birds respecting what they<br>\
say, nor shall omens, or good omens, contend with<br>\
me as though pulling me in different directions].<br>\
(S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  لَا فَأْلَ عَلَيْكَ means No harm shall<br>\
befall thee; (T, O, K;) and no evil fortune; and<br>\
no mischief. (T.)<br>\
فَئِلُ اللَّحْمِ, (O, K,) or اللَّحْمِ ↓ فَيْأَلُ, (T,) or<br>\
both, (TA,) A man having much flesh. (T, O, K,<br>\
TA.) [See also فَيِّلٌ, in art. فيل.]<br>\
الفِئَالُ A certain game of the boys (T, S, O, K,<br>\
TA) of the desert-Arabs, (TA,) with earth, or<br>\
dust: (T:) they hide a thing in earth, or dust,<br>\
and then divide it, and say, In which of them<br>\
(S, O, K, TA) twain (S, O, TA) is it? (S, O,<br>\
K, TA.) [See also الفَيَالُ, in art. فيل.]<br>\
فَيْأَلُ اللَّحْمِ: see فَئِلُ اللَّحْمِ, above.<br>\
مُفَائِلٌ [or مُفَايِلٌ (M and TA in art. فيل)] A<br>\
boy playing at the game called الفِئَال. (S, O. *)<br>\
