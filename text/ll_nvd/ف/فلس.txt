فلّسهُ, (S, A, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَفْلِيسٌ, (S,<br>\
O, Msb, K,) He (a judge) proclaimed him. (S,<br>\
A, O, Msb,) or pronounced him, (O, K,) to be,<br>\
or to have become, in a state of إِفْلَاس [meaning<br>\
bankruptcy, or insolvency], (S, A, O, K,) or to<br>\
have become مُفْلِس [meaning bankrupt, or insolvent], and paraded him among the people as such.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] one says, فُلِّسَ مِنْ كُلِّ<br>\
خَيْرٍ [app. meaning He was pronounced destitute<br>\
of all good, or of all property]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [فُلِّسَ<br>\

افلس, [inf. n. إِفْلَاسٌ,] He became مُفْلِس<br>\
[which in the common legal acceptation means<br>\
bankrupt, or insolvent]: (S:) or he had no property remaining: (O, K:) as though his دَرَاهِم<br>\
[or pieces of silver] had become فُلُوس [or small<br>\
copper coins], (S, O, K,) and base money: like<br>\
as أَخْبَثَ signifies “ his companions, or friends,<br>\
became bad, wicked, or deceitful: ” (S, O:) or<br>\
he became in such a state that it was said he had<br>\
not a فَلْس [or small copper coin]; (S, O, K;)<br>\
like as أَقْهَرَ signifies “ he became in a state in<br>\
which to be overcome, or subdued: ” (S, O:) or<br>\
as though he became in a state in which to be<br>\
overcome, or subdued: (Msb:) or he became a<br>\
possessor of فُلُوس after he had been a possessor of<br>\
دَرَاهِم: (M, Msb:) but properly, [so in the Msb,<br>\
but I would rather say secondarily, or tropically,]<br>\
he became reduced from a state of ease, or competence, or richness, to a state of difficulty, or<br>\
poverty. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  افلس الرَّجُلَ He sought the<br>\

فُلُوس is the common term for Money in Egypt<br>\

failure of finding him whom [or that which] one<br>\
seeks. (TA.) You say, وَقَعَ فِى فَلَسٍ شَدِيدٍ [He<br>\
fell into a severe state of indigence or destitution].<br>\
(TA.) And one says, فِى حُبِّهَا فَلَسٌ, meaning<br>\
With her love, or the love of her, is no obtainment:<br>\
and the phrase حُبُّهَا فَلَسٌ, occurring in a verse of<br>\
El-Mo&#39;attal El-Hudhalee, or of Aboo-Kilábeh,<br>\
[in which the love thus described is afterwards<br>\
termed ↓ حُبُّ مُفْلِسٌ, so that فَلَسٌ is here used for<br>\
مُفْلِسٌ, or the phrase is elliptical,] Her love, or<br>\
the love of her, is such that nothing is obtained<br>\
from it. (O.)<br>\
