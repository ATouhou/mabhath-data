فَنَكَ بِالمَكَانِ, [aor.<br>\
فَنُكَ, (TK,)] inf. n. فُنُوكٌ, He<br>\
remained, stayed, dwelt, or abode, in the place.<br>\
(El-Umawee, S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  فَنَكَ فِى الأَمْرِ, (S, O,<br>\
K, *) aor. as above, (S,) and so the inf. n., (S, O,)<br>\
He persisted, or persevered, in the affair; (S,<br>\
O, K; *) as also ↓ افنك. (K.) [See also فَتَكَ;<br>\
and see other explanations below.] And فَنَكَ فِى<br>\
الكَذِبِ He persisted, or persevered, in lying: asserted by Yaakoob to be formed by transposition<br>\
from فَكَنَ: and Aboo-Tálib says that ↓ فانك and<br>\
↓ فنّك, of which latter the inf. n. is تَفْنِيكٌ, signify<br>\
he persisted, or persevered, in lying, and in evil;<br>\
not in good; and denote the like of consecutiveness. (TA.) [See also فَنْكٌ, which may be an<br>\
inf. n. of فَنَكَ in this sense, and in others.] And<br>\
فَنَكَ عَلَيْهِ, (K, TA,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) signifies [in like manner] He kept, or applied himself, constantly, perseveringly, or assiduously, to it;<br>\
as also ↓ افنك. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فَنَكَ فِى الطَّعَامِ,<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, S, O, K,) aor. as above, (S,) and so<br>\
the inf. n., (S, O,) He continued constantly,<br>\
uniformly, or regularly, in the eating of the food,<br>\
not loathing aught thereof; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, S, O,<br>\
K;) as also فَنِكَ, (S, O, K,) with kesr, (S, O,)<br>\
like عَلِمَ, (K,) inf. n. فُنُوكٌ; (S, O, K;) and so<br>\
↓ فانك: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K:) and الطَّعَامَ ↓ فَانَكْتُ<br>\
وَالشَّرَابَ signifies [simply] I kept continually, or<br>\
constantly, to the food and the beverage: and also<br>\
I loathed them, or turned away from them with<br>\
disgust. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And فَنَكَ فِى الأَمْرِ<br>\
[not فانك as in the lexicons of Golius and Freytag,<br>\
the latter of whom gives both forms of the v. in<br>\
the sense here following, as does also the TK,]<br>\
signifies also He entered into the affair. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And He mastered the affair, and overcame it.<br>\
(O.) ―<br>\
-b6-  فَنَكْتَ فِى لَوْمِى, and فيه ↓ افنكت, (both<br>\
in the TA, but the latter only in the O,) Thou<br>\
wast, or hast become, skilled in the blaming, or<br>\
censuring, of me, and profuse, or immoderate,<br>\
therein: so says Fr. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And فَنَكَتْ<br>\
and ↓ أَفْنَكَتْ She (a woman) blamed, or censured,<br>\
and kept continually, or constantly, to blaming, or<br>\
censuring, or to some other thing [or act]. (Lth,<br>\
O, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b8-  And the former, said of a girl, or<br>\
young woman, She cared not for what she did<br>\
nor for what was said to her. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,<br>\
K.) This meaning has also been assigned to<br>\
فَتَكَتْ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And فَنَكَ, (K,) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(TA,) He lied, or said what was untrue; as also<br>\
↓ افنك. (K.)<br>\

3<br>\
فَاْنَكَ see 1, first quarter: and near the middle,<br>\
in two places.<br>\
4<br>\
أَفْنَكَ see 1, in five places.<br>\
فَنْكٌ i. q. عَجَبٌ: (IAar, O, K, TA:) [it app.<br>\
means A wonderful thing: for] IAar cites as an ex.,<br>\
وَلَا فَنْكَ إِلَّا سَعْىُ عَمْرٍو وَرَهْطِهِ<br>\
بِمَا اخْتَشَبُوا مِنْ مِعْضَدٍ وَدَدَانِ<br>\
[And there is not anything wonderful except the<br>\
conduct of &#39;Amr and his near kinsfolk in their<br>\
having taken without selection a sword commonly<br>\
used for lopping trees, and one that was blunt]:<br>\
(TA:) and ↓ فَنَكٌ signifies the same. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Persistence, or perseverence; or the act<br>\
of persisting, or persevering. (TA.) [In this and<br>\
the following senses, it seems to be an inf. n. of<br>\
which the verb is فَنَكَ; as is indicated in the TA.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And The act of overcoming. (O, K, TA.<br>\
[Accord. to the TA, from IAar; but said in the<br>\
O to be from another, not there named.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
The acting wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or<br>\
tyrannically. (IAar, O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And The<br>\
lying, or saying what is untrue. (IAar, O, K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
فَنَكٌ A certain beast, (Kr, O, K,) of the skin of<br>\
which the furred garment is made; (Kr, S, O;)<br>\
[the marten;] the furred garment whereof is the<br>\
best sort of such garments, and the highest in estimation, and the most equable, and is suitable to<br>\
all temperate constitutions: (K:) it is said to be<br>\
a species of the Turkish fox&#39;s cubs; and therefore<br>\
Az and others say that the word is arabicized;<br>\
some of the travellers relate that it is applied to<br>\
the young-one of the jackal (اِبْن آوَى) in the<br>\
country of the Turks: (Msb:) it is also said to<br>\
mean a certain skin that is worn; and to be an<br>\
arabicized word: [in Pers. a furred garment is<br>\
called فَنَك:] IDrd says, “I do not think it to be<br>\
Arabic: ” and MF mentions ↓ فَنِيكٌ as signifying<br>\
an animal like the fox; an arabicized word; from<br>\
[a work entitled] غَايَة البَيَان; and he says that it<br>\
appears to be the فَنَك that is mentioned in the K.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also فَنْكٌ.<br>\
الفَنِيكُ The مَجْمَع [or part in which is the symphysis] of the لَحْيَانِ [or two lateral portions of<br>\
the lower jaw], (Lth, O, K, TA,) in the middle of<br>\
the chin, (Lth, O, TA,) of a man; (Lth, O, K,<br>\
TA;) this is when the word is used in the sing.<br>\
form; (Lth, O; [see also الفَكُّ;]) and it is also<br>\
called ↓ الإِفْنِيكُ; (Lth, O;) [and in like manner<br>\
Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee explained what is<br>\
meant by the upper فَنِيك as is stated by IF and<br>\
in the O:] or the extremity [of each] of the<br>\
لَحْيَانِ, at the place of the عَنْفَقَة [or tuft of hair<br>\
that is between the lower lip and the chin;] (S, K;)<br>\
also called ↓ الإِفْنِيكُ; but Ks knew not this: (S:)<br>\
or the فَنِيكَانِ are the two extremities of the عَنْفَقَة:<br>\
(O:) or (K, TA, in the CK “ and ”) the sing.<br>\
signifies a bone [beneath the temple,] to which the<br>\
shaving of the head reaches (عَظْمٌ يَنْتَهِى إِلَيْهِ حَلْقُ<br>\
الرَّأْسِ): (K, TA:) and accord. to Lth, the dual<br>\
signifies the two extremities of the [lower] jaw, of<br>\
whatever has a jaw, that move in the act of chewing, below the temples: (O:) or, accord. to Sh,<br>\
the two thin, rising bones, [app. the two coronoid<br>\
processes of the jaw,] lower than the ears, between<br>\
the temple and the ball of the cheek. (TA.) The<br>\
lower فَنِيك is [app. The symphysis of the pubes;<br>\
being] said by Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee to be<br>\
the part where the two hip-bones meet together:<br>\
(IF, O:) [hence, perhaps, and therefore it may<br>\
be erroneously,] the فنيك is said by AA to be the<br>\
root, or base, of the tail: (TA:) and it signifies,<br>\
as also ↓ الإِفْنِيكُ, (IDrd, O, K,) the زِمِكَّى, (K,)<br>\
or زِمِجَّى, [i. e. the place of growth, or the root,<br>\
or the whole, of the tail, of a bird, or] of a young<br>\
bird; as they assert; (IDrd, O;) but IDrd says,<br>\
“ I will not pronounce it to be correct: ” (O:)<br>\
and the dual signifies two bones cleaving together:<br>\
when, in the female pigeon, they are broken, she<br>\
does not retain her eggs [sufficiently], but excludes<br>\
them prematurely. (Lth, O.)<br>\
-A2-  See also فَنَكٌ.<br>\
الإِفْنِيكُ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
مُتَفَنِّكَةٌ A foolish, or stupid, woman. (Ibn-<br>\
