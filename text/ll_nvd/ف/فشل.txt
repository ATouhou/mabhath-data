فَشِلَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor<br>\
فَشَلَ, (O, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. فَشَلٌ; (S, O, Msb;) a verb of which exs.<br>\
occur in the Kur iii. 118 and viii. 48; and فَشَلَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
فَشُلَ; and فَشَلَ, aor.<br>\
فَشِلَ; two dial. vars., the<br>\
former of these agreeable with a reading of the<br>\
latter verse of the Kur-án, and the latter agreeable with a reading of the same verse by El-<br>\
Hasan El-Basree; (O;) He was, or became,<br>\
cowardly, (S, O, Msb, K,) and weak, (O, K,) or<br>\
weak-hearted, (Msb,) and flagging, remiss, or<br>\
languid, (K,) and timorous. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  فَشَلَتْ, and<br>\
فَشَلَتْ مِفْشَلَهَا, (O,) or فَشَلَتْ فِشْلَهَا, (K, * TA, [in<br>\
the CK ↓ فَشَّلَتْهُ, the pronoun relating to الفِشْل,])<br>\
inf. n. فَشْلٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اِفْتَشَلَتْهُ, (O, K, * TA,)<br>\
thus accord. to the M as well as the O, (TA,)<br>\
i. e. مِفْشَلَهَا, (O,) or فِشْلَهَا; (TA;) [in the K<br>\
اِفْتَشَلَتْ alone, i. e. without any complement, as<br>\
though it were intrans.; or ↓ افشلت, which is<br>\
said in the TA to be the reading in the copies of<br>\
the K, but which I have not found in any;] and<br>\
↓ تفشّلت [mentioned without any complement, as<br>\
though intrans.]; (K, TA;) said of a woman,<br>\
(O, K, TA,) in relation to the فِشْل, (K,) which<br>\
is also called مِفْشَل, (IAar, O,) meaning She<br>\
hung a ثَوْب [or piece of cloth] (thus in the O,<br>\
in the TA her ثوب,) upon the [camel-vehicle<br>\
called] هَوْدَج, then put it [or drew it, or the main<br>\
part thereof,] within it, and bound its extremities<br>\
to the قَوَاعِد [or four pieces of wood that form a<br>\
square frame upon which it is fixed (see its sing.<br>\
قَاعِدَةٌ)]; this being [beneath her (see فِشْلٌ) so as<br>\
to be to her] a preservative from the heads of the<br>\
[curved pieces of wood called] أَحْنَآء [pl. of حِنْوٌ<br>\
q. v.] and the [apparatus called] أَقْتَاب [pl. of قِتْبٌ<br>\
q. v.] and the knots of the cord called عُصْم [pl. of<br>\
عِصَامٌ q. v.]: (O, TA:) so says ISh. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
فَشَّلَand 4: see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
5<br>\
تفشّل, said of water, It flowed. (S, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  And He took a wife (ISh, O, K) مِنْهُمْ [from<br>\
among them, probably meaning persons not of his<br>\
own kindred: see مِفْشَلٌ]. (ISh, O.)<br>\
-A3-  See also 1.<br>\
8<br>\
إِفْتَشَلَ see 1, latter sentence.<br>\
فَشْلٌ Weak; (S, O, K;) or weak-hearted;<br>\
(Msb;) cowardly; (S, Msb, K;) flagging, remiss,<br>\
or languid; (K;) and accord. to the K, ↓ فَشِلٌ signifies the same, and one says, رَجُلٌ خَشْلٌ فَشْلٌ<br>\
and ↓ خَشِلٌ فَشِلٌ; but [SM says that] this is a<br>\
mistake, and [incorrectly] taken from a passage<br>\
of the M, in which it is stated that one says رَجُلٌ<br>\
خَشْلٌ فَشْلٌ and خَسْل فَسْلٌ; i. e., with ش in both<br>\
and with س in both; not that it is with fet-h in<br>\
both and like كَتِفٌ: (TA:) [I find, however,<br>\
↓ خَشِلٌ فَشِلٌ mentioned in art. خشل in the K,<br>\
and also, as from Ibn-&#39;Abbád, in the same art. in<br>\
the O; and as ↓ فَشِلٌ is agreeable with a general<br>\
rule as part. n. of فَشِلَ, I think it probably correct;] the pl. is أَفْشَالٌ, (S,) or فُشْلٌ, (K,) or both.<br>\
(TA.) In the following verse, occurring in a<br>\
trad. respecting the prayer for rain, (O, TA,)<br>\
uttered to the Prophet by an Arab of the<br>\
desert, (O,)<br>\
وَلَا شَىْءَ مِمَّا يَأْكُلُ النَّاسُ عِنْدَنَا<br>\
سِوَى الحَنْظَلِ العَامِىِّ وَالعِلْهِزِ الفَشْلِ<br>\
by العِلْهِزِ الفَشْلِ is meant العِلْهِزِ الفَشْلِ آكِلُهُ<br>\
وَمُدَّخِرُهُ, i. e. الضَّعِيفِ; (O, TA; *) the phrase<br>\
being like الشَّجَرَةَ المَلْعُونَةَ in the Kur [xvii. 62],<br>\
i. e., آكِلُوهَا: [so that the verse means, And there<br>\
is nothing, of what men eat, in our possession, save<br>\
the colocynth that is a year old, and therefore dry,<br>\
or that has been laid up for the year of drought<br>\
or barrenness, and the food made of blood and the<br>\
fur of camels, the eater, and the storer, whereof<br>\
is weak]: (O, TA:) but it is also related with س,<br>\
[i. e. الفَسْلِ,] and thus does not need any paraphrastic interpretation. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also what<br>\
next follows.<br>\
فِشْلٌ (O, K,) or ↓ فَشْلٌ, (S,) [but said to be]<br>\
with kesr, (O, K,) A certain thing (S, K) of the<br>\
apparatus of the [women&#39;s camel-vehicle called]<br>\
هَوْدَج, (S,) which the woman puts beneath her in<br>\
the هودج: (K:) or the curtain (سِتْر) of the هودج;<br>\
as also ↓ مِفْشَلٌ. (IAar, O, K.) [See a description thereof in the latter sentence of the first paragraph.]<br>\
فَشِلٌ: see فَشْلٌ, in four places.<br>\
فَيْشِلٌ: see the paragraph here following.<br>\
الفَيْشَلَةُ The حَشَفَة; (K;) [i. e.] the head [or<br>\
glans] of the penis: (S, O:) and the head of any<br>\
مُحَوَّق [or penis having a large glans]: (CK: in<br>\
the text of the K as given in the TA, مُجَوَّف:<br>\
[and thus in my MS. copy of the K; but it has<br>\
been there altered, app. to agree with the TA, as<br>\
have many other words in that copy; and the<br>\
former reading is evidently, I think, the right:]<br>\
some say that its ل is augmentative, like the ل<br>\
in عَبْدَلٌ and in [the proper name] زَيْدَلٌ: but it<br>\
may be from some other word than فَيْشَةٌ, though<br>\
this has nearly the same meaning, [or, as is said<br>\
in the TA in art. فيش, both have the same meaning,] and, if so, the ى may be augmentative,<br>\
which is more agreeable with analogy: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. is فَيَاشِلُ, (K,) and ↓ فَيْشَلٌ is another pl.<br>\
[or rather a coll. gen. n.] thereof, used as such in<br>\
a verse of Jereer. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [The pl.] فَيَاشِلُ signifies also a name of Certain trees. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Freytag adds as other meanings what belong to<br>\
a description of the proper name of a certain<br>\
water and of hills surrounding it, called الفَيَاشِلُ.]<br>\
تَفْشِيلٌ Milk remaining in the udder: (Fr, O,<br>\
K:) and so تَمْشِيلٌ. (Fr, O.)<br>\
مِفْشَلٌ: see فِشْلٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also One who takes a wife<br>\
from among persons not of his own kindred, lest<br>\
the offspring should come forth spare in body, or<br>\
weak. (IAar, O, K, TA.)<br>\
مِفْشَلَةٌ The كيارجة [i. e. كَيَارِجَة], (ISh, TA,)<br>\
which is an arabicized word from the Pers. كراجه,<br>\
in Turkish قورسق [also written قُورْصَق, i. e. the<br>\
gizzard, or the crop, of a bird]. (TK voce مِشْفَلَةٌ<br>\
[which is said in the K to signify thus, and also<br>\
the stomach of a ruminant animal: one of the<br>\
two words thus expl. may be a mistranscription<br>\
for the other].)<br>\
