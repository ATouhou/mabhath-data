said of saffron: or, as some relate it, the verb in<br>\
that instance is ↓ افغى, which means it flowered,<br>\
or blossomed. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, said of seed-produce<br>\
(زَرْع), It dried, became dry, or dried up. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  فَغِىَ, aor. يَفْغَى, inf. n. فَغًا, said of dates (تَمْر),<br>\
i. q. حشف, [app. a mistranscription, unless there<br>\
be such as حَشِفَ, which seems to be not improbable, as one says تَمْرٌ حَشِفَ, and حَشَفٌ also; but<br>\
it can hardly be doubted that the meaning is,<br>\
They became bad, such as are termed حَشِفٌ or<br>\
حَشَفٌ, or, which is nearly the same, such as are<br>\
termed فَغًا]: so says Aboo-&#39;Alee El-Kálee. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
افغى It (a plant, S, [app., accord. to the K,<br>\
the plant حِنَّآء,]) put forth its فَاغَية [i. e. flower,<br>\
or blossom]. (S, K.) See also 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  افغت النَّخْلَةُ<br>\
The palm-tree became in a bad, or corrupt, state<br>\
[with respect to its fruit, as is implied in the S:<br>\
i. e. bore dates such as are termed غَفًا]. (S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence, app.,] افغى (said of a man, TA)<br>\
He became poor after being rich: and He became<br>\
ugly after being handsome: and He rebelled after<br>\
being obedient: (K, TA:) all from IAar: as<br>\
though his state became bad, or corrupt, like as<br>\
do unripe dates. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And, said of a man,<br>\
He kept constantly to the eating of فَغًا, (K, TA.)<br>\
i. e. unripe dates in an altered state. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
And افغى فُلَانًا He angered such a one. (K, TA.)<br>\
One says, مَاالَّذِى أَفْغَاكَ [What is it that angered<br>\
thee? or, hath angered thee?]. (TA.)<br>\
فَغْوٌ: see فَاغِيَةٌ.<br>\
فَغًا [or فَغًى] i. q. غَفًا [or غَفًى] in its several<br>\
meanings (K, TA) that have been mentioned [in<br>\
art. غفو and غفى]: and among these it has that<br>\
of The bad of anything. (TA.) And The [refuse<br>\
termed] حُثَالَة [q. v.] of wheat. (TA.) And A<br>\
dust that comes upon unripe dates, spoiling them,<br>\
and rendering them [in the skin] like the wings of<br>\
the [locusts, or the like, called] جَنَادِب [pl. of<br>\
جُنْدَب]. (TA.) And Unripe dates [themselves]<br>\
(S, TA) such as are bad and مُغْبَرّ [i. e. of a hue<br>\
like dust]; (S;) or such as are مُتَغَيِّر [i. e. altered<br>\
for the worse]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فَغَا الإِبِلِ The<br>\
small, or young, of camels. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And accord.<br>\
to the K, الفَغَا signifies العلبة والجفنةوَمَيَلٌ فِي<br>\
الفَمِ; but this is a mistake; correctly it signifies<br>\
مَيَلٌ فِى الفَمِ وَالعُلْبَةِ وَالجَفْنَةِ, meaning فِى العُلْبَةِ<br>\
وَالجَفْنَةِ [i. e. A distortion in the mouth, and in<br>\
the kinds of bowl called عُلْبَة and جَفْنَة], as expl.<br>\
by ISd: Kr says that it signifies a certain<br>\
malady, which ISd thinks to be a distortion in<br>\
the mouth, an explanation given by IAar. (TA.)<br>\
فَغْوَةُ الطِّيبِ The odour of perfume; like فَغْمَتُهُ:<br>\
(TA in art. فغم:) or the state of spreading of the<br>\
odour of perfume. (TA in the present art.)<br>\
فَاغِيَةٌ and ↓ فَغْوٌ The flower of the حِنَّآء [i. e. Lawsonia inermis, or Egyptian privet]; (Fr, S, K;)<br>\
as also فَاعِيَةٌ: (K in art. فعو or فعى:) or both<br>\
signify the flower, or blossom, of anything [i. e.<br>\
of any plant, or, app., of any fragrant plant:<br>\
see Ham p. 713]: or, as is said in a trad., the<br>\
فاغية is the prince, or chief, of the sweet-smelling<br>\
plants of Paradise: Sh says that ↓ الفَغْوُ signifies<br>\
نَوْر ورَائِحَة طَيِّبَة [a flower, or blossom; and a<br>\
sweet odour: but I think that we should read<br>\
نَوْرٌ ذُو رَائِحَةٍ طَيِّبَةٍ a sort of flower, or blossom,<br>\
having a sweet odour]: and IAar says that the<br>\
فاغية is the best and the most fragrant of sweetsmelling plants: (TA:) or it is the flower produced<br>\
by a branch of the حِنَّآء that has been planted inverted, and which is sweeter than [that of] the<br>\
[common] حِنَّآء. (K.)<br>\
