فَرِحَ, (S, A, L, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) [aor.<br>\
فَرَحَ,] inf. n.<br>\
فَرَحٌ, (S, * L, * Msb, &amp;c.,) He rejoiced; was joyful, or glad; or was happy; (S, A, L, Msb, K,<br>\
&amp;c.;) syn. سُرَّ: (S, A, Msb, * &amp;c.:) or he experienced a sensation of lightness in his heart: (Th,<br>\
TA:) or his bosom became dilated with delight,<br>\
or pleasure, of short continuance, transitory, or<br>\
fleeting, not lasting, as is the case in bodily and<br>\
worldly pleasures; فَرَحٌ differing from سُرُورٌ in the<br>\
manner expl. below, though each is sometimes<br>\
used as syn. with the other. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
You say, فَرِحَ بِهِ He rejoiced, was joyful, or glad,<br>\
or was happy, by reason of him, or it; syn. سُرَّ.<br>\
(S, A, Msb. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He was, or became, well<br>\
pleased, or content. ―<br>\
-b3-  And He exulted, or rejoiced above measure; or he exulted greatly, and<br>\
behaved insolently and unthankfully, or ungratefully. (S, Msb, K.) The verb is used in this<br>\
sense in the Kur xxviii. 76. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
فَرَّحَ see the paragraph here following.<br>\
4<br>\
افرحهُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِفْرَاحٌ; (S;)<br>\
and ↓ فرّحهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. تَفْرِيحٌ; (S;) He,<br>\
or it, rejoiced him; gladdened him; made him<br>\
joyful, or glad; or made him happy: (S, A,<br>\
Msb, K:) [or occasioned him a sensation of lightness of heart: or made his bosom to become dilated<br>\
with delight, or pleasure, of short continuance,<br>\
transitory, or fleeting, not lasting, as is the case<br>\
in bodily and worldly pleasures. See فَرَحٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And He, or it, made him to be well pleased, or<br>\
content. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He, or it, made him to<br>\
exult, or rejoice above measure; or to exult greatly,<br>\
and to behave insolently and unthankfully, or ungratefully. (Msb, K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also He, or it, grieved<br>\
him; or made him unhappy; lit. deprived him of<br>\
joy; or of happiness: like as أَشْكَاهُ signifies “ he<br>\
made his complaint to cease. ” (L.) [Thus it has<br>\
two contr. meanings.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And It (a debt, AA,<br>\
S, TA, or a thing, TA) burdened him, burdened<br>\
him heavily, or overburdened him. (AA, S, K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
فَرَحٌ [inf. n. of فَرِحَ, q. v.: as a simple subst.,]<br>\
Joy, mirth, or gladness; or happiness; (S, L,<br>\
Msb, K;) syn. سُرُورٌ; (Msb, K;) contr. of حُزْنٌ,<br>\
(L,) and of تَرَحٌ: (S and A in art ترح:) or a sensation of lightness of the heart: (Th, TA:) or dilatation of the bosom with delight, or pleasure, of<br>\
short continuance, transitory, or fleeting, not lasting, as is the case in bodily and worldly pleasures;<br>\
whereas سُرُورٌ is dilatation of the bosom with<br>\
delight, or pleasure, wherein is quiet or tranquillity or rest of mind, of short or of long continuance; but each is sometimes used as syn. with<br>\
the other. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A state of<br>\
being well pleased, or content, with a thing. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And Exultation, or a rejoicing above measure;<br>\
or a state of exulting greatly, and behaving insolently and unthankfully, or ungratefully. (S, Msb,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Also A festivity, or merry-making; particularly, as used in the present day, on the occasion of a marriage. ―<br>\
-b5-  Pl. أَفْرَاحٌ.] ―<br>\
-b6-  In the saying of Muteea Ibn-Iyás,<br>\
قَدْ ظَفِرَ الحُزْنُ بِالسُّرُورِ وَقَدْ<br>\
أُدِيلَ مَكْرُوهُنَا مِنَ الفَرَحِ<br>\
[Sorrow, or sadness, has overcome happiness, and<br>\
the object of our dislike, or hatred, has been given<br>\
a turn to prevail over the object of our love], by<br>\
مِنَ الفَرَحِ he means مِنَ المَفْرُوحِ بِهِ, i. e. المَحْبُوبِ.<br>\
(Ham p. 391.)<br>\
فَرُحٌ: see the paragraph here following.<br>\
فَرِحٌ and ↓ فَرْحَانُ (Msb, K) and ↓ فَرُحٌ, as in<br>\
some copies of the K and in the L and other<br>\
lexicons, or ↓ فَرُوحٌ, as in other copies and mentioned by IJ, (TA,) and ↓ فَارِحٌ and ↓ مَفْرُوحٌ, (K,)<br>\
the last mentioned by IJ; (TA;) fem. [of the<br>\
first] فَرِحَةٌ and [of the second] فَرْحَى (Msb, K)<br>\
and فَرْحَانَةٌ, (K,) but of the correctness of this last<br>\
ISd was not certain: (TA:) pl. [of the first]<br>\
فَرِحُونَ (S, Msb) and [of the second] فَرَاحَى and<br>\
فَرْحَى: (K, TA:) Rejoicing, joyful, or glad; or<br>\
happy: (Msb, K:) [or experiencing a sensation<br>\
of lightness in the heart: or having the bosom<br>\
dilated with delight, or pleasure, of short continuance, transitory, or fleeting, not lasting, as is<br>\
the case in bodily and worldly pleasures. See فَرَحٌ.]<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [iii. 164], فَرِحِينَ بِمَا آتَاهُمُ<br>\
اللّٰهُ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ [Rejoicing by reason of that which<br>\
God has given them of his bounty]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And Well pleased, or content: whence, in the Kur<br>\
[xxiii. 55 and xxx. 31], كُلُّ حِزْبٍ بِمَا لَدَيْهِمْ فَرِحُونَ<br>\
[Every sect is well pleased, or content, with that<br>\
religion which it has]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Exulting,<br>\
or rejoicing above measure; or exulting greatly,<br>\
and behaving insolently and unthankfully, or ungratefully: (S, Msb, K:) whence, in the Kur<br>\
[xxviii. 76], إِنَّ اللّٰهَ لَا يُحِبُّ الفَرِحِينَ [Verily God<br>\
does not love those who exult, or rejoice above<br>\
measure; &amp;c.]. (S, Msb.)<br>\
فَرْحَةٌ [A joy, or gladness; or a happiness]: see<br>\
an ex. voce تَرْحَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next paragraph,<br>\
in two places.<br>\
فُرْحَةٌ A cause of joy or gladness, or of happiness; a thing whereby one is made joyful or glad,<br>\
or happy; as also ↓ فَرْحَةٌ; syn. مَسَرَّةٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And A thing that thou givest to him that rejoices<br>\
thee; (L, K;) a recompense that thou givest him;<br>\
(L;) [as also ↓ فَرْحَةٌ; for] you say, لَكَ عِنْدِى<br>\
فَرْحَةٌ إِنْ بَشَّرْتَنِى, (S, A, [in one of my copies of<br>\
the S أَىْ بَشَّرْتَنِى, as though this were an explanation, but the former is the right reading,]) and<br>\
فُرْحَةٌ, (S,) meaning بُشْرَى [i. e. There is for thee,<br>\
with me, a gift for announcing a joyful event, if<br>\
thou announce to me such an event]. (A.)<br>\
فَرْحَانُ; fem. فَرْحَى, and accord. to the K فَرْحَانَةٌ<br>\
also: see فَرِحٌ.<br>\
فَرْحَانَةٌ White كَمْأَة [or truffles]: (K:) from<br>\
Kr: but ISd states the word transmitted to him<br>\
to be with ق [i. e. قُرْحَانٌ, of which قُرْحَانَةٌ is mentioned as a n. un.]. (L, TA.)<br>\
فَرُوحٌ: see فَرِحٌ.<br>\
فَارِحٌ: see فَرِحٌ.<br>\
مُفْرَحٌ A man burdened, or burdened heavily, or<br>\
overburdened, by debt, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, TA,) or by<br>\
a fine, or the like, and unable to pay it: (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
TA:) or needy, or in want; overcome; and poor:<br>\
(K:) or poor, possessing no property: (TA:) one<br>\
who is not known to have any kinsfolk or near<br>\
relations; (K, TA;) but in a trad. in which it<br>\
occurs in this sense as related by some, it is, as<br>\
others relate the trad., with ج; and so in the<br>\
sense next following: (TA:) and a slain person<br>\
found between two towns or villages. (K.) In the<br>\
trad. in which it is said لاَ يُتْرَكُ فِى الإِسْلَامِ مُفْرَحٌ<br>\
it has the first of the significations mentioned<br>\
above accord. to A&#39;Obeyd [i. e. the saying means<br>\
One who is burdened, or burdened heavily, or overburdened, by debt, &amp;c., shall not be left unbefriended<br>\
among the Muslims]. (TA.) And in the writing<br>\
that the Apostle of God wrote [as a covenant]<br>\
between the Muhájirs and the Ansár were the<br>\
words, لاَيَتْرُكُوا مُفْرَحاً حَتَّى يُعِينُوهُ عَلَى مَا كَانَ<br>\
مِنْ عَقْلٍ أَوْ فِدَآءٍ, in which مُفْرَحاً means مَفْدُوحاً,<br>\
(Ez-Zuhree, As, S,) i. e. [They shall not leave]<br>\
one who is burdened, or burdened heavily, or overburdened, by debt, [until they aid him to acquit<br>\
himself of what has become incumbent on him, of<br>\
a bloodwit or a ransom,] meaning that his debt<br>\
shall be paid for him from the treasury of the<br>\
state: so says As; and he disallowed the saying<br>\
[in this case] مُفْرَجٌ, [q. v.,] with ج. (S.)<br>\
مُفْرِحٌ A thing that makes joyful or glad, or<br>\
that makes happy: (T, L:) [and بِهِ ↓ مَفْرُوحٌ a<br>\
thing by which one is made joyful or glad, or by<br>\
which one is made happy:] one says, مَا يَسُرُّنِى<br>\
بِهِ مُفْرِحٌ, (As, T, S, L,) and بِهِ ↓ مَفْرُوحٌ, for which<br>\
one should not say مَفْرُوحٌ [alone], (As, S,) [i. e.<br>\
Nothing that makes joyful &amp;c., and by which one<br>\
is made joyful &amp;c., renders me happy by means of<br>\
it,] relating to an affair, or event. (S.) [See also<br>\
فُرْحَةٌ.]<br>\
مُفَرِّحٌ A certain well-known [exhilarating] medicine; (S, K;) a certain medicine which is given<br>\
to drink to him who is in grief, and in consequence<br>\
of which he becomes happy; thus called by the<br>\
physicians, and by others called سُلْوَانٌ. (S in art.<br>\
سلو.)<br>\
مِفْرَاحٌ One who rejoices much, or often: (K:)<br>\
or one who rejoices [app. much] whenever fortune<br>\
renders him happy. (S.)<br>\
