فَتَنَهُ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
فَتِنَ, (M,) inf. n.<br>\
فَتْنٌ, (S, M, K,) [and quasi-inf. n., in this and<br>\
other senses, فِتْنَةٌ,] He burned it (T, * S, * M, K *)<br>\
in the fire. (M.) Hence, [in the Kur li. 13,]<br>\
يَوْمَ هُمْ عَلَى النَّارِ يُفْتَنُونَ (T, * S, M, K *) i. e. [The<br>\
day, or on the day, accord. to two different readings, (يَوْمُ and يَوْمَ, the latter of which is the<br>\
more common,)] when they shall be burned (T,<br>\
S, M, K) with the fire [of Hell]. (T.) And [in<br>\
the Kur lxxxv. 10,] إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَتَنُوا الْمُؤْمِنِينَ<br>\
وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ Verily they who burned the believing<br>\
men and the believing women (T, S *) in the fire<br>\
kindled in the trench, or pit; throwing them<br>\
therein. (T.) This is said to be the primary signification of the verb. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He melted<br>\
it with fire, (T,) or put it into the fire, (S, Msb,)<br>\
namely, gold, (T, S, Msb,) and silver, in order<br>\
to separate, or distinguish, (T, Msb,) the bad from<br>\
the good, (T,) or the good from the bad, (Msb,)<br>\
or to see what was its [degree of] goodness. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, accord. to Er-Rághib, الفَتْنُ is<br>\
used as meaning The causing a man to enter into<br>\
fire [app. by way of trial, or probation], and [in<br>\
like manner] into a state of punishment, or affliction: (TA:) [and it is also used as meaning the<br>\
slaying another; whence, in the Kur iv. 102,] إِنْ<br>\
خِفْتُمْ أَنْ يَفْتِنَكُمُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا means [If ye fear<br>\
that those who have disbelieved] may slay you;<br>\
and in like manner in the Chapter of Yoonus [i. e.<br>\
in x. 83], أَنْ يَفْتِنَهُمْ means ان يَقْتُلَهُمْ. (T. [In<br>\
the TA, these two exs. are misplaced, or something has been omitted before them by a copyist.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence also,] one says, فَتَنَهُ, aor.<br>\
فَتِنَ, (K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. فَتْنٌ, (TA,) He, or it, caused him to fall<br>\
into الفِتْنَة; (K, TA;) i. e. trial; and affliction,<br>\
distress, or hardship; [generally meaning an<br>\
affliction whereby some good or evil quality is put<br>\
to the test;] (TA;) as also ↓ اِفْتَتَنَهُ; and ↓ فتّنهُ;<br>\
(K, TA;) but this, of which the inf. n. is تَفْتِينٌ,<br>\
has an intensive signification; (S;) and ↓ أَفْتَنَهُ;<br>\
(K, TA;) which last is rare, or rather, accord.<br>\
to As, [though app. not in this sense, but in<br>\
another, to be mentioned in what follows,] is not<br>\
allowable: (TA:) the first of these verbs is trans.<br>\
and intrans.: (S, K, TA:) you say also, فَتَنَ,<br>\
(AZ, T, S, K, TA,) aor.<br>\
فَتِنَ, (AZ, T, K,) inf. n.<br>\
فُتُونٌ, (AZ, T, S, TA,) He fell into فِتْنَة [i. e.<br>\
trial, or affliction, &amp;c.]; (AZ, T, K;) as also<br>\
↓ اِفْتَتَنَ: (K:) or the former signifies he shifted<br>\
from a good, to an evil, state or condition: or,<br>\
accord. to En-Nadr, one says ↓ اِفْتَتَنَ and اُفْتُتِنَ,<br>\
both meaning the same; and this is correct; but<br>\
فَتَنَ as quasi-pass. of فَتَنْتُهُ [i. e. as intrans.] is of<br>\
weak authority: (T:) and ↓ اُفْتُتِنَ, said of a man,<br>\
[as also اِفْتَتَنَ,] and فُتِنَ, signify the same, (S,<br>\
M,) accord. to AZ, (M,) i. e. he was smitten by<br>\
a فِتْنَة [or trial, &amp;c.,] so that his wealth, or property, or his intellect, departed: and likewise he<br>\
was tried, or tested: (S:) and accord. to AZ,<br>\
one says, of a man, ↓ أُفْتِنَ, [if not a mistranscription for اُفْتُتِنَ, as above,] with damm,<br>\
meaning فُتِنَ: (TA:) [and فَتَنَهُ has فُتُونٌ also as<br>\
an inf. n.:] it is said in the Kur [xx. 41], وَفَتَنَّاكَ<br>\
فُتُونًا (S) i. e. And we tried thee with a [severe]<br>\
trying: or the noun in this instance is pl. of فَتْنٌ;<br>\
or of فِتْنَةٌ, formed by disregard of the ة, like حُجُوزٌ<br>\
and بُدُورٌ which are [said to be] pls. of حُجْزَةٌ and<br>\
بَدْرَةٌ; so that the meaning is, we tried thee with<br>\
several sorts of trying: (Bd:) or, as some say,<br>\
and we purified thee with a [thorough or an effectual] purifying [like that of gold, or silver, by<br>\
means of fire]: (TA:) [in many instances] فَتَنَهُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
فَتِنَ, [inf. n. فَتْنٌ,] signifies He tried, or tested,<br>\
him; whence, in the Kur ix. 127, يُفْتَنُونَ means<br>\
They are tried, or tested, by being summoned to<br>\
war, against unbelievers or the like; or, as some<br>\
say, by the infliction of punishment or of some<br>\
evil thing. (M.) فَتَنْتُمْ أَنْفُسَكُمْ, in the Kur<br>\
[lvii. 13], means Ye caused yourselves to fall into<br>\
trial and punishment. (TA.) And وَهُمْ لَا يُفْتَنُونَ,<br>\
in the Kur xxix. 1, is expl. as meaning While they<br>\
are not tried in their persons and their possessions<br>\
so that he who has true faith may be known from<br>\
others by his patient endurance of trial. (T.)<br>\
And the saying, in a trad., إِنَّكُمْ تُفْتَنُونَ فِى القُبُورِ<br>\
means [Verily ye shall be tried, or tested, in the<br>\
graves by] the questioning of [the two angels]<br>\
Munkar and Nekeer. (TA.) [See also مَفْتُونٌ,<br>\
which is said to be an inf. n., and syn. with فِتْنَةٌ,<br>\
meaning خِبْرَةٌ, or with فُتُونٌ (mentioned above as<br>\
an inf. n. of the intrans. v. فَتَنَ), meaning<br>\
جُنُونٌ; as well as a pass. part. n.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And فَتَنَهٌ,<br>\
(M, TA,) inf. n. فَتْنٌ, (TA, [or perhaps فُتُونٌ, as<br>\
in the next following sentence]) also signifies<br>\
He made him (a man, M) to turn from, or quit,<br>\
(M, TA,) the predicament in which he was, (M,)<br>\
or the right course: (TA:) whence, in the Kur<br>\
[xvii. 75], وَإِنْ كَادُوا لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ عَنِ الَّذِى أَوْحَيْنَا<br>\
إِلَيْكَ (M, TA) i. e. [And verily they were near to]<br>\
their making thee to turn [from that which we<br>\
had revealed to thee]: thus this saying has been<br>\
explained. (TA.) [And He, or it, seduced him;<br>\
or tempted him: thus it may often be well rendered, agreeably with what next precedes and<br>\
what next follows, and with explanations of its<br>\
act. part. n. and of فِتْنَةٌ.] And one says, فَتَنَ<br>\
المَالُ النَّاسَ, aor.<br>\
فَتِنَ, inf. n. فُتُونٌ, [or perhaps فَتْنٌ,<br>\
as in the next preceding sentence,] meaning<br>\
Wealth, or property, inclined, or attracted, to it,<br>\
men, or mankind: and فُتِنَ فِى دِينِهِ and ↓ اُفْتُتِنَ,<br>\
both in the pass. form, He declined [or was made<br>\
to decline] from [the right way in] his religion.<br>\
(Msb.) And فَتَنَهُ, aor,<br>\
فَتِنَ, inf. n. فَتْنٌ and فُتُونٌ,<br>\
(M, K,) He, or it induced in him admiration,<br>\
or pleasure; (M, * K, * TA;) as also ↓ أَفْتَنَهُ [respecting which see what here follows]: (M, K:)<br>\
and one says, of a woman, فَتَنَتْهُ, (T, S,) meaning<br>\
[She enamoured him; or captivated his heart;<br>\
i. e.] she bereaved him of his heart, or reason,<br>\
(دَلَّهَتْهُ, [thus in several copies of the S, in one of<br>\
my copies بَلَّهَتْهُ,] and [so affected him that] he<br>\
loved her; (S;) as also ↓ أَفْتَنَتْهُ; (T, S;) the<br>\
former of the dial. of El-Hijáz, and the latter of<br>\
the dial. of Nejd; (T, S; *) but ↓ افتنتهُ, (T, S,)<br>\
or افتنهُ, (M,) was disallowed by As, (T, S, M,)<br>\
and he paid no regard to a verse mentioned to<br>\
him as an ex. thereof, (T,) [or] he ignored a<br>\
verse cited to him as an ex. of the pass. part. n.<br>\
from an أُرْجُوزَة of Ru-beh, not knowing it therein;<br>\
(M;) most of the lexicologists, however, allow<br>\
both: (T:) Sb says that فَتَنَهُ signifies he put [or<br>\
occasioned] in him فِتْنَة; and ↓ افتنهُ, he caused<br>\
الفِتْنَة to come to him [or to affect him]; (M;)<br>\
or he said that the latter means he made him to<br>\
be فَاتِن: (TA voce حَزَنَهُ:) and one says also, of<br>\
a man, فُتِنَ بالْمَرْأَةِ and ↓ اُفْتُتِنَ [both meaning He<br>\
was enamoured by the woman]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And<br>\
one says also, of a man, فَتَنَ, aor.<br>\
فَتِنَ, inf. n. فُتُونٌ,<br>\
meaning He desired الفُجُور [i. e. the committing of<br>\
adultery or fornication]: (AZ, TA:) or فَتَنَ إِلَى<br>\
النِّسَآءِ, inf. n. فُتُونٌ, he desired الفُجُور (T, M, K,<br>\
TA) with women or the women; as also فُتِنَ إِلَيْهِنَّ.<br>\
(M, K, TA.)<br>\

فَتَّنَ see the preceding paragraph, former half.<br>\

مُفَاتَنَةٌ [The occasioning فِتْنَة (meaning conflict, or discord, or the like,) with another]. (TA<br>\

in the latter half, in four places.<br>\
5<br>\
بَنُو ثَقِيفٍ يَتَفَتَّنُونَ أَبَدًا means يَتَحَارَبُونَ [i. e.<br>\
The sons of Thakeef (the tribe so called) contend<br>\
in war, one with another, ever]. ―<br>\

in art. عجب, where it is said to be syn. with<br>\
تَصَبَّانِى.<br>\

إِفْتَتَنَ see 1, former half, in four places: and also<br>\
in the latter half, in two places.<br>\
فَتْنٌ A sort, or species; and a state, or condition;<br>\
syn. ضَرْبٌ, (T, M, K,) and فَنٌّ, (T, K,) and لَوْنٌ,<br>\
(M, K,) and حَالٌ. (T, K.) Hence the saying of<br>\
&#39;Amr Ibn-Ahmar El-Báhilee,<br>\
إِمَّا عَلَى نَفْسٍ وَإِمَّا لَهَا<br>\
وَالعَيْشُ فَتْنَانِ فَحُلْوٌ وَمُرْ<br>\
[Either against a soul or for it; life being of two<br>\
sorts, or conditions, sweet and bitter; مُرْ being for<br>\
مُرٌّ]; (T; and the latter hemistich, without the<br>\
incipient و, is cited in the K;) thus as related by<br>\
some: but as related by Aboo-Sa&#39;eed [As], he<br>\
said فَنَّانِ, i. e. ضَرْبَانِ: and as related by Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee, فِتْنَانِ [with kesr]; and [he<br>\
seems to have held that the poet meant two-sided;<br>\
for] he says that ↓ الفِتْنُ signifies النَّاحِيَةُ. (T.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And الفَتْنَانِ, (K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, الفُتْنانِ,]) dual of الفَتْنُ, (TA,) signifies<br>\
The first and last parts of the day; or the early<br>\
part of the morning and the late part of the evening: (K, TA:) because they are two states, or<br>\
conditions, and two sorts. (TA.)<br>\
فِتْنٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
فِتْنَةٌ A burning with fire. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The<br>\
melting of gold and of silver (K, TA) in order to<br>\
separate, or distinguish, the bad from the good.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence, or] from فَتَنَ signifying<br>\
“ he melted,” (T,) or from that verb as signifying<br>\
“ he put into the fire, “(Msb,) gold, and silver,<br>\
“ for that purpose,” (T, Msb,) it signifies A trial,<br>\
or probation; (IAar, T, S, M, K, TA;) and<br>\
affliction, distress, or hardship; (TA;) and [particularly] an affliction whereby one is tried, proved,<br>\
or tested: (IAar, T, S, K, TA:) this is the sum<br>\
of its meaning in the language of the Arabs: (T,<br>\
TA: *) or the trial whereby the condition of a man<br>\
may be evinced: this, accord. to Zj, may be the<br>\
meaning in the Kur v. 45: (M:) or a mean<br>\
whereby the condition of a man is evinced, in<br>\
respect of good and of evil: (Kull:) [hence it<br>\
often means a temptation:] and ↓ مَفْتُونٌ signifies the same as فِتْنَةٌ, (S, M, K,) meaning a<br>\
trial: (K:) the pl. of فِتْنَةٌ is فِتَنٌ. (Msb.) It<br>\
proceeds from God and from man: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) [there are many instances of its proceeding<br>\
from God in the Kur; for ex., in xxxvii. 61,] إِنَّا<br>\
جَعَلْنَاهَا فِتْنَةً لِلظَّالِمِينَ i. e. [Verily we have made<br>\
it to be] a trial [to the wrongdoers] is said in<br>\
relation to the tree Ez-Zakkoom; the existence<br>\
of which they disbelieved; for when they heard<br>\
that it comes forth in the bottom of Hell, they<br>\
said, Trees become burned in the fire; then how<br>\
can they grow therein? (M.) [And hence] it signifies also Punishment, castigation, or chastisement. (T, M, K.) And Slaughter: (T:) and civil<br>\
war, or conflict occurring among people: (M:) and<br>\
slaughter, and war, and faction, or sedition, among<br>\
the parties of the Muslims when they form themselves into parties: (T:) and discord, dissension,<br>\
or difference of opinions, among the people. (IAar,<br>\
T, K.) A misleading; or causing to err, or go<br>\
astray: (T, K:) [seduction; or temptation: or<br>\
a cause thereof; such as] the ornature, finery,<br>\
show, or pomp, and the desires, or lusts, of the<br>\
present life or world, whereby one is tried: (T:)<br>\
and wealth, or children; (T, K, TA;) because<br>\
one is tried thereby: (TA:) and women; than<br>\
whom, the Prophet said, there is no فِتْنَة more<br>\
harmful to men: (T:) and a cause of one&#39;s being<br>\
pleased with a thing; (T, M, K;) as in the saying لَا تَجْعَلْنَا فِتْنَةً لِلْقَوْمِ الظَّالِمِينَ [in the Kur<br>\
x. 85, i. e. Make not us to be a cause of pleasure<br>\
to the wrongdoing people]; meaning, make not<br>\
them to prevail over us, so as to become pleased<br>\
with their unbelief and to think that they are<br>\
better than we. (T.) Also Madness, insanity,<br>\
or diabolical possession; (T, K;) and so ↓ فُتُونٌ<br>\
and ↓ مَفْتُونٌ. (T.) And Error; or deviation<br>\
from the right way. (M, K.) And Infidelity;<br>\
or unbelief: (T, M, K:) thus in the saying, [in<br>\
the Kur ii. 187,] وَالْفِتْنَةُ أَشَدُّ مِنَ الْقَتْلِ [And<br>\
infidelity, or unbelief, is more excessive than<br>\
slaughter: and the like is said in ii. 214]. (T.)<br>\
And A sin, a crime; or an act of disobedience<br>\
for which one deserves punishment. (M, K.) And<br>\
Disgrace, shame, or ignominy. (M, K.) فِتْنَةُ<br>\
الصَّدْرِ signifies الوَسْوَاسُ [app. as meaning The<br>\
devil&#39;s prompting, or suggesting, of some evil idea]:<br>\
فِتْنَةُ المَحْيَا, The being turned from the [right]<br>\
road: فِتْنَةُ المَمَاتِ, The being questioned in the<br>\
grave [by the two angels Munkar and Nekeer]:<br>\
فِتْنَةُ الضُّرِّ, The sword: and فِتْتَةُ السُّرِّ, Women.<br>\
(TA.) [And الفِتْنَةُ العَمْيَا is a phrase used in the<br>\
present day as meaning Incurable evil or trouble.]<br>\
-A2-  [It is also the name now commonly given to<br>\
The mimosa farnesiana of Linn.; (Delile&#39;s Floræ<br>\
Ægypt. Illustr. no. 962;) called by Forskål (Flora<br>\
Ægypt. Arab. p. lxxvii.) mimosa scorpioïdes.]<br>\
فِتَانٌ A covering, of leather, for the [camel&#39;s<br>\

1 in several senses.]<br>\
فَتِينٌ, applied to silver (وَرِق, i. e. فِضَّة), Burnt.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] Black stones; as though burnt<br>\
with fire. (T.) And A [stony tract such as is<br>\
called] حَرَّة, (S,) or like a حَرَّة, (Sh, T,) as though<br>\
the stones thereof were burnt: (Sh, T, S:) or a<br>\
black حَرَّة: (K:) or a حَرَّة wholly covered by black<br>\
stones, as though they were burnt: (M:) pl. فُتُنٌ:<br>\
(Sh, T, M, K:) and فَتَائِنُ signifies black حِرَار<br>\
[pl. of حَرَّةٌ]; (TA; [and the same is app. indicated in the T;]) as though its sing. were<br>\
↓ فَتِينَةٌ; and some say that this is a sing. [or<br>\
n. un.], and that فَتِين is the pl. [or coll. gen. n.];<br>\
but as some relate a verse of El-Kumeyt which<br>\
is cited as an ex. of فَتِينَة with the ة elided because<br>\
ending the verse, it is فِتِينَ, and said to be pl. of<br>\
فِتَةٌ, like as عِزِينَ is of عِزَةٌ. (T.)<br>\
-A2-  In the dial.<br>\
of El-Yemen it signifies Short; and small. (TA.)<br>\

And الفَتَّانُ, The devil; (T, S, K;) who tries, or<br>\
tempts, men, by his deceit, and his embellishing<br>\
acts of disobedience; (T;) as also ↓ الفَاتِنُ; (M,<br>\

subst. predominates: (M:) pl. of the former<br>\
فُتَّانٌ. (T, S.) And الفَتَّانَتَانِ, The dirhem and<br>\
the deenár; (K, TA;) as though they tried, or<br>\

فَاتِنٌ [is the act. part. n. of the trans. v. فَتَنَ;<br>\
and as such] signifies Causing to err, or go astray,<br>\
(T, S, M,) from the truth: (S:) hence the saying<br>\
in the Kur [xxxvii. 162], مَا أَنْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ بِفَاتِنِينَ,<br>\
(T, S, * M, *) which, accord. to Fr, means, Ye<br>\
have not power [over him] to cause him to err,<br>\
except him against whom it has been decreed<br>\
that he shall enter the fire [of Hell]; فاتنين<br>\
being made trans. by means of عَلَى because it<br>\
implies the meaning of قَادِرِينَ, which is thus<br>\
made trans.: (M:) Fr says, the people of El-<br>\
Hijáz say مَا أَنْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ بِفَاتِنِينَ; and the people of<br>\
Nejd, ↓ بِمُفْتِنِينَ, from أَفْتَنْتُ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
فَتَّانٌ.<br>\
-A2-  It is also an epithet from the intrans. v.<br>\
فَتَنَ; and as such is applied to a heart as signifying Falling into فِتْنَة [i. e. trial, or affliction, &amp;c.;<br>\
or in a state of trial, &amp;c.]. (S, * TA.)<br>\

مُفْتَنٌ: see مَفْتُونٌ. [And see also the different<br>\

مَفْتُونٌ [pass. part. n. of 1; signifying Burned:<br>\
&amp;c.]. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is applied as an epithet to a deenár<br>\

may see what is its [degree of] goodness. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
It signifies also Smitten by a فِتْنَة [or trial, &amp;c.,]<br>\

also ↓ مُفْتَنٌ. (K, TA.) And [particularly]<br>\

thus used, it is an inf. n., like مَعْقُولٌ &amp;c. (T, S,<br>\
M.) See فِتْنَةٌ, former half: and again, in the<br>\
latter half. Hence, (T, M,) as some explain it,<br>\
(M,) بِأَيِّكُمُ الْمَفْتُونُ, [in the Kur lxviii. 6,] (T, M,)<br>\
meaning In which of you is madness: (T:) but<br>\
some say that the ب is redundant; (M;) thus<br>\
says AO; (T;) the meaning being أَيُّكُمُ الْمَفْتُونُ<br>\
[Which of you is the afflicted with madness]; (T,<br>\
M;) but Zj disallowed this: (T:) J says, [in the<br>\
S,] that the ب is redundant, as in كَفَى بِاللّٰهِ شَهِيدًا,<br>\
in the Kur [xiii. last verse, &amp;c.], and [thus in<br>\
copies of the S, app. a mistake for “ or ”] المفتون<br>\
means الفِتْنَةُ, and is an inf. n. [&amp;c.]: IB says, [in<br>\
remarking upon this passage of the S,] if the ب<br>\
be redundant, المفتون is the man, and is not an<br>\
inf. n.; but if you make the ب to be not redundant, then المفتون is an inf. n. in the sense of<br>\
الفُتُون. (TA.) [See also art. ب; p. 142, second<br>\

Msb, * TA.) And in like manner the verb is<br>\

فِتَةٌ A [stony tract such as is called] حَرّة [for<br>\
which some copes of the K have جَرَّة, a mistranscription, as may be seen from a statement<br>\
voce فَتِينٌ, in art. فتن, q. v.]: pl. فِتُونَ. (K,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
فَتًى i. q. شَابٌّ, (S, M, K, TA, but omitted in<br>\
the CK,) or غُلَامٌ حَدَثٌ, (T,) or شَابٌّ حَدَثٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) it is a subst. [signifying A youth, or<br>\
young man; or one in the prime of life]: and an<br>\
epithet [signifying youthful; or in the prime of<br>\
life]: (TA:) [as an epithet, similar to فَتِىٌّ, but<br>\
restricted in application to a human being:] or it<br>\
signifies, (Mgh,) or signifies also, (Msb,) a strong<br>\
youth or young man: (Mgh, Msb:) it is said<br>\
that in the Kur xviii. 59 and 61, it is applied by<br>\
Moses to Joshua the son of Nun, because he<br>\
served him: (M, TA:) the fem. is ↓ فَتَاةٌ: (S,<br>\
K:) ―<br>\
-b2-  and it also means (tropical:)  A slave; (T, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, TA;) even if an old man; metaphorically used in this sense; (Mgh, Msb, TA;) and<br>\
in like manner, ↓ فَتَاةٌ means (tropical:)  a female slave, (T,<br>\
M, Mgh, Msb, TA;) and a female servant: (TA:)<br>\

of you say عَبْدِى and أَمَتِى, but let him say فَتَاىَ<br>\
and فَتَاتِى: (T, Mgh:) ―<br>\
-b3-  and Generous, honourable, liberal, or bountiful: (S, K:) [mostly used<br>\
as an epithet in which the quality of a subst. predominates; meaning a generous man:] a possessor<br>\
of فُتُوَّة [q. v.]: hence the saying, لَا فَتَى إِلَّا عَلِىٌّ<br>\
[There is no one endowed with generosity but, or<br>\
other than, (meaning like,) &#39;Alee]: (TA:) ―<br>\
-b4-  the<br>\
dual of فَتًى is فَتَيَانِ and فَتَوَانِ; (K, TA;) the<br>\
former occurring in the Kur xii. 36: (TA:) the<br>\
pl. of فَتًى is فِتْيَةٌ, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) a pl. of<br>\
pauc., (Msb,) not mentioned in the K, though<br>\
occurring in the Kur xviii. 9 &amp; 12, (TA,) instead<br>\
of which they did not say أَفْتَآءٌ, (Sb, M,) and فِتْوَةٌ,<br>\
(M, K,) [also a pl. of pauc.,] mentioned by Lh,<br>\
(M,) and (of mult., Msb) فِتْيَانٌ (T, S, M, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K) and فُتُوٌّ (T, S, M, K) and فُتِىٌّ: (S, M,<br>\
K:) the pl. of ↓ فَتَاةٌ is فَتَيَاتٌ: (S, M, Msb, K:)<br>\
the dim. of فَتًى is ↓ فُتَىٌّ; and that of فَتَاةٌ is ↓ فُتَيَّةٌ.<br>\
(T.) [It is disputed whether the last radical letter<br>\
of this and other words mentioned in the present<br>\
art. be originally و or ى.] ―<br>\
-b5-  الفَتَيَانِ means (tropical:)  The<br>\
night and the day; (S, M, K, TA;) like الأَجَدَّانِ<br>\
and الجَدِيدَانِ: (S, TA:) or, accord. to Seer, the<br>\
morning and the evening, or the early part of the<br>\
morning and the late part of the evening, or the<br>\
forenoon and the afternoon; syn. الغَدَاةُ وَالعَشِىُّ.<br>\
(Har p. 377.) And you say, أَقْمَتُ عِنْدَهُ فَتًى مِنْ<br>\
نَهَارٍ i. e. (tropical:)  I remained, stayed, or abode, with him<br>\
during a first part of a day. (TA.)<br>\
فَتَاةٌ fem. of فَتًى: see the next preceding paragraph, in three places.<br>\
فَتْوَى (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and فُتْوَى, (M,<br>\
K, TA,) [but the latter is mentioned by few,] and<br>\
↓ فُتْيَا, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) substs. from أَفْتَى, (T,<br>\
S,) and as such used in the place of [the inf. n.]<br>\
إِفْتَآءٌ [i. e. The giving an answer, or a reply, stating<br>\
the decision of the law, respecting a question]: (T:)<br>\
[or rather, as commonly used, a notification of<br>\
the decision of the law, in, or respecting, a particular case;] a notification, or an explanation,<br>\
of a case, given by a lawyer; (M, K;) or an<br>\
answer, or a reply, to a question relating to a<br>\
dubious judicial decision: (Er-&#39;Rághib, TA:)<br>\
[fancifully said in the Mgh and Msb to be<br>\
derived from الفَتَى:] the pl. is فَتَاوٍ, and فَتَاوَى is<br>\
said to be allowable, (Msb, TA,) and another pl.<br>\
is فُتًى, mentioned by IKoot. (TA.)<br>\
فُتْيَا: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
فَتَآءٌ [mentioned in the first sentence of this art.<br>\
as an inf. n.] Youth, or youthfulness; or the prime<br>\
of life; (T, S, M, K;) and so ↓ فُتَوَّةٌ, (T, M,) as<br>\
a subst. from فَتًى and from فَتِىٌّ: (M:) or the<br>\
latter is used in relation to human beings; and<br>\
the former, to camels [and the like], and also,<br>\
metaphorically, to human beings: (T:) one says,<br>\
قَدْ وُلِدَ فِى فَتَآءِ سِنِّهِ أَوْلَادٌ [Children had, or<br>\
have, been born to him in the youthfulness, or<br>\
prime, of his age]. (S.)<br>\
فُتَىٌّ dim. of فَتًى, q. v., latter half. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
i. e. because of its smallness, (Z, TA,) الفُتَىُّ signifies what is called قَدَحُ الشُّطَّارِ [which may be<br>\
rendered (tropical:)  The cup, or bowl, of the rogues];<br>\
(IAar, T, Z, K, TA;) [a cup, or bowl,] with<br>\
which wine is measured; (TA;) tropically thus<br>\
called. (Z, TA.)<br>\
فَتِىٌّ Youthful; or in the prime of life; (Lth,<br>\
T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) contr. of مُسِنٌّ; (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb;) applied to a camel, (T,) or to a<br>\
beast, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or to anything [i. e. to a<br>\
beast and to a human being]; (M, K;) or it is<br>\
like فَتًى [which is applied peculiarly to a human<br>\
being], but is sometimes applied to a camel: (M:)<br>\
[this last statement, however, requires confirmation, which I have not been able to find: the<br>\
epithet is generally known as applied only to a<br>\
camel or the like:] the fem. is فَتِيَّةٌ; (Lth, T, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) of which the dim. is ↓ فُتَيَّةٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and the pl. is أَفْتَآءٌ (T, S, Mgh, Msb, TA)<br>\
and فِتَآءٌ. (M, K, TA. [The former pl., though<br>\
the more common, is not mentioned in the M nor<br>\
in the K.])<br>\
فُتُوَّةٌ: see فَتَآءٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also Youthful conduct.]<br>\
One says, مَالَ إِلَى الجَهْلِ وَالفُتُوَّةِ [He inclined to<br>\
ignorant, or foolish, or silly, and youthful, conduct]. (S in art. صبو). ―<br>\
-b3-  And Generosity, honourableness, liberality, or bountifulness: (S, K, TA:)<br>\
used as meaning thus in [treatises on] the law;<br>\
but not occurring in the Sunneh nor in the Scripture [i. e. the Kur-án]: the earliest mentioner<br>\
thereof was Jaafar Es-Sádik. (TA.)<br>\
فُتَيَّةٌ: see فَتًى, latter half: and see also فَتِىٌّ.<br>\
أَفْتَى i. q. أَصْغَرُ [as meaning less, and least, in<br>\
years, or age]: from الفتى [i. e. الفَتَى or الفَتِىُّ].<br>\
(Ham p. 207.)<br>\
أُفَيْتِيَةٌ [an irreg.] dim. of فِتْيَةٌ [which is a pl. of<br>\
فَتًى; like as أُصَيْبِيَةٌ, accord. to Sb, is dim. of صِبْيَةٌ,<br>\
a pl. of صَبِىٌّ]. (TA.)<br>\
