load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'فمفَمٌ The mouth: (MA, KL, &amp;c.:) it is originally<br>\
فَوَهٌ, (S, K, and Msb in art. فوه,) with two fet-hahs,<br>\
(Msb in that art.,) or فَوْهٌ; (so in some copies of<br>\
the S;) the ه being cut off from it, the و is not<br>\
susceptible of declension, because it is quiescent,<br>\
therefore م is substituted for it; but when you<br>\
form the dim. or the pl., you restore it to its original state, saying [in the former case] فُوَيْهٌ and<br>\
[in the latter case] أَفْوَاهٌ, and not أَفْمَآءٌ [in some of<br>\
the copies of the S not أَفْمَامٌ]: but when you form<br>\
the rel. n., you say ↓ فَمِىٌّ; and, if you will,<br>\
↓ فَمَوِىٌّ, combining the substitute and the letter<br>\
for which it is substituted, like as they say in the<br>\
dual فَمَوَانِ; this being held to be allowable<br>\
because of there being therein another letter rejected, i. e. the ه, as though they made the م in<br>\
this case to be a substitute for the ه, not for the<br>\
و: (S, TA:) and one says also فَمَيَانِ, which,<br>\
like فَمَوَانِ, is anomalous; (IAar, K in art. فوه;)<br>\
but one says فَمَانِ also, as well as فَمَوَانِ: (Msb<br>\
in art. فوه:) it has three forms, فَمٌ and فُمٌ and فِمٌ:<br>\
(S, K, TA:) and some decline it doubly; saying<br>\
in the nom. case فُمٌ, accus. فَمًا, and gen. فِمٍ; (S,<br>\
TA;) like اِمْرُؤٌ and اِبْنُمٌ, which have been said to<br>\
be the only other instances of the kind: (TA:)<br>\
when it is prefixed to the [pronominal] ى, one<br>\
says فِىَّ and فَمِى: but when to [a pronoun] other<br>\
than the ى, it is declined with the letters و and ا<br>\
and ى, so that one says فُوُهُ and فَاهُ and فِيهِ; but<br>\
one also says فَمُهُ: (Msb. in art. فوه:) and sometimes the م is musheddedeh, (S, K,) in poetry,<br>\
as in the saying, (S, TA,) of Mohammad Ibn-Dhu-eyb El-&#39;Ománee El-Fukeymee, the rájiz,<br>\
(TA in this art. and in art. طسم,) addressing<br>\
Er-Rasheed, or, accord. to IKh, said in relation<br>\
to Suleymán Ibn-&#39;Abd-El-Melik and &#39;Abd-El-<br>\
&#39;Azeez. (TA in art. طسم,)<br>\
يَا لَيْتَهَا قَدْ خَرَجَتْ مِنْ فُمِّهِ<br>\
حَتَّى يَعُودَ المُلْكُ فِى أُسْطُمِّهِ<br>\
(S, TA) or أُطْسُمِّهِ i. e. [O, would that it had gone<br>\
forth from his mouth, so that the dominion might<br>\
return] to its rightful owner; (S in art. سطم, and<br>\
TA in art. طسم;) and it would have been allowable, (S, TA,) accord. to ISk, (S,) or accord. to<br>\
Fr, (TA,) if he had said ↓ من فَمِّهِ, with fet-h to<br>\
the ف: (S, TA:) the pl. of فم, with teshdeed, is<br>\
أَفْمَامٌ; and its dim. is ↓ فُمَيْمٌ, mentioned by Lh.<br>\
(TA.) MF says that many of the expositors of<br>\
the Tes-heel have collected the dial. vars. of this<br>\
word, compounded and uncompounded, and they<br>\
have exceeded twenty; that with fet-h, they say,<br>\
being the most common and the most chaste.<br>\
(TA.) [See more in art. فوه.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] الفم<br>\
is metonymically applied to (tropical:)  The teeth. (Ham<br>\
p. 242.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] فَمُ الحُوتِ (assumed tropical:)  The star<br>\
[a] in the mouth of Piscis Australis. (Kzw &amp;c.:<br>\
see art. حوت.) And فَمُ الفَرَسِ (assumed tropical:)  The star [e] upon<br>\
the lip of Pegasus. (Kzw.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And فَمُالرَّحِمِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The mouth of the womb.] ―<br>\
-b5-  And فَمُ النَّهْرِ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
mouth of the river. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And [hence likewise,] فَمٌ is also used as meaning (assumed tropical:) Branch;<br>\
opposed to اِسْتٌ meaning “ root. ” (TA in art.<br>\
سته; in which see اِسْتٌ, last quarter.)<br>\
-A2-  فَمٌ مِنَ<br>\
الدِّبَاغِ means The quantity that is used at one<br>\
time, of tan; (Fr, K, * TA;) like نَفْسٌ مِنْهُ. (Fr,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
فَمِىٌّ and فَمَوِىٌّ: see the preceding paragraph,<br>\
near the beginning.<br>\
فُمَّ a dial. var. of the conjunction تُمَّ [q. v.]:<br>\
(K:) or the ف in the former is a substitute for<br>\
the ث in the latter: one says, رَأَيْتُ عَمْرًا فُمَّ زَيْدًا<br>\
and ثُمَّ زَيْدًا, both meaning the same [i. e. I saw<br>\
&#39;Amr: then Zeyd]: (TA:) and in like manner<br>\
one says فُمَّتَ and فُمَّتْ, meaning تُمَّتَ and تُمَّتْ.<br>\
