فَظُعَ الأمْرُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
فَظُعَ, (O,)<br>\
inf. n. فَظَاعَةٌ, (S, O, Msb,) and perhaps فَظَعٌ [respecting which see فَظِعَ]; (Mbr, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ افظع; (S, O, Msb, K;) The affair, or event,<br>\
was, or became, hard, difficult, or distressing;<br>\
bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly; excessive,<br>\
or exorbitant: (S:) or excessively bad, evil,<br>\
abominable, foul, or unseemly. (O, Msb, K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
And فَظِعَ الأَمْرَ, (K, TA,) thus in the copies of<br>\
the K, and in like manner in the O, [where I<br>\
find, AZ says, فَظِعْتُ الأَمْرَ, aor. أَفْظَعُهُ,] but [SM<br>\
says] in the “ Nawádir ” of AZ, فَظِعَ بِالأَمْرِ, inf. n.<br>\
فَظَاعَةٌ, (TA,) He reckoned the affair, or event,<br>\
or judged it to be, great, hard, difficult, or distressing, syn. اِسْتَعْظَمَهُ, (K,) or was made to fear, or<br>\
be frightened, and was overcome, by it, (AZ, O,<br>\
TA,) and trusted not that he had power to accomplish it, or to bear it: (AZ, O, K, TA:) it is said<br>\
in a trad., أُرِيتُ أَنَّهُ وُضِعَ فِى يَدَىَّ سَوَارَانِ مِنْ ذَهَبٍ<br>\
فَفَظِعْتُهُمَا [I was made to see, meaning I imagined,<br>\
or dreamt, that two bracelets of gold were put upon<br>\
my arms, and I regarded them with fear]; in<br>\
which instance, as IAth says, the verb is thus<br>\
made trans. in accordance with its meaning,<br>\
which is أَكْبَرْتُهُمَا, and خِفْتُهُمَا: but the phrase<br>\
commonly known is فَظِعْتُ بِهِ and مِنْهُ: (TA:)<br>\
you say, فَظِعْنُ بِكَذَا I was unable to do, or<br>\
accomplish such a thing: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K: *)<br>\
and فَظِعْتُ بِأَمْرِى occurs in a trad. as meaning [I<br>\
found that] my affair, or case, was hard, difficult,<br>\
or distressing, to me, and I regarded it with fear,<br>\
or dread: فَظِعَ بِالأَمْرِ, inf. n. فَظَاعَةٌ and فَظَعٌ,<br>\
means He saw the affair, or event, or case, to be<br>\
فَظِيع [q. v.]: Mbr says, فَظَعٌ is an inf. n. of فَظِعَ<br>\
بِهِ: or it may be an inf. n. of فَظُعَ, like as كَرَمٌ<br>\
is of كَرُمَ: but I have not heard it save in the<br>\
saying of the poet,<br>\
قدْ عِشْتُ فِى النَّاسِ أَطْوَارًا عَلَى خُلُقٍ<br>\
شَتَّى وَقَاسَيْتُ فِيهِ اللِّينَ وَالفَظَعَا<br>\
[I have lived among men during several periods,<br>\
conforming to disposition differing in kind, (عَلَى<br>\
خُلُقٍ شَتَّى being like the phrase إِنَّ سَعْيَكُمْ لَشَتَّى,<br>\
in the Kur xcii. 4, meaning انّ مَسَاعِيكُمْ لَأَشْتَاتٌ,<br>\
as is said in the Ksh and by Bd,) and I have<br>\
endured therein softness and hardness]. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
فَظِعَ, (O, K,) aor.<br>\
فَظَعَ, inf. n. فَظَعٌ, (O,) said of a<br>\
vessel, (K,) It became full. (O, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
فظّع, inf. n. تَفْظِيعٌ, accord. to Freytag, signifies He described a thing as great: but for this<br>\
he names no authority: by “ great ” is here<br>\
meant hard, difficult, or distressing; &amp;c.: see 1,<br>\
first sentence.]<br>\
4<br>\
افظع as intrans.: see 1, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
أَفْظَعَنِى الأَمْرُ The affair, or event, made me to<br>\
fear, or frightened me: made me to fall into a<br>\
hard, difficult, or distressing, case: (TA:) made<br>\
me to be without power, or strength, or ability;<br>\
disabled, or incapacitated, me. (Ham p. 32.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And أُفْظِعَ He (a man, S, O, Msb) suffered the<br>\
befalling of a hard, difficult, or distressing, event.<br>\

وَقَدْ عَجَبَتْ أُمَامَةُ أَنْ رَاتَنِى<br>\
تَفَرَّعَ لِمَّتِى شَيْبٌ فَظِيعُ<br>\
[And Umámeh wondered that she saw me such<br>\
