فُلُزٌّ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K,) the first of which is<br>\
what is commonly known, (TA,) White copper<br>\
(نُحَاس أَبْيَض [app. a sort of bronze in which the<br>\
relative quantity of the tin is unusually large]<br>\
whereof are made cast cooking-pots (Lth, O, K,<br>\
TA) of large size, and mortars in which substances are pounded: (TA:) or the metals; gold<br>\
and silver and copper and the like: (A&#39;Obeyd, A,<br>\
O, K: *) or the substance [i. e. recrement] that is<br>\
removed [or blown away] by the blacksmith&#39;s<br>\
bellows from molten metals: (S, O, K:) or the<br>\
dross, or recrement, of iron, (O, K,) that is<br>\
removed [or blown away] by the blacksmith&#39;s<br>\
bellows: (O:) or stones: (O, K:) its primary<br>\
meaning is [said to be] hardness, and ruggedness.<br>\
(IDrd, O.) الفِلِزَّاتُ [pl. of الفِلِزُّ (not to be mistaken for الفِلَذَاتُ)] signifies The seven metals;<br>\
namely, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin [thus<br>\
I here render الأُسْرُبّ], and tutenag [thus I render<br>\
الخَارصِينِى, following De Sacy and others].<br>\
(Kzw.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, as being likened to the<br>\
فلزّ above described, (TA,) (tropical:)  A strong, hard,<br>\
and thick, or coarse, man. (K, * TA.) And (tropical:)  A<br>\
niggard: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K, TA:) as though<br>\
he were hard iron, upon which nothing would<br>\
make any impression. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A thing<br>\
upon which swords are tested by striking it therewith. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.)<br>\
