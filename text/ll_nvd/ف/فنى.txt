فَنِىَ, (T, S, M, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor. يَفْنَى;<br>\
(T, M, Msb, K;) and فَنَى, aor. يَفْنَى, (M, K,)<br>\
which is extr., mentioned by Kr, and said by<br>\
him to be of the dial. of Belhárith Ibn-Kaab;<br>\
(M;) the former of the two verbs being that<br>\
which is commonly known; (TA;) inf. n. فَنَآءٌ,<br>\
(T, S, M, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) which is of both of the<br>\
verbs; (TA;) It (i. e. a thing, S, Msb, TA)<br>\
passed away and came to an end; vanished away;<br>\
became spent, or exhausted; failed entirely;<br>\
ceased, perished, or came to nought; or was, or<br>\
became, transitory, evanescent, or non-existent;<br>\
the inf. n. being syn. with نَفَادٌ; (Aboo-&#39;Alee El-<br>\
Kálee, TA;) contr. of بَقَآءٌ; (M, TA;) and the<br>\
pret. being syn. with عُدِمَ: (K, TA:) it is said<br>\
of every created thing that it is subject to الفَنَآء.<br>\
(Msb.) [Hence] دَارُ الفَنَآءِ [The abode of transitoriness, evanescence, or perishableness,] means the<br>\
present world. (T in art. دور.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, said of<br>\
a man, (T, M, K,) i. e. فَنِىَ, aor. and inf. n. as<br>\
above, (M,) (tropical:)  He was, or became, extremely<br>\
aged; or old and infirm; syn. هَرِمَ: (M, K:) or<br>\
he became on the verge of death by reason of<br>\
extreme age or of age and infirmity. (T.)<br>\
Lebeed says,<br>\
حَبَائِلُهُ مَبْثُوثَةٌ بِسَبِيلهِ<br>\
وَيَفْنَى إِذَا مَا أَخْطَأَتْهُ الحَبَائِلُ<br>\
(T, M,) meaning [His snares are spread in his<br>\
way, and when the snares fail to catch him] he<br>\
becomes old and infirm and so dies: (T:) or it<br>\
means, when death misses him he becomes old and<br>\
infirm. (M.)<br>\
3<br>\
فاناهُ, (T, S, M, K,) inf. n. مُفَانَاةٌ, (T, TA,)<br>\
He (a man, S, M) soothed, or coaxed, him: (AA,<br>\
T, S, M, K:) and, (M,) accord. to El-Umawee,<br>\
(T, S,) he stilled, or quieted, him. (T, S, M.)<br>\
El-Kumeyt says, (S, M,) mentioning anxieties,<br>\
(M,)<br>\
تُقِيمُهُ تَارَةً وَتُقْعِدُهُ<br>\
كَمَ يُفَانِى الشَّمُوسَ قَائِدُهَا<br>\
[They rouse him at one time, and at another time<br>\
they render him sedate like as her leader soothes,<br>\
or coaxes, or like as he stills, or quiets, the refractory mare]. (S, M: in the T, accord. to the TT,<br>\
the verse ends with رَائِدُهَا [her pastor], instead of<br>\
قَائِدُهَا.) Accord. to IAar, فاناهُ signifies واِجاهُ<br>\
[app. a mistranscription for وَاخَاهُ, originally آخَاهُ,<br>\
He fraternized with him; or acted with him in a<br>\
brotherly manner]. (TA.) [Hence the phrase]<br>\
أُفَانِى الأَيَّامَ i. e. أُزَجِّى الزَّمَانَ [meaning I make<br>\
the time to pass away easily; as though beguiling<br>\
it]. (Har p. 607.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And one says, بَنُو فُلَانٍ مَا<br>\
يُعَانُونَ مَالَهُمْ وَلَا يُفَانُونَهُ i. e. The sons of such a one<br>\
do not tend, or take care of, their cattle, or camels,<br>\
or [other] property, and do not manage the same<br>\
well. (T.)<br>\
4<br>\
افناهُ He, or it, caused it, or him, to pass<br>\
away and come to an end; to vanish away; to<br>\
become spent, or exhausted; to fail entirely; to<br>\
cease, perish, or come to nought; he, or it, did<br>\
away with, destroyed, or annihilated, it, or him;<br>\
(T, S, * M, Msb, * K, TA;) trans. of فَنِىَ. (T, S,<br>\
Msb, K.) The saying of a rájiz, (T, TA,) namely,<br>\
Abu-n-Nejm, (TA,) describing a pastor of sheep<br>\
or goats,<br>\
يَقُولُ لَيْتَ اللّٰهَ قَدْ أَفْنَاهَا<br>\
(T, TA,) may mean an imprecation against them,<br>\
i. e. He says, would that God had destroyed them:<br>\
(T:) ―<br>\
-b2-  or it means, would that God had made<br>\
to grow for them [the plant called] الفَنَى, i. e.<br>\
عِنَبُ الثَّعْلَبِ; so that they might have abundance<br>\
of milk, and become fat. (T, TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَفَانَوا, (S, K,) or تفانوا قَتْلًا, (M,) They<br>\
destroyed one another, (S, M, K,) [or they shared,<br>\
one with another, in destruction, (see an ex. in a<br>\
verse cited voce دَقَّ,) by slaughter,] in war, or<br>\
battle. (S.)<br>\
الفَنَى, thus, with ى, in the M, and thus it<br>\
should be written accord. to Aboo-&#39;Alee El-Kálee,<br>\
in the T and S with ا, and in like manner in the<br>\
K, in which it is [mentioned in art. فنو, and]<br>\
written without the article ال (فَنًا), and said to<br>\
be a pl., of which the sing. is ↓ الفَنَاة, (TA,) [The<br>\
plant called] عِنَبُ الثَّعْلَبِ; [see art. ثعلب; and<br>\
see also الأَفَانِى, in this art.;] (T, S, M, K;)<br>\
whereof one is called ↓ فَنَاةٌ: (S:) or, as some say,<br>\
another plant; (T;) [i. e.,] as some say, a species<br>\
of trees, or plants, (شَجَرٌ,) having red berries,<br>\
(حَبّ), (S,) of which necklaces are made, (S,) or<br>\
the unbroken of which are made use of as قَرَارِيط<br>\
[meaning carat-weights] with which to weigh,<br>\
every berry (حَبَّة) being a قِيرَاط: and some say<br>\
that it is a herb that grows in rugged places,<br>\
rising from the ground to the height of the<br>\
measure of a finger, and less, and depastured by<br>\
the cattle. (M.)<br>\
فَنَاةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\
places:<br>\
-A2-  and see also art. فنو.<br>\
فِنَآءٌ A yard, or an exterior court, i. e. a wide<br>\
space, (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) in front, (T, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) or extending from the sides, (S,<br>\
Msb,) of a house: (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K:) pl.<br>\
أَفْنِيَةٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K) and فُنِىٌّ: (K:) and ثِنَآءٌ<br>\
[q. v.] signifies the same. (T, M.)<br>\
فَانٍ part. n. of فَنِىَ [i. e. signifying Passing<br>\
away and coming to an end; &amp;c.]. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
(tropical:)  An old man extremely aged, or old and infirm;<br>\
(M, * Msb, K, * TA;) so called because of his<br>\
nearness to passing away, or perishing: (Msb:)<br>\
or an old man whose faculties have entirely failed.<br>\
(Mgh.) And فَانِيَةٌ occurs in a trad., applied to a<br>\
she-camel, or to camels, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Advanced in<br>\
age. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [فَانٍ فِى اللّٰهِ, in the language of<br>\
the mystics, means (assumed tropical:)  Lost in contemplation of<br>\
God, and insensible to all else.]<br>\
أَفْنَآءٌ مِنَ النَّاسِ is expl. in art. فنو.<br>\
الأَفَانِى [without the article أَفَانٍ] is the name of<br>\
A species of plant, (T, S, K,) yellow, and red;<br>\
(T;) [said to be so called] while fresh and succulent; (S;) accord. to AA, (T,) when it has dried<br>\
up, it is called الحَمَاطُ; (S, T;) but this is a<br>\
mistake; for الافانى signifies a particular species<br>\
of plant by itself, of the herbs, or leguminous<br>\
plants, termed ذُكُور, which dries up, and becomes<br>\
scattered; whereas the حماط is the حَلبة [a mistranscription for حَلَمَة], and this does not dry up,<br>\
because it is of the [kind called] جَنْبَة and عُرْوَة<br>\
(T:) the n. un. is أَفَانِيَةٌ, (T, S.) like ثَمَانِيَةٌ [in<br>\
measure]. (S.) And it is said to signify also<br>\
[The plant called] عِنَبُ الثَّعْلَبِ. (S. [See also<br>\
الفَنَى, above.])<br>\
مَفْنَاةٌ A land (أَرْضٌ) suitable to those who alight<br>\
and abide therein: (K, TA:) it occurs, in a verse<br>\
of Keys Ibn-El-&#39;Eyzár El-Hudhalee, with ق, [as<br>\
some relate that verse,] but As says that in the<br>\
dial. of Hudheyl it is with ف. (TA in art. قنى.)<br>\
