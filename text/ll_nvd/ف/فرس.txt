فَرَسَهُ, aor.<br>\
فَرِسَ, inf. n. فَرْسٌ, (S, M, O, Msb, K,<br>\
&amp;c.,) He (a lion) broke, or crushed so as to break,<br>\
its neck; (S, A, * Mgh, * O, K;) i. e., the neck of<br>\
his فَرِيسَة; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ افترسهُ: (S:) this<br>\
is the primary signification: (S, Mgh, TA:) or<br>\
he (a beast of prey) seized it, (a thing,) and broke,<br>\
or crushed so as to break, its neck; as also ↓ افترسهُ:<br>\
(M:) or he (a lion) broke it; i. e., his فَرِيسَة:<br>\
(Msb:) and he bruised, or crushed, and broke, it;<br>\
namely, a thing. (M.) Accord. to ISk, (S,) you<br>\
say, فَرَس الذِئْبُ الشَّاةَ, (S, TA,) meaning The wolf<br>\
seized the sheep, or goat, and broke, or crushed so<br>\
as to break, its neck: (TA:) accord. to En-Nadr<br>\
(i. e. ISh), you say, أَكَلَ الذِّئْبُ الشَّاةَ [The wolf<br>\
ate, or devoured, the sheep, or goat], but not<br>\
↓ افترسها. (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb,) He killed it, in any manner; (S, Mgh, O,<br>\
Msb, K;) as also ↓ افترسهُ: (TA:) or ↓ the latter,<br>\
he (a lion, O, or a wolf, TA) captured it; or<br>\
made it his prey. (O, K, TA. See also 2 [where<br>\
a similar but tropical usage of the former verb is<br>\
mentioned.]) You say, فَرَسَهُ الأَسَدُ The lion killed<br>\
him or it. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  فَرَسَ الذَّبِيحَةَ, (M, Msb,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
فَرِسَ, (M,) inf. n. as above, (S, M, Mgh,) He<br>\
(the slaughterer) broke the bone of the neck of the<br>\
slaughtered animal before it became cold: (S,<br>\
Mgh, O:) or broke its neck before its death:<br>\
(Msb:) or cut, or severed, its نُخَاع [or spinal<br>\
cord]: or divided its neck: (M, TA:) or slaughtered it so as to reach to the نخاع: (AO, TA:)<br>\
the action thus [variously] expl. is forbidden. (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  قَبِيحَةً ↓ فَرَسَهُ فِرْسَةً He struck<br>\
him [in an abominable manner, app. in the back,]<br>\
so that the part between his hips became depressed<br>\
and his navel protruded. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  فَرُسَ, aor.<br>\
فَرُسَ,<br>\
(S, A, O, K,) inf. n. فُرُوسَةٌ (S, A, O, K *) and<br>\
فَرَاسَةٌ (S, K, * in the O فِرَاسَةٌ) and فُرُوسِيَّةٌ, (S, * A,<br>\
O, * K, *) all of which ns. are mentioned as syn.<br>\
by As, (TA,) [as they are also in the S and K,]<br>\
and the first and last, in like manner, by IAar,<br>\
(TA,) [but the first is expressly said to be an<br>\
inf. n. of فَرُسَ in the S and A only, and the<br>\
second in the S only, and the third (which seems<br>\
to be rather a simple subst.) in the A only,] He<br>\
was, or became, skilled in horsemanship, or in the<br>\
management of horses, (S, A, O, K, TA,) and in<br>\
riding them, (O, * K, TA,) and in urging them to<br>\
run, and in remaining firm upon them: (TA:)<br>\
or فَرَاسَةٌ and فُرُوسَةٌ are inf. ns. having no verb:<br>\
Lh only [says ISd] mentions فَرَسَ and فَرُسَ as<br>\
signifying he became a horseman; and this is<br>\
extr.: (M, TA:) but [beside what has been cited<br>\
above, from the S and A and K,] IKtt also says<br>\
that فَرَسَ الخَيْلَ, inf. n. فُرُوسَةٌ and فُرُوسِيَّةٌ, signifies he rode horses well; and in like manner<br>\
فَرُسَ [but not followed by الخيل]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, (assumed tropical:)  He was, or became, skilled in anything<br>\
that he endeavoured to do. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  فَرَسَ بِالنَّظَرِ,<br>\
[and بِنَظَرِهِ, and بِعَيْنِهِ, and فَرَسَ فِى النَّاسِ, (see<br>\
فَارِسٌ,)] aor.<br>\
فَرِسَ, (Msb,) inf. n. فِرَاسَةٌ and فَرَاسَةٌ, (As,<br>\
IAar, Msb, TA,) accord. to the citation of the<br>\
words of As and IAar in the L, but this is at<br>\
variance with the opinion generally held, [which<br>\
is, that فَرَاسَةٌ is an inf. n. only of فَرُسَ, signifying<br>\
as expl. above, and that فِرَاسَةٌ is a subst. from<br>\
تَفَرُّسٌ, having no proper verb of which it is an<br>\
inf. n.,] (TA,) is said of a man [in the same sense<br>\
as تَفَرَّسَ, (q. v.,) as will be seen from the explanations of فِرَاسَةٌ and فَارِسٌ, below]. (Msb.) See<br>\
5, latter part, in two places.<br>\
-A4-  فَرِسَ He kept<br>\
continually, or constantly, to the eating of the<br>\
dates called فَرَاس. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He pastured<br>\
upon, or depastured, the plants called فِرْس. (O, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
فرّس الغَنَمَ, (inf. n. تَفْرِيسٌ, TA,) He (a wild<br>\
beast) seized often the sheep or goats, or seized<br>\
many of them, and broke, or crushed so as to<br>\
break, their necks. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  فرّسه الشَّىْءَ,<br>\
(inf. n. as above, TA,) He exposed to him (namely<br>\
a wild beast) the thing, [meaning the animal,]<br>\
that he might seize it, and break, or crush so as<br>\
to break, its neck: and إَيَّاهُ ↓ أَفْرَسَهُ the threw, or<br>\
cast, it to him, that he might do so to it: (M:)<br>\
and الرَّجُلُ الأَسَدَ حِمَارَهُ ↓ أَفْرَسَ the man left his ass<br>\
to the lion, that he might break his neck, or kill<br>\
him, or make him his prey, while he himself should<br>\
escape. (S, K.) El-&#39;Ajjáj uses the former verb in<br>\
relation to the kind of flies called نُعَر, saying,<br>\
ضَرْبًا إِذَا صَابَ اليَآفِيخَ احْتَفَرْ<br>\
فِى الهَامِ دُحْلَانًا يُفَرِّسْنَ النُّعَرْ<br>\
[A beating which, when it falls upon the tops of<br>\
heads, digs, in the pates, hollows that afford prey<br>\
to the blue stinging flies]; meaning, that these<br>\
wounds are wide, and enable the نعر to obtain<br>\
thence what they desire. (M.) And one of the<br>\
poets uses it in relation to human beings, in the<br>\
following verses, [which exhibit an instance of the<br>\
license termed إِقْوَآء,] cited by IAar:<br>\
قَدْ أَرْسَلُونِى قِى الكَوَاعِبِ رَاعِيًا<br>\
↓ فَقَدْ وَأَبِى رَاعِى الكَوَاعِبِ أُفْرَسُ<br>\
أَتَتْهُ ذِئَابٌ لَا يُبَالِينَ رَاعِيًا<br>\
وَكُنُّ سَوَامًا تَشْتَهِى أَنْ تُفَرَّسَا<br>\
[They had sent me among the girls with swelling<br>\
breasts, as a guardian; and, by my father, while<br>\
guardian of the girls with swelling breasts, or by<br>\
the father of the guardian of the girls with swelling breasts, I was (lit. I am) made a prey: there<br>\
came thither wolves not caring for a guardian,<br>\
and those females were (as) pasturing camels<br>\
eagerly desiring to be given as prey]: he likens<br>\
these women to pasturing camels, although differing from them inasmuch as the latter do not<br>\
eagerly desire to be given as prey, since this<br>\
would be a cause of their death, whereas women<br>\
do eagerly desire it, since فَرْسُ الرِّجَالِ لِلنِّسَآءِ [lit.<br>\
men&#39;s making women their prey] is in this case<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  men&#39;s holding commerce of love with women:<br>\
أُفْرَسُ is for فُرِسْتُ; for, as Sb says, they sometimes put أَفْعَلُ in the place of فَعَلْتُ: أَبِى is in<br>\
the gen. case as governed by وَ denoting swearing;<br>\
and راعى الكواعب may be a denotative of state<br>\
relating to the ت [the pronoun of the first person]<br>\
understood [in أُفْرَسُ for فُرِسْتُ]; or وأبى may be<br>\
prefixed to راعى الكواعب, governing it in the gen.<br>\
case, and by the latter expression he may mean<br>\
himself: by wolves not caring for a guardian,<br>\
he means wicked men not caring for him who<br>\
guarded these women: and he uses the word<br>\
تشتهى to denote intense desire; for if he did not<br>\
mean intenseness, he would have said تُرِيدُ. (M.)<br>\
3<br>\
فارسهُ, inf. n. مُفَارَسَةٌ and فِرَاسٌ, (M, TA,)<br>\
[app., He vied, or contended, with him in horsemanship: this signification seems to be indicated<br>\
by what immediately precedes in the M, which is,<br>\
فَرَسَ and فَرُسَ “ he became a horseman: ” but<br>\
perhaps it may signify he vied, or contended, with<br>\
him in فِرَاسَة, meaning insight, &amp;c.: or it may<br>\
have both these significations.]<br>\
4<br>\
افرس He (a pastor) had the neck of one of<br>\
his sheep, or goats, broken, or had one of them<br>\
killed, (S, O,) or taken, (K,) by the wolf, (S, O,<br>\
K,) he being inadvertent. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2, in<br>\
two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  افرس عَنْ بَقِيَّةِ مَالٍ He left a remainder of property [as a prey], having taken all<br>\
beside thereof. (AA, O, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تفرّس He pretended to others that he was a<br>\
horseman, or one skilled in horsemanship. (As, O,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A2-  He acted deliberately, (S, O, K, TA,)<br>\
and considered, or examined, a thing, or did so<br>\
repeatedly, in order to know it, or to obtain a<br>\
clear knowledge of it. (S, * K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تفرّس<br>\
فِيهِ الشَّىْءِ [He perceived in him the thing intuitively; or by a kind of thaumaturgic faculty,<br>\
and by right opinion and conjecture: or by means<br>\
of indications, or evidences, and experiments, and<br>\
the make and dispositions: (see فِرَاسَةٌ, below:)<br>\
or] he perceived in him the thing by forming a<br>\
correct opinion from its outward signs; syn. تَوَسَّمَهُ.<br>\
(M.) You say, تَفَرَّسْتُ فِيهِ خَيْرًا, (S, O,) or الخَيْرَ,<br>\
(Msb,) [I perceived in him good, or goodness, intuitively; &amp;c.: or] I discovered (تَعَرَّفْتُ) in him<br>\
good, or goodness, by right opinion. (Msb.) [↓ فَرَسَ<br>\
بِالنَّظَرِ, and بِنَظَرِهِ, and بِعَيْنِهِ, inf. n. فِرَاسَةٌ and فَرَاسَةٌ,<br>\
(respecting which, however, see 1, last quarter,)<br>\
signifies the same as تفرّس; i. e., He perceived, or<br>\
discerned, the internal, inward, or intrinsic, state,<br>\
condition, character, or circumstances, by examination of outward indications, &amp;c., and by his<br>\
eye. And so فِى النَّاسِ ↓ فَرَسَ He saw into the<br>\
internal, inward, or intrinsic, states, &amp;c., of men.<br>\

فَرْنَسَتْ, as is shown by the mention of the part. n.<br>\
مُفَرْنِسَةٌ,] A woman&#39;s good managing of the affairs<br>\
of her house, or tent: (Lth, K, TA:) the ن is<br>\
augmentative. (TA.)<br>\
الفُرْسُ: see فَارِسٌ.<br>\
فِرْسٌ A species of plant: (Yaakoob, S, M, O,<br>\
K:) the قَصْقَاص, (O, and so in copies of the K,)<br>\
or قَضْقَاض, (so in the CK,) [each said to be a<br>\
name of the أُشْنَان (or kali) of Syria, or of a<br>\
species of حَمْض, q. v.,] accord. to Abu-l-Meká-<br>\
rim: (O:) or the حَبْن [q. v.]: or the بَرْوَق [q. v.]:<br>\
(O, K:) or the [small kind of thorny trees called]<br>\
شِرْس. (TA.)<br>\
فَرَسٌ [A horse; and a mare;] one of what are<br>\
called خَيْلٌ; (M;) the name فرس is given to it<br>\
because it crushes and breaks the ground with its<br>\
hoofs; (A, O; *) and is applied to the male and<br>\
the female; (S, M, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) but<br>\
mostly applied to the latter; (M;) the female<br>\
not being called ↓ فَرَسَةٌ; (S, O;) or the female is<br>\
[sometimes] thus called: (Yoo, IJ, M, Msb, K:)<br>\
it is applied also to the Arabian, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
and to the Turkish, (Msb,) or that which is not<br>\
Arabian: (Mgh:) or, accord. to Mohammad [the<br>\
Hanafee Imám], to the Arabian only; but for<br>\
this [says Mtr] I find no authority of a lexicologist, except that ISk, speaking of a solid-hoofed<br>\
animal, says, “whether it be a بِرْزَوْن or a فَرَس<br>\
or a بَغْل or a حِمَار: ” (Mgh:) the pl. is أَفْرَاسٌ,<br>\
(S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) [a pl. of pauc. but used<br>\
as a pl. of mult. also,] and أَفْرُسٌ, [a pl. of pauc.<br>\
only,] (O,) and فُرُوسٌ: (K:) and as فَرَسٌ is<br>\
originally fem., you say ثَلَاثُ أَفْرَاسٍ when you<br>\
mean males [as well as when you mean females]:<br>\
(M:) or you say ثَلَاثَةُ أَفْرَاسٍ, with ة, when you<br>\
mean males; and ثَلَاثُ أَفْرَاسٍ, without ة, when<br>\
you mean females: (Msb:) the dim. is فُرَيْسٌ, (S,<br>\
O, Msb,) when applied to the male; (Msb;) and<br>\
↓ فُرَيْسَةٌ, when applied to the female; (S, O, Msb;)<br>\
agreeably with rule; (Msb;) accord. to Aboo-Bekr Ibn-Es-Sarráj: (S, O:) or ↓ فُرَيْسٌ when<br>\
applied to the female [also], which is extr. (Sb,<br>\
M. [See حَرْبٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  هُمَا كَفَرَسَىْ رِهَانٍ [They two<br>\
are like two horses running for a wager] is a<br>\
saying applied to two persons running a race to<br>\
a goal, and being equal: (A, O, K:) the comparison relating to the beginning [of a contest],<br>\
for the termination necessarily shows which outstrips; (O, K:) and to two who are equal, and<br>\
two who are nearly equal, in excellence &amp;c. (Har<br>\
p. 640.) It was said by a man who swore that<br>\
he would abstain from his wife for four months,<br>\
and then divorced her: for the period during<br>\
which a woman may be taken back after a [first<br>\
or second] divorce is that of three menstruations<br>\
or three periods of purity from menstruation; and<br>\
if it ended in this case before the end of the four<br>\
months during which he swore to abstain from<br>\
her, she became separated from him by that<br>\
divorcement: so he likened the two periods to<br>\
two horses running for a wager. (O, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
فَرَسُ البَحْرِ (assumed tropical:)  [The horse of the great river; i. e.,<br>\
of the Nile;] the hippopotamus. (Dmr. [See also<br>\
عَصْبٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  الفَرَسُ (assumed tropical:)  A well-known constellation;<br>\
so called because of its resemblance in form to a<br>\
horse; (M;) [i. e.] الفَرَسُ الأَعْظَمُ (assumed tropical:)  [The Greater,<br>\
or Greatest, Horse;] the constellation Pegasus.<br>\
(Kzw.) ―<br>\
-b5-  قِطْعَةُ الفَرَسِ (assumed tropical:)  [The Piece of the Horse;]<br>\
the constellation Equuleus. (Kzw.) ―<br>\
-b6-  الفَرَسُ التَّامُّ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The Complete horse;] a certain constellation<br>\
composed of thirty-one stars, in which a portion<br>\
of the constellation called الفَرَسُ الأَعْظَمُ is included.<br>\
(Kzw. [It is further described by him; but in a<br>\
manner that does not enable me to identify it<br>\
with any of the constellations named by our<br>\
astronomers.])<br>\
الفَرْسَةُ, (IAar, S, M, O, K, TA,) or ↓ الفِرْسَةُ,<br>\
(M, TA,) the former accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, (M,<br>\
TA,) or, accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, it is with ص, and<br>\
the vulgar, he says, pronounce it with س, (O,)<br>\
Gibbosity [of the back]; syn. الحَدَبُ: (IAar, O,<br>\
TA:) or, (M, O, K, TA,) as also الفَرْصَةُ, (M,<br>\
O,) which latter is the more approved in this<br>\
sense, (M,) the رِيح [or flatus] of gibbosity; (M,<br>\
O, K, TA;) [i. e.] the ريح that renders gibbous;<br>\
(M;) as though it were breaking, or crushing so<br>\
as to break, the back (كَأَنَّهَا تَفْرِسُ الظَّهْرَ أَىْ تَدُقُّهُ),<br>\
and cleaving it (تَفْرِصُهُ أَىْ تَشُقُّهُ): (O:) [or الفَرْسَةُ<br>\
signifies the displacement of one of the vertebræ;<br>\
for,] accord. to As, one says أَصَابَتْهُ فَرْسَةٌ when<br>\
one of the vertebræ of one&#39;s back has become displaced; but the flatus (الرِّيحُ) from which gibbosity results is termed الفَرْصَةُ, with ص: (TA:)<br>\
or الفَرْسَةُ signifies a flatus that attacks in the<br>\
neck, and breaks it: (S:) or, as some say, an<br>\
imposthume, or ulcer, (قَرْحَة,) that is in the neck,<br>\
breaking it: (M:) or a breach (فُرْجَة) in the<br>\
neck; thus says AZ: or a breach (فرجة) that is<br>\
in [the case of] gibbosity: the pl. is فَرَسَاتٌ, not<br>\
أَفْرِسَةٌ, which latter is said to be a pl. of فَرْسَةٌ, but<br>\
is anomalous. (TA.)<br>\
فُرْسَةٌ and فُرْصَةٌ; the latter of which is the more<br>\
approved in both of the following senses; i. q.<br>\
نَوْبَةٌ [meaning A turn; or time at which, or<br>\
during which, a thing is, or is to be, done, or had,<br>\
in succession; as also فُرْزَةٌ: pl. فُرَسٌ]: فُرَسُ الوِرْدِ<br>\
[the turns, or times, for coming to water in succession] means [the occasions of] persons&#39; being<br>\
left free to come to water. (M. [See فُرْصَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And i. q. نُهْزَةٌ [meaning An opportunity; a time<br>\
at which, or during which, a thing may be done,<br>\
or had]. (IAar, M, O.) So in the phrase أَصَابَ<br>\
فُرْسَتَهُ [He got, or obtained, his opportunity]. (M.)<br>\

↓ الفِرْنَوْسُ, a word of a measure not mentioned by<br>\
Sb, (IJ, M,) and ↓ الفُرَانِسُ; (K;) or ↓ الفِرْنَاسُ,<br>\
which is said by IKh to be applied to the lion<br>\
because he is the chief of the beasts of prey, signifies, (O,) or signifies also, (S,) used as an epithet applied to the lion, (S, * M, * O,) and so<br>\
↓ الفُرَانِسُ, (S, * M, O,) the thick-necked, (S, O,)<br>\
that is wont to break the neck of his prey; or the<br>\
former of these two, the rapacious lion; (O;) and<br>\

and فَوَارِسُ, which latter is [more usual, but]<br>\
anomalous, (S, M, O, Msb, K,) for فَوَاعِلُ is [regularly] the measure of the pl. of a sing. of the<br>\

are no instances like فَوَارِسُ except those of هَوَالِكُ<br>\
and نَوَاكِسُ [and خَوَالِفُ and some other words<br>\
enumerated in the Msb and TA]; (S, Msb;) and<br>\
as فوارس is not applied to females, no ambiguity<br>\
is feared from its usage: (S, O:) [ISd says,] we<br>\
have not heard اِمْرَأَةٌ فَارِسَةٌ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (As,)<br>\
or فَارِسٌ عَلَى الخَيْلِ, (S,) A man skilful in horsemanship, or in the management of horses. (As, *<br>\
S.) ―<br>\

[namely, the Persians;] i. q. ↓ الفُرْسُ: (S, O, K:)<br>\
generally fem.: (Msb:) فُرْسٌ is pl. of ↓ فَارِسِىٌّ,<br>\
which is a rel. n. from فَارِسُ in the sense next<br>\
following: (M:) [or, rather, فُرْسٌ is a coll. gen. n.,<br>\
and فَارِسِىٌّ is its n. un.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S, O, but in<br>\
the K “ or ”) The country of the فُرْس; (S, O, K;)<br>\

meaning, The best, (M,) or best and most true,<br>\
(TA,) in فِرَاسَة, [i. e., insight, or intuitive perception, &amp;c.,] of mankind. (M, TA.) One says also,<br>\
أَنَا أَفْرَسُ مِنْكَ I am more endowed with mental<br>\
perception, [or insight, or intuitive perception,]<br>\
and more knowing, than thou. (TA.)<br>\
مَفْرُوسٌ Having the back broken: (M, TA:)<br>\
and so مَفْرُوزٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Humpbacked; as also<br>\
↓ فَرِيْسٌ, (M, TA,) and ↓ أَفْرَسُ (Fr in TA voce<br>\
