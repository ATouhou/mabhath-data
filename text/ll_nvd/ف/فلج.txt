فَلْجٌ an inf. n. of فَلَجَ [q. v.]. (S, O, K, &amp;c.)<br>\
―<br>\

meaning An overcoming in a game of hazard];<br>\

places.<br>\
-A3-  Also, and ↓ فِلْجٌ, (S, O, K,) and ↓ فُلُجٌّ,<br>\

(S, O, K:) pl. of the first and second فُلُوجٌ. (S,<br>\
O.) One says, هُمَا فَلْجَانِ They two are two<br>\

known, (Msb, K,) with which things are divided,<br>\
(TA,) of large size, said to be the same as the<br>\
قَفِيز [q. v.]; and ↓ فَالِجٌ is said to be an arabicized word, from the Syriac فالغا: (L: [but see<br>\
فُلُجٌّ:]) it is said that the ↓ فَالِج [thus in my copy<br>\
of the Mgh, but it is there strangely added that<br>\
it is “ with fet-h,” as though فَالَج,] is two fifths<br>\
of what is termed الكُرُّ المُعَدَّلُ, [see art. كر,] and,<br>\
by &#39;Alee Ibn-&#39;Eesà, that it is larger than the فِلْج:<br>\
in the T, the ↓ فَالِج is said to be the half of the<br>\
great كُرّ; and the فِلْج is the measure of capacity that is called in Syriac فَالَغَا. (Mgh.)<br>\
فَلَجٌ: see فُلْجٌ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  It is also an<br>\

Distance, or width, between the teeth; (K;) as<br>\
also ↓ تَفْلِيجٌ: (TA:) or, between the medial and<br>\
lateral incisors, (T, S, O,) when natural; and<br>\
تَفْلِيجٌ, distance, or width, between those teeth when<br>\
it is the effect of art. (T.) فَلَجٌ in all the teeth<br>\
is disapproved, and not at all beautiful; but it is<br>\
esteemed goodly when only between the two<br>\
middle teeth. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Distance, or width,<br>\
between the feet, (Lth, O, K, TA,) in the posterior<br>\
direction: (O, TA:) or, between the shanks; like<br>\

أَفْلَجُ.]) And The turning over of the foot upon<br>\
the outer side, and displacement of the heel; in a<br>\
neuter sense. (L.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, (S, K,) and, accord.<br>\
to the S, فَلْجٌ, but this is a mistake, (IB, K,) A<br>\

K:) a rivulet, or streamlet; syn. جَدْوَلٌ: (A:)<br>\

for] فُلْجَانٌ signifies rivulets, streamlets, or small<br>\
channels, for the irrigation of seed-produce: and<br>\
↓ فُلُجٌ, with two dammehs, signifies a rivulet,<br>\
streamlet, or small channel, for irrigation, running to every part of a garden. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  فَلَجٌ is<br>\
also sometimes used as an epithet: one says مَآءٌ<br>\
فَلَجٌ meaning Running water: and عَيْنٌ فَلَجٌ a<br>\
running spring of water. (L.)<br>\
-A4-  And الفَلَجُ signifies The daybreak. (TA.)<br>\

also a pl. of فَلِيجٌ [q. v. voce فَلِيجَةٌ].<br>\
فَلْجَةٌ: see فَلِيجَةٌ.<br>\
فُلْجَةٌ: see فُلْجٌ.<br>\
فَلَجَاتٌ Fields, or lands, sown, or for sowing.<br>\

-b2-  See also<br>\
فَلَجٌ, last sentence but two.<br>\
فُلُجٌّ, [thus in the L,] accord. to Sb, A sort of<br>\
men: one says, النَّاسُ فُلُجَّانِ The people, or men,<br>\
are two sorts; [for ex.,] consisting of entering<br>\
and going out: [but I think it most probable that<br>\
فُلُجٌّ and فُلُجَّانِ are mistranscriptions for فِلْجٌ and<br>\
فِلْجَانِ, for] Seer says that فلج signifying “ a<br>\
half ” and “ a sort ” is derived from فِلْجٌ syn.<br>\
with قَفِيزٌ: thus he makes فِلْجٌ an Arabic word.<br>\
(L.) See also فَلْجٌ.<br>\
فِلْجَانٌ, [said to be] from فِلْجٌ signifying “ a<br>\
certain measure of capacity,” [but app. from the<br>\
Pers. فِنْجَان,] A [small porcelain or earthenware]<br>\
cup out of which coffee &amp;c. is drunk; commonly<br>\
pronounced by the vulgar فِنْجَان and فِنْجَال [from<br>\
the Pers. پِنْگَان and پِنْگَال, and also called<br>\

فَليِجَةٌ One of the oblong pieces of cloth of a<br>\
tent: (TA:) or, of a [tent of the kind called]<br>\
خِبَآء: (As, S, O, K:) As says, I know not in<br>\
what part it is: (TA:) ↓ فَلِيجٌ appears to be<br>\
used for it by poetic license; or the word may<br>\
be one of those pronounced with and without ة;<br>\
or without ة it may be a pl. [or coll. gen. n.] of<br>\
which the sing. [or n. un.] is with ة: (M, TA:)<br>\
[or] فَلِيجٌ signifies a single oblong piece of a بِجَاد<br>\
[q. v.]; and its pl. is فُلُجٌ: (L and TA in art.<br>\
بجد:) and [in like manner] ↓ فَلْجَةٌ signifies a<br>\

or paralysis, whether partial or general; hemiplegia or paraplegia:] a disease arising from a<br>\
flaccidity in one of the lateral halves of the body;<br>\
(A;) or a flaccidity in one of the lateral halves<br>\
of the body, (K, TA,) arising suddenly, (TA,)<br>\
occasioned by an efflux of a phlegmatic humour,<br>\
and causing the passages of the spirit to become<br>\
obstructed; (K, TA;) this being its first effect;<br>\
it deprives the patient of his senses and his motion;<br>\
and is sometimes in one member: (TA:) or a<br>\
flatus (رِيحٌ S, O, L, TA) which attacks a man,<br>\
and deprives him [of the use] of one lateral half<br>\
of the body; (thus in the L, and the like is said<br>\
in the &#39;Eyn; TA;) whence it is thus called:<br>\
(IDrd, S, O:) or a disease that arises in one of<br>\
the lateral halves of the body, occasioning the loss<br>\
of the senses and of motion, and sometimes in both<br>\
lateral halves, and sudden in its attack; on the<br>\
seventh [day] it is dangerous; but when it has<br>\
passed the seventh, its acuteness ceases; and when<br>\
it has passed the fourteenth, it becomes a chronic<br>\
disease: (Msb:) it is called in a trad. of Aboo-Hureyreh دَآءُ الأَنْبِيَآءِ [the disease of the prophets]:<br>\
and is said by Et-Tedmuree, in the Expos. of<br>\
the Fs, to be a disease that attacks a man when<br>\
the venters (بُطُون) of the brain become filled with<br>\
certain moistures, or humours, occasioning the loss<br>\

[from the Pers. پِيلَهْ pélah; but said to be] originally فَيْلَق, and thus some pronounce it. (Msb,)<br>\
فِيَالَجَةٌ: see فِلْجَانٌ. [فَيَالِجَة occurs in art. قز<br>\
in the TA, as its pl.; being there expl. as meaning small cups (فَنَاجِين) in which wine (شَرَاب) is<br>\
drunk: but I think that this may be taken from<br>\
a mistranscription for فِيَالَجَة.]<br>\
أَفْلَجُ, (TA,) or أَفْلَجُ الأَسْنَانِ, (S, Mgh, O, K,<br>\
TA,) applied to a man, and فَلْجَآءُ الأَسْنَانِ applied<br>\

that are separate, or distant, or wide apart, one<br>\
from another; and ↓ مُفَلَّجٌ signifies the same [app.<br>\
when they are rendered so artificially: see فَلَجٌ].<br>\
