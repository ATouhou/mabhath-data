word is app. a mistranscription for شِبْكٍ] and<br>\
غَوْث, of the tribe of طَىِّء: it was so termed because one party patched their sandals with the<br>\

they said سَاقِطٌ and سَقْطَى; (S, O;) the pl. being<br>\
made of the same form as هَلْكَى because these two<br>\
words are nearly the same in meaning. (Sb, M.)<br>\
أَفْسَدُ is [a noun denoting the comparative and<br>\
superlative degrees] from الفَسَادُ; as in the prov.,<br>\
أَفْسَدُ مِنْ بَيْضَةِ البَلَدِ i. e. [More corrupt, or unsound, &amp;c.,] than the egg that the ostrich leaves in<br>\
the desert, not returning to it, in consequence of<br>\

الأَمْرِ مَفْسَدَةٌ لِكَذَا [This affair, or event, is cause of<br>\
evil, &amp;c., to such a thing]. (M.) And هُمْ مِنْ<br>\
