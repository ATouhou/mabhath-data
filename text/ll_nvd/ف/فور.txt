-b6-  [And ↓ the<br>\

transcript in the TT, as signifying اِنْتَشَرَ غَضَبُهُ;<br>\

فَوَرَانٌ, The vein became excited, or in a state of<br>\
commotion, and flowed forth [with blood]: (M,<br>\

عَلَى الفَوْرِ [The right of pre-emption is to be had]<br>\
in the present time in which is no delaying. (Msb.)<br>\

They came in a headlong manner; like the phrase<br>\
مَضَى عَلَى وَجْهِهِ]; (M, K, TA; but the M has<br>\

be the meaning of مِنْ فَوْرِهِمْ in the Kur iii. 121:<br>\
(M, TA:) or قَبْلَ أَنْ يَسْكُنُوا [before their resting,<br>\

both being from فَارَ, aor. يَفُورُ. (O.) ―<br>\

إِذَا قَتَلُوا مِنْكُمُ فَارِسًا<br>\
ضَمِنَّا لَهُ بَعْدَهُ أَنْ يَعِيشَا<br>\
(IAar, M, TA. [The text of the M as given in<br>\
the TT, for تَرَى الدَّمَ, has يُرى الدم; and for<br>\
أَنْ يَعِيشَا, it has او يعيشا: and the right reading of<br>\
the first hemistich seems to be, بِضَرْبٍ تُخَفِّتُ فَوَّارَةٍ;<br>\
for an inf. n. is sometimes made fem.: see an instance of ضَرْب as fem. in the EM p. 157: the<br>\
poet means, With a smiting that silences, or kills,<br>\
inflicting a wide and gushing wound; and a piercing with the spear in consequence of which thou<br>\
seest the blood sprinkled: when they slay a horseman of you, we are responsible for him after it<br>\
that he shall live: i. e., as is said in the M, his<br>\
blood shall be revenged, so that he will be as<br>\
though he had not been slain: and it is also there<br>\
said that by يخفّت فوّاره is meant لنها واسعة فدمها<br>\
يسيل ولا صوت له; in which the two fem. pronouns and the fem. epithet all relate to the word<br>\
ضَرْب, agreeably with what I have stated to be<br>\
in my opinion the right reading of the first hemistich.])<br>\
فَيُّورٌ Sharp, as an epithet applied to a man;<br>\
syn. حَدِيدٌ. (O, K.) See also طَيُّورٌ.<br>\
فَوَّارَةٌ, (accord. to the K,) or ↓ فُوَّارَةٌ, (accord. to<br>\
a copy of the M,) A source, or spring, of water:<br>\
(M, K:) [the latter word is app. the right in this<br>\
case; for] IAar says that ↓ فُوَّارَةٌ is applied to a<br>\
wave: and to a بِرْكَة [i. e. watering-trough, or<br>\
the like; or basin, pool, pond; &amp;c.]: and فَوَّارَةٌ,<br>\
to anything that is not water: and in one place<br>\
he says that دَوَّارَةٌ and فَوَّارَةٌ are applied to anything<br>\
that does not move nor turn round; and دُوَّارَةٌ and<br>\
↓ فُوَّارَةٌ to such as moves and turns round. (T,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  فَوَّارَةُ الوَرِكِ, with fet-h and teshdeed,<br>\

ورك [or haunch]: (S, O:) or the فَوَّارَة, (K,) or<br>\
↓ فُوَّارَة, (so in a copy of the M,) is an aperture in<br>\
the وَرِك [or haunch], to the belly, or interior of<br>\
the body, not obstructed by bone: (M, K:) [these<br>\
two explanations plainly apply to the sacroischiatic foramen: but what here follows is consistent with what precedes, though somewhat less<br>\
clear:] or the فَوَّارَتَانِ, (K,) or ↓ فُوَّارَتَانِ, (accord.<br>\
to a copy of the M,) are [two parts, in the region<br>\
of the pelvis, described as being] سِكَّتَانِ [a word<br>\
which I do not find to have any proper meaning<br>\
that would be here apposite, but which seems to be<br>\
applied in this case, by a kind of catachresis, to two<br>\
parts through which a weapon or the like may pass,]<br>\
between [each of] the haunch-bones or hip-bones (بَيْنَ<br>\
الوَرِكَيْنِ) and the قُحْقُح [or ischium], towards<br>\
the side of the وَرِك [or hip-bone], (M, K,) not<br>\
intervening as obstacles in the way to the belly, or<br>\
interior of the body; and they are what become<br>\
in a state of commotion in the act of walking, or<br>\
going along. (M.) [See also الفَائِلُ, in art. فيل]<br>\
And accord. to Lth, the term فَوَّارَتَانِ, (O, and so<br>\
in a copy of the T,) or ↓ فُوَّارَتَانِ, (so in another<br>\
copy of the T,) is applied to Two appertenances<br>\
of the كَرِش [or stomach, properly of a ruminant<br>\
animal], having within them two small nodous<br>\
lumps (غُدَّتَانِ), which latter are not eaten, and<br>\
each of which is a piece of flesh in the midst of<br>\
red flesh. (T, O.)<br>\
فُوَّارَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in six<br>\
places.<br>\
فَائِرٌ [part. n. of 1: ―<br>\
-b2-  hence, فَارَ فَائِرُهُ]: see 1,<br>\
in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  Applied to a beast, of the equine<br>\
and other kinds, Swollen in the sinews; syn. مُنْتَشِرُ<br>\
العَصَبِ. (K. [In the TA, this is said to be a<br>\
mistake for منتشر الغَضَبِ, and thus I find it to be<br>\
written in the L, and in a copy of the M accord.<br>\
to the TT: but see what I have said, in the first<br>\
paragraph of this art., respecting the phrase above<br>\
mentioned.])<br>\
