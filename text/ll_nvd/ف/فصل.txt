فَصَلَ, (S, M, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
فَصِلَ, inf. n. فَصْلٌ,<br>\
(M, Msb, K,) He separated, or divided, (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) and put apart, (Msb,) a thing, (S, O,<br>\
Msb, *) عَنْ غَيْرِهِ [from another thing], (Msb,)<br>\
and بَعْضَهُ مِنْ بَعْضٍ [or عَنْ بَعْضٍ i. e. part thereof<br>\
from part]. (M and TA in art. ميز.) And (K,)<br>\
He made a separation, or partition, (M, K, TA,)<br>\
بَيْنَهُمَا (M, TA *) i. e. between them two, meaning,<br>\
two things, making it known that the former had<br>\
come to an end: so says Er-Rághib: (TA:) and<br>\
فَصَلَ الحَدُّ بَيْنَ الأَرْضَيْنِ, [aor. and] inf. n. as<br>\
above, The limit, or boundary, made, or formed,<br>\
a separation between the two lands: (Msb:) and<br>\
فَصَلْتُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ I made a division, or separation,<br>\
between, or among, the people, or party. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] فَصَلَ الرّضِيعَ عَنْ أُمِّهِ, (S, Mgh, O,) or<br>\
المَوْلُودَ (M, K) عَنِ الرَّضَاعِ, (M,) aor. as above,<br>\
(M, K,) inf. n. فِصَالٌ, (S, O,) or فَصْلٌ, and the<br>\
former is a simple subst., (M, K,) or both, (Mgh,)<br>\
He weaned [the suckling from his mother, or the<br>\
young infant from sucking the breast]; (S, M,<br>\
Mgh, O, K;) as also ↓ افتصلهُ: (S, M, O:) or<br>\
فَصَلَتِ المَرْأَةُ رَضِيعَهَا, inf. n. فَصْلٌ, and فِصَالٌ is<br>\
the subst., the woman weaned her suckling. (Msb.)<br>\

فَصْلُ الخُصُومَاتِ The deciding of litigations, altercations, or disputes: like فَصْلُ الخِطَابِ: (Msb:)<br>\
or this latter means distinct, or plain speech; which<br>\
he to whom it is addressed distinctly, or plainly, understands; which is not confused, or dubious, to him:<br>\
(Ksh in explanation of it in the Kur xxxviii. 19,<br>\
and Mgh:) or such as decides, or distinguishes,<br>\
between what is true and what is false, (Ksh ibid.,<br>\
Mgh, O, K,) and what is sound and what is corrupt, (Ksh, Mgh,) and what is correct and what<br>\
is erroneous: (Ksh:) or such as decides the judgment, or judicial sentence: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or<br>\
the evidence, or proof, that is obligatory [as a condition of his justification] upon the claimant, or<br>\
plaintiff, and the oath that is obligatory [in like<br>\
manner] upon him against whom the claim, or<br>\
plaint, is urged; (Ksh, O, K; [an explanation<br>\
of which a part is dropped in the CK;]) thus<br>\
accord. to &#39;Alee: (Ksh:) or the [using of the]<br>\
phrase أَمَّا بَعْدُ. (Ksh, O, K. [Respecting this<br>\
phrase, and for other explanations, see 3 in art<br>\
خطب.]) كَلِمَةُ الفَصْلِ in the Kur xlii. 20 means<br>\
The sentence of God&#39;s deciding between mankind<br>\
on the day of resurrection, (O,) which is called<br>\
يَوْمُ الفَصْلِ. (TA.) And الفَصْلُ [alone] means The<br>\
deciding judicially between what is true and what<br>\
is false; (M, O, K;) and, (O, K,) sometimes,<br>\
(O,) so ↓ الفَيْصَلُ; (S, O, K;) or this latter is [a<br>\
simple subst, i. e.,] a name for such decision;<br>\
(TA;) and is also an epithet [expl. below]. (M,<br>\
O, K.) هٰذَا يَوْمُ الدِّينِ هٰذَا يَوْمُ الْفَصْلِ, in the Kur<br>\
xxxvii. 20 and 21, means [This is the day of requital:] this is the day wherein a decision, or a<br>\
distinction, shall be made (يُفْصَلُ فِيهِ) between the<br>\
doer of good and the doer of evil, and every one<br>\
shall be requited for his work and with that wherewith God will favour his servant the Muslim. (M.)<br>\
And إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ يَفْصِلُ بَيْنَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِيمَا كَانُوا<br>\
فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ, in the Kur xxxii. 25, means [Verily<br>\
thy Lord] He shall decide [between them], and<br>\
distinguish what is true from what is false, [on the<br>\
day of resurrection,] by distinguishing the speaker<br>\
of what is true from the speaker of what is false,<br>\
in respect of that wherein they used to disagree,<br>\
of what concerned religion. (Bd.) And one says<br>\
also فَصَلَ الحُكْمَ [He decided the judgment, or<br>\
judicial sentence]. (M.) فَصَلَ النَّظْمَ, in the K, is a<br>\
mistake: see 2. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  فَصَلَ مِنَ النَّاحِيَةِ, (S, O,)<br>\
or مِنْ البَلَدِ (K,) or عَنْ بَلَدِكَذَا, aor.<br>\

n. فُصُولٌ, (M, K,) He went forth [from the part of<br>\
the country, or from the town or country, or from<br>\
such a town or country]. (S, O, K.) And فَصَلَ<br>\
العَسْكَرُ عَنِ البَلَدِ [The army went forth from the<br>\
town or country]: whence the saying of the Prophet respecting Ibn-Rawáhah, كَانَ أَوَّلَنَا فُصُولًا<br>\
وَآخِرُنَاقُفُولًا i. e. He was the first of us in going<br>\
away (↓ اِنْفِصَالًا) from his house and his family<br>\

(Mgh.) And فَصَلَ فُلَانٌ مِنْ عِنْدِى, inf. n. فُصُولٌ,<br>\
Such a one went forth [from my presence or<br>\
vicinage, or from me]. (TA.) And فَصَلَ مِنِّى<br>\
كِتَابُ إِلَيْهِ [A letter] passed from me to him.<br>\
(TA.) Thus the verb is intrans, as well as trans.;<br>\
its inf. n. when it is trans, being فَصْلٌ; when<br>\
intrans., فُصُولٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فَصَلَ الكَرْمُ The<br>\
vine put forth small grapes, resembling lentils or a<br>\
grain similar thereto. (M, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
فصّل النَّظْمَ, (M, TA,) thus correctly, with<br>\
teshdeed, bat in the K فَصَلَ, like نَصَرَ, (TA,)<br>\
[inf. n. تَفْصِيلٌ,] He put between every two of the<br>\
strung beads [or pearls] a bead such as is termed<br>\
فَاصِلَةٌ [q. v., or what is described voce مُفَصّلٌ as<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  And فصّلتُ الشّىْءَ inf. n. تَفْصِيلٌ, I made the<br>\
thing to consist of distinct portions or sections.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فصّل الشّاةَ, (inf. n. as above,<br>\
TA.) He (a butcher) divided the sheep, or goal,<br>\
into limbs, or members. (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence<br>\
فصّل means also He cut a piece of cloth for a<br>\
garment: and he cut out a garment: ―<br>\
-b5-  whence<br>\
تَفْصِيلٌ means The cut of a garment (See also<br>\
De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Ar., see. ed., i. 86-7.)] ―<br>\
-b6-  And<br>\
[hence, likewise,] تَفْصِيلٌ also signifies [The dissecting, or analyzing, of speech, or language: the<br>\
explaining distinctly, or in detail: and] the making<br>\
distinct, clear, plain, manifest, or perspicuous;<br>\
i. q. تَبْيِينٌ. (S, O, K.) فَصَّلْنَاهُ in the Kur vii.<br>\
50 [referring to the book of the Kur an] means<br>\
بيّنَّاهُ [Which we have made distinct, &amp;c.]: or, as<br>\
some say, whereof we have divided the verses by<br>\
means of the فَوَاصِل [pl. of فَاصِلةٌ, q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\

فَاْصَلَ فاصل شَرِيكَهُ, (S, K, TA,) inf. n. مُفَاصَلَةٌ,<br>\
(TA,) He separated himself from his partner,<br>\
with the latter&#39;s concurrence; syn. بَايَنَهُ, (K, TA,)<br>\
and فَارَزَهُ. (S and O and K in art. فرز.)<br>\
7<br>\
انفصل It became separated, or divided, (S,<br>\
M, O, Msb, K,) and put apart (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And<br>\
He went forth, or away; like the intrans. فَصَلَ.]<br>\
See 1, near the end.<br>\

إِفْتَصَلَ see 1, former half. ―<br>\
-b2-  افتصل النَّخْلَةَ عَنْ<br>\
مَوْضِعِهَا He transplanted the palm-tree. (AHn,<br>\
M, K.) A man of Hejer [which is famous for<br>\
its dates] said that the best of palm-trees is that<br>\
of which the young one has been removed from<br>\
its place of growth, which young one is called<br>\
↓ فَصْلَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
فَصْلٌ inf. n. of the trans. v. فَصَلَ [q. v. passim].<br>\
(M, Msb, K, TA.) [As a simple subst., it has<br>\
various significations here following: and is] sing.<br>\
of فُصُولٌ. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A separation, division, or<br>\
partition, between two things. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The<br>\
place of the مَفْصِل [i. e. joint, or articulation, and<br>\
therefore of the division, of two bones] of the body:<br>\
between every one such and another [that is the<br>\
next to it] is a وِصْل [or limb, in the CK, erroneously, وَصْل]. (Lth, O, K.) See also مَفْصِلٌ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  As used by the Basrees, [in grammar,] it is<br>\
[A disconnective] like عِمَادٌ as used by the Koofees: (O, K:) thus in the saying in the Kur<br>\
[viii. 32], إنْ كَانَ هٰذَا هُوَ الْحَقَّ مِنْ عِنْدِكَ [lit.<br>\
If this, it, be the truth from Thee], هو is termed<br>\
فصل and عماد, [more commonly the former,] and<br>\
الحقّ is in the accus. case as being the predicate<br>\
of كان. (O.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also sing. of فُصُول in the<br>\
phrase فُصُولُ السَّنَةِ [The four divisions of the year:<br>\
namely autumn, winter, spring, and summer],<br>\
expl. in art. زمن. (Msb: see زَمَنٌ.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And A<br>\
division, or section, of a باب [or chapter]; as being<br>\
divided from others, or as forming a division<br>\
between itself and others, so that it has the meaning of the measure مَفْعُولٌ or that of the measure<br>\
فَاعِلٌ. (MF, TA.) ―<br>\

-A2-  [It is also used as an epithet;] One say (??)<br>\
فَصْلٌ A true say or saying: (M, K;) not false:<br>\
thus in the Kur [lxxxvi. 15]: (M.) or (??)<br>\
there means distinguishing between what is true<br>\
and what is false: and relates to the Kur án<br>\
[itself]. (Ksh, Bd, Jel.) And it is said of the<br>\
speech of the Prophet that it was فَصَلٌ لَانَزْرٌ وَلَا<br>\
هَذَرٌ, (O, TA, but in the latter هَذْرٌ [to assimilate<br>\
it in form to نَزْرٌ],) meaning Distinct, (O, TA,)<br>\
clear, or plain, distinguishing between what is<br>\
true and what is false; (TA;) not little are<br>\

TA,) meaning And the period of the bearing of<br>\
him in the womb and thenceforward to the end of<br>\
the time of the weaning of him is thirty months.<br>\

mother: (S, M, Mgh, * O, K, TA:) and some<br>\
times such a young one of the bovine kind: (TA:)<br>\
[and by a proleptic application,] a young camel [in<br>\
a general sense], because he is, or will be, weaned<br>\
from his mother: (Msb:) [in the T, voce حُوَارٌ,<br>\
and in other lexicons &amp;c., it is applied to a young,<br>\
newly-born, camel: and in the L, voce سُخْدٌ, to<br>\
a fœtus in a she-camel&#39;s belly: see an ex. of its<br>\
meaning a young sucking camel (one of many<br>\
such exs.) in the first paragraph of art. رجل;<br>\
and a strange similar usage of the first of the following pls. in a verse cited voce خَسْفٌ:] the pl.<br>\
is فُصْلَانٌ, (Sb, S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) agreeably with rule, (Sb, M,) and فِصْلَانٌ, (Sb, Fr,<br>\
M, Msb, K,) formed by likening the sing. to<br>\
غُرَابٌ, of which غِرْبَانٌ is a pl., (Sb, M,) and فِصَالٌ,<br>\
(Sb, S, M, Msb, K,) as though it were an epithet,<br>\
(Sb, M, Msb,) like كَرِيمٌ, of which كِرَامٌ, is a<br>\
pl.: (Msb:) and the female is termed فَصِيلَةٌ.<br>\
(M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A حَائِط [or wall of enclosure],<br>\

than the قَبِيلَة: (TA:) [see شَعْبٌ in two places:]<br>\
or the nearest to him of the آبَآء [meaning male<br>\
ancestors and including paternal uncles] of a man:<br>\
(Th, M, K, TA:) [or any one of such persons;<br>\
for] El-&#39;Abbás [one of Mohammad&#39;s paternal<br>\
uncles] was called فَصِيلَةُ النَّبِيِّ: the term is like<br>\
the مَفْصِل in relation to the human foot. (TA.)<br>\
جَاؤُوا بِفَصِيلَتِهِمْ means They came, all of them, or<br>\
all together. (S, O.)<br>\

فَاصِلٌ [as an act. part. n.] Separating; dividing; or making a separation, or partition. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in a trad., مَنْ أَنْفَقَ نَفَقَةً فَاصِلَةً<br>\
فِى سَبِيل اللّٰهِ فَهِىَ بِسَبْعِمِائَة ضِعَفٍ, (S, * O, K, *)<br>\
meaning [Whoso expends expense] such as distinguishes between his belief and his unbelief [i. e.<br>\
such as distinguishes him as a believer, it shall be<br>\
rewarded with seven hundred fold]: (S, O, K,<br>\
TA:) or, as some say, such as he cuts off from<br>\
his property. (TA.) And one says كَلَامٌ فَاصِلٌ<br>\
(K and TA in art. فرز) and ↓ فَيْصَلٌ (A ibid.)<br>\
i. q. فَارِزٌ (O and K, and TA ibid.) i. e. Discriminating language. (TA ibid.) And حُكْمٌ فَاصِلٌ<br>\
and ↓ فَيْصَلٌ [A judgment, or judicial sentence,<br>\

↓ طَعْنَةٌ فَيْصَلٌ [An act of piercing or thrusting<br>\

applied to God, الفَاصِلُ means The Decider<br>\
between the خَلْق [i. e. the human race, or these<br>\

And [hence] it signifies (assumed tropical:)  A judge, one who decides<br>\
judicially, an arbiter, or arbitrator; (S, O, K;)<br>\

sense a tropical intensive appellation. (TA.)<br>\

forms a separation, or division, between the pair<br>\
of [other] beads [i. e. between every two other beads]<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] فَوَاصِلُ, of which it is the sing.,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The final words of the verses of the Kur-án, (O,<br>\
K,) and of the clauses of rhyming prose [in general], (Msb and K and TA in art. سجع,) that are<br>\

K:) a single one of the مَفَاصِل of the limbs or<br>\
members: (S, O, Msb, K:) [a joint such as the<br>\
elbow and knee and knuckle: and sometimes a<br>\
joint as meaning a bone having an articulation<br>\
at each end, or at one end, together with the flesh<br>\
that is upon it:] in a trad. in which it is said that<br>\
the mulct for any مَفْصِل of a human being is the<br>\
third of the mulct for the [whole] finger, it means<br>\
the مَفْصِل of any of the fingers or toes; i. e. the<br>\
portion between any أَنْمَلَتَانِ [here meaning two<br>\
knuckles; but this is a loose and an imperfect<br>\
explanation; for to it should be added, and also<br>\
the ungual portion, or portion in which is the nail;<br>\
for the word is here applied to denote any of the<br>\
phalanges with the flesh that is upon it: in the T<br>\
&amp;c., in art. نمل, one of the explanations of الأَنْمَلَةُ<br>\
is “ the مَفْصِل in which is the nail ”]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And [hence] one says, يَأْتِيكَ بِالأَمْرِ مِنْ مَفْصِلِهِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [He will tell thee the thing, or affair, tracing it<br>\
from the point on which it turns, or hinges; (like<br>\
as one says, مِنْ فَصِّهِ, q. v.;) or], from its utmost<br>\
point or particular, i. e., مُنْتَهَاهُ. (Msb.) [This<br>\
saying may be originally a hemistich, thus:<br>\
وَيَأْتِيكَ بِالأَمْرِ مِنْ مَفْصِلِهْ<br>\
like the similar saying ending with فَصِّهِ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  In<br>\
the following saying of Aboo-Dhu-eyb, [the<br>\

forth has been recent, such milk being mixed with<br>\
water like the water of the مفاصل], المَفَاصِل<br>\
(which is pl. of مَفْصِلٌ, S, O) signifies (accord. to<br>\
As, S, O) the place of separation (↓ مُنْفَصَل) of<br>\

having between them crushed and small pebbles, so<br>\
that the water thereof is clear, (S, M, O,) and<br>\
glistens, (وَيَبْرُقُ, S, O,) or and is shallow; (وَيَرِقُّ;)<br>\
the poet meaning to describe the clearness of the<br>\
water because of its descending from the mountain and not passing by dust nor earth: (M:) or<br>\
it signifies hard stones (M, K) compactly disposed,<br>\
or heaped up: (M, K: in the former, مُتَرَاصِفَة:<br>\
in the latter, مُتَرَاكِمَة:) and (M, K) it is said to<br>\
signify (M) what is between two mountains, (M,<br>\

water whereof is clear: (K:) or, accord. to AO,<br>\
the water-courses of a valley: (O:) accord. to<br>\
Abu-l-&#39;Omeythil, the clefts in mountains, from<br>\
which water flows; and only said of what are<br>\
between two mountains: in the T, the مَفْصِل is<br>\
said to be any place, in a mountain, upon which<br>\
the sun does not rise: (TA:) and it is said that<br>\
مَآءُ المَفَاصِلِ means what flows from between the<br>\
two joints (مِنْ بَيْنِ المَفْصِلَيْنِ) when one of them<br>\
is cut from the other; like clear water; and the<br>\
sing. is مَفْصِلٌ: (M:) AA says that the مفاصل in<br>\
the verse are the مفاصل of the bones; and that it<br>\
likens that water to the مآء of the flesh: (O, TA:)<br>\
