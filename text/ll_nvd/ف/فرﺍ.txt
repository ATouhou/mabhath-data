load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'فرأفَرَأْ (T, S, M, O, K) and ↓ فَرَآءٌ, (K,) both of<br>\
these forms authorized by the Koofees, (TA,) A<br>\
wild ass: (ISk, T, S, M, O, K:) or a youthful<br>\
wild ass: (M, K:) but the absolute [i. e. the<br>\
former] meaning is that which is commonly<br>\
known: (TA:) pl. (of mult., TA) فِرَآءٌ (T, S, M,<br>\
O, K) and (of pauc., TA) أَفْرَآءٌ. (M, K.) Hence<br>\
the saying, كُلُّ الصَّيدِ فِى جَوْفِ الفَرَا [Every kind<br>\
of game is in the belly (or might enter into the<br>\
belly) of the wild ass]; (T, S, M, O, K;) meaning that every kind of game is inferior to the<br>\
wild ass: (T, O, K:) a prov., (T, S, M, K,) and<br>\
therefore [the last word is] without hemz, on<br>\
account of the final pause; (K;) but some write<br>\
it with hemz: (TA:) it is said to have originated<br>\
from the fact that three men went forth to hunt;<br>\
and one caught a hare; and another, a gazelle;<br>\
and the third, a wild ass; and the first and second<br>\
boasted against the third, who thereupon said as<br>\
above: it is applied to him who excels his fellows:<br>\
(Meyd:) or to a man who is, with respect to<br>\
other men, as the wild ass with respect to other<br>\
kinds of game: or to the case of a man who,<br>\
having several wants, one of which is a great<br>\
one, accomplishes that great want, and cares not<br>\
for the others&#39; being unaccomplished. (T, TA.<br>\
[See also Har pp. 468-9.]) And أَنْكَحْنَا الفَرَا<br>\
فَسَنَرَى [We have married our daughter to the<br>\
wild ass, and we shall see,] (T, S, M, O) is<br>\
another prov.; (T, Meyd;) in which alif is substituted for the hemzeh, (S, M, * O,) for the purpose of the agreement [of الفَرَا in rhyme] with<br>\
سَنَرَى: (M:) said by a man to his wife when a<br>\
man demanded in marriage his daughter and he<br>\
refused, but his wife consented, and overcame the<br>\
father so that he gave her in marriage to him<br>\
against his wish; then the husband made the<br>\
intercourse [with her] to be evil, and divorced<br>\
her: it is applied in cautioning against an evil<br>\
consequence: (Meyd:) or it is applied to a man<br>\
when his affair has been endangered and he has<br>\
seen what he does not like; and it means we<br>\
have wasted our precaution, and the affair has<br>\
brought us to an evil result; (As, T;) or we have<br>\
considered the affair, and we shall see what it<br>\
will disclose; (T;) or we have sought after high<br>\
things, and we shall see what our case will be<br>\
afterwards. (Th, M.)<br>\
