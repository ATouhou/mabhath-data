way: (see what follows:)] and a mode, or manner:<br>\
(MA:) pl. [of mult.] فُنُونٌ (T, S, M, Msb, K)<br>\
and [of pauc.] أَفْنَانٌ. (T, M, K.) One says,<br>\

various sorts of herbage]: and أَصَبْنَا فُنُونَ الأَمْوَالِ<br>\
[We obtained the various sorts of possessions]: and<br>\
a poet says,<br>\
قَدْ لَبِسْتُ الدَّهْرَ مِنْ أَفْنَانِهِ<br>\
كُلُّ فَنٍّ نَاعِمٍ مِنْهُ حَبِرْ<br>\
[I have enjoyed of the various sorts of fortune,<br>\
every pleasant, soft, sort thereof]. (T.) [↓ أُفْنوُنٌ<br>\
has for its pl. أَفَانِيْنُ, which may also be regarded<br>\
as pl. of أَفْنَانٌ pl. of فَنٌّ like as it is said to be<br>\
a pl. pl. of فَنَنٌ: and] أَفَانِينُ [alone], (S,) or<br>\
أَفَانِينُ كَلَامٍ, (TA,) signifies kinds [or sorts], and<br>\
ways, or modes, or manners, [i. e. diversities, or<br>\

Different sorts of men, or a medley thereof, not<br>\

-b2-  Also A wonderful thing or<br>\
affair or case. (S, TA.)<br>\
هُوَ فِنُّ عِلْمٍ He is [a good student of science, i. e.]<br>\
one who occupies himself well with science. (K.)<br>\
فَنَّةٌ مِنَ الدَّهْرِ A particular period of time; [or<br>\
a particular time;] as also فَيْنَةٌ. (T, K. *) The<br>\
Arabs say, كُنْتُ بِحَالِ كَذَا وَكَذَا فَنَّةً مِنَ الدَّهْرِ<br>\
and فَيْنَةً مِنَالدَّهْرِ [I was in such and such a state,<br>\
or condition, at, or during, a particular time].<br>\
(T.)<br>\
فُنَّةٌ Much, or abundance, of herbage. (IAar, K.)<br>\
فَنَنٌ A branch of a tree: (S, M, Msb, K:) or<br>\
such as is of just proportion in length or in breadth:<br>\
(T:) said to be syn. with غُصْنٌ; but this latter<br>\
signifies “ such as has been cut off ” i. q. قَضِيبٌ<br>\
meaning مَقْضُوبٌ: (M:) pl. أَفْنَانٌ; (T, S, M, Msb,<br>\
K;) said by Sb to be its only pl.; (M;) occurring<br>\
in the Kur lv. 48; where some explain it as pl.<br>\
of فَنٌّ, and meaning “ sorts,” or “ species ”; others,<br>\
as pl. of فَنَنٌ: (T, Bd:) and أَفَانِينُ is a pl. pl.,<br>\
(T, S, K,) i. e. pl. of أَفْنَانٌ. (T, S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And as a<br>\
branch shelters like as does darkness, a poet uses<br>\
it metaphorically, saying,<br>\
أَغَاثَ شَرِيدَهُمْ فَنَنُ الظَّلَامِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [The shelter of the darkness aided him, or them,<br>\
who fled]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [in like manner also]<br>\
the pl. pl. is used in a trad. describing the<br>\
inmates of Paradise, as meaning (tropical:)  Locks of hair;<br>\
these being likened to branches: and El-Marrár<br>\
says,<br>\
أَعَلَاقَةً أُمَّ الوَلِيدِ بَعْدَمَا<br>\
أَفْنَانُ رَأْسِكَ كَالثَّغَامِ المُخْلِسِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Dost thou feel attachment of love to Umm-ElWeleed after that the locks of thy head have<br>\
become like the hoary thaghám?]; meaning the<br>\
locks of the hair of his head when he had become<br>\
hoary. (T. [See ثَغَامٌ.])<br>\
فَنِينٌ A humour in the armpit [of a camel],<br>\
with pain. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A camel having the<br>\
tumour thus called; as also ↓ مَفْنُونٌ. (M, K.)<br>\
شَجَرَةٌ فَنَّآءُ and فَنْوَآءُ, which latter is anomalous,<br>\
A tree having branches; (S;) the latter thus expl.<br>\
by AA; but by rule it should be فَنَّآءُ: (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
T:) or the latter, which is anomalous, signifies<br>\
having long branches: (M:) or both signify having<br>\
many branches. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] اِمْرَأَةٌ فَنْوَآءُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A woman having much hair: but in this case,<br>\
as in the former, the epithet, by rule, should be<br>\
فَنَّآءُ. (M.) [See also فَيْنَانٌ.]<br>\
فَنَّانٌ A wild ass that has various sorts, or<br>\
modes, of running: (S, K:) used in this sense in<br>\
the poetry of El-Aashà. (S.) [See also مِفَنٌّ.]<br>\
شَعَرٌ فَيْنَانٌ (assumed tropical:)  Hair having locks [lit. branches<br>\
(أَفْنَان)] (M, * K) like the أَفْنَان of trees; [the<br>\
latter word properly signifying having many<br>\
branches, (see Ham p. 622,) of the measure فَيْعَالٌ,<br>\
not فَعْلَان;] therefore it is perfectly decl.: so says<br>\
Sb: (M:) or it signifies long and beautiful hair;<br>\
the latter word being of the measure فَيْعَالٌ from<br>\
الفَنَنُ, and the ى augmentative. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
one says also, agreeably with analogy, رَجُلٌ فَيْنَانٌ,<br>\
(M,) and اِمْرَأَةٌ فَيْنَانَةٌ, (M, K,) meaning [A man,<br>\
and a woman,] having much hair; (K;) for<br>\
فَيْنَان is perfectly decl., derived from أَفْنَانُ الشَّجَرِ:<br>\
IAar has mentioned اِمْرَأَةٌ فَيْنَى meaning [a<br>\
woman] having much hair; and if the phrase be<br>\
thus, فَيْنَان must be imperfectly decl.; but [ISd<br>\
says] I regard this as a mistake of IAar. (M.)<br>\
[See also art. فين.]<br>\
أُفْنُونٌ: see فَنٌّ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also A<br>\
tangled, or luxuriant, or dense, branch. (T, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And Obscure, indistinct, or confused, speech,<br>\
(T, K,) of a foolish, stupid, or dull, person. (T.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And A mixed, or confused, run, of a horse<br>\
and of a she-camel. (T, K.)<br>\
-A3-  Also A serpent.<br>\
(T, M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And An old woman: so some<br>\
say: (M:) or an old woman advanced in age:<br>\
(T, K:) or one who is flaccid, or flabby: (K:)<br>\
Yaakoob has explained it as having the first of<br>\
these three meanings; but IB regards this as<br>\
improbable, because a verse of Ibn-Ahmar which<br>\
is cited as an ex. thereof is preceded by what<br>\
shows that it is applied to his beloved. (TA.)<br>\
[It is said in the M to be also the proper name<br>\
of a certain woman; and as such it may be used<br>\
by Ibn-Ahmar.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And i. q. دَاهِيَةٌ [A calamity,<br>\
or misfortune, &amp;c.]: (M, K:) so some say. (M.)<br>\
-A4-  And The first part of youth, or youthfulness;<br>\
and of clouds. (M, K.)<br>\
مِفَنٌّ A man who has various sorts, or modes,<br>\
[i. e. diversities, or varieties,] of speech; (T, TA;)<br>\
and so ↓ مُتَفَنِّنٌ: (S:) or a man who utters, or<br>\
performs, wonderful things: (S, K, TA:) fem.<br>\
with ة. (T, S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A horse that performs various sorts, or modes, of running. (TA.)<br>\
مُفَنَّنٌ A garment, or piece of cloth, diversified;<br>\
not uniform. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Old, and evil in<br>\
disposition, as an epithet applied to a man: (M:)<br>\
and so with ة applied to a woman. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also, with ة, A she-camel that seems to one to<br>\
have been ten months pregnant, ثُمَّ تَنْكَشِفُ مَنَ<br>\
الكِشَافِ [app. meaning then suffers, or exposes,<br>\
herself to be compressed; from الكِشَافُ as inf. n.<br>\
of كَشَفَت said of a she-camel: compare تنكشف<br>\
as here used with تَكْتَشِفُ said of a woman]. (K.)<br>\
مَفْنُونٌ: see فَنِينٌ.<br>\
مُتَفَنِّنُ: see مِفَنٌّ.<br>\
