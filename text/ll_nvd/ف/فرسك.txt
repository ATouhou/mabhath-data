malum Persicum, which is generally applied to<br>\
the former fruit; or amydalus Persica of Linn.,<br>\

of the dial. of El-Yemen: (TA:) or a sort thereof,<br>\
(K,) i. q. فِرْسِقٌ, which is like the خَوْخ in size,<br>\
(Lth, O,) أَجْرَدُ [which here means without down,<br>\
and for which Golius and Freytag appear to<br>\
have read أَجْوَدُ], smooth, red [accord. to the CK<br>\
“ or red ”], (Lth, O, K, TA,) and yellow, the<br>\
flavour of which is like that of the خَوْخ: (Lth,<br>\
O, TA:) or [a cling-stone peach or nectarine; i. e.]<br>\
a sort of خَوْخ that does not cleave asunder from<br>\
its stone: (S, O:) or [a free-stone peach or nectarine; i. e.] such as cleaves asunder from its<br>\
stone. (K.)<br>\
