فَرِثَ, (M,) or both,<br>\
(ISk, S, K,) inf. n. فَرْثٌ, (T, M,) He scattered,<br>\
or dispersed, [the contents of] the جُلَّة [or receptacle<br>\
made of palm-leaves, for dates]: (T, * K:) or ripped<br>\
the جُلَّة, and then scattered, or dispersed, its contents, (ISk, S, M, O,) entirely, (M,) لِلْقَومِ [for<br>\
the people, or party]. (ISk, S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And in<br>\
like manner, (M,) فَرَثَ كَبِدَهُ, (ISk, T, S, M, O,<br>\
K,) aor.<br>\

inf. n. فَرْثٌ; (S, O;) and ↓ فَرَّثَهَا, (ISk, S, M, O,<br>\
K,) inf. n. تَفْرِيثٌ; (ISk, S, O, K;) He struck,<br>\
or smote, him, (ISk, T, S, O,) or his liver, (K,)<br>\
he being alive, (ISk, S, O, K,) so that his liver<br>\
became scattered. (ISk, T, S, O, K.) And [hence]<br>\
one says, فَرَثَ الحُبُّ كَبِدَهُ, and ↓ فَرَّثَهَا, and ↓ افرثها,<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  Love crumbled [or crushed] his liver:<br>\
[like as we say “ it broke his heart: ”] (M, TA:)<br>\

I ripped the كرش, and scattered what was in it.<br>\
(M, TA.) Accord. to the K, one says, افرث الكَبِدَ,<br>\
meaning He ripped the كبد [or liver], and threw<br>\
away the فُرَاثَة, i. e., what was in it: but this is<br>\
taken from two passages in the M and T, which<br>\
the author of the K has confounded. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And [hence, app.,] افرث أَصْحَابَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He exposed<br>\
his companions (T, S, M, O, K) to the ruling<br>\
power, (T,) or to the censure of men: (T, S, M,<br>\
O, K:) or he pronounced them to be liars, in the<br>\
presence of a people, or party, in order to lessen<br>\
them in their estimation: or he exposed to reproach their secret: (M:) or he calumniated, or<br>\
slandered, them. (IF, O.) And افرث الرَّجُلَ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
reviled, vilified, or vituperated, the man; charged<br>\
him with a vice, fault, or the like; defamed him;<br>\
or detracted from his reputation. (M, O.) ―<br>\

only the inf. n. is mentioned; in a copy of the T<br>\
written فَرَث; in the K, فَرْث, and so in a copy of<br>\
the A; [accord. to the TK, the pret. is فَرَثَتْ, and<br>\
the aor. تَفْرُثُ; but is probably only inferred from<br>\
the form of the inf. n. in the K;]) She had a<br>\
heaving of the soul [or stomach], or a tendency to<br>\
vomit. (T, A, O, K. *) [And] اُنْفُرِثَ بِهَا She<br>\
(a woman, in the beginning of her pregnancy,)<br>\

of the soul [or stomach], or a tendency to vomit.<br>\

the dregs in the كرش: (Jel in xvi. 68:) or i. q.<br>\
سِرْقِين [a dial. var. of سرجين]: and the سرقين<br>\
of the كرش; as also ↓ فُرَاثَةٌ, (M,) [i. e.] الفُرَاثَةُ<br>\
signifies what is extracted from the كرش [like<br>\
الفَرْثُ: it is erroneously expl. in the K: see 4]:<br>\
(O:) the pl. of فَرْثٌ is فُرُوثٌ. (S, O.) ―<br>\

إِنَّهَا لَمُنْفَرَثٌ بِهَا, said of a pregnant woman,<br>\
Verily she is affected with a heaving of the soul [or<br>\
stomach], or a tendency to vomit, (O, K, * TA, *) by<br>\
reason of the heaviness of pregnancy: (O:) [or]<br>\
one says of a woman in the beginning of her<br>\
pregnancy, ↓ إنَّهَا لَمُتَفَرِّثَةٌ, meaning [Verily] she is<br>\
affected with a heaving of the soul [or stomach],<br>\
or a tendency to vomit, and the phlegm at the head<br>\
of her stomach is much in quantity: so says ISk,<br>\
on the authority of AA: but [Az, after citing<br>\
this, adds,] I know not whether it be مُنْفَرِثَةٌ or<br>\
↓ مُتَفَرِّثَةٌ: (T, TA: *) and ↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ فَرْثٌ, (M, TA,<br>\
[in the former, as given in the TT, the latter<br>\

spits, [or expectorates phlegm,] and has a heaving<br>\
