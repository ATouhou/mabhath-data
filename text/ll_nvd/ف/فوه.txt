فَاهَ بِهِ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. يَفُوهُ (S, Msb) and<br>\
يَفِيهُ also, (ISd, TA,) inf. n. فَوْهٌ, (MA,) [and<br>\
inf. n. of unity فَوْهَةٌ, (see Har p. 434,)] He uttered it, or pronounced it, (S, Msb, K,) namely,<br>\
a saying; (S;) as also ↓ تفوّه. (S, K.) One says,<br>\
مَا فُهْتُ بِكَلِمَةٍ, and ↓ ما تَفَوَّهْتُ, i. e. I opened not<br>\
my mouth with a word, or sentence. (S.) فَاهَ لِسَانٌ,<br>\
a phrase used by El-Hareeree, the Arabs did not<br>\
say: they only said, فاه الرَّجُلُ بِكَذَا [The man<br>\
opened his mouth with such a thing, i. e., with such<br>\
a saying, &amp;c.]. (Har p. 191.) And هٰذَا أَمْرٌ مَا<br>\
فُهْتُ عَنْهُ, inf. n. فُوُوهٌ [or فُؤُوهٌ ?], is a saying mentioned by Fr, as meaning This is a thing, or an<br>\
affair, which I mentioned not, or have not mentioned. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2.<br>\
-A2-  فَوِهَ, aor. يَفْوَهُ,<br>\
[inf. n. فَوَهٌ,] He (a man) had what is termed<br>\
↓ فَوَهٌ, (S, TA,) which means width of the mouth,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) and largeness thereof: (TA:) or<br>\
protrusion and length of the upper central incisors:<br>\
(S, TA:) or length of all the teeth; length of the<br>\
upper central incisors being termed رَوَقٌ: (IB,<br>\
TA:) or protrusion of the teeth from the lips,<br>\
with length thereof. (K, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
فوّههُ He (i. e. God) made him to be أَفْوَه [or<br>\
wide in the mouth, &amp;c.]. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  شَدَّ مَا فَوَّهْتَ<br>\
فِى هٰذَا الطَّعَامِ, [thus accord. to the TA, but an<br>\
explanation of مُفَوَّهٌ seems to show that the right<br>\
reading is فُوِّهْتَ, in the pass. form,] and ↓ تَفَوَّهْتَ,<br>\
and ↓ فُهْتَ, means شَدَّ مَا أَكَلْتَ [app. Much<br>\
indeed, or greatly indeed, didst thou eat, or hast<br>\
thou eaten, of this food; see شَدَّ: and see also<br>\
10]. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
فاوههُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. مُفَاوَهَةٌ; (TA;) and<br>\
فَاهَاهُ, [formed from the former by transposition,]<br>\
(K, TA,) inf. n. مُفَاهَاةٌ; (TA;) He talked, or<br>\
discoursed, with him: [see also 6:] and he contended with him for superiority in glory, or excellence. (K, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تفوّه He spoke. (KL.) See also 1, first and<br>\
second sentences. ―<br>\
-b2-  And see 2.<br>\
-A2-  تفوّه المَكَانَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He entered the فُوَّهَة of the place; (K, TA;)<br>\
i. e., the mouth thereof; likened to the فَم [properly thus called] as being the first place of ingress<br>\
to the interior thereof. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تفاوهوا They talked [app. one to another: see<br>\
3]. (K.)<br>\
10<br>\
استفاه, (S, K,) inf. n. اِسْتِفَاهَةٌ and اِسْتِفَاهٌ,<br>\
(K,) the latter mentioned by Lh, (TA,) He (a<br>\
man, S) ate, (S, K,) or drank, (K,) vehemently,<br>\
after scantiness, (S, K,) or after weakness; (so in<br>\
a copy of the S;) but seldom used in relation to<br>\
drinking: or you say, استفاه فِى الطَّعَامِ, meaning<br>\
he ate much of the food: so says IAar, not particularizing the act as being after scarcity or not.<br>\
(TA.) [See also 2.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And He quenched his<br>\
thirst by drinking. (K.)<br>\
فَاهٌ: see what next follows: and see the next<br>\
paragraph again, in the latter half:<br>\
-A2-  and the<br>\
same word, and فَاهٍ, (the latter in two places,) see<br>\
voce فَاوُوهَةٌ.<br>\
فُوهٌ and ↓ فَاهٌ and ↓ فِيهٌ (K, TA) and, accord. to<br>\
the copies of the K, فُوهَةٌ, [or, as in the CK, فَوْهَة,]<br>\
but correctly ↓ فُوَّهَةٌ, (TA,) and فَمٌ, all signify the<br>\
same [i. e. The mouth]: (K, TA:) the pl. is أَفْوَاهٌ,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) pl. of فُوهٌ, (S, TA,) and as such its<br>\
case is plain; as pl. of فِيهٌ, it is like أَرْوَاحٌ as pl.<br>\
of رِيحٌ; as pl of فَاهٌ, it is allowable as having و<br>\
for its original medial radical; but as pl. of فُوَّهَةٌ,<br>\
it is anomalous: (TA:) and another pl. is أَفْمَامٌ,<br>\
(K, TA,) said by some to be pl. of فُمٌّ or فَمٌّ, with<br>\
teshdeed, of which an ex. occurs in a verse cited<br>\
in the first paragraph of art. فم; but some disallow this pl.; and accord. to some, (TA,) it has<br>\
no sing. (K, TA) agreeable with rule, (TA,) for<br>\
فَمٌ is originally فَوَهٌ, (K, TA,) with the و movent<br>\
by fet-h, or [فَوْهٌ, as in some copies of the S,] with<br>\
the و quiescent, on the authority of IJ; (TA;)<br>\
the ه is elided, and the و becomes a movent final,<br>\
therefore it must be changed into ا, because of<br>\
the fet-hah preceding it, so the word becomes فا;<br>\
but a noun may not be of two letters whereof one<br>\
is [the ن of] the tenween, (K, TA,) thus the passage is expressed in the M, but MF remarks that<br>\
correctly we should say whereof one is the ا, (TA,)<br>\
and therefore a hard letter is substituted for it,<br>\
one similar to it in kind, which is م, for they are<br>\
both labials, and in the م is a sort of humming<br>\
sound (هَوِىٌّ, in the CK هُوِىٌّ,) in the mouth, [or<br>\
rather in the nose,] resembling [the sound of] the<br>\
prolongation of the و: (K, TA:) [several similar<br>\
disquisitions, added in the TA, respecting the<br>\
change from فوه to فم, I omit, regarding them as<br>\
needless: what is said on this subject in the S,<br>\
in art. فم, I have mentioned in that art.:] in the<br>\
present art., J says that the م of فم is a substitute for the ه, not for the و, of فوه; but this is a<br>\
mistake: (IB, TA:) the dual of فَمٌ is فَمَانِ and<br>\
فَمَوَانِ (IAar, S, Msb, K) and فَمَيَانِ, the second<br>\
and third of which are anomalous: (IAar, K:)<br>\
of the second, which occurs in a verse of ElFarezdak, [and respecting which see the first<br>\
paragraph of art. فم,] Sb says that it is used by<br>\
poetic license. (TA.) In using it as a prefixed<br>\
noun, in the phrase هٰذَا فُوهُهُ, they deemed the<br>\
combination of the two هs difficult in respect of<br>\
utterance; therefore they suppressed the [radical]<br>\
ه thereof [in this case, and then in other, similar,<br>\
cases], and said, هٰذَا فُوهُ, and فُو زَيْدٍ, and رَأَيْتُ فَا<br>\
زَيْدٍ, and مَرَرْتُ بِفِى زَيْدٍ: and when prefixing it<br>\
to [the pronoun denoting] thyself, thou sayest,<br>\
هٰذَا فِىَّ; and this thou dost alike in using it in<br>\
the nom. case and in the accus. and in the gen.,<br>\
because the و [of فُو] is changed into ى and is<br>\
then incorporated [into the pronominal ى]: (S,<br>\
and the like is said in the Msb:) and sometimes,<br>\
though rarely, they did the like in other cases,<br>\
when not prefixing it; for instance, فَا occurs at<br>\
the end of a verse of El-&#39;Ajjáj, without an affix,<br>\
in this case for فَاهَا. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In the saying كَلَّمْتُهُ<br>\
فَاهُ إِلَى فِىَّ, meaning I spoke to him, his mouth<br>\
being near to my mouth, فاه is in the accus. case<br>\
as a denotative of state: (S, TA: *) or by reason<br>\
of the derivative [مُكَلِّمًا] meant to be understood:<br>\
or, as Sb says, it is an instance of one of the<br>\
nouns that are put in the place of inf. ns., and it<br>\
is not to be separated from what should follow it,<br>\
so that you may not say كَلَّمْتُهُ فَاهَ [alone], for<br>\
you tell of your nearness to the person, and that<br>\
there is not any one between you and him: and<br>\
if you will, you may use the nom. case, meaning<br>\
وَهٰذِهِ حَالُهُ [this being his state], (Sb, TA,) i. e.<br>\
فُوهُ إِلَى فِىَّ [his mouth was near to my mouth],<br>\
the clause [following كلّمته] occupying the place<br>\
of a denotative of state. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The saying<br>\
فَاهَا لِفِيكَ, (Meyd, K, TA,) which is a prov.,<br>\
(Meyd, TA,) means May God make the mouth of<br>\
misfortune to cleave to thy mouth; (Meyd, K, *<br>\
TA;) [but lit. signifies, only, her, or its, mouth<br>\
to thy mouth; and is [likewise] an instance of<br>\
one of the nouns that are used in the manner of<br>\
inf. ns. expressive of imprecation, by reason of a<br>\
verb not mentioned: Sb says, فاها is without tenween, meaning فَا الدَّاهِيَةِ, as is shown by the<br>\
saying,<br>\
وَدَاهِيَةٍ مِنْ دَوَاهِى المَنُو<br>\
نِ يَرْهَبُهَا النَّاسُ لَا فَا لَهَا<br>\
[Many a misfortune is there, of the misfortunes of<br>\
time, which men fear, that has no mouth, wherewith to bite]: (Sb, TA:) A&#39;Obeyd says that its<br>\
primary meaning is, may God make the ground<br>\
to be in thy mouth; that it is like the sayings<br>\
بِفِيكَ الحَجَرُ and بِفِيكَ الأَثْلَبُ; (S, Meyd;) and<br>\
[hence] it means disappointment [cleave] to thee:<br>\
(S, * Meyd:) a man of Belhujeym, (S, Meyd,)<br>\
cited by A&#39;Obeyd, (S,) addressing a wolf that<br>\
sought to get his she-camel, (Meyd,) says,<br>\
فَقُلْتُ لَهُ فَاهَا لِفِيكَ فَإِنَّهَا<br>\
قَلُوصُ امْرِئٍ قَارِيكَ مَا أَنْتَ حَاذِرُهُ<br>\
[And I said to him, فاها لفيك, for she is the<br>\
youthful she-camel of a man who will give thee as<br>\
a guest&#39;s entertainment that which thou fearest];<br>\
(S, Meyd; but in the S, as IB has observed,<br>\
فَإِنَّهُ is erroneously put for فَإِنَّهَا;) i. e. [who will<br>\
entertain thee with] the shooting of arrows;<br>\
(Meyd;) [by قَارِيكَ] he means يَقْرِيكَ, from قِرَى<br>\
الضَّيْفِ: (S:) it is also said that فَاهَا is metonymically used as meaning the dust of the earth,<br>\
which is termed the mouth of the earth because<br>\
it drinks the water; and it is as though the saying<br>\
meant the dust be in thy mouth: (Meyd:) Sh is<br>\
related to have said, I heard IAar say لِفِيكَ ↓ فَاهًا,<br>\
with tenween, meaning may God make thy mouth<br>\
to cleave to the ground; [or rather, ground to thy<br>\
mouth; lit., simply, a mouth to thy mouth;] and<br>\
some say فَاهَا لِفِيكَ, without tenween, as an imprecation meaning (assumed tropical:)  may God break thy فَم [i. e.<br>\
thy teeth, to which فَم is often metonymically applied, as is also فُوه]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  One says also,<br>\
سَقَى فُلَانٌ إِبِلَهُ عَلَى أَفْوَاهِهَا, meaning (tropical:)  Such a one<br>\
drew for his camels the water when they came to<br>\
it, while they were drinking; not having stored it<br>\
for them in the drinking-trough: and جَرَّ فُلَانٌ<br>\
إِبِلَهُ عَلَى أَفْوَاهِهَا (tropical:)  Such a one suffered his camels<br>\
to pasture while going along [by his driving them<br>\
gently: see art. جر]: so says As: and so accord.<br>\
to the A and other lexicons; but the author of the<br>\
K, by an omission, has assigned the latter explanation to the former phrase. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  لَوْ وَجَدْتُ<br>\
إِلَيْهِ فَا كَرِشٍ, meaning أَدْنَى طَرِيقٍ, (K, TA,) has<br>\
[with other, similar, phrases] been explained in<br>\
art. كرش [q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  فُو فَرَسٍ حَمِرٍ [Mouth<br>\
of a horse that is suffering indigestion in consequence of his having eaten barley and so made it<br>\
to stink] is an appellation applied to him who has<br>\
stinking breath. (TA. [An ex. of it occurs in a<br>\
verse of Imra-el-keys cited in the TA in art. حمر<br>\
as in Ahlwardt&#39;s “ Divans of the Six Ancient<br>\
Arabic Poets,” p. 125; and differently in De<br>\
Slane&#39;s “ Diwan d&#39;Amro-&#39;kaïs,” p. 36 of the Arabic<br>\
text.]) ―<br>\
-b7-  And فُو جُرَدٍ [Mouth of a large fieldrat] and فُو دَبًا [Mouth of a sort of small wingless<br>\
locust, or perhaps correctly فُو دَبَاةٍ mouth of a<br>\
small wingless locust,] are nicknames applied to a<br>\
little man. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  One says also, لَا فُضُّ فُوهُ,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  May his teeth, or front teeth, not be<br>\
broken. (K, * TA.) And سَقَطَ فُوهُ (assumed tropical:)  His teeth fell<br>\
out. (TA in art. فض [q. v.]) ―<br>\
-b9-  And مَاتَ لِفِيهِ<br>\
i. e. لِوَجْهِهِ [meaning (tropical:)  He died upon his face;<br>\
prone: like سَقَطَ لِوَجْهِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He fell upon his face:<br>\
the ل in both being used in the sense of عَلَى; as<br>\
it is in the phrase خَرُّوا لِأَذْقَانِهِمْ (expl. in art. خر),<br>\
&amp;c.]. (A, K, TA. [The explanation in the TK,<br>\
being somewhat ambiguous (though correct), has<br>\
misled Freytag in this case.]) And [in like<br>\
manner, using لِ in the sense of على,] كبَّهُ اللّٰهُ<br>\
لِفِيهِ, one of their forms of imprecation, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  May God cause him to die: or prostrate him<br>\
[upon his face; as also كَبَّهُ لِوَجْهِهِ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
[See also فُوَّهَةٌ as syn. with فُوهٌ; like which it has<br>\
أَفْوَاهٌ for a pl.]<br>\
-A2-  فُوهٌ also, having for its pl. أَفْوَاهٌ,<br>\
and pl. pl. أَفَاوِيهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) [which last<br>\
is of very frequent occurrence,] signifies Perfume,<br>\
or an odoriferous substance: (Mgh, Msb:) or a<br>\
thing, or substance, with which a perfume, or an<br>\
odoriferous substance, is compounded or prepared<br>\
(يُعَالَجُ); like as تَوَابِلُ signifies things, or substances, with which sorts of food are compounded<br>\
or prepared: (S, Mgh:) or the تَوَابِل [or seeds<br>\
used in cooking] with which food is compounded<br>\
or prepared (يُعَالَجُ) are also called أَفْوَاهُ الطِّيبِ:<br>\
(Msb:) [the pl. and pl. pl. are now generally applied to spices, or aromatics:] or الأَفْوَاهُ, the pl.<br>\
mentioned above, signifies [the seeds called] التَّوَابِلُ:<br>\
and also what diffuse fragrance [I read نَوَافِحُ, as<br>\
in my MS. copy of the K, pl. of نَافِحٌ, q. v.,<br>\
instead of نَوَافِجُ (with جِيم), the only reading<br>\
that I find in other copies of the K, regarding<br>\
the latter as indubitably a mistranscription,] of<br>\
perfumes, or odoriferous substances: (K:) and<br>\
the sorts, or species, of flowers; (K, TA;) thus<br>\
says AHn; and in one place he says that الافواح<br>\
signifies what are prepared for perfume, of sweetsmelling flowers; and sometimes they are of herbs,<br>\
or leguminous plants: (TA:) and also sorts, or<br>\
species, of a thing [app. of any kind]: (K:) and<br>\
one says, هُوَ مِنْ أَفْوَاهِ الطيب, and أَفْوَاهِ البُقُولِ,<br>\
meaning It is of the sorts, or species, and of the<br>\
mixtures, or compounds, of perfume, and of herbs,<br>\
or leguminous plants: (Mgh:) but فُوهٌ is not applied to anything that is termed عَقَّارٌ. (AHeyth,<br>\
TA in art. عقر.)<br>\
فَوَهٌ: see 1, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The quality<br>\
of a مَحَالَة [or large sheave of a pulley] such as is<br>\
termed فَوْهَآء, fem. of أَفْوَهُ, q. v. (TA.)<br>\
فِيهِ: see its syn. فُوهٌ.<br>\
فُوهَةٌ: see فُوَّهَةٌ, in five places.<br>\
فُوَّهٌ Certain slender, long, red roots, with which<br>\
one dyes; beneficial for the liver and the spleen<br>\
and the نَسَا [app. as meaning sciatica or the<br>\
sciatic nerve] and pain of the hip and of the flank,<br>\
powerfully diuretic, and kneaded with vinegar and<br>\
applied as a liniment it cures the [leprosy termed]<br>\
بَرَص: (K, TA:) but the word was not known<br>\
to Az in this sense, [which is the only meaning,<br>\
except one which I think doubtful, that I find<br>\
assigned to it;] and it is said to be the فُوَّة [which<br>\
see in art. فو, i. e. madder]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
فُوَّهَةٌ.<br>\
فَيِّهُ, originally فَيْوِهٌ: see مُفَوَّهٌ.<br>\
فُوَّهَةٌ: see its syn. فُوهٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence] it signifies<br>\
also (tropical:)  The فَم [i. e. mouth] of a place; likened to<br>\
the فَم [properly so called] as being the first place<br>\
of ingress, or entrance, to the interior: (TA:)<br>\
[and so too as being the place of egress, or exit,<br>\
from the interior:] it is of a river, or rivulet,<br>\
(Lth, S, Msb, TA,) and of a valley, or water-course, or torrent-bed, (K, TA,) and of a street,<br>\
and of a road; (S, Msb, K, TA;) signifying the<br>\
فَم [or mouth]; as also ↓ فُوهَةٌ, (K, TA,) without<br>\
teshdeed; mentioned by IAar: (TA:) or it signifies thus in relation to a river, or rivulet; (Lth,<br>\
Msb, TA;) the foremost part thereof: or, as<br>\
some say, the place of its pouring into the كِظَامَة<br>\
[q. v.]: and accord. to Lth, in relation to a<br>\
valley, or water-course, or torrent-bed, its رَأْس<br>\
[or head, as though in this case having one, or<br>\
each, of two contr. meanings, unless, as I believe<br>\
it to be, the mouth, or outlet, of a valley or water-course or torrent-bed be sometimes called its رأس<br>\
as being its foremost part]: (TA:) and of a<br>\
street, it is the place of egress, or exit; (Msb;)<br>\
the foremost part thereof: (TA:) and of a road,<br>\
it is the فَم [or mouth], which is the upper part<br>\
thereof (اعلاه): (Msb: [thus in my copy; but I<br>\
think that اعلاه is a mistranscription, in my copy,<br>\
for أَوَّلُهُ, and that the correct meaning is therefore<br>\
the foremost part thereof, agreeably with what is<br>\
said above in relation to a road and to a river or<br>\
rivulet:]) but accord. to some, ↓ فُوهَةٌ, without<br>\
teshdeed, is not allowable; and one should say,<br>\
الطَّرِيقِ قَعَدَ عَلَى فُوَّهَةٍ, and ↓ فُوَّهِهِ [probably, I<br>\
think, a mistranscription for فوهِهِ, with the و<br>\
quiescent, both meaning He sat at the mouth of<br>\
the road]; not ↓ فُوهَتِهِ, without teshdeed: (TA:)<br>\
and فُوَّهَةٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  the first, or foremost,<br>\
part, of a thing; (K, TA;) like that of the<br>\
street and that of the river or rivulet: [whence]<br>\
one says, طَلَعَ عَلَيْنَا فُوَّهَةُ إِبِلِكَ i. e. (tropical:)  The first, or<br>\
foremost, portion of thy camels [came to us, or<br>\
came forth upon us]; like the phrase فُوَّهَةُ الطَّرِيقِ:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. of فُوَّهَةٌ is أَفْوَاهٌ, (Ks, S, Msb, TA,)<br>\
which is anomalous, (S, Msb, TA,) and (TA)<br>\
فُوَّهَاتٌ [in the CK فُوْهاتٌ] and فَوَائِهُ. (K, TA.)<br>\
[Hence] one says, دَخَلُوا فِى أَفْوَاهِ البَلَدِ وَخَرَجُوا<br>\
مِنْ أَرْجُلِهِ, (A, K, * TA,) in the copies of the K<br>\
أَرْجُلِهَا, which is wrong, (TA,) i. e. (tropical:)  They entered<br>\
into the foremost parts of the country, or town,<br>\
and went forth from the hindermost parts thereof:<br>\
(A, K, TA:) the sing. of أَفْوَاه as here used is<br>\
فُوَّهَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  It signifies also A say, or saying, or speech; (S, K, TA;) from 1 in the first<br>\
of the senses assigned to it above: hence one says,<br>\
إِنَّ رَدَّ الفُوَّهَةِ لَشَدِيدٌ (S, TA) Verily the retracting<br>\
of that which has been said is difficult: (Har<br>\
p. 434:) and [hence] one says also, هُوَ يَخَافُ<br>\
فُوَّهَةَ النَّاسِ [He fears the say, or speech, of men].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The Muslims&#39; rending one another&#39;s<br>\
reputation by evil speech, or by backbiting; (K,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ فُوهَةً. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  إِنَّهُ لَذُو فُوَّهَةٍ<br>\
means Verily he is strong in speech, and free, or<br>\
unconstrained, in tongue. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And one says,<br>\
مَا أَشَدَّ فُوَّهَةَ بَعِيرِكَ فِى هٰذَا الكَلَأِ, meaning [How<br>\
vehement is] thy camel&#39;s eating [of this herbage]!<br>\
and in like manner, فُوَّهَةَ فَرَسِكَ [the vehement<br>\
eating of thy horse]: whence their saying أَفْوَاهُهَا<br>\
مَجَاسُّهَا [which may be well rendered as it has<br>\
been in art. جس, q. v.], meaning Their good eating shows thee their fatness, causing thee to be in<br>\
no need of feeling them to test their condition.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And Milk, as long as there remains in<br>\
it the taste of sweetness; (K, * TA;) as also ↓ فُوهَةٌ;<br>\
and sometimes correctly said with ق, i. e. [قُوهَةٌ,]<br>\
without teshdeed. (TA.)<br>\
فَاوُوهَةٌ A man who reveals, or discloses, everything that is in his mind; as also ↓ فَاهٍ, (Fr, S,<br>\
TA, [but omitted in one of my copies of the S,])<br>\
and ↓ فَاهٌ: (Fr, TA:) and بِجُوعِهِ ↓ فَاهٍ one who<br>\
reveals his hunger; originally فَائِهٌ, like as they<br>\
said هَارٍ and هَائِرٌ. (TA.)<br>\
أَفْوَهُ Having what is termed فَوَهٌ, meaning as<br>\
expl. in the last sentence of the first paragraph<br>\
[i. e. width of the mouth, &amp;c.]; fem. فَوْهَآءُ; (S,<br>\
K, TA;) the former applied to a man, and the<br>\
latter to a woman; (S, TA;) and in like manner<br>\
to horses. (TA.) فَوْهَآءُ شَوْهَآءُ, applied to a woman,<br>\
means Wide-mouthed, ugly: and, applied to a<br>\
mare, wide-mouthed, long-headed: or sharp in<br>\
spirit. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] بِئْرٌ فَوْهَآءُ A widemouthed well. (K.) ―<br>\
