فَدَاهُ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) aor. يَفْدِيهِ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. فِدَآءٌ (T, S, M, Mgh, K,) [omitted in my<br>\
copy of the Msb, probably by inadvertence,]) and<br>\
فَدًى, (Mgh,) or فِدًى, (so in the M, accord. to<br>\
the TT,) or also both of these, (Fr, T, S, Msb,<br>\
K,) the latter of them said by Fr, on one occasion, to be the more common, (T, TA,) [which<br>\
is the case when it is a subst., like فِدْيَةٌ,] but<br>\
&#39;Alee Ibn-Suleymán El-Akhfash [i. e. El-Akhfash<br>\
El-Asghar] is related to have said that this is not<br>\
allowable except by poetic license, and El-Kálee<br>\
says that الفِدَى was used by the Arabs in conjunction with الحِمَى, [see حِمَآءُ, in art. حمى,]<br>\
but other forms were used in other cases [among<br>\
which he seems to mention فَدَآء, with fet-h and<br>\
the lengthened alif, but the words in which I find<br>\
this expressed are somewhat ambiguous, and are<br>\
also rendered doubtful by an erasure and an<br>\
alteration]; (TA;) and ↓ افتداهُ, (M,) [whence<br>\
an ex. in a verse which will be found in what<br>\
follows,] or بِهِ ↓ افتدى (K, TA) and مِنْهُ, (TA,)<br>\
[but I do not know افتدى in either of these<br>\
phrases as having any other than the well-known<br>\
meaning of فَدَى نَفْسَهُ, which is strangely omitted<br>\
in the K;] and know ↓ فادِاهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. مُفَادَاةٌ and فِدَآءٌ; (Msb, TA;) but some<br>\
explain this differently [as will be shown in what<br>\
follows]; (T, Mgh, Msb, TA;) He gave his<br>\
ransom; (S;) he gave a thing, (K, TA, [اَعْطاهُ in<br>\
the CK being a mistake for أَعْطَى, without the<br>\
affixed pronoun,]) or a captive, for him, (TA,)<br>\
and so liberated him; (K, TA;) [i. e. he ransomed him;] or he liberated him, or ransomed<br>\
him, مِنَ الأَسْرِ [from captivity]: (Mgh, Msb:)<br>\
or ↓ فاداهُ signifies he loosed him, or set him free,<br>\
and took his ransom: (Mgh, Msb, TA:) or مُفَادَاةٌ<br>\
signifies the giving a man and taking a man [in<br>\
exchange]: and فِدَآءٌ, [as inf. n. of فَدَاهُ,] the purchasing him [from captivity or the like]: (Mbr,<br>\
T, Mgh, Msb, TA:) or the preserving a man<br>\
from misfortune by what one gives by way of<br>\
compensation for him; as also فَدًى: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA:) you say, فَدَيْتُهُ بِمَالِى I purchased [i. e. ransomed] him with my property, and بِنَفْسِى with<br>\
myself: (T:) or, accord. to Nuseyr Er-Rázee,<br>\
the Arabs say, الأَسِيرَ ↓ فَادَيْتُ [I ransomed the<br>\
captive], and فَدَيْتُهُ بِأَبِى وَ أُمِى [I ransomed him<br>\
in a tropical sense with my father and my mother],<br>\
and بِمَالٍ [with property], as though thou purchasedst him and freedst him therewith, when he<br>\
was not a captive; and you may say, فَدَيْتُ<br>\
الأَسيرَ meaning I freed the captive from the state<br>\
in which he was, though ↓ فَادَيْتُ is better in this<br>\
sense: as to the reading تَفْدُوهُمْ [in the Kur ii.<br>\
79], Aboo-Mo&#39;ádh says, it means Ye purchase<br>\
them from the enemy and liberate them; but the<br>\
reading ↓ تُفَادُوهُمْ, he says, means ye contend with<br>\
them who are in your hands respecting the price<br>\
and they so contend with you: (T, TA:) [that<br>\
↓ افتداهُ is syn. with فَدَاهُ is shown by what here<br>\
follows:] a poet says,<br>\
يُفْتَدَى لَفَدَيْتُهُ فَلَوْ كَانَ مَيتٌ<br>\
بِمَا لَمْ تَكُنْ عَنْهُ النُّفُوسُ تَطِيبُ<br>\
[And if a person dead were to be ransomed,<br>\
assuredly I would ransom him with what minds<br>\
would not be willing to relinquish]. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[The inf. ns. of the first of these verbs are much<br>\
used in precative phrases:] they said, فَدًى لَكَ<br>\
[for فَدَاكَ فَدًى, and therefore virtually meaning<br>\
فُدِيتَ Mayest thou be ransomed; the ل being<br>\
لِلتَّبْيِينِ i. e. “ for the purpose of notifying ” the<br>\
person addressed]: (TA:) and بِى أَ فَدًى لَكَ [for<br>\
فَدَاكَ أَبِى بِنَفْسِهِ فَدًى, and therefore virtually<br>\
meaning simply فَدَاكَ أَبِى بِنَفْسِهِ May my father<br>\
ransom thee with himself; so that it may be well<br>\
rendered may my father be a ransom for thee]:<br>\
(S:) and فِدَآء, with tenween, some of the Arabs<br>\
pronounce with kesr [to the ء, i. e. they pronounce<br>\
فِدَآء with the tenween of kesr], peculiarly when it<br>\
is next to [meaning immediately followed by] the<br>\
preposition ل, saying فِدَآءٍ لَكَ, because it is indeterminate; they intending thereby the meaning<br>\
of a prayer; and As has cited [as an ex. thereof]<br>\
the saying of En-Nábighah [Edh-Dhubyánee],<br>\
مَهْلًا فِدَآءٍ لَكَ الأَقْوَامُ كُلُّهُمُ<br>\
وَمَا أُثَمِرُ مِنْ مَالٍ وَمِنْ وَلَدِ<br>\
[Act gently: may the peoples, all of them, and<br>\
what I make to be abundant of wealth and of<br>\
offspring, give themselves as a ransom, or be a<br>\
ransom, for thee: فِدَآءٍ being app. assimilated to<br>\
an indeterminate imperative verbal noun such<br>\
as صَهٍ in the phrase صَهٍ يَا رَجُلُ, which is as<br>\
though one said اُسْكُتْ سُكُوتًا يَا رَجُلُ; thus meaning here لِيَفْدِكَ: but De Sacy mentions, in his<br>\
“ Chrest. Arabe,” see. ed., vol. ii., p. 460, three<br>\
allowable readings (not the foregoing reading) in<br>\
this verse, namely, فدآءٌ and فدآءً and فدآءٍ; and<br>\
adds that what here follows is said by a commentator to be, of several explanations, that which is<br>\
the right: والقول الآخر وهو الصحيح ان فدآءِ بمعنى<br>\
ليُفدِكَ فبناه كما بنى الامر وكذلك تَراكِ و دَراكِ لانه<br>\
بمعنى اترك و ادرك: this, it will be observed, is<br>\
similar to the explanation which I have offered<br>\
of فِدَآءٍ لك; for ليُفدِك is app. a typographical<br>\
mistake for ليَفدِك: and I incline to think that<br>\
فدآءِ, though supposed to be correct and therefore<br>\
likened to تَراكِ and دَراكِ, is a mistake of a copyist<br>\
for فدآءٍ; and the more so because I find in Ahlwardt&#39;s “ Divans of the Six Ancient Arabic<br>\
Poets ” the three readings فِداءٌ and فِداءً and فِداءٍ,<br>\
but not فِداءِ]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  وَفَدَيْنَاهُ بِذِبْحٍ [in the<br>\
Kur xxxvii. 107] means And we made an animal<br>\
prepared for sacrifice to be a ransom for him, and<br>\
freed him from slaughter. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  فَدَتْ<br>\
نَفْسَهَا مِنْ زَوْجِهَا and ↓ افتدت [alone] mean She<br>\
gave property to her husband so that she became<br>\
free from him by divorce. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  See<br>\
also what next follows.<br>\
2<br>\
فدّاهُ, (S, * K,) or فدّاهُ بِنَفْسِهِ, (S, * TA,) [or<br>\
both, for both are correct,] inf. n. تَفْدِيَةٌ; (S, K;)<br>\
and بنفسه ↓ فَدَاهُ, (S, TA, *) aor. يَفْدِيهِ, inf. n. فِدَآءٌ;<br>\
(TA;) He said to him ↓ فِدَاكَ جُعِلْتُ [May I be<br>\
made thy ransom, i. e. a ransom for thee]. (S,<br>\
K, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
فَاْدَىَ see 1, former half, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  In the<br>\
saying respecting bloodwits, وَإِنْ أَحَبُّوا فَادَوْا, the<br>\
meaning is, [And if they like,] they free the slayer,<br>\
or his next of kin who is answerable for him, and<br>\
accept the bloodwit; because this is a substitute<br>\
for the blood, like as the ransom is a substitute<br>\
for the captive. (Mgh.)<br>\
4<br>\
افداهُ الأَسِيرَ [in the CK (erroneously) الاسيرُ]<br>\
He accepted from him the ransom of the captive.<br>\
(M, K.) Hence the saying of the Prophet to<br>\
Kureysh, when &#39;Othmán Ibn-&#39;Abd-Allah and El-<br>\
Hakam Ibn-Keysán had been made captives, لَا<br>\
نُفْدِيكُمُو هُمَا حتَّى يَقْدَمَ صَاحِبَانَا [We will not accept<br>\
from you the ransom of them two until our two<br>\
companions shall come], meaning [by the two<br>\
companions] Saad Ibn-Abee-Wakkás and &#39;Otbeh<br>\
Ibn-Ghazwán. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  افدى فُلَانٌ Such a one<br>\
danced, or dandled, his child: (K, TA:) because<br>\
of his [often] saying, فَدِى لَكَ أَبِى وَ أُمِى [May my<br>\
father and my mother be ransoms for thee].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  افدى also signifies He made for his<br>\
dried dates a store-chamber. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
became large in his body; (IAar, T, K, TA;) as<br>\
though it became like the فَدَآء [q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And He sold dates. (IAar, T, K.)<br>\
6<br>\
تفادوا They ransomed one another. (S, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And (assumed tropical:)  They guarded themselves, one by another;<br>\
as though every one of them made his fellow to<br>\
be his ransom. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And تفادى مِنْهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  He guarded against it, or was cautious of it,<br>\
and kept aloof from it. (S, K, * TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِفْتَدَىَ see 1, first quarter, in two places; and<br>\
again, near the middle of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  As<br>\
intrans., افتدى signifies [He ransomed himself;]<br>\
he gave a ransom for himself. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
You say, افتدى مِنْهُ بِكَذَا [He ransomed himself<br>\
from him with such a thing]. (S.) Hence the<br>\
usage of the verb in the Kur ii. 229. (TA.) See<br>\
1, last sentence but one.<br>\
فَدًى and ↓ فِدًى and ↓ فِدَآءٌ and ↓ فِدْيَةٌ all signify the same, (S, K,) i. e. [A ransom;] a thing,<br>\
(K, TA,) or a captive, (TA,) that is given for a<br>\
man, who is therewith liberated: (K, TA:) [the<br>\
first three are also inf. ns. (and have been mentioned as such in the first paragraph); therefore<br>\
when you say فَدًى لَكَ أَبِى and فِدًى لك ابى, the<br>\
words فَدًى and فِدًى may be either inf. ns. or<br>\
substs.: as substs., the second and third are more<br>\
common than the first:] فِدْيَةً [is also sometimes<br>\
expl. as an inf. n., but accord. to general usage]<br>\
signifies as above; (K, TA;) or property given<br>\
as a substitute [or a ransom] for a captive: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA:) and property by the giving of which<br>\
one preserves himself from evil in the case of a<br>\
religious act in which he has fallen short of what<br>\
was incumbent, like the expiation for the breaking<br>\
of an oath and of a fast; and thus it is used in<br>\
the Kur ii. 180 and 192: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and<br>\
its pl. is فِدًى and فِدَيَاتٌ. (Mgh, Msb, TA.)<br>\
فِدًى: see the next preceding paragraph. [Hence<br>\
the phrase] جُعِلْتُ فِدَاكَ: see 2. It is also a pl.<br>\
of its syn. فِدْيَةً. (Mgh, Msb, TA.)<br>\
فِدْيَةٌ: see فَدًى.<br>\
-A2-  خُذْ عَلَى هِدْيَتِكَ وَ فِدْيَتِكَ,<br>\
accord. to the K, but in the S, خُذْ فِى هِدْيَتِكَ<br>\
وَقِدْيَتِكَ, mentioned in art. قدى, is a saying<br>\
meaning [Take thou to] that [course] in which<br>\
thou wast: the author of the K seems to have<br>\
followed Sgh, who has mentioned it here: (TA<br>\
in the present art.:) فِدْيَهٌ and قِدْيَهٌ are dial. vars.<br>\
(TA in art. قدى.)<br>\
فَدَآءٌ An أَنْبَار, (K, TA,) i. e. (TA) a collection,<br>\
of wheat: (M, K, * TA:) or it signifies, (K,) or<br>\
signifies also, (M,) a collection of food, consisting<br>\
of barley and dates and the like: (M, K:) or an<br>\
أَنْبَار, i. e. a collection, of food, consisting of wheat<br>\
and dates and barley: (S:) and it is said to signify a place in which dates are spread and dried,<br>\
in the dial. of &#39;Abd-El-Keys. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The<br>\
حَجْم [or protuberant, or prominent, part, or<br>\
perhaps the bulk,] of a thing (M, K) of any<br>\
kind. (M.)<br>\
فِدَآئٌ: see فَدًى.<br>\
الفِدَاوِيَّةُ is the appellation of A class, or rect,<br>\
of the خَوَارِج of the دُرْزِيَّة [or دُرُوز, whom we call<br>\
the Druses; it is a coll. gen. n., of which the<br>\
n. un. is فِدَاوِىُّ; the و being a substitute for ء:<br>\
it is used to signify those who undertake perilous<br>\
adventures, more particularly for the destruction<br>\
of enemies of their party; as though they offered<br>\
themselves as ransoms or victims; and hence it is<br>\
applied to the sect called in our histories of the<br>\
Crusades “ The Assassins ”]. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
مَفْدِىٌّ, originally مَفْدُوىٌ. In the saying بِنَفْسِى<br>\
فُلَانٌ مُفْدِىٌّ With my soul, or myself, may such a<br>\
one be ransomed, مَفْدِىٌّ is often suppressed; being<br>\
meant to be understood.]<br>\
