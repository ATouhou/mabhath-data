فَجِلَ, aor.<br>\
فَجَلَ, inf. n. فَجَلٌ; (Msb, K;) and<br>\
فَجُلَ, (O,) or فَجَلَ, (K,) aor.<br>\
فَجُلَ, (O, K,) inf. n.<br>\
فَجْلٌ; (K;) He, or it, was, or became, thick, and<br>\
soft, or flaccid: (O, Msb, K:) so says Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád. (O.)<br>\
2<br>\
فجّلهُ, inf. n. تَفْجِيلٌ, He made it broad, or<br>\
wide. (K.)<br>\
8<br>\
افتجل أَمْرًا, (K,) or أَمْرَهُ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O,)<br>\
He forged [a case or matter &amp;c., or his case &amp;c.];<br>\
syn. اِخْتَلَقَهُ; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K;) and invented<br>\
it, or excogitated it; syn. اِخْتَرَعَهُ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.)<br>\
فُجْلٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ فُجُلٌ, (O, K,) both mentioned by AHn, (O, TA,) or ↓ فِجْلٌ, (Msb,) thus,<br>\
with kesr, commonly pronounced by the vulgar,<br>\
(TA,) [The radish, raphanus sativus; (Forskål&#39;s<br>\
Flora Ægypt. Arab., lxix. no. 327; and Delile&#39;s<br>\
Floræ Ægypt. Illustr., no. 608;)] a certain أَرُومَة<br>\
[or root of the kind termed rhizoma], (K, TA,)<br>\
that occasions abominable eructation; (TA;) a<br>\
herb, (Msb,) well known: (S, Msb:) said by IDrd<br>\
to be not a genuine Arabic word; and thought by<br>\
him to be derived from فَجِلَ signifying as expl.<br>\
above: (Msb:) n. un. with ة, (K,) i. e. فُجْلَةٌ (S,<br>\
O) and فُجُلَةٌ (O) [and فِجْلَةٌ]: it is a gardenplant, found in abundance; and there is a Syrian<br>\
sort, said to be produced by putting together the<br>\
seeds of the colza and [those of] the فجل: (TA:)<br>\
it (i. e. each sort, TA) is good for pain of the<br>\
joints, and jaundice, (K, TA,) and sciatica, and<br>\
the نِقْرِس [i. e. gout, or specially in the foot or<br>\
feet], (TA,) and pain of the liver (K, TA) arising<br>\
from cold, (TA,) and the biting and stinging of<br>\
vipers and scorpions: (K, TA: [several other supposed properties thereof mentioned in the K, and<br>\
many more mentioned in the TA, I omit as unimportant:]) what is most potent thereof is its<br>\
seed; then, its peel; then, its leaf; then, its flesh.<br>\
(K, TA.) What is called حَبُّ الفُجْلِ is Another<br>\
remedial thing: (K:) this فجل is not of the species<br>\
of herb mentioned above: (O, Msb, TA:) so says<br>\
AHn: the hakeem Dáwood says, it is one of the<br>\
species of this فجل, a wild species, elongated,<br>\
abounding in the Sa&#39;eed of Egypt: (TA:) [it is<br>\
the raphanus oleifer, mentioned by Delile (Floræ<br>\
Ægypt. Illustr., no. 609,) as cultivated in Nubia<br>\
and in Egypt, and called in Arabic “ symâgah: ”]<br>\
from it (or from its seed, TA) is made the oil of<br>\
the فجل (دُهْنُ الفُِجْلِ); (Msb, K, TA;) and it is<br>\
known by the appellation of السَّيْمَعَةُ [correctly<br>\
السَّيْمَغَةُ]. (TA.) [Delile, ubi suprà, no. 571,<br>\
mentions فِجْل الجَمَل, as a name of The cakile<br>\
maritima of Tournefort; the bunias cakile of<br>\
Linn.: and in the same, no. 396, he mentions<br>\
فِجْل الجَبَل as the Arabic name of The rumex<br>\
spinosus of Linn.; as does also Forskål, in his<br>\
work cited above, p. lxv., no. 213, and again in<br>\
p. 76.]<br>\
