فَاظَ, aor. يَفِيظُ, inf. n. فَيْظٌ (ISk, T, S, M, K)<br>\
and فُيُوظٌ and فَيَظَانٌ (S, M, K) and فَيْظَانٌ (Lh,<br>\
TA) and فَيْظُوظَةٌ, (Lth, M, K,) He (a man, S)<br>\
died; (ISk, T, S, M, K;) as also, (sometimes, S)<br>\
↓ فَاظَ, aor. يَفُوظُ, inf. n. فَوْظٌ (ISk, T, S, M, K) and<br>\
فَوَاظٌ; (S, K, TA; but in the CK, فُوَاظٌ, and<br>\
there said to be with damm;) or, accord. to IJ,<br>\
only the inf. n., فَوْظٌ, of the latter verb is used,<br>\
though the verb itself is allowable on the ground<br>\
of analogy. (M.) You say also, حَانَ فَيْظُهُ and<br>\
↓ فَوْظُهُ, [in the CK فُوْظُهُ,] The time came for his<br>\
dying. (M, K.) In like manner, (S,) you say<br>\
also, فَاظَتْ نَفْسُهُ His soul departed, or went forth;<br>\
Lth, T, S, M;) on the authority of AO and Ks;<br>\
and the like is related on the authority of AZ;<br>\
(S;) aor. تَفِيظُ, (M,) inf. n. فَيْظٌ (Lth, T, M) and<br>\
فَيْظُوظَةٌ; (Lth, T;) and [accord. to some,] فَاظَتْ<br>\
نَفْسُهُ, inf. n. فَوْظٌ: (M:) or, when the نفس is<br>\
mentioned, you say, فَاضَتْ, with ض: (K:) As<br>\
says, I heard Aboo-&#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;Alà say that one<br>\
should not say فَاظَتْ نَفْسُهُ, (T, * S, M, *) but فاظ,<br>\
(S, M,) meaning “ he died; ” and not فَاضَ, with<br>\
ض, decidedly; (S;) or not فَاضَتْ: (T:) [but<br>\
what was said by As respecting these two verbs<br>\
has been stated more fully, and variously, in art.<br>\
فيض, q. v.:] AO says that فاظت نَفْسُهُ is of the<br>\
dial. of Keys; and فاضت, of the dial. of Temeem:<br>\
Fr says that the people of El-Hijáz and Teiyi say<br>\
the former; and Kudá&#39;ah and Temeem and Keys<br>\
say the latter: AHát says, I heard AZ say that<br>\
Benoo-Dabbeh alone say the latter; and ElMázinee relates the like on the authority of AZ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also, فَاظَ نَفْسَهُ, (Ks, S, M, K,)<br>\
aor. يَفِيظُ, (Ks, T,) He vomited forth his soul:<br>\
(Ks, S, M, K:) the verb being trans. as well as<br>\
intrans. (Ks, S.)<br>\
4<br>\
افاظهُ He (God) caused him to die. (K, TA.)<br>\
And you say also, ضَرَبْتُهُ حَتَّى أَفَظْتُ نَفْسَهُ [I beat<br>\
him, or smote him, until I made his soul to depart,<br>\
or go forth]. (S.) And لَأُفِيظَنَّ نَفْسَكَ [I will assuredly cause thy soul to depart, or go forth]<br>\
(M.) And افاظهُ اللّٰهُ نَفْسَهُ [God caused him to<br>\
vomit forth his soul]. (Ks, T, S, M.)<br>\
تفيّظوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ They constrained themselves to<br>\
vomit forth their souls. (S, TA.) [But in one<br>\
copy of the S, I find يُفِيظُوا أَنْفُسَهُمْ, expl. as<br>\
meaning They cause to vomit forth their souls;<br>\
which suggests that the right reading may perhaps<br>\
be يُفِيظُوا: or it may be يَفِيظُوا, from فَاظَ نَفْسَهُ.]<br>\
