T,) or shot, or shot at, and hit, or smote, him,<br>\
namely a gazelle, (A,) or an animal of the chase,<br>\
(AZ, T,) in his فُؤَاد. (AZ, T, A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, said<br>\
of a disease, (S,) and of fear, (A,) It smote, or<br>\
affected, his فُؤَاد: (S, A:) or, said of fear, it<br>\

(M, L) the cake of bread, or lump of dough, [or<br>\

above, (L,) He made for the cake of bread, or<br>\

تفأّد i. q. تَوَقَّدَ [i. e., when said of fuel, It<br>\
burned, burned up, burned brightly or fiercely,<br>\
blazed, or flamed]: (M, L, K:) [and] so when said<br>\
of the heart [i. e. It became excited with ardour,<br>\
or eagerness]. (M, L, K. *) And i. q. تَحَرَّقَ [It<br>\
burned much, as a quasi-pass. v.]: (so in copies<br>\
of the K, in SM&#39;s copy and in my MS. copy and<br>\

فَأْدٌ: [see 1, of which it is the inf. n.: and] see<br>\
the paragraph here following.<br>\
فُؤَادٌ (S, M, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and فَوَادٌ, which<br>\
is strange, (K,) but said by Esh-Shiháb to be a<br>\
dial var., and to be without reason disallowed by<br>\
AHát; (TA;) of the masc. gender only; (Lh,<br>\
M, L, K, &amp;c.;) The heart; syn. قَلْبٌ [q. v.];<br>\
(S, M, A, L, Msb, K, &amp;c.;) of man, and of<br>\
an animal other than man: (M, L:) so called<br>\
because of its تَفَأُّد (T, M, L, K) i. e. تَوَقُّد [or<br>\
ardour]; (M, L, K;) or because of its pulsation,<br>\
and commotion; [for which reason also the heart<br>\
is said to be called القَلْبُ, from التَّقَلُّبُ;] for it<br>\
is said that the primary meaning of ↓ فَأْدٌ is<br>\
“ motion,” and the “ putting in motion: ” (MF,<br>\
TA:) or the heart is thus called only when its<br>\
تَفَأُّد, i. e. its تَوَقُّد, is regarded: and most authors<br>\
make a distinction between فُؤَاد and قَلْبٌ; the<br>\
latter of which is said to have a more special<br>\
signification than the former: (TA:) and the<br>\
former is said to be [the pericardium,] the غِشَآء,<br>\
(L, TA,) or the وِعَآء, (TA,) of the قَلْب: (L,<br>\
TA:) or the middle thereof: (L:) or the interior thereof: (TA:) the قَلْب being its حَبَّة<br>\
[q. v.], (L, TA,) or its سُوَيْدَآء: (L:) or فُؤَادٌ<br>\
signifies the appendages of the مَرِىْء [or œsophagus], consisting of the liver and lungs and<br>\
قَلْب [or heart]: (K:) pl. أَفْئِدَةٌ, (S, M, A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K, &amp;c.,) the only pl. thereof known to Sb.<br>\
(M, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The mind, or intellect: and this,<br>\
it is said, may be the meaning of the phrase [in<br>\
the Kur liii. 11], مَا كَذَبَ الْفُؤَادُ مَا رَأَى, (TA,) or<br>\
ما كَذَّبَ, another reading, i. e. [The mind] did not<br>\
disacknowledge, or deem improbable, what he saw.<br>\
(Jel.) [Hence,] حِدَّةُ الفُؤَادِ i. q. ذَكَآءٌ [meaning<br>\
Sharpness, or acuteness, of mind, in a man: and<br>\
sharpness of spirit in a beast]. (S in art. ذكو.)<br>\
[And حَدِيدُ الفُؤَادِ i. q. ذَكِئٌّ meaning Sharp, or<br>\
acute, in mind, applied to a man: and sharp in<br>\
spirit, applied to a beast:] one says فَرَسٌ حَدِيدَةُ<br>\
الفُؤَادِ [A mare sharp in spirit]; and in like<br>\
manner نَاقَةٌ [a she-camel]: (S and K in art.<br>\
روع:) and نَاقَةٌ رُوَاعَةُ الفُؤَادِ, and رُوَاعُ الفُؤَادِ, a<br>\
quick, spirited, vigorous, she-camel; sharp in<br>\
spirit; syn. شَهْمَةٌ ذَكِيَّةٌ. (K in that art.) [And<br>\
طَارَ فُؤَادُهُ His mind or intellect, fled: and his<br>\
courage. (See شَعَاعٌ: and طَارَ.)]<br>\

(M, L, K,) on the fire: (T:) or roasted upon live<br>\
coals; as also ↓ مُفْأَدٌ [evidently, I think, a mistranscription for ↓ مُفْتَأَدٌ]. (L.) ―<br>\

(T, L, K.)<br>\
