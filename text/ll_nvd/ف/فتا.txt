مَا فَتِئَ, (Fr, * T, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
فَتَاَ, (Fr, T,<br>\
Msb;) and ما فَتَأَ, [aor.<br>\
فَتَاَ;] (K;) and ما فَتُؤَ,<br>\
(Fr, * T, K,) aor.<br>\
فَتُاَ; (Fr, T;) He did not cease<br>\
[doing a thing; being incomplete, or non-attributive, verbs]; (T, Msb, K;) as also ↓ مَا أَفْتَأَ;<br>\
(AZ, T, K;) this last of the dial. of Temeem;<br>\
(AZ, T, M;) the first of the dial. of Keys and<br>\
others: (AZ, T:) you say مَا فَتِئْتُ أَذْكُرُهُ, (AZ,<br>\
T, S, O, Msb, *) or مَا فَتِئْتُ أَفْعَلُ, (M,) and ما<br>\
فَتَأْتُ, (AZ, T, S, O, M,) aor.<br>\
فَتَاَ, inf. n. فَتْءٌ (AZ,<br>\
T, M) and فُتُوْءٌ; (M;) and ما فَتُؤْتُ, aor.<br>\
فَتُاَ; (Fr,<br>\
O;) and ↓ ما أَفْتَأْتُ; (AZ, T, S, M, O;) I did<br>\
not cease [remembering him, or doing such a<br>\
thing]: (AZ, T, S, M, O, Msb: *) these verbs<br>\
are used only in negative phrases, in this sense;<br>\
but sometimes the particle of negation is suppressed, it being, however, meant to be understood; (T, S, M;) as in تَاللّٰهِ تَفْتَأُ تَذْكُرُ يُوسُفَ,<br>\
(T, S, O, K,) in the Kur [xii. 85], (T, S, O,)<br>\
meaning مَا تَفْتَأُ, (S, O, K,) thus in all the copies<br>\
of the K [and in the S and O], but correctly لَا<br>\
تَفْتَأُ, [i. e. By God, thou wilt not cease remembering Joseph,] accord. to all the grammarians and<br>\
the expositors of the Kur-án: (TA:) for the oath<br>\
that is not accompanied by the sign of affirmation<br>\
denotes negation. (Bd in xii. 85.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فَتِئَ<br>\
عَنْهُ, (O, K,) inf. n. فَتْءٌ, (O,) He forgot it, and<br>\
abstained, or desisted, from it; (نَسِيَهُ وَانْقَدَعَ عَنْهُ,<br>\
O, and so in some copies of the K; in other<br>\
copies of the K انقذع or انفذغ; [both of which<br>\
are evidently mistranscriptions;]) namely, an<br>\
affair, or event: (O, TA:) or this is used only<br>\
in negative phrases. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  فَتَأَ, as a complete<br>\
[i. e. an attributive] verb, signifies He stilled,<br>\
quieted, or made to cease, syn. سَكَّنَ, or, as some<br>\
say, (TA,) he abated, or allayed, syn. كَسَرَ, and<br>\
extinguished: thus says Ibn-Málik, as on the<br>\
authority of Fr; and it is correct: AHei has<br>\
erred in charging him with having committed a<br>\
mistake: (K, TA:) for he says that it is a mistranscription for فَثَأَ, with the three-pointed ث:<br>\
it is mentioned also by IKoot and IKtt: and<br>\
Fr states that one says, فَتَأْتُهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ meaning<br>\
I made him to cease (سَكَّنْتُهُ) from the affair: and<br>\
فَتَأْتُ النَّارَ meaning I extinguished the fire. (TA.)<br>\
