-b3-  فُلَانٌ لَا يُفْتَرَطُ إِحْسَانُهُ وَبِرُّهُ (S, K *) Such<br>\
a one&#39;s beneficence and kindness are not caught at,<br>\
(لَا يُفْتَرَصُ, as in a copy of the S and in the TA,)<br>\
or do not pass away, (لَا يَنْقَرِضُ, as in another<br>\
copy of the S,) and (S, TA) their passing away,<br>\
so that one cannot avail himself of them, is not to<br>\
be feared: (S, K, TA:) a saying of one of the<br>\
Arabs of the desert. (TA.)<br>\
فَرْطٌ Excess; extravagance; exorbitance; an<br>\
exceeding degree; an exceeding of the due bounds,<br>\
or just limits. (S, O, K, * TA.) You say, إِيَّاكَ<br>\

excess in the affair]. (S, O.) ―<br>\

same, (S, O,) nor less than three. (K.) You say,<br>\
أَنَا أَلْقَاهُ فِى الفَرْطِ [I meet him, or will meet him,<br>\
or shall meet him, after some days]. (TA.) [But<br>\
the above-mentioned restriction does not apply<br>\
when it is prefixed to a noun signifying a period<br>\

[app. meaning I came to him after a day or two<br>\
days]. (S, O.) [It is said in the TA that, accord.<br>\
to ISk, it is used in the saying آتِيكَ فَرْطَ يَوْمٍ أَوْ<br>\
يَوْمَيْنِ, and that it is a day between two days;<br>\
but this seems to me to be a mistake for between<br>\
a day and two days: it is afterwards said in the<br>\
TA that فَرْطَ يَوْمٍ أَوْ يَوْمَيْنِ means after two days;<br>\
but the complete explanation should doubtless be<br>\
after a day or two days.] Lebeed says,<br>\
هَلِ النَّفْسُ إِلَّا مُتْعَةٌ مُسْتَعَارَةٌ<br>\
تُعَارُ فَتَأْتِى رَبَّهَا فَرْطَ أَشْهُرِ<br>\
[Is the soul aught but a borrowed thing to be<br>\
enjoyed, which is lent, and goes to its Lord after<br>\
some months?]. (S.) And an Arab said, مَضَيْتُ<br>\
فَرْطَ سَاعَةٍ وَلَمْ أُومِنْ أَنْ أَنْفَلِتَ; and being asked<br>\
“ What is فرط ساعة? ” he answered, “Like since<br>\
thou begannest to speak: ” he meant [I went away<br>\
after a little while, or a little while ago, and] by<br>\
لم and what follows it, I did not feel sure of my<br>\
escaping. (TA.)<br>\

in the O,) An erect way-mark, or thing set up for<br>\
guidance to the right way: (O, K:) pl. أَفْرُطٌ and<br>\
أَفْرَاطٌ: (K:) [but] it is said in the A that بَدَتْ<br>\
لَنَا أَفْرَاطُ المَفَازَةِ is a tropical saying, signifying مَا<br>\
اسْتَقْدَمَ مِنْ أَعْلَامِهَا [as though meaning (tropical:)  The foremost of the way-marks of the desert, or waterless<br>\
desert, appeared to us]. (TA.)<br>\

in the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ, (S, Msb, TA,)<br>\
like تَبَعٌ in the sense of تَابِعٌ: (S, TA:) and a<br>\
number of persons who perform that office; (S,<br>\
O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ فُرَّاطٌ, (S, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
pl. of فَارِطٌ: (Msb, TA:) you say رَجُلٌ فَرَطٌ and<br>\
قَوْمٌ فَرَطٌ. (S, Msb.) It is said in a trad., أَنَا<br>\
فَرَطُكُمْ عَلَى الحَوْضِ [I shall be your preceder to<br>\
the pool of Paradise]. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also فَارِطٌ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  A child [that dies] not having<br>\
attained to puberty: (K, TA:) [whence the<br>\
phrase اِفْتَرَطَ فَرَطًا: see 4:] pl. أَفْرَاطٌ: or فَرَطٌ is<br>\
both sing. and pl. [in this sense]. (TA.) ―<br>\

Hence also, (S, Msb,) (tropical:)  A reward, or recompense,<br>\
prepared in advance, or beforehand: (S, Mgh,<br>\

the due bounds, or just limits, are exceeded: (S,<br>\
O:) or in which obedience is neglected and unheeded: (TA:) or [one of] preference of backwardness (تَقْدِيمُ العَجْزِ): (Zj:) or [one of]<br>\

done,] signifies hastiness, or forwardness, and<br>\
transgression, in religion. (TA.)<br>\
فُرْطَةٌ The act of going forth; (S, O, K; *) and<br>\

الفُرْطَةِ فِى البِلَادِ [He (referring to Mohammad)<br>\
forbade thee from going forth into the country,<br>\
or provinces]. (S, O.) And فُلَانٌ ذُو فُرْطَةٍ فِى<br>\
البِلَادِ Such a one is a person who makes many<br>\
journeys. (TA.)<br>\
فَرَطِىٌّ and فُرَطِىٌّ, (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K,) but the latter<br>\
is said in the Moheet to be with damm, [which<br>\
most probably means that it is فُرْطِىٌّ, and it is<br>\
thus written in the O,] (TA,) applied to a camel<br>\
and to a man, Untractable, refractory, or stubborn;<br>\
(Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K;) not rendered manageable or submissive. (TA.)<br>\

who first arrives at it; (S, O;) water that is<br>\
common property among a number of tribes, and<br>\

in like manner the latter word applied to a well.<br>\
(TA.) You say, بَيْنَ بَنِى فُلَانٍ ↓ هٰذَا مآءٌ فُرَاطَةٌ<br>\
وَبَنِى فُلَانٍ, meaning, [This is water between the<br>\
sons of such a one and the sons of such a one, so<br>\
that] whichever of them arrives at it first waters<br>\

فُِرَاطَةٌ: see فِرَاطٌ, in three places.<br>\
فَارِطٌ Preceding; going before; being, or becoming, before, beforehand, first, or foremost;<br>\
having, or getting, priority, or precedence: pl.<br>\
فُرَّاطٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\

first sentence. ―<br>\
-b3-  فُرَّاطُ القَطَا The foremost of the<br>\
[birds called] قطا [meaning sand-grouse], who precede the others to the valley and the water. (S,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  فَارِطٌ also signifies One who goes before<br>\
to dig the grave: pl. as above, and also فَوَارِطُ,<br>\
which latter is extr., like فَوَارِسُ, pl. of فَارِسٌ, as<br>\
is said in the O. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And hence, (Lth,<br>\
TA,) الفَارِطَانِ, (Lth, S, O, K,) in the A ↓ الفَرَطَانِ,<br>\
(TA,) (tropical:)  Two stars, (Lth, S, O, K,) separate, each<br>\
from the other, (Lth, S, O,) before [the stars in<br>\
the tail of the Bear, app. meaning the Greater<br>\
Bear, called] بَنَات نَعْش, (K,) or before the bier<br>\
(سَرِير) of بنات نعش: [each] being likened to the<br>\
فارط who goes before a company of men to dig<br>\
the grave. (Lth, O, TA.)<br>\
مُفْرَطٌ Sent before, or first, or foremost. (TA.)<br>\
Hence the saying in the Kur [xvi. 64], (TA,)<br>\
وَأَنَّهُمْ مُفْرَطُونَ And that they shall be sent before,<br>\
or first, or foremost, to the fire [of Hell], and<br>\
hastened thither; (Az, O, K, TA;) this being<br>\
the primary signification: (Az, O, TA:) or forgotten (Mujáhid, Fr, O) in the fire [of Hell]:<br>\
(Fr:) or neglected, or left: (TA:) or forgotten,<br>\
and neglected or left, in the fire: and another<br>\
reading is ↓ مُفْرِطُونَ, meaning [they are] exceeding<br>\
the limits assigned to them: (O, K:) and another<br>\
is ↓ مُفَرِّطُونَ, meaning [falling short of their duty]<br>\
to themselves, in respect of sins. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Filled,<br>\
or] full; applied to a pool of water left by a<br>\
torrent. (S, TA.)<br>\
مُفْرِطٌ Exceeding the due bounds, or just limits;<br>\
acting extravagantly; applied to a man: excessive; applied to anything; as, for instance, tallness, and shortness. (TA.) It is said in a trad.<br>\
of &#39;Alee, ↓ لَا تَرَى الجَاهِلَ إَلَّا مُفْرِطًا أَوْ مُفَرِّطًا Thou<br>\
wilt not see the ignorant otherwise than exceeding<br>\
the due bounds in what he doth or falling short of<br>\
what he ought therein. (TA.) See also مُفْرَطٌ.<br>\
مُفَرِّطٌ: see مُفْرَطٌ and مُفْرِطٌ.<br>\
مَفَارِطٌ The extremities of a country or the like.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
