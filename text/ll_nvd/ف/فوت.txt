فَاتَ الأَمْرُ, aor. يَفُوتُ, inf. n. فَوْتٌ and فَوَاتٌ,<br>\
originally signifies فَاتَ وَقْتُ فِعْلِهِ [i. e. The time,<br>\
or opportunity, of the doing, or performing, of the<br>\
affair passed, passed away, elapsed, or escaped,<br>\
neglected by him, without his doing it or performing it]; and hence the phrase فَاتَتِ الصَّلَاةُ, meaning The time of prayer passed, passed away,<br>\
elapsed, or escaped, without his performing it<br>\
therein (Msb:) and ↓ افتات is syn. with فَاتَ.<br>\
(M, O.) [And both of these verbs are trans.:]<br>\
one says فَاتَهُ الشَّىْءُ, (S, O, Msb,) or الأَمْرُ, (M,<br>\
K,) aor. as above, (O,) and so the inf. ns.; (S, *<br>\
M, O, * Msb, K;) and ↓ افتاتهُ: (K;) The thing,<br>\
(??) affair, passed, or passed away, from him<br>\
[neglected by him]; (M, K;) [or the time, or<br>\
opportunity, of the doing, or performing, thereof<br>\
passed, or passed away from him neglected by<br>\
him;] or the thing escaped him, [or became<br>\
beyond his reach,] so that he was unable to attain<br>\
it, or to do it, or to accomplish it. (Msb.) But<br>\
this explanation is not applicable except in the<br>\
case of prayer, and the like: in other cases, فَاتَهُ<br>\
signifies He, or it, preceded him; was, or became,<br>\
or got, before him; outwent him; passed beyond<br>\
him; or had, got, or look, precedence of him:<br>\
and went, or passed, away from him: and the<br>\
like. (MF, TA.) One says, فَاتَنِى كَذَا, meaning سَبَقَنِى [i. e. Such a thing preceded me, &amp;c.,<br>\
app. so as to become beyond my reach]: and فُتُّهُ<br>\
أَنَا [I preceded it, &amp;c.]: (T:) and جَارَيْتُهُ حَتَّى<br>\
فُتُّهُ I ran with him until I passed beyond him, or<br>\
outwent him: (A, TA:) and فَاتَهُ فُلَانٌ بِذِرَاعٍ<br>\
Such a one preceded him, or outwent him, by a<br>\
cubit. (Msb.) فَلَا فَوْتَ, in the Kur xxxiv. 50,<br>\
means فَلَا فَوْتَ لَهُمْ مِنًّا [And there shall be for<br>\
them no escaping from us], i. e. لَا يَفُوتُونَنَا [they<br>\
shall not escape us]. (Jel. [And Bd says the like;<br>\
adding, “by flight, or fortifying themselves. ”])<br>\
An Arab of the desert is related to have said,<br>\
الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِى لا يُفَاتُ وَلَا [expl. in art.<br>\
ليت) (T. And they assert that a man went<br>\
forth from his family, and when he returned, his<br>\
wife said to him, “If thou hadst been present<br>\
with us, we would have related to thee what hath<br>\
happened; ” whereupon he said to her, لَمْ تُفَاتِى<br>\
فَهَاتِى (M, Meyd) i. e. It has not escaped thee [lit.<br>\
thou hast not been escaped], so adduce what thou<br>\
hast [to tell]: the saying is a proverb. (Meyd.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5: and see 8, in three places. ―<br>\
-b3-  فَاتَ<br>\
is also syn. with فَادَ [as signifying He died; in<br>\
which sense the aor. is يَفُوتُ, and the inf. n. فَوْتٌ].<br>\
(A in art. فيد.) And ↓ أفْتِيتَ signifies He died<br>\
suddenly. (TA in art. فأت, q. v.)<br>\
4<br>\
افاتهُ الشَّىْءَ, (S, MA,) or الأَمْرَ, (K,) He<br>\
made the thing, or affair, to pass, or pass away,<br>\
from him [neglected by him; or he made the<br>\
time, or opportunity, of the doing, or performing,<br>\
thereof to pass, or pass away, from him neglected<br>\
by him; or he made the thing to escape him, or<br>\
become beyond his reach, so that he was unable to<br>\
attain it, or to do it, or to accomplish it: see 1,<br>\
second sentence]. (M, A, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تفوّت عَلَيْهِ فِى مَالِهِ means بِهِ ↓ فَاتَهُ, (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
T, S, M, O, K,) i. e. He acted exclusively of him,<br>\
(M,) [or passed him over], namely, his father,<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, T, M, O, *) in respect of his property,<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, T, &amp;c.,) i. e. his own property,<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, T,) by giving it away, (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
T, M, O,) and squandering it, (A &#39;Obeyd, T, M.)<br>\
without consulting him, or asking his permission:<br>\
(O, TA:) occurring in a trad., relating to a case<br>\
in which the Prophet ordered the father to cause<br>\
the property to be restored to his son; and informed him that the son had no right to act thus<br>\
to his father. (A &#39;Obeyd, T, O. *) ―<br>\

تفاوت has for its inf. n. تَفَاوُتٌ and تَفَاوَتٌ<br>\
and تَفَاوِتٌ, (S, M, O, K,) the second and third<br>\
of which are mentioned by AZ; the second is<br>\
said by ISk (who mentions this and the third, M)<br>\
to be of the dial. of the Kilábees, and the third is<br>\
mentioned by El-&#39;Ambaree; both anomalous, for<br>\
the inf. n. of a verb of the measure تَفَاعَلَ is تَفَاعُلٌ.<br>\
[in the copies of the S يتفاعل, and said to be so<br>\
in J&#39;s handwriting,] with damm to the ع except<br>\
in this instance (S. O:) but Sb said that there<br>\
is not among inf. ns. an instance of تَفَاعَلٌ nor of<br>\
تَفَاعِلٌ. (M.) مَا تَرَى فِى خَلْقِ الرَّحْمٰنِ مِنْ تَفَاوُتٍ,<br>\
(T, M, O, K,) or ↓ تَفَوُّتٍ, (T, O, K.) [the former<br>\
in the CK and the latter in other copies of the K,]<br>\
the latter being the reading of Hamzeh and Ks,<br>\
in the Kur [lxvii. 3], (O,) means Thou seest not<br>\
in the creation of the Compassionate, (M, O,) i. e.<br>\
in his creation of the heaven, (M,) any incongruity, or discordance; (T, M, O;) or any fault,<br>\
defect, or imperfection, so that the beholder might<br>\
say, “If it were thus, it were better; ” (T, O, K;)<br>\
thus the latter reading is expl. by Es-Suddee; (T,<br>\
O, TA;) and Fr says that both readings have<br>\
one meaning: (T, TA:) you say of a thing ↓ تفوّت<br>\
and تفاوت. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And one says, تفاوت الشَّيْآنِ<br>\
The two things were far apart, one from the other;<br>\
or widely distinct or separated; (S, O, K;) or<br>\
differed, or were different. (Msb.) And تَفَاوَتَا<br>\
فِى الفَضْلِ They two were distinct, or dissimilar,<br>\
in respect of excellence, (Msb,) or فِى الشَّرَفِ [in<br>\
eminence, or nobility]. (A.)<br>\

إِفْتَوَتَ see 1, first and second sentences. ―<br>\
-b2-  As,<br>\
relating the verse of Ibn-Mukbil,<br>\
يَا حُرَّ أَمْسَيْتُ شَيْخًا قَدْ وَهَى بَصَرِى<br>\
وَافْتِيتَ مَا دُونَ يَوْمِ لبَعْثِ مِنْ عُمُرِى<br>\
[which may be rendered O ingenuous woman, (حُرَّ<br>\
being an abbreviation of حُرَّةٌ,) I have become an<br>\
old man, my sight has become weak, and what is<br>\
anterior to the day of resurrection, of my life, has<br>\
been passed, or has run out like water poured<br>\
forth (فَرِغَ)], says, it is from الفَوْتُ, and الاِفْتِيَاتُ<br>\
[app. as the inf. n. of the pass. v. افتيت used in<br>\
this verse] signifies الفَرَاغُ. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 1,<br>\
last sentence. ―<br>\
-b4-  الاِفْتِيَاتُ signifies also The<br>\
betaking oneself, or applying oneself, before another<br>\
or others, or hastily, (S, O, Msb,) to a thing, (S,<br>\
O,) or to the doing of a thing, (Msb,) without<br>\
obeying him who should be obeyed, (S, O,) or following his own opinion only, without consulting<br>\
him who had the best right to order in the case:<br>\
(Mgh, * Msb:) you say, افتات عَلَيْهِ بِأَمْرِ كَذَا i. e.<br>\
بِهِ ↓ فَاتَهُ [app. meaning He so betook himself, &amp;c.,<br>\
in opposition to him: or فاته به may be here used<br>\
in the sense in which it is expl. above voce تَفَوَّتَ].<br>\
(S, O.) And you say, فُلَانٌ لَا يُفْتَاتُ عَلَيْهِ Such a<br>\
one, nothing is to be done without his order; (S, O,<br>\
K; *) and so عليه ↓ لَا يُفَاتُ; (Har p. 63;) or لَا<br>\
يُفْتَاتُ عَلَيْهِ شَىْءٌ دُونَ أَمْرِهِ [which means the same].<br>\
(Msb.) أَمِثْلِى يُفْتَاتُ عَلَيْهِ فِى بَنَاتِهِ, (T, M, O,)<br>\
or فِى أَمْرِ بَنَاتِهِ, (S, TA,) occurs in a trad., (S, M,<br>\
Mgh, O, TA,) meaning Shall such a one as I<br>\
[am] have anything done in respect of his<br>\
daughters without his order? (Mgh, * TA;) and<br>\
was said by &#39;Abd-Er-Rahmán the son of Aboo-Bekr to his sister &#39;Áïsheh, on the occasion of her<br>\
having given in marriage his daughter, the elder<br>\
Hafsah, during his absence, to El-Mundhir the<br>\
son of Ez-Zubeyr. (T, * O, TA. *) And you say,<br>\
افتات عَلَيْهِ فِى شَىْءٍ, and بشَىْءٍ ↓ فَاتَهُ, meaning He<br>\
brought to pass a thing exclusively of him [i. e., of<br>\
another person, without the latter&#39;s having any<br>\
part therein]. (TA.) And افتات عَلَيْهِ فى كَذَا,<br>\
and عَلَيْهِ فِيهِ ↓ تفوّت, He followed his own opinion<br>\
only, exclusively of him [i. e., of another], in the<br>\
disposal, or management, of such a thing: the<br>\
verbs being trans. by means of عَلَى because<br>\
implying the meaning of الثَّغَلُّب. (TA.) And<br>\
افتات عَلَيْهِ فِى الأَمْرِ, (M, K, * TA,) and ↓ تفوّت<br>\

affair. (M, MA, K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And افتات بِأَمْرِهِ<br>\

hemz, meaning he was alone in his affair; and<br>\
in like manner one says, بِرَأْيِهِ in his opinion. (TA.<br>\
[See also art. فأت.]) ―<br>\
-b6-  And افتات الكَلَامَ He<br>\
originated, or excogitated, the speech: (O, K, TA:)<br>\
and he extemporized the speech; spoke it without<br>\
consideration, or thought, or preparation, or without pausing, or hesitating; as also اِفْتَلَتَهُ. (TA.)<br>\

his mouth and of his spear and of his hand, or<br>\
arm (in several copies of the K erroneously<br>\
written فَوْتُ)] mean where he sees it but will not<br>\
[be able to] reach it, or attain it. (K, TA.) A<br>\
man said to another, reviling him, [or rather said<br>\
of him,] جَعَلَ اللّٰهُ رِزْقَهُ فَوْتَ فَمِهِ i. e. [May God<br>\
make his sustenance to be beyond the reach of his<br>\
mouth,] where he shall see it and shall not attain<br>\
it. (S, O. [And the like is said in the M and<br>\
A.]) And one says, هُوَ مِنِّى فَوْتَ الرُّمْحِ [He, or<br>\

by Sb among what are peculiarly adverbial<br>\
expressions. (M.) And أَفْلَتَنَا فُلَانٌ فَوْتَ اليَدِ and<br>\
فَوْتَ الظُّفْرِ [Such a one escaped from us beyond<br>\
the reach of a hand, or an arm, and beyond the<br>\
reach of a finger-nail]. (A. [Golius, as on the<br>\
authority of the A, has ظُفْرٍ ↓ فُوَيْتَ, which he<br>\
explains as syn. with فَوْتَ يَدٍ; but it signifies A<br>\
little beyond the reach of a finger-nail.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَسْمَعُ<br>\

فَوْاتٌ an inf. n. of 1. (S, * M, &amp;c.) ―<br>\

مَوْتٌ الفَوَاتِ Sudden death: (S, M, A, O, K:) likewise termed المَوْتُ الفَوَاتُ and المَوْتُ الفُوَاتُ.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) You say, مَاتَ مَوْتَ الفَوَاتِ He died<br>\
a sudden death. (S, O.) The Prophet, passing<br>\
by a leaning wall, quickened his pace; and being<br>\
asked wherefore he did so, answered, أَخَافُ مَوْتَ<br>\
الفَوَاتِ [I fear sudden death]. (O.)<br>\
فُوَيْتٌ One who follows his, or her, own opinion<br>\
