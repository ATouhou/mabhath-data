فَقَهَ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. فِقْهٌ, the<br>\
verb being like عَلِمَ and the inf. n. like عِلْمٌ, in<br>\
measure and in meaning, (TA,) or فَقَهٌ; (JK;<br>\
[and the same seems to be implied in the Msb and<br>\
the K;]) and فَقُهَ; (Msb, K;) He had, or possessed, what is termed فِقْهٌ, meaning understanding,<br>\
(S, K,) and knowledge, and intelligence, and especially knowledge of the law (عِلْمُ الدِّينِ): (K:)<br>\

termed فِقْةٌ as a faculty firmly rooted in his mind:<br>\

as intrans.]: and he was, or became, [a فَقِيه, q. v.,<br>\
or] equal to the فُقَهآء. (TA in art. علم: see علم.)<br>\

rendered Such a one will not understand nor comprehend: but the two verbs are exactly syn.].<br>\
(S.) And to the witness one says, كَيْفَ فَقَاهَتُكَ لِمَا<br>\

of (or how understandest thou) what we have<br>\
made thee to witness?]: it is not said to any<br>\

K, TA;) and (K) so ↓ افقههُ, (Msb, K,) or he<br>\
made him to understand. (S, Mgh.) It is said<br>\
in a trad., اَللّٰهُمَّ عَلِّمْهُ الدِّينَ وَفَقِّهْهُ فِى التَّأْوِيلِ i. e.<br>\
O God, teach him الدين [app. here meaning the<br>\
science of the law] and [instruct him in] the تأويل<br>\
[or interpretation, &amp;c.,] and the meaning thereof.<br>\
(TA.) And you say, الشَّىْءَ ↓ أَفْقَهْتُكَ I made thee<br>\
to understand, (S, Msb, *) or I taught thee, (Msb,)<br>\
the thing. (S, Msb.) And ↓ أَفْقَنْتُهُ I explained to<br>\

[meaning the science of the law]: (JK:) or he<br>\
took, or applied himself, to the acquisition of الفِقْه<br>\
[meaning thus]. (S, TA.) And تفقّه فِى العِلْمِ<br>\
is like تَعَلَّمَ [meaning He became, or made himself, learned, or thoroughly learned, in science].<br>\
(Msb.) لِيَتَفَقَّهُوا فِى الدِّينِ, in the Kur ix. 123,<br>\
means That they may task themselves to obtain<br>\
understanding in الدّيَنْ [i. e. the law, or religion<br>\

فِقْهٌ [as a simple subst.] signifies Understanding<br>\
(S, Msb, K) of a thing; (Msb, K;) and knowledge thereof; (Msb, K;) and intelligence: (K:)<br>\
accord. to IF, any knowledge of a thing is thus<br>\
termed: (Msb:) [hence فِقْهُ اللُّغَةِ The science of<br>\
lexicology is the title of a work written by him;<br>\
and of another work, by Eth-Tha&#39;álibee:] and,<br>\

بْنُ كَلَدَةَ), who was also called طَبِيبُ العَرَبِ [as<br>\
is said in the S in art. ازم], because this appellation is syn. with the former; but IKh and El-<br>\
Hareeree do not mean by فقيها لعرب any particular<br>\
person. (Mz, close of the 39th نوع.) ―<br>\

and anomalous, as applied to women: ISd says,<br>\
“ in my opinion, he, of the Arabs, who says فُقَهَآء<br>\
[in speaking of women] takes no account of the<br>\
fem. ة: it is like فُقَرَآءُ applied to women. ” (TA.)<br>\
[In Egypt, the appellation فِقِى, a vulgar corruption of فَقِيه, is now applied to A schoolmaster;<br>\
and to a person who recites the Kur-án &amp;c. for<br>\

woman, who responds to her (K, TA) in what she<br>\
says; because she catches and retains quickly,<br>\
and understands, what she [the former] says, and<br>\

seeks, or desires, to understand: ”] it is said in a<br>\
