فَلُ3َ, inf. n. فَلٌّ, (M, TA,) He<br>\
broke it, or notched it, in its edge, (M, K,)<br>\
namely, [a sword or the like, or] anything; (M;)<br>\
and so ↓ فللّٰهُ, (K, TA,) [or this signifies he did so<br>\
much, or in many places,] inf. n. تَفْلِيلٌ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And i. q. كَسَرَهُ [app. as meaning He broke<br>\
it, in an unrestricted sense; as well as in another<br>\
sense; as will be shown by what follows]. (S.)<br>\
وَلَا فَلُّوا لَهُ صَقاةً, i. e. [lit.] Nor did they break a<br>\
stone (كَسَرُوا حَجَرَا) belonging to him, was said<br>\
by &#39;Áïsheh in describing her father: she alluded<br>\
thereby to his strength in religion. (TA. [See<br>\
also قَرَعَ صَفَاتَهُ, in art. صفو; and see also مَغْمَزٌ.])<br>\
And [in like manner] one says, غَرْبَهُ ↓ استفلّ<br>\
meaning كَسَرَهُ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He broke his sharpness, or<br>\
vehemence, or valour]. (TA.) And فَلَّ الجَيْشَ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb,) or القَوْمَ, (M, K,) aor. and inf. n.<br>\
as above, (M, O, Msb,) He defeated (هَزَمَ, S,<br>\
M, O, K, or كَسَرَ, Msb) the army, or military<br>\
force, (S, O, Msb,) or the people, or party. (M,<br>\
K.) And مَنْ قَلَّ ذَلَّ وَمَنْ أَمِرَفَلَّ, (S, Meyd, O,)<br>\
a prov., (Meyd, O,) meaning He who has few<br>\
aiders is overcome, [or becomes abased], and he<br>\
who has many relations [or who possesses authority<br>\
to command] defeats (فَلَّ) his enemies. (Meyd.<br>\
[In Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov., ii. 683, a different<br>\
(and I think a wrong) reading is given, with قَلَّ<br>\
in the place of فَلَّ; though the reading with فَلَّ<br>\
is added.]) شَجَّكِ أَوْ فَلَّكِ أَوْ جَمَعَ كُلًّا لَكِ, in the<br>\
story of Umm-Zara, is said to mean, Whether he<br>\
wound thee by smiting thy head, or break a limb<br>\
[of thee], or combine the two deeds to thee: or by<br>\
فلّك is meant altercate, or wrangle, with thee:<br>\
(TA, in two places:) or the meaning [of فلّك] is<br>\
defeat thee [so I render كَسَرَكِ]; or take away thy<br>\
property; or defeat thee (كَسَرَكِ) with his altercation and his censure. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  فَلَّ عَنْهُ عَقْلُهُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
فَلَ3َ, [in the CK (erroneously)<br>\
فَلُ3َ,] His intellect,<br>\
or intelligence, departed from him, and then returned. (M, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
فَلَّ3َ see above, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  تَفْلِيلٌ [as inf. n.<br>\
of the pass. v. فُلِّلَ] means The state of being<br>\
broken, or notched, [much, or in many places,] in<br>\
the edge of a knife, or in the edges of the teeth,<br>\
(T, TA,) and the like, (T,) [i. e.] and also in [the<br>\
edge of] a sword. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
افلّت الأَرْضُ The land became such as is<br>\
termed فِلّ [q. v.]. (AHn, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And أَفَلّ,<br>\
(Fr, T,) and أَفْلَلْنَا, (S, O,) He (a man, Fr, T,)<br>\
and we, (S, O,) became in a land such as is<br>\
termed فِلّ, (Fr, T, S, O,) upon which rain had<br>\
not fallen: (Fr, T:) or the latter means we trod<br>\
a land (M, K) such as is termed فِلّ (M) or such<br>\
as is termed فَلّ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And افلّ (assumed tropical:)  He (a man,<br>\
S, M, O) lost, or became deprived of, his property: (S, M, O, K:) from فِلٌّ applied to land.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And in like manner, one says, افلّ الدّهْرُ<br>\
مَالَهُ (assumed tropical:)  [Time, or fortune, deprived him of his property]. (O.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَفَلَّ3َ see the next paragraph, in three places:<br>\
-A2-  and see also R. Q. 1, in two places [in each<br>\
of which the verb is most probably, I think,<br>\
mistranscribed].<br>\
7<br>\
انفلّ It became broken, or notched, in its<br>\
edge; as also ↓ افتلّ, and ↓ تفلّل; (M, K, TA;)<br>\
said of [a sword or the like, or of] anything;<br>\
(M;) the first quasi-pass. of فَلَّهُ, as is also the<br>\
second; but the third is quasi-pass of فلَّلَهُ [and<br>\
implying that it was so much, or in many places,<br>\
or said of several things or of several parts of a<br>\
thing]; (TA;) [therefore] one says [of a sword],<br>\
مَضَارِبُهُ ↓ تَفَلَّلَتْ, meaning تَكَسَّرَتْ [i. e. Its edges<br>\
(for the swords of the Arabs in the older times<br>\
were generally two-edged), or its parts for striking, became broken, or notched, much, or in many<br>\
places]; (S, TA;) and one says, انفلّ سِنُّهُ, (T,<br>\
TA,) meaning [simply] His tooth became broken,<br>\
or notched, in its edge. (TA.) And انفلّوا They<br>\
became defeated; (S, * M, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ تفلّلوا [but this has an intensive signification].<br>\
(M, K.)<br>\

إِفْتَلَ3َ see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَفْلَ3َ see 1, former half. ―<br>\
-b2-  استفلّ الشَّىْءَ He took<br>\
of the thing the least portion, (M, K,) because of<br>\
its difficulty (لِعُسْرِهِ), (M,) or such as the tenth<br>\
part thereof (كَعُشْرِهِ): (K:) or الاِستِفْلَالُ signifies<br>\
the obtaining a little thing from a difficult place;<br>\
from a place of the seeking of a right, or due, or<br>\
of a gift; it having no other object than a thing<br>\
of little account. (T.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
فَلْفَلَ He walked with an elegant and<br>\
a proud and self-conceited gait, with an affected<br>\
inclining of the body from side to side; (T, O,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ تَفَلْفَلَ: (TA:) or both signify he<br>\
walked thus, with short steps: (K:) or ↓ تفلفل<br>\
signifies [simply] he went with short steps; (En-Nadr, O;) or so ↓ تفلّل. (T accord. to the TT.)<br>\
-A2-  And He rubbed and cleaned his teeth with the<br>\
[stick called] سِوَاك; (T, O, K;) as also ↓ تفلفل;<br>\
(IAar, O, K;) or so ↓ تفلّل. (T accord. to the<br>\
TT.)<br>\
-A3-  فلفل الطَّعَامَ and الشَّرَابَ He peppered<br>\
the food and the wine or beverage. (M.)<br>\
-A4-<br>\
[And فلفل الشَّعَرَ He made the hair very crisp, or<br>\
such as we term woolly, like that of the negro:<br>\
see the pass. part. n., below.]<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَفَلْفَلَ: see R. Q. 1, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  Said of the hair of a negro, It became very<br>\
crisp [or such as we term woolly]. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And تفلفل قَادِمَتَا الضَّرْعِ The two anterior teats of<br>\
the udder became black. (S, O, K.)<br>\
يَا فُلُ, (S in this art. and in art. فلن, and K<br>\
and TA in the latter art.,) meaning يَا فُلَانُ [O<br>\
such a one], (S &amp;c.,) with refa and without tenween, (TA,) is sometimes said to one person,<br>\
[i. e. to a man,] and يَا فُلَانِ to two persons, and<br>\
يَا فُلُونَ to a pl. number; and يَا فُلَةُ to a female,<br>\
and يَا فُلَتَانِ to two females, and يَا فُلَاتُ to a pl.<br>\
number of females, (K, TA,) and sometimes يَا<br>\
فُلَاةُ, (K, * TA,) thus correctly, of the dial. of<br>\
some of the tribe of Temeem, in the copies of<br>\
the K erroneously written يا فُلَاتُ, (TA,) is said,<br>\
and some say يَا فُلَ, [in the CK يافلُ, but correctly يافُلَ, i. e., as is said in the TA, بِنَصْبِ<br>\
اللَّامِ,] meaning يَا فُلَةُ: (K, TA:) [J says,] يَا<br>\
فُلُ, without teshdeed, said in calling to a person,<br>\
is apocopated from يَا فُلَانُ; not formed in the<br>\
way of تَرْخِيم, for if it were an instance of ترخيم<br>\
they would say يَا فُلَا: (S in this art.:) [or,]<br>\
accord. to Sb, يَا فُلُ is not held to be an instance<br>\
of a word from which is elided something that<br>\
is retained when it is not [thus] used in calling to<br>\
a person, but the noun in this case is made to be<br>\
of two letters in the manner of دَمٌ [which is originally دَمَوٌ or دَمًى or دَمْىٌ], and it is thus made<br>\
to be of two letters because a word that is used<br>\
in calling to a person or thing is a subject for<br>\
elision: (M in this art.:) and sometimes فُل was<br>\
used otherwise than in calling to a person, by<br>\
poetic license, as in the saying of Abu-n-Nejm,<br>\
فِى لَجَّةٍ أَمْسِكْ فُلَانًا عَنْ فُلِ<br>\
(S and M in this art.,) meaning عن فُلَانٍ [i. e.<br>\
In, or amid, a multitude of cries, or noises:<br>\
(thus expl. in the S:) withhold thou such a one<br>\
from such a one]: (S in art. فلن:) and Sb disallowed the saying فُلُ as meaning فُلَان [in the<br>\
CK (erroneously) يا فُلُ as meaning يا فُلَانُ] except [in the vocative form of speech and] in<br>\
poetry: (M and K and TA in art. فلن:) [but]<br>\
they said [also] فُلُ بْنُ فُلِ, [said to be] an instance<br>\
of an elision, (T and M in art. فلن,) i. e. of the<br>\
elision of a final و [accord. to some, who hold<br>\
فُلَانٌ to be originally فُلْوَانٌ]; (T;) like as they<br>\
said هَىُّ بْنُ بَىٍّ: (T, M:) and أَىْ فُلْ, with the<br>\
ل quiescent, occurs in a trad. respecting the resurrection; meaning يَا فُلَانُ: (TA:) Ibn-Buzurj<br>\
says that some of the tribe of اسد [i. e. Asd or<br>\
Asad] say يا فل [app. يَافُلُ, without any variation,] in calling to a man and to two men and to<br>\
a pl. number of men and to a female: (TA in art.<br>\
فلن:) accord. to As, one says يَا فُلُ and يَا فُلَاهْ;<br>\
he who says يَا فُلُ saying thus [when he pauses<br>\
after it and] when he goes on, making the noun<br>\
marfooa without tenween; whereas he who says<br>\
يَافُلَاهْ says thus when he is silent after it, retaining the ه [which is termed the ه of pausation].<br>\
but when he goes on he rejects the ه and makes<br>\
the noun to be mansoob, saying [for ex.] يَا فُلَا قُلْ<br>\
[O such a one, say]. (T and TA in art. فلن.)<br>\
[See also مُضَمَّنٌ (in art. ضمن), last sentence.]<br>\
فَلٌّ A break, or notch, in the edge, (ISk, T, S,<br>\
M, O, Msb, K,) of a sword, (ISk, T, S, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) [or the like,] or of anything; (M;) and so<br>\
↓ فَلَّةٌ [i. e. a single break, or notch, in the edge,] of<br>\
a sword: (TA:) pl. of the former فُلُولٌ, (ISk,<br>\
T, S, M, O, Msb, K,) of which an ex. occurs in<br>\
a verse cited voce بَيْدَ: (O, TA:) it has been<br>\
said that فُلُولٌ is an inf. n.; but it is more correctly said to be pl. of فَلٌّ. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A<br>\
portion that has fallen off from a thing, like the<br>\
filings of gold and of silver, and the sparks of<br>\
fire: (M, K, TA:) pl. فُلُولٌ. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And<br>\
A company (M, K, TA) of men; (TA;) as also<br>\
↓ فَلِيلٌ: (M, K, TA:) pl. of the former فُلُولٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And it is [an epithet] applied to a<br>\
number of men, (S, M, O, K, [in the CK in this<br>\
case, erroneously, فُلٌّ,]) and to a single man, (S,<br>\
O,) signifying Defeated; (S, M, O, K;) and<br>\
↓ فُلَّى also signifies thus, applied to a كَتِيبَة [i. e.<br>\
a military force, or troop, &amp;c.]; (AA, T, O, K;)<br>\
like فُرَّى: (AA, T, O:) one says رَجُلٌ فَلٌّ and<br>\
قَوْمٌ فَلٌّ, and sometimes [when speaking of a<br>\
number of men] they said فُلُولٌ and فِلَالٌ; (S,<br>\
O;) accord. to the copies of the K, the pl. is<br>\
فُلُولٌ and أَفْلَالٌ; but correctly the latter is فُلَّالٌ,<br>\
like رُمَّانٌ, as in the M; (TA;) [i. e.] the pl. is<br>\
فُلُولٌ and فُلَّالٌ: and [of فَلٌّ used in a pl. sense<br>\
it is said that] it must be either a quasi-pl. n. or<br>\
[originally] an inf. n.: if the former, the sing.<br>\
should by rule be فَالٌّ, the case being like شَارِبٌ<br>\
and شَرْبٌ, [of which the former is a sing, and the<br>\
latter is a quasi-pl. n.,] and فَالٌّ is of the measure<br>\
فَاعِلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: and<br>\
فلول is not necessarily pl. of فَلٌّ, but is rather pl.<br>\
of فَالٌّ; for the pl. of the quasi-pl. n. is extr.,<br>\
like the pl. of the pl.: (M, TA: *) and as to فَلَّالٌ,<br>\
it is necessarily pl. of فَالٌّ, for فَعْلٌ is not of the<br>\
forms that have فُعَّالٌ as the measure of a pl.:<br>\
(M, TA:) if it [i. e. فَلٌّ] be [originally] an inf. n.,<br>\
[this accounts for its being applied alike to a<br>\
number of men and to a single man, which is not<br>\
mentioned in the M, or] it is like نَسْجٌ in the sense<br>\
of مَنْسُوجٌ in the phrase نَسْجُ اليَمَنِ. (M.)<br>\
-A4-  Also<br>\
Land affected with drought or barrenness; as also<br>\
↓ فِلٌّ: or [i. e. the former accord. to the K, but<br>\
app. each accord. to the text of the M as given<br>\
in the TT,] such as is rained upon but does not<br>\
produce plants or herbage: (AO, M, K:) or such<br>\
as the rain has failed to fall upon during several<br>\
years: or such as is not rained upon between two<br>\
lands that have been rained upon: (M, K:) or,<br>\
accord. to AO, this is termed خَطِيطَةٌ; فلّ having<br>\
the second of the meanings expl. in this sentence:<br>\
(M:) or upon which rain has not fallen: (TA:)<br>\
[in this sense, in the TT, as from the T, written<br>\
فِل [for ↓ فِلّ]: and so in the same, as from the T<br>\
and M, in the sense here following:] or in which<br>\
is nothing; (T, M, * K; *) so says IAar; whence,<br>\
he adds, الفَلَاةُ; but [Az says] I do not think<br>\
that it is taken thence: (T:) the pl. is like the<br>\
sing., [or rather the word used as a sing. is likewise used as a pl.,] and أَفْلَالٌ, (M, K,) this pl.<br>\
form being sometimes used: (M:) or the pl. of<br>\
↓ الفِلُّ is أَفْلَالٌ; and one says also أَرْضٌ أَفْلَالٌ.<br>\
(T.)<br>\
-A5-  And A sort of cloth made of the hard<br>\
fibres of flax. (TA.)<br>\
فَلٌّ a term for يَاسَمِين مُضَاعَذ [Double jasmine],<br>\
which is [rendered so] either بِالتَّرْكِيب [an expression meaning, as used in the present day, by<br>\
grafting], or by slitting the stem thereof and inserting into it the [additional] jasmine [app.<br>\
meaning by budding]: it is a flower of pure<br>\
whiteness; and the rubbing oneself with its leaves<br>\
perfumes the body: (TA:) [this name, or, more<br>\
commonly, ↓ فِلّ, is now applied to the Arabian<br>\
jasmine (jasminum sambac), or, as Forskål says<br>\
(Flora Aegypt. Arab. p. cii.), nyctanthes sambac,<br>\
mentioned by him among the plants cultivated in<br>\
El-Yemen.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Freytag, misled by the CK, has<br>\
assigned to this word a meaning belonging to<br>\
فَلٌّ.]<br>\
فِلٌّ Land in which is no herbage; (K;) or land<br>\
not rained upon, and in which is no herbage. (S,<br>\
O.) See also فَلٌّ, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  غَدَا فِلًّا مِنَ<br>\
الطَّعَامِ, with kesr, means [He went forth early in<br>\
the morning] devoid of food. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فِلٌّ<br>\
مِنَ الخَيْرِ occurs in a verse, (S, O,) in the poetry<br>\
of &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Rawáhah and in that of<br>\
Hassán, (S, O,) meaning Devoid of good. (S,<br>\
TA.) [See عَلٌّ.]<br>\
-A2-  And Such as has become<br>\
thin, of hair. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  See also فُلٌّ.<br>\
فَلَّةٌ: see فَلٌّ, first sentence.<br>\
فَلَلٌ, in a sword [or the like], The state of<br>\
having breaks, or notches, in the edge. (S, O.)<br>\
فَلِيلٌ: see أَفَلُّ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to the tusk, or<br>\
canine tooth, of a camel, Broken (S, M, O, K)<br>\
in the edge. (S, O.)<br>\
-A2-  See also فَلٌّ, first quarter.<br>\
-A3-  Also, and ↓ فَلِيلَةٌ, a quantity of hair collected<br>\
together: (S, M, O, K:) the two words are either<br>\
of the class of سَلٌّ and سَلَّةٌ [which are exactly<br>\
syn., each with the other,] or are an instance of<br>\
the pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] that does not differ<br>\
from its sing. [or n. un.] except in [its not having]<br>\
the [affix] ة: (M:) in one instance, occurring in<br>\
a trad., the latter is said to signify a كُبَّة [or portion convolved, or glomerated, or formed into a<br>\
ball] of hair, or, as Z says, app. of [the silk<br>\
called] دِمَقْس: the pl. [of either] is فَلَائِلُ. (TA.)<br>\
Hence, (O,) ↓ فَلِيلَةٌ signifies also The mane of<br>\
the lion. (O, TA.) In the saying of Sá&#39;ideh<br>\
Ibn-Ju-eiyeh,<br>\
وَغُودِرَ ثَاوِيًا وَتَأَوَّبَتْهُ<br>\
مُذَرَّعَةٌ أُمَيْمَ لَهَا فَلِيلُ<br>\
[And he was left remaining, and a hyena having<br>\
stripes upon its arms, (thus مُذَرَّعَةٌ as used in this<br>\
verse is expl. in the TA in art. ذدع, q. v.,) a<br>\
young mother, (أُمَيْمَ being an instance of تَرْخِيم,<br>\
used by poetic license, for أُمَيْمَةُ, a dim. of أُمٌّ,)<br>\
and therefore unusually fierce, having a mane, or<br>\
having convolved, or glomerated, hair, came to<br>\
him at night, or in the beginning of the night],<br>\
the last word is expl. by Suh, in the R, as meaning the عَرْف [so in my original, an obvious mistranscription for عُرْف, with damm]; but by Skr<br>\
as meaning شَعَر مَكْبُوب. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فَلِيلٌ<br>\
signifies also [The membranous fibres that grow<br>\
at the base of the branches of the palm-tree, called]<br>\
لِيف: (M, K:) so in the dial. of Hudheyl: (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ فُلِفُلٌ signifies the same. (K.)<br>\
فَلِيلَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
فُلَّى: see فَلُّفِلّيَّةٌ, in the former half.<br>\
فِلِّيَّةٌ, (T, * K, TA,) like عِلِّيَّةٌ, (TA,) or فَلِّيَّةٌ,<br>\
(O, *) [in the TT, as from the T, and in the O.<br>\
written without the sign of teshdeed to the ل (app.<br>\
because it is sufficiently indicated by the heading<br>\
of the art. and by the pl. of this word), and in<br>\
the CK, erroneously, فِلْيَة,] Land upon which the<br>\
rain [that should have been that] of its year has<br>\
not fallen until the falling of the rain of the next<br>\
year upon it: pl. فَلَالِىُّ: (ISh, T, O, K:) [and<br>\
Az says,] I have heard them call thus (i. e. by<br>\
the sing.) land in which is nothing; like فِلٌّ as<br>\
expl. by IAar. (T.)<br>\
فُلْفُلٌ, (S, M, O, Msb, K,) also pronounced<br>\
↓ فِلْفِلٌ, (K,) but the vulgar pronounce it [thus]<br>\
with kesr, (O,) and the pronouncing it with kesr<br>\
is said to be not allowable, (Msb,) a word of<br>\
Pers. origin, (M,) arabicized, from پِلْپِل, with<br>\
kesr, (O,) [or پُلْپُل; i. e. Pepper;] a sort of<br>\
berry, (حَبٌّ, S, O, K,) brought from India, (O,<br>\
K, *) well known, (S, M, O,) not growing in the<br>\
land of the Arabs, but often mentioned in their<br>\
language: AHn was informed by one who had<br>\
seen it that its tree is just like the pomegranate;<br>\
(M, TA;) but Dáwood the hakeem adds that it<br>\
is taller; (TA;) between the pair of leaves thereof<br>\
are two fruit-stalks, regularly disposed, each fruitstalk of the length of the finger; and it is green,<br>\
and is then plucked, and spread in the shade, and<br>\
becomes black and shrivelled; and it [the tree]<br>\
has thorns, like those of the pomegranate: when<br>\
it [i. e. the fruit] is fresh and moist, it is preserved<br>\
with water and salt until it becomes mature, when<br>\
it is eaten like as preserved herbs are eaten upon<br>\
the tables of food, and it is a digestive: the n. un.<br>\
is ↓ فُلْفُلَةٌ [app. meaning a peppercorn, like حَبَّةُ<br>\
فُلْفُلٍ: and حَبُّ فُلْفُلٍ means peppercorns, collectively]: (M, TA:) Dáwood says, in the “ Tedhkireh,” that its leaves are thin, red next the tree<br>\
and green in the other direction, and its wood is<br>\
lank and soft: and it is white and black: (TA:)<br>\
the white is the better. (TA.) [A long description of its properties, with additions in the TA,<br>\
some of them well known and others fanciful, I<br>\
omit as being needless.] ―<br>\
-b2-  دَارُفُلْفُل, or ↓ دَارُفِلْفِل,<br>\
(accord. to different copies of the K,) [app.<br>\
دَارُفُلْفُلٌ, or perhaps دَارَفُلْفُلٌ, a compound of two<br>\
words (both originally Pers.) made one, as such<br>\
written in the K with the article (الدّارفلفل), and<br>\
perfectly declinable, because (although a compound of two nouns) it is not a proper name,] is<br>\
The tree of the فُلْفُل when it first bears fruit,<br>\
accord. to the K; but several writers declare that<br>\
the tree of [the] دار فلفل is not the same as the<br>\
tree of the فلفل: (MF, TA:) [دار فلفل is one of<br>\
the names now applied to long pepper, and is<br>\
commonly pronounced دَارْفِلْفِلْ:] it is [generally]<br>\
known in Egypt by the name of عِرْقُ الذَّهَبِ,<br>\
[another term, now used, for long pepper,] and<br>\
is called in Pers. پلپل دراز [i. e. پُلْپِلدَرَاز, the<br>\
latter of which words signifies “ long ”]: (TA:)<br>\
it increases the venereal faculty, causes the food<br>\
to digest; removes colic, (K, TA,) and flatulence;<br>\
(TA;) and is beneficial as a remedy against the<br>\
bite, or sting, of venomous reptiles, applied as a<br>\
