as also ↓ فقّر, (TA,) inf. n. تَفْقِيرٌ. (K, TA.) And<br>\
He dug a well to draw forth the water. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And فَقْرٌ signifies The boring, or perforating,<br>\
of beads for the purpose of stringing; (K;) [as<br>\
also تَفْقِيرٌ; for one says] ↓ فَقَّرْتُ [as well as فَقَرْتُ],<br>\
meaning I bored, or perforated, beads. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And The act of cleaving, slitting, or rending.<br>\
(O.) [See also 8.] ―<br>\

TA,] aor.<br>\
فَقُرَ and<br>\
فَقِرَ, inf. n. فَقْرٌ, (K,) He made an<br>\
incision in the nose [or muzzle] of the camel, (S,<br>\
O, K, TA,) the beast being refractory, (TA,)<br>\
with an iron instrument, (S, O, TA,) so as to<br>\
reach to the bone, (K, TA,) or nearly so, (TA,)<br>\
then put upon the place of the incision the [cord<br>\
called] جَرِير, (S, O, TA, *) with a [string such as<br>\
is termed] وَتَر wound upon it, (S, O,) to render<br>\
him tractable, or to train him, thereby: (S, O,<br>\
K, TA:) sometimes the refractory camel has<br>\
three incisions made in his muzzle; and when<br>\
his owner desires to render him tractable, and to<br>\
prevent him from being brisk above measure, he<br>\
puts the جرير upon the incision that is next to<br>\
his lip, and in consequence he governs him as he<br>\
will; and if he be between the refractory and the<br>\
tractable, he puts the جرير upon the intermediate<br>\
incision, and in consequence he exceeds in his<br>\
pace; and if he desire that he should stretch<br>\
forth and go without inconvenience to his owner,<br>\
he puts the جرير upon the uppermost incision.<br>\
(Aboo-Ziyád, L.) [The incision above mentioned<br>\
is termed ↓ فُقْرَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b5-  Hence, app., by a tropical<br>\
usage, فَقَرَ signifies (assumed tropical:)  He stigmatized a man:<br>\
Freytag has mentioned it as occurring in the<br>\
Deewán of the Hudhalees, and meaning “ satyra<br>\
perstrinxit eius vitia commemorans aliquem. ”]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
[فَقَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
فَقُرَ, inf. n. فَقْرٌ, He, or it, broke the فَقَار<br>\
(or vertebræ) of his back. ―<br>\

لِلْوَدِيَّةِ, (S, TA, *) or لِلْفَسِيلَةِ, (K, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
تَفْقِيرٌ; [and accord. to Golius, ↓ تفقّر, but for this<br>\
I have not found any authority;] He dug a hollow<br>\
such as is termed فَقِير [q. v.] for the shoot, or offset,<br>\
of a palm-tree. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فُقِّرَ, said<br>\
of anything, It was incised, or notched; and impressed, or marked. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Lth has erroneously assigned to تَفْقِيرٌ, a meaning belonging<br>\
to تَقْفِيزٌ, q. v. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
افقر He (a colt) became fit for riding upon<br>\
his فَقَار [or vertebræ]; like أَرْكَبَ: (O:) or he<br>\
(a colt, Msb), or it (the back of a colt, L), became<br>\
[strong in the vertebræ and] fit for being ridden.<br>\
(L, Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  افقرهُ نَاقَتَهُ, (S, O,) or بَعِيرَهُ, (ISk,<br>\
K,) or ظَهْرَ بَعِيرِهِ, (TA,) or بَعِيرًا, (Mgh,) or دَابَّتَهُ,<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, TA,) or المُهْرَ, (Msb,) He lent him the<br>\
vertebræ [meaning the back] of his she-camel, that<br>\
he might ride thereon: (S, O:) and he lent him<br>\
the back of his camel (ISk, K, TA) during a<br>\
journey, (ISk, TA) for carrying a burden, and<br>\
for riding, (ISk, K, TA,) to be returned afterwards: (ISk, TA:) and he lent him a camel, that<br>\
he might ride thereon; from فَقَار signifying the<br>\
“ vertebræ ” of the back: (Mgh:) and he lent<br>\
him his beast to ride as long as he pleased during<br>\
a journey and then to return it to him: (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
TA:) and he lent him the colt to ride upon its<br>\
vertebræ [or back]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, افقرهُ أَرْضَهُ<br>\
(tropical:)  He lent him his land for sowing. (TA, from a<br>\
trad.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَفْقَرَكَ الصَّيْدُ means The object of the<br>\
chase has enabled thee to have its vertebræ within<br>\
thy power; therefore shoot it, or shoot at it: (O,<br>\
TA:) or has enabled thee to have its side [which<br>\
is sometimes termed فُقْر] within thy power: (K:)<br>\
or has become near to thee. (TA.) [The Khaleefeh] El-Weleed the son of Yezeed the son of &#39;AbdEl-Melik is related to have said, أَفْقَرَ بَعْدَ مَسْلَمَةَ<br>\
الصَّيْدُ لِمَنْ رَمَى i. e. The object of the chase has<br>\
enabled the shooter at it to have its vertebræ<br>\
within his power after Meslemeh; meaning that,<br>\
since the death of his paternal uncle Meslemeh,<br>\
the territory of the Muslims had become assailable to him who might attempt it. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
افقرهُ also signifies He (i. e. God, S, O, K, or a<br>\
man, Msb) rendered him فَقِير [meaning poor, or<br>\
needy, &amp;c.]. (S, O, Msb, K.)<br>\
-A4-  مَا أَفْقَرَهُ [i. e.<br>\
How poor, or needy, &amp;c., is he!] and مَا أَغْنَاهُ<br>\
[which has the contr. meaning] are [said to be] anomalous; for their [respective primitive] verbs are<br>\
اِفْتَقَرَ and اِسْتَغْنَى, from either of which the verb<br>\
of wonder is not properly [or regularly] formed.<br>\
(S, O. [But see 8.])<br>\
5<br>\
ظَهَرَ قَبْلَنَا نَاسٌ يَتَفَقَّرُونَ العِلْمَ, occurring in a<br>\
trad., as some relate it, means [There appeared<br>\
before us men] eliciting what was recondite, or<br>\
obscure, of knowledge, and opening what was<br>\
closed thereof; from فَقَرْتُ البِئْرَ meaning “ I dug<br>\
the well to draw forth the water: ” but the reading commonly known is [يَتَقَفَّرُونَ, q. v.,] with the<br>\
ق before the ف. (IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2.<br>\
6<br>\
تفاقر He feigned the lowliness, or submissiveness, of poverty, humbling, or abasing, himself with<br>\
men. (K * and TA in art. بأس.)<br>\
8<br>\
افتقر He clave, slit, or rent; and opened:<br>\
[see also 1, fourth sentence:] hence its usage in a<br>\
trad. of &#39;Omar, in which, after his saying that<br>\
Imra-el-Keys was the foremost of the poets, and<br>\
had made the source of poetry to well forth abundantly to them, [see خَسَفَ,] he is related to have<br>\
added, وَافْتَقَرَ عَنْ مَعانٍ عُورٍأَصَحَّ بَصَرٍ: in saying<br>\
this, he attributed a sound and an opened sight to<br>\
the poetry, [which he thus personified,] and in<br>\
like manner he described obscure and occult<br>\
meanings by applying to them the epithet عُور<br>\
[generally meaning “ blind of one eye ”]: he<br>\
meant that Imra-el-Keys had made the meanings<br>\
of poetry clear and perspicuous, and unveiled<br>\
them, and shunned substitution and obscure diction: عَنْ with what is [to be understood as]<br>\
antecedently connected with it occupies the place<br>\
of a noun in the accus. case as a denotative of<br>\
state: it is as though he said, فَتَحَ لِلشِّعْرِأَصَحَّ<br>\
بَصَرٍ مُجَاوِزًا لِلْمَعَانِى العُورِمُتَخَطِيًا لَهَا [lit. He<br>\
opened, to poetry, a most sound vision, passing<br>\
over half-blind meanings]. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (O,)<br>\
He was, or became, فَقِير [meaning poor, or needy,<br>\
&amp;c.]; (S, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.;) and so ↓ فَقِرَ, aor.<br>\
فَقَرَ,<br>\
inf. n. فَقَرٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ فَقُرَ, aor.<br>\
فَقُرَ; (K;) or<br>\
they said افتقر, (Sb, Msb, TA,) like as they said<br>\
اِشْتَدَّ, (Sb, TA,) but they did not say فَقُرَ, (Sb,<br>\
Msb, TA,) like as they did not say شَدُدَ, (Sb, TA,)<br>\
افتقر serving them instead of فَقُرَ; (Msb;) nor<br>\
did they use any unaugmented form of this verb.<br>\
(Sb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And one says, افتقر إِلَيْهِ He, or it,<br>\
wanted, needed, or required, him, or it; [a phrase<br>\
of frequent occurrence; like فَقِيرٌ إِلَيْهِ;] i. q. اِحْتَاجَ<br>\
اليه. (TA in art. حوج.)<br>\
10<br>\
استفقر بَعِيرًا [He borrowed, or asked for the<br>\
loan of, the back of a camel, for carrying a burden<br>\
or for riding]. (See أَرْمَلُ.)<br>\
فَقْرٌ and ↓ فُقْرٌ signify the same, (S, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
but the latter is bad, (Lth, TA,) and sometimes<br>\
they said ↓ فُقُرٌ, (MF, TA,) Poverty, want, or<br>\
need; contr. of غِنًى: (K:) or the state of a man<br>\
when he has [only] what suffices for his household,<br>\
or those who dwell with him and whose maintenance is incumbent on him: (ISd, K:) [other<br>\
meanings are indicated by explanations of the<br>\
epithet فَقِيرٌ, q. v.:] ↓ مَفاَقِرُ [signifying needs, or<br>\
wants,] is said by some to be a pl. of فَقرٌ, anomalous, like مَشَابِهُ [pl. of شَبَهٌ] and مَلَامِحُ [pl. of<br>\
لَمْحَةٌ]: or it may be a pl. of ↓ مُفْقَرٌ, an inf. n. of<br>\
أَفْقَرَهُ; or pl. of ↓ مُفْقِرٌ; or it has no sing.: (TA:)<br>\
you say, ↓ سَدَّ اللّٰهُ مَفَاقِرَهُ God rendered him, or<br>\
may God render him, free from want; (S, Msb,<br>\
K;) [lit.] God supplied, or may God supply, his<br>\
various needs, or wants. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فَقْرٌ signifies also Anxiety; or disquietude, or trouble, of<br>\
mind: pl. فُقُورٌ: (O, K, TA:) one says, شَكَى إِلَيْهِ<br>\
فُقُورَهُ He complained to him of his anxieties; &amp;c.:<br>\
and it means also, his circumstances, and wants:<br>\
(TA:) [for,] accord. to IAar, the phrase فُقُورُ<br>\
النَّفْسِ is like شُقُورُهَا. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  See also فَقْرَةٌ.<br>\
فُقْرٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
The side: pl. فُقَرٌ, (K, TA,) which is extr. [in<br>\
respect of analogy]: mentioned by Kr. (TA.)<br>\
[See أَفْقَرَكَ الصَّيْدُ.]<br>\
فَقُرٌ: see فَقْرَةٌ.<br>\
فَقِرٌ: see فَقِيرٌ, former half, in two places.<br>\
فُقُرٌ: see فَقْرٌ.<br>\
فَقْرَةٌ: see فَقَارٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Accord. to the K, it signifies<br>\
also A certain plant; and its pl. [or rather the<br>\
coll. gen. n.] is ↓ فَقْرٌ: but the sing. [or n. un.] is<br>\
correctly ↓ فَقُرَةٌ, with fet-h and then damm, mentioned by Sb as a word of a rare form, of which<br>\
the pl. [or coll. gen. n.] is ↓ فَقُرٌ, as it has no<br>\
broken pl.; and expl. by Th. (TA.)<br>\
فُقْرَةٌ A hollow dug in the ground: pl. فُقَرٌ. (O,<br>\
K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The [incision termed] قُرْمَة<br>\
(IAar, O, TA) that is made in the nose [or muzzle]<br>\
(IAar, O) of the camel, (IAar, O, TA,) [in order<br>\
to render him tractable, (see 1, near the beginning,)] after which [if necessary] another is made,<br>\
[above it,] and then another, until he becomes<br>\
gentle: (IAar, O:) pl. [of pauc. أَفْقُرٌ, occurring<br>\
in the L, evidently as a pl. of فُقْرَةٌ in this sense,<br>\
and, of mult., but also used as a pl. of pauc.,]<br>\
فُقَرٌ. (O, TA.) Hence the saying of &#39;Aacute;ïsheh, in<br>\
relation to [the murder of] &#39;Othmán, [app. alluding<br>\
to its involving three violations, namely, the violation of the sacredness of the city in which it was<br>\
perpetrated and of the month in which it occurred<br>\
and of the person of the Khaleefeh,] بَلَغْتُمْ مِنْهُ<br>\
الفُقَرَ الثَّلَاثَ, meaning (tropical:)  Ye have done to him the<br>\
like of your deed to the camel above mentioned<br>\
[upon which ye have inflicted the three فُقَر]: thus<br>\
expl. by AZ. (TA.) Accord. to AHeyth, فُقَرٌ<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  Great, or grievous, or formidable, events.<br>\
(O.) And the three فُقَرَات of the son of Adam<br>\
are said to be (assumed tropical:)  The day of birth and the day of<br>\
death and the day of resurrection. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
The part, of a shirt, that is the place into which<br>\
the head is inserted. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Nearness. (K.)<br>\
And one says, هُوَ مِنِّى فُقْرَةً, meaning He is near<br>\
to me. (K, * TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also مُفْقِرٌ.<br>\
فِقْرَةٌ: see فَقَارٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence] الفِقَرَاتُ is a name of<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The star [or stars] in the خَرَزَات [meaning joints<br>\
of the tail] of Scorpio. (Kzw in his descr. of<br>\
Scorpio.) And فِقَرٌ signifies (assumed tropical:)  Certain ornaments,<br>\
moulded, or fashioned, in the form of the vertebra<br>\
of the back: (A, KT, TA, and Har p. 34:) one<br>\
of which is termed فِقْرَةٌ. (Har ibid.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
hence, (KT,) or as being likened to a vertebra<br>\
of the back, (S, O, KT,) (tropical:)  The best verse in an<br>\
ode is termed فِقْرَةٌ. (S, O, K, KT.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
hence, as being likened to the best verse in an<br>\
ode, فِقْرَهٌ means (tropical:) (tropical:)  Any choice phrase or sentence:<br>\
(KT:) one says, مَا أَحْسَنَ فِقَرَ كَلَامِهِ i. e. [How<br>\
beautiful are] the points, or points of wit, (سُكَت<br>\
[pl. of نُكْتَةٌ]) of his speech, or language! (A,<br>\

-b5-  And in like manner it is applied to signify (assumed tropical:)  The end [or final word] of every verse of<br>\
an ode and [of every clause] of a خُطْبَة [which is<br>\
in rhyming prose]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And (assumed tropical:)  [A pair of<br>\
clauses of rhyming prose, both ending with the<br>\
same rhyme; i. e.] the فِقْرَة is that which in<br>\
[rhyming] prose is like the verse in poetry. (Kull<br>\
p. 208.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A piece of land, such as is<br>\
termed قَرَاح [q. v.], for sowing. (O, K.)<br>\
-A3-  And<br>\
A thing that serves as a mark, or sign, (Lth, K,<br>\
TA,) to men contending, or competing, in shooting,<br>\
or casting, (Lth,) such as a mountain, (K,) or<br>\
such as a hill, or a hollow dug in the ground,<br>\
(Lth.) or a هَدَف [or butt, &amp;c.], (Lth, K, TA,)<br>\
and the like: (K, TA:) they say, in such contending or competing, أُرَامِيكَ مِنْ أَدْنَى فِقْرَةٍ [I<br>\
will contend, or compete, with thee in shooting, or<br>\
casting, from the nearest فقرة] and مِنْ أَبْعَدِ فِقْرَةٍ<br>\
[from the furthest فقرة]. (Lth, TA.)<br>\
فَقُرَةٌ: see فَقْرَةٌ.<br>\
فُقْرَى [The lending one a camel, &amp;c., to be ridden<br>\
or to carry a burden;] a subst. [similar to رُقْبَى<br>\
and عُمْرَى] from أَفْقَرَهُ نَاقَتَهُ (S) or بَعِيرَهُ. (K.)<br>\
فَقَارٌ The vertebra of the back; (S, * Msb, K;)<br>\
the bones of the spine, which are set in regular<br>\
order, one upon another, from the part where is<br>\
the كَاهِل to the عَجْب: (K, * TA:) [it is sometimes used as a sing., as in the S and O and K voce<br>\
طَبَقٌ: but properly] the sing., (Msb, K,) or n. un.,<br>\
(S, TA,) is ↓ فَقَارَةٌ, (S, Msb, K,) for which one<br>\
should not say فِقَارَةٌ, with kesr: (ISk, Msb:) and<br>\
↓ فِقْرَةٌ, of which the pl. is فِقَرٌ and فِقْرَاتٌ and فِقَرَاتٌ<br>\
and فِقِرَاتٌ, signifies the same as فَقَارَةٌ; (S, Msb,<br>\
K:) as does also ↓ فَقْرَةٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] فَقَارُ<br>\
الجَوْزَآءِ (assumed tropical:)  The three very bright stars [d and e and<br>\
z] disposed obliquely in the midst of the constellation الجوزآء [i. e. Orion]. (Har p. 456. [See art.<br>\

of A [celebrated] sword of the Prophet, (S, O, K,)<br>\
and afterwards, of &#39;Alee: it had previously belonged to El-&#39;As Ibn-Munebbih, who was slain<br>\
at Bedr, (O, K,) by &#39;Alee, by whom his sword<br>\
was given to the Apostle: (O:) accord. to Abu-l-&#39;Abbás [i. e. Th]. it was thus named because there<br>\
were in it small beautiful hollows [app. meaning<br>\
small scallops in the edge, such as some modern<br>\
swords have, for the more easy cleaving of coats<br>\
of mail]: it is also, accord. to some, called ذو<br>\
الفِقَار; but this is said by El-Khattábee to be<br>\
vulgar. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It (i. e. ذُوالفَقَارِ) is also used,<br>\
metaphorically, as meaning (tropical:)  The spear. (TA.)<br>\
فَقِيرٌ A hollow that is dug around the shoot, or<br>\
offset, of a palm-tree, when it is planted: (S, O:)<br>\

(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And it is said to signify A [hollowed]<br>\
trunk of a palm-tree, by means of which one<br>\

(IAth, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  As an epithet applied to a camel,<br>\
it means Having an incision [or two incisions or<br>\
three] made in his nose [or muzzle] in the manner<br>\
explained in the first paragraph of this art.; and<br>\
so ↓ مَفْقُورٌ. (K, TA.)<br>\

TA:) and فقير and ↓ مَفْقُورٌ, a man afflicted [lit.<br>\

-A4-  Hence, as though having the<br>\

جبر,) [but said to be irregularly formed from<br>\
اِفْتَقَرَ, like مَا أَفْقَرَهُ, q. v.,] Poor: or needy; contr.<br>\

which signifies one who possesses nothing; altogether destitute: (Aboo-&#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;Alà, ISk,<br>\
S, O, K:) or both mean destitute, i. e. possessing<br>\

opinion of ISk, (TA,) who cites the following<br>\
verse from a poem of Er-Rá&#39;ee in praise of<br>\
&#39;Abd-El-Melik Ibn-Marwán;<br>\
أَمَّا الفَقِيرُ الَّذِى كَانَتْ حَلُوبَتُهُ<br>\

[As to the فقير whose milch camel was sufficient<br>\
for his household, and nothing (more) was left to<br>\
him:] (S, O, TA:) As says that the مسكين is<br>\
better in condition than the فقير: and Yoo says<br>\
that the فقير is better in condition than the<br>\
مسكين; and adds, I asked an Arab of the desert,<br>\
Art thou فقير? and he answered, No, by God,<br>\
but rather مسكين: (S, O, TA:) or the former<br>\
signifies needy, needing, or wanting; a needer;<br>\
and the latter, one abased by need or want, or<br>\
otherwise; (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, O, K;) who, if abased<br>\
by need or want, may lawfully receive of the<br>\
poor-rate; but if abased otherwise than by<br>\
need or want, he may not receive of the poorrate; for he may be rich: (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh:) [الفَقِيرُ<br>\
إِلَى اللّٰهِ the needer of God, i. e., of God&#39;s help, &amp;c.,<br>\
and الفَقِيرُ إِلَى رَحْمَةِ اللّٰهِ the needer of the mercy of<br>\
God, are epithets which a man often writes before<br>\
his name:] it is said in the Kur [xxxv. 16], أَنْتُمُ<br>\
الفُقَرَآءُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ وَاللّٰهُ هُوَ الْغَنِىُّ الْحَمِيدُ, which is<br>\
explained as meaning Ye are the needers, or they<br>\
who stand in need, of God: [and God, He is the<br>\
Self-sufficient, the Praised in every case:] (O, *<br>\
TA: [see also the Kur xxviii. 24:]) or فقير signifies one who is crippled, or deprived of the power<br>\
of motion, by disease, or who suffers from a protracted disease, being weak, and who has no trade;<br>\
and one who has a mean trade that does not suffice<br>\
for his need; and مسكين, a beggar, who has a<br>\
trade that stands in some stead, (حِرْفَةٌ تَقَعُ مَوْقِعًا,)<br>\
but does not cause him and his household to be<br>\
without want; (Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, T, O, K;) so that<br>\
the former is in a harder condition than the latter<br>\
accord. to Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee; (T;) and it seems that<br>\
he is called فقير because of crippleness, or protracted disease, which prevents his freely employing himself in making gain: (Khálid Ibn-Yezeed:) As also says that the latter is in a<br>\
better condition than the former; (S, O, K;) and<br>\
so says Ahmad Ibn-&#39;Obeyd: (TA:) and as to<br>\
the verse of Er-Rá&#39;ee, cited above, it is said to<br>\
mean that the person there mentioned had a<br>\
milch camel in former times, but possessed it no<br>\
longer, and that لَمْ يُتْرَكْ لَهُ سَبَد means that<br>\
nothing was left to him: (Mgh:) the pl. of the<br>\
latter epithet is also applied in the Kur xviii. 78<br>\
to men possessing a ship, or boat, which is worth<br>\
a considerable sum; (Mgh;) whence Aboo-Bekr<br>\
holds the opinion of As to be correct: (TA:)<br>\
but it is urged in reply, that these men were<br>\
hirers, not owners, of the vessel, as appears from<br>\
one reading, [app. يُعَمَّلُونَ for يَعْمَلُونَ,] with<br>\
teshdeed: (TA:) or the former signifies one who<br>\
has neither property nor gain that suffices for his<br>\
need; and the latter, one who has property or<br>\
gain not sufficient for him: or, as some say, the<br>\
converse is the truth: (Bd in ix. 60:) or both<br>\
signify the same, (IAar, S, K,) one who possesses<br>\
nothing: (IAar, S:) or when they are used together, they differ in signification; and when used<br>\
separately, they both [sometimes] signify the<br>\
same: (El-Bedr El-Karáfee:) [see more voce<br>\
مِسْكِينٌ:] fem. with ة: (Msb, K:) pl. masc. فُقَرَآءُ;<br>\
(Msb, K;) pl. fem. فَقَائِرُ, (K,) and فُقَرَآءُ (Lh,<br>\
Msb, TA) like the masc., [said to be] the only<br>\
instance of the kind except سُفَهَآءُ as pl. of سَفِيهَةٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) [though فُقَهَآءُ, and perhaps some other<br>\
instances, should be added;] but ISd says, I<br>\
know not how this is. (TA.)<br>\
فَقَارَةٌ: see فَقَارٌ.<br>\
فَيْقَرٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
فَاقِرَةٌ [An act that breaks, or will break, the<br>\
vertebræ of the back: and hence,] (assumed tropical:)  a calamity,<br>\
or misfortune; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ فَيْقَرٌ: (S, O,<br>\
K:) or, accord. to Lth and others, such as breaks<br>\
the vertebræ of the back: (TA:) pl. فَوَاقِرُ. (Har<br>\
p. 399.) عَمِلَ بِهِ الفَاقِرَةَ is a prov., meaning He<br>\
did to him an act breaking, or that would break,<br>\
his vertebræ; or a calamity, or misfortune, as in<br>\
the Kur lxxv. 25: (Meyd:) [or, accord. to J, it<br>\
app. means he did to him that which would render<br>\
him tractable; for he says,] it is from the phrase<br>\
فَقَرْتُ أَنْفَ البَعِيرِ. (S. [This phrase in the S has<br>\
been strangely misunderstood by Golius; who<br>\
has consequently, after mentioning the meaning<br>\
“ infortunium,” added “ et Habena seu capistrum,<br>\
de quo in Conj. 1. ”]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] الفَاقِرَةُ signifies (assumed tropical:)  The resurrection. (TA.)<br>\
أَفْقَرُ [More, and most, poor or needy &amp;c.: said to<br>\
be formed irregularly from اِفْتَقَرَ, not from an unaugmented form of the verb; like مَا أَفْقَرَهُ]. (See<br>\
Ham pp. 573-4.)<br>\
مُفْقَرٌ: see فَقْرٌ.<br>\
مُفْقِرٌ, applied to a man, (O, TA,) Strong (O,<br>\
K, TA) in the vertebræ of the back; (TA;) and<br>\
thus ↓ مُفَقَّرٌ, applied to a camel; and [in like<br>\
manner] ↓ ذُوفُقْرَةٍ, so applied, strong to be ridden:<br>\
(O, TA:) and مُفْقِرٌ signifies also strong in the<br>\
back; applied to a colt: (TA:) and, thus applied,<br>\
that has attained to the time when he may be<br>\
ridden. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] one says, إِنَّهُ لَمُفْقِرٌ<br>\
لِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  Verily he is equal to this affair, possessing firmness of mind, or strength, or power, for<br>\
it; (ISh, O, L, K;) and لهذا العَزْمِ for this determination, or resolution; and لهذا القِرْنِ for this<br>\
adversary, or opponent. (L.) And ↓ رَجُلٌ مُفَقَّرٌ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A man sufficient for everything that he is ordered<br>\
to do; (O, K, TA;) as thought by reason of the<br>\
strength of his vertebræ. (TA.)<br>\
