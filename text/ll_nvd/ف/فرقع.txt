فَرْقَعَ الأَصَابِعَ i. q. نَقَّضَهَا, (S, * O, * K, [in<br>\
copies of the K written نَقَضَهَا, but correctly with<br>\
teshdeed, as is shown by what here follows,])<br>\
inf. n. فَرْقَعَةٌ i. q. تَنْقِيضٌ (S, O) and تَفْقِيعٌ, (TA,)<br>\
[He cracked the joints of his fingers;] i. e. he<br>\
pressed his fingers so that a sound was heard to<br>\
proceed from their joints: (TA:) the doing of<br>\
which is forbidden, (O, TA,) in prayer. (TA.<br>\
[See also 2 in art. فقع.]) And one says, سَمِعْتُ<br>\
فَرْقَعَةً لِرَجُلٍ and صَرْقَعَةً [I heard a cracking of the<br>\
joints of the fingers of a man]: both signify the<br>\
same. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فَرْقَعَةُ He twisted his (a<br>\
man&#39;s, K) neck. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  فَرْقَعَ [as an intrans. v.], (O, K, TA,) inf. n. as above, (TA,)<br>\
He ran vehemently, (O, K, TA,) going back, or<br>\
retreating: so in the Tekmileh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
فِرْقَاعٌ (as an inf. n. of which the verb is فَرْقَعَ, TK)<br>\
signifies The emitting of wind from the anus with<br>\
a sound: (O, K:) mentioned by IDrd as from<br>\
some one or more of the Arabs. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also<br>\
فَرْقَعَةٌ in what next follows.<br>\
Q. 2<br>\
تَفَرْقَعَتْ الأَصَابِعُ The fingers produced a<br>\
sound or sounds [by their joints&#39; being cracked];<br>\
(O;) quasi-pass. of 1 in the first of the senses<br>\
expl. above; (S, K;) as also ↓ اِفْرَنْقَعَت, (K,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. اِفْرِنْقَاعُ and [quasi-inf. n., being app.<br>\
the inf. n. in this case of فُرْقِعَت,] ↓ فَرْقَعَةٌ, (TA,)<br>\
[and this is app. what is meant by its being said<br>\
that] ↓ الاِفْرِنْقَاعُ is [syn. with] الفَرْقَعَةُ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Accord. to IDrd, تَفَرْقُعٌ signifies The sounding of<br>\
two things striking against each other. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And تفرقع الرَّجُلُ The man drew himself together,<br>\
or shrank; like تَقَرْعَفَ [which is mentioned in the<br>\
K in the same sense, as also تَقَرْفَعَ]. (L, TA.)<br>\

إِفْرَنْقَعَ see Q. 2, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  الاِفْرِنْقَاعُ also<br>\
signifies The withdrawing, or removing, and going<br>\
away, from a thing (عَنْ شَىْءٍ); (K;) and the<br>\
dispersing of itself, or becoming dispersed. (IAth,<br>\
TA.) اِفْرَنْقِعُوا عَنِّى, a phrase used by &#39;Eesà Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Omar, (S, O,) to people who had congregated<br>\
about him on an occasion of his having fallen<br>\
from his ass, (O,) means Withdraw ye, or remove,<br>\
(S,) or disperse yourselves, (O,) from me, (S,) and<br>\
go away. (S, O.) And &#39;Eesà Ibn-&#39;Omar is related to have read, [in the Kur xxxiv. 22,] حَتَّى<br>\
إِذَا افْرَنْقَعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ; meaning, كُشِفَ; [الفَزَعُ,<br>\
or the like, being understood;] but the common<br>\
reading is فُزِّعَ, q. v. (TA.)<br>\
الفُرْقَعَةَ The اِسْت [here app. meaning anus<br>\
(see 1)]; (Lth, IAar, K;) of the dial. of ElYemen: (O:) also called القُرْفُعَةُ. (TA.)<br>\
