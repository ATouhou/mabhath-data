فَضَّهُ, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,) aor. يَفُضُّ, (S, O,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. فَضٌّ, (S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K.) He<br>\
broke it; namely, the seal (A, Mgh, Msb, K) of<br>\
a letter; (A, K;) and any other thing; (TA:)<br>\
he broke it asunder, or into several pieces; he<br>\
dissundered it; (S, Mgh, O, K;) for instance, the<br>\
seal from a letter. (S, O.) فَصَّ الخَاتَمَ is also a<br>\
metonymical phrase, meaning (tropical:)  (??): (TA.)<br>\
[or rather, i. a.] فَضّ البَكَارَةَ (tropical:)  he destroyed the<br>\
virginity: the virginity being likened to a seal,<br>\
or this phrase is from فَضَضْتُ اللُّؤْلُؤَةَ I bored, or<br>\
perforated, the pearl. (Msb.) [See also 8.] You<br>\
say also, فَضَّ اللّٰهُ فَاهُ, (Msb, TA,) and, accord.<br>\
to IKtt, ↓ أَفَضَّهُ, which J disallows, (TA,) God<br>\
broke, or may God break, his teeth: (TA;) or<br>\
God scattered, or may God scatter, his teeth.<br>\
(Msb.) The phrase لَا يَفْضُضِ اللّٰهُ فَاكَ, (S, A.)<br>\
meaning May God not break thy teeth, (TA,)<br>\
occurs in a trad.: (S, A:) and J says. (TA,)<br>\
you should not say ↓ يُفْضِض; (S, TA; [but in<br>\
one copy of the S, I find يَفْضِض;]) though some<br>\
allow it: and some say that إِفْضَاء [evidently a<br>\
mistake for إِفْضَاض] means the falling out of the<br>\
teeth from above and below; but the former explanation is the more common. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He<br>\
separated it; dispersed it; scattered it; broke it<br>\
up; (S, A, Msb, TA;) namely, a thing; (Msb;)<br>\

(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  فَضَّ المَآءَ, [aor. and] inf. n. as above,<br>\
He poured out, or forth, the water; (TA;) and<br>\
so الدُّمُوعَ the tears. (Har p. 57.) [See also 8.]<br>\
-A2-  فَضَّ المَآءُ, [aor., accord. to rule, يَفِضُّ,] The<br>\
water flowed: (TA:) and الدُّمُوعُ ↓ انفضّت The<br>\
tears poured forth. (Har p. 57.)<br>\

-b2-  افضّ العَطَآءَ He<br>\
made the gift large. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَفَضَّ3َ see 7.<br>\
-A2-  تَفَضَّيْتُ from الفِضَّةُ, for تَفَضَّضْتُ,<br>\
has been mentioned by Sb; but ISd says, I know<br>\
not what he meant thereby; whether I took for<br>\
myself, or acquired, فِضَّة, [i. e. silver], or I made<br>\
use of it. (TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انفضّ It broke; or became broken; (S,<br>\
Mgh;) said of a seal, (Mgh,) or thing. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
انفضّ مِمَّا صُنِعَ بِابْنِ عَفَّانَ, occurring in a trad.,<br>\
means His connections became cut, or sundered,<br>\
[so that he became clear] from what was done to<br>\
[&#39;Othmán] Ibn-&#39;Affán, through grief and regret:<br>\
(O, TA:) but accord. to one relation, the verb is<br>\
[انقضّ,] with ق. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  انفضّ also signifies<br>\
It became separated, dispersed, scattered, or<br>\
broken up; or it separated, dispersed, or scattered,<br>\
itself, or it broke up; (S, Mgh, O, Msb;) said<br>\
of a thing, (Msb,) and of a party of men; (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb;) as also ↓ تفضّض, said of a<br>\
thing, (S,) and of a party of men. (TA.) One<br>\

-b3-<br>\
افتضّتِ said of a woman, She broke [i. e. ended]<br>\
her عِدَّة, (O, K, TA,) meaning a widow&#39;s عدّة<br>\
[during which she may not marry again, nor use<br>\
perfumes &amp;c., and] which is a period of four<br>\
months and ten nights, but was before the<br>\
Prophet&#39;s time a year: (TA:) this she did by<br>\
touching perfume, or by some other act, (K, TA,)<br>\
such as paring the nail, or plucking out the hair<br>\
from the face: (TA:) or she rubbed her body<br>\
with [or against] a beast, (K, TA,) i. e. an ass,<br>\
or a sheep or goat, (O in art. حفش,) thereby to<br>\
quit the state of the عدّة: or it was customary<br>\
with them for her to wipe her قُبُل with a bird,<br>\
and to throw it away; in consequence of which<br>\
it hardly ever, or never, lived: (K, TA:) she<br>\
used to enter a حِفْش [or small tent], and wear<br>\
the worst of her clothing until a year passed,<br>\
when a beast or bird was brought to her, and by<br>\
means thereof she broke her عدّة; then she went<br>\
forth, and a بَعْرَة [or piece of camel&#39;s or similar<br>\
dung] was given to her, and she threw it: (TA:<br>\
[see 1 in art. بعر:]) she used not to wash herself,<br>\
nor to touch water, nor to pare a nail, nor to<br>\
pluck out hair from her face; then she would go<br>\
forth, after the year, with the foulest aspect, and<br>\
break her عدّة by means of a bird, wiping her قُبُل<br>\
with it, and throwing it away. (O, TA.) The<br>\
verb, thus used, occurs in a trad., but, as some<br>\
relate it, with ق and ب [i. e. saying تَقْبِضُ instead of تَفْتَضُّ]; and Az mentions that EshSháfi&#39;ee related this trad. [in like manner] pronouncing the word with ق and ض, from القبض.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

and capable of being restored to a sound state if<br>\

as Zj says, originally of silver, yet transparent, so<br>\
