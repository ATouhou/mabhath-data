فَرِ3َ, inf. n. فِرَارً (T, S, M, K, &amp;c.) and<br>\
فَرٌ (M, K) and مَفَرٌ (S, M, K) and مَفِرٌ, (K,) or<br>\
the last is a n. of place [and of time], (S, M,) He<br>\
(a man, T) fled: (T, S:) or he turned away or<br>\
aside, to elude, and fled, (M, K, TA,) from a<br>\
thing that he feared. (TA.) أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ [in the Kur<br>\
lxxv. 10] means Whither is the [fleeing or] turning<br>\
away &amp;c.? (M, TA:) or it may mean when is the<br>\
time thereof? (TA:) and اين المَفِرُّ, another reading,<br>\
where is the place of fleeing &amp;c.? (I&#39;Ab, Zj, S, M,<br>\
TA,) as also المِفَرُّ, (Zj, K, TA,) which is an instrumental noun used as a noun of place: (K, TA:) but<br>\
the first is the common reading. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  فَرَّ<br>\
مِنْ عَدُوِهِ, aor. as above, inf. n. فَرٌّ, He wheeled<br>\
about widely from his enemy, to turn again.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فَرَّ إِلَى الشَّىْءِ He went, or betook<br>\
himself, to the thing. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And [hence]<br>\
فَرَّتْ يَدُهُ His arm, or hand, fell off; like طَرَّتْ<br>\
and تَرَّتْ. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  فَرَّ الفَرَسَ, (S, O,) or الدَّابَّةَ,<br>\
(M, K,) aor.<br>\
فَرُ3َ, (S, M, O,) i. e. with damm, (O,)<br>\
[in copies of the K<br>\
فَرِ3َ, but afterwards in those<br>\
copies<br>\
فَرُ3َ, which is the regular and correct form,]<br>\
inf. n. فَرٌّ (S, M, O, K) and فُرَارٌ and فِرَارٌ and فَرَارٌ,<br>\
(K,) or فُرَارٌ is a simple subst., and فِرَارٌ is an inf. n.,<br>\
(Meyd, in explanation of the prov. which here<br>\
follows,) He looked at, or examined, the teeth of<br>\
the horse, (S, O,) or he exposed to view the teeth<br>\
of the beast that he might see what was its age.<br>\
(M, K.) Hence, (TA,)<br>\
إِنَّ الجَوَادَ عَيْنُهُ فُرَارُهُ<br>\
(S, M, * Meyd, K, *) and فِرَارُهُ, (M, Meyd, K,)<br>\
and فَرَارُهُ, (S, K,) sometimes thus pronounced<br>\
with fet-h, (S,) (tropical:)  [Verily the fleet and excellent<br>\
horse, his aspect (see عَيْنٌ) is (equivalent to) the<br>\
examination of his teeth, i. e. he is known by his<br>\
aspect], is a prov., applied to him whose external<br>\
state indicates his internal qualities; (Meyd, O,<br>\
K;) meaning that one knows his excellence from<br>\
his عَيْن [i. e. aspect] like as one knows the age<br>\
of a beast by examining his teeth; (TA;) his<br>\
external appearance rendering it needless for thee<br>\
to test him, (S, Meyd, O, K,) and to examine<br>\
(أَنْ تَفُرَّ) his teeth: (S, O, K:) and [with the<br>\
same meaning] one says, فَرُّ الجَوَادِ عَيْنُهُ: (A, TA:)<br>\
and [in like manner] الخَبِيثُ عَينُهُ فُرِاَرُهُ [The bad,<br>\
his aspect &amp;c.]; (Meyd, O, TA;) i. e. thou knowest his badness by his عَيْن when thou seest him.<br>\
(TA.) And one says also, فَرَرْتُ فَمَ الفَرَسِ I<br>\
opened the mouth of the horse that I might know<br>\
his age. (Har p. 28.) And فَرَّ عَنْ أَسْنَانِ الدَّابَّةِ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
فَرِ3َ, He examined the teeth of the beast. (Har<br>\
p. 233.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence the saying of El-Hajjáj, فُرِرْتُ<br>\
عَنْ ذَكَآءٍ, expl. in art. ذكو.] And [hence also]<br>\
one says, فَرَّهُ عَنْ أَشْيَآءِ (tropical:)  He examined him respecting things (O, * TA.) And فَرَّ الأَمْرَ, (M, TA,)<br>\
and فَرَّ عَنِ الأَمْرِ, (S, M, O, K, TA,) (tropical:)  He examined, looked into, scrutinized, or investigated, the<br>\
affair; searched into it; inquired, or sought information, respecting it. (S, M, O, K, TA.) And<br>\
فَرَّ فُلَانٌ عَمَّا فِى نَفْسِى (tropical:)  Such a one interrogated me<br>\
in order that he might know, from what I should<br>\
say, what was in my mind. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فُرَّ الأَمْرُ<br>\
جَذَعًا (assumed tropical:)  The thing returned to its first state; it<br>\
recommenced. (M, O, K.) And فُرَّ الأَمْرَ جَذَعًا<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Commence thou the affair from the first thereof.<br>\
(M, in the TT. [But the MS. has in this case,<br>\
as in that here immediately preceding, الامرُ: the<br>\
right reading is evidently الامرَ; as in a similar<br>\
phrase voce جَذَعٌ, q. v.])<br>\
-A3-  فَرَّ, aor. يَفِرُّ or يَفَرُّ,<br>\
(accord. to different copies of the T,) He became<br>\
intelligent after being weak [in mind]. (IAar, T,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
فَارَرْتُهُ, inf. n. مُفَارَّةٌ, (tropical:)  I investigated his state,<br>\
or condition, he investigating mine. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
افرّهُ He, or it, made him to flee; (S, O;)<br>\
or made him to turn away or aside, for the purpose of eluding, and to flee: (M, K:) or (O) he<br>\
did to him a deed that made him to flee; (Fr, AO,<br>\
T, M, O, K;) as also افرّبِهِ. (TA.) It is related<br>\
in a trad. that the Prophet said to &#39;Adee the son<br>\
of Hátim, مَا يُفِرُّكَ عَنِ الإِسْلَامِ إِلّا أَنْ يُقَالَ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا<br>\
اللّٰهُ (T, M, O, TA) i. e. Nothing induces thee to<br>\
flee from El-Islám except the saying “ There is<br>\
no deity but God: ” many of the relaters say<br>\
يَفُرُّكَ; but Az says that the former is the right.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the saying, افرّاللّٰهُ يَدَهُ God<br>\
made, or may God make, his arm, or hand, to<br>\
fall off; like أَطَرَّهَا and أَتَرَّهَا. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
أَفْرَرْتُ رَأْسَهُ I split, or clave, his head, with a<br>\
sword; like أَفْرَيْتُهُ. (Yz, T, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  أَفَرَّتْ<br>\
لِلْإِثْنَآءِ, said of camels, (S, M, O, K,) and of<br>\
horses, (M, K,) They shed their milk-teeth and<br>\
had others come forth. (S, M, O, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَفَرَّرَ بِى i. q. ضَحِكَ [He laughed at me,<br>\
derided me, or ridiculed me]; (K, TA;) mentioned by Sgh. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تفارّوا They fled, one from another. (S,<br>\
O, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
افترّ He laughed in a beautiful manner, (M,<br>\
K,) beyond what is termed اِنْكِلَال [inf. n. of اِنْكَلَّ,<br>\
q. v.]. (M.) One says, افترَّ ضَاحِكًا He showed his<br>\
teeth laughing; (S;) as also افتر عَنْ ثَغْرِهِ. (T.) It<br>\
is said of the Prophet, الغَمَامِ وَ يَفْتَرُّ عَنْ مِثْلِ حَبِّ<br>\
meaning And he used to smile so as to show teeth<br>\
the like of hail-stones, without a reiterated, or a<br>\
loud, laughing. (T.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) افترّ البَرْقُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The lightning glistened. (M, K.) And hence<br>\
the saying, الصَّرْفَهُ نَابُ الدَّهْرِ الَّذِى يَفْتَرُّ عَنْهُ [Es-<br>\
Sarfeh is the dog-tooth of time, or fortune, which<br>\
it shows smiling]: for when Es-Sarfeh [which is<br>\
the Twelfth Mansion of the Moon] rises, [but it<br>\
should be, when it sets, aurorally, for it so set, in<br>\
Central Arabia, about the commencement of the<br>\
era of the Flight, on the 9th of March, O. S.,]<br>\
the blossoms come forth and the herbage attains<br>\
its full height. (M, L. [See more in art. صرف.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  See also فُرٌّ.<br>\
-A2-  Also He snuffed up a thing<br>\
into his nose. (M, K.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
فَرْفَرَهُ, (S, M, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. فَرْفَارٌ,<br>\
(M,) or فِرْفَارٌ, (TA,) He put in a state of motion,<br>\
commotion, or agitation; shook; or shook about;<br>\
(S, M, K;) it, (S, K,) or him. (M.) One says<br>\
of a horse, يُفَرْفِرُ اللِّجَامَ فِى فِيهِ He puts in a state<br>\
of motion, &amp;c., the bit in his mouth. (M. [See<br>\
also an explanation of the verb as intrans., in<br>\
what follows.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  He broke it, i. e. a thing.<br>\
(M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He cut it. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He clave, split,<br>\
slit, rent, or tore, it. (TA.) [Thus] فَرْفَرَ signifies<br>\
He rent, or tore, [skins such as are termed] زِقَاق<br>\
[pl. of زِقٌّ], and other things; (O, K, TA;) and<br>\
slit, or rent, them much. (TA. [In two copies<br>\
of the T, instead of الزِّقَاقَ وَغَيْرَهَا, the reading in<br>\
the O and K and TA, I find الرُقاقَ وغيره.]) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
[He mangled it.] One says, الذِّئْبُ يُفَرْفِرُ الشَّاةَ<br>\
The wolf mangles the sheep, or goat. (O, * TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  And, (O, K, TA,) hence, (O,) inf. n. فَرْفَرَةٌ,<br>\
(TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He defamed him, and mangled his reputation. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And (assumed tropical:)  He discommended<br>\
it, [as though] mangling it with discommendation:<br>\
the verb occurs in this sense in a trad., having<br>\
for its object الدُّنْيَا [meaning the enjoyments, or<br>\
good, of the present world]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Also, (inf. n.<br>\
فَرْفَرَةٌ, TA,) He called or cried, or called out or<br>\
cried out, to him. (M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  فَرْفَرَ as intrans.,<br>\
He (a camel) put his body in a state of commotion, or agitation. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He (a horse)<br>\
struck his teeth with the فأْس [q. v.] of his bit,<br>\
and moved about his head. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He<br>\
hastened, or sped, and went with short steps. (M,<br>\
O, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He was light, and unsteady, (S, * M, *<br>\
O, * K, TA,) in mind; (TA;) inf. n. فَرْفَرَةٌ. (S,<br>\
M, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  He hastened, or was hasty, with<br>\
foolishness, or stupidity. (IAar, T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And<br>\
He confounded, or confused, and was profuse, فِى<br>\
كَلَامِهِ [in his speaking, or talking, or his speech,<br>\
or talk]. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And [app. He talked;<br>\
for] الفَرْفَرَةٌ signifies الكَلَامُ [which is often used as<br>\
a quasi-inf. n. of كلّم]. (M.)<br>\
-A3-  فَرْفَرَ also signifies He made the kind of vehicle called فَرْفَار.<br>\
(T, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He kindled [a fire] with [wood<br>\
of] the species of tree called فَرفَار. (T, K.)<br>\
فَرٌّ: see فَارٌّ, in two places.<br>\
فُرٌّ [The best, or choice, of men &amp;c.]. One says,<br>\
هُوَ فُرٌّ قَوْمِهِ, (O,) or فُرٌّ القَوْمِ, (K,) and ↓ فُرَّتُهُمْ, (O,<br>\
K,) He is of the best, or choice, of his people, or<br>\
of the people, (O, K,) and of the chief persons<br>\
thereof, (O, K, *) who show him smiling (اَلَّذِينَ<br>\
عَنْهُ ↓ يَفْتَرُّونَ, perhaps better rendered who withdraw from him so as to render him conspicuous):<br>\
(O, K:) or قَوْمِهِ ↓ هُوَفُرَّةٌ he is the best, or choice,<br>\
of his people: (T:) and مَالِى ↓ هٰذَا فُرَّةٌ, (T,) or<br>\
مَالِهِ, (O,) this is the best, or choice, of my, or his,<br>\
property, or camels &amp;c. (T, O.)<br>\
فُرَّةٌ and ↓ أُفُرَّةٌ and ↓ أَفُرَّةٌ The beginning, or first<br>\
part, of the heat: (T, S, M, O, K:) or they signify, (T, S, M,) or signify also, (O, K,) the<br>\
vehemence thereof: (S, M, O, K:) but [Az says,]<br>\
the second and third are in my opinion from أَفَرَ,<br>\
the أ being the first radical letter: and Ks states<br>\
that some change the أ into ع, saying عُفُرَّة and<br>\
عَفُرَّة. (T.) شَرٍّمِنْ فُلَانٍ ↓ مَا زَالَ فُلَانٌ فِى أُفُرَّةٍ is<br>\
a saying mentioned by Lth, (T, TA,) meaning<br>\
[Such a one ceased not to be] in a vehement state<br>\
of evil or mischief [proceeding from such a one].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Confusion and difficulty. (M, K.)<br>\
One says, وَقَعَ القَوْمُ فِى فُرَّةٍ and ↓ أُفُرَّةٍ and ↓ أَفُرَّةٍ<br>\
The people, or party, fell into confusion and difficulty. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also the next preceding paragraph, in three places.<br>\
فِرَّةٌ A smiling: [or rather a manner of smiling:]<br>\
one says, إنَّها لَحَسَنَةُ الفِرَّةِ [Verily she is beautiful<br>\
in respect of the manner of smiling]. (TA.)<br>\
فُرُرٌ: see فُرَارٌ.<br>\
فُرَرَةٌ: see فَارٌّ.<br>\
فُرَارٌ and ↓ فَريرٌ The young one of the ewe, and<br>\
of the she-goat, (M, K,) and of the cow, (M,) or<br>\
of the wild cow, (A &#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, O, K,) as<br>\
also, in this last sense, (O, K,) and in the first<br>\
and second senses, (K,) ↓ فُرْفُرٌ and ↓ فُرْفُورٌ (O, K)<br>\
and ↓ فَرُورٌ and ↓ فُرَافِرٌ: (K:) or they [app. referring to all the foregoing words] signify lambs:<br>\
(K: [but see what follows:]) the female is<br>\
termed فُرَارَةٌ: (M:) and فُرَارٌ is pl. also; (T, M,<br>\
K;) i. e. it is applied to a pl. number as well as<br>\
to one; (TA;) it is said to be pl. of ↓ فَرِيرٌ; (T,<br>\
S, M, O;) and is of a rare form of pl.; (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
S, O, K; *) and it signifies the small in body of<br>\
the young ones of the goat-kind; (M;) or ↓ فَرِيرٌ,<br>\
as some say, signifies thus: (TA: [but this I<br>\
think doubtful:]) this last word is said by IAar<br>\
to signify the young one of the wild animal, of the<br>\
gazelle and of the bovine kind and the like; and in<br>\
one instance he says that it signifies lambs: (M:)<br>\
and, (T, A,) as Aboo-l-&#39;Abbás [i. e. Th] states on<br>\
the authority of IAar, (T,) فُرَارٌ (T, M) and فُرَارَةٌ<br>\
(T) and ↓ فَرِيرٌ (M) and ↓ فُرُرٌ and ↓ فُرْفُورٌ and ↓ فُرَافِرٌ<br>\
(T, M) signify the lamb when it is weaned, (T,<br>\
M,) and has become what is termed جَفْرٌ [q. v.],<br>\
and obtained plenty of herbage, (M,) and has<br>\
become fat: (T, M:) accord. to Ibn-&#39;Abbád, (O,)<br>\
the last two signify a lamb (حَمَل, O, TA, in the<br>\
K جَمَل, a mistranscription, TA) when it eats,<br>\
and chews the cud: (O, K: [see also فُرْفُورٌ below:])<br>\
and [it is also said that] فُرَارٌ signifies great بَهْم<br>\
[app. as meaning lambs or kids], and one thereof<br>\
is termed ↓ فُرْفُورٌ. (TA.) It is said in a prov.<br>\
نَزْوُ الفُرَارِ اسْتَجْهَلَ الفُرَارَا<br>\
[The leaping of the wild calf, or with equal propriety الفرار may be here rendered the kid, excited<br>\
to lightness the  other wild calf, or kid]: (T, S, O,<br>\
K:) A &#39;Obeyd says, on the authority of El-Mu-<br>\
ärrij, [and so says Meyd, and the same is implied<br>\
in the S and O,] that الفرار here means the young<br>\
one of the wild cow: (T:) i. e., when the فرار<br>\
attains to youthful vigour it takes to leaping,<br>\
and when another sees it [do so] it leaps in like<br>\
manner: (T, S, K:) the prov. is used in relation<br>\
to him of whose companionship one should be<br>\
cautious; meaning, if thou become his companion<br>\
thou wilt do as he does: (T, O, K:) some relate<br>\
it otherwise, saying نَزْوَ, meaning نَزَا نَزْوَ الفُرَارِ.<br>\
(O.) [See also a similar prov. in art. سفه, conj. 5.]<br>\
فَرُرٌ: see فَارٌّ. It is applied to a woman as<br>\
meaning Wont to flee from that which induces<br>\
doubt, or suspicion, or evil opinion. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
فَرِيرٌ: see فُرَارٌ, in four places.<br>\
-A2-  Also The<br>\
place of the محَسَّة [thus in a copy of the M (app.<br>\
مِحَسَّة i. e. currycomb, as though meaning the<br>\
part that is currycombed), in the K of the مجَسَّة<br>\
(i. e. مَجَسَّة, q. v.), and in the O of the مجمّ,<br>\
which last I think to be a mistranscription,] of the<br>\
مَعْرَفَة [or part, or flesh, upon which grows the<br>\
mane] of the horse: (M, O, K:) or the base<br>\
(أَصْل) of the مَعْرَفَة of the horse. (T; and accord.<br>\
to the TA, mentioned by Sgh, and there said to<br>\
be tropical.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The mouth: (O, K, TA:)<br>\
mentioned by Z in a manner indicating that it is<br>\
of the horse or the like. (TA.)<br>\
فَرُورَةٌ: see فَارٌ.<br>\
كَتِيبَةٌ فُرَّى [A military force, or troop, &amp;c.,]<br>\
defeated: (T, O, K:) as also فُلَّى. (T.)<br>\
فَرَّآءُ, applied to a woman, i. q. غَرَّآءُ, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
meaning Beautiful in the front teeth. (TA.)<br>\
فَرَّارٌ: see فَارٌّ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] Quicksilver; so called<br>\
because flowing quickly, and not remaining in a<br>\
place: thus says Esh-Shereeshee. (Har p. 139.)<br>\
فُرَّيْرَةٌ, in the dim. form, with tesh-deed, [A spinning-top;] a thing with which children play. (TA.)<br>\

or turning away or aside, to elude, and fleeing:<br>\
the third, fifth, and sixth, fleeing, &amp;c., much: and<br>\
the fourth, fleeing, &amp;c., very much:] but ↓ فَرٌّ is<br>\
applied to one and to two and to more, and to a<br>\
female; (S, O;) it has no dual nor pl. [nor fem.<br>\
form]; (T;) the sing. [and dual] and pl. [and<br>\
mase. and fem.] are alike; (M;) as it is an inf. n.<br>\
used as an epithet; (M, O;) and it may be a<br>\
pl. [or rather a quasi-pl. n.] of فَارٌّ, (S, M, O,)<br>\
like as رَكْبٌ is of رَاكِبٌ, (S, O,) and صَحْبٌ of<br>\
صَاحِبٌ, (S, O, K, *) or شَرْبٌ of شَارِبٌ: (M:) it is<br>\
related in the trad. respecting the Flight that<br>\
Surákah Ibn-Málik, when he saw the Prophet<br>\
and Aboo-Bekr fleeing to El-Medeeneh, and they<br>\
passed by him, said, هٰذَانِ فَرٌّ قُرَيشٍ أَفَلَا أَرُدُّ عَلَى<br>\
قُرَيْشٍ فَرَّهَا, (T, * S, * O, * TA,) meaning [These<br>\

[q. v.]; its leaves are like those of the almondtree; it has blossoms like the red rose; (O, TA;)<br>\
and it becomes thick so that great [bowls such as<br>\
are termed] عِسَاس, and أَقْدَاح, are turned from<br>\
it: (O:) when its tree becomes old, its wood becomes black like ebony: (O, TA:) it is a hard<br>\
wood, that blunts iron; and the bowls thereof are<br>\
thin and light, and of pleasant odour: small<br>\
saddles, called مَخَاصِر, pl. of مِخْصَرَةٌ, for excellent<br>\
she-camels, were also made of it, and the curved<br>\
pieces of wood (أَحْنَآء) thereof amounted [in price]<br>\

has become what is termed جَفْرٌ].) ―<br>\

AHát, Et-Táïfee says that ↓ الفُرْفُرُ, of which the<br>\
pl. is الفَرَافِرُ, signifies the نَقَاقِير; thus he says,<br>\
[using the pl.,] not the نُقَّار [or نَقَّار? (see عُصْفُورٌ)];<br>\
and he adds that sometimes it is said that the<br>\
فُرْفُور is the صِرّ [q. v.]; and some say ↓ الفِرْفِرُ,<br>\

chasteness: (O:) [accord. to Ed-Demeeree, as<br>\
stated by Freytag, فُرْفُرٌ is the name of a small<br>\
aquatic bird like the dove or pigeon: SM says,<br>\
app. relying upon the correctness of a modern<br>\
application of the word,] I have seen the فُرْفُور in<br>\
