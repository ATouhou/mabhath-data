فَرُهَ, aor.<br>\
فَرُهَ, (S, K,) inf. n. فَرَاهَةٌ and فَرَاهِيَةٌ<br>\
(K) [and app. also فُرُوهَةٌ, expl. below as a simple<br>\
subst.], He was, or became, skilled, or skilful. (S,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فَرُهَ and فَرَهَ, aor. of each<br>\
فَرُهَ, [inf. n.<br>\
app. فُرُوهَةٌ and فَرَاهَةٌ and فَرَاهِيَةٌ, expl. below as<br>\
simple substs.,] said of a horse or similar beast,<br>\
&amp;c., He was, or became, brisk, lively, sprightly,<br>\
active, agile, or light. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And فَرُهَ, inf. n.<br>\
فَرَاهَةٌ, (of which see an explanation below,) probably signifies He was, or became, beautiful,<br>\
comely, pretty, or elegant; like صَبُحَ, inf. n.<br>\
صَبَاحَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  And فَرِهَ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
فَرَهَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
فَرَهٌ, (TK,) He exulted, or rejoiced above measure;<br>\
or he exulted greatly, and behaved insolently and<br>\
unthankfully, or ungratefully: (S, K:) the ه in<br>\
this verb, accord. to Fr, is substituted for the ح<br>\
in فَرِحَ, which has this meaning. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
فَرَّهَ see what next follows.<br>\
4<br>\
أَفْرَهَت She (a camel) brought forth [young<br>\
ones such as are termed] فُرْهٌ (S) or فُرَّهٌ (K) [i. e.<br>\
such as were brisk, lively, sprightly, active, agile,<br>\
or light]; as also ↓ فرّهت, inf. n. تَفْرِيهٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And She (a woman) brought forth beautiful<br>\
children. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And افره He (a man) took<br>\
for himself a غُلَام [i. e. youth, young man, or<br>\
male slave,] such as is termed فَارِهٌ (IAar, K)<br>\
meaning beautiful, or comely, of countenance.<br>\
(IAar, TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
هُوَ يَسْتَفْرِهُ الأَفْرَاسَ means يَسْتَكْرِمُهَا [i. e. He<br>\
seeks the horses, or mares, that are of generous<br>\
race]: (aK, TA:) and the like is said in the A,<br>\
but with الدَّوَابَّ in the place of الافراس. (TA.)<br>\
فَرِهٌ [part. n. of فَرِهَ, meaning Exulting, or rejoicing above measure; &amp;c.]. In the Kur xxvi.<br>\
149, some read فَرِهِينَ, from فَرِهَ, signifying as<br>\
expl. above: others reading فَارِهِينَ, which is<br>\
from فَرُهَ: (S, TA:) ―<br>\
-b2-  but فَرِهٌ is also syn. with<br>\
فَارِهٌ, as an epithet applied to a youth, or young<br>\
man, or male slave; and thus the reading of<br>\
فَرِهِينَ in the Kur has been expl. as meaning<br>\
Possessing skill. (TA.)<br>\
فُرَاهٌ i. q. فُرَاتٌ, as an epithet applied to water,<br>\
signifying Sweet, &amp;c.: both are chaste forms,<br>\
and well known, like تَابُوهٌ and تَابُوتٌ: so in the<br>\
Towsheeh. (MF and TA in art. فرت.)<br>\
فَرَاهَةٌ [mentioned in the first paragraph as an<br>\
inf. n. is also expl. as a simple subst.]: see فُرُوهَةٌ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also Beauty, or comeliness. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
فُرُوهَةٌ [app. an inf. n., but mentioned as a<br>\
simple subst., meaning] Skilfulness. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And فُرُوهَهٌ and ↓ فَرَاهَةٌ and ↓ فَرَاهِيَةٌ denote a<br>\
quality of a hackney and of a mule and of an<br>\
ass, (S,) or of a horse, or similar beast, &amp;c.,<br>\
(Msb,) all signifying Briskness, liveliness, sprightliness, activity, agility, or lightness. (Msb, TA. *)<br>\
فَرَاهِيَةٌ [mentioned in the first paragraph as an<br>\
inf. n.]: see what next precedes.<br>\
فَارِهٌ Skilful, or possessing skill; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
part. n. of فَرُهَ, irregularly formed, for by rule it<br>\
should be فَرِيهٌ: (S:) accord. to Z, it is applied<br>\
to a man; and also, without ة, to a قَيْنَة [i. e.<br>\
female slave, or slave-songstress]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And it is applied as an epithet to a hackney,<br>\
(Az, S, Msb,) and a mule, (S,) and an ass, (Az,<br>\
S, Msb,) or to a horse, or similar beast, (Az,)<br>\
meaning Brisk, lively, sprightly, active, agile, or<br>\
light; (Az, * Msb;) sharp; strong; that goes, or<br>\
journeys, much; a great goer: (Az, TA:) it is<br>\
not applied to a فَرَس, (Az, S,) i. e. to an Arabian<br>\
horse; (Az, Msb;) such being termed جَوَادٌ, (Az,<br>\
S, Msb,) and رَائِعٌ: (S:) &#39;Adee Ibn-Zeyd has<br>\
applied it to the latter; but As has charged him<br>\
with error in so doing; saying that he possessed<br>\
not knowledge of horses: (S:) the pl. is فُرْهٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) like بُزْلٌ and حُولٌ pls. of بَازِلٌ and حَائِلٌ,<br>\
(S,) or فُرُهٌ, like كُتُبٌ, (K,) and فَرَهَةٌ, with two<br>\
fet-hahs, (Msb,) or فُرْهَةٌ, (S, K,) but this is held<br>\
by Sb to be a quasi-pl. n., (ISd, TA,) and فُرَّهٌ,<br>\
like رُكَّعٌ, and فُرَّهَةٌ, like سُكَّرَةٌ, (K,) as in the A,<br>\
but MF says that no pl. of this measure is known.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, applied to a غُلَام [i. e. youth,<br>\
young man, or male slave], Beautiful, or comely,<br>\
of countenance. (IAar, TA.) And [the fem.]<br>\
فَارِهَةٌ signifies A beautiful, or comely, girl, or<br>\
young woman: (K:) [and] so ↓ فَرْهَآءُ, [of which<br>\
the masc. is أَفْرَهُ, and] of which the pl. is فُرْهٌ;<br>\
but Az says, I do not think that they use this<br>\
word in relation to girls, or young women, though<br>\
they may apply it peculiarly to female slaves like<br>\
as they apply فَارِهٌ and فَارِهَةٌ peculiarly to hackneys<br>\
and mules and jades, exclusively of Arabian<br>\
horses. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And فَارِهَةٌ is also syn. with<br>\
فَتِيَّةٌ [i. e. A youthful females, or one in the prime<br>\
of life]: (thus accord. to several copies of the K<br>\
and accord. to the TA:) or قَيْنَةٌ [i. e. a female<br>\
slave, or a slave-songstress: see the first sentence<br>\
of this paragraph]. (Thus in the CK.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
it signifies also [A woman] who eats vehemently:<br>\
(K:) and فَارِهٌ applied to man, A vehement eater.<br>\
(IAar, TA.)<br>\
أَفْرَهُ: see its fem., فَرْهَآءُ, in the next preceding<br>\
paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-  فُلَانٌ أَفْرَهُ مِنْ فُلَانٍ means Such a<br>\
one is more beautiful, or comely, than such a one.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
مُفْرِهٌ and مُفْرِهَةٌ (S, K) and مُفَرِّهَةٌ (S) are epithets<br>\
applied to a she-camel, meaning Bringing forth<br>\
[young ones such as are termed] فُرْهٌ (S) or فُرَّهٌ.<br>\
(K.) [See 4.]<br>\
