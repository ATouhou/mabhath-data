ف<br>\
The twentieth letter of the alphabet: called فَآءٌ<br>\
[and فَا]. (TA.) It is one of the letters termed<br>\
مَهْمُوسَة [or non-vocal, i. e. pronounced with the<br>\
breath only, without the voice], and of those<br>\
termed شَفَوِيَّة [or labial]: (TA:) it is a radical<br>\
letter, and not augmentative: (TA in باب الالف<br>\
الليّنة:) sometimes it is substituted for ث; thus<br>\
in the conjunction ثُمَّ, as in the saying جَآءَ زَيْدٌ فُمَّ<br>\
عَمْرٌو [“ Zeyd came, then &#39;Amr ”]; and in الثُّومُ,<br>\
“ the well-known herb so called [?],” for which they<br>\
say الفُومُ; and in الجَدَثُ, “the grave,” or<br>\
“ sepulchre,” for which they say الجَدَفُ, but<br>\
using for the pl. أَجْدَاثٌ, and not أَجْدَافٌ, accord.<br>\
to IJ, (MF, TA,) [unless, app., by poetic<br>\
license, for] the latter pl. is used by Ru-beh. (R<br>\
and TA in art. جدف.)<br>\
-A2-  فَ is a particle having<br>\
no government: (Mughnee, * K, * TA:) or it<br>\
governs a mansoob aor.; as in the saying, مَا<br>\
تَأْتِينَا فَتُحَدِّثَنَا [Thou dost not come to us, that thou<br>\
mayest talk to us]; (Mughnee, K, TA;) accord.<br>\
to some of the Koofees; (Mughnee;) but the<br>\
truth is, that the aor. is here mansoob by أَنْ,<br>\
meant to be understood, (Mughnee, TA,) as is<br>\
said by MF, and the like is said by J, (TA,)<br>\
though the أَنْ in this case is necessarily suppressed: (I&#39;Ak p. 295:) and it is said (Mughnee,<br>\
K, TA) by Mbr (Mughnee) to govern the gen.<br>\
case in the saying [of Imra-el-Keys],<br>\
فَمِثْلِكِ حُبْلَى قَدْ طَرَقْتُ وَمُرْضِعٍ<br>\
[Many a one like thee, even such as was pregnant, have I visited by night, and such as was<br>\
suckling]; but the truth is, that what here<br>\
governs the gen. case is رُبَّ, meant to be understood; (Mughnee, TA;) like as it often is in the<br>\
case of وَ, as is said in the Lubáb. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It<br>\
occurs used in three manners; in one whereof it<br>\
is an adjunctive to an antecedent, and denotes<br>\
three things: ―<br>\
-b3-  one of these is order; and this<br>\
is of two sorts; relating to the meaning, as in<br>\
قَامَ زَيْدٌ فَعَمْرٌو [Zeyd came, and after him &#39;Amr];<br>\
and relating to a verbal statement, which is an<br>\
adjoining of an explicit clause to an implicit<br>\
antecedent, as in the saying [in the Kur ii. 34]<br>\
فَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَانُ عَنْهَا فَأَخْرَجَهُمَا مِمَّا كَانَا فِيهِ [And<br>\
the Devil caused them both to slip, or fall, from<br>\
it (i. e. from Paradise), and ejected them from<br>\
that state of enjoyment in which they were]:<br>\
(Mughnee, K: *) ―<br>\
-b4-  the second thing that it<br>\
denotes when used as an adjunctive to an antecedent is proximate sequence, and this is in<br>\
everything [i. e. in every case] according to the<br>\
estimate thereof; (Mughnee, K; *) [meaning,<br>\
according to the relative, or comparative, estimate of the time implied; for, as is said in an<br>\
explanation of the words thus rendered, in a<br>\
marginal note in my copy of the Mughnee, “the<br>\
long period is sometimes esteemed short by comparison; ” or it may be defined as a particle denoting sequence in a case in which is an uninterrupted connection between two events;] one says<br>\
تَزَوَّجَ فُلَانٌ فَوُلِدَ لَهُ [Such a one took a wife, and,<br>\
in uninterrupted connection with his doing so, a<br>\
child was born to him,] when there did not intervene between the two events aught save the<br>\
period of gestation, (Mughnee, K, *) and so if it<br>\
were a period protracted [beyond the usual<br>\
length]; and you say دَخَلْتُ البَصْرَةَ فَبَغْدَادَ [I<br>\
entered El-Basrah, and, in uninterrupted connection with my doing so, Baghdád,] when you<br>\
did not stay in El-Basrah nor between the two<br>\
towns: and this sequence is not necessarily implied by the ف that denotes causality; as is<br>\
shown by the correctness of one&#39;s saying إِنْ<br>\
يُسْلِمْ فَهُوَ يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ [If he become a Muslim,<br>\
he will consequently enter Paradise]; the delay<br>\
between the two events [by death &amp;c.] being well<br>\
known: (Mughnee:) ―<br>\
-b5-  [or, accord. to J,] the<br>\
adjunctive ف occurs in three cases, in the first of<br>\
which it denotes order and proximate sequence<br>\
with association; you say, ضَرَبْتُ زَيْدًا فَعَمْرًا [I<br>\
beat Zeyd, and next &#39;Amr]: (S: [the second and<br>\
third of these cases will be mentioned in the<br>\
course of this art:]) ―<br>\
-b6-  and it is said to occur<br>\
sometimes in the sense of ثُمَّ, (Mughnee, K, *<br>\
TA, *) denoting conjunction in an absolute manner,<br>\
with delay; (TA;) as in the saying [in the Kur<br>\
xxiii. 14] ثُمَّ خَلَقْنَا النُّطْفَةَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقْنَا الْعَلَقَةَ مُضْغَةً<br>\
فَخَلَقْنَا الْمُضْغَةَ عِظَامًا فَكَسَوْنَا الْعِظَامَ لَحْمًا [Then<br>\
we made the sperm a lump of clotted blood, then<br>\
we made the lump of clotted blood a bit of flesh,<br>\
then we made the bit of flesh bones, then we<br>\
clothed the bones with flesh]: (Mughnee, K,<br>\
TA:) ―<br>\
-b7-  and sometimes in the sense of وَ,<br>\
(Mughnee, K, * TA, *) denoting conjunction in an<br>\
absolute manner, without order; (TA;) as in<br>\
the saying (of Imra-el-Keys, TA), بَيْنَ الدَّخُولِ<br>\
فَحَوْمَلِ [as though meaning Between Ed-Dakhool and Howmal]; (Mughnee, K, TA;) the<br>\
right reading of which is asserted by As to be<br>\
with وَ; but it is replied that the implied meaning is بَيْنَ مَوَاضِعِ الدَّخُولِ فَمَوَاضِعِ حَوْمَلِ [amidst<br>\
the places of, or pertaining to, Ed-Dakhool, and<br>\
the places of, or pertaining to, Howmal; the<br>\
former places and the latter being contiguous;<br>\
and we may therefore understand these words as<br>\
relating to an antecedent command to pause];<br>\
this phrase being allowable like the saying<br>\
جَلَسْتُ بَيْنَ العُلَمَآءِ فَالزُّهَّادِ [I sat amidst the<br>\
learned men and the devotees]: it has been said<br>\
that مَا is here suppressed before بَيْنَ, and that<br>\
فَ is used in the place of إِلَى; but this usage of<br>\
فَ is strange: (Mughnee:) ―<br>\
-b8-  the third thing<br>\
that it denotes when used as an adjunctive to<br>\
an antecedent is relation to a cause: (Mughnee,<br>\
K, * TA: *) this is the second of the three<br>\
cases mentioned by J, who says, (TA,) it is<br>\
when what precedes it is a cause of what follows<br>\
it; and it denotes adjunction and proximate<br>\
sequence without association; as in the sayings<br>\
ضَرَبَهُ فَبَكَى [He beat him, and he consequently<br>\
wept,] and ضَرَبَهُ فَأَوْجَعَهُ [He beat him, and consequently pained him,] when the beating is the<br>\
cause of the weeping and of the pain: (S, TA:)<br>\
used in this manner, i. e. to denote relation to a<br>\
cause, it is generally such as adjoins a proposition, as in [the saying in the Kur xxviii. 14]<br>\
فَوَكَزَهُ مُوسَى فَقَضَى عَلَيْهِ [And Moses struck him<br>\
with his fist, and consequently killed him]; or a<br>\
qualificative, as in [the saying in the Kur lvi.<br>\
52-54] لَآكِلُونَ مِنْ شَجَرٍ مِنْ زَقُّومٍ فَمَالِئُونَ مِنْهَا<br>\
الْبُطُونَ فَشَارِبُونَ عَلَيْهِ مِنَ الْحَمِيمِ [Shall surely be<br>\
eating from trees of Zakkoom, and consequently<br>\
filling therefrom the bellies, and drinking thereon<br>\
of hot water]. (Mughnee, K.) ―<br>\
-b9-  Another manner in which it is used [the second of the three<br>\
manners before mentioned (Mughnee)] is as a<br>\
connective of an apodosis, i. e., of the complement of a conditional clause, (Mughnee, * K, *<br>\
TA,) when this is of a kind not fit to be itself<br>\
conditional, i. e., to be a protasis. (Mughnee.)<br>\
It is thus used when the complement is a<br>\
nominal proposition; as in [the saying in the<br>\
Kur vi. 17] وَإِنْ يَمْسَسْكَ بِخَيْرٍ فَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ<br>\
قَدِيرٌ [And if He cause good to betide thee, He is<br>\
able to do everything]: (Mughnee, K, TA:) this<br>\
is the third of the three cases mentioned by J,<br>\
who says, (TA,) this is when it is used for the<br>\
purpose of inception, in the complement of a<br>\
conditional clause; as in the saying إِنْ تَزُرْنِى<br>\
فَأَنْتَ مُحْسِنٌ [If thou visit me, thou wilt be a<br>\
welldoer]; in which what follows فَ is a new<br>\
proposition, grammatically independent of what<br>\
precedes it, one part thereof governing another;<br>\
for أَنْتَ is an inchoative, and مُحْسِنٌ is its enunciative; and the proposition has become a complement by means of the ف: (S, TA:) ―<br>\
-b10-  or,<br>\
(K,) secondly, (Mughnee,) the complement may<br>\
be a verbal proposition, like the nominal, and it<br>\
is one of which the verb is aplastic; as in [the<br>\
saying in the Kur xviii. 37 and 38] إِنْ تَرَنِ أَنَا<br>\
أَقَلَّ مِنْكَ مَالًا وَوَلَدًا فَعَسَى رَبِّى أَنْ يُؤْتِيَنِ [If thou<br>\
seest me to be possessing less than thou in respect<br>\
of wealth and children, it may be that my Lord<br>\
may give me]; and [the saying in the Kur ii.<br>\
273] إِنْ تُبْدُوا الصَّدَقَاتِ فَنِعِمَّا هِىَ [If ye make<br>\
apparent the alms, very good, as a thing, is it,<br>\
i. e. the doing so]: (Mughnee, K:) ―<br>\
-b11-  or, (K,)<br>\
thirdly, (Mughnee,) the verb of the complement<br>\
may be one belonging to a new proposition,<br>\
grammatically independent of what precedes it,<br>\
as in [the saying in the Kur iii. 29] إِنْ كُنْتُمْ<br>\
تُحِبُّونَ اللّٰهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِى [If ye love God, follow<br>\
ye me]: (Mughnee, K:) ―<br>\
-b12-  or, (K,) fourthly,<br>\
(Mughnee,) the verb of the complement may be<br>\
a pret., as to the letter and as to the meaning;<br>\
either properly, as in [the saying in the Kur<br>\
xii. 77] إِنْ يَسْرِقْ فَقَدْ سَرَقَ أَخٌ لَهُ مِنْ قَبْلُ [If he<br>\
steal, a brother of his hath stolen before]: or<br>\
tropically, as in [the saying in the Kur xxvii. 92]<br>\
وَمَنْ جَآءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَكُبَّتْ وُجُوهُمُمْ فِى النَّارِ [And<br>\
whoever shall have done that which is evil, their<br>\
faces are inverted in the fire of Hell], this [latter]<br>\
verb being used as though signifying what has<br>\
already happened to denote the certain assurance<br>\
of the event&#39;s happening: (Mughnee, K: *) ―<br>\
-b13-<br>\
fifthly, when the ف is coupled with a particle relating to futurity; as in [the saying in the Kur<br>\
v. 59] مَنْ يَرْتَدَّ مِنْكُمْ عَنْ دِينِهِ فَسَوْفَ يَأْتِى اللّٰهُ<br>\
بِقَوْمٍ يُحِبُّهُمْ [Whoever of you revolteth from his<br>\
religion, God will bring a people whom He<br>\
loveth]; and in [the saying in the Kur iii. 111]<br>\
وًمَا تَفْعَلُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ فَلَنْ تُكْفَرُوهُ [And what ye do<br>\
of good, ye shall not be denied the reward of it]:<br>\
(Mughnee: omitted in the K; as is also what<br>\
here next follows:) ―<br>\
-b14-  sixthly, when the ف is<br>\
coupled with a particle to which is peculiarly<br>\
assigned the first place in a proposition, as in the<br>\
saying,<br>\
فَإِنْ أَهْلِكْ فَذِى حَنَقٍ لَظَاهُ<br>\
عَلَىَّ يَكَادُ يَلْتَهِبُ الْتِهَابَا<br>\
[a verse similar in itself, and probably in its<br>\
sequel (which is not quoted), to one by Rabee&#39;ah<br>\
Ibn-Makroom (in Ham p. 29), app. meaning<br>\
And if I perish, many a one having rage in his<br>\
bosom, whose fire kindled against me almost<br>\
flames with a vehement flaming; فَذِى حَنَقٍ being for فَرُبَّ ذِى حَنَقٍ]; for رُبَّ is meant to be<br>\
understood, and to it peculiarly belongs the first<br>\
place in the proposition: (Mughnee:) ―<br>\
-b15-  the ف<br>\
must also be used when the complement of a<br>\
conditional clause is imperative; as in the saying<br>\
إِنْ أَكْرَمَكَ زَيْدٌ فَأَكْرِمْهُ [If Zeyd treat thee with<br>\
honour, treat thou him with honour]: or prohibitive; as in the saying إِنْ يُكْرِمْكَ زَيْدٌ فَلَا تُهِنْهُ [If<br>\
Zeyd treat thee with honour, treat not thou him<br>\
with contempt]: or negative, either by means of<br>\
لَنْ [as in an ex. above] or by means of مَا; as in the<br>\
saying إِنْ أَكْرَمْتَ زَيْدًا فَمَا يَهِينُكَ [If thou treat<br>\
Zeyd with honour, he does not treat thee with contempt]: (TA:) ―<br>\
-b16-  when the verb of that complement is an aor., affirmative, or negative by<br>\
means of لَا, the ف may be introduced or<br>\
omitted: in the former case you may say إِنْ<br>\
تُكْرِمْنِى فَأُكْرِمُكَ meaning فَأَنَا أُكْرِمُكَ [i. e. If thou<br>\
treat me with honour, I will treat thee with<br>\
honour]; and you may say إِنْ تُكْرِمْنِى أُكْرِمْكَ<br>\
[which is the more usual] if you do not make it<br>\
[i. e. اكرمك] the enunciative of a suppressed inchoative [i. e. of أَنَا]: and in the case of the<br>\
negative by means of لا you may say إِنْ تُكْرِمْنِى<br>\
فَلَا أُهِينُكَ [If thou treat me with honour, I will<br>\
not treat thee with contempt; and you may omit<br>\
the ف as is more usual]: (TA:) ―<br>\
-b17-  and sometimes the ف is suppressed in the case of necessity<br>\
in verse [on account of the metre]; as in the<br>\
saying,<br>\
مَنْ يَفْعَلِ الْحَسَنَاتِ اللّٰهُ يَشْكُرُهَا<br>\
[Whoso doth those deeds that are good, God will<br>\
recompense them, i. e., the deeds], (Mughnee,<br>\
K,) meaning فَاللّٰهُ: (K:) or, (Mughnee, K,)<br>\
accord. to Mbr, who disallows this even in verse,<br>\
(Mughnee,) the right reading is<br>\
مَنْ يَفْعَلِ الخَيْرَ فَالرَّحْمٰنُ يَشْكُرُهُ<br>\
[Whoso doth that which is good, the Compassionate<br>\
will recompense it]; (Mughnee, K;) and it is<br>\
absolutely disallowable: (K:) or it occurs in<br>\
chaste prose, (Mughnee, K, *) accord. to Akh;<br>\
(Mughnee;) and hence the saying [in the Kur<br>\
ii. 176] إِنْ تَرَكَ خَيْرًا الْوَصِيَّةُ لِلْوَالِدَيْنِ وَالْأَقْرَبِينَ<br>\
[If he leave wealth, the legacy shall be to the two<br>\
parents and the nearer of other relations]; and<br>\
the trad. respecting that which one has picked<br>\
up, or taken, of property that has been dropped,<br>\
فَإِنْ جَآءَ صَاحِبُهَا وَإِلَّا اسْتَمْتِعْ بِهَا [And if the owner<br>\
thereof come, restore thou it to him; and if not,<br>\
or otherwise, benefit thyself by it]: (Mughnee,<br>\
K:) ―<br>\
-b18-  when the verb of the complement of a<br>\
conditional clause is a pret. as to the letter but<br>\
future as to the meaning intended [yet not importing certainty, so that it is not like the saying in<br>\
the Kur xxvii. 92, cited above], the ف may not<br>\
be prefixed to it; as in the saying إِنْ أَكْرَمْتَنِى<br>\
أَكْرَمْتُكَ [If thou treat me with honour, I will<br>\
treat thee with honour]: and likewise when it is<br>\
pret. as to the [proper] signification but [an aor.<br>\
as to the letter and] future as to the meaning intended; as in the saying إِنْ أَسْلَمْتَ لَمْ تَدْخُلِ النَّارَ<br>\
[If thou become a Muslim, thou wilt not enter the<br>\
fire of Hell]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b19-  And as the ف thus connects the apodosis with its protasis, so it connects the like of the apodosis with the like of the<br>\
protasis; as in the saying اَلَّذِى يَأْتِينِى فَلَهُ دِرْهَمٌ<br>\
[Who comes, or shall come, to me, for him is, or<br>\
shall be, a dirhem]: by its being introduced in<br>\
this case, one understands what the speaker<br>\
means, that the obligation to give the dirhem is<br>\
a consequence of the coming: otherwise the saying would be ambiguous. (Mughnee.) Thus also<br>\
it occurs after a clause commencing with the conditional particle أَمَّا, q. v. (Mughnee in art. أَمَّا;<br>\
&amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b20-  It also occurs in the cases here following,<br>\
prefixed to an aor., which is mansoob by means<br>\
of أَنْ, meant to be understood, (S, TA, and I&#39;Ak<br>\
p. 295,) but necessarily suppressed: (I&#39;Ak ibid.:)<br>\
―<br>\
-b21-  thus in the complement of a command; (S,<br>\
TA, and I&#39;Ak p. 296;) as in اِئْتَنِى فَأُكْرِمَكَ<br>\
[Come thou to me, that I may treat thee with<br>\
honour]: (I&#39;Ak ibid.:) [and] you say زُرْنِى<br>\
فَأُحْسِنَ إِلَيْكَ [Visit thou me, that I may do good<br>\
to thee]; (S, TA;) to which J adds, you do not<br>\
make the visiting to be the cause of the doing<br>\
good; what you [would] say being, it is of my<br>\
way to do good always; but [there seems be an<br>\
omission here in the copies of the S, for, as] IB<br>\
says, if you make أُحْسِن to be marfooa, [not<br>\
mansoob,] saying فَأُحْسِنُ إِلَيْكَ, [the meaning is,<br>\
for I will do good to thee, for] you do not make<br>\
the visiting to be the cause of the doing good:<br>\
(TA:) the demand, however, in this and similar<br>\
cases, must not be indicated by a verbal noun,<br>\
nor by an enunciative; for when it is so indicated, the aor. must be marfooa; as in صَهْ<br>\
فَأُحْسِنُ إِلَيْكَ [Be silent, then I will do thee good];<br>\
and in حَسْبُكَ الحَدِيثُ فَيَنَامُ النَّاسُ [The discourse<br>\
is sufficient for thee, so the people shall sleep]:<br>\
(I&#39;Ak p. 296:) ―<br>\
-b22-  also in the complement of a<br>\
prohibition; (S, and I&#39;Ak p. 296;) as in لَا تَضْرِبْ<br>\
زَيْدًا فَيَضْرِبَكَ [Beat not thou Zeyd, for he may<br>\
beat thee, or lest he beat thee]: (I&#39;Ak ibid.:) ―<br>\
-b23-<br>\
and in the complement of a prayer; as in رَبِّ<br>\
انْصُرْنِى فَلَا أُخْذَلَ [My Lord aid me, so that I<br>\
may not be left helpless]: (I&#39;Ak ibid.:) ―<br>\
-b24-  and in<br>\
the complement of an interrogation; (S, and<br>\
I&#39;Ak p. 296;) as in هَلْ تُكْرِمُ زَيْدًا فَيُكْرِمَكَ [Wilt<br>\
thou treat Zeyd with honour, that he may treat<br>\
thee with honour?]: (I&#39;Ak ibid.:) ―<br>\
-b25-  and in the<br>\
complement of a petition with gentleness; (S,<br>\
and I&#39;Ak p. 296;) as in أَلَا تَنْزِلُ عِنْدَنَا فَتُصِيبَ<br>\
خَيْرًا [Wilt thou not alight at our place of abode,<br>\
that thou mayest obtain good?]: (I&#39;Ak ibid.:)<br>\
―<br>\
-b26-  and in the complement of a demanding with<br>\
urgency the performance of an action; as in لَوْلَا<br>\
تَأْتِينَا فَتُحَدِّثَنَا [Wherefore dost thou not come to<br>\
us, that thou mayest talk to us?]: (I&#39;Ak p. 296:)<br>\
―<br>\
-b27-  and in the complement of an expression of<br>\
wish; as in لَيْتَ لِى مَالًا فَأَتَصَدَّقَ مِنْهُ [Would<br>\
that I had wealth, that I might give alms thereof]: (I&#39;Ak ibid.:) ―<br>\
-b28-  and in the complement of<br>\
an expression of hope, in like manner as in the<br>\
case next before mentioned, accord. to the Koofees<br>\
universally; as in the saying in the Kur [xl. 38<br>\
and 39] لَعَلِّى أَبْلُغُ الْأَسْبَابَ أَسْبَابَ السَّمٰوَاتِ فَأَطَّلِعَ<br>\
[May-be I shall reach the tracts, or the gates,<br>\
the tracts, or the gates, of the heavens, so that I<br>\
may look], accord. to one reading: (I&#39;Ak p.<br>\
298:) ―<br>\
-b29-  and in the complement of a negation,<br>\
(S, and I&#39;Ak p. 295,) i. e., of a simple negation;<br>\
as in مَا تَأْتِينَا فَتُحَدِّثَنَا [Thou dost not come to us,<br>\
that thou mayest talk to us; a saying mentioned<br>\
before, in the first of the remarks on this<br>\
particle]. (I&#39;Ak ibid.) ―<br>\
-b30-  It is also prefixed as a<br>\
corroborative to an oath; as in فَبِعِزَّتِكَ [which<br>\
may be rendered Now by thy might, or nobility,<br>\
&amp;c.], and فَوَرَبِّكَ [Now by thy Lord]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b31-<br>\
The third manner in which it is [said to be]<br>\
used is when it is redundant, so that its being<br>\
included in a saying is like its being excluded:<br>\
but this usage is not affirmed by Sb: Akh allows<br>\
its being redundant in the enchoative, absolutely;<br>\
mentioning the phrase أَخُوكَ فَوُجِدَ [as though<br>\
meaning Thy brother, he has been found; but<br>\
هٰذَا is app. meant to be understood, so that the<br>\
phrase should be rendered, fully, this is thy<br>\
brother, and he has been found]: Fr and ElAalam and a number of others restrict its being<br>\
allowable to the cases in which the enunciative<br>\
is a command, as in the saying,<br>\
وَقَائِلَةٍ خَوْلَانُ فَانْكِحْ فَتَاتَهُمْ<br>\
and in the saying,<br>\
أَنْتَ فَانْظُرْ لِأَىِّ ذَاكَ تَصِيرُ<br>\
or a prohibition, as in the saying زَيْدٌ فَلَا تَضْرِبْةُ;<br>\
but those who disallow its being so explain the<br>\
first of these three exs. by saying that the implied<br>\
meaning is هٰذِهِ خَوْلَانُ, [so that the saying<br>\
should be rendered, fully, Many a woman is<br>\
there saying, This is Khowlán (the tribe so named),<br>\
therefore marry thou their young woman; and in<br>\
like manner the implied meaning of the third ex.<br>\
is هٰذَا زَيْدٌ فَلَا تَضْرِبْهُ This is Zeyd, therefore do<br>\
not thou beat him;] and the implied meaning of<br>\
the second ex. is اُنْظُرْ فَانْظُرْ, [so that the saying<br>\
should be rendered, fully, Look thou, and look to<br>\
what result thereof thou wilt eventually come,]<br>\
