فَضَلَ, aor.<br>\
فَضُلَ; and فَضِلَ, aor.<br>\
فَضِلَ; and فَضِلَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
فَضُلَ; three syn. dial. vars.; (S, O, Msb, K;) the<br>\
second mentioned by ISk; and the third [said to<br>\
be] anomalous and unparalleled; (S, O;) [but]<br>\
it is a compound of two thereof, (S, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
accord. to the companions of Sb, (S, O,) i. e. a<br>\
compound of the second and the third, (K,) like<br>\
نَعِمَ having for its aor. يَنْعُمُ, (Sb, S, O, Msb,)<br>\
and نَكِلَ, aor. يَنْكُلُ, [but this I do not find in its<br>\
proper art.,] and حَضِرَ, aor. يَحْضُرُ, [but this is<br>\
disallowed by some,] and فَرِغَ, aor. يَفْرُغُ, among<br>\
perfect verbs, (Msb,) and مِتَّ, aor. تَمُوتُ, and<br>\
دِمْتَ, aor. تَدُومُ, (Sb, S, O, Msb,) and كِدْتَ,<br>\
aor. تَكُودُ; (Sb, S;) inf. n. فَضْلٌ: (S, * O, * Msb,<br>\
K: *) all signify It exceeded; or was, or became,<br>\
redundant, or superfluous; [syn. زَادَ;] being used<br>\
in relation to الفَضْلُ (K, MF, TA) meaning<br>\
الزِّيَادَةُ, as Ibn-Es-Seed says, (MF, TA,) [i. e.] as<br>\
meaning the contr. of النَّقْصُ: (K, TA:) or the<br>\
first of the three, i. e. فضَلَ, aor.<br>\
فَضُلَ, inf. n. فَضْلٌ,<br>\
signifies thus, i. q. زَادَ, (Msb,) and فُضْلٌ and فُضُلٌ<br>\
are also inf. ns. [of the same, i. e.] signifying زِيَادَةٌ,<br>\
as in the saying, in a trad., accord. to different<br>\
relaters, إِنَّ لِلّٰهِ مَلَائِكَةً سَيَّارَةً فُضْلًا عَلَى المَلَائِكَةِ<br>\
المُرَتَّبِينَ مَعَ الخَلَائِقِ and فُضُلًا [i. e. Verily to God<br>\
belong angels who occupy themselves in ranging<br>\
about, in addition to the angels who are stationed<br>\
among the created, or human and other, beings]:<br>\
(TA:) and all the three dial. vars. mentioned<br>\
above signify it remained [of a greater quantity or<br>\
number]; syn. بَقِىَ; (S, * O, * Msb;) you say,<br>\
فَضَلَ مِنْهُ شَىْءٌ, aor.<br>\
فَضُلَ; and فَضِلَ, aor.<br>\
فَضَلَ; and فَضِلَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
فَضُلَ; somewhat remained thereof: (S, O:) or<br>\
from الفَضْلُ as meaning البَقِيَّةُ, you say فَضَلَ like<br>\
نَصَرَ, [i. e. aor.<br>\
فَضُلَ,] and فَضِلَ like حَسِبَ, [implying that the aor. is<br>\
فَضَلَ and<br>\
فَضِلَ,] (K,) [accord. to the<br>\
TK meaning it had somewhat remaining, but<br>\
accord. to SM,] using these verbs [which are said<br>\
by him to be like نَصَرَ and سَمِعَ and حَسِبَ, the<br>\
last as mentioned by Lh,] in the phrase فَضَلَ مِنْهُ<br>\
شَىْءٌ [expl. above]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [فَضَلَ is trans. as<br>\
well as intrans.] One says, فَضَلَهُ and فَضَلَ عَلَيْهِ,<br>\
[aor.<br>\
فَضُلَ,] inf. ns. فَضْلٌ and فُضُولٌ, [but see a distinction made between these two words voce فَضْلٌ,<br>\
below,] meaning He, or it, exceeded, or excelled,<br>\
him, or it. (MA.) See also 4. [And see فَضْلٌ<br>\
below, last signification.] الفَضْلُ as meaning The<br>\
overcoming, or surpassing, in highness, elevation,<br>\
or eminence, of rank, condition, or estimation, has<br>\
but one form of verb, فَضَلَ, aor.<br>\
فَضُلَ, like قَعَدَ, aor.<br>\
يَقْعُدُ: he who relates the saying of the poet,<br>\
وَجَدْنَا نَهْشَلًا فَضَلَتْ فُقَيْمَا<br>\
[We found, or have found, that Nahshal (the<br>\
tribe so called) overcame &amp;c., or have overcome<br>\
&amp;c., Fukeym (another tribe)], pronouncing the<br>\
ض [in فضلت] with kesr, errs; not distinguishing<br>\
between the two meanings: so says Ibn-Es-Seed,<br>\
in the book entitled “ Kitáb el-Fark: ” and Es-<br>\
Seymuree says, in his book entitled “ Kitáb etTebsireh,” فَضَلَ, aor.<br>\
فَضُلَ, like نَصَرَ, aor. يَنْصُرُ, is<br>\
from الفَضْلُ meaning the ruling [others] as a<br>\
chief, lord, or master. (TA.) And فَضَلَهُ signifies<br>\
also [simply] He overcame him; surpassed him;<br>\
or gained ascendency, or the mastery, over him.<br>\
(TA.) See also 3.<br>\
2<br>\
فضّلهُ (K, TA) عَلَى غَيْرِهِ, (TA,) inf. n.<br>\
تَفْضِيلٌ, i. q. مَزَّاهُ, (K, TA,) i. e. He attributed to<br>\
him an excellence distinguishing him from [or<br>\
above] another, or others: (TA:) or فَضَّلْتُهُ عَلَى<br>\
غَيْرِهِ, inf. n. as above, I judged him (S, O, Msb, *<br>\
TA) to be more excellent than another, or others:<br>\
(S, * O, * Msb, TA: *) or I made him (S, O, Msb, *<br>\
TA) to be so. (S, * O, * Msb, TA.) وَفَضَّلْنَاهُمْ عَلَى<br>\
كَثِيرٍ مِمَّنْ خَلَقْنَا, in the Kur [xvii. 72, i. e. And<br>\
we have made them to excel many of those that we<br>\
have created], has been expl. as meaning that the<br>\
excellence of the son of Adam consists in his<br>\
walking erect, whereas the beasts, the camels<br>\
and the asses and the like, walk pronely; and<br>\
the son of Adam takes food with his hands,<br>\
whereas the other animals take it with the mouth.<br>\
(TA.) And وَاللّٰهُ فَضَّلَ بَعْضَكُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ, in the<br>\
Kur [xvi. 73, i. e. And God hath made some of<br>\
you to excel some others], means, in ability, and<br>\
wealth, and rank or station, and power; which<br>\
are excellences that may be acquired. (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA.) And you say, فضّلهُ بِهِ, meaning خَصَّهُ [i. e.<br>\
He distinguished him particularly, peculiarly, or<br>\
specially, by it, namely, a thing]. (A and K in<br>\
art. خص.) And فضّل فِى العَطَآءِ He gave to<br>\
some more than to others. (S in art. افق.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [An<br>\
explanation of فضّل given by Golius, as on the<br>\
authority of the K, (“ i. q. وسخ, Sordibus infecit,<br>\
vel pro sordida habuit, quotidianam vestem,”) is<br>\
a strange mistake; app. caused by his finding in<br>\
a copy of the K التَّفْضِيلُ التَّوْسِيخُ instead of<br>\
التَّفَضُّلُ التَّوَشُّحُ: see 5. ―<br>\
-b3-  اِسْمُ التَّفْضِيلِ The noun<br>\
of the attribution of excess or excellence is a term<br>\
applied to the comparative and superlative noun<br>\
or epithet; also called أَفْعَلُ التَّفْضِيلِ, because it<br>\
is regularly of the measure أَفْعَلُ: see exs. voce<br>\
خَيْرٌ.]<br>\
3<br>\
الفِضَالُ [and المُفَاضَلَةُ inf. ns. of فَاضَلَ] and<br>\
↓ التَّفَاضُلُ [inf. n. of 6 (of which see an ex. in art.<br>\
سوى, conj. 6,)] signify التَّمَازِى فِى الفَضْلِ [i. e.<br>\
The contending for superiority in excellence]; (K, *<br>\
TA;) التَّمَازِى being of the measure تَفَاعُل from<br>\
المَزِيَّةُ. (TA.) And you say, ↓ فَاضَلْتُهُ فَفَضَلْتُهُ,<br>\
(S, O, K, * in the last فَاضَلَنِى,) aor. of the latter<br>\
فَضُلَ,<br>\
(TA,) inf. n. فَضْلٌ, (O, TA,) I contended with<br>\
him for superiority, or vied with him, in excel-lence, (O, TA,) and I surpassed him, or outvied<br>\
him, therein. (S, O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فاضل بَيْنَ<br>\
الشَّيْئَيْنِ [app. He made the relation between the<br>\
two things to be unequal in respect of excellence;<br>\
i. e. he made the two things to be unequal, or<br>\
unlike each other, in excellence; contr. of سَاوَى<br>\
بَيْنَهُمَا: see also 6]. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
افضل فِى تِجَارَتِهِ He gained; or made gain,<br>\
or profit; in his traffic; syn. رَبِحَ. (Az and Msb<br>\
in art. ربح.) ―<br>\
-b2-  عَنْهُ [and عَنْهُ ↓ فَضَلَ, aor.<br>\
فَضُلَ,<br>\
inf. n. فَضْلٌ, (see فَضْلٌ below, last signification,<br>\
and see also فَاضِلٌ,)] It exceeded it. (K, TA.<br>\
[See also 1, latter half.]) Ows says, describing<br>\
a bow,<br>\
كَقَوْسٍ طِلَاعِ الكَفِّ لَا دُونَ مِلْئِهَا<br>\
وَلَا عَجْسُهَا عَنْ مَوْضِعِ الكَفِّ أَفْضَلَا<br>\
[Like a bow of which the part that is grasped is<br>\
sufficient in size for the filling of the hand, not less<br>\
than suffices to fill it, nor does the part that is<br>\
grasped thereof extend beyond the place of the<br>\
hand: the pret. being here used for the aor. to<br>\
suit the metre]. (TA. [But my original has<br>\
كَقَوْمٍ, an evident mistranscription.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  افضل<br>\
عَلَيْهِ: see 5, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  أَفْضَلْتُ مِنْهُ الشَّىْءَ<br>\
and ↓ اِسْتَفْضَلْتُ signify the same, (S, O, K, TA,)<br>\
i. e. I left of it the thing remaining, or redundant.<br>\
(O, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تفضّل عَلَيْهِ [in the CK (erroneously) فَضَّلَ]<br>\
i. q. تَمَزَّى, (K, TA,) both of which signify He<br>\
thought himself to be superior to him in excellence;<br>\
(TA in art. مزو;) whence the saying in the Kur<br>\
[xxiii. 24], يُرِيدُ أَنْ يَتَفَضَّلَ عَلَيْكُمْ, meaning He<br>\
desireth that he may have superiority over you in<br>\
rank and station: (TA in the present art.) or<br>\
i. q. عليه ↓ افضل, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
إِفْضَالٌ, (Msb, TA,) i. e. he bestowed, or conferred,<br>\
a benefit, or benefits, upon him, syn. أَحْسَنَ, (S,<br>\
TA,) or تَطَوَّلَ, (K, TA,) and gave him of his<br>\
bounty: (TA:) [and each, followed by بِشَىْءٍ, he<br>\
presented him, or favoured him, with a thing:] or<br>\
تفضّل signifies, (K,) or signifies also, (S,) he laid<br>\
claim to superiority of excellence over his equals,<br>\
or fellows; (S, K;) whence [accord. to some] the<br>\
saying in the Kur quoted above: (S:) and [you<br>\
say] عَلَيْهِ فِى الحَسَبِ ↓ افضل, (K, TA,) meaning<br>\
he became possessed of eminence. [or superiority,<br>\
over him, in the grounds of pretension to respect<br>\
or honour,] as in a verse of Dhu-l-Isba&#39; cited voce<br>\
عَنْ, [q. v., p. 2164,] ending with فَتَخْزُوْنِى for<br>\
فَتَخْزُوَنِى, [which latter reading I have there<br>\
given,] because the rhyme of the whole ode requires the former. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  التَّفَضُّلُ also signifies التَّوَشُّحُ [generally meaning The throwing a<br>\
portion of one&#39;s garment over his left shoulder,<br>\
and drawing its extremity under his right arm,<br>\
and tying the two extremities together in a knot<br>\
upon his bosom]: and the putting, or disposing,<br>\
the extremities of his two garments, or pieces of<br>\
cloth, contrariwise, or in contrary directions, upon<br>\
his عَاتِق [or part between the shoulder and the<br>\
neck]. (K, TA: but in the former, عَلَى عَاتِقَيْهِ is<br>\
erroneously put for على عَاتِقِهِ. TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
تَفَضَّلَتْ said of a woman in her tent or chamber<br>\
or house, She was in a single garment; (S, O,<br>\
TA;) [she wore a single garment;] such as is<br>\
termed مِفْضَلٌ [q. v.]: (S, TA:) or she (a woman)<br>\
wore the garments of her service. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تَفَاْضَلَ see 3. ―<br>\
-b2-  التَّفَاضُلُ بَيْنَ القَوْمِ means The<br>\
differing in superiority, or excellence, of some over<br>\
others, among the people, or party. (TA.) And<br>\
one says, الأَشْيَآءُ تَتَفَاضَلُ [meaning The things are<br>\
unequal, or unlike, one to another, in respect of<br>\
excellence; contr. of تَتَسَاوَى: see also 3]. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استفضل أَلْفًا He took a thousand [dirhems]<br>\
in excess of his right, or due. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also 4.<br>\
فَضْلٌ [an inf. n.: (see 1, throughout:) and also<br>\
a simple subst., signifying] An exceeding, a redundant, or a superfluous, quantum [of anything,<br>\
good or evil]; an excess, a redundance, or a<br>\
superfluity; syn. زِيَادَةٌ; (Mgh, Msb;) contr. of<br>\
نَقْصٌ: (S, O, K:) [and often meaning superabundance, or exuberance; and surpassingness,<br>\
superiority, or excellence. عَلَى غَيْرِهِ over another,<br>\
or others, than him, or it: and preponderance:]<br>\
the pl. is فُضُولٌ (Mgh, Msb, K:) and this is<br>\
sometimes used as a sing.; (Er-Rághib, Msb;)<br>\
and [thus used] relates to a thing [or quality] in<br>\
which is no good; (Er-Rághib, Mgh, Msb;) by<br>\
a predominant application; whence the saying<br>\
فُضُولٌ بِلَا فَضْلٍ [excess without excellence]; (Mgh;)<br>\
and hence the rel. n. ↓ فُضُولِىٌّ is formed from it:<br>\
(Er-Rághib, Msb, TA;) [see this last word, one<br>\
of the explanations of which shows that a particular meaning of فُضُولٌ is the quality of busying<br>\
oneself with that which does not concern him:]<br>\
accord. to Er-Rághib, فَضْلٌ signifies an excess [in<br>\
respect of a property or quality, or of an acquisition,] above moderateness; and this is of two<br>\
sorts; such as is commended, as the فضل of<br>\
knowledge, or science ; and such as is discommended, as the فصل of anger at that whereat<br>\
it is not necessary: but فَضَلٌ is more used in<br>\
relation to that which is commended; and [the<br>\
pl.] فُضُولٌ, in relation to that which is discommended. when the former is used of an excess<br>\
[in respect of some attribute, of our of two things<br>\
above the other, it is of three sorts; فضل of kind,<br>\
as of the animal kind above the vegetable kind;<br>\
and of species, as of man above other animals;<br>\
and of the individual, as of one man above<br>\
another; the first and second of which three are<br>\
essential attributes, such that he who is deficient<br>\
in [either of] them cannot do away with his<br>\
deficiency and acquire فضل, as, for instance, the<br>\
horse, and the ass, which cannot acquire the<br>\
excellence (فَضِيلَة) of the human being; but the<br>\
third may be accidental, such that the way may<br>\
be found to acquire it, and of this sort are ability,<br>\
wealth, rank or station, and power: and it signifies also any gift whereof the giving to the recipient<br>\
thereof is not obligatory: [i. e. a free gift, or<br>\
gratuity; and an act of bounty or grace; a<br>\
favour; a benefit; and bounty as an abstract<br>\
term;] as in the saying [in the Kur iv. 36], وَاسْأَلُوا<br>\
اللّٰهَ مِنْ فَضْلِهِ [And ask ye God of his free gift, or<br>\
of his bounty, or (as expl. in the Ksh and by Bd)<br>\
of his exhaustless treasures]; and in the saying in<br>\
the Kur [v. 59 and lvii. 21 and lxii. 4], ذٰلِكَ فَضْلُ<br>\
اللّٰهِ يُؤْتِيهِ مَنْ يَشَآءُ [That is the free gift of God;<br>\
He giveth it to whom He willeth]; which comprises the three sorts of excellences (فَضَائِل) [mentioned above]: thus says Er-Rághib: El-Muná-<br>\
wee says, [explaining one of its meanings,] in the<br>\
“ Towkeef,” that it is the commencing, or originating, of an act of beneficence without an efficient<br>\
cause [i. e., app., not by reason of any obligation].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A portion remaining, (K, TA,)<br>\
of a thing, such as food &amp;c., and of water in the<br>\
leathern water-bag, and of wine or beverage in<br>\
the vessel; (TA;) and ↓ فَضْلَةٌ and ↓ فُضَالَةٌ signify<br>\
the same, (K, TA,) or a redundant portion (S<br>\
and O and Msb in explanation of these two<br>\
words) of a thing: (S, O:) whence the saying of<br>\
the vulgar, ↓ لِلْفَضِيلِ ↓ الفَضْلَةُ i. e. The remaining<br>\
portion of the wine or beverage [is for the excel-lent]. (TA.) It is said in a trad., لَا يُمْنَعُ فَضْلُ<br>\
المَآءِ لِيُمْنَعَ بِهِ الكَلَأُ [The redundance of water shall<br>\
not be denied that the herbage be thereby denied]:<br>\
(TA, in the present art.:) meaning that when<br>\
there is a well in the desert, with herbage near<br>\
it, and a person prevents others from drawing<br>\
water, he thereby prevents the latter from availing themselves of the herbage; for when a man<br>\
comes with his camels, and pastures them upon<br>\
that herbage, and does not then water them,<br>\
thirst kills them. (TA in art كلأ,) And it is<br>\
said in another trad., فَضْلُ الإِزَارِ فِى النَّارِ [The<br>\
redundant portion of the waist-wrapper is in the<br>\
fire of Hell]; meaning what one drags [thereof]<br>\
upon the around, by reason of pride. (TA;) And<br>\
one says, فِى يَدِهِ فَضْلُ الزِّمَامِ, meaning [In his<br>\
hand is] the end of the زمام [or nose-rein of the<br>\
camel]. (TA.) ذَاتُ الفُضُولِ and ↓ الفضُولِ, with<br>\
damm and with fet-h, [The thing having redundant portions] is the name of the coat of mail of<br>\
the Prophet, which was thus called because<br>\
having redundance and ampleness. (TA.) فُضُولُ<br>\
الغَنَائِمِ means The remains of the spoils when they<br>\
are divided (TA;) such as a single horse, or a<br>\
single camel (KL.) And by the فُضُول of women<br>\
are meant The remains of the menstrual discharge<br>\
(Ham p. 107: see, there, explanations of a verse<br>\
in which this occurs.) (??) [The confederacy, or covenant, of the فضول, a word<br>\
which is here of uncertain meaning,] is thus explained: Háshim and Zuhrah and Teym [accord.<br>\
to the CK Teymà] went in to &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-Jud&#39;án, and united in a confederacy to repel<br>\
wrongdoing, and to exact the due from the<br>\
wrongdoer; and it was thus called because they<br>\
bound themselves by their confederacy not to<br>\
leave in the possession of any one aught remaining [of property] whereof he aught despond any<br>\
one, without their taking it for him [i. e. the<br>\
latter] from him [i. e. the former] (O, K, TA:<br>\
[in the CK, يَظْلِمُهُ أَحَدٌ is a mistake for يظلمه<br>\
أَحَدًا:]) or it was thus called as being likened to<br>\
a confederacy, or covenant, which was made of<br>\
old, at Mekkeh, in the days of Jurhum, to act<br>\
with mutual equity, and to take for the weak<br>\
from the strong, and for the stranger from the<br>\
resident, and in which three men, every one of<br>\
whom was named El-Fadl, joined: and it was also<br>\
called that of the مَطَيَّبُون. (TA. [See art. طيب.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  The saying لَا يَمْلِكُ دِرْهَمًا فَضْلًا عَنْ دِينَارٍ, and<br>\
the like may be said of other sayings similar to<br>\
it, means He does not possess a dirhem nor a<br>\
deenár [or rather much less a deenár]: it is as<br>\
though one said, he does not possess a dirhem:<br>\
how then should he possess a deenár? for the<br>\
negation of that which is much is a necessary<br>\
consequence of the negation of that which is<br>\
little: فَضْلًا is here in the accus case as an inf. n.;<br>\
the implied meaning being فَقَدَ مِلْكَ دِرْهَمٍ فَقْدًا<br>\
يَفْضُلُ عَنْ فَقْدِ مِلْكِ دينَارٍ [or rather يَفْقِدُ &amp;c.,<br>\
i. e. he lacks the possession of a dirhem with a<br>\
lacking exceeding the lacking of the possession of a<br>\
deenár]: (Msb:) Kutb-ed-Deen Esh-Sheerázee<br>\
says, (Msb, TA,) in the Expos. of the “ Miftáh,”<br>\
(TA,) فَضْلًا is used in a case in which the inferior<br>\
[of two things] is deemed a thing of which the<br>\
existence is improbable, and the impossibility of<br>\
the existence of a thing that is above it is meant<br>\
thereby; wherefore it occurs between two phrases<br>\
differing in meaning; and it is mostly used after<br>\
a particle of negation: (Msb, TA:) AHei says<br>\
that he had not found any authority for it in the<br>\
[classical] language of the Arabs. (Msb. [See<br>\
also بَلْهَ, which is used in a somewhat similar<br>\
manner.])<br>\
فُضُلٌ Wearing a single garment, such as is<br>\
termed مِفْضَلٌ; an epithet applied to a woman;<br>\
(S, Mgh, * O, K;) and also to a man; (S, O, K;)<br>\
like ↓ مُتَفَضِّلٌ: (O, K:) it is of the dial. of Nejd;<br>\
like فُرُجٌ in the dial. of El-Yemen. (L in art. فرج.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And A woman proud, or self-conceited, or so<br>\
in her gait; who makes a portion of her skirt to<br>\
be redundant [so that it drags upon the ground<br>\
when she walks]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also مِفْضَلٌ, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
فَضْلَةٌ: see فَضْلٌ, former half, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence, as used by grammarians,] A dispensable<br>\
member of a proposition; such as the objective<br>\
complement of a verb, when the suppression<br>\
thereof is not detrimental [to the meaning];<br>\
contr. of عُمْدَةٌ. (I&#39;Ak, p. 143) [The pl. is<br>\
فَضَلَاتٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And The clothes that are used for<br>\
sleeping [therein]: (K, TA:) [so called] because<br>\
they are an addition over and above the clothes<br>\
that are used on various [other] occasions. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And Wine; and so ↓ فِضَالٌ [which see also in<br>\
what here follows]: (O, K:) الفَضْلَةُ is mentioned<br>\
by A&#39;Obeyd as a name for wine: (O:) or it<br>\
signifies, accord. to AHn, the wine that alters [or<br>\
has become altered] in colour after oldness; and<br>\
ISd says that it is so called because the choice, or<br>\
best, or most excellent, part thereof [for لأنّ<br>\
حميمها in my original (an obvious mistranscription) I read لِأَنَّ صَمِيمَهَا ] is what remains: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. is فَضَلَاتٌ and فِضَالٌ [the latter word mentioned above as a syn. of فَضْلَةٌ]. (K.)<br>\
فِضْلَةٌ is a n. of the same kind as جِلْسَةٌ and<br>\

in which I do not find it;) the latter occurring in<br>\
a trad., and expl. in the Nh as signifying it became<br>\
a فَضَآء [q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And It was, or became,<br>\
empty, vacant, or void; (for it is said in the TA<br>\
that الفضو, by which الفُضُوُّ is evidently meant,<br>\
signifies الخُلُوُّ;) as also ↓ افضى, as appears from<br>\
an explanation of the part. n. مُفْضٍ, q. v.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
فَضَا الشَّجَرُ بِالمَكَانِ, inf. n. فضو [i. e. فُضُوٌّ], The<br>\
trees became numerous, or abundant, [so as to<br>\
occupy much space,] in the place. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\

became in the space, or the place, or quarter, of<br>\
such a one: (M:) or properly, became in the فَضَآء<br>\
of such a one. (Mgh.) And in like manner,<br>\
افضى إِلَيْهِ الأَمْرُ [The thing, or event, came to, or<br>\
reached, him]. (M.) And أَفْضَيْتُ إِلَى الشَّىْءِ I<br>\
came to, or reached, the thing. (Msb.) Accord.<br>\
to IAar, (TA,) الإِفْضَآءُ properly signifies الاِنْتِهَآءُ<br>\
[i. e. The coming at last, or ultimately, or the<br>\
reaching, to a person or thing]. (IAar, T, Msb,<br>\
TA.) Hence the saying [in the Kur iv. 25],<br>\
وَقَدْ أَفْضَى بَعْضُكُمْ إِلَى بَعْضٍ i. e. When one of you<br>\
hath come, and betaken himself, to the other;<br>\
(TA;) in which the verb is made trans. by means<br>\
of إِلَى because having the meaning [of اِنْتَهَى or]<br>\
of وَصَلَ: (M:) or this means, when one of you<br>\
hath become alone with the other, agreeably with<br>\
the original derivation; or, accord. to some, it is<br>\
an allusion to mutual contact, skin to skin: or to<br>\
copulation. (Mgh.) You say, افضى إِلَى امْرَأَتِهِ<br>\
[He went in to his wife: or] he became in contact<br>\
with his wife, skin to skin: (S, Msb:) or it signifies, (M, K,) or signifies also, (S, Msb,) (tropical:)  he<br>\
compressed his wife: (S, M, Msb, K:) or he was,<br>\
or became, with her alone in private, whether he<br>\
compressed her or not. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  افضى بِهِمْ He<br>\
reached with them, or brought them to, a wide, or<br>\
spacious, place. (TA.) And افضى بِهِ الطَّرِيقُ إِلَى<br>\
وَعْرٍ مِنَ الأَرْضِ [The road brought him to a rugged<br>\
tract of land]. (K * and TA in art. وعر) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
افضى بِيَدِهِ إلَى الأَرْضِ He touched the ground with<br>\
the palm of his hand (IF, S, Msb, K) in his prostration [in prayer]. (S, K.) And أَفْضَيْتُ إِلَيْهِ<br>\
بِيَدِى مِنْ غَيْرِ حَائِلٍ I put my hand to it without<br>\
anything intervening; i. q. مَسَسْتُهُ (Msb in art<br>\

or made known, to such a one my secret]: (S;) or<br>\

(Msb. TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  افضى also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He became<br>\
poor: so says IAar: as though he came to the<br>\
ground. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  لَا يُفْضِى اللّٰهُ فَاكَ, occurring<br>\
in a trad., is a phrase expressive of a prayer,<br>\
meaning May God not make thy mouth wide and<br>\
empty. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the saying of IAar,<br>\
الإِفْضَآءُ أنْ تَسْقُطَ الثَّنَايَا مِنْ تَحْتُ وَمِنْ فَوْقُ [app.<br>\
meaning that اِفْضَآءٌ is the inf. n. of أُفْضِىَ signifying His central incisors, below and above, fell out:<br>\
or he was caused to lose them]: and hence [the<br>\
epithet] المُفْضَاةُ [and therefore hence also what<br>\
here follows]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  افضى المَرْأَةَ He made<br>\
the woman&#39;s مَسْلَكَانِ (i. e. her vagina and rectum,<br>\
Msb) to become one, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
in devirginating her, (Msb,) or in compressing<br>\
her; (TA;) the intervening part becoming rent:<br>\
(Mgh, TA:) and so أَفَاضَهَا: (M, in which it is<br>\
mentioned in art. فضى:) the epithet applied to<br>\
her is ↓ مُفْضَاةٌ, (M, Mgh, Msb, K,) which is syn.<br>\
with شَرِيمٌ. (S.)<br>\

ثَوْبَهُ فَضًا [He threw down his garment in a disorderly, or cureless, manner;] he did not commit<br>\
his garment to any one&#39;s care. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also<br>\
One; a single thing or person: and alone; by<br>\
itself or himself; not having any other with it or<br>\
him; apart from others: thus it has two contrmeanings.] You say سَهْمٌ فَضًا One, or a single,<br>\
arrow. (K:) or an arrow that is alone, by itself,<br>\
not having any other with it, in the quiver. (AA,<br>\
TA.) And بَقِيتَ فَضًا I remained alone, (Az, K,<br>\
