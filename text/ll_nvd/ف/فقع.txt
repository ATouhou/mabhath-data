and فَقْعٌ, (K,) said of the colour of a thing, (S,<br>\
O,) It was intensely yellow: (S, O, K:) or its<br>\
yellowness was free from admixture. (K, TA.<br>\
[See also فَقْعٌ below.]) [And] فَقَعَ said of a skin,<br>\
or hide, or a tanned, or red, skin or hide, (أَدِيم,)<br>\
It was beautiful and clear [in colour]. (Ham<br>\
p. 562.)<br>\
-A2-  فَقَعَ said of a boy, He became active,<br>\
and grew, grew up, or became a young man; (K, *<br>\
TA; [in both of which it is implied that the aor.<br>\
of the verb in this and the next two senses<br>\
is<br>\
فَقَعَ and<br>\
فَقُعَ, as above;]) and so ↓ تفقّع. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
And فَقَعَ (K, TA) said of a man, (TA,) He died<br>\
from, or in consequence of, the heat. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  فَقَعَتِ الفَوَاقِعُ فُلَانًا The calamities of time, or<br>\
fortune, crushed such a one. (K, * TA.)<br>\
-A5-  فَقَعَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
فَقَعَ, (K,) inf. n. فَقْعٌ, (O,) He stole. (O, K.<br>\
[Accord. to the TK, trans. in this sense.])<br>\
-A6-<br>\
And He emitted wind from the anus, with a<br>\
sound; (K, TA;) in which sense the inf. n. is<br>\
likewise فَقْعٌ; accord. to some, peculiarly said of<br>\
an ass: and بِهِ ↓ فَقَّعَ, and ↓ بِمِفْقَعٍ, and ↓ بِمِفْقَاعٍ,<br>\
inf. n. تَفْقِيعٌ, he did so vehemently. (TA.)<br>\
-A7-  فَقِعَ,<br>\
i. e. like فَرِحَ, (K, TA,) inf. n. فَقَعٌ, (TK,) said of<br>\
a man, (TA,) He became red. (K, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
فقّع, (TA,) inf. n. تَفْقِيعٌ, (O, K, TA,) He<br>\
twisted the sides of his mouth, or opened his mouth<br>\
and was diffuse, in speech, (O, K, TA,) and uttered<br>\
speech that had no meaning. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فقّع<br>\
أَصَابِعَهُ, (S, O, * TA,) inf. n. as above, (S, O, K,<br>\
TA,) i. q. فَرْقَعَهَا, (S, O, * K, * TA, *) [He cracked<br>\
the joints of his fingers;] i. e. he pressed his fingers<br>\
so that a sound was heard to proceed from their<br>\
joints: (TA:) the action signified thereby is forbidden to be performed in prayer: (O, TA:) [but<br>\
it is said that] this is the contracting of the fingers<br>\
to the inner side of the hand and making a sound<br>\
with the outer side [app. by pressing the fist upon<br>\
the ground so as to make the joints of the fingers<br>\
crack, when rising; for I think that any action<br>\
more irregular than this would be too obviously<br>\
wrong to need prohibition]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فقّع<br>\
الوَرْدَةَ, inf. n. تَفْقِيعٌ, He made the rose into a<br>\
round form (أَدَارَهَا), and then struck it so that it<br>\
rent open, or asunder, producing a sound: (O:)<br>\
or التَّفْقِيعُ signifies the striking a rose with the<br>\
hand, (O, K,) or the making a rose-leaf into a<br>\
round [and app. hollow] form, and pressing it<br>\
with the fingers, (TA,) so that it produces a sound,<br>\
(O, K, TA,) when rending open, or asunder.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And فقّع signifies also It cracked with<br>\
a sound: and it crackled: said of a flint-stone in<br>\

5<br>\
تَفَقَّعَ see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Reiske, as stated by Freytag,<br>\
has explained this verb as signifying It was, or<br>\
became, contracted; said of a hand: but probably, I think, in consequence of his having<br>\
found تَفَقَّعَت erroneously written for تَقَفَّعَت.]<br>\
6<br>\
تفاقعت عَيْنَاهُ His eyes became white: (O,<br>\
K, TA:) or became cleft, or fissured: or had in<br>\

more commonly, Intense yellowness: or yellowness<br>\
free from admixture: see 1, first sentence.]<br>\
-A2-<br>\
And i. q. حُصَاصٌ [app. as meaning An emission<br>\
of wind from the anus, with a sound]. (S, O,<br>\
TA. [See 1, last sentence but one.])<br>\
-A3-  Also,<br>\
and ↓ فِقْعٌ, (S, O, K,) the latter mentioned by<br>\
ISk, (S, O,) A species of كَمْأَة [or truffles]; (S,<br>\
O;) accord. to A &#39;Obeyd, (S, O,) the white and<br>\
soft thereof: (S, O, K;) which is the worst<br>\
thereof; or, as IAth says, a species of the worst<br>\
[kind] of كمأة, accord. to AHn, it comes forth<br>\
from the ground so as to appear, white, and is<br>\
bad; the good being that which is extracted by<br>\
digging: Lth says, It is a كَمْء [or truffle] that<br>\
comes forth from the base of the plant called إِجْرِد<br>\
[q. v.], and is of the worst of كمأة, and the<br>\
quickest in becoming corrupt: (TA:) the pl. is<br>\
فِقَعَةٌ, (S, O, K,) which is of both forms of the<br>\
sing.; (S, O, TA;) and فَقْعٌ, with fet-h, has for<br>\
pls. أُفْقُعٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and فُقُوعٌ [a pl. of mult.].<br>\
(AHn, TA.) A vile man is likened thereto: (S,<br>\
O, K: *) one says, هُوَ أَذَلُّ مِنْ فَقْعِ قَرْقَرٍ, (S,) or<br>\
مِنْ فَقْعٍ بقَرْقَرَةٍ, (O, K,) [He is more vile than the<br>\
فقع of, or than فقع In, a (??) and soft tract of<br>\
ground,] because the beasts kick it along, (S,) or<br>\
because it offers not resistance to the gatherer<br>\
thereof, or because it is trodden with the feet, (O,<br>\
K,) and the beasts kick it along. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [From<br>\
a mention of the pl. فَقُوعٌ in art. ذأن, and in the<br>\
present art. in the TA, it appears that فَقْعٌ is also<br>\
applied to The species of fungus called ذُؤْنُون, and<br>\
to the species called طُرْثُوث, &amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,<br>\
perhaps,] فَقْعٌ [as a coll. a.] signifies also (assumed tropical:)  Pointed<br>\
toes (خَرَاطِيم of a sort of boots (O, TA.)<br>\
فِقْعٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
فَقَاعٍ; see what next follows.<br>\
فُقَاعٍ; (O, and thus in my MS, copy of the K;<br>\
in other copies of the K فُقَاع or فُقَاعٌ; and in all<br>\
the copies is added بالضَّمِّ كَرُبَاع or كَرُبَاعٍ; [but<br>\
there is no such word as رُبَاعٍ. nor رُباعٌ; whence<br>\
it seems to be meant that we should read كَرُبَاعَ;<br>\
i. e. فُقَاعُ, like رُباعُ, imperfectly decl.; but see<br>\
what follows;]) so says Ibn-Buzurj: (O:) or,<br>\
(O, K,) accord. to AZ, (O,) ↓ فقاعٍ, (O, K, *) like<br>\
رُبَاعٍ, (O.) [i. e.] with fet-h, like ثَمَانٍ (كَثَمَانٍ):<br>\
(K:) [which suggests that كَرُبَاعٍ may be an<br>\
early mistranscription for كَربَاعٍ, and that فُقَاع is<br>\
wrong, and only فَقَاعٍ right, though it is said in<br>\
one place in the TA that فَقَاع is like سَحَاب, i. e.<br>\
that it is فَقَاعٌ:] or it is ↓ فَقِيعٌ, like أَمِيرٌ; (K,<br>\
TA;) so accord. to El-Jáhidh, as mentioned by<br>\
Az: (TA:) applied to a man, as meaning Red;<br>\
(O, K, TA;) intensely so; by reason of إِغْرَاب<br>\
[i. e. app., goodliness of condition]: (O, TA:) and<br>\
↓ فُقَاعِيٌّ, as an epithet applied to a man, signifies<br>\
red. (TA.)<br>\
فَقِيعٌ, (so in the O,) or ↓ فِقِّيعٌ, like سِكِّيتٌ, (K,)<br>\
but the former, like أَمِيرٌ, is the right, [a coll. gen.<br>\
n.,] and its n. un. is with ة, (TA,) The white, of<br>\
pigeons; (K, TA;) said by El-Jáhidh to be such,<br>\
of pigeons, as are like the صِقْلَابِىّ [or Sclave] of<br>\
men; (O, TA;) a kind of white pigeon; so called<br>\
as being likened to a [white] species of truffle<br>\
[i. e. the فَقْع]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَبْيَضُ فَقِيعٌ, (so in the<br>\
O,) or ↓ ابيض فِقِّيعٌ, like سِكِّيتٌ, (K,) White that<br>\
is intense (O, K) in whiteness. (O.) [See also<br>\
فَاقِعٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  فَقِيعٌ as an epithet applied to a man:<br>\
see فُقَاعٍ.<br>\
فُقَّاعٌ: see فُقَاعٍ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see فَاقِعٌ, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
فَقَّاعٌ One who emits wind from the anus, with a<br>\
sound, much, or frequently. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Strong,<br>\
or vehement; and bad, corrupt, or wicked. (Lth,<br>\
O, K.)<br>\
فُقَّاعٌ. 1 certain beverage, (S, O, L, K,) [a sort<br>\
of beer.] made from barley: (L, TA:) [but there<br>\
are several sorts thereof, perhaps peculiar to postclassical times: (see De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe,<br>\
see, ed., vol. i., pp. 149-154:)] so called because<br>\
of the froth that rises upon its head. (O, K. [See<br>\
فُقَّاعَةٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A certain plant, (AHn, O, K.)<br>\
such as is termed ↓ مُتَفَقِّعٌ, i. e., (AHn, O, K. *)<br>\
which, when it dries up, becomes hard, and as<br>\
though it were horns. (AHn, O, K.) [Now applied in North-Western Africa to The toadstool,<br>\
which is called in other parts فُطْرٌ.]<br>\
فِقِّيعٌ: see فَقِيعٌ, in two places.<br>\
فُقَّاعَةٌ, like رُمَّانَةٌ, sing. of فَقَاقِيعُ, (TA,) which<br>\
signifies The bubbles that rise upon water, (S, O,<br>\
K, TA,) and upon wine, (O,) [&amp;c.,] round, [or<br>\
globular.] (TA,) like قَوَارِير [or vessels of glass].<br>\
(S, O, TA.)<br>\
فُقَّاعِىٌّ A seller of [the beverage called] فُقَّاع.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
فَاقِعٌ (S, O, K) and ↓ فُقَاعِىٌّ (K) Yellow intensely yellow; (S, O, K;) thus both signify:<br>\
(Lh, K, TA:) or red intensely red: (K:) or red<br>\
free from an admixture of whiteness: or purely<br>\
red: (TA:) or فَاقِعٌ is applied to white and to<br>\
any other colour as signifying free from admixture; (K;) and ↓ فُقَاعِىٌّ is applied in this sense<br>\
to white: (TA:) and ↓ أَفْقَعُ, of which the pl. is<br>\
فُقْعٌ, signifies intensely white. (K.)<br>\
فَاقِعَةٌ A calamity, or misfortune: (S, O, K:)<br>\
pl. فَوَاقِعُ. (S, O, K. *)<br>\
أَفْقَعُ; pl. فُقْعٌ: see فَاقِعٌ.<br>\
فَقْرٌ مُفْقِعٌ, accord. to the K, signifies مُدْقِعٌ [as<br>\
though meaning Poverty causing to cleave to the<br>\
dust or earth]: but the right phrase is فَقِيرٌ مُفْقِعٌ,<br>\
signifying مُدْقِعٌ [i. e. a poor person cleaving to<br>\
the dust or earth: for أَدْقَعَ is intrans. as well as<br>\
trans.]; which denotes the worst condition, like<br>\
مَجْهُودٌ. (TA.) [See 4.]<br>\
مِفْقَعٌ and ↓ مِفْقَاعٌ [The anus (as being the instrument) with which wind is emitted vehemently,<br>\
with a sound]: see 1, last sentence but one.<br>\

having its fore part pointed. (TA in art. خرطم.)<br>\

or similar, dung. (O.)<br>\
مِفْقَاعٌ: see مِفْقَعٌ; and 1, last sentence but one.<br>\
مُتَفَقِّعٌ: see فُقَّاعٌ.<br>\
