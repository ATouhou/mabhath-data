فَازَ, aor. يَفُوزُ, inf. n. فَوْزٌ (S, A, O, Msb, K)<br>\
and مَفَازٌ and مَفَازَةٌ, (TA,) He attained, acquired,<br>\
gained, or won, good, or good fortune, (S, A, O,<br>\
Msb, * K,) or his wish or desire, or what he desired<br>\
or sought; (Bd in iii. 182, and TA;) he met<br>\
with, or experienced, that for which one would be<br>\
regarded with a wish to be in the like condition,<br>\
without its being desired that it should pass away<br>\
from him; he became far from what was disliked,<br>\
or hated, or evil: (TA:) he succeeded, or was successful: he won, or gained the victory: (Msb:)<br>\
[he had his arrow drawn, or] his arrow came<br>\
forth [from the رِبَابَة], in the game called المَيْسِر:<br>\
and (tropical:)  it (an arrow) won; or came forth before its<br>\
fellow [or fellows in that game]. (O, * TA.) You<br>\
say, فَازَ بِهِ He attained it, acquired it, gained it,<br>\
or won it; (Kh, A, O, Msb, K;) namely, good,<br>\
or good fortune; (Kh, O;) or reward: (A:)<br>\
and he took it away, went away with it. (S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  He became safe, or secure; he escaped. (S,<br>\
A, O, Msb, K.) You say, فَازَ مِنهُ He became<br>\
safe, or secure, from it; he escaped it; (A, O,<br>\
K;) namely, evil; (TA;) or punishment. (A, O,<br>\
TA.) And طُوبَى لِمَنْ فَازَ بِالثَّوَابِ وَفَازَ مِنَ العِقَابِ<br>\
A happy end is his who gains reward and escapes<br>\
punishment. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  And فَازَ, (S, O, K,) aor.<br>\
يَفُوزُ, (TA,) inf. n. فَوْزٌ, (S, A, K,) (tropical:)  He perished:<br>\
(S, A, K:) he died; and so ↓ فَوَّزٌ: (S, A, O, Msb,<br>\
K:) thus the former bears two contr. significations: (A, K:) but IB says that, accord. to some,<br>\
the latter is not used in this sense unless preceded<br>\
by another phrase such as in the following ex.:<br>\
فُلَانٌ بَعْدَهُ ↓ مَاتَ فُلَانٌ وَفَوَّزَ [Such a one died and<br>\
such a one died after him]: and accord. to others,<br>\
↓ فوّز signifies (tropical:)  he became in the مَفَازَة [or state of<br>\
temporary safety] which is between the present life<br>\
and that which is to come. (TA.) [This last signification is given in the A.] ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2.<br>\
2<br>\
فوّز (assumed tropical:)  He went, or his course brought him, to<br>\
the مَفَازَة: (IAar, TA:) or (tropical:)  he went upon the<br>\
مفازة: (A, TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  he went away. (IAar, O,<br>\
K:) or (tropical:)  he went away into the مفازة: (A:) and<br>\
↓ فَازَ signifies (assumed tropical:)  he traversed the مفازة. (Msb.)<br>\
You say, فوّز بِإِبِلِهِ (S, A, O, K) (tropical:)  He entered upon<br>\
the مفازة with his camels. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He went forth from one land or country to<br>\
another: and ↓ تفوّز signifies the same as فوّز.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 1, latter part, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  And, said of a road, It was, or became, apparent: (O, K:) and Sgh adds. [but not in the<br>\
O,] and it stopped, or came to an end. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
افازهُ بِكَذَا He (God, S, O, K, or a man,<br>\
Msb) caused him to attain, acquire, gain, or win,<br>\
such a thing. (S, O, Msb, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَفَوَّزَ see 2.<br>\
فَازٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
فَازَةٌ A [tent such as is called] مِظَلَّة, (S, K.)<br>\
with two poles, (K,) or that is extended with a<br>\
pole: (S; in which is added, “it is in my opinion<br>\
an Arabic word: ”) pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]<br>\
↓ فَازٌ. (ISd, TA.)<br>\
فَائِزَةٌ (tropical:)  A thing that rejoices one, and by which<br>\
one attains good or the object of his desire: you<br>\
say, فَازَ بِفَائِزَةٍ (tropical:)  He attained, acquired, gained, or<br>\
won, a thing that rejoiced him, &amp;c. (A, O, * TA.)<br>\
مَفَازٌ: see the following paragraph, near the<br>\
end.<br>\
مَفَازَةٌ A place of safety, security, or escape. (S,<br>\
A, O, K.) So in the Kur [iii. 185], فَلَا تَحْسِبَنَّهُمْ<br>\
بِمَفَازَةٍ مِنَ العَذَابِ [Do thou by no means reckon<br>\
them to be in a place of security from punishment]: (S, A, * O:) or, accord. to Fr, the meaning<br>\
here is, far from punishment. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A cause,<br>\
or means, of prosperity, or success, or of the attainment or acquisition of that which one desires<br>\
or seeks, or of what is good, or of that whereby<br>\
one becomes in a happy or good state; syn. مَفْلَحَةٌ.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  [The state of temporary safety which<br>\
is between the present life and that which is to<br>\
come. See 1, last signification.]<br>\
-A2-  (tropical:)  A place of<br>\
perdition, or destruction: (Msb, K: *) or i. q. فَلَاةٌ:<br>\
(A:) [i. e.] a desert; syn. بَرِّيَّةٌ; any [desert such<br>\
as is called] قَفْرٌ: (TA:) or a desert in which is<br>\
no water: (ISh, O, K:) and a desert in which is<br>\
no water for the space of a journey of two nights<br>\
or more: when there is none for the space of a<br>\
journey of a night and a day, it is not thus called.<br>\
(ISh, O, TA:) or a tract in which two wateringplaces are so far apart that camels are kept from<br>\
drinking two days, with a portion of the day preceding them and of the day following them, [accord.<br>\
to that which is generally preferred of the explanations of the term رِبْعٌ which is here employed,]<br>\
and other animals [that journey quicker] drink on<br>\
alternate days; as also فَلَاةٌ: or such as is between<br>\
that in which camels are kept from drinking two<br>\
days &amp;c. as above, and that in which other animals<br>\
drink on alternate days; as also فَيْفَاةٌ: (TA:) so<br>\
called to prognosticate good fortune, and safety.<br>\
(As, IF, S, A, O, Msb,) as meaning a place of<br>\
safety, (A,) from فَازَ signifying “ he became safe: ”<br>\
(Msb:) or from فَوَّزَ, (IAar, S, O, * Msb,) or فَازَ.<br>\
(AHei, TA.) signifying “ he perished,” (IAar,<br>\
S, O, * AHei,) or “ he died: ” (Msb, TA:) AHei<br>\
condemns the former of these assertions; but Az<br>\
and ISd say that it is the more commonly approved, though the latter is the more agreeable<br>\
with analogy: (TA:) or it is so called because<br>\
he who comes forth from it, having traversed it,<br>\
is safe: (IAar, TA:) the pl. is مَفَاوِزُ: (S:) and<br>\
↓ مَفَازٌ signifies the same as مَفَازَةٌ. so in a trad. of<br>\
Kaab Ibn-Málik; فَاسْتَقْبَلَ سَفَرًا بَعِيدًا وَمَفَازًا [And<br>\
he saw before him, or looked forward to, a far<br>\
journey and a desert, or a waterless desert, &amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
