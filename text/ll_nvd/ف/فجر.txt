فَجُرَ, (T, L, Msb,) inf. n. فَجْرٌ, (T,<br>\
Mgh, L, Msb,) He clave, [a thing]; cut, or<br>\
divided, [it] lengthwise: this is the primary signification, whence several others, to be mentioned<br>\
below, are derived: (T, L:) he clave, and opened.<br>\
(Mgh.) He clave, or cut, a subterranean channel<br>\
for water. (Msb.) He broke open a dam of a<br>\
river or the like, that the water might break, burst,<br>\
or pour, through. (T, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فَجَرَ المَآءَ, (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above; (S,<br>\
O;) and ↓ فجّرهُ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. تَفْجِيرٌ; (O, TA;)<br>\
but the latter is with teshdeed to denote muchness, or frequency, or repetition, of the action, or<br>\
its application to many objects; (S, O, TA;) He<br>\
opened a way, passage, vent, or channel, for the<br>\
water to flow forth; gave vent to it; vented it:<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb:) he made the water to flow,<br>\
run, or stream: (K:) and in like manner, blood,<br>\
or other fluid. (TA.) [See also 4.]<br>\
-A2-  فَجَرَ, aor.<br>\
فَجُرَ,<br>\
inf. n. فُجُورٌ, (S, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) He, or it, inclined; leant; declined; or deviated. (S, O, TA.)<br>\
You say, فَجَرَ الرَّاكِبُ, (K,) aor. as above, (TA,)<br>\
and so the inf. n., (K,) (tropical:)  The rider leant, or declined, from his saddle. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] He<br>\
declined, or deviated, from the truth; (K, * TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ افجر. (IAar, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He erred<br>\
in answering, or replying. (El-Muärrij.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Hence<br>\
also, (S,) He lied; (S, O, Msb, K;) said of a<br>\
swearer; (Msb;) as also ↓ افجر: (IAar, O, K:)<br>\
in this sense the former has also فَجْرٌ for an inf. n.,<br>\
as well as فُجُورٌ: (TA:) he committed a foul deed;<br>\
such as swearing a false oath, or lying: in which<br>\
sense also it has both of these inf. ns. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
He committed an unlawful action: (ISh:) [or,<br>\
as it is generally explained, and most frequently<br>\

and [in like manner] ↓ فاجر, inf. n. مُفَاجَرَةٌ and<br>\
فِجَارٌ, he did that which was vitious, immoral, unrighteous, sinful, or wicked. (R, TA.) In the<br>\
sense of عصى (Mgh, O, TA) and خالف (O, TA)<br>\
it is also trans.: you say فَجَرَهُ, meaning He disobeyed him; (Mgh, O, TA;) he opposed him. (O,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  He launched forth into acts of disobedience; in which sense it has both of the inf. ns.<br>\
mentioned above; (K, TA;) and is [said to be]<br>\
from فَجَرَ in the first of the significations expl.<br>\
above. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  He disbelieved; syn. كَفَرَ;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ افجر: (IAar, O, K:) and فَجَرَ<br>\

The following passage of the Kur, بَلْ يُرِيدُ<br>\
الْإِنْسَانُ لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ, [lxxv. 5], is said to mean,<br>\
[But man desireth, or nay, doth man desire,] to<br>\
disbelieve in that which is before him, [or that<br>\
which is to come,] namely, the resurrection and<br>\
reckoning and retribution: (O, TA:) or to continue in his فُجُور [i. e. vice, immorality, wickedness, unrighteousness, or the like,] in the time to<br>\
come: (Bd:) or to go on therein undeviatingly:<br>\
(El-Hasan El-Basree, O:) or to defer repentance,<br>\

will repent at a future time. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  He did,<br>\
or committed, an action inducing doubt, or suspicion or evil opinion, or doubt combined with suspicion or evil opinion. (IKtt, TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  He committed adultery, or fornication; (Msb, K;) in<br>\
which sense it has both of the inf. ns. mentioned<br>\
above; (K;) and ↓ افجر signifies the same;<br>\
(IAar, K;) and, this latter, he committed an act,<br>\
or acts, of disobedience with his genital member.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) You say فَجَرَ بِالْمَرْأَةِ He committed<br>\
adultery, or fornication, with the woman: and<br>\
فَجَرَتِ الْمَرْأَةُ The woman committed adultery, or<br>\
fornication. (TA.) ―<br>\

Their case, or state of affairs, became bad. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b12-  And فَجَرَ signifies also He became dim, or<br>\

-b13-  And فَجَرَ مِنْ مَرَضِهِ<br>\

2<br>\
فجّرهُ: see 1, near the beginning.<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
He attributed or imputed to him, or charged him<br>\
with, or accused him of, فُجُور [i. e. vice, immorality, unrighteousness, &amp;c. (see 1)]; like فَسَّقَهُ:<br>\
whence the phrase, in a trad. of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr,<br>\
فَجَّرْتَ بِنَفْسِكَ [Thou hast attributed to thyself, or<br>\
accused thyself of, unrighteousness, transgression,<br>\
or the like]. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\

-b2-  And<br>\

أَجْزَلَ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O.)<br>\
-A2-  افجر as intrans.:<br>\
see 1, in four places.<br>\
-A3-  Also افجرهُ He found<br>\
him to be a person such as is termed فَاجِرٌ. (O,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A4-  And افجر is like اصبح; (S, O;) signifying He entered upon the time of daybreak, or<br>\
dawn: (K, TA:) and he was near to entering<br>\
upon that time. (TA.) One says, كُنْتُ أَحُلُّ إِذَا<br>\
أَسْحَرْتُ وَأَرْحَلُ إِذَا أَفْجَرْتُ [I used to alight when<br>\
I entered upon the last sixth of the night, and<br>\
depart when I entered upon the time of daybreak].<br>\
(S, TA.) And أُعَرِّسُ إِذَا أَفْجَرْتُ وَأَرْحَلُ إِذَا أَسْفَرْتُ,<br>\

upon the time of daybreak, and I depart when [I<br>\
enter upon the time in which] the dawn shines.<br>\

-A5-  Also He brought much<br>\
property; (O, K;) this being termed فَجَرٌ. (O.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَفَجَّرَ see the next paragraph, in four places.<br>\
7<br>\
انفجر (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ تفجّر, (S, O, K,)<br>\
but the latter is with teshdeed [as quasi-pass. of<br>\
2,] to denote muchness, or frequency, or repetition, or application to many subjects of the action,<br>\
(S, O, *) It (water) had a way, passage, vent, or<br>\
channel, opened for it to flow forth; it had vent;<br>\
(S, O, Msb;) it poured out, or forth, as though<br>\
impelled or propelled; syn. اِنْبَعَثَ; (TA;) it<br>\
flowed, ran, or streamed. (Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
انفجر عَلَيْهِمُ العَدُوُّ (tropical:)  The enemy [poured upon<br>\
them;] came upon them suddenly, in great number.<br>\
(L, A.) And انفجرت عَلَيْهِمُ الدَّوَاهِى (tropical:)  Calamities<br>\
[poured upon them;] came upon them from every<br>\
quarter, (K, * TA,) abundantly and suddenly.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] انفجر بِالْكَرَمِ, and ↓ تفجّر<br>\
بِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He was profuse of generosity, or liberality]:<br>\
(K:) and فِى الخَيْرِ ↓ تفجّر (assumed tropical:)  [he was profuse in<br>\
bounty, or beneficence]. (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And انفجر<br>\
الصُّبْحُ, and ↓ تفجّر, [The dawn broke forth]: and<br>\
انفجر عَنْهُ اللَّيْلُ [The night departed from before<br>\
it; namely, the rising dawn]. (K.)<br>\
8<br>\
افتجر فِى الكَلَامِ He forged speech, not having<br>\
heard it from any one, nor learned it. (O, K.)<br>\
فَجْرٌ [Daybreak; dawn;] the light of morning;<br>\
(Mgh, K;) because it is a cleaving of the darkness from before the light; (Mgh;) i. e., the redness of the sun in the darkness of night; (K;) the<br>\
فَجْر in the end of the night is like the شَفَق in the<br>\
beginning thereof: (S, O:) it is twofold: the<br>\
first is called الفَجْرُ الكَاذِبُ [the false dawn]; that<br>\
which rises without extending laterally, (المُسْتَطِيلُ,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) which appears black, presenting itself<br>\
like an obstacle (مُعْتَرِضًا) [on the horizon]: (Msb:)<br>\
[see ذَنَبُ السِّرْحَانِ, in art. سرح:] the second is<br>\
called الفَجْرُ الصَّادِقُ [the true dawn]; which is the<br>\
rising and spreading [dawn], (المُسْتَطِيرُ, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) which appears rising, and fills the horizon<br>\
with its whiteness; and this is what is called عَمُودُ<br>\
الصُّبْحِ; rising after the former has disappeared;<br>\
and by its rising the day commences, and everything by which fasting would be broken becomes<br>\
unlawful to the faster. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, The<br>\
time of the فَجْر. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And The prayer of<br>\
that time: the prefixed noun being suppressed.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  الفَجْرُ and البَحْرُ [in a saying mentioned voce بَحْرٌ, the former here written الفَجَرُ,<br>\
and said to be مُحَرَّكَة, but app. by mistake, for<br>\
it is afterwards written الفَجْرُ,] are metonymically<br>\
applied to (tropical:)  The troubles of the present state of<br>\
existence. (TA.)<br>\

K;) bounty, or munificence; (K;) or large, or<br>\
ample, bounty or munificence; (AO, TA;) and<br>\
goodness, or beneficence. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Property.<br>\
(Kr, K.) And Much property. (O.) And Abundance of property. (K, TA.) Aboo-Mihjen EthThakafee says,<br>\
فَقَدْ أَجُودُ وَمَا مَالِى بِذِى فَجَرٍ<br>\
[And verily, or often, I practise liberality, or<br>\
bounty, while my property is not abundant].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
فُجَرُ: see فَاجِرٌ, latter half.<br>\
فَجْرَةُ is a proper name, [i. e. an attributive<br>\
proper name,] imperfectly decl., like بَرَّةُ; [and<br>\
signifies the same as الفَجْرَةُ and فَجَارِ;] and<br>\
↓ فَجَارِ is altered from فَجْرَةٌ, (IJ, TA,) or from<br>\
الفَجْرَةُ, (Sb, TA,) and is a subst. in the sense of<br>\
الفُجُورُ [i. e. Vice, immorality, wickedness, unrighteousness, sin, or transgression, &amp;c., (see 1,)]<br>\
(S,) or a name for الفَجْرَةُ [which signifies the<br>\
same], (O,) like قَطَامِ, (S, O,) determinate, (S,)<br>\
occurring in a verse of En-Nábighah cited in the<br>\
first paragraph of art. حمل. (S, O.) One says,<br>\
رَكِبَ فُلَانٌ فَجْرَةَ, (K, * TA, [in the CK فَجَرَةَ,])<br>\
and ↓ فَجَارِ, (TA,) Such a one lied; (K, TA;)<br>\
and acted vitiously &amp;c. (فَجَرَ). (TA.) And حَلَفَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ عَلَى فَجْرَةَ, and اِشْتَمَلَ عَلَى فَجْرَةَ, [in the L<br>\
على فَجْرِهِ, in both instances, but the former is<br>\
the right reading,] Such a one commited a foul<br>\
deed, by swearing falsely, [relating to the former<br>\
phrase,] or by adultery, or fornication, or lying.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
فُجْرَةٌ: see مَفْجَرٌ, in two places.<br>\
فِجْرَةٌ The last of a woman&#39;s children; like as<br>\
زِنْيَةٌ signifies the “ last of a man&#39;s children. ” (TA<br>\
in art. زنى.)<br>\

فَاجِرٌ, last sentence but one.<br>\
فِجَارٌ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned]<br>\

q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  أَيَّامُ الفِجَارِ is an appellation<br>\
applied to Four أَفْجِرَة; (K, TA;) the four أَفْجِرَة<br>\
meaning days [i. e. conflicts] of the Arabs; the<br>\
single day thereof being termed الفِجَارُ: (S, O,<br>\
TA:) they took place at &#39;Okádh; and those<br>\
engaged therein transgressed, and held to be<br>\
allowable everything that should be sacred; as<br>\
is said in the A: they were called فِجَارُ الرَّجُلِ<br>\
and فِجَارُ المَرْأَةِ and فِجَارُ القِرْدِ and فِجَارُ البَرَّاضِ;<br>\
the last, which was the greatest onslaught, being<br>\
thus called in relation to El-Barrád Ibn-Keys,<br>\
who slew &#39;Orweh Er-Rahhál: (TA:) they were<br>\
between Kureysh with their associates of Kináneh<br>\
on the one side and Keys-&#39;Eylán on the other<br>\
side, (S, O, K,) in the Time of Ignorance; (S, O;)<br>\
and the [final] defeat befell Keys; it occurred in<br>\
the sacred months; and when they fought therein,<br>\
they said فَجَرْنَا; (S, O, K;) therefore Kureysh<br>\
called this war فِجَار; (S, O, TA; *) فِجَارٌ, like<br>\
مُفَاجَرَةٌ, being an inf. n. of فَاجَرَ, expl. above, on<br>\

signifies also مُكَذِّبٌ [as meaning disbelieving; or<br>\
a disbeliever; see فَجَرَ بِهِ, in the middle of the<br>\
first paragraph]. (TA.) And one says يَمِينٌ<br>\
فَاجِرَةٌ meaning (tropical:)  A false oath: (Mgh in art. غمس:)<br>\
a tropical phrase. (Mgh in the present art.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
فَاجِرٌ and ↓ فَجُورٌ, (K, TA,) the latter of which is<br>\
applied to a woman as well as to a man, (TA,)<br>\
and ↓ فَاجُورٌ, (K, TA,) which is mentioned by<br>\

or an enchanter: (Sgh, K, TA:) the pl. of the<br>\
first is فُجَّارٌ and فَجَرَةٌ; and the pl. of the second<br>\
and third is فُجُرٌ. (K, TA.) ↓ فُجَرُ is altered<br>\
from فَاجِرٌ, for the sake of intensiveness, and is<br>\
[determinate, and] seldom used except in the<br>\
vocative form of speech: you say [in addressing<br>\
a number of men] يَا لَفُجَرَ [for يَا آلَ فُجَرَ, like as<br>\
you say يَا لَغُدَرَ for يَا آلَ غُدَرَ, q. v.; and meaning<br>\
O ye very vitious, &amp;c.]; occurring in a trad. of<br>\
&#39;Áïsheh. (TA.) And ↓ فَجَارِ, (K, TA,) like قَطَامِ,<br>\
(TA,) is a noun altered from الفَاجِرَةُ (K, TA) [or<br>\
from فَاجِرَةُ]: you say (S, O, K) to a woman (S,<br>\
O) يَا فَجَارِ (S, O, K) meaning يَا فَاجِرَةُ [O vitious<br>\
woman, &amp;c.]. (S, O.)<br>\

مَفَاجِرُ الوَادِى signifies The parts, of the valley,<br>\
into which the torrent disperses itself: (S, O, TA:)<br>\
and الوَادِى ↓ فُجْرَةُ, (K, TA,) which would seem<br>\
to be with fet-h [to the ف] from its not being<br>\
restricted by the mention of any syll. signs, [and<br>\
is so in the CK,] but is correctly with damm,<br>\
(TA,) the wide part of the valley, into which the<br>\
water pours. (K, TA.) And مَفَاجِرُ الدِّبَارِ signifies The places opened for the flowing of the<br>\
