فَصُحَ, (S, A, Mz in the 9th نوع, and so in<br>\
some copies of the K as stated in the TA,) [aor.<br>\
فَصُحَ,]<br>\
inf. n. فَصَاحَةٌ, (KL,) or فَصْحٌ; (Mz ubi suprà,<br>\
on the authority of Er-Rághib;) or ↓ فصّح; (so<br>\
in other copies of the K;) or the latter also; (A;)<br>\
and ↓ افصح; (A, K, Mz;) said of milk, It became divested of the froth, (S, A, K, Mz,) which<br>\
is the primary signification accord. to Er-Rághib;<br>\
(Mz;) and clear of its biestings: (A:) or ↓ افصح<br>\
has this latter signification. (S, L, K.) And<br>\
فَصْحٌ, accord. to Er-Rághib, signifies [also] A<br>\
thing&#39;s becoming clear of what was mixed with it.<br>\
(Mz ubi suprà.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] فَصُحَ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K, and Mz ubi suprà,) [aor.<br>\
فَصُحَ,] inf. n. فَصَاحَةٌ (S,<br>\
K) and فَصْحٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  He (a man) was, or became,<br>\
good in his language, or dialect; a metaphorical<br>\
signification from the same verb as said of milk;<br>\
so accord. to Er-Rághib: (Mz: see also 4: [and<br>\
see فَصَاحَهٌ below:]) or he (a foreigner) was, or<br>\
became, good and correct in his language, or dialect: (S, Msb:) or he [a man] was, or became,<br>\
clear, perspicuous, or distinct, in speech, or language: and he (a foreigner) spoke Arabic intelligibly: but this signification seems to belong<br>\
more properly to أَفْصَحَ, q. v.:] or he [a man] was<br>\
an Arab [by birth, and therefore in speech], and<br>\
he increased in فَصَاحَة [q. v.]; like ↓ تفصّح: (K:)<br>\
and he was, or became, eloquent; (L;) thus used<br>\
as syn. with بَلُغَ [from which it is properly distinct]. (MF.)<br>\
-A2-  قَدْ فَصَحَكَ الصُّبْحُ [is said to<br>\
mean] (assumed tropical:)  Daybreak has become apparent to thee,<br>\
and its light has overcome thee: (K, * TA:) and<br>\
some say, فَضَحَكَ: [or,] accord. to Lh, فَصَحَهُ<br>\
الصُّبْحُ means daybreak came upon him suddenly.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

-b2-  It is also said of urine, (K, TA,) as mentioned by IAar, but not expl. by him, (TA,)<br>\
meaning It became clear, or free from turbidness.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And افصحت is said of a ewe, or she-goat, (S, A, K,) and of a she-camel, (TA,)<br>\
meaning Her milk became free from admixture;<br>\
(K;) or free from froth, and clear of its biestings:<br>\
(A:) or her biestings ceased, and the milk came<br>\
after: (Lh, TA:) or her biestings ceased, and her<br>\
milk became free from admixture. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
[hence] افصح signifies also (tropical:)  He spoke with<br>\
فَصَاحَة; (K, TA;) [i. e. clearness, perspicuousness, or distinctness; accord. to the explanation<br>\
of فصاحة in the K, and the usage of this verb in<br>\
numerous exs.; or with chasteness, or correctness;]<br>\
as also افصح الكَلَامَ and افصح بِهِ, and افصح<br>\
القَوْلَ; but when the verb became in frequent use,<br>\
and commonly known, the objective complement<br>\
became dropped, as in the case of أَحْسَنَ, &amp;c.:<br>\
(TA:) (assumed tropical:)  he spoke clearly, or plainly, (A, * K, *<br>\
TA,) to another; (A, TA;) without indistinctness, or without concealment: (TA:) [and] (tropical:)  he<br>\
(a foreigner) spoke Arabic: (S, A, Msb:) or<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  spoke Arabic correctly: (ISk, Msb:) [and] (assumed tropical:)  he<br>\
(a man of barbarous or vitious or indistinct speech)<br>\
spoke intelligibly. (L.) And one says, افصح فِى<br>\
مَنْطِقِهِ (tropical:)  He (a child) began to speak intelligibly.<br>\
(A, L.) And ↓ افصح فُلَانٌ ثُمَّ فَصُحَ (tropical:)  [He spoke<br>\
Arabic, and then became good in his language, or<br>\
dialect: so accord. to Er-Rághib, as cited in the<br>\
Mz, 9th نوع; in which it is said that some, but<br>\
not so correctly, use these two verbs in the converse manner: or he spoke clearly, or intelligibly,<br>\
and then became chaste, or good and correct, or<br>\
eloquent, in his speech, or language]. (A.) And<br>\
افصح is also used in poetry as signifying (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
(an animal not endowed with speech) uttered a<br>\
sound, or cry, clearly. (L.) And one says, افصح<br>\
عَنْ شَىْءٍ, inf. n. إِفْصَاحٌ [in this and the preceding<br>\
senses], meaning (tropical:)  He explained a thing. (A, *<br>\
TA.) And افصح عَنْ مُرَادِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He showed or revealed [his desire or his meaning]. (Msb.) ―<br>\

(TA.) [And said also of Jews, meaning They<br>\
celebrated the Passover: see الفِصْحُ.]<br>\
5<br>\
تفصّح (tropical:)  He affected (تَكَلَّفَ) the faculty, or<br>\
quality, of فَصَاحَة [q. v.] (S, A, TA) فِى كَلَامِهِ<br>\
[in his speech]; as also ↓ تفاصح: (S:) or he made<br>\
use of the faculty of فَصَاحَة: or, as some say, [but<br>\
accord. to general analogy, this signification seems<br>\
to belong more properly to ↓ تفاصح,] he affected<br>\
a resemblance to those endowed with that faculty;<br>\
[or made a show of فصاحة;] like تَحَلَّمَ as meaning “ he made a show of الحِلْم ” [i. e. “ forbearance,” &amp;c.; in which sense تَحَالَمَ is more commonly used]. (TA.) See also 1, latter part.<br>\

namely, a word, or phrase: and probably used<br>\

and from strangeness and from contrariety to<br>\
analogy not sanctioned by frequency of usage<br>\
among the Arabs of pure speech; (see فَصَاحَةٌ,<br>\
below:) or] of which the beauty is perceived by<br>\
hearing: (K:) and as applied to language in<br>\
general, [free from weakness of construction and<br>\
from incongruity of works, with فَصَاحَة (which<br>\
see again) in the words themselves:] as used by<br>\
the vulgar, it means in which the rules of desinential syntax are observed: syn. مُعْرَبٌ: (L;) [and<br>\
sometimes it means] eloquent; syn. بَلِيغٌ. [from<br>\

is enabled to express what he desires, with فَصَاحَة<br>\
(which see again) in languages or] clear, perspicuous, or distinct, in speech, or language; as<br>\
also ↓ فَصْحٌ; (K;) but this latter is an intensive<br>\
epithet, [being originally an inf. n.,] like عَدْلٌ:<br>\
(TA:) [and sometimes it signifies] eloquent; syn.<br>\
بَلَيغٌ [respecting which see what precedes]: (S, A:)<br>\
or مُنْطَلِقُ اللِّسَانِ [i. e. free from impediment of<br>\
the tongue, or eloquent, or chaste,] in speech, who<br>\
knows how to distinguish what is good in language<br>\
from what is bad: (TA;) the pl. as applied to<br>\
men is فُصَحَآءِ and فِصَاحٌ and فُصُحٌ, (K, TA,) the<br>\
last formed in the manner of the broken pl. of a<br>\

a quality of a word, and of language in general,<br>\
and of a speaker or writer, from the same word<br>\
as relating to milk, it signifies (tropical:)  Chasteness, as<br>\
meaning freedom from barbarousness: i. e.,] in a<br>\
word, freedom from an incongruous combination<br>\
of letters and from strangeness and from contrariety to analogy [not sanctioned by frequency<br>\
of usage among the Arabs of pure speech; (KT,<br>\
and Mz in the 9th نوع;) [for] the point upon<br>\
which it turns is the frequency of the use of a<br>\
word by the Arabs [of pure speech]; (Mz ibid.;)<br>\
a word being known to have this quality by its<br>\
being frequently used by the Arabs in whose<br>\
Arabic confidence is placed, or by its being used<br>\
by them more frequently than one synonymous<br>\
therewith: (El-Kazweenee in the “ Eedáh,” cited<br>\
in the same نوع of the Mz:) and in language [in<br>\
general], freedom from weakness of construction<br>\

desires, with فَصَاحَة in language: (KT:) or goodness and correctness in language, or dialect: (S:)<br>\
or clearness, perspicuousness, or distinctness, in<br>\
speech, or language: (K:) and [agreeably with<br>\
an explanation of فَصِيحٌ in the S and A &amp;c.] it is<br>\
sometimes used as meaning eloquence; syn. بَلَاغَةٌ<br>\
[from which it is properly distinct]. (MF.)<br>\
