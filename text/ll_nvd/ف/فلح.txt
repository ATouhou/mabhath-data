فَلَحَ, aor.<br>\
فَلَحَ, inf. n. فَلْحٌ, He clave, split, slit,<br>\
or cracked; and he cut: (K: [compare فَلَجَ, and<br>\
فَلَقَ, and فَلَذَ:]) he clave, and cut, iron. (T, Msb.)<br>\
Hence, the saying of a poet, (T, TA,)<br>\
إِنَّ الحَدِيدَ بِالحَدِيدِ يُفْلَحُ<br>\
Verily iron with iron is cloven, and cut. (T, S,<br>\
Mgh, * K. *) And فَلَحَ رَأْسَهُ, inf. n. as above, He<br>\
clave, split, or cracked, his head. (TA.) And<br>\
فَلَحَ شَفَتَهُ, aor. and inf. n. as above, He slit, or<br>\
cracked, his lip. (L.) And فَلَحَ الأَرْضَ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (Msb.) He furrowed, or ploughed, the land, to cultivate it; he<br>\
tilled the ground. (S, Msb. [And فَلَجَهَا has a<br>\
similar meaning.])<br>\
-A2-  Also, aor. and inf. n. as<br>\
above, He acted with artifice, fraud, or guile;<br>\
(K, TA;) and so ↓ فلّح, inf. n. تَفْلِيحٌ. (K, TA.)<br>\
You say, بِهِمْ ↓ فلّح He acted with artifice, fraud,<br>\
or guile, towards them, and said what was not true.<br>\
(TA.) And بِهِ ↓ فلّح He mocked at him, or<br>\
derided him, and acted with artifice, fraud, or<br>\

in the CK:) or he bade high for an article of<br>\
merchandise in order to inveigh another into purchasing it at a high price: syn. of the inf. n.<br>\
نَجْشٌ فِى بَيْعٍ. (So in other copies of the K, and<br>\
in the L and TA.) You say, فَلَحَ بِهِ [He so<br>\
acted towards him in a sale]: this is when one<br>\
trusts to thee, and says to thee, “Sell to me a<br>\
slave,” or “ an article of merchandise,” or “ buy<br>\
it for me,” and thou comest to the merchants,<br>\
and buyest it at a high price, and sellest by<br>\
defrauding, and obtainest something from the<br>\
merchant: or, accord. to the T, فَلْحٌ signifies a<br>\
hirer&#39;s exceeding [in an offer] in order that another<br>\
may do so; thus inciting him. (L.)<br>\

افلح He prospered; was successful; attained, or acquired, that which he desired or sought,<br>\
(MA, L, Msb,) or what was good, or felicity, or<br>\
that whereby he became in a happy and good<br>\
state: (L:) he was, or became, fortunate, happy,<br>\
or in a happy and good state. (MA.) It is commonly known as an intrans. verb; but Talhah<br>\
Ibn-Musarrif and &#39;Amr Ibn-&#39;Obeyd, read قَدْ<br>\
أُفْلِحَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ, [the first verse of ch. xxiii. of the<br>\
Kur-án,] with the verb in the pass. form. (MF.)<br>\
[See also 10.] ―<br>\

(??) وَقَدْ يُخَدَّعُ الأَرِيبُ<br>\

stupidity or by intelligence; for [one&#39;s object is<br>\
sometimes attained by stupidity, and the intelligent, or sagacious, is sometimes deluded, or much<br>\
deluded; or] the stupid is sometimes supplied with<br>\
the means of subsistence, and the intelligent is<br>\
[sometimes] denied: (T, L:) or the meaning is<br>\
prosper thou, &amp;c. (L.)<br>\
10<br>\
اِسْتَفْلِحِى بِأَمْرِكِ, said by a man to his wife,<br>\
(S,) a form of words used in divorcing (L, K)<br>\
in the Time of Ignorance, (L,) Prosper thou in<br>\
thy case, (AO, S, Mgh, TA,) and be independent<br>\
therein: (AO, Mgh, TA:) when a man says thus<br>\
to his wife and she consents, his saying so once<br>\
separates her from him so that he cannot take<br>\
her back: (L, from a trad.:) but as it is merely<br>\
an allusive expression, intention is necessary to<br>\
render it binding: as some relate the trad, it is<br>\
with ج [i. e. استفلجى: see art. فلج]. (MF.)<br>\
[See also 4, above.]<br>\
فَلْحٌ A fissure, cleft, slit, or crack: pl. فُلُوحٌ.<br>\

فَلَحٌ A fissure, or crack, in the under lip; (T,<br>\
K;) [or] ↓ فَلَحَةٌ has this meaning; (S;) or signifies the place of such a fissure or crack: (L:)<br>\
[or the former is a coll. gen. n.; and the latter,<br>\
its n. un.:] that which is in the upper lip is termed<br>\
عَلَمٌ: (T, TA:) or فَلَحٌ signifies a fissure, or<br>\
crack, in the lip: or, in the middle of the lip, less<br>\
than what is termed عَلَمٌ: or a slitting, or cracking, in the lip, such as happens to the lips of the<br>\
[Africans called] زَنْج. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And] The<br>\
having the under lip slit, or cracked. (S. [App.<br>\
an inf. n. of which the verb is ↓ فَلِحَ: like as it<br>\
is of فَلِحَت said of the under lip as mentioned<br>\
above.])<br>\
-A2-  See also فَلَاحٌ.<br>\
فَلَحَةٌ: see فَلَحٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A [field, or land, such<br>\
as is termed] قَرَاح, (AHn, L, K,) furrowed, or<br>\
ploughed, for cultivation: its pl., فَلَحَات, occurs<br>\

as others relate it, it is فَلَجَات, with ج.<br>\
(AHn, L.)<br>\

state, (A, L, K,) and in the enjoyment of ease,<br>\
comfort, or the blessings of life; and the continuance of good: (L:) and simply continuance,<br>\
permanence, lastingness, duration, or endurance.<br>\
(ISK, S, L.) There is not in the language of the<br>\
Arabs any word more comprehensive in its significations of what is good in the present life<br>\
and in the final state than الفَلَاحُ. (TA.) حَىَّ<br>\
عَلَى الفَلَاحْ, in the call to prayer, means Come<br>\
ye to the means of the attainment of Paradise,<br>\
and of permanence therein: (IAth, L:) or hasten<br>\
to the attainment of everlasting life: (L:) or<br>\
come to safety, or security: (S:) or come ye to<br>\
the way of safety and prosperity: (Msb:) or<br>\
come to the continuance of good. (L.) And you<br>\
say, لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ فَلَاحَ الدَّهْرِ I will not do that<br>\

وَلٰكِنْ لَيْسَ لِلدُّنْيَا فَلَاحُ<br>\

فِلَاحَةٌ, (thus in my copies of the S, and in the<br>\
L and Msb,) with kesr, (Msb,) [agreeably with<br>\
general analogy,] or ↓ فَلَاحَةٌ, with fet-h, (K, [but<br>\
I think that fet-h is here a mistake for kesr,<br>\
because فَلَاحَهٌ deviates from general analogy, and<br>\
because it is a general rule of the author of the<br>\
K to omit the mention of the vowel of a word<br>\
when it is fet-h,]) Agriculture; or the art, work,<br>\
or occupation, of ploughing, tilling, or cultivating,<br>\
land. (S, L, Msb, K.)<br>\

―<br>\
-b3-  And One who lets asses, or other beasts, on<br>\
hire; syn. مُكَارٍ: (T, K, TA:) so called as being<br>\
likened to the plougher, &amp;c., of land. (TA.)<br>\

أَفْلَحُ Having a fissure, or crack, in the under<br>\
lip: (S, Mgh:) or a man having what is termed<br>\
فَلَحٌ in his lip: fem. فَلْحَآءُ. (L.) &#39;Antarah El-<br>\
&#39;Absee was surnamed الفَلْحَآءُ because of a fissure<br>\
in his under lip; the fem. form of the epithet<br>\
being used because الشَّفَةُ (the lip) is fem.; (S,<br>\
L;) or because his name is fem. (L.) [See also<br>\
أَعْلَمُ.]<br>\
قَوْمٌ أَفْلَاحٌ [i. q. مُفْلِحُونَ] A people prospering;<br>\

رَجُلٌ مُتَفَلِّحُ الشَّفَةِ, and اليَدَيْنِ, and القَدَمَيْنِ,<br>\
A man having the lip chapped, or cracked, much,<br>\
by cold, and so the hands, and the feet. (L.) [See<br>\
also 5 in art. فلج.]<br>\
