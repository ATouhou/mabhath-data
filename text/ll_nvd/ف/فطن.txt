(Msb:) [and he understood, or knew, it; often used<br>\
in this sense:] and sometimes they said فَطَنَهُ,<br>\
making the verb trans. by itself, because it implies<br>\
the meaning of فَهِمَ; (TA;) or فَطَنْتُ الشَّىْءِ, with<br>\
fet-h, signifies I understood, or knew, the thing:<br>\
(S:) and some say that فَطَانَةٌ [as inf. n., agreeably with analogy, of فَطُنَ, which see in what<br>\

understand, except stones]. (TA.) And فطّنهُ<br>\

and the correcting him. (TA.)<br>\
