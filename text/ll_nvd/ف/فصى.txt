فَصَىَ الشَّىْءَ مِنَ الشَّىْءِ, (M, K,) or عَنِ الشَّىْءِ,<br>\
(Msb, and so in the TA,) improperly written in<br>\
the copies of the K فصا, (TA,) aor. يَفْصِيهِ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. فَصْىٌ, (M, Msb,) He separated the<br>\
thing from the thing; (M, K;) or removed it<br>\
therefrom: (Msb:) whence فصى اللحم عن العظم<br>\
[evidently meaning فَصَى الَّحْمَ عَنِ العَظْمِ i. e.<br>\
He separated, or removed, the flesh from the<br>\
bone]: (TA:) [but in both of my copies of the<br>\
S, I find فَصَىَ الَّحْمُ عَنِ العَظْمِ, as though فَصَى<br>\
were used as syn. with تفصّى and انفصى, meaning The flesh became freed, or cleared, from the<br>\
bone: perhaps a mistake of copyists; though it<br>\
is immediately added,] and مِنْهُ ↓ فَصَّيْتُهُ, inf. n.<br>\
تَفْصِيةٌ, i. e. I freed it, or cleared it, from it; (S,<br>\
K;) or, accord, to Fr, this signifies I separated<br>\
it from it, i. e., anything from another thing.<br>\

not on the ground of received usage, means He<br>\
separated himself from him; left, forsook, or<br>\
abandoned, him: or forsook, or abandoned, him,<br>\
being forsaken, or abandoned, by him, syn. فَارَقَهُ.<br>\

-b2-  افصى عنْكَ الحَرُّ means The heat<br>\
departed, or has departed, from thee: but you<br>\
do not say افصى عنك البَرْدُ: (ISk, S, M: but in<br>\
the M, عنك is omitted in both phrases:) or you<br>\
say, افصى عنَّا الشِّتَآءُ, and الحَرُّ, the winter, and the<br>\
heat, departed from as; or left, or quitted, us;<br>\
(K, TA;) so says Az, on the authority of IAar:<br>\
(TA:) or, accord, to IAar, افصى عَنْكَ الشِّتَآءُ [the<br>\
winter departed, or has departed, from thee];<br>\
and سقَطَ عَنْكَ الحرُّ. (M, TA.) And افصى المَطَرُ<br>\

تفصّى, said of flesh, or flesh-meat, It became<br>\

as also ↓ انفصى; (M;) which is said of anything<br>\
that was sticking. (Lth, TA.) He became freed,<br>\
free, or released, [and in like manner said of a<br>\
thing of any kind,] مِنْهُ [from him, or it]; S,<br>\
M, Msb, K;) i. e., from another man, (S,) from<br>\
his adversary, or antagonist; (Msb;) from a<br>\
thing; (M;) from debts; (S, Msb; *) from straitness, or difficulty, (S, Msb, TA,) or from trial, or<br>\
affliction; (S, TA;) or from good, or evil; as<br>\
also ↓ افصى (K.) And He, or it, went forth, or<br>\
departed, مِنَ الشَّىْءِ [from the thing]; as also<br>\
↓ انفصى, and ↓ استفصى. (Msb.) أَشَدُّ تَفَصِّيًا means<br>\
أَشَدُّتَفَلُّتًا: (Msb, TA:) thus in the trad. respecting the Kur-án, لَهُوَ إَشَدُّ تَفَصِّيًا مِنْ قُلُوبِ الرِّجَالِ<br>\
مِنَ النَّعَمِ [Verily it is more apt to escape from<br>\
the breasts of men than are pasturing camels, or<br>\
cattle, from their pastor]. (TA. [In my original,<br>\
the last word in this saying is without any vowel-sign; but it is not doubtful, as the trad. is well<br>\
known.])<br>\

raisins: (M, K:) also mentioned in the K [and<br>\
M] as with ض: (TA:) n. un. (??): (M, K:)<br>\
of the dial. of El-Hijáz: and they also call the<br>\
stones of dates فصية [app. (??), pl. of فَصى, like<br>\
as فِتْيَةٌ is pl. of فَتًى]. (TA.)<br>\
فَصْيَةٌ the subst, from تَفَصَّى as syn. with تَخلَّصَ;<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K;) [thus signifying Freedom. or<br>\
release, from a thing or state;] primarily denoting<br>\
one&#39;s being in a thing and then coming, or going,<br>\
forth, or departing, from it; (S;) as also ↓ فصيّةٌ.<br>\
(K.) Hence the saying, قَضَى اللّٰهُ لِى بِالفَصْيَةِ مِنْ<br>\
هٰذَا الأَمْرِ [God decreed for me, or may God<br>\
decree for me, freedom, or release, from this<br>\
affair, or case]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\

one of intermission, and a day &amp;c.], and لَيْلَةُ فَصْيَةٍ<br>\
