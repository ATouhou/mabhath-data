فَتَكَ بِهِ, (S, MA, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
فَتُكَ and<br>\
فَتِكَ,<br>\
inf. n. فَتْكٌ and فُتْكٌ and فِتْكٌ (S, O, Msb, K *)<br>\
and فُتُوكٌ (MA, K *) and فَتَاكَةٌ, (MA,) He<br>\
assassinated him; i. e. he came to him when he<br>\
(the latter) was inadvertent, and assaulted him<br>\
and slew him; (S, MA, * O;) thus it signifies<br>\
accord. to an explanation of الفَتْكُ by A&#39; Obeyd;<br>\
and this is the primary signification: (Az, TA:)<br>\
if he have not given him [for أَعْطَانَا in my original (an obvious mistranscription) I read أَعْطَاهُ]<br>\
assurance of safety, it behooves him to make that<br>\
known to him: (A&#39; Obeyd, TA:) he assaulted<br>\
him; or he slew him at unawares; and ↓ افتك is<br>\
a dial. var. thereof: (Msb:) he seized an opportunity that he (another) offered him (K, TA) by<br>\
his inadvertence, (TA,) and slew him: or he<br>\
wounded him openly: (K, TA:) or it has a more<br>\
general meaning with respect to both of these<br>\
acts: (K, * TA:) Fr says that الفَتْكُ signifies the<br>\
man&#39;s slaying openly. (TA.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
قَيَّدَ الإِيمَانُ الفَتْكَ لَا يَفْتُِكُ مُؤْمِنٌ [i. e. The giving<br>\
assurance of safety has inhibited (or, emphatically,<br>\
inhibits) the slaying at unawares, &amp;c.: one who<br>\
gives assurance of safety shall not slay at unawares,<br>\
&amp;c.: the like has been said above: see also an<br>\
explanation of the former clause of the trad. in<br>\
art. قيد]. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فَتَكَ, aor.<br>\
فَتُكَ and<br>\
فَتِكَ,<br>\
inf. n. فَتْكٌ and فُتْكٌ and فِتْكٌ (O, K) and فُتُوكٌ,<br>\
(K,) He purposed an affair and executed it: (O:)<br>\
or he embarked in, or performed, an affair that<br>\
occasioned uneasiness, and to which the mind invited; as also ↓ افتك: (K:) the latter verb is<br>\
said by Fr to be a dial. var. of the former. (O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] فَتَكَ فِى الأَمْرِ, (K, TA,) inf. n. فَتْكٌ,<br>\
(TA,) (tropical:)  He persisted, or persevered, in the affair;<br>\
syn. لَجَّ, or أَلَحَّ. (Accord. to different copies of<br>\
the K; in the TA the former. [The same meaning is also assigned to فَنَكَ.]) ―<br>\

what she did nor for what was said to her. (O,<br>\
K, TA.) [See also فَتَكَتْ.]<br>\
2<br>\
فَتَّكْتُ القُطْنَ, (IDrd, O,) inf. n. تَفْتِيكٌ,<br>\
(IDrd, O, K,) I separated, plucked asunder, or<br>\
loosened, the cotton: (IDrd, O, K: *) so in one<br>\

المُفَاتَكَةُ signifies المُمَاهَرَةُ; (O, K, TA;) so<br>\
says Ibn-&#39; Abbád, (O, TA,) and so Z; (TA;) i. e.<br>\
(tropical:)  The making a show of skill, one with another:<br>\
