in three places;) and it became unknit, or loosened,<br>\
said of a bone, and of a limb or member, and of<br>\
a joint; (see فَرِيجٌ, in two places; and see also<br>\
فَكِكْتَ, and اِنْفَكَّ in three places, and فَكَكٌ;)] syn.<br>\

calamities, there is, or shall be,] a removing, clearing away, or dispelling: (S, O, TA:) the last<br>\

which she fills up the space between her hind legs,<br>\

to expose; (S, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.;) applied to the<br>\
pudenda of men and of women and of youths, with<br>\
what is around them; and so of horses and the<br>\
like: (TA:) or the anterior pudendum [i. e. the<br>\
external portion of the organs of generation] of a<br>\
man and of a woman, by common consent of the<br>\
lexicologists; and applied to this and the posterior<br>\
pudendum [in the conventional language of the<br>\
law] because both belong to the same [legal] predicament [in certain cases]; (Mgh, Msb;) or<br>\
because each of them is a place of opening;<br>\

in common parlance it is mostly applied to the<br>\
anterior pudendum: (Msb:) or peculiarly, accord.<br>\
to some, the anterior pudendum of a woman [i. e.<br>\
the vulva, or external portion of the organs of<br>\

sorrow: (S, * O, * KL:) or i. q. رَاحَةٌ [i. e. rest,<br>\
repose, or ease; or cessation of trouble, or inconvenience, and of toil, or fatigue; or freedom therefrom]: (MA:) and ↓ فَرْجَةٌ and ↓ فُرْجَةٌ accord. to<br>\
ISk, and ↓ فِرْجَةٌ: also accord. to Az, signify the<br>\
same as فَرَجٌ: (Msb:) one says, مَا لِهٰذَا الغَمِّ مِنْ<br>\
↓ فَرْجَةٍ and ↓ فُرْجَةٍ and ↓ فِرْجَةٍ [There is not for<br>\
this grief any removal, or clearing away]: (T,<br>\
TA:) and ↓ لِكُلِّ غَمِّ فُرْجَةٌ i. e. كَشْفَةٌ [For every<br>\

Msb:) or ↓ فَرْجَةٌ relates to an affair or event; and<br>\
↓ فُرْجَةٌ, [which see expl. below,] to a wall, and a<br>\
door; but the two [primary] significations are<br>\
nearly the same: the authority for the three<br>\
[syn.] forms of the word is taken by the author<br>\
of the K from the statement in the T, cited<br>\
above, that one says, مَا لِهٰذَا الغَمِّ مِنْ فَرْجَةٍ and<br>\
فُرجَةٍ and فِرْجَةٍ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,] أُمُّ الفَرَجِ is<br>\

جذب]. (Har p. 227.)<br>\
فَرِجٌ (S, O, TA) and ↓ أَفْرَجُ (K, TA) A man<br>\

-b3-  And, as also ↓ فِرْجٌ, One who will<br>\
not conceal a secret: (O, K:) and ↓ فُرَجَةٌ a man<br>\
wont to reveal his secrets. (Ham p. 49.)<br>\
فَرْجَةٌ: see فَرَجٌ, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said in<br>\
the T, that أَدْرَكُوا القَوْمَ عَلَى فَرْجَتِهِمْ or ↓ فُرْجَتِهِمْ<br>\
occurs in a trad. as meaning على هزِيمَتِهِمْ [i. e.<br>\
They overtook the people, or party, in their state<br>\

حآء [app. قَرْحَتِهِمْ]. (TA.)<br>\

gap, or breach,] between two things; (Msb, TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ فَرْجٌ, (A,) of which the pl. is فُرُوجٌ only;<br>\
(TA;) [and so ↓ مَفْرَجٌ, lit. a place of opening,<br>\
occurring in the K in art. ودى, &amp;c.;] and<br>\
↓ مُنْفَرَجٌ: (JK and K voce خَلَلٌ, &amp;c.:) the pl.<br>\
of the first is فُرَجٌ (Msb, TA) and فُرُجَاتٌ: (TA:)<br>\
and it is also in a wall, (S, Msb, K,) and the like:<br>\
(S, Msb:) and signifies also an opening, or a<br>\
space, or room, made by persons for a man entering among them, in a place of standing or of sitting. (Msb.) One says, بَيْنَهُمَا فُرْجَةٌ, meaning<br>\
انْفِرَاجٌ [i. e. Between them two is an opening, or<br>\
intervening space, &amp;c.]. (S.) فُرَجُ الشَّيْطَانِ [The<br>\
Devil&#39;s gaps], occurring in a trad., means the gaps,<br>\
or unoccupied spaces, in the ranks of men praying<br>\
[in the mosque]. (L.) ―<br>\

-b2-  Also A ewe whose hips are<br>\
unknit, or loosened, [in the joints], (وَرِكَاهَا ↓ اِنْفَرَجَ<br>\

woman whose bones are unknit, or loosened,<br>\
(عِظَامُهَا ↓ اِنْفَرَجَتْ) in consequence of parturition:<br>\
and hence, as likened thereto, (tropical:)  a camel that is<br>\
fatigued, and drags his feet, or stands still: (Skr,<br>\
O:) or a woman fatigued in consequence of parturition: and hence, as being likened thereto, (tropical:)  a<br>\
she-camel that is fatigued. (Kr, TA.) And A<br>\
she-camel that has brought forth her first offspring. (O, K.) [See also فَارِجٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, accord.<br>\
to the K, [and the O as on the authority of Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád,] i. q. بَارِدٌ: but [SM says that] this is a<br>\
mistake for بَارِزٌ, meaning Uncovered, appearing,<br>\
or apparent; in which sense it is applied also to<br>\
a fem. noun: (TA:) it is applied, in a verse of<br>\
Aboo-Dhu-eyb, to a pearl (دُرَّة), as meaning<br>\
uncovered, and exposed to view, for sale. (O, TA.)<br>\
فَرَّاجٌ One who often removes, clears away, or<br>\

(K,) a dial. var., (S, O, TA,) mentioned by Lh:<br>\
(TA:) n. un. with ة: (S:) pl. فَرَارِيجُ. (S, Mgh,<br>\
O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, app., by a metaphorical application, (Mgh,) it signifies also A [garment of<br>\
the kind called] قَبَآءِ, (S, Mgh, O, K, [but omitted<br>\
in one of my copies of the S,]) having a slit in its<br>\
hinder part: (Mgh, O, K:) or the shirt of a<br>\
child: (O, K:) [but] the Prophet is related to<br>\
have prayed in a فرّوج (Mgh, TA) of خَزّ (Mgh)<br>\
or of silk; (TA;) or he pulled off one that he<br>\
had put on. (O.)<br>\

O, K,) or scarcely meet, (TA,) by reason of their<br>\

case among the Abyssinians. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also<br>\
فَرِجٌ.<br>\
تِفْرِجٌ, accord. to Akh, A beater and washer<br>\
and whitener of clothes; syn. قَصَّارٌ. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
also the next paragraph.<br>\
تِفْرِجَةٌ and ↓ تِفْرَاجٌ are sings. of تَفَارِيجٌ, (O,)<br>\
which signifies, (IAar, O, K,) as pl. of the first,<br>\
(K,) or of the second, (IAar, O,) The openings<br>\
[or interstices] of the fingers: (IAar, O, K:) and<br>\
the apertures, (IAar, O,) or clefts, (K,) of a railing: (IAar, O, K:) and also, (O, K,) accord. to<br>\
IDrd, as pl. of تِفْرِجَةٌ, (O,) the slits of the [kind<br>\

-A2-<br>\
تِفْرِجَةٌ as an epithet, applied to a man, signifies<br>\
Cowardly and weak; as also ↓ تِفْرَاجَةٌ; (O, K;)<br>\
and نِفْرَاجَآءُ, with ن, (O, * K,) mentioned by IAmb,<br>\
as imperfectly decl., and as signifying cowardly;<br>\
(O;) or so, accord. to the T and L, ↓ تِفْرِجٌ and<br>\
تِفْرِجَةٌ, and نِفْرِجٌ and نِفْرِجَةٌ: and the last two,<br>\
and نِفْرَاجٌ and نِفْرِجَآءٌ, all with ن, signify one who<br>\
becomes defeated, or put to flight, (يَنْكَشِفُ,) on the<br>\
occasion of war, or battle. (TA.)<br>\
تِفْرَاجٌ and تِفْرَاجَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مَفْرَجٌ: see فُرْجَةٌ. [Hence] مَفْرَجُ الغَمِ [The<br>\
place of opening of the mouth]. (TA in art. شجر.)<br>\
مَفَارِجُ [is its pl.; and] signifies Places of exit, or<br>\
egress. (TA.)<br>\
مُفْرَجٌ, occurring in the saying, in a trad., لَا<br>\
يُتْرَكُ فِى الإسْلَامِ مُفْرَجٌ, [meaning that he who is<br>\
thus termed shall not be left unbefriended among<br>\
the Muslims,] is variously explained: As used<br>\
to say that it is with ح; and disapproved of the<br>\
saying مفرج, with ج: A&#39;Obeyd says, I heard<br>\
Mohammad Ibn-El-Hasan say, it is related with<br>\
ح and with ج; and he who says مفرج, with ج,<br>\
means A slain person found in a desert tract, not<br>\
by a town or village, [which signification is mentioned in the K,] the fine for whose blood is to be<br>\
paid from the government-treasury: AO says that<br>\
it means one who becomes a Muslim and has no<br>\
alliance of friendship with any one [among the<br>\
Muslims]; wherefore, if he commits a crime,<br>\
[such as maiming another, &amp;c.,] the governmenttreasury must make amends for it, because he has<br>\
no relations or others bound to aid him by paying<br>\
a bloodwit [or the like]: (S, O: and the like is<br>\
also said in the Mgh and in the K:) or, accord.<br>\
to Jábir El-Joafee, it means a man who is among<br>\
a people to whom he does not belong; wherefore<br>\
they are bound to pay for him a bloodwit [or the<br>\
