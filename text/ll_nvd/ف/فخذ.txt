فَخَذَهُ, (S, O, L, K,) aor.<br>\
فَخَذَ, (TA, and so<br>\
accord. to some copies of the K, in which the<br>\
verb is said to be like مَنَعَهُ,) or<br>\
فَخِذَ, (so in other<br>\
copies of the K,) inf. n. فَخْذٌ, (L,) He hit, or<br>\
hurt, his (another&#39;s) thigh: (S, L, K:) or he<br>\
broke his thigh: like as one says رَأَسَهُ and رَجَلَهُ.<br>\
(O.) And فُخِذَ He was hit, or hurt, in his thigh:<br>\
(M, L, K:) or his thigh was broken. (A.)<br>\
2<br>\
فَخَّذَ see 5, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  فخّذ عَشِيرَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
called his عشيرة [or kinsfolk] فَخِذ by فَخِذ [i. e.<br>\
one small body of families after another], (S,<br>\
Mgh, * O, L, K, *) inf. n. تَفْخِيذٌ: (TA:) from a<br>\
trad. (S, O, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فَخَّذَهُمْ, inf. n. as above;<br>\
(K;) or فخّذ بَيْنَهُمْ; (L;) (assumed tropical:)  He dispersed them,<br>\
and abstained from aiding them; syn. فَرَّقَهُمْ<br>\
وَخَذَلَهُمْ: (L, K: [but see what follows:]) and<br>\
(L) فخّذهم (O, L, Msb) عَنْ فُلَانٍ, (O, L,) inf. n.<br>\
as above, (O, L, Msb,) signifies خذلهم, (L, Msb,<br>\
[in both written without any of the syll. signs,])<br>\
or خذّلهم عَنْهُ [which is evidently the right reading (i. e. he induced them to abstain from aiding<br>\
such a one), and I believe it to be the right reading also in the explanation given immediately<br>\
before from the L and K]: (O:) and فخّذ بَيْنَهُمْ<br>\
he dispersed them. (O, Msb.)<br>\
3<br>\
فَاْخَذَ see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
5<br>\
تفخّذ المَرْأَةَ He (a man, Msb) sat between<br>\
the thighs of the woman (Mgh, Msb) as he sits<br>\
who performs [or is about to perform] the act of<br>\
coïtus; as also ↓ فاخذها, [inf. n. مُفَاخَذَةٌ;] and<br>\
↓ فخّذها, inf. n. تَفْخِيذٌ: (Msb:) or he sat above<br>\
the thighs of the woman: (Mgh:) ↓ التَّفْخِيذُ signifies the same as ↓ المُفَاخَذَةُ [app. agreeably with<br>\
the former or the latter of the explanations above].<br>\
(S, O, L.)<br>\
-A2-  And تفخّذ He retired, or held back,<br>\
(O, K,) عَنِ الأَمْرِ from the affair. (O.)<br>\
10<br>\
استفخذ i. q. اِسْتَخْذَى, (Fr, O, K, TA,)<br>\
i. e. He was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive; and so اِسْتَخْذَأَ. (TA in arts. خذى and<br>\
خذأ.)<br>\
فَخِذٌ and فَخْذٌ (S, O, L, Msb, K) and فِخْذٌ (S,<br>\
O, L, K) and فِخِذٌ, (L, TA,) as Ez-Zarkashee<br>\
says in his Expos. of El-Bukháree, (TA,) for in<br>\
the case of every faucial medial radical of a word<br>\
of the measure فَعِل, whether a noun like فَخِذٌ or<br>\
a verb like شَهِدَ, there are four dial. vars., namely,<br>\
فَعِل and فَعْل and فِعْل and فِعِل; (Seer, O, TA;)<br>\
thus it is said in the Tes-heel of Ibn-Málik; and<br>\
MF says that the first three forms are common<br>\
to every word of the measure of كَتِف though<br>\
without a faucial letter; (TA;) The thigh; i. e.<br>\
the limb (وصل [i. e. وُِصْل, but in the O written<br>\
وَصْل,]) between the سَاق and the وَرِك; (Mgh, * O,<br>\
L, K; *) so says Lth; (O;) and in this sense,<br>\
the first of the forms above mentioned is the<br>\
most chaste: (MF:) it is of the fem. gender:<br>\
(Mgh, O, L, Msb, K:) pl. أَفْخَاذٌ, (Sb, L, Msb,<br>\
K,) the only pl. form. (Sb, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  A<br>\
small sub-tribe, or portion of the tribe, consisting<br>\
of the nearest of the kinsfolk of a man; (Kh, A, *<br>\
O, L, K; *) less than a بَطْن; the first [i. e.<br>\
largest] body being the شَعْب, then the قَبِيلَة, then<br>\
the فَصِيلَة, then the عِمَارَة, then the بَطْن, and then<br>\
the فَخِْذ: (S, O, L:) or it is below the قَبِيلَة but<br>\
above the بَطْن; and is pronounced with the خ<br>\
quiescent: (IDrd, O:) or below the فَصِيلَة but<br>\
above the بَطْن: (Msb:) or below the بَطْن and<br>\
above the فَصِيلَة: (Mgh, Msb:) this last, accord.<br>\
to IB and Aboo-Usámeh, is the true order; (TA<br>\
voce شعب, q. v.;) and AM says that the فَصِيلَة<br>\
is nearer than the فخذ: (L:) in this sense, the<br>\
second of the forms above mentioned is the most<br>\
chaste: (MF:) and in this sense it is of the<br>\
masc. gender; (A, Mgh, O, Msb;) because meaning نَفَرٌ; (Msb;) wherefore you say, هٰذَا فَخْذِى:<br>\
(A:) pl. as above. (A, O, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  حُلِبَتِ النَّاقَةُ<br>\
فِى فَخِذِهَا is a phrase mentioned by Fr, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [The she-camel was milked] in her half-month<br>\
[app. at the period commencing half a month<br>\
after her parturition]. (O.)<br>\
فَخْذَآءُ A woman that holds a man firmly between her thighs, (Msb, K, TA,) by reason of her<br>\
strength. (TA.)<br>\
مَفْخُوذٌ A man hit, or hurt, in his thigh: (M,<br>\
L:) or whose thigh is broken. (A.)<br>\
