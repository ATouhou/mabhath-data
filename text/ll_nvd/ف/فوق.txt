(S, O,) inf. n. فُوُوقٌ [or فُؤُوقٌ (S, O, K) and فُوَاقٌ.<br>\
(K,) said of a man, (S.) His spirit was about to<br>\

an arrow: (K, TA:) or its verb said of an<br>\
arrow, is فاق, aor. يَفَاقُ, inf. n. فَاقٌ and فَوْقٌ, in<br>\
which the و is then made movent with fet-h. [so<br>\
that the word becomes فَوقٌ,] because this verb is<br>\
of the class of فَعِلَ, aor. يَفْعَلُ: (K, TA.) or one<br>\
says of an arrow فَوِقَ, [aor يَفْوَقُ,] inf. n. فَوَقٌ,<br>\
meaning its notch broke: (Msb;) and ↓ انفاق said<br>\
of an arrow signifies thus; (S, Msb;) (??)<br>\

-b2-  And فُقْتُ السّهْم,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. فَوْقٌ, (Msb,) I broke the<br>\
notch of the arrow. (S, O, Msb, K.) And فاق<br>\
الشَّىْءَ, aor. يَفُوقُ, He broke the thing. (TA.)<br>\
-A5-<br>\
فاق in the sense of افتاق [from فَاقَةٌ] is not allowable. (S, O.)<br>\
2<br>\
فوّقهُ, inf. n. تَفْوِيقٌ, He made him, or judged<br>\
him, to excel, or to have excelled. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  فوّق<br>\
الفَصِيلَ, (S, O, K,) inf. n. as above, said of the<br>\
pastor, (TA,) He gave to the young unweaned<br>\
camel to drink the quantities of milk that had<br>\
collected in the udder between two milkings time<br>\
after time. (S, O, K, TA. [See فُوَاقٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
[hence] one says, ↓ فَوَّقَنِى الأَمَانِىَّ وَأَرْضَعَنِى أَفَاوِيقَ<br>\
بِرِّهِ (tropical:)  [He made me to obtain on repeated occasions<br>\
the things wished for, and nourished me with the<br>\
recurrent supplies of his bounty]. (TA.) And it<br>\
is said in a trad. of &#39;Alee, إِنَّ بَنِى أُمَيَّةَ لَيُفَوِّقُونَنِى<br>\
تُرَاثَ مُحَمَّدٍ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [Verily the sons of<br>\
Umeiyeh] give to me by little and little of the property [constituting the heritage of Mohammad].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 10.<br>\
-A3-  فوّق السَّهْمَ, (inf. n. as<br>\
above, Msb,) He made to the arrow a فُوق [i. e.<br>\
notch for the bow-string]. (S, O, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And [hence,] فوّق المَرْأَةَ (assumed tropical:)  He slit the vulva of the<br>\
woman. (TA in art. سوس.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also the next<br>\
paragraph, last sentence.<br>\
4<br>\
إِفَاقَةٌ, (O, K, TA,) some say, (O, TA,) signifies A resting; (O, K, TA;) from ↓ فُوَاقٌ signifying a resting between two milkings; (O, TA;)<br>\
which latter meaning, as well as the former, the<br>\
K erroneously assigns to the former word. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And أَفَاقَتْ said of a she-camel, signifies the<br>\
same as فَاقَتْ expl. above: see 1, latter half, (O,<br>\
K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence, perhaps,] افاق مِنْ<br>\
مَرَضِهِ, (S, O, K, TA,) and مِنْ سُكْرِهِ, (S, O,) and<br>\
مِنْ غَشْيَتِهِ, (O, TA,) inf. n. إِفَاقَهُ; (TA;) and<br>\
↓ استفاق; both signify the same; (S, O, K;) i. e.<br>\
He returned to a healthy, or sound, state [of body<br>\
and of mind, from his disease, and from his intoxication, and from his swoon, or fit of insensibility]: (O, K, TA:) or one says of the diseased,<br>\
افاق and ↓ استفاق meaning he became convalescent;<br>\
or recovered, but not completely, his health and<br>\
strength: and the subst. [or quasi-inf. n.] is ↓ فُوَاقٌ:<br>\
(TA:) and one says of the insane, or possessed,<br>\
افاق, inf. n. إِفَاقَةٌ, meaning he recovered his intel-ligence; and of the intoxicated, likewise, افاق,<br>\
originally افاق مِنْ سُكْرِهِ, like as one says اِسْتَيْقَظَ<br>\
مِنْ نَوْمِهِ: (Msb:) [and it is said that] ↓ الاِسْتِفَاقَةُ<br>\
as syn. with الإِفَاقَةُ is derived from فَوْق meaning<br>\
the contr. of تَحْت, like as تَعَلَّى مِنْ مَرَضِهِ and<br>\
تَمَاثَلَ are from العُلُوُّ and المُثُولُ: (Har p. 132:)<br>\
but accord. to &#39;Alee Ibn-&#39;Eesà, ↓ استفاق signifies<br>\
he sought, or desired, الإِفَاقَة. (Ham p. 541.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And [hence,] افاق الزَّمَانُ (tropical:)  The time became abundant in herbage after barrenness or drought. (O,<br>\
K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  أَفَقْتُ السَّهْمَ, (inf. n. إِفَاقَةٌ, Msb,) I<br>\
put the فُوق [or notch] of the arrow upon the bowstring, (S, O, Msb, * K,) to shoot with it; (S, O,<br>\
Msb;) as also أَوْفَقْتُهُ: but أَفْوَقْتُهُ is extr., (S, O,<br>\
K,) and should not be said, (S, O,) or, accord. to<br>\
Yoo, one says أَفْوَقْتُهُ also: (O:) and, accord. to<br>\
the A, السَّهْمَ ↓ فوّق signifies [in like manner] he<br>\
put the bow-string into the notch of the arrow on<br>\
the occasion of shooting. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تفوّق عَلَى قَوْمِهِ He exalted himself above his<br>\
people, or party. (O, * K, * TA.)<br>\
-A2-  تفوّق said<br>\
of a young unweaned camel, He drank [or<br>\
sucked] the quantities of milk that had collected<br>\
in the udder between two milkings time after time.<br>\
(S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And تَفَوَّقَهَا He milked her, namely,<br>\
a camel, drawing from her the quantities of milk<br>\
that had collected in her udder time after time;<br>\
(O, K;) as also ↓ استفاقها. (K. [But see this<br>\
latter below.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence the trad. respecting<br>\
Aboo-Moosà, that he was discoursing with<br>\
Ma&#39;ádh, of reciting the Kur-án, and said, أَمَّا أَنَا<br>\
فَأَتَفَوَّقُهُ تَفَوُّقَ اللَّقُوحِ [As for me, I draw it forth<br>\
in the manner of the drawing forth of the milk of<br>\
the milch camel at the times when it has collected<br>\
in her udder], meaning (tropical:)  I do not recite my set<br>\
portion at once, but piecemeal, in my night and<br>\
my day. (S, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  One says also تفوّق<br>\
شَرَابَهُ i. e. (tropical:)  He drank his wine, or beverage, part<br>\
after part. (TA.) Sb has mentioned that يَتَجَرَّعَهُ<br>\
and يَتَفَوَّقَهُ are said of that which is not a labouring to do a thing at once, but is an act after an<br>\
act, performed in a leisurely manner. (O, TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انفاق It (a thing) broke, or became broken;<br>\
quasi-pass. of فَاقَ الشَّىْءَ meaning كَسَرَهُ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, near the end. ―<br>\
-b3-  Said of a camel,<br>\
He became lean, or emaciated: ―<br>\
-b4-  and He<br>\
perished, or died. (O, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
افتاق He was, or became, poor, or in want,<br>\
or need: (S, O, Msb, K:) فَاقَ in this sense is<br>\
not allowable. (S, O.)<br>\
-A2-  And He died with<br>\
much فُوَاق [which may here mean either hiccoughing (which often occurs at the close of a<br>\
fatal fever &amp;c.), or gasping, or short catching of<br>\
the breath]. (O, K.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَفْوَقَ see 4, in four places.<br>\
-A2-  استفاقها: see 5.<br>\
[It signifies as there explained: or it signifies, or<br>\
signifies also,] He delayed the milking her, namely,<br>\
a camel, until her milk collected in her udder, or<br>\
in order that it might collect; and so ↓ فوّقها, inf. n.<br>\
تَفْوِيقٌ. (TA.) One says, اِسْتَفِقِ النَّاقَةَ Milk not<br>\
thou the she-camel before the time. (O, * K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And مَا يَسْتَفِيقُ مِنَ الشَّرَابِ He does not abstain<br>\
[from drinking wine]: (O, K, TA:) or he does<br>\
not drink it in the set time: or he does not appoint<br>\
a time for drinking it, but drinks it always.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
فَاقٌ A [large bowl such as is termed] جَفْنَة,<br>\
filled with food. (Lth, T, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  And Cooked<br>\
olive-oil. (O, K, TA.) So in the saying of Shemmákh, (O, TA, *) describing the hair of a woman,<br>\
(TA,)<br>\
قَامَتْ تُرِيكَ أَثِيثَ النَّبْتِ مُنْسَدِلًا<br>\
مِثْلَ الأَسَاوِدِ قَدْ مُسِّحْنَ بِالقَافِ<br>\
[She stood showing to thee hair abundant and<br>\
luxuriant, or abundant and long, in respect of<br>\
growth, let down, like the black serpents that have<br>\
been anointed with cooked olive-oil]: or, as some<br>\
say, meaning الأَنْفَاق, meaning fresh olive-oil [from<br>\
إِنْفَاق, a Pers. word signifying “ olive-oil ”]: or,<br>\
as AA relates it, the poet said, قَدْ شُدِّخْنَ بِالفَاقِ<br>\
[that have been crushed in the فاق]; and accord.<br>\
to him the last word has the meaning here next<br>\
following. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And The desert; syn.<br>\
صَحْرَآءُ: (O, K, TA:) so says AA: and on one<br>\
occasion he says that الفاق means a certain land:<br>\
(O: a meaning also mentioned in the K:) or a<br>\
certain wide land. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  It is also expl. as<br>\
signifying بَان [i. e. Oil of ben]: and also A<br>\
comb: on the authority of Th: and it may have<br>\
either of these meanings in the verse cited above.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A5-  And accord. to the K, it signifies Tall,<br>\
and incongruous in make; and so ↓ فُوقٌ and ↓ فُوقَةٌ<br>\
and ↓ فِيقٌ and ↓ فُوَاقٌ and ↓ فُيَاقٌ: but these words<br>\
are all correctly, in this [or a similar] sense with<br>\
two káfs. (TA.)<br>\
-A6-  Also, accord. to the K, A<br>\
certain aquatic bird, long in the neck: but this,<br>\
likewise, is correctly with two káfs. (TA.)<br>\
فَوْق is the contr. of تَحْت; (S, Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
K;) [primarily signifying The location that is<br>\
above, or over;] and is an adv. n. (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K) of place; (Mgh, Msb;) and a simple noun,<br>\
indecl., [with dammeh for its termination, when<br>\
the noun to which it should be prefixed is suppressed, and the meaning of this is intended to<br>\
be understood, but not the word itself;] but when<br>\
it is prefixed to another noun [which is either<br>\
expressed or itself (and not merely its meaning)<br>\
meant to be understood, and when the noun to<br>\
which it should be prefixed is suppressed and<br>\
neither this nor its meaning is meant to be understood,] it is declinable. (K. [For the words<br>\
يَكُونُ اسْمًا وَظَرْفًا مَبْنِىٌّ, the reading of the K in<br>\
the TA and CK, my MS. copy of the K (which<br>\
I follow in this case) has يكون ظرفا واسما مبنيّا.])<br>\
One says, زَيْدٌ فَوْقَ السَّطْحِ [Zeyd is above, or rather<br>\
upon, the house-top]. (Mgh, Msb.) And العِمَامَةُ<br>\
فَوْقَ الرَّأْسِ [The turban is above, or upon, the<br>\
head]. (Mgh.) And طَفَا فَوْقَ المَآءِ It floated upon<br>\
the water. (S &amp;c. in art. طفو.) Ks has mentioned<br>\
the saying, أَفَوْقَ تَنَامُ أَمْ أَسْفَلَ [Dost thou, or wilt<br>\
thou, sleep in the part that is above of the house<br>\
&amp;c., or in the part that is below? i. e., in the<br>\
upper part, or in the lower part?] with fet-h, as<br>\
suppressing the noun to which فوق is [meant to<br>\
be understood as] prefixed. (TA.) Lth says that<br>\
he who uses it as a صِفَة [by which (like other old<br>\
writers) he means an adv. n. of place] should use<br>\
the accus. case, as when one says, عَبْدُ اللّٰهِ فَوْقَ<br>\
زَيْدٍ [&#39;Abd-Allah is above Zeyd]: but if you make<br>\
it simply a noun, you use the nom. case, and say,<br>\
فَوْقُهُ رَأْسُهُ [His superior (meaning upper) part is<br>\
his head]; for in this instance it is the head itself,<br>\
and you make each to be governed in the nom.<br>\
case by the other. (TA.) In the saying in the<br>\
Kur [xvi. 28], فَخَرَّ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّقْفُ مِنْ فَوْقِهِمْ [And<br>\
the roof fell on them from above them], the<br>\
utility of the phrase من فوقهم is hardly apparent,<br>\
because عليهم sometimes serves in its stead: but<br>\
IJ says that من فوقهم may here have a useful<br>\
office; for عَلَى is sometimes used in relation to<br>\
deeds [or events] that are difficult, and deemed<br>\
onerous; [for instance,] you say, قَدْ سِرْنَا عَشْرًا<br>\
وَبَقِيَتْ عَلَيْنَا لَيْلَتَانِ [We have journeyed ten nights<br>\
and the journeys two nights have remained as<br>\
though incumbent on us]; &amp;c.; so that if it<br>\
were said فخرّ عليهم السقف without the adding<br>\
من فوقهم, it might be supposed to be like the<br>\
saying عَلَيْهِمْ دَارُهُمْ قَدْ خَرِبَتْ [Their abode had<br>\
become in a state of ruin as a punishment upon<br>\
them]; but when He [referring to God] says من<br>\
فوقهم, that meaning which was supposable ceases<br>\
to be so; and the meaning becomes this, that it<br>\
[the roof] fell when they were beneath it. (TA.)<br>\
إِذْ جَاؤُوكُمْ مِنْ فَوْقِكُمْ وَمِنْ أَسْفَلَ مِنْكُمْ [When<br>\
they came to you from above you and from below<br>\
you], in the Kur [xxxiii. 10], relates to Benoo-<br>\
Kureydhah, who came to them from above them;<br>\
and to Kureysh and Ghatafán, who came from<br>\
the district of Mekkeh, from below them. (TA.)<br>\
وَالَّذِينَ اتَّقُوا فَوْقَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ, in the Kur [ii. 208],<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  [But those who have been careful of their<br>\
religious duties] shall be above them in station [on<br>\
the day of resurrection]. (O.) And one says,<br>\
[agreeably with what has been stated in the first<br>\
sentence of this paragraph, أَخَذَهُ مِنْ فَوْقُ, and<br>\
أَخَذَهُ مِنْ فَوْقٍ, [meaning (assumed tropical:)  He overcame him, or<br>\
overpowered him, and in like manner أَتَاهُ من<br>\
فوق, as expl. in the Ham p. 128. i. e. قَهَرَهُ<br>\
namely, his adversary; and so a hawk, his pr?<br>\
or quarry. (M and K in an expl. of أَدَلَّ عَلَيْه, in<br>\
art. دل.) And [in a similar manner] فَوْق is metaphorically used as denoting excess, (Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
and excellence: (Msb:) thus one says, العَشَرَةُ فَوْقَ<br>\
التِّسْعَةِ (Mgh, Msb) i. e. (tropical:)  Ten is above nine;<br>\
meaning ten exceeds nine: (Msb:) and هٰذَا فَوْقَ<br>\
ذَاكَ (Mgh, Msb) i. e. (tropical:)  [This is above, or superior<br>\
to, that;] meaning this is more excellent than that;<br>\
(Msb:) and hence, (Mgh, Msb,) in the Kur iii.<br>\
24], (S, O,) بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا i. e. (tropical:)  [A gnat and]<br>\
what exceeds it (Mgh, Msb) in smallness, or in<br>\
largeness; (Mgh, Msb, K;) what is smaller than<br>\
it, (AO, S, O,) or what is larger than it, by the<br>\
latter being meant the fly [mentioned in the Kur<br>\
xxii. 72] and the spider [mentioned in xxix. 40],<br>\
(Fr, S, O,) and the phrase as expl. in the former<br>\
sense being like the reply to him who says “ Such<br>\
a one is small ” ذٰلِكَ وَفَوْقَ i. e. (assumed tropical:)  And smaller than<br>\
that: (AO, O:) hence also, in the Kur iii. 12],<br>\
فَإِنْ كُنَّ نِسَآءً فَوْقَ اثْنَتَيْنِ (Mgh, Msb) i. e. (tropical:)  [And<br>\
if they are women,] exceeding two. (Msb.)<br>\
فُوقٌ The part, of the arrow, which is the place<br>\
of the bow-string; [i. e. the notch thereof;] (S,<br>\
O, Msb, K;) as also ↓ فُوقَةٌ: (Msb, K;) the<br>\
former is masc., and also, like the latter, fem.<br>\
(IAmb, Msb:) and الفُوقَانِ signifies the (??)<br>\
[or two cusps of the فُوق, between which is put the<br>\
bow string]; (O, K;) thus these are termed by<br>\
the tribe of Hudheyl; but a poet who has used<br>\
the dual form is said by AO to has mead<br>\
thereby a single فُوق: (O:) the pl. [of mult.] is<br>\
فُوَقٌ and [of pauc.] أَفْوَاقٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;) or,<br>\
accord. to ISk, these are pls. of فُوقَةٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and قُفًا also is a pl., formed by transposition;<br>\
[see an ex. in a verse cited voce عُرْقُوبٌ;] (K,<br>\
TA;) one says فُقْوَةٌ and فُقًا [for فُوقَةٌ and فُوَقٌ].<br>\
(TA.) سَهْمٌ ذُو فُوقٍ means An arrow rendered<br>\
complete by its having a فُوق: ―<br>\
-b2-  and hence ذَا<br>\
فُوقٍ occurring in a trad. [as meaning (assumed tropical:)  A complete share; for سَهْمٌ signifies “ a share ” as well<br>\
as “ an arrow ”]. (A&#39;Obeyd, O.) And أَعْلَاهُمْ<br>\
فُوقًا, meaning (tropical:)  He, or they, of them, haring the<br>\
largest share of religion, is a metaphorical phrase,<br>\
from the فُوق of the arrow. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And they<br>\
say, أَقْبِلْ عَلَى فُوقِ نَبْلِكَ, [or, app., فُوَقِ نَبْلِكَ, for<br>\
نَبْلٌ is a coll. n., meaning “ arrows,” or “ Arabian arrows,”] meaning (assumed tropical:)  Betake thyself to thy<br>\
affair, and that which concerns thee. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\

cogged محالة,] has two cusps (فُوقَانِ), (O, K,)<br>\
like the فوقان [of the notch] of the arrow. (O.)<br>\
[The strangeness of this explanation induces me<br>\
to think that فَوْقَآءُ is here a mistranscription for<br>\
فَوْهَآءُ, (see مَحَالَةٌ فَوْهَآءُ, in art. فوه,) and that the<br>\
