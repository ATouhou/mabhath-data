فَزِعَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) and فَزَعَ, (K,) aor.<br>\
فَزَعَ,<br>\
of the former verb, (Msb, K,) and of the latter<br>\
also, (K,) inf. n. فَزَعٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) which is<br>\
of the former verb, (S, * O, Msb, TA,) and [of<br>\
the latter verb] فَزْعٌ [فَزَعًا in the CK being a mistake for فَزْعًا] and ?? (K, TA,) He feared; or<br>\
was, or became, in fear, afraid, frightened, or terrified; (S, O, Msb, K, TA;) and so ↓ تفزّع: (TA<br>\
in art. روع:) you say, فَزِعَ مِنْهُ he feared him, or<br>\
it; or was, or became, in fear, &amp;c., of him, or it:<br>\
(MA, Msb, TA:) accord. to Er-Rághib, فَزَعٌ signifies a shrinking, and an aversion, that comes<br>\
upon a man, from a thing causing fear or fright;<br>\
and is a kind of جَزَع [q. v.]; and one should not<br>\
say فَزِعْتُ مِنَ اللّٰهِ like as one says خِفْتُ مِنْهُ: or,<br>\
as Mbr says, in the “ Kámil,” its primary signification is the fearing, or being in fear or afraid<br>\
or frightened or terrified: then, by a metonymical<br>\
application, it signifies a people&#39;s going forth<br>\
quickly to repel an enemy, or the like, that has<br>\
come upon them suddenly; and this meaning has<br>\
become [conventionally regarded as] proper.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  فَزَعٌ signifies also The seeking, or demanding, aid, or succour: (Az, K, TA:) and the<br>\
aiding, or succouring; (Az, S, O, K, TA;) this<br>\
latter being likewise a signification of ↓ إِفْزَاعٌ: (S,<br>\
O:) an ex. of the former word (S, O, TA) in the<br>\
latter sense (O, TA) occurs in the saying of the<br>\
Prophet to the Ansár, إِنَّكُمْ لَتَكْثُرُونَ عِنْدَ الفَزَعِ<br>\
وَ تَقِلُّونَ عِنْدَ الطَّمَعِ [Verily ye are many on the<br>\
occasion of aiding, or succouring, and ye are few<br>\
on the occasion of coveting, or greed]; (S, O, TA;)<br>\
or in this saying the implied meaning may be, on<br>\
the occasion of men&#39;s betaking themselves to you in<br>\
fear (عِنْدَ فَزَعِ النَّاسِ إِلَيْكُمْ) in order that ye may<br>\
aid or succour them [which is virtually the same<br>\
as their seeking your aid or succour]: (TA:) thus<br>\
[it is said] فَزَعٌ has two contr. significations: (K:)<br>\
and both of these significations are expressed by<br>\
the verb فَزِعَ: (O:) you say فَزِعَ إِلَيْهِ and فَزِعَ<br>\
مِنْهُ; (K in continuation of what has been last<br>\
cited therefrom above, and TA; [app. meant to<br>\
indicate that both of these phrases signify he<br>\
sought, or demanded, aid, or succour, of him;<br>\
and he aided, or succoured, him; or that the<br>\
former phrase has the former signification; and<br>\
the latter phrase, the latter signification; though<br>\
accord. to the TK, both phrases have the former<br>\
signification, and the former phrase has also the<br>\
latter signification;]) but you should not say فَزَعَهُ,<br>\
(K, TA,) i. e. like مَنَعَهُ: (TA:) [or] from الفَزَعُ<br>\
as signifying “ fear,” or “ fright,” you say فَزِعْتُ<br>\
إِلَيْكَ and فَزِعْتُ مِنْكَ; [app. meant to indicate that<br>\
the former phrase signifies I betook myself to thee<br>\
in fear, which is a meaning thereof well known,<br>\
and nearly agreeing with an explanation of the<br>\
verb followed by إِلَيْهِ which will be found below<br>\
in this paragraph; and that the latter phrase signifies I feared thee, or I was, or became, in fear,<br>\
&amp;c., of thee, the only meaning, of this phrase, for<br>\
which I find any explicit authority, and one for<br>\
which I have given three authorities in the first<br>\
sentence of this art.;] but you should not say<br>\
فَزِعْتُكَ: (S: [thus in my copies, فَزِعْتُكَ, not<br>\
فَزَعْتُكَ:]) or فَزِعَ إِلَيْهِمْ signifies he sought, or<br>\
demanded, of them, aid, or succour; and فَزَعَهُمْ<br>\
and فَزِعَهُمْ signify he aided, or succoured, them,<br>\
syn. أَغَاثَهُمْ [in the CK اَعانَهُمْ] and نَصَرَهُمْ, like<br>\
↓ أَفْزَعَهُمْ: (K, TA:) accord. to IB, فَزِعْتُهُ meaning<br>\
أَغَثْتُهُ is originally فَزِعْتُ له [primarily signifying<br>\
I feared, or became in fear &amp;c., for him]; then<br>\
the ل was dropped; for one says فَزِعْتُهُ and فَزِعْتُ<br>\
لَهُ: (TA:) or فَزِعَ, like فَرِحَ, signifies اِنْتَصَرَ: (K:<br>\
[thus in the copies of the K, and hence in the TA,<br>\
app. a mistranscription for اِسْتَنْصَرَ, he sought, or<br>\
demanded, aid, or aid against an enemy:]) and<br>\
فَزِعَ إِلَيْهِ he betook himself, or had recourse, to him,<br>\
or it, for refuge, protection, or preservation, (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K, TA,) by reason of fear, or fright, (S,)<br>\
and sought, or demanded, aid, or succour, by him,<br>\
or it; whence, in a trad. respecting the eclipse of<br>\
the sun, فَافْزَعُواإِلَى الصَّلَاة i. e. Then betake yourselves, &amp;c., to prayer, and seek, or demand, aid,<br>\
or succour, by it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  فَزِعَ مِنْ نَوْمِهِ means<br>\
He became roused from his sleep; (O, K;) because he who is roused is not free from some fear,<br>\
or fright: occurring in a trad. in this sense. (O.)<br>\
And one says, فَزِعْتُ بِمَجِىْءِ فُلَانٍ, meaning I<br>\
prepared [or roused] myself by reason of the<br>\
coming of such a one, by a change of state, or<br>\
condition, like as the sleeper passes from the state<br>\
of sleeping to that of waking. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  فَزَعَهُ in<br>\
the phrase فَفَزَعَهُ ↓ فَازَعَهُ means He exceeded him<br>\
in fear, or fright. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  فُزِعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ: see<br>\
the next paragraph.<br>\
2<br>\
فزّعهُ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  [It also app. signifies He<br>\
made a fearful event, or fearful events, to befall<br>\
him: see its pass. part. n. below.] ―<br>\
-b3-  فَزَّعَ عَنْهُ<br>\
He removed from him fear, or fright: (O, in two<br>\
places:) it is implied by the context in the K that<br>\
عنه ↓ افزع has this meaning; but in the O and<br>\
other lexicons it is فَزَّعَ. (TA.) And فُزِّعَ عَنْهُ,<br>\
(S, K,) inf. n. تَفْزِيعٌ, (K,) Fear, or fright, was<br>\
removed from him. (S, K.) It is said in the<br>\
Kur [xxxiv. 22], حَتَّى إِذَافُزِّعَ عَنْ قُلُوبِهِمْ, meaning Until, when fear, or fright, shall be removed<br>\
from their hearts: (S, O:) this is the common<br>\
reading: another reading is فَزَّعَ, i. e. فَزَّعَ اللّٰهُ:<br>\
and El-Hasan reads ↓ فُزِعَ: and he says that in<br>\
this reading and the first, the prep. with its noun<br>\
are [regarded as supplying the place of the agent<br>\
and therefore virtually] in the nom. case, as in<br>\
the phrase سِيرَ عَنِ البَلَدِ: (TA:) some read فُرِّغَ<br>\
[q. v.]: (O and TA in art. فرغ:) and &#39;Eesà Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Omar is related to have read إِذَا افْرَنْقَعَ. (TA in<br>\
art. فرقع.)<br>\
3<br>\
فازعهُ فَفَزَعَهُ [He vied with him in fear, or<br>\
fright,] and he exceeded him therein. (TA. See<br>\
1, last sentence but one.)<br>\
4<br>\
افزعهُ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. إِفْزَاعٌ, (S, O,) He<br>\
made him to fear, or to be afraid; frightened<br>\
him; or terrified him; (S, * O, * Msb, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ فزّعهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَفْزِيعٌ. (S, O.)<br>\
And you say, يُفْزَعُ مِنْهُ [One is made to fear, or<br>\
be afraid of, or is frightened, or terrified, at, it,<br>\
or him], (S, O, K,) and مِنْ أَجْلِهِ [on account of<br>\
him, or for the sake of him], (O, K,) and بِهِ [by<br>\
him, or by means of him]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] He<br>\
housed him from his sleep. (K, TA. [See 1, last<br>\
quarter.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also He aided, or succoured, him.<br>\
(S, K.) See 1, former half; and again, in the<br>\
latter half. ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 2.<br>\

تَفَزَّعَ see 1, first sentence.<br>\
فَزَعٌ Fear, or fright: (S, O, K:) originally (S)<br>\
an inf. n.; but notwithstanding this, (S, * O, K,)<br>\
sometimes, (S, O,) having a pl., which is أَفْزَاعٌ.<br>\
(S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And, as seems to be indicated by<br>\
an explanation of مُفَزَّعٌ (q. v.), A fearful event:<br>\
pl. as above.]<br>\
فَزِعٌ Fearing; being afraid or frightened or<br>\
terrified; (Er-Rághib, MA, Msb, TA;) thus in<br>\
a verse cited voce ظُنْبُوبٌ; (Er-Rághib, TA;) and<br>\
↓ مُفَازِعٌ is syn. therewith: (O, K:) and one says<br>\
also ↓ رَجُلٌ فَازِعٌ, pl. فَزَعَةٌ; and ↓ مَفْزُوعٌ; meaning<br>\
a man put in fear; made afraid; frightened, or<br>\
terrified. (TA.) And In a state of disquiet, disturbance, or agitation: whence an extraordinary<br>\
reading, of four readers, in the Kur xxviii. 9, [i. e.<br>\
فَزِعًا] for فَارِغًا, relating to the heart of the mother<br>\
of Moses, meaning in a state of disquiet, &amp;c.,<br>\
almost quitting its pericardium. (TA.) It has no<br>\
broken pl.; its only pl. being فَزِعُونَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also Seeking, or demanding, aid, or succour; and<br>\
Sgh thus explains it [in the O] as used in the verse<br>\
above mentioned; but Er-Rághib says that this<br>\
is an explanation of the intended meaning, not of<br>\
the literal signification: (TA:) and it has also the<br>\
contr. meaning, aiding, or succouring; thus being<br>\
trans., though of the measure فَعِلٌ; but it may be<br>\
altered from ↓ فَازِعٌ, like as حَذِرٌ is [said to be]<br>\
altered from حَاذِرٌ. (IB, TA,)<br>\
فَزْعَةٌ: see فَزَعَةٌ.<br>\
فُزْعَةٌ A man whom one is made to fear, of whom<br>\
one is made afraid, or at whom one is frightened:<br>\
(O, K:) [like مَفْزَعَةٌ as expl. by Lth and others:]<br>\
and by whom, or by means of whom, one is made<br>\
afraid, or frightened. (O.)<br>\
فَزَعَةٌ sing. of فَزَعَات in the phrase فَزَعَاتُ الرُّوعِ<br>\
[app. meaning The fears, or frights, of the heart].<br>\
(TA. [The sing., as well as the pl., is there said<br>\
to be thus, بِالتَّحْرِيك; but if the former be, as<br>\
I think it is, an inf. n. un., it should by rule be<br>\
↓ فَزْعَةٌ.])<br>\
فُزَعَةٌ One who fears men, or is frightened at<br>\
them: (K:) or one who fears, or is frightened,<br>\
much, or often; (O;) [and] so ↓ فَزَّاعَةٌ. (TA.<br>\
[But see what next follows.])<br>\
فَزَّاعَةٌ One who makes men to fear, or frightens<br>\
them, much, or often. (O, K.) See also فُزَعَةٌ.<br>\
فَازِغٌ: see فَزِعٌ, in two places.<br>\
مَفْزَعٌ i. q. مَلْجَأْ [as meaning A refuge, i. e. a<br>\
place to which, or a person to whom, one betakes<br>\
himself, or has recourse, for refuge, protection, or<br>\
preservation,] (S, O, Msb, K, TA,) on the occasion of the befalling of an affliction or a calamity;<br>\
(TA;) applied to a sing. and a pl. (S, O, K) and<br>\
a dual (S, O) and a masc. and a fem.; (S, O, K;)<br>\
one says, فُلَانٌ مَفْزَعٌ لِلنَّاسِ Such a one is a refuge<br>\
to men when an event comes upon them suddenly,<br>\
and هُمَامَفْزَعٌ لِلنَّاسِ, and هُمْ مَفْزَعٌ, &amp;c.; (S, O;)<br>\
and ↓ مَفْزَعَةٌ is the same in signification and in its<br>\
applications; (K;) expl. by IF as signifying a<br>\
place to which one who is in fear, or frightened,<br>\
betakes himself, or has recourse, for refuge, protection, or preservation: (TA:) or مَفْزَعٌ signifies<br>\
one of whom aid, or succour, is sought, or demanded: (K:) and ↓ مَفْزَعَةٌ, [a cause of fear or<br>\
fright; being a word of the class of مَبْخَلَةٌ and<br>\
مَجْبَنَةٌ; i. e.] a thing that one is made to fear, or<br>\
at which one is frightened; (S;) or a person whom<br>\
one is made to fear, or at whom one is frightened;<br>\
[like فُزْعَةٌ;] or on account of whom, or for the sake<br>\
of whom, one is made to fear, or is frightened:<br>\
(Lth, O, K:) you say, فُلَانٌ لَنَا مَفْزَعَةٌ [Such a<br>\
one is to us a person whom we are made to fear,<br>\
&amp;c.], and in like manner you say of a female, and<br>\
of a pl. number. (O.)<br>\
مَفْزَعَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
مُفَزَّعٌ Cowardly; (Fr, O, K;) as being made<br>\
to fear, or to be frightened at, everything: (Fr,<br>\
O:) and courageous; (Fr, O, K;) as being one<br>\
the like of whom fearful events are made to befall<br>\
(بِمِثْلِهِ تُنْزَلُ الأَفْزَاعُ). (Fr, O. [But what here<br>\
follows suggests another reason, and I think a<br>\
better, for the latter meaning.]) مُفَزَّعَةٌ applied by<br>\
&#39;Amr Ibn-Maadee-Kerib as an epithet to his اِسْت,<br>\
in replying to a threat of El-Ash-&#39;ath, who had<br>\
said to him, لَوْ دَنَوْتَ لَأُضَرِّطَنَّكَ, means Secure<br>\
from being overcome by fear, or fright, and<br>\
[therefore] not lax so as to break wind [in consequence of fear]; being from فَزَّعَ عَنْهُ meaning<br>\
“ he removed fear, or fright, from him; ” or it<br>\
may be for the same reason as that for which<br>\
مُفَزَّعٌ is applied to a courageous man. (O.)<br>\
