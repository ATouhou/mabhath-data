فَلَذَ, aor.<br>\
فَلِذَ, inf. n. فَلْذٌ, He cut, or cut off.<br>\
(Msb.) One says, فَلَذَ لَهُ قِطْعَةً مِنَ المَالِ He cut<br>\
off for him a portion of the property: (T:) and<br>\
فَلَذْتُ لَهُ مِنْ مَالِى, (S, M, O, L,) aor. as above,<br>\
(M, L,) and so the inf. n., (M, L, K,) I cut<br>\
off for him [a portion] of my property: (S, O,<br>\
L:) or gave him [a portion] of it at once: or<br>\
gave him [a portion] of it without delay, and<br>\
without promising: or gave him much thereof.<br>\
(M, L, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next paragraph, in<br>\
two places.<br>\

فلّذ, (T, L,) inf. n. تَفْلِيذٌ; (T, O, L, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ فَلَذَ, inf. n. فَلْذٌ; (L, TA;) He cut in<br>\
pieces (T, O, L, K) flesh-meat. (T, L.) Hence,<br>\
in a trad., كَبِدَهُ ↓ إِنَّ الفَرَقَ مِنَ النَّارِ فَلَذَ [Verily<br>\
the fear of the fire of Hell cut in pieces his liver;<br>\
but perhaps فَلَذَ is here a mistranscription for<br>\
فَلَّذَ]; said, by the Prophet, of one who had died<br>\
from fear of the fire [of Hell]. (L.)<br>\
3<br>\
فالذ النِّسَآءَ, inf. n. مُفَالَذَةٌ, He bandied words,<br>\
or held colloquies, with women. (O, * K.) One<br>\
says, فُلَانٌ ذُو مُطَارَحَةٍ وَمُفَالَذَةٍ Such a one has a<br>\
habit of bandying words, &amp;c., with women. (K, *<br>\
TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
افتلذ مِنْهُ قِطْعَةً مِنَ المَالِ He cut off, or<br>\
took, for himself, from him, a part, or portion,<br>\
of the property. (T.) And اِفْتَلَذْتُ مِنْهُ حَقِّى I<br>\
cut off, or took, for myself, from him, my right,<br>\
or due. (A, TA.) And افْتَلَذْتُهُ المَالَ I took from<br>\
him a part, or portion, of the property. (S, O,<br>\
L, K.)<br>\
فِلْذٌ The liver of a camel: (S, M, O, L, K:)<br>\
pl. أَفْلَاذٌ [also said to be a pl. of فِلْذَةٌ, q. v.]. (S,<br>\
M, O, L.)<br>\
فِلْذَةٌ A piece, or portion, of liver, (S, M, O, L,<br>\
K,) cut in an oblong from, (O,) and of flesh-meat,<br>\
(S, O, L, K,) and of property, (S, O, L,) and of<br>\
gold, and of silver, (M, L, K,) &amp;c.: (S, O, Msb:)<br>\
a piece of flesh-meat cut in an oblong form: (As,<br>\
T, M, L:) pl. [of mult.] فِلَذٌ (T, S, L, K) and<br>\
[of pauc.] أَفْلَاذٌ, (T, M, L, K,) the latter irregular,<br>\
as though the augmentative letter [in the sing.]<br>\
were elided; or فِلْذٌ may be a dial. var. of فِلْذَةٌ,<br>\
and so this pl. may be regular. (M, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَفْلَاذُ<br>\
الأَرْضِ, (M, L, K,) or أَفْلَاذُ كَبِدِ الأَرْضِ, occurring<br>\
in a trad., (As, T, A, L,) relating to the signs of<br>\
the day of resurrection, accord. to different relations thereof, (L,) means (tropical:)  The buried treasures<br>\
of the earth, (As, T, M, L, K,) and its riches.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And أَفْلَاذُ كَبِدِ مَكَّةَ means (tropical:)  The principal and choicest persons of the inhabitants of<br>\
Mekkeh; of the tribe of Kureysh: so called<br>\
because the liver is one of the noble parts of the<br>\
body. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  الفِلَذَاتُ [(not to be mistaken for<br>\
الفِلِزَّاتُ) is a pl. of الفِلْذَةُ, and] signifies الأَجْسَامُ<br>\
السَّبْعَةُ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  The seven material substances;<br>\
namely, the four elements, (fire, air, earth, and<br>\
water,) and the three products composed of these<br>\
(which are minerals, vegetables, and animals)].<br>\
(MF. [But in the copy of his work which I use,<br>\
الاجساد is erroneously put for الجسام.])<br>\
فَالُوذٌ (T, S, M, O, L, K) and ↓ فَالُوذَقٌ, but,<br>\
accord. to Yaakoob, not ↓ فَالُوذَجٌ, (S, O, L,) or<br>\
this is the proper form, because the ه in the<br>\
original Pers. word is regularly changed into ج,<br>\
(MF,) [the word being] arabicized, (T, S, O, L,)<br>\
from the Pers. (M, O, * L) بَالُودَه [or فَالُودَه or<br>\
پَالُودَه], (O,) A kind of sweet food, (M, O, * L, K,)<br>\
well known, (K,) prepared of the purest substance<br>\
of wheat (لُبّ الحِنْطَة), (T, L,) or of starch, (TA<br>\
in art. نشو,) [with water and honey:] pl. فَوَالِيذُ<br>\
[of which see an ex. in the next paragraph]. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q. فُولَاذٌ, q. v. (M, L, K.)<br>\
فُولَاذٌ, (T, M, O, L, Msb, K,) an arabicized<br>\
word, (T, O, Msb,) from the Pers. بُولَاد [or فُولَاد<br>\
or پُولَاد], (O,) and ↓ فَالُوذٌ also, (M, L, K,) Steel;<br>\
i. e. purified and refined iron; or the pure part<br>\
of iron; (T, M, O, L, Msb, K;) which is added<br>\
in other iron: (M, L:) pl. فَوَالِيذُ. (A.) One<br>\
says, الضَّرْبُ بِالفَوَالِيذِ خَيْرٌ مِنَ الضَّرَْبِ فِى الفَوَالِيذِ<br>\
[The smiting with the weapons of steel in battle is<br>\
better than the thick white honey in the sweet<br>\
messes of the kind called فالوذ]. (A.)<br>\
فَالُوذَجٌ and فَالُوذَقٌ: see فَالُوذٌ, above.<br>\
مَفْلُوذٌ A sword made of فُولَاذ [i. e. steel].<br>\
