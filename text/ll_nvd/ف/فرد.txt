-b2-  أَفْرَدَتْ She (a<br>\
female, S, L, a pregnant female, A, or a woman,<br>\
K) brought forth one only: (S, A, L, K:) opposed<br>\
to أَتْأَمَتْ: (A:) not said of a she-camel, because<br>\
she never brings forth more than one. (S, L, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  افردهُ He made him, or it, to be single; sole;<br>\
or one, and no more. (Lth, T, M, * L, Msb. *) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And He put, or set, him, or it, apart, aside, or<br>\
away; he separated him, or it. (S, K.) You<br>\
say, افردهُ مِنْهُ [He separated him from him, and<br>\
rendered him solitary; or he left him solitary].<br>\
(A and Mgh in art. وتر.) [See an ex. in a verse<br>\
cited voce عَاذِبٌ.] ―<br>\

تَفَرَّدَ see the next paragraph, in two places.<br>\
7<br>\
انفرد and ↓ فَرَدَ signify the same: (S:) the<br>\
latter, aor.<br>\
فَرُدَ, [inf. n. فُرُودٌ,] is expl. by Lth as<br>\
signifying He was, or became, alone, by himself,<br>\
apart from others, or solitary: (T, L:) and thus<br>\
انفرد بِنَفْسِهِ signifies. (Msb.) And انفرد عَنْهُ He,<br>\
or it, was, or became, apart, or separate, from<br>\
him, or it, and alone. (L.) And انفرد بِفُلاَنِ and<br>\
↓ استفردهُ are syn. [as meaning He was, or became,<br>\
alone with such a one]. (M, A, K.) And انفرد<br>\
بَالأَمْرِ, (AZ, T, M, L, K,) and بِكَذَا, (S,) and<br>\

and ↓ افرد, (L, K,) and ↓ تفرّد, and ↓ استفرد; (S,<br>\
M, L, K;) signify alike; (AZ, T, S, M, L, K;)<br>\
i. e. He was, or became, alone; independent of<br>\
others; without any to share, or participate, with<br>\
him; in the affair, and in such a thing, and in<br>\
his opinion: (the lexicons passim: [see اِسْتَبَدَّ:])<br>\
and [in like manner] بِالمَالِ ↓ تفرّد [he was without<br>\
any to share, or participate, with him in the property]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  لَأُقَاتِلَنَّهُمْ حتَّى تَنْفَرِدُ سَالِفَتِى,<br>\
occurring in a trad., means (assumed tropical:)  I will assuredly fight<br>\
with them until I die; lit., until the side of my<br>\
neck shall become separate from my body; because<br>\
its separation can be only by death. (L.)<br>\
10<br>\
استفرد as intrans.: see 7.<br>\
-A2-  استفردهُ: see 7.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also He found him alone, having no second<br>\
person with him. (A.) [Hence, one says,] اِسْتَطْرَدَ<br>\
فَجَدَّلَهُ لَهُمْ فَلَمَّا اسْتَفْرَدَ مِنْهُمْ رَجُلاً كَرَّ عَلَيْهِ [He<br>\
fled, or wheeled about widely, from them, to turn<br>\

and threw him down upon the ground]. (A, L.)<br>\
And استفرد الدُّرَّةَ He (the diver) found the pearl<br>\
alone, having no other with it. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He<br>\
took it alone; by itself; without any other, or<br>\

فَرْدَ Single; sole; only; one, and no more; syn.<br>\
وِتْرَ; (S, A, L, Msb;) i. e. وَاحِدٌ: (Msb:) [and,<br>\
used as a subst., a single, or an individual, person<br>\
or thing:] fem. فَرْدَةٌ and ↓ فَرْدَىْ [which latter is<br>\
anomalous, as though fem. of فَرْدَانُ]: (Msb:) pl.<br>\
أَفْرَادٌ and ↓ فُرَادَى which latter is anomalous, as<br>\
though pl. of فُرْدَانُ (S, L, Msb) and of فَرْدَىْ,<br>\
like as سُكَارَى is pl. of سُكْرَانُ and of سَكْرَى. (Msb.<br>\
See also فُرَادٌ, below.) You say, عَدَدْتُ الدَّرَاهِمَ<br>\
أَفْرَاداً I counted the dirhems one by one. (T, A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And Such as has no equal, or like: (Lth, M,<br>\
L, K:) pl. أَفْرَادٌ (M, K) and فُرَادَى [respecting<br>\
which latter see above]. (K.) الفَرْدُ as an epithet<br>\
applied to God means The Single; the Sole; the<br>\
One; (T;) He who has no equal, or like; the<br>\
Unequalled: (Lth, T, L:) but Az says, I have<br>\
not found it so applied in the Sunneh; and no<br>\
epithet should be applied to God except such as<br>\
He has applied to Himself, or such as the Prophet has applied to Him. (L.) And one says<br>\
سَيْفٌ فَرْدٌ, (K,) and ↓ فَرَدٌ, (T, L, K,) and ↓ فُرُدٌ,<br>\
(L, K,) and ↓ فَرِدٌ, (K,) and ↓ فَرُدٌ, (T, K,) and<br>\
↓ فَرِيدٌ and ↓ فَرْدَدٌ, (K, but the third and fifth not<br>\
in the text of the K as given in the TA,) A sword<br>\
having diversified wavy marks, streaks, or grain;<br>\
(ذُو فِرِنْدٍ, K, [in the TA وَفِرِنْدٌ, as though one said<br>\
also سَيْفٌ فِرِنْدٌ, which is evidently a mistake,])<br>\
unequalled (T, L, K) in excellence. (T, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And The half [meaning one] of a pair or couple.<br>\
(M, L, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And Such as is alone, by himself<br>\
or by itself, or apart from others; unconnected<br>\
with, or unattended by, others; solitary, or separate; syn. مُتَّحِدٌ, (M, L, K,) or مَا كَانَ وَحْدَهُ;<br>\
(Lth, L;) unmixed with others; [in which sense<br>\
it is] a word of more common application than<br>\
وِتْرٌ, and more special than وَاحِدٌ: (Kull p. 278:)<br>\
pl. فِرَادٌ (M, L, K) [and أَفْرَادٌ and فُرُودٌ also, as<br>\
will be shown below]: an ex. of the first of these<br>\
pls. occurs in the saying, (cited by IAar, L,)<br>\
تَخَلُّفَ السَّقْرِ فِرَادَ السِّرْبِ<br>\
[As the hawk&#39;s seizing, or carrying off by force,<br>\
those that are apart from the others of the flock<br>\
of birds]. (M, L. See, again, فُرَادٌ.) [Hence,]<br>\
one says ثَوْرٌ فَرْدٌ, (S,) and شَىْءٌ فَرْدٌ, (M, K,) and<br>\
↓ فَرِدٌ, (S, M, K,) and ↓ فَرَدٌ, and ↓ فَرُدٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
and ↓ فُرُدٌ, (K,) and ↓ فَارِدٌ, (S, M, K,) and ↓ فَرِيدٌ,<br>\

bull, (S,) and a thing, (M, K,) that is alone, by<br>\

K.) And ↓ نَاقَةٌ فَارِدٌ, and ↓ مِفْرَادٌ, and ↓ فَرُودٌ, A<br>\
she-camel that goes away alone, apart from others,<br>\
in the pasture, (M, L, K, *) and at the water;<br>\

applied to the male being ↓ فَارِدٌ, only. (M, L.)<br>\
And بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ ↓ هُوَ فَارِدٌ He is alone in this affair.<br>\
(A.) And it is said in a trad., ↓ لاَ تُعَدُّ فَارِدَتُكُمْ,<br>\
meaning Your ewe, or she-goat, that ye have set<br>\
apart from the flock, or herd, that ye may milk<br>\
her in the tent, or house, shall not be reckoned<br>\
[among those for which ye are to pay the poorrate]: (A:) or the meaning is, what is over and<br>\
above the فَرِيضَة [or fixed number of camels, &amp;c.,<br>\
to be given in payment of the poor-rate] shall not<br>\
be added to the latter and reckoned therewith.<br>\
(L.) And in another it is said, ↓ لاَ يَغُلُّ فَارِدَتُكُمْ,<br>\
expl. by Th as meaning Such of you as shall<br>\
segregate himself, as, for instance, one or two,<br>\
and gain spoil, shall resign it to the collective<br>\
body, and not act unfaithfully by taking it for<br>\
himself. (M, L.) And in another, فَمِنْكُمُ المُزْدَلِفُ<br>\
صَاحِبُ العِمَامَةِ الفَرْدَةِ And of you is El-Muzdelif,<br>\
he of the solitary turban: this was said of him<br>\
because, when he rode, no one with him wore a<br>\
turban, to show honour to him. (L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  لَقِيْتُهُ<br>\
فَرْدَيْنِ means I met him, we two being alone. (S,<br>\

(الدَّرَارِىْءُ) in the horizon [when other stars, there,<br>\
are invisible]: so called because they are apart<br>\
from the other [visible] stars. (M, L.) And<br>\
الفُرُودُ, (T, M, L, and so in some copies of the<br>\
K,) in some copies of the K ↓ الفُرْدُودُ, [and thus<br>\
in the CK,] but the former is the right, (TA,)<br>\
Certain stars, disposed in a row, behind the<br>\
Pleiades; (K;) in some copies of the K, around<br>\
the Pleiades: (TA:) certain bright stars around<br>\
the Pleiades. (T, L.) And (L) Certain stars<br>\

stars with حَضَارِ; so called because situate apart<br>\

in the hinder part of the neck of الشُّجَاع [the constellation Hydra; which star is also called عُنُقُ<br>\
الشُّجَاعِ]. (Kzw in his description of الشجاع.) ―<br>\

termed سِمْطٌ, not patched, nor having a second<br>\
sole added to it; (K;) a sandal having a single<br>\
sole; not having a sole composed of two pieces of<br>\
leather sewed together, one beneath the other; thus<br>\
in the saying,<br>\
يَا خَيْرَ مَنْ يَمْشِى بِنَعلٍ فَرْدِ<br>\
[O best of such as walk with a single-soled sandal],<br>\
meaning O best of the great men of the Arabs;<br>\
for sandals were worn by the Arabs, exclusively<br>\
of the foreigners; and thin sandals, only by the<br>\
kings and chief persons of the former. (L.) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
Also, and ↓ فَارِدٌ, A bull [app. a wild bull]. (Lth,<br>\

-b10-  [The pl.] الأَفْرَادُ as a<br>\
conventional term in lexicology signifies What<br>\
have been transmitted by only one of the lexicologists; what is thus transmitted, if the transmitter<br>\
is a person of exactness (as Aboo-Zeyd and ElKhaleel and others), is admitted. (Mz, 5th نوع.<br>\

فُرَادٌ [is most properly regarded as a quasi-pl. n.,<br>\
rather than as a pl., of فَرْدٌ; and فُرَادُ is similar to<br>\
it in meaning]. One says, جَاؤُوا فُرَاداً, and ↓ فُرَادَى,<br>\
(S, M, K,) with tenween and without it, (S,) and<br>\
فُرَادَ, (K,) like ثُلَاثَ and رُبَاعَ, (TA,) and ↓ فَرَادَ,<br>\

K:) AZ relates that the Kilábees said, جِئْتُمُونَا<br>\
فُرَاداً [Ye came to us one by one; or one after<br>\
another]: and هُمْ فُرَادٌ وَأَزْوَاجٌ [They are separate<br>\
persons and pairs], with tenween: and the Arabs<br>\
said قَوْمٌ فُرَادُ, imperfectly decl., likened to ثُلاَثُ<br>\
and رُبَاعُ, [A party composed of separate persons,<br>\
disposed by ones, or one after another,] and ↓ فُرَادَى,<br>\
which latter is said by Fr to be a pl.: (T, L:) and<br>\
the sing. [he adds] is ↓ فَرَدٌ and ↓ فَرِدٌ and ↓ فَرِيدٌ<br>\
and ↓ فَرْدَانُ: (T, K:) but ↓ فَرُدٌ, (so accord. to a<br>\
copy of the T,) or ↓ فَرْدٌ, (so in the K accord. to<br>\
the TA, [in the CK فُرْدٌ,]) in this sense, [i. e. in<br>\
the pl. sense] is not allowable. (T, K.)<br>\

A;) in the language of the &#39;Ajam [app. meaning<br>\

any dictionary]: accord. to Ibráheem El-Harbee,<br>\
شَذْر of silver, like pearls: (T:) or شَذْر that divide<br>\
the pearls and gold: (M, L, K:) and pearls that<br>\
are strung, and divided by other things interposed:<br>\
(S, L, K:) or pearls that divide the pieces of gold<br>\
in a necklace: (A:) one thereof is termed ↓ فَرِيدَةٌ:<br>\
(T, M, A, L:) pl. فَرَائِدُ. (T, M, K.) And A<br>\
precious, or highly-esteemed, gem; (M, L, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ فَرِيدَةٌ; (K;) as though it were the only<br>\
one of its kind; (M, L;) or so called because<br>\
unequalled; or because [it is a pearl] found alone<br>\
in its shell: (MF:) and as some say, (S,) ↓ فَرَائِدُ<br>\
الدُّرِّ signifies the large pearls. (S, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
The intermediate vertebræ between the last of the<br>\
six vertebræ that are next to the دَأْى [q. v.] of<br>\
the neck and the six that are between these فَرِيد<br>\

↓ فَرَائِدُ: (M, L, K:) or ↓ فَرِيدَةٌ [the sing.] signifies the vertebra that projects from the part, of<br>\

-b3-  سُكَّرٌ فَارِدٌ Sugar of the best kind, and<br>\
white. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And إِبِلٌ فَوَارِدُ [She-camels]<br>\
which stallions do not resemble (لاَ تُشْبِهُهَا). (So in<br>\
the O and K. [But the right reading is evidently<br>\
I think, لا تَشْتَهِيهَا, which the Turkish translator<br>\
of the K appears to have found in a copy of that<br>\
work; and the meaning, therefore, which stallions<br>\
do not desire. فَوَارِدُ is pl. of فَارِدَةٌ.])<br>\
مُفْرَدٌ: see فَرْدٌ, second quarter. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, as a<br>\

[See its verb, 4.]<br>\
ذَهَبَ مُفَرَّدٌ Pieces of gold (in a necklace, A)<br>\

means Good betide those who apply themselves to<br>\
the study of practical religion, or the law, and<br>\
withdraw from [the rest of] mankind, and attend<br>\
only to the observance of the commands and prohibitions [of religion]: (IAar, T, * L, K, TA:)<br>\
and (K, TA) it is also said to mean (TA) those<br>\
who are devoted to the commemoration of the<br>\
praises of God: (K, TA:) or, as expl. by the<br>\
Prophet himself, those men and women who commemorate the praises of God much, or frequently:<br>\
(TA:) also, (K,) or, as Kt says in explaining the<br>\
trad., (TA,) [and as his words are cited in the<br>\
T,] those whose contemporaries in birth, (K, TA,)<br>\
and the generation among which they were, (TA,)<br>\
have perished, or died, while they themselves have<br>\
remained, (K, TA,) commemorating the praises<br>\
of God: but Az holds the explanation of IAar<br>\
to be more correct than this of Kt. (TA.)<br>\
مِفْرَادٌ: see فَرْدٌ, near the middle of the paragraph.<br>\
المَفَارِيدٌ as a conventional term in lexicology<br>\
