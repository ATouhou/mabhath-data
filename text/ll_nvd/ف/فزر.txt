A&#39;Obeyd, S, O, K:) or from three to ten; thus<br>\
in the copies of the K; but in the L, to twenty:<br>\
(TA:) and two, and more: (S, O, K:) and hence,<br>\
(S, O,) الفِزْرُ was a surname of Saad Ibn-ZeydMenáh: he came to the مَوْسِم [or fair, and place<br>\
of meeting, app. of the pilgrims,] with some goats,<br>\
and allowed them to be taken as spoil, saying,<br>\
“ Whoso takes of them one, it shall be his, but a<br>\
فِزْر [i. e. a pair or more] of them shall not be<br>\
taken; ” فِزْرٌ here meaning two and more: whence<br>\
the prov., لَا آتِيكَ مِعْزَى الفِزْرِ, meaning [I will<br>\
not come to thee] until the goats of El-Fizr shall<br>\
become gathered together; and [that means never,<br>\
for] those goats will never become gathered together: (S, O, K:) or, accord. to ISd, this surname was given to him because he said to his<br>\
sons, one after another, “Pasture ye these goats,”<br>\
and they were incompliant to him; so he called<br>\
to the people, “Collect yourselves together; ” and<br>\
they did so; and he said, “Take ye them as spoil;<br>\
but I do not allow to any one more than one; ”<br>\
therefore they separated them at once, and they<br>\
became scattered in the country: this was the<br>\
origin of the prov.: and one of their provs. relating to leaving a thing undone is the saying, لَا<br>\
أَفْعَلُ ذَلِكَ مِعْزَىالفِزْرِ [I will not do that until<br>\
the goats of El-Fizr shall become gathered together. (TA.) Accord. to AO, (S, O, TA,) فِزْرٌ<br>\
means The kid (S, O, K, TA) itself: (S, O, TA:)<br>\
and one says, لَاأَفْعَلُهُ مَا نَزَا فِزْرٌ [I will not do it<br>\
as long as a kid leaps]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The male<br>\
young one of the نَمِر [or leopard]: (TA:) or the<br>\
male young one of the [beast of prey called] بَبْر<br>\
[q. v.], (O, K, TA, [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
بَيْر,]) as is said in the T, and likewise in the<br>\
Tekmileh: (TA:) and فِزْرَةٌ signifies the female<br>\
young one thereof; (O, K, TA;) or, as some say,<br>\
the sister thereof: (TA:) and ↓ فَزَارَةٌ signifies the<br>\
female of the بَبْر; (O, Msb, TA;) thus says<br>\

the female of the نَمِر; (K, TA;) thus says IAar.<br>\

signifies slits, rents, or fissures, and clefts, or<br>\

cleaves them as though it made furrows upon their<br>\
heads: you say, أَخَذْنَاالفَازِرَ and أَخَذْنَاطَرِيقَ الفَازِرِ,<br>\

upon the heads and the base of the mountains.<br>\

road taking its course in a tract of sand amid<br>\
