فَاضَ, (S, M, Mgh, &amp;c.,) aor. يَفِيضُ, inf. n.<br>\
فَيْضٌ (S, M, O, Msb, K) and فَيْضُوضَةٌ (S, O, K)<br>\
andفُيُوضٌ (M, O, K) and فِيُوضٌ and فُيُوضَةٌ (M,<br>\
K) and فَيَضَانٌ, (M, O, K,) It (water) overflowed:<br>\
poured out, or forth, from fulness: (Mgh:) it<br>\
(water, S, O, K, or a torrent, Msb) became abundant, (S, O, Msb, K and flowed from [over] the<br>\
brink of the valley, (Msb,) or so as to flow over<br>\
the side of the valley, (S, O,) or so as to flow like<br>\
a valley; (K;) and ↓ افاض signifies the same:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) it (water) became abundant: (TA:)<br>\
[contr. of غَاضَ, aor. يَغِيضُ:] it (water, and that<br>\
of the eyes, and the like, M, or anything fluid,<br>\
Msb) ran, or flowed: (M, Msb:) or it poured<br>\
out, or forth; or poured out, or forth, vehemently;<br>\
gushed out, or forth: (M:) and it (water, and<br>\
blood,) fell in drops. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It (a vessel)<br>\
became full: (Msb:) [or it overflowed: for you<br>\
say,] فَاضَ النَّهْرُ بِمَائِهِ The river overflowed with<br>\
its water: and فَاضَ الإِنَآءُ بِمَا فِيهِ The vessel overflowed with what was in it: (Msb:) and a poet<br>\
says,<br>\
شَكَوْتُ وَمَا الشَّكْوَى لِمِثْلِىَ عَادَةً<br>\
وَلٰكِنْ تَفِيضُ الكَأْسُ عِنْدَ امْتِلَائِهَا<br>\
[I complained; and complaint is not a custom of<br>\
the like of me; but the cup overflows on the occasion of its being full]. (A) You say also فَاضَتْ<br>\
عَيْنُهُ, aor. as above, inf. n. فَيْضٌ, The eye flowed<br>\
[with tears]. (TA.) And فَاصَ عَرَقًا, said of a man,<br>\
[He sweated;] sweat appeared upon his body, on<br>\
an occasion of grief. (IKtt) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  It (a thing)<br>\
was, or became, much, abundant, many, or unmerous. (O, K.) You say, فَاضَ اللِّئَامُ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
mean became many: (S, O:) opposed to غَاضَ,<br>\
q. v. (S and A in art. غيض.) And فَاضَ الخَيْرُ<br>\
(tropical:)  Good, or wealth, &amp;c., became abundant, (A,<br>\
Msb,) فِيهِمْ among them. (A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Aor. as above,<br>\
(S,) inf. n. فَيْضٌ, (TA,) (tropical:)  It (a piece of news, or<br>\
a story,) spread abroad; (S, M, K;) as also<br>\
↓ استفاض; (S, M, A, Msb, K, TA;) it spread<br>\
abroad among the people. (Msb and TA in explanation of the latter verb,) like water. (TA.)<br>\
↓ The latter is also said of a place, meaning (tropical:)  It<br>\
became wide, or ample. (A.) And you say, فَاضَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ الدِّرْعُ (tropical:)  [The coat of mail spread over him;<br>\
or covered him]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Aor. as above, inf. n.<br>\
فَيْضٌ and فُيُوضٌ, (tropical:)  He (a man, S, O, K) died: (S,<br>\
M, O, K:) and, (S, M, O, K,) in like manner,<br>\
(S, O,) فَاضَتٌ نَفْسُهُ, (S, M, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
aor. as above, (M,) inf. n. فَيْضٌ, (M, Msb,) (tropical:)  his<br>\
soul departed, or went forth; (S, M, A, * Mgh, *<br>\
O, Msb, K;) of the dial. of Temeem; (S, M, O;)<br>\
on the authority of AO and Fr; and AZ says the<br>\
like; but As says that one should not say, فاض<br>\
الرَّجُلُ, nor فاضت نفسه, for فاض is only said of<br>\
tears and of water: (S, O:) to which is added<br>\
in the O, but one says, فَاظَ, with ظ, [as is also<br>\
said in the Mgh,] as meaning “ he died,” and<br>\
not فاض, with ض, decidedly: (TA:) [see, however, the remarks of IB below:] or the more<br>\
chaste expression is فاظ, with ظ, without the<br>\
mention of the نفس; and some do not allow any<br>\
other: (Msb:) but in the L we find as follows:<br>\
IAar says. فاض الرجل and فاظ, meaning “ the<br>\
man died: ” and Abu-l-Hasan says, فاظت نفسه,<br>\
the verb relating to the نفس; and فاض الرجل<br>\
and فاظ: but As says, I heard AA say that one<br>\
should not say, فاظت نفسه, but فاظ, meaning<br>\
“ he died; ” and not فاض, with ض, decidedly:<br>\
IB, however, says that what IDrd has cited<br>\
from As is different from that which J has<br>\
ascribed to him; for IDrd cites the words of As<br>\
thus: the Arabs says, فاظ الرجل, meaning “ the<br>\
man died; ” but when they speak of the نفس,<br>\
they say فاضت نفسه, with ض; and he quotes<br>\
the ex.<br>\
فَفُقِئَتْ عَيْنٌ وَفَاضَتْ نَفْسُ<br>\
[And an eye was put out, and a soul departed]:<br>\
and he [IB] adds that this is what is commonly<br>\
known to be the opinion of As: but J has committed and error; for As quotes from AA that one<br>\
should not say, فاظت نفسه, but فاظ, meaning “ he<br>\
died; ” not فاض, decidedly and he also says,<br>\
nor does it necessarily follow from what he relates that he firmly believed it: AO says that<br>\
فاظت نفسه is of the dial. of Keys; and فاضت,<br>\
of the dial of Temeem and AHát says, I heard<br>\
AZ say that Benoo-Dabbeh alone say, فاضت نفسه:<br>\
in like manner also El-Mázinee says. on the<br>\
authority of AZ. that all the Arabs say, فاظت<br>\
نفسه. except Benoo-Dabbeh, who say, فاضت نفسه<br>\
with ض. (TA.) [See also art. فيظ. It is further said, that] الفَيْضُ signifies Death: (A, K;)<br>\
as occurring in a trad respecting Ed-Dejjál,<br>\
where it is said, ثُمَّ يَكُونُ عَلَى أَثَرِ ذٰلِكَ الفَيْضُ<br>\
[Then shall be, after that, death] (A, TA:) Sh<br>\
says, I asked El-Bekráwee respecting this, and<br>\
he asserted الفيض, in this case, to signify<br>\
“ death; ” but I have not heard it from any<br>\
other; unless it be from فَاضَتْ نَفْسَهُ signifying<br>\
His slaver collecting upon his lips at the departure<br>\
of his soul [flowed]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  You say also فَاضَ<br>\
صدْرُهُ مِنَ الغَيْظِ (tropical:)  [His bosom overflowed with<br>\
wrath, or rage], (A, TA.) And فَاضَ صَدْرُهُ<br>\
بِالسِّرِّ His bosom disclosed, or concealed, the secret;<br>\
(S, O, K;) his bosom could not conceal the secret;<br>\
(M;) his bosom was full with the secret, and disclosed it, not being able to conceal it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
And فَيْضٌ is used as meaning (assumed tropical:)  God&#39;s suggesting<br>\
(إِلْقَآء) [of a thing]: what the Devil suggests<br>\
(يُلْقِيهِ) is termed الوَسْوَسَةُ. (Kull p. 277.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
فَاضَ البَعِيرُ بِجِرَّتِهِ: see 4, latter half.<br>\
4<br>\
افاض: see 1, first sentence.<br>\
-A2-  He filled a<br>\
vessel so that it overflowed: (S, M, O, K:) or<br>\
[simply] he filled a vessel, (M, Msb,) accord. to<br>\
Lh; but the former. [says ISd,] in my opinion,<br>\
is the correct signification. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He made<br>\
water, and tears, and the like, to run, or flow;<br>\
or to pour out, or forth; or to pour out, or forth,<br>\
vehemently; to gush out, or forth: (M:) he poured<br>\
[water &amp;c.] out, or forth: (A, TA:) or he poured<br>\
water out, or forth, copiously. (Mgh.) You say,<br>\
افاض المَآءَ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ, (S, O, K,) or على جَسَدِهِ,<br>\
(Msb,) He poured the water (S, O, Msb, K) upon<br>\
himself, (S, O, K,) or upon his body. (Msb.)<br>\
And افاض دُمُوعَهُ, (S,) or دَمْعَهُ, (Msb,) He poured<br>\
forth his tears. (Msb.) And افاضت العَيْنُ الدَّمْعَ<br>\
[The eye poured forth tears]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  افاض اللّٰهُ<br>\
الخَيْرَ (tropical:)  God made good, or wealth, &amp;c., to abound.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  افاض عَلَيْهِ الدِّرْعَ (tropical:)  He put on him the<br>\
coat of mail: like as you say صَبَّهَا [lit he poured<br>\
it]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  أَفَاضُوا مِنْ عَرَفَاتٍ (tropical:)  They pushed<br>\
on, pressed on, or went quickly, syn. دَفَعُوا, (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, K,) or اِنْدَفَعُوا, (M, A,) with multitude, (M, Mgh, O,) from &#39;Arafát, (S, M, A, Mgh,<br>\
O, Msb, K,) to Minè, (S, M, O,) exclaiming لَبَّيْكَ:<br>\
(M:) or they returned, and dispersed themselves<br>\
from &#39;Arafát: (O, K:) or they hastened from<br>\
&#39;Arafát to another place: (K:) the last rendering<br>\
is taken from Ibn-&#39;Arafeh; and agreeably with all<br>\
of these renderings, the phrase in the Kur [ii. 194],<br>\
فَإِذَا أَفَضْتُمْ مِنْ عَرَفَاتٍ, has been explained: (TA:)<br>\
and [in like manner,] you say افاضوا مِنَ مِنَى إِلَى<br>\
مَكِّةَ (tropical:)  They returned from Mine to Mekkeh; on<br>\
the day of the sacrifice: (Msb:) إِفَاضَةٌ signifies<br>\
(tropical:)  the advancing, and pushing on, or pressing on,<br>\
in journeying, or pace, (A, * TA,) and the like,<br>\
(A,) with multitude, and is only after a state of<br>\
separation and congregation: (TA:) it is from<br>\
the same word as signifying the “ pouring out, or<br>\
forth; ” (A, O, TA,) or from افاض المَآءَ signifying<br>\
“ he poured the water out, or forth, copiously ”<br>\
(Mgh:) and the original expression is افاض نَفْسَهُ.<br>\
or رَاحِلَتَهُ; but they omit the objective complement, and hence the verb resembles one that is<br>\
intrans.: (O, TA:) or افاضة signifies the quickly<br>\
impelling or urging [a beast] to run, with one&#39;s foot<br>\
or leg, or feet or legs: and افاض, he (a (??)) made<br>\
his camel to exert himself beyond measure, (??)<br>\
quick run, between the utmost (??) and what is (??)<br>\
than that; افاضة denoting the half [of the fall (??)<br>\
of the run of camels having riders upon these;<br>\
and being only applied when they have riders<br>\
upon them: (Khálid Ibn-Jembeh:) and every<br>\
دَفْعَة [or act of pushing on, or pressing (??),] is<br>\
termed إِفَاضَةٌ. (S, Msb, K.) Hence, طَوَافُ الإِفَاضَةِ,<br>\
signifying The (??) [around the K(??)<br>\
the return from Mine to Mekkeh; (Msb, TA)<br>\
on the day of the sacrifice: (TA:) or the circuiting of visitation. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b6-  افاضوا فِى الحَدِيثِ<br>\
(tropical:)  They pushed on, or pressed on, in discourse; syn.<br>\
اِنْدَفَعُوا: (Lh, S, M, A, O,) they entered thereinto; launched forth, or cut, thereinto: (Lh, M,<br>\
O;) they were large, or copious, or profuse, therein;<br>\
(O, TA:) or they dilated therein (M:) or they<br>\
began, commenced, or entered upon, discourse:<br>\
(Msb;) as also ↓ استفاضوهُ, (M, Msb,) accord. to<br>\
some; (Msb;) but this latter is disallowed by<br>\
most; (M;) or by the skilful, (Msb.) You say<br>\
also, افاض فِى عَمَلٍ (assumed tropical:)  He entered into an action,<br>\
or employment; and pushed on, or pressed on,<br>\
therein: (Bd in x. 62:) or he began it, commenced<br>\
it, or entered upon it. (Jel, ibid.) ―<br>\
-b7-  افاض بَالشَّيْءِ<br>\
He impelled, or thrust, with the thing: (M:) he<br>\
cast, or threw, the thing. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  افاض البَعِيرُ<br>\
بِجِرَّتِهِ, (Lh, S, M, A, O,) and (S, O) افاض alone,<br>\
(S, O, K,) and بِجِرَّتِهِ ↓ فَاضَ, (TA,) (tropical:)  The camel<br>\
propelled his cud (Lh, S, M, A, K) from his inside,<br>\
(Lh, M, A,) or from his stomach, (S, K,) and<br>\
expelled it, or ejected it: (S:) or cast it forth in<br>\
a scattered and copious state: or it means [he<br>\
made to be heard] the sound of his cud, and of<br>\
his chewing. (M.) ―<br>\
-b9-  مَا افاض بِكَلِمَةٍ (assumed tropical:)  He did not<br>\
make clear, or distinct, or perspicuous, a word, or<br>\
sentence. (Msb, TA.) [And ما افاض بكلمة signifies the same.] ―<br>\
-b10-  افاض بِالقِدَاحِ, (S, M, A, O,<br>\
K,) and عَلَى القِدَاحِ, meaning بِالقِدَاحِ, for prepositions stand in the places of other prepositions,<br>\
(S, O,) and افاض القِدَاحَ, (O, K,) (tropical:)  i. q. ضَرَبَ<br>\
بِالقِدَاحِ [which has two significations: He turned<br>\
about, or shuffled, the gaming-arrows: and he<br>\
played with the gaming-arrows]: (S, M, A, O,<br>\
K:) and أَجَالَهَا [which has the former of the above<br>\
significations]: or he dealt them forth. (TA.)<br>\
Aboo-Dhu-eyb says, describing a [wild] he-ass<br>\
and his she-asses,<br>\
فَكَأَنَّهُنَّ رِبَابَةٌ وَكَأَنَّهُ<br>\
يَسَرٌ يُفِيضُ عَلَى القِدَاحِ وَيَصْدَعُ<br>\
(S, TA) (tropical:)  [And it was as though they were a<br>\
bundle of gaming-arrows, and as though he were<br>\
a shuffler thereof, shuffling or] dealing out the arrows, and deciding, and making known what he<br>\
produced: (TA:) or, accord. to Kh, and speaking with his loudest voice, saying “ The arrow of<br>\
such a one has won,” or “ This is the arrow of<br>\
such a one: ” or, accord. to some, distributing, or<br>\
dispensing, by means of the arrows: (TA in art.<br>\
صدع:) by عَلَى القِدَاحِ is meant بِالقِدَاحِ. (S voce<br>\
عَلَى.) One relation of this verse substitutes<br>\
يَخُوضُ for يُفِيضُ. (TA.) Az says that إِفَاض [a<br>\
mistranscription for إِفَاضَةٌ] is always a consequence<br>\
of a state of separation, or dispersion, and abundance, or copiousness. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  Hence the saying<br>\
in a trad. respecting a thing picked up from the<br>\
ground, ثُمَّ أَفِضْهَا مِنْ مَالِكَ, [app. a mistake for<br>\
فِى مَالِكَ,] i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Then put thou, or throw thou, it,<br>\
and mix it, among thy property. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b12-  أُفِيضَتْ<br>\

indicated in the M.]. (O, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تفيّض It flowed. (Har p. 610. [But this<br>\
I do not find elsewhere.])<br>\

of water, (K, TA,) &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\

half of the paragraph. You say also, استفاض<br>\
الوَادِى شَجَرًا (tropical:)  The valley became wide, and abundant in trees. (S, O, K, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  استفاضوا<br>\
الحَدِيثَ: see افاضوا فِى الحَدِيثِ. [It seems to be<br>\
indicated in the S and O that it signifies They<br>\
spread abroad the story among the people; as<br>\
used by some: see مُسْتَفِيضٌ.]<br>\
فَيْضٌ A river, (M, TA,) in general: (TA:) pl.<br>\
[of pauc.] أَفْيَاضٌ and [of mult.] فُيُوضٌ: the<br>\
pluralization thereof shows that it is not an inf. n.<br>\
used as a subst.: (M, TA:) [and a river, or<br>\
water, that overflows.] الفَيْضُ is [hence] applied<br>\
to The Nile of Egypt: (S, O, K:) or, accord. to<br>\
the Tekmileh, to a place in the Nile of Egypt:<br>\
(TA:) and to the river of El-Basrah: (As, S,<br>\

its greatness. (M.) You say also أَرْضٌ ذَاتُ فُيُوضٍ<br>\

simply a gift, favour, or grace:] pl. فُيُوضٌ. (KL.)<br>\

-b3-  دِرْعٌ مُفَاضَةٌ (tropical:)  A<br>\
wide, or an ample, coat of mail; (S, M, A, O,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ فَاضَةٌ (IJ, M) and فَيُوضٌ. (M.)<br>\

not say مُسْتَفَاضٌ [alone], (As, Fr, ISk, and the<br>\

or this last is a word of weak authority: (K:)<br>\
it is, however, used by some; (S, O;) for instance,<br>\
by Aboo-Temmám; (TA;) as meaning begun, commenced, or entered upon; but most disallow it<br>\
unless followed by فِيهِ. (M.)<br>\
