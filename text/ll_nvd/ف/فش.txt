(assumed tropical:)  I will assuredly make thine anger to come forth<br>\
from thy head, as one makes the wind to come<br>\
forth from the milk-skin, or butter-skin: said to<br>\

remove thy boastfulness, &amp;c.: (TA:) or I will assuredly take away thy pride, and thy vanity, or<br>\
vain glory, or conceit, &amp;c.: (Th:) or the meaning<br>\

accord to Lth, (O,) الفَشُّ signifies تَتَبُّعُ السَّرِقَةِ<br>\

name is now commonly applied to the carob, or<br>\
locust-tree; ceratonia siliqua]; as also ↓ فَشُوشٌ,<br>\

to AA. (O.)<br>\

means [a wide, depressed, piece of ground,] such<br>\

-A4-  Also, and ↓ فَشُوشٌ,<br>\
and ↓ فَشْفَاشٌ, [this last said in the TA to be<br>\
written by Sgh with kesr, but it is not so in the<br>\
O,] A [garment of the kind called] كِسَآء such as<br>\
is thick (IAar, O, K, TA) in texture, (TA,) fine<br>\
in the yarn; (IAar, O, K, TA;) called by the<br>\
vulgar ↓ فَشَّاشٌ; (O; in the TA فِشّاش;) or, as<br>\
some say, ↓ فَشَّاشٌ signifies a thick كسآء; and<br>\
↓ فَشُوشٌ, a thin, or flimsy, كسآء, such as is scanty<br>\
in the yarn. (TA.)<br>\
فَشَاشِ, like قَطَامِ, [indecl.,] means ↓ الفَاشَّةُ [i. e.<br>\
She who makes the wind to come forth from a<br>\
skin, by loosing the tie round its mouth: in the<br>\
TA expl. only as signifying الضَّرُوطُ عِنْدَالجِمَاعِ,<br>\
which may be a secondary meaning, but is not<br>\
the meaning in what here follows]. (O, K.) فَشَاشِ<br>\
مِنِ اسْتِهِ إِلَى فِيهِ ↓ فُشِّيهِ [lit. O woman discharging<br>\
the confined wind of the skin, discharge thou its<br>\
confined wind, from its anus to its mouth, i. e.,<br>\
from end to end], (Meyd, O, K,) which is a prov.,<br>\
(Meyd, O,) means (assumed tropical:)  [O woman] do thou with it,<br>\
or him, what thou wilt, for it, or he, has no means<br>\
of self-defence (Meyd, O, L, K) nor of becoming<br>\
altered; and it is said in relation to an angry<br>\
man who is not able to become altered: (L:)<br>\
الفَشُّ is the making the wind to come forth from<br>\
a وَطْب. (Meyd.)<br>\
فِشَاشٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
فَشُوشٌ A female slave who emits noiseless wind<br>\
from the anus; as also فَاشّاء [an evident mistranscription for ↓ فَاشَّةٌ]: (IAar, in TA:) [or] a<br>\
woman from whom wind issues on the occasion of<br>\
الجِمَاع: (IDrd, O, K, TA:) or, accord. to the<br>\
K, applied to a woman, sonum submissum genitalibus edens in congressu: and also, applied to a<br>\
man, who glories, or boasts, vainly: but these two<br>\
explanations are there wrongly assigned: (TA:)<br>\
the former of them applies to نَجَّاخَة; and the<br>\
latter, to فَيُوش; two epithets occurring, with<br>\
فَشُوش, in a verse of Ru-beh. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And,<br>\
applied to a woman, i. q. خَلَّابَةٌ [i. e. Very deceitful]: (O, CK, TA:) thus correctly, with خ: in<br>\
some copies of the K with ح; and in others, with<br>\
ج. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A woman who sits upon the<br>\
جُرْدَان. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (O, K,) applied to a<br>\

TA,) meaning Whose milk flows forth without its<br>\
being drawn, by reason of the wideness of the orifice of the teat: or whose milk flows forth in<br>\
separate jets, like the rays of the rising sun, into<br>\
the vessel, so as not to make froth: and ↓ فِشَاشٌ<br>\
signifies the quality, or state, that is denoted by<br>\
this epithet thus applied. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A skin,<br>\
such as is used for water or milk, that sweats, or<br>\
exudes moisture. (O, K.)<br>\
-A3-  See also فَشٌّ, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
فَشِيشٌ The sound of a gentle emission of wind<br>\
from the anus. (TA.) ―<br>\

skin of a viper when it moves along upon a dry,<br>\
or rigid, substance. (TA.)<br>\
فَشَّاشٌ One who opens locks by artifice, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) without their keys. (Msb.)<br>\

فَشْفَاشٌ A man who inflates himself with lying,<br>\
and arrogates to himself that which belongs to<br>\
another. (TA.)<br>\
