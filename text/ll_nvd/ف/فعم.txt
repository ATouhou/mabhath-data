فَعُمَ, aor.<br>\
فَعُمَ, inf. n. فَعَامَةٌ and فُعُومَةٌ, It was,<br>\
or became, full; said of the سَاعِد [or fore arm];<br>\
(S, K;) and of a vessel. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فَعُمَتْ,<br>\
said of a woman, She was, or became, full-formed,<br>\
and thick in her shank. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 4, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
2<br>\
فَعَّمَ see what next follows.<br>\
4<br>\
افعم; [like أَفْأَمَ;] (S, K;) and so افغم;<br>\
(K in art. فغم;) as also ↓ فعّم; (thus in some of<br>\
the copies of the K;) or ↓ فَعَمَ, (thus accord. to<br>\
other copies of the K and accord. to the TA,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
فَعَمَ, inf. n. فَعْمٌ; (TA;) He filled a vessel;<br>\
(S, K, TA;) and exceeded the usual degree, or<br>\
strove, or laboured, or did not fall short of what<br>\
was requisite, in filling it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And أَفْعَمْتُ<br>\
البَيْتَ بِرِيحِ العُودِ [I filled the house, or chamber,<br>\
or tent, with the odour of aloes-wood]. (S.) It is<br>\
said in a trad., لَوْ أَنْ امْرَأَةً مِنَ الحُورِ العِينَ أَشْرَفَتْ<br>\
لَأَفْعَمَتْ مَا َبيْنَ السَّمَآءِ وَالأَرْضِ رِيحَ المِسْكِ i. e. [If<br>\
a woman (or Paradise) of those having eyes like<br>\
the eyes of gazelles rose into view,] she would fill<br>\
[the space between the heaven and the earth with<br>\
the odour of musk]: thus related: and also<br>\
لَأَفْغَمَتْ, and لَفَغَمَتْ: but Az says that the right<br>\
relation is لافعمت, with ع. (TA in this art. and<br>\
in art. فغم.) And one says, افعم المِسْكُ البَيْتَ<br>\
The musk filled with its odour, (S,) or perfumed,<br>\
(K,) [the house, or chamber, or tent.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
افعم الرَّجُلَ He filled the man with anger; (S,<br>\
TA;) mentioned by Az on the authority of Aboo-Turáb: (TA:) or he angered him: or he filled his<br>\
nose with odour, (K, TA,) i. e. with sweet odour:<br>\
(TA:) as also ↓ فَعِمَهُ and ↓ فَعَمَهُ, aor. of both<br>\
فَعَمَ,<br>\
(K, TA,) inf. n. فَعْمٌ; but better known with the<br>\
pointed غ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And افعمهُ and افغمهُ He<br>\
filled him with joy, or happiness. (Aboo-Turáb,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
12<br>\
اِفْعَوْعَمَ It became full, and overflowed.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And افعوعم طِيبًا It (a house, or chamber,<br>\
or tent,) became filled with perfume. (TA.)<br>\
فَعْمٌ Full; applied in this sense to a سَاعِد [or<br>\
fore arm]; (S, K;) and to a vessel; as also<br>\
↓ فَعْمَلٌ, in which the ل is augmentative: (K:)<br>\
and full of flesh; applied to the place of the<br>\
anklet. (TA.) It is said of the Prophet, in a<br>\
trad., كَانَ فَعْمَ الأَوْصَال i. e. He was full in<br>\
respect of the limbs. (TA.) And one says اِمْرَأَةٌ<br>\
فَعْمَةٌ A woman full-formed, and thick in her<br>\
shank. (K.) And حَاضِرٌ فَعْمٌ A [great] tribe<br>\
filled with its people. (TA.) [See also مُفْعَمٌ:<br>\
and see أَفْعَمُ.]<br>\
-A2-  And A species of tree: or the<br>\
rose. (K.)<br>\
فَعْمَلٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
أَفْعَمُ Full [like فَعْمٌ]: or overflowing by reason<br>\
of fulness. (TA.)<br>\
مُفْعَمٌ Filled; applied in this sense to a skin<br>\
for water or milk; as also مُفْأَمٌ: but as to ↓ مَفْعُومٌ,<br>\
IAar asserts that he had not heard it except in a<br>\
verse of Kutheiyir: Az, however, mentions it as<br>\
signifying full [like فَعْمٌ], applied to a river, or<br>\
rivulet: and Aboo-Sahl cites an ex. of it from<br>\
the verses of the Fs as signifying full of flesh.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The phrase سَيْلٌ مُفْعَمٌ may be of the<br>\
same category as هَمٌّ نَاصِبٌ [for هَمٌّ ذُو نَصَبٍ], the<br>\
meaning being A torrent having the quality of<br>\
filling; though the possessive epithet in most<br>\
instances has the form of the act. part. n., such<br>\
as طَالِقٌ [for ذَاتَ طَلَاقٍ] and مُرْضِعٌ [for ذَاتُ رَضِيعٍ]:<br>\
or it may be that مَفْعَمٌ in this case is expressive<br>\
of muchness, or abundance, like the latter word<br>\
in the phrase شِعْرٌ شَاعِرٌ and in مَوْتٌ مَائِتٌ. (Ham<br>\
p. 106.)<br>\
مَفْعُومٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
فعو or فعى<br>\
1<br>\
فَعَا شَيْئًا i. q. فتته [so in my original, app., if<br>\
not a mistranscription, فَتَّتَهُ i. e. He crumbled a<br>\
thing much]; said of a man. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
فعّى, inf. n. تَفْعِيَةٌ, He branded a camel with<br>\
a mark in the form of the viper (الأَفْعَى). (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
افعى He (a man) became possessed of [or<br>\
characterized by] evil after good or goodness.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تفعّى He (a man, S) became like the viper<br>\
(الأَفْعَى, S, K) in evil: (S, TA:) or, as in the A,<br>\
he made himself to resemble the viper (تَشَّبَهَ بِالأَفْعَى)<br>\
in the evilness of his disposition. (TA.)<br>\
فَاعٍ Angry and foaming [with anger]. (IAar,<br>\
M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [the fem.] فَاعِيَةٌ A woman (TA)<br>\
wont to calumniate; syn. نَمَّامَةٌ. (K, TA: in the<br>\
CK الثُّمامَةُ is put for النَّمَّامَةُ.)<br>\
فَاعِيَةٌ [as a subst.] The flower of the حِنَّآء [i. e.<br>\
Lawsonia inermis, or Egyptian privet]: (K:)<br>\
[said to be] a dial. var. of فَاغِيَةٌ [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
أَفْعًى, (S, Msb, K) of the fem. gender, but with<br>\
tenween, (S, Msb,) because it is a subst., not an<br>\
epithet; (Msb;) [said in the S and Msb to be<br>\
like أَرْوًى; but this is a mistake, for اروى is without tenween;] or it is an epithet and a subst.;<br>\
(K, TA;) but mostly a subst.; (TA;) [if used<br>\
as an epithet, it is without tenween, written أَفْعَى,<br>\
being also of the measure of a verb;] A certain<br>\
serpent, (S, Msb, K,) of a malignant kind; [i. e.<br>\
the viper;] also called ↓ أُفْعُوٌّ, (K, TA, [in the<br>\
CK, erroneously, اُفْعُوان, which see in what<br>\
follows,]) occurring in a trad., in which it is said<br>\
that there is no harm in the killing of the أُفْعُوّ<br>\
and the حُدُوّ by the مُحْرِم, the [final] alif being<br>\
changed into و in both of these words in the dial.<br>\
of El-Hijáz: (TA:) it is spotted, black and white;<br>\
slender in the neck; broad in the head; it is said<br>\
that it will not quit its place; (TA;) always coiling itself round; and neither antidote nor charm<br>\
is of any avail against it: (Msb, TA:) sometimes it has two horns [i. e. it sometimes signifies<br>\
the cerastes, or horned viper]: (TA:) ↓ أُفْفُوَانٌ<br>\
signifies the male: (S, Msb, TA:) [see also<br>\
خِشَاشٌ:] the pl. is أَفَاعٍ. (S, Msb, K. * [In the<br>\
K, the pl. is written أَفَاعِى, which, when indeterminate, is wrong.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] by way of comparison [to vipers], (TA,) الأَفَاعِى signifies (tropical:)  Certain veins (عُرُوق) that branch off from the حَالِبَانِ<br>\
[q. v.]. (K.)<br>\
أَفْعآءٌ [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned]<br>\
Sweet, or pleasant, odours. (IAar, M, K.)<br>\
أُفْعُوٌّ, and أُفْعُوانٌ: see أَفْعًى.<br>\
أَرْضٌ مَفْعَاةٌ A land in which are vipers (أَفَاعٍ):<br>\
or, abounding therewith. (K.)<br>\
مُفَعًّى A camel branded with a mark in the<br>\
form of the viper (الأَفْعَى): (K:) and [the fem.]<br>\
مُفَعَّاةٌ camels (إِبِلٌ) branded therewith. (TA.)<br>\
مُفَعَّاةٌ [as a subst.] A brand in the form of the<br>\
viper (الأَفْعَى). (S, K.)<br>\
