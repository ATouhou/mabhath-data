فَعَلَهُ, (S, O, Msb, K, *) aor.<br>\
فَعَلَ, (S, O, K,)<br>\
inf. n. فَعْلٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and فَعَالٌ, (S, O, Msb,)<br>\
and ↓ فِعْلٌ is the subst. therefrom, (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K, *) but, accord. to Ibn-Kemál, it has become<br>\
commonly used as the inf. n.; MF, however,<br>\
says that its being thus used requires consideration; and it is said that there is no instance like<br>\
فَعَلَهُ, aor. يَفْعَلُهُ, inf. n. فِعْلٌ, except سَحَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
يَسْحَرُهُ, inf. n. سِحْرٌ; or, to these may be added<br>\
as sometimes occurring, خَدَعَ, aor. يَخْدَعُ, inf. n.<br>\
خَدْعٌ and خِدْعٌ, and صَرَعَ, aor. يَصْرَعُ, inf. n. صَرْعٌ<br>\
and صِرْعٌ; (TA;) [He did it]; namely, a thing<br>\
(S, O. [For further explanation see فِعْلٌ below.])<br>\
[In the Kur. xxi. 73,] some read وَأَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْهِمْ فَعْلَ<br>\
الْخَيْرَاتِ [And we suggested to them the doing of<br>\
good works]; (Lth, S, O;) others reading ↓ فِعْلَ<br>\
الخيرات. (Lth, O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And one says also فَعَلَ بِهِ<br>\
[He did to him something]. (TA.) [فَعَلَ اللّٰهُ بِهِ<br>\
is a form of imprecation, meaning May God do<br>\
to him what He will do; i. e. may God punish<br>\
him: see an ex. voce أَظْلَمُ. ―<br>\
-b3-  And فَعَلَ بِالمَرْأَةِ<br>\
often occurs in trads. &amp;c. as meaning He compressed the woman.]<br>\
2<br>\
تَفْعِيلٌ [inf. n. of فعّل] is used by IJ as<br>\
metonymically signifying The scanning of a verse;<br>\
because the names of the measures of its feet, all<br>\
of them, have the letters ف and ع and ل for<br>\
constituents, as when you say فَعُولُنْ and مَفَاعِيلنْ<br>\
and فَاعِلَاتُنْ and فَاعِلُنْ &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
فَاْعَلَ [فَاعَلَا, inf. n. فِعَالٌ, if used, app. signifies<br>\
They two did a thing together.] See فِعَالٌ below.<br>\
7<br>\
انفعل quasi-pass. of 1: you say, فَعَلْتُهُ<br>\
فَانْفَعَلَ [I did it, and it was done]; (S, Msb;)<br>\
like your saying كَسَرْتُهُ فَانْكَسَرَ. (S.) [الاِنْفِعَالُ<br>\
signifies The suffering, or receiving, the effect of<br>\
an act, whether the effect is intended by the agent<br>\
or not: or, accord. to some, particularly when<br>\
the effect is not intended: for it is implied in a<br>\
passage in the TA, that it is held by some to be<br>\
used particularly in cases in which the effects are<br>\
such as the blushing in consequence of confusion,<br>\
or shame, affecting one from the seeing a person,<br>\
and the emotion, or excitement, ensuing from the<br>\
hearing of singing, and the agitation of the passionate lover at his seeing the object of his love :<br>\
as a term of logic, it is one of the ten predicaments, i. e. passion, or suffering.] It is said that<br>\
to every فِعْل there is an اِنْفِعَال, except to the act<br>\
of creation, which proceeds from God; for this<br>\
is the bringing into existence from a state of nonexistence, not from matter [already existing to<br>\
receive the effect of the act]. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
افتعل عَلَيْهِ كَذِبًا (Mgh, * O, Msb, * K) and<br>\
زُورًا (O) He forged against him a lie. (Mgh, *<br>\
O, Msb, * K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence the phrase الخُطُوطُ<br>\
تُفْتَعَلُ i. e. [Handwritings] are forged, or falsified.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence] it used to be said, أَعْذَبُ<br>\
الأَغَانِى مَا افْتُعِلَ i. e. [The sweetest of songs is] such<br>\
as has been composed with originality, not in<br>\
imitation of any model: and أَظْرَفُ الشِّعْرِ مَاافْتُعِلَ<br>\
[The most eloquent of poetry is such as has been<br>\
so composed]. (TA.)<br>\
فَعْلٌ an inf. n. of 1. (S, O, Msb, K.)<br>\
-A2-  And<br>\
The vulva of the she-camel, and of any female.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
فِعْلٌ: see 1, in two places: [as a subst. from فَعَلَهُ]<br>\
it signifies [A deed, or an action: or] a motion<br>\
(حَرَكَةٌ) of a human being: (K:) or, as Sgh says,<br>\
the origination of anything, whether it be what is<br>\
termed عَمَلٌ [which means work or labour or service as well as a deed or an action] or other than<br>\
it; so that it is more general in application than<br>\
عَمَِلٌ: (TA:) or it is a metonymical term for any<br>\
عَمَل [meaning deed or action] that is transitive<br>\
(M, K, TA) or intransitive (M, TA:) or a<br>\
mode that is accidental to the producer of an<br>\
effect upon another [person or thing] by reason<br>\
of the producing of the effect at the first; as<br>\
the mode that ensues to the cutter by reason<br>\
of his being cutting: or, as Er-Rághib says,<br>\
the production of an effect considered with reference to an agent thereof; and it is common to<br>\
that which is by his, or its, origination or otherwise, and to that which is with knowledge or otherwise, and to that which is by intention or otherwise,<br>\
and to what proceeds from the human being or the<br>\
animal [of any kind] or the inanimate thing;<br>\
and عَمَلٌ and صُنْعٌ are more particular in application: El-Harállee says that the فِعْل is what has<br>\
become apparent in consequence of a motive of the<br>\
efficient, whether from knowledge or otherwise, by<br>\
reason of premeditation [for لِتَدَيُّن (an obvious<br>\
mistranscription in my original) I read لِتَدَبُّرٍ] or<br>\
otherwise: and El-Juweynee says that it is what<br>\
is within the limits of a small space of time, without repetition, or reiteration, whereas the عَمَل is<br>\
what has been repeated, or reiterated, and whereof<br>\
the time has been long; but this is repugned by<br>\
the trad. [in which occurs the saying], مَا فَعَلَ النُِّغَيْر<br>\
[expl. in art. نغر]; (TA:) the pl. is فِعَالٌ (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K) and أَفْعَالٌ [a pl. of pauc.], (O, TA,)<br>\
[and أَفَاعِيلُ is app. a pl. pl., i. e. pl. of أَفْعَالٌ, like<br>\
أقَاوِيلُ pl. of أَقْوَالٌ which is pl. of قَوْلٌ, and many<br>\
other instances]: you say, إِنَّ الرِّشَا تَفْتَلُ الأَفَاعِيلَ<br>\
وَتُنْسِى إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ [Verily bribes do great<br>\
deeds, and cause the receivers to forget the principles of Ibráheem and Ismá&#39;eel, who are esteemed<br>\
models of true religion]. (TA. [This saying is<br>\
written in my original without any vowel-signs,<br>\
perhaps because well known: and it is there<br>\
added that الافاعيل may be pl. of افعول (which<br>\
has been altered by the copyist and is probably a<br>\
mistranscription for أَفْعُولَةٌ) or of افعال; with<br>\
other remarks equally doubtful and unimportant.])<br>\
[Hence, بِالفِعْلِ meaning Actually; as opposed to<br>\
بِالقُوَّةِ i. e. potentially, or virtually.] ―<br>\
-b2-  As used<br>\
by the grammarians, it means [A verb; i. e.]<br>\
what denotes a meaning in itself together with any<br>\
one of the three times [past and present and<br>\
future: but it should be observed that it includes<br>\
the مَصْدَر, or infinitive noun; and also that there<br>\
is what is termed فِعْلٌ ناقِصٌ an incomplete, i. e.<br>\
non-attributive, verb (as كَانَ coordinate to صَارَ,<br>\
&amp;c.); as well as what is termed فِعْلٌ تَامٌّ a complete, i. e. attributive, verb]. (TA.)<br>\
فَعْلَةٌ A single فِعْل [i. e. deed or action], (Msb,<br>\
TA,) with fet-h. (Msb.) Thus in the saying in<br>\
the Kur [xxvi. 18], وَفَعَلْتَ فَعْلَتَكَ ااَّتِى فَعَلْتَ [lit.<br>\
And thou hast done thy one deed that thou hast<br>\
done]; as though the speaker said, فَتَلْتَ النَّفْسَ<br>\
قَتْللَتَكَ: in which Esh-Shaabee read ↓ فِعْلَتَكَ [thy<br>\
kind of deed], with kesr, as meaning فَتَلْتَ القِتْلَةَ<br>\
الَّتِى قَدْ عَرَفْتَهَا: so says Zj; but he adds that the<br>\
former reading is better. (TA.) And [hence<br>\
also] one says, كَانَتْ مِنْهُ فَعْلَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ or قَبِيحَةٌ<br>\
[A good single deed proceeded from him or a bad<br>\
one]. (S, O, TA.)<br>\
فِعْلَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
فَعِلَةٌ A custom, manner, habit, or wont. (K.)<br>\
[<br>\
فِعْلِىٌّ Of, or relating to, a verb.]<br>\
[<br>\
فِعْلِيَّةٌ The quality of a verb.]<br>\
فَعَالٌ, like نَزَالِ, has sometimes occurred as<br>\
meaning اِفْعَلْ [Do thou]. (O, K. *)<br>\
فَعَالٌ, (O, K,) accord. to Lth, (O,) is a name<br>\
for A good doing, such as liberality, or bounty,<br>\
(O,) and generosity, (O, K, [the only meaning<br>\
assigned to it in the S,]) and the like of these:<br>\
(O:) or, (O, K,) accord. to IAar, (O,) the<br>\
doing of a single person, peculiarly, [as distinguished from فِعَالٌ, q. v.,] (O,) relating to good<br>\
and to evil; (O, K;) one says, فُلَانٌ كَرِيمُ الفَعَالِ<br>\
[Such a one is generous in respect of doing or<br>\
doings], and فُلَانٌ لَئِيمُ الفَعَالِ [Such a one is<br>\
mean in respect of doing or doings]; (O: [and<br>\
the like is said in the T and in the Msb;]) and<br>\
Az says that this is the correct explanation: not<br>\
that of Lth; and Mbr [likewise] says, it is used<br>\
in commendation and in discommendation: (O:)<br>\
and it is used only of a single agent. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
It is also an inf. n. (S, O, Msb. [See 1, first sentence.])<br>\
فِعَالٌ, as distinguished from فَعَالٌ, signifies A<br>\
doing that is between two [agents]; (IAar, O, K,<br>\
TA;) and therefore it is an inf. n. of ↓ فَاعَلَ [a<br>\
verb of which I have not found any ex.]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  It is also a pl. of فِعْلٌ. (S, O, Msb, K.<br>\
-A2-<br>\
Also The handle, (K,) or piece of wood that is inserted into the hole, (IAar, IB, O,) of the axe, or<br>\
adz, or hoe: (IAar, IB, O, K:) pl. فُعُلٌ. (K.)<br>\
فُعَالَةُ (with damm, O, TA, [in the CK, erroneously, فَعالَةُ,]) A metonymical appellation substituted for خُزَاعَةُ, (O, K, TA,) the well-known<br>\
tribe [thus named]. (TA.)<br>\
فَعَّالٌ [Wont to do]. (Kur xi. 109 and lxxxv.<br>\
16. [Thus in the phrase فَعَّالٌ لِمَا يُرِيدُ Wont to<br>\
do what He willeth: relating to God.])<br>\
فَاعِلٌ [act. part. n. of 1, Doing: and, used as<br>\
a subst., a doer: and hence] a carpenter is thus<br>\
called; accord. to IAar: but it is now peculiarly<br>\
applied to such as works with clay, [and builds,<br>\
and plasters,] and digs foundations: (TA:) and<br>\
[the pl.] فَعَلَةٌ, (Mgh, K, TA,) as an epithet in<br>\
which the quality of a subst. predominates, is<br>\
applied to workers in clay and digging and the<br>\
like; (K, TA;) or such as work with their hands<br>\
in clay or building or digging; like عَمَلَةٌ [pl. of<br>\
عَامِلٌ]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَكُنَّا فَاعِلِينَ, in the Kur [xxi.<br>\
79], means And we were able to do what we<br>\
willed. (O, TA.) And وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِلزَّكٰوةِ<br>\
فَاعِلُونَ, in the same [xxiii. 4], means And who<br>\
give the ذكوة [or poor-rate]: (Zj, O, TA:) or,<br>\
as some say, who do that which is good, or<br>\
righteous. (O, TA.)<br>\
مُفْتَعَلٌ A writing forged, or falsified. (Mgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And Poetry composed with originality, not in<br>\
imitation of any model. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  جَآءَ بِالْمُفْتَعَلِ,<br>\
meaning It produced a grievous, or distressing,<br>\
effect, (K, TA,) is a phrase mentioned by IAar,<br>\
as used by Ed-Dubeyree when asked respecting<br>\
a wound that he had received and that rendered<br>\
him sleepless, and as used by him in respect of<br>\
anything [unprecedented]: thus one says, عَذَّبَنِى<br>\
وَجَعٌ أَسْهَرَنِى فَجَآءَ بِالْمُفْتَعَلِ i. e. [A malady that<br>\
rendered me sleepless, tormented me,] and produced pain that had not been known before.<br>\
