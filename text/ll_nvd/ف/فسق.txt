فَسَقَ is said to signify primarily It (a thing)<br>\
went forth, from another thing, in a bad, or corrupt, manner. (Msb.) One says, فَسَقَتِ الرُّطَبَةُ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb,) or فَسَقَتِ الرُّطَبَةُ عَنْ قِشْرِهَا, (K,) The<br>\
fresh ripe date came forth from its skin; (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K;) as also ↓ انفسقت: (IDrd, O, K:) and<br>\
in like manner فَسَقَ is said of anything as meaning it came forth from its integument: so says EsSarakustee. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence] فَسَقَ, aor.<br>\
فَسُقَ and<br>\
فَسِقَ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K) the latter aor. mentioned by Akh,<br>\
(S, O, Msb,) inf. n. فُسُوقٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K)<br>\
and فِسْقٌ, (S, O, K,) or this latter is a simple<br>\
subst.; (Msb;) and likewise فَسُقَ, like كَرُمَ, (K,<br>\
TA,) mentioned by Lh, but not known by Ks;<br>\
(TA;) He went forth from, departed from, or<br>\
quitted, (Mgh, Msb, K,) the right way, (Mgh, K,)<br>\
or the way of truth, (K,) and the limits of the law,<br>\
(Mgh,) [or the bounds of] obedience; (Msb;) he<br>\
forsook, relinquished, or neglected, the command of<br>\
God; he disobeyed; (K;) or i. q. فَجَرَ [meaning<br>\
as above; or he transgressed; or acted unrighteously, sinfully, wickedly, vitiously, or immorally].<br>\
(S, O, K. [See also فِسْقٌ below.]) فَسَقَ عَنْ أَمْرِرَبِّهِ<br>\
(in the Kur [xviii. 48], O, TA) means He departed (خَرَجَ) from the command of his Lord:<br>\
(Th, S, O, K:) or from the obeying [of the command] of his Lord: (Fr, O, TA:) and Akh says<br>\
that this phrase is like اِتَّخَمَ عن الطَّعامِ, (S, O,)<br>\
meaning عَنْ مَأْكَلِهِ, (S,) or عَنْ أَكْلِهِ الطَّعَامَ; but<br>\
Th says that there is no need of this [explanation]:<br>\
or, accord. to AO, it means he declined, or deviated, from obeying the command of his Lord:<br>\
(O:) for فَسَقَ signifies also he declined, or deviated:<br>\
(K:) and hence the saying, فَسَقَتِ الرِّكَابُ عَنْ قَصْدِ<br>\
السَّبِيلِ i. e. [The ridden camels] declined [from<br>\
the right direction of the way]. (TA.) Sometimes<br>\
فُسُوقٌ may mean The believing in a plurality of<br>\
gods: and it may mean the committing sin. (A<br>\
Heyth, O.) And it is said to mean The calling<br>\
one another by names of reproach: (Zj, * Mgh,<br>\
TA:) or the saying “ O Jew,” and “ O Christian,” after one has become a believer: thus in<br>\
the Kur xlix. 11. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  One says also, فَسَقَ فِى<br>\
الدُّنْيَا, inf. n. فِسْقٌ, meaning He had a wide, or an<br>\
ample, range in respect of worldly things, and<br>\
made them light and easy to himself, being without restraint in his management of them, not<br>\
making them strait to him. (Ktr, Sh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And فَسَقَ مَالَهُ He made away with his property;<br>\
and disposed of it, or spent it. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
تَفْسِيقٌ is the contr. of تَعْدِيلٌ: (O, K, TA:)<br>\
one says فسّقهُ, (O, TA,) inf. n. تَفْسِيقٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
(the judge) pronounced him to be characterized by<br>\
فِسْق [q. v.]: (O, TA:) he attributed to him فِسْق.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْفَسَقَ see 1, second sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] انفسق<br>\
مِنَ الخَيْرِ, said of the فَاسِق, He divested himself,<br>\
or became divested, of good. IDrd, O.)<br>\
فِسْقٌ is an inf. n., (S, O, K,) or a simple subst.,<br>\
(Msb,) from فَسَقَ [q. v]: (S, O, Msb, K:) unless<br>\
as signifying [simply] A going forth, or a departure, it is said to be a word unknown before ElIslám, and to have become so much used in its<br>\
legal acceptation as to be, when so used, conventionally regarded as proper (MF, TA:) [thus<br>\
used,] it signifies a going forth, or departure, from<br>\
the right way, (K, TA,) which is said to be the<br>\
primary meaning, (TA,) or from the way of truth;<br>\
(K, TA;) or from the truth, or that which is<br>\
right, as in the phrase وَإِنَّهُ لَفِسْقٌ, (O, K, [in the<br>\
CK لَفَسِقٌ, a strange mistake,]) in the Kur [vi.<br>\
121]; (O;) or a relinquishment, or neglect, of the<br>\
command of God; (Lth, O, K;) and an inclining<br>\
to disobedience; (Lth, O;) or also disobedience<br>\
[itself]; (K;) or i. q. فُجُورٌ [meaning as above;<br>\
or transgression; or unrighteous, sinful, wicked,<br>\
vitious, or immoral, conduct]: (O, K:) it is said<br>\
by El-Isbahánee to be a more general term than<br>\
كُفْرٌ; applying to few sins, misdeeds, transgressions, or acts of disobedience, or to little thereof;<br>\
and also, to many, or much thereof; but is commonly known as applying to the latter: and it is<br>\
related on the authority of Málik that in the Kur<br>\
vi. 146 it means such as is slaughtered: (TA:)<br>\
[being used as a subst.,] it sometimes has a pl.,<br>\
which is فُسُوقٌ. (TA.)<br>\
فُسَقٌ (Lth, O, K) and ↓ فِسِّيقٌ, (Lth, S, O, K,)<br>\
applied to a man, Always characterized by فِسْق.<br>\
(Lth, S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  يَافُسَقُ means يَا أَيُّهَا الفَاسِقُ<br>\
[O thou فَاسِق]; (S, O, K;) like يَا خُبَثُ, meaning يَا أَيُّهَا انخَبِيثُ; فُسَقُ being determinate, as is<br>\
shown by their saying يَا فُسَقُ الخَبِيثُ, thus prefixing ال to خبيث: (S, O:) and to a woman they<br>\
say ↓ يَا فَسَاقِ, like قَطَامِ, (S, O, K,) meaning<br>\
يَا فَاسِقَةُ (K) [or rather يَا أَيُّهَا الفَاسِقَةُ].<br>\
فَسْقِيَّةٌ, with fet-h, [often pronounced فِسْقِيَّة,] a<br>\
post-classical word, [arabicized, from the Lat.<br>\
“ piscina,”] i. q. مُتَوَضَّأٌ [properly A place, here<br>\
meaning a tank, or basin, in which the ablution<br>\
termed وُضُوْء is performed: now commonly applied<br>\
to a basin, or shallow pool, of water, in the court<br>\
of a house, or in a room, generally having in the<br>\
centre a fountain that throws up water:] pl.<br>\
فَسَاقِيُّ. (TA.)<br>\
فَسَاقِ: see فُسَقٌ<br>\
فِسِّيقٌ: see فُسَقٌ<br>\
فَاسِقٌ Going forth, or departing, or one who<br>\
goes forth, or departs, [from the right way, or the<br>\
way of truth, and the limits of the law, or] from<br>\
[the bounds of] obedience; (Msb;) disobedient [to<br>\
God]; (Mgh, TA;) [transgressing, or a transgressor; unrighteous, sinful, wicked, vitious, or<br>\
immoral;] mostly applied to one who has taken<br>\
upon himself to observe what the law ordains, and<br>\
has acknowledged its authority, and then fallen<br>\
short of observance in respect of all, or of some, of<br>\
its ordinances: and when the person fundamentally, or utterly, an unbeliever is thus termed, it<br>\
is because he falls short of observing the ordinance<br>\
that the intellect renders obligatory on him and<br>\
that the natural constitution with which he was<br>\
created in his mother&#39;s womb requires to be conceded; hence the believer is contrasted with him<br>\
in the Kur xxxii. 18; so فَاسِقٌ is a more general<br>\
term than كَافِرٌ; and ظَالِمٌ is a more general term<br>\
than فَاسِقٌ: (El-Isbahánee, TA:) accord. to IDrd,<br>\
(O,) the فَاسِق is thus called because of his divesting himself, or becoming divested, of good: (O,<br>\
K:) the word has not been heard in the speech<br>\
of the people of the Time of Ignorance, (IAar,<br>\
S, O, Msb, K,) nor in their poetry, (IAar, S, O,<br>\
K,) though it is an Arabic word, (IAar, S, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) and a chaste one, and the Kur-án has<br>\
used it: (IAar, Msb:) the pl. is فَسَقَةٌ and فُسَّاقٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) فَوَاسِقُ, [pl. of فَاسِقَةٌ,] applied to women,<br>\
signifies فَوَاجِرُ [generally meaning adulteresses, or<br>\
fornicatresses]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The five animals, or<br>\
living things, (الحَيَوَانَاتُ الخَمْسُ, [specified voce<br>\
حَيَوَانٌ,]) are metaphorically termed فَوَاسِقُ [as<br>\
though meaning (tropical:)  Transgressors] (Mgh, Msb) because of their noxiousness, (Mgh,) or because of<br>\
their much, or frequent, noxiousness and harmfulness, so that they may be killed in the case of<br>\
freedom from إِحْرَام and in the state of إِحْرَام, and<br>\
in prayer, which is not rendered ineffectual thereby:<br>\
(Msb:) or because of their being out of the pale<br>\
of inviolability: or, as some [unreasonably] say,<br>\
because the eating of them is forbidden. (Mgh.)<br>\
فَاسِقِيَّةٌ A certain mode of attiring oneself with<br>\
the turban. (Z, O, K.) One says, تَعَمَّمَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
الفَاسِقيَّةَ [Such a one attired himself with the turban<br>\
in the mode termed الفاسقيّة]. (TA.)<br>\
الفُوَيْسِقَةُ The rat, or mouse; syn. الفَأْرَةُ: (S, O,<br>\
K:) so called because it comes forth from its hole<br>\
upon people: (O, K:) or, accord. to Z, because<br>\
it does mischief in houses: and it is said in a trad.<br>\
that it is to be killed: the word is the dim. of فَاسِقَةٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
أَفْسَقُ [More, or most, characterized by فِسْق].<br>\
The Arabs say, لَعَنَ اللّٰهُ أَفْسَقِى وأَفْسَقَكَ, meaning,<br>\
الأَفْسَقَ مِنَّا [i. e. May God curse the more characterized by فِسْق, of us, or of me and thee]. (Fr, O.)<br>\
