the latter meaning; mentioned by Ibn-&#39;Abbád. (O.)<br>\
فِرْزٌ: see فِرْزَةٌ, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also<br>\
فُرْزَةٌ. ―<br>\

فُرْزَةٌ A road in, or upon, an [eminence such as<br>\

فَرْوَازٌ [an arabicized word, from the Pers. پَرْوَاز,<br>\
app. as meaning A fringe, or the like; as the<br>\
latter word does in Turkish, and probably, sometimes, in Persian]: accord. to some, it is of the<br>\
measure فَعْلَالٌ from فَرَزَ in the first of the senses<br>\
expl. in this art.; therefore, if so, it is an Arabic<br>\
word: the pl. is فَرَاوِزُ. (TA.) See 1, last sentence.<br>\
فَارِزٌ A tongue distinct [in utterance]: (O, K,<br>\
TA:) and discriminating language. (A, * O, K, *<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A species of ant, round and black,<br>\
found in dates: so says Ibráheem El-Harbee:<br>\
(O and TA in art. عقف:) or the progenitor (جَدّ)<br>\
of the black ants: that of the red is termed عُقْفَان:<br>\
(K:) but it has been before said by the author of<br>\
the K, in art. فزر, that فَازِرٌ signifies “ black ants in<br>\
which is a redness: ” and it may be a mistranscription. (TA.)<br>\
فَارِزَةٌ A road taking its course in a tract of sand<br>\
amid sands that are compact and cleaving to the<br>\
ground, and soft, (O, K,) appearing like an<br>\
extended natural cleft in the ground: but this is<br>\
mentioned in the book of Lth in art. فزر [as<br>\
written فَازِرَة]. (O.)<br>\
أَفْرَزُ Humpbacked; as also أَفْرَسُ and أَفْرَصُ: so<br>\
says Fr. (TA voce أَعْجَرُ.) [The same meaning<br>\
is also assigned to أَفْزَرُ, q. v.]<br>\
إِفْرِيزٌ, of a wall, an arabicized word, (S, Mgh,<br>\
O, K,) [of unknown origin, like our word “ frieze,”<br>\
and the French “ frise,” &amp;c., said in the TA to<br>\
be from the Pers. پَرْوَاز, mentioned above, voce<br>\
فَرْوَازٌ,] A projecting appertenance or roof or covering (جَنَاحٌ) thereof; (Mgh;) the طُنُف [q. v.,<br>\
app. meaning a projecting coping, or ledge, or<br>\
cornice,] thereof; (O and K in the present art.,<br>\
and the same and S in art. طنف;) surrounding<br>\
the upper part: (Kr, TA voce زَيْفٌ:) [it is also<br>\
expl. as meaning] a hole, or an aperture, in a<br>\
wall. (KL. [But this is app. a mistake, caused<br>\
by a misunderstanding of the word طَاقٌ, which is<br>\
expl. as having this meaning and also as syn. with<br>\
إِفْرِيزٌ; and the author of the KL evidently doubted<br>\
its correctness, for he adds, “so we have<br>\
heard. ”])<br>\

مَفْرُوزٌ and ↓ مُفْرَزٌ Put, or set, apart, away, or<br>\
aside; removed; or separated: (Mgh:) divided<br>\
into parts, or shares. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  And the former,<br>\
Having the back broken; like مَفْرُوسٌ. (TA in<br>\
art. فرس.)<br>\
-A3-  ثَوْبٌ مَفْرُوزٌ, (S, O, K,) by some<br>\
written مُفَرْوَزٌ, (TA,) is from إِفْرِيزٌ, the افريز of a<br>\
wall, (S, TA,) and signifies [A garment, or piece<br>\
of cloth,] having تَطَارِيف [app. meaning a fringe,<br>\
or fringes; likened to fingers, or the ends of<br>\
fingers]. (O, K.) [See 1, last sentence.]<br>\
