فَحَا بِكَلَامِهِ إِلَى كَذَا, (Msb, TA,) aor. يَفْحُو<br>\
[like يَعْلُو], the verb being of the class of عَلَى,<br>\
(so in the Msb accord. to the TA,) or يَفْحَى [like<br>\
يَنْفَعُ], the verb being of the class of نَفَعَ, (so<br>\
accord. to my copy of the Msb,) or, as in copies<br>\
of the T, يَفْحِى, without teshdeed, the verb being<br>\
of the class of رَمَى, (TA, [but this is app. a mistranscription for يَفْحَى, as the last radical letter<br>\
is و,]) inf. n. فَحْوٌ; (Msb, TA;) or بكلامه ↓ فحّى<br>\
الى كذا, thus accord. to the K, agreeably with<br>\
what is said by J; (TA;) [but one of my copies<br>\
of the S has إِنَّهُ لَيَفْحَى بِكَلَامِهِ إِلَى كَذَا وَكَذَا;<br>\
the other copy having ↓ لَيُفَحِّى;] He meant, or<br>\
intended, by his saying, or speech, such a thing.<br>\
(Msb, K, TA. [In the S, the meaning is only<br>\
indicated by the context.])<br>\
-A2-  بَكَى حَتَّى فَحِىَ,<br>\
like رَضِىَ, He (a child) wept until he sobbed.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
فحّى القِدْرَ, inf. n. تَفْحِيَةٌ, He made the<br>\
cooking-pot to have a large quantity of أَبَازِير [or<br>\
seeds used in cooking, for seasoning the food: from<br>\
فَحًا, q. v.]: (S, * K, TA:) or, accord. to Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Alee El-Kálee, he put, or threw, into the cookingpot, أَبَازِير, i. e. تَوَابِل. (TA.) It is said, by Z,<br>\
[but with hardly any reason that I can see,] to<br>\
be formed by transposition from the letters فوح<br>\
thus combined. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
3<br>\
فَاحَيْتُهُ, inf. n. مُفَاحَاةٌ, I talked, discoursed,<br>\
or held a colloquy, with him, and understood what<br>\
he intended, or meant. (A, TA.)<br>\
فَحًا and فِحًى, (S, K,) the former of which is<br>\
the more common, (S,) The seeds that are used<br>\
in cooking, for seasoning the food; (S, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ فَحْوَآءُ: or the dry thereof: (K:) pl. أَفْحَآءٌ;<br>\
(S, K;) which is said by IAth to signify the<br>\
[seeds called] تَوَابِل of the cooking-pot, such as<br>\
pepper and cumin-seed and the like thereof. (TA.)<br>\
And it is said to signify particularly The onion,<br>\
or onions collectively. (TA.) Thus in a trad. of<br>\
Mo&#39;áwiyeh, in which he is related to have said<br>\
to a party who came to him, كُلُوا مِنْ فَحَا أَرْضِنَا<br>\
فَقَلَّ مَا أَكَلَ قَوْمٌ مِنْ فَحَا أَرْضٍ فَضَرَّهُمْ مَاؤُهَا [Eat<br>\
ye of the seasoning of our land (meaning of the<br>\
onions,) for rarely have people eaten of the seasoning of a land and the water thereof has harmed<br>\
them]. (TA: and the like is said in the S, but<br>\
not so fully.)<br>\
فَحْوَةٌ i. q. شَهْدَةٌ [A portion of honey; or a<br>\
honey-comb; or a portion of a honey-comb]. (K,<br>\
TA. [It is added in the latter that it is as though<br>\
it were formed by transposition from فَوْحَة; which<br>\
I do not find in this sense in any lexicon.])<br>\
فَحْيَةٌ, like جَرْيَةٌ; (so in some copies of the K,<br>\
and accord. to the TA, in which it is said to be<br>\
“ with fet-h; ”) or فِحْيَةٌ, like جِرْيَةٌ; (so in other<br>\
copies of the K; [but I think that both are evidently wrong, because deviating from a common<br>\
rule of the K, and for more than one other obvious<br>\
reason; and that the right reading is ↓ فِحِّيَّةٌ, like<br>\
جِرِّيَّةٌ (accord. to those who hold this to be of the<br>\
measure فِعِّيلَةٌ, not فِعْلِيَّةٌ); i. e., that it is originally فِحِّيوَةٌ, the و being necessarily changed into<br>\
ى and incorporated into the preceding ى;] and<br>\
also ↓ فَحِيَّةٌ; (K, TA;) the former on the authority of AA, and the latter on that of IAar; (TA;)<br>\
Thin soup: (K, TA: [in some copies of the K,<br>\
حَشْو is erroneously put for حَسْو or حَسُوّ, the<br>\
readings in other copies:]) or soup in general.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
فَحْوَى and ↓ فَحْوَآءُ, (T, S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) the<br>\
latter sometimes used, (Msb,) but AZ is said to<br>\
have disallowed the pronunciation with the lengthened alif, (TA,) and ↓ فُحَوَآءُ, (K, TA,) this last<br>\
mentioned by ISd and Sgh on the authority of<br>\
Fr, (TA,) The meaning of a saying, or speech;<br>\
its intended sense or import; syn. مَعْنًى; (S, Msb,<br>\
K;) and مَذْهَبٌ; (K;) and لَحْنٌ. (S, Msb.) One<br>\
says, عَرَفْتُهُ, (S, A,) or فَهِمْتُهُ, (Msb,) فِى, (S,) or<br>\
مِنْ, (A, Msb,) فَحْوَى كَلَامِهِ and كَلَامِهِ ↓ فَحْوَآءِ<br>\
(S, A, Msb) i. e. [I knew it, or I understood it,<br>\
in, or from, the intended sense or import of his<br>\
saying, or speech; or,] in [or from] what I elicited<br>\
of his meaning, or intent, in what he said. (A.)<br>\
[See also عَرُوضٌ, near the middle of the paragraph.]<br>\
فَحْوَآءُ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
two places:<br>\
-A2-  see also فَحًا.<br>\
فُحَوَآءٌ: see فَحْوَى.<br>\
فَحِيَّةٌ and فِحِّيَّةٌ: see فَحْيَةٌ, above.<br>\
أَفْحَى i. q. أَبَحُّ [Having a hoarse, rough, harsh,<br>\
or gruff, voice]. (Sgh, TA.)<br>\
