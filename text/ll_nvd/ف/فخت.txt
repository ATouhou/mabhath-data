فَخَتَتْ, said of a woman, She walked with<br>\
an elegant and a proud and self-conceited gait,<br>\
with an affected inclining of the body from side to<br>\
side. (Msb.) [See also 5.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And, said of the<br>\
bird called فَاخِتَة, It [cooed, or] uttered a cry or<br>\
sound. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فَخَتَ He lied, or uttered a<br>\
falsehood. (A, TA. [See فَاخِتَةٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  فَخَتَهُ, aor.<br>\
فَخَتَ,<br>\
He cut it off (K, TA) with a sword. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
فَخَتَ رَأْسَهُ He smote his head with a sword, (O,<br>\
K, TA,) and cut it off. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  فَخَتَ الإِنَآءَ,<br>\
(K, TA,) inf. n. فَخْتٌ, (TA,) He uncovered the<br>\
vessel. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And الفَخْتُ signifies also<br>\
The cook&#39;s taking out with the hand a piece of<br>\
flesh-meat from the cooking-pot: (K, TA:) مِنَ<br>\
القِدْرَةِ, the reading found in copies of the K, [in<br>\
the CK من الفِدْرَةِ,] is a mistake: it should be<br>\
من القِدْرِ, as in the L [and O] &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تفخّت He walked in the manner of the bird<br>\
called فَاخِتَة: thus in the K: but in most of the<br>\
lexicons تَفَخَّتَتْ: (TA:) i. e. she (a woman)<br>\
walked as walks the فَاخِتَة: (A:) [or,] accord. to<br>\
Lth, [in the &#39;Eyn,] signifying مشت مجنبحة:<br>\
(TA: in the O, مَشَتْ مجنحه; and in the<br>\
margin thereof, مُجَنْبِخَةً: [the right reading is<br>\
مَشَتْ مُجْتَنِحَةً; thus in the JK, a lexicon founded<br>\
upon the &#39;Eyn:] thought by him to be from the<br>\
walking of the bird called فَاخِتَة: (O, * TA:) he<br>\
means, she strode in her walking, and held out her<br>\
arms apart from [her sides beneath] her armpits.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He wondered, syn. تَعَجَّبَ, (O, K,<br>\
TA,) and said, How good, or goodly, is he, or it!<br>\
(O, TA.) And it is said of a man as signifying<br>\
تعجّب فِى مِشْيَتِهِ [app. meaning He showed عُجْب,<br>\
i. e. self-admiration, &amp;c., in his gait: but I do not<br>\
find this signification assigned to تعجّب]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And He affected lying; or lied purposely;<br>\
syn. تَكَذَّبَ. (A, TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انفخت, said of a roof, It became perforated.<br>\
(O, K.)<br>\
فَخْتٌ The light of the moon; moonlight: (S,<br>\
A, O, K:) or the light of the moon when it first<br>\
appears: and hence [as some say] the derivation<br>\
of فَاخِتَةٌ [as the name of a certain bird], because<br>\
of its colour: (Msb: [see, however, what follows:])<br>\
you say, جَلَسْنَا فِى الفَخْتِ [as though meaning<br>\
We sat in the moonlight]: (A &#39;Obeyd, S, O:) but<br>\
Sh says, I have not heard الفِخْت except in this<br>\
instance; and Aboo-Is-hák states that some one<br>\
of the lexicologists says, I know not whether it<br>\
be a name of the light of the moon or of its darkness: Abu-l-&#39;Abbás says that the meaning [in the<br>\
saying above mentioned] is, in the shade of the<br>\
moon [i. e. in the shade of a moonlight-night; and<br>\
to this the colour of the فَاخِتَة may be likened].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The [snare, or trap, &amp;c., called]<br>\
فَخّ, (K, TA,) of the sportsman: (TA:) or [a<br>\
thing] nearly resembling the فَخّ. (O.)<br>\
-A3-  And<br>\
Holes, or perforations, of a round form, in a<br>\
roof. (O, K.)<br>\
فَاخِتَةٌ A certain well-known bird; (K;) of those<br>\
having neck-rings [or collars]; (S, O;) a species<br>\
of pigeon, marked with a neck-ring: (TA:)<br>\
accord. to Ibn-El-Jawáleekee, (IB, TA,) the<br>\
name is derived from الفَخْتُ, (IB, Msb, TA,)<br>\
meaning “ the light of the moon,” (IB, TA,) or<br>\
“ the light of the moon when it first appears; ”<br>\
because of its colour: (Msb:) [hence, and from<br>\
what will be found stated voce قُمْرِىٌّ, it seems to<br>\
be a species of collared turtle-dove, of a dull white<br>\
colour, marked with a black neck-ring:] or, as<br>\
some say, the word is a part. n. from فَخَتَتْ signifying as expl. in the first sentence of this art.:<br>\
(Msb:) the pl. is فَوَاخِتُ. (S, O, Msb.) أَكْذَبُ<br>\
مِنْ فَاخِتَةٍ [More lying than a fákhiteh] is a prov.;<br>\
because the cry of the فاختة resembles هٰذَا أَوَانُ<br>\
الرُّطَبِ [This is the season of the fresh ripe dates];<br>\
and this it utters when the spadix of the palmtree has not yet come forth. (Meyd. [See also<br>\
Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 383.])<br>\
