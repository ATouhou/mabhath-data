اِفْتَأَتَ عَلَىّ He said of me what was false:<br>\
(AZ, S, O:) or افتأت عَلَىَّ البَاطِلَ he forged against<br>\
me what was false: (K:) and افتأت عَلَىَّ مَا لَمْ أَقُلْ<br>\
he forged against me what I did not say. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  And افتأت عَلَيْنَا He was alone in his opinion<br>\
against us; none sharing it with him: (ISh, T,<br>\
TA:) or افتأت بِرَأْيِهِ he was alone, or singular,<br>\
in his opinion: (ISk, S, O, K:) and in like<br>\
manner in his affair, or case. (ISk, TA.) This<br>\
verb, thus used, (not known to Az with a radical<br>\
hemz in this sense except as mentioned by ISh<br>\
and ISk, TA,) is mentioned with hemz by AA<br>\
and AZ and ISk and others: it is therefore not<br>\
from الفَوْتُ, unless it be an instance of the application of hemz to that to which it does not<br>\
properly belong, as in the cases of حَلَّأْتُ السَّوِيقَ,<br>\
and لَبَّأْتُ بِالحَجِّ, and رَثَأْتُ المَيِّتَ. (S, O.) [See<br>\
also art. فوت.]<br>\
-A3-  اُفْتُئِتَ, in the pass form, He<br>\
(a man, O) died suddenly: (O, K:) but this,<br>\
app., [if not a mistake for اُفْتُلِتَ,] should be<br>\
اُفْتِيتَ, without hemz, from مَوْتُ الفَوَاتِ. (TA.)<br>\
فُؤَيْتٌ, applied to a man and to a woman, One<br>\
who follows his, or her, own opinion only. (From<br>\
a marg. note in a copy of the S. [Thus pronounced by AZ: by others, فُوَيْتٌ, without<br>\
hemz: see art. فوت.])<br>\
