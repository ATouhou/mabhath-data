فَآءَ, aor. يَفِىْءُ, inf. n. فَىْءٌ (S, O, Msb) and<br>\
فُيُوْءٌ, (O,) He (a man, Msb) returned; (S, O,<br>\
Msb;) and so ↓ افآء, and ↓ استفآء: (M, TA:) فَىْءٌ,<br>\
as also ↓ فَيْئَةٌ and ↓ فِيئَةٌ, [or the former of these,<br>\
accord. to analogy, is an inf. n. of unity, and the<br>\
latter an inf. n. of modality,] and إِفَآءَةٌ and اِستِفَآءَةٌ<br>\
al&#39; signify رُجُوعٌ: (K:) or, accord. to some, فَآءَ<br>\
signifies particularly he returned to a good state<br>\
or condition. (MF, TA.) One says, فَآءَ مِنْ<br>\
غَضَبِهِ He returned [to a good state, or recovered,<br>\
from his anger]: (M, TA:) and فُلَانٌ سَرِيعُ الفَىْءِ<br>\
مِنْ غَضَبِهِ [Such a one is quick in respect of the<br>\
returning &amp;c. from his anger]: (S, M, * O:) and<br>\
↓ إِنَّهُ لَسَرِيعُ الفِيْئَةِ, (M,) or ↓ لَحَسَنُ الفِيْئَةِ, (S, O,)<br>\
i. e. [Verily he is quick, or good, in respect of]<br>\
the returning [to a good state, or from his anger,<br>\
or in respect of the manner of returning &amp;c.]: (S,<br>\
M, O:) and ↓ هُوَ سَرِيعُ الغَضَبِ سَرِيعُ الفِيْئَةِ [He<br>\
is quick in respect of anger, quick in respect of<br>\
returning, or recovering, therefrom]. (A, TA.)<br>\
And فَآءَ إِلَى الأَمْرِ, and فَآءَهُ [i. e. فَآءَ الأَمْرَ], inf. n.<br>\
فَىْءٌ and فُيُوْءٌ, He returned [to the affair, or to<br>\
the command, i. e. to that which was commanded].<br>\
(M, TA.) حَتَّى تَفِىْءَ إِلَى أَمْرِ اللّٰهِ , in the Kur<br>\
xlix. 9, means Until it [referring to a party (طَائِفَة)<br>\
before mentioned] return to the ordinance of God,<br>\
or to that which God has commanded: (Bd:) or<br>\
until it return (T, Msb) to obedience, (T,) or to<br>\
that which is right. (Msb.) And فَآءَ إِلَى الأَمْرِ,<br>\
inf. n. فَىْءٌ, signifies also He reconsidered the<br>\
affair, or case. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  فَآءَ المُؤْلِى (M, Msb,<br>\
K) مِنِ امْرَأَتِهِ, (M, K,) inf. n. فَىْءٌ, (TA,) or<br>\
↓ فَيْئَةٌ, (Msb,) means The man who had sworn to<br>\
abstain from conjugal intercourse with his wife<br>\
expiated his oath and returned to her. (M, Msb, *<br>\
K. [See Kur ii. 226.]) But MF observes that<br>\
this usage of فَآءَ to signify He expiated an oath<br>\
belongs to the conventional language of the law.<br>\
(TA.) In the case of a man who has sworn that<br>\
he will abstain from conjugal intercourse with his<br>\
wife, a period of four months is appointed to him<br>\
in the Kur-án; and if he have such intercourse<br>\
with her in the four months, it is said of him,<br>\
قَدْ فَآءَ, meaning He has returned [or reverted]<br>\
from his oath, to the doing that which he swore<br>\
that he would not do, and is bound to expiate<br>\
his oath: if he have not had such intercourse<br>\
with her until the end of the four months from<br>\
the day of his swearing, then, Ibn-&#39;Abbás and a<br>\
number of the Companions pass upon her a single<br>\
sentence of divorce, making the [said sentence of]<br>\
divorce to have effect at the end of the months;<br>\
but many of the Companions and others say that<br>\
in this case he must return, and expiate his oath,<br>\
or he must divorce. (T, TA.) And [hence] one<br>\
says ↓ لَهُ عَلَى امْرَأَتِهِ فَيْئَةٌ He has the right of<br>\
returning to his wife: (Msb, TA:) and هُوَ يَمْلِكُ<br>\
↓ فَيْئَتَهَا He possesses the right of returning to her;<br>\
namely, a wife whom he has divorced. (A, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  الفَىْءُ عَلَى ذِى الرَّحِمِ occurs in a trad. as<br>\
meaning The being favourably inclined, or affectionate, to the relation; and returning to kind<br>\
treatment of him. (TA.) ―<br>\

K, *) It shifted, or removed; (M, K; *) or [rather]<br>\
it returned from the side of the west to the side of<br>\
the east: (Msb:) and الظِّلَالُ ↓ تَفَيَّأَتِ The shades<br>\
became changed in their manner of being; (S, O;)<br>\
or [rather] they returned [towards the east] after<br>\
midday. (T, TA. [See the Kur-án xvi. 50.]) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And فَآءَتِ الشَّجَرَةُ; and ↓ تفيّأت; (M;) and ↓ فيّأت,<br>\
inf. n. تَفِيْئَةٌ; (S, O, TA;) The tree had much<br>\
shade. (M, TA.) فَآءَتِ الحَدِيدَةُ The iron implement became blunt after its being sharp. (T, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  فِئْتُ الغَنِيمَةَ, (mentioned, but not expl., in the<br>\
K,) inf. n. فَىْءٌ, (TA,) means I took the spoil.<br>\
(TK.) [See also 10.]<br>\
2<br>\
فيّأ الظِلَّ, and ↓ افآءهُ He (God) made the<br>\

MF, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  قَيَّأَت said of a tree: see 1, near the<br>\
end. ―<br>\
-b2-  Said of the wind, It put in motion the<br>\
seed-produce, or standing corn, and the trees.<br>\

TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَفَأْتُهُ I made it to return. (O.) See also 2.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, أَفَآءَ اللّٰهُ عَلَى المُسْلِمِينَ<br>\
مَالَ الكُفَّارِ [God restored to the Muslims, as though<br>\
it were theirs by right, or gave to them as spoil,<br>\
the property, or wealth, of the unbelievers]; (S,<br>\
O;) inf. n. إِفَآءَةٌ. (S.) And أَفَآءَ اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِمُ<br>\
الغَنَائِمَ [God restored, or gave, to them the spoils].<br>\
And أَفَآءَ عَلَى قَوْمٍ فَيْئًا He took for a party the<br>\
spoil of another party and brought it to them:<br>\
and he took for a party spoil that had been taken<br>\
from them. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And أَفَأْتُ كَذَا I made<br>\
such a thing to be a فَىْء [or spoil]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
أَفَأْتُ فُلَانًا عَلَى الأَمْرِ I turned him to the thing, or<br>\
affair, when he had desired another thing, or<br>\
affair. (AZ, T.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, first sentence.<br>\
5<br>\
تَفَيَّأَتِ الظِّلَالُ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and تفيّأت الشَّجَرَةُ: see 1, near<br>\
the end. ―<br>\
-b3-  تفيّأ فِيهِ means He shaded himself in<br>\
it; i. e., in the shade termed فَىْء. (M.) One<br>\
says, تَفَيَّأْتُ فِى فَىْءِ الشَّجَرَةِ [I shaded myself in<br>\
the afternoon-shade of the tree]. (S, O.) And تفيّأ<br>\
بِالشَّجَرَةِ [He shaded himself by means of the tree;<br>\
or] he entered into the أَفْيَآء [or afternoon-shades]<br>\
of the tree: (MA:) and [it is said that] تَفَيَّأْتُ<br>\
الشَّجَرَةَ signifies I entered into the أَفْيَآء of the tree,<br>\
and shaded myself thereby: (Har p. 500:) and<br>\
Aboo-Temmám has made it trans. by itself [i. e.<br>\
without a prep.] in his saying,<br>\
فَتَفَيَّأْتُ ظِلَّهُ مَمْدُودًا<br>\
[as though meaning And I protected myself from<br>\
the sun by its shade, when it was extended]: but<br>\
[perhaps he has thus used the verb in the last of<br>\
the senses here following, for] it is said that this<br>\
is irregular. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence] one says, تَفَيَّأْتُ<br>\
بِفَيْئِكَ meaning (tropical:)  I have had recourse to thee for<br>\
protection. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  تفيّأ is said of a branch<br>\
or twig [as meaning It bent, in a languid<br>\
manner]. (T, M, L, K, voce تَرَأَّدَ; &amp;c.) And<br>\
one says, تفيّأت لِزَوْجِهَا, meaning She bent herself<br>\
over her husband, and affected languor, or languidness, to him, feigning coyness, or opposition,<br>\
and threw herself upon him: (T, * TA:) from<br>\
الفَىْءُ signifying “ the act of returning: ” and<br>\
some say تقيّأت, with ق; but Az says that this<br>\
is a mistake, and that it is correctly with ف<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  تفيّأ signifies also تَتَبَّعَ [He sought a<br>\
thing time after time, or repeatedly, &amp;c.]. (Har<br>\

فَىْءٌ Afternoon-shade; shade after the declining<br>\
of the sun from the meridian; (T, * S, O;) [i. e.]<br>\
the فَىْء is what was sun, and has been annulled,<br>\
or superseded, by shade; (M, K;) or that from<br>\
which the sun has departed: so called because of<br>\
its “ returning ” from side to side: (S, O: [see 1,<br>\
first sentence:]) ISk says, (S, O,) the ظِلّ is<br>\
what sun has annulled, or superseded; [correctly,<br>\
what sun annuls, or supersedes; (see ظَلٌّ;)] and<br>\
the فَىْء is what has annulled, or superseded, sun:<br>\
(S, Mgh, O:) but AO says, on the authority of<br>\
Ru-beh, that on which the sun has been and from<br>\
which it has departed is فَىْء and ظِلّ; and that<br>\
on which the sun has not been is ظِلّ: (S, O:)<br>\
[see more under this latter word:] pl. [of pauc.]<br>\
أَفْيَآءٌ and [of mult,] فُيُوْءٌ. (S, M, Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Spoil, booty, or plunder; syn. غَنِيمَةٌ<br>\
[q. v.]; (S, M, Mgh, O, Msb, K;) thus called,<br>\
by the inf. n., because it returns from one party<br>\
to another; (Msb;) and فَيٌّ in this sense is not<br>\
allowable; (Mgh, Msb;) nor is it in the preceding sense: (Mgh:) or such as is obtained<br>\
without difficulty: and therefore likened to shade.<br>\
(MF.) And The [tax, or tribute, termed] خَرَاج<br>\
[q. v.]: (S, O, K:) frequently occurring in trads.<br>\
as meaning such, of the possessions of the unbelievers,<br>\
as accrues to the Muslims without war: (TA:) or<br>\
such as is obtained from the believers in a plurality<br>\
of gods after the laying-down of arms: (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
Mgh and Msb voce غَنِيمَةٌ:) or such as God has<br>\
restored [as though it were theirs of right] to the<br>\
people of his religion, of the possessions of those<br>\
who have opposed them, without fighting, either<br>\
by the latter&#39;s quitting their homes and leaving<br>\
them vacant to the Muslims, or by their making<br>\
peace on the condition of paying a poll-tax or<br>\
other money or property to save themselves from<br>\
slaughter: such is termed فَىْء in the Kur-án.<br>\
(T. [See more under غَنِيمَةٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  Also A flock of<br>\
birds: (O, K:) [or a number of birds disposed in<br>\
a row:] also termed عَرَقَةٌ and صَفٌّ. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  يَا فَىْءَ, (M, O, K, in the CK [erroneously]<br>\
يا فَىْءُ,) or, accord. to Ks, correctly يا فَىَّ [q. v.].<br>\
(M,) [Oh! or O my wonder?] an expression of<br>\
regret, (M, O, K,) accord. to most, (TA,) or of<br>\
wonder, (Ks, M, K, TA,) meaning يَا عَجَبِى.<br>\
(Ks, M.) [See شَىْءٌ, last three sentences.]<br>\
فِئَةٌ A [party, portion, division, or distinct body,<br>\
of men, such as is termed] طَائِفَة: (S, O, K, TA:)<br>\
or a company (Msb, TA) of soldiers who fight in<br>\
the rear of an army, and to whom the latter has<br>\
recourse in the case of fear or defeat: (TA:) or<br>\
a company of men who [in war] have recourse,<br>\
for aid, one to another: (Er-Rághib, TA:) a<br>\
word having no proper sing.: (Msb, TA:) originally فِىْءٌ; (S, O, K;) the ة being substituted<br>\
for the medial ى, which is dropped: (S, O:) or<br>\
its original form is فِئْوٌ [or فِئْىٌ or فِئْوَةٌ or فِئْيِةٌ (see<br>\
art. فأو and فأى)]; the final [radical] letter being<br>\
that which is elided; for it is from فَأَوْتُ [or فَأَيْتُ]<br>\
“ I divided; ” and فِئَةٌ is syn. with فِرْقَةٌ: (IB, L,<br>\
TA:) pl. فِئَاتٌ and فِئُونَ, (S, O, Msb, K,) in<br>\
which latter the و and ن are for the making<br>\
good what is deficient [in the sing.]. (Msb.)<br>\
فَيْئَةٌ: see 1, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence] ذُو فَيْئَةٍ<br>\
a term applied to Date-stones (نَوَى التَّمْرِ) when<br>\
they are hard: [because,] being given as fodder<br>\
to cattle, and eaten by them, they pass forth as<br>\
they were at first. (T, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A time;<br>\
syn. حِينٌ. (K.) One says, جَآءَهُ بَعْدَ فَيْئَةٍ He<br>\
came to him after a time. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The<br>\
حِدَأَة [or kite], that seizes as its prey the chickens<br>\
from the dwellings: (O:) or a certain bird resembling the eagle, (L, K,) which, when it fears<br>\
the cold, migrates to El-Yemen. (L.)<br>\
فِيْئَةٌ: see 1, first quarter, in four places.<br>\
تَفِيْئَةٌ, (M and K in art. تفأ,) as also تَفِيَّةٌ, both<br>\
mentioned by Lh, and the latter reckoned as a<br>\
dial. var. of the former, (M in that art.,) and<br>\
تَئِفَّةٌ and إِفُّ and إِفَّةٌ and أَفَّةٌ and إِفَّانٌ and أَفَّانٌ,<br>\
(see art. اف,)] The time of a thing: (M and K<br>\
in art. تفأ:) one says, أَتَيْتُهُ عَلَى تَفِيئَةِ ذٰلِكَ I came<br>\
to him at the time of that: (M in that art.:) and<br>\
[by extension of the signification] one says, دَخَلَ<br>\
عَلَى تَفِئَةِ فُلَانٍ meaning أَثَرِهِ [i. e. He entered<br>\
near after such a one; as though treading in his<br>\
footsteps]: (K in the present art.:) the ت in<br>\
تَفِيْئَةٌ is an augmentative letter; the word being<br>\
[originally] of the measure تَفْعِلَةٌ, but formed by<br>\
transposition: Z says that the ت would not be<br>\
augmentative if the composition of the word were<br>\
as it is here, without transposition: that it is not<br>\
of the measure تَفْعِلَةٌ from الفَىْءُ; for, if it were,<br>\
it would be of the same measure as تَهْيِئَةٌ [i. e. it<br>\
would be تَفْيِئَةٌ]; therefore, if not formed by transposition, it would be of the measure فَعِيلَةٌ [i. e. it<br>\
would be from تفأ, as some hold it to be], because<br>\
of the إِعْلَال [or alteration for the sake of alleviating the sound, such as takes place in يَسِيرُ for<br>\
يَسْيِرُ, which cannot be in a noun of the measure<br>\
تَفْعِلَةٌ from a triliteral root like فيأ, whose medial<br>\
radical is infirm], the last radical being hemzeh:<br>\
but its formation by transposition from تَئِفَّةٌ<br>\
[originally تَأْفِفَةٌ] to تَفِّئَةٌ, which is then changed<br>\
to تَفِيْئَةٌ, as Z says in the “ Fáïk,” is what determines the ت to be augmentative, and the [original] measure to be تَفْعِلَةٌ. (L and TA * in arts.<br>\
تفأ and فيأ.)<br>\
مُفَآءٌ A thing that has been made a فَىْء [or<br>\
spoil, &amp;c.]. (TA.) And A person whose country,<br>\
or province, or town, has been conquered, and<br>\
become a فَىْء to the Muslims. (IKt, O, TA.)<br>\
It is in a trad. of some of those who have gone<br>\
before, ↓ لَا يُؤَمَّرُ مُفَآءٌ عَلَى مُفِىْءٍ, meaning An<br>\
emancipated slave shall not be made governor over<br>\
an Arabian; (K, TA;) or, as in the Nh [and O]<br>\
and L, لا يَلِيَنَّ [shall by no means rule]; (TA;)<br>\
as though it were said, none of the people of the<br>\
Sawád (which was conquered by force and became<br>\
a فَىْء to the Muslims) shall rule over the Companions (O, TA) and their next successors.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُفِىْءٌ A person who makes a thing [or a country<br>\
or the like] to be a فَىْء. (TA.) See also مُفَآءٌ.<br>\

مَفْيُؤَةٌ A place of فَىْء, i. e. of the shade thus<br>\
termed; [a place of afternoon-shade;] (M, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ مَفْيَأَةٌ; (K;) and, as AAF says, on the<br>\
authority of Th, ↓ مَفِيْئَةٌ; (M, L, TA;) and so<br>\
↓ مَفْيُوْءَةٌ, like مَسْمُوعَةٌ [in measure]: (L, TA:)<br>\
accord. to Lth, (TA,) مَفْيُؤَةٌ is syn. with مَقْنُؤَةٌ,<br>\
(S, TA,) which signifies a place on which the sun<br>\
does not come: so says Az; and he adds that it<br>\
is probably correct, but that he had not heard it<br>\
on any other authority than of Lth. (TA.)<br>\
مَفْيُوْءٌ i. q. مَعْتُوهٌ [Idiotic, or an idiot, i. e. deficient, or wanting, in intellect; &amp;c.]: so called<br>\
from his keeping long [or much] in the shade.<br>\
