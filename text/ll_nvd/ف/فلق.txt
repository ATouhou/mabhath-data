to swear by saying, وَالَّذِى فَلَقَ الحَبَّةَ وَبَرَأَ النَّسَمَةَ<br>\
[By Him who clave the grain, making it to germinate, and created, or produced, man, or the<br>\

inf. n. of فَلَقَ in the phrase فَلَقَ صُوفَ الجِلْدِ,<br>\
(TK,) signifies The plucking of the wool of the<br>\

―<br>\
-b2-  And He brought to pass that which was a<br>\

says to a man, أَعْلَقْتَ وَأَفْلَقْتَ i. e. جِئْتَ بِعُلَقَ فُلَقَ,<br>\
meaning [Thou hast brought to pass] that which<br>\
is a calamity. (S, O, K. *) ―<br>\
-b3-  And افلق فِى الأمْرِ<br>\

تَصَدَّعَتِ البَيْضَةُ وَلَمْ تَتَفَلَّقْ [The egg cracked, or<br>\
rather cracked in several places, but did not split<br>\
apart, or did not split much]. (Az, S in art. قيض.)<br>\
And of milk such as is termed رَائِب [q. v.] one<br>\
says تفلّق meaning It became dissundered, or<br>\
curdled, by reason of intense sourness: or, as<br>\
heard by Az from some of the Arabs, it, being<br>\
collected in a skin, and smitten by the heat of the<br>\
sun, became dissundered, or curdled, so that the<br>\
milk [or curds] became separate [from the whey]:<br>\

split, &amp;c., much, or in pieces, or in several or<br>\
many places]. (O, Msb.) The former occurs in<br>\
the Kur xxvi. 63, said of the sea [as meaning It<br>\
clave asunder]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] انفلق الصُّبْحُ<br>\
(S and K in art. عطس) and ↓ تفلّق (TA in the<br>\
present art.) The dawn broke. (TA in explanation<br>\
of the latter.)<br>\
8<br>\
افتلق He (a man, TA) strove, or exerted<br>\
himself, so that he excited wonder by reason of<br>\
his vehemence in running; as also ↓ تفلّق and<br>\

O,) and فِيهِ ↓ يَتَفَلَّقُ, and ↓ يَتَفَيْلَقُ, (O,) He passed<br>\

↓ فَلَقٌ (Lh, K, TA) [or فَلْقٌ?] signifies also [particularly] a fissure, or cleft, (شَقٌّ) in a mountain;<br>\
(Lh, K, TA;) and so ↓ فَالِقٌ: (K, TA:) and a<br>\
شِعْب [app. meaning gap, or ravine, or pass].<br>\
(TA.) One says, مَرَرْتُ بِحَرَّةٍ فِيهَا فُلُوقٌ, meaning<br>\
شُقُوقً [i. e. I passed by a stony tract such as is<br>\
termed حَرَّة in which were fissures, or clefts]. (S,<br>\
O.) And فِى رِجْلِهِ فُلُوقٌ i. e. شُقُوقٌ [In his foot,<br>\
or leg, are fissures or clefts]. (As, S, O, * K.)<br>\

known, (TA,) meaning مِنْ شَقِّهِ [He spoke to me<br>\

where his hair was separated, the middle of his<br>\
head. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also فَلَقٌ.<br>\
-A2-  And see the<br>\
paragraph here following, last quarter.<br>\

-b2-  Also A rod, or<br>\
branch, that is split in two, (S, O, K,) [i. e., in<br>\
halves,] and of which are then made two bows,<br>\
each whereof is termed فِلْقٌ, (S, O,) [or] each half<br>\
(كُلُّ شِقٍّ [in the CK شَقٍّ]) of what is thus split<br>\
is termed فِلْقٌ: (K, TA:) and thus is termed a<br>\
bow that is made of the half of a branch, (K,<br>\
TA,) the branch being split in two; and it is also<br>\
termed قَوْسٌ فِلْقٌ, the latter word being thus used<br>\
as an epithet, on the authority of Lh: or, as<br>\
AHn says, the bow termed فِلْقٌ is one of which<br>\
the wood whereof it has been made has been previously split in two, or three, pieces: and he also<br>\
says that ↓ فَلِيقٌ [app. for قَوْسٌ فَلِيقٌ] signifies a<br>\

two pieces. (TA.) [See also شَرِيجٌ, in two places:<br>\

last an ex. occurs in the prov.,<br>\
يَا عَجَبِى لِهٰذَهِ الفَلِيقَهٌ<br>\
هَلْ تَغْلِبَنَّ القُوَبَآءُ الرِّيقَهُ<br>\
[O my wonder at this wonderful thing! Does the<br>\
ringworm indeed overcome the spittle?]: AA says,<br>\
the meaning is, that he was in wonder at the<br>\
alteration of usual occurrences; for the spittle<br>\
usually dispels the ringworm, so he spat upon his<br>\
ringworm, but it did not become healed: القوبآء<br>\
is made an agent; and الريقة, an objective complement. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A calamity, or misfortune; (S, O, K;) as also ↓ فِلْقَةٌ, (K, TA,<br>\

a calamity: (S, O, K:) and ↓ بِعُلَقً فُلَقٍ: (O,<br>\

-b2-<br>\
Also The daybreak, or dawn; (S, O, K;) as also<br>\
↓ فَلْقٌ, mentioned by Z and others; (TA;) and<br>\
thus the former has been expl. as signifying in the<br>\
Kur cxiii. 1: (S, O, TA:) or what has broken<br>\
(انفلق) of the عَمُود of the dawn; (Fr. K, TA;)<br>\
i. e. [of the bright gleam of dawn; of the dawn<br>\
that rises and spreads, filling the horizon with its<br>\
whiteness; or] the extending light that is like the<br>\
[long tent called] عَمُود: (TA:) or [simply] the<br>\
light of daybreak or dawn: (Msb, K: *) or the<br>\
appearing of the daybreak or dawn: (Zj, TA:)<br>\
and فَلَقُ الصُّبْحِ signifies the light, and shining, or<br>\
bright shining, of the daybreak or dawn: (TA:)<br>\

Aboo-Kheyreh, or some other, of the Arabs of<br>\
the desert, to be in the midst of mountains, giving<br>\
growth to trees, a place where people alight and<br>\
where camels, or other cattle, remain during the<br>\
cold night, saying that the ↓ فَالِق is of hard, or<br>\
hard and level, ground; (TA:) and the pl. of<br>\
فَلَقٌ is فُلْقَانٌ (S, K, TA) and أَفْلَاقٌ also: (TA:)<br>\
or فَلَقٌ, (K,) or ↓ فَالِقٌ, (TA,) signifies a wide tract<br>\
of land or ground, between two extended tracts of<br>\
sand; (K, TA;) and the pl. of the latter word<br>\

-A5-  And What remains, of milk, in<br>\
the bottom of the bowl; whence one says, (in reviling a person, attributing to him meanness, TA,)<br>\

holes of the size of the shank, wherein men are<br>\
confined, (K, TA,) i. e. thieves and waylayers,<br>\
(TA,) in a row: (K, TA:) whence the saying of<br>\
Z, بَاتَ فُلَانٌ فِى الشَّفَقِ وَالفَلَقِ مِنَ الشَّفَقِ إِلَى الفَلَقِ<br>\
i. e. [Such a one passed the night] in fear and the<br>\

different copies.]) ―<br>\

K, TA) of bread, or of a [bowl such as is termed]<br>\
جَفْنَة, (TA,) or of this latter the half, (S, O, K,<br>\
TA,) as in the saying أَعْطِنِى فِلْقَةَ الجَفْنَةِ [Give<br>\
thou to me the half of the bowl, perhaps meaning,<br>\
of its contents], (S, O, TA,) or, as some say, one<br>\
of the divided halves thereof: (TA:) the pl. of<br>\
فِلْقَةٌ is فِلَقٌ: (Mgh, TA; *) and [↓ فِلَاقٌ is app. a<br>\
pl., like أَفْلَاقٌ, (and perhaps فُلُوقٌ, mentioned voce<br>\
فُلَاقٌ,) and ↓ فُلَاقٌ a quasi-pl. n., of ↓ فِلْقٌ, all<br>\
agreeably with analogy; whence] one says, صَارَ<br>\

to the ends of which are attacked the two ends of<br>\
a rope, by means whereof a man&#39;s legs are secured,<br>\
between the rope and the staff, when he is bastinaded; and it is also called ↓ فَلَقٌ: this may<br>\
perhaps be meant by its being said in the TA,<br>\
on the authority of Lh, that الفَلَقَةُ signifies<br>\
الخَشَبَةُ; as also ↓ الفَلْقَةُ].<br>\
فَلْقَى, or فَلَقَى: see فِلْقٌ, last quarter.<br>\

K:) [or فُلَاقٌ may be here a quasi-pl. n. of فِلْقٌ<br>\
(q. v. voce فِلْقَةٌ), so that the meaning may be,<br>\
that has become cleft portions of curd; and فُلُوقٌ<br>\
may also mean thus as a pl. of فِلْقٌ. See also the<br>\
next paragraph.]<br>\
فِلَاقٌ: see فِلْقَةٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The<br>\
state of milk&#39;s becoming thick and sour, so that it<br>\
curdles, or becomes dissundered: (IAar, K, TA:)<br>\
[or it may be here a pl. of فِلْقٌ (q. v. voce فِلْقَةٌ),<br>\
for in a verse cited by IAar the milk in this case<br>\
is termed ذُو فِلَاقٍ, so that it may mean the separate portions of curd of milk that has become<br>\
thick and sour; though it is said in the TA that<br>\
its pl. is فُلُوقٌ, for this I think very questionable.<br>\
See also the next preceding paragraph]<br>\
فَلُوقٌ: see فُلَاقٌ.<br>\
فَلِيقٌ: see فِلْقٌ, former half. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The depressed place in the جِرَان [or under part of the<br>\

quantity collected together, (فَلِيلَةٌ, K, TA, in the<br>\
O without any point to the first letter,) or a small<br>\

so as to produce therefrom green leaves [and of<br>\
the date-stone]: or, as some say, the Creator<br>\
thereof. (O, K. *) And hence the saying of<br>\
Áïsheh, إِنَّ البُكَآءَ فَالِقٌ كَبِدِى [Verily weeping is<br>\
cleaving my liver]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, also, in the<br>\
Kur [vi. 96], فَالِقٌ الإِصْبَاحِ He who causeth the<br>\
dawn to break: in which instance, also, فالق has<br>\
reference to the meaning of Creator: (O, TA:)<br>\

the T, بِفَالِقِ الوركآء, [thus in the TA, but I think<br>\
that الوركة and الوركآء are evidently mistran-<br>\
scriptions, and that the right reading is الوَدْكَآءِ,<br>\
with دال,] meaning [I left him in the low, or<br>\
depressed, tract in the midst of] the sand [called<br>\
El-Wedkà]. (TA.)<br>\

one says, بُلِىَ فُلَانْ بِامْرَأَةٍ فَيْلَقٍ, meaning [Such a<br>\
one was tried, or afflicted, with a woman, or wife,]<br>\
