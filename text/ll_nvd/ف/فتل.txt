the authority of some one or more of the relaters,<br>\
(O,) the fruit (بَرَمَة) of the عُرْفُط, (M, O, K,)<br>\
because its filaments, or fringe-like appertenances,<br>\
are as though they were cotton, and it is white,<br>\
like the button of the shirt, or somewhat larger:<br>\
(AHn, M, O:) or it signifies one of what are<br>\
termed ↓ فَتْلٌ, which means what are [as though<br>\
they were] twisted, of the وَرَق [properly signifying<br>\

and the like; (TA;) or, (M, K, TA,) as AHn<br>\
says, (M, TA,) this word فَتْلٌ signifies what are<br>\
not وَرَق, but are substitutes for these: (M, K,<br>\
TA:) and, (K,) as some say, (M,) what do not<br>\
expand, of [the appertenances of] plants, but are<br>\
[as though they were] twisted; (M, K;) so that<br>\
they are like هُدْب [thus in the TT as from the<br>\
M, perhaps a mistranscription for هَدَب, q. v.];<br>\
being like the هدب [i. e. هَدَب] of the طَرْفَآء and<br>\
أَثْل and أَرْطى. (M.) ―<br>\
-b7-  See also فَتِيلٌ, last sentence.<br>\

بَارِحَةٌ, meaning شَزْرَةٌ [i. e. A manner of twisting<br>\
contrary to that which is usual]. (A in art. برح.)<br>\

also ↓ مَفْتُولٌ. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A slender cord,<br>\
of [the fibres called] لِيف, (M, K,) or of [the bark<br>\

between his fingers (M, K) or between the two<br>\
fingers [meaning the thumb and fore finger], (S,<br>\
O,) of dirt [that has collected upon the skin when<br>\
it has not been recently washed]; (S, O, K;) as<br>\
also ↓ فَتِيلَةٌ. (M, K.) So says I&#39; Ab in explaining<br>\
the saying in the Kur [iv. 52, and 79 also accord.<br>\
to some readers, and xvii. 73], وَلَا يُظْلَمُونَ فَتِيلًا<br>\
[meaning (tropical:)  And they shall not be wronged by their<br>\
being deprived of the most paltry right; or they<br>\
shall not be wronged a whit]: (O, TA:) or the<br>\
[primary, or proper,] meaning in this phrase is<br>\
what here follows. (TA; and in like manner<br>\
Bd says in iv. 52.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And The سَحَاة [or integument, meaning the pellicle], (M, K, TA,) or the<br>\
خَيْط [or thread, meaning the filament], (Bd in<br>\

crease, which extends along one side] of the datestone: (M, K, TA: but for شَقّ, the CK has<br>\
شِقّ:) ISk says, the قِطْمِير is the thin integument<br>\
upon the date-stone, and, he adds, (T, TA, *) the<br>\
فَتِيل is what is in the شَقّ of the date-stone. (T,<br>\
S, O, Msb, TA.) Hence, (M,) one says, مَا أُغْنِى<br>\
عَنْهُ فَتِيلًا, (M, and so in the K except that the<br>\
latter has عَنْكَ instead of عَنْهُ,) meaning [I do not<br>\
avail, or profit, him, (or accord. to the K, thee,)<br>\
or I do not stand, or serve, him (or thee) in stead,]<br>\
as much as that سَحَاة, (M,) or a whit; (K;) and<br>\
in like manner, ↓ فَتْلَةً, (Th, M, K, [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, فَتِيلَةً,]) and ↓ فَتَلَةً. (IAar, M, K.)<br>\
فَتِيلَةٌ A wick (S, O, K) of a lamp: (T, Msb:)<br>\
pl. فَتَائِلُ and فَتِيلَاتٌ. (Msb.) [Hence, حَجَرُ<br>\
الفَتِيلَةِ Amiantus, or flexible asbestus, of which<br>\
wicks are sometimes made. ―<br>\
-b2-  And in the present<br>\
day, فَتِيلَةٌ also signifies A hempen match. ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
A suppository.] ―<br>\
-b4-  فَتَائِلُ الرُّهْبَانِ is the name of<br>\
A certain plant, the leaves of which are like [those<br>\
of] the senna (السَّنَا), and its blossom is yellow.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\

أَفْتَلُ, (S, M, O, K,) applied to the elbow, (S,<br>\
M, O,) of a camel, (S, O,) or of a she-camel,<br>\
(M,) [and app. to a he-camel,] Having what is<br>\
termed فَتَلٌ [expl. above]: (S, M, O, K:) fem.<br>\
فَتْلَآءُ, (T, M, K,) applied to a she-camel, meaning<br>\
having, in her arm, a wide separation from the<br>\
side: (T, * TA:) or, so applied, heavy, and curved<br>\
in the kind legs: (M, K:) [the pl. is فُتْلٌ:] and<br>\
one says قَوْمٌ فُتْلُ الأَيْدِى [app. meaning Persons<br>\
having the arms widely separated from the sides].<br>\
(S, O.)<br>\
ذُبَالٌ مُفَتَّلٌ [Twisted wicks]: the epithet in this<br>\
case is with teshdeed because applied to many<br>\
things. (S, O, K.)<br>\
مَفْتُولٌ: see فَتِيلٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [It also signifies (tropical:)  Compact, or firm, in make; as though twisted; like<br>\
مَجْدُولٌ and مَعْصُوبٌ:] you say رَجُلٌ مَفْتُولُ السَّاعِدِ<br>\
A man strong [or firm or compact] in the ساعد<br>\
[or fore arm]; as though it were twisted. (TA.)<br>\
