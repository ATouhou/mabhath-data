فَرَاهُ, (M, K,) aor. يَفْرِيهِ, (K,) inf. n. فَرْىٌ,<br>\
(K,) He slit it, or cut it lengthwise, ill, or improperly; or well, or properly; as also ↓ فرّاهُ and<br>\
↓ افراهُ [both relating to both of the foregoing<br>\
explanations]: (K:) or he slit it, or cut it lengthwise, and made it bad, or improper; as also ↓ فرّاهُ:<br>\
or, accord. to the sound lexicologists, the former<br>\
has this meaning: but ↓ افرى signifies he slit, or<br>\
cut lengthwise, and made good, or proper: (M:)<br>\
or ↓ افراهُ (M, K) signifies, (M,) or signifies also,<br>\
(K,) he made it good, or proper: or he ordered<br>\
[another] to make it so: (M, K:) as though he<br>\
removed from it unsoundness, or imperfection:<br>\
but some say that this signifies he slit it, or cut it<br>\
lengthwise, and made it bad, or improper: and<br>\
when you mean he measured it, and cut it, to<br>\
make it good, or proper, you say فَرَاهُ, inf. n. فَرْىٌ:<br>\
(M:) [thus, accord. to J,] فَرَى, aor. and inf. n.<br>\
as above, signifies he cut a thing in order to make<br>\
it good, or proper: (S:) or he cut a skin, or hide,<br>\
in a good, or proper, manner: (Ks, S, Msb:)<br>\
and ↓ افرى he cut it in a bad, or an improper,<br>\
manner: (Ks, S:) or this signifies he slit much,<br>\
in a bad, or an improper, manner: and افرى<br>\
الجِلْدَ, accord. to As, he rent, tore, or slit, the<br>\
skin, and made holes in it, and spoiled it: and<br>\
افرى signifies also he slit a thing (S, M, Msb) of<br>\
any kind; (as also ↓ فرّاهُ:]) thus you say,<br>\
افرى الأَودَاجَ he slit the اوداج [or external jugular<br>\
veins], (T, M, Mgh, Msb,) and made what was<br>\
in them, of the blood, to come forth; (T, Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) and in like manner one says of a garment,<br>\
or piece of cloth, and of a جُلَّة [or receptacle for<br>\
dates, made of palm-leaves woven together]; (T;)<br>\
or he cut the اوداج: (S:) IAar alone mentions<br>\
فَرَى أَوْدَاجَهُ and ↓ افراها: (M:) [but it is also said<br>\
that فَرَى signifies he cut a نِطَع [or the like]: (K<br>\
in art. خلق: [see an ex. in a verse cited in the<br>\
first paragraph of that art.; also cited in the T<br>\
after the first of the explanations here following,<br>\
and in the M after the second thereof:]) or فَرَى,<br>\
aor. and inf. n. as above, signifies he measured,<br>\
and worked, or manufactured, and made good, or<br>\
proper, a thing, such as a sandal, or a نِطَع [q. v.],<br>\
or a water-skin, and the like: (T:) or he<br>\
measured it, and cut it, to make it good, or<br>\
proper: (M:) and he measured and manufactured a مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag]: (S, K:)<br>\
or he sewed, and made well, or properly, a مزادة:<br>\
(T:) [it is said that] the difference between ↓ الإِفْرَاءُ<br>\
an الفَرْىُ is this, that the former signifies the<br>\
cutting so as to render bad, or improper, and the<br>\
slitting like as the slaughterer and the wild beast<br>\
slit [their victims]; and the latter, the cutting so<br>\
as to make good, or proper, like the act of cutting<br>\
of the sewer of the hide, or of leather: but فَرَى<br>\
sometimes occurs in the sense of افرى: (Mgh:)<br>\
one says, رَأْسَهُ ↓ أَفْرَيْتُ, meaning I split, or clave,<br>\
his head with a sword; like أَفْرَرْتُهُ: (Yz, T &amp;c.<br>\
in art. فر:) and افرى الجُرْحَ he slit the wound:<br>\
(T:) and افرى الذِّئْبُ بَطْنَ الشَّاةِ [the wolf slit, or<br>\
rent, the belly of the sheep, or goat]: (S:) and<br>\
one says, قَدْ أَفْرَيْتَ وَمَا فَرَيْتَ i. e. thou hast done<br>\
ill, or improperly, and hast not done well, or properly. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  فَرَاهُ, aor. as above, [and so<br>\
the inf. n.,] is sometimes metonymically used [as<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  He slaughtered him, or butchered him;<br>\
i. e.] as denoting vehemence, or excess, in slaying.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And it means also (assumed tropical:)  He cut him with<br>\
censure, or satire: (TA:) and ↓ افرى means he<br>\
blamed, or censured, a man. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
you say, فَرَيْتُ الأَرْضَ (tropical:)  I traversed, or crossed,<br>\
(lit. travelled and cut,) the land, or country; (T,<br>\
S, K, TA;) inf. n. as above. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  هُوَ يَفْرِى<br>\
↓ الفَرِىَّ means (assumed tropical:)  He effects what is wonderful in<br>\
his deed. (S, K.) أَحَدٌ ↓ مَا يَفْرِى فَرِيَّهُ, thus, with<br>\
teshdeed [to the ى in فريه] as related by A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
is said of a courageous man [as meaning No one<br>\
does his deed, or the like]: but it is said [by Kh]<br>\
to be correctly فَرْيَهُ, [as an inf. n.,] without tesh-deed. (M. [See, however, what follows.]) They<br>\
say, ↓ تَرَكْتُهُ يَفْرِى الفَرِىَّ, meaning [I left him]<br>\
doing well, or excellently, in a deed, or in watering:<br>\
[an explanation relating to what here follows:]<br>\
the Prophet said, respecting &#39;Omar, whom he saw<br>\
in a dream drawing water at a well with a great<br>\
bucket, ↓ فَلَمْ أَرَ عَبْقَرِيًّا يَفْرِى فَرِيَّهُ [And I have<br>\
not seen a chief of a people do his deed, &amp;c.]:<br>\
(T:) or, as some relate it, he said فَرْيَهُ: (TA:)<br>\
[but] A&#39;Obeyd says, this is like thy saying يَعْمَلُ<br>\
عَمَلَهُ and يَقُولُ قَوْلَهُ; and Fr cited to us [as<br>\
an ex.]<br>\
↓ قَدْ كُنْتِ تَفْرِينَ بِهِ الفَرِيَّا<br>\
meaning [Verily] thou didst multiply and magnify<br>\
thy words respecting it: (T: and in like manner<br>\
this hemistich [which shows, by the measure, that<br>\
الفَرِيَّا cannot be here a mistake for الفَرْيَا,] is expl.<br>\
in the S:) it is said that ↓ فَرِىّ thus used is of the<br>\
measure فَعيلٌ in the sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ,<br>\
from فَرَى signifying “ he cut ” [or “ cut lengthwise ” or “ slit ”] a hide, or leather; (Har p. 257;<br>\
[where see more;]) [and this assertion is corroborated by the fact that] one says of a man<br>\
strenuous, or vigorous, in an affair, and strong,<br>\
وَيَقُدُّ ↓ تَرَكْتُهُ يَفْرِى الفَرِىَّ [lit. I left him slitting,<br>\
or cutting, the slit, or cut, thing, and shaping].<br>\
(T.) ―<br>\
-b6-  فَرَى is also synonymous with افترى:<br>\
see the latter, in two places. ―<br>\
-b7-  فَرَى البَرْقُ, aor.<br>\
and inf. n. as above, signifies The lightning shone,<br>\
or glistened, or shone with flickering light, and continued, in the sky. (T, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  فَرِىَ, (T, S, M,<br>\
K,) aor. يَفْرَى, (T, S,) inf. n. فَرًى, (T, S, K, but<br>\
omitted in the CK,) He was, or became, confounded, or perplexed, and unable to see his right<br>\
course; syn. بَهِتَ, (T,) and دَهِشَ, (T, S, M, K,)<br>\
and تَحَيَّرَ, (S, K,) and بَطِرَ: (Skr, on the verse<br>\
here following:) El-Aalam El-Hudhalee says,<br>\
وَفَرِيتُ مِنْ فَزَعٍ فَلَا<br>\
أَرْمِى وَلَا وَدَّعْتُ صَاحِبْ<br>\
[And I became confounded, &amp;c., by reason of<br>\
fright, so that I did not shoot an arrow, nor<br>\
bade I farewell to a friend]: (T, M:) or, accord.<br>\
to As, فَرِىَ, aor. يَفْرَى, signifies he looked, and<br>\
knew not what he should do: (T:) and فَرِيتُ signifies also I wondered; from ↓ الفَرِىُّ meaning<br>\
“ that which is wonderful. ” (Skr, on the verse<br>\
above-cited.)<br>\

تفرّى It became slit, or cut lengthwise; (S,<br>\
M, Msb, K;) as also ↓ انفرى; (S, M, Msb;)<br>\
both said of a skin, (M,) or of a thing: (S:) or<br>\
it became much slit, or rent; said of the sewing<br>\
of a leathern water-skin. (T.) And تفرّى عَنْهُ<br>\
ثَوْبُهُ His garment became much slit, or rent, from<br>\
him. (T.) And تفرّت العَيْنُ (tropical:)  The spring of water<br>\
burst forth: (K, TA:) or تفرّت الأَرْضُ بِالعُيُونِ<br>\
(tropical:)  The earth, or ground, burst with the springs.<br>\
(S, M, A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] the saying of Kabeesah Ibn-Jábir,<br>\
تَفَرَّى بَيْضُهَا عَنَّا فَكُنَّا<br>\
بَنِى الأَجْلَادِ مِنْهَا وَالرِّمَالِ<br>\
i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Its eggs (the pronoun in بيضها denoting the<br>\
earth) burst from us [so as to disclose us], so that<br>\
we were the sons of the hard tracts thereof and of<br>\
the soft tracts, or plains, [or of the sands,] means<br>\
only their numerousness, and the wide extent of<br>\
their districts. (Ham p. 341.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And تفرّى اللَّيْلُ<br>\
عَنْ صُبْحِهِ (tropical:)  [The night became distinct, as though<br>\
cleft, from its dawn]. (TA.)<br>\

إِنْفَرَىَ see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
8<br>\
إِفْتَرَىَ افترىكَذِبًا He forged, or fabricated, a lie,<br>\
or falsehood; (T, S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) you<br>\
say, افترى عَلَيْهِ كَذِبًا [he forged against him a<br>\
lie]; (Mgh, Msb;) and كَذِبًا ↓ فَرَى signifies the<br>\
same, (T, S, M, Msb, K,) aor. يَفْرِى, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. فَرْىٌ; (M;) and this verb likewise is<br>\
followed by عَلَيْهِ: (Msb:) ↓ فَرَى in this sense is<br>\
mentioned as said by Lth; others saying افترى.<br>\
(T.) افترى is used in the Kur in relation also to<br>\
the attributing a copartner to God: thus in the<br>\
saying [in iv. 51], وَمَنْ يُشْرِكْ بِاللّٰهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرِىإِثمًا<br>\
عَظِيمًا [And whoso attributeth a copartner to God,<br>\
hath devised an enormous sin]. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
فَرْيَةٌ Clamour; or a confusion, or mixture, of<br>\
cries or shouts or noises. (M, K, TA. [الحَلْبَةُ in<br>\
the CK is a mistake for الجَلَبَةُ.])<br>\
فِرْيَةٌ A lie, or falsehood; (S, * M, Mgh, * Msb, *<br>\
K, TA;) a subst. from اِفْتَرَى: (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA:) and meaning [also] a defamation: (Mgh:)<br>\
pl. فِرًى. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And An affair, or a case,<br>\
of great magnitude or moment or gravity. (M,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
فرِىٌّ Slit, or cut lengthwise; applied to a skin<br>\
(جِلْدٌ): and so فَرِيَّةٌ [app. as applied to a قِرْبَة or<br>\
the like, as being fem. of فَرِىٌّ]. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
A wide دَلْو [or leathern bucket]; (M, K;) as<br>\
though it were slit; (M;) as also فَرِيَّةٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And A thing forged, or fabricated; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
thus [or rather as hence meaning unknown, or<br>\
unheard of,] in the saying, لَقَدْجِئْتِ شَيْئًا فَرِيًّا, in<br>\
the Kur [xix. 28], (S, TA,) i. e. [Thou hast done]<br>\
a thing hitherto unknown; a thing deemed strange:<br>\
(Bd:) or a thing of great magnitude or moment<br>\
or gravity; (S, K, TA;) and thus it is said to<br>\
mean in the phrase above cited: (S, TA:) or<br>\
wonderful; (T, TA;) thus as expl. by Er-Rághib; (TA;) and thus it is also said to mean<br>\
in that phrase. (T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also 1, latter<br>\
half, in eight places.<br>\
-A2-  Also, applied to a man,<br>\
A forger, or fabricator, of lies; and so ↓ مِفْرًى.<br>\
(Lh, M, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And Milk of the time when it<br>\
is milked. (K.)<br>\
-A4-  And they say, الفَرِىَّ الفَرِىَّ,<br>\
meaning العَجَلَةَ العَجَلَةَ [i. e. Haste: haste: used<br>\
in an imperative sense; as inf. ns. are often thus<br>\
used; but they are] both like غَنِىّ [in measure]:<br>\
mentioned by Sgh. (TA.)<br>\
أَفْرَى الفِرَى occurs in a trad. as meaning The<br>\
most lying of lies: الفِرَى is the pl. of فِرْيَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
مِفْرَّى: see فَرِىٌّ.<br>\
مَفْرِيَّةٌ A مَزَادَة [or leathern water-bag] made in<br>\
a good, or proper, manner; well made. (T, TA.)<br>\
