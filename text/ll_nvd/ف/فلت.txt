فَلَتٌ Escape: one says, لَيْسَ لَكَ مِنْ هٰذَا الأَمْرِ<br>\
فَلَتٌ There is no escape for thee from this affair,<br>\

فَلْتَةٌ A sudden, or an unexpected, event; or a<br>\
thing that comes upon one suddenly, or at<br>\
unawares: and anything done without consideration: (IAth, L, TA:) and an affair, or event,<br>\
that happens without its being soundly, thoroughly,<br>\
or well, performed or effected: pl. فَلَتَاتٌ: it has<br>\
no broken pl.: (M, TA:) and فَلَتَاتٌ signifies<br>\
slips, or faults, of an assembly, or a company of<br>\
men sitting together. (T, O, K, TA.) One says,<br>\
مَاتَ فَلْتَةٌ [He died suddenly]. (M.) And كَانَ<br>\

was sudden, or unexpected; (S, M, O, Msb, K,<br>\
TA;) without premeditation, (S, O, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
and without a wavering in opinion: (S, O, K,<br>\
TA:) or, as some say, it was [like] a thing hastily<br>\
and forcibly seized, or snatched: (L, TA:) and,<br>\
accord. to some, it is derived from فَلْتَةٌ in the<br>\
sense next following. (O, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The last<br>\
night of any of the sacred months, of which night<br>\
people differ as to whether it be lawful to war<br>\
therein or not, wherefore the avenger of blood<br>\
hastens to obtain retaliation. (O, TA:) or the<br>\
last night of the month; (S, M, O, K, TA;) i. e.,<br>\
of any month: (S, O, K, TA:) or the last day<br>\
of a month after which is a sacred month; (S,<br>\
M, O, K, TA;) as the last of Jumáda-l-Ákhireh;<br>\
because a man might see therein him on whom he<br>\
would take his blood-revenge, and if he delayed<br>\
to do so, and the next day arrived, the sacred<br>\
month commenced, and the opportunity escaped<br>\
him: (M, TA:) or an hour observed by the Arabs<br>\
in the Time of Ignorance; namely, the last hour<br>\
of the last day of Jumáda-l-Ákhireh: they made<br>\
hostile attacks, or incursions, during this hour,<br>\
even when the new moon of Rejeb had risen:<br>\
Rejeb not commencing until sunset: (AHeyth,<br>\
T, TA:) or لَيْلَةُ فَلْتَةٍ (or accord. to MF لَيْلَةُ<br>\
الفَلْتَةِ, TA,) the night by [the deducting of] which<br>\
the month becomes deficient, and by [the addition<br>\
of] which it becomes complete; for sometimes<br>\
some persons see the new moon when others do<br>\
not see it, and these latter make a hostile attack,<br>\
or incursion, upon the others; and it is thus<br>\
called because it is like a thing that has been let<br>\
loose after having been bound. (M, TA.)<br>\

T, S, O, K,) and sharp of spirit; (Lth, T, S, O;)<br>\

this latter sense to a horse: (K:) and ↓ فُلَتَةٌ<br>\
كُلَتَةٌ, applied to a horse, that leaps, springs, or<br>\

hard, or hardy; (T, O, K; *) applied to a man.<br>\
(T, O.) And Bold, or daring; (T, O, K;)<br>\

-A2-  Also A certain<br>\
bird, (M, K, TA,) of which they assert that it<br>\
preys upon birds, (M,) or that preys upon apes,<br>\
or monkeys, (K, TA,) said by AHát to be the<br>\
زُمَّج, (TA,) which, accord. to him, is the male<br>\
eagle: (TA in art. زمج:) it is of a colour inclining<br>\
to yellow; and sometimes it seizes the lamb, or kid,<br>\
and the young child: thus in the “ Hayát el-<br>\
Hayawán ” &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
فَلُوتٌ A garment of which the two edges cannot<br>\
be drawn together, by reason of its smallness;<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, O, K:) of which the two edges<br>\
cannot be drawn together in the hand, (M, L,)<br>\
so that they escape from the hand of the wearer<br>\
when he wraps himself in the garment: (L:)<br>\
applied as an epithet to a بُرْدَة, as also ↓ فَلْتَةٌ:<br>\
(O, L:) or فَلُوتٌ signifies a garment that does<br>\
not remain fixedly upon its wearer, by reason of<br>\
its roughness or coarseness, or its smoothness or<br>\
softness. (IAar, O.)<br>\
مُنْفَلِتٌ, for which one should not say مُفْلِتٌ, as<br>\
an epithet applied to a camel, That has got loose<br>\
