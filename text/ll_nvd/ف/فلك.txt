فلّك, (S, O, K,) inf. n. تَفْكِيكٌ, (S,) said of a<br>\
girl&#39;s breast, It became round, (S, O, K, TA,) like<br>\
the فَلْكَة [or whirl (of a spindle)], but less than is<br>\
denoted by نُهُودٌ [inf. n. of نَهَدَ, q. v.]; (TA;) as<br>\
also ↓ تفلّك, (S, O, K,) and ↓ افلك, (Th, O, K,)<br>\
and ↓ فَلَكَ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فلّكت,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. as above, (TA,) She became round<br>\
in the breast; as also ↓ فَلَكَتْ. (K, TA. [For the<br>\
latter verb, the CK has فَلِكَت.])<br>\
-A2-  See also فَلْكَةٌ,<br>\
second sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  التَّفْكِيكُ also signifies The<br>\
pastor&#39;s making, of course hair (هُلْب), a thing<br>\
like the فَلْكَة (AA, T, S, O, TA) of the spindle,<br>\
(AA, T, TA,) and inserting it into the tongue of<br>\
the young unweaned camel, (AA, T, S, O, TA,)<br>\
having perforated the tongue [for that purpose],<br>\
(AA, T, TA,) in order that he may not such:<br>\
(AA, T, S, O, TA:) accord. to Lth, فَلَّكْتُ الجَدْىَ<br>\
signifies I put a twig around the tongue of the<br>\
kid in order that it might not suck: but Az says<br>\
that the right explanation of التفكيك is that of<br>\
AA [given above]. (TA.) [See also 4 in art. جر,<br>\

فُلْكٌ A ship: (S, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.:) [also particularly applied to the ark of Noah; as in the<br>\
Kur-án vii. 62, &amp;c.:] the word is generally thus<br>\
only; but some say ↓ فُلُكٌ also, with two dammehs;<br>\
and it is held that this may be the original form;<br>\
and that فُلْكٌ may be a contraction, like as عُنْقٌ is<br>\
[of غُنُقٌ accord. to Sb]: (MF, TA:) it is masc.<br>\
and fem., (S, O, K, *) and sing. and pl., (S, O, K,)<br>\
and Ibn-&#39;Abbád says that it has فُلُوكٌ also for a<br>\
pl.: (O:) [it is said that] it may be sing., and in<br>\
this case masc.; and pl., and in this case fem.:<br>\
(IB, Msb:) [but see what here follows:] it occurs<br>\
in the Kur-án in the following (and other) places:<br>\
in xxvi. 119, &amp;c.; where it is sing. and masc.:<br>\
(S, O, TA:) and in [xvi. 14 and] xxxv. 13;<br>\
where it is pl. [and fem.]: (TA:) and in ii. 159;<br>\
where it is fem., and may be either pl. or sing.:<br>\
it seems that, when it is sing., it is regarded as<br>\
meaning the مَرْكَب, and is therefore made masc.;<br>\
or the سَفِينَة, and is therefore made fem.: (S, O,<br>\
TA:) or, (K,) as Sb used to say, (S, O, TA,) the<br>\
فُلْك that is a pl. [in meaning] is a broken pl. of<br>\
that, (S, O, K, TA,) i. e. of the فُلْك, (IB, O, K,<br>\
TA,) that is a sing. [in meaning]: and it is not<br>\
like الجُنُبُ, which is sing. and pl. [in meaning],<br>\
and the like thereof (S, O, K, TA) among substs.,<br>\
such as الطِّفْلُ &amp;c.; (S, O, TA;) for فُلْكَانِ has<br>\
been heard from the Arabs as dual of فُلْكٌ, but<br>\
not جُنُبَانِ [or the like] as dual of جُنُبٌ [or the<br>\
like]; and they say that what has not been<br>\
dualized is not a pl. [form], but [is, or may be,]<br>\
a homonym, and what has been dualized [is, or<br>\
may be,] a pl. [form]: (MF, TA:) Sb then says<br>\
in continuation, (TA,) for فُعْلٌ and فَعَلٌ share in<br>\
application to one thing [or meaning], as العُرْبُ<br>\
and العَرَبُ, (S, O, K, TA,) &amp;c.; (S, O, TA;) and<br>\
as it is allowable for فَعَلٌ to have for its pl. فُعْلٌ,<br>\
as in the instance of أَسَدٌ and أُسْدٌ, so too فُعْلٌ<br>\
may have for its pl. فُعْلٌ. (S, O, K, TA.) ↓ فُلْكِىٌّ<br>\
is a dial. var. of فُلْكٌ; and Abu-d-Dardà read,<br>\
[in the Kur x. 23,] كُنْتُمْ فِى الْفُلْكِىِّ [When<br>\
ye are in the ships; where others read فى الفُلْكِ;<br>\
and where the context shows that the pl. meaning<br>\
is intended]. (IJ, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [It may also be a pl.<br>\
of the word next following].<br>\
الفَلَكُ The place of the revolving of the stars;<br>\
(O, K, TA;) [the celestial sphere: but generally<br>\
imagined by the Arabs to be a material concave<br>\
hemisphere; so that it may be termed the vault<br>\
of heaven; or the firmament:] the astronomers<br>\
say that it is [a term applied to every one, by<br>\
itself, of] seven أَطْوَاق [by which they mean surrounding spheres], exclusive of the سَمَآء [or sky, as<br>\
meaning the region of the clouds]; wherein have<br>\
been set the seven stars [i. e. the Moon, Mercury,<br>\
Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn], in<br>\
every طَوْق [or surrounding sphere] a star, some<br>\
being higher than others; revolving therein: (TA:)<br>\
[it is also commonly imagined that above these is<br>\
an eighth sphere, called by the astronomers فَلَكُ<br>\
الثَّوَابِتِ (the sphere of the fixed stars), and by<br>\
others فَلَكُ الكُرْسِىِّ; and above this, a ninth,<br>\
called فَلَكُ الأَطْلَسِ and فَلَكُ العَرْشِ, and also<br>\
called الأَثِيرُ (q. v.):] the pl. is أَفْلَاكٌ [a pl. of<br>\
pauc.] (S, O, Msb, K, TA) and فُلُكٌ (K, TA)<br>\
and فُلْكٌ may be another pl., like as أُسْدٌ and<br>\
خُشُبٌ are pls. of أَسَدٌ and خَشَبٌ (S, O, TA.<br>\
[Thus accord. to both of my copies of the S, as well<br>\
as the O and TA: but it may be that أُسْدٌ and<br>\
خُشْبٌ are mistranscriptions for أُسُدٌ and خُشُبٌ;<br>\
and therefore that for فُلْكٌ (which is not mentioned as a pl. of فَلَكٌ in the K) we should read<br>\
فُلُكٌ.]) And فَلَكُ السَّمآءِ signifies The pole of<br>\
heaven; [generally the north celestial pole;]<br>\
likened to the pivot, or axis, of the mill-stone.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (i. e. الفَلَكُ) The revolving of the<br>\
heaven [or celestial sphere]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فَلَكٌ<br>\
signifies also The circuit, and main part, of any-<br>\
thing. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And Waves of the sea in a state<br>\
of commotion, (O, K, TA,) circling, (TA,) and<br>\
going to and fro. (O, TA.) This, (O, TA,) or<br>\
what is next mentioned, (TA,) or the place of<br>\
revolving of the stars, (O,) or the pole of heaven,<br>\
(TA,) is meant in a trad. where it is said of a<br>\
horse smitten by the [evil] eye, that he was as<br>\
though he were turning in a فَلَك. (O, TA.) And<br>\
Water put in motion by the wind, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
going to and fro, in a state of commotion: (O,<br>\
TA:) mentioned by Z. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also A hill,<br>\
or mound, of sand, having around it a wide<br>\
expanse of land: (IAar, O, K, TA:) or فَلَكٌ مِنَ<br>\
الرَّمْلِ signifies rugged, round أَجْوِبَة [app. a pl. of<br>\
جَوْبَة (though I do not find it mentioned as such),<br>\
and meaning depressed and clear places], of the<br>\
sands, like [tracts of] what are termed كَذَّان [or<br>\
soft stones resembling dry pieces of clay], hollowed<br>\
out by the gazelles. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And Pieces of land,<br>\
(S, O, K, TA,) or of sand, (S,) having a circular<br>\
form, and elevated above what is around them,<br>\
(S, O, K, TA,) with ruggedness and evenness;<br>\
(TA;) one whereof is termed ↓ فَلْكَةٌ, (S, O, K,<br>\
TA,) with the ل quiescent; pl. فِلَاكٌ; (K, TA;)<br>\
i. e. [this is pl. of فَلْكَةٌ,] like قَصْعَةٌ and قِصَاعٌ:<br>\
(TA:) in [the book entitled] El-Ghareeb ElMusannaf, [by Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee, we<br>\
find] ↓ فَلَكَةٌ and فَلَكٌ, [each] بِالتَّحْرِيك; [accord.<br>\
to which, فَلَكَةٌ is a n. un., and فَلَكٌ is a coll.<br>\
gen. n.;] but in “ the Book ” of Sb, [agreeably<br>\
with the K, we find] ↓ فَلْكَةٌ [as a sing.] and فَلَكٌ<br>\
[as a quasi-pl. n.], like حَلْقَةٌ and حَلَقٌ. (IB, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  See also فَلْكَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
فَلِكٌ A slave (AA, O) having a buttock like<br>\
the فَلْكَة [or whirl] of a spindle (AA, O, K) in<br>\
shape; (AA, O;) resembling the Zenj; (K;) [for]<br>\
the buttocks of the Zenj are round: (AA, O:) or<br>\
large in the buttocks. (TA.) And (O, K) it is<br>\
said to signify (O) Thick, or coarse of make, in<br>\
the joints: (O, K:) and loose in the bones; (K;)<br>\
or weak, loose in the bones, and flaccid; thus expl.<br>\
by Ibn-&#39;Abbád: (O:) and having a pain in his<br>\
patella (فِى فَلْكَةِ رُكْبَتِهِ). (O, K.)<br>\
فُلُكٌ: i. q. فُلْكٌ, q. v.<br>\
-A2-  And a pl. of فَلَكٌ.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
فَلْكَةٌ The whirl of a spindle: (MA:) [this is<br>\
what is meant by the saying that] the فَلْكَة of the<br>\
مِغْزَل is well known; (K;) [and] is thus called<br>\
because of its roundness: (S, O:) [it is a piece of<br>\
wood, generally of a hemispherical form, or<br>\
nearly so, through the middle of which the upper<br>\
part of the spindle-pin is inserted:] also pronounced ↓ فِلْكَة: (O, K:) the pl. [of the former]<br>\
is ↓ فَلَكٌ [or rather this is a quasi-pl. n.] and [that<br>\
of the latter sing. is] فِلَكٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A<br>\
thing that is made round, or hemispherical,<br>\
(↓ يُفَلَّكُ, or ↓ يُفْلَكُ, accord. to different copies of<br>\
the K,) like the فَلْكَة of the spindle, of coarse hair<br>\
(هُلْب), then the tongue of the young unweaned<br>\
camel is perforated, [and this thing is inserted<br>\
into it, (see 2, and see also 4 in art. لهج,)] in<br>\
order that he may be prevented from sucking. (K.<br>\
[For فتَخْرِقُ لِسانُ الفَصِيلِ in the CK, I read<br>\
فَيُخْرَقُ لِسَانُ الفَصِيلِ, as in other copies of the K<br>\
and in the TA: after these words, the copies of<br>\
the K have فَيُعْضَدُ بِهِ, app a mistranscription for<br>\
some phrase meaning فَيُجْعَلُ فِيهِ, which is necessary to complete the explanation.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And An<br>\
[eminence such as is termed] أَكَمَهٌ [formed] of<br>\
one mass of stone; (K, TA;) accord. to ISh, [of]<br>\
the smaller of the [eminences termed] إِكَام, compact in its head, as though this were the فَلْكَة of a<br>\
spindle, not giving growth to anything, in height<br>\
of the measure of two spears or a spear and a<br>\
half. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also فلَكٌ, near the end, in<br>\
two places. ―<br>\
-b5-  Also Anything circular, (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
And [particularly] The joint [or cartilaginous<br>\
disk] between the two vertebræ [i. e. between any<br>\
one of the vertebrœ and that next to it] of the<br>\
camel: (K, TA:) and the pl. [or rather quasi-pl.<br>\
n.] thereof, in this sense and in the last two of<br>\
the sense following, is ↓ فَلَكٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [And<br>\
The cap of the knee; (see فَلِكٌ;) فَلْكَةُ الرُّكْبَةِ signifying the patella: so in the present day.] ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
And The small thing (الهَنَةُ [app. the foramen<br>\
cæcum, from its round form, for, though the TA<br>\
adds the epithet النَّاشِئَةُ, which means “ rising,” I<br>\
think that this addition may be conjectural,])<br>\
upon the head of the root of the tongue. (K.) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
And The side of the [portion of the breast called<br>\
the] زَوْر [q. v.], and the part thereof that is round,<br>\
or circular. (K. [K. [But see بَلْدَةٌ: where it is said<br>\
that “ the فَلَك of the زَوْر of a horse are six in<br>\
number: ” what they are I have been unable to<br>\
determine: I incline to think that they may be<br>\
spiral curls, such as are termed دَوَائِر, pl. of<br>\
دَائِرَةٌ.])<br>\

فَلَكِىٌّ [Of, or relating to, the فَلَك as meaning<br>\

-b2-  And] One who occupies<br>\
himself [as an astronomer, or astrologer] with the<br>\
science of the stars. (TA.)<br>\
فُلَيْكَةٌ [dim. of فُلْكٌ, which is sometimes fem.<br>\
when used as a sing. as well as when used as a<br>\
pl.,] A small ship: the vulgar say فلوكة [i. e.<br>\
فَلُوكَة; whence the Italian “ feluca ”]. (TA.)<br>\
فَالِكٌ and ↓ مُفَلِّكٌ A girl whose breast is becoming<br>\
round, (K, TA,) like the فَلْكَة [or whirl (of a<br>\
spindle)]. (TA.) [And the former is also applied<br>\
as an epithet to the breast: for] AA says that<br>\
[the pl.] فَوَالِكُ is applied to breasts (ثُدِىّ) that<br>\
are less than such as are termed نَوَاهِدُ. (TA.)<br>\
فَيْلَكُونٌ The شُوبَق [or baker&#39;s rolling-pin: see<br>\
the latter word]: (O, K, TA: [in the CK, السَّوِيقُ<br>\
is erroneously put for الشُّوبَقُ:]) Az holds both of<br>\
