-b2-  فاح الدَّمُ, inf. n. فَيْحٌ (L, Msb) and<br>\
فَيَحَانٌ, (L,) It poured out, or forth: (L:) or it<br>\
flowed; as also ↓ افاح, inf. n. إِفَاحَةٌ: or, accord.<br>\
to AZ, the latter is trans., and signifies as expl.<br>\
below in relation to blood. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And فَاحَتِ<br>\
الشَّجَّةُ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor. تَفِيحُ, inf. n. فَيْحٌ,<br>\
(TA,) (tropical:)  The wound upon the head spirted forth<br>\

and aor. يَفوحُ, inf. n. فَوْحٌ; (assumed tropical:)  The heat rose, or<br>\
diffused itself, and raged vehemently. (L.) It is<br>\
said in a trad., شِدَّةُ القَيْظِ مِنْ فَيْحِ جَهَنَّمَ (tropical:)  [The<br>\
intenseness of the heat of summer is from the<br>\
vehement raging of the heat of Hell]. (TA.)<br>\
And one says, الحُمَّى مِنْ فَيْحِ جَهَنَّمَ (tropical:)  The fever<br>\
is from the vehemence of the heat of Hell. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\

and تَفُوحُ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  The cooking-pot boiled; (S,<br>\

its heat. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And فَاحَتِ النَّارُ (assumed tropical:)  The fire<br>\
spread. (Msb.) And [hence, app.,] فَاحَتِ الغَارَةُ,<br>\
aor. تَفِيحُ, i. e. (tropical:)  [The troop of horsemen making an<br>\
attack, or incursion, upon a people] spread themselves. (S, TA.) See فَيَاحِ. ―<br>\
-b7-  And فاح, (L, Msb,<br>\
TA,) aor. يَفَاحُ, (L, TA,) [inf. n., app. فَيَحٌ, which<br>\
signifies “ width ” accord. to the S and K, and is<br>\
agreeable with general analogy in this case, as<br>\
the aor. of the verb is originally يَفْيَحُ, though it<br>\
seems to be implied in the Msb that the aor. is<br>\
not يَفَاحُ, but يَفِيحُ,] It (a sea, S, * L, K, * TA,<br>\
and a place, L, or a valley, Msb) was, or became,<br>\

ى. (M.)<br>\
فَيْحٌ and ↓ فُيُوحٌ Abundance of herbage of the<br>\
[rain, or season, called] رَبِيع, with ample extent<br>\
of land: (K:) [accord. to the TK, both are inf.<br>\
ns., of which the verb is فَاحَ, and the agent is<br>\
الرَّبِيعُ: but this, I think, is rendered doubtful by<br>\
what here follows:] فيوح occurs in a verse [as<br>\
some relate it]; but accord. to the relation of<br>\
IAar, it is فَتُوح, with ت, [and with fet-h to the<br>\
ف,] and this, which signifies “ rain,” is said by<br>\

(L,) means Spread out, O attacking troop of<br>\
horsemen: (S, A, K:) or spread out upon them,<br>\
or against them, and disperse yourselves, &amp;c. (Sh,<br>\
L.)<br>\
فُيُوحٌ: see فَيْحٌ.<br>\
فَيَّاحٌ: see أَفْيَحُ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (tropical:)  Profuse in bounty: (S, A:) so in the saying, إِنَّهُ<br>\
لَجَوَادٌ فِيَّاحٌ (tropical:)  [Verily he is liberal, munificent, or<br>\
generous; profuse in bounty]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And نَاقَةٌ<br>\
فَيَّاحَةٌ (tropical:)  A she-camel that yields much milk, (A,<br>\

to others, it is ↓ فَيَاحٌ, without teshdeed: (L:)<br>\
[the fem. of أَفْيَحُ: and pl. فِيحٌ:] one says دَارٌ فِيْحَآءُ<br>\
A wide, or an ample, house or abode: (S, K:)<br>\
and in like manner رَوْضَةٌ [a meadow, &amp;c.]. (L,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And فَيْحَآءُ signifies also A sort of thin<br>\
cooked food, such as is supped, or sipped, (حَسَآءُ,)<br>\
seasoned with seeds such as are used in cookery.<br>\
