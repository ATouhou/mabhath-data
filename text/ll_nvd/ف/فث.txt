فَثَّ جُلَّتَهُ, (T, O, K,) [aor.<br>\
فَثُ3َ,] inf. n. فَثٌّ,<br>\
(T,) He scattered the dates of his جُلَّة [or receptacle made of palm-leaves]. (T, O, * K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
فَثَّ المَآءَ الحَارَّ بِالبَارِدِ, aor.<br>\
فَثُ3َ, (M, TA,) inf. n. فَثٌّ,<br>\
(TA,) He abated, or allayed, the heat of the hot<br>\
water by means of the cold: from Yaakoob. (M,<br>\
TA.) [See also فَثَأَ.]<br>\
7<br>\
انفثّ, inf. n. اِنْفِثَاثٌ, i. q. اِنْكَسَرَ [accord. to<br>\
the TK used in its proper sense as signifying It<br>\
broke, or became broken: but for this I find no<br>\
authority]. (T, O, K.) So in the saying, انفثّ<br>\
الرَّجُلُ مِنْ هَمٍّ أَصَابَهُ [The man became broken in<br>\
spirit, or languid, from anxiety, or solicitude, that<br>\
befell him]. (T, O.)<br>\
8<br>\
مَا افْتُثَّ بَنُو فُلَانٍ قَطُّ means The sons of such<br>\
a one have not been overcome, or subdued, hitherto,<br>\
or ever. (AA, O, K. *)<br>\
فَثٌّ A certain plant, the grain of which is made<br>\
into bread, (S, M, O, K,) and eaten, (S, M, O,)<br>\
in the time of drought, or dearth: (S, M, O, K:)<br>\
in some of the copies of the K, يُخْتَبَأُ is put for<br>\
يُخْتَبَزُ: (M, F:) the bread made of it is coarse,<br>\
or thick, resembling the bread that is baked in hot<br>\
ashes [which is generally made in the form of<br>\
thick round cakes]: (S, O:) a grain resembling<br>\
[the species of millet called] جَاوَرْس, which is made<br>\
into bread, and eaten: (IAar, T:) it is a wild<br>\
grain, which the Arabs of the desert take, in the<br>\
times of hunger, and pound, or bruise, and make<br>\
into bread; and it is a bad kind of food, but<br>\
sometimes, or often, they are content with it for<br>\
days: (T:) or, as some say, it is [a plant] of the<br>\
species called نَجِيل, growing in salt lands, of the<br>\
[plants termed] حُمُوض [pl. of حَمْض], of which<br>\
bread is made: [a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. فَثَّةٌ: (Th,<br>\
M:) Aboo-Ziyád El-Kilábee says, the فَثّ, like<br>\
the دُعَاع, is a herb (بَقْلَة) in which comes forth<br>\
grain, and each of them spreads [upon the ground],<br>\
not growing up high; and when they become dry,<br>\
the people collect what is dry thereof, then pound,<br>\
or bruise, it, and winnow it, and take forth from<br>\
it a sort of black grain, with which they fill sacks,<br>\
and lade the camels: it is a black sort of grain<br>\
like the شَهْنِيز [q. v.], and they make bread of it,<br>\
and make عَصِيدَة (يَعْتَصِدُونَ): (O:) in the Bári&#39;<br>\
it is said to be a species of tree or plant (شَجَرٌ)<br>\
growing in the plain, or soft, lands, and on the<br>\
[eminences called] آكَام, having a sort of grain<br>\
like the حِمَّص [or chick-peas], of which are made<br>\
bread and سَوِيق. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And accord. to<br>\
IF, الفَثُّ signifies The هَبِيد, (O, Msb,) meaning<br>\
the pulp of the colocynth, شَحْمُ الحَنْظَلِ, (O,) or<br>\
the colocynth-plant, شَجَرُ الحَنْظَلِ. (Msb: and<br>\
this is one of the meanings assigned to الفَثُّ in<br>\
the K. [In the TK, شَحْمُ الحَنْظَلِ is said to be<br>\
the correct explanation: but from what will be<br>\
seen voce هَبِيدٌ, I think it most probable that the<br>\
right meaning is The seeds of the colocynth.]) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
IF also says that it signifies The فَسِيل [i. e. shoot,<br>\
or shoots, of the palm-tree,] which is, or are,<br>\
plucked forth [entire,] from the base thereof. (O.)<br>\
-A2-  تَمْرٌ فَثٌّ Dates that are scattered; (Lth, Kr,<br>\
M, K;) not in a provision-bag or other receptacle;<br>\
like بَثٌّ: (Kr, M:) or dates that are separate,<br>\
each one from others; not sticking together; (T,<br>\
O;) and so فَذٌّ and بَذٌّ and فَضٌّ. (T.)<br>\
مَفَثَّةٌ Multitude: (T, O, K:) so in the saying,<br>\
وُجِدَ لِبَنِى فُلَانٍ مَفَثَّةٌ [Multitude was found to be<br>\
attributable to the sons of such a one] when they<br>\
were numbered: (T, O:) and مَقَثَّةٌ signifies the<br>\
same. (K and TA in art. قث.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [i. q.<br>\
نُزُلٌ:] one says, مَا رَأَيْنَا جُلَّةً أَكْثَرَ مَفَثَّةً مِنْهَا, meaning نُزُلًا [i. e. We have not seen a receptacle made<br>\
of palm-leaves, for dates, having more food prepared for the guest than it]: (T, O:) and كَثِيرُ<br>\
مَفَثَّةٍ means كَثِيرُ نُزُلٍ [i. e. Abundant in respect<br>\
of food prepared for the guest]. (So in some<br>\
copies of the K: in other copies نَزَلٍ. [The TA<br>\
gives the latter reading; and so, therefore, does<br>\
the TK, which explains it as meaning “ increase,”<br>\
and adds that one says طعام كثير مفثة, an ex.<br>\
app. without any authority; for what I have<br>\
cited from the T and O shows, I think, that the<br>\
former reading, and not the latter, is unquestionably right.])<br>\
