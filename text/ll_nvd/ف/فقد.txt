فَقَدَهُ, (S, A, MA, Mgh, O, L, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
فَقِدَ,<br>\
(S, A, O, &amp;c.,) inf. n. فَقْدٌ and فِقْدَانٌ (S, MA,<br>\
O, L, Msb, K) and فُقْدَانٌ (S, O, F) and فُقُودٌ;<br>\
(IDrd, O, L, K;) and ↓ افتقدهُ; (S, A, MA,<br>\
Mgh, O;) He found it not, (L, TA,) lost it,<br>\
(MA, PS, &amp;c.,) saw it not, (JK in explanation<br>\
of the latter verb,) [missed, or failed of finding<br>\
or seeing, it,] it was, or became, absent from him,<br>\
(Mgh,) or he had it not, was destitute of it, was<br>\
without it, lacked it, or wanted it, syn. عَدِمَهُ;<br>\
(Msb, L, K;) but accord. to Er-Rághib, الفَقْدُ<br>\
has a more special signification than العَدَمُ, this<br>\
latter being the contr. of الوُجُودُ; (TA;) [whereas]<br>\
الفَقْدُ [as inf. n. of فُقِدَ, though often used as<br>\
meaning the being non-existent, properly] signifies<br>\
the thing&#39;s being absent from the range of perception by sense so that its place is not known. (Bd<br>\
in xii. 71.) [فُقِدَ signifies It was not found, was<br>\
lost, was not seen, &amp;c.] It is related of Abu-dDardà that he said, يَفْقِدْ ↓ مَنْ يَتَفَقَّدْ, [lit. He<br>\
who seeks will not find,] meaning he who seeks after<br>\
good in mankind will not find it; for he saw good<br>\
to be rare in mankind: or he who seeks to acquaint<br>\
himself with the circumstances of men will not<br>\
find what will please him. (L.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَفْقَدَهُ اللّٰهُ إِيَّاهُ God caused him to lose, or fail<br>\
of finding, him, or it. (L, K.) One says, أَفْقَدَكَ<br>\
اللّٰهُ كُلَّ جَمِيمٍ [May God cause thee to lose every<br>\
relation, or loved and loving relation]. (A.) [Or]<br>\
الإِفْقَادُ is not of established authority: as to the<br>\
saying الجُنُونُ يُفْقِدُ شَهْوَةَ الجِمَاعِ [meaning Insanity causes to lose, or annuls, the desire of coïtus],<br>\
the correct word is يُعْدِمُ or يُزِيلُ. (Mgh.)<br>\
5<br>\
تفقّدهُ He sought it, or sought for it or after<br>\
it; or did so leisurely or repeatedly; (A, * Mgh,<br>\
L;) as also ↓ افتقدهُ: (Mgh, L:) or he sought it,<br>\
or sought for it or after it, it being absent from<br>\
him; (S, O, L, Msb, K;) as also ↓ افتقدهُ: (K:)<br>\
or he sought, or sought leisurely or repeatedly, to<br>\
obtain knowledge of it, having lost it: so accord.<br>\
to Er-Rághib and many others; but this expression and تعَهَّدَهُ are used, by some, each in the<br>\
place of the other, and the latter, accord. to Er-Rághib and many others, [properly] signifies he<br>\
sought, or sought leisurely or repeatedly, to obtain<br>\
knowledge of it, having known it before. (MF.)<br>\
You say, ↓ مَا تَفَقَّدْتُهُ مُنْذُ افْتَقَدْتُهُ, meaning منذ<br>\
فَقَدْتُهُ [i. e. I have not sought for, or after, him,<br>\
or it, since I lost him, or it. (B, TA.) See also<br>\
1, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also He investigated it.]<br>\
6<br>\
تفاقدوا means فَقَدَ بَعْضُهُمْ بَعْضًا [i. e. They<br>\
lost one another]. (S, O, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِفْتَقَدَ see 1: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also 5, in three places.<br>\
الفَقْدُ, (O, K,) by Az, (K,) or in a number of<br>\
the copies of the work of Az, (O,) erroneously<br>\
written الفَقَدُ, (O, K,) A certain plant, (K,) resembling the [species of cuscuta, or dodder, called]<br>\
كَشُوث: (TA:) and a beverage prepared from<br>\
raisins or honey or [the plant] كشوث, as also<br>\
↓ الفُقْدُدُ: (K:) or, as AHn says, a certain plant<br>\
which is thrown into the beverage of honey, which<br>\
beverage consequently becomes strong, and is then<br>\
called الفَقْدُ: he says, the فَقْد is what is called in<br>\
Pers. فَنْجَنْكُشْت: IAar says, ↓ الفِقْدَةُ [or الفَقْدَةُكشوث ?<br>\
then. un.] is the كشوث: and a beverage prepared<br>\
from raisins and honey; and it is said that a<br>\
beverage (نَبِيذ) is made of honey, and then the<br>\
فَقْد is thrown into it, and causes it to become<br>\
strong: so says Lth: and he says that the فَقْد is<br>\
a plant resembling the كشوث: and ↓ الفُقْدُدُ is<br>\
the نَبِيذ of the كشوث. (O.)<br>\
الفَِقْدَةُ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
الفُقْدُدُ: see الفَقْدُ, in two places.<br>\
فَقِيدٌ and ↓ مَفْقُودٌ signify the same, (O, Msb,<br>\
K,) [Not found, lost, not seen, missed, non-existent,]<br>\
absent from one, (Mgh in explanation of the latter,)<br>\
not had, lacking or lacked, wanting or wanted.<br>\
(Msb, K.) One says, مَاتَ غَيْرَ فَقِيدٍ وَلَا حَمِيدٍ,<br>\
(A, K,) and وَلَا مَحْمُودٍ ↓ غَيْرَ مَفْقُودٍ, (A,) [He<br>\
died unmissed and unpraised; or,] without his<br>\
loss being cared for [and without being praised].<br>\
(A, K.)<br>\
فَاقِدٌ [as act. part. n. of 1 signifies Not finding<br>\
a thing, losing it, not seeing it, missing it, not<br>\
having it, being destitute of it, lacking it, or wanting it; or having failed to find it, having lost it,<br>\
or having failed to see it. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] A<br>\
woman who is bereft of her child [by death]:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd:) or who loses (تَفْقِدُ) her husband or<br>\
child: (S, O:) or whose husband, or child, (L,<br>\
K, TA,) or relation, or loved and loving relation,<br>\
(TA,) has died: (L, K, TA:) or who marries<br>\
after the death of her husband. (Lth, L, K.) The<br>\
Arabs say, لَا تَتَزَوَّجَنَّ فَاقِدًا وَتَزَوَّجْ مُطَلَّقَةً [Do<br>\
not thou marry a woman whose husband has died,<br>\
but [rather] marry thou a divorced woman]. (Lh,<br>\
L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And in like manner, (O,) it is applied<br>\
also to a she-gazelle, (S, O, L,) and to a cow<br>\
[app. a wild cow], (O, L, K,) as also فَاقِدَةٌ, (O,)<br>\
meaning Whose young one has been devoured by a<br>\
beast, or bird, of prey; (O, L, K;) and to a<br>\
pigeon (حَمَامَة) likewise. (L.)<br>\
