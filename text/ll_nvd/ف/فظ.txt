فَظَّ, (Msb,) sec. pers. فَظِظْتَ, (S, M, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. فَظَاظَةٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and فَظَظٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
but the former is the more common because of the<br>\
difficulty of pronouncing the doubled letter in the<br>\
latter, (M,) and ↓ فِظَاظٌ is syn. with these, (M, K,)<br>\
and so is ↓ فَظَاظٌ, but these two are simple substs.,<br>\
(M,) He (a man) was, or became, such as is<br>\
termed فَظٌّ [i. e. rough, coarse, rude, &amp;c., as expl.<br>\
below]; (S, M, Msb, K; *) or rough, &amp;c., so as<br>\
to be unduly feared. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  فَظَّةُ, (M, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
فَظُ3َ, inf. n. فَظٌّ; (TK;) and ↓ افتظّهُ; (M, K;)<br>\
He let it out, namely the water termed فَظٌّ, by<br>\
cutting open the stomach [of a camel]: (M, TA:)<br>\
or he pressed it, or squeezed it, out, namely the<br>\
water so termed, (M, K,) from the stomach, (M,<br>\
TA,) and drank it: (TK:) and كَرِشَ بَعِيرٍ ↓ افتظّ<br>\
he slaughtered a camel, and pressed out, or squeezed<br>\
out, the water of its stomach, and strained it:<br>\
(Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, T:) or ↓ افتظّ signifies he gave his<br>\
camel to drink, then bound his mouth in order that<br>\
he might not ruminate, and, when attacked by<br>\
thirst, cut open his belly, and pressed out, or<br>\
squeezed out, the fluid of the feces of his stomach,<br>\
and drank it: (S:) and الكَرِشَ ↓ أَفْظَظْتُ I pressed<br>\
out, or squeezed out, the water of the stomach.<br>\
(Z, TA.)<br>\

أَفْظَ3َ see فَظَّهُ. ―<br>\
-b2-  افظّهُ, inf. n. إِفْظَاظٌ, also signifies He turned him back, or away, from the object<br>\
of his desire. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And افظّهُ is also said of<br>\
a man when he has inserted the thread into the<br>\
eye of the needle: [if the affixed pronoun refer<br>\
to the eye of the needle, the meaning is, He inserted the thread into it: if to the thread, he<br>\
inserted it into the eye of the needle:] mentioned<br>\
by AA. (TA.)<br>\

إِفْتَظَ3َ see فَظَّهُ, in three places.<br>\
فَظٌّ, applied to a man, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) Rough;<br>\
coarse; rude; unkind; hard; churlish; uncivil;<br>\
surly; hard to deal with; incompliant; unobsequious; (S, M, O, K, and Bd in iii. 153;) evil<br>\
in disposition; illnatured; (O, K, and Bd and<br>\
Jel ubi suprà;) hard-hearted; hard, or severe;<br>\
rough, coarse, or the like, so as to be unduly<br>\
feared; (Msb;) rough, or coarse, in speech; (Lth,<br>\
T, M, K;) sour, or austere, therein: (Lth:) [said<br>\
in the T to be from the same word in the sense<br>\
next following; but accord. to the M, the reverse<br>\
seems to be the case:] pl. أَفْظَاظٌ. (M.) You say,<br>\
إِنَّهُ لَفَظٌّ بَظٌّ [Verily he is rough, coarse, or the like];<br>\
the latter word being an imitative sequent; (M,<br>\
K;) as such we regard it because Th, who mentions it, does not explan it; (M;) and ↓ فَظِيظٌ<br>\
بَظِيظٌ [app. signifies the same]. (TA in art. بظ.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The water of the stomach [of a camel],<br>\
(T, S, K,) which is pressed, or squeezed, out, and<br>\
drunk, (T, K,) on an occasion of want of water,<br>\
(T,) in the waterless deserts; (T, K;) the water<br>\
that comes forth from the stomach [of a camel];<br>\
because it is a coarse, or bitter, beverage: (M:)<br>\
it may not be used for the purpose of religious<br>\
purification: (Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee, T:) also, the urine of<br>\
horses which is drunk on an occasion of thirst: pl.<br>\
فُظُوظٌ: thus used by Mutemmem Ibn-Nuweyreh.<br>\
(M, L.)<br>\
فَظَاظٌ and فِظَاظٌ: see 1, first sentence.<br>\
فَظِيظٌ The seminal fluid of a woman: or of a<br>\
stallion: (M, K:) so they assert: but it is not<br>\
of established authority: (M:) and so say IDrd<br>\
and Fr: (TA:) accord. to Kr, the seminal fluid<br>\
of a stallion, in a she-camel&#39;s womb: (M, * TA:)<br>\
or this is the explanation given by Fr: (T:) and<br>\
↓ فُظَاظَةٌ is of the measure فُعَالَةٌ from this word;<br>\
(K;) as signifying the seminal fluid of a stallion,<br>\
or the water of the stomach; but El-Khattábee<br>\
disallows the latter meaning; or from فَظٌّ: (TA:)<br>\
and hence the saying of &#39;Áïsheh to Marwán, وَلٰكِنَّ<br>\
اللّٰهَ لَعَنَ أَبَاكَ وَأَنْتَ فِى صُلْبِهِ فَأَنْتَ فُظَاظَةٌ مِنْ لَعْنَةِ<br>\
اللّٰهِ [But God cursed thy father when thou wast<br>\
essentially in his loins; so thou art seed of the<br>\
object of the curse of God]; (K;) i. e., نُطْفَةٌ مِنْهَا;<br>\
(TA;) or عُصَارَةٌ مِنْهَا [produce thereof, as though<br>\
expressed therefrom]: (Z:) or, accord. to one<br>\
relation, فُضُضٌ; (K;) pl. of فَضِيضٌ, which means<br>\
water such as is termed غَرِيض: or, accord. to<br>\
another relation, فَضَضٌ, meaning نُطْفَةٌ: and<br>\
accord. to another, فَضِيضٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
فَظٌّ.<br>\
فُظَاظَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
هُوَ أَفْظُّ مِنْ فُلَانٍ He is [more rough, coarse,<br>\
rude, or the like, (see فَظٌّ,) or] more difficult in<br>\
disposition, evil in disposition, illnatured, or perverse, than such a one. (TA.)<br>\
