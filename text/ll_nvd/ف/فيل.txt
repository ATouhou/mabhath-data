فَالَ رَأْيُهُ, aor. يَفِيلُ, (S, M, O, K,) inf. n.<br>\
فُيُولَةٌ, (S,) thus in some copies of the K and in<br>\
the A, (TA,) or فَيْلُولَةٌ, (M, O,) thus in other<br>\
copies of the K, (TA,) and فَيَالَةٌ, thus in the O,<br>\
but in the copies of the K فَيْلَة, (TA,) His judgment, or opinion, was weak, (S, M, O, K,) and<br>\
erroneous; (M, K;) as also ↓ تفيّل; (M, Z, K,<br>\
TA;) and [in like manner] فِى رَأْيِهِ ↓ فَيَّلَ [not فُيِّلَ]<br>\
he was incorrect in his judgment, or opinion; and<br>\
↓ فَيَّلُوا occurs in a trad. as meaning فال رَأْيُهُمْ:<br>\
(TA:) [and فَالَ alone, said of a man, signifies<br>\
the same as فال رَأْيُهُ, as is shown by a verse of<br>\
El-Kumeyt cited in the T and M and O and TA:<br>\
but it seems from what here follows (taken from<br>\
a passage unconnected with the foregoing) that<br>\
the first and third of what are mentioned above<br>\
as inf. ns. are regarded by some as simple substs.:]<br>\
and one says, ↓ فِى رَأْيِهِ فَيَالَةٌ, (T, M, K, TA,)<br>\
the last word like سَحَابَةٌ, (TA, [in the CK, erroneously, فى رِوَايَةٍ فِيَالَةٌ,]) and ↓ فُيُولَةٌ, (M, K, TA,)<br>\
meaning [In his judgment, or opinion, is] a weakness. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And فال signifies also He (a<br>\
man) magnified himself, and became like the elephant (الفِيل); or he showed a morose aspect:<br>\
(TA:) [or it may so signify: IAar cites the<br>\
following verse:<br>\
مِنَ النَّاسِ أَقْوَامٌ إِذَا صَادَفُوا الغِنَى<br>\
تَوَلَّوْا وَفَالُوا لِلصَّدِيقِ وَفَخَّمُوا<br>\
which may mean [Of mankind are folks who,<br>\
when they find riches, turn the back, and] magnify<br>\
themselves and become like the elephant [to the<br>\
friend, and aggrandize themselves] or show a<br>\
morose aspect to the friend [&amp;c.]; for the elephant is morose in aspect. (M.)<br>\
2<br>\
فيّل رَأْيَهُ, (S, M, K,) inf. n. تَفْيِيلٌ, He<br>\
declared [or esteemed] his judgment, or opinion,<br>\
to be weak, (S.) or bad, and erroneous. (M, K.)<br>\
Umeiyeh Ibn Abee-&#39;Áïdh says,<br>\
فَلَوْ غَيْرَهَا مِنْ وُلْدِ كَعْبِ بْنِ كَاهِلٍ<br>\
مَدَحْتَ بِقَوْلٍ صَادِقٍ لَمْ تُفَيَّلِ<br>\
meaning لَمْ يُفَيَّلْ رَأْيُكَ (SKr, M) i. e. [But hadst<br>\
thou praised other than her, of the children of<br>\
Kaab Ibn-Káhil, with a true saying,] thy judgment, or opinion, would not have been declared<br>\
weak. (SKr.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, in two places.<br>\
3<br>\
فَايَلَ, [inf. n. مُفَايَلَةٌ and فِيَالٌ, (see الفَيَالُ<br>\
below,)] He played [at the game called الفَيَال:<br>\
see its part. n. below]. (O.)<br>\
5<br>\
تفيّل: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  Also He (a man, K, [or a<br>\
camel, as is indicated in the O,]) became fat, (O,<br>\
K,) as though he were a فِيل [or an elephant].<br>\
(O.) [See also 10.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And, said of youth, or<br>\
young manhood, (الشَّبَاب,) It increased, (Lth, T,<br>\
M, O, K,) and became in its prime and fulness.<br>\
(Lth, T, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, said of herbage, It became<br>\
tall, and full-grown; or became of its full height,<br>\
and blossomed. (Th, M, K.)<br>\
10<br>\
اِسْتَفْيَلَ He (a camel) became like the فِيل<br>\
[or elephant] (M, K, TA) in bigness: (TA:)<br>\
mentioned by IJ among the class of اسْتَحْوَذَ and<br>\
the like: part. n. مُسْتَفْيِلٌ. (M.) [See also 5.]<br>\
فَالٌ: see فِيلٌ, latter half:<br>\
-A2-  and the paragraph<br>\
commencing with فَائِلُ الرَّأْىِ, near its end:<br>\
-A3-<br>\
and see also فَأْلٌ, in art. فأل.<br>\
فَيْلٌ: see the paragraph here following.<br>\
فِيلُ [The elephant; Pers. پيل;] a certain<br>\
animal, (TA,) well known: pl. [of pauc.] أَفْيَالٌ<br>\
and [of mult.] فُيُولٌ and فِيَلَةٌ; (S, M, O, Msb,<br>\
K;) not أَفْيِلَةٌ: (ISk, S, O, Msb:) accord. to Sb.<br>\
فِيلٌ may be originally of the measure فُعْلٌ, (S,<br>\
M, O,) pronounced with kesr because of the ى,<br>\
like as they said أَبْيَضُ and بيضٌ; but Akh says,<br>\
this is not the case in the sing, but only in the<br>\
pl.: (S, O:) fem. with ة. (M, K) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
لَيْلَةٌ مِثْلُ لَوْنِ الفِيلِ [lit. A night like the colour of<br>\
the elephant;] meaning a night that is black. (M,<br>\
TA,) and dust-coloured; (M;) in which one<br>\
knows not the right course to pursue: the colours<br>\
of the فيل being of this kind. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence, also, دَآءُ الفِيلِ The disease called by us<br>\
the tumid Barbadoes leg; because the leg of the<br>\
patient resembles that of the elephant by reason<br>\
of its enormously-swollen state: not (as some<br>\
have supposed it to be) elephantiasis; this latter<br>\
being termed جُذَام (q. v.) [―<br>\
-b4-  And hence, likewise, used as an epithet,] فِيلٌ signifies also<br>\
(tropical:)  Heavy [or dull]; and low, ignoble, or mean.<br>\
(K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And one says رَجُلٌ فِيلُ الرَّأْىِ,<br>\
meaning A man weak in respect of judgment, or<br>\
opinion; (T, S, M, O, K;) and so ↓ فِيْلُهُ; (M,<br>\
K;) and ↓ فَائِلُهُ: (T, M, O, K;) and ↓ فَيِّلُهُ,<br>\
(ISk, T, S, M, O, K,) of the measure فَيْعِل; (O:)<br>\
and ↓ فَالُهُ, (T, M, O, K,) and فَالٌ alone. (S, K.)<br>\
meaning weak in respect of judgment, or opinion;<br>\
(T, S, M, O, K;) erring in insight: (S:) pl. of<br>\
the first] أَفْيَالٌ: (S, M, O, K:) but AO says, the<br>\
↓ فَائِل is one who, inspecting, forms an opinion and<br>\
errs; if he err after examining a horse in all its<br>\
states or conditions and forming an opinion respecting it from his inspection, [not while doing<br>\
so,] he is not reckoned to be فائل. (TA.)<br>\
الفَيَالُ and الفِيَالُ, (Lth, T, M, O, K) the<br>\
former a subst, and the latter an inf. n. [of 3],<br>\
(Lth, T, O,) and ↓ المُفَايَلَةُ [which is likewise an<br>\
inf. n. of 3], (M, K,) A certain game, (Lth, T,<br>\
M, O, K,) well known, (O,) of the children, (T,)<br>\
or of the youths, or young men, of the Arabs (M,<br>\
K) of the desert, (M,) with earth, or dust: (Lth,<br>\
T, M, O:) a thing is hidden in earth, or dust,<br>\
which is then divided (T, M) into two portions;<br>\
then the hider says to his companion, In which of<br>\
them twain is it? (T;) and if he [who is thus<br>\
questioned] mistake, the hider says to him فَالَ<br>\
رَأْيُكَ: (T, M, * K; *) ISk termed it الفِئَالُ, with ء;<br>\
(O;) and it has been mentioned before in art.<br>\
فأل: (T, O, K:) accord. to some, (TA,) this<br>\
game is called الطَّبَنُ and السُدَّرُ. (T, TA. [But<br>\
see the former of these two words.])<br>\
فَيَالَةٌ: see the first paragraph.<br>\
فُيُولَةٌ: see the first paragraph.<br>\
فَيِّلُ اللَّحْمِ A man having much flesh: (T, O, *<br>\
K:) some pronounce it with ء, (T, O,) saying<br>\
فَيأَل, (T,) or فَئِل; (O;) both mentioned before<br>\
[in art. فأل]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  فَيِّلُ الرَّأْىِ: see فِيلٌ,<br>\
latter half.<br>\
فَيِّالٌ The attendant, or master, (S, M, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) or the keeper, or driver, (MA, KL,) of the<br>\
فِيل [or elephant], (S, MA, O, Msb, KL,) or of<br>\
the فِيلَة. (So in the M and K.)<br>\
فَائِلُ الرَّأْىِ: see فِيلٌ, latter half, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  الفَائِلُ [as a subst.] signifies The flesh that is<br>\
upon the خُرْبَة, (S, O,) or خُرْب, (K, [in the M,<br>\
accord. to the TT, حرف, app. a mistranscription,])<br>\
of the وَرِك; (S, M, O, K;) [which, I think, will<br>\
be plainly seen from what follows to mean the<br>\
flesh that is upon the sacro-ischiatic foramen;<br>\
though خُرْبَةُ الوَرِكِ and خُرْبُ الوَرِكِ are said in the<br>\
TA, in art. خرب, to mean “ the hole where the<br>\
head of the thigh-bone is inserted; ”] so says<br>\
A &#39;Obeyd: (S, O:) or, (S, M, O, K,) as some<br>\
say, so adds A &#39;Obeyd, (S, O,) a certain vein (T,<br>\
S, M, O, K) in the خُرْبَة of the وَرِك, descending<br>\
into the leg, (T,) or in the thigh: (S, O:) As<br>\
says, in “ the Book of the Horse,” in the وَرِك is<br>\
the خُرْبَة, which is a نُقْرَة wherein is flesh, no<br>\
bone being in it; and in that نُقْرَة is the فَائِل,<br>\
and there is no bone between the said نقرة and<br>\
the belly, but only skin and flesh; (T, * S, O;)<br>\
and he cites the saying of El-Aashà,<br>\
قَدْ نَخْضِبُ العَيْرَ فِى مَكْنُونِ فَائِلِهِ<br>\
وَقَدْ يَشِيطُ عَلَى أَرْمَاحِنَا البَطَلُ<br>\
[Oft we stain the ridge of the spear-head in what<br>\
is concealed in the interior of his فائل, and oft the<br>\
man of valour dies by means of our spears]; مَكْنُونُ<br>\
الفَائِلِ means his blood: he says [by implication],<br>\
we are skilful in respect of the place of piercing:<br>\
(S, O:) but As said مِنْ in the place of فِى; and<br>\
AA, قَدْ نَطْعُنُ; which has been pronounced to<br>\
be wrong: (O:) or the فَائِلَانِ, (T, M,) or the<br>\
↓ فَائِلَتَانِ, (so in the K, [app. a mistranscription,])<br>\
are two veins entering into the interior parts of<br>\
the thighs (T, M, K,) in the hinder parts thereof;<br>\
(M, K;) and they adduce as an evidence thereof<br>\
the verse of El-Aashà cited above, saying that the<br>\
epithet مكنون would not have been used if the<br>\
فائل were not a vein; but others say that [the<br>\
poet meant that] he made the spear-head to<br>\
become concealed in the furthest part of the flesh;<br>\
and if the فائل were a vein, it would not have<br>\
been mentioned as it has been in a phrase of<br>\
Imra-el-Keys which will be cited in what follows:<br>\
(M:) [hence it is said,] or they are two portions<br>\
of flesh [between which is the lower part of the os<br>\
sacrum, i. e.] the lower parts of which are upon the<br>\
صَلَوَان [dual of صَلًا], from the region of the lower<br>\
portions of the حَجَبَتَانِ to the عَجْب, bordering<br>\
upon the عُصْعُص on either side, descending in the<br>\
two sides of the two thighs; [so in a human being,]<br>\
and thus in the horse: (M, K: [for the meanings<br>\
of the words that I have here left untranslated, I<br>\
must refer to their several proper arts.; as they<br>\
are variously explained:]) ↓ الفَالُ is a dial. var. of<br>\
الفَائِلُ; (M, K, TA;) which is expl. by Sgh [in<br>\
the O] as meaning a certain vein issuing from the<br>\
فَوَّارَة of the وَرِك [i. e. from the sacro-ischiatic<br>\
foramen]: (TA:) [but the assertion that الفال<br>\
is a dial. var. of الفائل seems to be founded only<br>\
upon what here follows:] Imra-el-Keys says,<br>\
[describing a horse,]<br>\
لَهُ حَجَبَاتٌ مُشْرِفَاتٌ عَلَى الفَالِ<br>\
(S, M; or على الفَالِى, as in the O and TA;) [i. e.<br>\
He has edges of the haunch-bones projecting above,<br>\
or beyond, the فائل; for] he means على فَائِلِ,<br>\
having altered the latter word by transposition.<br>\
(T, S, O, TA.)<br>\
فَائِلَةٌ: see its dual in the next preceding paragraph, near the middle.<br>\
أَفْيَلُ [More, and most, weak, or erroneous;<br>\
relating to a judgment, or an opinion]. أَفْيَلُ مِنَ<br>\
الرَّأْىِ الدَّبَرِىِّ is a prov., meaning [More weak]<br>\
than an opinion that is given after the affair [to<br>\
which it relates] has passed. (Meyd.)<br>\
مُفَايِلٌ [in the S and O in art. فأل, with ء, i. e.<br>\
مُفَائِلٌ,] Playing at the game called الفَيَالُ.<br>\
(M, O.)<br>\
المُفَايَلَةُ expl. as a subst.: see الفَيَالُ.<br>\
مَفْيُولَآء [a quasi-pl. n. (like مَشْيُوخَآءُ &amp;c.), but<br>\
one of which the sing. (if it have one) is not mentioned,] The young ones of the فِيل [or elephant].<br>\
