زَمَنَ الفِطَحْلِ إِذَاالسِّلَامُ رِطَابُ<br>\
[In the time of the فطحل, when the stones were<br>\

the new-born young one of the dabb (which is said<br>\
to be seven hundred years), or the life of Noah<br>\
in the time of the fitahl, when the rocks were moist<br>\

pledge of a grave or of slaughter]: (S, * O, TA:<br>\

one says, كَانَ ذٰلِكَ زَمَنَ الفِطَحْلِ [That was in<br>\
the time of the fitahl]; a prov., in which the last<br>\
word is said to have the first, or the third, of the<br>\

a thing that happened long ago; (Meyd: [see<br>\
also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. ii. 340:]) and أَتَيْتُكَ<br>\
