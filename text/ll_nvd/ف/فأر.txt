فَئِرَ, aor. يَفْأَرُ, It (a place) became abundant<br>\
in فَأْر [i. e. rats, or mice]. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  فَأَرَ, (J, O,)<br>\
aor. as above, (K,) inf. n. فَأْرٌ, (TK,) He dug;<br>\
(K;) or dug as does the فَأْر [i. e. rat, or mouse]:<br>\
(M, TA:) and, (K,) as some say, (M, TA,) he<br>\
buried, and hid. (M, * O, K, TA.)<br>\
فَأْرٌ [A kind of animal,] well known, (M, K,) [the<br>\
genus mus; the rat; the mouse; and the like];<br>\
with ء, (Lth, S, Msb,) and without ء; (Msb;)<br>\
[a coll. gen. n.:] n. un. with ة: (Lth, T:) [in the<br>\
S and O and Msb, فَأْرٌ is said to be pl. of فَأْرَةٌ, but<br>\
in the last is added, like تَمْرَةٌ and تَمْرٌ, showing<br>\
that by pl. is meant coll. gen. n.:] the pl. of فأر,<br>\
(Lth, T, M, K,) or of فأرة, (O, Msb,) is فِئْرَانٌ<br>\
(Lth, T, M, O, K, Msb) and فِئِرَةٌ: (M, K:) accord.<br>\
to IAar, (T, TA,) ↓ فُؤَرٌ, like صُرَدٌ, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
is applied to the male: (T, O, K, TA:) but this<br>\
last word occurs in the phrase الفَأْر الفُؤَر, [in<br>\
which الفأر is evidently used in a sense mentioned<br>\
below, namely, “the muscles,” as is indicated in<br>\
the T and O,] and, accord. to some, [الفُؤَر is a<br>\
corroborative epithet, for they say that] this<br>\
phrase is like لَيْلٌ لَائِلٌ and يَوْمٌ أَيْوَمُ: (O:) فَأْرَةٌ<br>\
is applied [accord. to some] to the female; (M;)<br>\
or [more correctly] to the male and the female,<br>\
(M, K,) like as حَمَامَةٌ is applied to the male and<br>\
the female of the [genus] حَمَام. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also Musk: (M, K:) this is sometimes called<br>\
فَأْرٌ because it is from the [animal, or from a kind<br>\
of animal, called] فَأْر, as some say. (M.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And فَأْرَةُ المِسْكِ signifies The bag, follicle, or<br>\
vesicle, (نَافِجَة, S, M, O, K, or نَافِقَة, T,) of musk:<br>\
(T, S, M, O, K:) and is also without ء; (M,<br>\
Msb;) or it should correctly be mentioned in<br>\
art. فور, [as being called فَارَةٌ] because of the<br>\
spreading (فَوَرَان) of its odour: or it may be with<br>\
ء because it has the appearance, or form, of the<br>\
[animal called] فَأْرَة. (O, K.) It was said to an<br>\
Arab of the desert أَتَهْمِزُ الفَأْرَةَ, (K, TA, in the<br>\
CK أَتُهْمَزُ الفَأْرُ,) [meaning Dost thou pronounce<br>\
فارة with hemz?], and he replied, [understanding<br>\
the animal so called to be meant,] الهِرَّةُ تَهْمِزُهَا,<br>\
(K,) meaning, [The cat] bites it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
[Hence, app., by a synecdoche, فَأْرَةُ المِسْكِ is<br>\
applied to The mush-animal, or Tibet-musk;<br>\
moschus moschiferus:] El-Jáhidh says, I asked<br>\
a perfumer, of [the sect of] the Moatezileh, respecting [the animal called] فأرة المسك, and he<br>\
said, it is not a mouse, or rat, (فأرة,) but is more<br>\
like a young gazelle: it is found in the region of<br>\
Tubbat [or Tibet]; and is hunted; and the man<br>\
who catches it binds tightly its navel, [or rather<br>\
its umbilical follicle,] which being pendent, the<br>\
blood collects in it; then it is slaughtered; and<br>\
when it is quiet, he cuts out the bound navel, and<br>\
buries it in barley (شعير) until the congealed<br>\
blood becomes converted into strong-scented musk.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And فَأْرَةُ الإِبِلِ signifies The sweet odour<br>\
of the camels, [likened to that of the vesicle of<br>\
musk,] which diffuses itself from them when they<br>\
have pastured upon the herbs and their blossoms,<br>\
(S, O,) or, as some say, upon the [plant called]<br>\
خُزَامَى [q. v.], (O,) and then drunk, and returned<br>\
from the water, with their skins moist: (S, O:)<br>\
so says Yaakoob. (S.) Thus in a verse cited<br>\
voce ذَفِرٌ. (S, O. [Therefore فَأْرَةٌ ذَفْرَآءُ should<br>\
there be rendered A pungent sweet odour like<br>\
that of a vesicle of musk. But see فَارَة, in art.<br>\
فور.])<br>\
-A2-  الفَأْرُ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The muscles: (T,<br>\
O:) and فَأْرُ المَتْنِ (assumed tropical:)  the flesh on either side of the<br>\
back-bone; as also يَرَابِيعُ المَتْنِ. (T. [See also<br>\
الفَارُ, in art. فور.])<br>\
-A3-  And A species of trees;<br>\
with and without ء: (M:) and فَأْرَةٌ [as its n. un.]<br>\
a tree [of that species]. (K.)<br>\
-A4-  Also A certain<br>\
well-known measure, or quantity, of wheat: in<br>\
this sense an adventitious word. (O.)<br>\
فُؤَرٌ: see فَأْرٌ, first sentence.<br>\
فَئِرٌ A place abounding with فَأْر [rats, or mice].<br>\
(S, O.) You say أَرْضٌ فَئِرَةٌ, (O, K,) and أَرْضٌ<br>\
↓ مَفْأَرَةٌ, (S, O, K,) Land abounding with فأر:<br>\
(K:) or land containing فأر. (S, O,) [In my<br>\
copy of the Msb, I find ↓ مَكَانٌ مَفْأَرٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Milk,<br>\
(M, K,) and food, (TA,) into which a rat, or<br>\
mouse, (فأرة,) has fallen. (M, K, TA.)<br>\
فَأْرَةٌ n. un. (but said by some to be fem.) of فَأْرٌ<br>\
[q. v.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S, M, O, K,) and ↓ فُؤْرَةٌ, (M,<br>\
K, in the O written فُؤَرَة,) both with and without ء, (M, O,) A flatus (S, M, O, K) that<br>\
collects (S) in the pastern (S, M, O, K) of a<br>\
camel, (S,) or of a beast, (M, K,) or of a horse;<br>\
(O;) which issues (S, M, O, K) when it is felt,<br>\
(S,) or when it is stroked, and collects when it is<br>\
left to itself. (M, O, K.)<br>\
