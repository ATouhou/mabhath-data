opened,] a vein; (S, O, K,) as also ↓ افتصد. (S, *<br>\

فَصِدَ, inf. n. فَصْدٌ (M, L,<br>\
Msb) and فِصَادٌ, (M, L,) or the latter is a simple<br>\
subst., (Msb,) He cut, or slit, [or opened,] it,<br>\
namely, a vein, (M, L.) [And app., accord. to<br>\
the Msb, He bled him by opening a vein; agreeably with what here follows.] And one says also,<br>\
فَصَدَ النَّاقَةَ He slit [or opened] a vein of the she-camel to draw forth the blood therefrom and to<br>\
drink it [or to put it in a gut and broil it: see<br>\
فَصِيدٌ]. (M L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  لَمْ يُحْرَمْ مَنْ فُصْدَ لَهُ He has<br>\
not been denied the entertainment of a guest for<br>\
whom a camel has been bled by the slitting [or<br>\
opening] of a vein and who has had the blood so<br>\
obtained, (M, A, * K,) is a prov.; (S, M, A, O;)<br>\
فُصْدَ being for فُصِدَ, (S, M, O, K,) like ضُرْبَ for<br>\
ضُرِبَ, and قُتْلَ for قُتِلَ; (M;) and some, also,<br>\
say فُزْدَ; (S, M, O, K;) for every quiescent ص<br>\
before د may be changed into ز; and every<br>\
movent ص before د may have somewhat of the<br>\
sound of ز given to it, (S, M, O,) but may not in<br>\
this case be altogether changed into ز; so that for<br>\
صَدَرَ and صَدَفَ you may not say زَدَرَ and زَدَفَ:<br>\
(M:) some, also, say مَنْ قُصِدَ لَهُ, with ق, meaning مَنْ أُعْطِىَ قَصْدًا i. e. [who has been given] a<br>\
little: (S, O, K:) the origin of the saying was<br>\
this: two men passed the night at the abode of<br>\
an Arab of the desert, and, meeting in the morning, one of them asked his companion respecting<br>\
the entertainment given by the host, and the<br>\
latter answered, “I was not entertained as a<br>\
guest, but only a vein [of a camel] was slit [or<br>\
opened] to draw blood for me; ” whereupon the<br>\
other replied in the words above: (O, K:) or a<br>\
man used to entertain another as his guest in a<br>\
time of scarcity, and, having no food to offer him,<br>\
and being unwilling to slaughter his camel, bled<br>\
it by slitting [or opening] a vein, and heated the<br>\
blood that came forth, for his guest, until it<br>\
became thick, and gave it to him to eat; and<br>\
hence this prov.: (M, L:) it is applied to him<br>\
who has obtained a part of that which he wanted.<br>\
