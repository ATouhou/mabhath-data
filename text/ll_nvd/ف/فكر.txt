فَكَرَ فِيهِ, (O, * Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
فَكُرَ, (O, TK,)<br>\
or<br>\
فَكِرَ, (Msb,) inf. n. فَكْرٌ; (S, O, Msb, K; *) and<br>\
↓ أَفْكَرَ; (S, O, Msb, K;) and ↓ فكّر, (S, O, K,)<br>\
[which is more common than either of the first<br>\
and second,] inf. n. تَفْكِيرٌ; (O, TA;) and ↓ تفكّر;<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K;) and ↓ افتكر, (Msb, TA,) but this<br>\
last is vulgar; (TA;) He thought upon it, considered it, or examined it [mentally]; (Msb;) he<br>\
considered it in order to obtain a clear knowledge<br>\
of it; (S, O, * TA;) he employed his mind, (M,<br>\
TA,) or his consideration, (K, TA,) upon it.<br>\
(M, K, TA.) [See also فِكْرٌ.]<br>\

فَكَّرَ 4, 5, and 8: see the preceding paragraph.<br>\
فَكْرٌ inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. ―<br>\
-b2-  لَيْسَ لِى فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ<br>\
فَكْرٌ, (Yaakoob, S, O, K, *) which is more chaste<br>\
than ↓ فِكْرٌ, [in this case,] (Yaakoob, S, O,) but<br>\
the latter is sometimes used, (K,) means I have<br>\
no want, or need, of this thing: (Yaakoob, S, O,<br>\
K: *) or, as is said in the A, لَا فَكْرَ لِى فِى هٰذَا i. e.<br>\
I have no want, or need, of this, nor do I care for<br>\
it. (TA.)<br>\
فِكْرٌ and ↓ فِكْرَةٌ (S, O, Msb, K) and ↓ فِكْرَى,<br>\
(Lth, O, K,) are simple substs., (S, O, Msb, *)<br>\
but the last is of rare occurrence, (Lth, O,) signifying Thought, consideration, or [mental] examination, فِى أَمْرٍ [respecting a thing]; (Msb;) consideration [of a thing] in order to obtain a clear<br>\
knowledge [of it]; (S, TA;) the employment of<br>\
the mind, (M, TA,) or of the consideration, (K,<br>\
TA,) upon a thing: (M, K, TA:) or repeated<br>\
consideration for the purpose of seeking [to discover] meanings: or the arranging of things in<br>\
the mind in order, by them, to arrive at some<br>\
object of which the attainment is desired, though<br>\
it be but a preponderating opinion: (Msb:) or<br>\
the arranging of known things [in the mind] in<br>\
order to attain to [the knowledge of] an unknown<br>\
[thing]: (KT:) pl. of the first أَفْكَارٌ: (IDrd, K;)<br>\
but Sb says that neither فِكْرٌ nor عِلْمٌ nor نَظَرٌ has<br>\
any pl.: (TA:) the pl. of ↓ فِكْرَةٌ is فِكَرٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
One says, لِفُلَانٍ فِكَرٌ كُلُّهَا فِقَرٌ [Such a one has<br>\
thoughts all of which are points of wit]. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also فَكْرٌ.<br>\
فِكْرَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph; the<br>\
former in two places.<br>\
فِكْرَى: see the next preceding paragraph; the<br>\
former in two places.<br>\
فِكِّيرٌ [Thoughtful;] having much فِكْر; (IF, S,<br>\
O, K;) as also ↓ فَيْكَرٌ. (Kr, K.)<br>\
فَيْكَرٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
