to El-&#39;Otbee, [land] that takes, or receives, much<br>\
water, and does not dry it up: and as to ↓ جَرْزٌ,<br>\
it may be an inf. n. used as an epithet, as though<br>\
meaning ذَاتُ جَرْزٍ, i. e., of which the herbage has<br>\
been eaten: also ↓ أَرْضٌ مَجْرُوزَةٌ is explained as<br>\
signifying land of which the herbage has been<br>\
consumed by the locusts or the sheep or goats or<br>\
the camels or the like: (TA:) and ↓ مَفَازَةٌ مِجْرَازٌ<br>\
a barren desert: (A, * K:) [see also جَارِزٌ:] the<br>\
pl. of جُرْزٌ is جِرَزَةٌ, like as جِحَرَةٌ is pl. of جُحْرٌ;<br>\
and that of جَرَزٌ is أَجْرَازٌ, like as أَسْبَابٌ is<br>\
pl. of سَبَبٌ: (S:) and one says also أَرْضٌ أَجْرَازٌ,<br>\

جَرْزَةٌ, (S, A,) or ↓ جَرَزَةٌ, with fet-h to the ر, (K,<br>\
TA,) Extirpation: (S, A:) or destruction. (K,<br>\
TA.) Hence the saying, لَنْ تَرْضَى شَانِئَةٌ إِلَّا<br>\
بِجَرْزَةٍ A female that hates, by reason of the vehemence of her hatred, will not be content save<br>\
with extirpation [of the object of her hatred]:<br>\
(S:) or لَمْ يَرْضَ شَانِئُهُ إِلَّا بِجَرْزَةٍ, (A,) or ↓ بَجَرَزَةٍ,<br>\
(TA,) His hater was not content save with extirpation of him whom he hated. (A, TA.) You<br>\
say also, ↓ رَمَاهُ اللّٰهُ بِشَرَزَةٍ وجَرَزَةٍ, [or بِشَرْزَةٍ وَجَرْزَةٍ,<br>\
thus, only, the former word is written in the K<br>\
and TA in art. شرز, and I think that the latter is<br>\
correctly written in like manner, as in the S and<br>\
A,] God smote him with destruction [and extirpation]. (TA.)<br>\

قَتّ (A, Mgh, Msb, K) or the like: (Mgh, Msb,<br>\

likening her to such a sword, إِنَّهَا لَجُرَازٌ لِلشَّجَرِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Verily she is one that eats and breaks the trees.<br>\
