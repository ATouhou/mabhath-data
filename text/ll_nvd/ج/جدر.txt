-A3-  جُدِرَ,<br>\
(A, K,) inf. n. جَدْرٌ; (TA;) and جَدَرَ, (Lh, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
جَدُرَ, inf. n. جَدْرٌ; (Lh, TA;) and ↓ جُدِّرَ, (S,<br>\
(A, K,) which last some disallow, because this form<br>\
denotes repetition, and the verb signifies the having<br>\
a disease that befalls but once in a man&#39;s life;<br>\
(MF;) He (a man, S, or a child, A) had, or<br>\
became attacked by, جُدَرِىّ [or small-pox]. (S,<br>\
A, K.) [And جَدَرَ الجُدَرِىُّ The small-pox came<br>\
forth, or broke out; as in the TK: for its inf. n.]<br>\
جَدْرٌ signifies the coming forth, or breaking out,<br>\
of the جُدَرِىّ. (K.)<br>\
-A4-  جَدُرَ, aor.<br>\
جَدُرَ, inf. n. جَدَارَةٌ,<br>\
He, or it, was, or became, adapted, disposed,<br>\
apt, meet, suited, suitable, fitted, fit, competent,<br>\
proper, or worthy. (K.) You say, جَدُرَ بِهِ [and<br>\
لَهُ ] He was, or became, adapted, disposed, apt,<br>\
&amp;c., for it. (A.) [And  جَدُرَ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا  He<br>\
was, or became, adapted, disposed, apt, &amp;c., for<br>\
doing such a thing. See  جَدِيرٌ .]<br>\

How well adapted or disposed, or how apt, meet,<br>\
&amp;c., is he for doing that! or how worthy is he<br>\
to do that! (TA.) The usage of جَدُرَ, signifying “ he was, or became, adapted, &amp;c.,” refutes<br>\
the assertion of certain grammarians that these<br>\
two forms of the verb deviate from general rule.<br>\

or constructed it firmly and strongly, and raised<br>\
it high; syn. شَيَّدَهُ. (K, TA.) [In the CK, we<br>\
read اِجتَدَرَ بِنَاهُ, as though the pronoun ه referred<br>\
to the word جِدَار, which precedes; and thus the<br>\
verb signified “ he built a wall; ” but it is shown<br>\
in the TA that the right reading is that given<br>\
above.]<br>\
