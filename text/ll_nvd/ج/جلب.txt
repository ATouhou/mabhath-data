جَلَبَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
جَلِبَ and<br>\
جَلُبَ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) inf. n. جَلْبٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and<br>\
جَلَبٌ, (S, K,) He drove, (A, K,) or brought,<br>\
conveyed, or transported, (Mgh,) a thing, (S, A, *<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K, *) or things, such as camels, sheep,<br>\
goats, horses, captives, or slaves, or any merchandise, (TA,) from one place to another, (A,<br>\
K,) or from one country or town to another, for<br>\
the purpose of traffic; (Mgh;) as also ↓ اجتلب,<br>\
(A, K, KL,) and ↓ استجلب. (KL.) And جَلَبْتُ<br>\
الشَّىْءَ إِلَي نَفْسِى and ↓ اِجْتَلَبْتُهُ signify the same;<br>\
(S;) i. e. (assumed tropical:)  I brought, drew, attracted, or procured, the thing to myself. (PS.) [Hence,] ذَا<br>\
مِمَّا يَجْلِبُ الإِخْوَانَ (tropical:)  [This is of the things that<br>\
bring, draw, attract, or procure, brothers, or<br>\
friends]. (A, TA.) And الدَّهْرِ ↓ جَلَبَتُهُ جَوَالِبُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [The calamities of time, or of fortune, or of fate,<br>\
brought, drew, or attracted, him, or it]. (A, TA.)<br>\
[Hence also, accord. to some,] لَا جَلَبَ وَ لَا جَنَبَ, a<br>\
trad., explained as meaning, The owner of cattle<br>\
shall not be required to drive them, or bring them,<br>\
to the town, or country, in order that the collector<br>\
may take from them the portion appointed for<br>\
the poor-rate, but this shall be taken at the<br>\
waters; and when the cattle are in the yards,<br>\
they shall be left therein, and not brought forth<br>\
to the place of pasture, for the collector to take<br>\
that portion: or, as some say, ولا جنب means,<br>\
nor shall one have a horse led by his side, in a<br>\
race, in order that, when he draws near to the<br>\
goal, he may tranfser himself to it, and so outstrip his fellow: and other explanations have been<br>\
given: (Msb:) [accord. to some,] لا جلب here<br>\
means, they shall not drive, or bring, their cattle<br>\
to the collector of the portions appointed for the<br>\
poor-rate in the place where he alights, but he<br>\
shall himself come to their yards and take those<br>\
portions: or [جلب here is from the verb جَلَبَ<br>\
in a sense which will be explained below, and]<br>\
the trad. relates to horse-racing, and means, one<br>\
shall not cause his horse to be followed by a man<br>\
crying out at it and chiding it; nor shall he have<br>\
a horse without a rider led by his own horse, in<br>\
order that, when he draws near to the goal, he<br>\
may transfer himself to it, and outstrip upon it:<br>\
(Mgh:) or الجَلَبُ, which is forbidden, means<br>\
the collector&#39;s not coming to the people at their<br>\
waters to take the portions appointed for the<br>\
poor-rate, but ordering them to drive, or bring,<br>\
their cattle to him: or it relates to contending for<br>\
a stake, or wager, and means the mounting a<br>\
man upon one&#39;s horse, and, when he has drawn<br>\
near to the goal, following his horse and crying<br>\
out at it, in order that it may outstrip; which is<br>\
a kind of fraud: (S:) or it is used in both these<br>\
cases: (A &#39;Obeyd: [his explanations are virtually<br>\
the same as those in the S:]) or the meaning of<br>\
the trad. [so far as the former clause of it is concerned] is, that the contributions to the poor-rate<br>\
shall not be driven, or brought, to the waters nor<br>\
to the great towns, but shall be given in their<br>\
places of pasture: or it means, [or rather الجلب<br>\
means,] the collector&#39;s alighting in a place, and<br>\
then sending a person, or persons, to drive, or<br>\
bring, to him the cattle from their places, that he<br>\
may take the portion thereof appointed for the<br>\
poor-rate: or it [relates to horse-racing, and]<br>\
means the sending forth a horse in the racecourse, and a number of persons&#39; congregating,<br>\
and crying out at it, in order that it may be<br>\
turned from its course: or a man&#39;s following his<br>\
horse, and spurring on behind it, and chiding it,<br>\
and crying out at it: (K, TA:) or the shaking a<br>\
thing behind a horse that is backward in a race,<br>\
that it may be urged on thereby, and outstrip:<br>\
or one&#39;s riding a horse, and leading behind him<br>\
another, to urge it on, in contending for a stake,<br>\
or wager: or the crying out at a horse from<br>\
behind, and urging it to outstrip. (TA. See<br>\
also 1 in art. جنب.) ―<br>\
-b2-  جَلَبَ لأَهْلِهِ He gained or<br>\
earned; sought or sought after or sought to gain<br>\
[provisions &amp;c.; generally meaning he purveyed];<br>\
and exercised art or cunning or skill, in the management of his affairs; for his family; as also<br>\
↓ اجلب. (Lh, K.)<br>\
-A2-  جَلَبُوا, aor.<br>\
جَلِبَ and<br>\
جَلُبَ, (K,)<br>\
[inf. n. جَلَبٌ, and perhaps جَلَبَةٌ also;] and ↓ جلّبوا;<br>\
(S, K;) and ↓ اجلبوا, (K,) inf. n. إِجْلَابٌ; (Mgh;)<br>\
[the second of which is the most common;] They<br>\
raised cries, shouts, noises, a clamour, (S, Mgh,<br>\
TA,) or confused cries or shouts or noises. (Mgh,<br>\
K. *) And جَلَبَ عَلَي فَرَسِهِ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
جَلُبَ,<br>\
(S, Msb,) inf. n. جَلَبٌ, (S,) or جَلْبٌ, (Msb,) He<br>\
chid, or urged on, his horse; as also ↓ جلّب and<br>\
↓ اجلب; (K;) the first, rare; the second and<br>\
third, usual: (TA:) he cried out at his horse,<br>\
(S, K,) from behind him, and urged him to outstrip [in a race], (S,) aor.<br>\
جَلُبَ and<br>\
جَلِبَ; (K; but this<br>\
explanation is erased in the copy of the K in its<br>\
author&#39;s handwriting, as being a repetition; and<br>\
rightly, accord. to MF; though this requires consideration; TA;) as also ↓ اجلب: (S:) he urged<br>\
his horse to run, by striking, or goading, or by<br>\
crying out, or the like; as also ↓ اجلب: or, as<br>\
some say, he led behind his horse that he was<br>\
riding another horse to urge on the former, in<br>\
contending [in a race] for a stake, or wager; as<br>\
is shown in an explanation of the tradition cited<br>\
above, لَا جَلَبَ وَلَا جَنَبَ. (TA.) It is said in the<br>\
Kur [xvii. 66], عَلَيْهِمْ بِخَيْلِكَ وَرَجْلِكَ ↓ وَأَجْلِبْ<br>\
And raise thou confused cries against them,<br>\
(Mgh,) or cry out against them, with thy forces<br>\
riding and on foot. (Bd. But see another explanation in what follows.) And it is said in a wellknown prov., جَلَبَتْ جَلْبَةً ثُمَّ أَمْسَكَتْ It, i. e. a<br>\
cloud (سَحَابَة), thundered, then refrained from<br>\
raining: applied to a coward, who threatens, and<br>\
then is silent: but accord. to some, it is with ح<br>\
in the place of ج (MF. See art. حلب.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] جَلَبَ, aor.<br>\
جَلِبَ and<br>\
جَلُبَ; and ↓ اجلب; He<br>\
threatened with evil; (K, TA;) followed by an<br>\
accus. (TA) [or, app., by عَلَى before the object]:<br>\
or (so in the TA, but in some copies of the K<br>\
“ and,”) he collected a company, a troop, or an<br>\
army. (K, TA.) [It is said that] عَلَيْهِمْ ↓ وَأَجْلِبْ,<br>\
in the Kur [xvii. 66], means And collect thou<br>\
against them [thy forces], and threaten them with<br>\
evil. (TA. But see another explanation above.)<br>\
And عَلَيْهِ ↓ اجلبو signifies also They collected<br>\
themselves together against him, (S, K, *) and<br>\
aided one another; like احلبوا. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  جَلَبَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ, aor.<br>\
جَلُبَ, inf. n. جَلْبٌ, He committed a crime<br>\
against him; or an offence for which he should<br>\

جَلُبَ,<br>\

ulcer, As, or a wound, S) became covered with a<br>\
skin in healing: (As, S:) as also ↓ اجلب. (S,<br>\

also ↓ اجلب. (Lh, K.)<br>\
-A4-  جَلِبَ, aor.<br>\
جَلَبَ, It [app.<br>\
a company or troop] assembled, or became collected<br>\
together. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
جَلَّبَ see 1, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  The inf. n. تَجْلِيبٌ<br>\
also signifies The act of bringing together: or<br>\
collecting. (KL.)<br>\
3<br>\
جَاْلَبَ [جالب is explained by Golius, as on the<br>\
authority of the KL, as meaning He helped, or<br>\
assisted: but this is a mistake for حالب; for I<br>\
find مُحَالَبَةٌ explained by يارى كردن in a copy<br>\
of the KL, and the order of the words there shows<br>\
that it is not a mistranscriptiou for مجالبة.]<br>\
4<br>\
اجلب: see 1, in eleven places, in the latter<br>\
half of the paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  Also His camels brought<br>\
forth males; (S, K;) because the males that<br>\
they produce are driven, or brought, from one<br>\
place to another, and sold; opposed to احلب<br>\
“ his camels brought forth females: ” (S:) and<br>\
his camel brought forth a male. (TA.) أَجْلَبْتَ<br>\
وَلَا أَحْلَبْتَ May thy camels bring forth males,<br>\
and may they not bring forth females, is a form<br>\
of imprecation against a man, implying a wish<br>\
that he may lose the milk [that he would have<br>\
otherwise]. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  He aided, helped, or assisted,<br>\
another. (S, K.) [So, too, احلب.]<br>\
-A4-  He put<br>\
an amulet into a جُلْبَة [which must therefore signify the piece of skin in which an amulet is<br>\
enclosed, as well as an amulet enclosed in a piece<br>\
of skin: see مُجْلِبٌ]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اجلب قَتَبَهُ, (S,<br>\
K,) inf. n. إِجْلابٌ, (T,) He covered his قتب [or<br>\
camel&#39;s saddle] (S, K) with a جُلْبَة, i. e., (S,)<br>\
with a piece of fresh, moist skin, which he left<br>\
upon it until it became dry [and tight]: (S, K: *)<br>\
or he covered the head of his قتب with a piece<br>\
of kid&#39;s, or lamb&#39;s, skin, and left it to dry upon<br>\
it. (T.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَجَلَّبَ [تجلّب rendered by Golius Clamorem ac<br>\
murmur excitavit, as on the authority of the K,<br>\
I do not find in that lexicon nor in any other.]<br>\
7<br>\
انجلب It [a camel, sheep, goat, horse,<br>\
captive, or slave, or a number of camels &amp;c., or<br>\
any merchandise, (see 1, first sentence,)] was<br>\
driven [or brought] from one place to another [or<br>\

10<br>\
استجلبهُ He sought, or demanded, or desired,<br>\
that it [a camel, sheep, goat, horse, captive, or<br>\
slave, or a number of camels &amp;c., or any merchandise, (see 1, first sentence,)] should be driven<br>\
[or brought] from one place to another [in which<br>\
he was, or from one country or town to another,<br>\
for sale]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, first sentence.<br>\

جَلْبَبَهُ, (K,) or جلببهُ جِلْبَابًا, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. جَلْبَبَةٌ, the second ب not being incorporated<br>\
into the first because the word is quasi-coordinate<br>\
to the class of دَحْرَجَةٌ, (S,) He put on him a garment of the kind called جِلْبَاب. (S, K.) Accord.<br>\
to Kh, the first ب in جلبب is [augmentative]<br>\
like the و in جَهْوَرَ and دَهْوَرَ: accord. to Yoo,<br>\
the second is [augmentative] like the ى in سَلْقَى<br>\

thinks it a mistake,]) and ↓ جَلِيبَةٌ and ↓ جُلُوبَةٌ:<br>\
(K:) [see this last, below:] pl. [of the first]<br>\
أَجْلَابٌ. (K.) Hence the prov., النُّفَاضُ يُقَطِّرُ<br>\
الجَلَبَ The failure of provisions causes the<br>\
camels, driven, or brought, from one place to<br>\
another, to be disposed in files for sale. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [And, app., Male camels; like جَلُوبَةٌ; because<br>\

q. v.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also Persons who drive, or bring, camels<br>\

former, but not explained by any one except the<br>\
author of the K; masc. and fem.; (TA;) A<br>\
