roughness and hoarseness, (Kh, K,) and followed<br>\
by a gradual fall (تَحَدُّر) [of the voice] modulated<br>\
in accordance to that same sound, and then followed by a sound [in my original بِوَشْىٍ, but I<br>\
think it probable that this is a mistranscription for<br>\
بِوَحْىٍ, or بِوَحًى, or the like, for, though وَشْىٌ<br>\
might perhaps, by straining a metaphor, be applied<br>\
to denote a varied sound, its being understood in<br>\
this sense seems to be forbidden by its being here<br>\
added] like the first. (Kh, TA.) [This explanation is perhaps illustrated by the fact that the bass<br>\
in the music of the Arabs is often formed of one<br>\
prolonged note, falling and rising.] ―<br>\
