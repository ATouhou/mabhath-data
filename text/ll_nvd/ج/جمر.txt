extinguished by confederating with Er-Ribáb,<br>\
and the second by confederating with Medhhij;<br>\
the third only remaining [a جمرة] because it<br>\
formed no confederacy: (S:) or it is applied to<br>\

pebbles, TA) were cast; (S, K;) each of these<br>\
being a heap of pebbles, at Minè, and each two<br>\
heaps [or rather each heap and that next to it]<br>\
being about a bow-shot apart: (Msb:) accord. to<br>\
Th, from جَمَرَهُ “ he put him aside, apart, away,<br>\
or at a distance: ” or from أَجْمَرَ “ he hastened; ”<br>\
because Adam pelted Iblees in Minè, and he<br>\
