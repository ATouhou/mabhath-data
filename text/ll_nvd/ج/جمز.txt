جَمَزَ, (S, A, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
جَمِزَ, inf. n. جَمْزٌ (S,<br>\
Msb, K) and جَمَزَى, (K,) or the latter is a<br>\
simple subst., (Msb,) said of a camel, (S, K,)<br>\
and of a man, (A, K,) [He went at a gentle trot<br>\
or run;] he went a pace quicker than that termed<br>\
عَنَقٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) but not so quick as that<br>\
termed حُضْرٌ, (K,) or not so quick as a vehement<br>\
حُضْر; (TA;) he went the pace with which corpses<br>\
are conveyed [to the tomb; which, according to<br>\
the practice prescribed by Mohammad, is a quick<br>\
pace]: (TA:) or simply, he went, or went along:<br>\
(Msb:) and he ran; syn. عَدَا: (Mgh, Msb:)<br>\
and he went quickly. (Mgh, Msb, TA.) You<br>\
say, جَمَزَ بِالْجِنَازَةِ He went a pace quicker than<br>\
that termed عَنَقٌ [with the corpse upon its bier].<br>\
(A.) And جَمَزَ الرَّجُلُ فِى الأَرْضَ The man went<br>\
away into, or in, the country or land. (Kr, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
جمّز, if used, He rode a camel such as is<br>\
called جَمَّازٌ or جَمَّازَةٌ. See the act. part. n., below.]<br>\
جَمَزَى a subst. from جَمَزَ; [signifying A gentle<br>\
trot or run; a pace quicker than that termed<br>\
عَنَقٌ, but not so quick as that termed حُضْرٌ,<br>\
or not so quick as a vehement حُضْر; &amp;c.]<br>\
(Msb.) You say, هُوَ يَعْدُو الجَمَزَى, (A,) and<br>\
النَّاقَةُ تَعْدُو الجَمَزَى, and in like manner الفَرَسُ,<br>\
(Ks, S,) [He, and the she-camel, and the mare<br>\
or horse, runs at the pace termed جَمَزَى.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also جَمَّازٌ, in two places.<br>\
جَمَّازٌ, applied to a he-camel, (S, K,) and جَمَّازَةٌ,<br>\
applied to a she-camel, (K,) That is ridden by<br>\
the مُجَمِّز; (S;) that goes the pace described<br>\
above, [voce جَمَزَى and] voce جَمَزَ: (K, TA:)<br>\
[the latter is also said in the TA to be من آلَات<br>\
المحامل; but the correct reading seems to be<br>\
مِنْ أُولَات المَحَامِلِ; and the meaning, of those<br>\
that carry the vehicles called محامل, pl. of<br>\
مَحْمِل.] ―<br>\
-b2-  حِمَارٌ جَمَّازٌ An ass that leaps, jumps,<br>\
springs, or bounds, quickly: (K:) and حِمَارٌ<br>\
↓ جَمَزَى a quick ass; (S, K;) or an ass that<br>\
leaps, jumps, springs, or bounds, quickly, and is<br>\
swift; (TA;) the latter word in this phrase used<br>\
as a masc. and fem. epithet, though its final letter<br>\
is a denotative of the fem. gender. (Ham p. 277.<br>\
[See below; and see also حَيَدَى.]) Umeiyeh<br>\
Ibn-Abee-&#39;Áïdh (S, TA) El-Hudhalee (TA) says,<br>\
كَأَنِّى وَرَحْلِى إِذَا رُعْتُهَا<br>\
جَازِئٍ بِالرِّمَالِ ↓ عَلَى جَمَزَى<br>\
[As though I and my she-camel&#39;s saddle, when I<br>\
frightened her, were upon a swift wild ass satisfied with green pasture, so as to be in no need of<br>\
water, in the sands]. (S, TA.) He likens his<br>\
she-camel to a wild ass, to which he applies the<br>\
epithet جمزى, that is, swift; meaning, عَلَى حِمَارٍ<br>\
جَمَزَى. (TA.) As says that this is the only<br>\
epithet of the measure فَعَلَى heard by him applied<br>\
to a male; and that IAar cited the verse above<br>\
to him saying حَيِّدٍ بِالدِّحَالِ, meaning عَنِ الدِّحَالِ,<br>\
[i. e., “shying and turning aside from the hollows,<br>\
narrow at the top but wide below, in the ground: ”<br>\
but this is probably a reading of some in the place<br>\
of حَيَدَى بِالدِّحَالِ, which ends the next verse,<br>\
agreeably with what is said in the L in art. حيد:]<br>\
Az says that عَلَى جَمَزَى may be explained as for<br>\
عَلَى عَيْرٍ ذِى جَمَزَى, i. e., upon an ass having the<br>\
mode of pace termed جَمَزَى; and نَاقَةٌ وَكَرَى has<br>\
a similar meaning. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also مُجَمِّزٌ.<br>\
جُمَّيْزٌ (S, K) and ↓ جُمَّيْزَى (K) [The sycamorefig: and the sycamore fig-tree: ficus sycomorus;<br>\
also called the Egyptian fig:] the male fig; (K,<br>\
TA;) which is found in the Ghowr, or Ghór,<br>\
[here meaning the Valley of the Jordan,] (TA,)<br>\
and is sweet: (K, TA:) this is the yellow: the<br>\
black makes the mouth bleed: (TA:) it is of<br>\
various colours, or kinds, (أَلْوَان,) (K, * TA;)<br>\
abundant in Syria and in Egypt: n. un. جُمَّيْزَةٌ:<br>\
(TA:) [a fruit] resembling the تِين [or common<br>\
fig]: (S:) AHn says, of the kinds of fig is the<br>\
fig of the جُمَّيْز, a sweet, moist fig, which has long<br>\
fruit-stalks, and which is dried in the sun: and<br>\
there is another species of the جمّيز, the fruit of<br>\
which is like the fig in make, but its leaves are<br>\
smaller than those of the fig, and its figs are<br>\
yellow, of a small size, and black: it is found in<br>\
the Ghowr, or Ghór, and is called the male fig:<br>\
the yellow is sweet: the black makes the mouth<br>\
bleed: and its fig has no stalk, but cleaves to the<br>\
wood. (&#39;Abd-el-Lateef, Account of Egypt: White&#39;s<br>\
ed., entitled Abdollatiphi Historiæ Aegypti Compendium: p. 22. See also De Sacy&#39;s notes to his<br>\
transl. of that work, pp. 82—86.) ―<br>\
