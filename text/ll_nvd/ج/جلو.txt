reason, (TA,) the name of a certain man, (S, K,)<br>\

&amp;c.; and he who rises to eminences, or who is<br>\
accustomed to embark in, or surmount, lofty and<br>\
difficult things: when I put down the turban, ye<br>\
will know me]. (S, TA.) Sb says, (TA,) جلا in<br>\
this case is a verb in the pret. tense: &#39;Eesà Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Omar says that when a man is named قَتَلَ or ضَرَبَ<br>\
or the like, the word is imperfectly decl.; and he<br>\
adduces, in evidence, this verse: others say that<br>\
جلا may be here without tenween because it is<br>\
imitative of a phrase, as though the poet said,<br>\
أَنَا ابْنُ الَّذِى يُقَالُ لَهُ جَلَا الأُمُورِ: (S, TA:) accord.<br>\
to IB, it is without tenween because it is a verb<br>\
with its agent [implied in it]. (TA.) ―<br>\

(Har p. 498;) and so ↓ اِبْنُ أَجْلَى: (TA:) accord.<br>\

[For verily the means of deciding the truth are<br>\
three: an oath, and incongruity of circumstances,<br>\
and acknowledgment, or confession]: (S:) but<br>\
Az writes the last word ↓ جِلَآء, with kesr to the<br>\
ج, as meaning an evidence, or a proof, and witnesses; from مُجَالَاةٌ [inf. n. of 3, q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\

-A2-  Also,<br>\
(S, Mgh, K,) written by El-Muhellebee ↓ جَلَآءٌ,<br>\
(TA,) and ↓ جَلًا, which is more correct than the<br>\
first, (Mgh,) or it is allowable, as also ↓ جِلًا, the<br>\
former of the last two mentioned on the authority<br>\
of En-Nahhás, (TA,) Collyrium: (S, K:) or a<br>\
particular kind thereof, (K, TA,) that clears the<br>\
sight; (TA;) [i. e.] i. q. إِثْمِدٌ [antimony, or an<br>\

manifest, notorious, plain, obvious, or evident:<br>\
(S, Msb, K, TA:) جَالٍ thus used has not been<br>\

جِلِيَّانٌ The act of rendering apparent, open,<br>\
manifest, plain, or evident: rendering clear, or<br>\
unobscured; exposing to view, displaying, laying<br>\
open, disclosing, or uncovering. (TA.)<br>\
جَالٍ Going forth, or emigrating, from his<br>\
country, or town: [like جَالٌّ:] and so جَالِيَةٌ,<br>\
applied to a company of people; [as also جَالَّةٌ;]<br>\
(Msb;) or to people who have gone forth, or<br>\
emigrated, from their homes; (S;) and particularly to those tributaries, (Mgh, Msb,) namely,<br>\

afterwards, to such as have the poll-tax imposed<br>\
upon them, of the people of the Bible, and of the<br>\
Magians, though not having emigrated from their<br>\
homes; (Mgh;) [i. e.] the free non-Muslim subjects of a Muslim government; because they were<br>\
expelled by &#39;Omar from Arabia; (K;) the word<br>\
being fem. because denoting a جَمَاعَة; (Mgh;)<br>\
and its pl. is جَوَالٍ. (Mgh, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
(Msb,) ↓ جَالِيَةٌ [as a subst.] is applied to The<br>\
poll-tax that is exacted from the persons last<br>\
mentioned above; (S, Mgh, Msb;) as also جَالَّةٌ:<br>\
(S:) first, in this sense, applied to that which<br>\
