(L, TA:) he made, or cut, a hole in the middle<br>\
of it; cut a piece out of the middle of it; hollowed<br>\
it out; or excavated it. (TA.) You say, جاب<br>\
الصَّخْرَةَ He made a hole in the rock; (A, TA;)<br>\
perforated, pierced, or bored, it. (TA.) Hence,<br>\
in the Kur [lxxxix. 8], وَثَمُودَ الَّذِينَ جَابُوا الصَّخْرَ<br>\
بِالوَادِ (Fr, S, TA) And Thamood, who made holes<br>\
in the rocks, (Fr, TA,) or cut the rocks, (Bd,<br>\
Jel,) [or hollowed them out,] and made them<br>\
dwellings, in the valley, (Fr, Bd, Jel, TA,) i. e.,<br>\
in Wádi-l-Kurà. (Bd, Jel.) You say also, جاب<br>\

(S, K, and Msb in art. جيب;) and aor. يَجِيبُ,<br>\
(S, K,) [inf. n., app., جِيبٌ, originally جَوْبٌ; see<br>\
a verse cited below, and a remark of Sh thereon;]<br>\
and ↓ جوّبهُ; (A, K;) He hollowed out, or cut<br>\
out in a round form, the جَيْب of the shirt: (S,<br>\
and Msb in art. جيب:) or he cut the جَيْب of<br>\
the shirt: (A:) or he made a جَيْب to the shirt;<br>\
(K;) as also جَيَّبَهُ, (S, and Msb in art. جيب,)<br>\

جَوْبٌ, He cut out the sandal. (TA.) And جاب القَرْنُ<br>\
[i. e. جاب اللَّحْمَ] The horn cut the flesh and came<br>\

likewise the pouncing down of a bird. (TA.) A<br>\
rájiz says,<br>\
بَاتَتْ تَجِيبُ أَدْعَجَ الظَّلَامِ<br>\
جِيبَ البِيَطْرِ مِدْرَعَ الهُمَامِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [She passed the night cutting through the black<br>\
darkness, like as the tailor cuts through the woollen<br>\
tunic of the valiant chief, making the opening at<br>\
the neck and bosom]: (S: [but in one copy, instead of جِيبَ, I here find جَيْبَ; and in art. بطر,<br>\
شَقَّ:]) and Sh remarks that this [verb تجيب, or<br>\
the inf. n. جيب,] is not from الجَيْبُ [meaning<br>\
“ the opening at the neck and bosom ” of a shirt<br>\
&amp;c.], because its medial radical is و, and that of<br>\
الجيب is ى: (TA:) [i. e., جاب, aor. يجيب, is<br>\
originally جَوَبَ, aor. يَجْوِبُ.] One says also, of<br>\
news, يَجُوبُ الأَرْضَ مِنْ بَلَدٍ إِلَى بَلَدٍ (assumed tropical:)  [It traverses<br>\
the earth from country to country, or the land<br>\
from town to town]. (S, TA.) And of proverbs,<br>\
تَجُوبُ البِلَادَ (assumed tropical:)  They are current in the countries,<br>\
or towns. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is said in a trad., جِيبَتِ<br>\

were rent from us, like as the mill-stone is rent<br>\

so accord. to an explanation of the act. part. n.)<br>\
3<br>\
جَاْوَبَ [جاوبهُ, inf. n. مُجَاوَبَةٌ, He returned him<br>\

Msb, K, * TA) and إِجَابٌ (K, * TA) and ↓ جَابَةٌ,<br>\

S, TA,) like طَاعَةٌ and طَاقَةٌ, (S, A,) used in the<br>\
place of an inf. n.; (AHeyth, TA;) and ↓ استجابهُ<br>\
(A, K, TA) and ↓ اِسْتَجُوَبَهُ and لَهُ ↓ اِستجاب;<br>\
(K, TA;) [for] إِجَابَةٌ and ↓ اِسْتِجَابَةٌ are syn.;<br>\
(S, TA;) He answered him, replied to him,<br>\
responded to him, (Msb, TA,) either affirmatively<br>\
or negatively. (Msb.) And اجاب قَوْلَهُ He answered,<br>\
or replied to, his saying. (Msb.) And اجاب عَنْ<br>\
سُؤَالِهِ (S, TA) He answered, or replied to, his<br>\
question. (TA.) And اجاب دُعَآءَهُ, (Msb, TA, *)<br>\
and دُعَآءَهُ ↓ استجاب, (S, A, TA,) and لَهُ ↓ استجاب,<br>\
(Msb,) and مِنْهُ ↓ استجاب, (Har p. 307,) said of<br>\
God, (S, A, Msb, TA,) [He answered his prayer;;]<br>\
He accepted his prayer; (Msb;) He recompensed<br>\
his prayer by gift and acceptance. (TA.) It is<br>\
said in the Kur [ii. 182], أُجِيبُ دَعْوةَ الدَّاعِى إِذَا<br>\
لِى ↓ دَعَانِ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا [I answer the prayer of<br>\
him who prayeth to me;] therefore let them<br>\
answer me; (TA;) i. e., let them answer my call<br>\
by obedience, (Jel,) when I call them to belief<br>\
and obedience: (Bd:) accord. to Fr, what is<br>\
here meant [by the last verb] is تَلْبِيَة [q. v. in<br>\
art. لبى]: (TA:) [or let them give me their<br>\
assent, or consent, to my call; or let them obey<br>\
my call: for you say, اجابهُ إِلَى شَىْءٍ and عَلَى شَىْءٍ,<br>\
(for the latter of which there is authority in this<br>\
art. in the TA, but the former is more common,)<br>\
and] له ↓ استجاب, He obeyed him, or complied<br>\

-b3-  دَمْعٌ يُجِيبُ<br>\

for and answering the call. (Har p. 71.)<br>\
-A2-  The<br>\
forms أَجْوَبَ and أَجْوِبْ [as verbs of wonder] are<br>\
not used: therefore you say, مَا أَجْوَدَ جَوَابَهُ and<br>\
أَجْوِدْ بِجَوَابِهِ [How good is his answer, or reply!];<br>\
not مَا أَجْوَبَهُ nor أَجْوِبْ بِهِ: nor do you say, هُوَ<br>\
أَجْوَبُ مِنْكَ [meaning He is better in answering,<br>\
or replying, than thou: but see أَجْوَبُ, below].<br>\

for answers; they answered one another; replied,<br>\
one to another; held a dialogue, colloquy, conference,<br>\
disputation, or debate, together; bandied words, one<br>\
with another]: (K:) ↓ مُجَاوَبَةٌ and تَجَاوُبٌ both<br>\
signify i. q. تَحَاوُرٌ. (S, TA.) In like manner<br>\
one says of turtle-doves, (A,) of pigeons, of braying camels, and of neighing horses. (TA.) ―<br>\

and the last parts of his speech correspond, or<br>\

-b2-  Said of a cloud, or a collection of<br>\
clouds, It cleared away [so as to leave an open<br>\
space]. (S, Msb.) It is said in a trad., وَانْجَابَ<br>\

clouds became gathered and drawn together, and<br>\
cleared away from the city [so that they became<br>\

-b2-  He dug<br>\

She hollowed out, or excavated, a place to shelter<br>\

جَوْبٌ [an inf. n. (of 1, q. v.,) used in the sense<br>\
of a pass. part. n. Hence,] a tribe is said to be<br>\

had an insane son; and a man said to him, أَيْنَ<br>\
أَمُّكَ, i. e. “ Whither is thy tending? ” to which<br>\
he (thinking that he said, أَيْنَ أُمُّكَ [“ Where is<br>\
thy mother ! ”],) answered, “She is gone to buy<br>\
flour: ” whereupon his father uttered the words<br>\
of this prov. (TA. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\

-A2-  جَابَةُ المِدْرَى<br>\

phrase, إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ الجِيَبةِ [Verily he is good<br>\
in respect of answer or reply or response: or<br>\
here it seems rather to signify, agreeably with<br>\
analogy, the mode, or manner, of answering or<br>\
replying or responding]. (S.)<br>\
جَوَابٌ An answer, a reply, or a response,<br>\
(Msb, TA, *) to a letter, or writing, and to a<br>\
saying, or question; and this is either affirmative<br>\
or negative: (Msb:) [accord. to some, it is only<br>\
after a question or demand; but this is not correct; for it is often a reply to an affirmation:]<br>\
↓ جِيبَةٌ [q. v.] is syn. therewith; (S, K;) and so<br>\
are ↓ جَابَةٌ [q. v.] and ↓ مَجُوبَةٌ: (K:) the pl. of<br>\
جواب is أَجْوِبَةٌ and جَوَابَاتٌ (Msb.) [Hence, in<br>\
grammar, حَرْفُ جَوَابٍ A responsive, or replicative,<br>\

or i. q. طَرِيقَة خَارِقَة [app. a mistranscription for<br>\

either from جُبْتُ الأَرْضَ (K, TA) “ I traversed<br>\
the land,” (TA,) and signifies (tropical:)  More, or most,<br>\
penetrating to the places whence the answer is<br>\
imagined to proceed; (K, TA;) or [it signifies<br>\
more, or most, quick in being answered,] from<br>\
الدَّعْوَةُ ↓ جَابَتِ, of the measure فَعُلَت, [i. e.,<br>\
originally جَوُبَت,] “ the prayer became answered,”<br>\
which, however, is a verb not in use, like as<br>\
فَقِيرٌ and شَدِيدٌ are imagined to be derived from<br>\
فَقُرَ and شَدُدَ: (Z, TA:) or it signifies more, or<br>\
most, quick of answer, [from أَجَابَ,] and is [anomalous, and] similar to أَطْوَعُ [“ more obedient ”],<br>\
from الطَّاعَةُ, [i. e. from أَطَاعَ “ he obeyed,”] (M,<br>\
L, TA,) and to أَعْطَى [“ more, or most, excellent<br>\
in giving,” from أَعْطَى “ he gave ”], and لَوَاقِحَ<br>\
[pl. of لَاقِحَةٌ a “ fecundating ” wind, (in the Kur<br>\
xv. 22,) from أَلْقَحَ “ he, or it, fecundated ”],<br>\
(M, L, K, TA,) and the like; (M, L, TA;) and<br>\
if so, the word is anomalous because a word of<br>\
the measure أَفْعَلُ of this kind is not derived from<br>\
a verb of more than three letters, except in certain<br>\
cases of deviation from the constant course of<br>\
speech: (L, TA:) the meaning is, (tropical:)  What part<br>\
of the night is that [in which prayer most quickly<br>\
penetrates? or] in which prayer is most quick in<br>\
being answered? (Mgh:) or what part of the<br>\
night is that in which God is most quick in<br>\
answering prayer? (L, TA.)<br>\
