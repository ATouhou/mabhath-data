اجتدث He made, or prepared, a جَدَث,<br>\
i. e., a grave, or sepulchre; or did so for himself.<br>\
(S, K, TA.)<br>\
جَدَثٌ A grave; a sepulchre; pl. أَجْدَاثٌ (S,<br>\
Msb, K) and أَجْدُثٌ; (S, K;) of which latter,<br>\
J cites an ex., but in this instance it is the proper<br>\
name of a place. (TA.) It is of the dial. of<br>\
Tihámeh: the people of Nejd say جَدَفٌ: (Msb:)<br>\
or [as some say] the ف in the latter is a substitute<br>\
for the ث in the former; for اجداث is used as a<br>\
pl. by common consent, and اجداف is not used:<br>\
(TA:) but Suh affirms, in the R, that the latter<br>\
pl. is used by Ru-beh. (TA in art. جدف.)<br>\
