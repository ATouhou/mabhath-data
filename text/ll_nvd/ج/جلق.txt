M, K) and جِوَالِقٌ (K) A sack; in Pers. جُوَالْ;<br>\
(MA, PS;) [not so well rendered in the KL by<br>\
خُرْجِينْ, which means a saddle-bag or a pair of<br>\
saddle-bags, like the Arabic خُرْجٌ;] a certain kind<br>\
of وِعَآءِ [or receptacle], (S, M, K,) [for corn &amp;c.,]<br>\
well known: (M, K:) it has a loop, into which<br>\
is inserted a stick, or piece of wood, called شِظَاظٌ,<br>\
(S and K in art. شظ,) this being also inserted into<br>\
the loop of another جوالق, when they are bound<br>\
upon the camel: (K * and TA in that art.:) or it<br>\
has two loops, one of which is inserted into the<br>\
other, (S and K voce قَطَبَ,) [and then the stick<br>\
is put through,] on the occasion of putting it on a<br>\
camel: (TA ibid.:) the word is arabicized; (M,<br>\
TA;) said to be from كواله, (TA,) or كوالك,<br>\
(KL,) but correctly from چواله, which is Pers.:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. is جَوَالِقُ (S, MA, Mgh, K) and<br>\
جَوَالِيقُ, (Sb, S, MA, Mgh, K,) the latter occurring<br>\
in poetry, (TA,) and جُوَالِقَاتٌ (S, K) was sometimes used, (S,) but this is disallowed by Sb. (S,<br>\
M.) The saying [of a rájiz], cited by Th,<br>\
أُحِبُّ مَاوِيَّةَ حُبًّا صَادِقَا<br>\
حُبَّ أَبِى الجُوَالِقِ الجُوَالِقَا<br>\
[I love Máweeyeh with a true love; with the<br>\
love of the owner (lit. father) of the sack for the<br>\
sack;] means that the speaker had a vehement<br>\
love for the food, or wheat, that was in his جوالق.<br>\
(M.) Another says,<br>\
يَا حَبَّذَا مَا فِى الجَوَالِيقِ السُّودْ<br>\
مِنْ خُشْكَنَانِ وَسَوِيقٍ مَقْنُودْ<br>\
[O, lovely is what is in the black sacks, of biscuit<br>\
and meal of parched barley sweetened with sugarcandy !]. (S.)<br>\
