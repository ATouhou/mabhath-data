جَزْمٌ, meaning that neither should be prolonged in<br>\
utterance, and that the last letter in each should<br>\
be without a case-ending, i.e., be quiescent; so<br>\
that one should not say [in prayer] اَللّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ [nor<br>\
السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ, but أَكْبَرْ in the former<br>\
instance, and اللّٰهْ in the latter]: or, accord. to Z,<br>\
that one should not exceed the due bounds in the<br>\
pronunciation of the hemzeh and the medd: (TA:)<br>\
