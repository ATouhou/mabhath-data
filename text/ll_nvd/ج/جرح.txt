جَرَحَهُ, (S, A, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
جَرَحَ, (K, Msb, &amp;c.,)<br>\
inf. n. جَرْحٌ, (S, Msb, &amp;c.,) He wounded him;<br>\
produced an effect, or made an impression, upon<br>\
him with a weapon: (L:) he cut him: (A,<br>\
MF:) or clave, or rent, some part of his body:<br>\
(MF:) syn. كَلَمَهُ: (K:) and ↓ جرّحهُ, (S, K,)<br>\
inf. n. تَجْرِيحٌ, (TA,) signifies the same (K) in<br>\
an intensive sense, or as applying to several<br>\
objects; (S;) or he wounded him much. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, (K,) or جَرَحَهُ بِلِسَانِهِ, (A, Msb,) inf. n. as<br>\
above, (Msb,) [lit. He wounded him with his<br>\
tongue; meaning] (tropical:)  he reviled him, or vilified<br>\
him; (A, K;) he imputed to him a vice, or<br>\
fault, or the like; or spoke against him. (Msb.)<br>\
And جَرَحُوهُ بِأَنْيَاب وَأَضْرَاسٍ [lit. They wounded<br>\
him with dog-teeth and grinders; meaning] (tropical:)  they<br>\
reviled him, or vilified him, and imputed to him<br>\
vices or the like. (A.) And hence, (Msb,) جَرَحَ<br>\
الشِّاهِدَ (A, L, Msb, K) [and ↓ جرّحهُ, as in many<br>\
of the law-books,] said of a judge, (A, L,) or<br>\
other person, (I.,) (tropical:)  He annulled the witness&#39;s<br>\
claim to be legally credible, (L, K,) by happening<br>\
to discover in him a falsehood &amp;c.; (L;) he<br>\
evinced in the witness something that caused his<br>\
testimony to be rejected: (Msb:) he censured the<br>\
witness, and rejected what he said. (L.) And<br>\
جَرَحَ الرَّجُلَ (tropical:)  He invalidated the man&#39;s testimony.<br>\
(L.) And جَرَحَ الشَّهَادَةَ (tropical:)  [He, or it, invalidated<br>\
the testimony; or annulled its claim to be legally<br>\
credible]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also جَرَحَ, and ↓ اجترح,<br>\
(tropical:)  He gained, acquired, or earned; (S, Mgh, K,<br>\
TA;) or applied himself with art and diligence<br>\
to get, obtain, gain, acquire, or earn; (S, K,<br>\
TA;) a thing: (TA:) he worked, or wrought,<br>\
with his hand, and gained, acquired, or earned;<br>\
&amp;c.: (Msb:) from جِرَاحَةٌ. (Mgh.) You say,<br>\
فُلَانٌ يَجْرَحُ لِعِيَالِهِ, and ↓ يَجْتَرِحُ, (tropical:)  Such a one<br>\
[works, and earns sustenance, or] gains, acquires,<br>\
or earns, and collects, for his family, or household. (TA) And بِئْسَ مَا جَرَحَتْ يَدَاكَ, and<br>\
↓ اجْتَرَحَتْ, (tropical:)  Very evil is that which thy hands<br>\
have done, or wrought, or effected: a metaphor<br>\
taken from the signification of “cutting,” or<br>\
“wounding;” (A, TA;) accord. to El-Khafájee,<br>\
a metaphorical meaning conventionally regarded<br>\
as proper. (TA.) السَّيَّآتِ ↓ اجْتَرَحُوا, in the Kur<br>\
[xlv. 20], means (tropical:)  Have committed crimes, sins,<br>\
or evil actions. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  جَرِحَ, aor. as above,<br>\

legally credible should be annulled. (A, TA.)<br>\
And (tropical:)  It (a tradition, or narrative, A, or a thing,<br>\
Msb) deserved to be rejected [as unworthy of<br>\
credit or regard]. (A, Msb.) اِسْتَجْرَحَتْ هٰذِهِ<br>\
الأَحَادِيثُ means (tropical:)  These traditions deserved to be<br>\
rejected on account of their great number and<br>\
the fewness of such as were true: (A:) or, by<br>\
reason of their great number, obliged those who<br>\
were acquainted with them to annul the claim of<br>\
some one or other of their relaters to be credited,<br>\
and to reject his relation: (L:) or were corrupt:<br>\
(T, S, * TA:) [for] اِسْتِجْرَاحٌ signifies [also] the<br>\
being faulty, defective, and corrupt. (S, K.)<br>\
One says, قَدْ وَعَظْتُكُمْ فَلَمْ تَزْدَادُوا إِلَّا اسْتِجْرَاحًا:<br>\
(S, A:) these words are from a خُطْبَة of ‘AbdEl-Melik; and the meaning is, [I have admonished you and ye have not increased save] in<br>\
corrupt conduct: or in what gaineth for you<br>\
censure. (TA.)<br>\
جَرْحٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
جُرْحٌ a subst. from جَرَحَ; (S, L, K;) A wound;<br>\
(L;) and so ↓ جَرْحٌ, in its original acceptation;<br>\
but some of those skilled in the science of lexicology say that the former is employed to denote the<br>\
effect produced upon bodies by iron instruments<br>\
and the like; and the latter, that produced upon<br>\
objects of the mind by the tongue: (MF:) the<br>\
pl. of the former is جُرُوحٌ and أَجْرَاحٌ [which is a<br>\
pl. of pauc.] (S, L, K) and جِرَاحٌ; (T, A, L;)<br>\
but the second of these is of rare occurrence, (K,)<br>\
only used in poetry: (S, L:) [respecting the<br>\
third, see what follows:] ↓ جِرَاحَةٌ also signifies<br>\
the same as جُرْحٌ; (Msb;) and its pl. is جِرَاحٌ<br>\
(S, Msb, K) and جِرَاحَاتٌ (A, Msb) and جَرَائِحُ;<br>\
(A;) or جِرَاحٌ is a coll. gen. n., of which جِرَاحَةٌ<br>\
is the n. un.; or, accord. to Az, this last has not<br>\
a sing. sense, as Lth asserts it to have, but is a<br>\
pl. of جُرْحٌ, like as حِجَارَةٌ is of حَجَرٌ, and جِمَالَةٌ<br>\
of جَمَلٌ, and حِبَالَةٌ of حَبْلٌ. (L.)<br>\
جُرْحَةٌ (tropical:)  A thing whereby testimony is invalidated, or its claim to be legally credible annulled:<br>\
as in the saying, هَلْ لَكَ جُرْحَةٌ (tropical:)  [Hast thou anything to adduce whereby to invalidate the testimony?]. (A, TA.) أَقْصَصْتُكَ الجُرْحَةَ فَإِنْ كَانَ<br>\
عِنْدَكَ مَا تَجْرَحُ بِهِ الحُجَّةَ فَهَلُمَّهَا, said by the judge<br>\
of El-Medeeneh to one of the parties in a lawsuit, when about to give judgment against him,<br>\
means (tropical:)  I authorize thee to adduce anything<br>\
whereby to invalidate the testimony: [therefore,<br>\
if thou have anything whereby thou mayest invalidate the allegation, adduce it.] (A, * TA.)<br>\
جَرِيحٌ; pl. جَرْحَى; (S, A, Msb, K;) each of<br>\
which is mase. and fem.; (S, K;) Wounded.<br>\
(Msb.) The pl. is not formed by the addition of<br>\
و and ن because the fem. is not formed by the<br>\
addition of ة. (TA.)<br>\
جِرَاحَةٌ: see جُرْحٌ.<br>\
جَرَائِحِىٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
جَرَّاحٌ A surgeon that dresses wounds. (Golius<br>\
on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof; and so in the<br>\
present day; as also ↓ جَرَائِحِىٌّ.)<br>\
جَارِحَةٌ sing. of جَوَارِحُ. (Mgh, L, Msb, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  The latter signifies (tropical:)  Beasts, and birds, of<br>\
prey; or that catch game; (S, A, * Mgh, L, Msb,<br>\
K:) thus the falcon is a جارحة, and so is the<br>\
dog trained for hunting, because it gains for its<br>\
owner: (L:) and this appellation is applied alike<br>\
to the male and the female, like رَاحِلَةٌ and رَاوِيَةٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  The members, or limbs, of a<br>\
man, with which things are gained or earned;<br>\
(S, K, TA;) or with which one works; (A;) as<br>\
the hands or arms, and the feet or legs: (S,<br>\
A, K, TA:) because they gain, or earn, or do,<br>\
good and evil. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And (tropical:)  The organs<br>\
of the body: thus, for instance, جارحة is<br>\
applied (in the Msb, art. بصر,) to the eye, which<br>\
is termed (in the TA in that art.) the seeing<br>\
جارحة (الجَارِحَةُ النَّاظِرَةُ).] ―<br>\
-b5-  Also (assumed tropical:)  Mares:<br>\
[and the like:] because they bring gain to their<br>\
owners by their breeding. (AA, T.) You say,<br>\
مَا لَهُ جَارِحَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  He possesses not a female beast that<br>\
bears young: he possesses not that which makes<br>\
gain. (TA.) And هٰذِهِ النَّاقَةُ مِنْ جَوَارِحِ المَالِ,<br>\
and هذه الأَتَانُ, (K,) and هذه الفَرَسُ, (TA,)<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  This she-camel, and this she-ass, and this mare,<br>\
is young, unimpaired by age (مُقْبِلَةٌ [i. q. مُقْتَبَلَةٌ])<br>\
in the womb, (K, TA,) and in youthful vigour,<br>\
and one of which the offspring is wished for.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
