جَبَهَهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
جَبَهَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n.<br>\
جَبْهٌ, (Ham p. 355,) He slapped, (S,) or struck,<br>\
(K,) or hit, (Msb,) or struck him on, (Ham ubi<br>\
suprà,) his جَبْهَة [or forehead]. (S, Msb, K, and<br>\
Ham ubi suprà.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence], (K,) aor. and<br>\
inf. n. as above, (TA,) (tropical:)  He turned him back (K,<br>\
TA) from the thing that he wanted: (TA:) or<br>\
(tropical:)  he met him, or encountered him, with, or he said<br>\
to him, or did to him, a thing disliked, or hated:<br>\
(K, TA, TK:) or (tropical:)  he encountered him, or confronted him, with speech in which was roughness:<br>\
(JK, M, TA:) or (tropical:)  he encountered him with that<br>\
which he disliked, or hated; or he accused him<br>\
thereof to his face; (M, TA, and Ham ubi<br>\
suprà;) or so جَبَهَهُ بِالمَكْرُوهِ. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  جَبَهَ المَآءَ,<br>\
(JK, S, K,) inf. n. as above, (JK, S,) (tropical:)  He came<br>\
to the water, (JK, S, K,) when there was at it no<br>\
apparatus for drawing, (S,) i. e. no pulley &amp;c.,<br>\
(JK, TA,) or having no means of drawing, so<br>\
that he only looked at the surface of the water.<br>\
(Z, K.) [See also جَبِيهَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b4-  جَبَهَ القَوْمَ (tropical:)  It (winter) came upon the people unprepared for it.<br>\

تَجْبِيهٌ The mounting a fornicator, or an<br>\
adulterer, upon an ass, and turning his face<br>\
towards the tail; whence the trad. of the Jews<br>\
respecting the adulterer, يُحُمَّمُ وَيُجَبَّهُ ويُجْلَدُ<br>\
[He shall have his face blackened with charcoal,<br>\
and be mounted on an ass with his face towards<br>\
the tail, and be flogged]: (Mgh:) or the mounting<br>\
two fornicators, or adulterers, upon an ass, and<br>\
turning the backs of their heads towards each<br>\
other, (JK, Mgh,) and parading them round<br>\
about; thus accord. to the Tekmileh: (Mgh:)<br>\
or the blackening [with charcoal] the faces of two<br>\
fornicators, or adulterers, (أَنْ يُحَمَّرَ in the K<br>\
being a mistake for أَنْ يُحُمَّمَ, i. e. يُسَوَّدَ, TA,)<br>\
and mounting them upon a camel or an ass, and<br>\
turning their faces in contrary directions: accord.<br>\
to analogy, it should mean turning their faces<br>\
towards each other; for it is from الجَبْتَةُ: تَجْبِيهٌ<br>\
also signifies the bending, inclining, lowering, or<br>\
hanging down, the head towards the ground: and<br>\
it may be hence; (i. e. it may be hence that it is<br>\
applied to him who is mounted on a beast in the<br>\
manner described above; TA;) because he to<br>\
whom this is done bends down his head in shame<br>\
and confusion: or it may be from جَبَهَهُ meaning<br>\
&quot;he did to him a thing disliked, or hated.&quot; (K.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِجْتِبَاهٌ The deeming [one] rude, coarse, unkind, hard, or churlish. (JK.) ―<br>\

namely, a country, or town, and a man. (JK.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  He disapproved it, or disliked it, and did not<br>\
find it wholesome; namely, water, (En-Nawádir,<br>\
K,) &amp;c. (K.)<br>\
جَبَهٌ Largeness, (S,) or width (JK, M, K) and<br>\
beauty, (M, K,) of the جَبْهَة [or forehead]: (JK,<br>\
S, M, K:) or protuberance, or prominence, thereof.<br>\
(M, K.)<br>\
جَبْهَةٌ [The forehead;] the part of the face<br>\
which is the place of prostration: (As, Msb, K:)<br>\
or the even part that is between the eyebrows and<br>\
the نَاصِيَة [or place where the hair grows in the<br>\
fore part of the head]: (Kh, JK, Msb, K:) so<br>\
of a man, (S, Msb,) and of others: (S:) [or,] of<br>\
a horse, the part that is below the ears and above<br>\
the eyes: (TA:) pl. جِبَاهٌ. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
الجَبْهَةُ (assumed tropical:)  A certain Mansion of the Moon; [the<br>\
Tenth Mansion;] (S, K, Kzw;) consisting of<br>\
four stars; (S;) the four stars [ζ, γ, η, and α,]<br>\
in the neck and heart of Leo; [regarded by the<br>\
Arabs as the fore-part, or forehead, of Leo;]<br>\
(Kzw in his descr. of Leo;) between each of<br>\
which and the next to it is the space of a whip&#39;s<br>\
length; the northernmost of them called by astrologers الأَسَدُ. (Kzw in his descr. of the Mansions<br>\
of the Moon.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The moon (K, TA)<br>\
itself: but [it rather seems to mean the upper<br>\
part of the disc of the moon; for] it is said in<br>\
the M that a certain unknown poet has metaphorically assigned a جبهة to the moon. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Also جَبْهَةٌ, (tropical:)  The chief of a people, or company of men; (JK, Mgh, K, TA;) like as one<br>\
says the وَجْه thereof. (Mgh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (tropical:)  The<br>\
generous and manly, or manly and noble, persons<br>\
of a people, or company of men: or men exerting<br>\
themselves in the case of a bloodwit or a debt or<br>\
other obligation, (K, TA,) or in repairing the<br>\
condition of a poor man, (TA,) and who come<br>\
not to any one but he is ashamed to turn them<br>\
back, (K, TA,) or who are seldom or never<br>\
turned back by anyone: so, accord. to Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, in a trad. in which it is said that there<br>\
shall be no poor-rate in the case of the جبهة.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  (tropical:)  A company, or collected number, of<br>\
men, (JK, S, Msb,) and of horses: (JK, Msb:)<br>\
or, of horses, the best: (TA:) and [simply]<br>\
horses; (Lth, S, M, Mgh, K;) a word having no<br>\
sing., or n. un.: (M, K:) accord. to Lth, (TA,)<br>\
having this last meaning in the trad. above mentioned; (S, Mgh, TA;) because horses are the<br>\
best of beasts. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  (tropical:)  Abjectness, or ignominy; (JK, M, K, TA;) and a state of annoyance, or molestation: (Z, TA:) thought by ISd<br>\
to be from جَبَهَهُ meaning “ he encountered him<br>\
with that which he disliked or hated,” or “ he<br>\
accused him thereof to his face; ” because the<br>\
doing this causes one to experience abjectness, or<br>\
ignominy. (TA.) It is said to have this meaning<br>\
in a trad., in which it is said, فَإِنَّ اللّٰهَ قَدْ أَرَاحَكُمْ<br>\
مِنَ الجَبْهَةِ والسَّجَّةِ والبَجَّةِ, i. e. For God hath<br>\
relieved you from abjectness, or ignominy, &amp;c.,<br>\
and milk diluted with water, and blood drawn<br>\
from a vein [of a camel], which the Arabs used<br>\
to eat: or in this trad., (TA,) الجَبْتَهَةُ is the name<br>\
of a certain idol (ISd, K, TA) that was worshipped in the Time of Ignorance: (TA:) and<br>\
السجّة and البجّة were two idols. (S and K in<br>\
art. سج.)<br>\
وَرَدْنَا مَآءً لَهُ جَبِيهَةٌ We came to a water that<br>\
was salt, so that the drinking thereof did not<br>\
take away the thirst of our cattle: (ISk, JK, S:)<br>\
or that was altered for the worse in taste and<br>\
colour, from some such cause as long standing,<br>\
though still drinkable; or covered with the green<br>\
substance called طُحْلُب and with leaves: or that<br>\
was deep in the bottom, difficult to give to drink.<br>\
(ISk, S.) [See also 1, last meaning but one.]<br>\
جُبَّهٌ i. q. جُبَّأٌ, (K,) i. e. A fearful, or cowardly,<br>\
man. (TA.)<br>\
جَابِهٌ, applied to a gazelle, (JK,) or to a bird<br>\
or a wild animal, (K,) That meets one with its<br>\
face or forehead; and such is of evil omen: (K:)<br>\
contr. of قَعِيدٌ. (JK.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Coming to water: so<br>\
in a saying cited and explained in art. اذن,<br>\
conj. 2. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
أَجْبَهُ, applied to a man, Large, (S,) or wide<br>\
(JK, M, K) and beautiful, (M, K,) in the جَبْهَة<br>\
[or forehead]: (JK, S, M, K:) or protuberant,<br>\
or prominent, therein: (M, K:) applied to a<br>\
horse, having a protuberant, or prominent, forehead, rising beyond the bone of the nose: (TA:)<br>\
fem. جَبْهَآءُ; (S, K;) of which the dim. is جُبَيْهَآءُ.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الأَجْبَهُ The lion; (K;) because of the<br>\
width of his جَبْهَة. (TA.)<br>\
جبو and جبى<br>\
[The words belonging to the former of these<br>\
two arts. cannot well be classed by themselves,<br>\
being intimately connected with those of the latter,<br>\
which are the more numerous and common, and<br>\
from which they are generally easily distinguishable.]<br>\
1<br>\
جَبَى, (K,) first pers. جَبَيْتُ, (Ks, S, Er-Rághib,) aor.<br>\
1َ2ِ3َ; (K;) and جَبَى, aor.<br>\
1َ2َ3َ, (K,)<br>\
said by MF to be unknown, and also, because<br>\
neither the second nor the third radical is a faucial<br>\
letter, unreasonable, but mentioned by Sb, though<br>\
held by him to be of weak authority, and mentioned also by IAar, as extr., like أَبَى, aor. يَأْبَى;<br>\
(TA;) and جَبَا, (TA,) first pers. جَبَوْتُ, (Ks, S,<br>\
TA,) aor.<br>\
1َ2ُ3َ; (TA;) inf. n. [of the first and<br>\
second] جَبْىٌ (Sh, K) and [probably of the last<br>\
only] جَبًا and جِبًا and جُبًا and [of the last, but<br>\
whether in the first or the second of the senses<br>\
here following is not shown,] جِبْوَةٌ; (K; [or this<br>\
last has a different application, explained below;])<br>\
He collected water in a trough or tank for beasts<br>\
&amp;c. [Ks, S, K, Er-Rághib.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And (hence,<br>\
metaphorically, Er-Rághib, TA) the first of these<br>\
verbs, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, Er-Rághib,) and the<br>\
second, (K,) and the third; (S, Msb, TA;) inf. n.<br>\
(of the first, S, Msb) جِبَايَةٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, Er-Rághib) and (of the last, S, Msb) جِبَاوَةٌ (S, Msb,<br>\
K) and جَبْوٌ (TA) [and probably جِبْوَةٌ also, which<br>\
see above]; (tropical:)  He collected the [tax called] خَرَاج,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K, Er-Rághib,) and [other] property. (Msb, TA.) The last of these verbs is<br>\
said in the S to be originally with ء, though pronounced without ء; but IB says that this is not<br>\
the case, and that it has not been heard with ء.<br>\
(TA.) You say also, جَبَاهُ القَوْمَ (assumed tropical:)  [He collected<br>\
it from the people, or company of men]; (M, K, *<br>\
TA;) and جَبَى مِنْهُمْ (assumed tropical:)  [He collected from them].<br>\
(M, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also جَبَا [or جَبَى], (TA,) first pers.<br>\
جَبَيْتُ, (Zj, TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He appropriated a thing<br>\
purely to himself, exclusively of any partner;<br>\
chose it, or took it in preference, for himself.<br>\
(Zj, TA.) And hence, (Zj, TA,) ↓ اجتباهُ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
chose it, or selected it, (Zj, S, K) لِنَفْسِهِ for himself. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And جَبَى and جَبَا, [originally<br>\
جَبَأَ,] He returned, receded, retreated, or went<br>\
back. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
جبّى, inf. n. تَجْبِيَةٌ, He placed his hands<br>\
upon his knees, (K, TA,) in prayer; (TA;) or<br>\
upon the ground: or he fell prostrate; or fell<br>\
upon his face: (K:) or he lowered his body and<br>\
his hands, and raised his buttocks: (Ham p. 801:)<br>\
[or] تجبية signifies a man&#39;s standing [with the<br>\
hands upon the knees] in the manner of the رَاكِع:<br>\
(S, K: *) accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, what is thus termed<br>\
is of two kinds: one is the placing the hands<br>\
upon the knees, while standing: the other, the<br>\
prostrating oneself, or falling upon the face, lying<br>\
down; which is سُجُودٌ: (S:) or the bending<br>\
down, and placing the hands upon the knees;<br>\
because it is a bringing-together of the limbs.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  جبّاهُ, inf. n. as above, meaning He<br>\
gave to him, is vulgar. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اجبى in the trad. مَنْ أَجْبَى فَقَدْ أَرْبَى is<br>\
originally أَجْبَأَ [q. v.]: (S:) accord. to IAth,<br>\
it is a corruption of the relater, or the ء is suppressed to assimilate the verb to اربى (TA.)<br>\
The inf. n., إِجْبَآءٌ, is variously explained, as<br>\
follows: (TA:) The selling seed-produce before<br>\
it shows itself to be in a good state: (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
Th, S, K:) and a man&#39;s hiding his camels from<br>\
the collector of the poor-rate: (IAar, A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
K:) and i. q. عِينَةٌ; i. e. the selling to a man<br>\
a commodity for a certain price to be paid at<br>\
a certain period, then buying it of him with<br>\
ready money for a less price than that for which<br>\
it was sold. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِجْتِبَآءٌ (assumed tropical:)  The drawing forth property from<br>\
the places in which it is known, or presumed, or<br>\

-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  The collecting in<br>\
the way of choice, or selection. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\

-b3-  See also 1, last sentence but one. ―<br>\
-b4-  Also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  God&#39;s particular, or peculiar, distinguishing of<br>\
men by abundant bounty, from which various<br>\
blessings result to them without their labour; as<br>\
happens to prophets and some others. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also اجتباهُ, (assumed tropical:)  He forged it:<br>\
and he extemporized it. (TA.) Hence, in the<br>\
Kur [vii. 202], قَالُوا لَوْلَا اجْتَبَيْتَهَا (assumed tropical:)  They say,<br>\
Wherefore hast thou not forged it, (Fr, TA,) or<br>\
produced it, (Th, TA,) or invented it, (Jel,) or<br>\
put it together by forgery, (Bd,) of thyself?<br>\
(Fr, Th, Bd, Jel, TA:) or wherefore hast thou<br>\
not sought it, or demanded it, of God? (Bd.)<br>\
جَبًا, or جَبًى, (as in different copies of the K,)<br>\
written with ا and with ى, (TA,) The camel-waterer&#39;s going in advance of the camels a day<br>\
before their coming to the water, and collecting<br>\
for them water in the drinking-trough, and then<br>\
bringing them to it (IAar, K, TA) on the morrow.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) [App. an inf. n., of which, in this<br>\
sense, the verb is not mentioned.] So in the<br>\
verse,<br>\
بِالرَّيْثِ مَا أَرْوَيْتُهَا لَا بِالعَجَلْ<br>\
وَبِالجَبَا أَرْوَيْتُهَا لَا بِالقَبَلْ<br>\
[Slowly I satisfied their thirst; not hastily: and<br>\
by going in advance of them a day, and collecting<br>\
for them water in the trough, and bringing them<br>\
to it on the morrow, I satisfied their thirst; not<br>\
by pouring the water into the trough while they<br>\
were drinking, without having prepared any for<br>\
them beforehand]. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also the former,<br>\
Water collected [in a trough]; and so ↓ جُبْوَةٌ,<br>\
with damm. (TA. [See جِبًا.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  A wateringtrough (K, TA) in which water is collected:<br>\
(TA:) or the station of the drawer of water,<br>\
upon the [upper part of the] casing. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The<br>\
place where a well is dug: (K:) in this sense,<br>\
and in the next, also written جَبًى (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The<br>\
brink, or margin, of a well. (A boo-Leylà, K.)<br>\
The earth that is around a well, that is seen from<br>\
afar; (S;) originally جَبَأٌ: (TA:) what is around<br>\
a well: (K:) and what is around a wateringtrough: (TA:) pl. أَجْبَآءٌ. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  جَبَا meaning<br>\
A gift without compensation is a vulgar word.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
جِبًا Water collected (T, S, K) in a trough, (T,<br>\
K,) being drawn from a well, (T, TA,) for<br>\
camels; (S;) [like جَبًا;] as also ↓ جِبْوَةٌ, (K, TA,<br>\
and so in a copy of the S, but omitted in the CK,)<br>\
or ↓ جَبْوَةٌ, (so in two copies of the S,) and ↓ جُبْوَةٌ<br>\
also, (so in a copy of the S, [see جَبًا,]) and ↓ جَبَاوَةٌ,<br>\
(K, TA, and so in a copy of the S,) and ↓ جَبَاوَةٌ,<br>\
(K, TA, and so in another copy of the S, but<br>\
omitted in the CK,) and ↓ جِبَآءَةٌ: (TA as from<br>\
the K, but not in the CK: [perhaps a mistranscription for ↓ جِبَايَةٌ:]) but accord. to IAmb, جِبًا<br>\
is pl. of ↓ جِبْيَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
جَبْوَةٌ; see جِبًا.<br>\
جُبْوَةٌ: see جَبًا and جِبًا.<br>\
جِبْوَةٌ: see جِبًا.<br>\
-A2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A mode, or manner,<br>\
of collecting the [tax called] خَرَاج; and so ↓ جِبْيَةٌ,<br>\
which Lh calls an inf. n. (TA.)<br>\
جِبْيَةٌ: see what next precedes: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see جِبًا.<br>\
جِبَآءَةٌ: see جِبًا.<br>\
جَبَاوَةٌ and جِبَاوَةٌ: see جِبًا.<br>\
جِبَايَةٌ: see جِبًا. ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  The tax called إِتَاوَة [or خَرَاج].<br>\
(TA in art. اتو.) [Originally an inf. n.]<br>\
جَبَايَا [a pl. of which the sing. is not mentioned]<br>\
Wells which are dug, and in which the shoots of<br>\
grape-vines are set. (AHn, K.)<br>\
جَابٍ A collector of water for camels: belonging<br>\
to arts. جبو and جبى. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  The locust<br>\
(K) that collects everything by eating it; as also<br>\
جَابِىءٌ [q. v.]. (TA.) The Arabs say, إِذَا جَآءَتِ<br>\
السَّنَةُ جَآءَ مَعَهَا الجَابِى وَالجَانِى, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [When the<br>\
year of drought comes,] the locust and the wolf<br>\
[come with it]. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
جَابِيَةٌ A watering-trough, (S,) or large wateringtrough, (K,) in which water is collected (S) for<br>\
camels: (TA:) or a watering-trough that collects<br>\
water: (Er-Rághib, TA:) pl. جَوَابٍ. (S.) Hence,<br>\
in the Kur [xxxiv. 12], وَجَفَانٍ كَالجَوَابِى [And<br>\
bowls like watering-troughs, or great wateringtroughs]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A company of men. (K, *<br>\
