the locust, يَجْدِى كُلَّ شَىْءٍ, meaning It eats<br>\
everything. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  لَمْ أَجْدِ مِنْ ذٰلِكَ بُدًّا I<br>\
found no means of avoiding, or escaping, that,<br>\
is sometimes said for لَمْ أَجِدْ الخ??. (Kz, TA in<br>\

جدّى الرَّحْلِ, inf. n. تَجْدِيَةٌ, He made, or<br>\

جَدْىBٌ A kid: (S:) or a male kid; (IAmb,<br>\
Msb, K;) the female being called عَنَاقٌ: (IAmb,<br>\
Msb:) or a kid in his first year; (Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
not yet a year old: (TA:) one should not say<br>\
جِدْىBٌ; (S;) this being a bad dial. var.: (Msb:)<br>\
pl. (of pauc., TA, applied to three, S) أَجْدٍ (S,<br>\
Msb, K) and (of mult., TA, applied to more<br>\
than three, S) جِدَآءٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and جِدْيَانٌ:<br>\
(K:) جَدَايَا [as pl. of جَدْى] is not allowable.<br>\

[the star a of Ursa Minor, commonly called<br>\
the pole-star,] that revolves with بَنَاتُ نَعْشٍ, (K,)<br>\

kibleh is known, (S,) or according to which the<br>\
kibleh is turned; (Msb;) the bright star at the<br>\
extremity of the tail of the Lesser Bear; (Kzw;)<br>\
the star of the kibleh; (Mgh;) also called جَدْىBُ<br>\
الفَرْقَدِ; (Mgh, Msb;) and called by the astronomers ↓ الجُدَىُّ, in the dim. form, to distinguish<br>\
it from what next follows. (Mgh, MF.) [See<br>\
also القُطْبُ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence also, (M, TA,) A certain<br>\
sign of the Zodiac; (S, K;) [namely, Capricornus;] the tenth of the signs of the Zodiac;<br>\
(Mgh;) that next to the دَلْو; unknown to the<br>\
Arabs [of the classical times]. (K.) This and<br>\
the former together are called [the] جَدْيَانِ.<br>\

(الدَّفَّتَانِ) of a horse&#39;s and of a camel&#39;s saddle;<br>\
[one on either side; for] there are two of such<br>\
stuffed things: (S:) the pl. of the former is<br>\
جَدَيَاتٌ, (Sb, S,) which may be used as a pl. of<br>\
mult., (TA,) or جَدْيَاتٌ, so in [some of] the<br>\
copies of the K, [but omitted in the CK and in<br>\
my MS. copy of the K,] following the TS, as on<br>\
the authority of A&#39;Obeyd and AA and En-Nadr,<br>\
(TA,) and ↓ جَدْىBٌ; (S, IB, [in some copies of<br>\
the S جَدًا, but the former (which I find in two<br>\
copies of the S) is said by IB to be the right;<br>\
or rather this is a coll. gen. n.,]) like as شَرْىBٌ is<br>\
of شَرْيَةٌ: (IB, TA:) the pl. of ↓ جَدِيَّةٌ is جَدَايَا.<br>\
(S.) [See also جَدِيدَةٌ, and رِفَادَةٌ.]<br>\

when it has attained the age of six months, or<br>\
seven, and has run, and become strong: or, as<br>\
some say, the male thereof: pl. جَدَايَا. (M, TA.)<br>\

meaning He is keeping to his own side: he is<br>\
following his own course; like the phrase هُوَ عَلَى<br>\
طَرِيقَتِهِ: or he is by himself; like هُوَ عَلَى وَحْدِهِ<br>\
and حِدَتِهِ]. (TA.)<br>\
جَادٍ The locust; because it eats (يَجْدِى, i. e.<br>\
يَأْكُلُ) everything: but the appellation [more]<br>\
commonly known is جَابِئُ. (TA.)<br>\
جَادِىٌّ [erroneously written in the CK, in this<br>\
art. and in art. جود, without the sheddeh to the<br>\
