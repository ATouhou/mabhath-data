جَدَفَهُ, aor.<br>\
جَدِفَ, (IDrd, K,) inf. n. جَدْفٌ,<br>\
(TA,) He cut it; or cut it off: (IDrd, K:) and<br>\
so جَذَفَهُ. (TA.)<br>\

جَدِفَ,<br>\
(Ks, IDrd, S,) inf. n. جُدُوفٌ, (Ks, S, K,) or جَدْفٌ,<br>\
(L as on the authority of Ks,) He (a bird) flew<br>\
[with his wings] clipped, appearing as though he<br>\
turned his wings backward: (Ks, S, K:) or contracted his wing somewhat, in order to descend in<br>\
his flight, and then inclined, or declined, in fear<br>\
of the hawk: (TA:) and he (a bird) went quickly,<br>\
(K in art. جذف,) with his wings; generally when<br>\
one of the wings had been shortened; (TA;) as<br>\
also ↓ اجدف and ↓ انجدف: and so, all, with ذ.<br>\
(K ib.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] جَدَفَ المَلَّاحُ بِالمِجْدَافِ [The<br>\
sailor rowed, or paddled, with the oar, or paddle].<br>\

السَّفِينَةَ, aor.<br>\
جَدِفَ, inf. n. جَدْفٌ, (Mgh,) [He rowed,<br>\
or paddled, the ship, or boat;] he put the ship, or<br>\
boat, in motion with the مِجْدَف [or مِجْدَاف].<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also جَدَفَ He (a man) swung the<br>\
arms; (K, expl. by ضَرَبَ بِاليَدَيْنِ; in the O, بِاليَدِ,<br>\
as is said in the TA;) as a man does in walking,<br>\
moving them about: and the meaning seems to<br>\
be, he walked quickly: (TA:) you say, جَدَفَ فِى<br>\
مِشْيَتِهِ he (a man) was quick in his manner of<br>\
walking; (AAF, TA;) and so with ذ: (S in art.<br>\
جذف:) or جَدْفٌ signifies a repeated interrupting<br>\
of the voice (تَقْطِيعُ الصَّوْتِ) in singing to camels<br>\
to urge or excite them. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. جَدْفٌ, (TA,) He (a gazelle) went, or<br>\
walked, with short steps. (K, * TA.) And جَدَفَتْ<br>\
She (a woman) walked like those that are short:<br>\
and she (a gazelle, and a woman, TA) went with<br>\
short steps; as also ↓ اجدفت: and so, both, with ذ.<br>\
(K in art. جذف.) ―<br>\
-b5-  جَدَفَتِ السَّمَآءُ بِالثَّلْجِ The<br>\

جدّف, (S,) inf. n. تَجْدِيفٌ, (S, K,) He<br>\
denied, or disacknowledged, favours, or benefits;<br>\
or was ungrateful, or unthankful, for them: (As,<br>\
S, K:) or he deemed the gifts of God small: (ElUmawee, S, K:) or he said that he was in an evil<br>\
state when he was in a good state: (TA:) or he said,<br>\
لَيْسَ لِى وَلَيْسَ عِنْدِى [app. meaning There is nothing due to me nor by me]; (K;) thus explained<br>\
by Mohammad on his saying that the worst of<br>\
deeds is التَّجْدِيف: (TA:) [accord. to Golius,<br>\
he blasphemed; and identified by him, in this<br>\
sense, with the Hebr. ?.] It is said in a trad.,<br>\
لَا تُجَدِّفُوا بِنِعْمَةِ اللّٰهِ (S, TA) Deny not ye, or disacknowledge not, or be not ungrateful or unthankful for, the bounty of God, and deem it not<br>\

إِنْجَدَفَ see 1.<br>\
جَدَفٌ A grave; a sepulchre; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
like جَدَثٌ; for the Arabs made ف and ث interchangeable: (Fr, S:) the former is of the dial. of<br>\
Nejd; and the latter, of the dial. of Tihámeh:<br>\
(Msb in art. جدث:) [accord. to some,] the<br>\
former is formed from the latter by substitution<br>\
[of ف for ث]: (S:) IJ argues that this is the<br>\
case because the former has not أَجْدَافٌ for pl.:<br>\
(TA:) but it has this pl., (Fr, S, R, TA,) used<br>\
by Ru-beh. (R, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, said in a trad. to<br>\
be the beverage of the jinn, or genii, (S, TA,)<br>\

↓ لَمَجْدُوفٌ. (TA.)<br>\
مِجْدَافٌ The wing of a bird: (S, Msb, K:)<br>\
sometimes with ذ. (Msb.) ―<br>\

↓ مِجْدَفٌ [signifies the same;] a certain thing<br>\
with which a ship, or boat, is put in motion:<br>\
(Mgh:) pl. مَجَادِيفُ: (Msb:) from جَدَفَ said<br>\
of a bird: (As, S, M:) also called مِجْذَافٌ (IDrd,<br>\
S, Msb) and مِقْذَفٌ and مِقْذَافٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
