جَدَعَ الأَنْفَ, (S, * Msb, K, *) aor.<br>\
جَدَعَ, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. جَدْعٌ, (S, Msb, K,) He cut off the nose;<br>\
and in like manner, the ear; and the hand, or<br>\
arm; and the lip; (S, Msb, K;) and a similar<br>\
part: (TA:) and أَنْفَهُ ↓ أَجْدَعْتُ signifies the same<br>\
as جَدَعْتُ [I cut off his nose]: or جَدْعٌ signifies<br>\
[absolutely] the cutting off; or cutting so as to<br>\
separate. (TA.) In the following saying of a<br>\
poet, the verb is used metaphorically,<br>\
وَأَصْبَحَ الدَّهْرُ ذُو العِرْنِينِ قَدْ جُدِعَا<br>\
[lit. And nosed fortune became mutilated in the<br>\
nose; meaning, (assumed tropical:) became marred]. (TA.) And in<br>\
the following phrase, occurring in a verse, كَأَنَّ اللّٰهَ<br>\
يَجْدَعُ أَنْفَهُ وَعَيْنَيْهِ, the poet means, [As though<br>\
God cut off his nose] and put out his eyes: see a<br>\
similar saying in art. قلد, voce تَقَلَّدَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
جَدَعَهُ, (S, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,)<br>\
He mutilated him, or maimed him, by cutting off<br>\
his nose, or his ear, or his hand or arm, or his lip,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) or the like; (TA;) as also ↓ جدّعهُ<br>\
(S, TA.) [Hence the phrase,] لَهُ ↓ جَدْعًا (S, K)<br>\
[(May God decree) to him mutilation, or maining, by the cutting off of his nose, or the like; or<br>\
cause it to befall him: or] meaning أَلْزَمَهُ اللّٰهُ الجَدْعَ<br>\
[(assumed tropical:) may God make injury, or diminution of what<br>\
is good, to cleave to him]: (K:) said in imprecating a curse upon a man: similar to عَقْرًا لَهُ,<br>\
q. v.: the first word being governed in the accus.<br>\
case by a verb understood. (TA.) One says also,<br>\
اِجْدَعْهُمْ بِالأَمْرِ حَتَّى يَذِلُّوا, a phrase mentioned by<br>\
IAar, but not explained by him; thought by ISd<br>\
to mean, (tropical:) Act thou, in commanding, as though<br>\
thou mutilatedst them by cutting off their noses<br>\
[until they become submissive]. (TA.) In the<br>\
phrase ↓ صَوْتُ الحِمَارِ اليُجَدَّعُ [The voice of the<br>\
ass that has his ear, or ears, cut off, (see مُجَدَّعٌ,<br>\
below,)], occurring in a verse of Dhu-l-Khirak<br>\
Et-Tuhawee, (S,) accord. to J, but not found by<br>\
Sgh in the verses of that poet, and said to be in<br>\
the Book [of Sb], though IB denies this, asserting<br>\
it to be in the Nawádir of AZ, (TA,) Akh says,<br>\
the poet means الَّذِى يُجَدَّعُ, like as you say,<br>\
هُوَالْيَضْرِبُكَ, meaning الَّذِى يَضْرِبُكَ: Aboo-Bekr<br>\
Ibn-es-Sarráj says, the poet, requiring refa for the<br>\
rhyme, has changed the noun into a verb; and<br>\
this is one of the worst of poetic licences. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,] السَّنَةُ تَجْدَعُ النَّبَاتَ (tropical:) [The year of<br>\
drought cuts off, or destroys, the herbage]: (A,<br>\
