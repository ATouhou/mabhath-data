advice, people seek relief, like as the mangy<br>\
camels seek relief from their mange by rubbing<br>\
themselves against the post above mentioned,<br>\

defend me: (TA in art. رجب:) the dim. is here<br>\
used for the purpose of aggrandizement. (K.<br>\
[See also art. حك.]) And hence, (TA,) هُوَ جِذْلُ<br>\

engaged in contending for stakes, or wagers;<br>\
رهان being here an inf. n. of رَاهَنَ; not a pl. of<br>\
