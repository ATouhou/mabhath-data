جَبَأَ and<br>\
جَبِئَ, aor.<br>\
جَبَاَ, He restrained, or<br>\
withheld, himself; refrained, forbore, or abstained; or turned back, or reverted. (K, TA.)<br>\
You say, جَبَأَ عَنْهُ, and جَبِئَ, meaning He restrained, or withheld, himself, &amp;c., from him, or<br>\
it; and regarded him, or it, with reverence, veneration, dread, awe, or fear: (TA:) [or,] accord.<br>\
to AZ, جَبَأْتُ عَنِ الرَّجُلِ, inf. n. جَبْءٌ and جُبُوْءٌ,<br>\
[to which Golius adds جُبُؤٌ and جِبَآءٌ, but, I<br>\
suspect, from incorrect MSS.,] means I drew, or<br>\
held, or hung, back from the man; or remained<br>\
behind him; or shrank from him; or shrank<br>\
from him and hid myself: and he cites (from<br>\
Nuseyb Ibn-Mihjen, TA)<br>\
فَهَلْ أَنَ إِلَّ مِثْلُ سَيِّقَةِ العِدَى<br>\
إِنِ اسْتَقْدَمَتْ نَحْرٌ وَإِنْ جَبَأَتْ عَقْرٌ<br>\
[And am I otherwise than like the beasts driven<br>\
away by the enemy? If they go before, slaughter<br>\
befalls them; and if they remain behind, hocking].<br>\
(S, TA.) You say also, مَا جَبَأَ عَنْ شَتْمِى He did<br>\
not draw back from reviling me; did not desist,<br>\
or abstain, therefrom. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It (a sword)<br>\
recoiled, or reverted, without penetrating, or<br>\
without effect: (K:) or so the former verb<br>\
[only]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It (the sight, or the eye,)<br>\
recoiled, or reverted: (K:) or so the former verb<br>\
[only]; and disliked, or disapproved, or hated,<br>\
the thing [that was before it]. (TA.) You say,<br>\
جَبَأَتْ عَيْنِى عَنِ  الشَّىْءِ My eye recoiled, or reverted,<br>\
from the thing. (S.) And of a woman of displeasing aspect you say, إِنَّ العَيْنِ لَتَجْبَأُ عَنْهَا<br>\
[Verily the eye recoils from her with dislike].<br>\
(As, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He disliked, disapproved, or hated:<br>\
(K:) or so the former verb [only]. (TA.) You<br>\
say, جَبَأَ الشَّىْءَ He disliked, &amp;c., the thing. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  He inclined his neck: (K:) or so the former<br>\
verb [only]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  He hid himself; (K, TA;)<br>\
[app. from fear;] as, for instance, a ضَبّ [q. v.]<br>\
in its hole. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  He, or it, came, or went,<br>\
forth, or out: (K:) [or so the former verb only.]<br>\
You say of a serpent, جَبَأَ عَلَيْهِ It came forth<br>\
upon him from its hole (S, TA) so as to frighten<br>\
him; and in like manner one says of a hyena,<br>\
and a ضَبّ, and a jerboa. (TA.) And جَبَأَ عَلَى<br>\
القَوْمِ He came forth unexpectedly upon the people,<br>\
or company of men. (TA.) And جَبَأَ الجَرَادُ The<br>\
locusts invaded, or came suddenly upon, the<br>\
country. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَجْبَأَتْ said of a land, (S,) or اجبأ said of a<br>\
place, (K,) It abounded with [the kind of truffles<br>\
called] كَمْأَة, (S,) or كَمْء, (so in some copies of<br>\
the K,) or [rather] جِبَأَة [a pl. or quasi-pl. n. of<br>\
جَبْء. (So in other copies of the K.)<br>\
-A2-  اجبأ<br>\
He hid a thing. (K.) And hence, He hid his<br>\
camels from the collector of the poor-rate. (IAar,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He sold seed-produce before it showed<br>\
itself to be in a good state, (S, K, TA,) or before<br>\
it came to maturity. (TA.) Hence, in a trad.,<br>\
مَنْ أَجْبَى فَقَدْ أَرْبَى [He who sells seed-produce<br>\
before it shows itself to be in a good state, or<br>\
before it has come to maturity, practices the like<br>\
of usury]: (S, TA:) originally with ء, (S,) which<br>\
is suppressed for the purpose of assimilation [to<br>\
اربى]. (TA. [See 4 in art. جبو and جبى.]<br>\
-A3-<br>\
اجبأ عَلَى القَوْمِ He overlooked the people, or company of men; or commanded, or had, a view of<br>\
them; or came in sight of them; syn. أَشْرَفَ. (K.)<br>\
جَبْءٌ sing. of جِبَأَةٌ, like as فَقْعٌ is of فِقَعَةٌ, and<br>\
غَرْدٌ of غِرَدَةٌ: (S:) or i. q. كَمْأَةٌ: (K:) or n. un.<br>\
of ↓ جَبْأَةٌ, which is a coll. gen. n., like كَمْأَةٌ:<br>\
(MF and TA, voce قَعْبٌ:) [J says,] جِبَأَةٌ signifies<br>\
Red كَمْأَة [or truffles]: or, accord. to El-Ahmar,<br>\
those [truffles] that incline to redness; كَمْأَةٌ signifying those that incline to dust-colour and<br>\
blackness; and فِقَعَةٌ, the white; and بَنَاتُ أَوْبَرَ,<br>\
the small: (S:) accord. to AHn, ↓ جَبْأَةٌ signifies<br>\
a white thing resembling a كَمْء, of which no use<br>\
is made: but accord. to IAar, the black كَمْأَة;<br>\
which, he says, are the best of كمأة: (TA:) the<br>\
pl. of جَبْءٌ is أَجْبُؤٌ, (S, K,) a pl. of pauc., (S,)<br>\
and جِبَأَةٌ, [as mentioned above,] or, accord. to<br>\
Sb, this is a quasi-pl. n., (TA,) and ↓ جَبَأٌ, (K,)<br>\
or this also is a quasi-pl. n. (TA.) ―<br>\

leather; also called قُرْزُومٌ. (S.)<br>\
-A3-  And The place<br>\
where the false ribs of the camel end, and thence as<br>\
far as the navel and udder. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The<br>\
part of the belly called the مَأْنَةٌ thereof; as<br>\
also جَأْبَةٌ; (Ibn-Buzurj, TA;) i. e. the part<br>\
between the navel and the pubes. (TA in art.<br>\
جأب.)<br>\
جُبَّأٌ (S, K) and ↓ جُبَّاءٌ? (Sb, K) Fearful, or<br>\
cowardly: (S, K:) fem. with ة: and therefore<br>\
the pl. is formed by the addition of و and ن.<br>\
(Sb, TA.) Mafrook Ibn-&#39; Amr Esh-Sheybánee<br>\
says,<br>\
فَمَا أَنَ مِنْ رَيْبِ المَنُونِ بِجُبَّأٍ<br>\
وَلَا أَنَا مِنْ سَيْبِ الإِلٰهِ بِآيِسِ<br>\
[But I am not fearful of the vicissitudes of<br>\
