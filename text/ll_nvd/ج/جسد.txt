جَسِدَ, aor<br>\
جَسَدَ (S, K,) inf.n. جَسَدٌ. (S, KL,)<br>\
It (blood) stuck, or adhere, (S K, KL,) بِهِ [to<br>\
him, or it]: (S, K:) and it (blood) became dry.<br>\
(KL.)<br>\
4<br>\
أُجْسِدَ It (a garment) was made to stick, or<br>\
adhere, to the جَسَد [or body]. (Fr, S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
inf. n. إِجْسَادٌ, It (a garment) was dyed so that it<br>\
stood up by reason of [the thickness of ] the dye.<br>\
(ISK, S.) [See مُجْسَدٌ.]<br>\

تجسّد from الجَسَدُ is like تجسّم from الجِسْمُ:<br>\
(S:) [apparently signifying He became, or assumed, a جَسَد, or body; or became corporeal, or<br>\
incarnate; and thus it is used by late writers, and<br>\
in the present day: but تجسّم generally signifies<br>\
he became corpulent: accord. to the TA, تجسّد,<br>\
said of a man, is like تجسّم: accord, to the KL,<br>\
the former signifies he became possessed of a body:<br>\
accord. to the PS, he became corporeal, or corpulent.]<br>\
جَسَدٌ The body, with the limbs or members, [or<br>\
whole person,] of a human being, and of a jinnee<br>\
(or genie), and of an angel: (El-Bári&#39;, L, Msb,<br>\
K:) it is thus applied only to the body of a<br>\
rational animal; (El-Bári&#39;, Msb;) to no body<br>\
that is nourished with food except that of a human<br>\
being; but to the body of every rational creature<br>\
that neither eats nor drinks, such as the genii and<br>\
the angels: (L:) [the genii, however, are commonly believed to eat and drink:] or, accord. to<br>\
ISd, it seems to be applied to a body other than<br>\
that of a human being tropically: (TA:) the<br>\
[golden] calf of the Children of Israel cried, but<br>\
did not eat nor drink; [wherefore it is termed<br>\
جسد;] and in the Kur [vii. 146 and xx. 90],<br>\
جَسَدًا is a substitute for عِجْلًا, or it may be meant<br>\
for ذَا جَسَدٍ: (L:) [but see another explanation<br>\
of جسدا, as there used, below:] or جَسَدٌ is syn.<br>\
with بَدَنٌ [which is generally held to signify the<br>\
body without the head and arms and legs]: (S,<br>\
A:) the pl. is أَجْسَادٌ. (Lh, Msb, TA.) Lh mentions the saying, إِنَّهَا لَحَسَنَةُ الأَجْسَادِ [Verily she is<br>\
beautiful in respect of body]; as though the sing.<br>\
of which the pl. is thus used were applied to every<br>\
separate part. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Saffron; (S, Msb, K)<br>\
as also ↓ جِسَادٌ: (Lth, IAar, ISk, S, A, Msb, K:)<br>\
or a similar dye: (S:) and ↓ the latter signifies<br>\
also a similar dye; (Lth, Msb,) red, or intensely<br>\
yellow: (Lth, TA:) or bastard saffron; syn.<br>\
عُصْفُرٌ; (Msb;) and so the former word. (L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S, L, Msb, K,) and ↓جَسِدٌ (L, K) and<br>\
↓ جَاسِدٌ (L, Msb, K) and ↓ جَسِيدٌ (L, K) and<br>\
↓ جِسَادٌ, (R,) (assumed tropical:)  Blood; (S;) as also ↓ مُجْسَدٌ, as<br>\
being likened to saffron: (Ham p. 215:) or dry<br>\
blood: (R, L, Msb, K:) pl. of the first as above.<br>\
(Ham p. 127.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Some say that عِجْلًا جَسَدًا, in<br>\
the Kur, [in two verses referred to above,] means<br>\
A red golden calf. (S.)<br>\
جَسِدٌ: see جَسَدٌ:<br>\

جِسَادٌ: see جَسَدٌ, in three places.<br>\
جَسِيدٌ: see جَسَدٌ.<br>\
جَاسِدٌ Blood sticking to (بِ) a person; as also<br>\
↓. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  See also جَسَدٌ.<br>\
جَلْسَدٌ (L, K in art. جلسد) and الجَلْسَدُ (S, L,<br>\
K, TA, in the CK الجَلَّسَدُ) the name of A certain<br>\
idol, (S, L, K,) which was worshipped in the time<br>\
of paganism: (L:) the ل is an augmentative<br>\
letter accord. to J and most of the leading lexicologists; but F disapproves of the mention of the<br>\
word in this art. (TA.)<br>\
مُجْسَدٌ Red. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S, Msb, K,) and<br>\
sometimes ↓ مِجْسَدٌ, (IF, Msb,) and ↓ مُجَسَّدٌ, (K,)<br>\
A garment dyed with saffron: (K:) or with<br>\
bastard saffron: (IAth, TA:) dyed with جِسَاد:<br>\
(IF, Msb:) or saturated with dye: (S:) or one<br>\
says, عَلَى فُلَانٍ ثَوْبٌ مُشْبَعٌ مِنَ الصِبْغِ [Upon such<br>\
a one is a garment saturated with dye]; and عَلَيْهِ<br>\
ثَوْبٌ مُفْدَمٌ [Upon him is a garment saturated<br>\
with red dye]; and when it is standing up by<br>\
reason of [the thickness of] the dye, it is termed<br>\
مُجْسَدٌ: (ISK, S:) the pl. of this word is مَجَاسِدُ.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also what next follows: ―<br>\
-b4-  and see<br>\
جَسَدٌ.<br>\
مِجْسَدٌ, (S, A, K,) or ↓ مُجْسَدٌ, (A,) the latter<br>\
is the original form, because it is from أُجْسِدَ,<br>\
meaning, &quot;it was made to stick, or adhere, to the<br>\
body,” (Fr, S,) like مِطْرَفٌ and مُطْرَفٌ, and مِصْحَفٌ<br>\
and مُصْحَفٌ, (Fr, TA,) A garment worn next the<br>\
body (IAar, S, A, K) by a woman, so that she<br>\
sweats in it: (TA:) and a garment worn next<br>\
the body dyed with saffron: (A:) pl. مَجَاسِدُ.<br>\
(IAar, A.) [Hence,] لَا يَخْرُجَنَّ إِلَى المَسَاجِدِ فِى<br>\
المَجَاسِدِ (IAar, A) They (women) shall by no<br>\
means go forth to the mosques in the shirts that<br>\
are next the body. (IAar.) ―<br>\
