جَلَسَ, (S, A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
جَلِسَ, (A, K,) inf. n.<br>\
جُلُوسٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ مَجْلَسٌ, (S, A, K,)<br>\
He placed his seat, or posteriors, upon rugged<br>\
[or rather elevated] ground, such as is termed<br>\
جَلْسٌ: this is the primary signification: (TA:)<br>\
[and hence,] He sat; i. q. قَعَدَ [when the latter<br>\
is used in its largest sense]: (Msb, and so S and<br>\
L and A and K in art. قعد:) you say, جَلَسَ مُتَرَبِّعًا<br>\
and قَعَدَ مُتَرَبِّعًا [He sat cross-legged]: (Msb:)<br>\
accord. to El-Fárábee and others, contr. of قَامَ;<br>\
and thus it has a more common application than<br>\
قَعَدَ [when the latter is used in its most proper<br>\
and restricted sense]: (Msb:) but قَعَدَ also signifies the contr. of قَامَ: (&#39;Orweh Ibn-Zubeyr, L<br>\
in art. قعد:) properly speaking, جَلَسَ differs<br>\
from قَعَدَ; the former signifying he sat up; or<br>\
sat after sleeping, or prostration, (Msb,) or after<br>\
lying on his side; (B, TA;) and the latter, he<br>\
sat down; or sat after standing: (Msb, B, TA:<br>\
and see other authorities to the same effect in art.<br>\
قعد:) for جُلُوسٌ is a change of place from low<br>\
to high, and قُعُودٌ is a change of place from high<br>\
to low: and one says, جَلَسَ مُتَّكِئًا, but not قَعَدَ<br>\
مُتَّكِئًا, meaning [He sat] leaning, or reclining,<br>\
upon one side: (Msb:) but both these verbs<br>\
sometimes signify he was, or became: and thus,<br>\
[it is said,] جَلَسَ مُتَرَبِّعًا and فَعَدَ مُتَرَبِّعًا signify<br>\
he was, or became, cross-legged: and جَلَسَ بَيْنَ<br>\
شُعَبِهَا الأَرْبَعِ in like manner signifies he was, or<br>\
became, [between her four limbs,] (El-Fárábee,<br>\
Msb,) because the man, in this case, is resting<br>\
upon his own four limbs. (Msb.) [جَلَسَ مَعَهُ<br>\
and جَلَسَ إِلَيْهِ, like خَلَا معه and خلا اليه, signify<br>\
the same; i. e. He sat with him: or the latter,<br>\
he sat by him; like “ assedit ei. ”] An instance<br>\
of the inf. n. مَجْلَسٌ is found in a trad., in which<br>\
it is said, فَإِذَا أَتَيْتُمْ إِلَى المَجْلِسِ فَأَعْطُوا الطَّرِيقَ حَقَّهُ<br>\
[But when ye come to sitting, perform ye the<br>\
duties relating to the road]. (TA.) [The trad.<br>\
commences thus: إِيَّاكُمْ وَالجُلُوسَ عَلَى الطُّرُقَاتِ<br>\
Beware ye of sitting on the roads: and then,<br>\
after the words before cited, (in which, however,<br>\
in my copy of the Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer, instead of<br>\
المجلس, I find المَجَالِسِ, which is pl. of المَجْلِسُ,)<br>\
it is added that the duties thus alluded to are the<br>\
lowering of the eyes, the putting away or aside<br>\
what is hurtful or annoying, the returning of<br>\
salutations, the enjoining of that which is good,<br>\
and the forbidding of that which is evil.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
جَلَسَتِ الرَّخَمَةُ (tropical:)  The aquiline vulture lay upon its<br>\
breast on the ground; syn. جَثَمَت: a saying<br>\
applied to him who is of the seceders. (A, TA.)<br>\
[See also قَعَدَ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  جَلَسَ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  It (a<br>\
thing, as, for instance, a plant,) remained, or<br>\
continued. (AHn, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, (aor.<br>\
جَلِسَ, inf. n.<br>\
جَلْسٌ, TA,) He came to الجَلْس, (TA,) or [the<br>\
high country called] Nejd: (T, S, A, TA:) and<br>\
in like manner said of a cloud; it came to Nejd.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
جالسهُ, inf. n. مُجَالَسَةٌ and جِلَاسٌ, [He sat<br>\
with him.] (TA.) You say, لَا تُجَالِسْ مَنْ لَا<br>\
تُجَانِسْ [Sit not with him with whom thou wilt<br>\
not be congenial]. (A, TA.) And كَرِيمُ النِّحَاسِ<br>\
طَيِّيبُ الجِلَاسِ [Generous in origin, or disposition;<br>\
pleasant to sit with;] is said of a man. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اجلسهُ [He seated him; made him to sit:<br>\
or he made him to sit up]: (S, K, TA:) he gave<br>\
him place, or settled him, (مَكَّنَهُ,) in sitting. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تجاسلوا [They sat together; one with<br>\
another;] (S, A, TA;) فِى المَجَالِسِ [in the sittingplaces]. (S.)<br>\
10<br>\
استجلسهُ [He asked him, or desired him, to<br>\
sit: or to sit up.]. You say, رَآنِى قَائِمًا فَاسْتَجْلَسَنِى<br>\
[He saw me standing, and he asked me, or desired<br>\
me, to sit]: (A, TA:) but this is at variance with<br>\
what we have mentioned in the beginning of the<br>\
art., respecting the distinction [between جَلَسَ and<br>\
قَعَدَ]. (TA.)<br>\
جَلْسٌ Rugged ground or land: (S, K:) this is<br>\
the primary signification. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also, app.,<br>\
Elevated ground or land:] a place elevated and<br>\
hard: or, as some say, a tract of land extending<br>\
widely. (Ham p. 688.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And hence,] الجَلْسُ<br>\
What is elevated above the غَوْر [or low country]:<br>\
(TA:) applied especially to the country of Nejd.<br>\
(T, S, M, K.)<br>\
-A2-  [Persons sitting: or sitting up:]<br>\
a quasi-pl. n., accord. to Sb, or a pl., accord. to<br>\
Akh, of ↓ جَالِسٌ: said to be used as sing. and pl.<br>\
and fem. and masc.; but this assertion is of no<br>\
account: (ISd, L:) or the people of a مَجْلِس:<br>\
(Lh, ISd, L, K:) [↓ جُلُوسٌ is also a pl. of ↓ جَالِسٌ;<br>\
like as بُكِىٌّ, originally بُكُوىٌ, is of بَاكِ: or it is<br>\
an inf. n. used as an epithet: see جَاثٍ:)] you<br>\
say قَوْمٌ جُلُوسٌ [a company of men sitting: or<br>\
sitting up]. (S.) [See also مَجْلِسٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
woman who sits in the فِنَآء [or court of the house],<br>\
not quitting it: (K:) or she who is of noble rank<br>\
(K, TA) among her people. (TA.)<br>\
جِلْسٌ: see جَلِيسٌ, in two places.<br>\
جَلْسَةٌ A single sitting: or sitting up. (Msb.)<br>\
جِلْسَةٌ A mode or manner, (TA,) kind, (Msb,)<br>\
or state, (S, A, Msb,) of sitting: or of sitting up.<br>\
(S, * A, * Msb, K. *) You say, هُوَ حَسَنُ الجِلْسَةِ<br>\
[He has a good mode, &amp;c., of sitting]. (A,<br>\
Msb, K.)<br>\
جُلَسَةٌ A man (S) who sits much; sedentary.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
جُلُوسٌ: see جَلْسٌ.<br>\
جَلِيسٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ جِلِّيسٌ (TA, as<br>\
found in a copy of the K, [but this is an intensive<br>\
form,]) and ↓ جِلْسٌ (S, A, K) A companion with<br>\
whom one sits: (A, Msb, K:) fem. of the first<br>\
with ة: (TA:) and pl. [of the same] جُلَسَآءُ (A,<br>\
K) and [irreg., being by rule pl. of جَالِسٌ,] جُلَّاسٌ.<br>\
(K.) You say, ↓ هُوَ جِلْسِى and جَلِيسِى [He is<br>\
my companion with whom I sit]; like as you<br>\
say, هُوَ خِدْنِى and خَدِينِى. (S.)<br>\
جِلِّيسٌ: see جَلِيسٌ.<br>\
جَالِسٌ: see جَلْسٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A<br>\
man, and a cloud, coming to [the high country<br>\
called] Nejd. (TA.) You say, رَأَيْتُهُمْ يَعْدُونَ<br>\
جَالِسِينَ I saw them running, coming to Nejd.<br>\
(A, TA.)<br>\
مَجْلَسٌ: see 1: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see مَجْلِسٌ.<br>\
مَجْلِسٌ A sitting-place; (S, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ with ة; (Fr, Lh, Sgh, K;) similar to مَكَانٌ and<br>\
مَكَانَةٌ: (Sgh, TA:) [a place where persons sit<br>\
together and converse; a sitting-room:] a thing<br>\
upon which one sits: (MF:) some make a strange<br>\
distinction between مَجْلِسٌ and ↓ مَجْلَسٌ, asserting<br>\
the former to be applied to the chamber or house<br>\
(بَيْت) [in which people sit]; and the latter, to a<br>\
place of honour upon which it is forbidden to sit<br>\
without permission; but the former is the only<br>\
correct form of the two: (MF, TA:) pl. مَجَالِسُ.<br>\
(S, Msb.) You say, اُرْزُنْ فِى مَجْلِسِكَ and ↓ مَجْلِسَتِكَ<br>\
[Be thou grave] in thy sitting-place. (Fr, Sgh.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  The people of a مَجْلِس; (Msb, TA;) elliptical, for أَهْلُ مَجْلِسٍ: (TA:) an assembly, or a<br>\
company of men, sitting [together]: (Th, TA:)<br>\
not well explained as being, with the article ال,<br>\
syn. with النَّاسُ: (TA:) persons sitting, or sitting<br>\
up. (A, TA.) [See also جَلْسٌ.] You say, اِنْفَضَّ<br>\
المَجْلِسُ (assumed tropical:)  [The assembly of persons sitting together<br>\
broke up]. (Msb.) And رَأَيْتُهُمْ مَجْلِسًا I saw<br>\
them sitting. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  An oration or a discourse, or an exhortation, (خُطْبَةٌ أَوْ عِظَةٌ,)<br>\
delivered in a مَجْلِس; like مَقَامَةٌ. (Mtr, in the<br>\
Preface to Har.) ―<br>\
-b4-  It is also used in the same<br>\
manner as حَضْرَة and جَنَاب: you say مَجْلِسُ فُلَانٍ<br>\
[meaning (assumed tropical:)  The object of resort, with whom others<br>\
sit and converse, such a one]; like حَضْرَةُ فُلَانٍ.<br>\
(Kull p. 146.) [See arts. حضر and جنب. But<br>\
this usage I believe to be post-classical.] ―<br>\
-b5-  [Also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A stool; meaning, an evacuation. So in medical<br>\
books.]<br>\
