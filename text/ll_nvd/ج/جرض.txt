(MF in art. غص, q.v.:) and the above-mentioned<br>\
phrase also signifies (A) he swallowed his spittle<br>\
with difficulty, or trouble, or labour, contending<br>\
against anxiety, or grief. (S, A, K.) You say<br>\

(ADk, K:) or affected by intense anxiety or<br>\
grief: (TA:) [see also جَرَّاضٌ:] pl. جَرْضَى; (A,<br>\
K;) like as مَرْضَى is pl. of مَرِيضٌ. (A, TA.)<br>\
You say, أَفْلَتَ فُلَانٌ جَرِيضًا, or أُفْلِتَ, Such a one<br>\
escaped, or was made to escape, being near to<br>\
death; (TA;) or being at the point of death, his<br>\
soul having reached his fauces, so that he was<br>\
choked by it. (A, TA.) And مَاتَ فُلَانٌ جَرِيضًا<br>\

(S.)<br>\
-A2-  In the following prov., حَالَ الجَرِيضُ دُونَ<br>\
القَرِيضِ [The جريض interposed as an obstacle in<br>\
the way of the قريض], الجريض signifies the thing<br>\
choking the throat or fauces; (S, A;) and القريض<br>\
signifies the cud: the meaning being, the thing<br>\
choking the throat or fauces hindered from chewing the cud: (A:) or the former signifies the<br>\
choking, or having the throat, or fauces, obstructed; and the latter, the poetry: (TA:) or<br>\
the former, the swallowing of spittle in dying;<br>\
and the latter, the sound, or voice, of a man in<br>\
dying: (Er-Riyáshee:) or the former, spittle<br>\
swallowed: (Har p. 150, q. v.:) and also, the<br>\
chokings (غُصَص) of death: [see also جَرَضٌ:] and<br>\
the moving to and fro of the two jaws at death:<br>\
(TA:) the prov. relates to an affair which is<br>\
hindered by some obstacle: (A, O, K:) or it is<br>\
said on the occasion of any affair which was possible and which has been hindered by the intervention of some obstacle: and the first who said<br>\
it was &#39;Obeyd Ibn-El-Abras, when El-Mundhir<br>\
[on one of the days when it was his custom to<br>\
slay whomsoever he met] desired him to recite<br>\
some of his verses: (Zeyd Ibn-Kuthweh:) or the<br>\
first who said it was Jowshan [in some copies of<br>\
the K, Showshan, which, as is said in the TA, is<br>\
a mistake,] El-Kilábee, when his father, having<br>\
forbidden him to poetize, and seeing him sick of<br>\
grief thereat, and at the point of death, gave him<br>\
permission to do so: (K, TA:) whereupon, after<br>\
saying these words, he recited some verses, and<br>\
died. (TA.)<br>\
جَرَّاضٌ A strangler. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Suffering intense, or violent, grief. (TA.) [See also جَرِيضٌ.]<br>\
