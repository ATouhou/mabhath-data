جاوِرهُ, inf. n. مُجَاوَرَةٌ and جِوَارٌ (S, Msb, K)<br>\
and ↓ جُوَارٌ, (S, M, and some copies of the K,) or<br>\
the last is a simple subst., (Msb,) and ↓ جَوَارٌ, (M,<br>\
and so in some copies of the K instead of جُوَارٌ,)<br>\
of which forms the second (جِوَارٌ) is more chaste<br>\
than the third (S, TA) and than the fourth, as<br>\

though some disapprove of it, and assert the third<br>\
and the fourth to be more chaste; (TA;) He<br>\
became his جار [or neighbour]; (K;) he lived in<br>\
his neighbourhood, or near to him: (Msb, TA:)<br>\
or he lived in a dwelling contiguous to his. (Msb.)<br>\

during one whole day, fasting from daybreak to<br>\
sunset, and occupying himself in prayer and<br>\
religious meditation, without any interruption by<br>\
affairs distracting the mind from devotion and<br>\
not pressing]. (S, K.) But جاور بِمَكَّةَ, and بِالمَدِينَةِ,<br>\
signifies absolutely He abode in Mekkeh, and<br>\
El-Medeeneh; not necessarily implying conformity with the conditions of اِعْتِكَاف required<br>\
by the law [though generally meaning for the<br>\
purpose of study: and so in the neighbourhood of<br>\
the great collegiate mosque called the Azhar, in<br>\

him; granted him refuge; (K;) preserved, saved,<br>\
rescued, or liberated, him; (S, A, Msb, K;) from<br>\
(مِنْ) wrongful, unjust, injurious, or tyrannical,<br>\
treatment; (S, K;) from punishment; (S, A;) or<br>\
from what he feared: (Msb:) he aided him; succoured him; delivered him from evil: the أَ having<br>\
a privative effect. (Mgh.) It is said of God, يُجِيرُ<br>\
وَلَا يُجَارُ عَلَيْهِ He protects, but none is protected<br>\
against him. (TA.) And in the Kur [lxxii. 22],<br>\
قُلْ إِنِّى لَنْ يُجِيرَنِى مِنَ اللّٰهِ أَحَدٌ Verily none will<br>\
protect me against God. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اجار المَتَاعَ He<br>\

تَجَاوَرُوا and ↓ اِجْتَوَرُوا (S, K) are syn., (S,)<br>\
signifying They became mutual neighbours; they<br>\
lived near together: (K, * TA:) the [radical] و<br>\
in the latter verb remaining unaltered because<br>\
this verb is syn. with one in which the و<br>\
must preserve its original form on account of<br>\
the quiescence of the preceding letter, namely,<br>\
تجاوروا, (S, TA,) and to show that it is syn.<br>\
therewith: but اِجْتَارُوا also occurs. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Also They bound themselves by a covenant to<br>\
protect one another.]<br>\
8<br>\
إِجْتَوَرَ see 6.<br>\

استجار and ↓ جَارَ, (K,) the latter like جَارٌ<br>\
as syn. with مُسْتَجِيرٌ, (TA,) He sought, desired,<br>\

how this is, unless the sing. be supposed to be<br>\
