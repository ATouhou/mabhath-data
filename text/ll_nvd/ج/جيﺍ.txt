جَآءَ, aor. يَجِىْءُ, inf. n. مَجِىْءٌ (S, Msb, K,<br>\
&amp;c., [the most common form, but] deviating from<br>\
the general rule [respecting inf. ns. of this class],<br>\
for the inf. n. of a verb of the form فَعَلَ having<br>\
its aor. of the form يَفْعِلُ is [accord. to the general<br>\
rule, if commencing with an augmentative م,]<br>\
مَفْعَلٌ, though some words, beside مَجِىْءٌ, deviate<br>\
from this rule by being of the measure مَفْعِلٌ, [for<br>\
مَجِىْءٌ is originally مَجْيِئٌ,] as مَعِيشٌ and مَكِيلٌ<br>\
and مَصِيرٌ and مَسِيرٌ and مَحِيدٌ and مَمِيلٌ and<br>\
مَقِيلٌ and مَزِيدٌ and مَعِيلٌ and مَبِيعٌ and مَحِيصٌ<br>\
and مَحِيضٌ, S, * TA) and جَيْئَةٌ (S, K, of the form<br>\
of an inf. n. of un., but used as an inf. n. in an<br>\
absolute sense, like رَجْفَةٌ and رَحْمَةٌ, S, TA) and<br>\
جَىْءٌ, (K,) He, or it, came; or was, or became,<br>\
present; syn. أَتَى; (S, K;) or حَضَرَ, said of a<br>\
man [&amp;c.]; (Msb;) or حَصَلَ [meaning it came,<br>\
came to pass, happened, took place, betided, befell,<br>\
or occurred; it resulted; it ensued; &amp;c.]; and<br>\
it is used in relation to ideal, as well as real, substantives; so that إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ اللّٰهِ [When the<br>\
assistance of God shall come (in the Kur ex. 1)]<br>\
is [not a figurative but] a proper phrase. (Er-Rághib, TA.) Sb mentions, on the authority of<br>\
certain of the Arabs, هُوَ يَجِيكَ [for هو يَجِيْؤُكَ<br>\
He comes, or will come, to thee], with the hemzeh<br>\
suppressed: (TA:) and he also mentions يَجُوْءُ<br>\
as a dial. var. of يَجِىْءُ. (Id. in art. جوأ, q. v.)<br>\
[As shown above,] جَآءَ is used intransitively and<br>\
transitively. (Msb, MF.) say, جَآءَ زَيْدٌ Zeyd<br>\
came; or was, or became, present. (Msb.) And<br>\
جِئْتُ مَجِيْئًا حَسَنًا [I came with a good coming;<br>\
or in a good manner]. (S.) And جِئْتُ زَيْدًا I<br>\
came to Zeyd. (Msb.) And sometimes one says,<br>\
جِئْتُ إِلَيْهِ meaning I went [as well as I came] to<br>\
him, or it. (Msb.) And جِئْتُ مِنَ البَلَدِ [I came<br>\
from the town, or country]: and مِنَ القَوْمِ,<br>\
meaning مِنْ عِنْدِ القَوْمِ [from the presence of the<br>\
people, or company of men]. (Msb.) And جَآءَ<br>\
الغَيْثُ The rain [came, or] descended. (Msb.)<br>\
And جَآءَ أَمْرُ السُّلْطَانِ The order, or command, of<br>\
the Sultán came, or arrived. (Msb.) And جِئْتُ<br>\
بِهِ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ أَجَأْتُهُ, both signifying the<br>\
same, (S, K,) [I came with him, or it;] I brought<br>\
him, or it, with me. (Msb.) And الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ الَّذِى<br>\
جَآءَ بِكَ [Praise be to God who brought thee];<br>\
and الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ إِذْ جِئْتَ [Praise be to God because,<br>\
or that, thou camest, or hast come]; but not<br>\
الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ الَّذِى جِئْتَ: (S, TA:) and [in like<br>\
manner] you say, الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ إِذْ كَانَ كَذَا; but<br>\
not الحَمْدُ للّٰهِ الَّذِى كَانَ كَذَا unless you say بِهِ<br>\
or مِنْهُ or عَنْهُ [after الذى]. (ISk, TA.) [Hence,<br>\
جَآءَ بِوَلَدٍ He begot a child, or children; like أَتَى<br>\
بِوَلَدٍ. And جَآءتْ بِهِ She brought him forth; gave<br>\
birth to him; like أَتَتْ بِهِ. And جَآءَ بِمَعْنًى It (a<br>\
word) conveyed, or imported, a meaning.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[جَآءَ بِشَىْءٍ also signifies He brought to pass, did,<br>\
executed, performed, or effected, a thing: and he<br>\
said, gave utterance to, or uttered, a thing: like<br>\
أَتَى بِهِ in both these senses.] And جَآءَ كَذَا He<br>\
did thus, or such a thing. (TA.) Hence, [in the<br>\
Kur xix. 28,] لَقَدْ جِئْتِ شَيْئًا فَرِيًّا (TA) [Verily, O<br>\
Mary, thou hast done] a thing hitherto unknown;<br>\
a thing deemed strange. (Bd. [See another ex.<br>\
voce إِمْرٌ, likewise from the Kur.]) And جِئْتُ شَيْئًا<br>\
حَسَنًا I did a good thing. (Msb.) And جَآءَ بِالبَدِيعِ<br>\
He produced a new saying, or new poetry, not<br>\
after the similitude of anything preceding. (TA<br>\
in art. بدع.) And جَآءَ جَرْيًا بَعْدَ جَرْىٍ (K in art.<br>\
تأم) or [more commonly] جاء بِجَرْىٍ بَعْدَ جَرْىٍ<br>\
(M in that art.) [He (a horse) performed, or<br>\
fetched, run after run]. ―<br>\
-b3-  جَآء is also syn. with<br>\
صَارَ, like أَتَى; as in the saying, جَآءَ البِنَآءُ مُحْكَمًا<br>\
The building became, or came to be, firm, strong,<br>\
or compact. (Kull p. 11.) [And hence the phrase,]<br>\
مَا جَآءَتْ حَاجَتَكَ, (M, K,) thus in all the copies of<br>\
the K, with the noun in the accus. case; i. e.<br>\
What became, or has become, thy want? syn.<br>\
مَا صَارَتْ; (M, K;) or What was thy want? syn.<br>\
مَا كَانَتْ: (Er-Radee, TA:) ما being here an<br>\
interrogative, and the [implied] pronoun [in the<br>\
verb] being made fem. because its predicate is<br>\
fem.: but some say حَاجَتُكَ, in the nom. case, [as<br>\
it is in the CK, meaning What did, or has, thy<br>\
want become?] regarding حاجتك as the subject of<br>\
جاءت, and ما as the predicate of this verb. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  See also 3.<br>\
3<br>\
مُجَايَأَةٌ [inf. n. of جَايَأَ] signifies The act of<br>\
facing, or fronting; being opposite, or over<br>\
against: (IAar, K:) and the act of coinciding;<br>\
as also جِيَآءٌ. (AZ, K.) You say of a man,<br>\
جَايَأَنِى مِنْ قُرْبٍ He faced me, fronted me, was<br>\
opposite to me, or was over against me, at a short<br>\
distance. (TA.) And مَرَّ بِى مُجَايَأَةً He passed<br>\
by me being in front, or opposite. (TA.) And<br>\
جَايَأْتُ فُلَانًا I coincided with such a one in his<br>\
coming. (TA.) And لَوْ جَاوَزْتَ هٰذَا المَكَانَ لَجَايَأْتَ<br>\
الغَيْثَ Hadst thou passed beyond this place, thou<br>\
hadst met with rain, or coincided with rain in its<br>\
coming. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ↓ جَاآنِى فَجِئْتُهُ, [so in copies<br>\
of the S, and in copies of the K, as from the S,<br>\
but in the TA, as from the S, جَآءَأَنِى, and said to<br>\
be with two hemzehs, though this is evidently<br>\
wrong,] aor. أَجِيْؤُهُ, the former verb of the measure فَاعَلَنِى, (S,) is [said to be] a mistake for<br>\
جَايَأَنِى فجئته, since the former verb has an<br>\
infirm letter [ى] for its medial radical and ء for<br>\
its final, not the reverse, (Sgh, K,) [therefore]<br>\
what J says is not allowable unless it be an<br>\
instance of transposition; (IB, TA;) but what is<br>\
given by F [and Sgh as the correct form] is that<br>\
which is accord. to rule, and what J says is that<br>\
which has been heard from the Arabs, as ISd has<br>\
pointed out; (TA;) [and rule is not to be regarded when it is contr. to classical usage;] the<br>\
meaning is, He vied with me, or strove to surpass<br>\
me, in frequency of coming, and I surpassed him<br>\
therein. (S, K.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَجَاءَهُ He made him, or it, to come. (Kull<br>\
p. 11.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] أَجَأْتُهُ i. q. جِئْتُ بِهِ: see 1.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَجَأْتُهُ إِلَيْهِ I compelled him, constrained<br>\
him, or necessitated him, to have recourse, or<br>\
betake himself, to it; (Fr, S, K;) or made him to<br>\
want it, or be in need of it: (S:) in the dial. of<br>\
Temeem, أَشَأْتُهُ. (TA in art. شيأ.) It is said in a<br>\
prov., شَرٌّ مَا يُجِيْؤُكَ إِلَى مُخَّةِ عُرْقُوبٍ [It is an<br>\
evil thing that compels thee to have recourse to<br>\
the marrow of a hock]; for, as As says, the<br>\
عرقوب contains no marrow, and only he who<br>\
cannot obtain any [other] thing is made to want<br>\
it. (S.) And it is said in the Kur xix. 23,<br>\
فَأَجَآءَهَا المَخَاضُ إِلَى جِذْعِ النَّخْلَةِ And the motion<br>\
of the child in her womb compelled her to betake<br>\
herself to the trunk of the palm-tree. (Bd.)<br>\
جِيْئَةٌ [A coming;] a subst. from جَآءَ, (S, K,)<br>\
of the measure فِعْلَةٌ, with kesr to the ج. (S.)<br>\
جَئِئٌ and جَأّءٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
جَيَّآءٌ, (K,) mentioned by Sb as an extr. word,<br>\
(TA,) [but regularly formed, of the measure<br>\
فَعَّالٌ,] and ↓ جَأّءٌ, also written جَأَّاءٌ, (K,) with the<br>\
ى changed into hemzeh, (TA,) and ↓ جَئِئٌ, (K,)<br>\
[originally جَيِئٌ, of the measure فَعِلٌ, denoting<br>\
intensiveness, in the CK written جَايِئٌ,] mentioned by IJ as anomalous, A frequent comer.<br>\
(TA.) One says, إِنَّهُ لَجَيَّآءٌ بِخَيْرٍ Verily he is a<br>\
frequent bringer of good. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
جَآءٍ, originally جَايِئٌ, then جَائِئٌ, then جَائِىٌ,<br>\
and then جَآءٍ, Coming; act. part. n. of 1.]<br>\
