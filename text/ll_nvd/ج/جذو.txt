جَذَا, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
جَذُوَ, (TA,) inf. n. جَذْوٌ and<br>\
جُذُوٌّ, (K,) It (a thing, TA) stood firmly; as<br>\
also ↓ اجذى. (S, K.) You say also, جَذَا عَلَى<br>\
شَىْءٍ He [or it, for instance, a stone of those<br>\
(three in number) upon which a cooking-pot is<br>\
places, as is implied in the S, (see جَاذٍ,)] remained firm upon a thing. (S.) And جَذَا القُرَادُ<br>\
فِى جَنْبِ البَعِير The ticks stuck, and clave, to the<br>\
side of the camel: (ISd, K, TA:) and جذا بِالجَمَلِ<br>\
clung to the camel. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  I. q. جَثًا [He sat<br>\
upon his knees; &amp;c.]; (AA, Fr, S, K;) as also<br>\
↓ اِجْذَوَى, [in form] like اِرْعَوَى; (TA;) except<br>\
that جذا is more indicative of keeping to a place:<br>\
(Kh, TA:) or he stood upon the extremities of<br>\
his toes: (As, K:) accord. to Th, جُذُوٌّ is [the<br>\
standing] upon the extremities of the toes; and<br>\
جُثُوٌّ is [the sitting] upon the knees: (TA:) and<br>\
accord. to IAar, ↓ جَاذٍ means [a man standing]<br>\
upon his feet; and جَاثٍ, [one sitting] upon his<br>\
knees. (S, TA.) Accord. to El-Hasan Ibn-&#39;AbdAllah El-Kátib El-Isbahánee, جَذَا, inf. n. جُذُوٌّ,<br>\
said of a bird, means He stood upon the extremities of his toes, and warbled, and went round<br>\
in his warbling; which he does only when seeking the female: and said of a horse, it means he<br>\
stood upon his toes; and in like manner when<br>\
said of a man, whether for dancing or for some<br>\
other purpose. (TA.) A poet says, (S,) namely,<br>\
En-Noamán Ibn-Nadleh, (TA,)<br>\
إِذَا شِئْتُ غَنَّتْنِى دَهَاقِينُ قَرْيَةٍ<br>\
وَصَنَّاجَةٌ تَجْذُو عَلَى حَرْفِ مَنْسِمِ<br>\
[When I will, the husbandmen of a village sing<br>\
to me, and a female player with the cymbals,<br>\
standing upon the extremity of a toe]. (S, TA:<br>\
but in the latter, عَلَى كُلِّ مَنْسِمِ [upon every<br>\
toe].) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, inf. n. جُذُوٌّ, He, or it, was, or<br>\
became, erect, and straight; (TA;) and so<br>\
↓ اِجْذَوْذَى, inf. n. اِجْذِيذَآءٌ. (Az, TA.) See جَوَاذِ<br>\
as applied to she-camels, in two places, voce جَاذٍ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  It (a camel&#39;s hump) bore fat [so that it<br>\
became elevated]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  جَذَا مَنْخِرَاهُ His<br>\
nostrils were, or became, raised and extended.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Er-Rá&#39;ee, describing a strong, or sturdy,<br>\
she-camel, says,<br>\
لَمْ يَجْذُ مِرْفَقُهَا فِى الدَّفِ مِنْ زَوَرِ<br>\
meaning Her elbow did not stand out far from<br>\
the side by reason of [the distortion termed] زَوَر.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اجذى: see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He<br>\
(a young camel) bore fat in his hump. (Ks, S,<br>\
K.) El-Khansà says,<br>\
يُجْذِينَ نَيًّا وَلَا يجْذِينَ قِرْدَانَا<br>\
They bear fat [in their humps], and have not<br>\
ticks clinging to them. (IB, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  He lifted<br>\
a stone, (AA, S, TA,) in order that he might<br>\
know thereby his strength. (TA.) One says,<br>\
↓ هُمْ يُجْذُونَ حَجَرًا وَيَتَجَاذَوْنَهُ [They lift a stone,<br>\
in order to prove their strength, and vie, one<br>\
with another, in lifting it, for that purpose].<br>\
(TA.) ↓ تَجَاذٍ, in the lifting of a stone, is like<br>\
تَجَاث: (S, TA:) تَجَاذَوْا meaning تَرَابَعُوا<br>\
لِيَرْفَعُوهُ [They vied, one with another, to lift the<br>\
stone, for trial of strength]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اجذى<br>\
طَرْفَهُ [in the CK, erroneously, طَرَفَهُ,] He raised<br>\
his eye, or sight, and cast it before him. (K, TA.)<br>\

جِذْوَةٌ and جُذْوَةٌ and جَذْوَةٌ (S, Msb, K) [A<br>\
brand, or fire-brand;] i. q. جِذْمَةٌ, (AO, S, K,)<br>\
i. e. a thick piece of wood, having fire at the end<br>\
of it or not: (AO, S, in explanation of the first:)<br>\
or a thick piece of fire-wood, not flaming: (AO,<br>\
TA, in explanation of جِذْوَةٌ مِنَ النَّارِ:) or a thick<br>\
stick, one end of which is a live coal: (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, TA:) or a thick stick upon which fire is<br>\
taken [by kindling one end]: (ISk, TA:) and<br>\
a piece (قَبْسَةٌ, K, or قِطْعَةٌ, Har p. 471) of fire:<br>\
(K, Har:) or a portion of fire-wood that remains<br>\
after flaming: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and a live<br>\
coal: (S, K:) or a flaming live coal: (Msb:)<br>\
or جِذْوَةٌ مِنَ النَّارِ means a piece of live coal; so<br>\
in the language of all the Arabs: (Mujáhid, S,<br>\
TA:) pl. [of the first] جِذًى and [of the second]<br>\
جُذًى (S, Msb, K) and (of the third, TA) جَذًى<br>\
(Msb, TA, and so in a copy of the S) and جِذَآءٌ,<br>\
(AAF, K,) which is held by ISd to be a pl. of<br>\
the third. (TA.)<br>\
جُذَآءٌ: see جُدَآءٌ, in art. جدى.<br>\
جَاذٍ [part. n. of 1; fem. جَاذِيَةٌ: pl. masc.<br>\
جِذَآءٌ; pl. fem. جَاذِيَاتٌ and جَوَاذٍ]. A rájiz says,<br>\
(S,) namely, &#39;Amr Ibn-Jebel-El-Asadee, (TA,)<br>\
لَمْ يُبْقِ مِنْهَا سَبَلُ الرَّذَاذِ<br>\
غَيْرَ أَثَافِى مِرْجَلٍ جَوَاذِى<br>\
i. e. [The continual fine rain left not thereof save<br>\
the three stones that were the supports of a cooking-pot] remaining firm. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  I. q. جَاثٍ<br>\
[Sitting upon his knees; &amp;c.]: (Fr, TA:) or<br>\
sitting upon his heels, with his feet upright, [resting] upon the extremities of his toes: (S:) or<br>\
standing upon the extremities of the toes: (AA,<br>\
S:) see also 1: pl. [masc.] جَذَآءٌ. (S) Aboo-Duwád describes mares as جَاذِيَاتٌ عَلَى السَّنَابِكِ,<br>\
i. e. Standing upon the toes. (AA, S, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
جَوَاذٍ, (K,) applied to she-camels, (TA,) means<br>\
That bear themselves erect (↓ تَجْذُو) in their<br>\
course, or pace, as though they lifted their feet<br>\
clear from the ground; (K, TA;) on the authority of Aboo-Leylà: (TA:) [the last words of<br>\
the explanation in the K are كَأَنَّهَا تَقْلَعُ: in the<br>\
TA, كانها تقلع السَّيْرَ: I suppose that السَّيْرَ is for<br>\
فِى السَّيْرِ; and that the pret. of the aor. here used<br>\
is قَلِعَ; for قَلِعٌ, which is of the regular form of<br>\
a part. n. of such a verb as قَلِعَ, means “ raising<br>\
the feet clear from the ground in walking &amp;c.: ”<br>\
but in one copy of the K, I find تُقَلّعُ: and another<br>\
reading in some work seems to be تُقْلِعُ; for]<br>\
ISd says, I know not جَذَا with the meaning of<br>\
أَسْرَعَ nor of أَقْلَعَ: and As says that جَوَاذٍ means<br>\
quick, or swift, camels, that do not stretch themselves forth in their course, or pace, but bear<br>\
themselves erect (وَيَنْتَصِبْنَ ↓ يَجْذُونَ). (TA.)<br>\
مُجْذٍ [act. part. n. of 4]. مِثْلُ الأَرْزَةِ المُجْذِيَةِ<br>\
عَلَى الأَرْضِ, (S,) or كَالأَرْزَةِ المجذية على وَجْهِ<br>\
الارض, (TA,) occurring in a trad., (S, TA,) describing the unbeliever, (TA,) means [Like the<br>\
pine-tree] that is firm (S, TA) and erect [upon<br>\
the ground]. (TA.)<br>\
مُجْذَوْذٍ [in the CK, erroneously, المَجْذُوْذِىُّ,]<br>\
Keeping constantly to the dwelling, or to the<br>\
camel&#39;s saddle and the dwelling, (الرَّحْل and<br>\
المَنْزِل, AA, S, K,) not quitting it: (AA, S:) like<br>\
مُجْذَوْذٍ عَلَى الرَّحْلِ. (AA, S) ―<br>\
-b2-  And A man<br>\
who lowers, or abases, himself; (El-Hejeree, ISd,<br>\
TA;) as though he clave to the ground by reason<br>\
of his abjectness; from جَذَا القُرَادُ فِى جَنْبِ البَعِيرِ<br>\
[q. v.]. (ISd, TA.)<br>\
