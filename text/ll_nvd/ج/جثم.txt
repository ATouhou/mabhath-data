جَثَمَ, aor.<br>\
جَثِمَ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and<br>\

camel, (Msb, K,) and a jerboa, (K,) and a man,<br>\
(S, K,) He clave to the ground: (S, K:) or kept<br>\
to his place, not quitting it: (K:) or fell upon his<br>\
breast: (Msb, * K:) جُثُومٌ in the case of a bird and<br>\
a hare is like بُرُوكٌ in the case of a camel: (Msb:)<br>\
or in the case of a bird it is like جُلُوسٌ in the case of a<br>\
man [so that the verb means he sat]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, (K,) aor.<br>\
جَثِمَ, (TA,) said of seed-produce, It<br>\
rose a little from the ground. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also,<br>\
(AHn, K,) aor.<br>\
جَثُمَ, (AHn, TA,) inf. n. جُثُومٌ,<br>\
said of a raceme of a palm-tree, Its unripe, or<br>\
ripening, dates became somewhat large: (AHn,<br>\
K: *) or it became large, and kept its place.<br>\
(T, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, inf. n. جُثُومٌ, said of the night,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  It became half spent. (Th, K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  جَثَمَ<br>\
also signifies He collected clay, or mould, and<br>\
earth, or dust, and ashes. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
جثّم, (S, Mgh,) inf. n. تَجْثِيمٌ, (KL,) [He<br>\
made a bird, and a hare, and the like, to cleave<br>\
to the ground, then to be shot at, or cast at, and<br>\
so killed: see مُجَثَّةٌ:] he kept, or held, a bird<br>\
confined, that it might [be shot at, or cast at,<br>\
and] die: (KL:) he turned an animal on his<br>\
side to be slaughtered. (Golius, as from the KL,<br>\
but not in my copy of that work.)<br>\
5<br>\
تجثّم He (a bird) mounted his female for<br>\
the purpose of copulation. (TA.)<br>\
جَثْمٌ Seed-produce rising a little from the<br>\
ground; as also ↓ جَثَمٌ. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\

ashes, collected. (K.)<br>\
جَثَمَةٌ: see جُثُومٌ.<br>\
جُثَمَةٌ: see جَثَّامَةٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and جُثَامٌ.<br>\
جُثْمَانٌ The body, with the limbs or members;<br>\
syn. جِسْمٌ: and i. q. شَخْصٌ [app. as meaning a<br>\
person; not, as J seems to have held, a corporeal,<br>\
or material, form or thing or substance, such as<br>\
is seen from a distance; see جِسْمٌ]: (K:) or,<br>\
accord. to As, it has the latter meaning, i. q.<br>\
شَخْصٌ; and جُسْمَانٌ has the former meaning,<br>\
that of جِسْمٌ (S, Msb) and جَسَدٌ: (Msb:) or,<br>\
accord. to AZ, جُثْمَانٌ is syn. with جُسْمَانٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) i. e. جَسَدٌ. (S.) One says, مَا أَحْسَنَ<br>\
جُثْمَانَ الرَّجُلِ and جُسْمَانَهُ, meaning [How goodly,<br>\
or beautiful, is] the body, or person, of the man !<br>\
(AZ, S.) J cites, as an ex. of this word in the<br>\
sense of شخص, from a verse of Bishr,<br>\
سَنَامٌ كَجُثْمَانِ البَنِيِّةِ أَتْلَعَا<br>\
observing that by البنيّة is meant the Kaabeh:<br>\
but IB says that the right reading, as found in<br>\
his poetry, is البَلِيَّةِ, and أَتْلَعُ; and that the meaning is, A [long] hump like the جثمان [or body]<br>\
of the she-camel that is placed [and confined<br>\
without food or water until she dies] at the grave<br>\
of a dead man. (TA.) One says also, جَآءَنَا بِثَرِيدٍ<br>\
كَجُثْمَانِ المَآءِ [He brought us crumbled bread<br>\
moistened with broth and piled up, like the body<br>\
of the bird of the kind called قَطًا]. (S.)<br>\
جُثْمَانِيَّةُ المَآءِ, as used in the saying of ElFarajeeyeh, (K,) so in the copies of the K, [or<br>\
El-Faraheeyeh, accord. to the CK,] but correctly<br>\
of El-Farezdak, (TA,)<br>\
وَبَاتَتْ بِجُثْمَانِيَّةِ المَآءِ نِيبُهَا<br>\
إِلَى ذَاتِ رَحْلٍ كَالْمَآتِمِ حُسَّرَا<br>\
means The water itself: or the middle thereof:<br>\
or the place where it collected. (K TA.) [The<br>\
poet says, And her aged she-camels passed the<br>\
night in the water, &amp;c., . . . . like the companies<br>\
of mourning women having the head, or the face,<br>\
&amp;c., uncovered: but what is meant by الي ذات<br>\
رحل, unless it be with one having a saddle upon<br>\
her, إِلَى being sometimes used in the sense<br>\
of مَعَ I am unable to conjecture. In the CK,<br>\
نَيْبَها and كالمٰاثِمِ are erroneously put for نِيبُهَا<br>\
and كَالمَآتِمِ.]<br>\

TA,) inf. n. جَثْوٌ and جُثُوٌ, (TA,) he stood upon<br>\
the extremities of his toes; (K;) like جَذَا; from<br>\
which AO reckons it to be formed by substitution<br>\

[They shall become, on the day of resurrection,<br>\
a company, or congregated body, each people<br>\

sitting upon their knees]; (S, Msb;) like as you<br>\
say جَلَسَ جُلُوسًا and قَوْمٌ جُلُوسٌ. (S.) And<br>\
hence, in the Kur [xix. 73], وَنَذَرُ الظَّالِمِينَ فِيهَا<br>\
جُثِيًّا, and جِثِيًّا also, with kesr to the ج because<br>\
of the kesr of the letter following it, [And we<br>\
