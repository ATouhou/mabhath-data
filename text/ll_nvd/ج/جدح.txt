جَدَحَ, aor.<br>\
جَدَحَ, inf. n. جَدْحٌ, He mixed anything. (L.) جَدَحَ السَّوِيقُ, (S, A, Mgh, L, K,)<br>\
وَنَحْوَهُ, aor. and inf. n. as above; and ↓ جدّحهُ,<br>\
inf. n. تَجْدِيحٌ; (L;) and ↓ اجتدحهُ, (S, L, K,)<br>\
and ↓ اجدحهُ; (K;) He stirred about the سويق<br>\
[or meal made of parched barley or wheat], and<br>\
the like, with water, [or milk, (see what follows,)<br>\
or clarified butter, or fat of a sheep&#39;s tail, &amp;c.,<br>\
(see لَتَّ,)] until the whole became of a uniform<br>\
consistence: (L:) or he stirred it about with a<br>\
مِجْدَح: (A, L:) or he stirred about the سويق<br>\
in milk, and the like, with a مجدح, until it<br>\
became mixed: (Lth, TA:) or he beat and mixed<br>\
the سويق with a مجدح: (Mgh:) i. q. لَتَّهُ:<br>\
(S, K:) and ↓ جدّحهُ, inf. n. تَجْدِيحٌ, he mixed<br>\
it; in the K, لَطَخَهُ; but the right reading is<br>\
خَلَطَهُ, as in the L and other lexicons: (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ اجتدحهُ he drank it (شربه [but this is perhaps a mistranscription for ضَرَبَهُ he beat it]) with<br>\
the مجدح. (L, TA.)<br>\

المُجْدَحُ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
مِجْدَحٌ The instrument with which سَوِيق is<br>\
stirred about with water &amp;c.; (S, A, K, &amp;c.;)<br>\
which is a piece of wood the end whereof has<br>\
several sides; (S, L;) or a piece of wood at the<br>\
head of which are two cross pieces of wood; (A,<br>\
Mgh, L;) and sometimes having three prongs:<br>\
(IAth, TA:) pl. مَجَادِحُ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is sometimes used tropically, as relating to evil, or<br>\
mischief. (L.) [Thus it means (tropical:)  A stirrer-up<br>\
of evil or mischief; or a thing that stirs up, or<br>\
whereby one stirs up, evil or mischief.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Any one of the مَجَادِيحُ السَّمَآءِ [or stirrers-up<br>\
of the sky, or of rain]; (L;) these being the<br>\
أَنْوَآءٌ [or stars, or asterisms, which, by their<br>\
auroral settings or risings, were believed by the<br>\
Pagan Arabs to bring rain &amp;c.]; (S, L, K;)<br>\
of those انواء that seldom or never failed [to bring<br>\
rain], accord. to the Arabs: (Mgh:) the ى in<br>\
the pl. is added to give fulness to the sound of<br>\
the kesreh; for the regular pl. is مَجَادِحُ, and<br>\
the sing. of مجاديح should by rule be مِجْدَاحٌ.<br>\
(A, IAth, Mgh.) One says, ارْسَلَتِ السَّمَآءَ مَجَادِيحُهَا<br>\
(L) or مَجَادِيحُ الغَيْثِ (A) (assumed tropical:)  [Its stirrers-up, or<br>\
the stirrers-up of rain, or the stars or asterisms<br>\
which were the bringers of it, sent forth rain].<br>\
It is related of &#39;Omar, that he ascended the<br>\
pulpit to pray for rain, and, having only offered<br>\
a prayer for forgiveness, descended; whereupon<br>\
it was said to him, “Thou hast not prayed for<br>\
rain; ” and he replied, لَقَدِ اسْتَسْقَيْتُ بِمَجَادِيحِ<br>\
السَّمَآءِ (assumed tropical:) [I have indeed prayed for rain by words<br>\
which are the stirrers-up of rain]; making the<br>\
prayer for forgiveness to be a prayer for rain, in<br>\
allusion to a passage in the Kur, lxxi. 9 and 10;<br>\
and meaning thereby to deny the efficacy of the<br>\
انواء. (A, * Mgh, * L.) المِجْدَحُ, also pronounced<br>\
↓ المُجْدَحُ, (S, K,) thus pronounced by El-Umawee, (S,) is moreover the name of (assumed tropical:) A particular<br>\
star or asterism, one of those which the Pagan<br>\
Arabs asserted to be bringers of rain: (L:) said<br>\
to be الدَّبَرَانُ [the Hyades; or the five chief stars<br>\
thereof; or  the brightest star thereof, a of<br>\
Taurus]; (S, A, L, K;) [which is called by this<br>\
name of الدبران] because it rises latterly [with<br>\
respect to the Pleiades], (S,) or because it follows<br>\
(يَدْبُرُ, i. e. يَتْبَعُ,) the Pleiades: (T in art. دبر:)<br>\
[whence] it is also called حَادِى النُّجُومِ [“ the<br>\
urger of the stars,” properly, “with singing ”],<br>\
(S,) or حَادِى النَّجْمِ [“ the urger of the asterism,”<br>\
meaning, “of the Pleiades ”], and تَالِى النَّجْمِ<br>\
[“ the follower of the asterism,” or, “of the<br>\
Pleiades ”], (Kzw,) and التَّالِى and التَّابِعُ [“ the<br>\
follower ”]: (Sh:) or it is a small star or asterism,<br>\
between الدبران and الثُّرَيَّا [or the Pleiades]:<br>\
(IAar, K:) [perhaps meaning the four stars that<br>\
are the chief stars of the Hyades exclusively of<br>\
a Tauri:] or three stars, (Mgh, TA,) like the<br>\
three stones upon which a cooking-pot rests, (TA,)<br>\
likened to a three-pronged مِجْدَح; (Mgh, TA;)<br>\
on the [auroral] rising of which, heat is expected:<br>\
(TA:) the Arabs regarded it as one of the انواء<br>\
which [by their auroral setting] foretokened<br>\
rain. (IAth.) المِجْدَحَانِ is a name by which<br>\
some of the Arabs called (assumed tropical:) The two wings of<br>\
الجَوْزَآء [or Orion]. (Sh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  مِجْدَحٌ also<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:) A certain mark made with a hot iron<br>\
upon the thighs of camels. (K.)<br>\
مُجَدَّحٌ Beverage, or wine, (شَرَاب,) stirred<br>\
about: (S, K:) and in like manner, blood, when<br>\
it is stirred about in the body of a gored animal<br>\
by the goring horn. (L.)<br>\
مَجْدُوحٌ Blood drawn from a vein, used in<br>\
times of dearth, or drought, (S, K,) in the Time<br>\
of Ignorance: (S:) or blood which was mixed<br>\
with something else, and eaten in times of dearth:<br>\
(TA:) or a kind of food of the Pagan Arabs,<br>\
being blood obtained by opening a vein of a she-camel, which blood was received in a vessel, and<br>\
drunk. (T, TA.)<br>\
