جَعْبَةٌ A كِنَانَة [or quiver] (A, K) for arrows<br>\
(S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) of the kind called نُشَّاب<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K) and for those that are called نَبْل<br>\
also: (Ham p. 154:) but some make a distinction between جَعْبَةٌ and كِنَانَةٌ: the former, they<br>\
say, is for نشّاب; and the latter, for نبل: (Mz,<br>\
MF:) accord. to IDrd, the كنانة is only for نبل,<br>\
and is of leather: that which is of wood is called<br>\
جَفِير: and that which is of two pieces [of wood]<br>\
joined together is called قرن [i. e. قَرَنٌ]: (Ham<br>\
ubi suprà:) accord. to ISh, the جعبة is round<br>\
and wide, with a cover on the top, over its mouth:<br>\
the وَفْضَة is smaller, and its upper and lower parts<br>\
are of equal size; whereas the جعبة is wide in<br>\
its upper part, and contracted in its lower part;<br>\
wide in its upper part that the feathers of the<br>\
arrows [having ample room] may not become<br>\
detached; for the arrows are put in the quiver<br>\
with the points downwards: each of these two<br>\
kinds is made of two corresponding pieces of<br>\
wood: (TA:) the pl. is جِعَابٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and<br>\
جَعَبَاتٌ. (Msb.) You say, نَكَبُوا الجِعَابَ وَسَكَبُوا<br>\
النُّشَّابَ [They inverted, or inclined, the quivers,<br>\
and poured forth the arrows]. (A, TA.) And<br>\
مَعَهُ جَعْبَةٌ فِيهَا بَنَاتُ المَوْتِ [With him is a quiver<br>\
in which are the daughters of death; i. e., deadly<br>\
arrows]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The largest of drinking-vessels. (MF, TA.)<br>\
جُعْبُوبٌ A man (S) short, and ugly, or contemptible; or ugly, and small in body: (S, K:)<br>\
or weak, and destitute of good: or vile, or mean,<br>\
and despicable: (K:) or a low, mean, or sordid,<br>\
and weak man: pl. جَعَابِيبُ. (TA.)<br>\
جِعَابَةٌ The art of making quivers of the kind<br>\
called جِعَاب, pl. of جَعْبَةٌ. (A, K.)<br>\
جِعَابِىٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
جَعَّابٌ [and app. ↓ جِعَابِىٌّ also, as seems to be<br>\
indicated in the K, where it is mentioned as a<br>\
surname, but in the CK written جَعّابىّ,] A maker<br>\
of quivers of the kind called جِعَاب. (A, K.)<br>\
مِجْعَبٌ One who often prostrates, or throws<br>\
down, others, (صِرِّيعٌ, [in some copies of the K,<br>\
erroneously, صَرِيع,]) but is not himself prostrated,<br>\
or thrown down. (K, TA.)<br>\
