جَرُ3َ, (S, A, Msb,) inf. n. جَرٌّ; (S K;)<br>\

اِجْتِرَارٌ; (S, L, K;) and ↓ اِجدرّ, inf. n. اِجْدِرَارٌ; (L, K;)<br>\

(Msb.) You say, جَرُّوا أَذْيَالَهُمْ They dragged<br>\
along their hinder skirts. (A.) And الرُّمْحَ ↓ اجارّ<br>\
He dragged, or drew along, the spear. (TA.)<br>\
And الحَدِيثَ مِنْ أَبَاعِدِ أَطْرَافِهِ ↓ فُلَانٌ يَسْتَجِرُّ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Such a one draws forth talk, or discourse, or<br>\

camels gently, they eating the while. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence,] ↓ هَلُمَّ جَرًّا (tropical:)  At thine ease. (TA.) ElMundhiree explains هَلهمَّ جُرُّوا as meaning (tropical:)  Come<br>\
ye at your ease; from الجَرُّ in driving camels and<br>\

الجَرُّ meaning the act of “ dragging,” &amp;c.: (TA:)<br>\
or from  أَجْرَرْتُهُ الدَّيْنَ, or from أَجْرَرْتُهُ الرُّمْحَ.<br>\
(Msb.) جرّا is here in the accus. case as an inf. n.,<br>\

whether this expression be classical or postclassical. (TA.) [See also art. هلم] ―<br>\
-b4-  جَرَّ الأَثَرَ,<br>\

for which he should be punished, or an injurious<br>\
action, (S, Msb, K, *) against (عَلِى [and إِلَى, as<br>\

to him on the condition that he should not inflict<br>\
an injury, meaning a punishment, upon him but<br>\
for an offence committed by himself;] i. e., that<br>\
he should not be punished for the crime of<br>\
another, of his children or parent or family.<br>\

i. q. خَفَضَ, q. v.:] الجَرُّ is used in the conventional language of the Basrees; and الخَفْضُ, in<br>\

covered, and then went beyond it some days without<br>\
bringing forth: (S, TA:) or withheld her fœtus<br>\
in her womb after the completion of the year, a<br>\
month, or two months, or forty days only: (K, *<br>\
TA:) Th says that she sometimes withholds her<br>\
fœtus [beyond the usual time] a month. (TA.<br>\
[See also جَرَّتْ.]) (tropical:)  She (a mare) exceeded eleven<br>\
months and did not foal: (K, TA:) the more<br>\
she exceeds the usual term, the stronger is her<br>\
foal; and the longest time of excess after eleven<br>\
months is fifteen nights: accord. to AO, the time<br>\
of a mare&#39;s gestation, after she has ceased to be<br>\
covered, to the time of her foaling, is eleven<br>\
months; and if she exceed that time at all, they<br>\
say of her, اللَّيْلَةُ. (TA.) (tropical:)  She (a woman) went<br>\

-b4-<br>\
جَرَّ النَّوْءُ بِالمَكَانِ (assumed tropical:)  The نوء [or auroral setting or<br>\

place to another: (TA:) or i. q. جَانَاهُ, (so in<br>\
copies of the K,) meaning, he committed a crime<br>\
against him: (TK:) or حَابَاهُ. (TA, as from the<br>\
K. [But this seems to be a mistranscription.])<br>\
It is said in a trad., لَا تُجَارّ أَخَاكَ وَلَا تُشَارِّهِ, i. e.<br>\
Delay not, or defer not, with thy brother, &amp;c.:<br>\
[and do not act towards him in an evil, or<br>\
inimical, manner; or do not evil to him, obliging<br>\
him to do the like in return; or do not contend,<br>\
or dispute, with him:] or bring not an injury<br>\
upon him: but accord. to one reading, it is<br>\
لَا تُجَارِهِ, without teshdeed, from الجَرْىBُ, and<br>\
meaning, contend not with him for superiority.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اجرّهُ He pierced him with the spear and left<br>\
it in him so that he dragged it along: (S, K:) or<br>\
so اجرّهُ الرُّمْحَ: (A, Msb:) as though [meaning]<br>\
he made him to drag along the spear. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
He put the جَرِير, i. e. the rope, upon his neck.<br>\
(Har p. 308.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اجرّهُ جَرِيرَهُ [lit. He made him<br>\
to drag along his rope; meaning,] (tropical:)  he left him<br>\
to pasture by himself, where he pleased: a prov.<br>\
(L.) And اجرّهُ رَسَنَهُ [lit. He made him to drag<br>\

-b6-  اجرّ<br>\
لِسَانَ الفَصِيلِ, (S,) or اجرّ الفَصِيلَ, (As, K, *) inf. n.<br>\

جَرٌّ; (K;) (tropical:)  He slit the tongue of the young<br>\
weaned camel, that it might not suck the teat: (S,<br>\
K, TA:) or إِجْرَارُ الفَصِيلِ signifies (tropical:)  the slitting<br>\
the tongue of the young weaned camel, and tying<br>\
upon it a piece of stick, that it may not suck the<br>\
teat; because it drags along the piece of stick<br>\
with its tongue: or الإِجْرَارُ is like التَّفْلِيكُ, signifying (assumed tropical:)  a pastor&#39;s making, of coarse hair, a thing<br>\
like the whirl, or hemispherical head, of a spindle,<br>\
and then boring the tongue of the [young] camel,<br>\
and inserting it therein, that it may not suck the<br>\
teat: so say some: (ISk, TA:) the animal upon<br>\
which the operation has been performed is said to<br>\
be ↓ مَجْرُورٌ and ↓ مُجَرٌّ. (TA.) [But sometimes<br>\
↓ جَرَّ signifies merely He drew away a young<br>\
camel from its mother: see خَلِيَّةٌ voce خَلِىٌّ, in<br>\
three places.] ―<br>\
-b7-  Hence, اجرّ لِسَانَهُ (tropical:)  He prevented<br>\
him from speaking. (A.) &#39;Amr Ibn-MaadeeKerib Ez-Zubeydee says,<br>\

نَطَقْتُ وَلٰكِنَّ الرِّمَاحَ أجَرَّتِ<br>\
[And if the spears of my people had made me<br>\
to speak, I had spoken; but the spears have prevented speech]: i. e., had they fought, and shown<br>\
their valour, I had mentioned that, and gloried in<br>\
it, (S,) or in them; (TA;) but their spears have<br>\
prevented my tongue from speaking, by their<br>\
flight. (S, * TA.)<br>\
-A2-  اجرّ as an intrans. verb:<br>\
see 8. ―<br>\
-b2-  اجرّت البِئْرُ (tropical:)  The well was, or became,<br>\
such as is termed جَرُور. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA.)<br>\

made him to have authority and power over me,<br>\
(K, TA,) and submitted myself, or became submissive or tractable, to him; (A, K, TA;) as<br>\
though I became to him one that was dragged,<br>\
or drawn along. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  استجرّ عَنِ الرَّضَاعِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He (a young camel) refrained from sucking in<br>\
consequence of a purulent pustule, or an ulcer, in<br>\
his mouth or some other part. (TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
جَرْجَرَ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. جَرْجَرَةٌ,<br>\
(S, * K, * TA,) He (a stallion-camel) reiterated<br>\
his voice, or cry, (S, * Mgh, Msb, K, *) or his<br>\
braying, (TA,) in his windpipe. (S, * Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  He, or it, made, or uttered, a noise,<br>\
sound, cry, or cries; he cried out; vociferated;<br>\
raised a cry, or clamour. (TA.) It (beverage,<br>\

(K, TA,) in the fauces. (TA.) And جَرْجَرَتِ النَّارُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The fire sounded, or made a sound or sounds.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (A, Msb,) inf. n. as above, (K,)<br>\
He poured water down his throat; as also<br>\
↓ تَجَرْجَرَ: (K:) or he swallowed it in consecutive<br>\
gulps, so that it sounded, or made a sound or<br>\
sounds; (A, Msb, TA;) as also ↓ the latter verb.<br>\
(K, * TA.) It is said in a trad., (of him who<br>\
drinks from a vessel of gold or silver, Mgh, TA,)<br>\
يُجَرْجِرُ فِى بَطْنِهِ نَارَ جَهَنَّمَ He shall drink down<br>\
into his belly the fire of Hell (Az, A, Mgh, Msb)<br>\
in consecutive gulps, so that it shall make a<br>\
sound or sounds: (A:) or he shall make the fire<br>\
of Hell to gurgle reiteratedly in his belly; from<br>\
جَرْجَرَ said of a stallion-camel. (Mgh.) Most<br>\
read النارَ, as above; but accord. to one reading,<br>\
it is النارُ, (Z, Msb,) and the meaning is, (tropical:)  The<br>\
fire of Hell shall produce sounds in his belly<br>\
like those which a camel makes in his windpipe:<br>\
the verb is here tropically used; and is masc.,<br>\
with ى, because of the separation between it and<br>\
النار: (Z, TA:) but this reading and explanation<br>\
are not right. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also, جَرْجَرَهُ المَآءَ<br>\
He poured water down his throat so that it made<br>\
a sound or sounds. (K, * TA.)<br>\

جَرٌّ (tropical:)  The foot, bottom, base, or lowest part, of<br>\
a mountain; (S, A, K;) like ذَيْلٌ: (A, TA:) or<br>\
the place where it rises from the plain to the<br>\
rugged part: (IDrd, TA:) or الجّرُّ أَصْلُ الجَبَلِ<br>\
is a mistranscription of Fr, and is correctly<br>\
الجُرَاصِلُ الجَبَلُ [i. e. جُراصِلٌ signifies “a mountain”]: (K:) but جُرَاصِلٌ is not mentioned [elsewhere] in the K, nor by any one of the writers<br>\
on strange words; and [SM says,] there is evidently no mistranscription: جَرُّ الجَبَلِ occurs in a<br>\
trad., meaning the foot, &amp;c., of the mountain:<br>\
and its pl. is جِرَارٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  هَلْمَّ جَرًّا: see 1.<br>\

(T, IDrd, * S, * K: *) or anything made of clay:<br>\
(Mgh:) dim. جُرَيْرَةٌ: (TA:) pl. جِرَارٌ (T, S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K) and جَرَّاتٌ (Msb) and ↓ جَرٌّ, (T, S, Msb,<br>\
K,) [or this last is rather a coll. gen. n., signifying pottery, or jars, &amp;c.,] like تَمْرٌ in relation<br>\
to تَمْرَةٌ; or, accord. to some, this is a dial. var.<br>\
of جَرَّةٌ. (Msb.) Beverage of the kind called<br>\
نَبِيذ made in such a vessel is forbidden in a trad.:<br>\
(Mgh, TA:) but accord. to IAth, the trad. means<br>\
a vessel of this kind glazed within, because the<br>\
beverage acquires strength, and ferments, more<br>\
quickly in a glazed earthen vessel. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also جِرَّةٌ:<br>\
-A3-  and see what here next follows.<br>\

wood, (K,) or a piece of wood about a cubit long,<br>\
(S,) having a snare at the head, (S, K,) and a<br>\
cord at the middle, (S,) with which gazelles are<br>\
caught: (S, K:) when the gazelle is caught in<br>\
it, he strives with it awhile, and struggles in it,<br>\
and labours at it, to escape; and when it has<br>\
overcome him, and he is wearied by it, he<br>\
becomes still, and remains in it; and this is<br>\
what is termed [in a prov. mentioned below] his<br>\
becoming at peace with it: (S, * TA:) or it is<br>\
a staff, or stick, tied to a snare, which is hidden<br>\
in the earth, for catching the gazelle; having<br>\
cords of sinew; when his fore leg enters the<br>\
snare, the cords of sinew become tied in knots<br>\
upon that leg; and when he leaps to escape, and<br>\
stretches out his fore leg, he strikes with that<br>\
staff, or stick, his other fore leg and his hind leg,<br>\
and breaks them. (AHeyth, TA.) نَاوَصَ الجُرَّةَ ثُمَّ<br>\
سَالَمَهَا He struggled with the جرّة and then became<br>\
at peace with it [see above] is a prov. applied to<br>\
him who opposes the counsel, or opinion, of a<br>\
people, and then is obliged to agree: (S, * TA:)<br>\
or to him who falls into a case, and struggles in<br>\
it, and then becomes still. (TA.) And it is said<br>\
in another prov., هُوَ كَالبَاحِثِ عَنِ الجُرَّةِ [He is<br>\
like him who searches in the earth for the].<br>\
(AHeyth, TA.) In the phrase  إِذَا أَفْلَتَتْ مِنْ جُرَّتَيْهَا ,<br>\
in a saying of Ibn-Lisán-el-Hummarah, referring<br>\
to sheep, [app. meaning When they escape from<br>\
their two states of danger,] by جرّتيها he means<br>\
their place of pasture (المَجَرّ) in a severe season<br>\
[when they are liable to perish], and when they<br>\
are scattered, or dispersed, by night, and [liable<br>\
to be] attacked, or destroyed, by the beasts of<br>\
prey: so says ISk: Az says that he calls their<br>\
مجر two snares, into which they might fall, and<br>\
perish. (TA.)<br>\
جِرَّةٌ A mode, or manner, of dragging, drawing,<br>\
pulling, tugging, straining, or stretching. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  The stomach of the camel, and of a clovenhoofed animal: this is the primary signification:<br>\
by extension of its meaning, it has the signification next following. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The cud which a<br>\
camel [or cloven-hoofed animal] ejects from its<br>\
stomach, (Az, S, * IAth, Mgh, Msb, K, *) and eats<br>\
again, (K,) or chews, or ruminates, (Az, IAth,<br>\
Msb,) or to chew, or ruminate; (S;) as also<br>\
↓ جَرَّةٌ: (K:) it is said to belong to the same<br>\
predicament as بَعْر. (Mgh.) Hence the saying,<br>\
لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ مَا اخْتَلَفَتِ الدِّرَّةُ وَالجِرَّةُ I will not<br>\
do that as long as the flow of milk and the cud go<br>\
[the former] downwards and [the latter] upwards.<br>\
(S, A. * [See also دِرَّةٌ.]) And اُجْتُلِبَتِ الدِّرَّةُ بِالجِرَّةِ<br>\
[The flow of milk was procured by the cud]:<br>\
alluding to the beasts&#39; becoming full of food, and<br>\
then lying down and not ceasing to ruminate<br>\
until the time of milking. (IAar, TA.) And<br>\
لَا يَحْنَقُ عَلَى جِرَّتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He will not bear rancour,<br>\
or malice, against his subjects:: or, as some say,<br>\
cross he will not conceal a secret: (TA:) and مَا<br>\
يَحْنَقُ عَلَى جِرَّةٍ and مَا يَكْظِمُ على جِرَّةٍ (assumed tropical:)  he does<br>\
not speak when affected with rancour, or malice:<br>\
(TA in art. حنق:) [or the last has the contr. signification: for] لَا يَكْظِمُ عَلَى جِرَّتِهِ means (tropical:)  he will<br>\
not be silent respecting that which is in his bosom,<br>\
but will speak of it. (TA in art. كظم.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
The mouthful with which the camel diverts and<br>\
occupies himself until the time when his fodder<br>\
is brought to him. (K.)<br>\
جَرُورٌ (tropical:)  A female that exceeds the [usual] time<br>\
of pregnancy. (A.) (tropical:)  A she-camel that withholds her fœtus in her womb, after the completion<br>\
of the year, a month, or two months, or forty<br>\
days only; (K, * TA;) or, three months after<br>\
the year: they are the most generous of camels<br>\
that do so: none do so but those that usually<br>\
bring forth in the season called الرَّبِيع (المَرَابِيع);<br>\
not those that usually bring forth in the season<br>\
called الصَّيْف (المَصَايِيف): and only those do so<br>\
that are red [or brown], and such as are of a<br>\
white hue intermixed with red (الصُّهْب), and<br>\
such as are ash-coloured: never, or scarcely ever,<br>\
such as are of a dark gray colour without any<br>\
admixture of white, because of the thickness of<br>\
their skins, and the narrowness of their insides,<br>\
and the hardness of their flesh. (IAar, TA. [See<br>\
also 1: and see خَصُوفٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  A she-camel<br>\
that is made to incline to, and to suckle, a young<br>\
one not her own; her own being about to die,<br>\
they bound its fore legs to its neck, and put upon<br>\
it a piece of rag, in order that she might know<br>\
this piece of rag, which they then put upon<br>\
another young one; after which they stopped up<br>\
her nostrils, and did not unclose them until the<br>\
latter young one had sucked her, and she perceived<br>\
from it the odour of her milk. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also,<br>\
applied to a horse, (S, A, K,) and a camel, (K,)<br>\
(tropical:)  That refuses to be led; refractory: (S, A, K:)<br>\
of the measure فَعُولٌ in the sense of the measure<br>\
مَفْعُولٌ; or it may be in the sense of the measure<br>\
فَاعِلٌ: (Az, TA:) or a slow horse, either from<br>\
fatigue or from shortness of step: (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
TA:) pl. جُرُرٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  A woman crippled; or affected by a disease that deprives her<br>\
of the power of walking: (Sh, K:) because she<br>\
