حِصْنٌ: (M, IB, TA:) or [a building] resembling<br>\
a حِصْن: (M:) an arabicized word, (Lth, JK,<br>\
S, M,) from the Persian كُوشْك: (TA:) its<br>\
primary meaning is a حِصْن in a state of demolition; and a ruined قَصْر: pl. جَوَاسِقُ and جَوَاسِيقُ;<br>\
the latter formed by giving fulness of sound to<br>\
the kesreh, or by poetic license. (Ham ubi<br>\
suprà.) There were, in the Karáfeh, [the great<br>\
burial-ground of the Egyptian metropolis,] numerous قُصُور, i. e., what are called جواسق, having<br>\
belvederes (مَنَاظِر) and gardens: but most of<br>\
the جواسق were without gardens and without a<br>\
well; being lofty belvederes: all of them were<br>\
called قُصُور. (El-Makreezee&#39;s “ Khitat,” ii. 453.)<br>\
