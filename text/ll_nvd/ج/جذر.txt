انجذر It became cut, or cut off, or severed.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
جَذْرٌ (As, IAar, S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ جِذْرٌ (AA,<br>\
S, K) The root, or lower part, (As, S, A, Msb, K,)<br>\
of anything: (As, S, A:) or (so in the K, but in<br>\
other lexicons “ and ”) particularly, of the tongue:<br>\
(Sh, A, Msb, K:) and of the penis: (Sh, K:)<br>\
and of a horn (S, * A) of a cow (S) or of a bull;<br>\
(A;) or the horn [itself] of a cow: (TA:) and<br>\
the latter word, the root, or foot, or lowest part,<br>\
of a tree: (TA:) and the former word, the base<br>\
of the neck: (El-Hejeree, K:) pl. جُذُورٌ. (K.)<br>\
Hence, نَزَلَتِ المَحَبَّةُ فِى جَذْرِ قَلْبِهِ Love took up<br>\
its abode in the bottom (أَصْل) of his heart. (A.)<br>\
And [hence] it is said in a trad., إِنَّ الأَمَانَةَ نَزَلَتْ<br>\
فِى جَذْرِ قُلُوبِ الرِّجَالِ [app. meaning, Verily<br>\
reason, or intellect, or rather conscience, each of<br>\
which is a trust committed by God to man, and a<br>\
faculty which renders him responsible for his<br>\
faith and works, (see, in art. امن, an explanation<br>\
of أَمَانَةٌ as used in the Kur xxxiii. 72,) hath taken<br>\
up its abode in the bottom of the hearts of men].<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, both words, The origin, or stock,<br>\
from which one springs. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And the former, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) and the latter, or the<br>\
latter only, (K,) or the former only, (IAar, TA,)<br>\
A root of a number; (A;) an arithmetical root;<br>\
(Mgh, K;) [a square root;] a number that is<br>\
multiplied by itself; (Msb;) as when you say<br>\
that ten multiplied by ten is a hundred; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) and three multiplied by three is nine;<br>\
(A;) in the former of which cases, ten is the<br>\
جذر, (Mgh, Msb,) i. e., the جذر of a hundred;<br>\
(Mgh;) and in the latter, three; (A;) and in<br>\
each case, the [square or] product of the multiplication is called the مَال, (Msb,) or the جُذَآء, (A,)<br>\
or the ↓ مَجذُور: (Mgh:) [pl. of pauc. أجْذَارٌ,<br>\
and of mult. جُذُورٌ.] It is of two kinds, نَاطِقٌ<br>\
[i. e. rational], and أَصَمُّ [i. e. surd, or irrational]:<br>\
the latter known only to God, accord. to a saying<br>\
of &#39;Áïsheh. (Mgh.)<br>\
جِذْرٌ: see جَذْرٌ.<br>\
جُؤْذَرٌ and جُؤْذُرٌ (S, K) and جُوذَرٌ and جَوْذَرٌ and<br>\
جَؤْذَرٌ and ↓ جِيذَرٌ, (K, TA,) the last of which is<br>\
written in some copies of the K [and in the CK]<br>\
جَيْذَرٌ, (TA,) The young one of a wild cow: (S,<br>\
K:) pl. of the first and second, جَآذِرُ. (S.) ISd<br>\
thinks that جَوْدَرٌ and جِيذَرٌ are Arabic, and that<br>\
جُؤْذَرٌ and جُؤْذُرٌ are Persian. (TA.) See also<br>\
مُجْذِرٌ.<br>\
جِيذَرٌ or جَيْذَرٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
مُجْذِرٌ A wild cow having a young one. (ISd,<br>\
K.) Hence we decide that the ء in ↓ جؤذر is<br>\
augmentative; and because it often occurs as an<br>\
augmentative in the second place. (ISd, TA.)<br>\
[In the S it is regarded as a radical.]<br>\
مَجْذُورٌ: see حَذْرٌ.<br>\
