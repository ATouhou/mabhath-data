forehead, and on the left thereof: so say Az and<br>\
IF and others: the forehead (الجَبْتَة) is between<br>\
the جَبِينَانِ: (Msb:) or the جَبِينَانِ are the two<br>\
borders of the forehead, on either side thereof, in<br>\
the part between the two eyebrows (فِيمَا بَيْنَ<br>\
الحَاجِبَيْنِ [so in the copies of the K, a mistake<br>\

sometimes occurs as meaning the forehead: (MF,<br>\
TA:) [see an ex. voce تَرِبَ, where it is used in<br>\

-b2-  A burial-ground: (K:)<br>\
this is sometimes called جبّانة because the place<br>\
of prayer is generally in the burial-ground:<br>\

sense, are from الجَبُّ and الجَبُوبُ; but others<br>\
derive them from جبن. (TA in art. جب.) ―<br>\

tract abounding with trees: and sometimes the<br>\
جبّانة is level, without hills and without any tract<br>\
abounding with trees; but it is not in sand nor in<br>\
mountains, though it may be in [high grounds<br>\
such as are termed] قِفَاف [pl. of قُفٌّ] and in<br>\

are a cause of cowardice and a cause of niggardliness]; because one loves continuance of life, and<br>\
property, on account of them. (S, TA.)<br>\
