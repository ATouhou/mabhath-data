signifies he, or it, made, or prepared, for him, or<br>\
gave him, that which should veil him, conceal<br>\
him, &amp;c. : accord. to Er-Rághib, the primary<br>\
signification of جَنٌّ is the veiling, or concealing,<br>\
&amp;c., from the sense. (TA.) And جُنَّ عَنْهُ means<br>\
It (anything) was veiled, concealed, or hidden,<br>\
from him. (K.) ―<br>\

woman, (S,) or a pregnant female, (K,) She concealed [or enveloped in her womb a child, or<br>\

-A2-  جَنَّ, aor.<br>\
جَنِ3َ,<br>\
inf. n. جِنٌّ, It (an embryo, or a fœtus,) was concealed in the womb. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, [inf. n., probably, جِنٌّ and جُنُونٌ and جَنَانٌ, explained<br>\
below,] It (the night) was, or became, dark.<br>\
(Golius on the authority of Ibn-Maaroof.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
جُنَّ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. جُنُونٌ (S, K) and جِنَّةٌ<br>\
(S) and جَنٌّ; (K;) and ↓ اُسْتُجِنٌّ, and ↓ تجنّن,<br>\
and ↓ تجانّ; (K;) He (a man, S) was, or<br>\
became, مَجْنُون [originally signifying possessed<br>\
by a جِنِّىّ, or by جِنّ; possessed by a devil or<br>\
demon; (see Bd li. 39;) and hence meaning<br>\
bereft of reason; or mad, insane, unsound in<br>\
mind or intellect, or wanting therein: the verbs<br>\
may generally be rendered he was, or became,<br>\
possessed; or mad, or insane]. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\

جُنَّ الذُّبَابُ, (S, A, TA,) inf. n. جُنُونٌ, (TA,)<br>\

مَجْنُون [originally signifying possessed by a جِنِّىّ,<br>\
or by جِنّ; and hence generally meaning bereft<br>\
of reason; or mad, insane, unsound in mind or<br>\
intellect, or wanting therein]. (S, Msb, K.) [And<br>\
so, vulgarly, ↓ جنّنهُ, whoever, or whatever, be the<br>\
agent.] ―<br>\
-b2-  ما اجنّهُ [How mad, or insane, &amp;c., is<br>\
he!] is anomalous, (Th, S,) being formed from a<br>\
verb of the pass. form, namely, جُنَّ; (Th, TA;)<br>\
for of the مَضْرُوب one should not say, مَا أَضْرَبَهُ;<br>\
nor of the مَسْلُول should one say, مَا أَسَلَّهُ: (S:)<br>\
Sb says that the verb of wonder is used in this<br>\
case because it denotes want of intellect [which<br>\
admits of degrees]. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  اجنّ also signifies<br>\
وَقَعَ فِى مَجَنَّةٍ [app. meaning He fell into, or<br>\

not being really so. (TA.)<br>\

إِسْتَجْنَ3َ see 8, in two places:<br>\
-A2-  and see also 1.<br>\
-A3-<br>\
اِسْتِجْنَانٌ is also syn. with اِسْتِطْرَابٌ; (S, K;)<br>\
استجنّهُ meaning استطربهُ, i. e. He excited him to<br>\
mirth, joy, gladness, or sport. (TK.)<br>\
جِنٌّ The darkness of night; as also ↓ جُنُونٌ and<br>\
↓ جَنَانُ, (K, TA,) the last [written in the CK جُنان,<br>\
but it is] with fet-h: (TA:) or all signify its<br>\
intense darkness: (TA:) or all, the confusedness<br>\
of the darkness of night: (K:) [all, in these<br>\
senses, are app. inf. ns.: (see 1:)] the last, ↓ جَنَانٌ,<br>\
also signifies night [itself]: (K:) or [so in copies<br>\
of the K, accord. to the TA, but in the CK<br>\
“ and,”] the dense black darkness of night: (S,<br>\
K:) and ↓ جُنُونٌ, the veiling, or concealing, or<br>\
protecting, darkness of night. (ISk, S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Concealment: so in the phrase, لَا جِنَّ بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ<br>\
There is no concealment with this thing. (K, *<br>\
TA.) One of the Hudhalees says,<br>\
وَلَا جِنَّ بِالبَغْضَآءِ وَالنَّظَرِ الشَّزْرِ<br>\
[And there is no concealment with vehement<br>\
hatred and the looking with aversion]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [The genii; and sometimes the angels;] accord. to some, the spiritual beings that are concealed from the senses, or that conceal themselves<br>\
from the senses; all of such beings; (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA;) the opposite of إِنْسٌ; (S, Mgh, Msb, Er-Rághib, TA;) thus comprising the angels; all of<br>\
these being جِنّ; (Er-Rághib, TA;) thus called<br>\
because they are feared but not seen: (S:) or,<br>\
accord. to others, certain of the spiritual beings;<br>\
for the spiritual beings are of three kinds; the<br>\
good being the angels; and the evil being the<br>\
devils (شَيَاطِين); and the middle kind, among<br>\
whom are good and evil, being the جِنّ; as is<br>\
shown by the first twelve verses of ch. lxxii. of<br>\
the Kur: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or it here means<br>\
intelligent invisible bodies, predominantly of the<br>\
fiery, or of the aerial, quality: or a species of<br>\
souls, or spirits, divested of bodies: or human<br>\
souls separate from their bodies: (Bd:) or the<br>\
جِنّ are the angels [exclusively]; (K;) these<br>\
being so called in the Time of Ignorance, because<br>\
they were concealed, or because they concealed<br>\
themselves, from the eyes: so, accord. to some,<br>\
in the Kur [xviii. 48], where it is said that Iblees<br>\
was of the جِنّ: and so, as some say, in the Kur<br>\
[vi. 100], where it is said that they called the<br>\
جِنّ partners of God: (TA:) but some reject the<br>\
explanation in the K, because the angels were<br>\
created of light, and the جِنّ of fire; and the<br>\
former do not propagate their kind, nor are they<br>\
to be described as males and females; contrary to<br>\
the case of the جِنّ; wherefore it is generally<br>\
said that in the phrase [in the Kur xviii. 48,<br>\
above mentioned] إِلَّا إِبْلِيسَ كَانَ مِنَ الجِنِّ, what<br>\
is excepted is disunited in kind from that from<br>\
which the exception is made, or that Iblees had<br>\
adopted the dispositions of the جِنّ: (MF, TA:)<br>\
or, as some say, the جِنّ were a species of the<br>\
angels, who were the guardians of the earth and<br>\
of the gardens of Paradise: (TA:) ↓ جِنَّةٌ, also,<br>\
signifies the same as جِنٌّ: (S, Msb, K:) so in<br>\
the last verse of the Kur: (S:) in the Kur<br>\
xxxvii. 158 meaning the angels, whom certain of<br>\
the Arabs worshipped; (TA;) and whom they<br>\
called the daughters of God: (Fr, TA:) a single<br>\
individual of the جِنّ is called ↓ جِنِّىٌّ, [fem. with<br>\
ة:] (S, TA:) and ↓ جَانٌّ, also, is syn. with جِنٌّ:<br>\
(Msb:) or الجَانٌ means the father of the جِنّ; (S,<br>\
Mgh, TA;) [i. e. any father of جِنّ; for] the pl. is<br>\
جِنَّانٌ, like حِيطَانٌ pl. of حَائِطٌ: (S, TA:) so says<br>\
El-Hasan: it is said in the T, on the authority of<br>\
AA, that the جانّ is, or are, of the جِنّ: (TA:) or<br>\
جَانٌّ is a quasi-pl. n. of جِنٌّ; (M, K;) like جَامِلٌ<br>\
and بَاقِرٌ: (M, TA:) so in the Kur lv. 56 and 74:<br>\
in reading the passage in the Kur lv. 39, &#39;Amr Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Obeyd pronounced it جَأَنٌ: (TA:) it is related<br>\
that there were certain creatures called the جَانّ,<br>\
who were upon the earth, and who acted corruptly<br>\
therein, and shed blood, wherefore God sent angels<br>\
who banished them from the earth; and it is said<br>\
that these angels became the inhabitants of the<br>\
earth after them. (Zj, TA.) بَاتَ فُلَانٌ ضَيْفَ جِنٍّ<br>\
[Such a one passed the night a guest of جنّ]<br>\
means, in a desolate place, in which was no one<br>\
that might cheer him by his society or converse.<br>\
(TA.) The saying of Moosà Ibn-Jábir,<br>\
فَمَا نَفَرَتْ جِنِّى وَلَا فُلَّ مِبْرَدِى<br>\
may mean And my companions, who were like<br>\
the جِنّ, did not flee when I came to them and<br>\
informed them, nor was my tongue, that is like<br>\
the file, deprived of its sharp edge: or by his<br>\
جنّ he means his familiar جنّ, such as were<br>\
asserted to aid poets when difficulties befell them;<br>\
and by his مبرد, his tongue: (Ham p. 182 [where<br>\
other explanations are proposed; but they are<br>\
far-fetched]:) or by his جنّ he means his heart;<br>\
and by his مبرد, his tongue. (S.) The Arabs<br>\
liken a man who is sharp and effective in affairs<br>\
to a جِنِّىّ and a شَيْطَان: and hence they said,<br>\
نَفَرَتْ جِنُّهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He became weak and abject.<br>\
(Ham ubi suprà.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The greater, main, or chief,<br>\
part, or the main body, or bulk, of men, or of<br>\
mankind; as also ↓ جَنَانٌ; (K;) because he<br>\
who enters among them becomes concealed by<br>\
them: (TA:) or the latter means the general<br>\
assemblage, or collective body, of men: (IAar,<br>\
S, * TA:) or what veils, conceals, covers, or protects, one, of a thing. (AA, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  The flowers,<br>\
or blossoms, of plants or herbage. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
(tropical:)  The prime, or first part, of youth: (S, K, TA:)<br>\
or the sharpness, or vigorousness, and briskness,<br>\
liveliness, or sprightliness, thereof. (TA.) You<br>\
say, كَانَ ذٰلِك فِى جِنِّ شَبَابِهِ (tropical:)  That was in the<br>\
prime, or first part, of his youth. (S, TA.) And<br>\
أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ الأَمْرَ بِجِنِّ ذٰلِكَ (tropical:) I will do that thing<br>\
in the time of the first and fresh state of that.<br>\
(S, TA.) جِنٌّ may also signify (assumed tropical:)  The madness,<br>\
or insanity, of exultation, or of excessive exultation. (TA.) And one says, اِتّقِ النّاقَةَ فَإِنّهَا بِجِنِّ<br>\
ضِرَامِهَا, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Fear thou the she-camel, for<br>\
she is in her evil temper on the occasion of her<br>\
bringing forth. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also i. q. جدّ [app.<br>\
جِدٌّ, as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Seriousness, or earnestness];<br>\
because it is a thing that is an accompaniment of<br>\
thought, or reflection, and is concealed by the<br>\
heart. (TA.)<br>\
جَنَّةٌ A [garden, such as is called] بُسْتَان: (S,<br>\
Mgh:) or a garden, or walled garden, (حَدِيقَة,<br>\
Msb, K,) of trees, or of palm-trees, (Msb,) or<br>\
of palms and other trees: (K:) or only if containing palm-trees and grape-vines; otherwise,<br>\
if containing trees, called حديقة: (Aboo-&#39;Alee<br>\
in the Tedhkireh, TA:) or any بستان having<br>\
trees by which the ground is concealed: and sometimes concealing trees: (Er-Rághib, TA:) and<br>\
palm-trees: (S:) or tall palm-trees: (Mgh:) or<br>\
shadowing trees; because of the tangling, or<br>\
luxuriousness of their branches; as though concealing at once what is beneath them: then a<br>\
بستان; because of its dense and shadowing trees:<br>\
(Bd in ii. 23:) or a بستان of palms and other<br>\
trees, dense, and shadowing by the tangling, or<br>\
luxuriousness, and denseness, of their branches;<br>\
as though it were originally the inf. n. of un. of<br>\
جَنَّهُ, and meaning “ a single act of veiling ” or<br>\
“ concealing ” &amp;c.: (Ksh ib.:) then, with the<br>\
article ال, [Paradise,] the abode of recompense;<br>\
because of the جِنَان therein; (Ksh and Bd ib.;)<br>\
or because the various delights prepared therein<br>\
for mankind are concealed in the present state of<br>\
existence: (Bd ib.:) [and] hence الجَنَّاتُ [the<br>\
gardens of Paradise], (so in a copy of the S,) or<br>\
جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ [the gardens of continual abode]: (so<br>\
in another copy of the S:) [for] the pl. of جَنَّةٌ<br>\
is أَجِنَّةٌ (Mgh, Msb, K) and جِنَيْنَة (Msb, TA)<br>\
and جُنَّةٌ, but this last is strange. (MF, TA.)<br>\
[Dim. ↓ جُنَيْنَةٌ, vulgarly pronounced جِنَيْنَة, and<br>\
applied to A garden; as though it were a little<br>\
Paradise.]<br>\
جُنَّةٌ A thing by which a person is veiled, concealed, hidden, covered, or protected: an arm, or<br>\

-b2-  A piece of cloth which<br>\
a woman wears, covering the fore and kind parts<br>\
of her head, but not the middle of it, and covering<br>\
the face, and the two sides of the bosom, (K,) or,<br>\
accord. to the M, the ornaments [حُلِىّ instead of<br>\
جَنْبَى] of the bosom, (TA,) and having two eyeholes, like the بُرْقُع. (K.)<br>\

جَنَنٌ A grave; (S, K;) because it conceals<br>\

-b2-  Grave-clothing; (K;) for the<br>\
same reason. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A garment that conceals<br>\
the body. (TA.) [See also جَنَانٌ.]<br>\

also جَنَنٌ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  The حَرِيم [or surrounding adjuncts,<br>\
or appertenances and conveniences,] (K, TA) of a<br>\
house; because concealing the house. (TA.) ―<br>\
