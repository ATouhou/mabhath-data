[In the TA, جُبَّةُ الرُّمْحِ is also explained as meaning ما دخل من السنان فيه The part of the spearhead that enters into the shaft: but it seems that<br>\
من has been inserted here by a mistake of the<br>\

the part of the spear-shaft into which the head<br>\
enters; though in general the shaft enters into<br>\
the head.] ―<br>\
