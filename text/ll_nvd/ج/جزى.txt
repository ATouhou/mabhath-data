جَزَى, aor<br>\
جَزِىَ (Msb, K,) inf. n. جَزَآءٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
It (a thing) paid; gave, or rendered, as a satisfaction; or made, gave, or rendered, satisfaction:<br>\
(Msb:) or satisfied; sufficed; or contented. (K.)<br>\
And جَزَيْتُ الدَّيْنَ I paid the debt. (Msb.) And<br>\
جَزَيْتُ فُلَانًا حَقَّهُ I paid such a one his right, or<br>\
due. (TA.) And مَا يَجْزِينِى هٰذَا الثَّوْبُ This<br>\
garment does not suffice me. (TA.)―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,<br>\
(TA,) جَزَى عَنْهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) [aor. and]<br>\
inf. n. as above, (Mgh,) It (a thing) paid for<br>\
him; gave, or rendered, [a thing] as a satisfaction<br>\
for him; made, gave, or rendered, satisfaction for<br>\
him; (S, Mgh, Msb,* K;) and some of the lawyers use ↓اجزى in this sense, like اجزأ: (Az,<br>\
Mgh, Msb:) جَزَى is of the dial. of El-Hijáz,<br>\
and اجزأ of the dial. of Temeem. (Akh, Msb.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [ii. 45], لَا تَجْزِى نَفْسٌ عَنْ نَفْسٍ<br>\
شَيْئًا [A soul shall not give anything as a satisfaction for a soul, i. e. for another soul: or a soul<br>\
shall not make satisfaction for a soul at all;<br>\
accord. to the latter rendering, شيئا being put in<br>\
the accus. case after the manner of an inf. n.].<br>\
(S, Msb.) You say also, جَزَتْ عَنْكَ شَاةٌ A sheep,<br>\
or goat, made satisfaction for thee [as a sacrifice];<br>\
(S, TA;) as also ↓أَجْزَتْ: (TA:) Benoo-Temeem<br>\
say أَجْزَأَتْ, with ء: (S, TA:) this last, thus explained, is a dial, var. mentioned by IKtt (Msb.)<br>\
And كَذَا عَنْ كَذَا ↓اجزى Such a thing stood,<br>\
or served, in lieu, in the place, or in stead, of<br>\
such a thing, without sufficing. (Zj, K.) And<br>\
قَلِيلٌ مِنْ كَثِيرٍ↓يُجْزِى; and هٰذَامِنْ هٰذَا; A<br>\
little stands, or serves, in lieu of much; and this,<br>\
of this. (IAar, TA.) And عَنْهُ مُجْزَى ↓ اجزى<br>\
فُلَانٍ and مُجْزَاةَ فُلَانٍ and (as though the augmentative letter [ا in اجزى] were imagined to be<br>\
rejected, TA) مَجْزَى فلان and مَجْزَاةَ فلان He<br>\
satisfied, sufficed, or contented, him as such a<br>\
one; he stood, or served, him in stead of such a<br>\
one; a dial. var. of اجزأ. (K.) And ↓ اجزى<br>\
مُجْزَى غَيْرِهِ It (a thing) satisfied, sufficed, or<br>\
contented, as another thing; it stood, or served,<br>\
in stead of another thing. (Msb.) And ↓اجزاكَ,<br>\
with the [second] objective complement suppressed, It was sufficient for thee. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
جَزَاهَ كَذَا (Msb,* TA,) and جَزَاهُ بِهِ (K,) or<br>\
بِمَا صَنَعَ, (S,) and عَلَيْهِ, (K,) [aor. and] inf. n.<br>\
as above, (S, K,) He repaid, requited, compensated, or recompensed, him (Msb, K TA) [for<br>\
such a thing, for it, or for what he had done];<br>\
as also ↓جازاهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. مُجَازَاةٌ and جِزَآءٌ:<br>\
(K:) or, accord. to Fr, [contr. to many instances<br>\
in the Kur,] the former verb relates only to good;<br>\
and the latter, to good and to evil: but accord.<br>\
to others, the former may relate to good and to<br>\
evil; and the latter, to evil. (TA.) [See also<br>\
جَزَآءٌ, below.] One says, in praying for another,<br>\
جَزَاهُ اللّٰهُ خَيْرًا May God repay him good: and<br>\
requite, or recompense, him for good [that he has<br>\
done]. (Msb.) And بِذَنْبِهِ ↓ جَازَيْتُهُ I punished<br>\
him for his crime, or sin, or act of disobedience.<br>\
(Msb.) And جَزَى عَنْهُ فُلَانًا He requited, compensated, or recompensed, for him, such a one.<br>\
(TA.)―<br>\
-b4-  جَازَيْتُهُ فَجَزَيْتُهُ: see 3.<br>\

-b2-  [جازاهُ خَيْرًا<br>\
He prayed for a reward for him from God: or<br>\
said to him, May God reward thee. (Golius, on<br>\
the authority of Z.) ―<br>\
-b3- جازى بِحَرْفٍ and بِظَرْفٍ,<br>\
He employed a particle, and an adverbial noun,<br>\
as conditional; to denote that, with what follows,<br>\
it expresses a condition with its complement. For<br>\
instance, in the S, voce حَيْثُ, it is said,حَيْثُ مِنَ<br>\
الظُّرُوفِ الَّتِى لَا يُجَازَى بِهَا إِلَّا مَعَ مَا, i. e. حيث is<br>\
one of the adverbial nouns that are not employed<br>\
conditionally, or to denote that, with what follows,<br>\
they express a condition with its complement, unless with ما affixed thereto. See جَزَآءٌ, below.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
↓ جَازَيْتُهُ فَجَزَيْتُهُ [I vied, or contended, with him<br>\
in repaying, requiting, compensating, or recompensing, and] I overcame him [therein]. (S.)<br>\
4<br>\
اجزى: see 1, in seven places.<br>\
-A2-  Also He<br>\
furnished a knife with a handle; a dial. var. of<br>\
اجزأ: (Msb, K:) but ISd doubts its being so.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تجازى دَيْنَهُ, and بِدَيْنِهِ, He demanded payment of his debt. (K.) You say, تَجَازَيْتُ دَيْنِى<br>\
عَلَى فُلَانٍ I demanded payment of my debt [owed<br>\
by such a one]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تَجَازَيا [They two repaid,<br>\

(Er-Rághib, TA;) sometimes a reward, and<br>\
sometimes a punishment: (AHeyth, TA:) [the<br>\
former word is an inf. n.; see 1;] the latter, a<br>\
quasi-inf. n.: جَوَازٍ is pl. of the latter, or of the<br>\
former, or of ↓جَازٍ, accord. to different writers<br>\
explaining the saying of El-Hoteí-ah,<br>\
مَنْ يَفْعَلِ الخَيْرَ لَا يَعْدَمْ جَوَازِيَهُ<br>\

مَجْزًى and مُجْزًى are used as inf. ns. of 4.<br>\
[See 1.] (K.)<br>\
مُجْزٍ [act. part. n. of 4. It is said in the TA<br>\

And that مجزى لِأَمْرِهِ, applied to a man, signifies<br>\
Sufficing for his affair. But مجزى in these<br>\
instances is evidently a mistranscription, for مُجْزٍ;<br>\
and مجازى, for مَجَازٍ, Mistranscriptions of this<br>\
Kind are of frequent occurrence in Lexicons.]<br>\
مَجْزَاةٌ and مُجْزَاةٌ are used as inf. ns. of 4. [See<br>\
