جَرَمَهُ, aor.<br>\
جَرِمَ, (K,) inf. n. جَرْمٌ, (S,) [like<br>\
جَزَمَهُ,] He cut it, or cut it off. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  جَرَمَ<br>\
الشَّاةَ, (K,) or جَرَمَ صُوفَ الشَّاةِ, (S,) inf. n. as<br>\
above, (TA,) He shore, or sheared, or cut off the<br>\
wool of, the sheep. (S, K, * TA.) And جَرَمْتُ مِنْهُ<br>\
I took [or clipped somewhat] from it; [namely,<br>\
the wool;] like جَلَمْتُ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  جَرَمَ النَّخْلَ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) aor. as above, (TA,) inf. n. جَرْمٌ (K)<br>\
and جَرَامٌ and جِرَامٌ, (S, * K,) He cut the palmtrees; (Msb;) [meaning] he cut off the fruit of<br>\
the palm-trees; (S, K;) as also ↓ اجترمهُ: (S:)<br>\
and in like manner, جَرَمَ التَّمْرَ he cut off the<br>\
dates. (TA.) You say, هٰذَا زَمَنُ الجَرَامِ and<br>\
الجِرَامِ, (S,) i. e. [This is] the time of the cutting<br>\
off of the fruit of the palm-trees. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
جَرَمَ النَّخْلَ, inf. n. جَرْمٌ, He computed by conjecture the quantity of fruit upon the palm-trees;<br>\
(K;) and so ↓ اجترمهُ: (Lh, K:) [like جَزَمَهُ and<br>\
اجتزمهُ.]<br>\
-A2-  جَرَمَ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
جَرِمَ, (S,) inf. n. جَرْمٌ,<br>\
(TK,) also signifies He gained, acquired, or<br>\
earned, [wealth, &amp;c.,] (S, K,) لِأَهْلِهِ for his<br>\
family; and so ↓ اجترم. (K.) And you say,<br>\
خَرَجَ يَجْرِمُ لِأَهْلِهِ and يَجْرِمُ أَهْلَهُ, meaning He<br>\
went forth seeking [sustenance], and practising<br>\
skill, or artifice, for his family. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  وَلَا<br>\
يَجْرِمَنَّكُمْ شَنَآنُ قَوْمٍ, in the Kur [v. 3 and 11], is<br>\
explained by some as meaning And let not a<br>\
people&#39;s hatred by any means occasion you. or<br>\
cause you: or it means let not a people&#39;s hatred<br>\
by any means induce you, or incite you. (S, TA.)<br>\
Some read ↓ لا يُجْرِمَنَّكُمْ, with damm to the ى;<br>\
and Zj says that جَرَمْتُ and أَجْرَمْتُ signify the<br>\
same: but some say that the meaning is, let it<br>\
not by any means lead you into crime, or sin;<br>\
أَجْرَمْتُهُ being like آثَمْتُهُ, I led him into sin, &amp;c.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Fr says that the asserting جَرَمْتُ to<br>\
mean حَقَقْتُ [or rather حُقِقْتُ, for this is evidently, I think, the right reading, though I find<br>\
حَقَقْتُ in the TA as well as in a copy of the S, in<br>\
another copy of which I find جَرَمَتْ and حَقَّقَتْ,<br>\
suggesting that the right reading may perhaps be<br>\
جَرَمَتْ and حُقَّتْ,] is nought: they who so explain<br>\
it having been confused in their judgment by the<br>\
saying of the poet Aboo-Asmà, (S, TA,) or, as<br>\
some say, El-Howfazán, (TA,) or, accord. to<br>\
some, &#39;Ateeyeh Ibn-&#39;Ofeyf, (IB, TA,)<br>\
وَلَقَدْ طَعَنْتُ أَبَا عُيَيْنَةَ طَعْنَةً<br>\
جَرَمَتْ فَزَارَةَ بَعْدَهَا أَنْ يَغْضَبُوا<br>\
in which they made فزارة to be in the nom. case,<br>\
as though the meaning were حُقَّ لَهَا الغَضَبُ [it<br>\
was right, or fit, or proper, for it, (the tribe of<br>\
Fezárah,) to be angry; nearly agreeing with an<br>\
explanation of جَرَمَ given by Golius as on the<br>\
authority of Ibn-Maaroof, namely, “meritus, dignus fuit ”]: but, he says, فزارة is in the accus.<br>\
case; the meaning being, جَرَمَتْهُمُ الطَّعْنَةُ أَنْ يَغْضَبُوا<br>\
[which will be found explained, on the authority<br>\
of IB, in what follows]: AO says that the meaning is, أَحَقَّتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الغَضَبَ, i. e., أَحَقَّتِ الطَّعْنَةُ<br>\
فَزَارَةَ أَنْ يَغْضَبُوا, and حَقَّت also, [both having the<br>\
same signification, i. e., the thrust required Fezá-<br>\
rah to be angry,] from لَا جَرَمَ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ كَذَا meaning حَقًّا [Verily I will do thus]: (S, TA:) accord.<br>\
to Fr, the meaning is, كَسَبَتْ فَزَارَةَ الغَضَبَ عَلَيْكَ,<br>\
the right reading being, وَلَقَدْ طَعَنْتَ, with fet-h<br>\
to the ت; [so that the verse means And verily<br>\
thou didst thrust Aboo-&#39;Oyeyneh with a thrust of<br>\
thy spear that occasioned, or caused, Fezárah,<br>\
after it, to be angry against thee:] for he is addressing Kurz El-&#39;Okeylee, bewailing his death;<br>\
and Kurz had thrust Aboo-&#39;Oyeyneh, who was<br>\
Hisn Ibn-Hudheyfeh Ibn-Bedr El-Fezáree. (IB,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And جَرَمَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
جَرِمَ, inf. n.<br>\
جَرْمٌ, (Msb,) He committed a sin, a crime, a<br>\
fault, an offence, or an act of disobedience; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) syn. أَذْنَبَ, (Msb, K,) and اِكْتَسَبَ الإِثْمَ;<br>\
(Msb;) [perhaps because he who does so brings<br>\
upon himself the consequence thereof; as though<br>\
originally جَرَمَ نَفْسَهُ اولِنَفْسِهِ أَثَرَ جُرْمٍ he drew<br>\
upon himself the effect of a sin, &amp;c.; (compare<br>\
كَسَبَ and اِكْتَسَبَ;)] as also ↓ اجرم, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. إِجْرَامٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ اجترم; (S, K;)<br>\
and ↓ تجرّم. (El-&#39;Okberee, Har p. 207.) You<br>\
say, جَرَمَ عَلَيْهِمْ جَرِيمَةً, and إِلَيْهِمْ, (K,) and بِهِمْ,<br>\
used by a poet for عليهم or اليهم, (IAar, TA,) He<br>\
committed against them a crime, or an offence<br>\
for which he should be punished; as also ↓ اجزم.<br>\
(K.) They said also, الذَّنْبَ ↓ اجرم [He committed the sin, or crime, amp;c.]; making the verb<br>\
trans. (TA.) And a poet says,<br>\
وَتَرَى اللَّبِيبَ مُحَسَّدًا لَمْ يَجْتَرِمْ<br>\
عِرْضَ الرِّجَالِ وَعِرْضُهُ مَشْتُومٌ<br>\
[And thou seest the intelligent envied, or much<br>\
envied: he has not injured the honour of men,<br>\
while his honour is reviled]. (Th, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  جَرِمَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
جَرَمَ, (K,) inf. n. جَرَمٌ, (TK,) He (a man, TA)<br>\
betook himself to eating the جُرَامَة [in the CK,<br>\
erroneously, جَرامَة,] of the palm-trees, (AA, K,)<br>\
[i. e., the dates which had fallen in the cutting,<br>\
and] which were among the branches. (AA, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  جَرِمَ, said of a man, also signifies عَظُمَ جُرْمُهُ<br>\
[His sin, or crime, &amp;c., was, or became, great];<br>\
and so جَرُمَ, like كَرُم: [both are thus explained,<br>\
in different places in this art, by the author of<br>\
the TA; and the explanation in the latter case is<br>\
followed by اى اذنب, i. e., he committed a six,<br>\
&amp;c.; probably added by him to show that the<br>\
reading found by him was جُرْمُهُ, not جِرْمُهُ: but<br>\
[think that the right reading is عَظُمَ جِرْمُهُ his<br>\
body became great; and this is confirmed by what<br>\
here follows:] ↓ اجرم explained in the copies of<br>\
the K by عَظُمَ [in the TK عظم يعنى جرمه وجسده]<br>\
should be جَرِمَ, a triliteral; and the meaning is<br>\
عَظُمَ جُرْمُهُ: and in like manner, the three significations here following, assigned in the K to ↓ اجرم,<br>\
belong to جَرِمَ. (TA.)<br>\
-A5-  It (his colour) was, or<br>\
became, clear. (K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He (a man, TA)<br>\
was, or became, clear in his voice. (K, * TA.)<br>\
-A6-<br>\
جَرِمَ بِهِ It (blood) stuck to him, or it: (K, * TA,<br>\
and so in a marginal note in a copy of the S:)<br>\
and in like manner, tar to a camel. (The same<br>\
marginal note.)<br>\
2<br>\
جَرَّمَ [جرّم He cut off vehemently, or much.<br>\
(Golius, on the authority of a gloss in the KL.)]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  جَرَّمْنَا هُمْ, inf. n. تَجْرِيمٌ, We went forth from<br>\
them. (Lth, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  جَرَّمْنَا الشِّتَآءَ We completed<br>\
the winter. (TA.) [See also 5.]<br>\
4<br>\
اجرم التَّمْرُ The dates attained to the time<br>\
for their being cut off. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, in<br>\
six places.<br>\
5<br>\
تجرّم [It became cut off. ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,]<br>\
(tropical:)  It (a year, حَوْلٌ) became completed; (Az, K,<br>\
TA;) as though it became cut off from the preceding year: (Az, TA:) it ended; (S;) and so<br>\
the winter: (TA:) and it (a night) passed away,<br>\
(S, K,) and became completed; (K;) it ended.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  تجرّم ثَمَانِيًا, a phrase used by Sá&#39;ideh<br>\
Ibn-Ju-eiyeh, means He passed eight nights.<br>\
(TA.) [See also 2]<br>\
-A3-  تجرّم عَلَيْهِ He accused<br>\
him of a sin, a crime, a fault, an offence, or an<br>\
act of disobedience, (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, S, K,) which<br>\
he had not committed, (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, S,) or<br>\
though he had not committed any (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
تجرّم He guarded against the commission of sin,<br>\
or crime, &amp;c; like تأثّم. (Har p. 207.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See<br>\
also 1.<br>\
-A4-  Also He called, cried out, shouted, or<br>\
vociferated; from جِرْمٌ meaning صَوْتٌ. (Har<br>\
p. 207. [But see جِرْمٌ.])<br>\
8<br>\
إِجْتَرَمَ see 1, in five places.<br>\
جَرْمٌ Hot; syn. حَرٌّ, (S,) or [rather] حَارٌّ; (K;)<br>\
contr. of صَرْدٌ; (Lth, TA;) a Persian word, (S,)<br>\
arabicized; (S, K;) originally گَرْم. (TA.) You<br>\
say أَرْضٌ جَرْمٌ A warm land: (AHn, TA:) or a<br>\
hot land: (IDrd, TA:) or a vehemently hot<br>\
land: (K:) pl. جُرُومٌ, (AHn, TA,) which, applied to countries, or regions, means the contr. of<br>\
صُرُودٌ. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  A boat (زَوْرَقٌ) of El-Yemen;<br>\
(K;) also called نَقِيرَةٌ: (TA:) pl. as above. (K.)<br>\
[In the dial. of Egypt, The largest kind of Egyptian boat used on the Nile for the conveyance of<br>\
grain and merchandise in general, but used only<br>\
when the river is high, and also in the coastingtrade, and generally carrying from 5,000 to<br>\
15,000 bushels of grain.]<br>\
جُرْمٌ A sin, a crime, a fault, an offence, or an<br>\
act of disobedience, syn. ذَنْبٌ, (S, Msb, * K,)<br>\
whether intentional or committed through inadvertence; (Kull voce إِثْمٌ;) as also ↓ جَرِيمَةٌ; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) and ↓ جَرِمَةٌ: (K:) transgression:<br>\
(TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أَجْرَامٌ and [of mult.] جُرُومٌ,<br>\
(K,) both of جُرْمٌ: the pl. of جَرِيَمةٌ is جَرَائِمُ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also جَرَامٌ.<br>\
-A3-  لَا جُرْمَ: see لَا جَرَمَ.<br>\
جِرْمٌ The body; syn. جَسَدٌ; (S, Msb, K;) or<br>\
بَدَنٌ; (Th, TA;) as also ↓ جِرْمَانٌ: (K:) or the<br>\
أَلْوَاحِ [pl. of لَوْح q. v.] and جُثْمَان [q. v.] of the<br>\
جَسَد: (T, TA:) pl. (of pauc., TA) أجْرَامٌ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) which is also used as a sing., (TA,) and (of<br>\
mult., TA) جُرُومٌ and جُرُمٌ. (K.) أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ أَجْرَامَهُ<br>\
is a phrase mentioned, but not explained, by Lh:<br>\
ISd thinks that it means He threw upon him the<br>\
weight of his body; as though the term جِرْمٌ<br>\
applied to each separate part of his body. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] الأَجْرَامُ الفَلَكِيَّةُ The [heavenly] bodies<br>\
that are above the عَنَاصِر, of the orbs and stars.<br>\
(KT.)<br>\
-A2-  The throat, or fauces; syn. حَلْقٌ. (K.)<br>\
The phrase يَضِيقُ بِهِ الجِرْمُ, used by the poet<br>\
Maan Ibn-&#39;Ows, means (assumed tropical:)  It is a great, or formidable, thing, or matter: [properly,] the throat<br>\
(الحَلْقُ) will not easily swallow it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The<br>\
voice; (S, K;) mentioned by ISk and others;<br>\
(S;) and so explained as used in the phrase<br>\
إِنَّ فُلَانًا لَحَسَنُ الجِرْمِ [Verily such a one is good<br>\
in respect of voice]: (TA:) or highness, or loudness, of the voice: (K, TA:) you say, مَا عَرَفْتُهُ إِلَّا<br>\
بِجِرْمِهِ [I knew him not save by his voice, or his<br>\
highness, or loudness, of voice]: but some disapprove this: (TA:) AHát says that the vulgar are<br>\
addicted to saying, فُلَانٌ صَافِى الجِرْمِ Such a one<br>\
is clear in voice, or in throat: but it is a mistake.<br>\
(S, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Colour. (IAar, S, Msb, K.) One<br>\
may say, of نَجَاسَة [or filth], لَا جِرْمَ لَهَا, meaning<br>\
It has no colour. (Msb.)<br>\
-A4-  الأَجْرَامُ (app. as pl.<br>\
of جِرْمٌ, TA) The utensils, or apparatus, of the<br>\
pastor. (K.)<br>\
لَا جَرَمَ (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and لَا ذَا جَرَمَ, (IAar,<br>\
K,) ذا being here a redundant connective as in<br>\
several other instances, (IAar, TA,) and لَا أَنْ ذَا<br>\
جَرَمَ and لَا عَنْ ذَا جَرَمَ (K) and لَا جَرَ, (Ks, K,<br>\
[in the CK لا جَرْمَ,]) in which the م is elided in<br>\
consequence of frequency of usage, as the ى is in<br>\
حَاشَ لِلّهِ for حَاشَى لِلّٰهِ, and the ى and ء in أَيْشَ<br>\
for أَىُّ شَىْءٍ, (Ks, TA,) and لَا ذَا جَرَ (IAar, TA)<br>\
and ↓ لَا جَرُمَ and ↓ لَا جُرْمَ, (K,) originally i. q.<br>\
لَا بُدَّ and لَامَحَالَةٌ [There is no avoiding it; it is<br>\
absolutely necessary; &amp;c.]: then, by reason of<br>\
frequency of usage, employed in the manner of<br>\
an oath, as meaning حَقًّا [verily, or truly];<br>\
wherefore, as in the case of an oath, ل is prefixed<br>\
to its complement, (Fr, S, Msb, K, *) so that they<br>\
say, لَا جَرَمَ لَآتِيَنّكَ [Verily I will come to thee],<br>\
(Fr, S, K,) and لَا جَرَمَ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ كَذَا [Verily I<br>\
will do thus], (S, Msb, *) and لَا جَرَمَ لَقَدْ كَانَ كَذَا<br>\
and لَا ذَا جَرَمَ and لَا ذَا جَرَ [Verily it was thus,<br>\
or verily such a thing happened]: (IAar, TA:)<br>\
ISd says, Kh asserts that جَرَمَ [or لَا جَرَمَ] is<br>\
only a reply to something said before it; as when<br>\
a man says, “They did such a thing,” and you<br>\
say, لَا جَرَمَ أَنَّهُمْ سَيَنْدَمُونَ, or أَنَّهُ سَيَكُونُ كَذَا<br>\
وَكَذَا; and Az says that لا in لَا جَرَمَ is said to be<br>\
a [mere] connective; and the meaning [of the<br>\
former of the last two phrases] is كَسَبَ لَهُمْ<br>\
عَمَلُهُمُ النَّدَمَ [It (their deed) will earn for them,<br>\
or occasion them, repentance; and that of the<br>\
latter, it will occasion that such and such things<br>\
shall happen]: and some say that جَرَمَ means<br>\
وَجَبَ, and حَقَّ, and that لا is a contradiction to<br>\
the words preceding it, and that a new proposition<br>\
then begins; as in the Kur [xvi. 64] where it is<br>\
said, لَا جَرَمَ أَنَّ لَهُمُ النَّارَ, i. e., [Nay, or] the case<br>\
is not as they have said: the fire [of Hell] is<br>\
their due. (TA.)<br>\
لَا جَرُمَ: see the paragraph next preceding.<br>\
جِرْمَةٌ People cutting off the fruit of palmtrees. (S, K, TA.) [In this sense it is app. a pl.<br>\
of pauc., or a quasi-pl. n., of جَارِمٌ, q. v.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
Ripening dates cut off from the trees: and this<br>\
sense, not the former as is implied in the S, is<br>\
meant by Imra-el-Keys, where he says,<br>\
عَلَوْنَ بِأَنْطَاكِيَّةٍ فَوْقَ عِقْمَةٍ<br>\
كَجِرْمَةٍ نَخْلٍ أَوْ كَجَنَّةِ يَثْرِبَ<br>\
[They mounted, at Antioch, upon a variegated<br>\
cloth, like the ripening dates cut off from palmtrees, or like the garden of Yethrib]: he likens<br>\
the variegated cloth and wool upon the هَوْدَج to<br>\
red and yellow ripening dates, or to the garden<br>\
of Yethrib because it abounded with palm-trees.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
جَرِمَةٌ: see جُرْمٌ.<br>\
جِرْمَانٌ: see جِرْمٌ.<br>\
جَرَامٌ (erroneously said in the K to be [جُرَامٌ]<br>\
like غُرَابٌ, TA) and ↓ جَرِيمٌ Dry dates: (AA, S,<br>\
M, K:) mentioned by ISk among [syn.] words<br>\
of the measures فَعَالٌ and فَعِيلٌ, like شَحَاحٌ and<br>\
شَحِيحٌ, and بَجَالٌ and بَجِيلٌ, &amp;c. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
both these words, (AA, S, K, *) but the former<br>\
not heard in this sense by ISd, (TA,) Datestones; (AA, S, K;) and so ↓ جُرْمٌ: (mentioned<br>\
in one copy of the S, but not in the TA, [probably an interpolation in the copy of the S above<br>\
mentioned:]) and ↓ جَرِيمَةٌ a date-stone; as in<br>\
the saying of &#39;Ows Ibn-Háritheh, لَا وَالَّذِى أَخْرَجَ<br>\
العَذْقَ مِنَ الجَرِيمَةِ وَالنَّارَ مِنَ الوَثِيمَةِ [No, by<br>\
Him who has produced the palm-tree with its<br>\
fruit from the date-stone, and fire from broken<br>\
stones]. (TA.)<br>\
جَرِيمٌ Dates (تَمْرٌ) cut off from the tree; (S,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ مَجْرُومٌ. (TA.) And شَجَرَةٌ جَرِيمَةٌ<br>\
A cut tree. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also جَرَامٌ, with which<br>\
it is syn. in two senses: in the latter sense having<br>\
جَرِيمَةٌ for its n un. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also A thing with which<br>\
date-stones are brayed, or crushed. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also مُجْرِمٌ.<br>\
-A3-  Also Large-bodied; (S, * K;) and<br>\
so ↓ مَجْرُومٌ: (K:) pl. (of the former, S) جِرَامٌ.<br>\
(S, K.) The fem. of the former is with ة: (K:)<br>\
[but] one says also جِلَّةٌ جَرِيمٌ, meaning Largebodied camels advanced in age. (S.)<br>\
-A4-  In El-<br>\
Hijáz, The [measure commonly termed] مُدّ is<br>\
thus called; accord. to Z, the مُدّ of the Prophet.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
جُرَامَةٌ i. q. جُذَامَةٌ; (K;) i. e., (TA,) The<br>\
dates that have fallen when they are cut off from<br>\
the tree: (S, TA:) so says As: (TA:) [but<br>\
see the latter word as explained on the authority<br>\
of the S in art. جذم:] and, (K,) or as some say,<br>\
(TA,) dates cut off from the tree: or what are<br>\
gotten (يُجْرَمُ) thereof, after their being cut off,<br>\
being picked up from the lower ends of the branches.<br>\
(K, TA. [See جَرِمَ.]) And The قَصَل of wheat and<br>\
barley; i. e., the extremities thereof, which are<br>\
bruised, and then cleared, or picked: (K, TA:)<br>\
but the term more known is جُذَامَةٌ, with ذال.<br>\

جَرِيمَةٌ The last of one&#39;s offspring: (K:) as<br>\
though there were a cutting off after it. (TA.)<br>\

-A4-  and جَرَامٌ.<br>\
جَارِمٌ Cutting off, or one who cuts off, the fruit<br>\
of the palm-tree: pl. جُرَّمٌ and جُرَّامٌ. (S.) [See<br>\
also جِرْمَةٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  جَارِمُ أَهْلِهِ (TA) and أَهْلِهِ ↓ جَرِيمَةُ<br>\
(S, K *) The gainer, acquirer, or earner, [of the<br>\
sustenance] of his family. (S, K, TA.)<br>\

also مُجْرِمٌ, in two places.<br>\
مُجْرِمٌ A sinner; a criminal; committing, or<br>\
a committer of, a sin, a crime, a fault, an offence,<br>\
or an act of disobedience; as also ↓ جَرِيمٌ (K)<br>\
and ↓ جَارِمٌ: (TA:) and المُجْرِمُونَ particularly<br>\
signifies the unbelievers: (Zj, K:) so in the Kur<br>\
vii. 38. (Zj, TA.) You say, عَلَى نَفْسِهِ ↓ هُوَ جَارِمٌ<br>\
وَقَوْمِهِ, [as also مُجْرِمٌ,] He is committing a crime,<br>\
or an offence for which he should be punished,<br>\
against himself and his people or party. (TA.)<br>\
مُجَرَّمٌ, (fem. with ة, S,) A complete year (S,<br>\
K) and month; (Ibn-Háni, TA;) a year past,<br>\
completed. (AZ, TA.)<br>\
