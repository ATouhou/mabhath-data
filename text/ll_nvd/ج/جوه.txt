جَاهَهُ بِالمَكْرُوهِ, (S,) or بِمَكْرُوهٍ, (K,) [aor.<br>\
يَجُوهُ,] inf. n. جَوْهٌ, (S,) i. q. جَبَهَهُ بِهِ [He met<br>\
him, or encountered him, with, or he said to him,<br>\
or did to him, or he accused him, to his face, of,<br>\
that which was, or a thing that was, disliked, or<br>\
hated]. (S, K.) And [in like manner,] جاههُ بِشَرٍّ<br>\
He encountered him with evil [speech or conduct];<br>\
or confronted him therewith: whence لَا جِهْتَ,<br>\
i. e. Mayest thou not be encountered with evil;<br>\
said in chiding a he-camel: see جَاهِ below. (TA.)<br>\
A woman of Ghatafán, being chidden by her son,<br>\
and being asked why she did not reply against<br>\
him, said, أَخَافُ أَنْ يَجُوهَنِى بِأَكْثَرَ مِنْ هٰذَا,<br>\
meaning I fear that he would encounter me with<br>\
more than this. (JK.)<br>\

جوّه and ↓ اجاه are rendered by Golius Ad<br>\
dignitatem evexit: spectabilem reddidit: as on<br>\
the authority of the S: but in my copies of the S<br>\
the two verbs are اوجه and وجّه; and belong to<br>\
art. وجه, though mentioned in the present art.]<br>\
4<br>\
أَجْوَهَ see 2.]<br>\
5<br>\
تجوّه He magnified himself; or was, or<br>\
became, proud, haughty, or disdainful: or he<br>\
affected rank, station, or dignity, not possessing<br>\
it. (TA.)<br>\
جَاهٌ Rank, station, or dignity, (S, K, TA, and<br>\
JK in art. وجه,) with, or in the estimation of, the<br>\
Sultán; (JK, TA;) as also ↓ جَاهَةٌ, (K,) on the<br>\
authority of Lh, (TA, as from the K, [but not in<br>\
my copies,]) or, accord. to Sgh, of Ks.: the<br>\
former word [probably arabicized from the Persian جَاهْ; but] said to be formed by transposition<br>\
from وَجْهٌ; this being first changed to جَوْهٌ; then,<br>\
to جَوَهٌ; and then, to جَاهٌ: or, accord. to Lh, it<br>\
is not from وَجْهٌ, but from جُهْت [app. جُهْتُ, first<br>\
pers. sing. of جَاهَ, q. v.]; though he does not<br>\
explain what is جُهْت. (TA.) You say, فُلَانٌ ذُو<br>\
جَاهٍ [Such a one is possessed of rank, station, or<br>\
dignity]. (S.) And لِفُلَانٍ جَاهٌ فِيهِمْ To such a<br>\
one belongs rank, station, or dignity, among them.<br>\
(Aboo-Bekr, TA.) The dim. of جَاهٌ [or of جَاهَةٌ]<br>\
is ↓ جُوَيْهَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  جَاهِ, indecl., with kesr for<br>\
its termination; and, accord. to As, sometimes,<br>\
جَاهٍ, with tenween; (S;) or جَاهِ جَاهِ, (JK, K,)<br>\
and جَاهٍ جَاهٍ, and جَاهْ جَاهْ, (Lh, K,) and جُوه<br>\
↓ جُوه, or جَوْه جَوْه, (accord. to different copies of<br>\
the K, but) indecl., with kesr for the termination,<br>\
[i. e. جُوهِ جُوهِ, or جَوْهِ جَوْهِ,] mentioned in the<br>\
M, (TA,) and ↓ جَاهِ لَا جِهْتَ, (IDrd, TA, [see 1,])<br>\
ejaculations used for chiding a he-camel, not a<br>\
she-camel: (As, JK, IDrd, S, K:) or one says<br>\
to a she-camel, عَاجٍ and جَاهٍ. (A &#39;Obeyd, TA in<br>\
art. عوج: [or perhaps there is an omission here:<br>\
I think it more likely that what A &#39;Obeyd said<br>\
was that one says to a she-camel عَاجٍ, and to a<br>\
he-camel جَاهٍ.])<br>\
جُوهٌ The face, or countenance: syn. وَجْهٌ; as<br>\
also جِيهٌ: (Lh, K:) the latter with kesr: (TA:)<br>\
so in the saying, نَظَرَ بِجُوهِ سَوْءٍ and بِجِيهِ سَوْءٍ [He<br>\
looked with an evil face or countenance]. (Lh,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A2-  جُوهِ جُوهِ, or جَوْهِ جَوْهِ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
