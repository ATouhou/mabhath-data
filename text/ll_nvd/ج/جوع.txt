or this is a simple subst., (Msb, TA,) and مَجَاعَةٌ,<br>\

in the belly; (TA;) contr. of شَبِعَ. (S, K, TA.)<br>\

(K,) or جَاعَ إِلَى لِقَائِهِ, (M, TA,) (tropical:)  He desired,<br>\
(M, K, *) and longed, (K,) [as though hungering,]<br>\

and ↓ جوّعهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَجْوِيعٌ; (Msb;)<br>\
He constrained him to be hungry, or empty in<br>\
the belly: (S, * K, TA:) or he debarred him<br>\
from food and drink. (Msb.) It is said in a<br>\
prov., أَجِعْ كَلْبَكَ يَتْبَعْكَ [Make thy dog to be<br>\
hungry and he will follow thee]; (S, K;) meaning (assumed tropical:)  constrain thou the ignoble to have recourse<br>\
to thee, by want, in order that he may continue<br>\
by thee; (K, * TA;) for if he be in no need of<br>\
thee, he will leave thee: and for أَجِعْ, some say<br>\
↓ جَوِّعْ. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تجوّع He made himself hungry, or empty<br>\
in the belly, intentionally, or purposely. (S, K.)<br>\
You say, تَوَحَّشْ لِلدَّوَآءِ and تَجَوَّعْ لِلدَّوَآءِ, [Make<br>\
thyself hungry, or make thy stomach empty of<br>\
food and beverage, (see art. وحش,) or] abstain<br>\

جُوعٌ, a subst., (Msb, TA,) signifying Hunger;<br>\
or emptiness of the belly; (TA;) contr. of شِبَعٌ;<br>\
(S, K, TA;) as also ↓ مَجَاعَةٌ, [properly an inf. n.,]<br>\
and ↓ مَجْوَعَةٌ, (K, TA,) and ↓ مَجُوعَةٌ. (TA.) You<br>\
say, جُوعًا لَهُ وَنُوعًا [May God decree hunger to<br>\
him]: accord. to Sb, an instance of inf. ns. in the<br>\
accus. case by reason of a verb understood: it is a<br>\
form of imprecation: and the latter noun may not<br>\
be put before the former, because it is a corroborative to it: (TA:) or, accord. to some, نُوعٌ means<br>\
“ thirst. ” (S, &amp;c., in art. نوع.) And ↓ عَامُ مَجَاعَةٍ<br>\
and ↓ مَجْوَعَةٍ (S, K) and ↓ مَجُوعَةٍ (TA) A year<br>\

year of hunger, &amp;c.]: (Msb:) pl. مَجَائِعُ (K)<br>\
and مَجَاوِهُ: as in the phrases أَصَابَتْهُمُ المَجَاوِعُ<br>\
[Cases of hunger, &amp;c., befell them] and وَقَعُوافِى<br>\
المَجَاوِعِ [They fell into cases of hunger, &amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.) And ↓ الرَّضَاعَةُ مِنَ المَجَاعَةِ, meaning The<br>\
sucking which occasions interdiction [of marriage<br>\
with the woman whose milk is sucked and certain<br>\
of her relations] is that consequent upon hunger<br>\
which is stopped by the milk in the time of<br>\
infancy of the child; not when the child&#39;s hunger<br>\
is only to be stopped by solid food. (Mgh.) [See<br>\
also 1 in art. رضع.] And it is said in a prov., سَمَنُ<br>\
كَلْبٍ بِجُوعِ أَهْلِهِ, i. e. [The dog&#39;s becoming fat<br>\
is] by reason of [the hunger of his owners occasioned by] murrain befalling the camels; (K, *<br>\
TA;) his owners falling into hunger and distress<br>\
and leanness: (TA:) or كلب was the name of<br>\
a certain man, who was an object of fear, wherefore he was asked for a pledge, and he pledged<br>\
his family: then obtaining possession of the camels,<br>\
or cattle, of the people to whom he had pledged<br>\
his family, he drove them away, and left his<br>\
family: (K, TA:) some relate this prov. differently, saying [سَمِنَ كَلْبٌ “ a dog,” or “ Kelb,”<br>\
“ became fat,” and] بِبُؤْسِ أَهْلِهِ [“ by reason of<br>\
the distress of his owners,” or “ his family ”].<br>\

جَوْعَانُ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
جَائِعٌ and ↓ جَوْعَانُ, (Msb, K, TA,) but not<br>\
جَيْعَانُ, [as the vulgar say,] for this a mistake,<br>\
(TA,) Hungry; or empty in the belly: (K, *<br>\
TA:) or debarred from food and drink: (Msb:)<br>\
the fem. [of the former] is جَائِعَةٌ and [of the<br>\
latter] جَوْعَى: (Msb, K:) and the pl. [of the<br>\
former] is جُوَّعٌ (S, Msb, K) and جُيَّعٌ, with the<br>\
و changed into ى, (L,) and [of the latter, or<br>\
perhaps of both,] جِيَاعٌ (S, K) and جَاعَةٌ (K * in<br>\
art. سوع) and جَيَاعَى [with the و changed into ى<br>\
contr. to rule, if this be not a mistake for جِيَاعٌ,<br>\
in which the و is changed into ى by rule].<br>\
(Msb.) You say جَائِعٌ نَائِعٌ; the latter word<br>\
being an imitative sequent; (TA;) or, accord.<br>\
to some, signifying “ thirsty. ” (S, &amp;c., in art.<br>\

عَلَى قَدْرِ مَا يَجُوعُ الشَّبْعَانُ [He, or it, is distant<br>\
from me as far as the space in which he who is<br>\
satiated with food becomes hungry]: (O, K: *)<br>\
and in like manner, عَلَى قَدْرِ مَعْطَشِ الرَّيَّانِ [as<br>\
far as the space in which he who is satisfied with<br>\
drink becomes thirsty]. (Z, TA.)<br>\
مَجَاعَةٌ: see جُوعٌ, in four places.<br>\

مُسْتَجِيعٌ A man (S) who always shows himself,<br>\
