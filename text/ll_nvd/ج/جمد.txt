(A:) or may he not cease to be in a stagnant, or<br>\
an unimproving, state or condition (لَا زَالَ جَامِدَ<br>\
الحَالِ). (S, L.) جَمَادِ is [a proper name,] indecl.,<br>\
with kesr for its termination, because it is transformed from the inf. n., namely, الجُمُودُ, like<br>\
فَجَارِ, which means الفَجْرَةُ: (S:) and the contr.<br>\
of جَمَادِ لَهُ is جَمَادِ لَهُ, (S, * A,) which denotes<br>\
praise. (S.) El-Mutalemmis says,<br>\
جَمَادِ لَهَا وَلَا تَقُولِى<br>\
لَهَا أَبَدًا إِذَا ذُكِرَتْ حَمَادِ<br>\

جَمُودٌ: see جَامِدٌ.<br>\
جُمُودٌ [app. Elevated tracts,] softer, or more<br>\
plain, than what is termed جُمُدٌ, and more intermixed with soft, or plain, tracts, sometimes in, or<br>\
by, that [kind of high ground] which is termed<br>\
قُفٌّ, and sometimes in, or by, soft, or plain,<br>\
tracts. (ISh, L, TA.)<br>\
جَمِيدُ العَيْنِ: see جَامِدٌ.<br>\
جُمَادَى One of the names of the months, (Msb,<br>\
K,) applied to two of the Arabian months, together called جُمَادَيَانِ, (TA,) and distinguished<br>\
by the appellations of جُمَادَى الأُولَى and جُمَادَى<br>\
الآخِرَةُ [the fifth and sixth months of the Arabian<br>\
year]: (S, K:) it is of the measure فُعَالَى, from<br>\
الجَمْدُ; (S;) the two months to which it is<br>\
applied being [said to be] so called because,<br>\
when the months were named, these two fell in<br>\
the season of the freezing of water: (ISd, L,<br>\
Msb:) [but this derivation seems to have been<br>\
invented when the two months thus named had<br>\
fallen back, into, or beyond, the winter; for<br>\
when they received this appellation, the former<br>\
of them evidently commenced in March, and the<br>\
latter ended in May; therefore I hold the opinion<br>\
of M. Caussin de Perceval, that they were thus<br>\
called because falling in a period when the earth<br>\
had become dry and hard by reason of paucity of<br>\
rain, from جَمَادٌ, an epithet applied to land upon<br>\
which rain has not fallen, or from جُمَادَى, an<br>\
epithet applied to an eye that sheds few tears;<br>\
which opinion is confirmed by the obvious derivations of the names of other months, صَفَرٌ and<br>\
رَبِيعٌ and رَمَضَانُ and شَوَّالٌ:] afterwards, when<br>\
the lunar months superseded the solar, the same<br>\
names were retained: (Msb:) [see زَمَنٌ, and<br>\
الهِجْرَةُ:] جمادى is determinate, (K,) being a<br>\
proper name, (TA,) and of the fem. gender:<br>\
(Msb, K:) if you find it masc., it is because it is<br>\
made to accord to الشَّهْرُ: all the other names of<br>\
the months are masc.: (Fr, IAmb, Msb:) the<br>\
pl. is جُمَادَيَاتٌ, (Fr, L, K,) agreeably with analogy; and if the form جِمَادٌ [a mistranscription<br>\
for جَمَائِدُ, like حَبَائِرُ, pl. of حُبَارَى,] were used,<br>\
it would also be agreeable with analogy. (Fr,<br>\
L.) The former of these two months is also<br>\
called جُمَادَى خَمْسَةٍ; and the latter, جُمَادَى سِتَّةٍ;<br>\
(K;) which mean, respectively, Jumádà the fifth<br>\
month and Jumádà the sixth month, from the<br>\
commencement of the year. (TA.) Lebeed says,<br>\
[describing a pair of wild asses,]<br>\
حَتَّى إِذَا سَلَخَا جُمَادَى سِتَّةً<br>\
جَزَآ فَطَالَ صِيَامُهُ وَصِيَامُهَا<br>\
[Until, when they both pass, and come to the end<br>\
of, Jumádà, completing six months, they satisfy<br>\
themselves with green pasture so as to be in no<br>\
need of water, and his and her abstinence from<br>\
water becomes of long continuance]: thus cited<br>\
by Bundár; ستّة being in the accus. case as a<br>\
denotative of state, and by جمادى being meant<br>\
جمادى الآخرة: or, accord. to IAar, the poet<br>\
said ستّةٍ, meaning the six months of winter,<br>\
which are the months of dew; and Aboo-&#39;Amr<br>\
Esh-Sheybánee says the like. (MF.) AHn says<br>\
that the Arabs applied the name of جمادى to<br>\
The whole of the winter; [see above;] whether<br>\
the winter were at the same time as the months<br>\
so called or not: and Aboo-Sa&#39;eed says the like.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also جَامِدٌ.<br>\
لَيْلَةٌ جُمَادِيَّةٌ A wintry night. (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed,<br>\
L.) [See جُمَادَى.]<br>\
جَمَّادٌ (tropical:)  A sword such that he who is struck with<br>\
it becomes motionless (يَجْمُدُ): (A, TA:) or a<br>\
sharp, cutting, sword. (AA, K.)<br>\
جَامِدٌ, applied to water, (Msb, K,) &amp;c., (Msb,)<br>\
[i. e.] anything fluid, or liquid, (K,) In a state<br>\
of congelation, concretion, or solidity; freezing;<br>\
as also ↓ جَمْدٌ; contr. of ذَائِبٌ: (Msb, K:) you<br>\
say مَآءٌ جَمْدٌ [as well as مَآءٌ جَامِدٌ]: (Msb:) or<br>\
↓ جَمْدٌ signifies what is congealed, or frozen, of<br>\
water [&amp;c.]; ice; (S, A;) contr. of ذَوْبٌ: (S:)<br>\
[see also جَمَدٌ:] it is originally an inf. n.: (S,<br>\
Msb, K:) [or it is an epithet from جَمُدَ, like<br>\
ضَخْمٌ from ضَخُمَ:] and ↓ جَمَدٌ is a pl. [or rather<br>\
a quasi-pl. n.] of جَامِدٌ, (S, Msb, K,) like as<br>\
خَدَمٌ is of خَادِمٌ: (S, Msb:) you say, قَدْ كَثُرَ<br>\
الجَمَدُ [The frozen waters have become many].<br>\
(S.) [Hence,] مُخَّةٌ جَامِدَةٌ A hard piece of<br>\
marrow. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  Remaining fixed, stationary,<br>\
or motionless. (Bd and Jel in xxvii. 90.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
thing that does not grow, or increase; [incapable<br>\
of growth, or increase; inanimate;] as stone, in<br>\
contradistinction to a tree [and an animal]. (Kull.)<br>\
[See also جَمَادٌ.] You say, لَكَ جَامِدُ هٰذَا المَالِ<br>\
وَذَائِبُهُ (A, L, K *) (tropical:)  To thee belongs, or shall belong,<br>\
what consists of gold and silver [or the like inanimate things], of this property, and what consists of live stock, thereof: (L, K:) or what<br>\
consists of stones, thereof, and what consists of<br>\
trees, thereof: or what is solid, thereof, and<br>\
what is fluid, or liquid, thereof. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence<br>\
its application in lexicology and grammar to (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
noun that is not an inf. n. nor derived from an<br>\
inf. n.; a noun having the quality of a real substantive (اِسْمِ عَيْنٍ), opposed to that which has<br>\
the quality of an ideal substantive (اِسْمُ مَعْنًى):<br>\
and (assumed tropical:)  a verb that has but one tense and no inf. n.,<br>\
as لَيْسَ and نِعْمَ &amp;c., opposed (as is said in the<br>\
TA voce قَدْ) to مُتَصَرِّفٌ: it may be rendered (and<br>\
so I have rendered it), in these cases, aplastic.]<br>\

-b6-  (assumed tropical:)  Stupid,<br>\

is also applied to a man&#39;s state, or condition: you<br>\
say رَجُلٌ جَامِدُ الحَالِ (assumed tropical:)  [A man in a stagnant, or<br>\
unimproving, state or condition]. (S, L.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And<br>\
to the eye: you say عَيْنٌ جَامِدَةٌ (assumed tropical:)  An eye that<br>\
sheds no tears; (Ks, K;) as also ↓ جُمَادَى, (Ks,<br>\
K,) and ↓ جَمُودٌ; (S, K;) or this last signifies<br>\
(tropical:)  an eye that sheds few tears. (A.) And رَجُلٌ<br>\
جَامِدُ العَيْنِ, (A, K,) and العين ↓ جَمِيدُ, and<br>\
العين ↓ جَمَادُ, (A,) (tropical:)  A man whose eye sheds few<br>\
tears; (A;) or whose eye sheds no tears. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b9-  See also جَمَادٌ. ―<br>\

places. ―<br>\
-b2-  The person who is entrusted with the<br>\
management of affairs in a game of chance (قِمَار<br>\
[here meaning the game called المَيْسِر]): (K:)<br>\
[i. q. ضَرِيبٌ:] or the person entrusted with the<br>\
management of affairs among a people or party,<br>\
(T, K, TA,) who does not take part in the game<br>\
called المَيْسِر, except that he shuffles the arrows<br>\
(يَضْرِبُ بِهَا) for the players, and has them placed<br>\
in his hands, and is confided in with respect to<br>\
them, and compels him who has incurred an<br>\
obligation to fulfil it: (L, TA:) or one who<br>\
takes no part in the game called المَيْسِر, (who is<br>\
called بَرَمٌ,) but who sometimes shuffles, or deals<br>\
forth, the arrows, (يُفِيضُ بِهَا,) for the players;<br>\
so in the following verse of Tarafeh:<br>\
وَأَصْفَرَ مَضْبُوحٍ نَظَرْتُ حَوِيرَهُ<br>\
عَلَى النَّارِ وَاسْتَوْدَعْتُهُ كَفَّ مُجْمِدِ<br>\

by fire, I have awaited the sound over the fire,<br>\
and I have deposited it in the hand of one taking<br>\
no part in the game but only shuffling, or dealing<br>\
forth, the arrows for the players]; meaning, I<br>\
have awaited its sound, which was like an answer<br>\
proceeding from it, when I straightened it and<br>\
marked it, over the fire: (S:) [or, accord. to the<br>\
EM (p. 105), where we find حِوَارَهُ in the place<br>\
of حَوِيرَهُ, the meaning is, and of many a yellow<br>\
arrow, &amp;c., I have awaited the returning and<br>\
gaining, while we were assembled at the fire,<br>\
&amp;c.:] or مجمد here means a man taking with<br>\
both his hands so as not to let anything go forth<br>\
from them: (AA, TA:) or, accord. to As, it<br>\
here means a man entering upon Jumádà, which<br>\
was in that [the poet&#39;s] time a month of cold:<br>\
(S, K: *) or one whose arrow does not gain anything in the game called المَيْسِر: (L:) or a person<br>\
in whom one confides, and who is tenacious of<br>\
that which is in his hand or possession, and not<br>\
to be deceived. (A &#39;Obeyd, TA.)<br>\
