جَزْفٌ [inf. n. of جَزَفَ] signifies The taking a<br>\
thing [in the manner termed] مَجَازَفَةً and جِزَافًا<br>\
[i. e. by conjecture, not knowing the measure nor<br>\
the weight]: (S, TA:) or the taking largely, or<br>\
copiously: (IF, Msb, TA:) and it is [from] a<br>\
Persian word. (Msb. [See جُزَافٌ, below.]) And<br>\
you say, جَزَفَ فِى الكَيْلِ, inf. n. جَزْفٌ, He gave<br>\
large measure: (IKtt, Msb:) and جَزَفَ لَهُ فِى<br>\
الكَيْلِ He gave him large measure. (Jm, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
جازف, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. مُجَازَفَةٌ (S, Msb,<br>\
K, TA) and جِزَافٌ, (S, TA,) He sold, or bought,<br>\
a thing not knowing its measure nor its weight:<br>\
(Msb:) or he conjectured in selling and buying.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He acted in an easy, or a facile, manner,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) in selling or buying. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And hence, جازف بِنَفْسِهِ (tropical:)  He perilled, endangered,<br>\
jeoparded, hazarded, or risked, himself; as though<br>\
he acted in an easy manner with himself. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تجزّف فِيهِ He picked out, or selected, the<br>\
good in it; syn. تَنَقَّدَ [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
تَنَفَّذَ]. (Sgh, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
اجترف He bought a thing by conjecture, not<br>\
knowing the measure nor the weight. (AA, K.)<br>\
جَزْفٌ Of unknown quantity, whether measured<br>\
or weighed. (Nh, TA.)<br>\

جَزَافٌ: see what next follows, in two places.<br>\
جُزَافٌ, accord. to the &#39;Eyn, in selling and buying,<br>\
is [The selling, and buying,] by conjecture, without measuring and without weighing; and by<br>\
rule should be ↓ جِزَافٌ, with kesr; i. e., if formed<br>\
in accordance to the verb [which is جَازَفَ]: (Mgh:)<br>\
or the selling or buying a thing not knowing its<br>\
measure nor its weight: (Msb:) or conjecture<br>\
in selling and buying; as also ↓ جِزَافٌ and ↓ جَزَافٌ<br>\
and ↓ جُزَافَةٌ and ↓ جِزَافَةٌ and ↓ جَزَافَةٌ: (K, TA:)<br>\
arabicized, from گُزَافْ, (Msb, K, TA,) which is<br>\
Persian: (Msb, TA:) they say لَافْ وگَزَافْ, meaning “ excess in speech, by conjecture: ” accord. to<br>\
the Jm, its primary signification is muchness, or<br>\
copiousness: (TA:) some say that the most chaste<br>\
form of جزاف is ↓ جِزَافٌ, with kesr; [because<br>\
this is a regular inf. n. of جَازَفَ;] (MF, TA;)<br>\
and some, that the triple vocalization of the ج in<br>\
جزاف is a kind of جزاف [i. e. conjecture], since<br>\
all assert it to be a Persian word arabicized, and<br>\
it cannot be so and be also an inf. n., conformable<br>\
to the verb and to rule: it seems that, when<br>\
they arabicized it, its original was gradually forgotten, so they formed from it a verb, and derived<br>\
from it, and made it analogous. (TA.) ―<br>\
