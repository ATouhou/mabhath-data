She gave birth to a جحجاج. (TA.) And<br>\
جحجحت بِوَلَدِهَا She brought forth her child a<br>\
جحجاح. (A.)<br>\

-b2-  Also<br>\
A low, an ignoble, a vile, a mean, or a sordid,<br>\
man; possessing no manly qualities. (AA, T,<br>\
K.) [Thus it bears two contr. significations.]<br>\
جَحْجَاحٌ (S, A, K) and ↓ جَحْجَحٌ (K) A chief,<br>\
lord, master, or man of rank or quality or distinction: (S, A, K:) or one who is liberal, bountiful, or munificent; or one who is noble, or<br>\
generous: (TA:) and one who hastens [to render<br>\
aid] in cases of evil: (A:) pl. (of the former,<br>\
S, A, TA, [or of the latter accord. to analogy,])<br>\
جَحَاجِحُ (S, A, K) and (of the same, A, TA)<br>\
جَحَاجِحَةٌ (A, K) and جَحَاجِيحُ: (K:) it is said<br>\
in the S that these two are pls. of the first pl.;<br>\
the ة in the former of them being substituted for<br>\
the ى in the latter of them, which is rejected;<br>\
for one of these two letters must be retained, but<br>\
both cannot be together: this assertion in the S,<br>\
however, is well refuted by MF. (TA.)<br>\
