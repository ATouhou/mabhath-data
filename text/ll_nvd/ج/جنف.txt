جَنَفٌ (T, S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and جُنُوفٌ,<br>\
(K,) the former being inf. n. of جَنِفَ and the<br>\
latter of جَنَفَ, (TA,) The act of inclining, or<br>\
declining (T, S, Mgh, K, TA) in speech and in<br>\
all affairs: (TA:) and declining, or deviating,<br>\
from the right course; acting wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically; (T, Msb, *<br>\
K, TA;) like حَيْفٌ, which some erroneously<br>\
assert to be the act of a judge only. (T, TA.)<br>\
You say, جَنِفَ, (T, S, Mgh, Msb,) aor.<br>\
جَنَفَ, inf. n.<br>\
جَنَفٌ; (S, Msb;) [and app. جَنَفَ, aor.<br>\
جَنِفَ, inf. n.<br>\
جُنُوفٌ;] and ↓ اجنف; (T, Msb, TA;) He inclined or declined [in speech and in any affair]:<br>\
(T, S, TA:) and he declined, or deviated, from<br>\
the right course; acted wrongfully, unjustly,<br>\
injuriously, or tyrannically; (T, Mgh, Msb, TA;)<br>\
عَلَيْهِ against him. (Mgh.) Hence, in the Kur<br>\
[ii. 178], فَمَنْ خَافَ مِنْ مُوصٍ جَنَفًا (S, TA,) i. e.<br>\
[And he who feareth, (or, as is said in the K in<br>\
art. خوف, knoweth,) from, or on the part of,<br>\
the testator,] an inclining [to a wrong course],<br>\
or a declining [from the right course]: (TA:)<br>\
or a manifest inclining or declining. (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA.) You say, جَنِفَ فِى وَصِيَّتِهِ, aor.<br>\
جَنَفَ; [He<br>\
inclined, &amp;c., in his testament;] and so ↓ اجنف.<br>\
(K.) And ↓ اجنف signifies He deviated from<br>\
that which was right. (K.) And فِى حُكْمِهِ ↓ اجنف<br>\
[He declined from the right course, or acted<br>\
wrongfully or unjustly, in his judgment]. (TA.)<br>\
Or ↓ اجنف relates peculiarly to the case of a<br>\
testament: and جَنِفَ signifies absolutely He<br>\
declined, or deviated, from that which was right.<br>\
(K.) And you say, جَنِفَ عَنْ طَرِيقِهِ, aor.<br>\
جَنَفَ;<br>\
and جَنَفَ, aor.<br>\
جَنِفَ; inf. n. جَنَفٌ, (K, TA,) which<br>\
is of the former verb, (TA,) and جُنُوفٌ, (K, TA,)<br>\
which is of the latter verb; He turned away<br>\
from his course, or way; deviated therefrom.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Or [app. a mistake for “and ”] جَنَفٌ<br>\
signifies Depression (دُخُولٌ and اِنْهِضَامٌ) in one<br>\
of the two sides of the breast, or chest, (الزَّوْرِ,)<br>\
with evenness of the other side: (K:) the verb<br>\
is جَنِفَ: and the part. n. is ↓ جَنِفٌ and ↓ أَجْنَفُ,<br>\
fem. [of the latter] جَنْفَآءُ. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
جنَافٌ [an inf. n. of which the verb (جانف)<br>\
is not mentioned]. You say, لَجَّ فِى جِنَافٍ قَبِيحٍ<br>\
He persisted in removing himself to a distance,<br>\
or estranging himself, from his family; (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, K;) like جِنَابٍ قَبِيحٍ. (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اجنف He committed an act of inclining [to a<br>\
wrong course], or declining [from the right course,<br>\
or acting wrongfully or unjustly or injuriously or<br>\
tyrannically]; like as you say, أَلَامَ, meaning<br>\
“he did a thing for which he should be blamed.”<br>\
(S.) See also 1, in five places.<br>\
-A2-  اجنفهُ He<br>\
found him to be one who deviated from the right<br>\
way in his judgment; who acted wrongfully, unjustly, injuriously, or tyrannically, therein. (K.)<br>\
تجانف فِى مِشْيَتِهِ ?? He carried himself in a<br>\
proud and self-conceited manner, [affecting an<br>\
inclining of the body from side to side,] in his<br>\
gait. (TA.) [And He inclined on one side in<br>\
his gait: said of one who is lame of one leg:<br>\
see مَحْرُوقٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  تجانف عَنْ طَرِيقِهِ He affected<br>\
a declining, or deviating, from his course, or<br>\

like manner, تجانف إِلَى الشَّىْءِ [He affected an<br>\
inclining to the thing; intentionally inclined to<br>\
it]. (TA.) You say, تجانف لِإِثْمٍ He inclined<br>\
to a sin, (S, Mgh,) [or affected an inclining to<br>\
it, (see the part. n., below,)] intending, or purposing, the commission of an act of disobedience.<br>\
(Mgh.)<br>\
جَنَفَ is [an epithet] like دَنَفَ, applying to a<br>\
sing. and a pl., [being] also an inf. n. [of جَنِفَ,<br>\
q. v.]: Abu-l-&#39;Iyál El-Hudhalee says,<br>\
أَلَّا دَرَأْتَ الخَصْمَ حِينَ رَأَيْتُهُمْ<br>\
جَنَفًا عَلَىَّ بِأَلْسُنٍ وَعُيُونِ<br>\
[Wherefore didst not thou repel the adversaries,<br>\
when thou sawest them inclining, or acting wrongfully, against me with tongues and eyes?]: or,<br>\
accord. to one reading, جُنُفًا [which is a pl. of<br>\
↓ جَانِفٌ]: (Skr p. 128:) [or, as some say,] جَنَفًا<br>\
is a pl. [or rather quasi-pl. n.] of ↓ جَانِفٌ, like<br>\
as رَوَحَ is of رَائِحٌ: or it may be for ذَوِي جَنَفٍ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
