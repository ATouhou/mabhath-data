جَدَّهُ, aor.<br>\
جَدُ3َ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. جَدٌّ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) He cut it, or cut it off. (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K.) This is the primary signification. (Mgh.)<br>\
You say of a weaver, جَدَّ ثَوْبًا He cut off a piece<br>\
of cloth [sufficient for a garment or the like, from<br>\
the web]. (S, K.) And جَدَّ النَّخْلَ, (S, Mgh, L,)<br>\
aor,<br>\
جَدُ3َ, (S, L,) inf. n. جَدٌّ (S, L, K) and جَدَادٌ<br>\
(Lh, Mgh, L) and جِدَادٌ; (Lh, L; [in the L, the<br>\
last two forms are mentioned as inf. ns., and the<br>\
former of them is mentioned as inf. n. in the<br>\
Mgh; but in the K, they are only mentioned as<br>\
syn. with جَدٌّ; and in the S, it seems to be<br>\
implied that they are simple substs., or quasiinf. ns.;]) i. q. صَرَمَهُ; (Lh, S, Mgh, K; *) [like<br>\
جَذَّهُ and جَزَّهُ;] i.e., He cut off the fruit of the<br>\
palm-trees. (Mgh, L. [See also جَدَادٌ.]) And<br>\
جُدَّتْ أَخْلَافُ النَّاقَةِ The she-camel&#39;s teats were cut<br>\
off by some accident that befell her: (As, TA:)<br>\
or, in consequence of injury occasioned to her by<br>\
the صِرَار [q. v.]. (S.) And تَجْدِيدٌ [inf. n. of<br>\
↓ جدّد] signifies The cutting off the teat of a<br>\
camel. (KL.) You say also, جُدَّ ثَدْيَا أُمِّكَ May<br>\
thy mother&#39;s breasts be cut off: a form of imprecation against a man; and implying a wish for<br>\
his separation. (As, L, from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5.<br>\
-A2-  جَدَّ, aor.<br>\
جَدِ3َ, inf. n. جِدَّةٌ, It (a garment, TA,<br>\
or a thing, S, Msb, TA) was new; (S, L, Msb,<br>\
K;) [as though newly cut off from the web;]<br>\
from جَدَّ as signifying “ he cut,” or “ cut off. ”<br>\
(L.) [See also 5.]<br>\
-A3-  جَدَّ, like تَعِبَ, (Msb,)<br>\
see. pers. جَدِدٌتَ, [like its syn. حَظِظْتَ,] (L,<br>\
Msb,) aor. يَجَدُّ; (Msb;) or جُدَّ, with damm,<br>\
(Mgh,) see. pers. جُدِدْتَ, (S,) [aor. يُجَدُّ;] inf. n.<br>\

fortunate, or possessed of good fortune, (S, Mgh,<br>\
L, Msb,) or of good worldly fortune; (TA;) he<br>\
advanced in the world, or in worldly circumstances; (Mgh;) بِالأَمْرِ by the affair, or event,<br>\
whether good or evil; (L;) or بِالشَّىْءِ by the<br>\
thing. (Msb.) And هُمْ يُجَدُّونَ بِهِمْ, as also<br>\
يُحَظُّونَ بهم, They become possessed of good fortune, and riches, or competence, or sufficiency.<br>\
(Ibn-Buzurj, L.) [You say also, جَدَّ جَدُّهُ (tropical:) : so in<br>\
a copy of the A: probably a mistranscription for<br>\
جَدَّ جِدُّهُ, which see below: if not, meaning His<br>\
fortune became good; or his good fortune increased in goodness: or, perhaps, his dignity<br>\
became great; from what next follows].<br>\
-A4-  جَدّ<br>\
فِى عَيْنِى, (S, A,) or فِى عُيُونِ النَّاسِ, and صُدُورِهِمْ,<br>\
(Mgh,) aor.<br>\
جَدِ3َ, inf. n. جَدٌّ, (S,) He was, or became, great, or of great dignity or estimation, in<br>\
my eye, or in the eyes of men, and their minds.<br>\
(S, A, Mgh.) It is said in a trad. of Anas, كَانَ<br>\
الرَّجُلُ مِنَّا إِذَا قَرَأَ البَقَرَةَ وَآلَ عِمْرَانَ جَدَّ فِينَا, i. e.,<br>\
[A man of us, when he recited the chapter of<br>\
the Cow and that of the Family of &#39;Imrán (the<br>\
second and third chapters of the Kur-án),] used<br>\
to be great in our eyes. (S.)<br>\
-A5-  جَدَّ فِى الأَمْرِ, (S,<br>\
A, K,) or فِى أَمْرِهِ, (L,) or فِى كَلَامِهِ, (Msb,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
جَدِ3َ (S, L, Msb, K) and<br>\
جَدُ3َ, (L, K,) inf. n. جِدٌّ,<br>\
(S, K,) or جَدٌّ, (L, Msb,) جِدٌّ being a simple<br>\
subst.; (Msb;) and فِيهِ ↓ اجدّ; (L, K;) He was<br>\
serious, or in earnest, (S, A, L, Msb, K,) in the<br>\
affair, (S, A, K,) or in his affair, (L,) or in his<br>\
speech; (Msb;) syn. حَقَّقَ; (L;) contr. of هَزَلَ.<br>\
(L, Msb. [In the S and A and K, the inf. n. is<br>\
said to signify the contr. of هَزْلٌ; and in the K,<br>\
it is also said to be syn. with تَحْقِيقٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And جَدَّ<br>\
فِى الأَمْرِ, (As, S, L, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
جَدِ3َ and<br>\
جَدُ3َ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) inf. n. جِدٌّ, (S, * K, * TA,) or this is a simple<br>\
subst., and the inf. n. is جَدٌّ; (Msb;) and فيه ↓ اجدّ;<br>\
(As, S, L, K;) signify also He strove, laboured,<br>\
or toiled; exerted himself or his power or efforts or<br>\
endeavours or ability; employed himself vigorously,<br>\
strenuously, laboriously, diligently, studiously, sedulously, earnestly, or with energy; was diligent,<br>\
or studious; took pains, or extraordinary pains;<br>\
in the affair. (As, S, L, Msb, K.) And جَدَّفِى<br>\
السَّيْرِ He strove, laboured, toiled, or exerted himself, in going, or journeying, or in his course,<br>\
or pace; (tropical:)  he hastened therein: and in like<br>\
manner, السَّيْرَ ↓ اجدّ (assumed tropical:) he hastened his course, or<br>\
pace. (L.) And جَدَّ جِدُّهُ, [meaning His labour,<br>\
or exertion, or energy, was, or became, great,<br>\
or extraordinary: or] meaning اِزْدَادَ جِدُّهُ جِدًّا<br>\
[his labour, &amp;c., increased in labour, &amp;c.]: or it<br>\
may mean what was not [his] جِدّ, became جِدّ;<br>\
wherefore, i. e. because it would be so eventually,<br>\
it is here so called. (Ham p. 33. [See also<br>\
جَدَّ جَدُّهُ, above.] ―<br>\
-b3-  جَدَّ بِهِ الأَمْرُ (A, L) (tropical:) The<br>\
affair, or event, distressed, or afflicted, him.<br>\
(L.) So in the saying of Aboo-Sahm,<br>\
أَخَالِدُ لَا يَرْضَى عَنِ العَبْدِ رَبُّهُ<br>\
إِذَا جَدَّ بِالشَّيْخِ العُقُوقُ المُصَمِّمُ<br>\
[O Khálid, his Lord will not approve of the<br>\
servant, or man, (meaning the son,) when cutting,<br>\
or biting, disobedience to a parent distresses the<br>\
old man]. (L.)<br>\
-A6-  جَدَّ, aor,<br>\
جَدِ3َ inf. n. جَدٌّ and<br>\
جِدٌّ, It (a house, or tent, بَيْت) dripped, or let<br>\
fall drops. (K.)<br>\
2<br>\
جدّد, inf. n. تَجْدِيدٌ: see 1.<br>\
-A2-  See also 4,<br>\
in three places.<br>\
-A3-  تجديد also signifies The<br>\
making [or weaving] stripes of different colours<br>\
in a garment. (KL.)<br>\
3<br>\
جادّهُ فِى الأَمْرِ, (S, L, K, *) inf. n. مُجَادَّةٌ,<br>\
(L,) i. q. حَاقَّهٌ (S, L) or حَاقَقَهُ (K) [He contended with him respecting a thing, each of them<br>\
asserting his right therein: so accord. to explanations of حاقّهُ in the lexicons: but I think<br>\
that the meaning intended here is, he acted<br>\
seriously, or in earnest, with him in the affair;<br>\
and this is confirmed by its being immediately<br>\
added in the TA, after حاققه, “and أَجَدَّ ” signifies “ حَقَّقَ, as above mentioned: ” see جَدَّفِى<br>\
الأَمْرِ expl. by حَقَّقَ as contr. of هَزَلَ]. Also He<br>\
exerted his full effort, or endeavour, or energy,<br>\
with him in the affair. (So accord. to an explanation of the inf. n., مجادَة, in the KL.)<br>\
4<br>\
اجدّ النَّخْلُ The palm-trees attained to the<br>\
time for the cutting off of the fruit. (S, A, * L,<br>\
Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, perhaps,] أَجَدَّتْ قَرُنِى مِنْهُ<br>\
I (myself, TA) relinquished, or forsook, him, or<br>\
it. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  اجدّهُ, and ↓ استجدّهُ, (S, A, L, K,)<br>\
and ↓ جدّدهُ, (S, L, K,) He made it new; (S, A,<br>\
L, K;) namely, a thing, (S,) or a garment: (A,<br>\
TA:) or he put it on, or wore it, new; namely,<br>\
a garment. (TA.) One says to him who puts<br>\
on a new garment, أَبْلِ وَأَجِدَّ وَاحْمَدِ الكَاسِى [Wear<br>\
out, and make, or put on, new, and praise the<br>\
Clother, meaning God]. (S.) And you say,<br>\
بَهِىَ بَيْتُ فُلَانٍ فَأَجَدَّ بَيْتًا مِنْ شَعَرٍ [The tent of<br>\
such a one was, or became, rent, or pierced with<br>\
holes; therefore he made a new tent of haircloth]. (S.) And الأَمْرَ ↓ جدّد, and اجدّهُ, and<br>\
↓ استجدّهُ, He originated, or innovated, the thing,<br>\
or affair; or did it newly, or for the first time<br>\
(Msb.) And الوُضُوْءَ ↓ جدّد (tropical:)  [He renewed the<br>\
ablution termed وضوء], and العَهْدَ (tropical:)  [the compact,<br>\
or contract, or covenant, &amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اجدّ<br>\
فُلَانٌ أَمْرَهُ بِذٰلِكَ Such a one established, or settled,<br>\
firmly his affair, or case, thereby, or therein:<br>\
so says As, and he cites the following verse:<br>\
أَجَدَّ بِهَا أَمْرًا وَأَيْقَنَ أَنَّهُ<br>\
لَهَا أَوْخْرَي كَالطَّحِينَ تُرَابُهَا<br>\
[He established, or settled, firmly his case thereby,<br>\
or therein, and knew certainly that he was for<br>\
it, (app. meaning a war, or battle, حَرْب, which<br>\
is fem.,) or for another whereof the dust would<br>\
be like flour]: Aboo-Nasr says, It has been related to me that he said, اجدَ بها امرًا means اجدّ<br>\
أَمْرَهُ بِهَا; [and so this phrase is explained in the<br>\
K;] but the former explanation I heard from<br>\
himself: (L:) or this phrase means أَجَدَّ أَمْرُهُ بِهَا<br>\
[so in two copies of the S, app., (assumed tropical:)  his affair, or<br>\
case, became easy, or practicable, thereby, like<br>\
ground termed جَدَد, which is easy to walk, or<br>\
travel, upon; see the next sentence]; امر being<br>\
put in the accus. case as a specificative, like عَيْنًا<br>\
in the phrase قَرِرْتُ بِهِ عَيْنًا, meaning قَرَّتْ بِهِ عَيْنِى.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
-A3-  اجدّ also signifies It (a road) was, or<br>\
became, what is termed جَدَد [i. e. hard, or level,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (S, K.) And اجدّت لَكَ الأَرْضُ The ground<br>\
hath become to thee free from soft places, and<br>\
clear to thy view. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He walked<br>\
along, or traversed, what is termed جَدَد. (K.)<br>\
And اجدّ القَوْمُ The people, or company of men,<br>\
came to what is so termed: (S:) and ascended<br>\
upon the surface (جَدِيد) of the ground: or went<br>\
upon sand such as is termed جَدَد. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  See<br>\
also 1, in three places.<br>\
5<br>\
تجدّد [originally It became cut, or cut off.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] It (an udder) lost, or became<br>\
devoid of, its milk: (S, K:) and [in like manner]<br>\
↓ جُدَّ, aor. يُجَدُّ, inf. n. جَدَدٌ, it, (a breast, and<br>\
an udder,) became dry. (A Heyth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence<br>\
also, [It was newly made; as though newly cut<br>\
off from the web;] said of a garment: (TA:)<br>\
and it (a thing, S, A) became new: (S, A, K:)<br>\
and it (a thing, or an affair,) originated; was<br>\
originated, or innovated; or was done newly, or<br>\
for the first time: and sometimes ↓ استجدّ is used<br>\
intransitively [in the same senses]. (Msb.) [Also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  It (an action, as, for instance, ablution, and a<br>\
compact, or the like,) was renewed. See جَدَّدَ as<br>\
syn. with أَجَدَّ.]<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَجْدَ3َ see 4, in two places:<br>\
-A2-  and see also 5.<br>\
جَدٌّ Fortune, or particularly good fortune,<br>\
syn. حَظٌّ, (S, A, Mgh, L, K,) and بَخْتٌ, (S, A,<br>\
L, K,) in the world, or in wordly circumstances;<br>\
(TA;) advance in the world, or in worldly circumstances: (Mgh:) pl. [of mult.] جُدُودٌ (S)<br>\
and [of pauc.] أَجْدَادٌ and أَجُدٌّ. (TA.) You<br>\
say, فُلَانٌ ذُو جَدٍّ فِى كَذَا Such a one is possessed<br>\
of good fortune in such a thing. (L.) And it<br>\
is said in a trad. respecting the day of resurrection, وَإِذَا أَصْحَابُ الجَدِّ مَحْبُوسُونَ And lo, the<br>\
people who were possessed of good fortune and<br>\
riches in the world were imprisoned. (L.) And<br>\
in a prayer, (L,) لَا يَنْفَعُ ذَا الجَدِّ مِنْكَ الجَدُّ The<br>\
good worldly fortune of him who is possessed of<br>\
such fortune will not profit him, (Mgh, L,) in<br>\
the world to come, (L,) in lieu of Thee; (Mgh,<br>\
L; *) i. e., of obedience to Thee: (Mgh, and<br>\
Mughnee in art. مِنْ:) or in lieu of the good<br>\
fortune that cometh from Thee: or, as some say,<br>\
will not defend him from Thee. (Mughnee ubi<br>\
suprà. [See also another explanation below.])<br>\
Hence, أَجَدَّكَ لَا تَفْعَلْ [or أَجَدِّكَ]; and, accord. to<br>\
some, وَجَدِّكَ: see جِدٌّ. ―<br>\
-b2-  One&#39;s lot in life; and<br>\
the means of subsistence that one receives from the<br>\
bounty of God. (L, K.) One says, لِفُلَانٍ فِى<br>\
هٰذَا الأَمْرِ جَدٌّ Such a one has in this thing, or<br>\
state of affairs, means of subsistence. (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Richness; competence, or sufficiency; or<br>\
the state of being in no need, or of having no wants,<br>\
or of having few wants. (S, L, Msb.) لا ينفع ذا<br>\
الجدّ منك الجدّ, [explained above, is said to<br>\
mean] Riches, &amp;c., will not profit the possessor<br>\
thereof with Thee; for nothing will profit him<br>\
but acting in obedience to Thee: منك here signifies عِنْدَكَ. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Greatness, or majesty;<br>\
(Mujáhid, S, Mgh, Msb, K;) accord. to some,<br>\
specially of God: (TA:) so in the Kur lxxii. 3:<br>\
(S, TA:) or his freedom from all wants or the<br>\
like; syn. غِنًى. (S.) Hence, تَعَالَى جَدُّكَ, (Mgh,<br>\
TA,) in a trad. respecting prayer, (TA,) Exalted<br>\
be thy greatness, or majesty. (Mgh, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
See also أَجَدَّكَ, as an interrogative phrase, voce<br>\
جِدٌّ.<br>\
-A2-  Also, (S, K,) and ↓ مَجْدُودٌ, (S, A, Mgh,<br>\
K,) and ↓ جَدِيدٌ, (S, Msb, K,) and ↓ جَدِّيٌّ, (S,)<br>\
and ↓ جُدٌّ, and ↓ جُدِّيٌّ, the last two with damm,<br>\
(K,) applied to a man, Fortunate; or possessed<br>\
of good fortune; (S, A, Mgh, Msb;) or possessed<br>\
of good worldly fortune: (TA:) or possessing<br>\
great fortune, or great good fortune: (K:) [the<br>\
words here given from the S are there coupled<br>\
with synonyms of the same form, thus; ↓ جَدِيدٌ<br>\
حَظِيظٌ, and مَحْظُوظٌ ↓ مَجْدُودق, and جَدٌّ حَظُّ,<br>\
and حَظِّىٌّ ↓ جَدِّيٌّ; on the authority of ISk:]<br>\
↓ جُدٌّ, with damm, as an epithet applied to a<br>\
man, is said by Sb to be syn. with مَجْدُودٌ; and<br>\
its pl. is جُدٌّونَ only. (L.)<br>\
-A3-  Also جَدُّ, A<br>\
grandfather; the father&#39;s father, and the mother&#39;s<br>\
father: (S, Msb, K:) and (assumed tropical:)  a higher ascendant;<br>\
an ancestor: (Msb:) and ↓ جَدَّةٌ a grandmother;<br>\
the father&#39;s mother, and the mother&#39;s mother:<br>\
(K:) [and (assumed tropical:)  a female ancestor:] pl. of the<br>\
former, أَجْدَادٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and جُدُودٌ and<br>\
جُدُودَةٌ: (K:) and of the latter, جَدَّاتٌ. (TA.)<br>\
Hence, accord. to some, وَجَدِّكَ لَا تَفْعَلْ: see جِدٌّ.<br>\
-A4-  See also جُدَّةٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see جَدِيدٌ.<br>\
جُدٌّ: see جَدٌّ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  See also جُدَّةٌ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also The side (جَانِب) of anything. (K.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
And A well in a place where is much herbage,<br>\
or pasture: (S, Msb, K:) a well abounding with<br>\
water; (K;) [and] so ↓ جُدْجُدٌ; (KL;) but<br>\
A&#39;Obeyd says that this is not known: (L:) and,<br>\
contr., a well containing little water: a scanty<br>\
water, or water little in quantity: a water at<br>\
the extremity of a [desert such as is called] فَلَاة:<br>\
(K:) an old water: (Th, K:) an old well:<br>\
(KL:) pl. (in all these senses, TA) أَجْدَادٌ.<br>\
(Msb, TA.)<br>\
جِدٌّ [accord. to some an inf. n., but accord. to<br>\
others a simple subst., (see جَدَّ,)] Seriousness,<br>\
or earnestness, contr. of هَزْلٌ, (S, A, Msb, K,) in<br>\
speech. (Msb.) Hence, ثَلَاثٌ جِدُّهُنَّ جِدٌّ وَهَزْلُهُنَّ<br>\
جِدٌّ [There are three things in relation to which<br>\
what is serious is serious and what is jesting is<br>\
serious]: a saying of Mohammad, whereby he<br>\
forbade a man&#39;s divorcing and emancipating and<br>\
marrying and then retracting, saying “ I was<br>\
jesting; ” as was customary in the time of<br>\
paganism. (Msb.) أَجِدَّكَ and ↓ أَجَدَّكَ signify<br>\
the same; (S;) but the former is the more<br>\
chaste; (TA;) جِدّ and جَدّ being thus used only<br>\
as prefixed nouns: (S, K:) As says that the<br>\
meaning is, أَبِجِدٍّ مِنْكَ هٰذَا [Does this proceed<br>\
from thee in seriousness, or in earnest?]; and<br>\
that جِدّ is put in the accus. case because of the<br>\
rejection of the [prep.] ب: AA says that the<br>\
meaning is, مَا لَكَ أَجِدًّا مِنْكَ [What aileth thee?<br>\
Doth it proceed from thee in seriousness, or in<br>\
earnest?]; and that جدّ is put in the accus. case<br>\
as an inf. n.: Th says that the phrase as it occurs<br>\
in poetry is أَجِدَّكَ, with kesr: (S:) but when<br>\
it occurs with وَ [in the place of أَ, or with أَ in the<br>\
sense of وَ, as a particle denoting an oath,] it is<br>\
↓ وَجَدِّكَ [or أَجَدِّكَ], with fet-h: (S, K:) yon<br>\
say, وَجَدِّكَ لَا تَفْعَلْ, (K, in the CK وَجَدَّكَ,)<br>\
meaning, By thy grandfather, do not [such a<br>\
thing]: or by thy fortune, or good fortune, do<br>\
not: (TA:) also, when you say, أَجِدَّكَ لَا تَفْعَلْ,<br>\
[or أَجِدِّكَ, for أَ (q. v.) is substituted for a particle<br>\
of swearing, as in أَللّٰهِ لَأَفْعَلَنَّ,] the meaning is,<br>\
I adjure thee by thy truth, (Lth, K,) and by thy<br>\
seriousness, or earnestness, (Lth, TA,) do not:<br>\
and when you say, لَا تَفْعَلْ ↓ أَجَدَّكَ, [or أَجَدِّكَ,]<br>\
the meaning is, I adjure thee by thy fortune, or<br>\
good fortune, do not: (Lth, K:) Aboo- &#39;Alee<br>\
Esh-Shalowbeenee asserts that it implies the signification of an oath. (MF.) In the phrase<br>\
اجدّك لا تَفْعَلُ, AAF says, we may consider<br>\
لا تفعل as put in the place of a denotative of state;<br>\
or the phrase may be originally اجدّك أَنْ لَا تَفْعَلَ,<br>\
ان being suppressed, and its government annulled:<br>\
[therefore it may be rendered, in the former case,<br>\
Is it with seriousness on thy part, thou doing<br>\
such a thing? and in the latter case, Is it with<br>\
seriousness on thy part that thou will not do such<br>\
a thing? i. e. dost thou mean seriously that thou<br>\
will not do it? or in this case, اجدّك may be<br>\
used as a form of adjuration in one of the senses<br>\
explained above, and لَا تَفْعَلُ may mean, that<br>\
thou do not such a thing; or اجدّك may mean<br>\
وَجَدَّكَ, (explained above, and so in the three exs.<br>\
below,) and لَا تَفْعَلُ, thou wilt not do it:] and,<br>\
as AHei says, there is here a nice point, which is<br>\
this; that the noun [meaning the pronoun] to<br>\
which جدّ is prefixed should agree in person<br>\
with the verb which follows it; so that one should<br>\
say, اجدِّى لَا أُكْرِمُكَ, and اجدّكَ لَا تَفْعَلُ, and<br>\
اجدّهُ لَا يَزُورُنَا; because جدّ is an inf. n. corroborating the proposition that follows it. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
[and in this case, likewise, accord. to some an inf. n.,<br>\
but accord. to others a simple subst., (see, again,<br>\
جَدَّ,)] A striving, labour, or toil; exertion of one&#39;s<br>\
self, or of one&#39;s power or efforts or endeavours or<br>\
ability; vigorousness, strenuousness, laboriousness,<br>\
diligence, studiousness, sedulousness, earnestness,<br>\
or energy; painstaking, or extraordinary painstaking; (S, L, Msb, K;) in affairs, (S,) or in an<br>\
affair. (Msb, K.) Hence, جِدًّا [meaning In a<br>\
great, or an extraordinary, degree; greatly,<br>\
much, exceedingly, or extraordinarily; very;<br>\
very greatly, or very much; extremely]; as in<br>\
the phrase, (Msb,) فُلَانٌ مُحْسِنٌ جِدًّا [Such a<br>\
one is beneficent in a great, or an extraordinary,<br>\
degree; very, exceedingly, or extremely, beneficent]: you should not say جَدًّا. (S, Msb. * [In<br>\
my copy of the Msb, it is محسن جدّا بالفتح:<br>\
but the context shows that there is an omission<br>\
here, and that, after جدّا, we should read, as in<br>\
the S, وَلَا تَقُلْ جَدًّا.]) جِدًّا [in a phrase of this<br>\
kind] is put in the accus. case as an inf. n. [of<br>\
which the verb is understood; so that, in the ex.<br>\
given above, the proper meaning is, يَجِدُّ فِى<br>\
الإِحْسَانِ جِدًّا striving in beneficence with a great<br>\
striving]; because it is not from the same root<br>\
as the preceding word, nor is it identical with it<br>\
[in meaning]. (L.) You say also, فِى هٰذَا خَطَرٌ<br>\
جِدَّ عَظِيمٍ, meaning عَظِيمٌ جِدًّا [(assumed tropical:)  In this is a<br>\

(L.) And هٰذَا عَالِمٌ جِدَّ عَالِمٍ This is a learned<br>\
man, an extremely [or a very] learned man.<br>\
(L, * K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  Haste. (S, L, K, TA.) So in<br>\

haste in an affair. (S, L, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Executed<br>\

[meaning مُحَقَّقٌ فِيهِ وَمُبَالَغٌ فِيهِ; (see جَدَّ فِى أَمْرِهِ;)<br>\
جِدٌّ thus used as an epithet having an intensive<br>\
signification because it is originally an inf. n.,<br>\
or as some say, a simple subst.]: (L, K:) applied<br>\
in this sense to a punishment: (L:) and also<br>\
applied to a pace. (K in art. نص.)<br>\

in colour from the rest of the mountain, (S,)<br>\
white and black and red; (Fr, TA;) as also in<br>\
the sky: (A, TA:) pl. جُدَدٌ, (Fr, S,) occurring<br>\
in the Kur xxxv. 25; (S;) where some read<br>\

with جُدَّةٌ; and some, جَدَدٌ [q. v.]. (Bd.) ―<br>\

-b4-  A collar upon the neck of a dog:<br>\

in a prov., مَنْ سَلَكَ الجَدَدَ أَمِنَ العِثَارَ [He who<br>\
walks along hard, or hard and level, ground is<br>\
secure from stumbling]; (S, TA;) meaning, he<br>\
who pursues the course marked out by common<br>\
consent is secure from stumbling. (TA.) And<br>\

جَدَادٌ and ↓ جِدَادٌ The cutting off of the fruit<br>\

هٰذَا زَمَنُ الجَدَادِ and الجِدَادِ [This is the time, or<br>\
season, of the cutting off of the fruit of the palmtrees]. (S, A, Msb. *) Some say that جداد signifies particularly [as above,] the cutting off [of<br>\
the fruit] of palm-trees; and جذاذ, the cutting<br>\
off of all fruits, in a general sense: others say<br>\
that they signify the same. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The<br>\
time, or season, of the cutting off of the fruit of<br>\
palm-trees. (S, * L.) You say جَدَادٌ and جِدَادٌ,<br>\
like صَرَامٌ and صِرَامٌ, and قَطَافٌ and قِطَافٌ; (Ks,<br>\
S;) whence it seems as though the measures<br>\
فَعَالٌ and فِعَالٌ were uniformly applicable to every<br>\
noun signifying the time of the action; such<br>\
nouns being likened to أَوَانٌ and إِوَانٌ. (S.)<br>\
جِدَادٌ: see جَدَادٌ, and جَادٌّ.<br>\
جَدُودٌ, (ISk, S, A, K,) or جَدُودَةٌ, (L,) Having<br>\
little milk, (ISk, S,) or not from any imperfection; (L;) applied to a ewe, (ISk, S, K,) but<br>\
not to a she-goat; the epithet مَصُورٌ being used<br>\

أَبِى حُبِّى سُلَيْمَى أَنْ يَبِيدَا<br>\
وَأَمْسَى حَبْلُهَا خَلَقًا جَدِيدَا<br>\
[My love of Suleymà hath refused to perish; but<br>\
her cord (i. e. her tie of affection to me) hath<br>\
become worn out and cut]: (S:) [as جديد signifies “new” more commonly than &quot;cut,&quot;] this<br>\
verse appears as though it involved a contradiction. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to a garment, or a piece<br>\
of cloth [sufficient for a garment or the like],<br>\
Newly cut off [from the web] by the weaver:<br>\
(S, K:) and so (without ة, S) applied to a<br>\
مِلْحَفَة; (S, A;) thus applied to a fem. n. because<br>\
syn. with ↓ مَجْدُودَةٌ; (S, ISd;) or, accord. to<br>\
Sb, because by ملحفة in this case is meant إِزَار,<br>\
and for a like reason in like cases; (Ham p. 555;)<br>\
but one also says جَدِيدَةٌ; (ISd;) and accord. to<br>\
some, جديد is of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of<br>\
the measure فَاعِلٌ, and therefore the ة is regularly<br>\
affixed to it: (Ham ubi suprà:) the pl. is جُدُدٌ (Mbr,<br>\
Th, S, A, K) and جُدَدٌ; (AZ, A&#39;Obeyd, Mbr;) but<br>\
the former is the more common. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
hence, (L,) applied to a garment, (L, TA,) or a thing,<br>\
(S, Msb,) New; contr. of قَدِيمٌ, (Msb,) or contr.<br>\
of خَلَقٌ; (S, L;) from جِدَّةٌ as contr. of بِلًى:<br>\
(K:) pl. [of pauc.] أَجِدَّةٌ and [of mult.] جُدُدٌ and<br>\
جُدَدٌ. (L.) You say, أَصْبَحَتْ خَلَقُهُمْ جُدُدًا, a<br>\
phrase mentioned by Lh, meaning خُلْقَانُهُمْ جُدُدًا<br>\
[i. e. Their old worn-out garments became replaced<br>\
by new]: or جُدُدًا may be here put for جَدِيدًا.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And hence, (TA,) الجَدِيدَانِ and ↓ الأَجَدَّانِ<br>\
The night and the day; (S, Msb, K;) because<br>\
they never become impaired by time. (TA.) You<br>\
say, لَا أَفْعَلُهُ مَا اخْتَلَفَ الجَدِيدَانِ and ↓ الأَجَدَّانِ<br>\
[I will not do it while the day and the night<br>\
succeed each other]: (S:) or مَا كَرَّ الجَدِيدَانِ<br>\
and الأَجَدَّانِ [while the day and the night return<br>\
time after time: i. e., ever]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Hence<br>\
likewise, جَدِيدٌ also signifies A thing of which<br>\
one has had no knowledge. (L.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And hence,<br>\
(L,) الجَدِيدُ signifies Death: (K:) or is applied<br>\
as an epithet to death, in the dial. of Hudheyl.<br>\
(L.) Accord. to Akh and El-Mugháfis El-Báhilee,<br>\
جَدِيدُ المَوْتِ means The commencement of death.<br>\
(L.)<br>\
-A2-  Also The face, or surface, of the earth,<br>\
or ground; [as though it were cut;] (S, K, TA;)<br>\

things, called جَدِيدَتَانِ: (S:) or the جديدتان<br>\
consist of the felt that is stuck, or attached, in the<br>\
inner side of a horse&#39;s and of a camel&#39;s saddle:<br>\
(L:) but جديدة thus applied is a post-classical<br>\
word: the [classical] Arabs say جَدْيَةٌ, (S,) or,<br>\
as in J&#39;s own handwriting, جَدِيَّةٌ. (So in the<br>\
margin of a copy of the S.)<br>\

or bounds, much, (S, M,) and creaks by night,<br>\
(TA,) and bears a resemblance to the جَرَاد [or<br>\
locust]: (S, M, K:) and a certain insect like the<br>\
جُنْدَب, (M, L, K,) except that it is generally<br>\
blackish, and short, but in some instances inclining<br>\

no means shall any one of you take the property of<br>\
his brother in play and in earnest]; by which is<br>\
meant taking a thing without meaning to steal it,<br>\
but meaning to vex and anger the owner, so that<br>\
the taker is in play with respect to theft, but in<br>\
earnest in annoying. (TA in art. لعب.) ―<br>\
-b2-  فُلَانٌ جَادٌّ<br>\
Such a one is striving, labouring, or toiling;<br>\
exerting himself or his power or efforts or endeavours or ability; &amp;c. (TA.) And ↓ فُلَانٌ جَادٌّ مُجِدٌّ,<br>\

of which the produce, cut therefrom, is a hundred<br>\
camel-loads: جَادٌّ being here used in the sense of<br>\

He gave to &#39;Áïsheh palm-trees of which the quantity<br>\
of the dates cut therefrom was a hundred camel-loads; but the phrase heard from the Arabs is<br>\
جَادَّ عِشْرِينَ: the former is like the saying هٰذِهِ<br>\
