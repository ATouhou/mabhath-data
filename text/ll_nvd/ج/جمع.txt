or dispersed, state; (Fr, S;) and a number of<br>\
men; (Fr;) as also ↓ جمّع; [or this has only an<br>\
intensive signification;] and ↓ اجمع. (TA.) [See<br>\

state of union, after separation; and particularly,<br>\

-b7-  جَمَعَ أَمْرَهُ:<br>\
see 4. ―<br>\
-b8-  [جَمَعَ also signifies He composed, arranged, or settled, a thing, or an affair; as in the<br>\
phrase جَمَعَ اللّٰهُ شَمْلَهُ: see art. شمل. ―<br>\
-b9-  Also It<br>\

-b10-  Also<br>\
He pluralized a word; made it to have a plural,<br>\
or plurals. (The Lexicons passim.)<br>\
2<br>\
جمّع, (Fr, Msb,) inf. n. تَجْمِيعٌ, (K,) He<br>\
collected; brought, or gathered, together; gathered<br>\
up; assembled; congregated; mustered; drew together; or contracted; [thus I render جَمَعَ, as<br>\
explained above;] much; with much, or extraordinary, energy, or effectiveness, or the like;<br>\
vigorously; or well. (Bd in civ. 2; Msb, K.)<br>\
Thus in the Kur [civ. 2], الَّذِى جَمَّعَ مَالًا وَعَدَّدَهُ<br>\
(S, * Bd) Who hath collected much wealth, and<br>\
hath made it a provision for the casualties of<br>\
fortune, or reckoned it time after time: (Bd:)<br>\
[or who hath amassed, or accumulated, wealth,<br>\
&amp;c.:] or who hath gained, acquired, or earned,<br>\
wealth, &amp;c.; thus differing from جَمَعَ, explained<br>\
above: but it is allowable to say مَالًا ↓ جَمَعَ,<br>\
without teshdeed; (Fr;) and thus it is [generally]<br>\
read in this passage of the Kur. (Bd.) See also 1.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  حَمَّعَتْ, (TA,) inf. n. as above, (K,) She (a<br>\

the Friday, (S, Mgh, Msb,) or with the congregation [then collected], (Mgh,) and performed the<br>\
prayers [with the congregation] on that day. (S,<br>\

-b4-  Hence the saying, أَوَّلُ جُمْعَةٍ جُمِّعَتْ فِى<br>\
الإِسْلَامُ بَعْدَ المَدِينَةِ بِجُؤَاثِى [The first Friday<br>\

the observance thereof in El-Medeeneh, was in<br>\
Ju-áthà]. (TA.)<br>\

(TK) [and جِمَاعٌ], He combined with him,<br>\
(مَعَهُ ↓ اجتمع, S, K, TA,) and aided him, (TA,)<br>\
to do such a thing. (S, * K, * TA.) It is said in a<br>\
trad. of Aboo-Dharr, وَلَا جِمَاعَ لَنَا فِيمَا بَعْدُ i. e.<br>\
لَنَا ↓ لَااجْتِمَاعَ [which may mean Nor any combining, or nor any coming together, for us afterwards: see 8]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  جامع امْرَأَتَهُ, (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. مُجَامَعَةٌ (S, Msb, K) and جِمَاعٌ, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) (tropical:)  He lay with his wife; compressed her.<br>\
(S, * Mgh, * Msb, K. *) [The latter inf. n. is the<br>\
more common as meaning Coïtus conjugalis, or<br>\
the act of compressing].<br>\
-A2-  اِسْتَأْجَرَ الأَجِيرَ مُجَامَعةً,<br>\
and جِمَاعًا, He hired the hireling for a certain<br>\
pay every week. (Lh, * TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اجمع: see 1. أَجْمَعْتُ الشَّىْءَ signifies I put<br>\
the thing together; such, for instance, as spoil,<br>\
or plunder. (S.) You say, أَجْمَعْتُ النَّهْبِ, meaning I collected together from every quarter the<br>\
camels taken as spoil from the people to whom<br>\
they belonged, and drove them away: (AHeyth:)<br>\
or إِجْمَاعٌ signifies [simply] the driving of camels<br>\
together, or collectively. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الإِجْمَاعُ also<br>\
signifies The composing and settling a thing which<br>\
has been discomposed [and unsettled]; as an<br>\
opinion upon which one determines, resolves, or<br>\
decides: (TA:) or جَعْلُ الأَمْرِ جَمِيعًا بَعْدَ تَفَرُّقِهِ,<br>\
(AHeyth, K,) i. e. the determining, resolving,<br>\
or deciding, upon an affair, so as to make it<br>\
firmly settled, [after it had been unsettled in<br>\
the mind, or] after considering what might be its<br>\
issues, or results, and saying at one time, I will<br>\
do thus, and at another time, I will do thus.<br>\
(AHeyth.) You say, أَجْمَعْتُ الأَمْرَ, (Ks, S, Mgh, *<br>\
Msb, K,) and عَلَى الأَمْرِ, (Mgh, * Msb, K,) I<br>\
determined, resolved, or decided, upon the affair;<br>\
(Ks, S, Mgh, * Msb, K;) as though I collected<br>\
myself, or my mind, for it; (TA;) as, for instance, a journeying, and a fasting, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
and a going forth, and a tarrying or an abiding;<br>\
(TA;) and in like manner, أَمْرَهُ ↓ جَمَعَ He determined, resolved, or decided, upon his affair; as,<br>\
for instance, a fasting: (TA:) and أَجْمَعْتُ الرَّأْىِ<br>\
I determined, or settled, the opinion. (TA.) You<br>\
say also, أَجْمِعْ أَمْرَكَ وَلَا تَدَعْهُ مُنْتَشِرًا [Determine<br>\
thou, or decide, upon thine affair, and do not<br>\
leave it unsettled]. (S.) The saying, in the Kur<br>\
[x. 72], فَأَجْمَعُوا أَمْرَكُمْ وَشُرَكَآءَ كُمْ means Then<br>\
determine ye, or resolve, or decide, upon your<br>\
affair, (Fr, Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, Bd,) and prepare for<br>\
it, (Fr,) or اِجْعَلُوهُ جَمِيعًا, [which has the former<br>\
of these meanings, as shown above,] (AHeyth,)<br>\
and call ye your companions, (Fr, S, Bd, K,)<br>\
شركاءكم being governed in the accus. case by<br>\
the verb understood, (Bd, TA,) becanse the verb<br>\
in the text is not used with شركاء for its object,<br>\
(S, K,) but only the unaugmented verb: (S:) or<br>\
the meaning is then determine ye, with your companions, upon your affair; (Bd, K;) so says<br>\
Aboo-Is-hák, adding that what Fr says is erroneous: (TA:) or then determine ye upon your<br>\
affair and the affair of your companions, for وَأَمْرَ<br>\
شُرَكَائِكُمْ. (Bd.) It is also said that the phrase,<br>\
in the Kur [xx. 67], فَأَجْمِعُوا كَيْدَكُمْ means<br>\
Therefore determine ye, or resolve, or decide,<br>\
upon your artifice, or stratagem: (TA:) but<br>\
some read كَيْدَكُمْ ↓ فَاجْمَعُوا, (Bd, TA,) meaning<br>\
therefore combine ye all your artifice; leave<br>\
nothing thereof unexerted; (TA;) and this latter<br>\
reading is favoured by the phrase كَيْدَهُ ↓ فَجَمَع<br>\
[in verse 62 of the same ch.]. (Bd.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The<br>\
agreeing, or uniting, in opinion. (K, * TA.) You<br>\
say, أَجْمَعُوا عَلَى الأَمْرِ meaning They agreed, or<br>\
were of one mind or opinion, upon, or respecting,<br>\
the affair; (Mgh, Msb;) [and so عَلَيْهِ ↓ اجتمعوا;<br>\
and عليه ↓ تجمّعوا.] ―<br>\
-b4-  Also The preparing [a<br>\
thing], or making [it] ready; syn. الإِعْدَادُ. (K,<br>\
TA. [In the CK, erroneously, الاَعْدَادُ.]) You<br>\
say, أَجْمَعْتُ كَذَا I prepared, or made ready,<br>\
such a thing. (TA.) And أَجْمِعُوا أَمْرَكُمْ Prepare<br>\
ye for your affair. (Fr.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also The binding<br>\
the teats of a she-camel all together with the صِرَار,<br>\
q. v. (K.) You say, اجمع بِالنَّاقَةِ, (S, TA,) and<br>\
اجمع النَّاقَةِ, (TA,) He so bound the teats of the<br>\
she-camel; (S, TA;) and so أَكْمَشَ بِهَا. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b6-  Also The drying [a thing]; drying [it] up;<br>\
making [it] dry; syn. التَّجْفِيفُ وَالإِيبَاسُ. (K<br>\
TA. [In the CK, erroneously, التَخْفُيفُ والاِيْناسُ.])<br>\
Hence the saying of Aboo-Wejzeh Es-Saadee,<br>\
وَأَجْمَعَتِ الهَوَاجِرُ كُلَّ رَجْعٍ<br>\
مِنَ الأَجْمَادِ وَالدَّمِثِ البَثَآءِ<br>\
i.e. [And the vehement mid-day-heats] dried up<br>\
every pool left by a torrent [of the hard and<br>\
elevated grounds and of the soft and even ground].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  اجمع المَطَرُ الأَرْضِ The rain made the<br>\
whole of the land, both its soft tracts and its hard<br>\
tracts, to flow: (K:) and in like manner you<br>\
say, أَجْمَعَتِ الأَرْضُ سَائِلَةً The land flowed in its<br>\
soft tracts [as well as in its hard tracts; i. e.,<br>\
in every part]. (TA.) [See also 10.]<br>\
5<br>\
تَجَمَّعَ see 8, in three places: and see also 4, latter<br>\
half.<br>\
7<br>\
انجمع عَنِ النَّاسِ [He withdrew himself from<br>\
men]. (TA in art. قبض.)<br>\
8<br>\
اجتمع It (a thing in a scattered or dispersed<br>\
state, S, and a number of men, Msb, [and a<br>\
number of things,]) became collected, brought<br>\
together, gathered together, gathered up, assembled, congregated, mustered, drawn together, or<br>\
contracted; or it collected, collected itself together,<br>\
gathered itself together, came together, assembled,<br>\
congregated, drew itself together, contracted itself; coalesced; combined; (K, TA;) so that the<br>\
several parts or portions became near [or close]<br>\
together; (TA;) as also اِجْدَمَعَ, (K,) with د<br>\
[substituted for the ت]; (TA;) and ↓ تجمّع and<br>\
↓ استجمع signify the same: (Msb, K:) and ↓ تجمّعوا<br>\
signifies they became collected, &amp;c., [from several<br>\
places, or] hence and thence. (S, K:) [See also 10.]<br>\
You say also, اجتمع مَعَهُ (Mgh) and بِهِ (Msb)<br>\
[meaning He was, or became, in company with<br>\
him; came together with him; met with him; met<br>\
him; had a meeting, or an interview, with him].<br>\
And اجتمع مَعَهُ عَلَى أَمْرِ كَذَا: (S, K:) see 3,<br>\
first sentence: and see the sentence there next<br>\
following. And in like manner, عَلَى ↓ تجمّعوا<br>\
فُلَانٍ They combined, conspired, or leagued, together<br>\
against such a one. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA in art. ضفر.)<br>\
[See also اجتمعوا عَلَى الأَمْرِ in 4, latter half.]<br>\
You also say, اِجْتَمَعَتِ آرَاؤُهُمْ عَلَى الأَمْرِ [Their<br>\
opinions agreed together, or were in unison, upon,<br>\
or respecting, the affair]. (Er-Rághib.) And<br>\
اِجْتَمَعَتْ شَرَائِطُ الإِمَامَةِ The conditions of the office<br>\
of Imám occurred together [or were combined, or<br>\
they coexisted, in such a case]; as also ↓ اِسْتَجْمَعَتْ.<br>\
(Msb: [but it is implied in the Mgh that the<br>\
latter verb in this sense is not of established<br>\
authority.]) [See a similar ex. voce ارتفع.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[He, or it, was, or became, compact in make or<br>\
frame, compressed, contracted, or the like. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And hence,] He (a man) attained to his full<br>\
state of manly vigour, and his beard became fullgrown. (K, TA.) The verb is not thus used in<br>\
speaking of a woman. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence also,]<br>\
اجتمع فِى الحَاجَةِ [He was quick and vigorous<br>\
in executing the needful affair, or in accomplishing that which was wanted; as though he compacted his frame, and collected all his energy:<br>\
see مَشَى مُجْتَمِعًا, below: and see also 10]. (TA<br>\
in art. كمش.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence also,] اِجْتَمَعَتِ القِدْرُ<br>\
The cooking-pot boiled. (Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [Hence also,<br>\
اجتمع said of a thing, or an affair, It was, or<br>\
became, composed, arranged, or settled.]<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَجْمَعَ ↓ استجمع كُلَّ مَجْمَعٍ [He desired, or<br>\
demanded, the collecting together of every body of<br>\
soldiers; or he summoned together every body of<br>\
soldiers]: said of him who demands, or summons,<br>\
armies, or military forces. (S, TA.) [But this<br>\
usage of the verb is perhaps post-classical: for<br>\
Mtr says,] With respect to the saying of ElAbeewardee,<br>\
شَآمِيَّةٌ تَسْتَجْمِعُ الشَّوْلَ حَرْجَفُ<br>\
[A north wind, cold and vehement, inviting to<br>\
collect themselves together the she-camels whose<br>\
milk has dried up, they having passed seven or<br>\
eight months since bringing forth, or since pregnancy], it seems that he has compared this verb<br>\
with the generality of others of the same class,<br>\
[and so derived the meaning in which he has<br>\
here used it,] or that he heard it [in that sense]<br>\
from the people of the cities, or towns, or villages,<br>\
and cultivated lands. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  استجمع used<br>\
intransitively is syn. with اجتمع, which see in<br>\
two places, and تجمّع. (Msb, K.) ―<br>\

-b4-  اِسْتَجْمَعَتْ لَهُ<br>\
أُمُورُهُ His affairs, or circumstances, all combined<br>\
in a manner pleasing to him. (Mgh, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
استجمع الفَرَسُ جَرْيًا (S, Mgh, K) The horse<br>\
exerted all his force, or energy, in running:<br>\
(K, TA:) the last word is here in the accus. case<br>\
as a specificative. (Mgh.) You say also, اِسْتَجْمَعُوا<br>\
لَهُمْ, meaning They exerted [all] their strength,<br>\
force, or energy, for fighting them: and hence,<br>\
لَكُمْ ↓ إِنَّ النَّاسِ قَدْ جَمَعُوا [app. meaning Verily<br>\
the men, or people, have exerted all their strength<br>\
for fighting you]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  استجمع القَوْمُ<br>\
The people, or company of men, all went away,<br>\
not one of them remaining; like as one says of a<br>\
valley flowing in every place thereof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
استجمع البَقْلُ The herbs, or leguminous plants,<br>\
all dried up. (TA.)<br>\
جَمْعٌ inf. n. of 1. (S, &amp;c.) [Hence,] يَوْمُ الجَمْعِ<br>\
The day of resurrection [when all mankind will<br>\
be collected together]. (IDrd, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, without the article ال, A name of El-Muzdelifeh<br>\
[between &#39;Arafát and Minè]; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
determinate, like عَرَفَاتُ: (TA:) so called because<br>\
people collect themselves there; (S, Msb;) or<br>\
because Adam there met with Eve (Mgh, Msb)<br>\
after they had fallen [from Paradise]: (TA:)<br>\
[or, app., a name of the tract from &#39;Arafát to<br>\
Minè inclusive of these two places: and hence,]<br>\
يَوْمُ جَمْعٍ the day of &#39;Arafeh [when the pilgrims<br>\
halt at Mount &#39;Arafát]: and أَيَّامُ جَمْعٍ the days<br>\
of Minè. (IDrd, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  As an inf. n. used as a<br>\
subst., properly so termed, (S, * Mgh, Msb,) it<br>\
also signifies A collection; a number together;<br>\
an assembly; a company, troop, congregated or<br>\
collective body, party, or group; a mass; syn.<br>\
↓ جَمَاعَةٌ, (S, Mgh, L, Msb, K,) of men; (S, L,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ مَجْمَعٌ (L, Msb, TA) and ↓ مَجْمِعٌ<br>\
(Msb) and ↓ مَجْمَعَةٌ (L, TA) and ↓ جَمِيعٌ: (O,<br>\
K:) but ↓ جَمَاعَةٌ is also used as signifying a<br>\
collection, a number together, or an assemblage,<br>\
of other things than men; [of beasts, as camels,<br>\
horses and the like, bulls and cows, and antelopes,<br>\
gazelles, &amp;c., i. e. a herd, troop, or drove; of<br>\
dogs, i. e. a pack; of sheep and goats, i. e. a<br>\
flock; of birds, i. e. a flock or bevy; of bees,<br>\
and locusts, &amp;c., i. e. a swarm;] and even of<br>\
trees, and of plants; (L, TA;) it signifies a collection, or an assemblage, or aggregate, of any things,<br>\
consisting of many and of few; (Msb;) [as also<br>\
↓ مَجْمُوعٌ and ↓ مَجْمَعٌ;] a number, a plurality,<br>\
and a multitude, of any things: (TA:) the pl.<br>\
of جَمْعٌ is جُمُوعٌ. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And<br>\
particularly, An army; a military force; (TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ جَمِيعٌ. (S, K.) Whence the phrase, in<br>\
a trad., لَهُ سَهْمٌ جَمْعٌ, [or, more probably, سَهْمُ<br>\
جَمْعٍ,] meaning For him or shall be, the like<br>\
of an army&#39;s share of the spoil. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also<br>\
The plural of a thing [or word; i. e. a proper<br>\
plural, according to the grammarians; and also<br>\
applied by the lexicologists to a quasi-plural<br>\
noun, which the grammarians distinguish by the<br>\
terms اِسْمُ جَمْعٍ and جَمْعٌ لُغَوِىٌّ]; and so ↓ جِمَاعٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) and ↓ جَمِيعٌ, except that this last is what<br>\
is termed اِسْمٌ لَازِمٌ [app. meaning a subst. which<br>\
does not govern another as its complement in the<br>\
gen. case like as جَمْعٌ and جِمَاعٌ do, being thus<br>\
likened to what is termed فِعْلٌ لَازِمٌ, i. e. an intransitive verb; so that you say of الخِبَآءُ, for<br>\
instance, الجَمِيعُ الأَخْبِيَةُ the plural is الاخبية;<br>\
for in this manner I always find it used when it<br>\
has this signification, which is frequently the case<br>\
in several of the older lexicons, and in some<br>\
others; not جَمِيعُ الخِبَآءِ الأَخْبِيَةُ]; (TA;) [whereas] you say, [جَمْعُ الخِبَآءِ الأَخْبِيَةُ and] ↓ جِمَاعُ<br>\
الخِبَآءِ الأَخْبِيَةُ, (S, K,) i. e. the جَمْع [or plural]<br>\
of الخباء is الخِبَآءِ; (K) for ↓ الجِمَاعُ is what<br>\
comprises a number [of things]. (S, K.) See<br>\
also this last word below. ―<br>\
-b6-  And see also the<br>\
next paragraph, in three places. ―<br>\
-b7-  The worst<br>\
sort of dates; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) because they<br>\
are collected together and mixed, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
from among the dates of fifty palm-trees:<br>\
(Mgh:) and afterwards, by predominant usage,<br>\
[any] bad dates: (Mgh, * Msb:) or a certain<br>\
kind of dates (K, TA) mixed together, of several<br>\
sorts, not in request, and not mixed but for their<br>\
badness: (TA:) or it signifies, (Mgh, K,) or signifies also, (S, Msb,) palm-trees (As, S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K) of any kind, (As, Mgh, Msb,) growing<br>\
from the date-stones, (S, K,) of which the name<br>\
is unknown. (As, S, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Red<br>\
gum; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K;) [app. because collected<br>\
and mixed with gum of lighter colour.] ―<br>\
-b9-  The<br>\
milk of any camel having her udder bound with<br>\
the صِرَار [q. v.]; ([i. e. the milk that collects in<br>\
the udder so bound;] that of any camel not having<br>\
her udder bound therewith is called فُوَاقٌ;) as<br>\
also ↓ جَمِيعٌ. (K.)<br>\
الجُمْعُ, (TA, and EM p. 102,) and جُمْعُ الكَفِّ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) and الكَفِّ ↓ جِمْعُ, (Msb, K, and so<br>\
in the margin of a copy of the S, as mentioned in<br>\
the TA,) and الكَفِّ ↓ جَمْعُ, (Msb,) The fist; the<br>\
hand clinched; (S, Msb, K;) the hand with the<br>\
fingers put together and contracted in the palm:<br>\
(TA, * and EM ubi suprà:) pl. أَجْمَاعٌ. (K.) You<br>\
say, ضَرَبْتُهُ بِجُمْعِ كَفِّى I beat him, or struck him,<br>\
with my fist. (S, Msb. *) And ضَرَبُوهُ بِأَجْمَاعِهِمْ<br>\
They beat him, or struck him, with their [clinched]<br>\
hands. (TA.) And جَآءَ فُلَانٌ بِقُبْضَةٍ مِلْءٍ جُمْعِهِ<br>\
Such a one came with a quantity in his grasp as<br>\
much as filled his clinched hand. (S, TA.) And<br>\
جُمْعُ الكَفِّ signifies [also] The quantity that a<br>\
hand grasps, of money &amp;c. (Ham p. 778.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
أَخَذْتُ فُلَانًا بِجُمْعِ ثِيَابِهِ, (S, Msb, *) and ↓ بِجَمْعِ<br>\
ثِيَابِهِ, (Msb,) i. e. [I took, or seized, such a one]<br>\

-b3-  أَمْرُهُمْ بِجُمْعِ, and ↓ بِجِمْعٍ, (tropical:)  Their affair, or<br>\
case, is concealed, (S, K,) undivulged by them, and<br>\
unknown by any one [beside them]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\

away wholly; all of it. (K, TA.) ―<br>\

yet a virgin. (TA.) And مَاتَتْ بِجُمْعٍ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) and ↓ بِجِمْعٍ, (Ks, S, Msb, K,) and<br>\
↓ بِجَمْعٍ, (K,) She died a virgin: (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K:) or it signifies, (S, K,) or signifies also,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) she died being with child; (AZ, S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) whether suffering the pains of<br>\
parturition or not: (AZ:) or heavy with child:<br>\
(K:) occurring in the first sense, (Mgh, TA,)<br>\
or, as some say, in the last, (TA,) in a trad., in<br>\
which it is said that a woman who so dies is a<br>\
martyr: (Mgh, TA:) it properly signifies she<br>\
died with something comprised in her, not separated from her, whether it were a burden in the<br>\
womb, or her maidenhead: (Sgh:) [the pl. is<br>\
أَجْمَاعٌ; for] you say, مَاتَتِ النِّسَآءُ بِأَجْمَاعٍ The<br>\
women died [being virgins: or] being with child.<br>\
(AZ.) You say also, نَاقَةٌ جُمْعٌ A she-camel with<br>\

جُمَعٌ pl. of جَمْعَآءُ, fem. of أَجْمَعُ [q. v.].<br>\
جُمْعَةٌ is [a subst.] from الاِجْتِمَاعُ, like as [its<br>\
contr.] فُرْقَةٌ is [ a subst.] from الااِفْتِرَاقُ: (Mgh:)<br>\
and signifies A state of union, agreement, congruity, or congregation: or sociableness, socialness, familiarity, companionableness, companionship, fellowship, friendship, and amity: syn.<br>\
أُلْفَةٌ: as in the saying, أَدَامَ اللّٰهُ جُمْعَةَ مَا بَيْنَكُمَا<br>\
[May God make permanent the state of union,<br>\
&amp;c., subsisting between you two]. (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (Mgh,) يَوْمُ الجُمْعَةِ, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) the original form, (TA,) of the dial. of<br>\
&#39;Okeyl; (Msb, TA;) and يَوْمُ الجُمُعَةِ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) the most chaste form, (TA,) of the dial. of<br>\
El-Hijáz; (Msb, TA;) and يَوْمُ الجُمَعَةِ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) of the dial. of Benoo-Temeem; (Msb, TA;)<br>\
and, in consequence of frequency of usage, الجُمَعَةُ<br>\
alone; (Mgh;) A well-known day; (K;) [the<br>\
day of the congregation; i. e. Friday;] formerly<br>\
called (TA) the day of العَرُوبَة: (S, TA:) called<br>\
يوم الجمعة because of the congregating of the<br>\
people thereon: (Msb:) Th asserts that the first<br>\
who named it thus was Kaab Ibn-Lu-eí; and he<br>\
is related to have said that it was thus called<br>\
because Kureysh used to gather themselves together to Kuseí, [on that day,] in [the building<br>\
called] دَارُ النَّدْوَةِ: (TA:) accord. to the R, Kaab<br>\
Ibn-Lu-eí was the first who collected a congregation on the day of العروبة, which was not called<br>\
الجمعة save since the coming of El-Islám; [or it<br>\
was not generally thus called before El-Islám;<br>\
for it is added,] and he was the first who named<br>\
it الجمعة; for Kureysh used to congregate to<br>\
him on this day, and he used to preach to them,<br>\
and to put them in mind of the mission of the<br>\
apostle of God, informing them that he should be<br>\
of his descendants, and bidding them to follow<br>\
him and to believe in him: (TA:) or, as some<br>\
say, it was thus called in the time of El-Islám<br>\
because of their congregating [thereon] in the<br>\
mosque: accord. to a trad., the Ansár named it<br>\
thus, because of their congregating thereon:<br>\
(TA:) or it was thus named because God collected<br>\
thereon the materials of which Adam was created:<br>\
(I &#39;Ab:) those who say الجُمَعَةُ regard it as an<br>\
epithet, meaning that this day collects men much;<br>\
comparing it to هُمَزَةٌ and لُمَزَةٌ and ضُحَكَةٌ: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. is جُمَعٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and جُمْعَاتٌ<br>\
(Msb, K) and جُمُعَاتٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and<br>\
جُمَعَاتٌ; (Msb, K;) of which the last is pl. of<br>\
جُمَعَةٌ, [as well as of جُمْعَةٌ, accord. to analogy,]<br>\
but not so جُمَعٌ (AHát) [nor either of the other<br>\
pls. mentioned above]. ―<br>\
-b3-  In like manner you<br>\
say صَلَاةٌ الجُمْعَةِ [The prayer of Friday], and,<br>\
in consequence of the frequency of usage, الجُمْعَةُ<br>\
alone. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  الجُمْعَةُ, with the م quiescent,<br>\
is also a name for [The week; i. e.] the days of<br>\
the week [collectively]; of which the Arabs are<br>\
said, by IAar, to have reckoned the Sabbath<br>\
(السَّبْت [i. e. Saturday]) as the first, though they<br>\
called Sunday the first of the days. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
جُمْعَةٌ is also syn. with مَجْمُوعَةٌ [meaning Things<br>\
collected together; or a collection of things];<br>\
(K;) as in the phrase جُمْعَةٌ مِنْ حَصًى [a collection of pebbles]. (TA.) ―<br>\

مِنْ تَمْرٍ, meaning A handful of dates. (S, K.)<br>\

جَمْعِىٌّ Of, or relating to, a plural.]<br>\
جُمَعِىٌّ One who fasts on Friday by himself.<br>\
(IAar, Th.)<br>\
جِمَاعٌ: see جَمْعٌ as signifying “ a plural,” in<br>\
three places. [The primary signification seems to<br>\
be the last there mentioned; where it is said,]<br>\
الجِمَاعُ is What comprises a number [of things]:<br>\
(S, K:) one says, الخَمْرُ جِمَاعُ الإِثْمِ (S, TA) [i. e.<br>\
Wine is what comprises a number of sins: or]<br>\
that in which sin is comprised, and known to be:<br>\
the saying is a trad.: (TA:) or جِمَاعُ الإِثْمِ signifies the plurality (جَمْع) of sins. (Msb.) Hence<br>\
also the saying of El-Hasan El-Basree, اِتَّقُوا هٰذِهِ<br>\
الأَهْوَآءَ فَإِنَّ جِمَاعَهَا الضَّلَالَةُ وَمَعَادَهَا النَّارُ [Beware ye<br>\
of these natural desires; for what they involve is<br>\
error, and the place to which they lead is the fire<br>\
of Hell]. (TA: in the L, وميعادها.) And it is<br>\
said in a trad., حَدِّثْنِى بِكَلِمَةٍ تَكُونُ جِمَاعًا i. e. Tell<br>\
me a saying comprising [virtually] a plurality of<br>\
sayings. (TA.) [See a similar phrase below,<br>\
voce جَامِعٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence also,] بُرْمَةٌ جِمَاعٌ A stonecooking-pot of the largest size: (Ks, L:) or قِدْرٌ<br>\
جِمَاعٌ, and ↓ جَامِعَةٌ, (S, K, TA,) a cooking-pot<br>\
that comprises a slaughtered camel; or, accord.<br>\
to the A, that comprises a sheep or goat: (TA:)<br>\
or a great cooking-pot; (S, K;) as also ↓ جَامِعٌ:<br>\
(Sgh, K:) pl. [most probably of this last] جُمْعٌ<br>\
[like as بُزْلٌ is pl. of بَازِلٌ, &amp;c.]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  You<br>\
say also, فُلَانٌ جِمَاعٌ لِبَنِى فُلَانٍ Such a one is an<br>\
object of resort for his counsel and authority to<br>\
the sons of such a one. (TA.)<br>\

جَمِيعٌ In a state of collection, congregation, or<br>\

also جَمْعٌ, in four places. ―<br>\
-b4-  A man compact, or<br>\
compressed, or contracted, in make, or frame:<br>\

A man having his arms, or weapons, collected<br>\

might be its issues, or results, and saying at one<br>\
time, I will do thus, and at another time, I will<br>\
do thus. (AHeyth.)<br>\
جَمَاعَةٌ: see جَمْعٌ, in two places.<br>\
جَمَّاعٌ and ↓ مِجْمَعٌ [are mentioned together, but<br>\
not explained, in the TA: the former signifies,<br>\
and probably, judging from analogy, the latter<br>\
likewise, as also ↓ جَمُوعٌ, One who collects much;<br>\
or who collects many things]. ―<br>\
-b2-  إِبِلٌ جَمَّاعَةٌ: see<br>\
جَمِيعٌ<br>\
جُمَّاعٌ Anything of which the several component<br>\
parts are collected, brought, gathered, or drawn,<br>\
together. (IDrd, K.) ―<br>\

applied to a woman, it means Short. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Hence also,] جُمَّاعٌ الثُّرَيَّا The cluster of the<br>\
Pleiades: (IDrd:) or persons who collect together<br>\
for the rain of the Pleiades, which is the rain<br>\
called الوَسْمِىّ, looking for the fruitfulness and<br>\

-b4-  And جُمَّاعُ<br>\
النَّاسِ A medley, or mixed or promiscuous multitude or collection, of men, or people, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
of various tribes; (S, K;) as also جُمَّاعٌ alone:<br>\

state of dispersion. (Ham p. 302.) ―<br>\
-b5-  جُمَّاعٌ also<br>\
signifies The place [either properly or tropically]<br>\
which comprises the origin of anything; (K, TA;)<br>\
the source of descent or extraction of people; and<br>\
hence applied by I &#39;Ab to main tribes from which<br>\
other tribes are derived; or, as some say, used by<br>\
him as meaning various classes of men, such as<br>\
are termed أَوْزَاع and أَوْشَاب. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [And The<br>\
main, or most essential, part of a thing. Thus,]<br>\
جُمَّاعُ جَسَدِ الإِنْسَانِ means The head of the man.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  جُمَّاعُ التَّمْرِ The contraction (تَجَمُّع) of<br>\

[because it collects what passes from the stomach;]<br>\
of the dial. of El-Yemen. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, (Msb,)<br>\
or المَسْجِدُ الجَامِعُ, (S, K,) [The congregational<br>\
mosque;] the mosque in which the [congregational] prayers of Friday are performed; because<br>\
it collects the people for a certain time; (Msb;)<br>\
and you may also say, مَسْجِدُ الجَامِعِ, meaning<br>\
مَسْجِدُ اليَوْمِ الجَامِعِ, (S, K,) like as you say الحَقُّ<br>\
اليَقِينُ and حَقُّ اليَقِينِ, [the latter] as meaning<br>\
حَقُّ الشَّىْءِ اليَقِينِ; for it is not allowable to prefix<br>\
a noun to another of the same meaning except<br>\
with this kind of subaudition; or, accord. to Fr,<br>\
the Arabs used to do so because of the difference<br>\
of the two words themselves: (S:) or مسجد<br>\
الجامع is a mistake: (K:) so says Lth; but all<br>\
others allow it; for the Arabs prefix a subst. to<br>\
another signifying the same thing, and also to its<br>\
epithet, as in the phrases in the Kur دِينُ القَيِّمَةِ<br>\
[ch. xcviii. v. 4] and وَعْدَ الصِّدْقِ [ch. xlvi. v. 15]:<br>\
(Az, TA:) [pl. جَوَامِعُ.] ―<br>\
-b5-  مِصْرٌ جَامِعٌ [A great<br>\
town comprising a large population; a comprehensive great town]. (Msb in art. مدن [where it<br>\
is given as the explanation of مَدِينَةٌ]; and K in<br>\
art. قرى [where it is less properly given as the<br>\
explanation of قَرْيَةٌ].) ―<br>\
-b6-  قِدْرٌ جَامِعٌ and جَامِعَةٌ:<br>\
see جِمَاعٌ ―<br>\
-b7-  اِمْرَأَةٌ جامِعٌ: see the paragraph commencing with الجُمْعُ; last signification. ―<br>\
-b8-  أَتَانٌ<br>\
جَامِعٌ A she-ass pregnant when beginning to be so.<br>\
(S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b9-  ↓ جَامِعَةٌ A [collar of the kind called]<br>\
غُلّ; (S, K;) because it collects together the two<br>\
hands to the neck: (S:) pl. جَوَامِعُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
أَمْرٌ جَامِعٌ An affair that collects people together:<br>\
or, as Er-Rághib says, a momentous affair, on<br>\
account of which people collect themselves together; as though the affair itself collected them.<br>\
(TA.) [Similar to this is the saying,] الصَّلَاةُ<br>\
جَامِعَةٌ لِكُلِّ النَّاسِ Prayer is a collector of all<br>\
people. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b11-  It is said of Mohammad,<br>\
(Msb,) كَانَ يَتَكَلَّمُ بِجَوَامِعِ الكَلِمِ He used to<br>\
speak comprehensive but concise language; language conveying many meanings in few words.<br>\
(Msb, K. [In the CK, الكلم is omitted.]) And<br>\
hence the saying of &#39;Omar Ibn-&#39;Abd-el-&#39;Azeez,<br>\
عَجِبْتُ لِمَنْ لَاحَنَ النَّاسَ كَيْفَ لَا يَعْرِفُ جَوَامِعَ الكَلِمِ,<br>\
meaning [I wonder at him who vies with men in<br>\
endeavouring to show his superiority of intelligence,] how it is that he does not [know the way<br>\
to] confine himself to conciseness, and abstain<br>\
from superfluity, of speech. (TA.) In like manner, (TA,) it is said in a trad., أُوتِيتُ جَوَامِعَ الكَلِمِ,<br>\
meaning I have had communicated to me the<br>\
Kur-án, (K, TA,) in which many meanings are<br>\
comprised in a few words. (TA.) الجَوَامِعُ مِنَ<br>\
الدُّعَآءِ, also, signifies Prayers, or supplications,<br>\
combining petitions for good and right objects of<br>\
desire with praise of God and with the general<br>\
prescribed observances proper to the case. (TA.)<br>\
You say also, المَحَامِدِ ↓ حَمِدْتُ اللّٰهَ بِمَجَامِعِ I<br>\
praised God with words comprising various<br>\
forms of praise. (Msb.) [See also جِمَاعٌ.] ―<br>\
-b12-<br>\
رَجُلٌ جَامِعٌ A man who combines such qualities<br>\
that he is suited to hardship and to easiness of<br>\
circumstances. (As. T in art. ادم.) And رَجُلٌ<br>\
جَامِعٌ لِلْخَيْرِ (T and M and K in art. ام) A man<br>\
combining all kinds of good qualities. (TK in<br>\
that art.) ―<br>\
-b13-  دَابَّةٌ جَامِعٌ A beast fit for the إِكَاف<br>\
and the سَرْج [i. e. for the saddle of either of the<br>\
kinds thus called]. (Sgh, K.) ―<br>\
-b14-  جَمَلٌ جَامِعٌ, and<br>\
نَاقَةٌ جَامِعَةٌ, (K,) accord. to ISh, (TA,) A hecamel, and a she-camel, that fails of putting forth<br>\
the tooth called ناب at the time expected; expl.<br>\
by أَخْلَفَا بُزُولًا: but this is not said except after<br>\
four years: (K:) so in the copies of the K; but<br>\
correctly, accord. to the O and TS, this is not<br>\
said after four years, [app. reckoned from the<br>\
usual time of بزول, for this is in the ninth year,<br>\
or, sometimes, in the eighth,] without the exceptive<br>\
particle. (TA.)<br>\
جَامِعَةٌ used as a subst.: see the next preceding<br>\
paragraph.<br>\
أَجْمَعُ [Collecting, comprising, or containing,<br>\
a greater, or the greatest, number or quantity;<br>\
more, or most, comprehensive. Of its usage in a<br>\
superlative sense, the following are exs.]. إِذَا أَخَذَ<br>\
شَاهِدَ زُورٍ بَعَثَ بِهِ إِلَى السُّوقِ أَجْمَعَ مَا كَانَ [When<br>\
he took a false witness, he sent him to the market<br>\
when it comprised, or contained, the greatest<br>\
number of people]: اجمع being here in the accus.<br>\
case as a denotative of state with respect to the<br>\
سوق: and the reason why كانت is not here said<br>\
[instead of كان] is that سوق is sometimes masc.<br>\
(Mgh.) And اِفْعَلْ مَا هُوَ أَجْمَعُ لِأُصُولِ الأَحْكَامِ<br>\
[Do thou that which is most comprehensive in<br>\
relation to the principles of the ordinances applying to the case]. (Msb in art. حوط.)<br>\
-A2-  [As a<br>\
simple epithet, Entire, complete, or whole: fem.<br>\
جَمْعَآءُ. You say,] بَهِيمَةٌ جَمْعَآءُ A beast free from<br>\
defects, entire in all its limbs or members, without<br>\
mutilation, and without cauterization; (TA;) a<br>\
beast from the body of which nothing has gone.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَاقَةٌ جَمْعَآءُ [may sometimes have the<br>\
like meaning: or,] accord. to IAar, (TA,) A she-camel extremely aged, (K, TA,) so that her<br>\
teeth have become short, and almost gone. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  It is also a sing. having the meaning of a<br>\
pl., (S, K,) without any proper sing. of its own:<br>\
(S:) its pl. is أَجْمَعُونَ: and its fem. is جَمْعَآءُ:<br>\
(S, K:) and the pl. of this last is جُمَعُ, though<br>\
by rule it should be formed by the addition of ا<br>\
and ت to the sing., like as the pl. of أَجْمَعُ is<br>\
formed by the addition of و and ن; (S;) the<br>\
original form from which جُمَعُ is changed being<br>\
جَمْعَاوَاتٌ; or it is جَمَاعَى; it is not جُمْعٌ, because<br>\
أَجْمَعُ is not an epithet, like as أَحْمَرُ is, of which<br>\
the pl. is حُمْرٌ; (L;) for it is determinate, though<br>\
of the measure of an epithet, which is indeterminate; (AAF;) and though it is in concordance<br>\
with the noun which precedes it, like an epithet,<br>\
it is shown to be not an epithet by its not having<br>\
a broken pl.: (L:) it is a simple corroborative;<br>\
(S, K;) and so are أَجْمَعُونَ and جَمْعَآءُ and جُمَعُ;<br>\
not used as an inchoative nor as an enunciative<br>\
nor as the agent of a verb nor as the objective<br>\
complement of a verb, like as are some other<br>\
corroboratives, such as نَفْسُهُ and عَيْنُهُ and كُلُّهُ.<br>\
(S.) You say, أَخَذْتُ حَقِّى أَجْمَعَ [I took my<br>\
right, or due, all of it, or altogether]: and رأَيْتُ<br>\
النِّسْوَةَ جُمَعَ [I saw the women, all of them, or all<br>\
together]: the last word in this and similar cases<br>\
being imperfectly declinable, and determinate<br>\
word: (Sudot;, TA:) and جَاؤُوا أَجْمَعُونَ [They came,<br>\
all of them, or all together]: and رَأَيْتُهُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ<br>\
[I saw them, all of them, or all together]: and<br>\
مَرَرْتُ بِهِمْ أَجْمَعِينَ [I passed by them, all of them,<br>\
or all together]. (Msb.) Fr mentions the phrases,<br>\
أَعْجَبَنِى القَصْرُ أَجْمَعَ [The palace pleased me, all<br>\
of it, or altogether], and الدَّارُ جَمْعَآءَ [The house,<br>\
all of it, or altogether], with the accus. case, as<br>\
denotative of state; but does not allow أَجْمَعُونَ<br>\
nor جُمَعُ to be used otherwise than as corroboratives: IDrst, however, allows أَجْمَعِينَ to be used<br>\
as a denotative of state; and this is correct; and<br>\
accord. to both these ways is related the trad.,<br>\
فَصَلُّوا جُلُوسًا أَجْمَعِينَ and أَجْمَعُونَ [And pray ye<br>\
sitting, all of you, or all together]; though some<br>\
make اجمعين [here] to be a corroborative of a<br>\
pronoun understood in the accus. case, as though<br>\
the speaker said, أَعْنِيكُمْ أَجْمَعِينَ [I mean you,<br>\
all of you, or all together]: (K in art. بتع:) or<br>\
اجمعين in this case is a corruption committed by<br>\
the relaters in the first age; and he is in error<br>\
who says that it is in the accus. case as a denotative of state, for corroboratives are determinate,<br>\
and the denotative of state is literally or virtually indeterminate. (Msb.) [Respecting the<br>\
usage of this corroborative together with others<br>\
similar to it, see أَبْتَعُ.] You say also, جَاؤُوا<br>\
بِأَجْمَعِهِمْ, and بِأَجْمُعِهِمْ, with damm to the م,<br>\
[They came, all of them, or all together,] (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) the latter mentioned by ISk. (Msb.)<br>\
And you say, قَبَضْتُ المَالَ أَجْمَعَهُ [I took, or<br>\
received, the property, all of it, or altogether].<br>\
(Msb.) And ↓ جَمِيعٌ, also, is used as a corroborative: (S, Msb:) as in the saying جَاؤُوا جَمِيعًا,<br>\
meaning They came, all of them: (S:) and<br>\
قَبَضْتُ المَالَ جَمِيعَهُ, like أَجْمَعَهُ [explained above]:<br>\
(Msb:) and جَمِيعَةً occurs as its fem.; but this<br>\
is extr. (TA.)<br>\
