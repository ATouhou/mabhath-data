ج<br>\
The fifth letter of the alphabet: called جِيمٌ,<br>\
which is one of the names of letters of the fem.<br>\
gender, but which it is allowable to make masc.:<br>\
it is one of the letters termed مَجْهُورَة [or vocal,<br>\
i. e. pronounced with the voice, and not with the<br>\
breath only]: and of the number of the letters<br>\
termed مَحْقُورَة, and حُرُوفُ القَلْقَلَةِ, because it<br>\
cannot be uttered in a case of pause without a<br>\
strong compression, and a strong sound: and it<br>\
is also one of those termed شَجْرِيَّة, from الشَّجْرُ,<br>\
which is the place of opening of the mouth.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is sometimes substituted for ى, when<br>\
the latter letter is doubled, (K,) or is so substituted by some of the Arabs; (AA, S;) as in<br>\
فُقَيْمِجٌّ, for فُقَيْمِىٌّ; (AA, S, K;) and مُرِّجٌّ, for<br>\
مُرِّىٌّ. (AA, S.) An Arab of the desert recited<br>\
to Khalaf El-Ahmar,<br>\
الْمُطْعِمَانِ الَّحْمَ بِالْعَشِجِّ خَالِى عُوَيْفٌ وَأَبُو عَلِجِّ<br>\
[My maternal uncle is &#39;Oweyf, and Aboo-&#39;Alijj,<br>\
who feed with flesh-meat at nightfall]; meaning<br>\
عَلِىّ and عَشِىّ. (S.) It is also sometimes substituted for a single ى. (S, K.) AZ gives the<br>\
following ex.:<br>\
يَا رَبِّ إِنْ كُنْتَ قَبِلْتَ حُجَّتِجْ<br>\
فَلَا يَزَالُ شَاحِجٌ يَأْتِيكَ بِجْ<br>\
[O my Lord, if Thou accept my plea, a brayer<br>\
(or mule) shall not cease to bring me to Thee (i. e.<br>\
to thy temple)]; (S;) meaning حُجَّتِى (K) [and<br>\
بِى]. أَمْسَجَتْ and أَمْسَجَا are also mentioned as<br>\
occurring in a verse, for أَمْسَتْ and أَمْسَى [because<br>\
originally أَمْسَيَتْ and أَمْسَىَ]. (S.) But all these<br>\
substitutions are abominable, (S, Ibn-&#39;Osfoor,) and<br>\
only allowable in cases of poetical necessity. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Osfoor.) It is further said that some of the Arabs,<br>\
among whom were the tribe of Kudá&#39;ah, changed<br>\
ى, when occurring immediately after ع, into ج;<br>\
and said, for رَاعٍ, [originally رَاعِىٌ,] رَاعِجٌ: this<br>\
is what is termed عَجْعَجَةٌ: Fr attributes the<br>\
substitution of ج for ى to the tribe of Teiyi, and<br>\
some of the tribe of Asad. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Some of<br>\
the Arabs also changed it into ى; saying شَيَرَةٌ<br>\
for شَجَرَةٌ, and جَثْيَاثٌ for جَثْجَاثٌ, and يَصَّصَ<br>\
for جَصَّصَ. (AZ, S in art. يص.)<br>\
-A2-  [As a numeral, ج denotes Three; and, as such, is generally<br>\
written without the dot, but thus ح, or thus ح,<br>\
to distinguish it from ح, which denotes eight.]<br>\
