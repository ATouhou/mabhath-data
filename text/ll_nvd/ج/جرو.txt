أَجْرَتْ [in its primary sense app. signifies<br>\
She (a bitch, and any female beast of prey,)<br>\
whelped; or had a whelp, or whelps: see مُجْرٍ.<br>\
(Accord. to Golius, as on the authority of J,<br>\
Cum fœtu abiit vel asportavit eum fera: but I<br>\
have not found it in any copy of the S, nor in<br>\
any other lexicon.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence,] said of a tree<br>\
(شَجَرَةٌ), It had upon it [fruits such as are<br>\
termed] جِرَآء [pl. of جِرْوٌ]; (As, TA;) said [for<br>\
instance] of a مَوْزَة [or banana-tree]: (AHn, TA<br>\
in art. موز:) and [in like manner] said of a herb,<br>\
or leguminous plant, (بَقْلَةٌ,) it had جِرَآء; (K in<br>\
art. جرى; [in the CK, erroneously, جَراء;]) belonging to the present art., not to art. جرى.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
جِرْوٌ and جُرْوٌ and جَرْوٌ (of which the first is<br>\
the most chaste, Msb) The whelp, or young one,<br>\
of the dog, (S, Msb, K,) [and so, app., ↓ جِرْوَةٌ,<br>\
q. v.,] and of the lion, (K,) and of any beast of<br>\
prey: (S, Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَجْرٍ, (S, K,)<br>\
originally أَجْرُوٌ, (S,) and أَجْرِيَةٌ (Lh, K) and<br>\
أَجْرَآءٌ (K) and [of mult.] جِرَآءٌ; (S, K;) أَجْرِيَةٌ, as<br>\
pl. of جرو, being anomalous; (TA;) or it is pl.<br>\
of جِرَآءٌ [and therefore not anomalous]. (S, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And the same, (K,) or the first of these, (S,<br>\
El-Bári&#39;, Msb, TA,) only, (TA,) (tropical:)  The small of<br>\
anything, (El-Bári&#39;, Msb, K, TA,) as also ↓ جِرْوَةٌ;<br>\

and of the melon, and the like; (K;) as, for<br>\
instance, (TA,) of the pomegranate, (S, TA,) and<br>\
of the poppy, (AHn, TA in art. عتر,) and of the<br>\
بَاذَنْجَان, (TA,) and of the cucumber, (S, TA,)<br>\
as also ↓ جِرْوَةٌ, (S, Msb,) likened to the whelps of<br>\
dogs, because of their softness and smoothness:<br>\
(Msb:) or what is round of the fruits of trees;<br>\
as the colocynth and the like: (TA:) pl. [of<br>\
pauc.] أجْرٍ (Msb, K, TA [in the CK, erroneously,<br>\
اَجْرُؤٌ]) and [of mult.] جِرَآءٌ. (As, Msb, K.) ―<br>\

its fresh, juicy, state. (AHn, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  The seeds,<br>\
(M, TA,) or envelope, or receptacle, of the seeds,<br>\

that are at the heads of branches. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
(tropical:)  A tumour in a camel&#39;s hump; and in the<br>\
withers; so called by way of comparison [to a<br>\
whelp]: (TA:) and in the fauces. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See<br>\
also what next follows, last sentence.<br>\
جِرْوَةٌ: see جِرْوٌ, in three places. A huntsman<br>\
beat, or disciplined, or trained, his dog for the<br>\
purpose of the chase (ضَرَبَهُ عَلَى الصَّيْدِ); and<br>\
thereupon it was said, ضَرَبَ جِرْوَتَهُ [app. meaning<br>\
He beat, or disciplined, or trained, his whelp]:<br>\
and hence this phrase became proverbially used,<br>\
in instances here following. (Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  I. q.<br>\
نَفْسٌ [as meaning Self]. (TA.) You say, ضَرَبَ<br>\
عَلَيْهِ جِرْوَتَهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He disposed and subjected<br>\
himself to it; (S, TA;) namely, a thing, an<br>\
affair, or a case: and he endured it with patience:<br>\
and in like manner, ضَرَبَ جِرْوَةَ نَفْسِهِ: (TA:)<br>\
and أَلْقَى فُلَانٌ جرْوَتَهُ he endured the thing with<br>\
patience. (S, TA.) Also ضَرَبْتُ جِرْوَتِى عَنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  I<br>\
endured with patience the want, or loss, of it:<br>\
(TA:) or my mind became at ease [respecting it].<br>\
(AA, IB, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also (K, TA, [in the CK<br>\
↓ جِرْوٌ,]) (tropical:)  A short she-camel. (K, TA.)<br>\
مُجْرٍ and مُجْرِيَةٌ applied to a bitch, (S, K,) and<br>\
a female beast of prey, (TA,) Having a whelp,<br>\
or young one: (K:) or having with her her<br>\
whelps, or young ones. (S.) El-Aalam says,<br>\
لَحْمِى إِلَى أَجْرٍ حَوَاشِبْ  وَتَجُرُّ مُجْرِيَةٌ لَهَا<br>\
And a hyena having young ones shall drag for<br>\
her my flesh to young ones with swollen bellies,<br>\
and short. (Skr p. 57.)<br>\
