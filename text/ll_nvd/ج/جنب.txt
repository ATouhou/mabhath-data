(K:) or the part of a man that is beneath the<br>\
arm-pit, extending to the flank; as also ↓ جَانِبٌ,<br>\
because it is the side of the person: (Msb:) pl.<br>\
(of the first, Msb) جُنُوبٌ (Msb, K) and [of the<br>\
same, a pl. of pauc.,] أَجْنَابٌ (CK) and [of جَانِبٌ]<br>\
جَوَانِبُ (Lh, ISd, K, but not in the CK) and<br>\
[app. of جَنْبٌ (like as لَيَائِلُ is a pl. of لَيْلٌ) or of<br>\
جَنَبَةٌ (like as حَوَائِجُ is pl. of حَاجَةٌ which is originally حَوَجَةٌ) or of both these] ↓ جَنائِبُ (M, K,)<br>\
which is extr. (M, TA.) [Hence,] قَعَدْتُ إِلَى<br>\
جَنْبِ فُلَانٍ and فلان ↓ الى جَانِبِ [I sat by the<br>\
side of such a one]: both meaning the same. (S.)<br>\
And ↓ إِنَّهُ لَمُنْتَفِخُ الجَوَانِبِ [Verily he is inflated<br>\
in the side]: جوانب being here one of those<br>\
words which are used in the sing. sense though<br>\
in the pl. form. (Lh, TA.) And أَعْطَاهُ الجَنْبَ<br>\
[lit. He gave him the side; meaning] he was, or<br>\
became, submissive, manageable, easy, or tractable, to him. (A.) And جَارُ الجَنْبِ He who<br>\
cleaves to one, keeping by one&#39;s side. (K. [Differing from جَارُ الجُنُبِ, q. v. infrà.]) And الصَّاحِبُ<br>\
بِالجَنْبِ [in the Kur iv. 40] The travelling-companion; the companion in a journey: (S, K:)<br>\
or he who is near one; or by one&#39;s side: or the<br>\
companion in every good affair: or the husband:<br>\
or the wife. (TA.) And ذَاتُ الجَنْبِ, (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) with which ↓ الجُنَابُ is syn.,<br>\
(K,) [and sometimes الجَنْبُ, as will be seen in<br>\
what follows,] A well-known disease; (Mgh;)<br>\
[the pleurisy; called by the first of these three<br>\
appellations in the present day;] a severe disease,<br>\
being an inflammatory tumour in the [pleura, or]<br>\
membrane within the ribs: (Msb:) or an ulcer,<br>\
or a purulent pustule, that comes within a man&#39;s<br>\
side: (S, TA:) it is a severe disease in the side:<br>\
accord. to El-Hejeree, it is in either side; and<br>\
they assert that when it is in the left side, the<br>\
patient perishes: accord. to ISh, the دُبَيْلَة; which<br>\
is an ulcer that penetrates into the belly: or the<br>\
ulcer (دُبَيْلَة and دُمَّل) that comes forth within<br>\
the side, and discharges internally; the sufferer<br>\
from which seldom recovers: he who suffers from<br>\
it [and dies in consequence], or, as some say, he<br>\
who is afflicted by a complaint of the side (absolutely) while warring in the cause of God, is<br>\
reckoned a martyr: (TA:) [soldiers in a campaign are notoriously more subject to it than persons<br>\
in most other circumstances; and it is app. for<br>\
this reason that] it is termed دَآءُ الصَّنَادِيدِ [the<br>\
disease of the courageous chiefs]. (A, TA.) ذُو<br>\
الجَنْبِ, of which ذَاتُ الجُنْبِ is the fem., signifies<br>\
Having a complaint of his side by reason of [the<br>\
disease above mentioned, or what is termed] الدُّبَيْلَة.<br>\

(Akh, S, TA:) as though he reckoned the latter<br>\
equal to all the people. (TA. [This is cited in<br>\
the S and TA as though it were an ex. of جنب<br>\

be rather an ex. of this word in the sense first<br>\

-b3-  I. q.<br>\
نَاحِيَةٌ [A side; meaning a lateral, or an outward<br>\
or adjacent, part or portion, region, quarter, or<br>\
tract; or a part, region, quarter, or tract, considered with respect to its collocation or juxtaposition or direction, or considered as belonging<br>\
to a whole; a vicinage, or neighbourhood]; (S,<br>\

and ↓ جَنْبَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ جَنَبَةٌ (S) and ↓ جَنَابَةٌ.<br>\
(L, TA.) It is said that the primary signification<br>\
of جَنْبٌ is the part of the body mentioned in the<br>\
beginning of this paragraph, and that its use in the<br>\
sense of نَاحيَةٌ is metaphorical, as is the case of<br>\
يَمِينٌ and شِمَالٌ; but نَاحِيَةٌ is mentioned in the<br>\
Msb as the primary signification of ↓ جَانِبٌ;<br>\
(MF, TA;) though its primary signification accord. to the K and ISd seems to be that first<br>\
mentioned. (TA.) You say, ↓ مَشَوْا جَانِبَيْهِ and<br>\
↓ جَنَابَيْهِ and ↓ جَنْبَتَيْهِ and ↓ جَنَابَتَيْهِ [They walked,<br>\
or went on foot, on either side of him]. (A, TA. *)<br>\
And ↓ مَرُّوا يَسِيرُونَ جَنَابَيْهِ (S, L) and ↓ جَنْبَتَيْهِ<br>\
and ↓ جَنَابَتَيْهِ (L, TA) They went along journeying on either side of him. (S, L.) And كُنَّا عَنْهُمْ<br>\
↓ جَنَا بَيْنِ and ↓ جَنَابًا We were apart from them<br>\
[on two sides and on one side]. (TA.) And نَزَلُوا<br>\
الوَادِى ↓ فِى جَنَابَاتِ [They alighted in the sides of<br>\
the valley, or in the tracts beside the valley]. (A.)<br>\
And ↓ فُلَانٌ لَا يَطُورُ بِجَنَبَتِنَا Such a one will not<br>\
approach our quarter: (S:) thus accord. to AO;<br>\
with fet-h to the ن: IJ, however, says, people<br>\
are wont to say, ↓ أَنَا فِى ذَرَاكَ وَجَنَبَتِكَ [meaning<br>\
I am under thy protection and in thy quarter];<br>\
but that the correct expression is ↓ جَنْبَتِكَ, with<br>\
the ن quiescent. (IB, TA.) The Arabs also<br>\
said, سُهَيْلٍ ↓ الحَرُّ جَانِبَىْ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  The heat is<br>\
on either side of Suheyl [or Canopus: i. e., during<br>\
the period next before, and that next after, the<br>\
auroral rising of Canopus; which rising began,<br>\
in central Arabia, at the commencement of the<br>\
era of the Flight, about the 4th of August,<br>\
O. S.]: this is the greatest heat. (TA.) One<br>\
also says, ↓ أَحَاطُوا بِهِ مِنْ جَانِبَيْهِ [meaning They<br>\
surrounded him on all his sides; lit., on his two<br>\
sides]; dividing the surrounding parts into two,<br>\
but not meaning that any of these remained<br>\
vacant. (Expos. of the exs. cited as testimonies<br>\
by Sb, TA in art. حول.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, [and ↓ جَانِبٌ,<br>\
which is thus used in the L in art. جنح, and by<br>\
many authors,] A part, or portion, of a thing;<br>\
(L;) the greater, or main, or chief, part or<br>\
portion thereof; most thereof; (L, K;) or a great<br>\
part or portion thereof; much thereof. (L.)<br>\
Hence, [or perhaps from جَنْبٌ in the second of<br>\
the senses assigned to it above, conveying the<br>\
idea of juxtaposition, and thus of comparison,]<br>\
هٰذَا قَلِيلٌ جَنْبِ مَوَدَّتِكَ [This is little in comparison with the magnitude of thy love; or<br>\
simply, in comparison with thy love]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
يَا حَسْرَتَا عَلَى مَا فَرَّطْتُ فِى جنْبِ اللّٰهِ [in the Kur<br>\
xxxix. 57] means ↓ فى جَانِبِه, i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [O my grief,<br>\

respect of that which is the right, or due, of<br>\
God! (A, Bd, TA,) i. e., (Bd,) in respect of<br>\
obedience to God! (Bd, Jel:) or, in respect of<br>\
[the means of attaining] nearness to God! (Fr,<br>\
TA;) or, nearness to God in Paradise! (IAar,<br>\
TA:) or, in respect of the way of God, to which<br>\
He hath called me! i. e., the profession of his<br>\

of Mohammad. (Zj, TA.) The saying of the<br>\
Arabs, اِتَّقِ اللّٰهَ فِى جَنْبِهِ وَلَا تَقْدَحْ فِى سَاقِهِ [may<br>\
be rendered (assumed tropical:)  Fear God in respect of his (thy<br>\

honour, or reputation: or] means, accord. to the<br>\
copies of the K, لَا تَقْتُلْهُ [slay him not], or, as in<br>\
the L, and in the original draught of the author<br>\
[of the K] لا تَغْتَلْهُ [slay him not clandestinely,<br>\
or on an occasion of inadvertence], from الغِيلَةُ,<br>\
and throw him not into trouble, or trial: (TA:)<br>\
or, accord. to some, فى جنبه means in detracting<br>\

[See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 240.]) A poet,<br>\
cited by IAar, says,<br>\
