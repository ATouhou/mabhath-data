(a thing, S, or a commodity, an article of household-goods, or the like, Msb, and a work, or performance, TA) was, or became, جَيِّد [i. e. good,<br>\
goodly, approvable, or excellent; the verb being<br>\
the contr. of رَدُؤَ, as is implied in the A and K]:<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K:) in this sense, accord. to some,<br>\
of the class of قَالَ; accord. to others, of the class<br>\

he gave what was meet to him to whom it was<br>\
meet: (El-Karmánee, TA:) or he gave what was<br>\
meet to him to whom it was meet, not for a compensation; so that it has a more special signification than أَحْسَنَ. (MF.) You say, جاد بِمَالِهِ<br>\
[He was liberal, &amp;c., with his property]: (S:)<br>\
or جاد بِالمَالِ he affected, or constrained himself,<br>\
to be generous with the property. (Msb.) ―<br>\

irrigates everything: (M:) or rain that is not<br>\

observe that the phrase, mentioned by Sb, أَخَذْتَنَا<br>\
بِالجَوْدِوَفَوْقهَا [Thou hast assailed us with a storm<br>\
of reproach or the like not to be exceeded, and<br>\
with that which is above it,] is one of hyperbole<br>\
and reproach. (M, L.) It is an inf. n. thus used<br>\
as an epithet [and therefore applicable without<br>\
variation to a fem. as to a masc. n., and to a dual<br>\
and a pl. as to a sing. n.]: (L:) and is also pl.<br>\
[or rather a quasi-pl. n.] of جَائِدٌ, (S, L, K,) like<br>\
as صَحْبٌ is of صَاحِبٌ. (S, L.) You say مَطَرٌ جَوْدٌ<br>\

لَنَا سَمَآءٌ جَوْدٌ [A copious, or an abundant, rain,<br>\
&amp;c., became stirred up for us]: (S, K: *) and<br>\
you also say, [contr. to the usage mentioned<br>\
above, or as though جَوْدٌ were an epithet from<br>\
جَادَ, and this originally جَوْدَ, like ضَخْمٌ from<br>\
ضَخُمَ, but used as a subst.,] مَطْرَتَانِ جَوْدَانِ<br>\
[Two showers of rain, copious, or abundant, &amp;c.].<br>\
(S, K.) ↓ تَجَاوِيدُ, [app. signifying the same as<br>\
جَوْدٌ used as a pl.,] occurring in the following<br>\
verse of Sakhr El-Ghei,<br>\
يُلَاعِبُ الرِّيحَ بِالعَصْرَيْنِ قَصْطَلُهُ<br>\
وَالوَابِلُونَ وَتَهْتَانُ التَّجَاوِيدِ<br>\
[Its dust makes sport with the wind in the morning and evening, or night and day, and so do<br>\
the violent showers of big drops, and the pouring<br>\
of copious, or abundant, rains, &amp;c.], (L, K, *) is<br>\
a pl. having no sing.; (K;) or it may be so,<br>\
like تَعَاجِيبُ and تَعَاشِيبُ and تَبَاشِيرُ; or it may<br>\
be pl. of تَجْوَادٌ [an inf. n.]. (L.) You say also,<br>\
امَطَرِ ↓ أَصَابَتْهُ تَجَاوِيدُ [Copious showers of rain<br>\
fell upon him, or it]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also جَوَادٌ.<br>\
جَوْدَةٌ [an inf. n. of 1, (q. v.,) in two senses; as<br>\
also جُودَةٌ: and an inf. n. of un., signifying] A<br>\
single affection of thirst; a thirsting. (S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also جُوَادٌ.<br>\
جَادِىٌّ Saffron. (S, K.)<br>\
جَوَادٌ, used alike as masc. and fem., (S, K,)<br>\
Liberal, bountiful, munificent, or generous: (S, *<br>\
K:) or one who affects, or constrains himself, to<br>\
be generous: (Msb:) or who gives without being<br>\
asked, to preserve the receiver from the ignominy<br>\
of asking: (MF:) or who gives what is meet to<br>\
him to whom it is meet: (El-Karmánee, TA:) or<br>\
who gives what is meet to him to whom it is meet,<br>\
not for a compensation; so that it has a more<br>\
special signification than مُحْسِنٌ: (MF:) pl. [of<br>\
pauc., masc.,] أَجْوَادٌ and (of mult., TA) جُوْدٌ,<br>\
(S, A, K,) like as قُذُلٌ is pl. of قَذَالٌ, but the و<br>\
is made quiescent because it is an unsound letter,<br>\
(S,) [in some copies of the K جُوُدٌ,] and أَجَاوِدُ,<br>\
(S, K,) contr. to analogy, (TA,) or أَجَاوِيدُ,<br>\
[reg., as pl. of أَجْوَادٌ,] (A,) and جُوَدَآءُ (S, K)<br>\
and جُوَدَةٌ, (CK, [in some copies of the K omitted,])<br>\
or جُوْدَةٌ, or جُوُدَةٌ, [written in the latter manner<br>\
in a MS. copy of the K,] with ة added to the<br>\
[proper] pl. form [جُوْدٌ or جُوُدٌ], accord. to the<br>\
doctrine of Sb: (TA:) جُوْدٌ is used as a fem. pl.,<br>\
(S, Msb,) and is like نُوْرٌ pl. of نَوَارٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
applied alike to the male and the female, (S,) A<br>\
courser; a fleet, or swift, and excellent, horse;<br>\
(L;) a horse fleet, or swift, in running; or excellent in running, or in the motion of his legs;<br>\
as also ↓ جَوْدٌ: (Bd in xxxviii. 30:) or that outstrips others: (Jel ib.:) i. q. رَائِعٌ: (S, L, K:)<br>\
pl. جِيَادٌ, (S, A, Bd, L, Msb, K,) which by rule<br>\
should be جِوَادٌ, like طِوَالٌ, but this latter form<br>\
has not been heard from the Arabs; (L;) or<br>\
جِيَادٌ is pl. of جَوْدٌ, or of جَيِّدٌ; (Bd ubi suprá;)<br>\
and جَوَادٌ has also for its pl. أَجْيَادٌ, [a pl. of pauc.,<br>\
and irregular, or this is pl. of جَيّدٌ, and therefore,<br>\
though irregularly, retains the ى substituted for<br>\
و] (S, L,) and أَجْوَادٌ, [also a pl. of pauc., but<br>\
agreeable with rule, or this is pl. of جَوْدٌ,] (L,)<br>\
and أَجَاوِيدُ (S, L) is pl. of أَجْوَادٌ. (L.) Hence,<br>\
أَقْبَلَ جَوَادًا (assumed tropical:)  He came on, or advanced, like a horse<br>\
that is termed جواد: and سِرْتُ إِلَيْهِ جَوَادًا (assumed tropical:)  I went<br>\
to him, or it, like a horse that is so termed.<br>\
(Mgh in art. غذ.) You say also, عَدَا عَدْوًا جَوَادًا<br>\
He ran a long run. (A, TA.) And سِرْنَا عُقْبَةً<br>\
جَوَادًا, and عُقْبَتَيْنِ جَوَادَيْنِ, and عُقَبًا جِيَادًا (S, A)<br>\
and أَجْوَادًا, (A, TA,) We journeyed a long march<br>\
or stage, and two long marches or stages, and long<br>\
marches or stages. (S, A, TA.)<br>\
جُوَادٌ [accord. to the TA inf. n. of جِيدَ, which<br>\
see in two places,] (assumed tropical:)  Thirst: (S, K:) or vehemence<br>\
of thirst. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, [accord. to the K ↓ جَوْدَةٌ,<br>\
but this is corrected in the TA,] (assumed tropical:)  Drowsiness, or<br>\
slumber. (TA.)<br>\
جَائِدٌ: see جَوْدٌ.<br>\
جَيِّدٌ, originally of the measure فَيْعِلٌ, (S, Msb,)<br>\
as the Basrees say, i. e. جَيْوِدٌ, (Msb, TA,) the و<br>\
being changed into ى because of its being meksoor<br>\
and preceded by ى, and the augmentative ى<br>\
being then incorporated into it; (TA;) or, as the<br>\
Koofees say, of the measure فَيْعَلٌ, like عَيْطَلٌ &amp;c.,<br>\
because there is found no sound word of the<br>\
measure فَيْعِلٌ except صَيْقِلٌ, a woman&#39;s name, and<br>\
the unsound is accorded to the sound; or, as<br>\
others say, of the measure فَعِيلٌ, [and so I find in<br>\
one copy of the S,] originally جَوِيدٌ, the kesreh<br>\
of the و being, accord. to them, suppressed because<br>\
difficult of pronunciation, and the quiescent و and<br>\
ى thus coming together, [the latter receives the<br>\
rejected kesreh, and] the و is changed into ى and<br>\
incorporated into the [augmentative] ى; (Msb;)<br>\
Good, goodly, approvable, or excellent; contr. of<br>\

quality; sometimes, though very rarely, in a<br>\
quality that is disapproved.]<br>\
