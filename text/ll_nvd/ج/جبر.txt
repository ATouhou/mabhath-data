جَبَرَ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
جَبُرَ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
جَبْرٌ (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and جُبُورٌ, (M, K,)<br>\
which latter, accord. to MF, is an inf. n. of the<br>\
intrans. verb only, but it has been heard as an<br>\
inf. n. of the trans. verb also, (TA,) and جِبَارَةٌ,<br>\
(Lh, K,) He set a bone; reduced it from a<br>\
fractured state; (S, A, Msb, K, &amp;c.;) as also<br>\
↓ جبّر, (A, IAmb, K,) inf. n. تَجْبِيرٌ; (TA;) and<br>\
↓ اجبر, (Ibn-Talhah, MF, TA,) but this is extremely strange, and not found in the lexicons of<br>\
celebrity, (MF,) and not heard by AO; (TA;)<br>\
[and ↓ اجتبر.] One says also, يَدَهُ ↓ جبّر, (A,<br>\
IAmb,) or جَبَرَهَا, (Msb,) He (a bone-setter) set<br>\
his arm, or reduced it from a fractured state:<br>\
(A:) or put upon it the جَبِيرَة [or splints]. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) جَبَرَ, (AAF, M, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n.<br>\
جَبْرٌ (S, A, K) and جُبُورٌ [but respecting this<br>\
latter see above] and جِبَارَةٌ; (K;) and ↓ جبّر,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. تَجْبِيرٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اجبر; (Ibn-<br>\
Talhah, MF, TA; [but respecting this form see<br>\
above;]) and ↓ اجتبر; (K;) (tropical:)  He restored a<br>\
man from a state of poverty to wealth, or competence, or sufficiency: (AAF, S, A, K, &amp;c.:) or<br>\
he benefited a poor man; conferred a benefit, or<br>\
benefits, upon him: (M, K:) but the former is<br>\
the more appropriate explanation: (AAF, TA:)<br>\
and this signification is tropical; (IDrst, MF,<br>\
TA;) the poor man being likened to one who has<br>\
a broken bone, and his restoration to wealth, or<br>\
competence, being likened to the setting of the<br>\
bone; wherefore he is called فَقِيرٌ, as though the<br>\
vertebræ of his back were broken: (IDrst, TA:)<br>\
in the A it is mentioned as proper, not tropical;<br>\
but the author of the A afterwards mentions<br>\
جَبَرْتُ فُلَانًا as tropical in the sense of نَعَشْتُهُ (tropical:)  [I<br>\
recovered such a one from his embarrassment,<br>\
&amp;c.; repaired his broken fortune, or his condition]. (TA.) One says also, جَبَرْتُ فَاقَةَ الرَّجُلِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [I repaired the broken fortune of the man;] I<br>\
restored the man to wealth, or competence, or<br>\
sufficiency. (A Heyth, TA.) And جَبَرْتُ اليَتِيمَ (assumed tropical:)  [I<br>\
put the affairs of the orphan into a right, or<br>\
good, state: or] I gave to the orphan. (Msb.)<br>\
And جَبَرَ (tropical:)  He restored anything to a sound,<br>\
right, or good, state. (IDrst, TA.) And جَبَرَهُ اللّٰهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [May God render him sound, and strong]:<br>\
said in relation to a child. (S and K in art. زرع.)<br>\
And جَبَرْتُ نِصَابَ الزَّكَاةِ بِكَذَا (assumed tropical:)  I made the<br>\
amount of the property equal to that which<br>\
renders it incumbent on the possessor to pay the<br>\
poor-rate, by [adding] such a thing: the name<br>\
of that thing is جبران [app. ↓ جُبْرَانٌ]: and the<br>\
person who does this is termed ↓ جَابِرٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  جَبَرَ also signifies He compelled, or constrained,<br>\
another. (B.) You say, جَبَرَهُ عَلَى الأَمْرِ, (Lh,<br>\
Az, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
جَبُرَ, inf. n. جَبْرٌ and جُبُورٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
a chaste form of the verb, of the dial. of El-<br>\
Hijáz, (Az, TA,) or of the Benoo-Temeem and of<br>\
many of the people of El-Hijáz, (Msb,) or of<br>\
Temeem alone; (Lh, TA;) [but said in the Mgh<br>\
to be of weak authority;] and ↓ اجبرهُ; (Th, S,<br>\
Msb, K, &amp;c.;) both these forms of the verb mentioned by AZ, Fr, A &#39;Obeyd, and others, (Msb,)<br>\
but the latter is the form used by the generality of<br>\
the Arabs, (Lh, TA,) and by the grammarians [in<br>\
general]; (TA;) He compelled him, against his<br>\
will, to do the thing: (Lh, Th, Az, S, Msb, K:) ↓ إِجْبَارٌ<br>\
originally signifying the inciting, urging, or inducing, another to restore a thing to a sound,<br>\
right, or good, state. (B.) And عَلَى الحُكْمِ ↓ اجبرهُ<br>\
He (a judge) compelled him to submit to, or to<br>\
perform, the sentence. (L.)<br>\
-A3-  Also جَبَرَ, [aor.<br>\
جَبُرَ,]<br>\
inf. n. جُبُورٌ (S, Msb, K) and جَبْرٌ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
which latter, accord. to MF [and the Mgh], is<br>\
an inf. n. of the trans. verb only, but it has been<br>\
heard as an inf. n. of the intrans. verb also;<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ انجبر, (T, S, K,) and ↓ اجتبر, (T,<br>\
S,) and ↓ تجبّر; (K;) It (a bone) became set,<br>\
or reduced from a fractured state. (T, S, Msb,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,] the first of these verbs,<br>\
with the same inf. ns.; (K;) and ↓ اجتبر, (S, *<br>\
K,) and ↓ انجبر, and ↓ تجبّر, and ↓ استجبر; (K;)<br>\
(tropical:)  He (a poor man, K, and an orphan, TA) became<br>\
restored from a state of poverty to wealth, or<br>\
competence, or sufficiency: (S, * K:) or received<br>\
a benefit, or benefits: (K:) ↓ اجتبر is syn. with<br>\
انتعش (tropical:)  [he recovered, or became recovered, from<br>\
his embarrassment, &amp;c.]. (A.) [And (assumed tropical:)  It (anything) became restored to a sound, right, or good,<br>\
state.] El-&#39; Ajjáj has used جَبَرَ transitively and intransitively in the same sentence, saying,<br>\
قَدْ جَبَرَ الدِّينَ الإِلَاهُ فَجَبَرْ<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  God hath restored the religion to a sound,<br>\
right, or good, state, and it hath become restored<br>\
thereto]: (S:) or, accord. to some, the second<br>\
verb is corroborative of the first; the meaning<br>\
being, God hath desired, or purposed, to restore<br>\
the religion, &amp;c., and hath completed its restoration. (B.)<br>\

جَبَّرَ see 1, in three places.<br>\

أَجْبَرَ see 1, in five places.<br>\
-A2-  اجبرهُ also signifies<br>\
He imputed to him [the tenet of] الجَبْر; (S, * L,<br>\
K; *) he called him a جَبَرِىّ: (L:) like as اكفرهُ<br>\
signifies “ he imputed to him infidelity. ” (S.)<br>\
5<br>\
تجبّر: see 1, latter part, in two places. Also<br>\
(tropical:)  What had gone from him (a man) returned to<br>\
him: (K:) or some of his property that had<br>\
gone from him returned to him. (T, TA.) (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
(a sick man) became in a good state. (K.) (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
(a plant, TA, and a tree, K) became green, and<br>\
put forth leaves (K, TA) and fresh green twigs,<br>\
when dry: produced fresh shoots in its dry parts:<br>\
(TA:) it (herbage) became somewhat restored to<br>\
a good state after having been eaten: (K, * TA:)<br>\
or grew after having been eaten. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He<br>\
(a man, S) magnified himself; behaved proudly,<br>\
haughtily, or insolently. (S, A, K.)<br>\
-A2-  (assumed tropical:)  He (a<br>\
man) obtained wealth, or property: (K:) but<br>\
Lh explains it as meaning, intransitively, he<br>\
obtained wealth, or property. (TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْجَبَرَ see 1, latter part, in two places.<br>\

إِجْتَبَرَ see 1, in five places. You say also, أَصَابَتْهُ<br>\
مُصِيبَةٌ لَا يَجْتَبِرُهَا [(assumed tropical:)  A calamity befell him from<br>\
which he will not recover]; i. e. مِنْهَا ↓ لَا مَجْبَرَ<br>\
[(assumed tropical:)  there is no recovering from it]. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
إِسْتَجْبَرَ see 1, latter part.<br>\
-A2-  استجبرهُ (tropical:)  He exerted himself much, or exceedingly, or to the<br>\
utmost, in paying frequent attention to him,<br>\
taking care of him, or putting his affairs into<br>\
a right, or proper, state. (A.)<br>\
جَبْرٌ, in computation, (assumed tropical:)  The addition of something for the purpose of reparation. (TA.)<br>\
[Hence, الجَبْرُ (assumed tropical:)  Algebra; more commonly called<br>\
الجَبْرُ وَالمُقَابَلَةُ perfective addition and compensative subtraction; or restoration and compensation; because of the frequency of these operations<br>\
in the reduction of equations.]<br>\
-A2-  The contr. of<br>\
قَدَرٌ: (S, Msb, K:) it is the assertion that God<br>\
compels his servants, or mankind, to commit acts<br>\
of disobedience; (Msb;) the virtual denial that<br>\
actions proceed from man, and attributing them<br>\
to God; the sect that hold the tenet thus termed<br>\
asserting that man, with respect to his actions, is<br>\
like the feather suspended in the air; whereas<br>\
قَدَرٌ signifies the “ virtual attributing of optional,<br>\
or voluntary, actions to man; asserting that<br>\
man creates his own optional, or voluntary,<br>\
actions: ” (IbrD:) A &#39;Obeyd says that it is a<br>\
post-classical term. (S.)<br>\
-A3-  A king; (AA, T,<br>\
M, K;) of uncertain derivation: (M:) and a<br>\
slave, or servant: (A &#39;Obeyd, Kr, K, &amp;c.:) thus<br>\
bearing two contr. significations: (K:) and a<br>\
man: (AA, A &#39;Obeyd, K, &amp;c.:) [see جَبْرَئِيلُ:]<br>\
and a young man: and [a] courageous [man]. (K.)<br>\
-A4-  [Also, app., Aloes-wood: الجَبْرُ is explained<br>\
in the K as signifying العُودُ, which means wood<br>\
in general, as well as aloes-wood in particular;<br>\
and to this is added in the TA, الذى يُجْبَرُ بِهِ, as<br>\
though the meaning were the wood with which<br>\
one sets bones; but I think that يُجْبَرُ is a mistranscription for يُجَمَّرُ; and that the meaning is<br>\
aloes-wood with which one fumigates.]<br>\

and ↓ جَبَرُوَّةٌ (S, K) and ↓ جَبْرُوَّةٌ (K) and ↓ جَبَرُوتٌ<br>\
(S, Msb, K, one of the forms most known, of the<br>\
measure فَعَلُوتٌ, like مَلَكُوتٌ and رَهَبُوتٌ and رَغَبُوتٌ<br>\
and رَحَمُوتٌ, said to be the only other words of<br>\
this measure, though, as MF says, this requires<br>\
consideration, TA) and ↓ جُبْرُوتٌ (K) and ↓ جَبْرَؤُوتٌ<br>\
(Et-Tedmuree, TA) and ↓ جَبَرُوتَى (K, like رَحَمُوتَى,<br>\

Kr) and ↓ جُبُّورٌ (Lh, TA) and ↓ جُبُورَةٌ and ↓ تَجْبَارٌ,<br>\
(K,) all inf. ns., (TA,) [or simple substs.,] meaning The quality denoted by the epithet جَبَّارٌ; (K;)<br>\
i. e. self-magnification, pride, haughtiness, or insolence; or proud, haughty, or insolent, behaviour; (S, Msb, K;) &amp;c. (K, TA.) Hence,<br>\
مَا كَانَتْ نُبُوَّةٌ إِلَّا تَنَاسَخَهَا مُلْكٌ جَبَرِيَّةً [There has<br>\
been no prophetic office but a kingly office has<br>\
succeeded in its place through some one&#39;s selfmagnification, pride, haughtiness, or insolence];<br>\
i. e., but kings have magnified themselves, or<br>\
behaved proudly or haughtily or insolently, after<br>\
it. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  الجَبَرِيَّةُ (S, K) and الجَبْرِيَّةُ,<br>\
(Th, Msb,) or the latter is a mispronunciation,<br>\
or is the correct form, (K,) and the former is so<br>\
pronounced in order to assimilate it to القَدَرِيَّةُ;<br>\
(Msb, K; *) the latter is the pronunciation of the<br>\
scholastic theologians of the persuasion of EshSháfi&#39;ee (El-Háfidh in the “ Tabseer,” B) in old<br>\
times, but the term used in the conventional<br>\
language of the modern scholastic theologians<br>\
is ↓ المُجْبَرَةُ; (B;) and الجبريّة, also, is a postclassical term; (TA;) The contr. of القَدَرِيَّةُ;<br>\
(S, K;) the sect who hold the tenet termed جَبْرٌ<br>\
[q. v.]; (Msb;) a sect of those who follow<br>\
their own natural desires, whose founder was El-<br>\
Hoseyn Ibn-Mohammad En-Nejjár El-Basree,<br>\
who assert that man has no power; that [what<br>\
are termed] voluntary motions are of the same<br>\
predicament as a tremour; though this does not<br>\
oblige them to deny the imposition of duties;<br>\
(Lb, TA;) a sect who assert that God compels<br>\
his servants, or mankind, to commit sins: (AHeyth,<br>\
TA:) n. un. ↓ جَبَرِىٌّ or جَبْرِىٌّ. (Msb.)<br>\

جَبْرَئِيلُ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) imperfectly decl.,<br>\
because having the quality of a proper name and<br>\
that of a foreign word, or being a compound<br>\
regarded as forming a single word, as some say,<br>\
(TA,) originally Syriac, or Hebrew, [?,]<br>\
(Esh-Shiháb [El-Khafájee],) A proper name of<br>\
an angel; (TA;) [Gabriel: and also, of a man:]<br>\
signifying the servant of God: (A &#39;Obeyd, S,<br>\
Msb, K, TA:) or (rather, TA) the man of God:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, TA:) being said to be composed of<br>\
جَبْرٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) signifying “ servant,” or<br>\
“ slave,” (Msb, TA,) or rather “ man,” (TA,) and<br>\
إِيلٌ, (S, Msb, TA,) signifying “ God: ” (Msb,<br>\
TA:) or both together signify the servant of<br>\
the Compassionate: or the servant of the Mighty,<br>\
or Glorious: (TA:) this form of the word is of<br>\
the dialects of Keys and Temeem: (TA:) and<br>\
there are other dial. vars.; namely, ↓ جَبْرَيِيلُ,<br>\
without ء , and ↓ جَبْرَائِيلُ , (S, K,) and ↓ جَبْرَايِيلُ ,<br>\

(Es-Suyootee, TA,) and ↓ جِبْرِيلُ, (S, Msb, K, which<br>\
is the form most known and most chaste, and<br>\
is of the dial. of El-Hijáz, TA,) and ↓ جَبْرِيلُ,<br>\
(Msb, K, reckoned of weak authority by Fr,<br>\
because the measure فَعِّيل [or فَعْلِيل] does not<br>\
exist in the language, for as to سَمْوِيل, mentioned<br>\
by Esh-Shiháb as against the objection of Fr, it is<br>\
of the measure فَعْوِيل, MF, TA,) and ↓ جَبْرَيْلُ,<br>\

جُبَارٌ A thing of which no account, or for which<br>\

for it. (S and Msb from a trad.) And البِئْرُ جُبَارٌ<br>\
[The well is a thing for which no mulct is<br>\
exacted]: i. e., if a man fall into an ancient well,<br>\

mulct: (TA:) or, as some say, it relates to a<br>\
hired man&#39;s descending into a well to cleanse it,<br>\

أَفْعَلَ except دَرَّاكٌ [q. v.] from أَدْرَكَ: (Az, TA:)<br>\
or, accord. to Fr, from جَبَرَ as syn. with أَجْبَرَ:<br>\
(Msb:) it is also explained as meaning the Supreme; the High above his creatures: (Az, TA:)<br>\
or the Unattainable; and hence applied to the<br>\
palm-tree [of which the branches cannot be<br>\
reached by the hand]: (IAmb, TA:) or it may<br>\
signify (tropical:)  the Restorer of the poor to wealth or<br>\

(نَخْلَةٌ), signifies (tropical:)  Tall and young; (Seer, K,<br>\
TA;) as also ↓ جُبَّارٌ: (K:) or is applied to palmtrees collectively (نَخْلٌ), and signifies tall, and<br>\
