sheep or goat, that thou mightest slaughter it:<br>\
(A:) [but] accord. to ISk, one does not say<br>\
أَجْزَرْتُهُمْ نَاقَةً, because a she-camel is fit for other<br>\

to some, one should not say اجزرهُ جَزُورًا, but<br>\

old man أَجْزَرْتَ يَا شَيْخُ, meaning, Thou hast<br>\
attained to the fit time for thy dying, O old<br>\
man: and he would say, أَىْ بَنِىَّ وَتُحْتَضَرُونَ,<br>\

[coll. gen. ns., meaning Carrots, or the carrot;]<br>\
a certain root, (أَرُومَة,) which is eaten, (S, K,)<br>\
well known: (TA:) n. un. with ة; (K;) or<br>\
جَزَرَةٌ: (As, S, Msb:) the best kind is the red and<br>\
sweet, which grows in winter: it is hot in the<br>\
extreme of the second degree; moist in the first<br>\
degree; (TA;) diuretic; (K, TA;) lenitive;<br>\
emollient; (TA;) strengthening to the venereal<br>\
faculty; emmenagogue: the putting of its pounded<br>\
leaves upon festering ulcers is advantageous: (K,<br>\

and mustard. (TA.) ―<br>\

جِزَرٌ: see جَزَرٌ, in three places.<br>\
جِزَارٌ The time of the cutting off of the fruit of<br>\
palm-trees. (Yz, TA.) [See also 1.]<br>\
جَزُورٌ A camel [that is slaughtered, or to be<br>\
slaughtered]; (K;) applied to the male and the<br>\
female: (S, Msb:) or (as some say, Sgh, Msb)<br>\
properly a she-camel that is slaughtered: (Sgh,<br>\
Msb, K:) but the former is the correct assertion;<br>\
(TA;) though the word is fem., (IAmb, S, Msb,<br>\
TA,) on the authority of hearsay; (TA;) therefore you say, رَعَتِ الجَزُورء [the camel for slaughter<br>\
pastured]: (IAmb, Msb:) or when used alone,<br>\
it is fem., because what are slaughtered are mostly<br>\
she-camels: (TA:) and when used as a common<br>\
term, it implies the like of predominance [of the<br>\
fem. gender]: (Háshiyeh of Esh-Shiháb, TA:)<br>\
[the shares into which the جزور is divided in the<br>\
game called المَيْسِر are described voce بَدْءٌ:] pl.<br>\
جُزُرٌ (S, Msb, K) and جَزَائِرُ and جُزُرَاتٌ, (Msb,<br>\
K,) the last of which is pl. of جُزُرٌ, like as طُرُقَاتٌ<br>\
is of طُرُقٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also جَزَرٌ.<br>\
جُزَارَةٌ, of a camel, The extremities; (S, A;)<br>\
namely, (S,) the fore and kind legs, (اليَدَانِ<br>\
وَالرِّجْلَانِ, S, K,) and the head, (S,) or neck: (A,<br>\
K:) because the slaughterer receives them; (S;)<br>\
they being his hire, (S, K,) or right, (A,) not<br>\
being included among the shares in the game<br>\
called المَيْسِر. (TA.) But when a horse is said<br>\
to be عَبْلُ الجُزَارَةِ, (S,) or ضَخْمُ الجُزَارَةِ, (M,)<br>\
what is meant is thickness of the fore and hind<br>\
legs, and abundance of sinews; and the head is<br>\
not included, because largeness of the head, in a<br>\
horse, is a fault. (S, M.)<br>\
جِزَارَةٌ The trade of him who slaughters camels<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K, * TA) and other animals. (Msb.)<br>\
جَزِيرَةٌ (tropical:)  An island; land in the sea [or in a<br>\
river], from which the water has flowed away, so<br>\
that it appears; (Az, Mgh;) and in like manner,<br>\
land which a torrent does not overflow, but which<br>\
it surrounds; (Az, TA;) land from which the<br>\
tide retires; as also ↓ جَزَرٌ: (K:) so called<br>\
because cut off from the main land: (S:) or<br>\
because of the retiring of the water from it:<br>\
(Msb:) pl. جَزَائِرُ: (S, Mgh:) [also, a peninsula:]<br>\
and a piece of ground or land. (Kr, TA.)<br>\
جَزَّارٌ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ جِزِّيرٌ (K) and<br>\
↓ جَازِرٌ (A) One who slaughters camels (A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K) and other animals. (Msb.)<br>\
جِزِّيرٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
جَازِرٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
مَجْزَرٌ, (Msb, K,) or مَجْزِرٌ, with kesr to the ز,<br>\
(S, Ibn-Málik,) contr to rule, as the aor. of the verb<br>\
is with damm, (Ibn-Málik, TA,) and sometimes<br>\
↓ مَجْزَرَةٌ [or مَجْزِرَةٌ], (Msb,) A place where camels<br>\
are slaughtered, (S, Msb, K,) and other animals,<br>\
(Msb,) namely, bulls and cows and sheep and<br>\
goats, and where their flesh is sold: pl. مَجَازِرُ.<br>\
(TA.) In a trad. of &#39;Omar, persons are enjoined<br>\
to avoid مَجَازِر, (S, TA,) meaning as above;<br>\
because of their uncleanness; (TA;) or because<br>\
the witnessing of the slaughter of animals hardens<br>\
the heart and dispels mercy: (IAth, TA:) or the<br>\
meaning is, places of assembly; because a camel<br>\
is slaughtered only where people are collected<br>\
together: (S, TA:) the ↓ مَجْزَرَة is one of the<br>\
places in which it is forbidden to perform the<br>\
usual prayers. (Mgh.)<br>\
