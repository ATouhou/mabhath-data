ters which he had heard from his sheykhs, to teach<br>\
the same to others]. (TA.) The licentiate is termed<br>\
↓ مُجَازٌ: and the matters which he relates are termed<br>\
↓ مُجَازَاتٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  اجاز البَيْعَ, (A, Mgh, K,) and<br>\
النِّكَاحَ, (A, Mgh,) and العَقْدَ, (Msb,) He (the<br>\
judge, A, Mgh) made the sale, (A, Mgh, K,) and<br>\

(Mgh.) And [in like manner] اجاز رَأْيَهُ, and<br>\

-A3-  أَجَازَنِى (S,<br>\
K *) (tropical:)  He gave me water for, (S,) or he watered<br>\

أَجَازَهُ مَآءً يَجُوزُ بِهِ الطَّرِيقَ (assumed tropical:)  He gave him water<br>\
wherewith to travel the road. (A.) And أَجِزْنِى<br>\
مَآءً Give thou me some water that I may go my<br>\
way, and pass from thee. (Aboo-Bekr, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, (Aboo-Bekr, TA,) اجازهُ بِجَائِزَةٍ, (Aboo-Bekr, TA,) and اجازهُ بِجَائِزَةٍ سَنِيَّةٍ, (S, A,) (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
(the Sultán) gave him a gift, or present, (Aboo-Bekr, TA,) and he gave him a gift, or present, of<br>\
high estimation. (S, A. *) Or the origin of the<br>\
expression was this: Katan the son of &#39;Owf, of<br>\
the tribe of Benoo-Hilál-Ibn-&#39;Ámir-Ibn-Saasa&#39;ah,<br>\
gave the government of Fáris to &#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbás; and El-Ahnaf passing by him with his<br>\
army on an expedition to Khurásán, he waited<br>\
for them upon a bridge, and said, أَجِيزُوهُمْ [Make<br>\
ye them to pass over]; and he began to mention<br>\
the lineage of each man and to give him according<br>\
to his rank: (S:) or from the fact that a certain<br>\
commander, having a river between him and an<br>\
opposing force, said, مَنْ جَازَ هٰذَا النَّهْرَ فَلَهُ كَذَا<br>\
[Whoso passeth this river shall have such a thing];<br>\
and whenever one passed over, he received a<br>\
جَائِزَة. (TA.) You say also, أَجَازَهُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
gave him. (TA.) And it is said in a trad.,<br>\
أَجِيزُوا الوَفْدَ بِنَحْوِ مَا كُنْتُ أُجِيزُهُمْ بِهِ Give ye to<br>\
the party who come as envoys, or the like, a<br>\
similar جَائِزَة to that which I used to give them.<br>\

-A2-  تجوّز فِى صَلَاتِهِ He relaxed, or<br>\
remitted, in his prayer; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K, TA;)<br>\
and so in other things; (A;) and abridged it;<br>\
and was quick in it: said to be from الجَوْزُ “the<br>\
act of traversing, and going, or passing along:”<br>\
(TA:) or did less than was sufficient in it.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, تجوّز فِى أَخْذِ الدَّرَاهِمِ, (A,<br>\
Mgh,) or تجوّز الدَّرَاهِمَ, (K,) He accepted the<br>\
dirhems, or pieces of money, as current; did not<br>\
reject them: (A, Mgh:) see 1: or he accepted<br>\
them as they were, or notwithstanding what was<br>\
in them: (Lth, TA:) or he accepted them notwithstanding what was intermixed with them,<br>\
(K, TA,) [of bad money,] concealed therein, and<br>\
notwithstanding their fewness. (TA.) In the<br>\
phrase التَّجَوُّزُ بِدُونِ الحَقِّ [The accepting less<br>\
than what was due], the inf. n. is made trans.<br>\
by means of بِ because it implies the meaning<br>\
of الرِّضَا [which is made trans. by the same means].<br>\
(Mgh.) ↓ تَجَاوَزْ also occurs in the sense of تَجَوَّزْ<br>\
in a trad. of Ibn-Rawáhah: هٰذَا لَكَ وَتَجَاوَزْ فِى<br>\
القَسْمِ This is thine, or for thee, and be thou<br>\
remiss, or not extreme, in, or with respect to, the<br>\
division: and is allowable, though we have not<br>\
heard it. (Mgh.) You say also, تَجَوَّزَ فِى هٰذَا<br>\
الأَمْرِ مَا لَمْ يَتَجَوَّزْ فِى غَيْرِهِ He bore patiently, or<br>\
with silence and forgiveness, and with feigned<br>\
neglect, or connivance, in this affair, or case,<br>\
what he did not so bear in another. (K, * TA.)<br>\

-b3-  See also 6, in three places.<br>\
-A3-  تجوّز فِى كَلَامِهِ<br>\
He made use of a trope, or tropes, in his speech.<br>\
(S, K.) [See مَجَازٌ, below.]<br>\

-A2-  تجاوز i. q. أَفْرَطَ, [i.e., جاوز الحَدَّ, explained<br>\
above,] فِيهِ in it, or with respect to it. (K. See<br>\
3.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تجاوز عَنْهُ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb,) and ↓ تجوّز;<br>\
(S, A, Mgh;) and تجاوزعَنْ ذَنْبِهِ, (A, K,) and<br>\
↓ تجوّز, and ↓ جاوز; (K;) He (God, S, A, or a<br>\
man, Msb) passed him by, or over, without punishing him; or forgave him; (S, A, Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
namely, an evil-doer; (A, Mgh, Msb;) and He<br>\
passed by, or over, without punishing, or forgave,<br>\
his sin or offence. (A, K. *) You say, اَللّٰهُمَّ تَجَاوَزْ<br>\
عَنِّى, and عَنِّى ↓ تَجَوَّزْ, O God, pass me by, or<br>\
over, without punishing me; or forgive me. (S,<br>\
A.) تجاوز عَنْهُ, followed by a noun in the accus.<br>\
case, also signifies He forgave him a thing. (L.)<br>\
And the same alone, He feigned himself neglectful<br>\
of it; he connived at it. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Also, this<br>\
last phrase alone, He transcended it.] ―<br>\
-b4-  تَجَاوَزْ<br>\
فِى القَسْمِ: see 5.<br>\
8<br>\

one that comes to us for water is a single water-ing, or giving of water to drink; then he is<br>\

nothing more than that to receive from us. (TA.)<br>\

who come to one as envoys or the like: (Mgh:)<br>\
or provisions for a day and a night given to a<br>\

الضِّيَافَةُ ثَلَاثَةُ أَيَّامٍ وَجَائِزَتُهُ يَوْمٌ وَلَيْلَةٌ وَمَا زَادَ فَهُوَ<br>\

has at hand, not exceeding his usual custom;<br>\
then he shall give him that wherewith to journey<br>\

مُتَبَرَّزٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  A trope; a word, or phrase,<br>\
used in a sense different from that which it was<br>\
originally applied to denote, by reason of some<br>\
analogy, or connexion, between the two senses;<br>\
as, for instance, أَسَدٌ, properly signifying “ a<br>\
lion,” applied to “ a courageous man; ” (KT,<br>\
&amp;c.;) what passes beyond the meaning to which<br>\
it is originally applied; (TA;) [being of the<br>\
measure مَفْعَلٌ in the sense of the measure فَاعِلٌ;]<br>\
contr. of حَقِيقَةٌ. (K.) [This is also called مَجَازٌ<br>\
لُغَوِىٌّ, and مَجَازٌ لُغَةً; to distinguish it from what<br>\
is termed مَجَازٌ عُرْفِىٌّ, and مَجَازٌ عُرْفًا, which is A<br>\
word, or phrase, so little used in a particular<br>\
proper sense as to be, in that sense, conventionally<br>\
regarded as tropical; as, for instance, دَابَّةٌ in<br>\
the sense of “ a man,” or “ a human being; ”<br>\
it being commonly applied to “ a beast,” and<br>\
especially to “ a horse ” or “ a mule ” or “ an<br>\
ass. ”] A حَقِيقَة, when little used, becomes what<br>\
is termed مَجَازٌ عُرْفًا. (Mz, 24th نوع.) The مَجَاز<br>\
is either what is termed اِسْتِعَارَةٌ [i. e. a metaphor]<br>\
(as أَسَدٌ used as meaning “ a courageous man ”),<br>\
or مَجَازٌ مُرْسَلٌ [a loose trope] (as يَدٌ used as<br>\
meaning “ a benefit,” “ benefaction,” “ favour,”<br>\
or “ boon ”). (KT, &amp;c.) [مَجَازٌ also signifies A<br>\
tropical meaning.]<br>\
مُجَازٌ: and مُجَازَاتٌ: see 4, in the middle of the<br>\

woman who has no guardian and affiancer]: and<br>\
Shureyh is related to have said, إِذَا أَنْكَحَ الْمُجِيزَانِ<br>\
