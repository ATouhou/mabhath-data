(S, TA.) One says, عَلَيْكَ بِالمُدَارَاةِ وَالمُجَامَلَةِ<br>\
[Keep thou to blandishment and coaxing, &amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اجمل He collected a thing (Msb, K) without<br>\
discrimination, or distinction, (Msb,) or from a<br>\

K,) i. e., such as is termed رَبَاعٍ [or one in his<br>\
seventh year], (S,) or such as is termed بَازِلٌ [or<br>\
one in his ninth year], or, accord. to Z, one that<br>\
had covered. (TA.)<br>\
جَمْلٌ: see جَمَلٌ.<br>\
جُمْلٌ: see جُمْلَةٌ and جُمَّلٌ; the latter in two<br>\
places.<br>\
جَمَلٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ جَمْلٌ, (K,)<br>\
which latter is so rare that it is said by some to<br>\
be used only in poetry, in cases of necessity,<br>\
(MF,) but it is a correct dial. var., (TA,) a word<br>\
of well-known meaning; (K;) i. e., [A he-camel;<br>\
but commonly applied to the camel as a generic<br>\
term; in like manner as جَامِلٌ is applied to the<br>\
males and the females; but properly,] the male<br>\
of the إِبِل; (TA;) the mate of the نَاقَة; (Fr, S,<br>\
Mgh;) among camels, corresponding to رَجُلٌ<br>\
among us; (Sh, Msb;) نَاقَةٌ corresponding to<br>\
مَرْأَةٌ, and بَكْرٌ to غُلَامٌ, and بَكْرَةٌ to جَارِيَةٌ; (Sh,<br>\
TA;) [in general] peculiarly applied to the male;<br>\
(Msb;) exceptionally to the female, as in the<br>\
saying شَرِبْتُ لَبَنَ جَمَلِى, (K,) i. e., I drank the<br>\
milk of my she-camel; but ISd doubts the correctness of this: (TA:) [as corresponding to<br>\
رَجُلٌ among us, it signifies a full-grown hecamel:] or it signifies such as is termed رَبَاعٍ [or<br>\
one in his seventh year]: (S, ISd, K:) or such as<br>\
is termed جَذَعٌ [or one in his fifth year]: (ISd,<br>\
K:) or such as is termed بَازِلٌ [or one in his ninth<br>\
year]: (ISd, Mgh, Msb, K:) or such as is termed<br>\
ثَنِىٌّ [or one in his sixth year]: (ISd, K:) or,<br>\
accord. to Z, one that has covered: (TA:) [see<br>\
also بَعِيرٌ, and بَكْرٌ, and قَعُودٌ:] pl. [of pauc.]<br>\
أَجْمَالٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) which may be pl. of<br>\
جَمْلٌ, (TA,) and أَجْمُلٌ (Msb) and [of mult.]<br>\
جِمَالٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and جُمْلٌ (K) and جِمَالَةٌ<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K) and [quasi-pl. n.] جُمَالَةٌ and جَمَالَةٌ<br>\
and جَامِلٌ, (K,) which last is disallowed by some,<br>\
as will be seen below, (TA,) and [pl. pl.] جِمَالَاتٌ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) which is pl. of جِمَالٌ, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
or it may be pl. of جِمَالَةٌ, (TA,) and جُمَالَاتٌ<br>\
[which see also voce جُمَّلٌ] and جَمَالَاتٌ (K) and<br>\
جَمَائِلُ, (S, K,) pl. of جمالة and جِمال, (Ham<br>\
p. 527,) and أَجَامِلُ. (K.) One says of camels,<br>\
when they are males, without any female among<br>\
them, هٰذِهِ جِمَالَةُ بَنِى فُلَانٍ [These are the hecamels of the sons of such a one]. (ISk, S. [See<br>\
also جُمَالَةٌ.]) And they said also جِمَالَانِ [meaning Two herds of camels, thus forming a dual<br>\
from the pl. جِمَالٌ], like as they said لِقَاحَانِ.<br>\
(ISd, in TA voce خَيْلٌ.) It is said in a prov.,<br>\
مَااسْتَتَرَ مَنْ قَادَ الجَمَلَ [He does not conceal<br>\
himself who leads the he-camel]. (TA.) And in<br>\
another prov., اِتَّخَذَ اللَّيْلَ جَمَلًا (assumed tropical:)  He journeyed<br>\
all the night. (K, TA. [See also Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov. i. 230.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  الجَمَلُ also signifies A certain<br>\
fish (IAar, K) of the sea, (IAar, TA,) thirty<br>\
cubits in length: (K:) or, as some say, جَمَلُ<br>\
البَحْرِ is the name of a very great fish, also called<br>\
the بَال, [i. e., the whale,] thirty cubits in length:<br>\
accord. to some, this, (TA,) or جَمَلُ المَآءِ, (Mgh,)<br>\
is what is called the كَوْسَج and كُبَع (Mgh, TA)<br>\
and لُخْم, [i. e., xiphias, or sword-fish,] which<br>\
passes by nothing without cutting it. (TA.) [In<br>\
the present day, جَمَلُ البَحْرِ is an appellation of<br>\
The pelican.] ―<br>\
-b3-  عَيْنُ الجَمَلِ, in the dial. of<br>\
Egypt, i. q. الشَّاه بَلُّوط [The chestnut]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
جَمَلٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  A woman&#39;s husband. (L in<br>\
arts. اخذ and قيد. See 2 in each of those arts.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  Also (tropical:)  Palm-trees; (K;) as being likened to<br>\
the he-camel in respect of their tallness and their<br>\
bigness and their produce: in some of the copies<br>\
of the K, النَّحْلُ is erroneously put for النَّخْلُ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See also جُمَّلٌ.<br>\
جُمَلٌ: see جُمَّلٌ, in three places.<br>\
جُمُلٌ A company, or congregated body, of men.<br>\
(ISd, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also جُمَّلٌ.<br>\
جُمْلَةٌ A strand of a thick rope: pl. [or rather<br>\
coll. gen. n.] ↓ جُمْلٌ: or many strands of a rope,<br>\
put together [to compose a cable: see جُمَّلٌ].<br>\
(TA, in two places in this art.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, app.,<br>\
(TA,) The aggregate of a thing; (K;) the sum,<br>\
whole, or total; (KL, PS;) it implies muchness,<br>\
or numerousness, and means any aggregate unseparated: (Er-Rághib, TA:) pl. جُمَلٌ. (S.)<br>\
[جُمْلَةٌ مِنْ مَالٍ generally means A large sum of<br>\
money; and in a similar sense جُمْلَةٌ is often used<br>\
in relation to various things.] It is said in the<br>\
Kur [xxv. 34], وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَوْ لَا نُزِّلَ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
الْقُرْآنُ جُمْلَةً وَاحِدَةً, i. e., [And those who disbelieved said, Wherefore was not the Kur-án sent<br>\
down, or revealed, to him] aggregated? (TA:)<br>\
[or in one aggregate?] or at once? (Bd.) [Hence,<br>\
بِالجُمْلَةِ as meaning Upon the whole; to sum up.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, in grammar, (TA,) [A proposition; a clause; a phrase; sometimes, a sentence;]<br>\
a phrase composed of a subject and an attribute,<br>\
[i. e., composed of an inchoative and an enunciative, (in which case it is termed جُمْلَةٌ اسْمِيَّةٌ,) or<br>\
of a verb and its agent, (in which case it is termed<br>\
جُمْلَةٌ فِعْلِيَّةٌ,)] (KT, TA,) [&amp;c.,] whether affording<br>\
a complete sense, as زَيْدٌ قَائِمٌ [Zeyd is standing],<br>\
or not, as إِنْ يُكْرِمْنِى [If he treat me with honour].<br>\
(KT.)<br>\
جَمْلَآءُ: see جَمِيلٌ.<br>\
جَمَلُونَ A building, or structure, in the form<br>\
of a camel&#39;s hump: (TA:) [a ridged roof: so in<br>\
the present day: pl. جَمَالِينُ.]<br>\
جَمَالٌ inf. n. of جَمُلَ: (S, Mgh, Msb:) [when<br>\
used as a simple subst., meaning] Beauty, goodliness, comeliness, or pleasingness, syn. حُسْنٌ, (S,<br>\
M, Mgh, * K,) in person, (M, K,) and goodness<br>\
in action, or actions, or behaviour, (M, TA,) or<br>\
also, in moral character: (K:) or elegance, or<br>\
prettiness; i. e., delicacy, or minuteness, of<br>\
beauty: (Sb, Msb:) or much goodness, or beauty<br>\
or goodliness or comeliness, in the mind, or in the<br>\
person, or in the actions or behaviour; and also,<br>\
much goodness that is communicated from its<br>\
possessor to another: (Er-Rághib, TA:) accord.<br>\
to As, [when relating to the person,] حُسْنٌ is in<br>\
the eyes; and جَمَالٌ, in the nose. (TA in art.<br>\
حسن.) [See also جَمِيلٌ.] One says, جَمَالَكَ أَنْ<br>\
لَا تَفْعَلَ كَذَا, (ISd, K,) or أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا, (IDrd,<br>\
TA,) meaning, Keep to that which is most comely<br>\
for thee to do, and do not thus. (IDrd, ISd, K.<br>\
[But see what follows.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Patience. (Mgh<br>\
in art. خص.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb says,<br>\
جَمَالَكَ أَيُّهَا القَلْبُ القَرِيحُ<br>\
سَتَلْقَى مَنْ تُحِبُّ فَتَسْتَرِيحُ<br>\
(S, * TA, the former of which cites only the first<br>\
hemistich, and the latter substitutes الجَرِيحُ for<br>\
its syn. القَرِيحُ,) meaning, [Keep thy patience, O<br>\
thou wounded heart: thou wilt find whom thou<br>\
lovest, and be at rest: or] keep to thy patience,<br>\
or thy constraint of thyself to be patient, and thy<br>\
shrinking from what is foul, and be not impatient<br>\
in an evil manner. (S, TA.)<br>\
جُمَالٌ: see جَمِيلٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and جُمَالَةٌ.<br>\
جَمُولٌ A piece of fat melted. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
[See also جَمِيلٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  A fat woman. (IAar, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  A person, (K,) or woman, (M,) who melts<br>\
fat. (M, K.)<br>\
جَمِيلٌ Melted fat: (S, Mgh:) or melting fat:<br>\
or fat that is melted and collected: (K, TA:) or<br>\
fat that is melted, and, whenever it drips, made<br>\
to drip upon bread, and then replaced over the<br>\
fire [that it may drip again: see جَمَلَ]: (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ جُمَالَةٌ, also, signifies [the same; or] melted<br>\
grease. (Mgh, * TA.) [See also جَمُولٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  Hence,<br>\
accord. to Abu-l-&#39;Alà, because, when a man becomes fat and in good condition, his جَمَال becomes<br>\
apparent, (Ham p. 155,) as also ↓ جُمَالٌ and ↓ جُمَّالٌ,<br>\
(K,) or this last denotes a higher degree of beauty<br>\
than جَمِيلٌ, (S, Sgh,) and has no broken pl.,<br>\
(TA,) and ↓ أَجْمَلُ, (TA,) Beautiful, goodly,<br>\
comely, or pleasing, (S, M, Mgh, K,) in person,<br>\
(M, K,) and good in action, or actions, or behaviour, (M, TA,) or also in moral character:<br>\

the French beau, &amp;c.; and so حَسَنٌ:] or elegant,<br>\
or pretty; i. e., delicately, or minutely, beautiful:<br>\
(Msb:) [or characterized by much goodness, or<br>\
beauty or goodliness or comeliness, in his mind, or<br>\
in his person, or in his actions or behaviour; and<br>\
also characterized by much goodness communicated<br>\
from him to others: see جَمَالٌ:] pl. of the first<br>\
جَمَالٌ: (TA:) fem. جَمِيلَةٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
applied to a woman; (S, Mgh, Msb;) as also<br>\
↓ جَمْلَآءُ, (Ks, S, K,) [said to be] an instance of [the<br>\
measure] فَعْلَآءُ having no [masc. of the measure]<br>\
أَفْعَلُ; (TA;) [but see above;] or this is applied to<br>\
any female as signifying perfect, or complete, in<br>\
body. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.) It is said in a trad., إِنَّ اللّٰهَ<br>\
جَمِيلٌ يُحِبُّ الجِمَالَ Verily God is comely in<br>\
deeds, (TA,) or an Abundant Bestower of good<br>\
things: He loveth those who are of the like character. (Er-Rághib, TA.) And you say, عَامَلَهُ<br>\
بَالجَمِيلِ [He treated him with comely, or pleasing,<br>\
behaviour]. (TA.) And مَاسَحَهُ بِالجَمِيل [He<br>\
coaxed him, or wheedled him, with comely, or<br>\
pleasing, behaviour or speech]. (ISd, K. [See 3.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  أَبُو جَمِيلٍ [The kind of plants called] البَقْل;<br>\
because they embellish by their presence, and<br>\
render good, the seasoning of food; or because<br>\
they take away the جَمِيل, i. e., the grease of the<br>\
flesh-meat, and dry up the food. (Har p. 227.)<br>\
جَمَالَةٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
جُمَالَةَ: see جُمَّلٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and جَمِيلٌ.<br>\
-A3-  Also A<br>\
herd, or distinct number, of camels; (K;) mentioned before as a pl. of جَمَلٌ [q. v.]: (TA:) or,<br>\
of she-camels among which is no he-camel; as<br>\
also ↓ جِمَالَةٌ and ↓ جَمَالَةٌ; (K;) but this is contradictory to a saying of ISk [respecting جِمَالَةٌ],<br>\
mentioned above [voce جَمَلٌ; where all these<br>\
three words are said to be pls. of جَمَلٌ]: (TA:)<br>\
and also horses: pl. ↓ جُمَالٌ, which is extr. [as a<br>\
pl.; though, in relation to جُمَالَةٌ, it may be a<br>\
coll. gen. n., forming its n. un. with ة]. (AA, K.)<br>\
جِمَالَةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
جَمِيلَةٌ A number of gazelles together: and of<br>\
pigeons. (Ibn-&#39; Abbád, K.)<br>\
جُمَالِىٌّ applied to a man, (S, Msb, K,) Large<br>\
in make: (S, Msb:) or tall in body: (Msb:) or<br>\
firm [in make], (K,) or big in limbs, complete in<br>\
make, (TA,) like a he-camel. (K, TA.) And<br>\
with ة applied to a she-camel, (S, K,) Resembling<br>\
a he-camel in greatness of make: (S:) or firm<br>\
(K, TA) in make, (TA,) like a he-camel (K, TA)<br>\
in greatness of make and in strength. (TA.)<br>\
جُمَّلٌ (S, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ جُمَلٌ and ↓ جُمْلٌ (K)<br>\
and ↓ جُمُلٌ and ↓ جَمَلٌ (IJ, K) [A cable;] the<br>\
rope of a ship, (S, K,) i. e., the thick rope thereof,<br>\
(TA,) that is also called قَلْسٌ, (S, TA,) consisting<br>\
of [a number of] ropes put together: (S:) and<br>\
↓ جُمَالَةٌ also signifies [the same; or] a thick rope,<br>\
because consisting of many strands put together;<br>\
pl. جُمَالَاتٌ; (Zj, TA;) which Mujáhid explains<br>\
as meaning the ropes of bridges; but I &#39;Ab, as<br>\
the ropes of ships, put together so as to be like<br>\
the waists of men [in thickness]. (TA.) In all<br>\
the forms mentioned above, except the last (جمالة),<br>\
the word is read in the phrase [in the Kur vii. 38],<br>\
حَتَّى يَلِجَ الجُمَّلُ فِى سَمِّ الخِيَاطِ [Until the cable<br>\
shall enter into the eye of the needle]: (K, TA:)<br>\
I &#39;Ab reads الجُمَّلُ, (S, TA,) and so do &#39;Alee and<br>\
many others: ↓ جُمْلٌ is pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]<br>\
of جُمْلَةٌ, a strand of a thick rope; or, accord. to<br>\
IJ, pl. of جَمَلٌ [q. v.]: the first is explained by<br>\
Fr as meaning ropes put together; but Aboo-Tálib thinks that he meant ↓ جُمَلٌ, without tesh-deed. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  حِسَابُ الجُمَّلِ, (S K,) thought<br>\
by IDrd to be not Arabic, (TA,) and ↓ الجُمَلِ,<br>\
(K,) but IDrd doubts its correctness, The calculation by means of the letters د ج ب ا, &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
جَمَّالٌ An owner, or an attendant, of a camel<br>\
or camels: (KL, TA: * [see also جامِلٌ:]) and<br>\
جَمَّالَةٌ owners, or attendants, of camels; (S, K,<br>\
TA;) similar to خَيَّالَةٌ and حَمَّارَةٌ; (S, TA;) as<br>\
the former is to حَمَّارٌ. (TA.) [See an ex. of the<br>\
latter in a verse cited voce إِذَا.]<br>\
جُمَّالٌ: see جَمِيلٌ.<br>\
جَامِلٌ [act. part. n. of جَمَلَ.<br>\
-A2-  And also part. n.<br>\
of جَمُلَ]. The Arabs say, اُجْمُلْ إِنْ كُنْتَ جَامِلًا<br>\
[Become beautiful, &amp;c., if thou be becoming beautiful, &amp;c.]: but when they mean the quality<br>\
[alone], they say, إِنَّهُ لَجَمِيلٌ [Verily he is beautiful, &amp;c.]. (Lh, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  A man possessing a<br>\
جَمَل [or he-camel]. (TA. [See also جَمَّالٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
A herd, or distinct number, of camels, (S, K, *<br>\
TA,) males and females, (TA,) with their pastors<br>\
and their owners: (S, K, TA: [also said in the<br>\
K to be a pl. of جَمَلٌ: in the CK, الجامِعُ is<br>\
erroneously put for الجَامِلُ:]) or a word formed to<br>\
denote a pl., meaning camels, (Ham pp. 122 and<br>\
490,) males and females; (Id p. 122;) derived<br>\
from جَمَلٌ; (Id. p. 490;) like بَاقِرٌ (Id. ib. and<br>\
TA) from بَقَرٌ, (Ham p. 490,) and كَالِبٌ [from<br>\
كَلْبٌ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
