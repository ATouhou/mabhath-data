جَنَزَهُ, aor.<br>\
جَنِزَ, (A, Msb, K,) and<br>\
جَنُزَ, (A,)<br>\
inf. n. جَنْزٌ, (TA,) He veiled, concealed, hid, or<br>\
covered, it. (A, Msb, K.)<br>\
-A2-  He collected it; or<br>\
gathered it together or up; (K;) as also ↓ جنّزِهُ,<br>\
inf. n. تَجْنِيزٌ. (Sgh, TA.) You say also, جُنَزَ الرَّجُلُ,<br>\
part. n. ↓ مَجْنُوزٌ, The man was gathered up [app.<br>\
as a corpse is gathered up in the grave-clothes]:<br>\
(TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  he died. (Har p. 122.)<br>\
2<br>\
جنّزهُ, inf. n. تَجْنِيزٌ: see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  It is used by<br>\
El-Hasan El-Basree as signifying He put it<br>\
(namely a corpse) upon the bier. (K, * TA.)<br>\
جِنَازَةٌ and جَنَازَةٌ signify the same, (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K,) namely, A dead person; a corpse: (K:)<br>\
but the former is the more chaste: (Msb:) or<br>\
the former signifies the dead person; and the<br>\
latter, the bier: (As, IAar, Msb, K:) or the<br>\
former, the bier; and the latter, the dead person:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, K:) so accord. to Th, as related by<br>\
Aboo-&#39;Amr Ez-Záhid: (Msb:) or the former is<br>\
said by the vulgar to mean the bier: (As, TA:)<br>\
or the former signifies the bier with the dead<br>\
person: (K:) or the dead person upon the bier:<br>\
(S:) and the bier is not so called unless the dead<br>\
person is upon it: (AAF:) when the dead person<br>\
is not upon it, it is called سَرِيرٌ and نَعْشٌ: (AAF,<br>\
S:) but the vulgar say جَنَازَةٌ, with fet-h; (S;)<br>\
which is not allowable: (Lth, As, Mgh, TA:)<br>\
or جَنَازَةٌ [so in the TA] signifies the man: or the<br>\
bier with the man: (En-Nadr, TA:) جنازة is<br>\
derived from جَنَزَهُ, in the first of the senses<br>\
assigned to it above: (A, Msb, TA:) so some<br>\
assert: (IDrd, TA:) but ISd says, I know not<br>\
whether this be correct: (TA:) or a جَنَازَة is so<br>\
called because the clothes are gathered together<br>\
when the man is upon the bier: (&#39;Abd-Allah<br>\
Ibn-El-Hasan, TA:) some say that it is Nabathean: (TA:) the pl. is جَنَائِزُ. (S.) The Arabs<br>\
say, تَرَكْتُهُ جِنَازَةً I left him a corpse, or dead.<br>\
(As, TA.) And ضُرِبَ الرَّجُلُ حَتَّى تُرِكَ جَنَازَةً [so<br>\
in the TA, The man was beaten until he was left<br>\
a corpse]. (ISh, TA.) And رُمِىَ فِى جِنَازَتِهِ,<br>\
meaning, He died: (Lth, Mgh:) or he has been<br>\
carried, or lifted, and put [into his bier]: this<br>\
they say when they give information of the death<br>\
of a man: (TA:) and they say also, طُعِنَ فِى<br>\
جِنَازَتِهِ, meaning the same. (Lth, Mgh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also جِنَازَةٌ [or جَنَازَةٌ] (tropical:)  A wine-skin [when emptied;<br>\
as though it were a body without a soul]. (K.)<br>\
A certain impudent man of the Arabs, &#39;Amr Ibn-<br>\
Ki&#39;ás, says,<br>\
وَكُنْتُ إِذَا أَرَى زِقًّا صَرِيعًا<br>\
يُنَاحُ عَلَى جَنَازَتِهِ بَكَيْتُ<br>\
[And I used, when I saw a wine-skin laid prostrate, its corpse being wailed over, to weep, or<br>\
accord. to Th, as is said in the TA in art. بكى,<br>\
to sing]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  Anything oppressive and<br>\
grievous, عَلَى قَوْمٍ to a people. (Lth, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A sick person. (Sgh, K.)<br>\
جَنَائِزِىٌّ, [from جَنَائِزُ, pl. of جَنَازَةٌ,] One who<br>\
recites [or chants the profession of the faith &amp;c.]<br>\
before the dead [in a funeral-procession]. (TA.)<br>\
