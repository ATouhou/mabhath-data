جيّر He plastered a watering-trough or tank<br>\
with جَيَّار. (TA.)<br>\
جَيْرِ, with kesr to the ر, (S, Mughnee, K, &amp;c.,)<br>\
like أَمْسِ; (Mughnee;) and جَيْرَ, like أَيْنَ; and<br>\
sometimes جَيْرٍ; (Mughnee, K;) or this, where<br>\
it occurs, is for جَيْرِ إِنَّ, and is properly written<br>\
جَيْرِنْ, إِنَّ in the sense of نَعَمْ being a corroborative of جَيْرِ, and its hemzeh and sheddeh and final<br>\
vowel being here suppressed: (Mughnee:) a<br>\
form of oath, (S, K,) or put in the place of an<br>\
oath, (IAmb, TA,) meaning Verily, or truly;<br>\
syn. حَقًّا: (S, K:) or a responsive particle,<br>\
(Mughnee,) meaning yes; syn. نَعَمْ [which is<br>\
most approved as responsive to an interrogation],<br>\
(Mughnee, K,) or أَجَلْ [which is most approved<br>\
as responsive to an affirmation]; (Sharh et-Tesheel, K;) not a noun in the sense of حَقًّا, for<br>\
were it so it would be an inf. n.; nor in the sense<br>\
of أَبَدًا, for were it so it would be an adv. n. of<br>\
time; and if it were a noun it would be decl.,<br>\
and would admit the article ال, and would not<br>\
have إِنَّ for a corroborative, nor have لَا opposed<br>\
to it, as it has in the saying,<br>\
إِذَا تَقُولُ لَا ابْنَةُ العُجَيْرِ<br>\
تَصْدُقُ لَا إِذَا تَقُولُ جَيْرِ<br>\
[When the daughter of El-&#39;Ojeyr says لا, she<br>\
speaks truly: not when she says جير]: (Mughnee:) or it is a verbal noun, meaning I know;<br>\
syn. أَعْرِفُ; as is mentioned by Ibn-Abi-r-Rabeea,<br>\
and by Er-Radee on the authority of &#39;Abd-El-<br>\
Káhir. (MF.) You say, جَيْرِ لَا آتِيكَ Verily, or<br>\
truly, [&amp;c.,] I will not come to thee. (S.) And<br>\
جَيْرِ لَا أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ Verily, or truly, [&amp;c.,] I will<br>\
not do that. (K, * TA.) And لَا جَيْرِ لَا أَفْعَلُ No,<br>\
verily, or truly, [&amp;c.,] I will not do [that]. (K.)<br>\
جِيرٌ Gypsum; syn. جِصٌّ. (IAar, TA.) [In<br>\
modern Arabic, Lime: see also what next follows.]<br>\
جَيَّارٌ Quick lime, and the mixtures thereof, with<br>\
which are plastered watering-troughs or tanks,<br>\
and baths; syn. صَارُوجٌ: (S, K:) quick lime and<br>\
gypsum mixed with ashes: (IAar TA:) or quick<br>\
lime alone. (TA. [See also جِيرٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  [A limeburner: so in the present day: see أَتُونٌ.]<br>\
-A3-<br>\
Heat in the chest, by reason of rage or hunger;<br>\
as also ↓ جَائِرٌ: (S, K:) or cough, or the like.<br>\
(Ham p. 56.) It is app. of the measure فَعَّالٌ; or<br>\
it may be of the measure فَيْعَالٌ; or فَوْعَالٌ [originally جَوْيَارٌ]. (IJ, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Strength, or vehemence. (TA.)<br>\
جَائِرٌ: see جَيَّارٌ.<br>\

or made deep: or plastered with gypsum. (K.)<br>\
