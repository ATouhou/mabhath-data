which are evident mistranscriptions, or, accord.<br>\
to the &#39;Ináyeh of El-Khafájee, جَرِبَّانٌ, which is<br>\
more strange, (MF,) but this last accords [most<br>\
nearly] with its original, (TA,) [for it is] a<br>\
Persian word arabicized, (S, TA,) originally<br>\
گَرِيبَانْ; (TA;) The جَيْب [or opening at the<br>\

جَرِيبٌ A certain measure, (M, A, Mgh, K,)<br>\
or quantity, of wheat, (S, Msb,) consisting of<br>\
four أَقْفِزَة [pl. of قَفِيزٌ]: (M, A, Msb, K:) or<br>\
ten اقفزة; each قفيز thereof consisting of ten أَعْشِرَآء<br>\
[pl. of عَشِيرٌ]; so that the عشير is the hundredth<br>\
part of the whole: (TA:) or, as some say, a<br>\
measure differing in different countries; as is<br>\
the case of the رطْل and مُدّ and ذِرَاع &amp;c. (MF,<br>\

-b2-  Hence,<br>\
(Mgh,) (assumed tropical:)  A certain quantity of land; (S, Mgh,<br>\

seed so called; (A, Mgh;) like as mules and the<br>\
space that they travel are termed بَرِيدٌ: (A,<br>\
Mgh: *) it is sixty cubits by sixty cubits; accord.<br>\
to Kudámeh, the extent termed أَشْل multiplied<br>\
by itself; the اشل being sixty cubits; the cubit<br>\
being six قَبَضَات; and the قَبْضَة, four أَصَابِع:<br>\
the tenth part of the جريب is called قفيز, and the<br>\
tenth of the قفيز is called عشير; so that the قفيز is<br>\
ten اعشراء: (Mgh:) it is a distinct portion of land,<br>\
differing according to the different conventional<br>\
usages of the people of different provinces: it is<br>\
said that the width of six moderate-sized barleycorns is called إِصْبَعٌ; the قبضة is four اصابع;<br>\
the ذِرَاع is six قبضات; ten أَذْرُع are called قَصَبَةٌ;<br>\
ten قَصَبَات are called اشل; and the جريب is the<br>\
extent termed اشل multiplied by itself: the اشل<br>\
multiplied by the قصبة is called قفيز; and the<br>\
اشل multiplied by the ذراع is called عشير: so the<br>\
جِريب is ten thousand cubits: or, accord. to<br>\
Kudámeh the Scribe, it is three thousand and<br>\
six hundred cubits: (Msb:) pl. [of pauc.] أَجْرِبَةٌ<br>\
and [of mult.] جُرْبَانٌ (S, Msb, K) and جُرُوبٌ.<br>\
(R, TA.) See also جِرْبَةٌ. ―<br>\

absolute sense; and, with the article ال, the name<br>\

(TA:) pl. أَجْرِبَةٌ. (Lth, TA.)<br>\
جَوْرَبٌ [A sock or stocking, or a pair of socks<br>\
or stockings;] the wrapper of the foot or leg:<br>\
(K:) or a pair of woollen envelopes for the feet,<br>\
used for warmth: (TA:) an arabicized word,<br>\
(S, Msb,) from the Persian گُورَبْ, originally<br>\
گُورْ, i. e. “tomb of the foot:” (TA:) pl.<br>\
جَوَارِبَةٌ and جَوَارِبُ; (S, A, Msb, K;) in the<br>\
former of which, the ة is added because it is originally a foreign word. (S, TA.) You say, هُوَ<br>\
أَنْتَنُ مِنْ رِيحِ الجَوْرَبِ [He, or it, is more stinking than the smell of socks, or stockings]. (A, TA.)<br>\
جَوَارِبِىٌّ A maker of جَوَارِب [i. e. socks or stockings]. (TA.)<br>\
أجْرَبُ (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ جَرِبٌ (A,<br>\
Mgh, K) and ↓ جَرْبَانُ or جَرْبَانٌ (K accord. to<br>\
different copies) [Mangy, or scabby;] affected<br>\
with what is termed جَرَب: (S, A, Msb, K:) applied to a camel, (A, Msb,) and to a man: (S,<br>\
A:) fem. (of the first, Msb) جَرْبَآءُ (A, Msb) and<br>\
[of the second] جَرِبَةٌ: (A:) pl. (of the first, S,<br>\
Msb) جُرْبٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and (of the first, S,<br>\
Mgh, TA, or of the second, Mgh, or of the third<br>\
agreeably with analogy, TA) جَرْبَى (S, Mgh, K)<br>\
and [of the first] أَجَارِبُ, which is like certain pls.<br>\
of substantives, as أَجَادِلُ and أَنَامِلُ, (TA,) and<br>\
(of the first contrary to rule, like عِجَافٌ and بِطَاحٌ<br>\
and عِصَالٌ which are pls. of أَعْجَفُ and أَبْطَحُ and<br>\
أَعْصَلُ, Msb, or of the second, IB, K, or of جُرْبٌ,<br>\
which is pl. of the first, S) جِرَابٌ: (S, IB, Msb,<br>\
K:) this last occurs in the following verse [of<br>\
‘Amr, or’ Omeyr, Ibn-El-Hobáb, or El-Khabbáb;<br>\
these variations being in different copies of the<br>\
K; but in the TA art. نشر, and in a copy of the<br>\
S in that art. and in the present one, ‘Omeyr Ibn-El-Khabbáb]:<br>\
وَفِينَا وَإِنْ قِيلَ اصْطَلَحْنَا تَضَاغُنٌ<br>\
كَمَا طَرَّ أَوْبَارُ الجِرَابِ عَلَى النَّشْرِ<br>\
(S, K *) Within us, though it be said that we have<br>\
made peace, one with another, and we are on<br>\
good terms outwardly, is mutual rancour: as the<br>\
soft wool of the mangy camels (while disease lurks<br>\
beneath, within them, TA) grows by reason of<br>\
[eating] the نشر [or herbage] that becomes green<br>\
at the and of summer (in consequence of rain<br>\
falling upon it, TA) and is injurious to animals<br>\
that pasture upon it: (K, TA:) and it is said by<br>\
IB, and in the K, that جراب, here, is pl. of<br>\
جَرِبٌ, not, as J says, of جُرْبٌ: but MF observes<br>\
that فِعَالٌ is the pl. measure of several words of<br>\
the measure فُعْلٌ, as رُمْحٌ and دُهْنٌ, and is even<br>\
said by IHsh and Ibn-Málik and AHei to be<br>\
regularly applicable to sings. of this latter measure; whereas no grammarian nor Arabic scholar<br>\
asserts that a word of the measure فَعِلٌ assumes<br>\
فِعَالٌ as the measure of its pl. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
سَيْفٌ أَجْرَبُ (tropical:)  A sword reddened by much rust,<br>\
which cannot be removed from it unless with a<br>\
file. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And أَرْضٌ جَرْبَآءُ (tropical:)  Land affected<br>\
with. drought: (S, A, Msb, K: *) or salt land,<br>\
affected with drought, and containing nothing.<br>\
(ISd, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And الجَرْبَآءُ (tropical:)  The sky; (S, M, A,<br>\
K;) so called because of the stars (S, TA) and<br>\
the milky way, (TA,) as though it were scabbed<br>\
with stars; (S, IF, ISd;) its stars being likened<br>\
to the marks of جَرَب; (A;) like as the sea is<br>\
called أَجْرَدُ, and like as the sky is also called رَقِيع<br>\
because [as it were] patched with stars: (AAF,<br>\
ISd:) or that tract of the sky in which the sun<br>\
and moon revolve: (M, K:) or the lowest heaven:<br>\
(AHeyth, TA:) and accord. to the M, جربة [so<br>\
in the TA, app. ↓ جَرِبَةُ,] is applied as a determinate [proper] name to the sky. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
جَرْبَآءُ (assumed tropical:)  A beautiful girl; (IAar, K;) so called<br>\
because the women separate themselves from her,<br>\
seeing that their goodly qualities are rendered<br>\
foul by comparison with hers. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
تَجْرِبَةٌ is a subst. from جَرَّبَ: (Msb:) or it is<br>\
an inf. n. of that verb, (M, A, K,) and is one of<br>\
the inf. ns. from which pls. are formed: (M, TA:)<br>\
its pl. is تَجَاربُ (M, Msb, TA) and تَجَارِيبُ,<br>\
(M, TA.) En-Nábighah says,<br>\
إِلَى اليَوْمِ قَدْ جُرِّبْنَ كُلَّ التَّجَارِبِ<br>\
[To this day, they (referring to females) have been<br>\
tried with every kind of tryings]: and El-Aashà<br>\
says,<br>\
كَمْ جَرَّبُوهُ فَمَا زَادَتْ تَجَارِبُهُمْ<br>\
أَبَا قُدَامَةَ إِلَّا المَجْدَ وَالقَنَعَا<br>\
[How often have they tried him, and their tryings<br>\
of Aboo-Kudámeh have not increased aught save<br>\
his glory and contentment!]; تجارب being here<br>\
a pluralized inf. n. made to govern an objective<br>\
complement; which is a strange fact. (M, TA.)<br>\
[But in this latter instance, we may consider<br>\
ابا قدامة as a first objective complement of رادت,<br>\
and شَيْئَا, understood before الّا, as a second objective complement of the same verb.]<br>\
مُجْرِبٌ A man who has his camels affected with<br>\
what is termed جَرَب [i. e. the mange, or scab]:<br>\
whence the prov., لَا إِلَاهَ لِمُجْرِبٍ [There is no god<br>\
to one who has his camels affected with the<br>\
mange]; as though he renounced his god by<br>\
frequently swearing falsely by him that he had<br>\
no pitch when it was demanded of him [for the<br>\
purpose of curing other camels]: (A:) or لَا أَلِيَّةَ<br>\
لِمْجْرِبٍ [There is no oath to one who has his<br>\
camels affected with the mange; for the reason<br>\
above mentioned, or because he is likely to deny<br>\
that he has mangy camels lest his camels should<br>\
be prevented from coming to water: and hence<br>\
also,] أَكْدَبُ مِنْ مُجْرِبٍ [More lying than one<br>\
who has his camels affected with the mange];<br>\
another prov. (Meyd. [See Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov., ii. 382.])<br>\
مُجَرَّبٌ One who has been tried, or proved, in<br>\
affairs, and whose qualities have become known:<br>\
(T, TA:) or one who has been tried, or proved,<br>\
and strengthened by experience in affairs: (S:)<br>\
[experienced, or expert, in affairs:] or one whose<br>\
qualities have been tried, or proved. (K, TA.)<br>\
And ↓ مُجَرِّبٌ One having experience in affairs.<br>\
(K, TA.) In general, but not always, (MF,) the<br>\
Arabs used the former of these two epithets<br>\
[which are virtually synonymous]. (S, MF.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
دَرَاهِمُ مُجَرَّبَةٌ Weighed money. (Kr, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  المُجَرَّبُ<br>\
The lion. (Sgh, K.)<br>\
-A2-  [It is also employed as<br>\
an inf. n. of 2, in accordance with a usage of<br>\
which there are many other instances; as in the<br>\
saying,] أَنْتَ عَلَى المُجَرَّبِ [Thou art about to<br>\
have the proof, or experience]: a prov., mentioned by AZ: said to him who asks respecting a<br>\
thing which he is about to know of himself:<br>\
originally said by a woman to a man who asked<br>\
her an indecent question which he was himself<br>\
about to resolve. (TA.)<br>\
