[xvii. 5], (TA,) inf. n. as above, (S, A, K,) They<br>\
went through the midst of the houses (تَخَلَّلُوهَا),<br>\
and sought for what was in them, as a man seeks<br>\
for news, or tidings; as also ↓ اجتاسوا: (S:) or<br>\
they went to and fro among the houses, in a<br>\
sudden attack: (A, K:) or the meaning in the<br>\
Kur is, they slew you amid your houses; and<br>\

(Fr, TA:) and, inf. n. as above, (K,) and جَوَسَانٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) they went round about (Zj, S, A, K) by<br>\
night, (S,) among the houses, (Zj, A, K,) looking<br>\

-b3-  جِيسَ also signifies It (anything) was trodden: جَوْسٌ is said<br>\
to be like دَوْسٌ: (TA:) and you say, جَآءَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
يَجُوسُ النَّاسَ Such a one came stepping over the<br>\
people; syn. يَتَخَطَّاهُمْ. (A, TA. *) And accord.<br>\

into it, and trod it; (خَالَطْتُهُ وَوَطِئْتُهُ;) meaning,<br>\
any place. (TA.) You say also, جَاسَهُمُ الأَسَدُ<br>\
The lion trod upon them: or came into the midst<br>\
of them, and did mischief among them. (TA;<br>\
[in which the inf. n. of the verb in this sense is<br>\
said to be جَوْسٌ and جَوْسَآءُ: but the latter is<br>\
probably a mistranscription for جَوَسَانٌُ.])<br>\

جَوَّاسٌ One who treads upon everything: or<br>\
who comes into the midst of a people, and does<br>\

The lion. (K, TA.) And in like manner it is<br>\
applied to a man. (TA.)<br>\
