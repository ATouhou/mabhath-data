جَفَا, (K,) aor.<br>\
جَفُوَ, (TA,) inf. n. جَفَآءٌ; and<br>\
↓ تجافى; It did not keep, or cleave, to its place.<br>\
(K.) You say, جَفَا جَنْبُهُ عَنِ الفِرَاشِ, (Mgh,)<br>\
and عَنْهُ ↓ تجافى, (S, Mgh,) His side did not<br>\
rest, or was restless, or uneasy, upon the bed; or<br>\
shrank from it; (S, Mgh;) and heaved, or rose,<br>\
from it: (Mgh:) or the former, his side did not<br>\
keep, or cleave, to its place upon the bed: and the<br>\
latter, it became withdrawn, or removed, from it.<br>\
(TA.) And جَفَا السَّرْجُ عَنْ ظَهْرِ الفَرَسِ, (S Msb,<br>\
TA,) aor. and inf. n. as above; (Msb;) and<br>\
↓ تجافى; (S, Msb;) The saddle heaved, or rose,<br>\
from the back of the horse: (S, Msb:) or did<br>\
not keep, or cleave, to its place upon his back.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] it is said in a trad. of &#39;Omar,<br>\
إِنِّى أَجْفُو عَنْ أَشْيَآءَ مِنَ العِلْمِ Verily I recoil,<br>\
shrink, or am averse, from some matters of knowledge, or science, and ignore them, or neglect<br>\
them. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also جَفَا, (Msb, TA,) aor. as<br>\
above, (Msb,) [and so the inf. n.,] said of a<br>\
garment, or piece of cloth, It was thick, coarse,<br>\
or rough: (Msb, TA:) and in like manner said<br>\
of a reed-pen, it was thick, coarse, or rough, in<br>\
its nib. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And hence, (see جَفَآءٌ, below,<br>\
and جَافٍ,) He was, or became, thick, gross,<br>\
coarse, rough, or rude, of make: and, more commonly, coarse, rough, or rude, of nature or disposition, or in his intercourse and dealings with<br>\
others; unkind, hard, churlish, uncivil, or surly.<br>\
(See also 10.)] It is said in a trad., مَنْ بَدَا جَفَا,<br>\
i. e. [He who abides in the desert] becomes coarse,<br>\
rough, or rude, of nature or disposition; [or unkind, hard, churlish, &amp;c.;] by reason of mixing<br>\
little with men. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  جَفَا عَلَيْهِ كَذَا Such a<br>\
thing was, or became, heavy, onerous, burdensome,<br>\
or oppressive, to him. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  جَفَا جَنْبَهُ عَنِ<br>\
الفِرَاشِ: and جَفَا السَّرْجَ: see 3. ―<br>\
-b2-  جَفَتِ القِدْرُ<br>\
زَبَدَهَا The cooking-pot cast forth its froth, or<br>\
foam; as also ↓ اجفت; (TA;) [like جَفَأَت and<br>\
اجفأت;] originally without ء. (Er- Rághib, TA.)<br>\
And جَفَا السَّيْلُ The torrent drove away [things<br>\
in its course]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  جَفَا الرَّجُلَ, aor. as above,<br>\
He turned away from the man; avoided him;<br>\
or shunned him: or he drove away the man;<br>\
from جفا السَّيْلُ, explained above: sometimes<br>\
meaning, with hatred. (Msb.) And جَفَاهُ He<br>\
withdrew, or removed, far, or to a distance, from<br>\
him: whence the saying of Mohammad Ibn-Sookah, لَمَّا قَلَّ مَالِى جَفَانِى إِخْوَانِى [When my<br>\
property became little, my brethren withdrew far<br>\
from me]. (TA) ―<br>\
-b4-  And جَفَا مَالَهُ He did not<br>\
keep, or cleave, or hold fast, to his property.<br>\

-b5-  And جَفَاهُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
جَفُوَ, (S,) inf. n.<br>\
جَفَآءٌ (S, K) and جَفْوٌ, (K,) He treated him, or<br>\
behaved towards him, coarsely, roughly, rudely,<br>\
unkindly, hardly, churlishly, uncivilly, or surlily:<br>\
(S, K:) you should not say جَفَيْتُ. (S.) The<br>\
pass. part. n. is ↓ مَجْفُوٌّ and ↓ مَجْفِىٌّ: (S, and K<br>\
in art. جفى:) the latter formed in accordance<br>\
with جُفِىَ, in which the و is changed into ى.<br>\
(Fr, S.) ―<br>\
-b6-  He did to him what displeased, grieved,<br>\
or vexed, him; did to him what he disliked, or<br>\
hated; did evil to him. (TA.) So in the trad.,<br>\
مَنْ حَجَّ وَلَمْ يَزُرْنِى فَقَدْ جَفَا [He who performs<br>\
the pilgrimage to Mekkeh and does not visit me,<br>\
i.e. does not visit my tomb afterwards, either on<br>\
his homeward journey or by journeying to ElMedeeneh for that special purpose, does what<br>\
displeases me]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  جَفَتِ المَرْأُةُ وَلَدَهَا The<br>\
woman neglected to take care of her child, or to<br>\
pay frequent attention to it. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
تَجْفِيَةٌ [inf. n. of جفّى] signifies, in Persian,<br>\
جفاء فرمودن [app. as meaning The ordering one<br>\
to act, or to treat another, coarsely, roughly,<br>\
rudely, &amp;c.]. (KL. [Accord. to Golius, as on<br>\
this authority, “i. q. جَفَا, sign. injuria affecit;<br>\
duriter et inique tractavit: seu transit. ejus. ”])<br>\
3<br>\
جافى جَنْبَهُ عَنِ الفِرَاشِ, and ↓ جَفَاهُ, He<br>\
caused his side not to rest, or caused it to be<br>\
restless, or uneasy, upon the bed; or caused it to<br>\
shrink therefrom: and he heaved it, drew it up,<br>\
or raised it, [making it to be separated by some<br>\
space or interval] from the bed. (Mgh.) And<br>\
hence, (Mgh,) جافى عَضُدَيْهِ (Mgh, TA) عَنْ جَنْبيْهِ<br>\
(TA) He put, or set, his upper arms apart, or<br>\
remote, from his sides. (Mgh, TA.) [Thus the<br>\
Muslim is enjoined to do in prostrating himself in<br>\
prayer.] And جافى السَّرْجَ عَنْ ظَهْرِ الفَرَسِ, (S, *<br>\
Msb,) and ↓ اجفاهُ, (S, K,) and ↓ جَفَاهُ, (K, [said<br>\
in the TA to be a mistake, but a similar usage<br>\
of this verb has been mentioned above on the<br>\
authority of the Mgh,]) He raised the saddle<br>\
from the back of the horse: (S, Msb, K:) and<br>\
in like manner, القَتَبَ عَنْ ظَهْرِ البَعِيرِ ↓ أَجْفَيْتُ [I<br>\
raised the saddle from the back of the. camel].<br>\
(M, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اجفاهُ He made, or caused, him, or it, to be,<br>\
or become, distant, remote, far off, or aloof.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 3, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  اجفى<br>\
المَاشِيَةَ He fatigued the cattle, [in some copies of<br>\
the S, تَبِعَهَا is put for أَتْعَبَهَا,] and did not let them<br>\
eat, (AZ, S, K, TA,) nor fed them previously,<br>\
driving them vehemently. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  أَجْفَتِ القِدْرُ:<br>\
see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  أجْفَتِ الأَرْضُ The land became like the<br>\
جُفَآء, or rubbish and scum cast forth by the<br>\
torrent of a valley, or by a cooking-pot, in<br>\
respect of the departure of the good thereof. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تجافى: see 1, in three places. [Said of a<br>\
person prostrating himself, or lying down, it<br>\
means He drew up his body from that on which<br>\
he rested. And تجافى عَنْهُ generally signifies<br>\
He, or it, receded, withdrew, removed, or became<br>\
remote or aloof or separated by some space or<br>\
interval, from him, or it: and he drew away,<br>\
shrank, or flinched, from him, or it.] It is said,<br>\
of the difference between الذَّبْح and القَتْل, that<br>\
the former is by cutting the external jugular<br>\
veins; and the latter, بِإِيقَاعِ الفِعِلِ فِى المَحَلِّ مَعَ<br>\
التَّجَافِى [By causing the act to take effect upon<br>\
the place thereof while standing aloof]; meaning<br>\
that the قَاتِل strikes from a distance, not knowing<br>\
whether he will hit the place or not. (Mgh.)<br>\
And [hence] you say, تجافى لَهُ عَنْ حَقِّهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He<br>\
relinquished, i. e.] he gave, to him, his right, or<br>\
due. (TA in art. خمص.) ―<br>\

he should do what was displeasing, grievous,<br>\
vexatious, or evil. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  استجفى He became<br>\

or behaviour. (TA.) ―<br>\

جَفَآءٌ is in make; [signifying Thickness, grossness, coarseness, roughness, or rudeness:] and in<br>\

(S,) or of صِلَةٌ; (K;) as also ↓ جَفًا, (K,) accord.<br>\
to Lth; but Az says that he knew not any one<br>\
who allowed this latter: (TA:) so, too, ↓ جِفْوَةٌ<br>\

him is coarseness, roughness, or rudeness, &amp;c.] :<br>\
(K:) and فُلَانٌ ظَاهِرُ الجِفْوَةِ Such a one is a<br>\

&amp;c., is apparent: (S:) but accord. to Lth, جفوة<br>\
[whether جَفْوَةٌ or جَفْوَةٌ is not shown] denotes a<br>\
more constant quality than جَفَآءٌ (TA.) You<br>\
say also, ↓ بِهِ جَفْوَةٌ, meaning He is suffering<br>\
