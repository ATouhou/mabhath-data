And جَفَأَتِ القِدْرُ, and ↓ اجفأت, The cooking-pot<br>\
cast forth its froth, or foam, (S, K,) in boiling:<br>\
(S:) or جفأت بِزَبَدِهَا it cast forth its froth, or<br>\

occurring in a trad., is explained by IAth as<br>\
meaning The first, or foremost, of the men or<br>\
people (سَرَعَانُهُمْ): but Bkh and Muslim read<br>\
(instead of جفاء) أَخِفَّآءُ, pl. of خَفِيفٌ. (TA.)<br>\
