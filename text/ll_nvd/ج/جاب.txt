جَأَبَ, aor.<br>\
جَاَ^َ, (S, K,) inf. n. جَأْبٌ, (S,) He<br>\
gained, earned, or acquired, (S, K,) wealth, or<br>\
property: (K:) but [SM says,] I have not seen<br>\
that any of the leading lexicologists has mentioned this addition of wealth, or property. (TA.<br>\
[See, however, جَأّبٌ, below.]) The rájiz (Ru-beh<br>\
Ibn-El-&#39;Ajjáj, TA) says,<br>\
وَاللّٰهُ رَاعِى عَمَلِى وَجَأْبِى<br>\
[And God is mindful of my work and my earning]. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also He sold جَأْبِ, i. e. مَغْرَة<br>\
[red ochre]; (IAar, K;) and so جَبَأَ. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
جَأْبٌ Thick, gross, big, or bulky: (S, K:) or<br>\
strong: (A:) applied to an ass, (A, K,) or to a<br>\
wild ass: (S, K:) as also جَابٌ, without ء: (S:)<br>\
pl. جُؤُوبٌ. (TA.) Accord. to the K [and the<br>\
A], it signifies also Whatever is rude, or coarse;<br>\
thick, gross, big, or bulky: (كُلُّ جَافٍ غَلِيظٍ:)<br>\
but in the L, we find كَاهِلٌ جَأْبٌ غَلِيظٌ [meaning<br>\
that جَأْبٌ applied to the part of the back termed<br>\
كاهل signifies thick, or big]: and خَلْقٌ جَأْبٌ<br>\
as meaning a thick, gross, big, or bulky, make.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] الجَأْبُ The lion. (A, Sgh,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And جَأْبَةُ المِدْرَى, (S, A, K,) or, accord. to<br>\
AO (S) and the Mj (TA) and Sh, (TA in art.<br>\
جوب q. v.,) without ء, (S, TA,) A doe-gazelle<br>\
having her horn just come forth; because the<br>\
horn when it first comes forth is thick, and afterwards becomes slender; (S, K;) thus showing<br>\
her to be young: (S:) or a doe-gazelle, and a<br>\
cow, strong in the horn. (A.) [See also art.<br>\
جوب.] ―<br>\
-b4-  You say also, فُلَانٌ شَخْتُ الآلِ جَأْبُ<br>\
الصَّبْرِ (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is slender in body, or person,<br>\
[but] great in patience. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  The navel. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  Red ochre; syn. مَغْرَة [read by Golius معزة];<br>\
(Mj, K;) with and without ء, (Mj, TA.)<br>\
جَأْبَةُ البَطْنِ, (Ibn-Buzurj, K,) as also جَبْأَةُ<br>\

navel and the pubes. (TA.)<br>\
جُؤْبَةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
جُؤُوبَةٌ (K) and ↓ جُؤْبَةٌ (K accord. to some copies,<br>\
but not in others nor in the TA) A grinning, and<br>\
frowning, or contracting, of the face; or looking<br>\
sternly, austerely, or morosely. (K.)<br>\
جَأّبٌ A gainer, an earner, or an acquirer, of<br>\
wealth, or property. (TA voce جَوَّابٌ.)<br>\
