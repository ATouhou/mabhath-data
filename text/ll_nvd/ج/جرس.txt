جَرَسَ, [aor., app.,<br>\

implied in the K, inf. n. جَرْسٌ, which see below,]<br>\
He, or it, made a sound; (TA;) as also ↓ اجرس:<br>\
(Mgh, TA:) [or both signify he, or it, made a<br>\
low, gentle, slight, or soft, sound; as appears<br>\
from what follows.] You say, جَرَسَ بِالكَلَامِ, (A,)<br>\
or جَرَسَ الكَلَامَ, (Msb,) He spoke in a low, gentle,<br>\
or soft, voice or tone; or with modulation, or<br>\

or with modulation or melody; expl. by تَكَلَّمَ<br>\
بِشَىْءٍ وَتَنَغَّمَ. (Lth, S.) And ↓ اجرس is also used<br>\
in the senses here following. It (a bird) caused<br>\
the sound of its passing to be heard: (S, A, * K:)<br>\
and in like manner it is said of a man. (K,<br>\
accord. to the TA; but not found by me in any<br>\
copy of the K.) ↓ And (tropical:)  It (an ornament, حَلْىٌ,)<br>\
made a sound (S, A, * K) like that of a جَرَس [or<br>\
bell]; (TA;) as also ↓ انجرس. (A, TA.) ↓ And<br>\
It (a tribe, حَىٌّ,) made its sound (جَرْس) to be<br>\
heard: or, accord. to the T, made the sound of<br>\
the جَرْس of a thing to be heard. (TA.) ↓ And<br>\
He (a man) raised his voice. (TA.) ↓ And He<br>\
(a camel-driver) sang to camels for the purpose of urging or exciting: (S, K:) or raised his<br>\
voice in doing so. (A.) ―<br>\

جَرِسَ, (K,) inf. n. جَرْسٌ,<br>\
(Lth, AO, K,) He ate [a thing: because a slight<br>\
sound is made in doing so]: (AO, TA:) or he<br>\
licked [a thing] with his tongue. (K.) You say,<br>\
جَرَسَت النَّحْلُ العُرْفُطَ The bees ate the [trees called]<br>\
عرفط: (S) and جَرَسَتِ النَّوْرَ, (Lth, A,) and العَسَلَ<br>\
[put tropically for النَّوْرَ because honey is made<br>\
from flowers or blossoms], (Lth, TA,) the bees<br>\
ate the flowers, or blossoms, making a sound in so<br>\
doing: (A:) or licked the flowers, or blossoms,<br>\
and thence made honey. (Lth, TA.) And جَرَسَتِ<br>\
المَاشِيَةُ الشَّجَرَ, and العُشْبَ, The beasts licked the<br>\
trees, and the herbage. (TA.) And جَرَسَتِ البَقَرَةُ<br>\

rendered him experienced, or expert, and sound,<br>\
or firm, in judgment &amp;c. (S, K, * TA)<br>\
4<br>\
اجرس: see 1, in six places. ―<br>\
-b2-  اجرس بِالحَلْىِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [He made a sound with the ornament]: said of<br>\
the owner [or wearer] of the ornament. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
اجرس الجَرَسَ He struck [or sounded] the bell.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  أَجْرَسَنِى السَّبُعُ The animal of prey<br>\

جَرْسٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ جِرْسٌ (S, A, K)<br>\
and ↓ جَرَسٌ (Kr, ISd) A sound: (ISk, A, K:)<br>\
or a low, faint, gentle, slight, or soft, sound:<br>\
(IDrd, S A, K:) such, for instance, as the sound<br>\
of the beaks of birds, (S, A, Msb,) pecking, (A,)<br>\
upon a thing which they are eating: (S:) and that<br>\
of bees eating flowers or blossoms: (A:) and of<br>\
a tribe [or crowd of men, more particularly as<br>\
heard from some distance; i. e., a hum]: (TA:)<br>\
and of a camel-driver singing to his beasts to<br>\
urge or excite them: (A:) and the slight sound<br>\
of a letter of the alphabet: (TA:) and low,<br>\
gentle, or soft, speech: (Msb:) or when the<br>\
word is used alone, [i. e., not coupled with<br>\
another noun as it is in the second of the two<br>\
examples here following,] it is with fet-h: thus<br>\
one says, مَا سَمِعْتُ لَهُ جَرْسًا; (A, K;) i. e., I<br>\
heard not any sound of him, or it: (TA:) but<br>\
you say, ↓ مَا سَمِعْتُ لَهُ حِسًّا وَلَا جِرْسًا, with kesr;<br>\
(A, K;) i. e., I heard not any motion, nor any<br>\

جَرَسٌ [A bell;] a thing well known; (Msb;)<br>\
the thing that is hung to the neck of the camel<br>\
(S, Mgh, K) &amp;c., and that makes a sound:<br>\
(Mgh:) or, accord. to some, the [little round<br>\
bell called] جُلْجُل: (TA:) and also that which<br>\
is struck [to make it sound]: (Lth, S, K:) the<br>\
thing that is struck by the Christians at the times<br>\
of prayers: (Har p. 616:) pl. أجْرَاسٌ. (Mgh,<br>\
Msb.) It is said in a trad., لَا تَصْحَبُ المَلَائِكَةُ<br>\
رُفْقَةً فِيهَا جَرَسٌ [The angels will not accompany an<br>\
assemblage of persons journeying together among<br>\
whom is a bell]: (S, TA:) the reason is said to<br>\
be, because it guides others to them; for Mo-<br>\
hammad liked not to let the enemy know of his<br>\
approach until he came upon them suddenly.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also جَرْسٌ.<br>\
جُرْسَةٌ The act of rendering [a person or persons]<br>\

and TA in art. دخل:) or a well-known grain,<br>\
which is eaten, like دُخْن, of which there are<br>\
three species, the best whereof is the yellow<br>\
[الصفر, or the word may be الاصغر, the smallest,]<br>\
and weighty: it is likened to rice in its power,<br>\
or virtue, is more astringent than دُخْن, promotes<br>\
the flow of urine, and constringes: the word is<br>\
arabicized, from [the Persian] گَاوِرْسْ. (TA.)<br>\
مُجَرَّسٌ (S) and مُجَرِّسٌ (TA) (tropical:)  A man (TA)<br>\
experienced, or expert, in affairs, (S, TA,) and<br>\
rendered sound, or firm, in judgment &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
