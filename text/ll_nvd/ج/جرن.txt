جِرْنٌ The body, with the limbs or members;<br>\
syn. جِسْمٌ; said to be a dial. var. of جِرْمٌ; or<br>\
the ن may be a substitute for the جرم of أَجْرَانٌ; but<br>\

case when a word is formed by substitution.<br>\
(TA.) Hence the saying, أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ أَجْرَانَهُ, i. q.<br>\
القى عليه أَجْرَامَهُ and شَرَاشِرَهُ [He threw upon<br>\
him, or it, the weight of his body]: (Lh, TA:<br>\
