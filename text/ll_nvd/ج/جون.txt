tinged with red] at setting; (S;) or it may be<br>\
because of its whiteness and clearness; but it is<br>\
said to be only applied to the sun when it is<br>\
setting; opposed to غَزَالَةٌ; as observed by MF:<br>\
(TA:) [see also جَوْنٌ:] the sun is also called<br>\
↓ جَوْنَآءُ, (K,) because of its becoming black [or of<br>\
a blackish colour tinged with red] at setting.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A [jar such as is called] خَابِيَة: (IAar,<br>\

the sun, also, the quality denoted by جَوْنَةٌ [as<br>\
fem. of جَوْنٌ, q. v.]: and blackness; as in the<br>\
saying, لَا أَفْعَلُهُ حَتَّى تَبْيَضَّ جُونَةُ القَارِ [I will not<br>\
do it until the blackness of pitch, or tar, become<br>\

كُدْرِىٌّ; and the other, غَطَاطٌ; and the former<br>\
is dusky, or dingy, or of a hue inclining to black<br>\
and dust-colour, (أَكْدَر,) in the back, black in<br>\
the inner side of the wing, yellow in the throat,<br>\
short in the legs, having in the tail two feathers<br>\

كُدْرِىٌّ: the جونىّ is described by De Sacy, on<br>\
the authority of the book entitled درّة المنتقاة من<br>\
عجائب المخلوقات وغرائب الموجودات, thus: “ le<br>\
djouni a les barbes internes des ailes et les pennes<br>\
primaires noires; il a la gorge blanche, ornée de<br>\
deux colliers, l&#39;un jaune et l&#39;autre noir; son dos<br>\
est d&#39;un gris cendré, moucheté, mêlé d&#39;un peu de<br>\
jaune: on appelle cette espèce djouni, parce que<br>\
sa voix ne rend pas un son clair et sonore, mais<br>\
qu&#39;elle fait entendre seulement une sorte de gargouillement dans le gosier: ” (Chrest. Arabe,<br>\
2nd ed., ii. 369:)] it is stated in the handwriting<br>\
of As, on the authority of the Arabs, that جونىّ,<br>\
applied to the قطا, is with ء; app. meaning that it<br>\
was pronounced جُؤُنِىٌّ: (M, TA:) a single bird<br>\
of this species is termed جُونِيَّةٌ: (S:) and you<br>\
say also ↓ قَطَاةٌ جَوْنَةٌ, with fet-h: (TA:) [but<br>\
جُونِىٌّ seems to be also used as a n. un., like<br>\
رُومِىٌّ: for it is said that] جُونٌ is pl. [or rather<br>\
coll. gen. n.] of جُونىٌّ, like as تَمْرٌ is of تَمْرَةٌ.<br>\
