جَدُبَ, (K,) inf. n. جَدْبٌ, (Msb,) He<br>\
found fault with it; dispraised it; expressed disapprobation of it. (S, M, A, Msb, K.) So in the<br>\

(S,) جَدَبَ السَّمَرَ بَعْدَ العِشَآءِ (S) or بَعْدَ العَتَمَةِ (A)<br>\

TA:) or have not met with, or found, anything<br>\
but what was bad, by reason of drought, and barrenness, or dryness of the earth, this year. (A.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَجْدَبَ see 1, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  أَجْدَبَتِ السَّنَةُ The<br>\
year became one of drought, barrenness, or<br>\
dearth; or drought, and dryness of the earth.<br>\
(A, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اجدب القَوْمُ The people, or company of men, experienced drought, barrenness, or<br>\
death; or drought, and dryness of the earth.<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K.) ―<br>\

(tropical:) We alighted as guests at the abode of the sons<br>\
of such a one, and found not entertainment with<br>\
them, though they were in the enjoyment of<br>\
plenty: (A:) [or] نَزَلْنَا فُلَانًا فَأَجَْبْنَاهُ (assumed tropical:) we alighted<br>\
as guests at the abode of such a one, and [found<br>\
that] he did not entertain us. (TA.) [The latter,<br>\
if correct, is from what next follows.]<br>\
-A2-  اجدب<br>\
الأَرْضَ He found the land to be affected with<br>\
drought, barrenness, or dearth; or with drought,<br>\
and dryness of the earth. (S, A, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
مَا أَتَجَدَّبُ أَنْ أَصْحَبَكَ (assumed tropical:) I do not deem it<br>\
disagreeable, or unsuitable, to accompany thee;<br>\
syn. مَا أَسْتَوْخِمُ. (K.)<br>\
جَدْبٌ Drought, barrenness, or dearth; contr.<br>\
of خِصْبٌ; (S;) i. q. مَحْلٌ, (A, Msb, K,) i. e.<br>\
drought, or suspension of rain, and dryness of the<br>\
earth; (Msb;) dryness and barrenness of the<br>\
earth: (Har p. 576:) and ↓ جِدَبٌّ is a name,<br>\
or subst., for الجَدْبٌ, (K, TA,) meaning المَحْلُ;<br>\
as in the saying of the rájiz, cited by Sb,<br>\
لَقَدْ خَشِيتُ أَنْ أَرَى جِدَبَّا<br>\
فِى عَامِنَا بَعْدَ مَا أَخْصَبَّا<br>\
[Verily I feared to see drought, or barrenness,<br>\
&amp;c., in this our year, after it had been abundant<br>\
in herbage]; جِدَبَّا being used for الجَدْبَا; or,<br>\
accord. to one reading, it is ↓ جَدْبَبَّا, with a<br>\
doubled ب added; the change being made for<br>\
the sake of the metre. (M, TA. [Respecting<br>\
أَخْصَبَّا, see 4 in art. خصب.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A place,<br>\
(S, A, K,) or a country, or region, (Msb,) affected<br>\
with drought, barrenness, or dearth; or with<br>\
drought, and dryness of the earth; and so<br>\

↓ مَجْدُوبٌ, (K,) the last derived from جُدِبَ<br>\
though this verb has not been used, (TA,) and<br>\
↓ مُجْدِبٌ, (M, A,) of which the pl. is مَجَادِيبُ.<br>\
(A.) You say also أَرْضٌ جَدْبٌ [in which جدب<br>\
is an inf. n. (though app. obsolete as such) and<br>\
therefore applicable to a fem. subst.] (ISd, TA)<br>\
and جَدْبَةٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ جَدِبَةٌ (A, Msb)<br>\
and ↓ جَدِيبٌ (Msb) and ↓ جَدُوبٌ (Lh, M, Msb)<br>\
and ↓ مُجْدِبَةٌ, of which last the pl. is مَجَادِيبُ,<br>\
(Msb,) A land affected with drought, &amp;c.: (S,<br>\
M, A, &amp;c.:) and أَرْضُونَ جُدُوبٌ, (S, K,) as though<br>\
to each part were applied the term جَدْبٌ [used<br>\
as a subst.] from which is formed the pl. جُدُوبٌ,<br>\
(TA,) and جَدْبٌ, (K,) which is here an inf. n.<br>\
used as an epithet [and therefore applicable to a<br>\
pl. subst.], (TA,) lands affected with drought,<br>\
&amp;c. (S, K.) And ↓ فَلَاةٌ جَدْبَآءُ [fem. of أَجْدَبُ]<br>\
(M, K) A desert affected with drought, &amp;c.;<br>\
(K;) in which is neither little nor much, neither<br>\
pasture nor herbage. (M, TA.) And ↓ فُلَانٌ جَدِيبُ<br>\
الجَنَابِ Such a one is environed by a tract affected<br>\
with drought, &amp;c. (S. [But this phrase is generally used tropically, as meaning (assumed tropical:) Such a one is<br>\
ungenerous or illiberal or inhospitable. See art.<br>\
جنب.]) And سَنَةٌ جَدْبَةٌ (K in art. جرز) and عَامٌ<br>\
↓ جَدُوبٌ (M, TA) [A year of drought, &amp;c.]. See<br>\
also أَجَادِبُ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. عَيْبٌ [A<br>\
vice, fault, defect, &amp;c.]; (S, A, K;) a signification which may be either proper or tropical.<br>\
(Er-Rághib, MF.)<br>\
أَرْضٌ جَدِبَةٌ: see جَدْبٌ.<br>\
أَخَذَ فِى وَادِى جَدَبَاتٍ: see جَذَبَات, in art.<br>\
جذب.<br>\
جِدَبٌّ and جَدْبَبٌّ: see جَدْبٌ.<br>\
جَدُوبٌ: see جَدْبٌ, in three places.<br>\
جَدِيبٌ: see جَدْبٌ, in three places.<br>\
جَادِبٌ Finding fault, dispraising, expressing<br>\
disapprobation: whence the saying of Dhu-rRummeh,<br>\
فَيَا لَكَ مِنْ خَدٍّ أَسِيلٍ و مَنْطِقٍ<br>\
رَخِيمٍ وَمِنْ خَلْقٍ تَعَلَّلَ جَادِبُهْ<br>\
meaning [O thou smooth and even cheek, and<br>\
gentle speech, and make] whereof he who dispraises it occupies himself vainly, finding no<br>\
defect in it. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also said [as in<br>\
the K &amp;c.] to signify Lying; and the author of<br>\
the &#39;Eyn says that it has no verb belonging to it<br>\
[in this sense]; but this is a mistranscription<br>\
[for خَادِبٌ]: AZ says that جَادِبٌ, with ج, has<br>\
the signification here first given. (M, TA.)<br>\
جُنْدَبٌ and جُنْدُبٌ (S, K, &amp;c.) and جِنْدَبٌ,<br>\
like دِرْهَمٌ, (Sb, M, K,) the last of which is of<br>\
weakest authority, because of a rare measure,<br>\
whereof it has been said that there are only four<br>\
examples: (TA:) in all of them the ن is said<br>\
by some to be radical; but others, with more<br>\
reason, hold it to be augmentative: (MF:) Sb<br>\
says that it is augmentative: (S:) A species of<br>\
locust, (S, K,) well known: (K:) or the male<br>\
locust: or small locust: or, accord. to Seer, i. q.<br>\
صَدًى [a kind of cricket], that creaks by night,<br>\
and hops and flies: [but see صَدًى:] or, accord.<br>\
to the M, it is smaller than the صدى, and is<br>\
found in the deserts: pl. جَنَادِبُ. (TA.) صرّ<br>\
الجندب [i. e. صَرَّ الجُنْدَبُ The جندب creaked]<br>\
is a saying of the Arabs, used as a proverb;<br>\
alluding to a difficult affair by which a person<br>\
is troubled in mind; originating from the fact<br>\
that the جندب, when its feet are scorched by the<br>\
heated ground, does not keep them steadily upon<br>\
it, and a creaking sound is consequently heard,<br>\
produced by its legs. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أُمُّ جُنْدَبٍ The<br>\
sand; because the locust [or جندب] deposits<br>\
its eggs therein: and the walker therein falls into<br>\
evil [or encounters difficulty]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence<br>\
it signifies also] Misfortune: (S, M, K:) and<br>\
perfidy, or faithlessness, or treachery: (M, K:)<br>\
and wrong, or injury: (S, M, K:) and evil conduct,<br>\
or ill treatment. (S.) You say, وَقَعَ فُلَانٌ فِى<br>\
أُمِّ جُنْدَبٍ Such a one fell into misfortune: or<br>\
into perfidy. (TA.) And وَقَعُوا فِى أُمِّ جُنْدَبٍ<br>\
They suffered wrong, or injury. (AZ, S, K.)<br>\
And وَقَعَ القَوْمُ جُنْدَبٍ The people, or company<br>\
of men, committed wrong, or injury, and slew<br>\
him who was not a slayer: (TA:) [as though<br>\
they came with violence upon sand in which eggs<br>\
of the جندب were deposited, and so destroyed<br>\
the eggs, which had occasioned them no harm.]<br>\
And رَكِبَ أُمَّ جُنْدَبٍ He committed wrong, or<br>\
injury. (TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
أَجْدَبُ i. q. جَدْبٌ as syn. with جَدِيبٌ: fem.<br>\
جَدْيَآءُ. Hence,] فَلَاةٌ جَدْيَآءُ: see جَدْبٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence<br>\
also,] سَنَةٌ جَدْبَآءُ A year of much snow. (L in<br>\
art. شهب.) ―<br>\
-b3-  أَجْدَبُ is [also] said in the M to<br>\
be [used as] a subst. applied to what is termed<br>\
مُجْدِب [i. e. as syn. with the latter word used<br>\
as an epithet in which the quality of a subst.<br>\
is predominant; app. meaning A place, or the<br>\
like, affected with drought, &amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Also,<br>\
as a comparative and superlative epithet, meaning<br>\
More, and most, affected with drought, &amp;c.;<br>\
contr. of أَخْصَبُ.]<br>\
أَجَادِبُ, in a trad., where it is said, وَكَانَتْ فِيهِ<br>\
أَجَادِبُ أَمْسَكَتِ المَآءِ, (K, * TA,) or وكانت فِيهَا,<br>\
(TA,) [And there were in it اجادب that retained the water], is said to be pl. of أَجْدُبٌ,<br>\
which is pl. of ↓ جَدْبٌ, (K, TA,) like as أَكَالِبُ<br>\
is pl. of أَكْلُبٌ, which is pl. of كَلْبٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and signifies hard parts of the ground, that<br>\
retain water, and do not imbibe it quickly; or,<br>\
as some say, land having no plants or herbage,<br>\
from ↓ جَدْبٌ meaning “ drought ” &amp;c: the word<br>\
is thus written in the two Saheehs, of El-Bukháree and Muslim: (IAth, TA:) but some say<br>\
that it is an anomalous pl. of جَدْبٌ, like as مَحَاسِنُ<br>\
is of حُسْنٌ: and there are other readings; namely,<br>\
أَجَاذِبُ and أَحَادِبُ and أَحَازِبُ and أَجَارِدُ, pl. of<br>\
أَجْرَدُ, and إِخَاذَاتٌ, pl. of إِخَاذَةٌ. (MF, TA.)<br>\
مُجْدِبٌ, and its fem., with ة: see جَدْبٌ.<br>\
مِجْدَابٌ Land scarely ever, or never, abundant in<br>\
herbage, or in the goods, conveniences, or comforts,<br>\
of life; scarcely ever, or never, fruitful, or plentiful. (K.)<br>\
مَجْدُوبٌ: see جَدْبٌ.<br>\
