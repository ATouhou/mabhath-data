جَرَّعَ [جرّعهُ المَآءَ He made him to swallow the<br>\
water.] تَجْرِيعٌ is The pouring beverage into the<br>\
throat against one&#39;s will: but sometimes it is<br>\
used of that which is not against one&#39;s will. (Har<br>\
p. 115.) And جرّعهُ signifies He gave him to<br>\
drink gulp after gulp, or sup after sup, or sip<br>\
after sip. (Har p. 350.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] جرّعهُ<br>\
الغُصَصَ, (K,) or جرّعهُ غُصَصَ الغَيْظِ, (S,) inf. n.<br>\
تَجْرِيعٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  He made him to repress, or restrain, choking wrath, or rage. (S, TA.)<br>\

اجرعهُ He made it (a rope or a bow-string)<br>\
to have one or more of its strands thick [or rather<br>\
thicker than the others]. (TA.)<br>\

تجرّع He swallowed in consecutive portions,<br>\
one time after another, like him who acts against<br>\
his own will: or, as IAth says, he drank in<br>\
haste: or, accord. to some, he drank by little<br>\
and little. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] تجرّع<br>\
(S, Msb, K *) (tropical:)  He repressed, or restrained, choking<br>\

(Msb:) and [in like manner] you say also, ↓ جَرِعَ<br>\

إِجْتَرَعَ see 1.<br>\
جَرَعٌ A twisting in one of the strands of a<br>\
rope, (S, K,) or of a bow-string, (K,) so that<br>\
it appears above the other strands. (S, K.) [It<br>\
is app. an inf. n., of which the verb, if it have<br>\
one, is جَرِعَ.]<br>\
-A2-  See also جَرَعَةٌ.<br>\
جَرِعٌ A rope, (K,) or a bow-string, (TA,)<br>\
having the twisting termed جَرَعٌ in one of its<br>\
strands; as also ↓ مُجَرَّعٌ: (K:) or, accord. to<br>\
IAar, a bow-string that is even, except that there<br>\
is a prominence in one part of it, wherefore it is<br>\
rubbed and pulled with a piece of a كِسَآء [q. v.]<br>\
until that prominence disappears: and ↓ the<br>\
latter, accord. to ISh, a bow-string not uniformly<br>\
nor well twisted, having in it prominences, so<br>\
that one of its strands appears above the others,<br>\
or some appear above others. (TA.)<br>\
جَرْعَةٌ: see what next follows, in three places:<br>\
-A2-  and see جَرَعَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
جُرْعَةٌ A gulp, or as much as is swallowed at once,<br>\
of water; a جُرْعَة of water being like a لُقْمَة of<br>\
food: (Msb:) or a sup, or sip; or as much as<br>\
is supped, or sipped, at once; or a mouthful of<br>\
what is supped, or sipped; (syn. حُسْوَةٌ;) of water;<br>\
(S, K;) as also ↓ جَرْعَةٌ and ↓ جِرْعَةٌ: or جُرْعَةٌ<br>\
and ↓ جَرْعَةٌ are substs. [signifying the act of<br>\
swallowing water] from جَرِعَ المَآءَ “ he swallowed<br>\
the water: ” (K:) or ↓ جَرْعَةٌ signifies a single act<br>\
of swallowing water: (IAth, L:) and جُرْعَةٌ, what<br>\
one swallows: (L, K:) or a mouthful which one<br>\
swallows: (TA:) or a small draught: (IAth:)<br>\
and its pl. is جُرَعٌ. (Msb, TA.) The dim. is<br>\
↓ جُرَيْعَةٌ. (S, K.) And hence the prov., أَفْلَتَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ جُرَيْعَةَ الذَّقَنِ, (Sgh, K,) the verb being<br>\
intrans., and جريعة being in the accus. case as a<br>\
denotative of state, as though the speaker said,<br>\
أَفْلَتَ قَاذِفًا جُرَيْعَةَ الذَّقَنِ; (Sgh;) or بِجُرَيْعَةِ<br>\
الذَّقَنِ; (S, K;) or ↓ بِجُرَيْعَآئِهَا; (K;) Such a one<br>\
escaped [from destruction] when his spirit, or the<br>\
remains thereof, had become in his mouth; (L,<br>\
K;) or near thereto, (K,) as a sup [or little sup] of<br>\
water to the chin [of a person drinking]; (TA;)<br>\
or when death was as near to him as a little sup<br>\
of water to the chin; (L;) or when at his last<br>\
gasp: (Fr, S:) applied to one who has been at<br>\
the point of destruction, and then escaped: (S:)<br>\
or, accord. to AZ, it is thus; أَفْلَتَنِى جُرَيْعَةَ الذَّقَنِ,<br>\
which may mean he made me to escape &amp;c., or<br>\
he escaped from me &amp;c.; in the latter case, افلتنى<br>\
being for أَفْلَتَ مِنِّى; and [it is said that] جريعة<br>\
is prefixed to الذقن because the motion of the<br>\
chin indicates the nearness of the departure of the<br>\
soul: or the meaning of the words related by AZ<br>\
may be, he made me, i. e. the remains of my<br>\
soul, to escape; the last two words being a substitute for the pronoun affixed to the verb.<br>\
(Sgh.) One says also, أَفْلَتَنَىِ جُرَيْعَةَ الرِّيقِ, meaning He outwent me, [or escaped me,] and I swallowed my spittle in wrath, or rage, against him.<br>\
(TA.) And مَا مِنْ جُرْعَةٍ أَحْمَدُ عُقْبَانًا مِنْ جُرْعَةِ<br>\
غَيْظٍ نَكْظِمُهَا (tropical:)  [There is nothing that is swallowed<br>\
more praiseworthy in its result than what is<br>\
swallowed of wrath, or rage, which we repress,<br>\
or restrain]. (TA.)<br>\
جِرْعَةٌ: see جُرْعَةٌ.<br>\
جَرَعَةٌ (S, K) and ↓ جَرْعَةٌ (K) and ↓ جَرْعَآءُ (S,<br>\
K) and ↓ أَجْرَعُ (K) An even piece, (S,) or a<br>\
round piece, or hill, or hillock, (K,) of sand, that<br>\
produces no plants, or herbage; (S, K;) and, as<br>\
some add, that retains no water: (TA:) or a<br>\
piece, or tract, of sand, good for producing plants,<br>\
or herbage, in which is no softness, or looseness:<br>\
(Sgh, L, K:) or land in which is ruggedness,<br>\
resembling sand: (L, K:) or a hill of which one<br>\
side consists of sand, and one side of stones: (K:)<br>\
or what is termed ↓ جرعاء and ↓ اجرع is larger<br>\
than what is termed جَرَعَةٌ: ↓ جرعاء is also explained as signifying sand of which the middle<br>\
is elevated, and of which the sides are thin: and,<br>\
accord. to IAth, ↓ اجرع signifies a wide place, in<br>\
which is ruggedness: (TA:) or this last, a plain,<br>\
or soft, place, intermixed with sand: (Ham<br>\
p. 574:) جَرَعَةٌ is sing., or n. un., of ↓ جَرَعٌ: (S,<br>\
K: *) or, accord. to some, this last word is a<br>\
sing., like اجرع; and its pl. [of pauc.] is أَجْرَاعٌ<br>\
and [of mult.] جِرَاعٌ: the pl. of جَرَعَةٌ is جِرْعَانٌ:<br>\
and the pl. of ↓ جَرْعَةٌ is جِرَاعٌ: and the pl. of ↓ جِرِعاء<br>\
is جَرْعَاوَاتٌ: and the pl. of ↓ اجرع is أَجَارِعُ.<br>\

مُجْرِعٌ A she-camel in which is not as much [milk]<br>\
as will satisfy thirst, but only some sups: (K:)<br>\
pl. مَجَارِيعُ (L, K) and مَجَارِعُ: (L:) J explains<br>\
the former pl. as signifying she-camels having<br>\
little milk; as though there were not in their<br>\
udders more than some sups; and the sing. he<br>\
does not mention. (TA.)<br>\
