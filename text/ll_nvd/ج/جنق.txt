جَنِقَ, (IAar, K,) inf. n. جَنْقٌ;<br>\
(IAar, TA;) and ↓ جنّقوا, inf. n. تَجْنِيقٌ; (AZ,<br>\
K;) They cast stones of [or with] the مَنْجَنِيق:<br>\
(K, * TA:) and ↓ مَجْنَقُوا, (K,) or مَجْنَقُوا مَنْجَنِيقًا<br>\
[app. meaning they constructed a منجنيق], (Lth,<br>\
TA,) is said by such as hold the م to be radical;<br>\
(K;) or it may be that the م is augmentative,<br>\
and that the verb is [denominative,] similar to<br>\
تَمَسْكَنَ from مِسْكِينٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  جَنَقُونَا بِالمَنْجَنِيقِ<br>\
They cast at us with the منجنيق: mentioned by<br>\
El-Fárisee on the authority of AZ. (M.) An<br>\
Arab of the desert, in describing the wars of his<br>\
people, said, تَارَةً نُجْنَقْ وَأُخْرَى نُرْشَقْ [One time<br>\
we are cast at with the منجنيق, and another we<br>\
are shot at with arrows]: (S, * M:) also mentioned by El-Fárisee. (M.)<br>\

constructed the engines of the kind called منجنيق].<br>\

مَجْنَقُوا: see 1 and 2.<br>\
جُنُقٌ The stones of the منجنيق. (M, TA.)<br>\
[But] IAar says that جنق [app. جُنُقٌ] means The<br>\
people who manage the منجنيق. (TA.)<br>\
مُجَينِيقٌ dim. of مَنْجَنِيقٌ, q. v. (Sb, S.)<br>\
مَنْجَنُوقٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
مَنْجَنِيقٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and مِنْجَنِيقٌ (Msb, K)<br>\
and ↓ مَنْجَنُوقٌ (Lth, IAar, Msb, K) [A kind of<br>\
balista;] an instrument [or engine of war] with<br>\
which stones are cast (S, M, K, TA) at the enemy;<br>\
made by binding [in some manner] very tall<br>\
wooden poles, whereon is placed what is to be<br>\
cast, which is then struck with a long pole, and<br>\
so cast to a very distant place: [this imperfect<br>\
description (the only one that I have found of<br>\
this engine) seems to show that it was of a very<br>\
simple and rude construction:] it is an ancient<br>\
instrument, anterior to the invention [or use] of<br>\
gunpowder and cannons by the Christians; and<br>\
was used by Mohammad in the siege of Et-Táïf;<br>\
but the first [of the Arabs] who used it in the<br>\
time of paganism is said to have been Jedheemeh<br>\
El-Abrash, of the Mulook et-Tawáïf: (TA:) pl.<br>\
مَنْجَنِيقَاتٌ (S, Msb, K) and مَنْجَنُوقَاتٌ (Lth, TA)<br>\
and مَجَانِيقُ (Sb, S, Msb, K) and مَجَانِقُ: (K:)<br>\
dim. ↓ مُجَيْنِيقٌ: (Sb, S:) it is fem., (Lth, S, Msb,<br>\
K, *) preferably, (Lth, TA,) and in most instances;<br>\
(Msb;) and hence it is also called الأُنْثَى; (M in<br>\
art. انث;) but sometimes it is masc.: (Msb, K:)<br>\
and is arabicized, (S, Msb, K,) from the Persian<br>\
(S, K) مَنْ چِى نِيكْ, i. e. “ How excellent am I! ”<br>\
(S,) or مَنْ چِهْ نِيكْ, i. e. “ I, how excellent am<br>\
I! ” (K;) [Golius asserts it to be from the Greek<br>\
μάγγανον but this is the original of مَنْجَنُونٌ,<br>\
which has a different meaning: its derivation,<br>\
however, seems to have been unknown to the<br>\
Arabs in general; for] some say that مَنْجَنِيقٌ is of<br>\
the measure مَفْعَلِيلٌ, [so in copies of the S, but<br>\
correctly مَنْفَعِيلٌ, as in the Msb and TA,] because<br>\
of the phrase نُجْنَقُ مَرَّةً [see 1]: (S, Msb: *) or,<br>\
(Msb,) accord. to Sb, (S,) it is of the measure<br>\
فَنْعَلِيلٌ; (S, Msb;) because مَجَانِيقُ is its pl. and<br>\
the dim. is مُجَينِيقٌ; and because, if the م were<br>\
augmentative as well as the ن, there would be<br>\
two augmentative letters at the beginning of the<br>\
noun, and this may not be in substs. nor in epithets<br>\
that are not conformable to augmented verbs;<br>\
and if the ن were made an essential part of the<br>\
word, the noun would be a quadriliteral-radical,<br>\
and augmentative letters are not prefixed to words<br>\
of this class except nouns conformable to their<br>\
verbs, like مُدَحْرَجٌ: (S, TA:) but MF says that<br>\
these disquisitions are unprofitable; for in his<br>\
opinion, all the letters of the word are radical,<br>\
since it is a foreign word. (TA.)<br>\

called منجنيق; being mentioned as a surname:]<br>\
