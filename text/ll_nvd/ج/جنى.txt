جَنَى الثَّمَرَةَ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
جَنِىَ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) inf. n. جَنًى, (S, TA,) or جَنْىٌ, (so accord.<br>\
to one copy of the S, and written in the accus. case<br>\
جنيا in the Ham p. 355,) and جِنَايَةٌ, (Ham ib., but<br>\
there without any vowel-signs,) He gathered,<br>\
plucked, or took from the tree, the fruit; (Mgh,<br>\
TA;) i. q. ↓ اجتناها (S, Msb, K) and ↓ تجنّاها:<br>\
(K:) and in like manner one says of a thing similar<br>\
to fruit. (TA.) One says also, جَنَاهَا لَهُ and جَنَاهُ إِيَّاهَا<br>\
[He gathered it, plucked it, or took it from the<br>\
tree, for him]. (A&#39;Obeyd, K.) And جَنَيْتُكَ أَكْمُؤًا<br>\
[I gathered for thee truffles]. (TA.) And جَنَى<br>\
ذَهَبًا He collected gold from its mine. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Aboo-Dhu-eyb uses this verb metaphorically, in<br>\
the phrase جَنَى العُلَى, meaning (tropical:)  [He acquired]<br>\
eminence, or nobility. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  You also say,<br>\
جَنَى عَلَيْهِ, (S,) or عَلَى قَوْمِهِ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
جِنَايَةٌ, (S, Msb,) (tropical:)  He committed, [against him,<br>\
or] against his people, or party, a crime, or an<br>\
offence for which he should be punished; (Msb;)<br>\
as also ↓ جاناهُ [or جانى قَوْمِهِ]: (TK in art. جر:)<br>\
[and (tropical:)  he brought an injury upon him, or them:]<br>\
and جَنَى الذَّنْبِ عَلَيْهِ, aor.<br>\
جَنِىَ, inf. n. جِنَايَةٌ, (K,)<br>\
with kesr, (TA,) (tropical:)  He committed the crime, offence,<br>\
or injurious action, against him; syn. جَرَّهُ إِلَيْهِ:<br>\
(K: [see art. جر:]) thus used, also, the verb is<br>\
metaphorical, from جَنَى الثَّمَرَةَ: (Er-Rághib, TA:)<br>\
and so in the phrase, جَنَى شَرًّا, meaning (tropical:)  He<br>\
brought to pass an evil thing or action. (Mgh.)<br>\
[See also جِنَايَةٌ, below.] It is said in a trad.,<br>\
لَا يَجْنِى جَانٍ إِلَّا عَلَى نَفْسِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [An injurer shall<br>\
not bring injury save on himself]; meaning that<br>\
one shall not be prosecuted for an injurious action<br>\
committed by another, of his relations or of others.<br>\
(TA.) And a poet says,<br>\
جَانِيكَ مَنْ يَجْنِى عَلَيْكَ وَقَدْ<br>\
تُعْدِي الصِّجَاحَ فَتَجْرَبُ الجُرْبُ<br>\
[which may be rendered, (assumed tropical:)  Thine injurer whom<br>\
thou shouldst punish is he who brings an injury<br>\
upon thee: but sometimes the mangy camels infect<br>\
the sound ones so that these become mangy; and<br>\
thus a criminal sometimes brings punishment<br>\
upon his relations: for] A&#39;Obeyd says that جانيك<br>\
من يجنى عليك is a prov. applied to the case of a<br>\
man who is punished for an injurious action;<br>\
because brothers [sometimes] bring injury upon a<br>\
man [by occasioning his being punished for an<br>\
injurious action which they have themselves committed], as the latter hemistich of the verse cited<br>\
above indicates: but AHeyth says that this prov.<br>\
means الجَانِى لَكَ الخَيْرَ مَنْ يَجْنِى عَلَيْكَ الشَّرَّ [The<br>\
person bringing thee good is he who brings, or will<br>\
bring, upon thee evil: perhaps intended as a<br>\
caution; for the Arabs often suspect that a benefactor has some evil intention]: and he cites the<br>\
following hemistich:<br>\
تُعْدِي الصِّحَاحَ مَبَارِكُ الجُرْبِ<br>\
[meaning Sometimes the places where the mangy<br>\
camels lie down, and which afford benefit to other<br>\
camels, infect the sound ones]. (TA. [See also<br>\
Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov., i. 298.]) You say also,<br>\
جَنَيْتَ هٰذَا عَلَى نَفْسِكَ [Thou hast brought this<br>\
as an injury upon thyself]. (K in art. جل.)<br>\
3<br>\
جانى عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. مُجَانَاةٌ, He accused him<br>\
of a جِنَايَة [or crime, &amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1.<br>\

اجنى said of a tree, (S, K,) or of a palmtree, (Msb,) It had ripe fruit: (S:) or it attained<br>\
to the time for the gathering of its fruit: (Msb:)<br>\
or it attained to maturity: (K:) or, said of a<br>\
tree, it had fruit to be gathered and eaten: and,<br>\
said of fruit, it became ripe: (TA:) and, said of<br>\
grass, or herbage, it became abundant. (KL.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And اجنتِ الأَرْضُ The land had much جَنًى,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) i. e. herbage, and truffles, and the<br>\
like. (S.)<br>\

تَجَنَّىَ see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  تجنّى عَلَيْهِ, (S, * K,) or تجنّى عليه<br>\
ذَنْبًا, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He accused him of a crime, an offence,<br>\
or an injurious action, that he had not committed;<br>\
(S, K;) i. e. he forged against him the charge of<br>\
his having committed a crime, &amp;c., he being guiltless [thereof]: (TA:) النَّجَنِّى being like التَّجَرُّمُ.<br>\
(S.) You say also, يَتَجَنَّى عَلَيْنَا مَا لَمْ نَجْنِهِ [He<br>\
accuses us of committing what we did not commit].<br>\
(Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, TA in art. جرم.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِجْتَنَىَ see 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  اِجْتَنَيْنَا مَآءِ مَطَرٍ We came to rainwater, and drank it: (K:) a phrase mentioned<br>\
with approval by IAar, but not explained by<br>\
him: thought by ISd to have this meaning. (TA.)<br>\
جَنًى [in the CK جَنِىٌّ] Whatever is gathered,<br>\
or plucked; as also ↓ جَنَاةٌ: (K:) or whatever<br>\
is gathered, or plucked, from trees, (S,) &amp;c.; (so<br>\
in a copy of the S;) as also ↓ جَنَاةٌ: (S:) so that<br>\
these two words are of the same class as حِقٌّ and<br>\
حِقَّةٌ: or the latter of them is a n. un.: (TA:)<br>\
or the former signfies what is gathered from<br>\
trees while fresh; (Msb;) as also ↓ جَنِىٌّ: (Msb:)<br>\
or this last is an epithet applied to fruit, signifying<br>\
just gathered or plucked; (S, K;) or gathered,<br>\
or plucked, while fresh: (TA:) and ↓ مَجْنًى,<br>\
also, pl. مَجَانٍ, signifies fruit gathered or plucked:<br>\
(Har p. 369:) جَنًى also signifies fruit [ready to<br>\
be gathered or plucked]; so in the Kur lv. 54:<br>\
(Jel:) and is applied to fresh ripe dates: (Fr,<br>\
K:) and grapes: (TA:) and truffles, and the<br>\
like: (S:) and even cotton: (TA:) and herbage:<br>\
(S:) and gold, (K,) which is collected from its<br>\
mine: (TA:) and cowries, (K,) as though<br>\
gathered from the sea: (TA:) and honey, (K,)<br>\
when it is gathered: (TA:) pl. أَجْنَآءٌ (K) and<br>\
أَجْنٍ, originally أَجْنُىٌ. (TA.) Hence the saying,<br>\
هٰذَا جَنَاى وَ خِيَارُهُ فِيهِ<br>\
إِذْكُلُّ جَانٍ يَدُهُ إِلَى فِيهِ<br>\
[This is what I have gathered, and the best of it<br>\
is in it; when every gatherer but myself has his<br>\
hand to his mouth]: or, accord. to one reading,<br>\
وَ هِجَانُهُ فِيهِ (which has the same meaning, TA in<br>\
art. هجن): a prov., ascribed by Ibn-El-Kelbee<br>\
to &#39;Amr Ibn-&#39; Adee El-Lakhmee, the son of the<br>\
daughter of Jedheemeh: he says that Jedheemeh<br>\
had ordered the people to gather for him truffles,<br>\
and some of them ate the best that they found;<br>\
but &#39; Amr brought to him the best that he found,<br>\
and addressed to him these words: and &#39;Alee is<br>\
related to have repeated them on an occasion of<br>\
his entering the government-treasury; meaning<br>\
that he had not defiled himself with anything of<br>\
the tribute belonging to the Muslims, but had<br>\
put it in its places. (TA.)<br>\
جَنَاةٌ: see جَنًى, in two places.<br>\

or taking from a tree, fruit: [see 1:] ―<br>\

(assumed tropical:)  The bringing to pass an evil thing, or action:<br>\
(Mgh, Kull p. 147:) ―<br>\
-b3-  then, (assumed tropical:)  Evil, [itself]: ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
then, (assumed tropical:)  The doing a forbidden action: (Kull ib.:)<br>\
specially used in this last sense; though it has a<br>\
general application: (Mgh:) ―<br>\
-b5-  [as a simple subst.,<br>\
it generally signifies] A crime, an offence, or an<br>\
injurious action, for which one should be punished:<br>\
(Msb:) or an action that a man commits requiring punishment or retaliation to be inflicted<br>\
upon him in the present world and in the world<br>\
to come: (TA:) or any forbidden injurious<br>\
action: (Kull p. 134:) and in the language of<br>\
the lawyers, especially a wounding: and an amputation, or a maiming: (Msb:) and ↓ جَنِيَّةٌ<br>\
signifies the same as جِنَايَةٌ: (Ham p. 241:) the<br>\
pl. of جناية is جِنَايَاتٌ and جَنَايَا; but the latter<br>\
of these pls. is of rare occurrence. (Msb.)<br>\
جَنِيَّةٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\

أَجْنَآءٌ, which last is extr., (S, K,) or doubtful.<br>\

in art. بنى. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
