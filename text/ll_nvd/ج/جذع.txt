اجذع, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِجْذَاعٌ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) He (a beast) became such as is<br>\
denoted by the term جَذَعٌ; (TA;) said of the<br>\
offspring of the sheep or goat, he became in his<br>\
second year; of that of the cow, and of a solidhoofed beast, he became in his third year; and of<br>\
that of the camel, he became in his fifth year:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) but sometimes, when said of the<br>\
offspring of the ewe, it means he became six<br>\
months old, or nine months old; and such is allowable as a victim for sacrifice: (S:) IAar says, it<br>\
denotes a time, not a tooth (Mgh, Msb) growing<br>\
or falling out: (Msb:) and said of a she-goat,<br>\
اجذعت means she became a year old, and sometimes, less than a year, by reason of plenty of<br>\
food; and of a sheep, اجذع means, when from<br>\
young parents, he became from six months old to<br>\
seven; and when from very old parents, from<br>\
eight months old to ten. (Mgh, Msb.) [See<br>\
جَذَعٌ, below.]<br>\

تجاذع (tropical:)  He (a man) pretended to be a جَذَع<br>\
[or youth]. (TA.)<br>\
جِذْعٌ The trunk of a palm-tree: (S, * Msb, K:)<br>\
or, accord to some, only after it has become dry:<br>\
or, accord. to some, only after it has been cut:<br>\
(TA:) or the trunk of a tree when the head has<br>\
gone: (Ham p. 656:) in the Kur, xix. 23, it is<br>\
applied to the trunk of a palm-tree which had<br>\
become dry and was without a head; (Bd;)<br>\
therefore this does not indicate any restriction nor<br>\
the contrary: (TA:) pl. [of pauc.] أجْذَاعٌ (Msb)<br>\
and [of mult.] جُذُوعٌ. (S, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The beam of<br>\
a roof. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
جَذَعٌ A beast (Lth, Mgh) before the ثَنِىّ [q. v.],<br>\
(Lth, S, Mgh, Msb, K,) by one year; when it<br>\
may for the first time be ridden and used: (Lth:)<br>\
fem. with ة: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:) pl. masc. [of<br>\
pauc.] أجْذَاعٌ (Yoo, O) and [of mult.] جُذْعَانٌ<br>\
(Yoo, S, Mgh, Msb, K) and جِذْعَانٌ (L, Msb)<br>\
and جِذَاعٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and جُذَاعٌ; (Yoo,<br>\
O;) and pl. fem. جَذَعَاتٌ: (S, Msb:) it is a<br>\
name applied to the beast in a particular time, not<br>\
denoting a tooth growing or falling out: (S, K:)<br>\
but it differs in its application to different kinds<br>\
of beasts: (Az:) applied to a sheep or goat,<br>\
it means a year old; (IAar;) in his second<br>\
year: (Mgh:) or, applied to a sheep, a year<br>\
old; and sometimes less than a year, by reason<br>\
of plenty of food; (IAar;) or eight months<br>\
old, (Az, Mgh, TA,) or nine; (TA;) or, when<br>\
from young parents, from six months old to<br>\
seven; and when from very old parents from<br>\
eight months old to ten; (IAar, Mgh;) and the<br>\
sheep thus called is a satisfactory victim for sacrifice: (Mgh, TA:) and applied to a goat, a year<br>\
old; (Az, Mgh;) or in its second year; (AZ;)<br>\
but the goat thus called is not a satisfactory victim for sacrifice: (Mgh:) applied to a bull, it<br>\
means in like manner in his second year; (Mgh;)<br>\
or in his third year; and the bull thus called is<br>\
not a satisfactory victim for sacrifice: (TA:)<br>\
applied to a horse, it means in his third year;<br>\
(IAar;) or in his fourth year: (Mgh:) [but see<br>\
قَارِحٌ:] and applied to a camel, in his fifth year;<br>\
(Az, Mgh;) fem. with ة; and this (a جذعة) is<br>\
what must be given for the poor-rate when the<br>\
camels are more than sixty. (Az, TA.) [See also<br>\
شَصَرٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  A youth, or young man. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  One<br>\
who is light-witted, or weak and stupid, like a youth:<br>\
opposed in this sense to بَازِلٌ as meaning “ old: ”<br>\
(IAar, TA:) or one whose teeth have fallen out,<br>\
here and there, [as though likened to a beast thus<br>\
termed that has shed some of his first teeth,]<br>\
because he has drawn near to his appointed term<br>\
of life. (TA: [but it is not quite clear whether<br>\
this explanation relate to جذع or to بازل.]) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
(tropical:)  [A novice, or recent beginner.] You say, فُلَانٌ<br>\
فِى هٰذَا الأَمْرِ جَذَعٌ (tropical:)  [Such a one, in this affair,<br>\
is a novice, or recent beginner,] when he has<br>\
begun it recently. (S, Z.) ―<br>\
-b5-  الدَّهْرُ جَذَعٌ أَبَدًا<br>\
(tropical:)  Time, or fortune, is ever new, like a youth.<br>\
(K, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Hence, (TA,) الأَزْلَمُ الجَذَعُ (tropical:)  Time,<br>\
or fortune; (S, K;) as in the saying, أَهْلَكَهُمُ<br>\
الأَزْلَمُ الجَذَعُ (tropical:)  Time, or fortune, destroyed them;<br>\
and لَا آتِيكَ الأَزْلَمَ الجَذَعَ (tropical:)  I will not come to thee<br>\
ever. (TA.) [See also art. زلم.] And accord. to<br>\
some, (S,) The lion: (S, K:) but this is a mistake.<br>\
(IB, L.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And hence, (TA,) أُمُّ الجَذَعِ (tropical:)  Calamity, or misfortune. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  أَعَدْتُ الأَمْرَ جَذَعًا<br>\
(tropical:)  I renewed the thing, or affair, as it was at the<br>\
first: as, for instance, a war which had been<br>\
extinguished. (TA.) And فَرَّ الأَمْرَ جَذَعًا [signifies,<br>\
in like manner, (tropical:)  He recommenced the thing: or]<br>\
he commenced the thing. (TA.) And فُرَّ الأَمْرُ<br>\
جَذَعًا (tropical:)  The thing was commenced: (TA:) or the<br>\
thing returned to its first state; it recommenced.<br>\
(K in art. فر.) ―<br>\

جُذُوعَةٌ [The state of being what is denoted by<br>\
the term جَذَعٌ;] a subst. from إِجْذَاعٌ [inf. n. of<br>\
اجذع]. (TA.)<br>\
جَذْعَمَةٌ Young; (S, K, * TA;) not arrived at<br>\
puberty: (TA:) originally جَذْعَةٌ; (S, K;) the<br>\
م being augmentative: (S:) the ة is either to<br>\
give intensiveness to the meaning, or to denote<br>\
the fem. gender; the word being considered as<br>\
implying the meaning of نَفْسٌ or جُثَّةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
خَرُوفٌ مُتَجَاذِعٌ [A lamb approaching the age<br>\
in which the term جَذَعٌ is applied to him: expl.<br>\
in some copies of the K by دَانٍ: in others, by<br>\
وَانٍ:] in the copies of the O, expl. by وَانٍ مِنَ<br>\
الإِجْذَاعِ: in the TS and in the A, by دَانٍ, which<br>\
is probably the right reading. (TA.)<br>\
Quasi جذعم<br>\
