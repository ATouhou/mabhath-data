the former, he (an ostrich, K) hastened, or sped,<br>\
(S, K,) in his pace, (TA,) and went away in the<br>\
land, or country; as also ↓ اجفل; (IDrd, K;)<br>\
both, said of an ostrich, mean he spread his<br>\

wings, and ran quickly, or went away at random<br>\
and swiftly: (TA:) or جَفَلَتِ النَّعَامَةُ means the<br>\
ostrich fled: (Msb:) and عَنْهُ ↓ اجفل, said of<br>\

-A2-  جَفَلَ is also trans., signifying He made a bird<br>\

جَفِلَ, (K,) He swept away mud<br>\
(Msb, K, TA) from the ground; (TA;) and so<br>\
↓ جفّل. (K.) [It seems that Golius found, in a<br>\
copy of the K, التِّبْنَ erroneously put for الطِّينَ;<br>\
and حَرَقَهُ for جَرَفَهُ; for he has explained the<br>\
former verb as meaning “ combussit stramen. ”]<br>\
