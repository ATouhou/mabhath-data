namely, a criminal: (Msb:) he struck him with<br>\
a whip, and with a sword: (TA:) he flogged<br>\
him (A, K) with a whip, (K,) or with whips:<br>\
(A:) جَلَدْتُ is sometimes written and pronounced<br>\
جَلَدُّ. (MF on the letter د.) You say, جَلَدَهُ الحَدَّ,<br>\
inf. n. as above, He inflicted upon him the flogging<br>\
ordained by the law. (S, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  جَلَدَتِ الحَيَّةُ The<br>\
serpent bit: (K:) or, accord. to some, one says<br>\
of the serpent called أَسْوَدُ, specially, يَجْلِدُ بِذَنَبِهِ<br>\
[it strikes with its tail]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  جَلَدَ جَارِيَتَهُ,<br>\
(K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,) (tropical:)  He lay<br>\
with his young woman, or female slave. (K, TA.)<br>\
[Hence,] جَلَدَ عُمَيْرَةَ [(assumed tropical:)  i. q. نَكَحَ اليَدَ], a metonymical phrase: جَلْدُ عُمَيْرَةَ meaning الخَضْخَضَةُ,<br>\
and الاِسْتِمْنَآءُ بِاليَدِ, also termed التَّدْلِيلُ, and<br>\
الاِعْتِمَارُ: the similar act of a woman is termed<br>\
الإِلْطَافُ. (Har p. 572.) ―<br>\
-b4-  جَلَدَ بِهِ الأَرْضَ He<br>\
smote the ground with him; (TA;) he threw him<br>\
down prostrate on the ground. (A, TA.) And<br>\
جُلِدَ بِهِ He fell down (K, TA) upon the ground<br>\
by reason of much sleepiness; as also جُلِدَ بِهِ نُوْمًا.<br>\
(TA.) كُنْتُ أَتَشَدَّدُ فَيُجْلَدُ بِى, in a trad., means<br>\
[I used to exert my strength, or energy, but]<br>\
sleep would overcome me so that I fell down.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  جَلَدَهُ عَلَى الأَمْرِ (tropical:)  He compelled him<br>\
against his will to do the thing. (A, K.) ―<br>\

يُجْلَدُ بِكُلِّ خَيْرٍ (or, as related by AHát, يجلذ,<br>\
with ذ, TA) (tropical:)  He is imagined to possess every<br>\
good quality. (A, K.) But the saying of EshSháfi&#39;ee كَانَ مُجَالِدٌ يُجْلَدُ means (assumed tropical:)  Mujálid<br>\
used to be pronounced a liar, (K, TA,) or suspected and accused of lying. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  جُلِدَتِ<br>\
الأَرْضُ, (S, L, Msb,) the verb being in the pass.<br>\
form, (Msb,) or جَلِدَت, (A, K,) a verb of the<br>\
same form as فَرِحَ; (K;) [or both may be correct,<br>\
like ضُرِبَت and ضَرِبَت in the same sense;] and<br>\
↓ أَجْلَدَت; (K;) [but this last I believe to be a<br>\
mistake for أُجْلِدَت, like أُضْرِبَت;] The land was,<br>\
or became, affected or smitten, by hoar-frost, or<br>\
rime. (S, A, L, Msb, K.) And جلد البَقْلُ [in<br>\

inf. n. like مَحْلُوفٌ and مَعْقُولٌ, (S, or from تَجَلَّدَ,<br>\
M in art. عسر,) He (a man, S, L) was, or became,<br>\
hardy, strong, sturdy, (S, * L, K, *) and enduring,<br>\
or patient. (L.)<br>\
2<br>\
جلّد, (IAar, T, S, Mgh,) inf. n. تَجْلِيدٌ, (T,<br>\
S, Mgh, K,) He skinned a camel (IAar, T, S,<br>\
Mgh, K) that had been slaughtered: (S, K:) one<br>\
seldom uses سَلَخَ thus [in relation to a camel].<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He covered a thing with skin; as, for<br>\
instance, a pair of socks, or stockings: (Mgh:)<br>\
and in like manner, [he bound] a book: (A, K: *)<br>\
and he clad a young camel in the skin of another<br>\
young camel: (L: [see جَلَدٌ:]) thus the verb<br>\
bears two contr. significations. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  [He<br>\
ordered to be flogged. (Freytag&#39;s Lex.: but<br>\
without any indication of an authority.)]<br>\
-A3-  [He,<br>\

enduring, or patient: so in the present day.]<br>\
3<br>\

مُجَالَدَةٌ (S, A, L) and جِلَادٌ, (A, L,) He contended with him in fight with the sword. (S, * A,<br>\
L.) And جَالَدُوهُمْ بِالسُّيُوفِ They contended with<br>\
them in fight with swords. (A.) And جالدوا<br>\
بِالسُّيُوفِ, (K, TA,) and ↓ تجالدوا (S, A, L, and so<br>\
in the CK instead of جالدوا) بالسيوف, (S,) and<br>\
↓ اجتلدوا, (S, A, L,) They contended, one with<br>\
another, in fight with swords. (S, A, * L, K.) ―<br>\

4<br>\
اجلدهُ إِلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He constrained, compelled, or<br>\
necessitated, him to have recourse to, or betake<br>\
himself to, him, or it: (so in some copies of the<br>\
K:) or he made him to stand in need of, or to<br>\
want, him, or it. (AA, L, and so in some copies<br>\
of the K and in the TA.)<br>\
-A2-  أَجْلَدَتِ الأَرْضُ [or<br>\
أُجْلِدَت]: and أُجْلِدُوا: see 1.<br>\
5<br>\
تجلّد He affected hardiness, strength, sturdiness, and endurance, or patience; constrained<br>\
himself to behave with hardiness, &amp;c. (S, * A, * L,<br>\
K. *) So in the phrase تجلّد لِلشَّامِتِينَ [He constrained himself to behave with hardiness, &amp;c., to<br>\
those who rejoiced at his misfortune]. (A, TA.)<br>\
In the phrase تجلّد عَنْهُ [He constrained himself<br>\
to endure with hardiness and patience the loss, or<br>\
want, of him, or it], the verb is made trans. by<br>\
means of عن because it implies the meaning of<br>\
تَصَبَّرَ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He feigned, or made a show<br>\
of, hardiness, strength, sturdiness, and endurance,<br>\
or patience. (L.)<br>\

↓ جَلِيدٌ, (applied to a man, S, A, Mgh,) Hardy,<br>\
strong, sturdy, (S, * A, * L, K, *) and enduring, or<br>\
patient: (L:) not بَلِيد [q. v.]: (Mgh:) pl. [of<br>\
either] جُلْدٌ, (S, L, K,) or جُلُدٌ, (so in some<br>\
copies of the K,) and جُلَدَآءُ and أَجْلَادٌ [a pl. of<br>\
pauc.] (S, L, K) and جِلَادٌ. (K.) And [the fem.]<br>\
جَلْدَةٌ A hardy and strong she-camel; strong to<br>\
labour and to journey; that heeds not the cold:<br>\
and also swift: pl. جَلْدَاتٌ: (L:) and a she-camel<br>\
that yields a copious flow of milk: (Th, TA:)<br>\
sing. of جِلَادٌ, (S,) which signifies she-camels<br>\
abounding with milk; as also مَجَالِيدُ, (K,) pl. of<br>\
↓ مِجْلَادٌ; (TA;) or she-camels having neither<br>\
milk nor young: (K:) [see also جَلَدٌ:] or she-camels that yield the most greasy, or unctuous,<br>\
sort of milk: and so the sing., جلدة, applied to a<br>\
ewe or a she-goat. (S.) جِلَادٌ (pl. of جَلْدَةٌ, TA)<br>\
is also applied to palm-trees, meaning Large,<br>\
hard, hardy, or strong: (S, K, TA:) or such as<br>\
are not affected by drought. (TA.) And تَمْرَةٌ<br>\
جَلْدَةٌ signifies A tough-skinned, excellent, date;<br>\
as also ↓ جِلْدَةٌ: and a hard, compact, date. (L.)<br>\
جِلْدٌ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) the only form of the<br>\
word mentioned by the generality of the lexicographers; (TA;) occurring at the end of a verse<br>\
with kesr to the second as well as the first letter,<br>\
↓ جِلِدٌ, agreeably with a license allowed to a poet<br>\
in such a case, to give to a quiescent letter in a<br>\
rhyme the same vowel as that which the preceding<br>\
letter has; (S;) and ↓ جَلَدٌ, (IAar, S, K,) like<br>\
شِبْهٌ and شَبَهٌ, and مِثْلٌ and مَثَلٌ; but this is said<br>\
by ISk to be unknown; (S;) The skin of any<br>\
animal; (K;) the integument of the body and<br>\
limbs of an animal: (Az, Msb:) or the exterior<br>\
of the بَشَرَةٌ [or upper skin] of an animal: (Msb:<br>\
[but this is a strange explanation:]) pl. جُلُودٌ (S,<br>\

and ↓ تَجَالِيدُ likewise, The body and limbs (S, A,<br>\
L) of a man; (S;) the whole person, or body and<br>\
limbs, of a human being; (L, K;) and his self:<br>\
(L:) so called because enclosed by the skin: pl.<br>\
of the former, أَجَالِدُ. (L.) You say, مَا أَشْبَهَ<br>\
أَجْلَادَهُ بِأَجْلَادِ أَبِيهِ How like are his person and<br>\

themselves: occurring in a trad.: said on the<br>\
occasion of a man&#39;s entering among others of<br>\
whom an oath had been demanded. (L.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
الجِلْدُ also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The penis. (Fr, L, K: but<br>\
in the CK, in this sense, it is written الجَلْدُ.)<br>\
Agreeably with this explanation, its pl. جُلُود is<br>\
said by Fr to be used in the Kur xli. 20: (L:)<br>\
or as meaning the pudenda: (L, K:) but ISd<br>\
holds that this word there means the skins, with<br>\
which, as in manual operations, acts of disobedience are performed. (L.)<br>\

the skin of a young camel, which is stuffed with<br>\
panic grass (ثُمَام), (K, TA,) or some other plant,<br>\
(TA,) and put before a she-camel, in order that<br>\
