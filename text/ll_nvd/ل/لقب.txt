بِالفَاءِ وَالعَيْنِ وَاللَّامِ] He called the noun by an<br>\
appellation in which its radical letters were represented by ف, ع, and ل; this appellation being<br>\

لَقَبٌ A by-name; a surname; a nickname;<br>\
syn. نَبَزٌ: (S, K:) a name of reproach; an<br>\
opprobrious appellation: in this sense forbidden:<br>\
(Msb:) it is said in the Kur, xlix., 11, لَا تَنَابَزُوا<br>\
بِالْأَلْقَابِ Call not one another by nicknames; i. e.,<br>\
let not one of you call another by a name which<br>\
he dislikes: (Jel:) also a by-name, or surname,<br>\
which is not one of reproach: such are the surnames given to certain Imáms; الأَنْمَشُ and<br>\
الأَخْفَشُ and الاَّعْرَجُ and the like; and such are<br>\
not forbidden, because by them is not meant<br>\
reproach, or disparagement, but they are meant<br>\
as mere appellations given with the approval of<br>\
the persons to whom they are applied. (Msb.)<br>\
[A لَقَب is distinguished from a كُنْيَة, q. v.] Pl.<br>\
