لَغَزَهُ, aor.<br>\
لَغُزَ, (TK,) inf. n. لَغْزٌ, (IF, A, Msb,<br>\
K,) He turned it from its proper mode or manner; distorted it. (IF, A, Msb, K, TA, TK.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] لَغَزَ جِحَرَتَهُ, and ↓ أَلْغَزَهَا, He (a<br>\
jerboa) made his burrows winding, or tortuous,<br>\
and perplexing to the enterer thereof. And لَغَزَ<br>\
فِى حَفْرِهِ, and ↓ أَلْغَزَ, He pursued a winding, or<br>\
tortuous, course in his burrowing. (A.)<br>\
2<br>\
لَغَّزَ see 4.<br>\

رَأَيْتُهُ يُلَاغِزُهُ وَيُلَامِزُهُ (tropical:)  [I saw him talking<br>\
enigmatically, or obscurely, with him, or to him,<br>\
and making signs with him, or to him.] (A,<br>\
TA.) [See also 3 in arts. حجو and عى.]<br>\

أَلْغَزَ see 1, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  الغز كَلَامَهُ, (A,<br>\
K,) and الغز فِى كَلَامِهِ, (S, A, Msb, K,) signify<br>\
alike: (K:) or the former, (tropical:)  He made his speech,<br>\
or language, enigmatical, or obscure; not plain:<br>\
(A:) and the latter, (S, A,) or both, (K,) he<br>\
made his meaning enigmatical, or obscure, in his<br>\
speech, or language; (S, A, K;) as also ↓ لغّز:<br>\
(A:) or the second, he used parabolical language:<br>\
(Msb:) or both, he concealed a meaning different<br>\
from that which he made apparent: or he was<br>\
equivocal, or ambiguous, in his speech, or language,<br>\
for the purpose of concealment: as in the following verse, cited by Fr:<br>\
وَلَمَّا رَأَيْتُ النَّسْرَ عَزَّ أَبْنَ دَأُيَةَ<br>\
وَعَشَّشَ فِى وَكْرَيْهِ جَاشَتْ لَهُ نَفْسِى<br>\
(tropical:)  [And when I saw that the vulture had overcome the raven, and nested in his nest, (lit., in his<br>\
two nests,) my soul, or stomach, heaved thereat]:<br>\
the poet likens hoariness to the vulture, because<br>\
of its whiteness [or grayness]; and youthfulness<br>\
to the black raven, because the hair of youth<br>\
is black. (TA.) You say also, الغز فِى يَمِينِهِ<br>\
(tropical:)  He practised [equivocation, or ambiguity, (see<br>\
لُغَّيْزَى,) or] concealment, [by a mental reservation,<br>\
or otherwise,] towards the person sworn to, in his<br>\
oath: the doing of which is forbidden. (A.)<br>\

لُغَزٌ (S, A, K) and ↓ لُغْزٌ and ↓ لَغْزٌ (K) and ↓ لَغَزٌ<br>\
and ↓ لُغَيْزَآءُ (TA) A winding, or tortuous, excavation or burrow: this is the primary signification: (IAar, in explanation of لُغْزٌ:) the<br>\
burrow of a jerboa, which he makes between the<br>\
قَاصِعَآء and نَافِقَآء, burrowing strait downwards,<br>\
and then turning crosswise to the right and left,<br>\
so that his place becomes concealed: (S, K, *<br>\
TA:) or the burrow of the [lizard called] ضَبّ,<br>\
and of the jerboa, (A, K,) and of the rat or<br>\
mouse: (K:) pl. [of the first four] أَلْغَازٌ. (S, A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (K,) أَلْغَازٌ (tropical:)  Winding, or tortuous,<br>\
roads, or ways, perplexing to him who pursues<br>\
them. (A, * K.) You say, إِلْزَمِ الجَادَّةَ وَإِيَّاكَ<br>\
وَالأَلْغَازَ (tropical:)  [Keep thou to the main road, and avoid<br>\
the winding, or tortuous, by-ways, which perplex<br>\
him who pursues them]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence<br>\
also, (S,) لُغَزٌ (S, A, Sgh, Msb, K [omitted in<br>\
the copies of the K consulted by the author of<br>\
the TA, through inadvertence, as he observes,<br>\
but mentioned in the CK,]) and ↓ لُغْزٌ [which is<br>\
now the most common form] and ↓ لُغُزٌ and ↓ لَغَزٌ<br>\
(Sgh, K) and ↓ لُغَّيْزَى, (S, K,) with teshdeed to<br>\
the غ, and not a dim., because the ى of the<br>\
dim. does not occupy a fourth place, but like<br>\
خُضَّارَى and شُقَّارَى, (S,) and ↓ لُغَيْزَآءُ, (Az, K,)<br>\
like حُمَيْرَآءُ, (K,) [and app. ↓ لُغَّيْزَآءُ also, with<br>\
teshdeed, (see what follows,)] and ↓ أُلْغُوزَةٌ, (K,)<br>\
(tropical:)  An enigma; a riddle; enigmatical, or obscure,<br>\
language: (S, A, K:) or parabolical language:<br>\
(Msb:) pl. (of the first four, K, TA) أَلْغَازٌ.<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K.) And in like manner, يَمِينٌ<br>\
↓ لُغَّيْزَآءُ, accord. to Z, with teshdeed to the غ<br>\
mentioned by Sb with خُلَّيْطَآءُ, or, accord. to Az,<br>\
without teshdeed, [لُغَيْزَآءُ,] which he regards as<br>\
the dim. of the form with teshdeed, like as<br>\
سُكَيْتٌ is of سُكَّيْتٌ, (tropical:)  An oath in which is equivocation, or ambiguity, and concealment [by mental<br>\
reservation or otherwise]. (TA.)<br>\
لُغُزٌ: see لُغَزٌ.<br>\
لَغَّازٌ (tropical:)  One who often, or habitually, speaks evil<br>\
of others in their absence; (K, TA;) as though<br>\
he did so in equivocal or ambiguous language.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
لُغَيْزَآءُ: see لُغَزٌ, in three places.<br>\
لُغَّيْزَى and لُغَّيْزَآءُ: see لُغَزٌ; the second in two<br>\
places.<br>\
