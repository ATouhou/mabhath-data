intense and the air calm: and he who asserts<br>\
the لعاب الشمس to be the سراب says what is<br>\
false; for that is the سراب that is seen at mid-day<br>\
resembling running water: only he knows<br>\
these things who has been constantly in the<br>\
deserts, and has journeyed during the mid-day<br>\
heats. (Az.) [In Egypt, in very hot and calm<br>\

brother in play (and) in earnest]: by this is<br>\
meant taking a thing without meaning to steal<br>\
it, but meaning to vex and anger the owner; so<br>\
that the taker is in play with respect to theft,<br>\
but in earnest in annoying. (TA, from a trad.)<br>\

in the desert; (TA;) sometimes called خَاطِفُ ظِلِّهِ,<br>\
