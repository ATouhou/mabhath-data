also a collection of words, a phrase, or sentence;<br>\

phrase itself;] the latter also called لَفْظٌ مُرَكَّبٌ, a<br>\
compound expression, an expression composed<br>\
of two or more words: (Expos. of the Ajroomeeyeh, by the sheykh Khálid; &amp;c.:) and<br>\

q. v., is the n. un., as seems to be indicated in<br>\

while ruminating, and thereupon ejects her cud,<br>\

signification. (S, Sgh.) It has one or another<br>\
of these significations in the saying, اسْمَحُ مِنْ<br>\
