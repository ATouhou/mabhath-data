لَاتَ, aor. يَلُوتُ, He told, narrated, or gave<br>\
an account of, a thing different from that respecting which he was asked. (K.) [But accord. to some, the aor. is يَلِيتُ, and the verb<br>\
belongs to art. ليت.] It was said to ElAsadeeyeh, “What is المُدَاحَلَةُ ” and she<br>\
answered أَنْ يَلِيتَ الإِنْسَانُ شَيْئًا قَدْ عَلِمَهُ, i. e.,<br>\
“ The concealing a thing that one knows, and<br>\
telling, or narrating, something different from<br>\
it. ” (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  لَاتَ الخَبَرَ, aor. يَلُوتُ, He concealed the news, or information, (K,) and related<br>\
what was different therefrom. (TA.) [But see<br>\
above.] ―<br>\
-b3-  لَاتَ الرَّجُلَ, aor. يَلُوتُ, He told the<br>\
man, or narrated to him, a thing in a manner<br>\
different from the real state of the case: or he expressed the news, or information, to him obscurely,<br>\
or enigmatically, or obscured it to him, or concealed<br>\
it from him, telling him, narrating to him, or<br>\
giving him an account of, a thing different from<br>\
that respecting which he was asked: but accord.<br>\
to As., لَاتَهُ, aor. يَلِيتُهُ, [not يَلُوتُهُ.] inf. n. لَيْتٌ,<br>\
signifies “ he expressed to him the news, or information, obscurely, or enigmatically, or obscured<br>\
it to him, or concealed it from him ”: thus he<br>\
makes it belong to art. ليت: and the like is said<br>\
in the L. See also above. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  لَاتَهُ, aor.<br>\
يَلُوتُ; as also لَاتَهُ, aor. يَلِيتُ; He withheld<br>\
him, or restrained him, and turned him, or<br>\
averted him, from his course, purpose, or object.<br>\
(S, K, art ليت, q. v.)<br>\
