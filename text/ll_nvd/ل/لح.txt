say هُوَ ابْنُ عَمٍّ لَحٍّ [He is a cousin on the father&#39;s<br>\

هما ابنا خَالٍ لَحًّا, nor ابنا عَمَّةٍ لَحًّا. (L.) When<br>\
the ابن عمّ is not in the state termed لَحّ, but is<br>\
of the عَشِيرَة, you say هُوَ ابْنُ عَمِّ الكَلَالَةِ, and ابنُ<br>\
عَمٍّ كَلَالَةٌ. (S, K.) [See also دِنْيًا; and the<br>\
contr., ظْهرًا.]<br>\
