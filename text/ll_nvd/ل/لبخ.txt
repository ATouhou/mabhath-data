load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'لبخلَبَخٌ, (L, K,) or لَبْخٌ, (as mentioned by AHn.,<br>\
on the authority of another, [but see below,])<br>\
[a coll. gen. n., n. un. with ة, The persea of Theophrastus and Dioscorides; (De Sacy, “Relation<br>\
de l&#39;Egypte par Abd-Allatif,” in which see a full<br>\
and learned disquisition respecting this tree,<br>\
pp. 47 et seqq.)] described to AHn, by a man<br>\
acquainted with it, as growing at Ansinè, in<br>\
Upper Egypt, as a kind of large tree, resembling<br>\
the دُلْب [or plane-tree], having a green fruit,<br>\
resembling the date, very sweet, but disagreeable,<br>\
excellent for pain in the teeth: when it is sawn, it<br>\
[meaning the saw-dust] makes blood to flow from<br>\
the nose of him who saws it: it is sawn into<br>\
planks, and a plank of it obtains the price of<br>\
fifty deenárs: it is used in the building of ships:<br>\
they assert that if two planks of it be strongly<br>\
attached together, and put in water for a year,<br>\
they unite, and form one plank: in the T it is not<br>\
said that they are put in water for a year, nor for<br>\
less, nor for more: some assert that this tree, in<br>\
Persia, killed; but when transplanted to Egypt,<br>\
it became such that [the fruit of] it was eaten,<br>\
without injuring: Ibn-Beytár mentions it. (L,<br>\
and parts also in the K.) The n. un. is also<br>\
explained as the name of a certain great tree,<br>\
like the أَثْأَبَة, or greater, the leaves of which<br>\
resemble those of the walnut-tree (الجَوْز), having<br>\
a fruit like that of the حَمَاط, bitter in taste,<br>\
which, when eaten, excites thirst; and when water<br>\
is drunk upon it, inflates the belly: it is one of<br>\
the trees of the mountains. (AHn, L.) [In a<br>\
verse cited by AHn, the coll. appellation of this<br>\
latter tree is read لَبَخ, with fet-h to the ل and<br>\
ب.] [The name of لَبَخ is now given in Egypt<br>\
to a kind of acacia; the mimosa lebbeck of<br>\
Linnæus: and لَبَخُ الجَبَل, to the menispermum<br>\
leæba of Delile; the leæba of Forskal. See<br>\
also لُبَاجٌ.]<br>\
لُبَاخٌ: see لُبَاخِيَّةٌ.<br>\
لُبُوخٌ Fleshiness of the body. (K.)<br>\
لَبِيخٌ A fleshy man. (L, K.)<br>\
لُبَاخِيَّةٌ A fleshy woman: (L, K:) bulky, or<br>\
corpulent: tall, and large in body: (L:) perfect<br>\
[in body or make]: as though it were a rel. n.<br>\
from ↓ اللُّبَاخ, [which is app. a word of no<br>\
meaning; or perhaps, but this I think improbable,<br>\
another name of the great tree called لَبْخ, or لَبَخ,<br>\
or the name of a place]. (S, L.)<br>\
