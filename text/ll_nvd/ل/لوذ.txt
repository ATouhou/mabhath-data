لَاذَ بِهِ, aor. يَلُوذُ, (S, A, L, Msb,) inf. n. لَوْذٌ<br>\
(S, L, K) and لِيَاذٌ (S, A, L, K) and لِوَاذٌ (L,<br>\
Msb, K) and لَوَاذٌ and لُوَاذٌ, (Msb, K,) He had<br>\
recourse to it, (a mountain [&amp;c.], Msb,) or him,<br>\
for refuge or protection or preservation; (S, A, L,<br>\
Msb;) as also به ↓ لاوذ, inf. n. لِوَاذٌ; (A;) and<br>\
به ↓ الاذ; (Msb;) sought, or took, refuge in it, or<br>\
him; (S, L;) and joined himself to him; and<br>\
sought, desired, implored, or called for, aid, or succour, of him: (L:) he protected, concealed, defended,<br>\
or fortified himself by it, (L, K,) or him; (L;)<br>\
as also به ↓ لاوذ, (L,) inf. n. مُلَاوَذَةٌ (L, K) and<br>\
لِوَاذٌ; (L;) and ↓ الاذ. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  لَاذَ بِهِ, (L,) inf. n.<br>\
as above, in the commencement of the art., (K,)<br>\
It encompassed, or surrounded, it; (L, K; *) as<br>\
also ↓ الاذ, (L,) inf. n. إِلَاذَةٌ. (L, K.) You say,<br>\
لَاذَ الطَّرِيقُ بِالدَّارِ, and ↓ الاذ, The road encompassed, or surrounded, the house: (L:) or, reached,<br>\
or extended, to the house: (Msb:) and لَاذَتِ الدَّارُ<br>\
بِالطَّرِيقِ The house encompassed, or surrounded,<br>\
the road. (L.) See also 3. ―<br>\
-b3-  لَاذَ بِالقَوْمِ and<br>\
بِهِم ↓ الاذ, He laboured, or strove, to overcome<br>\
the people in any way; expl. by the words<br>\
هى المداورة من حيث ماكان. (T, L.) [Perhaps<br>\
المداورة is a mistake for المُدَارَاة; see 3: the<br>\
same phrases being explained in the M by دَاَراهُمْ:<br>\
but there is a near resemblance between the<br>\
significations of المداورة and المداراة.]<br>\

لاوذ القَوْمُ, (S, L,) inf. n. مُلَاوَذَةٌ and لِوَاذٌ,<br>\
(S, L, K,) with which تَلْوَاذٌ is syn., (K,) The<br>\
people had recourse, one to another, for refuge or<br>\
protection or preservation; sought, or took, refuge,<br>\
one in another; protected, concealed, defended, or<br>\
fortified, themselves, one by another. (S, L, K. *)<br>\
Agreeably with this explanation, (as some say,<br>\
L,) لِوَاذًا is used in the Kur, xxiv. 63: were it<br>\
from لَاذَ, it would be لِيَاذًا. (S, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See 1. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
لاوذ بِهِمْ, inf. n. مُلَاوَذَةٌ, He went round about<br>\
them, or encompassed them. (Msb.) See also 1.<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  لاوذهُ, (M, L,) inf. n. مُلَاوَذَةٌ (K) and لِوَاذٌ,<br>\
(M, L, K,) He circumvented, or deluded, him;<br>\
(M, L, K; *) syn. رَاوَغَهُ (M, L) inf. n. مُرَاوَغَةٌ.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  لاوذهُمْ (M, L) and بِهِمْ ↓ لَاذَ, and ↓ الاذ,<br>\
(M,) He wheedled, beguiled, or deluded, them;<br>\
syn. دَارَاهُمْ. (M, L.) لاوذ He eluded, and shunned,<br>\
or avoided, thee: syn. رَاغَ عَنْكَ, and حَادَ<br>\
Agreeably with this explanation, or as signifying<br>\
مراوغة, some render لِوَاذًا in the Kur, xxiv. 63.<br>\
(Ibn-Is-Seed, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  لاوذهُ, (TK,) inf. n. مُلَاوَذَةٌ<br>\
(K) and لِوَاذٌ, (L, K,) He acted contrarily to, or<br>\
differently from, or adversely to, him; was, or<br>\
became contrary to, or different from, or adverse<br>\
to, him; (L, * K, * TK;) syn. خَالَفَهُ, (TK,) inf. n.<br>\
خِلَافٌ. (L, K.) Agreeably with this explanation,<br>\
Zj renders لِوَاذًا in the Kur, xxiv. 63; saying<br>\
that the meaning which he thus assigns to it is<br>\
shown to be the true one by the words immediately<br>\
following. (L.)<br>\
