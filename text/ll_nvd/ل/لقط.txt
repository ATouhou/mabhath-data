لَقَطَهُ, (S, Mgh, * Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
لَقُطَ, inf. n.<br>\
لَقْطٌ, (Msb, TA,) He picked it up, took it up,<br>\
raised it, (Mgh,) or took it, (S, K,) from the<br>\
ground, (S, Mgh, K,) without trouble or fatigue;<br>\
as also ↓ التقطهُ: (S:) or both signify he took it<br>\
from a place where it was not thought to be;<br>\
this being the primary signification: and hence,<br>\
he took it. (Msb.) It is said of a man: and<br>\
you say also, لَقَطَ الطَّائِرُ الحَبَّ [The bird picked<br>\
up from the ground the grains]. (Msb.) The<br>\
Arabs say to a calumniator, ↓ إِنَّ عِنْدَكَ دِيكًا يَلْتَقِطُ<br>\
الحَصَى [Verily thou hast a cock that picks up<br>\
pebbles]. (TA.) And it is said in a proverb,<br>\
أَصَيْدَ القُنْفُذِ أَمْ لَقْطَهُ [Is it by the hunting of<br>\
the hedgehog or the picking up thereof from the<br>\
ground?] applied to a poor man who becomes<br>\
rich suddenly. (TA.) [In Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov. (i. 726,) أَصَيْدُ القُنْفُذِ أَمْ لُقَطَةٌ: and there<br>\
asserted to be said of him who finds a thing<br>\
which he had not sought: or, accord. to Sharafed-Deen, of a thing of the nature of which we<br>\
may be uncertain.] You say also, لَقَطْتُ العِلْمِ<br>\
مِنَ الكُتُبِ (assumed tropical:)  [I picked up science, or knowledge,<br>\
from books;] I acquired science, or knowledge,<br>\
from this and that book. (Msb.) And لَقَطْتُ<br>\
أَصَابِعَهُ (assumed tropical:)  I took off his fingers, by cutting,<br>\
without [the main part of] the hand. (Msb.)<br>\
3<br>\
مُلَاقَطَةٌ A horse&#39;s lifting the legs all together<br>\
in the pace called تَقْرِيب: (AO, K: *) or, in the<br>\
pace called خَبَب, of a horse, it is similar to<br>\
مُنَاقَلَةٌ. (JK.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (K,) and ↓ لِقَاطٌ, (TA,)<br>\
The being over against, or facing. (K, TA.)<br>\
You say, دَارُهُ بِلِقَاطِ دَارِى His house is over<br>\
against, or faces, my house. (Lh, K.) And<br>\
لَقِيتُهُ لِقَاطاً I met him face to face. (IAar.)<br>\
5<br>\
تلقّط فُلَانٌ التَّمْرَ, or الثَّمَرَ, (S, accord. to<br>\
different copies, and K, *) Such a one, [picked up,<br>\
or] took up from the ground, from this and that<br>\
place, the dates, or the fruits. (S, K. *)<br>\
8<br>\
التقطهُ: see 1, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, He<br>\
collected it. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  He stumbled upon<br>\
it, or lighted on it, (K, TA,) unexpectedly, (TA,)<br>\
without seeking; (K, TA;) such a thing, for<br>\
instance, as a well, and herbage. (TA.) You<br>\
say also, وَرَدْتُ الشَّىْءَ الْتِقَاطًا (tropical:)  I came upon the<br>\
thing unexpectedly, or unawares; (S, TA:) and<br>\
لَقِيتُهُ الْتِقَاطًا (tropical:)  I met him unexpectedly: (TA:)<br>\
التقاطا in this sense being one of those inf. ns.<br>\
which are used as denotatives of state.<br>\
(Sb, TA.)<br>\
لَقَطٌ What is picked up, or taken from the<br>\
ground, (S, Msb, K,) of a thing; (S, Msb;)<br>\
as also ↓ لُقْطَةٌ and ↓ لُقَطَةٌ and ↓ لُقَاطَةٌ: (K:)<br>\
or ↓ this last signifies what one picks up, of lost<br>\
property; as also ↓ لُقَاطٌ, with the ة elided; and<br>\
↓ لُقَطَةٌ like رُطَبَةٌ: (Msb:) or ↓ لُقَاطَةٌ signifies<br>\
also what falls, or drops, of a thing that is<br>\
worthless, (K, TA,) or paltry, and is taken by<br>\
any one who chooses to take it: (TA:) and the<br>\
same, what is picked up from the stumps of the<br>\
branches of palm-trees, [app. meaning dates<br>\
picked up thence,] after the cutting off of the<br>\
dates: (TA:) IAth says, that ↓ لُقَطَةٌ, with<br>\
damm to the ل and fet-h to the ق, is often<br>\
mentioned in trads., and signifies property which<br>\
is found: (TA:) Az says, that لُقَطَةٌ, with fet-h<br>\
to the ق, signifies a thing which one finds<br>\
dropped, or thrown down, and takes; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) and that all the lexicologists and skilful grammarians say so; (Msb;) and in like<br>\
manner, A &#39;Obeyd, on the authority of As and of<br>\
El-Ahmar; (TA;) only Lth, of all whom he<br>\
has heard, saying that it is ↓ لُقْطَةٌ, with sukoon;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb;) and Fr: (TA:) IF and ElFárábee and others mention only ↓ لُقَطَةٌ; and<br>\
some reckon the pronunciation with sukoon as<br>\
an error of the vulgar; and the reason is this;<br>\
that the original word is ↓ لُقَاطَةٌ, which, in<br>\
consequence of its being in frequent use, as<br>\
applied to what is picked up in plundering, is<br>\
contracted, sometimes, by the elision of the ة,<br>\
into ↓ لُقَاطٌ, and sometimes, by the elision of the<br>\
ا into ↓ لُقَطَةٌ; and if they made the ق quiescent,<br>\
there would be two alterations in the word, and<br>\
such double alteration does not exist in chaste<br>\
language: (Msb:) IB, however, says that<br>\
↓ لُقْطَةٌ is correct; and he approves it; because<br>\
فُعْلَةٌ has the sense of a pass. part. n., as in the<br>\
instance of ضُحْكَةٌ; and فُعَلَةٌ has the sense of an<br>\
act. part. n., as in the instance of ضُحَكَةٌ; and<br>\
that it occurs in poetry: and IAth observes,<br>\
that some say thus; but that ↓ لُقَطَةٌ is more<br>\
common and more correct. (TA.) Anything<br>\
that is scattered, of ears of corn, or of fruit;<br>\
n. un. with ة: (TA:) what is picked up, or<br>\
taken from the ground, (S, Msb, K,) by men,<br>\
(S,) of ears of corn; (S, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ لُقَاطٌ, with damm: (S:) and ↓ لَقَاطٌ, like سَحَابٌ,<br>\
the ears of corn which the reaping-hooks miss,<br>\
(AHn, K,) and which men pick up. (AHn.)<br>\
What is picked up from a mine: (Msb:) pieces<br>\
of gold found in a mine; (K;) or such are<br>\
termed لَقَطُ مَعْدِنٍ: (S:) or لَقَطٌ signifies pieces<br>\
of gold, or of silver, like what are termed شَذْر,<br>\
and larger, in mines; which are the best thereof:<br>\
and one says ذَهَبٌ لَقَطٌ: (Lth:) and ↓ مُلْتَقَطٌ,<br>\
also, signifies gold found in a mine. (TA.)<br>\
You say also, فِى هٰذَا المَكَانِ لَقَطٌ مِنَ المَرْتَعِ<br>\
In this place is some small quantity of pasturage.<br>\
(S.) And فِى الأَرْضِ لَقَطٌ لِلْمَالِ In the land is<br>\
pasturage not much in quantity for the beasts.<br>\
(TA.) The pl. is أَلْقَاطٌ. (TA.)<br>\
لُقْطَةٌ: see لَقَطٌ, throughout the first sentence.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to Lth, it [also] signifies A man who<br>\
repeatedly and perseveringly seeks after things<br>\
to be picked up, and picks them up: (TA:) and<br>\
some say, that ↓ لُقَطَةٌ signifies one who picks up:<br>\
but the more common and correct signification<br>\
of this latter is “ property which is found,” as<br>\
before stated. (IAth.)<br>\
لُقَطَةٌ: see لَقَطٌ, throughout the first sentence: —<br>\
and see لُقْطَةٌ.<br>\
لَقَاطٌ: see لَقَطٌ, in the latter part of the paragraph.<br>\
لُقَاطٌ: see لَقَطٌ, in three places.<br>\
لِقَاطٌ: see 3. ―<br>\
-b2-  [The act of picking up the<br>\
ears of corn which the reaping-hooks miss;] the<br>\
act denoted in the explanation of لَقَاطٌ. (JK, K,<br>\
TA.) You say, هُوَ يَتَعَيَّشُ بِالِلّقَاطِ عَنِ اللَّقَاطِ<br>\
[He constrains himself to obtain the means of<br>\
life, or he obtains what is barely sufficient for<br>\
his sustenance, by picking up, or gleaning, from<br>\
the ears of corn which the reaping-hooks<br>\
have missed]. (TK: but there given without<br>\
any syll. signs.) [If the reading intended be<br>\
بِاللَّقَاطِ عَنِ اللِّقَاطِ, the meaning of لِقَاطٌ is The<br>\
act of missing ears of corn with the reapinghook; as is implied in the K, where لَقَاطٌ is<br>\
imperfectly explained: but this I think improbable.] لَقَاطٌ and لِقَاطٌ are [respectively] like<br>\
حَصَادٌ [as signifying what is “ reaped ”] and حِصَادٌ<br>\
[as signifying the act of “ reaping ”]. (TA.)<br>\
لَقِيطٌ i. q. ↓ مَلْقُوطٌ; (Msb, K;) i. e. A thing<br>\
that is picked up, taken up, raised, (Mgh,) or<br>\
taken, (Msb, K,) from the ground, (Mgh, K,)<br>\
or from a place where it was not thought to be.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, generally, (Mgh,) A foundling;<br>\
or child that is cast out, (Az, S, Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
and found by a man, (Az, TA,) or picked up;<br>\
(S;) or because it is cast out with the object of<br>\
its being picked up: (Mgh:) not what Lth<br>\
asserts it to be; i. e. a child that is cast out in<br>\
the roads, and there found, whose father and<br>\
mother are unknown: of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the<br>\
sense of the measure مَفْعُولٌ: (Az, TA:) and<br>\
↓ مَلْقُوطٌ signifies the same: (K:) [pl. of the<br>\
former, لُقَطَآءُ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, A well upon which one<br>\
lights unexpectedly, or unawares, (Lth, K,) without seeking it. (Lth.)<br>\
لُقَاطَةٌ: see لَقَطٌ, first sentence, in four places.<br>\
لَقِيطَةٌ applied to a man, and to a woman,<br>\
(tropical:)  Low, ignoble, base, vile, or mean; (K, TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ لَاقِطَةٌ applied to a man; (TA;) and<br>\
so ↓ سَاقِطٌ مَاقِطٌ لَاقِطٌ, used together. (L in art.<br>\
سقط.) It occurs in this sense preceded by<br>\
سَقِيطَةٌ; but you say سَقِيطٌ when alone. (TA.)<br>\
لَقَّاطٌ: see لَاقِطٌ.<br>\
لَقَّاطَةٌ: see لَاقِطٌ.<br>\
لَاقِطٌ and in an intensive sense ↓ لَقَّاطٌ and [in a<br>\
doubly intensive sense] ↓ لَقَّاطَةٌ A man [who<br>\
picks up things from the ground; and the second,<br>\
who does so much, or often; and the third, who<br>\
does so very much, or very often: or] who takes<br>\
things from places where they were not thought to<br>\
be: (Msb:) and all signify a man who picks up<br>\
the ears of corn [that fall] when the crop is<br>\
reaped, and [the fruit that falls] when the ripe<br>\
dates are cut from the raceme: (TA:) and the<br>\
first and second, a bird that picks up grains.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ↓ لِكُلِّ سَاقِطَةٍ لَاقِطَةٌ For every saying<br>\
that falls from one, there is a person who will<br>\
take it up: (Msb in art. سقط:) or for every<br>\
word that falls from the mouth of the speaker,<br>\
there is a person who will hear it and pick it up<br>\
and publish it: (S, * K:) a proverb, (TA,)<br>\
relating to the guarding of the tongue: (K:)<br>\
the ة in لاقطة is to give intensiveness to the<br>\
meaning, (Msb, in art. سقط,) or for the purpose<br>\
of assimilation: (Msb in that art., and in the<br>\
present one:) if you say لِكُلِّ ضَائِعٍ, or the like,<br>\
you say لَاقِطٌ. (Msb in the present art.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
الحَصَى ↓ لَاقِطَةٌ The قَانِصَة [meaning stomach,<br>\
&amp;c.,] of a bird, (S, K,) in which pebbles become<br>\
collected: (S:) or the omasum (قِبّة) of a sheep<br>\
or goat [and the corresponding ventricle of a<br>\
camel, as is shown in the TA in art. حصل; also<br>\
called لَقَّاطَةُ الحَصَى (see قُرَيْحَآءُ);] because it<br>\
conveys thereinto whatever it eats of earth and<br>\
pebbles; (A, TA;) as also اللَّاقِطَةٌ [alone].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  لَاقِطٌ also signifies (tropical:)  Any freedman, or<br>\
emancipated slave: (K:) or the slave of a freedman. (S in art. مقط, and TA in art. سقط:) the<br>\
slave of the لاقط is called مَاقِطٌ; and the slave<br>\
of the ماقط is called سَاقِطٌ: and hence the<br>\
saying, هُوَ سَاقِطُ بْنُ مَاقِطِ بْنِ لَاقِطٍ. (K, TA [but<br>\
in the CK, for هُوَ we find بَنُو, with the necessary<br>\
difference in what follows it.]) See art. سقط.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also لَقِيطَةٌ: and see أَلْقَاطٌ, which may be<br>\
a pl. of لَاقِطٌ; as in لُقَّاطٌ, which is explained with<br>\
أَلْقَاطٌ.<br>\
لَاقِطَةٌ: see لَاقِطٌ, in two places:<br>\
-A2-  and see also<br>\
لَقِيطَةٌ.<br>\
أَلْقَاطٌ pl. of لَقَطٌ, q. v. ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  A small number of<br>\
men, separated, or scattered, or dispersed. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[Also, perhaps as pl. of لَاقِطٌ, like as أَصْحَابٌ is pl.<br>\
of صَاحِبٌ,] (tropical:)  The refuse, or lowest, or basest, or<br>\
meanest sort, of mankind, or of people; (K, * TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ لُقَّاطٌ [which is doubtless a pl. of لَاقِطٌ,<br>\
like as سُقَّاطٍ is of سَاقِطٌ, and مُقَّاطٌ of مَاقِطٌ]. (IAar,<br>\
in TA, art. خشر.)<br>\
مَلْقَطٌ [A place where a thing is picked up:]<br>\
a place where a thing is sought, or to be sought:<br>\
a mine: (TA:) [pl. مَلاقِطُ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  أَصْبَحَتْ مَرَاعِينَا<br>\
مَلَاقِطَ مِنَ الجَدْبِ Our places of pasturage became<br>\
dried up, and destitute of herbage, by reason of<br>\
the drought. (As.)<br>\
مِلْقَطٌ A thing with which, (K,) or in which,<br>\
(Jm,) one picks up, or takes up, from the ground:<br>\
(Jm, K;) as also ↓ مِلْقَاطٌ. (TA.)<br>\
مِلْقَاطٌ: see مِلْقَطٌ. ―<br>\

مِنْقَاش, (K, TA,) with which hair is plucked up.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَلْقُوطٌ: see لَقِيطٌ, in two places. IAth explains<br>\
مَالٌ مَلْقُوطٌ as signifying property found. (TA.)<br>\
مُلْتَقَطٌ: see لَقَطٌ, last sentence but two. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
applied to a thing, i. q. سَاقِطٌ (assumed tropical:)  [Vile, mean, or<br>\
paltry]. (TA.)<br>\
