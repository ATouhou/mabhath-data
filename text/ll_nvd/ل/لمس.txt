لَمَسَهُ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
لَمُسَ (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K) and<br>\
لَمِسَ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. لَمْسٌ, (S,<br>\
M, Msb,) He felt it; or touched it; syn. مَسَّهُ:<br>\
(IAar, Az, IDrd, El-Fárábee, A, Msb, TA:)<br>\
or he felt it, or touched it, (مَسَّهُ,) with his hand:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) or he put his hand to it: (Msb:)<br>\
or he felt it with his hand for the purpose of<br>\
testing it, that he might form a judgment of it;<br>\
syn. جَسَّهُ: (M, TA:) and ↓ لَامَسَهُ is syn. with<br>\
لَمَسَهُ, (M, TA,) or مَاسَّهُ: (A:) لَمْسٌ and مَسٌّ<br>\
both signify the perceiving by means of the exterior of the external skin: (Er-Rághib, TA:)<br>\
or they are nearly alike: (TA:) [generally, like<br>\
the English words feeling and touching, respectively:] or the former is, originally, [the<br>\
feeling] with the hand for the purpose of knowing<br>\
the feel (مَسّ) of a thing: (IDrd, Msb:) or,<br>\
with the hand, it is the seeking for [or feeling<br>\
for] a thing here and there: (Lth, TA:)<br>\
مُلَامَسَةٌ is the same as مُمَاسَّةٌ (K, TA) with the<br>\
hand; as also لَمْسٌ: (TA:) or a distinction is<br>\
to be made between them; for it is said that<br>\
لَمْسٌ is sometimes the feeling, or touching a<br>\
thing with a thing; and is sometimes [for] the<br>\
knowledge of a thing, though there be no touching (مَسّ) of substance upon substance; whereas<br>\
ملامسة is mostly mutual feeling or touching, &amp;c.,<br>\
being] the act of two. (IAar in TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] لَمَسَهَا, (M, A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
لَمُسَ (M)<br>\
[and<br>\
لَمِسَ, as implied in the K], inf. n. لَمْسٌ,<br>\
(S, M,) (tropical:)  Inivit eam; (I&#39;Ab, S, M, A, Msb, K;)<br>\
scil. mulierem; (A, Msb;) puellam; (K;) as also<br>\
↓ لَامَسَهَا, (M, A, Msb,) inf. n. مُلَامَسَةٌ (I&#39;Ab, S,<br>\
Msb, K) and لِمَاسٌ: (I&#39;Ab, Msb:) and (assumed tropical:)  he<br>\
kissed her; by doing which, as well as by the<br>\
former, one renders necessary the performance of<br>\
the ablution termed وضوء. (&#39;Abd-Allah Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Amr, Ibn-Mes&#39;ood.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] لَمَسَهُ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
لَمُسَ [and<br>\
لَمِسَ], (A, TA,) inf. n. لَمْسٌ, (IDrd,<br>\
Msb, TA,) (tropical:)  He sought, [as though by feeling,]<br>\
or sought for or after, it, namely, a thing,<br>\
(IDrd, Msb, TA,) in any manner; (IDrd,<br>\
Msb;) [as, for instance, by asking, or demanding;] as also ↓ التمسهُ, (S, M, A, * K, TA,)<br>\
[which is more common,] and ↓ تلمّسهُ: (M,<br>\
TA:) or this last signifies he sought it, or sought<br>\
for or after it, repeatedly, or time after time.<br>\
(S, K, TA.) You say, أُلْمُسْ لِى فُلَانًا (A, TA)<br>\
(tropical:)  Seek thou for me such a one. (TA.) And it<br>\
is said in the Kur, [lxxii. 8,] relating the words<br>\
of the jinn, or genii, إِنَّا لَمَسْنَا السَّمَآءَ, (K, * TA, *)<br>\
(tropical:)  Verily we sought to reach heaven: or to learn<br>\
the news thereof: (Bd:) or to hear by stealth<br>\
what was said therein: (Jel:) or we laboured, or<br>\
strove, after (عَالَجْنَا) the secrets of heaven, and<br>\
sought to hear them by stealth. (K.) And in a<br>\
trad., بِهِ عِلْمًا ↓ مَنْ سَلَكَ طَرِيقًا يَلْتَمِسُ (tropical:)  Whoso<br>\
pursueth a way whereby he seeketh after knowledge, or science. (TA.) And in another, of<br>\
&#39;Áïsheh, عِقْدِى ↓ فَالْتَمَسْتُ (tropical:)  And I sought for<br>\
my necklace. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  لَمَسَ البَصَرَ, aor.<br>\
لَمُسَ, (tropical:)  It<br>\
took away the sight. (A, TA.) And the same,<br>\
or, accord. to one relation of a trad., ↓ التمسهُ, (assumed tropical:)  It<br>\
took away quickly, and destroyed, the sight; said<br>\
there of certain serpents: or the meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  it<br>\
aimed at the eye with its bite: and لَمَسَ عَيْنَهُ is<br>\
said to signify [(assumed tropical:)  he, or it, put out his eye,] the<br>\
same as سَمَلَ. (TA.)<br>\

لامسهُ, inf. n. مُلَامَسَةٌ and لِمَاسٌ: for its<br>\
proper signification, see 1, in three places.<br>\
[Hence,] بَيْعُ المُلَامَسَةِ, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
and بَيْعُ اللِّمَاسِ, (Mgh,) or المُلَامَسَةُ فِى البَيْعِ,<br>\
(K,) A mode of bargaining, which consists in<br>\
saying, When thou feelest, or touchest, my garment, or I feel, or touch, thy garment, (A, K,)<br>\
or when, (Mgh,) or if, (Msb,) I feel, or touch,<br>\
thy garment, and thou feelest, or touchest, my<br>\
garment, (Mgh, Msb,) or when I feel, or touch,<br>\
the thing to be sold, (S,) the sale is binding, or<br>\
settled, or concluded, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) between us, (S, Msb,) for such a sum: (S, Msb,<br>\
K:) or, accord. to Aboo-Haneefeh, in thy saying, I will sell to thee this commodity for such a<br>\
sum, and when I feel, or touch, thee, the sale is<br>\
binding, or settled, or concluded; or in the purchaser&#39;s saying the like: (Mgh:) or, (M, Mgh,<br>\
K,) as in the Sunan of Aboo-Dáwood, (Mgh,)<br>\
in purchasing a commodity on the condition of<br>\
feeling it (M, Mgh, * K, *) behind a garment or<br>\
piece of cloth, (K,) without seeing it, (M, K,) or<br>\
spreading it out and turning it over and examining it: (Mgh:) or on the condition that the<br>\
feeling it with the hand shall cut one off from the<br>\
choice of returning it: (TA:) the mode of bargaining thus termed is forbidden. (S, M, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb.) ―<br>\

verb, see 1.<br>\

أَلْمِسْنِى الجَارِيَةَ Permit thou me to feel, or<br>\
touch, the girl. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَلْمِسْنِى امْرَأَْةً<br>\
(tropical:)  Marry thou to me a woman. (A, TA.)<br>\

إِلْتَمَسَ see 1, in four places.<br>\
لَمُوسٌ A she-camel of whose fatness one doubts;<br>\
(O, TS, K;) on the authority of Ibn-&#39;Abbád;<br>\
(TA;) i. q. شَكُوكٌ and ضَبُوثٌ: (A, TA:) or of<br>\
whose hump one doubts, whether there be in her<br>\
fat or not; wherefore it is felt: (M, L:) pl.<br>\
لُمُسٌ. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] (tropical:)  One whose origin,<br>\
or lineage, is suspected; syn. دَعِىٌّ: (K:) or in<br>\
whose grounds of pretention to respect is a fault,<br>\
or taint. (A, K.)<br>\
لَمِيسٌ A woman soft to the feel, or touch;<br>\
لَيِّنَةُ المَلْمَسِ. (K.)<br>\
لَمَاسَةٌ, (M,) لُمَاسَةٌ, (S,) or both, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
want: (IAar, Sgh:) or a moderate, or middling,<br>\
want. (S, M, O, L.)<br>\
لَمُوسَةٌ A road, or way: so called because he<br>\
who has lost his way seeks it in order to find the<br>\
track of the travellers. (K, * TA.)<br>\
لَامِسٌ act. part. n. of 1. (Msb, &amp;c.) One says,<br>\
of a woman who commits adultery, or fornication, or acts viciously, فَلَانَةُ لَا تَرُدُّ يَدَ لَامِسٍ,<br>\
(A, TA,) or لَا تَمْنَعُ يَدَ لَامِسٍ, (K,) but the<br>\
latter is at variance with the written authorities,<br>\
the former being the phrase commonly known,<br>\
(TA,) [properly signifying, Such a woman does<br>\
not repel the hand of a feeler;] meaning, (tropical:)  such<br>\
a woman commits adultery, or fornication, and<br>\
acts viciously, (K, TA,) not repelling from herself any one who desires of her that he may lie<br>\
with her; (TA;) and she is suspected of easiness,<br>\
or compliance, (K, TA,) towards him who desires<br>\
of her that he may lie with her: (TA:) or the<br>\
meaning is, such a woman gives, of her husband&#39;s<br>\
property, what is sought, or demanded, from<br>\
her; and this is more probably meant in a trad.<br>\
in which a man is related to have said thus of<br>\
his wife; because Mohammad directed him to<br>\
retain her, and did not require him to divorce<br>\
her. (TA.) The like said of a man, (K,)<br>\
فُلَانٌ لَا يَرُدُّ يَدَ لَامِسٍ, (A, Msb,) means, (tropical:)  Such a<br>\
man has in him no force of resistance, (A, Msb,<br>\
K,) nor care of what is sacred, or inviolable.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مَلْمَسٌ [A place that is felt, or touched: and it<br>\
may also be an inf. n.: see لَمِيسٌ]. (K.)<br>\
إِكَافٌ مَلْمُوسُ الأَحْنَآءِ (tropical:)  An ass&#39;s saddle, or pad,<br>\
of which the curved pieces of wood have been felt<br>\
with the hands until they have become even:<br>\
(M:) or of which any unevenness and prominence that was therein has been pared off (Lth,<br>\
T, A, K) by the passing of the hand over it,<br>\
(Lth, T,) or of the hands. (A.)<br>\
