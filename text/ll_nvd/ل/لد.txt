another augmentative letter: (IJ, L:) the dim.<br>\
of ↓ أَلنْدَدٌ is ↓ أُلَيْدُّ, because it is originally أَلَدُّ,<br>\
the ن being added to render it quasi-coördinate<br>\

[xix. 97,] is said to signify A people who are<br>\
adversaries perverted from the truth: or, who<br>\
are deaf to the truth. (L.) You say also,<br>\
