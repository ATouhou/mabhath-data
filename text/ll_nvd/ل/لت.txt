لُتَاتٌ What is crumbled, or broken into small<br>\
pieces, with the fingers, (مَا فُتَّ,) of the barks of<br>\

of the dry, outer bark: but Az says, I know not<br>\
whether it be لِتَاتٌ or لُتَاتٌ. (TA.) Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee<br>\

اللَّاتُّ, occurring in the Kur [liii. 19,] (TA,)<br>\
so accord. to the reading of Ibn-&#39;Abbás and<br>\
&#39;Ikrimeh and some others, (K,) and so originally<br>\
accord. to Fr.: (TA:) afterwards contracted<br>\
into اللَّاتُ: (Fr, K:) which is the common<br>\
reading: (Fr:) A certain idol; thus called by<br>\
the appellation of a man who used to moisten<br>\
سَوِيق with clarified butter at the place thereof:<br>\
(K:) the man who did this was thus called, and<br>\
afterwards the idol itself. (TA.) Some of the<br>\
lexicologists say, that it was a mass of rock, at<br>\
the place whereof was a man who used to moisten<br>\
سويق for the pilgrims, and which, when he died,<br>\
was worshipped: (L:) but ISd says, I know<br>\
not what is the truth in this case. (TA.) In<br>\
the R it is said, that the man who used to do<br>\
this was &#39;Amr Ibn-Lu-eí; that when the tribe of<br>\
Khuzá&#39;ah obtained the dominion over Mekkeh,<br>\
and banished the tribe of Jurhum, the Arabs<br>\
made him a Lord, or an object of worship; and<br>\
that he was El-Látt, who used to moisten سويق<br>\
for the pilgrims upon a well-known rock, called<br>\
صخْرَةُ اللَّاتِّ: or, it is said, that the man in<br>\
question was of the tribe of Thakeef; and that<br>\
when he died, &#39;Amr Ibn-Loheí (لحى: so in the<br>\
TA) said to the people, “He hath not died, but<br>\
hath entered the rock: ” and ordered them to<br>\
worship it, and built over it a house called اللات:<br>\
it is also said to have continued thus during the<br>\
life of this man and that of his son, for three<br>\
hundred years: then that rock was named اللَّاتُ,<br>\
without teshdeed to the ت, and was taken for an<br>\
idol, to be worshipped. (TA.) It is disputed<br>\
whether it were [an idol] of the tribe of Thakeef<br>\
at Et-Táïf, or of the tribe of Kureysh at En-Nakhleh. (MF.) Some say, that the ت is<br>\
originally without teshdeed, and to denote the<br>\
fem. gender: Ks used to pronounce the word in<br>\
a case of pause اللَّاهْ; and Aboo-Is-hák [Zj]<br>\
says, that this is agreeable with analogy; but<br>\
that the more approved mode is to pronounce it<br>\
in such case with ت. AM says, that the manner<br>\
in which Ks pronounced it in a case of pause<br>\
shows that he did not derive it from لَتٌّ. The<br>\
polytheists who worshipped this idol used to<br>\
compare its name with the name of اللّٰه. It is<br>\
also said, that اللَّاتُ, without teshdeed, is of the<br>\
measure فَعَلَةٌ [originally اللَّوَيَةُ] from the root<br>\
لوى; [and that the said idol was so called]<br>\
because they used to compass it, or perform<br>\
circuits round it. (TA.) [See art. لوى: and<br>\
see also arts. لوه and ليه: and الرَّبَّةُ, in art رب.]<br>\
