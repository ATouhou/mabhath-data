لَقِحَتْ, (S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
لَقَحَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. لَقَحٌ (S, Msb, K,) and لَقْحٌ (K) and لَقَاحٌ;<br>\
(S, K;) and لُقِحَتْ بِالْوَلَدِ, in the pass. form;<br>\
(Msb;) She (a camel) conceived, or became pregnant; (Msb, TA;) received [into her womb]<br>\
the seed of the stallion. (K.) ―<br>\

لَقَحٌ, syn. حَبَلٌ, K, TA: in the CK<br>\
جَبَلٌ:) (tropical:)  She (a woman) conceived, or became<br>\
pregnant. (Sh, T, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اِمْرَأَةٌ سَرِيعَةُ اللَّقَحِ A<br>\
woman quick in conceiving, or becoming pregnant.<br>\
The like is said with respect to any female.<br>\
Perhaps the word thus used has this signification<br>\
properly, or perhaps tropically. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  أَسَرَّتْ<br>\
لَقَحًا, and لَقَاحًا, She (a camel) concealed her<br>\
having conceived, or become pregnant: i. e., she<br>\
did not show signs of her having conceived by<br>\
raising her tail and elevating her nose. (L.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
لَقِحَتِ النَّخِيلُ, or لُقِحَت, (as in different copies<br>\
of the S,) (tropical:)  [The palm-trees became fecundated<br>\
by the process termed إِلْقَاحٌ: see 4]: and of a<br>\
single palm-tree (نَخْلَةٌ) you say لَقِحَتْ, or<br>\
لُقِحَتْ, without teshdeed; (so, again, in different<br>\
copies of the S;) and ↓ تَلَقَّحَتْ. (S, art. أبر) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
لَقِحَ العِجَافُ, inf. n. لَقَحٌ, (tropical:)  The lands in which<br>\
was no good became fecundated. (L.) [See also<br>\
أَعْجَفُ.] ―<br>\
-b7-  لَقِحَتِ الحَرْبُ: see a verse cited<br>\
voce عن.<br>\
2<br>\
لَقَّحَ see 4.<br>\
4<br>\
القح الفَحْلُ النَّاقَةَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. إِلْقَاحٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) and ↓ لقّحها, (A,) [inf. n. تَلْقِيحٌ;] The<br>\
stallion-camel made the she-camel to conceive, or<br>\
become pregnant; impregnated her; got her with<br>\
young. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  القح النَّخْلَةَ, inf. n. إِلْقَاحٌ,<br>\
[and quasi-inf. n. لَقَاحٌ, q. v.; et vide infra;] and<br>\
↓ لقّحها, inf. n. تَلْقِيحٌ; (S, Msb, A, K;) and<br>\
↓ لَقَحَهَا, inf. n. لَقْحٌ; (K;) (tropical:)  He fecundated the<br>\
palm-tree by means of the ↓ لَقَاح, or spadix of<br>\
the male tree, which is bruised, or brayed, and<br>\
sprinkled [upon the spadix of the female]: (A:)<br>\
or, by inserting a stalk of a raceme of the male<br>\
tree into the spathe [of the female, after shaking<br>\
off the pollen of the former upon the spadix of the<br>\
female; for such is the general practice]: this is<br>\
done in the following manner: you leave the<br>\
spathe of the [female] palm-tree two or three<br>\
nights after its bursting open: then you take a<br>\
stalk of a raceme of the male tree, which is best<br>\
if old, of the preceding year, and insert it into<br>\
the spadix [of the female, after shaking off the<br>\
pollen, as above mentioned]; and this you do<br>\
according to a certain measure: it should not be<br>\
done but by a man acquainted with the manner<br>\
of proceeding in this case; for if he be ignorant,<br>\
and do too much, he turns the spathe, and mars<br>\
it; and if he do too little, many of the dates produced will be without stones; and if he do it not<br>\
at all to the palm-tree, he will derive no advantage from the spadix thereof that year: (L:)<br>\
↓ لَقَحٌ is the name of that which is taken from the<br>\
male palm-tree (الفُحَّال: so in the L: in the K,<br>\
الفَحْل:) to be inserted in the other, [namely the<br>\
spathe of the female]. (L, K.) [See also لَقَاحٌ.<br>\
In the CK, for إِسْمُ مَا أُخِذَ الخ, we find اسم ماءٍ<br>\
اخذ الخ, giving a different and false meaning.]<br>\
جَآءَنَا زَمَنُ اللَّقَاحِ, or ↓ التَّلْقِيحِ, The time of the<br>\
fecundating of the palm-trees has come to us.<br>\

-b3-  أَلْقَحَتِ الرِّيحُ السَّحَابَ (S) (tropical:)  The wind<br>\
impregnated, or fecundated, the cloud, or clouds;<br>\

the like]. (TA.) ―<br>\

became experienced in affairs, and they fecundated<br>\
his intellect]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b6-  النَّظَرُ فِى عَوَاقِبِ الْأُموُرِ<br>\
الْعُقُولِ ↓ تَلْقِيحُ (tropical:)  [Consideration of the results, or<br>\
issues, of things is (a means of) fecundation of<br>\
the intellects]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b7-  لَا تُلْقِحْ سِلْعَتَكَ بِالأَيْمَانِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Make not thy merchandise productive of a high<br>\
price by means of oaths]. (A.)<br>\
5<br>\
تلقّحت She (a camel) pretended that she<br>\
had conceived, or become pregnant, (by raising<br>\
her tail, in order that the stallion might not<br>\
approach her, TA,) when this was not really the<br>\
case. (Fr, S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See 1.<br>\
10<br>\
استلقحت النَّخْلَةُ (tropical:)  The palm-tree attained<br>\
to the proper period for its being fecundated by<br>\
the process termed إِلْقَاحٌ: [see 4: or required to<br>\
be so fecundated]. (K.)<br>\

-b2-  see أَلْقَحَ النَّخْلَةَ, and<br>\
see لَقَاحٌ.<br>\
لَقْحَةٌ: see لِقْحَةٌ and لَقُوحٌ.<br>\
لِقْحَةٌ (K) and ↓ لَقْحَةٌ (TA) (assumed tropical:)  A woman suckling; or a woman who suckles. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
لَقُوحٌ.<br>\
لَقَاحٌ (tropical:)  The thing [namely flowers or pollen]<br>\
with which a female palm-tree is fecundated, (S,<br>\
L, K,) taken from a male palm-tree; (L;) the<br>\
spadix of a male palm-tree, (A, K,) with which<br>\
a female palm-tree is fecundated, it being bruised,<br>\
or brayed, and sprinkled [upon the spadix of the<br>\
female]. (A.) [See also لَقَحٌ, voce أَلْقَحَ, and لِقَاحٌ]<br>\
-A2-  حَىٌّ لَقَاحٌ A tribe that does not submit to kings,<br>\
(S, K,) and that has not been governed by a<br>\
king: (L:) or, that has not suffered captivity in<br>\
the time of paganism. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See 1.<br>\
لِقَاحٌ The semen genitale (L, K) of a stallion<br>\
camel, and horse, and (tropical:)  of a man. (L.) I&#39;Ab,<br>\
being asked respecting a man who had two<br>\
wives, one of whom suckled a boy, and the other<br>\
a girl, [not his own children,] whether the boy<br>\
might marry the girl, answered “ No; because<br>\
the لقاح [i. e., لِقَاح or ↓ لَقَاح, as shown below,] is<br>\
one: ” meaning, says Lth, that the semen<br>\
genitale which impregnated them both, and<br>\
which was the source of the milk of both, was<br>\
one, and that the two sucklings had thus become<br>\
as though they were the children of the two<br>\
women&#39;s husband: but, says Az, لقاح may here<br>\
be a quasi-inf. n., syn. with إِلْقَاحٌ; like عَطَآءٌ and<br>\
إِعْطَآءٌ &amp;c.: (L:) [and the like is said in the Msb.]<br>\
↓ لَقَاحٌ and لِقَاحٌ, with fet-h and kesr, are substs.<br>\
from أَلْقَحَ, [q. v.] syn. with إِلْقَاحٌ, signifying<br>\
impregnation, or the getting with young; and<br>\
so in the answer of I&#39;Ab above mentioned.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
لَقُوحٌ A camel (S, K) itself: (S:) pl. لِقَاحٌ.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See لَاقِحٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  لَقُوحٌ and ↓ لِقْحَةٌ (S,<br>\
Msb, K) and ↓ لَقْحَةٌ, (Msb, K,) applied to a<br>\
she-camel, i. q. حَلُوبٌ [meaning Milch, and a<br>\
milch camel]: (S, Msb, K:) but Az says, that<br>\
the former only is used as an epithet; you say<br>\
ناقة لَقُوحٌ, and not ناقةٌ لِقْحَةٌ, but هٰذِهِ لِقْحَةٌ فُلَانٍ:<br>\
(TA:) or لَقُوحٌ is [an epithet] applied to a she-camel during the first two or three months after<br>\
her having brought forth; and after this she is<br>\
termed لَبُونٌ: (AA, S, K:) and accord. to some,<br>\
↓ لِقْحَةٌ signifies a milch camel abounding with<br>\
milk: or a she-camel from the time when the<br>\
hump of her young one becomes fat, until the<br>\
expiration of seven months, when she weans her<br>\
young one, and this she does at the [auroral]<br>\
rising of Canopus: (TA:) [which rising, in<br>\
central Arabia, about the commencement of the<br>\
era of the Flight was between the 30th of July<br>\
and the 12th of August:] also ↓ لِقْحَةٌ and<br>\
↓ لَقْحَةٌ a she-camel that has lately brought forth:<br>\
(L:) pl. of لَقُوحٌ, لِقَاحٌ (S, Msb, K) and لَقَائِحُ;<br>\
(ISh;) and pl. of ↓ لِقْحَةٌ (and of ↓ لَقْحَةٌ, K,<br>\
TA,) لِقَحٌ (S, Msb, K) and لِقَاحٌ. (ISh, Th,<br>\
Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  The Arabs also said لِقَاحَانِ أَسْوَدَانِ<br>\
[Two black herds of milch camels], like as they<br>\
said قَطِيعَانِ; for they said لِقَاحٌ وَاحِدَةٌ in like<br>\
manner as they said قَطِيعٌ وَاحِدٌ and إِبِلٌ وَاحِدَةٌ.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b5-  المُسْلِمِينَ ↓ أَدِرُّوا لِقْحَةَ (tropical:)  Milk ye the<br>\
milch camel of the Muslims: occurring in a trad.,<br>\
alluding to the tribute (فَىْء and خَرَاج) whence<br>\
were derived the stipends and fixed appointments<br>\
of the persons addressed, and to the collecting it<br>\
with equity. (TA.)<br>\
لَقَّاحٌ A fecundator of palm-trees. (Az, TA in<br>\
art. جنى.)<br>\
لاقِحٌ (IAar, S, K) and ↓ لَقُوحٌ (K) and<br>\
↓ مَلْقُوحَةٌ (Msb) A she-camel having just conceived, or become pregnant; (IAar, K;) as also<br>\
قَارِحٌ: afterwards, when her pregnancy has<br>\
become manifestly apparent, she is termed خَلِفَةٌ:<br>\
(IAar:) pl. of the former لَوَاقِحُ (K) and لُقَّحٌ;<br>\
(TA;) and of the second, لُقُحٌ. (L, K, TA: in<br>\
the CK لُقَّحٌ.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رِيَاحٌ لَوَاقِحُ (S, K, &amp;c.,)<br>\
(tropical:)  Pregnant winds; so called because they bear the<br>\
water and the clouds, and turn the latter over<br>\
and about, and then cause them to send down<br>\
rain; (TA;) or because they become pregnant,<br>\
and then impregnate the clouds: (IJ:) the sing. is<br>\
رِيحٌ لَاقِحٌ, the contr. of which is termed رِيحٌ<br>\
عَقِيمٌ [or “ a barren wind ”]: (ISd:) or ريح<br>\
لاقح signifies ذَاتُ لَقَلَاحٍ [possessing that which<br>\
impregnates]; like as دِرْهَمٌ وَازِنٌ signifies ذُو وَزْنِ;<br>\
رَجُلٌ رَامِحٌ, ذُو رُمْحٍ: (AHeyth:) or رياح لواقح<br>\
signifies impregnating, or fecundating, winds;<br>\
(S, K;) as also ↓ مَلَاقِحُ [pl. of مُلْقِحَةٌ]: (K:)<br>\
or it is not allowable to say مَلَاقِحُ; (S;) but<br>\
this is the regular form of the word; because the<br>\
wind impregnates the clouds; (IJ;) and thus<br>\
لواقح is extr.: or, as some say, the proper<br>\
original word is مُلْقِحَةٌ; but the winds do not<br>\
impregnate unless they are themselves pregnant;<br>\
as though they were pregnant with good,<br>\
and, when they raised the clouds, transmitted to them that good. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  حَرْبٌ لَاقِحٌ<br>\
(K) (tropical:)  War pregnant [with great events.] (TA.)<br>\
مُلْقِحٌ A stallion camel: pl. مَلَاقِحُ. (S, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See لَاقِحٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  (tropical:)  A man to whom offspring is<br>\
born. Occurring in a trad. (TA.)<br>\
مُلْقَحَةٌ A female camel that has her young one<br>\
in her belly: pl. مَلَاقِحُ: (S, K:) a pass. part. n.<br>\
from أَلْقَحَ. (Msb.)<br>\
مَلْقُوحَةٌ (IAar, S, K, &amp;c.) and مَلْقُوحٌ, (IAar,)<br>\
which latter is also used in a pl. sense, (As,)<br>\
What is in the belly of a she-camel: (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
T, S, K, &amp;c.:) or what is in the back of the<br>\
stallion camel; [meaning his progeny in the<br>\
elemental state;] (Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, K;) but the<br>\
former, says Az, is the correct signification:<br>\
(L:) مَلْقُوحَةٌ is for مَلْقُوحٌ بِهِ, converted into a<br>\
subst., (Msb,) from لُقِحَتْ, like مَحْمُومٌ from حُمَّ,<br>\
and مَجْنُونٌ from جُنَّ: (S:) pl. مَلَاقِيحُ.<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S, K, &amp;c.) The Muslims are forbidden to sell مَلَاقِيح and مَضَامِين. (L.) [See<br>\
the latter of these words.] ―<br>\
-b2-  المَلَاقِيحُ is also<br>\
used (sometimes, TA) to signify The mothers:<br>\
and its sing. is مَلْقُوحَةٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
