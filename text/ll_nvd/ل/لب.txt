لَبڤ3َ [لَبَّ, originally لَبِبَ,] sec. per. لَبِبْتَ, (S, K,)<br>\
the most common form of the verb, (TA,) and<br>\
[لَبَّ, originally لَبُبَ, like حَبَّ, originally حَبُبَ,<br>\
q. v.,] sec. pers. لَبُبْتَ, aor. يَلَبُّ, (S, K,) in the<br>\
dial. of El-Hijáz, deviating from rule as aor. of<br>\
the latter form of the verb; (TA;) inf. n. لَبَابَةٌ<br>\
(S, K) and لِبٌّ and لَبٌّ; (TA;) and لَبَّ, aor.<br>\
يَلِبُّ, in the dial. of Nejd; like فَرَّ, aor. يَفِرُّ;<br>\
(TA;) and [لَبَّ], sec. pers. لَبِبْتَ, aor. يَلُبُّ;<br>\
[contr. to analogy;] (Yz;) and [لَبَّ], sec. pers.<br>\
لَبُبْتَ, aor. يَلُبُّ; [agreeably with analogy;]<br>\
(Yoo;) He was, or became, possessed of لُبّ, i. e.,<br>\
understanding, intellect, or intelligence. See لُبٌّ.<br>\
(S, K.) It has been said by some (as the<br>\
authors of the T, the S, &amp;c.) that لَبُبْتَ, aor. تَلَبُّ,<br>\
has not its like among the class of reduplicative<br>\
verbs; i. e., in being of the measure فَعُلَ in the<br>\
pret., and يَفْعَلُ in the aor.: but three similar<br>\
verbs have been mentioned; namely, دَمُمْتَ,<br>\
شَرُرْتَ, and عَزُزَتِ الشَّاةُ (meaning “ the ewe, or<br>\
goat, became scant in her milk ”). (TA.) [This,<br>\
however, is a mistake: the assertion relates to<br>\
لَبُبْتَ having for its aor. (regularly) تَلُبُّ: see<br>\
دَمَّ, aor. يَدُمُّ.])<br>\
-A2-  لَبَّ, aor.<br>\

إِنَّا إِذَا الدَّاعِى اعْتَرَى وَلَبَّبَا<br>\
[Verily we, when a caller comes seeking a kind<br>\

here signifies تَرَدَّدَ: see above. (TA.) ―<br>\

-b2-  تلبّب He raised his<br>\
clothes, or tucked them up: (K:) he girded<br>\
himself, and raised, or tucked up, his clothes;<br>\
(S;) a signification assigned in the A to ↓ لَبَّبَ:<br>\

R. Q. 1<br>\
لَبْلَبَةٌ, [inf. n. of لَبْلَبَ,] The being<br>\
tender, affectionate, kind, or compassionate, to<br>\
offspring. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  لَبْلَبَتْ عَلَى وَلَدِهَا, inf. n.<br>\
as above, She (a ewe) was tender, or affectionate, to<br>\
her young one, and licked it, when she brought it<br>\
forth, (S, K,) making a sound like لِبْ لِبْ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  See 1. ―<br>\
-b4-  لَبْلَبَ عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. as above, He<br>\
was kind, or compassionate, to him; i. e., to a man:<br>\
he was kind, or affectionate, to him, and aided, or<br>\
succoured, him. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  لَبْلَبَ It was separated,<br>\
dispersed, or scattered. (AA, T, K.) (The inf. n.,<br>\
لبلبة, is explained by تَفَرُّقٌ: but I think it not<br>\
improbable that this is a mistake for تَرَفُّقٌ; and<br>\
that the meaning is, He was gentle, courteous,<br>\
or kind.]<br>\
لَبٌّ inf. n. of لَبَّ “ he remained, &amp;c. ” ―<br>\
-b2-  لبَّيْكَ<br>\
[At thy service! lit., Doubly at thy service!]<br>\
(S, K, &amp;c.) and لَبَّيْهِ [At his service: &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
[See an ex. voce مَرْهُوبٌ. It is used in the<br>\
present day like our phrase At thy service, and<br>\
may well be thus rendered, or with the addition<br>\
of time after time.] لبّيك is derived from أَلَبَّ<br>\
[or rather from لَبَّ as syn. with البّ] “ he<br>\
remained &amp;c. ”; and means I wait intent upon<br>\
thy service, or upon obedience to thee: (Fr,<br>\
S, K;) waiting [at they service] after waiting;<br>\
[i. e., time after time;] and answering [thy<br>\
commands] after answering: (K:) it [i. e. the<br>\
noun without the annexed pron.] is put in the<br>\
acc. case as an inf. n. [used as an absolute<br>\
complement of its own verb which is understood],<br>\
as in حَمْدًا لِلّٰهِ وشُكْرًا; and the right way would<br>\
be to say لَبًّا لَكَ; but it is put in the dual number<br>\
for the sake of corroboration; meaning إِلْبَابًا<br>\
بِكَ بَعْدَ إِلْبَابٍ, and إِقَامَةً بَعْدَ إِقَامَةٍ, [waiting at<br>\
thy service, or in attendance upon thee, or in thy<br>\
presence, after waiting, or time after time]. (Fr,<br>\
S.) [See also the similar expression سَعْدَيْكَ.]<br>\
Or لَبٌّ signifies the obeying, or serving; or<br>\
obedience, or service; from the original signification of the “ remaining, staying, abiding,<br>\
or dwelling,” [in a place]: the dual, in the nom.<br>\
case, is لَبّانِ; and in the acc. and gen., لَبَّيْنِ;<br>\
and the original meaning of لبيك is I have obeyed<br>\
thee, or served thee, twice: [or I do obey thee,<br>\
&amp;c.:] the ن [of لبّين] being elided because of<br>\
its being prefixed to the pron. (IAar.) Or<br>\
لبّيك is from the saying دَارُ فُلَانٍ تَلُبُّ دَارِى “ the<br>\
house of such a one faces my house ”; (Kh, S,<br>\
K;) and the meaning is I present myself before<br>\
thee, (or repair to thee, K,) doing what thou<br>\
likest, answering thee [after answering, or time<br>\
after time]: the ى is to form the dual number;<br>\
and indicates that the noun is in the acc. case<br>\
as an inf. n. [used as mentioned above]. (Kh,<br>\
S.) Or it means My love [is given] to thee;<br>\
from the expression اِمْرَأَةٌ لَبَّةٌ “ a woman loving<br>\
(and affectionate, TA,) to her husband ”: so in<br>\
the K: but the expression, as related on the<br>\
authority of Kh, is أُمٌّ لَبَّةٌ; which is confirmed<br>\
by a verse that he cites. (TA.) Or the meaning<br>\
is إِخْلَاصِى لَكَ [My sincere service, or the like,<br>\
(is given) to thee;] from the expression حَسَبٌ لُبَابٌ<br>\
“ pure nobility, or the like. ” (K.) Accord. to<br>\
Yoo, لبّيك is a noun in the sing. number with<br>\
the pron. annexed to it: this noun is originally<br>\
لَبَّبٌ, of the measure فَعْلَلٌ: (not of the measure<br>\
فَعَّلٌ, because this is rare in the language:) the<br>\
the last ب is changed into ى to avoid the reduplication; and thus it becomes لَبَّىٌ: then the<br>\
ى, being movent, and immediately preceded by<br>\
fet-hah, is changed into ا; and it becomes لَبَّا<br>\
[or لَبَّى, for the ى in this case is called ا]: then,<br>\
being conjoined with ك in لبّيك, and with ه in<br>\
لبّيه, its ا is changed into ى; after the same<br>\
manner as you say إِلَيْكَ and عَلَيْكَ and لَدَيْكَ.<br>\
(TA.) [But see what here follows.] ―<br>\
-b3-  لَبَّىْ<br>\
يَدَيْكَ is a phrase exactly similar to لبّيك, meaning<br>\
At the service (or, lit. doubly at the service) of<br>\
thy hands! and this is said, in the S, art. لبى<br>\
to be at variance with the opinion of Yoo, given<br>\
above; for, if لبّى were similar to إِلَى &amp;c.,<br>\
being prefixed to a noun, not a pron., it would<br>\
be لَبَّى يَدَيْكَ, not لَبَّىْ.] Accord. to El-Khattá-<br>\
bee, لبّى يديك signifies May thy hands be safe<br>\
and sound! the desinential syntax being disregarded in the saying يديك, which rightly<br>\
should be يَدَاكَ, in order that يديك may match<br>\
in sound with لبّيك: but Z says, that the meaning<br>\
is, I will obey thee, and be at thy free disposal,<br>\
as a thing which thou shalt dispose of with thy<br>\
hands in whatever manner thou shalt please.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  In like manner you say لَبَّىْ زَيْدٍ [At<br>\
the service (or doubly at the service) of Zeyd].<br>\
(Msb.) See art. لبى. ―<br>\
-b5-  لَبِّ, with kesreh for<br>\
its termination, like أَمْس and غَاقِ, is also related<br>\
as having been used: (Sb:) [and it is still used<br>\
in some parts, as signifying At thy service!].<br>\
-A2-<br>\
لَبٌّ keeping, or adhering, [to a thing]: remaining,<br>\
or staying. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A camel-driver who keeps<br>\
constantly to the work of driving the camels, not<br>\
leaving them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  رَجُلٌ لَبٌّ A man who<br>\
keeps to a thing, or affair, or business; as also<br>\
↓ لَبِيبٌ; (S, K;) a man who keeps to his art, or<br>\
craft, or trade, not ceasing from it. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  رجلٌ لَبٌّ طَبٌّ A man who keeps to business,<br>\
[and is skilful, expert, clever, or intelligent].<br>\
(S, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  لَب One who renders himself near<br>\
to people by affection and friendship [or is friendly<br>\
and affectionate to them]: courteous, polite, or<br>\
affable: fem. لَبَّةٌ: pl. لِبَابٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اِمْرَأَةٌ لَبَّةٌ<br>\
A woman who renders herself near by affection<br>\
and friendship [or is friendly and affectionate],<br>\
to people; (S;) courteous, polite, or affable:<br>\
(S, K:) a woman loving to her husband; (K;)<br>\
affectionate to him: or, accord. to Kh, the<br>\
expression is أُمٌّ لَبَّةٌ: see لَبٌّ, above. (TA.)<br>\
لُبٌّ (S, K) and ↓ لُبَابٌ (Msb) of a nut, an almond,<br>\
and the like, What is in the inside; (S;) the heart,<br>\
or kernel: (K:) of a palm-tree, the heart, or pith,<br>\
called قَلْبٌ or قُلْبٌ. (S, K.) Pl. of the former<br>\
لُبُوبٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  لُبٌّ (S, K) and ↓ لُبَابٌ (TA) What<br>\
is pure, or the choice, or best, part, of anything:<br>\
(S, K:) pl. of the former أَلْبَابٌ. (A&#39;Obeyd.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  لُبُّ الحِنْطَةِ [The purest substance of wheat:<br>\
see فَالُوذٌ:] (T, L, art. فلذ &amp;c:) [also called<br>\
البُرِّ ↓ لُبَابُ, acc. to Sprenger, “Life of Mohammad,” (Allahabad, 1851,) p. 24, note 1.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
[Hence,] لُبٌّ of a man, (TA,) (tropical:)  Understanding;<br>\
intellect; intelligence; or mind; syn. عَقْلٌ: (S,<br>\
K:) the understanding, &amp;c., that is put into the<br>\
heart of a man: so called because it is the<br>\
choicest or best part of him: or it is not so<br>\
called unless it is pure from cupidity, or lust,<br>\
and foul imaginations; and therefore has a<br>\
more special sense than عقل: so in the Keshf<br>\
el-Keshsháf: (TA:) pl. أَلْبَابٌ, and sometimes<br>\
أَلُبٌّ; (S, K;) like as أَبْؤُسٌ is pl. of بُؤْسٌ, and<br>\
أَنْعُمٌ of نُعْمٌ; (S;) and أَلْبُبٌ; (S, K;) the last<br>\
being used, without incorporating the second ب<br>\
into the first, in case of necessity in poetry. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  بَنَاتُ أَلْبُبٍ Certain veins in the heart; the<br>\
sources of tenderness, affection, kindness, or compassion. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  تَأْبَى لَهُ ذٰلِكَ بَنَاتُ أَلْبُبِى<br>\
[My tenderness forbids the doing so to him]:<br>\
said by an Arab woman of the desert, on the<br>\
occasion of her reproving her son, to one who<br>\
asked her why she did not curse him. (S.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
أَلْقَى عَلَيْهِ بَنَاتَ أَلْبُبِهِ He loved it. (L, art. شر.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  The following words of the poet,<br>\
قَدْ عَلِمَتْ ذَاكَ بَنَاتُ أَلْبُبِهْ<br>\
signify, accord. to the M, My intellect knew<br>\
that. (TA.) El-Mubarrad read أَلْبَبِهْ in the<br>\
above words of the poet: (TA:) the meaning of<br>\
these words, accord. to him, is, The daughters of<br>\
the most intelligent of his tribe knew this. (S,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  If you form a pl. from [the pl.] أَلْبُبٌ,<br>\
it is أَلَابِبُ; and the dim. n. is أُلَيْبِبٌ. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b10-  ذُو لُبٍّ Possessing, having, or a person of,<br>\
understanding, or intelligence: pl. أُولُوا الْأَلْبَابِ<br>\

لَبَبٌ: see لَبَّةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  The breast-girth, or thing that<br>\
is bound over the breast of a beast, (or a she-camel, S,) to prevent the saddle from slipping<br>\
back: (S, K:) it is an appertenance to the<br>\

(S, L, K;) the middle of the breast: (L:) the<br>\
pit above the breast, between the collar-bones;<br>\
the place where camels are stabbed: (see لَبَّهُ:)<br>\
or the bones [probably a mistake for the part<br>\
next above the bones] that are above the breast,<br>\
and below the throat, between the collar-bones,<br>\
where camels are stabbed: he who says that it<br>\
is the pit in the throat errs: (IKt:) [for it is<br>\
just beneath the throat:] pl. of the former<br>\
لَبَّاتٌ (S) and لِبَابٌ; and of the latter أَلْبَابٌ.<br>\
(TA.) Also, both words, (the latter ↓ accord. to<br>\

the Arabs to a man on the occasion of becoming<br>\
favourably disposed towards him, (Yoo,) No<br>\
harm, No harm. Syn. لَا بَأْسَ. (K.) ISd thinks<br>\
it to be from a preceding meaning; [that of<br>\
“ keeping, or adhering ”;] observing that when<br>\
one dispels evil from another, he [the latter]<br>\
loves to adhere to him: [so that it seems to be<br>\
an imp. verbal n., like نَزَالِ &amp;c., meaning keep<br>\
with me, and fear not]. (TA.)<br>\
هُوَ لُبَابُ قَوْمِهِ [He is the choice one, or best, of<br>\

by بعد ذاك is meant مع ذاك; and by لبيب,<br>\
مُقِيم, (remaining, or staying,) or, accord. to some,<br>\

he-goat makes at rutting-time. (K.)<br>\
لَبْلَابٌ A certain herb: syn. حَشِيشَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
A certain plant, (K,) that twines about trees:<br>\
(S:) [a species of dolichos, the dolichos lablab<br>\
of Linn.: accord. to Golius, as from the S,<br>\
convolvulus, a herb which as it rises embraces<br>\
a tree: and he adds, pecul., the helxine: (Diosc.<br>\
iv., 39, Beith:) either as if لفلاف, from لف;<br>\
or from the love with which it seems to embrace the tree; whence it is also called عشقة<br>\
[q. v.], and is a symbol of love which endures after<br>\
death.] A well-known herb, or leguminous plant,<br>\
(بقلة, q. v.,) used medicinally. (TA.) See عُصْرٌ.<br>\
لَوْلَبٌ A large quantity of water, which, when<br>\
the aperture (مَفْتَح, as in the T; or فَتْح, as in<br>\
MS. copies of the K; in the CK فُتُح;) [mean-<br>\
ing the aperture of the tank or the like] carries<br>\
off thereof what it can, and the hole by which it<br>\
runs out (صُنْبُورُهُ, meaning the مَثْعَب of the water,<br>\
TA,) is too narrow to admit it freely on account<br>\
of its abundance, whirls round, and becomes like<br>\
the spout of a vessel. (T, K.) AM says, I<br>\
know not whether it be an Arabic word or<br>\
arabicized; but the people of El-&#39;Irák are fond<br>\
of using it. (TA.) [It appears to be from the<br>\
Persian لُولَهْ, as Golius thinks; and is used in<br>\
modern Arabic in several other senses; namely,<br>\
A tube through which water flows: the spout of<br>\
a ewer, of an alembic, and the like: a cock, or<br>\
tap: a turning pin, or peg; a screw: and the<br>\
like. Its more appropriate place, I think, would<br>\
be in an art. composed of the letters للب (accord.<br>\
to what is said of مُلَوْلَبٌ in the S, K); or rather,<br>\
(accord. to its derivation from the Pers.,) لولب.]<br>\
Pl. لَوَالِبُ. (TA.)<br>\
أُلْبُوبٌ [and also, accord. to Golius, أَلْبُوبٌ,] The<br>\
kernel of the stone of the نَبِق [or fruit of<br>\
the lote-tree]. (K.) It is sometimes eaten:<br>\
(TA:) and is also called صَلّامٌ. (TA in art.<br>\
صلم.)<br>\
مُلَبٌّ: see next paragraph.<br>\
مُلْبَبٌ and ↓ مُلَبٌّ (K: the former on the<br>\
authority of ISk; but Ibn-Keysán says that it<br>\
is wrong; and that the latter is the right: S:)<br>\
and ↓ مَلْبُوبٌ (IAar, K) A beast of carriage<br>\
furnished with a لَبَب, or breast-leather. (S, K.)<br>\
مَلْبُوبٌ (tropical:)  Characterized by understanding, or<br>\
intelligence. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See preceding paragraph.<br>\
تَلْبِيبٌ The portion of the clothes that is at the<br>\
part called لَبَب: a subst., like تَمْتِينٌ: (K:) pl.<br>\
تَلَابِيبُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَخَذَ بِتَلْبِيبِهِ He drew together<br>\
his clothes at the bosom, and seized him, dragging<br>\
him along: (T:) he took him by the لَبَّة: you<br>\
also say اخذ بِتَلَابِيبِهِ. (TA.) See also 2 and 5.<br>\
