-A3-  In a trad.<br>\
respecting Moses and the stone, occur the words,<br>\
فَلَجَبَهُ ثَلَاثَ لَجَبَاتٍ, which IAth says he cannot<br>\
explain, unless the right reading be فَلَحَتَهُ ثلاث<br>\
لَحَتَاتٍ [And he struck it three blows]. (TA.)<br>\

[but see what is said respecting the last of the<br>\
pls. mentioned below] and ↓ لَجِبَةٌ and ↓ لِجَبَةٌ<br>\
(K) the last two from Th. (TA.) A sheep or<br>\
goat (شاة, K), or a sheep only, not a goat,<br>\
(ISk, S,) of which the milk has become little in<br>\
quantity: (S, K:) or a sheep or goat (شاة)<br>\
which has passed four months since her bringing<br>\
forth, and of which the milk has in consequence<br>\
dried up: (As, S:) or it is an epithet applied<br>\
specially to a goat: (K:) a poet (Muhelhil,<br>\
TA,) says,<br>\
عَجِبَتْ أَبْنَاؤُنَا مِنْ فِعْلِنَا<br>\
إِذْ نَبِيعُ الخَيْلَ بِالمِعْزَى اللِّجَابْ<br>\
[Our sons wondered at our action, in our selling<br>\
horses for goats of which the milk had become<br>\
little, or dried up]: (S:) and contr., abounding<br>\
with milk: (K:) a poet applies the two epithets<br>\
لَجْبَة and حَاشِكَة to the same sheep or goat; but<br>\
he may mean that her milk was little at one<br>\
time, and abundant at another. (TA.) Pl. [of<br>\
لَجْبَةٌ] لِجَابٌ (S, K) and لَجْبَاتٌ (this being<br>\
allowed by Mbr, agreeably with analogy, TA)<br>\
and لَجَبَاتٌ (S, K): the last dev. with respect to<br>\
rule; for by rule it should be لَجْبَاتٌ; unless<br>\
it be originally a subst. used as an epithet,<br>\
like as one says إِمْرَأَةٌ كَلْبَةٌ; or unless ↓ لَجَبَةٌ<br>\
be a syn. of the sing. (S.) Sb says, that<br>\
لَجَبَاتٌ is used as pl. because some of the Arabs<br>\
used ↓ لَجَبَةٌ as sing. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اللّجب [app.<br>\
اللَّجَبُ, a quasi-pl. n.,], occurring in the following<br>\
words of a trad., فَيَبْدُو أَمْثَالُ اللجبِ مِنَ الذَّهَبِ,<br>\
is said to be pl. of لَجْبَةٌ: or it is اللِّجَبُ, like as<br>\
قِصَعٌ is pl. of قَصْعَةٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  In a trad.<br>\
respecting Ed-Dejjál, according to one reading,<br>\
occur the words, بلجبتى البابِ: but Aboo-Moosà says, that the right reading is with ف<br>\
[instead of the ب, and with ى before it: i. e.<br>\
بِلَجِيفَتَى الباب: see art. لجف]. (TA.)<br>\

more common word; and the ل appears to be<br>\
substituted for the ن. (ISd.)<br>\
