لَمَزَهُ, aor.<br>\
لَمِزَ and<br>\
لَمُزَ, inf. n. لَمْزٌ, He made a sign<br>\
to him with the eye, or the like, (S, A, * Msb, K,)<br>\
as the head, and the lip, with low speech. (TA.)<br>\
This is the original signification. (S, Msb, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (S, Msb, TA,) He blamed, upbraided,<br>\
or reproached, him; he found fault with him:<br>\
(S, Msb, K:) or he did so in his face: (TA:) or<br>\
he met him with blaming, upbraiding, reproaching<br>\
or finding fault: (IKtt, TA:) or he spoke evil<br>\
of him, or spoke of him in a manner that he disliked, mentioning vices or faults as chargeable to<br>\
him, either behind his back or before his face,<br>\
though it might be with truth; syn. إِغْتَابَهُ. (TA.)<br>\
The two forms of the aor. occur in readings of<br>\
the words of the Kur., [ix. 58,] وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَلْمِزُكَ<br>\
فِى الصَّدَقَاتِ and يَلْمُزُكَ, (S, TA,) And of them<br>\
are those who blame thee with respect to the<br>\
division of the alms: (Bd, Jel:) and Ibn-Ketheer<br>\
reads ↓ يُلَامِزُكَ. (Bd.)<br>\
-A2-  لَمَزَهُ, (Ks, S,) aor<br>\
لَمِزَ, (S,)<br>\
inf. n. لَمْزٌ, (S, A, K,) He pushed him, or impelled<br>\
him, or repelled him: (Ks, T, S, A, K:) said by<br>\
AM to be the primary signification: (TA:) and<br>\
he struck him, or beat him. (S, A, K.)<br>\
3<br>\
رَأَيْتُهُ يُلَاغِزُهُ وَيُلَامِرُهُ [means I saw him talking<br>\
enigmatically with him, or to him, and making<br>\
signs with him, or to him: or, accord. to the TA,<br>\
مُلَامَزَةٌ is syn. with مُلَاغَزَةٌ]. (A, in art. لغز.)<br>\
لُمَزَةٌ One who blames, upbraids, reproaches, or<br>\
finds fault with, others, much, or habitually;<br>\
(S, K;) as also ↓ لَمَّازٌ, (so in two copies of the<br>\
S, and in a copy of the A,) or ↓ لَمَازٌ, like سَحَابٌ:<br>\
(K:) لُمَزَةٌ is applied to a man and to a woman;<br>\
for its ة is to denote intensiveness, and not the<br>\
fem. gender: (TA:) هُمَزَةٌ and لُمَزَةٌ signify the<br>\
same; (ISk, Zj, K;) i. e., one who speaks evil of<br>\
others, or does so in their absence, though it may<br>\
be with truth; (يَغْتَابُهُمْ; and this may mean<br>\
[who detracts by making signs] with the side of<br>\
the mouth, or with the eye, or with the head;<br>\
TA;) and defames them; (ISk, Zj, TA;) or one<br>\
who often goes about with calumny, a separater of<br>\
companions and friends: (Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, TA:)<br>\
and ↓ لَمَّازٌ, like شَدَّادٌ, a frequent, or habitual,<br>\
calumniator, or slanderer: (TA:) or هُمَزَةٌ and<br>\
لُمَزَةٌ differ in signification; the latter signifying<br>\
one who blames, upbraids, reproaches, or finds<br>\
fault with, thee to thy face; and the former, one<br>\
who does so in thine absence; (K;) and Lth<br>\
says the like: (TA:) or the latter, one who<br>\
speaks evil of others, though it may be with truth,<br>\
(مُغْتَابٌ,) behind the back; and the former, one<br>\
who does so to the face: or the latter, one who<br>\
speaks against the lineages of men; and the former,<br>\
one who speaks against the characters of men:<br>\
or the latter, [one who reproaches] with the tongue;<br>\
and the former, with the eye: or the reverse:<br>\
(K [but omitted in the CK], TA:) or the latter<br>\
signifies one who excites discord, or animosity,<br>\
between two persons. (TA.) See also هُمَزَةٌ. And<br>\
see the Ksh and Bd in civ. 1.<br>\
لَمَازٌ: see لُمَزَةٌ.<br>\
لَمَّازٌ [One who makes frequent signs with the<br>\
eye, or the like: fem. with ة: see one ex. voce<br>\
رَمَّازٌ]. ―<br>\
-b2-  See also لُمَزَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
لَامِزٌ act. part. n. of 1. ―<br>\
-b2-  لُمَّازٌ [its pl.] Persons<br>\
who speak evil of others, though it may be with<br>\
truth, (مُغْتَابُونَ,) in their presence. (IAar, TA.)<br>\
