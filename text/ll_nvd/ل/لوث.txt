تَلْوِيثٌ, signifies the same; but it is not so: it is<br>\

became confused ”, and “ it became wound<br>\
about. ” (TA.)<br>\

having existed enmity between them two, [i. e., the<br>\
slain person and the person accused of slaying<br>\
him,] or, of one&#39;s having threatened the other;<br>\
and the like: it is from تَلَوَّثَ as signifying “ it<br>\
was befouled, or defiled. ” (TA.) ―<br>\
