لَزِجَ, aor.<br>\
لَزَجَ, (S, M, K,) inf. n. لَزَجٌ and<br>\
لُزُوجَةٌ (M) and لُزُوجٌ; (Msb;) and ↓ تلزّج;<br>\
(M;) It (a thing, S) stretched out, in a neut.<br>\
sense: it roped; or drew out, with a viscous,<br>\
glutinous, clammy, cohesive, sticky, ropy, or slimy,<br>\
continuity of parts: syn. تَمَطَّطَ and تَمَدَّدَ:<br>\
(S, K:) it was, or became, viscous, glutinous,<br>\
clammy, cohesive, sticky, ropy, or slimy, so as to<br>\
adhere to the hand and the like. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
لَزِجَ بِهِ It adhered to him, or it, as glue or the<br>\
like; syn. غَرِىَ. (S, K.) E. g. أَكَلْتُ شَيْئًا فَلَزِجَ<br>\
بِأَصَابِعِى I ate a thing and it adhered to my<br>\
fingers. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And] ↓ تلزّج It (food, or<br>\
ointment,) became [viscous, glutinous, clammy,<br>\
cohesive, sticky, slimy, ropy, or mucilaginous,]<br>\
like خِطْمِىّ [or marsh-mallow]. (M, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
النَّبَاتُ ↓ تلزّج i. q. تَلَجَّنَ: (S, K:) i. e., The<br>\
herbage became flaccid, and one part thereof inclined over another: (TA:) [or became flaccid,<br>\
and of a viscous consistency, or viscous or mucilaginous in its juice; as appears from what here<br>\
follows]. Ru-beh says, [in the S, El-&#39;Ajjáj,]<br>\
describing a pair af asses, male and female,<br>\
وَفَرَعَا مِنْ رَعْىِ مَا تَلَزَّجَا<br>\
[And they finished pasturing upon what had<br>\
become flaccid, and of a viscous consistency].<br>\
For, says J, [immediately after citing these<br>\
words of the poet,] when herbage begins to dry<br>\
up, its juice thickens, and becomes like the<br>\
mucilage of the خِطْمِىّ [or marsh-mallow].<br>\
(TA.) Or the words of the poet, above quoted,<br>\
signify, And they finished pasturing upon what<br>\
they had searched after constantly, or time after<br>\
time: for تَلَزُّجٌ also signifies the searching of a<br>\
beast of carriage after herbage and leguminous<br>\
plants, constantly, or time after time: and the<br>\
two asses are here the agents of the verb تلزّجا.<br>\

-b2-  تلزّج رَأْسُهُ His head remained<br>\
unpurified of its dirt (S, K) after he had washed<br>\
it. (Yaakoob, S.)<br>\
لَزِجٌ (S, M, Msb) and ↓ مُتَلَزِّجٌ (M), A thing<br>\
stretching out, in a neut. sense: roping; or<br>\
drawing out, with a viscous, glutinous, clammy,<br>\
cohesive, sticky, or slimy, continuity of parts:<br>\
syn. مُتَمَطِّطٌ and مُتَمَدِّدٌ: (S:) viscous, glutinous,<br>\
