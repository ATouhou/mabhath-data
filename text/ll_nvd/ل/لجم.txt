أَلْجَمَ He bridled a beast; agreeably with<br>\
an explanation in the K: and sometimes he<br>\
bitted him; as expl. in the Msb.<br>\
5<br>\
تَلَجَّمَتْ: see 10 in art. ثفر.<br>\
لُجَمٌ: see لُجْمَةٌ.<br>\
لُجْمَةٌ and ↓ لِجَامٌ A thing from which one augurs<br>\
evil; an omen, or a bodement, of evil: because<br>\
it refrains one from a thing that he wants. (A,<br>\
art. عطس.) ↓ لُجَمٌ, which is originally the plural<br>\
of both, is also used as a sing. (A, ibid, where<br>\
see an ex.) See عَطَسَ and عَطُوسٌ.<br>\
لِجَامٌ [A bit; i. e., the iron appurtenances of<br>\
a bridle]. To the لجام belong pieces of iron<br>\
which are fastened one to another; as the<br>\
عِضَادَتَانِ, and the مِسْحَل, and the فَأْس and<br>\
its extremities of iron. (Az, in TA, voce قَيْقَبٌ.)<br>\
The above explanation is incomplete: it means<br>\
the bridle, or headstall and reins, with the bit<br>\
and other appurtenances; like its Persian original, لِكَامْ: see قَرَّطَ. It signifies The piece of<br>\
iron in the mouth of the horse: thus, by extension, applied to this with its thongs, or straps,<br>\
and apparatus: it comprises the شَكِيمَة, which<br>\
is the transverse piece of iron in the mouth; and<br>\
the فَأْس, which is the piece of iron standing up<br>\
in the mouth; and the مِسْحَل, which is the iron<br>\
beneath the حَنَك; and the خُطَّافَانِ, which are two<br>\
bent pieces of iron in the مِسْحَل and the شكيمة,<br>\
on the right and left; and the فَرَاشَتَانِ, which<br>\
are two pieces of iron wherewith are fastened<br>\
the extremities of the عِذَارَانِ; and the حَكَمَة,<br>\
which is the ring surrounding the مَرْسَِن and the<br>\
حَنَك, of silver or iron or thong. (IDrd, in his<br>\
Book on the Saddle and Bridle.)<br>\
