لَخَّصَ لخّصهُ, (A, TA,) inf. n. تَلْخِيصٌ, (S, A, K,)<br>\
He explained, expounded, or interpreted, it; (S,<br>\
A, K;) he made it clear; (A, K;) namely,<br>\
language: (A:) تَلْخِيصٌ and تَبْيِينٌ and شَرْحٌ<br>\
and تَخْلِيصٌ all signify the same: (A:) he went<br>\
to the utmost point in explaining it, expounding<br>\
it, interpreting it, and making it plain: namely,<br>\
a thing; as also لحّصهُ. (TA.) You say,<br>\
لَخِّصْ لِى خَبَرَكَ Explain thou to me thy news, or<br>\
information, thing after thing. (TA.) And it<br>\
is said in a trad. of &#39;Alee, قَعَدَ لِتَلْخِيصِ مَا الْتَبَسَ<br>\
عَلَى غَيْرِهِ He sat to make clear what was confused<br>\
and dubious to others. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He made it<br>\
near: [the inf. n. being explained in the TA<br>\
by التقريب; but I incline to think that this is a<br>\
mistranscription, for التّعْرِيبُ; and that the meaning is, he made it clear, plain, distinct, or<br>\
perspicuous:] he abridged it: he restricted, or<br>\
limited, himself in it, namely, a saying, and<br>\
abridged of it what was needful. (TA.)<br>\
مُلَخَّصٌ The sum or result or conclusion [of a<br>\
thing]. (TA.)<br>\
لخف لخم لخن لخى<br>\
