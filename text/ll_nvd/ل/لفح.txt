لَفَحَتْهُ النَّارُ, (S, M, K,) aor.<br>\
لَفَحَ, (M,) inf. n.<br>\
لَفْحٌ and لَفَحَانٌ, (M, K,) The fire smote, or hurt,<br>\
his face; as also لفحت وَجْهَهُ: (M, O:) the fire<br>\
burned him; (TA;) as also نفحته النار بِحَرِّهَا;<br>\
(S, K;) and in like manner the hot wind called<br>\
سَمُوم: (S:) لَفَحَتْ and نَفَحَتْ are syn., except<br>\
that the effect of النَّفْح is greater than that of<br>\
اللَّفْح: (Zj:) or لَفْحٌ relates to a hot wind; and<br>\
نَفْحٌ, to a cold, or cool, wind: (As, S:) you also<br>\
say لفحته السَّمُوم meaning the سموم blew in his face.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also لَفَحَهُ, aor.<br>\
لَفَحَ, He smote, or struck,<br>\
him, with a sword, (S, K,) lightly, or slightly:<br>\
you say لَفَحْتُهُ بِالسَّيْفِ لَفْحَةً I struck him with<br>\
the sword a light, or slight, blow. (S.)<br>\
أَصَابَهَ لفْحٌ مِنْ حَرُورٍ وَسَمُومٍ A burning gust of<br>\
hot night-wind, and of hot day-wind, smote him.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَصَابَهُ مِنَ الحَرِّ لَفْحٌ وَمِنَ البَرْدِ نَفْحٌ [A<br>\
blast of heat smote him, and a blast of cold]. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  You say also لَوَافِحُ السَّمُوِم [pl. of ↓ لَافِحَةٌ,<br>\
and meaning Burning blasts of the سموم]. (S,<br>\
K in art. سفع.)<br>\
لَفْحَةٌ A light, or slight, blow with a sword. (S.)<br>\
لُقَّاحٌ A certain well known plant, (K,) of the<br>\
kind termed يَقْطِينِىٌّ, (L,) which people smell, (S.)<br>\
yellow, and of sweet odour, (A, L,) resembling the<br>\
بَاذِنْجَان (S, A, K,) when it becomes yellow;<br>\
(S, A;) [accord. to Golius, app. on the authority<br>\
of Ibn-Beytár, the same which the Syrians and<br>\
Egyptians call شَمَّامٌ, q. v.]. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, The fruit,<br>\
or produce, (ثَمَرَة,) of the يَبْرُوح [or mandrake,<br>\
which is called by this name (يبروح) in the<br>\
present day]; (K;) thus correctly written, with<br>\
the ى before the ب [not ببروح, as in the CK<br>\
and some MS. copies]. (TA.) [It seems that<br>\
the application of the term لفّاح to both the mandrake and the شمّام has led to confusion, and<br>\
occasioned Linnæus to call the latter “ cucumis<br>\
dudaim. ” See also يَبْرُوحٌ, and مَغْدٌ.]<br>\
