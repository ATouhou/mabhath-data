plants: (K:) or produced the first of the herbage,<br>\
so that the beasts saw it and desired it and licked<br>\

لَا حُوسٌ: see مِلْحَسٌ.<br>\
مَلْحَسٌ is a noun of place; [signifying A<br>\
place of licking; &amp;c;] as well as an inf. n.: and<br>\
in both cases it has مَلَاحِسُ for pl. (IJ.) You<br>\
say, تَرَكْتُهُ بِمَلَا حِسِ البَقَرِ, (S, A, K,) or بِمَلَاحِسِ<br>\
البَقَرِ أَوْلَادَهَا, (TA,) meaning, (tropical:)  I left him in the<br>\

(S, ISd, A, K) from the membranes in which<br>\
they are born: (ISd, TA:) or in a desert place,<br>\
(S,) or in a desert, or waterless desert, (ISd, A,<br>\
TA,) so that it was not known where he was;<br>\
(S;) because the wild cows bring forth only in<br>\
the deserts: (ISd, TA:) the former is like the<br>\
saying بِمَبَاحِثِ البَقَرِ; (S;) and is that which<br>\
ISd holds to be the right: (TA:) in the latter,<br>\
ملاحس is an inf. n., in the pl. form, which is<br>\
strange; because it governs اولاد in the accus.<br>\
case; and a prefixed noun [مَوَاضِع] is understood<br>\
before it: (IJ:) some relate the saying differently, thus, بِمَلْحَسِ البَقَرِ أَوْلَادَهَا, meaning,<br>\
بِمَوْضِعِ مَلْحَسِ البَقَرِ أَوْلَادَهَا [in the place of the<br>\
cows&#39; licking their young ones]; (K;) because<br>\
[some hold that] an inf. n. of the measure مَفْعَلٌ<br>\
has no pl. (TA.)<br>\
مُلْحِسٌ: see مِلْحَسٌ.<br>\
مِلْحَسٌ (tropical:)  Greedy; as also ↓ لَحْوَس (K) and<br>\
↓ لَاحُوسٌ and ↓ مُلْحِسٌ: (TA:) and one who takes<br>\
everything that he can. (K:) or a greedy man,<br>\
who takes everything that he can: (A:) one who<br>\

[originally, a lick-dish:] and [in like manner]<br>\
↓ لَحُوسٌ (tropical:)  a man who seeks after sweets, like the<br>\
fly. (A, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (assumed tropical:)  Courageous: (K:) as<br>\
though an eater of everything that rose up to<br>\
him. (TA.)<br>\
