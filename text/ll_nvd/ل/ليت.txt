لَاتَهُ, aor. يَليِتُ, (inf. n. لَيْتٌ, S,) as also<br>\
لَاتَةُ, aor. يَلُوتُ; or لَاتَهُ عَنْ وَجْهِهِ; as also<br>\
↓ أَلَاتَهُ; (and أَلَتَهُ; S, K, art. أَلت;) He withheld him, or restrained him, and turned him, or<br>\
averted him, from his course, purpose, or object.<br>\
(S, K.) The Rájiz says,<br>\
وَلَيْلَةٍ ذَاتِ دُجًا سَرَيْتُ<br>\
وَلَمْ يَلِتْنِى عَنْ سُرَاهَا لَيْتُ<br>\
[During many a dark night (or many a rainy,<br>\
or wet, night, accord. to the reading in the TA,<br>\
namely ذات نَدًى) have I journeyed;] and no<br>\
hindrance hindered me from journeying during<br>\
it: (S:) or the meaning is ―<br>\
-b2-  and no averting<br>\
thing averted me, &amp;c.; لَيْتُ being put for لَائِتُ:<br>\
or, nothing made me to repent, and say, لَيْتَنِى<br>\
مَا سَرَيْتُهَا Would that I had not journeyed during<br>\
it! or, no deficiency, nor any impotence, averted<br>\
me, &amp;c., accord. to the T. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  لَاتَهُ حَقَّهُ,<br>\
aor. يَلِيتُ, inf. n. لَيْتٌ; and ↓ أَلَاتَهُ; but the<br>\
former is the more approved; as also أَلَاتَهُ and<br>\
أَلِتهُ; He diminished unto him his due, or right:<br>\
[or defrauded him of part thereof.]. (TA.) It<br>\
is said in the Kur, [xlix. 14,] لَايَلِتْكُمْ مِنْ أَعْمَالِكُمْ<br>\
شَيْئًا He will not diminish unto you, nor defraud<br>\
you of, aught [of the reward] of your works.<br>\
(Fr, Zj.) ―<br>\
-b4-  مَا أَلَانَهُ شَيْئًا; as also مَا أَلَتَهُ (and<br>\
مَا أَلتَهُ; TA;) He did not diminish unto him<br>\
aught. (Fr, S, K.) In مَا أَلَتْنَاهُمْ مِنْ عَمَلِهِمْ مِنْ<br>\
شَىْءٍ, in the Kur, [lii. 21, q. v. in art. ألت.]<br>\
the verb may be from أَلَتَ or from أَلَاتَ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  الحَقَّ ↓ بِتُّ أُلِيتُ in a verse of &#39;Orweh Ibn-El-Ward, signifies أُحِيلُهُ and أُصْرِفُهُ [I passed the<br>\
night putting away (from my mind the thought<br>\
of) death: the poet having just before mentioned<br>\
the death of certain of his camels]. (Sh, L.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
In the following saying, الحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ الَّذِى لَا يُفَاتُ<br>\
وَلَا يَلَاتُ وَلَا تَشْتَبِهُ عَلَيْهِ الأَصْوَاتُ [Praise be to God,<br>\
whom nothing will escape, (lit., who will not be<br>\
escaped, see Kur xxxiv. 50, and 1 in art. فوت,)<br>\
and —, and to whom voices will not be confused,<br>\
or undistinguishable, one from another!], لا يلات<br>\
is from أَلَاتَ, a dial. var. of لَاتَ, aor. يلِيتُ, in<br>\
the sense of نَقَصَ, and signifies unto whom one<br>\
cannot diminish [aught that is his due], and<br>\
whom prayer cannot be hindered from reaching:<br>\
so accord. to IAar: or, accord. to Khálid Ibn<br>\
Jembeh, upon whom nothing that any one<br>\
saith can have any power; (expl. by لا يأخد فيه<br>\
قول قائل;) i. e., who obeyeth no one. (L.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
لَاتَ شَيْاً, aor. يَلِيتُ, He concealed a thing that<br>\
he knew, and told, or narrated, something different from it. (TA, art. لوث, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b8-  لَاتَهُ,<br>\
aor. يَلِيتُ, inf. n. لَيْتٌ, He expressed to him the<br>\
news, or information, obscurely, or enigmatically,<br>\
or obscured it to him, or concealed it from him:<br>\
so accord. to As, and the like is said in the L:<br>\
but accord. to some, the verb is لَاتَهُ, aor. يَلُوتُ,<br>\
q. v., in art. لوت. (TA, art. لوت) ―<br>\
-b9-  وَلَاتَ<br>\
حِينَ مَنَاصٍ, occurring in the Kur, [xxxviii. 2,]<br>\
(S,) [there meaning, accord. to the general<br>\
opinion, When (it, or the time,) was not a time<br>\
of flight: in other cases, and (it, or the time,) is,<br>\
or was, not a time of flight]. لات is here likened<br>\
to لَيْسَ; and the name of the agent is understood. (S, K.) So says Akh, accord. to J;<br>\
but this is the opinion of Sb: so in the margin of<br>\
some copies of the S. (TA.) Or لات is originally لا; and the ت is added, as in ثُمَّتَ [in the<br>\
CK, ثَمَّت,] (El-Muärrij, S, K,) and رُبَّتَ.<br>\
(El-Muärrij, S.) ―<br>\
-b10-  With respect to the proper<br>\
meaning and etymology of لات there are four<br>\
opinions. First, that it is a single word, a verb<br>\
in the pret. tense: and some say, that it is originally لَاتَ in the sense of نَقَصَ, and afterwards<br>\
used as a negative, like قَلَّ: so says Aboo-Dharr<br>\
El-Khushanee, in his Expos. of the Book of Sb:<br>\
others, that it is originally لَيِسَ; that its س is<br>\
changed into ت, and then the ى into ا, because<br>\
it is movent and preceded by fet-hah: so says<br>\
Abu-r-Rabeea. Second, that it is two words,<br>\
the negative لا, with the fem. ت, added to make<br>\
the word fem., as say IHsh and Er-Radee, or to<br>\
render the negation more intensive, as is said in<br>\
the Expos. of the Katr by the author of the latter<br>\
work: and this is the general opinion. Third,<br>\
that it is an independent word, not originally<br>\
ليس nor لا; as related by the sheykh Aboo-Is-<br>\
hák Esh-Shátibee alone. Fourth, that it is a<br>\
word and a part of a word, namely the negative<br>\
لا, and ت prefixed to حين; which opinion is<br>\
ascribed to A&#39;Obeyd [as is mentioned in the S]<br>\
and Ibn-El-Taráweh: the former of whom<br>\
argues in favour of this opinion from the fact<br>\
that ت is found so prefixed in Othmán&#39;s copy of<br>\
the Kur-án; but this is no proof, because there<br>\
are found in the writing of that copy things at<br>\
variance with analogy. (TA.) تَحِينَ [however] occurs, without لات, in the following verse<br>\
of Aboo-Wejzeh:<br>\
العَاطِفُونَ تَحِينَ مَا مِنْ عَاطِفٍ<br>\
وَالمُطْعِمُونَ زَمَانَ أَيْنَ المُطْعِمُ<br>\
[The persons who act affectionately in the time<br>\
when there is none (other) that acts affectionately;<br>\
and the feeders in the time when (it is said)<br>\
Where is the feeder?] (S.) The general opinion<br>\
is favoured by the following facts: that لات is<br>\
pronounced in a case of pause لَاتْ and لَاهْ: that<br>\
it is written separately from حين: and that it is<br>\
sometimes written لَاتِ, with kesreh to the ت,<br>\
as is mentioned by Z, agreeably with the fundamental rule with respect to the concurrence of<br>\
two quiescent letters [when followed by a conjunctive ا]; whereas, were it a verb in the<br>\
pret. tense, there would be no reason for its being<br>\
written with kesreh: it is also written لَاتُ, with<br>\
dammeh to the ت: and both these variations<br>\
occur in readings of the Kur-án: but لَاتَ, with<br>\
fet-hah to the ت, is the most common. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b11-  With respect to its government there are<br>\
also four opinions. First, that it has no government: that if a noun in the nom. case follow it,<br>\
it is put in that case as an inchoative of which<br>\
[as is mentioned in the S] the enunciative is<br>\
suppressed; and that if a noun in the acc. case<br>\
follow it, it is put in that case as an objective<br>\
complement of a verb suppressed; which is the<br>\
opinion of Akh; the meaning of لات حين مناص<br>\
being, in the former case, لاحِينُ مَنَاصٍ كَائِنٌ لَهُمْ<br>\
[A place of flight not existing for them; which<br>\
does not imply that there was none for others;<br>\
as لا here has the force of a particular, not a<br>\
general, negation]; and in the latter case, the<br>\
meaning being, لَا أَرَى حِينَ مَنَاصٍ [I see not a<br>\
time of flight]. Second, that it governs in the<br>\
same manner as إِنَّ; which is another opinion<br>\
of Akh and the Koofees. Third, that it is a<br>\
particle governing the gen. case; an opinion<br>\
ascribed to Fr by Er-Radee and IHsh and<br>\
others. Fourth, that it governs like لَيْسَ; and<br>\
this is the general opinion; but IHsh restricts<br>\
it by two conditions; that the two nouns which<br>\
it governs must be significant of time, and that<br>\
one of them must be suppressed. (TA.) [It<br>\
is generally the subject, rarely the predicate, that<br>\
is suppressed.] ―<br>\
-b12-  لات [when it has grammatical<br>\
government] does not occur without حين [or,<br>\
as many say, some word syn. therewith, as وَقْت,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (S, K.) So says Akh, accord. to J; but<br>\
this is the assertion of Sb; because the latter<br>\
holds it to have the same government as ليس;<br>\
whereas Akh assigns to it no government [as<br>\
explained above]. (IB.) But [it is said that]<br>\
حين is sometimes suppressed, (in poetry, S, [or<br>\
in prose,]) though meant to be understood; as<br>\
in the following saying of Mázin Ibn-Málik,<br>\
[respecting &#39;Abd-Shems, surnamed Makrooa, the<br>\
son of Saad the son of Zeyd-Menáh the son of<br>\
Temeem, and respecting Heyjumáneh the<br>\
daughter of El-&#39;Ambar the son of &#39;Amr the son<br>\
of Temeem, (S, art. قرع,) who was enamoured<br>\
of Makrooa,] وَحَنَّتْ وَلَاتَ هَنَّتْ وَأَنَّى لَكِ مَقْرُوعٌ<br>\
[And she conceived a longing desire; but it was<br>\
not a time for her conceiving such a desire. And<br>\
how (O Heyjumáneh) should Makrooa be thine?<br>\
See Freytag, Arab. Prov. i. 343 and ii. 525.]<br>\
(S, K.) This, however, is said to be not poetry<br>\
but a prose-example. (TA.) Moreover, it is<br>\
observed, that لات, in this instance, has no<br>\
government, and that a word signifying time is<br>\
not meant to be understood after it: [so that the<br>\
meaning is, And she conceived a longing desire,<br>\
but it was as though she did not conceive such a<br>\
desire:] (MF.) for when لات has government,<br>\
the subject and predicate cannot both be suppressed. (AHei, MF.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَلْيَتَ see 1.<br>\
لَيْتَ a word denoting a wish [signifying<br>\
Would that —; I wish that —;] (S, K;)<br>\
generally relating to a thing that is impossible;<br>\
rarely to a thing that is possible: (IHsh, K:)<br>\
governing the subject in the acc. case, and the<br>\
predicate in the nom. case, (S, K,) like كَأَنَّ (or<br>\
[rather] إِنَّ, MF) and its coordinates, because<br>\
it resembles verbs in their force as words, [being<br>\
composed of at least three letters, and the last<br>\
being meftoohah,] and in their admitting most<br>\
of the pronouns as affixes, and in their meanings.<br>\
(S.) Ex. لَيْتَ زَيْدًا ذَاهِبٌ [Would that Zeyd<br>\
were going;] (S;) and لَيْتَنِى فَعَلْتُ كَذَا وَكَذَا<br>\
[Would that I had done so and so.] (TA.)<br>\
You say لَيْتِى as well as لَيْتَنِى, (S, K,) like<br>\
لَعَلِّى and لَعَلَّنِى, and إِنِّى and إِنَّنِى: (S:) but<br>\
ليتنى is more common than ليتى; whereas<br>\
لعلّنى is less common than لعلّى. (TA.) You<br>\
also say يَا لَيْتَ O, would that —;.] As to the<br>\
saying of the poet,<br>\
يَا لَيْتَ أَيَّامَ الصِّبَا رَوَاجِعَا<br>\
meaning لَنَا رَوَاجِعَ, [O, would that the days of<br>\
youth were returning (to us)!] رواجع is put in the<br>\
acc. case therein as a word descriptive of state:<br>\
(S:) or it is governed in the acc. case by a verb<br>\
understood, as أَقْبَلَتْ, or عَادَتْ, or some other<br>\
verb suitable to the meaning: so says Sb:<br>\
(TA:) or ليت in the above verse may be used<br>\
in the manner of وَجَدْتُ, [see below], (S,) for<br>\
ليت is sometimes used in the manner of وَجَدْتُ<br>\
[I found], (Fr, S, K,) in government, not in<br>\
meaning, (MF,) as related by the grammarians<br>\
on the authority of certain of the Arabs, so that<br>\
it is doubly transitive, and used in the manner<br>\
of verbs: (S:) you say, لَيْتَ زَيْدًا شَاخِصًا [Would<br>\
that Zeyd were going away, &amp;c.]: (S, K:)<br>\
this is done to give intensiveness: one says, for<br>\
this purpose, لَيْتَ زَيْدًا قَائِمًا (Would that Zeyd<br>\
were standing) putting both the subject and the<br>\
predicate in the acc. case. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  لَيْتَمَا:<br>\

لِيتٌ The side of the neck: (S, K:) or the ليتَانِ<br>\
are the lower parts of the two sides of the neck,<br>\
upon which the earrings hang down, behind the<br>\

the ear: or the parts of the neck beneath the<br>\
earrings: or the places upon which the cuppinginstrument is applied; المَحْجَمَتَانِ: pl. أَلْيَاتٌ<br>\

not shown]. (TA.) ―<br>\
