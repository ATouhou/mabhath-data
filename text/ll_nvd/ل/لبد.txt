vultures [with whose life his own was to terminate]<br>\
was called ↓ لُبَدٌ, (S, A, L, K,) because he thought<br>\
that is would not go away nor die. (L.) Thus<br>\

end: (A, L:) some say that لُبَدٌ is a pl., and<br>\
that its sing. is لُبْدَةٌ: others, that it is sing., like<br>\
قُثَمٌ and حُصَمٌ: أَمْوَالٌ and مَالٌ are sometimes<br>\
used in the same sense: لُبَّدٌ seems to be pl. of<br>\

compacted together: (A:) and the like upon a<br>\
camel&#39;s hump: (T, L:) pl. لِبَدٌ. (S.) Hence<br>\
the proverb, هُوَ أَمْنَعُ مِنْ لِبْدَةِ الأَسَدِ [He, or it,<br>\
is more unapproachable, or inaccessible, than the<br>\
mass of hair between the shoulder-blades of the<br>\
lion]. (S, A.) Hence also ذُو لِبْدَةٍ is an appel-lation of the lion; (T, S, A, K;) and so ذُو لِبَدٍ.<br>\
(T, A,) ―<br>\
