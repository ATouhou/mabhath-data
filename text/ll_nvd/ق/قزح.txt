(S,) i. e. certain streaks of an arched form<br>\
appearing in the sky in the days of the [season<br>\
called] رَبِيع, after rain, red and yellow and green,<br>\
(TA,) is imperfectly decl. [accord. to general<br>\
usage], (S,) [that is to say,] it is a compound of<br>\
two words whereof the latter is inseparable from<br>\
the former, so that one may not say تَأَمَّلْ قُزَحَ<br>\
فَمَا أَبْيَنَ قَوْسَهُ [Consider thou Kuzah, for how<br>\
plain is his bow!], (TA,) and the latter word is<br>\
said to be the name of a certain devil, as such,<br>\
imperfectly decl., (TA, Msb,) assigned to the<br>\
same class as زُحَل, which, as Mbr says, is imperfectly decl. as being a proper name and deviating<br>\
from its original form: (TA:) it is said in a<br>\
trad., Say not ye قَوْسُ قُزَحَ, for قُزَحُ is the name<br>\
of a devil, but say قَوْسُ اللّٰهِ: (Msb, TA:) or قُزَحُ<br>\
is the name of a certain angel who is charged<br>\
with the management of the clouds: or the name<br>\
of a certain king of the &#39;Ajam [i. e. Persians or<br>\
foreigners]: (K: [but SM remarks upon this<br>\
last saying as being very strange, deemed improbable by his sheykh (MF), and not found by<br>\
himself in any book except the K:]) or قُزَحُ is<br>\
the name of a mountain in El-Muzdelifeh, and<br>\
the word قَوْس was prefixed to it because this was<br>\
the first place over which the قوس thus called<br>\
appeared in the Time of Ignorance: (TA:) or<br>\
قُزَح thus used is from قُزْحَةٌ, (Msb, K, TA,) of<br>\
which قُزَحٌ is pl., (Msb,) and which signifies a<br>\
streak of yellow and of red and of green, (Msb,<br>\
K, TA,) which are the colours that are in the<br>\
[said] قوس; (TA;) and if so, it is perfectly decl.<br>\
[i. e. one says قَوْسُ قُزَحٍ]: (Msb:) or it is from<br>\
قَزَحَ signifying it was, or became, high, or<br>\
elevated: (K, TA:) Dmr strangely asserts that<br>\
قوس قزح is a mistake, and that it is correctly<br>\
قَوْسُ قَزَعٍ, from قَزَعٌ signifying “ clouds. ”<br>\
(MF, TA.)<br>\
قُزْحَةٌ A streak of yellow and of red and of<br>\

مَلِيحٌ قَزِيحٌ [Seasoned with salt and with the<br>\
seeds called قِزْح;] two epithets applied to food:<br>\
(A:) accord. to the K, the latter is an imitative<br>\
sequent: but, correctly, each has its own proper<br>\
meaning: as is said in the L, the former is from<br>\
المِلْحُ; and the latter, from القِزْح. (TA.)<br>\
قَزَّاحٌ One who sells the seeds called قِزْح, that<br>\
are used in cooking, for seasoning food. (K.)<br>\
قَازِحٌ A hard penis: (K, TA:) an epithet in<br>\
which the quality of a subst. predominates.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سِعْرٌ قَازِحٌ (tropical:)  A dear [or high] current<br>\
price. (K. [For سِعْرٌ, Freytag appears to have<br>\
read شَعِيرٌ.])<br>\
قَوَازِحُ المَآءِ The bubbles of water, (K, TA,) that<br>\
become inflated, and pass away. (TA.)<br>\
تَقْزِيحٌ A thing upon the head of a plant or<br>\
tree, (K, TA,) that divides into several divisions,<br>\
(K, * TA,) like the paw of the dog: (K, TA:) a<br>\
subst. like تَمْتِينٌ and تَنْبِيتٌ. (TA.)<br>\
تَقَازِيحُ (a pl. that has no sing., TA): see<br>\
قِزْح.<br>\
مِقْزَحَةٌ, (S, K,) and accord. to some مَقْزَحَةٌ<br>\
also is allowable, (MF,) [A vessel, or other<br>\
receptacle, for the kind of seeds called قِزْح, that<br>\
are used in cooking, for seasoning food;] a thing<br>\
like a مِمْلَحَة. (S, K.)<br>\
مُقَزَّحٌ A species of trees (شَجَرٌ) resembling the<br>\
fig, (K, TA,) of the strange trees of the desert,<br>\
having short branches, (Mgh, TA,) at the heads<br>\
of which are what resemble the paw of the dog:<br>\
so says IAar. (Mgh.) الشَّجَرَهُ المُقَزَّحَةُ, behind<br>\
which it is forbidden, in a trad., to perform<br>\
prayer, (TA,) or the performing of prayer<br>\
towards which is said in a trad. to be disapproved, is said to be A tree of the sort abovementioned: so says Az: (Mgh:) or, as some<br>\
say, a tree that branches forth into many<br>\
branches: (TA: [see 5:]) or a tree at which the<br>\
dogs and the beasts of prey have emitted their urine<br>\
may be meant thereby. (Mgh, TA.)<br>\
