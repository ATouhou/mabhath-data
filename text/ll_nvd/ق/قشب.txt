قَشْبٌ signifies The act of mixing. (S, Mgh,<br>\
O, K.) You say, قَشَبَ, aor.<br>\
قَشِبَ, inf. n. قَشْبٌ, He<br>\
mixed. (K.) And قُشِبَ, said of anything, It<br>\
was mixed. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And قَشَبَهُ, aor. and inf. n.<br>\
as above, He corrupted, or vitiated, it: (K, TA:)<br>\
or he mixed it (i. e. anything) with a thing that<br>\
corrupted, or vitiated, it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,]<br>\
قَشَبَ الطَّعَامَ, (S, M,) aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
(M,) He poisoned the food; (S;) he mixed the<br>\
food with poison; as also ↓ قشّبهُ: (M, TA:) or<br>\
قَشَبَ signifies he mixed poison, and so prepared it<br>\
that it should take effect upon the body. (IAar,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And قَشَبَهُ, (S, O, K,) aor. as above,<br>\
(K,) and so the inf. n., He gave him poison to<br>\
drink; (S, O, K;) and (TA) so لَهُ ↓ قشّب. (M,<br>\
TA.) And قَشَبَ النَّسْرَ He put poison on flesh-<br>\
meat for the vulture, that he might eat it and die,<br>\
and he might take his feathers. (AA, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And [hence] قَشَبَنِى رِيحُهُ; (K, TA;) and (TA)<br>\
ريحه ↓ قَشَّبَنِى, inf. n. تَقْشِيبٌ; (S, TA;) His, or<br>\
its, odour annoyed me: (S, K, TA:) as though<br>\
meaning it poisoned me. (S, TA.) قَشَبَهُ and<br>\
↓ قشّبهُ both signify He, or it, annoyed him.<br>\
(Mgh.) And قَشَبَهُ الدُّخَانُ means The smoke<br>\
annoyed him by its odour; and oppressed, or overpowered, him. (O.) قَشْبٌ [in a case of this<br>\
kind], (O, K,) as inf. n. of قَشَبَ, aor.<br>\
قَشِبَ, (K,)<br>\
means The affecting [a person] with what is displeasing, or hateful, and with what is deemed<br>\
unclean, or filthy: (O, K: [in the former القَشْبُ<br>\
is expl. by the words الاصابةُ بما يُكْرَهُ ويُسْتَقْذَرُ;<br>\
which, as well as what here follows, shows that<br>\
an assertion in the TK (copied from the TA, and<br>\
adopted by Freytag) respecting the explanation<br>\
in the K, is erroneous:]) and hence the saying of<br>\
&#39;Omar, when he perceived the odour of perfume<br>\
from Mo&#39;áwiyeh when the latter was a pilgrim,<br>\
مَنْ قَشَبَنَا [i. e. Who has affected us with what is<br>\
displeasing &amp;c.?]; likening the odour of perfume<br>\
in this case to a stink. (O.) ―<br>\
-b6-  قَشْبٌ also signifies<br>\
The depriving [one] of reason; (K, TA;) from<br>\
the same word as signifying the act of “ corrupting,” or “ vitiating: ” (TA:) and its verb is<br>\
قَشَبَ, aor.<br>\
قَشِبَ. (K, TA.) &#39;Omar said to one of<br>\
his sons, قَشَبَكَ المَالُ (M, O, TA) i. e. Wealth<br>\
has deprived thee of thy reason: (M:) or has<br>\
corrupted, or vitiated, thee, and deprived thee of<br>\
thy reason. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And قَشَبَهُ, (S, M, O,<br>\
K,) aor. as above, (K,) and so the inf. n., (M,<br>\
K,) (assumed tropical:)  He spoke evil of him: (S, O:) (tropical:)  he aspersed<br>\
him, or upbraided him, (M, K, TA,) بِشَىْءٍ with<br>\
a thing; (K, TA;) and so ↓ قشّبهُ, inf. n. تَقْشِيبٌ:<br>\
(accord. to some copies of the K, and said in the<br>\
TA to be agreeable with usage:) and (tropical:)  he reproached him with disgraceful conduct. (M, K,<br>\
TA.) You say, قَشَبَهُ بِقَبِيحٍ (tropical:)  He charged, or<br>\
upbraided, him with something bad, evil, abominable, or foul. (S, O, TA.) And قَشَبَهُ بِشَرٍّ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\

(M, TA.) And قَشَبَهُ بِعَيْبِ نَفْسِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He imputed<br>\
to him, or charged him with, his own vice, or<br>\
fault. (IAar, TA.) And قَشَبَنَا (assumed tropical:)  He reproached,<br>\

with kesr; (O, as on the authority of Fr;) He<br>\
(a man, S, M, O) gained, or acquired, praise or<br>\

قَشَاَبةٌ, (K,) It (a garment, Th, M, TA) was new<br>\
and clean: (Th, M, TA:) or it was white and<br>\

my copy of the TA,) or قَشِبَ, (thus in a copy of<br>\
the M,) It (a thing) was, or became, unclean,<br>\

dirty, or filthy. (M, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\

8<br>\
إِقْتَشَبَ see 1, last sentence but two.<br>\
10<br>\
استقشبهُ He deemed it (i. e. a thing) unclean,<br>\
dirty, or filthy. (M, TA.)<br>\
قَشْبٌ inf. n. of قَشَبَ [q. v.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [The explanations of this word by Golius and Freytag, by the<br>\
former as an epithet applied in two contr. senses<br>\
to a sword, and by the latter as a subst. (from a<br>\
misstatement in the TK mentioned above), are<br>\
erroneous.]<br>\
قِشْبٌ Poison; (S, M, Mgh, O, K;) because<br>\
consisting of things mixed together; (Mgh;) as<br>\
also ↓ قَشَبٌ: (M, K:) pl. of the former أَقْشَابٌ.<br>\
(S, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence, app.,] A certain plant,<br>\
(M, O, K,) resembling the مَقِر, (M, [which is<br>\
generally said to mean the aloe, and by AHn to<br>\
be a certain plant consisting of leaves without<br>\
branches, agreeably with what follows, in the O<br>\
and K resembling the مَفْد,]) from the middle<br>\
whereof there rises a stalk, which, when it grows<br>\
tall, bends down its top by reason of its succulence,<br>\
or suppleness; having upon its head a fruit (ثَمَرَةٌ,<br>\
M, O, [in the TA عقدة,]) with which birds of<br>\
prey are killed, (M, O,) being poisoned therewith<br>\
by its being put into flesh and thrown where they<br>\
alight: he who prepares it stops up his nose; if<br>\
he do not, it injures him; and people fear to<br>\
pasture their cattle near to the places of its growth<br>\
lest the animals should come in contact with it<br>\
and should break it or bruise it and it should exhale its odour upon them and kill them: thus<br>\
says AHn, on the authority of some one or more<br>\
of the Arabs of the desert, of the Saráh (السَّرَاة).<br>\
(O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Anything unclean, dirty, or filthy;<br>\
as also ↓ قَشَبٌ: (M, TA:) or anything that is<br>\
deemed unclean, dirty, or filthy. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Rust<br>\

sword. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  The refuse, that is thrown<br>\
away, as being of no good, of طَعَام [i. e. wheat,<br>\
or other food]. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  See also [the pl.]<br>\
أَقْشَابٌ, voce قَاشِبٌ. ―<br>\
-b7-  Also, i. e. قِشْبٌ A man<br>\
in whom is no good; (K, TA;) and (TA) so<br>\
قِشْبٌ خِشْبٌ; (S, M, O, TA;) or this means with<br>\
whom is no good: the latter word is an imitative<br>\
sequent. (TA in art. خشب.) [See also قِشْبَةٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b8-  And Dry, or tough, and hard. (M, TA.<br>\
[Like قَسْبٌ.])<br>\
-A2-  And القِشْبُ signifies The نَفْس<br>\
[here meaning جَسَد, i. e. body, as is shown<br>\
below, voce قَاشِبٌ]. (O, K.)<br>\
قَشَبٌ: see قِشْبٌ, in two places.<br>\
قَشِبٌ: see قَشِيبٌ.<br>\
قِشْبَةٌ A low, vile, ignoble, or mean, man, (IDrd,<br>\
M, O, K, TA,) possessing no good: (TA:) of the<br>\
dial. of El-Yemen. (IDrd, M, O, TA.) [See<br>\
also قِشْبٌ, last quarter.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And The young one<br>\
of the ape, or of the monkey: (M, O, K:) so,<br>\
IDrd says, some assert; (O;) but he doubted its<br>\
correctness; (M, O, TA;) and the right word is<br>\
قِشَّةٌ. (M, TA.)<br>\
قَشِيبٌ Food mixed with poison: (M, TA:)<br>\
and anything poisoned; as also ↓ مُقَشَّبٌ. (Nh,<br>\
TA.) [Hence,] نَسْرٌ قَشِيبٌ A vulture for which<br>\
poison is mixed in flesh-meat, which he eats, and<br>\
which kills him; and then his feathers are taken:<br>\
(S, O:) a vulture killed by means of غَلْثَى<br>\
[q. v.]. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  And White, (O, K,) and<br>\
clean. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, (S, M, O, K,) as also<br>\
↓ قَشِبٌ, (M,) New: (S, M, O, K:) ―<br>\
-b3-  and Old,<br>\
and worn-out: (M, O, K:) thus having two<br>\
contr. meanings: (O, K:) the former used alike<br>\
as masc. and fem.; applied to a garment; and<br>\
its pl. is قُشُبٌ [and by contraction قُشْبٌ,<br>\
mentioned by Golius on the authority of Meyd].<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And the former, applied to a sword, (S,<br>\
O, K,) Polished: (K:) or recently polished: (S,<br>\
O:] ―<br>\
-b5-  and, (O, K,) so applied, (A, O, K,)<br>\
Rusty: (O, K:) or dirty: (A:) thus, again,<br>\
having two contr. meanings. (O, K)<br>\
قُشْبَانِيَّتَانِ (occurring in a trad., O) Two old<br>\
and worn-out [garments of the kind called]<br>\
burdehs (بُرْدَتَانِ): (O, K, TA:) or, as some say,<br>\
new: (Nh, TA:) the assertion that قُشْبَانٌ is a<br>\
pl. of قَشِيبٌ, and that قُشْبَانِيَّةٌ is a rel. n. from<br>\
this pl., is one upon which no reliance is to be<br>\
placed, (O, K,) for a rel. n. is not formed from a<br>\
pl. [unless from a pl. of the class of أَنْصَارٌ]: it is<br>\
an innovated form of rel. n. (O.)<br>\
قَاشِبٌ [act. part. n. of قَشَبَ; Mixing: &amp;c.].<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  One who imputes to others, or charges them<br>\
with, vices, or faults, that are in himself. (IAar,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A tailor (O, K) who ejects his<br>\
↓ أَقْشَاب, i. e. the knots of the threads, [meaning<br>\
who spits them out,] when he ejects them. (O.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
And [A man] weak in respect of the body (ضَعِيفُ<br>\
النَّفْسِ); (K, TA;) i. e. (TA) one whose قِشْب<br>\
[meaning body] is weak, or emaciated; (O, TA;)<br>\
by his فِشْب being meant his نَفْس [as syn. with<br>\
جَسَد]. (O.)<br>\
مُقَشَّبٌ Poison with which medicaments [or<br>\
drugs] are mixed to render it potent. (Ham p.<br>\
331.) See also قَشِيبٌ, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  And,<br>\
(M, K,) or مُقَشَّبُ الحَسَبِ, (S,) (tropical:)  A man whose<br>\
grounds of pretension to respect are mixed (S, M,<br>\
K, * TA) with ignobleness. (M, TA.)<br>\
