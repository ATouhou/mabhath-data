قَرَظَهُ, aor.<br>\
قَرِظَ, inf. n. قَرْظٌ, He tanned it, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) namely, a skin, or hide, (Msb,) or a skin<br>\
for water or milk, (TA,) with قَرَظ, q. v. infra:<br>\
(Msb, TA:) or he dyed it therewith. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
He plucked it, or gathered it, from the tree;<br>\
namely, what is called قَرَظ. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  قَرَظْتُهُ a<br>\
dial. var. of قَرَضْتُهُ, in the phrase قَرَظْتُهُ ذَاتَ<br>\
الشِّمَالِ, q. v. (Fr, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [in like manner as<br>\
a dial. var. of قَرَضْتُهُ,] I cut it, or made it and<br>\
cut it according to a measure and pattern. (Fr.)<br>\
-A3-  قَرِظَ, aor.<br>\
قَرَظَ, He was, or became, a lord, master,<br>\
chief, or man of rank or quality, after being in a<br>\
base or abject state. (IAar, O, K; and T in art.<br>\
قرض.)<br>\
2<br>\
قرّظهُ, inf. n. تَقْرِيظٌ, He took extraordinary<br>\
pains, or exceeded the usual degree, in tanning it,<br>\
namely, a skin, or hide, with قَرَظ. (Z.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And<br>\
hence, (see 6,)] (tropical:)  He praised, or eulogized, him,<br>\
he, the latter, being living; (S, K, TA;) تَأْبِينٌ<br>\
signifying the “ doing so when the man is dead; ”<br>\
(S;) the former signifies he did so truly or falsely.<br>\
(K.) And فُلَانٌ يُقَرِّظُ صَاحِبَهُ, and يُقَرِّضُهُ, (tropical:)  Such<br>\
a one praises his companion, falsely or truly.<br>\
(AZ, S, TA.) And يُقَرِّظُنِى بِمَا لَيْسَ فِىَّ (tropical:)  [He<br>\
praises me for that which is not in me]. (TA,<br>\
from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He praised him immoderately: like فرّطهُ. (O in art. فرط.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also,<br>\
[like قرّضهُ,] (assumed tropical:)  He dispraised him: (Kitáb el-Addád, cited by Freytag:) or it relates only to<br>\
praise and good; but تَقْرِيضٌ relates to good and<br>\
to evil. (TA in art. قرض.)<br>\
6<br>\
هُمَا يَتَقَارَظَانِ المَدْحَ (tropical:)  They two praise each<br>\
other; (S, K, TA;) from 2 in the first of the<br>\
senses assigned to it above; each embellishing the<br>\
other like as the قَارِظ embellishes the skin, or hide;<br>\
(Z, TA;) and يتقارضان is like it: (TA;) and<br>\
you say also, هُمَا يَتَقَارَظَانِ الخَيْرَ والشَّرَّ [They two<br>\
interchange good and evil, each with the other];<br>\
as also يتقارضان: (IKh, in TA, art. قرض:) or<br>\
تَقَارُظٌ relates only to praise and good; but تَقَارُضٌ,<br>\
to good and evil. (TA.)<br>\
قَرَظٌ, accord. to some, (Msb,) The leaves of the<br>\
سَلَم [mimosa flava], (Lth, S, Mgh, K,) with<br>\
which they tan; (Lth, S, Mgh;) but this assertion is [said to be] inaccurate; for the leaves are<br>\
called خَبَط, and camels are fed with them, and<br>\
they are not used for tanning: some say, that it<br>\
is a kind of tree; but this also is inaccurate; for<br>\
one says, “I plucked, or gathered, قَرَظ; ” and<br>\
trees are not plucked, or gathered: (Msb:) AHn<br>\
[contradicts this, however, for he applies this<br>\
word to a kind of tree, and] says, it is the best of<br>\
things with which hides are tanned in the land of<br>\
the Arabs; and these are tanned with its leaves<br>\
and its fruit: [the pods of the سَنْط, which is also<br>\
called قَرَظ, are used for tanning;] and in one<br>\
place he says, it is a large kind of trees, having<br>\
thick stems (سوق [app. a mistranscription for شَوْك,<br>\
thorns,]) resembling the walnut-tree, [in the Mgh,<br>\
evidently from the same source, “or, as some say,<br>\
a large kind of trees, having thick thorns (شوْك),<br>\
resembling the walnut-tree,”] the leaves of which<br>\
are smaller than those of the apple-tree, and it has<br>\
grains which are put into balances [for weights,<br>\
like as are those of the carob-tree]: it grows in<br>\
the low plains: (TA:) or a kind of tree, whereof<br>\
the سَنْط [mimosa Nilotica, also called acacia<br>\
Nilotica,] is a species: (M, K, in art. سنط:) [or,]<br>\
correctly speaking, it is [the fruit, or seed with its<br>\
pericarp, of that tree;] a well-known grain, which<br>\
comes forth in envelopes, like lentils, from the trees<br>\
called عِضَاه; (Msb;) or, [to speak more precisely,] the fruit of the سَنْط, whence is expressed<br>\
أَقَاقِيَا [acacia, i. e. succus acaciæ]; (K;) which is<br>\
termed عُصَارَةُ القَرَظِ, [and when inspissated, رُبُّ<br>\
القَرَظِ,] and has an acrid property; the best<br>\
thereof is that which is sweet in odour, heavy, hard,<br>\
and green; and it strengthens relaxed members,<br>\
when cooked in water, and poured upon them:<br>\
(Ibn-Jezleh, TA:) [the last application is that<br>\
which commonly obtains in the present day: see<br>\
also &#39;Abd-el-Lateef, pp. 48-52 of the Arabic<br>\
text, and De Sacy&#39;s translation and notes:] the<br>\
n. un. is قَرَظَةٌ: (AHn, Mgh, Msb:) and the dim.<br>\
of this is قُرَيْظَةٌ. (AHn, Msb.) Hence بِلَادُ القَرَظِ,<br>\
applied to El-Yemen, because the قَرَظ grows there<br>\
[most plentifully]. (S.) See also صَمْعٌ.<br>\
قَرَظِىٌّ The dye (صِبْغ [a mistranscription for<br>\
دِبْع i. e. tan]) of the قَرَظ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also<br>\
مَقْرُوظٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  إِبِلٌ قَرَظِيَّةٌ Camels that eat قَرَظ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  كبش قَرَظِىٌّ and قُرَظِىٌّ A ram of El-Yemen;<br>\
because the قَرَظ grows there [most plentifully].<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
قَرَّاظٌ A seller of قَرَظ. (Msb, K.)<br>\
قَارِظٌ A plucker, or gatherer, of قَرَظ. (S, Msb,<br>\
K.) It is said in a proverb, (S,) لَا آتِيكَ أَوْ يَؤُوبُ<br>\
القَارِظُ العَنَزِىُّ [I will not come to thee unless the<br>\
gatherer of قرظ, of the tribe of &#39;Anazeh, return]:<br>\
(S, K, but in the latter العنزى is omitted:) and<br>\
Aboo-Dhu-eyb says,<br>\
وَحَتَّى يَؤُوبَ القَارِظَانِ كِلَاهُمَا<br>\
[And until the two gatherers of قرظ return, each<br>\
of them]: (S:) the قَارِظَانِ were two men of the<br>\
tribe of &#39;Anazeh, who went forth in search of قَرَظ,<br>\
and did not return. (S, K.) We also find in the<br>\
M, لَا آتِيكَ القَارِظَ العَنَزِىَّ, i. e. I will not come to<br>\
thee as long as the gatherer of قرظ, of the tribe of<br>\
&#39;Anazeh, is absent: القارظ العنزى being made to<br>\
occupy the place of الدَّهْرَ, and being put in the<br>\
accus. case as an adverbial expression, by an<br>\
extension of the signification, of which there are<br>\
parallel instances. (TA.)<br>\
تَقْرِيظ: see 2. [Used as a subst., (tropical:)  An encomium, or eulogy, on a living person: pl. تَقَارِيظُ and<br>\
تَقْرِيظَاتٌ.]<br>\
مُقْرَظٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
مَقْرُوظٌ A skin, or hide, tanned with قَرَظ; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) as also ↓ قَرَظِىٌّ; and AHn mentions,<br>\
on the authority of Aboo-Mis-hal, ↓ مُقْرَظٌ, as<br>\
though from أَقْرَظَهُ, which, he says, we have not<br>\
heard: (TA:) or dyed therewith. (K.)<br>\
