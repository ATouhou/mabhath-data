قَصَّهُ, (S, M, A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
قَصُ3َ, inf. n. قَصٌّ,<br>\
(M, Msb,) He cut it; (S, Msb;) or he clipped<br>\
it, or shore it, or cut off from it; (A, K;)<br>\
namely, hair, (S, M, A, K,) and wool, (M,) and<br>\
plumage, (A,) and a nail of a finger or toe; (M,<br>\
K;) with the مِقَصّ, q. v.: (A, K:) as also<br>\
↓ قصّصهُ, (M, A,) and, by permutation, قَصَّاهُ: (M:)<br>\
or these two forms have an intensive signification:<br>\
or you say, الظُّفْرَ وَنَحْوَهُ ↓ قَصَّيْتُ, meaning, I<br>\
pared the nail and the like. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also,<br>\
He (a weaver) cut off from it, namely, a garment, or piece of cloth, its unwoven end, or<br>\
extremity, consisting of warp without woof. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And He cut off the extremities of his ears.<br>\
(IAar, M.) قُصِّيهِ occurs in a trad., as meaning,<br>\
Take thou from the extremities of his ears. (TA.)<br>\
[But this may be from the root قصو, q. v.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And [hence,] قَصَّ اللّٰهُ خَطَايَاهُ (assumed tropical:)  God diminished,<br>\
or took or deducted from, [the account of] his<br>\
sins. (TA, from a trad.)<br>\
-A2-  قَصَّ أَثَرَهُ, (S, M,<br>\
A, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
قَصُ3َ, (M, TA,) inf. n. قَصَصٌ, (S,<br>\
M, A, O, L, K,) in [some of] the copies of the<br>\
K قَصِيصٌ, but the former is the right, (TA,) and<br>\
قَصٌّ, (T, M, K,) He followed, or followed after,<br>\
his track, or footsteps, in pursuit; endeavoured to<br>\
trace him, or track him; (S, M, A, Msb, K,<br>\
&amp;c.;) or he did so by degrees: (TA:) or by<br>\
night: or at any time: (M, TA:) which last is<br>\
the correct explanation: (TA:) and قَصَّهُ signifies<br>\
the same, (A, TA,) and so اثره ↓ اقتصّ, (S, K,)<br>\
and اثره ↓ تقصّص: (S, M, K:) and قَسَّ is a dial.<br>\
form of the same. (TA.) You say, خَرَجَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
قَصَصًا فِى أَثَرِ فُلَانٍ Such a one went forth following,<br>\
or following after, the footsteps of such a one, in<br>\
pursuit. (TA.) And it is said in the Kur,<br>\
[xviii. 63,] (S,) فَارْتَدَّا عَلَى آثَارِهِمَا قَصَصًا (S, K)<br>\
And they both returned by the way by which they<br>\
had come, retracing their footsteps. (K, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] قَصَّ عَلَيْهِ الخَبَرَ, (S, M, Msb, *<br>\
K, *) and الحَدِيثَ, and الرُّؤْيَا, (A,) aor.<br>\
قَصُ3َ, (M,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. قَصَصٌ, (M, TA,) or this is a subst.<br>\
put in the place of the inf. n. so that it has become<br>\
predominant over it, (S,) and قَصٌّ, (M, TA,) or<br>\
the latter only is the inf. n., and the former is<br>\
[only] a subst., (Msb,) He related to him the<br>\
piece of news, or information, (S, M, Msb,) and<br>\
the tradition, or story, and the dream, (A,) in its<br>\
proper manner (عَلَى وَجْهِهِ): (S, Msb:) or he<br>\
made it known [to him]: (K:) and الحَدِيثَ ↓ اقتصّ<br>\
he related the tradition, or story, in its proper<br>\
manner (عَلَى وَجْهِهِ); (S, K, TA;) as though he<br>\
followed its traces, in pursuit, and related it accordingly: (TA:) [i. e., he pursued the course of<br>\
the tradition, or story:] and الخَبَرَ ↓ تقصّص he pursued, or sought after, the particulars of the news,<br>\
or information, gradually, and deliberately. (M.)<br>\
قَصَّ is also said to signify He recited, or delivered,<br>\
a [discourse such as is termed] خُطْبَة. (TA.)<br>\
And it is said in the Kur, [xii. 3,] نَحْنُ نَقُصُّ<br>\
عَلَيْكَ أَحْسَنَ القَصَصِ We explain unto thee with<br>\
the best explanation: (K, TA:) or, as some say,<br>\
قَصٌّ is the inf. n. of the verb used in this sense,<br>\
and قَصَصٌ is a subst. [syn. with قِصَّةٌ, q. v.].<br>\
(TA.) And in a trad. respecting the Children of<br>\
Israel it is said, لَمَّا قَصُّوا هَلَكُوا: or لَمَّا هَلَكُوا قَصُّوا:<br>\
accord. to different relations: meaning, When<br>\
they relied upon words, and neglected works, they<br>\
perished: or when they perished, by neglecting<br>\
works, they inclined to, and relied upon, stories.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  قَصَّهُ المَوْتُ, and قَصَّهُ عَلَى المَوْتِ, or<br>\
مِنَ المَوْتِ: see 4.<br>\
2<br>\
قصّصهُ and<br>\
قَصَّاهُ: see I, first signification.<br>\
-A2-  قصّص, (S,) inf. n. تَقْصِيصٌ, (A, K,) He<br>\
plastered, or built, (TA,) a house, (S, K, TA,)<br>\
and a tomb, which it is forbidden to do, (A, TA,)<br>\
with gypsum; (TA;) syn. جَصَّصَ: (S, K:) of<br>\
the dial. of El-Hijáz. (TA, art. جص.)<br>\
3<br>\
قاصّهُ, (Msb,) inf. n. مُقَاصَّةٌ (A, Mgh, Msb)<br>\
and قِصَاصٌ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) [which latter<br>\
is the more common,] He (the relation of a slain<br>\
man, A, Mgh, TA, or one who has been wounded,<br>\
Mgh, [or mutilated,]) retaliated upon him by<br>\
slaying him, or wounding him, (S, * Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K,) or mutilating him, (S, * Msb, K, *) so as to<br>\
make him quit, or even, with him. (Mgh.) See<br>\
also 8. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (A, Mgh,) (tropical:)  He made him quit,<br>\
or even, with himself: used in a general way.<br>\
(Mgh.) You say, قاصّ صَاحِبَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb, *<br>\
K,) inf. ns. as above, (Msb,) (tropical:)  He made his fellow<br>\
quit, or even, with him, (Mgh,) in a reckoning,<br>\
(S, Mgh, K,) or other thing, (S, K,) by withholding from him the like of what the latter owed<br>\
to him; (Mgh;) he made a debt which his fellow<br>\
owed him to be as a requital of a like debt which<br>\
he owed his fellow: [but Fei adds,] this is taken<br>\
from إِقْتِصَاصُ الأَثَرِ: and hence the former signification, relating to retaliation of slaughter and<br>\
wounding and mutilation, which, however, is the<br>\
predominant signification. (Msb.) You say also,<br>\
قَاصَصْتُهُ بِمَا كَانَ لِى قَبْلَهُ, [or, more probably,<br>\
قِبَلَهُ, or perhaps عَلَيْهِ,] (tropical:)  I withheld from him the<br>\
like of what he owed me. (A, TA.) ISd says,<br>\
(TA,) The phrase قُوصَّ زَيْدٌ مَا عَلَيْهِ has been<br>\
mentioned; and means, in my opinion, (assumed tropical:)  Zeyd<br>\
was reckoned with for what he owed: though<br>\
made trans. without a particle, as implying the<br>\
meaning of أُغْرِمَ and the like. (M, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اقصّهُ, inf. n. إِقْصَاصٌ, He retaliated for him;<br>\
(M;) as also ↓ اقتصّهُ; (A; [so in a copy of that<br>\
work; but I think it is a mistake for اقصّهُ, or for<br>\
اقتصّ لَهُ, q. v.]) or اقتصّ مِنْهُ. (TA [but this<br>\
seems to be a mistake for اقتصّ لَهُ.]) You say,<br>\
اقصّ فُلَانًا مِنْ فُلَانٍ He (a governor, or prince,)<br>\
retaliated for such a one upon such a one, (S, K,)<br>\
by wounding the latter like as he had wounded the<br>\
former, (S, Msb, K,) or by slaying the latter for<br>\
the slaughter of the former; (S, K;) and the like.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اقصّ الرَّجُلُ مِنُ نَفْسِهِ The man gave<br>\
power, or authority, to retaliate upon himself,<br>\
(K, TA,) by doing to him the like of that which<br>\
he had done, whether it be slaughter or mutilation<br>\
or beating or wounding. (TA.) [Whence the<br>\
saying,] أَقْصَصْتُكَ الجُرْحَةَ (tropical:)  I authorize thee to<br>\
adduce anything whereby to invalidate the testimony. (A, * TA, art. جرح.)<br>\
-A2-  ضَرَبَهُ حَتَّى أَقَصَّهُ<br>\
مِنَ المَوْتِ, (S, K,) and عَلَى المَوْتِ ↓ قَصَّهُ, (K,)<br>\
He beat him until he made him to be near to<br>\
death: (S, K:) and Fr used to say, ضربه حتّى<br>\
أَقَصَّهُ المَوْتَ [meaning as above]. (S.) You say<br>\
[also], أَقْصَصْتُهُ عَلَى المَوْتِ [I made him to be<br>\
near to death]. (M.) And a poet says,<br>\
فَقَدْ أَقْصَصْتَ أُمَّكَ بِالْهُزَالِ<br>\
meaning, Thou hast made thy mother to be near<br>\
to death. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Fr also said, (S,) المَوْتُ ↓ قَصَّهُ<br>\
and أَقَصَّهُ المَوْتُ [in the L and TA قَصَّهُ مِنَ المَوْتِ<br>\
and أَقَصَّهُ مِنْهُ, which seems to be a mistranscription,] both signifying Death became near to him:<br>\
(S, K:) or he became at the point of death, and<br>\
then escaped; (TA;) and so أَقَصَّتْهُ شَعُوبُ: (M:)<br>\
and أَقَصَّ على المَوْتِ he became at the point of<br>\
death. (M.)<br>\
5<br>\
تقصّص and<br>\
تَقَصَّى: see 8.<br>\
-A2-  تقصّص أَثَرَهُ:<br>\
see قَصَّ اثره. ―<br>\
-b2-  تقصّص الخَبَرَ: see قَصَّ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
الخَبَرَ. ―<br>\
-b3-  تقصّص كَلَامَهُ He preserved in his<br>\
memory his speech, or discourse. (AZ, M, K.)<br>\
6<br>\
تقاصّوا They made themselves quits, or even,<br>\
one with another, by retaliation, (M, TA,) slaying<br>\
for slaying, or wounding for wounding. (M.)<br>\
A poet says,<br>\
فَرُمْنَا القِصَاصَ وَكَانَ التَّقَاص<br>\
صُ حُكْمًا وَعَدْلًا عَلَى الْمُسْلِمِينَا<br>\
[And we sought retaliation so as to make a party<br>\
quit, or even, with us; for people&#39;s making themselves quits, or even, one with another, by retaliation, is a statute, and an act of justice, appointed<br>\
to the Muslims]: in which التَّقَاصُّ is an instance<br>\
of a deviation from a general rule, as it presents<br>\
two quiescent letters together in poetry; wherefore some relate it differently, saying, القِصَاصُ:<br>\
and there is no other instance of the kind excepting one verse cited by Akh:<br>\
وَلَوْلَا خِدَاشٌ أَخَدْتُ دَوَاب<br>\
بَ سَعْدٍ وَلَمْ أَعْطِهِ مَا عَلَيْهَا<br>\
but Aboo-Is-hák thinks, that, if this verse be<br>\
genuine, the right reading is دَوَابِبَ سَعْدٍ, as the<br>\
making the duplication of a letter distinct is allowable in poetry; or رَوَاحِلَ سَعْدٍ. (M, TA.) This is the<br>\
primary signification of the verb. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
hence, (A, * Mgh, * TA,) [or, accord. to Fei, the<br>\
reverse is the case, (see 3,)] (tropical:)  They made themselves quits, or even, one with another, in a<br>\
reckoning, (S, A, Mgh, K,) or other thing (S,<br>\
A, K) one withholding from another the like of<br>\
what the latter owed him. (Mgh.)<br>\
8<br>\
اقتصّ It (hair [or the like]) was, or became,<br>\
cut, or clipped, or shorn, (M, TA,) with the مِقَصّ;<br>\
(TA;) as also ↓ تقصّص and تَقَصَّى. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
اقتصّ أَثَرَهُ: see قَصَّ اثره. ―<br>\
-b2-  اقتصّ الحَدِيثَ: see<br>\
قَصَّ عَلَيْهِ الخَبَرَ.<br>\
-A3-  He retaliated, slaying for<br>\
slaying, or wounding for wounding. (M.) You<br>\
say, اقتصّ لِفُلَانٍ مِنْ فُلَانٍ (S, A, K) He retaliated<br>\
for such a one upon such a one, by wounding the<br>\
latter like as he had wounded the former, or by<br>\
slaying the latter for the slaughter of the former,<br>\
(S, K, TA,) and the like; (TA;) as also مِنْهُ ↓ أَقَصَّهُ.<br>\
(S, K.) [See the latter verb, first signification.]<br>\
And ↓ أَفَصَّهُ, inf. n. إِقْصَاصٌ, signifies [also] He<br>\
(the Sultán) slew him in retaliation. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
اِقْتِصَاصٌ, as a subst., [i. e., having no verb corresponding to the signification here following,<br>\
though I do not see how this can be asserted, for<br>\
one may certainly say اُقْتُصَّ مِنْهُ,] also signifies<br>\
The being done to like as one has done, whether it<br>\
be slaughter or mutilation or beating or wounding.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 10.<br>\
10<br>\
استقصّ He sought, or demanded, retaliation,<br>\
i. e., slaying for slaying, or wounding for wounding. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  استقصّهُ He asked of him to retaliate for him: (S, A, Msb, K:) and ↓ اقتصّهُ<br>\
signifies the same accord. to the K; but the author<br>\
has been misled into saying this by misunderstanding the following passage in the O; تقصّص<br>\
اثره مثل قَصَّهُ واقتصّهُ واستقصّهُ سَأَلَهُ أَنْ يُقِصَّهُ, in<br>\
which واقتصّه terminates a clause. (TA.)<br>\
قَصٌّ (M, K) and ↓ قَصَصٌ (M, TA) What is cut,<br>\
or clipped, or shorn, of the wool of a sheep. (M,<br>\
K, TA.) See also قُصَاصَةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also, both words,<br>\
(S, M, A, K,) and ↓ قَصْقَصٌ (M, TA) The breast<br>\
(M, A, K) of anything: (M:) or the head<br>\
thereof, (S, K,) called in Persian سر سينه [i. e.<br>\
سَرْسِينَهْ, applied to the pit at the head of the<br>\
breast]; and such is the قَصَص of the sheep or<br>\
goat, &amp;c.: (S:) or the middle thereof: (M, K:)<br>\
or the bone thereof, (M, K,) of a man or other<br>\
animal; (TA;) [i. e. the sternum;] the soft bone<br>\
into which are set the cartilaginous ends of the<br>\
[seven upper pairs of the] ribs, in the middle of<br>\
the breast: (Lth, TA:) pl. قِصَاصٌ [a reg. pl. of<br>\
the first]. (K.) Hence the saying, هُوَ أَلْزَمُ لَكَ<br>\
مِنْ شُعَيْرَاتِ قَصِّكَ, (S,) or هُوَ أَلْزَمُ بِكَ مِنْ شَعَرَاتِ<br>\
قَصِّكَ, and ↓ قَصَصِكَ, (M, TA,) [He is more closely<br>\
adherent to thee than the little hairs, or the hairs,<br>\
of thy breast, &amp;c.:] because as often as they are<br>\
cut they grow [afresh]: (As, TA:) meaning, he<br>\
will not separate himself from thee, nor canst thou<br>\
cast him from thee: applied to him who denies<br>\
his relation: and also to him who denies a due<br>\
that is incumbent on him. (Sgh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, the<br>\
same three words, (the first and ↓ second accord.<br>\
to the TA, and the ↓ third accord. to the K) and<br>\
↓ قَصِيصٌ, (K,) The place of growth of the hair of<br>\
the breast. (K, TA.)<br>\

↓ قِصٌّ, (so in one place in a copy of the M) and<br>\
↓ قَصَّةٌ and ↓ قِصَّةٌ, (M,) i. q. جَصٌّ, (JK,) or جِصٌّ,<br>\
(M,) [i. e. Gypsum;] قَصَّةٌ is syn. with جصّ (S,<br>\
Msb) in the dial. of El-Hijáz: (S:) or ↓ قَصَّةٌ and<br>\
↓ قِصَّةٌ, (K,) the latter on the authority of IDrd,<br>\
(TA,) and said by Aboo-Bekr to be with kesr,<br>\
but by others said to be with fet-h, (Seer, TA,)<br>\
are syn. with جَصَّةٌ [and جِصَّةٌ, ns. un. of جَصٌّ and<br>\

(M, L.) In a trad. of Zeyneb, occurs this expression: عَلَى مَلْحُودَةٍ ↓ يَاقَصَّةً [O gypsum upon<br>\
buried corpses!] by which she likens the bodies<br>\
of the persons addressed to tombs made of جصّ,<br>\
and their souls to the corpses contained in the<br>\
