قلنسوة: (see De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed.,<br>\

this usage is only post-classical.]<br>\

↓ قَلَسٌ, (A, Mgh, Msb, TA, and so in a copy of<br>\
the S,) the former being the inf. n., (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
and ↓ قَلَسَانٌ, (TA,) [but this last is more like an<br>\
inf. n.,] What comes forth, (Kh [accord. to the<br>\

K,) from the throat, (Kh or Lth, S, A, K,) or<br>\

قَلَسَانٌ: see قَلْسٌ.<br>\
قَلَنْسُوَةٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ قُلَنْسِيَةٌ (S, K) and<br>\
↓ قَلْسُوَةٌ and ↓ قَلْسَاةٌ (TA) A certain thing that is<br>\
worn upon the head, (K, TA,) well known; (TA;)<br>\
[a cap, generally high and pointed, but sometimes<br>\
close-fitting, which was worn by the Arabs, sometimes alone, and sometimes beneath the turban:<br>\
there was also one kind which was round, like a<br>\
melon: (see أُرْصُوصَةٌ:) and a cowl, or hood, of a<br>\
pointed form: see طُرْطُورٌ, and بُرْنُسٌ, and عَرَقِيَّةٌ:<br>\
&#39;Abd-El-Lateef applies the term قَلَنْسُوَة نُحَاس to<br>\
the cap of copper which covered the head of the<br>\
obelisk standing on the site of Heliopolis,<br>\
now called El-Matareeyeh:] the kind worn by<br>\
the Companions [of the Prophet] was such as<br>\
fitted close to the head, [not pointed, or] not going<br>\
away into the air: (K in art. بطح:) pl. قَلَانِسُ<br>\
and قَلَاسٍ (S, Msb, K) and قَلَانِيسُ and قَلَاسِىٌّ<br>\
and قَلَنْسٍ, which last is [properly a coll. gen. n.<br>\
of which قَلَنْسُوَةٌ is the n. un., being] originally<br>\
قَلَنْسُوٌ, for there is no noun ending with an infirm<br>\
letter preceded by a dammeh, wherefore the و is<br>\
changed into ى, and the dammeh into a kesreh,<br>\
and then the word becomes like قَاضٍ [for قَاضِىٌ].<br>\
(S, K.) The dim. is ↓ قُلَيْنِسَةٌ and ↓ قُلَيْسِيَةٌ and<br>\
↓ قُلَيْنِيسَةٌ and ↓ قُلَيْسِيَّةٌ: (S, K:) but not قُلَيْنِيسِيَةٌ;<br>\
for the Arabs form no dim. of a word of five [or<br>\
more] letters so as to preserve all the letters,<br>\
unless the fourth be a letter of prolongation.<br>\

-A2-  A maker<br>\

perhaps post-classical]. (TA.)<br>\
