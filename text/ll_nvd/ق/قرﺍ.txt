قَرَأَ الشَّىْءَ, [aor.<br>\
قَرَاَ,] inf. n. قُرْآنٌ, He collected<br>\
together the thing; put it, or drew it, together;<br>\
(S, O, K, TA;) part to part, or portion to portion. (S, O, TA.) [This seems to be generally<br>\
regarded as the primary signification.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence<br>\
the saying of the Arabs, مَا قَرَأَتْ هٰذِهِ النَّاقَةُ سَلًى قَطُّ<br>\
and مَا قَرَأَتْ جِنِينًا, meaning This she-camel has not<br>\
contracted her womb upon a young one: (S, O,<br>\
TA:) but most say that the meaning is, her<br>\
womb has not comprised, or enclosed, a fœtus: or<br>\
the former saying means she has not borne a fœtus:<br>\
accord. to AHeyth, this same saying and مَا قَرَأَتْ<br>\
مَلْقُوحًا are both said to mean, by some, she has<br>\
not borne in her womb a young one (??): and by<br>\
some, she has not let fall a young one, ever; i. e.<br>\
she has not been pregnant: and accord. to ISh,<br>\
one says, ↓ ضَرَبَ الفَحْلُ النَّاقَةَ عَلَى غَيْرِ قَرْءٍ [which<br>\
seems to mean The stallion covered the she-camel<br>\
without her bringing forth, or becoming pregnant;<br>\
for he adds that قرء الناقة means ضعتها; app. ضَعَتُهَا<br>\
or ضِعَتُهَا; but I have not found ضَعَةٌ nor ضِعَةٌ<br>\
among the inf. ns. of وَضَعَتْ meaning “ she<br>\
brought forth; ” and I rather think that the right<br>\
reading is ضَغَنُهَا or ضِغْنُهَا, and that the meaning<br>\
therefore is, without her inclining, or being desirous: see 10, third sentence; and see قَرْءُ الفَرَسِ]:<br>\
and there is another saying; that لَمْ تَقْرَأْ جَنِينًا<br>\
means She has not, or did not, cast forth a fœtus,<br>\
or a young one. (TA.) One says also, of the<br>\
she-camel, (K, TA,) and of the ewe, or she-goat,<br>\
(TA,) قَرَأَتْ, alone, meaning She became pregnant:<br>\
(K, TA:) and likewise, of the pregnant [in<br>\
general], or of the she-camel, accord. to different<br>\
copies of the K, (TA,) meaning she brought forth:<br>\
(K, TA:) ISh says that قَرَأَتْ is used in relation<br>\
to a she-camel; and ↓ أَقْرَأَتْ, in relation to a<br>\
woman: [each, app., in the former sense and in<br>\
the latter:] and that one says ↓ نَاقَةٌ قَارِئٌ; pl.<br>\
نُوقٌ قَوَارِئُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 4.<br>\
-A2-  قَرَأَ الكِتَابِ,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, * K, *) and بِهِ, (Msb, * K,) the verb<br>\
being trans. by itself and by means of ب, or this<br>\
particle is redundant, (Msb,) and sometimes the<br>\
ء is suppressed, so that one says [قَرَى and] قَرَيْتُ<br>\
&amp;c., (TA,) aor.<br>\
قَرَاَ and<br>\
قَرُاَ, (K,) the latter aor. on<br>\
the authority of Ez-Zejjájee, as is said in the L,<br>\
but generally ignored, (TA,) inf. n. قِرَآءَةٌ and قُرْآنٌ<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K) and قَرْءٌ, (Msb, K,) this last<br>\
mentioned by Az; (Msb;) and ↓ اقترأهُ; (K;)<br>\
He read [the book, or Scripture], or recited [it]:<br>\
(K, TA:) or قَرَأْتُ القُرْآنَ means [properly, or<br>\
etymologically, accord. to some,] I uttered [the<br>\
words of] the Kur-án in a state of combination<br>\
[or uninterruptedly]; (O, TA;) as Ktr is related<br>\
to have said: (O:) [or قَرَأَ as used in a case of<br>\
this kind app. signifies properly he read, or<br>\
recited, the Scripture chanting; like as أَنْشَدَ<br>\
properly signifies “ he recited ” poetry “ chanting<br>\
with a high voice: ” (for Scripture and poetry<br>\
are usually chanted:) then, he read, or recited,<br>\
anything in any manner, without, or from, or in,<br>\
a book.] It is said in a trad., مَنْ أَرَادَ أَنْ يَقْرَأَ<br>\
القُرْآنَ غَضًّا كَمَا أُنْزِلَ فَلْيَقْرَأْهُ قِرَآءَةَ أُمِّ عَبْدٍ [He<br>\
who desires to read, or recite, the Kur-án freshly,<br>\
like as it was revealed, let him read, or recite, it<br>\
in the manner of Ibn-Umm-&#39;Abd]; meaning فَلْيُرَنِّلْ<br>\
كَتَرْتِيلِهِ [properly, let him read, or recite, in a<br>\
leisurely manner, with distinct utterance, and with<br>\
moderation; but conventionally, let him chant,<br>\
in a peculiar, distinct, and leisurely, manner;<br>\
like as he did]: or يُحَزِّنْ كَتَحْزِينِهِ [let him read,<br>\
or recite, with a slender and plaintive voice, like<br>\
as he did]: or يَحْدُرْهُ كَحَدْرِهِ [let him read it, or<br>\
recite it, quickly, like as he did]. (O.) And in<br>\
a trad. of I&#39;Ab, it is said, كَانَ لَا يَقْرَأُ فِى الظُّهْرِ<br>\
وَالعَصْرِ, meaning He used not to recite [the Kur-<br>\
án] aloud in the [prayers of the] noon and the<br>\
[period of the afternoon called the] عْصر: or he<br>\
used not to make himself to hear his reciting:<br>\
as though he heard persons reciting and making<br>\
themselves and those near them to hear. (TA.)<br>\
The saying, in the Kur [lxxv. 17 and 18], إِنَّ<br>\
عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ وَقُرْآنَهُ فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَاهُ فَاتَّبِع قُرْآنَهُ means<br>\
Verily on us is the collecting thereof [i. e. of the<br>\
Kur-án] and the reciting thereof; and when we<br>\
recite it, then follow thou the reciting thereof: or,<br>\
accord. to I&#39;Ab, and when we explain it to thee,<br>\
then do thou according to that which we have explained to thee: (S, O, TA:) or the meaning<br>\
[signified and implied] is, verily on us is the collecting thereof in thy mind, and the fixing the<br>\
recitation thereof on thy tongue; and when we<br>\
recite it to thee by the tongue of Gabriel, then<br>\
follow thou the reciting thereof, and often recur<br>\
therein so that it may become firmly rooted in<br>\
thy understanding: (Bd:) [therefore قُرْآنَهُ in the<br>\
former instance means the teaching thee to recite<br>\
it; and thus we may explain the assertion that]<br>\
قَرَأَ and ↓ أَقْرَأَ are syn. in like manner as are عَلَا قِرْنَهُ<br>\
and استعلاهُ. (Sb, TA.) See 4. قَرَأَ عَلَيْهِ means<br>\
He read, or recited, to him the Kur-án, &amp;c., [as<br>\
a teacher, or an informant; (as is shown by<br>\
phrases in the Kur xxvi. 199 and lxxxiv. 21;)<br>\
like تَلَا عَلَيْهِ: and also, as a conventional and<br>\
post-classical phrase,] as a pupil, or learner, to<br>\
his sheykh, or preceptor. (L.) قَرَأَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلَامَ<br>\
and السَّلَامَ ↓ أَقْرَأَهُ are syn., (S, O, Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
signifying He conveyed, or delivered, to him the<br>\
salutation: or the latter phrase is not used unless<br>\
the salutation is written: (K, TA:) or belongs<br>\
to a particular dial.; and is used when the salutation is written, meaning he made him to read the<br>\
salutation: (AHát, TA:) the aor. of the verb in<br>\
the former phrase is<br>\
قَرَاَ, and the inf. n. is قِرَآءَةٌ:<br>\
As says that the making that verb trans. by itself<br>\
is a mistake; therefore one should not say اِقْرَأْهُ<br>\
السَّلَامَ [meaning Convey thou, or deliver thou, to<br>\
him, salutation]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5.<br>\
-A3-  And<br>\
see 4, first quarter.<br>\
2<br>\
قرّأت جَارِيَةً She kept at her abode a girl, or<br>\
young woman, until she should menstruate, in order<br>\
to find if she were free from pregnancy. (Aboo-<br>\
&#39;Amr Ibn-El-&#39;Alà, S, O.) And قِرّئَتْ She was<br>\
kept in confinement [for the purpose above mentioned, or] in order that the termination of her<br>\
menstruations might be waited for, or awaited,<br>\
(K,) or until the termination of her عِدَّة [q. v.].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
قارأهُ, (O, K.) inf. n. مُقَارَأَةٌ and قِرَآءٌ, (K,)<br>\
He read, or studied, with him, each of them<br>\
teaching the other. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is said of the<br>\
[ch. of the Kur-án entitled] سُورَةُ الأَحْزَاب, as<br>\
Ibn-Háshim related that trad., إِنْ كَانَتْ لَتُقَارِئُ<br>\
سُورَةَ البَقَرَةِ هِىَ أَطْوَلُ i. e. [Verily (إِنْ being<br>\
here a contraction of إِنَّ as in the Kur xvii. 75<br>\
and 78 &amp;c.)] it was equal as to the time required<br>\
to read it, or to recite it, to [that which is entitled]<br>\
the سورة of the بقرة [or it was longer]: but most<br>\
related it as commencing with the words ان كانت<br>\
لَتُوَازِى. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اقرأت, said of a woman: see 1, former half.<br>\
Said of a she-camel, (K, TA,) and of a ewe, or<br>\
she-goat, (TA,) She retained the seed of the male<br>\
in her womb: (K, TA:) and when this is the<br>\
case, one says that she is فى قِرْوَتِهَا, which is<br>\
anomalous, for ↓ فى قِرْأَتِهَا; (TA in the present<br>\
art.;) meaning in the first period of her pregnancy,<br>\
before its becoming apparent, or manifest. (TA<br>\
in art. قرو.) [And accord. to Freytag, (app. in<br>\
the phrase أَقْرَأَتْ سَمًّا,) the verb is expl. in the<br>\
Kitáb el-Addád as said of a serpent, meaning<br>\
It retained poison for the space of a month.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, said of a woman, She menstruated: and<br>\
she became pure from the menstrual discharge:<br>\
(S, O, * Msb, K, TA:) and so ↓ قَرَأَتْ, in both<br>\
of these senses, (Msb, TA,) aor.<br>\
قَرَاَ, inf. n. قَرْءٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) or in the former sense; (Akh, S, K;)<br>\
and [accordingly] one says, قَرَأَتْ حَيْضَةً أَوْ حَيْضَتَيْنِ<br>\
[so in copies of the S, agreeably with what immediately precedes, but in one of my copies of the<br>\
S and in the O and TA, أَقْرَأَت, meaning, she<br>\
menstruated once or twice]; (S, O, * TA; *) and<br>\
قَرَأَتْ signifies she saw the blood [of the menses app.<br>\
for the first time]: (TA:) and أَقْرَأَتْ signifies<br>\
she became one who had the menstrual discharge.<br>\
(Akh, S, O, TA.) [Accord. to Zj, as I gather<br>\
from the TA, the second of the significations in<br>\
the sentence immediately preceding is from the<br>\
collection of the blood in the womb: in the<br>\
opinion of IAth, it and the first signification are<br>\
from relation to time: but I rather incline to<br>\
think that the converse of this is the case, and<br>\
that hence are deduced several other meanings<br>\
here following.] ―<br>\
-b3-  اقرأت الرِّيَاحُ (S, K) The<br>\
winds blew, (K,) or began [to blow], (S,) in their<br>\
time, or season. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اقرأ (said of a man,<br>\
O, TA) He reverted, or turned back, (O, K, TA,)<br>\
from his journey. (O, TA.) And He returned<br>\
(K, TA) from his journey. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And He,<br>\
or it, approached, or drew near. (K.) You say,<br>\
أَقْرَأْتُ مِنْ أَهْلِى I approached, or drew near to,<br>\
my family. (O.) And أَقْرَأَتْ حَاجَتُكَ They object<br>\
of want approached, or drew near; or has approached, &amp;c. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And It set, (K, TA,)<br>\
said of a star: or the time of its setting came, or<br>\
drew near. (TA.) أَقْرَأَتِ النُّجُومُ signifies The<br>\
stars set: (O:) ―<br>\
-b7-  and also (O) The stars delayed<br>\
[to bring] their rain. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And اقرأ is also<br>\
syn. with أَخَّرَ, (K, TA,) in the phrase اقرأ حَاجَتَهُ<br>\
[He postponed, or delayed, the object of his want:]<br>\
(TA:) and, (K, TA,) as some say, (TA,) syn.<br>\
with اِسْتَأْخَرَ [He, or it, was, or became, behind,<br>\
backward, late, &amp;c.:] (K, TA:) [but it should<br>\
be observed that أَخَّرَ is often intrans., and syn.<br>\
with اِسْتَأْخَرَ; therefore one signification may<br>\
possibly in this instance be meant by both: such,<br>\
however, is not the case accord. to SM, as has<br>\
been shown above, and as is further shown by his<br>\
saying,] perhaps the saying of the author of the<br>\
K, that it is syn. with أَخَّرَ, may have been taken<br>\
from the phrase أَعَتَّمْتَ قِرَاكَ أَمْ أَقْرَأْتَهُ i. e. Hast<br>\
thou withheld thy entertainment for the guest, or<br>\
guests, or hast thou postponed it? but his explanation is obviously loose and defective. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-<br>\
أَقْرَأْتُ فِى الشِّعْرِ is from الأَقْرَآءُ [pl. of القَرْءُ or القُرْءُ:<br>\
hence it seems to mean I rhymed, or versified:<br>\
compare أَرْجَزَ from الرَّجَزُ, and أَرْمَلَ from الرَّمَلُ,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (O. [See also 8.])<br>\
-A2-  أَقْرَأهُ, (L, K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. إِقْرَآءٌ, (TA,) He (a sheykh, or preceptor,<br>\
L, TA) made him, or taught him, to read, or<br>\
recite; (L, K, TA;) [and so ↓ قَرَأَهُ, inf. n. قُرْآنٌ,<br>\
as shown before:] see 1, last quarter. One says,<br>\
أَقْرَأَهُ القُرْآنَ (S, O, L, TA) and الحَدِيثَ (L, TA)<br>\
He made him, or taught him, to read, or recite,<br>\
the Kur-án and the tradition. (L, TA.) Hence<br>\
أَقْرَأَهُ السَّلَامَ: (AHát, TA:) see 1, near the end.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also what next follows.<br>\
5<br>\
تقرّأ He devoted himself to religious exercises<br>\
[and particularly to the reading, or reciting, of<br>\
the Kur-án]; (S, K;) as also ↓ قَرَأَ; (O, TA;)<br>\
and ↓ اقرأ: (K, TA:) and i. q. تَفَقَّهَ [i. e. he<br>\
learned knowledge, or science; or particularly<br>\
الفِقْه, meaning the science of the law. (K.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِقْتَرَاَ see 1, former half. [After the mention of<br>\
اقترأهُ as syn. with قَرَأَهُ, it is added in the TA,<br>\
يقال اقترأت فى الشعر, in which اقترأت is<br>\
evidently a mistranscription; and not attributable<br>\
to the copyist, but to the author, of the TA, for<br>\
the whole sentence is misplaced.]<br>\
10<br>\
استقرأ الأَشْيَآءَ, (Msb,) or استقرى الاشياءَ,<br>\
(TA in art. قرو,) [both probably correct, as dial.<br>\
vars.,] He investigated the أَقْرَآء [or modes, or<br>\
manners of being, (pl. of ↓ قَرْءٌ or قُرْءٌ, and of قَرْوٌ,)]<br>\
of the things, for acquiring a knowledge of their<br>\
conditions and properties. (Msb in this art., and<br>\
TA in art. قرو.) [And one says also, استقرأ<br>\
الكتَابَ, meaning He investigated the book to find<br>\
some particular thing.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And استقرأ الجَمَلُ النَّاقَةَ<br>\
The he-camel left the she-camel (تَارَكَهَا [in the CK<br>\
and in my MS. copy of the K باركها]) in order<br>\
that he might see whether she had conceived or not:<br>\
(S, K:) [or whether she were in her state of<br>\
desire: for SM adds, after stating that this is<br>\
from AO,] as long as the وديق [i. e. وَدِيق, an<br>\
epithet which seems to be properly applied to a<br>\
female solid-hoofed animal, but here app. applied to<br>\
a she-camel,] is in her وديق [a mistranscription for<br>\
وِدَاق or a noun cognate there with], one says of<br>\
her, ↓ هِىَ فِى قُرْئِهَا and أَقْرَائِهَا. (TA. [See also 1,<br>\
first quarter; and see قَرْءُ الفَرَسِ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And استقرأهُ<br>\
signifies He desired, or demanded, of him that he<br>\
should read, or recite. (MA, TA.)<br>\
قَرْءٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.) and ↓ قُرْءٌ, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) or the latter is a simple subst. and the<br>\
former is an inf. n., (Msb,) A menstruation: and<br>\
a state of purity from the menstrual discharge:<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, &amp;c.:) thus having two<br>\
contr. meanings: (S, O, K:) said by IAth to<br>\
have the latter meaning accord. to Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee<br>\
and the people of El-Hijáz, and the former meaning accord. to Aboo-Haneefeh and the people of<br>\
El-&#39; Irák: (TA:) and a time; (AA, S, Mgh, O,<br>\
K;) and so ↓ قَارِئٌ; (S, Mgh, O;) as in the<br>\
sayings, هَبَّتِ الرِّيحُ لِقَرْئِهَا and ↓ لِقَارِئِهَا The wind<br>\
blew at its time; (Kt, Mgh;) and this is the<br>\
primary signification (IAth, Mgh, O) accord. to<br>\
AA [and some others]; (Mgh;) whence [accord.<br>\
to them] the first and second of the meanings<br>\
mentioned above: (Kt, S, IAth, Mgh, O:) and<br>\
قَرْءٌ signifies also the termination of a menstruation: and some say, the period between two<br>\
menstruations: (S:) accord. to Zj, it means the<br>\
collecting of the blood in the womb; which is only<br>\
in the case of becoming pure from menstruation:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. is أَقْرَآءٌ and قُرُوْءٌ and أَقْرُؤٌ, (S, O,<br>\
Msb, K,) the last of which [as also properly the<br>\
first] is a pl. of pauc.; (S, O, Msb;) or when<br>\
قَرْءٌ or ↓ قُرْءٌ has the first of the meanings assigned<br>\
to it above the pl. is أَقْرَآءٌ, and when it has the<br>\
second thereof the pl. is قُرُوْءٌ: (K:) respecting<br>\
the phrase ثَلٰثَةَ قُرُوْءٍ in the Kur [ii. 228], As says,<br>\
it should by rule be ثَلٰثَةَ أَقْرُؤٍ: (Msb, TA:) the<br>\
grammarians say that it is for ثَلٰثَةً مِنَ القُرُوْءِ;<br>\
thus in the L: (TA:) or they say that it is for<br>\
ثَلٰثَةَ أَقْرُؤٍ مِنَ القُرُوْءِ: but some of them say that it<br>\
is allowable to use a pl. of mult. in relation to<br>\
three and more as far as ten [inclusively] without<br>\
[the necessity of] rendering the phrase otherwise<br>\
in grammatical analysis. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
A rhyme: (Z, K, TA:) أَقْرَآءٌ (Z, O, TA) and<br>\
قُرُوْءٌ (O) signifying the rhymes of verses; (Z, O,<br>\
TA;) which terminate like as do the اقرآء of the<br>\
states of purity from menstruation; (Z, TA;)<br>\
[i. e., they are thus called] because they terminate,<br>\
and limit, the verses: (O:) and أَقْرَآءُ الشِّعْرِ signifies<br>\
also the several modes, or manners. or species,<br>\
(IAth, O, K, TA,) and metres, (IAth, TA,) and<br>\
scopes, (K, * TA,) of verse, or poetry: (IAth,<br>\
O, K, TA:) the sing. is قَرْءٌ (O, TA) and ↓ قُرْءٌ,<br>\
and some say ↓ قِرْءٌ also, and ↓ قَرِىْ and قَرِىٌّ, and<br>\
some say that it is قَرْوٌ [q. v.] with و: and the pl.<br>\
of قَرِىٌّ is [also] أَقْرِيَةٌ [a pl. of pauc.]. (TA.)<br>\
One says, هٰذَا الشِّعْرُ عَلَى قَرْءِ هٰذَا الشِّعْرِ i. e. This<br>\
poetry is according to the mode, or manner, &amp;c.,<br>\
of this poetry. (O.) See also 10, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also A periodical festival; syn. عِيدٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And A fever [app. an intermittent, or a periodically-recurrent, fever]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And i. q. غَائِبٌ<br>\
[app. meaning A thing becoming absent, or unapparent, or setting, like a star: see 4]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
And قُرْءُ الفَرَسِ means The days of the mare&#39;s<br>\
desiring the stallion: or, of her being covered: one<br>\
says هِىَ فِى قَرْئِهَا and فِى أَقْرَائِهَا [She is in her<br>\
days of desiring &amp;c.]. (TA.) See also 1, first<br>\
quarter; and see 10, third sentence.<br>\
قُرْءٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
قِرْءٌ: see قَرْءٌ, last quarter: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also the<br>\
paragraph here following.<br>\
قِرْأَةٌ The وَبَآء [by which is here meant the<br>\
common, or general, disease] (As, S, O, K) of a<br>\
country; (S, O;) of which it is said that when a<br>\
person has come to that country and remained in<br>\
it fifteen nights [or days, accord. to one of my<br>\
copies of the S,] the قرأة thereof quits him; or, as<br>\
the people of El-Hijáz say, its قِرَة; meaning that<br>\
if he be affected with a malady after that, it will<br>\
not be from the وبآء [or قرأة] of the country: (As,<br>\
S, O;) and it is also termed ↓ قِرْءٌ. (TA. [But<br>\
I think it not improbable that this last word may<br>\
have originated in a mistranscription of قِرَةٌ.])<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also 4, second sentence.<br>\
القُرْآنُ is said by some of the erudite to be<br>\
originally an inf. n. of قَرَأْتُ الشَّىْءَ meaning “ I<br>\
collected together the thing,” or of قَرَأْتُ الكِتَابَ<br>\
meaning “ I read, or recited, the book, or Scripture; ” and then conventionally applied to signify<br>\
The Book of God that was revealed to Mo-<br>\
hammad: (Kull:) it is [also expl. as signifying]<br>\
the revelation, (K, TA,) meaning that which is<br>\
termed العَزِيز [the mighty, or inimitable, &amp;c.],<br>\
which is read, or recited, and written in books, or<br>\
volumes: (TA:) used as a subst., and unrestrictedly, it is applied in the language of the law<br>\
to the substance itself [whereof the Kur-án consists], and lexically to the alphabetical letters [in<br>\
which it is written] for these are what are read;<br>\
as when one says, كَتَبْتُ القُرْآنَ [I wrote the<br>\
Kur-án], and مَسِسْتُهُ [I touched it]: (Msb:) [and<br>\
without the article ال, it is applied to any portion<br>\
of the Kur-án:] accord. to AO, (S,) and Zj,<br>\
(TA,) it is thus called because it collects and<br>\
comprises the سُوَر [or chapters]: (S, O, TA:)<br>\
and IAth says that the original meaning of the<br>\
word is the collection; and that the قُرْآن is so<br>\
called because it has collected the histories [of the<br>\
prophets &amp;c.], and commands and prohibitions,<br>\
and promises and threats, [and the like is said in<br>\
