قَبَطَهُ, aor.<br>\
قَبِطَ, so in the margin of a copy of<br>\
the S, (TA,) inf. n. قَبْطٌ, (TS, O, K,) He collected it together, or comprehended it, with his<br>\
hand: (TS, O, K:) [like قَبَضَهُ:) in the TS<br>\
given as on the authority of IDrd: in the O as<br>\
on that of IF. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, inf. n. as above, He<br>\
mixed it. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
قَبَّطَ [قبّط وَجْهَهُ He contracted his face much;<br>\
made it much contracted, or very austere or<br>\
morose:] تَقْبِيطُ الوَجْهِ is syn. with تَقْبِيطُهُ; (Yaa-<br>\
koob, K;) and is formed from the latter by<br>\
transposition. (TA.)<br>\
القِبْطُ [The Copts; often called by themselves<br>\
القُبْطُ;] a certain people, or nation, in Egypt;<br>\
(TA;) the original, or genuine, people of Egypt;<br>\
(S, K, TA;) the Christians of Egypt: (Msb:)<br>\
n. un. ↓ قِبْطِىٌّ; (S, Msb, K;) fem. with ة: (Msb,<br>\
K:) you say إِمْرَأَةٌ قِبْطِيَّةٌ [A Copt woman]:<br>\
(Msb:) and جَمَاعَةٌ قِبْطِيَّةٌ and أَقْبَاطٌ [A company<br>\
of Copts; اقباط being a pl. of قِبْطٌ]. (TA.) [See<br>\
قُبْطِىٌّ.] Authors differ respecting their pedigree:<br>\
some say, that القِبْطُ was son of حَام [or Ham], son<br>\
of نُوح [or Noah]: the author of the Shejereh, that<br>\
مِصْرَائِيم [or Mizraïm] the son of حام left issue<br>\
from لُوذِيم [or Ludim], and that لوذيم are the<br>\
قِبْط of Egypt, in the Sa&#39;eed: Aboo-Háshim<br>\
Ahmad Ibn-Jaafar El-&#39;Abbásee, the genealogist,<br>\
says, that they are the children of قِبْط son of مِصْر<br>\
son of قُوط [a mistranscription for فُوط, the Phut<br>\
of the English Bible, A. V.,] son of حام: and this is<br>\
verified by Ibn-El-Joowánee the genealogist.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
قُبْطِىٌّ A kind of thin, or fine, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
white, (Mgh,) cloth, (Mgh, Msb,) of linen, (Msb,)<br>\
made in Egypt; so called in relation to the قِبْط,<br>\
irregularly, to distinguish between it and the<br>\
man, who is called قِبْطِىٌّ: (Mgh, Msb:) so says<br>\
Lth, respecting these two forms: (TA:) you also<br>\
say, ↓ ثِيَابٌ قِبْطِيَّةٌ, with kesr; but when you convert the rel. n. into a subst, you say قُبْطِيَّةٌ, with<br>\
damm, to distinguish the subst. from the rel. n.<br>\
without ثياب; like as you say, رِمَاحٌ خَطِّيَّةٌ, and<br>\
خِطِّيَّةٌ, with kesr, when you do not mention the<br>\
رماح: so says Kh: (Msb in art. خط:) it is said<br>\
in the K, that القُبْطِيَّةُ, with damm, signifies a kind<br>\
of cloths, so called in relation to the قِبْط; and<br>\
sometimes it is with kesr; which is a plain assertion that the form with damm is the more<br>\
common: but in the S it is said, that القِبْطِيِّةُ<br>\
signifies certain white, thin, or fine, cloths, of<br>\
linen, made in Egypt; and sometimes it is with<br>\
damm, because they make a change in the rel. n.,<br>\
as in سُهْلِىٌّ and دُهْرِىٌّ, which (as SM adds) are<br>\
from سَهْلٌ and دَهْرٌ; and this indicates that the<br>\
regular form, with kesr, is the more common:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. is قَبَاطِىٌّ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and<br>\
قَبَاطِى: (K [but the latter, being indeterminate,<br>\
should be written قَبَاطٍ, like مَهَارٍ &amp;c.:]) Sh says,<br>\
that the قَبَاطِىّ are a kind of cloths inclining to<br>\
fineness and thinness and whiteness. (TA.)<br>\
قِبْطِىٌّ and قِبْطِيَّةٌ: see القِبْطُ and قُبْطِىٌّ.<br>\
قُبَيْطَآءُ: see what next follows.<br>\
قُبَّاطٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
قُبَّيْطٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
قُبَّيْطَى and ↓ قُبَيْطَآءُ, the former with teshdeed<br>\
and with a short final alif, and the latter without<br>\
teshdeed and with a long final alif, (S, Msb, K, *)<br>\
and ↓ قُبَّيْطٌ and ↓ قُبَّاطٌ, (S, K,) i. q. نَاطِفٌ; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) [described by Golius, on the authority<br>\
of an Arabic and Persian vocabulary, entitled<br>\
كتاب السامى فى الاسامى, as a very white kind<br>\
of sweetmeat, which consists of juice of grapes,<br>\
with an addition of other things, cooked so that it<br>\
becomes white and hard:] derived from قَبْطٌ signifying the act of “ collecting together. ” (TA.)<br>\
