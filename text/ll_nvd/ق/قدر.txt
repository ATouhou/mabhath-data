قَدِرَ and<br>\
قَدُرَ, [or the former<br>\
only accord. to the Mgh., as will be seen by<br>\
what follows,] inf. n. قَدْرٌ, (S, Msb,) is from<br>\
التَّقْدِيرُ, (S,) [or] it signifies the same as ↓ قدّرتُ<br>\
الشَّىْءَ, inf. n. تَقْدِيرٌ: (Msb:) [which latter<br>\
phrase is afterwards mentioned in the S, but unexplained: the meaning is, I measured the thing;<br>\
computed, or determined, its quantity, measure,<br>\
size, bulk, proportion, extent, amount, sum,<br>\
limit or limits, or number:] الشَّىْءَ ↓ قدّر signifies<br>\
he computed, or determined, or computed by conjecture, the quantity, measure, size, bulk, proportion, extent, amount, sum, or number, of the<br>\
thing, (حَزَرَهُ,) in order that he might know how<br>\
much it was. (IKtt.) It is said in a trad., إِذَا<br>\
غُمَّ عَلَيْكُمُ الهِلَالُ فَاقْدِرُوا لَهُ, and فَاقْدُرُوا; (S,<br>\
Msb; *) or إِنْ غْمَّ عَلَيْكُمْ فَاقْدِرُوا, with kesr to the<br>\
د; (Mgh, Msb; *) for فَاقْدُرُوا, with damm, is<br>\
wrong; (Mgh;) and Ks. say, that you say<br>\
قَدَرْتُ الشَّىْءَ, aor. أَقْدِرُهُ, with kesr, and that he<br>\
had not heard any other aor.: (TA:) the meaning of the trad. is, [When the new moon (of<br>\
Ramadán) is hidden from you by a cloud or mist,<br>\
or if it be so hidden,] compute ye (↓ قَدِّرُوا) the<br>\
number of the days to it, (Mgh, Msb,) and so<br>\
complete Shaabán, making it thirty days: (S, *<br>\
Mgh, * Msb:) or, as some say, compute ye<br>\
(قَدِّرُوا) the mansions of the moon, and its course<br>\
in them [to it, i. e., to the new moon]. (Msb.)<br>\

-b2-  [Hence, app., the saying,] أُقْدُرْ<br>\
بِذَرْعِكَ بَيْنَنَا See thou and know thy rank, or<br>\
estimation, among us. (AO.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence also,]<br>\
مَا قَدَرُوا اللّٰهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ [Kur., vi. 91, and other<br>\
places, meaning, And they have not estimated<br>\
God with the estimation that is due to Him: or]<br>\
and they have not magnified, or honoured, God,<br>\
with the magnifying, or honouring, that is due to<br>\
Him: (S, K:) for قَدْرٌ signifies [also] a magnifying, or honouring: (K:) or have not assigned<br>\
to God the attributes that are due to Him:<br>\
(Lth:) or have not known what God is in reality.<br>\
(El-Basáïr.) ―<br>\

measured the thing by the thing: (L, K: *) and<br>\
عَلَى مِثَالِهِ ↓ قدّرهُ he measured it by its measure:<br>\
(S, K, art. قيس:) and بَيْنَ الأَمْرَيْنِ ↓ قدّر he<br>\
measured, or compared, the two things, or cases,<br>\
together; syn. قَايَسَ; (K, art. قيس;) and so<br>\
بَيْنَهُمَا ↓ قَادَرَ. (L, art. قيس.) ―<br>\

قَدِرَ (L,<br>\
K,) and<br>\
قَدُرَ, (L,) inf. n. قَدْرٌ; (L, K;) [and ↓ قدّرهُ;]<br>\
He thought upon the thing, or affair, (L,) and considered its end, issue, or result, (L, K,) and measured, or compared, one part of it with another;<br>\
(L;) he measured it, compared one part of it with<br>\
another, considered it, and thought upon it. (L.)<br>\

قَدْرٌ, (S,) I made the garment according to his<br>\
measure; adapted it to his measure: (S, K: *)<br>\
[and قَدَرْتُ عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ app. signifies I made the<br>\
thing according to his, or its, measure; proportioned, or adapted, the thing to him, or it; for<br>\
وصفته, by which it is explained in the TA, seems<br>\
to be, as IbrD thinks, a mistake for وَضَعْتُهُ:]<br>\
and الشَّىْءَ ↓ قدّر signifies, in like manner, he made<br>\
the thing by measure, or according to a measure;<br>\
or proportioned it; syn. جَعَلَهُ بِقَدَرٍ: (IKtt:) the<br>\
primary meaning of ↓ تَقْدِيرٌ is the making a thing<br>\
according to the measure of another thing. (Bd-<br>\
xv. 60.) ―<br>\
-b7-  [Hence,] قَدَرَ اللّٰهُ ذٰلِكَ عَلَيْهِ, aor.<br>\
قَدِرَ<br>\
and<br>\
قَدُرَ, inf. n. قَدْرٌ and قَدَرٌ, (K,) or the latter is a<br>\
simple subst., (Lh, Msb,) and مَقْدَرَةٌ; (S [unless<br>\
this be a simple subst.];) and عليه ↓ قدّرهُ, (K,)<br>\
[which is more common,] inf. n. تَقْدِيرٌ; (TA;)<br>\
and لَهُ; (K;) [God decreed, appointed, ordained,<br>\
or decided, that against him; and for him, or to<br>\
him; accord. to an explanation of قَدَرٌ in the K:<br>\
or decreed, &amp;c., that against him; and for him,<br>\
or to him; adapting it to his particular case;<br>\
accord. to an explanation of قَدَرٌ by Lth, and of<br>\
قَدْرٌ and قَدَرٌ in the S, and of قَدَرٌ in the Msb:<br>\
see قَدْرٌ, below.] You say also قَدَرَ اللّٰهُ لَهُ بِخَيْرٍ<br>\
[God decreed, &amp;c., for him, good]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  Also,<br>\
قَدَرَ, (K,) aor.<br>\
قَدِرَ and<br>\
قَدُرَ, inf. n. قَدْرٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
[God] distributed, divided, or apportioned, [as<br>\
though by measure,] sustenance, or the means of<br>\
subsistence. (K, TA. In the CK, the verb is<br>\
قَدَّرَ.) Hence, say some, the appellation of لَيْلَةُ<br>\
القَدْرِ, [in the Kur, ch. xcvii.,) as being The<br>\
night wherein the means of subsistence are apportioned. (TA.) See also قَدْرٌ, below. ―<br>\
-b9-  Also,<br>\
aor.<br>\
قَدِرَ and<br>\
قَدُرَ, but the former is that which is<br>\
adopted by the seven readers [of the Kur-án],<br>\
and is the more chaste, (Msb,) He (God)<br>\
straitened, or rendered scanty, [as though He<br>\
measured and limited,] the means of subsistence:<br>\
(Bd, xiii. 26, and other places; and Msb:) and<br>\
قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ, [see Kur, lxv. 7,] inf. n. قَدْرٌ, his<br>\
means of subsistence were straitened to him; like<br>\
قُتِرَ. (S, TA.) You say قَدَرُ عَلَيْهِ الشَّىْءَ, aor.<br>\
قَدِرَ<br>\
and<br>\
قَدُرَ, (Lh, TA,) inf. n. قَدْرٌ (K,) and قَدَرٌ and<br>\
قُدْرَةٌ; (Lh, TA;) and ↓ قدّر, inf. n. تَقْدِيرٌ; (K;)<br>\
He rendered the thing strait, or distressing, to<br>\
him. (Lh, K, * TA.) And قَدَرَ عَلَى عِيَالِهِ He<br>\
scanted his household; or was niggardly or parsimonious towards them, in expenditure; like قَتَرَ.<br>\
(S.) It is said in the Kur, [xxi. 87,] فَظَنَّ أَنْ<br>\
لَنْ نَقْدِرَ عَلَيْهِ And he thought that we would not<br>\
straiten him: (Fr, AHeyth:) or the meaning is,<br>\
لَنْ نُقَدِّرَ عَلَيْهِ مَا قَدَّرْنَا مِنْ كَوْنِهِ فِى بَطْنِ الحُوتِ,<br>\
for نَقْدِر is syn. with نُقَدِّر; (Zj;) and this is<br>\
correct; i. e., we would not decree against him<br>\
what we decreed, of the straitness [that should<br>\
befall him] in the belly of the fish: it cannot be<br>\
from القُدْرَةُ [meaning power, or ability]; for he<br>\
who thinks this is an unbeliever. (Az, TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-<br>\
Also, قَدَرَهُ, aor.<br>\
قَدِرَ, inf. n. قَدَارَهٌ; (K;) and ↓ قدّرهُ;<br>\
(TA;) He prepared it. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  And the<br>\
former, He assigned, or appointed, a particular<br>\
time for it. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  قَدَرْتُ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ, aor.<br>\
قَدِرَ (S,<br>\
Msb, K) and<br>\
قَدُرَ, (Ks, K,) but the former is that<br>\
which is commonly known, (TA,) inf. n. قُدْرَةٌ<br>\
and قِدْرَانٌ, (S, K,) with kesr, (K,) but the latter<br>\
is written in a copy of the T, قَدَرَانٌ, (TA,) [and<br>\
in one copy of the S قُدْرَانٌ,] and قَدْرٌ (Ks, Fr,<br>\
Akh, K) and مَقْدُرَةٌ and مَقْدَرَهٌ and مَقْدِرَهٌ (S, K)<br>\
and مِقْدَارٌ (K) and مَقْدَرٌ (TA) and قَدَارٌ (Sgh, K)<br>\
and قِدَارٌ; (Lh, K;) and قَدِرْتُ عَلَيْهِ, aor.<br>\
قَدَرَ, (S,<br>\
K, *) a form of weak authority, mentioned by<br>\
Yaakoob, (S,) and by Sgh from Th, and said<br>\
by IKtt, to be of the dial. of Benoo-Murrah, of<br>\
Ghatafán, (TA,) inf. n. قَدَرٌ (Ks, Fr, Akh, K)<br>\
and قَدَارَةٌ and قُدُورَهٌ and قُدُورٌ, (K, TA,) these<br>\
four are of قَدِرَ; (TA;) and all that are here<br>\
mentioned as from the K, are inf. ns.; (TK;)<br>\
and عليه ↓ اقتدرت; (S, K, * TA;) or this has a<br>\
stronger signification; (IAth;) I had power, or<br>\
ability, to do, effect, accomplish, achieve, attain,<br>\
or compass, &amp;c., the thing; I was able to do it, I<br>\
was able to prevail against it. (Msb, K, * TA.)<br>\
You say مَا لِى عَلَيْكَ مَقْدُورَةٌ, and مَقْدَرَةٌ, and<br>\
مَقْدِرَةٌ, i. e. قُدْرَةٌ, [I have not power over thee.]<br>\
(S.) And in like manner, المَقْدُورَةُ تُذْهِبُ الحَفِيظَةَ<br>\
[Power drives away that care which one has of<br>\
what is sacred, or inviolable, or of religion, to<br>\
avoid suspicion]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also قُدْرَةٌ, below.<br>\
-A3-  قَدَرَ and ↓ اقتدر are like طَبَخَ and إِطَّبَخَ [meaning<br>\
He cooked, and he cooked for himself, in a قِدْر,<br>\
or cooking-pot]. (S, TA.) You say قَدَرَ القِدْرَ,<br>\
(K, * TA,) aor.<br>\
قَدُرَ and<br>\
قَدِرَ, inf. n. قَدْرٌ, (K,) He<br>\
cooked [the contents of] the cooking-pot. (K, *<br>\
TA.) And أَمَرَنِى أَنْ أَقْدُرَ لَحْمًا He ordered me<br>\
to cook a cooking-pot of flesh-meat. (TA, from a<br>\
trad.) And أَمْ تَشْتَوُونَ ↓ أَتَقْتَدِرُونَ Do ye cook<br>\
[for yourselves] in a cooking-pot, or roast? (S.)<br>\
2<br>\
قدّر, inf. n. تَقْدِيرٌ: see 1, in most of its<br>\
senses. ―<br>\
-b2-  He meditated, considered, or exercised<br>\
thought in arranging and preparing, a thing or<br>\
an affair; (T, K, * El-Basáïr;) either making<br>\
use of his reason, and building thereon; the doing<br>\
of which is praiseworthy; or according to his<br>\
desire or appetite; as in the Kur, lxxiv. 18 and<br>\
19; the doing of which is blameable; (ElBasáïr;) or by means of marks, whereby to cut<br>\
it. (T.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He intended a thing or an affair;<br>\
he determined upon it. (T.) [Said of God,<br>\
He decreed, appointed, ordained, destined, predestined, or predetermined a thing.] ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,<br>\
app., قدّر كَذَا, in grammar, He meant, or held,<br>\
or made, such a thing to be supplied, or understood. You say تَقْدِيرُهُ كَذَا Its (a phrase&#39;s)<br>\
implied, or virtual, meaning, or meaning by implication, is thus. And يُقَدَّرُ بِكَذَا Its implied<br>\
meaning is to be expressed by saying thus. And<br>\
تَقْدِيرًا is said in the sense of implicatively, or<br>\
virtually, as opposed to لَفْظًا or literally. ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
He supposed such a thing.] ―<br>\
-b6-  He made; syn.<br>\
جَعَلَ and صَنَعَ. Ex., in the Kur, [xli. 9,] وَقَدَّرَ<br>\

وَقَدَّرَهُ مَنَازِلَ And hath made for it [the moon]<br>\
mansions. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  He knew. So in the Kur,<br>\
xv. 60; and lxxiii. 20, according to the Basáïr.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  قدّرهُ, inf. n. تَقْدِيرٌ, He asserted him to<br>\
be, or named him, or called him, a قَدَرِىّ: (Fr,<br>\
Sgh, K:) but this is post-classical. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
قدّرهُ, (Msb,) or ↓ اقدرهُ, (K,) [the latter of which<br>\
is the more common,] He empowered him;<br>\
enabled him; rendered him able. (Msb, K.)<br>\
You say اقدرهُ اللّٰهُ عَلَى كَذَا God empowered him,<br>\
enabled him, or rendered him able, to do such a<br>\
thing. (K, * TA.)<br>\

i. e., he used to compute, or reckon, (يُقَدِّرُ,) [in<br>\

8<br>\
اقتدرهُ He made it of middling size; expl. by<br>\

I find it fully pointed, and immediately followed<br>\
by شَىْءٌ مُقْتَدَرٌ, thus pointed, and explained as<br>\

length or tallness or in width or breadth. ”])<br>\

from a trad.)<br>\
قَدْرٌ The quantity, quantum, measure, magnitude, size, bulk, proportion, extent, space, amount,<br>\
sum, or number attained, of a thing; (S, Msb,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ قَدَرٌ (Msb, K) and ↓ قُدْرٌ (Fr, Sgh, K)<br>\
and ↓ مِقْدَارٌ. (Msb, K.) You say هٰذَا قَدْرُ هٰذَا,<br>\
and ↓ قَدَرُهُ, This is the like of this [in quantity, &amp;c.;<br>\
is commensurate with, or proportionate to, this;<br>\
and so هذا ↓ هذا بِمِقْدَارِ]. (Msb.) And هُمْ قَدْرُ<br>\
مِائةٍ, and مائة ↓ قَدَرُ, They are as many as a hundred.<br>\
(Z, Msb.) And أَخَذَ بِقَدْرِ حَقِّهِ, and ↓ بِقَدَرِهِ, and<br>\
↓ بِمِقْدَارِهِ, He took as much as his due, or right.<br>\
And قَرَأَ بِقَدْرِ الفَاتِحَةِ, and ↓ بِقَدَرِهَا, and ↓ بِمِقْدَارِهَا,<br>\
He read as much as the Fátihah. (Msb.) And<br>\
أَقَمْتُ عِنْدَهُ قَدْرَ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا I remained at his<br>\
abode long enough for him to do thus. (Meyd,<br>\
TA.) But you say ↓ جَآءَ عَلَى قَدَرٍ, thus only, with<br>\
fet-h [to the dál, as is shown by what precedes<br>\
in the Msb,] as meaning [It came according to<br>\
measure; i. e.,] it was conformable; it matched;<br>\
it suited. (Msb.) You say also جَاوَزَ قَدْرَهُ or<br>\
↓ قَدَرَهُ [He overstepped, transgressed, went beyond,<br>\
or exceeded, his proper measure, bound, or limit:<br>\
and the same is said of a thing]. (L, art. عند;<br>\
&amp;c.) And فَرَسَ بَعِيدُ القَدْرِ A horse that takes long,<br>\
or wide, steps. (JK, TA.) [And هٰذَا قَدْرِى This<br>\
is sufficient for me.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, Estimation,<br>\
value, worth, account, rank, quality, or degree of<br>\
dignity;] greatness, majesty, honourableness, nobleness; (Msb, * TA;) gravity of character; (Msb;)<br>\
as also ↓ قَدَرٌ. (Msb.) You say مَا لَهُ عِنْدِى قَدْرٌ,<br>\
and ↓ قَدَرٌ, He has no honourableness, or gravity of<br>\
character, in my opinion. (Msb.) In the words of the<br>\
Kur, [vi. 91,] وَمَا قَدَرُوا اللّٰهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ, [for explanations of which see 1,] we may also correctly read<br>\
↓ قَدَرِهِ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  قَدْرٌ and ↓ قَدَرٌ, (S,) [the latter of<br>\

what is decreed, appointed, &amp;c.: syn. قَضَآءٌ and<br>\

and مَا يُقَدِّرُهُ اللّٰهُ مِنَ القَضَآءِ, (S,) and القَضَآءُ الَّذِى<br>\
يُقَدِّرُهُ اللّٰهُ: (Msb:) [accord. to general usage, it<br>\
differs from قَضَآءٌ; this latter signifying a general<br>\
decree of God, as that every living being shall<br>\
die; whereas ↓ قَدَرٌ signifies a particular decree of<br>\
God, as that a certain man shall die at a particular time and place &amp;c.; or particular predestination: thus القَضَآءُ وَالقَدَرُ may be rendered<br>\
the general and particular decrees of God; or<br>\
general and particular predestination or fate and<br>\
destiny. The term قَدَرٌ is variously explained by<br>\
different schools and sects: but its proper meaning seems to be that given above on the authority<br>\
of Lth.] The pl. of ↓ قَدَرٌ is أَقْدَارٌ; (K, TA;) and<br>\
of ↓ مَقَادِيرُ مِقْدَارٌ. (TA.) You say الأُمُورُ تَجْرِى<br>\
بِقَدَرِ اللّٰهِ, and ↓ بِمِقْدَارِهِ, &amp;c., Events have their<br>\
course by the decree, &amp;c., of God. (TA.) It is<br>\
said that لَيْلَةُ القَدْرِ signifies The night of decree,<br>\
&amp;c. (TA. See also 1.)<br>\
-A3-  قَدْرٌ (A, L, K) and<br>\
↓ قَدَرٌ (L) A camel&#39;s or horse&#39;s saddle of middling<br>\
size; (A, L, K;) and in like manner ↓ قَادِرٌ, applied<br>\
to a horse&#39;s saddle, between small and large; or<br>\
this last signifies easy, that does not wound; like<br>\
قَاتِرٌ: (T, TA:) and ↓ مُقْتَدَرٌ, (JK,) or ↓ مُقْتَدِرٌ, (K,<br>\
but see 8,) a thing, (JK,) or anything, (M, K,)<br>\
of middling size, (JK, M, K,) whether in length<br>\
or tallness or in width or breadth: (JK:) مقتدرُ<br>\
الخَلْقِ signifying a man, and a mountain-goat,<br>\
and an antelope, of middling make: (M, TA:)<br>\
and مقتدرُ الطُولِ a man of middling stature or<br>\
tallness; (A, TA;) as also ↓ قُدَارٌ. (K.) And<br>\
أُذُنٌ قَدْرَآءُ An ear neither small nor large. (Sgh,<br>\
K.)<br>\
-A4-  See also قُدْرَةٌ.<br>\
قُدْرٌ: see قَدْرٌ.<br>\
قِدْرٌ A cooking-pot; a vessel in which one cooks:<br>\
(Msb:) [and it very often means the food contained therein; i. e. pottage of any kind: (see,<br>\
for an ex., 3 in art. غلو:)] of the fem. gender<br>\
(Msb, K, TA) without ة: (TA:) or it is made<br>\
fem. (S, K) as well as masc., accord. to some:<br>\
but he who asserts it to be made masc. is led into<br>\
error by a saying of Th: AM observes, as to the<br>\
saying of the Arabs, related by Th, مَا رَأَيْتُ قِدْرًا<br>\
غَلَى أَسْرَعَ مِنْهَا [I have not seen a cooking-pot that<br>\
has boiled quicker than it], قدر is not here meant<br>\
to be made masc. but the meaning is, ما رأيت شَيْئًا<br>\
غلى [I have not seen a thing that has boiled];<br>\
and similar to this is the saying in the Kur,<br>\
[xxxiii. 52,] لَا يَحِلُّ لَكَ النِّسَآءُ, meaning, لا يحلّ<br>\
لك شَىْءٌ مِنَ النِّسَآءِ: (TA:) the dim. is قُدَيْرٌ,<br>\
without ة, contr. to analogy; (S, TA;) or قُدَيْرَةٌ,<br>\
with ة, because قِدْرٌ is fem.; (Msb;) or both:<br>\
(TA:) and the pl. is قُدُورٌ: (Msb, K:) it has no<br>\
other pl. (TA.) [See a tropical ex. voce حامٍ.]<br>\
قَدَرٌ: see قَدْرٌ, throughout: (where its pl. is<br>\
