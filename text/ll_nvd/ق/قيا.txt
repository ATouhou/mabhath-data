K, &amp;c.,) He vomited (Mgh, TA) what he had<br>\
eaten. (Mgh, Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence one says,]<br>\
قَآءَ نَفْسَهُ [lit. He vomited his soul], meaning (assumed tropical:)  he<br>\
died: like لَفَظَ نَفْسَهُ. (A, TA.) And قَآءَتِ الطَّعْنَةُ<br>\
الدَّمَ (assumed tropical:)  [The wound made with a spear or the like<br>\
spouted forth the blood]. (A, TA.) And ثَوْبٌ<br>\
يَقِىْءُ الصِبْغَ (assumed tropical:)  A garment that is saturated with the<br>\
dye. (S, A, O, K.) And تَقِىْءُ الأَرْضُ أَفْلَاذَ كَبِدِهَا<br>\
[lit. The earth will vomit the pieces of her liver],<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  the earth will cast forth upon her surface her treasures. (TA, from a trad.) And<br>\
قَآءَتِ الأَرْضُ أُكُلَهَا [lit. the earth vomited her food],<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  the earth disclosed her herbage and her<br>\
treasures. (TA, from a saying of &#39;Áïsheh.) And<br>\

قيّأهُ He, (a man, S, Mgh, O, Msb,) or it,<br>\
(medicine, K,) caused him to vomit; (S, * Mgh,<br>\
O, * Msb, K; *) and ↓ اقآءهُ signifies the same.<br>\

تقيّأ He constrained himself to vomit; (S,<br>\
Mgh, O, Msb, TA;) and he vomited intentionally.<br>\
(TA.) See also 10, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  And<br>\
تَقَيَّأَتْ She addressed, or presented, herself to her<br>\
husband, and threw herself upon him: (K:) or,<br>\
accord. to Lth, she affected languor, or languidness, to her husband, and threw herself upon him:<br>\
but in the opinion of Az, the verb with ق in this<br>\
sense is a mistranscription, and is correctly تفيّأت,<br>\
[q. v.,] with ف. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استقآء, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,) or استقيَأَ,<br>\
(thus in the O, in which the former is not mentioned, [and it seems from an ex. in a verse there<br>\
cited that this may be a dial. var.,]) and ↓ تقيّأ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, O, Msb, K, TA,) He constrained himself to vomit: (S, Mgh, O, Msb: [see the latter<br>\
verb above: in the K neither is expl.:]) or the<br>\
former is an instance of اِسْتَفْعَلَ from القَىْءُ [i. e.<br>\
it signifies he desired to vomit]: and ↓ the latter<br>\
signifies more than the former, i. e. he made what<br>\
was in the جَوْف [here meaning stomach] to come<br>\
forth, intentionally. (TA.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
لَوْ يَعْلَمُ الشَّارِبُ قَائِمًا مَا ذَا عَلَيْهِ لَاسْتَقَآءَ مَا شَرِبَ [If<br>\
the person drinking in a standing posture knew<br>\
what would be the effect upon him, he would desire<br>\
to vomit what he had drunk: for the drinking<br>\
and the eating in that posture are forbidden in<br>\
more than one trad.]. (TA.)<br>\
قَىْءٌ originally an inf. n.: then applied to signify<br>\
Vomit; i. e. vomited food. (Msb.) It is said<br>\
in a trad., الرَّاجِعُ فِى هِبَتِهِ كَالرَّاجِعِ فِى قَيْئِهِ [He<br>\
who takes back his gift is like him who swallows<br>\
back his vomit]. (S.)<br>\
قُيَآءٌ a subst. (K, TA) similar to عُطَاسٌ and دُوَارٌ<br>\
[and many other words of the same form applied<br>\
to maladies; indicating that it signifies A complaint that causes much, or frequent, vomiting].<br>\
(TA.) One says, بِهِ قُيَآءٌ, meaning [In him is a<br>\
complaint in consequence of which] he is vomiting<br>\
much, or frequently. (ISk, S, O.)<br>\
قَيُوْءٌ One (a man, IAar) who vomits much, or<br>\
frequently; as also قَيُوٌّ; (IAar, K, TA;) the<br>\
latter formed from the former, like مَقْرُوٌّ from<br>\
مَقْرُوْءٌ. (L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, [دَوَآءٌ قَيُوْءٌ,] Medicine<br>\

مُقِىْءٌ and مُقَيِّئٌ: see what immediately precedes.<br>\
