قَفَزَانٌ (S, Msb, K) and قُفُوزٌ and قِفَازٌ, (Msb, and<br>\
so in a copy of the K,) the last with kesr, (Msb,)<br>\
or قُفَازٌ, (K accord. to the TA,) with damm,<br>\
(TA,) or قَفَازٌ, (so in the CK,) He leaped,<br>\
jumped, sprang, or bounded: (S, A, Msb, K:)<br>\

leaped the wall]. (O and K in art. زيف.)<br>\

قَفَزَ, inf. n. قَفَزَ, (tropical:)  He (a horse)<br>\
had fore legs white as high as his مِرْفَقَانِ [properly<br>\
signifying the elbows; but here, probably meaning, as it seems to do in some other instances,<br>\
the knees], but not the kind legs. (IKtt, TA.<br>\
[And ↓ قُفِّزَ app. has a similar meaning: see its<br>\
inf. n. تقفيز below; and its part. n. مُقَفَّزٌ, voce<br>\
أَقْفَزُ.]) But see أَقْفَزُ, and قُفَّازٌ.<br>\

5<br>\
تقفّز [He put on, or wore, a pair of gloves;<br>\
as also ↓ قَفَزَ, aor.<br>\
قَفِزَ, as appears from a quotation<br>\
in the L, from Khálid Ibn-Jembeh, viz. القُفَّازَانِ<br>\
تَقْفِزُهُمَا المَرْأَةُ:] he (a sportsman [or falconer])<br>\
put on, or wore, hawking-gloves (قُفَّازَانِ): (A:) or<br>\
took or prepared for himself the reticulated iron<br>\
thing upon which the falcon sits. (TA, as from<br>\
Z.) See قُفَّاز. ―<br>\
-b2-  تَقفّزت بِالْحِنَّآءِ, said of a woman,<br>\

تقافزوا [They contended together, or vied, one<br>\
with another, in leaping, jumping, springing, or<br>\
bounding]. You say so of children playing at<br>\
the game called قُفَّيْزَى. (A, K.)<br>\
[<br>\
قُفْزَةٌ A leap, jump, spring, or bound.]<br>\
قَفَزَى A leaping, jumping, springing, or bounding. (K.) You say, جَآءَتِ الخَيْلُ تَعْدُو القَفَزَى<br>\
[The horses came running with a leaping, jumping, springing, or bounding, motion]; from القَفْزُ<br>\
[inf. n. of قَفَزَ]. (S, TA.)<br>\
قَفُوزٌ: see قَفَّازٌ.<br>\
قَفِيزٌ A certain measure of capacity, consisting<br>\
of ten مَكَاكِيك [pl. of مَكُّوكْ]; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
accord. to the people of El-&#39;Irák: (TA:) or<br>\
twelve times what is termed مَنّ: (Mgh in art.<br>\
ربع:) [see also جَرِيبٌ, in three places: and see<br>\
صَاعٌ:] pl. [of pauc.] أَقْفِزَةٌ, and [of mult.] قُفْزَانٌ<br>\
(S, Msb, K) and قِفْزَانٌ. (Fr, Sgh.) [See كُرٌّ,<br>\
throughout.] قَفِيزُ الطَّحَّانِ [The قفيز of the<br>\
grinder] is when one says, “I will grind for so<br>\
much and a قفيز of the flour itself: ” so says Ibn-El-Mubárak: or when one hires a man to grind<br>\
for him a certain quantity of wheat for a قفيز of<br>\
its flour, (TA,) or when one says, “I hire thee to<br>\
grind this wheat for a pound of its flour,” for instance; whether there be something else therewith<br>\
or not: (Msb:) what is thus termed is forbidden. (Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, A certain measure<br>\

much, or often; (A, * Msb;) [and so ↓ قَفُوزٌ, occurring in art. رفأ in the M and K, applied as an<br>\
epithet to a gazelle.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, قَفَّازَةٌ A female<br>\
slave: because she seldom remains still. You<br>\
say, يَا ابْنَ القَفَّازَةِ O son of the female slave.<br>\
(A.)<br>\
قُفَّازٌ A kind of glove; a thing which is made<br>\
for the two hands, or hands and arms, stuffed<br>\
with cotton, (S, L, K,) and having buttons which<br>\
are buttoned upon the fore arms, (S, L,) worn by<br>\
a woman as a protection from the cold; (S, L,<br>\
K;) they are made of skins, and of felt; are<br>\
worn by the women of the Arabs of the desert;<br>\
and extend to the bones of the elbow: (L, TA:) a<br>\
pair of them is called قُفَّازَانِ: (S, L:) or a thing<br>\
which the women of the Arabs of the desert make<br>\
for themselves, stuffed with cotton, covering a<br>\
woman&#39;s two hands, with her fingers, and, some<br>\
add, having buttons upon the fore arm; like what<br>\
the carrier of the falcon wears: (Msb:) or a<br>\
thing which those women make for themselves,<br>\
covering the fingers and hand and arm: and a<br>\
thing which the sportsman [meaning the falconer]<br>\
wears upon each hand, or hand and arm, of skin,<br>\
or of felt, or wool: (Mgh:) or a kind of women&#39;s<br>\
ornament for the hands and feet, or the hands<br>\
and arms and the feet and legs: and a reticulated<br>\
iron thing (حَدِيدَةٌ مُشَبَّكَةٌ, accord. to the TA, as<br>\
from the K, but in the CK مُشْتَبِكَةٌ,) upon which<br>\
the falcon sits. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,] Whiteness<br>\
in the أَشَاعِر [or hairs next the hoof] of a horse.<br>\
(K. [See also قَفِزَ, and قُفَّزَ, and أَقْفَزُ.])<br>\
قُفَّيْزَى A certain game of children, who set up<br>\
pieces of wood, or a piece of wood, (the former<br>\
accord. to the A, and the latter accord. to the K)<br>\
and leap over them, or it. (A, K, TA.)<br>\
قَافِزٌ Leaping, jumping, springing, or bounding.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  خَٰيْلٌ قَافِزَةٌ, and قَوَافِزُ, Swift horses,<br>\
that leap, jump, spring, or bound, in their running. (K.) ―<br>\

أَقْفَزُ (S, K) and ↓ مُقَفَّزٌ (S, A, K) (tropical:)  A horse<br>\
whose whiteness of the lower parts of his fore legs<br>\
extends as far as his مِرْفَقَانِ [properly signifying<br>\
the elbows; but here, probably meaning, as it<br>\
seems to do in some other instances, the knees],<br>\
without his having the like in the hind legs; (S,<br>\
K;) as though he had gloves (قُفَّازَانِ) put upon<br>\
him: (S:) or whose whiteness of the lower parts<br>\
of the legs does not extend beyond the أَشَاعِر [or<br>\
hairs next the hoof]; as also مُنَعَّلٌ. (A, TA.)<br>\
تَقْفِيزٌ A scattered whiteness intermingling in<br>\
the shanks, as far as the knees, of a دَابَّة [meaning, horse]: a signification wrongly assigned by<br>\
Lth to تَقْفِير. (TA in art. فقر.)<br>\
مُقَفَّزٌ: see أَقْفَزُ.<br>\
