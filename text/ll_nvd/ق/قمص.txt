This beast has in her a property of raising and<br>\
putting down her fore legs together, and beating<br>\

and putting down his fore legs together, &amp;c.;]<br>\
applied to him who has become low, or mean,<br>\

(TA;) not of wool: (Sgh, K:) or by this is<br>\
app. meant that such is generally the case: (Ibn-El-Hajar El-Mekkee, TA:) accord. to some, it<br>\
may be from the skin [so called] which is the<br>\
