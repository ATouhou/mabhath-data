قَبُحَ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
قَبُحَ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. ↓ قُبْحٌ, (Msb, K,) [or this, accord. to the S,<br>\
seems to be a simple subst.,] and قَبْحٌ (K) and<br>\
قَبَاحَةٌ (S, K) and قُبُوحَةٌ and قُبُوحٌ and قُبَاحٌ, (K,)<br>\
He, or it, (a form, and an action, L, and anything, T,) was, or became, bad, evil, abominable,<br>\
foul, unseemly, unsightly, ugly, or hideous; contr.<br>\
of حَسُنَ. (S, Msb, K, TA, &amp;c.) One says of a<br>\
man, قَبُحَ وَشَقُحَ [app. using the latter v. as an<br>\
imitative sequent]: and جَآءَ بِالقَبَاحَةِ وَالشَّقَاحَةِ [He<br>\
did, or said, what was bad or evil &amp;c.]. (K in<br>\
art. شقح.) And ↓ اُقْبُحْ إِنْ كُنْتَ قَابِحًا Be thou<br>\
bad or evil &amp;c., if thou be desirous of becoming so:<br>\
and قَوْقَ مَا قَبُحَ ↓ مَا هُوَ بِقَابِحٍ He is not becoming<br>\
bad &amp;c., or will not become bad &amp;c., above the<br>\
degree in which he has become so: and in like<br>\
manner one says in similar cases. (Lh, L.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
لَا تَقْبَحُوا الوَجْهَ, occurring in a trad., means Say<br>\
not ye that the face is قَبِيح [i. e. unseemly, unsightly, ugly, or hideous]; because God formed it:<br>\
or the meaning is, say not ye قَبَحَ اللّٰهُ وَجْهَ فُلَانٍ<br>\
[expl. in what follows]. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And قَبَحَهُ اللّٰهُ,<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K, TA, &amp;c., [in the CK قَبَّحَهُ,])<br>\
aor.<br>\
قَبَحَ, (Msb,) inf. n. قَبْحٌ and قُبُوحٌ, (AZ, L, TA,)<br>\
God removed him, or may God remove him, (S,<br>\
A, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) far, (A, TA,) from good, or<br>\
prosperity, (S, Msb, K,) or from all that is good;<br>\
(L, TA;) [or from success, or the attainment of<br>\
that which he deserves or seeks; (see the pass. part.<br>\
n.;)] like as one does the dog and the pig: (AZ,<br>\
L, TA:) [or God drove him away, or may God<br>\
drive him away, like a dog: or God rendered him,<br>\
or may God render him, foul, unseemly, unsightly,<br>\
ugly, or hideous, in form: (see, again, the pass.<br>\
part. n.:)] and اللّٰهُ ↓ قَبَّحَهُ has a similar, but<br>\
intensive, signification. (Msb.) One says, قَبْحًا لَهُ<br>\
[an elliptical expression, a verb and its agent being<br>\
understood, i. e., with these supplied, (May God<br>\
decree) removal far from good, &amp;c., to him; or<br>\
(cause) removal &amp;c. (to cleave) to him; meaning<br>\
may removal &amp;c. betide him]; (S;) and ↓ قُبْحًا<br>\
(S, A) also, (S,) with damm; (A;) [i. e. foulness,<br>\
unseemliness, unsightliness, ugliness, or hideousness;]<br>\
and لَهُ وَشُقْحًا ↓ قُبْحًا; (L, K, TA;) and قَبْحًا لَهُ<br>\
وَشَقْحًا; in which شقحا is [said to be] an imitative<br>\
sequent. (L, TA: but see art. شقح.) ―<br>\
-b3-  قَبَحْتُ<br>\
لَهُ وَجْهَهُ, [thus,] without teshdeed, means I said<br>\
to him, قَبَحَ اللّٰهُ وَجْهَكَ [i. e. May God remove<br>\
thee far from good, &amp;c., for وَجْهَكَ is here put for<br>\
نَفْسَكَ, the phrase being] from القَبْحُ signifying<br>\
“ the removing far [from good, &amp;c.]. ” (AA, L.<br>\
[See an ex. in a verse cited in art. سبح, conj. 2.])<br>\
-A3-  And قَبَحَ (IAar, L, K, TA, [accord. to the<br>\
CK قبّح, and so in one of two copies of the A,<br>\
but the former is the right, as is shown by the<br>\
form of the aor. in an ex. in the TA,]) He broke<br>\
a purulent pustule (in his face, L,) in order that<br>\
the matter might come forth: (L, K, TA:) or he<br>\
squeezed a purulent pustule to express its contents<br>\
before it was ripe: (A, TA:) and [in like manner] he broke an egg, (K,) or anything. (L.)<br>\
2<br>\
قبّحهُ He (i. e. God) rendered him, or it,<br>\
bad, evil, abominable, foul, unseemly, unsightly,<br>\
ugly, or hideous. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the preceding<br>\
paragraph, near the middle. ―<br>\
-b3-  And He rejected,<br>\
or reprobated, what he said, as bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And قبّح عَلَيْهِ فِعْلَهُ,<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَقْبِيحٌ, (S, K,) He showed,<br>\
or declared, his deed to be bad, evil, abominable,<br>\
foul, or unseemly: (K:) said when a deed is such<br>\
as is blamed. (Msb.)<br>\
3<br>\
قابحهُ, (A,) inf. n. مُقَابَحَةٌ, (K, TA,) with<br>\
which مُكَابَحَةٌ is syn., (TA,) He reviled, or vilified,<br>\
him, being reviled, or vilified, by him; or he vied,<br>\
or contended, with him in reviling, or vilifying<br>\
(A, K. *)<br>\
4<br>\
اقبح He did [or said] what was bad, evil,<br>\
abominable, foul, or unseemly. (S, A, K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
مَا أَقْبَحَ وَجْهَهُ is said in reviling a man [as meaning How foul, unseemly, unsightly, ugly, or hideous,<br>\
is his face!]. (Ham p. 138.)<br>\
10<br>\
استقبحهُ He regarded him, or it, as bad,<br>\
evil, abominable, foul, unseemly, unsightly, ugly,<br>\
or hideous; (TA;) contr. of استحسنهُ. (S, * K.)<br>\
قُبْحٌ [either an inf. n. or a simple subst.; much<br>\
used as a simple subst., and ↓ مَقَابِحُ, q. v., may be<br>\
an anomalous pl. thereof, like as مَحَاسِنُ is said<br>\
to be of its contr. حُسْنٌ]: see 1, first sentence;<br>\
and again, in two places, in the latter half.<br>\
القَبَاحُ: see the next following paragraph.<br>\
قَبِيحٌ Bad, evil, abominable, foul, unseemly,<br>\
unsightly, ugly, or hideous; contr. of حَسَنٌ; (S,<br>\
L, Msb, K, &amp;c.;) applied to a form, and to an<br>\
action, (L,) and to anything: (T:) pl. قِبَاحٌ and<br>\
قَبَاحَى and قَبْحَى: fem. قَبِيحَةٌ; pl. قَبَائِحُ and<br>\
قِبَاحٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  نَاقَةٌ قَبِيحَةٌ الشُّخْبِ A she-camel<br>\
having wide orifices to her teats. (A, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
القَبِيحُ [is said to signify] The extremity of the<br>\
bone of the elbow; (S, TA;) so in the T; and the<br>\
إِبْرَة is another small bone, the head of which is<br>\
large, and the rest of it small, [the former, i. e.<br>\
the head.] compactly joined to the قَبِيح: (TA:)<br>\
or [it is more correctly expl. as] the extremity of<br>\
the bone of the upper half of the arm, next the<br>\
elbow; (K, TA;) the extremity next the shoulderjoint being called الحَسَنُ, because of the abundance of the flesh that is upon it: (TA:) or the<br>\
(??) part of the upper half of the arm; the<br>\
upper part being called الحَسَنُ: (Fr. TA:) or<br>\
the قَبِيحَانِ are the two slender ends that are at<br>\
the heads of the ذِرَاعَانِ [here meaning the two<br>\
bones of the fore arm; (TA:) or the قَبِيح is the<br>\
place of junction [of the bones] of the shank and<br>\
the thigh, (K, TA,) which are termed قَبِيحَانِ;<br>\
(TA;) and it is also called ↓ القَبَاحُ: (K, TA:)<br>\
accord. to A&#39;Obeyd, كِسْرُ قَبِيحٍ, (L, TA,) which<br>\
is composed of two syn. words, one prefixed to<br>\
the other, governing it in the gen. case, (L,)<br>\
signifies the bone of the سَاعِد [here meaning the<br>\
upper half of the arm] from the part next the<br>\
middle to the elbow. (L, TA; and thus it is expl.<br>\
in the S and K in art. كسر.)<br>\
قُبَّاحٌ A bear (K, TA) that is extremely aged,<br>\
or old and weak. (TA.)<br>\
قَابِحٌ [as part, n. of قَبُحَ]: see 1, first quarter,<br>\
in two places.<br>\
مَقْبُوحٌ, of which the pl. occurs in the Kur<br>\
[xxviii. 42]. (S, L, Msb,) Removed (S, Msb, K,<br>\
TA) far (TA) from good, or prosperity, (S, K,)<br>\
or from all that is good: (L, TA;) or from<br>\
success, or the attainment of that which he desires<br>\
or seeks; (Msb;) like as are the dog and the pig:<br>\
(AZ, L, TA:) or driven away like a dog: (ISd,<br>\
TA:) or rendered foul, unseemly, unsightly, ugly,<br>\
or hideous, in form. (I&#39;Ab, TA.) [See also<br>\
مَشْقُوحٌ, in the first paragraph of art. شقح.]<br>\
مَقَابِحُ Bad, evil, abominable, foul, or unseemly,<br>\
qualities or dispositions [&amp;c.]; contr. of [مَحَاسِنُ<br>\
and] مَمَادِحُ. (L. [See قُبْحٌ.])<br>\
