قَسَرَهُ عَلَى الأَمْرِ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
قَسِرَ, (M, S, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. قَسْرٌ; (S, TA;) and عَلَيْهِ ↓ اقتسرهُ; (S, K;)<br>\
He made him to do the thing against his will;<br>\
(S;) he forced him to do the thing: (S, K:) or<br>\
قَسَرَهُ على الامر has the former of these two significations; (TA;) and قَسَرَهُ and ↓ اقتسرهُ signify he<br>\
overcame him; he overpowered, subdued, or oppressed, him; (M, TA;) and ↓ تقسّرهُ signifies the<br>\
same as اقتسرهُ. (TA.)<br>\

قَسْوَرٌ (S, TA) and قَسْوَرَةٌ, (K, TA,) the former<br>\
a coll. gen. n., and the latter the n. un., (M,) A<br>\
certain plant, (S, M, K,) which grows in plain,<br>\
or soft, land; (M, K;) a sour plant, of the kind<br>\
called نَجِيل, which is like the جُمَّة [or full and<br>\
long hair of the head] of a man, and becomes tall<br>\
and large, of which camels are greedily fond,<br>\
(AHn, M,) and which fattens them, and makes<br>\
them plentiful in milk. (Az, TA.) Lth is in<br>\
error in saying that the former signifies a huntsman, or hunter; for it signifies a plant, as IAar<br>\
and AHn and others have said.<br>\
-A2-  See also<br>\
قَسْوَرَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
قَسْوَرَةٌ Mighty; (M, K;) that overpowers, or<br>\
subdues, others: (M, TA:) also strong; applied<br>\
to a man: and courageous: (TA:) pl. قَسَاوِرُ.<br>\
(M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  A lion; as also ↓ قَسْوَرٌ: (S, M, K:) because he overcomes and overpowers. (TA.)<br>\
So in the Kur, [lxxiv. 51,] كَأَتَّهُمْ حُمُرٌ مُسْتَنْفِرَةٌ<br>\
فَرَّتْ مِنْ قَسْوَرَةٍ [As though they were asses taking<br>\
fright and running away at random that have<br>\
fled from a lion]. (S, M.) Or it has here the<br>\
signification next following. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Hunters<br>\
that shoot, or cast: (S, K:) sing. ↓ قَسْوَرٌ; (K;)<br>\
accord. to Lth.; [and in the M it is said that<br>\
↓ قَسْوَرٌ signifies a shooter, or caster: or, accord. to<br>\
some, a hunter:] but this is a mistake; for قسورة<br>\
is a coll. n., having no sing.; and Fr says, that<br>\
in the verse of the Kur cited above, it means<br>\
shooters, or casters of missile weapons: it is also<br>\
related of &#39;Ikrimeh, that it was said to him that<br>\
قسورة signifies, in the Abyssinian language, a<br>\
lion; but he said that is signification is that<br>\
given above on the authority of Fr, and that the<br>\
lion in the Abyssinian language is called عَنْبَسَة:<br>\
and Ibn-&#39;Arafeh says قسورة is of the measure<br>\
فَعْوَلَةٌ from القَسْرُ; and that the meaning [in the<br>\
Kur] is, as though they were asses made to take<br>\
fright and run away by shooting or hunting &amp;c.<br>\
(TA.) Or, accord. to I&#39;Ab, in the passage<br>\
above cited, it has the signification here next<br>\
following. (IKt, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  The sound of men,<br>\
(IKt, K, TA,) and their voices, or cries. (IKt,<br>\
TA.)<br>\

قَوْصَرَّةٌ, which see. (M, K.)<br>\
