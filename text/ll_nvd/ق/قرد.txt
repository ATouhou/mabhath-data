proverbs: [عثرت على الغزل app. signifies she<br>\
applied herself by chance to spinning:] the proverb is applied to him who neglects a needful<br>\
business when it is possible, and seeks to accomplish it when it is beyond his reach: (K:) its<br>\
origin is the fact, that a woman neglects spinning<br>\
while she finds that which she may spin, (of<br>\

the two dáls: (S, L:) Sb says, that قَرَادِيدُ is a<br>\
