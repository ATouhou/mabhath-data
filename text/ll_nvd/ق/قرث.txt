قَرِثَ, aor.<br>\
قَرَثَ, (O, K,) inf. n. قَرَثٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
toiled; and gained or earned, or sought gain or<br>\
sustenance. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  قَرَثَهُ الأَمْرُ i. q. كَرَثَهُ.<br>\
(K.) You say, قَرَثَنِى الأَمْرُ and كَرَثَنِى, meaning<br>\
The affair, or event, grieved me; and burdened<br>\
me heavily, or overburdened me. (As, O.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِقْتَرَثَتِ البُسْرَتَانِ, and الثَّلَاثُ, The two unripe dates, and the three, grew together, intermingling. (&#39;Eesà Ibn-&#39;Omar, O and TA in art.<br>\
سخل.)<br>\
قَرْثٌ A small [leathern vessel for water, of the<br>\
kind called] رَكْوَة: (O, K:) mentioned by Th,<br>\
on the authority of IAar: (O:) فَرْثٌ is a dial.<br>\
var. thereof; (TA;) [or] this latter, mentioned<br>\
by Az, in art. فرث, is a mistranscription. (O.)<br>\
قَرِيثَى: see قَرِيثَآءُ.<br>\
قَرَاثَآءُ: see what next follows, in four places.<br>\
بُسْرٌ قَرِيثَآءُ, (Ks, S, O, K,) with the lengthened<br>\
alif and without tenween, (Ks, S, O,) and<br>\
↓ قَرَاثَآءُ; (O, K;) and تَمْرٌ قَرِيثَآءُ and ↓ قَرَاثَآءُ:<br>\
(Lh, K:) and نَخْلٌ قَرِيثَآءُ (Ks, S, O, K) and<br>\
↓ قَرَاثَآءُ: (K:) قَرِيثَآء is [thus] used as an epithet,<br>\
and it is also used as the complement of a prefixed noun; [so that one says also بُسْرُ قَرِيثَآءَ, and<br>\
app. ↓ قَرَاثَآءَ likewise, and each in like manner<br>\
with تَمْرُ and with نَخْلُ prefixed;] and it is<br>\
dualized and is pluralized; and there is no word<br>\
like it in form, except كَرِيثَآء, in which the ك is<br>\
app. a substitute [for ق]; (ISd, L;) and which<br>\
is said by AZ to be syn. with قَرِيثَآء as applied to<br>\
بُسْر: (L:) [but كَثِيرَآءُ should be added as a word<br>\
of the same form; and perhaps there are other<br>\
instances:] and accord. to Abu-l-Jarráh, one<br>\
says ↓ تَمْرٌ قَرِيثَى, (S, O,) not with the lengthened<br>\
alif, (S,) i. e. with the shortened alif: (O:) the<br>\
meaning is, A species of dates, (S, K,) of (K) the<br>\
sweetest, or best, thereof, in the state in which<br>\
they are termed بُسْر; (S, O, * K;) a species of<br>\
dates, which are black, and of which the skin<br>\
quickly falls off from the لِحَآء [or flesh] thereof<br>\
when they become ripe; as AHn says, they are<br>\
the best of dates in the state in which they are<br>\
termed بُسْر; and he adds, the dried thereof are<br>\
black: (L, TA:) [and palm trees that produce<br>\
such dates:] some say that the word [قريثآء] is<br>\
أَعْجَمِىّ [i. e. foreign or Pers.]. (TA.)<br>\
قِرِّيثٌ A certain species of fish; (S;) a dial.<br>\
var. of جِرِّيثٌ [q. v.]. (S, K. *)<br>\
