قَصُرَ, inf. n. قِصَرٌ (S, M, Msb, K, &amp;c.)<br>\
and قَصْرٌ (IAar, M, K) and قَصَارَةٌ, (Lh, M, K,)<br>\
It (a thing, S, Msb, i. e. anything, M) was, or<br>\
became, short; contr. of طَالَ. (S, M, Msb, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [And It was, or became, too short. And<br>\
قَصُرَ عَنْهُ It was, or became, too short for him, or<br>\
it. ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence, قَصُرَتْ يَدُهُ, and قَصُرَ بَاعُهُ, (tropical:)  He had<br>\
little, or no, power: and he was, or became,<br>\
niggardly.]<br>\
-A2-  And قَصَرَ السَّهْمُ عَنِ الهَدَفِ, (S, M,<br>\
Msb,) aor.<br>\
قَصُرَ, (Msb,) inf. n. قُصُورٌ, (M, Msb,) The<br>\
arrow fell short of the butt; did not reach it; (S,<br>\
Msb;) fell upon the ground without reaching the<br>\
butt: (M:) and قَصَرَ عَنْ مَنْزِلِهِ [he fell short of<br>\
his place of alighting or abode; did not reach it].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] قَصَرَ عَنِ الأَمْرِ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
[and قَصَرَ دُونَهُ,] aor.<br>\
قَصُرَ, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. قُصُورٌ;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) and ↓ اقصر, (K,) inf. n. إِقَصَارٌ;<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ قصّر, (K,) inf. n. تَقْصِيرٌ; (TA;) and<br>\
↓ تقاصر; (K;) [He fell, or stopped, or came,<br>\
short of doing the thing, or affair; he failed of<br>\
doing, or accomplishing, it;] he lacked power, or<br>\
ability, to do, or accomplish, the thing, or affair;<br>\
(S, Msb, K;) he could not attain to it: (S:) or<br>\
the first has this signification; (ISk, S, Msb;)<br>\
and [in like manner] عَنْهُ ↓ قصّر, (M, K,) inf. n.<br>\
تَقْصِيرٌ, (TA,) he left or relinquished it, or abstained from it, being unable to do or accomplish<br>\
it: (M, K:) but عَنْهُ ↓ اقصر, he desisted or abstained from it, being able to do or accomplish it:<br>\
(ISk, S, M, Msb:) such, at least, is generally<br>\
the case, though both sometimes occur in one<br>\
and the same sense, that which اقصر عنه generally<br>\
bears: (TA:) and فِى الأَمْرِ ↓ قصّر [he fell, or stopped,<br>\
or came, short in the affair: it signifies nearly<br>\
the same as اقصر عنه, i. e., he fell short of<br>\
accomplishing the affair; he fell short of doing<br>\
what was requisite, or due, or what he ought to<br>\
have done, (عَمَّا كَانَ يَنْبَغِى, or the like, being<br>\
understood,) in, or with respect to, the affair: a<br>\
meaning very common, and implied, though not<br>\
expressed, in the M: and] he flagged, or was<br>\
remiss, in the affair; syn. تَوَانَى: (S, TA:) or<br>\
↓ قصّر signifies he left, desisted from, neglected, or<br>\
left undone, a thing, or part thereof, from inability: but ↓ اقصر, he left it, &amp;c., or part thereof,<br>\
with ability to do it. (Kull p. 128.) [And ↓ قصّر<br>\
دُونَهُ He fell short of reaching, or attaining, it:<br>\
see an ex. voce يَعْقُوبٌ.] [Hence also,] قَصَرَتْ<br>\
بِنَا النَّفَقَةُ The money for expenses [fell short of<br>\
what we required;] did not enable us to attain<br>\
our object; (Msb;) meaning, that they were unable to pay the expenses: (Mgh:) and بِهِ ↓ قَصَّرَ<br>\
أَمَلُهُ [his hope fell short of what he required]:<br>\
&#39;Antarah says,<br>\
فَالْيَوْمَ قَصَّرَ عَنْ تِلْقَائِكَ الأَمَلُ<br>\
[but to-day, hope hath fallen short of extending to<br>\
the meeting with thee]. (TA.) [And hence,<br>\
app.,] بِكَذَا نَفْسُكَ ↓ قَصَّرَتْ [Thy mind, or wish, fell<br>\
short of what was requisite with respect to such a<br>\
thing], said to him who has sought, or desired,<br>\
little, and a mean share or lot. (TA.) And,<br>\
بِفُلَانٍ ↓ قَصَّرَ [He fell short of what was required<br>\
by such a one, or due to him; or] he acted<br>\
meanly, and sparingly, with such a one, in a gift.<br>\
[&amp;c.] (JK [see مُقَصِّرٌ: and see two exs. of قَصَّرَ<br>\
بِهِ voce أَزْرَى in art. زرى.] ―<br>\
-b3-  [Also, قَصَرَ عَنِ<br>\
الأَمْرِ, (M, K,) aor.<br>\
قَصُرَ, (M,) inf. n. قُصُورٌ; and<br>\
↓ اقصر; and ↓ قصّر and ↓ تقاصر; (M, K;) He refrained, abstained, or desisted, from the thing, or<br>\
affair. (M, K.) A poet says,<br>\
إِذَا غَمَّ خِرْشَآءُ الثُّمَالَةِ أَنْفَهُ<br>\
مِنْهَا لِلصَّرِيحِ فَأَقْنَعَا ↓ تَقَاصَرَ<br>\
[When the froth of the water remaining in the<br>\
drinking-trough covers his nose, he refrains from<br>\
it, turning to the clear, and raises his head]: or<br>\
منها ↓ تقاصر here signifies he contracts his neck<br>\
from it: and it is said that عنه ↓ قصّر signifies as<br>\
explained above, he left or relinquished it, &amp;c.<br>\
(M.) قَصَرَ عَنِّى الوَجَعُ, and الغَضَبُ, (M, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
قَصُرَ, inf. n. قُصُورٌ, (M,) The pain, and anger,<br>\
ceased from me; quitted me; (M, K;) as also<br>\
قَصِرَ; (M, TA;) which latter is erroneously<br>\
written in the copies of the K, قَصَّرَ: (TA:) and<br>\
قَصَرْتُ أَنَا عَنْهُ [I ceased from it]. (M.) And<br>\
الْمَطَرُ ↓ أَقْصَرَ The rain left off. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  قَدْ قَصَرَ<br>\
العَشِىُّ, aor.<br>\
قَصُرَ, inf. n. قُصُورٌ, [The afternoon, or<br>\
evening, has come,] is said when you enter upon<br>\
the مَسَآء [i. e. afternoon, or evening]: (S:) or it<br>\
means has almost drawn near to night. (TA.)<br>\
[See also قَصْرٌ, below.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (S,) قَصَرْنَا and<br>\
↓ أَقْصَرْنَا We entered upon the عَشِىّ [i. e. afternoon,<br>\
or evening]; (M, K;) the former signifies أَمْسَيْنَا;<br>\
and the latter, دَخَلْنَا فِى قَصْرِ العَشِىِّ, like as you<br>\
say أَمْسَيْنَا from المَسَآءُ: (S:) or the former, we<br>\
came to be in the last part of the day; and the<br>\
latter, we entered upon the last part of the day.<br>\
(IKtt.)<br>\
-A4-  قَصَرَهُ, (Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
قَصُرَ, (Msb,) or<br>\

TA;) inf. n. تَقْصِيرٌ; (TA;) and ↓ اقصرهُ; (Msb;)<br>\
He made it short; (M, K, TA;) he shortened<br>\
it; took from its length. (Msb.) You say قَصَرَ<br>\
الشَّعَرَ, (M, Msb, K,) and قَصَرَ مِنَ الشَّعَرِ, (S,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
قَصُرَ, (Msb,) or<br>\
قَصِرَ; (K;) and ↓ قصّره, (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA,) and مِنْهُ ↓ قصّر; (S;) and ↓ اقصرهُ; (Msb;)<br>\
He shortened the hair; (M, K, * TA;) took from<br>\
its length; (Msb;) cut its ends; (Mgh;) clipped,<br>\
or shore, it. (TA.) And قَصَرَ الصَّلَاةَ, (M, Msb,<br>\
TA,) and قَصَرَ مِنَ الصَّلَاةِ, (S, M, Msb,) aor.<br>\
قَصُرَ,<br>\

Msb, TA,) and ↓ قصّر منها, (S, M,) inf. n. تَقْصِيرٌ;<br>\
(S;) and ↓ اقصرها, (Msb, TA,) and ↓ اقصر منها;<br>\
(S;) but اقصرها is extr.; (TA;) He curtailed<br>\
[or contracted] the prayer; (M;) he performed<br>\
a prayer of four rek&#39;ahs (رَكَعَات) making it of<br>\
two; (Mgh;) in a journey. (Mgh, TA.) And<br>\
الخُطْبَةَ ↓ اقصر He made the [form of words<br>\
called] خطبة [delivered from the pulpit] short,<br>\
or concise: (Mgh, TA: *) the doing so being<br>\
commanded. (Mgh.) قَصْرٌ also signifies the contr.<br>\
of مَدٌّ; (M, K;) and the verb is قَصَرَ [He contracted, or straitened]. (M.) You say قَصَرْتُ<br>\
قَيْدَ البَعِيرِ; (Msb;) and قَصَرْتُ لَهُ مِنْ قَيْدِهِ; (M;)<br>\
aor.<br>\
قَصُرَ, inf. n. قَصْرٌ; (M, Msb;) I contracted the<br>\
shackles of the camel; syn. صَيَّقُتُهُ; (Msb;) and<br>\
I contracted his shackles; syn. قَارَبْتُ. (M.)<br>\
[And in like manner, العَطِيَّةَ ↓ قَصَّرَ, inf. n. تَقْصِيرٌ,<br>\
He made the gift scanty, or mean: or, accord.<br>\
to the TK, قصّر فِى العَطِيَّةِ, which properly<br>\
signifies he fell short of what he ought to have<br>\
done with respect to the gift: but, though each of<br>\
these phrases is doubtless correct, the former expression I hold to be that which is indicated<br>\
when it is said that] التَّقْصِيرُ signifies إِخْسَاسُ<br>\
العَطِيَّةِ. (M, K.)<br>\
-A5-  قَصَرَهُ, (S, M, Msb,) aor.<br>\
قَصُرَ,<br>\

bounds or limits, restrained, withheld, hindered<br>\
or prevented, him, or it; syn. حَبَسَهُ. (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K. *) It is said in a trad. of Mo&#39;ádh,<br>\
لَهُ مَا قَصَرَ فِى بَيْتِهِ To him belongeth what he hath<br>\
held confined in, or kept within, his house or tent:<br>\
(TA:) or what he hath held in possession &amp;c.<br>\
(Az, TA in art. خمر: see 10 in that art.) You<br>\
say also قَصَرْتُ الدَّارَ, inf. n. as above, I [confined<br>\
and so] defended the house by walls. (TA.) And<br>\
قَصَرَ الجَارِيَةَ بِالْحِجَابِ He [confined and so] kept<br>\
safe the girl by means of the veil, or covering, or<br>\
the like: and in like manner you say of a horse.<br>\
(TA.) And in a trad. of &#39;Omar it is said,<br>\
قَصَرَ بِهِمُ اللَّيْلُ, (TA,) or ↓ قَصَّرَ, (L,) The night<br>\
withheld them; namely a company of riders upon<br>\
camels on other beasts. (L, TA.) You also say<br>\
قَصَرَ الرَّجُلَ عَنِ الأَمْرِ [and قَصَرَ بِهِ and به ↓ قصّر]<br>\
He withheld the man from the thing, or affair,<br>\
that he desired to do. (TA.) [See an ex. in a<br>\
verse cited voce طَلَّاع.] And قَصَرْتُ نَفَسِى عَنْ<br>\
شَىْءٍ I withheld, or restrained, myself from a<br>\
thing: (JK, TA: *) and I restrained myself from<br>\
inordinate desire of a thing. (TA.) Lebeed<br>\
says<br>\
فَلَسْتُ وَإِنْ أَقْصَرْتُ عَنْهُ بِمُقْصِرِ<br>\
meaning, But although thou blame in order that<br>\
I may be restrained, I do not refrain from that<br>\
which I desire to do. (El-Mázinee, L.) Also,<br>\
قَصَرْتُ طَرْفِى [I restrained my eye, or eyes;] I did<br>\
not raise my eye, or eyes, towards that at which<br>\
I ought not to look. (TA.) And قَصَرَ البَصَرَ He<br>\
turned away the eye. (TA.) It is also said in a<br>\
trad. of I&#39;Ab, قُصِرَ الرِّجَالُ عَلَى أَرْبَعٍ مِنْ أَجْلِ<br>\
أَمْوَالِ اليَتَامَى Men were restricted to marrying no<br>\
more than four [because of the property of the<br>\
orphans which they might leave]. (TA.) And<br>\
one says قَصَرْتُ نَفْسِى عَلَى الشَّىْءِ I confined, or<br>\
restricted, myself to the thing, and obliged myself<br>\
to do it. (TA.) [See also 8.] Hence what is<br>\
said of Thumámeh, in a trad., فأَبَى أَنْ يُسْلِمَ قَصْرًا<br>\
But he refused to become a Muslim by constraint<br>\
and compulsion: or by force, as some say, from<br>\
القَسُرُ; the س being changed into ص, as is done<br>\
in many other cases. (TA.) You say also<br>\
قَصَرْتُ الشَّىْءَ عَلَى كَذَا I restricted the thing to<br>\
such a thing. (S, TA.) And قَصَرَهُ عَلَى الأَمْرِ,<br>\
meaning, رَدَّهُ إِلَيْهِ, (M, K,) i. e., [He reduced<br>\
him, to the thing, or affair; or] he appropriated<br>\
him [or it, restrictively,] to the thing, or affair.<br>\
(TK.) [Hence,] قَصَرْتُ اللِّقْحَةَ عَلَى فَرَسِى I<br>\
appropriated the milk of the milch-camel [restrictively] to my horse. (S, TA.) [And hence,]<br>\
قَصَرْتُ عَلَى نَفْسِى نَاقَةً I retained for myself [restrictively] a she-camel, that I might drink her<br>\
milk. (Msb.) Aboo-Du-ád says, describing a<br>\
horse,<br>\
فَقُصِرْنَ الشِّتَآءَ بَعْدُ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
وَهُوَ لِلذَّوْدِ أَنْ يُقَسَّمْنَ جَارٌ<br>\
meaning, So they were restricted to him, that he<br>\
might drink their milk, during the severity of the<br>\
winter, afterwards; and he is a protector to the<br>\
few she-camels from their being suddenly attacked<br>\
and divided in shares; مِنْ being understood before أَنْ. (M.)<br>\
-A6-  قَصَرَ الثَّوْبَ, (S, M, Msb,) aor.<br>\
قَصُرَ,<br>\
(S,) inf. n. قَصْرٌ (S, Mgh, Msb) and قِصَارَةٌ; (Sb,<br>\

He beat, (S, TA,) washed, (Mgh,) and whitened,<br>\

أَقْصَرَ see 1, throughout.<br>\
-A2-  أَقْصَرَتْ She<br>\
brought forth short children: hence the saying,<br>\
إِنَّ الطَّوِيلَةَ قَدْ تُقْصِرُ وَإِنَّ القَصِيرَةَ قَدْ تُطِيلُ [Verily<br>\
the tall woman sometimes brings forth short children, and verily the short woman sometimes brings<br>\
forth tall children]. (S, K. *) J is in error in<br>\
saying that this is in a trad. (Sgh, K.) But<br>\
IAth also asserts it to be a trad. (MF in art.<br>\
طول.)<br>\
6<br>\
تقاصر He feigned, or pretended, (أَظْهَرَ,)<br>\
shortness; (M, Sgh, K;) as also ↓ تَقَوْصَرَ: (Sgh,<br>\
K:) or, accord. to some, these two verbs have<br>\
different significations: see the latter below.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And He contracted himself, or drew<br>\
himself together. (See R. Q. 1 in art. فذ.)] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
تقاصرت نَفْسُهُ (assumed tropical:)  He (lit. his spirit, or soul,)<br>\
became abject, mean, contemptible, or despicable; syn. تَضَآءَلَتْ. (M.) ―<br>\

exceed it. (M, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  اقتصر عَلَى الشَّىْءِ, (S,) or<br>\
على كَذَا, (Msb,) [and بِكَذَا,] He was satisfied,<br>\
or content, (S, Msb,) with the thing, (S,) or with<br>\
such a thing. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  اقتصر عَلَى أَمْرِى He<br>\
obeyed my command. (JK.)<br>\
10<br>\
استقصرهُ He reckoned, or held, him, or it,<br>\
to be short. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He reckoned him, or held<br>\
him, to fall short of doing what he ought to do: or<br>\
to flagg, or be remiss: عَدَّهُ مُقَصِّرًا. (S.)<br>\
Q. Q. 2<br>\
تَقَوْصَرَ, said of a man, (M,) He<br>\
became contracted; lit., one part of him entered<br>\
into another part; (M, K;) as though he became<br>\
like a قَوْصَرَّة, from which word the verb is derived. (Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 6.<br>\
قَصْرٌ and ↓ قَصَرٌ and ↓ قُصْرَةٌ [like the inf. n. قُصُورٌ]<br>\
The falling, or stopping, or coming, short of accomplishing an affair; or of doing what one<br>\
ought, or is commanded, to do; or flagging, or<br>\
remissness: you say to a man whom you have<br>\
sent to accomplish some needful affair, and who<br>\
has fallen short of doing what you commanded<br>\
him to do, on account of heat or some other<br>\
cause, مَا مَنَعَكَ أَنْ تَبْلُغَ المَكَانَ الَّذِى أَمَرْتُكَ بِهِ إِلَّا<br>\
أَنَّكَ أَحْبَبْتَ القَصْرَ, and القَصَرَ, and القُصْرَةَ, i. e. أَنْ<br>\
تُقَصِّرَ [Nothing prevented thy reaching the place<br>\
to which I commanded thee to go but thy loving<br>\
to fall short &amp;c.; or to flag, or be remiss]. (M,<br>\
K *.) And ↓ قَصَرَةٌ, (K,) or ↓ قَصَرٌ, without ة, accord.<br>\
to the Nawádir of IAar, as cited in the L, and<br>\
so in the handwriting of Sgh, (TA,) and ↓ قَصَارٌ,<br>\
(K,) signify Laziness; slothfulness. (IAar, Sgh,<br>\
K.) An Arab of the desert is related to have<br>\
said ↓ أَرَدْتُ أَنْ آتِيَكَ فَمَنَعَنِى القَصَارُ [I desired to<br>\
come to thee, but laziness prevented me]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  قَصْرُكَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا and ↓ قَصَارُكَ, (S, M, K,)<br>\
and ↓ قُصَارُكَ, (M, K,) and ↓ قُصَارَاكَ, (S, M, K,) and<br>\
↓ قُصَيْرَاكَ, (M, K,) Thine utmost, or the utmost of<br>\
thy power or of thine ability or of thy deed,<br>\
(جُهْدُكَ, M, K, [or app., جَهْدُكَ, (see art. جهد,)]<br>\
and غَايَتُكَ, S, M, K,) and the end of thy case,<br>\
and that to which thou hast confined or restricted<br>\
or limited thyself, (S, TA,) [or that to which thou<br>\
art confined or restricted or limited,] is, or will<br>\
be, thy doing such a thing. (S, M, K.) It is<br>\
from قَصْرٌ signifying the “ act of confining, restricting, limiting,” &amp;c. (TA.) And ↓ قُصْرَى<br>\
also signifies the end of an affair. (Sgh, TA.)<br>\
A poet says<br>\
إِنَّمَا أَنْفُسُنَا عَارِيَّةٌ<br>\
وَالْعَوَارِىُّ قَصَارٌ أَنْ تُرَدْ<br>\
[Our souls are only a loan: and the end of loans<br>\
is their being given back; تُرَدْ being for تُرَدَّ]. (S,<br>\
TA.) You also say, كُلِّ بَلَآءٍ وَشِدَّةٍ ↓ المَوْتُ قُصَارِى<br>\
[Death is the end of every trial and distress].<br>\
(TA, art. حمأ.)<br>\

and ↓ مَقْصَرَةٌ and ↓ مَقْصِرٌ (M, K) The afternoon: or<br>\
evening: syn. عَشِىٌّ: (S, M, K:) or the first<br>\
signifies the last part of the day: (IKtt:) or the<br>\
time before the sun becomes yellow: (JK:) or<br>\
the first and second signify the time of the approach of the عَشِىّ, a little before the عَصْر: (A,<br>\
TA:) and the first (S, K) and second (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
TA) and third, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, TA,) [the time of]<br>\
the mixing of the darkness: (A&#39;Obeyd, S, K,<br>\
TA:) pl. of the second (TA) and third (S, M) and<br>\
fourth, (M,) مَقَاصِرُ (S, M) and مَقَاصِيرُ, which<br>\
latter is extr.; (M;) in the first sense, as signifying عَشَايَا; (M;) or in the last sense; (S;)<br>\
not signifying, as it is said to do in the K, العِشَآءُ<br>\
الآخِرَةُ; for this is a great mistake, app. occasioned by F&#39;s seeing the passage [in the T] of<br>\
Az, [or in the M, in which I find it,] وَالمَقَاصِرُ<br>\
وَالمَقَاصِيرُ العَشَايَا الأَخِيرَةُ نَادِرَةٌ, and not properly<br>\
considering it. (TA.) Sb says, that قَصْرٌ has no<br>\
dim.; the Arabs being content to use in its stead<br>\
the dim. of مَسَآءٌ. (M.) You say أَتَيْتُهُ قَصْرًا I<br>\
came to him in the afternoon, or evening; syn.<br>\
عَشِيًّا. (S.) And جِئْتُ قَصْرًا, and ↓ مَقْصَرًا, I<br>\

the عَصْر. (A, TA.) And العِشَآءِ ↓ أَقْبَلَتْ مَقَاصِيرُ<br>\
[The times of the mixing of the darkness of nightfall came, or advanced]. (A, TA.)<br>\
-A4-  قَصْرٌ [A<br>\
palace: a pavilion, or kind of building wholly or<br>\
for the most part isolated, sometimes on the top<br>\
of a larger building, i. e., a belvedere, and sometimes projecting from a larger building, and<br>\
generally consisting of one room if forming a part<br>\
of a larger building or connected with another<br>\
building; the same as the Turkish كوشك: to such<br>\
buildings we find the appellation to have been<br>\
applied from very early times to the present<br>\
day:] a well-known kind of edifice: (M:) a<br>\
mansion, or house; syn. مَنْزِلٌ: (Lh, M, K:) or<br>\
any house or chamber (بَيْت) of stone; (M, K;)<br>\
