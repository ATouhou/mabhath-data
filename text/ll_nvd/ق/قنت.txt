قُنُوتٌ is the inf. n. of قَنَتَ, (MA, Msb,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
قَنُتَ, (Msb,) and signifies The being obedient:<br>\
(S, M, MA, Mgh, K, TA:) or the being constantly obedient: (IAmb, O, TA:) the former is<br>\
the primary meaning: and hence, in the Kur<br>\
[xxxiii. 35], ↓ وَالْقَانِتَاتِ ↓ وَالْقَانِتِينَ [And the obedient<br>\
men and the obedient women]. (S, M, TA.)<br>\
One says, قَنَتَ لِلّٰهِ, (MA,) and قَنَتَ اللّٰهَ, (TA,)<br>\
[but this latter is unusual, the former only being<br>\
authorized by the Kur-án (in iii. 38 and xxxiii.<br>\
31),] meaning He was obedient to God. (MA,<br>\
TA.) And it is said in the Kur [ii. 110 and<br>\
xxx. 25], ↓ كُلٌّ لَهُ قَانِتُونَ i. e. All are obedient<br>\
unto Him: but the meaning here is, that the<br>\
beings in heaven [and earth] are created by the<br>\
will of God, and that none of them can alter the<br>\
form in which it is created; the obedience here<br>\
spoken of being obedience to the will [of God],<br>\
not the obedience of religious service; some of<br>\
them being obedient [in this sense], and others<br>\
being disobedient. (L, TA.) [It is said that]<br>\
the proper signification of ↓ القَانِتُ [or the signification that implies all the meanings of the word]<br>\
is The performer of the command of God. (L,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It signifies also The act of standing;<br>\
(Mgh, TA;) mentioned by Th, and asserted by<br>\
him to be the primary meaning. (TA.) And<br>\
(TA) The standing long. (IAmb, O, TA.) And<br>\
(TA) The standing in the performance of the<br>\
divinely-appointed act of prayer. (S, Msb, K,<br>\
TA.) [See also 4.] Hence, (Mgh, Msb, TA,)<br>\
it is said in a trad. (S, TA) of the Prophet, as a<br>\
reply given by him to the question أَىُّ الصَّلَاةِ<br>\
أَفْضَلُ, (TA,) أَفْضَلُ الصَّلَاةِ طُولُ القُنُوتِ (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA) i. e. [The most excellent characteristic<br>\
of the performance of the divinely-appointed act<br>\
of prayer is] the long continuance of the standing.<br>\
(Mgh, * Msb, * TA.) And hence, قُنُوتُ الوِتْرِ;<br>\
(S; [see art. وتر;]) or [as it is also termed] دُعَآءُ<br>\
القُنُوتِ, which means The supplication of the<br>\
standing; (Msb;) for one utters the supplication<br>\
standing: (TA:) and what is thus termed (دُعَآءُ<br>\
القُنُوتِ) is as follows: اَللَّهُمَّ إِنَّا نَسْتَعِينُكَ وَنَسْتَغْفِرُكَ<br>\
وَنُؤْمِنُ بِكَ وَنَتَوَكَّلُ عَلَيْكَ وَنُثْنِى عَلَيْكَ الخَيْرَ وَلَا<br>\
نَكْفُرُكَ وَنَخْلَعُ وَنَتْرُكُ مَنْ يَفْجُرُكَ اَللّٰهُمَّ إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ<br>\
وَلَكَ نُصَلِّى وَنَسْجُدُ وَإِلَيْكَ نَسْعَى وَنَحْفِدُ نَرْجُو رَحْمَتَكَ<br>\
وَنَخْشَى عَذَابَكَ إِنَّ عَذَابَكَ بِالكُفَّارِ مُلْحِقٌ i. e. O God,<br>\
verily we beg of Thee aid to be obedient and to<br>\
forsake disobedience, and we beg of Thee forgiveness of sins, [and we believe in Thee, and we rely<br>\
upon Thee,] and we laud Thee well, and we will<br>\
not be unthankful to Thee for Thy favour, and<br>\
we cast off and forsake him who disobeys Thee:<br>\
[O God, Thee we worship, and to Thee we perform the divinely-appointed act of prayer, and<br>\
prostrate ourselves;] and we are quick in working<br>\
for Thee and in serving Thee: we hope for Thy<br>\
mercy, and we dread Thy punishment: verily Thy<br>\
punishment overtakes the unbelievers; thus this<br>\
clause is expl. on the authority of Ks: or, as some<br>\
say, it means, causes others to overtake, or become<br>\
associated with, the unbelievers. (Mgh. [See also<br>\
art. لحق.]) It is said of the Prophet, قَنَتَ شَهْرًا<br>\
فِى صَلَاةِ الصُّبْحِ بَعْدَ الرُّكُوعِ يَدْعُو عَلَى رِعْلٍ وَذَكُوَانَ<br>\
[He stood during a month, in the prayer of daybreak, after (the prayers of) the رُكُوع (pl. of<br>\
رَكَعَ, q. v.), cursing (the tribes of) Rial and<br>\
Dhekwán]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The act of supplicating [God]: (Zj, Mgh, O, Msb, K, TA:)<br>\
this is the signification [most] commonly known.<br>\
(Zj, Mgh, O, TA.) And [particularly, accord.<br>\
to general usage,] The supplicating God [by addressing Him with the form of words mentioned<br>\
above as used in what is termed دُعَآءُ القُنُوتِ], doing<br>\
so standing. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And The divinely-appointed act of prayer; syn. صَلَاةٌ. (IAmb, O,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And The being silent; (O, Msb, K,<br>\
TA;) by which is meant (O, * TA) the withholding oneself from talking; (O, * K, TA;) in,<br>\
or during, [the prayer called] الصَّلَاة. (O, * Msb,<br>\
TA.) Hence, (O, Msb, TA,) accord. to a trad.,<br>\
(O, TA,) the saying in the Kur [ii. 239], وَقُومُوا<br>\
↓ لِلّٰهِ قَانِتِينَ [And stand ye unto God, in the<br>\
divinely-appointed act of prayer, refraining from<br>\
talking]. (O, Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And The serving of<br>\
God. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And The continuing of the performance of the pilgrimage. (TA.) One says,<br>\
[قَنَتَ and] ↓ اقنت, meaning He continued the<br>\
performance of the pilgrimage. (IAar, O, K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And The prolonging of engaging in<br>\
warring, or warring and plundering. (TA.)<br>\
One says, [قَنَتَ and] ↓ اقنت, meaning He prolonged the engaging in warring, or warring and<br>\
plundering. (IAar, O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And The confessing, or acknowledging, one&#39;s being in the condition of a servant [to God]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  And<br>\
The being lowly, humble, or submissive: (A, TA:)<br>\
or the keeping to obedience [to God], with lowliness, humility, or submissiveness. (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA.) One says, قَنَتَ لَهُ He was, or became,<br>\
lowly, humble, or submissive, to him. (TA.) And<br>\
قَنَتَتِ المراة لِزَوْجِهَا, (A,) or لِبَعْلِهَا, (TA,) The<br>\
woman was, or became, lowly, humble, or submissive, and obedient, to her husband: (A:) or was,<br>\
or became, quiet and submissive; syn. أَقَرَّت.<br>\
(TA.) [See also 4, and 8.]<br>\
-A2-  قَنَاتَةٌ [is an inf. n.,<br>\
of which the verb is قَنُتَ, like قَتُنَ, and] signifies<br>\
The eating little [like قَتَانَةٌ]. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
اقنت He stood long in the performance of<br>\
the divinely-appointed act of prayer. (O, K.)<br>\
[And قَنَتَ has the same, or nearly the same,<br>\
meaning; as is shown above.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, [like<br>\
قَنَتَ عَلَى عَدُوِّهِ,] He cursed his enemy. (IAar,<br>\
O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 1, last quarter, in two places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  Also He lowered, humbled, or submitted, himself to God. (IAar, O, K.)<br>\
8<br>\
اقتنت He was, or became, tractable, or submissive. (TA.) [And اكتنت has a similar<br>\
meaning.]<br>\
قَنُوتٌ A woman lowly, humble, or submissive,<br>\
and obedient [to her husband]. (A.)<br>\
قَنِيتٌ A woman who eats little: (O, K:) as<br>\
also قَتِينٌ. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  سِقَآءٌ قَنِيتٌ i. q. مِسِّيكٌ, so in<br>\
a copy of the K, meaning [A skin] that retains<br>\
the water; and this is the right explanation:<br>\
(TA:) but accord. to AZ and Z, the word مسيك<br>\
thus used is like أَمِيرٌ; and سِقَآءٌ مَسِيكٌ is expl. by<br>\
Z as meaning [a skin] that does not exude, and by<br>\
AZ as meaning [a skin] that retains the water so<br>\
that it does not exude: (TA in art. مسك:) in the<br>\
present art., in some of the copies of the K, مُسِيلٌ,<br>\
the act. part. n. from أَسَالَ المَآءَ; and thus in a<br>\
copy of the Tekmileh. (TA in the present art.:<br>\
in the O, in this art., it is مَسِيلٌ.)<br>\
قَانِتٌ [part. n. of قَنَتَ in all its senses]: see three<br>\
exs. in the first quarter of the first paragraph,<br>\
and another ex. in the last quarter; its [broken]<br>\
pl., in all its senses is قَنَّتٌ. (ISd, TA.)<br>\
