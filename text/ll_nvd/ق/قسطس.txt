for weighing: (S, Msb, K; and Bd in xvii. 37:)<br>\
or the most even and most just kind thereof: or<br>\
such as is just, of whatever kind it be: (K:) or<br>\
i. q. قَبَّانٌ [a steelyard]: or, as Lth thinks, the<br>\
iron of the قبّان: or i. q. شَاهِينٌ [the beam of a<br>\
balance]: (TA:) or i. q. فَرَسْطُونٌ [an arabicized<br>\
Persian word, signifying a public standard of<br>\
weights or measures]: (Zj, TA:) also written<br>\
قصطاس: (K:) said to be Arabic, from القِسْطُ,<br>\
meaning “ justice: ” (Msb:) or a Greek word<br>\
arabicized; (IDrd, Msb, K;) and its being so<br>\
does not impugn the truth of the Kur-án&#39;s being<br>\
[altogether] Arabic; for when a foreign word is<br>\
used by the Arabs, and made by them conformable with their language in respect of<br>\
desinential syntax and determinateness and indeterminateness and the like, it becomes Arabic:<br>\
