pasture the camels ill, they will not drink; (S,<br>\
O, K;) for they drink only when they are<br>\

قُصْبٌ A gut; syn. مِعًى: (S, M, Mgh, O,<br>\
K:) or all the أَمْعَآء [or guts]: or the guts<br>\
[امعآء] that are in the lower part of the belly:<br>\
TA:) pl. أَقْصَابٌ. (S. M, Mgh, O, K.) One<br>\
says, هُوَ يَجُرُّ قُصْبَهُ [expl. by what here follows].<br>\
(S, O.) The Prophet said, respecting &#39;Amr Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Ámir El-Khurá&#39;ee, who first set at liberty<br>\
سَوَائِب [pl. of سَائِبَةٌ, q. v.], (O,) or respecting<br>\
&#39;Amr Ibn-Kamee-ah, who first changed the<br>\
religion of Ishmael, (TA,) رَأَيْتُهُ يَجُرُّ قُصْبَهُ فِى النُّارِ<br>\
[I saw him dragging his guts in the fire of Hell].<br>\
(O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  El-Aashà in his saying<br>\
وَشَاهِدُنَا الجُلَّ وَاليَاسَمِى<br>\
نُ وَالمُسْمِعَاتُ بِأَقْصَابِهَا<br>\
means [The rose being present with us, and the<br>\
jasmine, and the songstresses] with their chords of<br>\
gut: or, as some relate it, (and as it is cited in<br>\
the M,) he said ↓ بِقُصَّابِهَا, meaning with their<br>\
musical reeds, or pipes. (S, O.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (tropical:)  The<br>\
middle of the body; metaphorically applied thereto: so in the saying of Imra-el-Keys, (S, O, L,)<br>\
or, accord. to the people of El-Koofeh and ElBasrah, it is falsely ascribed to him, (O,)<br>\
والقُصْبُ مُضْطَمِرٌ وَالمَتْنُ مَلْحُوبُ<br>\
[And the middle of the body slender and lean,<br>\
and the portion next the back-bone, on either side,<br>\
smooth, and sloping downwards]. (S, O, L.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And (assumed tropical:)  The back. (O, K. [SM, not having<br>\
found this in any lexicon but the K, supposed<br>\
that الظَّهْرُ might be substituted in it for الخَصْرُ,<br>\
which is not therein mentioned as a meaning of<br>\
القُصْبُ.])<br>\
قَصَبٌ [a coll. gen. n., signifying Reeds, or<br>\
canes; and the like, as the culms of corn, &amp;c.;<br>\
and sometimes signifying a reed, or cane, and the<br>\
like, as meaning a species thereof;] any plant<br>\
having (M, A, Mgh, Msb, K) its stem composed<br>\
of (Mgh, Msb) أَنَابِيب [or internodial portions]<br>\
(M, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and [their] كُعُوب [or<br>\
connecting knots, or joints]; (Mgh, Msb;) [i. e.<br>\
any kind, or species, of plant having a jointed<br>\
stem;] i. q. أَبَآءٌ [a word comparatively little<br>\
known]; (S; [in the O اَناء, a mistranscription;])<br>\
and [it is said that] ↓ قَصْبَآءُ signifies the same:<br>\
(S, O: [but see what follows:]) the n. un. of<br>\
the former is ↓ قَصَبَةٌ (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K) and<br>\
↓ قَصْبَاةٌ or ↓ قَصَبَاةٌ: (K accord. to different copies;<br>\
the former accord. to the TA: [but each of these<br>\
I believe to be a mistake for ↓ قَصُبْآءَةٌ, which is<br>\
said to be a n. un. of قَصْبَآءُ, and therefore held by<br>\
some to be syn. with قَصَبَةٌ:]) ↓ قَصْبَآءُ [appears,<br>\
however, to differ somewhat from قَصَب, for it is<br>\
said that it] signifies an assemblage of قَصَب;<br>\
(M, K;) and its n. un. is ↓ قَصَبَةٌ and ↓ قَصْبَآءَةٌ<br>\
[like حَلَفَةٌ and حَلْفَآءَةٌ which are both said to be<br>\
ns. un. of حَلْفَآءٌ; and طَرَفَةٌ and طَرْفَآءَةٌ, said to be<br>\
ns. un. of طَرْفَآءٌ; the former in each case anomalous]: (M: [see also Ham p. 201:]) or, accord.<br>\
to Sb, ↓ قَصْبَآءُ is sing. and pl., (S, M, Mgh, O,)<br>\
and so طَرْفَآءُ, (S, M, O,) and حَلْفَآءُ; (S, O;) as<br>\
pl. and as sing. also having the sign of the fem.<br>\
gender; therefore, when they mean to express<br>\
the sing. signification, they add the epithet<br>\
وَاحِدَةٌ; thus, and thus only, distinguishing the<br>\
sing. meaning from the pl., and making a<br>\
difference between a word of this class and a<br>\
noun that denotes a pl. meaning and has not the<br>\
sign of the fem. gender such as تَمْرٌ and بُسْرٌ, and<br>\
such as أَرْطًى and عَلْقًى of which the ns. un. are<br>\
أَرْطَاةٌ and عَلْقَاةٌ: (M:) or, as some say, ↓ قَصْبَآءُ<br>\
signifies many قَصَب growing in a place: (Mgh:)<br>\
and it signifies also a place in which قَصَب grow:<br>\
(M, K:) [or] ↓ مَقْصَبَةٌ has this last meaning;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb;) or signifies, like ↓ أَرْضٌ قَصِبَةٌ, a<br>\
land having قَصَب. (M, K. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَحْرَزَ قَصَبَ<br>\
السَّبْقِ, (Msb,) or السَّبْقِ ↓ قَصَبَةَ, (TA,) [meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He won, or acquired, the canes, or cane, of<br>\
victory in racing,] is said of the winner in horseracing: they used to set up, in the horse-course,<br>\
a cane (قَصَبَة,) and he who outstripped plucked<br>\
it up and took it, in order that he might be<br>\
known to be the one who outstripped, without<br>\
contention: this was the origin of the phrase:<br>\
then, in consequence of frequency of usage, it<br>\
was applied also to the expeditious, quick, and<br>\
light, or active: (Msb, * TA:) [accord. to the<br>\
TA, it is a tropical phrase, but perhaps it is so<br>\
only when used in the latter way:] it is said in a<br>\
trad. of Sa&#39;eed Ibn-El-Ás, that he measured the<br>\
horse-course with the cane, making it to be a<br>\
hundred canes in length, and the cane was stuck<br>\
upright in the ground at the goal, and he who<br>\
was first in arriving at it took it, and was entitled to the stake. (O, TA. [See also مُقَصِّبٌ.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [The ↓ قَصَبَة here mentioned as A certain<br>\
measure of length, used in measuring race-courses,<br>\
was also used in other cases, in measuring land,<br>\
and differed in different countries and in different<br>\
times: accord. to some, it was ten cubits; thus<br>\
nearly agreeing with our “ rod: ” (see جَرِيبٌ:)<br>\
accord. to others, six cubits and a third of a<br>\
cubit: (see فَدَّانٌ:) the modern Egyptian قَصَبَة,<br>\
until it was reduced some years ago, was about<br>\
twelve English feet and a half; its twentyfourth part, called قَبْضَةٌ, being the measure of a<br>\
man&#39;s fist with the thumb erect, or about six<br>\
inches and a quarter.] ―<br>\
-b4-  القَصَبُ الفَارِسِىُّ [The<br>\
Persian reed] is a kind whereof writing-reeds are<br>\
made: (Mgh, Msb:) and another kind thereof is<br>\
hard and thick; and of this kind are made<br>\
musical reeds, or pipes; and with it houses, or<br>\
chambers, are roofed. (Msb) One says, قَصَبُ<br>\
الخطِّ أَنْفَذُ مِنْ قَصَبِ الخَطِّ [meaning Writingreeds are more penetrating, or effective, than the<br>\
canes of El-Khatt (which are spears); i. e.,<br>\
words wound more than spears]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
قَصَبُ السُّكَّرِ is well-known [as meaning The<br>\
sugar-cane]: (Msb:) this is of three kinds;<br>\
white and yellow and black: of the first and<br>\
second, but not of the third, the juice [of which<br>\
sugar is made] is expressed; and this expressed<br>\
juice is called عَسَلُ القَصَبِ. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b6-  قَصَبُ<br>\
الذَّرِيرَةِ [is Calamus aromaticus; also called قَصَبُ<br>\
الطِّيبِ]: a species thereof has the joints near together, and breaks into many fragments, or<br>\
splinters, and the internodial portions thereof are<br>\
filled with a substance like spiders&#39; webs: when<br>\
chewed, it has an acrid taste, and it is aromatic<br>\
(Mgh, Msb) when brayed, or powdered; (Mgh;)<br>\
and inclines to yellowness and whiteness. (Mgh,<br>\
Msb. [See also ذَرِيرَةٌ, in art. ذر.]) ―<br>\
-b7-  قَصَبٌ also<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  Any round and hollow bone [or rather<br>\
bones]; (S, O;) it is pl. [or rather a coll. gen. n.]<br>\
of which ↓ قَصَبَةٌ is the sing. [or n. un,], this latter<br>\
signifying any bone containing marrow; (M,<br>\
K;) thus called by way of comparison [to the<br>\
reed, or cane]. (M.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And (tropical:)  The bones of the<br>\
يَدَانِ and رِجْلَانِ [i. e. arms and legs, or hands<br>\
and feet, but here app. meaning the latter], (A,<br>\

TA;) (tropical:)  the bones whereof there are three in each<br>\
finger and two in the thumb [and the like in the<br>\

أَصَابِع [or fingers and toes] which are also called<br>\
سُلَامَى: (Msb in art. سلم:) or, as some say, the<br>\
portions between every two joints of the أَصَابِع:<br>\
(M, TA:) and الأَصَابِعِ ↓ قَصَبَةُ [or قَصَبُةُ الإِصْبَعِ]<br>\
signifies the أَنْمَلَة [here perhaps meaning the<br>\
ungual phalanx] of the finger or toe. (Msb,<br>\

صَنَمَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b11-  And (tropical:)  [The bronchi;] the branches of the<br>\

Msb,) signifies the ducts (عُرُوق) of the lungs; (S,<br>\

(IAar, O, K) i. e. [Rejoice thou Khadeejeh by<br>\
the announcement of] a pavilion [in Paradise]<br>\
of brilliant pearls, &amp;c.: (IAar, O:) or the meaning is, of hollow pearls [or pearl], spacious, like<br>\
the lofty palace: (IAth, TA:) or of emerald:<br>\
(TA voce بَيْتٌ:) and it is said by some to convey<br>\
an allusion to Khadeejeh&#39;s acquiring what is<br>\
termed قَصَبُ السَّبْقِ [expl. above], because she<br>\
was the first person, or the first of women, who<br>\
embraced El-Islám. (MF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b14-  And (tropical:)  Fine,<br>\

قَصَب [meaning the cylindrical, or oblong, hollow<br>\

in other copies of the K, (in the place of which I<br>\
find لُهْج in a copy of the M, app. a mistranscription,) I read, and thus render لَجَف, supposing it to mean such a place in the side of a rivulet<br>\
