قَطْرَبَ, (K,) inf. n. قَطْرَبَةٌ, (O,) He<br>\
hastened, sped, or went quickly. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  And<br>\
قَطْرَبَهُ He threw him down, or prostrated him, on<br>\
the ground: (O, K: *) and so قَرْطَبَهُ. (O.)<br>\
Q. 2<br>\
تَقَطْرَبَ He (a man, TA) moved about his<br>\
head: and made himself to resemble the قُطْرُب:<br>\
(K:) or became like the قُطْرُب in some one of the<br>\
senses assigned to it in what follows. (TA.)<br>\
قُطْرُبٌ A certain bird; (S, O, K;) [app. a<br>\
species of owl; accord. to Dmr, as cited by Freytag, a bird that roves about by night and does not<br>\
sleep; and hence rendered by him, and by Golius,<br>\
strix. No other meaning of the word, as an<br>\
appellative, is mentioned in the S.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And A<br>\
certain insect that rests not all the day, going<br>\
about, or going about quickly, (O, K, TA,) or, as<br>\
they used to assert in the Time of Ignorance,<br>\
that never rests, (TA,) moving about on the surface<br>\
of water. (KL.) Mohammad Ibn-El-Mustaneer,<br>\
(K, TA,) the grammarian, (TA,) was surnamed<br>\
قُطْرُب because he used to go early in the morning<br>\
to Seebaweyh; so that the latter, whenever he<br>\
opened his door, found him there; wherefore he<br>\
said to him, مَا أَنْتَ إِلَّا قُطْرُبُ لَيْلٍ [Thou art none<br>\
other than a kutrub of night]. (K, * TA.) It is<br>\
also expl. in the K as meaning Light, or active;<br>\
and Th mentions that it signifies thus; and adds<br>\
that one says, إِنَّهُ لَقُطْرُبُ لَيْلٍ [Verily he is a<br>\
kutrub of night]; but this shows that it means an<br>\
insect [described above], and is not [properly<br>\
speaking] an epithet. (TA.) To this insect is<br>\
likened a man who labours during the day in<br>\
accomplishing worldly wants and in the evening<br>\
is fatigued so that he sleeps during the night<br>\
until he enters upon the time of morning to betake<br>\
himself to the like thereof, هٰذَا جِيفَةُ لَيْلِ قُطْرُبُ<br>\
نَهَارٍ [lit. This is a corpse of the night, a kutrub of<br>\
the day]. (O, from an explanation of a trad.)<br>\
[See also Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov. i. 329 and 643.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence, app.,] (assumed tropical:)  A thief who is skilful, or<br>\
active, in thievishness: (O, M, TA:) for اللِّصُّ<br>\
الفَارِهُ فِى اللُّصُوصِيَّةِ, an explanation of القُطْرُبُ<br>\
given [in the O and] by IM and others, the<br>\
copies of the K erroneously substitute اللِّصُ وَالفَأْرَةُ<br>\
[as though قُطْرُبٌ had the significations of a thief<br>\
and a rat or mouse]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And The male<br>\
(Lth, O, K, TA) of the [kind of demon called]<br>\
سِعْلَاة (Lth, TA) or of the غُول [which is said to<br>\
signify the same as سعلاة]; as also ↓ قُطْرُوبٌ. (O,<br>\
K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And [app. A young, or little, jinnee:<br>\
thus قُرْطُبٌ is expl. in the L: or] the young ones,<br>\
or little ones, of the jinn. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And A young,<br>\
or little, dog: (O:) or the young ones, or little<br>\
ones, of dogs. (K.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And A wolf such as is<br>\
termed أَمْعَط [i. e. whose hair has fallen off, part<br>\
after part, or has become scanty; or mischievous,<br>\
or malignant]. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b8-  And An ignorant<br>\
person, (O, K, TA,) who boasts by reason of his<br>\
ignorance (يَظْهَرُ بِجَهْلِهِ). (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  And<br>\
Cowardly, or a coward, (O, K, TA,) even if<br>\
intelligent. (O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b10-  And Lightwitted; syn.<br>\
سَفِيهٌ; (O, K, TA;) as also ↓ قُطْرُوبٌ: and IAar<br>\
has mentioned as a pl. in this sense, used by a<br>\
poet, قَطَارِيبُ, which, ISd says, may be pl. of<br>\
قُطْرُوبٌ or of a sing. of some other form requiring<br>\
such a form of pl., or it may be used as a pl. of<br>\
قُطْرُبٌ by poetic license. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  And Thrown<br>\
down, or prostrated, on the ground, syn. مَصْرُوعٌ,<br>\
(O, K, TA,) by reason of diabolical possession or<br>\
wrestling. (O, * TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A species of<br>\
melancholia; (O, K, TA;) a well-known disease,<br>\
arising from the black bile; (TA;) mostly originating in the month of شُبَاط [February, O. S.];<br>\
vitiating, or disordering, the intellect, contracting<br>\
the face, occasioning continual unhappiness, causing<br>\
to wander about in the night, and rendering the<br>\
face أَخْضَر [here app. meaning of a dark, or an<br>\
ashy, dust-colour], the eyes sunken, and the body<br>\
emaciated. (O.) [A more ample discription is<br>\
given by Avicenna (Ibn-Seenà). in book iii.<br>\
pp. 315, et seq. SM states that he had not found<br>\
this in any other lexicon than the K. Golius explains the word as signifying Lycanthropia, on<br>\
the authority of Rhazes (Er-Rázee).]<br>\
