of subsistence, (TA,) him, (Msb, TA,) or them,<br>\
(K, TA,) or his family; (S, O;) he gave him [or<br>\
them] what is termed قُوت [q. v.]: (Msb:) and<br>\
↓ اقاتهُ signifies [in like manner] he gave him his<br>\

إِثْمًا أَنْ يُضَيِّعَ مَنْ يَقُوتُ i. e. [It suffices the man<br>\
as a sin, or crime, that he destroy] him whom he<br>\
is bound to sustain, of his family and household<br>\
and slaves: or, as some relate it, ↓ مَنْ يُقِيتُهُ;<br>\
using a dial. var. [of يقوت]. (TA.) [And<br>\
لَهُ ↓ اقتات app. signifies, primarily, He supplied to<br>\
him food. (See this verb below, near the end of<br>\
the paragraph.)]<br>\
-A2-  And قَاتَ and ↓ قوّت and<br>\

straitened his household, by reason of niggardliness<br>\
or poverty. (TA in art. زنق.)<br>\

others ↓ قُوِّتُوا, [loosely expl. in the TA,] means,<br>\

will bless you in it: or, accord. to others, make ye<br>\

فُلَانٌ يَتَقَوَّتُ بِكَذَا [Such a one feeds, nourishes,<br>\
or sustains, himself with such a thing], (S, O,) or<br>\
بِالقَلِيلِ [with that which is little]: (Msb:) or<br>\
تقّوت بِالشَّىْءِ he made the thing his قُوت [or food];<br>\
and بِهِ ↓ اقتات and ↓ اقتاتهُ signify thus likewise:<br>\

One says, هُمْ يَقْتَاتُونَ الحَبَّ [They feed upon, or<br>\
eat, grain]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  The saying, of Tufeyl,<br>\
يَقْتَاتُ فَضْلَ سَنَامِهَا الرَّحْلُ<br>\
is held by ISd to mean, (assumed tropical:)  The saddle [as it were]<br>\
eats the remainder of her hump, [as though]<br>\
making it to be food for itself: accord. to IAar,<br>\
he says, the meaning is, takes it away thing after<br>\
thing [or piecemeal]; but I have not heard this<br>\
[meaning] in any other instance: hence, says<br>\
IAar, the oath sworn one day by El-&#39;Okeylee,<br>\
[said in the A to be an oath of the Arabs of the<br>\
desert,] نَفْسِى البَصِيرِ مَا فَعَلْتُ ↓ لَا وَقَائِتِ, for, he<br>\
says, الاِقْتِيَاتُ [the inf. n. of اقتات] and القَوْتُ<br>\
[inf. n. of ↓ قَاتَ] are one [in signification]; and<br>\
AM says that the meaning of this is, [No, by]<br>\
Him who takes my spirit, breath after breath,<br>\
until He has taken it wholly, [the All-seeing, I<br>\
did not that thing:] and the saying of Tufeyl<br>\
means the saddle, while I am riding upon it,<br>\
takes by little and little the fat of her hump until<br>\
there remains not of it aught. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  One<br>\
says also, الحَرْبُ تَقْتَاتُ الإِبِلَ (tropical:)  [War makes the<br>\
camels to be food]; meaning that [in consequence<br>\
of war] the camels are given in payment of<br>\
bloodwits. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And فُلَانٌ يَقْتَاتُ الكَلَامَ (tropical:)  Such<br>\
a one retrenches, or curtails, speech, or talk; [said<br>\
of one who speaks, or talks, little;] syn. يُقِلُّهُ.<br>\

says, ↓ اِقْتَتْ لِنَارِكَ قِيتَةً (assumed tropical:)  [Supply to thy fire ali-<br>\
ment;] feed thy fire with fuel. (S, O, K.) And<br>\
↓ اِقْتَتْ لِلنَّارِ نَفْخَكَ قِيتَةً, and اُنْفُخْ فِى النَّارِ نَفْخًا<br>\
↓ قُوتًا, (assumed tropical:)  Blow thou the fire with thy blowing, and<br>\
with a blowing, gently and little [as an aliment].<br>\

or victuals]. (S, A, O, K.)<br>\
[<br>\
قَاتٌ A species of tree, of the class Pentandria,<br>\
order Monogynia, of the Linnæan system; belonging to the natural order of Celastraceæ;<br>\
mentioned in botanical works under the name of<br>\
Catha edulis; and fully described by Forskål in<br>\
his Flora Ægypt. Arab., pp. 63, 64; in the latter<br>\
page of which he says: “ In Yemen colitur<br>\
iisdem hortis cum Coffea. Stipitibus plantatur.<br>\
Arabes folia viridia avide edunt, multum eorum<br>\
vires venditantes, qui copiosius comederit, vel<br>\
totam vigilet noctem: asseverant quoque pestem<br>\
ea loca non intrare ubi hæc colitur arbor: ” &amp;c.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And in the same work, p. cxviii., Forskål<br>\
mentions قات الرعيان (by which is meant قَاتُ<br>\
الرُّعْيَانِ) as the name of A species of lettuce, lactuca<br>\
inermis. ―<br>\
-b3-  Respecting the former plant, see also<br>\
De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed., i. 462, 463.]<br>\
قُوت Food, aliment, nutriment, victuals, or<br>\
provisions, by means of which the body of man is<br>\
sustained; (S, A, * O, K; *) as also ↓ قِيتٌ and<br>\
↓ قِيتَةٌ, (S, O, K,) as used in phrases here following, (S, O,) with kesr to the ق, and the و changed<br>\
into ى, (S,) and ↓ قَائِتٌ and ↓ قُوَاتٌ, (K,) the last<br>\
mentioned, but not expl., by Lh, and thought by<br>\
ISd to be from قُوتٌ: (TA:) what is eaten for<br>\
the purpose of retaining the remains of life; (A, *<br>\
O, * Msb, TA; *) thus expl. by Az and IF:<br>\
(Msb:) or food sufficient to sustain life: (TA:)<br>\
pl. أَقْوَاتٌ. (Msb, TA.) One says, مَا عِنْدَهُ قُوتُ<br>\
لَيْلَةٍ and لَيْلَةٍ ↓ قِيتُ and لَيْلَةٍ ↓ قِيتَةُ (S, O, TA)<br>\
He has not a night&#39;s food sufficient to sustain life.<br>\
(TA.) And ↓ جَدُّ امْرِئٍ فِى قَائِتِهِ, a prov., meaning A man&#39;s lot in life is manifest in his food.<br>\

-b2-<br>\
And hence, Sufficing]. القَائِتُ مِنَ العَيْشِ means<br>\
What is sufficient [of the means of subsistence].<br>\
(K.) And one says, هُوَ فِى قَائِتٍ مِنَ العَيْشِ He<br>\

of subsistence]. (S. O.) ―<br>\

مُقِيتٌ [Giving, or a giver of, food, nourishment,<br>\
or sustenance. (See 1, first sentence.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
hence,] Keeping, preserving, guarding, or protecting; or a keeper, &amp;c.; syn. حَافِظٌ [as signifying thus; and app. as signifying also watching;<br>\
or a watcher]: (S, A, O, Msb, K:) and witnessing; or a witness; syn. شَاهِدٌ; (S, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
or شَهِيدٌ: (A:) and AO says that it signifies,<br>\
with the Arabs, one acquainted (مَوْقُوفٌ) with a<br>\
thing (عَلَى شَىْءٍ). (TA.) Th cites the following<br>\
verses (of Es-Semow&#39;al Ibn-Ádiyà, O):<br>\
لَيْتَ شِعْرِى وَأَشْعُرَنَّ إِذَا مَا<br>\
قَرَّبُوهَا مَنْشُورَةً وَدُعِيتُ<br>\
أَلِىَ الفَضْلُ أَمْ عَلَىَّ إِذَا حُو<br>\
سِبْتُ إِنِّى عَلَى الحِسَابِ مُقِيتُ<br>\
[meaning Would that I knew, but I shall assuredly<br>\
know when they shall have set it (namely, the<br>\
صَحِيفَة, or record, of my actions,) near, unfolded,<br>\
and I am summoned, whether superiority be for<br>\
me or against me when I am reckoned with:<br>\
verily I shall be a watcher, or a witness, of the<br>\
reckoning, or, accord. to some, as is said in the<br>\
TA, acquainted with the reckoning]: i. e. I shall<br>\
know what evil I have done; for [as is said in<br>\
the Kur lxxv. 14] man shall be a witness against<br>\
himself: (S, O, TA:) IB says that, accord. to<br>\
Seer, the correct reading is, رَبِّى على الحساب مقيت<br>\
[meaning my Lord is able to make the reckoning]<br>\
because he who is submissive to his Lord does<br>\
not describe himself by this epithet: but IB adds<br>\
that Seer has founded this remark upon the assumption that مقيت is here used as meaning<br>\
مُقْتَدِرٌ; and that if it be understood as syn. with<br>\
حَافِظٌ and شَاهِدٌ, the former reading is not objectionable. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  المُقِيتُ is one of the best<br>\
names of God: (TA:) and [as such] signifies<br>\
The Possessor of power; (Fr, Zj, S, O, Msb, K,<br>\
TA;) as He who gives to every man his قُوت [or<br>\
food], (F, S, O, K, TA,) and likewise to everything: (TA:) or (as one of those names, TA)<br>\
the Preserver, or Protector, (Zj, TA,) who gives<br>\
to everything such preservation, or protection, as<br>\
is needful. (TA.) It is said in the Kur [iv. 87],<br>\
وَكَانَ اللّٰهُ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ مُقِيتًا, (S, O,) meaning<br>\
[For God is] a possessor of power [over everything,<br>\
or is omnipotent], (Ksh, Bd, Jel,) so He will requite everyone for what he has done: (Jel:) or<br>\
a witness, [and] a preserver, or protector, or<br>\
watcher. (Ksh, Bd.)<br>\
