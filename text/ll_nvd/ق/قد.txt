denotes repetition of the action, or its relation to<br>\
several objects,] inf. n. تَقْدِيدٌ; (L, K;) and<br>\
↓ اقتدّهُ, (M, L,) inf. n. اِقْتِدَادٌ; (K;) He cut it<br>\
in an enlongated form; or lengthwise: (IDrd, M,<br>\
L, K:) or slit, split, clave, rent, or divided, it,<br>\
(namely, a thong, &amp;c., S, O, L, and a garment,<br>\
or piece of cloth, L,) lengthwise: (S, M, A, O,<br>\
L, Msb, K:) and he cut it off entirely: (M, L,<br>\
K:) or he cut it, or cut it off, in an absolute<br>\
sense: (TA:) he cut it, namely, a skin: and he<br>\
rent it, namely, a garment, or piece of cloth, or<br>\
the like. (L.) One says, ضَرَبَهُ بِالسَّيْفِ فَقَدَّهُ<br>\
بِنِصْفَيْنِ [He smote him with the sword and clave<br>\
him in halves,] (L, Msb, *) or قَدَّهُ نِصْفَيْنِ. (A.)<br>\
And قَدَّ القَلَمَ وَقَطَّهُ [He slit the writing-reed, and<br>\
nibbed it, or cut off its point breadthwise, or<br>\
crosswise]: (A, TA:) [for] قَطَّهُ is opposed to<br>\
قَدَّهُ: (S and TA in art. قط:) and both of these<br>\
verbs occur in a trad. describing &#39;Alee&#39;s different<br>\
modes of cutting [with the sword] when contracting himself and when stretching himself up.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] قَدَّ, (S, M, A, L,) inf. n.<br>\
قَدٌّ, (M, L, K,) (tropical:)  He clave, cut through by<br>\
journeying, or passed through, the desert, (S, M,<br>\
A, O, L, K,) and the night. (M, L) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
قَدَّ بِهِ الطَّرِيقُ, (so in a copy of the M,) or قَدَّتْهُ<br>\
الطَّرِيقُ, (so in the L and TA,) aor. and inf. n.<br>\
as above, (M, L, TA,) i. q. قَطَعَهُ (M) or قَطَعَتْهُ<br>\
(L, TA) (tropical:)  [The road cut him off, app. from his<br>\
companions, or from the object of his journey:<br>\
compare قَطَعَ بِهِ and قُطِعَ بِهِ]. ―<br>\
-b4-  And قَدَّ الكَلَامَ,<br>\
(M, L,) inf. n. as above, (M, L, K,) i. q. قَطَعَهُ<br>\
(M, L, K *) and شَقَّهُ (M, L) [both of which explanations may here mean, as قَطَعَ الكَلَامَ<br>\
generally does, (assumed tropical:)  He cut short, or broke off, the<br>\
speech; or ceased from speaking: or both may<br>\
here mean, as قَطَعَ الكَلَامَ sometimes does, he<br>\
articulated speech, or the speech: compare this<br>\
latter rendering with an explanation of شَقَّقَ<br>\
الكَلَامَ]. ―<br>\
-b5-  [قَدَّهُ also signifies He cut it out, or<br>\
shaped it, in any manner, whether lengthwise or<br>\
otherwise; like قَتَّهُ: see this latter, and a verse<br>\
cited as an ex. of its inf. n.: and see also a<br>\
saying near the end of the first paragraph of art.<br>\
فرى. Hence] قُدَّ فُلَانٌ قَدَّ السَّيْفِ [Such a one<br>\
was shaped with the shaping of the sword] means<br>\
(tropical:)  such a one was made goodly, or beautiful, in<br>\
respect of التَّقْطِيع [i. e. conformation, or proportion, &amp;c., like as is the sword]. (S, O, L,<br>\
TA.) [See also قَدٌّ, below.] ―<br>\
-b6-  And قُدّ means<br>\
also (assumed tropical:)  He suffered a pain [app. what may be<br>\
termed a cutting pain] in the belly, called قُدَاد.<br>\
(M, L, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
قَدَّ3َ see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] قدّد, (as<br>\
implied in the L,) or قدّد اللَّحْمَ, (A, O, *) inf. n.<br>\
تَقْدِيدٌ, (O, L,) He made قَدِيد [i. e. he cut flesh-meat into strips, or oblong pieces, and spread<br>\
them in the sun, or salted them and spread them<br>\
in the sun, to dry]. (L.)<br>\
-A2-  قدّد عَلَيهِ, said of a<br>\
garment, It fitted him, or suited him, in size and<br>\
length. (L, from a trad.)<br>\
4<br>\
اقدّ عَلَيْهِ, said of food, (assumed tropical:)  It occasioned him<br>\
a pain in the belly, termed قُدَاد. (IKtt, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَقَدَّ3َ see 7. ―<br>\
-b2-  تقدّد said of a garment, or piece<br>\
of cloth, It was, or became, much slit or rent. or<br>\
ragged, or tattered, (O, K, TA,) and old and<br>\
worn out. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And, said of flesh-meat,<br>\
quasi-pass. of 2, [i. e. It was, or became, cut into<br>\
strips, or oblong pieces, and spread in the sun, or<br>\
salted and spread in the sun, and so dried.]. (O.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And, said of a company of men (قَوْمٌ), It<br>\
became separated (S, M, O, L, K) into قِدَد [or<br>\
parties, &amp;c., pl. of قِدَّةٌ, q. v.]. (M, L.) ―<br>\
-b5-  Also,<br>\
said of a thing, (TA,) [perhaps from the same v.<br>\
said of flesh-meat,] It was, or became, dry; or<br>\
it dried, or dried up. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And تقدّدت<br>\
said of a she-camel, She became somewhat lean<br>\
(O, K) after having been fat: (O:) or she<br>\
became fat, (TA,) or began to become fat, after<br>\
having been lean. (K, TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انقدّ, (S, M, A, O, L, Msb, K,) and ↓ تقدّد,<br>\
(M, L, K,) [but the latter app. has an intensive<br>\
signification, or is said of a number of things,]<br>\
the former said of a skin, and of a garment, or<br>\
piece of cloth, (A,) not said of aught except<br>\
some such thing as a bag for travelling-provisions<br>\
and for goods or utensils &amp;c., and such as clothing, (O,) It became cut in an elongated form; or<br>\
lengthwise: (L, K:) or became slit, split, cloven,<br>\
rent, or divided, lengthwise: (S, M, A, O, L, Msb,<br>\
K:) or became cut off entirely: (M, L, K:) or<br>\
became cut, or cut off. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِقْتَدَ3َ see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  اقتدّ الأُمُورَ means<br>\
(tropical:)  He considered the affairs, forcasting their issues,<br>\
or results, and discriminated them: (S, O, K:)<br>\
or he devised the affairs, and considered what<br>\
would be their issues, or results. (M.)<br>\
10<br>\
استقدّ (tropical:)  It contained, or continued in one<br>\
manner, or state. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, A, O, K,) لَهُ to<br>\
him. (A.) And (assumed tropical:)  It (an affair, TA) was, or<br>\
became, uniform, or even in its tenour. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, O, K, TA.) And استقدّت الإِبِلُ (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
camels went on undeviatingly, in one course, way,<br>\
or manner: (O, K:) so says AA. (O.)<br>\
قَدْ is a noun and a particle: (S, O, Mughnee,<br>\
K:) and as a noun it is used in two ways.<br>\
(Mughnee, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (I) It is a noun syn. with<br>\
حَسْبُ; (S, O, Mughnee, K;) generally used<br>\
indeclinably; (Mughnee, K;) thus accord. to<br>\
the Basrees; with the د quiescent; (TA;)<br>\
because resembling قَدْ the particle in respect of<br>\
the letters composing it, and many other particles<br>\
in respect of its form, (Mughnee, TA,) such as<br>\
عَنْ and بَلْ &amp;c.: (TA:) one says, قَدْ زَيْدٍ دِرْهَمٌ<br>\
[The sufficiency of Zeyd (i. e. what is sufficient<br>\
for Zeyd) is a dirhem], (Mughnee, K,) with the<br>\
د quiescent; (Mughnee, * K, * TA;) and قَدِى<br>\
(S, O) and قَدْنِى (S, O, Mughnee) [both] meaning حَسْبِى [My sufficiency (i. e. what is sufficient<br>\
for me)]; (S, O;) the ن in قَدْنِى being inserted in order to preserve the quiescence [of the<br>\
final letter of the noun] because this is the<br>\
original characteristic of what they make indeclinable; (Mughnee;) but the insertion of the<br>\
ن in this case is anomalous, for it is [by rule]<br>\
only added in verbs, by way of precaution, [to<br>\
prevent the confusion of the pronominal affix of<br>\
the verb and that of the noun,] as in ضَرَبَنِى: (S,<br>\
O:) [see, however, in the next sentence, an explanation of قَدْنِى accord. to which the ن is inserted regularly:] accord. to Yaakoob, using قَدْ<br>\
in the sense of حَسْبُ, one says, مَا لَكَ عِنْدِى إِلَّا<br>\
هٰذَا فَقَدْ i. e. فَقَطْ [There is nothing for thee with<br>\
me, or nothing due to thee in my possession,<br>\
except this, and it is a thing sufficient, or it is<br>\
enough, فَقَطْ being held to signify properly<br>\
فَحَسْبُ, but it is commonly used as meaning and<br>\
no more]; and he asserts it [i. e. قَدْ] to be a substitute [for قَطْ]: (M:) and it is also used<br>\
declinably; (Mughnee, K;) thus accord. to the<br>\
Koofees; (TA;) but this is rare: (Mughnee:)<br>\
one says قَدُ زَيْدٍ, making it marfooa, (Mughnee,<br>\
K,) like as one says حَسْبُهُ; and قَدِى without<br>\
ن [as mentioned above,] like as one says<br>\
حَسْبِى. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (2) It is also a verbal<br>\
noun, syn. with يَكْفِى: one says, قَدْ زَيْدًا دِرْهَمٌ<br>\
[A dirhem suffices, or will suffice, Zeyd], and<br>\
قَدْنِى دِرْهَمٌ [A dirhem suffices, or will suffice,<br>\
me]; (Mughnee, K;) like as one says يَكْفِى زَيْدًا<br>\
دِرْهَمٌ, and يَكْفِيْنِى دِرْهَمٌ. (Mughnee, K. *)<br>\
-A2-  As<br>\
a particle, it is used peculiarly with a verb,<br>\
(Mughnee, K,) [i. e.] as such it is not preposed<br>\
to anything except a verb, (S, O,) either a pret.<br>\
or an aor., (TA,) from which it is not separated<br>\
unless by an oath, (Mughnee,) such as is perfectly inflected, enunciative, (Mughnee, K,) not<br>\
an imperative, (TA,) affirmative, and free from<br>\
anything that would render it mejzoom or man-<br>\
soob, and from what is termed حَرْف تَنْفِيس [i. e.<br>\
سَوْفُ and its variants]: and it has six meanings.<br>\
(Mughnee, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (1) It denotes expectation:<br>\
(M, Mughnee, K:) and when it is with an aor.,<br>\
this is evident; (Mughnee;) one says قَدْ يَقْدَمُ<br>\
الغَائِبُ, (Mughnee, K,) meaning It is expected<br>\
that the absent will come: (TA:) and most<br>\
affirm that it is thus used with a pret.: (Mughnee:) accord. to some, (M,) it is used in reply<br>\
to the saying لَمَّا يَفْعَلْ [i. e. “ He has not yet<br>\
done ” such a thing, which implies expectation<br>\
that he would do it]; (S, M, O;) the reply<br>\
being, قَدْفَعَلَ [Already he has done the thing]:<br>\
(M:) and Kh asserts that it is used in reply<br>\
to persons expecting information; (S, M, * O,<br>\
Mughnee;) [for to such] you say, قَدْ مَاتَ فَلَانٌ<br>\
[Already such a one has died]; but if one inform<br>\
him who does not expect it, he does not say thus,<br>\
but he says [merely] مَاتَ فُلَانٌ: (S, O:) thus<br>\
some say قَدْ رَكِبَ الأَمِيرُ [Already the commander has mounted his horse] to him who expects his mounting: some, however, disallow<br>\
that قَدْ is used to denote expectation with the<br>\
pret. because the pret. denotes what is already<br>\
past; and hence it appears that those who affirm<br>\
it to be so used mean that the pret. denotes<br>\
what was expected before the information:<br>\
(Mughnee: [in which it is added, with some<br>\
other observations, that, in the opinion of its<br>\
author, it does not denote expectation even with<br>\
the aor.; because the saying يَقْدَمُ الغَئِبُ denotes<br>\
expectation without قَدْ:]) MF says, What we<br>\
have been orally taught by the sheykhs in ElAndalus is this, that it is a particle denoting the<br>\
affirmation of truth, or certainty, when it occurs<br>\
before a pret., and a particle denoting expectation<br>\
when it occurs before a future. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (2)<br>\
It denotes the nearness of the past to the present:<br>\
(O, Mughnee, K:) so in the saying قَدْ قَامَ زَيْدٌ<br>\
[Zeyd has just, or just now, stood; a meaning<br>\
often intended by saying merely, has stood];<br>\
(Mughnee, K;) for this phrase without قد may<br>\
mean the near past and the remote past;<br>\
(Mughnee;) and so in the saying of the muëdhdhin, قَدْ قَامَتِ الصَّلَاةُ [The time of the rising to<br>\
prayer has just come, or simply has come]: (O:)<br>\
[and, when thus used, it is often immediately<br>\
preceded by the pret. or aor. of the verb كَانَ;<br>\
thus you say, كَانَ قَدْ ذَهَبَ He had just, or<br>\
simply had, gone away; and يَكُونُ قَدْ ذَهَبَ He<br>\
will, or shall, have just, or simply have gone<br>\
away:] and accord. to the Basrees, except Akh,<br>\
it must be either expressed or understood immediately before a pret. used as a denotative of<br>\
state; as in [the saying in the Kur ii. 247,]<br>\
وَمَا لَنَا أَلَّا نُقَاتِلُ فِى سَبِيلِ اللّٰهِ وَقَدْ أُخْرِجْنَا مِنْ دِيَارِنَا<br>\
وَأَبْنَائِنَا [And what reason have we that we should<br>\
not fight in the cause of God when we have been<br>\
expelled from our abodes and our children?]; and<br>\
in [the saying in the Kur iv. 92,] أَوْ جَاؤُوكُمْ<br>\
حَصِرَتْ صُدُورُهُمْ أنْ يُقَاتِلُوكَمْ [Or who come to<br>\
you, their bosoms being contracted so that they<br>\
are incapable of fighting you, or their bosoms<br>\
shrinking from fighting you]; but the Koofees<br>\
and Akh says that this is not required, because<br>\
of the frequent occurrence of the pret. as a denotative of state without قَدْ, and [because] the<br>\
primary rule is that there should be no meaning,<br>\
or making, anything to be understood, more<br>\
especially in the case of that which is in frequent<br>\
use: (Mughnee:) Sb [however] does not allow<br>\
the use of the pret. as a denotative of state without قَدْ; and he makes حصرت صدورهم to be an<br>\
imprecation [meaning may their bosoms become<br>\
contracted]: (S in art. حصر; in which art. in<br>\
the present work see more on this subject:) and<br>\
the inceptive لَ is prefixed to it like of the saying,<br>\
إِنَّ زَيْدًا لَقَدْ قَامَ [Verily Zeyd has just stood, or<br>\
has stood]; because the primary rule is that it is<br>\
to be prefixed to the noun, and it is prefixed to<br>\
the aor. because it resembles the noun, and when<br>\
the pret. denotes a time near to the present it resembles the aor. and therefore it is allowable to<br>\
prefix it thereto. (Mughnee.) [See also the<br>\
two sentences next after what is mentioned below<br>\
as the sixth meaning.] ―<br>\
-b4-  (3) It denotes rareness,<br>\
or paucity; (Mughnee, K;) either of the act<br>\
signified by the verb, (Mughnee,) as in [the<br>\
saying], قَدْ يَصْدُقُ الكَذُوبُ [In some few instances<br>\
the habitual liar speaks truth]; (Mughnee, K;)<br>\
or of what is dependent upon that act, as in [the<br>\
saying in the Kur xxiv. last verse,] قَدْ يَعْلَمُ مَا<br>\
أَنْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ [as though] meaning أَنَّ مَا هُمْ عَلَيْهِ هُوَ<br>\
أَقَلُّ مَعْلُومَاتِهِ [so that it should be rendered At<br>\
least He knoweth that state of conduct and mind<br>\
to which ye are conforming yourselves]: but some<br>\
assert that in these exs. and the like thereof it<br>\
denotes the affirmation of truth, or certainty; [as<br>\
will be shown hereafter;] and that the denoting<br>\
of rareness, or paucity, in the former ex. is not<br>\
inferred from قَدْ, but from the saying الكَذُوبُ<br>\
يَصْدُقٌ. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b5-  (4) It denotes frequency; (Mughnee, K;) [i. e.] sometimes (S,<br>\
O) it is used as syn. with رُبَّمَا [as denoting frequency, as well as with رُبَّمَا in the contr. sense,<br>\
mentioned in the next preceding sentence]: (S,<br>\
M, O:) thus in the saying (S, M, O, Mughnee,<br>\
K) of the Hudhalee, (M, Mughnee,) or &#39;Abeed<br>\
Ibn-El-Abras, (IB, TA,)<br>\
قَدْ أَتْرُكُ القِرْنَ مُصْفَرًّا أَنَامِلُهُ<br>\
[Often I leave the antagonist having his fingers&#39;<br>\
ends become yellow]. (S, M, O, Mughnee, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
(5) It denotes the affirmation of truth, or certainty: thus in [the saying in the Kur xci. 9,]<br>\
قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ زَكَّاهَا [Verily, or certainly, or<br>\
indeed, or really, he prospereth, or will prosper,<br>\
who purifieth it; (namely, his soul;) each pret.<br>\
here occupying the place of a mejzoom aor.]:<br>\
(Mughnee, K:) and thus accord. to some in [the<br>\
saying in the Kur xxiv. last verse, of which<br>\
another explanation has been given above,] قَدْ<br>\
يَعْلَمُ مَا أَنْتُمْ عَلَيْهِ [Verily, or certainly, &amp;c., He<br>\
knoweth that state of conduct and mind to which<br>\
ye are conforming yourselves]. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
(6) It denotes negation, (Mughnee, K,) accord.<br>\
to ISd, (Mughnee,) occupying the place of مَا,<br>\
(M,) in the saying, قَدْ كُنْتَ فِى خَيْرٍ فَتَعْرِفَهُ,<br>\
(M, Mughnee, K,) with تعرف mansoob, [as<br>\
though meaning Thou wast not in prosperity,<br>\
that thou shouldst know it,] (Mughnee, K,) heard<br>\
from one of the chaste in speech: (M:) but this<br>\
is strange. (Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b8-  [When it is used to<br>\
denote the nearness of the past to the present, as<br>\
appears to be indicated by the context in the O,]<br>\
قَدْ may be separated from the verb by an oath;<br>\
as in قَدْ وَاللّٰهِ أَحْسَنْتَ [Thou hast, by God, done<br>\
well] and قَدْ لَعَمْرِى بِتُّ سَاهِرًا [I have, by my<br>\
life, or by my religion, passed the night sleepless].<br>\
(O, Mughnee. [In the latter, this and what<br>\
here next follows are mentioned before the explanations of the meanings of the particle; probably because the meaning in these cases can<br>\
hardly be mistaken.]) And the verb may be<br>\
suppressed after it, (M, * O, Mughnee,) when its<br>\
meaning is apprehended, (O,) or because of an<br>\
indication; (Mughnee;) as in the saying of En-Nábighah (M, O, Mughnee) Edh-Dhubyánee,<br>\
(O,)<br>\
أَفِدَ التَّرَحُّلُ غَيْرَ أَنَّ رِكَابَنَا<br>\
لَمَّا تَزُلْ بِرِحَالِنَا وَكَأَنْ قَدِ<br>\
[The time of departure has drawn near, though<br>\
the camels that we ride have not left with our<br>\
utensils and apparatus for travelling, but it is as<br>\
though they had (left)]; meaning كَأَنْ قَدْ زَالَتْ.<br>\
(M, O, Mughnee.) ―<br>\
-b9-  If you make قَدْ an اِسْم [i. e.<br>\
a subst. or a proper name], you characterize it by<br>\
teshdeed: therefore you say, كَتَبْتُ قَدًّا حَسَنَةً [I<br>\
wrote a beautiful قد]; and so you do in the case<br>\
of كَىْ and هُوَ and لَوْ; because these words have<br>\
no indication of what is deficient in them [supposing them to be originally of three radical<br>\
letters], therefore it is requisite to add to the last<br>\
letter of each what is of the same kind as it, and<br>\
this is incorporated into it: but not in the case of<br>\
ا; for in this case you add ء; thus if you name a<br>\
man لَا, or مَا, and then add at the end of it ا, you<br>\
make it ء; for you make the second ا movent,<br>\
and ا when movent becomes ء: (S, O:) so says<br>\
J, [and Sgh has followed him in the O,] and<br>\
such is the opinion of Akh and of a number of<br>\
the grammarians of El-Basrah [and of El-Koofeh<br>\
(MF)], and F has quoted this passage in the B<br>\
and left it uncontradicted: but IB says, (TA,)<br>\
[and after him F in the K,] this is a mistake:<br>\
that only is characterized by teshdeed of which<br>\
the last letter is infirm: you say, for هُوَ, (IB, K,)<br>\
used as the name of a man, (IB,) هُوٌّ, (IB, K,)<br>\
and for لَوْ you say لَوٌّ, and for فِى you say فِىٌّ;<br>\
(IB;) and such is characterized by teshdeed only<br>\
in order that the word may not be reduced to one<br>\
letter on account of the quiescence of the infirm<br>\
letter [which would disappear] with tenween [as<br>\
it does in دَمٌ and يَدٌ &amp;c.]: (K:) but as to قَدْ, if<br>\
you use it as a name, you say قَدٌ; (IB, K;) and<br>\
for مَنْ you say مَنٌ, and for عَنْ you say عَنٌ;<br>\
(K;) like يَدٌ (IB, K) and دَمٌ &amp;c.: (K:) F,<br>\
however, [following IB,] is wrong in calling J&#39;s<br>\
statement a mistake; though the rule given by<br>\
him [and IB] is generally preferred. (MF,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
قَدٌّ The skin of a lamb or kid: (M, A, L, Msb,<br>\
K:) or [only] of a kid: (S, O, L:) or, accord.<br>\
to IDrd, a small skin, but of what kind he does<br>\
not say: (M, L:) pl. (of pauc., S) أَقُدٌّ and (of<br>\
mult., S) قِدَادٌ (ISk, S, M, L, Msb, K) and [of<br>\
pauc. also] أَقِدَّةٌ, which is extr. (M, L.) Hence<br>\
the saying, ↓ فُلَانٌ مَا يَعْرِفُ القَدَّ مِنَ القِدِّ Such a<br>\
one knows not the skin of a lamb, or kid, from the<br>\
thong. (A.) And hence, (O, K,) it is said in a<br>\
prov., (S, M, A, O,) مَا يَجْمَلُ قَدَّكَ إِلَى أَدِيمِكَ<br>\
(S, M, A, O, K) What approximates thy skin<br>\
of a lamb, or kid, to thy hide [of a full-grown<br>\
beast]? meaning, accord. to Th, (assumed tropical:)  what makes<br>\
the great to be like the little? (M: [or the little<br>\
to be like the great?]) or meaning what induces<br>\
thee to make thy small affair [appear] great?<br>\
(S:) or what approximates thy small [affair] to<br>\
thy great? (O, K:) applied to him who transgresses his proper limit; (M, O, K;) and to him<br>\
who compares the contemptible with the noble.<br>\
(O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also قِدٌّ, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  Also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The measure, quantity, size, or bulk, (M, L,<br>\
Msb, K,) of a thing: (M, L:) (tropical:)  the conformation, or proportion, syn. تَقْطِيع, (S, M, A, O,<br>\
L, K,) of a thing, (M, L,) or of a young woman,<br>\

يَا وَيْلَ قَدٍّ, addressed to Mikdád, in a verse of<br>\
Jereer, is meant يَا وَيْلَ مِقْدَادٍ [O, woe to thee<br>\

قِدَّةٌ: see قِدٌّ. ―<br>\

O, K, TA,) such as the repairer of cracked wooden<br>\
bowls, and the farrier, (O, K, TA,) and the<br>\
blacksmith: (O, TA:) of the dial. of the people<br>\
of Syria: as though they were called by the<br>\
former appellation because of the tattered state of<br>\

small مِسْح called قُدَيْد; or from التَّقَدُّدُ, because<br>\
they disperse themselves in the provinces on account of need, and because of the tattered state of<br>\

in the Nh and Ghareebeyn; and sometimes it is<br>\
pronounced without teshdeed to the د. (TA.)<br>\
