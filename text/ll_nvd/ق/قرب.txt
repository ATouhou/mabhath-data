قَرُبَ, aor.<br>\
قَرُبَ, inf. n. قُرْبٌ (S, Mgh, O, Msb *)<br>\
and قُرْبَةٌ and قَرَابَةٌ and قُرْبَى (Mgh, Msb) and<br>\
مَقْرَبَةٌ, (Mgh,) [to which may be added some<br>\
other syns. mentioned below with قُرْبٌ and قَرَابَةٌ,]<br>\
It, and he, was, or became, near; (S, Mgh, O;)<br>\
syn. دَنَا; (S, O;) contr. of بَعُدَ: (Mgh:) or<br>\
قُرْبٌ is in place, and قُرْبَةٌ is in station, or grade,<br>\
or rank, and قَرَابَةٌ and قُرْبَى are in الرَّحِم [meaning relationship, or relationship by the female<br>\
side]; (Mgh, Msb, TA;) or, accord. to the T,<br>\
قَرَابَةٌ is in النَّسَب [app. relationship in a general<br>\
sense], and قُرْبَى is in الرَّحِم [app. as meaning<br>\
relationship by the female side]: (TA:) You say,<br>\
قَرُبَ مِنْهُ, (A, MA, Msb, K,) and إِلَيْهِ; (A;) and<br>\
قَرِبَهُ, (S, MA, O, K,) aor.<br>\
قَرَبَ; (S, K;) inf. n.<br>\
(of the former verb, Msb) قُرْبٌ, (Msb, K,) or<br>\
قُرْبٌ and قُرْبَةٌ &amp;c. as above, (Msb,) or قُرْبٌ and<br>\
مَقْرَبَةٌ and مَقْرُبَةٌ; (MA;) and (of the latter verb,<br>\
S, MA, O) قِرْبَانٌ (S, MA, O, K) and قُرْبَانٌ;<br>\
(K;) he (a man, S, O) was, or became, near to<br>\
it; (S, A, MA, O, K;) syn. دَنَا: (S, A, O, K:)<br>\
or the former verb means thus; but when one<br>\
says لَا تَقْرَبْ كَذَا with fet-h to the ر, the meaning<br>\
is, occupy not thyself with doing such a thing: (MF,<br>\
TA, &amp;c.:) or قَرِبْتُ الأَمْرَ, aor.<br>\
قَرَبَ, and قَرَبْتُهُ, aor.<br>\
قَرُبَ,<br>\
i. e., like تَعِبَ and like قَتَلَ, inf. n. قِرْبَانٌ,<br>\
signifies I did the thing, or affair; or I was, or<br>\
became, near, or I approached, to it, or to doing<br>\
it [or to doing something with it or to it]: an ex.<br>\
of the former meaning is the saying [in the Kur<br>\
xvii. 34], لَا تَقْرَبُوا الزِّنَا [Commit not ye fornication, or adultery; or, accord. to some, this is<br>\
an ex. of the latter meaning]; and hence one<br>\
says, قَرِبْتُ المَرْأَةَ, inf. n. قِرْبَانٌ, a metonymical<br>\
phrase, meaning I compressed the woman: and<br>\
an ex. of the latter meaning is the saying, لَا<br>\
تَقْرَبُوا الحِمَى i. e. لَا تَدْنُوا مِنْهُ [meaning<br>\
Approach not ye to doing, or to entering upon,<br>\
the thing, or place, that is prohibited, or interdicted]. (Msb.) And the Arabs say, of a<br>\
man, when a thing has disquieted, or disturbed,<br>\
and grieved, him, أَخَذَهُ مَا قَرُبَ وَمَا بَعُدَ, as though<br>\
meaning (assumed tropical:)  He became, or has become, disquieted<br>\
by reason of near and remote circumstances of<br>\
his case: (O:) or recent and old griefs took hold<br>\
upon him. (Mgh in art. قدم. [See art. بعد.])<br>\
دَنَا مِنِّى وَقَرُبَ is expl. by Zj as meaning He drew<br>\
near to me and drew nearer. (T in art. دلو: see<br>\
5 in that art.) [And several other verbs belonging to this art. are syn., or nearly so, with قَرُبَ<br>\
or with قَرِبَ in senses expl. above. Thus ↓ اقرب<br>\
is syn. with قَرُبَ in the first of the senses expl.<br>\
above, like as أَدْنَى is with دَنَا, for its inf. n.]<br>\
الإِقْرَابُ signifies الدُّبُوُّ. (TA.) ↓ اقترب, also, is<br>\
syn. with قَرُبَ in the first of the senses expl.<br>\
above; (MA;) [i. e.] it is syn. with دَنَا: (Msb:)<br>\
or it is syn. with ↓ تقارب, (S, O, K, TA,) signifying he, or it, drew near; (TA;) thus ↓ وَاقْتَرَبَ<br>\
الوَعْدُ [in the Kur xxi. 97] signifies تقارب [meaning And the fulfilment of the promise shall draw<br>\
near]: (S, O, TA:) and you say, اقترب مِنِّى<br>\
[meaning He drew near to me]: (A:) it is also<br>\
said that is has a more particular signification<br>\
than قَرُبَ; for it denotes intensiveness in القُرْب;<br>\
thus says Ibn-&#39;Arafeh; probably meaning that<br>\
it denotes labour and difficulty in the accomplishment of the act. (MF, TA.) ↓ تقرّب [likewise] is syn. with [قَرُبَ, i. e.] دَنَا, in the phrase<br>\
تقرّب مِنْهُ: (O: [see قَرُبَ مِنْهُ:]) or it signifies<br>\
he drew near, or approached, by little and little,<br>\
(تَدَنَّى,) to a thing. (TA.) And الشَّىْءَ ↓ قارب,<br>\
(ISd, TA,) or الأَمْرَ, (Msb,) [like قَرِبَهُ in many<br>\
instances,] signifies He was, or became, near, or<br>\
he approached, to the thing, or affair, or to doing<br>\
it. (ISd, Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  قَرُبَ, aor.<br>\
قَرُبَ, inf. n. قُرْبٌ<br>\
signifies also (assumed tropical:)  He formed an opinion that was<br>\
near to certainty. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b3-  In the phrase قَرَبَتِ<br>\
الشَّمْسُ لِلْمَغِيبِ [meaning The sun was, or became,<br>\
near to setting], like كَرَبَت, the ق is asserted by<br>\
Yaakoob to be a substitute for ك. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
قَرَبَ, aor.<br>\
قَرُبَ; inf. in. قِرَابَةٌ, He (a man) journeyed<br>\
to water, there being between him and it a night&#39;s<br>\
journey. (S, O.) [See also أَقْرَبَ القَوْمُ. Or,]<br>\
accord. to Lth, you say, قَرَبُوا, aor.<br>\
قَرُبَ, inf. n. قَرَبٌ<br>\
[q. v.], meaning They, after pasturing their<br>\
camels in the tract between them and the wateringplace, and journeying on during a part of the<br>\
time until there remained between them and the<br>\
water a night, or an evening, hastened in their<br>\
course. (TA.) And قَرَبَ الإِبِل [in some copies<br>\
of the K الإِبِلَ and in others الإِبِلُ], aor.<br>\
قَرُبَ, inf. n.<br>\
قِرَابَةٌ; thus in the K; but accord. to Th, قَرَبَتِ<br>\
الإِبِلُ, aor.<br>\
قَرُبَ, inf. n. قَرَبٌ; (TA;) i. e. The camels<br>\
journeyed by night in order to arrive at the water<br>\
on the morrow: (K, * TA:) and [a man says, of<br>\
himself,] قَرَبْتُ, aor.<br>\
قَرُبَ, inf. n. قِرَابَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And قَرَبْتُ المَآءَ, aor.<br>\
قَرُبَ, inf. n. قَرَبٌ, so in the Fs<br>\
[of Th, meaning I journeyed to the water by<br>\
night in order to reach it on the following morning].<br>\
(TA.) [Or] you say, قَرَبُوا المَآءَ, meaning They<br>\
sought, or sought to attain, the water. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And [hence] one says, فُلَانٌ يَقْرُبُ حَاجَتُهُ, meaning<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Such a one seeks, or seeks to attain, the object of<br>\
his want; from the seeking, or seeking to attain,<br>\
the water: and hence the saying, in a trad.,<br>\
وَإِنْ نَقْرُبُ بِذٰلِكَ إِلَّا أَنْ نَحْمَدَ اللّٰهَ (assumed tropical:)  We not seeking<br>\
thereby [aught] save our praising God: thus<br>\
expl. by El-Khattábee. (Az, TA.) [Hence,<br>\
also,] one says قَدْ قَرَبَ أَمْرًا لَا أَدْرِى مَا هُوَ (tropical:)  [He<br>\
has sought to accomplish an affair, I know not<br>\
what it is]: (A, O: *) and فُلَانٌ يَقْرُبُ أَمْرًا لَا<br>\
يَسْهُلُ لَهُ (tropical:)  [Such a one seeks to accomplish an<br>\
affair that will not be easy to him]. (A.) فُلَانٌ<br>\
يَقْرُبُ أَمْرًا means (assumed tropical:)  Such a one seeks, desires, or<br>\
aims at, [the accomplishment of] an affair,<br>\
when he does a deed, or says a saying, with that<br>\
object. (T, O, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  قَرَبَ السَّيْفَ, (S, O,)<br>\
inf. n. قَرْبٌ; (K;) and ↓ اقربهُ, (O,) inf. n.<br>\
إِقْرَابٌ; (K;) He put the sword into the قِرَاب<br>\
[q. v.]: (S, O, K:) or the former, (accord. to<br>\
the K,) or ↓ the latter, (accord. to the S and TA,)<br>\
he made for the sword a قِرَاب: (S, K, TA:) or<br>\
↓ the latter has both of these significations: (O:)<br>\
or the former verb is said of a sword or of a<br>\
knife in the former sense; and in like manner<br>\
↓ the latter verb in the latter sense: or the former<br>\
phrase signifies he made for the sword a قِرَاب;<br>\
and ↓ the latter phrase, he put the sword into its<br>\
قِرَاب: and one says, قِرَابًا ↓ قرّب and ↓ اقربهُ,<br>\
meaning he made a قِرَاب. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  قَرْبٌ [as an<br>\
inf. n. of which the verb is قَرَبَ] also signifies<br>\
The feeding a guest with the أَقْرَاب (O, K, TA)<br>\
meaning flanks [of an animal or of animals, pl.<br>\
of قُرْبٌ or قُرُبٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
-A5-  And قَرِبَ, (O, K,)<br>\
with kesr to the ر, (O,) like فَرِح, (K,) [aor.<br>\
قَرَبَ,<br>\
inf. n. app. قَرَبٌ,] He (a man, TA) had a<br>\
complaint (O, K) of his قُرْب or قُرُب, (K,) [i. e.]<br>\
of his flank; (O;) as also ↓ قرّب, (O, * K, [in the<br>\
former this verb is only indicated by the mention<br>\
of its inf. n.,]) inf. n. تَقْرِيبٌ. (O, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
قرّبهُ, inf. n. تَقْرِيبٌ, He made, or caused, to<br>\
be, or become, near, caused to approach, or<br>\
brought, or drew, near, him, or it. (S, O, Msb. *)<br>\
[Hence the phrase قَرَّبَ اللّٰهُ دَارَكَ, which see in<br>\
what follows.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence, He made him to<br>\
be a near associate; he made him an object of, or<br>\
took him into, favour: and (agreeably with an<br>\
explanation of the pass. in the Ham p. 184) he<br>\
made him, or rendered him, an object of honour.]<br>\
One says, قَرَّبَهُ مِنْهُ meaning He (a king, or a<br>\
governor, or prince, [or any other person who<br>\
was either a superioror an equal,]) made him to<br>\
be to him a قُرْبَان, i. e. [a near associate, or] a<br>\
consessor, or a particular, or special, associate or<br>\
companion [&amp;c.: see قُرْبَانٌ]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  قَرَّبَهُ إِلَيْهِمْ,<br>\
in the Kur li. 27, means He presented it, or<br>\
offered it, to them: (Jel:) or he placed it, or put<br>\
it, before them. (Bd.) And one says also, قرّب<br>\
خَصْمَهُ إِلَى السُّلْطَانِ [He brought, or placed, his<br>\
adversary before the Sultán]. (Mgh in art. رفع.)<br>\
And ↓ قرّب لِلّٰهِ قَرْبَانًا [He offered, or presented, to<br>\
God, an offering, or oblation]. (S, O: in the<br>\
Msb, إِلَى اللّٰهِ.) ―<br>\
-b4-  حَيَّا وَقَرَّبَ, (A, O,) inf. n.<br>\
تَقْرِيبٌ, (K,) signifies (tropical:)  He said, حَيَّاكَ اللّٰهُ وَقَرَّبَ<br>\
دَارَكَ [May God preserve thee alive, or prolong<br>\
thy life, and make thine abode to be near]: (A, O,<br>\
K:) one says thus of a host to a visitor. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  And التَّقْرِيبُ signifies also The denoting nearness. (Mughnee and K * voce أَوْ, and Kull pp.<br>\
82 and 83 and 124.) Thus what is termed<br>\
تَصْغِيرُ التَّقْرِيبِ [The diminutive denoting nearness]<br>\
is such as occurs in the saying, دَارِى قُبَيْلَ المَسْجِدِ<br>\
[“ My house is a little before the mosque ”].<br>\
(Kull p. 124.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And The advancing an argument in such a manner as renders the desired conclusion a necessary consequence. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And<br>\
A certain sort of عَدْو [or running] (S, O, K) of<br>\
a horse: (S, O:) one says, of a horse, قرّب,<br>\
inf. n. تَقْرِيبٌ, (S, A, O,) meaning he raised his<br>\
fore legs together and put them down together<br>\
(S, O, K *) in running: (S, O:) or he ran [as<br>\
though] pelting the ground [with his hoofs]: (AZ,<br>\
TA:) and it is also said of other animals than<br>\
the horse: but not of the camel: (MF:) [one<br>\
sort of] التقريب is [a rate] less than الحُضْرُ; (S,<br>\
A, O;) and more than الخَبَبُ: (El-Ámidee,<br>\
MF:) there are two sorts of تقريب, called أَعْلَى<br>\
[which is a gallop] and أَدْنَى [which is a canter]:<br>\
(S, O:) the former is termed الثَّعْلَبِيَّةُ; and the<br>\
latter, الإِرْخَآءُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, near the end,<br>\
in two places.<br>\
3<br>\
قَارَبْتُهُ, inf. n. مُقَارَبَةٌ [and قِرَابٌ], I was, or<br>\
became, near to him, or it; contr. of بَاعَدْتُهُ.<br>\
(Msb.) See 1, near the middle of the paragraph.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  One says of a vessel, (S, O, K,) قارب أَنْ<br>\
يَمْتَلِئَ (S, O) or قارب الاِمْتِلَآءَ (K) [It was, or<br>\
became, near to being full]: قارب [thus used] is<br>\
the verb from قَرْبَانُ [q. v.], and قَرُبَ is not used<br>\
in its stead. (Sb, TA.) And one says also,<br>\
قارب مِلْأَهُ [It was, or became, nearly equal, or it<br>\
nearly amounted, to what would fill it]. (Msb.),<br>\
And قارب قَدْرَهُ [It was, or became, nearly equal,<br>\
or equivalent, to its quantity, or amount; or it<br>\
was, or became, nearly equivalent to it]. (K,<br>\
TA.) [And hence the term أَفْعَالُ المُقَارَبَةِ The<br>\
verbs of appropinquation; as كَادَ &amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b3-  قارب<br>\
الخَطْوَ He made the stepping to be contracted;<br>\
syn. دَانَاهُ; (AZ, K, TA;) [i. e. he made short<br>\
steps: made his steps to be near together;] said<br>\
of a horse. (TA.) And قارب كَلَامَهُ [He made<br>\
the several portions of his speech, i. e. he made his<br>\
words, to be near together; so that it means he<br>\
uttered his speech rapidly]. (K in art. وط; &amp;c.) And<br>\
قارب بين الكَلِمَةِ وَالكَلِمَةِ فِى التَّسْبِيحِ [He made the words to follow one another nearly, or to be<br>\
near together, in the act of praise, or the like.]<br>\
(M in art. دنو.) And قَارَبْتُ بَيْنَ الأَمْرَيْنِ i. q.<br>\
دَانَيْتُ [I made the two affairs, or events, to be<br>\
nearly uninterrupted]. (T, S, Msb, all in art.<br>\
دنو.) ―<br>\
-b4-  قاربهُ also signifies He thought him, or it,<br>\
to be near. (Ham p. 634.) And قارب الأَمْرَ He<br>\
thought the thing. (MF.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And He interchanged with him good, or pleasing, speech. (O,<br>\
K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  And قارب فِى الأَمْرِ He pursued the<br>\
right, or just, or middle, course, neither exceeding<br>\
it nor falling short of it, in the affair. (O, * K, *<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And قَارَبْتُهُ فِى البَيْعِ [app. meaning, in<br>\
like manner, I pursued a middle course with him<br>\
in selling, or buying, with respect to the price<br>\
demanded or offered, neither exceeding what was<br>\
just nor falling short of it], (S, O,) inf. n.<br>\
مُقَارَبَةٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b8-  مُقَارَبَةٌ and قِرَابٌ signify also<br>\
The raising the leg [or legs, of a woman,] for the<br>\
purpose of جِمَاع. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَقْرَبَ see 1, second quarter. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] أَقْرَبَت,<br>\
(S, A, O, K,) said of the pregnant, (A, TA,) or<br>\
of a woman, and of a mare, and of a ewe or<br>\
goat, (S, O, TA,) and also of an ass, (Lth, TA,)<br>\
but [app.] not [properly] of a camel, (Lth, S, *<br>\
O, * TA,) [though it is sometimes said of a<br>\
camel, as in the S and O voce غَمُوس, and in the<br>\
O and K in art. ك,] She was, or became, near<br>\
to bringing forth. (Lth, S, A, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
اقرب said of a colt, and of a young camel, (K,<br>\
TA,) &amp;c., (TA,) He was, or became, near to the<br>\
age of shedding his central incisors; (K, TA;)<br>\
and likewise, to that of shedding other teeth.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And He nearly filled a vessel. (S, O,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  لَأُقْرِبَنَّكُمْ صَلَاةَ رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ occurs in a trad.<br>\
of Aboo-Hureyreh, meaning I will indeed perform to you the like of, or what will be nearly<br>\
the same as, the praying of the Apostle of God.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  اقرب الإِبِلَ He made the camels to<br>\
journey by night in order to arrive at the water<br>\
on the morrow: (O, * K, TA:) or اقربوا إِبِلَهُمْ<br>\
They, after pasturing them in the tract between<br>\
them and the watering-place, and journeying on<br>\
during a part of the time until there remained<br>\
between them and the water a night, or an evening,<br>\
hastened their camels. (Lth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And اقرب<br>\
القَوْمُ The people, or party, became persons whose<br>\
camels were performing a journey such as is<br>\
termed قَرَبٌ: the part. n. is [said to be] ↓ قارب,<br>\
not مُقْربٌ: (As, S, O:) the former of these is<br>\
said by A&#39;Obeyd to be anomalous: (S, O:)<br>\
[but see قَرَبَ, which is expl. as having almost<br>\
exactly the same meaning as that which is in<br>\
this instance assigned to اقرب. And it is also<br>\
mentioned in the TA, app. on the authority of<br>\
AA, that the same phrase and the same anomalous part. n. are used when the people&#39;s camels<br>\
are مُتَقَارِبَة (which means few, or near together):<br>\
but I think that this word is a mistake of a<br>\
copyist, for قَوَارِبُ: see قَارِبٌ.]<br>\
-A2-  See also 1, last<br>\
quarter, in six places.<br>\
5<br>\
تَقَرَّبَ see 1, near the middle of the paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence] one says to his companion, urging him,<br>\
تَقَرَّبْ, meaning (tropical:)  Advance thou, or come forward: (A, TA:) or تَقَرَّبْ يا رَجُلُ, meaning<br>\
hasten, O man. (As, O, L, K, TA.) Only the<br>\
imperative mood in this sense is said to be used.<br>\
(MF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence, also,] تقرّب signifies<br>\
He rendered himself near, or allied himself, [drew<br>\
near, or ingratiated himself,] by affection and<br>\
friendship. (TA, voce تَنَسَّبَ. [In this sense it<br>\
is trans. by means of مِنْ.]) And He applied<br>\
himself with gentleness, or courtesy, to obtain<br>\
access, or nearness, to a man, by means of some<br>\
act performed for that purpose, or by right.<br>\
(TA. [In this sense it is trans. by means of<br>\
إِلَى.]) And one says, تقرّب مِنَ اللّٰهِ [He drew<br>\
near unto God] by prayer or the like, and<br>\
righteous actions: and تقرّب اللّٰهُ مِنْهُ [God drew<br>\
near unto him] by beneficence towards him.<br>\
(TA.) And تقرِّب بِهِ إِلَى اللّٰهِ, (S, A, O, Msb,<br>\
K, *) inf. n. تَقَرُّبٌ and تِقِرَّابٌ, (O, K,) the latter<br>\
[of a rare form] like تِحِمَّالٌ and تِكِلَّامٌ and تِمِلَّاقٌ,<br>\
(O,) He sought thereby nearness, to bring himself<br>\
near, to draw near, or to approach, unto God;<br>\
or to advance himself in the favour of God: (S,<br>\
K, * TA:) and فَعَلَهُ تَقَرُّبًا إِلَيْهِ [He did it by way<br>\
of seeking nearness, &amp;c., to Him]. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  تقرّب<br>\
also signifies He (a man, O) put his hand upon<br>\
his قُرْب (O, K, TA) i. e. his flank, (O, TA,) in<br>\
walking; or, as some say, hastening, or going<br>\
quickly. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تقاربوا They were, or became, or drew,<br>\
near, one to another: (S, * A, * Msb:) you say<br>\
تقاربوا and ↓ اقتربوا [both app. signifying the<br>\
same, like تخاصموا and اختصموا, and تخالطوا and<br>\
اختلطوا, and تشاركوا and اشتركوا, &amp;c.]. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, second quarter. ―<br>\
-b3-  تقاربت إِبِلُهُ<br>\
means (tropical:)  His camels became few, [because drawing near together,] (A, O, K, TA,) and (as is<br>\
also said of other things, TA) declined, or<br>\
became reduced to a bad state. (O, * K, * TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And [for the like reason, because of its becoming dense,] تقارب is said of seed-produce, or<br>\
standing corn or the like, meaning (assumed tropical:)  It became<br>\
nearly ripe. (O, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And hence [accord.<br>\
to some], تَقَارَبَ الزَّمَانُ (assumed tropical:)  [When the time<br>\
becomes contracted], occurring in a trad., expl. in<br>\
art. زمن, q. v. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِقْتَرَبَ see 1, second quarter, in two places: ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
and see also 6.<br>\
10<br>\
استقربهُ [contr. of استبعدهُ]. One says, هُوَ<br>\
يَسْتَقْرِبُ البَعِيدَ [He reckons near that which is<br>\
remote]. (A, Msb.)<br>\
قُرْبٌ [mentioned in the first sentence of this<br>\
art. as an inf. n.] is the contr. of بُعْدٌ: (S, O:)<br>\
[used as a simple subst., it signifies Nearness,<br>\
and] it is said to be [properly, or primarily,] in<br>\
respect of place; [i. e. vicinity;] as distinguished<br>\
from قُرْبَةٌ &amp;c. (Msb, TA.) You say, إِنَّ قُرْبَكَ<br>\
زَيْدًا [Verily Zeyd is in thy vicinity; i. e., near<br>\
thee in respect of place]; but not إِنَّ بُعْدَكَ زَيْدًا;<br>\
because قُرْب is more capable of being used as an<br>\
adv. n. of place than بُعْد: in like manner they<br>\
said also ↓ هُوَ قُرَابَتَكَ, meaning [He is in thy<br>\
vicinity; i. e.,] near thee in respect of place.<br>\
(Sb, TA. [See also قَرِيبٌ.]) [And بِالقُرْبِ مِنْهُ<br>\
is a phrase of frequent occurrence, meaning In<br>\
the vicinity of, or near in respect of place to,<br>\
him, or it.] And one says, تَنَاوَلَهُ مِنْ قُرْبٍ and<br>\
↓ مِنْ قَرِيبٍ [He took it, or took it with his hand,<br>\
from a near place or spot]. (A, Msb.) And<br>\
رَأَيْتُهُ مِنْ قُرْبٍ [and ↓ مِنْ قَرِيبٍ I saw him, or it,<br>\
from a near place or spot, or from within a<br>\
short distance]. (S in art. ام; &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also<br>\
syn. with ↓ قَرَابٌ [signifying Nearness in respect<br>\
of time] as used in the saying اِفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ بِقَرَابٍ<br>\
[i. e. Do thou that soon; like as one says, عَنْ<br>\
↓ قَرِيبٍ]: (K, TA:) accord. to the K, the word<br>\
قراب in this case is like سَحَاب: but it is said in<br>\
a prov., أَكْيَسُ ↓ الفِرَارُ بِقِرَابٍ, thus in the S, or,<br>\
as some relate it, ↓ بِقُرَابٍ; and IB says, J has<br>\
cited this prov. [next] after the قِرَاب of the<br>\
sword, but should have said that القِرَابُ is also<br>\
syn. with القُرْبُ, and should then have adduced<br>\
the prov. as an ex. meaning The fleeing soon in<br>\
eagerness of desire for safety [is more, or most,<br>\
shrewd]: (TA:) [this rendering, however, requires consideration; for, accord. to Meyd, who<br>\
gives only the reading بِقِرَابٍ, the meaning of the<br>\
prov. is, that he who flees with the ↓ قِرَاب (by<br>\
which is meant the scabbard) when the sword<br>\
has passed away from his possession is more<br>\
shrewd than he who causes, or suffers, the قِرَاب<br>\
also to pass away from him: in Freytag&#39;s Arab<br>\
Prov. ii. 210, both of these explanations are<br>\
given; but قريب is there erroneously put for<br>\
قُرْب.] ―<br>\
-b3-  See also قَرَابَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b4-  It is also a pl. of<br>\
قَرِيبٌ [q. v.]. (TA in art. زلف.)<br>\
-A2-  قُرْبٌ also,<br>\
and ↓ قُرُبٌ, (S, O, K,) the former of which is the<br>\
original, (TA,) signify The خَاصِرَة [or flank]:<br>\
(O, K:) or [the part] from the شَاكِلَة [which is<br>\
syn., or nearly so, with خَاصِرَة,] to the مَرَاقّ [or<br>\
soft parts] of the belly: (S, O, K:) and likewise<br>\
from the رَفْغ [generally meaning groin] to the<br>\
armpit, on each side: (TA:) [properly used in<br>\
relation to a horse:] sometimes metaphorically<br>\
used in relation to a she-camel, and to an ass<br>\
[meaning a wild ass, and also to a man: see 5,<br>\
last sentence]: (TA:) pl. أَقْرَابٌ; (T, S, O, K;)<br>\
which is also used in the place of the dual. (T,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
قَرَبٌ [mentioned in the latter half of the first<br>\
paragraph of this art. as an inf. n.] is [said to be]<br>\
a subst., signifying A journey to water when it is<br>\
a night&#39;s journey distant: or, as As said, on the<br>\
authority of an Arab of the desert, (S, O,) a<br>\
journey by night in order to arrive at the water<br>\
on the morrow; (S, O, K;) and so ↓ قِرَابَةٌ [which<br>\
is also mentioned as an inf. n. in the latter half<br>\
of the first paragraph of this art.]; (K;) a<br>\
journey by night in order to arrive at the water<br>\
on the second following day being called طَلَقٌ:<br>\
(S, O:) and the seeking water by night: or,<br>\
when it is not more than a night&#39;s journey<br>\
distant: or the first day in which one journeys to<br>\
water when it is two days distant; the second day<br>\
being called طَلَقٌ: (K: [but the converse seems<br>\
to be the truth, being asserted by several of the<br>\
highest authorities, and agreeable with the<br>\
derivation of each of the two words: see طَلَقٌ:])<br>\
or the night after which, in the morning, one<br>\
arrives at the water: (TA:) and لَيْلَةُ القَرَبِ is<br>\
the night in which people with their camels<br>\
hasten to the water in a journey such as is termed<br>\
قَرَبٌ بَصْبَاصٌ; this latter term being applied to<br>\
signify a people&#39;s letting their camels pasture<br>\
while they are journeying towards water; and<br>\
when there remains an evening between them and<br>\
the water, hastening towards it: (S, O:) or, as<br>\
is said on the authority of As, لَيْلَةُ القَرَبِ is the<br>\
second night after the pastor has turned the<br>\
faces of his camels towards the water, and so left<br>\
them to pasture; this second night being the<br>\
night of hard driving; and the first night being<br>\
called لَيْلَةُ الطَّلَقِ: accord. to AA, [the journey<br>\
called] القَرَبُ is [the journey to water] during<br>\
three days, or more. (TA.) And [hence] القَرَبَ<br>\
is used to signify What is a night&#39;s journey<br>\
distant. (S in art. نوب, in explanation of a verse<br>\
cited in that art. [Or, accord. to IAar, قَرَب<br>\
there signifies near, so as to be visited repeatedly:<br>\
or, as AA says, at such a distance as to be<br>\
visited once in three days.]) [See also a saying<br>\

قُرْبَةٌ an inf. n. of قَرُبَ [q. v.: and used as a<br>\
simple subst. signifying Nearness]; like قُرْبٌ: or<br>\
the former is in station, or grade, or rank.<br>\
(Mgh, Msb.) You say, طَلَبْتُ مِنْهُ القُرْبَةَ [I<br>\
sought of him nearness of station, &amp;c.; or admission into favour]. (A.) ―<br>\

Also, (A, O, Msb,) and ↓ قُرُبَةٌ, (Msb,) A thing<br>\

whereby one seeks nearness, to bring himself near,<br>\
to draw near, or to approach, unto God; or to<br>\
advance himself in the favour of God; (A, * O,<br>\
Msb;) as also ↓ قُرْبَانٌ: (S, O, Msb, K:) pl. of<br>\
the first and second قُرَبٌ and قُرْبَاتٌ and قُرُبَاتٌ<br>\
and قُرَبَاتٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
قِرْبَةٌ A kind of سِقَآء [or skin], (S, * O, * TA,)<br>\
used for water: (S, O:) or a وَطْب [or skin]<br>\
that is used for milk, and sometimes for water:<br>\
(ISd, K:) or such as is sewed on one side: (K:)<br>\
[the modern قِرْبَة, which is seldom, if ever, used<br>\
for anything but water, is (if I may judge from<br>\
my own observations and the accounts of others)<br>\
always made of the skin of a goat about one year<br>\
old or upwards: it consists of nearly the whole<br>\
skin; only the skin of the head, and a small<br>\
portion of that of each leg, being cut off: it has<br>\
a seam extending from the upper part of the<br>\
throat nearly to the belly, and sometimes a corresponding seam at the hinder part, but more<br>\
commonly only a patch of leather over the fundament and navel: over the seam, or over each<br>\
seam, is sewed a narrow strip of leather; and a<br>\
mouth of leather is added in the place of the head: it<br>\
is carried on the back, by means of a strap, or<br>\
cord, &amp;c., one end of which is generally attached<br>\
to a cord connecting the two fore-legs; and the<br>\
other, to the right hind leg:] the pl. (of pauc.,<br>\
S, O) is قِرْبَاتٌ, and قِرَبَاتٌ, and قِرِبَاتٌ, and (of<br>\
mult., S, O) قِرَبٌ. (S, O, Msb, K.)<br>\
فِيهِ قَرَبَةٌ and ↓ قِرَابَةٌ are said of a vessel that is<br>\

-A2-  See<br>\
also the paragraph here following.<br>\
قُرْبَانٌ: see قُرْبَةٌ: [it may often be rendered An<br>\
offering, or oblation: and hence it sometimes<br>\
means a sacrifice, as in the Kur iii. 179:] pl.<br>\
قَرَابِينُ. (Msb.) قُرْبَانُهُمْ دِمَآؤُهُمْ [Their offering<br>\
to God is their blood, lit. bloods,] occurs in a<br>\
trad. as cited from the Book of the Law revealed<br>\
to Moses, and as referring to the Arabs; meaning, they seek to bring themselves near unto<br>\
God by shedding their blood in fighting in the<br>\
cause of religion; whereas the قربان of preceding<br>\
peoples consisted in the slaughtering of oxen or<br>\
cows, and sheep or goats, and camels. (TA.)<br>\
And it is said in another trad., الصَّلَاةُ قُرْبَانُ كُلِّ<br>\
تَقِىٍّ [The divinely-appointed act of prayer is the<br>\
offering to God of every pious person]; meaning,<br>\
that whereby the pious seek to bring themselves<br>\
near unto God. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (S, A, O, K,)<br>\

one says also, فُلَانٌ مِنْ قُرْبَانِ الأَمِيرِ [Such a one<br>\
is of the near associates, &amp;c., of the governor, or<br>\
prince]; (S, O;) [for] قُرْبَانٌ is [said to be<br>\
originally] an inf. n., and [therefore, as an<br>\
epithet,] the same as sing. and dual and pl.: (so<br>\
in a marginal note in one of my copies of the S:)<br>\

قِرَابٌ [an inf. n. of 3. And hence قِرَابَ as an<br>\

came to him near nightfall: and قِرَابَ اللَّيْلِ near<br>\
night. (Lth, TA.) And &#39;Oweyf El-Kawáfee says,<br>\

هُوَ ابْنُ مُنَضِّجَاتٍ كُنَّ قِدْمًا<br>\
يَزِدْنَ عَلَى العَدِيدِ قِرَابَ شَهْرٍ<br>\
(O, TA) i. e. He is the off spring of [one of the]<br>\

bringing forth, that used formely to exceed the<br>\
computed [time] near a month: J give a<br>\

قِرَابُ الشَّىْءِ and ↓ قُرَابُهُ and ↓ قُرَابَتُهُ signify What<br>\
is nearly the equal in quantity, or amount, or<br>\
nearly the equivalent, of the thing. (K.) One<br>\
says, مَعَهُ أَلْفُ دِرْهَمٍ أَوْ قِرَابُهُ He has with him a<br>\
thousand dirhems, or nearly the equal thereof:<br>\
and مَعَهُ مِلْءُ قَدَحٍ مَآءً أَوْ قِرَابُهُ He has with him<br>\
a cupful of water, or nearly the equal thereof.<br>\
(Lth, TA.) And a poet says, (S,) namely, El-<br>\
&#39;Ambar, (so in the O and TA,) or Es-Sinnabr,<br>\
(so in the Mz, 49th نوع,) Ibn-&#39;Amr, Ibn-Temeem,<br>\
(O, TA, *)<br>\
إِلَّا تَجِئْ مَلْأَى يَجِئْ قِرَابُهَا<br>\
[If a full bucket (دَلْوٌ being understood, as is<br>\
indicated in the S and O and TA,) come not,<br>\
what will be nearly the equal thereof will come].<br>\
(S, O, TA.) One says also, لَوْ أَنَّ لِى قِرَابَ هٰذَا<br>\
ذَهَبًا i. e. [If there belonged to me] the quantity<br>\
nearly sufficient for the filling of this [of gold]:<br>\
and لَوْ جَآءَ بِقِرَابِ الأَرْضِ i. e. [If he brought] that<br>\
which would be nearly the equal in quantity of<br>\
the earth. (Msb.) And الرُّكْبَتَيْنِ ↓ المَآءُ قُرَابَةُ<br>\
[The water is such as is nearly the equal in height<br>\

The غِمْد [i. e. scabbard, or sheath,] of a sword,<br>\
(K, TA,) or of a knife: (TA:) or the جَفْن<br>\
[i. e. case, or receptacle,] of the غِمْد; (K, TA;)<br>\
the جَفْن, which is a case, or receptacle, wherein<br>\
is the sword together with its scabbard (بِغِمْدِهِ)<br>\
and its suspensory belt or cord: (S, O, TA:) it<br>\
is like a جِرَاب of leather, into which the rider, or<br>\
rider upon a camel, puts his sword with its جَفْن<br>\
[here meaning scabbard], and his whip, and his<br>\
staff, or stick, and his utensils: (Az, TA:) or<br>\
like the جِرَاب, into which one puts his sword with<br>\
its scabbard (بِغِمْدِهِ), and his whip, and sometimes his travelling-provisions of dates &amp;c.:<br>\
(IAth, TA:) the pl. of the قِرَاب of the sword is<br>\
قُرُبٌ [a pl. of mult.] (Msb, TA) and أَقْرِبَةٌ [a<br>\
pl. of pauc.], like خُمُرٌ and أَخْمِرَةٌ pls. of خِمَارٌ.<br>\
(Msb.) See also قُرْبٌ, latter half.<br>\
قَرِيبٌ Near in respect of place: (S, O, Msb,<br>\
K, * &amp;c.:) in this sense used alike as sing. and<br>\
pl. (Kh, ISk, T, O, Msb, K *) and dual, (ISk,<br>\
TA,) and as masc. and fem., (AA, Kh, Fr, ISk,<br>\
T, S, O, Msb,) as is also بَعِيدٌ in the contr.<br>\
sense: (Kh, ISk, TA:) the Arabs say هُوَ قَرِيبٌ<br>\
مِنِّى, (ISk, O, * TA,) and هُمَا قَرِيبٌ مِنِّى, and هُمْ<br>\
قَرِيبٌ مِنِّى, (ISk, TA,) and هِىَ قَرِيبٌ مِنِّى, &amp;c.,<br>\
meaning فِى مَكَانٍ قَرِيبٍ [in a place near, to me,<br>\
or little removed from me:] (ISk, O, TA:) or<br>\
when you say هِنْدٌ قَرِيبٌ مِنْكَ, it is as though you<br>\
said هِنْدٌ مَوْضِعُهَا قَرِيبٌ مِنْكَ [Hind, her place is<br>\
near to thee:] (AA, Msb:) hence, [in the Kur<br>\
vii. 54,] إِنَّ رَحْمَةَ اللّٰهِ قَرِيبٌ مِنَ المُحْسِنِينَ<br>\
[Verily the mercy of God is near unto the welldoers]: (AA, ISk, O, Msb:) but it is allowable<br>\
to say قَرِيبَةٌ, as also بَعِيدَةٌ: (ISk, O, Msb, TA:)<br>\
or (accord. to Zj, TA) قريب is here without ة<br>\
because رحمة is not really [but only conventionally] of the fem. gender: (S, O, TA:) [but this<br>\
reason is not satisfactory, because it does not<br>\
apply to other cases mentioned above:] and it is<br>\
also said that it is without ة because it is assimilated to an epithet of the measure فَعُولٌ, which<br>\
does not receive the fem. affix ة. (TA.) [Hence<br>\
the phrase مِنْ قَرِيبٍ:] see قُرْبٌ, former half, in<br>\
two places. And [hence also] you say, إِنَّ قَرِيبًا<br>\
مِنْكَ زَيْدًا [Verily Zeyd is in a place near to<br>\
thee]; like as you say, إِنَّ قُرْبَكَ زَيْدًا. (Sb, TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Also Near in respect of time, whether future,<br>\
as in the Kur xlii. 16, &amp;c.; or past, as in the<br>\
Kur lix. 15. And hence قَرِيبًا meaning Shortly<br>\
after and before. And Nearly, as when one<br>\
says, أَقَمْتُ بِالمَوْضِعِ قَرِيبًا مِنْ سَنَةٍ I remained,<br>\
stayed, or abode, in the place nearly a year.<br>\
Hence also the phrase عَنْ قَرِيبٍ:] see قُرْبٌ, near<br>\
the middle. ―<br>\
-b3-  And Near as meaning related by<br>\
birth or by marriage: (S, O, Msb, K:) [and<br>\
generally used as an epithet in which the quality<br>\
of a subst. is predominant, meaning a relation,<br>\
or relative:] in this sense it receives the fem.<br>\
form, by universal consent; so that you say,<br>\
هٰذِهِ المَرْأَةُ قَرِيبَتِى [This woman is my relation]:<br>\
(Fr, S, O, Msb: *) and likewise the dual form;<br>\
so that you say, [هُمَا قَرِيبَانِ and] هُمَا قَرِيبَتَانِ<br>\
[They two are relations]: (AA, Msb:) [and it<br>\
has a pl., namely, أَقْرِبَآءُ;] you say, هُمْ أَقْرِبَائِى<br>\
and أَقَارِبِى (S, A, O, K) [and أَقْرَبِىَّ, this last<br>\
originally أَقْرَبُوىَ; the first signifying They are<br>\
my relations; and the second and third, properly, being pls. of ↓ أَقْرَبُ, They are my nearer, or<br>\
nearest, or very near, relations; though in the T<br>\
the second is said to be pl. of قَرِيبٌ; and in most<br>\

as it is also in the TA,) it is implied that<br>\
أَقْرِبَآءُ and أَقَارِبُ and أَقْرَبُونَ (which are mentioned<br>\
in the Msb without any distinction of meaning)<br>\
are all to be understood in the latter sense]: and<br>\
قُرْبٌ [also] is a pl. of قَرِيبٌ [app. in the sense<br>\
here assigned to it], like as غُرْبٌ is of غَرِيبٌ;<br>\
(TA in art. زلف;) and قَرْبَى is allowable as a pl.<br>\
of فَرِيبٌ: (T, TA:) the pl. of قَرِيبَةٌ is قَرَائِبُ.<br>\
(T, Msb, TA.) And like as you say, هُوَ قَرِيبِى<br>\

↓ هُوَ ذُو قَرَابَتِى (S, O, K) and مِنِّى ↓ ذُو قَرَابَةٍ and<br>\
منّى ↓ ذُو مَقْرُبَةٍ and مِنِّى ↓ ذُو قُرْبَى; (TA;) but<br>\
not ↓ هُوَ قَرَابَتِى; (K;) [for only] the vulgar say<br>\
this; as also هُمْ قَرَابَاتِى: (S, O:) or, accord. to<br>\
Z, ↓ هُوَ قَرَابَتِى is allowable, being accounted<br>\
for as a phrase in which the prefixed n. [ذُو] is<br>\
suppressed; and it has moreover been asserted<br>\
to be correct and chaste in verse and prose:<br>\
↓ قَرَابَةٌ also occurs in the trads. in the sense of<br>\
أَقَارِبُ: it is said in the Nh to be an inf. n. used<br>\
as an epithet, agreeably with general analogy:<br>\
and in the Tes-heel it is said to be a quasi-pl. n.<br>\
of قَرِيبٌ, like as صَحَابَةٌ is of صَاحِبٌ: (MF,<br>\
TA:) [accord. to Mtr,] ↓ قَرَابَةٌ is correctly applicable to one and to a pl. number, as being originally an inf. n.; so that one says, هُو قَرَابَتِى<br>\
and هُمْ قَرَابَتِى; though the chaste phrase is ذُو<br>\
قَرَابَتِى applied to one; and ذَوَا قَرَابَتِى, to two;<br>\
and ذَوُو قَرَابَتِى, to a pl. number. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And [it is also applied to relationship:] one says,<br>\
بَيْنَنَا نَسَبٌ قَرِيبٌ and ↓ قُرَابٌ [Between us is a near<br>\
relationship]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  It signifies also Near, or<br>\

قُرْبَانٌ, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b6-  And one says, مَا هُوَ بِعَالِمٍ<br>\
عَالِمٍ ↓ وَلَا قُرَابِ and عَالِمٍ ↓ قُرَابَةِ meaning قَرِيبِ عَالِمٍ<br>\
[i. e. He is not learned nor near learned]. (TA.)<br>\
And مِنْ ذٰلِكَ ↓ مَا هُوَ بِشَبِيهِكَ وَلَا بِقُرَابَةٍ meaning<br>\
وَلَا بِقَرِيبٍ مِنْ ذٰلِكَ [i. e. He is not the like of thee<br>\
