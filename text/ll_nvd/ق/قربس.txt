saddle of a horse, (IDrd, K,) which form its fore<br>\
part and its hinder part; [one answering to the<br>\
pommel of our saddle, and the other being the<br>\
troussequin;] together corresponding to the شَرْخَانِ<br>\
of the [camel&#39;s saddle called] رَحْل: in the قربوس<br>\

boards that form] the inner sides of the عضدان:<br>\
each قربوس has two legs (عضدان) and what<br>\
are termed ذِئْبَتَانِ: then come the دفّتان, which<br>\

the horse; and in the دفّتان are the عِرَاقَانِ,<br>\

fore part of the saddle and its hinder part:<br>\

people of Syria pronounce the word with tesh-deed, [قَرَّبُوس,] which is wrong; and make its<br>\
pl. قَرَبَابِيس, which is more wrong. (O.)<br>\
