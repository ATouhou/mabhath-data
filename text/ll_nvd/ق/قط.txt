قَطَّهُ, aor.<br>\
قَطُ3َ, (S, M,) inf. n. قَطٌّ, (M, K,) He cut<br>\
it, in a general sense: (M, K:) or he cut it, meaning<br>\
a hard thing, such as a حُقّة [or box], (Lth, M,<br>\
K,) and the like, (M,) in a good form, or fashion,<br>\
like as a man cuts a reed upon a bone; (Lth;)<br>\
and ↓ تَقْطِيطٌ, also, [inf. n. of قطّطهُ,] signifies the<br>\
cutting a حُقَّة, (K, TA,) and making it even:<br>\
(TA:) or قَطَّهُ signifies he cut it breadthwise,<br>\
across, or crosswise; (S, M, O, K;) he so separated it; (Kh, S;) opposed to قَدَّهُ, (S, TA,)<br>\
which signifies he cut it in halves lengthwise,<br>\
like as one cuts a strap or thong: (TA:) and<br>\
↓ اقتطّهُ signifies the same. (M, K. *) You say,<br>\
قَطَّ القَلَمَ, (S, Msb,) aor. as above, (K,) and so<br>\
the inf. n., (Msb,) He nibbed the reed for writing;<br>\
cut off its head breadthwise, across, or crosswise.<br>\
(S, * Msb.) And قَطَّ البَيْطَارُ حَافِرَ الدَّابَّةِ The farrier pared, and made even, the hoof of the beast<br>\
of carriage. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  قَططَ الشَّعَرُ, (S, M, K,)<br>\
with the reduplication made manifest, (S, M,)<br>\
and قَطَّ, aor. يَقَطُّ, (M, Msb, K,) and, of the latter,<br>\
يَقُطُّ also, [contr. to the general rule,] (Msb,)<br>\
inf. n., of the former, قَطٌّ, (M, TA,) which is<br>\
extr., (M,) and of the latter, (M, TA,) قَطَطٌ and<br>\
قَطَاطَةٌ, (M, K,) The hair was, or became,<br>\
[frizzled, or] very crisp, very curly, or much<br>\
twisted, and contracted: (S, * Msb:) or like that<br>\
of the زَنْجِىّ: (Msb:) or crisp, curly, or twisted,<br>\
and contracted, and short. (M, K.)<br>\
-A3-  قَطَّ السِّعْرُ,<br>\
(S, M, Msb, K,) aor. يَقِطُّ, (S, K,) with kesr, (S,<br>\
TA,) or يَقُطُّ, (M, Msb,) the verb being co-ordinate<br>\
to قَتَلَ, [contr. to the general rule,] (Msb) inf. n.<br>\
قَطٌّ (S, M, Msb, K) and قُطُوطٌ; (M, K;) as also<br>\
قُطَّ, with damm; (Fr, K;) The price was, or<br>\
became, dear, (S, M, Msb, K,) and high: (Msb:)<br>\
Sh thought this explanation to be wrong, and the<br>\
meaning to be the price flagged; but Az says,<br>\
that in this he was mistaken. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  قَطَّ اللّٰهُ<br>\
السِّعْرَ God made the price to be, or become, dear.<br>\

R. Q. 1<br>\
قَطْقَطَتِ السَّمَآءُ The sky let fall rain,<br>\
(AZ, S, M,) or hail, (M,) such as is termed<br>\
قِطْقِطٌ: (AZ, S, M:) or the sky rained. (K.)<br>\
قَطْ, signifying حَسْبُ, [explained in exs. here<br>\
following,] (Lth, S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K,) i. e.,<br>\
(S,) denoting the being satisfied, or content, (Sb,<br>\
S, M, Msb,) with a thing, (Msb,) is thus written,<br>\
with fet-h to the ق, and with the ط quiescent,<br>\
(Sb, S, M, Msb, * Mughnee,) like عَنْ; (K;)<br>\
and also, (Sb, M, K,) sometimes, (Sb, M,)<br>\
↓ قَطٍ, (Sb, M, K,) with tenween, mejroor; (K;)<br>\
and ↓ قَطِى [distinguished from قَطِى in the next<br>\
sentence]; (Sb, M, K;) but the term “ mejroor ”<br>\
is here used contr. to the rules of grammar, as it<br>\
denotes that قط is decl., whereas it is not.<br>\
(MF.) It is used as a prefixed noun: you say,<br>\
قَطْكَ هٰذَا الشَّىْءُ Thy sufficiency [meaning sufficient for thee] is this thing; syn. حَسْبُكَ; (Lth,<br>\
S, Mughnee; *) and like it is قَدْ: (Lth:) and you<br>\
also say, using it as a prefixed n., قَطْنِى My sufficiency; syn. حَسْبِى; (Lth, S, * Mughnee;) like<br>\
قَدْنِى; introducing ن, (Lth, S, TA,) as in<br>\
عَنِّى and مِنِّى and لَدُنِّى, contr. to rule, for the<br>\
reason which has been explained in treating of<br>\
قَدْ, (S, TA,) to preserve the original quiescence<br>\
of the ط; (Mughnee;) and قَطِى; (S, Msb,<br>\
Mughnee;) and ↓ قَطِ; (S;) and ↓ قَطَاطِ, (S, M,<br>\
K,) like قَطَامِ, (S, K,) indecl.; (M;) as signifying حَسْبِى: (S, M, Msb, Mughnee, K:) and, as<br>\
is said in the Moo&#39;ab, قَطْ عَبْدِ اللّٰهِ دِرْهَمٌ The sufficiency of &#39;Abd-Allah is a dirhem; [and the like<br>\
is said by Lth and in the Mughnee;] pausing<br>\
upon the ط, and making قط to govern a gen.<br>\
case [as it does virtually in the preceding instances]; and the Basrees say, that this is the<br>\
right mode, as meaning the like of حَسْبُ زَيْدٍ<br>\
دِرْهَمٌ and كَفْىَ زَيْدٍ دِرْهَمٌ: (K:) or some say قَطْ,<br>\
with jezm; and some say ↓ قَطُ, making it inded.<br>\
with damm for its termination; each governing<br>\
what follows it in the gen. case. (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is<br>\
also a verbal noun, signifying يَكْفِى [It suffices,<br>\
or will suffice; or it is, or will be, sufficient]; and<br>\
when this is the case, you say, قَطْنِى, (Mughnee,<br>\
K,) like as you say, يَكْفِينِى [It suffices me,<br>\
or will suffice me]; (Mughnee;) or كَفَانِى [which<br>\
means, emphatically, it suffices me], accord. to<br>\
the Koofees; (Lth;) which is also allowable<br>\
when قَطْ is equivalent to حَسْبُ [as we have observed above]: (Mughnee:) and you say also,<br>\
قَطْكَ, meaning كَفَاكَ [emphatically It suffices<br>\
thee]: and قَطِى, meaning كَفَانِى [emphatically<br>\
It suffices me]: (K:) so in the copies of the K;<br>\
[in the CK, erroneously, قَطَّنِى;] but [it seems<br>\
that it should be قَطْنِى; for] it is said in the<br>\
Mughnee and its Expositions, that in this last<br>\
case the addition of the ن is indispensable:<br>\
(MF:) and some say, قَطْ عَبْدَ اللّٰهِ دِرْهَمٌ [A<br>\
dirhem suffices, or will suffice, &#39;Abd-Allah (in<br>\
the CK, erroneously, قَطُّ)]; making it to<br>\
govern the accus. case [as it does virtually<br>\
in preceding instances]: and some add ن,<br>\
saying, عَبْدَ اللّٰهِ دِرْهَمٌ ↓ قَطْنُ [meaning the<br>\
same]: (Lth, K:) [hence,] some say, that [قَطْن<br>\
in] قَطْنِى is a word originally thus formed without any augmentation, like [حَسْب in] حَسْبِى;<br>\
(M;) [but J says,] if the ن in قَطْنِى belonged to<br>\
the root of the word, they had said قَطْنُكَ, which<br>\
is not known. (S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is also syn. with حَسْبُ in<br>\
the phrase مَا رَأَيْتُهُ إِلَّا مَرَّةً وَاحِدَةً فَقَطٌ [I have not<br>\
seen him, or it, save once, and that was a thing<br>\
sufficient or that was enough]: (S, Msb: *) or, as<br>\
is said in the Mutowwel, قَطْ in فَقَطْ is a verbal<br>\
noun, meaning abstain thou [from further questioning, or the like], as though it were the complement of a condition suppressed [such as “ the<br>\
case being so ”]: or, as is said in the Mesáïl of<br>\
Ibn-Es-Seed, the ف is properly prefixed because<br>\
the meaning is and I was satisfied, or content,<br>\
therewith; so that the ف is a conjunction: (from<br>\
a marginal note in a copy of the Mughnee:) [it<br>\
therefore virtually signifies and no more; or<br>\
only; and thus it may often be rendered: and<br>\
this explains what here follows:] when قَط is<br>\
used to denote paucity, (M, K,) which is said by<br>\
El-Hareeree, in the Durrah, to be only in negative phrases, (MF,) it is [written قَطْ,] with jezm,<br>\
(M, K,) and without teshdeed: (M:) you say,<br>\
مَا عِنْدَكَ إِلَّا هٰذَا قَطْ [which may be rendered Thou<br>\
hast not save this only]: but when it is followed<br>\
by a conjunctive ا, it is with kesr; [as in the saying,] مَا عَلِمْتُ إِلَّا هٰذَا قَطِ اليَوْمَ [virtually mean-<br>\
ing I knew not, or, emphatically, know not, save<br>\
this only, to-day]: (K:) and also, (K,) when<br>\
thus using it, (M,) you say, مَا لَهُ إِلَّا عَشَرَةٌ قَطْ<br>\
يَافَتَى [likewise virtually meaning He has not<br>\
save ten only, O young man], without teshdeed,<br>\
and with jezm; and ↓ قَطِّ, with teshdeed and<br>\
khafd; (Lh, M, K;) the kesreh of the latter, in<br>\
a case of this kind, being to distinguish the قَطّ<br>\
which denotes [paucity of] number from قَطُّ,<br>\
which denotes time. (Lth.)<br>\
-A2-  See also قَطُّ,<br>\
first sentence.<br>\
قُطْ: see قَطُّ.<br>\
قَطُ: see قَطْ:<br>\
-A2-  and see also قَطُّ.<br>\
قَطِ: see قَطْ.<br>\
قُطُ: see قَطُّ.<br>\
قَطٍ: see قَطْ.<br>\
قَطَّ: see قَطُّ.<br>\
قَطُّ is an adv. noun, (Mughnee,) [generally]<br>\
denoting time, (S, M, Mughnee,) or past time,<br>\
(Msb, K,) used to include all past time; (Lth,<br>\
Mughnee;) as also ↓ قُطُّ, (S, M, Mughnee, K,)<br>\
the former vowel being assimilated to the latter;<br>\
(S, Mughnee;) and ↓ قَطُ, (S, M, Mughnee, K,)<br>\
and ↓ قُطُ; (S, Mughnee, * K;) and some say<br>\
↓ قَطْ, (S, Mughnee,) whence قَطُ is formed, by<br>\
making its termination similar to that of the primary form قَطُّ, to show its origin; (S, M;) or<br>\
this would be better than قَطُ; (M;) and ↓ قُطْ,<br>\
(S, M, Mughnee, *) like مُذْ, which is rare: (S,<br>\
M:) of all these, the first is the most chaste:<br>\
(Mughnee:) when time is meant by it, it is<br>\
always with refa, without tenween: (K:) or one<br>\
says also ↓ قَطِّ, (M, Mughnee, K,) with kesr and<br>\
teshdeed to the ط, (M, K,) accord. to IAar;<br>\
(M;) and ↓ قَطَّ, with fet-h and teshdeed to the<br>\
ط; (M, * K;) as well as with damm to the ط<br>\
without teshdeed. (K [in some copies of which<br>\
is here added, “and with refa to the ط; ” to<br>\
which is further added in the CK, “without<br>\
teshdeed: ” but I find two copies without any<br>\
addition of this redundant kind: for by “ refa ” is<br>\
here meant, as in a former instance, “damm; ”<br>\
though improperly, as the word is indecl.]) You<br>\
say, مَا رَأَيْتُهُ قَطُّ &amp;c. [I have not seen him, or it,<br>\
ever, or hitherto]; (S, M, K;) and مَا فَعَلْتُهُ قَطَّ<br>\
[I have not done it ever, or hitherto]; (Msb,<br>\
Mughnee;) i. e., in the time that is past; (Msb,<br>\
K;) or in what has been cut off of my life;<br>\
(Mughnee, K;) its derivation being from قَطَطْتُ<br>\
meaning “ I cut; ” for the past is cut off from the<br>\
present and the future; and it is indecl. because<br>\
it implies the meaning of مُذْ and إِلَى; its meaning being مُذْ أَنْ خُلِقْتُ إِلَى الآنَ [since my being<br>\
created until now]; and with a vowel for its termination to prevent the occurrence of two quiescent letters together; (Mughnee;) and it is with<br>\
refa [meaning damm for its termination] because<br>\
it is like قَبْلُ and بَعْدُ: (Lth:) accord. to Ks,<br>\
(S,) قَطُّ is a contraction of قَطَطُ: (S, M:) Sb<br>\
says, that it denotes الإِنْتِهَآء; [app. meaning that<br>\
it signifies abstain thou from further questioning,<br>\
or the like; for El-Hareeree says, in the Durrah,<br>\
that قَطُّ and قَطْ both signify the same as حَسْبُ;]<br>\
and that it is indecl., with damm for its termination, like حَسْبُ. (M.) You say also, مَا فَعَلْتُ<br>\
هٰذَا قَطْ وَلَا قَطُّ [app. meaning I have not done this<br>\
alone, nor ever]: (K, TA: [in the CK قَطُّ ولا قُطُ,<br>\
but]) the former قط is with jezm to the ط, and<br>\
the latter is with teshdeed and damm to the ط.<br>\
(TA.) And يَا فَتَى ↓ مَا زَالَ عَلَى هٰذَا مُذْ قُطَّ<br>\
[He, or it, has not ceased to be after this manner<br>\
during all past time, O young man]; with damm<br>\
to the ق, and with teshdeed. (Lh, M.) It is<br>\
used only in negative phrases relating to past<br>\
time; the saying of the vulgar لَا أَفْعَلُهُ قَطُّ [meaning I will not do it ever] being incorrect; (Mughnee, K; [in the CK قَطُ]) for with respect to the<br>\
future you say عَوْضُ (TA) [or أَبَدًا]: or it is<br>\
mostly so used, accord. to Ibn-Málik: (MF:)<br>\
but it occurs after an affirmative phrase in places<br>\
in El-Bukháree, (K,) in his Saheeh; (TA;) for<br>\
ex., أَطْوَلُ صَلَاةٍ صَلَّيْتُهَا قَطُّ [The longest prayer<br>\
which I have prayed ever]: and in the Sunan of<br>\
Aboo-Dawood; تَوَضَّأَ ثَلَاثًا قَطُّ [He performed the<br>\
وُضُوْء three times ever]: and Ibn-Málik asserts it<br>\
to be right, and says that it is one of the things<br>\
which have been unperceived by many of the<br>\
grammarians: (K:) El-Karmánee, however, interprets these instances as though they were<br>\
negative. (TA.)<br>\
قَطِّ: see قَطْ, near the end of the paragraph:<br>\
-A2-  and see also قَطُّ, in the first sentence.<br>\
قُطُّ: see قَطُّ, in two places.<br>\
شَعَرٌ قَطٌّ, and ↓ قَطَطٌ, (M, Msb, K,) and ↓ قَطِطٌ,<br>\
(TA,) Crisp, curly, or twisted and contracted,<br>\
and short, hair: (M, K:) or hair that is<br>\
very crisp, very curly, or much twisted and<br>\
contracted: or, accord. to the T, ↓ قَطَطٌ means<br>\
hair of the زَنْجِىّ: (Msb:) or you say,<br>\
↓ جَعْدٌ قَطَطٌ, meaning very crisp, very curly, or<br>\
much twisted and contracted. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  رَجُلٌ قَطٌّ,<br>\
and ↓ قَطَطٌ, (Msb,) or رَجُلٌ قَطُّ الشَّعَرِ, and ↓ قَطَطُ<br>\
الشَّعَرِ, (S, M, K,) A man whose hair is crisp,<br>\
curly, or twisted and contracted, and short: (M,<br>\
K:) or whose hair is very crisp, very curly, or<br>\
much twisted and contracted; (S, * Msb;) as also<br>\
↓ قِطَاطٌ: (K: accord. to some copies; but<br>\
accord. to other copies, as a pl. in this sense:<br>\
[the reading of the latter is more probably correct, and is that of the TA:]) or beautifully<br>\
crisp or curly or twisted and contracted: (TA:)<br>\
the pl. [of قَطٌّ] is أَقْطَاطٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and قَطُّونَ<br>\
and قِطَاطٌ; and [of ↓ قَطَطٌ] قَطَطُونَ: (M, K:) the<br>\
epithet applied to a woman is قَطَّةٌ, and ↓ قَطَطٌ<br>\
without ة. (M, Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  See also ↓ قَاطٌّ.<br>\
قِطٌّ A slice cut off (شَقِيقَةٌ), of a melon or other<br>\
thing. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (tropical:)  A portion, share, or lot,<br>\
(M, A, Msb, K,) of gifts, (A, TA,) &amp;c. (TA.)<br>\
Hence the saying in the Kur, [xxxviii. 15,]<br>\
رَبَّنَا عَجِّلْ لَنَا قِطَّنَا قَبْلَ يَوْمِ الحِسَابِ (tropical:)  [O our Lord,<br>\
hasten to us our portion before the day of reckoning]: accord. to some, our portion of punishment: but accord. to Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Jubeyr, it<br>\
means, of Paradise. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  (assumed tropical:)  A writing;<br>\
(Fr, S, Msb;) [such as that of a man&#39;s works;]<br>\
and hence, accord. to Fr, the words of the Kur<br>\
cited above; those words being said in derision:<br>\
(TA:) or a writing of reckoning: (M, K:) or a<br>\
written obligation: (M:) or it signifies also a<br>\
written obligation binding one to give a gift or<br>\
present; (S, K, TA;) and hence the saying in<br>\
the Kur cited above: (S:) pl. قُطُوطٌ: (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K:) which Az explains as meaning gifts,<br>\
and stipends; so called because they were issued<br>\
written in the form of notes and statements of<br>\
obligation upon cut pieces of paper or the like.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  (assumed tropical:)  An hour, or a portion, (سَاعَة,) of the<br>\
night. (M, K.) You say مَضَى قِطٌّ مِنَ اللَّيْلِ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [An hour, or a portion, of the night passed].<br>\
(Th, M.)<br>\
-A2-  A male cat: (S, M, Msb, K:) the<br>\
female is called قِطَّةٌ: (Lth, S, M, Msb:) Kr<br>\
disallowed this latter; and IDrd says, I do not<br>\
think it to be genuine Arabic; (M;) but to this<br>\
it is objected that it occurs in traditions: (MF:)<br>\
the pl. is قِطَاطٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and قِطَطَةٌ, (M,<br>\
K,) or قِطَطٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
