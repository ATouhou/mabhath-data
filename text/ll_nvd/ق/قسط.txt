(Mgh, Msb, K,) He declined, or deviated, from<br>\
the right course; acted unjustly, wrongfully, injuriously, or tyrannically. (S, M, Mgh, Msb,<br>\

قسّطهُ, (IAar, M, TA,) inf. n. تَقْسِيطٌ,<br>\
(IAar, TA,) He distributed it; or dispersed it.<br>\
(IAar, M, TA.) It is implied in the K that the<br>\
verb in this sense is ↓ قَسَطَ, of three letters [only,<br>\
without teshdeed]. (TA.) You say, قسّط المَالَ<br>\
بِيْنَهُمْ He distributed the property among them.<br>\
(TA.) And قسّط الخَرَاجَ عَلَيْهِمْ He assigned the<br>\
several portions which each one of them should<br>\
pay of the [tax called] خراج: (TA:) or قسّط<br>\
الخَرَاجَ, inf. n. as above, signifies he assessed, or<br>\
apportioned, the خراج (Mgh, Msb) with equity<br>\
and equality, (Mgh,) to be paid at certain times.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  قسّط عَلَى عِيَالِهِ النَّفَقَةَ, (TA,) inf. n. as<br>\

اقسط, (S, M, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. إِقْسَاطٌ,<br>\
(Mgh, K,) He acted equitably, or justly, (S, M,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K,) in his judgment or the like;<br>\
(M, TA;) as also, (Msb, K,) accord. to IKtt,<br>\
(Msb,) ↓ قَسَطَ, aor.<br>\
قَسِطَ (Msb, K) and<br>\
قَسُطَ, (K,) but<br>\
the former of these aors., as well as the former<br>\
verb, is the more known, (TA,) inf. n. قَسْطٌ,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) or قِسْطٌ [q. v. infra]; (M, K;) or<br>\
إِقْسَاطٌ is only in division: (TA:) thus the latter<br>\
of these two verbs is made to have two contr.<br>\
significations: (Msb, TA:) in the former of<br>\
them, accord. to some, the أ has a privative effect,<br>\
[so that the verb properly signifies he did away<br>\
with, or put away, injustice, or the like,] as [it<br>\
has in اشكاه] in the phrase شَكَى إِليَسْهِ فَأَشْكَاهُ<br>\
[he complained to him and he made his complaint to cease]. (TA.) It is said in the Kur,<br>\
[iv. 3,] وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ أَلَّا تُقْسِطُوا فِى اليَتَامَى [And if<br>\
ye fear lest ye should not act equitably with<br>\
respect to the orphans]: (Mgh:) or, accord. to<br>\
one reading, ↓ تَقْسُطُوا, with damm to the س.<br>\
(TA.) And you say also, أَقْسَطْتُ بَيْنَهُمْ [I acted<br>\
equitably between them], and إِلَيْهِمْ [towards<br>\
them]. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَقَسَّطُوا الشَّىْءِ بَيْنَهُمْ They divided the thing<br>\
among themselves (Lth, S, * M [in which last بينهم<br>\
is omitted] and O, L, K) equitably, (M, O,) or<br>\
equitably and equally, (L,) or with equality.<br>\
(Lth, K.) You say also, المَالَ بَيْنَهُمْ ↓ إِقْتَسَطُوا<br>\
They divided the property among themselves;<br>\
(TK;) إِقْتِسَاطٌ being syn. with إِقْتِسَامٌ. (K.)<br>\

which is brought from India, and which is put<br>\
into the substances used for fumigating, and into<br>\
medicine: (Lth:) or a certain drug of the sea:<br>\
(S:) [it is said in the S and TA, voce حِنْزَابٌ, that<br>\
the carrot of the (جَزَرُ البَحْرِ) is called قُسْطٌ:] in a<br>\
trad., القُسْطُ البَحْرِىُّ [or قُسْط of the sea] is<br>\
mentioned as one of the best of remedies: and in<br>\
another trad., قُسْط is coupled by the conjunction<br>\
و with أَظْفَار, or, accord. to one relation thereof,<br>\
is prefixed to the latter word, governing it in<br>\
the gen. case: and IAth says, that it is a sort of<br>\
perfume: but some say that it is aloes-wood<br>\
(عُود, q. v.): [see also ظَفَارِىٌّ:] and others, a<br>\
well-known drug, of sweet odour, with which<br>\
women and infants are fumigated: (TA:) it is<br>\
diuretic, beneficial to the liver in a high degree,<br>\
and for the colic, and for worms, and the quartan<br>\
fever, as a beverage; and for rheum, and<br>\
defluxions, and pestilence, when the patient is<br>\
fumigated therewith; and for the [leprous-like<br>\
disorder called] بَهَق, and the [discolouration of the<br>\
face termed] كَلَف, when applied as a liniment;<br>\
(K;) and it confines the bowels, expels wind,<br>\

pleasurable sensation, is an ingredient in many<br>\
sorts of perfume, and is the best of perfumes in<br>\
odour when one fumigates therewith. (TA.)<br>\

its syn. عَدْلٌ; (M, K;) and [therefore] applied<br>\
alike to a sing. n. [and to a dual] and to a pl.:<br>\

eighty-one dirhems. (TA.) Sometimes it is used<br>\
for performing the ablution termed وُضُوْء: and<br>\
