قَبَضَهُ, (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb,) or قَبَضَهُ بِيَدِهِ, (O,<br>\
K,) aor.<br>\
قَبِضَ, (A, Msb, K,) inf. n. قَبْضٌ, (S, Msb,)<br>\
He took it with his hand, (A, O, K,) by actual<br>\
touch, or feel: (O:) or the former signifies he<br>\
closed his hand upon it: (Lth:) [he grasped it;<br>\
griped it; clutched it; seized it:] or he took<br>\
it with the whole of his hand: (Bd, xx. 96:) or<br>\
i. q. أَجَذَهُ [he took it in any manner: he took it<br>\
with his hand: he took possession of it: and he<br>\
received it]: (S, M, Mgh, Msb:) and قَبَضَ عَلَيْهِ,<br>\
and بِهِ, (M,) or قَبَضَ عَلَيْهِ بِيَدَهِ, (A, Mgh, Msb,<br>\

(أَنْحَى عَلَيْهِ) with the whole of his hand: (M:)<br>\
or he closed, or contracted, his fingers upon it:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) it is also said, by MF, that<br>\
some assert قَبْضٌ to signify the “ taking with the<br>\
ends of the fingers; ” but this is a mistranscription, for قَبْضٌ, with the unpointed ص. (TA<br>\
[in which it is said, in another place in this art.,<br>\
that ↓ تَقْبِيضٌ has also this last signification; but<br>\
this is evidently, in like manner, a mistranscription, for تَقْبِيضٌ.]) You say, قَبَضَ المَتَاعَ<br>\
[He took, or received, the commodity, or the commodities, or goods]. (A.) And قَبَضَ مِنْهُ الدَّيْنَ<br>\
[He took, or received, from him the debt]. (M,<br>\
K, in art. قضى; &amp;c.). And it is said in the<br>\
Kur, [xx. 96,] فَقَبَضْتُ قَبْضَةً مِنْ أَثَرِ الرَّسُولِ, (M,)<br>\
and, accord. to an extraordinary reading, ↓ قَبِيضَةً,<br>\
(B,) meaning [And I took a handful] of the dust<br>\
from the footstep of the hoof of the horse of<br>\
the messenger [Gabriel]: (IJ, M:) and ↓ إِقْتَبَضَ<br>\
مِنْ أَتَرِهِ قَبْضَةً signifies the same as قَبَضَ: and<br>\
قَبَصَ [q. v.] is [said to be] a dial. form thereof.<br>\
(TA.) And you say, قَبَضَ الطَّائِرَ He collected,<br>\
or comprehended, the bird in his grasp. (A.)<br>\
And قَبَضَ عَلَى عُرْفِ الفَرَسِ [He grasped, or laid<br>\
hold upon, the mane of the horse]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It is<br>\
also used metaphorically, to denote the having<br>\
an absolute property in a thing, to dispose of it<br>\
at pleasure, without respect to the hand; as in<br>\
the phrase قَبَضْتُ الأَرْضَ, and الدَّارَ, (tropical:)  I had, or<br>\
took, or got, possession of the land, and of the<br>\
house. (TA.) And [in like manner] it is said<br>\
in a trad., يَقْبِضُ اللّٰهُ الأَرْضَ, and السَّمَآءَ, (assumed tropical:)  God<br>\
will comprehend, or collect together, [within his<br>\
sole possession, (see قُبْضَةٌ,)] the earth, and the<br>\

And قُبِضَ (tropical:)  He (a man, S, M, A) died: (S M,<br>\
A, * K:) and also (assumed tropical:)  he (a sick man) was at the<br>\

taken; in the agony of death. (L, TA.) And<br>\
قَبَضْتُهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  I removed him from the thing,<br>\
or affair. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  قَبَضَهُ, aor. as above, (M,<br>\
K,) and so the inf. n., (S, M, Mgh,) also signifies<br>\
the (assumed tropical:)  contr. of بَسَطَهُ; (S, * M, Mgh, * K;) and so<br>\
↓ قبّضهُ, (IAar, M,) inf. n. تَقْبِيضٌ. (TA.) [As<br>\
such, (assumed tropical:)  He contracted it; or drew it together.]<br>\
You say, قَبَضَ رِجْلَهُ وَبَسَطَهَا (tropical:)  [He contracted his<br>\
leg, and extended it]. (A.) And قَبَضَ كَفَّهُ [He<br>\
clenched his hand]. (S, Mgh, Msb, K, in art.<br>\
برجم.). And قَبَضَ يَدَهُ عَنْهُ (assumed tropical:)  [He drew in his<br>\
hand from it: or] he refrained from laying hold<br>\
upon it. (K.) Whence the saying in the Kur,<br>\
[ix. 68,] وَيَقْبِضُونَ أَيْدِيَهُمْ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [And they<br>\
draw in their hands, or refrain,] from expenditure, or from paying the [poor-rate called] زَكَاة.<br>\
(TA.) You say also, جَنَاحَهُ ↓ قبّض (assumed tropical:)  He (a bird)<br>\
contracted his wing: (M:) or قَبَضَ, or قَبَضَ<br>\
جَنَاحَهُ, (assumed tropical:)  he contracted his wing to fly. (TA.)<br>\
And hence, (TA,) قَبَضَ, aor. as above; (S, K;)<br>\
or قَبُضَ (M;) [or both;] inf. n. [of the former]<br>\
قَبْضٌ (S, K,) and [of the latter, as indicated in<br>\
the M,] قَبَاضَةٌ (S, M, A, K) and قَبَاضٌ; (M;)<br>\
(tropical:)  He (a bird, S, K, and a horse, A, and a man,<br>\

K,) in flight, or in going or pace. (K.) يَقْبِضْنَ,<br>\
said of birds, in the Kur, [lxvii. 19,] is [said to<br>\
be] an ex. of this signification. (S, K. *) You<br>\
say also, قَبَضَتِ الإِبِلُ (tropical:)  The camels were quick in<br>\
their pace; at every spring therein, putting their<br>\
legs together. (A.) And ↓ إِنْقَبَضَ (tropical:)  He, or it, (a<br>\

حَاجَتِهِ (tropical:)  Such a one was quick, and light, or<br>\
active, in accomplishing his want. (A.) And<br>\
قَبْضٌ also signifies i. q. نَزْوٌ (assumed tropical:)  [The act of leaping,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Also, as contr. of بَسَطَهُ,] (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
collected it together. (Az.) And hence, (Az,)<br>\
قَبَضَ الإِبِلَ, (Az, M,) aor.<br>\
قَبِضَ, inf. n. قَبْضٌ (Az, S,<br>\
M) (assumed tropical:)  He drove (Az, S, M) the camels violently,<br>\
or roughly, (Az, M.) or quickly: (S:) because<br>\
the driver collects them together, when he<br>\
desires to drive them; for when they disperse<br>\
themselves from him, the driving of them is<br>\
difficult: (Az, TA:) and بِهَا ↓ إِنْقَبَضَ [signifies the<br>\
same, or, agreeably with an explanation given<br>\
above, (tropical:)  he went quickly with them]. (M.) And<br>\
العَيْرُ يَقْبِضُ عَانَتَهُ (assumed tropical:)  The he-ass drives away his she-ass. (M.) ―<br>\

contracted it, shrank it, or wrinkled it. (S, M,<br>\

النَّارُ الجِلْدَةَ (tropical:)  [The fire contracted, shrank, or<br>\

مَا بَيْنِ عَيْنَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  He contracted, or wrinkled, the<br>\

مَا بَيْنَ العَيْنَيْنِ (assumed tropical:)  [A day that contracts, or<br>\
wrinkles, the part between the eyes]; a metonymical phrase, denoting vehemence of fear, or of<br>\
war. (M, TA. *) And in like manner you say,<br>\
الحَشَى ↓ يَوْمٌ يُقَبِّضُ (assumed tropical:)  [A day that contracts the<br>\
bowels]. (M.) [And hence قَبَضَ, aor. and inf. n.<br>\
as first mentioned, (assumed tropical:)  It (a medicine, or food, &amp;c.,)<br>\
astringed, or constipated. And (assumed tropical:)  It (food) was<br>\

plentiful, the same, (Bd, Msb, Jel, TA,) to<br>\
some, (Bd, TA,) or to whom He will. (Jel.)<br>\
―<br>\

You say, فُلَانٌ يَبْسُطُ غَبِيدَهُ ثُمَّ يَقْبِضُهُمْ (tropical:)  [Such a<br>\

their liberty]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b8-  [As such also, (tropical:)  He, or<br>\
it, contracted his heart; i. e. distressed him;<br>\
grieved him.] You say, إِنَّهُ يَقْبِضُنِى مَا يَقْبِضُكَ<br>\
وَيَبْسُطُنِى مَا يَبْسُطُكَ (tropical:)  Verily what distresses thee,<br>\
or grieves thee, distresses, or grieves, me; and what<br>\
rejoices thee rejoices me]. (A.) [And it is related<br>\

يَقْبِضُنِى مَا قَبَضَهَا وَيَبْسُطُنِى مَا بَسَطَهاَ (tropical:)  [Fátimeh is<br>\
as though she were a part of me: what hath distressed her, or grieved her, distresses, or grieves,<br>\
me; and what hath rejoiced her rejoices me].<br>\
(TA.) Or the phrase إِنَّهُ لَيَقْبِضُنِى مَا قَبَضَكَ,<br>\
mentioned by Lth, means (assumed tropical:)  Verily what hath<br>\
annoyed and angered thee annoys and angers<br>\
me. (Az, TA.) قَبْضٌ and بَسْطٌ are terms applied<br>\
by the investigators of truth among the Soofees<br>\
to two contrary states of the heart, from both of<br>\
which it is seldom or never free: the former<br>\
being an affection of the heart withholding it from<br>\
dilatation and joy; whether the cause thereof be<br>\
known, as the remembrance of a sin or an offence,<br>\
or of an omission, or be not known; and some of<br>\
them make other divisions thereof. (TA.) [In like<br>\
manner] you say also, عَنَّا فَمَا قَبَضَكَ ↓ اِنْقَبَضْتُ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Thou shrankest from us: and what made thee<br>\
to shrink?]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b9-  [As such also, (tropical:)  He, or it,<br>\

You say, الخَيْرُ يَقْبِضُهُ وَالشَّرُّ يَبْسُطُهُ (tropical:)  [Wealth<br>\
