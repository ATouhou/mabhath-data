قَهْقَرَ, (K, TA,) inf. n. قَهْقَرَةٌ, (TA,) He<br>\
(a man) returned by the way by which he had<br>\
come: (TA:) or i. q. رَجَعَ القَهْقَرى, (K,) i. e.,<br>\
[he returned backwards; or] he retired, going<br>\
backwards, without turning his face towards the<br>\
direction in which he went; (TA;) as also ↓ تَقَهْقَرَ.<br>\
(K, TA.) Some hold, [contr. to the general<br>\
opinion,] that this verb belongs to art. قهر.<br>\

قَهْقَرَى A returning backwards; (S, K;) a<br>\
retiring, going backwards, without turning the<br>\
face towards the direction in which one goes:<br>\
(TA:) the dual is قَهْقَرَانِ; (IAmb, K;) like as<br>\
the dual of خَوْزَلَى is خَوْزَلَانِ; (TA;) without<br>\
ى, (K,) because this letter is deemed difficult to<br>\
pronounce with the ا and the ى of the dual.<br>\
(TA.) When you say رَجَعْتُ القَهْقَرَى [I returned<br>\
backwards; &amp;c.], it is as though you said I<br>\
returned with the returning which is known by<br>\
this name; for القهقرى is a mode of returning.<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَشَى القَهْقَرَى He reverted from the state<br>\
in which he was, or from the course which he<br>\
was following; revolted; apostatized. (Az, from<br>\
a trad.)<br>\
