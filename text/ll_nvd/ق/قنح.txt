قَنَحَهُ, (S, K, TA,) aor.<br>\
قَنَحَ, (K, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
قَنْحٌ, (S, TA,) He bent it, or curved it, (S, K,<br>\
TA,) i. e. a thing, (S,) or a stick, or branch,<br>\
(TA,) [at the end,] like a مِحْجَن, (S, K, TA,)<br>\
or صَوْلَجَان. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And قَنَحَ البَابَ He hewed,<br>\
or cut out, a wooden implement, (called a قُنَّاحَة<br>\
[q. v.], L,) and with it raised [and opened] the<br>\
door; as also ↓ اقنحهُ: (T, L, K, TA:) or [simply]<br>\
he raised [and opened] the door with the wooden<br>\
implement called a قُنَّاحَة; and so ↓ قنّحهُ: (A:)<br>\
[or] البالبَ ↓ قنّح, (S, K,) inf. n. تَقْنِيحٌ, (K,) He<br>\
adjusted (أَصْلَحَ) a قُنَّاحَة to the door. (S, K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
And قَنَحَ, (K, TA,) aor. and inf. n. as above,<br>\
(TA,) said of one drinking, He satisfied his thirst,<br>\
and, by reason thereof, raised his head; and<br>\
showed, or expressed, dislike of drinking (تَكَارَهَ عَلَى<br>\
الشُّرْبِ); like ↓ تقنّح; (K, TA;) which is the<br>\
more approved [and to which, as well as to the<br>\
former verb, both of the clauses of the explanation above relate, as will be shown by what<br>\
follows]: in some of the copies [of the K] like<br>\
↓ قنّح: accord. to AHn, one says, قَنَحَ مِنَ الشَّرَابِ,<br>\
aor. and inf. n. as above, meaning he sipped [of<br>\
the wine or beverage]; and accord. to Az, ↓ تَقَنَّحْتُ<br>\
مِنَ الشَّرَابِ, which, he says, is the prevailing expression: hence the saying of Umm-Zara, أَشْرَبُ<br>\
↓ فَأَتَقَنَّحُ, i. e. I [drink, and] stop, or interrupt,<br>\
drinking, and proceed leisurely therein: or, I<br>\
drink after the satisfying of thirst: which latter<br>\
explanation, mentioned on the authority of AZ,<br>\
is that which is approved by Sh and Az, in<br>\
opposition to Aboo-&#39;Abd-Allah Et-Tuwál, who<br>\
thought it to mean I drink by little and little.<br>\
(TA. [See also this saying of Umm-Zara, with<br>\
another reading of it, in the last sentence but one<br>\
of art. قمح.])<br>\

قَنَّحَ see above, second sentence, in two places:<br>\
-A2-  and see also the third sentence.<br>\

أَقْنَحَ see 1, second sentence.<br>\
5<br>\
تَقَنَّحَ see 1, third sentence, in three places.<br>\
قِنْحٌ [thus accord. to the L] is expl. in the &#39;Eyn<br>\
as meaning Thy making a قُنَّاحَة with which thou<br>\
wilt fasten (تَشُدُّ) the side-post of thy door and the<br>\
like; termed by the Persians قانه [app. a mistranscription for فَانَهٌ, a wooden peg, which,<br>\
dropping into the bolt of a lock, or the like, prevents its being opened until the said peg is pulled<br>\
up]; but ISd says, I know not how this is, for<br>\
the explanation is not good; and I think قِنْحٌ<br>\
here is a dial. var. of قُنَّاحٌ [q. v.]. (L.)<br>\
قَنَّاحٌ and ↓ قَنَّاحَةٌ [thus in the L, but app. the ق<br>\
should be with damm in both words,] A stick, or<br>\
branch, bent, or curved, [at the end,] like a<br>\
صَوْلَجَان [q. v.]. (L.)<br>\
قُنَّاحٌ A bar (مِتْرَس [or مَتَرْس]) of a door.<br>\
(IAar, L.)<br>\
قَنَّاحَةٌ: see قَنَّاحٌ.<br>\
قُنَّاحَةٌ A crooked, or curved, long مِفْتَاح [or<br>\
instrument for opening a door]: (S, L, K:) [from<br>\
what here follows, it seems to be a kind of wooden<br>\
lever, with a crooked, or curved, end, with which<br>\
a door is raised and opened: (see also 1:)] a<br>\
wooden implement with which a door is raised<br>\
[and opened, app. by lifting the lower pivot (which<br>\
serves as a hinge) out of its socket]: (A, L:) and<br>\
any piece of wood that is inserted beneath another<br>\
[as a lever] in order to move it. (L.)<br>\
