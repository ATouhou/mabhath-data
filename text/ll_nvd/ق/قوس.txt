قَاسَ الشَّىْءَ بِغَيْرهِ, and عَلَى غَيْرِهِ, aor. يَقُوسُهُ,<br>\

it; [both in the proper sense and mentally; but<br>\
the latter verb is the more common, though the<br>\
former, accord. to the JK, is the original;] (S,<br>\
TA;) and so الشَّىْءَ بِغَيْرِهِ ↓ اقتاس: (S, K: *) but<br>\
you should not say ↓ أَقَسْتُهُ for قُسْتُهُ or قِسْتُهُ. (S.)<br>\

تقوّس It (a thing) became bowed, or bent;<br>\

قَوْسٌ [A bow;] a certain thing, well known,<br>\
(A, K,) with which one shoots: (M, TA:) of the<br>\
fem. gender: (IAmb, M, Msb:) or masc. and<br>\
fem.: (S, Msb:) or sometimes masc.: (A, K:)<br>\
pl. [of pauc.] أَقْوَاسٌ (IAmb, S, A, Msb, K) and<br>\
أَقْيَاسٌ, (TA, and so in some copies of the<br>\
K, in the place of the former,) the ى being<br>\
interchangeable with the و, (TA,) and [of<br>\
mult.] قِسِىٌّ, (S, A, Msb, K,) originally قُوُوسٌ,<br>\
(S, TA,) which is not used, (TA,) of the<br>\
neasure فُعُولٌ, (S, Msb,) first changed to قُسُوٌّ, of<br>\
he measure فُلُوعٌ, and then to قِسِىٌّ, of the<br>\
measure فِلِيعٌ, like عِصِىٌّ, (S,) and قُسِىٌّ, (Fr,<br>\
Sgh, K,) from the same original, (TA,) [like<br>\
عُصِىٌّ,] and قِيَاسٌ, (IAmb, S, A, Msb, K,) which<br>\
is more agreeable with analogy than قسىّ.<br>\
(TA.) The dim. is قُوَيْسٌ, (IAmb, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
without ة, contr. to rule, as the word is fem.,<br>\
(M, TA,) and قُوَيْسَةٌ, (IAmb, Msb, K,) sometimes: (IAmb, Msb:) or the former accord. to<br>\
those who make قوس to be masc., (S,) and the<br>\
latter accord. to those who make it to be fem.<br>\
(S, Msb.) It is prefixed to another word to<br>\
give it a special signification. Thus you say,<br>\
قَوْسُ نَبْلٍ An Arabian bow. And قَوْسُ نُشَّابٍ A<br>\
Persian bow. And قَوْسُ حُسْبَانٍ [A bow for<br>\
shooting a certain kind of short arrows]. And<br>\
قَوْسُ جُلَاهِقٍ [A cross-bow]. And قَوْسُ نَدْفٍ [A<br>\
bow for loosening and separating cotton]. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence the saying,] فُلَانٌ لَا يَمُدُّ قَوْسَهُ أَحَدٌ<br>\
[Such a one, no one will pull his bow;] i. e., (tropical:)  no<br>\
one will vie with him, or compete with him. (A,<br>\
TA.) And رَمَوْنَا عَنْ قَوْسٍ وَاحِدٍ, (A, TA,) or<br>\
وَاحِدَةٍ, (Mgh,) [lit., They shot at us from one<br>\
bow: meaning, (tropical:)  they were unanimous against<br>\
us;] a proverb denoting agreement. (Mgh.)<br>\
[In the Msb, رَمَوْهُمْ and وَاحِدَةٍ.] And هُوَ مِنْ<br>\
خَيْرِ قُوَيْسٍ سَهْمًا; (S, L, K; except that in the L<br>\
and K, for قويس, we find قَوْسٍ;) (tropical:)  [He is of the<br>\
best of a little bow, as an arrow; i. e., he is one<br>\
of the best arrows of a little bow;] or صَارَ خَيْرَ<br>\
قُوَيْسٍ سَهْمًا (A, K) (tropical:)  [He became the best of a<br>\
little bow, as an arrow; i. e., he became the best<br>\
arrow of a little bow:] a proverb [See Arab.<br>\
Prov. i. 718] applied to him who has become<br>\
mighty after being of mean condition: (A:) or<br>\
to him who opposeth thee and then returns to<br>\
doing what thou likest. (A, K.) [Hence also<br>\
the phrase in the Kur, liii. 9,] فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ<br>\
And he was at the distance of two Arabian bows:<br>\
or two cubits [this is app. an explanation by one<br>\
who holds قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ to be for قَابَىَ قَوْسٍ:] (K:)<br>\
or the meaning is, قَابَىْ قَوْسٍ, i. e., [at the<br>\
distance of the measure of] the two portions<br>\
between the part of a bow that is grasped by the<br>\
hand and each of the curved extremities. (TA.)<br>\
See also art. قوب. ―<br>\
-b3-  القَوْسُ (assumed tropical:)  [The Sign of<br>\
Sagittarius; also called الرَّامِى;] one of the signs<br>\
of the zodiac; (S, K;) namely, the ninth thereof. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  قَوْسُ قُزَحَ The rainbow: the two words<br>\
are inseparable. (TA.) See قزح. ―<br>\

thereof, like a bow: (A:) or, accord. to Zeyd<br>\
Ibn-Kuthweh, the fourth part of the جُلَّة, of<br>\
dates; like رِزْمَةٌ: (TA in art. رزم:) in this sense,<br>\
also, it is fem.: or a number of dates collected together: pl. as above. (TA in the present art.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, A cubit: (S, K:) sometimes used in<br>\
this sense: (S:) because a thing is measured<br>\
(يُقَاسُ) with it. (K.)<br>\
قِيسُ رُمْحٍ and قَاسُ رُمْحٍ The measure of a spear.<br>\
(Msb, in this art.; and S, K, in art. قيس.)<br>\
قَوَّاسٌ A hewer, or fashioner, of bows; and so,<br>\
perhaps, قَيَّاسٌ. (TA.)<br>\
قُسَوِىٌّ is the rel. n. from قِسِىٌّ, [pl. of قَوْسٌ,]<br>\
because it is [before its last change] of the<br>\
measure فُلُوعٌ changed from the measure فُعُولٌ.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
أَقْوَسُ Having a bowed, or bent, back. (S, K.)<br>\

horses are placed in a row (S, A, K) on the occasion of racing, (S, K,) in the place whence they<br>\
run: (A:) or the extended rope from which the<br>\
horses are started: (JK:) also called مقيص: the<br>\
pl. is مَقَاوِسُ. (TA.) Hence the saying, عُرِضَ<br>\
فُلَانٌ عَلَى المِقْوَسِ [Such a one has been put to the<br>\
starting-rope]; meaning, (tropical:)  such a one has been<br>\
tried, or proved, by use, practice, or experience.<br>\
(A, TA.) And فُلَانٌ عَلَى مِقْوَسٍ, i. e., عَلَى حِفَاظٍ<br>\
[app. meaning, (assumed tropical:)  Such a one is intent upon defending his honour or the like]. (Lth, L.)<br>\

مُتَقَوِّسٌ (assumed tropical:)  An eyebrow [or other thing] likened to<br>\
