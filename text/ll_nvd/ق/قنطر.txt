قَنْطَرَ الشّىْءِ i. q. عَقَدَهُ وَأَحْكَمَهُ [He tied,<br>\
or knit, the thing; or, agreeably with modern<br>\
usage, he arched, or vaulted, it; and made it<br>\
firm, or strong]. (Zj.) Hence what is called a<br>\
قَنْطَرَة is thus called because of its being firmly,<br>\
or strongly, knit together, or arched, or vaulted,<br>\
لِإِحْكَامِ عَقْدِهَا. (MF.) [It seems to signify He<br>\
compacted the thing. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, He collected the<br>\
thing together into one aggregate; he aggregated<br>\
it. See the pass. part. n., below.]<br>\

(K:) or became possessed of a قنطار of property:<br>\
