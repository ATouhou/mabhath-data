قَحَدَ, aor.<br>\
قَحَدَ, (K,) inf. n. قَحْدٌ; (K, * TK;)<br>\
and ↓ اقحد; (TA;) He (a camel) became in<br>\
the state of having a قَحَدَة [q. v.], (K, TA,)<br>\
meaning, a hump like a cupola; so accord. to<br>\
ISd: (TA:) or became large in the قحدة, (K,<br>\
TA,) after smallness [thereof]: (TA:) and<br>\
قَحَدَتْ, inf. n. قُحُودٌ; and قَحِدَتْ; (IKtt, L;)<br>\
and ↓ اقحدت; (S, IKtt, L;) she (a camel)<br>\
became in the state of having a قَحَدَة: (ISd, L:)<br>\
or became large in her hump; (S, IKtt;) [i. e.]<br>\
became such as is termed مِقْحَاد; (L;) [and] so<br>\
↓ استحقدت: (A, TA: *) or ↓ اقحدت signifies<br>\
she continued always to have a قحدة, even when<br>\
she had become lean. (L.)<br>\

أَقْحَدَ see above, in three places.<br>\

إِسْتَقْحَدَ see the first paragraph.<br>\
قَحَدٌ: see قَحَدَةٌ.<br>\
قَحْدَةٌ, (S, O, K,) originally قَحِدَةٌ, like as one<br>\
says عَشْرَةٌ and عَشِرَةٌ, (S, O, TA,) and فَخْذٌ and<br>\
فَخِذٌ, (TA,) the medial radical being made<br>\
quiescent for the purpose of alleviating the utterance, (S, O, TA,) applied to a she-camel, (K,)<br>\
or to a بَكْرَة [or youthful she-camel, (S, O,)<br>\
Large in the hump: (S, * O:) or large in the<br>\
قَحَدَة [q. v.]: (K:) and ↓ مقْحَادٌ is applied to a<br>\
she-camel (S, O, K) in the former sense, (S, O, *)<br>\
or in the latter sense; (A, * K;) and its pl. is<br>\
مَقَاحِيدُ. (A, O, K.)<br>\
قَحَدَةٌ The base of the hump of a camel; (S,<br>\
A, O, L, K;) [as also ↓ قَحَدٌ, mentioned by<br>\
Freytag as occurring in the Deewán of the Hudhalees, and I find قحد (thus without any syll.<br>\
sign) expl. as having this meaning (as well as<br>\
قحدة) in a copy of the A;] and so ↓ مَقْحَدَةٌ:<br>\
(O, K:) [respecting which last, SM, having<br>\
overlooked it in the O, observes, in the TA, “so<br>\
in all the copies ” (meaning of the K) “ in our<br>\
hands; but I have not found it in the books of<br>\
strange words, nor in the L; and it appears to<br>\
be مَحْقِد; for it is said in the L that IAar<br>\
mentions مَحْفِد [with ف] as having this meaning, that the like of this is mentioned on the<br>\
authority of Aboo-Nasr, and that IAar says that<br>\
مَحْتِد and مَحْفِد and مَحْقِد and مَحْكِد are all<br>\
syn. with أَصْلٌ; but Az says that محقد is not<br>\
mentioned with محتد in the book of Aboo-Turáb: ”] or the portion of the hump, (K, TA,)<br>\
i. e. (TA) the portion of the fat of the hump,<br>\
(Lth, O, L, TA,) that is between the مَأْنَتَانِ [app.<br>\
here meaning the two anterior upper portions<br>\
of the lumbar region, next the back-bone]:<br>\
(Lth, O, L, K, TA:) or the hump (A &#39;Obeyd,<br>\
O, L, K, TA) itself: (TA:) or a hump like a<br>\
cupola: (ISd, TA:) or the قُبَّة [or round, protuberant, upper portion] of the hump: (A:) pl.<br>\
[of mult.] قِحَادٌ (S, O, K) and [of pauc.] أَقْحُدٌ.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
قَحَّادٌ A solitary man, who has neither brother<br>\
nor offspring: (IAar, Sh, O, K, TA:) and وَاحِدٌ<br>\
↓ قَاحِدٌ signifies [the same, or the like; i. q.]<br>\
صُنْبُورٌ: (IAar, Sh, T, O:) [see also صَاخِدٌ:]<br>\
accord. to the K, ↓ قَاحِدٌ in this case is an imitative sequent to وَاحِدٌ, and so accord. to the M:<br>\
and it is said in the T that AA mentions this<br>\
phrase, as on the authority of Abu-l-&#39;Abbás, with<br>\
ف, saying وَاحِدٌ فَاحِدٌ; but that it is correctly as<br>\
mentioned [and expl.] by Sh, on the authority of<br>\
IAar; i. e. that one says ↓ وَاحِدٌ قَاحِدٌ, and<br>\
صَاخِدٌ. (TA.)<br>\
قَاحِدٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
القِمَحْدَةُ: see what next follows.<br>\
القَمَحْدُوَةُ, (S, O,) and ↓ القِمَحْدَةُ, the latter<br>\
like عِرَضْنَة [in form], and mentioned by Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, (O,) [words] in which the م is argumentative, (S, O,) [or, accord. to the K, it is radical,]<br>\
What is behind the head; (S, O;) said by AZ to<br>\
be the part of the bone of the head that protuberates over the back of the neck; the هَامَة [or<br>\
crown] being above it, and the قَذَال, which is<br>\
next to the مَقَدّ [or مَقَذّ, i. e. the part between the<br>\
two ears, behind], being beneath it: (O:) pl. [of<br>\
both] قَمَاحِدُ (S, O) and [of the former] قَمَحْدُوَاتٌ<br>\
[also]. (O.) See also art. قمحد.<br>\
