smoothish, blackish thing, the head of which is like<br>\
that of the [beetle termed] خُنْفَسَآء, and long, and<br>\

is smaller; and it is said that what is called عير<br>\
قبّان is party-coloured, black and white, with white<br>\
legs, having a nose like that of the hedge-hog; when<br>\
it is moved, it feigns itself dead, so that it appears<br>\
like a [small] globular piece of dung; but when the<br>\
voice is withheld, it goes away: (M, TA:) MF<br>\
says that the appellation عير قبّان is used only in<br>\

metre; and is not mentioned in the lexicons of<br>\
celebrity [except the K]. but it is mentioned in<br>\

the appellation حمار قبّان to a certain insect, or<br>\
small creeping thing, above the size of a locust, of<br>\
the same sort as the فَرَاش [generally meaning<br>\
moth]: in the Mufradát of Ibn-El-Beytár, it is<br>\
said that what is called حمار قبّان is also called<br>\
حِمَارُ البَيْتِ: the reason for the appellation [حمار<br>\
قبّان] seems to be because its back resembles a<br>\
قُبَّة: (TA:) قَبَّان in this case is of the measure<br>\
فَعْلَان, from قَبَّ, (S, O, K,) because the Arabs<br>\
imperfectly decline it, and they use it determinately; if it were of the measure فَعَّال, they would<br>\
decline it perfectly; the pl. is حُمُرُ قَبَّانَ. (S, O.)<br>\
