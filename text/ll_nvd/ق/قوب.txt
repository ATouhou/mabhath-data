قَابَ الأَرْضَ, aor. يَقُوبُهَا, (S, O,) inf. n. قَوْبٌ;<br>\
(K;) and ↓ قوّبها, (S, O,) inf. n. تَقْوِيبٌ; (S, O,<br>\
K;) He dug, or made a hollow in, the ground:<br>\
(K:) or he dug a round hollow in the ground;<br>\
(S, O, TA;) thus both phrases are expl. by ISd.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And قاب بَيْضَهُ, (S, O,) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(K,) It (a bird) broke asunder its eggs. (S, O, K.)<br>\
-A2-  قاب is also intrans., signifying جِلْدُهُ ↓ تقوّب<br>\
[app. His skin became pitted, or marked with<br>\
small hollows: see an explanation of 2, of which<br>\
تقوّب is quasi-pass.]. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-  قابت البَيْضَةُ:<br>\
see 7.<br>\
-A3-  Also (قاب) He was, or became, near;<br>\
drew near; or approached: and He fled: (O, K,<br>\
TA:) inf. n. قَوْبٌ: (TA:) thus it has two contr.<br>\
significations. (K, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
قَوَّبَ see above, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  One says also,<br>\
قَوَّبْتُ الأَرْضَ meaning I made impressions, marks,<br>\
or traces, upon the ground, (O, K, TA,) by<br>\
treading; and made indications [thereby, or<br>\
thereof,] at its drinking-places. (TA.) And<br>\
قَوَّبوا الأَرْضَ, (A, TA,) or فِى الأَرْضِ, (O,) They<br>\
(i. e. persons alighting, A, TA) made impressions,<br>\
marks, or traces, upon the ground, (A, O, TA,)<br>\
by their treading and their alighting. (O.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And قوّب الجَرَبُ جِلْدَ البَعِيرِ The mange, or scab,<br>\
made pits, or small hollows, bare of fur, in the<br>\
skin of the camel. (Lth, TA.) See also 5. ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
قُوِّبَ مِنَ الغُبَارِ means اِغْبَرَّ [i. e., app., He, or it,<br>\
became sullied with dust]. (Th, TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
قوّبهُ, inf. n. تَقْوِيبٌ, He pulled it out or up, by<br>\
the root; eradicated, or uprooted, it. (K, * TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تقوّبت الأَرْضُ: see 7. ―<br>\
-b2-  تقوّب جِلْدُهُ:<br>\
see 1. ―<br>\
-b3-  تقوّب also signifies It became peeled,<br>\
or excoriated, or became so in several, or many,<br>\
places. (TA.) One says, تقوّب مِنْ رَأْسِهِ مَوَاضِعُ<br>\
Some places in his head became excoriated. (S.)<br>\
In the saying of Dhn-r-Rummeh,<br>\
تَقَوَّبَ عَنْ غِرْبَانِ أَوْرَاكِهَا الخَطْرُ<br>\
تَقَوَّبَ may be for ↓ قَوَّبَ [q. v.]: or the phrase<br>\
may be inverted, for تَقَوَّبَتْ غِرْبَانُهَا عَنِ الخَطْرِ.<br>\
(S in art. خطر. [See غُرَابٌ, in art. غرب.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  It<br>\
is also said of a place as meaning It became, in<br>\
parts, stripped of trees and herbage; and so<br>\
↓ انقاب. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And it signifies also It<br>\
was pulled out or up, by the root; was eradicated,<br>\
or uprooted. (S, O, K. *) ―<br>\
-b6-  تقوّبت البَيْضَةُ: see<br>\
the next paragraph.<br>\
7<br>\
اسقابت الأَرْضُ The ground was hollowed out<br>\
in a round form; (S, ISd, O, TA;) as also<br>\
↓ تقوّبت. (ISd, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 5. ―<br>\
-b3-  انقابت<br>\
البَيْضَةُ, and ↓ تقوّبت, (S, A, O, K, TA,) and<br>\
↓ قَابَت, (TA,) The egg broke asunder, (S, A, O,<br>\
K, TA,) and disclosed the young bird within it.<br>\
(TA.) [Hence] one says اِنْقَابَتْ بِيْضَةُ بَنِى فُلَانٍ<br>\
عَنْ أَمْرِهِمْ [lit. The egg of the sons of such a one<br>\
broke asunder, and disclosed their affair, case, or<br>\
state]: meaning (tropical:)  the sons of such a one revealed,<br>\
or manifested, their affair, case, or state; a phrase<br>\
like أَفْرَخَتْ بَيْضَتُهُمْ. (A, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اقتابهُ He chose, made choice of, selected,<br>\
elected, or preferred, him, or it. (O, K.)<br>\
قَابٌ The portion, of a bow, that is between the<br>\
part that is grasped by the hand and the curved<br>\
extremity: to every bow there are قَابَانِ: (S,<br>\
O, Msb, K:) or, accord. to El-Khafájee, it is [the<br>\
space] between the string and the part that is<br>\
grasped by the hand, of the bow; as also ↓ قِيبٌ:<br>\
(TA:) in the Kur [liii. 9], فَكَانَ قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ<br>\
accord. to some, is an inverted phrase, meaning<br>\
فكان قَابَىْ قَوْسٍ [i. e. And he was at the distance<br>\
of the measure of the two portions between the<br>\
part that is grasped by the hand and each of the<br>\
curved extremities of a bow]: (S, O:) [but] قَابٌ<br>\
signifies also a measure, or space; and so ↓ قِيبٌ:<br>\
(S, O, K:) one says, بَيْنَهُمَا قَابُ قَوْسٍ and<br>\
قَوْسٍ ↓ قِيبُ, [Between them two is the measure<br>\
of a bow], and likewise قَادُ قُوْسٍ and قِيدُ قَوْسٍ:<br>\
(S, O: *) and it is said that قَابَ قَوْسَيْنِ [in the<br>\
case mentioned above] means at [the distance of] the<br>\
length of two bows: or as Fr says, at [the distance of]<br>\
the measure of two Arabian bows. (TA.) [قابُ<br>\
قَوْسٍ is also a term often used in astronomy to<br>\
denote the distance between two stars; and seems<br>\
to be syn. with ذِرَاعٌ (q. v.) as so used, thus meaning A cubit; which is the measure of each قاب<br>\
of a bow, or nearly so.]<br>\
قُوبٌ A young bird; (S, A, O, K;) as also<br>\
↓ قَائِبَةٌ and ↓ قَابَةٌ: (K:) or ↓ قَائِبَةٌ signifies, (S,<br>\
A, O,) or signifies also, (K,) an egg; (S, A, O,<br>\
K;) and so does ↓ قَابَةٌ: (K;) ↓ قَائِبَةٌ is used<br>\
in the latter sense as meaning ذَاتُ قُوبٍ, i. e.<br>\
ذَاتُ فَرْخٍ: (Az, * O, TA: *) or it is like رَاضِيَةٌ in<br>\
the phrase عِيشَةٌ رَاضِيَةٌ [meaning مَرْضِيَّةٌ]: (A:)<br>\
[or as being originally the part. n. of قَابَت in the<br>\
phrase قَابَتِ البَيْضَةُ: and it may be used in the<br>\
former sense as being originally the act. part. n.<br>\
of قَابَت in the phrase قَابَتِ البَيْضَةَ said of a<br>\
hen-bird:] and ↓ قَاوِبَةٌ signifies an egg from<br>\
which the young bird has come forth: (Az, TA:) or<br>\
قُوبٌ signifies an egg: and ↓ قَابَةٌ, a young bird:<br>\
(AHeyth, TA:) the pl. of قُوبٌ is أَقْوَابٌ. (K.)<br>\
It is said in a prov., مِنْ قُوبٍ ↓ بَرِئَتْ قَائِبَةٌ, (S,<br>\
A, O,) or مِنْ قُوبٍ ↓ تَخَلَّصَتْ قَائَبِةٌ, (K,) or<br>\
مِنْ قُوبٍ ↓ قَابَةٌ, (tropical:)  An egg became or has become,<br>\
freed from a young bird [that was in it]: (S, A,<br>\
O, K:) or a young bird, from an egg: (AHeyth,<br>\
TA:) applied to him who has become separated<br>\
from his companion. (A, * K.) An Arab of the<br>\
desert, of the tribe of Asad, (S,) or Asd, (O,)<br>\
said to a merchant who asked him to be his safeguard, مِنْ ↓ إِذَا بَلَغْتُ بِكَ مَكَانَ كَذَا بَرِئَتْ قَائِبَةٌ<br>\
قُوبٍ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  [When I shall have reached with<br>\
thee such a place,] I shall be clear of obligation<br>\
to protect thee. (S, O.) El-Kumeyt says<br>\
لَهُنَّ وَلِلْمَشِيبِ وَمَنْ عَلَاهُ<br>\
وَقُوبُ ↓ مِنَ الأَمْثَالِ قَائِبَةٌ<br>\
[To them (i. e. women), and to hoariness and him<br>\
upon whom it has come, relates, among the proverbs, “An egg and a young bird ”]: he likens<br>\
the fleeing of women from old men to the fleeing<br>\
of the قُوب, or young bird, from the قَائِبَة, or<br>\
egg; and [virtually] says that the beautiful<br>\
woman will not return to the old man, like as<br>\
the young bird will not return to the egg. (TA.)<br>\
And Aboo-&#39;Alee El-Kálee mentions the saying,<br>\
مِنْ قُوبٍ ↓ لَا وَالَّذِى أَخْرَجَ قَائِبَةً, as meaning<br>\
[No, by Him who has produced] a young bird<br>\
from an egg: but Aboo-&#39;Obeyd El-Bekree says<br>\
that this is inverted. (MF, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أُمُّ قُوبٍ [in<br>\
the TA said to be بالفتح, a mistranscription<br>\
for بِالضَّمِّ,] Calamity, or misfortune. (O, K.)<br>\
قُوَبٌ [in the two phrases here following is<br>\
probably pl. of ↓ قُوبَةٌ]. You say, فِى الأَرْضِ قُوَبٌ<br>\
In the ground are hollows [app. meaning round<br>\
hollows: see 1, first sentence]. (A.) And فِى<br>\
رَأْسِهِ وَجِلْدِهِ قُوَبٌ In his head and his skin are<br>\
pits. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence ↓ القُوَبَآءُ. (A.)<br>\
See قُوَبَآءُ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-  It signifies [also]<br>\
Egg-shells. (O, K.)<br>\
قِيبٌ: see قَابٌ, in three places.<br>\
قُابَةٌ: see قُوبٌ: in four places.<br>\
قُوبَةٌ: see قُوَبٌ: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also قُوَبَآءُ, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
قُوَبَةٌ: see قُوَبَآءُ, in three places.<br>\
-A2-  Also, (K,)<br>\
applied to a man such as is termed مَلِىْءٌ [app. as<br>\
meaning “ rich,” or “ wealthy ”], One who remains<br>\
constantly in his abode, (S, K,) not quitting it.<br>\
(S.)<br>\
قُوَبَآءُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) fem., and imperfectly<br>\
decl., (S, O,) and قُوْبَآءٌ, (S, O, Msb, K,) which is<br>\
masc., and perfectly decl., as quasi-coordinate to<br>\
قُرْطَاسٌ, said by ISk to be the only word of the<br>\
measure فُعْلَآءٌ except خُشَّآءٌ, (S, O,) both originally<br>\
of the measure فُعَلَآءُ, (O,) but to these may be<br>\
added مُزَّآءٌ, (S, O,) [and perhaps some other<br>\
instances,] and ↓ قُوَبَةٌ and ↓ قُوْبَةٌ, (O, K,) both<br>\
of which are said by Fr to signify the same as<br>\
قُوَيَآءُ, (O,) [Ringworm, or tetter; so called in the<br>\
present day;] a well-known disease, (S, O, Msb,)<br>\
characterized by excoriation and spreading, and<br>\
cured by spittle, (S, O, TA,) or by the spittle of<br>\
one who is fasting or hungry; (TA; [see an ex.<br>\
in a verse cited voce فِلْقٌ;]) a cutaneous eruption,<br>\
in which scabs peel off from the skin, and the hair<br>\
comes off: (K, TA:) see قُوَبٌ, above: ↓ قُوَبٌ is<br>\
[also] pl. of تُوَبَآءُ [like as نُفَسٌ is of نُفَسَآءُ], (S,)<br>\
[and] so is قَوَابِىُّ: (KL:) ISd says, accord. to<br>\
IAar, قُوَبَآءُ is sing. of ↓ قُوْبَةٌ and ↓ قُوَبَةٌ; but I<br>\
know not how this can be: and he [i. e. IAar]<br>\
also says that ↓ قُوَبٌ is pl. of ↓ قُوْبَةٌ and ↓ قُوَبَةٌ;<br>\
and this is clear. (TA.) The dim. of قُوَبَآءُ is<br>\
↓ قُوَيْبَآءُ; and that of قُوْبَآءٌ is ↓ قُوَيْبِىٌّ. (S, O.)<br>\
قُوبِىٌّ Fond of, or addicted to, the eating of<br>\
young birds, (O, K, TA,) which are termed أَقْوَاب<br>\
[pl. of قُوبٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
قُوَيْبَآءُ and قُوَيْبِىٌّ: see قُوَبَآءُ, concluding sentence.<br>\
قَائِبَةٌ and قَاوِبَةٌ: see قُوبٌ; the former in eight<br>\
places, and the latter in one place. قَائِبَةُ قُوبٍ<br>\
means An empty egg: to such, in a trad., Mekkeh<br>\
is likened when devoid of pilgrims. (O.)<br>\
أَرْضٌ مقوبةٌ [i. e. مَقُوبَةٌ or مُقَوَّبَةٌ, being written<br>\
without any syll. signs,] Land upon which rain<br>\
has fallen, and in consequence thereof, in some<br>\
places, trees that were in it formerly have been<br>\
carried away: mentioned by AHn. (TA.)<br>\
مُتَقَوِّبٌ Peeled, or excoriated; or so in several,<br>\
or many, places. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And One from whose<br>\
skin scabs have peeled off, (A, K, TA,) leaving<br>\
upon it marks, (A,) and whose hair has come<br>\
off [at those places]. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And A<br>\
serpent (S, O, K) of the species termed أَسْوَدُ (S,<br>\
O) that has cast off its skin. (S, O, K.)<br>\
