صُلْبًا ↓ البَقْلُ مُقْتَرِحًا [as though meaning the herbs,<br>\
or leguminous plants, grow putting forth the stem<br>\
in a hard, or firm, state]; but it should be<br>\
↓ مُقَرِّحًا, unless ↓ اِقْتَرَحَ be a dial. var. of قَرَّحَ: or<br>\

قَرْحٌ and ↓ قُرْحٌ A wound; (L;) the bite of a<br>\

عَضُّ السِّلَاحِ وَنَحْوِهِ مِمَّا يَجْرَحُ البَدَنَ (which is the<br>\
reading in the CK), we find عضّ السلاح وَنَحْوُهُ<br>\
ممّا يَخْرُجُ بِالبَدَنِ, and the L and TA combine the<br>\
two readings, the latter whereof gives a second<br>\
signification, which will be found below:]) i. q.<br>\
جُرْحٌ [with which جَرْحٌ is held by many to be<br>\
syn.]: (TA:) they are two dial. vars., (S, Msb,)<br>\
like ضَعْفٌ and ضُعْفٌ, (S,) and جَهْدٌ and جُهْدٌ,<br>\
(Fr, Msb, TA,) and وَجْدٌ and وُجْدٌ; (Fr, TA;)<br>\
the former of the dial. of El-Hijáz: (Msb:) or<br>\
the former is an inf. n. and the latter is a simple<br>\
subst.: (L, Msb:) or the former signifies as<br>\
above; and the latter signifies its pain: (A:) or<br>\
the latter seems to bear this latter signification;<br>\
and the former, to signify wounds themselves:<br>\
(Yaakoob, TA:) [and the like is said in the L<br>\
and K:]) [and thus used in a pl. sense, the<br>\
former is a coll. gen. n.;] and its n. un. is ↓ قَرْحَةٌ;<br>\

him is pain from a wound; (A;) or from wounds.<br>\
(L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  قَرْحٌ also signifies Pustules, or small<br>\
swellings, when they have become corrupt; (L,<br>\
K;) [i. e. purulent pustules; and imposthumes,<br>\
ulcers, or sores: and so ↓ قُرْحٌ accord. to the L<br>\
and some copies of the K, as shown above; but<br>\
this seems to be of doubtful authority: قَرْحٌ in<br>\
this sense is a coll. gen. n.:] its n. un. is ↓ قَرْحَةٌ;<br>\
and pl. قُرُوحٌ. (S.) Imra-el-Keys (the poet,<br>\
TA) was called ذُو القُرُوحِ because the King of<br>\
the Greeks sent to him a poisoned shirt, from the<br>\
wearing of which his body became affected with<br>\
purulent pustules, or ulcers, or sores, (تَقَرَّحَ,) and<br>\
he died: (S, K, * TA:) or, as some say, he was<br>\
called ذُو الفُرُوجٍ, with ف and ج; because he left<br>\
only daughters. (Es-Suyootee, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also,<br>\
(accord. to the K,) or ↓ قُرْحٌ, (as in the L,) A<br>\
severe scab or mange, that destroys young weaned<br>\
camels; (L, K;) or that attacks young weaned<br>\
camels, and from which they scarcely ever, or<br>\
never, recover: so says Lth: Az, however, says<br>\
that this is a mistake; but that قُرْحَةٌ signifies a<br>\
certain disease that attacks camels, expl. below.<br>\
(L.)<br>\
-A2-  See also قَرِيحٌ.<br>\
قُرْحٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
-A2-  See also قَرِيحَةٌ in two places. [Hence]<br>\
one says, هُوَ فِى قُرْحِ سِنِّهِ (tropical:)  He is in the first part<br>\
of his age. (TA.) أَنَا فِى قُرْحِ الثَّلَاثِينَ (tropical:)  I am<br>\
in the beginning of the thirtieth [year] was said<br>\
by an Arab of the desert to IAar, who had asked<br>\

written القُرَحُ [pl. of ↓ القُرْحَةُ], (MF, TA,)<br>\
signifies Three nights (K, TA) of the first part<br>\

a child) of having never been attacked by the<br>\
small-pox. (S.)<br>\

breaking out with قُرُوح [or purulent pustules].<br>\

two places:<br>\

قُرْحَةٌ A disease that attacks camels, consisting<br>\
in قُرُوح [or purulent pustules] in the mouth, in<br>\
consequence of which the lip hangs down; not scab,<br>\
or mange. (Az, L, TA.) [See also قَرْحٌ, near<br>\
the end.]<br>\
-A2-  Also A غُرَّة [meaning star, or blaze,<br>\
or white mark,] in the middle of the forehead of a<br>\
horse: (T, L:) or what is less than a غُرَّة in the<br>\
face of a horse: (S, K:) or it is a whiteness in<br>\
the forehead of a horse (Mgh) of the size of a<br>\
dirhem, or smaller than it; (AO, Mgh, TA;)<br>\
whereas the غُرَّة is larger than a dirhem: (AO,<br>\
TA:) or what is like a small dirhem between a<br>\
horse&#39;s eyes: (En-Nadr, TA:) or any whiteness,<br>\
in the face of a horse, which stops short of reaching the place of the halter upon the nose; differently distinguished in relation to its form, as being<br>\

white mark upon the face of the common fly: (see<br>\
قَدُوحٌ:) the pl. is قُرَحٌ, like غُرَرٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence] one<br>\
says, هُوَ قَرْحَةُ أَصْحَابِهِ i. e. غُرَّتُهُمْ [meaning (tropical:)  He<br>\
is the noble, or eminent, one of his companions; or<br>\

(S, K) and to two (S) and to a pl. number, (S,<br>\
A, K,) and expl. as meaning persons not yet<br>\
attacked by disease, (S,) and also applied alike to<br>\
the male and to the female: (TA:) قُرْحَانُونَ [as<br>\
a pl. thereof] is of weak authority, (K,) or disused. (S, A, L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence] one says, أَنْتَ<br>\
بِهِ ↓ قُرْحَانٌ مِمَّا قُرِحْتَ i. e. (tropical:)  Thou art clear [of<br>\
that whereof thou hast been accused]. (A, TA.)<br>\

A species of كَمَأَة [or truffle], (S, K, TA,) white,<br>\
small, and having heads like those of the فُطْر [or<br>\
