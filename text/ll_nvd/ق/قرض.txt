piece of cloth, (A, Mgh,) with the مِقْرَاض, (A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) and with the مِقْرَاضَانِ; (Msb;) and<br>\
in like manner, [or as signifying he cut it much,<br>\
or frequently, or repeatedly,] you say, ↓ قرّضهُ, (M,<br>\
TA,) inf. n. تَقْرِيضٌ: (TA:) this is the primary<br>\
signification. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) said of a<br>\
rat, or mouse, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, A, Mgh, Msb,) aor.<br>\
and inf. n. as above, (S, * Msb, TA,) He [cut it<br>\
with his teeth; gnawed it; or] ate it; (Msb;)<br>\
namely a garment, or piece of cloth, (S, A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA,) and bread, &amp;c. (TA.) You say<br>\
also قَرَضَهُ بِنَابِهِ He cut it with his canine tooth, or<br>\
fang. (A.) And قَرَضَ البَعِيرُ جَرَّتَهُ, (M, TA,)<br>\
aor. as above, (A, TA,) and so the inf. n., (TA,)<br>\
The camel chewed his cud: (M, A, TA:) or<br>\
returned it [to his mouth, to be chewed again, or<br>\

-b3-  [Hence also,] قَرَضَ<br>\
رِبَاطَهُ, (S, M, A, K,) [lit.] He cut, or severed,<br>\
his bond, i. e. the bond of his heart; and consequently, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  he died; (IAar, M, K, TA;)<br>\

not explained] O, Msb, K,) and قَرِضَ: (IAar, O,<br>\
K:) or (assumed tropical:)  he was at the point of death. (K.)<br>\
And you say, جَآءَ وَقَدْ قَرَضَ رِبَاطَهُ (AZ, Az, S,<br>\
&amp;c.) (assumed tropical:)  He came harassed, or distressed, or fatigued, and at the point of death: (AZ, Az:) or<br>\
(tropical:)  harassed, or distressed, by thirst, or by fatigue:<br>\
(A:) or (assumed tropical:)  in a state of intense thirst and hunger:<br>\
(M:) said of a man: (S:) mentioned in the S<br>\
in such a manner as [appears] to indicate that<br>\
the verb has here the first of the significations<br>\
mentioned in this art.; but this is not the case<br>\
[as is shown in the S itself in art. ربط]. (TA.)<br>\
See also 7.<br>\
-A2-  [Hence also,] قَرَضْتُ الوَادِى (assumed tropical:)  I<br>\
passed through, or across, the valley. (Msb.)<br>\
It is said in the Kur, [xviii. 16,] وَإِذَا غَرَبَتْ<br>\
تَقْرِضُهُمْ ذَاتَ الشِّمَالِ (assumed tropical:)  And when it [the sun] set,<br>\
to leave them behind on the left; to pass by and<br>\
beyond them, leaving them on its left: (S, K:)<br>\
so explained by AO, or by A&#39;Obeyd: (so<br>\
accord. to different copies of the S,) to leave<br>\
them and pass by them on the left; not falling<br>\
upon them at all: (Jel:) or to turn aside,<br>\
or away, from them, on the left: (Msb:) or to<br>\
be over against them, on the left: from قَرَضْتُهُ,<br>\
meaning حَذَوْتُهُ, i. e. I was over against him, or<br>\
it; as also ↓ أَقْرَضْتُهُ. (JK.) And a man says to<br>\
his companion, Hast thou passed by such and<br>\
such a place? and the man asked says قَرَضْتُهُ ذَاتَ<br>\
اليَمِينِ لَيْلًا (assumed tropical:)  [I passed by it, leaving it behind, on<br>\
the right, by night]. (S.) The Arabs say,<br>\
قَرَضْتُهُ ذَاتَ اليَمِينِ, and ذَاتَ الشِّمَالِ, and قُبُلًا, and<br>\
دُبُرًا, (assumed tropical:)  I was over against him, or it, on the right,<br>\
and on the left, and before, and behind. (Fr.)<br>\
You say also, قَرَضَ المَكَانَ, (M, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
and inf. n. as above, (M,) (assumed tropical:)  He turned aside, or<br>\
away, from the place. (M, Msb, K.) And<br>\
قَرَضَ فِى الأَرْضِ (assumed tropical:)  He traversed the land. (Z.)<br>\
And قَرَضَ فِى سَيْرِهِ, (M, K,) aor. and inf. n. as<br>\

going or journeying. (M, K.) And قَرِضَ, like<br>\
سَمِعَ, (assumed tropical:)  He, or it, passed away from a thing to<br>\
another thing. (IAar, Sgh, L, K.)<br>\
-A3-  Hence<br>\
also, (TA,) قَرَضَ الشِّعْرَ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. as<br>\
above, (S, Msb,) and so the inf. n., (S,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
said, spoke, uttered, or recited, poetry; or he<br>\
poetized, or versified; syn. قَالَ الشِّعْرَ: (A&#39;Obeyd,<br>\
S, K:) or he composed poetry according to rule:<br>\
(Msb:) because poetry consists of cut feet: or<br>\
because it is called قَرِيض as being likened to the<br>\
cud: (A:) or because it is language cut out:<br>\
(Msb:) or as being likened to a garment; as<br>\
though the poet cut it and divided it into<br>\
portions; although MF denies that this phrase<br>\
is from قَرَضَ as signifying “ he cut: ” he has also<br>\
assigned to قَرْضُ الشِّعْرِ a signification which belongs<br>\
to تَقْرِيضٌ, q. v. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  Hence also, قَرَضَهُ as<br>\
syn. with قَارَضَهُ, q. v. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
قَرَّضَ see 1, first signification.<br>\
-A2-  تَقْرِيضٌ also<br>\
signifies (assumed tropical:)  The art of poetry: (M, TA:) or<br>\
the criticism thereof; the picking out the faults<br>\
thereof; and the discriminating, by consideration,<br>\
of what is good thereof from what is bad, both<br>\
expressed and speculative. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, like<br>\
تَقْرِيظٌ; (assumed tropical:)  The act of praising: or dispraising:<br>\
(S, TA:) or it has both these contr. significations; (K, TA;) relating to good and to<br>\
evil; whereas تقريظ relates only to praise and<br>\
good. (TA.) You say, فُلَان يُقَرِّضُ صَاحِبَهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Such a one praises his companion: or dispraises<br>\
him. (S.)<br>\
3<br>\
قارضهُ, inf. n. مُقَارَضَةٌ and قِرَاضٌ, (M,) [He<br>\
lent to him, and received from him, a loan: or<br>\
it signifies, or signifies also,] i. q. أَقْرَضَهُ, q. v.<br>\
(L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  قِرَاضٌ (S, A, Msb, K) and مُقَارَضَةٌ,<br>\
(S, A, K,) with the people of El-Hijáz, (TA,)<br>\
also signify i. q. مُضَارَبَةٌ; (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K;)<br>\
as though it were a contract for traversing the<br>\
land [for traffic], (K,) from القَرْضُ فِى السَّيْرِ, or,<br>\
as Z says, from القَرْضُ فِى الأَرْضِ, meaning “ the<br>\
traversing the land,” like as مضاربة is from<br>\
الضَّرْبُ فِى الأَرْضِ; (TA;) and the form of the<br>\
contract is what is shown by the following explanation. (K.) You say, قَارَضْتُهُ, (S, A, Mgh,)<br>\
or قَارَضْتُهُ مِنَ المَالِ, (Msb,) I gave to him<br>\
property (S, A, Mgh, K *) مُضَارَبَةً, (A, Mgh,)<br>\
[i. e.] that he might traffic with it, on the condition that the gain should be between us, and the<br>\
loss should fall upon the property. (S, K. [See<br>\
also ضَارَبَهُ.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  قارضهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. مُقَارَضَةٌ,<br>\
(TA,) also signifies (tropical:)  He requited him; he compensated him; (S, K;) and so ↓ قَرَضَهُ, (S, K,)<br>\
inf. n. قَرْضٌ. (TA.) Hence the saying of Abu-l-Wardà, (TA,) إِنْ قَارَضْتَ النَّاسَ قَارَضُوكَ وَإِنْ<br>\
تَرَكْتَهُمْ لَمْ يَتْرُكُوكَ وَإِنْ هَرَبْتَ مِنْهُمْ أَدْرَكُوكَ<br>\
(tropical:)  (A, * TA) [If thou requite men their evil deeds,<br>\
they will requite thee; and if thou leave them,<br>\
they will not leave thee; and if thou flee from<br>\
them, they will overtake thee]: meaning if thou<br>\
do evil to them, they will do the like thereof to<br>\
thee; and if thou leave them, thou wilt not be<br>\
safe from them, for they will not let thee alone;<br>\
and if thou revile them and injure them, they<br>\
will revile thee and injure thee: he said this intending thereby to censure them: and it is from<br>\
the signification of “ cutting. ” (TA.) [See also<br>\
قَرْضٌ, below.] You say also, فُلَانٌ يُقَارِضُ النَّاسَ,<br>\
inf. n. مُقَارَضَةٌ, (tropical:)  Such a one accords, or agrees,<br>\
with men. (A.) And قَارَضْتُهُ الزِّيَارَةَ (tropical:)  [I interchanged visiting with him]. (A.)<br>\
4<br>\
اقرضهُ He cut off for him a portion, to be<br>\
requited, or compensated, for it. (Sgh, K.)<br>\
[And hence,] He gave him, or granted him, a<br>\
قَرْض [or loan, or the like]; (S, M, A, * Mgh, *<br>\
K;) and ↓ قَارَضَهُ signifies the same as اقرضهُ. (L,<br>\
TA.) You say also, اقرضهُ المَالَ, (M, Msb,)<br>\
وَغَيْرَهُ, (M,) [He lent him the property, &amp;c.;] he<br>\
gave him the property, &amp;c., as a قَرْض; (M;) he<br>\
gave him the property, [&amp;c.,] to demand its<br>\
return. (Msb.) It is said in the Kur, [lxxiii.<br>\
20,] وَأَقْرِضُوا اللّٰهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا [lit. And lend ye to<br>\
God a good loan; meaning (assumed tropical:)  give ye to God<br>\
good service for which to be requited]: (S, TA:)<br>\
it is not here said إِقْرَاضًا because the simple subst.<br>\
[as distinguished from the inf. n.] is what is<br>\
meant. (TA.) And again, in the same, [ii. 246,<br>\
and lvii. 11,] مَنْ ذَا الَّذِى يُقْرِضُ اللّٰهَ قَرْضًا حَسَنًا,<br>\
meaning, accord. to Aboo-Is-hák the Grammarian, (assumed tropical:)  [Who is he who will offer unto God] a<br>\
good action or gift, or anything for which a<br>\
requital may be sought? or, as Akh says, (assumed tropical:)  Who<br>\
will do a good action by following and obeying the<br>\
command of God? (TA.) The Arabs say,<br>\
قَدْ أَقْرَضْتَنِى قَرْضًا حَسَنًا (assumed tropical:)  Thou hast done to me a<br>\
good deed [which I am bound to requite]. (TA.)<br>\
And it is said in a trad., أَقْرِضٌ عِرْضَكَ لِيَوْمِ فَقْرِكَ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [Lend thou thine honour for the day of thy<br>\
poverty]; meaning, when a man defames thee, do<br>\
not thou requite him, but reserve his recompense<br>\
undiminished for thee, as a loan for the payment<br>\
of which he is responsible, that thou mayest<br>\
receive it from him in the day of thy need thereof: (TA:) [but see عِرْضٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,]<br>\
أَقْرَضَنِى الشَّىْءَ He gave, or paid, to me the thing.<br>\
(M.)<br>\
-A2-  مَا عَلَيْهِ مَا يُقْرِضُ عَنْهُ العُيُونَ فَيَسْتُرُهُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [There is not upon him what will turn aside, or<br>\
away, from him the eyes, and cover him]. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, Sgh.)<br>\
-A3-  See alse 1, latter half.<br>\
6<br>\
تَقَاْرَضَ [تَقَارَضَا They lent and received loans, each<br>\
to and from the other.]<br>\
-A2-  [And hence,] هُمَا<br>\
يَتَقَارَضَانِ الخَيْرَ وَالشَّرَّ (assumed tropical:)  [They two interchanged<br>\
good and evil, each with the other]; (IKh, S, K;)<br>\
as also يتقارظان: (IKh:) [but see the latter in<br>\
its proper place.] And هُمَا يَتَقَارَضَانِ المَدْحَ,<br>\
(AZ,) or الثَّنَآءَ, (A, Msb,) or الثَّنَآءَ بَيْنَهُمْ, (TA,) [or<br>\
بَيْنَهُمَا, (in the M, هُمْ يَتَقَارَضُونَ الثَّنَآءَ بَيْنَهُمْ,)]<br>\
(tropical:)  They praise each other; (AZ, Msb;) as also<br>\
يتقارظان: (AZ:) or they requite, or compensate,<br>\
each other with praise. (TA.) And القِرْنَانِ<br>\
يَتَقَارَضَانِ النَّظَرَ (assumed tropical:)  The two opponents, or adversaries, look askance, with anger, each at the other:<br>\
(S, K:) and يَتَقَارَضُونَ نَظَرًا (assumed tropical:)  They look with<br>\
enmity and vehement hatred, one at another.<br>\
(TA.) And هُمْ يَتَقَارَضُونَ الزِّيَارَةَ (tropical:)  [They interchange visiting]. (A.) El-Kumeyt, says,<br>\
يَتَقَارَضُ الحَسَنَ الجَمِيلَ مِنَ التَّأَلُّفِ وَالتَّزَاوُرْ<br>\
meaning, Interchanging what is good and comely,<br>\
of sociable conduct and mutual visiting. (O.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
El-Hasan El-Basree, being asked whether the<br>\
companions of the Apostle of God used to jest, or<br>\
joke, answered, (TA,) نَعَمْ وَيَتَقَارَضُونَ, (K, * TA,)<br>\
i. e. Yes, and they used to recite poetry [one to<br>\
another]: (TA:) from قَرِيضٌ as signifying<br>\
“ poetry. ” (K.)<br>\
7<br>\
انقرضوا (assumed tropical:)  They passed away, or perished, [as<br>\
though cut off,] (S, K,) all of them, (K,) not one<br>\
of them remaining; (S;) as also ↓ قُرِضُوا [perhaps<br>\
a mistake for قَرِضُوا: see 1]. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اقترض He received what is termed قَرْض [a<br>\
loan, or the like], (S, Msb, K,) i. q. اِسْتَلَفَ; (A;)<br>\
مِنْهُ from him. (S, A, K.)<br>\
-A2-  اقترض عِرْضَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
defamed him, or spoke evil of him, behind his<br>\
back or in his absence, or otherwise; syn. اِغْتَابَهُ:<br>\
(K:) as though he cut off [somewhat] from his<br>\
honour. (TA.)<br>\
10<br>\
استقرض مِنْ فُلَانٍ, (S, Msb, *) or استقرضهُ,<br>\
(A, Mgh,) He sought, or demanded, of such a one<br>\
what is termed قَرْض [a loan, or the like]. (S,<br>\
A, * Mgh, * Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence,] اِسْتَقْرَضْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ<br>\
I sought, or demanded, of him the gift, or payment [in advance], of the thing. (M.)<br>\
قَرْضٌ (S, M, A, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ قِرْضٌ;<br>\
(Ks, S, M, K;) or, accord. to Th, the former is<br>\
an inf. n., and the latter a simple subst., but this<br>\
[says ISd] does not please me; (M;) or the<br>\
former is an inf. n. used as a subst.; (Mgh;) or<br>\
a subst. from أَقْرَضْتُهُ المَالَ; (Msb;) [A loan:<br>\
and the like:] a piece of property which a man<br>\
cuts off from his [other] articles of property, and<br>\
which, itself, he receives back; [in rendering the<br>\
explanation in the Mgh, for the words فَيُعْطِيه عينًا<br>\
in my copy of that work; I read فَيُقْضَاهُ عَيْنًا,<br>\
which makes this agreeable with explanations<br>\
given in other works;] but what is due to the<br>\
one from the other as a debt is not so called;<br>\
(Mgh, [see دَيْنٌ;]) what one gives, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
to another, (Msb,) of property, (S, Msb,) to<br>\
receive it back, (S, K,) or to demand it back:<br>\
(Msb:) or a thing that one gives to be requited for<br>\
it, or to receive it back: (TA in art. فرض:) or a<br>\
thing of which men demand the payment [or<br>\
restitution], one of another: (M, L:) or a thing<br>\
which a man gives, or (assumed tropical:)  does, to be requited for<br>\
it: (Aboo-Is-hák the Grammarian, and TA:)<br>\
pl. قُرُوضٌ. (M, Msb.) You say, عَلَيْهِ قَرْضٌ<br>\
[He owes a loan], and قُرُوضٌ [loans]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Hence, (S, TA,) (tropical:)  What one does, in order to be<br>\
requited it, of good, and of evil. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
See three exs. above, under 4. The Arabs also<br>\
say, قَدْ أَحْسَنْتَ قَرْضِى, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Thou hast done<br>\
to me a good deed [which I am bound to requite].<br>\
(TA.) And لَكَ عِنْدِى قَرْضٌ حَسَنٌ, and قَرْضٌ سَيِّئٌ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I owe thee a good deed, and an evil deed.<br>\
(Aboo-Is-hák the Grammarian, and TA.)<br>\
قِرْضٌ: see قَرْضٌ.<br>\
قَرِيضٌ The cud: (Lth, A:) or what the camel<br>\
returns [to his mouth, to be chewed again, or to<br>\
his stomach,] of his cud; (S, K;) as also ↓ مَقْرُوضٌ:<br>\
(S:) or it is applied to the cud (جِرَّة) of the camel,<br>\
and signifies chewed: or, accord. to Kr, this<br>\
is فَرِيضٌ, with ف. (M.) And hence, accord. to<br>\
some, the saying حَالَ الجَرِيضُ دُونَ القَرِيضِ [explained in art. جرض]: but accord. to others, the<br>\
last word in this saying has the signification next<br>\
but one following. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  The sound, or voice,<br>\
of a man in dying. (Er-Riyáshee, in TA, art.<br>\
جرض.)<br>\
-A3-  (tropical:)  Poetry: (S, M, A, Msb, K:) so<br>\
called for one or another of the reasons mentioned<br>\
under 1, last sentence but one; (A, Msb, TA;)<br>\
of the measure فَعِيلٌ in the sense of the measure<br>\
مَفْعُولٌ: (Msb:) El-Aghlab El-&#39;Ijlee distinguishes<br>\
between it and رَجَز. (IB.)<br>\
قُرَاضَةٌ [Cuttings; clippings; and the like;]<br>\
what falls by the action termed القَرْض; (S, A, *<br>\
Mgh, * K;) as, for instance, of gold, (S, TA,) and<br>\
of silver; and of a garment, or piece of cloth,<br>\
which a tailor cuts with his shears; (TA;)<br>\
and of this last, and of bread, (JK, TA,) &amp;c.,<br>\
(TA,) by the gnawing (قَرْض) of a rat, or mouse:<br>\
(JK, A, Mgh, TA:) pl. قُرَاضَاتٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] أَخَذَ الأَمْرَ بِقُرَاضَتِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He took the thing,<br>\
or affair, in its fresh state. (M, L.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence<br>\
also,] قُرَاضَةُ المَالِ (assumed tropical:)  [The refuse, or] what is bad,<br>\
vile, paltry, or of no account, of property. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  قُرَاضَةٌ also relates to an evil action, and an<br>\
evil saying, which one man directs against<br>\
another. (TA.) [What is meant by this is not<br>\
clear to me.]<br>\
قَرَّاضَةٌ A certain creeping insect (دُوَيْبَّة) that eats<br>\
wool. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [And hence, app.,] (assumed tropical:)  A man who<br>\
defames others, or speaks evil of them, behind their<br>\
backs, or otherwise; syn. مُغْتَابٌ لِلنَّاسِ. (TA.)<br>\
اِبْنُ مِقْرَضٍ, (S, M, A, Msb,) [in one copy of<br>\
the S, ابن مُقْرِضٍ, and in another, ابن مُقَرَّضٍ,]<br>\
like مِقْوَد, (Msb,) [A species of weasel;] a certain<br>\
small beast (دُوَيْبَّة), (S, M, Msb,) called in<br>\
Persian دَلَهٌ, (S, Msb,) or دَلَّهٌ, (as in one copy of<br>\
the S,) whence the arabicized word دَلَقٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
which kills pigeons, (S, M, A,) seizing upon their<br>\
throats, and it is a species of rat; (A;) the longbacked quadruped that kills pigeons: (Lth, O,<br>\
Msb:) this last explanation is given by the author<br>\
of the Bári&#39;, after saying that it is a small beast<br>\
(دويبّة), like the cat, which is in houses, and, when<br>\
angry, gnaws clothes: (Msb:) accord. to some,<br>\
i. q. النِّمْسُ [q. v.]: (Msb:) pl. بَنَاتُ مِقْرَضٍ. (A,<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
مُقَرِّضَاتُ الأَسَاقِى A [kind of] small creeping<br>\
thing (دُوَيْبَّة), which makes holes in, and cuts,<br>\
skins used for water or milk. (M.)<br>\
مِقْرَاضٌ is the sing. of مَقَارِيضُ; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
and a pair thereof is called مِقْرَاضَانِ: (Msb, K:)<br>\
the مِقْرَاض is [A single blade of a pair of shears<br>\
or scissors;] a thing with which one [shears, or<br>\
clips, or] cuts; and when you speak of the two<br>\
together, you do not say مِقْرَاضٌ, as the vulgar<br>\
say, but مِقْرَاضَانِ; (Msb;) which last is syn.<br>\
with جَلَمَانِ [a pair of shears]; a word, accord.<br>\
to the lexicologists having no sing.; but Sb<br>\
mentions مِقْرَاضٌ, thus using the sing. form: (M:)<br>\
or مِقْرَاضٌ and مِقْرَاضَانِ signify the same; [a pair<br>\
of shears;] like جلَمٌ and جَلَمَانِ, and قَلَمٌ and<br>\
قَلَمَانِ: (Msb in art. جلم:) or مِقْرَاضٌ signifies<br>\
جَلَمٌ صَغِيرٌ [a small pair of shears; i. e. a pair of<br>\
scissors]: (JK:) &#39;Adee Ibn-Zeyd uses the expression شَفْرَتَا مِقْرَاضٍ [the two blades of a pair of<br>\
shears or scissors] in a poem; (IB;) and other<br>\
poets use the sing., مقراض: (TA:) and مِفْرَاصٌ,<br>\
with ف and ص, signifies the same. (IB.) Hence<br>\
the saying, لِسَانُ فُلَانِ مِقْرَاضُ الأَعْرَاضِ (tropical:)  [The<br>\
tongue of such a one is the detractor of reputations].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
