قَلَبَهُ, (S, A, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
قَلِبَ,<br>\
(Msb, K.) inf. n. قَلْبٌ, (Msb,) He altered, or<br>\
changed, its, or his, mode, or manner, of being;<br>\
(A, Mgh, Msb, * K;) and ↓ قلّبهُ signifies the<br>\
same, (K,) or is like قَلَبَهُ in the sense expl.<br>\
above and in other senses but denotes intensiveness<br>\
and muchness; (Msb;) and ↓ اقلبهُ also signifies<br>\
the same as قَلَبَهُ in the sense expl. above, (K,) on<br>\
the authority of Lh, but is of weak authority.<br>\
(TA.) Hence, (Mgh,) He inverted it; turned it<br>\
upside-down; turned it so as to make its upper most<br>\
part its undermost; (S, * A, * Mgh, Msb;) namely,<br>\
a thing; (S;) for instance, a [garment of the kind<br>\
called] رِدَآء: (A, * Mgh:) and ↓ قلّبهُ has a similar<br>\
meaning, but [properly] denotes intensiveness and<br>\
muchness. (Msb. See two exs. of the latter<br>\
verb voce قَلَبَةٌ.) And, (A, K,) like ↓ قلّبهُ,<br>\
[except that the latter properly denotes intensiveness and muchness,] (K,) it signifies حَوَّلَهُ ظَهْرًا<br>\
لِبَطْنٍ (A, K) [He turned it over, or upsidedown as meaning so that the upper side became<br>\
the under side; lit. back for belly; accord. to the<br>\
TA, meaning back upon belly (ظَهْرًا عَلَى بَطْنٍ);<br>\
but this is hardly conceivable; whereas the former<br>\
explanation is obviously right in another case:<br>\
(see 5:) and another meaning of قَلَبَهُ and ↓ قُلبهُ,<br>\
i. e. he turned it inside-out, is indicated in the TA by<br>\
its being added, so that he knew what was in it].<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See an ex. voce قَلَابِ. One says, قَلَبَ كَلَامًا<br>\
[meaning He altered, or changed, the order of<br>\
the words of a sentence or the like, by inversion,<br>\
or by any transposition]. (TA.) [And in like<br>\
manner, قَلَبَ كَلِمَةً He altered, or changed, the<br>\
order of the letters of a word, by inversion, or by any<br>\
transposition.] Es-Sakháwee says, in the Expos.<br>\
of the Mufassal, that when they transpose [the<br>\
letters of a word], they do not assign to the [transformed] derivative an inf. n., lest it should be confounded with the original, using only the inf. n.<br>\
of the original that it may be an evidence of the<br>\
originality [of the application of the latter to denote<br>\
the signification common to both]: thus they say<br>\
يَئِسَ, inf. n. يَأْسٌ; and أَيِسَ is مِنْهُ ↓ مَقْلُوبٌ [i. e.<br>\
formed by transposition, or metathesis, from it],<br>\
and has no inf. n.: when the two inf. ns. exist,<br>\
the grammarians decide that each of the two<br>\
verbs is [to be regarded as] an original, and that<br>\
neither is مقلوب from the other, as in the case of<br>\
جَذَبَ and جَبَذَ: but the lexicologists [in general] assert that all such are [of the class termed]<br>\
مقلوب. (Mz, close of the 33rd نوع.) [And<br>\
قَلَبَ likewise signifies He changed, or converted,<br>\
a letter into another letter; the verb in this sense<br>\
being doubly trans.: for ex., one says, قَلَبَ الوَاوَ<br>\
يَآءً He changed, or converted, the و into ى.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And [hence] one says, قَلَبَهُ عَنْ وَجْهِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
turned him [from his manner, way, or course, of<br>\
acting, or proceeding, &amp;c.]: and Lh has mentioned ↓ اقلبهُ [in the same sense], but as being<br>\
disapproved. (TA.) And قَلَبَ الصِّبْيَانَ (tropical:)  He<br>\
(the teacher) turned away [or dismissed] the boys<br>\
to their dwellings: (Th, A, TA:) or sent them<br>\
[away], and returned them, to their abodes: and<br>\
Lh has mentioned ↓ اقلبهم as a dial. var. of weak<br>\
authority, saying that the former verb is that<br>\
which is used by the Arabs in this and other<br>\
[similar] cases. (TA.) And قَلَبْتُ القَوْمَ (assumed tropical:)  I<br>\
turned away [or dismissed] the people, or party;<br>\
(Th, S, O;) like as you say صَرَفْتُ الصِّبْيَانَ.<br>\
(Th, S.) And قَلَبَ اللّٰهُ فُلَانًا إِلَيْهِ (assumed tropical:)  [God translated such a one unto Himself, by death: meaning God took his soul]; as also ↓ اقلبه; (K,<br>\
TA;) whence the saying of Anooshirwán,<br>\
اللّٰهُ مُقْلَبَ أَوْلِيَائِهِ ↓ أَقْلَبَكُمُ (assumed tropical:)  [May God translate<br>\
you with the translating of his favourites (مقلب<br>\
being here an inf. n.), meaning, as He translates<br>\
his favourites]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And قَلَبَ عَيْنَهُ, and<br>\
حِمْلَاقَهُ, (TA,) or حِمْلَاقَ عَيْنِهِ, (A,) [He turned<br>\
about, or rolled, his eye, and therefore the parts<br>\
of his eye that are occasionally covered by the eyelids,] on the occasion of anger, (A, TA,) and of<br>\
threatening. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  قَلَبَ, aor.<br>\
قَلِبَ, inf. n.<br>\
قَلْبٌ; and ↓ اقلب likewise, but this is of weak<br>\
authority, mentioned by Lh; signify also He<br>\
turned over bread, and the like, when the upper<br>\
part thereof was thoroughly baked, in order<br>\
that the under side might become so. (TA.)<br>\
And you say, قَلَبْتُ الإِنَآءَ عَلَى رَأْسِهِ [I turned over<br>\
the vessel upon its head]. (Msb, in explanation<br>\
of كَبَبْتُ الإِنَآءَ.) And قَلَبْتُ الأَرْضَ لِلزِّرَاعَةِ [I<br>\
turned over the earth for sowing]: and ↓ قَلَّبْتُهَا,<br>\
also, I did so much.] (Msb.) And يُقْلَبُ التُّرَابُ<br>\
بِالحَفْرِ [The earth is turned over in digging]:<br>\
whence قَلَبْتُ قَلِيبًا means I dug a well. (A.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
And [hence also] one says, قَلَبْتُ الشَّىْءَ لِلْاِبْتِيَاعِ<br>\
I turned over the thing, or (assumed tropical:)  I examined<br>\
the several parts, or portions, of the thing,<br>\
(تَصَفَّحْتُهُ,) [or I turned over the thing for the<br>\
purpose of examining it,] with a view to purchasing, and saw its outer part or side, and its inner<br>\
part or side: and ↓ قَلَّبْتُهُ, also, I did so much.<br>\
(Msb.) And قَلَبَ السِّلْعَةَ (tropical:)  He (a trafficker)<br>\
examined the commodity, and scrutinized its condition: and ↓ قَلَّبَهَا, also, he did so [much]. (A.)<br>\
And قَلَبَ الدَّابَّةَ and الغُلَامَ (tropical:)  [He examined, &amp;c.,<br>\
the beast, or horse, or the like, and the youth, or<br>\
young man, or male slave]: (A:) and قَلَبَ<br>\
المَمْلُوكَ, aor.<br>\
قَلِبَ, inf. n. قَلْبٌ, (tropical:)  he uncovered and<br>\
examined the male slave, to look at [or to see] his<br>\
defects, on the occasion of purchasing. (O, TA.)<br>\
And قَلَبْتُ الأَمْرَ ظَهْرًا لِبَطْنٍ (assumed tropical:)  I considered [or<br>\
turned over in my mind] what might be the issues,<br>\
or results, of the affair, or case: and ↓ قَلَّبْتُهُ,<br>\
also, I did so much. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  قَلَبٌ signifies<br>\
اِنْقِلابٌ, (S, A, O, K, TA,) meaning A turning<br>\
outward, (TK,) and being flabby, (TA,) of<br>\
the lip, (S, A, O, K,) or of the upper lip, (TA,)<br>\
of a man: (S, A, O, K, TA:) it is the inf. n. of<br>\
قَلِبَت said of the lip (الشَّفَةُ); (TA;) [and also,<br>\
accord. to the TK, of قَلِبَ said of a man as<br>\
meaning His lip had what is termed قَلَبٌ:] and<br>\
hence ↓ أَقْلَبُ as an epithet applied to a man;<br>\
and [its fem.] ↓ قَلْبَآء as an epithet applied to a<br>\
lip. (S, A, O, K, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  قَلَبَهُ, (S, A, O, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
قَلُبَ (Lh, K) and<br>\
قَلِبَ, (K,) He (a man, S, O)<br>\
hit his heart. (S, A, O, K.) And It (a disease)<br>\
affected, or attacked, his heart. (A.) And<br>\
قُلِبَ He (a man) was affected, or attacked, by a<br>\
pain in his heart, (Fr, A, * TA,) from which one<br>\
hardly, or nowise, becomes free. (Fr, TA.) And<br>\
قُلِبَ said of a camel, (As, S, O, K, TA,) inf. n.<br>\
قُلَابٌ, (As, S, TA,) He was attacked by the<br>\
disease called قُلَاب expl. below: (As, S, O, K,<br>\
TA:) or he was attacked suddenly by the [pestilence termed] غُدَّة, and died in consequence.<br>\
(As, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] قَلَبَ النَّخْلَةَ (tropical:)  He plucked<br>\
out the قَلْب, or قُلْب, meaning heart, of the<br>\
palm-tree. (S, A, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And قَلَبَتِ البُسْرَةُ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  The unripe date became red. (S, O, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
قَلَّبَ see 1, first quarter, in four places. You<br>\
say, قَلَّبْتُهُ بِيَدِى [I turned it over and over with<br>\
my hand], inf. n. تَقْلِيبٌ. (S.) [And hence<br>\
several other significations mentioned above.]<br>\
See, again, 1, latter half, in four places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
فَأَصْبَحَ يُقَلِّبُ كَفَّيْهِ, (A, O,) in the Kur [xviii. 40],<br>\
(O,) means فاصبح يقلّب كفّيه ظَهْرًا لِبَطْنٍ [And<br>\
he began to turn his hands upside-down, or to do<br>\
so repeatedly,] in grief, or regret: (Bd:) or (tropical:)  he<br>\
became in the state, or condition, of repenting, or<br>\
grieving: (Ksh, A, O:) for تَقْلِيبُ الكَفَّيْنِ is an<br>\
action of him who is repenting, or grieving;<br>\
(Ksh, O:) and therefore metonymically denotes<br>\
repentance, or grief, like عَضُّ الكَفِّ and السُّقُوطُ<br>\
فِى اليَدِ. (Ksh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [تَقْلِيبُ المَالِ لِغَرَضِ الرِّبْحِ<br>\
occurs in the A, in art. تجر, as an explanation of<br>\
التِّجَارَةُ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  The employing of property, or<br>\
turning it to use, in various ways, for the purpose of<br>\
gain.] And you say, قَلَّبْتُهُ فِى الأَمْرِ, meaning<br>\
صَرَّفْتُهُ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  I employed him to act in whatever<br>\
way he pleased, according to his own judgment or<br>\
discretion or free will, or I made him a free<br>\
agent, in the affair: or I made him, or employed<br>\
him, to practise versatility, or to use art or artifice or cunning, in the affair: and simply, I<br>\
employed him in the managing of the affair]. (K<br>\
in art. صرف.) [And قَلَّبَ الفِكَرَ فِى أمّرٍ (assumed tropical:)  He<br>\
turned over and over, or revolved repeatedly, in<br>\
his mind, thoughts, considerations, or ideas, with<br>\
a view to the attainment of some object, in relation to an affair.] And قلّب الأُمُورَ, (TA,)<br>\
inf. n. تَقْلِيبٌ, (S, K, TA,) (tropical:)  He investigated,<br>\
scrutinized, or examined, affairs, [or turned them<br>\
over and over in his mind, meditating what he<br>\
should do,] and considered what would be their<br>\
results. (TA.) وَقَلَّبُوا لَكَ الأُمُورَ is a phrase occurring in the Kur-án [ix. 48,] (Msb,) and is<br>\
tropical, (A,) meaning (tropical:)  [And they turned over<br>\
and over in their minds affairs, meditating what<br>\
they should do to thee: or] they turned over [repeatedly in their minds] thoughts, or considerations, concerning the beguiling, or circumventing,<br>\
thee, and the rendering thy religion ineffectual]:<br>\
(Jel:) or they meditated, or devised, in relation<br>\
to thee, wiles, artifices, plots, or stratagems; and<br>\
[more agreeably with the primary import of the<br>\
verb] they revolved ideas, or opinions, respecting<br>\
the frustrating of thy affair. (Ksh, Bd.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَقْلَبَ see 1, in six places. [اقلبهُ, said of God,<br>\
also signifies (assumed tropical:)  He made him to return from a<br>\
journey: see an ex. in the first paragraph of art.<br>\
صحب. (In the phrase أَقْبِلْنَا بِذِمَّةٍ, expl. in the<br>\
TA in art. دم as meaning Restore us to our<br>\
family in safety, أَقْبِلْنَا is a mistranscription for<br>\
أَقْلِبْنَا.)]<br>\
-A2-  اقلب as intrans., said of bread [and<br>\
the like], It became fit to be turned over [in<br>\
order that the other side might become thoroughly<br>\
baked]. (S, O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And اقلب العِنَبُ The<br>\
grapes became dry, or tough, externally, (K,<br>\
TA,) and were therefore turned over, or shifted.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also He had his camels attacked by the<br>\
disease called قُلَاب. (S, O, K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تقلّب الشَّىْءُ ظَهْرًا لبِطْنٍ [The thing turned<br>\
over and over, or upside-down as meaning so that<br>\
the upper side became the under side, (lit. back<br>\
for belly,) doing so much, or repeatedly], like as<br>\
does the serpent upon the ground vehemently<br>\
heated by the sun. (S, O, TA.) تقلّب said of<br>\
a man&#39;s face [&amp;c.] signifies تصرّف [i. e. It turned<br>\
about, properly meaning much, or in various<br>\
ways or directions; or it was, or became, turned<br>\
about, &amp;c.]. (Jel in ii. 139.) And تَتَقَلَّبُ فِيهِ<br>\
الْقُلُوبُ وَالْأَبْصَارُ, in the Kur [xxiv. 37], means<br>\
In which the hearts and the eyes shall be in a<br>\
state of commotion, or agitation, by reason of<br>\
fear, (Zj, Jel, TA,) and impatience; (Zj, TA;)<br>\
the hearts between safety and perdition, and the<br>\
eyes between the right side and the left. (Jel.)<br>\
And فِى تَقَلُّبِهِمْ, in the Kur xvi. 48, means (assumed tropical:)  In<br>\
their journeyings for traffic. (Jel. [See also<br>\
the Kur iii. 196, and xl. 4.]) You say, تقلّب<br>\
فِى البِلَادِ, (TA,) and فى الأُمُورِ, (K, TA,) meaning تَصَرَّفَ فِيهَا كَيْفَ شَآءَ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  He acted in<br>\
whatsoever way he pleased, according to his own<br>\
judgment or discretion or free will, or as a free<br>\
agent, in journeying, for traffic or otherwise, in<br>\
the country, and in the disposal, or management,<br>\
of affairs: and simply, he employed himself in<br>\
journeying, for traffic or otherwise, in the country,<br>\
and in the disposal, or management, of affairs:<br>\
or تقلّب فى الامور means he practised versatility,<br>\
or used art or artifice or cunning, in the disposal,<br>\
or management, of affairs]. (K, * TA.) And<br>\
هُوَ يَتَقَلَّبُ فِى أَعْمَالِ السُّلْطَانِ (tropical:)  He acts as he<br>\
pleases, &amp;c., or simply he employs himself, in the<br>\
offices of administration, or in the provinces, of<br>\
the Sultán]. (A.)<br>\
7<br>\
انقلب, of which مُنْقَلَبٌ is an inf. n., (S, O,<br>\
K, TA,) syn. with اِنقِلَابٌ, (TA,) and also a n.<br>\
of place, (S, O, K, TA,) like مُنْصَرَفٌ, (S, O,<br>\
TA,) is quasi-pass. of قَلَبْتُهُ: (S, O:) it signifies<br>\
It, or he, was, or became, altered, or changed,<br>\
from its, or his, mode, or manner, of being:<br>\
(TA:) [and hence,] it (a thing) became inverted, or turned upside-down [&amp;c.: see 1]. (S.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence] الاِنْقِلَابُ إِلَى اللّٰهِ means (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
transition, and the being translated, or removed,<br>\
to God, by death: and [in like manner] المُنْقَلَبُ<br>\
means the transition [&amp;c.], of men, to the final<br>\
abode. (TA. [See an ex. in p. 132, sec. col.,<br>\
from the Kur xxvi. last verse.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  And الاِنْقِلَابُ<br>\
means also (assumed tropical:)  The returning, in an absolute sense:<br>\
and, as also المُنْقَلَبُ, particularly, from a<br>\
journey, and to one&#39;s home: thus, in a trad., in<br>\
the prayer relating to journeying, أُعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ<br>\
كَآبَةِ المُنْقَلَبِ (assumed tropical:)  [I seek protection by Thee from<br>\
the being in an evil state in respect of the returning from my journeying to my home]; i. e., from<br>\
my returning to my dwelling and seeing what<br>\
may grieve me. (TA.) The saying in the<br>\
Kur xxii. 11 وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ انْقَلَبَ عَلَى وَجْهِهِ<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  And if trial befall him, and [particularly<br>\
such as] disease in himself and his cattle, he returns [to his former way, i. e., in this case,] to<br>\
infidelity. (Jel. [See also other exs. in the<br>\
Kur in ii. 138 and iii. 138.]) And one says,<br>\
انقلب عَنِ العَهْدِ [meaning (assumed tropical:)  He withdrew, or<br>\
receded, from the covenant, compact, agreement,<br>\
or engagement]. (S in art. حول.) [See also an<br>\
ex. from the Kur-án (lxvii. 4) voce خَاسِئٌ.]<br>\
قَلْبٌ The heart; syn. فُؤَادٌ: (Lh, T, S, M, O,<br>\
Msb, K, &amp;c.:) or [accord. to some] it has a more<br>\
special signification than the latter word: (O,<br>\
K:) [for] some say that فؤاد signifies the “ appendages of the مَرِىْء [or œsophagus], consisting<br>\
of the liver and lungs and قَلْب [or heart]: ” (K<br>\
in art. فأد:) [and, agreeably with this assertion,]<br>\
it is said that the قلب is a lump of flesh, pertaining to the فؤاد, suspended to the نِيَاط [q. v.]: Az<br>\
says, I have observed that some of the Arabs<br>\
call the whole flesh of the قلب, its fat, and its<br>\
حِجَاب [or septum?], قَلْب and فُؤَاد; and I have<br>\
not observed them to distinguish between the<br>\
two [words]; but I do not deny that the [word]<br>\
قلب may be [applied by some to] the black clot<br>\
of blood in its interior: MF mentions that فؤاد<br>\
is said to signify the “ receptacle,” or “ covering,” of the heart, (وِعَآءُ القَلْبِ, or غِشَاؤُهُ, [i. e. the<br>\
pericardium,]) or, accord. to some, its “ interior: ”<br>\
the قَلْب is said to be so called from its تَقَلُّب:<br>\
[see 5:] the word is of the masc. gender: and the<br>\
pl. is قُلُوبٌ. (TA.) بَنَاتُ القَلْبِ means (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
several parts, or portions, [or, perhaps, appertenances,] of the heart. (TA in art. بنى.)<br>\
[And قَلْبٌ is also used as meaning The stomach,<br>\
which is often thus termed in the present day:<br>\
so, for ex., in an explanation of طَنِخ, q. v.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
قَلْبُ العَقْرَبِ (also called simply, القَلْبُ, Kzw) is<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A certain bright star, [the star a in Scorpio,]<br>\
between two other stars, which is one of the Mansions of the Moon, (S, O,) namely, the Eighteenth<br>\
Mansion; so called because it is in the heart of<br>\
Scorpio: (MF:) [it rose aurorally, about the<br>\
commencement of the era of the Flight, in<br>\
Central Arabia, together with النَّسْرُ الوَقِعُ (a<br>\
of Libra) on the 25th of November, O. S.: (see<br>\
مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل:)] the commencement of<br>\
the period when the cattle breed in the desert is<br>\
at the time of its [auroral] rising and the<br>\
[auroral] rising of النسر الواقع; these two stars<br>\
rising together, in the cold season: the Arabs<br>\
say, القَلبْ جَآءَ الشِّتَآءُ كَالْكَلْبْ [When the<br>\
heart of the Scorpion rises, the winter comes like<br>\
the dog]: and they regard its نَوْء [q. v.] as unlucky; and dislike journeying when the moon is<br>\
in Scorpio: at its نَوْء [meaning auroral rising],<br>\
the cold becomes vehement, cold winds blow,<br>\
and the sap becomes stagnant in the trees: its<br>\
رَقِيب is الدَّبَرَانُ [q. v.] (Kzw.) There are also<br>\
three similar appellations of other stars: these<br>\
are قَلْبُ الأَسَدِ (assumed tropical:)  [Cor Leonis, or Regulus, the<br>\
star a of Leo]: قَلْبُ الثَّوْرِ, an [improper] appellation of الدَّبَرَانُ: and قَلْبُ الحُوتِ, a name of<br>\
الرِّشَآءُ [q. v.]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And القَلْبُ is syn. with<br>\
الضَّمِيرُ [signifying (assumed tropical:)  The heart as meaning the<br>\
mind or the secret thoughts]. (Msb in art. ضمر.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And (assumed tropical:)  The soul. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And (assumed tropical:)  The mind,<br>\
meaning the intellect, or intelligence. (Fr, S, O,<br>\
Msb, K.) So in the Kur l. 36: (Fr, S, O,<br>\
TA:) or it means there endeavour to understand,<br>\
and consideration. (TA.) Accord. to Fr, you<br>\
may say, مَا لَكَ قَلْبٌ (assumed tropical:)  Thou hast no intellect, or<br>\
intelligence: (TA:) and مَا قَلْبُكَ مَعَكَ (assumed tropical:)  Thine intellect is not present with thee: (O, TA:) and<br>\
أَيْنَ ذَهَبَ قَلْبُكَ (assumed tropical:)  Whither has thine intellect gone?<br>\
(TA.) [And hence, أَفْعَالُ القُلُوبِ (assumed tropical:)  The verbs<br>\
significant of operations of the mind; as ظَنَّ,<br>\
and the like.] ―<br>\
-b6-  See also قُلْبٌ. ―<br>\
-b7-  [قَلْبُ الجَيْشِ<br>\
means (assumed tropical:)  The main body of the army; as distinguished from the van and the rear and the two<br>\
wings: mentioned in the S and K in art. خمس;<br>\
&amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b8-  And قَلْبٌ signifies also (assumed tropical:)  The pure, or<br>\
choice, or best, part of anything. (L, K, * TA.) It is<br>\
said in a trad. إِنَّ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَلْبًا وَقَلْبُ القُرْآنِ يٰس<br>\
(tropical:)  [as though meaning, Verily to everything there<br>\
is a choice, or best, part; and the choice, or best,<br>\
part of the Kur-án is Yá-Seen (the Thirty-sixth<br>\
Chapter)]: (A, O, L, TA:) it is a saying of the<br>\
Prophet; [and may (perhaps better) be rendered,<br>\
verily to everything there is a pith; and the pith<br>\
&amp;c.; from قَلْبٌ, as meaning, like قُلْبٌ, the<br>\
“ pith ” of the palm-tree; but,] accord. to Lth,<br>\
it is from what here immediately follows. (O.)<br>\
One says, جِئْتُكَ بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ قَلْبًا, meaning (tropical:)  I have<br>\
come to thee with this affair unmixed with any<br>\
other thing. (A, * O, L, TA.) ―<br>\
-b9-  Also (tropical:)  A man<br>\
genuine, or pure, in respect of origin, or lineage;<br>\
(S, A, O, K;) holding a middle place among his<br>\
people; (A;) and ↓ قُلْبٌ signifies the same: (O,<br>\
K:) the former is used alike as masc. and fem.<br>\
and sing. and dual and pl.; but it is allowable to<br>\
form the fem. and dual and pl. from it: (S, O:)<br>\
