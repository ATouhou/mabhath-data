former is the more usual, or common; (M, TA;)<br>\
inf. n. قَرَارٌ, (S, M, Mgh, K,) of both verbs, (S,)<br>\
or this is a simple subst., (Msb,) and قُرُورٌ, (S, M,<br>\
K,) of the former verb, (S,) and قَرٌّ (M, Msb,<br>\
K) and تَقِرَّةٌ, (M, K,) which last is anomalous, (M,)<br>\

syn. ثَبَتَ وَسَكَنَ, (K,) and تَمَكَّنَ [which, when<br>\

In the words of the Kur, [xxxiii. 33,] وَقِرْنَ فِى<br>\
بُيُوتِكُنَّ, and وَقَرْنَ, [And remain ye in your<br>\
houses, or chambers,] قِرْنَ and قَرْنَ are contractions of اِقْرِرْنَ and اِقْرَرْنَ like as ظِلْنَ and<br>\
ظَلْنَ are contractions of اِظْلِلْنَ and اِظْلَلْنَ: (M,<br>\
Bd, * TA: * [but see ظَلَّ:]) or قِرْنَ is from وَقَرَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
قَرِ3َ, inf. n. وَقَارٌ; (Bd, TA; *) and قَرْنَ from<br>\
قَارَ, aor. يَقَارُ, signifying اِجْتَمَعَ. (Bd.) It is<br>\
said in a proverb, اِبْدَأْهُمْ بِالصُّرَاخِ يَقِرُّوا [Begin<br>\
thou by crying out to them, and they will become<br>\
still, or quiet; or] begin thou by complaining of<br>\
them, and they will be content to be still, or<br>\
quiet. (TA.) [But see Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov.,<br>\
i. 173, where, instead of يَقِرُّوا, we find يَفِرُّوا.]<br>\
You also say فِى مَكَانِهِ ↓ فُلَانٌ مَا يَتَقَارُّ, i. e. ↓ مَا يَسْتَقِرُّ<br>\
[Such a one does not rest, or remain, in his<br>\
place]. (S.) And it is said in a trad. of Aboo-Dharr, أَنْ قُمْتُ ↓ فَلَمْ أَتَقَارَّ And I did not delay to<br>\
rise, or stand up. (TA.) You say also, of a<br>\
woman, تَقِرُّ لِمَا يُصْنَعُ بِهَا (K) She suffers quietly<br>\
what is done to her, such as the being kissed, &amp;c.<br>\
(K. * TA.) And مَآءُ الفَحْلِ فِى الرَّحِمِ ↓ اِقْتَرَّ The<br>\
seed of the stallion rested, or remained, in the<br>\

-A2-  قَرَّ, (S,<br>\

(Msb,) [so that the second pers. is قَرِرْتَ,] aor.<br>\

قَرَرْتَ or قَرُرْتَ,] aor.<br>\
قَرُ3َ; (Lh, M, K;) or, accord.<br>\
to MF, Lh mentions the aors.<br>\
قَرُ3َ and<br>\
قَرِ3َ in his<br>\
Nawádir; and IKtt, the three forms of aor., and<br>\
so the author of the Ma&#39;álim; but IKtt says, in<br>\
his Kitáb el-Abniyeh, يَقَرُّ and يَقِرُّ, though he<br>\
may have mentioned the three forms in another<br>\
book; and accord. to what is stated [in the M<br>\
and] in the L, Lh says يَقُرُّ and يَقَرُّ, which is a<br>\
rare form; (TA;) [on which it should be<br>\
remarked, that ISd, IKtt, and Mtr, mention the<br>\
form<br>\
قَرَ3َ first, as though to indicate its being the<br>\
more, or most, common;] inf. n. قَرٌّ, (Msb,) or<br>\
قُرٌّ, (IKtt, TA,) or the latter is a simple subst.;<br>\
(Msb;) It (the day, Lh, S, M, &amp;c., and in like<br>\
manner one says of the night, قَرّتِ اللَّيْلَةُ, M)<br>\
was, or became, cold. (Lh, S, M, &amp;c.) ―<br>\
-b2-  قُرَّ He<br>\
(a man) was, or became, affected, or smitten, by<br>\
the cold. But you do not say قَرَّهُ اللّٰهُ: instead of<br>\
this you say ↓ أَقَرَّهُ. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It is said in a<br>\
trad. respecting the war of the Moat, فَلَمَّا أَخْبَرْتُهُ<br>\
خَبَرَ القَوْمِ وَقَرِرْتُ قَرَرْتُ, meaning, And when I<br>\
[acquainted him with the tidings of the people,<br>\
and] became quiet, I experienced cold. (TA.)<br>\
[But perhaps the last word should be قُرِرْتُ.] ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
قَرَّتْ عَيْنُهُ, (S, M, IKtt, Msb, K,) of the measure<br>\
فَعِلَتْ, (M,) like تَعِبَتْ, (Msb,) [second pers.<br>\
قَرِرْتِ,] aor.<br>\
قَرَ3َ, (S, M, IKtt, K,) which is the<br>\
more usual form; (M;) and قَرِّتْ, like ضَرَبَتْ,<br>\
(Msb,) [second pers. قَرَرْتِ,] aor.<br>\
قَرِ3َ; (S, M, IKtt,<br>\
K;) inf. n. قُرَّةٌ, (Th, M, Msb, K,) said by Th to<br>\
be an inf. n., (M,) and قَرَّةٌ (M, K) and قُرُورٌ;<br>\
(M, Msb, K;) (tropical:)  His eye was, or became, cool,<br>\
or refrigerated, or refreshed; contr. of سَخِنَتْ;<br>\
(S, M;) wherefore some prefer that قَرَّتْ should<br>\
be of the measure فَعِلَتْ, to agree in measure<br>\
with its contr.: (M:) or became cool, &amp;c., by<br>\
reason of happiness, or joy: (Msb:) or became<br>\
cool, &amp;c., and ceased to weep, (M, K,) and to feel<br>\
hot with tears; (M;) for the tear of happiness,<br>\
or joy, is cool; and that of sorrow, or grief, is<br>\
hot: (S:) [it may therefore be rendered, his eye<br>\
was, or became, unheated by tears:] or it is from<br>\
القَرَارُ, and means, his eye, seeing that for which it<br>\
longed, became at rest, and slept. (M, K. *)<br>\
You also say قَرِرْتُ بِهِ عَيْنًا, and قَرَرْتُ بِهِ عَيْنًا,<br>\
inf. n., of both forms, قُرَّةٌ and قُرُورٌ, (tropical:)  I was, or<br>\
became, cool, or refrigerated, or refreshed, in eye<br>\
thereby. (S.) See also 4.<br>\
-A3-  قَرَّهُ, aor.<br>\
قَرُ3َ, inf. n.<br>\
قَرٌّ, He poured it; poured it out, or forth;<br>\
namely, water: and he poured it, or poured it<br>\
out or forth, at once. (TA.) You say قَرَّ عَلَيْهِ<br>\
المَآءَ He poured the water upon him. (M, K.)<br>\
And قَرَرْتُ عَلَى رَأْسِهِ ذَنُوبًا مِنْ مَآءٍ بَارِدٍ I poured<br>\
upon his head a bucket of cold water. (S.) And<br>\
قَرَّ المَآءَ فِى الإِنَآءِ He poured the water into the<br>\
vessel. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) قَرَّ الكَلَامَ فِى أُذُنِهِ,<br>\
(Sh, M, K,) and الحَدِيثَ, (S,) aor.<br>\
قَرُ3َ, (Sh, S,<br>\
M,) inf. n. قَرٌّ, (Sh, S, M, K,) (tropical:)  He poured forth<br>\
the speech, or discourse, or narration, into his<br>\
ear: (M, K:) or he did as though he poured it<br>\
into his ear: (S:) or he intrusted him with it:<br>\
(TA:) or he spoke it secretly into his ear: (M, *<br>\
K, * TA:) or he repeated it in his ear, meaning<br>\
the ear of a dumb man (أَبْكَم), that he might<br>\
understand it: (IAar:) or he put his mouth to<br>\
his ear and spoke loudly to him, as one does to a<br>\
deaf man. (Sh.)<br>\
2<br>\
قَرَّ3َ see 4, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  قَرَّرَهُ بِهِ, inf. n. تَقْرِيرٌ,<br>\
He made him to acknowledge, or confess, it. (S.)<br>\
You say قَرَّرَهُ بِالْحَقِّ, (S,) and عَلَى الحقِّ, (M,<br>\
K,) حَتَّى أَقَرَّ, (S,) He made him to acknowledge<br>\
the truth, or right, or due, (S, M, K,) so that he<br>\
did acknowledge it. (S.)<br>\

قَارَّهُ, inf. n. مُقَارَّةٌ, He settled, became fixed<br>\
or established or motionless or quiet or still or at<br>\
rest, rested, remained, or continued, with him.<br>\
(S, K.) You say أَنَا لَا أُقَارُّكَ عَلَى مَا أَنْتَ عَلَيْهِ I<br>\
will not settle, &amp;c., with thee in the state in which<br>\
thou art. (TA.) And hence the saying of Ibn-Mes&#39;ood, قَارُّوا الصَّلَاةَ, (S, * K,) from القَرَارُ, not<br>\
from الوَقَارُ, (S,) meaning, Be ye still, without<br>\
motion, and without play, during prayer. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
اقرّه, (S, M, K,) and ↓ قرّرهُ, (M, K,) He<br>\
settled, fixed, established or confirmed, him, or it;<br>\
rendered him, or it, motionless, quiet, still, or at<br>\
rest; made him, or it, to rest, remain, or con-<br>\
tinue; (S, * M, * K;) فِيهِ [in it, namely, a place,<br>\
or the like], and عَلَيْهِ [in it, namely, a state, an<br>\
office, or the like]. (M, K.) You say اقرّهُ فى مَكَانِهِ<br>\
[He settled, fixed, established, or confirmed, &amp;c.,<br>\
him, or it, in his, or its, place]. (S, K.) And مَا<br>\
أَقَرَّنِى فِى هٰذَا البَلَدِ إِلَّا مَكَانُكَ [Nothing fixed me<br>\
in this country, or town, &amp;c., but thy being in it].<br>\
(TA.) And اقرّ الطَّيْرَ فِى وَكْرِهِ He left the birds<br>\
to rest in their nest. (Msb.) And اقرّ العَامِلَ<br>\
عَلَى عَمَلِهِ He left the agent to rest, [or settled,<br>\
fixed, or established, him, or made him to<br>\
continue, or confirmed him,] in his agency.<br>\
(Msb.) [And اقرّهُ عَلَى قَوْلِهِ He left him at rest<br>\
in his assertion, undisturbed, unopposed, or uncontradicted; he confirmed him in it; he confessed him to be correct respecting it. Thus the<br>\
verb is used in the phrase اقرّهُ عَلَى ذٰلِكَ in the<br>\
Expos. of the Jel., xxxviii. 22: and in many<br>\
other instances.] You say also الشَّىْءَ ↓ قرّر, inf. n.<br>\
تَقْرِيرٌ, meaning, He put the thing in its قَرَار [or<br>\
resting-place]. (S.) And قَرَّرْتُ عِنْدَهُ الخَبَرَ حَتَّى<br>\

so that it became established]. (S.) And أَقْرَرْتُ<br>\

inf. ns. properly belong to the synonymous form<br>\
قَرَّرْتُ, (as Lumsden has remarked, in his Arabic<br>\
Grammar, page 241,) I settled, fixed, established,<br>\
&amp;c., this thing, or affair; or I confirmed it.]<br>\
(S.) And it is said in a trad. of &#39;Othmán,<br>\
أَقِرُّوا الأَنْفُسَ حَتَّى تَزْهَقَ Make ye the souls of the<br>\
beasts which ye slaughter to become at rest,<br>\
[and wait ye] that they may depart, and do not<br>\
hasten to skin the beasts, nor to cut them in<br>\
pieces. (TA.) And in a trad. of Aboo-Moosà,<br>\
أُقِرَّتْ الصَّلَاةُ بِالْبِرِّ والزَّكَاةِ Prayer is established<br>\
and connected with برّ and زكاة [i. e., benevolent<br>\
treatment of others or piety or obedience to God,<br>\
and the giving of the alms required by the law].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  أَقْرَرْتُ الكَلَامَ لِفُلَانٍ I explained the saying, or speech, or language, to such a one, so that he<br>\
knew it. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  أَقَرَّ He became quiet and submissive. (TA, from a trad.)<br>\
-A3-  اقرّ بِهِ, (S, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. إِقْرَارٌ, (M, K,) He acknowledged, or confessed, it, (S, M, Msb, K,) namely, the truth, or<br>\
a right, or due, (S, M, K,) or a thing. (Msb.)<br>\
إِقْرَارٌ signifies The affirming a thing either with<br>\
the tongue or with the mind, or with both. (ElBasáïr.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence, app.,] أَقَرَّتِ النَّاقَةُ, [as though<br>\
signifying The she-camel acknowledged, or confessed, herself to be pregnant;] the she-camel&#39;s<br>\
pregnancy became apparent: (IKtt, TA;) or<br>\
became established; became a positive fact:<br>\
(ISk, S, K:) or the she-camel conceived; became<br>\
pregnant. (IAar.)<br>\
-A4-  اقرّ He entered upon a<br>\
time of cold. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اقرّهُ اللّٰهُ, (inf. n. إِقْرَارٌ,<br>\
Msb,) God caused him to be affected, or smitten,<br>\
by the cold. (S, * M, Msb, K.) One does not<br>\
say قَرَّهُ (M, K) ―<br>\
-b3-  اقرّ اللّٰهُ عَيْنُهُ, (S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
and بِعَيْنِهِ, (M, K,) (tropical:)  God made his eye to become<br>\
cool, or refrigerated, or refreshed, (Msb, TA,) by<br>\
happiness, or joy, in consequence of his having<br>\
offspring, or of some other event: (Msb:) or<br>\
cooled his tears; for the tear of happiness, or joy,<br>\
is cool: (As:) or gave him to such an extent<br>\
that his eye became quiet (حَتَّى تَقَرَّ), and was not<br>\
raised towards him who was above him, (S, TA,)<br>\
or towards that which was above it: (L:) or<br>\
caused him to meet with that which contented<br>\
him, so that his eye became quiet (تَقَرَّ) in looking<br>\
at other things; an explanation approved and<br>\
adopted by Abu-l-&#39;Abbás: (L, TA:) or caused<br>\
his eye to sleep, by making him to meet with<br>\
happiness, or joy, that dispelled his sleeplessness.<br>\
(Aboo-Tálib.) You say also يُقِرُّ بِعَيْنِى أَنْ أَرَاكَ<br>\
[It refreshes my eye, &amp;c., to see thee]. (TA.)<br>\

10<br>\
إِسْتَقْرَ3َ see 1, first signification, in three places; and<br>\
see 4. [―<br>\
-b2-  استقرّ often signifies It was, or subsisted,<br>\
or had being: and hence مُسْتَقِرٌّ is frequently used or<br>\
understood as a copula, often with بِ prefixed to<br>\
the predicate; as is also يَسْتَقِرُّ; so that رَيْدٌ مُسْتَقِرٌّ<br>\
عِنْدَكَ or يَسْتَقِرُّ عندك may mean Zeyd is with<br>\
thee; as well as Zeyd is residing, &amp;c., with thee.<br>\
See, on this point, I &#39;Ak, p. 58.) ―<br>\

It (wine, or beverage,) sounded, [or gurgled,] in a<br>\
man&#39;s throat. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He laughed (S, M,<br>\
K) in a certain manner, (S,) violently, or immoderately, and reiterating his voice in his<br>\

laughing: (IKtt:) or قَرْقَرَ is similar to قَهْقَهَ.<br>\
(Sh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He (a camel) brayed, (S, M, K,) with<br>\
a clear and reiterated voice: (S, M:) or brayed<br>\
in the best manner: (IKtt:) said only of a camel<br>\
advanced in age: (S, in art. نقض:) قَرْقَرَةٌ is the<br>\
inf. n., (S, * M, K, *) and the simple subst. is<br>\
قَرْقَارٌ: (M, K:) and قَرَاقِرُ is pl. of the former of<br>\
these ns. (S.) ―<br>\
-b5-  قَرْقَرَتْ It (a pigeon, حَمَامَة,)<br>\
[cooed; or] uttered its cry: (S, K:) or uttered a<br>\
hind of cry: (M:) the inf. n. is قَرْقَرَةٌ and قَرْقَرِيرٌ,<br>\
(S, M, K,) which latter IJ says is of the<br>\
measure فَعْلَلِيْلٌ, thus making it a quadriliteralradical word, (M,) and قَرْقَارٌ and قَرْقَارٌ, which<br>\
last is a simple subst. as well as an inf. n., and<br>\
so is قَرْقرَةٌ. (El-Hasan Ibn-&#39;Abd-Allah El-Kátib<br>\
El-Isbahánee.) ―<br>\
-b6-  She (a domestic hen) uttered<br>\
a reiterated cry, or cackling. (Hr, M.)<br>\

-b2-  يَوْمُ القَرِّ [The day of<br>\
resting;] the eleventh day of Dhu-l-Hijjeh;<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd;) the first of the days called أَيَّامُ<br>\
التَّشْرِيقِ; (Msb;) the day next after that called<br>\
يَوْمُ النَّحْرِ [or the day of the sacrifice, or of the<br>\
slaughtering of camels]: (S, M, Mgh, K:) so<br>\
called because the people on that day rest, or<br>\
settle, in their abodes: (S, M, Mgh:) or because<br>\
they rest on that day in [the valley of] Minè,<br>\

A cold chill, or cool, day, and night: (S, M, &amp;c.:)<br>\
and قَرٌّ is applied to anything as signifying cold;<br>\
(TA;) [and so, app., ↓ قَارٌّ, and perhaps ↓ قَرُورٌ and<br>\
↓ قَرِيرٌ]. [Hence,] القَرَّتَانِ [The two cold times;]<br>\
the morning and the evening. (S, K.) A man<br>\
being asked what had caused his teeth to fall<br>\
out, he answered ↓ أَكْلُ الحَارِّ وَشُرْبُ القَارِّ [The<br>\
eating what was hot, and drinking what was<br>\
cold: but he may have used قَارّ instead of قرّ for<br>\
the purpose of assimilation to حارّ; and it seems<br>\
that, when coupled or connected with حَارٌّ, قَارٌّ is<br>\
more chaste than قَرٌّ]. (TA.) Respecting the<br>\
saying وَلِّ حَارَّهَا مَنْ تَوَلَّى قَارَّهَا, see art. حر.<br>\
-A3-<br>\
See also قُرٌّ.<br>\
قُرٌّ i. q. قَرَارٌ [q. v.] (S, M, K) and مُسْتَقَرٌّ (TA)<br>\

-A2-  Also, (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K,) and<br>\
↓ قَرٌّ, (Lh, Kt,) which latter form, it is said, must<br>\
be used in conjunction with [its contr.] حَرٌّ, for<br>\
the sake of assimilation, (TA,) and ↓ قِرٌّ, (Kt,)<br>\
Cold; coldness; chill; chilness; coolness; syn.<br>\
بَرْدٌ; (S, M, Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ قِرَّةٌ: (S:)<br>\

whereas بَرْدٌ is in winter and summer: (M:) and<br>\
↓ قِرَّةٌ, cold, &amp;c., by which a man (M, K) or other<br>\
creature, (M,) is affected, or smitten. (M, K.)<br>\
You say دَخَلُوا فِى القُرِّ They entered upon the<br>\
[time of] cold. (M.) And لَا حَرَّ وَلَا قَرَّ Neither<br>\
heat nor cold. (TA, from a trad.) And لَيْلَةٌ<br>\
↓ ذَاتُ قِرَّةٍ A night of cold. (TA.) And اشدُّ<br>\
↓ العَطَشِ حِرَّةٌ عَلَى قِرَّةٌ (S) The most severe of thirst<br>\
is thirst in a cold day. (S, art. حر.) And<br>\
sometimes the Arabs said ↓ أَجِدُ حِرَّةٌ تَحْتَ قِرَّةٌ (S)<br>\
[I experience] thirst in a cold day. (ISd, in<br>\
TA, art. حر.) [See this and other exs. in art.<br>\
حر.) One says also ↓ ذَهَبَتْ قِرَّتُهَا, [meaning قِرَّةٌ<br>\
العِلَّةِ,] The time of its access, or coming, meaning of the access, or coming, of the disease, [app.,<br>\
of the shivering-fit of an ague, (see عُرَوَآءُ,)]<br>\
departed: the [pronoun] ها refers to [the word]<br>\

قِرٌّ: see قُرٌّ.<br>\
لقَرَّتَانِ: see قَرٌّ.<br>\
قُرَّةُ العَيْنِ signifies مَا قَرَّتْ بِهِ العَيْنُ (tropical:)  [That by<br>\
which, or in consequence of which, the eye becomes<br>\
cool, or refrigerated, or refreshed; &amp;c.; or in<br>\
consequence of which it becomes at rest, and sleeps:<br>\
see 1]. (M, K.) In the Kur, xxxii. 17, instead<br>\
of قُرَّةَ أَعْيُنٍ, Aboo-Hureyreh reads قُرَّاتِ أَعْيُنٍ, as<br>\
on the authority of the Prophet. (M.) You say<br>\
also هُوَ فِى قُرَّةٍ مِنَ العَيْشِ (tropical:)  He is in a plentiful<br>\
and pleasant state of life. (TA.)<br>\
قِرَّةٌ: see قُرٌّ, throughout.<br>\

38,] And the sun runneth to a place, and time,<br>\
beyond which it doth not pass: or to a term appointed for it: (TA:) or to a determined limit,<br>\
where its revolution ends; likened to the مستقرّ of<br>\
a traveller, when he ends his journey: or to the<br>\
middle of the sky; for it there seems to pause: or<br>\
to its state of settledness, &amp;c., according to a<br>\
special path: or to its appointed end in one of the<br>\
different places of rising and setting which it has<br>\
on different days: or to the end of its course, in<br>\
the desolate part of the world: and accord. to<br>\
other readings, لَا مُسْتَقَرَّ لَهَا, and لَا مُسْتَقَرٌّ لَهَا,<br>\

existence, and such as is deposited in the back, not<br>\
yet created: or and there is of you such as remains among the living, and such as is deposited<br>\
in the earth [among the dead]: (M, TA:) or<br>\
such as hath been born and hath appeared upon<br>\
the earth, and such as is in the womb: (Lth, TA:)<br>\

of the consecrated places of abode: مَقَارُّ is pl. of<br>\

↓ بِقُرِّهِ, i. e. ↓ بِمُسْتَقَرِّهِ [the thing fell in the place<br>\
where it did, or should, rest, or remain]: (As:) and<br>\
one says to a man who seeks blood-revenge, when<br>\
he meets the slayer of his relation, ↓ وَقَعْتَ بِقُرِّكَ thy<br>\
heart has met that which it looked for. (TA.)<br>\
↓ لَقَدْ وَقَعْتُ بِقُرِّكَ, and ↓ بِقُحَاحِ قُرِّكَ, also means I<br>\
have become acquainted with all that thou knowest,<br>\

prov., meaning, الى أَصْلِكَ وَجَهْدِكَ [i. e. I will<br>\

[vessels] white as silver and clear as قوارير.<br>\

vessel of glass because of her weakness. (Msb.)<br>\
Hence the words [of Mohammad] in a trad.,<br>\
رُوَيْدَكَ رِفْقًا بِالْقَوَارِيرِ [Go thou leisurely: act gently<br>\
with the قَوَارير]: women being here likened to<br>\
قوارير of glass because of their weakness of purpose, and their fickleness; for such vessels are<br>\
soon broken and cannot be restored to soundness:<br>\
meaning, that the man thus addressed, named<br>\
أَنْجَشَة (Anjesheh), [a freedman of Mohammad,]<br>\
should not raise his voice and sing in driving the<br>\
camels, for fear of the women&#39;s having their<br>\
desires excited by what they heard; or for fear<br>\
that the camels, hearing the singing, should go<br>\
quickly, and jolt and fatigue the riders. (TA.)<br>\
مَقَرٌّ: see قَرَارٌ, in three places.<br>\
مُقِرٌّ A she-camel whose pregnancy is established:<br>\
(TA:) or that has condensed and retained the<br>\
seed of the stallion in her womb, (M, K,) and not<br>\

K:) from أَقَرَّهُ اللّٰهُ, contr. to rule; as though<br>\
formed from قُرَّ. (S.) [It seems that J was not<br>\
acquainted with the form قُرَّ, which is mentioned<br>\
in the M and K, or that he did not allow it.] ―<br>\
