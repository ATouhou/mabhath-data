قَمِحَهُ, (S, A, L, K,) aor.<br>\
قَمَحَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
قَمْحٌ; (S;) and ↓ اقتمحهُ; (S, A, L, K;) He<br>\
ate it, or took it into his mouth, (S, K,) namely,<br>\
meal of parched barley or wheat, &amp;c., (S, A, L,)<br>\
not bread nor dates nor the like, but only what<br>\
is eaten in the manner termed سَفٌّ, (L,) without<br>\
moistening it, or kneading it with water &amp;c.; syn.<br>\
اِسْتَفَّهُ; (S, K;) he took it in the palm of his hand<br>\
(A, L) [and conveyed it] to his mouth (A) or<br>\
licked it up. (L.) And قُمْحَةً مِنْهُ ↓ اِقْتَمَحْتُ [I<br>\
so ate a mouthful thereof, i. e. of what is eaten in<br>\
the manner described above]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
↓ اقتمحهُ likewise signifies, (L, K,) as also قَمِحَهُ,<br>\
(L,) He drank it, namely, what is called نَبِيذ,<br>\
(L, K,) and شَرَاب [app. as meaning wine], and<br>\
water, and milk. (L.)<br>\
-A2-  And, from قَمِحَهُ<br>\
signifying as expl. above, you say, قَمَحَ عَنِ المَآءِ,<br>\
(A,) or [simply] قَمَحَ, (S, L, K,) with fet-h, (S,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
قَمَحَ, (L,) inf. n. قُمُوحٌ; (S, L, K;) as also قَمَهَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
قَمَحَ, inf. n. قُمُوهٌ; (L;) and ↓ قامح, (A, L,)<br>\
inf. n. مُقَامَحَةٌ and قِمَاحٌ; (A;) and ↓ تقمّح, and<br>\
↓ انقمح; (S, L, K;) He (a camel) raised his<br>\
head (S, A, K) from the water (A) or at the<br>\
watering-trough, and refused to drink, (S, K,) his<br>\
thirst being satisfied, (S, A,) or by reason of<br>\
loathing, or of the coldness of the water, or of some<br>\
disease. (A.) And الإِبِلُ ↓ قَامَحَتِ The camels<br>\
came to the water and did not drink, (S, K,) but<br>\
raised their heads, (S,) by reason of disease, or of<br>\
cold, (S, K,) or of the coldness of the water, or<br>\
because their thirst was satisfied. (TA.) And<br>\
↓ شَرِبَ فَتَقَمَّحَ and ↓ انْقَمَحَ [He drank] and raised<br>\
his head and left drinking by reason of his thirst&#39;s<br>\
being satisfied. (S.) And فُلَانٌ مِنَ المَآءِ ↓ تقمّح<br>\
Such a one drank water, or the water, with<br>\
dislike, or loathing. (AZ.) ↓ أَشْرَبُ فَأَتَقَمَّحُ, said<br>\
by Umm-Zara, means (tropical:)  [I drink] and I satisfy<br>\
my thirst until I am not able to drink more, so I<br>\
raise my head like the [camel that is said to be]<br>\
مُقَامِح: (A, TA: *) Az says that التَّقَمُّحُ primarily<br>\
relates to water, but is metaphorically used by<br>\
her in relation to milk: she means that she<br>\
satisfied her thirst with milk until she raised her<br>\
head from drinking it like as does the camel when<br>\
he dislikes drinking water: (TA:) or, as some<br>\
relate her words, she said, فَأَتَقَنَّحُ, (A, TA, *)<br>\
which [likewise] means, “and I raise my head<br>\
in consequence of the being satisfied with drinking. ” (A.) [See also art. قنح.] ―<br>\
-b2-  قَمَحَ, aor.<br>\
قَمَحَ,<br>\
inf. n. قُمُوحٌ, is also expl. by Lth as signifying<br>\
He (a camel) became very languid by reason of<br>\
vehement thirst: but accord. to Az, this is wrong.<br>\
(L.)<br>\
2<br>\
قمّحهُ, (A, K,) inf. n. تَقْمِيحٌ, (K,) (tropical:)  He<br>\
repelled him (i. e. his companion, A) with a small<br>\
and paltry thing, in lieu of much that was due to<br>\
him; (A, K; *) like as the wronging commander<br>\
does to him who engages with him in a warring,<br>\
or warring and plundering, expedition, by doling<br>\
to him the least, or meanest, thing, and choosing<br>\
for himself in preference to him in the partition<br>\
of the spoil. (A, TA.)<br>\

Hence, (S, A,) شَهْرَا قِمَاحٍ, (S, A, K,) also called<br>\
↓ شَهْرَا قُمَاحٍ, (K,) The two coldest, (S, K,) or two<br>\
of the coldest, (A,) months (S, A, K) of winter;<br>\
(A;) said by Sh to be شِيبَانُ and مِلْحَانُ; (TA;<br>\
[in which it is also here said that they are the<br>\
two months whereof each is called كَانُون: if so,<br>\
corresponding to December and January O. S.:<br>\
but see شِيبَانُ, in art. شيب:]) so called because<br>\
the camels, when they come therein to water,<br>\
find its coldness hurtful to them, and therefore<br>\
raise their heads from it. (S.)<br>\

أُقْمِحَ, (MA,) [in my MS. copy of the<br>\
K indefinitely written اقمح, and in the CK<br>\
آقْمَحَ, but it is correctly أُقْمِحَ, as is shown by its<br>\
being added, after the explanation, in the TA,<br>\
“ whence ↓ مُقْمَحُونَ in the Kur ” (xxxvi. 7,] and<br>\
by explanations of this epithet in several of the<br>\
expositions of the Kur-án, and the like is also<br>\
indicated in the S,] inf. n. إِقْمَاحٌ, (S,) said of a<br>\
camel, (MA,) or of a man, and [in this case, but<br>\
not when said of a camel,] tropical, (TA,) He<br>\
raised his head, and contracted his eyes: (S,<br>\
MA, K, TA:) [or he was made to raise his head<br>\
and to contract his eyes:] it is expl. by Z as in<br>\
the K. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] one says, (S,) أَقْمَحَهُ<br>\
الغُلُّ (tropical:)  The غُلّ [i. e. the ring, or collar, of iron,<br>\
for the neck, or the shackle for the neck and<br>\
hands, consisting of two rings, one for the neck<br>\
and the other for the hands, connected by a bar<br>\
of iron,] caused his (i. e. a captive&#39;s K) head to<br>\
be raised, by reason of the straitness thereof; (S,<br>\
K, TA;) meaning that the bar of the غُلّ, which<br>\
[by its projecting above the ring around the<br>\
neck] pricked his chin, did not let him lower his<br>\
head; as is said in the A. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  الإِقْمَاحُ [as<br>\
inf. n. of أُقْمِحَ, like أُكْمِحَ (with ك and ح) in<br>\
form and in meaning,] also signifies (assumed tropical:)  The elevating of the head by reason of pride: and so<br>\
الإِكْمَاخُ. (L and TA in art. كمخ: but in the<br>\
CK, in that art, الاِقْماخُ, with خ.) And اقمح<br>\
بِأَنْفِهِ [i. e. أُقْمِحَ] signifies شَمَخَ [i. e. شَمَخَ بِأَنْفِهِ,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  He magnified, or exalted, himself; was proud;<br>\
behaved proudly, or disdainfully; or elevated his<br>\
nose, from pride]; (K, TA;) and raised his<br>\
head, scarcely ever, or never, lowering it: as<br>\
though the verb had two contr. significations.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  اقمح said of thirst is expl. by Lth as<br>\
signifying It rendered a camel very languid: but<br>\
accord. to Az, this is wrong. (L.)<br>\
-A2-  اقمح<br>\
السُّنْبُلُ The ears [of wheat] became pervaded by<br>\
the farinaceous substance. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And اقمح<br>\
البُرُّ, so in the T and L and other lexicons, but in<br>\
all the copies of the K البُرُّ ↓ اِقْتَمَحَ, The wheat<br>\
becomes mature قَمْح. (TA.)<br>\

قَمْحٌ Wheat, syn. بُرٌّ, (S, A, Mgh, L, Msb,<br>\
K,) and حِنْطَةٌ, and طَعَامٌ, (Msb,) when the<br>\
farinaceous substance pervades the ears, or from<br>\
the time when it has attained its full growth to<br>\
the time when it has become compact: (L:) [and<br>\
the grain of wheat; as also بُرٌّ and حِنْطَةٌ and<br>\
طَعَامٌ:] a word of the dial. of Syria. and sometimes used by the people of El-Hijáz; or, as<br>\
some say, a Coptic word; but the former assertion is the more correct: (TA:) the word بُرٌّ<br>\
is more chaste: (S in art. بر:) ↓ قَمْحَةٌ signifies<br>\
a single grain thereof. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  جَرَى القَمْحُ<br>\
فِى السُّنْبُلِ means The farinaceous substance pervaded the ears [of wheat]. (L.)<br>\
قَمْحَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
قُمْحَةٌ A mouthful of قَمِيحَة [q. v.]: (S, K:)<br>\
or, as more than one have said of water. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also القُمَّحَانُ.<br>\
القِمْحَى and القِمْحَاةُ The قَيْشَة [q. v.. generally<br>\
meaning the glans of the penis]. (K.)<br>\
القِمْحَانَةُ The part between the قَمَحْدُوَة [or<br>\
occiput] and what is termed نُقْرَةُ القَفَا [which is<br>\
the small hollow in the back of the neck]. (K.)<br>\
القُمَّحَانُ, thus accord. to the Basrees, (TA,)<br>\
and القُمَّحَانُ, and ↓ القُمْحَةُ, (K,) The [plant<br>\
called] وَرْس [q. v.]: (S, K, TA:) or [the kind<br>\
of perfume called] الذَّرِيرَةُ: (TA:) or (so accord.<br>\
to the K and TA, but in the S “ also,”) a substance that comes upon the surface of wine, like<br>\
الذَّرِيرَة: (S, K, TA:) it is the froth, or scum,<br>\
thereof: (L, TA:) or, as some say, (TA, but in<br>\
the K “ and,”) saffron: (K, TA:) or a certain<br>\
perfume: or a white substance that overspreads<br>\
wine resembling الذَّرِيرَة: this last is said to be what<br>\
is meant in the following verse by En-Nábighah<br>\
[Edh-Dhubyánee], the only poet known by AHn<br>\
to have mentioned القمّحان:<br>\
إِذَا فُضَّتْ خَوَاتِمُهُ عَلَاهُ<br>\
يَبِيسُ القُمَّحَانِ مِنَ المُدَامِ<br>\
[When its seals are broken, what is exsiccated of<br>\
the white substance resembling particles of calamus<br>\
aromaticus of the wine comes, or appears, upon<br>\
its surface]. (L, TA.)<br>\
قُمَاحٌ, a subst. from قَمَحَ or قَامَحَ, Aversion of<br>\
a camel from drinking, by reason of the thirst&#39;s<br>\
being satisfied, or of loathing, or of the coldness<br>\
of the water, or of some disease. (L. [See also<br>\
حُمَامٌ.]) Hence شَهْرَا قُمَاحٍ, also called شَهْرَا<br>\
قِمَاحٍ: see 3.<br>\
إِنَّهُ لَقَمُوحٌ لِلنَّبِيذِ Verily he is a great drinker<br>\
of the beverage called nebeedh. (ISh.)<br>\
قَمِيحَةٌ a subst. signifying What is eaten in the<br>\
manner termed اِقْتِمَاح, [see قَمِحَ,] (S, L,) of the<br>\
meal of parched barley or wheat, &amp;c., (L,) or such<br>\
as a digestive stomachic (جُوَارِش [often written<br>\
جَوَارِش], &amp;c.: (S:) expl. in the K by the word<br>\
جُوَارِش [only], in some copies with the addition<br>\
of a final ن [evidently a mistake for ت, since its<br>\
original in the Pers. گُوَارِشْ or گُوَارِشْت]: (TA:)<br>\
app. from القَمْحُ meaning البُرُّ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence]<br>\
one says, مَا أَصَابَتِ الإِبِلُ إِلَّا قَمِيحَةً مِنْ كَلَأٍ (tropical:)  The<br>\
camels obtained not [aught] save somewhat of dry<br>\
herbage which they took into the mouth unmoistened, or licked up. (A, TA.)<br>\
قَامِحٌ A camel raising his head (S, A, K) from<br>\
the water (A) or at the watering-trough, and<br>\
refusing to drink, (S, K,) his thirst being satisfied,<br>\
(S, A,) or by reason of loathing, or of the coldness<br>\
of the water, or of some disease: (A:) and disliking water from any cause: (K:) and ↓ مُقَامِحٌ<br>\
signifies the same, applied to a he-camel, (As, S,<br>\
A,) and to a she-camel: (As, S, K:) pl. of the<br>\
former قُمَّحٌ; (S, K;) and of ↓ the latter قِمَاحٌ,<br>\
which is anomalous, (S,) or this is pl. of قَامِحٌ,<br>\
or it is [an inf. n.] syn. with مُقَامَحَةٌ, used as an<br>\
epithet; you say إِبِلٌ قِمَاحٌ; (A;) and إِبِلٌ<br>\
↓ مُقَامِحَةٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K,) as expl. by Lth,<br>\
and so ↓ مُقَامِحٌ, but, accord. to Az, wrongly, (L,)<br>\
A camel very languid by reason of vehement<br>\
thirst. (L, K.)<br>\
