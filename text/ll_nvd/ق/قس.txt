after, or pursued, it: and he did so repeatedly, or<br>\
by degrees, and leisurely, or repeatedly and by<br>\

↓ تقسّسهُ. (A, * K.) [See also قَصَّهُ, which, accord.<br>\
to the TA, is a dial. form of قَسَّهُ.] You say,<br>\
الأَخْبَارَ ↓ تقسّس [He sought after, or sought after<br>\
repeatedly, &amp;c., news, or tidings]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,<br>\
app.,] قَسٌّ signifies Calumniation; or malicious<br>\

publishing, of discourse, and speaking evil of men<br>\
behind their backs, or in their absence: (TA:)<br>\
[probably inf. ns., of which the verb is قَسَّ;<br>\
perhaps a trans. verb; for] قَسَّهُمْ signifies He<br>\
hurt them, or annoyed them, by foul speech;<br>\
(K;) as though he sought, or sought repeatedly,<br>\
or by degrees and leisurely, or repeatedly and by<br>\
degrees and leisurely, after that which would<br>\
hurt them, or annoy them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence<br>\
also,] قَسَّ مَا عَلَى العَظْمِ, (A, K,) مِنَ اللَّحْمِ,<br>\
(A,) aor.<br>\
قَسُ3َ, inf. n. قَسٌّ; (TA;) and ↓ قَسْقَسَهُ;<br>\

قَسُ3َ,] (TK,) inf. n. ↓ قُسُوسَةٌ and ↓ قِسِيسَةٌ, accord.<br>\
to all the copies of the K, [so says SM, in the TA,<br>\

copy of the K I find the latter written ↓ قَسِيسَة,]<br>\
but correctly ↓ قِسِّيسَّةٌ, as written by Lth, (TA,)<br>\
He became a قَسّ [or قِسِّيس]: (K, * TK:) or<br>\
↓ قَسُوسَةٌ and ↓ قِسِيسَّةٌ [so in a copy of the M, but in<br>\
a copy of the A ↓ قُسُوسِيَّةٌ and ↓ قِسِّيسِيَّةٌ, which I<br>\
hold to be the correct forms of these two words,<br>\
the former from the pl. of قَسٌّ and the latter from<br>\
قِسِّيسٌ,] are simple substs., (M,) and you say,<br>\
[using them as such,] لَهُ القُسُوسِيَّةُ and القِسِّيسَّةُ<br>\
To him belongs the rank, or office, of قَسّ or<br>\
قِسِّيس. (A.)<br>\
