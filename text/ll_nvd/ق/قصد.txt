He means وَيَنْبَغِى أَنْ يَقْصِدَ; but as he makes an<br>\
ellipsis, and puts يقصد in the place, syntactically, of ينبغى, he makes it marfooa, because it<br>\
has the place of that which is [virtually] marfooa:<br>\
and Fr says, he makes it marfooa because of the<br>\
disagreement; for as its meaning disagrees with<br>\
that of the preceding verb, it is made to disagree<br>\
therefore in desinential syntax. (S, L.)<br>\

heard them sing what is of the metre called<br>\
الخفيف: (M, L:) such poetry is thus termed<br>\
because composed with purpose and consideration,<br>\
and earnest endeavour to make it excellent; from<br>\
قَصْدٌ as syn. with أَمٌّ: or because composed with<br>\
care, and trimmed with excellent expressions and<br>\
choice meanings, from قَصِيدٌ signifying “ thick<br>\

to chaste, or eloquent, or excellent, language the<br>\
epithet سَمِين, or “ fat: ” (L:) or because of its<br>\
