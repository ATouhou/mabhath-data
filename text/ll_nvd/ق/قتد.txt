التَّقْتِيدُ [or تَقْتِيدُ القَتَادِ] signifies The cutting<br>\
of the trees called قَتَاد [q. v.], and burning them,<br>\
(L, K,) i. e. burning [off] their thorns, (L,) and<br>\
then giving them as fodder to the camels, (L, K,)<br>\
which fatten upon them on the occasion of<br>\
drought: (L:) one says, قتّد القَتَادَ, inf. n. as<br>\
above, He (a man) scorched, or slightly burned,<br>\
the extremities of the قتاد with fire: (O:) the<br>\
man comes, in the year of drought, and kindles<br>\
fire among them, so that he burns their thorns,<br>\
then he feeds his camels therewith: (T, O, TA:)<br>\
one says of him who does this, قتّد إِبِلَهُ [i. e. He<br>\
fed his camels with قتاد thus prepared]: so says<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Abbád: (O:) and the act [of burning &amp;c.]<br>\
is called التَّقْتِيدُ. (T, TA.)<br>\
قَتَدٌ (S, O, L) and ↓ قَتِدٌ (Kr, L) The wood of<br>\
a [camel&#39;s saddle that is called] رَحْل: (S, O, L:)<br>\
or one of the things that compose the apparatus of a<br>\
رَحْل: or the whole apparatus thereof: (L:) pl.<br>\
[of mult.] قُتُودٌ and [of pauc.] أَقْتَادٌ (S, O, L) and<br>\
أَقْتُدٌ: (L:) but accord. to the Basrees, قُتُودٌ,<br>\
signifying the pieces of wood of a رَحْل, has no<br>\
singular. (Ham p. 662.)<br>\
قَتِدٌ [part. n. of قَتِدَ said of a camel: see 1].<br>\
One says إِبِلٌ قَتِدَةٌ, and قَتَادَى, [the latter being<br>\
pl. of the former,) Camels having a complaint<br>\
(Ks, S, O, K) of their bellies (Ks, S, O) in consequence of eating of the trees called قَتَاد: (Ks, S,<br>\
O, K:) like as one says رَمِثَةٌ and رَمَاثَى. (Ks, S,<br>\
O.)<br>\

قَتَادٌ [a coll. gen. n., The tragacanth-tree;] a<br>\
species of thorny tree; this is the larger sort;<br>\
(S;) a species of thorny and hard tree, which<br>\
bears a pod, and of which the fruit is like that of<br>\

species of hard tree having thorns like needles;<br>\
(K;) a species of tree having thorns like needles,<br>\
and a small dust-coloured leaf, and a fruit growing therewith of the same colour, resembling the<br>\
date-stone; (AHn, O, * L;) the large قتاد [thus<br>\
described] produces large wood, and its thorns are<br>\
curved and short, and it is of the [class termed]<br>\
عِضَاه; (Aboo-Ziyád, L;) or it is not reckoned<br>\
among the عِضَاه: (AHn, L: [but this assertion<br>\
may perhaps be meant to apply to the smaller<br>\
sort: respecting the larger, see also 1 and 2:])<br>\
the smaller sort is a species of tree of which the<br>\
fruit is a bladder (نُفَّاخَة) like that of the عُشَر<br>\
[q. v.]; (S, O, L;) accord. to the ancient Arabs<br>\
of the desert, it is not tall, being of the size of a<br>\
man sitting; (L;) and this sort grows upwards,<br>\
no part of it spreading, consisting of twigs, or<br>\
shoots, in a collected state, every one of which is<br>\
full of thorns from its top to its bottom. (Aboo-Ziyád, L.) It is said in a prov., مِنْ دُونِهِ خَرْطُ<br>\
القَتَادِ [expl. in art. خرط, first paragraph].<br>\
(S, L.)<br>\
إِبِل قَتَادِيَّةٌ Camels that eat the trees called قَتَاد.<br>\

(S, O,) is the name of a certain عَقَبَة [or mountain-road], (S, O, K,) or a ثَنِيَّة [which is said by<br>\
some to be syn. with عَقَبَة]; (K;) [and if so, it<br>\
is properly imperfectly decl.;] or any ثَنِيَّة is<br>\
called قُتَائِدَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
