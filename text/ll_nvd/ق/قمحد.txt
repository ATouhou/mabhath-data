قحد; and Msb;) that is to say, (Msb,) the<br>\
[occiput or] hinder part of the back of the head;<br>\
(T, Msb, K;) i. e., the surface between the ذُؤَابَة<br>\
[here app. meaning the hair that surrounds the<br>\
round part of the head] and what is termed فَأْسُ<br>\
القَفَا [or the small protuberance above the back of<br>\
the neck]: (T:) also, the protuberance above the<br>\
back of the neck, (L, K,) between the ذُؤَابَة [see<br>\
above] and the back of the neck, sloping down<br>\
from the هَامَة [or middle, or crown, or top, of<br>\
the head]; it is the part of the head which<br>\
touches the ground when a man lies on his back:<br>\
(L:) also, the upper part of the back of the head:<br>\
(L, K:) or that part of the bone of the head<br>\
which projects over the back of the neck; the هامة<br>\
being above it; and the قَذَال, below it, next the<br>\
part of the back of the neck that is between the<br>\
ears: (AZ, L:) pl. قَمَاحِدُ (S, L, K, &amp;c.) and<br>\
قَمَاحِيدُ and قَمَحْدُوَاتٌ. (L.) Accord. to J and<br>\
AHei, the م is an augmentative letter; but<br>\
others hold it to be a radical; and F says, that<br>\
J&#39;s mentioning this word in art. قحد requires<br>\
consideration. (TA.)<br>\
