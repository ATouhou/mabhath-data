قَحَّ, (L, K, TA,) [sec. pers., app., قَحُحْتَ,]<br>\
aor. يَقُحُّ, (L,) inf. n. قَحَاحَةٌ and قُحُوحَةٌ, He, or<br>\
it, was, or became, such as is termed قُحّ [i. e.<br>\
pure, sheer, mere, unmixed, unmingled, unadulterated, or genuine; said of, or in relation to,<br>\
meanness, sordidness, or ignobleness, and generosity, liberality, or nobleness, and anything].<br>\
(S, L, K.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
قَحْقَحَةٌ [an inf. n. of which the verb<br>\
is قَحْقَحَ] signifies The laughing of the ape or<br>\
monkey. (L, K.) [Compare with this قَهْقَهَةٌ.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And The voice&#39;s being, or becoming, reiterated<br>\
in the throat, or fauces. (L, K.) And it is<br>\
similar to بُحَّةٌ [which means A hoarseness, roughness, harshness, or gruffness, of the voice]. (L.)<br>\
[But both of these significations are also assigned<br>\
in the L to فَحْفَحَةٌ, with ف; to which alone, of<br>\
these two words, they may perhaps belong.]<br>\
قُحٌّ Pure, sheer, mere, unmixed, unmingled, unadulterated, or genuine; (As, S, A, K;) in, or in<br>\
respect of, (As, S, A,) or applied to, (K,) meanness, sordidness, or ignobleness, and generosity,<br>\
liberality, or nobleness, (As, S, A, K,) and anything: (K:) fem. قُحَّةٌ: and pl. أَقْحَاحٌ. (S, A.)<br>\
One says لَئِيمٌ قُحٌّ [One that is mean, sordid, or<br>\
ignoble,] in whom is nought of generosity, liberality,<br>\
or nobleness. (A.) And عَبْدٌ قُحٌّ A pure, or<br>\
mere, slave; one that is of purely servile condition;<br>\
(S;) or such as is termed قِنٌّ [which means the<br>\
same; or one born of slave-parents; &amp;c.]. (A.)<br>\
And عَرَبِىٌّ قُحٌّ A pure, or genuine, Arabian; one<br>\
of pure Arabian race; fem. عَرَبِيَّةٌ قُحَّةٌ: (S, A,<br>\
TA:) as also كُحٌّ and كُحَّةٌ; in which the ك is<br>\
a substitute for the ق; for they said أَقْحَاحٌ, but<br>\
not أَكْحَاحٌ: [i. e. كُحُّ is not a dial. var. of قُحٌّ,<br>\
because the former has no pl.:] or أَكْحَاحٌ is<br>\
used as a pl. of كُحٌّ. (L in art. كح.) And<br>\
أَعْرَابِىٌّ قُحٌّ and ↓ قُحَاحٌ (K, TA) A pure, or<br>\
genuine, Arab of the desert: or one who has not<br>\
entered the towns, nor mixed with their inhabitants:<br>\
(TA:) pl. أَعْرَابٌ أَفْحَاحٌ. (S, TA.) And فُلَانٌ<br>\
مِنْ قُحِّ العَرَبِ (ISk, A, * TA) and كُحِّهِمْ, (ISk,<br>\
TA) Such a one is of the pure, or genuine, of the<br>\
Arabs. (ISk, A, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also Coarse, rough,<br>\
or rude, in make, or in nature or disposition; applied to a man; (Lth, S, K;) as though he were<br>\
purely so; (S;) and to other than man. (Lth,<br>\
K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And (hence, TA) Unripe, applied in this<br>\
sense to a melon, or water-melon, (Lth, A, K,<br>\
TA,) because of its dryness: (A:) or one in its<br>\
last state: but Az says that Lth has erred in explaining the word in the former of these senses,<br>\
and that the correct word is فِجٌّ. (TA.)<br>\
قُحَاحُ أَمْرٍ The root, foundation, origin, or<br>\
source, of a thing or an affair; its essence, or very<br>\
essence; or what is, or constitutes, its most essential, or elementary, part; the ultimate element to<br>\
which it can be reduced or resolved; its utmost<br>\
point or particular; or its principal, or best, part;<br>\
syn. أَصْلُهُ (Kr, L, K, TA) and فَصُّهُ (K, TA) and<br>\
خَالِصُهُ. (L, K, TA.) One says, صَارَ إِلَى قُحَاحِ<br>\
الأَمْرِ He reached, or arrived at, the root, &amp;c., of<br>\
the affair. (L.) And لَقَد وَقَعْتُ بِقُحَاحِ قُرِّكَ, as<br>\
also وَقَعْتُ بِقُرِّكَ, I have become acquainted with<br>\
(عَلِمْتُ) all that thou knowest, nothing thereof<br>\
being hidden from me. (Ibn-Buzurj, TA.) And<br>\
لَأَضْطَرَّنَّكَ إِلى قُحَاحِكَ I will assuredly make thee<br>\
to have recourse to thine utmost effort, or endeavour,<br>\
i. e. إِلَى جَهْدِكَ: or, as IAar says, لا ضطرّنّك الى<br>\
تُرِّكَ وَقُحَاحِكَ, i. e. إِلَى أَصْلِكَ. (L. [See أَصْلٌ.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  See also قُحٌّ, latter half.<br>\
قَحِيحٌ. [It is said in the K, القَحِيحُ فَوْقَ العَبِّ<br>\
وَالجَرْعِ: but it appears from a statement in the<br>\
TK that these words are a mistake copied from<br>\
the Moheet of Ibn-&#39;Abbad, founded upon a mistranscription of القُحْقُحُ فَوْقَ القِبِّ. See what<br>\
next follows.]<br>\
قُحْقُحٌ [The ischium; i. e.] the bone that surrounds the posterior pudendum, (S, K,) somewhat<br>\
above the قِبّ [or end of the rump-bone]: (S:) or<br>\
the part where the two hip-bones meet, internally:<br>\
or [rather] what intervenes between the two hipbones, and surrounds the خَوْرَان [or anus, or part<br>\
in which is the anus]; the خوران being between<br>\
the قُحْقُح and the عُصْعُص: or the lower part of<br>\
the عَجْب [or rump-bone, or root of the tail], in<br>\
the integuments (طِبَاق) of the two hip-bones; somewhat above the قِبّ: or the bone upon which is<br>\
the place wherein the penis is inserted, next, or<br>\
near, to the lower part of the رَكَب [or pubes]: it<br>\
is said in the T that it is no part of the extremity<br>\
of the backbone, and that its place of junction, or<br>\
meeting, is outside the عُصْعُص: also, that the<br>\
upper part of the عُصْعُص is the عَجْب, and its<br>\
lower part is the ذَنَب: or the عصعص is the internal extremity of the backbone, and the عجب<br>\
is its external extremity, and the خَوْرَان is the دُبُر:<br>\
(L, TA:) or, accord. to IAar, i. q. عُصْعُصٌ. (O<br>\
voce عُكْدَةٌ.)<br>\
قَرَبٌ قَحْقَاحٌ and ↓ مُقَحْقِحٌ [A night&#39;s journey<br>\
to water] that is hard, or difficult. (K.)<br>\
مُقَحْقِحٌ: see what next precedes.<br>\
