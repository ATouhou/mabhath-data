came, and broke off his talk, and turned it to<br>\
what was wholly different in subject, or to what<br>\
had but little connection with the subject of the<br>\

O, K,) aor. قَضَبَ. (K.) And (TA) (assumed tropical:)  He took from<br>\
the camels, and trained, one in an untrained<br>\
state; (M, K;) as also ↓ اقتضبهُ. (TA.) And<br>\

فِصْفِصَةٌ]; (M;) called قَضْبٌ because it is cut.<br>\
(Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Any tree of which the branches<br>\
grow long and lank: (K, * TA:) بَسَطَتْ in the K<br>\
is a mistranscription for سَبِطَتْ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
Certain trees from which bows are made; (En-Nadr, O, K;) said to be of the kind called نَبْعٌ.<br>\
(O.) AHn says that قضب [accord. to the L and<br>\
TA app. قَضْبٌ, but accord. to a copy of the M<br>\
↓ قَضَبٌ, which I think a mistranscription,] is the<br>\
name of Certain trees of the plains, or soft tracts,<br>\
growing among collections of [other] trees; having<br>\
leaves like those of the pear-tree, except that they<br>\
are thinner, and more soft; and as trees [in<br>\
general] resembling pear-trees: the camels feed<br>\
upon its leaves and the extremities of its branches;<br>\
but when the camel has become satiated therewith, he<br>\
forsakes it for a time, for it sets his teeth on edge,<br>\
and irritates his chest, and occasions him cough.<br>\

from a tree of the species called نَبْع, whereof (مِنْهُ<br>\
[for which the CK has فيهِ]) an arrow [in the<br>\
complete state] is made: pl. قَضَبَاتُ. (M, K.<br>\
[In the TA, the pl. is said to be قَضْبَاتٌ, with<br>\
fet-h and sukoon; but this, as pl. of a subst. of<br>\
the class of قَبْضَةٌ, is anomalous.])<br>\

flock, or herd, of sheep or goats. (O, K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
And Such as is slender, and light, or active; as<br>\

tree], (S, M, O, Msb, K,) [and particularly] that is<br>\
cut off: (M, Msb:) pl. قُضْبَانٌ (S, M, O, Msb, K)<br>\
and قِضْبَانٌ (M, O, Msb, K, but this is less approved, TA) and قُضُبٌ, and ↓ قَضْبٌ is a quasi-pl. n.<br>\
(M, TA.) [Hence] one says, مَلَكَ البُرْدَةَ وَالقَضِيبَ<br>\

rod], meaning اُسْتُخْلِفَ [i. e. he became a successor]. (A.) ―<br>\
