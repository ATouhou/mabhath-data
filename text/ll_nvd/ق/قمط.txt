a rope with which the arms and legs, or hands and<br>\
feet, of a captive are bound together: (Msb, K:)<br>\
pl. as above; (Mgh;) and the pl. of قُمُطٌ [probably a mistranscription for قِمْطٌ] is أَقْمَاطٌ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  قُمُطٌ also signifies The شُرُط, (Mgh, Msb,)<br>\
meaning wide woven ropes, (Mgh,) of fibres or<br>\
leaves of the palm-tree, by which a booth of reeds<br>\
or canes is bound: or, as some say, the pieces of<br>\

bundles of reeds or canes that form the roof:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) or the heads [or extremities] thereof:<br>\
(Msb:) or قمط, with damm, [app. meaning قُمُطٌ,<br>\
with damm to the second letter as well as the<br>\
first, or قُمْطٌ as a contraction of قُمُطٌ, like as<br>\
كُتْبٌ, accord. to some, is a contraction of كُتُبٌ,]<br>\
as IAth says, on the authority of Hr, (TA,) or<br>\
↓ قِمْطٌ, with kesr, (S, K,) signifies the thing, (S,)<br>\
or rope, (K, TA,) of fibres or leaves of the palmtree, (TA,) with which booths of reeds or canes<br>\

stratagems or tricks. (TA.) [Hence,] وَقَعْتُ<br>\
عَلَى قِمَاطِهِ (assumed tropical:)  I became acquainted with his stratagems, or tricks, (Lth, K,) or his snares by which<br>\
he snares men. (TA.) [The explanation of this<br>\
phrase by Lth is وقعت عَلى بُنُودِهِ: that in the K,<br>\
فَطِنْتُ بُنُودَهُ: another explanation is given in the<br>\
TA, which is, فَطِنْتُ لَهُ فى تُؤَدَةٍ: in the JK,<br>\
فَطَنْتُ بِتُؤَودَةٍ: the right reading in the K and JK<br>\
seems to be فَطِنْتُ بِبُنُودِهِ: and that of the explanation in the TA mentioned in this sentence is<br>\
most probably, I think, فَطِنْتُ لَهُ فِى بُنُودِهِ I<br>\
