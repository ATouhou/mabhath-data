the figure of Leo commonly known; but the<br>\
ancient Arabs, or many of them, extended the<br>\
figure of that constellation (as they did also that<br>\
of Scorpio) far beyond the limits which we assign<br>\
to it: (see الذِّرَاعُ:) another meaning of قُنْب in<br>\

it unlikely:] the Arabs also called the same star<br>\
