قَعَثْتُ لَهُ قَعْثَةً, (S, O, K, * TA, *) [accord. to<br>\
which last, ↓ قَعْثَةٌ is an inf. n., as also قَعْثٌ, but,<br>\
if an inf. n., it is app. an inf. n. un.,] aor.<br>\
قَعُثَ,<br>\
(accord. to the TK, [but I think it is more probably<br>\
قَعَثَ, agreeably with a general rule, like the<br>\
aor. of the same verb in the next sentence,])<br>\
means حَفَنْتُ لَهُ حَفُنَةٌ, (S, O,) i. e. I gave to him<br>\
a small quantity, (S, O, K, *) مِنَ الشَّىْءِ [of the<br>\
thing]. (TA.)<br>\

قَعَثَ, inf. n. قَعْثٌ,<br>\

-b2-<br>\
And اقعث لَهُ العَطِيَّةَ He made the gift to him<br>\
large; (S, O, K, TA;) and so ↓ اِقْتَعَثَهَا, and اقعثهُ<br>\
[i. e. اقعثهُ العَطِيَّةَ]. (TA. See the verse cited<br>\
voce مُقْعَثٌ; and the remark of As respecting it.)<br>\
7<br>\
انقعث It was, or became, pulled out, or up,<br>\
(As, S, O, TA,) from the foundation, or utterly;<br>\
(As, S, TA;) it was, or became, eradicated, or<br>\
uprooted. (K.) One says, ضَرَبَهُ فَانْقَعَثَ He<br>\
struck it, and it became pulled out, or up, (As, S,<br>\
O, TA,) from the foundation, or utterly. (As,<br>\
S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And It (a wall) fell down from its<br>\
foundation: like انقعف. (As, S, O.)<br>\
8<br>\
اقتعث He (a digger) took forth much earth<br>\
from a well. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 4.<br>\
قَعَثٌ Muchness, or abundance. (TA. [See<br>\
قَعِيثٌ.])<br>\
قَعْثَةٌ: see the first sentence of this art.<br>\
قُعَاثٌ A certain disorder in the noses of sheep,<br>\
or goats: (O, K:) thus expl. by Aboo-Turáb.<br>\
(O.)<br>\
قَعِيثٌ, (O, K,) as expl. by As, (O,) Paltry,<br>\
or little in quantity; syn. هَيِّنٌ and يَسِيرٌ. (O, K.<br>\
[See also مُقْعَثٌ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Abundant, or copious;<br>\
applied to rain: (S, O, K:) and to a benefit, or<br>\
benefaction, &amp;c.: (TA:) and to a gift (سَيْب):<br>\
(O, TA:) and, (S, K, TA,) or as some say,<br>\
(O,) to a torrent (سَيْل), (S, O, K,) as meaning<br>\
thus, (S, O,) or as meaning great: (K:) whence,<br>\
in a verse of Ru-beh,<br>\
↓ مَا شَآءَ مِنْ أَبْوَابِ كَسْبٍ مِقْعَثِ<br>\
[What he will of the means of the attainment of<br>\
abundant gain]; مِقْعَثٌ being of the measure<br>\
مِفْعَلٌ from قَعِيثٌ as applied to rain &amp;c. (O.<br>\
[The word كسب, of which the right reading is<br>\
certainly as above, is there imperfectly written,<br>\
more like كُسْب than كَسْب.])<br>\
مُقْعَثٌ [pass. part. n. of 4]. Ru-beh says,<br>\
أَقْعَثَنِى مِنْهُ بِسَيْبٍ مُقْعَثِ<br>\
لَيْسَ بِمَنْزُورٍ وَلَا بِرَيِّثِ<br>\
[He gave me liberally thereof, or from him, a<br>\
large gift, (lit., accord. to the explanation of the<br>\
verb, a gift made large,) not such as was small,<br>\
or not such as was obtained by importunity, nor<br>\
such as was slow in coming]: (S, * TA:) but As<br>\
says that Ru-beh has done ill in using the phrase<br>\
بسيب مقعث; for مُقْعَث, he says, means paltry,<br>\
or little in quantity; syn. هَيِّنٌ and يَسِيرٌ [like<br>\
قَعِيثٌ, which is said to have this meaning and<br>\
also the contr. thereof]. (TA. [Perhaps the right<br>\
reading in the verse cited above is ↓ مِقْعَث.]<br>\
مِقْعَثٌ: see قَعِيثٌ. [See also what here immediately precedes.]<br>\
