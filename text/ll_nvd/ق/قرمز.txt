a certain Armenian dye, (Lth, K,) of a red<br>\

fluid of a kind of worm found in the woods of<br>\
Armenia: (Lth, K:) such is said to be the case:<br>\
and in some of the correct copies of the K we find<br>\
the following addition: it is said to be red like the<br>\
lentil, in the form of grains: it falls upon a species<br>\
of بَلَّوط, [or oak,] in the month of آذَار, [or March,<br>\
O. S.,] and if not gathered, it becomes a flying<br>\
thing, and flies: it is used as a dye for animal<br>\
substances, such as wool and skill, but not cotton.<br>\
