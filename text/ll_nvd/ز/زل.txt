زَلَلْتَ, [third pers. زَلَّ,] aor. تَزِلُّ; (S, K;)<br>\
and زَلِلْتَ, [third pers. likewise زَلَّ,] aor. تَزَلُّ;<br>\
(Fr, S, K;) inf. n. زَلِيلٌ, (Lh, S, K,) which is of<br>\
the former verb, (S,) and زَلٌّ, (Lh, K,) also of<br>\
the former verb, (Msb,) and زُلُولٌ and زِلِّيلَى [or,<br>\
accord. to the S, this is a simple subst.,] and<br>\
زِلِّيلَآءُ (Lh, K) and مَزِلَّةٌ, (K,) [all app. of the<br>\
former verb,] and زَلَلٌ, (Fr, S, K,) which is of the<br>\
latter verb; (Fr, S;) Thou slippedst (K) in mud,<br>\
or in speech, (S, K,) or in judgment, or opinion,<br>\
or in religion: (TA:) or you say, زَلَّ عَنْ مَكَانِهِ,<br>\
aor. يَزِلُّ, inf. n. زَلٌّ [&amp;c. as above]; and زَلَّ, aor.<br>\
يَزَلُّ, inf. n. زَلَلٌ; the former verb of the class of<br>\
ضَرَبَ; and the latter, of the class of تَعِبَ; meaning he, or it, moved away, or aside, [or slipped,]<br>\
from his, or its, place: and زَلَّ فِى مَنْطِقِهِ, or<br>\
فِعْلِهِ, aor. يَزِلُّ, like يَضْرِبُ, inf. n. زَلَّةٌ, he made a<br>\

(Msb.) فَإِنْ زَلَلْتُمْ, in the Kur ii. 205, means But<br>\

fully: (Jel:) this is the common reading: but<br>\
some read زَلِلْتُمْ. (TA.) And you say, زَلَّ زَلَّةً He<br>\
committed a slip in speech and the like. (TA.)<br>\
Accord. to IAth, زَلِيلٌ signifies The passing of a<br>\
body from one place to another: and ―<br>\
-b2-  hence it<br>\
is metaphorically used in like manner in relation<br>\
to a benefit: one says, زَلَّتْ مِنْهُ إِلَى فُلَانٍ نِعْمَةٌ,<br>\
inf. n. زَلِيلٌ, meaning (tropical:)  A benefit passed, or was<br>\
transferred, from him, (i. e. a benefactor,) to such<br>\
a one. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  زَلَّ, inf. n. زَلِيلٌ and زُلُولٌ, also<br>\
signifies He (a man) passed along quickly: (ISh,<br>\
K:) and زَلَّ, inf. n. زَلِيلٌ, he ran: and زَلِيلٌ, a<br>\
light, or an agile, walking or pacing: (TA:)<br>\
[and زَلَلٌ, mentioned above as an inf. n., seems to<br>\
have the same, or a similar, signification:] a<br>\
rájiz says, (S,) namely, Aboo-Mohammad El-<br>\
Hadhlemee, (TA,) or Aboo-Mohammad ElFak&#39;asee, (O,)<br>\
إِنَّ لَهَا فِى العَامِ ذِى الفُتُوقِ<br>\

رِعْيَةَ مَوْلًى نَاصِحٍ شَفِيقِ<br>\
(S in the present art., * and in art. صفق, * and art.<br>\
فتق, but in this last with رَبٍّ in the place of<br>\
مَوْلًى, and TA,) [i. e. Verily they have, in the<br>\
year of little rain, (thus الفتوق, as here used, is<br>\
expl. in the S in art. فتق,) and in the passing<br>\
along lightly to the place which is the object of<br>\
the journey, and in the being removed from a<br>\
tract which they have depastured to a place in<br>\
which is pasture, (thus التصفيق, as here used, is<br>\
expl. in the S in art. صفق,) the tending of a<br>\
master honest in his conduct, or desirous of their<br>\
good, benevolent, or compassionate]: he is speaking of his camels: (S in art. فتق:) he means<br>\
that they pass along lightly [so I render تَزِلُّ]<br>\
from place to place in search of herbage: and<br>\
النيّة means the place to which they purpose<br>\
journeying. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,] زَلَّ عُمُرُهُ (assumed tropical:)  His life<br>\
went, or passed, [or glided,] away. (K, TA.) ―<br>\

-b6-  زَلَّ, inf. n. زَلَلٌ, (K,) said of a man, (TA,)<br>\
[and app. of a wolf, (see أَزَلُّ,)] He was, or<br>\
became, light [of flesh] in the hips, or haunches:<br>\
(K:) or زَلَلٌ signifies a woman&#39;s having little<br>\
flesh in the posteriors and thighs. (S.)<br>\
-A2-  زَلَّ,<br>\
aor. يَزِلُّ, accord. to analogy, as an intrans. v.,<br>\
from أَزْلَلْتُ إِلَيْهِ meaning “ I gave to him ” of<br>\
food &amp;c., should signify He took, or received:<br>\
and hence the saying of the lawyers, وَيَزِلُّ إِنْ عَلِمَ<br>\
الرِّضَى And he shall take, or receive, or the food<br>\
[if he have knowledge of permission, or consent].<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\

ازلّهُ, (K,) inf. n. إِزْلَالٌ, (TA,) He, or it,<br>\
made him, or caused him, to slip in mud, (K,<br>\
TA,) or in speech, or in judgment, or opinion,<br>\
or in religion; (TA;) and ↓ استزلّهُ signifies the<br>\
same. (S, * MA, K, * PS. [But respecting this<br>\
latter, see what follows.]) It is said in the Kur<br>\
[ii. 34], فَأَزَلَّهُمَا الشَّيْطَانُ عَنْهَا [And the Devil made<br>\
them, or caused them, both, to slip, or fall, from<br>\
it, namely, Paradise (الجَنَّة)]; and one reading is<br>\
أَزَالَمُهَا, i. e. removed them: or, as some say, it<br>\
means caused them to commit a slip, or wrong<br>\
action, in consequence of it [referring to the tree]:<br>\
or, accord. to Th, caused them to slip in judgment. (TA.) And in the same, iii. 149, ↓ اسْتَزَلَّهُمُ<br>\
الشَّيْطَانُ The Devil made them, or caused them,<br>\
to slip: (Jel:) or, as some say, sought to make<br>\

One says also, أَزَلَّ فُلَانًا إِلَى القَوْمِ He sent forward such a one to the people, or party. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And أَزَلَّهُ عَنْ رَأْيِهِ He made him to turn from<br>\
his opinion. (MA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And as زَلِيلٌ signifies the<br>\
“ passing ” of a body from one place to another,<br>\
one says, speaking metaphorically, (IAth, TA,)<br>\
أَزَلَّ إِلَيْهِ نِعْمَةً (tropical:)  He did to him a benefit: (S,<br>\
IAth, K:) whence, (TA,) it is said in a trad.,<br>\
مَنْ أُزِلَّتْ إِلَيْهِ نِعْمَةٌ فَلْيَشْكُرْهَا (assumed tropical:)  He to whom a<br>\
benefit is done [let him be grateful for it].<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, S, * Mgh, Msb.) And أَزْلَلْتُ لَهُ زُلَّةً (assumed tropical:)  I<br>\
did to him a benefit: one should not say زللت<br>\
[thus written, app. for ↓ زَلَّلْتُ: but see مُزَلِّلٌ].<br>\
(TA.) And أَزْلَلْتُ إِلَيْهِ [alone] (assumed tropical:)  I gave to him:<br>\
or I did to him a benefit. (Msb.) And أَزْلَلْتُ<br>\
إِلَيْهِ مِنَ الطَّعَامِ وَغَيْرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  I gave to him of the food<br>\

R. Q. 1<br>\
زَلْزَلَهُ, (S, * Msb, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n. زَلْزَلَةٌ<br>\
and زِلْزَالٌ and زَلْزَالٌ and زُلْزَالٌ, (K,) or the first of<br>\
these is an inf. n. [by universal consent], (S,) and<br>\
so is the second, but the third is a simple subst.,<br>\
(Zj, S, Msb,) though this and the fourth [which<br>\
is the least known] have the authority of certain<br>\
readings of passages of the Kur, namely, xcix. 1<br>\
for both of these, and xxxiii. 11 for the latter of<br>\
them, (TA,) He put it, or him, into a state of<br>\
motion, commotion, or agitation: (Msb, K, TA:)<br>\
or into a state of convulsion, or violent motion.<br>\
(Zj, TA.) You say, زَلْزَلَ اللّٰهُ الأَرْضَ [i. e. God<br>\

or violent motion. (Zj, TA) And جَآءَ بِالإِبِلِ يُزَلْزِلُهَا<br>\
He came with, or brought, the camels, driving<br>\
them with roughness, violence, or vehemence.<br>\
(TA.) Some say that زَلْزَلَةٌ is from الزَّلَلُ فِى الرَّأْىِ<br>\
[i. e. “ the making a slip in judgment, or opinion ”]: so when one says, زُلْزِلَ القَوْمُ the meaning is, The people, or party, were turned away<br>\
from the right course, and fear was cast into<br>\
their hearts. (TA.) It is said in a trad., اَللّٰهُمَّ<br>\
اهْزِمِ الأَحْزَابَ وَزَلْزِلْهُمْ i. e. [O God, rout, defeat, or<br>\
put to flight, the combined forces, and] make their<br>\
state of affairs to be unsound, or unsettled. (TA.)<br>\
Accord. to IAmb, أَصَابَتِ القَوْمَ زَلْزَلَةٌ means An<br>\
affrighting befell the people, or party; from the<br>\
saying in the Kur [ii. 210], وَزُلْزِلُوا حَتَّى يَقُولَ<br>\
الرَّسُولُ i. e. And they were affrighted [so that the<br>\
Apostle said]: (L, TA:) or were vehemently<br>\
agitated. (Ksh, Bd.) ―<br>\
-b2-  مَا زَلْزَلْتُ قَطُّ مَآءً أَبْرَدَ مِنْ<br>\
مَآءِ الثغوبِ [or الثَّغَبِ, as it is written in the explanation of this saying, the latter being app. the<br>\
right reading], said by Aboo-Shembel, means I<br>\
have not put into my throat, or fauces, ever, water<br>\
slipping into it cooler than the water of the ثَغَب [or<br>\
pool left by a torrent in the shade of a mountain].<br>\
(Az, TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَزَلْزَلَ It was, or became, in a state of<br>\
motion, commotion, agitation, convulsion, or violent motion. (Msb, TA.) You say, تَزَلْزَلَتِ الأَرْضُ<br>\
(S, Msb, TA) The earth [quaked: or quaked violently:] was, or became, in a state of motion,<br>\
commotion, &amp;c.: (Msb:) the verb in this phrase<br>\
[and in others] is quasi-pass. of R. Q. 1. (S, TA.)<br>\
And تَزَلْزَلَتْ نَفْسُهُ His soul reciprocated in his<br>\
chest at death. (TA.)<br>\
زُلٌّ Slippery: (S:) a place in which one slips;<br>\
(K;) and ↓ زَلَلٌ signifies the same; (S, K;) and<br>\
↓ زَلُولٌ [likewise, i. e.] a place in which the foot<br>\
slips. (TA.) You say مَقَامٌ زُلٌّ and ↓ زَلَلٌ, and<br>\
مَقَامَةٌ زُلٌّ and ↓ زَلَلٌ, [A standing-place] in which<br>\
one slips. (K.) And زُحْلُوقَةٌ زُلٌّ and ↓ زَلَلٌ A<br>\

a subst. from 1 meaning as expl. in the first sentence of this art.; (S, K:) as also ↓ زِلِّيلَى: (S:<br>\
[but this latter is mentioned by Lh and in the K<br>\
as an inf. n.:]) a slip, or lapse; (K:) a fault, a<br>\
wrong action, a mistake, or an error; (Msb, K;)<br>\
or a sin, or crime; (K, * TA;) a fall into sin or<br>\
crime. (Msb in art. عثر.) One says, زَلَّ الرَّجُلُ<br>\
زَلَّةً قَبِيحَةً The man [made a foul slip; or] fell<br>\
into the commission of a disapproved, or hateful,<br>\
or foul, act; or committed an exorbitant, an<br>\
abominable, or a foul, mistake: whence the trad.,<br>\
نَعُوذُ بِاللّٰهِ مِنْ زَلَّةِ العَالِمِ [We seek protection by<br>\
God from the slip of the learned man]: and the<br>\
well-known saying, زَلَّةٌ العَالِمِ زَلَّةُ العَالَمِ [The slip<br>\
of the learned man is the slip of the world at<br>\
large]. (TA.) ―<br>\

(Mgh, * K;) as also ↓ زُلَّةٌ: (K:) a gift. (Msb.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  A feast, or repast, that is prepared for guests.<br>\
(Lth, O, Msb.) One says, اِتَّخَذَ فُلَانٌ زَلَّةً [Such<br>\
a one made, or prepared, a feast for guests].<br>\
(Lth, O, Msb.) Hence, (Lth, TA,) it is also a<br>\
name for Food that is carried from the table of<br>\
one&#39;s friend or relation: a word of the dial. of<br>\
El-&#39;Irák: (Lth, Msb, K:) or in this sense it is a<br>\
vulgar word, (K, TA,) used by the common<br>\
people of El-&#39;Irák (TA.) And i. q. عُرْسٌ [as<br>\
meaning A marriage-feast]. (ISh, Az, Msb, K.)<br>\
So in the saying, كُنَّا فِى زَلَّةِ فُلَانٍ [We were at<br>\
the marriage-feast of such a one]. (ISh, Az,<br>\
Msb, TA.)<br>\
زُلَّةٌ: see زَلَّةٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also A straitened state of the<br>\
breath [unless النَّفَسِ be a mistranscription for<br>\
النَّفْس the soul, which I think not improbable]. (K.)<br>\
زِلَّةٌ Stones: or smooth stones: (K:) pl. زِلَلٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
زَلَلٌ an inf. n. of 1, [q. v,] (Fr, S, Msb, K,) in<br>\
two [or three] senses. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  See also زُلٌّ, in<br>\
four places.<br>\
-A3-  Also A deficiency: so in the<br>\
saying, فِى مِيزَانِهِ زَلَلٌ [In its weight is a deficiency]. (Lh, K.)<br>\
زُلَالٌ A certain animal, of small, white body;<br>\
which, when it dies, is put into water, and renders<br>\
it cool, or cold: (TA:) [Golius describes it as a<br>\
worm that is bred in snow; of which Aristotle<br>\
speaks in his Hist. Animalium, l. ↓. 19; and he<br>\
adds, on the authority of Dmr, that it is of the<br>\
length of a finger, generally marked with yellow<br>\
spots; and swelling in water such as is termed<br>\
ماء الزلال.] ―<br>\
