زَادَ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor. يَزِيدُ, (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. زِيَادَةٌ (S, A, * Msb, K *) and<br>\
زَيْدٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *) with which are syn.<br>\
زِيدٌ (S, K) and زَيَدٌ (K) and مَزِيدٌ (S, K) and<br>\
زَيْدَانٌ, which last is anomalous, like شَنْآنٌ (K)<br>\
and لَيَّانٌ, said to be the only instances of the kind,<br>\
(TA,) all as inf. ns., (TK,) and so is مَزَادٌ, (TA,)<br>\
and J adds that زُوَادَةٌ is mentioned by Yaakoob,<br>\
from Ks, from El-Bekree, as syn. with زِيَادَةٌ, but<br>\
this is a mistake, which is unfairly imputed to J<br>\
by the author of the K, (MF,) [who says,] as to<br>\
الزُّوَادَةُ, it is a mistranscription by J, for the<br>\
words are الزُّوَارَةُ and الزِّيَارَةُ, [in the CK الرُّوادةُ<br>\
and الرِّيادةُ,] with ر, and without the mention of<br>\
[the signification of] النُّمُوُّ, (K, TA,) It (a thing,<br>\
S, Mgh, Msb, [as, for ex.,] water, and property,<br>\
A) increased, or augmented, or grew; (S, A, TA;)<br>\
[and in like manner said of a man, and of any<br>\
animal;] as also ↓ اِزْدَادَ: (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K:)<br>\
or this latter has a more intensive signification<br>\
than the former, like اِكْتَسَبَ in relation to كَسَبَ.<br>\
(MF. [See also 5.]) In this sense it has a single<br>\
objective complement; as in زَادَ كَذَا It, or he,<br>\
increased, or augmented, or grew, in such a thing;<br>\
as also ↓ اِزْدَادَ. (TA.) [The latter is more commonly used in this manner.] You say, ↓ اِزْدَدْتُ<br>\
مَالًا (A, Mgh, Msb) [I increased in property:<br>\
also] meaning I increased to myself, or for myself, property. (Mgh, * Msb.) And الأَمْرُ ↓ ازداد<br>\
صُعُوبَةً [The affair increased in difficulty]. (A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Also It exceeded; it was, or became, redundant, or superfluous; it remained over and above.<br>\
And زَادَ عَلَيْهِ It exceeded it; as also ↓ تزايد.]<br>\
You say, زَادَ عَلَى الشَّىْءِ ضِعْفَهُ [It exceeded the<br>\
thing by the like thereof, or more]. (A.) And<br>\
زَادَ عَلَى مَا أَرَادَ [It exceeded what he desired].<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also He gave an addition: so in the<br>\
saying, فَقَدْ أَرْبَى ↓ مَنْ زَادَ وَازْدَادَ He who gives an<br>\
addition, and who takes it, [each of these] practises usury. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [And He added, or exaggerated.] يَزِيدُ فِى حَدِيثِهِ [He adds, or exaggerates, in his narration, or talk, or discourse,]<br>\
is said of a liar. (A and TA voce سَرَّاجٌ. [See<br>\
also 5.])<br>\
-A2-  It is also trans.: (Msb:) you say,<br>\
زَادَهُ, aor. يَزِيدُهُ, inf. n. زِيَادَةٌ, He increased it, or<br>\
augmented it. (L.) And in this sense it is doubly<br>\
trans.: (MF:) you say, زَادَهُ اللّٰهُ خَيْرًا, (S, K,) or<br>\
مَالًا, (A,) [God increased to him, or added to<br>\
him, good fortune or prosperity or the like, or<br>\
property; increased, or added to, his good fortune, &amp;c.; or may God increase &amp;c.;] as also<br>\
↓ زَيَّدَهُ: (K:) and زَادَ فِيمَا عِنْدَهُ, (S,) or فِى مَالِهِ,<br>\
(A,) [He increased, or added to, what he possessed or his possessions, or his property; or may<br>\
He (i. e. God) increase &amp;c.] ―<br>\
-b2-  زَادَهُ also signifies He gave him an increase, or an addition,<br>\
or more. (Msb.) See 10. ―<br>\
-b3-  You say also, مَا<br>\
يَزِيدُكَ أَحَدٌ عَلَيْهِ [No one is more sufficient for<br>\
thee than he]. (K in art. زند. [See 4 in that<br>\
art.]) And لَا يَزِيدُكَ عَلَيْهِ جَمَلٌ No camel will<br>\
be more sufficient for thee than he; i. q. لَا يَضُرُّكَ.<br>\
(ISk, S in art. ضر [in which see other exs.].)<br>\
2<br>\
زيّد, [inf. n. تَزْيِيدٌ,] said of property, It<br>\
increased, or augmented, much. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also 1, latter part.<br>\
3<br>\
زايد أَحَدُ المُتَبَايِعَيْنِ الآخَرَ, inf. n. مُزَايَدَةٌ,<br>\
[One of the two persons buying together outbade<br>\
the other: see also 6.] (A.)<br>\
5<br>\
تزيّد It (a price, S, A) was, or became,<br>\
excessive, or dear; (S, A, K;) as also ↓ تزايد.<br>\
(A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He added, or exaggerated, (MA,)<br>\
or lied, (S, MA, K,) in narration, or discourse.<br>\
(S, MA. [See also 1, latter half.]) And He<br>\
affected to exceed the due bounds in his narration,<br>\
or discourse, and his speech; (TA;) he affected<br>\
excess in speech, &amp;c.; (K, TA;) i. e. in speech<br>\
and in action; (TA;) as also ↓ تزايد: (K:) or<br>\
التَّزَيُّدُ فِى الحَدِيثِ means the embellishing narration, or discourse, with lies, and adding in it<br>\
what does not belong to it. (Har p. 195.) In the<br>\
verse of &#39;Adee cited in art. زند, the last word is<br>\
تَزَيَّدِ as some relate it, or تَزَنَّدِ as others relate it.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He went a pace exceeding that termed<br>\
العَنَق. (S, K. [See also ذَمَلَ, and نَصَبَ السَّيْرَ,<br>\
and وَسَجَ.]) And تزيّدت She (A camel) stretched<br>\
forth her neck, and went a pace exceeding that<br>\
termed العَنَق, as though she were swimming with<br>\
her rider?? (A, TA:) and in like manner one<br>\
says of a mare, or horse. (TA.) And تزيّدت<br>\
الإِبِلُ فِى سَيْرِهَا The camels tasked themselves in<br>\
their pace beyond their ability. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تزايد [It increased, augmented, or grew,<br>\
gradually; contr. of تَنَاقَصَ]. See also 1. And<br>\
see 5, in two places. تزايدوا عَلَى السِّلْعَةِ [They<br>\
bade, one against another, for the commodity, or<br>\
article of merchandise, successively raising the<br>\
price]: said of the people of a market when a<br>\
commodity is sold to him who bids more than<br>\
others. (L.) And تزايدوا فِى الثَّمَنِ حَتَّى بَلَغَ مُنْتَهَاهُ<br>\
[They augmented the price, one outbidding another,<br>\
until it attained its utmost]. (A, TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِزْدَادَ [originally اِزْتَادَ]: see 1, in four places.<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Also He took an addition. (Msb.) See,<br>\
again, 1. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also He took in addition: so in the<br>\
saying, إِذَا ازْدَادَ الرَّاهِنُ دَرَاهِمَ مِنَ المُرْتَهِنِ [When<br>\
the pledger takes money in addition from the<br>\
receiver of the pledge]. (Mgh.) One says also,<br>\
اِزْدَدْ مِنَ الخَيْرِ [Obtain thou, or gain thou, somewhat in addition of what is good: or it may<br>\
mean seek thou, or desire thou, an increase, or<br>\
addition, of what is good]. (A.) See what next<br>\
follows, in two places.<br>\
10. استزاد He sought, or desired, or demanded,<br>\
an increase, an addition, or more; (A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) as also ↓ اِزْدَادَ; whence the saying, to a<br>\
man to whom a thing has been given, ↓ هَلْ تَزْدَادُ<br>\
Dost thou seek, or desire, or demand, more than<br>\
what I have given thee? (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,] هُوَ<br>\
يَسْتَزِيدُ فِى حَدِيثِهِ [He seeks, or desires, to add,<br>\
or exaggerate, or to exceed the due bounds, or to<br>\
embellish with lies and additions, in his narration,<br>\
or discourse]. (A, TA. [See also 5.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  استزادهُ<br>\
He sought, or desired, or demanded, of him an<br>\
increase, an addition, or more. (Msb, K.) You<br>\
say, ↓ لَوِ اسْتَزَدْتُهُ لَزَادَنِى If I had sought, or desired,<br>\
or demanded, an increase, &amp;c., he had given me<br>\
an increase, &amp;c. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b6-  [And hence,] (tropical:)  He<br>\
reckoned him, or held him, to have fallen short of<br>\
doing what he ought to have done, (S, A, K,<br>\
TA,) and complained of him, (A, TA,) or reproved him, for a thing that he did not approve.<br>\
(TA.) And كَتَبَ إِلَيْهِ كِتَابَ اسْتِزَادَةٍ (tropical:)  [He wrote<br>\
to him a letter of complaint, or reproof, for his<br>\
having fallen short, &amp;c.; requiring him to do<br>\
more]. (A.)<br>\
زَيْدٌ an inf. n. of زَادَ. (S, Mgh, Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] هُمْ زَيْدٌ عَلَى مِائَةٍ (S, A, L) and ↓ زِيدٌ<br>\
(S, L) and ↓ زِياَدَةٌ (A) (tropical:)  [They are more than a<br>\
hundred].<br>\
زِيدٌ an inf. n. of زَادَ. (S, * K, * TK.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See<br>\
the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
زِيَادَةٌ an inf. n. of زَادَ. (S, Msb.) Using it as<br>\
an inf. n., (Msb,) you say, اِفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ زِيَادَةً [meaning Do thou that in addition]: (S, Msb:) the<br>\
vulgar say ↓ زَائِدَةً, (S,) which one should not say.<br>\
(Msb.) [Hence also,] حُرُوفُ الزِّيَادَةِ [The letters<br>\
of augmentation; or the augmentative letters;<br>\
i. e. the letters that are added to the radical<br>\
letters in Arabic words]: they are ten, and are<br>\
comprised in the saying, سَأَلْتُمُونِيهَا [“ Ye asked<br>\
me for them ”], (TA,) and in أَلْيَوْمَ تَنْسَاهُ [“ Today thou wilt forget it ”]; (K, TA;) and more<br>\
than a hundred and thirty other combinations<br>\
comprising them have been mentioned: (MF:)<br>\
[these letters are also called زَوَائِدُ, of which the<br>\
sing. is ↓ زَائِدَةٌ.] See also زَيْدٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [As a simple<br>\
subst., or a subst. properly so termed, it signifies<br>\
An increase, or increment; and augmentation, or<br>\
augment; an addition, additament, adjunct, or<br>\
accessory: an accession: excess, redundance, or<br>\
superfluity: and a redundant part or portion or<br>\
appertenance; a surplus; a residue: an excrescence: pl. زِيَادَاتٌ and زَيائِدُ. ―<br>\
-b3-  Hence,] إِبِلٌ<br>\
كَثِيرَةُ الزَّيَائِدِ i.e. الزِّيَادَات [Camels having much<br>\
increase; lit., much, or many, increases]. (K.)<br>\
A poet says,<br>\
بِهَجْمَةٍ تَمْلَأُ عَيْنَ الحَاسِدِ<br>\
ذَاتِ سُرُوحٍ جَمَّةِ الزَّيَائِدِ<br>\
[With a herd of forty or more camels, that fill,<br>\
or glut, the eye of the envier, enjoying pasturing<br>\
by themselves, having much increase]: some say,<br>\
[in citing this verse,] الزَّوَائِدِ, which is pl. of ↓ زَائِدَةٌ;<br>\
but الزوائد is said only in relation to the legs of a<br>\
beast. (L.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence also,] زِيَادَةُ الكَبِدِ, (so in<br>\
a copy of the S, and in the A and L, and in<br>\
several places in the K,) or الكَبِدِ ↓ زَائِدَةُ, (so<br>\
termed by Zj, and so in the T, and in two copies<br>\
of the S, and in the L,) both of which are correct,<br>\
(TA,) [The redundant appertenance of the liver;]<br>\
a certain small piece to which the liver is attached,<br>\
or suspended: (Zj, in his “ Khalk el-Insán: ”)<br>\
or a certain small appertenance of the liver<br>\
(هُنَيَّةٌ مِنْهَا صَغِيرَةٌ), at its side, going away from it<br>\
(مُتَنَحِّيَةٌ عَنْهَا): (S, L:) or a certain piece appended,<br>\
or attached, to the liver (مُعَلَّقَةٌ بِهَا): (A:) or a<br>\
certain appendage of the liver; [so I render هَنَةٌ<br>\
مُتَعَلِّقَةٌ مِنْهَا, agreeably with the next preceding<br>\
explanation; though it may be rendered a thing<br>\
suspended from it, i.e. from the liver; or the<br>\
right reading may be هنة متعلّقة بِهَا, which is<br>\
virtually the same as the explanation in the A,<br>\
and agreeable with what here follows: so called]<br>\
because it is a redundance (تَزِيدُ) upon its upper<br>\
surface: (L:) [all of these explanations seem to<br>\
denote the round ligament of the liver: the Hebrew<br>\
יֹחֶרֶח הַכּבֵד, in Ex. xxix. 22, literally signifies the same; like the slightly-varying appellations in Ex. xxix. 13 and Lev. iii. 4, and Lev.<br>\
ix. 10: but the real meaning thereof is much<br>\
disputed: the rendering of the LXX. is lobo\s tou*<br>\
h&gt;/patos; which is said to mean extrema pars<br>\
hepatis: that of the Vulg., reticulum hepatis:<br>\
that of our authorized Engl. Vers., the caul above<br>\
the liver; (with this marginal note: “ it seemeth<br>\
by anatomy, and the Hebrew Doctors, to be the<br>\
midriff: ”) and it is remarkable that this is one<br>\
of the meanings assigned to الخِلْبُ, which some<br>\
hold to be syn. with زَيَادَةُ الكَبِدِ: (see خِلْبٌ:)<br>\
Bochart (in his Hieroz. t. i., p. 498, seq.,) and<br>\
Gesenius (in his Lex.) explain the Hebrew term<br>\
as meaning the greater lobe of the liver: but this<br>\
is hard to reconcile with the Hebrew or the<br>\
Arabic; and utterly irreconcileable with the explanations given by the Arabs; among whom, it<br>\
should be observed, were many of the Jewish<br>\
religion, who cannot reasonably be supposed to<br>\
have not known the correct meaning of a term<br>\
relating to their sacrifices:] the pl. of زيادة is<br>\
زَيَائِدُ, (L,) and that of ↓ زائدة is زَوَائِدُ. (S, L.)<br>\
Hence the saying, الوَلَدُ كَبِدُ ذِى الوَلَدِ وَوَلَدُ الوَلَدِ<br>\
زِيَادَةُ الكَبِدِ [The child is as the liver of the parent,<br>\
and the grandchild is as the redundant appertenance of the liver]. (A, TA.)<br>\
زَائِدٌ act. part. n. of زَادَ, (Msb,) [Increasing,<br>\
augmenting, or growing. ―<br>\
-b2-  Exceeding; in excess; redundant; superfluous; remaining over<br>\
and above: excrescent: additional; in addition;<br>\
adscititious.] You say, أَخَذْتُهُ بِدِرْهَمٍ فَزَائِدًا [I<br>\
took it, i. e. bought it, for a dirhem and more].<br>\
(A.) [See also the next paragraph.]<br>\
زَائِدَةٌ [fem. of زَائِدٌ: and also a subst.; being<br>\
transferred from the category of epithets to that<br>\
of substs. by the affix ة: pl. زَوَائِدُ]: see زِيَادَةٌ, in<br>\
five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] الزَّوَائِدُ [Certain excrescences, or pendent hairs, termed] زَمَعَات, in the<br>\
hinder part of the kind leg or foot. (K. [In the<br>\
explanations there given, I read الرِّجْل, as in one<br>\
copy, instead of الرَّحْل. It has been stated above,<br>\
voce زِيَادَةٌ, on the authority of the L, that الزَّوَائِد<br>\
is said only in relation to the legs of a beast.]) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
[But] ذُو الزَّوَائِدِ means The lion: (S, K:) by the<br>\
زوائد being mean this claws and his canine teeth and<br>\
his roaring and his impetuosity. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-  زَائِدَةُ السَّاقِ<br>\
The shin-bone. (L.)<br>\
[<br>\
زَوَائِدِىٌّ a rel. n. from زَوَائِدُ pl. of زَائِدَةٌ; and<br>\
used, app., as meaning Having something redundant; for] Sa&#39;eed Ibn-&#39;Othmán was surnamed<br>\
الزَّوَائِدِىُّ because he had three بَيْضَات: so they<br>\
assert. (S.)<br>\
بُرُودٌ تَزِيدِيَّةٌ, (S, K,) and تَزِيدِيَّاتٌ [alone], (S,)<br>\
[Garments of the kind termed] بُرُود having in<br>\
them red stripes, (S, K,) to which streaks of<br>\
blood are likened: (S:) so called in relation to<br>\
تَزِيد the son of حُلْوَان, the father of a tribe: (S,<br>\
K:) or, as some say, تَزِيد the son of حَيْدَان:<br>\
(MF:) or from تَزِيد, a city, or town, of ElYemen, in which such برود were woven: (TA:)<br>\
or, accord. to some, J and F are in error; and the<br>\
truth is, that there were some merchants in Mekkeh, called بَنُو يَزِيدٍ, thus with ى and in relation<br>\
to them certain [camel-vehicles for women of the<br>\
kind called] هَوَادِج were termed ↓ يَزِيدِيَّةٌ. (MF.)<br>\
مَزَادٌ: see مَزَادَةٌ, in two places.<br>\
مَزِيدٌ an inf. n. of زَادَ. (S, K.) You say, لَا<br>\
مَزِيدَ عَلَى مَا فَعَلْتَ and ↓ لَا مُسْتَزَادَ, (A, Msb,)<br>\
both meaning the same [i.e. There is no exceeding what thou hast done: or rather the latter<br>\
means there is no desire for more than thou hast<br>\
done, or there is no one of whom is desired more<br>\
than thou hast done; for ↓ مُسْتَزَاد may be here<br>\
an inf. n., and it may be a pass. part. n.]. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  [It is also the pass. part. n. of زَادَ, signifying<br>\
Increased, or augmented; as also مَزِيدٌ فِيهِ.]<br>\
مَزَادَةٌ [A leathern water-bag, one of a pair<br>\
which is borne by a camel or other beast;] the<br>\
half (شَطْر) of a رَاوِيَة: (Msb in art. زود:) [a<br>\
water-bag of this kind is represented in a sketch<br>\
of “ Sakkàs ” in my work on the Modern Egyptians:] it has two loops, and two kidney-shaped<br>\
pieces of leather (كُلْيَتَانِ), the former of which<br>\
are sewed to the latter: (TA voce خُرْبَةٌ:) the<br>\
رَاوِيَة consists of two mezádehs (مَزَادَتَانِ), which<br>\
are bound upon the two sides of the camel with<br>\
the [cord called] رِوَآء: the pl. is مَزَايِدُ [often<br>\
written مَزَائِدُ]; and sometimes the Arabs elided<br>\
the ة, saying ↓ مَزَادٌ: (T, TA:) [both of these<br>\
forms are mentioned in the S and K as pls.:] and<br>\
↓ مَزَادٌ without ة, is [also] applied to the single<br>\
one (فَرْدَة [meaning the single water-skin]) which<br>\
the rider attaches behind his camel&#39;s saddle, having<br>\
no عَزْلَآء, [or spout (which is closed by means of a<br>\
thong tied round it) at one of the lower extremities for pouring out the water; thus] differing<br>\
from the مَزَادَة: (T, TA:) or the مزادة is a رَاوِيَة,<br>\
[app. accord. to some who applied this latter term<br>\
to a single water-bag,] (S, A, K,) or only (K)<br>\
such as is composed of two skins with a third<br>\
inserted between them to widen it: (A &#39;Obeyd, S,<br>\
M, A, K:) and so are the سَطِيحَة and the شَعِيب:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, S:) or the سَطيحة is made of two<br>\
skins put face to face; and the مزادة is of two<br>\
skins and a half, or of three skins: (ISh, TA:)<br>\
or it is [a water-bag] joined (مَشْعُربَة) at one side;<br>\
if consisting of two faces (ان خرجت من وجهين<br>\
[i. e. of two pieces of skin whereof each forms one<br>\
face or side]) it is called a شَعِيب: or it is like a<br>\
راوية having no عَزْلَآء [expl. above]: AM and the<br>\
author of the Msb and some others assert that its<br>\
medial radical letter is و, and that it is from<br>\
الزَّوْدُ, (TA,) being so called because one furnishes himself with water in it for travellingprovision: (Msb in art. زود:) but this is a mistake: (TA:) it is thus called because it is<br>\
enlarged by the addition of a third skin: (AO,<br>\
El-Khafájee, TA:) [Fei says that] accord. to<br>\
analogy it should be مِزَادَةٌ. (Msb in art. زود.)<br>\
