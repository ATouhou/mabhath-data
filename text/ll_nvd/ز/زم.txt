from the affecting, &amp;c.]. (Mgh.) ―<br>\

الصِّلِّيَانِ الزَّمْزَمَةُ [Around the صلّيان (a kind of<br>\

(Meyd:) this is a prov., applied to a man who<br>\
hovers round about a thing, and does not make<br>\
apparent his desire: (Meyd, TA:) or to a man<br>\
who is served for the sake of his wealth: (Meyd:)<br>\
the صلّيان is one of the most excellent kinds of<br>\
pasture: and the prov. means that the cries and<br>\
clamour that one hears are for the desire of what<br>\
is to be eaten and enjoyed: Z says, (TA,) the<br>\
صلّيان is cut for the horses that do not quit<br>\
the tribe; (Meyd, TA;) and they neigh, or<br>\
whinny, (تُزَمْزِمُ, and تُحَمْحِمُ,) around it: (TA:)<br>\
some relate it otherwise, saying حَوْلَ الصُّلْبَانِ<br>\

fastens, or makes fast: (K:) meaning [the noserein of a camel; i. e.] the cord that is tied to the<br>\
بُرَة [or خِزَام, each meaning nose-ring of a camel],<br>\
or to the خِشَاش [or wooden thing fixed in the<br>\
bone of the nose], and to which, (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA,) i. e. to the end of which, (S, TA,) is tied the<br>\
مِقْوَد [or leading-rope]: (S, Mgh, Msb, TA:) and<br>\
(afterwards, Msb) also applied to the مِقَوْد (S, Msb,<br>\
TA) itself: (Msb:) pl. أَزِمَّةٌ. (Msb, K.) [See<br>\
also خِطَامٌ.] It is said in a trad., لَا زِمَامَ وَلَا خِزَامَ<br>\
فِى الإِسْلَامِ [There shall be no nose-rein nor nosering by which to lead a man in El-Islám]:<br>\
meaning a practice of the devotees of the Children<br>\
of Israel, who used to attach rings and reins to<br>\
the noses, like as is done to the she-camel in order<br>\
that she may be led thereby. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
زِمَامُ الأَمْرِ (assumed tropical:)  That by means of which the thing, or<br>\
affair, subsists, and is conducted, or managed,<br>\
and ordered. (TA.) And أَلْقَى فِى يَدِهِ زِمَامَ أَمْرِهِ<br>\

conducting his affair, or the conduct of his affair]:<br>\
and يُصَّرِفُ أَزِمَّةَ الأُمُورِ (assumed tropical:)  [He disposes as he pleases<br>\
the various means of conducting the affairs].<br>\
(TA.) And هُوَ عَلَى زِمَامٍ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He is on the<br>\
point of accomplishing his affair. (TA.) And<br>\
النَّاقَةُ زِمَامُ الإِبِلِ (assumed tropical:)  [The she-camel is the leader of<br>\
the other camels]: said when she goes before<br>\
them. (TA.) And هُوَ زِمَامُ قَوْمِهِ (assumed tropical:)  [He is the<br>\
leader of his people, or party]: and هُمْ أَزِمَّةٌ قَوْمِهِمْ<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  [They are the leaders of their people, or party].<br>\
(TA.) [See also De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe, sec.<br>\

-b3-  زِمَامُ النَّعْلِ (assumed tropical:)  [The زمام of the sandal]<br>\
is the thing to which the شِسْع is attached, or<br>\
tied: (S:) or the thong that is between the middle<br>\
toe and that next to it, to which the شِسْع is<br>\
attached, or tied: [but for the latter of these explanations, it seems that we should read the thong<br>\
that is between the middle toe and that next to it:<br>\
or the thong to which the شِسْع is attached, or<br>\
tied: the شِسْع being the thong that passes through<br>\
the sole, and between two of the toes, and to which<br>\
the شِرَاك is attached: for it appears that the term<br>\
زِمَام is applied by some to the thong called by<br>\
others the شِرَاك, extending between the leg and the<br>\
toes: and by some, to what is called by others the<br>\
شِسْع, or قِبَال: to the latter as being likened to<br>\
the cord that is tied to the camel&#39;s nose-ring; and<br>\
to the former as being likened to the leading-rope<br>\
which is tied to that cord: it being] a metaphorical<br>\
term, from the زِمَام of the camel: (Mgh:) it is<br>\
[said to be] the thong lies upon the back<br>\
[meaning upper side] of the foot, [extending]<br>\
from, or [consisting] of, the fore part of the<br>\
شِرَاك, lengthwise: [for the term شِرَاك (q. v.) is<br>\
sometimes used in a larger sense than that above<br>\
assigned to it:] or it is like the قِبَال, [which is<br>\
expl. in the same manner as the شِسْع, i. e., as]<br>\
being between the middle toe and that next to it:<br>\
(Har p. 539:) [and thus it is expl. by J and Mtr<br>\
and F in another art.;] the قِبَال of the sandal is<br>\
its زِمَام, (S, and Mgh and K in art. قبل,) i. e.<br>\
its thong which is (Mgh in that art.) between the<br>\
middle toe and next to it. (S and Mgh and<br>\
K in that art.)<br>\

name at Mekkeh]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  زَمْزَمٌ or زَمْزَمُ (accord. to different copies of the S, [used by a poet<br>\

it is app. a fem. proper name, and therefore<br>\
imperfectly decl.,]) is also A name of, or for, a<br>\
