wrapped (تُزَمَّلُ i. e. تُلَفُّ) with a piece of cloth of<br>\
coarse flax, or some other thing, between which<br>\
and the jar is straw: it is in their houses in the<br>\

by means of the [porous earthen bottles called]<br>\
بَرَّادَات; then it is poured into this مزمّلة, and<br>\
remains in it cool. (Har p. 548.)<br>\
