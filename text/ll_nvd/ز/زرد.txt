strange; (TA;) He swallowed (S, A, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K) a morsel, or mouthful, (S, A, Msb, K,) or<br>\
water, (Mgh,) [and medicine; for] you say دَوَآءٌ<br>\
↓ صَعْبُ المُزْدَرَدِ [A medicine difficult to swallow].<br>\
(A, TA.) And one says of a man swearing,<br>\
حَصَّآءَ ↓ تَزَرَّدَهَا and تَزَبَّدَهَا حَذَّآءَ (tropical:)  [He swallowed<br>\
it; meaning, took it hastily; i. e. the oath].<br>\

of mail, by inserting the rings one into another;<br>\
i. q. سَرَدَهَا: (K:) الزَّرْدُ is like السَّرْدُ, meaning the<br>\
inserting (تَدَاخُل [an intrans. inf. n. here used as<br>\
though it were trans., as is shown in the S in art.<br>\
سرد,]) of the rings of a coat of mail, one into<br>\
another: (S:) [or, as Z says,] زَرْدُ الدِّرْعِ means<br>\
سَرْدُهَا, because the coat of mail consists of narrow,<br>\
or close, rings: (A:) the ز is said to be a substitute for س. (L, TA.)<br>\

زرّد عَيْنَهُ عَلَى صَاحِبِهِ (tropical:)  He was angry with<br>\
his companion, and looked sternly, austerely, or<br>\

mail, a piece of mail, and rings in general, like<br>\
سَرْدٌ, q. v.], (A,) and ↓ زَرَدِيَّةٌ: (mentioned as syn.<br>\
with دِرْعٌ in art. درع in the Msb and in the TA,<br>\
