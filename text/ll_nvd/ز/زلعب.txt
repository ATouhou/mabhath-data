اِزْلَعَبَّ, (K,) inf. n. اِزْلِعْبَابٌ, (S in art.<br>\
زعب,) said of a torrent, It was, or became,<br>\
copious, and impelled in its several parts, or<br>\
portions, by the impetus of one part, or portion,<br>\
acting upon another. (S, K.) Accord. to the S,<br>\
and AHei, the ل is augmentative; [as it is said<br>\
with equal reason to be in اِزْلَغَبَّ;] but accord. to<br>\
the K, it is radical, and therefore this is its<br>\
proper place, not art. زعب. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q.<br>\
اِزْلَغَبَّ, [q. v.,] said of hair. (TA in art. زلغب.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And ازلعبّ السَّحَابُ The clouds were, or became,<br>\
dense, or thick. (K.)<br>\
مُزْلَعِبٌّ A torrent that is copious, and impelled<br>\
in its several parts, or portions, by the impetus of<br>\

or many small particles or fragments [borne on<br>\
its surface]. (TA.) [See also زَاعِبٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also a<br>\
dial. var. of مُزْلَغِبٌّ, [q. v.,] applied to a young<br>\
