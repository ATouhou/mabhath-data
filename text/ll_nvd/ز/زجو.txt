زَجَا, (S, K,) aor. يَزْجُو, (S,) inf. n. زَجَآءٌ (S,<br>\
K, and Ham p. 78) and زَجْوٌ (K and Ham) and<br>\
زُجُوٌّ, (K,) It (a thing) went, or became urged on<br>\
or along, quickly. (Ham ubi suprà: there indicated by the context, but not expressed.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It<br>\
(a bad piece of money) passed, or had currency.<br>\
(Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  It (an affair) was, or became, easy; and right, in a right state, or right<br>\
in its direction or tendency. (K, TA.) Hence<br>\
the trad., لَا تَزْجُو صَلَاةٌ لَا يُقْرَأُ فِيهَا بِفَاتِحَةِ الكِتَابِ<br>\
i. e. [A prayer in which the opening chapter of<br>\
the Book (meaning the Kur-án) is not recited]<br>\
will not be right. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, inf. n. زَجَآءٌ,<br>\
said of the [tax called] خَرَاج, It was, or became,<br>\
easy of collection. (S.) ―<br>\
-b5-  زَجَآءٌ also signifies The<br>\
acting with penetrative energy, and effectiveness,<br>\
in an affair. (S, K.) One says, هٰذَا الأَمْرُ قَدْ<br>\
زَجَوْنَا عَلَيْهِ [app. meaning This affair, we have<br>\
effected it, or accomplished it; like as one says,<br>\
مَضَيْنَا عَلَى الأَمْرِ]. (T, TA.) And عَطَآءٌ قَلِيلٌ يَزْجُو<br>\
خَيْرٌ مِنْ كَثِيرٍ لَا يَزْجُو [A small gift that is effective is better than much that will not be effective].<br>\
(S.)<br>\
-A2-  One says also, ضَحِكَ حَتَّى زَجَا i. e. [He<br>\
laughed until] his laughing became stopped, or<br>\
cut short. (S, K. *)<br>\
-A3-  See also what next follows,<br>\
in two places.<br>\
2<br>\
زجّاهُ, (S, Msb, TA,) inf. n. تَزْجِيَةٌ, (S, TA,)<br>\
He pushed it gently, (S, Msb, TA,) in order that<br>\
it might go on; as also ↓ ازجاهُ; and ↓ زَجَاهُ, aor.<br>\
يَزْجُوهُ, inf. n. زَجْوٌ: and this last, he drove it, or<br>\
urged it on, gently; (TA;) [and so زجّاهُ and<br>\
↓ ازجاهُ, as will be shown by what follows:] or<br>\
↓ زَجَاهُ signifies [simply] he drove it, or urged it<br>\
on: and he pushed it: and so [app. in both of<br>\
these senses] زجّاهُ and ↓ ازجاهُ. (K.) Hence, i. e.<br>\
from زَجَّيْتُهُ meaning “ I pushed it gently,” (Har<br>\
p. 304,) one says, كَيْفَ تُزَجِّى الأَيَّامَ (S, Har) i. e.<br>\
كَيْفَ تُدَافِعُهَا [How dost thou strive with the days in<br>\
pushing them on, or making them to pass away?]:<br>\
(S:) or كيف تَدْفَعُهَا [how dost thou push on the<br>\
days? and thus may mean also كيف تدافعها]:<br>\
(Har:) [or how dost thou make the days to pass<br>\
away? for] زجّى الأَيَّامَ means he made the days<br>\
to pass away: (MA:) [or how dost thou pass the<br>\
days? for it is also said that] تَزْجِيَةٌ signifies the<br>\
passing [one&#39;s] days. (KL.) [زجّى الأَيَّامَ may<br>\
be well rendered He made the days to pass away<br>\
by means of exertion; and so دَفَعَهَا and دَافَعَهَا.<br>\
Har (ubi suprà) uses the phrase أُزَجِّى أَيَّامًا مُسْوَدَّةً<br>\
as meaning I push on evil and hard days.] ↓ ازجى<br>\
الشَّىْءَ, also, inf. n. إِزْجَآءٌ, is expl. by Az as signifying دَافَعَ بِقَلِيلِهِ [app. meaning He strove to<br>\
push on life, or to repel want or the like, with<br>\
little of the thing]: and accord. to a saying heard<br>\
by him from a man of the tribe of Fezárah,<br>\
نُزَجِّىدُنْيَانَا [or the correct reading may be<br>\
↓ نُزْجِى, and accord. to either reading the phrase<br>\
may be rendered We strive to push on life, or to<br>\
repel want &amp;c., with little of our worldly possessions,] means we content ourselves in respect of<br>\
our worldly possessions with scanty sustenance.<br>\
(TA. [See also 5.]) One says also CCC الإِبِلَ ↓ أَزْجَيْتُ<br>\
I drove the camels. (S.) And CCC وَلَدَهَا ↓ البَقَرَةُ تُزْجِى<br>\
The [wild] cow drives her young one. (S.) الرِّيحُ<br>\
السَّحَابَ ↓ تُزْجِىِ CCC The wind drives along the clouds:<br>\
(S:) or drives along gently the clouds; as also<br>\
تُزَجِّيهِ, but in an intensive sense. (Msb.) In like<br>\
manner, سَحَابًا ↓ يُزْجِى is said of God, in the Kur<br>\
[xxiv. 43]: and in the same [xvii. 68], رَبُّكُمُ الَّذِى<br>\
لَكُمُ الْفُلْكَ فِى البَحْرِ ↓ يُزْجِى CCC [Your Lord is He<br>\
who driveth along for you the ship in the sea].<br>\
(TA.) And a poet says,<br>\
↓ زَجَّيْتُهُ بِالقَوْلِ وَازْدَجَيْتُهُ<br>\
i. e. [I drove him with speech, and] urged him<br>\
on: for اِزْدَجَاهُ signifies سَاقَهُ [like زَجَّاهُ &amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And زجّى حَاجَتِى He made easy the<br>\
attainment of my want. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  زجّى الرُّمْحَ<br>\
i. q. أَزَجَّهُ q. v. in art. زج. (TA in that art.)<br>\
4<br>\
أَزْجَوَ see 2, in ten places. ازجى also signifies<br>\
He made money, or bad money, to pass, or be<br>\
current. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَزَجَّيْتُ بِكَذَا I contented myself with such a<br>\
thing: a rájiz says,<br>\
تَزَجَّ مِنْ دُنْيَاكَ بِالبَلَاغِ<br>\
[Content thyself with what is sufficient of thy<br>\
worldly possessions]. (S. [See also 2.])<br>\
8<br>\
إِزْتَجَوَ see 2, near the end of the paragraph.<br>\
أَزْجَى More penetrating and effective in an<br>\
affair than another: (S, K:) so in the saying,<br>\
فُلَانٌ أَزْجَى بِهٰذَا الأَمْرِ مِنْ فُلَانٍ [Such a one is<br>\
more penetrating and effective in this affair than<br>\
such a one]. (S, K. *)<br>\
مُزْجًى, applied to a horse [or other beast], That<br>\
is driven, or urged on, (يزجى, [i. e. يُزْجَى,]) in<br>\
his pace, by little and little. (Ham p. 158.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
A small, or scanty, thing; (S, Er-Rághib, TA;)<br>\
or such as is mean, or paltry; that may be<br>\
pushed and driven away because of the little<br>\
account that is made of it. (Er-Rághib, TA.)<br>\
بِضَاعَةٌ مُزْجَاةٌ means Small, or scanty, merchandise; little in quantity: (S, K:) and so it is<br>\
said to mean in the Kur [xii. 88]: or, as in some<br>\
copies of the S, little, or mean, or paltry, merchandise: (TA:) or mean, or paltry, merchandise, rejected by every one to whom it is<br>\
offered: (A, TA:) or merchandise wherewith the<br>\
days are pushed on (تُدْفَعُ [i. e. made to pass away<br>\
by means of exertion]) because of its scantiness:<br>\
(Msb, TA: [for مُزْجَاةٌ بِهَا:]) or, accord. to the<br>\
shereef El-Murtadà, merchandise driven along<br>\
portion after portion, scantily and feebly: (TA:)<br>\
or merchandise in respect of which a lowering of<br>\
the price is demanded on account of its badness<br>\
(فِيهَا إِغْمَاضٌ); (Th, TA;) not in perfect condition: (Th, K, TA:) thus, too, it is expl. as used<br>\
in the Kur: and some say that what is there<br>\
mentioned consisted of fruit of the terebinth-tree,<br>\
or of صَنَوْبَر [app. here meaning pine-cones]: some<br>\
say, of commodities of the Arabs of the desert,<br>\
wool, and clarified butter: and some say, of deficient pieces of money. (TA.)<br>\
مُزَجًّى Weak: so termed because of his lagging<br>\
behind, and requiring to be urged on: (Ham<br>\
p. 441:) or anything not perfect in nobility, nor<br>\
in any other praiseworthy quality: or, as some<br>\
say, one driven to generosity against his will:<br>\
(TA:) and also, (TA,) applied to a man, i. q.<br>\
مُزَلَّجٌ [q. v., app. here meaning deficient in manliness, or manly virtue, or the like]. (S, TA.)<br>\
[الزَّمَانُ المُزَجَّى, a phrase used by Har, is expl.<br>\
(p. 429) as meaning حَقُّهُ أَنْ يُزَجِّيهِ النَّاسُ, i. e.<br>\
Time that requires men to push it on, or to make<br>\
it to pass away by means-of exertion.]<br>\
مِزْجَآءٌ A man who urges on much the camel, or<br>\
beast, that he rides. (TA.)<br>\
