it, away; (S, * Mgh, * Msb, K, * TA;) namely, a<br>\

thing. (M, * TA.) You say of a she-camel, تَزْبِنُ<br>\
حَالِبَهَا She pushes, or thrusts, or she pushes, or<br>\
thrusts, away, her milker. (Mgh, Msb, TA.)<br>\

occasion of being milked: زَبْنٌ being [generally]<br>\
with the stifle-joints; and رَكْضٌ, with the hind<br>\

pushed, or thrust, them away; put them away,<br>\
or removed them from their place. (TA.) And<br>\
of war, or battle, (حَرْب,) one says, تَزْبِنُ النَّاسِ,<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  It dashes men [one against another],<br>\
and pushes, or thrusts, them. (S, TA.) ―<br>\

us thy present &amp;c. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  زَبْنٌ also signifies<br>\
The selling any fruit upon its trees for [other]<br>\
fruit by measure: (K:) whence ↓ المُزَابَنَةُ (see 3):<br>\
it has been forbidden, because of the fraud, or<br>\
deceit, and the ignorance, attending it: and is thus<br>\
termed because either of the two parties, when<br>\
he repents, repels the other [if able to do so]<br>\
from the obligation that he has imposed upon<br>\
him. (TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
زابنهُ, (K,) inf. n. مُزَابَنَهٌ, (TA,) i. q. دَافَعَهُ<br>\
[He contended, or strove, with him in pushing,<br>\

their fresh ripe state (S, K) upon the heads of<br>\
the palm-trees for dried dates (S, Mgh, Msb, K)<br>\
by measure; (Mgh, Msb;) which is forbidden,<br>\
because it is a sale by conjecture, [or] without measuring and without weighing: (S, TA:) it is from<br>\
الزَّبْنُ; because it leads to contention and mutual<br>\
repulsion: (Mgh:) and in like manner, the selling<br>\
any fruit upon its trees for fruit by measure:<br>\
see 1, last sentence: (TA:) accord. to Málik, any<br>\
selling or buying of a thing by conjecture, not<br>\
knowing its measure nor its number nor its weight,<br>\
for something named of that which is measured<br>\
and weighed and numbered: or the selling of a<br>\
thing known for a thing unknown of its kind:<br>\
or the selling of a thing unknown for a thing unknown of its kind: or a buying and selling in<br>\
which is a mutual endeavour to endamage, or<br>\
overreach, (بَيْعُ مُغَابَنَةٍ,) in a kind in which endamaging, or overreaching, is not allowable; (K;)<br>\
because, in this case, he who is endamaged, or<br>\
overreached, desires to annul the sale, and he who<br>\
endamages, or overreaches, desires to make it take<br>\
effect, so they repel one another, and contend.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

him as such;] meaning a simpleton, or fool; one<br>\
much, or often, endamaged, or overreached, defrauded, or deceived; as also ↓ تزبّنهُ: (Mgh:)<br>\
or استزبنهُ and ↓ تزبّنهُ are like اِسْتَغْبَنَهُ and تَغَبَّنَهُ<br>\
[both app. meaning he esteemed him غَبِين, i. e.<br>\
weak in judgment, and therefore liable to be endamaged, or overreached, defrauded, or deceived;<br>\
like as استضعفهُ and تضعّفهُ both signify “ he<br>\
esteemed him ضَعِيف, i. e. weak ”]; or like اِسْتَغْبَاهُ<br>\
and تَغَبَّاهُ [both app. meaning he esteemed him unintelligent, or one having little intelligence]. (TA.)<br>\

زَبَنٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  مَقَامُ زَبْنٍ A narrow standing-place, upon<br>\
which a man cannot stand by reason of its<br>\
narrowness and slipperiness. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [In one<br>\
place in the CK, الزَّبْنُ is erroneously put for<br>\
الزَّبِنُ.]<br>\
زِبْنٌ: see زَبَنٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also A want, or thing<br>\
wanted: you say, قَدْ أَخَذَ زِبْنَهُ مِنَ المَالِ, i. e.<br>\
[He has taken] what he wanted [of the property],<br>\
(K,) and مِنَ الطَّعَامِ [of the food]. (TA.)<br>\
زَبَنٌ A side; a lateral, or an adjacent, part or<br>\
tract or quarter: (K:) [and so, app., ↓ زَبْنٌ and<br>\
↓ زِبْنٌ: for] you say, حَلَّ زَبْنًا مِنْ قَوْمِهِ, with<br>\
fet-h, [as well as زَبَنًا, with two fet-hahs,] and زِبْنًا,<br>\
with kesr, meaning He alighted aside, or apart,<br>\
from his people, or party; as though he were<br>\
thrust from their place: scarcely ever, or never,<br>\

-A2-  Also A piece of<br>\
cloth [shaped] after the fashion of the tent (عَلَى<br>\
تَقْطِيعِ البَيْتِ), like the حَجَلَة [a kind of curtained<br>\
canopy prepared for a bride]. (K.)<br>\
زَبِنٌ, (K, TA,) like كَتِفٌ, (TA, [الزَّبْنٌ in the<br>\
CK being a mistranscription for الزَّبِنُ,]) Vehement in pushing, or thrusting; and so ↓ زُبُنٌّ.<br>\
(K, * TA.)<br>\
زِبْنِيَةٌ: see زَبَانِيَةٌ.<br>\
زِبْنِىٌّ: see زَبَانِيَةٌ.<br>\
زُبُنٌّ: see زَبِنٌ.<br>\
زُبُنَّةٌ The hind leg of a she-camel: (TA:) the<br>\
hind legs of the she-camel are called زُبُنَّتَاهَا (K,<br>\
TA) because she pushes, or thrusts, with them.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
زَبُونٌ One who pushes, or thrusts, or who<br>\
pushes, or thrusts, away, [or who pushes &amp;c.<br>\
much or vehemently, or who is wont to push &amp;c.,]<br>\
a thing. (Msb.) A she-camel that pushes, or<br>\
thrusts, or that pushes, or thrusts, away, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) or that kicks, or strikes, and pushes,<br>\
&amp;c., (S, TA,) her milker, (S, Mgh, Msb, K, *)<br>\
with her hind leg (Msb) [or with her stifle-joint:<br>\
see 1]: or that is wont, or accustomed, to push,<br>\
&amp;c., her milker. (TA.) Hence, (A,) one says<br>\
حَرْبٌ زَبُونٌ (S, A, Msb, K) meaning (tropical:)  A difficult,<br>\
or stubborn, war or battle; likened to the she-camel<br>\
termed زبون: (A, TA:) or that dashes men [one<br>\
against another], and pushes, or thrusts, them: (S:)<br>\
or in which one portion pushes, or thrusts, or pushes<br>\
or thrusts away, another, by reason of multitudinousness: (K:) or it is thus called because<br>\
it repels the valiant men from advancing, through<br>\
fear of death. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  As meaning غَبِىٌّ [i. e.<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  Unintelligent, or having little intelligence], and<br>\
حَرِيفٌ [syn. with مُعَامِلٌ, and hence, as will be<br>\
seen from what follows, app. here used in the<br>\
sense of (assumed tropical:)  a dealer with others in buying and<br>\
selling, a meaning which مُعَامِلٌ often has, though,<br>\
as I have shown in art. حَرف, I do not know any<br>\
authority for assigning this meaning to حَرِيفٌ],<br>\
(S, K, [the latter explanation thus written in my<br>\
copies of the S and in my MS. copy of the K and<br>\
in the CK, but in the TA, and hence in the TK,<br>\
خريف, which has no meaning, that I know of,<br>\
appropriate in this instance,]) it is post-classical,<br>\
(K,) not of the language of the people of the<br>\
desert: (S:) it signifies (tropical:)  a simpleton, or fool,<br>\
who is endamaged, or defrauded, (يُغْبَنُ,) much;<br>\
by a tropical attribution [of the meaning of a<br>\
pass. part. n. to a word which has properly the<br>\
meaning of an act. part. n.; because the person<br>\
thus termed is as though he were pushed, or<br>\
thrust, away]: (Mgh:) it signifies also (assumed tropical:)  a purchaser; because he pushes away another from the<br>\
thing that is sold; [or because he is often duped;]<br>\
and in this sense, [a sense in which it is commonly<br>\
now used, or as meaning a customer, and also a<br>\
dupe,] it is a post-classical word, not of the language of the people of the desert. (Msb.) [The<br>\
pl. now commonly used is زَبَائِنُ, and some say<br>\
زَبُونَاتٌ.] It is said in a post-classical prov., الزَّبُونُ<br>\
يَفْرَحُ بِلَا شَىْءٍ [which I would render (assumed tropical:)  The dupe<br>\
rejoices without anything, or at nothing]: (Meyd:)<br>\
or الزَّبُونُ يَفْرَحُ بِأَدْنَى شَىْءٍ, meaning [(assumed tropical:)  The dupe<br>\
rejoices at the least, or the meanest, thing: or]<br>\
the dealer (المُعَامِلُ), or the purchaser (المُشْتَرِى),<br>\
as the word signifies in the dial. the people of<br>\
El-Basrah. (Har p. 76, q. v. [The editors of the<br>\
sec. ed. of De Sacy&#39;s Har, to which reference is<br>\
here made, say, (Notes, p. 90,) “ Nous pensons<br>\
que le mot الزبون, dans l&#39;acception qu&#39;il prend<br>\
dans ce proverbe dérive du chaldéen<br>\
זַבֵּן &#39;vendre.&#39;”<br>\
(This verb is written in the Lex. of Gesenius<br>\
זְבַן.) See also De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe, sec. ed.,<br>\
pp. 186 — 190.]<br>\
-A2-  Also A well in which is a receding in its مَثَابَة [or place where the water<br>\
collects, or place reached by the water when it<br>\
returns and collects after one has drawn from it,<br>\
&amp;c.; (see art. ثوب;) as though its casing were<br>\
pushed back in that part]. (K.)<br>\
-A3-  And [An<br>\
inner vest; so in the present day; pl. أَزْبِنَةٌ;] a<br>\
thing that is cut so as to fit the body, and worn.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
زُبَانَى is the sing. of which زُبَانَيَانِ is the dual.<br>\
(Mz, 40th نوع.) زُبَانَى العَقْرَبِ signifies The horn<br>\
[or claw] of the scorpion: (Msb:) its two horns<br>\
[or claws] are called زُبَانَيَا العَقْرَبِ; (S, K;) because it pushes with them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
الزُّبَانَيَانِ, (Ibn-Kunáseh, S, Kzw,) or زُبَانَيَا العَقْرَبِ,<br>\
(K,) [the former the more common,] (assumed tropical:)  The two<br>\
horns [or claws] of Scorpio; [which, like the<br>\
constellation Leo, the Arabs extended much beyond<br>\
the limits that we assign to it, and which they<br>\
thus made to include a portion of Libra;] (Kzw;)<br>\
two stars, widely separated, (Ibn-Kunáseh, Kzw,)<br>\
[that rise] before الإِكْلِيل [q. v.]; (Ibn-Kunáseh;)<br>\
between which (Ibn-Kunáseh, Kzw) is the measure<br>\
of a spear (رُمْح [q. v.]), more than the stature of<br>\
a man, (Ibn-Kunáseh,) [or,] in appearance, the<br>\
measure of five cubits: (Kzw:) two bright stars,<br>\
(S, K,) in, or upon, (K,) the two horns [or claws]<br>\
of Scorpio: (S, K:) [a and g of Libra, accord.<br>\
to those who make النَّوْء to mean “ the auroral<br>\
setting; ” and perhaps the same, or<br>\
α and<br>\
β of<br>\
Libra, accord to those who make النَّوْء to mean<br>\
“ the auroral rising: ”] one of the Mansions of<br>\
the Moon, (S, Kzw,) namely, the Sixteenth<br>\
Mansion. (Kzw. [See مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل.])<br>\
The saying<br>\
عَضَّ بِأَطْرَافِ الزُّبَانَى قَمَرُهْ<br>\
[lit. His moon bit the extremities of the claw of<br>\
Scorpio], cited by IAar, is expl. as meaning “ he<br>\
is uncircumcised, except the part from which the<br>\
قَمَر has contracted; ” his قُلْفَة being likened to<br>\
the زُبَانَى [and his كَمَرَة to the قَمَر]: and he is<br>\
related to have said that he who is born when the<br>\
moon is in Scorpio is unprosperous: but Th says,<br>\
I asked him respecting this saying, and he disallowed it, and said, No, but he is a low, or mean,<br>\
or sordid, person, who does not give food in<br>\
winter; and when the moon [in winter] bites the<br>\
extremities of the زُبَانَى, [i. e. enters Scorpio,] it<br>\
is most intense cold. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also زَبَانِيَةٌ.<br>\
زَبَانٍ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
زَبَانِيَةٌ is a pl., of which the sing. is ↓ زِبْنِيَةٌ,<br>\
(Akh, Zj, S, K,) as some say, or ↓ زَبَانٍ, (Akh, S,)<br>\
or ↓ زُبَانَى, like سُكَارَى, (TA,) or ↓ زَابِنٌ, (Akh, S,)<br>\
or ↓ رِبْنِىٌّ, (Ks, K,) the pl. of this last being originally زَبَانِىُّ, the ة [in زَبَانِيَةٌ] being substituted<br>\
for the [last] ى: (Bd in xcvi. 18:) but the Arabs<br>\
hardly, or in nowise, know this [attribution of a<br>\
sing. to زَبَانِيَةٌ], holding it to be a pl. having no<br>\
sing., like أَبَابِيلُ and عَبَادِيدُ. (Akh, S.) With<br>\
the Arabs [of the classical age] it signifies The<br>\
شُرَط [app. in the earlier sense of the braves of an<br>\
army, or in the later sense of the armed attendants,<br>\
officers, or soldiers, of the prefect of the police]:<br>\
(S:) this is the primary signification: (Bd in<br>\
xcvi. 18:) the sing. being syn. with شُرْطِىٌّ: and<br>\
also signifying the مُتَمَرِّد [i. e. one who exalts<br>\
himself, or is insolent and audacious, in pride and<br>\
in acts of rebellion or disobedience, &amp;c.,] of the<br>\
jinn, or genii, and of mankind: (K:) and i. q.<br>\
شَدِيدٌ [i. e. strong, &amp;c.]: (Secr, K:) each of these<br>\
two significations [and the first also] being from<br>\
the meaning of “ pushing,” or “ thrusting. ” (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  الزَّبَانِيَةُ signifies also Certain angels, [the tormentors of the damned in Hell,] so called because<br>\
of their thrusting the people of the fire thereto;<br>\
(Katádeh, S, Msb; *) the angels mentioned in the<br>\
Kur [lxvi. 6] as غِلَاظٌ شِدَادٌ, (Zj,) i. e. rough in<br>\
speech or in disposition, strong in deeds or in<br>\
make. (Bd.)<br>\
[<br>\
زَبَّانٌ is said by Freytag to signify a foot<br>\
(“ pes ”), as on the authority of J; as though he<br>\
had found it expl. by the word رِجْل: but this is<br>\
a mistake: it is said in the S that زَبَّانٌ is the<br>\
name of a man (اِسْمُ رَجُلٍ).]<br>\
زِبِّينٌ One striving to suppress the urine and<br>\
ordure: (K, * TA: [the word, with the article ال,<br>\
is expl. by مُدَافِعُ الأَخْبَثَيْنِ: see 3 in art. دفع, and<br>\
see also أَخْبَثُ:]) such is said in a trad. to be one<br>\
of those from whom prayer will not be accepted;<br>\
or, as some relate it, it is the زِنِّين, with ن [in<br>\
the place of the ب]: (TA:) or it means one<br>\
withholding them against his will. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  One<br>\
says also, مَا بِهَا زِبِّينٌ, meaning There is not in it<br>\
[i. e. the house, الدَّار,] any one: so says Aboo-Shubrumeh. (TA.)<br>\
زَبُّونَةٌ Pride; syn. كِبْرٌ. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,<br>\
probably,] رَجُلٌ ذُو زَبُّونَةٍ i. q. مَانِعٌ جَانِبَهُ [app.<br>\
meaning A man who defends his honour, or reputation: see جَانِبٌ]: (S, TA:) or a man who<br>\
defends what is behind his back (مَا وَرَآءَ ظَهْرِهِ<br>\
[perhaps meaning his household: see ظَهْرٌ]). (TA,<br>\
and so in a copy of the S.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, and ↓ زُبُّونَةٌ,<br>\
The neck; (IAar, K;) as in the saying خُذْ<br>\
بِقُرُونِهِ وَبِزَبُّونَتِهِ [Take thou hold of his horns and<br>\
his neck]: (IAar, TA:) or زَبُّونَةٌ may signify the<br>\
ear; and the pl. زَبُّونَاتٌ, the head and neck of a<br>\
horse, by a metonymy, because the ears are<br>\
therein. (Ham p. 58, q. v.)<br>\
زُبُّونَةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
زَابِنٌ: see زَبَانِيَةٌ, first sentence.<br>\
زَابِنَةٌ An [eminence such as is termed] أَكَمَة,<br>\
(K, TA,) raised high (TA) in a valley that bends,<br>\
or turns, from it; (K, TA;) as though it pushed<br>\
it, or thrust it, away. (TA.)<br>\
