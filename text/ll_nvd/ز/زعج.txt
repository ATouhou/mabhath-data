زَعَجَ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q. طَرَدَ [He drove<br>\
away, &amp;c.]. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  And [i. q. زَعَقَ, meaning]<br>\
He called, called out, cried out, or shouted. (K.)<br>\
4<br>\
ازعجهُ He disquieted, disturbed, agitated, or<br>\
flurried, him; (IDrd, S, K;) and removed him<br>\
from his place: (S, A, Msb, K:) and ↓ زَعَجَهُ<br>\
signifies the same. (IDrd, K.) You say, أَزْعَجْتُهُ<br>\
عَنْ مَوْضِعِهِ, (Msb,) or مِنْ مَحَلِّهِ, (A,) and مِنْ<br>\
بِلَادِهِ, (L,) I removed him, or unsettled him,<br>\
from his place, and from his country. (A, L,<br>\
Msb.) And it is said in a trad., رَأَيْتُ عُمُرَ يُزْعِجُ أَبَا<br>\
بَكْرٍ, meaning I saw &#39;Omar rousing Aboo-Bekr,<br>\
and not suffering him to remain still. (TA.)<br>\
And in another, الحَلِفُ يُزْعِجُ السِّلْعَةَ وَيَحْمَقُ البَرَكَةَ,<br>\
meaning, accord. to Az, [Swearing] lowers in<br>\
estimation [the commodity that one desires to<br>\
recommend thereby and does away with the<br>\
blessing thereof]: or, accord. to IAth, causes it to<br>\
be easy of sale and to go forth from the hand of<br>\
its owner [but does away with the blessing thereof]. (TA.) إِزْعَاجٌ [is the inf. n.; and as inf. n. of<br>\
the pass. verb,] signifies [The being disquieted, &amp;c.;<br>\
and hence,] the quitting of home. (Har p. 392.)<br>\

انزعج He was, or became, disquieted, disturbed, agitated, or flurried; (S, K;) and was,<br>\
or became, removed, or unsettled, from his place:<br>\
(S, A, L, Msb, K:) it may be thus used as quasipass. of ازعج: (Kh, Msb:) or it should not be<br>\
so used: (Msb:) it is, however, agreeable with<br>\
analogy, as is also ↓ ازدعج: (L:) but the word<br>\
commonly used in its stead is شَخَصَ: (L, Msb:)<br>\
زَعَجَ in this sense is not allowable. (L.)<br>\
8<br>\
ازدعج: see what next precedes.<br>\
زَعَجٌ Disquietude, disturbance, or agitation:<br>\
(K, TA:) a subst. [not an inf. n.] in this sense.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مِزْعَاجٌ An unquiet woman, who remains not<br>\
still, or settled, in one place. (S, A, K.)<br>\
