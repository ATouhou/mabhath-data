زَلَفَ: see 2:<br>\
-A2-  and see also 8, in three places.<br>\
2<br>\
زلّفهُ, (O, TA,) inf. n. تَزْلِيفٌ, (O,) He did it<br>\
previously, or beforehand; namely, a thing;<br>\
(IAar, O, TA;) as, for instance, an evil action;<br>\
(O, TA;) and so ↓ زَلَفَهُ; (IAar, TA;) syn. أَسْلَفَهُ,<br>\
(O, TA,) and قَدَّمَهُ. (IAar, O, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  زلّف<br>\
النَّاسَ, inf. n. as above, He disquieted, or agitated,<br>\
the people, step by step: (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, Z, O, TA:)<br>\
accord. to Z, said of a guide. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  زلّف فِى<br>\
حَدِيثِهِ, (inf. n. as above, K,) He added, or exaggerated, in his discourse, or narration; (IDrd,<br>\
O, K;) as also ذرّف. (IDrd, O.)<br>\
4<br>\
ازلفهُ He made, brought, or drew, him, or it,<br>\
(namely, a thing, TA,) near. (S, Mgh, Msb, TA.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [xxvi. 90 and 1. 30], وَأُزْلِفَتِ<br>\
الْجَنَّةُ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ And Paradise shall be brought<br>\
near to the pious: meaning, accord. to Zj, that<br>\
their entrance thereinto shall become near, and<br>\
their view thereof. (TA.) [بِهِ ↓ ازدلف also signifies the same as ازلفه (agreeably with analogy);<br>\
as is shown by what here follows:] it is said in a<br>\
trad. of Mohammad El-Bákir, مَا لَكَ مِنْ عَيْشِكَ إِلَّا<br>\
لَذَّةٌ تَزْدَلِفُ بِكَ إِلَى حِمَامِكَ [i. e. There is not remaining to thee, of thy life, save a pleasure that<br>\
brings thee near to thy predestined term]. (O,<br>\
TA.) And ↓ ازدلفهُ means He, or it, brought him<br>\
near to destruction. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He collected<br>\
it together; (Msb, TA;) namely, a thing. (Msb.)<br>\
Hence, in the Kur [xxvi. 64], وَأَزْلَفْنَا ثَمَّ الآخَرِينَ<br>\
[And we collected there the others]. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَزَلَّفَ see the next paragraph.<br>\
8<br>\
اِزْدَلَفَ, (Mgh, Msb,) originally اِزْتَلَفَ, (Msb,)<br>\
or اِزْدَلَفُوا, and ↓ تزلّفوا, (S, O, L, K,) He, or they,<br>\
approached, or drew near: (Mgh, O, L, Msb,<br>\
TA: in the K, تَفَرَّقُوا is erroneously put for تَقَرَّبُوا:<br>\
TA:) or (O, accord. to the K “ and ”) advanced;<br>\
or went forward, or before: (S, O, K:) إِلَيْهِ [to<br>\
him, or it], (Mgh, K,) and مِنْهُ [which means the<br>\
same, as after دَنَا &amp;c.]: (TA, and Har p. 452:)<br>\
[and ↓ زَلَفَ and زَلَفُوا, inf. n. app. زَلْفٌ and زَلَفٌ,<br>\
signify the same: for] you say also, إِلَيْهِ ↓ زَلَفَ<br>\
He drew near to him, or it: and لَهُ ↓ زَلَفْنَا We<br>\
advanced, or went forward, to him, or it: (TA:)<br>\
and زَلْفٌ signifies the act of advancing, or going<br>\
forward, (A&#39;Obeyd, S, TA,) from place to place;<br>\
as also زَلَفٌ. (TA.) One says, ازدلف السَّهْمُ إِلَى<br>\
كَذَا The arrow approached, or drew near, to<br>\
such a thing. (Msb.) And it is said in a trad.,<br>\
فَإِذَا زَالَتِ الشَّمْسُ فَاْزْدَلِفْ إِلَى اللّٰهِ فِيهِ بِرَكْعَتَيْنِ,<br>\
meaning تَقَرَّبْ [i. e., When the sun declines from<br>\
the meridian, then seek thou to draw near unto<br>\
God therein by means of the prayers of two<br>\
rek&#39;ahs]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 4, in two places.<br>\
زَلْفٌ: see زُلْفَةٌ.<br>\
زُلْفٌ: see its accus. case voce زُلْفَةٌ, near the end<br>\
of the paragraph.<br>\
زِلْفٌ A meadow; syn. رَوْضَةٌ; (TS, K;) and so<br>\
↓ زَلَفَةٌ: (IB, TA:) thus the latter is expl. as occurring in a trad. relating to Ya-jooj and Ma-jooj,<br>\
in which it is said, ثُمَّ يُرْسِلُ اللّٰهُ مَطَرًا فَيَغْسِلُ الأَرْضَ<br>\
حَتَّى يَتْرُكَهَا كَالزَّلَفَةِ [Then God will send rain,<br>\
and it will wash the earth so that it will leave<br>\
it like the meadow]: but in this instance, several<br>\
other meanings are assigned to it: see زَلَفَةٌ below.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
زَلَفٌ: see زُلْفَةٌ, in two places:<br>\
-A2-  and see also<br>\
زَلَفَةٌ, in five places.<br>\
زُلُفٌ: see its accus. case voce زُلْفَةٌ, near the end<br>\
of the paragraph.<br>\
زُلْفَةٌ i. q. قُرْبَةٌ [i. e. Nearness, with respect to<br>\
rank, degree, or station]; (S, Mgh, O, Msb, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ زُلْفَى, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,) and ↓ زَلَفٌ.<br>\
(IDrd, O, K.) [It would seem that it means also<br>\
Nearness with respect to place or situation: for<br>\
SM immediately adds,] hence, in the Kur [lxvii. 27],<br>\
فَلَمَّا رَأَوْهُ زُلْفَةً, [as though meaning But when they<br>\
shall see it in a state of nearness: but] Zj says<br>\
that the meaning is, but when they shall see it<br>\
(i. e. the punishment) near (قَرِيبًا): and several<br>\
authors say that زُلْفَةٌ is sometimes used in the<br>\
sense of قَرِيبٌ, as is stated in the &#39;Ináyeh. (TA.)<br>\
And Station, rank, grade, or degree; as also<br>\
↓ زُلْفَى, (S, O, K, TA,) and ↓ زَلْفٌ, (TS, K,) and<br>\
↓ زَلَفٌ: (K, TA:) pl. of the first زُلَفٌ: (S, * TA:)<br>\
or (K) ↓ زُلْفَى is a quasi-inf. n.; (S, K;) and such<br>\
it is in the saying in the Kur [xxxiv. 36], وَمَا<br>\
أَمْوَالُكُمْ وَلَا أَوْلَادُكُمْ بِالَّتِى تُقَرِّبُكُمْ عِنْدِنَا زُلْفَى, as<br>\
though meaning ازْدِلَافًا [i. e. And neither your<br>\
riches nor your children are what will bring you<br>\
near to us in advancement: but here it may be<br>\
well rendered, in station]: (S:) accord. to Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Arafeh, زُلْفَى signifies the bringing very near:<br>\
(TA:) the saying of Ibn-El-Tilimsánee that it is<br>\
pl. of زُلْفَةٌ is very strange, and unknown; the<br>\
correct pl. of this last word being زُلَفٌ. (MF,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A portion (S, K) of the first part<br>\
(S) of the night, (S, K,) whether small or large:<br>\
so accord. to Th: or, accord. to Akh, of the<br>\
night absolutely: (TA:) pl. زُلَفٌ and زُلَفَاتٌ (S, K)<br>\
and زُلُفَاتٌ and زُلْفَاتٌ: or زُلَفٌ signifies the hours,<br>\
or periods, (سَاعَات,) of the night, commencing<br>\
from the daytime, and the hours, or periods, of<br>\
the daytime, commencing from the night: (K:)<br>\
and its sing. is زُلْفَةٌ. (TA.) وَزُلَفًا مِنَ اللَّيْلِ, in<br>\
the Kur [xi. 116], means And at sunset and nightfall (the مَغْرِب and the عِشَآء): (Zj, TA:) some<br>\
read ↓ زُلُفًا, with two dammehs; which may be a<br>\
sing., like حُلُمٌ; or a pl. of زُلْفَةٌ, like as بُسُرٌ is of<br>\
بُسُرَةٌ, with damm to the س in each: [but this is<br>\
not a parallel instance; for بُسُرٌ is a coll. gen. n.<br>\
of which بُسُرَةٌ is the n. un., and the latter is not<br>\
of the same measure as زُلْفَةٌ:] and some read<br>\
↓ زُلْفًا, which is a pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.] of<br>\
زُلْفَةٌ, like as دُرٌّ is of دُرَّةٌ; (K, TA;) or pl. of<br>\
↓ زَلِيفٌ, like as قُرْبٌ is of قَرِيبٌ, and غُرْبٌ of<br>\
غَرِيبٌ: (TA:) and some read ↓ زُلْفَى, in which<br>\
the alif [written ى] is a denotative of the fem.<br>\
gender. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also the next paragraph.<br>\
زَلَفَةٌ A full [reservoir of water such as is called]<br>\
مَصْنَعَة: (S, K:) pl. [or rather coll. gen. n.]<br>\
↓ زَلَفٌ: (S:) so, accord. to Sh, in the trad. mentioned voce زِلْفٌ: (TA:) or ↓ زَلَفٌ signifies full<br>\
watering-troughs, (K,) as pl. [or coll. gen. n.] of<br>\
زَلَفَةٌ: (TA:) or a full watering-trough. (K.)<br>\
Also A [bowl such as is called] صَحْفَة: (K;) and<br>\
so ↓ زُلْفَةٌ; (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K;) of which the pl. is<br>\
زُلَفٌ: (TA:) or a full صَحْفَة; and its pl. [or coll.<br>\
gen. n.] is ↓ زَلَفٌ. (Lth, TA.) Also A green<br>\
[vessel of the kind called] إِجَّانَة: (K:) so says<br>\
AO: pl. [or coll. gen. n.] ↓ زَلَفٌ; and ↓ مَزَالِفُ<br>\
likewise signifies green أَجَاجِين [app. as an anomalous pl. of زَلَفَةٌ or of زَلَفٌ, like as مَشَابِهُ is of<br>\
شَبَهٌ]; both, also, mentioned on the authority of<br>\
AO. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A mother-of-pearl-&#39;shell, or<br>\
an oyster-shell; syn. صَدَفَةٌ: (K:) Kt says that<br>\
الزَّلَفَة in the trad. mentioned above voce زِلْفٌ has<br>\
been expl. as meaning the مَحَارَة, i. e. the صَدَفَة;<br>\
but he adds, I know not this explanation, unless a<br>\
pool of water be called محارة because the water<br>\
returns (يَحُورُ) to it and collects in it. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also A smooth rock: (K:) so, too, said to mean<br>\
in the same trad.: and some read الزلقة. (TA.)<br>\
And Rugged ground. (K.) And Swept ground.<br>\
(K.) And An even part of a soft mountain. (K.)<br>\
Pl. (K) [or rather coll. gen. n.] in all these senses<br>\
(TA) ↓ زَلَفٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b4-  See also زِلْفٌ. ―<br>\
-b5-  Also A<br>\
mirror: (O, K: [in the CK, المَرْأَةُ is put in the<br>\
place of المِرْآةُ:]) [like زَلَقَةٌ:] mentioned by IB<br>\
on the authority of Aboo-&#39;Amr Ez-Záhid, and by<br>\
Sgh on that of Ks: and so, too, it is said to mean<br>\
in the trad. mentioned above; the earth being<br>\
likened thereto because of its evenness and cleanness: (TA:) or the face thereof; (K;) as is said<br>\
by IAar. (TA.)<br>\
زُلْفَى: see زُلْفَةٌ, in four places.<br>\
عُقْبَةٌ زَلُوفٌ [A stage of a journey] far-extend-<br>\
ing: (O, K:) so says IF. (O.) [In the CK,<br>\
عَقَبَةٌ is erroneously put for عُقْبَةٌ.]<br>\
زَلِيفٌ Advancing; or going forward, or before.<br>\
(O, K. [It is said in the TA that المُتَقَدِّمُ as the<br>\
explanation of الزَّلِيفُ is erroneously put in the<br>\
copies of the K for التَّقَدُّمُ: but this assertion is<br>\
app. itself erroneous.]) See زُلْفَةٌ, near the end of<br>\
the paragraph.<br>\
[<br>\
أَزْلَفُ expl. by Golius as on the authority of the<br>\
KL, and by Freytag after him, as meaning Parvo<br>\
naso præditus ejusque recto ac parvo mucrone, is<br>\
a mistake for أَذْلَفُ, thus written in my copy of<br>\
the KL.]<br>\
[<br>\
أَزْلَفَةٌ and أَزْلَفَى expl. by Freytag as meaning<br>\
Copia parva, cœtus hominum parvus, as on the<br>\
authority of El-Meydánee, are app. mistakes for<br>\
أَزْفَلَةٌ and أَزْفَلَى.]<br>\
مَزْلَفَةٌ Any town (قَرْيَةٌ) that is between the desert<br>\
and the cultivated land: pl. مَزَالِفُ: (S, * K:)<br>\
the latter is syn. with بَرَاغِيلُ, signifying the towns<br>\
(بِلَاد) that are between the cultivated land and<br>\
the desert; (S;) or, between the desert and the<br>\
بَحْر [i.e. sea or great river]; such as El-Ambár<br>\
and El-Kádiseeyeh. (M, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [The pl.] مَزَالِفُ<br>\
also signifies Places of ascent; or steps, or stairs,<br>\
by which one ascends: (K:) because they bring<br>\
one near to the place to which he ascends. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  For the pl. مَزَالِفُ, see also زَلَفَةٌ.<br>\
