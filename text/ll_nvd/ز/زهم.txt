or each, (K,) the name of A certain dog. (S,<br>\
K, &amp;c.) It is said in a prov., زَادُهُ ↓ فِى بَطْنِ زَهْمَانَ<br>\
In the belly of the dog زهمان is his provision: applied to a man who has with him his apparatus, and<br>\
what he needs: or, accord. to AA, the case was<br>\
this: a man slaughtered a camel, and divided it,<br>\
and gave to [one whose name was] زهمان his<br>\
share, and then زهمان returned to receive again<br>\
with the [other] people; and it is applied to a<br>\
man who seeks a thing when he has received<br>\
once: (Meyd:) Z says that زَهْمَانُ is the name of<br>\
a man who came to a people that had slaughtered<br>\
a camel, and asked them to give him some food<br>\
thereof, and they gave it him: then he returned<br>\
to them, and they said to him thus, meaning<br>\
“ Thou has had thy provision thereof, and it is in<br>\
thy belly; ” and it is applied to any one who has<br>\
received his share of a thing, and then come, after<br>\
that, seeking it: or, as some relate it, it is with<br>\
damm, [↓ زُهْمَان] and is applied to one who is<br>\
invited to a repast when he is satiated: or it<br>\
relates to one suffering from indigestion: or زهمان<br>\
is the name of a dog; and it originated from the<br>\
fact that a man prepared for himself some provision, and was unmindful of it, and a dog ate it;<br>\
and it is applied to him for whom there is no<br>\
share. (Z cited by Freytag ubi suprà.)<br>\

زُهُومَةٌ The odour of fat and stinking flesh-meat;<br>\
(JK, K; [and mentioned also, but not explained,<br>\
in the S;]) as also ↓ زُهْمَةٌ: (K:) or the latter<br>\
signifies a fetid odour [in a general sense]: (S:)<br>\
but accord. to Az, the former signifies the disagreeableness of odour, without the being fetid,<br>\
or altered [for the worse]; such as the odour of<br>\
lean flesh-meat, or the odour of the flesh of a beast<br>\
of prey, or strong-smelling sea-fish; the fish of the<br>\
rivers having no زهومة. (TA.) [See also 1, first<br>\
sentence; and رُهْمٌ, last signification; and زَهَمٌ.]<br>\
