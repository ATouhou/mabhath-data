of the KL, “i. q. Pers. چكانيد, Fecit ut stillaret,<br>\
stillatim emisit: ” but it appears from my copy of<br>\
the KL that this should be زهّق; for I there find<br>\
تَزْهِيقٌ (not تَزْرِيقٌ) expl. by the Pers. چكانيدن:<br>\
then, however, immediately follows, in that copy,<br>\
another explanation: ―<br>\
-b2-  and The shifting backwards of a camel&#39;s saddle from his back: therefore it seems that either تَزْرِيقٌ is there omitted<br>\
before this second explanation, (see 1, last sentence but one, and see 7,) or تَزْهِيقٌ is there a<br>\
mistake for تَزْرِيقٌ.]<br>\

لَا يُقَاسُ الزُّرَّقُ بِالأَزْرَقِ [The زُرَّق is not to be compared with the أَزْرَق], which latter is the بازى:<br>\
(TA:) the pl. is زَرَارِيقُ. (S, K.)<br>\

a she-camel,] نِعْمَتْ زَوْرَقُ البَلَدِ; [making it fem.,<br>\
because] meaning نِعْمَتْ سَفِينَةُ المَفَازَةِ [Excellent,<br>\

Black: and is applied to a horse, an ass, a mule,<br>\
a bird, and any animal, and sometimes to other<br>\
things, as meaning gray, or ash-coloured.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[And Blind; properly by reason of a bluish, or<br>\

means [And we will congregate, or raise to life,<br>\
on that day, the sinners, or unbelievers,] blind;<br>\

blue, or gray, by reason of intense thirst: (ISd,<br>\
TA:) or blue-eyed, or gray-eyed, (زُرْقَ العُيُونِ,) because الزُّرْقَةُ is the worst of the colours of the eye,<br>\
and the most hateful thereof to the Arabs, for<br>\
the Greeks were their greatest enemies, and are<br>\
زُرْق. (Bd.) ―<br>\

blades of arrows &amp;c. (Ham p. 313.) And Clear<br>\
water: (IAar, S, Msb:) pl. as above. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
Hence, العَدُوُّ الأَزْرَقُ The sheer enemy: or [the<br>\
fierce enemy;] the enemy that is vehement in<br>\
hostility; because زُرْقَة of the eyes is predominant<br>\
in the Greeks and the Deylem, between whom<br>\
and the Arabs is a confirmed enmity. (Har p. 148.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  الأَزْرَقُ The بَازِى [i. e. hawk, or falcon: because<br>\

&#39;Alee committed an act of infidelity by submitting<br>\
his case to arbitration, and that Ibn-Muljam&#39;s<br>\
slaughter of him was just; and they pronounced<br>\
the Companions [of the Prophet] to have been<br>\
guilty of infidelity. (TA.)<br>\

Msb, K,) lighter than the عَنَزَة. (Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
