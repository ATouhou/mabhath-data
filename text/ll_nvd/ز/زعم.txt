زَعَمَ, (S, Msb,) aor.<br>\
زَعُمَ, (Msb, MS, JM, [not<br>\
mentioned in the S nor in the K, app. because<br>\
well known,]) inf. n. زَعْمٌ and زُعْمٌ and زعْمٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) the first of the dial. of El-Hijáz, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) the second of the dial. of [the tribe of] Asad,<br>\
(Msb,) or Benoo-Temeem, (TA,) and the third<br>\
of the dial. of some of [the tribe of] Keys; (Msb;)<br>\
[generally best rendered He asserted; for it mostly<br>\
relates to a thing not certainly known: or] he<br>\
said; (S, Msb, K;) as in the phrases زَعَمَتِ<br>\
الحَنَفِيَّةٌ [The Hanafees said or asserted, or have<br>\
said or asserted,] and زَعَمَ سِيبَوَيْهِ [Seebaweyh said<br>\
or asserted, or has said or asserted]; (Msb;)<br>\
[and زَعَمَ أَنَّهُ كَذَا He said, or asserted, that it<br>\
was thus;] either truly or falsely: (K:) mostly<br>\
used in relation to a thing respecting which there<br>\
is doubt, (Sh, Az, Msb, K,) and which is not<br>\
certainly known: (Sh, Az, Msb:) or it is mostly<br>\
used in relation to that which is false, or that<br>\
respecting which there is doubt, or suspicion:<br>\
(El-Marzookee, Msb:) or, as those skilled in the<br>\
language of the Arabs say, in relation to a thing<br>\
of which the speaker doubts, and does not know<br>\
whether it may not be false: (Lth:) or زَعَمَ زَعْمًا<br>\
means he related a piece of information not knowing whether it were true or false. (IKoot, Msb.)<br>\
Hence the saying, زَعَمَ مَطِيَّةُ الكَذِبِ [i. e. (assumed tropical:)  زَعَمَ is<br>\
the conveyer, or vehicle, (properly the camel, or<br>\
beast, that serves as the conveyer,) of lying]. (Msb.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., بِئْسَ مَطِيَّةُ الرَّجُلِ زَعَمُوا [(assumed tropical:)  Very<br>\
evil, or bad, is the man&#39;s conveyer زَعَمُوا]: i. e.,<br>\
when a man desires to journey to a country, or<br>\
town, he mounts his camel, or beast, that serves<br>\
to convey him, and journeys until he accomplishes the object of his want: therefore, that<br>\
with which the speaker prefaces his speech, and<br>\
by means of which he attains the object of his<br>\
desire, when he says زَعَمُوا كَذَا وَكَذَا, is likened<br>\
to the camel, or beast, by means of which he<br>\
attains the object of want: for زَعَمُوا is [generally]<br>\
said only in the case of a narration that has no<br>\
authority whereon to rest, and that contains no<br>\
proof. (TA.) IKh says that الزَّعْمُ is used in relation to that which is discommended; and that its<br>\
primary signification is said by some of the expositors of the Kur-án to be The act of lying:<br>\
(TA: [this signification is also given in the K,<br>\
as being contr. to the first:]) some say that it is<br>\
metonymically used in this sense: (Msb:) and<br>\
it is expl. as having this meaning in the Kur<br>\
[vi. 137], where it is said, فَقَالُوا هٰذَا لِلّٰهِ بِزَعْمِهِمْ,<br>\
i. e. [And they have said, “This belongeth unto<br>\
God,”] with their lying. (Lth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Sometimes] زَعَمَهُ signifies He described him, or it.<br>\
(Har p. 204.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And sometimes زَعَمَ signifies<br>\
He promised: whence the saying of &#39; Amr Ibn-Sha-s,<br>\
تَقُولُ هَلَكْنَا إِنْ هَلَكْتَ وَإِنَّمَا<br>\
عَلَىاللّٰهُ أَرْزَاقُ العِبَادِ كَمَا زَعَمْ<br>\
[Thou sayest, or she says, “We perish if thou<br>\
perish: ” but verily upon God lie the means of<br>\
subsistence of mankind, i. e. it lies upon Him to<br>\
supply these, as He has promised]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
الزَّعْمُ is used also in the sense of الظَّنُّ: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) one says, فِى زَعْمِى كَذَا [In my opinion<br>\
it is thus]. (Msb.) [Hence, likewise,] زَعَمْتَنِى<br>\
كَذَا, (K,) aor. تَزْعُمُنِى, (TA,) Thou thoughtest<br>\
me to be thus. (K, TA.) Aboo-Dhu-eyb says,<br>\
فَإِنْ تُزْعُمِينِى كُنْتُ أَجْهَلُ فِيكُمُ<br>\
فَإِنِّى شَرَيْتُ الحِلْمَ بَعْدَكِ بِالجَهْلِ<br>\
[And if thou think me such that I used to be<br>\
ignorant, or to act ignorantly, among you, know<br>\
that I have purchased intelligence since I was<br>\
with thee (بَعْدَكِ being for بَعْدَ عَهْدِى بِكِ) in exchange for ignorance]. (TA. [The meaning of<br>\
تزعمينى is there indicated by the context.]) ―<br>\
-b5-  It<br>\
is also used in the sense of الاِعْتِقَادُ: whence the<br>\
saying in the Kur [lxiv. 7], زَعَمَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُو أَنْ<br>\
لَنْ يُبْعَثُوا [They who have disbelieved our revelations have believed, or firmly believed, that they<br>\
shall not be raised from the dead]. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
Sometimes, also, زَعَمَ is used in the sense of شَهِدَ:<br>\
as in the saying of En-Nábighah,<br>\
زَعَمَ الهُمَامُ بِأَنَّ فَاهَا بَارِدٌ<br>\
[app. meaning The magnanimous chief bore witness that her mouth was cool]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  زَعَمَ بِهِ,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
زَعُمَ (S, Msb) and<br>\
زَعَمَ, (Msb,)<br>\

latter is a simple subst., (Msb,) He was, or<br>\
became, responsible, answerable, amenable, surety,<br>\
or guarantee, for it; (S, Msb, K;) namely, property. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And زَعَمَ, like قَتَلَ, (Msb,) or<br>\
زَعُمَ, like كَرُمَ, (TA,) aor.<br>\
زَعُمَ, inf. n. زَعَامَةٌ, He<br>\
was, or became, chief, lord, master, or prince,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) of a people, (TA,) or عَلَى قَوْمٍ [over<br>\
a people]; (Msb;) or spokesman of a people.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A3-  See also 4, in two places.<br>\
-A4-  زَعِمَ,<br>\
aor.<br>\
زَعَمَ, (S, K,) inf. n. زَعَمٌ (S, TA) and زَعْمٌ, (TA,)<br>\
He coveted, or eagerly desired. (S, K.) [Like its<br>\
syn. طَمِعَ, it is trans. by means of فِى.] One<br>\
says, ↓ زَعِمَ فُلَانٌ فِى غَيْرِ مَزْعَمٍ, i. e. طَمِعَ فى غَيْرِ<br>\
مَطْعَمٍ [Such a one coveted a thing not to be<br>\
coveted; meaning, a thing of which the attainment was remote, or improbable: see art. طمع].<br>\
(TA.) And &#39; Antarah says,<br>\
عُلِّقْتُهَا عَرَضًا وَأَقْتُلُ قَوْمَهَا<br>\
زَعَمًا لَعَمْرُ أَبِيكَ لَيْسَ بِمَزْعَمِ<br>\
(S,) i. e. I became enamoured of her unintentionally, [or accidentally,] while I was slaying her<br>\
people; eagerly desiring her love: by the life of<br>\
thy father, I swear, this is not a [fit] occasion<br>\
for eager desire: i. e. I can not attain to holding<br>\
communion of love with thee, [or with her,] any<br>\
day, while there is this conflict and hostility between the two tribes: (EM p. 222:) لَيْسَ بِمَزْعَمٍ<br>\
meaning لَيْسَ بِمَطْمَعٍ : (S:) or, [as some relate it,]<br>\
زَعْمًا وَرَبِّ البَيْتِ لَيْسَ بِمَزْعَمِ<br>\
[eagerly desiring: by the Lord of the House (i. e.<br>\
the Kaabeh), &amp;c.]. (TA. [زَعْمًا is there expressly<br>\
said to be thus: but the measure does not require<br>\
its being so.])<br>\
3<br>\
زاعم, (K,) inf. n. مُزَاعَمَةٌ, (TA,) i. q. زَاحَمَ<br>\
[q. v.]: (K:) the ع is a substitute for the ح.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
ازعم He made a person to be such as is<br>\
termed زَعِيم; (Msb, TA;) as meaning responsible, answerable, amenable, surety, or guarantee.<br>\
(Msb.) You say, أَزْعَمْتُكَ المَالَ, (Msb,) or الشَّىْءَ,<br>\
(TA,) I made thee, or have made thee, responsible, &amp;c., (Msb, TA, *) [for the property, or the<br>\
thing;] i. e. زَعِيمًا بِهِ. (Msb, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  He made<br>\
one to covet, or eagerly desire. (S, K.) You say,<br>\
أَزْعَمْتُهُ. (S.) [And أَزْعَمْتُهُ فِى الشَّىْءِ I made him<br>\
to covet, or eagerly desire, the thing; like as you<br>\
say, أَطْمَعْتُهُ فِيهِ. See زَعِمَ.]<br>\
-A3-  He obeyed (K,<br>\
TA) the زَعِيم [i. e. chief, lord, or prince]. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  It (an affair) was, or became, possible. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  It (milk) began to become good, or pleasant;<br>\
[or fit to be drunk;] as also ↓ زَعَمَ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
زَعْمٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  ازعمت said of a young she-camel,<br>\
or of one full-grown, She was thought to have<br>\
fat in her hump. (IKh, TA. [The TA states it<br>\
to have been asserted by IKh that the verb is<br>\
only used in this sense, or (for the passage is<br>\
ambiguous) in this sense and the first mentioned<br>\
above.]) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, (K,) or ↓ زَعَمَتْ, (TA, [but this<br>\
I think to be probably a mistranscription,]) said of<br>\
the earth, or land, (الأَرْضُ,) It put forth the first<br>\
of its plants, or herbage. (IAar, K, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تزعّم i. q. تَكَذَّبَ [q. v.]: (S, K:) [it seems<br>\
here to mean He spoke falsely; and to be trans.;<br>\
for] a poet says,<br>\
أَيُّهَا الزَّاعِمُ مَا تَزَعَّمَا<br>\
[app. meaning O thou asserter of that which thou<br>\
hast spoken falsely]. (TA. [This hemistich is<br>\
there cited as an ex. of تزعّم as expl. in the K;<br>\
and I find no other explanation of this verb.])<br>\
6<br>\
تَزَاعَمَا They two competed in discoursing of<br>\
a thing, and differed respecting it: accord. to Z,<br>\
it means they talked of, or related, زَعَمَات, i. e.<br>\
[mere assertions, or] stories in which no confidence was to be placed. (TA.) Sh says that<br>\
التَّزَاعُمُ is mostly used in relation to a thing respecting which there is doubt. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  One<br>\
says also, تزاعم القَوْمُ, meaning The people, or<br>\
party, became responsible, one for another: and<br>\
hence, تزاعموا عَلَى كَذَا they leagued together,<br>\
and aided one another, against such a thing. (TA.)<br>\
زُعْمٌ [originally an inf. n. of زَعَمَ, like زَعْمٌ and<br>\
زِعْمٌ,] is a word used by the vulgar as meaning<br>\
كِبْرٌ [i. e. Pride; and, as often used in the present<br>\
day, pretension: because implying false, or vain,<br>\
assertion]. (TA.)<br>\
زَعَمٌ and ↓ زَعَامَةٌ Responsibility, answerableness,<br>\
amenableness, or suretiship; substs. from زَعَمَ بِهِ :<br>\
(Msb:) or the latter is an inf. n. (S, K.)<br>\
زَعِمٌ, applied to roasted meat, (K, TA,) Dripping<br>\
with its gravy; or succulent, and dripping with<br>\
its juice or fat; (TA;) having much grease, or<br>\
gravy; quickly flowing [therewith] over the<br>\
fire. (K.)<br>\
زَعْمَةٌ [inf. n. of un. of زَعَمَ; An assertion; &amp;c.:<br>\
pl. زَعَمَاتٌ]. One says, هٰذَا وَلَا زَعْمَتَكَ and ولا<br>\
زَعَمَاتِكَ [meaning This I think, and I think not<br>\
to be true thine assertion and thine assertions];<br>\
أَتَوَهَّمُ being understood after لا : these words are<br>\
used as meaning the rejection of what has been<br>\
said by the person to whom they are addressed.<br>\
(K, TA. [In the CK, erroneously, زَعْمَتِكَ and<br>\
زَعْمَاتِكَ.]) They said also, زَعْمَةٌ صَادِقَةٌ لَآتِيَنَّكَ [i. e.<br>\
It is a true assertion: I will assuredly come to<br>\
thee]; using the nom. case : though they said,<br>\
يَمِينًا صَادِقَةً لَأَفْعَلَنَّ [i. e. I swear “ a true oath :<br>\
I will assuredly do ” such a thing]; using the<br>\
accus. case. (Ks, TA.) And one says, تَحَادَثَا<br>\
بِالزَّعَمَاتِ, meaning They two talked of, or related,<br>\
each to the other, [mere assertions, or] stories in<br>\
which no confidence was to be placed. (Z, TA.)<br>\
زُعْمِىٌّ (with damm, TA) Mendacious: and<br>\
veracious: (K:) thus bearing two contr. significations. (TA.)<br>\
زُعْمُومٌ : see the next paragraph.<br>\
زَعُومٌ, a fem. epithet, (S, K, &amp;c.,) applied to a<br>\
she-camel, and to a sheep or goat, Of which one<br>\
doubts whether there be in her fat or not, (S, K,)<br>\
and which is therefore felt with the hands, in<br>\
order that one may know if she be fat or lean:<br>\
(S:) or a sheep or goat of which one knows not<br>\
whether there be in her fat or not: (As, TA:)<br>\
or, as some say, of which men assert that there<br>\
is in her marrow. (TA.) And, as a fem. epithet,<br>\
Having little fat: and having much fat: thus<br>\
bearing two contr. senses: as also ↓مُزْعَمَةٌ [app.<br>\
in both senses]: (M, K:) and ↓مَزْعُومَةٌ also<br>\
signifies having little fat; of which people, when<br>\
they eat of her, say to her owner, “Didst thou<br>\
assert her to be fat? ” applied to a she-camel.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Impotent in speech; (K;) and so<br>\
↓زُعْمُومٌ. (S, * K.)<br>\
زَعِيمٌ Responsible, answerable, amenable, surety,<br>\
or guarantee. (S, Msb, K.) Hence, in the Kur<br>\
[xii. 72], وَأَنَا بِهِ زَعِيمٌ [And I am responsible for<br>\
it]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The chief, lord, master, or<br>\
prince, or a people; (Msb, K;) or [in the CK<br>\
“ and ”] their spokesman: (K:) their chief is thus<br>\
called because he speaks for them; like as he is<br>\
called قَيْلٌ and مِقْوَلٌ: (Ham p. 705:) pl. زُعَمَآءُ.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also Described; syn. مَوْصُوفٌ. (Har<br>\
p. 204.)<br>\
زَعَامَةٌ: see زَعَمٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also High, or elevated, rank<br>\
or condition or state; or nobility. (K.) And<br>\
Chiefdom, lordship, mastery, or princedom:<br>\
(IAar, S, K:) [accord. to the Msb, an inf. n. in<br>\
this sense:] thus expl. by IAar as occurring in<br>\
the following verse of Lebeed: (TA:)<br>\
وَوِتْرًا وَالزَّعَامَةُ لِلْغُلَامِ  تَطِيرُ عَدَائِدُ الأَشْرَاكِ شَفْعًا<br>\
(S and TA in the present art. and in art. عد)<br>\
[The portions of inheritance of the sharers fly<br>\
away, two together and singly; but the chiefdom<br>\
is for the boy]: by his saying شَفْعًا وَوِتْرًا, he<br>\
means that the male&#39;s share of inheritance is like<br>\
that of two females [so that he has two portions<br>\
when the female has one]: but other explanations, those here following, are given of الزعامة<br>\
as used in this verse. (TA. [See also عَدِيدَةٌ.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  A weapon, or weapons; syn. سِلَاحٌ. (S, K.)<br>\
So, accord. to J, in the verse of Lebeed: for, he<br>\
says, they used, when they divided the inheritance, to give the weapon, or weapons, to the son,<br>\
exclusively of the daughter. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  A coat of<br>\
mail: (K:) or coats of mail: and thus it is<br>\
expl. by IAar as used in the verse of Lebeed.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  The chief&#39;s share of spoil. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
And The best and most of the property of an<br>\
inheritance and the like: (K:) and thus, also, it<br>\
has been expl. as used in the verse of Lebeed.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, and ↓ زَعَّامَةٌ, An animal of the<br>\
ox-kind; [probably meaning one of the wild<br>\
species;] syn. بَقَرَةٌ. (K.)<br>\
زَعَّامَةٌ: see the next preceding sentence.<br>\
مَزْعَمٌ A thing, or an affair, -in which no confidence is to be placed; (S, K;) this saying, or<br>\
asserting, it to be thus, and this saying, or asserting, it to be thus: (S:) [pl. مَزَاعِمُ.] One says,<br>\
فِى قَوْلِهِ مَزَاعِمُ (S, TA) i. e. [In his saying are<br>\
things in which no confidence is to be placed; or]<br>\
no confidence is to be placed in his saying. (TA.)<br>\
And هٰذَا أَمْرٌ فِيهِ مَزَاعِمُ This is an affair that is<br>\
not right; (TA;) [wherein are things] respecting<br>\
which there is dispute. (K, TA.) And زَعَمَ غَيْرَ<br>\
مَزْعَمٍ He said that which was not good, or right,<br>\
or just; and asserted what was impossible. (Msb.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A thing that is, or is to be, coveted, or<br>\
eagerly desired; syn. مَطْمَعٌ. (S, TA.) See two<br>\
exs. near the end of the first paragraph.<br>\
مُزْعَمٌ: see its fem., with ة, voce زَعُومٌ.<br>\
أَمْرٌ مُزْعِمٌ A thing, or an affair, that makes one<br>\
to covet, or desire eagerly. (TA.)<br>\
مَزْعُومٌ: see its fem., with ة, voce زَعُومٌ.<br>\
مِزْعَامَةٌ A serpent. (K.)<br>\
هُوَ مُزَاعَمٌ No confidence is to be placed in him,<br>\
or it. (So in the TA. [But I incline to think it<br>\
a mistranscription for فِيهِ مَزَاعِمُ. See مَزْعَمٌ.])<br>\
