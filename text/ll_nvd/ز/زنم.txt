↓ مُزَنَّمٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, and ↓ مُزَنَّمٌ, (tropical:)  One adopted<br>\
among a people to whom he does not belong, (Fr<br>\
in explanation of the former word as used in the<br>\

زَنَمَة among them: (S, TA:) and i. q. دَعِىٌّ [as<br>\
meaning likewise one who is adopted among a<br>\
people or by a person (though understood in some<br>\
other sense by F)]; (Mbr, Mgh, Msb, TA;)<br>\

former word, (tropical:)  Base, ignoble, or mean; known by<br>\
his baseness, ignobleness, or meanness, (S, K, TA,)<br>\
or his evil character, (K, TA,) like as the شَاة<br>\
[i. e. sheep or goat] is known by its زَنَمَة: (S, TA:<br>\
[in the latter of which is added, “because the<br>\
cutting of the ear is a mark: ” but by its زنمة is<br>\
here meant “ its wattle; ” for the cutting of the<br>\
ear of the camel is a mark of generous race:])<br>\
thus expl. by &#39;Ikrimeh as used in the Kur ubi<br>\
suprà. (S.) And (assumed tropical:)  The son of an adulteress or<br>\
a fornicatress. (TA.) ―<br>\

(TA.)<br>\
أَزْنَمُ, and its fem. (زَنْمَآءُ): see زَنِمٌ. ―<br>\

مَغَانِمُ شَتَّى مِنْ إِفَالِ مُزَنَّمِ<br>\
[Sundry spoils consisting of the young camels the<br>\
offspring of Muzennem]: (S:) thus A&#39;Obeyd<br>\
read, instead of إِفَالٍ مُزَنَّمِ, in which the latter<br>\
word is used for مُزَنَّمَةٍ, [by poetic license,] because<br>\
إِفَالٌ is of a measure common to masc. and fem.<br>\
words. (EM p. 120.)<br>\
