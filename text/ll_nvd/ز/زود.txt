زَادَ, aor. يَزُودُ, (L,) inf. n. زَوْدٌ, (L, K,) He<br>\
laid in a stock of provisions for travelling or for<br>\
a fixed residence; syn. أَسَّسَ زَادًا: (L, K:) or<br>\
زَادَهُ is syn. with زَوَّدَهُ; q. v.; and this is what is<br>\
meant in the K by تَأْسِيسُ الزَّادِ as the explanation<br>\
of الزَّوْدُ. (MF.)<br>\

زوّدهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. تَزْوِيدٌ; (KL;)<br>\
as also ↓ ازداهُ, (K,) inf. n. إِزْوَادٌ; (TA;) and<br>\
↓ زَادَهُ, inf. n. زَوْدٌ; (MF;) He furnished him<br>\
with, or gave him, provisions (S, Msb, K, * KL)<br>\
for travelling [or for a fixed residence]. (S,<br>\
Msb.) [It is doubly trans.:] you say, زَوَّدَهُمْ مِلْءَ<br>\
المَزَاوِدِ [He furnished them with what filled the<br>\
provision-bags for travelling-provision]: (A:)<br>\
and زوّدهُ الزَّيْتُ [He furnished him with olive-oil<br>\
for travelling-provision]. (S in art. زيت.) And<br>\
Aboo-Khirásh says,<br>\
وَقَدْ يَأْتِيكَ بِالأَخْبَارِ مَنْ لَا<br>\
↓ تُجَهِّزُ بِالحِذَآءِ وَلَا تُزِيدُ<br>\
[And sometimes, or often, he will bring thee<br>\
tidings whom thou wilt not furnish with the<br>\
sandal nor furnish with travelling-provisions].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] زَوَّدْتُهُ كِتَابًا (tropical:)  [I provided him<br>\
with a letter]. (A, TA.)<br>\

تزوّد [He became furnished, or he furnished<br>\
himself, with provisions for travelling or for a<br>\
fixed residence;] he took, or prepared, for himself provisions (S, * KL, TA) for travelling or for<br>\
a fixed residence: (TA: [Golius makes it to be<br>\
trans. by means of بِ as on the authority of the<br>\
KL; in which the only explanation, as that of<br>\
the inf. n., is توشه برگرفتن:]) and he chose a<br>\
thing as زَاد [or provision] for himself. (Har p.<br>\
92.) You say, تَزَوَّدَ مِنَّا فُلَانٌ [Such a one was<br>\
furnished, or such a one furnished himself, with<br>\
provisions from us]. (A.) And تزوّد لِسَفَرِهِ [He<br>\
was furnished, or he furnished himself, with<br>\
provisions for his journey]. (Msb.) And see<br>\
another ex. voce زَادٌ. You say also, تَزَوَّدَ مِنَ<br>\
الدُّنْيَا لِلْآخِرَةِ (tropical:)  [Take thou provisions from the<br>\
present world, i. e. make thou provision in it,<br>\
for the world to come]. (A, TA.) And تَزَوَّدَ<br>\
مِنَ الأَمِيرِ كِتَابًا لِعَامِلِهِ (tropical:)  [He provided himself<br>\
with a letter from the commander, or governor,<br>\
or prince, to his prefect]. (A, TA.) And تَزَوَّدَ<br>\
مِنِّى طَعْنَةً بَيْنَ أُذُنَيْهِ (tropical:)  [He got from me a stab,<br>\
or spear-wound, or the like, between his ears].<br>\
(A, TA.)<br>\
زَادٌ Provisions, or a stock of provisions, for<br>\
travelling (S, L, Msb, TA) and for a fixed residence: (L, TA:) pl. أَزْوَادٌ (L, Msb) and أَزْوِدَةٌ;<br>\
the latter anomalous. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, as<br>\
being likened thereto, (tropical:)  Any deed, or acquirement,<br>\
whether good or evil, whereby one becomes changed<br>\
in state, or condition; (L;) [or rather, whereby<br>\
one provides for a change of state, or condition,<br>\
like as a traveller provides for a journey.] It is<br>\
said in the Kur [ii. 193], فَإِنَّ خَيْرَ الزَّادِ ↓ وَتَزَوَّدُوا<br>\
التَّقْوَى (L) meaning, [as is implied in the L,<br>\
(tropical:)  And make ye provision; but verily the best<br>\
acquirement whereby to provide for a change of<br>\
state, or condition, is fear of God, or piety: or<br>\
the meaning is] and prepare ye provisions for<br>\
your journey; and verily the best provision is<br>\
that whereby one provides against begging from<br>\
others, &amp;c. (Jel.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [It is also said to be used<br>\
as meaning (assumed tropical:)  Salutation and the returning of a<br>\
greeting. (De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Ar., ii. 415, q. v.)]<br>\
مَزَادٌ: see مَزَادَةٌ.<br>\
مِزْوَدٌ A bag, or other receptacle, (S, * Msb, K,<br>\
TA,) for travelling-provisions, (S, K, TA,) or<br>\
for dates, made of leather: (Msb:) pl. مَزَاوِدُ.<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] رِقَابُ المَزَاوِدِ [lit.<br>\
The necks of provision-bags;] a nickname applied<br>\
to the عَجَم [or Persians, or foreigners in general,]<br>\
(S, K) by the Arabs. (S.) [See art. رقب.]<br>\
مَزَادَةٌ [A leathern water-bag, one of a pair<br>\
which is borne by a camel or other beast;;] the<br>\
half (شَطْر) of a رَاوِيَة: pl. مَزَائِدُ; [regularly مَزَاوِدُ;<br>\
or the medial radical is ى and therefore the reg. pl.<br>\
is مَزَايِدُ;] and sometimes they said ↓ مَزَادٌ, [a<br>\
coll. gen. n.,] without ة: [accord. to some,] it is<br>\
of the measure مَفْعَلَةٌ, [originally مَزْوَدَةٌ,] from<br>\
الزَّادُ, because one furnishes himself with water in<br>\
it for travelling-provision: (Msb:) [and therefore<br>\
it is mentioned in this art.:] but this is a mistake.<br>\
