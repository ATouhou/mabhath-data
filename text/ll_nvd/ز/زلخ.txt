or an extreme limit, to which one shoots with a<br>\
long four-feathered arrow rising in its flight so<br>\
as to exceed the usual limit; from three hundred<br>\
to four hundred cubits being said to be the limit,<br>\
or extreme limit, to which an arrow is shot; and<br>\
غَالْ being used by poetic license for غَالٍ]: (S:)<br>\
or, accord. to ADk, زلخ here signifies the furthest limit to which an arrow is shot by him who<br>\
endeavours to shoot it to the utmost distance: or,<br>\
accord. to Lth, the raising the hand, or arm, in<br>\
shooting an arrow to the furthest possible distance: so says Az; who adds that he had not<br>\
heard this last explanation on any other authority<br>\
than that of Lth, but hoped it might be correct.<br>\
(L, TA.) [See also زَلْجٌ.]<br>\
زَلِخٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\

زَلَخَانٌ and زَلْخَانٌ (assumed tropical:)  The advancing, or preceding, accord. to the K, in going, or gait, but<br>\
accord. to the parent-lexicons, in haste, or quickly;<br>\
as also زلجان [i. e. زَلَجَانٌ, which is an inf. n.;<br>\
and in like manner زَلَخَانٌ and زَلْخَانٌ, accord. to<br>\
the TK, are inf. ns., of which the verb is زَلَخَ,<br>\

مِنْهَا الصِّيبَانُ: in two other copies, يَتَزَلَّجُ: and in<br>\
one of these, عَلَيْهَا is put in the place of مِنْهَا.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also (tropical:)  A pain that attacks in the back, (A, K,)<br>\
which consequently becomes hard, or rigid, and<br>\
rough, (K,) depriving one of the power of motion<br>\
(A, K) by reason of its violence: (A:) and some<br>\
pronounce the word ↓ زُلَخَةٌ, without teshdeed to<br>\
the ل; and some, erroneously, with ج: (TA:)<br>\
or it is a disease that attacks in the back and the<br>\
side: (ISd, TA:) [and ↓ زُلَّخٌ appears to signify<br>\
the same, or to be a coll. gen. n.: for] AA cites<br>\
the following verse:<br>\
وَصِرْتُ مِنْ بَعْدِ القَوَامِ أَبْزَخَا<br>\
الدَّهْرُ بِظَهْرِى زُلَّخَا ↓ وَزَلَّخَ<br>\
[app. meaning, And I have become, after goodliness<br>\
of stature, or symmetry, or justness of proportion,<br>\

مُزَلَّخٌ, applied to a man, (tropical:)  Mean, ungenerous,<br>\
or sordid; [as though] repelled, and made to slip,<br>\
from generosity: ―<br>\
-b2-  and hence, applied to living,<br>\
or sustenance, or means of subsistence, and to a<br>\
gift, mean, paltry, scanty, or deficient. (A, TA.<br>\
[See also مُزَلَّجٌ.])<br>\
مِزْلَاخٌ [A kind of latch, or sliding bolt; also<br>\
called مِزْلَاجٌ, q. v., and مِزْلَاقٌ;] a thing with which<br>\
doors are made fast without its being [itself] made<br>\
fast [or locked]. (A, TA.)<br>\
