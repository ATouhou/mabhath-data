زَحَّهُ, (S, L, K,) aor.<br>\
زَحُ3َ, (S, L,) inf. n. زَحٌّ;<br>\
(L;) and ↓ زَحْزَحَهُ; (L;) He removed him, or<br>\
it, from his, or its, place: (S, L, K:) and he<br>\
pushed, or thrust, away, him, or it: (L, K:) or<br>\
the latter, he removed him, or it, far away;<br>\
placed, or put, him, or it, at a distance, far away,<br>\
or far off: (S, A, Mgh, L, Msb:) and the former<br>\
signifies also he drew, dragged, or pulled, away,<br>\
him, or it, in haste. (L, K.) You say, ↓ زَحْزَحَهُ<br>\
عَنْهُ He removed him, or it, far away; (S, K;)<br>\
or pushed, or thrust, away; and removed; him,<br>\
or it; (TA;) from it; (S, K;) i. e. from his, or<br>\
its, place. (TA.) It is said in the Kur [iii. 182],<br>\
عَنِ النَّارِ وَأُدْخِلَ الجَنَّةَ فَقَدْ فَازَ ↓ فَمَنْ زُحْزِحَ, i. e.<br>\
[And he] who shall be removed [from the fire<br>\
of Hell], or removed far away [therefrom, and<br>\
made to enter Paradise, shall attain good fortune]. (TA.)<br>\
R. Q. 1<br>\
زَحْزَحَ: see above, in three places:<br>\
-A2-<br>\
and see also the paragraph here following.<br>\
R. Q. 2<br>\
تَزَحْزَحَ He, or it, removed, or became<br>\
removed; (S, A, Mgh, Msb;) and (Mgh, Msb)<br>\
removed, or became removed, far away: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K:) and accord. to Es-Semeen, ↓ زَحْزَحَ is<br>\
likewise used in an intrans. sense, as well as a<br>\
trans.; but MF says that its use in an intrans.<br>\
sense is strange. (TA.) You say, دَخَلْتُ عَلَى<br>\
فُلَانٍ فَتَزَحْزَحَ لِى عَنْ مَجْلِسِهِ, i. e. [I went in to<br>\
such a one, and] he removed [for me from his<br>\
sitting-place]. (Mgh, Msb. *)<br>\
زَحْزَحٌ Distance: so in the saying, هُوَ بِزَحْزَحٍ مِنْهُ<br>\
[He, or it, is at a distance from him, or it].<br>\
(S, K.) Az says that, accord. to some, this is a<br>\
reduplicative word from زَاحَ, aor. يَزِيحُ, meaning<br>\
تَأَخَّرَ; and some hold it to be from الزَّوْحُ meaning<br>\
“ the driving vehemently,” as also الذَّوْحُ. (TA.)<br>\
زَحْزَاحٌ Distant; remote. (K.)<br>\
مُتَزَحْزَحٌ A place to which one removes, or may<br>\
remove, [in an absolute sense, as is implied in the<br>\
A, or] far away. (Ham p. 655.) One says, مَالِى<br>\
عَنْهُ مُتَزَحْزَحٌ [There is not for me any place to<br>\
which to remove from him, or it]. (A.)<br>\
