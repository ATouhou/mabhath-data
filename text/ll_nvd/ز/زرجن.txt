زَرْجَنَةٌ (as an inf. n. TK) i. q. تَخَارُجٌ<br>\
[q. v.]: (K) one says, زَرْجَنُوا, meaning تَخَارَجُوا.<br>\
(TK.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The being deceitful, wicked, dishonest, or dissimulating, and mischief-making; or<br>\
very deceitful &amp;c.: and the act of deceiving, deluding, beguiling, circumventing, or outwitting:<br>\
(K:) one says, زَرْجَنَهُ, meaning He deceived him,<br>\
deluded him, &amp;c. (TK.)<br>\
زَرَجُونٌ, (S, K,) which is also written زُرْجُونٌ,<br>\
like عُصْفُورٌ, is mentioned in art. زرج and also in<br>\
the present art. by the author of the K, though<br>\
he charges J with error in mentioning it in this<br>\
art. because مُزَرَّجٌ is used by a rájiz as meaning<br>\
“ intoxicated: ” whereas J is not in error, but is<br>\
right, in doing thus; for the ن is radical accord.<br>\
to the generality of the lexicologists and the<br>\
authors on inflection, like the س in قَرَبُوسٌ; and<br>\
the rájiz above referred to elided the ن in forming<br>\
مُزَرَّجٌ because he imagined it to be augmentative:<br>\
(MF in art. زرج:) it signifies Wine; (S, K;)<br>\
and is a Pers. word, (As, Sh, Seer, S,) originally<br>\
زركون, [i. e. زَرْگُونْ,] (Sh, TA,) meaning “ goldcoloured: ” (As, Sh, Seer, S:) or it signifies, (S,<br>\
Mgh,) or signifies also [like as does عِنَبٌ, of<br>\
which the primary signification is “ grapes ”],<br>\
(K,) the grape-vine; (ISh, S, Mgh, K;) n. un.<br>\
with ة; (ISh, TA;) and pl. زَرَاجِينُ: (Mgh:) it<br>\
has this meaning in the dial. of Et-Táïf: (ISh,<br>\
TA in art. زرج:) or the shoots of a grape-vine:<br>\
(Mgh, K:) thus in the dial. of Et-Táïf and ElGhowr: (TA in the present art.:) or a shoot that<br>\
is planted, of a grape-vine. (AHn, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also<br>\
A certain red dye. (El-Jarmee, S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
Water that remains or stagnates, or collects, or<br>\
remains long and becomes altered, or becomes<br>\
yellow and altered, in a rock: (K in art. زرج:)<br>\
or clear water that remains or stagnates, &amp;c., in<br>\
a mountain. (MF, TA.)<br>\
