زوّج شَيْئًا بِشَىْءٍ, and زوّجهُ إِلَيْهِ, [inf. n. تَزْوِيجٌ,]<br>\
He coupled, or paired, a thing with a thing;<br>\
united it to it as its fellow, or like. (TA.) So in<br>\
the Kur [xliv. 54 and lii. 20], زَوَّجْنَاهُمْ بِحُورٍ عِينٍ<br>\
We will couple them, or pair them, [with females<br>\
having eyes like those of gazelles:] (S, Mgh, K,<br>\
TA:) the meaning is not the تَزْوِيج commonly<br>\
known, [i. e. marriage,] for there will be no<br>\
[such] تزويج in Paradise. (MF, TA.) And so<br>\
in the Kur [lxxxi. 7], وَإِذَا النُّفُوسُ زُوِّجَتْ And<br>\
when the souls shall be coupled, or paired, or<br>\
united with their fellows: (TA:) i. e., with their<br>\
bodies: (Bd, Jel:) or, each with its register:<br>\
(Bd:) or with its works: (Bd, TA:) or the souls<br>\
of the believers with the حُور, and those of the<br>\
unbelievers with the devils: (Bd:) or when each<br>\
sect, or party, shall be united with those whom<br>\
it has followed. (TA.) And so in the phrase,<br>\
زَوَّجْتُ إِبِلِى I coupled, or paired, my camels, one<br>\
with another: (A:) or زَوَّجْتُ بَيْنَ الإِبِلِ I coupled,<br>\
or paired, every one of the camels with another.<br>\
(TA.) So too in the Kur [xlii. 49], أَوْ يُزَوِّجُهُمْ<br>\
ذُكْرَانًا وَإِنَاثًا Or He maketh them couples, or<br>\
pairs, males and females: or, accord. to AM,<br>\
maketh them of different sorts [or sexes], males<br>\
and females: for ―<br>\
-b2-  تَزْوِيجٌ signifies [also] The<br>\
making to be of different sorts or species [&amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  زَوَّجْتُهُ امْرَأَةً, (T, S, A, * Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
thus the Arabs say accord. to Yoo (S, Mgh) and<br>\
ISK, (Mgh,) making the verb doubly trans. by<br>\
itself, [without a particle,] meaning I married<br>\
him, or gave him in marriage, to a woman;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) as also بِامْرَأَةٍ; (A, K;) Akh says<br>\
that this is allowable [app. as being of the dial.<br>\
of Azd-Shanooäh (see 5)]: (Msb, TA:) [when<br>\
the verb is trans. by means of بِ, it generally<br>\
has the meaning expl. in the first sentence of this<br>\
art.:] زَوَّجْتُ مِنْهُ امْرَأَةً is not of the language of<br>\
the Arabs: (T, Mgh, TA:) [but see a similar<br>\
phrase in a verse cited in art. حصن, conj. 4:] the<br>\
lawyers say, زَوَّجْتُهُ مِنْهَا [meaning I married him<br>\
to her]; but this is a phrase for which there is no<br>\
reasonable way of accounting, unless that it is<br>\
accord. to the opinion of those who hold that مِنْ<br>\
may be redundant in an affirmative proposition, or<br>\
that of those who hold that it may be substituted<br>\
for بِ. (Msb.)<br>\
3<br>\
زاوجهُ, [inf. n. مُزَاوَجَةٌ and زِوَاجٌ] It, or he,<br>\
was, or became, a couple, or pair, with it, or<br>\
him: or made a coupling, or pairing, with it, or<br>\
him. (MA.) [And زَاوَجَا They two formed<br>\
together a couple, or pair.] ―<br>\
-b2-  [And زاوجا, inf. n.<br>\
as above, They married each other.] You say,<br>\
هُذَيْلٌ يُزَاوِجُ عِكْرِمَةَ [The tribe of Hudheyl intermarry with that of &#39;Ikrimeh]. (A. [See also 6.])<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  زاوج بَيْنَهُمَا and ↓ ازوج (tropical:)  [He made them two<br>\
(referring to sentences or phrases) to have a<br>\
mutual resemblance in their prose-rhymes, or in<br>\
measure: or to be connected, each with the other;<br>\
or dependent, each on the other]. (A, TA.) See<br>\
also 8, in three places.<br>\
4<br>\
أَزْوَجَ see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
5<br>\
تَزَوَّجْتُ امْرَأَةً, (T, S, A, * Mgh, Msb, K,)<br>\
thus the Arabs say accord. to Yoo (S, Mgh) and<br>\
ISK, (Mgh,) meaning I married a woman; i. e.,<br>\
took a woman in marriage; took her as my wife;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) as also بِامْرَأَةٍ; (A, * K;) or this is<br>\
rare; (K;) Akh says that it is allowable; (Msb,<br>\
TA;) and it is said to be of the dial. of AzdShanooäh, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) by Fr; (S, TA;)<br>\
but accord. to Yoo (S, Mgh) and ISK, (Mgh,)<br>\
it is not of the language of the Arabs. (T, S,<br>\
Mgh.) And تزوّج فِى بَنِى فُلَانٍ (A, Msb, TA)<br>\
He married, or took a wife, among the sons of<br>\
such a one. (Msb, TA.) And تزوّج إِلَيْهِ i. q. خَاتَنَهُ<br>\
[He allied himself to him by marriage]. (K in<br>\
art. ختن.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] تزوّجهُ النَّوْمُ (assumed tropical:)  Sleep pervaded him; syn. خَالَطَهُ. (K.)<br>\
6<br>\
تزاوج القَوْمُ and ↓ اِزْدَوَجُوا The people, or<br>\
party, married one another; intermarried. (TA.<br>\
[See also 3.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also the next paragraph, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
8<br>\
اِزْدَوَجَتِ الطَّيْرُ [The birds coupled, or paired,<br>\
one with another]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 6. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
اِزْدَوَجَا and ↓ تَزَاوَجَا [and ↓ زَاوَجَا], said of two<br>\
phrases, or sentences, (A, TA,) (tropical:)  They bore a<br>\
mutual resemblance in their prose-rhymes, or in<br>\
measure: or were connected, each with the other;<br>\
or dependent, each on the other: and in like<br>\
manner, ازدوج and ↓ تزاوج, said of a phrase, or<br>\
sentence, (tropical:)  It was such that one part of it resembled another in the prose-rhyme, or in the<br>\
measure: or consisted of two propositions connected, each with the other; or dependent, each on<br>\
the other: (TA:) اِزْدِوَاجٌ and ↓ مُزَاوَجَةٌ (S, A, K)<br>\
and ↓ تَزَاوُجٌ (S) are syn.: (S, A, * K:) ازدواج signifies A conformity, or mutual resemblance, [with<br>\
respect to sound, or measure,] of two words occurring near together; as in the phrase مِنْ سَبَأٍ بِنَبَأٍ<br>\
[in the Kur xxvii. 22]: (Kull p. 31:) and this<br>\
is also termed ↓ مُزَاوَجَةٌ and مُحَاذَاةٌ and مُوَازَنَةٌ<br>\
and مُقَابَلَةٌ and مُؤَازَاةٌ. (Marginal note in a copy<br>\
of the Muzhir, 22nd نوع.)<br>\
زَاجٌ [Vitriol;] a well-known kind of salt; (K,<br>\
TA;) called شَبٌّ يَمَانِىٌّ; [but see شَبٌّ;] which is<br>\
a medicinal substance, and one of the ingredients<br>\
of ink: (Lth, TA:) [pl. زَاجَاتٌ, meaning species,<br>\
or sorts, of vitriol; namely, green, or sulphate of<br>\
iron, which is an ingredient in ink, and is generally meant by the term زاج when unrestricted by<br>\
an epithet; blue, or sulphate of copper; and<br>\
white, or sulphate of zinc:] it is a Pers. word,<br>\
(S,) arabicized, (S, K,) originally زاگ. (TA.)<br>\
زَوْجٌ primarily signifies A sort of thing of any<br>\
kind [that is one of a pair or couple]: and زَوْجَانِ<br>\
signifies a pair, or couple, i. e. any two things<br>\
paired or coupled together, whether they be likes<br>\
or contraries: زَوْجٌ signifying either one of such<br>\
two things: (Az, TA:) or, accord. to &#39;Alee Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Eesà, a sort of thing [absolutely]: (Mgh:) or a<br>\
sort of thing having its like, (El-Ghooree, Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) as in the case of species; (Msb;) or having<br>\
its contrary, (El-Ghooree, Mgh, Msb,) as the<br>\
moist and the dry, and the male and the female,<br>\
and the night and the day, and the bitter and the<br>\
sweet; (Msb;) though sometimes applied to any<br>\
sort of thing; and to a single thing: (El-Ghooree,<br>\
Mgh:) or it is applied to a single thing only<br>\
when having with it a thing of the same kind;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb;) زَوْجَانِ signifying a pair, or couple,<br>\
of such things: (Mgh:) the pl. is أَزْوَاجِ: (TA:)<br>\
you say زَوْجَانِ مِنْ حَمَامٍ and زَوْجَا حَمَامٍ [A pair<br>\
of pigeons]: (A:) and اِشْتَرَيْتُ زَوْجَى حَمَامٍ [I<br>\
bought a pair of pigeons], meaning a male and a<br>\
female: (S:) and زَوْجَا نِعَالٍ [A pair of sandals]:<br>\
(S, A:) and in like manner زَوْجَيْنِ is used in the<br>\
Kur xi. 42 and xxiii. 28; (S;) meaning a male<br>\
and a female: (Bd, Jel:) or, accord. to the M,<br>\
زَوْجٌ signifies one of a pair or couple: and also<br>\
a pair or couple together: (TA:) and in like<br>\
manner says AO, (Mgh, Msb,) and IKt, and<br>\
IF: (Msb:) and ISh says that it signifies two;<br>\
(Mgh;) and so says IDrd: (Msb:) so that you<br>\
say, هُمَا زَوْجٌ as well as هُمَا زَوْجَانِ [meaning They<br>\
two are a pair, or couple]; (S, K, TA;) like as<br>\
you say, هُمَا سَوَآءٌ and هُمَا سِيَّانِ: (S, TA:) and<br>\
عِنْدِى زَوْجُ نِعَالٍ, meaning [I have] two [sandals]; and زَوْجَانِ, meaning four: (Msb:) or<br>\
زَوْجُ حَمَامٍ as meaning a male and a female [of<br>\
pigeons] is a phrase which should not be used;<br>\
one to which the vulgar are addicted: (TA:)<br>\
IAmb says, the vulgar are wrong in thinking<br>\
that زَوْجٌ signifies two; for the Arabs used not to<br>\
employ such a phrase as زَوْجُ حَمَامٍ, but used to<br>\
say زَوْجَانِ مِنَ الحَمَامِ, (Mgh, Msb, TA,) meaning<br>\
a male and a female; (TA;) and زَوْجَانِ مِنَ الخِفَافِ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, TA,) meaning the right and the<br>\
left [of boots]: (TA:) nor did they apply the<br>\
term زَوْجٌ to one of birds, like as they applied the<br>\
dual, زَوْجَانِ, to two; but they applied the term<br>\
فَرْدٌ to the male, and فَرْدَةٌ to the female: (Mgh,<br>\
Msb:) Es-Sijistánee, also, says that the term زَوْجٌ<br>\
should not be applied to two, neither of birds nor<br>\
of other things, for this is a usage of the ignorant;<br>\
but to every two, زَوْجَانِ: (Msb:) Az says that<br>\
the grammarians disapprove the saying of ISh<br>\
that زَوْجٌ signifies two of any things, (Mgh, *<br>\
TA,) and that زَوْجَانِ مِنْ خِفَافٍ signifies [Two<br>\
pairs of boots, or] four [boots]; for زَوْجٌ with<br>\
them signifies one [of a pair or couple]: a man<br>\
and his wife [together] are termed زَوْجَانِ: and<br>\
ثَمَانِيَةَ أَزْوَاجٍ in the Kur [vi. 144 and xxxix. 8]<br>\
means Eight ones [of pairs or couples]: the<br>\
primary meaning of زَوْجٌ being that first mentioned in this paragraph; (TA:) in the Kur<br>\
xxii. 5 and 1. 7 [it seems to be implied that it<br>\
means pair or couple; but more probably in these<br>\
instances] it means sort, or species: (Bd, Jel:)<br>\
it is also expl. by the word لَوْنٌ [used in this last<br>\
sense]: (T, TA;) in the Kur xxxviii. 58, its pl.<br>\
أَزْوَاجٌ means أَلْوَانٌ and أَنْوَاعٌ [i. e. sorts, or species]<br>\
of punishment: F explains the sing. as meaning<br>\
لَوْنٌ مِنَ الدِّيبَاجِ وَنَحْوِهِ [a sort, or species, of silk<br>\
brocade and the like]; but his restricting the<br>\
signification by the words من الديباج ونحوه is<br>\
not right, as is shown by a citation, in the T, of<br>\
a verse of El-Aashà, in which he uses the phrase<br>\
كُلُّ زَوْجٍ مِنَ الدِّيبَاجِ [every sort, or species, of<br>\
silk brocade], as an ex. of زوج in the sense of<br>\
لون. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] A woman&#39;s husband:<br>\
and a man&#39;s wife: in which latter sense ↓ زَوْجَةٌ<br>\
is also used; (S, M, A, Mgh, * Msb, K; *) as in a<br>\
verse of El-Farezdak cited in art بول, conj. 10;<br>\
(S, Mgh;) but it is disallowed by As; (TA;)<br>\
and the former word is the one of high authority,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) and is that which occurs in the<br>\
Kur, in ii. 33 and vii. 18, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,)<br>\
and in iv. 24, (Mgh, TA,) and in xxxiii. 37:<br>\
(Mgh:) AHát says that the people of Nejd call a<br>\
wife ↓ زَوْجَةٌ, and that the people of the Haram<br>\
use this word: but ISk says that the people of<br>\
El-Hijáz call a wife زَوْجٌ; and the rest of the<br>\
Arabs, ↓ زَوْجَةٌ: the lawyers use this latter word<br>\
only, as applied to a wife, for the sake of perspicuity, fearing to confound the male with the<br>\
female: (Msb:) the pl. of زَوْجٌ is أَزْوَاجٌ (Msb,<br>\
K *) and زِوَجَةٌ; (K;) and the pl. of ↓ زَوْجَةٌ is<br>\
زَوْجَاتٌ (A, Mgh, Msb) and أَزْوَاجٌ also; (A,<br>\
Msb;) and أَزَاوِيجُ occurs [as a pl. pl., i. e. pl. of<br>\
أَزْوَاجُ,] in a verse cited by ISk. (TA in art. نأج.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] A consociate, an associate, or a<br>\
comrade: (A:) its pl. in this sense is أَزْوَاجٌ, (S,<br>\
A, K,) occurring in the Kur xxxvii. 22. (S, A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And A fellow, or like: pl. أَزْوَاجٌ: in this<br>\
sense, each one of a pair of boots is the زوج of<br>\
the other; and the husband is the زوج of the<br>\
wife; and the wife, the زوج of the husband.<br>\
(TA.) You say, عِنْدِى مِنْ هٰذَا أَزْوَاجٌ I have, of<br>\
this, fellows, or likes. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  As used by<br>\
arithmeticians, (Mgh, Msb,) contr. of فَرْدٌ; (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) i. e. it signifies An even number;<br>\
a number that may be divided into two equal<br>\
numbers; (Msb;) as, for instance, four, and<br>\
eight, as opposed to three, and seven: (Mgh:) pl.<br>\
أَزْوَاجٌ. (S, Mgh.) One says زَوْجٌ أَوْ فَرْدٌ [Even<br>\
or odd?], like as one says خَسًا أَوْ زَكًا [or rather<br>\
زَكًا أَوْ خَسًا] and شَفْعٌ أَوْ وِتْرٌ. (S, Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b6-  Also<br>\
A [kind of cloth such as is termed] نَمَط [q. v.]:<br>\
or silk brocade; syn. دِيبَاجٌ: (TA:) or a نَمَط<br>\
that is thrown over the [kind of vehicle called]<br>\
هَوْدَج. (S, K, TA.)<br>\
زِيجٌ: see art. زيج.<br>\
زَوْجَةٌ: see زَوْجٌ, in four places, in the latter<br>\
half of the paragraph.<br>\
زَوْجِيَّةٌ and ↓ زَوَاجٌ [The marriage-state, or<br>\
simply marriage]: the latter is a subst. from<br>\
زَوَّجَ, [i. e. a quasi-inf. n.,] like سَلَامٌ from سَلَّمَ,<br>\
and كَلَامٌ from كَلَّمَ. (Msb.) You say, بَيْنَهُمَا<br>\
حَقُّ الزَّوْجِيَّةِ and ↓ الزَّوَاجِ [Between them two is<br>\
the right of the marriage-state, or of marriage]:<br>\
(A, Msb:) and الزِّوَاجِ is also allowable as [an<br>\
inf. n. of 3,] coordinate to المُزَاوَجَة. (Msb.)<br>\
زَوَاجٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in two<br>\
places.<br>\
زَائِجَةٌ: see art زيج.<br>\
مِزْوَاجٌ A woman who marries often: (S, K:)<br>\
one who has had many husbands. (K.)<br>\
