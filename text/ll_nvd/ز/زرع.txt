زَرَعَ, aor.<br>\
زَرَعَ, (K,) inf. n. زَرْعٌ (S, TA) and<br>\
زِرَاعَةٌ, (TA,) He sowed, or cast seed; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ اِزْدَرَعَ, (S, Msb, K,) originally اِزْتَرَعَ, the<br>\
ت being changed into د in order that it may<br>\
agree with the ز, (S, K,) for د and ز are pronounced with the voice as well as the breath,<br>\
whereas ت is pronounced with the breath only:<br>\
(S, TA:) [or the latter verb, as appears from an<br>\
explanation of it to be found below, may signify<br>\
he sowed for himself.] They say, مَنْ زَرَعَ حَصَدَ<br>\
[He who sows reaps]. (TA.) And [they use<br>\
this verb transitively, saying,] زَرَعْتُ البُرَّ وَالشَّعِيرَ<br>\
[I sowed wheat and barley]: and in like manner,<br>\
زَرَعْتُ الشَّجَرَ [I sowed the trees; or sowed the seeds<br>\
which should produce the trees: or it may signify<br>\
I planted the trees]. (Ibn-Abi-l-Hadeed.) And<br>\
زَرَعَ الحُبَّ لَكَ فِى القُلُوبِ كَرَمُكَ وَحُسْنُ خُلُقِكَ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Thy generosity and the goodness of thy disposition have sown love for thee in the hearts].<br>\
(TA.) And it is said in a trad., مَنْ كَانَتْ لَهُ أَرْضٌ<br>\
فَلِيَزْرَعْهَا أَوْ لِيَمْنَحْهَا أَخَاهُ فَإِنْ أَبَى فَلِيُمْسِكْ أَرْضَهُ<br>\
[Whoso hath land,] let him sow it [or let him lend<br>\
it, or give it, to his brother; and if he refuse, let<br>\
him retain his land]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  زَرَعَ الأَرْضَ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb,) inf. n. زَرْعٌ, (Msb,) signifies [also]<br>\
(tropical:)  He ploughed up, or tilled, or cultivated, the<br>\
land, or ground, for sowing. (Mgh, Msb.)<br>\
Hence [the saying in a trad.], إِذَا زَرَعَتْ هٰذِهِ الأُمَّةُ<br>\
نُزِعَ مِنْهَا النَّصْرُ (tropical:)  When this nation shall employ<br>\
itself altogether with agriculture and the affairs<br>\
of the present world, and turn away from warring<br>\
against unbelievers and the like, aid shall be withdrawn from it. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  زَرَعَهُ اللّٰهُ signifies<br>\
God caused it, or made it, to grow, vegetate, or<br>\
germinate; (S, Mgh, Msb, K;) and, to increase;<br>\
(Mgh;) namely, الحَرْثَ [the seed-produce]. (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) The verb is properly thus used of divine<br>\
affairs, exclusively of human: (Er-Rághib:) and<br>\
hence the saying in the Kur [lvi. 63-4], أَفَرَأَيْتُمْ مَا<br>\
تَحْرُثُونَ أَأَنْتُمْ تَزْرَعُونَهُ أَمْ نَحْنُ الزَّارِعُونَ (S, * Er-Rághib) Now think ye, what ye sow, do ye cause<br>\
it to grow, or are We the causers of growth?<br>\
(Bd:) or, as some say, do ye cause it to increase,<br>\
or are We the causers of its increase? the حَرْث<br>\
[or sowing] being ascribed to them, and the زَرْع<br>\
[or causing to grow] exclusively to God: when<br>\
the latter is ascribed to a man, it is because he<br>\
is an agent as a means of making to grow; as<br>\
when you say, أَنْبَتُّ كَذَا (assumed tropical:)  I was a means of<br>\
causing such a thing to grow. (Er-Rághib.) [In<br>\
like manner,] you say, زَرْعًا ↓ اِزْدَرَعَ, meaning<br>\
(tropical:)  [He raised seed-produce, i. e., was a means of<br>\
causing it to grow,] for himself, in particular.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,] one says, with respect to a<br>\
child, زَرَعَهُ اللّٰهُ (tropical:)  May God render him sound and<br>\
strong; syn. جَبَرَهُ: (S, K, TA:) like as one says<br>\
أَنْبَتَهُ اللّٰهُ: and in like manner, زَرَعَ اللّٰهُ وَلَدَكَ لِلْخَيْرِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [May God render thine offspring sound and<br>\
strong, or rather, cause thine offspring to grow<br>\
up, for the doing, or enjoyment, of what is good].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [Hence also,] زُرِعَ لَهُ بَعْدُ شَقَاوَةٍ (tropical:)  [An<br>\
increase was made for him after adversity; or]<br>\
he obtained property after want; for the verb in<br>\
this instance is like عُنِىَ. (Ibn-&#39;Abbád, K.)<br>\
3<br>\
مُزَارَعَةٌ is of the measure مُفَاعَلَةٌ, [denoting a<br>\
mutual action,] from الزِّرَاعَةُ, (Mgh,) and its signification is well known; (S;) i. e. (tropical:)  The making<br>\
a contract, or bargain, with another, for labour<br>\
upon land, [to till and sow and cultivate it, as is<br>\
indicated in the Mgh and Msb,] for a share, or<br>\
portion, of its produce, (Msb, K, TA,) the seed<br>\
being from the owner of the land. (K, TA.)<br>\
[You say, زَارَعَهُ (tropical:)  He made with him a contract,<br>\
or bargain, such as is above described; and in like<br>\
manner, خَابَرَهُ, and آكَرَهُ. The doing this is forbidden, because of the uncertainty of the result.]<br>\
4<br>\
ازرع It (a plant, or herbage,) had, or became<br>\
in the state of having, زَرْع [i. e. produce of its<br>\
seed; i. e. it grew from its seed]: (TA:) and,<br>\
said of زَرْع [or seed-produce], it became tall:<br>\
(K:) or, as some say, it produced its leaves: and<br>\
it attained to the proper time for its being reaped.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ازرع النَّاسُ signifies أَمْكَنَهُمُ الزَّرْعُ [expl.<br>\
in the TK as meaning The men, or people, became<br>\
able to sow seed; i. e., became possessors of seed:<br>\
but I rather think that it means they had seedproduce within their power, or reach; they became able to avail themselves thereof; or they<br>\
attained to a season when they had seed produce]. (K.)<br>\
5<br>\
تزرّع إِلَى الشَّرَّ i. q. تسرّع [He hastened, or<br>\
made haste, to do evil, or mischief]. (Sgh, K.)<br>\

piety, and I beg of Him means of subsistence for<br>\

TA,) used as a subst. properly so termed, signitying Seed-produce; what is raised by means of<br>\
sowing; (Mgh, Msb;) what is sown; (K, TA;)<br>\
while in growth, [i. e. standing corn, and the<br>\
like,] (K and TA voce أَزْرَعَ,) and also after it has<br>\
been reaped; (S and Msb and K in art. رفع, &amp;c.;)<br>\
its predominant application is to wheat and barley;<br>\
(TA;) but it signifies also plants, or herbage, [in<br>\
general,] such as one reaps; or, as some say, only<br>\
while fresh and juicy: (Msb:) [and often a sown<br>\
field:] pl. زُرُوعٌ. (S, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,]<br>\
(tropical:)  Offspring, or children; or a child. (IDrd, K,<br>\
TA.) You say, هٰؤُلَآءِ زَرْعُ فُلَانٍ (tropical:)  These are the<br>\

harvest, of the conduct of the sinner]. (TA.)<br>\
