زَبَدَهُ, (As, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
زَبُدَ, (As,<br>\
S, A, Msb,) inf. n. زَبْدٌ, (As, Msb,) He fed him<br>\
with, or gave him to eat, زُبْد [i. e. fresh butter].<br>\
(As, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, (Mgh,)<br>\
زَبَدَهُ, (As, S, A, Mgh, Msb,) or زَبَدَ لَهُ, (K, [app.<br>\
a mistranscription, for its aor. is there mentioned<br>\
immediately after without the prep.,]) aor.<br>\
زَبِدَ,<br>\
(As, S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) the verb in the sense<br>\
here following being thus distinguished from that<br>\
in the sense preceding, (As, Msb,) inf. n. as above,<br>\
(As, S, Mgh,) (tropical:)  He gave him a gift: (As, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb:) or he gave him somewhat, a little,<br>\
not much, (S, K,) of property, (S,) or of his<br>\
property. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence also,] زَبَدْتُهُ ضَرْبَةً, or<br>\
رَمْيَةً, (tropical:)  I struck him a blow, or shot or cast at him<br>\
a missile, hastily, or quickly; as though feeding<br>\
him with a piece of fresh butter. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
زَبَدَتْ سِقَآءَهَا, (S, A,) or زَبَدَ السِّقَآءَ, (K,) inf. n. as<br>\
above, (A,) She agitated her milk-skin, (S, A,)<br>\
or he agitated the milk-skin, (K,) in order that<br>\
its butter might come forth, (S, K,) or until its<br>\
butter came forth. (A.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And زَبَدْتُ السَّوِيقَ<br>\
[app. I put, or added, fresh butter to the meal<br>\
of parched barley, like as one says سَمَنْتُ الطَّعَامَ<br>\
and أَدَمْتُ الخُبْزَ &amp;c.], aor. أَزْبِدُهُ, (A, TA,) with<br>\
kesr; (A;) and السَّوِيقَ ↓ تَزَبَّدْتُ. (TA. [Both<br>\
these phrases are mentioned together, as though<br>\
to indicate that both signify the same: but Ibr D<br>\
thinks that the latter means I swallowed the سويق<br>\
like as one swallows fresh butter: in my copy of<br>\
the A, it is written تَزَبَّدَتِ السَّوِيقُ, which is evidently wrong: perhaps the right reading is تَزَبَّدَ<br>\
السَّوِيقُ; and the verb in this phrase, quasi-pass.<br>\
of that in the former phrase.]<br>\
2<br>\
زبّد شِدْقُهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَزْبِيدٌ; (K;) and<br>\
↓ تزبّد; both signify the same [i. e. The side of his<br>\
mouth had froth, or foam, appearing upon it;<br>\
like زَبَّبَ and تَزَبَّبَ]: (S, K:) and ↓ تزبّد said of<br>\
a man, [like تَزَبَّبَ,] He being angry, froth, or<br>\
foam, appeared upon each corner of his mouth.<br>\
(TA.) See also 4, in two places.<br>\
-A2-  زَبَّدَتِ القُطْنَ,<br>\
(A, L,) inf. n. as above, (S,) She separated, or<br>\
loosened, the cotton [with her fingers, or by means<br>\
of the bow and wooden mallet], (S, * L, A,) and<br>\
prepared it well for spinning. (L.)<br>\
3<br>\
فُلَانٌ يُزَابِدُ فُلَانًا (tropical:)  Such a one speaks in like<br>\
manner as does such a one. (A, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
ازبد, (S, A, Msb, K,) inf. n. إِزْبَادٌ, (Msb,)<br>\
said of wine, or beverage, (S,) or of the sea, (A,<br>\
Msb, K,) &amp;c., (Msb,) or of the sea when in a<br>\
state of commotion, (S, * A,) and of a cookingpot, and of the mouth of a braying camel, (A,)<br>\
[&amp;c., see زَبَدٌ,] It frothed, or foamed, or cast<br>\
forth froth or foam: (S, * A, Msb, K:) and [in<br>\
like manner] ↓ زبّد, inf. n. تَزْبِيدٌ, said of milk, it<br>\
[frothed, or foamed; or] had froth, or foam,<br>\
upon it. (A.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] said of the سِدْر [or<br>\
lote-tree], (S, A, K,) (tropical:)  It blossomed; (S, K, TA;)<br>\
i. e. (TA) it put forth a white produce like the<br>\
froth, or foam, upon water. (A, TA.) And,<br>\
said of the قَتَادِ [or tragacantha], (assumed tropical:)  It put forth<br>\
its leaf (خُوصَة), and its wood, or branch, became<br>\
strong, or hard, and its rind, or outer covering,<br>\
coalesced, and it blossomed; as also ↓ زبّد. (L.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  Also (tropical:)  It became intensely white. (A, TA.)<br>\

تَزَبَّدَ see 1: ―<br>\
-b2-  and see also 2, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
تزبّدهُ (assumed tropical:)  He swallowed it (K) like as one swallows<br>\
a piece of fresh butter: (TA:) or he took the<br>\
clear, or pure, or choice, part of it. (K, TA.)<br>\
Of anything of which the clear, or pure, or choice<br>\
part has been taken, one says, تُزُبِّدَ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
[Hence,] تزبّد اليَمِينَ (assumed tropical:)  He took the oath hastily;<br>\
was hasty in taking it. (AA, S, K.) It is said<br>\
in a prov., تَزَبَّدَهَا حَذَّآءَ (assumed tropical:)  He swallowed it [i. e.<br>\
took it, namely, an oath, hastily,] like as one<br>\
swallows butter. (TA in art. حذ.)<br>\
زَبْدٌ [originally an inf. n.,] (tropical:)  A gift. (S, A,<br>\
Mgh, Msb.) So in the saying (S, TA) of Mo-<br>\
hammad, (TA,) mentioned in a trad., إِنَّا لَا نَقْبَلُ<br>\
زَبْدَ المُشْرِكِينَ (tropical:)  [Verily we will not accept the<br>\
gift of the believers in a plurality of Gods]. (S,<br>\
TA.) And so in the saying, نَهَى عَنْ زَبْدِ المُشْرِكِينَ<br>\
(tropical:)  (A, Mgh, Msb) i. e. [He (Mohammad) forbade]<br>\
the acceptance of the gift [of the believers in a<br>\
plurality of Gods]. (Msb.)<br>\
زُبْدٌ [Fresh butter of the cow or buffalo or sheep<br>\
or goat;] what is produced by churning from<br>\
milk (Mgh, Msb) of cows [or buffaloes] and of<br>\
sheep or goats; what is thus produced from camels&#39;<br>\
milk being termed جُبَابٌ, not زُبْدٌ; (Msb;) the<br>\
زُبْد of سَمْن before it is clarified over the fire;<br>\
(L;) [i. e. butter before it is clarified over the<br>\
fire;] the زُبْد [in the CK, erroneously, زَبَد] of<br>\
milk; (S, K;) what is extracted from milk;<br>\
(M;) and ↓ زُبَّادٌ signifies the same as زُبْدٌ: (K:)<br>\
↓ زُبْدَةٌ is a more particular term, (S, M, L, Msb,)<br>\
meaning a piece, bit, portion, or somewhat, of<br>\
زُبْد: (L:) and زُبْدُ اللَّبَنِ signifies also the froth<br>\
(رَغْوَة) of milk [if this be not a mistake occasioned<br>\
by finding الزُّبْدُ expl. as meaning زَبَدُ اللَّبَنِ instead of زُبْدُ اللَّبَنِ]. (L.) قَدْ صَرَّحَ المَحْضُ عَنِ<br>\
الزُّبْدِ [The clear milk has become distinct from<br>\
the fresh butter] is a prov., relating to the appearance of the truth after information that has<br>\
been doubted. (L.) And ↓ اِرْتَجَنَتِ الزُّبْدَةُ is<br>\
another prov. [expl. in art. رجن]. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ↓ زُبْدَةٌ<br>\
has for its pl. زُبَدٌ, which is metonymically applied<br>\
to (tropical:)  The choice, or best, portions, [or what we<br>\
often term the cream (by which word the sing.<br>\
also may be rendered) of anything; as, for instance,] of discourse, or of a story or the like.<br>\
(Har p. 222, q. v.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [And it also means (assumed tropical:)  An<br>\
issue, or event: (see an ex. voce مَخَضَ:) generally, such as is relishable, or pleasing. Hence,<br>\
app.,] one says, العُمُرِ ↓ كَانَ لِقَاؤُكَ زُبْدَةَ (tropical:)  [The<br>\
meeting with thee was emphatically the event of<br>\
life; meaning, the most relishable, or pleasing,<br>\
event of life]. (A, TA.)<br>\
زَبَدٌ Froth, foam, spume, or scum: (L:) it is<br>\
of water, (S, L, K,) &amp;c.; (K;) of the sea, (A,<br>\
Msb,) &amp;c., like رَغْوَةٌ [in signification]; (Msb;)<br>\
and of a cooking-pot; (A;) and of a camel, (S,)<br>\
[i. e.] of a braying camel&#39;s mouth, (A,) or the<br>\
white foam upon the lips of a camel when he is<br>\
excited by lust; (TA;) and of the cud; and of<br>\
spittle; (L;) and [the scum, or dross,] of silver:<br>\
(S:) ↓ زَبَدَةٌ is a more particular term [meaning a<br>\
portion, or somewhat, thereof]: (S:) the pl. of<br>\
زَبَدٌ is أَزْبَادٌ. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  تَخَرَّمَ زَبَدُهُ: see 5 in<br>\
art. خرم, in two places.<br>\
زُبْدَةٌ: see زُبْدٌ, in four places.<br>\
زَبَدَةٌ: see زَبَدٌ.<br>\
زُبْدِىٌّ [Butyraceous: a rel. n. from زُبْدٌ]. See<br>\
خَشْخَاشٌ.<br>\
زَبَادٌ [Civet;] a certain perfume, well known:<br>\
the lawyers and the lexicologists err in saying<br>\
that it is a certain beast, [meaning the civet-cat,]<br>\
from which the perfume is milked: (K:) or this<br>\
assertion is not to be reckoned as a mistake, the<br>\
word being tropically thus applied: so says El-<br>\
Karáfee: and Z and other authors worthy of confidence thus apply it [as a coll. gen. n.]: Z also<br>\
mentions a saying in which ↓ زَبَادَةٌ is applied [as a<br>\
n. un.] to an animal of the kind from which the<br>\
perfume is obtained: (TA:) this animal is the<br>\
cat, (K,) i. e. the wild cat, which is like the tame,<br>\
but longer and larger, and its hair inclines more<br>\
to blackness: it is brought from India and Abyssinia: (TA:) the perfume above mentioned is a<br>\
fluid, or matter, exuded, (رَشَحٌ, thus in the TA<br>\
and in my MS. copy of the K, but in the CK<br>\
وَسَخٌ [i. e. dirt],) resembling black viscous dirt,<br>\
(TA,) which collects beneath the animal&#39;s tail,<br>\
upon the anus (المَخْرَج), (K,) and in the inner<br>\
sides of the thighs also, as says Ed-Demámeenee:<br>\
(TA:) [see also زُهْمٌ:] the beast is taken, and<br>\
prevented from struggling, and the said exuded<br>\
fluid or matter, or dirt, (رَشَح, or وَسَخ, accord. to<br>\
different copies of the K,) collected there, is<br>\
scraped off with a piece of the exterior part of a<br>\
cane, (K,) or, more commonly, with a spoon,<br>\
(TA,) or with a piece of rag, (K,) or a thin<br>\
[silver coin such as is called] دِرْهَم. (TA. [Other<br>\
accounts of this perfume, which are less correct,<br>\
I omit.])<br>\
-A2-  See also زُبَّادٌ.<br>\
زُبَادٌ, like غُرَابٌ [in measure], Fresh butter<br>\
(زُبْد) that has become bad, or spoiled, in the<br>\
churning: or, as some say, thin milk. (TA voce<br>\
اِخْتَلَطَ, q. v.) [See also زُبَّادُ اللَّبَن, below.]<br>\
زَبَادَةٌ: see زَبَادٌ.<br>\
زُبَّادُ اللَّبَنِ [The watery part of milk;] that<br>\
[part] in which is no good, of milk. (S, K. [See<br>\
also زُبَادٌ.]) It is said in a prov., اِخْتَلَطَ الخَاثِرُ<br>\
بِالزُّبَّادِ (S) [The thick milk became mixed with the<br>\
thin watery part: or] (tropical:)  the good became mixed<br>\
with the bad: relating to a case of difficulty, and<br>\
applied to the mixture of truth with falsehood.<br>\
(L. [See Freytag&#39;s Arab. Prov., i. 434: and see<br>\
اِخْتَلَطَ.]) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also زُبْدٌ.<br>\
-A2-  زُبَّادٌ and ↓ زُبَّادَى A<br>\
certain plant, (S, K,) growing in the plains, or<br>\
soft land, having broad leaves, and a [pericarp<br>\
such as is called] سِنْفَة: it sometimes grows in<br>\
hard ground, is eaten by men, and is good, or<br>\
pleasant: AHn says that it has small, contracted,<br>\
dust-coloured leaves, like those of the مَرْزَنْجُوش,<br>\
and its branches, or twigs, spread out: and he<br>\
adds, AZ says that the زُبَّاد, as also ↓ زَبَاد, the<br>\
latter like سَحَاب [in measure], is of the [kind of<br>\
plants called] أَحْرَار [pl. of حُرٌّ, q. v.]: (TA:)<br>\
[some say that it is the psyllium. (Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Lex.) See, again, اِخْتَلَطَ.]<br>\
زُبَّادَى: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
زَابِدٌ Possessing, or a possessor of, زُبْد [or<br>\
fresh butter]; (L;) as also ↓ مُزْدَبِدٌ. (K.)<br>\
بَحْرٌ مُزْبِدٌ [A frothing, or foaming, sea; or] a<br>\
tumultuous, frothing, or foaming, sea. (S, A.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] أَبْيَضُ مُزْبِدٌ (tropical:)  Intensely white. (A,<br>\
