زَنڤ3َ see 4, in five places.<br>\
-A2-  زَنَّ عَصَبُهُ, [aor.,<br>\
accord. to rule,<br>\
زَنِ3َ, or the sec. pers. may be زَنِنْتَ,<br>\
and the aor.<br>\
زَنَ3َ, and the inf. n., in this case, رَنَنٌ,<br>\
which see below, but the TK makes its aor. to<br>\
be<br>\
زَنُ3َ, and the inf. n. زَنٌّ,] His sinews dried up.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  زَنَّ فَذَنَّ means حقن فقطر [which may<br>\
be rendered He kept in, or retained, his urine,<br>\
and then dribbled it, or his urine was kept in, or<br>\
retained, and then dribbled]. (TA. [See زِنِّينٌ.])<br>\
4<br>\
أَزْنَنْتُهُ I thought him to possess good or evil;<br>\
as also ↓ زَنَنْتُهُ, aor.<br>\
زَنُ3َ, inf. n. زَنٌّ: or both mean I<br>\
imputed, or attributed, to him good or evil:<br>\
(Msb:) or فُلَانًا بِخَيْرٍ ↓ زَنَّ or بِشَرٍّ he thought such<br>\
a one to possess good or evil; like أَزَنَّهُ; syn. ظَنَّهُ بِهِ:<br>\
(K:) or, accord. to Lh, one says, أَزْنَنْتُهُ بِمَالٍ and<br>\
بِخَيْرٍ I thought him to possess [property and (as<br>\
appears from what is said below on his authority)<br>\
wealth]: but ↓ زَنَنْتُهُ is what the vulgar say, and is<br>\
wrong. (TA.) And أَزْنَنْتُهُ بِشَىْءٍ, (S,) or بِكَذَا,<br>\
(K,) and also بكذا ↓ زَنَنْتُهُ, (Har p. 112,) [and<br>\
accord. to Golius ↓ اِزْتَنَنْتُهُ, mentioned by him as<br>\
from the S, but not found therein by Freytag,<br>\
nor by me in either of my copies,] I suspected<br>\
him of a thing, or of such a thing: (S, K, and<br>\
Har ubi suprà:) [but] Lh says, لَا يَكُونُ الإِزْنَانُ<br>\
فِى الخَيْرِ [app. meaning that أَزَنَّ is not said in<br>\
relation to that which is good: see what is cited<br>\
on his authority above]. (TA.) And ازنّهُ بِالأَمْرِ<br>\
He suspected him of the thing, or affair; like<br>\
أَظَنَّهُ. (S.) And هُوَ يُزَنُّ بِكَذَا [He is suspected of<br>\
such a thing]. (S.) Hassán says,<br>\
حَصَانٌ رَزَانٌ مَا تُزَنُّ بِرِيبَةٍ<br>\
i. e. [Chaste, staid,] she is not suspected of evil:<br>\
[in which تُزَنُّ may be from ↓ زُنَّتْ or from أُزِنَّتْ:]<br>\
but some restrict themselves to the quadriliteral<br>\
verb [ازنّ]. (Msb.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِزْتَنَ3َ see 4.<br>\
زَنَّةٌ A suspicion: whence the saying, ↓ أَبُو زَنَّةٍ<br>\
شَرٌّ مِنْهُ أَخُو زَنَّةٍ The ape, or baboon, or monkey,<br>\
(القِرْدُ,) worse than he is the person who has conceived a suspicion: (A, TA:) [for] ―<br>\
-b2-  أَبُو زَنَّةٍ, (so<br>\
in three copies of the S and in my MS. copy of<br>\
the K,) or ↓ ابو زِنَّةٍ, (thus in the CK and TK and<br>\
JM, [in the second and third of which it is expressly said to be “ with kesr,” which, however,<br>\
the author of the K should have added, accord. to<br>\
his usual practice, if he meant it to be thus,])<br>\
signifies القِرْدُ. (S, K.)<br>\
أَبُو زِنَّةٍ: see what next precedes, in two places.<br>\
مَآءٌ زَنَنٌ, and مِيَاهٌ زَنَنٌ, [which suggests that زَنَنٌ<br>\
is an inf. n. used as an epithet,] A water, and<br>\
waters, small in quantity, and narrow: (K:)<br>\
[for] زَنَنٌ signifies strait, or narrow; like زَنَآءٌ and<br>\
زَنِىٌّ [which do not belong to this art.]: (TA:) or<br>\
مَآءٌ زَنَنٌ means [a place of water] of which one<br>\
knows not whether there be in it water or<br>\
not. (K.)<br>\
ظِلٌّ زَنَانٌ Short [or contracted] shade; like زَنَآءٌ<br>\
[mentioned in art. زنأ]. (K.)<br>\
زُنَانَى A fluid like mucus, that falls from the<br>\
noses of camels: (K:) but the more approved<br>\
word is ذُنَانَى. (TA.)<br>\
زَنَانِىٌّ A man who suffices for himself, without<br>\
any other. (K.)<br>\
زَنَّانٌ One who opines, or conjectures, much;<br>\
i. q. ظَنَّانٌ. (TA.)<br>\
زِنِّينٌ One suppressing his urine and his ordure:<br>\
occurring in a trad.: or, as some say, it is زِبِّينٌ,<br>\
[q. v.,] with ب. (TA. [But see 1, and see also<br>\
what here follows.])<br>\
أَزَنُّ One suppressing his urine [or his ordure];<br>\
syn. حَاقِنٌ: such is one of the persons forbidden,<br>\
in a trad., to act as إِمَام to others. (TA in art.<br>\
نصر: mentioned also, but not expl., in the present<br>\
art. in the TA.) [See also the next preceding<br>\
paragraph.]<br>\
