زفّت He smeared a receptacle [such as a<br>\
wine-skin and a wine-jar] with زِفْت. (Msb.)<br>\
زِفْتٌ [Pitch: or tar: or a sort of pitch: or<br>\
crude pitch:] i. q. قَارٌ: (A, Mgh, K:) or قِيرٌ:<br>\
(Msb:) or قَطِرَانٌ: (A, Msb:) or it is like قِيرٌ:<br>\
(S:) it is not the قِير with which ships are smeared,<br>\
but [like this inasmuch as] it is also a black substance, with which wine-skins are seasoned; for<br>\
the قير of ships dries upon them, whereas the زفت<br>\
of skins does not dry: (TA:) or [crude pitch;<br>\
i. e.] a produce of the pine, or pitch-tree; which<br>\
is of two sorts, moist and dry; the latter being<br>\
either cooked, or congealed of itself; such as<br>\
flows of itself from the trees is called زفت; such<br>\
as is prepared by cooking, and art, قَطِرَانٌ. (TK.)<br>\
[See also كُفْرٌ: and see De Sacy&#39;s “ Abd-allatif,”<br>\
p. 273.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, (K, * TA,) i. e. زِفْتٌ, (TA,)<br>\
[not مُزَفَّتٌ, which Freytag has supposed to be<br>\
here intended in the K, and not without some<br>\
reason, for the passage is ambiguous,] A certain<br>\
medicine; (K, TA;) a thing that comes forth<br>\
from the earth, [app. a sort of bitumen, perhaps<br>\
another name for قَفْرٌ يَهُودِىٌّ bitumen Judaicum,<br>\
or Jew&#39;s pitch,] that is an ingredient in medicines:<br>\
not the زفت commonly known. (TA.)<br>\
مُزَفَّتٌ Smeared with زِفْت; (S, A, * Mgh, K;)<br>\
applied to a wine-skin, (A,) or a vessel, or receptacle for wine; i. q. مُقَيَّرٌ. (TA.) The receptacle<br>\
thus termed quickly occasions alteration [or fermentation] in the wine [contained in it]. (Mgh.)<br>\
You say جَرَّةٌ مُزَفَّتَةٌ A jar smeared with زِفْت.<br>\
(S.) And it is said in a trad., نَهَى عَنِ المُزَفَّتِ<br>\
[He forbade the use of that skin, or vessel, which<br>\
is smeared with زفت, for the beverage called<br>\
نَبِيذ]. (TA.)<br>\
