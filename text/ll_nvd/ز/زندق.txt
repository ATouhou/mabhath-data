religion; (KL;) [a disbeliever in the world to<br>\
come and in the Deity, or the unity of the Creator: (see زَنْدَقَةٌ:) and an asserter of the endlessness of time: see زِنْدِيقٌ.]<br>\
زَنْدَقٌ, (Th, O, L, K, [in some of the copies of<br>\
the K, and in my copy of the Msb, زِنْدِيقٌ,<br>\
which, as is said in the TA, is a mistake,]) and<br>\
↓ زَنْدَقِىٌّ, A man very niggardly or avaricious.<br>\
(Th, O, L, K, Msb.)<br>\
زَنْدَقَةٌ a subst from the verb above mentioned;<br>\
(S, K;) [The adoption, or belief, or profession, of<br>\
the tenets of the زِنْدِيق: generally, deviation from<br>\
the right religion, or the impugning of religious,<br>\
and the state of him who is without religion;]<br>\
disbelief in the world to come and in [the Deity,<br>\
or] the unity of the Creator: (T, Mgh, Msb:)<br>\
[and the assertion of the endlessness of time: see<br>\
زِنْدِيقٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Also i. q. ضِيقٌ [as meaning Niggardliness, or avarice: see زَنْدَقٌ]. (L, TA.)<br>\
زَنْدَقِىٌّ: see زَنْدَقٌ.<br>\
زُنْدُوقٌ a dial. var. of صُنْدُوقٌ [q. v.]; (K;) like<br>\
as قَزْدٌ is of قَصْدٌ. (TA.)<br>\
زِنْدِيقٌ One who is of the ثَنَوِيَّة [or asserters of<br>\
the doctrine of Dualism]: (S, O, K:) or one who<br>\
asserts his belief in [the two principles of] Light<br>\
and Darkness: or one who does not believe in the<br>\
world to come, nor in the Deity: (O, K:) or one<br>\
who does not believe in the world to come nor in<br>\
the unity of the Creator: (T, Msb:) or one who<br>\
conceals unbelief and makes an outward show of<br>\
belief: (K:) an arabicized word, (S, Msb,) originally Pers., so they say, (Msb,) from الزَّنْدُ, which<br>\
is a book belonging to them [i. e. the book of<br>\
Zoroaster]: (PS:) [or from the Pers. زَنْدِيك,<br>\
meaning magian, or fire-worshipper: and this<br>\
seems to be its primary meaning; as De Sacy<br>\
says in his “ Chrest. Ar.,” 2nd ed., ii. 274:] or,<br>\
accord. to IDrd, it is an arabicized word from the<br>\
Persian زِنْدَه, (Mgh, [thus in my copy, app. for<br>\
زَنْدَهْ, in which the ه may be, as it is in many<br>\
other instances, an affix denoting some kind of<br>\
relationship,]) or زَنْدَ كِرْ, (TA, as from the L,<br>\
[but not very clearly written, and with an erasure,<br>\
such as to suggest that the original and right<br>\
reading may be زَنْدْ گِيرْ, which may be rendered<br>\
holder of the Zend, but]) which is expl. as meaning he [who] asserts his belief in the eternity, or<br>\
the endlessness, of the present world: (Mgh, TA:)<br>\
or it is arabicized from زَنْ دِين i. e. woman&#39;s<br>\
religion: (O, K:) or the right explanation is<br>\
this: that it is a term of relation to the زَنْد, which<br>\
is the book of Mánee the Magian, who was in<br>\
the time of Bahrám the son of Hurmuz the son of<br>\
Sáboor [or Shápoor], and who claimed to be<br>\
successor to the Messiah, on whom be peace;<br>\
and, desiring fame, composed this book, which<br>\
he hid in a tree, and then took forth: الزَّنْدُ, in<br>\
their language, is “ explanation; ” and he meant<br>\
that this was the explanation of the book of Zará-<br>\
dusht [or Zoroaster] the Persian; and in it he<br>\
held that there are two gods, Light and Darkness,<br>\
Light creating good, and Darkness creating evil:<br>\
(TA:) or, accord. to the “ Mefáteeh el-&#39;Uloom,”<br>\
زِنْدِيقٌ means a follower of Mánee, and also a<br>\
follower of Mezdek, who (i. e. Mezdek) appeared in the days of Kubádh, and asserted that<br>\
possessions and women were in common, and put<br>\
forth a book which he called زند, which is the<br>\
book of the Magians, that was brought by Zará-<br>\
dusht, whom they assert to have been a prophet:<br>\
and the companions of Mezdek were named in<br>\
relation to [this] زند; which word, being arabicized, was converted into زِنْدِيقٌ: (Mgh:) Th says<br>\
that زِنْدِيقٌ is not of the [genuine] language of the<br>\
Arabs; (Mgh, TA;) and when the Arabs desire<br>\
to express the meaning in which it is commonly<br>\
used, (Mgh, * Msb, TA,) which is one who does<br>\
not hold any religion, and who asserts his belief<br>\
in the endlessness of time, (Msb,) they say مُلْحِدٌ,<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, TA,) i. e. [a deviater from the right<br>\
religion, or] an impugner of religions, (Msb,)<br>\
and دَهْرِىٌّ: (Mgh, TA:) some say that it is from<br>\
الزَّنْدَقَةُ; because the زنديق straitens himself: (L,<br>\
TA:) an Arab of the desert is related to have explained it as meaning one who looks much into<br>\
things, or affairs: (Msb:) the pl. is زَنَادِقَةٌ and<br>\
زَنَادِيقُ; (S, O, Msb, K;) the latter being the<br>\
original pl., and the ة of the former being a<br>\
substitute for the suppressed ى of the latter.<br>\
