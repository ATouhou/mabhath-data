تَزْيِيفٌ is said to signify primarily The separating, or setting apart, such [money] as is passable, or current, from such as is termed زَائِف:<br>\
and hence, the rejecting [money], or returning<br>\

made, (MA, K,) or pronounced, (K,) or showed,<br>\

-A2-  Also The<br>\
إِفْرِيز, i. e., (Kr, TA,) the طَنَف, (Kr, O, K, TA,)<br>\

cresting of a wall, or of the crown of a cornice]:<br>\
n. un. with ة. (Kr, O, K.)<br>\
زَيَّافٌ, and with ة: see the next paragraph, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
زَائِفٌ One who walks in the manner described<br>\
in the first sentence of this art.; as also ↓ زَيْفٌ,<br>\
which is an inf. n. used as an epithet: (TA:)<br>\
[and so ↓ زَيَّافٌ, but properly in an intensive<br>\
sense:] and ↓ زَيَّافَةٌ a she-camel proud and self-<br>\
conceited [in her gait]. (S.) Hence, (TA,)<br>\
الزَّائِفُ signifies The lion; as also ↓ الزَّيَّافُ; (O,<br>\
K;) but the latter has an intensive meaning:<br>\
(TA:) so called because of his proud and selfconceited walk. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, and ↓ زَيْفٌ,<br>\
(S, Kr, Mgh, O, Msb, K,) the latter an inf. n.<br>\
used as an epithet, (Msb,) or, accord. to IDrd,<br>\
this is a vulgar term, (O,) or bad, (K,) applied<br>\
to a dirhem, or piece of money, (S, Mgh, O, Msb,<br>\
K,) to gold and to silver, (Har p. 369, referring<br>\
to the latter word,) Bad: (Kr, Msb, and Har<br>\
ubi suprà:) or such as are rejected, or returned,<br>\
because of adulterating alloy therein: (Mgh, O,<br>\
K:) or, as some say, such as are less bad than<br>\
what are termed بَهْرَج, being such as are rejected<br>\
by [the officers of] the government-treasury;<br>\
whereas the بهرج are such as are rejected by the<br>\
merchants, or traders: (Mgh:) the pl. is زِيَافٌ<br>\
and أَزْيَافٌ, (O, K,) [the latter a pl. of pauc.,] or<br>\
the pl. of ↓ زَيْفٌ is زُيُوفٌ, and the pl. of زَائِفٌ is<br>\
زُيَّفٌ: (Mgh, * Msb:) accord. to some, the زُيُوف<br>\
are such as are done over with a compound of<br>\
quicksilver and sulphur. (Msb.) [It is implied<br>\
in the Msb that ↓ زَيْفٌ is the more common term,<br>\
though, as has been stated above, it is said by<br>\
IDrd to be vulgar: and it is also applied to<br>\
human beings: for ex.,] a poet says,<br>\
تَرَى القَوْمَ أَشْبَاهًا إِذَا نَزَلُوامَعًا<br>\
وَفِى القَوْمِ زَيْفٌ مِثْلُ زَيْفِ الدَّرَاهِمِ<br>\
[Thou seest the people to be likes when they alight<br>\
together; but among the people are bad like the<br>\
bad of dirhems.] (TA.)<br>\
