should not say صِينِىٌّ. (S.)<br>\
زُؤَانٌ (S, M, Msb, K) and زُوَانٌ (M, Msb) and<br>\
زِئَانٌ (M, K) and زِوَانٌ (M, Msb) and زَآنٌ (K)<br>\
and زَوَانٌ, (K in art. زون, q. v.,) but the like of<br>\
سَحَابٌ is said by ISd to be a form not seen by<br>\
him on the authority of anyone, (TA,) [A noxious<br>\
weed, that grows among wheat; app. darnel-grass; the lolium temulentum of Linn.; so in the<br>\
present day;] a certain grain, (Msb,) the bitter<br>\
grain, (M,) that mingles with wheat, (S, M, Msb,<br>\
K,) and gives a bad quality to it: (Msb:) [the<br>\
grain thus called is often, accidentally, or carelessly,<br>\
mixed with wheat, and causes giddiness: the plant<br>\
resembles that now called شَيْلَم, a decoction of which<br>\
is used as an anæsthetic: it is said in the K in<br>\
art. شلم that the زؤان is the same as the شَيْلَم:<br>\
but it is said in the TA in that art., on the authority of AHn, that the grain of the شَيْلَم does not<br>\
intoxicate, (as that of darnel-grass is well known<br>\
to do in a certain manner,) and that it is very<br>\
bitter: and in the K in art. دنق it is said that the<br>\
دَنْقَة is the زُوَان, and the دَنَقَة is the شَيْلَم: the<br>\
TA states more fully in that art. that the دَنْقَة is<br>\
said by AHn to be the زُوَان that is in wheat,<br>\
which is cleared therefrom; and that the دَنَقَة is<br>\
said by AA to be the شَيْلَم: Forskål mentions the<br>\
زِوَان and the شَيْلَم, as different species, among<br>\
undetermined plants, and describes the former<br>\
thus: zizania Aleppensibus notissima: inter triticum viget: si semina restant farinæ [sic] mixta,<br>\
hominem reddunt ex panis esu temulentum: messores plantam non separant; sed post triturationem<br>\
vanni aut cribri ope semina rejiciunt: (Flora<br>\
Aegypt. Arab. p. 199:)] the n. un. is with ة.<br>\

أَزْأَنِىٌّ: see what next follows.<br>\
يَزْأَنِىٌّ and ↓ أَزْأَنِىٌّ, applied as epithets to a spear,<br>\
are dial. vars. of يَزَنِىٌّ (K, TA) and أَزَنِىٌّ: (TA:)<br>\
spears being thus called in relation to ذُو يَزَنٍ, one<br>\
of the Kings of Himyer: (S in art. يزن:) as also<br>\
آزَنِىٌّ and أَيْزَنِىٌّ, both formed by transposition.<br>\
