the mine in which it receives its being is in the<br>\
mine of the زمرّذ, with which it is found; but it is<br>\
very rare, more so than the زمرّذ: at the present<br>\
period, the year 640 [of the Flight], none whatever of it is found in the mine: some species of it<br>\
are of a dark green colour; some, light green;<br>\
and some, of a middling hue of green, of a good<br>\
water, and very transparent, and these are the<br>\
best and the most costly species thereof. (ElTeyfáshee, in De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Arabe, 2nd ed.,<br>\
