(K:) or, as some say, of the measure فَعْيَل; but<br>\
this is a weak assertion, for it is said that there<br>\
is no Arabic word of this measure; مَرْيَمُ being a<br>\
foreign proper name, and ضَهْيَأ being disputed.<br>\
(MF, TA.) [In some of its senses it is an epithet, and used as such: in some, app. an epithet<br>\
in which the quality of a subst. is predominant:<br>\
and in some, a simple subst.: but in all its senses<br>\
it is imperfectly decl.; and therefore seems to be<br>\
originally an epithet.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Brisk, lively, sprightly,<br>\
agile, or quick. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A man who walks with<br>\
short steps: (TA:) and short in stature and in<br>\
step; (K, TA;) likewise applied to a man.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Ignoble, base, or base-born. (K.) The<br>\
offspring of fornication or adultery; or the offspring of fornication, begotten on a slave. (Abu-l-Mekárim, TA.) One whose origin, or lineage,<br>\
is suspected; or an adopted son; or one who<br>\
claims as his father a person who is not his<br>\
father; or who is claimed as a son by a person<br>\
who is not his father; syn. دَعِىٌّ. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
A devil: (K:) accord. to some, a dial. var. of<br>\
أَزَبُّ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-  The hedge-hog. (IAar, K.) ―<br>\
-b7-<br>\
A disagreeable, a disapproved, or an abominable,<br>\
thing or affair. (K.) ―<br>\

wind; i. e.] the [wind termed] نَكْبَآء [q. v.] that blows<br>\
between the صَبَا and the جَنُوب: (S, M, K:) or<br>\
the south wind, or a southerly wind; syn. جَنُوبٌ;<br>\
(M, K;) of the dial. of Hudheyl; so affirm Mbr<br>\
in his “ Kámil ” and IF and Et-Tarábulusee:<br>\
IAth says that the people of Mekkeh use this<br>\
appellation much; and it is related to be God&#39;s<br>\
name for what men call the جنوب: Sh says that<br>\
the people of El-Yemen, and those who voyage<br>\
upon the sea between Juddah and &#39;Adan, cali<br>\
the جنوب by the name of الأَزْيَبُ, and know not<br>\
any other name for it; and that is because it is<br>\
boisterous, and stirs up the sea, turning it upsidedown: [whence it seems to mean the boisterous,<br>\
or violent:] ISh says that ذَاتُ أَزْيَبَ signifies<br>\
any violent wind. (L,TA.) ―<br>\
-b11-  [Hence it appears<br>\
that it signifies also Violence.] ―<br>\
-b12-  Also Enmity.<br>\
(S, K.) ―<br>\
-b13-  And Briskness, liveliness, sprightliness, agility, or quickness: (ISk, S, K, TA:)<br>\
[see also أَذْيَبُ:] it is fem.: one says, مَرَّ فُلَانٌ<br>\
وَلَهُ أَزْيَبُ مُنْكَرَةٌ [Such a one passed having a disapproved briskness, &amp;c.]: this is said when one<br>\
passes quickly by reason of briskness, &amp;c. (ISk,<br>\
S.) ―<br>\
