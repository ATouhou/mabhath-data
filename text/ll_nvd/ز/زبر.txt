زَبَرَ البِئْرَ, (A, TA,) [aor.<br>\
زَبُرَ, and perhaps<br>\
زَبِرَ<br>\
also,] inf. n. زَبْرٌ, (S, K,) He cased the well, or<br>\
walled it internally, with stones. (S, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
زَبْرٌ also signifies The disposing a building, or<br>\
construction, one part upon another; (K;) [as is<br>\
done in casing a well;] and in this sense likewise<br>\
it is an inf. n., of which the verb is زَبَرَ. (TK.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And زَبَرَهُ بِالحِجَارَةِ, (TA,) inf. n. زَبْرٌ, (K,) He<br>\
threw stones at him; or pelted him with stones.<br>\
(K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And [hence, perhaps, or] from زَبَرَ<br>\
in the first of the senses expl. above, because him<br>\
whom you restrain from error you strengthen like<br>\
as a well is strengthened by its being cased, (TA,)<br>\
زَبَرَهُ, (S, A, Mgh, Msb, K,) aor.<br>\
زَبُرَ (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K) and<br>\
زَبِرَ, (Ks, K,) inf. n. as above, (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) He chid him; or checked, restrained,<br>\
or forbade, him with rough speech: (S, A, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K:) he prevented, hindered, or withheld,<br>\
him: (S, Mgh, K:) he forbade, or prohibited,<br>\
him: (K:) he repelled him with strength. (MF<br>\
in art. هزبر.) You say, زَبَرَهُ عَنِ الأَمْرِ He restrained him with rough speech, or forbade and<br>\
prevented him, from doing the thing. (TA.)<br>\
And زَبَرَ السَّائِلَ He chid and repelled the beggar<br>\
with rough speech. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  زَبَرَ, (S, A, Msb, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
زَبُرَ and<br>\
زَبِرَ, (S, K,) inf. n. as above, He wrote<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K) a writing, or book: (A, Msb:)<br>\
or he wrote it firmly, skilfully, or well: (TA:)<br>\
and he inscribed, or engraved, upon stones: (Az,<br>\
TA:) and ↓ تَزْبِرَةٌ, also, is syn. with كِتَابَةٌ, like<br>\
زَبْرٌ, (S, K,) and خَطٌّ: As says, I heard an Arab<br>\
of the desert say, أَنَا أَعْرِفُ تَزْبِرَتِى, meaning<br>\
خَطِّى and كِتَابَتِى [i. e. I know my writing, or<br>\
handwriting]: (S:) and Fr says, It is either an<br>\
inf. n. of ↓ زَبَّرَ, meaning he wrote, though I know<br>\
not the verb with teshdeed, or it is a simple subst.<br>\
like تَوْدِيَةٌ: (TA:) thus زَبَرَ is syn. with ذَبَرَ:<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, T and S in art. ذبر:) [and so, perhaps,<br>\
is ↓ زَبَّرَ with ذَبَّرَ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And زَبَرْتُهُ signifies also I<br>\
read it, or recited it; [or did so with a low, or<br>\
faint, voice;] like ذَبَرْتُهُ [q. v.]. (As, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
زَبْرٌ is also syn. with كَلَامٌ [as meaning The act of<br>\
speaking, or speech as a subst.]: (K:) [SM says,]<br>\
thus it is found in all the copies: but [he adds] I have<br>\
not found any authoritative ex. of it, so it requires<br>\
consideration. (TA.) [Accord. to the TK, however, one says, سَأَلْتُهُ فَمَا زَبَرَ لِى بِزَبْرٍ, meaning I<br>\
asked him, and he spoke not to me a speech, or<br>\
sentence]<br>\
-A3-  Accord. to the K, زَبْرٌ is also syn.<br>\
with صَبْرٌ [meaning The being patient, or patience]:<br>\
one says, مَا لَهُ زَبْرٌ وَلَاصَبْرٌ: ISd says, This is mentioned by IAar; but in my opinion, the meaning<br>\
here is عَقْلٌ. (TA. [See زَبْرٌ below.]) [Or, as<br>\
syn. with صَبْرٌ, it may be an inf. n.: for, accord. to<br>\
the TK, one says, لم يزبر عليه, meaning He did<br>\
not endure it with patience (لَمْ يَصْبِرْ).]<br>\
-A4-  زَبُرَ,<br>\
inf. n. زَبَارَةٌ, He (a ram) was, or became, bulky.<br>\
(Lth, TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
زَبَّرَ see 1, in two places.<br>\
4<br>\
ازبر He (a man, TA) was, or became, large<br>\
in body. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He was, or became,<br>\
courageous, brave, or strong-hearted. (K.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
أَزْبَرْتُهُ, inf. n. إِزْبَارٌ, I rendered him (a ram) bulky.<br>\
(Lth, TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تزبّر He (a man) quaked, or trembled, by<br>\
reason of anger. (TA. [See also Q. Q. 4.])<br>\
Q. Q. 1<br>\
زَأْبَرَ (S, A, K) and زَوْبَرَ (K) [and app.<br>\
زَيْبَرَ (see مُزَأْبِرٌ)], said of a garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth, (S, A, K,) Its زِئْبِر [or nap] came forth;<br>\
(S, K; *) it had زِئْبِر. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also the first,<br>\
[and app. the second and third likewise,] He<br>\
made a garment, or piece of cloth, to have its زِئْبِر<br>\
[or nap] come forth. (K.) [This verb and<br>\
other similar words with hemzeh next after the ز<br>\
are mentioned in the K in a separate art. before<br>\
art. زبر.]<br>\
Q. Q. 4<br>\
اِزْبَأَرَّ It (fur, or soft hair, and a plant,<br>\
or herbage) grew forth. (S, K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  It (hair)<br>\
bristled up. (S, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He (a dog [and a<br>\
horse]) bristled up his hair. (S, K.) Marrár<br>\
Ibn-Munkid El-Handhalee says, (S, TA,) describing a horse, (TA,)<br>\
فَهْوَ وَرْدُ اللَّوْنِ فِى ازْبِئْرَارِهِ<br>\
وَكُمَيْتُ اللَّوْنِ مَا لَمْ يَزْبَئِرْ<br>\
[And he is of a yellowish red colour on the occasion of his bristling up his hair, and of a dark<br>\
bay colour as long as he does not bristle up his<br>\
hair]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also He (a cat) had abundance of hair. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And He (a man) prepared for evil, or mischief: (K, TA:) or became<br>\
affected by a quaking, or trembling, and a bristling-up of the hair. (TA)<br>\
زَبْرٌ Stones. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [The stone casing of the<br>\
interior of a well: see جُولٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence,]<br>\
(tropical:)  Understanding, intellect, or intelligence, (S, A,<br>\
K,) and judgment, (TA,) and self-restraint: (S,<br>\
A:) originally an inf. n. [accord. to some; but<br>\
this is evidently a mistake, as is shown by phrases<br>\
in which it is coupled with جُولٌ]. (S.) One<br>\
says, مَا لَهُ زَبْرٌ (tropical:)  He has not understanding, or intellect, or intelligence, nor self-restraint: (S, A:)<br>\
or judgment: or understanding to be relied upon.<br>\
(TA.) And لَهُ زَبْرٌ وَجُولٌ: and مَا فَوْقَ ↓ هُوَ مَزْبُورٌ<br>\
الجُولِ مِنْهُ وَصُلْبٌ مَا تَحْتَ الزَّبْرِ مِنَ الجُولِ: see<br>\
جُولٌ. One says also of the wind, when it veers,<br>\
or shifts, and does not continue to blow from one<br>\
point, لَيْسَ لَهَا زَبْرٌ (tropical:)  [It has not steadiness]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also زِبِرٌّ.<br>\
زِبْرٌ [A thing] written; as also ↓ زَبِيرٌ: (K:)<br>\
[or] a writing, or book; (S;) as also ↓ زَبُورٌ, of<br>\
the measure فَعُولٌ in the sense of the measure<br>\
مَفْعُولٌ, (S, Msb, K,) like رَسُولٌ: (Msb, TA:)<br>\
زَبُورٌ signifying any writing or book: or any<br>\
divine book with which it is difficult to become<br>\
acquainted: or a book that is confined to intel-lectual science, exclusive of legal statutes or ordinances: (TA:) ↓ الزَّبُورُ signifies particularly the<br>\
Book [of the Psalms] of David: (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K:) and also, and لُغَةُ الزَّبُورِ, the Syriac [or<br>\
Hebrew] language: (Mgh:) the pl. of زِبْرٌ is زُبُورٌ;<br>\
(S, K;) and the pl. of ↓ زَبُورٌ is زُبُرٌ. (S, Msb, K.)<br>\
It is said in the Kur [xxi. 105], وَلَقَدْ كَتَبْنَا فِى<br>\
مِنْ بَعْدِ الذِّكْرِ ↓ الزَّبُورِ, meaning And we have<br>\
written in the book sent down to David, after<br>\
the تَوْرَاة [or Book of the Law revealed to Moses]:<br>\
(Aboo-Hureyreh, TA:) Sa&#39;eed Ibn-Jubeyr read<br>\
الزُّبُور, [pl. of الزِّبْرُ,] and said that it means the<br>\
Book of the Law revealed to Moses (التوراة) and<br>\
the Gospel and the Kur-án [together]; and that<br>\
الذكر means what is in heaven: (TA:) and<br>\
some also read زُبُورًا in the Kur iv. 161 and<br>\
xvii. 57. (S, TA.)<br>\
زَبَرٌ, syn. with زَوْبَرٌ &amp;c.: see زِئْبِرٌ.<br>\
زُبْرَةٌ A piece of iron: (S, Msb, K:) or a big<br>\
piece of iron: (TA:) pl. زُبَرٌ (S, Msb, K) and زُبُرٌ.<br>\
(S, K.) The former pl. occurs in the Kur xviii.<br>\
95. (S.) It is also said in the Kur [xxiii. 55],<br>\
فَتَقَطَّعُوا أَمْرَهُمْ بَيْنَهُمْ زُبُرًا, (S, TA,) and زُبَرًا;<br>\
(TA;) meaning قِطَعًا, (S, TA,) in both cases;<br>\
(Fr;) [i.e., But they have become divided, in<br>\
their state, among themselves, into parties:] or<br>\
he who reads زُبُرًا makes it pl. of ↓ زَبُورٌ, not of<br>\
زُبْرَةٌ; for the measure فُعْلَةٌ does not assume the<br>\
measure فُعُلٌ in the pl.; and the meaning is, they<br>\
have made their religion [to be founded upon]<br>\
various books: and زُبَرٌ is pl. of زُبْرَةٌ: or it may be<br>\
also pl. of ↓ زَبُورٌ, and originally زُبُرٌ, being changed<br>\
therefrom, like as some of the Arabs are related to<br>\
have said جُدَدٌ for the pl. of جَدِيدٌ, which is<br>\
originally and regularly جُدُدٌ; after the same<br>\
manner as when one says رُكَبَاتٌ for رُكُبَاتٌ, and<br>\
غُرَفَاتٌ for غُرُفَاتٌ: and this opinion is strengthened<br>\
by AA&#39;s allowing the reading زُبُرًا and زُبْرًا and<br>\
زُبَرًا; زُبْرًا being a contraction of زُبُرًا, like as عُنْقٌ is<br>\
of عُنُقٌ. (IB, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The anvil (K) of a blacksmith. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  The upper part of the back,<br>\
next the neck; or the part between the two<br>\
shoulder-blades; or the part where the neck is<br>\
joined to the back-bone; syn. كَاهِلٌ: (K:) or<br>\
the place of the كاهل: (S:) or a certain thing<br>\
rising from the كاهل: (TA:) pl. in this sense,<br>\
أَزْبَارٌ; or this is a pl. pl., as though it were pl.<br>\
of زُبَرٌ, and this were pl. of زُبْرَةٌ in this sense.<br>\
(TA.) One says, شَدَّ لِلْأَمْرِ زُبْرَتَهُ He strengthened<br>\
his كَاهِل and his back for the affair. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also, hence, (S,) The accumulation, or mass, of<br>\
hair which is between the shoulder-blades of the<br>\
lion; (S in art. لبد;) [the mane of a lion;] the<br>\
collection of hair (Lth, A, K) between the shoulderblades of the lion &amp;c., (K,) or upon the place of<br>\
the كَاهِل [expl. above], and upon the elbows, of<br>\
the lion; (Lth, A;) and any hair in a similar<br>\
collected state. (Lth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,] الزُّبْرَةُ<br>\
(tropical:)  A certain asterism; (K;) two bright stars [d<br>\
and q], (S, K,) in the كَاهِل [or part of the back<br>\
next the neck], (K,) or which are the كَاهِلَانِ,<br>\
(S,) of Leo; (S, K;) one [namely the Eleventh]<br>\
of the Mansions of the Moon: (S, K:) [also<br>\
called الخَرَاتَانِ: see this word: and see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ,<br>\
in art. نزل:] it is of the dial. of El-Yemen. (TA.)<br>\
[This description is incorrect if applied to the<br>\
constellation as at present figured; but doubtless<br>\
correct when applied to it as figured by the Arabs.<br>\
Kzw, in his description of Leo, says that they are<br>\
two stars, on the belly, and on the projecting part<br>\
of the haunch-bone, of Leo.] ―<br>\
-b4-  Also The breast,<br>\
or what projects of its upper part, (syn. صُدْرَةٌ,)<br>\
of any beast. (TA.)<br>\
زِبِرٌّ, applied to a lion, (S, TA,) and to a man,<br>\
(TA,) Strong; (AA, S, K, TA;) as also ↓ زَبْرٌ.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
زَبُورٌ: see زِبْرٌ, in four places; and see زُبْرَةٌ, in<br>\
two places.<br>\
زَبِيرٌ: see زِبْرٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Applied to a ram, Bulky:<br>\
(Lth, TA:) or large in the زُبْرَة [q. v.]: or compact. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to a man, Strong: and<br>\
also acute, sharp, or quick, in intellect; clever,<br>\
ingenious, skilful, knowing, or intelligent. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also A calamity, or misfortune; (Fr, K;)<br>\
and so ↓, زَوْبَرٌ, (Mohammad Ibn-Habeeb, TA,)<br>\
which has been said to have this meaning in a<br>\
verse of Ibn-Ahmar cited below voce زِئْبِرٌ. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  And Black mud; or black fetid mud. (Sgh,<br>\
K.)<br>\
زَأْبَرٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
زُؤْبُرٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
زِئْبِرٌ (S, and K in art. زأبر, in the CK [erroneously] written زِئْبَر,) and زِئْبُرٌ, (S, K,) sometimes<br>\
thus pronounced, (S,) or this, which is mentioned<br>\
by IJ and ISd, is incorrect, (K, * TA,) and ↓ زُؤْبُرٌ<br>\
and ↓ زُوبُرٌ and ↓ زَوْبَرٌ, (K in arts. زأبر and زبر,)<br>\
as also زَغْبَرٌ or زِغْبَرٌ (as in two different copies of<br>\
the K in art. زغبر) or زِغْبِرٌ (as in another copy of<br>\
the K and in the O and TA in the same art.)<br>\
and زَغْبُرٌ (accord. to a copy of the K in that art.)<br>\
or زِغْبُرٌ, (O and TA in that art., and so accord. to<br>\
one copy of the K,) [The nap, or villous substance, upon the surface of a garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth;] what is upon the surface of a new garment, or piece of cloth, like what is upon the<br>\
surface of [the kind of cloth called] خَزّ; (S, TA;)<br>\
the زِئْبِر of [the kind of cloth called] خَزّ, and of a<br>\
قَطِيفَة, and of any garment, or piece of cloth;<br>\
(Lth, TA;) the زغبر of a garment, or piece of<br>\
cloth; (AZ, TA;) or what appears of the دَرْز<br>\
[q. v., here meaning nap, or villous substance,]<br>\
of a garment, or piece of cloth. (IJ, K.) [Hence]<br>\
one says, ذَهَبَتِ الأَيَّامُ بِطَرَاوَتِهِ وَنَفَضَتْ زِئْبِرَهُ (tropical:)  [lit.<br>\
Days took away its freshness, and shook off its<br>\
nap]; meaning its age became old. (A, TA.)<br>\
And ↓ أَخَذَهُ بِزَوْبَرِهِ (S, A, K) and ↓ زَأْبَرِهِ (S, K)<br>\
and ↓ زَبَرِهِ, (K,) as also زَغْبَرِهِ, (S, and K * in art.<br>\
زغبر,) and ↓ زَنَوْبَرِهِ, incorrectly written in the K<br>\
زَبَوْبَرِهِ, (TA,) (assumed tropical:)  He took it altogether, (S, A, K,)<br>\
leaving nothing of it. (S.) Ibn-Ahmar says,<br>\
وَإِنْ قَالَ عَاوٍ مِنْ مَعَدٍّ قَصِيدَةً<br>\
بِهَا جَرَبٌ عُدَّتْ عَلَىَّ بِزَوْبَرَا<br>\
i. e. (assumed tropical:)  [And if a howler of Ma&#39;add utters an ode<br>\
in which is a fault,] it is attributed to me altogether, (S, * L,) when I have not been the<br>\
author of it: (L:) the last word, accord. to<br>\
Aboo-&#39;Alee [El-Fárisee], being imperfectly decl.<br>\
because made a proper name for the قصيدة, and<br>\
therefore combining the two qualities of being<br>\
determinate and being of the fem. gender: so he<br>\
said in answer to a question of IJ: but some say<br>\
that the said word there means a calamity, or<br>\
misfortune: and IB says that it is a proper name<br>\
for a bitch (كلبة [if this be not a mistranscription]), of the fem. gender. (TA. [In one copy<br>\
of the S, I find only the last three words of this<br>\
verse: in another, it commences thus: إِذَا قَالَ<br>\
غَاوٍ مِنْ تَنُوخَ: in the TA, the former reading is<br>\
given, except that غَاوٍ is put in the place of عَاوٍ.])<br>\
One says also, ↓ رَجَعَ بِزَوْبَرِهِ (assumed tropical:)  He returned disappointed, or unsuccessful; (TA;) without having<br>\
obtained anything; (K, TA;) and without having<br>\
accomplished his want. (TA.)<br>\

the former applied to a man, and the latter to a<br>\
lion: (S:) or, accord. to ISd, Khálid Ibn-Kulthoom is in error in saying that the latter is an<br>\
epithet applied to the lion; and that the correct<br>\
word is مَرْزُبَانِىٌّ: the fem. of the former is زَبْرَآءُ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
