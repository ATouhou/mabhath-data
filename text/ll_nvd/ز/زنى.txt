زَنَى, aor. يَزْنِى, inf. n. زِنًى [often written زِنًا]<br>\
and زِنَآءٌ, (S, Mgh, * Msb, K,) the latter an inf. n.<br>\
of 3 (S, Mgh, Msb, K) also, (S, Mgh, K,) but said<br>\
by some to be a dial. var. of the former, (Msb,) the<br>\
former being of the dial. of the people of El-Hijáz,<br>\
(Lh, S, Msb, TA,) and the latter of the dial. of<br>\
Benoo-Temeem, (Lh, TA,) or of the people of<br>\
Nejd, (S, Msb, TA,) He committed fornication<br>\
or adultery; (El-Munáwee, Er-Rághib, TA;) بِهَا<br>\
with her: (MA:) but accord. to El-Munáwee,<br>\
[it seems to be properly a dial. var. of زَنَأَ as<br>\
meaning he mounted; for he says that,] in the<br>\
proper language of the Arabs, الزِّنَا signifies the<br>\
mounting upon a thing; and in the language of<br>\
the law it signifies the commission of the act<br>\
first mentioned above: it is [thus] syn. with فَجَرَ:<br>\
and in like manner one says of a woman [زَنَتْ]:<br>\
(TA:) ↓ زنّى, inf. n. تَزْنِيَةٌ, also signifies the same:<br>\
(TA:) and so does ↓ زانى, inf. n. مُزَانَاةٌ and زِنَآءٌ:<br>\
(K:) one says of a woman, ↓ تُزَانِى, inf. n. مُزَانَاةٌ<br>\
and زِنَآءٌ, meaning تُبَاغِى [i. e. She commits fornication or adultery; or prostitutes herself]. (S.)<br>\
It is said in a prov., لَا حُصْنُهَا حُصْنٌ وَلَا الزِّنَآءُ زِنَآءٌ<br>\
[Her continence is not continence, nor the fornication, or adultery, that she commits, fornication,<br>\
or adultery]: applied to him who does not remain<br>\
in one state, or condition; neither in good nor in<br>\
evil: (Meyd:) or to him who refrains from doing<br>\
good and then is excessive [therein], or from evil<br>\
and then is excessive therein; not continuing to<br>\
pursue one way. (TA.) [See also زَنْيَةٌ.]<br>\
2<br>\
زنّاهُ, inf. n. تَزْنِيَةٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, TA,) He<br>\
said to him يَا زَانِى [O fornicator or adulterer]:<br>\
(S, TA:) or he imputed to him الزِّنَا [i. e. fornication or adultery]; (Mgh, Msb, TA;) and so<br>\
↓ زاناهُ, accord. to the copies of the K; but in the<br>\
M, ↓ ازناهُ, which, it is there said, has not been<br>\
heard except in a trad. of the daughter of El-<br>\
Hasan. (TA.)<br>\

أَزْنَىَ see 2.<br>\
زِنًى, often written زِنًا: see the next paragraph,<br>\
in two places.<br>\
زَنْيَةٌ A single act of الزِّنَى [i. e. fornication or<br>\
adultery]: (Msb, TA:) and ↓ زِنًى is [used in the<br>\
same sense, (though properly an inf. n., not of<br>\
un.,) as is shown by its being] dualized: they say<br>\
زِنَيَانِ: (TA:) [but this is post-classical:] thus<br>\
using the dual of زِنًى, the lawyers say, قَذَفَهُ بِزِنَيَيْنِ<br>\
[He reproached him with two acts of fornication<br>\
or adultery]: (Msb, TA:) but [in this instance,<br>\
and] in the saying ↓ شَهِدَ عَلَى زِنَاءَيْنِ, [which is<br>\
dual of زِنَآءٌ, properly an inf. n. like زِنًى,] or زِنَيَيْنِ,<br>\
[He testified, or gave decisive information, respecting two acts of fornication or adultery,] the<br>\
right word is زَنْيَتَيْنِ. (Mgh.) One says also, هُوَ<br>\
ابْنُ زَنْيَةٍ, and sometimes ↓ زِنْيَةٍ, (K,) but the<br>\
former is the more chaste, (Az, TA,) meaning<br>\
↓ ابْنُ زِنًى [i. e. He is a son of fornication or<br>\
adultery]: (K:) or هُوَ وَلَدُ زَنْيَةٍ and ↓ زِنْيَةٍ, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) and لِزَنْيَةٍ [هُوَ] and ↓ لِزِنْيَةٍ, (Mgh,) with fet-h<br>\
and with kesr, [meaning as above, or وُلِدَ لِزَنْيَةٍ<br>\
He is, or was, born of fornication or adultery,]<br>\
contr. of وَلَدُ رِشْدَةٍ and لِرِشْدَةٍ, (Mgh,) or contr. of<br>\
هُوَ لِرِشْدَةٍ: (Msb:) or ↓ هُوَ لِزِنْيَةٍ and لِزَنْيَةٍ, [He<br>\
is the offspring of fornication or adultery,] contr.<br>\
of لِرِشْدَةٍ and لِرَشْدَةٍ: (S:) accord. to Fr, one says,<br>\
هُوَ لِغَيِّةٍ and لِزَنْيَةٍ and لِغَيْرِ رَشْدَةٍ, [all meaning the<br>\
same, and] all with fet-h: accord. to Ks, however, one may say ↓ زِنْيَة and رِشْدَة, with kesr, but<br>\
غَيَّة only with fet-h: (TA:) ISk says that زنية<br>\
and غيّة are both with kesr and fet-h. (Msb.)<br>\
زِنْيَةٌ [accord. to analogy signifies A mode, or<br>\
manner, of fornication or adultery]. See the next<br>\
preceding paragraph, in five places.<br>\
-A2-  Also The<br>\
last of a man&#39;s children; (K;) like as فِجْرَةٌ signifies the “ last of a woman&#39;s children. ” (TA.)<br>\
زِنَآءٌ [properly an inf. n., but having a dual<br>\
assigned to it]: see an instance of its dual voce<br>\
زَنْيَةٌ<br>\
زِنَوِىٌّ [meaning Of, or relating to, fornication<br>\
or adultery] is the rel. n. from زِنًى; (S, Msb;)<br>\
the [radical] ى being changed into و because<br>\
three ىs are deemed difficult of pronunciation:<br>\
(Msb:) and the rel. n. from زِنَآءٌ [having the same<br>\
meaning] is ↓ زِنَآئِىٌّ. (S.)<br>\
زِنَائِىٌّ: see what next precedes.<br>\
زَنَّآءَةٌ an appellation applied to A female ape<br>\
(قِرْدَةٌ). (S.)<br>\
زَانٍ act. part. n. of زَنَى: [signifying Committing fornication or adultery: and also a fornicator or an adulterer:] (Msb:) fem. زَانِيَةٌ:<br>\
(Kur xxiv. 2 and 3:) pl. masc. زُنَاةٌ, like قُضَاةٌ pl.<br>\
of قَاضٍ: (Msb:) [and pl. fem. زَوَانٍ.] يَا زَانِى<br>\
said to a woman is correct as being [for يَا زَانِيَةُ,<br>\
O fornicatress, or adulteress,] apocopated. (Mgh.)<br>\
زَانِيَةٌ fem. of زَانٍ [q. v.] ―<br>\
-b2-  Applied to a man,<br>\
it has an intensive meaning [i. e. One much addicted to fornication or adultery]. (Mgh.)<br>\
