زَفِرَ, (S, K,) inf. n. زَفِيرٌ (S, A, K) and<br>\
رَفْرٌ (K) and إِزْفِيرٌ, (M, [like إِرْزِيزٌ, app. an inf. n.,<br>\
or perhaps a simple subst.,]) He drew in his<br>\
breath to the utmost, by reason of distress: (S:)<br>\
it originally signifies he drew back his breath<br>\
vehemently, so that his ribs became swollen out:<br>\
(Er-Rághib:) زَفِيرٌ is the beginning of the cry of<br>\
the ass, (Lth, S, A, Er-Rághib,) and of the like,<br>\
(Lth,) and is generally used in this sense; (Er-Rághib;) and شَهِيقٌ is the ending thereof; (Lth,<br>\
S, A, Er-Rághib;) for the former is the drawing<br>\
in of the breath, and the latter is the sending it<br>\
forth: (Lth, S:) or the verb signifies he sent forth<br>\
his breath, after prolonging it: (M, K:) or he<br>\
sent forth his breath with a prolonged sound:<br>\
[i. e., he sighed, or uttered a long sigh, or sighed<br>\
vehemently; or he groaned:] or he filled his<br>\
chest, by reason of grief, and then sent forth his<br>\
breath: (TA:) or he breathed, raising his voice,<br>\
like one moaning, or in grief. (Har p. 20.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Hence,] زَفَرَتِ النَّارُ (assumed tropical:)  The fire made a sound to be<br>\
heard from its burning, or its fierce burning:<br>\
(K:) and this [sounding] is termed زَفِيرٌ. (TA.)<br>\
[See also حَدْمٌ; where زَفْرٌ, its inf. n., is expl., on<br>\
the authority of AZ, as signifying The flaming,<br>\
or blazing, of fire.] And البَحْرُ يَزْفِرُ بِتَمَوُّجِهِ (tropical:)  [The<br>\

زَفَّرَ see the next paragraph.<br>\

تزفّر occurs in the Saheeh of El-Bukháree<br>\
as meaning تَخَبَّطَ [q. v.]: but El-Jelál says, in<br>\
the Towsheeh, that this is not known in the language of the Arabs. (MF.)<br>\
-A2-  [Freytag explains<br>\
it as meaning He ate fat food, breaking the fast;<br>\
like ↓ زفّر; (which latter generally means, in the<br>\
present day, he rendered greasy;) but this I<br>\
believe to be post-classical. See De Sacy&#39;s Chrest.<br>\
Ar., sec. ed., i. 270.]<br>\

إِزْتَفَرَ see 1, near the end of the paragraph.<br>\
زِفْرٌ A load, or burden, syn. حِمْلٌ, (S, A, K,) on<br>\

This signification and that of حِمْلٌ are both<br>\
correct. (TA.)<br>\
زَفَرٌ A prop of a tree. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [In modern<br>\
Arabic, it means Grease, greasy food, or flesh-meat: app. from the Pers. زَفَرْ or زَفْر, signifying<br>\
“ filth: ” and hence, obscenity. Hence also the<br>\
vulgar epithet زِفِر (app. for زَفِرٌ), meaning Greasy:<br>\
and foul, or filthy: and obscene. See 5.]<br>\

long or vehement sigh; or a groan: or an emission of the breath after filling the chest with it by<br>\
reason of grief: (see, again, 1:)] pl. زَفَرَاتٌ, because<br>\
it is a subst., not an epithet; but sometimes, by<br>\
poetic license, زَفْرَاتٌ. (S.) El-Jaadee says,<br>\
يَرْجِعْ عَلَى دِقَّةٍ وَلَاهَضَمِ  خِيطَ عَلَىزَفْرَةٍ فَتَمَّ وَلَمْ<br>\
meaning As though he were sewed up after a<br>\

of distress, so that he seemed to be constantly so<br>\

the forms of more than one of these words, and<br>\
from what follows, and also from an explanation<br>\
of مُزْدَفَرٌ, below.] (K, TA.) ―<br>\
