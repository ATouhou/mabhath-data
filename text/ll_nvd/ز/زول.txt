to nought]. (TA.) And زال زَوَالُهُ, and زَوَالُهَا:<br>\
see زَوَالٌ: and for the former see also زَوِيلٌ. And<br>\
زال زَوِيلُهُ, and زَوِيلُهَا: see زَوِيلٌ. And زال الشَّىْءُ<br>\

(K.) You say, ازالهُ عَنِ المَوْضِعِ He removed it<br>\
from the place. (MA: and the like is said in<br>\
the K.) [And ازال عَنْهُ كَذَا He removed from<br>\
him such a thing; made it to go away, pass away,<br>\
or cease, from him; or to leave him, or quit him;<br>\
he freed him from it, or rid him of it. And<br>\

a distance: or a person: syn. شَخْصٌ: (K, TA:)<br>\
as also ↓ زَائِلَةٌ: see 1, near the end of the paragraph. (TA.)<br>\
-A4-  The فَرْج [i. e. the anterior<br>\

زَوَالٌ (S, Msb, K) and ↓ زَوِيلٌ and ↓ زَوْلٌ (K)<br>\
are inf. ns. of زَالَ [q. v.]. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
all signify Motion, commotion, or agitation.<br>\
(TA in explanation of the first and last, and K<br>\
in explanation of the second.) [Hence,] ↓ زَالَ<br>\
زَوَالُهُ, or زَوَالَهُ ↓ زَالَ, (accord. to different copies<br>\
of the K,) or اللّٰهُ زَوَالَهُ ↓ زَالَ, (S in art. زيل, and<br>\
TA,) and اللّٰهُ زَوَالَهُ ↓ أَزَالَ, (S in art. زيل, and K<br>\
and TA,) are imprecations of destruction, or<br>\
perdition, or death, (S, K,) and trial, or affliction,<br>\
upon him to whom they relate: (S:) or such are<br>\
the [second and] third and fourth of these phrases:<br>\
but the first is a prayer for one&#39;s continuance<br>\
where he is, [or his continuance in life; lit.]<br>\
meaning May his motion cease; [and hence, may<br>\
he continue where he is, or continue in life:] and,<br>\
as expl. by ISk, the [second and] third and<br>\
fourth [lit.] signify May [He i. e.] God cause<br>\
his motion to cease; [and hence, may He, or God,<br>\
put an end to his life;] these phrases being<br>\
similar to the saying أَسْكَتَ اللّٰهُ نَامَّتَهُ. (TA.)<br>\
[Thus all four have virtually the same lit. signification. And the first has also another meaning;<br>\
as will be seen below.] El-Aashà says,<br>\
هٰذَا النَّهَارُ بَدَا لَهَا مِنْ هَمِّهَا<br>\
زَوَالَهَا ↓ مَا بَالُهَا بِاللَّيْلِ زَالَ<br>\
(S, TA,) [app. meaning This is the day-time:<br>\
an opinion has arisen in her mind such as to<br>\
turn her from her former opinion and induce her<br>\
to absent herself, (بَدَآءٌ, I suppose, being understood after بَدَا لَهَا, like as it is after بَدَا لَهُمْ in the<br>\
Kur xii. 35,) in consequence of her anxiety: what<br>\
will be her case in the night? may it (her<br>\
phantom) be absent, like as she is absent: for]<br>\
the meaning is said to be, زَالَ الخَيَالُ زَوَالَهَا: IAar<br>\
says, he disliked the phantom only because it<br>\
roused his desire: or [زَالَ may be here syn. with<br>\
أَزَالَ, so that] the meaning may be اللّٰهُ زَوَالَهَا ↓ أَزَالَ<br>\
[may God make her motion to cease]; and this<br>\
is corroborated by the reading of AA, زَوَالُهَا, in<br>\
the nom. case, [i. e. زَوَالُهَا ↓ زَالَ may her motion<br>\
cease;] which makes this an instance of [the<br>\
license termed] الإِقْوَآء: this, he says, is an old<br>\
proverbial phrase of the Arabs, and El-Aashà<br>\
has used it as he heard it: others than AA read<br>\
[زَوَالَهَا,] in the accus. case, without إِقْوَآء, holding<br>\
the meaning to be, may her phantom be absent<br>\
from us in the night like as she herself is absent<br>\
in the day-time. (TA.) ↓ زَوِيلُهُ ↓ زِيلَ, likewise,<br>\
means His motion ceased, or may his motion<br>\
cease: or, accord. to Z, he became fixed, or motionless, from fear; or may he become so. (TA<br>\
in art. زيل.) [See also another rendering of this<br>\
phrase in the next paragraph.] One says also,<br>\
وَالعَوِيلُ ↓ أَخَذَهُ الزَّوِيلُ Commotion, or agitation,<br>\
(K, TA,) and disquietude of mind, (TA,) and<br>\
wailing, or raising of the voice in weeping, overcame him. (K, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also the next paragraph, in three places.<br>\
زَوِيلٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in<br>\
three places.<br>\
-A2-  Also The side; syn. جَانِبٌ; and<br>\
so ↓ زَوَالٌ: thus in the sayings, زَوِيلُهُ ↓ زَالَ and<br>\
↓ زَوَالُهُ ↓ زَالَ, meaning [app. His side became in a<br>\
state of commotion, or it quivered,] by reason of<br>\
fright: (K:) [or] زَوِيلٌ signifies the heart: so<br>\
in the saying, زَوِيلُهُ ↓ زِيلَ [His heart became removed from its place]: (S:) a prov., applied to<br>\
one whom an event that has disquieted him has<br>\
befallen: as also ↓ زَوَالُهُ ↓ زِيلَ: (Meyd:) [see<br>\
also two other renderings of the former phrase in<br>\
the next preceding paragraph:] Dhu-r-Rummeh<br>\
says, describing the egg of an ostrich,<br>\
وَيَيْضَآءُ لَا تَنْحَاشُ مِنَّا وَأُمُّهَا<br>\
مِنَّا زَوِيلُهَا ↓ إِذَا مَا رَأَتْنَا زِيلَ<br>\
meaning زِيلَ قَلْبُهَا مِنَ الفَزَعِ [i. e. And a white<br>\
thing (the egg which he is describing) will not<br>\
take fright, and flee from us, or will not shrink<br>\
from us, while its mother, when she sees us, her<br>\
heart becomes removed from its place by fright in<br>\
consequence of the approach of us]: (S in art.<br>\
زيل, and Meyd:) or, as some relate it, مِنَّا ↓ زَالَ<br>\
زَوِيلُهَا [which means her heart quits its place &amp;c.]:<br>\
(TA:) and the former reading may mean the<br>\
same as this. (IB, TA in art. زيل.)<br>\
زَوَّالٌ Having much زَوْل, i. e. motion. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Accord. to J, it occurs in an أُرْجُوزَة, cited by AA,<br>\
as meaning That moves much in his gait, but<br>\
traverses a short space: but the right word in<br>\
this case is زَوَّاك, as is shown by the rhyme.<br>\
(IB, K.)<br>\
زويلى, with damm, [app. زُوَّيْلَى, like قُبَّيْطَى<br>\
&amp;c., for, as it is not said to be a dim., I know no<br>\
other form of word with which to compare it,] A<br>\
thing like a ladle, belonging to sailors. (TA.)<br>\
زَائِلٌ [Going away; passing away; departing;<br>\
transient; shifting; becoming remote, or absent;<br>\
ceasing to be or exist; nonexistent: &amp;c.: part. n.<br>\
of زَالَ, q. v.]. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] لَيْلٌ زَائِلُ النُّجُومِ [properly A starless night, or night of which the stars<br>\
are absent: but expl. as meaning] (assumed tropical:)  a long night.<br>\
(Z, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  زَالَ زَائِلُ الظِّلِّ: see 1.<br>\
زَائِلَةٌ [from زَائِلٌ, the ة being affixed to transfer<br>\
the word from the category of epithets to that of<br>\
substantives,] Whatever has a soul, (K, TA,) of<br>\
animals; that moves (يَزُولُ) from its place:<br>\
(TA:) or anything that moves; (K, TA;) that<br>\
does not remain fixed in its place; applied to a<br>\
man and to other things. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  زَوَائِلُ is its<br>\
pl.: (TA:) and signifies [particularly] Animals<br>\
of the chase. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,] (tropical:)  Women.<br>\
(O, K, TA.) One says رَجُلٌ رَامِى الزَّوَائِلِ (assumed tropical:)  A<br>\
man knowing in respect of the diseases, or faults,<br>\
(أَدْوَآء,) of women: (O:) or (tropical:)  skilful in the making<br>\
of women to incline to him: whence the saying<br>\
of Ibn-Meiyádeh,<br>\
وَكُنْتُ امْرَأً أَرْمِى الزَّوَائِلَ مَرَّةً<br>\
فَأَصْبَحْتُ قَدْ وَدَعْتُ رَمْىَ الزَّوَائِلِ<br>\
(tropical:)  [And I was a man having the art of making<br>\
women to incline to me, once; but I have become<br>\
such that I have relinquished the art of making<br>\
women to incline to me]: this was a man who<br>\
used to beguile women in his time of youthful<br>\
vigour by his beauty; but when he became hoary<br>\
and aged, no woman inclined to him. (TA.) ―<br>\
