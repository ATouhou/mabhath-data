زَأْبَقَ He did over dirhems, or pieces of<br>\
money, with زِئْبِق [i. e. quicksilver]. (Mgh.) [It<br>\
is said that] the verb [from زئبق, or rather its<br>\
inf. n.,] is التَّزْبِيقُ: (TA:) [but see مَزَأْبَقٌ, below.]<br>\
زِئْبِقٌ, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) thus pronounced by<br>\
some, (S,) and this is the form preferred by ElMeydánee, and that which is in the Fs and its<br>\
Expositions, (TA,) rendered quasi-coordinate to<br>\
زِئْبِرٌ and ضِئْبِلٌ, (S, in which it is mentioned in<br>\
art. زبق,) also pronounced زِئْبَقٌ, (S, K, [in both<br>\
of which it is implied that this is the more common form, and such is the case now,]) and it<br>\
is allowable to pronounce it زِيبِقٌ, (Msb,) an<br>\
arabicized word, (S, K,) of well-known meaning,<br>\
[i. e. Quicksilver,] (Msb, K,) originally Pers.<br>\
[Cِيوَهْ and زِيبَقْ or زِيبِقْ]; (S;) i. q. زَاوُوقٌ: (Mgh,<br>\
TA:) some of it is drawn in a fluid state from<br>\
its mine, and some is extracted from stones of the<br>\
mine by means of fire: its smoke, or vapour, puts<br>\
to flight serpents and scorpions from the house,<br>\
or kills such of them as remain [therein]. (K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, as being likened thereto, (TA,) زِئْبِقٌ<br>\
and زِئْبَقٌ signify also (tropical:)  A man who is light, inconstant, unsteady, irresolute, or fickle. (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, TA.)<br>\
[<br>\
زِئْبَقِىٌّ Of, or relating to, quicksilver. ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
A seller of quicksilver.]<br>\
دِرْهَمٌ مُزَأْبَقٌ, (Lth, S, Mgh, TA,) said by Th to<br>\
be correctly مَزَأْبِقٌ, with kesr to the ب, (TA in<br>\
art. زبق, [but this is app. a mistake,]) or مُزَيْبَقٌ,<br>\
with fet-h to the ب, (Msb,) A dirhem, or piece<br>\
of money, done over with زئبق [i. e. quicksilver]:<br>\
(Lth, Mgh, Msb, TA:) the vulgar say مُزَبَّقٌ.<br>\
