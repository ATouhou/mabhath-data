He, or it, adorned, ornamented, decorated,<br>\
decked, bedecked, garnished, embellished, beautified, or graced, him, or it. (MA, KL, PS: [and<br>\
the like is indicated in the S and Msb and K.])<br>\
[زَانَهُ said of a quality, and of an action, and of a<br>\
saying, is best rendered It adorned him, or<br>\
graced him, or was an honour to him; contr. of<br>\
شَانَهُ; as is indicated in the S and K: and sometimes means it was his pride: and ↓ زيّنهُ means<br>\
as expl. above: and he embellished it, dressed it<br>\
up, or trimmed it; said in this sense as relating<br>\
to language: and he embellished it, or dressed it<br>\
up, namely, an action &amp;c. to another (لِغَيْرِهِ);<br>\
often said in this sense of the Devil; (as in the<br>\
Kur vi. 43, &amp;c.;) i. e. he commended it to him:]<br>\
زَانَهُ كَذَا and ↓ زيّنهُ [Such a thing adorned him,<br>\
&amp;c.,] are expl. as said when one&#39;s excellence<br>\
[فَضْلُهُ, as I read for فعله, an evident mistranscription,] appears either by speech or by action:<br>\
and اللّٰهِ لِلْأَشْيَآءِ ↓ تَزْيِينُ [God&#39;s adorning, &amp;c., of<br>\
things] is sometimes by means of his creating<br>\
them مُزَيَّنَة [i. e. adorned, &amp;c.]; and النَّاسِ ↓ تَزْيِينُ<br>\
[The adorning, &amp;c., of men], by their abundance<br>\
of property, and by their speech, i. e. by their<br>\
extolling Him. (Er-Rághib, TA.) One says,<br>\
زَانَهُ الحُسْنُ [Beauty adorned, or graced, him, or<br>\
it]. And Mejnoon says,<br>\
فَيَا رَبِّ إِذْ صَيَّرْتَ لَيْلَى لِىَ الهَوَى<br>\
فَزِنِّى لِعَيْنَيْهَا كَمَا زِنْتَهَا لِيَا<br>\
[And, O my Lord, since Thou hast made Leylà<br>\
to be to me the object of love, then grace Thou me<br>\
to her eyes like as Thou hast graced her to me].<br>\
(S, TA: but in the former, مِنَ الهَوى in the place<br>\
of لِىَ الهَوَى. [The reading in the S means of the<br>\
objects of love: for هَوًى, being originally an<br>\
inf. n., may be used alike as sing. and pl.])<br>\
السِّلْعَةِ فِى البَيْعِ ↓ تَزْيِينُ [means The setting off,<br>\
or commending, of a commodity in selling; and]<br>\
is allowed, if without concealment of a fault, or<br>\
defect, from the purchaser, and without lying in<br>\

(S,) quasi-pass. verbs, [the former of زَيَّنَهُ and<br>\
the latter of زَانَهُ,] (K,) signify the same; (S;)<br>\
[He, or it, was, or became, adorned, ornamented,<br>\
decorated, decked, bedecked, garnished, embel-lished, beautified, or graced;] as also اِزَّيَّنَ, (S, *<br>\
K,) [a variation of the first, being] originally<br>\
تَزَيَّنَ, the ت being made quiescent, and incorporated into the ز, and the ا being prefixed in order<br>\
that the inception may be perfect; (S, TA;)<br>\
and ↓ ازيانّ; and ↓ ازينّ. (K.) One says, ↓ أَزْيَنَتِ<br>\
الأَرْضُ بِعُشْبِهَا [perhaps a mistranscription for<br>\
↓ اِزْيَنَّتِ The earth, or land, became adorned,<br>\
&amp;c., with, or by, its herbage]; as also اِزَّيَّنَت,<br>\
originally تَزَيَّنَت [as expl. above]; (S;) and<br>\
some, in the Kur x. 25, read تَزَيَّنَت; and some,<br>\
↓ ازيانّت. (Bd.) And they said, إِذَا طَلَعَتِ الجَبْهَةُ<br>\
تَزَيَّنَتِ النَّخْلَةُ [When الجبهة (the Tenth Mansion<br>\
of the Moon) rises aurorally, the palm-tree<br>\
becomes garnished with ripening dates: that<br>\
Mansion thus rose in central Arabia, about the<br>\
commencement of the era of the Flight, on the<br>\
12th of August, O. S; and in that region, at, or<br>\
soon after, that period, the dates begin to ripen].<br>\
(TA.) [تزيّن is said of language, as meaning It<br>\
was embellished, dressed up, or trimmed: and of<br>\
an action &amp;c., as meaning it was embellished, or<br>\
dressed up, i. e. commended, to a person, by<br>\
another man, and, more commonly, by the<br>\
Devil.] ―<br>\
-b2-  And تزيّن also signifies He adorned,<br>\
ornamented, decorated, decked, &amp;c., himself.<br>\
(MA, KL.) [Hence,] تزيّن بِالبَاطِلِ [He invested himself with that which did not belong to<br>\
him]. (S and TA in art. شبع.)<br>\

زَانٌ: see art. زون.<br>\
زَيْنٌ [as an inf. n., and also as a simple subst.,]<br>\
is the contr. of شَيْنٌ: (S, Msb, K:) [as a simple<br>\
subst.,] i. q. زِينَةٌ, q. v.: (Har p. 139:) [and<br>\
commonly signifying A grace; a beauty; a<br>\
comely quality; a physical, and also an intel-lectual, adornment; an honour, or a credit; and<br>\
anything that is the pride, or glory, of a person<br>\
or thing: in these senses contr. of شَيْنٌ:] pl. أَزْيَانٌ.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Az says, I heard a boy of [the tribe<br>\
called] Benoo- &#39;Okeyl say to another, وَجْهِى زَيْنٌ<br>\
وَوَجْهُكَ شَيْنٌ, meaning My face is comely and thy<br>\
face is ugly; for وَجْهِى ذُو زَيْنٍ وَوَجْهُكَ ذُو شَيْنٍ<br>\
[my face is possessed of comeliness and thy face<br>\
is possessed of ugliness]; using the inf. ns. as<br>\
epithets; like as one says رَجُلٌ صَوْمٌ and عَدْلٌ.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also The comb of the cock. (S.)<br>\
زَانَةٌ [mentioned in this art. in the K]: see art.<br>\
زون.<br>\
زِينَةٌ, the subst. from زَانَهُ, (Msb,) signifies<br>\
مَا يُتَزَيَّنُ بِهِ [i. e. A thing with which, or by which,<br>\
one is adorned, ornamented, decorated, decked,<br>\
bedecked, garnished, embellished, beautified, or<br>\
graced; or with which, or by which, one adorns,<br>\
&amp;c., himself]; (T, S, K;) any such thing; (T,<br>\
TA;) [any ornament, ornature, decoration, garnish, embellishment, or grace;] and so ↓ زِيانٌ;<br>\
(K;) and ↓ زَيْنٌ, also, [which see above,] signifies<br>\
the same as زِينَةٌ: (Har p. 139:) accord. to El-<br>\
Harállee, زِينَةٌ denotes the [means of] beautifying,<br>\
or embellishing, a thing by another thing; consisting of apparel, or an ornament of gold or<br>\
silver or of jewels or gems, or aspect: or, as some<br>\
say, it is the beauty [seen] of the eye that does<br>\
not reach to the interior of that which is adorned<br>\
[thereby]: accord. to Er-Rághib, its proper mean-<br>\
ing is a thing that does not disgrace, or render<br>\
unseemly, a man, in any of his states or conditions,<br>\
either in the present world or in that which is to<br>\
come: but that which adorns him in one state or<br>\
condition, exclusively of another, is in one point<br>\
of view شَيْنٌ: summarily speaking, it is of three<br>\
kinds; namely, mental, such as knowledge or<br>\
science, and good tenets; and bodily, such as<br>\
strength, and tallness of stature, and beauty of<br>\
aspect; and extrinsic, such as wealth, and rank<br>\
or station or dignity; and all these are mentioned<br>\
in the Kur: (TA:) the pl. is زِيَنٌ. (Bd in x. 25.)<br>\
زِينَةُ الحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا [or simply زِينَةُ الدُّنْيَا generally<br>\
means The ornature, finery, show, pomp, or<br>\
gaiety, of the present life or world; and] particularly includes wealth and children. (Kur<br>\
xviii. 44.) زِينَةُ الأَرْضِ [The ornature of the<br>\
earth] means the plants, or herbage, of the earth.<br>\
(TA.) يَوْمُ الزِّينَةِ [The day of ornature] is the<br>\
festival (العِيدُ); (S, K;) when men used [and<br>\
still use] to adorn themselves with goodly articles<br>\
of apparel. (TA.) And also The day of the<br>\
breaking [of the dam a little within the entrance]<br>\
of the canal of Misr [here meaning the present<br>\
capital of Egypt, El-Káhireh, which we call<br>\
“ Cairo ”], (K, TA,) i. e. the canal which runs<br>\
through the midst of Misr, and [the dam of]<br>\
which is broken when the Nile has attained the<br>\
height of sixteen cubits or more: this day is said<br>\
to be meant in the Kur xx. 61: it is one of the<br>\
days observed in Egypt with the greatest gladness<br>\
and rejoicing from ancient times; and its observance in the days of the Fátimees was such as is<br>\
inconceivable, as it is described in the “ Khitat ”<br>\
of El-Makreezee. (TA. [The modern observances<br>\
of this day, and of other days in relation to the<br>\
rise of the Nile, are described in my work on the<br>\
Modern Egyptians.])<br>\
قَمَرٌ زَيَانٌ A beautiful moon. (K.)<br>\
زِيَانٌ: see زِينَةٌ.<br>\

زِيَانَةٌ The art, or occupation, of the مُزَيِّن: so<br>\
in the present day.]<br>\
زَائِنٌ: see the last paragraph in this art.<br>\
مُزَيَّنٌ: see مُتَزَيِّنٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also,] applied to a man,<br>\
Having his hair trimmed, or clipped, [or shaven,<br>\
by the مُزَيِّن.] (S, TA.)<br>\
مُزَيِّنٌ i. q. حَجَّامٌ [i. e. A cupper; who is<br>\
generally a barber; and to the latter this epithet<br>\
(مُزَيِّنٌ) is now commonly applied; as it is also<br>\
in the MA]. (S, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See also مُتَزَيِّنٌ.<br>\
مُزَيِّينٌ: see مُتَزَيِّنٌ.<br>\
مُزَّانٌ: see each in two places in what<br>\
follows.<br>\
مُزْدَانٌ: see each in two places in what<br>\
follows.<br>\
مُتَزَيِّنٌ and ↓ مُزْدَانٌ and ↓ مُزَّانٌ signify the same<br>\
[i. e. Adorned, ornamented, decorated, decked,<br>\
bedecked, garnished, embellished, or graced; as<br>\
also ↓ مُزَيَّنٌ: and the first signifies also selfadorned &amp;c.]: (TA:) the second and third are<br>\
part. ns. of اِزْدَانَ; the third being formed from<br>\
the second by incorporation [of the د into the ز]:<br>\
and the dim. of مُزْدَانٌ is ↓ مُزَيِّنٌ, like مُخَيِّرٌ the<br>\
dim. of مُخْتَارٌ; and if you substitute [for the د],<br>\
↓ مُزَيِّينٌ: and in like manner in forming the pl.<br>\
you say مَزَايِنُ and مَزَايِينُ. (S.) You say, أَنَا<br>\
بِإِعْلَامِكَ ↓ مُزَّانٌ and ↓ مُزْدَانٌ, meaning مُتَزَيِّنٌ<br>\
بِإِعْلَامِ أَمْرِكَ [i. e. I am graced by the making<br>\
known of thy command, or affair]. (TA.) And<br>\
↓ اِمْرَأَةٌ زَائِنٌ means مُتَزَيِّنَةٌ [i. e. A woman adorned,<br>\
&amp;c.; or self-adorned &amp;c.]: (K, TA:) in [some<br>\
of] the copies of the K, erroneously, مُتَزَيِّنٌ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
