زَهَا, said of seed-produce, It increased, or<br>\
augmented; received increase and blessing from<br>\
God; or throve by the blessing of God: (JK,<br>\
TA:) [or,] said of herbage, aor. يَزْهُو, inf. n. زَهْوٌ,<br>\
it attained its full growth: (Msb:) or it put<br>\
forth its fruit: or it became tall: (TA:) and,<br>\
said of palm-trees, (نَخْلٌ, S, Msb, K, TA,) and<br>\
likewise of plants, (TA,) aor. as above, (Msb,<br>\
TA,) and so the inf. n., (S, Msb, TA,) they<br>\
became tall; (K, TA;) became tall and fullgrown; or became of their full height, and<br>\
blossomed; (TA;) and ↓ ازهى signifies the same:<br>\
(K:) or both signify they (i. e. palm-trees) showed<br>\
redness, and yellowness, in their fruit; (S, Msb;)<br>\
the latter verb mentioned by AZ, but [it is said<br>\
that] As did not know it: (S: [see, however,<br>\
what follows:]) or, as some say, the former signifies they put forth their fruit; and ↓ the latter,<br>\
as expl. next before: (Msb:) accord. to Abu-lKhattáb and Lth, one says of palm-trees (نَخْل)<br>\
only يُزْهِى; not يَزْهُو: and As [is related to have]<br>\
said, [contr. to what has been asserted of him<br>\
above,] that when redness appears in [the fruit<br>\
of] palm-trees, one says ازهى. (TA.) And زَهَا<br>\
التَّمْرُ, (JK,) or البُسْرُ; and ↓ ازهى; (Mgh, K;)<br>\
and ↓ زهّى, (K,) inf. n. تَزْهِيَةٌ; (TA;) [The dates,<br>\
or dates beginning to ripen,] showed their goodness by redness, and yellowness: (JK:) became<br>\
red, and yellow: (Mgh:) became coloured. (K.)<br>\
Hence the trad., نَهَى عَنْ بَيْعِ ثَمَرِ النَّخْلِ حَتَّى يَزْهُوَ,<br>\
or ↓ يُزْهِىَ, [He forbade the selling of the fruit of<br>\
the palm-trees until its becoming red or yellow],<br>\
thus differently related. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also,<br>\
زَهَا الغُلَامُ, (K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (TA,)<br>\
The boy grew up; or attained to youthful vigour,<br>\
or the prime of manhood. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And زَهَتِ<br>\
الشَّاةُ, (JK, S, K,) aor. as above, (S,) and so the<br>\
inf. n., (JK, S,) The ewe, or she-goat, became<br>\
large in her udder: (JK:) or secreted milk in<br>\
her udder, and was near to bringing forth. (AZ,<br>\
S, K. *) ―<br>\
-b4-  And زَهَتِ الرِّيحُ The wind rose, blew,<br>\
or became in a state of commotion. (S.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And<br>\
زَهَتِ الإِبِلُ, (JK, S, M, K,) aor. as above, (JK,<br>\
M,) and so the inf. n., (S, M,) The camels journeyed, after coming to water, (JK, S, M, K,) a<br>\
night or more, (JK, S, M,) so says A&#39;Obeyd, (S,)<br>\
or a night or two nights. (K.) And The camels<br>\
passed along, (مَرَّت,) so in the copies of the K,<br>\
but correctly مَدَّت [i. e. made much advance in<br>\
journeying], as in the M, (TA,) in search of<br>\
pasturage, after they had drunk, (K, TA,) not<br>\
pasturing around the water. (TA.) The verb<br>\
used in relation to camels is also trans., as will<br>\
be shown below. (S, &amp;c.)<br>\
-A2-  زَهْوٌ [as inf. n. of the<br>\
trans. v. زَهَا, aor. يَزْهَى,] primarily signifies The<br>\
act of raising, or elevating: and the act of shaking;<br>\
or putting in motion, or into a state of commotion:<br>\
whence زَهَاهُ السَّرَابُ and زَهَتِ الرِّيحُ النَّبَاتَ [both<br>\
expl. in what follows]. (Har p. 171.) You say,<br>\
زَهَتِ الأَمْوَاجُ السَّفِينَةَ The waves raised the ship.<br>\
(TA.) And زَهَا السَّرَابُ الشَّىْءَ, aor. يَزْهَاهُ, The<br>\
mirage raised, or elevated, [to the eye,] the thing<br>\
[seen in it or beyond it; or rather, made it to<br>\
appear tall, and as though quivering, vibrating,<br>\
or playing up and down; as is perhaps meant to<br>\
be indicated by the citation above from Har];<br>\
syn. رَفَعَهُ; written only [thus] with ا [in the pret.<br>\
and in the aor.]: (S:) and السَّرَابُ يَزْهَى القُبُورَ<br>\
وَالحُمُولَ The mirage is as though it raised the<br>\
tombs and the women&#39;s camel-vehicles; or elevated<br>\
them; expl. by the words كَأَنَّهُ يَرْفَعُهَا. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And زَهَا المِرْوَحَةَ, said of a person fanning, He<br>\
put in motion the fan; or put it into a state of<br>\
commotion; as also ↓ زَهَّاهَا. (TA.) And زَهَتِ<br>\
الرِيحُ الشَّجَرَ, (S,) or النَّبَاتَ, (K, * TA,) aor. تَزْهَاهُ,<br>\
(S, TA,) inf. n. زَهْوٌ, (K, TA,) The wind shook,<br>\
or put in motion or into a state of commotion,<br>\
(S, K, * TA,) the trees, (S,) or the plants, or<br>\
herbage, after the dew or rain (غِبَّ النَّدَى). (K,<br>\
TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And زَهَاهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. زَهْوٌ; (K, TA;)<br>\
and ↓ ازدهاهُ, (S, TA,) inf. n. اِزْدِهَآءٌ; (K, TA;)<br>\
[not ازهاهُ, as in the TK, followed by Freytag;]<br>\
i. q. اِسْتَخَفَّهُ: (S, K, * TA:) and تَهَاوَنَ بِهِ: (S:)<br>\
[the former of these two explanations as meaning<br>\
He, or it, incited him, or excited him, to briskness, liveliness, or sprightliness; or to lightness,<br>\
levity, or unsteadiness: and the latter of them,<br>\
or both of them, for the former is often syn. with<br>\
the latter, as meaning he held him, or it, in little,<br>\
or light, estimation or account, or in contempt;<br>\
he contemned, or despised, him, or it: but of this<br>\
latter meaning I do not remember to have met<br>\
with any ex.:] and بِهِ ↓ ازدهى signifies the same<br>\
as ازدهاه (TA) meaning تَهَاوَنَ بِهِ. (JK.) You<br>\
say, زَهَاهُ الشَّىْءُ and ↓ ازدهاهُ, meaning [agreeably<br>\
with the former of the two explanations in the<br>\
sentence immediately preceding] اِسْتَخَفَّهُ طَرَبًا:<br>\
(Har p. 359:) and ↓ يَزْدَهِينِى as meaning [agreeably with the same explanation] يَسْتَفِزُّنِى and<br>\
يَسْتَخِفُّنِى: (Id. p. 131:) and القَوْمَ ↓ ازدهى as<br>\
meaning [in like manner] اِسْتَخَفَّهُمْ مِنَ الطَّرَبِ;<br>\
and also as meaning He pleased the people, or<br>\
party: (Id. p. 427:) and ↓ اِزْدَهَاهُ also as meaning حَمَلَهُ عَلَى الزَّهْوِ [He incited him, or excited<br>\
him, to pride, or conceit, or the like]: (Id. p. 131:)<br>\
and زَهَاهُ الكِبْرُ (K) Pride rendered him self-conceited. (TK.) &#39;Omar Ibn-&#39;Abee-Rabeea says,<br>\
وَلَمَّا تَقَاوَضْنَا الحَدِيثَ وَأَسْفَرَتْ<br>\
وُجُوهٌ زَهَاهَا الحُسْنُ أَنْ تَتَقَنَّعَا<br>\
meaning And when we discoursed together, and<br>\
faces shone, beauty excited the possessors of them<br>\
to levity (اِسْتَخَفَّ أَرْبَابَهَا) and prevented their veiling them with the قِنَاع [or head-covering], by<br>\
reason of self-admiration: or, as some say, the ها<br>\
in زهاها refers to a woman mentioned before, not<br>\
to وجوه; and the meaning is, beauty excited<br>\
her &amp;c.: and thus the women of the Arabs used<br>\
to do when they were beautiful: or you may consider the complement of لَمَّا as suppressed; as<br>\
though he said, when we did all that, we behaved<br>\
with mutual familiarity, or the like; for the complements of لَوْ and لَمَّا and حِينَ may be suppressed, and their vagueness by reason of their<br>\
suppression is more forcible in respect of the<br>\
meaning: أَنْ تَتَقَنَّعَا means مِنْ أَنْ تَتَقَنَّعَا; for<br>\
they often suppress the preposition with أَنْ:<br>\
(Ham pp. 552-3:) [J gives two readings of this<br>\
verse, accord to one of my copies of the S: one<br>\
is with تَنَازَعَا in the place of تَقَاوَضْنَا, and أَشْرَقَتْ<br>\
in the place of أَسْفَرَتْ; which make no difference<br>\
in the meaning: but this is omitted in my other<br>\
copy: the other is as follows:]<br>\
فَلَمَّا تَوَافَقْنَا سَلَّمْتُ أَقْبَلَتْ<br>\
وُجُوهٌ زَهَاهَا الحُسْنُ أَنْ تَتَقَنَّعَا<br>\
[And when we agreed together, and I saluted,<br>\
faces advanced, which beauty excited &amp;c, or the<br>\
possessors of which beauty excited &amp;c.]. (S.)<br>\
And hence their saying, بِخَدِيعَةٍ ↓ فُلَانٌ لَا يُزْدَهَى<br>\
[Such a one will not be incited, or excited, to<br>\
briskness, &amp;c., by means of deceit, or guile]. (S.)<br>\
And الفَرَحُ ↓ ازدهاهُ, meaning اِسْتَخَفَّهُ [Joy incited<br>\
him, &amp;c.]. (MA.) [And hence, perhaps, may<br>\
be derived most of the following significations.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  زَهَا الطَّلُّ النَوْرَ The طلّ [or fine drizzling rain]<br>\
made the flowers, or blossoms, to increase in<br>\
beauty of aspect. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  زَهَا السِّرَاجَ, (K,) aor.<br>\
يزهوهُ [perhaps a mistranscription for يَزْهَاهُ], inf. n.<br>\
زَهْوٌ, (TA,) He made the سراج [or lamp, or lighted<br>\
wick,] to give a bright light. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  زَهَوْتُ الإِبِلَ<br>\
I made the camels to journey, after coming to<br>\
water, (A &#39;Obeyd, JK, S, K,) a night or more,<br>\
(A &#39;Obeyd, JK, S,) or a night or two nights. (K.)<br>\
Thus the verb in relation to camels is trans. as<br>\
well as intrans. (S.) ―<br>\
-b7-  زَهَا بِالسَّيْفُ He made a<br>\
sign with the sword by waving it, or brandishing<br>\
it. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-  زَهَا بِالعَصَا He struck with the<br>\
staff, or stick. (K.) ―<br>\
-b9-  زَهَا بِمِائَةِ رِطْلٍ He computed, or computed by conjecture, [to be of the<br>\
weight of] a hundred pounds. (K.) You say,<br>\
زَهَاهُ بِمِائَةِ رِطْلٍ meaning خرزه [a mistake for حَزَرَهُ<br>\
i. e. He computed it, &amp;c., to be of the weight of<br>\
a hundred pounds]. (TK. In the TA, زها فلان<br>\
بمائة رطل, [الشَّىْءَ or the like being omitted by<br>\
an oversight,] aor. يَزْهَاهُ [which indicates an<br>\
omission after فلان].) And زَهَوْتُ القَوْمَ I computed, or computed by conjecture, the number of<br>\
the people, or party. (JK.)<br>\
-A3-  زُهِىَ, (JK, S, K,)<br>\
like عُنِىَ; (S, K;) and زَهَا, (IDrd, S, K,) like دَعَا,<br>\
but this is rare, (K,) and was dissallowed by As<br>\
in the sense of زُهِىَ, (TA in art. نخو,) aor. يَزْهُو,<br>\
inf. n. زَهْوٌ; (IDrd, S;) and ↓ أَزْهَى; (K;) said of a<br>\
man, (JK, S,) He behaved proudly, haughtily,<br>\
or insolently; (S, K, * TA;) he was proud, vain,<br>\
and boastful; (K;) or was pleased with himself,<br>\
or self-conceited: (JK:) ازدهى [i. e. ↓ اُزْدُهِىَ], in<br>\
like manner, means تَكَبَّرَ: (Har p. 264: [but this<br>\
more properly signifies, as shown above by an<br>\
explanation of اِزْدَهَاهُ, he was incited, or excited,<br>\
to lightness, levity, or unsteadiness:]) the first of<br>\
these verbs [may be originally pass. of زَهَا in the<br>\
phrase زَهَاهُ الكِبْرُ, mentioned before, but, as J says,]<br>\
is one of a class of verbs used in the pass. form<br>\
though having the sense of the act. form: in<br>\
using it imperatively, you say, لِتُزْهَ يَا رَجُلُ [Behave thou proudly, &amp;c., O man; see art. ت];<br>\
and like this is the aor. [used as an imperative]<br>\
of every verb of which the agent is not named;<br>\
for when it is reduced to its essential import, you<br>\
thereby command something, other than the<br>\
person whom you address, to affect, or befall,<br>\
that person; and the third person of the [aor.<br>\
used as an] imperative is never without ل, as<br>\
when you say, لِيَقُمْ زَيْدٌ: (S, TA:) J also says,<br>\
(TA,) I said to an Arab of the desert, of [the<br>\
tribe of] Benoo-Suleym, What is the meaning of<br>\
زُهِىَ الرَّجُلُ? and he answered, The man was<br>\
pleased with himself, or self-conceited: I said,<br>\
Dost thou say, زَهَا as meaning اِفْتَخَرَ [He gloried,<br>\
or boasted, &amp;c.]? and he answered, As for us, we<br>\
do not say it. (S, TA.) One says also, زُهِىَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
بِكَذَا i. e. نُخِىَ [Such a one gloried, or boasted,<br>\
and magnified himself, or behaved proudly, by<br>\
reason of such a thing]; as though meaning زَهَاهُ<br>\
الإِعْجَابُ بِنَفْسِهِ [i. e. self-conceit elevated him by<br>\
reason of such a thing]. (Har p. 171.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
one says, زُهِىَ الشَّىْءُ بِعَيْنَيْكَ or لِعَيْنَيْكَ The thing<br>\
was beautiful in aspect in, or to, thine eyes. (S,<br>\
accord. to different copies. [The meaning is<br>\
there shown by what immediately precedes. In<br>\
three copies of the S, I find the verb in this<br>\
phrase thus written, زُهِىَ; and only in the PS,<br>\
زها, for زَهَا, which is the form given by Golius:<br>\
Freytag writes the phrase زَهَى الشى بعينك.])<br>\

زَهَّوَ see 1, in two places, in the former half of<br>\
the paragraph.<br>\
4<br>\
أَزْهَوَ see 1, in four places, in the first three<br>\
sentences: ―<br>\
-b2-  and again, in one place, in the<br>\
last quarter of the same paragraph.<br>\
-A2-  مَا أَزْهَاهُ<br>\
[meaning How proud, vain, boastful, or selfconceited, is he!] is from زَهَا as syn. with زُهِىَ;<br>\
not from the latter of these two verbs, because<br>\
the verb of wonder is not formed from a verb of<br>\
which the agent is not named. (S.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِزْدَهَى [originally اِزْتَهَى]: see 1, as a trans.<br>\
verb, in eight places. And اُزْدُهِىَ: see 1, in the<br>\
last quarter of the paragraph.<br>\
زَهْوٌ [is the inf. n. of زَهَا (q. v.): and also has<br>\
the significations here following. ―<br>\
-b2- ] Pride [as<br>\
implying self-elevation]: (JK, S, K:) vanity, or<br>\
vain behaviour: (K:) boasting, or glorying:<br>\
(S, K:) and wrongdoing, injustice, injuriousness,<br>\
or tyranny. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  A false, or vain, saying;<br>\
syn. بَاطِلٌ; (S, K, and Ham p. 24;) a lie, or<br>\
falsehood; (JK, S, K, and Ham * ubi suprà;)<br>\
or an exaggeration in speech. (Ham ubi suprà.)<br>\
You say, قَالَ زَهْوًا [He said a false, or vain,<br>\
saying, &amp;c.]. (Ham ubi suprà.) ―<br>\
-b4-  A beautiful<br>\
aspect. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b5-  The blossoms, or flowers, of a<br>\
plant. (Lth, K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  The brightness of a plant<br>\
(K, TA) by its becoming red or yellow; (TA;)<br>\
as also ↓ زُهُوٌّ, (K, TA,) like عُلُوٌّ, (TA,) [in the<br>\
CK كالزَّهْوِ is here put in the place of كَالزُّهُوِّ,]<br>\
and ↓ زَهَآءٌ, (K, TA,) like سَحَابٌ, as the unrestricted mention of it requires, but in some of the<br>\
copies of the K with damm [i. e. زُهَآءٌ]. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b7-  Also, [or نَبَاتٌ زَهْوٌ, as in the TK,] A plant<br>\
beautiful and bright, (K,) or fresh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b8-<br>\
And Dates beginning to ripen (بُسْرٌ) that are<br>\
becoming coloured (مُلَوِّنٌ), (so in some copies of<br>\
the S and K, and in the Mgh, or مُتَلَوِّنٌ [which<br>\
signifies the same], Har p. 416), or that have<br>\
become coloured (مُلَوَّنٌ); (so in other copies of<br>\
the S and K;) as also ↓ زُهُوٌّ, (K, TA,) like عُلُوٌّ,<br>\
thus in the handwriting of Az in the T: (TA:) [here,<br>\
again, in the CK we find كالزَّهْوِ put in the place<br>\
of كَالزُّهُوِّ: or perhaps it should be ↓ كَالزُّهْوِ; as<br>\
appears from what follows in the next sentence:]<br>\
in this sense, زَهْوٌ is an inf. n. used as a subst.<br>\
(Mgh.) One says, when redness and yellowness<br>\
appear in palm-trees, قَدْ ظَهَرَ فِيهِ الزَّهْوُ [Dates<br>\
becoming, or become, red, or yellow, have appeared in them; i. e. فِى النَّخْلِ]: and the people<br>\
of El-Hijáz say, ↓ الزُّهْوُ, with damm: (S:) [Fei<br>\
says,] the subst. from زَهَا النَّخْلُ meaning “ the<br>\
palm-trees showed redness and yellowness in<br>\
their fruit ” is الزهو [i. e. ↓ الزُّهْوُ], with damm;<br>\
and AHát says that this term is used only when<br>\
the colour of the date has become free from admixture in redness or yellowness. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b9-  You<br>\
say also ثَوْبٌ زَهْوٌ A red and beautiful garment or<br>\
piece of cloth: and ثِيَابٌ زَهْوَةٌ and ↓ زَاهِيَةٌ [red<br>\
and beautiful garments &amp;c.]. (JK.)<br>\
زُهْوٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, latter<br>\
half, in three places.<br>\
زُهَا الدُّنْيَا The ornature, finery, show, pomp, or<br>\
gaiety, of the present life or world. (K, TA.)<br>\
The former noun [when indeterminate] is [with<br>\
tenween, زُهًا,] like هُدًى. (K.)<br>\
زَهْوَةٌ A shining, glistening, or brilliancy; whatever be the colour. (TA.)<br>\
زَهَآءٌ: see زَهْوٌ, in the former half of the paragraph.<br>\
زُهَآءٌ Number, or amount. (JK, Msb.) You<br>\
say, كَمْ زُهَاؤُهُمْ How many is their number? or<br>\
how much is their amount? (Msb, TA:) or, the<br>\
computation of them? (TA.) And هُمْ زُهَآءُ مِائَةٍ<br>\
[They are as many as a hundred;] they are the<br>\
number, or amount, of a hundred; (El-Fárábee,<br>\
S, Mgh, Msb, K; *) or their number, or amount,<br>\
is a hundred: (Mgh:) and مِائَةٍ ↓ زِهَآءُ, also, with<br>\
kesr: (El-Fárábee, Msb:) but the saying of<br>\
the [common] people هُمْ زُهَآء عَلَى مِائَة is not<br>\
[correct] Arabic. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A large number: whence in a trad. respecting the time of the<br>\
resurrection, إِذَا سَمِعْتُمْ بِنَاسٍ مِنْ قِبَلِ المَشْرِقِ<br>\
أُولِى زُهَآءٍ i. e. [When ye hear of men coming<br>\
from the direction of the east,] having a large<br>\
number. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And زُهَآءُ الشَّىْءِ signifies The<br>\
شَخْص [i. e. corporeal form or figure or substance,<br>\
which one sees from a distance,] of the thing.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
زِهَآءُ مِائَةٍ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
زُهُوٌّ: see زَهْوٌ, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The redness of colour, and beauty, of garments or cloths.<br>\
(JK.)<br>\
زَاهٍ [act. part. n. of زَهَا]. ―<br>\
-b2-  إِبِلٌ زَاهِيَةٌ Camels<br>\
that will not pasture upon the [plants, or trees,<br>\
termed] حَمْضِ: (ISk, S:) pl. زَوَاهٍ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
زَاهِى اللَّوْن Bright in respect of colour. (TA.)<br>\
ثِيَابٌ زَاهِيَةٌ: see زَهْوٌ, last sentence.<br>\
أَزْهَى [meaning More, and most, proud, vain,<br>\
boastful, or self-conceited, is, like مَا أَزْهَاهُ (q. v.),<br>\
from زَهَا as syn. with زُهِىَ; not from the latter of<br>\
these two verbs]. You say أَزْهَى مِنْ غُرَابٍ [More<br>\
proud, &amp;c., than a crow]; (S, Meyd;) because<br>\
the crow, in walking, ceases not to go with a<br>\
proud, or self-conceited, gait, and to look at<br>\
itself: and مِنْ وَعِلٍ [than a mountain-goat]: and<br>\
من طَاؤُوسٍ [than a peacock]: and دِيكٍ and ذُبَابٍ<br>\

and a fox]: all these are provs. (Meyd.)<br>\
إِنْزَهْوٌ, in which each of the first two letters is<br>\
augmentative, and which is said to be the only<br>\
word of its kind except إِنْقَحْلٌ from قَحَلَ, (MF,<br>\
TA,) applied to a man, Proud, haughty, or<br>\
insolent; (Lh, K;) as also ↓ مُزْدَهًى [which more<br>\
properly means incited, or excited, to lightness,<br>\
levity, or unsteadiness]; (Har p. 264:) pl. of the<br>\
former إِنْزَهْوُونَ. (Lh, TA.) [See also what next<br>\
follows.]<br>\
