زُىَّ عَلَيْنَا, or زِىَّ, (accord. to different copies<br>\
of the S, in the TA زُىَّ,) [from زَوٌّ, originally<br>\
زُوِوَ, then زُوِىَ, and then زُىَّ or زِىَّ,] or it is زُوِىَ,<br>\
(thus in some copies of the S,) It was decreed<br>\
against us. (S.)<br>\

أَزْوَى, (K,) said of a man, (TA,) [from زَوٌّ,]<br>\
He came having with him another: (K, and T<br>\
in art. تو:) mentioned by Az and Sgh on the<br>\
authority of IAar: (TA:) opposed to أَتْوَى meaning “ he came alone; by himself. ” (T in art. تو.)<br>\
زَوٌّ A pair, or couple; two coupled together;<br>\
(S, K, TA;) [of men, and] of ships and other<br>\
things; (TA;) i. q. زَوْجٌ: (K, and T in art. تو:)<br>\
opposed to تَوٌّ meaning “ one, and no more. ” (K,<br>\
and TA in this art. and in art. تو.) You say,<br>\
جَآءَ فُلَانٌ زَوًّا, meaning Such one came with<br>\
his companion. (S.) [See also art. تو.]<br>\
-A2-  الزَّوُّ<br>\
is also the name of A ship constructed by ElMutawekkil, (K, TA,) the &#39;Abbásee; in which<br>\
he associated in drinking with the poet El-Boh-<br>\
turee. (TA.) Accord. to the S, it is the name of<br>\
a mountain in El-&#39;Irák: but Aboo-Zekereeyà EtTebreezee, and after him the author of the K,<br>\
deny this, and suppose J to have been led into<br>\
error in asserting such to be the case by the following saying of the poet above mentioned:<br>\
وَلَا جَبَلًا كَالزَّوِّ يُوقَفُ تَارَةً<br>\
وَيَنْقَادُ إِمَّا قُدْتَهُ بِزِمَامِ<br>\
[Nor have I seen a mountain like الزَّوّ, that is<br>\
made stationary at one time, and becomes led on<br>\
at another time if thou draw it along with a<br>\
leading-rope]: J, however, does not say that he<br>\
took this from the poetry of El-Bohturee. (TA.<br>\
[In the CK, in the verse above cited, اِذْ ما is put<br>\
in the place of إِمَّا.])<br>\
-A3-  [J also says that,] accord.<br>\
to As, زَوُّ المَنِيَّةِ signifies What happens of decreed<br>\
perdition or death: and زَوٌّ is also said to signify<br>\
a decree [of God]: (S, TA:) and in the M it is<br>\
said that زَوٌّ signifies perdition, or death: and زَوُّ<br>\
المَنِيَّةِ, the accidents, or calamities, of destiny or<br>\
death: but accord. to the T, As said زَوْءُ المَنِيَّةِ,<br>\
withء (TA.)<br>\
