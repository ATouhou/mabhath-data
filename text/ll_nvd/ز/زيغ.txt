He, or it, (a thing, Msb,) declined, deviated,<br>\
swerved, or turned aside, (S, O, Msb, K,) from the<br>\
right course or direction, accord. to an explanation of زَيْغٌ by Er-Rághib; and from the truth:<br>\
(TA:) and زاغ, aor. يَزُوغُ, inf. n. زَوْغٌ, is a<br>\
dial. var. thereof. (Msb, TA. *) In the Kur iii. 5,<br>\
(O,) زَيْغٌ means A doubting, and a declining, or<br>\
deviating, from the truth. (O, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say<br>\

زَيْغٌ (Msb, TA) and زُيُوغٌ, (TA,) The sun declined<br>\

in the Kur [liii. 17]: (O, TA:) or, as some say,<br>\
زَاغَتِ الأَبْصَارُ signifies the eyes turned aside from<br>\
their places; as in the case of a man in fear. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
زَيَّغْتُ فُلَانًا, inf. n. تَزْيِيغٌ, I rectified the زَيْغ<br>\
[or declining, or deviating, &amp;c.,] of such a one.<br>\
(Aboo-Sa&#39;eed, O, K. *)<br>\

ازاغهُ, (S, O, Msb, K,) عَنِ الطَّرِيقِ, (S, O,)<br>\
inf. n. إِزَاغَةٌ, (Msb,) He made him to decline,<br>\
deviate, swerve, or turn aside, (S, O, Msb, K,)<br>\
from the way. (S, O.) Hence, in the Kur [iii. 6,<br>\
accord. to the usual reading], رَبَّنَا لَا تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا,<br>\
(O, TA,) meaning O our Lord, make us not [or<br>\
make not our hearts] to decline from the right<br>\
way and course: make us not to err, or go astray.<br>\

of art. زوغ.]) ―<br>\

الزَّيْغ [app. as meaning deviation from the truth,<br>\
or the right way of belief or conduct]. ((TA.) ―<br>\

فَلَمَّا زَاغُوا أَزَاغَ اللّٰهُ قُلُوبَهُمْ, in the Kur [lxi. 5],<br>\
means, accord. to Er-Rághib, And when they<br>\
quitted the right way, God dealt with them<br>\
according to that: (TA:) or God turned their<br>\
hearts from the acceptance of the truth, and the<br>\
inclining to the right course. (Bd.)<br>\

adorned, herself, and showed, or displayed, her<br>\
finery, or ornaments, and beauties of person or<br>\
form or countenance, to men, or strangers, (AZ,<br>\
S, K,) and decked herself with apparel; like<br>\

that does not eat carrion, (O, Mgh, TA,) and is<br>\
allowed to be eaten; now called in Egypt the<br>\
غُرَاب نُوحِىّ [or Noachian crow]: (TA:) or a<br>\
غُرَاب like the pigeon, black, with a dusty colour<br>\
in its head; or, as some say, inclining to white;<br>\
that does not eat carrion: (Msb in art. زوغ:) or<br>\
a small black غُرَاب, that is eaten; also called<br>\
حَذَفٌ, of which the n. un. is with ة: (ISh, TA<br>\
in art. حذف:) [these descriptions correctly apply<br>\
to different varieties of the rook; some of which<br>\
are distinguished by more or less whiteness in the<br>\
head and other parts: in the present day, the<br>\
word is, by some, perhaps generally, erroneously<br>\
applied to the carrion-crow:] Az says, “I know<br>\
not whether it be Arabic or arabicized: ” (Msb<br>\
in art. زوغ, and TA:) the truth is, that it is a<br>\
Pers. word, [زَاغْ,] arabicized; originally applied<br>\
to crows (غِرْبَان), whether small or large; but when<br>\
arabicized, applied peculiarly to one species thereof:<br>\

men, (S, O, K, TA,) i. q. زَائِغُونَ, (S, O, TA,)<br>\
like بَاعَةٌ meaning بَائِغُونَ. (O, TA.)<br>\
