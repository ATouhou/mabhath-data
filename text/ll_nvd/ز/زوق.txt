زوّقهُ, (O, Msb, TA,) inf. n. تَزْوِيقٌ, (Msb, K,)<br>\
[seems to signify primarily He washed it over<br>\
with زَاوُوق, i. e. quicksilver; he silvered it therewith.] One says, زوّق الدَّرَاهِمَ [He washed over<br>\
the dirhems with quicksilver]; from الزَّاوُوقُ. (MA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  [Then, He gilded it with an amalgam of<br>\
quicksilver and gold: see زَاوُوقٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence,]<br>\
He decorated it, and embellished it; namely, a<br>\
thing [of any kind: and particularly he painted<br>\
it]: but IF says that زوّقهُ, meaning thus, is without foundation; that they say it is from الزَّوُوقُ<br>\
meaning الزِئْبَقُ; [as it is said to be in the K;]<br>\
but that this is [mere] assertion. (O, TA.)<br>\
[Whether properly or improperly, however,] one<br>\
says, زَوَّقَ البَيْتَ بِالزَّاوُوقِ, i. e. He decorated the<br>\
house, or chamber, [perhaps meaning the House<br>\
of God, at Mekkeh, i. e. the Kaabeh, as appears<br>\
to be probable from what here follows,] and<br>\
changed its colour and its fashion or semblance,<br>\
with زاووق, i. e. زئبق. (Har p. 107.) And it is<br>\
related in a trad. that he [Mohammad] said to<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Omar, إِذَا رَأَيْتَ قُرَيْشًا قَدْ هَدَمُوا البَيْتَ ثُمَّ بَنَوْهُ<br>\
فَزَوَّقُوهُ فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتَ المَوْتَ فَمُتْ [When thou seest<br>\
Kureysh shall have demolished the House of God,<br>\
then built it again, and decorated it, if thou be<br>\
able to die, then die]: he disliked the تَزْوِيق of<br>\
mosques because of its inducing desire for the<br>\
things of the present world, and its finery, or<br>\
because of its diverting the person praying. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  One says also, (TA,) زَوَّقْتُ الكَلَامَ, and الكِتَابَ,<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  I embellished the speech, or language, and the<br>\
writing, or book; and (tropical:)  I rectified, or corrected,<br>\
it. (S, TA.) And زَوَّرَ فُلَانٌ كِتَابَهُ and زَوَّقَهُ both<br>\
mean (tropical:)  Such a one rectified, or corrected, his<br>\
writing, or book. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And زَوَّقُوا الجَارِيَةَ<br>\
They embellished the girl, or young woman, with<br>\
نُقُوش [or decorations, app. such as are made by<br>\
tattooing, or staining with حِنَّآء]: such decoration<br>\
is termed ↓ زَوَاقٌ, like سَحَابٌ: and hence, ↓ تَزَيَّقِى,<br>\
[Embellish thyself &amp;c.,] said to a woman; [so<br>\
that it is originally ↓ تَزَوَّقِى;] or this is from زيق,<br>\
[i. e. زِيقٌ,] with ى. (TA.)<br>\
5<br>\
تَزَوَّقَ see the last sentence above, in two places.<br>\
زُوَقٌ: see زَاوُوقٌ.<br>\
زَوَقَةٌ [pl. of زَائِقٌ, act. part. n. of the unused verb<br>\
زَاقَ,] Decorators, or embellishers, of the ceilings of<br>\
houses or chambers. (AA, TA.) [See also زَوَّاقٌ.]<br>\
زَوَاقٌ: see 2, last sentence.<br>\
[<br>\
زَوَّاقٌ A decorator; an embellisher: and particularly a painter. See also زَوَقَةٌ, above.]<br>\
زَاوُوقٌ, (S, O, K, [in the CK written زاؤُقْ, as though<br>\
it were زَاؤُوقٌ, the quiescent و being indicated by the<br>\
sign of sukoon after the dammeh,]) of the dial. of<br>\
the people of El-Medeeneh, (AA, S, O,) i. q. زِئْبَقٌ<br>\
[i. e. Quicksilver]; (AA, S, O, K;) as also ↓ زُوَقٌ;<br>\
(AA, O, K;) but from what is said by IB, it<br>\
would seem that this last word is pl. of زَاوُوقٌ:<br>\
(TA:) it is used in ↓ تَزَاوِيق [meaning decorations, or embellishments, pl. of تَزْويقٌ used as a<br>\
simple subst., or of the n. un. تَزْوِيقَةٌ]; (S, O;)<br>\
and hence, [accord. to some,] التَّزْوِيقُ signifying<br>\
“ the act of decorating, and embellishing; ” (K;)<br>\
for it is put, together with gold, (S, O, K,) for<br>\
overlaying therewith, (K,) upon iron, (S, O,) and<br>\
then it is put into the fire, whereupon the زئبق<br>\
[or quicksilver] goes from it [by evaporation],<br>\
and the gold remains: (S, O, K:) and hence<br>\
anything decorated, or embellished, is termed<br>\
↓ مُزَوَّقٌ, (S, O,) though not having in it زئبق. (S.)<br>\
تَزْوِيقٌ inf. n. of 2. (Msb.) [Used as a simple<br>\
subst., this, or the n. un. تَزْوِيقَةٌ, has for its pl.<br>\
تَزَاوِيقُ:] see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
مُزَوَّقٌ Washed over with [زَاوُوق or] زِئْبَق [i. e.<br>\
quicksilver]; applied to a dirhem. (TA.) Decorated therewith (TA) [or with an amalgam of<br>\
quicksilver and gold subjected to the action of fire<br>\
so that the quicksilver is evaporated]. ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
hence, (TA,) Anything decorated, or embellished,<br>\
(S, O, Msb, K, TA,) though not having in it<br>\
زِئْبَق. (S, O.) See زَاوُوقٌ. ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, applied to<br>\
speech, or language, (assumed tropical:)  Embellished: (Kr, TA:)<br>\
and applied to a book, or writing, [in the same<br>\
sense: (see 2:) or] as meaning (tropical:)  rectified, or corrected; like مُزَوَّرٌ. (AZ, TA.)<br>\
