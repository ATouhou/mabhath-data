زَجَجْتُهُ بِالرُّمْحِ I cast at him with the spear. (A,<br>\

-A2-  زَجَّجَتْ حَاجِبَهَا, (S, A,) or زجّج<br>\
حَاجِبَهُ, (K, TA,) inf. n. تَزْجِيجٌ, (TA,) She, or<br>\
he, made her, or his, eyebrow narrow and long:<br>\
(S, K:) [or made it arched: (see 1, last sentence:)<br>\
or made it narrow and long and arched: (see<br>\
زَجَجٌ below:)] or clipped the redundant portions<br>\
of the hair thereof: or lengthened it [in appearance] with إِثْمِد [i. e. antimony, or ore of antimony, or a black collyrium; like as the ancient<br>\
Egyptians were accustomed to do, as appears<br>\
from their paintings and sculptures; and like as<br>\
some of the Arab women still do; extending a<br>\
black line towards the ear, and also a similar line<br>\
from the outer angle of the eye]. (TA.) In the<br>\
following verse of the poet Er-Rá&#39;ee,<br>\
إِذَا مَا الغَانِيَاتُ خَرَجْنَ يَوْمًا<br>\
وَزَجَّجْنَ الحَوَاجِبَ وَالعُيُونَا<br>\
[the last of these significations may be intended;<br>\
so that it may be rendered, When the females<br>\
content with their husbands, or with their beauty,<br>\
&amp;c., shall go forth (or went forth) one day, and<br>\
shall lengthen (or lengthened) with black collyrium<br>\
the eyebrows and the eyes: or] كَحَلْنَ is meant<br>\
to be understood before العُيُونَا. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
from تَزْجِيحُ الحَوَاجِبِ as signifying “ the clipping<br>\
of the redundant portions of the hair of the eyebrows,” زجّج مَوْضِعَهَا, occurring in a trad., referring to a hole made in a piece of wood in<br>\
which a thousand deenars and a writing had been<br>\
inserted, is expl. as meaning He made even, and<br>\
adjusted, the place thereof: or, accord. to IAth,<br>\
it may be that the hole was in the end of the<br>\
piece of wood, and so it may mean he made a زُجّ<br>\
[q. v.] upon the place thereof, to hold it fast, and<br>\
to preserve what was in it. (TA.)<br>\

(Msb;) and زَجَّاهُ; (TA;) He put, or made, a زُجّ<br>\
[q. v.] to the spear. (IAar, ISk, S, A, Msb, K.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  The first of these phrases is said also to signify<br>\
He removed, or took off, its زُجّ from the spear:<br>\
(A:) IAar is related to have said thus; but he is<br>\
also related to have said that this signification is<br>\
not allowable. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
اِزْدَجَّ, said of the eyebrow, It reached to the<br>\
outer extremity (ذُنَابَى) of the eye. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And,<br>\
said of herbage, Its intervening spaces became<br>\
closed up. (TA.)<br>\
زُجٌّ [The pointed iron foot, or heel, or shoe, of<br>\
a spear;] the iron at the lower extremity of a<br>\
spear; (S, A, Msb, K;) i. e. the iron which is<br>\
fixed upon the lower extremity of a spear, and<br>\
with which the spear is stuck into the ground:<br>\
the iron which is fixed upon its upper extremity,<br>\
and with which one pierces, being called سِنَانٌ:<br>\
(ISd, TA:) pl. [of mult.] زِجَاجٌ and زِجَجَةٌ (S,<br>\
Msb, K) and [of pauc.] أَزْجَاجٌ and أَزِجَّةٌ, (TA,)<br>\
or this last is not allowable, (S, Msb, TA,) accord. to ISk. (Msb.) Zuheyr says,<br>\
وَمَنْ يَعْصِ أَطْرَافَ الزِّجَاجِ فَإِنَّهُ<br>\
يُطِيعُ العَوَالِى رُكِّبَتْ كُلَّ لَهْذَمِ<br>\
[And he who refuses to yield to the points of the<br>\
iron feet of the spears shall yield to the upper<br>\
extremities thereof mounted with every sharp<br>\
spear-head]: ISk says, he means that he who<br>\
refuses to yield to a small thing will encounter a<br>\
great thing: and Khálid Ibn-Kulthoom says,<br>\
they used to meet their enemies, when they<br>\
desired peace, with the iron feet of their spears<br>\
turned towards them; and if they refused peace,<br>\
they turned their spears&#39; heads to them, and<br>\
combated them. (TA.) [By a synecdoche, the<br>\
pl.] زِجَاجٌ is also used to signify Spears, altogether. (Ham p. 147.) ―<br>\

(L:) or the part [or joint] between the lower<br>\

leaned upon his elbows: and اِتَّكَؤُوا عَلَى زِجَاجِ<br>\
مَرَافِقِهِمْ (tropical:)  [They leaned upon the extremities of<br>\
