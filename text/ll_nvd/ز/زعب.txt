spear, (A,) and spears, (A, K,) so called in relation to a certain man named Zá&#39;ib (زَاعِبٌ),<br>\
(A, K,) of El-Khazraj, who made spear-heads:<br>\
(A:) so says Mbr: (TA:) or (assumed tropical:)  the spears thus<br>\
termed are such as quiver much (عَسَّالَةٌ), which,<br>\
when shaken, have a motion like the torrent<br>\
termed زَاعِبٌ, of which one portion impels another:<br>\
the ى being that of the rel. n.; to give intensiveness to the signification, as in أَحْمَرِىٌّ: (A:) or<br>\
(tropical:) such that, when they are shaken, their كُعُوب<br>\
[i. e. knots, or joints, or their internodal portions,]<br>\
are as though they ran one into another, (K,<br>\
TA,) by reason of its pliancy: so says As: and<br>\
this meaning is tropical; for it is from the phrase<br>\
مَرَّ يَزْعَبُ بِحِمْلِهِ meaning “ he went along [impelled by his load, or] easily with his load: ”<br>\
accord. to another explanation, زاعبىّ applied to a<br>\
spear means such that, when it is shaken, the whole<br>\
of it is [in appearance] impelled in its several<br>\
parts by the impetus of one part acting upon<br>\
another, as though its hind part ran into its fore<br>\
part: (TA:) or زَاعِبِيَّةٌ signifies spears, (S, TA,)<br>\
universally. (TA.) You say also سِنَانٌ زَاعِبِىٌّ<br>\
(S, TA) A spear-head of Zá&#39;ib. (TA.)<br>\
