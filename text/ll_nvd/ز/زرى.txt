زَرَى عَلَيْهِ, (S, Msb, K,) or زَرَى عَلَيْهِ فِعْلَهُ,<br>\
(Mgh, TA,) aor. يَزْرِى, (Msb, TA,) inf. n. زِرَايَةٌ,<br>\
(S, Mgh, Msb, K, TA,) with kesr, (Msb, TA,)<br>\
but by some written with fet-h, (TA, [زَرايَة, thus<br>\
in the CK and in one of my copies of the S and<br>\
in my MS. copy of the K,]) and زَرْىٌ (Msb, K)<br>\
and زَرْيَةٌ (Msb [perhaps a mistranscription for<br>\
what next follows]) and مَزْرِيَةٌ and مَزْرَاةٌ and زُرْيَانٌ,<br>\
with damm, (K,) but accord. to the copies of the<br>\
T and M زَرَيَانٌ; (TA;) and عليه ↓ تزرّى, (S,<br>\
Msb, K,) and عليه ↓ ازرى, but this is of rare<br>\
occurrence, (K,) and ↓ اِزْدَرَاهُ; (Msb;) He blamed,<br>\
found fault with, or reproved, (Lth, AZ, S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K,) him, (S, Msb, K,) or his deed; (Mgh,<br>\
TA;) or was angry with him, with the anger that<br>\
proceeds from a friend: (S, TA:) and reproached<br>\
him, upbraided him, or blamed him angrily or<br>\
severely: (Lth, TA:) and he mocked, scoffed, or<br>\
laughed, at him; derided him; or ridiculed him.<br>\
(Msb.) ―<br>\

ازرى بِهِ, inf. n. إِزْرَآءٌ, He held it (i. e. a thing,<br>\
S, Msb, or a case, or an affair, K) in little, or<br>\
light, or mean, estimation, or in contempt; (S,<br>\
Mgh, Msb, K;) as also ↓ اِزْدَرَاهُ. (Mgh.) And<br>\
i. q. قَصَّرَ بِهِ [app. here meaning (in like manner<br>\
as it is rendered below in this paragraph) He fell<br>\
short of that estimation which was required by<br>\
him, or due to him]; and ↓ اِزْدَرَاهُ, i. e. he contemned, or despised, him; [and so, app., ↓ استزراهُ;<br>\
(see مُزْدَرٍ;)] or made him to be contemned or<br>\
despised; syn. حَقَرَهُ or حَقَّرَهُ. (S, accord. to different copies. [But whether this last explanation be<br>\
here meant to relate to ازرى به and ازدراه or to<br>\
the latter alone, is not clear.]) He lowered his<br>\
condition, or estimation. (Ham p. 117.) He<br>\
brought against him the imputation of a fault, or<br>\
vice, or the like, (&#39;Eyn, K, TA,) or a thing, or<br>\
an affair, or an action, whereby he desired to<br>\
involve him in confusion. (ISd, K, TA.) ازرى<br>\
بِعِلْمِهِ and بِهِ ↓ زَرَى, mentioned, but not explained,<br>\
by Lh, are thought by ISd to signify قَصَّرَ بِهِ [app.<br>\
meaning He fell short of that estimation which<br>\
was required by, or due to, his knowledge]. (TA.)<br>\
