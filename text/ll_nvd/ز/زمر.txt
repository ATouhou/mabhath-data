جَاؤُوا زُمَرًا They came in parties in a state of dispersion, one after another: (A:) some say that<br>\
زُمْرَةٌ is from ↓ زَمْرٌ [originally an inf. n., (see 1,<br>\
first sentence,) and hence] signifying “ sound,”<br>\
because a company of men is not without sound:<br>\
others, that it signifies a company of few persons;<br>\
from شَاةٌ زَمِرَةٌ: (MF:) but the former is the<br>\
proper derivation, and is confirmed by what is<br>\
said in the B. (TA.)<br>\
زَمُورٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
زَمِيرٌ Short; (Kr, K;) applied to a man: (TA:)<br>\

upon the reed [or مِزْمَار]. (K.)<br>\
زَمَّارٌ (As, S, A, Msb, K) and ↓ زَامِرٌ, (As, S, K,)<br>\
but the latter is rare, (K,) or scarcely ever used,<br>\

Az, S, K:) so in a trad., in which it is said<br>\
نَهَى عَنْ كَسْبِ الزَّمَّارَةِ He prohibited the gain<br>\
of the fornicatress: (Th, A&#39;Obeyd, Az, S:) so<br>\
called because she publishes her business: (Th:)<br>\
some say that the correct word is here رَمَّازَة,<br>\
because such a woman makes signs with her lips<br>\
and her eyes and her eyebrows: Az says that<br>\
he holds the former to be the right; and Abu-l-<br>\
&#39;Abbás Ahmad says that the latter is wrong, and<br>\
that the former signifies a beautiful prostitute:<br>\
but Az adds that the trad. may mean as above, or<br>\
he prohibited the gain of the female singer, as<br>\
AHát relates on the authority of As. (TA.)<br>\

used as meaning (tropical:)  A جَامِعَة; (A, TA;) [i. e.] A<br>\
[shackle for the neck and hands, such as is called]<br>\
غُلّ. (TA.) And (assumed tropical:)  A bar of iron (عَمُودٌ) between<br>\
the two rings of the [shackle called] غُلّ: (M, O,<br>\
K:) so termed because of its sound. (O.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\

K, * TA;) what is called in Persian نَاىْ [now<br>\
generally meaning a flute]; (marginal note in a<br>\
copy of the KT;) as also ↓ زَمَّارَةٌ, (K,) [which<br>\
latter, by many pronounced زُمَّارَة, and generally<br>\
so pronounced in Egypt, is applied to a double<br>\
reed-pipe, figured and described in my work on<br>\
the Modern Egyptians,] and ↓ مَزْمُورٌ and ↓ مَزْمُورٌ,<br>\
(IAth,) the latter like مَغْلُوقٌ and مَغْرُودٌ: (TA:)<br>\
pl. of the first, (S, A,) and of the last two, مَزَامِيرُ.<br>\
(S, * A.) It is related in a trad., that Mohammad,<br>\
on hearing Aboo-Moosà El-Ash&#39;aree reciting,<br>\
said to him, لَقَدْ أُعْطِيتَ مِزْمَارًا مِنْ مَزَامِيرِ آلِ دَاوُودَ<br>\
(tropical:)  [Verily thou hast been gifted with a pipe like<br>\
that of David himself]; likening the sweetness<br>\
of his voice and melody to the sound of the مِزْمَار;<br>\
(TA;) as though he had musical pipes in his<br>\
throat: or مزاميرآل داوود is here the same as<br>\
مَزْمُورَات دَاوُود: (A:) for, ―<br>\
-b2-  مَزَامِيرُ دَاوُودَ also<br>\
signifies [The Psalms of David;] what David<br>\
used to sing, or chant, (يَتَغَنَّى بِهِ, in the CK<br>\
يُتَغَنَّى به,) of the Psalms: (K:) and to such is<br>\
likened the utmost sweetness of voice in reciting:<br>\
and آل is said to be here redundant or pleonastic;<br>\
meaning the person: (TA:) or (so in the TA,<br>\
but in the K “ and ”) مزامير داوود signifies kinds<br>\
of prayer, or supplication: it is pl. of مِزْمَارٌ and<br>\
of ↓ مَزْمُورٌ or مُزْمُورٌ. (So in different copies of<br>\
the K.)<br>\
مَزْمُورٌ and مُزْمُورٌ: see مِزْمَارٌ, in two places.<br>\
مُسْتَزْمِرٌ (tropical:)  Shrinking, and abject, or ignominious,<br>\
in his own estimation. (K, TA.) [See also its<br>\
verb.]<br>\
