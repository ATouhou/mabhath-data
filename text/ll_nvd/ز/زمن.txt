زَمِنَ. aor.<br>\
زَمَنَ, inf. n. زَمَنٌ (Msb, K) and زَمَانَةٌ<br>\
(S, * Msb, K) and زُمْنَةٌ, (K,) He (a man, S, Msb)<br>\
had, or was affected with, a malady of long continuance, (Msb,) or what is termed زَمَانَةٌ, expl.<br>\
below: (K:) he was, or became, afflicted [with<br>\
what is so termed]: (S:) or he was, or became,<br>\
crippled. (TK.)<br>\
3<br>\
عَامَلَهُ مُزَامَنَةً (S, K) and زِمَانًا (Lh, TA) [He<br>\
bargained, or made an engagement, with him, to<br>\
work, for a time], (S, K,) from الزَّمَنُ. (S,) is<br>\
like مُشَاهَرَةً [and شِهَارًا] (S, K) from الشَّهْرُ. (S.)<br>\
4<br>\
ازمن [He, or it, continued a long time;] a<br>\
long time passed over him, or it, (K, * TA,) i. e.<br>\
a thing. (TA.) You say, ازمن بِالمَكَانِ He remained, staid, dwelt, or abode, a long time (زَمَانًا)<br>\
in the place. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence,] ازمن عَنِّى<br>\
عَطَاؤُهُ (tropical:)  His gift [was a long time kept back from<br>\
me, or] was slow, or tardy, in coming to me.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
-A2-  ازمن فُلَانًا He (God) made such a one<br>\
to be such as is termed زَمِن, i. e. affected with a<br>\
protracted disease; (Msb, TA;) or crippled, or<br>\
deprived of the power to move or to stand or to<br>\
walk, by disease, or by a protracted disease: or<br>\
made him to be affected with what is termed<br>\
[زَمَانَةٌ, expl. below, as meaning] عَاهَةٌ [&amp;c.].<br>\
(TA.) It is said also of a disease [as meaning It<br>\
deprived him of the power to move &amp;c.]. (TA in<br>\
art. عضب.)<br>\
زَمَنٌ an inf. n. of زَمِنَ [q. v.]. (Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And a simple subst. [meaning Continuance for a<br>\
long time,] from أَزْمَنَ in the first of the senses<br>\
assigned to it above; and so ↓ زُمْنَةٌ, with damm.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also, and ↓ زَمَانٌ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,)<br>\
the former a contraction of the latter, (Msb,) A<br>\
time, whether little or much; (S, Msb, K;) thus<br>\
accord. to Er-Rághib; (TA in art. دهر;) as being<br>\
a space capable of division: (Msb:) and so says<br>\
El-Munáwee: (TA:) a time considered with<br>\
respect to its beginning and its end: (Er-Rághib,<br>\
MF voce أَمَدٌ:) or i. q. عَصْرٌ [as meaning a space,<br>\
or period, of time]: (M, K:) [often meaning,<br>\
without any addition to qualify it, a long time;<br>\
as in an instance of the usage of the latter word<br>\
above: (see 4:) what follows here applies to each<br>\
of these words:] زَمَانٌ differs in some respects<br>\
from آنٌ and from أَمَدٌ: Sh asserts it to be syn.<br>\
with دَهْرٌ; but AHeyth says that this is a mistake:<br>\
(TA:) [it is so, however, sometimes, accord. to<br>\
several authorities, as has been shown in art. دهر;<br>\
and particularly as meaning fortune, or fate:]<br>\
IAth says that it is applied to the whole of what<br>\
is termed الدَّهْرُ [as meaning time], and to a<br>\
portion thereof: AHeyth says that it is the زمان<br>\
[i. e. season] of fruit, of ripe dates, and of heat<br>\
and cold: and that it may be [a period of] two<br>\
months [as meaning any one of the six seasons of<br>\
the solar year] to six months [as meaning the<br>\
half-year often termed summer and the half-year<br>\
often termed winter]: (TA:) [thus] it is applied<br>\
to any one of the four quarters of the year;<br>\
(Msb, TA;) the first of which [in the order in<br>\
which they are commonly mentioned by the<br>\
Arabs, i. e. autumn,] is called by the Arabs [of<br>\
the classical age] الرَّبِيعُ, but vulgarly الخَرِيفُ;<br>\
called by the former name because the first rain<br>\
is therein, giving growth to [the herbage called]<br>\
the رَبِيع; and called by the latter name because<br>\
the fruits are gathered therein; and it commences<br>\
when the sun enters Libra: the second [i. e.<br>\
winter] is called الشِّتَآءُ; and commences when the<br>\
sun enters Capricornus: the third [i. e. spring] is<br>\
الصَّيْفُ, vulgarly called الرَّبِيعُ; and commences<br>\
when the sun enters Aries: the fourth [i. e.<br>\
summer] is القَيْظُ, vulgarly called الصَّيْفُ; and<br>\
commences when the sun enters Cancer: (Msb:) *<br>\
* The two following tables exhibit the principal<br>\
divisions of the Arabian Calendar. The latter of<br>\
them shows the places of the months in relation<br>\

it is also applied to the time, or period, of the<br>\
reign, rule, prefecture, or the like, of a man:<br>\
[and to the life-time of a man:] with the philosophers, it signifies the measure of the motion of<br>\
the ninth (or greatest) sphere (الفَلَك الأَطْلَس):<br>\
(TA:) [and there are various other explanations<br>\
belonging to the conventional language of the<br>\
schools, not to the proper language of the Arabs:<br>\
(see the “ Dict. of the Technical Terms used in the<br>\
Sciences of the Musalmans: ”)] the pl. (of زَمَنٌ,<br>\
Msb) is أَزْمَانٌ and أَزْمُنٌ and (that of زَمَانٌ, Msb)<br>\
أَزْمِنَةٌ. (S, Msb, K.) [The dim. of زَمَنٌ, i. e. زُمَيْنٌ,<br>\
see below.] In the following trad., إِذَا تَقَارَبَ<br>\
لَمْ تَكَدْ رُؤيَا المُؤْمِنِ تَكْذِبُ ↓ الزَّمَانُ [When the time<br>\
becomes contracted, the dream of the believer will<br>\
scarcely ever, or never, be false], what is meant<br>\
is the end of time; and the approach of the resurrection; because when a thing becomes little,<br>\
its extremities contract: or what is meant is the<br>\
day&#39;s and the night&#39;s becoming equal; for the<br>\
interpreters of dreams assert that the times [of<br>\
dreams] most true of interpretation are the season<br>\
of the breaking forth of the blossoms and that of<br>\
the ripening of the fruit, which is when the day<br>\
and the night become equal: or what is meant is<br>\
the coming forth of El-Mahdee, when the year<br>\
will be like the month, and the month like the<br>\
week, and the week like the day, and the day<br>\
like the hour, deemed short because deemed<br>\
delightful: (K in art. قرب:) or it alludes to the<br>\
shortness of lives and the scantiness of blessings.<br>\
(TA in that art.) In another trad. it is said,<br>\
كَانَتْ تَأْتِينَا أَزْمَانَ خَدِيجَةَ, meaning [She used to<br>\
come to us] in the life-time [lit. times] of Khadeejeh. (TA.) And one says also, مَا لَقِيتُهُ مُذْ<br>\
↓ زَمَنَةٍ, meaning ↓ مذ زَمَانٍ [i. e. I have not met<br>\
him for a long time past: but in this case, accord.<br>\
to the more approved usage, one should say مُذْ<br>\
زَمَنَةٌ and مُذْ زَمَانٌ, or مُنْذُ زَمَنَةٍ and مُنْذُ زَمَانٍ].<br>\
(Lh, K, * TA.)<br>\
(For authorities, and further information, see the<br>\
words here mentioned, and more particularly نَوْءٌ<br>\
and رَبِيعٌ; under the latter of which it is said that<br>\
the third and last of the Six Seasons are called by<br>\
some, respectively, الرَّبِيعُ الثَّانِى and الرَّبِيعُ الأَوَّلُ;<br>\
and also that the appellations of the 3rd and 4th<br>\
months are differently pronounced by different<br>\
persons; and that some exclude the وَسْمِىّ from<br>\
the rains called الرَّبِيعُ: and for the Calendar of<br>\
the Mansions of the Moon, see مَنَازِلُ القَمَرِ, in<br>\
art. نزل.) The months are said to have received<br>\
the names here given to them from Kiláb Ibn-Murrah, an ancestor of Mohammad, about two<br>\
centuries before El-Islám. These months were<br>\
lunar; and from this period, with the view of<br>\
adapting their year to the solar, the Arabs added<br>\
a month, which they called النَّسِىْءُ, at the end of<br>\
every three years, until they were forbidden to do<br>\
so by the Kur-án (ch. ix.): but the months still<br>\
retrograded through the seasons, though much<br>\
more slowly. The abolition of the intercalation<br>\
was proclaimed by Mohammad at the pilgrimage<br>\
in the tenth year of the Flight.<br>\
زَمِنٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ زَمِينٌ, (K, TA,)<br>\
applied to a man, (S, Msb, TA,) Having, or<br>\
affected with, a malady of long continuance;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb, TA; *) as also ↓ مُزْمَنٌ; (Har p. 182;)<br>\
or crippled, or deprived of the power to move or<br>\
to stand or to walk, by disease, or by a protracted<br>\
disease: (TA:) or having what is termed زَمَانَةٌ<br>\
[expl. below], i. e. عَاهَةٌ: (K, TA:) or afflicted<br>\
[with what is so termed]: (S:) pl. زَمِنُونَ, (K,<br>\
TA,) of the former, (TA,) and زَمْنَى, (Msb, K,<br>\
TA,) [likewise] of the former, (Msb,) or of the<br>\
latter, as also زَمَنَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] هُوَ فَاتِرُ<br>\

briskness or promptness, powerless in respect of<br>\
desire]. (TA.)<br>\
زُمْنَةٌ: see زَمَنٌ, second sentence.<br>\
زَمَنَةٌ A space, or period, or a long space or<br>\
period, of time. (TA.) See also زَمَنٌ, last sentence.<br>\
زَمَانٌ: see زَمَنٌ, third sentence, and again in<br>\
two places in the latter part of the paragraph.<br>\
زَمِينٌ: see زَمِنٌ.<br>\
زُمَيْنٌ [dim. of زَمَنٌ]. You say, لَقِيتُهُ ذَاتَ الزُّمَيْنِ,<br>\
meaning thereby تَرَاخِى الوَقْتِ; (S, K;) [i. e.<br>\
I met him some time ago;] like as one says<br>\
ذَاتَ العُوَيْمِ, meaning بَيْنَ الأَعْوَامِ: (S:) or meaning فِى سَاعَةٍ لَهَا أَعْدَادٌ [in a time consisting of<br>\
some, or several, subdivisions]: (TA:) or ذَاتَ<br>\
الزُّمَيْنِ means مُذْ ثَلَاثَةٌ أَزْمَانٍ [three seasons ago;<br>\
or, app., three or more, to ten; (agreeably with<br>\
an explanation of ذَاتَ العُوَيْمِ voce ذُو;) by ازمان<br>\
being app. meant periods of two, or three, or six,<br>\
months]; (T in art. ذُو;) and the like is said by<br>\
IAar. (TA in art. صبح.)<br>\
زَمَانَةٌ an inf. n. of زَمِنَ [q. v.]. (S, * Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
[Used as a simple subst.] it signifies also A<br>\
disease, or an evil affection, syn. آفَةٌ, (S,) or عَاهَةٌ,<br>\
(K,) in animals: (S:) [and particularly, in a<br>\
man, a disease of long continuance: or such as<br>\
cripples, or deprives of the power to move or to<br>\
stand or to walk: (see زَمِنَ and زَمِنٌ:)] or want<br>\
of some one or more of the limbs, or members;<br>\
and privation of the powers, or faculties. (Har<br>\

سَاعَةٌ زَمَانِيَّةٌ A while; an indefinite short time;<br>\

مُزْمَنٌ: see زَمِنٌ.<br>\
مُزْمِنٌ Of long continuance; of long standing;<br>\
over which a long time has past. (TA.) [You<br>\
