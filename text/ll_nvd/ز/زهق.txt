مَتْلَفَة [app. meaning a desert in which people<br>\
perish] as meaning far-extending. (Ham p. 23.)<br>\

(S, K:) or marrowy, but not fat in the utmost<br>\

say, (JK,) very lean; (JK, K, TA;) Such that a<br>\

meanings. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And, applied to marrow,<br>\
Compact and full: (S, TA:) or, so applied,<br>\
good in respect of fatness: and some say, i. q.<br>\

وَلَا ضِعَافٍ مُخُّهُنَّ زَاهِقُ<br>\

being what is termed مُكْفَأ, [by which is here<br>\
meant having one rhyme made to end with<br>\
kesreh (which is substituted for fet-hah by poetic<br>\
license) and another with dammeh,] the poet<br>\

twisted, of the fur of she-camels, that were not<br>\
aged ones, nor such as had their teeth fallen out<br>\
by reason of extreme age, nor weak,] but whose<br>\
marrow was compact and full: [or, agreeably<br>\
with an explanation given above from the JK,<br>\
زاهق may mean in a melting state, &amp;c.:] another<br>\
explanation is, that زاهق here means ذَاهِب [going<br>\
away]: (S, TA:) but, as Sgh says, the [right]<br>\
reading is<br>\
عِيسٍ عِتَاقٍ ذَاتِ مُخٍّ زَاهِقِ<br>\

white hue, of generous race, having compact and<br>\
