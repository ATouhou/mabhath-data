زَوَاهُ, (K,) aor. يَزْوِيهِ, (TA,) inf. n. زَىٌّ and<br>\
زُوِىٌّ, (K, TA,) the latter [accord. to the CK<br>\
زَوْىٌ, but it is correctly] like عُتِىٌّ, (TA,) He put<br>\
it aside, or away, or apart; or removed it from<br>\
its place. (K.) You say, زَوَىَ عَنْهُ كَذَا, inf. n.<br>\
زُوِىٌّ, He averted, diverted, or removed, from<br>\
him such a thing; turned, put, or sent, it away,<br>\
or back, from him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And زَوَى سِرَّهُ عَنْهُ<br>\
He concealed his secret from him. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
(K) زَوَاهُ, (S, Msb, K,) aor. as above, inf. n. زَىٌّ,<br>\
(Msb, TA,) He drew it, collected it, or gathered<br>\
it, together; contracted it, or grasped it. (S,<br>\
Msb, K.) It is said in a trad., زُوِيَتْ لِىَ الأَرْضُ<br>\
فَأْرِيتُ مَشَارِقَهَا وَمَغَارِبَهَا [The earth was collected<br>\
together to me, and I was shown its eastern parts<br>\
and its western parts]. (S, TA.) And you say,<br>\
زَوَى المَالَ, (S, Msb,) inf. n. زَىٌّ, (S,) He drew,<br>\
or collected, together, or he grasped, the property,<br>\
(Msb,) عَنْ وَارِثِهِ [from its inheritor]. (S.) And<br>\
زَوَى مَا بَيْنَ عَيْنَيْهِ (S, TA) He (a man, S) drew<br>\
together, or contracted, the part between his eyes.<br>\
(TA.) And جَآءَنَا بِصَرْبَةٍ تَزْوِى الوَجْهَ [He brought<br>\
us some very sour milk such as contracts the<br>\
face, or makes it to wrinkle]. (S in art. صرب.)<br>\
And تَزْوِى الوُجُوهَ said of a cold north wind, It<br>\
contracts [or wrinkles] the faces: a phrase used<br>\
by Tarafeh Ibn-El-&#39;Abd. (Ham p. 632.)<br>\
2<br>\
زوّى, inf. n. تَزْوِيَةٌ: see 5.<br>\
-A2-  زَيَّيْتُهُ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) which by rule should be زَوَّيْتُهُ, (S, Msb,) but<br>\
is made to accord with زِىٌّ in order to facilitate<br>\
the pronunciation, (Msb,) inf. n. accord. to the K<br>\
تَزْيِيَةٌ, but correctly, as Lth says, تَزِيَّةٌ, in measure<br>\
like تَحِيَّةٌ, (TA,) I invested him with, or made<br>\
him to have, a زِىّ [i. e. garb, guise, &amp;c.]; (S, *<br>\
Msb, K, * TA;) by means of, or with, such a<br>\
thing: you say, زَيَّيْتُهُ بِكَذَا [which may be rendered I invested, decked, or adorned, him with<br>\
such a thing; agreeably with what follows].<br>\
(Msb.) Accord. to Fr, they say, زَيَّيْتُ الجَارِيَةَ,<br>\
meaning I invested the girl, or young woman,<br>\
with a garb, or guise, &amp;c.; and decked, or adorned,<br>\
her. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  You say also, زوّى الكَلَامَ, meaning He prepared the speech in his mind; like<br>\
زَوَّرَهُ. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  زَيَّيْتُ زَايًا and زَوَّيْتُ زَايًا [mean<br>\
I wrote, or uttered, a ز]: some [hold the ا in<br>\
زاى to be originally ى, and therefore] say زَيَّيْتُ:<br>\
others [hold it to be originally و, and therefore]<br>\
say زَوَّيْتُ. (IB, on the letter أَلِف.) Zeyd Ibn-Thábit said, in relation to the expression in the<br>\
Kur [ii. 261] نُنْشِزُهَا, [accord. to one reading, or<br>\
reciting,] هِىَ زَاىٌ فَزَيِّهَا, meaning [It is زاى, therefore make thou it زاى in thy reading, or reciting;<br>\
or] read thou it, or recite thou it, with the<br>\
زاى. (S.)<br>\
4<br>\
ازوى: see art. زو.<br>\
5<br>\
تزوّى He was, or became, [or placed himself,] in a زَاوِيَة, i. e. corner, of a house or<br>\
chamber; as also ↓ زوّى, (K,) inf. n. تَزْوِيَةٌ;<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ انزوى. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  تَزَيَّا, from الزِّىُّ;<br>\
(K, KL;) or تَزَيَّا بِزِىٍّ; (Lth, MA;) He invested<br>\
himself with a garb, guise, or dress; [or with an<br>\
external appearance;] (MA, KL;) he decked, or<br>\
adorned, himself. (MA.) You say of a man,<br>\
تزيّا بِزِىٍّ حَسَنٍ [He invested himself with a beautiful, or goodly, garb, &amp;c.]. (Lth, TA.) Hence<br>\
the saying of El-Mutanebbee,<br>\
وَقَدْ يَتَزَيَّا بِالهَوَى غَيْرُ أَهْلِهِ<br>\
وَيَسْتَصْحِبُ الإِنْسَانُ مَنْ لَا يُلَائِمُهْ<br>\
(TA:) i. e. [And verily, or sometimes, or often,<br>\
one who is not entitled to it] assumes the guise of<br>\
love; and the man asks to be his companion him<br>\
who is not suited to him: (W p. 374:) his disciple Ibn-Jinnee, however, objected to him his<br>\
saying يتزيّا, and expressed his opinion that the<br>\
correct word is يَتَزَوَّى; and El-Mutanebbee admitted that he did not know the former word in<br>\
any [classical] poetry, nor in any lexicological<br>\
book, but asserted the verb in use to be only<br>\
تَزَيَّا: (MF, TA:) in the M it is said that IJ<br>\
held تَزَيَّا to be originally تَزَوْيَا, and the و to be<br>\
changed into ى because quiescent, and incorporated into the ى preceded by it. (TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انزوى It was, or became, put aside, or away,<br>\
or apart; or removed from its place. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
اِنْزَوَتِ الجِلْدَةُ فِىالنَّارِ The piece of skin became<br>\
contracted, or shrivelled, or shrunk, in the fire.<br>\
(S.) And انزوى مَا بَيْنَ عَيْنَيْهِ The part between<br>\
his eyes became drawn together, or contracted.<br>\
(TA.) And انزوى القَوْمُ بَعْضُهُمْ إِلَى بَعْضٍ The<br>\
people, or party, drew together, one portion of<br>\
them to another portion. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 5,<br>\
first sentence.<br>\
زَا and زًا and زَآءٌ and see زَاىٌ, below.<br>\
زَىْ and زَىٌّ: see زَاىٌ, below.<br>\
زِىٌّ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) originally زِوْىٌ, (S,<br>\
Msb,) Garb, guise, dress, habit, fashion of dress,<br>\
and aspect, or outward appearance; syn. لِبَاسٌ,<br>\
(S, TA,) and هَيْئَةٌ, (Fr, Msb, K, TA,) and مَنْظَرٌ:<br>\
(Fr, TA:) pl. أَزْيَآءٌ. (K.) [In the Kur xix. 75,]<br>\
some read أَحْسَنُ أَثَاثًا وَزِيًّا [Better in respect of<br>\
household-goods and in respect of garb, &amp;c.]:<br>\
others read رِيًّا, with ر: (TA:) and رِئْيًا: and<br>\
رِيْئًا: and رِيًا. (Bd.)<br>\
زَاىٌ, (Kr, S, K, &amp;c.,) in which the ا, accord. to<br>\
Lth, is originally ى, but accord. to Sb and IJ<br>\
it is و, (TA,) A certain letter (i. e. ز); (S, TA;)<br>\
[in spelling, pronounced زَاىْ; and] also called<br>\
↓ زَآءٌ, (Kr, S, K,) and ↓ زًا, and [in spelling (see<br>\
the first sentence of art. ب)] ↓ زَا, (Kr, K, but<br>\
omitted in some copies of the K,) this last being<br>\
indecl., (Kr, TA,) and ↓ زَىٌّ (K) and [in spelling]<br>\
↓ زَىْ: (Kr, K:) of all which, the first is that<br>\
which is held in [most] repute: (TA:) and this<br>\
and زَآءٌ may be meant by J&#39;s saying, الزَّاىُ حَرْفٌ<br>\
يُمَدُّ وَيُقْصَرُ وَلَا يُكْتَبُ إِلَّا بِيَآءٍ بَعْدَ الأَلِفِ; though<br>\
the author of the K asserts J to have erred in<br>\
saying this: (MF, TA:) the pl. is أَزْوَآءٌ and أَزْيَآءٌ,<br>\
(Kudot;,) the former or the latter accord. to different<br>\
opinions, (TA,) and أَزْوٍ and أَزْىٍ, (K,) each [originally] of the measure أَفْعُلٌ. (TA.) One says,<br>\
هٰذِهِ زَاىٌ حَسَنَةٌ [This is a beautiful; ز]: and كَتَبْتُ<br>\
زَايًا صَغِيرَةً [I wrote a small; ز]: and the like. (IJ,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  زَاىْ is also said by the vulgar on an<br>\
occasion of wonder, and of disapproval: but [SM<br>\
says,] I know not what is its origin. (TA.) [It<br>\
may be from the Pers. زَىْ, or زِهِى; which are<br>\
likewise said on an occasion of wonder. إِزَّاىْ and<br>\
إِزَّىّ and إِزَّىْ, and with أَ in the place of إِ, are also<br>\
said by the vulgar in Egypt on an occasion of<br>\
wonder, and of denial, meaning How? And زَىْ<br>\
is used by them for the prefix كَ, meaning Like.]<br>\
زُوَيَّةٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
زُيَيَّةٌ dim. of زَاىٌّ [accord. to those who hold<br>\
the ا in the latter to be originally ى, or ↓ زُوَيَّةٌ<br>\
accord. to those who hold that letter to be originally و; like أُيَيَّةٌ and أُوَيَّةٌ as dims. of آءٌ accord.<br>\
to different opinions: see art. ا, in the middle of<br>\
the first column]. (TA.)<br>\
زَاوِيَةٌ A corner, or an angle, (رُكْن,) of a house<br>\
or room or the like: (K:) of the measure فَاعِلَةٌ<br>\
from زَوَى signifying جَمَعَ; because of its em-<br>\
bracing (لِأَنَّهَا جَمَعَتْ) a part, or portion, (قُطْرًا,)<br>\
thereof: (Msb, TA:) pl. زَوَايَا [which is irreg.;<br>\
for by rule it should be زَوَآءٍ, being originally of<br>\
the measure فَوَاعِلُ, not فَعَائِلُ]. (S, K.) They<br>\
say, كَمْ فِى الزَّوَايَا مِنَ الخَبَايَا [How many hidden<br>\
things are there in the corners!]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [In<br>\
geometry, An angle. ―<br>\
-b3-  And hence, زَاوِيَةُ العَوَّآءِ<br>\
The star<br>\
γ of Virgo; العَوَّآءُ being composed of<br>\
four stars,<br>\
γ,δ,ε and<br>\
η of Virgo, disposed nearly<br>\
in the form of a capital L, with ε, δ, γ from top to bottom and η to the right. ] ―<br>\
-b4-  In a saying<br>\
cited voce رَاوِيَةٌ, the pl. زَوَايَا is used as meaning<br>\
Houses, or tents. (T in art. روى.) ―<br>\
-b5-  [And in the<br>\
present day, the term زَاوِيَةٌ is also applied to A<br>\
small mosque, or chapel: and in some instances,<br>\
a building of this kind, thus called, serves as a<br>\
hospice, or an asylum for poor Muslims, students<br>\
and others; like رِبَاطٌ.]<br>\
