اِزْلَغَبَّ, said of a young bird, Its feathers<br>\
came forth: (S in art. زغب, and K:) or its<br>\
feathers began to come forth, (Lth, TA,) before<br>\
their becoming black. (TA.) Also said of plumage, It began to come forth. (Lth, TA.) And<br>\
said of hair, (S in art. زغب, and K,) as also<br>\
ازلعبّ, (TA,) It grew forth after having been<br>\
shaven: (S, K:) it began to grow forth, soft:<br>\
and said of the hair of an old man, i. q. اِزْغَابَّ [it<br>\
was, or became, downy]. (TA.) Accord. to the<br>\
S, and AHei and IKtt and others, it belongs to<br>\
art. زغب, like as اِزْلَعَبَّ is held by them to belong<br>\
to art. زعب; but accord. to the K, the ل is radical,<br>\
and therefore this is its proper place. (TA.)<br>\
