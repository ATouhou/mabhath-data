زَلِقَ, aor.<br>\
زَلَقَ, (K,) inf. n. زَلَقٌ; (TA;) and<br>\
زَلَقَ, aor.<br>\
زَلُقَ, (K,) inf. n. زَلْقٌ; (TA;) He slipped;<br>\
syn. زَلَّ; (K, TA;) for which ذَلَّ is erroneously<br>\
put in [some of] the copies of the K. (TA. [See<br>\
also 5.]) And زَلِقَتْ رِجْلُهُ, (S,) or القَدَمُ, (Msb,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
زَلَقَ, inf. n. زَلَقٌ, (S, Msb,) His foot, (S,) or<br>\
the foot, (Msb,) slipped, (S,) or did not remain<br>\
firm, or fixed, in its place. (Msb.) The former<br>\
is also said of an arrow, [app. as meaning It slid<br>\
along the ground,] like زَهِقَ [q. v.]. (JK in art.<br>\
زهق.) ―<br>\
-b2-  زَلِقَ بِمَكَانِهِ and زَلَقَ, He was, or became,<br>\
disgusted by, or with, his place, or he loathed it,<br>\
and removed, withdrew, or retired to a distance,<br>\
from it. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  زَلَقَتْ, said of a she-camel,<br>\
She was, or became, quick, or swift. (O, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  زَلَقَهُ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  زَلَقَهُ عَنْ مَكَانِهِ, aor.<br>\
زَلِقَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. زَلْقٌ, (TA,) He removed him from his<br>\
place. (K, TA.) Hence the reading of Aboo-Jaafar and Náfi&#39;, [in the Kur lxviii. 51,] وَإِنْ<br>\
يَكَادُ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَيَزْلِقُونَكَ بِأَبْصَارِهِمْ, meaning<br>\
[And verily they who have disbelieved almost]<br>\
smite thee with their evil eyes so as to remove<br>\
thee from thy station in which God has placed<br>\
thee, by reason of enmity to thee. (TA. [Or<br>\
this reading may be rendered agreeably with the<br>\
common reading: see 4.]) ―<br>\
-b3-  زَلَقَ رَأْسَهُ, (S, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
زَلِقَ, inf. n. زَلْقٌ, (S,) He shaved his head; as<br>\
also ↓ ازلقهُ; and ↓ زلّقهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَزْلِيقٌ: (S:)<br>\
IB says that, accord. to &#39;Alee Ibn-Hamzeh, it is<br>\
only زَبَقَهُ, with ب; and that الزَّبْقُ means the<br>\
plucking out; not the shaving: but accord. to<br>\
Fr, one says of him who has shaved his head قد<br>\
زلقه, [whether with or without teshdeed is not<br>\
shown,] and ازلقه. (TA.)<br>\
2<br>\
زلّق, [inf. n. تَزْلِيقٌ,] He made a place slippery, (K, TA,) so that it became like the مَزْلَقَة;<br>\
and thus too though there be no water therein.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Accord. to the O and K, [the inf. n.]<br>\
تَزْلِيقٌ also signifies The anointing the body with<br>\
oils and the like, so that it becomes like the مَزْلَقَة;<br>\
to which is added in the O, and though it be<br>\
without water: but this is a confusion of two<br>\
meanings; one of which is the first expl. above in<br>\
this paragraph; and the other is, the anointing<br>\
the body with oils and the like; as in the L and<br>\
the Tekmileh. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 4. ―<br>\
-b4-  And see<br>\
1, last sentence. ―<br>\
-b5-  زلّق الحَدِيدَةَ He made the<br>\
iron thing to be always sharp. (K.) ―<br>\
-b6-  رلّقهُ بِبَصَرِهِ,<br>\

at him, or it. (Ez-Zejjájee, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  See also 2,<br>\
last sentence, in art. دلص.<br>\
4<br>\
ازلقهُ He made him to slip; as also ↓ زَلَقَهُ.<br>\
(K.) All the readers except those of El-Medeeneh read, [in the Kur lxviii. 51,] وَإِنْ يَكَادُ<br>\
الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَيُزْلِقُونَكَ بِأَبْصَارِهِمْ, meaning [And<br>\
verily those who have disbelieved] almost make<br>\
thee to fall by their looking hard at thee, with<br>\
vehement hatred: so accord. to El-&#39;Otbee: or the<br>\
meaning is, (assumed tropical:)  [almost] smite thee with their [evil]<br>\
eyes: (TA:) [it is also said that] ازلق فُلَانًا بِبَصَرِهِ<br>\
means (tropical:)  he looked at such a one with the look of a<br>\
person affected with displeasure, or anger: (K:)<br>\
or so نَظَرَ إِلَى فُلَانٍ فَأَزْلَقَهُ بِبَصَرِهِ: (Jm, TA:) and<br>\
in this sense, also, is expl. the saying in the Kur<br>\
mentioned above. (TA.) One says also ازلق<br>\
رِجْلَهُ, (S,) or القَدَمَ, (Msb,) He made his<br>\
(another&#39;s) foot to slip, (S,) or he made the foot<br>\
not to remain firm, or fixed, in its place; and so<br>\
↓ زَلَّقَهَا. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ازلقت, said of a camel, (S, K,<br>\
TA,) and of a mare, (TA,) She cast her young<br>\
one; syn. أَسْقَطَتْ; (S, TA;) or أَجْهَضَتْ [q. v.]:<br>\
(K:) or she (a mare) cast forth her young one<br>\
completely formed: or, as some say, [her fœtus]<br>\
not completely formed: (JK:) and you say also,<br>\
ازلقت بِجَنِينِهَا, like أَمْلَصَتْ به [q. v.]: (Abu-l-<br>\
&#39;Abbás, TA in art. ملص:) or ازلقت وَلَدَهَا is said<br>\
of a female [of any kind], and means she cast<br>\
forth her young one before it was completely<br>\
formed. (Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also 1, last sentence.<br>\
5<br>\
تزلّق He, or it, slipped, or slid, along;<br>\
(KL;) like تزلّج. (S and TA in art. زلج. [See<br>\
also 1.]) One says, تزلّقت الغُدَّةُ بَيْنَ الجِلْدِ وَاللَّحْمِ<br>\
[The ganglion slipped about between the skin and<br>\
the flesh]. (M in art. ديص.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Also It was, or<br>\
became, smooth, or slippery: a signification indicated in the M, in art. ملس, where it is coupled<br>\
with اِسْتَوَى.] ―<br>\
-b3-  He anointed his body with oils<br>\
and the like. (JK.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He ornamented, or<br>\
adorned, himself; (Aboo-Turáb, K, TA;) as also<br>\
تزبّق: (Aboo-Turáb, TA:) and led an easy, and a<br>\
soft, or delicate, life, so that his colour, and the<br>\
exterior of his skin, had a shining, or glistening.<br>\

زَلْقٌ: see the next paragraph.<br>\
مَكَانٌ زَلَقٌ, (S,) or زَلَقٌ [alone], (K,) which is<br>\
originally an inf. n., (S,) and ↓ زَلِقٌ and ↓ زَلْقٌ (K)<br>\
and ↓ زَلَاقَةٌ and ↓ مَزْلَقٌ and ↓ مَزْلَقَةٌ, (S, K, TA,<br>\
[the last two erroneously written in the CK<br>\
مِزْلَق and مِزْلَقَة,]) all signify the same; (K;) A<br>\
slippery place; a place on which the foot does not<br>\
remain firm, or fixed. (S, TA.) Hence, in the<br>\
Kur [xviii. 38], فَتُصْبِحَ صَعِيدًا زَلَقًا, i. e., [So that<br>\
it shall become] smooth ground, with nothing in<br>\
it, or with no plants in it: or, accord. to Akh,<br>\
such that the feet shall not stand firmly upon it.<br>\

Ibn-Besheer, (Ham p. 551,)<br>\
قَدِّرْ لِرِجْلِكَ قَبْلَ الخَطْوِ مَوْقِعَهَا<br>\
فَمَنْ عَلَا زَلَقًا عَنْ غِرَّةٍ زَلَجَا<br>\
[Appoint for thy foot, before the stepping, its<br>\
place upon which it shall fall, or, as in the Ham<br>\
p. 522, simply its place, (مَوْضِعَهَا,)] for he who<br>\
goes upon a slippery place, in consequence of<br>\
inadvertence, slips]. (TA.) ―<br>\
