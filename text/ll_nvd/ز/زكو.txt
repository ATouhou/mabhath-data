زَكَا, aor. يَزْكُو, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) inf. n.<br>\
زَكَآءٌ, (S,) or زُكُوٌّ, (Msb, [accord. to which the<br>\
former seems to be a simple subst.,]) or both,<br>\
(K, TA,) the latter like عُلُوٌّ, as in the M, but<br>\
accord. to [some of] the copies of the K زَكْوٌ,<br>\
(TA,) It increased, or augmented; (S, Msb, K,<br>\
TA;) it received increase and blessing from God;<br>\
it throve by the blessing of God; (Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA;) and produced fruit; (TA in art. زكى;)<br>\
and زَكِىَ, (K in that art.,) aor. يَزْكَى, inf. n.<br>\
زَكَاةٌ, (TA in that art.,) signifies the same, (K, TA,)<br>\
mentioned by ISd, on the authority of Lh, as a dial.<br>\
var. of زَكَا, aor. يزكو; (TA;) and so ↓ ازكى;<br>\
(Msb, K;) and ↓ تزكّى: (K in art. زكى:) it is said<br>\
of seed-produce, (S, Msb, Er-Rághib, TA,) and of<br>\
wealth, or cattle &amp;c., and of other things: of anything that increases, or augments, one says يَزْكُو,<br>\
inf. n. زَكَآءٌ. (TA.) [This is the primary meaning: or, accord. to some, the primary meaning is,<br>\
It was, or became, pure:] some say that the root<br>\
denotes purity: and some, that it denotes a state<br>\
of increase, or augmentation. (Mgh.) You say<br>\
also زَكَتِ الأَرْضُ The land throve, or yielded<br>\
increase. (Msb.) And زَكَا الغُلَامُ [The boy grew,<br>\
or throve], inf. n. زُكُوٌّ and زَكَآءٌ, on the authority<br>\
of Akh. (S.) And زَكَا عَمَلُهُ (assumed tropical:)  [His deed, or<br>\
work, throve]. (K in art. در.) It is said in a<br>\
trad. of &#39;Alee, المَالُ تَنْقُصُهُ النَّفَقَةُ وَالعِلْمُ يَزْكُو عَلَى<br>\
الإِنْفَاقِ (assumed tropical:)  [Wealth, what one expends diminishes it,<br>\
but knowledge increases by expending]: زَكَآء being<br>\
thus predicated of knowledge, though this is not a<br>\
corporeal thing. (TA.) Accord. to El-Umawee,<br>\
(S,) said of a man, زَكَا, (S, K,) aor. يَزْكُو, inf. n.<br>\
زُكُوٌّ, (S,) means He enjoyed, or led, a plentiful,<br>\
and a pleasant or an easy, and a soft or delicate,<br>\
life; (S, K;) was in a state of abundance of the<br>\
goods, conveniences, or comforts, of life. (S.)<br>\
And likewise said of a man, (having the same<br>\
aor. and inf. n., TA,) it means also He was, or<br>\
became, good, or righteous; (Jel in xxiv. 21,<br>\
Msb, K, TA;) and pure from sin. (Jel ibid.)<br>\
[Hence,] هٰذَا الأَمْرُ لَا يَزْكُو بِفُلَانٍ means This<br>\
thing, or affair, will not be suitable to such a<br>\
one; will not befit him. (S.)<br>\
2<br>\
زكّاهُ, inf. n. تَزْكِيَةٌ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He<br>\
purified him, or it. (Er-Rághib, TA.) Sometimes the agent of the verb in this sense is a man;<br>\
as in the saying in the Kur [xci. 9], قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ<br>\
زَكَّاهَا [Verily he prospereth who purifieth it;<br>\
namely, his soul]: sometimes it is God; as in<br>\
[the saying in the Kur xxiv. 21,] وَلٰكِنَّ اللّٰهَ يُزَكِّى<br>\
مَنْ يَشَآءُ [But God purifieth whom He willeth]:<br>\
and sometimes it is the Prophet; as in the saying<br>\
[in the Kur ix. 104], خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ صَدَقَةً تُطَهِّرُهُمْ<br>\
وَتُزَكِّيهِمْ بِهَا [Take thou, from their possessions, a<br>\
poor-rate, whereby thou shalt cleanse them and<br>\
purify them; where (J says in the S) they say<br>\
that تُزَكِّيهِمْ means the same as تُطَهِّرُهُمْ]; and in<br>\
the saying [in the Kur ii. 146], يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ آيَاتِنَا<br>\
وَيُزَكِّيكُمْ [Who reciteth to you our signs, and<br>\
purifieth you]. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence,<br>\
accord. to what is said in the Kur ix. 104, i. e.<br>\
because the act which it signifies is believed to<br>\
purify the performer, or because it is believed to<br>\
purify, or to occasion an increase of, the rest of<br>\
his property,] زكّى مَالَهُ, (S, Mgh, Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
as above, (S, Msb,) He gave the زَكَاة [or poorrate] from his property. (S, Mgh.) And زكّاهُ,<br>\
(S,) or زكّاهُمْ, (Mgh,) He took (S, Mgh) his,<br>\
(S,) or their, (Mgh,) زَكَاة [or poor-rate]. (S,<br>\
Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b4-  زَكَّيْتُهُ also signifies I attributed to him<br>\
زَكَآء, i. e. [purity, or] goodness, or righteousness.<br>\
(Msb.) [And hence, I praised him.] And زكّى<br>\
نَفْسَهُ, (S, Mgh,) inf. n. as above, (S,) He praised<br>\
himself. (S, Mgh.) The doing this is forbidden<br>\
in the Kur liii. 33. (Er-Rághib, TA.) Hence,<br>\
also, تَزْكِيَةُ الشُّهُودِ The pronouncing the witnesses<br>\
to be veracious, and good, or righteous. (Mgh.)<br>\
-A2-  هُوَ يُخَسِّى وَيُزَكِّى He plays, and says, “Is<br>\
it even or odd [or rather odd or even]?” (TA in<br>\
art. خسو;) he takes, or holds, something in his<br>\
hand, and says, “Is it even or odd [or odd or<br>\
even]?” (TA in the present art.) [See زَكَا<br>\
below.]<br>\
4<br>\
ازكاهُ He (God) made it to increase, or<br>\
augment; (S, Msb, K;) [made it to thrive; and<br>\
put it into a good, or right, state, or condition;] namely, seed-produce, (S, Msb, TA,) and<br>\
wealth, or cattle &amp;c, and any other thing capable<br>\
of increase; (TA;) as also ↓ زكّاهُ, (Msb, K, TA,)<br>\
inf. n. تَزْكِيَةٌ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He put it into a<br>\
bag, or some other receptacle; namely, property:<br>\
thus expl. by Aboo-Moosà. (Nh, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  See<br>\
also 1, first sentence.<br>\
5<br>\
تزكّى: see 1, first sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He<br>\
became purified; or he purified himself: (TA:)<br>\
also pronounced اِزَّكَّى, aor. يَزَّكَّى. (Bd in<br>\
xxxv. 19.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And He endeavoured to attain<br>\
much piety; from الزَّكَآءُ. (Bd in lxxxvii. 14.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
And He gave the poor-rate. (S.)<br>\
زَكَا, (S, K, * TA,) without tenween, and accord.<br>\
to some with tenween, and not having the article<br>\
ال prefixed to it; and in like manner خَسَا, which<br>\
is coupled with the former, is without tenween,<br>\
and accord. to some with tenween, and not having<br>\
the article ال prefixed to it; (TA;) [but each has<br>\
ال prefixed to it in the K;] i. q. الشَّفْعُ (S, K) مِنَ<br>\
العَدَدِ (K) [or شَفْعٌ, as meaning An even number;<br>\
a number consisting of pairs; or a single<br>\
pair]: said to be so called because the pair<br>\
are more, or more perfect, or better, (↓ أَزْكَى,)<br>\
than is the one. (TA.) You say خَسَا أَوْ زَكَا or<br>\
خَسًا أَوْ زَكًا [Odd or even?]. (TA.) [See more<br>\
voce خَسَا.]<br>\
زَكَاةٌ. or زَكٰوةٌ, [accord. to El-Hareeree, to be<br>\
written with ا when prefixed to a pronoun, and<br>\
also in the dual number, (see De Sacy&#39;s Anthol.<br>\
Gram. Arabe, p. 67 of the Arabic text,) but this<br>\
rule I have not found to be generally observed,<br>\
even in the best MSS., nor have I in the similar<br>\
cases of صَلٰوةٌ and حَيٰوةٌ, (to which it is also<br>\
applied,) in the best copies of the Kur-án,] of the<br>\
measure فَعَلَةٌ, [i. e., originally زَكَوَةٌ,] like صَدَقَةٌ<br>\
[which is one of its syns.]; a noun of the class of<br>\
homonyms: (IAth, TA:) it signifies Increase, or<br>\
augmentation, (IAth, Er-Rághib, TA,) as also<br>\
↓ زَكَآءٌ [mentioned in the first paragraph as an<br>\
inf. n.], (Msb,) resulting from the blessing of<br>\
God; and this is [said to be] the primary meaning; and is considered as relating to the things of<br>\
the present world and to those of the world to<br>\
come. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Purity. (IAth,<br>\
TA.) And [particularly] The dryness of the earth<br>\
or ground; which is its purity from defilement.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And Purification: a meaning which it<br>\
is said to have in the saying in the Kur [xxiii. 4],<br>\
وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِلزَّكٰوةِ فَاعِلُونَ, (IAth, Mgh, Er-Rághib, TA,) i. e. And who are acting in their<br>\
religious service for God&#39;s purification of them;<br>\
or for their purification of themselves: for<br>\
لِلزَّكٰوة is not here an objective complement of<br>\
فَاعِلُونَ; the ل therein denoting the aim and the<br>\
cause. (Er-Rághib, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also, [as being a<br>\
mode of purification of oneself,] Good, or righteous,<br>\
conduct: and in this sense it has been expl. as<br>\
used in the Kur xviii. 80: or as meaning goodness, or righteousness: (TA:) which ↓ زَكَآءٌ [also]<br>\
signifies. (Msb.) And Religious service; as being<br>\
the means of purification: so [accord. to some] it<br>\
signifies in the saying [in the Kur xix. 14],<br>\
وَحَنَانًا مِنْ لَدُنَّا وَزَكٰوةً [And the disposition to<br>\
mercy, or compassion, from us, and religious<br>\
service]: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or it here means طُهْرَة<br>\
[i. e. purification, or purity]: and [accord. to some,<br>\
if we except the instances mentioned above in the<br>\
next two preceding sentences,] this is the only<br>\
instance in the Kur-án in which it is used in any<br>\
other sense than that which next follows. (Kull<br>\
p. 199.) ―<br>\
-b5-  And [The poor-rate;] the portion,<br>\
or amount, of property, that is given therefrom,<br>\
(M, IAth, Mgh, Msb, K, Er-Rághib, TA,) as the<br>\
due of God, (Er-Rághib, TA,) by its possessor,<br>\
(M, K, TA,) to the poor, (M, Mgh, Er-Rághib,<br>\
TA,) in order that he may purify it thereby:<br>\
(M, IAth, K, TA:) [in the S it is merely said<br>\
that “ the زَكٰوة of property is well known: ” the<br>\
giving it is obligatory, provided that the property<br>\
is of a certain amount, and has been in possession<br>\
eleven months: the portion given varies according to the nature and amount of the property;<br>\
but is generally a fortieth part thereof, or of its<br>\
value; i. e. two and a half per cent.:] it is thus<br>\
termed [for the reason assigned above; or] as<br>\
being a cause of the hope of increase, (Msb, Er-Rághib, TA,) or as causing the soul, or person,<br>\
to thrive, or grow, by means of good things and<br>\
blessings [procured thereby], or for both of these<br>\
reasons. (Er-Rághib, TA.) زَكَاةُ الفِطْرِ [The alms<br>\
of the breaking of the fast, given at the end of<br>\
Ramadán,] is obligatory upon every person of the<br>\
Muslims, the free and the slave, the male and the<br>\
female, the young and the old, the poor and the<br>\
rich; and purifies the faster from unprofitable and<br>\
lewd discourse: it consists of a صَاع [q. v.] of<br>\
dates, or of barley, [or of raisins or some other<br>\
ordinary kind of food,] or half that quantity of<br>\
wheat. (El-Jámi&#39; es-Sagheer, voce زَكَاة.) [The<br>\
pl. is زَكَوَاتٌ.] ―<br>\
-b6-  Also, [as being an attribution<br>\
of purity or goodness or righteousness,] Praise.<br>\
(IAth, TA.) ―<br>\
-b7-  And The pure, or best, part of<br>\
a thing: (K, TA:) on the authority of Aboo-&#39;Alee.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
زَكَآءٌ an inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. (S, K.) See also<br>\
the next preceding paragraph, in two places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also [The increase of the earth; or] the fruits<br>\
caused to come forth by God. (TA.)<br>\
زَكِىٌّ i. q. ↓ زَاكٍ, (Akh, S,) which signifies Increasing [&amp;c., as act part. n. of زَكَا, q. v.]: (Ham<br>\
p. 722:) [and growing, or thriving]: applied in<br>\
this sense to a boy. (Akh, S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  غُلَامًا زَكِيًّا in<br>\
the Kur xix. 19 means [A boy] pure from sins:<br>\
or growing, or increasing, in goodness and righteousness: (Bd:) or purified by nature: or such<br>\
as shall in the future become purified. (TA.) And<br>\
نَفْسًا زَكِيَّةً in the Kur xviii. 73 means [A soul, or<br>\
person,] pure from sins: some read ↓ زَاكِيَةً; but<br>\
the former is more forcible: [or,] accord. to AA,<br>\
↓ the latter means that has never sinned: and the<br>\
former, that has sinned and then been forgiven.<br>\
(Bd.) [Or] رَجُلٌ زَكِىٌّ signifies A good, or<br>\
righteous, man: and the pl. is أَزْكِيَآءُ. (Msb, K, *<br>\
TA.) And also A man enjoying, or leading, a<br>\
plentiful, and a pleasant or an easy, and a soft or<br>\
delicate, life: pl. as above. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
أَرْضٌ زَكِيَّةٌ Good, fat land. (TA in art زكى.)<br>\
زَكَوِىٌّ [generally meaning Of, or relating to,<br>\
the poor-rate] is the rel. n. of زَكَاةٌ; like as<br>\
حَصَوِىٌّ is that of حَصَاةٌ; because the rel. n. reduces the word to its original form: زَكَائِىٌّ is<br>\
vulgar and wrong. (Msb.)<br>\
زَاكٍ, and its fem. زَاكِيَةٌ: see زَكِىٌّ, in three<br>\
places.<br>\
أَزْكَى More, or most, profitable: (Bd in<br>\
ii. 232:) or better, or best: (Jel ibid:) more, or<br>\
most, pure: (Bd in xxiv. 28:) more, or most,<br>\
lawful, (Bd and Jel in xviii. 18,) and good, or<br>\
pleasant: or more, or most, abundant and cheap.<br>\
(Bd ibid.) See also زَكَا as a noun.<br>\
