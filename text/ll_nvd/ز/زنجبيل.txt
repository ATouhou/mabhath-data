load_data( { book: 'll_nvd', text: 'زنجبيلزَنْجَبِيلٌ [Ginger; amomum zinziber;] a certain<br>\
plant growing in the country of the Arabs, in the<br>\
land of &#39;Omán, (AHn, TA,) and in El-Yemen<br>\
also; (TA;) well known: (S:) [or the root<br>\
thereof;] a certain root, or roots, (accord. to different copies of the K,) creeping beneath the<br>\
ground; (K, TA;) burning, or biting, to the<br>\
tongue; (TA;) growing like the stalks of the<br>\
papyrus, (K, TA,) and the رَاسَن [mentioned<br>\
below]: there is no wild sort of it; nor is it a<br>\
tree that is eaten fresh like as herbs, or leguminous<br>\
plants, are eaten; but it is used in a dry state;<br>\
and its conserve is the best of conserves; and the<br>\
best thereof is what is brought from the country<br>\
of the Zinj and China: (TA:) it has a property<br>\
that is heating, or warming, digestive, lenitive in<br>\
a small degree, strengthening to the venereal<br>\
faculty, (K, TA,) clearing to the phlegm, (TA,)<br>\
sharpening to the intellect, (K * TA,) and exhilarating: (TA:) if mixed with the moisture<br>\
of the liver of the goat, and dried, and pulverized,<br>\
and used as a collyrium, it removes the film [upon<br>\
the eye], and obscurity of the sight. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
It is mentioned in the Kur, where it is said,<br>\
[lxxvi. 17 and 18,] كَانَ مِزَاجُهَا زَنْجَبِيلًا عَيْنًا فِيهَا<br>\
تُسَمَّى سَلْسَبِيلًا [The admixture whereof shall be<br>\
زنجبيل, a fountain therein named Selsebeel]:<br>\
i. e. it shall have the flavour of زنجبيل [or ginger],<br>\
which the Arabs esteem very pleasant: it may<br>\
mean that زنجبيل is [essentially] in the wine of<br>\
Paradise: or that it is the admixture thereof: or<br>\
that it is a name for the fountain whence this<br>\
wine is taken, and which is named Selsebeel also.<br>\
(Az, O, TA.) As some assert, (ISd, TA,) it<br>\
means also Wine [absolutely]. (S, ISd, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
زَنْجَبِيلُ الكِلَابِ A certain herb, or leguminous<br>\
plant, the leaves of which are like [those of] the<br>\
خِلَاف [or salix Aegyptia], and the twigs are<br>\
red: it clears the [discoloration of the face termed]<br>\
كَلَف, and the [spots in the skin termed] نَمَش;<br>\
and it kills dogs; (K;) wherefore it is named in<br>\
relation to them. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  زَنْجَبِيلُ العَجَمِ i. q.<br>\
الأُشْتُرْغَازُ [a word of Persian origin, now applied<br>\
by Arabs to A species of carline thistle]. (K.)<br>\
[Accord. to Freytag, Horminum, or salvia silvestris: but this, I believe, is what is called in<br>\
Pers. أُشْتُرْغَان.] ―<br>\
-b5-  زَنْجَبِيلُ الشَّامِ i. q. الرَّاسَنُ [Inula<br>\
helenium, common inula, or elecampane]. (K.)<br>\
