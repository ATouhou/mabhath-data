-b2-  زَنَأَ إِلَيْهِ,<br>\
(S, K,) aor. as above, (K,) inf. n. زُنُوْءٌ (S, K) and<br>\
زَنْءٌ, (K,) He (a man, S) had recourse to it (a<br>\
thing, TA) for refuge, protection, preservation,<br>\
concealment, covert, or lodging. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
He approached it, or drew near to it; (K, TA;)<br>\
namely, a thing. (TA.) [Hence,] زَنَأَ الخَمْسِينَ,<br>\
(S,) or لِلْخَمْسِينَ, inf. n. زَنْءٌ, (TA,) He drew<br>\
near to the [age of] fifty [years]. (S, TA.) ―<br>\

See also 2, in two places: and see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  زَنَأَ is also<br>\
expl. in the K as signifying خَنَقَ [He throttled,<br>\
or strangled]: but [SM says,] I have not found<br>\
any of the leading lexicologists to have mentioned<br>\
this, unless it be a mistranscription for حَقَنَ [a<br>\
meaning assigned to this verb below: see 4].<br>\
(TA.)<br>\

زَنّأ عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. تَزْنِئَةٌ, He straitened, or<br>\
oppressed, him; made strait, or close, to him;<br>\
(S, K, TA;) as also عليه ↓ زَنَأَ. (TA.) The verb<br>\
occurs without ء, written زَنَّى, by poetic license,<br>\
in a saying of a rájiz cited in art. شدخ, as an ex. of<br>\
the word شَادِخَةٌ. (S.) And عَلَيْهِ الحِجَارَةَ ↓ زَنَؤُوا<br>\

strait, or close, to him, or upon him. (TA.)<br>\

the thing]. (TA.) ―<br>\

the latter verb being trans. as well as intrans.<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
زَنَآءٌ Straitness, or narrowness; syn. ضِيقٌ. (S.<br>\
[So in my copies: perhaps a mistranscription for<br>\
ضَيِّقٌ, a meaning mentioned in the next sentence.])<br>\
-A2-  Strait, or narrow; syn. ضَيِّقٌ: you say مَكَانٌ<br>\
زَنَآءٌ [A strait, or narrow, place]: and بِئْرٌ زَنَآءٌ [A<br>\
narrow well]: so in the Fáïk. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Short<br>\

-b3-  Retaining, or<br>\
suppressing, his urine; (S, Msb, K;) as also<br>\
↓ زَانِئٌ. (Msb.) So in a trad. in which it is said<br>\
that a man is forbidden to pray when he is زنآء;<br>\
(S, TA;) or where it is said that the prayer of one<br>\
who is ↓ زَانِئ will not be accepted: (Msb:) or the<br>\
latter word in this case means one who is ascending<br>\
a mountain; because he has not full power [to<br>\
pray], or because he is straitened by being out<br>\
of breath. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  Also, [app. because of its<br>\
narrowness,] A grave. (TA.)<br>\

أَزْنَأُ More, or most, strait: so in the saying<br>\
كَانَ لَا يُحِبُّ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا أَزْنَأَهَا [He used not to<br>\
love, of worldly enjoyments, or blessings, save the<br>\
more, or most, strait thereof]. (MF.)<br>\
