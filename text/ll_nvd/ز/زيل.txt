زَالَهُ is syn. with أَزَالَهُ, q. v. (S, Msb, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
زال زَوَالَهُ, or زال اللّٰهُ زَوَالَهُ; and زال زَوَالَهَا: see<br>\
زَوَالٌ, in art. زول. And زِيلَ زَوِيلُهُ and زَوِيلُهَا and<br>\
زَوَالُهُ: see زَوِيلٌ, in art. زول; and for the first,<br>\
see also زَوَالٌ, in that art. ―<br>\
-b3-  زِلْتُهُ, (S, K,) aor.<br>\
أَزِيلُهُ, inf. n. زَيْلٌ, (S,) [first pers. of زَالَهُ,] signifies<br>\
also I put it, or set it, apart, away, or aside;<br>\
removed it; or separated it; (S, K, TA;) namely,<br>\
a thing, (S, TA,) from another thing: (TA:)<br>\
and ↓ ازالهُ also signifies he separated it; like زَالَهُ.<br>\
(TA.) See also 4. One says, زِلْ ضَأْنَكَ مِنْ مِعْزَاكَ<br>\
Remove, or separate, thy sheep from thy goats.<br>\
(S, * TA.) And ↓ زِلْتُهُ فَلَمْ يَنْزَلْ I separated it<br>\
[partly], but it did not become [wholly] separated.<br>\
(S, K.)<br>\
-A2-  مَا زَالَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا (S in art. زول, and<br>\
Msb,) is like مَا بَرِحَ, both in its [original] measure,<br>\
[which is مَا زَيِلَ accord. to most authorities,] and<br>\
in its meaning, which is [He ceased not to do<br>\
such a thing, or he continued to do such a thing,<br>\
for it denotes] the continuing to do a thing [as in<br>\
the ex. above], and a constant state [as in the<br>\
phrase مَا زَالَ زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا Zeyd ceased not to be, or<br>\
continued to be, standing]: (Msb:) [using the<br>\
first pers.,] one says, مَا زِلْتُ أَفْعَلُهُ [and مَا زَلْتُ,<br>\
as appears from what follows], meaning مَا بَرِحْتُ<br>\
[i. e. I ceased not to do it,  or I continued to do<br>\
it], (K,) aor. أَزَالُ [supposing the measure of the<br>\
pret. to be originally فَعِلْتُ] (Msb, K) and أَزِيلُ<br>\
[supposing the measure of the pret. to be originally<br>\
فعَلْتُ]: (K:) the verb is seldom [in the Msb<br>\
“ never ”] used without a negative particle: (Az,<br>\
TA:) one says زِلْتُ أَفْعَلُ meaning مَا زِلْتُ أَفْعَلُ;<br>\
but this is rare: (K:) and مَا زِيلَ يَفْعَلُ كَذَا,<br>\
(S, Msb, K,) a phrase used by some of the Arabs,<br>\
(Msb,) mentioned by Akh, (S, TA,) as is meant<br>\
in [some of the copies of] the K by the addition<br>\
عَنْهُ, though Akh is not mentioned in what precedes. (TA.) The verb in مَا زَالَ and لَا يَزَالُ is<br>\
used in the manner of كَانَ in governing the<br>\
noun [which is its subject] in the nom. case and<br>\
the predicate in the accus. case [as in مَا زَالَ زَيْدٌ<br>\
قَائِمًا, expl. above]; but one may not say, مَا زَالَ<br>\
زَيْدٌ إِلَّا مُنْطَلِقًا, like as one says, مَا كَانَ زَيْدٌ إِلَّا<br>\
مُنْطَلِقًا; for زَالَ denotes a negation, [meaning he<br>\
did not a thing, or he was not doing &amp;c.,] and<br>\
مَا and لَا denote negation, and two negations together denote an affirmation; so that ما زال is<br>\
affirmative like كَانَ; and as one may not say,<br>\
كَانَ زَيْدٌ إِلَّا مَنْطَلِقًا, so one may not say, مَا زَالَ<br>\
زَيْدٌ إِلَّا مُنْطَلِقًا. (Er-Rághib, TA.) One says also,<br>\
مَا زِلْتُ بِزَيْدٍ حَتَّى فَعَلَ ذٰلِكَ and مَا زِلْتُ وَزَيْدًا [I<br>\
desisted not with Zeyd until he did that], (Sb, K, *<br>\
TA,) inf. n. زِيَالٌ. (Sb, TA.) لَمْ يَزَلْ [He,  or it,<br>\
has not ceased to be &amp;c., i. e., has ever been &amp;c.,<br>\
(see أَزَلٌ,)] is said of God, as meaning He has<br>\
never been nonexistent; and لَا يَزَالُ, said of Him,<br>\
He will never be nonexistent. (Kull p. 31.) This<br>\
[incomplete i. e. non-attributive] verb and the complete [i. e. attributive, which signifies “ it ceased<br>\
to be ” or “ exist,” &amp;c.,] differ in their components; the latter being composed of ل و ز; and<br>\
this, of ل ى ز: or the incomplete is altered from<br>\
the complete; being made to be with kesr to its<br>\
medial radical letter, [for it is generally held to be<br>\
from زَيِلَ or زَوِلَ,] after its having been [originally زَوَلَ,] with fet-h: or it is from زَالَهُ, aor.<br>\
يَزِيلُهُ, meaning “ he put it,” or “ set it, apart,” &amp;c.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
2<br>\
زيّلهُ, (S, K,) inf. n. تَزْيِيلٌ, (S,) He separated<br>\
it [i. e. acompany of men, or an assemblage of things,]<br>\
much (Fr, Az, S, * K, * TA,) [or greatly, or widely;<br>\
or dispersed it;] differing in degree from زَالَهُ like as<br>\
مَيَّزَهُ does from مَازَهُ. (TA.) Hence, فَزَيَّلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ<br>\
[And we will separate them widely, one from<br>\
another], (Fr, Az, S, K, TA,) in the Kur [x. 29];<br>\
(Fr, Az, S, TA;) where some read بَيْنَهُمْ ↓ فَزَايَلْنَا;<br>\
like لَا تُصَعِّرْ and لا تُصَاعِرْ [in the Kur xxxi. 17].<br>\
(Fr, Az, TA.) [See also an ex. in a verse cited<br>\
voce دُونَ.] زَيَّلْتُ is of the measure فَعَّلْتُ because<br>\
its inf. n. is as above; for were it فَيْعَلْتُ, one<br>\
would say زَيَّلَةٌ [of the measure فَيْعَلَةٌ]. (S.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
تَزْيِيلٌ is also [said to be] an [irreg.] inf. n. of 5,<br>\
q. v. (Lh, K.)<br>\
3<br>\
زايلهُ, (S, Msb, K,) inf. n. مُزَايَلَةٌ and زِيَالٌ,<br>\
(S, K,) He separated himself from him. (S, Msb,<br>\
K. [See also 1 in art. زول, last signification.])<br>\
One says, خَالِطُوا النَّاسَ وَزَايِلُوهُمْ, meaning [Mix<br>\
ye with men in familiar, or social, intercourse,<br>\
and] separate yourselves from them in deeds, or<br>\
actions. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  زَايَلَتْهُ بِوَجْهِهَا She veiled her<br>\
face from him. (IAar on the authority of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, TA in art. بزر.) [See also 6.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
زَايَلْنَا بَيْنَهُمْ: see 2. And see also what next<br>\
follows.<br>\
4<br>\
ازالهُ (S, Msb, K) مِنْ مَكَانِهِ (S) or عَنْ مَكَانِهِ,<br>\
(K,) inf. n. إِزَالَةٌ (K) and إِزَالٌ; (Lh, K;) and<br>\
↓ زَالَهُ, (S, Msb, K, and Har p. 393,) aor. يَزِيلُهُ,<br>\
(S, K, and Har ubi suprà,) or يَزَالُهُ, like يَنَالُهُ,<br>\
(Msb,) inf. n. زَيْلٌ, (S, K, Har,) or زِيَالٌ; (Msb;)<br>\
both signify the same; (S, Msb, K;) He removed<br>\
it [from its place; as the former is expl. in art.<br>\
زول]; (Msb in explanation of both, and Har<br>\
ubi suprà in explanation of the latter;) and so<br>\
↓ زَايَلَهُ, of which the primary signification is that<br>\
first assigned to it in the next preceding paragraph. (Har ubi suprà.) See also 1, fourth sentence. [And see 4 in art. زول.]<br>\
5<br>\
تزيّلوا, (S, * Msb, K,) inf. n. تَزَيُّلٌ and ↓ تَزْيِيلٌ,<br>\
(K,) the latter [irreg., being properly inf. n. of<br>\
2,] of the dial. of El-Hijáz, mentioned by Lh;<br>\
(TA;) and ↓ تزايلوا, inf. n. تَزَايُلٌ; (K;) i. q.<br>\
تَفَرَّقُوا [i. e. They became separated much, or<br>\
greatly, or widely; or became dispersed: or rather,<br>\
the former verb, being quasi-pass. of 2, has this<br>\
meaning; and the latter verb, as quasi-pass. of 3,<br>\
means simply they became separated, one from<br>\
another]: (S, K:) [for] ↓ التَّزَايُلُ signifies التَّبَايُنُ:<br>\
(S, K:) تزيّلوا is syn. with تَمَيَّزُوا: thus in the<br>\
Kur [xlviii. 25], where it is said, لَوْ تَزَيَّلُوا لَعَذَّبْنَا<br>\
الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا [Had they been widely separated,<br>\
one from another, we had assuredly punished<br>\
those who disbelieved]: (Msb, * TA:) and some<br>\
here read ↓ تَزَايَلُوا. (Bd.) [See also 7.]<br>\
6<br>\
تَزَاْيَلَ see 5, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] التَّزَايُلُ<br>\
signifies also الاِحْتِشَامُ; (K, TA;) a tropical meaning: (TA:) one says, تزايل عَنْهُ, meaning اِحْتَشَمَهُ<br>\
[i. e. (tropical:)  He was, or became, abashed at him]: (O,<br>\
TA:) because the مُحْتَشِم separates himself, and<br>\
shrinks, from another. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [See also مُتَزَايِلَةٌ,<br>\
whence it seems that one says, of a woman,<br>\
تَزَايَلَتْ, meaning She veiled her face from men:<br>\
see likewise 3.]<br>\
7<br>\
انزال It was, or became, put, or set, apart,<br>\
away, or aside; removed; or separated; (S, K;)<br>\
عَنْهُ [from him, or it]. (TA.) One says, زِلْتُهُ<br>\
فَلَمْ يَنْزَلْ: see 1. (S, K.) [See also 5. And see<br>\
7 in art. زول.]<br>\
زَيَلٌ Width between the thighs; (S, K;) like<br>\
فَجَجٌ. (S.)<br>\
أَزْيَلٌ, (K,) or أَزْيَلُ الفَخِذَيْنِ, occurring in a<br>\
trad., (TA,) Having the thighs wide apart.<br>\
(K, TA.)<br>\
مِزْيَلٌ A man acute or sharp or quick in intellect, clever, ingenious, skilful, knowing, or<br>\
intelligent; knowing with respect to the subtilties,<br>\
niceties, abstrusities, or obscurities, of things,<br>\
affairs, or cases; as also ↓ مِزْيَالٌ: (K:) or vehement in altercation, or litigation, who shifts<br>\
(يَزُولُ) from one plea, or argument, to another:<br>\
occurring in a trad., in which it is said, with<br>\
reference to two claimants, كَانَ أَحَدُهُمَا مِخْلَطًا<br>\
مِزْيَلًا [One of them two was a person who mixed<br>\
in, or entered into, affairs; vehement in altercation, &amp;c.]: (IAth, TA:) accord. to which latter<br>\
explanation, it should be mentioned in art. زول,<br>\
as it is by the author of the L; but Z mentions it<br>\
in the present art., like F. (TA.)<br>\
مِزْيَالٌ: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
الجيب المُزَايِلُ [a mistranscription for الحَبِيبُ]<br>\
means البَائِنُ [i. e. The beloved, or the friend, who<br>\
is in a state of separation, or disunion]. (TA.)<br>\
مُتَزَايِلَةٌ A woman who veils her face from men.<br>\
(IAar on the authority of Ibn-Ez-Zubeyr, TA in<br>\
this art. and in art. برز.)<br>\
