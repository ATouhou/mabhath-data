زَرْنَقَةٌ [as inf. n. of زَرْنَقَ] The irrigating<br>\
[land] by means of the زُرْنُوق [here app. meaning<br>\
rivulet]. (Mgh, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And The setting up a<br>\
[pillar-like structure such as is termed] زُرْنُوق by<br>\
a well. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  One says also, زَرْنَقْتُهُ, (K,) inf. n.<br>\
as above, (TK,) meaning I clad him [app. فِى<br>\
الثِّيَابِ in the clothes: see Q. 2]: or زَرْنَقْتُ اللِّبَاسِ<br>\
إِيَّاهُ I put the clothing upon him; or clad him<br>\
therewith. (TK)<br>\
-A3-  And لَا يُزَرْنِقُكَ أَحَدٌ عَلَى<br>\
فَضْلِ زَيْدٍ [No one will exceed to thee the excel-lence of Zeyd]. (TA. [It is there indicated that<br>\
this is from زَرْنَقَةٌ as syn. with زِيَادَةٌ.])<br>\
-A4-  [See<br>\
زَرْنَقَةٌ as a simple subst. below.]<br>\
Q. 2<br>\
تَزَرْنَقَ He drew water by means of the<br>\
زُرْنُوق, (Mgh, K, TA,) or the زُرْنُوقَانِ, (TA,) for<br>\
hire. (Mgh, K, TA.) Hence the saying of &#39;Alee,<br>\
لَا أَدَعُ الحَجَّ وَلَوْ تَزَرْنَقْتُ, meaning I will not omit,<br>\
or neglect, the pilgrimage, though I should draw<br>\
water by means of the زرنوق, or زرنوقان, and perform it with the hire obtained thereby: thus it is<br>\
explained: another explanation will be found in<br>\
what follows. (Mgh, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  تزرنق فِى الثِّيابِ<br>\
He clad, and covered, himself in the clothes.<br>\
(K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And hence, [it is said,] because implying<br>\
concealment of the excess [of the price] in the<br>\
sale, (TA,) تزرنق also signifies تَعَيَّنَ, (Mgh, K,<br>\
TA, [in the CK, erroneously, تَغَيَّرَ,]) from الزَّرْنَقَةُ<br>\
meaning العِينَةُ; (Mgh;) i. e. He bought on credit,<br>\
for an excess [in the amount of the price]. (TK.)<br>\
And accord. to some, وَلَوْ تَزَرْنَقْتُ, in the saying of<br>\
&#39;Alee mentioned above, means وَلَوْ تَعَيَّنْتُ, (Mgh,)<br>\
i. e. وَلَوْ تَعَيَّنْتُ عِينَةَ الزَّادِ وَالرَّاحِلَةِ [though I should<br>\
buy on credit, for more than the current price,<br>\
the travelling-provision and the camel to be ridden]:<br>\
(TA:) but the former explanation is the more<br>\
likely. (Mgh.)<br>\
زَرْنَقَةٌ inf. n. of زَرْنَقَ. (TK. [See Q. 1, above.])<br>\
-A2-  Also i. q. عِينَةٌ; (IAar, JK, Mgh, K;) i. e.<br>\
The buying of a thing from a man on credit, for<br>\
more than its [current] price: (JK, Fáïk:) or<br>\
the doing thus, and then selling it to him, or to<br>\
another, for less than the price for which it was<br>\
purchased. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Increase, excess, or<br>\
addition; syn. زِيَادَةٌ. (K.) [For زَرْنَقَةٌ in this and<br>\
the following senses, Freytag, in his Lex., has<br>\
written زَرْنَق.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And Debt. (K, TA. [In the<br>\
CK, الدِّينُ is erroneously put for الدَّيْنُ: and it<br>\
is there added, “as though arabicized from زَرْنَهْ;<br>\
i. e. الذَّهَبَ لَبِسَ: ” but what this should be I know<br>\
not, unless it be a mistranscription for الذَّهَبُ لَيْسَ;<br>\
for, in Pers., زَرْ means “ gold,” and نَهْ is a negative.])<br>\
-A3-  Also Perfect, or consummate, beauty.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
زُرْنُوقٌ, as some pronounce it, is by others pronounced زَرْنُوقٌ, which is of a strange form, [said<br>\
to be] of the measure فَعْنُولٌ, (IJ, TA,) mentioned<br>\
by Kr on the authority of Lh: (TA:) [the dual]<br>\
زُرْنُوقَانِ, (S, Mgh, K,) mentioned by J in art.<br>\
زرق, the ن being regarded by him as augmentative, but by the author of the K as radical, (TA,)<br>\
also pronounced زَرْنُوقَانِ, (K,) signifies Two pillarlike structures (مَنَارَتَانِ) constructed by the head<br>\
of a well, (S, Mgh, K,) on the two sides thereof;<br>\
(K;) or two walls; or two posts; (Mgh;) across<br>\
which is placed a piece of wood, (S, Mgh,) called<br>\
the نَعَامَة; (S;) and to this is suspended the pulley<br>\
by means of which the water is drawn: (S, Mgh:)<br>\
or two structures like the signs set up to show<br>\
the way, by the brink of a well, of clay or of<br>\
stones: (TA:) accord. to the S, (TA,) if of wood,<br>\
they are called دِعَامَتَان: or, as El-Kilábee says,<br>\
if of wood, they are called نَعَامَتَانِ, and the crosspiece is called the عَجَلَة, and to this the large<br>\
bucket is suspended: (S, TA:) pl. زَرَانِيقُ. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  زُرْنُوقٌ also signifies A rivulet; (Sh, Mgh, K;)<br>\
app. a rivulet in which runs the water that is<br>\
drawn by means of the زرنوق. (Sh, Mgh,* TA.)<br>\
زِرْنِيقٌ i. q. زِرْنِيخٌ [i. e. Arsenic]; an arabicized<br>\
word; (K;) as is also the latter [q. v.]. (TA.)<br>\
مُزَرْنِقٌ A setter-up of what are termed زَرْنُوقَانِ.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
