زَرْبٌ [as an inf. n.] signifies The constructing<br>\
a زَرِيبَة, (K, TA,) i. e. an enclosure of wood, (TA,)<br>\
for sheep, or goats: (K, TA:) you say, زَرَبْتُ<br>\
الغَنَمَ, aor. أَزْرُبُهَا, inf. n. زَرْبٌ: (TA:) [or this, I<br>\
think, is a mistake for what here follows:] زَرَبْتُ<br>\
لِلْغَنَمِ, aor. أَزْرُبُ, inf. n. زَرْبٌ (Ks, S:) [i. e. I constructed an enclosure of wood for the sheep or<br>\
goats: this meaning is plainly indicated, though<br>\
not expressed, in the S and TA:] but in some<br>\
copies of the K, in the place of بِنَآءُ الزَّرِيبَةِ لِلْغَنَمِ,<br>\
as explaining الزَّرْبُ, we find بنات الزريبة الغنم<br>\
[meaning that ↓ بَنَاتُ الزَّرِيبَةِ signifies sheep, or<br>\
goats]. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And زَرَبَ البَهْمَ فِى زَرْبِهَا or<br>\
زَرِيبَتِهَا He put the بهم [i. e. lambs or kids, or young<br>\
lambs or kids,] into their place [or enclosure of<br>\
wood]. (A. [And the like is said in the Ham<br>\
p. 195.])<br>\
-A2-  زَرِبَ, aor.<br>\
زَرَبَ, (K, TA,) said of water,<br>\
(TA,) It flowed; (K, TA;) like سَرِبَ. (TA.)<br>\
7<br>\
انزرب البَهْمُ فِى الزَّرْبُ The بهم [i. e. lambs or<br>\
kids, or young lambs or kids,] entered into the<br>\
زرب [or enclosure of wood]. (A, TA. *) ―<br>\
-b2-  And<br>\
انزرب الصَّائِدُ (S, TA) فِى قُتْرَتِهِ (TA) (assumed tropical:)  The hunter,<br>\
or sportsman, entered into his lurking-place.<br>\
(S, TA.)<br>\
9<br>\
ازربّ, inf. n. اِزْرِبَابٌ, It (a plant, or herb,)<br>\
became yellow, or red, while having in it greenness. (K, TA.)<br>\
زَرْبٌ A place of entrance. (AA, S, A, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
And hence, accord. to AA, (S,) the same word,<br>\
(S, A, K,) and ↓ زِرْبٌ, (ISk, S, K,) as some pronounce it, (ISk, S,) and ↓ زَرِيبَةٌ, (S, A, K,) (assumed tropical:)  The<br>\
place of sheep or goats; (A, K, TA;) [i. e.] an<br>\
enclosure of wood for sheep or goats: (S:) [said<br>\
in the TA to be tropical; but not so accord. to<br>\
the A:] pl. of the first (A, K) and second (K)<br>\
زُرُوبٌ, (A, K,) and of the last زَرَائِبُ. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
And, as being likened thereto, (A,) زَرْبٌ and<br>\
↓ زَرِيبَةٌ signify also (tropical:)  The lurking-place (قُتْرَة) of<br>\
a hunter, or sportsman, (S, A, K,) or of an<br>\
archer, or a shooter: (TA in explanation of the<br>\
former word:) both signify a well [or pit] which<br>\
the hunter, or sportsman, digs for himself that he<br>\
may lie in wait therein for the game. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
See also the next paragraph.<br>\
زِرْبٌ: see the next preceding paragraph. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Also A channel in which water flows; (K;) and<br>\
so ↓ زَرْبٌ. (TA.) It is said in a rejez of Kaab,<br>\
تَبِيتُ بَيْنَ الزِّرْبِ وَالكَنِيفِ<br>\
She passes the night between the channel of water<br>\
and the concealing, or protecting, place: meaning<br>\
that she is fed in the enclosures for camels &amp;c.,<br>\
[فِى الحظائر, thus I read for الحضائر (an evident<br>\
mistranscription) in the TA,] and among the tents,<br>\
or houses; not in the pasture-land. (TA.)<br>\
زِرْبِىٌّ and زُرْبِىٌّ, (K,) or, accord. to the L [and<br>\
the A], on the authority of IAar, ↓ زَرْبِيَّةٌ, also said<br>\
to be written زِرْبِيَّةٌ and زُرْبِيَّةٌ, (TA,) are sings. of<br>\
↓ زَرَابِىُّ, (K, TA,) which signifies نَمَارِقُ [app. as<br>\
meaning Small pillows]: (S, A, K:) and carpets:<br>\
or any things which are spread, and upon which one<br>\
leans, or reclines: (A, K:) the like of this is said<br>\
by Zj in explaining a phrase in which it occurs in<br>\
the Kur lxxxviii. 16: or, accord. to Fr, it signifies carpets (طَنَافِس) having a fine nap, or pile:<br>\
(TA:) also, [particularly,] (A,) carpets (قُطُوع,<br>\
A, or طَنَافِس, Har p. 377) of the fabric of El-<br>\
Heereh; and the like thereof in fabric: (A, and<br>\
Har ubi suprà:) or ↓ زربيّة signifies [simply] a<br>\
carpet (طِنْفِسَةٌ): and a carpet (بِسَاط) having a<br>\
nap, or pile: and a [piece of leather that is<br>\
spread upon the ground, such as is called] نِطَع:<br>\
and the like thereof in make. (TA. [See also the<br>\
last sentence of this paragraph.]) [Hence,] one<br>\
says, البَغْضَآءِ بَيْنَهُمْ مَبْثُوثَةٌ ↓ زَرَابِىُّ (tropical:)  [The embellished<br>\
coverings of vehement hatred are spread between<br>\
them; i. e. vehement hatred concealed by fair<br>\
professions &amp;c. subsists between them]. (A.) The<br>\
following saying, of Artáh Ibn-Suheiyeh,<br>\
وَنَحْنُ بَنُو عَمٍّ عَلَى ذَاتِ بَيْنِنَا<br>\
فِيهَا بِغْضَةٌ وَتَنافُسُ ↓ زَرَابِىُّ<br>\
is expl. by En-Nemiree as meaning (assumed tropical:)  [And we<br>\
are sons of a paternal uncle, but] upon our enmity<br>\
is a comely covering beneath which it is latent;<br>\
[therein are vehement hatred and envious competition;] زَرَابِىُّ signifying [properly] carpets of<br>\
sundry colours: (Ham p. 196:) it is also said to<br>\
mean, in this instance, (assumed tropical:)  [concealed] enmities, and<br>\
sayings that give pain; [the former of these two<br>\
meanings being] from زَرَبْتُ البَهْمَ فِى الزَّرِيبَةِ, i. e.<br>\
أَدْخَلْتُهُ: [the latter of them app. suggested by<br>\
another reading, namely, زَأَانِبُ in the place of<br>\
زَرَابِىُّ; mentioned and thus explained in the Ham<br>\
ubi suprà: the poet, therefore, is supposed to have<br>\
meant, upon our state of union, or concord, (ذات<br>\
بيننا having two contr. significations,) have supervened concealed enmities, &amp;c.:] or, as some say,<br>\
the reading in the deewán of Artáh is زَرَائِبُ, as<br>\
though pl. of ↓ زَرِيبَةٌ, which is likewise made to<br>\
denote enmity because it is made to enter (تُزْرَبُ,<br>\
i. e. تُدْخَلُ,) into the heart; or which may be<br>\
metaphorically applied to a place of enmity latent<br>\
in the bosom, from the same word as signifying the<br>\
“ place in which are put lambs, or kids, and sheep,<br>\
or goats: ” or, supposing the right reading to be<br>\
↓ زَرَابِىُّ, the poet may very properly mean, upon<br>\
the vacant space between our tents, or houses, are<br>\
carpets (طَنَافِس and بُسُط) spread for us, and we<br>\
sit thereon, near together in the places, but with<br>\
the hearts remote: (idem p. 195:) but with the<br>\
reading زَأَانِبُ, mentioned above, occurs another<br>\
variation, thus: عَلَى ذَاكَ بَيْنَنَا زَأَانِبُ; meaning,<br>\
notwithstanding that, between us are sayings that<br>\
give pain. (Idem p. 196.) ―<br>\
-b2-  ↓ وَيْلٌ لِلزَّرْبِيَّةِ, occurring in a trad., is said to mean (tropical:)  Wo to those who<br>\
go in to lords, or princes, and, when they say<br>\
what is evil, or say anything, say, He has spoken<br>\
truth: such persons being likened, in respect of<br>\
their variable conduct, to one of the زَرَابِىّ mentioned above in the first sentence of this paragraph; or to sheep, or goats, which are thus<br>\
called in relation to the زَرْب, i. e. the enclosure to<br>\
which they repair, because they are obsequious to<br>\
the lords, or princes, and follow their steps with<br>\
the submissiveness of sheep or goats to their<br>\
pastor. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Accord. to El-Muärrij, (TA,)<br>\
↓ زَرَابِىُّ is applied to plants, as meaning Such as<br>\
have become yellow, or red, while having in them<br>\
greenness: (K, TA:) and when they saw the<br>\
colours in carpets and other articles of furniture<br>\
that are spread, they likened them to such plants.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
زَرْبِيَّةٌ and زِرْبِيَّةٌ and زُرْبِيَّةٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-  [Golius, finding the second and third of these words expl. by<br>\
the Pers. شادروان, (which is often applied by<br>\
Arabs in the present day to “ an artificial fountain<br>\
that throws up water,”) has erroneously, as Freytag has observed, supposed that they may signify<br>\
“ Euripus, fons in altum saliens. ”]<br>\
زَرِيبَةٌ: see زَرْبٌ, in two places: and see 1, first<br>\
sentence. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also (assumed tropical:)  The lurking-place of a beast<br>\
of prey. (S, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also زِرْبِىٌّ.<br>\
زَرَابِىُّ: see زِرْبِىٌّ, in five places.<br>\
زِرْيَابٌ, (in the CK زِرْباب,) an arabicized word,<br>\
(K, TA,) from [the Pers.] زَرْ آبْ, the hemzeh [in<br>\
آبْ, for أَابْ,] being changed into ى, (TA,) Gold:<br>\
(IAar, K:) or the water thereof [i. e. water-gold;<br>\
which may be deemed the more correct, as agreeing with the original]. (K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And Anything<br>\
yellow. (K.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A certain black singingbird; (MF, TA;) called also ابو زولق, [app. a<br>\
mistranscription for ابو زريق, as in Freytag&#39;s<br>\
Lex., i. e. أَبُو زُرَيْقٍ,] accord. to the book entitled<br>\
“ Mantik et-Teyr. ” (TA.)<br>\
مِزْرَابٌ i. q. مِرْزَابٌ [q. v., said to be not a chaste<br>\
word]. (K.)<br>\
