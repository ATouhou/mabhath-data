زَلَمَ, (aor.<br>\
زَلُمَ, inf. n. زَلْمٌ, TK,) He cut off one&#39;s<br>\
nose [and app. anything projecting, or prominent:<br>\
see 2: and see also 8]. (ISh, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  (assumed tropical:)  He made<br>\
his gift little, or small, in quantity or amount;<br>\
(S, K;) [as though he cut off something from it;]<br>\
in [some of the copies of] the S, [but not so in<br>\
mine,] ↓ زلّم. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He filled (S, K) a water-ing-trough, or tank, (S,) or a vessel; (K;) as<br>\
also ↓ زلّم, inf. n. تَزْلِيمٌ. (AHn, K.)<br>\
2<br>\
زلّم السَّهْمَ, (S, K, *) inf. n. تَزْلِيمٌ, (K,) He cut<br>\
[or pared] the arrow, and made its proportion or<br>\
conformation, and its workmanship, good: (S:)<br>\
[he shaped it well:] or he made it even and<br>\
supple. (K.) And زُلِّمَ is said of anything as<br>\
meaning Its edges were pared off. (TA.) [Hence,]<br>\
زلّم الرَّحَى He made the mill-stone round, and took<br>\
from its edges. (K.) Dhu-r-Rummeh says,<br>\
كَأَرْحَآءِ رَقْدٍ زَلَّمَتْهَا المَنَاقِرُ<br>\
[Like the mill-stones of Rakd (a mountain so<br>\
called) which the picks have rounded by taking<br>\
from their edges]: he likens the foot of the camel<br>\
to a mill-stone from the edges of which the مَعَاوِل<br>\
have taken, (S, TA,) and which they have made<br>\
even. (TA.) And زَلَّمْتُ الحَجَرَ signifies I cut<br>\
the stone, and prepared it properly for a millstone. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 1, in two places. ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
زلّم غِذَآءَهُ (assumed tropical:)  He made his food, or nutriment, bad,<br>\
[i. e. fed him ill,] (K, TA,) so that his body<br>\
became small. (TA.)<br>\

اِزْدَلَمَ He cut off one&#39;s head. (ISh, K.)<br>\
And He extirpated one&#39;s nose. (K.)<br>\
زَلْمٌ or زُلْمٌ, whence the phrase هُوَ العَبْدُ زَلْمًا:<br>\
see زَلْمَة.<br>\
زَلَمٌ and ↓ زُلَمٌ An arrow without a head and<br>\
without feathers: pl. أَزْلَامٌ: (S, Mgh, Msb, K:)<br>\
which was applied to those [divining-] arrows by<br>\
means of which the Arabs in the Time of Ignorance sought to know what was allotted to<br>\
them: (S, K:) they were arrows upon which the<br>\
Arabs in the Time of Ignorance wrote “ Command ” and “ Prohibition; ” (Mgh, Msb;) or<br>\
upon some of which was written “ My Lord hath<br>\
commanded me; ” and upon some, “My Lord<br>\
hath forbidden me; ” (Har p. 465;) or they were<br>\
three arrows; upon one of which was written<br>\
“ My Lord hath commanded me; ” and upon<br>\
another, “My Lord hath forbidden me; ” and<br>\
the third was blank; (Bd in v. 4;) and they put<br>\
them in a receptacle, (Mgh, Msb,) and when any<br>\
one of them desired to make a journey, or to<br>\
accomplish a want, (Mgh,) or when he desired to<br>\
perform some affair, (Msb,) he put his hand into<br>\
that receptacle, (Mgh, Msb,) and took forth an<br>\
arrow; (Msb;) and if the arrow upon which was<br>\
“ Command ” [or “ My Lord hath commanded<br>\
me ” (Har ubi suprà)] came forth, he went to<br>\
accomplish his purpose; but if that upon which<br>\
was “ Prohibition ” [or “ My Lord hath forbidden me ” (Har)] came forth, he refrained;<br>\
(Mgh, Msb;) and if the blank came forth, they<br>\
shuffled them a second time: (Bd ubi suprà:) or,<br>\
as some say, the ازلام were white pebbles, upon<br>\
which they thus wrote, and by means of which<br>\
they sought to know what was allotted to them in<br>\
the manner expl. above: (Har ubi suprà:) or,<br>\
accord. to Az, the ازلام [were arrows that] belonged to Kureysh, in the Time of Ignorance,<br>\
upon which were written “ He hath commanded ”<br>\
and “ He hath forbidden,” and “ Do thou ” and<br>\
“ Do thou not; ” they had been well shaped<br>\
(زُلِّمَتْ) and made even, and placed in the Kaabeh,<br>\
the ministers of the House taking care of them;<br>\
and when a man desired to go on a journey, or to<br>\
marry, he came to the minister, and said, “Take<br>\
thou forth for me a زلم; ” and thereupon he would<br>\
take it forth, and look at it; and if the arrow of<br>\
command came forth, he went to accomplish that<br>\
which he had purposed to do; but if the arrow of<br>\
prohibition came forth, he refrained from that<br>\
which he desired to do: [it is said that] there<br>\
were seven of the arrows thus called with the<br>\
minister of the Kaabeh, having marks upon them,<br>\
and used for this purpose: (Jel in v. 4:) and<br>\
sometimes there were with the man two such<br>\
arrows, which he put into his sword-case; and<br>\
when he desired to seek the knowledge of what<br>\
was allotted to him, he took forth one of them.<br>\
(TA.) Some say that the أَزْلَام are The arrows of<br>\
the game called المَيْسِر: but this is a mistake.<br>\
(TA.) The seeking to obtain the knowledge of<br>\
what is allotted to one by means of the ازلام is<br>\
forbidden in the Kur v. 4. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,<br>\
أَزْلَامُ البَقَرَةِ (tropical:)  The legs of the [wild] ox or cow:<br>\
likened to the arrows called ازلام because of their<br>\
slenderness: or, accord. to the A, because of their<br>\
strength and hardness. (TA.) [Hence, likewise,]<br>\
the former of the two words (زَلَمٌ) signifies also<br>\
(assumed tropical:)  A strong and light or active boy: pl. as above:<br>\
(TA:) [app. because] a poet likens [such] a boy<br>\
to an arrow of the kind thus called. (S, TA. *)<br>\
-A2-  Also, both words, (K,) the latter on the authority of Kr, (TA,) A cloven hoof: (K:) accord.<br>\
to some, peculiarly of the ox-kind: (TA:) or the<br>\
[projecting] thing that is behind it: (S, K:) pl.<br>\
as above. (K, * TA.)<br>\
-A3-  And the latter of the<br>\
same two words, (AA, S,) or each of them, (K,)<br>\
[The hyrax Syriacus;] one of the [animals<br>\
called] وِبَار [pl. of وَبْرٌ]: pl. as above. (AA, S, K.)<br>\
زُلَمٌ: see the next preceding paragraph, throughout.<br>\
هُوَالعَبْدُ زَلْمَةً and ↓ زُلْمَةً and ↓ زَلَمَةً and ↓ زُلَمَةً,<br>\

K,) and also with ن in the place of the ل, (S<br>\
and K in art. زنم) (assumed tropical:)  He is one whose proportion,<br>\
or conformation, (S, K,) or whose cut, (K,) is<br>\
that of the slave: (S, K:) or he is the slave in<br>\
truth: (Ks, S:) or he resembles the slave as<br>\
though he were he: (Lh, K:) it is as though one<br>\
said, ↓ هو العبد مَزْلُومًا, i. e. he is the slave, being<br>\
thus created by God, so that every one who looks<br>\
at him sees the characteristics of the slaves impressed upon him: and it is a prov. applied to<br>\
him who is low, ignoble, or mean: (Meyd:)<br>\
[i. e.,] one says thus in disapproval (فى النكرة<br>\
[i. e. فِى النَّكَرَةِ] or فى النَّكِرَةِ): (Lh: so in different<br>\
copies of the S:) and in like manner one says of<br>\
the female slave [هِىَ الأَمَةُ زَلْمَةً &amp;c.]: (Lh, S, K:)<br>\
As said, هُوَ العَبْدُ زَلْمَةُ, using the nom. case, without tenween; but IAar said, هو العبد زَلْمَةً, using<br>\
the accus. case, with tenween: so in the handwriting of &#39;Abd-Es-Selám El-Basree: (TA:) and<br>\
accord. to Lh, one says, يَا فَتَى ↓ هٰذَا العَبْدُ زَلْمًا,<br>\
(so in some copies of the S,) or ↓ زُلْمًا, (so in other<br>\
copies of the S, and in the TA,) with damm,<br>\
(TA,) meaning (assumed tropical:)  This is the slave in proportion,<br>\
or conformation, and in cut, O young man: (S,<br>\
TA:) or, as some say, the meaning is, truly.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
زُلْمَة: see the next preceding paragraph.<br>\
زَلَمَةٌ [A kind of wattle]: زَلَمَتَا العَنْزِ means the<br>\
زَنَمَتَانِ of the she-goat: (K:) or, accord. to Kh,<br>\
زَلَمَةٌ signifies a certain appertenance of goats; a<br>\
thing hanging from their حُلُوق [here meaning<br>\
throats, externally,] like the [kind of ear-ring<br>\
called] قُرْط; the animal having two of such things:<br>\
if an appertenance of the ear, it is called زَنَمَةٌ,<br>\
[q. v.,] with ن. (S, TA.) See also أَزْلَمُ.<br>\

(TA,) Having the end of the ear cut, (A&#39;Obeyd, K,)<br>\
a [portion termed] ↓ زَلَمَة or زَنَمَة being left [hanging]<br>\
to it: (A&#39;Obeyd, TA:) this is done only to camels<br>\
of generous race, (A&#39;Obeyd, K,) and to sheep or<br>\
goats: the fem. of the first is زَلْمَآءُ: (K:) [see also<br>\
زَنِمٌ: or] أَزْلَمُ, fem. as above, is applied to a goat,<br>\
as meaning having what are termed زَلَمَتَانِ [dual<br>\
of زَلَمَةٌ expl. above]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  الأَزْلَمُ الجَدَعُ signifies The mountain-goat; (K;) agreeably with the<br>\
original meaning; (TA;) and so ↓ المُزَلَّمُ: (K:<br>\
[in the CK, وَ is erroneously omitted between the<br>\
words الوَعِلُ and الصَّغِيرُ الجُثَّةِ:]) and الزَّلْمَآءُ signifies The female mountain-goat. (Kr, K.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
also, i. e. الازلم الجذع, (K,) because it is [as<br>\
though it were] always جَذَع, not becoming old,<br>\
(TA,) (tropical:)  Time, or fortune, (S, K,) that is hard, or<br>\
rigorous, (K,) in its course, (TA,) abounding<br>\
with trials (K) and deaths: accord. to Yaakoob,<br>\

it. (TA.) They said, أَوْدَى بِهِ الأَزْلَمُ الجَذَعُ and<br>\
الأَزْنَمُ الجَذَعُ, [q. v.] i. e. (assumed tropical:)  Time, or fortune,<br>\
[&amp;c.,] destroyed it; relating to a thing that has<br>\
gone, and passed, and of which one has despaired.<br>\
(TA.) [See also art. جذع.] ―<br>\

مُزَلَّمٌ, applied to an arrow, (S, K, TA,) like<br>\
↓ زَلِيمٌ, (S, K,) Cut [or pared], (ISk, S,) and<br>\
made good in its proportion or conformation, and<br>\

the former, with ة, applied to a staff (عَصًا). (S.)<br>\
