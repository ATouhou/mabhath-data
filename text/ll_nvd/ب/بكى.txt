بَكَى, aor.<br>\
بَكِىَ, (Msb, K,) inf. n. بُكَآءٌ and بُكًا<br>\
(S, Msb, K) and مَبْكًى, (Har p. 11,) He wept;<br>\
i. e. he lamented, or grieved, shedding tears at the<br>\
same time; and he lamented, or grieved, alone;<br>\
and he shed tears alone: (Er-Rághib, TA:)<br>\
accord. to some, the preferable opinion is, that<br>\
there is no difference between بُكَآءُ and بُكًا: (TA:)<br>\
or the former means the crying, or uttering of<br>\
the voice [of lamentation], (S, IKtt, Msb, TA,<br>\
&amp;c.,) that accompanies البُكَآء [so in copies of the<br>\
S and in the TA, but correctly البُكَا]; (S, IKtt,<br>\
TA;) and the latter (بُكًا), the shedding of tears:<br>\
(S, IKtt, Msb, TA, &amp;c.:) or the former, i. e. with<br>\
medd, means the shedding of tears by reason of<br>\
lamentation, or grief, and raising of the voice,<br>\
or crying, [at the same time,] when the voice is<br>\
predominant, being like رُغَآءٌ, and ثُغَآءٌ and other<br>\
words of the same form applied to denote the<br>\
uttering of a cry or of the voice; and the latter,<br>\
[the shedding of tears &amp;c.] when lamentation,<br>\
or grief, is predominant: (Er-Rághib, TA:) or<br>\
by the former is meant the crying, or uttering<br>\
of the voice [of lamentation]; and by the latter,<br>\
the lamenting, or grieving. (Kh, TA.) تَبْكَآءٌ and<br>\
تِبْكَآءٌ [may be inf. ns. of بَكَى or of ↓ بَكَّى, and]<br>\
signify the same as بُكَآءٌ: or much بُكَاء [or weeping,<br>\
&amp;c.]: (K:) MF asserts that تِبْكَآءٌ (with kesr) and<br>\
the former of these explanations are unknown;<br>\
but both the word and the explanation are mentioned by Lh, as used in a form of words uttered<br>\
by Arab women of the desert to fascinate men:<br>\
ISd, however, says that it should be تَبْكَآء, because<br>\
it is an inf. n. of a class formed to denote muchness [of the attribute signified by the verb], like<br>\
تَهْذَارٌ and تَلْعَابٌ &amp;c.; and IAar says that تَبْكَاءٌ,<br>\
with fet-h, has the latter of the two significations<br>\
assigned to it above. (TA.) [See what is said<br>\
of the measure تِفْعَالٌ voce بَيَّنَ.] You say, بَكَى لَهُ<br>\
(MF, TA) and بَكَى عَلَيْهِ, (S, Msb, K, MF,)<br>\
meaning [He wept] for, or over, him, or it: and<br>\
only بَكَى بِهِ [or thus and also بَكَىمِنْهُ as appears<br>\
from what follows] when meaning [He wept]<br>\
because, or in consequence, of it: (&#39;Ináyeh, MF,<br>\
TA:) and بَكَاهُ and ↓ بَكَّاهُ, (As, AZ, S, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. of the former بُكَآءٌ (K) [and بُكًا], and of<br>\
the latter تَبْكِيَةٌ, (TA,) signify the same as بَكَى<br>\
عَلَيْهِ; (As, AZ, S, Msb, * K;) the object being a<br>\
man: (As, S:) and (or as some say, TA) he wept<br>\
for, or over, him, i. e., one dead; or did so, and<br>\
enumerated his good qualities or actions; syn.<br>\
رَثَاهُ: (K:) or, as some say, بَكَاهُ means [he wept<br>\
because, or in consequence, of it, i. e.,] on account<br>\
of being pained: and بَكَى عَلَيْهِ, [he wept for, or<br>\
over, him,] by reason of tenderness of heart, or<br>\
compassion: and [hence] it is said that بَكَيْتُهُ is<br>\
originally بَكَيْتُ مِنْهُ: (TA:) [and ↓ بَكَّاهُ may<br>\
have an intensive, or a frequentative, meaning;<br>\
for it is said that] بَكِّى, addressed to the eye,<br>\
signifies weep thou much, and repeatedly. (Ham<br>\
p. 461.) ―<br>\
-b2- [Hence,] بَكَت السَّحَابَةُ (assumed tropical:)  The cloud<br>\
rained. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b3-  بَكَى also means He sang:<br>\
[in the CK, وبَكَى عَنِّى is erroneously put for<br>\
وبَكَى غَنَّى:] thus it has two contr. significations:<br>\
(K, TA:) accord. to MF, it has this meaning<br>\
only in relation to the pigeon and the like; but<br>\
it is also used in this sense when said of a man,<br>\
as in a verse cited voce جَنَازَةٌ, q. v. : and he<br>\
observes that the assertion of its having two contr<br>\
significations requires consideration, seeing that<br>\
it is also said to signify رَثَى; [for in the performance of رِثَآء, it is a common practice to sing;] but<br>\
رِثَآء is generally accompanied by lamentation, and<br>\
غِنَآء by rejoicing. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  بَاكَيْتُهُ فَبَكَيْتُهُ: see 3.<br>\

-A2-  and see also 4.<br>\
3<br>\
بَاكَيْتُهُ فَبَكَيْتُهُ, (S, TA,) aor. of the latter<br>\
أَبْكُوهُ, (TA,) or أَبْكِيهِ, retaining its original form,<br>\
accord. to a rule observed in the case of a verb<br>\
having an infirm letter [for its second or third<br>\
radical] lest a verb with a radical ى should be<br>\
confounded with one having a radical و, (Ham<br>\
p. 670,) i. e. [I vied with him, or strove to exceed<br>\
him, in weeping, and I exceeded him therein, or]<br>\
I was a greater weeper (أَبْكَى) than he. (S, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
ابكاهُ [He made him, or caused him, to weep;<br>\
or] he did to him what made him to weep; (S,<br>\
K;) as also ↓ استبكاهُ. (S.) And عَلَيْهِ ↓ بكّاهُ,<br>\
inf. n. تَبْكِيَةٌ, He excited him to weep for him, or<br>\
it; (K, TA;) namely, a person dead, (K,) or a<br>\
thing lost. (TA.)<br>\
6<br>\
تباكى signifies تَكَلَّفَ البُكَآءَ [i. e. He affected<br>\
weeping; or endeavoured, or constrained himself,<br>\
to weep]. (S, K.) Hence, in a trad., فَإِنْ لَمْ<br>\
تَجِدُوا بُكَآءً فَتَبَاكَوْا [And if ye experience not<br>\
weeping, endeavour to weep]: (TA:) [or the<br>\
words of the trad. are] اُتْلُوا القُرْآنَ وَابْكُوا فَإِنْ لَمْ<br>\
تَبْكُوا فَتَبَاكَوْا [Peruse ye the Kur-án, and weep;<br>\
or, if ye weep not, endeavour to do so]. (Bd in<br>\
xix. 59.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And He feigned, or made a show of,<br>\
weeping. (Har p. 602.)<br>\
10<br>\
استبكاهُ: see 4. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He desired, or required, of him weeping. (TA.)<br>\
بَكِىٌّ One who weeps much; (S, K;) as also<br>\
↓ بَكَّآءٌ. (K, but omitted in some copies and in the<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  رَجُلٌ عَيِيٌّ بَكِىٌّ, A man unable to speak.<br>\
(Mbr, TA.) [But perhaps this should be بَكِىْءٌ:<br>\
see art. بكأ.]<br>\
بَكَّآءٌ: see بَكِىٌّ.<br>\
بَاكٍ part. n. of بَكَى [i. e. Weeping, &amp;c.]: (K:)<br>\
pl. بُكِىٌّ, (S, K,) of the measure فُعُولٌ, with the و<br>\
changed into ى [and the second dammeh consequently into a kesreh, wherefore it is also, sometimes, pronounced بِكِىٌّ], (S,) and بُكَاةٌ, (K,) which<br>\
is agreeable with analogy and usage, though said<br>\
by Es-Semeen to have not been heard. (TA.)<br>\
[The pl. of the fem., i. e. of بَاكِيَةٌ, is بَاكِيَاتٌ and<br>\
بَوَاكٍ.]<br>\
أَبْكَى [A greater weeper, or one who weeps<br>\
more, than another: see 3]. (S, TA.)<br>\
