of بَرَاجِمُ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and بُرْجُمَاتٌ; (T,<br>\
TA;) and signifies [A knuckle, or finger-joint;]<br>\
the outer, or the inner, joint, or place of division,<br>\
of the fingers: and (as some say, TA) the middle<br>\
toe of any bird: (K:) or بَرَاجِمُ signifies all the<br>\
finger-joints; (A&#39;Obeyd, K;) as also رَوَاجِمُ [a<br>\
mistranscription for رَوَاجِب]: (A&#39;Obeyd, TA:)<br>\
or the parts of the fingers that are protuberant<br>\
when one clinches his hand: (Ham ubi suprà:)<br>\
or the backs of the finger-bones: (K:) or the<br>\
finger-joints (S, Mgh) that are between the أَشَاجِع<br>\
and the رَوَاجِب; (S;) i. e. (S, Mgh) [the middle<br>\
knuckles; (see أَشْجَعُ and رَاجِبَةٌ;)] the heads of<br>\
the سُلَامَيَات, (S, Mgh, Msb, K,) on the back, or<br>\
outer side, of the hand, (S, Msb,) which become<br>\
protuberant when one clinches his hand: (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K:) or, as in the Kf, the heads of the<br>\
سلاميات; and their inner and outer sides are<br>\
termed the رَوَاجِب: (Msb:) accord. to the T,<br>\
the wrinkled parts at the joints of the fingers;<br>\
the smooth portion between which is called رَاجِبَةٌ:<br>\
or, as in another place, in the backs of the fingers;<br>\
the parts between them being called the رَوَاجِب:<br>\
in every finger are three بُرْجُمَات, except the<br>\
thumb: or, as in another place, in every finger<br>\
are two of what are thus termed: it is also explained as signifying the joints in the backs of<br>\
the fingers, upon which the dirt collects. (TA.)<br>\
The phrase الأَخْذُ بِالبَرَاجِمِ, meaning The seizing<br>\
with the hand, is one requiring consideration [as<br>\
of doubtful character]. (Mgh.) [See also بُرْثُنٌ.]<br>\
