بَاحَ, (A, Msb, K,) aor. يَبُوحُ, (Msb,) inf. n.<br>\
بَوْحٌ, (A, Msb,) It (a secret, A, or a thing, Msb)<br>\
became apparent, or manifest. (A, Msb, K.) You<br>\
say, بَاحَ مَا كَتَبْتُ [What I concealed became<br>\
apparent]. (A.) And أَعُوذُ بِاللّٰهِ مشنْ بَوْحِ السِّرِّ<br>\
وَكَشْفِ السِّتْرِ [I seek protection by God from the<br>\
appearing of the secret, and the removing of the<br>\
veil, or covering]. (A.)<br>\
-A2-  بَاحَ بِهِ, (S, A, Msb,<br>\
K,) [aor. as above,] inf. n. بَوْحٌ and بُؤُوحٌ and<br>\
بُؤُوحَةٌ, (K, TA,) He revealed, or disclosed, it;<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K;) namely, a secret, (S, A, K,) or<br>\
a thing; (Msb;) as also ↓ اباحهُ. (A, Msb, K.)<br>\
It (the former) is said to be from ↓ الإِبَاحَهُ [the<br>\
inf. n. of the latter] signifying The showing a<br>\
thing to the beholder in order that he who will<br>\
may take it. (TA.) You say, سِرًّا فَبَاحَ بِهِ ↓ أَبَاحَهُ<br>\
He revealed to him a secret, and he (the latter)<br>\
[revealed it, i. e.,] did not conceal it. (TA.)<br>\
And بُحْ بِاسْمِكَ وَ لَا تَكْنِ عَنْهُ [Reveal thou thy<br>\
name, and make not a mere allusion to it]. (A.)<br>\
4<br>\
اباح, inf. n. إِبَاحَةٌ: see 1, in three places. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
إِبَاحَةٌ and ↓ اِسْتِبَاحَةٌ are used as syn.: but it is<br>\
said that the former signifies The making a thing<br>\
allowable, or free, to him who desires it, or seeks<br>\
it: and the latter, the taking a thing as allowed,<br>\
allowable, free, or lawful. (MF.) You say, اباح<br>\
الشَّىْءَ He made the thing allowable, or free. (L.)<br>\
And اباح مَالَهُ He gave permission either to take<br>\
or let alone his property; made it allowable, or<br>\
free, either way one might choose to take. (Msb.)<br>\
And أَبَحْتُكَ الشَّىْءَ I made, or have made, the<br>\
thing allowable, free, or lawful, to thee, (S, L, K,<br>\
TA,) to take it, [or let it alone,] or do it, [or<br>\
make use of it,] or possess it; but not by the law<br>\
of the religion, for to do this belongs to God and<br>\
his apostle; except in the language of this law.<br>\
(MF, TA.) [Hence it is said that] إِبَاحَةٌ bears a<br>\
signification similar to that of نُهْبَى [i. e. Spoliation; a taking of spoil; or the taking a thing<br>\
as spoil; a signification more properly belonging<br>\
to the inf. n. of 10, q. v.]. (L.)<br>\
10<br>\
استباحهُ He deemed it, or esteemed it, to<br>\
be allowed, allowable, free, or lawful; namely,<br>\
the property of another: (A:) or he took it as<br>\
allowed, allowable, &amp;c. (A, * MF.) See 4. ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
He took it as spoil, or plunder. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  He<br>\
made an attack upon it; namely, the property of<br>\
another. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b4-  He took him captive, making<br>\
him as a lawful possession to him. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b5-<br>\
And اِسْتَبَاحَهُمْ, (K,) or اِسْتَبَاحُوهُمْ, (S,) He, or<br>\
they, extirpated, or exterminated, them. (S, K.)<br>\
بُوحٌ has the following various significations<br>\
assigned to it in explanations of the saying, اِبْنُكَ<br>\
ابْنُ بُوحِكَ يَشْرَبُ مِنْ صَبُوحِكَ: (S, TA:) The<br>\
penis: (S, K, Har p. 336:) the فَرْج [or pudendum, app. meaning, of a woman]: (K, Har<br>\
p. 328 on the authority of AO:) the نَفْس [meaning one&#39;s self]: (IAar, T, S, Meyd, L:) coitus;<br>\
syn. وَطْءٌ (S) or جِمَاعٌ: (K:) and accord. to the last<br>\
but one of these renderings, [and virtually accord.<br>\
to the others also,] the saying means Thy son is<br>\
the son of thyself, [who drinks of thy morningdraught]; (T, TA;) he whom thou hast begotten,<br>\
not he whom thou hast adopted: (IAar, and Mtr<br>\
in Har p. 328:) or بوح, here, is pl. of بَاحَةٌ; (A,<br>\
TA, Har p. 336;) and the meaning is, he who<br>\
has been born within the courts of thy house;<br>\
(A;) or, in the court of thy house, (TA, Har,)<br>\
not in the house of another: (TA:) or بوح is<br>\
here a subst. from بَاحَ الشَّىْءِ; and the meaning<br>\
is, thy son is he whom thou hast openly acknowledged (بُحْتَ بِهِ), and whom his mother hath<br>\
also, agreeably with thee: (Har p. 328:) [accord.<br>\
to some,] it signifies also i. q. أَصْلٌ [i. e. origin;<br>\
or race, or stock, which it may mean in the saying<br>\
above: or original, or primary, state, or condition];<br>\
(K, Har p. 328;) [for] one says, رَجَعَ إِلَى بُوحِهِ<br>\
[He returned, or reverted, to his original, or<br>\
primary, state, or condition]. (Har p. 328.)<br>\
بَاحَةٌ The court; or a spacious vacant part, or<br>\
portion, in which is no building; syn. سَاحَةٌ, (S<br>\
A, K,) and عَرْصَةٌ; (A, TA;) of a house or dwelling: (S, TA:) pl. بُوحٌ [q. v.]. (A, TA.) Hence<br>\
[is said to be derived] بُحْبُوحَةُ الدَّارِ [mentioned in<br>\
art. بح]. (TA.) One says also, نَحْنُ فِى بَاحَةِ الدَّارِ,<br>\
meaning We are in the middle, or midst, or best<br>\
part, of the abode, or district, or country; i. e.<br>\
أَوْسَطِهَا. (TA.) And hence, accord. to Fr, تَبَحْبَحَ<br>\
[explained in art. بح]. (Az, TA.) It is said in<br>\
a trad., لَيْسَ لِلنِّسَآءِ مِنْ بَاحَةِ الطَّرِيقِ شَىْءْ, meaning<br>\
[Women have no right] in the middle of the road.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The main part or body of water:<br>\
(K:) applied by most of the lexicologists to the<br>\
sea. (TA.) [In the present day applied to A<br>\
deep part of the sea, distant from land; the<br>\
deep; the main, or main sea.] ―<br>\
-b3-  And Many<br>\
palm-trees. (Aboo-Sárim El-Bahdalee, IAar, K.)<br>\
أَمَرَهُ بِمَعْصِيَةٍ بَوَاحًا He ordered him to disobey,<br>\
or rebel, openly. (K.) The last word occurs in<br>\
this sense in two trads.; but in one of them,<br>\
accord. to one recital, it is بَرَاحًا. (TA.)<br>\
هُوَ بَؤُوحٌ بِمَا فِى صَدْرِهِ He is one who reveals,<br>\
or discloses, what is in his bosom; as also بَيْحَانٌ<br>\
and بَيَّحَانٌ; (K;) the ى being originally و.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
مُبَاحٌ Allowed or allowable [to be taken, or let<br>\
alone, or done, or made use of, or possessed;<br>\
see 4]; made allowable, free, or lawful; contr.<br>\
of مَحْظُورٌ. (S, A.)<br>\
