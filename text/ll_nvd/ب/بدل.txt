بَدَلَ, inf. n. بَدَالٌ: see 2, in three places.<br>\
2<br>\
تَبْدِيلٌ properly signifies [The changing, or<br>\
altering, a thing; or] the changing, or altering,<br>\
the form, or fashion, or semblance, or the quality,<br>\
or condition, [of a thing,] to another form, &amp;c.,<br>\
while the substance remains the same; (Th, T,<br>\
TA;) or the changing a thing from its state, or<br>\
condition; (Ibn-&#39;Arafeh, TA;) or the changing<br>\
a thing without substitution: (S:) but the Arabs<br>\
have used it also in the sense of ↓ إِبْدَالٌ, (Mbr,<br>\
T, TA,) which signifies [the changing a thing by<br>\
substitution; exchanging it; replacing it with<br>\
another thing; or] the removing, or displacing,<br>\
the substance [of a thing], and introducing anew<br>\
another substance. (Th, T, TA.) You say, بَدَّلْتُهُ,<br>\
inf. n. تَبْدِيلٌ, (M, * Msb, K,) meaning I changed<br>\
it, or altered it; (M, K) or I changed, or<br>\
altered, the form, or fashion, or semblance, or<br>\
the quality, or condition, of it; (Msb;) as in<br>\
the phrase, بَدَّلْتُ الخَاتَمَ بِالحَلْقَةِ [I changed, or<br>\
altered, the signet-ring into the simple ring], said<br>\
when one has melted the former and made of<br>\
it a simple ring; (Fr, T, TA;) and بَدَّلَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
السَّيِئَّاتِ حَسَنَاتٍ [God changed the evil deeds into<br>\
good deeds]; the verb being doubly trans. by<br>\
itself because it has the meaning of جَعَلَ and<br>\
صَيَّرَ. (Msb. [But see what follows.]) ↓ أَبْدَلْتُهُ<br>\
بِكَذَا, [in the S, أَبْدَلْتُ الشَّىْءَ بِغَيْرِهِ, without explanation,] inf. n. إِبْدَالٌ, [I changed it by substituting for it such a thing, or exchanged it for<br>\
such a thing, or replaced it with such a thing,]<br>\
is said when one has removed the first, and put<br>\
the second in its place; (Msb;) as in the phrase,<br>\
أَبْدَلْتُ الخَاتَمَ بِالحَلْقَةِ [I changed the signet-ring<br>\
by substituting for it the simple ring; exchanged<br>\
the signet-ring for the simple ring; or replaced<br>\
the signet-ring with the simple ring]; said when<br>\
one removes the one, and puts the other in its<br>\
place: (Fr, T, TA:) and this verb is also made<br>\
doubly trans. by itself, like بَدَّلْتُ, (Msb,) which<br>\
is used in the sense of أَبْدَلْتُ [as shown above];<br>\
(Mbr, T, TA;) for instance, where it is said, [in<br>\
the Kur lxvi. 5,] عَسَى رَبُّهُ إِنْ طَلَّقَكُنَّ أَنْ يُبْدِلَهُ<br>\
أَزْوَجًا خَيْرًا مِنْكُنَّ [May-be, his Lord, if he divorce<br>\
you, will give him in exchange wives better than<br>\
you]; accord to one reading, يُبَدِّلَهُ (Msb.) An<br>\
ex. of the latter of these two verbs in the sense<br>\
of the former is the saying in the Kur [xxv. 70],<br>\
يُبَدِّلُ اللّٰهُ سَيِّآتِهِمْ حَسَنَاتٍ [God will change their<br>\
evil deeds by substituting for them good deeds];<br>\
i. e. will cancel the evil deeds and put in their<br>\
place good deeds: but in the saying in the Kur<br>\
[iv. 59], كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُمْ بَدَّلْنَاهُمْ جُلُودًا<br>\
غَيْرَهَا [Whenever their skins are thoroughly burned,<br>\
we will change the condition thereof to them into<br>\
the condition of other skins], the meaning is, that<br>\
the first condition of their skins shall be restored;<br>\
so that the substance is one, but the condition is<br>\
different. (Mbr, T, TA.) You say also, بَدَّلَهُ اللّٰهُ<br>\
مَنَ الخَوْفِ أَمْنًا [God gave him in exchange for<br>\
fear, or in lieu of fear, security]. (S.) [And<br>\
بَدَّلَهُ بِهِ كَذَا He gave him in exchange for it,<br>\
or in lieu of it, such a thing: see Kur xxxiv. 15.<br>\
And بدّل مَكَانَهُ كَذَا He gave in exchange for it,<br>\
or in lieu of it, such a thing: see Kur vii. 93<br>\
and xvi. 103.] بَدَّلَ حُسْنًا بَعْدَ سُوْءٍ, in the Kur<br>\
[xxvii. 11], means He hath done good [by way<br>\
of exchange after evil]; i. e., repented; (Jel;)<br>\
or بَدَّلَ ذَنْبُهُ بِالتَوْبَةِ [hath exchanged his sin for<br>\
repentance]. (Bd.) تَبْدِيلٌ and ↓ إِبْدَالٌ both<br>\
signify The act of exchanging [a thing for another<br>\
thing]; or making [a thing] to be a substitute<br>\
[for another thing]; (KL, PS;) and so does<br>\
↓ بَدَالٌ. (KL.) You say, بدّل الشَّىْءَ مِنَ الشَىْءِ,<br>\
(M, K, *) and مِنْهُ ↓ ابدلهُ, i. e. اِتَّخَذَهُ مِنْهُ بَدلًا<br>\
[here meaning He exchanged the thing for the<br>\
thing; or, more literally, he made the thing a<br>\
substitute for the thing]. (M, K. [In the text<br>\
of the former of these, as given in the TT, instead<br>\
of اِتَّخَذَهُ, I find تَخِذَ (a dial. var. of اِتَّخَذَ) without the affixed pronoun, which is meant to be<br>\
understood or is omitted inadvertently by the<br>\
transcriber: and here it should be observed, that<br>\
the explanation which I have rendered as above<br>\
admits of another meaning, namely, أَخَذَهُ مِنْهُ بَدَلًا<br>\
“he took it as a substitute for it:” in the M,<br>\
immediately before, أَخَذَهُ مِنْهُ بَدَلًا is given as the<br>\
explanation of the phrases تبدّل الشَّىْءَ and بِالشَّىْءِ,<br>\
and استبدلهُ and بِهِ: see 10.]) You say also,<br>\
الثَّوْبَ بِغَيْرِهِ ↓ بَدَلْتُ, aor.<br>\
بَدُلَ, [inf. n. بَدَالٌ, mentioned and explained above, I exchanged the garment, or piece of cloth, for another; or made it<br>\
to be a substitute for another;] and ↓ اِسْتَبْدَلْتُهُ<br>\
بِغَيْرِهِ signifies the same. (Msb. [But the latter<br>\
phrase has more frequently another meaning, explained below: see 10.]) [↓ ابدلهُ in the phrases<br>\
ابدلهُ كَذَا as meaning He changed it into, or<br>\
substituted for it, such a thing, and ابدلهُ مِنْ كَذَا<br>\
as meaning he changed it from, or substituted it<br>\
for, such a thing, is more common than بدّله,<br>\
which is used in the same sense; as ↓ بَدَلَهُ is<br>\
also; for] AO applies the term ↓ مَبْدُولٌ [in lieu<br>\
of the more common term ↓ مُبْدَلٌ] to a letter<br>\
that is changed from another letter, as in مَدَهْتُهُ<br>\
for مَدَحْتُهُ; and this shows that بَدَلْتُ is trans.<br>\
[and signifies I changed, &amp;c.]. (Az, TA.)<br>\
3<br>\
مُبَادَلَةٌ and ↓ تَبَادَلٌ signify the same, (S,)<br>\
namely, The act of exchanging with another or<br>\
others. (PS.) You say, بادلهُ, inf. n. مُبَادَلَةٌ and<br>\
بِدَالٌ [in the CK erroneously written with fet-h<br>\
to the ب], He exchanged, or made an exchange,<br>\
with him; or] he gave him the like of that which<br>\
he took, or received, from him; (IDrd, * M, K;)<br>\
for instance, a garment, or piece of cloth, in the<br>\
place of another; (Lth, T, Msb, * in explanation<br>\
of the former inf. n.;) and a brother in the place<br>\
of a brother. (Lth, T.) And ↓ تَبَادَلَا They exchanged, or made an exchange, each with the<br>\
other; or each gave to the other the like of that<br>\
which he took, or received, from him. (TA.)<br>\
نُبَادِلُهْ, ending a verse of El-Kulákh, means for<br>\
whom we would take a substitute: El-Marzookee<br>\
says, it is for نُبَادِلُ بِهِ النَّاسَ [for whom we would<br>\
make an exchange with the people]; the preposition being suppressed. (Ham p. 465.)<br>\
4<br>\
ابدلهُ, inf. n. إِبْدَالٌ: see 2, in five places.<br>\
5<br>\
تبدّل It (a thing, M) became changed, or<br>\
altered. (M, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  In the saying of the rájiz,<br>\
فَبُدِّلَتْ وَالدَّهْرُ ذُو تَبَدُّلِ<br>\
the meaning is, ذو تَبْدِيل [i. e. the meaning of<br>\
the whole is, And, or but, she was changed, or<br>\
altered; for time has the property of changing,<br>\
or altering]. (M.)<br>\
-A2-  See also 10, in three places.<br>\

تَبَاْدَلَ see 3, in two places.<br>\
10<br>\
استبدل الشَّىْءَ and<br>\
بِالشَّىْءِ, and ↓ تبدّلهُ and<br>\
بِهِ, (M, K, *) He took a substitute, or a thing in<br>\
exchange, for the thing. (M.) You say, استبدل<br>\
الشَّىْءَ بِغَيْرِهِ, and بِهِ ↓ تبدّلهُ, He took the thing [as<br>\
a substitute, or in exchange, for another; or] in<br>\
the place of another. (S.) And استبدل ثَوْبًا مَكَانَ<br>\
ثَوْبٍ [He took a garment, or piece of cloth, in the<br>\
place, or in lieu, of a garment, &amp;c.]; and أَخًا<br>\
مَكَانَ أَخٍ [a brother in the place, or in lieu, of a<br>\
brother]. (Lth, T.) It is said in the Kur [ii. 58],<br>\
أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ الَّذِى هُوَ أَدْنَى بِالَّذِى هُوَ خَيْرٌ Will ye<br>\
take in exchange that which is worse for that<br>\
which is better? (Jel. [See also other exs. in<br>\
the Kur ix. 39 and xlvii. last verse.]) And<br>\
الكُفْرَ بِالْإِيمَانِ ↓ مَنْ يَتَبَدَّلِ [Whoso adopteth infidelity in lieu of faith]. (Kur ii. 102. [See also<br>\
other exs. in the Kur iv. 2 and xxxiii. 52.]) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
See also 2, last sentence but one.<br>\
بِدْلٌ: see the next paragraph, in four places.<br>\
بَدَلٌ and ↓ بِدْلٌ, (Fr, T, S, M, Msb, K,) like<br>\
مَثَلٌ and مِثْلٌ, and شَبَهٌ and شِبْهٌ, (Fr, T, S,) and<br>\
نَكَلٌ and نِكَلٌ, the only other instances of the kind,<br>\
i. e. of words of both these measures, that have<br>\
been heard, accord. to AO, (S, TA, [but in one<br>\
copy of the S, I find A&#39;Obeyd,]) and ↓ بَدِيلٌ (S,<br>\
M, Mgh, Msb, K,) all signify the same; (S, M,<br>\
Msb, K;) namely, A substitute; a thing given,<br>\
or received, or put, or done, instead of, in place<br>\
of, in lieu of, or in exchange for, another thing;<br>\
a compensation; syn. خَلَفٌ, (M, K,) and عِوَضٌ:<br>\
(Kull:) بَدَلُ الشَّىْءِ [and البَدَلُ مِنَ الشَّىْءِ] and<br>\
↓ بِدْلُهُ ↓ بَدِيلُهُ meaning الخَلَفُ مِنْهُ [the substitute for the thing; &amp;c.]; (M, K;) i. e., another<br>\
thing: (S:) pl. أَبْدَالٌ, (IDrd, Msb, K,) which,<br>\
as pl. of ↓ بَدِيلٌ, has few parallels. (IDrd, TA.)<br>\
Sb says, [making a distinction between بَدَلٌ and<br>\
↓ بَدِيلٌ,] you say, إِنَّ بَدَلَكَ زَيْدٌ, i. e. Verily Zeyd<br>\
is in thy place: but if you put بَدَل in the place<br>\
of بَدِيلِ, you say, إِنَّ بَدَلَكَ زَيْدٌ, i. e. ↓ إِنَّ بِدَيلَكَ<br>\
زَيْدٌ [Verily thy substitute is Zeyd]: and a man<br>\
says to another, Go thou with such a one; and<br>\
he replies, مَعِىَ رَجُلٌ بَدَلُهُ, i. e. With me is a man<br>\
who stands in his stead, and is in his place, or<br>\
who will stand &amp;c. (M.) You say also, بَلَ كَذَا<br>\
[and بَدَلًا مِنْ كَذَا], meaning Instead of, in<br>\
the place of, in lieu of, or in exchange for,<br>\
such a thing. (Kull.) [And بَدَلَ أَنْ تَفْعَلَ كَذَا<br>\
Instead of thy doing thus.] ―<br>\
-b2-  الأَبْدَالُ (IDrd, S,<br>\
M, K, &amp;c.) and البُدَلَآءُ (TA) [The Substitutes, or<br>\
Lieutenants;] certain righteous persons, of whom<br>\
the world is never destitute; when one dies, God<br>\
substituting another in his place: (S:) certain<br>\
persons by means of whom God rules the earth;<br>\
(M, K;) consisting of seventy men, (IDrd, M,<br>\
K,) according to their assertion, of whom the<br>\
earth is never destitute; (IDrd, TA;) forty of<br>\
whom are in Syria, and thirty in the other<br>\
countries; (IDrd, M, K;) none of them dying<br>\
without another&#39;s supplying his place, (M, K,)<br>\
from the rest of mankind; (K;) and therefore<br>\
they are named ابدال: (M:) accord. to Abu-lBakà, as stated by El-Munáwee, it seems that<br>\
they meant [by this appellation] the substitutes<br>\
and successors of the prophets; and accord. to<br>\
some, they were seven, neither more nor fewer,<br>\
by means of whom God takes care of the seven<br>\
climates; one being successor of Abraham (ElKhaleel), and to him pertains the first climate;<br>\
the second, of Moses (El-Keleem); the third, of<br>\
Aaron; the fourth, of Idrees; the fifth, of<br>\
Joseph; the sixth, of Jesus; and the seventh, of<br>\
Adam: (TA: [in which is also mentioned a<br>\
treatise denying their existence, and disapproving<br>\
of the assertion that by means of them God takes<br>\
care of the earth:]) the sing. is بَدَلٌ and ↓ بِدْلٌ,<br>\
(T,) or ↓ بَدِيلٌ. (IDrd, S.) ―<br>\
-b3-  حُرُوفُ البَدَلِ (M,<br>\
K) The letters of substitution; those which are<br>\
substituted for other letters; not those which are<br>\
substituted in consequence of idghám. (M.) [The<br>\
letters included under this appellation differ accord.<br>\
to different authors: see De Sacy&#39;s Gram. Ar.<br>\
2nd ed. i. 33.] ―<br>\
-b4-  ↓ بِدْلٌ (Kr, M, K) and بَدَلٌ<br>\
(M, K,) applied to a man, also signify Generous,<br>\
and noble: (Kr, * M, K:) and used in these<br>\
senses, [says ISd,] they are, in my opinion, not<br>\
devoid of implication of the meaning of a substitute: (M:) the pl. is أَبْدَالٌ (M, K.)<br>\
بَدِيلٌ: see بَدَلٌ, in six places<br>\
بَدَّالٌ A seller of eatables (A Heyth, T, K) of<br>\
every kind: thus he is called by the Arabs;<br>\
(A Heyth, T;) because he changes one sale for<br>\
another; selling one thing to-day and another<br>\
to-morrow: (AHát, TA:) the vulgar say, بَقَّالٌ.<br>\
(A Heyth, T, K.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also One who has no more<br>\
property than is sufficient for his purchasing one<br>\
thing, and who, when he sells this, buys another<br>\
thing in exchange for it. (TA in art. جدل.)<br>\
[Hence,] هٰذَا رَأْىُ الجَدَّالِينَ وَالبَدَّالِينَ is a phrase<br>\
used as meaning This is flimsy opinion. (TA<br>\
in the present art. and in art. جدل, [but in the<br>\
latter without the و,] on the authority of AHeyth.)<br>\
