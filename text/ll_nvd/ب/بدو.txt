بَدَا, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) aor. يَبْدُو, (S, Msb,)<br>\
inf. n. بُدُوٌّ (S, M, Msb, K) and بَدْوٌ and بَدَآءٌ<br>\
(M, K) and بَدَآءَةٌ (K) and بَدًا, (M, on the<br>\
authority of Sb,) for which last we find, in [some<br>\
of] the copies of the K, بُدُوٌّ, a repetition, (TA,)<br>\
or بُدُوْءٌ, (so in other copies of the K,) It<br>\
appeared; it became apparent, open, manifest,<br>\
plain, or evident: (T, S, M, Msb, K:) and ↓ تبدّى<br>\
[signifies the same; or he showed himself, or it<br>\
showed itself; (see an ex. in art. جيش, voce<br>\
جَاشَ, last sentence;) or] he, or it, came in sight,<br>\
or within sight. (KL.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَدَا لَهُ فِى الأَمْرِ, (T,<br>\
M, Msb, K, and Har p. 665,) inf. n. بَدْوٌ (M, K)<br>\
and بَدًا (M, and so in a copy of the K) and بَدَآءٌ,<br>\
(T, M, and so in the CK,) or بَدَآءَةٌ and بَدَاةٌ; (as<br>\
in some copies of the K;) or ↓ بَدَا لَهُ فِى الأَمْرِ بَدَآءٌ,<br>\
(S, IB,) the last word being in the nom. case<br>\
because it is the agent; (IB, TA;) An opinion<br>\
presented itself, or occurred, to him, or arose in<br>\
his mind, syn. نَشَأَ, (S, K, and Har ubi suprà,)<br>\
or appeared to him, (M,) [respecting the affair,<br>\
or case,] different from his first opinion, so that<br>\
it turned him therefrom: (Har ubi suprà:) or<br>\
there appeared to him, respecting the affair, or<br>\
case, what did not appear at first: (Msb:) accord. to Fr, ↓ بَدَا لِى بَدَآءٌ means another opinion<br>\
appeared to me: accord. to Az, بَدَا لِى بَدًا means<br>\
my opinion changed from what it was. (TA.)<br>\
Esh-Shemmàkh says,<br>\
لَعَلَّكَ وَ المَوْعُودُ حَقٌّ وَفَاؤُهُ<br>\
بَدَا لَكَ فِى تِلْكَ القَلُوصِ بَدَآءُ<br>\
[May-be (but it is right that the promise be fulfilled) an opinion different from thy first opinion<br>\
hath arisen in thy mind respecting that youthful<br>\
she-camel]. (M, TA.) ثُمَّ بَدَا لَهُمْ مِنْ بَعْدِ مَا رَأَوُا<br>\
الْآيَاتِ لَيَسْجُنَنَّهُ, in the Kur [xii.35], means بَدَا<br>\
وَقَالُوا لَيَسْجُنُنَّهُ ↓ لَهُمْ بَدَآءٌ, [i.e. Then an opinion<br>\
arose in their minds, after they had seen the signs<br>\
of his innocence, and they said that they should<br>\
certainly imprison him,] because ليسجننّه, being<br>\
a proposition, cannot be the agent: so says Sb.<br>\
(M.) بَدَا لِلّهِ أَنْ يَقْتُلَهُمْ, occurring in a trad.,<br>\
means (tropical:)  God determined that He would slay<br>\
them: for, as IAth says, بَدَآءٌ signifies the deeming to be right a thing that is known after its<br>\
having been not known; and this may not be<br>\
attributed to God: but as is said by Suh, in the<br>\
R, one may say, [of God,] بَدَا لَهُ أَنْ يَفْعَلَ كَذَا,<br>\
[properly signifying It occurred to him, or appeared to him, that he should do such a thing,]<br>\
as meaning (tropical:)  He desired to do such a thing; [as<br>\
also بَدَا لَهُ فِى فِعْلِ كَذَا;] and thus the phrase<br>\
in the trad., here mentioned, has been explained.<br>\
(TA.) [One says also, اِفْعَلْ كَذَا مَا بَدَا لَكَ Do<br>\
thou thus as long as it seems fit to thee: see, a<br>\
verse of El-Ahmar cited voce جَلَّ.] ―<br>\
-b3-  بَدَا القَوْمُ,<br>\
(T, S, M, K,) inf. n. بَدْوٌ, (S,) or بَدَآءٌ; (M, K;)<br>\
[the latter of which is said in the TA to be the<br>\
right;] or بَدَا إِلَى البَادِيَةِ, inf. n. بَدَاوَةٌ and بِدَاوَةٌ;<br>\
(Msb;) The people, or company of men, went<br>\
forth to the بَادِيَة [or desert]: (M, Msb, K:) or,<br>\
the former, went forth to their بَادِيَة: (S:) or<br>\
went forth from the region, or district, of towns<br>\
or villages or of cultivated land, to the pasturingplaces in the deserts: (T:) [ISd says,] بَدْوٌ may<br>\
be used as meaning بِدَاوَةٌ, which is the contr. of<br>\
حِضَارَةٌ: (M:) [J says,] بَدَاوَةٌ and بِدَاوَةٌ signify<br>\
the dwelling, or abiding, in the بَادِيَة [or desert];<br>\
the contr. of حِضَارَةٌ: but Th says, I know not<br>\
بَدَاوَةٌ, with fet-h, except on the authority of AZ<br>\
alone: (S:) As says that بداوة and حضارة are<br>\
with kesr to the ب and fet-h to the ح; but AZ<br>\
says the reverse, i. e. with fet-h to the ب and<br>\
kesr to the ح: (T:) both are also explained as<br>\
signifying the going forth to the بَادِيَة: and some<br>\
mention بُدَاوَةٌ, with damm; but this is not known:<br>\
(TA:) ↓ تبدّى like wise signifies he went forth<br>\
from the constant sources of water to the places<br>\
where herbage was to be sought [in the desert];<br>\
(T;) or he dwelt, or abode, in the بَادِيَة. (S, K.)<br>\
It is said in a trad., مَنْ بَدَا جَفَا, i. e. He who<br>\
abides in the desert becomes rude, rough, coarse,<br>\
or uncivil, like the desert-Arabs. (S.) And in<br>\
another, كَانَ يَبْدُو إِلَى هٰذِهِ التِّلَاعِ [He used to<br>\
go forth to these water-courses in the desert, or<br>\
these high grounds,  or low grounds, &amp;c.]. (TA.)―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
[Hence,] بَدَا He voided his excrement, or ordure;<br>\
(M, K;) as also ↓ ابدى (T, K) [and ابدأ]: because<br>\
he who does so goes forth from the tents or houses<br>\
into the open country. (T.)<br>\
-A2-  بَدَانِى بِكَذَا, aor.<br>\
يَبْدُو, is like بَدَأَنِى [i. e. He began with me by<br>\
doing such a thing]. (M, TA.)<br>\
-A3-  بَدِيَتِ الأَرْضُ<br>\
The land produced, or abounded with, بَدَاة, i. e.<br>\
truffles: (K, * TA:) or had in it truffles. (TK.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And The land had in it بَدَاة, meaning dust,<br>\
or earth. (K, * TK.)<br>\
2<br>\
بدّى, inf. n. تَبْدِيَةٌ, He showed, or made<br>\
apparent, a want that occurred, or presented itself,<br>\
to him. (TA.) [See بدَآءَةٌ.] ―<br>\
-b2-  He sent forth<br>\
a horse [or beast] to the place of pasture [app.<br>\
in the بَادِيَة, or desert]. (TA, from a trad.)<br>\
3<br>\
مُبَادَاةٌ The going, or coming, out, or forth,<br>\
in the field, to encounter another in battle, or<br>\
war. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And [more commonly] The showing open enmity, or hostility, with any one: (KL,<br>\
TA:) [a meaning more fully expressed by the<br>\
phrase مُبَادَاةٌ بِالعَدَاوَةِ: for you say,] بَادَى بِالعَدَاوَةِ<br>\
He showed open enmity, or hostility, [with another;] syn. جَاهَرَ بِهَا; (S, K; *) as also ↓ تبادى:<br>\
(K:) or you say, بالعدواة ↓ تبادوا they showed<br>\
open enmity, or hostility, one with another; syn.<br>\
تَجَاهَرُوا بِهَا. (S.) You say also, بادى النَّاسَ بِأَمْرِهِ<br>\
He showed, or revealed, to the people, or to men,<br>\
his affair, or case. (TA.) [Thus, باداهُ بِالأَمْرِ<br>\
and لَهُ الأَمْرَ ↓ ابدى signify the same; i. e. He<br>\
showed, or revealed, to him the affair, or case.]<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  And بادى بَيْنَهُمَا He measured, or compared,<br>\
them both together, each with the other. (A, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
ابداهُ He made it apparent, open, manifest,<br>\
plain, or evident; he showed, exhibited, manifested, evinced, discovered, or revealed, it; (S,<br>\
M, Msb, K;) and it has been said [correctly, as<br>\
will be seen below,] that ابدى عَنْهُ signifies<br>\
the same. (MF, TA.) It is said in a trad.,<br>\
مَنْ يُبْدِ لَنَا صَفْحَتَهُ نَقَمَ عَلَيْهِ كِتَابُ اللّٰهِ, i. e.<br>\
(tropical:)  Whoso showeth, or revealeth, to us his deed [or<br>\
crime] which he was concealing, [the book of<br>\
God shall execute vengeance upon him, meaning]<br>\
we will inflict upon him the punishment ordained<br>\
by the book of God. (TA.) ابدى لَهُ صَفْحَتَهُ also<br>\
means (tropical:)  He showed open enmity, or hostility,<br>\
with him. (A and TA in art. صفح.) And ابدى<br>\
عَنْ قَعْرِهِ, said of water, means It showed its<br>\
bottom, by reason of its clearness. (L in art.<br>\
مكد.) See also 3. ―<br>\
-b2-  أَبْدَيْتَ فِى مَنْطِقِكَ Thou<br>\

بَدْوٌ: see بَادِيَةٌ:<br>\
-A2-  and see also بَادٍ.<br>\
-A3-  Also<br>\
The first of a thing; originally [بَدْءٌ,] with<br>\
hemzeh: (Har p. 583:) and ↓ بَدِىٌّ, also, [originally بَدِىْءٌ,] signifies the first: (TA:) [and<br>\
↓ بَدٍ and ↓ بَدَا, the latter for بَدًا, are used for بَدْءٍ.<br>\
Hence,] one says, ↓ اِفْعَلْ ذٰلِكَ بَادِى بَدٍ, (S,) or<br>\
بَادِىَ بَدٍ, (M, K,) and ↓ بَادِى بَدِى, (Fr, S, M,)<br>\
or بَادِىَ بَدِى, (as in some copies of the K,) or<br>\
↓ بادى بَدِىٍ, (as in other copies of the K and in<br>\
the TA,) and ↓ بَادَىَ بَدًا, (M, K,) mentioned by<br>\
Sb, who says that it is without tenween, though<br>\
analogy does not forbid its being with tenween,<br>\
(M,) meaning Do thou that first; (S, TA;) or,<br>\
the first thing: (Fr, TA:) originally [بَادِئَ بَدْءٍ,<br>\
&amp;c.,] with hemz. (S, K. [See بَدْءٌ.]) Hence also<br>\
the phrase, ↓ الحَمْدُلِلٰهِ بَدِيًّا [Praise be to God<br>\
in the first place]. (TA.)<br>\
بَدِي for بَدٍ: see بَدْوٌ.<br>\

particularly an Arab, of the desert:] a rel. n.<br>\
from بَدْوٌ, (S, M, K,) extr. [with respect to rule],<br>\
(M, K,) for by rule it should be بَدْوِىٌّ; (ElTebreezee, TA;) or it is an irregular rel. n. from<br>\
بَادِيَةٌ: (Msb:) and ↓ بَدَاوِىٌّ and ↓ بِدَاوِىٌّ are<br>\
similar rel. ns., (M, K,) from بَدَاوَةٌ and بِدَاوَةٌ, as<br>\
syn. with بَدْوٌ and بَادِيَةٌ, agreeably with rule; or<br>\
the former of these two may be a rel. n. from<br>\
بَدْوٌ and بَادِيَةٌ, and therefore extr. [with respect<br>\
to rule]; but it is said that when a rel. n. may be<br>\
regarded as regular or irregular, it is more proper<br>\
to regard it as regular; (M;) or the former is a<br>\
rel. n. signifying of, or belonging to, or relating<br>\
to, البَدَاوَة as meaning the dwelling, or abiding, in<br>\
the desert, (S, TA,) accord. to the opinion of AZ;<br>\
and the latter is a rel. n. from البِدَاوَة accord. to<br>\
the opinion of As and others; and is held by Th<br>\
to be the chaste form: (TA:) but بَدَوِىٌّ is the<br>\
only one of these rel. ns. that is known to the<br>\
common people: (M:) it is opposed to a townsman or villager. (TA.) [The pl. is بَدَاوَى, and<br>\
vulg. بِدْوَانٌ. See also بَادٍ, often applied to a man<br>\
as syn. with بَدَوِىٌّ.]<br>\

in the mind; and particularly one that is different<br>\
from a former opinion;] a subst. from بَدَا in the<br>\
phrase بَدَا لَهُ فِى الأَمْرِ. (Msb.) See 1, in four<br>\
places. One says also, ↓ هُوَ ذُو بَدَوَاتٍ He is one<br>\
who has various opinions occurring to him, or<br>\
arising in his mind, (IDrd, S, * K, * and Har<br>\
p. 665,) of which he chooses some and rejects<br>\
others: (IDrd, TA:) it is said in praise, (IDrd,<br>\
TA, and Kzz in Har ubi suprà,) and sometimes<br>\
in dispraise: (Kzz in Har ubi suprà:) بَدَوَاتٌ is<br>\
pl. of ↓ بَداةٌ, [which is therefore syn. with بَدَآءٌ,]<br>\
like as قَطَوَاتٌ is pl. of قَطَاةٌ. (IDrd, TA, and<br>\
Har ubi supra.) One says likewise ↓ أَبُو البَدَوَاتِ,<br>\
meaning The father [i. e. originator] of opinions<br>\
that present themselves to him. (IDrd, TA.) And<br>\
↓ السُّلْطَانُ ذُو عَدَوَاتٍ وَذُو بَدَوَاتٍ (S, [in which the<br>\
context indicates it to mean The Sultán is characterized by deviations from the right way:] but<br>\
accord. to SM, it is) a trad., meaning the Sultán<br>\
ceases not to have some new opinion presenting<br>\
itself to him. (TA.)<br>\

one may also say, بَدَاوَاتٌ. (T.) These two pls.<br>\
also signify Wants that appear, or become apparent, to one. (TA.) [The latter of them is likewise pl. of what next follows.]<br>\
بَدَاوَةٌ and بِدَاوَةٌ: see بَادِيَةٌ. ―<br>\
-b2-  The former also<br>\
signifies The first that appears, or becomes apparent, of a thing. (Lh, M, K.) [See بَدَآءَةٌ.]<br>\

بَادٍ Appearing, or apparent; or becoming, or<br>\

(Msb.) [Hence,] بَادِىَ الرَّأْىِ At the [first] appearance of opinion; (Fr, Lh, M;) or according<br>\
to the appearance of opinion; (Zj, S, K; *) which<br>\
may mean either insincerely or inconsiderately:<br>\
(Zj, TA:) so in the Kur xi. 29; (Zj, S;) where<br>\
only AA read it with hemz: (TA:) if with<br>\
hemz, it is from بَدَأْتُ, and means at first thought,<br>\
or on the first opinion. (S; and Lh in M, art.<br>\
بدأ: see بَدْءٌ.) For بَادِى بَدٍ, or بَادِىَ بَدٍ, and<br>\
