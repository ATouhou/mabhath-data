بَرِحَ is syn. with زَالَ [in two senses; i. e.<br>\
as an attributive verb, and also as a non-attributive verb; as will be shown by what follows].<br>\
(S, A, Mgh.) [Using it as an attributive verb,]<br>\
you say, لَا أَبْرَحُ حَتَّى تَقْضِىَ حَاجَتِى I will not<br>\
go away, or depart, or withdraw, (لَا أَزُولٌ, and<br>\
لَا أَتَنَحَّىِ,) until thou accomplish my want: from<br>\
بَرِحَ المَكَانُ, inf. n. بَرَاحٌ, he went away, or departed, from the place; syn. زَالَ مِنْهُ: and to be<br>\
distinguished from the phrase in the Kur [xviii. 59,<br>\
similar as to words,] mentioned below. (Mgh.)<br>\
You say, بَرِحَ مَكَانَهُ, (S, A, L, K,) aor.<br>\
بَرَحَ, (K,)<br>\
inf. n. بَرَاحٌ (S, L, K) and بُرُوحٌ (L, TA, and<br>\
Ham p. 250) and بَرَحٌ, (L,) or بَرْحٌ, (as in a copy<br>\
of the TA,) He went away, or departed, from<br>\
his place; (S, L, K, and Ham ubi suprà;) and<br>\
he became in the بَرَاح [or wide, uncultivated, or<br>\
uninhabited, tract]. (S, L, K.) And مَا بَرِحَ مَكَانَهُ<br>\
He did not quit his place. (Msb.) And بَرِحَ<br>\
[alone], aor.<br>\
بَرَحَ, inf. n. بَرَاحٌ, It (a thing) went<br>\
away, or departed, (زَالَ,) from its place; (Msb;)<br>\
as also ↓ تبرّح. (L.) In the phrase لَا بَرَاحَ [There<br>\
is, or shall be, no quitting of place, or going<br>\
away, or departing], the noun is in the accus.<br>\
case, as in لَا رَيْبَ: but it is allowable to put<br>\
it in the nom. case, so that لا is used in the<br>\
manner of لَيْسَ; (S, K;) as in the following<br>\
saying of Saad Ibn-Málik, [in the TA, in one<br>\
place, Ibn-Náshib,] in a poem of which the rhyme<br>\
is with refa, (S, IAth,) alluding to El-Hárith<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Abbád, who had withdrawn himself from<br>\
the war of Teghlib and Bekr the sons of Wáïl:<br>\
(IAth, TA:)<br>\
فَأَنَا ابْنُ قَيْسٍ لَا بَرَاحُ مَنْ فَرَّعَنْ نِيرَانِهَا<br>\
[Whoso fleeth from its fires, (i. e. نِيرَانِ الحَرْبِ<br>\
the fires of the war,) let him do so: but as for<br>\
me, I am the son of Keys: to me there is not,<br>\
or shall not be, any quitting of place]. (S, IAth.<br>\
[See also Ham p. 250, where, for مَن فَرَّ, we find<br>\
مَنْ صَدَّ whoso turneth away.]) [Hence,] بَرِحَتِ<br>\
الرِّيحُ بِالتُّرَابِ The wind carried up, raised, or<br>\
swept up and scattered, [lit. went away with,]<br>\
the dust. (Msb.) [Hence also, accord. to some,]<br>\
بَرِحَ الخَفَآءُ, (T, S, K, &amp;c.,) and بَرَحَ, (Ibn-ElLihyánee, Z, and TA, [thus written in a copy of<br>\
the A,]) (tropical:)  The state of concealment departed, or<br>\
ceased: or (tropical:)  what was in a state of concealment<br>\
became apparent; from بَرَاحٌ meaning “what is<br>\
open and apparent” of land: or (tropical:)  what I was<br>\
concealing became apparent: (T, TA:) or (tropical:)  the<br>\
affair, or case, became manifest, (S, A, K,) and<br>\
its concealment ceased, (A,) [or] as though the<br>\
secret departed, and ceased: (S:) or, as some<br>\
say, (assumed tropical:)  the secret became apparent: (TA in art.<br>\
خفى:) or, lit., the low ground became high and<br>\
apparent; meaning (assumed tropical:)  what was concealed became<br>\
revealed: (Har pp. 133—4:) the first who said<br>\
it was Shikk the Diviner. (IDrd, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Using<br>\
it as a non-attributive verb,] you say, لَا أَبْرَحُ<br>\
أَفْعَلُ ذٰلِكَ I will not cease, or I will continue,<br>\
(لَا أَزَالُ,) to do that: (S, A: *) and مَا بَرِحَ يَفْعَلُ<br>\
كَذَا [he ceased not to do thus; or] he persevered<br>\
in, or kept to, doing thus: (Msb:) and مَا بَرِحَ<br>\
زَيْدٌ قَائِمًا [Zeyd ceased not to be, or he kept, or<br>\
continued, standing]: in this case, the verb is of<br>\
the category of كَانَ; (Mgh;) relates to time;<br>\
and requires a predicate: and its inf. n. is بَرَاحٌ.<br>\
(Ham p. 250.) Hence the saying in the Kur<br>\
[xviii. 59], لَا أَبْرَاحُ حَتَّى أَبْلُغَ مَجْمَعَ البَحْرَيْنِ, but<br>\
the predicate is suppressed: it may be مَا نَحْنُ<br>\
فِيهِ كَذٰلِكَ [i. e. I will not cease in that wherein<br>\
we are thus engaged until I reach the place of meeting of the two seas]: (Mgh:) or it means لَا أَزَالُ<br>\
أَسِيرُ [I will not cease journeying]: (Bd, Jel:) or<br>\
لا ابرح here may mean I will not depart (لَا أَزُولُ)<br>\
from that upon which I am intent, namely<br>\
journeying and seeking; and I will not relinquish it; so that it does not require the predicate.<br>\
(Bd. [He gives a third explanation, paraphrastic<br>\
and strained, which I omit.])<br>\
-A2-  بَرَحَ, (S, K,)<br>\
aor.<br>\
بَرَحَ, (L, TA, [but it is implied in the K that<br>\
it is<br>\
بَرُحَ, which is contr. to rule,]) inf. n. بُرُوحٌ,<br>\
It (a gazelle, S, K, and a bird, and any wild<br>\
animal, that is hunted or shot, TA) turned its<br>\
left side towards the spectator, passing by (S, K *)<br>\
from the direction of his right hand towards<br>\
that of his left hand: (S:) or passed by from<br>\
the direction of the spectator&#39;s left hand towards<br>\
that of his right hand: (Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee, IF, L, Msb, in art. سنح:) [the former<br>\
appears to be accord. to the usage of the Hijázees;<br>\
and the latter, accord. to that of the Nejdees, in<br>\
general: see بَارِحٌ:] contr. of سَنَحَ. (S.)<br>\
-A3-<br>\
بَرَحَ, aor.<br>\
بَرُحَ, [contr. to rule,] (K,) inf. n. بَرْحٌ,<br>\
(TA,) He was angry. (K.) When a man has<br>\
been angry with his companion, one says, مَا أَشَدَّ<br>\
مَا بَرَحَ عَلَيْهِ [How violently angry was he with<br>\
him!]. (L.)<br>\
2<br>\
بَرَّحَتْ بِيَ الحُمَّى The fever affected me<br>\
with its severity, violence, or sharpness, termed<br>\
بُرَحَآءُ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, (TA,) from بُرَحَآءُ, (S,<br>\
K,) برّح بِهِ, inf. n. تَبْرِيحٌ, It (an affair, an event,<br>\
or a case,) affected him severely; afflicted, distressed, or harassed, him: (S, K:) said also of<br>\
anxiety; or disquietude, or trouble, of mind:<br>\
(A:) and of a beating, meaning it hurt him<br>\
severely, or greatly. (Msb.) Also said of a man,<br>\
meaning He importuned him, or pressed him,<br>\
with annoyance, or molestation: (A, TA:) he<br>\
annoyed him, or molested him, by importuning<br>\
or pressing; as also ↓ ابرح: (TA:) he annoyed<br>\
him, or molested him, by distressing importunity<br>\
or pressing: (T, TA:) and he punished, tormented, or tortured, him. (TA.) تَبْرِيحٌ signifies<br>\
The act of annoying, molesting, or hurting:<br>\
(Mgh:) and in a trad., (in which it is forbidden,<br>\
TA,) the killing, or putting to death, in an evil<br>\
[or a cruel] manner; such as throwing live fish,<br>\
and lice, into the fire. (Mgh, TA.)<br>\
-A2-  بَرَّحَ اللّٰهُ<br>\
عَنْكَ May God remove from thee البَرْح [i. e.<br>\
difficulty, distress, affliction, &amp;c., or the difficulty,<br>\
&amp;c.]. (A, TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
ابرحهُ He made him, or caused him, to go<br>\
away from, depart from, or quit, his place.<br>\
(A, * L.)<br>\
-A2-  He, or it, pleased, or rejoiced, him;<br>\
excited his admiration and approval; induced<br>\
in him wonder, or admiration, and pleasure, or<br>\
joy. (S, K.) One says also, مَا أَبْرَحَ هٰذَا الأَمْرَ<br>\
How greatly does this affair, or event, please,<br>\
or rejoice! how greatly does it excite admiration<br>\
and approval! or how greatly does it induce<br>\
wonder, or admiration, and pleasure, or joy!<br>\
(S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  He treated him with honour, or honoured<br>\
him, and magnified him: (S, K:) or, as some<br>\
say, he found him to be generous, or noble. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b3-  He judged him, or it, i. e. a man, (A, TA,)<br>\
and a horse, (A,) or anything, (TA,) to be excellent, or to excel, (A, TA,) and wondered at, or<br>\
admired, him, or it. (A.)<br>\
-A3-  ابرح also signifies<br>\
He exceeded the usual bounds, degree, or mode.<br>\
(As, S, * TA.) You say, أَبْرَحْتَ كَرَمًا, and لُؤْمًا,<br>\
(A, TA,) Thou hast done a thing exceeding the<br>\
usual bounds [in generosity, or nobleness, and in<br>\
meanness, or ignobleness]; or extravagant; or<br>\
excessive. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  See also 2.<br>\

تَبَرَّحَ see 1.<br>\
بَرْحٌ Difficulty, distress, affliction, or adversity;<br>\
evil, or mischief; (K, TA;) annoyance, molestation, or hurt; severe punishment; trouble, inconvenience, or fatigue; (TA;) a difficult, a distressing, an afflictive, or adverse, and a wonderful, thing or event: (Ham p. 135:) and annoyance, or molestation, by distressing importunity<br>\
or pressing; a subst. from 2: (T, TA:) and<br>\
بِنْتُ بَرْحٍ, [and app. اِبْنُ بَرْحٍ also,] a calamity,<br>\
misfortune, or disaster; or a great, or terrible,<br>\
thing, affair, or case; (TA;) as also ↓ بِنْتُ بَارِحٍ,<br>\
and ↓ اِبْنُ بَرِيحٍ; (K;) pl. بَنَاتُ بَرْحٍ and بَنُو بَرْحٍ.<br>\
(TA.) [See also تَبْرِيحٌ.] You say, لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ بَرْحًا<br>\
↓ بَارِحًا I experienced from him, or it, [great]<br>\
difficulty, distress, affliction, or adversity; [great]<br>\
annoyance, molestation, or hurt; (S, A, * K; *)<br>\
a phrase having an intensive signification, (K,<br>\
TA,) like لَيْلٌ أَلْيَلُ [and لَيْلٌ لَائِلٌ]; and so بَرْحًا<br>\
↓ مُبَرِّحًا. (TA.) When used as an imprecation,<br>\
the more approved way is to put the two words<br>\
in the accus. case: but sometimes they are put<br>\
in the nom. case; as in the saying of a poet,<br>\
↓ بَرْحٌ لَعيْنَكَ بَارِحٌ [May great difficulty, &amp;c.,<br>\
befall thy two eyes!]. (TA.) You say also,<br>\
لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ بَنَاتِ بَرْحٍ, (S, A,) and بَنِي بَرْحٍ, (S,)<br>\
I experienced from him, or it, difficulties, distresses, afflictions, or adverse events; and calamities, misfortunes, or disasters: (S:) and, in<br>\
the same sense, ↓ لقيت منه البِرَحِينَ, and ↓ البُرَحِينَ,<br>\
(S, K,) and ↓ البَرَحِينَ; (K;) or, accord. to some<br>\
copies of the K, ↓ البِرْحَينِ, and ↓ البُرْحَيْنِ, and<br>\
↓ البَرْحَيْنِ, as duals; but the former reading is<br>\
the more correct: (TA:) [MF disapproves of<br>\
the form بَرَحِينَ, and it is not mentioned in the<br>\
L; but the dual form بَرْحَيْنِ is there mentioned:]<br>\
it seems as though the sing. of بَرِحِينَ [or بُرَحِينَ]<br>\
were بِرَحَةٌ [or بُرَحَةٌ], and that the pl. is formed<br>\
by the termination ون to compensate for the<br>\
rejection of the ة, as is virtually the case in<br>\
أَرَضُونَ; [or because the signification is regarded<br>\
as that of a personification;] and that the pl.<br>\
only is used. (L.) It is said in a prov., بِنْتُ<br>\
بَرْحٍ شَرَكٌ عَلَى رَأْسِكَ [Calamity is, or be, a snare<br>\
upon thy head]. (TA.)<br>\
بَرِحٌ: see مُبَرِّحٌ.<br>\
صَرْحَةَ بَرْحَةَ, or صَرْحَةً بَرْحَةً, &amp;c.: see art. صرح.<br>\
بُرْحَةٌ The best of anything: (TA:) and [particularly] one of the best of she-camels: (S, K:) or,<br>\
of he-camels: (T:) pl. بُرَحٌ. (T, S, K.) You say,<br>\
هٰذِهِ بُرْحَةٌ مِنَ البُرَحِ, (S, K, *) or هُوَ بُرْحَةٌ مِنَ البُرَحِ,<br>\
(T,) This is a she-camel, (S, K, *) or he is a<br>\
camel, (T,) of the best of camels. (T, S, K.)<br>\
بَرْحَي a word that is said when one misses the<br>\
mark in shooting or casting; like as مَرْحَي is said<br>\
when one hits the mark. (S, ISd, A, K.)<br>\
بُرَحَآءُ Severity, violence, or sharpness, (As, A,<br>\
TA,) or vehement molestation, (S, K,) of a fever<br>\
(As, A, S, K) &amp;c.: (S, K:) [a paroxysm; used<br>\
in this sense by modern physicians:] and vehement distress of mind arising from the oppression<br>\
caused by inspiration or revelation; such as is<br>\
said to have affected the Prophet; [but most<br>\
probably a paroxysm of that species of catalepsy<br>\
which physicians term ecstasy;] occurring in a<br>\
trad. (TA.) You say of one suffering from fever,<br>\
when it is intense, أَصَابَتْهُ البُرَحَآءُ [The paroxysm,<br>\
or severe fit, has befallen him]. (TA.)<br>\
البِرَحِينَ and البُرَحِينَ &amp;c.: see بَرْحٌ<br>\
بَرَاحٌ inf. n. of بَرِحَ, q. v.; whence the phrase<br>\
لَا بَرَاحَ, explained above. (S, L, K.)<br>\
-A2-  A wide,<br>\
or spacious, tract of land, (S, A, K,) kaving in it<br>\
no seed-produce nor trees: (S, K:) or land having<br>\
in it no building nor habitation: (Ham p. 237:)<br>\
and applied as an epithet to land, signifying wide,<br>\
or spacious, open, or conspicuous, and having in<br>\
it no herbage nor habitation: and what is open,<br>\
uncovered, and wholly apparent, of land: (TA:)<br>\
or a place having no trees nor other things to<br>\
cover or conceal it; as though such things had<br>\
departed; (Mgh;) a place free from trees &amp;c.:<br>\
(Msb:) or an elevated and open tract of land.<br>\
(Har p. 134.) ―<br>\
-b2-  حَبِيلُ بَرَاحٍ is an appellation<br>\
given to (tropical:)  A lion: and (assumed tropical:)  a courageous man: as<br>\
though each of them were bound with ropes, (K,<br>\
TA,) and did not quit his place. (TA.)<br>\
-A3-  An<br>\
affair, a thing, or a case, that is plain, evident, or<br>\
manifest; (K, TA;) or open, or public. (TA.)<br>\
You say, جَآءَنَا بِالأَمْرِ بَرَاحًا [He told us, or did to<br>\
us, the thing] plainly [or openly]. (S.) And<br>\
جَآءَ بِالكُفْرِ بَرَاحًا وَ بِالشَّرِّ صُرَاحًا [He uttered, or<br>\
committed an act of, infidelity plainly, or openly,<br>\
and evil, or mischief, unmixedly]. (A, TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
Counsel, or an opinion, that is disapproved, or<br>\
deemed evil. (K.)<br>\
-A4-  بَرَاحِ, (El-Mufaddal, S, A,<br>\
&amp;c.,) and بَرَاحُ, with damm and without tenween,<br>\
(AZ, El-Mufaddal,) a name of The sun: (S, A,<br>\
&amp;c.:) determinate [and the former indecl.]: the<br>\
sun is so called because of the spreading of its<br>\
light, and its conspicuousness; or, being applied<br>\
to the sun when it sets, براح means بَارِحَةٌ; like as<br>\
كَسَابِ, a name applied to a hunting-bitch, means<br>\
كَاسِبَةٌ. (TA.) You say, دَلَكَتْ بَرَاحِ The sun set [or<br>\
declined from the meridian]. (A, TA.) For this<br>\
phrase, occurring at the end of a verse cited by<br>\
Ktr, Fr reads دَلَكَتْ بِرَاحِ; راح being pl. [or<br>\
rather a quasi-pl. n.] of رَاحَةٌ, meaning the “hand”<br>\
[or “palm of the hand”]: (S, TA:) accord. to<br>\
which reading, the poet means The sun had<br>\
set, or had declined from the meridian, while<br>\
they put their hands, or the palms of their<br>\
hands, over their eyes, looking to see if it had<br>\
set, or had declined from the meridian: or<br>\
he who says, دَلَكَتِ الشَّمْسُ بِرَاحِ means the sun<br>\
had almost set: the two readings بَراح and بِراح<br>\
are mentioned by A&#39;Obeyd and Az and Hr and Z<br>\
and others: AZ says, دلكت بِرَاحٍ, with tenween,<br>\
and بَرَاحٌ, without tenween. (TA.) [See also<br>\
رَاحَةٌ, in art. روح.]<br>\
بَرُوحٌ: see بَارِحٌ.<br>\
بَرِيحٌ: see بَارِحٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also The croaking of the<br>\
غُرَاب [or crow, of whatever species, as raven,<br>\
carrion-crow, &amp;c.]. (L.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] اِبْنُ بَرِيحٍ:<br>\
so in the K: in the S, أُمُّ بَرِيحٍ; but IB and<br>\
Aboo-Zekereeyà say that only the former is right:<br>\
(TA:) [in one copy of the S, however, I find<br>\
both of these:] The غُرَاب [or crow, as a generic<br>\
term, applying to the raven, carrion-crow, &amp;c.]:<br>\
(S, K, &amp;c.:) so called because of its cry: a determinate appellation: for the pl., the expression<br>\
used is بَنَاتُ بَرِيحٍ. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  See also بَرْحٌ.<br>\
-A3-<br>\
قَوْلٌ بَرِيحٌ A saying by which one pronounces a<br>\
person to have said, or done, right. (L.)<br>\
بَارِحٌ, (S, K, &amp;c.,) as also ↓ بَرُوحٌ and ↓ بَرِيحٌ,<br>\
(K,) applied to a gazelle, (S,) or what is hunted<br>\
or shot, (K, TA,) of gazelles and birds and wild<br>\
animals [in general], (TA,) Turning his left side<br>\
towards the spectator, (S,) passing from the direction of the right hand of the latter towards the<br>\
direction of his left hand: (S, K:) or turning his<br>\
right side towards the spectator, passing from the<br>\
direction of the latter&#39;s left hand towards that of<br>\
his right: (Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee, IF, A, *<br>\
L, Msb, * in art. سنح:) contr. of سَانِحٌ: (S, *<br>\
TA:) pl. بَوَارِحُ. (L in art. سنح.) The Arabs<br>\
[who apply the epithet in the latter sense] regard<br>\
the بارح as an evil omen, and the سانح as a good<br>\
omen; because one cannot shoot at the former<br>\
without turning himself: (S:) but some of them<br>\
hold the reverse: (Aboo-&#39;Amr Esh-Sheybánee<br>\
and L in art. سنح:) the people of Nejd hold the<br>\
سانح to be a good omen; but sometimes a Nejdee<br>\
adopts the opinion of the Hijázee [which is the<br>\
contrary]. (IB in that art.) The first of these<br>\
epithets is also applied to a bird as meaning Inauspicious; ill-omened. (A.) It is said in a<br>\
prov., مَنْ لِى بِا لسَّانِحِ بَعْدَ البَارِحِ (TA) i. e. [Who<br>\
will be responsible to me] for a fortunate, or lucky,<br>\
event, after an unfortunate, or unlucky? (K in<br>\
art. سنح:) applied in the case of a man&#39;s doing<br>\
evil, and its being said, “He will at a future time<br>\
do good to thee:” originally said by a man on<br>\
the occasion of gazelles&#39; passing before him in the<br>\
manner of such as are termed بَارِحَة, and its being<br>\
said to him, “They will present themselves to<br>\
thee in the manner of such as are termed سَانحَة.”<br>\
(TA.) And in another prov. it is said, إِنَّمَا هُوَ<br>\
كَبَارِحِ الأَرْوَى [It, or he, is only like the mountain-goat passing in the manner of such as is<br>\
termed بارح]: for it dwells on the tops of the<br>\
mountains, and men scarcely ever see it passing<br>\
with the right or left side towards them save once<br>\
in the course of ages: (S, K:) applied in the case<br>\
of an extraordinary occurrence: (K:) [or in the<br>\
case of a benefit conferred by a man who very<br>\
rarely confers benefits on others: (Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov. i. 35:)] or when a man has delayed, or<br>\
been tardy in, visiting [but has come at last].<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence, فِتْلَةٌ بَارِحَةٌ i. q. شَزْرَةٌ [i. e. (tropical:)  A<br>\
manner of twisting contrary to that which is<br>\
usual: see شَزَرَ]. (A.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And هٰذِهِ فَعْلةٌ بَارِحَةٌ<br>\
(tropical:)  This is an action that has not happened rightly.<br>\
(A.) ―<br>\
-b4-  [Hence,] بِنْتُ بَارِحٌ: and [perhaps] لَقِيتُ<br>\
مِنْهُ بَرْحًا بَارِحًا: and بَرْحٌ لِعَيْنَكَ بَارِحٌ: see بَرْحٌ.<br>\
―<br>\
-b5-  [And hence, perhaps, because of its evil effect;<br>\
or because it comes, accord. to some, from the<br>\
left, i. e. northerly direction, or, accord. to others,<br>\
from the right, i. e. southerly direction; or] from<br>\
بَرْحٌ as signifying “a difficult, a distressing, an<br>\
afflictive, or adverse, and a wonderful, thing, or<br>\
event;” (Ham p. 135;) بَارِحٌ signifies also A hot<br>\
wind: (S:) or a hot wind in the صَيْفٌ [i. e. summer or spring]: (K:) or a hot wind coming from<br>\
the direction of El-Yemen: (Ham p. 135:) or a<br>\
wind that carries up, raises, or sweeps up and<br>\
scatters, the dust: (Msb:) pl. بَوارِحُ: (S, K, &amp;c.:)<br>\
or the بوارح are hot north, or northerly, winds in<br>\
the صَيْف: (AZ, Az, S:) this Az found to be the<br>\
sense in which the term was used by the Arabs in<br>\
his time: (TA:) or violent winds that carry with<br>\
them the dust by reason of their violence: (TA:)<br>\
or this name (the pl.) was given by the Arabs to<br>\
all winds in the time of the stars of the قَيْظ [or<br>\
summer]: they mostly blow in the time of the<br>\
stars of Libra; [app. meaning when Libra is on,<br>\
or near, the meridian at nightfall, agreeably with<br>\
a statement in modern Arabic almanacs, that the<br>\
periods of the beginning and end of the winds<br>\
thus called are the 30th of May and the 9th of<br>\
July;] and these winds are what are termed the<br>\
سَمَائِم [pl. of سَمُومٌ]. (Ibn-Kunáseh, TA.) ―<br>\
-b6-<br>\
البَوَارِحُ is also said by some to signify الأَنْوَآءُ [pl.<br>\
of نَوْءٌ, q. v.]; as mentioned by AHn; but he<br>\
repels their assertion. (TA.)<br>\
البَارِحَةُ The next, or nearest, past, or preceding,<br>\
night; yesternight: (S, A, Mgh, * Msb, * K:) from<br>\
بَرِحَ signifying زَالَ [“he, or it, went away” &amp;c.].<br>\
(S, A.) [In modern Arabic, Yesterday; as also<br>\
البَارِح.] It has no dim. formed from it. (Sb, in S, in<br>\
art. أمس; and TA.) You say, لَقِيتُهُ البَارِحَة [I met,<br>\
or met with, him, or it, last night, or yesternight]:<br>\
and لَقِيتُهُ البَارِحَةَ الأُولَي [I met, or met with, him, or<br>\
it, the night before last; this being the sense in which<br>\
the phrase is now used by the learned: but the vulgar expression is أَوَّل البَارِحَة, generally pronounced<br>\
أَوَّل اَمْبَارِحَهْ or أَوَّل اَمْبَارِحْ, agreeably with a peculiarity of the dial. of the people of El-Yemen, or<br>\
of Teiyi and Himyer, by the substitution of اَمْ<br>\
for اَلْ: see art. ام]. (S) From daybreak to the<br>\
time when the sun declines from the meridian,<br>\
one says, رَأَيْتُ اللَّيْلَةَ فِى مَنَامِى [I saw to-night<br>\
in my sleep (such a thing)]; but when the sun<br>\
has declined, one says, رَأَيْتُ البَارِحَةَ [I saw last<br>\
night, or yesternight]: (AZ, Th: [and the like is<br>\
said in the Mgh and Msb:]) or one says, كَانَ<br>\
كَذَا وَ كَذَا اللَّيْلَةَ [Such and such things happened<br>\
to-night] until the sun is somewhat high and the<br>\
day has become bright; but after this, one says,<br>\
كَانَ البَارِحَةَ [It happened last night, or yesternight]. (Yoo, Seer.) The Arabs say,<br>\
مَا أَشْبَهَ اللَّيْلَةَ بِا لبَارِحَةِ<br>\
How like is this night wherein we are to the<br>\
former night that has departed! (TA:) [or, this<br>\
night to yesternight!]: originally occurring in a<br>\
poem of Tarafeh: used as meaning “how like is<br>\
the child to the father!” and applied to [any] two<br>\
things resembling each other. (Har p. 667.)<br>\
أَبْرَحُ is formed [from بَرَحَ for بَرَّحَ] by the<br>\
rejection of the added letter: [for a word of this<br>\
kind is regularly formed only from an unaugmented triliteral-radical verb:] or it is like أَحْنَكُ,<br>\
having no proper verb. (L.) You say, هٰذَا<br>\
أَبْرَحُ عَلَىَّ مِنْ ذَاكَ (A, * L, Msb *) This is<br>\
more difficult, distressing, or afflicting, to me<br>\
than that. (L, Msb. *) And هٰذَآ الأَمْرُ أَبْرَحُ مِنْ<br>\
هٰذَا This affair, event, or case, is more difficult,<br>\
or distressing, than this. (S.) And قَتَلُوهُمْ أَبْرَحَ<br>\
قَتْلٍ [They slew them with a most severe slaughter]. (S.)<br>\
تَبْرِيحٌ [inf. n. of 2, used as a simple subst.,]<br>\
is said by some to be sing. of تَبَارِيحُ, and has<br>\
been used as such by post-classical authors, but<br>\
is not of established authority: accord. to others,<br>\
the latter has no sing.: (MF:) the pl. signifies<br>\
Difficulties, distresses, afflictions, or adversities:<br>\
[see also بَرْحٌ:] or the difficulties, or obligations,<br>\
incurred by troublesome, or inconvenient, means<br>\
of obtaining subsistence: (TA:) and تَبَارِيحُ الشَّوْقِ<br>\
the burning, or fierce burning, [or the burnings,<br>\
&amp;c.,] of the yearning, or longing, of the soul,<br>\
or of longing desire. (S, K.)<br>\
أنَا مُبَرَّحٌ بِى I am importuned, or pressed, with<br>\
annoyance, or molestation. (A, TA.) [See the<br>\
verb (2).]<br>\
مُبَرِّحٌ and ↓ بَرِحٌ, applied to an affair, an event,<br>\
or a case, signify the same; (K, TA;) i. e.<br>\
Severe, afflicting, distressing, or harassing: (TA:)<br>\
and the former, to a beating, (S, A, Mgh, TA,)<br>\
meaning the same; (TA;) or hurting (S, Mgh)<br>\
severely: (S:) and to a man, meaning annoying,<br>\
or molesting, by importuning, or pressing. (TA.)<br>\
[See 2.] لَقِيتُ مِنْهُ بَرْحًا مُبَرِّحًا: see بَرْحٌ.<br>\
يَبْرُوحٌ, (K,) thus correctly written, with the ى<br>\
before the ب; [not بيروح, as in the CK; in<br>\
Chald.<br>\
יַבְרוּחַ, the word corresponding to the<br>\
sing. of the Hebr.<br>\
דּוּרָאִי� in Gen. xxx. 14 and<br>\
16, accord. to the paraphrase of Onkelos;] or<br>\
يَبْرُوحٌ صَنَمِىٌّ [the idol-like يبروح]; (TA;) The<br>\
root, or lower part, of the wild لُفَّاح [or mandrake,<br>\
not to be confounded with another plant to which<br>\
the name of لُفَّاح, q. v., is also applied], (K,)<br>\
which is known by the names of فَاوَانِيَا and عُودُ<br>\
الصَّلِيبِ [names now given to the peony], and<br>\
called by MF تُفَّاحُ البَرِّ, [or the wild apple, but<br>\
perhaps this is a mistranscription for لُفَّاحُ البَرِّ,]<br>\
said by him to be an appellation used by the<br>\
vulgar; (TA;) resembling the form of a man;<br>\
(K;) and of two sorts, male and female; called<br>\
by the people of Greece عَبْدُ السَّلَامِ: (TA:) it<br>\
torpifies, (K,) and strengthens the two appetites<br>\
[namely that of the stomach and that of the generative organ): (TA:) if ivory is cooked with<br>\
it for six hours, it renders it soft; and if a part<br>\
affected by [the disease termed] بَرَش is rubbed<br>\
with its leaves for a week, (K,) without interruption, (TA,) it removes it without causing<br>\
ulcers, or sores: (K:) the root of the wild لُفَّاح<br>\
is the يَبْروح: it has the form of a human being;<br>\
the male like the male, and the female like the<br>\
female; and they pretend that he who pulls it<br>\
up dies; wherefore, when they desire to do so, they<br>\
tie a dog or some other animal to it. (Kzw, voce<br>\
لُفَّاح.)<br>\
