بَاعَهُ, (S, Mgh, &amp;c.,) aor. يَبِيعُ, (S, Msb, K,)<br>\
inf. n. بَيْعٌ (S, Mgh, Msb, K) and مَبِيعٌ, (S, Msb,<br>\
K,) which latter is anomalous, (S,) the regular<br>\
form being مَبَاعٌ, (S, K,) has two contr. significacations: He sold it: and he bought it: (S, Mgh,<br>\
Msb, K:) and ↓ اباعهُ is a dial. var. of the same:<br>\
(IKtt, Msb:) [but app. only in the former sense:]<br>\
or this last signifies he offered it for sale; or exposed it to sale: (S, K:) and ↓ ابتاعهُ, as well as<br>\
بَاعَهُ, signifies he bought it. (S, * Mgh, * Msb, K.)<br>\
The primary signification of بَيْعٌ is The exchanging,<br>\
or exchange, of property; or the making an exchange with property; as in the phrases بَيْعٌ رَابِحٌ<br>\
[an exchange of property bringing gain], and<br>\
بَيْعٌ خَاسِرٌ [an exchange of property occasioning<br>\
loss]: and this is a proper signification when it<br>\
relates to real substances: but it is tropically used<br>\
to signify the making the contract [of sale and<br>\
purchase]; because this is the means of giving<br>\
[and obtaining] possession: [though this signification is what is termed حَقِيقَةٌ عُرْفِيَّةٌ, i. e., a sense<br>\
so common as to be conventionally regarded as<br>\
proper:] the phrase صَحَّ البَيْعُ, or بَطَلَ, and the<br>\
like, mean صَفْقَةُ البَيْعِ; [i. e. The contract of sale,<br>\
or purchase, was valid, or was null;] but the<br>\
prefixed n. being suppressed, and its complement<br>\
[alone] used for it, and this being masc., the verb<br>\
is made masc. (Msb.) بَاعَ [mostly signifies He<br>\
sold; and] is doubly trans., both by itself and by<br>\
means of مِنْ prefixed to the second object; (Mgh,<br>\
Msb;) this prep. being thus used as a corroborative: (Msb:) you say, بَاعَهُ الشَّىْءَ and بَاعَهُ مِنْهُ<br>\
[He sold to him the thing and He sold it to<br>\
him]: (Mgh:) and بِعْتُ زَيْدًا الدَّارَ and بِعْتُ مِنْ<br>\
زَيْدٍ الدَّارَ [I sold to Zeyd the house: (see also an<br>\
explanation of the phrase اِسْتَبَعْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ: and see<br>\
بَاعَهُ مِنَ السُّلْطَانِ: to which might be added<br>\
countless similar instances; for when باع signifies<br>\
he sold, مِنْ is generally prefixed to the noun or<br>\
pronoun denoting the person to whom the thing<br>\
is sold:)] and sometimes لِ is put in the place of<br>\
مِنْ; so that you say, بِعْتُكَ الشَّىْءَ and بِعْتُهُ لَكَ [I<br>\
sold to thee the thing and I sold it to thee]; the<br>\
ل being redundant [when the verb has this meaning, though not when it has the contr. meaning,<br>\
as will be seen below]. (Msb.) Of the contr.<br>\
signification we have an ex. in the saying of ElFarezdak,<br>\
إِنَّ الشَّبَابَ لَرَابِحٌ مَنْ بَاعَهَا<br>\
وَالشَّيْبُ لَيْسَ لِبَائِعِيهِ تِجَارُ<br>\
[Verily youthfulness, he who buys it is a gainer;<br>\
but hoariness, there are no traffickers for its<br>\
sellers; the part. a. being here from the verb in<br>\
the former sense]: (S, TA:) and [often in a case<br>\
in which the verb is followed by ل; as] in بَاعَ لَهُ<br>\
الشَّىْءَ He bought for him the thing; (Mgh;) [the<br>\
ل not being redundant when the verb is used in<br>\
this sense;] and as in the saying of Tarafeh,<br>\
وَيَأْتِيكَ بالْأَخْبَارِ مَنْ لَمْ تَبِعْ لَهُ<br>\
بَتَاتًا وَلَمْ تَضْرِبْ لَهُ وَقْتَ مَوْعِدِ<br>\
[And he will bring thee tidings for whom thou hast<br>\
not bought travelling-provisions, and for whom<br>\
thou hast not assigned an appointed time for his<br>\
bringing them]: (TA:) and in the saying, بَاعَ<br>\
دُنْيَاهُ بِآخِرَتِهِ (tropical:)  [He purchased his enjoyments of<br>\
the present world at the expense of his enjoyments<br>\
of the world to come]: (Z, TA:) and [in like<br>\
manner] you say, زَيْدٌ الدَّارَ ↓ ابتاع, meaning Zeyd<br>\
bought the house: and لِغَيْرِهِ ↓ ابتاعها He bought it<br>\
for another person. (Msb.) The verb has this<br>\
signification, also, in the trad., لَا يَبِعْ بَعْضُكُمْ عَلَى<br>\
بَيْعِ أَخِيهِ [One of you shall not buy in opposition<br>\
to the buying of his brother when an agreement<br>\
has been manifested but the contract has not been<br>\
concluded]; (S, IAth, Mgh, Msb; [but in the S<br>\
and Msb and by IAth, the trad. is related thus;<br>\
لَا يَخْطُبِ الرَّجُلُ عَلَى خِطْبَةِ أَخِيهِ وَلَا يَبِعْ عَلَى بَيْعِ<br>\
أَخِيهِ; (see art. خطب;)]) as is shown by the<br>\
relation of Bkh, الرَّجُلُ عَلَى بَيْعِ أَخِيهِ ↓ لَا يَبْتَاعُ:<br>\
(Mgh, Msb:) or it may here have the contr.<br>\
meaning: (IAth:) Az says that the seller and<br>\
buyer are equal in offence when either of them<br>\
does thus to another. (TA.) [Similar to this is<br>\
the saying, لَا يَسُومُ الرَّجُلُ عَلَى سَوْمِ أَخِيهِ: see<br>\
art. سوم. See also بَاعَ عَلَى بَيْعِهِ below, used in<br>\
a tropical sense.] You say also, بَاعَ عَلَيْهِ القَاضِى,<br>\
meaning The judge sold against his will; (Mgh;)<br>\
sold without his consent. (Msb.) ―<br>\
-b2-  The pass.<br>\
form is بِيعَ [It was sold: and it was bought]: (S,<br>\
K:) optionally either [thus] with kesr to the ب,<br>\
or [بُيْعَ] with damm to the ب, (S,) [or rather<br>\
with a sound between that of damm and that of<br>\
kesr, which pronunciation is termed إِشْمَامٌ;] and<br>\
some say بُوعَ; (S, K;) changing the ى into و:<br>\
and thus in the cases of كِيلَ and قِيلَ and the<br>\
like: (S:) [but Ibn-Málik requires damm or<br>\
اشمام in the passive of a verb of which the medial<br>\
radical is ى, and kesr or اشمام in the passive of a<br>\
verb of which the medial radical is و, to prevent<br>\
the mistaking of an active verb for a passive in<br>\
such cases as بِعْتُ and سُمْتُ: others, however,<br>\
only prefer what Ibn-Málik absolutely requires in<br>\
these cases. (See I&#39;Ak p. 131.)] ―<br>\
-b3-  You say also,<br>\
بَاعَهُ مِنَ السُّلْطَانِ, [lit. He sold him to the Sultán,]<br>\
meaning (tropical:)  he slandered him, or calumniated him,<br>\
to the Sultán. (K, TA.) ―<br>\
-b4-  And بَاعَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى<br>\
بَيْعِهِ, [of which the lit. meaning has been shown<br>\
above,] meaning (tropical:)  Such a one superseded him, or<br>\
occupied his place, in respect of honourable and<br>\
elevated station or rank, and gained the mastery<br>\
over him; (K, * TA;) and so حَلَّ بِوَادِيهِ: (TA:)<br>\
or بَاعَ فُلَانٌ عَلَى بَيْعِ فُلَانٍ means (tropical:)  such a one<br>\
gained the mastery over such a one, and wrested<br>\
from him that which he sought to obtain from<br>\
him; and is an old proverb, applied by the<br>\
Arabs to a man who contends with another, and<br>\
seeks to obtain a thing from him by superior power<br>\
or force, when he has succeeded in doing as above<br>\
explained; and similar to it is the saying شَقَّ فُلَانٌ<br>\
غُبَارَ فُلَانٍ. (El-Mufaddal Ed-Dabbee, TA.) One<br>\
also says, مَا بَاعَ عَلَى بَيْعِكَ أَحَدٌ, meaning (assumed tropical:)  Not<br>\
any one has equalled thee. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  بَيْعٌ is also<br>\
used in the sense of اِنْبِسَاطٌ. (TA in art. بوع.<br>\
[See اِنْبَاعَ in that art.])<br>\
3<br>\
بَايَعْتُهُ, (S, Mgh, TA,) inf. n. مُبَايَعَةٌ and<br>\
بِيَاعٌ, (TA,) is from البَيْعُ; and so is ↓ التَّبَايُعُ;<br>\
(S, TA;) this being syn. with المُبَايَعَةُ. (K, TA.)<br>\
You say, بَايَعَا and ↓ تَبَايَعَا, meaning They two<br>\
sold and bought, each with the other: (TK:) and<br>\
↓ تَبَايَعْنَا [We sold and bought, one with another]:<br>\
(Mgh:) and بايعهُ also signifies He bartered, or<br>\
exchanged commodities, with him. (TA.) [See<br>\
1; where a citation from the Msb indicates that<br>\
this latter is the primary signification accord. to<br>\
the author of that work.] ―<br>\
-b2-  It is also from البَيْعَةُ;<br>\
and so is ↓ التَّبَايُعُ: (S, TA: *) المُبَايَعَةُ and ↓ التَّبَايُعُ<br>\
from البَيْعَةُ signifying The making a covenant, a<br>\
compact, an engagement, or the like; as though<br>\
each of the two parties sold what he had to the<br>\
other, and gave him his own special property,<br>\
and his obedience, and all that pertained to his<br>\
case. (TA.) [Hence,] بايع الأَمِيرَ He promised,<br>\
or swore, allegiance to the prince; making a covenant with him to submit to him the judgment of<br>\
his own case and of the cases of the Muslims [in<br>\
general], not to dispute with him in respect of<br>\
anything thereof, but to obey him in whatever<br>\
command he might impose upon him, pleasing<br>\
and displeasing: in doing which, it was usual<br>\
for the person making this covenant to place his<br>\
hand in the hand of the prince, in confirmation<br>\
of the covenant, like as is done by the seller and<br>\
buyer; wherefore the act was termed بَيْعَةٌ, an<br>\
inf. n. [of un.] of بَاعَ. (Ibn-Khaldoon, in De<br>\
Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Ar., 2nd ed., ii. 256 — 7.) [And<br>\
hence the phrases, بُويِعَ بِالِخِلَافَةِ and بُويِعَ لَهُ<br>\
بِالخِلَافَةِ He had the promise, or oath, of allegiance made to him as being Khaleefeh.] You<br>\
say also, بايعهُ عَلَيْهِ, inf. n. مُبَايَعَةٌ, He made a<br>\
covenant, a compact, an engagement, or the like,<br>\
with him, respecting it, or to do it: and ↓ تبايعوا<br>\
عَلَى الأَمْرِ [they made a covenant, &amp;c., respecting,<br>\
or to do, the thing, or affair]; like as you say<br>\
أَصْفَقُوا عَلَيْهِ. (TA.)<br>\

6<br>\
تَبَاْيَعَ see 3, throughout.<br>\
7<br>\
إِنْبَيَعَ انباع It was, or became, saleable, or easy of<br>\
sale; it had an easy, or a ready, sale: (Ibn-<br>\
&#39;Abbád, K:) as though quasi-pass. of بَاعَهُ [and<br>\
therefore primarily signifying it was, or became,<br>\
sold, or bought]. (TA.)<br>\
8<br>\
إِبْتَيَعَ see 1, in four places.<br>\
10<br>\
اِسْتَبَعْتُهُ الشَّىْءَ I asked him to sell the thing<br>\
to me; expl. by سَأَلْتُهُ أَنْ يَبِيعَهُ مِنِّى; (S, K; *)<br>\
for instance, عَبْدَهُ [his slave.] (Mgh.)<br>\
بَيْعٌ inf. n. of 1 [q. v.]. ―<br>\
-b2-  It also signifies The<br>\
hire, or hiring, of land. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also A thing<br>\
sold, or bought: (Mgh, Msb, TA:) a subst. in<br>\
this sense: (Mgh, TA:) pl. بُيُوعٌ: (Mgh, Msb,<br>\
TA:) which is also used as a pl. of the inf. n.,<br>\
to signify Kinds of selling and buying. (Mgh.)<br>\
See also بِيَاعَةٌ.<br>\
بَيْعَةٌ [inf. n. of un. of بَاعَ. ―<br>\
-b2-  Hence,] A striking together of the hands of two contracting<br>\
parties in token of the ratification of a sale.<br>\
(Msb, TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And [hence,] The act of مُبَايَعَة<br>\
[or promising, or swearing, allegiance and obedience, as explained above, (see 3,)] and submission,<br>\
or obedience. (Msb, TA.) Whence, أَيْمَانُ البَيْعَةِ<br>\
[The oaths of allegiance and obedience]; (Ibn-Khaldoon, in De Sacy&#39;s Chrest. Ar., 2nd ed.,<br>\
ii. 257; and Msb;) which the Khaleefehs exacted; (Ibn-Khaldoon;) and which El-Hajjáj<br>\
appointed, including hard, or difficult, matters,<br>\
relating to divorce and emancipation and fasting<br>\
and the like. (Msb.)<br>\
بِيعَةٌ A mode, or manner, of selling or buying.<br>\
(S, Mgh, K.) Hence, صَاحِبُ بِيعَةٍ [A person<br>\
occupying himself in any kind of selling or buying]: occurring in a trad. of Ibn-&#39;Omar. (Mgh,<br>\
TA.) And إِنَّهُ لَحَسَنُ البِيعَةِ [Verily he is good<br>\
in the manner of selling or buying]. (S, Mgh,<br>\
TA.)<br>\
-A2-  [A Christian church;] a place of worship<br>\
(K) pertaining to the Christians: (S, Mgh, Msb,<br>\
K:) or, as some say, a synagogue of the Jews:<br>\
(TA:) pl. بِيَعٌ, (K, TA,) or بِيْعٌ. (Msb: [but<br>\
this I think a mistake: if correct, it is a coll.<br>\
gen. n.])<br>\
بَيُوعٌ: see بَيِّعٌ.<br>\
بَيَاعَةٌ An article of merchandise; (Lth, S, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ بَيْعٌ [q. v. suprà]: (Mgh:) pl. of the<br>\
former بِيَاعَاتٌ. (K.)<br>\
بَيِّعٌ: see بَائِعٌ, in five places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also A man<br>\
who sells, or buys, well; and so ↓ بَيُوعٌ: fem. of<br>\
the former with ة: pl. mase. بَيِّعُونَ, and pl. fem.<br>\
بَيِّعَاتٌ; neither the masc. nor the fem. having a<br>\
broken pl. (TA.)<br>\
بَيَّاعٌ A man who sells, or buys, much. (TA.)<br>\
بَائِعٌ Selling, or a seller: and buying, or a<br>\
buyer: (Msb, K, * TA:) as also ↓ بَيِّعٌ: (K:) the<br>\
former signification is the more obvious when<br>\
بائع is used without restriction: (Msb:) and ↓ بَيِّعٌ<br>\
also signifies [accord. to some] a bargainer, or<br>\
chafferer; (K, TA;) not a seller nor a buyer;<br>\
but Esh-Sháfi&#39;ee and Az deny that this epithet is<br>\
applied to a man before he has concluded the<br>\
contract: (L, TA:) the pl. of بائع is بَاعَةٌ: (ISd,<br>\
K:) and the pl. of ↓ بيّع is بِيَعَآءُ [or rather this is<br>\
a quasi-pl. n.] and أَبْيعَآءُ: (K:) and Kr holds<br>\
that بَاعَةٌ is pl. of بيّع. (TA.) ↓ البَيِّعَانِ signifies The<br>\
seller and the buyer; (S, Mgh;) and so ↓ المُتَبَايِعَانِ.<br>\
(TA.) It is said in a trad., بِالخِيَارِ مَا ↓ البَيِّعَانِ<br>\
لَمْ يَتَفَرَّقَا, and in another, ↓ المُتَبَايِعَانِ, [The seller<br>\
and the buyer have the option of cancelling the<br>\
contract as long as they have not separated.]<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  اِمْرَأَةٌ بَائِعٌ (tropical:)  A woman who easily obtains<br>\
a suitor; or who is much in demand; by reason<br>\
of her beauty: (K, TA:) as though she sold<br>\
herself: like نَاقَةٌ تَاجِرَةٌ. (Z, TA.)<br>\
مَبِيعٌ Sold: and bought: as also ↓ مَبْيُوعٌ: (S,<br>\
K:) in the latter sense syn. with ↓ مُبْتَاعٌ. (Msb.)<br>\
Kh says that the letter suppressed in مَبِيعٌ is the<br>\
و of the measure مَفْعُولٌ, because it is augmentative: but Akh says that the letter suppressed is<br>\
the medial radical; for when they made the ى<br>\
quiescent, they transferred its vowel to the letter<br>\
before it, so that it became madmoomeh, [the<br>\
word thus being altered to مَبُيْوعٌ,] then they<br>\
changed the dammeh into kesreh because of the<br>\
ى after it, then the ى was suppressed, and the<br>\
و was changed into ى, like the و of مِيزَانٌ,<br>\
because of the kesreh: accord. to El-Mázinee,<br>\
each of these sayings is good; but that of Akh is<br>\
the more agreeable with analogy. (S.)<br>\
مَبْيُوعٌ: see مَبِيعٌ.<br>\
مُبْتَاعٌ: see مَبِيعٌ.<br>\
مُتَبَايِعٌ: see بَائِعٌ, in two places.<br>\
