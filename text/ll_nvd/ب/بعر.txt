camel, and also of a sheep and goat, (S,) and of a<br>\
cloven-hoofed animal (Mgh, Msb, K) of the wild<br>\

customary for the widow to collect a number of<br>\
pieces of بَعْر, as many as the days she had to wait<br>\
before she could marry again, and to throw away<br>\
one each day: so that the saying means She threw<br>\
the last piece of بعر.]<br>\

بَعْرٌ (S, A, K) and ↓ بَعَرٌ (Msb, K) [coll. gen. ns.<br>\
signifying Camels&#39;, and sheeps&#39;, and goats&#39;, and<br>\
similar, dung;] dung (Msb, K) of animals having<br>\
the kind of foot called خُفّ, (A, Mgh, Msb, K)<br>\
[i. e.,] of the camel, and also of the sheep and goat,<br>\
(S,) and of cloven-hoofed animals (A, Mgh, Msb,<br>\

أَهْوَنُ عَلَىَّ مِنْ بَعْرَةٍ يُرْمَى بِهَا كَلْبٌ [He is a lighter<br>\
thing to me than a piece of بعر that is thrown at<br>\
a dog]. (A.) And it is said in a prov., أَنْتَ<br>\
كَصَاحِبِ البَعْرَةِ [Thou art like the owner of the<br>\
piece of بعر, or أَنْتَ فِى مِثْلِ صَاحِبِ البَعْرَةِ Thou<br>\
art in a condition like that of the owner of the<br>\
piece of بعر; (meaning the person for whom it<br>\
was intended;) applied to him who reveals a<br>\
thing relating to himself; (see Freytag&#39;s Arab.<br>\
Prov. i. 85;)] originating from the fact that a<br>\
man had a suspicion respecting some one among<br>\
his people; so he collected them to search out<br>\
from them the truth of the case, and took a piece<br>\
of بعر, and said, “I am about to throw this my<br>\
piece of بعر at the person whom I suspect;”<br>\
whereupon one of them withdrew himself quickly,<br>\
and said, “Throw it not at me;” and confessed.<br>\
(TA.) See also بَعَرَتْ, above.<br>\
بَعَرٌ: see بَعْرٌ.<br>\
بِعَارٌ, a subst., [or inf. n. of 3,] The befouling of<br>\
her milker with her dung, by a ewe or she-goat,<br>\
(K,) or a camel: (TA:) it is reckoned a fault,<br>\
because the animal that does so sometimes casts<br>\
her dung into the milking-vessel. (TA.)<br>\
بَعِيرٌ, (S, Msb, K, &amp;c.,) sometimes pronounced<br>\
بَعِيرٌ, (K,) which latter is of the dial. of BenooTemeem, but the former is the more chaste,<br>\
(TA,) A camel, male or female; (S, Msb, K;)<br>\
as applied to a camel, like إِنْسَانٌ applied to a<br>\
human being; (S, Msb;) whereas جَمَلٌ is applied<br>\
only to a male camel, and نَاقَةٌ to a she-camel;<br>\
بَكْرٌ and بَكْرَةٌ are respectively terms like فَتنًى and<br>\
فَتَاةٌ; and قَلُوصٌ is like the term جَارِيَةٌ; so say,<br>\
among others, ISk and Az and IJ; and it is<br>\
added in the Mutahffidh, that the terms جمل<br>\
and ناقة are applied only when the animal has<br>\
entered the seventh year: (Msb:) but بعير is<br>\
more commonly applied to the male camel; (Msb,<br>\
K;) and only to one that has entered its fifth<br>\
year; (S, K;) or that has entered its ninth year:<br>\
(K:) the pl. is أَبْعِرَةٌ [a pl. of pauc.] and بُعْرَانٌ<br>\
(S, Msb, K) and بِعْرَانٌ (K) and بُعُرٌ (TA) and<br>\
(pl. of أَبْعِرَةٌ TA) أَبَاعِرُ (S, Msb, K) and أَبَاعِيرُ<br>\
(K.) If one say, أَعْطُونِى بَعِيرًا [Give ye to me a<br>\
بعير], the persons so addressed, accord. to EshSháfi&#39;ee, are not to give a she-camel: (Msb:)<br>\
but the following phrases are transmitted from<br>\
the Arabs: صَرَعَتْنِى بَعِيرِى My she-camel threw<br>\
me down prostrate: (S, A:) and حَلَبْتُ بَعِيرِى I<br>\
milked my camel: (A, Msb:) and شَرِبْتُ مِنْ لَبَنِ<br>\
بَعِيرِى I drank of the milk of my camel: (S:)<br>\
and كِلَا هٰذِيْنِ البِعْرَيْنِ نَاقَةٌ Each of these two<br>\
camels is a she-camel. (A.) لَيْلَةُ البَعِيرِ [The night<br>\
of the camel], mentioned in a trad. of Jábir,<br>\
means the night in which the Prophet purchased<br>\
of him his camel. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also An ass: (IKh,<br>\
K:) so in the Kur xii. 72; but this signification<br>\
is of rare occurrence: (IKh:) and anything that<br>\
carries: (IKh, K:) so in the Hebrew language<br>\
[165 (see Gen. xlv. 17)]. (TA.)<br>\
بَاعِرٌ A widow throwing the piece of بَعْر; meaning ending the number of days during which she<br>\
has had to wait after the death of her husband<br>\
previously to her being allowed to marry again.<br>\
(A.) [See 1.]<br>\
مَبْعَرٌ and ↓ مِبْعَرٌ [and ↓ مَبْعَرَةٌ (occurring in the<br>\
K in art. خور)] The place [or passage (as is<br>\
shown in the Lexicons in many places)] of the<br>\
بَعْر; [i. e. the rectum; the intestine, or gut, containing the بَعْر;] of any quadruped: (K:) pl.<br>\
مَبَاعِرُ. (TA.) It is said in a prov., إِنَّ هٰذَا الدَّاعِرَ<br>\
مَا زَالَ يَنْحَرُ الأَبَاعِرَ وَ يَنْثِلُ المَبَاعِرَ [Verily this bad<br>\
man has not ceased to slaughter camels and to<br>\
cleanse the intestines containing the dung]. (A,<br>\
TA.)<br>\

مَبْعَرَةٌ: see مَبْعَرٌ<br>\
