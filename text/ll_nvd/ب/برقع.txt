He assumed the guise of such as wear the بُرْقُع;<br>\
(TA;) i. e. صَارَ مَأْبُونًا [he became effeminate,<br>\
or a catamite]. (K, TA.) A poet says,<br>\
أَلَمْ تَرَ قَيْسًا قَيْسَ عَيْلَانَ بَرْقَعَتْ<br>\
لِحَاهَا وَبَاعَتْ نَبْلَهَا بِالمَغَازِلِ<br>\

بُرْقَعٌ: see what next follows.<br>\
بُرْقُعٌ (IAar, S, Mgh, Msb, K) and ↓ بُرْقَعٌ<br>\
(IAar, S, Msb, K ,) but some disallow this latter,<br>\
(Msb,) and ↓ بُرْقُوعٌ, (IAar, S, K,) but AHát<br>\
disallows this, as well as the second, (TA,) A<br>\
thing pertaining to women and to horses or similar<br>\
beasts, (K,) or to horses or similar beasts and to<br>\
the women of the Arabs of the desert; (S;) a<br>\
thing with which a woman veils her face; (Msb;)<br>\
having in it two holes for the eyes: (Lth:) a<br>\
small piece of cloth, or rag, pierced for the eyes,<br>\
worn by horses or similar beasts and by the women<br>\
of the Arabs of the desert: (Mgh:) [or, accord.<br>\
to the general fashion of the present time, a long<br>\
strip of cotton or other cloth, black, blue, or of<br>\
some other colour, or white, concealing the whole<br>\
of the face of the woman wearing it, except the<br>\
eyes, and reaching nearly to the feet, suspended<br>\
at the top by a narrow band, or other fastening,<br>\
which passes up the middle of the forehead, and<br>\
which is sewed, as are also the two upper corners,<br>\
to a band which is tied round the head, beneath<br>\
the head-veil: (see my “ Manners and Customs<br>\
of the Modern Egyptians,” ch. i.:)] ↓ بُرْقَعَةٌ, if<br>\
correct, is a more particular term: (Mgh:) the<br>\
pl. is بَرَاقِعُ. (Lth, Msb.) [See نِقَابٌ.] ―<br>\

The curtain of the door of the Kaabeh.] ―<br>\

also بِرْقِعُ.<br>\
بِرْقَعُ: see what next follows.<br>\
بِرْقَعُ, (S, K, * TA,) imperfectly decl., (S, TA,)<br>\
and ↓ بِرْقَعُ, (Fr, Az, Ibn-&#39;Abbád,) of a rare form,<br>\
like هِجْرَع, (Fr, Az, *) or البِرْقِعُ and ↓ البُرْقُعُ, (K, *<br>\
TA,) but perhaps this last is a mistranscription,<br>\
for بِرْقَعُ, (TA,) a name of The heaven, or sky:<br>\
(Fr:) or the seventh heaven: (AAF, S, K:) or<br>\
the fourth heaven: (Lth, Az, K:) or the first<br>\
heaven; (K;) i. e. the lowest heaven: IDrd<br>\
says, so they assert; and in like manner says<br>\
IF; and he says, the ب is augmentative, the<br>\
radical letters being ر ق ع, for every heaven is<br>\
termed رَقِيعٌ, and the heavens [together] are<br>\
termed أَرْقِعَةٌ: (TA:) or the lowest heaven is<br>\
termed الرَّقِيعُ. (S, TA.) [See an ex. voce سَدِرٌ.]<br>\

the head white. (S, K.)<br>\
غُرَّةٌ مُبَرْقِعَةٌ A blaze, or whiteness, on the face<br>\
of a horse, occupying the whole of his face, except<br>\
that he looks (يَنْظُرُ [for which يُنْظَرُ is erroneously<br>\

[i. e.] this whiteness passing downwards to the<br>\
cheeks without reaching to the eyes. (L, TA.)<br>\
