بَسْلٌ (inf. n. of بَسَلَ, M) is The act of preventing, hindering, withholding, debarring, forbidding, or prohibiting; syn. مَنْعٌ; the primary<br>\
meaning; (Bd in vi. 69;) and إِعْجَالٌ (M, K)<br>\
and حَبْسٌ; (AA, K;) [both syn. with مَنْعٌ;]<br>\
and ↓ إِبْسَالٌ [inf. n. of 4, q. v. infrà,] signifies<br>\
the same. (Bd ubi suprà.) You say, بَسَلَنِي عَنْ<br>\
حَاجَتِى, inf. n. as above, He prevented me from<br>\
accomplishing my want; syn. أَعْجَلَنِى. (M.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
بَسَلَ, (M, K,) aor.<br>\
بَسُلَ, (M,) inf. n. بُسُولٌ, He (a<br>\
man, TA) frowned, contracted his face, or looked<br>\
sternly or austerely or morosely; or, doing so,<br>\
grinned, or displayed his teeth; or contracted<br>\
the part between his eyes; (عَبَسَ;) by reason of<br>\
courage, or of anger; as also ↓ تبسّل: (M, K:)<br>\
and [so in the M, but in the K “or” ] ↓ تبسّل<br>\
وَجْهُهُ, (M, and so in some copies of the K,) or<br>\
↓ تبسّل [alone], (so in other copies of the K, and<br>\
in the TA,) His face, or he, was, or became,<br>\
odious, and excessively foul or unseemly or hideous,<br>\
in aspect: (M, K:) and لِى ↓ تبسّل He (a man)<br>\
was displeasing, or odious, in aspect to me. (TA.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b2-  And [hence], (M, K,) inf. n. بُسُولٌ, (TA,)<br>\
said of milk, and of نَبِيذ [or must &amp;c.], (tropical:) It was,<br>\
or became, strong: (K: [in the CK, بَسَّلَ is here<br>\
erroneously put for بَسَلَ; and وَبَسَّلَهُ, which should<br>\
next follow, is omitted:]) or, said of the former,<br>\
it was, or became, displeasing, or odious, in taste,<br>\
and sour; and, said of the latter, it was, or<br>\
became, strong, and sour. (M, TA.) Also, said<br>\

[respecting which latter see what follows in the<br>\
next sentence,] (M, K,) He was, or became, courageous, or strong-hearted, on the occasion of war,<br>\
or fight: (S, M, Msb, K:) from بَسْلٌ meaning<br>\
“forbidden,” or “prohibited;” because he who<br>\
has this quality defends himself from his antagonist, as though it were forbidden to him [the<br>\
latter] to do him a displeasing, or an evil, deed.<br>\
(Ham p. 13.) El-Hoteíah says,<br>\
وَأَحْلَى مِنَ التَّمْرِ الجَنِىِّ وَ فِيهِمُ<br>\
بَسَالَةُ نَفْسٍ إِنْ أُرِيدَ بَسَالُهَا<br>\
[And sweeter than fresh-gathered dates, and in<br>\
them is courageousness of soul, if courageousness<br>\
thereof be desired]: but بسالها may be here altered<br>\
