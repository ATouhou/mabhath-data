-b5-  Anything with which a thing is rendered cold,<br>\
or cooled. (S, M.) ―<br>\
-b6-  A collyrium which cools<br>\
the eye; (Lth, T, M, Msb;) also termed بَرُودُ<br>\
العَيْنِ. (T, S.) ―<br>\
-b7-  بَرُودُ الظِّلِّ (assumed tropical:) Pleasant in social<br>\
intercourse: applied alike to the male and the<br>\
female. (TA, from a trad.) ―<br>\
-b8-  ثَوْبٌ بَرُودٌ A garment without nap: (K:) and a garment that is<br>\
not warm nor soft. (TA.)<br>\
بَرِيدٌ: see بَرُودٌ.<br>\
-A2-  Also A mule appointed [for<br>\
the conveyance of messengers] in a رِبَاط [or public<br>\
building for the accommodation of travellers and<br>\
their beasts, or in a سِكَّة, which is a house or the<br>\
like specially appropriated to messengers and the<br>\
beasts that carry them: thus it signifies a postmule: afterwards, it was applied also to a posthorse, and any beast appointed for the conveyance<br>\
of messengers]: (Mgh:) [this is what is meant<br>\
by the words in the S and K, البَرِيدُ المُرَتَّبُ:] it<br>\
is a word of Persian origin, (Z in the Fáïk,)<br>\
arabicized, from بُرِيدَهْ دُمْ, (Z in the Fáïk, and<br>\
Mgh,) i. e. “docked,” or “having the tail cut<br>\
off;” for the post-mules (بِغَالُ البَرِيدِ) had their<br>\
tails cut off in order that they might be known:<br>\
(Z in the Fáïk:) [or perhaps it is from the<br>\
Hebrew<br>\
פֶּרֶד “a mule:”] or it is applied to the<br>\
beast appointed for the conveyance of messengers<br>\
(دَابَّةُ البَرِيدِ) because he traverses the space called<br>\
بَرِيد [defined below: but the reason before given<br>\
for this appellation is more probable: it is like<br>\
the Lat. “veredus”]: (T, Msb:) pl. بُرُدٌ (Z, Mgh,<br>\
Msb) and بُرْدٌ, which is a contraction of the former,<br>\
like as رُسْلٌ is of رُسُلٌ. (Z.) You say, حُمِلَ فُلَانٌ<br>\
عَلَى البَرِيِد [Such a one was borne on the postmule or post-horse]. (S.) Imra-el-Keys speaks<br>\
of a بريد of the horses of Barbar. (S.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Having<br>\
been originally used in the sense first explained<br>\
above, it was afterwards applied to A messenger<br>\
borne on a post-mule [or post-horse]: (Z in the<br>\
Fáïk, and Mgh:) or messengers on beasts of the<br>\
post: (M, K:) or a messenger that journeys with<br>\
haste: (A:) or [simply] a messenger: (S, Msb,<br>\
K:) pl. as above. (M, * Z.) Hence the saying,<br>\
الحُمَّى بَرِيدُ المَوْتِ Fever is the messenger of<br>\
death: (T, Msb:) because it gives warning thereof.<br>\
(T.) Hence also البَرِيدُ applied to The animal<br>\
called الفُرَانِقُ, (said to be the jackal, but some say<br>\
otherwise, TA,) because he gives warning before<br>\
[the approach of] the lion. (T, S, K.) And<br>\
صَاحِبُ البَرِيِد [The master of the messengers that<br>\
journey on post-mules or post-horses]. (S.) [And<br>\
خَيْلٌ البَرِيِد, occurring in many histories &amp;c., The<br>\
post-horses, that carry messengers and others.] ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also, having been applied to a messenger on a<br>\
post-mule [or post-horse], it then became applied<br>\
to The space, or distance, traversed by the messenger thus called; (Mgh, Msb; *) the space, or<br>\
distance, between each سِكَّة and the سِكَّة next to it;<br>\
the سكّة being a structure of either of the kinds<br>\
called بَيْت and قُبَّة, or a رِبَاط [explained above],<br>\
in which the appointed messengers lodge; (Z in<br>\
the Fáïk;) the space, or distance, between two<br>\
stations, or places of alighting; or two parasangs,<br>\
or leagues; (M, K;) [six miles;] each parasang,<br>\
or league, being three miles, and each mile being<br>\
four thousand cubits: (TA:) or twelve miles;<br>\
(S, A, Msb, K;) i. e. four parasangs, or leagues:<br>\
(Mgh, TA:) [for] the space, or distance, between each station termed سِكَّة and the next to<br>\
it is either two parasangs or four: (Z in the<br>\
Fáïk:) the distance of twelve miles is [also]<br>\
termed سِكَّةُ البَرِيِد: (T:) the pl. is as above. (T,<br>\
Z.) A journey of four بُرُد, or forty-eight miles,<br>\
renders it allowable to shorten prayers; which<br>\
miles are of the Háshimee measure, such as are<br>\
measured on the road to Mekkeh. (T.) ―<br>\
-b4-  Also<br>\
The course, or pace, of a camel along the space<br>\
thus called: so in the following verse of Muzarrid,<br>\
in praise of &#39;Arábeh El-Owsee:<br>\
فَدَتْكَ عَرَابَ اليَوْمَ أُمِّى وَ خَالَتِى<br>\
وَ نَاقَتِىَ النَّاجِى إِلَيْكَ بَرِيدُهَا<br>\
[May my mother, and my maternal aunt, and<br>\
my she-camel that is swift in her course to thee<br>\
from one station to another, be ransoms for thee,<br>\
O &#39;Arábeh, (the name being contracted,) this day!].<br>\

upon which mugs (كِيزَان, pl. of كُوز,) are placed;<br>\
erroneously in the K, كُوَّارَةٌ, and كُوَارَةٌ, as I find<br>\
it in different copies;] upon which water is cooled:<br>\
(Lth, T, K: *) but [Az says,] I know not whether<br>\
it be a classical or a post-classical word. (T.)<br>\

mugs passed the night upon the برّادة. (A, TA.)<br>\
بَارِدٌ (S, M, Msb, K) Cold; chill; cool; (S,<br>\
