بَدَأَ بِهِ, (T, S, M, &amp;c.,) aor.<br>\
بَدَاَ, (Mgh, K,)<br>\
inf. n. بَدْءٌ, (T, S, M, Msb,) i. q. به ↓ ابتدأ; (S,<br>\
Msb, K;) [He began with it;] he made it to<br>\
have precedence, or to be first; gave precedence<br>\
to it; syn. قَدَّمَهُ: (Mgh, Msb:) in the dial. of<br>\
the Ansár, بَدِئَ به is used in this sense of قدّمه;<br>\
(M;) or بَدِىَ به [without ء]; (IKtt, TA; [see<br>\
بَدةءٌ;]) [and بَدَى به; see art. بدى;] and به ↓ ابدأ<br>\
signifies the same. (Msb.) [So in the Kur xii. 76,<br>\
فَبَدَأَ بِأَوْعِيَتِهِمْ قَبْلَ وِعَآءِ أَخِيهِ And he began with<br>\
their bags, before the bags of his brother. And<br>\
بَدَأَهُ is sometimes used in the sense of بَدَأَ بِهِ;<br>\
whence, in the Kur ix. 13, وَهُمْ بَدَؤُوكُمْ أَوَّلَ مَرَّةٍ<br>\
And they, it was, began with you the first time;<br>\
i. e., as Bd says, by acting with hostility, and<br>\
fighting.] You say also, بَدَّا ثُمَّ عَادَ He began, or<br>\
did a first time, or the first time: then repeated,<br>\
or did a second time. (Az, TA in art. عود.) And<br>\
بَدَأَ فِىِ الأَمْرِ [He began, or made a beginning, in<br>\
the affair.] (M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  بَدَأَ also signifies It (a thing)<br>\
began; began to be; originated; or came into<br>\
existence. (Msb.) [See also 5.]<br>\
-A2-  بَدَأَ الشَّيْءَ,<br>\
(S, M, K,) aor. and inf. n. as above, (M,) [He<br>\
began the thing; commenced it; set about it; as<br>\
also ↓ ابتدأهُ: accord. to the Mgh, the latter has<br>\
this meaning, or, agreeably with the authority of<br>\
the M and K, the meaning which here next<br>\
follows:] he did the thing first, for the first time,<br>\
by way of beginning, or originally; (S, M, K;)<br>\
as also ↓ ابدأهُ and ↓ ابتدأهُ; (M, K;) i. e., not<br>\
after the example of anything preceding. (TA.<br>\
[But this addition seems rather to belong to another explanation to be mentioned below.]) One<br>\
does not say, زَيْدًا ↓ ابتدأ nor بَدَأَهُ, because these<br>\
two verbs [signifying as last explained above]<br>\
do not have for their objects corporeal things.<br>\
(Mgh.) [El-Mutanakhkhil El-Hudhalee uses the<br>\
phrase سَأَبْدُؤُهُمْ بِمَشْمَعِةٍ I will begin with them<br>\
(meaning his guests) by sporting and jesting;<br>\
like the phrase in the Kur ix. 13 cited above:<br>\
but different from these is the saying in the Kur<br>\
xxxii. 6, وَبَدَأَ خَلْقِ الْإِنْسَانِ مِنْ طِينٍ And He<br>\
began the creation of man from clay.] The<br>\
saying, ↓ فَإِنْ كَانَ السَّبُعُ ابْتَدَأَهُ means ابتدأ أَخْذَهُ<br>\
أَوْ عَضَّهُ [But if the beast, or bird, of prey has<br>\
begun the seizing of him, or the biting of him];<br>\
the noun that is prefixed [to the pronoun] being<br>\
suppressed. (Mgh.) You say also, كَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى<br>\
الأَمْرِ ↓ ابْتِدَآءِ That was in the beginning, or first,<br>\
of the affair. (Msb.) [See also بَدْءٌ, below.] ―<br>\
-b2-<br>\
He originated the thing; brought it into being<br>\
or existence; made it, or produced it, for the<br>\
first time, it not having been before; (Mgh;)<br>\
[and] so ↓ ابدأهُ, said [of God, and] of a man, as<br>\
the agent; (Msb;) and ↓ ابتدأهُ. (Mgh in art.<br>\
بدع.) [Hence,] بَدَأَ اللّٰهُ الخَلْقَ, and ↓ أَبْدَأَهُمْ, God<br>\
created, or brought into existence, mankind, or<br>\
the created beings: (M, Msb, K:) both signify<br>\
the same. (S.) البَاطِلُ وَمَا يُعِيدُ ↓ مَا يُبْدِئُ [in<br>\
the Kur xxxiv. 48, means What doth that which<br>\
is false, or the Devil, originate, or produce in the<br>\
first instance? and what doth it, or he, reproduce<br>\
after it hath perished?]: Zj says that مَا, here, is<br>\
in the place of an accus., meaning in each Instance<br>\
أَىَّ شَىْءٍ: or it may be a negative; and الباطل<br>\
here is Iblees; i. e., Iblees createth not, nor<br>\
raiseth to life after death. (M.) You say also,<br>\
وَمَا يُعِيدُ ↓ مَا يُبْدِئُ, meaning وَلَا ↓ مَا يَتَكَلَّمُ<br>\
عَائِدَةٍ, (S, K,) i. e. He does not say anything for<br>\
the first time, nor anything for the second time;<br>\
or anything original, nor anything in the way of<br>\
repetition; الكَلَامِ ↓ بَادِئَةُ signifying what is said<br>\
for the first time; and عَائِدَةُ الكَلَامِ, what is said<br>\
for the second time, afterwards: (TA:) or he<br>\
says not anything: (A in art. عود:) and he has<br>\
no art, artifice, or cunning. (IAar, TA in art.<br>\
عود; and A in the present art.) ―<br>\
-b3-  بَدَأَ البِئْرَ He<br>\
dug the well [for the first time: see بَدِىْءٌ].<br>\
(Msb.)<br>\
-A3-  بَدَأَ مِنْ أَرْضٍ إِلَى أَرْضٍ, (T,) or مِنْ أَرْضِهِ,<br>\
(K,) He went forth from a land to a land, or<br>\
from his land; as also ↓ ابدأ. (T, K.)<br>\
-A4-  بُدِئَ,<br>\
(inf. n. as above, S, M, K,) He (a man, S, M)<br>\
had the small-pox: (AZ, As, T, S, M, K:) or the<br>\
حَصْبَة [i. e. measles, or spotted fever]: (S, M, K:)<br>\
or, as AZ says, and the حصبة: (T:) or, as Lh<br>\
says, there came forth upon him pustules resembling the small-pox: but he adds, some say, the<br>\
small-pox itself: (M:) the epithet applied to a<br>\
person affected therewith is ↓ مَبْدُوْءٌ. (AZ, As,<br>\
Lh, T, S, M.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He fell sick. (IAth, TA.)<br>\
In a trad. of &#39; Áïsheh occur the words, فِى اليَوْمِ<br>\
الَّذِى بُدِئَ فِيهِ رَسُولِ اللّٰهِ [meaning In the day in<br>\
which the Apostle of God fell sick]: and IAth<br>\
says, مَتَى بُدِئَ فُلَانٌ meaning When did such a<br>\
one fall sick? is a phrase used in inquiring<br>\
respecting the living [who has been attacked by<br>\
illness] and respecting the dead. (TA.)<br>\
4<br>\
ابدأ: see 1, in seven places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also He<br>\
did a new thing; a thing unknown before; or a<br>\
strange, or wonderful, thing. (S, * TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  And<br>\
He voided excrement, or ordure; or broke wind;<br>\
syn. نَجَا; [as also أَبْدَى;] said of a man. (M.)<br>\
―<br>\
-b4-  And He put forth his second teeth; said of a<br>\
child; (M;) and of a colt. (TA voce أَحْفَرَ, q. v.)<br>\
5<br>\
تبدّأ He, or it, began, or made a beginning.<br>\
(KL.) [See also 1. Golius mentions, but without<br>\
giving the authority, and without the vowel-signs,<br>\
the saying, هَاتِ القِصَّةَ مِنْ ذِى تُبُدِّئَتْ; but writing<br>\
the last word تبديت, stating only that it is in the<br>\
passive form; as meaning Relate thou the story,<br>\
or history, from the beginning.]<br>\
8<br>\
إِبْتَدَاَ see 1, in seven places. ―<br>\
-b2-  ابتدأهُ بِوَعْدٍ He<br>\
made him a promise in anticipation; without his<br>\
asking it of him. (M in art. انف.)<br>\
بَدءٌ inf.n. of 1; (T, S, M, Msb;) [The act of<br>\
beginning;] or the doing a thing first. (M.) You<br>\
say, لَكَ البَدْءُ, (M, K,) and ↓ البُدْءُ, (As, TA,) and<br>\
↓ البَدْأَةُ, (S, M, Msb, K,) and ↓ البُدْأَةُ, (S, M, K,)<br>\
and ↓ البِدْأَةُ, (L,) and ↓ البَدَآءَةُ, (M, K,) and<br>\
↓ البُدَآءَةُ, (S, M, K,) and البُدَاهَةُ, with ه substituted for ء, (M, Mtr,) and ↓ البِدَآءَةُ, (Mtr, TA,)<br>\
and, accord. to IKtt, البِدَايَةُ, but see what follows,<br>\
(TA,) and ↓ البَدِئَةُ, (M, K,) and ↓ البُدَّآءَةُ, (AZ,<br>\
TA,) It is for thee to begin, (S, M, Msb, K,)<br>\
before any other, in shooting or casting, &amp;c.:<br>\
(S:) as to البِدَايَةُ, mentioned above, accord. to<br>\
Mtr [and Fei], (TA,) it is a vulgar word, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb, TA,) as IB and several others have stated,<br>\
(Msb, TA, *) a corruption of ↓ البِدَآءَةُ, (Mgh,<br>\
Msb,) signifying the first; as also ↓ البُدَآءَةُ; and<br>\
↓ البَدْأَةُ: (Msb:) but IKtt says that it is a word<br>\
of the dial. of the Ansár; بَدَأْتُ بِالشَّىْءِ and بَدِيتُ<br>\
بِهِ signifying قَدَّمْتُهُ: [see 1:] and he cites the<br>\
following verse of Ibn-Rawáhah:<br>\
وَلَوْ عَبَدْنَا غَيْرَهُ شَقِينَا  بِاسْمِ الْإِلَاهِ وَ بِهِ بَدِينَا<br>\
[In the name of God, and with it we begin; and<br>\
if we worshipped any other than Him, we should<br>\
be miserable]: see art. بدى. (TA. [This verse<br>\
is also cited in the S in art. بدو, where, in one<br>\
copy I find it as above; in another, with بَدَيْنَا<br>\
instead of بَدِيْنَا.]) And you say, فَعَلَهُ عَوْذَا وَبَدْءًا,<br>\
(T, S,) and عَوْدَهُ عَلَي بَدْئِهِ, (M,) and فِى عَوْدِهِ<br>\
وَبَدْئِهِ, and ↓ فِى عَوْدَتِهِ وَبَدْأَتِهِ, (S, M,) [He did<br>\
it returning and beginning again; or returning<br>\
to his beginning; i. e. he did it again from the<br>\
beginning; he recommenced it: or you say this]<br>\
meaning like as is meant by the saying next following. (TA.) رَجَعَ عَوْدَهُ عَلَى بَدْئِهِ, (S, K,) and<br>\
عَوْدًا عَلَى بَدْءٍ, in both of which [and in the last<br>\
following] the verb may be trans., and the noun<br>\
following therefore in the accus. case, (TA,) and<br>\
فِى عَوْدِهِ وَبَدْئِهِ, and ↓ فِى عَوْدَتِهِ وَبَدْأَتِهِ, [in both<br>\
of which, if correct, the verb must be intrans.,]<br>\
and عَوْدًا وَبَدْءًا, [as though meaning عَائِدًا وَبَادِئًا,<br>\
used as a phrase denotative of state,] (K,) [but<br>\
in this last, and the two next preceding, accord.<br>\
to the TA, the verb should be فَعَلَهُ, as in the<br>\
next preceding sentence, instead of رَجَعَ, and this<br>\
is confirmed by what is said in the K in art. عود,]<br>\
He returned in the way whence he had come:<br>\
(S, K:) [accord. to the TA, the literal meaning<br>\
of the first and second may be he made his returning to revert to his beginning, and he made a<br>\
returning to revert to a beginning:] or the meaning of the first, (Sb, TA in art. عود, and K in<br>\
that art.,) and of the second, (K in that art.,) is,<br>\
he returned without stopping after he had gone<br>\
away: (Sb, K:) and sometimes it signifies the<br>\
stopping in one&#39;s coming and then returning:<br>\
(Sb:) [and it returned to its first state; it recommenced:] and you say, رَجَعْتُ عَوْدِى عَلَى<br>\
بَدْئِى, meaning I returned like as I had come.<br>\
(Sb ubi suprà.) ―<br>\
-b2-  Also First, or former; preceding all others, or preceding another; as also<br>\
↓ البَدْءُ بَدِىْءٌ; and البَدِىءُ being syn. with الأَوَّلُ.<br>\
(S, K.) Hence the saying, اِفْعَلْهُ بَادِى بَدْءٍ, and<br>\
↓ بَادِى بَدِىْءٍ, meaning Do thou it the first thing,<br>\
or the first of everything; [accord. to different<br>\
copies of the S;] the ى in بادى being quiescent,<br>\
in the place of the accus. case, accord. to usage;<br>\
and sometimes they omit the [altogether], on<br>\
account of frequent use [of the phrase], as will<br>\
be stated in art. بدو, (S in the present art.,) saying بَادِى بَدٍ, and بَادِىبَدِى (S in art. بدو.)<br>\
You say also, اِفْعَلْهُ بَدْءًا, and أَوَّلَ بَدْءٍ, (Th, M,<br>\
K,) and بَدْءَ بَدْءٍ, (CK,) and بَدَا بَدْءٍ, (M, K,)<br>\
and بَدْءٍ ↓ بَادِئَ, (A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, K,) and<br>\
بَادِىَ بَدٍ, (K,) and بَادِىْ بَدًا, (M, K, [in the CK<br>\
بَادِىْ بَدٍ,]) and بَادِىْ بَدًا, (M,) and بَدِىْءٍ ↓ بَادَئَ,<br>\
(K,) and بَادِىْ بَدَا, (M, K,) and ↓ بَدِىْءٍ ↓ بَادِئَ,<br>\
(A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, M, CK,) and بَدِىٍّ ↓ بَادِئَ, which<br>\
is anomalous, (M,) or بَادِىَ بَدِّىِ, (K,) and بَادِىْ<br>\
بَدِيٍّ, (Fr, A&#39;Obeyd, T, S, M,) and ↓ بَدِئٍ ↓ بَادِئَ,<br>\
(S, CK,) or ↓ بَادِىَ بَدِئٍ, (K, TA,) and بَادِىْ<br>\
↓ بَدْأَةَ, (M, K, TA,) the former word being the<br>\
act. part. n. of بَدِىَ, which is of the dial. of the<br>\
Ansár, as mentioned above, and the latter being<br>\
indecl., with fet-h for its termination, (TA, [in<br>\
the CK the latter word is written بَدْءَة,]) and<br>\
بَدْءٍ ↓ بَدْأَةَ, (CK,) and ↓ بَدْأَةَ بَدْأَةَ, (M, K,) and<br>\
↓ بَدِىْءٍ ↓ بَدْأَةَ, (S,) and بَدْءٍ ↓ بَدِىْءَ, (S, CK,) and<br>\
بَدْءَ ذِى بَدْءٍ, (Fr, T,) and ذِى بَدْءٍ ↓ بَدْأَةَ, (Fr, T,<br>\
S, K,) and ↓ بَدْأَةَ ذِى بَدْأَةٍ, and ↓ ذِى بَدِىْءٍ ↓ بَدْأَةَ,<br>\
(S, K,) and ↓ ذِي بَدَآءَةَ ↓ بَدَأَةَ, (K, TA,) not بداءة<br>\
[as in the CK], (TA,) and ↓ بَدِىْءَ ذِى بَدِىْءٍ, (S,<br>\
K, TA, [in the CK the last word is written بَدْءٍ,])<br>\
and ↓ ذِى بَدِىْءٍ ↓ بَدَآءَةِ, (K,) meaning Do thou<br>\
it the first thing; (Fr, T, K;) so in a correct<br>\
copy [of the K, and so I find in a MS. copy of<br>\
the K and in the CK]: accord. to another copy,<br>\
the first of everything: (TA:) or the first of<br>\
first; (S;) thus in the L: (TA:) the words<br>\
here put in the accus. case [literally or virtually]<br>\
are so put [in some instances] as adverbial nouns;<br>\
or, accord. to MF, they may be [in some instances]<br>\
denotatives of state, with respect to the agent;<br>\
the meaning being اِفْعَلْهُ حَالَةَ كَوْنِكَ بَادِئًا, i. e.<br>\
مُبْتَدِئَا بِهِ [lit. do thou it in the state of thy being<br>\
beginning it]. (TA.) [In like manner,] you also<br>\
say, بَدْءَ الرَّأْىِ, and [more commonly] الرَّأْىِ ↓ بَادِئَ,<br>\
At first thought; or on the first opinion: (Lh,<br>\
M:) [بَدْءُ الرَّأْىِ and] الرَّأْىِ ↓ بَادِئُ signifying the<br>\
first, and beginning, of the idea, thought, opinion,<br>\
or judgment; or what is perceived before considering well or thoroughly: (M:) [and بَدْءٌ alone<br>\
signifying a first idea, thought, opinion, or judgment; as is implied in the A, voce صَيُّورٌ, q. v.:]<br>\
hence, الرَّأْيِ ↓ فَعَلَهُ فِى بَادِئِ [He did it at first<br>\
thought, &amp;c.]: (M:) and الرَّأْىِ تُرِيدُ ↓ أَنْتَ بَادِئَ<br>\
ظُلْمَنَا, and الرأى ↓ مُبْتَدَأَ, i.e. Thou at first<br>\
thought, &amp;c., desirest to wrong us: and one says<br>\
also, بَادِىَ الرأى, without; meaning on the occasion of what appeared of opinion; i. e. at the<br>\
first of what appeared thereof; [or at the first<br>\
opinion&#39;s presenting itself;;] in which case, the<br>\
phrase does not belong to this art. [but to art.<br>\
بدو]: it occurs in the Kur xi. 29: (M:) AA<br>\
alone there read بَادِئَ, with; all the other<br>\
readers pronounced it without ء (TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  Also<br>\
A chief, or lord, (S, M, Msb, K,) who occupies<br>\
the first place in chieftainship or lordship: (S:)<br>\
or, as some say, a youth, or young man, whose<br>\
judgment, or opinion, is deemed good, and who<br>\
is consulted: (M:) or it signifies also an intelligent youth or young man: (K:) pl. بُدُوْءٌ. (M.)<br>\
A poet (namely, Ows Ibn-Maghrà Es-Saadee,<br>\
TA) says,<br>\
ثُنْيَانُنَا إِنْ أَتَاهُمْ كَانَ بَدْأَهُمُ<br>\
وَبَدْؤُهُمْ إِنْ أَتَانَا كِانَ ثُنْيَانَا<br>\
[Our second chief, if he came to them, would<br>\
be their first chief; and their first chief, if he<br>\
came to us, would be a second chief]. (S.) ―<br>\
-b4-<br>\
Also, and ↓ بَدْأَةٌ, A share, or portion, of a<br>\
slaughtered camel: (S, K:) or the best share<br>\
or portion thereof: (T:) or the former word has<br>\
the latter signification; and the latter word, the<br>\
former signification: and the former signifies also<br>\
a bone with the meat, or flesh, that is on it: (M:)<br>\
and a joint; syn. مَفْصِلٌ; (AA, T, M;) and so<br>\
بَدًا q.v.: (AA, T:) the pl. [of pauc.] of بَدْءٌ<br>\
is أَبْدَآءٌ (S, M, K) and [of mult.] بُدُوْءٌ; (S, K;)<br>\
the former of which is the more common: (TA:)<br>\
or this is pl. of بَدًا. (AA, T.) The shares abovementioned [as commonly divided for the game<br>\
called المَيْسِر q. v.] are ten; namely, the two<br>\
haunches, the two thighs properly so called, the<br>\
two thighs commonly so called (i. e. the tibiæ),<br>\
the two shoulders, and the two arms; which<br>\
last are the worst, because of the many veins<br>\
[therein]. (TA.) ―<br>\

بُدءٌ: see بَدْءٌ; second sentence.<br>\
بَدِئٌ: see بَادِئَ بَدِئٍ, or بَادِىَ بَدِئٍ, voce بَدءٌ.<br>\
بَدْأَةٌ: see بَدْءٌ, in thirteen places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also The<br>\
beginning, or outward course, of a military expedition; opposed to رَجْعَةٌ, meaning the returning,<br>\
or homeward course, thereof: occurring in a<br>\
trad., in which it is said that the Prophet gave,<br>\
in the case of the former, a fourth [of the spoil],<br>\
and in the case of the latter, a third; i.e., when<br>\
a troop went forth from the main body of the<br>\
army and attacked a party of the enemy, they<br>\
were to have a fourth of the spoil that they took,<br>\
and the rest of the army was to share with them<br>\
the remaining three fourths; and if a troop did so<br>\
in returning, they were to have a third of all<br>\
the spoil that they took, because of the greater<br>\
difficulty and danger attending this case. (T,<br>\
Mgh.) ―<br>\
-b3-  كَانَ ذٰلِكَ فِى بَدْأَتِنَا, and ↓ بُدْأَتِنَا, and<br>\
↓ بِدْأَتِنَا, (K,) and ↓ بَدَآءَتِنَا, (Lh, M, TA,) and<br>\
↓ بُدَآءَتِنَا, and ↓ بِدَآءَتِنَا, (TA,) and ↓ بَدَأَتِنَا,<br>\
(Lh, M, K,) but [ISd says,] I know not how<br>\

and ↓ مَبْدَأَتِنَا, (Lh, M, and so in some copies<br>\
of the K,) or مَبْدَاتِنَا, (so in other copies of the<br>\
K,) thus in the بَاهِر of Ibn-&#39;Odeys [in the CK<br>\
Ibn-&#39;Adebbes], (K,) which is said to indicate that<br>\
we should hesitate respecting them [before admitting them to be of classical authority], are phrases<br>\
meaning That was in the first of our state, and<br>\
in our adolescence. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  Also, (so in a copy<br>\
of the M, there written بَدْأَة,) or ↓ بُدْأَةٌ, with<br>\
damm, (K,) A certain plant; (M;) a black<br>\
thing, resembling a truffle (كَمْء), of which no<br>\
use is made: so says AHn. (M.)<br>\
بُدْأَةٌ: see بَدْءٌ; second sentence: and see بَدْأَةٌ,<br>\
in two places.<br>\
بِدْأَةٌ: see بَدْءٌ; second sentence: and see بَدْأَةٌ<br>\

(M.)<br>\
بَدِىْءٌ: see بَدْءٌ, as signifying First, or former;<br>\
in eight places. ―<br>\
-b2-  Also, applied to a thing, or<br>\
an affair, i. q بَدِيعٌ, (S, and so in a copy of the<br>\
K,) or مُبْدَعٌ: (so in other copies of the K:)<br>\
[thus it signifies] Originated; brought into being<br>\
or existence; made, or produced, for the first<br>\
time, not having been before, or not after the<br>\
similitude of any former thing: (TA:) and<br>\
created: (M, K:) and wonderful: (M, Msb,<br>\
TA:) and strange, or extraordinary, as not<br>\
being after the similitude of any former thing.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b3-  [Hence, as is implied in the Mgh,]<br>\
بِئْرٌ بَدِىْءٌ A well newly dug; (T, Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
i. q. بَدِيعٌ; (M;) or dug since the era of ElIslám (S, K;) not ancient; (S, Mgh, Msb;)<br>\
as also ↓ بَدْءٌ: (S:) the former epithet [in this<br>\
sense] is generally pronounced [بَدِىٌّ] without ء:<br>\
(T:) the well thus called is one dug in a waste<br>\
land that has no owner: (TA:) AO says, (TA,)<br>\
this epithet, and بَدِيع, are applied to a well when<br>\
thou hast dug it; but if thou findest it to have<br>\
been dug before thee, it is termed خَفِيَّة; and<br>\
thus the well of Zemzem is termed خفيّة, because<br>\
it was Ismá&#39;eel&#39;s, and was filled up or covered<br>\
over [after his time]: (T, TA:) the term قَلِيب is<br>\
[said to be] applied to an ancient well of which<br>\
