بَرْطَلَ, (inf. n. بَرْطَلَةٌ, TK,) He placed a<br>\
long stone (بِرْطِيلٌ) in the fore part (إِزَآء, q. v.,)<br>\
of his watering-trough. (Lth, K.)<br>\
-A2-  [He gave<br>\
him a بِرْطِيل, or bribe;] he bribed him. (K.)<br>\
And بُرْطِلَ He was bribed. (TA.)<br>\
Q. 2<br>\
تَبَرْطَلَ He received a [بِرْطِيل, or] bribe.<br>\
(K.)<br>\
بِرْطِيلٌ A long stone: pl. بَرَاطِيلٌ: (S:) or a<br>\
broad stone: (TA in art. برم:) or a stone (Seer,<br>\
A, K) of an oblong form (A, TA) a cubit in<br>\
length, (Seer, TA,) or an iron, long, broad, and<br>\
hard by nature, (K,) not such as is made long, or<br>\
sharpened or made sharp-pointed, by men, (TA,)<br>\
with which the millstone is pecked (تُنْقَرُ [i. e.,<br>\
wrought into shape, and roughened in its surface,<br>\
by pecking]): so says Lth: (TA:) to this is<br>\
sometimes likened the muzzle, or fore part of the<br>\
nose and mouth, of a she-camel of high breed:<br>\
(Lth, TA:) [and hence,] it signifies also (assumed tropical:)  the<br>\
muzzle, or fore part of the nose and mouth, of an<br>\
old bear: (TA:) some say that the dual signifies<br>\
two elongated stones, of the hardest kind, slender,<br>\
and sharp-pointed, with which the millstone is<br>\
pecked (تُنْقَرُ [explained above]). (TA.) Also,<br>\
(K,) accord. to Sh, (TA,) A pickaxe, or stonecutter&#39;s pick; syn. مِعْوَلٌ: (Sh, Msb, K:) pl. as<br>\
above: accord. to IAar, what is called in Persian<br>\
اسكنه [app. a mistranscription, or a dial. var., of<br>\
إِسْكَنك]. (TA.)<br>\
-A2-  A bribe; syn. رِشْوَةٌ: (Msb,<br>\
K:) app. mentioned in the K as an Arabic word;<br>\
and if so, the pronunciation with fet-h to the ب<br>\
is a vulgarism, since there is no such measure as<br>\
فَعْلِيلٌ: Abu-l-&#39;Alà El-Ma&#39;arree says that it is not<br>\
known in this sense in the [classical] language of<br>\
the Arabs; and it seems as though it were taken<br>\
from the same word signifying “an oblong stone;”<br>\
as though the bribe were likened to a stone that<br>\
is thrown: (TA:) or it seems as though it were<br>\
taken from the same word signifying a مِعْوَل;<br>\
because therewith a thing is got out; (Msb;) and<br>\
so El-Munáwee asserts it to be: (TA:) pl. as<br>\
above. (Msb, K.) Hence the phrase, أَلْقَمَهُ البِرْطِيلَ<br>\
[He tipt him the bribe; conveyed it to him in like<br>\
manner as one puts a morsel into another&#39;s mouth;<br>\
somewhat like our phrase he greased his fist].<br>\
(TA.) And the saying, البَرَاطِيلُ تَنْصُرُ الأَبَاطِيلِ<br>\
[Bribes render victorious false allegations]: (Msb,<br>\
TA:) a prov. (Msb.)<br>\
مُبَرْطِلُ الرَّأْسِ A man having a long head. (A<br>\
in art. كوز.)<br>\
