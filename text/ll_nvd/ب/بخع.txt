(Z in the Ksh, and TA;) Bd says, lying within<br>\
the فَقَار [or vertebræ]; but it is said that this is<br>\
a mistranscription, and that the right reading is<br>\
the قفا, as in the Ksh; and it is said in the K to<br>\
be running into the bone [or, as in the CK,<br>\
bones,] of the neck; but this is a mistake: (TA:)<br>\
accord. to an assertion of Z, (K,) in his Fáïk and<br>\
Ksh, (TA,) it is different from the نُخَاع, with ن,<br>\
which is the white cord in the interior of the bone<br>\
of the neck, extending to the back-bone: but<br>\
IA th says, I have searched long in lexicons, and<br>\
in books of medicine and anatomy, but have not<br>\
found البخاع, with ب, mentioned in any of them.<br>\
(TA.)<br>\
فَلَعَلَّكَ بَاخِعٌ نَفْسَكَ, in the Kur [xviii. 5], (S,)<br>\
means (tropical:)  And may-be thou wilt kill CCC thyself (S, K)<br>\
with grief, (S,) being beyond measure eager for<br>\
their becoming Muslims. (K, TA.) These words<br>\
imply an incitement to abstain from regret. (B.)<br>\
أَبْخَعُ [More, and most, effectual to kill, and<br>\
destroy]. (K voce أَخْنَعُ, q. v.) ―<br>\
