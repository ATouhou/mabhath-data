ابسن, said of a man, He was, or became<br>\
good, or beautiful, in respect of his سَجِيَّة [i. e.<br>\
natural disposition], accord. to the copies of the<br>\
K, but correctly, as explained by IAar, his سَحْنَة<br>\
[i. e. aspect, or colour, &amp;c.]. (TA.)<br>\
بَسَنٌ an imitative sequent to حَسَنٌ: (S, M, K:)<br>\
[or it may signify Beautiful in aspect &amp;c., from<br>\
the verb above; or the verb may be from this<br>\
word:] or, in the opinion of Aboo-&#39;Alee El-Kálee,<br>\
originally بَسٌّ inf. n., used in the sense of the<br>\
pass. part. n., of بَسَّ السَّوِيقَ, meaning “he moistened, or stirred about, the سويق with clarified<br>\
butter, or with olive-oil, to complete, or perfect,<br>\
its goodness; ” one of the two س s being suppressed, and ن being added; so that it means<br>\
complete, or perfect. (MF. [But this derivation<br>\
seems to be extremely far-fetched.])<br>\
