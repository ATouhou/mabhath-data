بُوقٌ [A trumpet;] a certain thing in which one<br>\
blows; (IDrd, S, Mgh, K;) in which one blows<br>\
as in a musical pipe: (Kr, K:) [mostly used in<br>\
war, but] mentioned by a poet, cited by As, as<br>\
used by the Christians: (S:) IDrd says, The<br>\
Arabs used this word, but I know not its origin:<br>\
Esh-Shiháb says, in the &#39;Ináyeh, that it is arabicized, from [the Persian] بُورِى: (TA: [but this<br>\
is obviously improbable:]) pl. بُوقَاتٌ (Mgh, Msb)<br>\
and بِيقَانٌ (Msb [in my copy of the Mgh, erroneously, بِيَقَاتٌ]) [and أَبْوَاقٌ, a pl. of pauc., commonly used in the present day]. نَفَخَ فِى البُوقِ<br>\
[He blew the trumpet, lit., in the trumpet,] means<br>\
[also] (tropical:)  he spoke that in which was no profit.<br>\
(TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  [Hence,] (assumed tropical:)  One who does not conceal a<br>\
secret; (Lth, JK, K;) as also ↓ بَوْقٌ. (K.) ―<br>\
-b3-<br>\
Also A certain thing in which the miller blows;<br>\
(JK, K;) accord. to the copies of the K, resembling a مِنْقَاب; but this is a mistake: (TA:) it<br>\
is a thing resembling a [shell of the kind called]<br>\
مِنْقَاب, the hole of which is twisted; and sometimes the miller blows in it, raising his voice; and<br>\
what he means thereby is known. (Lth, TA.)<br>\
-A2-<br>\
See also بَوْقٌ.<br>\
بَاقَةٌ A bundle of herbs, or leguminous plants.<br>\
(S, K.) [And in modern Arabic, A bunch of<br>\
flowers.]<br>\
بُوقَةٌ A shower, fall, or storm, of rain, (JK, S,)<br>\
that has burst forth with a dash: (S, TA:) or<br>\
such as is vehement; or disapproved, disliked, or<br>\
deemed evil: (K:) pl. بُوَقٌ. (JK, K.)<br>\
بَؤُوقٌ, or دَاهِيَةٌ بَؤُوقٌ, A vehement calamity or<br>\
misfortune or disaster. (TA.) ―<br>\
-b2-  And the former,<br>\
applied to a man, Thievish; a great thief. (JK.)<br>\
بَائِقَةٌ A calamity, misfortune, or disaster; (JK,<br>\
S, Msb, K;) a vehement evil or mischief; (Msb;)<br>\
a trail that befalls a people: (TA:) pl. بَوَائِقٌ.<br>\
(S, Msb, K.) It is said in a trad., لَا يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ<br>\
مَنْ لَا يَأْمَنُ جَارَهُ بَوَائِقَهُ, meaning, accord. to<br>\
Katádeh, [He will not enter Paradise whose<br>\
neighbour is not secure from] his wrongful, or<br>\
injurious, conduct: or, accord. to Ks, his malevolent, or mischievous, dispositions, and his evil<br>\
conduct. (S.)<br>\
IF says, in the “ Makáyees,” that بوق is not<br>\
an accredited root, and that there is not, in his<br>\
opinion, any correct word belonging to it. (TA.)<br>\
[But this is a strange assertion.]<br>\
