(S * and TA in art. بلعم;) He swallowed it.<br>\
(IAar, TA.) It is said in a proverb, لَا يَصْلُحُ<br>\
رِيقًا ↓ رَفِيقًا مِنْ لمْ يَبْتَلِعْ [He is not suitable, or<br>\
fit, for being a companion who does not swallow<br>\
his spittle; meaning, (assumed tropical:)  who does not restrain his<br>\
anger]. (TA.) You say also, اللُّقْمَةَ ↓ بَلْعَمَ meaning He ate the morsel. (TA in art. بلعم.) And<br>\
بَلَعَ الطَّعَامَ and ↓ ابتلعهُ also signify [He swallowed the food without chewing it;] he did not<br>\

قَدْ بَلَّعَتْ بِى ذُرْأَةٌ فَأَلْحَفَتْ<br>\
[Hoariness, or grayness, or the like, had begun<br>\
to appear, &amp;c., upon me, and marred me]; making the verb trans. by بِ because it has the<br>\
meaning of قَدْ آلَمَتْ [it had given pain, and this<br>\
verb is thus made trans.]; or substituting بِى for<br>\
فِىَّ on account of the measure, which would not<br>\
be right if he said فِىَّ. (TA.) You say also,<br>\
فِيهِ الشَّيْبُ ↓ تبلّع Hoariness appeared upon him.<br>\
(IAar.)<br>\

ابلعهُ الشَّىْءَ (S, K, * TA) He made him to<br>\

مَآءَكِ [Kur xi. 46]; (S, K;) consisting of two<br>\
stars near together; (S;) or two stars, straight<br>\
(مُسْتَوِيَانِ) in course, (IKt, K,) or near together<br>\
and oblique; (TA;) one of them dim, and the<br>\
other bright, and called ↓ بَالِعٌ, as though it swallowed the former, (IKt, K, TA,) namely, the dim<br>\
one, and took its light: (TA:) it rises [aurorally]<br>\
in the last night but one [lit. one night remaining] of كَانُون الآخِر [Jan., O. S.], and sets<br>\
[aurorally] when one night has passed of آب<br>\
[Aug., O. S.]. (IKt, K.) [Accord. to my calculation, it thus rose in Arabia about the commencement of the era of the Flight, on the 29th<br>\
of Jan., O. S., and set aurorally on the 30th of<br>\
July. See مَنَازِلِ القَمَرِ, in art. نزل: and see also<br>\

المُرَعْ وَصَارَ فِى الأَرْضِ لُمَعْ [When Saad-Bula&#39;<br>\

forth in the season called رَبِيع, which is the<br>\
beginning of the breeding-time,] becomes strong<br>\
in his walk, and quick, but not strong to labour,<br>\
and the هُبَع [or young camel brought forth<br>\
in the end of the breeding-time] acquires some<br>\
strength, and attains to him, and the مُرَع, a kind<br>\
of bird, is then, it seems, caught, or snared, [and<br>\
parts differing in colour from the rest become<br>\
apparent in the earth.] (TA.)<br>\
